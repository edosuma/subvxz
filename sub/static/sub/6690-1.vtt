00:24.180 --> 00:27.540
His name is Jan.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.340
I do not know him.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.100
He's from the rig.

00:38.180 --> 00:42.020
You know we do not favor
matrimony with outsiders.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.900
Can you even tell us
what matrimony is?

00:47.300 --> 00:52.100
It's when two people
are joined in God.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.740
Do you really believe
you're capable…

00:54.740 --> 00:56.180
…of bearing the responsibility

00:56.220 --> 00:58.580
…not only for your
own marriage in God,…

00:58.580 --> 01:01.940
…but also another's?

01:02.420 --> 01:04.340
I know I am.

01:06.660 --> 01:11.460
Can you think of
anything of real value…

01:11.940 --> 01:14.820
…that the outsiders have
brought with them?

01:20.100 --> 01:22.020
Their music.

01:27.060 --> 01:30.900
Out you go, Bess McNeill,
and be seated.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.180
<i>Forgot my six- string razor,...</i>

01:48.180 --> 01:51.540
<i>...hit the sky</i>

01:51.540 --> 01:53.460
<i>Halfway to Memphis...</i>

01:53.460 --> 01:56.340
<i>...before I realized</i>

01:57.780 --> 02:01.140
<i>Well, I rang the information...</i>

02:01.620 --> 02:03.060
<i>...my ax was cold</i>

02:04.980 --> 02:09.780
<i>They said she rides
a train to Oreoles</i>

02:10.259 --> 02:12.660
<i>Now it's
a mighty long way...</i>

02:12.660 --> 02:14.580
Bess.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.020
Bess, come on.
Don't be silly.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.460
He's late.

02:17.460 --> 02:18.900
All right, but at least
he's coming.

02:18.900 --> 02:19.860
Get this on, then.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.300
You're going to
ruin your dress.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.700
He's late.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.620
You're being silly.
Come on.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.060
Come on.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.500
Bess, get your clothes on.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.940
Come on.
Don't ruin it.

02:29.940 --> 02:30.900
It's a good day.
Come on.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.500
Bess, you're not supposed to
see him. You know that.

02:39.620 --> 02:40.580
You're going to ruin your...

02:48.740 --> 02:50.180
You're late!

03:17.940 --> 03:18.900
Hey!

03:24.980 --> 03:26.420
Break out the bottles!

03:43.380 --> 03:45.780
Come on.
It's my wedding.

03:53.460 --> 03:56.340
Will you please,
be upstanding for the bride?

03:59.220 --> 04:05.220
<i>The Lord's my Shepherd,</i>

04:05.260 --> 04:08.580
<i>I'll not want;</i>

04:08.620 --> 04:16.260
<i>He makes me come to God...</i>

04:16.300 --> 04:20.579
<i>...in pastures green;</i>

04:21.100 --> 04:24.900
<i>He leadeth me...</i>

04:25.380 --> 04:31.300
<i>...as quiet waters lie</i>

04:32.740 --> 04:36.580
As we stand in thy presence
today, in thy house,

04:36.660 --> 04:40.500
We worship thee as the author…

04:40.500 --> 04:44.740
…of every good
and perfect gift.

04:44.740 --> 04:49.540
Christ loved the church
and gave himself for her.

04:50.020 --> 04:54.340
We should love Chirist
and give ourselves to him.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.140
If it is not too inappropriate...

04:59.140 --> 05:01.540
...may I say that you, Bess,...

05:02.020 --> 05:05.860
...have shown that love and that
commitment in your own life.

05:05.860 --> 05:07.780
It is not once or twice…

05:07.780 --> 05:09.700
…that you have been
in this building,…

05:09.700 --> 05:13.060
…giving your time
and effort to cleaning it.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.460
I know that
you have done that...

05:15.460 --> 05:19.300
...not so as to be
well-thought-of here on earth

05:19.300 --> 05:22.660
...but out of your love
for God in heaven.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.180
Great sermon, father.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.140
Ring the bells, then.

05:47.140 --> 05:50.020
Our church has no bells.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.380
That's not too fun, is it?

06:01.540 --> 06:02.500
Whoo!

06:02.500 --> 06:03.460
Oh!

06:03.460 --> 06:04.900
Yay!

06:04.900 --> 06:07.300
Whoo-hoo!

06:07.300 --> 06:08.740
Ha ha!

06:17.460 --> 06:18.900
This is Dodo.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.340
Oh, the sister-in-law.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.260
We haven't really met, have we?

06:22.660 --> 06:25.540
No. Well, everything
happened so quickly.

06:25.860 --> 06:28.260
What makes you say that?

06:28.300 --> 06:32.100
I just mean...
Well, it did, didn't it?

06:32.500 --> 06:36.340
Are you not happy for me?

06:36.340 --> 06:39.220
Of course I am.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.140
Of course I am.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.260
Come on, Terry.

06:46.260 --> 06:49.140
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

06:52.900 --> 06:54.820
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:54.820 --> 06:56.260
Yee-ha!

06:56.260 --> 06:58.180
Hey!

07:00.100 --> 07:03.540
Yee-ha!
Get along, little dogies!

07:11.380 --> 07:12.820
Bess.

09:05.620 --> 09:08.500
"Dear Bess,

09:08.500 --> 09:10.900
"I've known you for 6 years,...

09:10.900 --> 09:12.340
...and I can definitely say...

09:12.340 --> 09:13.780
...you have the biggest heart...

09:13.780 --> 09:15.700
...of anyone I've ever met."

09:18.820 --> 09:22.660
"It wasn't easy for me here
when I married Sam,...

09:22.660 --> 09:24.580
...but you welcomed me instantly,...

09:24.580 --> 09:26.500
...and I won't ever forget that."

09:28.420 --> 09:31.300
"Your generosity
knows no bounds,...

09:31.300 --> 09:33.700
...like the time when you
lent jack a bike...

09:33.700 --> 09:35.620
...because his was broken,
only it was mine,...

09:35.620 --> 09:37.540
...and I had to walk to work."

09:42.340 --> 09:45.220
"I was furious with you then,...

09:45.220 --> 09:46.180
...but I regret that now,...

09:46.660 --> 09:48.580
...because it's your spirit."

09:50.980 --> 09:52.900
"You'd give anything to anyone."

09:59.140 --> 10:03.460
"When Sam died, I lost
a husband, and you a brother."

10:08.740 --> 10:11.140
"We saw each other through that…

10:11.140 --> 10:13.540
…and promised to
look after one another."

10:14.980 --> 10:17.860
"You are the reason..." sorry.

10:17.860 --> 10:20.260
"I have stayed...

10:20.260 --> 10:23.620
...when I almost gave up
in this cold place,...

10:23.620 --> 10:28.900
...and now your warmth
has embraced another outsider."

10:30.340 --> 10:32.260
"His name is Jan,...

10:32.260 --> 10:35.620
...and I don't know
much about him,...

10:35.620 --> 10:40.420
...but I'll accept
his right to be here...

10:40.420 --> 10:41.860
...because of you, Bess."

10:45.700 --> 10:47.620
"If he doesn't take care of you...

10:47.620 --> 10:49.540
...and give you
everything you need,...

10:49.540 --> 10:50.980
...I'll kill him."

10:53.860 --> 10:58.660
"Thank you for all
you've given me, Bess.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.060
I love you very much."

11:40.180 --> 11:42.100
Have me now?

11:44.020 --> 11:45.940
Here?

11:57.460 --> 12:01.780
Maybe you wanted
something more romantic.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.180
This is lovely.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.180
You sure?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.420
No. Have me.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.780
What do I do?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.140
Ok?

14:09.060 --> 14:11.460
You got blood on your dress.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.700
Shall I go down
and wait for you?

14:37.860 --> 14:39.780
You ok?

14:50.340 --> 14:52.260
Hi.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.220
Yee-hoo!

15:54.580 --> 15:56.020
Take care of yourself.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.420
Go get her now, Jan!

16:15.220 --> 16:17.140
Go get her, Jan!

16:24.340 --> 16:27.300
<i>Every day I spend my time</i>

16:27.300 --> 16:30.180
<i>Drinking wine, feeling fine</i>

16:30.180 --> 16:33.540
<i>Waiting here to find the sign</i>

16:33.540 --> 16:36.900
<i>That I can understand</i>

16:36.900 --> 16:38.820
<i>yes, I am</i>

16:39.300 --> 16:41.700
<i>In the days between the hours</i>

16:41.700 --> 16:43.140
<i>Ivory towers,...</i>

16:43.620 --> 16:44.580
<i>...bloody flowers</i>

16:45.060 --> 16:47.940
<i>Push their heads into the air</i>

16:47.940 --> 16:51.300
<i>I don't care if I ever know</i>

16:51.300 --> 16:53.700
<i>there I go</i>

16:56.580 --> 17:00.900
<i>Don't push your love too far</i>

17:00.900 --> 17:03.780
Can't get this fucker open.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.220
Shit.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.260
<i>Da da da</i>

17:16.260 --> 17:18.180
<i>Da da da</i>

17:23.460 --> 17:25.380
What's so funny?

17:30.580 --> 17:32.020
<i>Da da da</i>

18:20.067 --> 18:21.507
Hmm.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.520
How could you take it?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.400
How could you keep
away from the boys?

18:46.280 --> 18:48.680
I waited for you.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.040
No. Don't laugh.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.920
Yeah.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.680
But you must
have been lonely.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.600
Who did you talk to?

19:05.480 --> 19:09.320
I thank you for
the greatest gift of all:

19:09.320 --> 19:10.760
the gift of love.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.120
I thank you for Jan.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.880
I'm so lucky to have been
given these gifts.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.080
But remember to be
a good girl, Bess,...

19:27.560 --> 19:31.400
...for you know I giveth
and I taketh away.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.680
What? I didn't mean it
like that.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.960
Yes. I'll be good.
I'll be really, really good.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.680
Thank you.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.560
What did you say?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.920
Thank you.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.480
Fly.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.400
Aaaaaway!

21:17.080 --> 21:18.520
Oh!

21:45.240 --> 21:46.680
Hello, Jan.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.640
Hello.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.600
Bess.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.560
Hello.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.480
Why don't you have
any church bells?

21:55.480 --> 21:59.320
We do not need bells in
our church to worship God.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.080
I like church bells.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.400
Let's put them back again.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.680
Have fun.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.160
But now, friends,...

22:23.160 --> 22:27.000
...things have become
very different.

22:28.920 --> 22:32.280
It hurts me
to have to say it,...

22:32.280 --> 22:36.120
...but there appears to be
those in the church...

22:36.600 --> 22:42.360
...who are prepared to
cling to the world...

22:42.360 --> 22:45.240
...instead of fleeing from it.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.640
But those to whom I refer...

22:47.640 --> 22:51.960
...will know what I
am speaking about.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.360
It grieves my heart,...

22:54.840 --> 22:57.240
...and I know there are others...

22:57.240 --> 22:59.640
...who feel just the same.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.080
Amen.

23:03.960 --> 23:09.720
Mr. Donald John Beaton, will you
rise and address the question?

23:16.920 --> 23:20.280
Thank you, Lord, for this day
you have blessed us with.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.600
It's stupid that only men
can talk in the service.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.480
Hold your tongue, woman.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.400
<i>Lassie! It's Lassie!</i>

23:51.480 --> 23:55.320
<i>It is Lassie, I know it!</i>

23:55.320 --> 23:58.680
<i>Lassie! Oh, Lassie!</i>

24:01.080 --> 24:05.880
<i>Lassie. Oh, Lassie.
Oh, welcome home.</i>

24:18.280 --> 24:21.160
They're burying anthony now.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.400
Go and listen to the minister.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.840
What?

24:28.840 --> 24:31.240
Yeah. You can do
that if you want.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.160
Men are allowed at funerals.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.000
Go on.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.080
Anthony dod mantle,
who has been one...

24:57.000 --> 24:59.880
Anthony dod mantle,
you are a sinner...

24:59.880 --> 25:02.760
...and you deserve
your place in hell.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.560
The minister said
he would go to hell.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.480
Did he say that?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.640
Bloody cheerful.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.960
Will anthony go to hell.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.400
Everyone knows that.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.560
You do realize...

25:36.040 --> 25:37.960
...that I will have to go back
soon, don't you?

26:00.520 --> 26:03.400
You knew it all the time.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.640
"Lord, we are unworthy of
the least of all thy mercies.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.040
We thank thee for this food.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.920
Pardon our sins
for Jesus' sake. Amen."

26:17.400 --> 26:18.360
Amen.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.120
When are you going back?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.560
Oh, didn't you know?

26:37.560 --> 26:40.440
Jan's going to stay
at home with me...

26:40.440 --> 26:43.800
...quit the rig because
we're so happy.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.200
Bess, come on.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.560
I wish I could.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.720
I will not have that kind of
behavior in my house!

27:13.720 --> 27:16.120
I'm sorry, mother.
I'm sorry.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.040
If you cannot
control your moods,...

27:18.520 --> 27:19.960
...It's the hospital again
for you, my girl.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.320
Why should you
be any different?

27:23.320 --> 27:26.200
Every woman around here
has to learn to be alone…

27:26.200 --> 27:28.600
…when their man's away
at sea or on the oil rigs.

27:28.920 --> 27:33.240
Even you can learn
how to endure.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.720
I don't even know
who you are.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.520
I don't know
anything about you,...

27:55.000 --> 27:56.440
...and quite frankly...

27:56.920 --> 27:58.360
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to say this,...

27:58.360 --> 27:59.800
...but I don't trust you.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.920
She's...
She's very susceptible.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.200
And you could
get her t...

28:17.560 --> 28:19.480
You could get her to do
anything you wanted.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.840
No. I don't think so.

28:24.280 --> 28:28.120
How am I supposed to
look out for her now?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.960
What do you want to do?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.360
Keep her here, locked up
for the rest of her life?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.280
She hasn't got the strength.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.720
She's stronger than you and me.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.640
You don't understand, do you?

28:39.640 --> 28:41.080
She's not right in the head.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.960
Come on.
She just wants it all.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.920
What's this?

29:04.920 --> 29:05.880
What?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.240
What?

29:10.680 --> 29:12.600
What's that?

29:12.600 --> 29:14.040
What's that?

29:16.440 --> 29:18.840
It's a present.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.600
Can I open it?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.040
Yeah, sure. Open it.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.040
Nice colors, aren't they?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.480
Very cheerful.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.800
It's open.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.720
We've been
waiting for you, bud.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.160
Hey.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.720
Yeah. That's fine.
You want a little snort?

30:22.760 --> 30:24.680
Look at you.
Ha ha ha!

31:25.320 --> 31:26.760
Bess!

31:42.920 --> 31:44.840
No!

31:44.840 --> 31:46.760
Aah!

31:47.000 --> 31:48.920
No!

31:58.520 --> 32:00.440
Come, come, come.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.680
All right?

32:19.640 --> 32:22.040
It's ok.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.480
It's ok.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.720
Whoo!
Watch your head!

32:45.720 --> 32:48.600
Wum! Ha ha ha!

32:48.600 --> 32:50.520
Watch your head.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.920
Ok?

32:57.240 --> 32:59.160
It's just for a little.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.960
I'll call you.

33:18.840 --> 33:21.240
Jan!

33:55.160 --> 33:57.560
No!

33:57.560 --> 33:58.520
Bess!

34:00.440 --> 34:01.880
No!

34:04.760 --> 34:06.200
Bess!

34:26.840 --> 34:30.679
You're going
to be all right, dear.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.600
Ok? You're ok.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.880
It's all right, darling.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.440
It's all right.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.120
It's all right.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.560
It's ok.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.000
It's all right, dear.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.920
Let's give you one of these.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.240
One of these down you.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.560
Here we go.
Take one of these.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.480
That's it.
Pop it in your mouth.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.400
Swallow.

35:37.160 --> 35:42.600
<i>Who would be a poor man,
a beggar man, a thief?</i>

35:42.600 --> 35:47.880
<i>If he had a rich man
in his hand?</i>

35:47.880 --> 35:52.680
<i>And who would steal the candy
from a laughing baby's mouth?</i>

35:53.160 --> 35:58.440
<i>If he could take it
from the money man?</i>

35:58.440 --> 36:03.240
<i>Cross eyed Mary
a- goes jumping in again</i>

36:03.720 --> 36:05.640
<i>She signs no contract</i>

36:05.640 --> 36:08.040
<i>but she always
plays the game</i>

36:08.520 --> 36:11.880
<i>She dines in Hampstead village...</i>

36:15.240 --> 36:20.040
You are guilty of selfishness, Bess.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.400
You didn't even consider
for one second…

36:23.400 --> 36:26.760
…how painful
it must have been for him.

36:26.760 --> 36:30.120
You put your own feelings
before everyone else's.

36:30.120 --> 36:35.400
I can't see that you love him
when you behave like that.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.200
Now you must promise
to be a good girl, Bess.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.800
I promise to be a good girl.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.400
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved, mother.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.280
It's all right, Bessie.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.120
Mother, would it be ok...

37:18.120 --> 37:21.000
...if I came home for a bit
while Jan's away?

37:21.080 --> 37:23.480
Of course it would, Bessie.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.880
Ok.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.800
You got it.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.040
A little bit of this shit.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.480
Mmm.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.320
Oh, shit.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.440
Nice.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.360
Huh?

38:02.360 --> 38:05.240
You know, the waves are
getting pretty heavy.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.120
JesusCchrist. What the
fuck's wrong with you?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.560
Just pissed.
Just give me one.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.960
Just wait.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.840
Now, but you know,
there's some nice...

38:15.320 --> 38:16.280
Shit. Sorry, guys.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.200
Just throw
the goddamn radio away.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.120
You can't get anything
in here anyhow.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.000
You and your fucking radio.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.320
Oh, God! Fuck. Jeez!

38:27.800 --> 38:29.240
Come on. Dance! Dance!

38:29.240 --> 38:30.920
Yee-ha! Yee-ha!
Yee-ha!

38:30.920 --> 38:33.320
Yee-ha!

38:33.560 --> 38:37.400
Fire! Fire!

38:37.400 --> 38:38.840
Wet towel!

38:38.840 --> 38:39.800
Just...shit!

38:39.800 --> 38:41.240
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

38:41.240 --> 38:42.200
Hey!

38:42.200 --> 38:44.120
Bueno! Bueno! Bueno!

38:59.320 --> 39:02.200
Didn't he say he'd call?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.120
Do you want me
to wait with you?

39:06.040 --> 39:07.960
Yes, please.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.520
Where the fuck
is the second shift?

39:12.520 --> 39:14.440
I got a phone call to make.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.000
I got to go
to the hospital.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.840
Are you cold?

39:26.840 --> 39:27.800
No.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.240
No?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.640
You're all right?

39:31.640 --> 39:34.040
Don't wait too long, will you?

39:47.800 --> 39:49.720
Oh, shit.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.920
Pim, got to make
a phone call.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.360
Get out of here.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.120
Hello?

40:38.120 --> 40:40.520
Oh, is Bess there?

40:40.520 --> 40:42.440
One moment.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.840
Bess. Bess.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.480
Is that you, Bess?

40:55.480 --> 40:56.440
Hi.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.720
Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't
get to the phone earlier.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.640
That's ok.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.800
Don't you love me anymore?

41:05.800 --> 41:09.880
Oh...
Of course I do.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.560
Say so, then.

41:11.560 --> 41:16.840
I'd made up
my mind not to.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.720
Everyone says that
I love you too much…

41:19.720 --> 41:22.120
…and if you found out…

41:22.120 --> 41:24.520
…how much I loved you,...

41:24.520 --> 41:26.920
...you might get upset…

41:26.920 --> 41:30.280
...because we're not
together right now.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.200
Oh, Bess, never stop
saying you love me.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.640
You hear?

41:33.640 --> 41:35.080
Yes.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.520
No matter what anybody says.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.880
Yes.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.680
Say it, then.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.920
I love you so much.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.160
I love you, too.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.680
I can hear you breathing.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.440
Can you hear me?

42:49.320 --> 42:51.240
What are you thinking?

42:53.160 --> 42:56.040
That you're here.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.920
And what are you doing?

42:58.920 --> 43:05.160
Um... I'm touching your arms…

43:05.160 --> 43:08.520
…and your chest…

43:08.520 --> 43:12.360
…and your tummy

43:12.360 --> 43:16.200
and...

43:17.640 --> 43:20.040
...your prick.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.880
You're so huge.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.760
Ha ha ha!

43:26.760 --> 43:32.520
Jan will be home in
ten days for a week.

43:32.520 --> 43:33.960
Pardon?

43:34.440 --> 43:38.280
Jan will be home in
ten days for a week.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.160
Pits.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.120
Hi.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.520
What are you doing here?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.920
Where's Jan?

43:46.920 --> 43:50.280
I'm the only one back.
Hurt my wrist.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.720
They sent me home.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.680
Oh.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.080
He sends his love.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.440
How long have
you got off now?

43:58.440 --> 43:59.880
Only three days.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.240
Oh.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.240
Yeah. You know me.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.040
I'm back.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.960
Oh, sorry.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.000
How long
has she been asleep?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.920
What's the matter with you?

44:20.920 --> 44:22.840
Cat got your tongue?

44:25.720 --> 44:28.120
Have you taken my calendar?

44:28.120 --> 44:30.040
Huh?

44:30.040 --> 44:31.960
Have you taken my calendar?

44:31.960 --> 44:33.400
No, I have not.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.320
What would I want
with your calendar?

44:35.320 --> 44:37.240
Don't be ridiculous.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.680
You've taken it.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.120
I have not taken it.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.040
Yes, you have.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.400
What calendar?

44:49.720 --> 44:51.640
Where is it?

45:03.880 --> 45:06.280
Bess, you've got to
stop all this, you know.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.680
You've got to go on living
when he isn't here.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.600
I mean, he's not dead.
You're not dead.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.520
You know what I mean?

45:12.520 --> 45:16.360
You've got to stop it.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.840
Shh. It's all right.
It's nothing.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.760
What's going on?

45:42.760 --> 45:44.200
Go back to sleep.
It's all right.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.640
Was that Bess?

45:45.640 --> 45:47.560
No. It's ok.
It's all right.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.600
Bit of hysterics.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.040
No, no. It's all right.
I'll sort it out.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.480
We're not to have this
carry on in the house.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.400
I know. Just stay where you are.
Go back to sleep.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.840
It's terrible.

46:10.600 --> 46:15.880
Bess McNeill, for many years,
you've prayed for love.

46:15.880 --> 46:18.280
Shall I take it away
from you again?

46:18.280 --> 46:20.200
Is that what you want?

46:21.640 --> 46:25.480
Oh, no.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.400
I'm still grateful for love.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.680
What do you want, then?

46:37.480 --> 46:41.320
I pray for Jan to come home.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.600
He will be coming
home in ten days.

46:46.600 --> 46:49.480
You must learn to endure.
You know that.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.680
Oh, I can't wait.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.360
This is unlike you, Bess.

47:04.360 --> 47:08.680
Out there, there are people
who need Jan and his work.

47:08.680 --> 47:10.600
What about them?

47:14.440 --> 47:19.720
They don't matter.
Nothing else matters.

47:19.720 --> 47:23.560
I just want Jan home again.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.440
I pray to you.

47:26.440 --> 47:30.280
Oh, please,
won't you send him home?

47:34.600 --> 47:38.440
Are you sure
that's what you want?

47:42.760 --> 47:45.160
Yes.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.240
Ok. Get her up.

48:21.320 --> 48:23.240
Blow out!

48:24.200 --> 48:26.120
Get away!
Blow out!

48:26.120 --> 48:27.560
Terry!

48:27.560 --> 48:28.520
Terry!

48:36.760 --> 48:38.200
Terry! Terry!

48:41.480 --> 48:42.440
Terry!

48:48.520 --> 48:50.120
Talk to me, will you?

49:07.720 --> 49:08.680
Watch out!

49:10.280 --> 49:12.200
Jan!

49:12.200 --> 49:15.560
Go get... get a medic!

49:33.640 --> 49:36.520
I don't know what kind of
condition he's in.

49:36.520 --> 49:39.800
I think it's very serious, though.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.720
I don't quite know.

49:48.440 --> 49:51.800
It's Jan. There's been
an accident on the rig.

50:44.680 --> 50:47.080
Jan, can you hear me?

50:51.400 --> 50:53.320
Oh.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.160
What are you doing?

51:03.160 --> 51:05.560
I'm holding your hand.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.000
Don't touch me.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.440
Don't touch me!

51:08.440 --> 51:09.880
Jan, relax.
Just take...

51:22.600 --> 51:24.040
Sit down here.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.760
All right.
All right.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.160
Shh. Deep breath.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.560
Hello.
Talk to me, darling.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.480
Talk to me.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.920
Talk to me.

51:39.400 --> 51:40.840
Come on.
It's all right.

51:43.240 --> 51:45.160
It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

52:04.500 --> 52:06.420
Uh, they're going
to operate straightaway.

52:06.420 --> 52:08.820
It will be a few hours,...

52:09.300 --> 52:10.260
...so I think we better wait...

52:10.260 --> 52:12.180
Bess.

52:12.180 --> 52:15.060
Bess, you can't go in there.

52:15.060 --> 52:16.500
It's not allowed.
I want to be with him.

52:16.500 --> 52:17.460
I know you do.
I know.

52:17.460 --> 52:18.420
But come on. Come with me.
Come on.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.820
No. I want to see him
all the time.

52:20.820 --> 52:23.700
Bess, it's not a good idea.
Come on.

52:23.700 --> 52:26.580
Bess. Bess, please,
you can't stay here.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.500
It's just not possible.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.460
Bess!

52:29.460 --> 52:31.380
Can I have
a word with you?

52:31.380 --> 52:34.740
Stay there, all right?
Don't move.

53:02.180 --> 53:05.060
I want you
to pray with me.

53:07.460 --> 53:08.740
But...

53:08.900 --> 53:10.340
Please.

53:24.420 --> 53:28.740
Dear god,
we pray that you…

53:29.220 --> 53:32.100
…will hold your hand
over Jan…

53:32.580 --> 53:35.940
…and not let him die.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.380
Amen.

54:11.220 --> 54:14.580
Mrs. Nyman, will you please
come with me?

54:42.900 --> 54:45.300
Will he live?

54:45.300 --> 54:52.020
We have stabilized your husband's
condition for the time being.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.300
Will he live?

54:57.300 --> 55:00.180
Yes. Yes, Bess,
He will live.

55:07.860 --> 55:11.220
Your husband suffered
very serious injuries.

55:13.140 --> 55:16.500
Life shouldn't always
be preserved at any cost.

55:18.660 --> 55:20.580
What do you mean?

55:23.460 --> 55:25.860
Um, well, the doctor
means, Bess...

55:25.860 --> 55:29.700
...that, um, sometimes...

55:30.180 --> 55:33.060
...in some cases when
life isn't worth living,...

55:33.060 --> 55:36.420
...then it may
be better to die.

55:41.220 --> 55:46.980
You don't know Jan, or you
could not say such a thing.

55:48.420 --> 55:51.780
Your husband
may never walk again.

55:51.780 --> 55:55.140
We think he'll be
completely paralyzed.

55:57.060 --> 55:58.980
But he'll live?

55:58.980 --> 56:02.820
Yes. He will live,
it seems.

56:12.020 --> 56:13.620
Father.

56:15.060 --> 56:17.460
Are you there?

56:17.460 --> 56:19.380
Are you still there?

56:23.700 --> 56:26.100
Of course I am, Bess.

56:26.100 --> 56:27.540
You know that.

56:36.660 --> 56:39.060
What's happening?

56:44.340 --> 56:47.700
You wanted Jan home.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.460
I've changed my mind.

56:53.460 --> 56:55.380
Why did I ask for that?

56:58.260 --> 56:59.700
Because you're...

57:00.180 --> 57:02.580
...a stupid little girl, Bess.

57:02.580 --> 57:05.460
I had to test you.

57:05.460 --> 57:09.300
Your love for Jan
has been put to the test.

57:17.460 --> 57:18.900
Thank you…

57:18.900 --> 57:20.820
…for not letting him die.

57:25.620 --> 57:27.540
You're welcome, Bess.

57:42.500 --> 57:48.260
<i>he said
"there is no reason</i>

57:48.260 --> 57:51.140
<i>And the truth
is plain to see"</i>

57:54.020 --> 57:57.860
<i>But I wandered
through my playing cards</i>

58:00.260 --> 58:03.620
<i>And would not let her be</i>

58:06.500 --> 58:10.340
<i>One of 16 vestal virgins</i>

58:12.740 --> 58:15.620
<i>Who were leaving
for the coast</i>

58:18.980 --> 58:23.300
<i>And although
my eyes were open</i>

58:25.220 --> 58:28.580
<i>They might just as well
have been closed</i>

58:28.580 --> 58:30.980
<i>And so it was...</i>

58:30.980 --> 58:34.820
I would say to you...

58:34.820 --> 58:38.180
...that if there is one of
these commandments...

58:38.180 --> 58:43.460
...which you do not love
and do not obey,...

58:43.460 --> 58:47.300
...you have no place
at the Lord's table.

59:10.940 --> 59:12.380
When did you get back?

59:12.380 --> 59:13.820
I came back with Jan.

59:14.300 --> 59:16.220
Oh, it's good to see you.

59:32.340 --> 59:35.100
Oh, surf's up!

59:35.100 --> 59:36.180
Hi.

59:36.180 --> 59:37.140
Hi, guys.

59:37.620 --> 59:38.580
How you doing, buddy?

59:38.580 --> 59:40.500
Well, fine.
How are you?

59:40.500 --> 59:41.940
Ok.

59:44.820 --> 59:46.260
Did you find anything?

59:46.740 --> 59:48.180
Gas.

59:48.180 --> 59:49.620
Nothing really.

59:49.620 --> 59:51.540
Ha ha!
Guess what, now.

59:51.540 --> 59:52.980
We're heading up north.

59:52.980 --> 59:54.420
Well, north,
that's good.

59:54.900 --> 59:57.300
That's where you
always said the oil was.

59:57.660 --> 59:59.580
What are you doing here, anyway?

59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.500
We're meant to be
out drilling.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.380
I just felt like

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.780
Putting my feet up
for a while.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.260
I didn't trust you
two guys out there alone.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.460
Oh, my...

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.340
My arms aren't ok, so...

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.740
I'm not thirsty, anyway.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.540
Bullshit!

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.420
Hey, come on.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.860
Come on.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.180
Oh, man, sorry.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.860
Oh, man, sorry.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.780
Ok.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.700
Thank you.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.860
I'm not really supposed to
have any visitors, so...

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.260
We really don't have
the time, either.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.180
Ha ha ha! Ok.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.100
You take care of yourself, huh?

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.980
Take care.
Get well soon.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.420
See you, guys.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.860
Will you do
something for me?

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.300
Yes.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.620
The next time you come,...

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.060
...could you wear something more...

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.900
More loose...

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.700
So I, uh...

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.100
So I won't have to see your body.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.940
Bess, you'll have to go now...

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.860
...because Jan needs to rest.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.780
All right.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.940
You shouldn't get him
too overemotional, you know.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.860
It's not good for him.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.260
I'm sorry.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.660
You got to cheer him up.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.940
Is he asleep now?

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.860
Well, he should be...

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.260
…the amount I've given him.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.260
Would it be all right...

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.140
...If I went and had
a look at him?

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.740
I love you, Jan.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.740
I love you, too, Bess.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.100
You are the love of my life.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.740
Bess.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.540
Where have you been?

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.940
I've been to the church.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.220
What, at 2:00 in the morning?

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.380
I don't want you
getting ill again...

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.300
…like you did
when Sam died.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.220
I said I've been
to the church.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.140
It has nothing to do
with the church.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.500
Did you hear what I said?
Did you?

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.340
I don't want you
to get ill again

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.740
Like you did when Sam died.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.100
I've had a word with
Dr. Richardson, all right?

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.980
And he says
he could see you tomorrow.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.380
Oh, can he?

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.460
Bess, would you like
to come in?

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.100
Dodo said I had to come.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.820
She has this idea
about me treating you.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.060
My predecessor admitted you
a few years ago.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.420
Well, why did he do that?

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.820
I don't know.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.220
No, nor do I.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.100
You were upset because
your brother had died...

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.700
...and now you're upset
because your husband's ill.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.620
Nothing unusual about that.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.900
Am I not going to
have some pills?

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.300
I'm probably not like
your old doctor.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.700
I don't think that people
should be given pills...

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.620
...just because they do
what's only natural.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.700
Maybe showing what you feel
isn't the done thing...

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.140
...from where you come from,...

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.540
...but it's certainly no disease.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.380
What...happened on the rig...

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.300
...was my fault.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.180
How come?

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.980
I prayed to God
to send him home.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.300
Well...

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.580
Well...

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.460
What powers you possess.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.900
Do you really...

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.780
Do you really believe
that you possess such powers?

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.940
I know you people believe
a lot about yourselves.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.380
Bess...

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.780
Perhaps you should do
a bit of grieving…

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.220
…for yourself
instead of him.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.620
I think you should
come and see me...

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.540
...now and again
if you feel like it.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.100
I'm sorry.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.540
Oh. Ha ha!

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.980
Come on.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.660
Well, things will pick up
once he gets home again.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.060
<i>Well, she's my woman of gold</i>

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.940
<i>Yes, she's not very old,
uh-huh, huh</i>

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.260
<i>Well, she's my woman
of gold</i>

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.140
<i>Yes, she's not very old,
uh-huh, huh</i>

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.940
<i>I don't mean
to be bold, uh</i>

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.780
<i>But, uh, may I hold
your hand?</i>

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.180
<i>Well, she ain't
no witch</i>

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.060
<i>and I love the way she twitch
, uh-huh, huh</i>

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.380
<i>Well, she ain't
no witch</i>

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:56.740
<i>and I love the way she twitch
, uh-huh, huh...</i>

01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.580
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.940
<i>Squashed tomatoes
and stew</i>

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.900
<i>You look like a monkey</i>

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.740
<i>and I thought it was you</i>

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.780
Look at that.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.220
Special.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.140
Shall I open your present?

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.580
Yes.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.460
Your presents.

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:27.700
Can you see all right?

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.500
What is it?

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.939
Wait and see.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.180
Ha ha ha!

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.100
I don't believe it.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.020
Where did you get that?

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.939
I got it in a shop.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.779
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.660
Oh, look, it's not
doing anything now.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.060
Ahem. All right, go on. Well, go on.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.819
That is just terrible.

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:15.220
That is daft, that is
completely daft.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.979
Happy birthday, Jan.

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:19.420
Thank you.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.859
I'll see you later.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.580
Do you like it?

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.939
Oh, yes, it's...

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:32.380
Ha ha!

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.779
It's... it's nice.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.140
I'll give you your pill.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.060
Ok?

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.500
Oh...

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.940
One more drink.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.740
Ok?

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.660
Yeah. Thank you.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.140
Happy birthday.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.500
I'm finished, Bess.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.820
No.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.860
You could take a lover…

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.780
…without anybody noticing...

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.180
…but you can't
divorce me.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.100
They'd never let you.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.460
Bess.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.420
No. No.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.060
Is that what
you think I want?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.900
You cripple!

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.180
You must make up with him.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.100
A husband and wife…

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.980
…have to be able
to talk to each other.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.380
He's the one who is helpless,...

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.820
...and you're the one...

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.180
...who must show you're strong.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.580
Go to him and tell him...

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.460
…you are sorry
you were angry.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.380
You have God.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.300
You have the strength...

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.660
...your life in God
has bestowed upon you,...

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:18.100
...and that is a strength
he does not possess.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.340
Oh, no.

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.740
Come on.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.140
Come on.
you're all right.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.940
Come on. That's it.

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.820
That's it.
It's all right.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:33.220
It's all right.
All right, all right.

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.420
What's she thinking of...

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.300
Going off leaving you like this?

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.700
You must admit that she was...

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.460
She was happy
when we got married.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.060
She blossomed...

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.460
Didn't she?

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.500
I can't just lie here.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.220
I can't even
make love to her.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.820
She's got to
get out of here.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.620
She's got to get on with life.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.540
Help me set her free.

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.540
She'd do anything for you, Jan.

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.460
You know that.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.860
She don't care…
…anything about herself...

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.700
…but she'd do
anything for you...

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.020
just to see a smile
on your face.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.420
Do you understand me?

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.700
Yeah.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.620
Right.

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.580
Thanks for telling me.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.020
No trouble.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.300
Do you want me
to read to you?

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.220
Hmm?

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.540
Are you all right?

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.420
They took him back
to the hospital.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.100
Bess.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.540
Bess, what is going on?

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.940
He went unconscious.
We had to bring him back here.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.860
At home anymore...

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.300
Not if you're going to go running off...

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.740
...and leaving him like that.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.180
I'm sorry.

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.100
Well, it's just not
good enough!

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.500
I'm not... I'm not even allowed
to kiss him anymore.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.860
Why don't you try listening to
what he says, Bess?

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.300
It's up to you.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.700
He ain't got anyone else.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.620
You could give him
the will to live.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.020
That's more than
any doctor can do.

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.340
Bess?

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.380
I'm sorry.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.580
No, it was my fault.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.020
Come here.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.740
Hi.

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.420
Hi.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.780
Love is a mighty power...

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.660
Isn't it?

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.420
If I die...

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.500
It will be because love
cannot keep me alive.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.860
But I can hardly remember...

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.860
...what it's like to make love.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.740
And if I forget that...

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.780
...then I'll die.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.340
Remember when I phoned
you from the rig?

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.700
We made love
without being together.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.620
Do you want me to talk
to you like that again?

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:52.580
I'd love to.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.020
Bess.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.780
I want you to find
a man to make love to...

01:17:59.988 --> 01:18:03.348
...and then come back here
and tell me about it.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.980
It will feel like you and me
being together again.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.340
Now, that...
that will keep me alive.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.600
I...I can't.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.400
This morning when I...
When I told you to get a lover,

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.800
It wasn't for your sake.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.240
It was for my sake...

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.760
...because I don't want to die.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.920
I'm afraid.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.240
Do you understand?

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.480
Yes.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.880
It will be you and me, Bess.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.800
Do it for me.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.760
I...

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.680
I can't.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.160
Please.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.120
Bess?

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.560
Are you all right?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.440
Sure?

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.680
Here you go.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.720
Whoa-oh. Easy.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.000
<i>Suzanne takes you down...</i>

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.320
<i>...to her place near the river</i>

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.200
<i>You can hear the boats go by,...</i>

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.520
<i>...you can spend the night, beside her.</i>

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.880
<i>And you know
that she's half crazy,</i>

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.720
<i>But that's why
you want to be there</i>

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.600
<i>and she feeds you
tea and oranges...</i>

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.960
<i>...that come all the way from China</i>

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.800
<i>And just when you mean
to tell her,...</i>

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.160
<i>that you have no love
to give her</i>

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.480
<i>Then she gets you
on her wavelength</i>

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.360
<i>And she lets the river answer</i>

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.440
<i>That you've always been her lover</i>

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.080
You certainly needed
some shuteye.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.320
I put your rose
in a vase.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.240
Perked up a bit.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.600
You should think of
yourself a bit, too.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.000
Go out.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.840
Go dancing.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.760
I've seen you dance.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.040
You like to dance.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.600
Where's Jan?

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.720
There's nothing
you can do in here.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.160
Don't let him die.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.880
And why shouldn't
I let him die?

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.680
I love him.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.440
So you keep saying,
but I don't see it.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:39.240
There's nothing I can do.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.640
There's nothing at all.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.680
Prove to me that you love him...

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.120
...and then I'll let him live.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.800
I've come to dance.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.040
It's great. you're great.
great movement,

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.960
But, um, maybe
you could talk to me.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.360
<i>And love
lies bleeding in my hand</i>

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.680
<i>Oh, it kills me to think
of you with another man</i>

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.200
<i>I was playing...</i>

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.120
Bess, stop dancing.
talk to me.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.040
<i>But my guitar
couldn't hold you</i>

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.000
<i>So I split the band</i>

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.200
Bess...

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.600
Talk to me.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.960
Give me five minutes.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.480
You can touch me now.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:38.200
You can have me now.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.120
Bess, listen to me.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.520
We're not
going to make love.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.440
Now put your clothes back on.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.760
Don't you want me?

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.480
Don't you like me? You said
that you liked me.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.400
Yes, Bess, I like you.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.320
Now put your clothes on.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.160
But you don't understand. I'll...

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.080
I'll be good to you, and...

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.800
I want us to make love.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.200
Listen. Um, Bess,

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.600
If you want to talk to me...

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.000
...we can meet at the hospital.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.880
Now just put your clothes on, Bess.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.320
No...

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.200
Please. I don't know
what to do with you.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.520
All right, now just put
your clothes on, Bess,...

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.920
...and go home.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.840
No.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:47.320
I'm lying on my back, all naked.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.240
And...

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.120
...he comes in, and he sees me.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.320
And he kisses my breasts.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.640
Um...

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.440
And he enters me...

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.200
And...

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.520
And he's making love to me...

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.320
Gently...

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.720
And...

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.080
He's coming.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.760
It was Dr. Richardson.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.240
Hi.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.200
Hi, Bess.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.600
Where are you going, then?

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.920
Jan, we're going to
take you off the respirator...

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.800
...for five minutes to exercise
your lungs a little bit...

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.240
...and see how you are,...

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.640
...so just relax
and take it easy.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.800
Ok, start to breathe
by yourself, now, Jan.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.200
Just take very deep breaths.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.120
Slowly.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.040
That's it.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.440
And again.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.200
Very good.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.600
Deep breaths.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.040
Now, that's it.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.560
Bess.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.000
Yes?

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.960
What are you doing
on this bus?

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.880
Which bus, Jan?

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.560
Come to me. Come.

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.160
I'm here.
I'm here in the back.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.600
Yes.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.520
In the back of the bus.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.480
Yeah.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.440
Come.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.120
Dodo. Dodo.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.000
Jan.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.920
Go and get Dr. Richardson.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.760
I'm going to put you back
on the respirator now, Jan.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.600
Jan, can you hear me?

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.520
Are you awake?

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.360
Talk to me.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.440
Hi, Bess.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.320
I'd like to have
a chat with you.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.680
Bess.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.400
This is my bus... My bus.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.480
Forgive me, father.
I have sinned.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.640
Mary Magdalene sinned,...

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.520
...and she is among
my dearly beloved.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.960
I go to the back
of the bus...

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.360
...and you're there.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.480
And you're so huge...

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.800
...that you're almost
bursting out of your pants.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.920
And I undo your fly...

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.680
...and I touch you.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.800
I'm touching your prick.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.400
Have you been in to see Jan?

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.800
How is he?

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.240
Better.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.680
He's better?

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.120
Just a bit.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.280
Hey, Bess, it looks like…

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.720
…your prayers
have been answered.

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.080
We've been able to take
him off the respirator.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.000
Good news, isn't it?

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.520
Do you think...

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.760
...that we turn
to different people

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.120
...when we get close to the edge?

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.000
And that we, um...

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.280
...we turn bad when we're going to die?

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.520
You're not going to die.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.880
I know you're not.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.760
I promise you.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.840
<i>When are you
gonna come down?</i>

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.680
<i>When are you going to land?</i>

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.560
<i>I should have stayed
on the farm</i>

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880
<i>I should have listened
to my old man?</i>

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.720
<i>you know you can't hold me forever</i>

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.560
<i>I didn't sign up with you</i>

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.400
<i>I'm not a present
for your friends to open</i>

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.760
<i>This boy's too young to be singing...</i>

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.560
<i>...the blues...</i>

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.880
Oh, look.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.960
Here you go.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.200
Hey, hey, girlies!
We found some shroomies!

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.880
Don't get your hopes
up too high, will you?

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.240
Dr. Richardson says that
Jan could get worse again.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.560
I'm the one
who saved his life.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.480
I can save it again.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.800
Bess, what are you
talking about?

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:19.080
I told Jan stories...
Stories about love.

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.920
That was almost like
being together, him and me.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.760
You see, love can save Jan.

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.160
He must not forget about love.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.600
He told me that.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.480
He tells me what to do.

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:36.360
Bess, I'm glad that
you listened to Jan,...

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.240
...but don't let him gain
too much power over you.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.400
Sickness is a mighty power.

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.840
I've saved Jan.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:45.720
Don't talk like that.
It's stupid!

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.560
You always said
that I wasn't stupid.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.960
Well, you're stupid if you
say things like that.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.480
Why are you saying
I'm stupid now?

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.880
Because I can see
that you're disappearing...

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.320
...into a world
of make-believe,...

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.240
...and it worries me.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.680
I used to go mad...

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.120
...when people called you stupid,...

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.280
But... you are stupid!

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.600
We're going to put
a drain in this afternoon.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.440
It'll be much easier
to get through to him.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.320
Don't worry.
It's a very minor operation.

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.600
Are you trying to
make me feel guilty?

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.000
What makes you say that?

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.560
I think she's trying
to make me feel guilty.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.680
Come here.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.120
You look fucking awful.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.480
Why do you dress like that?

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.200
You dress like a widow.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.840
I'm not even dead yet.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.120
Maybe you wish I was.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.920
No. No, no.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.160
You haven't done
what I asked you to do.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.600
I have!

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.480
I asked you to be with a man.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.400
I have done that.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.280
You call that
being with a man?

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.200
I call it a joke.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.160
I love you. I don't love
some other man.

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.520
Prove it.

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.560
Bess, what is going on?

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.840
Are you sleeping with other men
to feed his sick fantasies?

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.760
He did get better.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.160
No, he did not
get better!

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.600
That's just the way
it goes, Bess.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.520
Sometimes he's better;
Sometimes he's worse.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.880
It has nothing to do with what you're
doing. That's all in your mind.

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.200
He is my husband, and god has
said that I must honor him.

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.640
Well, if that's what
honoring is all about...

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.040
...then I must have
something wrong.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.440
Well, you don't come from
around here, do you?

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.840
No, and I'm glad I don't.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.200
With locals talking.
It makes me sick.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.080
But you live here,
and you go to the church.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:27.400
Yes, but it don't mean I don't
look at things me own way.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.280
Why don't you move, then?
Your husband's dead.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.840
You know very well
why I don't move.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.240
I don't move
because of you.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.080
A woman has to choose
for herself, Bess.

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.960
She has to have
a mind of her own.

01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:48.045
Now, what you're doing is making
things worse. it's nonsense.

01:39:48.045 --> 01:39:49.446
His head's full of scars.

01:39:49.446 --> 01:39:50.805
He's up to his eyeballs in drugs.

01:39:50.805 --> 01:39:51.821
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

01:39:54.446 --> 01:39:56.320
And he doesn't know.

01:40:00.729 --> 01:40:01.689
I'm sorry.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.920
I'm sorry.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.400
Am I going to go to hell?

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:17.120
Whom do you want to save...
yourself or Jan?

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.560
Bess.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.320
It's been a long time...
most unlike you.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.080
I must warn you that
the Lord looks with anger...

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.240
...upon those who fail him.

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.920
You've got to lend me
something to wear.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.200
A good shot.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.760
All right.
All right.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.880
Hello.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.640
Good shot.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.400
How much, darling?

01:42:02.188 --> 01:42:04.568
1, 2, 3, up.

01:42:04.778 --> 01:42:07.036
Ok. Good.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.280
Thank you.

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.560
I can't hear the blood pressure.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.480
The blood pressure.

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.640
We have a fibrillation.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.560
Clear.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.480
Still no change.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.120
Ok. Clear.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.880
Clear again, please.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.080
Go on.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.960
Clear, please.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.360
Yes!

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.320
Oh, yes!

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.760
All right.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.600
Good work.
Good work.

01:43:10.981 --> 01:43:12.901
It's ok?

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.120
Hi, Bess.

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.960
Bess...

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.280
Bess, I think it's time
we had a little chat.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.400
I love you no matter
what is in your head.

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.040
So you didn't
have to give Jan...

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.960
...electric shock treatment
when his heart stopped...

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.400
...in the operation yesterday?

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.840
No, we didn't.

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.240
It was a perfectly
simple operation.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.640
As you know. Well,

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.360
I shouldn't have to say that.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.800
You know that very well.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.480
I want a word with
Bess on her own.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.440
Thank you, Dorothy.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.240
I'm not going to ask you
what you've been getting up to...

01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.640
...because I don't want
to hear you lie to me,...

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:57.000
...but as long as you are
living under my roof,...

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.360
...you are to behave
like a decent human being.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.760
I have never lied to you.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:04.800
Do you understand me?

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.080
Yes, mother.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.320
This is very painful for me.

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.720
Your grandfather can no longer

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.600
Hold his hand over you
with the elders.

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.480
I don't think you realize
what that means.

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.800
Have you any idea
what it's like to be cast out?

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.160
You will have nothing, Bess.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:34.560
I've known strong men and women...

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.000
...wither away
after being cast out.

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:42.240
Now, you are not strong.
You're a feeble girl.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.640
It would kill you, Bess.

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.520
I've said enough.

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.680
Bess. Bess.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.560
Can you come down
a minute, love?

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.840
Dr. Richardson is here.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.720
Hi, Bess.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.080
Hello.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.560
How are you?
Can we sit down?

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.080
Uh-huh.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.280
Bess...

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.080
I think...I think
you've got yourself...

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.520
...involved in something...

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.960
...which is
out of your control.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.800
Have I?

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.640
Come on, Bess.

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.040
You're not a kid anymore.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.960
Look, for Christ's sake,...

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.400
...he's forcing you
to get screwed...

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.320
...by every Tom,
Dick, and Harry.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.240
It's just not you.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.960
I don't make love with them.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.800
I make love with Jan...

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.640
...and I save him
from dying.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.840
Well, I'm sorry,
but you know,

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.760
To me, he seems more
like a dirty old man...

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.680
...who wants to play
the peeping Tom.

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.920
Sometimes...

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.800
I don't even have
to tell him about it.

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.560
Jan and me...

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.440
We have a spiritual contact.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.480
God gives everyone
something to be good at.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.280
I've always been stupid...

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.080
But I'm good at this.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.760
God gives everyone a talent.

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.480
And what's Jan's talent?

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.160
He is...

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.880
He's a great lover.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.720
Well, what's...
what's mine, then?

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.080
I don't know.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.000
Haven't you found it yet?

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.840
I see.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.120
And what's your talent,
then, Bess? Because, um...

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.040
Oh, surely it can't
be being screwed...

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.960
...by men you've never seen before.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.280
I can believe.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.880
Are you angry now?

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.320
Yes, I am!

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm angry...

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.680
...because you can't see that
he's messing you about.

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.120
He's the one who's sick.

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.520
Look, what he's doing
to you is sick,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.440
and it's getting
sicker and sicker.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.360
He's becoming more
and more of a danger to you

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.760
the more the fluid
rises in his...

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.680
...listen to me,
for god's sake!

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:37.080
Do you always get so involved...

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.960
...in your patients'
problems, Dr. Richardson?

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.360
Listen to me, Bess.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.280
I care for you.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.400
I love you, Bess.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.720
You're very special.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.840
Will you move
your hands, please?

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.280
Certainly.

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:15.960
Dodo.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.680
Will you show
Dr. Richardson out, please?

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.600
W...what's going to
happen now, Bess?

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.520
Um, has he told you any more...

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.960
...of the thoughts he's had?

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:30.360
Any more services
for you to perform?

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.280
Don't come here again.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.200
Oh, he has, has he? And what's
it going to be this time?

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.120
What are you going to give him
to slobber over this time?

01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:01.280
Dear father, what's going on?

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.640
Father, where are you?

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.840
That boy scared me.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.480
Hello.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.760
Can you take me
out to the ships?

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.480
Can't take you out there.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.880
The other girls
wouldn't like it.

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.000
But they can't
do all the ships.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.440
They don't have time.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.240
Maybe not.

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.440
What about the big one?

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.840
I don't go out
to that one anymore.

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.960
Girls won't go aboard.

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.800
Well, then you can
take me. No harm done.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.960
How are you feeling, Jan?

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:09.800
Well, I've felt better.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:13.160
Yeah. Yeah.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:14.600
Unfortunately, the periods...

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.480
...in which we can
get through to you...

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.400
...have lately
become very rare.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.840
I'll have to send you
back to Glasgow...

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.760
...for a while, I'm afraid.

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.840
I don't want any more...

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:29.240
...operations.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.640
Of course,
it's entirely up to you,...

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.560
...but...

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:36.440
I have to say that your
condition's unlikely to improve...

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.840
...without surgery.

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.840
Well, if you've made
your mind up on that point,

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.200
Um, maybe it's time
to consider other matters.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:59.600
I mean, we should start thinking
about other people than just you.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.400
Bess.

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:09.680
I'm glad you understand
what I'm driving at.

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:16.880
Your...your condition's been-
it's been very hard on her.

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:22.160
And I can't judge why,
but she's suffering...

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.520
...from delusions
regarding your condition.

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.840
I have to be blunt.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.200
I don't think that
seeing you is good for her.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.560
I guess not.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.960
I am convinced
that the best thing

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.880
...we can do for her right now...

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.760
is to admit her again.

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.600
Get her away?

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.040
Yes.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.400
As far away as possible.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.720
Think that's necessary?

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.560
Listen, if you
don't want surgery,

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.440
...the indications are that we
will enter a prolonged period...

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.320
...in which you will be more and
more affected by your condition.

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:17.000
The poorlier you are, the more
detrimental your influence on Bess.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.840
I've drawn up some papers giving
me the authority to detain her...

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:23.720
...under the provisions
of the mental health act.

01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:28.520
I'll need your consent.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.400
You're going to section Bess?

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.800
It's the only way
I can get her treated.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.400
Tell me, Dr. Richardson, does...

01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:59.720
...does this mean I will
never see her again?

01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.040
To be realistic, yes.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.320
It's just there at the bottom.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.280
You said you wanted to help her.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.080
Come on, Jan.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:49.640
<i>If you've been bad</i>

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.000
<i>Lord, I bet you have</i>

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:57.800
<i>And you've not been hit</i>

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.680
<i>You've not been hit
by flying lead</i>

01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:05.480
<i>You'd better
close your eyes</i>

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.320
<i>You'd better
bow your head</i>

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:17.480
<i>Wait for the ricochet</i>

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.320
<i>Ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.160
<i>Ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.760
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.920
How do I get back?

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:15.320
I'll keep an eye out for you.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.040
Hello.

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:51.320
What do you want?

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:01.400
I want that you do it
with the sailor and I watch.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.240
Ok.

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.360
It's all right.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.600
It's ok.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.520
All right.
Come here, you.

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:23.480
No!

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:26.720
There we go, eh?

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.040
Yeah. That's better.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.760
Come on down.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.640
Yeah.

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:40.040
You like it like this, eh?

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:42.440
Oh, please.
can I go home now?

01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.360
No. No. Can I
go home now?

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.320
Please, I don't want...
Stay still.

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.760
No. Please.

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.720
No. No. Please.
Please.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.640
Stay still, I said.

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.080
Stay still, I said.

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.880
Stay still, I said.

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:01.520
No.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.440
Aah!

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:05.840
Bitch!

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:09.680
I'm going to shoot you.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:11.120
You will, huh?

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.560
I'm going to shoot you.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.480
You think so?

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:16.880
You don't even know
how to use that thing.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:27.320
Nobody will believe a hooker!

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.760
Because there is
only one thing for us,...

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:39.680
...sinners that we are,...

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:43.520
...to achieve perfection
in the eyes of God...

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.840
...through unconditional love...

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:51.200
...for the word that is written,...

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:55.040
...through unconditional love
for the law.

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.120
I don't understand
what you're saying.

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.400
How can you love a word?

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:16.520
Love words.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:20.120
You cannot be
in love with a word.

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.880
You can love
another human being.

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:31.160
That's perfection.

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.600
No woman speaks here.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.880
Bess McNeill,
the kirk session...

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.000
...has decided this day
that henceforth,...

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.880
...you shall no longer
have access to this kirk.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.280
They who know you
shall not know you.

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.720
Please, let me stay!
Please!

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.800
Begone, Bess McNeill,
from the house of God.

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.040
Hello, Bess.

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:14.960
You're...you're coming with us.

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.400
We're going to Glasgow.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.840
Bess, they're
going to take you...

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.280
...back into hospital
just for a little bit.

02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.200
It's for your own good.

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.560
I want to see Jan.
I want to see my husband.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.000
I know, but not now, Bess.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:28.880
It's for your own good, Bess.

02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:30.800
Mother can't have me admitted.

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.240
Not now that I'm married.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:36.080
Bess, it wasn't mother
that signed the paper.

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.000
It was Jan.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.400
You liar!

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.320
Come along, Bess.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.760
Jan!

02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:46.160
Jan!

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.040
Dodo, how can you do this?

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.440
You had a husband, too, once.

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:54.800
Your love could have saved him,
if only you'd tried!

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.240
Jan!

02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.360
Jan!

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:34.320
Ok, Bess. let's go.

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:37.200
Oh, fuck!

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.600
Ryan, she's not here!

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.040
Hello.

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.800
Who's a tart?

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.440
What are you doing?

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:28.800
Who's a tart?

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:29.760
Who's a tart?

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.960
Tart! Tart!

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:44.280
I can't open the door.

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.680
Mother?

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:54.360
Please. Please, mother,
open the door!

02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:58.680
Please, open the door!

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:03.960
Mother!

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.800
I'll be good.
I'll be really, really good.

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:11.640
I'll be really good.
Oh, please, open.

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.000
Please go away.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.800
Stop it! Go away.

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:40.800
You just go away
and leave me!

02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.040
Who's a tart?

02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.640
Away with you.

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.520
Stop all this racket
outside the house of God.

02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.360
Come on! On you go.

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:11.080
What's happened?

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.480
Bess.

02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.400
Bess!

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:18.280
Bess, are you all right, love?

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.160
Bess, it's Dodo.

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:23.080
Oh, Bessie.

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.320
Jan is dying.

02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:46.600
I...I wasn't to tell you.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.280
I wasn't to tell you.

02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:58.120
No. It's good you told me.

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.680
I know you love me.

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.600
I have to go.

02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.360
Is there anything
I can do for you?

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.800
Anything at all?

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:37.000
Yes.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.920
I'd like you to go to Jan...

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:40.360
...to be curedr him

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.760
and to rise from his bed
and walk.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.400
Will you take me
to the big ship?

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:10.840
Again?

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.280
Are you sure?

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.200
Father, why aren't
you with me?

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.240
I am with you, Bess.
What do you want from me?

02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.480
Where were you?

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:50.800
Oh, don't you think
I have other people...

02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:52.240
...who want to talk to me?

02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:57.040
Well, of course.
I hadn't thought of that.

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:01.360
There's this silly
little thing called Bess...

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.280
...who keeps on wanting me
to talk to her,...

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.120
...so my work's been
piling up a bit.

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.440
But you're with me now?

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.680
Of course I am, Bess.
you know that.

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.720
Thank you.

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.240
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you need me?

02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.640
No. That's all right.
Stay there.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.960
Bess asked me to pray.

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:16.880
For what?

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.320
For Jan's life.

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:23.600
For a miracle.

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.880
Yeah. That would be a miracle.

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.240
Dear God,

02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:43.880
I pray that Jan gets better,

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.680
That he rises
from his bed and walks.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.640
Sister McNeill here.

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:06.200
We'll make you better.

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.600
Where's Jan?
I'd like to see him.

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.040
No. Not now, love.

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:11.480
You're going to have
an operation now.

02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:12.920
I want to see him.

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.360
Not now, love.
You need an operation.

02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:17.240
No. I've got to see Jan.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.640
Please, Dodo.

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:21.320
All right.

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:23.240
All right. Stop.
She wants to see Jan.

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:25.160
I'm going to take her to see Jan.

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:27.560
Come on. Out of the way,
for God's sake.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.440
Help me. Come on.

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.840
Move, for Christ's sake!

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.720
All right. All right.

02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:38.600
There you go.
There you are.

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:40.520
You can see him now,
can't you?

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.440
How is he...

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.800
How's he doing?

02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:52.640
Is he not any better?

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.040
No. No, he's not.

02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.320
Oh. I thought he
might be better now.

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.120
Hmm.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.480
Maybe I was wrong
after all.

02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.240
Ok, let's get inside.

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.040
Here. Take those.

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.000
Tape.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.800
Ok, take care. Let's go.
1, 2, 3.

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:26.720
There we go.

02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.840
It's all right, love.

02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:37.280
Now, Bess,
do you know me?

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:38.240
Yeah.

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:39.680
Pulse 90.

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.400
What happened?
Do you know?

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.360
No.

02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.240
Pressure on 100.

02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:51.200
Get the blood pressure.

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:52.640
100.

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:53.600
It will be all right, love.

02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:55.040
It will be all right.

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.360
Can I have a look at her back?

02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:58.280
There we go.

02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.200
Ok. Hand me the scissors.

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:01.160
Yes.

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:02.120
All right.

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.040
Mother.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.440
Oh, mother.

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:09.320
Here she is.

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:13.640
Bessie.

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:15.560
Bess.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.680
I'm sorry that I
could not be good, mother.

02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:21.080
That's all right, Bessie.

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.240
Your grandfather's
sorry he couldn't come.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.960
Will you tell him
that I love him?

02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.280
I am glad that you
came, mother.

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.120
Blood pressure.

02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:49.040
It will be all right.

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.480
It's going down.

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.920
2 units now.
2 units immediately.

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:53.360
2 units.

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.800
Ok, we're just going
to lower you down

02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.200
a little bit now,
all right, Bess?

02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.120
There we go.

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:00.200
That was easy, wasn't it?

02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:01.880
Going to be all right.

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:06.680
Oh. Oh.
Dodo, hold me.

02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:08.600
Here I am. I'm holding.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.520
It's all right, love.
I'm here. I'm here.

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.440
I'm afraid.

02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.840
I know. I know.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:18.560
Jan?

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.400
Jan!

02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.800
Shh. Now, shh.

02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:27.200
I'm frightened.

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:32.480
It's...
It's all wrong.

02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:35.840
No pulse.

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:36.800
Bess?

02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.240
Stand clear.
Stand clear!

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:40.040
Clear. Clear.

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:41.720
What?

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.600
It's going to be all right.

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.040
That's a good girl.
Come on.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.600
Ok. You can stop now.

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.040
What? What?
What do you mean?

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:08.480
She's gone, Dodo.
She's gone.

02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:14.240
No.

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:15.680
She's gone.

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.440
Bess. Bess.
listen to me.

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.720
I'm sorry.

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:34.879
Dodo.

02:16:36.799 --> 02:16:40.160
No!

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:42.080
Come on, Dodo.
let's go!

02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:44.480
Come on.

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.240
I'm sorry!

02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.959
<i>It's a little bit funny...</i>

02:17:00.959 --> 02:17:04.799
<i>...this feeling inside</i>

02:17:04.799 --> 02:17:08.160
<i>I'm not one of those who can...</i>

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:12.000
<i>...easily hide</i>

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.400
<i>Don't have much money...</i>

02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.719
<i>...but, boy, if I did</i>

02:17:18.719 --> 02:17:22.080
<i>I'd buy a big house where...</i>

02:17:22.559 --> 02:17:25.440
<i>...we both could live</i>

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.719
<i>if I was a sculptor...</i>

02:17:30.719 --> 02:17:34.080
<i>...but then again no</i>

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.879
<i>Or a man who makes potions in the...</i>

02:17:38.879 --> 02:17:42.240
<i>...traveling show</i>

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.160
<i>I know it's not much...</i>

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:49.440
<i>...but it's the best
I can do</i>

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:52.799
<i>My gift is my song, and...</i>

02:17:52.799 --> 02:17:55.200
<i>...this one's for you</i>

02:17:58.559 --> 02:18:01.920
<i>And you can tell everybody...</i>

02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:05.280
<i>...this is your song</i>

02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:09.600
<i>it may be quite simple, but...</i>

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.040
<i>...now that it's done...</i>

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.799
You describe the deceased as
"an immature, unstable person,...

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:20.639
...a person who, due to the
trauma of her husband's illness,...

02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.040
...gave way
in obsessive fashion...

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:27.360
...to an exaggerated,
perverse form of sexuality."

02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:33.120
Would you like to clarify
that to the inquiry?

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.040
That's what I wrote.

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:41.760
Yes. That's what it says.

02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:45.600
Can I have a glass
of water, please?

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:48.959
Get Dr. Richardson
a glass of water.

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.719
Thank you.

02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:00.959
Listen, man, you had
the deceased in your care.

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:04.680
The court would like
to hear the medical facts.

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.400
If...If you'd, um,
if you were to ask me again...

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:16.680
...to write... um...
the conclusion, then...

02:19:19.559 --> 02:19:21.959
...instead of writing
"neurotic"...

02:19:21.959 --> 02:19:26.280
...or, um, "psychotic,"
then I might...

02:19:27.719 --> 02:19:30.600
...just, um,
use a word like...

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.920
"Good."

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.200
Good?

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.120
Yes.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.840
You wish the records of this court...

02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:52.680
...to state that
in your medical opinion,...

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:55.560
...the deceased was suffering
from being "good"?

02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:02.280
Perhaps this was
the psychological defect...

02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.200
...that led to her death.

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.520
Is that what we shall
write, Dr. Richardson?

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.280
No.

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.200
Of course not.

02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:20.040
Very well, then.

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:24.360
Perhaps we should stick to your
original statement then, doctor.

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:25.800
Yes.

02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:31.920
I think that everything
there is to say...

02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:34.800
...about Bess McNeill
has been said already.

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:38.640
We have agreed
to sanction her burial,...

02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:42.480
...but there can be
no funeral service.

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:45.720
The fact that some of us
knew the deceased girl well...

02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:51.960
...cannot be allowed to
influence the form of her burial.

02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:54.840
Bess McNeill's funeral
must be the same...

02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:58.200
...as anyone else of her kind.

02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:02.520
The body will be released by
the authorities sometime this week.

02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.520
I've obtained permission from
the elders to bury Bess...

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:16.200
but...I cannot deviate from the principles
that apply to funerals here.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:21.840
I must say about Bess
what must be said.

02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:57.680
Ok. Come on.

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:27.080
Where's Jan?
has he gone down there yet?

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:29.000
I don't know.

02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:35.840
Have you seen Jan?

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:05.480
Bess McNeill, you are a sinner,...

02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:09.800
...and for your sins,
you are consigned to hell.

02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:15.080
Not one of you has the right...

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:17.480
...to consign Bess to hell.

02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:08.720
Terry, it's time.

02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:15.920
Let's do it.

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:22.640
Get up, for Christ's sake.

02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:13.640
Come on, man.

02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:19.400
Come on.

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.280
Take good care of her.

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.960
Come on, Jan.
you got to let her go.

02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:40.280
Bess!

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:45.800
Jan.

02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.240
Jan, hey.

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:48.680
What?
What's the matter?

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:49.640
Come on.
Come on.

02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:51.080
I want to show you something.

02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:53.000
You're not going to believe it.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:53.960
What?

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:54.920
Come on.

02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:56.360
Please.

02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:57.800
Here. Let's go.

02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.680
Pim! Pim, come on!

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:02.600
You're not going to believe it.

02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.960
Ha Ha Ha!

02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:08.360
Hey, Pim, Come on.
Check this out.

02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:13.640
Check this thing out, man.

02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.040
You see anything?

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:17.960
There's nothing out there.

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.880
I've tried all
the fucking ranges,...

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:21.800
...and there's nothing there.

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:23.240
I just wanted
to be sure. Come on.
