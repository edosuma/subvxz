00:02.070 --> 00:04.038

00:04.072 --> 00:06.207
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
You're listening to WNZ.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.077
It's a beautiful day
in New York today.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.080
Temperatures expected
to reach the mid-60s.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.083
62 in Greenpoint,
68 at the beaches.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.084
And now, back to...

00:16.117 --> 00:17.418
MIKE:
Finch...

00:17.451 --> 00:19.220
Finch?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.554
Ike!

00:20.588 --> 00:22.090
IKE:
What's wrong?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.092
MIKE:
It's Finch, look at him.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.094
IKE:
Finch?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.096
MIKE:
He doesn't have a fever,

00:28.129 --> 00:30.598
but he says his stomach hurts
and he's seeing spots.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.600
What's the
matter, Finch?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.568
Ike.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.137
Is that you?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.307
I... I can't
see that far.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.210
Feel his hands.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.612
They're cold
and clammy.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.580
No way I'm feeling
his hands.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.084
We'll tell the office
you're sick.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.754
If you need
anything, call.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.123
Okay?

00:55.156 --> 00:57.491
Ringy-dingy.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.366
(door opens, closes)

01:05.399 --> 01:06.700
(sighs)

01:06.734 --> 01:08.236
They bought it.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.438
*

01:17.845 --> 01:19.147
Incredible.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.814
A wildly substandard
performance,

01:20.848 --> 01:23.117
and they never doubted it
for an instant.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.220
*

01:26.254 --> 01:29.590
How could I be expected to
handle work on a day like this?

01:29.623 --> 01:34.262
To have a truly epic day off,
you're gonna want your own NZT.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.264
Thanks to my friend
in the senate,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.267
I've got five
of my very own pills.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.602
Of course, you have
to keep them hidden.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.137
And the key
to a good hiding place

01:43.171 --> 01:45.139
is finding a place
no one would want to look.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.607
Something with the right
combination

01:46.640 --> 01:49.143
of skeletons and naked people
usually does the trick.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.612
Now, a lot of people will say
you should stash your pills

01:51.645 --> 01:53.614
in a prescription bottle
that you've already got,

01:53.647 --> 01:55.283
but the government's
thinking pills already,

01:55.316 --> 01:57.618
and if they look in there,
you could wind up in prison.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.287
That's worse than work.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.621
Stick to your album covers.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.224
Then if you want
to take one with you,

02:03.257 --> 02:06.694
you just tuck it right in here.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.363
Now, we used to call that
the condom pocket.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.699
That's a little
childish and stupid,

02:11.732 --> 02:13.734
but, then again,
so was high school.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.239
Life goes by really fast.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.275
If you don't stop to look around
sometimes, you could miss it.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.346
Of course, it'd be a lot more
fun if Rebecca could come,

02:25.379 --> 02:28.482
but I can't really tell her
that I got my own supply of NZT.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.851
*

02:35.523 --> 02:38.492
But, still, I could use
the company.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.361
I'm gonna have fun today.

02:40.394 --> 02:44.365
I quote John Lennon, "A dream
you dream alone is only a dream.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.501
A dream you dream together
is reality."

02:47.535 --> 02:50.338
After all, he was the walrus.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.206
I could be the walrus.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.208
Wouldn't change the fact
that the FBI owns this place

02:54.242 --> 02:55.676
and pretty much watches
my every move.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.378
(door opens)

03:00.548 --> 03:02.616
(Taser crackles)
Oh, that's not how it goes.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.623
Hi. Dean Merrick.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.825
Thanks for making
the time to see me.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.993
Please.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.363
It's always nice to sit down
with some fellow travelers.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.898
Mm-hmm. You said you were
with an intelligence agency?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.967
We're not supposed
to say the name,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.669
you know how it is, but
we all know the deal.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.671
A certain agency with
a certain headquarters

03:23.704 --> 03:25.439
in Langley, Virginia.
Ah,

03:25.473 --> 03:27.308
and why have our friends
in Virginia asked

03:27.341 --> 03:28.709
to see the three of us?

03:28.742 --> 03:29.943
Came to talk to you
about Brian Finch.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.313
What do you know
about Brian Finch?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.282
Unique asset.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.350
Well-fortified with
vitamins and minerals.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.286
Guys.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.288
It's one big team,
we share information.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.355
A few of us know
about the pills,

03:41.389 --> 03:42.623
a few of us know
about Finch.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.359
I never told the CIA
about Brian Finch.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.395
Look, this is a friendly visit.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.263
We support what
you're doing.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.299
In fact, we want to share
in the benefits of it.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.301
We're staging an
operation next few days.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.003
The details are...
classified.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.471
But it matters to the
people who matter.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.273
We want to stack the
deck for success.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.542
We'd like to borrow
your guy for a spell.

04:01.575 --> 04:05.546
Well, I wish you had led with
this request, Mr. Merrick.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.448
You could have saved
us all some time.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.449
No.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.318
I hear you, I do.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.321
But let me assure you, he'll be
kept strictly out of harm's way.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.588
We'll monitor his
access to those pills,

04:14.622 --> 04:17.725
and I should say this request
has been vetted from on high.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.461
This department is
responsible for Brian Finch,

04:20.494 --> 04:22.696
and there is no way
I am releasing him.
Hey,

04:22.730 --> 04:24.031
I get it, I do.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.799
People on my side go over
my head all the time.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.701
Nice to meet you.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.470
Just so you know.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.605
My people are very good
at what they do.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.441
You'll have your boy back
in no more than two days.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.943
You're not making
a request.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.478
Where's Brian?

04:37.511 --> 04:40.748
We sincerely appreciate
your cooperation.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.317
Where the hell is Brian?

04:43.351 --> 04:45.353
(water splashes)

04:52.460 --> 04:53.927
MAN:
Finch.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.298
Back to the land of the living.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.572
Hey.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.440
Where am I?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.908
You're a long way
from just about anywhere.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.378
Sorry about the...
(imitates Taser crackle)

05:10.411 --> 05:11.545
I don't like
to be theatrical,

05:11.579 --> 05:13.647
but they said we couldn't tell
you where we're taking you.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.848
What do you want?

05:14.882 --> 05:17.017
We're not kidnapping you.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.653
You're working
with us.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.021
Welcome to your
first black op.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.785
Let's get on the same page.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.755
They wouldn't tell us
much about you.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.756
But we do-- we understand

05:55.789 --> 05:59.960
that basically... you are
a science experiment.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.731
The government has you on some
next-level neuro enhancers,

06:03.764 --> 06:07.635
which makes you crazy-good
at solving problems.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.838
That sound about right?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.640
MAN 2:
Hey, man.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.974
Cool apartment.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.643
That's our comm guy.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.777
Our translator
doesn't speak much,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.579
but he's damn
good at his job.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.717
So, what, are you
guys the Army?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.819
We've been in armies.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.954
You got names?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.489
Yes.

06:28.522 --> 06:32.760
But it's best that you don't
have that information.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.764
If you end up testifying
against this thing, trust me,

06:36.797 --> 06:39.767
lack of information will
be your best friend.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.437
Did you say "testifying"?

06:43.471 --> 06:44.872
What exactly are we
doing out here?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.107
You, Mr. Problem Solver,
are gonna help us

06:47.140 --> 06:50.844
zero in on this nasty guy that's
hiding out in these woods.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.746
Aleksey Basayev?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.882
He joined some jihadi-inclined
group in Chechnya,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.550
snuck into the States
two weeks ago.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.553
Couple days ago,
he slipped surveillance,

06:59.587 --> 07:01.021
and he's holed up
somewhere out here.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.091
If he gets by us, he will
kill people on U.S. soil.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.764
Feel free to carry a
box on your next trip.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.766
No. No way, man.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.934
Look, you tased me.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.102
You threw me
in the back of a...

07:15.135 --> 07:16.036
What is this,
a rubber dinghy?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.138
How am I supposed
to believe any of this?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.941
That's a fair question.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.944
Got a permission slip
from the Bureau.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.046
Also have orders to
bring you home okay.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.583
I've also got
two of these.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.953
Now, your country needs you
to help keep it safe, Brian.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.989
What do you say?

07:42.530 --> 07:44.532
Supposed to be my day off.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.738
We were somewhere
in Pennsylvania.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.205
The Allegheny
Islands Wilderness.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.741
I could tell that much

07:53.774 --> 07:55.208
from the satellite pictures
they gave me.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.810
There's nowhere to go.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.278
I'm days from the edge
of the woods.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.682
The best way out of here
is to help them find this guy--

08:01.715 --> 08:03.851
Aleksey Basayev.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.853
Your basic action hero.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.855
Fought for the Russians
in the Chechen War.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.791
He spent an entire winter
in the Caucasus Mountains.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.527
As far as when he became
a terrorist, it didn't say.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.696
He married a Chechen woman
after the war.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.999
After that, everything
was... redacted.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.735
Saw it so many times, I
couldn't help but get curious.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.203
Don't worry so much
about what Basayev did.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.805
You need to worry
about where he is.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.073
I think I know that already.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.340
Basayev is a
survivalist.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.711
He needs three things to stay
alive: food, water and shelter.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.912
That's quite an insight.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.180
(chuckles)

08:33.213 --> 08:34.114
Hmm.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.749
I looked at every
satellite photo we have,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.217
and I found 15 different
places in these woods

08:37.250 --> 08:38.586
that have easy
access to a stream,

08:38.619 --> 08:41.922
caves for shelter,
and wildlife to hunt.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.793
Here... there's
a herd of deer

08:45.826 --> 08:48.261
that drink from that
stream every day.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.799
And here's a photo
from yesterday.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.833
I see deer.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.867
How many deer?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.704
There were seven deer
in that herd.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.171
The same group drinks
from that stream every day.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.007
But yesterday...

09:00.040 --> 09:01.008
One is missing.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.843
Means Basayev is hunting.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.344
12 klicks
northeast of here.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.579
Good job.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.816
Damn, man.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.184
What's in those pills?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.186
NAZ: No. No, no,
no, that's not...

09:13.220 --> 09:15.222
(berating indistinctly)

09:21.061 --> 09:22.362
BOYLE:
Hey.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.665
You get anywhere
with your Agency contacts?

09:24.698 --> 09:25.766
Uh-uh.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.768
Okay, I served with a guy
in the Rangers, he went CIA

09:27.801 --> 09:30.103
when we got back from the
Sandbox-- I'll talk to him.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.374
She's pissed, huh?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.611
Or she's putting on a good show.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.379
NAZ:
Don't act like
you have to go.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.615
Son of a bitch.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.221
Somebody put a signature
down authorizing this,

09:48.255 --> 09:49.389
but no one will
own up to it.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.159
The deputy director "hopes"
he'll be back in three days.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.194
Brian's not a soldier.
We're gonna find Brian.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.364
Once that's done,

09:57.397 --> 10:00.200
I'm gonna figure out who
the hell authorized this,

10:00.233 --> 10:02.736
and either that person will
no longer work for the Bureau

10:02.770 --> 10:05.172
or I won't.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.841
What, are you wondering
if I knew about this?

10:07.875 --> 10:11.411
Rebecca, I would never send
Brian on a military mission.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.380
Now, I hate to do
what I'm gonna do,

10:13.413 --> 10:16.049
but they've left
me no choice.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.384
This is a file

10:17.417 --> 10:19.386
from the last time we
collaborated with the CIA.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.789
I'm circling six names.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.723
Names of whom?

10:22.756 --> 10:25.358
You'll figure it out.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.894
If I pass you
this piece of paper,

10:26.927 --> 10:28.862
we could both wind up
in front of a subcommittee.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.868
BRIAN:
This is supposed to be
the perfect day off.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.706
And instead
I've walked 12 miles.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.741
I haven't spent
this much time in a woods

10:40.774 --> 10:41.742
since summer camp.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.776
(retching)

10:42.810 --> 10:43.877
You ate these?

10:43.911 --> 10:46.880
These are pokeweed, you idiot.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.984
One of the older kids told me
they'd give me hallucinations.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.886
They made me copy out a chapter
about poisonous plants

10:52.920 --> 10:57.224
by hand while I sat
in the nurse's office.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.992
Mercenaries or contractors
or whatever these guys were,

10:59.026 --> 11:01.128
they're terrible company.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.462
Hours together in the woods,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.698
and even on NZT,
I still don't know

11:04.732 --> 11:06.900
anything useful
about any of them.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.368
They wouldn't
tell me their names,

11:08.401 --> 11:10.771
so I gave them nicknames
to keep track of them.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.206
Guy in charge--
he's Rooney, obviously.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.910
Nine times.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.947
Nice guy, but people tell him
what to do-- Cameron.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.483
The one who never
says anything,

11:23.516 --> 11:25.018
that's Abe Froman,

11:25.052 --> 11:27.254
Sausage King of Chicago.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.222
I had blisters all over my feet
by the end of the day,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.458
but something tells me
that complaining to these guys

11:31.491 --> 11:33.060
would be a bad idea.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.831
That's his spot.

11:38.932 --> 11:39.499
How can you tell?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.134
Look at the deer.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.911
Don't see Basayev.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.379
He'll be back.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.347
Waiting on him
to fall asleep anyway.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.415
Finch, come here.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.853
How much happy do you have left
in your happy pill?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.889
Not much.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.791
Couple hours, tops.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.458
It's gonna get quiet
when we prep.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.527
When we move on that structure,
I want you to take it.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.963
The FBI only gives me one a day.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.432
Yeah, I'm sure the FBI has
an extensive list of rules

12:12.465 --> 12:13.801
and regulations.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.903
I want you at your best.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.120
Want to see?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.494
See, those pills,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.897
they told us
you were the only one

12:43.931 --> 12:46.033
who could take them safely.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.935
Why is that?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.238
They have side effects.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.140
Yeah, you take a few of them,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.008
and they get really, really bad.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.812
That doesn't happen to me.

12:58.846 --> 12:59.880
For some reason.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.149
And the FBI wants to know why.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.550
Gotcha.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.920
Then dumb grunts like me
can get souped up like you.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.421
(laughs)

13:08.455 --> 13:09.890
What's it like?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.191
Being that smart?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.193
Understand you're
talking to a guy

13:13.226 --> 13:14.561
who couldn't get into OCS.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.897
Dude, I got kicked out
of five schools.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.199
Yeah, my parents
used to look at me

13:19.232 --> 13:20.934
like I was some sort of clown.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.569
(laughs)
I mean,

13:22.602 --> 13:24.571
it's complicated.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.939
But those pills?

13:27.607 --> 13:28.842
They're amazing.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.277
Ow!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.411
Why'd you kick me?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.546
(Rooney shushes)

13:33.580 --> 13:36.016
We have an ex-Spetsnaz
out there, walking around.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.051
No chatter, got it?

13:42.422 --> 13:43.456
Captain Crossfit!
(laughs)

13:43.490 --> 13:45.425
I got to stop with the donuts.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.927
No!
Mike Timms.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.096
Rebecca Harris.
What can I do
for you guys?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.998
Well, we're in
a tricky situation, Mike.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.966
CIA hijacked one of our assets,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.968
a kid named Brian Finch.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.870
We need to know what's going on.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.638
And you're asking me?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.473
We do market research here.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.509
Yeah, well, as you
and many of the other people

14:02.542 --> 14:05.012
who carry badges
around this city know,

14:05.045 --> 14:08.115
this place is a data-mining
station for the CIA.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.118
Kid is important to me.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.020
We served together, Mike.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.288
Anything you can
tell us.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.924
Can't help you, brother.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.026
Well, I'm sincerely sorry
to hear that.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.528
I have a list
of six names.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.231
Clandestine CIA operatives
positioned all over the world.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.366
And if I don't know
where Brian is in one hour,

14:26.399 --> 14:28.001
I'm gonna leak them.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.536
You realize
that's a serious crime

14:29.569 --> 14:31.004
and that people could di...?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.239
Use that hour to get
your men to safety.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.074
And if you want to talk crimes,
I'll see yours

14:34.107 --> 14:37.310
and I'll raise you-- the CIA has
no mandate to work on U.S. soil.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.647
One hour or your guys
are burned for good.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.250
Boyle's contact

14:43.283 --> 14:45.185
told us the CIA
put three contractors

14:45.218 --> 14:46.586
on active payroll last week.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.488
They all flew
into Pennsylvania.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.157
And based on the time
and locale,

14:50.190 --> 14:51.191
it's reasonable to assume

14:51.224 --> 14:53.260
that this is the team
that Brian is working with.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.029
John Kellerman is former Delta.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.364
Kyle Hollinger was in the Navy.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.631
Failed his OCS test twice.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.100
Washed out of SEAL training
a few times.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.635
And there's this guy.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.972
Miklos Petrov--
he was in the Polish Army,

15:05.005 --> 15:07.440
but he was discharged
after some atrocity in Iraq.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.142
After that, he was
a lead interrogator

15:09.176 --> 15:12.112
at a CIA black site
outside of Warsaw.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.182
So, this man is out there
with Brian on a mission

15:15.215 --> 15:16.683
that has essentially
no oversight.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.651
My contact at the CIA
didn't know the details

15:18.685 --> 15:20.087
of this mission but told me

15:20.120 --> 15:21.588
there was another member
of this black ops team

15:21.621 --> 15:23.690
the past few times
they headed out.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.392
Carla Paz--
she's a helicopter pilot.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.594
Ferries rich guys
around Manhattan now.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.963
Look, I don't care
how you get her talking.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.100
Find out everything
she knows about that unit.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.301
(crickets chirping)

15:34.334 --> 15:36.970
BRIAN:
Nightfall means

15:37.004 --> 15:38.105
I get another pill
and Rooney and his crew

15:38.138 --> 15:40.373
make their move.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.770
(door creaks)

16:10.803 --> 16:13.006
CAMERON:
Contact with Basayev!

16:19.179 --> 16:21.248
Target is on the move!
He's in the open!

16:21.281 --> 16:22.315
ROONEY:
Moving in to check it out.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.650
Man down!

16:23.683 --> 16:25.152
We got a man down!

16:36.196 --> 16:38.398
(buzzing)

16:38.431 --> 16:40.167
Zip-tie him.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.636
I'm gonna check
on my translator.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.672
Make sure
he's alive.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.143
(birds chirping)

16:56.183 --> 16:58.251
(speaking Russian)

17:05.125 --> 17:08.395
Hey, you handled
yourself well, kid.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.164
Let me know if you ever get
tired, bored of your desk job.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.465
So, what happens now?

17:12.499 --> 17:15.202
We just wait for a helicopter?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.704
Soon, though, we're gonna
talk to him for a while.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.606
Can't you just do that
when he's in jail?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.741
No, tactically this is
a much better environment

17:21.774 --> 17:24.344
to get to the straight talk.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.313
You did your thing, kid.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.515
Brought down a
really bad guy.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.450
Now, let us do our thing.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.124
I still want to know
what this guy did.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.758
They didn't seem to care
too much that I was around.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.293
I'm guessing no one
told them that the FBI

17:40.327 --> 17:42.295
made me study Russian
while I was on NZT.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.797
I had the basics down.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.478
I didn't say I was fluent.

17:58.511 --> 18:02.182
But the more they talked,
the more dialed-in I got.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.797
Huh? Maybe I'm missing
something in the translation.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.642
No, they're gonna kill him.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.721
So, you know that's
definitely not a bluff, right?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.591
They're not out here
to arrest that guy.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.792
If they were,

18:45.825 --> 18:46.859
there would be
all kinds of helicopters

18:46.893 --> 18:48.895
and commando teams.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.430
No, they're out here
to execute him.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.631
Maybe they should.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.832
He's a terrorist.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.468
I don't know what he did.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.404
How about we all
just assume the CIA

18:57.437 --> 18:59.372
doesn't send three
badasses after the guy

18:59.406 --> 19:01.774
who's in charge of
the local Rotary Club.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.343
Let me remind you.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.712
Basayev's ass is on the line.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.514
So is yours.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.748
This is a black op.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.451
There is absolutely
zero accountability

19:11.484 --> 19:12.952
for anything that
happens out here.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.188
And if you get in the way, Abe
Froman might just chop you up

19:15.222 --> 19:16.856
and spit on your grave
ten different times.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.559
That's a pretty good point.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.760
No, I agree.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.894
But, come here.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.499
Seriously, has anything good

19:26.533 --> 19:27.834
ever come from listening
to that guy?

19:27.867 --> 19:28.768
Hey, you know
I don't have

19:28.801 --> 19:30.337
to hear you to know
what you're saying.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.938
We're the same person.
All right!

19:31.971 --> 19:33.306
Would you both just shut up?!

19:33.340 --> 19:35.342
I'm thinking.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.982
REBECCA:
Carla Paz?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.317
Feds?

19:44.351 --> 19:45.818
FBI, couple of questions.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.819
Some people
you might've worked with.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.355
Well, it'd have to be
quick. I got clients.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.889
Okay, here's the quick version.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.759
Merrick,
Kellerman and Petrov.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.826
Drawing a blank.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.562
You sure?
Because the CIA

19:55.595 --> 19:57.230
has it in their heads
that you all worked together.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.831
Chechnya, 2011.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.667
Anything like that,
you know I can't talk about it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.269
BOYLE:
Your team is active again.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.670
Stateside this time.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.304
They helped themselves
to someone

20:04.337 --> 20:06.873
who's important to the FBI.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.575
Someone who's important to me.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.911
I got no love for Dean Merrick.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946
So I'll just tell you this.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.881
I don't know where they are.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.384
But if that team's
working together again,

20:17.417 --> 20:21.020
it probably has to do
with Aleksey Basayev.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.890
(static crackling)

20:23.923 --> 20:24.924
Hey.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.859
Sorry.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.895
Uh, listen.

20:28.928 --> 20:32.832
If I told you that the plan
was to kill Aleksey Basayev,

20:32.865 --> 20:34.867
would you be surprised?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.769
How surprised?
Scale of one to ten.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.671
Did they tell you that's
what we're doing?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.273
I'm a comms guy.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.708
They tell me
where to bring my stuff

20:41.741 --> 20:42.942
and how many days
I'm on contract.

20:42.975 --> 20:43.876
I like it that way.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.977
Cameron,

20:45.011 --> 20:47.013
we're in the United States.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.815
Did you just call me Cameron?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.783
Yeah, sorry,
that's a nickname thing.

20:50.817 --> 20:51.918
We can't just
kill that guy,

20:51.951 --> 20:55.021
cut him up and bury him
in a bunch of different holes.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.956
So file a case
with the World Court.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.991
Listen to me.
This is a scandal.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.328
We help keep
this guy alive,

21:01.361 --> 21:02.862
we get him back to a jail...

21:02.895 --> 21:04.931
it'll be good for both of us.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.799
I'm the science experiment, man.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.468
I know people
in high places.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.902
You want to work a walkie-talkie

21:09.936 --> 21:11.538
on black ops
the rest of your life?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.941
I could talk to the Navy.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.644
Could maybe make you a SEAL.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.318
Kellerman and Petrov
are stone killers.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.687
No way we outflank them,
even with that pill.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.989
No, we wouldn't even
have to fight them.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.524
You just have
to make it impossible

21:31.558 --> 21:33.760
for them to kill Basayev.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.696
You control
the comms rig.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.064
You can put out
a distress signal

21:38.097 --> 21:40.967
to the forest rangers,
get them out here.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.602
It's a lot harder
to murder someone

21:42.635 --> 21:44.003
when there are civilians around.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.779
I can't make the distress call
from here.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.981
We're in earshot.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.017
I'll take my rig
out to the woods,

21:58.050 --> 22:01.053
tell the rangers I'm a lost
hiker with a broken leg.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.524
All right.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.328
Good deal.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.033
Aleksey Basayev
fought for the Spetsnaz

22:14.066 --> 22:16.002
in the last Chechen war.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.937
He married a local woman
and stayed in Chechnya

22:17.970 --> 22:19.105
after the fighting was over.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.008
Chechnya exports jihadis
by the busload.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.077
Aleksey's new father-in-law
took CIA money

22:25.111 --> 22:26.212
in exchange for a pledge

22:26.245 --> 22:28.948
to help keep the kids
in his teip from going bad guy.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.518
Except he was working
both sides.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.486
Sent the money
straight on to the Taliban.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.054
Was Basayev in on the con?

22:35.087 --> 22:36.789
No, not at all.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.558
Basayev agreed
to help us

22:38.591 --> 22:40.660
if we promised

22:40.693 --> 22:43.596
to abduct the father-in-law
quick and surgical.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.598
We made the deal.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.067
Then... on the day...

22:48.100 --> 22:51.538
we got word that there'd be
a Taliban warlord there.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.172
Merrick decided

22:53.205 --> 22:55.041
he didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.709
You bombed the compound.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.412
His wife, kid...

22:59.446 --> 23:00.747
everyone else?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.582
Killed.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.116
So Basayev wasn't even
a real terrorist?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.618
He helped us.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.186
And when word got out

23:07.219 --> 23:09.589
Basayev left
just before the bomb hit,

23:09.622 --> 23:10.857
he got branded a traitor.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.959
The brother

23:12.992 --> 23:14.694
of the Taliban mullah
killed in the attack

23:14.727 --> 23:16.028
put a price on his head.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.564
$5 million for his corpse.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.566
$10 million

23:19.599 --> 23:21.568
if you deliver him alive.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.769
Basayev
came here

23:22.802 --> 23:23.770
to kill Merrick.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.638
So Brian's in the woods
with three mercenaries

23:25.672 --> 23:28.608
and a guy with a $10 million
bounty on his head.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.726
Nyet.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.797
Hey. Stand clear
of the prisoner.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.499
Where's my comms guy?

23:52.532 --> 23:53.766
Uh, you know.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.967
Call of duty.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.970
Yeah, well,
we're about done

23:58.004 --> 24:01.140
chatting with
our friend, all right?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.174
Gonna take a walk.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.110
A walk? Why?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.078
If you ask me again,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.147
I might just give
you the answer.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.148
You don't want that.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.683
Stand down.

24:10.717 --> 24:11.718
You'll be home soon.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.792
Yo, I think they're
gonna do it now.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.728
Relax, I got this.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.663
Hey! Kellerman!

24:25.197 --> 24:26.699
I told you.

24:26.733 --> 24:27.634
No names
in front of...

24:31.070 --> 24:32.705
What did you do?

24:32.739 --> 24:34.841
Why did you do that?
There are people coming.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.643
There's no one coming.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.845
I didn't call
anybody.

24:38.878 --> 24:39.979
Kellerman took us out here

24:40.012 --> 24:42.682
to interrogate Basayev,
then kill him.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.684
Me and Petrov have our own plan.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.786
We're gonna sell him

24:46.819 --> 24:49.756
for $10 million.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.165
(birds singing)

25:01.934 --> 25:04.270
You're alive 'cause you're
the Six Million Dollar Man,

25:04.303 --> 25:06.939
and that makes you
our insurance policy.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.976
We plan to hike out of here,
quick and quiet,

25:10.009 --> 25:13.012
but if anything
goes south?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.281
No way they drop
artillery on you.

25:15.314 --> 25:18.084
So you knew.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.687
This whole time
we've been out here,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.722
you knew you were
gonna kill him.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.893
You slow us down...

25:26.926 --> 25:29.328
do anything to make me nervous?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.864
I'm more than willing to go
without insurance.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.633
Play nice...

25:33.666 --> 25:36.135
when we get out of here,

25:36.168 --> 25:37.904
we'll cut you loose.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.683
REBECCA:
Cut you loose?

25:52.351 --> 25:54.553
Do you really
believe that?

25:59.325 --> 26:00.292
Rebecca? What?

26:00.326 --> 26:03.730
I'm not always going to be
a version of you.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.865
Your NZT is wearing off
and you need advice.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.066
I'm happy to give it.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.668
Or the version of me

26:08.701 --> 26:10.603
that lives inside of your head
is happy to give it.

26:10.637 --> 26:13.272
But, Brian, I have to be honest:

26:13.305 --> 26:15.174
I wish you didn't
dress me like this.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.976
But you get to be Sloane.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.311
Sloane's the best.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.847
These people are
going to kill you.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.048
You know that, right?

26:22.081 --> 26:25.317
I know you know it,
because you're me.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.986
They are not going
to cut you loose.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.688
And if you don't
do something,

26:28.721 --> 26:30.623
you are gonna die
in these woods.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.358
I still got that one pill
in my pocket.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.960
But even on the pill,

26:33.993 --> 26:36.328
I don't think you can take
two trained soldiers.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.031
And you are a long way
from the edge of the woods.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.767
You got a better idea?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.334
This is not a Band
of Brothers moment.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.703
We're talking about

26:43.736 --> 26:45.838
two mercenaries who
murdered their boss

26:45.872 --> 26:47.674
so they could split
$10 million.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.677
Turn one against the other.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.112
No, but see,
even if I can pull that off,

26:53.145 --> 26:56.716
that leaves one heavily armed
dude still standing.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.918
You have a weapon, too.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.287
Remember the way that Cameron
was talking about NZT?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.856
If he knew you had a pill,
he'd be dying to take it.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.024
Okay, great.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.427
So we make him into a highly
intelligent super soldier.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.829
That's an awesome plan, Sloane.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.330
I mean, hats off to you.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.965
I wish the laws
of physics

27:12.999 --> 27:14.300
would allow me
to strangle you right now.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.403
You have a pill
that he wants.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.805
Remember the book
that you read

27:18.838 --> 27:20.306
after you ate the
pokeweed berries?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.846
You want me to poison him.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.949
You're asking me
to kill someone?

27:29.982 --> 27:30.950
I'm sorry.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.753
I really am.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.288
But I want
you to live.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.091
Which means these guys
have to die.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.197
Little something to keep
the mosquitoes away.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.933
Quick question.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.434
Does your buddy over there
really strike you

27:48.467 --> 27:50.069
as a fifty-fifty split
type of guy?

27:50.102 --> 27:51.871
You said
Basayev's worth

27:51.904 --> 27:53.205
$10 million to someone.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.741
I'm guessing you guys are doing
some kind of split.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.810
But if I know my quiet, psycho,

27:57.844 --> 27:59.779
in-desperate-need-of-a-hug
mercenary types,

27:59.812 --> 28:01.948
I'd be surprised if there
winds up being a split at all.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.916
(chuckles)
Uh-huh.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.184
He already got you
to shoot your boss.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.853
Basayev's
all bound up.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.755
Why wouldn't he just keep
the entire bounty for himself?

28:11.824 --> 28:12.291
(sputters)

28:12.324 --> 28:13.826
We made a deal.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.894
Oh, you made a deal.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.495
Okay. You shake on it?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.164
Well, that's ironclad.
Forget I said anything.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.732
Of course,

28:19.766 --> 28:21.768
you could take him out.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.302
Walk away a winner for once.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.838
I need him.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.740
He's got the connect
to the heroin traffickers

28:27.774 --> 28:29.809
who are gonna bring Basayev back
to the guy with the money.

28:29.842 --> 28:30.877
Yeah, you need him.

28:30.910 --> 28:31.911
Does he need you?

28:32.879 --> 28:33.846
Listen, man.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.114
My pill's about to wear off,

28:35.147 --> 28:36.783
but I've got one more.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.350
It's been in my pocket
this entire time.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.852
If you get rid of
the translator, I'll take it.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.788
It can't be that hard
to figure out a way

28:41.821 --> 28:43.756
to get Basayev
to the people that want him.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.826
That's $10 million.

28:46.859 --> 28:47.927
All for you.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.930
Or whatever your pal
has planned.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.333
BRIAN:
You can't see much of the woods

28:54.366 --> 28:56.202
when you've got a black bag
over your head.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.837
But if you work the tie loose,

28:57.870 --> 28:59.772
you can see what's growing
at your feet.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.841
Stuff like...
nightshade berries.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.543
Thank you, Counselor Dan.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.378
It seems like you want me to be,

29:06.412 --> 29:08.014
I don't know, embarrassed?
Apologetic?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.817
You betrayed your own source

29:10.850 --> 29:11.951
and then bombed a compound

29:11.984 --> 29:14.453
with more than 20 people
inside of it.

29:14.486 --> 29:15.955
For argument's sake,
let's just say

29:15.988 --> 29:17.056
I'm willing to admit
to the operation

29:17.089 --> 29:18.057
you guys are describing.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.291
Yes.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.292
I called in a drone.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.928
The facts on
the ground changed,

29:21.961 --> 29:23.329
so I changed the plan.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.897
All perfectly legal.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.266
And now you're staging
a black op on American soil

29:27.299 --> 29:30.436
in direct violation of an
executive order prohibiting it.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.904
So file an injunction.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.205
Prove it.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.573
Call me if you get anywhere
with that.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.942
REBECCA:
What you did in Chechnya

29:35.975 --> 29:37.810
might not
have been illegal.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.311
But it would make
for a good story.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.447
Americans betraying a source,

29:41.480 --> 29:44.050
bombing a compound
with his family inside.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.152
I could see that on the front
page of a paper somewhere.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.153
What do you people want?

29:47.186 --> 29:48.855
He should be on a chopper home
in a few hours.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.522
I want to talk to Brian.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.491
I want to know he's okay.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.011
(comms chiming)

30:12.044 --> 30:13.279
Oh, hell.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.554
Damn, it's Merrick.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.895
I need to tell you
what I'm gonna do,

30:28.928 --> 30:29.896
you don't play ball?

30:29.929 --> 30:32.298
I think I got it.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.367
Where's your team leader?

30:35.401 --> 30:37.203
Problems.
Nothing we could do.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.637
MERRICK:
What about the target?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.941
In our custody and on the way
to the extraction point.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.509
Running behind schedule, is all.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.212
Need maybe... 12 hours.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.546
Target was deep in the bush.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.481
And our resource?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.217
Other than being
slow as a dung beetle,

30:51.250 --> 30:53.019
worst he's got is mosquito bites
and blisters.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.286
I want to talk to him.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.287
He just told you...

30:55.321 --> 30:56.889
Put him on now, Merrick.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.490
We got a couple of nervous
Nellies here at the barn,

30:58.524 --> 30:59.926
want a word with the resource.

30:59.959 --> 31:00.960
Copy that.

31:00.993 --> 31:01.994
Brian!

31:04.663 --> 31:06.165
Hey, guys.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.533
Oh, is that Naz?

31:07.566 --> 31:09.101
What's going on out there,
Brian?

31:09.135 --> 31:10.436
Well, it's pretty much
like the man said.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.637
You know, it got hairy there

31:11.670 --> 31:12.939
for a minute,
out here in the forest.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.074
It's a little brisk,
little bit cold.

31:15.107 --> 31:18.044
So luckily,
I've just been bundled up,

31:18.077 --> 31:19.311
keeping warm in my warren,

31:19.345 --> 31:21.147
all safe and sound.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.215
Yeah, I mean, it's like
you guys taught me, right?

31:23.249 --> 31:24.450
I got to be an island?

31:24.483 --> 31:25.617
And all that jazz?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.686
Are you okay?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.655
You know what, I think
I got the pinkeye.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.058
Can you look in there?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.993
CAMERON:
Okay, there he is.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.963
We'll put some ointment
on whatever's bugging him,

31:36.996 --> 31:38.497
get him back to you shipshape.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.598
Anything else?

31:39.631 --> 31:41.400
12 hours.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.436
Copy all.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.337
Happy?

31:45.371 --> 31:47.239
NAZ:
No, I am not happy.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.440
People are being killed
out there,

31:48.474 --> 31:49.708
and my consultant's
in the middle of it.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.511
(door opens)

31:52.544 --> 31:54.346
What are you doing?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.251
Did Brian seem
overly cheerful to you?

31:59.285 --> 32:02.021
Almost like he was trying
to emphasize certain words

32:02.054 --> 32:03.189
without being obvious?

32:03.222 --> 32:04.957
He always seems
overly cheerful to me.

32:04.991 --> 32:05.724
(scoffs)

32:05.757 --> 32:07.994
Yeah, maybe. Why?

32:08.027 --> 32:10.629
All that about being
in a warren, up in the forest?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.064
Check this out.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.032
Warren and Forest Counties

32:13.065 --> 32:15.234
are mostly made up
of the Allegheny State Park.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.070
That last thing
about being an island.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.006
There's a little section
of the park

32:20.039 --> 32:21.240
that runs along those counties.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.542
Allegheny Islands
Wilderness area.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.313
He's drawing us a map.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.085
You better be right about this.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.121
(gunshot)

32:35.154 --> 32:37.990
(gasps) Oh, my God.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.558
No, no, no.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.260
Don't turn away.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.528
This is what you wanted.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.130
Take a good look.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.034
Now you're gonna
hand me that pill.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.437
No one else can take it.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.139
You said the side effects happen
after a few doses.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.006
Hand it over.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.775
I'm taking the last one.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.446
I get to see what it feels like
to be the smart guy.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.181
Uh...

33:02.214 --> 33:05.184
you, uh,
should probably

33:05.217 --> 33:06.285
look behind you.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.521
(choking, thumps)

33:09.555 --> 33:11.557
(groaning)

33:33.779 --> 33:35.414
(groaning)

33:38.484 --> 33:39.685
Wait, wait,
that doesn't sound right.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.720
I can't speak Russian.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.156
I'm not on NZT, okay?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.491
I tried to save you.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.659
I tried
to keep you alive.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.562
Give me the pill.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.564
You speak English?

33:52.598 --> 33:54.466
Everyone speak some English.
Give me the pill.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.536
I can't.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.438
(sighs)

33:59.471 --> 34:01.473
Thank you.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.582
This pill,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.618
it gives you answers, da?

34:12.651 --> 34:14.453
Fix problems?

34:15.521 --> 34:18.724
Uh, yeah, it can, but...

34:18.757 --> 34:20.792
This weight,

34:20.826 --> 34:22.528
all the time it is on me.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.432
I need answers in here, see?

34:28.234 --> 34:31.170
I have lost so much.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.372
I only want peace.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.476
You won't get it
from that pill, though.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.211
It's poisoned.

34:39.245 --> 34:42.114
Seriously, I mixed it

34:42.148 --> 34:43.815
with Belladonna.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.451
It could kill you.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.654
That's a kind of peace, too.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.564
*

35:08.240 --> 35:10.242
(groaning)

35:11.843 --> 35:14.480
BRIAN: I tried to find
the edge of the woods,

35:14.513 --> 35:15.814
but I wasn't on NZT.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.483
I couldn't remember the maps.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.584
At the end of the day,

35:18.617 --> 35:20.586
I just circled right back
to where I started.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.621
(groans)

35:29.361 --> 35:31.363
(groans)

35:43.375 --> 35:49.215
* When Brian was
in Egypt's land *

35:49.248 --> 35:54.620
(echoing):
* Let my Brian go.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.655
(insects chirping)

35:59.425 --> 36:01.560
REBECCA (echoing):
So much for taking the day off.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.797
I don't think
I can do this.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.666
It's all in your head.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.934
Get up.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.269
I'm dying.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.637
You're not dying.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.639
You just can't think
of anything good to do.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.873
(sighs)

36:14.906 --> 36:17.543
But this is all wrong.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.512
Now, I'm Ferris.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.714
Everything's supposed
to work out for me.

36:22.748 --> 36:23.849
No.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.585
You have to make it work.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.687
But how?

36:38.264 --> 36:40.266
(prolonged screaming)

36:46.438 --> 36:48.407
(hoots)
(screeching)

36:48.440 --> 36:49.608
(screaming continues)

36:59.485 --> 37:01.487
(screaming ends)

37:05.824 --> 37:07.493
REBECCA:
Brian?

37:07.526 --> 37:08.827
Brian, wake up.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.763
(laughs)

37:11.797 --> 37:12.864
You did it.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.934
You saved Ferris.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.505
First to die was Rooney.

37:19.538 --> 37:20.506
Um, sorry.

37:20.539 --> 37:21.773
Kellerman.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.775
Rooney was just a nickname
I gave him.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.411
After that, I figured, um,

37:25.444 --> 37:26.678
if I was gonna survive,

37:26.712 --> 37:28.013
I needed to figure out a way

37:28.046 --> 37:29.648
to kill Hollinger and Petrov.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.484
So I convinced Cameron--

37:32.518 --> 37:33.619
what was his real name?

37:33.652 --> 37:34.986
Kyle Hollinger.

37:35.020 --> 37:38.357
Right, I convinced him
to shoot Abe Froman.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.392
Uh, then I just
had to figure out

37:40.426 --> 37:41.793
how to get him to
swallow the poison.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.696
And Aleksey Basayev took
care of that for me.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.332
Luckily, or I guess.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.666
So...

37:47.699 --> 37:49.501
Do you think Aleksey Basayev

37:49.535 --> 37:50.802
gained any intel
from Kyle Hollinger

37:50.836 --> 37:51.703
before he killed him?

37:51.737 --> 37:54.606
Um...

37:54.640 --> 37:56.074
Well, the only thing I heard

37:56.107 --> 37:57.909
was the sound of him
choking on his own blood.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.811
Excuse me.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.382
Yeah, anyway,
that's pretty much it, Naz.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.683
Brian.

38:04.716 --> 38:05.250
This should never

38:05.283 --> 38:06.752
have happened to you.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.986
And it's my fault that it did.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.655
No, you didn't sign the order.

38:09.688 --> 38:10.856
No, no,

38:10.889 --> 38:11.957
you are my responsibility.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.892
Now, you and I have had
our moments,

38:13.925 --> 38:15.427
but I want you to
know I will find

38:15.461 --> 38:16.595
the people
responsible for this.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.074
(sighs)

38:29.107 --> 38:30.742
You really believe Naz
didn't know about this?

38:32.578 --> 38:35.614
She really stuck her neck out
to get you back.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.717
So I think I do.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.985
You okay?

38:40.018 --> 38:42.921
You ducked out of that
meeting kind of fast.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.756
Amokay?

38:44.790 --> 38:47.359
I'm not the one
that just survived

38:47.393 --> 38:49.728
some backwoods nightmare.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.730
(sighs)

38:51.763 --> 38:54.132
Hearing you talk about it,
you sound so detached.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.768
When you first came here,

38:56.802 --> 38:59.805
you were in a bad patch,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.707
but you still had this way
of looking at things.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.941
Like...

39:02.974 --> 39:06.578
Like the world
hadn't touched you yet.

39:06.612 --> 39:07.879
(chuckles)

39:07.913 --> 39:08.947
I think I wanted
to protect that.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.517
I think that's why I fought
so hard to get you here.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.784
And instead, you're...

39:12.818 --> 39:15.120
listening to people
choke each other and...

39:17.489 --> 39:20.125
You had someone else's blood
on your face when I found you.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.396
You want to know what?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.932
I was gonna take a day off,

39:26.965 --> 39:28.934
before all this.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.403
Man, I was so happy

39:31.437 --> 39:32.771
when I woke up that morning.

39:32.804 --> 39:33.972
It felt like before.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.674
Like the good parts of before.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.545
I'm sorry you had to see
those things.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.913
I'm really sorry
you had to do those things.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.450
I didn't have much
of a choice in that.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.885
It was either this

39:46.918 --> 39:50.756
or being a fry cook on Venus.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.025
Oh, my God.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.727
You've really never seen
Ferris Bueller before,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.029
have you?
How is that possible?

39:58.063 --> 39:59.598
How-- you know what?

39:59.631 --> 40:00.766
I got it.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.167
I have it on VHS
at my parents' place.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.469
We're gonna watch it right now.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.504
Mike! Mike!
Keep your voice down.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.874
