There isn't time!
[ Whistles ]

13:57.068 --> 13:59.503
- No way!
- Yes way!

14:00.438 --> 14:02.406
Thataway!

14:04.209 --> 14:07.010
We're coming up on Hudson.
They gotta be
around here somewhere.

14:11.683 --> 14:13.384
Hey, what's that for?

14:13.452 --> 14:17.221
There's a surcharge
for ambulance service.
Especially when it's for me!

14:28.700 --> 14:29.400
Now!

14:35.339 --> 14:38.709
I'm canceling
your blaster permit!
[ Grunts ]

14:44.416 --> 14:46.450
[ Shouts ]

14:49.087 --> 14:51.822
Who says
you can never get a cab
in this city?

14:54.092 --> 14:55.726
Lord Dregg.
[ Pants ]

14:55.794 --> 14:59.396
I'm transferring
the Turtles' coordinates
to your computer now.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.498
Coordinates locked in.

15:01.599 --> 15:03.533
And now I'll have
their mutagen...

15:03.601 --> 15:07.271
and become the most
powerful being in the world.

15:24.689 --> 15:29.493
[ Groans ]
You know, something tells me
we missed that turn onto 16th.

15:29.594 --> 15:31.562
[ Dregg ]
Welcome back, my friends.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.764
Thank you for delivering
the Turtles.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.567
I suggest none of you resists.

15:36.701 --> 15:39.236
If there's one thing
you can count on, Dregg,

15:39.304 --> 15:41.305
it's that we're gonna resist.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.407
[ All ]
Turtle power!

15:55.820 --> 15:58.922
Oh, great!
There goes my insurance premium.

16:06.631 --> 16:09.232
[ Growls ]

16:09.301 --> 16:11.769
Eww!
Get a life, guano breath.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.076
No fare is worth
this kind of stress!

16:36.194 --> 16:38.195
[ Growls ]

16:39.664 --> 16:41.231
You win.
I surrender.

16:44.936 --> 16:48.873
[ Groans ]
Game's over,
you repugnant reptile.

16:50.608 --> 16:52.108
Let him go.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.411
Drop your weapons.

16:54.546 --> 16:55.746
Whatever you say, Krang.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.651
Now!

17:01.786 --> 17:02.919
Whoa, whoa!

17:08.859 --> 17:11.595
[ Tires Screeching ]

17:16.201 --> 17:17.666
There isn't much time.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.304
Join me,
and we'll stop
the Turtles together...

17:20.338 --> 17:22.205
then rule the planet.

17:22.272 --> 17:27.377
Under the circumstances,
we really don't have any choice.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.620
[ All ]
Whoa!

17:38.356 --> 17:40.924
There's one chance
to stop them.
Cover me!

17:50.168 --> 17:52.702
There.
I've set the coordinates.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.704
- On what?
- Our lair.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.807
Hang on!

17:56.809 --> 17:59.443
[ Dregg ]
Give up, Turtles.
You're outnumbered.

18:05.316 --> 18:07.050
[ All Shouting ]

18:10.188 --> 18:12.989
Looks like
your little game
is over, Dregg.

18:13.057 --> 18:14.391
But, hey, don't worry.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.860
We got you three, lovely
one-way coach
transporter tickets,

18:16.895 --> 18:18.228
back to Dimension X.

18:18.363 --> 18:19.663
No!

18:19.731 --> 18:22.866
I won't go back to Dimension X!

18:26.137 --> 18:28.071
[ Beeping ]

18:28.973 --> 18:30.941
He's draining the reactor core!

18:30.976 --> 18:33.343
There will be a meltdown
in 20 seconds!

18:33.345 --> 18:36.614
- Well, there goes
the neighborhood.
- We've gotta stop it!

18:37.281 --> 18:38.848
[ Grunts ]

18:42.721 --> 18:43.987
[ Gasps ]

18:44.122 --> 18:46.589
Give up,
or you'll be needing
a new leader!

19:06.644 --> 19:08.545
[ Sighs ]
I hope the guys are okay.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.347
Huh. What am I talking about?

19:10.415 --> 19:13.883
They did fine
before I came along.
They'll do fine without me.

19:24.662 --> 19:27.297
Uh, does this remind you
of something?

19:27.365 --> 19:31.869
Yes.<i> The Invasion</i>
<i>of the Aliezoids,</i>
directed by Ed Cood, 1957.

19:31.936 --> 19:35.706
Great!
Our life's been reduced
to a B movie.

19:35.773 --> 19:39.776
In a few minutes, I will be
the most powerful being
in the universe.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.813
Uh, you probably don't
want to hear this, Dregg,

19:42.880 --> 19:46.450
but you're showing
definite symptoms
of galactic megalomania...

19:46.518 --> 19:49.118
with delusions
of cosmic consciousness.

19:49.186 --> 19:51.087
In other words,
you're a wacko.

19:52.523 --> 19:55.559
[ Murmurs ]
The elements
you stole from me...

19:55.627 --> 20:00.898
to stabilize your mutations
have genetically incubated
in your bodies.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.401
[ Raphael ]
You mean, you wanted us
to stabilize our mutations?

20:04.469 --> 20:06.002
Of course.

20:07.705 --> 20:11.642
It was the only way I could
create the super mutagen.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.178
Mung, start the transfusion,
will you?

20:15.180 --> 20:18.815
Oh, yes--
[ Panting ]
Lord Dregg.

20:22.053 --> 20:26.456
Why do I get the feeling
this isn't going to be covered
under our health insurance?

20:26.524 --> 20:28.992
Is it okay to be pumping
that stuff out of us?

20:29.060 --> 20:32.429
Oh, don't worry.
You won't be needing it
any longer.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.332
It's time.
Yes, it is.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.800
[ Groans ]

20:36.867 --> 20:38.769
Time for us to take over.

20:38.803 --> 20:41.038
You promised to work with me.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.007
Shredder takes orders
from no one.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.009
Especially an alien.

20:46.077 --> 20:49.446
[ Sighs ]
Especially
an incredibly ugly alien.

20:49.513 --> 20:52.248
But I can make you
a super being.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.685
We don't need you
for that, Dregg.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.119
Now get on the table.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.259
You fools don't know
what you're doing.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.028
You have
a new leader now, Mung.

21:05.096 --> 21:09.899
Prepare the apparatus
to transfuse their life energy
into Krang and me.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.936
As you wish.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.623
Activate
the transformation, Mung.

No!

That's it, my little friends.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.439
Now build me
two more operating tables.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.015
What are you going to do to us?

21:59.150 --> 22:01.584
What I intended to do all along.

22:01.653 --> 22:06.089
Drain the mutagen
from the Turtles
and absorb your mental energy,

22:06.157 --> 22:12.228
making myself the most powerful
and intelligent mutant
in all the universe.

22:12.364 --> 22:16.666
Oh, and by the way,
you'll all be drained of your
life energy in the process.

It's working!
