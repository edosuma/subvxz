WEBVTT

00:08.426 --> 00:10.636
-Hey, that guy's over there.
-What guy?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.263
That guy that told you about
that thing that day.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.681
That thing about the weird dude
and his weird friend

00:13.723 --> 00:15.266
-doing that dumb thing?
-Then you told me and I told you

00:15.307 --> 00:16.475
I'd already heard about it,
and you said it was

00:16.517 --> 00:17.935
a different thing but it wasn't?

00:17.977 --> 00:19.895
-Oh, yeah.
-What's his name? I forget.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.522
I don't know.
Something to do with fish.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.441
-Oh, that's gonna bother me.
-FRED: Hey, Susie.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.277
You hear about the big arthritis
telethon on WNPO next Tuesday?

00:26.318 --> 00:28.571
They're looking for acts
but spots are going fast.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.990
A spot? On TV?
That would be sensational.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.032
Why am I just hearing
about this?

00:32.074 --> 00:33.409
Just heard it myself.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.785
Margie the booker's
at table six.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.163
You gotta give me a heads-up
about these things, Fred.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.873
I don't work for you!

00:38.914 --> 00:40.458
Margie, Susie Myerson.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.460
I rep a comic that would be
great for the telethon.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.669
She's an up-and-comer.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.004
Get someone I know
to vouch for her

00:45.045 --> 00:46.130
and maybe I'll work her in.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.631
Piece of cake.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.133
Dougie, you know Margie?

00:49.175 --> 00:50.926
From way back.
She's doing the telethon.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.803
-Go vouch for my girl?
-Done deal.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.388
Yes.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.223
-MIDGE: Well?
-It's in the bag.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.600
That's fantastic.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.560
-It's dead. Dougie said.
-What? Why?

00:59.602 --> 01:01.353
FRED: Margie hates Dougie.
You should have gone to Kenny.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.356
It's your job to keep me up
to date on these things, Fred.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.108
I don't work for you!

01:06.150 --> 01:07.234
♪ Oh, you gotta... ♪

01:07.276 --> 01:09.111
Shit.

01:09.153 --> 01:12.364
-Where's Margie?
-Must've left.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.992
Her assistant's at table 12.
She can pull the trigger.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.494
Good thing for you, Fred.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.162
I don't work for you!

01:18.204 --> 01:21.415
Listen. I've got a hot gal with
a lot of talent for you.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.167
Get the hell away from my table.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.211
-Bitch.
-(scoffs)

01:25.252 --> 01:27.004
The chick's a stiff.

01:27.046 --> 01:29.507
Wait, did I say table 12?
I meant table ten.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.217
Hey!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.969
-Kenny, you get along
with Margie?
-I love Margie.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.179
-You'll vouch for my girl?
-Sure thing.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.263
Thanks.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.058
Hey, sorry about
the bitch thing.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.728
-Margie's assistant?
-Who's askin'?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.146
Have I got a comic for
the telethon.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.272
Kenny'll vouch for her.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.066
-Kenny?
-Problem?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.818
-Cindy likes you.
-Margie's girl?

01:48.859 --> 01:51.278
-Take her to dinner? Thanks.
-Why not?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.614
-I got you dinner with Kenny.
-Hey, neat.

01:53.656 --> 01:54.615
My girl's name is Maisel.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.033
I'll tell Margie to slot her in.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.244
Good deal.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.496
-Done.
-Done?

02:00.538 --> 02:02.873
Done.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.167
-Joey Mackerel.
-That's the guy's name.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.460
I was right about fish.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.087
I was thinking branzino.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.713
Mm. Joey Branzino's
someone else.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.423
He's not even in the business.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.175
MIDGE: Why are so many guys here
named after fish?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.426
SUSIE:
Beats me.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.720
-There you go.
-Thank you, Zelda.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.639
The potatoes certainly look nice
and fluffy.

02:18.681 --> 02:21.851
I know that's how you like them,
Mrs. Weissman.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.394
Thank you, Zelda.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.896
You're welcome.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.482
Zelda seems subtly hostile
to me this week.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.109
How do you figure?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.902
The way she served the potatoes.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.029
Yours, she served gently;

02:34.071 --> 02:35.990
mine, she slopped down
like we're in Attica.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.366
Oh, she didn't.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.826
Yours are still nice and fluffy.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.703
Mine have lost all their fluffy.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.454
Mine, she slopped down
a little, too.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.331
But you got a "there you go."
And so did your mother.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.916
I didn't get a "there you go."

02:45.958 --> 02:47.751
-You're imagining this, Abe.
-I like a nice

02:47.793 --> 02:49.169
"there you go."

02:49.211 --> 02:52.006
Or even an enthusiastic "enjoy."

02:52.047 --> 02:54.300
-Start a new subject, Miriam.
-Well...

02:54.341 --> 02:56.552
there's a telethon next week.
You hear about it?

02:56.594 --> 02:58.762
Ugh. That Jerry Lewis thing?
He's so loud.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.764
ROSE: And I don't like those
facial distortions of his,

03:00.806 --> 03:02.349
and that crazy voice;
it feels desperate.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.727
Jerry Lewis is
muscular dystrophy.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.896
This is a telethon for arthritis
and rheumatism.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.148
-Oh, such a good cause.
-A very good cause.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.774
Your mother's family suffers
from it, you know.

03:10.816 --> 03:11.817
-Great Aunt Pearl.
-Poor woman

03:11.859 --> 03:13.152
with those gnarled hands.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.737
One day she picked up
a Kiddush cup

03:14.778 --> 03:16.155
and she couldn't set it down
for two years.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.406
ABE:
We should donate.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.783
Those dollars are so important
for research.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.119
Mm-hmm. How do we do that?
Call the broadcast?

03:22.161 --> 03:24.955
Probably. There'll be phone
banks and celebrity guests

03:24.997 --> 03:27.750
and performers,
all volunteering their time.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.627
-Wonderful.
-So selfless.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.295
-I'll be one of them.
-One of what?

03:31.337 --> 03:32.671
One of the performers.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.176
I'll be performing on
the telethon.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.220
Doing comedy.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.680
Can I use the Kiddush cup bit?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.140
Some of them are scams.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.183
-What are?
-These telethons.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.476
They take the money

03:45.517 --> 03:46.810
and line their own pockets.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.897
-Jerry Lewis has multiple homes.
-Mama, that's ridiculous.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.106
And those telethons look
so cheap.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.275
The cameramen never know what
to focus on.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.736
-Not true.
-And no one's ever died
from arthritis.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.196
Aunt Pearl lived to be 90.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.864
Just her head and neck worked
at the end,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.991
but it's all she needed
for a full life.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.413
Excuse me.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.917
Mind if I join you?

04:09.959 --> 04:10.960
Anything wrong, Miss Miriam?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.003
Try everything.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.674
Could you be
a little more dramatic?

04:16.715 --> 04:18.217
Sure. Let me grab my toga

04:18.258 --> 04:20.469
and conjure up a little
Coriolanus for you.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.262
You can't eat with the children.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.639
-Why not?
-They're not used to it.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.140
You'll scare them.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.809
Will it scare you
if I join you for dinner?

04:26.850 --> 04:27.977
No.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.187
Thank you.
(blows raspberry)

04:30.229 --> 04:32.147
Miriam, why are you being
so sensitive?

04:32.189 --> 04:34.358
Stupid me, I thought the
telethon was a good way for you

04:34.400 --> 04:36.610
to see your daughter perform
from the comfort of your home,

04:36.652 --> 04:38.070
but what do I know?

04:38.112 --> 04:40.572
Are you even ready
to appear on television?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.157
There's only one way
to find out.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.034
And your act is clean enough
for television?

04:44.076 --> 04:45.369
The act is clean;

04:45.411 --> 04:47.746
however, I do it in the nude.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.957
That you say that in front
of your son.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.333
You've seen me nude,
right, buddy?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.376
Yes.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.836
There you go.

04:53.877 --> 04:54.920
(blows raspberry)

04:54.962 --> 04:57.506
That's really improved.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.760
(blows raspberry)

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
No, I get it.
The electrical grid is taxed,

05:03.846 --> 05:05.180
you're forcing brownouts,

05:05.222 --> 05:06.348
but can you spread them out
a little?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.392
Every hot summer day,
we get hit.

05:08.434 --> 05:11.270
Ten beats eight, Grandma takes.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.023
No, I get it, but are you
browning out the Upper East Side

05:14.064 --> 05:16.275
on a daily basis, too?
I'm guessing no.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.027
Six beats three.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.279
This is turning into a rout.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.697
Trucks are backed up
at the loading dock.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.699
-Are you aware of this?
-I am now.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.867
This isn't disrespect.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.368
I'm just trying to keep
my business running.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.078
-Con Ed?
-Emphasis on the "Con."

05:28.120 --> 05:31.081
-Ace beats queen. Eat it, son.
-Ma!

05:31.123 --> 05:32.875
That your lunch?
Or yesterday's lunch?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.793
Can we start over?
I really want to solve this.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.003
How 'bout I deal with
the trucks.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.337
I'll go down in a second.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.299
Ha! You lose again.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.010
I'm whomping your ass.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.511
Really, Ma, playing War with him

05:44.553 --> 05:46.430
shouldn't be scarier
than actual war.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.307
He has to learn about losing.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.517
Losing is a part of life.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.019
I'm dealing with the trucks.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.646
Then I want to talk
to you later, okay?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.231
No, no, no.
Don't put me on hold.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.650
-Later, we'll talk?
-Yes, fine.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.819
Because when you put me on hold,
you forget about me,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.571
and I got to start
the whole process over again.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.323
Okay. You want to make this
interesting?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.034
Ask Daddy for cash.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.039
(sighs) Guys, I've been over
and over this,

06:12.081 --> 06:16.168
but I'm just
not understanding why...

06:17.628 --> 06:19.213
Why what, Abe?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.298
Why we're still waiting on
all our equipment.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.008
Must be a backlog.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.886
Hey, Abe, four-letter word,
mountain range in Russia.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.930
-Ural.
-Yes.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.681
I checked in with all
the other teams.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.391
They're not experiencing
backlogs.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.352
BOTH: One, two, three, four,
we declare a thumb war.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.521
(phone rings)

06:35.562 --> 06:37.439
A.I. Nine, this is Devlin.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.191
Uh-huh.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.110
Got it. Yes, yes, I understand.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.529
Will do. Thanks.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.364
-What was that?
-Wrong number.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.158
Okay.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.452
Carry on.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.875
(bell tolls in distance)

07:01.672 --> 07:04.299
Continuing from last lecture,

07:04.341 --> 07:09.429
let us consider a periodic
triangular wave function.

07:09.471 --> 07:13.642
Now, can anyone tell me
what property of this function

07:13.684 --> 07:18.230
we can exploit to reduce our
Fourier series? Truman?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.108
Truman? Where is Truman?
Is he late?

07:21.150 --> 07:23.902
And where are the others?
Wasn't this class bigger?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.446
-It used to be.
-I won't put up with tardiness.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.490
-I won't.
-None of us were late.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.659
-STUDENT: Except you.
-Who said that?

07:30.701 --> 07:33.912
Come on, who said it?

07:33.954 --> 07:38.167
Be man enough to come up here
so I can box your ears.

07:40.043 --> 07:43.297
Let the record show
that there are no men

07:43.338 --> 07:47.134
in Abraham Weissman's Advanced
Differential Equations course.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.387
Just a sad collection
of fatuous,

07:50.429 --> 07:54.933
imbecilic, puerile,
blithering milksops.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.393
-And for the last time...
-(slaps table)

07:56.435 --> 07:58.103
where is Truman?

07:58.145 --> 08:01.523
-He's transferred.
-Transferred? Why?

08:01.565 --> 08:03.400
His mother said it was taking
too much out of him.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.654
His mother...

08:07.696 --> 08:11.575
And why are all of you
still here? Hmm?

08:11.617 --> 08:14.870
Lance? Abbie?

08:14.912 --> 08:17.414
Whoever the hell said
"except you"?

08:17.456 --> 08:20.459
Why are you here?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.837
I have one more math problem
for all of you to solve.

08:26.048 --> 08:29.301
Ready? Here it is.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.804
"All of you..."

08:32.846 --> 08:36.642
plus "X" equals...

08:36.683 --> 08:38.477
"competence."

08:38.518 --> 08:40.020
Solve for "X."

08:40.062 --> 08:43.440
What is "X"?
It's "competence."

08:43.482 --> 08:45.776
Because none of you have any.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.486
You're all incompetent.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.238
You'll never work in any field

08:49.279 --> 08:51.114
that has the word "advanced"
in front of it.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.284
You'll simply be overqualified
dishwasher repairmen.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.912
I keep telling you that
and you keep coming back.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.914
Well, don't. Get out!

08:58.956 --> 09:00.791
-Now?
-Now? Get out!

09:00.832 --> 09:04.670
Go. Go!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.713
(students murmuring)

09:06.755 --> 09:08.465
Get out.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.509
(door closes)

09:13.762 --> 09:16.431
Waste of a good triangular wave.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.058
(laughter)

09:18.100 --> 09:19.559
How about this?
I met one potential date,

09:19.601 --> 09:21.436
and he was perfect
husband material.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.188
I knew he was 'cause that's
what his wife told me.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.648
(laughter)

09:24.690 --> 09:26.066
Yes? No?

09:26.108 --> 09:27.901
Kind of an in-betweener. Reject.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.194
MAN:
I'll marry you!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.738
Who's that? Cousin Shmuly?

09:31.780 --> 09:33.740
Come on, man,
we've talked about this.

09:33.782 --> 09:37.828
My manager's already heard from
WNPO's Broadcast Standards.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.414
That's the TV station's
department of "Don't Be Funny."

09:40.455 --> 09:45.252
They told us nothing political,
or controversial, or profane.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.629
I've got this whole thing about
my parents' sex life,

09:47.671 --> 09:49.548
that's probably not appropriate.
Good-bye.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.133
Let me try this,
this should work:

09:51.174 --> 09:54.094
-Does the Pope get hard-ons?
-(laughter)

09:54.136 --> 09:55.721
I mean, it would explain
the whole obsession

09:55.762 --> 09:58.307
with resurrection.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.891
My people.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.312
-All right.
-(laughter and applause)

10:03.353 --> 10:06.064
-Could you all come with me
to the telethon?
-So... Dr. Benjamin.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.482
-MIDGE: Dick Shawn's
gonna be on before me.
-Yup.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.192
You know, she told me
you were tall,

10:09.234 --> 10:11.778
but she didn't tell me you were
"fun house mirror" tall.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.822
Height runs in my family.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.199
Family of freaks. Yup.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.576
(mimics carnival barker):
Step right up

10:17.617 --> 10:18.994
and see the carnival freaks.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.579
Guess so.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.956
You ever rehearse an argument
you plan on having

10:22.998 --> 10:25.208
with someone in your head,
and during the rehearsal

10:25.250 --> 10:27.336
you're perfectly reasonable
and they're a jerk?

10:27.377 --> 10:29.463
And then the argument actually
happens and they're reasonable

10:29.504 --> 10:31.923
but that's not how you rehearsed
it, so you become the jerk?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.258
(laughter)

10:33.300 --> 10:35.552
-No, no.
-What?

10:35.594 --> 10:37.220
-Don't laugh.
-Why not?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.597
Wasn't funny. Nope.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.848
I call a joke like that
a 50-percenter.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.308
It's 50% there.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.976
You get laughs from people
who are drunk

10:43.018 --> 10:44.770
or super easy to please,
but that's not good enough.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.355
Not good enough for me,
not good enough for her.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.397
Nope, nope, nope.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.275
Seemed funny to me.
And everyone around me.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.194
Well, it wasn't.
Okay? It wasn't.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.654
MIDGE: ...for the first time
behind Midge Maisel.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.990
Well, you are the worst audience
I could have auditioned

10:57.032 --> 10:59.117
my TV-friendly material to,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.995
which is why I love you.
Thanks, guys.

11:02.037 --> 11:06.708
Watch the telethon and even give
some money to it, ya schnorrers.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.752
-(cheers and applause)
-Whoo!

11:13.048 --> 11:15.050
SUSIE:
That's become a thing now, too.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.386
Can't get between her
and her public now, you know?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.971
They will break every
over-elongated bone

11:20.013 --> 11:22.265
-in your body.
-She's a star in the making.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.726
Yeah, I know that.
I'm telling you that.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.937
So what did you think?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.480
I think we're gonna need
a few more sessions.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.023
Work out some of those kinks.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.650
I was asking Benjamin.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.360
Oh, sure, yeah.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.529
I think you were sensational.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.864
Gee, thanks.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.575
So kiss her.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.993
-Susie.
-That's okay.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.662
No, kiss her.
Go ahead, it's fine.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.248
-We're adults here, right?
-(Midge clears throat)

11:46.289 --> 11:48.875
Lay one on her, man.
Bend down and kiss her.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.799
Pretty skimpy there.
Give her a big smacker, man.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.259
There you go.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.013
You were getting a Pope hard-on
yourself, huh?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.058
Yeah.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.144
I'll call you
about work sessions.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.396
Sure.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.273
That's your manager?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.233
-You get used to her.
-Really?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.485
-Mm.
-So where do you want to go?

12:15.527 --> 12:17.737
-Let's go to your place.
-Every night.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.322
Okay, one more time,

12:19.364 --> 12:20.866
you're supposed to ask
for dinner first.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.534
Can we have dinner
at your place?

12:22.576 --> 12:23.994
-Sure.
-And can we skip dinner?

12:24.035 --> 12:25.912
-You're exhausting.
-(laughs)

12:25.954 --> 12:27.956
♪ ♪

12:29.082 --> 12:31.084
(singers vocalizing)

12:35.505 --> 12:38.091
Wow. So this is really
happening?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.218
-This is really happening.
-Talent?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.262
-You bet.
-You bring your sheet music?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.264
-She's not a singer.
Mrs. Maisel?
-I'm a comedian.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.766
You're down for five minutes
at 2150.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.768
-At what?
-We do military time.
2150 is 9:50 at night.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.353
If you get confused,
just add the number 12

12:50.395 --> 12:52.397
-to whatever time it is.
-Add what to what?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.733
-MAN (over mic): Next.
-Follow me?
-Sure.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.610
-I'm Sal.
-Nice to meet you.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.153
This is Mrs. Maisel, comedian.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.238
She does five minutes at 2150,
solo act.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.656
-Any props?
-Nope.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.033
-Stand on the "X."
-Okay.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.576
-Mic check.
-One, two.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.119
-MAN: Next.
-Thank you.
-(bell rings)

13:06.161 --> 13:07.871
Oh, uh... okay.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.956
Wait. We dragged ourselves down
here at 8:00 in the morning,

13:09.998 --> 13:11.416
-and that's it?
-That's it.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.876
-I showered.
-Thank you for showering.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.669
We'll see you tomorrow,
1600 hours.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.087
When's that? Wait, Sal.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.923
Things move fast
in the television business.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.091
-Ah, there it is.
-What?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.093
The control room.
Guys down at the deli told me

13:22.135 --> 13:23.762
they're the people
you want to make friends with.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.139
They control things. Come on.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.557
-How long is this guy's act?
-WOMAN: Five minutes.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.975
Does he say anything
or just juggle?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.644
He just juggles, Dickie.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.646
I got to know how high
he's gonna throw those clubs.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.772
Let's see how high
he throws the clubs, Sal.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.190
-Hi, guys!
-Hey, what the hell.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.025
-Who the hell is this?
-What are you doing in here?

13:37.067 --> 13:40.529
-I'm Susie Myerson, manager
to this budding young star.
-Hi.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.113
-Will you get her out?
-He can't throw 'em
that high, Sal.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.532
You'll take good care
of her, boys?

13:43.573 --> 13:44.783
-Go! Go!
-Get the fuck out of here!

13:44.824 --> 13:46.076
Carry on.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.452
God, I hate jugglers.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.454
That was a really good start

13:49.496 --> 13:52.499
on building a rapport
with a key group of guys.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.584
-Oh, my God.
-What?

13:54.626 --> 13:56.044
-MIDGE: Look who's here.
-Who is that?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.504
-MIDGE: Shy Baldwin.
-MAN: Next!

13:57.546 --> 14:00.215
The singer? He's had, like,
a hundred hits in the last year.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.551
That's Shy Baldwin? For some
reason, I thought he was fat.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.679
-MIDGE: Why?
-He sounded fat.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.139
So there's gonna be
some big stars on this thing.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.225
Guess so. (whistles)
I'm getting nervous.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.977
Don't say that.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.770
Just being honest.
I'm getting nervous.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.647
But when you get nervous,
I get nervous.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.315
Don't be a copycat.
Be your own person.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.776
I'm not a copycat.
It's just, you make me nervous.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.279
-Well, then don't follow me.
-We came in the same car.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.614
Then take the subway
if I freak you out so much.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.076
How's your health, Abe?

14:28.118 --> 14:30.954
It's tip-top, Simon. Tip-top.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.832
And Rose? And the kids?
Is everyone well?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.625
Just fine. Why?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.502
Because, Abe, you seem

14:37.544 --> 14:39.796
-to be teetering on the edge.
-That's one man's opinion.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.715
It's actually
a lot of people's opinion.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.967
Who? What people?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.677
Your colleagues, your students,

14:45.719 --> 14:48.638
the administrative staff,
the trustees,

14:48.680 --> 14:50.140
the university senate,

14:50.181 --> 14:52.017
the cleaning crew,
the school doctor,

14:52.058 --> 14:53.768
the school nurse,
the parking attendants...

14:53.810 --> 14:55.520
I don't need
the entire list, Simon.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.273
There are simply a lot of people
disturbed by your behavior.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.026
Disturbed?
That's a strong word, Simon.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.069
Now please,
cut to the chase here.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.572
All right.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.365
Now you eat the cheese?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
We've been sitting here for
ten minutes, and suddenly...

15:09.451 --> 15:10.952
You should consider
a sabbatical.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.370
I have one planned in two years.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.164
Why don't you move it up?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.541
-My colleagues would complain.
-It was their suggestion.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.044
And why would they suggest
such a thing?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.630
Because the parking attendants
told them to?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.923
Are you not listening?
They're sick of you, Abe.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.760
You asked me to cut to the
chase. I'm cutting to the chase.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.720
We're all pretty goddamn
sick of you,

15:28.762 --> 15:31.139
pardon my language.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.567
-Loud.
-Look,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.569
you're a brilliant
mathematician,

15:44.611 --> 15:47.697
but an uncooperative colleague
and a very poor teacher.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.824
-With tenure.
-What about it?

15:49.866 --> 15:51.993
-You can't fire me.
-I don't intend to.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.748
(laughs)

15:56.790 --> 15:59.584
What could possibly be funny
about this, Abe?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.087
I was just thinking
about the irony of tenure.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.756
-What irony?
-Well, for instance,

16:04.798 --> 16:08.343
the fact that I could
take this cheese knife

16:08.385 --> 16:10.553
and stick it in your eye,

16:10.595 --> 16:13.306
and the university would still
have to pay me.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.642
I'd be in jail,
but I'd still be paid.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.436
Are you seriously thinking
of doing that?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.523
No.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.274
You hesitated.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.903
Yes.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.905
I did.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.491
ROSE: Good-bye, Simon.
We'll see you soon.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.037
He's done this before--

16:36.079 --> 16:38.123
this "take a sabbatical"
song and dance.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.958
It's different this time.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.252
And then you say that.
I will fix it.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.421
-I threatened to stab him.
-With a cheese knife.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.465
-It barely cuts cheese.
-Truman didn't even
say good-bye.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.676
Simon's wife loves
that Belgian jelly.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.053
I'll have it shipped.
I'll give it to her,

16:52.095 --> 16:53.638
sweet-talk her,
she'll sweet-talk him,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.975
jelly will be eaten,
all will be well, mm-hmm.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.018
Belgian jelly.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.025
(children chattering)

17:06.067 --> 17:08.737
Ethan,
five-minute warning, kiddo!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.488
Every time he plays tag,
he's "it."

17:10.530 --> 17:12.157
Then he won't chase people
to tag them back,

17:12.198 --> 17:13.616
because he likes being "it."

17:13.658 --> 17:15.452
-It's all kind of pointless.
-BENJAMIN: Hi.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.371
-Benjamin.
-Sorry. I didn't mean to...

17:18.413 --> 17:19.998
It's okay. Hi. Hi.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.333
-Hi.
-Hi. What are you doing here?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.003
I called, and your mother said
you were down here.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.588
Can I sit?

17:26.629 --> 17:28.214
The bench is free to all,

17:28.256 --> 17:29.883
courtesy
of the Parks Department.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.509
CHILD:
You're it!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.303
So... which one's yours?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.346
Oh, gosh,
any one of 'em could be.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.098
I've had a lot
of medical training,

17:37.140 --> 17:39.309
and I don't think that's right.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.727
I'm "it," Mommy.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.687
I'm assuming that's the one.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.981
"Mommy" is a very common moniker
down here.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.524
Swing a dead cat.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.443
This young lady next to me
is "Mommy," as well.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.861
Hi, Mommy.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
Kids can't tell. Too short.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.573
Anyone with a skirt here
is "Mommy,"

17:53.615 --> 17:55.033
and anyone tall, wearing pants

17:55.074 --> 17:56.326
and looking worried about money
is "Daddy."

17:56.367 --> 17:58.453
CHILD:
Well, come on, tag me!

17:58.495 --> 18:00.622
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.582
Is it that you don't want me
to meet Ethan?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.125
He's kind of a jerk.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.753
Just eats and sleeps
and has no job.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.630
-CHILD: You're it!
-(dog barking)

18:08.671 --> 18:10.548
Benjamin, I'm sorry.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.510
This was just... unexpected.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.844
The skin you jumped out of
when you saw me

18:14.886 --> 18:16.137
landed somewhere in Jersey.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.597
I just haven't talked
to their dad

18:17.639 --> 18:19.140
about you meeting the kids.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.851
It would be an issue.
Do you understand?

18:21.893 --> 18:23.978
I do. I don't date many mothers.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.231
This is new for me, too.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.775
CHILD:
You're it! You've got to run!

18:28.817 --> 18:31.611
Let me ask you this. If we were
to, say, get engaged...

18:31.653 --> 18:33.822
-Engaged?
-Engaged.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.741
You'd let me
meet the kids then, right?

18:38.493 --> 18:41.204
"Yes" would be the answer.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.706
Yes.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.750
Okay.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.129
So he's yours--
the one not chasing anybody?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.090
It's complicated.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.759
CHILD: You can just sit here.
You can just tag us.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.427
MIDGE:
Mama, we're back!

18:56.469 --> 18:57.929
Don't run, Ethan.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.430
He needs a bath.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.266
Zelda will draw it for him.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.269
Mama, Benjamin came down
and surprised me at the park.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.145
Oh, how nice.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.273
No, not nice. It was awkward.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.358
I wasn't in the right frame
of mind to see him.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.610
What frame of mind do you
need to be in?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.029
I'm just saying, when Benjamin
calls, just take a message.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.656
Don't give him my longitude
and latitude.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.992
I just said
you were in the park with Ethan.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.827
And if he called
and I was in the bathroom,

19:20.869 --> 19:22.954
would you have him come over and
walk in on me sitting on the...?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.248
-Miriam! Of course not.
-It's the same thing.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.166
Bathrooms and parks
are not the same.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.877
Tell that to a dog.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.129
Is all this
from your comedy routine?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.423
It is now.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.217
(train whistle blows)

19:36.259 --> 19:38.386
Burning the midnight oil.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.971
It's only 11:45.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.639
Take a break.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.350
-I'm close to done.
-Take a break.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.895
Hey, I'm your boss.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.147
Technically, I'm your boss.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.107
We're partnering right now,

19:51.149 --> 19:53.026
but it's still 55, 45.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.570
-Just take a goddamn break.
-Fine.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.572
You know
that stupid building manager

19:57.614 --> 20:00.033
you made me hire
when we bought this place?

20:00.074 --> 20:03.536
The guy just rented out the
bottom floor to a grocery chain.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.164
We're getting triple the rent
I thought we'd get,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.957
plus a cut of sales.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.293
-Guy knows the market.
-Just think of that.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.545
They sell a carrot,
and we get a check.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.757
I never would have known to ask
for that-- a cut of sales.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.383
A building manager knows.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.761
My son did, too.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.309
(clears throat)

20:26.351 --> 20:28.770
That's it? That's the big talk?

20:28.811 --> 20:31.856
Ah. You remember
your bar mitzvah?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.733
The big hall, the three rabbis.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.152
Chopped liver shaped like
Michelangelo's David?

20:36.194 --> 20:37.695
You went all out.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.073
200 people, it added up.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.201
And they all brought cash
as a gift for you.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.496
-Tradition says.
-And I took it all
to pay for the hall.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.581
-You probably don't
remember this.
-I was sitting

20:48.623 --> 20:50.875
next to you when you rifled
through the envelopes, Pop.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.919
-I gave you a cut.
-You gave me a dollar.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.838
-It was a fucking
expensive hall.
-It was a great hall.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.340
I kissed my first girl
in that hall.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.175
-No. Who?
-Letty Zuckerberg.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.760
-With the braces?
-That's why
my mouth was bleeding.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.887
I thought you got into a fight.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.099
Why are you bringing all this
up, Pop? Feeling nostalgic?

21:06.140 --> 21:08.434
I want to give you
that money back.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.895
My bar mitzvah money?
I've forgotten about it.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.730
It's more than that.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.191
There was money for your
high school graduation, too.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.901
You never saw that.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.737
Your college fund-- that paid
for the new steam iron.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.656
-Pop...
-There was money
for your wedding.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.825
Your grandmother left you
some money. You never knew that.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.660
There was a coin collection
from your uncle.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.620
I sold the coins
and kept the money.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.664
Water under the bridge.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.916
I'm working here,
you're paying me well.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.335
-I'm letting you go.
-What?

21:34.377 --> 21:36.129
I don't want you here.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.632
Why? Why are you doing this?
Why now?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.801
So you don't get stuck.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.099
What's this?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.977
Something to soften the blow.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.938
60 grand?

21:53.980 --> 21:56.357
-Yeah.
-Pop, this is a fortune.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.776
-It's-it's a house, it's...
-What I owe you.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.029
Plus interest. Plus guilt.
Plus more guilt.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.115
-Lots of compounded guilt.
-Where'd you get it?

22:04.157 --> 22:06.868
(scoffs) Your mother's not
the only one that hid money.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.662
I don't think all that guilt
adds up to 60 grand.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.206
It does, and now you're free
to do something

22:12.248 --> 22:14.417
that you want to do-- travel,

22:14.459 --> 22:17.170
go to graduate school,
become a beatnik. I don't care.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.130
I'm doing okay here.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.882
A little tired, but I'm...

22:20.923 --> 22:22.967
Not where you should be.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.308
Take your time,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.351
but get the hell out.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.112
-(lively crowd chatter)
-(upbeat music playing)

22:48.201 --> 22:52.413
And we're live
in five, four, three, two...

22:52.455 --> 22:55.333
Hello, and welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

22:55.374 --> 22:57.502
to the Third Annual
Stop Arthritis

22:57.543 --> 23:00.004
and Rheumatism Telethon,
broadcasting live

23:00.046 --> 23:02.381
from New York City.
As you can see,

23:02.423 --> 23:04.592
volunteers are ready
to take your pledges.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.095
That's the phone number flashing
on the bottom of your screen.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.890
Call any time in the next eight
hours to start changing lives.

23:10.932 --> 23:14.560
Stay tuned for an amazing
variety of top-notch performers,

23:14.602 --> 23:17.605
but right now, let's get things
off to an energetic start

23:17.647 --> 23:19.524
with The Phil Donnelly Dancers,

23:19.565 --> 23:22.819
demonstrating the latest
dance craze-- The Bop!

23:22.860 --> 23:25.780

to get the right time.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.387
It's 4:00 in the afternoon now.
Add 12.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.889
That means you're going on
at 4:00 in the fucking morning?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.183
No, that's not right.
I'm on at 2150.

23:54.225 --> 23:58.813
Right. Add 12, which means
you're on at... 3350?

23:58.855 --> 24:01.274
That can't be right, either.
He meant subtract 12.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.401
It's 4:00 now.
If you subtract 12,

24:03.442 --> 24:06.821
that means I go on at...
minus 8:00.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.573
That doesn't make sense, either.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.616

DICKIE: Oy. Get "B"
to stop moving, Hank.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.130
Hold that shot, "B."
Stay right where you are.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.214
Tell "A" to dolly back.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.465
He's about to lose the two
on the left.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.467
Charlie, dolly back a smidge.
You're losing the group.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.928
-Hi, guys.
-You can't be in here!
-(overlapping chatter)

24:30.970 --> 24:32.263
So you may be wondering which
side is my girl's good side.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.389
Well, I'm here to tell you,
there's no bad side.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.724
DICKIE:
Why is "A" still moving?

24:34.765 --> 24:36.517
-Pick an angle.
-And get them the fuck
out of here!

24:36.559 --> 24:39.061
So, she's on around 10:00
to 33 o'clock.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.938
Some shit like that.
We'll check back in later.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.608
-Do not come back here!

The Phil Donnelly Dancers!

25:07.632 --> 25:09.258
Thank you, gang.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.927
Looks like phone calls
are already coming in

25:10.968 --> 25:12.386
from our generous viewers.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.139
Let's check in
with one of our volunteers.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.516
Lulu, tell us about the call.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.936
Yes, Mason.
I just got off the phone

25:19.977 --> 25:22.438
with Ronny Johanssen
from Jackson Heights.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.608
He and his wife Betty
are donating two dollars.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.817
Two dollars!

25:26.859 --> 25:28.402
Thank you, Ronny and Betty.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.112
Your money will go far.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.989
-Folks, let me take some time...
-We gotta talk.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.824
-...right now to discuss
with you...
-Ow. Watch it.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.202
...a true scourge
on our nation's health.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.621
HANK: We'll have "B" and "C"
at stage one for the singer.

25:38.663 --> 25:41.249
-Is he wearing mascara?
-Gets lonely out on the range.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.084
-They're back, guys!
-Get out of here!

25:43.125 --> 25:44.502
You're not gonna believe this.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.295
-What is your problem?!
-Damn it, do something!
-Get out!

25:46.337 --> 25:48.130
-Believe what?
-Get out!
-Who didn't lock the door?!

25:48.172 --> 25:49.882
-Oh, my God.
-It's too loud in here. Come on.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.218
-Yes! Go! Go!
-Get the hell out!
-Get the fuck out of here!

25:52.260 --> 25:53.761
MASON: ...of the joints,
it becomes difficult

25:53.803 --> 25:55.221
to perform everyday tasks.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.473
Many are unable
to climb the stairs...

25:57.515 --> 25:59.225
Susie, what is going on?

25:59.267 --> 26:00.810
Sophie Lennon is here.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.687
-What?
-Sophie fuckin' Lennon.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.480
She was heading
into some dressing room.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.274
-Did she see you?
-She didn't see me.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.192
Why would she perform
on this thing?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.778
Apparently, she's the national
spokes-asshole for arthritis.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.614
-And you didn't know that?
-How am I supposed to know that?

26:13.656 --> 26:15.032
I don't know, you're my manager.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.534
You're supposed to know
these things.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.286
Fred should have told me--
it's his job

26:18.327 --> 26:20.288
-to tell me these things.
-He doesn't work for you.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.706
This is unbelievable.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.833
What do we do? Back out?

26:23.874 --> 26:26.043
We're in too deep.
We'll look like flakes.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.546
Well, she'll probably hole up
in some dressing room

26:28.587 --> 26:30.256
till it's time for her to go on.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.133
There are a million acts.
Let's just lie low,

26:32.174 --> 26:34.218
and she'll never know
we were a part of this.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.553
We were just getting over this.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.847
Kept 'em warm for ya.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.016
MASON: Trudy's
a former high school gymnast...

26:40.057 --> 26:42.643
-He's part of the broadcast?
-I don't know.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.645
It's New York.
Could be a gay hooker.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.647
MASON:
...and basic gymnastic skills.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.317
I'll admit that I choked up
a little when I saw...

26:57.450 --> 26:59.535
So, here I am.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.662
Hi, Pop. This okay?
We could grab a table.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.289
The bar is fine.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.291
What can I get you?
I'm buying.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.044
Sun's still up.
Just a seltzer.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.171
A seltzer, please. Ice.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.382
So?

27:13.424 --> 27:15.634
So, I have a British friend...

27:15.676 --> 27:17.261
MI5?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.721
He uses a phrase

27:18.763 --> 27:20.723
when everything
goes wrong with something.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.558
He says it's gone...

27:22.600 --> 27:23.893
"tits up."

27:23.934 --> 27:25.311
Tits up?

27:25.353 --> 27:28.564
Like an animal lying
on its back,

27:28.606 --> 27:30.566
exposed, incapacitated.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.568
You know, these days,

27:32.610 --> 27:35.529
everyone takes so long
to get to their point.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.823
Your Bell Labs project
has gone tits up, Pop.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.033
It's been canceled.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.368
What?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.953
No one said anything about that.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.082
No one had the guts to.
That's why I'm telling you.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.167
They're just letting you
twist in the wind.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.628
They're hoping you'll leave,
like you're leaving Columbia.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.338
I'm not leaving Columbia.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.131
I don't like what they're doing.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.549
It's disrespectful.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.968
Where did you hear this?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.137
I got a tip from a friend.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.139
They're investigating, Pop.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.849
Investigating what?

28:03.891 --> 28:05.059
You.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.602
Me?

28:06.644 --> 28:08.854
They're going deep
into your background.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.898
I don't understand.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.942
The stuff you did
in your 20s, Pop.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.193
Before you met Mom.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.445
But I did good things
in my 20s.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.739
I was an activist. I cared.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.491
That's part of what
they're interested in:

28:20.533 --> 28:23.035
what you cared about.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.663
What's the precipitating
factor here?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.665
Hang on to your hat.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.542
It's Miriam.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.252
Miriam who?

28:31.293 --> 28:33.045
Your daughter, Pop. Midge.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.089
She was performing
somewhere in D.C.,

28:35.131 --> 28:38.175
and apparently she
started talking about Bell Labs.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.178
And your A.I. project.
There was a guy in the audience,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.431
someone connected to all this.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.433
Then the club caught fire.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.476
She set the club on fire?

28:47.518 --> 28:48.561
No.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.312
I don't think.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.314
I don't believe this.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.900
Believe it.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.736
How can you be so sure?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.281
'Cause the guy who told me...

29:00.322 --> 29:03.242
told me because
I had a gun in his mouth.

29:03.284 --> 29:04.702
My God, no.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.454
Of course not, Pop!

29:06.495 --> 29:08.164
I'm kidding.
Geez Louise.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.957
I can't joke anymore?

29:09.999 --> 29:13.127
It's okay
if you've killed people.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.463
I'm sure they had it coming.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.299
-I don't kill people!
-WOMAN: What did he say?
-(man coughing)

29:18.340 --> 29:21.302
-(quietly): I don't...
I don't kill people.
-MAN: Says he kills people?

29:21.343 --> 29:24.138
I don't even put bullets
in that damn gun.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.640
I understand that
you have to say that.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.060
Look at me, Pop.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.062
I'm an analyst.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.732
I'm a good guy. I'm still me.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.194
I miss you, Pop.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.321
You're my father. I...

29:40.362 --> 29:42.990
I want to get back to normal,
and I don't want you to think

29:43.032 --> 29:44.366
I'm hiding things from you.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.535
That's why I told you
all this today.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.996
I'm... coming clean.

SOPHIE:
Put that on your plate!

30:04.970 --> 30:06.764
I went on a cruise,

30:06.805 --> 30:09.934
and every meal
was all-you-could-eat.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.728
Once I missed breakfast because
I was still eating dinner!

30:12.770 --> 30:15.439
-(laughter)
-If I'd have been
on the Titanic,

30:15.481 --> 30:17.942
I would have gone down

30:19.902 --> 30:22.530
to participate
in a safety demonstration.

-I played the iceberg.

30:26.951 --> 30:29.370
I used to think she was funny,

30:29.411 --> 30:31.664

over and over.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.666
No new take, no spin.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.167
Bullshit.

30:35.209 --> 30:37.336
They say you are what you eat.

Well, that makes me Chinese,

about my new husband?

30:49.431 --> 30:52.768
-AUDIENCE: Yeah!
-Okay! You asked for it!

30:52.810 --> 30:57.022
I told him I wanted him to
make me scream in the bedroom.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.900
So he put a sheet over his head,
cut out two eyeholes

30:59.942 --> 31:01.569
and yelled, "Boo!"

31:03.529 --> 31:06.156
-Put that on your plate!

31:15.708 --> 31:19.086
-one of the guys
who was gonna kill me.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.338
Nice to meet you.
You got a sharp one.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.048
So, what are you doing here?
Rifling purses?

31:23.090 --> 31:25.634
No. I'm doing security
for Sophie Lennon.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.386
-Oh.
-Okay.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.847
It's mostly just asking fans
to step back a little.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.641
I haven't gotten to beat
the shit out of anyone in weeks.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.852

31:39.189 --> 31:41.483
I almost forgot
why I came over here.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.193
Sophie said to say hi.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.321

When the phone rings,
you answer.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.106

Get a name, a number,

32:21.148 --> 32:22.900
a mailing address

32:50.177 --> 32:53.430
Sophie has really pulled in
the dollars for our cause.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.557
We have passed $45,000.

-AUDIENCE: Wow! Whoa!
-And we're still climbing.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.145
As you can see,
our celebrities and volunteers

33:00.187 --> 33:02.940
are hard at work,
taking your calls.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.566
Let's put the number
on the screen again.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.984
We're in the last
few hours, folks,

33:06.026 --> 33:07.528
so dig deep in those pockets

33:07.569 --> 33:09.488
-and help the afflicted.
-What the fuck?

33:09.530 --> 33:11.657
It looks like our
singing cowboy, Waylon Jones,

33:11.699 --> 33:13.450
is rustling up a few pledges.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.412
Let's mosey on over
and chew the chaw with him.

33:16.453 --> 33:19.123
-What the fuck?!
-MASON: Well, you had
a great big smile on your face

33:19.164 --> 33:21.375
during that last call-- who
were you speaking with, Waylon?

33:21.417 --> 33:23.627
Well, Mason,
I was on the horn just now

33:23.669 --> 33:25.462
with a little lady
from Brooklyn.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.089
Her name is Rhonda.

33:27.131 --> 33:29.133
She's nine years old,
and she's giving us

33:29.174 --> 33:31.176
every penny in her penny jar.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.971
-List 'em off, Irene.
-Next hour is Shy,
then Dick Shawn.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.973
-Comedian?
-Comedian. Hour three, we've got

33:36.014 --> 33:38.475
-our folk duo,
our Shakespearean players...
-Hey.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.060
-You can't be in here.
-What the hell?
-Where is security?

33:40.102 --> 33:41.395
I thought I had
a good relationship

33:41.437 --> 33:42.980
with you guys,
but I'm not happy here!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.940
-Get out!
-You can't be in here!
-Call security!

33:44.982 --> 33:47.151
You can't see my fucking girl!
Move the camera over!

33:47.192 --> 33:48.861
It doesn't work that way.
Move your girl.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.821
-Sal put her there.
-Then talk to Sal.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.281
I will. I'll go talk to Sal.
Believe me,

33:52.322 --> 33:53.866
-I'm getting
to the bottom of this!
-Do not come back!

33:53.907 --> 33:55.492
MAN: Who wants to bet
Waylon's from Yonkers?

33:55.534 --> 33:56.952
Well, for starters, I'm fixin'

33:56.994 --> 33:58.787
to put out a new record album.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.498
-I call it One-Horse Town.
-MASON: One-Horse Town?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.083
WAYLON:
Yes, sir. By Waylon Jones.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.169
SAL: Playback should be cued
and ready to go.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.296
-Make sure they know.
-Hey, Sal.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.631
-Shh.
-What the fuck's
with this chair situation?

34:09.673 --> 34:11.842
-My girl's off camera.
-It wasn't my call.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.844
-Whose call was it?
-I don't know. Someone.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.512
-Yeah. Someone.
-While you're at it,

34:15.554 --> 34:18.015
you might want to check
the schedule board, too.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.142
-There's been changes.

It means the world to us
to have so many people care.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.750
Mmm. But your life
has challenges.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.961
Sometimes my arthritis
gets so darn bad,

37:34.002 --> 37:35.796
I'm completely immobilized.

37:35.837 --> 37:36.797
Immobilized?

37:36.838 --> 37:38.215

four, and seven.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.885

People take for granted

38:16.712 --> 38:20.298
driving to the store,
walking up a flight of steps.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.760
I haven't done either one
of those things in years.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.179
I-I can't even...

38:26.221 --> 38:28.682
Can't even what, my darling?

38:28.724 --> 38:31.852
I can't even pick up
my baby grandson.

I have to introduce myself,

39:47.719 --> 39:49.679

39:49.721 --> 39:51.348
Actually, my mother
is your biggest fan.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.100
She even listens
to your Christmas album.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.728
But, oh, my God, Shy Baldwin,
you are phenomenal.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.814
You are amazing.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.816

Where are you supposed to be?

40:03.944 --> 40:05.946
-Ladies' room.
-You're in the right place.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.906
I'm in the wrong place.

40:07.948 --> 40:10.492
You guys have
the bigger mirrors.

40:21.128 --> 40:22.754
-I'm a mother, too.
-Really?

40:22.796 --> 40:25.507
-Mm-hmm.
-You'd never know.

40:25.549 --> 40:28.176
And how are you involved
in all this, honey?

40:28.218 --> 40:29.678
-I'm a comedian.
-Oh, yeah?

40:29.719 --> 40:31.096
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, I love comedians.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.764
Always open my show

Sees the world, tells the truth.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.732
Nothing like that buzz saw
out there.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.485
What buzz saw? Sophie?

40:45.527 --> 40:47.404
Can't stand
that cracker comedy of hers.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.655
She was telling the same jokes

40:48.697 --> 40:49.990
when I was singing
in the subway.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.658
And they weren't fresh then.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.578
I bumped into her in Paris.
I swear,

40:54.619 --> 40:56.413
a dozen diamonds
fell out of her ass.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.331
Your race can have her.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.667

Should've asked that first.

44:16.196 --> 44:18.907
-(fanfare plays)
-(cheering and applause)

44:18.948 --> 44:20.575
Wonderful!

44:20.617 --> 44:22.577
Look at that--
you're following the confetti!

44:22.619 --> 44:24.954
I'm the sweeper!

44:24.996 --> 44:26.706
Are we wrapping early?
It's 11:55.

44:26.748 --> 44:29.125
There's actually one more act.
That girl comedian.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.877
Oh, shit. That's right.

44:30.919 --> 44:33.797
What did this poor woman do
to get this slot?

44:33.838 --> 44:37.425
We thank you for your generosity
and support--

44:37.467 --> 44:39.719
Wait, almost forgot.

44:39.761 --> 44:43.390
Uh, please give
a warm welcome to...

44:43.431 --> 44:46.226
Mrs. Maisel!

44:46.267 --> 44:47.519
-(applause)
-(clears throat)

44:49.437 --> 44:50.897
(Midge clears throat)

44:50.939 --> 44:53.316
(chuckles)
Thank you.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.152
-Thank you, lady and gentleman.
-(audience chuckles)

44:56.194 --> 44:58.488
(grunts) So very professional
of me to come on camera

44:58.530 --> 45:00.323
already laughing,
as if something funny

45:00.365 --> 45:02.242
just happened off camera
that you didn't see.

45:02.283 --> 45:03.993
And you never get to know
what it was.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.745
-(laughter)
-So you're frustrated.

45:05.787 --> 45:08.248
You're tired,
and they've already

45:08.289 --> 45:09.499
blown through the confetti,

45:09.541 --> 45:11.418
so it's nothing
but downhill from here.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.670
-(quietly): Get off. Get off.
-And thanks
to those of you at home

45:13.711 --> 45:15.088
-who are still conscious.
-You're on camera.

45:15.130 --> 45:17.090
And for those of you at home
who aren't conscious

45:17.132 --> 45:18.716
but are still in front
of your TVs,

45:18.758 --> 45:21.553
vote for Kennedy.

45:21.594 --> 45:24.264
Vote for Kennedy.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.099
Was that political?
That was political.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.351
-She can't do that.
-(chuckles) Ballsy.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.353
So, this is the first time
I've ever been on television.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.522
There's no way
you could possibly know that.

45:32.564 --> 45:36.860
Because, you see, television
demands an unerring instinct

45:36.901 --> 45:40.071
for knowing where the camera is,
at all times.

45:40.113 --> 45:41.406
It's not something
you can learn.

45:41.448 --> 45:43.575
It's pure instinct.

45:43.616 --> 45:46.286
So, I am not a singer.

45:46.327 --> 45:49.038
You would know that
if I, well, sang.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.040
I am actually a comedian.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.876
I talk to people for a living.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.669
Not that I'm making a living.

45:54.711 --> 45:56.671
Really, this whole comedian
thing was all just a ruse

45:56.713 --> 45:58.381
to get on this telethon today.

45:58.423 --> 46:02.719
Mason, I'll take that $78,000
now in small bills.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.345
-(laughs)
-Arthritis be damned.

46:04.387 --> 46:05.430
That's right.

46:05.472 --> 46:08.308
This is an extremely
unlikely stickup.

46:08.349 --> 46:11.144
The only witnesses being
some drunk cameramen,

46:11.186 --> 46:14.355
three sailors on leave,
and 14 people half-asleep

46:14.397 --> 46:15.857
in front of their TVs.

46:15.899 --> 46:18.109
-(laughing)
-She's good.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.861
She's a natural.

46:19.903 --> 46:21.446
She's all that.

46:21.488 --> 46:23.198
(audience laughs)

46:23.239 --> 46:25.366
Phones are ringing
and nobody's answering.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.076
Not good.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.496
That's money left on the table.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.790
Come on with me, everybody.

46:32.832 --> 46:35.168
-Let's see
who we've got calling here.
-Excuse us.

46:35.210 --> 46:36.794
Hello and welcome
to the telethon.

46:36.836 --> 46:39.047
Oh, you made a mistake
calling a comedian.

46:39.088 --> 46:41.049
My refrigerator
is not running, sir.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.218
Bye, now.

46:43.259 --> 46:45.053
Hello and welcome
to the telethon.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.305
No, Rabbi,
this is not a good time.

46:47.347 --> 46:49.557
L'chaim.

46:49.599 --> 46:50.642
Hello.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.185
Oh, Mr. Graham Bell.

46:52.227 --> 46:54.354
Thank you so much
for making tonight possible.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.439
Without you and arthritis,
I'd be sitting at home,

46:56.481 --> 46:58.733
bored out of my mind.
Love to Watson.

46:58.775 --> 47:00.151
(laughter)

47:00.193 --> 47:04.155
I was very instrumental
in making this happen.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.573
She's Mrs. Maisel!

47:05.615 --> 47:07.909
Mrs. Maisel is Mrs. Maisel!

47:07.951 --> 47:09.994
She answers phones
and tells jokes.

47:10.036 --> 47:12.288
What can't she do?

47:12.330 --> 47:14.499
I can't talk right now.
I'm on a telethon. Got to go.

47:14.541 --> 47:16.501
(laughter)

47:16.543 --> 47:18.711
Holy fucking Christ.

47:18.753 --> 47:22.048
MIDGE: Hello? Sorry, hard
to hear you over the bongos.

47:22.090 --> 47:23.967
Yes, the telethon will be over
soon, Mr. Belafonte.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.220
Trust me, daylight come
and I want to go home.

47:27.262 --> 47:29.347
Hello, and welcome
to the telethon.

47:29.389 --> 47:30.932
Will I marry you?

47:30.974 --> 47:32.934
Well, how much
are you gonna pledge?

47:32.976 --> 47:34.936
Put in an extra $20
and a Bendel's handbag

47:34.978 --> 47:37.021
and you got yourself a wife.

47:37.063 --> 47:38.690
Hello, and welcome
to the telethon.

47:38.731 --> 47:40.984
Oh, you're downstairs.
Perfect. Hey, can someone

47:41.025 --> 47:43.736
go downstairs and grab
my Chinese food delivery?

47:43.778 --> 47:45.238
-It's two bucks plus tip.
-(neighbors laughing)

47:45.280 --> 47:47.448
Hello. Aunt Hannah.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.034
No, I don't know Eddie Fisher.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.703
Yes, he's on TV sometimes, too,

47:51.744 --> 47:53.746
-but he's not in the TV with me.
-(laughing)

47:55.290 --> 47:57.250
Hello, and welcome
to the telethon.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.252
Moses. Hi. What an honor.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.087
I had no idea
you had arthritis.

48:01.129 --> 48:03.089
So this is really happening.

48:03.131 --> 48:04.507
MIDGE:
...if you took two tablets.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.926
No kidding.
Thank you for your pledge.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.928
-Where do I go now?
-Who's that?

48:08.970 --> 48:10.263
My wife.

48:10.305 --> 48:12.265
-You're married?
-Shh.

48:12.307 --> 48:15.018
MIDGE: No, I'm not interested
in the Encyclopedia Britannica,

48:15.059 --> 48:16.519
thank you.
I started reading it once

48:16.561 --> 48:18.354
and couldn't get through it.
Good-bye.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.607
(laughter onscreen)

48:20.648 --> 48:22.859
Hello, and welcome
to the telethon.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.611
Yes, thank you
for calling to confirm.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.446
I do need a table for 12
at Keens Steakhouse

48:26.487 --> 48:29.115
for tomorrow night.
I'm taking every single person

48:29.157 --> 48:32.118
who's still watching this thing
out for a nice steak dinner.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.037
(cheering and applause)

48:34.078 --> 48:36.664
Take it from there, guys.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.416
Hmm.

48:38.458 --> 48:41.336
Okay, this telethon's
actually gone on so long

48:41.377 --> 48:44.255
we're raising money for
the cameramen's arthritis now.

48:44.297 --> 48:46.549
-(mouthing)
-And now the stage manager's

48:46.591 --> 48:48.092
going like this.

48:48.134 --> 48:50.470
We all know what that means
in show business.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.388
-Whoopee!
-(cheering and applause)

48:52.430 --> 48:53.973
It's whoopee time, everybody.

48:54.015 --> 48:55.308
Everybody make whoopee.

48:55.350 --> 48:56.809
(cheering, whistling)

48:56.851 --> 48:59.187
No, actually, I think
they want me to wrap it up.

48:59.228 --> 49:01.522
Thank you for watching,
everybody.

49:01.564 --> 49:03.941
I'm Mrs. Maisel.
Thank you for giving.

49:03.983 --> 49:06.277
Good night.

49:06.319 --> 49:07.904
(cheering and applause)

49:07.945 --> 49:09.906
Mrs. Maisel, everyone!
That was wonderful.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.325
-Thank you.
-Just wonderful.

49:12.367 --> 49:14.952
Who knew there were people
who were still up?

49:14.994 --> 49:17.705
We've never had
this many calls so late.

49:17.747 --> 49:20.458
We'll keep our phones manned,
so keep calling.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.877
And thank you and...

49:22.919 --> 49:25.922
tune in next year
for our fourth annual

49:25.963 --> 49:28.591
Stop Arthritis
and Rheumatism Telethon.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.009
Good night.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.470
(cheering and applause)

49:34.097 --> 49:35.306
Let's call it a day, guys.

49:35.348 --> 49:36.891
-Bye, Susie.
-See ya, Irene.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.893
Hope my wife stayed up for that.
She'd love it.

49:38.935 --> 49:41.229
-Nice job, guys.
-Make her stick to the script
next time?

49:41.270 --> 49:43.481
-Never.
-Long day.

49:43.523 --> 49:45.483
-We going to the place?
-Sound department's going.

49:45.525 --> 49:47.902
Was it good? I couldn't tell.
I moved a lot.

49:47.944 --> 49:49.404
Was that bad?
Did they hate me?

49:49.445 --> 49:50.988
It was good.
They loved you.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.907
Sal looked mad when I went over
to the phone bank.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.325
Did it work?
Could you hear me?

49:54.367 --> 49:55.827
Trust me, it was great.

49:55.868 --> 49:57.662
It was almost better
that I went on later.

49:57.704 --> 49:59.664
The circumstances were bad,
but the pressure was off.

49:59.706 --> 50:02.208
The day sucked ass, but this
and taking down Sophie...

50:02.250 --> 50:04.544
(clicks tongue) made it all
worthwhile. Let's get a drink.

50:04.585 --> 50:06.546
Whoa, whoa.
Who took down Sophie?

50:06.587 --> 50:07.755
I took down Sophie.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.799
When? Where?

50:09.841 --> 50:10.967
Walked into her dressing room.
By the way,

50:11.008 --> 50:12.135
I'm getting you one of those
next time.

50:12.176 --> 50:14.011
-But why?
-What do you mean, why?

50:14.053 --> 50:15.263
We were gonna let it go.

50:15.304 --> 50:17.181
That stuck-up twat
had it coming.

50:17.223 --> 50:18.808
We were getting past
the whole thing.

50:18.850 --> 50:21.477
Why antagonize her again?
What's the point?

50:21.519 --> 50:23.062
That's the point.
I'm your manager,

50:23.104 --> 50:25.440
and it was time
to fight the fuck back.

50:25.481 --> 50:27.984
We were playing more clubs.
I was on TV.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.610
Let me remind you
that you started this fight.

50:29.652 --> 50:30.862
I'm just finishing it.

50:30.903 --> 50:32.488
We going for that drink?

50:33.531 --> 50:34.741
I'm tired.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.576
Oh, come on.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.035
You can't be serious.

50:38.077 --> 50:40.496
I can't?

50:41.539 --> 50:43.332
Fine. Be like that.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.585
I'll drink enough
for the both of us.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.423
