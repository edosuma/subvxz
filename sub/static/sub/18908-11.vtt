one resource

I miss you *

- Why?

and running.

It's chaos.
- What are you doing here?

18:01.348 --> 18:03.116
- Looking for you.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.751

They just released me.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.755
- And you came here?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.257
- I tried to go home,

18:10.290 --> 18:12.359
but the Occupation
took over our house.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.662

- What attack?

18:17.564 --> 18:20.367
- [sighs]
Your mom.

She's part of the Resistance.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.672

to arrest her,

took everybody to hide.

to get out of here.

to the flats together.

It's not safe here.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.782
- The Green Zone gate.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.951
To get up here.
You have to show ID.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.788

20:21.821 --> 20:24.624
- If they knew who you were,
they would have stopped you.

Because of your mom, your whole
family's on the list now.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.665

21:21.080 --> 21:22.715
- These your kids?

- My son and my nephew.

Look, please,
just let us through the gate.

I drove him up here.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.328

in the back?

my son company.

A pleasure.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.249
Please come in.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.751
- Oh, you have to give

25:18.785 --> 25:20.086
the Governor General's office
credit.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.788
They do provide
excellent lodging

25:21.821 --> 25:24.223
for their out-of-town guests.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.059
- I understand you are now
an out-of-town guest as well.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.260
Yes?

25:28.294 --> 25:30.296
- Technically,
that's true.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.264
- [chuckles softly]

25:32.298 --> 25:35.167
I must admit to a certain
fondness for Los Angeles.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.304
I always loved visiting...
before.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.039
- I share the sentiment.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.675
I've lived here
for a long time.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.815
- You must understand
that I've come to Los Angeles

25:48.848 --> 25:50.883
only to gather information.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.985
Others will be
reaching the conclusions.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.821
- Of course.
I just wanted to be sure

25:54.854 --> 25:56.623
that you had
all the information.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.024
- On what subject?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.692
- Proxy Michael Alcala.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.893
- [laughs]
Oh, please.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.928
Mr. Snyder,

26:01.961 --> 26:04.330
tell me you did not come here

26:04.363 --> 26:07.333

to your former post.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.202
- Oh, I've had
many posts in my career.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.873
"Proxy Governor, Los Angeles"
is not one I care to return to.

26:13.906 --> 26:14.941
- [chuckles]

26:19.311 --> 26:22.181
So the Governor General
sent you here

26:22.214 --> 26:24.316
because she wants
Alcala removed?

26:24.350 --> 26:27.286
- Just think of me
as a concerned citizen.

One with real apprehensions

26:29.155 --> 26:31.824
about the current proxy's
ability to govern the bloc.

26:31.858 --> 26:35.227
- Removing him would reflect
poorly on the Governor General.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.230
- He was her predecessor's
choice, not hers.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.233
- The Los Angeles bloc

26:41.267 --> 26:44.303
needs to start projecting
stability and competence.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.974
Removing yet another proxy
would send the wrong message.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.408

26:49.441 --> 26:53.212
than if this bloc
suffers another disaster?

as an advocate for Los Angeles?

But you need to handle
things on the ground.

nothing that I can do.

The Minister of Intelligence
is next, right?

I'm okay.

29:24.897 --> 29:30.369
*

29:30.402 --> 29:33.005
- Where did you
leave it with King?

29:33.039 --> 29:35.341
- I honestly believed
that we had him as an ally.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.244
- [exhales]

29:38.277 --> 29:42.181
Everything that we built
was just set on fire.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.250
Who knows how the Hosts
are gonna react now?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.819
- Can we trust Alcala
to respond appropriately?

29:46.853 --> 29:47.987
- Of course not.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.221
He called me from his bunker

29:49.255 --> 29:51.057
throwing Homeland
under the bus.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.825
He's happy to drag
everyone down with him.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.928
- Then we need to put him
under your thumb.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.567
Which means
that we need leverage.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.337
- Do you think
that I haven't looked?

30:05.371 --> 30:07.006
- No, I'm sure you have.

30:07.039 --> 30:11.143
But I might know
a way inside.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.313
- How?

30:14.346 --> 30:16.182
- By taking a closer look

30:16.215 --> 30:19.585
at an old friend.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.956
- Nolan Burgess.

30:45.211 --> 30:45.377
.

30:45.411 --> 30:45.912
- I'm worried about Bram.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.884
- Me too, love.

30:51.918 --> 30:55.421
But Dad's gonna find him.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.124
- We shouldn't stay here.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.425
- Why not?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.160
- What if Bram gets caught?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.529
- He's not gonna get caught.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.630
[dull thud]

31:12.939 --> 31:14.373
Shh.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.189
[suspenseful music]

31:30.222 --> 31:37.229
*

32:17.536 --> 32:21.073
Everyone's out
looking for you.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.642
Your father,
Morgan, Broussard...

32:23.675 --> 32:28.981
*

32:29.015 --> 32:31.550
- [sniffles]
I'm sorry.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.490
- Where did you go?

32:38.524 --> 32:40.292
What were you doing?

32:43.529 --> 32:45.164
Okay, come on.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.538
Come on.
- [crying]

32:52.571 --> 32:59.611
*

33:03.282 --> 33:06.718
- I got you.
- [exhales]

33:30.776 --> 33:33.079
[door opens]

33:38.317 --> 33:42.054
- Is Bram okay?

33:42.088 --> 33:43.755
- He's home.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.594
You go hang out with Charlie
for a minute, okay?

33:48.627 --> 33:50.329
I got to talk to your brother.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.464
- Okay.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.799
- Thanks.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.839
[somber music]

34:00.872 --> 34:07.346
*

34:07.379 --> 34:09.148
[sighs]

34:16.522 --> 34:19.858
- Do you think
I'm a good person?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.793
- Bram.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.665
What happened?

34:28.434 --> 34:30.869
- I made a mistake.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.139
I shouldn't have gone.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.410
- Listen.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.379
Whatever happened up there,

34:40.412 --> 34:42.514
it doesn't...

34:42.548 --> 34:45.217
matter.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.618
But I need to know

34:46.652 --> 34:49.655
so that we can...

34:49.688 --> 34:52.824
make it right.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.094
[footsteps approaching]

34:58.697 --> 35:00.132
- Is he here?

35:00.166 --> 35:02.401
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.370
Are you trying
to get us all killed?

35:04.403 --> 35:05.537
- Will.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.838
- He's lucky to be alive.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.407
Even luckier
he didn't get caught.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.509
- I know, but he wasn't.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.244
- It's a war zone out there.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.413
There are Redhats
and drones everywhere.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.581
- What happened?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.183
- Attack on the Green Zone.

35:17.216 --> 35:20.319
The Red Hand,
apparently.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.388
They went house to house
like the Mansons.

35:22.421 --> 35:23.722
It was a massacre.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.258
Where the hell
are you going?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.560
- Bram?

35:28.594 --> 35:30.262
- They killed everyone!

35:31.863 --> 35:32.864
- Who did?

35:32.898 --> 35:35.867
- The RAPs.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.170
After we blew up the ship,

35:38.204 --> 35:39.805
they hit the camps
with some kind of weapon,

35:39.838 --> 35:41.673
and it just disappeared.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.176
- You blew up the RAP ship?

35:44.210 --> 35:46.178
- We did it together.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.213
Me and Maya and the others.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.581
My friends.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.317
- The Red Hand
are your friends?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.185
- They're murderers.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.586
They're the ones
that attacked our house.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.588
They tried to kill
your brother and sister.

35:56.622 --> 35:57.889
- Because you were
a collaborator.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.591
- I collaborated
to keep us alive!

35:59.625 --> 36:01.593
- Hey! Stop it! Enough!

36:01.627 --> 36:03.595
- They wanted to make
a difference.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.565
To stand up.
They wanted to fight.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.338
- He did this because of you.

36:12.371 --> 36:19.411
*

36:26.017 --> 36:28.754
- Bram, I need to know
what happened.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.857
- [gasping]
I don't know.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.933
- You went up
to the Green Zone.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.670
You were part of the attack.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.807
- Yeah.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.780
- You went to someone's house.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.615
- [breathing heavily]

36:56.648 --> 36:58.817
- Were you alone?

37:01.987 --> 37:04.656
- I was with Patrick,

37:04.690 --> 37:07.426
and there was a guy
in the house.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.429
- Did Patrick hurt him?

37:13.532 --> 37:15.767
- He had a gun,
and he killed Patrick.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.839
- So you killed him?

37:25.711 --> 37:27.913
- I wanted to,
but I couldn't.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.916

37:58.910 --> 37:59.277
.

37:59.311 --> 37:59.945
- I appreciate the visit,
Alan.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.450
- I appreciate you taking
the time, Mr. Ambassador.

38:04.483 --> 38:05.617
Thank you.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.811
Echo-tango-null.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.780
- How can I assist you,
Mr. Ambassador?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.715
- I need a secure line.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.919
I will send
my preliminary report tonight.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.856
And we will speak more
when I return.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.018
This is Ambassador King again.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.086
I think I'm in danger.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.688
[line beeps]

39:16.722 --> 39:18.023
- This is
the Security Directorate.

- Uh, yes,
I'm in the Green Zone

39:19.425 --> 39:20.826
of the Los Angeles bloc.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.127
Something is happening.

39:24.763 --> 39:25.997
- House two-four-zero.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.466
- All right, Mr. Ambassador.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.567
Stay with me.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.569
I'll get you through this.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.704
- There's someone
on the property.

[suspenseful music]

39:38.877 --> 39:40.946
- All right.
I'm in the master.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.682
- There's a safe.
Do you see it?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.851
- Yes, I see it.

39:45.884 --> 39:50.689
- The safe's code is
enter-one-six-five-enter.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.424
- I'm in.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.859
- There's a shotgun
and a box of shells.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.994
Take them out.
Move to the first floor.

There's a secure room

I want you to load the shotgun.

Take a shell.

Holding the brass end,
push it into the loading flap
