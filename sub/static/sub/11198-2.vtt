<i>Previously on "Stargate SG-1":</i>

00:10.520 --> 00:13.200
- Do you not recognise us, Daniel?
- I'm sorry.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.840
You were a member of my team, SG-1 .
You're a friend of mine.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.040
- We are in position to ambush Anubis...
- Do not question me. Do as I say!

00:21.120 --> 00:24.400
<i>(Carter) Activating hyperdrive.</i>

00:28.720 --> 00:31.720
<i>(O'Neill) Target is locked. Fox 4-2.</i>

00:36.880 --> 00:41.000
- You will suffer gravely.
- I won't tell you anything.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.120
Yes, you will.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.400
<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

00:53.640 --> 00:57.640
- Receiving lDC, sir. It's SG-1 .
- Open the iris.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.920
Colonel. Major.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.760
Our mission was a success. Anubis's
new weapon has been neutralised.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.240
Well done.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.320
- What about Jonas and Dr Jackson?
- Still on the ship.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.560
- Anubis went into hyperspace.
- Do we have any idea where they went?

01:22.640 --> 01:24.840
No, sir.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.800
You appear to be unharmed
by the mind probe.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.160
I appreciate the concern.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.040
You seem calm,
considering some lowly humans

01:46.120 --> 01:50.680
just put a serious crimp
in your plans for galactic domination.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.640
Your insolence amuses me.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.080
I've learnt many valuable things
from you, Jonas Quinn.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.600
I now know Dr Jackson
accompanied you aboard this ship.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.480
- Do you know where he is?
- He continues to elude our sensors,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.880
but his time is running out.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.800
- Nothing you learnt from me'll help you.
- Oh, we will see about that.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.280
Have a look out the window.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.600
<i>(Jonas) We dropped out of hyperspace.</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:31.000
I'm eager to find out more about
this powerful variation of naqahdah

02:31.080 --> 02:33.520
discovered on your planet.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.280
I believe you call it "Naquadria".

02:37.800 --> 02:39.400
Where are we?

02:39.480 --> 02:42.680
Welcome home, Jonas Quinn.

04:00.760 --> 04:06.200
I just got a report from the Tok'ra. They've
no news on the location of Anubis's ship.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.000
- What about Teal'c?
- We can only assume he's with Yu's fleet.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.440
Any idea why they didn't show?

04:13.520 --> 04:16.839
- I could make a guess.
- You think Yu hung us out to dry?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.240
I'm not gonna touch that, sir.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.200
- I don't think he made a deal with Anubis.
- Trust a Goa'uld, this is what you get.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.200
I understand how you feel,
but I approved this operation

04:27.280 --> 04:31.720
because I believed it was our best chance
to deal Anubis a crippling blow.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.280
<i>- Yes, sir.
- (man) Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

04:44.840 --> 04:47.760
Receiving a radio signal, sir.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.840
<i>This is Ambassador Dreylock
of the Kelownan High Council.</i>

04:50.920 --> 04:53.320
General Hammond of Stargate Command.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.440
<i>We request immediate assistance.
We are under attack.</i>

04:56.520 --> 05:01.320
We've been over this. We can't interfere
in the internal affairs of your planet.

05:01.400 --> 05:07.400
<i>You don't understand. We are under
attack from a Goa'uld called Anubis.</i>

05:11.840 --> 05:13.640
<i>(O'Neill sighs)</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:33.600
Why have I been detained?

05:36.680 --> 05:38.480
Lord Yu is without honour.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.760
- Shol'va!
- Jaffa!

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
Kree jel-na.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.400
We had an agreement.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.080
You have not been betrayed.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.880
Not deliberately.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.160
I do not understand.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.280
My master is not well.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.000
He spends most of his time
in the sarcophagus. He is there even now.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.320
Why does he not take another host?

06:16.400 --> 06:19.600
I believe he has reached the point
where he is incapable.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.400
Lord Yu is the oldest of the System Lords.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.360
He has reigned for countless centuries,

06:27.440 --> 06:31.600
but now I'm beginning to fear
that even gods cannot live forever.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.640
Lord Yu is not a god.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.720
Once I would have struck you down
for speaking those words.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.800
But now?

06:45.240 --> 06:49.080
He was convinced that Anubis
was in the Chodawa system.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.280
And even though I knew this was
not the case, I could not contradict him.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.880
But you have seen that
Lord Yu can make mistakes.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.320
He has become increasingly
paranoid and confused.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.040
He speaks to himself,
but his words make no sense.

07:07.120 --> 07:14.280
He forgets key details of our attack plans,
and grows angry when I remind him.

07:14.360 --> 07:19.240
If what you say is true,
you and your Jaffa are in grave danger.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.600
- You must do something.
- I cannot betray him.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.880
I have devoted my life to his service.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.560
If this continues,
Lord Yu's empire will fall.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.240
Millions of Jaffa will die.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.800
Lord Yu will be remembered as a fool.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.080
What meaning will your life have then?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.240
- Have they agreed to help us?
- Not yet.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.800
Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.480
- Ambassador. Commander.
- Thank you for coming.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.080
- What's going on, kids?
- A ship is hovering over the city.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.880
Alien troops have taken
the capitol building and other positions.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.360
Where are we?

08:24.440 --> 08:29.240
This bunker is several hundred feet below
an army base on the outskirts of the city.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.760
The communicator should work.
It can transmit from Tok'ra tunnels.

08:32.840 --> 08:37.280
- I don't understand.
- Two of our people may be on that ship,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.360
one being Jonas Quinn.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.320
Daniel?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.800
Daniel, come in. It's O'Neill.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.440
<i>Daniel?</i>

08:50.760 --> 08:53.560
- Jack?
- What's your situation?

08:56.600 --> 09:00.360
- I'm hiding. What's yours?
- Carter and I are on the planet.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.960
Be more specific. I haven't had
a chance to look out a window.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.840
- You're hovering over Jonas's home.
- Why?

09:07.920 --> 09:10.680
I wish I knew.
Are you in any immediate danger?

09:10.760 --> 09:13.200
Depends on what you mean
by "immediate".

09:13.280 --> 09:15.440
<i>- Daniel.
- I'm fine.</i>

09:15.520 --> 09:20.200
I got a location on Jonas's cell,
but first I've got a couple of problems.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.920
Like what?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.480
I'm not sure how to shut off
the force field protecting his cell yet.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.480
You said a couple?

09:28.560 --> 09:33.560
Yeah, actually, I'm a little lost.
And I've only got about three hours left

09:33.640 --> 09:37.360
before the Tok'ra isotope wears off
and I'm visible to the sensors.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.280
- So business as usual then, huh?
- I don't know. Is it?

09:43.240 --> 09:49.080
- Yes, we do this kind of thing all the time.
- Oh, well, good. That's comforting then.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.640
This is a mistake.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.400
Lord Yu can no longer be permitted
to command the opposition to Anubis.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.720
His Jaffa will follow your orders
in his name, but others will not.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.200
We need the combined force
of the System Lords.

10:06.280 --> 10:10.440
- None of them can be trusted.
- Nonetheless, one must be chosen.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.720
<i>(beeping)</i>

10:12.800 --> 10:15.400
The signal is coming through.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.240
- What is the meaning of this?
- Lord Baal...

10:24.320 --> 10:28.560
Where is your master? Why do you
allow this shol'va to appear before me?

10:28.640 --> 10:32.400
- I am here to present an offer.
- I will not listen to a traitor.

10:32.480 --> 10:38.160
Then you will miss an opportunity
to rid yourself of Anubis forever.

10:40.280 --> 10:44.520
When the ship appeared,
we were caught completely off guard.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.280
There was widespread panic.
Before we knew what was happening,

10:48.360 --> 10:52.440
most of the High Council
had been taken hostage.

10:52.520 --> 10:57.040
When we wouldn't give in to his demands,
Anubis had the First Minister executed.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.640
He also fired a volley
into our industrial sector,

11:00.720 --> 11:06.400
destroying several factories
and killing many innocent citizens.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.120
After that, we gave him what he wanted.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
- Which was?
- Naquadria.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.440
Our entire stockpile.

11:18.520 --> 11:23.240
Commander. We're receiving
a transmission from the surface.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
Excuse me a moment.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.920
Anubis must've used that mind probe on
Jonas and found out about the Naquadria.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.600
Then he knows the stuff
only works half the time.

11:36.680 --> 11:41.680
Just cos we can't establish a stable power
output doesn't mean he won't. If he does...

11:41.760 --> 11:44.640
Tadada-dah, ta-dah!

11:53.560 --> 11:58.440
The truth is my master is no longer fit
to lead the forces of the System Lords.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.280
How dare you judge your god?

12:01.360 --> 12:04.200
The shol'va has poisoned your mind.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.480
Clearly, Lord Baal is not interested.

12:06.560 --> 12:11.600
- We should contact another System Lord.
- Hm. Perhaps Bastet.

12:11.680 --> 12:16.800
If I assume command, how can I be
assured of the loyalty of Yu's troops?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.360
They will follow me in his name.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.040
And will you obey me?

12:21.120 --> 12:24.560
The destruction of Anubis
is in my master's best interest.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.200
I will support any action
that leads to this goal.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.000
If you are in agreement, I must contact
the Tauri to make the final arrangements.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.200
Then do so.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.400
Take me to the nearest Stargate.

12:59.360 --> 13:04.840
Commander, you said you gave Anubis
your entire stockpile of Naquadria.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.520
That's correct.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.080
So if he got what he wanted,
why is he still here?

13:09.160 --> 13:10.760
I have no idea.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.840
His men have rounded up archaeologists
from the Academy of Sciences.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.120
- He may be looking for the Stargate.
- How secure is this place?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.200
It's top secret.

13:20.280 --> 13:24.600
We had the gate moved here after the
Tiranians and Andaris began air strikes.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.480
<i>So you did go to war?</i>

13:26.560 --> 13:30.120
Yes, but we managed
to negotiate a cease-fire.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.120
I thought you were
outgunned and outmanned.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.320
We used the Naquadria bomb.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.640
On people?

13:41.720 --> 13:46.800
We instantly regretted it. The devastation
was beyond anything we'd imagined.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.160
<i>(Commander) As many Kelownans
would have died had we done nothing.</i>

13:51.240 --> 13:54.840
We were faced with our own destruction
and you refused to help us.

13:54.920 --> 13:59.200
And, as awful as it was, it managed to
bring Tiranians and Andaris to the table.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.360
Delegates had just arrived
in the city for peace talks.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.080
- Do they know about the Stargate?
- No.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.320
They may have noticed
the rather large ship floating in the sky.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.040
- You might as well tell them the rest.
- We were hoping it wouldn't come to that.

14:14.120 --> 14:18.160
Anubis has everything he came for.
He may just leave.

14:18.240 --> 14:22.160
If Anubis can figure out how to overcome
the instability of the Naquadria,

14:22.240 --> 14:25.520
it will give him a significant advantage
over all his enemies.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.920
- He's gonna want more.
- There is no more. The mine is dry.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.440
You think he'll take your word for it?

14:32.520 --> 14:36.760
He will occupy this planet and
enslave your people. We've seen it before.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.040
What can we do?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.040
If you want to fight, we'll help you.

14:45.120 --> 14:50.720
But we need the cooperation
of the other major powers on this world.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.480
My lord, I have completed
a preliminary analysis of the Naquadria.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.280
The potential energy output
is greater than that of regular naqahdah.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.840
It will be hard
to maintain a stable reaction.

15:11.920 --> 15:17.200
This ship must have full power again.
I will not accept failure.

15:18.160 --> 15:23.480
My lord, we've already learnt all we can
from Jonas Quinn. Why keep him alive?

15:23.560 --> 15:27.920
His physiology merits
further experimentation.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.760
He may still prove to be very useful.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.720
<i>(whispers) Jonas.</i>

16:16.800 --> 16:19.200
Jonas, are you there?

16:19.280 --> 16:22.120
- Daniel?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

16:22.200 --> 16:25.320
Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you?

16:26.160 --> 16:31.160
I'm in a storage room
about 20 feet from your current position.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.760
- Can you get me out of here?
- I'm working on it.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.960
Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter,

16:41.040 --> 16:44.960
may I present the leaders of the
Tiranian and Andari peace delegations.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.560
Ambassador Sevaarin
and Ambassador Noor.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.320
Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter
represent a planet called Earth.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.800
They don't look very alien.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.080
We get that a lot.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.440
And this, of course, is the Stargate.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.599
- How does it work?
- Let's have a look.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.839
Something like that.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.760
- Incredible.
- Isn't it?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.319
He is one of the enemy soldiers.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.720
Relax. He's one of ours.

17:27.599 --> 17:31.360
- It is good to see you both again.
- We got your message from Hammond.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.920
- Are you nuts?
- I believe it to be our only choice, O'Neill.

17:39.400 --> 17:45.360
I don't know quite how to tell you this, but
Anubis has taken the ship to your home.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.600
We're above the Kelownan capital.

17:47.680 --> 17:53.000
I know. He wants Naquadria. If it wasn't
for me, he'd never have found out about it.

17:53.080 --> 17:58.120
- Don't blame yourself.
- The point is l joined Stargate Command

17:58.200 --> 18:01.520
so maybe one day I could
protect my planet from the Goa'uld.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.840
- Instead, I brought them right to it.
- We'll find a way out.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.400
- Yeah?
- Apparently.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.360
We already trusted one Goa'uld.
Look where it got us.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.840
I do not trust Baal, O'Neill,

18:15.920 --> 18:21.200
but I believe, at least for the moment,
his goal is the same as ours.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.440
<i>(sighs)</i>

18:23.520 --> 18:26.120
All right. Have at it.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.640
Oh, yes, you do the talking.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.080
We have made an agreement
with another System Lord named Baal.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.880
If we give him your location,
he will bring a fleet and destroy Anubis.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.240
You propose to bring
more of these Goa'uld to our world?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.440
For now, Anubis is vulnerable.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.680
He has but one ship and is preoccupied,
but believes his position to be secure

18:54.760 --> 18:57.960
because he knows the other lords
are unaware of this place.

18:58.040 --> 19:02.520
And if Anubis is destroyed, how
do we know this Baal will leave us alone?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.760
That is part of the agreement.

19:06.800 --> 19:12.000
You say we cannot negotiate with Anubis
and these Goa'uld cannot be trusted.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.600
And yet you ask us to trust another?

19:14.680 --> 19:18.760
<i>- Your world faces an imminent threat.
- (Sevaarin) Kelowna faces the threat.</i>

19:18.840 --> 19:23.080
There are no alien ships
in the skies above Tirania.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.840
See what we have to deal with?

19:25.920 --> 19:31.640
Haven't you guys ever heard the story
of the dog and the dancing monkeys?

19:31.720 --> 19:36.840
Has something to do with
getting along and... dancing.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.160
Carter.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.560
With all due respect, Mr Ambassador,

19:45.640 --> 19:50.040
when Anubis comes looking for more
Naquadria, he won't respect any borders.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.640
He will tear this planet apart
piece by piece if he has to.

19:53.720 --> 20:00.040
I won't approve any plan unless I have
unanimous agreement from all parties.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.320
My lord.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.760
Have you found a way
to overcome the Naquadria's instability?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.440
I believe I have.

20:13.520 --> 20:19.600
Then use it to power one of the ship's
weapons arrays. I want it tested now.

20:19.680 --> 20:24.360
- We will need to select a target.
- How fortunate there is a city before us.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.080
I am unsure of the power of this weapon.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.840
The blast radius from one shot
could encompass the entire city.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.240
If it does,

20:33.320 --> 20:36.640
you will have my congratulations.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.120
<i>Daniel, this is Sam. Come in.</i>

20:50.760 --> 20:52.760
- Go ahead.
- Did you find Jonas?

20:52.840 --> 20:55.960
Yeah. I'm still having trouble
with the force field.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.840
<i>You're gonna have
to find a way to cut the power.</i>

20:58.920 --> 21:03.080
- How do I do that?
- Unsure. We've two hours to figure it out.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.120
<i>- What happens then?
- Baal's fleet arrives.</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:11.480
I've got 15 minutes till this isotope wears
out and I'm visible to the ship's sensors.

21:11.560 --> 21:15.360
I'll have to get back to you.
I've got company.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
Kel nor shol ak'ra.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.400
Reltac.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.560
Tel shek anfar, tel nor moklan n'ral.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.480
Jaffa!

21:37.720 --> 21:39.560
Sarit.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.000
Naquadria generator is online.
We are ready.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.680
Charge the weapon.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.960
- My lord, the generator is overloading.
- Abort the test.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.960
I cannot abate the overload.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
Jaffa, kree!

22:53.960 --> 22:57.520
This makes no sense.
I compensated for the instability.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.080
Kill him!

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
<i>(thud)</i>

23:14.600 --> 23:16.840
Jonas!

23:16.920 --> 23:19.000
- What happened?
- I don't know.

23:19.080 --> 23:24.160
Whatever it was, there's not enough
power to maintain the force fields.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.840
Agh!

23:25.920 --> 23:28.120
- You OK?
- That hurt.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.600
- Your arm?
- A little numb.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.280
I think I can make it.

23:33.360 --> 23:38.040
You better. I don't want to have to
take you out of here in a dustpan.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.040
<i>(moans)</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:43.920
Nice.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.800
- How do we get off this thing?
- Cargo ship.

23:46.880 --> 23:50.560
- Which way?
- Uh... this way.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.880
- You sure?
- No.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.160
Right.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.240
- Report.
- We're in position,

24:01.320 --> 24:05.560
but the Kelownans want more troops
to deal with the Jaffa on the ground.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.600
I can't authorise that
without Pentagon approval.

24:08.680 --> 24:15.200
Yes, sir, but I was thinking maybe I could
take SGs 15 and 1 1 as technical advisors.

24:15.280 --> 24:19.440
- What if Baal doesn't show up?
- Could get a little screwy.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.440
But we talked these folks into this.
The least we can do is back 'em up.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.440
- Agreed. Put your teams together.
- Sir.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.320
Anubis has superior shields,

24:28.400 --> 24:33.320
but our intelligence says they're less than
40% effective in a planet's atmosphere.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.160
If Baal attacks while Anubis is weak,
he has a chance.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.040
That's not very reassuring.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.080
We just heard Anubis's men
are ransacking the Museum of Antiquities.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.200
- Why would they do that?
- They may still be looking for the gate.

24:46.280 --> 24:51.000
No. Anubis is smart enough to know
that it wouldn't be in a public place.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.080
- What was in the museum?
- Nothing.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.840
The exhibit was put into storage
when the war began.

24:55.920 --> 25:01.000
- OK, what was in the exhibit?
- Trinkets from the original Goa'uld sites -

25:01.080 --> 25:04.560
- pottery, statues.
- What about tablets?

25:05.480 --> 25:07.640
Those were classified top secret

25:07.720 --> 25:11.280
and given to the scientists
working on our Naquadria project.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.720
I'd like to see a list of exhibit objects.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.560
Anubis is looking for something.
I wanna know what.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.320
Cargo bay should be down the next hall.
How's your arm?

25:22.400 --> 25:24.400
I can wiggle my fingers.

25:29.480 --> 25:34.880
Those were all the Jaffa going into
the cargo bay, which is just down the hall.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.520
Eight men!

25:46.720 --> 25:49.120
That's all you brought?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.640
<i>Eight good men.</i>

25:52.720 --> 25:56.320
There are over 1 ,000 alien soldiers
in the city.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.600
Their weapons are more powerful
than anything our forces have ever seen.

26:00.680 --> 26:04.720
- We don't stand a chance.
- The main problem is the ship.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.640
Once that's taken out,
we can deal with the Jaffa.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.480
Sir, I think I know
why Anubis hasn't left yet.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.200
He's looking for a crystal.

26:14.280 --> 26:18.200
The Kelownan archaeologists found it,
but they didn't know what it was.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.920
They classified it as a decorative object
and put it in the museum.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.120
I don't understand. What is it?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.800
The Goa'uld use crystals
to store information.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.720
What information?

26:28.800 --> 26:33.920
The original Goa'uld who occupied this
planet was experimenting with Naquadria,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.480
but there are no details -
no lab notes, no test results.

26:37.560 --> 26:41.120
- You think that's what's on the crystal?
- It makes sense.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.640
Your people, not knowing its importance,
never included it with the other material.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.840
That's why Jonas never knew of it.

26:47.920 --> 26:53.240
Sir, if Anubis gets ahold of this crystal, he
could use it to make the Naquadria work.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.080
Yeah, I get it.

26:56.160 --> 27:00.760
- Where is it?
- Everything was moved to a warehouse.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.440
- I can take you there.
- Wait!

27:04.000 --> 27:08.960
If this is as important as you say, let me
send a contingent to secure the building.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.920
We don't want to draw
any unnecessary attention to the place.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.680
I'll go, sir. I know what to look for.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.760
All right. Take Teal'c.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.840
<i>(footsteps)</i>

28:03.640 --> 28:05.920
Looks like patrols are closing in.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.480
And we've got one minute
before the isotope wears off.

28:12.480 --> 28:17.480
That planet you guys found me on was
nice - people were simple, life was quiet.

28:17.560 --> 28:21.440
- Why didn't you stay?
- I couldn't remember what this was like.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.280
It's fun, isn't it?

28:23.360 --> 28:25.360
Yeah.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.160
- If we get out of this...
- You can keep the office.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.720
Actually, I was talking about SG-1 .

28:32.560 --> 28:36.080
You took the position cos
you felt guilty about what happened to me

28:36.160 --> 28:38.880
and thought you'd make up for it
by finishing my work...

28:38.960 --> 28:43.120
- I love the job.
- Who'd argue? Bad hours, constant peril.

28:43.200 --> 28:47.240
On the bright side,
you do get to travel a lot.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.600
- You're very up.
- Yeah.

28:53.320 --> 28:59.360
Truth is, I don't think that Colonel O'Neill
was very comfortable having me around.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.560
That's not what he told me.
He said you were a good man.

29:02.640 --> 29:07.720
- Really? He said that?
- Yeah. You're shocked he never let on?

29:09.720 --> 29:12.360
Anyway, now that you're back...

29:12.440 --> 29:15.760
Let's worry about getting out of here first.

29:15.840 --> 29:19.400
- Rings?
- What good's that? Nowhere to ring to.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.080
We found a ring platform
when we found the gate.

29:22.160 --> 29:28.240
- So it hasn't been used in 2,000 years.
- Well, let's see if it still works.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.760
Looks like we got here first.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.800
Jaffa, kree!

30:03.880 --> 30:10.160
Two unauthorised personnel detected
on sensors approaching your sector.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.840
- This is hopeless.
- It has to be here somewhere.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.560
Major Carter.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.760
Bingo.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.320
Jaffa, kree!

30:48.760 --> 30:50.520
Shel-norak.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.200
- Do we know where it is we're going?
- Not a clue.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.920
Gal a'quel.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.720
Argh!

31:34.240 --> 31:36.240
- Nice timing.
- Thanks.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.440
- Jonas Quinn.
- Ambassador.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.120
- Where are we?
- Warehouse,

31:41.200 --> 31:44.760
where they keep Goa'uld artefacts,
including a ring platform.

31:44.840 --> 31:49.840
- And a crystal.
- Let's go. There's more Jaffa on our tails.

31:53.880 --> 31:58.840
<i>Perimeter's clear. We've a visual on Major
Robbin's position across the square.</i>

31:58.920 --> 32:02.120
OK, Sergeant. Sit tight. O'Neill out.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.200
<i>- (Carter) Colonel.
- Hey.</i>

32:07.080 --> 32:11.080
- Where'd you find them?
- They dropped into the warehouse.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.640
- Nice. The crystal?
- Right here.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.840
I'll take that.

32:16.920 --> 32:22.520
- I think it'd be better if we held onto it.
- I'm afraid I must insist.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.840
What is this?

32:46.920 --> 32:49.360
I've made a separate arrangement.

32:53.720 --> 32:59.560
Put down your weapons, Colonel,
or I will be forced to destroy these people.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
The crystal.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.520
You're an idiot, you know that?

33:22.600 --> 33:27.240
In exchange for this, Anubis has agreed
to leave Kelownan territory untouched.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.400
Thus confirming my last statement.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.480
He knows our Naquadria supplies
are depleted,

33:33.560 --> 33:37.120
but I believe he may find
another mine on Tiranian territory.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.200
That's a lie.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.920
One of your scientists is a Kelownan spy.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.400
You've been trying to build a bomb
for the last three years.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.640
But we didn't mine the Naquadria.
We stole it from the Andaris.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.120
What?

33:51.200 --> 33:54.440
Don't you see what's happening here?

33:54.520 --> 33:56.880
- He's using you against each other.
- Enough!

33:56.960 --> 34:01.440
You can't afford to fight. This planet
is a target, not just Kelowna or Tirania.

34:01.520 --> 34:05.280
- You have to stand together.
- I said enough!

34:12.840 --> 34:16.800
You've gotta start trusting each other,
or you're all gonna become slaves.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.920
If you're lucky.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.280
The crystal.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.719
Thank you.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.880
As for the rest of you,

34:51.960 --> 34:58.640
you'll be publicly executed, as an example
to all those who would defy their god.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.360
Does it have to be publicly?

35:09.400 --> 35:11.400
I could kill you now.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.080
Publicly's fine.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.440
Jaffa!

35:52.440 --> 35:54.480
Aargh!

36:02.600 --> 36:04.600
Tel nor, hatak mal shee.

36:34.880 --> 36:38.240
Your ship is at my mercy.
You are defeated.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.320
Surrender now.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.800
Jaffa, kree!

36:57.880 --> 36:59.720
Daniel!

37:02.160 --> 37:03.560
Argh!

37:16.200 --> 37:18.200
Jonas!

37:21.280 --> 37:23.080
Agh!

37:24.360 --> 37:26.480
I owe you one.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.000
We'll call it even.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.160
The last time you returned to Kelowna,
you were considered a traitor.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.840
- That will not be the case this time.
- Are you sure?

37:53.920 --> 37:57.680
The Andaris and Tiranians
only participated in a joint ruling council

37:57.760 --> 38:00.520
on condition you were
the Kelownan representative.

38:00.600 --> 38:07.160
Your year's experiences will be vital to our
planet facing what awaits in our future.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.240
We need you, Jonas.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.480
Got everything packed?
Toothbrush, slippers, hair gel?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.200
Yes.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.600
Sir.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.800
- It was an honour, son.
- Yes, it was.

38:30.600 --> 38:36.040
When we first met you told me that
the issues between my planet's nations

38:36.120 --> 38:41.600
would seem insignificant once I found out
what was really going on up there.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.920
- Yeah, I remember that.
- You do?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.800
- Yeah.
- That's great.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.440
It's all kind of coming back.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.360
- I'm glad I had the chance to find out.
- Me, too.

38:58.440 --> 39:02.120
You have the heart of a warrior,
Jonas Quinn.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.600
Continue to fight well.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.200
Keep in touch.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.240
Uh...

39:19.320 --> 39:21.520
You earned it.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.360
Thanks.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.600
Hey, Daniel.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.680
Feed my fish?

40:16.640 --> 40:19.040
- You all right?
- Yeah.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.600
Well, dinner's at seven. Don't be late.

40:23.680 --> 40:28.480
Teal'c gets a little cranky
when his blood sugar gets low.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.360
- Jack.
- Yeah?

40:31.440 --> 40:36.600
It's not that I mind rejoining SG-1
and exploring the galaxy,

40:36.680 --> 40:42.520
meeting new cultures, jeopardy,
saving the world - that kind of thing.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.200
We get paid for this, right?

40:49.400 --> 40:51.800
Welcome back.
