01:38.866 --> 01:41.867
But are you sure
week off from work?

01:41.869 --> 01:42.868
Of course I can.

were enough weekends

02:42.863 --> 02:44.196

09:07.848 --> 09:09.814
I had the strangest dream.

09:09.816 --> 09:13.151
I dreamt I was addicted
to energy pills.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.855
Hmm. I seem to have been
accidentally tied to the bed.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.857
We had to protect
you from yourself.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.625
Your dream was real.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.127
Was it? Hey,

09:22.129 --> 09:24.195
give me my pills
out of my jacket.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.997
You're not
having any pills.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.098
You're an addict!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.934
Donna, I'm not an addict.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.536
Now, if you wouldn't mind
reaching into my anus

09:31.538 --> 09:33.338
and fetching me
my private reserve.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.472
Ain't happening, Brown.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.840
We're having
an intervention.

09:35.842 --> 09:39.611
Yeah? You and what army
of family and nosy neighbors?

09:39.613 --> 09:40.979
LESTER: Us.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.514
Oh.

09:42.516 --> 09:43.949
What's up, Arianna?

09:43.951 --> 09:48.086
(whispers): Would you reach
into my anus for me?

09:51.657 --> 09:53.758
I'm sorry
it's come to this.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.427
You're going to rehab.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.797
♪ I say no, no, no.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.532
Winehouse. Dead. Sad.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.367
Didn't see it coming. Did.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.002
Cleveland, we
want you better.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.838
And we'll be here for you
when you get out of rehab.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.774
B-But I won't
know anyone there.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.842
You know what?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.177
I think it'd be a good idea

10:12.179 --> 10:14.346
if Tim dried
out a bit.
(slurping, belches)

10:14.348 --> 10:15.981
And Lester, too.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.949
He's an alcoholic.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.685
I'm just addicted to
seeing you pretty.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.021
(hiccups)
Oh, Lester!

10:23.023 --> 10:25.023

the same smocks!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.333
We don't belong here.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.135
I mean,
look at all these weirdoes .

10:37.137 --> 10:39.504
I sold my penis for meth.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.973
I got drunk and had sex
with my boss's car.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.042
I huff propane.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.845
And the worst part is,
I only took those pills

10:46.847 --> 10:49.614
so I could go
on that Commodores Gold Record

10:49.616 --> 10:52.017
and All-You-Can-Eat
Jumbo Shrimps Cruise.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.985
And now I can't go.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.420
Just don't think
about it, C-bro.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.689
Kind of tough not
to think about it.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.861

guys looking at?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.929
No, Shrimpy Dave,
don't look!

11:04.931 --> 11:06.031
Is that shrimp?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.266
I'm off the wagon!

11:08.268 --> 11:09.434
Ew.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.002
I thought he'd be eating it.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.271
Lord, help Shrimpy Dave.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.975
(slaps)
Ow!

11:16.977 --> 11:18.510
Ha-ha! Boom!

11:18.512 --> 11:19.844
You suck!

11:19.846 --> 11:21.980
Yeah, this is better
than a cruise.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.615
I know
you're disappointed,

11:23.617 --> 11:26.317
but we should be here
in case Cleveland needs us.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.853
Even though our bags
are already packed

11:28.855 --> 11:32.657
and our non-refundable tickets
are right there.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.926
And that taxi's waiting outside.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.995

'Ey!

11:36.997 --> 11:39.431

11:39.433 --> 11:42.000
Well, we could just take a ride
in the cab with our bags,

11:42.002 --> 11:43.468
see where it goes.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.871
We at least owe it to our bags
to put them in the cab.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.173
Screw it, let's go.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.044
I guess everything I do
is for him,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.680
just to hear him say,
"I'm proud of you."

11:55.682 --> 11:56.848
Your father?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.583
No, Bradley Cooper.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.085
Well, we've made some progress.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.820
You guys are out of your minds.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.121
I'm going to take a shower.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.422
Anybody want to take a shower?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.691
All right.
I do.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.959
This is ridiculous.

12:07.961 --> 12:08.927
I don't belong here.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.161

12:11.530 --> 12:13.431

12:13.433 --> 12:14.833
We're getting out of here.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.801
And here's how...

12:16.803 --> 12:20.138
CLEVELAND: <i>The orderlies' shift</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:40.625
Holt, this is
where you come in.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.960
You're gonna create
a diversion.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.194
Can I do Church Lady?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.029
Don't care.
I'm gonna do Church Lady.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.584
Totally up to you.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.986
Sorry, Cleve-bro.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.687
We're staying.
What?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.675
You should be so lucky.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.644

water by Somali pirates.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.180

who isn't of use to them,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.420

any singles open or...

14:18.792 --> 14:19.958

need this frail, old man.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.663
Well, that was
a stupid move.

here tomorrow?

And maybe this time,
a little less raping.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.497

18:19.665 --> 18:22.133
Oh, Cleveland!

18:22.135 --> 18:25.169
So, you decided to go on
the cruise without me, huh?

18:25.171 --> 18:26.804
Well, to make it up to me...

18:26.806 --> 18:28.806
Roberta, cover your ears.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.876
I want two oral sins
when I want them,

18:31.878 --> 18:34.946
even after a flight,
and no reciprocals.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.014
Get us out of this,
and you can have one

18:37.016 --> 18:39.917
with no reciprocals
and three egg cracks.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.018
Mm.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.987
Can I have an
egg crack now?

18:42.989 --> 18:44.122
Crack.
Ooh...

18:44.124 --> 18:47.492
Oo-hoooo, there's egg
all down my shoulders.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.526
Shiver.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.794
So gooey.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.028
Okay, stay here,
I'll be back.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.296
(shudders):
Oooh...

18:52.298 --> 18:53.931
That was a delayed one.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.766
Nice. Hm-m-m.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.035
(gunfire)

19:03.308 --> 19:05.009
(woman screams)

19:05.011 --> 19:06.043
(gunfire)

19:16.822 --> 19:18.623
We're doomed.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.024
Hi, Daddy... Dad.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.192
Sorry, son.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.460
I can't save us.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.961
I don't have the energy.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.696
Wait, my pills!

19:25.698 --> 19:27.165
Junior, would you
reach in my anus?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.299
Sure!

19:28.301 --> 19:31.102
Wait, let me check
my pocket first.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.685
(groans)

19:47.687 --> 19:48.686
(gun cocks)

19:48.688 --> 19:50.922
Any last puns or wordplay?

19:50.924 --> 19:53.157
You've heard
of pirating cable,

19:53.159 --> 19:56.761
but how about
cabling a pirate?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.305
You have defeated us.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.306
Have I?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.373
Yes! Ugh!

20:09.375 --> 20:10.841
I hate you!
Do you?

20:10.843 --> 20:11.943
Ahh!

20:11.945 --> 20:13.945
(ship's horn blares)

20:15.881 --> 20:18.616
Cleveland, you really
saved the day.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.652
Maybe I was wrong
about you taking those pills.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.821
I hope so, 'cause
I haven't stopped.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.822
Are you serious?

20:24.824 --> 20:27.058
Y-Yeap-a!

20:32.030 --> 20:33.965
Anybody know how
to play the guitar?

20:33.967 --> 20:36.267
♪ Thanks for the time
that you've given me ♪

20:36.269 --> 20:37.835
♪ The memories all in my mind

20:37.837 --> 20:39.604
♪ You're once, twice,
three times ♪

20:39.606 --> 20:40.738
♪ La, la, la-laaaaaaaa!

20:41.940 --> 20:42.873
(splashing)

20:42.875 --> 20:44.875
(Cleveland barking)

20:44.877 --> 20:46.310
(frantically chewing gum)

20:46.312 --> 20:48.112
Hey, I'm Cleveland Brown,

20:48.114 --> 20:50.414
and we had a good time
tonight-igh-igh-igh,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.984
and we talked about addiction
which is no laugh-- (laughs)--

20:52.986 --> 20:54.986
laughing matter,
which is why I'm back here

20:54.988 --> 20:57.655
telling you all this and we
killed a pirate and whatnot,

20:57.657 --> 21:00.424
but please,
addiction <i>no bueno es</i> bad.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.993
C-Bro, we going
to that party?

21:01.995 --> 21:03.494
You betcha!
