00:14.531 --> 00:15.531
Problem?

00:16.534 --> 00:18.309
- This is Thai food.
- Here we go.

00:20.283 --> 00:23.087
We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

00:23.217 --> 00:25.350
Yes, but we all agreed
that the third Thursday

00:25.475 --> 00:27.991
of every month would be
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

00:28.116 --> 00:30.401
Apparently the news didn't
reach my digestive system,

00:30.526 --> 00:32.436
which, when startled,
has it's own version

00:32.561 --> 00:34.532
of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

00:35.950 --> 00:38.477
Come on, the whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday

00:38.602 --> 00:40.952
is to get out of this rut
we've been in lately.

00:41.077 --> 00:43.539
"Rut"?
I think you mean "consistency."

00:43.664 --> 00:46.472
And if we're going to abandon that,
then why even call it Thursday?

00:46.597 --> 00:50.577
Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide it
into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece,

00:51.219 --> 00:54.505
and celebrate it by sacrificing
a goat to the mighty god Ra.

00:56.992 --> 00:58.742
I could go for some goat.

01:00.976 --> 01:04.105
Sheldon, we agreed
we'd do something different tonight.

01:04.584 --> 01:07.317
All right.
Let's go to the comic book store.

01:07.486 --> 01:08.985
We went there last night.

01:09.196 --> 01:11.646
Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic book night.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.073
Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday,

01:14.241 --> 01:16.679
because it's
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

01:18.010 --> 01:21.313
Way to think outside
but pressed right up against the box.

01:22.197 --> 01:24.133
So what are we going to do tonight?

01:24.258 --> 01:26.008
If I may proffer a suggestion,

01:26.133 --> 01:28.631
in bars all across
this great nation of ours,

01:28.756 --> 01:30.907
Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.408
Which means,
as the evening progresses,

01:33.533 --> 01:36.159
we will get better looking
courtesy of 99 cent margaritas

01:36.284 --> 01:38.162
and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

01:40.699 --> 01:42.185
Come on, Howard, the odds of us

01:42.429 --> 01:44.728
picking up girls in a bar
are practically zero.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.190
Really? Are you familiar
with the Drake Equation?

01:47.358 --> 01:49.134
The one that estimates
the odds of making contact

01:49.259 --> 01:50.754
with extraterrestrials
by calculating the product

01:50.879 --> 01:52.878
of an increasingly restrictive
series of fractional values

01:53.003 --> 01:54.372
such as those stars with planets,

01:54.497 --> 01:56.204
and those planets
likely to develop life?

01:56.329 --> 01:58.265
N equals R times FP
times NE times FL

01:58.390 --> 02:00.176
times FI times FC times L?

02:04.014 --> 02:05.264
Yeah, that one.

02:10.877 --> 02:13.339
You can modify it
to calculate our chances

02:13.464 --> 02:15.885
of having sex by changing
the formula to use the number

02:16.124 --> 02:17.545
of single women in Los Angeles,

02:17.670 --> 02:19.927
the number of those who might
find us attractive,

02:20.052 --> 02:22.640
and what I call
the Wolowitz Coefficient.

02:23.739 --> 02:25.144
"The Wolowitz Coefficient"?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.612
Neediness times dress size squared.

02:29.589 --> 02:31.810
Crunching the numbers,
I come up with a conservative

02:31.935 --> 02:35.405
5,812 potential sex partners
within a 40-mile radius.

02:35.984 --> 02:37.073
You're joking.

02:38.353 --> 02:40.248
I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.194
I never joke about math or sex.

02:45.811 --> 02:48.204
What are we waiting for?
Let's bounce, bitches.

02:50.194 --> 02:51.129
You're right.

02:51.599 --> 02:54.981
It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!

02:55.177 --> 02:56.973
Here we go.
Lock up your daughters!

02:57.098 --> 02:59.220
We're going to hit it and quit it.

03:05.408 --> 03:08.563
Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

03:09.279 --> 03:10.629
Also a good plan.

03:11.621 --> 03:14.444
But next Anything Can Happen Thursday,
we're definitely going to a bar.

03:14.649 --> 03:15.754
Absolutely.

03:16.071 --> 03:19.622
You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies?
We're eventually coming for you!

03:23.271 --> 03:24.371
Fascinating.

03:46.581 --> 03:48.311
Subtitles: The FW Team

03:51.598 --> 03:54.101
- Hey, guys. Where're you headed?
- To the comic book store.

03:54.226 --> 03:57.215
You're probably thinking,
"The comic book store? On a Thursday?

03:57.340 --> 04:00.640
Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole
and into a land of madness."

04:00.909 --> 04:02.663
What you have failed
to take into account,

04:02.788 --> 04:05.499
is that this is
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

04:07.211 --> 04:08.261
You got me.

04:09.021 --> 04:11.793
While you're there, could pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

04:12.175 --> 04:14.149
I think you mean comic books.

04:14.274 --> 04:17.464
"Comics" are feeble attempts at humor
featuring talking babies

04:17.634 --> 04:19.148
and anthropomorphized pets

04:19.273 --> 04:22.861
found traditionally in the
optimistically-named "funny pages."

04:24.217 --> 04:26.897
Could you pick me up a few comics
for my nephew's birthday?

04:27.022 --> 04:28.347
Sure. What does he like?

04:28.472 --> 04:30.602
I don't know, he's 13.
Just pick out anything.

04:30.772 --> 04:32.522
"Just pick out anything"?

04:33.595 --> 04:36.904
Maybe we can pick out a new suit
for him without knowing his size.

04:37.029 --> 04:39.529
Or pick out his career for him
without knowing his aptitude.

04:39.697 --> 04:43.496
Or pick out a new breakfast cereal
without knowing his fiber requirements.

04:44.342 --> 04:46.881
Or his feelings
about little marshmallows.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.834
- Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
- <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>,

04:51.959 --> 04:54.003
<i>Ultimate Spider-Man,
Spectacular Spider-Man,</i>

04:54.128 --> 04:57.422
<i>The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man,
Spider-Man 2099</i> ?

04:59.157 --> 05:02.510
You know this can go on all night.
Why don't you just come with us?

05:03.653 --> 05:05.853
That's what I was trying to avoid.

05:07.010 --> 05:09.110
I forgot <i>Sensational Spider-Man</i>.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.523
What a cute, little store.

05:19.364 --> 05:21.164
Everybody's staring at me.

05:23.194 --> 05:26.117
Don't worry, they're more scared of you
than you are of them.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.369
Unlikely.

05:31.526 --> 05:33.626
Here, what about this one
for my nephew?

05:33.751 --> 05:35.792
- A superb choice.
- Oh, great.

05:36.125 --> 05:39.313
Provided he has already read
<i>Infinite Crisis</i> and <i>52</i>,

05:39.438 --> 05:42.674
and is familiar with the
reestablishment of the DC multiverse.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.762
What's a "multiverse"?

05:46.428 --> 05:47.928
Get her out of here.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.641
Come on, I'll help you
pick something.

05:53.115 --> 05:54.960
That's right. She's with us.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.690
Guys like that are so pathetic.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.184
Tell me about it.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.282
Look, a new Batman belt buckle.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.287
Hey, Leonard.
Can I help you find something?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.872
Hey, Stuart. This is Penny.
She's looking for some comic books.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.041
Oh, really.

06:14.286 --> 06:17.086
Blink twice if you're here
against your will.

06:18.473 --> 06:20.161
I think we're fine, Stuart.

06:20.286 --> 06:23.036
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

06:24.559 --> 06:26.302
He seems like a nice guy.

06:27.249 --> 06:29.387
You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

06:30.898 --> 06:32.531
I just meant for... yeah.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.313
Just because people appreciate
comic books doesn't make them weirdos.

06:37.653 --> 06:39.064
Stuart's a terrific artist.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.234
He went to the Rhode Island
School of Design.

06:41.564 --> 06:42.972
What about the guy over there

06:43.097 --> 06:45.488
in the superhero T-shirt
tucked into his sweatpants?

06:47.514 --> 06:49.409
Yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.662
He doesn't really help
the point I'm trying to make.

06:56.881 --> 06:59.190
- Got it. Got it.
- Got it. Got it.

07:10.636 --> 07:11.689
Need it!

07:14.584 --> 07:15.518
Let it go.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.310
Why? I saw it first.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.857
- Yes, but I saw it from the front.
- A far less impressive feat.

07:21.026 --> 07:23.907
Come on! I need this
for my Batman collection.

07:24.056 --> 07:27.028
- I need it for my Robin collection.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?

07:27.198 --> 07:29.321
Why would I gamble?
It's mine. Let go.

07:29.446 --> 07:30.811
- You let go.
- No, you!

07:30.936 --> 07:31.814
Problem?

07:31.939 --> 07:34.537
- He won't let go of my comic book.
- It's my comic book!

07:34.706 --> 07:35.955
We need a ruling.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.624
Cut it in half?

07:39.875 --> 07:41.626
- Excuse me.
- Hello again.

07:41.926 --> 07:45.046
Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

07:46.058 --> 07:47.508
A 13-year-old girl.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.031
But if you're dead set
on a comic book, try...

07:53.016 --> 07:53.890
this.

07:54.214 --> 07:56.309
<i>Hellblazer</i>.
What's this about?

07:56.477 --> 07:58.408
A morally ambiguous confidence man

07:58.589 --> 08:00.254
who smokes, has lung cancer

08:00.379 --> 08:02.998
and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.986
If it doesn't make me the favorite aunt,
I don't know what will.

08:10.268 --> 08:11.615
Is this me?

08:13.262 --> 08:14.824
Depends. Do you like it?

08:15.215 --> 08:17.787
- It's really good.
- Yes, that's you.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.292
That's so sweet,
but what if I didn't like it?

08:22.695 --> 08:24.995
It'd still be you,
but I'd feel like an idiot.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.176
I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

08:30.671 --> 08:33.179
I have got to learn how to draw.

08:35.902 --> 08:39.292
Once again, defeated
by your own prurient interests.

08:39.932 --> 08:43.366
Guys, have you seen Stuart
all up in Penny's business over there?

08:43.751 --> 08:47.222
Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

08:47.811 --> 08:49.694
Okay, you've got my number.

08:49.864 --> 08:52.615
- Now, give me the picture.
- You drive a hard bargain.

08:53.496 --> 08:54.742
But here.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.870
All right.
So, just give me a call.

09:00.820 --> 09:04.520
So, Leonard, how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

09:09.501 --> 09:11.745
Look at that.
That's a dent.

09:13.808 --> 09:16.358
Thank you,
Howard "Ham-Fisted" Wolowitz.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.550
Did you just shut the TV off
in the middle of the classic

09:22.675 --> 09:24.981
Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series

09:25.106 --> 09:27.442
"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode?

09:29.051 --> 09:30.251
Apparently so.

09:31.924 --> 09:33.024
Are you ill?

09:35.773 --> 09:36.859
All right.

09:37.423 --> 09:39.542
Then is it fair to say
that you're experiencing

09:39.667 --> 09:41.852
some sort of emotional turmoil
over the events

09:41.977 --> 09:44.104
involving Penny
earlier this evening?

09:44.229 --> 09:46.179
When did you pick up on that?

09:47.381 --> 09:49.915
A moment ago, when you turned off the TV
during the classic

09:50.040 --> 09:51.896
<i>Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series</i>

09:52.021 --> 09:53.925
"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode.

09:57.876 --> 09:59.807
Would you like some advice?

10:00.974 --> 10:01.935
Sure, why not?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.660
Then, this is the perfect
time to launch a blog

10:04.785 --> 10:07.204
with an interactive
comments section.

10:08.907 --> 10:09.942
Thanks a lot.

10:11.286 --> 10:13.194
Would you rather I offer
my personal insight?

10:13.628 --> 10:15.377
I don't need any insights.

10:15.502 --> 10:18.817
I just want to know why Penny's
more interested in Stuart than me.

10:18.942 --> 10:20.881
We're practically the same guy.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.835
I disagree.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.959
Stuart is taller,
artistic, self-employed

10:26.411 --> 10:30.122
and, most significantly,
he gets 45 percent off comic books.

10:35.257 --> 10:38.700
You're right. I really should be
asking strangers on the Internet.

10:40.194 --> 10:41.713
My original point.

10:44.569 --> 10:47.723
Chinese food, vintage video games...

10:48.005 --> 10:50.631
After the nightmare of
Anything Can Happen Thursday,

10:50.756 --> 10:53.680
this is Friday night
the way it was meant to be.

10:54.831 --> 10:56.781
Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?

11:01.757 --> 11:03.329
Hey, Penny...
and Stuart.

11:06.195 --> 11:08.249
- Hey, guys.
- So what are you kids up to?

11:08.622 --> 11:11.002
Stuart has a piece in an art show
that's opening tonight.

11:11.172 --> 11:14.215
And you guys are going together.
Great...

11:14.697 --> 11:15.797
It is great.

11:15.922 --> 11:17.071
Really great.

11:17.196 --> 11:18.546
Freaking awesome.

11:19.687 --> 11:21.601
- What are you guys doing?
- It's Friday night,

11:21.726 --> 11:23.681
Chinese food and vintage
video games, right?

11:24.010 --> 11:26.935
Vintage doesn't even begin
to describe what we have planned.

11:27.060 --> 11:30.996
Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980
interactive text adventure, Zork.

11:32.696 --> 11:34.596
It's the buggy beta version.

11:36.261 --> 11:38.071
Zork. Well, you guys have fun.

11:39.186 --> 11:41.373
- See you guys.
- See you, Stuart.

11:41.759 --> 11:42.883
Hey, Howard?

11:44.461 --> 11:46.347
Take me to a bar with women.

11:47.327 --> 11:48.624
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:53.229 --> 11:55.724
Let me just go inside
and slip off my underwear.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.136
Why?

12:00.573 --> 12:04.518
Well, if I get lucky, I don't want
to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.

12:06.510 --> 12:07.809
Do you...? Let's go.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.288
May I have a grasshopper
with a little umbrella, please?

12:17.834 --> 12:19.821
- No, he may not.
- Why?

12:20.202 --> 12:21.719
I'm not sitting here with a guy

12:21.844 --> 12:24.481
drinking a grasshopper
with a little umbrella.

12:25.647 --> 12:28.330
Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.

12:29.904 --> 12:31.041
Wrong again!

12:31.644 --> 12:33.177
You know I can't talk to women

12:33.302 --> 12:36.197
unless I'm lit up
like the Hindu festival of Devali.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.714
There are plenty
of bars in Los Angeles

12:42.839 --> 12:44.991
where you can order grasshoppers
and chocolate martinis,

12:45.116 --> 12:48.686
but you wouldn't have to
because there are no women in them.

12:49.714 --> 12:50.714
Gotcha.

12:52.276 --> 12:54.231
I'll have a Brandy Alexander.

12:55.713 --> 12:58.931
All right, the Three Musketeers
just became the Dynamic Duo.

12:59.636 --> 13:02.019
Should we talk
to some of these women?

13:02.144 --> 13:04.032
It's way too early
in the night for that.

13:04.401 --> 13:08.309
First we let the lawyers and the jocks
thin the herd, and then...

13:08.526 --> 13:10.959
we go after the weak
and the old and the lame.

13:12.839 --> 13:14.087
That's your system?

13:14.212 --> 13:15.562
That's my system.

13:17.466 --> 13:20.090
And if you spot a chick
with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.

13:24.591 --> 13:26.278
Come on. I think it's nice

13:26.403 --> 13:29.534
that Captain Sweatpants
showed up to your art opening.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.854
Yeah, it would have been nicer
if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

13:36.779 --> 13:38.466
You know, it's kind of early.

13:38.591 --> 13:40.610
Do you want to maybe come in
for some coffee?

13:41.250 --> 13:43.947
Gee, it's a little late
for coffee, isn't it?

13:45.656 --> 13:48.535
You think "coffee," means coffee.
That is so sweet.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.663
Come on. I think I have decaf.

13:52.467 --> 13:53.415
Good, Stuart.

13:54.028 --> 13:56.252
I thought I heard your voice.
Do you have a moment?

13:56.587 --> 13:59.087
- Yeah, I guess.
- Sheldon, we're a little busy, so...

13:59.632 --> 14:01.918
- What are you doing?
- We're having coffee.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.509
Isn't it a little late for coffee?

14:05.404 --> 14:07.262
It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.211
I'll just go look for it.

14:14.968 --> 14:17.557
- What's up?
- I've spent the last three hours

14:17.682 --> 14:20.221
in an online debate
in the DC Comics Batman chatroom,

14:20.346 --> 14:23.781
- and I need your help.
- Yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.637
- What's the topic?
- I am asserting,

14:25.762 --> 14:27.915
in the event
that Batman's death proves permanent,

14:28.040 --> 14:29.970
the original Robin, Dick Grayson,

14:30.095 --> 14:31.994
is the logical successor
to the Bat Cowl.

14:32.549 --> 14:35.540
Sheldon, I'm afraid
you couldn't be more wrong.

14:40.599 --> 14:41.666
More wrong?

14:44.658 --> 14:48.574
Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.535
Of course it is. It's a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.

14:52.660 --> 14:55.321
It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.

14:57.263 --> 15:00.565
But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing,

15:00.735 --> 15:02.150
a superhero in his own right.

15:02.474 --> 15:05.028
Batman 2 has to be
the second Robin, Jason Todd.

15:05.679 --> 15:07.946
Has to be? Has to be?

15:08.973 --> 15:11.576
I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.

15:12.784 --> 15:14.648
- I found the decaf!
- Great!

15:14.773 --> 15:16.647
Herbal tea for me, please.

15:20.473 --> 15:21.473
Barkeep!

15:21.773 --> 15:23.049
Alexander me.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.288
How about those two?

15:27.344 --> 15:28.598
They're eating peanuts.

15:28.723 --> 15:32.293
And my allergies, one kiss would put me
in Cedars-Sinai for a week.

15:34.912 --> 15:36.979
What about the ones in the corner?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.854
Possible. Very possible.

15:40.527 --> 15:43.962
You want the one in the whiplash collar
or the one who keeps blinking?

15:44.787 --> 15:46.387
I think Blinky's cute.

15:46.599 --> 15:47.899
You got it, sir.

15:48.101 --> 15:50.151
Wait, so we just go over there?

15:50.853 --> 15:52.851
We have a little prep work to do.

15:52.976 --> 15:56.163
Put this in your mouth.
We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.391
I say, sorry,
my friend's had a little too much.

15:58.516 --> 16:01.412
And then I start
to pull it out of your mouth.

16:01.850 --> 16:04.116
And say, "A little too much fun."

16:06.129 --> 16:06.923
Get it?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.104
They're laughing, we're laughing.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.603
Then we get them up
to about a .15 blood alcohol level,

16:11.728 --> 16:13.388
and tell them we're millionaires.

16:15.604 --> 16:17.004
What else you got?

16:17.540 --> 16:19.248
Depends. Are you
willing to sit on my lap

16:19.373 --> 16:21.438
and pretend to be
a ventriloquist dummy?

16:23.185 --> 16:26.138
I can't sit on your lap.
You don't know the routine.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.958
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck
in a pre-<i>Zero Hour</i> DC universe.

16:33.147 --> 16:34.159
Of course I am.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.716
Removing Joe Chill as the killer
of Batman's parents

16:36.841 --> 16:39.039
effectively deprived him
of his <i>raison d'être</i>.

16:40.354 --> 16:43.418
Throw all the French around you want,
it doesn't make you right.

16:44.043 --> 16:45.193
<i>Au contraire.</i>

16:47.042 --> 16:49.882
Plus, you're forgetting
that the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> storyline

16:50.051 --> 16:52.231
restored Joe Chill
to the Batman mythology.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.763
I am forgetting nothing
and I resent your tone.

16:57.753 --> 17:00.226
Look, Sheldon, it's late.
I've got to get some sleep.

17:00.542 --> 17:02.646
- So, I win.
- No, I'm tired.

17:03.795 --> 17:04.924
So, I win.

17:06.545 --> 17:08.981
- Fine. You win.
- Darn tootin', I win.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.767
Penny, I really had
a terrific time...

17:15.970 --> 17:17.285
No, don't wake her.

17:17.981 --> 17:20.290
She'll maul you
like a rabid wolverine.

17:23.547 --> 17:25.894
You know, I don't think
that was decaf.

17:29.859 --> 17:32.290
Wait. Is this your card or isn't it?

17:36.046 --> 17:37.972
Trust me. This was their card.

17:38.234 --> 17:39.808
I thought you were good at this.

17:40.483 --> 17:43.061
You're always talking about
how you go to bars and meet women.

17:43.547 --> 17:44.997
I do, all the time.

17:45.173 --> 17:47.612
Well, what happened?
We've been sitting here all night

17:47.737 --> 17:51.296
and the longest conversation you've had
with a woman was when your mom called.

17:57.422 --> 17:59.577
You're just going to make me
come out and say it?

18:00.233 --> 18:01.162
Say what?

18:01.549 --> 18:03.249
You're weighing me down.

18:05.984 --> 18:09.170
I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

18:09.834 --> 18:13.716
Fine. I'll sit here.
You take flight and hunt.

18:15.176 --> 18:17.887
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't tell a falcon when to hunt.

18:18.738 --> 18:20.138
Actually, you can.

18:22.239 --> 18:24.686
There's a whole sport
built around it.

18:26.174 --> 18:27.341
Falconry.

18:30.926 --> 18:31.926
Shut up.

18:32.943 --> 18:35.096
Let's just get Koothrappali and go.

18:41.277 --> 18:42.687
Lucky bastard.

18:45.801 --> 18:47.708
It's got to be
that stupid accent of his.

18:51.053 --> 18:53.715
Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz
from Bombay.

18:56.741 --> 18:58.141
Okay, I'm stumped.
