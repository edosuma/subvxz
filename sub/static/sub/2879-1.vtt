<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.359 --> 00:06.360
OTHERS: We now pronounce you
husband and wife!

00:09.559 --> 00:11.811
(loud rumbling)
I love this part!

00:11.813 --> 00:13.396
Me, too!

00:13.398 --> 00:16.866
I have strongly mixed feelings!

00:18.635 --> 00:21.620
So, Howard's really
in space, huh?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.522
Mm-hmm, International
Space Station.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.624
250 miles that way.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.411
Right now, Howard's
staring down at our planet

00:28.413 --> 00:31.964
like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

00:31.966 --> 00:35.034
Zeusowitz.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.319
SHELDON:
I must admit,

00:36.321 --> 00:38.871
I can't help
but feel a twinge of envy.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.558
He can look out the window and
see the majesty of the universe

00:42.560 --> 00:44.677
unfolding before his eyes.

00:44.679 --> 00:48.381
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

00:50.434 --> 00:54.487
It's like a cat
in an airport carrying case.

00:54.489 --> 00:57.573
You know, it's not exactly
glamorous up there.

00:57.575 --> 00:59.608
The water that
the astronauts drink

00:59.610 --> 01:02.161
is made from each other's
recycled urine.

01:03.413 --> 01:04.846
Must be nice.

01:04.849 --> 01:07.750
Nobody wants anything
that comes out of <i>me.</i>

01:12.589 --> 01:15.541
(sighs): I wonder what he's
doing right this very second.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.427
Mm, conducting experiments
in zero gravity.

01:18.429 --> 01:20.880
Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

01:20.882 --> 01:24.316
Whatever it is, we know his
life will never be the same.

01:24.318 --> 01:28.354
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
<i>Howard! Can you hear me?!</i>

01:28.356 --> 01:32.141
I can hear you
<i>without</i> the phone!

01:32.143 --> 01:33.592
Don't be snippy.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.228
I'm just excited to talk
to my baby!

01:36.230 --> 01:38.731
I'm excited to talk to you, too.

01:38.733 --> 01:41.617
So, what's this <i>mishegas</i>
about you moving out

01:41.619 --> 01:44.787
to go live with
the little Polish girl?!

01:44.789 --> 01:47.490
How about calling her my wife?

01:47.492 --> 01:50.292
Wives don't take boys
from their mothers.

01:50.294 --> 01:53.546
They do.
That's why we marry them!

01:54.498 --> 01:57.282
I just hope I'm not dead
from a broken heart

01:57.284 --> 01:59.168
before you get back.

01:59.170 --> 02:03.556
Ma, please. Everyone from NASA
is listening to this phone call.

02:03.558 --> 02:07.309
Good. They should know
what a horrible son you are!

02:07.311 --> 02:10.513
Okay, Ma, great talking to you!
Gotta go!

02:10.514 --> 02:12.648
(sighs)

02:12.650 --> 02:15.801

02:48.386 --> 02:51.221
This is so exciting.

02:51.223 --> 02:53.974
Soon, my upper lip will
be the same fake blonde

02:53.976 --> 02:56.059
as my beautiful
best friend.

02:56.894 --> 02:59.279
Hey, this is
my natural hair color.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.617
Now.

03:03.619 --> 03:05.786
So, does Sheldon have
anything special

03:05.788 --> 03:07.571
planned for you
tomorrow night?

03:07.573 --> 03:10.240
Oh, yes. According to the
Relationship Agreement,

03:10.242 --> 03:12.092
on the anniversary
of our first date,

03:12.094 --> 03:15.262
he must take me to a nice
dinner, ask about my day

03:15.264 --> 03:17.214
and engage in casual
physical contact

03:17.216 --> 03:20.684
that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

03:20.686 --> 03:22.636
That's hot.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.273
You kids better use protection.

03:26.275 --> 03:28.892
How long does
this stay on?

03:28.894 --> 03:30.027
Just a couple of minutes.

03:30.029 --> 03:31.311
You've really never
done this before?

03:31.313 --> 03:33.864
Once in high school,
but I dozed off

03:33.866 --> 03:37.084
and woke up with second-degree
chemical burns on my face.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.902
Oh, my gosh,
that's awful.

03:38.904 --> 03:40.487
The other kids
make fun of you?

03:40.489 --> 03:43.791
No, I had a cover story;
I told everyone it was herpes.

03:45.210 --> 03:47.494
So, how's everything going
with you and Leonard?

03:47.496 --> 03:49.613
(sighs): I don't know,
it's still kind of weird.

03:49.615 --> 03:51.899
We haven't really recovered
since he proposed to me

03:51.901 --> 03:53.267
in the middle of sex.

03:53.269 --> 03:55.886
Oh. Boo-hoo.

03:55.888 --> 03:57.788
If Sheldon proposed
to me during sex,

03:57.790 --> 04:01.558
my ovaries would grab on to him
and never let go.

04:05.980 --> 04:10.484
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

04:10.486 --> 04:13.187
Interesting question. On the
one hand, I always thought...

04:13.189 --> 04:16.473
You don't even know
what it is, do you?

04:16.475 --> 04:19.692
The anthropic principle states
that if we wish to explain

04:19.695 --> 04:22.196
why our universe exists
the way it does,

04:22.198 --> 04:25.148
the answer is that
it must have qualities

04:25.150 --> 04:27.534
that allow intelligent
creatures to arise

04:27.536 --> 04:29.703
who are capable of
asking the question.

04:29.705 --> 04:33.173
As I am doing
so eloquently right now.

04:33.175 --> 04:36.210
I know what
the anthropic principle is.

04:36.212 --> 04:38.595
Of course.
I just explained it to you.

04:38.597 --> 04:42.165
Now, where do you
stand on it?

04:42.167 --> 04:44.301
Where do you stand on it?
Strongly pro.

04:44.303 --> 04:47.070
Then I believe that God
created the world in six days,

04:47.072 --> 04:49.773
and on the seventh,
he made you to annoy me.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.145
Hey, guys.
Hey.

04:55.147 --> 04:57.064
Yeah, wait, Raj,
where do you stand

04:57.066 --> 04:58.699
on the anthropic
principle?

04:58.701 --> 05:00.851
I'm all for it.
Attaboy!

05:00.853 --> 05:02.185
Well, hang on.
Why do you believe

05:02.187 --> 05:03.904
that he knows
what it is and I don't?

05:03.906 --> 05:06.623
Oh, Leonard.
Let's not take a saw

05:06.625 --> 05:09.192
to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

05:09.194 --> 05:10.744
Hey, uh,
if you guys

05:10.746 --> 05:13.831
are free tonight, I heard about
a spa where you soak your feet

05:13.833 --> 05:15.382
in a pool full of little fish

05:15.384 --> 05:17.417
that eat all the dead skin
right off them.

05:17.419 --> 05:19.202
I don't need
to tell you,

05:19.204 --> 05:23.223
in Los Angeles, sandal
season is year round.

05:23.225 --> 05:25.676
Actually, I'm hanging
out with Penny.

05:25.678 --> 05:29.062
Oh, okay. Sounds like
it's me and you, Sheldon.

05:29.064 --> 05:31.882
How about we sic some guppies
on those puppies?

05:32.934 --> 05:35.485
As I've stated before
on numerous occasions,

05:35.487 --> 05:38.488
the only sea creature I would
even consider being eaten by

05:38.490 --> 05:41.692
is the Kraken, because
the last words I would hear are:

05:41.694 --> 05:44.027
"Release the Kraken."

05:44.029 --> 05:45.829
That never gets old.

05:45.831 --> 05:49.232
"Release the Kraken!"
Oh, chills.

05:49.234 --> 05:52.085
Besides, I'm having
dinner with Amy.

05:52.087 --> 05:54.922
Oh, okay. I'll just go home
and be alone.

05:54.924 --> 05:56.072
W-Which is cool.

05:56.074 --> 05:59.793
I eat alone, I sleep alone,
I cry alone, so...

05:59.795 --> 06:01.728
Cool.

06:03.464 --> 06:07.517
Darn. If you weren't busy,
I'd ask you to join us.

06:08.269 --> 06:10.604
Really? I can
come? Thanks!

06:10.606 --> 06:13.106
Sheldon, are you sure
you want to be bringing Raj

06:13.108 --> 06:14.725
on your date night
with Amy?

06:14.727 --> 06:16.476
Oh, absolutely.

06:16.478 --> 06:21.097
I have a contractual obligation
to provide Amy with conversation

06:21.099 --> 06:22.983
and casual
physical contact,

06:22.985 --> 06:24.651
but nowhere is it specified

06:24.653 --> 06:27.788
that I can't outsource that
to an Indian.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.795
BERNADETTE:
Howie?

06:34.797 --> 06:35.829
Howie?

06:35.831 --> 06:38.916
Hey, there's my beautiful bride!

06:38.918 --> 06:40.217
Can you see me?

06:40.219 --> 06:42.552
I can.
How are you?

06:42.554 --> 06:43.720
(chuckles):
I'm amazing.

06:43.722 --> 06:46.173
I mean, this is
even better than I dreamed.

06:46.175 --> 06:50.894
I look out the window, and...
it's all so unbelievable.

06:50.896 --> 06:52.262
Good for you.

06:52.264 --> 06:56.733
I just had a seemingly endless
dinner with your mom.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.903
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

06:59.905 --> 07:02.606
It was. Until I found out
you never told her

07:02.608 --> 07:04.091
we're not gonna live with her.

07:04.093 --> 07:07.527
Let's talk about <i>that</i>
for a minute.

07:08.413 --> 07:11.648
Hey, look, this pen is floating.

07:11.650 --> 07:14.701
How crazy is that?

07:17.872 --> 07:20.340
You said you told her,
but you never did!

07:20.342 --> 07:23.827
Okay, okay, I know
you're upset, but...

07:23.829 --> 07:28.265
let me share something
I've learned since I got here.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.100
You realize

07:30.102 --> 07:32.502
how small your problems are

07:32.504 --> 07:35.355
when you're looking down
on them from space.

07:35.357 --> 07:36.606
(chuckles)

07:36.608 --> 07:38.825
Now, come on, that's got
to make you feel better.

07:38.827 --> 07:41.995
How clear is the image
of me on that screen?

07:41.997 --> 07:43.530
Pretty clear.

07:43.532 --> 07:46.333
Do I <i>look</i> like I feel better?

07:46.335 --> 07:51.121
I mean, it's not, like,
HD quality.

07:51.123 --> 07:52.873
Listen, mister, you're
gonna talk to your mother

07:52.875 --> 07:55.108
and you're gonna fix this,
or that thing I said

07:55.110 --> 07:57.511
I was gonna do to you
the minute you got home,

07:57.513 --> 08:00.464
you can do to yourself.

08:02.533 --> 08:05.419
(Russian accent): Like he's been
doing since he got here.

08:10.541 --> 08:14.061
Sheldon, this place
is so romantic.

08:14.063 --> 08:15.679
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

08:15.681 --> 08:17.064
Raj picked it out.

08:17.066 --> 08:21.101
Well, when you see him,
tell him I say thank you.

08:21.103 --> 08:22.819
Tell him yourself.

08:22.821 --> 08:24.654
Yoo-hoo!

08:24.656 --> 08:26.323
Over here!

08:28.076 --> 08:30.711
I don't understand.
What's he doing here?

08:30.713 --> 08:31.778
I invited him.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.947
On our date?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.782
Sheldon, that's not okay.

08:35.784 --> 08:37.333
Yes, it is.

08:37.336 --> 08:40.470
There's a loophole
in the Relationship Agreement.

08:40.472 --> 08:42.239
You found a loophole?

08:44.425 --> 08:47.327
Sorry I started without you.
I'm a little nervous.

08:47.329 --> 08:50.097
It's been a long time
since I've been on a date.

08:50.099 --> 08:54.551
I can't believe I bleached
my mustache for this.

08:54.553 --> 08:55.802
You should go
to my girl.

08:55.804 --> 08:57.938
She'll knock out
those sideburns for free.

09:04.607 --> 09:06.673
You know, Amy,
I don't even think

09:06.675 --> 09:08.942
you and I have had
a real conversation.

09:08.944 --> 09:12.062
Let's use tonight to get to know
each other a little better.

09:12.064 --> 09:13.764
You start.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.552
Go home.

09:18.554 --> 09:20.737
I don't understand.

09:20.739 --> 09:23.607
Sheldon, how could you do this?
It's our second anniversary.

09:23.609 --> 09:25.342
It's your anniversary?!

09:25.344 --> 09:28.345
Oh, my God, I had no idea.

09:28.347 --> 09:30.864
Amy, please,
let me make this right.

09:30.866 --> 09:32.015
Thank you.

09:32.017 --> 09:33.350
My pleasure.
Waiter?

09:33.352 --> 09:35.953
A bottle of champagne
and three glasses.

09:36.821 --> 09:38.021
Oh, boy,

09:38.023 --> 09:40.490
isn't this romantic?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.693
Oh, I hope that's
a rhetorical question,

09:42.695 --> 09:44.861
because I have no clue.

09:46.881 --> 09:49.166
This is great.
What's the occasion?

09:49.168 --> 09:51.001
No occasion. You know,
things have been

09:51.003 --> 09:53.837
a little weird between us,
so I wanted to throw together

09:53.839 --> 09:55.172
a fun night
just for you.

09:55.174 --> 09:57.424
That is so sweet.
I got all your favorites.

09:57.426 --> 09:58.592
Beer, wings, sliders.

09:58.594 --> 10:00.227
We can watch the
football game.

10:00.229 --> 10:02.429
I even painted my stomach.

10:04.065 --> 10:06.216
"Go sports"?
Well...

10:06.218 --> 10:08.235
in case you were in
the mood for baseball,

10:08.237 --> 10:11.154
I didn't want to
look ridiculous.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.555
This is awesome.
I love it!

10:12.557 --> 10:13.556
Good, I'm glad.

10:13.558 --> 10:15.142
Gosh, I worked
my ass off today.

10:15.144 --> 10:16.576
This is exactly
what I needed.

10:16.578 --> 10:18.328
Great. Just relax and enjoy.

10:18.330 --> 10:19.813
Tonight is all about you.

10:19.815 --> 10:21.448
Ah, thank you!

10:21.450 --> 10:24.051
(chuckles, sighs)

10:24.053 --> 10:27.838
So, where exactly are we
in this relationship?

10:28.673 --> 10:29.873
Oh, come on!

10:29.875 --> 10:32.042
I just told you
I had a hard day.

10:32.044 --> 10:33.794
You're right, I'm sorry.
Let's watch the game.

10:33.796 --> 10:35.145
Great.

10:35.147 --> 10:36.480
(sighs)

10:36.482 --> 10:39.349
I just know the longer
we wait to talk about it,

10:39.351 --> 10:41.418
the weirder it gets.

10:41.420 --> 10:45.105
Sweetie, can I just be
the girl tonight?

10:45.107 --> 10:47.107
Absolutely.
You're the girl, I'm the guy.

10:47.109 --> 10:48.625
Now, you watch
your football game

10:48.627 --> 10:50.627
while I make you a
little plate here.

10:50.629 --> 10:52.462
Thank you!

10:53.464 --> 10:54.698
(knocking)

10:54.700 --> 10:55.866
Oh, I'll get it.

10:55.868 --> 10:58.118
Go sports!
(chuckles)

10:59.654 --> 11:02.072
Hello-lo-lo.

11:02.074 --> 11:03.206
What are you doing here?

11:03.208 --> 11:04.992
I thought you were out
th Sheldon and Amy.

11:04.994 --> 11:06.126
I was, but it's
their anniversary

11:06.128 --> 11:08.011
and I didn't want
to be a third wheel,

11:08.013 --> 11:09.296
so I figured I'd come over here

11:09.298 --> 11:11.614
and hang out with you
and Penny on your date.

11:11.616 --> 11:14.001
Well, it's not really
a great time.

11:14.003 --> 11:15.886
Penny and I have some things
we need to talk about.

11:15.888 --> 11:17.671
No, we don't!
Come on in!

11:17.673 --> 11:19.456
Sweet!

11:19.458 --> 11:23.844
(quietly): I can't believe
I shaved my stomach for this.

11:29.283 --> 11:31.568
Hey, Froot Loops.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.690
You got a phone call.

11:36.692 --> 11:37.841
Who is it?

11:37.843 --> 11:39.826
A woman who says
she's your mother

11:39.828 --> 11:42.245
but sounds like
your father.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.984
Hey, Ma.

11:47.986 --> 11:50.087
You know, we could
see each other

11:50.089 --> 11:52.005
if you turn on the computer.

11:52.007 --> 11:54.341
I'm not going near
that fakakta thing.

11:54.343 --> 11:57.260
I'll catch a computer virus!

11:58.096 --> 12:01.348
You can't catch
a computer virus.

12:01.350 --> 12:06.186
Oh, so now you're an astronaut
<i>and</i> a doctor?

12:06.188 --> 12:09.473
(voice cracks):
What do you want, Ma?

12:09.475 --> 12:13.276
Your wife says you have
something important to tell me.

12:14.062 --> 12:17.114
Okay, here it is.

12:17.116 --> 12:21.568
Bernadette and I are starting
a life together and...

12:21.570 --> 12:24.521
Oh, God!
You <i>are</i> gonna leave me!

12:24.523 --> 12:25.688
Ma...

12:25.690 --> 12:27.023
It's okay.

12:27.025 --> 12:29.493
Your father left me,
you left me--

12:29.495 --> 12:33.046
I guess I'm just the kind
of person people like to leave.

12:34.665 --> 12:37.467
It's not... definite.

12:37.469 --> 12:39.636
I'll talk to Bernadette.

12:39.638 --> 12:40.804
Don't bother.

12:40.806 --> 12:43.090
I'll just go sit in a hole
in the ground

12:43.092 --> 12:45.875
so I'm no trouble when I die.

12:46.761 --> 12:48.478
Stop it, Ma.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.215
I'm sure I can get
Bernie to come around.

12:52.217 --> 12:53.884
I knew it!

12:53.886 --> 12:55.519
I knew she was behind this!

12:55.521 --> 12:58.155
You listen to me,
if you want to be a man,

12:58.157 --> 13:01.942
you can't let a woman
tell you what to do!

13:01.944 --> 13:03.110
Okay,

13:03.112 --> 13:04.995
okay.
(sighs)

13:04.997 --> 13:08.398
I can't believe these people
won the Cold War.

13:10.401 --> 13:13.703
Now, can we please
change the subject?

13:13.705 --> 13:14.838
Fine.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.973
<i>Explain why</i>
<i>you've been gone so long</i>

13:16.975 --> 13:19.042
<i>and I haven't gotten</i>
<i>a single letter.</i>

13:19.044 --> 13:22.512
<i>Not even a lousy postcard!</i>

13:23.664 --> 13:26.416
(TV sports announcer talking)

13:26.418 --> 13:30.253
You know, I'm growing to like
American football.

13:30.255 --> 13:32.289
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
Well...

13:32.291 --> 13:35.142
it's not the balls-to-the-wall
action of badminton or cricket,

13:35.144 --> 13:37.260
but hey...

13:37.262 --> 13:39.496
what is?

13:40.631 --> 13:42.098
All right, who's ready
for another beer?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.667
I'm good.
No, thank you.

13:43.669 --> 13:45.202
Girls.

13:46.037 --> 13:48.805
(sighs): I am having
the nicest time.

13:48.807 --> 13:50.941
You guys are like
family to me.

13:50.943 --> 13:52.142
You know that, right?

13:52.144 --> 13:54.127
That's great.
Get out.

13:54.129 --> 13:55.662
What? Why?

13:55.664 --> 13:57.914
Penny and I have some issues
we need to talk about.

13:57.916 --> 13:58.882
Oh...

13:58.884 --> 14:01.134
pish on your issues!

14:02.003 --> 14:04.070
You guys are fine.

14:04.072 --> 14:06.122
Yes, you hit some bumps
along the way.

14:06.124 --> 14:07.390
I mean, Penny,

14:07.392 --> 14:10.327
you've always known how this man
has felt about you,

14:10.329 --> 14:12.846
but you made him
grovel for affection.

14:12.848 --> 14:13.980
Okay, hold on...

14:13.982 --> 14:15.182
Now, don't blame yourself.

14:15.184 --> 14:17.484
He was a groveler from way back.

14:18.903 --> 14:22.873
But the point is,
the two of you got past it.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.674
And, Leonard,
you go and propose

14:24.676 --> 14:26.860
to this poor girl
in the middle of sex?

14:26.862 --> 14:29.696
That was some weak tea, dude.

14:30.531 --> 14:32.415
Some people might
say it was romantic.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.150
Yeah, no.

14:34.152 --> 14:38.488
But yet, here you two are,
still together.

14:38.490 --> 14:41.658
And that's even after you and I
had our crazy naked night.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.909
Okay...
That's enough.

14:42.911 --> 14:44.444
I'm just saying

14:44.446 --> 14:46.162
that after everything
you've been through,

14:46.164 --> 14:48.298
you get to look
into each other's eyes

14:48.300 --> 14:50.967
and say "I love you."

14:50.969 --> 14:52.986
And that's beautiful.

14:55.806 --> 14:59.025
Actually, to this day,
she's never really said it.

14:59.961 --> 15:02.495
Oh, Penny!
That's ridiculous!

15:03.531 --> 15:04.497
You know you love him!

15:04.499 --> 15:06.032
You look him in the eyes
and you say it.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.033
Raj...
Oh, come on,

15:07.035 --> 15:09.119
you know you want to say it.
Say it.

15:09.787 --> 15:12.055
Say you love him.

15:13.908 --> 15:16.359
Say it!

15:20.047 --> 15:22.599
I really thought
she would say it.

15:29.724 --> 15:34.527
Have I ever told you you're
like a sexy praying mantis?

15:35.379 --> 15:38.648
Every time you drink alcohol.

15:38.650 --> 15:41.718
You know what's wonderful
about the praying mantis?

15:42.520 --> 15:45.405
They devour their mate.

15:45.407 --> 15:47.207
Your point being?

15:54.332 --> 15:56.800
Dessert is served.

15:57.635 --> 16:00.337
I just had cobbler.

16:01.205 --> 16:02.839
You know what?

16:02.841 --> 16:04.624
I'm done with this.

16:06.177 --> 16:07.577
W-Where are
you going?

16:07.579 --> 16:09.179
I'm leaving.

16:09.181 --> 16:10.764
You can't leave.

16:10.766 --> 16:12.198
I need you.

16:14.051 --> 16:16.236
You do?

16:16.238 --> 16:17.954
Yes.

16:17.956 --> 16:20.190
You're my ride.

16:21.559 --> 16:24.894
Sheldon, you either say
something meaningful

16:24.896 --> 16:28.415
and from the heart,
or you and I are done.

16:30.034 --> 16:31.484
All right.

16:32.603 --> 16:35.455
Please.

16:38.326 --> 16:40.910
Amy...

16:40.912 --> 16:43.413
when I look in your eyes

16:43.415 --> 16:45.615
and you're looking
back in mine,

16:45.617 --> 16:49.502
everything feels
not quite normal,

16:49.504 --> 16:52.038
because I feel

16:52.040 --> 16:55.892
stronger and weaker
at the same time.

16:55.894 --> 17:01.798
I feel excited and,
at the same time, terrified.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.133
The truth is,

17:04.135 --> 17:07.069
I don't know
what I feel, except...

17:07.071 --> 17:11.241
I know what kind of man
I want to be.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.577
Sheldon...

17:14.579 --> 17:16.413
that was beautiful.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.579
I should hope so.

17:17.582 --> 17:19.965
That's from the first
Spider-Man movie.

17:24.704 --> 17:27.557
I'll take it.

17:28.376 --> 17:29.793
Good.

17:29.795 --> 17:32.178
Now, I assume
we're splitting the check?

17:36.517 --> 17:37.667
Hey, Stuart.

17:37.669 --> 17:40.804
Oh, hey. I was actually
just about to close up.

17:40.806 --> 17:42.138
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.723
No, no. It's
okay. Hang out.

17:43.725 --> 17:44.808
You sure?

17:44.810 --> 17:47.277
Yeah, you're
my first customer today.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.429
All right. Great.

17:49.431 --> 17:50.847
I'm, uh, having a nightcap.

17:50.849 --> 17:52.348
You want to join me?

17:52.350 --> 17:53.516
What are you drinking?

17:53.518 --> 17:56.519
Coffee liqueur
in a Chewbacca mug.

17:56.521 --> 17:59.372
I call it a sad-tini.

17:59.374 --> 18:01.958
Perfect for the night
I'm having. Thank you.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.211
Hmm. Nice not
to drink alone.

18:05.213 --> 18:06.863
Amen to that.

18:06.865 --> 18:08.548
Sometimes I pour

18:08.550 --> 18:11.384
a little chardonnay
into my dog's water bowl.

18:11.386 --> 18:13.553
You're kidding.

18:13.555 --> 18:16.639
She's kind of a mean drunk,
but what are you gonna do?

18:16.641 --> 18:17.924
Cheers.

18:17.926 --> 18:19.375
Cheers.

18:19.377 --> 18:21.144
A little music?
Sure.

18:21.146 --> 18:24.814
(soft Brazilian jazz playing)

18:24.816 --> 18:27.400
Mmm. Bossa nova.

18:27.402 --> 18:30.987
You listen to that with
your hips as well as your ears.

18:30.989 --> 18:32.388
Mmm.

18:33.774 --> 18:35.909
Oh.

18:35.911 --> 18:37.994
Something about...

18:37.996 --> 18:40.413
Latin music just
makes me feel like

18:40.415 --> 18:43.500
I'm on a white sand beach
in Rio.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.369
Yeah.

18:46.371 --> 18:50.457
The sun, the waves,
the beautiful bodies,

18:50.459 --> 18:54.093
tanned and glistening
with sweat.

18:54.095 --> 18:56.579
(Brazilian jazz continues)

18:58.000 --> 19:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:09.226 --> 19:10.927
I should go.
Yeah.

19:11.762 --> 19:14.063
Uh, thank you
for the drink.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.566
No problem.

19:16.568 --> 19:17.450
(sighs)

19:17.452 --> 19:19.402
Hey, Stuart.
Yeah?

19:19.404 --> 19:22.622
Do you want to...
hang out tomorrow night,

19:22.624 --> 19:25.291
maybe grab a bite to eat
or catch a late movie?

19:25.293 --> 19:29.111
Yeah, I-I'd like to,
but I'm a little tight on funds.

19:29.113 --> 19:30.630
No problem. My treat.

19:30.632 --> 19:32.215
I'll swing by after work.

19:32.217 --> 19:33.500
Okay.

19:33.502 --> 19:35.134
Okay.

19:38.956 --> 19:41.841
I could do worse.

19:46.629 --> 19:48.165
BERNADETTE: <i>Aw, that's such</i>
<i>good news, Howie.</i>

19:48.166 --> 19:49.565
<i>Thank you for telling her.</i>

19:49.567 --> 19:52.685
Hey, I'm a grown man;
I'm gonna live with my wife.

19:52.687 --> 19:57.106
My mother's just gonna have
to learn to make do on her own.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.891
Was she upset?

19:58.893 --> 20:02.261
Who can tell?
She yells everything.

20:03.814 --> 20:06.065
She might have been upset.

20:06.067 --> 20:08.701
She might have been hungry.

20:08.703 --> 20:11.154
Thanks for fixing it.

20:11.156 --> 20:12.655
I love you.

20:12.657 --> 20:13.906
I love you, too.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.908
Sweet dreams.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

20:15.910 --> 20:18.778
Good night, Rocket Man.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.447
To infinity and beyond, baby.

20:21.449 --> 20:22.882
(clicks tongue)

20:24.017 --> 20:25.451
Loops.

20:25.453 --> 20:27.954
You realize you just
lied your ass off

20:27.956 --> 20:30.056
to your wife
<i>and</i> your mother.

20:30.058 --> 20:31.424
I know.

20:31.426 --> 20:33.543
What are you gonna do
when you get back to Earth?

20:33.545 --> 20:34.894
Oh, I'm never going back.
