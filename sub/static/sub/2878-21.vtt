WEBVTT

00:03.147 --> 00:05.893
So, I got the craziest
e-mail this morning.

00:05.894 --> 00:07.593
I don't mean to burst
your bubble, dude,

00:07.595 --> 00:10.947
but those penile enlargement
pills do not work.

00:10.949 --> 00:14.400
Believe me, I know.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.385
The e-mail I got was

00:16.387 --> 00:18.321
from the office of
Stephen Hawking.

00:18.323 --> 00:19.889
- You're kidding.
- Why?

00:19.891 --> 00:22.241
He's coming to the university
for a couple weeks to lecture,

00:22.243 --> 00:24.527
and he's looking for an
engineer to help maintain

00:24.529 --> 00:26.462
the equipment on his wheelchair.

00:26.464 --> 00:27.497
That's amazing.

00:27.499 --> 00:30.082
You'll be like his pit crew.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.953
A word of caution:
I would not do

00:33.955 --> 00:36.122
your Stephen Hawking
impression in front of him.

00:37.591 --> 00:39.592
(in Stephen Hawking's voice):
You're right.

00:40.744 --> 00:45.414
I suppose that could be
considered offensive.

00:45.416 --> 00:48.467
Boy, Sheldon's going
to freak out.

00:48.469 --> 00:50.419
Yeah, he worships Hawking.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.054
I was actually thinking
about bringing him along

00:52.056 --> 00:54.624
when I go over there so
he can meet the great man.

00:54.626 --> 00:55.808
That's really nice
of you, Howard.

00:55.810 --> 00:57.393
It's no big deal.

00:57.395 --> 00:59.979
Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

00:59.981 --> 01:03.599
It'll look so nice next to
the ones he's already got

01:03.601 --> 01:06.619
from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

01:07.621 --> 01:09.488
Leonard, do you recall

01:09.490 --> 01:11.073
when I said that I was going

01:11.075 --> 01:13.042
to revolutionize
humanity's understanding

01:13.044 --> 01:15.328
of the Higgs boson particle,
and you said,

01:15.330 --> 01:17.997
"Sheldon, it's 2:00 a.m.,
get out of my bedroom"?

01:17.999 --> 01:19.949
Like it was ten hours ago.

01:19.951 --> 01:21.634
What about it?

01:21.636 --> 01:23.002
Well, I believe I've done it.

01:23.004 --> 01:24.787
And I'm only saying "believe"
to sound modest,

01:24.789 --> 01:27.306
because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

01:27.308 --> 01:29.508
Really?
That's incredible. Oh, here.

01:29.510 --> 01:30.476
Break out the math.

01:30.478 --> 01:32.061
Oh, okay, let me see this.

01:32.063 --> 01:34.597
All right, so
this particle here

01:34.599 --> 01:37.350
is the boson moving
forward in time.

01:37.352 --> 01:39.518
Now, I was thinking...
Howard, you go ahead and eat.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.354
This isn't going to make
any sense to you.

01:43.507 --> 01:46.909
Sheldon, I have a working
understanding of physics.

01:46.911 --> 01:50.145
Yeah, good for you,
and don't stop working on it.

01:50.147 --> 01:52.582
Are you still
going to tell him

01:52.584 --> 01:54.667
about you-know-who?
Yep.

01:54.669 --> 01:55.952
Are you still going
to introduce him?

01:55.954 --> 01:57.587
Not on your life.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.435
Please, please, please

02:30.437 --> 02:32.304
let me meet Hawking.

02:32.306 --> 02:33.472
I told you, no.

02:33.474 --> 02:35.307
But I said I'm sorry.

02:35.309 --> 02:38.227
No, you said, "Would it help
if I said I'm sorry?"

02:38.229 --> 02:41.196
And you never answered me.

02:41.198 --> 02:43.515
So who owes whom an apology now?

02:43.517 --> 02:46.151
Sheldon,
you're a condescending jerk.

02:46.153 --> 02:48.704
Why on earth would I want
to do something nice for you?

02:48.706 --> 02:49.905
Um...

02:49.907 --> 02:51.990
to go to Jewish heaven?

02:51.992 --> 02:55.377
Jews don't have heaven.

02:55.379 --> 02:57.429
Then to avoid Jewish hell?

02:57.431 --> 02:58.547
Have you met my mother?

02:58.549 --> 02:59.798
I live in Jewish hell.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.217
Howard, please.

03:02.219 --> 03:03.852
This is Stephen Hawking.

03:03.854 --> 03:06.171
Perhaps my only
intellectual equal.

03:06.173 --> 03:08.957
(chuckling)
Oh, you can't be serious.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.510
Try to put yourself
in my place.

03:11.512 --> 03:14.045
Imagine you're the
sole human being

03:14.047 --> 03:16.982
living on a planet populated
with nothing but dogs.

03:16.984 --> 03:18.901
And then it turns out

03:18.903 --> 03:21.820
there's another human being.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.990
Hang on.

03:24.992 --> 03:28.193
Are you saying
the rest of us are dogs?

03:28.195 --> 03:30.779
Okay, I can see you're going
to take this the wrong way.

03:30.781 --> 03:32.030
Let me try again.

03:32.032 --> 03:33.282
Imagine you're the
sole human being

03:33.284 --> 03:38.070
living on a planet populated
with nothing but chimps.

03:38.072 --> 03:39.905
Get out of my lab.

03:39.907 --> 03:41.506
Oh, now they're so much smarter
than dogs.

03:41.508 --> 03:43.275
Have you seen them
on those little bicycles?

03:43.277 --> 03:45.460
Get out.

03:46.579 --> 03:48.180
How about dolphins?

03:48.182 --> 03:48.931
Out!

03:51.768 --> 03:54.303
So, come on, how was
the first day with Hawking?

03:54.305 --> 03:55.470
It was great.

03:55.472 --> 03:56.939
We talked about movies...

03:56.941 --> 03:58.857
(groans): Oh...

03:58.859 --> 04:00.309
I showed him some card tricks...

04:00.311 --> 04:02.060
Oh!

04:02.062 --> 04:04.529
He even let me read a couple
pages from his new book.

04:04.531 --> 04:07.266
(groans): Oh!

04:07.268 --> 04:10.935
Something got
you down there, bunky?

04:10.937 --> 04:14.122
Howard, please,
I'm begging you.

04:14.124 --> 04:15.824
Raj,
you're our group historian.

04:15.826 --> 04:17.492
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

04:17.494 --> 04:18.877
Three times.

04:18.879 --> 04:22.331
He begged the Fox network
not to cancel <i>Firefly.</i>

04:22.333 --> 04:23.632
He begged

04:23.634 --> 04:27.035
the TNT network
to cancel <i>Babylon 5.</i>

04:28.454 --> 04:31.223
And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl Parade,

04:31.225 --> 04:33.091
he begged a deity
he doesn't believe in

04:33.093 --> 04:34.793
to end his life quickly.

04:36.312 --> 04:39.431
Do you understand how
important Hawking is to me?

04:39.433 --> 04:41.266
When I was six years old,

04:41.268 --> 04:44.486
I dressed up as
him for Halloween.

04:45.705 --> 04:47.105
You're kidding.

04:47.107 --> 04:49.808
No, sir, no, I took
my dad's desk chair,

04:49.810 --> 04:51.360
attached a Speak
& Spell to it

04:51.362 --> 04:53.779
and made my sister push
me up and down the block

04:53.781 --> 04:55.297
to trick or treat.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.583
Granted most people
thought I was R2-D2,

04:58.585 --> 05:01.370
but still, I got a lot of candy.

05:01.372 --> 05:03.255
You don't seem
to be understanding

05:03.257 --> 05:04.790
the English word "no."

05:04.792 --> 05:07.009
Maybe a different language
will help.

05:07.011 --> 05:08.210
Russian: <i>nyet.</i>

05:08.212 --> 05:10.462
Chinese: <i>bu.</i>

05:10.464 --> 05:11.847
Japanese: <i>iie.</i>

05:11.849 --> 05:14.332
Klingon: <i>qo'.</i>

05:14.334 --> 05:19.304
Binary coded Ascii:
0110111001101111.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.075
It's actually 01100111.

05:23.077 --> 05:23.942
No!

05:23.944 --> 05:27.195
I'm not asking for me,

05:27.197 --> 05:30.799
I'm asking for Hawking.

05:30.801 --> 05:35.320
Let me try gansta:
Hells naw.

05:38.691 --> 05:40.358
Okay, look, how about this?

05:40.360 --> 05:43.027
Just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

05:43.029 --> 05:44.329
If he sees the
incredible breakthrough

05:44.331 --> 05:46.248
I've made, he'll
reach out to me.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.215
What if he doesn't?

05:47.217 --> 05:49.184
He will; he's really smart.

05:51.571 --> 05:52.971
That's an interesting idea.

05:52.973 --> 05:54.222
Why don't you give me

05:54.224 --> 05:56.641
a minute to talk it over
with my friends?

05:56.643 --> 05:58.009
- How do I do that?
- You walk away.

05:58.011 --> 06:00.211
Walking away.

06:08.488 --> 06:11.606
You do realize
you own his ass right now.

06:11.608 --> 06:13.725
I do.

06:13.727 --> 06:15.744
You can make him
do anything you want.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.696
Yeah, I know, I'm just trying
to figure out

06:17.698 --> 06:19.664
how much I want to punish him.

06:19.666 --> 06:20.949
Well, don't be too mean.

06:20.951 --> 06:22.167
SHELDON:
Hey, fellas,

06:22.169 --> 06:23.401
I'm thinking about making some

06:23.403 --> 06:25.704
freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

06:25.706 --> 06:26.872
I wouldn't mind a glass.

06:26.874 --> 06:28.223
I wasn't talking to you.

06:30.093 --> 06:33.195
Bring him to his bony knees.

06:36.716 --> 06:38.266
Sheldon, come on back.

06:38.268 --> 06:41.470
Yes, yes.

06:44.474 --> 06:46.057
What did you decide?

06:46.059 --> 06:48.927
I'll give your paper
to Professor Hawking.

06:48.929 --> 06:50.395
Great, thank you!

06:50.397 --> 06:52.230
Oh, that's terrific!

06:52.232 --> 06:56.485
But in exchange, I'd like you
to do a few things for me.

06:56.487 --> 06:58.320
What kinds of things?

06:58.322 --> 07:03.241
Are you familiar
with the 12 labors of Hercules?

07:04.660 --> 07:06.378
Of course.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.947
You should be so lucky.

07:11.501 --> 07:13.335
All right.

07:13.337 --> 07:14.970
What would you like me
to do first?

07:14.972 --> 07:16.955
Well, I thought
I'd start you off

07:16.957 --> 07:19.007
by polishing my belt buckles.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.124
Oh.

07:20.126 --> 07:21.560
By all means.

07:21.562 --> 07:24.629
When I was a boy, I would
polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

07:24.631 --> 07:26.798
And she would entertain me
with stories

07:26.800 --> 07:28.350
about growing up in Oklahoma.

07:28.352 --> 07:29.601
Interesting woman.

07:29.603 --> 07:34.072
She once killed a prairie dog
with a gravy boat.

07:34.074 --> 07:36.992
That's nice.

07:42.982 --> 07:45.217
(exhales)

07:46.569 --> 07:49.070
That's a lot of belt buckles.

07:49.072 --> 07:52.841
Funny thing is,
I only have one belt.

07:53.876 --> 07:55.927
Anyway, I'll let
you get started.

07:55.929 --> 07:57.295
Oh, by the way,

07:57.297 --> 07:59.998
the little marks, uh,
that look like water spots--

08:00.000 --> 08:03.285
I tend to stand too close
to the urinal, so...

08:04.854 --> 08:08.190
...what you're seeing there
is splash back.

08:10.510 --> 08:12.844
You make sissy
on your belt buckles?

08:15.765 --> 08:18.683
Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

08:18.685 --> 08:21.786
Here is a black light
to check them.

08:21.788 --> 08:23.321
And for your own peace of mind,

08:23.323 --> 08:26.208
you might not want to shine that
around the rest of the room.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:35.701 --> 08:38.053
Sheldon, these look great.

08:38.054 --> 08:40.554
They're like
magnificent little crowns

08:40.557 --> 08:44.009
to hang over
my magnificent little jewels.

08:46.095 --> 08:47.395
How'd you get them so shiny?

08:47.397 --> 08:49.931
Oh, I-I buffed them
with Turtle Wax.

08:49.933 --> 08:52.383
The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on,

08:52.385 --> 08:55.403
the urine should just bead up
and roll right off.

08:55.405 --> 08:57.388
Way to go the extra mile.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.074
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

08:59.076 --> 09:01.526
My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

09:01.528 --> 09:04.746
Now will you give
Professor Hawking my paper?

09:04.748 --> 09:06.064
Oh, my dear boy, no.

09:06.066 --> 09:07.165
Okay.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.000
Next,

09:09.002 --> 09:12.754
this is
a sexy French maid costume

09:12.756 --> 09:14.089
I bought for Bernadette.

09:14.091 --> 09:15.707
I thought it might
spice things up

09:15.709 --> 09:18.009
and get her to dust
my room at the same time,

09:18.011 --> 09:21.913
but I was wrong
and really wrong.

09:21.915 --> 09:24.049
And you want me to
return it for you?

09:24.051 --> 09:27.519
<i>No, no, no, mon petit cherie.</i>

09:41.651 --> 09:43.535
What are you all staring at?

09:43.537 --> 09:45.904
You ever seen a man try
to get a meeting

09:45.906 --> 09:47.772
with Stephen Hawking before?

09:49.292 --> 09:51.159
(laughter)

10:01.926 --> 10:03.063
Hey.

10:03.064 --> 10:04.680
Hello.

10:04.682 --> 10:05.615
It's not Saturday night.

10:05.617 --> 10:07.516
Why are you doing
your laundry?

10:07.518 --> 10:11.070
This is not
my laundry.

10:11.072 --> 10:12.054
Wow, are these Amy's?

10:12.056 --> 10:15.625
Kind of trashy-- good for her.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.493
Those are Howard's.

10:17.495 --> 10:19.579
Ugh...

10:20.547 --> 10:22.165
Why are you washing

10:22.167 --> 10:25.501
Howard's man panties?

10:25.503 --> 10:26.752
Because if I don't,

10:26.754 --> 10:29.639
he won't give my paper
to Stephen Hawking.

10:29.641 --> 10:31.340
- He's a famous physicist.
- Yeah, yeah,

10:31.342 --> 10:35.761
I know, he's the wheelchair dude
who invented time.

10:37.681 --> 10:40.016
That's close enough.

10:40.018 --> 10:41.400
I don't understand,
why doesn't Howard

10:41.402 --> 10:43.052
just introduce you to the guy?

10:43.054 --> 10:47.290
Because he's punishing me for
being a "condescending jerk."

10:47.292 --> 10:49.892
You don't think
I'm condescending, do you?

10:49.894 --> 10:51.694
Well, kind of...

10:51.696 --> 10:54.163
Oh, I'm sorry,
condescending means...

10:54.165 --> 10:55.414
I know what it means.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.783
And yes,
you love correcting people

10:57.785 --> 10:58.951
and putting them down.

10:58.953 --> 11:00.369
<i>Au contraire.</i>

11:00.371 --> 11:03.506
When I correct people
I am raising them up.

11:05.459 --> 11:08.211
You should know, I do it
for you more than anyone.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.381
Come on, you do it
to feel superior.

11:12.383 --> 11:13.549
I see that twinkle in your eye

11:13.551 --> 11:15.885
when someone says "who"
instead of "whom"

11:15.887 --> 11:18.938
or thinks the moon is a planet.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.959
Or <i>Don Quixote</i> is a book
about a donkey named Hotay.

11:22.961 --> 11:24.994
See,

11:24.996 --> 11:26.229
there it is,
there's that twinkle.

11:26.231 --> 11:27.396
Well, I can't help it.

11:27.398 --> 11:29.649
That's an involuntary twinkle.

11:30.534 --> 11:32.735
What do you want me
to tell you, Sheldon?

11:32.737 --> 11:34.153
I want you to tell me

11:34.155 --> 11:36.622
that Howard is being mean to me
for no reason.

11:36.624 --> 11:39.992
Fine, Howard is being mean
to you for no reason.

11:39.994 --> 11:41.827
I knew it.

11:44.831 --> 11:46.465
(groans)

11:46.467 --> 11:47.700
What's the matter?

11:47.702 --> 11:49.285
Every time I spend the night,

11:49.287 --> 11:53.539
your mom slaps me on the behind
and says, "Go get 'em."

11:53.541 --> 11:55.675
It's not her fault.

11:55.677 --> 11:58.761
She's getting
hormone replacement therapy.

12:01.064 --> 12:04.100
Makes her crazy horny.

12:04.818 --> 12:06.352
Check this out,
I got Sheldon

12:06.354 --> 12:08.738
to wear the French
maid's costume.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.606
Oh, my God,
that's terrible.

12:10.608 --> 12:13.726
Hey, I gave you
first crack at it.

12:13.728 --> 12:15.444
Why are you doing that?

12:15.446 --> 12:16.896
You're being mean to him.

12:16.898 --> 12:18.314
He's mean to me all the time.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.700
You've heard him tease me
about not having a doctorate.

12:20.702 --> 12:22.501
If you don't want
to get teased about that,

12:22.503 --> 12:23.669
get a doctorate.

12:26.656 --> 12:28.925
I have one; they're great.

12:29.843 --> 12:32.728
Oh, come on, the
man torments me.

12:32.730 --> 12:33.662
I'm just letting him have

12:33.664 --> 12:35.648
a little taste
of his own medicine.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.166
It's not the same thing.

12:37.168 --> 12:38.718
Sheldon doesn't know
when he's being mean

12:38.720 --> 12:40.553
because the part of his brain
that should know

12:40.555 --> 12:43.472
is getting a wedgie
from the rest of his brain.

12:46.193 --> 12:48.361
Fine, I'll just make him do
a couple more things,

12:48.363 --> 12:49.312
then I'll stop.

12:49.314 --> 12:51.180
No, you have to stop now.

12:51.182 --> 12:54.216
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Bernadette, I want to remind you,

12:54.218 --> 12:58.487
you promised to take me
dress shopping tomorrow!

12:58.489 --> 13:01.874
Oh, damn.

13:01.876 --> 13:05.294
I'm sorry,
I can't make it,

13:05.296 --> 13:09.165
but Sheldon's going
to go with you!

13:14.921 --> 13:18.090
And that's the last thing
you do to him.

13:21.345 --> 13:25.514
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Sheldon!

13:25.516 --> 13:28.784
I need your help!

13:28.786 --> 13:31.454
What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

13:31.456 --> 13:32.822
It's this dress!

13:32.824 --> 13:37.476
When I put my front in,
my back pops out!

13:39.579 --> 13:44.583
When I put my back in,
my front pops out!

13:44.585 --> 13:48.371
It's like trying to keep
two dogs in a bathtub!

13:50.207 --> 13:52.291
What do you want me to do?

13:52.293 --> 13:54.794
We're gonna have
to work as a team!

13:54.796 --> 13:59.365
Get in here, grab a handful,
and start stuffing!

14:05.756 --> 14:08.708
SHELDON:
I'm not sure how to do this.

14:08.710 --> 14:13.429
It's easy, just pretend you're
putting away a sleeping bag.

14:14.948 --> 14:19.768
Sleeping bags don't usually
sweat this much, but okay.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.704
Now zip me up.

14:21.706 --> 14:23.456
Oh, if we squeeze
you any tighter,

14:23.458 --> 14:25.991
you may turn
into a diamond.

14:28.261 --> 14:31.881
You're right,
who am I kidding?

14:31.883 --> 14:34.950
You should have seen me
when I was young, Sheldon.

14:34.952 --> 14:39.839
The fellas used to line up
and bring me boxes of candy.

14:40.724 --> 14:43.109
Why did I eat it all?!

14:46.396 --> 14:47.980
Would you hold me?

14:47.982 --> 14:51.350
Oh... no, you know, I'm not
really the holding kind of...

14:51.352 --> 14:53.936
Oh!

14:56.189 --> 14:58.157
Oh, guys, I just remembered.

14:58.159 --> 15:01.643
I got you
some Hawking souvenirs.

15:01.645 --> 15:02.811
What are these?

15:02.813 --> 15:04.980
Gears and springs
from his wheelchair.

15:04.982 --> 15:06.449
Pretty cool, huh?

15:07.317 --> 15:10.035
Wow, that's amazing.

15:10.037 --> 15:12.204
I made an adjustment
on the motor drive

15:12.206 --> 15:14.423
and when I was putting it
back together

15:14.425 --> 15:17.927
I could not for the life of me
figure out where they went.

15:19.996 --> 15:22.264
(sighs)
I did it.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.600
Had to go
to three clothing stores,

15:24.602 --> 15:29.472
but we finally found a dress
that could envelop your mother.

15:30.557 --> 15:31.673
I should have sent you

15:31.675 --> 15:34.059
to the custom car cover place
in Altadena.

15:34.061 --> 15:35.978
They have her pattern on file.

15:35.980 --> 15:37.279
(laughs)

15:37.281 --> 15:38.481
Humorous.

15:39.116 --> 15:41.350
Now will you
please present

15:41.352 --> 15:43.569
my paper
to Professor Hawking?

15:43.571 --> 15:44.653
I don't know.

15:44.655 --> 15:45.955
Oh, for heaven's sake.

15:45.957 --> 15:49.291
I did your laundry, I pee-pee-
proofed your belt buckles,

15:49.293 --> 15:50.409
I, I even sprained

15:50.411 --> 15:54.046
my wrist helping
your mother lift her bosom.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.552
All right, Sheldon,

15:59.554 --> 16:02.505
there's only one thing left
I want you to do.

16:02.507 --> 16:04.140
Don't worry, it's an easy one.

16:04.142 --> 16:05.458
Okay.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.309
Give me a compliment.

16:07.311 --> 16:09.595
Fine.

16:09.597 --> 16:11.397
You have very tiny hands.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.986
No... about my job.

16:16.988 --> 16:20.639
I want you to tell me
I'm good at what I do.

16:20.641 --> 16:23.209
You're obviously good
at what you do.

16:23.211 --> 16:26.428
Well, then why are you
always ripping on me?

16:26.430 --> 16:28.581
Oh, I understand
the confusion.

16:28.583 --> 16:31.750
I have never said that you are
not good at what you do.

16:31.752 --> 16:36.121
It's just that what you do
is not worth doing.

16:40.844 --> 16:42.878
It's nicer than anything
he's ever said to me.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.014
I'd take it and run.

16:46.349 --> 16:48.334
Thank you, Sheldon.

16:48.336 --> 16:50.236
Now will you give
my paper to Hawking?

16:50.238 --> 16:51.504
Sorry, I can't.

16:51.506 --> 16:52.705
What, why not?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.807
I gave it to him three days ago.

16:54.809 --> 16:57.309
He was really
impressed.

16:57.311 --> 16:58.744
He wants to meet you.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.748
All right, then.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.099
Thank you, Howard.

17:05.102 --> 17:07.736
Please let
Professor Hawking know

17:07.738 --> 17:11.440
that I'm available
at his earliest convenience.

17:11.442 --> 17:14.193
I thought he might be
a little more excited.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.194
Give it a second.

17:15.195 --> 17:17.546
(Sheldon whooping wildly)

17:27.752 --> 17:29.558
Professor Hawking,

17:29.560 --> 17:32.912
it's an honor and a privilege
to meet you, sir.

17:32.914 --> 17:35.698
(beeping)

17:35.700 --> 17:37.950
I know.

17:38.952 --> 17:42.571
I want to thank you for
taking time to see me.

17:42.573 --> 17:43.522
(beeps)

17:43.524 --> 17:44.607
My pleasure.

17:44.609 --> 17:48.294
I enjoyed reading
your paper very much.

17:48.296 --> 17:50.863
You clearly have
a brilliant mind.

17:50.865 --> 17:54.400
I know.
(beeping)

17:54.402 --> 17:58.537
Your thesis that the Higgs boson
is a black hole

17:58.539 --> 18:02.341
accelerating backwards
through time is fascinating.

18:02.343 --> 18:04.426
Thank you.

18:04.428 --> 18:08.280
It just-- it came to me
one morning in the shower.

18:08.282 --> 18:10.833
(beeps)

18:10.835 --> 18:12.134
That's nice.

18:12.136 --> 18:15.154
Too bad it's wrong.

18:17.040 --> 18:20.442
What do you mean wrong?

18:20.444 --> 18:21.577
(beeps)

18:21.579 --> 18:24.930
You made an arithmetic mistake
on page two.

18:24.932 --> 18:27.216
(beeping)

18:27.218 --> 18:30.686
It was quite the boner.

18:32.472 --> 18:36.008
No, no... that
can't be right.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.878
I-I don't make
arithmetic mistakes.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.913
Are you saying I do?

18:40.915 --> 18:41.881
Oh, no,

18:41.883 --> 18:43.315
no, no, of course not.

18:43.317 --> 18:44.600
It's just, I
was thinking...

18:44.602 --> 18:47.186
Oh, gosh, golly,
I made a boo-boo,

18:47.188 --> 18:50.272
and I gave it to
Stephen Hawking.

18:55.547 --> 18:57.882
Great, another fainter.
