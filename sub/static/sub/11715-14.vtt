WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:04.880
Here you go.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.089
Thanks. Appreciate it.

00:06.131 --> 00:06.966
You got it.

00:08.968 --> 00:10.302
Oh! Check her out.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.806
What, do you think
she's on your team?

00:15.223 --> 00:16.433
We'd be lucky
to have her.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.020
Is it just me,
or have there been, lik,

00:20.061 --> 00:22.356
tons of hot girls
everywhere lately?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.482
I can't say.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.610
My senses have
been dulled by
years of monogamy.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.281
My hormones
are going nuts.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.575
I've officially crossedr
from the nausea stage
of pregnancy

00:33.617 --> 00:34.910
into the horny stage.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.745
Nauseous then horny...

00:36.787 --> 00:38.163
That's the reverse
of Audrey's process.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.291
I'm serious, man.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.376
I'm going crazy.
Well...

00:43.919 --> 00:45.713
Too bad you can't do
anything about it.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.547
Who says?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.344
I can't believe
we have to have
this conversation.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.762
We're paying you
to be our surrogate.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.389
So, as long as
our kid's in there

00:55.430 --> 00:56.765
that whole area is
closed for business.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.978
Uh, you are not the boss
of my business.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.398
Well, actually,
for the next
five months, I am.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.608
Um, just think of it
as a, uh,

01:06.650 --> 01:08.569
crowded night club.
No one new gets in

01:08.610 --> 01:09.778
until someone
comes out.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.865
All right. Well,
before you install

01:14.115 --> 01:16.410
a velvet rope
and a bouncer
down there...

01:16.451 --> 01:18.203
I mean, it's not
really an issue.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.455
With your giant-headed
baby inside me,

01:20.497 --> 01:21.957
I don't know who'd be
into me anyway.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.293
It is pretty
unappealing.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.088
Although,
the upper deck's
never looked better.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.053
I know, right?
I'm kind of
turning myself on.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.389
Speaking of which,
time for another drink.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.432
Hide the kid.
(SIGHS)

01:42.436 --> 01:43.186
Hey.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.523
See that, uh, redhead
with the rack over ther?

01:48.734 --> 01:49.985
She's been
checking you out.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.361
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.865
You should
send her a drink.
Good call.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.491
Can I send some white wine
to the woman over there?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.243
She looks more like
a Scotch, beer
kind of gal.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.291
Hey, you know
what would be
a class move?

02:04.332 --> 02:09.254
Send over
some nachos.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.756
You're the cheapest
man alive.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.632
(SIGHS)

02:13.675 --> 02:14.676
Cheap like a fox.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.931
Oh, don't forget
her nachos.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.981
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:30.442 --> 02:32.778
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not sc?

02:34.905 --> 02:38.826
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:39.868 --> 02:42.037
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:51.296 --> 02:53.090
Here you go,
double whiskey.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.967
Enjoy your breakfast.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.804
Thank you.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.849
Is this one of those, u,
Leaving Las Vegas thin,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.600
where you take a look
at your life

03:03.642 --> 03:04.935
and decide to drink
yourself to death?

03:04.977 --> 03:06.061
She asked hopefully.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.983
No, I'm getting
a wisdom tooth
pulled today,

03:11.025 --> 03:12.151
and I'm prepping.
Hmm.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
Um, excuse me, could I t
a side order of fruit?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.532
No need. We got
the melons right here.

03:21.702 --> 03:32.295
I know, right? I've got,
like, the biggest boobs
in the world.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.254
All right, grow up,
Russell.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
That is just...

03:35.298 --> 03:37.718
That's nature's way of
preparing for the baby.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.638
More like nature's way
of preparing me
to pound one out.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.348
Well, I got to go.
(CHUCKLES)

03:43.390 --> 03:44.683
Hey, where you going?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.518
Uh, to meet
a new friend.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.311
It's the, uh, waitress
from the bar the other .

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
Wait. When did that happen?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
Um, after you got
kicked out

03:51.815 --> 03:53.734
for trying to get that y
to buy me a surf and tu.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.737
She and I...
We had a nice little ch,

03:57.779 --> 03:58.989
and, uh, I got her numb.
Really?

04:00.032 --> 04:01.449
Even after she saw
that whole mess?

04:03.202 --> 04:04.619
Also known as our child.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.916
She didn't seem to have
a problem with it.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.584
So we are seeing a movie
at the Alexandria.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.794
Huh.
RUSSELL: Ooh, interesting.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.838
You know,
the Alexandria is uptow.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.799
After the film,
might the two of you

04:17.841 --> 04:21.595
be heading in the
opposite direction?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.346
Stayed an extra 30 seconds,
paid the price.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.683
Brenda and a waitress?
Russell likey.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.439
Nothing's going to happ.
I made that clear last .
Her area is off-limits.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.441
(CHUCKLES)

04:34.482 --> 04:36.944
Jeff, Brenda
is a grown woman.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.987
Whatever she does
with her "area"
is her decision.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.532
And if she and her fried
would like me to film i.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.410
Again, her call.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.914
Oh, my God.
You are disgusting.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.332
You are like
a cockroach.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.919
Hmm. Pardon me?
What kind of roach?

04:57.547 --> 04:59.841
Uh, in my defense,
this is not my first on.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.559
(GASPS)
Oh, hi, Barbara.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.894
Hi, Lily.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.104
Oh, isn't she so cute?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.315
You know,
I'm having a baby soon.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.692
Oh, congratulations, Audrey.
When are you due?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.820
Oh, no, no.
I'm not having it.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.696
We're actually using
a friend of my husband's
as our surrogate.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.074
But it's not weird
or anything.
She's a lesbian.

05:24.116 --> 05:27.119
Mommy, what's a lesbian?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.912
Thanks. I've been meanig
to explain that to her.

05:28.954 --> 05:29.746
Sorry.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.416
Oh, that is such a nicel
you have there.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.169
What is her name?

05:35.210 --> 05:36.170
Dolly.
Well...

05:37.254 --> 05:39.673
It is very nice
to meet you, Dol...

05:40.465 --> 05:41.382
Mommy!

05:42.759 --> 05:44.719
Crap! I mean, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.805
Here, I'll fix her.
That's okay.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.765
Now we... Now we're
going to take her to
the doll hospital, okay?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.100
Yes, yes.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.728
I am going to take her
to the doll hospital.

05:54.855 --> 05:55.856
I'm going to take her te
right now.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.940
Watch me go,
here I go.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.735
No, there's
an actual hospital
at the Doll Town Store.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.113
That's where
they have to go
to be repaired.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.906
Oh, seriously?
Yeah.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.408
Oh, okay. I'll take
her there for you.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.494
Oh, okay. Thanks.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.997
Sure.
No problem, no problem.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.414
I'll have her back to yu
this afternoon, good as new.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.291
Okay, bye-bye, Lily.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.125
(GASPS)

06:22.966 --> 06:23.842
Oh, hey.
Hey.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.262
Hey, Jen, um,
you remember when you said

06:28.429 --> 06:29.931
that I wasn't a tough,
edgy kind of guy?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.352
Yes. You were wearing
an avocado exfoliating mask.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.147
Yeah, and I glowed
for a week.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.277
Well, take a look
who is tough and edgy n.

06:43.111 --> 06:43.820
Huh?

06:46.698 --> 06:48.407
Wha... No... Wha...
Are you...
Are you scared?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.829
You scared,
yet a little turned on?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.413
You got a tattoo
because I said

06:54.455 --> 06:56.541
you weren't edgy?
Oh, yeah.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.625
It's temporary, yo.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.172
Why barbed wire?
Because

07:03.131 --> 07:04.799
it's forbidden.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.467
It's not forbidden.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.262
You can buy it
at the hardware store.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.512
Yeah, but they keep it
behind the counter,

07:09.554 --> 07:13.850
and you have to
ask the guy.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.894
Plus, the real one's gog
to have even sharper barbs.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.897
Come on, please,
don't get a real one.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.109
That's the wrong thing
to say to a rebel, baby.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.484
Now I only want
to do it more.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.826
(CHUCKLES)

07:33.536 --> 07:34.329
(SIGHS)

07:35.580 --> 07:36.748
Gallant is such a wuss.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.626
Goofus, that's the guy
you want to be.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.798
Sir, Goofus is eating
all the cookies himself,

07:44.839 --> 07:46.800
leaving none for anyone.
You know what?

07:46.841 --> 07:50.137
I'm not having
this argument again.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.554
What's up your tepee,
geroni-mope?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.058
Hmm. Seems like
appropriate gratitude

07:56.768 --> 07:59.980
for making me give up
my Saturday to babysit u
at the dentist.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.898
Really? What else
would you be doing?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.442
Sitting at home,
reading a book
about glasses?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.525
(CHUCKLES)

08:06.820 --> 08:08.488
Yes. I'm farsighted and
deserve contempt for it.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.033
Hey. Hello.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.495
Uh, just to confirm,
we will be using

08:16.455 --> 08:18.039
all available
sedatives on me?

08:19.166 --> 08:22.127
Absolutely.
Okay.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.628
There's a switch.

08:23.670 --> 08:30.551
A woman giving you
knockout drugs.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.719
What...
What are you doing?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.639
What Goofus would do.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.521
But she just said
you were getting
a sedative, sir.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.358
Hey, I'm having
a wisdom tooth out.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.151
It's major surgery.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.280
It's not like your coun,
where they just line yop

08:50.322 --> 09:00.957
and have a goat
kick you in the mouth.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.335
I can't believe it costs
50 bucks to fix a doll.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.920
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Soon it will be
a real baby.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.006
Kind of a nice way
to practice
taking care of one.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.466
Oh, wait.
Hold the door!

09:09.508 --> 09:11.718
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Here! No, no.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.470
Oh, you've got
to be kidding.
No, no, no, no.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.346
(SCREAMING)

09:24.231 --> 09:26.566
Don't worry.
Not real.

09:26.607 --> 09:27.984
Oh, my heart's
pounding, too, bro.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.247
Uh, no. Honestly,
I didn't think you
were going to call.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.456
Well, I'm glad I did.
Me, too.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.251
Oh, my God!
You guys are here, too.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.668
Oh, my God.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.963
Jeff, what are you
doing here?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.798
Are you kidding me?
I'm a huge fan of this .

09:52.300 --> 09:53.468
You just try
keeping me away from

09:55.136 --> 09:57.055
"an Icelandic woman's te
of unrequited love
and redemption"...

09:58.765 --> 09:59.640
Subtitled.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.769
You're going
to hate this.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.687
You said The Expendables
was too think-y.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.189
They weren't
expendable.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.067
They were very necessary
to the operation.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.610
Uh, you remember Andrea
from the other night?

10:10.651 --> 10:12.446
I do, and, um...

10:12.487 --> 10:13.572
Regarding my tip, um,

10:15.282 --> 10:18.659
I did not expect
to be seeing you again.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.994
Well, don't
worry about it.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.246
I'm going to go
get us some popcorn.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.289
Great.
Extra butter.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.039
Okay.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.667
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:26.709 --> 10:27.794
I said
no monkey business.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.213
Not until after
the baby is born.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.756
We discussed this
at the bar.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.216
Look, I'm on
a date, okay?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.094
And I would like
for it to go well.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.678
Oh. I don't want it
to go at all.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.182
Well, that's
not your call.
So beat it.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.184
No, no, no.
I'm not going anywhere.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.479
I'm staying
right here.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.398
To do what?
To try to prevent me
from hooking up?

10:48.440 --> 10:51.109
Are you actually trying
to beaver-dam me?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.486
That's awesome.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.570
Uh, yeah.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.365
The velvet rope is up.
I'm the bouncer.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.866
And your little
waitress friend,

10:58.908 --> 10:59.909
not on the list.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.870
Jeff...
Want to go in?

11:02.912 --> 11:03.997
Yeah, let's do this.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.047
Whoa!

11:18.470 --> 11:19.887
Thank you so much.
Uh, I'll take him
from here.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.055
Here we go, sir.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.265
Mm-hmm.
All right.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.141
(GRUNTS)

11:24.851 --> 11:25.602
(SIGHS)

11:26.645 --> 11:28.563
He can't eat
for an hour.
Mm-hmm.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.730
Oh, and he shouldn't
lift anything heavy.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.274
(MURMURS)

11:34.528 --> 11:36.029
What did he say?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.531
He said,
"Not lift anything heav?

11:38.323 --> 11:39.533
"How am I going to pee?"

11:45.079 --> 11:45.872
Right.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.627
Now, give him
more aspirin if it
starts to swell or thro.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.170
If it starts...
If it starts to...

11:53.004 --> 12:03.348
Perhaps we should just .

12:03.390 --> 12:05.766
So...
Did you enjoy the film?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.768
I did. I did. I actually
found it pretty moving.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.146
Good.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

12:10.188 --> 12:12.399
Those ugly people
sure seemed fired up
about the wheat harvest.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.277
So you want to get
something to eat?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.238
Yeah, I would love to.
Oh, me, too.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.614
I'm starved.
I could eat that moose

12:20.865 --> 12:23.410
that kept popping up
in that farmer's dream.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.328
Oh, Jeff, look,
Audrey's texting me.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.996
She says she needs you
home right away.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.165
Oh, wait.
Uh, she just texted me,.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.958
"Ignore the text
I sent Brenda.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.961
"Stay out as late
as you like."

12:34.003 --> 12:35.589
Where are we going?

12:35.630 --> 12:36.715
There's a Chinese place
across the street.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.091
Aren't you vegan?

12:38.132 --> 12:38.966
Yeah, but
I can make it work.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.885
No, no. No.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.846
Let's go get vegan food!

12:45.306 --> 12:48.935
How does that sound, Je?

12:48.976 --> 12:51.854
Sounds like a love lettr
to my colon.

12:51.896 --> 12:52.813
Let's eat.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.946
Yes. Thank you so much
for drooling on my
favorite sweater.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.698
I suppose I can just hae
my grandmother knit me
another...

13:01.740 --> 13:02.699
From the grave.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.076
(SIGHS)

13:07.621 --> 13:08.622
Oh! None of that!

13:12.083 --> 13:13.334
Okay, sir, we're here.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.170
Hmm? What's that?
An offer to pay?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.338
Oh, no, please, let me.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.258
Thank you.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.636
I'll come round
and get you, sir.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.434
Oh! Oh, dear.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.025
Two trips to
the doll hospital
in one day,

13:38.067 --> 13:39.360
that's got
to be a record.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.613
Oh, things happen,
just like in life.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.325
But a good mom
learns from her mistake,

13:45.366 --> 13:46.785
isn't that right, Dolly?
(CHUCKLES)

13:47.201 --> 13:48.161
Hello?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.331
Oh! Oh, God!
Hello?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
Ah, yes. Uh, hello.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.558
Um, I'm trying
to locate an item

14:10.600 --> 14:15.896
I left in
one of your cabs.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.607
Valuable?
No, it's my boss.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.570
Yes, I'll hold.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.738
JENNIFER:
That thing is wrecked.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.031
Just buy a new one.

14:25.072 --> 14:25.948
Look...

14:27.992 --> 14:29.494
Her head is just
a little bit caved in, ?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.662
I think
if I pry her eye out,

14:31.788 --> 14:33.331
I can pop her head out
from the inside.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.377
I like her that way.
I think she looks badas.

14:38.753 --> 14:39.879
Oh, yes.
Uh, thank you.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.715
His height?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.092
Hmm, well, I know
he's not tall enough

14:45.134 --> 14:46.636
to ride the Matterhorn
at Disneyland.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.681
He moped in the teacups
for hours.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.185
Hair color, did you ask?
Well, that would be
Nice 'n Easy number 46.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.019
Eye color?

14:56.062 --> 14:56.855
Black?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.985
I've never seen his eye.
He's always staring
at my boobs.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.028
Is beady a color?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.867
Look, if you find
a drunken troll making
crude sexual innuendoes,

15:09.534 --> 15:10.618
please do call us.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.621
Well, I better
get going.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.791
I got an appointment
to go ink the guns.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.127
All right, that's i.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.380
Ow! Ow!
Why'd you do that?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.216
Well, if you think
that hurt,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.093
imagine an electric neee
stabbing you for hours.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.178
Hours?

15:31.765 --> 15:32.891
Yes. And there's blood.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.393
Mine?

15:37.812 --> 15:38.813
Yeah, lots of it.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.443
I think I'm just
going to grow, like,
a badass 'stache.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.237
Oh, yes!

15:49.282 --> 15:50.074
(GASPS)

15:54.871 --> 16:03.003
I think it's time to
talk to her about the bg
dollhouse in the sky.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.589
Oh, that was so good.
I know.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.592
Jeff, how was your meal?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.428
Nothing better
after Icelandic cinema

16:10.470 --> 16:11.805
than mung beans
and a shamburger.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.851
Really? 'Cause it lookse
you barely touched it.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.478
I'm saving room
for dessert.
Carob pudding.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.064
It's getting kind of la.
I guess...

16:23.524 --> 16:25.025
Everyone's going to go
their separate ways.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.110
So, Andrea,
share a cab?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.072
Actually, um,
I was going to
ask Andrea

16:30.114 --> 16:31.157
if she wanted
to come back
to my place,

16:31.198 --> 16:32.909
maybe have
a glass of wine?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.786
Oh, sure. I'd love to.
Well, I'm in. This...

16:37.747 --> 16:38.998
Kale shake's
not doing it.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.168
It's doing something.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.507
No, Jeff, I meant
just me and Andrea.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.635
Oh. I will walk you,
make sure that

16:51.803 --> 16:53.638
you two delicate flowers
get back safely.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.931
I served
in the Israeli Army.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.223
Ah...

16:58.351 --> 17:00.353
The Middle East.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.522
There's a topic
we could bat around
till the wee hours.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.108
Okay, Jeff,
I'm just going to
step in here.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.444
I really think
that it is time
for you to go.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.780
Okay, come on, what's...
What's going on?

17:10.822 --> 17:12.072
All right, Andrea...
(SIGHS)

17:13.407 --> 17:14.909
She's not a lesbian.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.578
She and I are...
We're a thing.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.290
That's right.
I put that baby in there
the old-fashioned way.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.292
And she loved it.

17:23.835 --> 17:24.752
Oh, my God.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.339
Look, Jeff here is worrd

17:29.507 --> 17:30.925
that if something physil
were to happen

17:32.176 --> 17:34.679
between you and me,
that it might interfere

17:34.721 --> 17:36.180
with the baby that I am
just carrying for him.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.641
Oh. Well,
maybe I should go.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.935
Oh, that'd be great.
No, stay.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.938
Jeff, first of all..

17:45.523 --> 17:46.983
And I really mean this.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.028
You're an idiot.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.779
That's a little harsh.
No, it's not.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.614
Oh, hey, brah. Yeah,

17:53.656 --> 17:55.408
that carob pudding's
for you, man.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.995
Go eat that
in your van.

17:59.037 --> 17:59.787
Oh, God.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.205
Jeff, please.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.417
We have known each other
forever.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.419
Do you really think
that I would do anythin,

18:06.460 --> 18:09.756
even for a second,
that could possibly
harm this baby?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.215
I guess not, no.
Okay.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.051
Then I ask you... No.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.137
I beg you, go.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.683
Maybe we should let
Andrea decide...

18:20.725 --> 18:21.475
Go!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.104
All right, I will,
but you know what?

18:25.145 --> 18:27.189
Not before I say this,
all right?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.108
If you guys are
going to start up
with the horseplay...

18:30.401 --> 18:32.028
Brenda,
you can go nuts on her,

18:32.070 --> 18:33.905
you know, but, Andrea,

18:33.947 --> 18:38.325
when it's your
turn to do stuff,
just don't.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.119
Is he serious?

18:40.160 --> 18:43.748
Oh, yeah, I pull that
on Audrey all the time.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.041
Just pretend
you fell asleep.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.296
(SIGHS)

18:51.338 --> 18:52.924
And yet,
Audrey is still straigh.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.009
Really proves
it's not a choice.

18:55.051 --> 18:55.843
Mm-hmm.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.346
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.598
Okay, this is
your building.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.186
Your friend is on his wy
to meet you.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.022
Why don't we
just stay right here
until he arrives?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.651
You're the best, Timmy.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.277
Oh, sorry, sir,
I'm not, uh...

19:14.194 --> 19:15.404
You know what?
You're right.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.782
I don't thank you enoug.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.702
Truth is, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.372
You're really
my best friend.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.292
I love you.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.839
Thank you so much.
I'll take him from here.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.756
This is for you.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.341
All right, sir.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.635
Let's get you home.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.262
When did you
start driving a cab?

19:42.098 --> 19:43.307
Ah, yes.
We all look alike.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.434
Very original.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.980
Anything nice
you'd like to
say to me, sir,

19:49.022 --> 19:50.898
considering I've given p
my entire Saturday for ?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.566
Hmm? No?
Didn't think so.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.078
So you actually thought
you could talk them
out of getting together?

20:04.120 --> 20:08.041
I know, right? I'm geney
arguing the pro side of
two chicks hooking up.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.250
Where are you
making this argument?

20:10.292 --> 20:14.047
Wherever it needs
to be made.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.173
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.468
Listen...

20:22.346 --> 20:23.973
Let's... Let's just see
if Jeff and Audrey think

20:24.015 --> 20:27.060
this 'stache
makes me look edgy.

20:27.101 --> 20:31.981
It doesn't.
You look like
a '70s porn star.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.027
Yeah, well,
from what I understand,
those guys got tons of .

20:36.069 --> 20:38.071
Okay? Now, just don't...
Don't tell them it's fa.

20:38.863 --> 20:39.989
They saw you yesterday!

20:43.951 --> 20:45.953
What's up?
