00:03.560 --> 00:05.961
MR. KETCH: <i>Mrs. Winchester,
I believe you're drawn to danger.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:07.121
Drink?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.490
Hey, you talk to Mom, lately?

00:09.640 --> 00:12.086
Oh, I shouldn't worry about your mum.
Her and Ketch make quite the team.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.765
DEAN: <i>Would you want your mom
working with him?</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:15.922
Well, that was unexpected.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.524
Dr. Hess. I didn't think you left London.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.762
I have been tasked by the other elders

00:20.960 --> 00:24.806
to fix this rapidly
deteriorating situation.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.121
Dr. Hess...

00:27.440 --> 00:28.771
<i>DR. HESS:
These hunters are out of control.</i>

00:29.000 --> 00:31.844
Exterminate them.
The brothers Winchester in particular.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.564
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.687
- What?
- I got work tomorrow, so...

00:59.960 --> 01:02.406
No, dude. Stick around. Have another beer.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.040
Enjoy the show.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.490
You know you're a freak, right?

01:13.320 --> 01:14.321
Oh, yeah.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.486
Cheers, bud.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.561
Hey!

02:11.200 --> 02:12.406
Hey!

02:15.360 --> 02:17.408
Ah! Man! Dude. Daryn!

02:18.120 --> 02:19.121
What is this, man?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.365
<i>Hey, real funny, Daryn!</i>

02:45.000 --> 02:46.729
No. No.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.961
No, no, no!

03:03.800 --> 03:05.086
CASTIEL: <i>This is my voicemail.</i>

03:05.760 --> 03:08.366
- Come on.
- CASTIEL: <i>Make your voice a mail.</i>

03:08.880 --> 03:11.770
Cass, it's me. I've been trying to
get ahold of you for days.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.641
I don't know what's going on,
but we got a line on Dagon

03:15.920 --> 03:18.446
and we got our asses handed to us,
even with the Colt.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.400
So, could really use the backup.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.726
Just call me back.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.971
Still no luck with Cass, huh?

03:27.720 --> 03:28.926
Yeah, still AWOL.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.962
All right, so let's find him.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.011
I've been trying, Sam.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.651
The GPS on his phone is turned off,

03:36.880 --> 03:38.006
and there's nothing in the system

03:38.160 --> 03:41.050
about some weird guy in a trench coat
getting arrested or turning up dead.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.921
SAM: <i>Right.</i>

03:44.440 --> 03:45.805
Dean, it's Cass.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.164
<i>I mean, this isn't the first time
he's dropped off the map, you know?</i>

03:49.320 --> 03:51.561
And whatever's happening, he'll be fine.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.721
He always is.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.201
Yeah.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.201
<i>What about you?</i>

03:59.360 --> 04:00.771
You got anything there, Reading Rainbow?

04:00.920 --> 04:03.605
I stayed up all night going through
every book we have on demons,

04:03.800 --> 04:05.882
and it turns out
we have a lot of books on demons.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.401
Anything on Dagon?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.881
Mentions here and there,
but nothing we can use.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.164
I guess the, uh, Princes of Hell are
pretty good at staying off the radar.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.408
Well, yeah,
isn't that kind of their thing?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.807
Hmm. Just got an email from Mick.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.681
It's a case.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.002
Good.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.011
Looks like a guy named Jarrod Hayes
disappeared in Tomahawk, Wisconsin,

04:28.400 --> 04:29.401
a week ago.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.045
<i>No witnesses. No body.</i>

04:31.320 --> 04:33.846
- But Mick says this place has a history.
- Meaning?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.043
Well, it means
a lot of people go missing in Tomahawk.

04:36.280 --> 04:41.286
One a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997,
and then nothing until now.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.886
So, 20 years?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.201
SAM: <i>Yeah.</i>

04:44.400 --> 04:46.880
So, maybe they're starting up again?
Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?

04:47.560 --> 04:50.291
Well, one way to find out.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.601
It's time.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.803
I'm sorry, but why are the Feds
interested in Jarrod Hayes?

05:16.720 --> 05:17.926
Just following orders.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.530
Yeah. Um...

05:21.320 --> 05:23.049
So, what can you tell us about the case?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.404
Well, nothing much to tell.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.971
Jarrod and his friends
were hanging out at Weather Top.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.291
This make-out spot
the kids use out in the woods.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.931
And then he ditched his pals
to hoof it home.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.001
Never made it.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.208
So, somebody snagged him?

05:42.720 --> 05:44.006
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

05:44.320 --> 05:47.767
Look, maybe Jarrod did get got.
We're working every lead.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.207
But you ask me, he just bailed.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.441
And why would he do that?

05:51.760 --> 05:53.364
Jarrod's had it rough.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.886
Mom left years ago.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.810
And his dad... Well, let's just say.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.048
Jarrod fell down the stairs a lot.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.686
- If you know what I mean.
- SAM: <i>Wait a second.</i>

06:01.040 --> 06:02.371
If you knew he was being abused,

06:02.520 --> 06:03.965
- why didn't you...
- We tried.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.845
<i>Try and take a child from his parents,</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:08.924
even if they're the worst people
in the world, it's not easy.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.285
Did you talk to his old man?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.568
SHERIFF BISHOP: <i>Can't. Not really.</i>

06:14.920 --> 06:19.608
Guy stroked out a couple years ago.
Breathes through a tube. Heh.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.884
Guess who gets to take care of him?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.610
<i>Can you imagine
having to spoon-feed the guy</i>

06:23.760 --> 06:25.000
<i>that wailed on you for all those years?</i>

06:26.480 --> 06:28.562
Everybody's got a breaking point.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.088
If Jarrod did blow town,
I wouldn't blame him.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.284
You said that he was with friends
the night Jarrod went missing.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.965
Yeah, did any of them say anything?

06:36.320 --> 06:37.651
Nothing worth repeating.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.605
Ain't he precious?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.047
DEAN: Uh-huh.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.804
Any idea where we can find these friends?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.883
Oh, yeah. Sure.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.560
<i>Daryn Boston?</i>

06:57.440 --> 06:59.522
Agents Stark and Martell, FBI.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.411
Hell.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.721
DEAN: Yeah, no, it's cool.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.885
Medicinal purposes, right?

07:09.320 --> 07:11.004
Uh, yes?

07:11.520 --> 07:12.521
Yeah.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.249
We just, uh, wanted to talk about
the night Jarrod Hayes went missing.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.601
What about it?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.769
Well, the Sheriff says you were with him.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.042
Yeah, well,
the Sheriff is a jackass, all right?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.524
Look, he thinks Jarrod just skipped town.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.168
- You don't?
- I know he didn't.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.890
Did you tell that to the cops?

07:34.280 --> 07:36.248
Man, Sheriff Bishop's
not gonna believe me.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.924
We got history.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.241
"History"?

07:41.560 --> 07:44.643
Any time something happens in this town,
he brings me in for questioning.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.201
Why is that?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.725
- Why do you think?
- Right.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.570
Well, look, if you won't tell the Sheriff
what you saw, how about you tell us?

07:59.120 --> 08:01.202
JARROD: <i>Hey! Daryn!</i>

08:04.320 --> 08:07.608
Look,
I ran to save Jarrod, okay? But...

08:08.120 --> 08:09.281
JARROD: No, no, no!

08:10.440 --> 08:12.602
DARYN: <i>The monster, it got him.</i>

08:12.960 --> 08:13.961
"Monster"?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.245
Black Bill.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.248
Black Bill is a local urban legend.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.442
- Dates back more than 100 years.
- WAITRESS: Warm it up?

08:27.640 --> 08:28.641
Thank you.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.804
A folklore story from 1907
that mentions that...

08:32.799 --> 08:34.289
<i>Uh, back then,
he was called Black William.</i>

08:34.679 --> 08:38.446
So, it looks like sometime
between then and... Dude, focus.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.802
I am focused.
Yeah, Black Bill. What do you got?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.602
All right, well, he lives in the woods,
so he's like a local Jersey Devil.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.644
<i>And apparently, he has the head of a goat.</i>

08:48.920 --> 08:50.046
A goat?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.123
Like... Goat?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.441
Yeah, a goat.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.684
Well, maybe that's what Daryn saw.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.450
- Unless you think he was lying.
- Yeah. Be right back.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.809
Mmm. Nah, I think he's
a little too freaked out to be lying.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.566
So, we got a goat dude
with a name like a pirate,

09:03.840 --> 09:05.490
which is a little insane, even for us.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.489
And that bar is... Super high.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.570
- So, if it is real, what the hell is it?
- I'm not sure.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.087
I mean, there's tons of
human-animal hybrid lore

09:13.280 --> 09:14.930
<i>- dating back all the way to ancient Egypt.</i>
- Right, well,

09:15.080 --> 09:16.411
why don't you
figure out what the hell it is,

09:16.560 --> 09:17.925
and I'll figure out a way to kill it.
Okay?

09:18.640 --> 09:19.641
<i>SAM: All right.</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:21.561
Great.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.485
<i>- Don't wait up.</i>
- What?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.370
- I already figured out a way to kill it.
- How did you...

09:25.520 --> 09:27.090
Dean, we don't even know what "it" is.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.324
The Colt. Dusts anything.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.324
Work smarter, Sammy, not harder.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.526
Don't do the hot coffee thing.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.324
Boy, this coffee is hot.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.284
Kind of like...

09:39.480 --> 09:41.323
Hi.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.761
- What's your name?
- Carmen.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.204
Sorry.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.681
- Damn it, Pete!
- Daryn...

10:10.120 --> 10:14.011
I don't wanna be the bad guy here,
but you clocked in late.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.009
- Again.
- Yeah, and?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.931
And you're really
painting me in a corner here, pal.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.046
Look, I know that you and Jarrod,
you were close.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.201
And I liked him, too.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.562
He was a valued employee,
and he was a friend.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.246
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.364
'Cause after you put him on part-time,
he pretty much hated you.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.046
Well, I would say that
that was his prerogative.

10:39.280 --> 10:44.081
But you can't keep using him
as an excuse to blow off work. Okay?

10:44.640 --> 10:45.721
Yeah.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.407
Okay.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.800
Daryn. Daryn. One more thing.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.366
You gotta lay off the reefer.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.041
All right?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.090
At least for tomorrow.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.846
It's a big day.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.646
SAM: <i>Yeah. No, no, no. I understand.
Mmm-hmm.</i>

11:52.120 --> 11:54.930
<i>Yeah. Well... Yeah, gotta go.</i>

11:57.120 --> 11:59.521
I'll see you later. Yeah.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.561
Mmm.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.765
- Good night?
- Awesome.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.245
It was an awesome night. So awesome.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.081
- You gonna eat that?
- Uh...

12:18.320 --> 12:19.731
Guess not. Be my guest.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.323
I mean, would it kill you
to order pancakes?

12:22.480 --> 12:23.527
- Once?
- Okay, fine.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.767
- You...
- No, no. No.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.720
I'll deal.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.841
How was your night?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.845
Busy. A different kind of a busy,
but good.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.081
Right. Books.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.442
- Anything on goat dude?
- Yeah, little bit.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.004
I have some idea what we're dealing with.
Look at this.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.206
It's a satyr. Half man, half goat.
From Greek mythology.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.851
Oh, come on. This guy's adorable.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.041
He plays a freakin' flute.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.727
Yeah, Dean. That's Pan. It's his flute.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.045
So listen, satyrs are creatures
of uncontrollable lust.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.886
They would lead people to the woods
for massive orgies.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.041
Nice.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.840
And when the fun was over,
the satyr would, quote,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.128
"Feast upon the flesh of his victims"

13:06.360 --> 13:09.728
"until his belly was full to bursting
with their moist, slippery meat."

13:11.720 --> 13:12.767
That's descriptive.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.883
Uh...
All right, what do we do?

13:15.080 --> 13:18.129
Well, I was thinking that
maybe we could go talk to Daryn,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.243
see if this is, indeed, what he saw.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.641
- But?
- But,

13:21.800 --> 13:24.610
his mom told me Daryn never made it home
from work last night.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.770
No screwups, right?

13:30.760 --> 13:31.761
Excuse me, sir.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.846
Hi. Agents Stark and Martell, FBI.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.401
We're looking for Daryn Boston.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.085
Uh, Daryn?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.528
- Is he in trouble?
- No, no, no, not at all.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.286
We spoke with him yesterday.
Just wanna ask a few follow-up questions.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.641
I don't suppose he's around?

13:45.880 --> 13:48.451
No, Daryn didn't show up for work today.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.409
So, when was the last time you saw him?

13:53.760 --> 13:54.921
Uh, last night.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.606
Closed up.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.171
Talked about our big day today.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.606
What big day?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.049
You see that walking clipboard over there?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.683
- SAM: <i>Yeah.
- That's a health inspector.</i>

14:05.360 --> 14:06.407
He's trying to shut us down.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.927
How come? This place is spotless.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.606
It cleans up pretty nice,

14:10.800 --> 14:14.600
but our equipment,
it's a little out of date.

14:14.840 --> 14:15.921
Can't you upgrade?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.441
We would if we could.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.285
Business isn't exactly booming.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.761
We had to shut down half the plant
three months back.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.528
Meanwhile, our owner
would rather play sheriff

14:24.800 --> 14:26.643
- than actually take care of business...
- Wait a second.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.323
You're telling me
that Sheriff Bishop owns this place?

14:29.560 --> 14:30.561
Yeah.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.649
Barrett Bishop, Jr.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.407
Heir to the Bishop meat empire.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.920
His family,
they've owned this plant for... Forever.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.689
Barry's inside.
He's hoping to sweet-talk the inspector.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.770
If you ask me,
it's too little, way too late.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.081
INSPECTOR: <i>Mr. Garfinkle.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:50.810
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.891
So, we roll into town, look into a case,

14:55.160 --> 14:57.891
- talk to the local badge...
- And then our one witness goes missing.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.089
Last place he was seen,
owned by the Sheriff.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.561
Sound like a coincidence?

15:03.840 --> 15:04.841
Ooh.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.449
You hungry? I'm hungry.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.006
SAM: Excuse me, Sheriff.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.801
Agents. What are you guys doing here?

15:13.040 --> 15:15.725
Well, we could ask you
the same thing, except... Oh, right.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.610
You run the joint.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.282
Well, my name's on the paperwork.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.130
Pete handles the day-to-day.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.049
Are you still trying to
chase down Jarrod Hayes?

15:25.360 --> 15:28.523
- Yeah, and, uh, now, Daryn Boston.
- Yeah.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.846
Seems to have gone missing, too.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.364
- Geez. First I've heard of it.
- Yeah.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.681
So tell us,
what have you heard about Black Bill?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.405
- I'm sorry.
- SAM: <i>Black Bill.</i>

15:38.680 --> 15:41.684
Daryn told us
he saw Black Bill attack Jarrod Hayes.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.087
He didn't wanna tell you
'cause he didn't think you'd believe him.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.969
Well... You know.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.567
He's right.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.641
Look, round here, parents tell their kids
not to go into the woods

15:52.080 --> 15:54.242
or Black Bill will get 'em.
He's the bogeyman.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.047
Everyone knows
that the bogeyman ain't real.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.647
Sure about that?

15:58.880 --> 16:00.564
Seems like a lot of people
go missing in this town.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.802
Yeah, one a year, every year up until '97.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.008
Yeah. Okay.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.886
I mean, people come to town,
they work in the plant for a while,

16:08.040 --> 16:12.204
then they get bored and restless,
and they, you know, move on.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.806
And Daryn?

16:14.760 --> 16:17.923
Maybe Daryn thinks he saw Black Bill,
but let's be honest.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.441
Kid was drunk, high, or both.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.770
And I'll bet you dollars to donuts,
Daryn's just holed up, sleeping one off.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.604
Hell, he's probably waking up right now,
safe and sound.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.561
Hey!

16:54.760 --> 16:56.683
<i>Help, please!</i>

16:57.280 --> 16:58.281
<i>Help!</i>

17:01.440 --> 17:02.601
<i>Help me!</i>

17:05.680 --> 17:07.522
Well, Sheriff's
not acting suspicious at all.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.727
Right.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.205
Yeah, but how is
he connected to goat dude?

17:10.359 --> 17:12.010
Now that's a good question.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.401
Help!

18:00.720 --> 18:02.370
Help! Help!

18:02.680 --> 18:04.603
Please! Help me!

18:04.960 --> 18:06.166
Help! Help!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.761
Help! Help!

18:18.400 --> 18:19.731
Seriously? Dean?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.362
After what we just saw, how can you eat?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.205
Grow up, Sam, okay?

18:24.600 --> 18:27.001
Burger is beef, bacon's pig,
Soylent Green is people.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.403
- But this, this...
- This is heaven.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.281
Right.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.086
Um, so, uh, what's the word?
You find anything?

18:36.400 --> 18:37.401
Mmm. Yeah, kind of.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.730
So I cross-checked all the names
of the people who went missing

18:43.000 --> 18:44.809
with the employee roster
at Billhook Meats.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.520
And?
Any more of the vics work at the plant?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.085
- Try all of 'em.
- All of 'em?

18:50.680 --> 18:51.681
Seriously?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.803
So I guess that means, safe to say that,

18:54.560 --> 18:56.642
uh, Black Bill is
definitely connected to the plant?

18:56.840 --> 18:57.841
Yeah.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.567
Or the family that runs it. Or both.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.008
Well, maybe they just run
an evil petting zoo on the side.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.760
So, I, uh, spent some time
at the Hall of Records.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.967
The Bishops founded Tomahawk. Everything.
This was a company town.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.567
Er, if you lived here,
you worked at the plant.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.565
The Bishops owned all the houses,
all the businesses.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.127
Or they did until a few years ago.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.446
Looks like the Sheriff has been
selling off all of their family property.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.051
- Mmm.
- Everything, really,

19:27.240 --> 19:30.323
except for the plant
and the family estate.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.726
DEAN: Wow.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.008
So, who lives at the Addams Family house?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.921
- It's Mick.
- DEAN: <i>Okay.</i>

19:39.160 --> 19:40.161
Tell him we're cool.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.449
So, creepy house?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.001
Creepy house.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.569
It's clear. Onward.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.969
<i>Now, remember your orders.</i>

19:55.160 --> 19:56.241
By the time we leave,

19:56.400 --> 20:00.485
Dr. Hess wants to know everything
about our friends the Winchesters.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.450
<i>Their allies. Their habits.</i>

20:02.840 --> 20:05.650
<i>How does Sam get his hair so shiny?</i>

20:05.920 --> 20:08.651
How many ratty flannels does Dean own?

20:08.880 --> 20:12.282
So, work quick, work quiet,
and leave no trace.

20:12.880 --> 20:18.330
Oh, and apparently, Mick let Sam and Dean
get their hands on the bloody Colt.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.601
Find it, huh?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.007
Looks empty.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.846
DEAN: <i>Well, why don't we check inside?
Maybe we'll get lucky.</i>

21:23.680 --> 21:26.286
Dean. I'd say we just got lucky.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.001
DEAN: Wow.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.041
DEAN: Hello?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.001
Goat dude?

22:17.440 --> 22:18.930
Why is it always the rich ones?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.810
I mean, what, are they, like,
"Croquet's all right,"

22:22.960 --> 22:25.281
"but you know what'd be great? Murder."

22:58.480 --> 22:59.481
Hiya, Sheriff.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.641
Talk.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.649
- Listen, it's not what it looks like.
- Really?

23:16.040 --> 23:18.088
'Cause it looks like
a straight-up murder room to me.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.968
Sheriff, what's going on?

23:23.640 --> 23:24.641
Oh, youse...

23:25.840 --> 23:27.080
Youse won't believe me.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.161
Try us.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.685
We have a pretty open mind.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.690
My family, we've...

23:39.320 --> 23:40.606
Got a secret.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.650
All the best ones do.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.971
Is this about Black Bill?

23:46.440 --> 23:49.523
No. I mean, yeah, but he's not real.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.131
Black Bill, he's...

23:54.720 --> 23:55.767
Us.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.126
Come again?

24:01.720 --> 24:05.247
Growing up, my father'd
tell me stories about a monster.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.290
Lived under our house
and made our family rich.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.484
All we had to do was... Was feed it.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.361
Feed it what?

24:15.960 --> 24:16.961
Blood.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.881
Human blood.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.481
My dad, his dad, and all the way back,

24:24.720 --> 24:28.964
they'd go out and grab some poor
son of a bitch, bring 'em here and...

24:35.760 --> 24:37.762
When they did it, they wore a mask.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.567
<i>Black Bill.</i>

24:40.640 --> 24:41.880
<i>We made him up.</i>

24:42.160 --> 24:43.764
So, goat dude is just a dude?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.561
Then who's the monster?

24:47.680 --> 24:48.727
Moloch.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.526
The god of sacrifice.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.965
What, I'm sorry.
You have a god living in your basement?

24:55.360 --> 24:59.888
Yeah, one of my people way back,
they bound Moloch, locked him away.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.681
<i>Starved him.</i>

25:03.240 --> 25:04.730
<i>My family, that's what we did.</i>

25:05.240 --> 25:09.086
<i>We let the god get so hungry
that he'd do anything for blood.</i>

25:13.400 --> 25:15.562
<i>Moloch used his power to make us rich.</i>

25:19.640 --> 25:23.122
<i>After my father died in '97,
I put a stop to all of that.</i>

25:23.520 --> 25:24.521
<i>Look, I couldn't...</i>

25:25.960 --> 25:27.769
I never killed anybody.
I just wanted to help people.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.442
To make up for all the bad we've done.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.601
I wanted...

25:33.320 --> 25:34.446
To leave a legacy.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.809
Well, aren't you just a peach?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.286
So, what happened to Moloch?

25:41.400 --> 25:42.686
I kept him locked up.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.520
Hoped he'd starve to death.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.886
Locked up where?

26:34.960 --> 26:35.961
It's empty-

26:36.320 --> 26:37.321
What?

26:38.200 --> 26:40.282
- It's empty.
- No, no. No, no, no.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.806
Stay here. Keep an eye on him.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.081
What?

26:49.440 --> 26:50.851
Dean, there could be a god up there.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.201
I'm cool.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.601
Dean?

28:17.280 --> 28:18.281
Hey!

28:21.920 --> 28:22.967
<i>Hey! Open up!</i>

28:24.840 --> 28:25.887
<i>Hey!</i>

28:40.400 --> 28:41.481
Here. Here.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.241
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to track Dean's cell phone.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.406
All right, got it. Let's go.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.130
Just as I thought.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.170
Can't see a damn thing.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.840
Hiya, Pete.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.406
Nice digs.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.808
<i>I didn't expect to see you again, Agent.</i>

30:32.640 --> 30:34.608
I went to the house
looking for my brother.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.881
Brother?

30:36.200 --> 30:39.807
Barry. Different moms, same daddy.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.844
Old man Bishop, he, uh...

30:46.440 --> 30:48.124
He had an eye for the ladies.

30:48.640 --> 30:52.122
Hey, everyone in town knew about it,
but didn't make a difference.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.882
Barry grew up in the big house.
I grew up in a double-wide.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.767
- Does that sound fair to you?
- Honestly?

31:00.480 --> 31:02.687
Sounds like a bad episode of Dynasty.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.005
You got a lot of jokes.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.129
Yeah, right now, that's about all I got.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.721
Right.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.051
You know what I got?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.961
A god.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.487
Moloch.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.841
Bingo!

31:26.680 --> 31:30.765
With Barry giving away the family fortune
like that, I had to get creative.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.886
<i>I went to the old house, trying to
get my hands on anything I could sell.</i>

31:37.720 --> 31:39.290
<i>But I found something else.</i>

31:47.000 --> 31:48.001
Moloch.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.729
<i>He told me he'd make me rich.
He told me he'd solve all my problems.</i>

31:55.720 --> 31:57.609
<i>All I had to do was feed him.</i>

31:58.680 --> 32:01.081
And, hell, I'm a Bishop.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.001
That's what we do, right? Hunting people.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.171
Killing them! The family business!

32:08.160 --> 32:10.128
Moloch's been starved for 20 years.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.768
It's gonna take a few meals
for him to get his mojo going, but then,

32:14.680 --> 32:16.364
we are back, baby.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.047
Yeah.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.084
I'm saving this town.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.364
Well, I'll tell that to Jarrod and Daryn.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.201
Jarrod was a screwup!

32:25.400 --> 32:26.686
He got what he deserved!

32:27.040 --> 32:31.090
And Daryn? Well, sorry, bud,
but once he talked, he had to go.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.011
Loose ends, you know? Loose ends!

32:34.520 --> 32:35.646
Come on!

32:35.920 --> 32:40.130
My jackass half-brother was supposed to be
the next meal, but you'll do.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.600
Hey. Pete, let's just talk about this.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.042
Listen. Let's...

32:49.440 --> 32:50.930
It'll be over soon.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.566
Thanks for helping out!

32:53.000 --> 32:54.126
But...

32:59.480 --> 33:01.084
The sweep's complete, sir.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.924
We've photographed
and cataloged every inch.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.804
- And the Colt?
- I'm afraid not.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.122
- The Winchesters must have it.
- Bugger.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.725
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.564
Just one last thing.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.481
Now then, I could use a pint.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.161
Pete!

34:20.560 --> 34:21.971
Pete!

34:23.920 --> 34:25.045
Dean?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.401
Dean?

35:35.240 --> 35:36.241
Dean?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.130
Come on, you son of a bitch.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.448
Pete! You have to stop.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.400
- Don't act like you care.
- I gave you the plant.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.406
Oh! Because you knew it was failing.
What a bunch of crap.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.241
That's what I get.
I get that my whole life! The crap!

36:32.680 --> 36:33.681
Not anymore.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.610
<i>I'm saving this town.</i>

36:35.920 --> 36:36.921
I'm the hero.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.007
And you're dead.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.081
Colt.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.721
Dusts anything.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.446
Hey.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.446
How you feeling?

37:40.560 --> 37:45.122
Like I just went 12 rounds with a god.
So, you know, normal.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.045
- Yeah.
- You should go.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.044
- No, Sheriff, we can help clean up.
- No.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.406
This, I'll take care of it. It's on me.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.681
This...

38:03.040 --> 38:04.326
This is my legacy.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.881
- Hey.
- Yep.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.247
Next time you hear me say
that our family is messed up,

38:16.400 --> 38:19.529
remind me that
we could be psycho goat people.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.370
Yeah, that's true enough.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.363
You know, I was
thinking about what Bishop said.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.287
About...

38:30.880 --> 38:32.405
What do you think our legacy is gonna be?

38:35.160 --> 38:37.561
When we're gone,
I mean, after all the stuff we've done,

38:37.840 --> 38:40.810
you think folks will remember us,
you know, like, 100 years from now?

38:43.360 --> 38:44.407
No.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.281
Oh, that's nice.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.882
Well, I mean, guys like us,
we're not exactly the type of people

38:50.040 --> 38:51.849
they write about in history books,
you know?

38:52.040 --> 38:53.087
Mmm.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.211
But the people we saved...

38:57.600 --> 38:58.681
They're our legacy.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.443
And they'll remember us,
and then, I guess,

39:03.280 --> 39:05.009
we'll eventually fade away, too.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.606
That's fine.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.131
Because we left the world
better than we found it. You know?

39:19.640 --> 39:21.324
I wonder
what's gonna happen to this place.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.127
After we're gone,
you think some hunter will move in,

39:26.280 --> 39:27.611
keep fighting the fight?

39:29.440 --> 39:30.771
Yeah, I hope so.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.441
Yeah.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.961
Me, too.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.926
What are you doing?

39:48.280 --> 39:50.647
I'm leaving our mark.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.681
Here.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.806
SAM: <i>Hmm.</i>

40:40.640 --> 40:43.166
Guess we gotta call Mick,
debrief or whatever.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.361
Right.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.965
MR. KETCH: <i>Hello, Winchester.</i>

40:52.240 --> 40:54.163
Ketch? Where's Mick?

40:54.360 --> 40:57.011
Oh, he didn't tell you?
He flew back to London last night.

40:57.360 --> 41:00.648
<i>After all the, uh, unpleasantness
with Dagon and Renny.</i>

41:00.880 --> 41:03.201
Well, Mick has a lot to answer for.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.011
So, for the time being,
you'll report to me.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.131
- Seriously?
<i>- I don't like it any more than you do.</i>

41:10.400 --> 41:12.323
I'd much rather be with your mother.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.727
<i>Hunting.</i>

41:14.880 --> 41:16.803
For chupacabra in Texas.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.689
<i>But for now, I'm what you've got.</i>

41:20.360 --> 41:21.885
So, Wisconsin?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.685
We fought a god and won.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.841
<i>Well done.</i>

41:25.840 --> 41:27.126
We'll be in touch.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.366
So, now we're reporting
to low-rent Christian Bale?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.041
<i>Seriously?</i>

41:38.240 --> 41:39.810
<i>I don't like that guy. He creeps me out.</i>

41:41.040 --> 41:42.041
SAM: <i>Yeah.</i>

41:43.680 --> 41:50.245
<i>And he rides the oldest, worst,
most unreliable bike.</i>
