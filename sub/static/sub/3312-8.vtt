WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:09.810
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.213
WOW, JACKIE, THIS MIGHT BE THE
HARDEST SHOPPING DECISION

00:12.246 --> 00:14.048
YOU'LL EVER HAVE TO MAKE.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.583
YEAH, NO RETURN POLICY ON THIS.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.586
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS BUYING?
BOOTS? PURSES?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.821
SPERM FOR JACKIE'S BABY.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.423
THAT IS NOT A PURSE.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.826
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY HOW I PICTURED
MYSELF DOING THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.462
I THINK IT'S GREAT. YEAH, I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TIME WOMEN YOUR AGE

00:28.496 --> 00:30.598
STOPPED WAITING AND
HOPING AND PRAYING

00:30.631 --> 00:33.467
FOR THE RIGHT MAN.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.603
EXACTLY HOW OLD DO
YOU THINK WE ARE?

00:37.605 --> 00:40.074
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT
NARROWED DOWN TO TWO...

00:40.108 --> 00:43.244
V-117 AND L-245.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.778
CAN WE GIVE THEM NAMES, PLEASE?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.381
CALLING THEM BY NUMBER SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
ORDERING FROM A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.150
HEY, NO NEED TO ORDER CHINESE

00:49.183 --> 00:51.552
WHEN YOU GOT... ITALIAN.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.521
HELLO, JACKIE.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.524
YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND. I'M GONNA
POP A LITTLE SOMETHING IN THE OVEN.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.093
SO ARE YOU.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.628
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,

01:00.661 --> 01:04.498
L-245 IS "BLOND HAIR, NORDIC
HERITAGE, ENGLISH TEACHER,

01:04.532 --> 01:06.267
PLAYS LEAD GUITAR
IN LOCAL BAND."

01:06.300 --> 01:09.237
LARS... VAN HALEN.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.239
WHAT?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.640
- I'M JUST GIVING HIM A NAME.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.209
IN HIS PERSONAL
STATEMENT, LARS SAYS,

01:15.243 --> 01:18.512
"LIFE IS A BLANK PAGE. I WRITE
A POEM ON IT EVERY DAY."

01:18.546 --> 01:22.350
YOU DON'T FIND D.N.A. LIKE
THAT SITTING ON A BAR STOOL.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.618
OKAY, AND BACHELOR ♪2...

01:24.652 --> 01:26.654
"EARLY 30s, ITALIAN AMERICAN."

01:26.687 --> 01:30.258
VINCENZO BOYARDEE.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.627
I'M GREAT AT THIS. I SHOULD HAVE
MY OWN SPERM NAMING BUSINESS.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.529
- GO ON.
- "IVY LEAGUE,

01:35.563 --> 01:37.531
FINANCIAL EXECUTIVE,
SPEAKS JAPANESE."

01:37.565 --> 01:39.867
"EXTREMELY FIT, GREAT DANCER."

01:39.900 --> 01:42.503
JEEZ, VINCENZO COULD
PASS FOR JOE.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.538
"SENSITIVE, GOOD LISTENER"...

01:44.572 --> 01:46.607
NOPE, DEFINITELY NOT JOE.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.509
WELL, VINCENZO'S
PRACTICALLY A CHEF.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.145
APPARENTLY, HIS SPICY
PARMESAN DIAVOLO

01:51.179 --> 01:53.547
WILL BLOW YOU AWAY.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.683
WOW, ALL THIS MAN-SHOPPING'S
MAKING ME REALLY HUNGRY.

01:55.716 --> 01:59.187
HEY, LONGO, WHAT'S ON THE MENU?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.589
A LITTLE SOMETHING I LIKE TO
CALL SPICY PARMESAN DIAVOLO.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.593
TELL ME THAT'S A
POPULAR ITALIAN DISH.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.661
NOPE, IT'S ALL MINE,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.730
AND IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY.

SWIMMERS GETS THE GOLD MEDAL.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.634
BYE.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.604
SO THAT DINNER SURE SMELLS GOOD.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.973
WOW, YOU REALLY ENJOY
COOKING, DON'T YOU?

02:53.006 --> 02:56.677
ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU ENJOY
STAYING FIT, SPEAKING JAPANESE,

02:56.710 --> 02:58.679
BEING ITALIAN.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.516
YOU LIKE WATCHING ME, DON'T YOU?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.752
YEAH, I WAS JUST THINKING,
YOU KNOW, RANDOM THOUGHT.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.488
PEOPLE DO SOME STRANGE
THINGS FOR MONEY, RIGHT?

03:07.521 --> 03:10.558
LIKE, ONCE I WAS PAID 50
BUCKS TO DANCE IN A CAGE.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.762
IT WAS A FUNDRAISER FOR THE ZOO.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.364
SO HOW ABOUT YOU?

03:16.397 --> 03:19.233
WHAT'S THE MOST DEGRADING
THING YOU EVER DID FOR MONEY?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.469
BY FAR, THIS.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.773
NO, SERIOUSLY. WHAT'S THE WACKIEST
THING YOU EVER DID FOR CASH?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.007
LIKE, YOU EVER SELL
ANYTHING FROM YOUR BODY?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.343
BLOOD? HAIR?

03:29.377 --> 03:31.579
MALE REPRODUCTIVE STUFF?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.382
BURKE, I'M TRYING
TO COOK HERE, OKAY?

03:34.415 --> 03:36.984
FUNNY STORY. YOU KNOW
JACKIE WANTS TO HAVE A BABY

03:37.017 --> 03:40.754
AND SHE'S CONSIDERING A DONOR
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE ITALIAN,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.624
IVY LEAGUE, EXTREMELY FIT...

03:43.657 --> 03:44.758
THAT COULD BE A LOT OF GUYS.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.361
...AND HE MAKES A SPICY
PARMESAN DIAVOLO

03:47.395 --> 03:49.830
THAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.271
- YOU BLINKED!
- OH BOY.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.273
I KNEW IT! YOU'RE VINCENZO!

03:59.307 --> 04:00.808
WHAT? WHAT? WHO?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.711
THAT'S WHAT WE NAMED
THE CAN OF, YOU KNOW,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.846
YOU.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.652
COME ON, SPILL IT, VINCENZO.
THEN AGAIN, YOU ALREADY HAVE.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.421
WELL, ALL RIGHT, FINE.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.723
FINE, IT WAS AFTER THE SCANDAL,
AND I NEEDED SOME MONEY, OKAY?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.426
SO THE SPERM BANK WEBSITE
WAS VERY PERSUASIVE.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.761
IT SAID, "BE YOUR OWN BOSS,
MAKE YOUR OWN HOURS."

04:22.830 --> 04:24.798
I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST
KIND OF SUCKED ME IN.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.468
OH, WILL YOU GROW UP?

04:27.501 --> 04:28.769
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.439
WHAT WAS I THINKING? I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MAKING THE RENT, OKAY?

04:31.472 --> 04:34.875
OH, AND JESSICA ALBA.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.346
SO I JUST WOULD STOP
BY THE CRYO PLACE

04:38.379 --> 04:39.613
WHENEVER I NEEDED
SOME QUICK CASH.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.850
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MIGHT BE
HAVING A KID WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.453
WHAT? NO NO, THAT CANNOT
HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.821
YOU GOTTA TALK JACKIE OUT
OF USING ME... IT...

04:47.855 --> 04:50.858
LIQUID LONGO.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.860
ABSOLUTELY, I'M GONNA DO THAT.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.729
THE LAST THING THIS TROUBLED
WORLD NEEDS IS ANY MORE OF YOU.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.466
LOOK, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT
TELL HER IT'S ME, ALL RIGHT?

04:58.499 --> 05:02.403
BECAUSE HONESTLY, BURKE, THIS IS THE
ONE THING IN MY LIFE I'M NOT PROUD OF.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.806
BUT YOU'RE OKAY BEING THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF A COMPANY THAT LOST A BILLION DOLLARS?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.776
A BILLION DOLLARS, BURKE.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.345
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.886
AND THE GARAGE SALE WAS A TOTAL
WASHOUT UNTIL WE FOUND...

05:18.919 --> 05:21.889
"THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE
WARDROBE" BY C.S. LEWIS.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.627
WAIT, YOU PAID 50 BUCKS
FOR A USED BOOK?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.896
WHAT DOES IT DO, SHOOT LASERS?

05:28.929 --> 05:32.900
- IT'S A FIRST EDITION.
- I BET I COULD FIND IT FOR LESS.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.470
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE PAID FOR
IT BECAUSE IT'S OUR FAVORITE BOOK.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.873
HE SAW ME READING IT ONE DAY AND HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW THAT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK."

05:39.907 --> 05:43.110
YES, I DID. I SAID
IT RIGHT TO HER.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.679
AND NOW IT'S THE FIRST THING
WE EVER BOUGHT TOGETHER.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.949
- YES, IT IS, BABY-BOO.
- YOU ARE RIGHT, BOO-BABY.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.386
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.589
THIS AUCTION SITE SAYS THAT
YOUR BOOK IS WORTH $1,500.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.591
NO WAY, THAT'S GREAT.
WE'RE RICH!

05:57.625 --> 05:59.126
YEAH, IN THEORY.

05:59.159 --> 06:02.763
AND IN CASH. HERE'S ONE
THAT JUST WENT FOR $2,000.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.832
NOW WAY, WOW! WE COULD
BUY MATCHING VESPAS

06:04.865 --> 06:07.167
AND HAVE ENOUGH LEFT
OVER FOR AN XBOX.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.869
ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU'D SELL IT?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.505
SURE, YEAH, THAT'S
A LOT OF MONEY.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.941
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?
THIS IS C.S. LEWIS.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.445
LENNOX, COME ON, IF C.S.
LEWIS WERE HERE RIGHT NOW,

06:17.478 --> 06:20.414
SHE'D SAY "SELL IT."

06:20.448 --> 06:21.815
"SHE"?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.917
HERE WE GO.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.655
C.S. LEWIS IS A MAN. DID
YOU EVEN READ THE BOOK?

06:27.688 --> 06:31.659
SURE, DUH. YEAH, IT'S
OUR FAVORITE BOOK.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.828
OH, REALLY? WELL, THEN
TELL ME ABOUT NARNIA.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.964
SHE'S THE LITTLE GIRL.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.832
THE COWARDLY LION.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.502
- OH, MY GOD!
- SIMBA'S DAD?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.671
BAD ROAD, MAN.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.839
YOU LIED TO ME. YOU
NEVER READ IT.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.742
I TRIED, BUT THERE WERE NO GUNS,
AND I KEPT FALLING ASLEEP.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.978
AND THEN I RENTED THE MOVIE, BUT
THEY PUT THE WRONG DISC IN,

06:51.011 --> 06:54.848
SO I WATCHED "ANCHORMAN."
NOW THAT IS A GREAT STORY.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.986
( emphatically )
JUST STOP TALKING.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.522
YOU SAID YOU LOVED LITERATURE.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.457
YEAH, I WAS TRYING TO
SHARE YOUR INTERESTS.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.758
LOOK, HOW ABOUT WE
JUST SELL THE BOOK,

07:04.792 --> 07:07.561
SPLIT THE MONEY AND THEN GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.796
THINGS CANNOT GO BACK TO
THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE,

07:08.829 --> 07:12.232
BECAUSE YOUR HATRED OF BOOKS
HAS CHANGED THINGS FOREVER.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.636
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING SUCH
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS. CALM DOWN.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.005
YOU WANT ME TO "CALM DOWN"?
OH, I'LL CALM DOWN.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.608
- SHE'S NOT GONNA CALM DOWN.
- ( door opens )

07:25.278 --> 07:28.616
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.951
BOOKSELLING BASTARD.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.926
- OKAY, I WANT YOU TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW IT'S LARS...
- OH!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.894
...WHO GETS DISCARDED.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.597
- WHAT?
- YEP, VINCENZO GETS THE GOLD.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.999
WAIT, NO NO NO. LOOK, YOU HAVEN'T
GIVEN LARS A FAIR SHAKE.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.736
HE'S A MIDDLE SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.738
HOW HOT IS THAT?

07:50.771 --> 07:54.575
SORRY, I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
JUST REALLY FEELING VINCENZO.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.911
OKAY OKAY, YOU WANT AN ITALIAN,
THERE'S FOUR OF 'EM IN HERE.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.048
YOU COULD GET 'EM ALL,
MAKE YOUR OWN HOUSE BLEND.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.917
NO, I'M A PURIST. I'M
STICKING WITH VINCENZO.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.054
I LIKE THE WHOLE PACKAGE.
I LIKE WHO HE IS.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.923
NO NO, YOU DON'T. YOU
DEFINITELY DON'T,

08:09.957 --> 08:12.025
'CAUSE... 'CAUSE...

08:12.059 --> 08:14.528
VINCENZO IS JOE!

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
- WHICH JOE?
- MY JOE. NANNY JOE.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.766
YOU KNOW, NOT-A-GOOD-CHOICE-
FOR-A-FATHER JOE.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.802
JOE. WOW.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.871
I KNOW, RIGHT? CLOSE CALL.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.107
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK
ME, BUT YOU CAN.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.610
NO, REALLY, YOU CAN.

08:29.643 --> 08:34.047
MEL, THE REASON I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME
PICKING ONE OF THESE ANONYMOUS DONORS

08:34.081 --> 08:36.049
IS 'CAUSE OF ALL THE UNKNOWNS,

08:36.083 --> 08:38.886
BUT NOW I KNOW IT'S JOE.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.622
OH, YOU'VE PUT A
FACE ON THAT SPERM.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.925
BUT IT'S JOE'S FACE,
JOE'S SMUG LITTLE FACE.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.860
YES, THANK YOU, MEL.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.062
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE REALLY
EASED MY MIND ABOUT THIS.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.732
HEY, JOE IT IS.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.104
OH JOY. MY NANNY IS SPAWNING.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.579
- HEY.
- HEY. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE BACK FROM JACKIE.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.347
- HOW DID EVERYTHING GO?
- ( sighs )

09:07.380 --> 09:09.983
SOMETIMES THERE'S NO
TALKING TO WOMEN.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.085
BURKE, YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO STOP HER.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.089
YEAH, I TRIED, BUT HER UTERUS
IS LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.692
OKAY, THAT'S IT. WE HAVE TO
PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS HERE.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.696
YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO GO NUCLEAR.
YOU TELL JACKIE THAT I AM VINCENZO.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.032
I DID, BUT THAT DOOMSDAY
DEVICE DIDN'T DETONATE.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.935
JACKIE IS DETERMINED
TO HAVE A BABY-YOU

09:27.968 --> 09:31.071
IN A SKINTIGHT ONESIE,
BENCH-PRESSING HIS RATTLE.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.006
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BABY
WITH JACKIE, ALL RIGHT?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.643
IF I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY, I DON'T
WANNA KNOW WHO THE MOTHER IS.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.378
OH, AND THEY SAY
ROMANCE IS DEAD.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.080
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, ALL RIGHT?

09:40.113 --> 09:42.149
'CAUSE IF JACKIE HAS MY
BABY, IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN

09:42.182 --> 09:44.051
SHE'S GONNA BRING
THE BABY OVER HERE,

09:44.084 --> 09:47.921
AND OF COURSE IT'S GONNA BE
JUST SO FRIGGIN' ADORABLE.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.391
OKAY, NEW PLAN... YOU GO
DOWN TO THE CRYO BANK

09:51.424 --> 09:55.162
AND BUY BACK ALL YOUR... CRYO.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.631
BUY BACK MY OWN STUFF?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.067
HOW'S THAT GONNA LOOK, HUH?

10:00.100 --> 10:03.671
TELL THEM IT'S A RECALL. YOU JUST
DISCOVERED YOU HAVE A GENETIC DEFECT.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.173
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE BORN
WITH YOUR HEAD UP YOUR ASS.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.977
DID YOU KNOW MEN ARE HORRIBLE?

10:10.010 --> 10:13.080
I INVENTED "MEN ARE
HORRIBLE." WHAT CLUED YOU IN?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.783
HASKELL PRETENDED TO LIKE
SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.086
HONEY, THAT'S GREAT!
THAT'S THE GOAL.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.056
ONLY SOMEONE WHO REALLY LIKED YOU WOULD
GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF FAKING THAT.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.092
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE
WANTS TO SELL OUR BOOK,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.928
BECAUSE MONEY MEANS
MORE TO HIM THAN I DO.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.164
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU JUST
GOTTA GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO PROVE IT.

10:31.198 --> 10:35.068
BUT WOULDN'T THAT BE MANIPULATIVE,
IN AN EVIL GIRL SORT OF WAY?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
OH, WELL, I WOULD NEVER
SUGGEST YOU DO THAT.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.006
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WRONG.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.809
- VERY WRONG.
- ( cell phone whistles )

10:41.842 --> 10:44.011
TWEET FROM JACKIE.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.413
"CONGRATULATE ME, EVERYBODY.
TODAY IS BABY-MAKING DAY

10:46.446 --> 10:48.949
AND I'M GOING SHOPPING FOR
THE SECRET INGREDIENT."

10:48.982 --> 10:50.718
OH MY GOD!

10:55.889 --> 10:58.125
JACKIE, STOP. AM I TOO LATE?

10:58.158 --> 11:02.062
DID YOU ALREADY BUY THE... AWW,
LOOK AT THE BABY PICTURES.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.064
YOU'RE SO...

11:04.097 --> 11:07.100
SORRY, BIG BLAST OF HORMONES.
OKAY, I'M FOCUSED.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.202
MEL, MY MIND'S MADE UP.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.706
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT, BUT...
AWW, THERE'S TWINS!

11:12.740 --> 11:15.242
AREN'T YOU THE
CUTEST LITTLE THING?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.878
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD. WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT JOE.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.881
JOE. YOU KNOW, YOUR BABY'S
FIRST WORDS WILL BE,

11:20.914 --> 11:24.718
"YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BREAST MILK NEEDS?
A LITTLE BASIL."

11:24.752 --> 11:27.187
- I'VE ALREADY PUT IN MY ORDER.
- JACQUELINE MILLER?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.757
YES, I AM JACQUELINE MILLER,
AND I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.759
NO GENETIC MATERIAL
FOR ME TODAY.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.961
EVERYONE ELSE CAN FILL 'ER UP.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.263
MEL. I'M JACQUELINE MILLER.

11:36.296 --> 11:40.200
I'M SORRY, BUT THE DONOR YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.737
REALLY?! I MEAN, REALLY?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.238
BUT I WANTED HIM.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.007
SO DOES A COUPLE THAT
WANTS A LARGE FAMILY.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.276
THEY BOUGHT OUT OUR
ENTIRE SUPPLY LAST WEEK.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.012
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
CHOOSE ANOTHER DONOR?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.280
NO.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.150
NO, I'VE HAD MY HEART
SET ON VINCENZO.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.887
HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.156
SOME DAY YOUR PRINCE WILL COME...
ALONG.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.158
ALONG.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.281
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. CHEERS!

12:28.315 --> 12:32.152
YAY! YES! THANK YOU, BURKE.
I OWE YOU.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.553
IT WASN'T JUST ME.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.189
SOME OTHER COUPLE BEAT
JACKIE TO YOUR ENTIRE STOCK.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.358
SO I WAS...

12:40.227 --> 12:42.329
SOLD OUT? ( clears throat )

12:43.330 --> 12:46.333
YES, YOU WERE ON BACK-ORDER.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.936
THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.872
- COOL?
- YEAH, I MEAN, I MAY NEVER MEET THE RIGHT WOMAN,

12:51.905 --> 12:55.242
SO THIS MAY BE THE ONLY WAY
FOR ME TO PASS ON TO MANKIND

12:55.275 --> 12:58.078
THE GIFT OF ME.

12:58.111 --> 13:02.082
MANKIND MIGHT PREFER TO EXCHANGE
YOU FOR A NICE SWEATER.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.085
YEAH? THAT COUPLE KNEW A GOOD
FATHER WHEN THEY SAW ONE.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.354
YOU'RE NOT A FATHER.
YOU'RE GENETIC MATERIAL.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.090
I DON'T SEE A BIG RUN ON TO THE
BANKS TO GET TO YOUR EGGS.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.293
THAT'S BECAUSE I KEEP MY REPRODUCTIVE STUFF
RIGHT HERE WHERE NOBODY CAN GET AT IT.

13:13.326 --> 13:17.030
SOME OF US HAVE RESPECT
FOR OUR BODIES.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.902
OH MY GOD, THAT
IS LOVE IN A CAN.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.972
WHAT'S JACKIE GONNA DO NOW?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.274
YOU KNOW, SHE'LL MOVE ON.
SHE'LL REGROUP.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.142
SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.312
LET'S PLAY CHARADES. WHO AM I?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.991
( doorbell rings )

13:44.024 --> 13:45.192
YEAH.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.295
OH HEY, JACKIE. MEL'S NOT HERE.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.065
I'M NOT ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR MEL.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.967
OH?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.274
AREN'T YOU GONNA ASK ME IN?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.145
PLEASE COME IN.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.216
I'M SURE MEL TOLD YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED
I WAS THAT YOUR STOCK WAS SOLD OUT.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.318
YEAH, THAT'S THE FREE
MARKET FOR YOU...

14:11.351 --> 14:15.022
YOU KNOW, SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.957
DEMAND MORE SUPPLY,

14:16.990 --> 14:19.392
MAYBE SEE WHEN THE NEXT
SHIPMENT IS EXPECTED.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.161
YEAH, I DON'T THINK I'M
GONNA BE GOING DOWN

14:21.194 --> 14:24.097
TO THE CRYO BANK ANY TIME SOON.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.332
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST
CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN

14:25.365 --> 14:28.035
AND GO DIRECT TO
THE MANUFACTURER?

14:29.202 --> 14:32.172
HELLO, MANUFACTURER.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.241
ACTUALLY, JACKIE,

14:34.274 --> 14:38.078
THAT FACTORY'S BEEN SHUT DOWN.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.448
ACTUALLY, NO, IT STILL WORKS.
IT STILL WORKS VERY WELL,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.017
BUT IT'S BEING A LITTLE
MORE SELECTIVE NOW,

14:44.051 --> 14:47.054
YOU KNOW, STRICTLY
FOR PRIVATE EVENTS.

14:47.087 --> 14:50.223
SO I'M POSITIVE, THOUGH, THERE ARE
PLENTY OF OTHER GUYS OUT THERE

14:50.257 --> 14:51.458
THAT'D BE WILLING
TO HELP YOU OUT.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.461
I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER GUYS.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.964
I WANT YOU, JOE LONGO.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.168
THIRSTY?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.303
'CAUSE I SUDDENLY JUST
BECAME REALLY PARCHED.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.043
SO CAN I GET YOU WATER
OR SODA OR SOMETHING?

15:10.077 --> 15:13.113
HOW ABOUT A CUP OF JOE?

15:13.146 --> 15:16.283
THAT'S A LITTLE DOUBLE
THING THERE, HUH?

15:18.118 --> 15:21.721
COME ON, DON'T YOU WANT PART OF YOU
TO LIVE ON FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.224
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.294
I WANT PERFECTION AND YOU
PRACTICALLY HAVE IT.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.396
NO, JACKIE, PLEASE, I'M
FLATTERED THAT YOU THINK I'M...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.398
"PRACTICALLY"?

15:31.431 --> 15:35.302
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.304
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.439
LOOK, YOU NEED A LITTLE
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

15:39.472 --> 15:43.210
IS THERE A PLACE WE COULD GO
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.312
TO TALK.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.314
YOU WANNA TALK?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.282
REAL BAD.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.022
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED. I
KNOW HOW MAD YOU WERE.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.490
I WAS, BUT I NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.327
IN THE GARAGE, NEAR POWER TOOLS?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.329
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
STILL NOT MAD?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.331
NOT AT ALL. I'VE BEEN THINKING.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.133
IF YOU WANNA SELL THE
BOOK AND I WANNA KEEP IT,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.301
THEN THERE'S ONLY WAY
TO RESOLVE THIS...

16:08.335 --> 16:09.769
DIVIDE IT EVENLY.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.040
- THE MONEY?
- NO, THE BOOK.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.075
- ( saw whirring )
- CUT IT IN HALF.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.546
WAIT, NO NO! LENNOX, STOP.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.516
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE BOOK. MAYBE I'M NOT
INTO POETRY OR FICTION AS MUCH AS YOU ARE,

16:23.550 --> 16:26.286
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
ALL I WANT IS FOR
YOU TO BE HAPPY.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.423
ALL I WANT IS FOR
ME TO BE HAPPY.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.525
SEE? WE'RE BOTH INTERESTED
IN THE SAME THING.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.262
AW, YOU PASS WITH FLYING COLORS.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.064
WAIT. THIS WAS A TEST?

16:37.097 --> 16:39.399
NO, THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.304
BUT LUCKILY, HASKELL PASSED THE TEST...
NOT THAT IT WAS A TEST,

16:44.337 --> 16:47.240
BUT IT WAS A TEST. A BIG TEST.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.176
YOU TOOK A PRETTY BIG GAMBLE.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.212
IF HE HADN'T STOPPED YOU, YOU'D
HAVE DESTROYED YOUR PRECIOUS BOOK.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.547
YEAH, I CAME VERY CLOSE
TO DESTROYING THIS COPY

16:54.581 --> 16:57.284
OF "THE SISTERHOOD OF
THE TRAVELING PANTS,"

16:57.317 --> 16:59.819
IN ESPANOL.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.455
WOW, YOU'RE DIABOLICAL.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.325
SI. MUY DIABOLICA.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.795
LOOK WHAT SOMEONE ♪ BOUGHT ME.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.198
EXPENSIVE NEW SHOES.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.166
OOH, WHO GOT THEM FOR YOU?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.834
I DID.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.304
OH, SOMETIMES I THINK
I'M SPOILING ME.

17:17.337 --> 17:21.108
- IS THERE AN OCCASION?
- YES, I HAVE PRETTY FEET.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.077
AND SOMETHING VERY BAD
DID NOT HAPPEN TODAY.

17:24.111 --> 17:28.081
- WHAT?
- IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO TELL YOU.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.549
LET'S JUST SAY TRUST ME

17:29.582 --> 17:32.152
AND BE HAPPY FOR ALL OF US.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.422
- ( cell phone whistles )
- ANOTHER TWEET FROM JACKIE.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.357
"OKAY, FOLKS, TRYING
AGAIN FOR A BABY.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.592
THIS TIME THE
OLD-FASHIONED WAY."

17:41.394 --> 17:45.232
I SHOULD PROBABLY READ THESE IN MY
HEAD BEFORE I SAY THEM OUT LOUD.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.368
SO JACKIE'S HOOKING
UP WITH A NEW GUY?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.571
BACK IN THE SADDLE,
RIDING THE RANGE.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.241
OKAY OKAY, YES YES.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.375
HOW'D SHE FIND
SOMEBODY SO QUICKLY?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.644
OH, YOU KNOW JACKIE. YOU CAN'T
KEEP HER AWAY FROM MEN.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.381
SHE'S ALWAYS LEAVING
HER JACKET PLACES.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.516
AND HER PURSE.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.285
HOLY CRAP!

18:07.254 --> 18:09.422
THIS IS NOTHING SIGNIFICANT.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.358
AT ALL.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.429
( jazz music playing )

18:16.463 --> 18:19.466
TELL ME WHAT YOU
LOOKED LIKE AS A BABY.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.435
JACKIE, I CAN'T LIE...

18:22.469 --> 18:24.371
I WAS ADORABLE.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.406
SO WAS I.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.341
THIS KID WOULD HAVE
LIKE A 100% CHANCE

18:28.375 --> 18:31.478
OF BEING THE MOST GORGEOUS
BABY EVER CONCEIVED.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.480
YEAH, I GUESS IT'S
REALLY JUST MATH.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.448
YOU CAN'T DENY THE WORLD THAT.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.418
JOE, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE
PURE SENSUAL PLEASURE

18:38.451 --> 18:39.552
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.322
ALTHOUGH THERE IS THAT.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.158
BUT THIS IS ABOUT
DOING WHAT'S BEST

18:45.192 --> 18:46.493
FOR MANKIND.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.262
YEAH, MANKIND.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.898
I MEAN, I LOVE MANKIND.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.501
- MANKIND ROCKS.
- YEAH.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.503
JACKIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.305
OVULATING. GET OUT!

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
I NEED TO TALK TO JOE, OKAY?

18:59.739 --> 19:02.309
SO PUT YOUR EGGS
BACK IN YOUR PANTS.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.177
( music stops )

19:04.211 --> 19:05.478
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.447
YEAH, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE, BURKE.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.616
IT JUST BOILS DOWN TO
FUTURE GENERATIONS,

19:09.649 --> 19:14.187
MATH AND POSSIBLY THE
WORLD'S HOTTEST BABY.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.622
THIS IS NOT THE WAY YOU DO THIS.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.624
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT AND
IF I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.426
THIS MAY BE THE BEST
WAY FOR ME TO DO IT.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.494
BECOMING A PARENT IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU DO ON IMPULSE,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.563
LIKE BUYING HUBBA BUBBA
AT THE CHECKOUT COUNTER.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.433
- JOE HAS ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND.
- JACKIE, I'LL HANDLE THIS.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.635
LOOK, IF I'M GONNA HAVE A
BABY, IT'S GONNA BE MY CHOICE

19:28.668 --> 19:30.603
AND NOBODY ELSE'S,

19:30.637 --> 19:33.573
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THE OTHER PERSON.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.376
AND THAT OTHER PERSON
IS STANDING RIGHT HERE.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.345
JACKIE, IF THIS IS MEANT TO
HAPPEN, IT CAN HAPPEN TOMORROW.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.414
NO, NUH-UH, MY FERTILITY APP
SAYS TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.549
COME ON, JOE.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.652
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA KEEP ALL
THIS PERFECTION TO YOURSELF?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.620
SHE'S REALLY MAKING A
LOT OF SENSE HERE.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.456
SHE'S JUST USING YOU.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.591
MEL, THIS IS BETWEEN JOE AND ME.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.761
OKAY, THE REAL REASON YOU
CAN'T DO THIS IS BECAUSE

19:54.794 --> 19:57.497
I WANNA HAVE JOE'S BABY.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.332
- WHAT?!
- I GOT THIS.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.535
WHAT?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.637
JOE, I WANT WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.574
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

20:07.607 --> 20:10.677
TO HAVE YOUR PERFECT BABY.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.479
MEL, I HAD NO IDEA.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.481
NEITHER DID I.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.516
THOUGH, I GET IT.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.419
JACKIE, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.554
NO NO, I'M SORRY.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.457
IF I HAD KNOWN, I WOULD
HAVE NEVER GONE AFTER JOE.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.527
I MEAN, YOU KNEW HIM FIRST
SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S YOURS.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.431
WELL, IF YOU HURRY, I THINK YOU CAN STILL
GET SOME LARS BEFORE THE BANK CLOSES.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.600
YEAH, I GUESS I SHOULD MOVE ON.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.604
I MEAN, I'VE GOT A FEW MORE GOOD
HOURS AND A FEW MORE GOOD EGGS LEFT.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.273
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO TIME TO WASTE.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.576
THANKS, MEL. OH,
JOE, GOOD TIMES.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.681
BURKE, WHAT YOU
WERE JUST SAYING...

20:48.715 --> 20:50.617
