00:02.080 --> 00:05.000
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.120 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:21.000
<i>Michael Bluth was taking his son...</i>

00:21.120 --> 00:23.520
<i>to an interview at the prestigious
Milford School...</i>

00:23.640 --> 00:26.680
<i>an institution
once famous for its credo...</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:29.360
<i>that children should be
"neither seen nor heard. "</i>

00:29.440 --> 00:31.520
"Woman. "

00:33.000 --> 00:34.840
They're not getting in.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.840
- I might not get in either, and
that wouldn't be the end of the world.

00:37.875 --> 00:38.205
- Shh.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.680
We're not even going down
that road, okay?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.200
The next four years
are all about your future...

00:43.320 --> 00:45.400
and that's the most
important thing to me, okay?

00:45.480 --> 00:48.640
Things have changed around here.
We have talking sessions throughout the day.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.480
<i>We even have a talking room
where students are encouraged...</i>

00:51.560 --> 00:53.920
to go in and talk
to their heart's content.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.760
- Sounds like fun.
- First thing he's said all day.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.880
The point is I'm not my father.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.520
<i>I do think it's best
for the Milford School...</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:04.000
<i>to distance itself
from the Bluth name.</i>

01:04.120 --> 01:05.920
It's... nothing personal.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.400
Are you talking about the fact
that my father is in jail?

01:08.480 --> 01:11.040
Because I don't like to be
compared to my father either.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.080
- I don't mind being compared to my father.
- Save it for the talk room.

01:14.200 --> 01:14.685
- Sorry.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.400
- I can assure you that my
family is back on track...

01:18.520 --> 01:22.400
<i>- and no longer in any trouble.
- Not according to today's paper.</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:24.400
Oh, God.
What have we done this time?

01:28.360 --> 01:32.840
- Don't ever mention Klimpy's to me again.
- What did you do?

01:32.960 --> 01:36.560
If I still had money, I'd buy a Klimpy's
just to burn it to the ground.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.880
I know, Mom. You hate Klimpy's.
Tell me what happened.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.840
Your sister and I tried to get into
that new restaurant, Rud...

01:42.920 --> 01:44.840
and they wouldn't let us in.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.560
Mrs. Bluth, there's absolutely no room.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.560
Come on. I've suddenly lost my appetite.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.520
Oh, who's going to believe that?

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600
<i>With her blood sugar at a perilous low...</i>

01:53.720 --> 01:56.160
<i>Lucille made Lindsay pull into
the nearest restaurant.</i>

01:56.280 --> 01:59.120
Welcome to Klimpy's!
Anywhere you like!

01:59.200 --> 02:01.040
This does not bode well.

02:02.440 --> 02:06.480
- I'll have the Ike and Tina Tuna.
- Plate or platter?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.199
- I don't understand the question,
and I won't respond to it.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.800
- And what would you like?
- I'd like my old life back.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.800
So there really was no fight?

02:15.880 --> 02:18.800
Well, one tiny thing at the end.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.605
- How can you treat me this way?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.280
- Oh, please! Everything
I've said about you...

02:23.360 --> 02:26.960
can be covered with makeup
and a lie about a thyroid problem.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.645
Good grief almighty!

02:28.680 --> 02:32.520
You think I'm enjoying
my slide into poverty?

02:32.640 --> 02:35.680
Sorry, Lindsay.
There goes your dessert.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.040
Why don't you eat it, Mother?

02:39.160 --> 02:42.560
Why don't you just take this cake
and shove it...

02:42.680 --> 02:45.120
Hey, who called the cops?

02:45.240 --> 02:48.320
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.240
Totally blown out of proportion.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.680
<i>Well, listen, I think it cost George Michael
a chance to go to the Milford School.</i>

02:54.760 --> 02:58.840
Oh, big deal.
Buster's the only one who ever liked it.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.120
<i>Buster so excelled at being
neither seen nor heard...</i>

03:02.240 --> 03:05.200
<i>that he remained at the school
undetected for a full two semesters...</i>

03:05.280 --> 03:07.360
<i>after he was supposed to graduate.</i>

03:07.480 --> 03:09.760
Nonetheless, this bad press
is starting to taint my son's future...

03:09.880 --> 03:11.680
and we've got to put an end to it.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.400
Michael, if this is a
lecture on how we're all

03:13.435 --> 03:15.000
supposed to whatever
and blah, blah, blah...

03:15.080 --> 03:17.560
well, you can save it
'cause we all know it by heart.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.040
- Good-bye, Missus. - Lindsay, you'll
be happy to know that I have a new idea.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.440
I met a publicist today.
I'm gonna hire her.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.840
- We need somebody to make us look good.
- I say it's a waste of money.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.040
We're plenty sympathetic as we are.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.960
- Is this your onion?
- Yes.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.000
- What's in the foil?
- Nothing. It's a ball of foil for my son.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.320
Have a great day, sweetie.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.080
I don't know how she can't.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.840
So this publicist, Michael, is she cute?

03:46.920 --> 03:47.885
<i>I never really noticed.</i>

03:47.920 --> 03:49.800
<i>- In fact, Michael had
noticed her at the gym...</i>

03:49.920 --> 03:52.640
<i>but only recently gotten up
the nerve to talk to her...</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:55.440
<i>giving him a chance to work
on his flirting skills...</i>

03:55.520 --> 03:58.880
<i>- Race you to the top of the hill.
- which had gotten rusty over the years.</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:04.080
- I'll race you to the top of the hill.
- I brought a picnic lunch.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.160
- Hey, that hill was really...
- Jessie Bowers.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.480
If you ever have any
public relations needs...

04:09.600 --> 04:11.400
My relations are already
a little too public.

04:11.435 --> 04:12.200
I'm Michael Bluth.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.400
- From the Bluth Company?
- That's right.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.320
I'm giving you my direct line.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.760
<i>Okay, sure. She's...
She's cute, I suppose.</i>

04:19.839 --> 04:22.880
I mean, now that you're making me
think about it, uh, she's cute.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.960
She's a cutie. She's a little cutie pie.
But I never really noticed.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.400
- Why don't you just ask her out?
- That's not an option.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.800
<i>- 'Cause you're scared?
- No, because of George Michael.</i>

04:32.920 --> 04:34.720
He still hasn't gotten over
losing his mother.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.120
I just want to get him through high school;
then we'll deal with me.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.120
So you didn't get any
while you were in high school...

04:39.200 --> 04:42.840
and now you're not gonna get any
while George Michael's in high school.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.800
<i>And so the family gathered
at the model home...</i>

04:44.920 --> 04:47.240
<i>eager to hear
their new publicist's plan.</i>

04:47.360 --> 04:50.360
<i>- Get jobs and behave?
- Instead of us getting jobs...</i>

04:50.440 --> 04:52.720
why don't you do your job and
tell everyone we've got jobs?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.000
- I have a job.
- Kiss ass.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.520
<i>Well, we were all thinking it.</i>

04:57.600 --> 05:00.440
<i>Uh, I'm unclear about
what it is exactly you do.</i>

05:00.520 --> 05:01.760
Excellent question.
A publicist...

05:01.880 --> 05:04.000
No, no. I was talking
to George Michael.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.160
When did you get a job?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.680
- At the banana stand.
- Oh! Duh.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.960
I thought you meant like
a plumber or something.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.120
And I was like, "When did that happen?"

05:14.240 --> 05:16.480
<i>Jessie, why don't you just
go ahead andjump in here.</i>

05:16.600 --> 05:18.400
It's a tough group
to keep focused.

05:18.520 --> 05:22.000
I'm going on the offensive.
I want to get an article in the paper...

05:22.080 --> 05:24.920
to show that this is a functional family
and a relatable family.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.680
Are we on? Hello!
Hello from prison!

05:27.800 --> 05:30.600
<i>Thanks toJessie
for setting up this telelink.</i>

05:30.720 --> 05:33.480
I've started a Torah study group.
I'm very excited about it.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.280
Looks like... I don't know... looks like
I have some possible converts.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.880
Your father's religious now?
We'll play that up.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.640
- It's very sympathetic.
- Yeah. Who doesn't love theJews?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.720
And it allows me to put
Michael front and center.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.640
He needs to be
the new face of this family.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.000
He's the only likable one
in the bunch. No offense.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.480
<i>- None taken.
- I'm sorry.</i>

05:55.560 --> 05:57.680
Isn't Michael the least likable one
in the family?

05:57.760 --> 05:59.840
<i>No. There are very few intelligent...</i>

05:59.960 --> 06:03.000
attractive and straight men
in this town.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.920
Well, that certainly leaves me out.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.160
She... She said single.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.920
You did say "single," correct?
I thought I...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.840
I didn't quite hear that.
The reception is bad.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.760
But as the Talmud tells us...

06:19.280 --> 06:21.280
...to the jackal as to an oxen.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.520
Did it get a laugh?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.560
Sorry. I'm still on the whole
Michael being likable thing.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.600
<i>You know that he's only had sex
with, like, four women, right?</i>

06:29.720 --> 06:31.520
<i>Let's focus on your likability.</i>

06:31.640 --> 06:34.080
You're going to start doing
some charity work with your magic.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.600
<i>Actually, I'm kind of
the charitable one of the family.</i>

06:36.720 --> 06:39.280
<i>- I think it's best if you got a job.
- Oh, come on!</i>

06:39.360 --> 06:42.640
I'm a parent. I care about my daughter every
bit as much as Michael cares about his son.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.120
What grade am I in?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.520
<i>- What kind of job?
- Something where you'll be seen.</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:49.440
I represent Cloudmir Vodka...

06:49.560 --> 06:52.560
<i>and they want someone to promote it
by ordering it at a hot bar.</i>

06:52.640 --> 06:55.720
- A place like Rud.
- Okay. I'll do it.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.880
<i>And, Tobias,
you're a medical doctor...</i>

06:57.960 --> 07:00.400
and you're living an absurd fantasy
as an actor.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.440
- It's time to get real.
- Wow.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.920
It's tough talk, but I like it.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.160
You're saying land a major film.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.920
I'm saying get your medical license back.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.600
I've set up a hearing
for tomorrow in Boston.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.920
<i>- Michael has generously
donated $1,100 for your trip.</i>

07:15.955 --> 07:16.680
- I'm sorry.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.120
I truly believe that the universe wants me
to be an actor and not a doctor.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.040
- I'm just waiting for a sign.
- Here's your cash.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.880
- Universal Shuttle picks you up at 8:00.
- Any sign, really.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.480
Sorry. Some of my students
are arguing the significance...

07:30.560 --> 07:32.800
of the shank bone
on the seder plate.

07:32.880 --> 07:38.080
But that... Not... not wag our genitals
at one another to make a point.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.560
- Thought provoking.
- And, Lucille, people think you're cold.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.120
Hanukkah can be spelled so many ways.
Oh, God!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
- Buster.
- Right here. Ready to go.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.000
At your service.
Get me out there.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.920
<i>I want you to stay in.</i>

07:58.040 --> 08:00.400
<i>People find you
odd and alienating.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:03.080
<i>You make them uneasy.
Stay out of the spotlight.</i>

08:03.200 --> 08:07.000
I shall be neither seen nor heard.
Watch me.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.400
You can always tell a Milford man.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
<i>Each with their new charge...</i>

08:20.000 --> 08:22.480
<i>the Bluths set about
redefining their image.</i>

08:22.560 --> 08:25.360
<i>Tobias was off to Los Angeles
International Airport...</i>

08:25.440 --> 08:27.880
<i>determined to return
to his family with a career.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:29.800
Well, this is great.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.240
Why would anybody take a limo?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.720
What is this, like, $12?

08:34.799 --> 08:38.840
Why would anybody pay more than $12
to go to the airport?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.960
Next stop, LAX.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.000
Come on! We're stopping again?
How many more stops are we gonna make?

08:44.120 --> 08:48.640
Honestly, I haven't even seen
this part of Los Ang... Is that snow?

08:48.760 --> 08:50.560
<i>Really, now. This is ridiculous.</i>

08:50.680 --> 08:54.320
<i>I paid 12 American...
Oh, my God.</i>

08:54.400 --> 08:58.440
You are Carl Weathers, the actor.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.440
I went to San Francisco to attend
your stage fighting workshop.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.520
- But you never showed up.
- I got bumped from that flight.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.440
Hell, they'll give you $300
if you get bumped.

09:07.520 --> 09:12.160
It's this crazy loophole in the system
that the wrong guy discovered.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.000
Guess where I won't be going.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.400
Yeah. So...

09:19.520 --> 09:21.880
I am an actor too.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.960
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I want to be.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.280
Without the proper training,
I'm afraid I'm doomed to be a doctor.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.640
Well, hell, I can train you.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.240
Oh, well, I'm afraid
all I have is $1,100...

09:33.320 --> 09:35.640
and that's for this plane ticket, so...

09:35.720 --> 09:40.600
Check this out. $1,100 is exactly
what I charge for acting classes.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.280
- No, it isn't!
- Yeah.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.760
What are the chance...

09:44.880 --> 09:47.840
Universe, you've done it again.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.920
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was beginning
his charity work at a local nursing home.</i>

09:52.000 --> 09:56.160
I'm gonna need a volunteer
for my next illusion, the Aztec Tomb!

09:56.240 --> 09:59.520
<i>- A tomb?
- Or box. Box is... fine.</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:02.800
<i>Oh, yes! Well, excellent.
Let's get you in the box.</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:04.720
There's a panel.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.120
just flip it around, curl up behind it,
don't make any noise.

10:10.880 --> 10:15.680
<i>Ancient lore has it the Aztec gods
put a curse on any man who dare...</i>

10:15.800 --> 10:20.040
- What?
- He's gone.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.080
<i>Buster was also
doing his share for the family.</i>

10:27.520 --> 10:30.400
<i>And Michael, atJessie's insistence,
was out on the town.</i>

10:30.520 --> 10:33.000
I haven't been out to dinner in so long,
I feel a little guilty.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.440
You have nothing
to be guilty about.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.000
You're the only one in your family
who's ever been responsible.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.400
Well, I'm certainly the only one
that's ever held a real job.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.280
<i>Oh, really, Michael? Watch this.</i>

10:43.360 --> 10:45.760
Wow! This Cloudmir's
making me think fuzzy.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.360
I have almost no judgment at all.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.720
- Two more Cloudmirs, please.
- "Only one with a real job. "

10:53.400 --> 10:55.840
jessie, you've really been doing
a great job with my family.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.720
<i>- Oh, good. Get one of
Michael and me on a date.</i>

10:58.755 --> 10:59.480
- Sure.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.280
A date? This is a date now?
I thought this was just business.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.120
Can't it be a little bit of both?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.080
How will I know
which part of it is business?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.360
Uh-oh.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.200
Can't wait to see
which part of it is a date.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.080
Show me business again.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.920
<i>What you doing?</i>

11:27.040 --> 11:29.480
just trying to get the TVworking.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.360
Oh, yeah, I tried that earlier.
I think it's still hooked up to the prison.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.600
So when those guys kept saying,
"Hey, you, boy," that was me?

11:35.680 --> 11:39.480
- I was the boy?
- Sounds like it.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.640
Have you told your dad
you don't want to go to that school?

11:41.760 --> 11:45.120
I'm thinking of just going. I mean,
the graduates go on to do great things.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.160
I suppose, but that means we won't
be going to the same high school.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.920
Man, it just keeps getting worse.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.360
- But he's my Dad. I don't
want to disappoint him.

11:55.395 --> 11:55.765
- Man.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.960
You and I are so different.
It's like we're not even related.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.360
That'd be amazing.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.800
Oh, my God.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.040
<i>- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

12:11.160 --> 12:13.760
I'm sorry that I'm so late,
but I was with Jessie.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.640
This girl's making some serious progress
in getting you into that school.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.320
She just booked Gob a gig
at Earl Milford's nursing home.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.440
- You're gonna be a shoo-in.
- Oh.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.160
She's kinda something, isn't she?

12:24.280 --> 12:26.480
Yeah, I guess.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.240
I mean, you know, hey,
she is no replacement for your mom.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.280
- Oh, no. No way.
- Not at all.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.480
- She's just working for
us. You're not dating her.

12:34.515 --> 12:35.520
- No, I am not dating her.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.440
Absolutely not dating her.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.320
just you and me.
The Bluth boys.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.560
Bluth boys.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.800
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.200
- Is he in bed?
- He's on his way.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.280
Hey, listen, listen,
listen, listen.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.280
This might be moving
a little bit too fast for him.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.520
I mean for... for us.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.840
Me. Uh, for me.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.240
Maybe we should
take a step back...

13:10.360 --> 13:12.400
and just keep
this relationship professional.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.960
- Oh, I think that would
take all the fun out of it.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.240
- No. Seriously, seriously.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.400
You're amazing...

13:18.520 --> 13:21.120
- but I just think we should slow down.
- Uh-huh.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.800
So the two months on the bike,
that was, what, for my health?

13:24.920 --> 13:26.680
We had great conversations.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.920
- Seriously, this is hard for me.
- This is hard for me too.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.605
I've got a life to get on track,

13:31.640 --> 13:34.120
and I don't like wasting
time, so let's do this.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.720
Let's take two steps back...

13:36.800 --> 13:39.040
and why don't you find yourself
a new publicist.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.320
jessie.

13:44.440 --> 13:49.800
No. I was just saying your name
as you walked away. I didn't...

13:51.320 --> 13:53.880
I have no follow-up.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.360
Jessie.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.280
<i>Michael felt bad...</i>

13:59.360 --> 14:02.040
<i>- but he felt even worse when
he got a call from his brother.</i>

14:02.075 --> 14:02.485
- Hello.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.480
It's Gob. I'm looking forJessie.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.760
- She just left. What's wrong?
- I need her to spin something for me.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.680
Well, that's too bad
because I think she quit.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.240
- What do you need her to spin?
- Murder.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.720
<i>Michael was summoned to help his brother.</i>

14:20.800 --> 14:23.880
- Murder, huh? Who died?
- My career.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.640
- I'm going to go home now.
- I lost a guy.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.080
I put him in the Aztec Tomb,
and he disappeared.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.200
- Isn't that the point?
- This will ruin me.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.920
- He's probably fine. He just escaped.
- No! I need Jessie!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.720
Well, she quit when I told her
that I couldn't go out with her.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.640
You know, I have to do
the right thing for my son.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.080
Then you better get her back
because the guy I lost was Earl Milford.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.880
- What?
- I didn't know it was him.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.040
Although he was
spectacularly quiet in there.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.280
You can always tell a Milford man.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.080
Gob, have you destroyed my chance
at getting my son in that school?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.320
Not with the right spin.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.400
jessie. Get her back.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.000
<i>Charged with the task
of renewing his medical license...</i>

15:05.120 --> 15:08.800
<i>Tobias was enjoying his first acting class
with Carl Weathers.</i>

15:08.880 --> 15:12.000
I don't know what your police captain
told you about me...

15:12.080 --> 15:14.840
but I'm a different breed of cop.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.280
<i>I'm from the streets,
and I'm the last cop...</i>

15:18.400 --> 15:21.200
you're ever gonna wanna
mess with in a darkened alley.

15:21.280 --> 15:25.440
Dark alley. And I...

15:25.520 --> 15:27.480
Listen, Mr. Weathers,
I don't know.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.440
Perhaps my wife was right.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.800
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a...
a De Niro...

15:32.920 --> 15:36.280
or a Regis or a Pinkett-Smith
or what have you.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tobias.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.080
Dreams are worth fighting for.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.640
<i>Now, are you gonna be a fighter,
or are you gonna be a doctor?</i>

15:45.760 --> 15:47.640
You're right, Carl Weathers.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.320
I should just march into that restaurant
where my wife works and tell her...

15:51.400 --> 15:53.480
Your wife works in a restaurant?
Do they get a shift meal...

15:53.600 --> 15:56.280
or do they just pay half-price
on select menu items?

15:56.360 --> 16:00.280
- I don't know.
- Well, let's find out, man.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.280
<i>And the press got hold of Gob's story.</i>

16:02.400 --> 16:05.920
- Where is Earl Milford?
- I... I don't know, all right?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.160
I put him in a box.
I didn't kill him, all right?

16:08.240 --> 16:10.680
And don't edit this for your broadcast
so it looks like I'm screaming...

16:10.800 --> 16:12.360
"I killed Earl Milford. "

16:12.480 --> 16:14.600
Startling confession,
tonight at 11:00.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.640
<i>Minutes later, Gob unloaded his equipment...</i>

16:17.760 --> 16:19.920
<i>and made a surprising discovery.</i>

16:24.520 --> 16:28.920
Don't send me back.
They abuse us. It's not pleasant.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.840
Earl, I have to take you back.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.680
- It's the only way to clear my name.
- You'll have a new name:

16:34.760 --> 16:38.520
- Hero.
- Hero.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.560
That could work for me.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.360
<i>Meanwhile, Jessie decided
to pay George Michael a visit.</i>

16:43.440 --> 16:45.600
Hi, George Michael.
Proud of yourself?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.920
Yeah. I got a bum away from the stand
without hurting his feelings.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.320
<i>- That was pretty sweet.
- No. I mean about your father.</i>

16:50.400 --> 16:52.680
About denying him
his chance to be happy.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.520
You're into that too?
I'm rubbing off on you, huh?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.640
No. I want my dad to be happy.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.800
It's too late now.
I've seen to that.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.840
Daddy lost his shot at happy,
and it's all your fault, Opie.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.200
<i>Jessie had gone too far,
and she had best watch her mouth.</i>

17:06.280 --> 17:08.960
Michael's about to become
the most unlikable man in town.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.960
Check the papers.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.520
She kind of reminds me of my mother.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.000
<i>And later that night,
Lindsay was working at Rud.</i>

17:17.119 --> 17:20.680
You seem like a man of taste and class.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.160
I'll give you $2,000 to touch me.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.960
Oh, my God. My husband.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.760
You're married to Carl Weathers?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.480
What's going on? Why are you here?
Why aren't you in Boston?

17:32.600 --> 17:33.205
- Who's he?

17:33.240 --> 17:36.800
- His name is Carl Weathers,
and he's my new acting teacher.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.520
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
all these valuable life lessons.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.920
- I buy all my cars at police auction.
- He's full of stuff like that.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.320
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
to follow my dreams.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.640
Give me a bourbon.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.240
Any room on that tab
for me to jump on?

17:55.360 --> 17:57.160
<i>And Michael caught up with Jessie.</i>

17:57.280 --> 17:59.080
Listen, thanks for coming.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.080
I was just...
I was doing some thinking.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.240
You know, I pulled away,
and that was wrong.

18:03.360 --> 18:06.680
- I really want to make this work.
- Get away from my son!

18:06.760 --> 18:09.040
Hey, Mom.
Kind of on a date here.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.880
You'll change your mind after this.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.040
<i>And Michael saw the story
thatJessie had planted.</i>

18:17.120 --> 18:19.880
<i>Let me tell you something, sweetie.</i>

18:20.000 --> 18:21.960
We may pick on each other,
get into little scrapes...

18:22.080 --> 18:24.760
call each other names and
occasionally steal from each other...

18:24.840 --> 18:26.840
but that's because we're a family.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.600
You have no right.
You don't get to do that.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.400
"Lindsay's a combative,
entitled princess"?

18:31.520 --> 18:33.440
I should hire somebody
to kick your ass for that.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.720
- Save your money.
- Yeah, you're right. I'll do it myself.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.600
Hey, whoa! We are not settling things
like that anymore, all right?

18:39.680 --> 18:42.280
- I don't need my son
reading about us in the paper.

18:42.315 --> 18:43.440
- Oh, you and your son.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.520
Stop using him as an excuse
for everything you do.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.320
- I saw him today. He's fine with us.
- What? You saw him today?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.560
Yeah. I told him he was getting
in the way of your happiness.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.000
You did?
You said that to my son?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.280
Yeah.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.560
You're on your own.
Ladies?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.960
<i>Food fight!</i>

19:07.080 --> 19:09.360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19:09.440 --> 19:12.360
<i>Oh, my face!</i>

19:12.480 --> 19:15.680
<i>I'm gonna get you guys!
Stop!</i>

19:15.760 --> 19:18.160
<i>The press is having a love affair...</i>

19:18.240 --> 19:20.480
with hating the Bluth family...

19:20.600 --> 19:23.880
and they were the center
of another brawl this evening.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.440
I'm looking at $50,000 worth
of medical bills here.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.440
It looks like you won't be getting into
this school. Are you disappointed?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.800
Well, are you disappointed?

19:32.880 --> 19:36.280
Look, George Michael, I want you
to tell me how you feel, okay?

19:36.360 --> 19:38.520
I don't want you to worry so much
about hurting my feelings.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.880
I didn't want to go to that school,
and Jessie's a psycho.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.840
That could've saved us
a little bit of time.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.880
But, Dad, if you ever want to date
anyone else, that's fine with me.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah? Thanks, buddy.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.120
- 'Cause you know, I mean,
four women, that is kind of sad.

19:54.155 --> 19:55.360
- All right. Thank you.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.000
I know you got married in college,
but that was your sophomore year.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.600
- You had your whole freshman year to...
- That's enough honesty for now.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.880
- Thank you. Good night.
- There must have been girls at parties.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.080
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

20:07.200 --> 20:09.040
<i>Gob holds a press conference
ofhis own.</i>

20:09.120 --> 20:11.600
And, now, prepare
to call me "hero. "

20:15.040 --> 20:16.960
He's resting, so...
Oh.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.920
Pick a card.
Oh, boy.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.400
<i>And Buster moves
to the kitchen.</i>
