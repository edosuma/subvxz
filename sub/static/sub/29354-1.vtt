NETFLIX Presents

01:28.166 --> 01:32.708
MANY YEARS LATER

01:40.333 --> 01:41.708
<i>This is the evening news.</i>

01:41.958 --> 01:44.291
<i>The energy source brought back
by the Chinese spaceship</i>

01:44.375 --> 01:46.041
<i>is officially named "Xianteng."</i>

01:46.666 --> 01:47.833
<i>Within just a few years,</i>

01:47.916 --> 01:51.166
<i>it has replaced traditional energy sources
such as oil and coal.</i>

01:51.875 --> 01:54.916
<i>Cities in possession of Xianteng
have seen unprecedented development.</i>

01:57.750 --> 02:00.166
<i>We are living in an era
with Xianteng as the game-changer.</i>

02:01.875 --> 02:04.666
<i>It has ushered human beings
onto the track of fast development,</i>

02:05.541 --> 02:07.083
<i>but it has lured unexpected visitors.</i>

02:07.166 --> 02:09.416
RIO DE JANEIRO The
alien spaceship...

02:09.666 --> 02:11.500
<i>An alien mother ship was spotted over Rio,</i>

02:11.666 --> 02:13.125
<i>causing turmoil across the city.</i>

02:13.208 --> 02:15.666
<i>Experts say Xianteng
could be the target of the mother ship.</i>

02:16.000 --> 02:17.083
<i>I can assure you</i>

02:17.416 --> 02:20.208
<i>that the United States military
is prepared to defend the state.</i>

02:20.291 --> 02:22.000
<i>The mother ship and annihilators</i>

02:22.083 --> 02:24.833
<i>launched surprise attacks,
and cities in possession of Xianteng</i>

02:24.916 --> 02:26.375
<i>suffered severe damage.</i>

02:26.458 --> 02:29.625
<i>The alien mother ship reappeared
over the city, beginning an attack.</i>

02:29.708 --> 02:32.583
<i>The cities were plunged into ruin
after the loss of Xianteng.</i>

02:34.083 --> 02:36.458
<i>The mother ship gradually
destroyed our homeland.</i>

02:39.166 --> 02:41.833
<i>Countries joined forces
to defend against the enemy.</i>

02:45.208 --> 02:46.708
<i>According to today's headlines,</i>

02:46.791 --> 02:49.250
<i>heads of 97 countries held
an emergency meeting in Shanghai</i>

02:49.333 --> 02:51.750
<i>to establish
the United Nations Defense Commission.</i>

02:51.916 --> 02:53.416
<i>We pooled all energy resources</i>

02:53.500 --> 02:54.875
<i>to build a defense system.</i>

02:55.583 --> 02:56.666
<i>Our life was set back</i>

02:56.750 --> 02:58.833
<i>as we began a long battle
against the mother ship.</i>

02:58.916 --> 03:00.916
<i>CBSS broadcasting live in Los Angeles.</i>

03:01.083 --> 03:02.666
<i>In the last five minutes, the...</i>

03:23.875 --> 03:25.291
Bring in the enemy fleet.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.375
Aircraft one and two.

03:26.666 --> 03:27.666
- Roger.
- Roger.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.208
Zeng Yu, look at your left wing.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.750
Roger that.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.708
Lu Yiyi, get ready to fire.

03:39.791 --> 03:40.791
Got it.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.708
Aircraft Three, lead the fleet
to the attacking position.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.041
You guys hang in there.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.000
Get more annihilators into
the firing range and concentrate fire.

03:48.625 --> 03:49.625
But, Jiang Yang,

03:49.666 --> 03:51.166
how long do I need to hang on?

03:51.708 --> 03:54.750
Jiang Yang, more annihilators
will enter the firing range in 15 seconds.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.125
Captain Pan is on a roll today!

03:56.541 --> 03:57.666
Focus on coordination.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.583
- Roger!
- Roger!

03:58.666 --> 04:00.500
Pincer attack.
Hey, it's three against one!

04:00.625 --> 04:01.625
There's not much time.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.625
Zeng Yu, bait them.
Lead them into an ambush.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.333
Why is it me again?

04:05.875 --> 04:07.541
When it comes to speed,
you're our best.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.500
COMMANDER LIN LAN

04:28.083 --> 04:29.333
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SHAO YIYUN

04:29.416 --> 04:31.000
- How is it?
- They're practicing.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.625
Not bad. They're obviously improving.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.750
They get the tactical principles,

04:41.833 --> 04:44.000
but they still need to work
on coordinating as a team.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.083
Also, commanding a fighter like the AV28,

04:47.166 --> 04:48.500
a dual-system aircraft,

04:48.833 --> 04:51.125
is still a big challenge for them.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.500
Although their training has been good,

04:54.291 --> 04:55.791
they haven't been in real combat.

04:57.625 --> 04:58.708
If they don't fight,

04:58.791 --> 04:59.958
they won't get used to it.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.333
Make their training harder.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.666
Until now, nobody has seen

05:05.208 --> 05:06.791
what the AV28 really looks like.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.916
What's the real purpose
of training them so hard?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.666
The drones' combat performance is high.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.291
Who's piloting it?

05:19.375 --> 05:20.375
It's Jiang Yang.

05:21.958 --> 05:22.958
You're right.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.333
He is the most talented,

05:25.333 --> 05:26.333
while Zeng Yu

05:27.208 --> 05:28.416
is the most vigilant one.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.125
Lu Yiyi is good at
real-time data analysis.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.250
But Jiang Yang is still the best overall.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.041
The dual-system is
not a problem for him.

05:40.791 --> 05:42.875
Zeng Yu, Lu Yiyi,
roll your aircraft.

05:42.958 --> 05:43.958
Got it.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.416
Hey!

05:46.500 --> 05:47.791
I haven't responded.

05:47.958 --> 05:48.958
Why did you fire at me?

05:49.791 --> 05:51.708
I've already asked you to roll.

05:51.875 --> 05:52.875
What?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.458
Can the Gray Eagle Squad

05:56.291 --> 05:57.291
achieve our goal?

06:01.250 --> 06:03.291
I was the one who selected them.

06:04.458 --> 06:05.958
I believe in my own judgment.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.958
<i>I, Jiang Yang,</i>

06:23.416 --> 06:26.583
<i>was part of the Shanghai Fortress
Shield Command Center Logistics Team.</i>

06:26.958 --> 06:28.666
<i>A member of the Gray Eagle Squad,</i>

06:29.666 --> 06:32.166
<i>I was in charge of energy output
and defense for Xiangteng.</i>

06:33.083 --> 06:34.375
<i>I also did some combat training.</i>

06:35.000 --> 06:36.375
<i>At that time, I didn't know why</i>

06:36.541 --> 06:38.416
<i>I needed to go through such training.</i>

06:39.208 --> 06:40.750
<i>Ever since the alien mother ship</i>

06:40.833 --> 06:42.666
<i>invaded our planet five years ago,</i>

06:42.750 --> 06:45.000
<i>the war over Xianteng has begun.</i>

06:45.083 --> 06:47.958
<i>Over the past five years, cities such as
Rio, New York, Tokyo, Moscow,</i>

06:48.041 --> 06:49.791
<i>and also New Delhi recently,
have fallen.</i>

06:50.666 --> 06:53.083
<i>Shanghai</i> was the last
standing fortress.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.083
<i>The Shanghai Cannon, developed by China,</i>

06:57.166 --> 06:58.916
- Roger.
<i>- Was the world's last hope.</i>

07:00.041 --> 07:01.166
<i>The Gray Eagle Squad and I,</i>

07:01.333 --> 07:05.125
as well as thousands of other people,
would stay here and fight.

07:05.791 --> 07:08.000
<i>The Shield Command Center</i>

07:08.625 --> 07:10.750
- <i>is adjusting the temperature</i>
- Wait a minute.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.583
<i>To 23 degrees Celsius.</i>

07:13.291 --> 07:15.083
- Air humidity...
- Going down.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.208
Going down.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.291
Today is a special day.

07:26.958 --> 07:28.500
I've prepared a surprise for her.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.000
Third floor, Command Center.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.375
Commander Lin is not here.

07:34.458 --> 07:35.750
- This thing...
- It's...

07:35.916 --> 07:38.000
Commander Lin,
Commander Yang is waiting for you.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.083
Happy birthday, Lin Ian.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.250
Thank you.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.083
UNDC

08:18.375 --> 08:19.666
LIN LAN

08:23.083 --> 08:30.000
MY PERFORMANCE TODAY
WAS GREAT, RIGHT?

08:33.541 --> 08:40.541
MY PERFORMANCE TODAY
WASN'T SO BAD, RIGHT?

08:48.500 --> 08:53.875
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF
MY PERFORMANCE TODAY?

09:29.958 --> 09:36.958
LIN LAN: IT'S NOT BAD.
SLEEP WELL. GOOD NIGHT.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.416
<i>I always wondered</i>

09:46.958 --> 09:49.000
<i>when she would notice me,</i>

09:50.833 --> 09:53.750
<i>when my days with the defense system
would end</i>

09:55.708 --> 09:58.208
<i>and what could protect
our fragile planet.</i>

11:41.125 --> 11:42.958
SHANGHAI FORTRESS

11:43.083 --> 11:47.208
BASED ON THE NOVEL
<i>SHANGHAI FORTRESS</i> BY JIANGNAN.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.708
Those are the ashes of New Delhi,

12:20.625 --> 12:23.000
blown here by the storms
from the West Indian Ocean.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.416
After Xianteng was taken
by the Delta Mother Ship,

12:27.291 --> 12:29.166
3,600 UNDC soldiers

12:29.708 --> 12:32.791
and the whole city
vanished just like that.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.291
With your clearance,

12:35.541 --> 12:36.875
I'm sure you've gotten

12:37.125 --> 12:39.333
information for the defense of New Delhi.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.958
Currently,
the staff is studying the data.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.125
Hopefully, it'll be useful data
for our defense.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.000
Although our defense technology

12:48.125 --> 12:49.541
is the most advanced in the world,

12:50.083 --> 12:51.958
we must never let our guard down.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.125
Commander Lin.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.625
Are you ready to fight?

13:00.875 --> 13:02.541
Chief, a Code Red meeting was called.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.750
The Delta Mother Ship has arrived.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.750
It's over Shanghai.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.416
- <i>Emergency notice for all personnel</i>.
- Go to the shelter.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.041
- And you?
- Be careful.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.583
- Hurry up.
- You too!

13:47.666 --> 13:48.750
Don't worry. Take care.

13:48.833 --> 13:53.083
- Enter battle stage. All staff, stand by.
- Commanders, please be in position.

14:04.458 --> 14:05.458
CONFIRMED

14:08.125 --> 14:09.125
Testing power.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.291
Shield battle mode.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.541
- Roger.
- Roger.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.208
Shield battle mode initializing.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.833
Number nine.
Engaging self-propelled gun.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.000
All troops, depart!

14:17.875 --> 14:19.166
Artillery team transferred.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.500
Hurry, keep up with the vehicle in front.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.875
All drones enter standby mode.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.083
Roger that.

15:02.791 --> 15:04.916
The mother ship's laser hit zones
D37 and D39.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.166
Aforementioned regions
have partially collapsed.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.500
Number three to seven, repair immediately.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.833
Roger that. Repairing now.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.375
Logistics. Attention, Logistics.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.458
Logistics Team, over.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.458
Report on Xianteng's status
of energy supply.

15:22.833 --> 15:23.833
Status is normal.

15:23.875 --> 15:24.875
Noted.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.250
All parties, get ready.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.583
Drone D37, intercept the annihilators.

15:51.666 --> 15:52.833
Drone troop, depart.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.458
Autonomous attack.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.291
Drive the annihilators out of Lujiazui.

16:56.958 --> 16:57.958
Drones, attack!

16:58.375 --> 16:59.500
Be sure to avoid the crowd.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.665
An annihilator is flying
towards the center.

17:27.708 --> 17:28.708
Drones.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.708
- Frontal interception at Waibaidu Bridge.
- Got it.

17:35.583 --> 17:36.583
Where's Jiang Yang?

17:36.625 --> 17:38.000
Why isn't he here
when we need him?

17:38.833 --> 17:39.833
It's his day off today.

17:39.916 --> 17:40.916
He went to see a friend.

17:40.958 --> 17:44.083
<i>All system units operational.</i>

17:45.666 --> 17:48.750
Everyone, please go to the fourth floor.

17:48.833 --> 17:52.166
- <i>All system units operational.</i>
- Duo Duo!

18:17.583 --> 18:19.625
Get away!

18:22.666 --> 18:25.125
A giant Predator has appeared
near the command center.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.833
- Commander, over here.
- Hurry!

18:27.916 --> 18:29.041
- Hurry!
- Over here!

18:42.750 --> 18:43.833
Hide!

18:52.708 --> 18:54.708
You there, go up!

18:54.791 --> 18:55.916
- Roger!
- Roger!

18:56.833 --> 18:57.750
Number 11.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.500
Quickly mobilize the artillery team
to support the area.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.333
Roger. D38, coordinate 135.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.291
Attention, drone troop.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.791
Press on and surround them.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.250
Force the enemies into Zone D9.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.333
Roger.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.083
Driving Predators into Zone D9.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.541
Requesting fire support.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.666
Don't go anywhere.

19:25.958 --> 19:26.958
Find shelter!

19:57.625 --> 19:59.500
The mother ship has evacuated.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.333
Code Red alert dismissed.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.500
This time, its goal is clear.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.000
It's coming to take
Shanghai's Xianteng.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.791
SHANGHAI CANNON COMMANDER
YANG JIANNAN

20:21.041 --> 20:21.958
Commander.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.958
We have completed analysis
of the delta-class mother ship

20:25.125 --> 20:27.416
and we believe we have found
a weakness in its defenses,

20:28.166 --> 20:30.166
a weakness that
the Shanghai Cannon can exploit.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.041
And I strongly believe
we should consider this option.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.250
Our victory

20:35.541 --> 20:37.500
proves the capability of
our defense systems.

20:38.041 --> 20:40.208
This could be the only
opportunity we have

20:40.666 --> 20:41.958
to counterattack.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.875
Council members,

20:46.416 --> 20:47.666
rushing to attack

20:48.166 --> 20:51.041
without knowing more about
the enemy capabilities

20:51.125 --> 20:54.666
would definitely put the survival
of all humanity at risk.

20:58.541 --> 21:00.083
Can we afford that?

21:28.083 --> 21:29.166
Fire system, normal.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.166
Power system empowerment, normal.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.291
Filling energy by 30 percent.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.000
Empowering power system by 60 percent.

21:39.750 --> 21:40.875
Guidance system, normal.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.125
Approving full gun data.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.500
Prepare to fire.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.416
Report, operational readiness data,
normal.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.166
Get ready for battle.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.250
Roger.

23:41.541 --> 23:43.141
You'll finally see it
with your own eyes.

23:48.958 --> 23:49.958
Lin Ian.

23:50.416 --> 23:53.791
Abyss A-level authority.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.708
Entry approved.

24:10.625 --> 24:13.791
When mankind brought back
Xianteng from outer space,

24:14.083 --> 24:16.333
we never thought it would be able
to replicate itself

24:16.916 --> 24:18.500
and produce a huge amount of energy.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.125
Now, in the depths of the Earth,

24:21.291 --> 24:23.708
it has covered the entire Shanghai.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.625
It's not just the Shield.

24:26.708 --> 24:28.000
Our Shanghai Cannon

24:28.541 --> 24:30.375
and Shanghai's energy

24:31.375 --> 24:32.375
all depend on Xianteng.

24:33.541 --> 24:34.833
Due to excessive consumption,

24:35.541 --> 24:37.791
Xianteng's energy often
fluctuates abnormally.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.875
We must always prepare for the worst.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.916
Is this why you don't want
to use the Shanghai Cannon?

24:45.708 --> 24:46.708
No.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.500
It's not that I don't want to,

24:50.666 --> 24:52.750
but I need be prepared
for the worst outcome.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.708
Once the cannon is fired,
it will decrease Xianteng's energy.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.166
By that time, the energy left

24:58.791 --> 25:00.625
may be unable
to support the Shield anymore.

25:02.833 --> 25:05.416
The AV28 plan is designed

25:05.666 --> 25:07.041
to deal with this situation.

25:13.416 --> 25:16.916
But can the AV28 plan replace the Shield?

25:34.708 --> 25:35.708
Hey.

25:36.375 --> 25:37.958
If there were no aliens,

25:38.333 --> 25:39.333
what would we be doing?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.166
I wanted to learn about AI,

25:41.750 --> 25:44.000
but my parents didn't take me seriously.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.000
I would build them a robot

25:47.416 --> 25:48.833
and show them I could be great!

25:50.666 --> 25:51.833
What about you, Lu Yiyi?

25:54.666 --> 25:55.666
Me?

25:55.750 --> 25:56.833
I'd go to a film school.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.208
If I don't pass,

25:59.291 --> 26:00.875
I'd get married
and live a simple life.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.375
Do film academies

26:02.458 --> 26:05.041
need someone with a neural response
of more than 186?

26:05.625 --> 26:06.458
Pan.

26:06.541 --> 26:07.708
- Yes?
- What about you?

26:08.625 --> 26:09.625
Me?

26:10.833 --> 26:13.375
I'd open a motorbike service shop.

26:14.625 --> 26:15.875
And when the weather is good,

26:16.041 --> 26:17.458
I'd ride on a bike with my wife

26:17.541 --> 26:19.000
and go to the mountains.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.375
What wife?

26:20.500 --> 26:22.708
Other than Yiyi,
you never talk to other girls.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.041
I don't want to think too much.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.000
I want to become a commander soon.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.500
- Me too!
- Count me in.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.041
Hope our dreams come true.

26:36.416 --> 26:37.416
- Come.
- Come.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.208
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

26:44.833 --> 26:45.750
After we win the war,

26:45.833 --> 26:47.208
we can do whatever we want.

26:54.666 --> 26:55.666
What's happening?

26:58.708 --> 26:59.708
Hurry.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.458
It seems in order to get Xianteng,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.458
they plan to eradicate

27:10.750 --> 27:11.958
all of Shanghai by tonight.

27:13.333 --> 27:16.083
The Nanpu Bridge in Zone D53
was attacked by the mother ship.

27:16.166 --> 27:17.458
The Shield is badly damaged.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.208
Number two to five, repair it.

27:20.958 --> 27:21.833
- Roger.
- Roger.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.666
Drone troop.
Close the gap. Prepare for aerial battle.

27:26.041 --> 27:27.041
Got it.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.000
Number eight and nine.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.583
Assemble the artillery and self-propelled
unit to assist at Nanpu Bridge.

27:33.958 --> 27:35.416
The objective is Nanpu Bridge.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.000
Faster. Take off!

27:39.500 --> 27:44.375
NANPU BRIDGE ZONE D37

27:52.125 --> 27:54.125
Attention, 30 seconds to countdown.

27:54.291 --> 27:56.250
The mother ship will attack us next.

28:00.041 --> 28:01.250
Speed up the repair.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.875
Adjust the input to the maximum.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.458
Input adjusted to the maximum.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.458
What are you looking at?

28:40.583 --> 28:41.583
This is not right.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.121
FUEL STORAGE CONTROL SYSTEM

28:52.625 --> 28:54.958
Why're they guarding the crack
but not attacking?

28:56.541 --> 28:57.875
What are they waiting for?

29:00.875 --> 29:02.083
It's a trap.

29:12.791 --> 29:15.125
Xianteng's alarm shows instability.

29:15.791 --> 29:18.041
The repair at Nanpu Bridge
consumed a lot of energy.

29:22.708 --> 29:23.750
Command Center.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.791
Nanpu Bridge is just a ruse.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.625
The Predators are waiting for us

29:28.708 --> 29:30.791
to use up a lot of energy.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.500
If the energy drops,
it can't support the Shield.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.541
Then, they can attack
any area they want.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.333
Yiyi, be careful.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.250
We have a situation.
Stay on guard!

30:05.041 --> 30:06.500
Pay attention to the target.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.500
There!

30:43.416 --> 30:44.416
Everyone,

30:44.666 --> 30:45.666
get your weapons ready

30:46.250 --> 30:48.125
and protect the command center!

30:48.833 --> 30:50.833
Protect the command center!

30:52.375 --> 30:54.416
The target is over there! Attack!

30:58.166 --> 30:59.625
Shoot at nine o'clock!

31:05.083 --> 31:06.083
Stay alert.

31:08.041 --> 31:09.208
The team is under attack!

31:09.291 --> 31:10.500
We can't see them at all!

31:10.583 --> 31:12.708
We need backup!

31:24.166 --> 31:25.250
Quick.

31:28.958 --> 31:31.458
- Units, get ready. Increase firepower!
- Let's go.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500
Seek cover!

31:40.583 --> 31:41.583
Stay alert.

31:41.666 --> 31:42.666
Shoot!

31:47.208 --> 31:48.458
Damn it!

31:53.583 --> 31:55.250
Watch out!

32:02.083 --> 32:03.083
Get away.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.125
Outflank and attack!

32:13.083 --> 32:14.708
- Zeng Yu.
- What is it?

32:15.208 --> 32:16.625
The drones!

32:17.375 --> 32:18.375
What?

32:20.083 --> 32:21.958
- Come with me.
- Attack!

32:23.375 --> 32:24.375
Go!

32:26.375 --> 32:28.166
Lost contact with the command center.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.500
The Shield is in an emergency.

32:31.958 --> 32:33.000
Contact Shanghai Cannon.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.333
Power supply system is normal.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.708
Prepare to launch cannon!

33:03.083 --> 33:04.791
Gray Eagle Squad reporting for duty.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.458
Permission granted.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.583
Everyone, prepare for battle.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.583
The ship's attacking again.

33:13.666 --> 33:15.166
The Shield needs to be repaired.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.250
Pan Hantian, Zeng Yu,

33:16.416 --> 33:18.291
repair the crack above
the command center.

33:18.875 --> 33:19.875
Lu Yiyi, count down.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.750
Countdown for the next
attack, 120 seconds.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.208
Assisting Commander Lin,
control the drones.

33:26.750 --> 33:27.666
Jiang Yang,

33:27.750 --> 33:30.541
activate low flight mode,
assist in defending the command center.

33:30.625 --> 33:31.708
Got it.

33:41.666 --> 33:43.250
Drones, our drones.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.250
Energy level is abnormal.
Energy flow is changing.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.166
- Energy output less than 40%.
- Energy dropping!

34:00.250 --> 34:02.125
- Unable to repair.
- We can't hold it anymore!

34:02.500 --> 34:03.500
Calm down!

34:05.875 --> 34:06.875
Take position.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.333
Yang Jiannan.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.166
We are counting on you now.

35:05.958 --> 35:07.125
Now is the crucial time.

35:07.333 --> 35:08.500
We can't panic.

35:09.666 --> 35:12.125
We have to try our best
to repair the Shield.

35:20.208 --> 35:21.708
Counting down for the attack.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.500
Ten.

35:30.541 --> 35:31.541
Nine.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.500
Eight.

35:38.666 --> 35:39.958
Seven.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.083
Six.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.291
Five.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.583
Four.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.333
Three.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.000
Two.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.625
One.

36:44.875 --> 36:45.708
This is great!

36:45.875 --> 36:47.541
Yeah.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.583
The mother ship is gone.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.375
Shanghai Cannon back to position.

36:52.250 --> 36:55.250
The mother ship is gone.
The Shield is back to normal.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.250
<i>Being a commander for the first time...</i>

37:30.166 --> 37:32.666
<i>we had mixed feelings.</i>

37:35.250 --> 37:36.833
<i>Zeng Yu told his parents he was safe.</i>

37:37.666 --> 37:39.416
<i>He went to the roof to drink alone.</i>

37:41.958 --> 37:44.583
<i>Pan cleaned his motorbike
until it shined</i>

37:45.041 --> 37:46.666
<i>and he cleaned the dormitory too.</i>

37:49.083 --> 37:51.375
<i>Lu Yiyi wrote a diary entry that night.</i>

37:52.125 --> 37:54.000
<i>No one knew what she wrote.</i>

37:59.125 --> 38:01.916
<i>While I could finally
fight as commander</i>

38:02.708 --> 38:03.908
<i>next to the girl of my dreams</i>.

38:08.291 --> 38:11.125
<i>The night sky had returned
to normal.</i>

38:12.583 --> 38:14.333
<i>Shanghai was no longer under threat.</i>

38:15.791 --> 38:17.750
<i>In this hard-won peace,</i>

38:18.958 --> 38:22.125
<i>we were enjoying our long-lost freedom.</i>

38:43.625 --> 38:45.041
Why are you the one driving?

38:47.500 --> 38:49.083
Because you're dreaming.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.333
Stop sleeping.

39:01.458 --> 39:02.458
The sun is up.

39:05.666 --> 39:06.666
What is this?

39:07.833 --> 39:08.833
Our new uniform.

39:09.708 --> 39:12.666
Good morning,
Commander Jiang Yang.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.375
Did you hear that?

39:14.541 --> 39:15.666
Commander Jiang Yang.

39:17.958 --> 39:20.083
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39:21.041 --> 39:22.500
What are you two doing?

39:23.291 --> 39:24.291
What's wrong with you?

39:24.375 --> 39:25.375
Can't you knock?

39:25.416 --> 39:26.583
I'm not dressed yet.

39:27.291 --> 39:28.625
Come on.

39:28.708 --> 39:29.958
I've known you for so long.

39:30.041 --> 39:31.750
I even know how much hair you have.

39:32.166 --> 39:33.375
- Hey.
- Huh?

39:33.500 --> 39:34.541
I found a great place.

39:34.625 --> 39:35.875
Let's go celebrate.

39:37.750 --> 39:38.625
Wow.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.875
MO What do you think?

39:41.333 --> 39:42.166
Hey.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.375
Let's get moving.

39:44.291 --> 39:45.666
Hurry up.

39:46.416 --> 39:47.416
Hey.

39:49.291 --> 39:50.291
Lu Yiyi.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.625
It wasn't easy for me to win the battle
and then get promoted.

39:54.708 --> 39:56.166
Why did we come here?

39:59.708 --> 40:00.708
Password?

40:00.833 --> 40:01.833
My birthday.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.541
Just pull it.

40:09.833 --> 40:11.208
You guys are so gullible.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.625
Cheers!

40:29.416 --> 40:30.333
What do you guys think?

40:30.416 --> 40:31.416
It's great.

40:31.625 --> 40:33.041
This place is amazing!

40:33.125 --> 40:34.625
I'm not surprised!

40:35.125 --> 40:37.625
This place is similar to my dad's
college prom.

40:37.791 --> 40:39.375
Please be grateful, okay?

40:39.458 --> 40:42.125
After the war started,
entertainment has regressed so much.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.000
Having unlimited alcohol is enough.

40:44.666 --> 40:46.375
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

40:46.541 --> 40:47.791
Yiyi, make a toast.

40:48.208 --> 40:50.875
To defeating aliens,
and saving Shanghai and the world.

40:51.458 --> 40:52.708
That's so cliche.

40:52.791 --> 40:53.875
Say something romantic.

40:53.958 --> 40:54.958
That's right.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.250
Then...

40:57.333 --> 40:59.458
Here's to hoping people in love
will stay together,

40:59.541 --> 41:01.416
defeating aliens, and saving the world.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.541
Come.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.833
I AM THE DESIGNER OF MY OWN CATASTROPHY

41:31.291 --> 41:33.041
Isn't the bar you set for yourself

41:33.625 --> 41:35.000
a bit too high?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.708
You don't need to tell me.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.291
I know everything.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.041
Hey.

41:46.125 --> 41:48.291
If you really like her,
you should bring her here.

41:48.916 --> 41:50.625
This is the hippest place
in Shanghai now.

41:53.750 --> 41:54.750
I don't know...

41:54.958 --> 41:56.750
Aren't you going to give her the flower?

41:56.833 --> 41:58.416
You need to let her know.

41:59.291 --> 42:00.458
I want to give it to her.

42:01.708 --> 42:02.875
But I don't like rejection.

42:10.416 --> 42:12.208
You'll just keep your feelings hidden?

42:12.875 --> 42:14.333
I've heard that

42:14.875 --> 42:15.875
when you love someone,

42:16.125 --> 42:18.166
love as if there's five minutes left
in your life.

42:20.916 --> 42:21.916
What if...

42:22.416 --> 42:23.958
there's really only five minutes?

42:39.708 --> 42:41.208
<i>During the battle a week ago,</i>

42:41.291 --> 42:44.125
<i>the China-made Shanghai Cannon
made its debut</i>

42:44.291 --> 42:47.375
<i>and successfully hit the mother ship
during the crucial moment.</i>

42:47.458 --> 42:50.500
<i>The mother ship suffered
a severe malfunction and retreated.</i>

42:51.375 --> 42:54.916
<i>In mankind's battle against aliens,</i>

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
<i>a counterattack was made
for the first time.</i>

42:57.333 --> 43:01.333
<i>Shanghai Fortress has turned the situation
around and emerged victorious.</i>

43:05.416 --> 43:07.625
GLOBAL JOINT DEFENSE COMMITTEE

43:14.500 --> 43:17.250
Chief Commander, <i>Yang Jiannan,</i>

43:17.875 --> 43:22.166
<i>has displayed extraordinary bravery
and fighting spirit</i>

43:22.583 --> 43:25.416
<i>against the invading Delta Mother Ship.</i>

43:26.750 --> 43:29.083
On behalf of the Commission,

43:29.791 --> 43:33.083
I hereby promote Yang Jiannan

43:33.750 --> 43:35.750
to brigadier general.

43:46.791 --> 43:47.958
Thank you.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.541
<i>Let's welcome Brigadier General
Yang Jiannan.</i>

43:52.875 --> 43:53.875
This is Shanghai,

43:55.458 --> 43:56.916
the city I live in,

43:59.041 --> 44:00.125
where I am surrounded

44:00.791 --> 44:02.041
by my friends,

44:02.541 --> 44:03.541
my comrades,

44:04.041 --> 44:05.041
and my loved ones.

44:08.041 --> 44:09.541
This is too cheesy.

44:09.833 --> 44:11.708
Professing your love
at such an occasion?

44:12.083 --> 44:13.458
If I were Lin Ian,

44:13.791 --> 44:15.750
I would've cried and accepted his love.

44:16.041 --> 44:18.291
- The two of them...
- <i>protect Xianteng.</i>

44:25.625 --> 44:27.291
Please advise.

44:32.833 --> 44:34.000
Give it to me.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.375
It's mine.

44:40.458 --> 44:41.375
Don't take it.

44:41.458 --> 44:42.458
Don't disturb me.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.625
It's mine.

44:47.625 --> 44:49.458
KIKI NOODLE SHOP

44:52.041 --> 44:53.208
Commander, you're here.

44:53.375 --> 44:54.666
- The usual?
- Yes.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.958
I thought the food
at the command center

45:05.125 --> 45:06.458
should be quite good?

45:07.958 --> 45:09.791
Why are you two eating here?

45:12.166 --> 45:13.291
Your noodles taste better.

45:23.166 --> 45:24.166
In this battle,

45:25.416 --> 45:27.708
we have sacrificed 16 members
of the command center.

45:29.875 --> 45:32.833
Battle reports from the defense center
and other troops

45:33.208 --> 45:34.500
are still being analyzed.

45:36.291 --> 45:38.125
Now do you know
the actual feeling of war?

45:40.375 --> 45:41.375
Think about it.

45:41.416 --> 45:43.666
Every decision determines
the survival of Shanghai.

45:44.541 --> 45:46.041
After you feel that pressure,

45:46.708 --> 45:48.125
maybe you'd live differently.

45:54.791 --> 45:57.041
Like me.
Now, I decided not to lose weight.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
I'll eat tons of noodles.

46:00.416 --> 46:02.958
Then I have to prepare
a little more for you.

46:13.625 --> 46:14.625
Happy birthday.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.458
I can finally give you this.

46:50.625 --> 46:51.750
I'll leaving.

46:58.666 --> 46:59.666
Thank you, Jiang Yang.

47:11.208 --> 47:12.875
RECIPIENT: LIN LAN

47:12.958 --> 47:16.208
DO YOU HAVE SOME TIME TOMORROW?

47:16.291 --> 47:17.458
CONFIRM SEND SENDING

47:19.208 --> 47:20.791
NEW MESSAGE

47:20.875 --> 47:24.500
LIN LAN: YES, SLEEP WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

47:30.291 --> 47:33.583
I think it's okay
to wear this jacket for a date.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.666
Don't you feel it's a bit awkward?

47:39.666 --> 47:41.083
Pan, this jacket is a bit big.

47:43.458 --> 47:44.958
Although it is quite cool.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.666
- Pan, say something.
- Show some team spirit, will you?

47:56.708 --> 47:57.708
Hey.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.208
I do have team spirit.

48:00.541 --> 48:01.625
That's a limited edition.

48:04.916 --> 48:05.916
Limited edition?

48:06.666 --> 48:07.666
Hm.

48:25.750 --> 48:28.541
You agreed to see me
so I could check the generator?

48:28.791 --> 48:30.208
What do you think I meant?

48:30.333 --> 48:31.333
Nothing.

48:31.666 --> 48:32.791
I didn't think anything.

48:39.916 --> 48:41.291
Can you pass me the toolbox?

48:56.333 --> 48:57.333
Thank you.

48:58.041 --> 48:59.250
The generator's not working?

48:59.958 --> 49:01.708
Nothing seems wrong with it.

49:02.458 --> 49:04.208
But the energy output has decreased.

49:04.583 --> 49:05.703
There's a jump in frequency.

49:06.541 --> 49:09.333
I'll split the module areas
of the generator and test it again.

49:09.416 --> 49:11.416
It needs at least 20 minutes.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.708
How about this?

49:13.791 --> 49:15.541
Why don't we talk for a bit?

49:19.541 --> 49:23.000
We've never really talked before.

49:26.375 --> 49:27.708
Is Yang Jiannan your schoolmate?

49:28.750 --> 49:29.750
Yes.

49:30.750 --> 49:31.958
Pan from your team, too.

49:33.958 --> 49:35.541
The day we graduated,

49:36.333 --> 49:37.916
we were all full of ambition.

49:39.250 --> 49:40.458
But the mother ship came.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.125
To defend against the aliens,

49:43.208 --> 49:44.750
we've all become soldiers.

49:46.416 --> 49:48.000
It was during that time that I realized

49:48.083 --> 49:50.958
that love, your family, your dreams...

49:51.041 --> 49:52.916
They all seem insignificant
in the face of war.

49:53.875 --> 49:56.708
Before we win, it is impossible

49:56.875 --> 49:59.666
for us to have any of those things
in our lives.

50:02.958 --> 50:06.500
When I was young,
I envied other kids' fathers.

50:08.208 --> 50:09.625
My father was a soldier.

50:10.250 --> 50:11.250
He was always so cold.

50:12.666 --> 50:14.041
I've never seen his smile.

50:15.208 --> 50:16.791
My mom said I didn't understand him.

50:21.208 --> 50:22.608
In the end, he sacrificed his life.

50:24.375 --> 50:25.935
I regret that I never got the chance...

50:27.166 --> 50:28.833
I never got the chance to tell him...

50:33.791 --> 50:34.958
After joining the army,

50:36.958 --> 50:38.291
I finally understood him.

51:00.166 --> 51:01.333
<i>That day, she told me</i>

51:01.875 --> 51:04.333
<i>she hoped children in the future
could one day look to the sky</i>

51:05.000 --> 51:07.333
<i>and not see the purple dahlias anymore.</i>

51:08.750 --> 51:10.000
<i>That these dahlias</i>

51:10.916 --> 51:12.416
<i>would only stay in our memory.</i>

51:16.916 --> 51:18.500
<i>When I was closest to her,</i>

51:19.666 --> 51:21.346
<i>I still couldn't say what I wanted to say.</i>

51:36.833 --> 51:39.041
<i>Lately, cracks have appeared
all over Shanghai.</i>

51:39.208 --> 51:40.375
<i>I am currently at</i>

51:40.458 --> 51:42.476
<i>the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition
and Convention Center.</i>

51:42.500 --> 51:44.000
<i>The crack behind me</i>

51:44.166 --> 51:46.333
<i>suddenly appeared this morning,
at around 5:00 a.m.</i>

51:46.416 --> 51:49.708
<i>The real cause behind these cracks
is not yet known.</i>

51:50.291 --> 51:51.291
How could this be?

51:52.083 --> 51:53.791
In my previous reports,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.083
I have mentioned this more than once.

51:57.083 --> 52:00.500
The energy supply of the Shield
fluctuated frequently.

52:04.083 --> 52:05.750
The launch of the Shanghai Cannon

52:05.833 --> 52:08.708
is likely to exacerbate
this fluctuation now.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.125
And the instability of the energy supply

52:11.208 --> 52:13.541
will cause the Shield to collapse
at any time,

52:13.625 --> 52:16.125
and then allow
the annihilators to penetrate.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.833
Once the defect becomes more serious,

52:18.916 --> 52:20.666
the Shield cannot be repaired anymore.

52:21.166 --> 52:23.750
The consequences could be disastrous.

52:23.958 --> 52:24.958
General Shao,

52:25.541 --> 52:27.583
the great cannon was strictly operated

52:27.666 --> 52:29.833
based on the data provided
from the previous tests.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.208
Firing the great cannon

52:31.291 --> 52:33.171
could not have caused
such violent fluctuations.

52:33.416 --> 52:36.125
We were operating
well within the safety parameters.

52:36.208 --> 52:39.291
So, I hope you can give me
a better explanation.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.791
Every time the cannon is fired,

52:42.458 --> 52:45.000
it damages the Shield's energy supply.

52:45.708 --> 52:48.208
Such damage is not temporary.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.333
- It's permanent.
- That's impossible!

52:51.208 --> 52:53.375
Yang Jiannan. Hold your temper.

52:54.208 --> 52:55.500
- Alert.
- Take a look at this.

52:55.583 --> 52:58.833
Alert! Zones D35,

52:59.291 --> 53:01.250
H18,

53:01.833 --> 53:06.833
and C9 have cracks
appearing on the Shield.

53:06.916 --> 53:08.375
Cracks are appearing on the Shield.

53:08.541 --> 53:10.041
- Predators!
- Zone D7 is defected!

53:10.125 --> 53:11.583
- Predators!
- 48 percent damage.

53:11.666 --> 53:12.866
- Invasion.
- Danger level, B+.

53:13.291 --> 53:14.791
Number 13 and 15 to command center.

53:14.875 --> 53:15.708
Restore it.

53:15.791 --> 53:16.831
- Understood.
- Understood.

53:17.291 --> 53:18.750
- D13 is cracked.
- Zone M.

53:18.833 --> 53:20.166
- Damage, 36 percent.
- 76 meters.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.693
- Class C hazard.
- A-grade damage.

53:21.750 --> 53:22.958
Number seven and nine, repair.

53:23.041 --> 53:23.875
Zone D.

53:23.958 --> 53:25.267
- Level three damage.
- A-level alert.

53:25.291 --> 53:27.451
- Zone D31 has a huge crack.
- It is rapidly expanding!

53:27.500 --> 53:29.083
- Number 4 to 11.
- Restore the energy.

53:29.166 --> 53:31.750
Concentrate the energy
for restoration to prevent intrusion.

53:32.041 --> 53:33.458
Restoration is underway.

53:36.416 --> 53:37.916
The Shield system is back to normal.

53:39.708 --> 53:41.666
- Launching defense.
- Backup energy completed.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Crisis averted.

53:53.083 --> 53:54.083
Good.

53:54.333 --> 53:55.416
Everyone, take a break.

54:13.541 --> 54:15.416
Hey. How is it? Everything okay?

54:15.500 --> 54:17.041
Wait a moment. I need to do a backup.

54:18.083 --> 54:20.666
Command center defense system
is showing abnormality.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.875
It needs three minutes to self-repair.

54:26.166 --> 54:28.041
Luckily,
the Shield was repaired just in time.

54:28.875 --> 54:30.500
My training finally paid off.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.458
Predator invasion! Look out!

54:59.500 --> 55:01.333
Jiang Yang, are you okay?

55:01.791 --> 55:03.333
It's trying to enter the control room.

55:09.541 --> 55:11.125
Don't let it go into the control room!

55:11.208 --> 55:12.208
Shoot!

55:16.750 --> 55:17.750
Faster, shoot!

55:18.083 --> 55:19.083
Stop it!

55:24.166 --> 55:25.208
Jiang Yang!

55:34.500 --> 55:36.458
Stop it!

55:37.875 --> 55:39.208
Hurry, shoot it!

55:46.166 --> 55:47.486
It's trying to remove the Shield.

55:49.541 --> 55:50.583
ALERT

55:51.166 --> 55:52.708
Destroy the server!

55:52.833 --> 55:53.833
Got it.

55:54.708 --> 55:55.583
Yiyi.

55:55.666 --> 55:56.666
Hurry!

55:59.125 --> 56:00.125
There's no time!

56:03.625 --> 56:04.708
Pan Hantian!

56:07.708 --> 56:08.916
Alert.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.875
The Shield has been forcefully removed.

56:13.416 --> 56:14.500
Alert.

56:14.916 --> 56:18.791
The Shield has been forcefully removed.

56:19.333 --> 56:20.333
What do we do?

56:24.333 --> 56:29.750
The control room will self-destruct.

56:29.833 --> 56:31.333
- Get out of here!
- Begin countdown.

56:31.416 --> 56:32.541
What are you waiting for?

56:33.833 --> 56:34.708
Pan Hantian!

56:34.791 --> 56:35.916
- Go!
- Pan Hantian!

56:36.583 --> 56:37.875
- Hantian...
- Let's go!

56:38.458 --> 56:39.458
Pan...

56:41.083 --> 56:42.708
- Let's go!
- Let me go!

56:44.833 --> 56:46.250
Pan Hantian!

56:48.375 --> 56:49.791
Pan Hantian!

56:50.500 --> 56:52.666
It's going to explode! Everyone, leave!

57:18.958 --> 57:23.750
Standby server is starting.

But Xianteng's energy levels

01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:52.708
are not high enough
to support the Shield system.

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:54.833
We must give up on Shanghai.

01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:57.291

We will not give up on Shanghai.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:02.833
I'll fight with the rest until the end.

01:01:04.541 --> 01:01:05.875
General Shao.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.291
All members of the Cannon Command
will not abandon their post.

01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:13.375
Council members,

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.625
according to the newly recovered data
on the New Delhi battle,

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.916
as well as the assessment
of the mother ship.

01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:25.208
I believe we have one more chance.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:28.416
So,

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:30.916
I have drawn up a battle plan.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.250
GLOBAL JOINT DEFENSE COMMITTEE

01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:55.500
Since Xianteng cannot support both
the shield and the cannon at once,

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.708
we decided to withdraw the Shield

01:01:57.916 --> 01:02:00.666
and transfer all energy
to the Shanghai Cannon.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:03.250
The moment the Shield is removed,

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:05.875
AV28 and all the drones under command

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:08.000
will be the aerial fortress of Shanghai.

01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:10.625
The simulation training was for this?

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.791
You must cooperate to defend Xianteng

01:02:13.875 --> 01:02:15.875
and, at the same time,
the Shanghai Cannon as well.

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.416
Fire at the right moment.

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.875
You can choose to leave.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.125
But if you choose to stay,

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:23.375
you have to figure out what this means.

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:26.958
Understand?

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:28.875
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:35.541
<i>Emergency notice.</i>

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.583
<i>Residents of Shanghai,</i>

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:39.208
<i>please get to
the specified location,</i>

01:02:39.291 --> 01:02:41.083
<i>according to the evacuation plan.</i>

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:42.750
<i>Evacuate in an orderly fashion.</i>

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.708
<i>Provinces and cities around Shanghai</i>

01:02:45.791 --> 01:02:47.041
<i>have assembled provisions</i>

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:49.375
<i>and preparations for full reception.</i>

01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:53.666
<i>You will be leaving this place
only temporarily.</i>

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.625
<i>We will return one day.</i>

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:45.875
You only have one chance.

01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:48.166
So the timing is crucial.

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:52.958
Chief,

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.791
I have read your battle plan.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.500
I think the best time for attack
is when the ship is retrieving Xianteng.

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.125
See you after our victory.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:11.583
Lin Ian.

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:13.541
- You wait here.
- Roger.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.000
What do you want me to do?

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.208
Once the Shield is disabled,

01:04:20.916 --> 01:04:22.666
the Predators will invade.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.791
To make sure that the plan succeeds,

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.891
I need you to be here and stay on guard.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:45.666
After an hour,
we will disable the Shield.

01:04:45.833 --> 01:04:47.625
Gray Eagle Squad,
carry out your mission now.

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.291
You need to prepare for the worst.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.416
You have five minutes.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.875
Leave all your belongings here.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:04:59.875
Inside this titanium alloy box,

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:02.666
there's a transmitter that
can last for 100 years.

01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:05.500
If people look for it in the future,
they're sure to find it.

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.083
You guys can leave

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:10.958
any personal items
you want inside this box.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.041
Let's begin.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:22.916
TO MOM AND DAD

01:05:45.125 --> 01:05:49.750
INBOX, LIN LAN SLEEP
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.440
<i>He's always wanted to give you this.</i>

01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.083
<i>I've heard that</i>

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.000
<i>when you love someone,</i>

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:13.751
<i>love as if there's five minutes left
in your life.</i>

01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:19.500
<i>What if we really have
only five minutes left?</i>

01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:32.833
RECIPIENT: LIN LAN LIN
LAN, I LOVE YOU

01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:37.333
SENDING

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:48.166
SENDING FAILED. THE SYSTEM
WILL AUTOMATICALLY RETRY

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.133
<i>I don't know
if she will receive this message.</i>

01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:52.666
<i>But I know</i>

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.041
<i>that this is my last chance.</i>

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:57.208
JIANG YANG, GRAY EAGLE SQUAD

01:06:58.791 --> 01:06:59.958
Gray Eagle Squad, Jiang Yang.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:01.166
Standing by.

01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:04.291
UNDC HGR-03

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:10.750
<i>Just like that,</i>

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:14.666
<i>We, the Gray Eagle Squad,
standing on the border of life and death,</i>

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:17.291
<i>took up the responsibility
to defend Shanghai.</i>

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:24.041
<i>When I sat in the AV28,</i>

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.791
<i>my heart felt surprisingly calm.</i>

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:29.291
<i>Whether it was Zeng Yu,</i>

01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:31.041
<i>Lu Yiyi,</i>

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:32.958
<i>or General Shao,</i>

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.583
<i>we decided to stay
with all of our comrades.</i>

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:38.434
- <i>We have decided to stay on...</i>
- Shanghai Cannon completed.

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:40.538
<i>To fight for Shanghai,
or go down with it if we fail.</i>

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:56.208
Hurry up!

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:02.041
<i>At that moment, I realized...</i>

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:04.666
<i>The one guarding Shanghai
was not the shield,</i>

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:06.833
<i>the cannon,</i>

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.083
<i>or Xianteng,</i>

01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.375
<i>or the AV28 or the drones we piloted.</i>

01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:17.741
<i>- The fortress was...</i>
- Salute!

01:08:19.207 --> 01:08:21.000
<i>The courage within all of us.</i>

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.207
Hurry,
let's get to the specified location.

01:08:56.457 --> 01:08:57.666
Zeng Yu, Lu Yiyi.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:58.875
Drones array.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.791
- Roger.
- Roger.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:25.332
The Shanghai Cannon is ready.

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:26.500
Yang Jiannan.

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:38.041
Abyss defense has been completed.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.541
Commander Lin Ian.

01:09:51.957 --> 01:09:53.291
Gray Eagle Squad is ready.

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:54.625
Commander Jiang Yang.

01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:02.125
All commanders,

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.458
transfer the Shield's energy
to the Shanghai Cannon.

01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:07.708
Once we disable the Shield,

01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:10.583
we'll become the main target
of the mother ship.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:12.416
Let's begin!

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.500
Start the energy transfer.

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:16.125
Target, Shanghai Cannon.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.291
Drones, fire!

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.208
Preparing to attack.

01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.708
Three, Two, One.

01:11:24.666 --> 01:11:25.666
Take position.

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.958
Transfer the command to the Abyss.

01:11:28.041 --> 01:11:29.083
Understood.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.083
Predators are breaking
our line of defense.

01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:43.833
Their target is the command center.

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:55.500
Chief, command transfer
to the Abyss completed.

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:57.875
Command Center,
I will come over to support.

01:11:58.416 --> 01:12:00.250
Gray Eagle, stick to your post.

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:06.500
Young fighters,

01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:09.000
I hope you all make it.

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:22.291
Gray Eagle Squad.
Predators are over Xianteng.

01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:24.208
Roger, returning to Xianteng's base.

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:34.333
Incoming Predators! Prepare for battle!

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.083
Prepare for battle!

01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:50.791
Gray Eagle.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.166
Predators are attacking
the outskirts of Xianteng.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:55.041
Roger that.
I'll head over to provide backup.

01:13:12.666 --> 01:13:14.750
Lu Yiyi, cover Xianteng's base.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Understood.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.708
The artillery has arrived at the base.

01:13:26.916 --> 01:13:29.041
Report.
Gray Eagle has arrived at Xianteng's base.

01:13:38.541 --> 01:13:40.333
Shanghai Cannon.
Report recharge progress.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.583
Shanghai Cannon.
Waiting for ship to be in position.

01:13:42.666 --> 01:13:43.916
Ready to attack any time.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.125
- Zeng Yu, protect the cannon.
- Roger.

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:03.625
First line of defense invaded.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.375
Preparing second line of defense.

01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:10.708
Shrink the defense circle.

01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:13.875
Limit defense circle.

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:14.958
Yiyi, be careful.

01:14:16.666 --> 01:14:18.791
Alert.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:21.541
Fuselage attacked.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:22.791
I can't get rid of it!

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.166
- Fuselage attacked.
- Turn right

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.791
at an 80-degree angle.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.708
Yiyi, roll your flight.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.833
Roger!

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:49.708
- Warning. Flight wing is damaged.
- Jiang Yang!

01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:53.250
Warning. Flight wing is damaged.

01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.083
Increase firepower.
Hold the line of defense.

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.791
Auto-repair failed.

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.333
Ejection capsule.

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:28.250
Auto-repair failed.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.166
Ejection capsule.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.333
Jiang Yang, report your situation.

01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:52.708
Jiang Yang, reporting at Xianteng's base.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.708
Zeng Yu, hold off the Predators.

01:16:16.166 --> 01:16:18.666
The mother ship
has not entered firing range.

01:16:18.958 --> 01:16:19.958
Leave it to me.

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:48.000
Damn it! These Predators are insane!

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:50.875
Calling!
The cannon needs support over the sky.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.708
You're the only one who can operate
many systems at the same time.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:55.583
Go support Zeng Yu.

01:17:55.666 --> 01:17:57.208
Calling, Zeng Yu calling!

01:17:58.625 --> 01:17:59.625
Hey.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.791
I can't leave you alone.

01:18:04.166 --> 01:18:06.333
On behalf of Pan Hantian,

01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:08.151
I order you to board the aircraft.

01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:46.291
Organizing third line of defense.

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:57.291
Shanghai Cannon. Mother ship descending.

01:18:57.916 --> 01:19:00.416
Get into the best firing position.
Prepare for countdown.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:01.583
Roger!

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.791
We must hang on until the cannon fire.

01:19:06.958 --> 01:19:08.500
Be sure to hold off the Predators.

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:24.583
<i>Yiyi, don't be scared.</i>

01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.208
<i>Shoot</i>

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:28.166
<i>while shouting a name you wish to call,</i>

01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:30.083
<i>it can erase your fear.</i>

01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:35.791
Pan Hantian.

01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:47.541
Lu Yiyi!

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:56.958
WARNING

01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:58.875
Come and get me!

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.583
This is for Lu Yiyi!

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.125
Zeng Yu, calm down.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.483
Lu Yiyi's sacrifice has to pay off.

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:18.833
Target has entered the firing range.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.416
Cannon is ready to fire.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.291
How can this be?

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:17.000
Predators have secured the target.

01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:18.333
Attack failed.

01:21:24.791 --> 01:21:27.000
This is Xianteng's minimum
energy security system.

01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:29.333
It is also our last resort.

01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:32.958
Release all energy
of Xianteng to obtain

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.541
our one last chance.

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:37.708
Ah.

01:21:40.916 --> 01:21:42.541
Rapid depletion of Xianteng's energy

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:45.958
will cause an annihilation effect
and make the land sink.

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:48.541
- Lin Ian.
- Seize this opportunity.

01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:54.083
Restarting system.

01:21:54.166 --> 01:21:55.625
Preparing to fire.

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:17.416
Don't let it enter the control room.

01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:41.708
The annihilators entered the Abyss.

By sacrificing this extraordinary city,

<i>commemorating the day
humanity defeated the alien mother ship,</i>

<i>which gave mankind the confidence

<i>People say</i>

01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:35.625
<i>the reason why a city is great</i>

01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:39.666
<i>is not just because of the tall buildings
and heavy traffic.</i>

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
<i>What makes a city great</i>

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:44.625
<i>is the people
who've lived and fought here,</i>

01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:47.666
<i>and their persistence and sacrifice.</i>

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:56.583
<i>That day, I returned to a familiar alley.</i>

01:29:58.125 --> 01:29:59.833
I heard
some of your things are still here.

01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:00.958
I'll help you get them.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Okay.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.083
<i>If there were no aliens,</i>

01:30:07.583 --> 01:30:08.791
<i>what would we be doing?</i>

01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:10.791
<i>I would build them a robot</i>

01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:12.166
<i>and show them I could be great!</i>

01:30:12.666 --> 01:30:15.208
<i>If I don't pass, then I'd get married
and live a simple life.</i>

01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.750
<i>And when the weather is good,</i>

01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:18.250
<i>I'd ride on a bike with my wife</i>

01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:19.916
<i>and go to the mountains.</i>

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.583
<i>I don't want to think too much.</i>

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:25.833
<i>I just want to become a commander soon.</i>

01:30:26.583 --> 01:30:27.875

01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:22.666
<i>All my past efforts...</i>

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.250
<i>How I wish she could see me now!</i>

01:31:27.458 --> 01:31:30.208
<i>Today, I've finally become someone
who can fight by her side.</i>

01:31:34.125 --> 01:31:35.250
<i>And yet she's gone.</i>
