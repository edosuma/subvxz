18:28.350 --> 18:29.015
I'm sorry, man.
I just couldn't let my students'

18:29.092 --> 18:30.350
experience not be heard.

18:30.426 --> 18:33.260
Yeah, well, the university
is incredibly disappointed

18:33.338 --> 18:35.355
that you went that route.

18:35.431 --> 18:36.448
Smart to have a kid
read it, though.

Yeah. They're not
gonna fire you.

18:42.030 --> 18:44.622
I mean, the response to
the speech was just so positive

18:44.699 --> 18:47.350
that they agreed
to look the other way.

18:47.352 --> 18:50.277
For real?
Yeah.

18:50.355 --> 18:52.021
Well, I'm glad that they,
uh, you know,

18:52.023 --> 18:52.872
decided to do that,
but I just --

18:52.949 --> 18:55.467
I don't think
I'm comfortable

18:55.543 --> 18:56.634
looking the other way
at this university anymore.

18:59.381 --> 19:02.623
So, what are you saying?

19:02.701 --> 19:03.641
I don't know. I guess
I'm saying, I think I'm --

I think I'm done.

19:06.872 --> 19:09.296
Well...

19:09.374 --> 19:10.648
I don't want to be
a grad student here anymore,

19:10.725 --> 19:14.652
and that means I have to quit
my T.A. job, too, so...

the university?

political thing

19:23.738 --> 19:25.646

and this university

are consistently
on two different pages.
