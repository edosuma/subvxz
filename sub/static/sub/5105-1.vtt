Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to Jackass!

03:33.640 --> 03:36.871
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm about to rent a car.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.950
- I have a reservation.
- I need a driver's licence and credit card.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.836
I need a signature here that you'll use
your coverage instead of ours.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.110
- Is that white one us?
- Yes.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.108
We're gonna walk around it
and inspect it together.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.871
Looks pretty good.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.799
I'm just looking
for dents and major scratches.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.232
- Ls not major, but I'll write it down.
- The little ding there?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.998
We'll take care of her.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.670
- Thank you.
- You have a good week.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.277
We'll be doing a lot of work here today.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.149
Trust us, we're gonna have fun.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.033
I'm Johnny Knoxville. This is called
the "Rent-a-car Crash-up Derby".

05:36.200 --> 05:37.758
Oh, fuck!

06:07.800 --> 06:09.199
Oh, fuck!

06:15.440 --> 06:17.556
We didn't reinforce the windshield.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.959
- That fucker missed me by that.
- Thas why you got the roll bars.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.713
Whose car is this?

06:33.920 --> 06:37.469
This is your guys' car.
I rented it from you earlier.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.158
- Yeah, I hit a dog.
- A dog, you call it.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.313
Come on in.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.592
I had an accident, as you can see.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.634
When I drink, I just black out.

06:54.840 --> 07:00.198
- Were you drinking?
- I had a little, to be honest.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.075
- Is there any licence plates on it?
- There was.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.556
Hopefully, you guys will incur
some of the cost,

07:07.760 --> 07:11.116
'cause I rented it from you guys
fair and square.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.993
I don't wanna get stuck with
the whole charge.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.156
You will get stuck with it.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.318
I don't think I should.
I think you should help.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.717
No. You declined
any additional coverage.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.480
Right there. You declined it.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.638
- Thas just paperwork.
- Ls a legal contract.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.913
I was... I had a few to drink
when I signed that, too.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.272
- We'll have to get this worked out.
- You'll have to pay for that car.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.119
- You have to help me.
- No, we don't...

07:40.320 --> 07:43.949
I returned it with a full tank of gas.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.196
You returned it demolished.

07:46.400 --> 07:50.109
- Ls got a full tank.
- Thas the least of our worries.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.757
This is an unmitigated outrage.
I've never seen anything like this.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.590
- What does that mean?
- No one's ever done that.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.672
- Well, I can't pay for it.
- You're gonna have to.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.314
Well, I ain't.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.399
I'll let you two work it out.
I'm gonna go outside,

08:13.600 --> 08:16.512
but that car
is gonna have to be paid for.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.111
F you!

09:10.920 --> 09:13.912
Knoxville knocked my nuts in half!

09:21.680 --> 09:24.274
This is "The Muscle Stimulator".

09:28.960 --> 09:30.552
It hurts my teeth.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.430
I can't even turn it off.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.276
How's that supposed to help?

09:44.480 --> 09:47.517
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.796
OK, I'm taking care of you.
Ls all right.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.389
Ls cool. You cool?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.478
Come on. Ease up. Daddy's got you.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.069
Daddy's got you. Come on.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.918
- You're gonna have tits of steel.
- You're so buff right now.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.837
This goes on the gooch!
This goes on the gooch.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.600
Who's gonna do the gooch?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.392
In case you didn't know,

10:18.600 --> 10:23.116
the gooch is the spot
between your balls and butthole.

10:39.080 --> 10:42.675
- Does it smell?
- Smell it. Just smell it!

10:42.880 --> 10:44.950
Ehren, smell it.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.234
- Zap my nuts.
- Les get it over with.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.352
- Are we ready?
- You're so gone.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.749
- He likes it.
- He liked it.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.516
Afternoon. How you doing?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.672
Son of a bitch!

11:38.880 --> 11:40.996
What happened?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.760
Man!

13:18.680 --> 13:21.353
Thas the best thing I've ever seen!

13:27.960 --> 13:29.996
Oh, fuck, dude!

13:47.160 --> 13:51.199
- Are you OK? Get over here!
- Help him, help him!

13:51.400 --> 13:55.188
- Medic!
- No! Don't move him!

13:56.760 --> 13:59.069
That had bad news written all over it.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.432
- Thas the worst that could happen.
- Dunn can't drive for shit.

14:03.640 --> 14:08.395
I don't know what happened. We went
in the air. The next thing I know

14:08.600 --> 14:10.636
I'm just fucked.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.991
Dude, you were hauling so much ass.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.719
We're here in Tokyo,
and I feel like partying.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.156
Hi, I'm Party Boy.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.555
Can I try this?

14:28.760 --> 14:32.753
Here we go. Ls my party music.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.830
Like it?
That makes me want to party.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.112
I feel like partying right now.

15:53.960 --> 15:58.590
Thas what the big ones do.
Sometimes they take a while to...

15:58.800 --> 16:00.233
Fuck!

16:00.440 --> 16:04.194
Don't pull on it, man.
You can't pry his mouth open.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.996
Ls slowly getting weightless.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.431
- Is he opening?
- No, you're twisting him!

16:13.520 --> 16:17.433
Oh, fuck!
He's got my nipple, dude.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.030
- I know. Hang on.
- Hang on. Don't move.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.791
- You little bastard!
- Look at the teeth marks.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.396
Man...

16:41.840 --> 16:46.516
I am Bunny Lifeguard. Any alligators
try to ruin our swimming,

16:46.720 --> 16:49.996
I'll wrestle them down
and have my way with them.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.988
If he falls near an alligator
and it grabs hold of him,

16:54.200 --> 16:57.909
Steve-O will relax
and hope the alligator will release him.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.915
I'm Steve-O.
This is "Alligator Tightrope".

17:08.200 --> 17:11.714
- Oh, shit.
- There's no such thing as failure.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.797
He got it.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.992
One thing I know
is good tightrope-walking.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.556
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

17:25.079 --> 17:28.629
- Put the chicken on him!
- Yeah!

17:32.400 --> 17:35.597
- Oh, shit.
- There you go.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.836
- Keep going, Steve-O.
- Oh, shit!

17:50.960 --> 17:53.235
Keep your head up.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.718
- Stick the bones up your ass.
- Let them pull it out.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.912
Stay there, don't move!

18:30.920 --> 18:33.673
Don't look!

18:40.280 --> 18:41.633
Don't move!

18:54.080 --> 18:56.435
I ran straight into a crocodile.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.316
Oh, my God!

18:59.520 --> 19:03.069
- Why can't you walk on a tightrope?
- I don't know.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.396
I thought you'd do it.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.797
Yeah, I don't know, man.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.788
I'm sure I could learn,
but today was my first try.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.273
I'm Bam Margera,
and my parents are asleep.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.473
Ls 12.42, and Phil has to be
at work at five in the morning.

19:22.680 --> 19:28.232
He's trying to get a good nighs sleep,
and I'm gonna go wake his ass up.

20:13.040 --> 20:17.830
I'm dying. Holy shit!

20:18.320 --> 20:23.155
- Oh, my God. I don't believe this.
- Look at Phil's tummy.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.556
Phil, you got to be up
at five in the morning.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.830
Six o'clock I'll be at work.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.910
Here he comes.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.598
Christ, Bam!
I almost broke my leg getting out!

21:12.800 --> 21:16.236
There's shit all over!
How am I going to work now?

21:37.800 --> 21:39.995
That woman in the corner,
cold playin' the role

21:40.200 --> 21:42.509
Leave her ass in the corner
till her feet get cold

21:42.720 --> 21:45.109
Knowin' for a fact
that girl is whacked

21:45.320 --> 21:47.709
If you hold your hand out
she'll turn her back

21:47.920 --> 21:50.434
Better walk, don't talk
She's all pretend

21:50.640 --> 21:52.596
Can't be her friend
unless you spend

21:52.800 --> 21:57.078
Wall to wall, after all, get ready to throw
only money at the bitch

21:57.280 --> 22:00.397
'Cause she thinks she's so-phisticated

22:02.840 --> 22:05.638
So-phisticated

22:43.320 --> 22:45.675
What are you doing?

22:45.880 --> 22:50.317
I ought to arrest you with all that in
your clothes. Whas wrong with you?

22:50.520 --> 22:54.308
- What are you talking about?
- Get this out of your pocket!

22:54.520 --> 22:56.909
Thas all me.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.759
What is this bullshit?!

23:04.600 --> 23:08.070
- Those are my bananas.
- Don't come here no more!

23:08.280 --> 23:14.355
Get out, and take the other stuff
out of your pockets. Get it all out.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.279
- Thas how you treat an old man?
- Yeah, go.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.359
An old man that steals.
I can't believe it.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.390
What kind of games
are you playing? Get out!

23:30.520 --> 23:32.476
- Get out!
- Goddammit!

23:38.600 --> 23:40.830
What is wrong with you?!

23:41.040 --> 23:43.076
Get out!

23:50.120 --> 23:52.509
Quit playing!

23:56.000 --> 23:59.959
- I was Lon Chaney's lover!
- Go back and love him.

24:01.960 --> 24:06.192
We're gonna go to this hardware store
where they sell toilets.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.038
I'm gonna take a shit.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.949
I'm gonna shit my pants
before we get to that place.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.392
- Dave, fight it.
- No jokes. I just wanna hold it in.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.309
- Got to poo?
- Pretty much. Really bad.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.911
Do you wanna ruin everything?
I swear to God... ls a problem.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.351
Is this the worst
you've had to go boom-boom?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.437
No. I shit my pants at the fair.

24:30.640 --> 24:34.428
Dude, he's shitting right now!
Get out, get out!

24:41.320 --> 24:44.073
Get out of the fucking car!

24:46.720 --> 24:49.917
- What did I do?!
- Did you shit?

24:50.120 --> 24:55.433
Oh, shit!
I'm taking a cab back to the hotel.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.996
He just shat everywhere.

25:17.200 --> 25:23.275
- Whas wrong, man?
- I had to sit there while he shat.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.879
I need to go home right now.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.150
Ls on my hand.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.515
We have very...
What the hell are you doing?

26:05.720 --> 26:08.996
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.350
I'm almost done.

26:11.560 --> 26:15.075
I hope you aim to get that,
son of a bitch.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.556
You got to clean it out, pal.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.636
That is disgusting, man!

26:30.360 --> 26:33.796
What a fucking fruit loop!

26:37.120 --> 26:39.554
Want me to play back?

26:48.160 --> 26:49.559
What the fuck!

26:54.680 --> 26:58.389
- Got him!
- Turn around. Les see it.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.038
Thas a good one.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.675
I'm Ehren Mcghehey.
This is "The Mousetrap".

27:59.360 --> 28:01.271
All right!

28:05.080 --> 28:06.433
Come on.

28:07.760 --> 28:12.470
Thas enough! Time!

28:17.840 --> 28:20.673
The "Bungee Wedgie".

28:23.240 --> 28:26.073
- This isn't gonna work.
- It might.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.716
Whas gonna happen here?

28:31.920 --> 28:35.549
I don't know, but is not
whas gonna be intended.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.278
Raab's putting a bloody tampon on.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.756
Thas a Courtney Love-sized
Maxi Pad.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.076
This is worse than a hanging.

28:46.840 --> 28:50.355
I'm Raab Himself,
and I'm a complete fucking idiot.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.949
- We need another one.
- Do it again.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.829
Hey, I'm Raab Himself,
and this is "Bungee Wedgie".

29:26.400 --> 29:29.039
Is that your shitty ass?

29:29.240 --> 29:32.949
Look at the bloody, shitty underpants.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.754
I can't believe this!

29:41.560 --> 29:45.235
We're in the Valley today
to do our own riot control test.

29:45.440 --> 29:49.797
This is George Hruska. What do you
do and what are we doing here today?

29:50.000 --> 29:53.436
I'm Vice President of Operations
with ALS Technologies.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.714
We make less lethal ammunition.
We're a top US manufacturer.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.629
We're going to shoot you
with one of our projectiles.

30:02.840 --> 30:08.517
Ls called the Pen-Prevent.
Ls a 40-gram tail-stabilised bag.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.951
Lll be travelling
about 250 feet per second.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.957
Is that lethal?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.913
Ls considered less lethal.

30:17.360 --> 30:22.150
This morning I thought I was taking
the beanbag projectile in the chest,

30:22.360 --> 30:24.237
but George's company said no way.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.399
If it hits me in the heart,
I'm pretty much done with.

30:28.600 --> 30:33.754
We wanna take every precaution
necessary to protect your vital organs.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.918
- Are my intestines in that area?
- Think so.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.997
Awesome.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.431
Are you gonna take
some practice shots?

30:58.680 --> 31:01.478
This is nothing to mess around with.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.150
This is nothing for anybody
to throw in a 12-gauge shotgun

31:05.360 --> 31:07.669
and think they could take it.

31:07.880 --> 31:12.192
I'm doing this because I can do this
in a controlled state.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.717
Safety's off.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.395
Going hot.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.992
- That really hurt.
- It looked like it hurt.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.553
Oh, fuck!

31:58.760 --> 32:03.550
Did you see the way I caught
that beanbag with my stomach?

32:03.760 --> 32:07.719
Thas instinct. You can't teach that.

32:16.640 --> 32:22.590
It hurts so much going from
a prone position to standing.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.954
Ouch.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.073
Hi, I'm Wee Man,
and this is a big cone.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.836
Oh, my God! My brakes!

33:27.040 --> 33:28.951
Oh, shit!

33:29.160 --> 33:32.357
My brakes! My brakes!

33:32.560 --> 33:35.074
My brakes!

33:35.280 --> 33:37.953
Stop me! Stop me!

33:39.760 --> 33:42.593
Stop me!

33:44.680 --> 33:47.399
- You all right?
- That was so fast.

33:47.600 --> 33:52.116
- Did your brakes go out?
- Yes. That whole thing doesn't work.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.596
Will you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.670
I could sure go for
a Miller High Life.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.039
Oh, you're in so much trouble.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.313
Kick her ass!

34:46.880 --> 34:49.268
I'm about to get ass-kicked by a girl.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.233
Keep up the left!

35:39.120 --> 35:40.792
And the winner...

35:41.000 --> 35:44.788
...and still champion:
- Now pronounce her name!

35:46.240 --> 35:48.117
His bloody mouthpiece.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.756
My God, my jaw
is two inches to the left.

35:51.960 --> 35:56.078
I felt all right for a bit,
until she punched me in the nose.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.511
I knew she was fighting dirty.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.354
- "Tropical Pole Vaulting."
- One, two, three, four!

36:23.280 --> 36:27.239
- Go grab the dead kitty!
- I've been in there before. It sucks!

37:08.920 --> 37:11.354
Oh, God!

39:17.080 --> 39:18.957
We don't have
to bleep cuss words,

39:19.160 --> 39:24.109
so I promise I will get my mom to say
"fuck" by the end of this movie.

39:27.040 --> 39:30.430
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
We're about to test my rocket skates.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.911
Go.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.792
This is "Rocket Skates", take two.

39:59.840 --> 40:04.038
- This one will be more powerful.
- These are different rockets?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.912
No, there's more of them.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.031
- Oh, fuck!
- Whas wrong?

40:33.240 --> 40:37.950
I fell and busted my ass.
Thas whas fucking wrong.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.030
Thas it.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.595
No more rocket skates.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.713
God! This party sucks!

41:50.240 --> 41:54.995
- Hey, my man. Wasabi. Lots.
- Wasabi.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.832
Yeah!

41:58.040 --> 42:02.238
Today I'm gonna treat myself
to some wasabi snooters.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.720
Little circles.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.753
God! Chopsticks are so stupid!

42:20.360 --> 42:21.839
Pretty good line.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.516
More.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.313
Do another snooter.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.716
I need a pick-me-up.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.749
This is bullshit!

44:42.840 --> 44:45.638
Phil. Phil!

44:46.320 --> 44:49.517
Phil. Hey, Phil!

44:55.720 --> 44:58.314
Oh, my God.

44:59.080 --> 45:01.719
Is this thing real?!

45:02.760 --> 45:04.990
This alligator?!

45:05.200 --> 45:08.590
- What?
- Look! Over there in the corner.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.997
What is that?

45:13.200 --> 45:16.875
Where have you been?
Don't you even look?

45:19.240 --> 45:22.550
Oh, my God!
Ls moving. Oh, Phil!

45:22.760 --> 45:28.949
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Aren't you scared to death?!

45:31.640 --> 45:35.235
Ls so gross that is even on the floor.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.273
I'm going out. Where's my keys?

45:38.480 --> 45:41.790
That is the scariest fucking thing
I ever saw!

45:42.720 --> 45:45.439
Don't leave. Where are you going?

45:45.640 --> 45:50.589
Phil, help me get this thing
out of here! I'm scared to death!

45:53.920 --> 45:55.353
Oh, God!

46:01.040 --> 46:02.314
Oh, man!

46:02.520 --> 46:05.478
No, no! I don't want it open!

46:05.680 --> 46:09.229
No, no!
You don't have it, do you?

46:09.440 --> 46:11.795
- No, we don't.
- Ls not there?

46:12.000 --> 46:15.595
Seriously, is that real?
I'm serious. Is it real?

46:15.800 --> 46:18.758
- Is it real?!
- Yeah.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.599
I'm serious. I want it out!

46:29.400 --> 46:32.073
Dude, wait, stop, chill!

46:33.400 --> 46:36.517
Jason kicked your ass!

46:36.720 --> 46:40.235
- I didn't even get you.
- You got beat up by Wee Man.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.352
Let me see.
He didn't even get you.

46:43.560 --> 46:47.758
- Where?
- He didn't even get you.

46:47.960 --> 46:50.872
Let me see the back of your head.

46:51.080 --> 46:52.832
- Oh!
- Lll be all right.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.514
I'm here with Eric Koston
and Clyde Singleton.

46:57.720 --> 47:02.271
Today I'm gonna 50-50 this rail,
or try to.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.471
- This thing is long.
- Thanks.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.955
Thanks for reminding me.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.716
I got it. I got this.

47:16.920 --> 47:21.710
- Is he gonna go?
- He's gonna go somewhere.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.354
He's going, yeah.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.519
My impression of Johnny Knoxville.
Something like this.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.193
"Oh, my face!"

47:32.200 --> 47:36.398
I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm gonna grind this rail.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.788
Ready, set, go.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.958
He made it!
I can't believe he got that far.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.675
You ran it to the fucking bottom!

48:21.720 --> 48:27.317
This is the "Paper Cuts". I'm getting
paper cuts between my fingers and toes.

48:27.520 --> 48:32.799
There's no good way to do it.
Just deal with it. Take a breath.

48:41.320 --> 48:45.950
You can feel when it goes in. This
one works good. Give me the next.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.196
Do it.

48:51.600 --> 48:56.754
- Open up with a good one!
- Did you hear that?

48:56.960 --> 48:58.757
That was my flesh!

48:58.960 --> 49:01.713
If I do your hand,
you'll forget the pain in your foot.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.273
Good point.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.391
Take a deep breath.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.470
Hey, Lance, are you going to puke?

49:16.680 --> 49:18.238
He's gonna puke!

49:18.440 --> 49:22.479
From what, the pepperoni
or the paper cuts? Both?

49:22.680 --> 49:24.716
Pepperoni!

49:25.960 --> 49:28.190
- Pig entrails?
- Ls showtime!

49:36.240 --> 49:37.878
Is he OK?

49:38.080 --> 49:41.516
- Lance, are you all right?
- Don't knock over the beer.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.792
- Are you OK?
- No.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.749
There's green spit everywhere.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.032
Steve-O, if you wanna do
some more, do it. I'm done.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.310
Is everybody ready?

49:59.600 --> 50:01.716
That sucked!

50:02.760 --> 50:07.914
Am I glad I came down to see
what was going on in this room.

50:20.840 --> 50:23.718
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.480
Ls partying.

50:48.200 --> 50:51.237
This is "Sweaty Fat Fucks".

52:24.800 --> 52:27.268
Oh, honey. Ls been a while.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.119
- Ls a little too much.
- No.

52:34.320 --> 52:37.039
- You need to do it?
- You want a spot?

52:37.240 --> 52:40.038
- No, I got it.
- You got it?

52:40.240 --> 52:43.789
- You need a spot, give me a call.
- OK.

52:54.320 --> 52:57.073
Whas the quickest
you've knocked anyone out?

52:57.280 --> 53:01.671
I hold the California State record
of 18 seconds including the 10-count.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.390
I think you'll break that today.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.760
- I'm Johnny Knoxville.
- I'm Butterbean.

53:27.960 --> 53:31.839
Today we're gonna do a little boxing.

53:45.960 --> 53:49.111
Guys, touch gloves
and come out fighting.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.073
Get up!

54:05.960 --> 54:08.110
One more time.

54:08.320 --> 54:11.278
This is the last time
you're kicking my ass.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.552
More pain, thas it.

54:16.280 --> 54:19.397
Hit me once, at least. There you go.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.431
He's out.

54:42.640 --> 54:45.029
Is Butterbean OK?

54:55.000 --> 54:59.869
By knockout in the first round,
new champion: Butterbean.

55:00.600 --> 55:05.230
- Where are we going, Knoxville?
- The hospital.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.237
- Why?
- Don't know.

55:07.440 --> 55:11.797
Apparently, I have a gash in my head,
and I'm a little concussed.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.836
- Are you giving me a shot?
- Yeah. You OK?

55:18.040 --> 55:22.909
We got one more to go, buddy.
Then you are a free man.

55:23.120 --> 55:26.715
You're gonna be not feeling great
for the next 24 hours.

55:26.920 --> 55:32.438
Thank you, doctor. You'll probably
see me in two or three days.

55:33.520 --> 55:38.150
I, Sir Marcius, will never
pay you with cash, only with drugs!

55:43.440 --> 55:48.230
- Goddammit, what are you doing?
- Whas going on?

56:03.240 --> 56:08.712
We're in Okinawa and about to swim
with whale sharks, but first...

56:08.920 --> 56:11.798
...we need to go rub one out.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.796
I made the mistake of showing them

56:19.000 --> 56:22.675
what sea cucumbers do
when they're threatened.

56:22.880 --> 56:29.035
As soon as something touches them,
white threads come out of the end.

56:29.240 --> 56:33.233
Steve-O and Chris thought
it was a great idea,

56:33.440 --> 56:37.956
so they're out there
trying to masturbate.

56:38.160 --> 56:41.470
Anyway, I apologise for this.

56:45.080 --> 56:48.516
This is the "Whale Shark Gummer".

56:48.720 --> 56:53.157
With a simple shave with a razor,
Steve-O easily disguises himself

56:53.360 --> 56:58.036
to fool the whale sharks into
thinking he's a harmless young boy.

56:58.240 --> 57:01.630
I am nervous about my wiener
around that whale shark.

57:01.840 --> 57:05.992
The best way is to think
of whale sharks as big puppy dogs.

57:06.200 --> 57:10.512
- Sometimes puppies bite.
- They have little teeth.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.678
You're gonna get a gummer.

57:13.880 --> 57:17.156
- Ls like being with a gal with no teeth.
- Kind of.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.277
Below these waters,
30-foot whale sharks

57:21.480 --> 57:26.190
are waiting to eat these frigging
shrimp out of our crotches.

57:33.040 --> 57:36.555
They're kind of...
They pinch. Are these alive?

57:38.880 --> 57:42.839
They don't feel good
all the way to your cock.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.510
Look at this shrimp.

57:50.400 --> 57:54.552
I don't have any last words.
I'll kill myself once I lose my wiener.

58:46.120 --> 58:49.078
My penis is really small now.

58:50.680 --> 58:54.468
I can't really look cool right now.

59:00.200 --> 59:03.636
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the "Tidal Wave".

59:14.600 --> 59:16.397
- How did it look?
- Good.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.390
- Look at this guy.
- Great.

59:28.320 --> 59:34.509
I don't pick a tattoo unless I'm sure
people will laugh when they see it.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.519
Oh, my God, dude.

59:46.160 --> 59:51.757
How do you perform
the worlďs dumbest tattoo?

59:51.960 --> 59:55.555
Fuck, man.
At least I don't have to look at it.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.592
My name is Henry Rollins,
and this is "Off-road Tattoo"!

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.038
This is designed to fuck you up!

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.350
Christian motherfucker!

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.278
Ls a total smiley face, dude.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.432
- This fool got a haircut a week ago.
- You're about to get many more.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.795
Look at Ehren.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.953
Oh, shit!

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.074
We're finding it chilly in Japan,

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.239
so we're gonna warm ourselves up
with some fireworks.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.830
- Les go, dude.
- Roll back just a bit.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.715
Oh, no. This is a bad angle.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.350
An ember fell in my cornhole.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.158
Double-knot it, but gently.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.513
You may think this next stunt
is impossible.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.599
You got to squat a little.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.234
Every time...

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.318
Is Chris' dick shorter or...?

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.630
That almost hit Louis in the face!

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.310
Goddamn, this is
the "BMX Tug-of-war".

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.231
What a dumb-ass idea!

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.548
I'm surrounded by cacti,
for fuck's sake!

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.433
- Ls cacti!
- Cactus!

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.437
Whatever it is, it hurts!

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.429
You wanna get help across?

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.912
This is the "Yellow Snowcone".

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.636
Pack it in nice and tight.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.636
A little cold out here, it might
take a second. There we go.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.389
I'm not worried about the pee...

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.991
- You're missing the cone.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:05.830
You better eat that whole thing
and that spot, too.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.077
Enjoy the snow cone.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.350
You just wasted a whole bunch.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.270
Get that whole mouthful.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.040
- Keep going, eat it!
- Ls your pee!

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.959
- Come on!
- I'm trying. Ls so cold.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.836
- Swallow it.
- Oh, God!

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.277
- No puking.
- I'm doing it!

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.758
Ls dripping out the bottom. Catch it!

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.672
Oh, my God!

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.040
That was bad!

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.632
Kick yourself in the head, Wee Man.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.514
Are you starting to lose your mind?
You shit! Stop it!

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.076
Now you're getting crazy on this shit.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.397
Hey! He's starting to lose it!

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.839
Jesus Christ!

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.111
I need toilet paper!

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.989
This is called the "Golf Course Airhorn".
When people tee off

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.432
and are coming down with their swing,
we'll blow these airhorns.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.755
- Here she goes again.
- No? Is there another one?

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.951
She still hit it pretty good.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.750
- What did I tell you?
- You lost your club. Sorry.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.430
Didn't I tell you I'd come over
and kick your ass?

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.350
- Sorry, I've got bursitis.
- So you got to play with a horn?

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.154
- It helps.
- I'll give you something to play with.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.590
Sorry. It won't happen again.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.318
- Oh, fuck!
- He's teeing up.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:10.434
- Get back! Get down!
- Watch this. Wait.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.149
Oh, Jesus, you're scary!

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.069
- I'm Bam Margera.
- Johnny Knoxville.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.953
We're gonna be burglars today.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.238
Oh, God!

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:49.591
- Fuck! Get the diamonds!
- I told you not to fall off the beam!

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.553
Turn around! Fuck!

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.115
Holy fuck!

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.511
Idiot!

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.079
Holy fuck!

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.157
- You all right? You OK?
- I'm good.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.555
What did you think happened?

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.390
I wasn't halfway through the ceiling
and you were already out the door.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.909
You're an Olympic sprinter!

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.955
Dude, guys in masks, I'm out.
I don't quit!

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.475
Is there any actual real reason...

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.592
...one would shove this up their ass?
- No.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.588
- I'm claiming predictions for this event.
- Where's Ryan?

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.438
1: ls not getting in there.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.872
2: If it does, is not staying.
Definitely no sitting down.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.629
3: No way they'll believe this is true.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.308
So you're saying is...

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.149
There's nothing I want more
than for this to happen, but...

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.669
- You didn't want it that much.
- I really do.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.555
This is our original talent
for this piece, by the way.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.830
The first thing you've ducked out of.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:17.354
Man, I'm so glad
I turned this idea down.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.197
I'll probably use all of this
before the end of the segment.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.350
What else have we got?
A condom. Thank you.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.078
A little toy car. Blue.
Ls my favourite colour.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.037
Les see it dangling.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.999
Look at the reservoir tip.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.479
Now I'm lubing up the little toy car,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.195
because I'm going to put it in my butt.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.795
Be comfortable.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.869
Eďs here for rescuing, dude.
You're here for making it a problem.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.471
- You watching is uncomfortable.
- I got to get another job.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.958
- Lube up your cornhole.
- I am. I'm spackling.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.552
- Heart rate's going up, for sure.
- Adrenaline's flowing, isn't it?

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.751
It hurts like hell.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.873
Come on in, Manny.
You're just in time.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.993
Manny, tell me I'm a man.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.748
It feels so goddamn gross.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.635
This is insane. Ls totally insane.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.673
- Ls in.
- Ls in?

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.998
Oh, fuck!
I feel like I have to shit my ass!

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.112
Is there anything to tap?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.351
You said you didn't wanna do it
because your dad would disown you.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.155
- It wasn't that.
- You drank wine off a dude's ass crack!

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.273
But Dad never saw that.
I never told him that.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.835
I was gonna do this and I was like,

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.160
"Dad, we're going hard these days.
There's ideas floating around."

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.638
I mentioned the car in the butt,
and it was the only time in my life

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.154
I heard my dad say, "I'm not mad
at you, I'm just disappointed."

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.352
That hurt so much more.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.076
- Look at him walk.
- Dunn's gonna win, dude.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.796
I'm not too excited about this skit,
because there's a toy car in my butt,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.514
but this is the "Butt X-ray".

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.313
I think I need an X-ray.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.991
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.475
- I'm Ryan.
- What can I do for you?

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.797
I was partying last night
with some frat guys. I passed out.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.788
I must have broken something,
'cause I can't walk right.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.434
We're gonna take X-ray now.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.959
- This is comfy.
- Hold your breath.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.117
I can't tell you, he's there.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.679
- Whas that?
- No idea.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.236
Thas not part of you.
Thas something extra.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.116
- I woulďve known if I ate that.
- You wouldn't be able to swallow that.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.108
- That is a car toy.
- How did a car toy get there?

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.154
- Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
- I didn't do that.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.157
You ever seen anything like that?

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.999
I've never seen that in there.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.671
I'd say is a toy car.
Never in somebody's rectum.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.474
- You can't get it out?
- No.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.276
I'm a physician.
I practise this. X-ray only.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.392
You think I can just poop it out?

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.071
You won't be able to poop it out.
It will hurt you.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.239
I don't think is even good for you
that you poop it out.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.830
What will happen if he takes Ex-Lax?
Will that help?

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.352
No. He gets a lot of diarrhoea,
but no car.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.557
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:24.077
He's alive! Johnny Knoxville!
He made it!

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.919
There is a God!

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.476
At last, I thought it would never...

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.549
This is the end!
Thank you, Jesus!

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:48.669
Subtitle arrangement:
Plavi-G@Avgust 2003

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.590
Whose dick do I got to suck
to get some explosions?

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.394
Gator wrestling!

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.629
For fuck's sake, come here!
Hurry up!

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.876
Hurry!

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.399
We wanted to see if you would run.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.795
I ain't running anywhere.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.358
Scary enough to walk.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.596
You're nice. You're a good man.
Wanna come over for dinner?

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.758
Ls OK.
Do you know how to operate it now?

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.076
Yeah, I think so.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.669
I need help.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.633
The smiley face is a complete crucial...

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.430
- What did I say?
- "Fuck."

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.710
- I didn't say the F-word?
- You did.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:56.310
- Don't worry. We'll bleep it.
- Can we cut that out?

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.116
I think it says "fuck" on my forehead.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.709
- Did you know I had a tail?
- No.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.990
They must have taken it
from somewhere...

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.710
I can't believe you did that.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.480
Show him the X-ray.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.032
Trust me, dude. I'm not unimpressed.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.196
Oh, fuck!

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:06.238
The next time
we could do "Son of Jackass".

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.720
Yeah, dude!
