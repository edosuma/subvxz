00:53.378 --> 00:56.155
- Hi! Bye!
- Super late.

00:56.182 --> 00:57.718
Wait! I forgot
to make you lunch.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.196
- No, I have history!
- I gotta get a good seal.

01:00.219 --> 01:02.097
- You want history.
- Check this out!

01:02.122 --> 01:04.193
Ontario, where
General Vladekh Komenkho

01:04.224 --> 01:07.068
was caught hiding in what
appears to be pigs manure.

01:07.094 --> 01:08.198
Oh, that's gross!

01:08.228 --> 01:11.142
World's most feared tyrant,
in his day,

01:11.166 --> 01:12.668
as was his father.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.680
General Komenkho
vanished a decade ago

01:14.702 --> 01:17.478
during a global initiative
to end his reign of terror.

01:17.505 --> 01:19.281
- OK, gotta go!
- No, no! Lunch!

01:19.308 --> 01:20.719
Mom, you gotta
slop doing this, OK?

01:20.743 --> 01:22.848
I'm not a kid.
You're smothering me!

01:23.079 --> 01:24.387
Ta-la-la, la-la!

01:24.413 --> 01:26.290
Don't forget
to wear your helmet!

01:26.315 --> 01:28.125
- Yeah, yeah!
- Don't worry!

01:42.300 --> 01:45.510
The 3rd Canadian Division had
penetrated deeper into France

01:45.537 --> 01:48.518
than the British
or American troops

01:48.540 --> 01:52.318
and overcome greater resistance
than any other beachhead.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.154
Except Omaha Beach.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.218
Now turn to page 69.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.391
This is crossing
into creepy territory, Jake.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.864
- Oh, that's good!
- I gotta get that.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.899
Let me know when you start
collecting her fingernails

02:10.132 --> 02:11.577
and used tissues.

02:16.906 --> 02:19.318
So, instead of learning.

02:19.342 --> 02:24.189
Mr. Bouchard would rather draw
pretty pictures of fair damsels.

02:26.550 --> 02:30.657
Mr. Bouchard, me thinks
you would be better served

02:30.687 --> 02:33.760
taking notes
than sketching portraits.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.600
Me thinks old people

02:35.627 --> 02:37.197
should be seen and not heard.

02:38.596 --> 02:41.702
- Mr. Bernstein?
- Sir, yes, sir!

02:42.902 --> 02:46.406
I asked my mom to give me
a note to skip this class.

02:46.438 --> 02:49.351
But; "No! Exercise
is good for you!

02:49.375 --> 02:51.287
"It'll help build
your muscles."

02:51.311 --> 02:52.483
What muscles?

02:52.512 --> 02:56.221
I have the muscles of a guy
who spent too much time...

02:56.249 --> 02:59.561
Whoa! 63.8 miles per hour!

02:59.587 --> 03:01.533
New high school record!

03:02.924 --> 03:06.428
Hello! Earth to Jake!

03:06.460 --> 03:08.907
Why don't you just put
us both out of our misery

03:08.931 --> 03:10.376
and ask Angie out?

03:10.399 --> 03:11.878
- Ask her out?
- What are you, nuts?

03:11.900 --> 03:14.904
I grew up with her.
I've known her since I was 4.

03:14.937 --> 03:16.315
Even better!

03:16.339 --> 03:17.943
It'd be like dating
your own sister.

03:17.974 --> 03:20.648
In not a creepy-dating-your-
own-sister kind of way.

03:20.677 --> 03:22.679
What? No! Forget it. I...

03:23.681 --> 03:26.287
I haven't talked
to her in years.

03:26.317 --> 03:28.456
She won't even...
notice me.

03:28.485 --> 03:30.522
You can start by
developing a personality.

03:30.554 --> 03:31.829
I have a personality.

03:31.856 --> 03:34.302
"Moody loner" is a red flag,
not a personality.

03:34.326 --> 03:35.566
Shut up!

03:35.594 --> 03:37.904
Craig's throwing this
huge party tonight!

03:37.929 --> 03:39.306
Ask her to go with you.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.277
No, I can't.

03:42.301 --> 03:43.837
Why not?

03:45.438 --> 03:46.883
That is why not.

03:46.906 --> 03:49.649
- Todd Tomzak.
- You guys ready?

03:49.676 --> 03:51.417
You ever see
that guy play football?

03:51.445 --> 03:53.721
He's like a human
killer machine.

03:55.449 --> 03:57.396
"Human Killer Machine"?

03:57.418 --> 03:58.795
That's a good name for a band.

04:02.457 --> 04:04.300
You see that?

04:05.361 --> 04:07.398
She cold-shouldered Todd!

04:15.972 --> 04:17.541
Jake?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.418
Hey, Angie!

04:20.442 --> 04:22.424
Oh, no, no, no!
Please, keep it!

04:22.446 --> 04:23.891
I'm not really hungry, so...

04:23.914 --> 04:27.452
Um. So. Earlier.
In Sterning's class.

04:27.485 --> 04:30.365
That was me, right,
in the... that picture?

04:30.389 --> 04:32.300
- Uh...
- You know what?

04:32.324 --> 04:36.363
It's funny that you act-ask me
that, actually, because, um...

04:37.396 --> 04:38.774
Yeah.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.811
Um. Can I see it?

04:41.834 --> 04:45.304
- Yeah, yeah!
- Uh, sorry. Um...

04:46.339 --> 04:47.978
Um, here.

04:49.510 --> 04:53.458
Wow! This is, um...
This is really good.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.892
You think so?

04:54.916 --> 04:56.361
Yeah. Can I keep this?

04:56.384 --> 04:58.489
Yeah, sure. Totally!

04:58.520 --> 05:01.865
Uh... You really
like that?

05:01.890 --> 05:04.838
- Well, I mean, it's...
- It's no Picasso, but...

05:04.860 --> 05:07.966
Well, that's because
all of your body parts

05:07.997 --> 05:09.374
are in the right place,

05:09.398 --> 05:10.968
or so I assume.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.537
- Uh...
- Um...

05:12.569 --> 05:13.673
Yeah.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.810
Uh, speaking of body pans
being in their right place,

05:16.840 --> 05:20.914
you probably shouldn't tell
Todd where you got that.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.518
- Todd? Oh, we broke up.
- Like, 2 weeks ago.

05:24.549 --> 05:26.756
Does he know that?

05:26.784 --> 05:29.925
Just because on the field
earlier, he seemed really...

05:29.955 --> 05:33.528
- Oh, um, yeah, you know.
- He's been trying to get me back,

05:33.559 --> 05:34.902
but I'm not interested.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.769
Really? Really...

05:41.835 --> 05:44.840
Angie, you know, uh, Craig is
having this big party tonight.

05:44.872 --> 05:46.749
And I know this is
really late notice,

05:46.774 --> 05:48.913
and I'm sure you have
plans with your peeps.

05:48.943 --> 05:50.547
'Cause you probably have peeps.

05:50.578 --> 05:51.818
But I was wondering if...

05:51.846 --> 05:53.588
Are you asking me out on a dale?

05:53.615 --> 05:55.561
- You're right.
- That was a stupid idea.

05:55.584 --> 05:58.588
Shouldn't have done it.
Why ruin our friendship, right?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.497
I mean, we haven't
really been friends

06:00.522 --> 06:01.900
since we were 4 years old.

06:01.924 --> 06:03.494
You're right.

06:03.526 --> 06:05.528
But something like
this could ruin it

06:05.561 --> 06:07.768
for, like, another
13 years, so, I...

06:07.797 --> 06:11.769
Um, how about you.
Uh, pick me up? 8:00?

06:13.070 --> 06:14.913
Wha... Really?

06:14.938 --> 06:17.977
Yeah, 8:00. Does that
work for you?

06:18.009 --> 06:20.615
Yeah. 8:00 is good.
8:00 works.

06:20.645 --> 06:22.522
OK. I Will
see you at 8:00.

06:22.547 --> 06:24.458
Yeah.

06:24.482 --> 06:26.793
Um, Picasso, you are
cute when you're confident.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.197
Uh... Confident. Got it!

06:29.422 --> 06:31.095
OK!

06:33.692 --> 06:37.800
- So, how did it go?
- Did she reject you?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.607
- What? I...
- She said yes, man.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.580
- I mean...
- You're kidding!

06:55.017 --> 06:57.930
I have brought peace to a nation

06:57.953 --> 06:59.934
that was racked by civil war.

06:59.956 --> 07:01.833
What can you about the
thousands of civilians

07:01.858 --> 07:03.929
that you had executed?

07:03.960 --> 07:07.498
- It is a lie. That is a lie!
- All of that is a lie!

07:07.530 --> 07:09.511
AH of you, that is a He!

07:09.533 --> 07:11.513
Your accusations... Ah! Uh...

07:11.535 --> 07:13.606
Mr. Komenkho,
are you all right?

07:13.637 --> 07:14.707
Â» It's a heart attack!

07:14.738 --> 07:17.481
- Jakey, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me!

07:17.509 --> 07:18.886
It looks like Ge-

07:18.910 --> 07:21.823
- I've been home for an hour!
Where have you been?

07:21.847 --> 07:24.556
- Sorry, I was getting ready.
- What do you think?

07:24.584 --> 07:26.723
- Very handsome.
- Thank you for remembering.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.823
- Remembering what?
- About tonight.

07:29.822 --> 07:31.597
What are you talking about?

07:31.624 --> 07:33.502
Second and last Friday
of every month:

07:33.527 --> 07:34.699
dinner with Grandpa.

07:34.728 --> 07:36.730
- No. No, no, no.
- Not tonight.

07:36.763 --> 07:38.936
- Why not tonight?
- I have a date tonight.

07:38.966 --> 07:40.946
You can see Wendell
another time.

07:40.968 --> 07:43.609
- It's not with Wendell.
- It's with a girl!

07:43.638 --> 07:45.743
- Please don't laugh.
- Sorry.

07:45.773 --> 07:47.252
Seriously.
Who's it with?

07:47.275 --> 07:48.618
- You know her.
- Angie Wagner.

07:48.643 --> 07:51.648
- Little Angie Wagner?
- How is she?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.591
- She's a hard 10.
- That's how she is.

07:53.616 --> 07:55.186
And I'm like a soft 6.

07:55.217 --> 07:56.628
Seven.

07:56.652 --> 07:58.894
- If I blow her off.
- She'll never talk to me.

07:58.922 --> 08:01.664
Grandpa only gels out of
that awful old-folks home

08:01.691 --> 08:02.969
twice a month
for dinner with us.

08:02.993 --> 08:05.997
- We can do it tomorrow night.
- Any other night. Please!

08:06.030 --> 08:08.203
No, no, no! Twice
a month. No canceling.

08:08.232 --> 08:11.213
Old people need consistency.
Otherwise they get confused.

08:11.235 --> 08:13.943
- He's already confused.
- He thinks he's being watched.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.919
Being in the armed forces
has made Grandpa a little...

08:16.942 --> 08:19.923
- Crazy?
- Jake Bouchard!

08:20.946 --> 08:24.326
You can see little
Angie Wagner afterwards.

08:25.952 --> 08:27.625
Your dad's here with Grandpa.

08:27.654 --> 08:30.032
- Yay!
- Be nice.

08:30.056 --> 08:33.038
So, what tall tales is Grandpa
gonna tell us tonight, huh?

08:33.059 --> 08:35.336
Nazi zombies?
Communist garden gnomes?

08:35.563 --> 08:38.009
They were suspicious-looking
garden gnomes.

08:38.032 --> 08:40.876
- Yeah, 'cause in this house.
- That's totally normal.

08:45.941 --> 08:48.047
Hey, Dad, what's Grandpa doing?

08:48.077 --> 08:50.785
Oh, you know, there is
a van parked by the Grossbergs,

08:50.813 --> 08:52.190
and he won't get out of the car

08:52.214 --> 08:54.194
because he thinks
it's a surveillance van.

08:54.216 --> 08:58.131
Are the Grossbergs
having a circumcision?

08:58.155 --> 09:00.965
Jake, cover the TV, oh,
and the... the... the blinds.

09:00.991 --> 09:02.231
- Blinds.
- Blinds.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.900
I can't
Believe we still do this.

09:19.812 --> 09:21.759
- The televisions are covered?
- They sure are!

09:21.781 --> 09:23.727
- The one in the kitchen too?
- Yep!

09:23.750 --> 09:24.922
Well...

09:24.951 --> 09:27.363
That, uh, surveillance
truck finally moved.

09:27.387 --> 09:28.764
Yeah, of course, Dad.

09:28.788 --> 09:30.735
Hi. Son!

09:30.758 --> 09:32.999
Hi!

09:33.027 --> 09:34.700
- Let's eat.
- Let's do it!

09:34.729 --> 09:36.333
OK...

09:36.364 --> 09:41.280
Are you enjoying
your chicken, Dad?

09:41.303 --> 09:42.748
Yes.

09:42.771 --> 09:43.841
OK.

09:43.872 --> 09:46.149
Did I ever tell you
that Sanders, right.

09:46.175 --> 09:47.882
He was the worst cook
our unit had.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.753
You knew Colonel
Sanders, Grandpa?

09:49.779 --> 09:51.156
Are you kidding?

09:51.180 --> 09:53.751
You know, during the
Second Occupation of Cuba,

09:53.783 --> 09:56.390
Private Sanders, he used to
shovel mule poop, right?

09:56.420 --> 10:00.732
So, there was no, "Finger
lickin' good," you know?

10:00.758 --> 10:01.828
Trust me!

10:01.859 --> 10:05.330
And, um, basically.
I kind of invented the style

10:05.363 --> 10:07.400
of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.809
Hmm! Here we go...

10:08.833 --> 10:09.868
Me and my men...

10:09.901 --> 10:11.745
Not my men.
A special unit I had.

10:11.771 --> 10:13.341
We called them
Devil's Scum, right?

10:13.372 --> 10:15.943
We decided we were gonna
ambush this supply truck.

10:15.975 --> 10:17.921
It was right off
the coast of, uh, Cuba.

10:17.943 --> 10:19.423
It was right off
the shores there.

10:19.446 --> 10:22.290
So, we go hi! It.
Right? Nothing in it.

10:22.315 --> 10:23.953
But the cab was
full of chickens.

10:23.984 --> 10:25.327
We're starving to death, right?

10:25.352 --> 10:28.129
So, I tell Sanders;
"Hey, get that spice rack!"

10:28.156 --> 10:30.067
I said: "Throw them
in there," right?

10:30.091 --> 10:33.095
So 13 spices
and, uh, herbs later.

10:33.127 --> 10:35.734
History was being cooked!

10:35.764 --> 10:36.902
Hmm...

10:36.932 --> 10:38.240
You know, on the box here.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.213
It says 11 secret
herbs and spices.

10:40.235 --> 10:42.772
- Jake...
- No, he is correct.

10:42.805 --> 10:46.879
Sanders took out one herb
and one spice, so that's 11.

10:46.910 --> 10:49.390
And that's why I don't get one
royalty out of the whole deal.

10:49.412 --> 10:50.482
You know what?

10:50.714 --> 10:52.125
Can we spend a little
more time eating

10:52.148 --> 10:54.095
and a little less time
in fantasy land?

10:54.118 --> 10:56.291
Jake Michael Bouchard! Shh!

10:57.855 --> 10:58.890
I'm sorry, Dad.

10:58.923 --> 11:02.872
Jake's anxious because
he has a dale tonight.

11:02.894 --> 11:04.771
- Oh.
- Really?

11:04.796 --> 11:06.366
Like, with a girl, or...

11:06.398 --> 11:07.308
Why is that so...

11:07.332 --> 11:09.836
Hatch yourself
a little hot chick?

11:09.869 --> 11:10.973
Yes, actually.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.914
- Anxious to get out...
- Mom!

11:12.939 --> 11:14.919
- Dad...
- OK. All right.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.012
Listen. You have
some protection?

11:17.043 --> 11:18.318
- ' Mom!
- Dad!

11:18.345 --> 11:19.456
- What the heck!
- What's the matter?

11:19.480 --> 11:20.925
What? Are you ashamed?

11:20.948 --> 11:23.292
Is there something
to be ashamed about that?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.365
Well, that was awful.

11:27.388 --> 11:28.924
Mom, he's nuts!

11:28.957 --> 11:30.937
He lives in a fantasy
world, and you guys...

11:30.959 --> 11:32.097
He's doing it again!

11:32.127 --> 11:34.130
He thinks the house
is full of microphones.

11:34.163 --> 11:36.439
He's pulling XS all over
the wall. It looks awful!

11:36.465 --> 11:38.945
I expect you to
offer him a full apology

11:38.968 --> 11:40.914
when you drive him
to the nursing home.

11:40.936 --> 11:42.541
- Drive him? No.
- I'm not doing that.

11:42.773 --> 11:43.877
I gotta take Angie!

11:43.907 --> 11:45.944
Your dad and I
are going to the airport.

11:45.976 --> 11:47.978
I still have a
million things to pack.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.355
He's gonna ruin my dale
before it even starts!

11:50.380 --> 11:52.122
You're the only one
who can do it.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.391
And you know your
grandpa won't take a taxi.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.897
Could we FedEx him?

11:57.922 --> 11:59.459
Look, Angie.
I am so sorry.

11:59.491 --> 12:02.301
I had no idea this
was happening tonight.

12:02.327 --> 12:03.533
It's fine.

12:03.562 --> 12:05.473
It's nice that you
and your grandpa are close.

12:05.497 --> 12:07.842
Are you sure you're OK
to get to the party?

12:07.867 --> 12:10.905
- Yes, totally! It's fine.
- I'll meet you there.

12:10.937 --> 12:13.884
OK, great! Hey, try not to
have too much fun without me.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.912
- OK. Well.
- No promises. Picasso.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.480
OK, bye.

12:22.316 --> 12:25.196
Hey, Grandpa, I just
wanted to, um, apologize

12:25.220 --> 12:27.359
for what happened at dinner.

12:27.389 --> 12:30.393
Tonight means a lot
to me, and I, uh...

12:30.425 --> 12:32.929
I didn't mean to dis you...
Disrespect you.

12:34.263 --> 12:36.265
- We getting hi!
- Or something?

12:36.299 --> 12:37.471
Hello?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.208
- Hey, Picasso!
- Guess what? My ride died on me.

12:40.236 --> 12:42.148
It's leaking oil or something.

12:42.172 --> 12:44.345
Yeah? Are you, uh, you OK?

12:44.374 --> 12:48.220
Uh, yeah. I took a shortcut
and ended up on Rambler Street,

12:48.245 --> 12:51.591
right in front of the old
abandoned sock factory, so...

12:51.616 --> 12:54.426
Not the best neighbourhood
to be stuck in.

12:54.452 --> 12:56.227
Can you, uh, pick me up?

12:56.254 --> 12:59.031
Um... You know what?

12:59.058 --> 13:01.060
I actually still have to
drop my grandfather off.

13:01.093 --> 13:03.972
Could you give me.
Like, uh, 30 minutes?

13:03.996 --> 13:06.500
- I can call Todd.
- He's got a full set of tools.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.240
- No! No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

13:08.268 --> 13:10.077
I'll, uh...
I'll be there.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.639
Just, um...
Just don't move.

13:18.913 --> 13:22.020
- Ah, that's my boy!
- Battle of the Bulge, huh?

13:22.050 --> 13:24.155
- Mmm... OK.
- You know what, Grandpa?

13:24.186 --> 13:26.427
When Angie gels in the car.

13:26.455 --> 13:28.264
I need you to
just not talk. OK?

13:28.290 --> 13:30.965
I just need you to be
my normal grandfather,

13:30.994 --> 13:34.498
like everybody else's
normal grandfather.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.532
Just for, like.
A few minutes. Please.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.036
Grandpa, do you hear me?

13:39.069 --> 13:43.415
- Uh, yeah, normal, uh...
- normal grandfather.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.250
International reaction
to Krakhovian warlord

13:46.277 --> 13:49.054
Vladekh Komenkho's
sudden death is mixed.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.354
French president Jacques Dum...

13:50.382 --> 13:53.693
- Komenkho, man.
- I knew his father.

13:53.919 --> 13:55.096
He was a terrible dresser. Man.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.624
But he had some
nice teeth, but, you know...

14:03.362 --> 14:05.172
This is where she said she was.

14:05.198 --> 14:07.303
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.541
Yeah, there's
the old sock factory.

14:09.569 --> 14:11.674
OK, let me call her.

14:17.178 --> 14:18.714
What are you...

14:18.947 --> 14:21.019
Oh God!

14:35.465 --> 14:37.139
This her phone?

14:37.168 --> 14:38.442
Yeah, it is.

14:38.469 --> 14:40.574
Hmm... She must have
called the Auto Club.

14:40.604 --> 14:43.517
And then dropped it somehow
when they picked her up.

14:45.143 --> 14:46.622
Yeah, here.

14:47.646 --> 14:50.058
Hmm. Perfume...

14:52.684 --> 14:54.460
gasoline...

14:58.091 --> 14:59.627
and manure.

14:59.659 --> 15:03.039
What does manure
have to do with finding...

15:09.703 --> 15:12.742
What are you doing?

15:12.774 --> 15:14.276
Looking for footprints.

15:14.309 --> 15:16.516
Ah, there's more
than one of them too.

15:16.544 --> 15:18.148
That's not good.

15:18.179 --> 15:20.490
What is that stuff?

15:21.417 --> 15:24.626
It's called luminol, kid.

15:29.126 --> 15:32.596
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

15:32.629 --> 15:34.199
Grand...

15:42.273 --> 15:44.515
Grandpa!

15:44.543 --> 15:45.681
Over here!

15:45.711 --> 15:47.691
Crazy old man.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.694
Hey! What are
you doing?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.220
You can't just wander off
like that, all right?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.199
What are these
lire tracks doing here?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.463
Who cares?

15:57.490 --> 16:00.131
These are Goodyear EV330s.

16:00.161 --> 16:02.664
Issued to government
vehicles only!

16:02.696 --> 16:05.233
The same ones were
on the ambulance

16:05.266 --> 16:07.678
and the SUV that
passed us earlier.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.115
- OK. So, they're EV 30...
- whatever's. Can we go now?

16:11.139 --> 16:13.346
I think your girlfriend
got herself mixed up

16:13.375 --> 16:14.547
in something really bad.

16:14.576 --> 16:17.285
- For the last time, Grandpa...
- Really bad.

16:17.313 --> 16:19.156
She's not my girlfriend.

16:19.182 --> 16:21.287
And if I don't
get to that party,

16:21.317 --> 16:23.297
she never will be, OK?

16:23.319 --> 16:25.197
OK...

16:25.222 --> 16:27.224
- What are you doing?
- Calling Wendell.

16:27.257 --> 16:30.136
He's at the party. He's gonna
tell me that Angie is there.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.108
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Wait a minute.

16:33.131 --> 16:34.269
I'll tell you what:

16:34.299 --> 16:35.642
If she is at the party,

16:35.667 --> 16:38.648
you take me to the home.
Feed me a tuna-fish sandwich.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.843
Pa! Me on the head.
And we're done!

16:40.872 --> 16:45.151
If she's not there.
We do things my way.

16:46.745 --> 16:48.486
Deal?

16:52.619 --> 16:54.189
Fine.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.201
Not fine, "deal."

16:56.223 --> 16:57.793
Deal.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.201
Yellow!

17:06.233 --> 17:08.909
Wendell! Are you at
the party? Is Angie there?

17:09.137 --> 17:11.378
- No, she isn't.
- Craig's folks didn't leave town.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.851
Party's cancelled.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.548
What, are you
serious? Wha...

17:14.576 --> 17:16.614
Do you... do you know
where she could be?

17:16.646 --> 17:18.626
I've got more
important things to do

17:18.647 --> 17:21.253
than survey the whereabouts
of your girlfriend.

17:21.284 --> 17:22.786
She's not my
girlfriend, man, OK?

17:22.819 --> 17:24.196
I'll (ilk to you later.

17:25.321 --> 17:26.892
Let's go!

17:30.394 --> 17:32.739
Where are we? And what
are we doing here?

17:32.764 --> 17:34.710
It's an underground arms dealer.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.474
These guys may
help us figure out

17:36.501 --> 17:38.310
where they took your girlfriend.

17:38.336 --> 17:40.317
Yep, whatever you say, Grandpa.

17:41.807 --> 17:43.844
You know what this is?

17:43.876 --> 17:47.483
This is a spent shell from
a Tokarev automatic handgun.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.255
Where'd you get that?

17:49.283 --> 17:52.730
- The ambulance lire tracks.
- We're right there. Let's go.

18:05.267 --> 18:07.406
What's the password?

18:07.436 --> 18:09.473
The moon landing was a fake.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.803
Automatics on this side.

18:28.826 --> 18:30.864
Pack 'em up over there!

18:33.365 --> 18:35.470
OK, close this one up.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.774
Don't touch that, kid.

18:39.806 --> 18:42.412
Those are MID 69 super-EX mines.

18:42.442 --> 18:44.854
Unless you'd like to be
barbecued to a crisp.

18:44.877 --> 18:46.448
Boom!

18:52.753 --> 18:54.323
Come in!

19:01.663 --> 19:03.268
Have a seal.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.677
Thank you.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.981
So, what can I do for you?

19:15.045 --> 19:16.422
Um...

19:16.446 --> 19:18.653
You ever seen
any of these before?

19:20.351 --> 19:21.523
You a cop?

19:21.552 --> 19:23.395
Uh, military intelligence.

19:23.421 --> 19:25.833
- Your kid?
- Grandson.

19:25.857 --> 19:27.302
Hello!

19:29.561 --> 19:31.802
Let me see that.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.411
Tokarev, 7.6 mm.

19:35.434 --> 19:37.506
Hmm. Nothing new.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.448
Did you unload
any of those lately?

19:39.472 --> 19:41.418
What's it to you?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.512
- Well, you see.
- My grandson here.

19:43.543 --> 19:46.024
His, uh, girlfriend
got kidnapped

19:46.047 --> 19:48.687
and, uh, I found that
right at the place

19:48.716 --> 19:50.593
where we believe she got taken.

19:50.618 --> 19:52.826
And why should I care?

19:52.854 --> 19:57.325
Well, because in
about 10 seconds.

19:57.359 --> 20:01.604
I'm gonna take down
this big gorilla of yours,

20:01.631 --> 20:05.875
put the other goon away
and put this one in a coma.

20:05.902 --> 20:09.373
Then when I ask you
the question again.

20:09.406 --> 20:10.578
You'll be in a world of hurt.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.654
You know what I think?

20:22.687 --> 20:23.757
No.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.495
I think you should play nice

20:25.523 --> 20:27.800
and go home with your grandson.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.807
Grandpa?

20:31.430 --> 20:33.535
OK.

20:36.002 --> 20:39.472
See, I'll be! That
you're thinking:

20:39.506 --> 20:42.454
"Who is this old man
standing in from of me

20:42.477 --> 20:44.150
'Who's not afraid?"

20:44.379 --> 20:45.414
Am I right?

20:46.748 --> 20:47.988
And you're also thinking.

20:48.015 --> 20:51.520
"What does this guy know
that makes him so fearless?

20:51.553 --> 20:52.463
"He's crazy," right?

20:52.488 --> 20:56.527
That's what most people
think: "He's crazy!"

20:56.558 --> 20:59.699
But then again.

20:59.729 --> 21:02.471
Maybe he's not so crazy.

21:02.499 --> 21:06.709
Maybe he knows exactly...

21:07.538 --> 21:09.142
what he's doing.

21:09.173 --> 21:10.948
All right, enough.

21:14.145 --> 21:15.453
- Ah!
- Holy!

21:26.893 --> 21:29.567
- Help the boss!
- Come on!

21:29.595 --> 21:32.839
- Tell 'em to put them down.
- Put your guns down.

21:32.866 --> 21:34.743
Get up.

21:35.569 --> 21:37.480
On the ground, boys.

21:39.606 --> 21:41.143
Don't move anywhere.

21:42.210 --> 21:44.520
Come here.

21:44.546 --> 21:46.719
Now I'm gonna
ask you that question:

21:46.748 --> 21:48.990
Did you move any
of those shells lately?

21:49.018 --> 21:52.932
Um, just last week, buyers
from out of town wanted some.

21:52.955 --> 21:54.195
And?

21:54.223 --> 21:57.865
And they took full crates of
automatics and weapons and ammo.

21:57.894 --> 22:01.068
- You wouldn't happen to know.
- Uh, anybody's name, would you?

22:01.097 --> 22:05.706
No, uh, some mercenary
from "Krishkrash." I don't know.

22:05.736 --> 22:06.942
- Krakhovians?
- Yeah.

22:06.971 --> 22:08.473
- Komenkho.
- Mm-hmm.

22:08.506 --> 22:11.578
- The guy from the news?
- Son, you slay right behind me.

22:11.609 --> 22:15.114
Boys, face the
other way and walk.

22:18.684 --> 22:21.528
Don't look back.
Just keep walking.

22:22.555 --> 22:23.932
Come on.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.565
- Police! Everybody.
- Hands where we can see them!

22:30.598 --> 22:34.637
- Hands in the air!
- Hands in the air! Don't move!

22:34.668 --> 22:36.238
Sir, please
put your weapon down.

22:36.270 --> 22:41.084
- Leave those two alone!
- These... are "friendlies."

22:41.109 --> 22:43.555
Good evening.
Major Crawford.

22:43.578 --> 22:44.613
How you been?

22:44.646 --> 22:47.184
- Meh.
- Hey! You're the rabbi that...

22:47.216 --> 22:48.593
Mr. Bouchard...

22:48.618 --> 22:50.598
I'm Captain Steinberg
with ASPIC.

22:50.620 --> 22:55.194
Well, one might wonder
why we should find you here.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.636
This is very unexpected.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.162
I want to talk
to Maddy Harcourt.

22:58.195 --> 23:00.835
- Who's Harcourt?
- She's wailing for you.

23:00.864 --> 23:02.935
Please. Follow me.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.178
Come on. Let's
follow protocol.

23:24.257 --> 23:25.998
Take off the cuffs.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.077
Please leave us.

23:38.173 --> 23:39.345
Mr. Bouchard...

23:39.575 --> 23:41.953
Oh, please, call me
Jake, or Jakey.

23:41.977 --> 23:43.752
My grandpa calls me Jakey.

23:43.779 --> 23:46.260
Um, where is my grandfather?

23:46.282 --> 23:48.853
Don't worry,
Mr. Bouchard. He's close.

23:48.885 --> 23:51.729
I'm an old friend of his.
Madeleine Harcourt.

23:51.754 --> 23:53.701
Your grandfather and I
served together.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.227
Oh. Uh, were you
one of the Devil's Scum?

23:56.260 --> 23:58.706
Excuse me?

23:58.729 --> 24:00.072
The Devil's Scum.

24:00.097 --> 24:03.602
Uh, Grandpa's old
special forces unit.

24:03.635 --> 24:06.206
He told you he was
in a special forces unit?

24:06.237 --> 24:08.649
Oh, I... I won't,
like, say anything.

24:08.673 --> 24:11.348
I'll... I'll keep it
to myself, I promise. Shh!

24:11.377 --> 24:16.087
Uh, Mr. Bouchard, what else
did your grandfather tell you?

24:17.717 --> 24:19.698
Uh, where
do I start? Uh...

24:19.720 --> 24:22.633
Let's see... He told me
about North Korea.

24:22.656 --> 24:23.726
He told me about Mao

24:23.757 --> 24:27.137
and how that Argo movie
was all wrong or something.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.698
Uh, what are you guys
doing about Angie?

24:29.731 --> 24:30.732
Angie?

24:30.765 --> 24:32.039
Yeah, she's my...

24:32.066 --> 24:34.046
Uh, we were supposed
to pick up a girl.

24:34.068 --> 24:36.276
Her car broke down.
And then we got there.

24:36.305 --> 24:37.682
She wasn't.

24:37.706 --> 24:39.845
Grandpa thinks she's
mixed up in something.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.650
She was kidnapped.

24:42.878 --> 24:46.053
Mr. Bouchard, did your
grandfather ever mention to you

24:46.082 --> 24:49.063
that he received a Section B
from the military?

24:49.085 --> 24:51.122
Uh, I don't understand.

24:51.154 --> 24:52.964
Your grandfather hasn't been

24:52.990 --> 24:55.163
on the active-duty
roster since 2005.

24:55.192 --> 24:57.263
He was found
mentally incompetent.

24:57.294 --> 24:59.968
- But he's not ment-
- Perhaps it was stress.

24:59.997 --> 25:01.841
Maybe shell shock.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.869
We had him on desk duly
for a few years.

25:03.902 --> 25:07.816
But sometimes an idea pops into
his head and he runs with it

25:07.839 --> 25:10.719
without realizing
how insane the idea is.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.154
It's actually quite impressive

25:12.178 --> 25:15.091
how detailed the fantasy world
is he can create.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.322
- OK. But what about Angie?
- She's still missing.

25:17.351 --> 25:20.423
- You don't know where she is.
- Doesn't mean she's missing.

25:22.056 --> 25:25.003
We'll look into it.
I'm sure she's fine.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.733
- I... The... the...
- The shell casings!

25:26.761 --> 25:28.138
He found 2 shell casings

25:28.163 --> 25:30.006
at the place
she was supposed to be.

25:30.031 --> 25:33.878
Did you happen to see him
pick up those shell casings?

25:33.903 --> 25:35.075
Well. No.

25:35.104 --> 25:37.084
Part of your
grandfathers dementia

25:37.106 --> 25:40.315
is that he collects all sorts
of odd bits of military junk:

25:40.342 --> 25:44.314
spent shells, old scraps
of enemy uniforms...

25:44.347 --> 25:47.021
He's probably been carrying
those shell casings around

25:47.050 --> 25:48.825
for the last 20 years.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.837
So, he didn't lead
a raid on Mao's villa?

25:57.995 --> 25:59.942
The French Foreign Legion.

25:59.965 --> 26:02.241
The-the affair
with the double agent...

26:03.936 --> 26:05.415
All fantasies.

26:06.973 --> 26:08.850
Ah! I mean...

26:15.950 --> 26:17.486
Wait. No, no, no!

26:17.518 --> 26:18.895
He took down that big guy

26:18.919 --> 26:20.990
at the garage where
the rabbi picked us up.

26:21.021 --> 26:23.058
That guy was huge.
He used his bare hands.

26:23.090 --> 26:25.037
You should have seen it!
It was amazing!

26:25.060 --> 26:27.062
- Even old people.
- When they have to.

26:27.095 --> 26:30.804
When they need to, they can
turn it on for one last mission.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.376
I know this is hard for you.

26:33.402 --> 26:35.279
Your grandfather
loves you very much.

26:35.304 --> 26:37.375
But he can no longer
function by himself.

26:37.406 --> 26:40.479
Well, not until we get him
back on his medication.

26:42.780 --> 26:44.384
So, what happens to him?

26:44.414 --> 26:46.985
We're going to move him
to a veterans hospital.

26:47.017 --> 26:49.794
In a few months, you'll
be able to see him again.

26:50.989 --> 26:52.935
We've left word
for your parents.

26:52.957 --> 26:55.961
I'm sure once they get it,
they'll come straight back.

26:55.994 --> 26:57.975
Everything's going to be fine.

26:57.997 --> 27:00.034
Yeah, sure.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.952
Take good care of him.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.579
Mr. Bouchard...

27:18.886 --> 27:21.059
Hey! Hey, you guys, in there!

27:21.088 --> 27:23.501
Hey! Look at me!
Look at me!

27:23.525 --> 27:25.129
I am not moving. OK?

27:25.160 --> 27:28.004
You get Madeleine Harcourt
to come in here.

27:28.030 --> 27:29.977
I am not moving!

27:29.999 --> 27:31.376
Take a look right here.

27:31.401 --> 27:34.871
I'm gonna stand here like
a rock, OK, until I see her.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.144
You got me?

27:36.172 --> 27:38.050
Hey! Maddy.
I, uh...

27:38.075 --> 27:41.056
What? No salute for
a superior officer?

27:41.078 --> 27:42.455
I'm a commander now.

27:42.479 --> 27:45.153
- Oh! Then, um.
- There you go, Commander.

27:45.182 --> 27:48.858
Uh... You always did like
being on lop anyway, huh?

27:48.887 --> 27:50.264
My, oh my!

27:51.489 --> 27:53.969
- Where, um...
- Where is my grandson?

27:53.992 --> 27:55.939
We're taking good care of him.

27:55.962 --> 27:58.943
- Well, I'm sure you are.
- And the Angie Wagner situation?

27:58.965 --> 28:00.444
- Uh, yes.
- Jake's girlfriend.

28:00.466 --> 28:03.448
We found her car in a garage
where she had it lowed.

28:03.470 --> 28:06.474
She's probably having
a great time with her friends.

28:06.506 --> 28:08.349
Sorry she stood up
your grandson.

28:08.375 --> 28:09.945
He looks like a nice kid.

28:09.977 --> 28:11.616
He is.

29:52.726 --> 29:55.036
Come on!

29:55.061 --> 29:57.041
No, no, no, no!

30:26.463 --> 30:29.034
911. What is the nature
of your emergency?

30:29.066 --> 30:30.704
Hello. My name
is Angie Wagner.

30:30.734 --> 30:32.179
And I've been kidnapped.

30:32.202 --> 30:33.204
Um... My car broke down.

30:33.238 --> 30:35.684
And there was an ambulance
and these SUVs.

30:35.707 --> 30:37.414
And they shot 2 people!

30:37.442 --> 30:39.353
He did! That man from the TV.

30:39.377 --> 30:42.450
- OK, Angie, calm down.
- Tell me where you are.

30:42.481 --> 30:44.688
- He... he... he saw me.
- And he look me to, um...

30:44.717 --> 30:47.527
I don't know. It's-it's...
It's somewhere by the water.

30:47.553 --> 30:50.125
Look, I got out of the room
they were holding me in

30:50.157 --> 30:51.534
and I got this phone.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.834
But I don't know when
they're gonna be back...

30:57.230 --> 30:59.108
- Tell me, Lou.
- What were you thinking

30:59.133 --> 31:00.441
blowing your cover like that?

31:00.468 --> 31:02.345
I wasn't thinking very much.

31:02.370 --> 31:05.078
That's the cover story
you chose, Lou.

31:05.106 --> 31:07.383
We were ready to retire you
to a beach somewhere.

31:07.409 --> 31:10.151
Well, I never really
expected this night lo happen.

31:10.179 --> 31:11.157
Didn't you?

31:11.180 --> 31:12.659
Coming up with that story

31:12.681 --> 31:15.629
about Jake's girlfriend being
mixed up with the Krakhovians...

31:15.652 --> 31:18.223
That is what where
all the evidence points at.

31:18.254 --> 31:20.131
And on top of that,

31:20.156 --> 31:23.502
he tells me you divulged
classified information.

31:24.328 --> 31:27.275
And you told him about us.

31:27.298 --> 31:29.369
- I... I told him about.
- Uh, a double agent.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.244
I didn't use your
name or anything.

31:31.269 --> 31:32.612
But what's the difference?

31:32.637 --> 31:35.413
He's used to his grandpa
telling him these wacky stories.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.249
He never believed a word of it.

31:37.275 --> 31:39.222
He thinks you're
the greatest thing

31:39.245 --> 31:40.622
since the personal computer.

31:40.646 --> 31:42.421
Really, huh?

31:43.249 --> 31:44.387
Hmm...

31:44.417 --> 31:47.729
Tomorrow, we'll relocate
you to a safe house.

31:49.556 --> 31:53.766
Um, would it be all right if
I said goodbye to my grandson?

31:53.794 --> 31:57.299
What for? It'll just make
things harder for everyone.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.143
Excuse me.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.243
Yes?

32:05.274 --> 32:07.345
Officer, you're
needed in the control room.

32:07.376 --> 32:08.650
I'll be right there.

32:12.382 --> 32:15.226
- I've got to go.
- Ah...

32:15.252 --> 32:18.722
Here. You've
got clearance.

32:18.755 --> 32:20.325
Oh...

32:20.357 --> 32:21.632
get yourself a cup of coffee.

32:21.659 --> 32:23.502
Catch a nap
in the officer's mess.

32:23.528 --> 32:25.337
We'll move you out
in a few hours.

32:25.363 --> 32:27.639
OK, thanks.

32:27.665 --> 32:30.670
I'm sorry it has to
be this way, Lou.

32:30.702 --> 32:32.875
Yeah, well...

32:34.339 --> 32:36.910
OK, sweetie.

32:36.942 --> 32:40.755
Thanks. That Angie Wagner thing.
You're sure about that, huh?

32:40.780 --> 32:42.817
She's fine! Quit
torturing yourself.

32:42.849 --> 32:44.226
Gel some rest.

32:44.250 --> 32:47.460
I've been doing that
for years, you know.

32:48.322 --> 32:49.892
Oh, and, Lou...

32:50.925 --> 32:52.336
don't do anything stupid.

32:52.359 --> 32:55.466
I'm getting too old
for the game now.

33:04.707 --> 33:07.278
Come on. Come on. Come on.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.813
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa!

33:11.448 --> 33:14.327
Yeah! Ah...

33:16.587 --> 33:17.930
Oh!

33:17.955 --> 33:19.401
It's OK.

33:19.424 --> 33:20.698
Oh, you reek!

33:20.725 --> 33:22.796
In my country, we have saying;

33:22.827 --> 33:25.569
"If you hide in vat
of manure for 3 days,

33:25.597 --> 33:28.841
"you don't come out
smelling like the roses."

33:34.807 --> 33:36.845
OK!

33:36.876 --> 33:40.449
- This does...
- This does nothing.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.551
Good night, budgie rabbit.

33:47.355 --> 33:50.427
We think it could be
from Komenkho's hideout.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.268
This just came in through 911.

33:52.294 --> 33:53.568
Play it.

33:53.595 --> 33:54.903
Hello! My name
is Angie Wagner,

33:54.930 --> 33:56.432
and I've been kidnapped.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.411
Um... My car broke down.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.276
And there was an ambulance
and these SUVs.

34:00.302 --> 34:03.512
And they shot 2 people!
He did! That man from the TV.

34:03.539 --> 34:06.019
- OK, Angie, calm down.
- Tell me where you are.

34:06.042 --> 34:09.581
- He... he... he saw me.
- And he took me to, um...

34:09.612 --> 34:11.922
I don't know. It's... it's...
It's somewhere by the warez.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.929
Look, I got out of the room
they were homing me in

34:13.951 --> 34:15.453
and I got this phone,

34:15.485 --> 34:16.663
but I don't know
when they're gonna be back.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.870
Call 911.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.429
Give them our
clearance information.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.304
Tell them it was
a training call.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.503
Yes. Ma'am.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.341
- Hey.
- Sir?

34:28.367 --> 34:31.712
I'm here to, um, bring the kid
back to Madeleine Harcourt.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.580
Here you go.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.918
OK, uh.
Let's go, Jake.

34:36.943 --> 34:38.388
What? No.

34:40.013 --> 34:41.492
Excuse me.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.085
Come here, son.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.591
Look, we don't have any time.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.396
I'll tell you about
everything later, all right?

34:48.422 --> 34:49.527
I know all about you.

34:49.556 --> 34:51.400
- Yeah?
- The Section B and everything.

34:51.427 --> 34:53.771
- It's not true.
- Madeleine told me.

34:53.795 --> 34:56.708
Look, quite a few
people in this world

34:56.732 --> 34:58.679
would like to see my ass dead.

34:58.702 --> 35:00.909
So they built this cover story.

35:02.339 --> 35:04.410
- Come on.
- No, man!

35:04.441 --> 35:06.114
I'm not going anywhere with you!

35:06.343 --> 35:10.486
Look, I'm tired of everyone
telling me what to do! OK?

35:10.514 --> 35:15.362
Listen, Angie is
in a lot of trouble.

35:15.387 --> 35:16.491
No, she's not.

35:16.521 --> 35:20.059
Just because we can't find her
does not mean she is missing.

35:20.092 --> 35:21.537
She must be fine.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.437
She is not fine.

35:23.462 --> 35:26.444
And if we don't move.
And I'm talking about right now.

35:26.466 --> 35:29.606
She's gonna be a lot
worse than not fine, OK?

35:31.471 --> 35:32.883
Look at me.

35:34.441 --> 35:36.614
I am not crazy.

35:38.612 --> 35:40.149
How do I know?

35:40.382 --> 35:41.486
You don't.

35:41.516 --> 35:45.487
You don't. But you do know
that I'm your grandfather.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.761
You know I'm kind of capable.

35:47.789 --> 35:50.031
Look, as you get older.

35:50.059 --> 35:51.766
You're gonna have a lot
of these moments.

35:51.794 --> 35:54.604
And when they happen.
The best advice I can give you

35:54.630 --> 35:56.610
is you listen to your
heart and your guts.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.408
And you won't go wrong.

35:59.469 --> 36:00.846
So...

36:02.906 --> 36:04.908
What do you say?

36:10.515 --> 36:12.426
OK.

36:12.450 --> 36:14.021
- OK.
- OK.

36:17.055 --> 36:19.865
Put up the interrogation room.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.871
Zoom in.

36:28.134 --> 36:29.875
Dammit, Lou!

36:29.903 --> 36:31.850
Call security at the entrance.

36:31.872 --> 36:33.909
I'm sure they can
slop Major Crawford.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.649
- Yes, ma'am.
- Security.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.050
Aren't they looking for us?

36:40.081 --> 36:41.651
They are now.

36:43.685 --> 36:44.857
How you doing?

36:44.886 --> 36:47.493
- One moment, sir.
- Are you Major Crawford?

36:47.523 --> 36:48.797
- Uh, yes.
- Yes, I am.

36:48.825 --> 36:51.135
Are you, um. Shocked
and unconscious?

36:52.562 --> 36:55.510
That's the trouble
with this generation.

36:55.532 --> 36:56.738
They have no stamina.

36:57.568 --> 36:59.878
Ma'am...

37:02.873 --> 37:05.582
Hey, so what are we
supposed to do?

37:05.610 --> 37:06.987
They have our car keys.

37:07.011 --> 37:08.581
We don't need car keys.

37:08.613 --> 37:10.923
I, uh...
I got my, uh...

37:11.984 --> 37:13.054
Bobby pin?

37:13.085 --> 37:14.996
No, it's the original bobby pin.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.829
It's my money clip,
my nose plug,

37:16.856 --> 37:20.669
uh, temporary zipper repair
and my lock pick.

37:20.694 --> 37:22.731
- Oh.
- Come on!

37:25.131 --> 37:27.839
- Grandpa, there's a gate!
- Screw it! Hit it.

37:31.105 --> 37:33.517
Should we send men after them?

37:35.176 --> 37:36.747
Ma'am?

37:36.778 --> 37:38.724
Angie got kidnapped by Komenkho.

37:38.747 --> 37:41.819
- Komenkho? No.
- He's dead, remember?

37:41.850 --> 37:44.660
Here's what I think happened;

37:44.686 --> 37:46.257
Angie's on the way to the party.

37:46.289 --> 37:48.997
The car goes on the fritz.
She makes that phone call.

37:49.025 --> 37:52.234
After the phone call, she hears
something from the alley.

37:52.262 --> 37:53.936
She runs out.

37:53.964 --> 37:58.538
She sees this ambulance,
but the patient, he's not dead.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.640
No. He's very much alive.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.812
- I see movement!
- This way!

38:08.747 --> 38:11.820
- Run, run. Run!
- In the trees!

38:13.553 --> 38:17.695
So, they kidnap Angie
and they get her car towed.

38:17.723 --> 38:20.000
So, Komenkho faked
his heart attack.

38:20.027 --> 38:22.564
Well. I mean. He's
indicted on war crimes.

38:22.596 --> 38:23.768
He's got to get out of here.

38:23.797 --> 38:25.640
Angie's his insurance policy.

38:25.666 --> 38:28.580
If we can hack
into the 911 system.

38:28.603 --> 38:30.048
We can get her location.

38:30.071 --> 38:31.675
That's it.

38:31.706 --> 38:33.276
We have to talk to Wendell.

38:33.308 --> 38:34.720
' Who?

38:34.743 --> 38:37.622
- Wendell. Trust me.
- He's the guy.

38:44.721 --> 38:47.099
- Hey, slop! Hey, hey!
- It's Jake. It's Jake.

38:49.259 --> 38:52.707
Look, we need you to hack
into the 911 phone system.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.004
- Now?
- Yeah.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.874
- It's impossible.
- Not for you.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.107
- It's a government system.
- Heavily encrypted.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.138
Maybe if I had
my own terminal, I could...

39:00.172 --> 39:02.743
If we got a government
terminal, would you do it?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.117
- Get up!
- Let's go!

39:04.142 --> 39:04.916
- Now?
- Yeah.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.854
What's going on?

39:21.862 --> 39:22.966
What?

39:28.903 --> 39:33.683
Major Lou Crawford,
on my doorstep!

39:33.709 --> 39:34.847
How you been, Harry?

39:34.877 --> 39:37.756
You come to finally
pay up on that card game?

39:37.780 --> 39:39.885
I will. But I need
your help, all right?

39:39.915 --> 39:41.987
Well. Come on in.

39:43.787 --> 39:45.164
Hi.

39:45.188 --> 39:49.295
Harry, we brought Wendell here
to hack into the 911 system

39:49.326 --> 39:51.864
because we're tracing
a phone call.

39:55.900 --> 39:59.075
Meet the last
of the UNIVAC 2000s.

39:59.104 --> 40:02.916
Built it myself, like
everything else in here.

40:02.941 --> 40:05.012
Jake, the calculator on my phone

40:05.044 --> 40:07.321
is more sophisticated
than this thing.

40:07.347 --> 40:10.294
Well, maybe the Japs have
got you fooled into thinking

40:10.316 --> 40:12.318
that phone of yours
is the cat's teats.

40:12.352 --> 40:14.833
But I ain't never met
a communications system

40:14.855 --> 40:16.835
that could keep out
Old Reliable here.

40:16.857 --> 40:18.803
My phone's from Korea.

40:18.826 --> 40:21.329
Koreans make phones?

40:21.362 --> 40:23.707
Well, what's next?
We make pals with the Cubans?

40:23.732 --> 40:24.733
Actually...

40:24.766 --> 40:25.938
Listen, if you want

40:25.967 --> 40:27.844
to break into
a government system.

40:27.869 --> 40:29.712
My UNIVAC is the
only game in town.

40:31.941 --> 40:34.012
Let me show you
something else here.

40:34.043 --> 40:35.886
Wait till you see this!

40:39.215 --> 40:43.756
The 7th cup.
All from the same bag.

40:45.089 --> 40:46.898
Tea?

40:46.924 --> 40:47.869
Oh, uh...

40:47.892 --> 40:50.839
Tea? What about
my 911 call?

40:50.862 --> 40:53.365
- Right, right.
- Um... All right, boys.

40:53.398 --> 40:55.878
You, go over there
and wait until I tell you

40:55.900 --> 40:56.902
to throw that switch.

40:56.936 --> 40:58.074
You, sit down here

40:58.104 --> 40:59.947
and wait till I tell you
to push the button.

40:59.972 --> 41:01.952
- OK.
- OK. Get ready.

41:01.974 --> 41:03.510
This is safe, right?

41:03.743 --> 41:04.916
Well, we'll soon find out.

41:08.148 --> 41:10.788
All right.
Flip the switch.

41:10.817 --> 41:13.355
Press the button.
Everybody, cover your eyes!

41:16.824 --> 41:18.360
Yahoo!

41:19.827 --> 41:21.398
Whoo-hoo!

41:25.300 --> 41:27.302
What's with all the car alarms?

41:27.336 --> 41:30.546
- Electromagnetic surge!
- It's to be expected!

41:30.774 --> 41:32.913
Come on, Harry! Not again!

41:32.942 --> 41:35.252
I'll hear about
this in the morning.

41:37.213 --> 41:40.354
OK. Where's your
Wi-Fi code?

41:40.384 --> 41:41.954
Wh-what?

41:41.986 --> 41:44.227
- Never mind.
- I'll just improvise.

41:51.296 --> 41:52.866
Hey, Harry, what's that?

41:52.898 --> 41:54.276
Batteries.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.938
Elon Musk's team design.

41:55.968 --> 41:58.471
It can feed this entire
building for a month.

41:58.504 --> 42:01.007
If I can link your
computer to mine,

42:01.040 --> 42:04.921
I should be able to establish a
connection to the 911 database.

42:08.048 --> 42:09.459
I'm in!

42:10.985 --> 42:14.899
OK, locating our time frame...
Let's see what we have.

42:16.858 --> 42:20.136
My cat's stuck up
the tree! Now it's down again!

42:21.997 --> 42:23.908
My name is Angie Wagner and...

42:23.933 --> 42:25.344
Slop! That's it!

42:25.367 --> 42:26.937
Um... My car broke down.

42:26.969 --> 42:29.246
And there was an ambulance
and these SUVs.

42:29.272 --> 42:31.081
And they shot 2 people!

42:31.107 --> 42:32.984
He did! That man from the TV.

42:33.009 --> 42:34.181
Komenkho?

42:34.211 --> 42:36.055
- He saw me.
- And he took me to, um...

42:36.080 --> 42:38.356
I don't know. It's-Jr's
somewhere by the warez.

42:38.382 --> 42:40.919
I got out of the room
they were homing me in

42:40.952 --> 42:42.260
and I got this phone,

42:42.286 --> 42:44.062
but I don't know
when they're gonna be back.

42:46.191 --> 42:48.398
No! Come on, you
got to find them, buddy.

42:48.427 --> 42:49.633
Come on. Please.

42:49.862 --> 42:53.367
I've retraced where
the signal came from.

42:53.399 --> 42:56.346
What do we do now, Grandpa?

42:56.369 --> 42:59.441
Let's get the rest of the Scum.

43:04.345 --> 43:08.054
Boys, I want you to meet our
paratrooper and climbing fool.

43:08.082 --> 43:09.653
This is Mother.

43:11.553 --> 43:13.533
Is he dead?

43:16.658 --> 43:18.332
Ah!

43:19.528 --> 43:21.508
Is that you, Major?

43:21.530 --> 43:23.237
Harry!

43:23.266 --> 43:27.272
Just please
let me go, Mr. Mother.

43:27.304 --> 43:29.011
Give us a little love, brother.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.212
Help me up!

43:36.981 --> 43:37.982
What does it take...

43:41.920 --> 43:44.299
- ' Hey. Wolf!
- Lou!

43:45.624 --> 43:47.035
Harry!

43:47.059 --> 43:49.562
- Wolf!
- Hey!

43:49.595 --> 43:51.371
Mother, you, uh...

43:56.236 --> 43:59.047
This a surprise!
I mean...

43:59.073 --> 44:00.384
- Oh, hey, boys.
- This is, uh, Wolf.

44:00.408 --> 44:02.115
He's our explosives expert.

44:02.143 --> 44:03.178
Hi!

44:03.210 --> 44:05.383
- A man of the cloth...
- Some things do change.

44:05.413 --> 44:09.021
- Honey! Don't leave me hanging.
- I've got a spec...

44:10.485 --> 44:11.987
Some things don't!

44:18.094 --> 44:19.266
I'm sorry.

44:19.295 --> 44:21.969
Shh, Shhh! Shhh!

44:29.640 --> 44:31.017
Grandpa, are you sure
we're supposed 10...

44:31.041 --> 44:32.715
Shhh, Shh, Shhh!

44:37.015 --> 44:39.126
So, you've come to play games
with ol' Giovanni, huh?

44:39.150 --> 44:41.256
I gotta tell you;
I play to win.

44:42.121 --> 44:44.067
Good evening, Giovanni.

44:52.065 --> 44:53.510
Major?

44:55.235 --> 44:56.771
I thought you were dead!

44:57.004 --> 45:00.043
I don't think so, no.
No, but I'm a little older.

45:00.074 --> 45:02.247
But, look, maybe you
can help me.

45:02.276 --> 45:04.756
I'm looking for some
gun-crazed weapons engineer

45:04.779 --> 45:06.088
and a-and a camo expert.

45:06.115 --> 45:08.152
Let me thing about it
for about a week.

45:08.183 --> 45:10.094
- Do that.
- I'll get back to you.

45:10.119 --> 45:11.154
Uh-huh.

45:11.186 --> 45:14.225
Louis! Louis! Louis!

45:15.658 --> 45:18.264
- I thought you were dead.
- No, no.

45:18.294 --> 45:20.433
Scum! It's the Scum!

45:20.463 --> 45:23.240
You're all a bunch of scum!
That's what you are!

45:24.702 --> 45:27.080
- Oh, man!
- And you're still alive!

45:27.104 --> 45:28.082
And you're still alive!

45:28.105 --> 45:29.641
- Yeah!
- You're all old people!

45:29.673 --> 45:31.711
What did you do.
Empty out the rest home?

45:31.743 --> 45:34.189
You got anything
you want to confess?

45:34.212 --> 45:37.193
You can slick that
where the sun don't shine.

45:37.215 --> 45:38.820
Who are the kids?

45:46.292 --> 45:49.103
Gentlemen! Behold!

45:49.129 --> 45:53.339
Averitable Geppetto's workhouse
of military wonders,

45:53.367 --> 45:57.145
where the warrior in you
can find everything he needs

45:57.172 --> 45:59.118
to achieve his greatest dreams.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.813
Hmm!

46:00.842 --> 46:03.345
Oh yeah!

46:06.082 --> 46:07.459
Oh.

46:08.384 --> 46:10.227
Hey! Get away from that gun!

46:10.252 --> 46:12.529
- I'm sorry!
- You ruined my coffee pol!

46:12.556 --> 46:15.162
- I said I was sorry, OK?
- It just looked cool.

46:15.192 --> 46:16.762
You ruined my coffee pol.

46:16.793 --> 46:20.264
- That's too bad.
- That was really good coffee.

46:23.234 --> 46:25.305
OK!

46:25.336 --> 46:28.317
At 7:45 this afternoon.

46:28.339 --> 46:32.254
My grandson's girlfriend
was kidnapped by Krakhovians.

46:32.277 --> 46:34.587
- Krakhovians?
- Komenkho.

46:34.613 --> 46:35.785
Oh boy!

46:35.814 --> 46:39.228
- All right, so.
- This is the warehouse

46:39.252 --> 46:41.323
where they're holding her.

46:41.354 --> 46:42.799
We got 4 entrances here.

46:42.822 --> 46:45.303
What we have to do
is coordinate a strike

46:45.326 --> 46:47.169
at each one of those entrances.

46:47.194 --> 46:49.538
What we need to do first
is get 2 cameras

46:49.563 --> 46:53.340
from these opposite corners here
to cover the whole place.

46:53.367 --> 46:54.676
Now, along this west wall here.

46:54.703 --> 46:56.774
There's a bunch
of these transformers.

46:56.805 --> 46:59.411
And we'll need you
to, uh, sneak in there

46:59.441 --> 47:02.321
and throw that switch off
for a diversion.

47:02.345 --> 47:03.915
Pop it off.

47:04.147 --> 47:05.854
- OK?
- Just pop it off?

47:05.882 --> 47:07.862
Yeah, pop it off.

47:07.884 --> 47:09.864
- This...
- Mm-hmm?

47:09.886 --> 47:11.264
Is you.

47:11.288 --> 47:15.395
You will zip line
from the lower to the roof.

47:15.425 --> 47:18.600
And then rappel down
onto the south entrance.

47:18.630 --> 47:19.665
I'm not going up there!

47:19.697 --> 47:21.938
You were the best
wire man we had.

47:22.167 --> 47:23.202
Please go there, alright?

47:23.234 --> 47:25.475
- Harry...
- Hmm?

47:26.872 --> 47:28.317
The north.

47:28.340 --> 47:31.219
Which is the channel
you'll be coming through.

47:31.243 --> 47:32.244
The north.
That's water

47:32.278 --> 47:34.189
In the water?

47:34.213 --> 47:36.751
That reminds me. I saw
one of them deep-diving suits.

47:36.783 --> 47:39.730
- Yeah, I have that.
- That's vintage, 1944.

47:39.753 --> 47:41.790
- Nice!
- Uh, still works, I think.

47:41.821 --> 47:44.393
You think? What do
you mean, you think?

47:44.425 --> 47:45.631
Ah, 50-50.

47:47.195 --> 47:49.402
- I'm kidding you!
- Oh, OK.

47:49.430 --> 47:52.275
- All right, Wolf.
- Right outside the east side,

47:52.301 --> 47:54.338
about 100, 200 yards
down the road.

47:54.369 --> 47:56.280
There's this trolley.

47:56.305 --> 47:58.615
I want you to load it up
with explosives

47:58.640 --> 48:00.245
and run it into that door.

48:00.276 --> 48:02.313
Splintering it
to smithereens, OK,

48:02.345 --> 48:04.848
just like we did
in Saigon in '71.

48:04.881 --> 48:06.827
- Oh. Whoa, whoa!
- You're kidding, right?

48:06.849 --> 48:08.329
Do I look like I'm Kidding?

48:08.352 --> 48:09.353
Yeah.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.369
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:17.963 --> 48:19.840
Take it easy, guys.

48:22.634 --> 48:27.607
- I want to talk to you about.
- Um, our assault vehicle.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.950
What happened to the Scummobile?

48:34.748 --> 48:36.250
I sold it.

48:36.283 --> 48:38.388
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

48:38.418 --> 48:39.396
I needed the money.

48:39.419 --> 48:41.456
It's not your fault, OK?

48:41.489 --> 48:42.866
Now, is there any chance

48:42.890 --> 48:44.733
that maybe you got.
Uh, something else?

48:44.759 --> 48:47.365
You got another
kind of vehicle or...

48:47.395 --> 48:49.341
That means yes.
When you're smiling.

48:49.364 --> 48:50.537
- Yes!
- Good.

48:50.566 --> 48:52.671
I made it myself. Come here!

48:52.701 --> 48:54.703
Come on, boys! Let's go.

49:04.814 --> 49:06.624
Gentlemen!

49:07.685 --> 49:08.857
Wow!

49:08.886 --> 49:13.426
An original 1979
Volkswagen Transporter 2.

49:14.492 --> 49:15.801
This is awesome!

49:15.827 --> 49:19.866
Lou, what in Heaven's name are
we supposed to do with that?

49:19.898 --> 49:22.401
It could make a great base camp.

49:22.434 --> 49:23.709
Are you serious?

49:23.736 --> 49:26.046
- I kind of like it.
- It looks pretty cool.

49:26.072 --> 49:27.449
But we gonna die!

49:27.473 --> 49:29.453
Are we out of our
Tricking minds here'?

49:29.475 --> 49:30.954
- Hey, Wolf...
- Wolf, nothing!

49:30.977 --> 49:33.390
In case you haven't
noticed, Major.

49:33.414 --> 49:35.451
We're no youngsters anymore.

49:35.482 --> 49:36.688
And I got myself a woman.

49:36.717 --> 49:39.061
And I'm a priest.
And a damned good one!

49:39.086 --> 49:41.499
Maybe we want to think
this thing through.

49:41.523 --> 49:43.002
Let's sleep on it, all right?

49:43.024 --> 49:46.471
- I don't sleep good anymore.
- I pee 8 times a night.

49:46.494 --> 49:48.099
Six in the toilet.

49:48.331 --> 49:50.902
I... I don't think this
is a good time for this.

49:50.933 --> 49:54.380
- Enough of that! OK?
- Forget this crazy talk!

49:54.403 --> 49:57.442
We should all go home.
Forget this night ever happened.

49:57.474 --> 49:58.851
Look, I love you guys.

49:58.875 --> 50:01.378
You're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

50:01.411 --> 50:04.655
May God go with you.
I'm out of here.

50:05.650 --> 50:08.096
I think Wolf has a point, Lou.

50:27.540 --> 50:29.919
It's... I...

50:29.944 --> 50:31.821
I... Uh...

50:42.758 --> 50:44.169
No.

50:46.629 --> 50:48.905
- Another lime.
- Another place, fellas.

50:48.931 --> 50:51.878
Drop in to my church.
It might do you some good.

50:53.603 --> 50:54.582
Bye.

50:54.605 --> 50:56.050
What, that's it?

50:56.073 --> 50:59.577
This is the Devil's Scum
I've heard so much about?

50:59.610 --> 51:02.591
The men who assassinated Hitler.
Who fronted the Tel Offensive?

51:02.613 --> 51:03.786
That's it?

51:03.815 --> 51:05.658
You know what? Just go.

51:05.683 --> 51:09.688
Leave. But I will never
forget this night.

51:09.721 --> 51:11.793
You want to know why?

51:11.824 --> 51:14.737
'Cause this is the night
that I learned about bravery.

51:14.760 --> 51:17.604
And I learned it from
hearing stories about you men.

51:17.630 --> 51:19.166
The Devil's Scum!

51:19.198 --> 51:21.042
Look, my generation.

51:21.067 --> 51:23.570
We have no idea
how good we have it.

51:23.603 --> 51:25.947
OK, we... we... we text
on our smartphones.

51:25.972 --> 51:28.078
We update our statuses
on Facebook.

51:28.109 --> 51:29.620
We... we listen to our music
in the Cloud.

51:29.644 --> 51:32.090
All without realizing
that this world is a safer place

51:32.113 --> 51:34.093
because of men like you.

51:34.115 --> 51:36.494
Men who fought so that kids
like me could be free

51:36.518 --> 51:39.761
lo-lo text and tweet
and "like" and "poke."

51:39.788 --> 51:42.098
OK, you know what I said today?

51:42.124 --> 51:45.663
I said that old people
should be seen and not heard.

51:45.695 --> 51:47.140
It's true. I heard it.

51:47.163 --> 51:49.609
I thought it was
very disrespectful.

51:49.632 --> 51:50.804
Well. I was wrong.

51:50.834 --> 51:53.509
Old people have a lot
to leach my generation.

51:53.537 --> 51:56.143
One thing they don't have to
leach us is how to quit.

51:56.173 --> 51:58.483
'Cause we already
know how to do that.

52:00.611 --> 52:02.091
You know, the Devil's Scum.

52:02.113 --> 52:05.526
You guys look on the world when
the world was a dangerous place.

52:05.550 --> 52:08.554
Well, you know what? The world
is still a dangerous place.

52:08.587 --> 52:11.535
And now more than ever.
We need heroes.

52:11.557 --> 52:13.901
There's a girl
in trouble tonight...

52:15.495 --> 52:17.099
big trouble.

52:18.765 --> 52:20.540
And she needs you.

52:21.869 --> 52:23.780
She needs the Devil's Scum.

52:23.804 --> 52:26.809
So go on.
Leave. Quit.

52:26.841 --> 52:28.878
Do what you want to do.

52:28.910 --> 52:31.857
But I know 2 people
who aren't gonna quit.

52:33.214 --> 52:35.126
Right, Grandpa?

52:38.254 --> 52:40.165
That's right, son.

52:47.597 --> 52:50.043
Wrong.

52:52.603 --> 52:54.674
There's 3 of us.

53:02.648 --> 53:04.787
What do you say, boys?

53:05.984 --> 53:08.761
A chance to go out
on our shields.

53:13.326 --> 53:14.999
Come on.

53:21.268 --> 53:22.747
Wendell?

53:22.770 --> 53:25.684
As long as I'm home
before breakfast.

53:25.707 --> 53:28.085
Mom's making
chocolate-chip pancakes.

53:50.668 --> 53:52.147
Nobody pulls us apart.

53:52.170 --> 53:56.016
Not before we break them apart!

53:56.040 --> 53:58.282
- All right.
- The sun's coming up.

53:58.310 --> 54:00.256
Mm-hmm.

54:00.279 --> 54:03.283
- Up jump the Devil, boys.
- Thank you, sir.

54:22.269 --> 54:24.876
You sure you boys
want to be here?

54:24.906 --> 54:27.250
- Well, I'm so scared.
- I might pee in my pants.

54:27.275 --> 54:28.686
Yeah, I'm all in.

54:31.814 --> 54:34.351
I'm too old for this.

54:51.236 --> 54:53.807
Mother, you all clear up there?

54:53.838 --> 54:55.910
Eagle eye. Two birds
on the roof.

54:55.941 --> 54:57.818
- Cage them all.
- All of them.

54:57.843 --> 54:59.254
Copy that.

55:04.851 --> 55:08.230
Sleep well. Soldiers!

55:14.362 --> 55:16.865
Harry,
there's 2 coming towards you.

55:16.898 --> 55:18.878
Don't blow any bubbles, OK?

55:18.900 --> 55:22.212
- Roger that!
- Where am I going again?

55:23.872 --> 55:25.408
The eyes are on.

55:27.309 --> 55:29.085
Roger.

55:29.112 --> 55:31.217
- It's exposed here.
- Watch for me.

55:31.247 --> 55:35.491
- East/south eyes...
- are hot.

55:35.719 --> 55:39.827
- Copy that.
- Gio. Don't move!

55:39.857 --> 55:41.359
You got a guy coming-

55:41.392 --> 55:43.030
- Hey, zoom out.

55:47.399 --> 55:49.470
- Am I clear?
- Yeah, you're ab' clear:

55:49.501 --> 55:51.344
Now tum off that switch.

55:51.369 --> 55:53.042
All right. Here I go.

55:57.810 --> 56:00.256
Eagle Eye! You
ready to fly, brother?

56:00.279 --> 56:01.849
Oh yeah!

56:05.786 --> 56:06.958
Hey, it's working.

56:08.789 --> 56:11.794
- It's time...
- Yeah? OK.

56:11.826 --> 56:13.533
What do I do if you need help?

56:13.762 --> 56:16.766
Um, it'll come to you.

56:16.798 --> 56:19.370
- Hey, Grandpa...
- Yeah?

56:20.436 --> 56:21.938
Be careful.

56:23.873 --> 56:25.853
Thanks.

56:27.978 --> 56:30.959
- Whoa! No.
- Oh, please!

56:30.981 --> 56:32.085
Don't look down!

56:32.115 --> 56:34.254
Don't look down.
Oh, I looked down.

56:36.454 --> 56:38.559
No! Ah! Oh!

56:38.790 --> 56:40.929
There goes my last kidney.

56:50.969 --> 56:53.450
All right. Got you!

56:54.474 --> 56:56.886
Oh, I gotta get up!
Oh my goodness.

56:56.910 --> 56:58.890
Ah!

57:05.052 --> 57:06.531
Ah!

57:08.088 --> 57:09.898
It's easier with cartilage.

57:09.925 --> 57:13.839
- OK! Here we go.
- Real simple...

57:15.564 --> 57:17.875
Oh, my back!

57:17.900 --> 57:19.971
Why isn't he
flicking the switch?

57:25.542 --> 57:29.513
Lord, please protect Lou
so I can kill him myself!

57:53.340 --> 57:57.049
- Gio! Come on.
- What the heck's going on?

57:57.077 --> 58:01.083
- Lou, hold on a minute.
- A slipped disc.

58:01.115 --> 58:03.061
Ah, two inches.

58:05.119 --> 58:07.100
- Harry?
- Oh!

58:07.122 --> 58:09.068
Which one of those
tanks did you take?

58:09.091 --> 58:11.935
- The one with the...
- The one with the smiley face!

58:14.129 --> 58:17.134
That's happy gas, you idiot!

58:23.306 --> 58:25.548
I want you out
of the water right now!

58:28.579 --> 58:29.990
Come on. Come on!

58:30.014 --> 58:33.326
General, there is
some activity in the water.

58:33.351 --> 58:35.524
Something going on down there.

58:46.465 --> 58:48.969
We might got some troubles.

58:49.002 --> 58:51.414
- Troubles?
- Troubles!

58:53.006 --> 58:54.986
You don't know
that word, "troubles"?

58:55.008 --> 58:57.080
Idiot! You know
that word?

58:57.111 --> 58:59.421
Idiot. Copy.

59:00.281 --> 59:02.056
You know that word?

59:05.054 --> 59:06.328
Yeah...

59:08.057 --> 59:10.003
- Hey, hey!
- S-s-something's going on.

59:10.025 --> 59:13.097
Looks like the...
The guards have been alerted.

59:13.128 --> 59:16.167
All right. We'll use that
as a distraction.

59:16.199 --> 59:18.201
- Now go!
- Roger that.

59:22.173 --> 59:24.983
OK, they're gone! Ah!

59:30.716 --> 59:32.593
- Hands up.
- ' Hmm? '

59:33.719 --> 59:36.427
- Turn around!
- Ah!

59:36.455 --> 59:38.025
Whoo!

59:41.461 --> 59:44.032
Hmm... Uh...

59:44.063 --> 59:45.041
How you doing?

59:51.372 --> 59:54.216
Can one of you guys
help me out of this thing?

01:00:03.252 --> 01:00:06.426
- Gio! How are you?
- Not so good. You?

01:00:08.324 --> 01:00:10.565
- Oh, pretty good.
- Not bad.

01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.204
Grandpa, they're all busted.

01:00:20.238 --> 01:00:21.774
Are you sure?

01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:25.151
Yeah. Well, I'm not sure about
Mother, but the others are.

01:00:25.176 --> 01:00:26.177
What do we do?

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.122
Just stay in that truck, OK?

01:00:28.147 --> 01:00:30.457
I want you to stay
in that truck.

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:32.393
Do that for me please, OK?

01:00:32.418 --> 01:00:34.728
I'll take care of it.

01:00:37.757 --> 01:00:41.261
Grandpa? Grandpa?

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.111
We gotta do something.

01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:50.240
We can't fight the Krakhovians.

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.080
We got midterms next week.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.279
What are you doing?

01:00:53.308 --> 01:00:55.185
What does it
look like I'm doing?

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.518
Come on...

01:00:56.545 --> 01:00:58.525
- No, I...
- Hey, no!

01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:00.254
I'm slaying, you're slaying.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.311
Oh.

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:57.347
Hey, you don't even
know my name, man.

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:10.567
This?

01:02:11.529 --> 01:02:13.805
Batteries for my pacemaker.

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:16.801
- "Pissmaker"?
- "Pacemaker".

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:19.715
Pissmaker!

01:02:21.239 --> 01:02:22.445
Pissmaker!

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.189
I didn't know.

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:29.216
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever,
you Krakhovian cabbage.

01:02:29.248 --> 01:02:31.228
- Shut!
- You shut!

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.730
- You shut!
- Shut you!

01:02:32.753 --> 01:02:34.198
Leave him alone!

01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:44.470
Welcome!

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:47.609
Welcome.

01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:52.580
Welcome.

01:02:53.642 --> 01:02:57.613
Who are you old men?

01:02:57.647 --> 01:02:59.456
Nobody you'd care to know.

01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:03.362
Nobody! Oh!

01:03:03.386 --> 01:03:08.996
"Nobody," says the man
in the green bush.

01:03:09.227 --> 01:03:11.229
Hello!

01:03:11.262 --> 01:03:13.242
Hey!

01:03:13.264 --> 01:03:15.643
And you are here
to do what, huh?

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.806
Arrest me? Oh!

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:22.684
What are you
old fools thinking, huh?

01:03:22.709 --> 01:03:26.282
Come on, guys.
Is this a joke? Huh?

01:03:26.312 --> 01:03:28.519
Is this a joke?
I love jokes. What?

01:03:28.548 --> 01:03:30.391
This is
a joke. Come on!

01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:32.328
We're soldiers.

01:03:32.353 --> 01:03:34.731
Oh, Oh!

01:03:34.755 --> 01:03:38.897
Is that so? Hmm.
And from what century?

01:03:53.442 --> 01:03:55.422
And your commander?

01:03:58.415 --> 01:04:01.021
Oh! OK, I see.

01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:05.364
All for one and one
for all the old farts, huh?

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:10.631
Oh come on, bunny rabbit!
You don't like that? Ah!

01:04:12.798 --> 01:04:16.439
I really hope you guys
wear your old-man diapers.

01:04:17.903 --> 01:04:19.473
Hold your fire!

01:04:19.505 --> 01:04:21.076
Hold on! Take it easy.

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.468
Easy, big guy-

01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:39.463
Ah, thanks, Lou!

01:04:40.929 --> 01:04:42.636
Ah!

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:54.619
Angie, are you all right?

01:04:54.645 --> 01:04:57.455
- Who are you?
- Uh, Lou Crawford.

01:04:57.481 --> 01:05:00.087
- Wait. What, what.
- What, what, what?

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:03.429
What, what, what?
Major Lou Crawford?

01:05:03.455 --> 01:05:06.527
The Major Lou Crawford?

01:05:06.558 --> 01:05:08.936
The... Will you slop that?

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.941
I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:13.136
- Oh. Sorry, Lou.
- Come on!

01:05:13.366 --> 01:05:15.505
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:17.639
The Major Lou Crawford?

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.083
The same Major Lou Crawford
the KGB called...

01:05:21.508 --> 01:05:23.749
- Canuckian?
- Crazy Canuck. Yeah!

01:05:23.777 --> 01:05:25.085
So you know about me, huh?

01:05:25.112 --> 01:05:28.060
I received my military
education in Stalingrad.

01:05:28.082 --> 01:05:31.086
Your exploits were
required reading.

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:32.462
I'm honoured.

01:05:32.487 --> 01:05:34.057
Don't be.

01:05:34.088 --> 01:05:36.968
I was sent
to Stalingrad to study

01:05:36.992 --> 01:05:39.905
after my father was
killed in action,

01:05:39.928 --> 01:05:42.169
by You.

01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:44.174
It's official. We're hosed.

01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:46.642
You probably don't even
know who my father was.

01:05:46.669 --> 01:05:49.548
I pretty much remember
almost everybody I killed.

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:51.574
He wasn't a very nice guy.

01:05:51.608 --> 01:05:53.179
He had a family!

01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:54.856
He had a brother? Sister?

01:05:54.879 --> 01:05:57.758
- Younger sister! She teaches.
- Uh, children how to swim.

01:05:57.782 --> 01:05:59.625
- Mother?
- Of course!

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:00.857
Well, your father.

01:06:00.886 --> 01:06:03.025
He should have thought
of you poor people

01:06:03.054 --> 01:06:05.625
before he tried to buy
that enriched uranium

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:06.829
from one of my spies.

01:06:06.858 --> 01:06:09.965
Mmm... I killed
that spy a few years ago.

01:06:09.996 --> 01:06:11.805
E-e-excuse me!

01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:13.606
You mind if we go and sit down

01:06:13.633 --> 01:06:15.510
while you have
your pissing contest?

01:06:15.535 --> 01:06:16.741
Yeah, no, that's all right.

01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:18.545
- Yeah, it's OK. Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:06:18.572 --> 01:06:20.449
Yeah, I'm good
with that. You?

01:06:20.474 --> 01:06:21.680
- Yeah, yes.
- OK. Sure.

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.949
Look, we all know
that you faked your death

01:06:23.977 --> 01:06:26.584
and that you're trying to
get out of the country.

01:06:26.614 --> 01:06:28.560
So, in the nicest way.
I'm asking you:

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.688
Why don't you let
this poor girl go?

01:06:30.718 --> 01:06:33.757
I would hope that
your superiors know.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.668
They helped me plan my escape.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:40.004
Maddy...

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.533
Maddy! Maddy...

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.170
Yeah, call it a little payback

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:47.045
for all the help I gave ASPIC
in the early '90s.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.209
I helped you take down
the Berlin Wall.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:50.617
Now you help me get away

01:06:50.641 --> 01:06:54.612
from all those, um.
Unpleasant war-crimes trials.

01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:56.022
I don't like them!

01:06:56.047 --> 01:06:58.254
I don't like those.
You know? You know?

01:06:58.483 --> 01:07:01.658
But they just don't know that
I'm going to kill all their men

01:07:01.687 --> 01:07:03.598
and leave the country on my own.

01:07:03.622 --> 01:07:05.659
But I'm crazy like that!

01:07:11.731 --> 01:07:14.075
Uh-huh!
Our ride is here.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.775
What does he mean, "our ride"?

01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:18.750
- Don't worry.
- They can't shoot us here.

01:07:18.772 --> 01:07:20.274
It'd leave too much evidence.

01:07:20.508 --> 01:07:21.885
They'll get caught
before they leave.

01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:25.255
- Very good, Major.
- Man, you still got it.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.696
Or I just shoot you now
and take my chances with ASPIC.

01:07:30.719 --> 01:07:33.564
Oh, aisle seal, please.

01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:34.766
Don't you have a backup plan?

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.771
I... I... I think so, yeah.

01:07:44.902 --> 01:07:47.007
It's the lighter!

01:07:48.573 --> 01:07:51.679
- Angie!
- Jake? Jake!

01:07:54.879 --> 01:07:56.825
- Ah!
- Take cover!

01:08:04.757 --> 01:08:06.829
Mother!

01:08:08.695 --> 01:08:12.336
IT'S A DUD!! IT'S A BLUFF!!

01:08:16.337 --> 01:08:18.339
Cheap commie crap!

01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:19.950
Whose side are You on?

01:08:28.783 --> 01:08:30.787
Hey! Hey!

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.026
I'm sorry. Lou!

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:33.055
Kill them.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.938
- Angie!
- Jake!

01:08:46.236 --> 01:08:48.615
- Jake!
- Hold on! I'm coming!

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.880
Let me go!

01:08:59.085 --> 01:09:00.826
Jake!

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:05.631
We'll be back!

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.265
- Wish me luck.
- Huh?

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:18.148
Mr. Wolf!

01:09:23.879 --> 01:09:26.256
- How about me?
- Giovanni!

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:29.961
Meet your maker!

01:09:33.657 --> 01:09:35.000
Jake!

01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:48.310
No, no, no!

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.216
Ah! Ah!

01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:27.021
Uh...

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:30.230
Canuckian.

01:10:30.253 --> 01:10:33.359
I'll take you upstairs
for insurance. Yeah.

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.496
Come on, bunny rabbit.

01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:37.502
Up! Up!

01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:40.937
Move.

01:10:44.136 --> 01:10:48.278
What are you waiting for?
Go get him!

01:10:52.045 --> 01:10:54.047
Let me go!

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.185
Come on! Let's get
some carrots.

01:10:56.216 --> 01:10:58.389
- Stay here!
- Yeah, I can do that!

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:19.783
Where is the old man?

01:11:22.545 --> 01:11:24.422
How you doing, Harry?

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.928
They're gonna get
a big charge out of this.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.453
- Well, hurry up!
- Whoa, that was close!

01:11:33.258 --> 01:11:34.362
Grandpa?

01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:46.183
- That's right.
- That's right.

01:11:46.205 --> 01:11:49.084
- Let me go!
- Oh!

01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:07.166
- Let me go.
- You stinking pig!

01:12:07.196 --> 01:12:08.971
You little witch!

01:12:08.997 --> 01:12:13.605
If you cannot break the spirit,
break the body. Come on!

01:12:20.076 --> 01:12:21.282
Come on!

01:12:21.311 --> 01:12:24.020
Come on! Don't be scared.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:25.891
It's OK. Come on!

01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:27.418
Komenkho!

01:12:43.102 --> 01:12:45.241
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:08.397 --> 01:13:10.434
Angie? Angie!

01:13:10.466 --> 01:13:13.539
- Jake? Jake!
- What are you doing here?

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:15.049
I came with my
grandpa to get you.

01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:16.550
That old man is your grandpa?

01:13:16.573 --> 01:13:18.575
- Isn't he awesome?
- We have to go!

01:13:18.608 --> 01:13:19.643
He's on the 2nd floor.

01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:21.088
- Do you know where?
- Yes!

01:13:28.185 --> 01:13:30.564
- Hello, kittens!
- Back, back, back!

01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.400
Hello, kittens!

01:13:42.702 --> 01:13:44.978
- Angie?
- Yeah?

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:48.077
- Batter up.
- Yeah.

01:13:48.108 --> 01:13:50.315
I know what you're
thinking right now.

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:52.381
You're thinking to yourself:

01:13:52.413 --> 01:13:54.985
'Why isn't this kid
scared of me?"

01:13:55.016 --> 01:13:57.690
Am I right?
Of course I'm right.

01:13:57.719 --> 01:14:01.030
You're thinking; "What does
this kid know that I don't know

01:14:01.056 --> 01:14:03.037
"that's making him so fearless?

01:14:03.059 --> 01:14:04.504
"Maybe he's insane.

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:09.033
"But maybe, just maybe, this kid
can take care of himself."

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.077
Oh.

01:14:26.684 --> 01:14:28.392
- Hey! Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.422
- I'm fine.
- How... how did you find me?

01:14:30.456 --> 01:14:33.096
- Grandpa.
- What-what about your grandpa?

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.695
I'll tell you about it later.

01:14:34.727 --> 01:14:36.002
Oh.

01:14:37.197 --> 01:14:38.403
How's that for confidence?

01:14:38.431 --> 01:14:40.069
- That was good.
- Not bad, huh?

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.408
- I liked it.
- That was good.

01:14:41.434 --> 01:14:43.141
- Grandpa?
- Let's go.

01:14:44.672 --> 01:14:46.276
Ah!

01:14:50.077 --> 01:14:52.079
, I'm empty!

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:56.324
- Don't ask me. I'm out!
- Time to put her on!

01:14:57.586 --> 01:15:00.089
Ah! Switches...

01:15:00.122 --> 01:15:03.195
Ah! I think I'm ready.

01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:07.368
It's getting hot!

01:15:07.397 --> 01:15:10.277
Harry, do your magic!

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.177
Wait! What?

01:15:39.266 --> 01:15:41.246
Pissmaker...

01:15:41.268 --> 01:15:45.240
Harry! I love you, Harry!

01:15:45.273 --> 01:15:47.184
God works in wondrous ways

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:49.119
with a little help
from you, Harry!

01:15:49.143 --> 01:15:51.124
I knew you could do it!

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.557
- This way!
- This way!

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.586
- No, no, no!
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.156
What?

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:06.503
Follow me. Come on.

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:09.272
Oh.

01:16:15.172 --> 01:16:16.311
Ah!

01:16:18.844 --> 01:16:20.790
Hey! Grandpa, you OK?

01:16:20.812 --> 01:16:22.519
I think so.

01:16:23.648 --> 01:16:24.649
Watch out!

01:16:26.786 --> 01:16:28.459
I kill you all.

01:16:37.664 --> 01:16:39.337
Bluff!

01:16:39.366 --> 01:16:40.607
A backup plan.

01:16:40.635 --> 01:16:42.342
They're 2 MID 69 super-EX mines,

01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:44.475
and they'll barbecue
your ass to a crisp.

01:16:44.506 --> 01:16:49.252
What are you? Some kind of
big soldier now, huh?

01:16:49.278 --> 01:16:50.279
- Nope.
- Huh?

01:16:50.312 --> 01:16:51.916
Major Lou Crawford's grandson.

01:16:54.183 --> 01:16:57.324
- They're only smoke bombs?
- Yeah. I lied!

01:16:57.354 --> 01:16:59.334
That's my boy!

01:17:00.423 --> 01:17:03.267
You guys slay there.
Do not move.

01:17:03.293 --> 01:17:04.772
OK.

01:17:09.267 --> 01:17:12.214
- Excuse me.
- Ah!

01:17:16.775 --> 01:17:18.254
Ah!

01:17:31.959 --> 01:17:33.870
Come on.

01:17:37.398 --> 01:17:39.208
Hey! You OK?

01:17:39.234 --> 01:17:40.611
- Oh!
- Ooh!

01:17:40.635 --> 01:17:42.205
Yeah.

01:17:42.237 --> 01:17:43.614
Well, that probably hurt.

01:17:44.806 --> 01:17:47.720
- Ah! Good job, son.
- I'm proud of you.

01:17:47.743 --> 01:17:50.656
Well, I've learned
from the best.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.956
What did you say to me?

01:17:53.983 --> 01:17:55.554
No, I got it.

01:17:56.987 --> 01:17:58.625
I got it.

01:17:58.655 --> 01:18:02.501
No, I'm not that old.
I get it. OK.

01:18:02.526 --> 01:18:04.404
Who was that, Lou?

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:08.400
- Uh, Harcourt. She's, uh.
- Right outside here somewhere.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:11.642
So, uh, again.
Boys, good job.

01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:14.276
- Ah! It was fun, Lou!
- A walk in the park.

01:18:14.306 --> 01:18:18.015
Only next time, Lou, make the
mission a little bit difficult.

01:18:19.878 --> 01:18:21.415
That was awesome!

01:18:21.448 --> 01:18:23.485
Hey, do I get a cigar too?

01:18:23.516 --> 01:18:26.360
When you start
shaving, Einstein.

01:18:38.467 --> 01:18:40.708
The scene is secure.

01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:41.908
Copy that.

01:18:41.937 --> 01:18:45.351
Hey, Jakey! Introduce us
to your girlfriend.

01:18:46.776 --> 01:18:49.052
Uh, yeah. Angie.
This is Scum.

01:18:49.279 --> 01:18:53.786
Scum, this is Angie.
And she is not my girlfriend.

01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:55.353
Like hell I'm not!

01:18:56.987 --> 01:18:58.660
Come here.

01:18:59.523 --> 01:19:00.831
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:19:00.858 --> 01:19:02.930
- Nice!
- Little boy's growing up!

01:19:02.961 --> 01:19:04.963
Nice!

01:19:07.866 --> 01:19:11.815
Angie, if I were
60 years younger...

01:19:11.837 --> 01:19:13.680
Hey!

01:19:13.706 --> 01:19:15.686
Is that Madeleine Harcourt?

01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:18.347
No fatalities.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.460
My, she's a hot one!

01:19:22.482 --> 01:19:24.428
- I wish I was 70 again.
- Yeah!

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:36.976
- My, oh my, Lou!
- What have you done?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.480
Exactly what you
wanted me to do, dear.

01:19:40.502 --> 01:19:42.072
Figured it out, did you?

01:19:42.104 --> 01:19:45.814
- Yeah, I was a little.
- Uh, little late on that.

01:19:45.842 --> 01:19:49.380
But I started thinking
and I was wondering,

01:19:49.412 --> 01:19:51.517
and then it came to me.

01:19:51.548 --> 01:19:54.428
How the heck did I get
out of that agency

01:19:54.452 --> 01:19:56.454
with the kid, so fast, so easy?

01:19:56.487 --> 01:19:57.659
How did that happen?

01:19:57.688 --> 01:19:59.690
Just because some
politician tells me

01:19:59.724 --> 01:20:02.467
I have to help the bastard
get out of the country,

01:20:02.494 --> 01:20:04.599
it doesn't mean I
have to get in the way

01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:06.040
of someone trying to stop him.

01:20:06.064 --> 01:20:08.909
Yeah, well, you could
have got us all killed.

01:20:08.935 --> 01:20:10.778
It was a risk I was
willing to take.

01:20:10.803 --> 01:20:13.784
He had the girl, and there was
nothing I could do to help her.

01:20:13.806 --> 01:20:16.013
You almost got
my grandson killed!

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:18.455
Who told you to bring him along?

01:20:19.546 --> 01:20:22.686
Lou, darling.

01:20:22.716 --> 01:20:25.459
We've seen so much
action together.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.023
Let's put this behind us.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:30.161
Everyone's fine;
your grandson. Your men...

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:33.670
It's been a good mission.
Just like the old days.

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:37.473
Like the
old days. Exactly!

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.446
- Medic!
- What's going on over there?

01:20:42.472 --> 01:20:43.974
- What the heck?
- Grandpa!

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:46.044
- Are you OK, sir?
- What's wrong with him?

01:20:46.076 --> 01:20:48.613
He's going into cardiac arrest.
Bring a stretcher!

01:20:48.645 --> 01:20:50.455
Get him to an ambulance now!

01:20:52.517 --> 01:20:54.656
Grandpa, you're gonna be OK.

01:20:57.555 --> 01:20:58.933
You got him?

01:21:00.025 --> 01:21:02.528
Wait, wait, wait!

01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:04.903
Don't be scared, son.

01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:07.605
- I'm sorry. We have to go.
- Move! Move!

01:21:07.634 --> 01:21:09.705
Dock him in.

01:21:11.671 --> 01:21:12.877
- Go straight in.
- No, no, no.

01:21:12.906 --> 01:21:17.447
Jake, you stay here.
It's better. Better.

01:21:17.478 --> 01:21:18.855
Go. Ma'am.

01:21:20.181 --> 01:21:22.718
All clear.
Close them up.

01:21:57.623 --> 01:22:00.126
We'll see you back
at the house, OK, Jake?

01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:03.640
Take your time.

01:22:03.662 --> 01:22:05.665
Such a great guy.

01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:12.516
How are you doing?

01:22:13.908 --> 01:22:15.717
I'm fine.

01:22:16.744 --> 01:22:18.155
Really?

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.253
No.

01:22:23.952 --> 01:22:25.556
Jakey, you got a moment?

01:22:25.587 --> 01:22:27.567
I'll see you back
at the house, OK?

01:22:27.589 --> 01:22:28.966
Yeah.

01:22:30.593 --> 01:22:32.971
She's a great gal, Jakey.

01:22:34.163 --> 01:22:36.040
Only one at school
worth fighting for.

01:22:36.065 --> 01:22:40.537
Yeah, me and the boys,
uh, we were talking.

01:22:40.571 --> 01:22:43.677
There's something
about your grandfather

01:22:43.707 --> 01:22:45.709
we think you should know.

01:22:46.745 --> 01:22:48.190
You see...

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:53.093
When your grandpa was
released from active duty...

01:22:54.286 --> 01:22:56.062
they wanted to relocate him

01:22:56.088 --> 01:22:59.297
lo a place like
the Bahamas or Switzerland

01:22:59.325 --> 01:23:00.702
so he'd be safe.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:04.140
You know, all those villains
were after him, like Komenkho.

01:23:05.165 --> 01:23:06.735
But he wouldn't go.

01:23:09.002 --> 01:23:11.175
Grandpa never could
run from a fight.

01:23:12.807 --> 01:23:15.014
We... we ran from
lots of fights, him and us.

01:23:15.043 --> 01:23:17.717
That's why we all
made it as long as we did.

01:23:17.745 --> 01:23:21.956
Your grandfather wouldn't
leave because of you.

01:23:22.818 --> 01:23:24.627
Me?

01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:26.929
He wanted to be close to you.

01:23:26.956 --> 01:23:30.598
It was his idea to...

01:23:31.828 --> 01:23:36.244
lo fake being senile.
End up in a nursing home.

01:23:36.267 --> 01:23:37.974
Perfect cover!

01:23:38.002 --> 01:23:41.211
So the bad boys
would feel sorry for him

01:23:41.238 --> 01:23:42.911
and, uh, leave him alone.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.114
And it...
Hell, it worked.

01:23:46.745 --> 01:23:48.281
He kept up the act...

01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:53.753
all those years.
Just to see you grow up.

01:23:57.724 --> 01:24:00.261
We only took him out of
that home twice a month.

01:24:00.293 --> 01:24:02.672
Yeah, well, that was
good enough for him.

01:24:02.696 --> 01:24:05.677
He, uh, wanted you
to have these.

01:24:12.874 --> 01:24:14.046
And these...

01:24:16.878 --> 01:24:18.984
You're family now, kiddo.

01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:21.920
Nothing pulls us apart.

01:24:22.885 --> 01:24:24.694
We thought you should know.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.894
Thank you.

01:24:34.365 --> 01:24:36.345
Up jumps the Devil.

01:24:36.367 --> 01:24:38.313
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:36.108
So, what's the
plan tonight, Picasso?

01:25:36.134 --> 01:25:37.909
- Oh, let's see...
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:37.936 --> 01:25:39.438
- I come to your game...
- OK.

01:25:39.471 --> 01:25:42.282
Watch you beat the snot
out of Westmore Academy,

01:25:42.308 --> 01:25:44.845
and then take you
out to celebrate?

01:25:44.877 --> 01:25:46.049
Done!

01:25:46.078 --> 01:25:47.455
And my parents aren't home.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.256
Oh, well, maybe we could, um...

01:25:49.282 --> 01:25:52.286
Hey! What an
adorable couple!

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:55.230
Grandpa?

01:25:57.357 --> 01:25:58.803
Nice!

01:26:00.962 --> 01:26:02.805
Grandpa!

01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:06.446
Hey, kid!

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.812
- Hey!
- Hi, Angie!

01:26:08.837 --> 01:26:11.443
What is this? I mean,
you're supposed to be...

01:26:11.473 --> 01:26:13.419
- Dead!
- Yeah!

01:26:13.442 --> 01:26:14.854
Yeah, officially, I am,

01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:16.858
but I got to tell you.
It's very liberating.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.486
- I... I don't understand.
- Uh, how?

01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:22.794
Well, uh, the lunatic asylum
I was in over there...

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.128
I hated it at the nursing home.

01:26:24.155 --> 01:26:26.362
So Maddy was gracious
enough to get me out.

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:29.030
So, "dead," now.
Is my, uh, cover.

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:31.802
You pulled a Komenkho
and faked your own death?

01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:32.934
- Yeah, but see.
- That guy,

01:26:32.964 --> 01:26:34.944
he got a beautiful nice
funeral out of it.

01:26:34.966 --> 01:26:36.343
You know what I mean?

01:26:38.003 --> 01:26:40.883
- I, uh... Mom!
- Grandpa, we gotta tell Mom!

01:26:40.907 --> 01:26:42.215
- Oh, no.
- No, no. No.

01:26:42.241 --> 01:26:44.881
Uh, let me get settled
for a little while.

01:26:44.911 --> 01:26:46.254
And we'll bring her up to speed.

01:26:46.279 --> 01:26:47.918
You know, once
I get settled, OK?

01:26:47.948 --> 01:26:49.256
Well, where are you going?

01:26:49.283 --> 01:26:51.991
- Well, I'm, uh...
- Coming, darling?

01:26:53.954 --> 01:26:55.433
Hi, Mr. Bouchard!

01:26:55.455 --> 01:26:56.833
Hi, Ms. Harcourt!

01:26:56.858 --> 01:26:59.862
Yeah, she's, uh, she's got
a little farm down in Mexico.

01:26:59.894 --> 01:27:02.932
No televisions.
No TVs. No minivans.

01:27:02.964 --> 01:27:06.469
Pigs, ducks, you know, sun,
a few of the blue pills...

01:27:08.037 --> 01:27:10.415
- Perfect, right?
- You are something else.

01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:12.112
- You know that?
- Yeah, man!

01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:17.889
Oh, by the way...

01:27:17.914 --> 01:27:19.086
No, no, no!

01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:21.426
Keep those, you know.
In case I feel, like, bored.

01:27:21.452 --> 01:27:23.261
And I want to come
out of retirement.

01:27:23.287 --> 01:27:25.358
- OK.
- I gotta go, you guys.

01:27:25.389 --> 01:27:26.959
OK, yeah.

01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:28.436
- Bye. Gorgeous!
- Bye!

01:27:28.459 --> 01:27:32.169
And, um, I will, uh, text
you guys in a little while.

01:27:32.197 --> 01:27:35.576
- Oh! Hey, Grandpa.
- By the way...

01:27:37.069 --> 01:27:39.243
What are you gonna do on a farm?

01:27:39.272 --> 01:27:42.651
What do you know about
chickens, pigs or goals?

01:27:42.876 --> 01:27:44.014
Let me tell you something.

01:27:44.043 --> 01:27:48.618
If I can destroy Death Star
and save the galaxy...

01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:50.492
Star Wars? Really?

01:27:50.517 --> 01:27:52.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:27:52.052 --> 01:27:55.125
Lucas, that bum, he took
2 planets, changed the names...

01:27:55.156 --> 01:27:57.636
So, legally, it became
a different story.

01:27:57.659 --> 01:28:01.937
Exactly. That's why I
don't get one cent of royalties.

01:28:01.963 --> 01:28:04.604
- That guy...
- That guy!

01:28:07.136 --> 01:28:08.672
I got to feed some of the...

01:28:09.305 --> 01:28:15.503
