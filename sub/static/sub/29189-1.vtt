00:17.308 --> 00:19.310
<i>I used to look up at space</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:23.356
<i>with hope and wonder
in my eyes.</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
<i>Until space looked back.</i>

00:28.027 --> 00:29.279
<i>Invader Zim,</i>

00:29.487 --> 00:33.283
<i>evil,
alien soldier of the Irken Empire</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:36.369
<i>sent by his diabolical masters,</i>

00:36.619 --> 00:38.079
<i>the Almighty Tallest,</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:39.539
<i>to infiltrate Earth</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:41.833
<i>and prepare it for
the coming invasion.</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:45.295
<i>Disguised as one of us,</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:47.422
<i>he moved into my neighborhood,</i>

00:47.505 --> 00:49.007
<i>he went to my school,</i>

00:49.257 --> 00:52.802
<i>and with the help
of his vile mechanical servants,</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.722
<i>plotted to destroy
everything we have,</i>

00:55.805 --> 00:58.016
<i>everything we are.</i>

00:58.099 --> 00:59.726
<i>And then...</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:01.311
<i>he vanished.</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:04.188
<i>My name is Dib Membrane.</i>

01:04.772 --> 01:06.816
I'm 12 years old.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.986
<i>And I'm all that stands
between Zim</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:12.989
<i>and the annihilation
of our world.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:23.249
Prepare your starving,
gurgling child-bellies

01:23.333 --> 01:25.752
for the awesome eventuality

01:25.835 --> 01:27.587
of dinner!

01:38.348 --> 01:41.684
Foodio 3000 hopes you love
what I have made.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.895
Also, what is love?

01:43.978 --> 01:46.481
Looks great, Dad.
I'm gonna eat that food.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.000
Hold up now, daughter!

01:48.024 --> 01:49.818
Isn't it time your brother joined us?

01:50.443 --> 01:51.820
Oh, man, no.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.405
Since Zim vanished,
Dib's been in his room for,

01:54.489 --> 01:56.157
like, a million years.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.284
I hardly recognize him anymore.

01:58.368 --> 02:02.163
He just sits there in that chair
getting grosser...

02:02.831 --> 02:04.290
smellier.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.227
He sure does,

02:06.251 --> 02:08.211
but try to be
more understanding.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.880
Dib's finally letting go
of his silly obsession

02:10.964 --> 02:12.382
with aliens and ghosts

02:12.465 --> 02:15.718
and all his other
non-scientific nonsense.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.720
And it's not easy for him.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.808
Imagine if you stopped believing in,
oh, video games.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.476
Don't even joke about that, Dad.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.355
Honey, letting go of silly ideas

02:27.438 --> 02:28.815
is just part of growing up.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.233
Why, as a child,

02:30.316 --> 02:32.694
I thought sharks were my friends.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.656
I know better now.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.885
So, try to be more supportive.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.161
He's your brother, after all.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.872
Okay, Dad.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.406
Hey, Dib!
Dad says come to dinner!

03:22.952 --> 03:25.747
You know
I can't leave my post, Gaz.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.749
Just shove the food in here.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.167
Where's the shoving stick?

03:29.250 --> 03:31.753
I can't shove without
the shoving stick.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.631
Zim's still out there, Gaz,
so I have to wait

03:34.964 --> 03:36.257
and watch.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.968
No one else will.
They could never see the truth.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.720
Why, though? Brainwashing?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.055
Mind control?

03:42.138 --> 03:45.225
Brain-erasing ghosts?

03:45.308 --> 03:48.561
Nobody believes me now,
but I'll make them see.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.730
I'll expose Zim to the world,

03:50.813 --> 03:52.941
and open humanity's eyes

03:53.024 --> 03:56.819
to the danger they were in all along.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.949
Even Dad, world-famous
man of science will say,

04:01.032 --> 04:02.784
"I believe you, Dib.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.078
I'm sorry I ever doubted you."

04:05.495 --> 04:07.789
That's the worst
Dad impression ever,

04:07.872 --> 04:10.833
but, Dib, let it go.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.753
Zim's been gone a long time,

04:13.836 --> 04:17.089
and as far as you know,
he might just be gone for good.

04:17.966 --> 04:23.012
I'd be willing to bet
that Zim will never, ever...

04:23.096 --> 04:24.138
Oh, wait, there he is.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.307
It's Zim!

04:26.933 --> 04:29.686
He's back!
And he's doing stretches!

04:29.769 --> 04:32.209
Nobody stretches like that
unless they're warming up for evil!

04:32.563 --> 04:34.816
This is it! The...

04:34.899 --> 04:38.194
moment I've been...

04:38.278 --> 04:39.988
waiting for!

04:40.071 --> 04:41.114
What are you doing?

04:41.197 --> 04:44.826
Gotta get to Zim!

04:45.368 --> 04:47.662
Dib, no. Look at you.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.540
The world's not ready to see
what you've become.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.874
You're hideous!

04:53.418 --> 04:55.128
The smell!

04:55.211 --> 04:57.880
The world...

04:57.964 --> 04:59.465
needs me!

04:59.549 --> 05:00.776
Take a bath first!

05:00.800 --> 05:01.884
Take...

05:02.468 --> 05:04.095
Take a bath!

05:04.178 --> 05:07.223
No!

06:33.601 --> 06:35.019
Zim!

06:36.312 --> 06:40.399
Yes, it is I, and... Hmm?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.883
Oh, wait, sorry.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.611
You'll have to move along,
hideous goblin.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.572
I'm posing dramatically
for when the Dib shows up.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.533
- I am Dib.
- What?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.202
- Ugh, ugh, ugh! Ugh!
- But...

06:51.285 --> 06:53.388
- Give me a sec here.
- We know each other.

06:54.539 --> 06:58.417
I've been expecting you, Dib!

06:59.085 --> 07:00.545
I can tell.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.463
You set up sprinklers
and everything.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.136
You can't prove anything!

07:08.219 --> 07:10.388
- Anyhow, I...
- Where have you been, Zim?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.306
I've been monitoring
your house, the school,

07:12.390 --> 07:13.975
that taco place
you love so much.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.476
No, no.
GIR loves that place.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.727
I think it's dirty.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.688
- I ate a baby there.
- He did.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.315
What have you been up to, Zim?

07:21.399 --> 07:25.236
Phase one
of my evil plan, human.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.155
Phase one.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.804
Computer! Laugh with me!

07:51.888 --> 07:53.389
I don't want to.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.774
You've been in your house

08:03.858 --> 08:06.527
sitting in the toilet all this time?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.280
- Yes.
- Like, the whole time?

08:09.363 --> 08:10.363
That's right.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.033
Did you have to sit in the toilet?

08:12.116 --> 08:17.163
Do not try to understand
the ways of my people, Dib!

08:19.582 --> 08:21.834
From the moment
my mission began

08:21.918 --> 08:24.587
on this horrible planet,
you've been there,

08:24.670 --> 08:26.380
haunting my every move

08:26.464 --> 08:28.633
like a squak
in my shmoopsquizz.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.676
- A what in your huh?
- Uh-huh!

08:30.760 --> 08:33.971
And while the rest of your kind
were easily fooled,

08:34.054 --> 08:35.932
you were able to see through

08:36.015 --> 08:38.267
my brilliant disguise.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.355
Martha!

08:42.438 --> 08:44.732
- Eh?
- The neighbor boy's an alien!

08:46.984 --> 08:48.444
Never mind, Martha.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.738
- He's normal.
- Okay.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.324
I knew if I vanished
for long enough,

08:53.407 --> 08:55.243
you'd just watch and wait,

08:55.326 --> 08:57.745
your neglected body
growing smelly

08:57.828 --> 08:59.497
and useless.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.793
But that was only Phase One
of my evil plan.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.128
Well, keep watching, Dookie-Dib.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.631
Watch helplessly as I begin...

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
Phase Two!

09:14.220 --> 09:15.721
- Hah!
- No!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.765
I'm switching people's mail around.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.935
That's illegal. No!

09:21.477 --> 09:22.853
I'm reading
someone's newspaper.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.898
I don't pay for a subscription.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.193
Nobody reads newspapers anymore,
but, no, stop!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.404
Minimoose, get in on this mayhem!

09:35.449 --> 09:36.993
That's my mom's pizza sticker.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.371
She is crazy for pizza.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.892
Hey, what... what are you...
Hey, that... that's...

09:43.916 --> 09:45.167
Hey, don't... Wait.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.420
Don't! Don't!

09:47.878 --> 09:49.088
Don't!

09:57.555 --> 09:58.681
Excellent.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.184
Me! Me!
Let me do one.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.191
I launched that pug into space.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.295
I thought you liked that pig.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.196
- Why I do that?
- What's the matter, human?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.656
Why aren't you stopping me?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.783
Can't fight back.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.702
Sat too long.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.121
Chair fused to butt.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.540
More chair than man now.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.543
Humans are such fragile, goopy things.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.795
No Irken would ever
become a chair.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.964
Wait! Was that Phase Two?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.799
Of course it was!

10:34.550 --> 10:35.968
Probably. Uh...

10:36.052 --> 10:37.303
You know what?
Now I'm not sure.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.972
Either way,
you're helpless to stop me,

10:40.056 --> 10:41.390
Chair-Dib.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.642
So long!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.393
Welcome home, son.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.941
Zim!

11:09.502 --> 11:11.420
Excellent work, me.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.675
All is going according to plan,
but there's still much to do, GIR.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.136
Yes, sir!

11:24.600 --> 11:27.103
<i>I bloop you, Schmoopsy!</i>

11:27.186 --> 11:29.230
<i>Floopsy...</i>

11:29.313 --> 11:30.439
<i>Aww.</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:31.649
Computer?

11:31.732 --> 11:33.317
What?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.569
Open a connection with
the Almighty Tallest,

11:35.653 --> 11:37.988
my leaders and biggest fans.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.674
Preparing to call The Tallest.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.242
You see, GIR, The Tallest...

11:41.325 --> 11:42.386
Now calling The Tallest!

11:45.204 --> 11:47.456
The Tallest
haven't heard from me,

11:47.540 --> 11:50.459
their greatest
and most incredible invader,

11:50.543 --> 11:52.253
in a very long time.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.096
They'll be sick with worry.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.002
Hey, remember Invader Zim?

12:33.627 --> 12:35.004
- Who?
- Zim.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.213
Tiny?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.299
Screamed a lot?

12:38.382 --> 12:40.301
The guy that sends us the donuts?

12:40.801 --> 12:44.472
No, that's Invader Jim.
He's great.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.558
Oh, wait. Zim.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.603
- We hate him!
- Yeah, that's him.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.396
Remember the time
we lied and told him

12:52.480 --> 12:54.400
we were sending him on
a secret mission to Earth,

12:54.440 --> 12:56.835
but really we were just getting
rid of him because he's awful?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.737
Yeah. We're hilarious.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.240
My Tallest,
there's an incoming transmission.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.326
Yep, life's been pretty great

13:05.409 --> 13:07.244
ever since
Zim vanished for good.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.705
Anyhow, send that transmission through.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.916
I wonder who it could ever be.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.250
<i>It is I, Zim!</i>

13:22.968 --> 13:25.721
<i>My Tallest, you will be overjoyed to know</i>

13:25.804 --> 13:29.058
<i>Phase One of my most ingenious plan</i>

13:29.141 --> 13:32.311
<i>to prepare Earth
for your arrival was a success.</i>

13:32.686 --> 13:35.231
Zim, we thought you were dead.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.527
<i>Could a dead Zim do this?</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:47.284
<i>Sirs,</i>

13:47.368 --> 13:49.787
<i>my Earthly arch-nemesis
is now a sad chair,</i>

13:49.870 --> 13:51.413
<i>leaving me free to complete</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:54.416
<i>the most diabolical phase of my plan,</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:56.377
<i>Phase Two,</i>

13:56.460 --> 13:58.462
wherein I, uh...

13:58.546 --> 14:00.881
Uh, uh, uh...

14:03.759 --> 14:05.886
Computer, put them on hold.
Oh, no.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.639
I really can't remember
what Phase Two is.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.724
I must have sat in that toilet too long.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.518
Think, Zim. Think.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.395
<i>We don't care, Zim.</i>

14:14.478 --> 14:16.855
Why didn't I write it down?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.607
Wait! Computer,

14:18.691 --> 14:22.403
play back any recordings
of me discussing Phase Two.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.904
One recording found.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.449
<i>Would you like me to record any
and all mention of Phase Two?</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:30.035
<i>No, thank you.
Zim forgets nothing.</i>

14:30.411 --> 14:33.455
Hmm, besides reminding me
how cool I look and sound,

14:33.539 --> 14:34.957
that was of no help.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.710
<i>He knows we can still see
and hear him, right?</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:39.503
<i>I liked when he was dead.</i>

14:39.587 --> 14:43.215
I remember Phase Two!

14:43.299 --> 14:46.218
You do? Good work, GIR! Tell me.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.888
You gonna order a million pizzas,

14:48.971 --> 14:51.390
and then I gotta roll around
in them pizzas,

14:51.473 --> 14:56.520
and that's the story
about how I turn into a giant pizza.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.526
This isn't the time
for the giant pizza story, GIR.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.320
And that will never happen!

15:10.492 --> 15:12.077
Silence! I need to think!

15:12.161 --> 15:14.496
Just calm down and...

15:17.249 --> 15:20.294
Computer, did you put The Tallest on hold?

15:20.377 --> 15:22.338
Nope.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.969
- Hmm?
- Huh?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.405
I don't think they heard anything.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.222
Yes, they did.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.683
I am Irk's finest Invader.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.227
If The Tallest find out
I failed to dominate the Earth

15:37.311 --> 15:39.229
because I forgot Phase Two,

15:39.313 --> 15:41.315
who knows what they'll do?

15:41.398 --> 15:42.733
Hmm?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.201
Invader Zim,

15:52.284 --> 15:56.580
you were once our best,
most amazing Invader,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.166
but now, you're dumb.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.335
Also, stupid.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.505
As punishment,
you will be stripped of your Invader rank,

16:04.588 --> 16:06.674
re-encoded as nothing.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.134
But you can't! I am Zim!

16:10.761 --> 16:12.721
Control Brains, re-encode.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.601
Re-encoding.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.565
It is done, My Tallest.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.027
Zim, you will live out

16:27.111 --> 16:30.948
the rest of your long, sad days as...

16:32.866 --> 16:34.910
Wait, no, never mind.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.539
GIR, time is of the essence.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.558
The Tallest could be here any day now...

16:40.582 --> 16:42.543
...and Dib won't stay a chair forever.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.169
Go to my scheming lab,

16:44.253 --> 16:46.547
and bring me everything
that could be Phase Two.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.465
Quickly!

18:18.972 --> 18:20.265
Ahh.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.479
Useless dookie!

18:27.898 --> 18:30.317
I need more time
to remember Phase Two.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.821
Computer, how much longer do I have
before The Tallest arrive?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.323
Information unknown.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.741
Unacceptable.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.079
Access The Tallest's computers
and retrieve their flight plan.

18:42.162 --> 18:46.125
Ooh, yes, right away, sir.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.626
Are you doing an accent?

18:47.709 --> 18:48.585
I get bored.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.713
P.S. There is insufficient power
to access the flight plan.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.801
Then find more power,
and be sneaky about it.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.722
Activating sneaky mode.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
Sneaking!

19:04.768 --> 19:06.395
Sneaking!

19:07.604 --> 19:09.231
Sneaking!

19:12.025 --> 19:15.529
Sneaking!

19:21.451 --> 19:23.203
Flight plan retrieved.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.335
Along this line is every world

19:30.419 --> 19:32.462
the Irken Armada plans to conquer,

19:33.213 --> 19:35.007
but where's Earth?

19:35.090 --> 19:38.135
The Tallest said it was
the most important mission of all.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.595
Computer, zoom out.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.889
Zooming out.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.016
Hmm.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.143
Keep zooming out
until you find out

19:46.226 --> 19:48.437
how far The Tallest are
from Earth.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.064
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.859
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.486
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.155
- Hurry it up.
- Zooming out.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.990
- Zooming out.
<i>- Vámonos!</i>

20:00.073 --> 20:01.867
I must begin Phase Two

20:01.950 --> 20:04.870
before Dib gets back into
annoying fighting shape.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.747
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.999
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.960
Hmm, I'm sure it's there,

20:12.044 --> 20:14.838
- somewhere.
- Zooming out.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.090
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.051
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.469
Zooming out.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.991
I was in bad shape,
then I got too in shape,

20:25.015 --> 20:26.808
now I'm back to normal shape.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.625
Oh, man, Dib, not the coat.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.460
It makes me look mysterious.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.212
Now, step aside.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.130
I've got a Zim to stop.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
All right, test children.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.971
These bracelets are just prototypes,

21:04.054 --> 21:07.432
so try not to breathe or think
while the energy field is...

21:07.516 --> 21:09.434
What? Oh.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.062
Behold, my boy child!

21:12.145 --> 21:13.897
I can't remember the last time

21:13.981 --> 21:16.400
I saw you this excited
about science.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.483
Huh?

21:17.526 --> 21:20.362
My new
Peace Day edition Membracelet.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.699
Tomorrow at my big keynote event,

21:23.782 --> 21:25.742
I reveal it to the world.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.244
And when Peace Day comes,

21:27.327 --> 21:29.413
the children of the Earth
will hold hands and...

21:29.496 --> 21:30.622
Wait a minute.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.582
The alien-hunting briefcase?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.042
Oh, son.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.128
Not this nonsense again.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.840
Dad, trying to save the Earth
from Zim's alien evil

21:39.923 --> 21:41.717
is not nonsense.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.928
Without me, there might not be
an Earth to hold hands around.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.889
Son, there are no aliens.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.643
I've tried to be patient with
your unscientific interests...

21:51.727 --> 21:53.329
...bigfeets, ghosts,

21:53.353 --> 21:54.688
vampire-bees...

21:54.771 --> 21:56.481
You saw those sting marks,

21:56.565 --> 21:58.608
and you know I eat
a lot of honey now.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.695
Well, as a man of science,
I need proof,

22:01.778 --> 22:03.196
and I just haven't seen...

22:03.280 --> 22:05.657
Proof? Proof?

22:07.200 --> 22:09.286
How do you need
more proof than this?

22:09.619 --> 22:12.497
Everything I've collected from
my countless battles with Zim,

22:12.581 --> 22:15.083
from my daring travels
into the unknown things

22:15.167 --> 22:17.961
your science has closed its eyes to.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.172
It makes it very difficult
to get to the lawnmower.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.592
That's Tak's ship,
an alien spaceship

22:23.675 --> 22:26.261
I captured from
one of Zim's alien enemies.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.597
Shouldn't spaceships fly?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.849
It will, as soon
as it lets me fix it.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.394
Dib, your face is stupid.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.605
It's a fine, fake spaceship

22:36.688 --> 22:38.023
you've built there, son, but...

22:38.106 --> 22:39.649
Fake? It's not...

22:40.275 --> 22:42.360
Dad, nobody believes me,

22:42.444 --> 22:44.404
so I'm used to defending
our world on my own,

22:44.488 --> 22:46.865
but I wish, just once,

22:46.948 --> 22:48.366
you'd have my back.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.081
Wishing isn't very scientific, son.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.432
This ends today, Zim!

23:13.016 --> 23:16.561
I'm ready for
everything you got!

23:17.813 --> 23:19.856
<i>Welcome back once again...</i>

23:19.940 --> 23:22.526
- Uh...
<i>- ...countdown to Peace Day...</i>

23:23.068 --> 23:24.611
Intruder!

23:24.694 --> 23:27.280
Prepare to come on in!

23:27.364 --> 23:29.407
<i>I'm Ian Cornish, your host,</i>

23:29.491 --> 23:31.326
<i>on this beautiful, sunny day.</i>

23:31.409 --> 23:34.871
<i>And joining us for our
countdown to Peace Day</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:36.456
<i>is Bloaty the Pig.</i>

23:36.540 --> 23:38.041
<i>What do you have for us, Bloaty?</i>

23:38.125 --> 23:40.794
Hey, Zim's evil robot.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.587
- Where's Zim?
- Mmm-mmm.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.841
<i>This my special pizza</i>

23:45.924 --> 23:49.261
<i>I make just for Peace Day.</i>

23:50.971 --> 23:53.765
<i>It got ten kinds of pizza</i>

23:53.849 --> 23:56.226
<i>inside the pizza,</i>

23:56.309 --> 23:58.520
<i>so that's pretty good.</i>

24:00.814 --> 24:01.940
Where's Zim?

24:02.023 --> 24:03.358
I don't know!

24:03.441 --> 24:05.485
I worry about
that boy so much.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.653
You want some nachos?

24:08.238 --> 24:10.532
Uh, no, thank you.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.659
Hey, keep it down out here.

24:12.742 --> 24:17.289
I'm trying to be miserable
in my cheesy cocoon of misery.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.207
What's going on in here?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.131
What's all this junk?

24:21.459 --> 24:23.461
Yeah, they're all experiments

24:23.545 --> 24:27.632
that I was hoping would be
Phase Two of my plan.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.759
Is that supposed to be my dad?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.595
Oh, hello, son!

24:31.678 --> 24:32.888
Yeah.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.764
I figured he could replace

24:34.848 --> 24:37.851
your actual dad.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.436
And then, I don't know,

24:39.519 --> 24:41.730
ground you forever or something.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.815
I just couldn't get it
to make pudding

24:43.899 --> 24:45.775
the way you love so much.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.611
It ruined the illusion!

24:48.737 --> 24:51.489
I don't love pudding.
What's that smell?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.576
The smell's all me.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.495
What you gonna do about it?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.789
I'm gonna lock you up, is what!

24:59.873 --> 25:01.625
Fine, I don't care.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.794
Wait, really? Why?

25:09.424 --> 25:13.428
This is the flight path
of the Irken Armada.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.096
And there,

25:15.180 --> 25:19.643
shmillions of light years
away from that path

25:19.726 --> 25:21.144
is Earth.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.855
Do you see what this means, human?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.900
That your leaders only fly
in a straight line?

25:26.983 --> 25:29.361
The Tallest aren't coming!

25:30.654 --> 25:33.698
So, you really give up?

25:33.782 --> 25:37.202
I actually finally win?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.581
Earth is safe.

25:45.043 --> 25:49.214
I've lost the respect of My Tallest!

25:49.297 --> 25:50.674
Uh...

25:52.968 --> 25:54.219
Come on, man.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.973
<i>There may come a time
when we at Membrane Labs</i>

25:58.056 --> 26:01.059
<i>stop making the world more amazing.</i>

26:01.142 --> 26:05.063
You know, my dad doesn't respect
what I do, either.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.232
<i>That time is not now.</i>

26:07.315 --> 26:10.819
He thinks I'm crazy
like the rest of the world,

26:10.902 --> 26:13.655
the world I just saved
without anybody knowing.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.157
<i>Tomorrow,
at the Membrane Labs Keynote,</i>

26:16.241 --> 26:18.576
<i>we make history again.</i>

26:18.660 --> 26:21.371
<i>Membrane Labs.
Who wants a better everything?</i>

26:21.454 --> 26:24.374
Wait a minute, the keynote.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.835
Dad's announcing
the new Membracelet tomorrow.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.170
The whole world'll be watching.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.382
If I could somehow take control
of Dad's keynote stream,

26:32.465 --> 26:34.884
I can expose a real alien, you,

26:34.968 --> 26:37.387
live in front of the entire planet.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.577
I believe you, Dib.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.979
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.119
Whoo! Yeah, yeah!

27:01.202 --> 27:04.497
You just might still
be good for something, Zim.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.583
What do you say?

27:06.666 --> 27:08.084
Fine. I don't care.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.306
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:22.307 --> 27:25.268
I am so very proud
to announce...

27:27.812 --> 27:30.315
the new Peace Day edition

27:30.398 --> 27:32.442
Membracelet!

27:39.741 --> 27:41.409
Dib,

27:41.493 --> 27:43.536
why is Zim here?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.080
Don't worry about it, Gaz.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.207
It's... I'll explain later.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.376
This is Dad's big night.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.295
Don't even think of doing
anything dumb, or...

27:52.379 --> 27:55.340
Gaz, don't worry. Just go.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.966
Enjoy the show.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.053
I'm sure it's gonna be something special.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.947
Whew. Okay, Zim.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.783
Did you use your alien stuff
to take over the control room?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.660
Oh, yeah.
Give me a minute.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.717
<i>...apps such as Peanut Simulator...</i>

28:39.801 --> 28:41.719
I updated your bracelet.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.239
Just hit that button,

28:43.263 --> 28:46.057
and you'll be in control
of everything.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.767
Is this update squeaking?

28:47.851 --> 28:49.227
I guess so.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.687
I can't believe I'm saying it,

28:50.770 --> 28:53.857
but this is your greatest work ever.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.109
Eh.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.695
As you know,
tomorrow is Peace Day,

28:58.778 --> 29:03.158
and nobody is as excited for
the big celebration as I am.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.409
I am!

29:04.492 --> 29:07.120
Not scientifically possible!

29:08.955 --> 29:11.458
Children. We discovered they generate

29:11.541 --> 29:14.544
an energy field of limitless,
chaotic potential.

29:14.627 --> 29:18.381
We call that child energy "Childergy."

29:18.465 --> 29:21.259
The new Membracelet
harnesses that childergy

29:21.342 --> 29:25.013
and channels it outward
as pure peace and joy.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.973
- Ooh.
- Tomorrow,

29:27.056 --> 29:29.058
children will hold hands...

29:29.142 --> 29:32.020
...encircling the planet
in Membracelets

29:32.103 --> 29:34.814
to bring about a peace
unlike any

29:34.898 --> 29:37.859
the world has ever known.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.403
Get ready to see the truth, world,

29:40.487 --> 29:41.696
but specifically, Dad.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.076
Huh?

30:00.298 --> 30:02.050
Oh, no.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.180
Greetings, fellow humans.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.557
Zim? Wait, what?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.017
Where's my dad?

30:11.684 --> 30:15.021
I'm, eh, Professor Zim.

30:15.104 --> 30:19.984
Oh, so that other guy just retired
and put me in charge,

30:20.068 --> 30:24.364
and I just made some
exciting new changes to the bracelet.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.492
- Eww!
- No!

30:27.575 --> 30:29.744
Wait! Zim's an alien!

30:29.828 --> 30:30.995
No!

30:31.079 --> 30:33.081
He...

30:36.292 --> 30:37.812
<i>He's so cool.</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:40.255
<i>We should all do
everything he says,</i>

30:40.338 --> 30:43.341
<i>no matter how evil it sounds.</i>

30:43.883 --> 30:46.177
<i>Hail Zim!</i>

30:48.721 --> 30:51.599
Yes, be joyous, you fools.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.226
Buy my bracelet,

30:53.309 --> 30:56.688
and get ready for
the most peaceful Peace Day

30:56.771 --> 31:00.483
your grotesque eyeballs
have ever seen!

31:02.861 --> 31:04.779
The bracelet comes in four colors!

31:24.048 --> 31:26.301
No!

31:31.139 --> 31:33.391
Please say that was
just a horrible nightmare.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.143
- Son!
- Dad?

31:35.602 --> 31:37.228
Breakfast is ready.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.356
Yes! Yes!

31:40.440 --> 31:41.733
Yes, yes!

31:41.816 --> 31:44.319
Good morning, Da...

31:44.402 --> 31:45.987
Oh, no!

31:46.070 --> 31:47.864
Happy Peace Day, son!

31:47.947 --> 31:49.866
You is grounded forever.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.330
Bweakfast is da most
science-y meal of da day.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.208
<i>♪ Doop, doop, doop
Doop, doop, doop, do ♪</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:02.837
Pudding.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.548
If Foodio 3000 could just perhaps...

32:05.632 --> 32:08.509
No, foody guy!
I taking care of it.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.556
These my kids
and science and stuff.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.142
Gaz, I'm so sorry.
Zim tricked me.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.453
I didn't mean for any of this to...

32:17.477 --> 32:18.895
What?

32:18.978 --> 32:21.230
You didn't mean
to ruin Dad's big show,

32:21.314 --> 32:23.524
get him kidnapped,
and hand Zim the keys

32:23.608 --> 32:26.486
to Membrane Labs
while you and I are held prisoner

32:26.569 --> 32:28.988
by something that looks like
Dad having an allergic reaction

32:29.072 --> 32:31.741
to radioactive bees?

32:31.824 --> 32:34.243
Eh, something the matter, honey?

32:34.327 --> 32:36.496
Nah, it's cool, Dad.

32:36.913 --> 32:40.041
How can you be so calm?
That thing isn't Dad.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.877
- Yeah, look.
- Just go along with...

32:42.961 --> 32:44.671
You're not our dad!

32:44.754 --> 32:46.464
Oh, man, here we go.

32:46.547 --> 32:50.134
That's a terrible thing
to say, son.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.518
Oh, Dib, always kidding.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.062
Of course, he's our dad.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.481
Great breakfast, Dad.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.483
Is it good pudding?

33:05.566 --> 33:07.806
It's the worst pudding
I've ever had in my life.

33:08.903 --> 33:10.071
Thanks, honey.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.074
It's not easy taking care
of two kids on my own...

33:13.157 --> 33:16.911
It's so rewarding.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.955
You're a clone.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.541
Our real dad's been kidnapped by Zim.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.252
Son, it not nice to say bad things

33:24.335 --> 33:26.087
about your best friend.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.672
Zim is not my best friend.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.008
- He's wonderful.
- No, he's the worst.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.426
- You love Zim?
- No!

33:31.509 --> 33:33.052
I hate him! He's the most...

33:33.136 --> 33:34.220
I love Zim.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.118
We need to get out of here.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.561
And find Dad, but Clembrane's fast.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.271
- Clembrane?
- Clone, membrane.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.315
And yeah, I already tried
busting out every possible way.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.233
No luck.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.818
You tried escaping without me?

33:48.901 --> 33:50.403
Let's focus on the now, Dib.

33:50.486 --> 33:53.114
Every move I made,
he was there to stop me.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.407
Remember, kids,

33:54.490 --> 33:57.744
I'm here for you if you ever
need to talk about stuff...

34:00.204 --> 34:02.165
Stay in school.
Brush your teeth.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.833
That's good advice, Dad.

34:03.916 --> 34:06.377
Ooh, it's time for Peace Day now!

34:11.215 --> 34:13.801
<i>If you're just tuning in
to our Peace Day coverage...</i>

34:14.802 --> 34:17.429
<i>...you're watching Zim,
the new head of Membrane Labs,</i>

34:17.513 --> 34:20.933
<i>personally overseeing the sale
of his new Membracelet</i>

34:21.016 --> 34:23.518
<i>from one of the new mobile M-Labs Stores</i>

34:23.603 --> 34:25.563
<i>deployed all around the world.</i>

34:28.024 --> 34:29.567
Yeah!

34:29.650 --> 34:31.569
Yeah!

34:42.288 --> 34:45.583
So, this show is just
Zim laughing the whole time?

34:47.502 --> 34:48.920
<i>And that concludes</i>

34:49.003 --> 34:51.047
<i>the laughing portion
of the program.</i>

34:51.130 --> 34:53.507
People of Earth,
of which I am one,

34:53.591 --> 34:56.010
because I am human
and inferior and disgusting

34:56.094 --> 34:58.930
just like you are,
Happy Peace Day!

35:01.224 --> 35:03.559
My amazing new Peace Day Bracelet

35:03.643 --> 35:05.311
is a huge success!

35:06.187 --> 35:08.898
You, barely sentient bag
of meat and juice,

35:08.981 --> 35:10.817
what do you think
of my new bracelet?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.235
I love it!

35:12.693 --> 35:16.781
It's a lot more alive
than I expected, though.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.534
It sure is.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.994
Already, children around the world

35:22.078 --> 35:24.622
are beginning to hold hands.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.876
Soon, the ring of children
will connect right here,

35:28.960 --> 35:32.922
and my greatest plan
shall be revealed!

35:37.885 --> 35:39.765
<i>He really does seem
to love his job.</i>

35:41.013 --> 35:43.766
Wait a minute.
That place looks familiar.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.309
Is that...

35:48.187 --> 35:49.480
Zim!

35:50.189 --> 35:52.191
Get off my lawn!

35:52.608 --> 35:54.235
Hi, Dib!

35:54.318 --> 35:56.654
What are you doing here?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.906
I live here!

35:58.990 --> 36:02.076
You're gonna have to speak up!

36:02.160 --> 36:04.704
You won't get away with this!

36:05.079 --> 36:06.164
What?

36:06.581 --> 36:08.791
- You won't get a...
- What?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.960
- You won't get awa...
- What?

36:11.043 --> 36:14.255
- You won't get away...
- What?

36:14.338 --> 36:16.174
- You...
- What?

36:16.257 --> 36:20.219
Dib, check out how huge
your head looks on TV.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.098
I'm here for you, buddy.
Come here.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.518
<i>Work harder, children.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:29.437
<i>Harder!</i>

36:29.520 --> 36:32.231
<i>Don't you want world peace?</i>

36:32.315 --> 36:34.317
<i>Work harder for Zim.</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:40.031
<i>Hi, Dib.</i>

36:42.617 --> 36:44.035
Look at them, GIR.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.954
All this time
trying to subjugate the humans,

36:47.038 --> 36:49.373
and all I had to do
was charge them for it.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.499
Mmm-hmm.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.211
But the children of Earth
are letting me down.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.631
I need you to use the power
of your Irken robot brain

36:56.714 --> 36:59.175
to create a song about peace.

36:59.258 --> 37:04.889
One so inspiring, the children will have
no choice but to peace harder!

37:04.972 --> 37:06.390
Like this?

37:20.154 --> 37:22.365
- Mmm-hmm?
- No, GIR.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.533
Try again.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.327
Oh.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.912
I think I know.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.589

Zim's done something to the bracelets!

39:01.839 --> 39:03.549
Don't hold hands!

39:03.632 --> 39:06.552
Relax. It's Zim we're talking about.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.722
Whatever he's got planned,
it's not gonna work.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.999
No!

39:52.681 --> 39:55.434
Ha! Nothing happened, Zim!

39:55.893 --> 39:58.854
Of course nothing happened, human.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.690
It's not enough
to simply attach

40:01.774 --> 40:04.443
a space-phasing
alien horror blob

40:04.527 --> 40:05.820
to these bracelets.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.823
"Space phasing"?

40:08.906 --> 40:12.493
You'd also need something
with the power to harness

40:12.576 --> 40:14.995
the dark energy of space

40:15.079 --> 40:16.789
to activate them.

Look at me being wrong.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.353
What have you done, Zim?

41:23.814 --> 41:26.859
I've teleported the Earth
to a part of space

41:26.942 --> 41:30.905
directly in the path
of the Irken Armada.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.657
Now The Tallest
have to visit me next.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.035
- Where's our dad?
- You what?

41:36.118 --> 41:39.205
I can't believe I fell for
your sad, shmoopy act!

41:39.288 --> 41:41.248
My shmoop was no act.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.792
I truly felt I had failed The Tallest,

41:43.876 --> 41:46.962
but then you told me
about the power of the bracelet,

41:47.046 --> 41:49.548
inspiring me.
It's funny, really.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.592
Laughter, GIR.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.636
And I owe it all to...

41:54.553 --> 41:56.222
I smell pudding.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.518
...to you!

42:04.563 --> 42:05.689
Eh?

42:11.779 --> 42:14.615
Is that part of your brilliant plan, Zim?

42:14.698 --> 42:16.158
Eh, probably.

42:16.242 --> 42:19.620
I mean, I'm so incredible,
even I don't know everything I do.

42:19.703 --> 42:23.415
Computer, what is that thing
in space that just happened?

42:23.499 --> 42:25.042
Thing is a Florpus Hole

42:25.125 --> 42:28.921
created by the incredibly stupid
teleportation of an entire planet.

42:29.004 --> 42:32.841
And is "Florpus Hole"
as cool as it sounds?

42:32.925 --> 42:35.803
Florpus Hole will suck in
all nearby worlds,

42:35.886 --> 42:39.515
wherein they will collide violently
with alternate realities.

42:40.015 --> 42:42.643
There, you see?
It's just a shmorpus hole.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.980
Besides, The Tallest'll get here
long before there's any trouble.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.024
Zim, that Florpus
is gonna destroy the Earth,

42:49.108 --> 42:50.234
you included!

42:50.317 --> 42:52.611
If you're so worried
about the Florpus,

42:52.695 --> 42:54.405
just get your dad to help.

42:54.488 --> 42:56.615
I'm over here, everybody.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.618
He's only a shmillion light years away

42:59.702 --> 43:02.830
on Moo-Ping 10,
also known as

43:02.913 --> 43:05.332
Space Prison!

43:06.333 --> 43:09.670
Why don't you hop in your spaceship
and go rescue him?

43:09.753 --> 43:11.922
Oh, wait,
you don't have a spaceship!

43:12.006 --> 43:14.341
Lawrence!

43:14.425 --> 43:15.801
Now, if you'll excuse me,

43:15.884 --> 43:18.929
I've got some Tall company
on the way.

43:19.763 --> 43:22.558
Zim!

43:25.227 --> 43:26.437
My Tallest?

43:27.021 --> 43:30.190
Something appears to have
appeared in our path.

43:31.358 --> 43:32.568
What is it?

43:32.651 --> 43:35.279
A terrifying, deadly space anomaly.

43:35.362 --> 43:37.573
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, interesting.
- Mmm, yeah, okay.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.116
As well as the planet Earth.

43:42.786 --> 43:45.247
Earth? That means Zim!

43:45.331 --> 43:47.416
This is the worst news
I've ever heard.

43:47.499 --> 43:50.961
Sirs, we still have quite
a bit of time to change course.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.589
But we're going straight.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.716
Yeah. Turning's no fun.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.134
Why is this happening?

43:57.217 --> 43:58.802
Make it not happen.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.480
It's been ten years, Gaz.

44:10.272 --> 44:14.360
Ten long years trapped in this house
with the pudding monster.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.695
It's been two days, but yeah.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.114
How come you kids don't play
with the science puppy

44:19.198 --> 44:20.699
I made for you?

44:20.783 --> 44:22.385
Because it's pudding.

44:22.409 --> 44:24.203
I hate this
as much as you do,

44:24.286 --> 44:27.331
but it's not like anyone can
just walk out the front door.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.654
<i>♪ Doop, bee, doop, doop
Doop, doop, bee, doop ♪</i>

44:29.708 --> 44:31.335
<i>♪ Doop, doop
Doop, bee, doop ♪</i>

44:35.756 --> 44:38.175
<i>♪ Doop, bee, doop
Doop, doop, doop, bee, doop ♪</i>

44:38.258 --> 44:40.052
<i>♪ Doop, doop, doop
Bee, doop, doop ♪</i>

44:41.970 --> 44:45.474
Okay, it's not like we can
just walk out the front door,

44:45.557 --> 44:47.810
but maybe we can... Hmm.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.228
Hey, Dad.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.774
Stop calling him "Dad!"

44:54.358 --> 44:57.528
<i>Now, pay close attention
to that ham,</i>

44:57.611 --> 44:59.446
<i>'cause it's not the last time</i>

44:59.530 --> 45:02.408
<i>you're gonna see that ham
in the story.</i>

45:02.491 --> 45:04.493
Dad,

45:04.576 --> 45:06.954
you and Dib need more
father-son time together.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.914
Just look at him.
He's all messed up,

45:08.997 --> 45:10.707
needs more
quality time with you.

45:10.791 --> 45:13.001
Ooh, I see what you mean.

45:13.085 --> 45:14.878
You got any suggestions?

45:15.421 --> 45:16.713
Hmm.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.013
This was a good idea, honey.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.933
Science projects bring families together.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.643
How can I help you, son?

45:29.726 --> 45:32.563
You need me to put
some science pudding on it?

45:33.522 --> 45:35.149
Uh, maybe later.

45:35.232 --> 45:38.360
You just keep stirring, uh, Dad.

45:40.487 --> 45:43.740
Whoa.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.409
Festering human,

45:45.492 --> 45:48.745
you have stolen me away
from my rightful owner!

45:48.829 --> 45:50.998
Look, ship, I get that
you don't like me and all,

45:51.081 --> 45:52.207
but we need your help.

45:52.291 --> 45:55.127
I don't help anyone but Tak.

45:55.210 --> 45:57.421
See? It's no use.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.674
- You hate Dib, right?
- Affirmative.

46:00.757 --> 46:02.968
But you hate Zim even more.

46:03.051 --> 46:04.051
Correct.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.846
I see where
you're going with this.

46:05.929 --> 46:08.599
Helping us break our dad
out of Moopington would...

46:08.682 --> 46:11.518
Wait, do you mean
Moo-Ping 10?

46:12.019 --> 46:13.019
Right.

46:13.061 --> 46:15.606
It would make Zim
super unhappy.

46:15.689 --> 46:18.358
Flawless logic.
I will help you.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.485
Yes!

46:19.568 --> 46:21.653
- On one condition.
- What's that?

46:21.737 --> 46:23.489
Disconnect my seat sensors

46:23.572 --> 46:26.283
so I don't feel your
terrible human butts in me.

46:26.533 --> 46:27.533
Deal.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.926
We did it, kids.
Hurray for science.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.054
Right. Now, about that pudding...

46:49.306 --> 46:52.643
Don't wait up for us, Clembrane!

46:58.148 --> 47:00.317
Yeah!

47:07.783 --> 47:09.427
<i>Oh.</i>

47:09.451 --> 47:11.161
You guys have a deadly Florpus Hole now.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.955
- That's new.
- Yeah.

47:13.038 --> 47:14.599
- Let's hurry, ship.
- Don't tell me what to do.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.624
But okay.

47:19.044 --> 47:21.547
Now, this is what
I like to see, GIR.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.799
Pathetic humans fleeing in terror

47:23.882 --> 47:25.008
at the sight of Zim!

47:25.759 --> 47:27.719
Nobody even looking at you.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.656
It's a show of respect.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.224
Their stupid eyes can't handle all this.

47:36.311 --> 47:38.814
Anyhow, terrible work on the signs, GIR,

47:38.897 --> 47:40.732
worse than I expected.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.318
Aww, thank you.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.529
Did you build me
that throne I asked for?

47:45.612 --> 47:47.364
Mmm-hmm.

47:59.793 --> 48:01.169
Excellent.

48:02.087 --> 48:04.715
Now, to ascend this throne,

48:04.798 --> 48:06.633
and claim my rightful place as...

48:11.638 --> 48:13.932
Hah! But where are the flames?

48:14.016 --> 48:17.603
I can't rule the world without cool flames
shooting up behind me.

48:19.521 --> 48:21.315
Hit the flames button!

48:21.732 --> 48:23.775
Hmm? Ah-ha!

48:28.488 --> 48:29.906
Wait, are those peanuts?

48:29.990 --> 48:31.450
Oops.

48:31.825 --> 48:34.828
Try the peanuts button.

48:34.911 --> 48:37.706
All right,
flames, uh, peanuts,

48:37.789 --> 48:38.957
flames, uh, peanuts?

48:39.041 --> 48:40.375
Oh!

48:45.130 --> 48:46.256
Hmm?

48:53.555 --> 48:55.474
The peanuts!

48:55.557 --> 48:58.518
Oh, whoa, whoa.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.856
The Tallest will be so happy!

49:02.939 --> 49:06.943
We're so unhappy!

49:07.027 --> 49:09.821
Zim's so close,
I can almost smell him.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.282
Sirs, really, it's no big deal.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.992
We can just steer around the...

49:14.076 --> 49:16.787
Wait, why steer around the Earth

49:16.870 --> 49:18.664
when we can just blow it up?

49:18.747 --> 49:21.124
Yeah, we're great at blowing stuff up.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.408
What is that?

49:22.834 --> 49:24.961
- It appears to be a...
- Blow it up!

49:28.090 --> 49:31.134
But, sirs,
there's still the life-destroying

49:31.218 --> 49:32.594
space hole to consider.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.137
Man, this guy.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.639
"I fly the spaceship,

49:35.722 --> 49:37.891
and I sure love steering!"

49:37.974 --> 49:38.974
Yeah.

49:39.017 --> 49:41.937
"Ooh, look at me
steering all over the place.

49:42.020 --> 49:44.981
Look at me steering with
my wittle steering hands."

49:46.483 --> 49:48.235
I like that we're funny.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.327
Hey!

49:57.411 --> 49:59.788
Your noises are bad.
Also, we're here.

50:01.206 --> 50:03.083
Moo-Ping 10,

50:03.166 --> 50:06.586
prison to the galaxy's
most infamous criminals.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.633
Okay, their defenses
are about to go down.

50:11.717 --> 50:12.843
How do you know?

50:12.926 --> 50:14.261
Just get ready.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.020
All right, now what?

50:24.104 --> 50:25.790
I'll go cause a diversion
and come back

50:25.814 --> 50:26.940
when you've found your dog.

50:27.023 --> 50:28.525
- Our dad.
- Whatever.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.953
That's our diversion.
You ready?

50:40.036 --> 50:41.621
I was born ready, Gaz.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.373
This spy coat isn't just to look cool.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.801
Now we'll never find Dad!

50:58.555 --> 51:01.266
Oh, uh,

51:01.349 --> 51:04.102
normally, you crying
on the floor is hilarious,

51:04.186 --> 51:05.437
but come on.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.273
It's all my fault, Gaz.

51:08.356 --> 51:10.567
Why aren't you saying
I told you so?

51:11.109 --> 51:14.488
'Cause making fun of you
is no fun when you're this sad.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.323
You're my brother, man.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.493
I only torment you
because I know you can handle it.

51:19.576 --> 51:22.287
I've done way worse
than throwing you in a space prison.

51:22.370 --> 51:24.623
This is nothing.
Get up!

51:26.875 --> 51:28.877
I was supposed to save the world, Gaz,

51:28.960 --> 51:31.004
not help Zim destroy it.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.799
I was gonna show people the truth.

51:34.341 --> 51:37.135
I knew if they saw
something amazing,

51:37.219 --> 51:39.346
even if it was horrible,
like Zim,

51:39.429 --> 51:41.306
people would just wake up,

51:41.389 --> 51:43.934
and stop obsessing
over all the little things

51:44.017 --> 51:47.020
and see that there was
something bigger out there,

51:47.103 --> 51:49.314
something to unite against.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.400
Instead of fighting each other,

51:52.484 --> 51:54.820
the world would know
there was...

51:54.903 --> 51:56.404
Hey, Dib!
Shut up and look!

51:58.240 --> 52:00.534
- Dad!
- Son!

52:00.617 --> 52:01.719
- Aww!
- I didn't want to

52:01.743 --> 52:03.912
interrupt your lovely, imaginary speech.

52:03.995 --> 52:04.995
Imaginary?

52:05.038 --> 52:07.541
Well, the last thing
I remember was something

52:07.624 --> 52:08.959
hitting me on the head

52:09.042 --> 52:11.962
and starting
this incredible hallucination.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.965
No, this is all really happening.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.175
Zim used your bracelets
to teleport the Earth

52:17.259 --> 52:18.802
to another part
of the universe!

52:18.885 --> 52:20.136
Do you know how?

52:20.220 --> 52:21.680
Uh, he's not gonna know how.

52:21.763 --> 52:24.200
Son, the Membracelet
is just for running apps

52:24.224 --> 52:27.602
and world peace,
but, oh, theoretically...

52:27.686 --> 52:30.272
...one could use it to, say,

52:30.355 --> 52:33.567
create a galactic star gate of sorts, yes.

52:34.317 --> 52:36.361
What?

52:36.444 --> 52:39.656
That's crazy, yo.

52:41.157 --> 52:42.826
Well, we knew it was possible,

52:42.909 --> 52:46.329
but only with the addition
of a purely theoretical

52:46.413 --> 52:51.251
alien horror blob energized
by a purely theoretical

52:51.334 --> 52:53.420
tiny purple space moose.

52:53.503 --> 52:54.880
But all those things don't exist,

52:54.963 --> 52:56.631
so we didn't worry about it.

52:56.715 --> 52:57.799
Minimoose!

52:58.216 --> 53:00.176
Dad, if you had that purple space moose,

53:00.260 --> 53:01.740
could you use it
to teleport the Earth

53:01.803 --> 53:03.054
back where it belongs?

53:03.138 --> 53:04.931
Theoretically, mmm-hmm.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.933
Too bad we're in prison.

53:10.687 --> 53:12.606
Three human butts is too many,

53:12.689 --> 53:14.024
so I brought this.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.442
Hop in.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.402
This is all so real!

53:17.485 --> 53:19.195
- Not a hallucination.
- Shotgun!

53:22.574 --> 53:24.492
See you later!

53:24.576 --> 53:27.621
Only enough room in there
for you guys, I guess.

53:29.915 --> 53:31.750
Yay!

53:31.833 --> 53:34.711
Hang on
to your disgusting butts!

53:34.794 --> 53:36.296
What's with you and butts?

53:41.885 --> 53:44.804
Okay, okay.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.389
Okay, enough running and screaming.

53:46.473 --> 53:47.891
Let's mix it up a bit.

53:47.974 --> 53:50.518
Maybe bow down before me or something.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.400
Hmm, leaping is good.

54:00.570 --> 54:03.698
Well, that was very convincing.

54:03.782 --> 54:05.867
Because it's real, Dad!

54:05.951 --> 54:08.787
How could
anything that horrifying be real?

54:18.338 --> 54:20.507
Dad, the Earth's minutes away
from being destroyed!

54:20.590 --> 54:21.841
Why are you laughing?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.653
Minimoose is a funny name.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.699
Normally, I'd say
"Don't touch me,"

54:28.723 --> 54:30.433
but maybe a little help?

54:54.582 --> 54:55.792
Huh?

55:03.049 --> 55:05.009
This isn't good.

55:08.638 --> 55:10.265
Gaz!

55:22.736 --> 55:23.611
Marvelous!

55:24.612 --> 55:28.366
I truly believe
I'm falling to a hideous death!

55:28.450 --> 55:30.785
Hang on, Dad!

55:30.869 --> 55:32.746
Don't let go!

55:32.829 --> 55:35.832
Don't worry.
None of this is real.

55:35.915 --> 55:38.626
I'll prove everything to you.

55:38.710 --> 55:40.420
Just hang on!

55:40.795 --> 55:43.590
You'll be proud of me!

55:43.673 --> 55:46.926
Son,
you don't have to prove anything.

55:47.510 --> 55:49.763
I'm always proud of you.

55:52.807 --> 55:55.852
Dad!

55:57.270 --> 55:58.605
I did it, GIR.

55:58.688 --> 56:02.776
The humans cower in fear
before my superior Irken might,

56:02.859 --> 56:04.486
and just in time.

56:04.569 --> 56:06.446
Is that The Tallest
I see approa...

56:17.373 --> 56:18.373
Dib?

56:20.668 --> 56:21.920
You...

56:23.963 --> 56:26.132
Give me the moose.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.274
Huh? Huh? Huh?

56:45.193 --> 56:47.403
Zim, that moose is the only thing

56:47.487 --> 56:50.031
that can save Earth
from your Florpus!

56:50.115 --> 56:51.991
Get your own moose, human!

56:52.075 --> 56:53.785
This one's mine!

56:53.868 --> 56:55.995
Hah, I think you're cool too, Minimoose.

57:15.682 --> 57:18.434
Stop! We're running out of time!

57:18.518 --> 57:20.854
You're ugly when you lie, Dib!

57:20.937 --> 57:22.480
I'm not lying!

57:22.564 --> 57:24.566
Then why are you ugly?

57:48.631 --> 57:49.507
- Give me the moose.
- No!

57:49.591 --> 57:50.592
- Give me the moose.
- No!

57:50.675 --> 57:51.675
- Give me the moose.
- No!

57:52.051 --> 57:54.846
I liked you better
when you were a chair!

57:54.929 --> 57:58.433
And I liked you better
when you were a toilet!

57:58.516 --> 58:01.394
I was not a toilet!

58:04.898 --> 58:06.900
Leprechaun cat, no...

58:11.696 --> 58:13.865
I was hiding in the toilet.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.331
Hmm?

58:37.305 --> 58:38.640
Zim!

58:38.723 --> 58:41.100
No!

58:47.982 --> 58:49.025
Well, he's dead.

58:49.108 --> 58:51.569
GIR, all this evil is doing
a number on my throat.

58:51.653 --> 58:55.532
Fetch me a soothing lozenge!

58:55.615 --> 58:56.783
Huh?

59:23.393 --> 59:24.394
Dad!

59:33.361 --> 59:35.572
Why are you wearing those shirts?

59:37.365 --> 59:40.410
I never hired any of you!

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.016
Don't worry, son.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.642
I've got your back.

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:24.245
Spencer! Devon!

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.540
- Maria!
- Come on!

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.667
Lawrence!

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.003
No!

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:33.921
Ah-ha!

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:41.888
GIR, avenge your robot brothers and Maria.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.348
Yes, my master!

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.194
You're terrible, GIR!

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.238
It's over, Zim.

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:02.200
Oh, it is?

01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:03.701
Well, now I'm sad. Wait!

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:05.328
Have you forgotten?

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:07.997
You're grounded!

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.081
Uh-oh.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:13.753
And you, get away from my son!

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.171
Uh...

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.340
...what's happening?

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.008
What is this thing?

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.219
- He's you, Dad.
- What?

01:01:21.302 --> 01:01:23.888
Who's me, son? I'm me.

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.182
But who's that? Pudding break.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.435
I'm very confused right now.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.605
So, it has been revealed.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.775
You've discovered the clone
is not actually

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.403
your real father!

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.199
You told me he wasn't my real father.

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.200
Pudding break over.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.003
Oh, this feels so real!

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.287
We need that moose, Dad!

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.165
Nothing's uglier
than moose jealousy, Dib.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.584
Ooh, what the... Where did...

01:01:56.295 --> 01:01:58.047
Yours is the worst...

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:02.260
butt of them...
butt of them all, Zim.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.886
Dib!

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:08.349
Do you still have
that ham I gave you?

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.059
Of course!

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.270
The ham!

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:16.858
<i>See?
There's that ham again.</i>

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:27.994
Ham!

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.500
Great work, honey, but...

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:37.837
Oops.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.424
Honey, fighting doodn't solve anything.

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:43.509
Also, I found this little moose thing.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.136
Look at it. Isn't it funny?

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.347
I command you
to return the moose

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.100
and destroy
the Membrane family!

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.437
But... they my family.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.773
And that guy,

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.484
it's like looking into a mirror.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.003
Oh, I don't know about...

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.654
I should've known you'd fail me!

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.657
You couldn't even learn
to make pudding the right way.

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:12.038
Hey! You leave Clembrane alone!

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.122
Yeah!

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.750
It's the best pudding I've ever had

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.794
in my life.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:31.891
Excellent. Now, just...

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:36.020
No!

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:41.651
It's happening!

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:44.070
Use the moose!

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.697
Uh, right.
Use the moose.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.741
Um, okay.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:52.370
Everyone, hold hands again.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:56.374
Yeah!
Your lives depend on it!

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:58.876
Okay! Hold my hand.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.128
No way! Be serious!

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:04.465
Now, come on, everyone. Faster!

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:08.302
I did my best.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.304
It's no use, Dib.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.597
You've lost.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:15.726
The Irken Armada is already here.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.813
Forward cannons now at full power.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.901
Almost have it.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.280
Dad, hurry!

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.783
We're entering the Florpus!

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.961
Zim has won!

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.885
No pressure, Dad,

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.887
but...

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.558
Cut me some slack!
This is my first moose!

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.143
Relax.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.704
It's just realities colliding

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.062
like my computer said.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:03.733
And tearing
Earth apart, you moron!

01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:14.827
Hmm, um...

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:23.711
Um, um, uh, eh. Oh.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.566
Uh, there...

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.133
Oh, no.

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:40.770
I've got it!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.921
My Tallest, the Earth...

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:08.422
It's gone.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.092
That's great news.

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:13.886
- Crisis averted.
- Hurray!

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.055
Now we don't have to turn.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:20.059
Sirs, there's still
the horrifying space hole

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.352
straight ahead.

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:23.979
Why are you so negative?

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.650
Yay!
Whoo-hoo!

01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:30.014
Yeah...

01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:43.207
Now,
prepare your eating faces

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.793
for incalculable nutrition!

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.424
Good work, Foodio.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.175
Thank you, Gazlene.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:56.470
I hope you can taste
the love simulation I made it with.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.274
Just one final ingwedient.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:06.147
Family and pudding
and science and wobots and stuff.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.525
So, does he live here now or what?

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:11.402
I'm still very confused.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:20.327
Enjoying your losers' meal,
eh, Dib?

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:23.164
"Losers"? Your plan failed.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:25.666
Did it, Dib? Did it?

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.252
What if I told you
my plan all along

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:32.256
was to steal
this whatever-it-is?

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:34.091
Phase Two.
It was Phase Two all along.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.969
Is that the ceramic clown puppy
from our living room?

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.055
Who's laughing now, Dib?

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.894
I am, see?

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.371
Why didn't you invite

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.065
your little green friend
in for dinner, son?

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.775
Dad, that was Zim,

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.319
the alien who almost destroyed
the world, remember?

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:56.447
Son, of course I remember.

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.076
I remember
getting hit on the head

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.953
and dreaming up
all that crazy stuff.

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:04.370
What?

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:07.124
What's happening?
Is everything over?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.835
Yes, GIR, I'm just waiting for The Tallest

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.547
to answer this call so I can
tell them all about my success.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:16.175
Did we win?
Did we win?

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:19.053
Did we win?
Did we win?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.845
Did we win?
Did we win?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.182
Did we win?
Did we win?

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.560
Did we win?
Did we win?

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:29.604
Did we win?

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.109
Of course. Zim always wins...

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.868
No thanks to you
working with the enemy.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.246
Heh, good one, Minimoose.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.331
I can't stay mad at you.

01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:48.707
Ah, here we go.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.917
My Tallest,
I am pleased to report

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:55.464
my plan was a success and I now
have Dib's puppy clown thing,

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.716
which was my plan all along.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.051
Does this please you?

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.483
That sounded like a yes to me.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:21.948
Yay! I missed you so much!
