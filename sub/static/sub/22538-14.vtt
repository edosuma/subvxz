SPINY ANTEATERS, EVEN SOME RODENTS...

00:36.850 --> 00:39.710

00:39.770 --> 00:41.020
HER NAME'S VALERIE PALMER.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.460
SHE'S AN AIR HOSTESS FOR PAN ATLANTIC.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.040

00:46.100 --> 00:49.120
TWO STEWS. COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK,ANOTHER GIRL GOT DEAD-

CASH AND CARDS STILL THERE.

00:59.080 --> 01:02.570
WITNESS SAW A MAN RUNNING NORTH WEARING A MASK.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.260
-WHAT KIND OF MASK? -A SKI MASK.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.100
SHE'S NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR. WE SHOULD GET A RAPE KIT. A WHAT KIT?

01:12.820 --> 01:14.270
OH,WE FOUND HER FLIGHT CASE,TOO.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.290
HER DIARY WAS IN THERE WITH HER CLOTHES AND STUFF.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.060
READ IT.

01:19.590 --> 01:20.230
REALLY?

01:22.220 --> 01:23.150
IT'S HER DIARY.

01:23.740 --> 01:24.750
CHRIS,SHE'S DEAD.

01:25.190 --> 01:29.880
-HER DIARY MIGHT TELL US WHO WANTED HER THAT WAY. -BEARS MADE HIBERNATION FAMOUS,BUT BATS HIBERNATE,TOO!

01:29.930 --> 01:32.350
AND THE HIBERNATION KEEPS GOING AND GOING D GOING.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.720
HIBERNATION'S SO IMPORTANT FOR MANY SPECIES... OHH.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.270
WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU FLY THIS GIRL BEFORE THERE,SPACEMAN?

01:39.060 --> 01:40.020
HOLY COW.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.320
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

01:45.090 --> 01:45.750
WHAT IS IT?

01:46.530 --> 01:47.220
ANNIE.

01:48.370 --> 01:49.930
ANNIE,YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.590
<i>THIS IS REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.</i>

02:01.490 --> 02:03.350
IT'S LIKE SHE COULD BE YOUR TWIN.

02:06.610 --> 02:07.920
<i>MY NAME IS SAM TYLER.</i>

02:08.570 --> 02:11.710
<i>I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT, AND I WOKE UP IN 1973.</i>

02:12.190 --> 02:13.800
<i>I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY I'M HERE,</i>

02:14.280 --> 02:15.320
<i>BUT WHATEVER'S HAPPENED,</i>

02:15.420 --> 02:17.580
<i>IT'S LIKE I'VE LANDED ON A DIFFERENT PLANET.</i>

02:17.660 --> 02:21.610
<i>NOW MAYBE IF I CAN WORK OUT THE REASON,I CAN GET HOME.</i>

02:37.670 --> 02:38.910
ANNIE,YOU OKAY?

02:38.970 --> 02:41.300
UM... MM,NOT REALLY.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.890
NOT REALLY AT ALL.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.770
LISTEN,THAT- ERE'S NO EXPLANATION...

02:45.850 --> 02:47.860
THAT OCCURS TO ME FOR THIS.

02:47.940 --> 02:50.420
WELL,AS A MAN WHO IS INTIMATELY FAMILIAR

02:50.490 --> 02:53.430
WITH UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON, I WOULDN'T OVERTHINK IT.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.310
OVERTHINK IT?

03:03.190 --> 03:04.490
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE LATELY

03:04.550 --> 03:06.080
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THINGS

03:06.150 --> 03:07.410
THAT DON'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.550
YOU SAY YOU'RE FROM THE FUTURE.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.150
AND YOUR MOTHER- WELL,SHE'S MY AGE.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.140
AND YOUR FATHER?

03:16.600 --> 03:19.310
UH,I WAS ATTACKED BY A MAN THAT YOU SAY WAS YOUR FATHER.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.760
AND NOW A STEWARDESS TURNS UP DEAD

03:22.280 --> 03:24.000
WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.770
AND YOU SAY, "DON'T OVERTHINK IT."

03:28.190 --> 03:29.120
I KNOW IT'S A LOT,

03:29.600 --> 03:33.530
AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THE BLAME. ALL RIGHT?

03:34.690 --> 03:37.180
I'M JUST SORRY THE CRAZY SEEMS TO BE RUBBING OFF ON YOU.

03:37.270 --> 03:40.380
YOU DON'T GET IT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.680
THIS IS ABOUT ME,MY LIFE.

03:44.130 --> 03:46.100
LOOK AT THAT GIRL'S FACE BACK THERE.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.330
LOOK AT ME.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.650
HOW CAN YOU JUST STAND THERE

03:51.710 --> 03:53.320
AND INSIST THAT THIS IS SOME PUPPET SHOW

03:53.340 --> 03:54.750
THAT'S BEING PERFORMED IN YOUR HEAD?

03:56.600 --> 03:57.190
ANNIE.

03:58.310 --> 03:59.040
I'M SORRY.

04:01.860 --> 04:04.300
VALERIE DIED OF BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.900
THERE WAS EVIDEN OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY

04:06.960 --> 04:09.000
IN THE 48 HOURS FORE SHE DIED,

04:09.050 --> 04:11.870
BUT NOTHG THAT WOULD INDICATE IT WAS ANYTHING BUT CONSENSUAL.

04:12.990 --> 04:13.610
ENTER!

04:15.160 --> 04:16.390
TYLER,GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.750
WE NEED YOUR EXPERTISE WITH THIS SURVEILLANCE STUFF

04:18.810 --> 04:20.399
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING ON ABOUT. OKAY.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.950
-DO YOU LIKE ANYONE FOR THE VALERIE PALMER MURDER? -NOT YET.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.950
WELL,ANNA-LISA FRANCO AND VALERIE PALMER

04:26.040 --> 04:29.400
-LIVED IN THE SAME BUILDING IN CHELSEA. -YEAH,A LOT OF STEWS LIVE THERE.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.430
IT'S LIKE THE PLAYBOY MANSION, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.030
I'M PICTURING PILLOW FIGHTS AND PILLBOX HATS.

04:35.090 --> 04:36.880
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO START.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.460
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING, BUT LAST TIME AROUND,

04:39.840 --> 04:41.470
OUR INVESTIGATION GOT STALLED.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.610
WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.920
-DIFFERENT? DIFFERENT HOW? -DIFFERENT...

04:48.710 --> 04:49.420
THAT.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.340
OH,YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.290
***********

05:05.360 --> 05:07.800
GOING UNDERCOVER AS A DEAD GIRL IS AN INSANE IDEA,

05:07.860 --> 05:09.910
-EVEN FOR HUNT. -IT WAS MY IDEA,SAM.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.670
-YOUR IDEA? -MM-HMM.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.000
-WHY?-WE KNOW THAT THE KILLER WORE A MASK.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.030
AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED, VALERIE NEVER SAW HIS FACE.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.240
SO I SHOULDN'T POSE ANY IMMEDIATE THREAT.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.470
YEAH,EXCEPT TT HE LEFT YOU FOR DEAD,

05:21.530 --> 05:24.620
-AND HE'S GONNA MAKE SURE HE GETS IT RIGHT THE SECOND TIME. -WE'LL BRING HIM DOWN BEFORE HE DOES.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.050
LOOK,SAM,I WENT THROUGH NAISA'S FILE.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.670
IT WAS NOTHING BUT DEAD ENDS.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.420
WE HAVE NO LEADS IN VALERIE'S CASE.

05:30.470 --> 05:33.210
WE CAN'T JUST STAND BY AND LET ANOTHER GIRL TURN UP DEAD.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.170
NO. NO,NO,NO. ANNIE,WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.870
THE UNIVERSE IS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

05:41.320 --> 05:42.330
I NEED ANSWERS.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.700
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET 'EM BY POSING

05:43.760 --> 05:47.490
-AS A DEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT? -NO,I'M GONNA GET THEM BY POSING AS A DEAD STEWARDESS.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.300
RIGHT,SAME THING. SOME DAY THAT WORD

05:49.350 --> 05:50.920
-WILL BECOME POLITICALLY INCORRECT. -WHY?

05:51.650 --> 05:53.930
I'M NOT SURE. I GUESS IT'S DEMEANING?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.540
REALLY? WILL THE SAME BE SAID FOR "SEAMSTRESS" AND "PRINCESS"

05:56.590 --> 05:58.090
IN THIS WONDERFUL FUTURE OF YOURS?

05:59.190 --> 06:01.360
OKAY,I-I THINK WE'RE GETTING OFF-TOPIC HERE.

06:01.450 --> 06:04.270
SAM,THERE IS NO NEXT OF KIN TO NOTIFY.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.550
THIS GIRL LED A VERY LONELY EXISTENCE.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.270
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN HER DIARY.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.000
SHE WAS A RECENT TRANSFER TO NEW YORK.

06:10.060 --> 06:12.050
-SHE WAS JUST GETTING TO KNOW HER CREWMATES. -THAT'S NO REASON.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.930
I CAN DO THIS,SAM, AND I WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH

06:15.000 --> 06:15.940
IF I HAD YOUR HELP.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:24.360 --> 06:25.810
YOU'LL WEAR THIS PIN AT ALL TIMES.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.370
THERE'S A MICROPHONE HIDDEN RIGHT HERE.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.170
SO I WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY GET TOO FRISKY-

06:29.250 --> 06:30.850
"A," 'CAUSE THEY'LL FIND THE DEVICE,

06:30.940 --> 06:33.010
AND "B," 'CAUSE WE'LL BE MONITORING YOU,

06:33.090 --> 06:34.290
AND THE LAST THING I NEED TO HEAR

06:34.360 --> 06:40.120
-IS THE SOUND OF YOUR WHOOPIE MOAN. -THIS IS THE PAN ATLANTIC AIR HOSTESS MANUAL.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.200
"A GIRDLE MUST BE WORN AT ALL TIMES... "

06:42.290 --> 06:45.550
"DUE TO THE PRESSURIZATION OF THE CABIN AT FLYING ALTITUDE,

06:45.620 --> 06:47.730
"THE ABDOMEN CAN BECOME DISNDED,

06:47.790 --> 06:49.930
CAUSING AN UNFLATTERING WAISTLINE."

06:50.650 --> 06:53.200
OKAY. I'M FROM ALBUQUERQUE,NEW MEXICO.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.230
MY PARENTS DIED WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.230
I WAS RAISED BY MY UNCLE FRANK.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.190
WHEN HE PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS YEAR,

06:59.250 --> 07:01.610
I DECIDED TO PURSUE MY DREAM OF SEEING THE WORLD

07:01.710 --> 07:03.300
AND BECOME AN AIRLINE STEWARDESS.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.560
OKAY. CAN YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.570
SURE. CAN I JUST SAY ONE MORE TIME

07:08.650 --> 07:10.520
WHAT AN AWFUL IDEA I THINK THIS IS?

07:10.570 --> 07:13.660
YOU CAN,AND I CAN REMIND YOU OF ALL THE RIDICULOUS SITUATIONS

07:13.750 --> 07:16.960
-YOU'VE PUT YOURSELF INTO. -OH,SO WHAT,YOU'RE TRYING TO OUT-IDIOT ME?

07:17.030 --> 07:20.990
NO,I'M TRYING TO DO MY JOB, CATCH A KILLER-JUST LIKE YOU.

07:22.830 --> 07:25.150
* I'VE JUST BEEN FAKIN' IT *

07:27.610 --> 07:30.630
* NOT REALLY MAKIN' IT *

07:41.210 --> 07:42.240
HELLO,MISS PALMER.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.140
WELCOME HOME.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.290
HI,WILSON.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.770
VALERIE LIVES IN A DOORMAN BUILDING IN CHELSEA

07:48.820 --> 07:50.510
WITH TWO OTHER STEWARDESSES.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.540
SHE'S NOT AT ALL THAT CLOSE TO HER ROOMMATES CAROL AND LESLIE.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.410
SEEMS LIKE VALERIE LIKES TO DO HER OWN THING.

08:07.010 --> 08:09.860
HEY,CHRIS. TAKE YOUR DATE OUT IN THIS LOVE MACHINE?

08:09.930 --> 08:12.490
IT'S MY USIN'S VAN. WHAT,IT'S COOL.

08:12.530 --> 08:13.150
ALL RIGHT,LET ME GUESS-

08:13.200 --> 08:17.090
-UPSTAIRS,OUTSIDE,AND YOU GOT SLAPPED. -GIVE HIM SOME CREDIT,RAY.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.520
UPSTAIRS,INSIDE?

08:19.570 --> 08:21.790
WELL,I-I DID WHAT YOU SAID,RAY.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.890
SHE HAD SOME COCKTAILS,AND... MM.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.450
AND WHAT? WELL,I HAD TO HAVE A FEW COCKTAILS.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.520
I MEAN,OTHERWISE IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.

08:29.570 --> 08:32.250
-GOOD. -I GOT MY HAND ON HER BLOUSE...

08:32.289 --> 08:33.980
-MM-HMM. -OUTSIDE,UPSTAIRS.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.630
-GOOD BOY. -AND,UH,I GO IN FOR THE KISS,

08:37.110 --> 08:40.650
AND... IT ALL CAME OUT.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.380
WHATDID?

08:43.220 --> 08:44.300
YOU GOT SICK ON HER?

08:45.230 --> 08:47.220
-ALL OVER HER FACE... -OHH.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.310
AND IN HER MOUTH.

08:49.470 --> 08:51.090
-THAT'S NOT FUNNY. -THAT'S DISGUSTING.

08:51.180 --> 08:55.080
<i>-SOMEONE'S AT THE FRONT DOOR. -WAIT. GUYS,GUYS. ANNIE'S LIVE.</i>

08:57.320 --> 08:57.820
OH!

08:58.820 --> 08:59.310
HI.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.280
VALERIE?

09:04.070 --> 09:04.580
HI.

09:11.630 --> 09:12.740
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

09:14.650 --> 09:15.910
OH,MY GOD. I'M GONNA THROW UP.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.960
HEY,SOUNDS LIKE YOUR KIND OF TWIRL,CHRIS.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.620
-YOU GUYS COULD SWAP VOMIT. -SHUT UP.

09:21.780 --> 09:25.100
-YOU CLEANED THE APARTMENT? -IT WAS KIND OF MESSY.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.950
IT'S ALWAYS MESSY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF YOU

09:33.590 --> 09:34.940
UH,IT LOOKS GREAT.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.180
I NEVER KNEW THAT WAS A COUCH.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.370
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A SPAWNING GROUND

09:38.430 --> 09:39.390
FOR DIRTY SWEATERS.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.800
NO-NUTS HAD TO TIDY UP? SHE ALMOST BLEW HER COVER.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.300
IT'S OKAY. TIDYING UP IS THE PERFECT WAY TO COVER

09:46.370 --> 09:48.570
THAT SHE SPENT THE LAST HOUR TURNING OVER THE APARTMENT.

09:50.550 --> 09:53.170
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THE LAST TWO DAYS? YOU JUST DISAPPEARED.

09:53.230 --> 09:54.320
I WAS MUGGED.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.510
-I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. -REALLY?

09:57.570 --> 09:59.220
YEAH. YOU'RE OKAY?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.340
YEAH,I WAS HIT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD,

10:01.390 --> 10:05.970
-AND THEY HELD ME A COUPLE DAYS FOR OBSERVATION. -WHAT DID THEY TAKE?

10:06.020 --> 10:06.930
YOU KNOW,NOT MUCH.

10:06.990 --> 10:11.960
-JUST A LITTLE CASH,MY TRANSISTOR RADIO. -OHH. YOU LOVED THAT RADIO.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.010
<i>I KNOW.</i>

10:21.480 --> 10:22.610
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.100
YOU KNOW-I KNOW. I SHOULD'VE.

10:25.130 --> 10:26.550
I WAS JUST A LITTLE OUT OF IT.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.730
I SHOULD GO CHECK ON LESLIE.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.440
THAT NEW NAVIGATOR CHALLENGED HER

10:34.510 --> 10:36.950
TO A HARVEY WALLBANGER CHUGGING CONTEST.

10:37.360 --> 10:37.850
OH.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.840
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY, VALERIE.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.250
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE IN.

10:52.870 --> 10:54.480
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HERE

10:54.560 --> 10:56.820
EXCEPT A LOT OF PICTURES OF DAVID CASSIDY.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.730
THERE'S A LOOSE CEILING PANEL.

11:14.830 --> 11:16.130
OH,MY GOD.

11:18.430 --> 11:19.080
OH,MY GOD.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.810
<i>THERE MUST BE CLOSE TO $2,000 HERE.</i>

11:22.880 --> 11:24.950
WHAT'S A STEW DOING WITH THAT KIND OF CRINKLE?

11:25.010 --> 11:27.720
<i>-I'M GUESSING NOTHING GOOD. -IT'S A DATE BOOK.</i>

11:28.230 --> 11:30.480
THERE'S A HIGHLIGHTED ENTRY FOR TOMORROW.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.530
"FLIGHT 413,SEAT 2-B.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.240
$500."

11:35.320 --> 11:37.110
GET HOLD OF A PASSENGER MANIFEST.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.340
SHE'S DOING GOOD IN THERE.

11:39.410 --> 11:42.520
YEAH,SHE IS. I'M GONNA GO OUT FOR SOME AIR.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.080
CONFIRM THAT WITH THE AIRLINE.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.290
Hey,Annie.

11:50.790 --> 11:51.960
Hey,Annie,it's Sam.

11:57.740 --> 11:58.290
SAM?

11:59.020 --> 11:59.720
Is that you?

11:59.810 --> 12:01.040
-EAH. -YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

12:01.490 --> 12:02.300
Thanks.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.320
VALERIE REALLY HAD A THING FOR DAVID CASSIDY.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.600
-"I THINK I LOVE YOU." -EXCUSE ME?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.860
THE-THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY'S BIGGEST HIT.

12:15.350 --> 12:16.790
OH! RIGHT.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.570
SO WHAT'S HUNT THINKING ABOUT FLIGHT 413?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.750
WELL,WE'RE- WE'RE CONTACTING THE AIRLINE.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.250
WE'LL KNOW MORE IN THE MORNING.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.110
Sam, can I tell you something?

12:30.590 --> 12:31.100
SURE.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.160
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A PLANE BEFORE.

12:37.010 --> 12:38.030
SERIOUSLY?

12:40.140 --> 12:41.020
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

12:41.060 --> 12:43.240
I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BEFORE.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.870
WOW. UM,WELL,

12:47.310 --> 12:49.510
SOMETIMES IT'S NICE

12:49.560 --> 12:52.300
TO PRETEND TO BE SOMEONE ELSE, YOU KNOW?

12:52.350 --> 12:53.480
SOMEWHERE ELSE...

12:54.320 --> 12:55.790
FAR,FAR AWAY FROM HOME.

12:58.140 --> 12:59.220
YOU KNOW,WHEN I WAS A KID,

12:59.290 --> 13:03.170
UM,I HAD THIS,UH...

13:03.240 --> 13:04.970
<i>OLD WASHING MACHINE BOX,</i>

13:05.050 --> 13:07.180
<i>AND I USED TO PRETEND IT WAS A SPACESHIP.</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:10.250
AND THERE WAS,UM, THIS MAGAZINE

13:10.780 --> 13:12.420
I USED TO TAKE WITH ME ON BOARD.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.110
ON THE COVER WAS A PICTURE OF A BOY

13:16.430 --> 13:19.200
WITH A SMILING STEWARDESS TAKING CARE OF HIM.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.680
SHE BECAME MY... MY PROTECTOR...

13:26.740 --> 13:27.960
MY SENTINEL.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.290
So are you tellinge

13:32.360 --> 13:35.410
GOING UNDERCOVER IS LIKE PLAYING MAKE-BELIEVE?

13:37.320 --> 13:39.190
YEAH,MAYBE A LITTLE.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.460
GOOD NIGHT,SAM.

13:47.590 --> 13:48.630
SWEET DREAMS,ANNIE.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.310
***********

14:05.380 --> 14:08.360
-SEAT 2-B WILL BE OCCUPIED BY LINCOLN HART.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.980
HE'S A REGULAR FLYER ON PAN ATLANTIC.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.520
HART WAS ON ANNA-LISA FRANCO'S LAST FLIGHT,TOO.

14:14.930 --> 14:17.650
HE'S ALSO BEEN COLLARED FOR POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SELL,

14:17.730 --> 14:19.680
BUT HIS LAWYERS GOT THE EVIDENCE SUPPRESSED,

14:20.070 --> 14:21.110
CHARGES WERE DROPPED,

14:21.170 --> 14:25.120
-AND THIS CLOWN IS STILL FLYIN' FIRST-CLASS. -WHATEVER HE'S GOT PLANNED FOR TODAY'S FLIGHT,

14:25.180 --> 14:28.950
<i>-I WANT TO MAKE SURE ANNIE'S COVERED. -SO WHAT'S OUR PLAN,BOSS?</i>

14:29.010 --> 14:30.000
OH,IT'S A BEAUT.

15:08.590 --> 15:09.580
HEY,CAROL.

15:10.030 --> 15:13.270
-DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH YOUR HAIR? -JUST A NEW HEADBAND.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.390
I LOVE IT MADLY. HEY.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.240
VALERIE?

15:22.910 --> 15:23.970
I HEARD YOU WERE ATTACKED.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.540
I WAS. I'M OKAY.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.530
YOU KNOW,I'M MORE CONCERNED WHAT YOU DID TO HIM.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.810
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF WHEN YOU'RE CORNERED.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.280
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK IN MY BIRD,PUSSYCAT.

15:36.470 --> 15:40.260
-UGH. HE'S SO FINE.- UGH. HE'S LIKE A SCULPTURE OF TOM JONES

15:40.330 --> 15:41.680
MA OUT OF CREAM CHEESE.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.130
<i>OH,BUT HE'S CUTE.</i>

15:45.490 --> 15:46.490
<i>WHO'S THAT?</i>

15:50.460 --> 15:51.260
YOU KNOW HIM?

15:51.730 --> 15:54.660
<i>-WE'VE MET A FEW TIMES. -OH,YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE ME.</i>

15:55.070 --> 15:57.170
HE CAN PUT MY TRAY IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.440
WE SHOULD GET STARTED ON PREFLIGHT.

16:06.490 --> 16:09.680
-WHISKEY? -UH,NO,THANKS. I'M,UH,FLYING IN AN HOUR.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.060
I KNOW. YOU'RE DEADHEADING ON MY BIRD.

16:13.980 --> 16:14.830
RONALD HARRIS.

16:15.890 --> 16:17.580
TOM... CRUISE.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.670
-TOM-TOM CRUISE. -WELL,TOM,YOU'RE OFF DUTY.

16:20.090 --> 16:22.400
YOU'RE NOT FLYING,SO RELAX, ENJOY THE RIDE.

16:22.970 --> 16:24.290
I'LL MAKE SURE THE GIRLS TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

16:26.170 --> 16:26.700
CHEERS.

16:26.770 --> 16:27.400
CHEERS.

16:30.100 --> 16:30.780
HEY,BABY.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.430
HI.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.990
PILOTS AND THEIR RITUALS.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.880
I'VE NEVER MET A MORE SUPERSTITIOUS BUNCH.

16:42.970 --> 16:46.420
RITA,THIS IS TOM CRUISE. TOM,RITA'S MY WIFE.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.400
I TOOK HER AWAY FROM STEWING,

16:48.450 --> 16:49.900
AND SHE'S MADE ME REGRET IT EVER SINCE.

16:51.070 --> 16:54.150
-YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. -THAT I AM,TOM.

16:54.610 --> 16:57.490
RITA AT HOME,SEXY STEWS AT WORK. YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.440
DON'T LOOK SO SURPRISED, TOM.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.560
YOU KNOW MOST BOYS BECOME PILOTS

17:05.619 --> 17:07.400
BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE IDEA OF FLIGHT-

17:07.869 --> 17:09.380
NOTHING BUT SKY AND SEA

17:09.430 --> 17:11.880
AND A LINE RUNNING ACROSS THE HORIZON.

17:12.970 --> 17:16.810
MY RONALD HERE LOVES THE IDEA OF STEWS-

17:16.900 --> 17:18.849
NOING BUT LIPS AND LASHES

17:18.950 --> 17:22.710
AND A LINE RUNNING ALL THE WAY UP THE BACK OF A STOCKING.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.599
MWAH! HAVE A GREAT FLIGHT, HONEYBUNCH.

17:27.190 --> 17:29.100
BRING ME BACK SOMETHING NICE FROM DENVER.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.670
LOOKS LIKE A FULL FLIGHT.

17:46.160 --> 17:46.620
EXCUSE ME,MA'AM.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.810
OH,SURE. THANKS.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.390
HI THERE.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.470
WOULD YOU LIKE A BLANKET?

17:57.450 --> 17:58.380
HEY THERE,MISSY.

18:00.310 --> 18:03.430
-I GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM HERE. -WHAT'S THAT?

18:03.640 --> 18:04.800
I GOT NO NUTS.

18:05.690 --> 18:08.070
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH MY NO-NUTS SITUATION?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.510
BECAUSE I REALLY HATE NO NUTS.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.800
OF COURSE,SIR.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.370
AND I LIKE 'EM WARM.

18:17.710 --> 18:18.590
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

18:19.050 --> 18:19.660
I'M OKAY.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.940
I JUST HOPE I DON'T GET AIRSICK. THAT COULD BE EMBARRASSING.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.110
YOU'LL BE FINE. JUST HOLD ON.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.730
UH-OH. BOGEY,1:00.

18:46.730 --> 18:47.920
WE'RE ABOUT TO PUSH FROM GATE.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.420
SEAT BELT.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.100
<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE EXPECTING SOME TURBULENCE</i>

19:08.150 --> 19:09.550
<i>DUE TO A PASSING STORM FRONT.</i>

19:09.630 --> 19:11.160
<i>SO WATCH YOURSELVES IN THE AISLE.</i>

19:11.230 --> 19:12.760
<i>BUT WE SHOULD BE THROUGIT MOMENTARILY.</i>

19:24.800 --> 19:25.640
DO YOU HAVE IT?

19:26.530 --> 19:29.110
UM... WELL-

19:29.160 --> 19:30.310
DO YOU HAVE IT?

19:32.560 --> 19:33.350
YES.

19:33.810 --> 19:34.930
THAT'S MY GIRL.

19:35.490 --> 19:36.920
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT IT.

19:37.450 --> 19:39.220
<i>ALL CREW MEMBERS, PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.</i>

19:40.510 --> 19:41.290
EXCUSE ME.

20:21.890 --> 20:23.490
HEY! KNOCK IT OFF!

20:23.880 --> 20:28.530
HEY! AAH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? KNOCK IT OFF!

20:28.590 --> 20:30.450
-STOP PLAYING GAMES WITH ME! -WHAT? AAH!

20:32.100 --> 20:34.190
SEEIN' HER ALIVE SPOOK YOU ROTTEN,MONKEY FACE?

20:34.260 --> 20:36.560
-NO! SHE WAS TOYING WITH ME! -SHUT UP!

20:36.600 --> 20:38.700
EVERYBODY,RELAX. I'M NYPD.

20:38.750 --> 20:42.110
-WHAT'S GOING ON? -TURN THIS BIRD AROUND. WE'RE HEADING BACK TO NEW YORK.

20:47.190 --> 20:49.870
*******

20:50.260 --> 20:52.690
YOU PAID OFF OTHER STEWARDESSES, TOO,DIDN'T YOU?

20:52.770 --> 20:56.470
IT'S A PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT WHICH THOSE WOMEN ARE VERY HAPPY WITH.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.570
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL. I WANT MY LAWYER.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.340
WHAT ABOUT ANNA-LISA FRANCO?

21:03.020 --> 21:04.330
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

21:04.410 --> 21:06.840
YOU ATTACKED VALERIE FOR NOT GIVING YOU YOUR STASH,

21:06.890 --> 21:08.750
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH ANNA-LISA,ISN'T IT?

21:09.930 --> 21:12.990
SHE MESSED UP ON YOUR DRUG LIVERY,SO YOU KILLED HER.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.420
WHOA. DRUGS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:15.910 --> 21:19.490
WE SEARCHED MR. HART'S APARTMENT AND FOUND THESE.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.890
I DON'T BUY DRUGS.

21:31.730 --> 21:34.160
I PAY STEWARDESSES BECAUSE I WANT THEIR UNDERWEAR.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.930
KEPT 'EM IN HIS PERSONAL SAFE KE THEY WERE BANK BONDS.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.560
THEY'RE EVEN MORE VALUABLE.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.540
ANYTHING THAT RESIDES BENEATH THOSE YUMMY STEW UNIFORMS,

21:41.600 --> 21:47.010
-I WANT THEM,AND I PAY TOP DOLLAR. -YEAH. HE EVEN KEPT A LOG OF HIS TRANSACTIONS.

21:47.490 --> 21:48.810
HE'S A NOOKIE BOOKIE.

21:50.820 --> 21:52.530
HE BREAKS THESE THIN OUT,

21:52.580 --> 21:54.460
AND THEN HE TAKES HERMAN TO THE CIRCUS.

21:54.550 --> 21:55.240
HE WHAT?

21:55.330 --> 21:58.830
YOU KNOW... TORTURE THE TENTACLE? CHOKE KOJAK? OH.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.910
PLAY TUG-OF-WAR WITH THE CYCLOPS? GOT IT.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.320
YOUR LAST TRANSACTION WITH VALERIE PALMER-

22:03.790 --> 22:05.300
YOU FOLLOWEDER HOME, DIDN'T YOU?

22:05.780 --> 22:08.490
ROUGHED HER UP, GRABBED HER KNICKERS?

22:08.550 --> 22:10.220
NO. ASK HER YOURSELF.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.610
AFTER I GOT MY MERCHANDISE, I WENT TO WORK.

22:12.670 --> 22:15.940
SHE WAS WITH THAT MUSTACHIOED PILOT WHO'S ALWAYS ALL OVER HER.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.510
PROBABLY THAT PILOT RONALD HARRIS.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.770
THAT'D MAKE HIM THE LAST PERSON TO SEE VALERIE ALIVE.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.320
ALIVE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:25.290 --> 22:27.450
LET'S CHECK OUT MR. HART'S,UH,ALIBI.

22:28.710 --> 22:31.610
YOU TOUCH THOSE, I'LL BREAK BOTH YOUR HANDS,

22:31.680 --> 22:35.550
WHICH COULD PUT A DAMPER ON YOUR... PADDLING THE CANOE.

22:42.150 --> 22:42.850
A MARTINI?

22:42.880 --> 22:44.550
I'D LOVE THAT, REALLY.

22:49.190 --> 22:49.620
HEY.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.110
HEY.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.710
SHH,SHH,SHH.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.920
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO CATCH UP ON THE FLIGHT.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.060
I WASN'T SURE IF YOU'D TALK TO ME AGAIN.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.920
THINGS GOT A LITTLE ROUGH LAST TIME.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.870
<i>WELL,I'M A BIG GIRL.</i>

23:00.380 --> 23:01.540
I CAN HANDLE IT.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.160
I'VE MISSED YOU AT OUR PARTIES.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.390
MAYBE I'LL HAVE TO START COMING AGAIN.

23:06.990 --> 23:09.800
I DON'T KNOW. LAST TIME YOU WERE NO FUN.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.530
ARE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'VE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART?

23:18.360 --> 23:19.810
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.180
YOU'RE NOT LIKE MOST MUSTACHED MEN I KNOW...

23:26.440 --> 23:29.180
ALWAYS COMPENSATING FOR SOMETHING.

23:29.650 --> 23:30.660
YEAH,RIGHT.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.500
<i>I'VE BEEN HAVING</i>

23:33.570 --> 23:34.830
THIS LITTLE FANTASY.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.820
I'M BRINGING YOU DESSERT IN THE COCKPIT.

23:39.700 --> 23:42.310
YOU TELL THE NAVIGATOR AND THE COPILOT TO LEAVE,

23:42.380 --> 23:44.570
AND THEY DO, SO IT'S JUST YOU AND ME

23:44.650 --> 23:45.980
AND THE DEEP BLUE SKY.

23:47.230 --> 23:50.480
YOU TELL ME TO TAKE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES,AND I DO,

23:50.540 --> 23:51.760
LIKE A GOOD GIRL.

23:52.610 --> 23:55.970
<i>I SERVE YOU YOUR HOT FUDGE SUNDAE COMPLETELY NAKED,</i>

23:56.040 --> 23:57.930
AND THEN I SPOON THE WHIPPED CREAM

23:58.000 --> 24:00.300
ALL OVER MY WARM,SOFT BODY.

24:00.330 --> 24:01.790
WE'RE HAVING ONE TOMORROW NIGHT.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.870
8:00 SHARP. BE THERE.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.210
REMEMBER THE RULES,THOUGH. BRING A DATE...

24:09.100 --> 24:10.420
<i>BUT NOT SOMEONE TOO GOOD-LOOKIN'.</i>

24:10.930 --> 24:12.220
YOU KNOW HOW JEALOUS I GET.

24:18.110 --> 24:18.940
I THINK HE BOUGHT IT.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.390
THAT WAS GOOD. NO-NUTS DID GOOD.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.700
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

24:24.160 --> 24:25.580
GO OUT FOR ICE CREAM.

24:30.710 --> 24:32.900
"I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD END UP LIKE THIS.

24:33.330 --> 24:36.580
"I DIDN'T. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GO HOME,

24:37.090 --> 24:38.270
"BACK TO ALBUQUERQUE.

24:38.820 --> 24:41.260
"NO,THERE'S NO ONE LEFT THERE THAT KNOWS MY NAME.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.920
"BUT NEW YORK CITY IS A BEAST.

24:44.840 --> 24:45.860
"IT HAS A ROAR.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.070
"YOU CAN HEAR IT WHEN YOU OPEN A WINDOW.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.510
"IT'S A MONSTER, AND IT SUSTAINS ITSELF

24:51.580 --> 24:53.800
"ON A STEADY DIET OF GIRLS LIKE ME.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.990
YOU CAN FEEL THAT IN ITS ROAR."

25:24.590 --> 25:26.940
SAM, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

25:27.430 --> 25:29.150
SURE,CHRIS. WHAT GOES ON?

25:29.230 --> 25:32.180
WELL,YOU KNOW THAT, UM,TWIRL THAT I WAS DATING?

BUT,UH,SHE AGREED TO GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.260
-GOOD. -AND I WAS,,I WAS WONDERING

25:44.330 --> 25:45.930
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME POINTERS,

25:46.420 --> 25:48.750
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE WOMEN LIKE YOU,

25:48.830 --> 25:51.400
AND... GOOD-LOOKIN' AND...

25:52.810 --> 25:53.220
OKAY.

25:55.150 --> 25:58.170
UM,WELL,LOOK,FORGET WHAT THESE APES TOLD YOU.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.730
JUST BE YOURSELF AND RELAX.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.240
YOUR DATE'S A HUMAN BEING. SHE-SHE'S NOT A "TWIRL."

26:02.300 --> 26:04.020
-MM. -SHE'LL BE NERVOUS.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.980
SHE'LL WANT TO BE LIKED, JUST LIKE YOU.

26:07.050 --> 26:10.510
JUST BE KIND AND SHOW HER SOME RESPECT,THAT'S ALL.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.350
ALL RIGHT,WE GOT THE SCOOP FROM ONE OF RONALD'S NEIGHBORS.

26:15.150 --> 26:17.190
HE THROWS THESE COUPLEONLY PARTIES

26:17.270 --> 26:19.050
WHERE PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE TILL THE NEXT DAY.

26:19.530 --> 26:21.290
HE RECOGNIZED ANNA-LISA'S PHOTOGRAPH,

26:21.380 --> 26:24.230
-SAID SHE WAS A FREQUENT GUEST. -THEY'RE SWINGERS.

26:24.300 --> 26:27.340
-WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON THERE. -BOSS,IT'S WHEN COUPLES

26:27.410 --> 26:29.510
HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER'S PARTNERS.

26:30.030 --> 26:31.450
THANK YOU, MASTERS AND JOHNSON.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.350
I MEANT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING GOING ON

26:33.420 --> 26:35.600
-THAT GOT TWO GIRLS KILLED. -OH.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.110
SEND NORRIS IN.

26:39.190 --> 26:42.130
-OH,COME ON. I-I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. -YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.870
IT'S A GREAT IDEA- INSPIRED,EVEN.

26:46.130 --> 26:47.360
SHE'S GONNA NEED A DATE.

26:53.870 --> 26:57.560
GREAT. A SEX PARTY, AND WE'RE SENDING IN PAT BOONE.

26:58.870 --> 27:01.080
GET DRESSED AND GET NORRIS.

27:06.170 --> 27:07.950
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THIS WAS WHO SHE REALLY WAS.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.870
YOU KNOW,I THINK SHE WAS JUST THIS SAD,LONELY GIRL

27:09.920 --> 27:13.150
WHO-WHO LOVED DAVID CASSIDY AND WANTED TO GO BACK

27:13.190 --> 27:15.720
TO ALBUQUERQUE,BUT SHE-SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY THERE,

27:15.770 --> 27:17.750
SO S LET HERSELF BE ADOPTED BY THESE PEOPLE.

27:18.210 --> 27:21.940
WITH THEIR SEX PARTIES AND THEIR TERRIBLE TURTLENECKS. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS,ANNIE.

27:22.010 --> 27:26.640
WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DIRECTION OUR LIVES TAKE. SAYS THE MAN WHO CLAIMS TO BE FROM THE FUTURE.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.020
SO IF SOMEONE GETS FRESH WITH YOU,I WANT YOU TO GO

27:28.050 --> 27:30.070
FOR THE TRACHEA OR THE EYES OR THE GROIN.

27:30.130 --> 27:34.380
WE DON'T WANT A REPEAT OF LINCOLN HART. YOU KNOW,I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR BACKSTORY-

27:34.420 --> 27:36.470
-YOU KNOW,HOW WE MET. -YEP.

27:36.540 --> 27:39.310
YOUR NAME IS,UH,TOM, BUT I CALL YOU TOMMY.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.890
AND WE MET AT THIS NIGHTCLUB IN PRAGUE WHERE A LOT OF STEWS

27:42.950 --> 27:45.100

27:48.430 --> 27:50.970
AND YOU WERE REALLY PATHETIC, AND I TOOK PITY ON YOU.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.990
UH,IMPROBABLE,'CAUSE I HAVE EXCELLENT DANCE MOVES.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.540
NO. I SAW A PASSENGER GET FRESH WITH YOU,

27:56.630 --> 27:58.780
AND I BEAT HIM TO DEATH WITH HIS MEAL TRAY.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.640
OKAY? AND TELL EVERYBODY AT THE PARTY THAT,

28:01.720 --> 28:04.000
'CAUSE,YOU KNOW, THEY'LL STAY AWAY.

28:04.070 --> 28:07.110
-DON'T YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BLOW OUR COVER? -I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT OUR COVER.

28:07.170 --> 28:08.600
YOU GET HURT, I'LL LEVEL THE PLACE!

28:14.650 --> 28:15.200
AHEM.

28:17.270 --> 28:20.700
OR,YOU KNOW,WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE NIGHTCLUB IN PRAGUE?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.100
I GIVE THIS OPERATION TEN MINUTES

28:23.150 --> 28:25.090
BEFORE NO-NUTS BLOWS HER COVER.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.260
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? HEY,CHRIS.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.110
IT'S A SEX PARTY,WITH SEX. TALKIN' THE TALK IS ONE THING,

28:30.170 --> 28:34.100
BUT NORRIS IS FRIGID LIKE AN ICE CUBE IN AN ESKIMO'S... HOLY COW.

EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP FOR GRABS.

35:21.730 --> 35:22.930
YEAH. AND WHAT ABOUT VALERIE?

36:07.720 --> 36:09.600
<i>BEARS MADE HIBERNATION FAMOUS,</i>

<i>-BUT BATS HIBERNATE,TOO! SPINY ANTEATERS... -THE DUMP SITE!</i>

36:15.400 --> 36:18.700
POOR-WILLS,A SMALL BIRD OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES-

36:18.760 --> 36:20.960
THEY HAVE A NOTE OF TWO SYLLABLES ONLY.

36:21.030 --> 36:23.210
THEY ALSO HIBERNATE!

36:23.280 --> 36:25.120

36:27.390 --> 36:28.410
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:30.880 --> 36:35.360
<i>-I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME THERE. -PLEASE. RONALD WANTED YOU THERE.</i>

36:35.440 --> 36:37.450
JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE MY HUSBAND HAPPY

36:37.520 --> 36:39.170
DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA LET SOME LITTLE TART LIKE YOU

36:39.230 --> 36:41.890
TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME. SEX IS ONE THING.

36:42.390 --> 36:46.900
BUT FALLING IN LOVE... THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.150
I SAW THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ANNA-LISA...

36:49.570 --> 36:51.090
<i>THEN YOU.</i>

36:51.510 --> 36:53.010
I DON'T WANT YOUR HUSBAND.

36:55.210 --> 36:56.500
HE USED TO LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

37:02.550 --> 37:04.410
I THOUGHT I GOT RID OF YOU ONCE BEFORE.

37:07.090 --> 37:07.620
WELL...

37:09.060 --> 37:10.730
I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

37:19.130 --> 37:21.700
-HEY,BUDDY,YOU SEE ANYONE COME THROUGH HERE? -NO.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.700

37:33.860 --> 37:35.530

37:37.610 --> 37:38.430
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

37:38.880 --> 37:40.140

37:41.660 --> 37:42.580
GO,NUTS!

37:53.870 --> 37:54.900
CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DID IT.

37:56.860 --> 37:57.740
LOVELY RITA...

37:58.540 --> 37:59.270
A KILLER.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.020
SHE S JEALOUS.

38:05.420 --> 38:06.030
WOMEN.

38:07.860 --> 38:08.870
I'LL NEVER FIGURE THEM OUT.

38:10.530 --> 38:11.810
THEY'RE NOT SO COMPLICATED.

38:12.310 --> 38:15.380
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T TOY WITH THEIR AFFECTIONS.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.060
YOU'RE NOT OF THE TIMES,CHAMP.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.650
I SEE SOMETHING I WANT, I GO FOR IT.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.680
I SAW THE WAY YOU WERE LOOKING AT VALERIE

38:26.710 --> 38:27.970
OR WHATEVER HER NAME IS.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.350
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ABOUT IT?

38:31.620 --> 38:33.070
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT BETWEEN US.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.420
BALONEY. I MAY NOT KNOW WOMEN, SLICK,BUT I KNOW MEN.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.150
I KNOW WHAT A MAN WHO DIGS A WOMAN LOOKS LIKE.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.770
AND YOU,SLICK,

38:41.770 --> 38:43.240
YOU'RE A MAN WHO DIGS A WOMAN.

38:43.670 --> 38:46.760
(The Partridge Family's "Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque" playing)

38:47.240 --> 38:50.330
VALERIE WASN'T A BAD PERSON. SHE JUST GOT CAUGHT UP

38:50.390 --> 38:51.960
IN ALL THE WRONG THINGS ALONG THE WAY,

38:52.020 --> 38:54.110
AND BEFORE SHE REALIZED IT, IT WAS TOO LATE.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.830
AND WHAT ABOUT THESE UNEXPLAINED THINGS

38:57.920 --> 39:00.840
HAPPENING TO YOU? DID YOU GET ANY CLOSER TO FIGURING THEM OUT?

39:02.610 --> 39:03.120
I DID.

39:05.390 --> 39:08.000
I WONDERED WHY THE UNIVERSE PUT ME IN VALERIE'S SHOES.

39:08.850 --> 39:10.100
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OFOW ALIKE WE ARE,

39:11.020 --> 39:12.730
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN PHYSICALLY.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.390
YOU KNOW,I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. WHY?

39:17.240 --> 39:19.850
VALERIE HAD DREAM WHEN SHE BECAME A STEWARDESS,

39:20.310 --> 39:21.570
BEFORE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.

39:22.420 --> 39:25.050
I HAD A DREAM,TOO, WHEN I JOINED THE POLICE FORCE.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.730
THEN AFTER BEING "NO-NUTS WITH THE DOUGHNUTS"

39:27.790 --> 39:30.480
FOR SO LONG, I'VE LOST SIGHT OF THAT.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.010
WELL, I GUESS THE QUESTION IS...

39:38.080 --> 39:39.410
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABT IT?

39:55.080 --> 39:55.790
ENTER!

39:58.610 --> 40:01.340
SIR,I'M A GOOD COP.

40:01.680 --> 40:02.360
NO,.

40:03.450 --> 40:04.810
I'M A GREAT COP.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.280
I'VE MADE BREAKS IN HALF A DOZEN CASES THIS YEAR.

40:09.730 --> 40:11.100
I WANT TO BE A DETECTIVE.

40:11.860 --> 40:14.390
I'M READY, AND I THINK I DESERVE IT.

40:15.820 --> 40:17.890
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M HERE.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.320
BUT HERE...

40:21.280 --> 40:22.520
CAN'T BE ALL I HAVE.

40:53.940 --> 40:55.930
I JUST,UH, I- I WANTED TO SATHANK YOU.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.410
WHAT FOR?

40:57.860 --> 41:02.130
-WELL,I-I HAD A DATE WITH MY GIRL. -MM. HOW'D IT GO?

41:02.190 --> 41:05.530
IT WAS,UM... REALLY NICE.

41:07.550 --> 41:08.340
GOOD.

41:09.890 --> 41:10.880
NICE IS GOOD.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.110
GOOD NIGHT.

41:46.970 --> 41:47.740
ANNIE?

42:02.590 --> 42:11.720
