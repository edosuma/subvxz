WEBVTT

00:00.979 --> 00:03.896
(cicadas chirping)

00:19.313 --> 00:22.480
(indistinct rumbling)

00:30.071 --> 00:33.821
(dramatic suspenseful music)

01:12.913 --> 01:15.580
(alarm beeping)

01:19.460 --> 01:21.193
- Now why was that so painful?

01:22.450 --> 01:26.730
Why was that 60 seconds,
the most uncomfortable

01:26.730 --> 01:27.723
part of your day?

01:28.770 --> 01:32.270
See, I think it's because society tells us

01:32.270 --> 01:36.710
to avoid silence, and
we're conditioned to think

01:36.710 --> 01:38.410
that something's wrong with quiet.

01:39.668 --> 01:40.510
(laughs)

01:40.510 --> 01:43.540
I can't tale it anymore,
what's in the bag?

01:43.540 --> 01:44.373
- You really wanna know?

01:44.373 --> 01:45.790
- [Clayton] Yes.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.860
- Okay I know it's a little late,

01:47.860 --> 01:50.030
but happy graduation babe.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.510
- [Clayton] Oh my Gosh,
that looks amazing.

01:52.510 --> 01:53.683
Did you make this?

01:55.060 --> 01:57.383
- I made the decision to buy it.

01:59.010 --> 02:01.870
- [Clayton] Okay, just
think about living here,

02:01.870 --> 02:03.760
would you get lonely?

02:03.760 --> 02:06.000
I mean there are times
where you'd wanna go here

02:06.000 --> 02:08.699
for a vacation or an escape.

02:08.699 --> 02:12.993
But the idea of living
here, routinely, day-to-day.

02:14.030 --> 02:16.831
If I'm being honest with myself, I don't--

02:16.831 --> 02:17.920
(banging on door)

02:17.920 --> 02:20.183
Ah that must be Hunter.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.420
Well, patience is his best quality,

02:26.420 --> 02:28.120
so obviously he's a piece of shit.

02:29.130 --> 02:30.490
- What the fuck!

02:31.850 --> 02:32.970
- [Clayton] Just gonna
let yourself in huh?

02:32.970 --> 02:35.640
- Yes, and you're welcome
for me being here.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.480
- [Clayton] What else would you be doing?

02:37.480 --> 02:38.900
- Getting laid.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.323
- But is too much silence a bad thing?

02:44.490 --> 02:47.860
Are the mundane relationships that we keep

02:47.860 --> 02:49.993
the only things weaving us to sanity?

02:52.870 --> 02:54.173
- Are you sure that this is okay?

02:54.173 --> 02:57.610
I mean, I know I said
we'd go out to celebrate.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.960
- [Clayton] What, are you
kidding, look at this.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.343
Okay, this is perfect.

03:04.860 --> 03:06.303
- Just us, that's okay?

03:11.110 --> 03:14.628
So are you able to meet
with my cousin next week?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.570
- [Clayton] Um, no.

03:16.570 --> 03:17.700
- Why not?

03:17.700 --> 03:19.780
There's a position open and
she wants to interview you.

03:19.780 --> 03:23.012
I mean we could maybe get you
out of your parents house.

03:23.012 --> 03:23.920
(laughs)

03:23.920 --> 03:26.433
- [Clayton] Um, I'm busy next week.

03:27.930 --> 03:30.663
- The whole week, you're just busy?

03:31.610 --> 03:32.460
- [Clayton] Yeah.

03:33.530 --> 03:36.260
- Okay mystery man,
what are you busy with?

03:36.260 --> 03:38.570
- [Clayton] Well it's a surprise.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.860
- Like a good surprise?

03:40.860 --> 03:43.220
- [Clayton] Well I think
it's a good surprise,

03:43.220 --> 03:45.963
for you it's like a surprise car crash.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.433
Hey.

03:51.252 --> 03:52.210
(groans)

03:52.210 --> 03:53.883
Yeah, she's a little mad at me.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.930
Hey dad.

03:56.930 --> 03:57.763
- Hi son.

03:57.763 --> 03:59.280
- [Clayton] Hey, can I interview you?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.911
- Sure what about?

04:00.911 --> 04:05.180
- [Clayton] Um, just like
your job and you know,

04:05.180 --> 04:06.163
your career.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.020
- Yeah, maybe later.

04:11.820 --> 04:14.550
- Some of the best art
in the world was created

04:14.550 --> 04:17.260
in the darkest hours
of those artists lives.

04:17.260 --> 04:20.360
And I'm talking about the
whole artistic spectrum okay,

04:20.360 --> 04:23.400
poets, musicians, film makers, painters,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.483
novelists, anyone who creates.

04:27.110 --> 04:30.060
The thing is those
artists happily shared it

04:30.060 --> 04:31.170
because they...

04:34.800 --> 04:36.950
I don't know, they had too.

04:36.950 --> 04:37.783
Makaila.

04:38.730 --> 04:40.110
Makaila, (groans).

04:40.110 --> 04:43.050
Curt Cobain, Van Gogh, Edgar Allen Poe,

04:43.050 --> 04:45.760
they've all found
masterpieces through insanity.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.890
- Well I mean I think
it's a waste of time,

04:48.890 --> 04:51.920
but then also I think
it's kinda fucking dumb.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.010
- [Clayton] Wow okay.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.250
- I mean clearly, you're going through

04:54.250 --> 04:55.920
a quarter life crisis, so--

04:55.920 --> 04:56.753
- No.
- That's fine.

04:56.753 --> 04:58.180
- [Clayton] Anyways,
back to the interview.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.810
- You've spent the last
three months growing

04:59.810 --> 05:00.840
a depression beard.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.090
- This isn't a depression beard.

05:02.090 --> 05:05.040
- That is a depression
beard and you know it.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.930
You are three days away from
a straight-up homeless beard.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.050
- Okay cool man, thanks
so much for coming out.

05:11.050 --> 05:12.890
- You know what, I'm being a good friend,

05:12.890 --> 05:15.260
and good friends tell the fucking truth.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.750
- Ernest Hemingway said the terrible mood

05:17.750 --> 05:19.650
of depression, whether
it's any good or not

05:19.650 --> 05:21.483
is known as the artists reward.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.641
I'll be honest with you, I haven't

05:25.641 --> 05:29.113
taken anything seriously
in a very long time.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.203
It's time I do.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.080
So the plan, to create loneliness.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.100
Mikaila's gonna drop me off
deep in the Georgia Mountains,

05:39.100 --> 05:42.640
no town whatsoever for 20 miles, no car,

05:42.640 --> 05:44.660
no phone, no GPS.

05:44.660 --> 05:48.480
Just me alone in the
woods with my thoughts

05:48.480 --> 05:50.430
for five days.

05:50.430 --> 05:52.360
- You know, look at me man, I did it.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.170
I did the sell out thing
that you're talking about.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.730
It got me two weeks
paid vacation, benefits,

05:56.730 --> 05:58.350
and I get to pretend that I'm good at golf

05:58.350 --> 05:59.183
every once in a while.

05:59.183 --> 06:00.640
It's not bad.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.850
- Wow.

06:01.850 --> 06:04.610
No I'm sorry, there's so
much to look forward too

06:04.610 --> 06:05.906
when you put it like that.

06:05.906 --> 06:06.739
- You know what I think
you're fucking problem is,

06:06.739 --> 06:08.270
is that I think you've
seen too many movies

06:08.270 --> 06:10.629
with manic pixie dream girls in 'em, okay.

06:10.629 --> 06:11.523
- What?
- You know

06:11.523 --> 06:12.370
what I'm talking about.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.010
It's just these girls who are just like,

06:14.010 --> 06:16.240
just find your passion, it's
exactly what you sound like.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.370
Okay just find you passion,
and then once you've found

06:18.370 --> 06:20.650
that passion just hug it, okay.

06:20.650 --> 06:25.520
And then that hug will bloom
into happiness and joy,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.140
and you'll just come back from the dead,

06:27.140 --> 06:29.073
and start just loving life.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.400
- Oh you're done, thank God, you're done.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.605
Okay.

06:34.605 --> 06:35.438
- Manic pixie dream girls aren't real.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.370
- Let's just, let's just do the thing

06:37.370 --> 06:39.940
that I invited you over
here to help me with okay.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.542
Can we just do that?

06:41.542 --> 06:42.923
Please?

06:44.370 --> 06:45.203
Where were we?

06:46.710 --> 06:47.543
- Where were we?

06:48.910 --> 06:51.663
We were at finding your
passion, and hugging it.

06:54.650 --> 06:55.930
- [Makaila] All right so Hunter.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.459
- Yes.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.165
- [Makaila] Tell me about
your best friend Clayton.

06:59.165 --> 07:00.960
(laughs)

07:00.960 --> 07:03.740
- Oh man, he is the clumsiest
person in the world.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.449
- I mean he's clumsy, but I wouldn't say

07:05.449 --> 07:07.250
he's the clumsiest person in the world.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.113
- No it's true, anyone
clumsier then Clayton is dead.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.890
Let's see, what else?

07:12.890 --> 07:14.687
This is gonna be so good.

07:14.687 --> 07:18.573
I mean he is really smart,
but you can't call him bright.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.130
One time he ate gas station sushi.

07:22.130 --> 07:23.930
- Okay.
- He likes baths better

07:23.930 --> 07:25.530
then showers.
- Okay, I mean things

07:25.530 --> 07:26.880
pertaining to this experiment,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.540
not weird shit you know about each other.

07:29.540 --> 07:33.320
- In high school he
would make study guides

07:33.320 --> 07:35.303
at finals time for all the students,

07:35.303 --> 07:38.630
but he would spend so much time making

07:38.630 --> 07:40.430
these study guides to sell them,

07:40.430 --> 07:43.360
that he wouldn't spend any
time actually studying.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.503
And then he would fail himself.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.140
But you know, I mean he'd
always come off with like

07:49.140 --> 07:51.840
1000 bucks or so for Christmas

07:51.840 --> 07:53.240
or summer break or whatever.

07:55.040 --> 07:59.175
That's just the first
thing that comes to me.

07:59.175 --> 08:01.258
- No that's, that's good.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.480
- Can I just say one more thing?

08:04.480 --> 08:05.890
- Oh my Gosh.

08:05.890 --> 08:07.880
- So what, God you just graduated,

08:07.880 --> 08:09.520
and you don't know what you're
gonna do with your life.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.270
Welcome to everybody's thought process

08:11.270 --> 08:12.648
that's ever graduated.

08:12.648 --> 08:14.680
You're just scared,
first time in your life,

08:14.680 --> 08:16.980
you don't have everything
planned out for you.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.210
Yes, thank you, it's
finally been said okay.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.810
I think you're fine,
and we can continue now,

08:24.810 --> 08:26.163
but I think you're fine.

08:27.410 --> 08:30.360
- Okay, thank you.
- All right, so what's

08:30.360 --> 08:31.710
the first fucking question?

08:32.730 --> 08:33.630
- Huh.

08:33.630 --> 08:34.620
Um...

08:38.590 --> 08:39.903
I don't know.

08:45.060 --> 08:46.830
There's like a whole foot--

08:46.830 --> 08:47.663
- I know.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.290
- Hunter are you on a wide enough lens

08:50.290 --> 08:51.470
to capture all of her hatred?

08:51.470 --> 08:52.310
- [Hunter] Got it.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.920
- Oh good, we can continue now.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.197
- [Hunter] All right,
good afternoon Mikaila,

08:58.197 --> 09:02.440
and Clayton, it's the eve
of your solo camping trip.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.590
And how are we feeling this afternoon--

09:03.590 --> 09:05.580
- Stop, take it back.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.460
- [Hunter] How are you feeling?

09:07.460 --> 09:10.100
- Excited, er, a little nervous.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.603
- [Hunter] And what about you Mikaila?

09:12.980 --> 09:17.980
- Annoyed, frustrated,
upset, angry, confused--

09:18.510 --> 09:20.370
- Just, just all of the negative words

09:20.370 --> 09:22.045
in the English language.

09:22.045 --> 09:24.860
(speaking in foreign language)

09:24.860 --> 09:26.510
That's French for something mean.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.190
Hunter, how, how did I describe how she

09:30.190 --> 09:32.399
is treating me the other day?

09:32.399 --> 09:33.885
Can you remember, it was a metaphor.

09:33.885 --> 09:36.445
- No I'd love to hear this metaphor.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.010
- [Hunter] No I wouldn't do it.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.602
- No please,
- Don't, don't.

09:39.602 --> 09:40.435
- I would love to hear it.

09:40.435 --> 09:41.780
- [Hunter] Don't.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.100
- You're treating me
like I am running over

09:44.100 --> 09:47.640
your dog while I'm stabbing
your family to death,

09:47.640 --> 09:50.373
while simultaneously
banging your best friend.

09:53.940 --> 09:54.773
So...

09:58.180 --> 09:59.830
- We can start the interview now.

10:00.970 --> 10:04.670
- [Hunter] Okay, um, why...

10:04.670 --> 10:09.110
Mikaila, why on your best, I
mean to your understanding,

10:09.110 --> 10:13.207
to your best understanding
is he doing this?

10:13.207 --> 10:14.040
- What?

10:14.040 --> 10:18.460
- [Hunter] Like why is his
inspiration to do this, or what?

10:18.460 --> 10:20.650
- Dude you're gonna have to
work on your interviewing voice,

10:20.650 --> 10:23.040
and your dyslexia, like I
straight up wrote the question,

10:23.040 --> 10:24.380
just read it off the card.

10:24.380 --> 10:25.986
- Stop he's helping you.

10:25.986 --> 10:27.002
- [Hunter] Thank you.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.270
- No, no, no, right now it
feels like I'm helping him

10:28.270 --> 10:29.960
by giving him a fucking reading lesson.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.580
- Clayton.
(Hunter laughs)

10:31.580 --> 10:32.980
- [Hunter] No that was good.

10:34.630 --> 10:35.960
- [Mikaila] You mentioned that story

10:35.960 --> 10:37.687
from high school earlier.

10:37.687 --> 10:40.580
- Yeah, yeah, in 10th grade.

10:40.580 --> 10:45.580
Our teacher, she made
us write these plays,

10:45.670 --> 10:47.230
you know these short plays.

10:47.230 --> 10:52.230
And Clayton decides to
write this crazy story

10:53.630 --> 10:57.050
about a mythical land
with this king and queen.

10:57.050 --> 11:00.750
And it's like a bunch of
bullshit, but the queen,

11:00.750 --> 11:04.030
gets kidnapped by the
enemy king of another land.

11:04.030 --> 11:08.803
So the queens name was Syphilis, okay.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.720
So I mean just imagine this,

11:11.720 --> 11:14.750
this class full of immature high schoolers

11:14.750 --> 11:16.930
just on the floor.

11:16.930 --> 11:20.460
The teacher gives him an F, she said,

11:20.460 --> 11:23.713
it was well written, but the
material was inappropriate.

11:24.910 --> 11:28.650
I don't know, I think,
that story really sums up

11:28.650 --> 11:30.390
both sides of Clayton.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.226
- Mikaila, I'm gonna be fine okay,

11:32.226 --> 11:34.560
I mean I'm pretty sure if Tom Hanks did it

11:34.560 --> 11:37.230
for five years, then I
can do it for five days.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.466
- Tom Hanks?

11:38.466 --> 11:41.570
- Yeah, he did it in Castaway.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.150
- That's a movie, Tom Hanks isn't real.

11:44.150 --> 11:46.030
- No Tom Hanks is definitely real.

11:46.030 --> 11:49.400
- Okay, it's not

11:49.400 --> 11:51.970
you just going out into
the woods that bothers me,

11:51.970 --> 11:53.790
what bothers me is the fact that you're

11:53.790 --> 11:57.770
disconnecting from literally everything.

11:57.770 --> 12:02.350
No car, no phone, I mean
what if you get hurt?

12:02.350 --> 12:05.480
What if you get attacked by
a bear or someone robs you--

12:05.480 --> 12:08.320
- No, no, no, none of that's gonna happen!

12:08.320 --> 12:11.900
I'm gonna feel alone, that's it.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.930
I'm gonna learn things
about myself in the process.

12:14.930 --> 12:17.623
I'm gonna come back with a great story.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.233
That...

12:23.430 --> 12:24.263
That's it.

12:27.270 --> 12:28.323
Mikaila, Mikaila.

12:34.365 --> 12:35.782
That was awkward.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.150
What are you gonna do side with her now?

12:42.110 --> 12:46.793
So this is it, last
thoughts before I head up.

12:51.362 --> 12:54.093
I'm a little nervous
but this is my chance.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.890
This is my chance to
harness some sort of storm,

13:00.890 --> 13:02.483
and once evolved, share it.

13:03.581 --> 13:06.498
(clippers buzzing)

13:13.440 --> 13:15.313
So wish me luck.

13:27.830 --> 13:30.640
And we're headed up to the mountains.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.470
Mikaila's syked, you can tell by the vein

13:32.470 --> 13:34.670
in her forehead how excited she is.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.538
- Clayton it's way too early.

13:36.538 --> 13:39.930
- I want, I want you to
look into this camera

13:39.930 --> 13:41.820
and say one positive thing.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.840
It can be anything.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.900
Hey it's pretty cool that
the sun rose this morning.

13:46.900 --> 13:50.300
It's awesome that we're
both currently not on fire,

13:50.300 --> 13:51.760
'cause that would suck.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.460
- You know I could just turn around.

13:53.460 --> 13:56.860
- No, no, that's, we're good.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.803
I just want it to be said
though, ahead of time,

13:58.803 --> 14:00.420
that I'm gonna come back with this

14:00.420 --> 14:02.520
dissertation on life.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.370
You know, this life dissertation.

14:04.370 --> 14:06.320
And you're gonna apologize.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.580
Prediction submitted, there it is.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.230
- Can we please just not
talk about the trip anymore.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.420
- I'm sure Christopher
Columbus' girlfriend

14:18.420 --> 14:21.390
wasn't happy whenever he
went on the boat to America.

14:21.390 --> 14:22.683
- Yeah that's the same.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.780
- She was literally like
"You're gonna fall off Earth."

14:27.780 --> 14:29.530
She probably wasn't as mean to him.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.830
You win, turn the car around,

14:32.830 --> 14:35.740
I'll find a different means
for creative inspiration

14:35.740 --> 14:39.590
involving black tar
heroine and alley syringes.

14:39.590 --> 14:40.673

15:15.346 --> 15:17.570
Look at him, not a care in the damn world.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.020
- Hey let's play a game
called what decade is it?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.973
Excuse me ma'am where's the
nearest roller blade store?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.020
The fact that you one day woke up

15:34.020 --> 15:37.170
without a sense of humor kinda bothers me.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.300
- Well you know, actually, I'm storing up

15:40.300 --> 15:42.650
every stupid thing you say in my head

15:42.650 --> 15:44.750

15:55.600 --> 15:57.602
(Clayton laughs)

15:57.602 --> 16:00.190
Can you just put that camera down?

16:00.190 --> 16:01.023
Let's just talk.

16:02.030 --> 16:02.880
- [Clayton] Yeah.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.860
But did you, did you ever play?

16:06.860 --> 16:09.560
- [Mikaila] Um, I played T Ball but I got

16:09.560 --> 16:10.740
kicked off the team.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.870
- [Clayton] You got kicked
off your T Ball team?

16:12.870 --> 16:14.306
- [Mikaila] Yes.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.400
- [Clayton] T Ball like when you're five?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.870
- [Mikaila] Yes, it's not funny.

16:17.870 --> 16:19.760
- Give me 1000 years of guesses,

16:19.760 --> 16:20.900
I'd have no idea.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.610
Like how does somebody
get kicked off their T--

16:22.610 --> 16:24.720
- Okay, all right, I'll explain.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.230
So every week the
teammates would take turns

16:27.230 --> 16:28.940
bringing snacks for after the game.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.570
- Uh huh.
- And when it was my week

16:30.570 --> 16:32.880
my mom made these boss
chocolate and peanut butter

16:32.880 --> 16:35.530
cupcakes, anyways there's this one girl

16:35.530 --> 16:38.740
who never threw me the ball,
was always kinda rude to me,

16:38.740 --> 16:41.405
and she refused to eat my moms cupcakes.

16:41.405 --> 16:42.238
(Clayton laughs)

16:42.238 --> 16:43.080
Which is unacceptable.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.740
So I got sick of it one day,

16:45.740 --> 16:47.660
and smashed a cupcake in her face.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.743
And er, then she went to the hospital.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.090
- [Clayton] What?

16:52.090 --> 16:56.183
- Turns out she was severely
allergic to peanuts.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.390
(Clayton laughs)

16:57.390 --> 17:00.160
So er, yeah that traumatizing event

17:00.160 --> 17:02.340
ended my baseball career.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.310
- [Clayton] Why did
you never tell me that?

17:04.310 --> 17:07.170
- Well I tend to skip
stories where I almost kill

17:07.170 --> 17:08.663
a five-year-old child.

17:08.663 --> 17:10.746
(laughs)

17:11.682 --> 17:13.203
So what is this place exactly?

17:14.470 --> 17:16.859
- Er, I don't know just some patch of land

17:16.859 --> 17:18.540
between two mountains.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.623
Nothing's there though, that's all I know.

19:10.170 --> 19:13.127

in the middle of nowhere.

19:13.127 --> 19:14.850
- Good.

19:14.850 --> 19:17.723
- I hope I remember how to get back here.

19:18.665 --> 19:19.760
- No that's not funny, okay.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.450
You use your phone and you drop a pin.

19:21.450 --> 19:23.600
- Baby you know I lose
things all the time.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.660
- Wow, no it didn't get
any funnier that time.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.324
- Well you know, what if I die,

19:28.324 --> 19:31.150
and no one's here to
come get you in six days.

19:31.150 --> 19:34.780
An 18-wheeler just runs
me off the road and bam,

19:34.780 --> 19:35.843
no more Mikaila.

19:37.074 --> 19:38.063
No one to come get you.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.300
- Well that was dark.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.631
- Yeah, and you know I
actually didn't even need

19:44.631 --> 19:45.610
a little camping trip for that one,

19:45.610 --> 19:46.933
it just sorta came to me.

19:48.830 --> 19:49.663
- Well played.

19:51.970 --> 19:55.493
Hey, I'm gonna meet with
your cousin when I get back.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.980
- Look I know you don't
wanna be a corporate blogger.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.003
- Yeah but I still wanna meet with her.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.713
- Well I mean there's no harm in trying.

20:08.047 --> 20:08.880
- Yeah, exactly.

20:10.550 --> 20:14.800
- Look I'm sorry, I've seemed like

20:14.800 --> 20:16.230
such a bitch lately.

20:16.230 --> 20:20.920
It's just, you know it's
because I love you right?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.303
- Of course, yeah.

20:46.090 --> 20:47.740
- Shit.
- What?

20:47.740 --> 20:51.073
- A tree is down, I guess this'll do.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.024
Here.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.050
I'll lead you in.

21:12.110 --> 21:12.953
- [Clayton] Mikaila?

21:16.430 --> 21:18.053
- [Mikaila] Okay, turn this way.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.274
- [Clayton] You're not
gonna kill me are ya?

21:22.274 --> 21:23.107
(Mikaila chuckles)

21:23.107 --> 21:26.250
- [Mikaila] No.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.243
- [Clayton] Here, hang
on, let me get this up.

21:32.171 --> 21:33.004
All right.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.910
Okay, I'm gonna be fine,
what, what will fix this?

21:38.910 --> 21:39.760
- Nothing.
- No.

21:41.260 --> 21:44.453
Don't say nothing, okay,
what will fix this?

21:45.350 --> 21:46.693
- [Mikaila] It's not like that.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.820
- [Clayton] When I am done
with this whole project okay,

21:50.820 --> 21:54.000
I, I will spend time in church.

21:54.000 --> 21:54.833
I will watch "Full House."

21:54.833 --> 21:55.920
- [Mikaila] Okay stop, stop.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.100
I don't need your sarcasm right now okay.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.693
Just, just let me feel how I feel.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.120
- Okay.
- Okay,

22:05.120 --> 22:07.440
I just want you to be real for a moment.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.590
- [Clayton] About what?

22:13.073 --> 22:14.491
- [Mikaila] What do you want?

22:14.491 --> 22:17.820
Okay, what do you want out of this?

22:17.820 --> 22:19.533
- [Clayton] I want us.

22:21.350 --> 22:24.130
- [Mikaila] You're gonna
have to explain that to me.

22:24.130 --> 22:25.570
- [Clayton] I just said it, I want us.

22:25.570 --> 22:29.560
Look I'm not even using the
misogynist answer of you,

22:29.560 --> 22:31.094
I want us.

22:31.094 --> 22:32.490
- [Mikaila] That doesn't
even make sense okay

22:32.490 --> 22:37.193
because as far as I'm
concerned, you have us.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.947
So, I wanna know what you actually mean

22:40.947 --> 22:43.060
when you say you want us.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.660
- It means I want us okay.

22:46.660 --> 22:50.000
I am not willing to give you
some dispassionate version

22:50.000 --> 22:52.650
of that person okay, some detached guy

22:52.650 --> 22:54.670
who gave up on every single dream

22:54.670 --> 22:55.700
straight out of the gate.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.520
I'm not gonna do that.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.223
You deserve better.

23:01.030 --> 23:03.611
- [Mikaila] Give me the camera.

23:03.611 --> 23:04.444
Give me the camera!

23:04.444 --> 23:06.110
- What, why?
- Give me the camera!

23:12.060 --> 23:16.990
Okay, Clayton I'm gonna ask you,

23:16.990 --> 23:20.350
one more time, all right.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.570
What do you want?

23:21.570 --> 23:24.400
What is the driving force behind this?

23:24.400 --> 23:27.350
What is bothering you so
much that you feel like

23:27.350 --> 23:28.930
you have to do this okay?

23:28.930 --> 23:29.853
Just say it.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.033
- My dad feels stuck at his job.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.647
He doesn't say it, but
he doesn't have too.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.913
I'm not gonna be that way.

23:47.910 --> 23:48.743
- [Mikaila] You love your dad,

23:48.743 --> 23:50.050
don't talk shit about him okay.

23:50.050 --> 23:52.113
- [Clayton] I love him,
I don't respect him,

23:52.113 --> 23:53.070
there's a difference.

23:53.070 --> 23:55.810
- [Mikaila] Your father
works a job he hates

23:55.810 --> 23:57.180
so he can provide for his family.

23:57.180 --> 23:59.243
How is he not a fucking superhero?

24:02.353 --> 24:04.273
- You just, you don't understand.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.180
- [Mikaila] So what are you gonna do now?

24:09.180 --> 24:11.060
- I've already told you, I'm here,

24:11.060 --> 24:12.390
you've seen this thing.

24:12.390 --> 24:14.350
I'm going to write a story.

24:14.350 --> 24:16.320
I'm gonna make a novel,
I'm gonna write it,

24:16.320 --> 24:17.580
I'm gonna make you proud.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.293
You are going to be proud of me.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.413
- [Mikaila] I am proud.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.219
(Mikaila sighs)

24:32.219 --> 24:33.052
Okay.

24:35.981 --> 24:37.731
- Give me the camera.

24:39.750 --> 24:44.750
- [Mikaila] Look, I know
how you're feeling Clayton.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.310
All right, you want, you wanna be great.

24:48.310 --> 24:49.203
Everyone does.

24:50.039 --> 24:51.042
- Put the camera down.

24:51.042 --> 24:52.023
- [Mikaila] No, no!

24:53.160 --> 24:55.280
You wanna be great okay,

24:55.280 --> 24:56.580
you're gonna listen to me.

25:01.170 --> 25:02.980
You see people post things online

25:05.200 --> 25:09.442
and you think they're happy,
but they're only posting

25:09.442 --> 25:11.003
the highlight reels.

25:12.860 --> 25:16.913
But you look at them, and you
think you're not good enough.

25:18.119 --> 25:19.060
- Put it down.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.400
- [Mikaila] You are.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.493
You are good enough.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.250
Watch this in a couple of days

25:29.250 --> 25:30.963
and see if you believe yourself.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.960
- Come here.
- Come here.

25:46.797 --> 25:50.685
- I love you.
- I love you too.

25:50.685 --> 25:51.720
- [Clayton] I love you more then

25:51.720 --> 25:54.373
the nostalgic memory
of a Blockbuster Video.

25:55.357 --> 25:56.939
- [Mikaila] I love you
more then peanut butter

25:56.939 --> 25:57.772
and chocolate.

25:57.772 --> 25:59.507
- [Clayton] That's impossible,
don't say something

25:59.507 --> 26:00.780
you can't take back.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.143
- [Mikaila] It's true, I do, I do.

26:08.541 --> 26:10.260
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.010
- I'll see you in a couple of days.

26:48.120 --> 26:48.953
Mikaila!

26:51.980 --> 26:53.103
So this is it.

26:56.370 --> 26:58.473
This is where I'll find myself.

27:00.699 --> 27:04.550
I spent all my graduation
money buying a camera,

27:04.550 --> 27:06.503
batteries and cards.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.503
I'm a fucking idiot.

27:12.460 --> 27:16.973
First night, it's not so bad out here.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.950
Just quiet.

27:20.950 --> 27:23.063
Besides the cicadas it's quiet.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.840
I can actually hear myself think,

27:28.840 --> 27:30.693
don't love it, but I can.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.103
It's definitely creepy out here,

27:39.390 --> 27:40.993
but I have to ask the question,

27:44.030 --> 27:49.030
would having someone with me
make it any less dangerous?

27:50.600 --> 27:55.600
And the answer is no,
but it takes being alone

27:56.710 --> 27:59.363
to realize you#'re afraid.

28:07.870 --> 28:08.703
Hello!

28:11.070 --> 28:12.253
Is anyone there?

28:15.410 --> 28:17.817
So, I survived the first night,

28:17.817 --> 28:19.623
er, I just ate breakfast,

28:20.500 --> 28:24.460
a granola bar which will also be dinner.

28:24.460 --> 28:27.750
Let me say one thing, this
is not the body of a man

28:27.750 --> 28:29.720
who eats two granola bars a day.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.523
This is the body of a man who
eats a granola bar as a snack.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.063
So, thoughts on last night.

28:39.783 --> 28:41.550
Er, one thing that comes to mind,

28:41.550 --> 28:43.653
one word would be aware.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.913
I was aware of every
sound that was around me.

28:51.850 --> 28:53.713
The trees blowing in the wind,

28:55.590 --> 28:57.630
the leaves skipping on the ground.

28:57.630 --> 29:02.630
Everything was so crisp,
honestly it was amazing.

29:08.434 --> 29:10.434
Well I am bored as shit.

29:11.910 --> 29:13.123
Look what I found.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.560
Bottom of the 7th, two outs, two strikes,

29:17.560 --> 29:19.773
no balls, men on 2nd and 3rd.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.500
And the pitch.

29:22.500 --> 29:27.160
Oh it's hit a mile high,
and three miles long.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.940
Yes it could go all the way.

29:30.940 --> 29:33.380
Upper decker, home run, and that pitch

29:33.380 --> 29:35.410
will sink Clayton into a month long binge

29:35.410 --> 29:39.093
of depression, alcoholism
and self-loathing.

29:41.261 --> 29:43.442
♪ Lumber jacking in the forest ♪

29:43.442 --> 29:46.200
(Ax smashes)

29:46.200 --> 29:48.133
That is not happening.

29:49.863 --> 29:52.040
(groans)

29:52.040 --> 29:52.873
Come on.

29:57.798 --> 30:00.465
(logs snapping)

30:10.139 --> 30:10.972
Huh.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.730
That is a creepy tree.

30:17.730 --> 30:21.160
These trees are monotonous.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.460
Be hell to get lost in it.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.490
I don't know, it's somehow
not as scary in the daytime.

30:28.941 --> 30:30.260
It reminds me of whenever
I was a little kid

30:30.260 --> 30:32.803
and I just ran out into the forest.

30:34.330 --> 30:36.340
Making up stories along the way,

30:36.340 --> 30:38.163
living my own little journey.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.253
Oftentimes being chased by something.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.350
A ninja, like all the time
actually, I don't know,

30:49.350 --> 30:50.733
what the hell that's about.

30:59.143 --> 31:01.393
I can make that jump right?

31:05.223 --> 31:06.306
You got this.

31:09.042 --> 31:12.359
(groans)
(water splashing)

31:12.359 --> 31:13.942
Ugh, it's so gross.

31:16.701 --> 31:19.034
What the hell water is that?

31:21.623 --> 31:23.540
Geeze, it's disgusting.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.002
(groans)

31:30.570 --> 31:32.963
Night's coming, soon enough.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.130
If you guys could smell me right now.

31:41.140 --> 31:42.530
There are no words.

31:42.530 --> 31:44.750
I used to be like bullshit, there's a word

31:44.750 --> 31:45.690
for everything.

31:45.690 --> 31:47.883
Nope, not this smell.

31:49.670 --> 31:54.060
Smells like two dead
animals crawled inside of

31:55.590 --> 31:59.053
three dead animals just
to shit, and then die.

32:00.510 --> 32:04.860
It's night two, it's late, real late.

32:06.780 --> 32:09.050
Heard a lot of noises tonight,

32:09.050 --> 32:12.403
it's the longest I've ever
gone without seeing someone.

32:14.540 --> 32:17.590
I mean sure I've had those
days where I disappear

32:17.590 --> 32:20.250
into a sofa and binge watch 12 hours of TV

32:20.250 --> 32:21.833
while screening all my calls.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.770
I call those dark days,
but I also call them

32:27.770 --> 32:29.600
everything I've ever wanted days.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.010
So new observation, there's a fine line

32:33.010 --> 32:34.560
between delight and depression.

32:39.430 --> 32:42.343
I don't know though,
this is just different.

32:46.754 --> 32:50.034
(distant banging)

32:50.034 --> 32:51.367
Nothing's there.

32:52.295 --> 32:53.628
Nothing's there.

32:55.255 --> 32:57.255
(sighs)

33:10.015 --> 33:13.182
(phone ringing)
Fuck!

33:29.510 --> 33:30.343
Hello.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.940
Are you kidding me Mikaila?

33:34.940 --> 33:36.470
Are you kidding me?

33:36.470 --> 33:39.310
No, no this is not cool, this is not cool.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.563
Yes I'm fine, you have to quit worrying.

33:42.610 --> 33:43.980
What, when, when?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.400
No I will not calm down okay.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.100
Okay, I will not calm down.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.620
No, do not assume the worst
whenever you call back okay,

33:51.620 --> 33:55.013
because this phone is gonna
be in pieces on the dirt.

33:55.013 --> 33:57.270
(phone slams)

33:57.270 --> 33:58.793
My heartbeat hasn't slowed.

34:00.390 --> 34:05.390
So Mikaila snuck in a
burner phone into my bag

34:05.620 --> 34:06.973
whenever I was gassing up.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.473
She also left this,

34:13.170 --> 34:15.469
some sort of memory card
or something to play.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.893
Anyway, cheap scare of the night.

34:19.810 --> 34:20.643
Moving on.

34:23.659 --> 34:25.483
I keep hearing those noises though.

34:28.090 --> 34:29.572
Sounds like footsteps.

34:31.739 --> 34:36.143
I have this theory about pushing
the limit of sleeplessness.

34:37.610 --> 34:40.150
It goes like this, when
you stay awake longer

34:40.150 --> 34:43.620
then you're used too,
your brain being such

34:43.620 --> 34:47.293
a powerful and mysterious
thing that it is,

34:48.210 --> 34:51.620
it becomes aware that you're tired.

34:51.620 --> 34:54.172
And the brain being the powerful,

34:54.172 --> 34:56.983
and mysterious thing that it is,

34:58.200 --> 34:59.513
it compensates.

35:00.970 --> 35:04.360
What I've found is it overcompensates,

35:04.360 --> 35:09.360
creating some sort of a
heightened creative state.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.540
So I might just stay up writing all night.

35:16.690 --> 35:17.523
Well I, (sighs).

35:20.240 --> 35:21.763
I won't bore you with this.

35:29.940 --> 35:30.773
Hello!

35:34.160 --> 35:35.683
Hello, is anyone there?

35:43.095 --> 35:46.255
(twig snapping)
(leaves rustling)

35:46.255 --> 35:47.088
Fuck!

35:50.316 --> 35:53.103
Fuck, fuck.
(breathing heavily)

36:08.750 --> 36:13.683
I know it was an animal,
I just didn't see it.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.070
It was big, it was...

36:24.550 --> 36:27.350
You always feel like you're
being followed in the woods,

36:28.470 --> 36:29.303
you never are.

36:31.554 --> 36:33.154
It's just paranoia in the night.

37:10.511 --> 37:12.511
(sighs)

37:13.900 --> 37:15.273
Nothing's been touched.

37:19.690 --> 37:22.133
A couple of weeks ago I had a dream,

37:23.690 --> 37:26.320
and in this dream I was
writing a short story

37:26.320 --> 37:29.100
about this character that was going crazy

37:29.100 --> 37:32.870
because of this dark, shadowy entity

37:32.870 --> 37:34.770
that wouldn't leave him alone.

37:34.770 --> 37:37.110
And I'm laying on my stomach on the sofa,

37:37.110 --> 37:39.783
typing on my laptop,
and then I fell asleep.

37:43.730 --> 37:45.130
And that's when it happened.

37:48.040 --> 37:53.040
I woke up to something slowly pulling me,

37:53.770 --> 37:58.510
and the second that I
became aware of what it was,

37:58.510 --> 38:00.893
it yanked me off the sofa.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.990
And I flew upright, and I was levitating,

38:04.990 --> 38:09.363
my feet were off the
ground, and I was frozen.

38:11.780 --> 38:15.220
And I tried to scream,
but the second I tried

38:16.210 --> 38:19.963
the most unbelievably tight
grip came around my throat.

38:22.210 --> 38:23.823
And it all went blurry.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.123
And then I woke up.

38:28.820 --> 38:33.603
I woke up in the exact same
place I had fallen asleep.

38:37.540 --> 38:40.010
If immersing myself in
this terrifying world

38:40.010 --> 38:43.580
can effect me that much,
down deep there is a story

38:43.580 --> 38:44.763
waiting to be found.

38:45.670 --> 38:47.453
Kinda scared to fall asleep now.

38:49.263 --> 38:51.183
I was hoping you could
keep my company though.

38:55.514 --> 38:56.530
What was it?

38:56.530 --> 38:59.973
My mom used to quote this
verse from Joshua something.

39:02.487 --> 39:04.067
"Be strong and courageous.

39:04.067 --> 39:07.047
"Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed,

39:07.047 --> 39:08.607
"for the Lord, your God is with you,

39:08.607 --> 39:09.677
"wherever you go."

39:16.441 --> 39:20.691
Everything's gonna be fine,
I know that, I know it.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.560
Everything's fine.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.858
My uncle, he used to say that,

39:31.858 --> 39:34.257
"If you live close enough to people

39:34.257 --> 39:36.937
"where you can't scream
at the end of a bad day

39:36.937 --> 39:39.557
"without getting in trouble then you live

39:39.557 --> 39:41.057
"too close to people."

39:45.610 --> 39:47.353
My uncle was a fucking liar.

40:03.690 --> 40:08.690
So, the sun is offensively
bright in the morning,

40:11.840 --> 40:14.343
it's like a big old fuck you from nature.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.353
But I survived night two.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.210
Yay.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.390
Being out here I've
really gotten to recall

40:29.390 --> 40:32.040
some memories I'm pretty
sure I would have forgotten.

40:33.600 --> 40:37.020
Once again it comes back to this idea

40:37.020 --> 40:39.720
that I can't shake, that
we're just surrounded

40:39.720 --> 40:42.130
by so much noise, and
we don't get the time

40:42.130 --> 40:45.163
to even exercise these great memories.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.800
Anyway, the last couple
hours I've been thinking

40:50.800 --> 40:53.603
about some of the funniest
stories of my life.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.063
Kinda makes me wish I had journaled more.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.013
I've had too good of a life not too.

41:07.710 --> 41:09.275
One story though,

41:09.275 --> 41:12.620
um it was the first camping trip

41:12.620 --> 41:15.060
that we had ever taken, we went camping,

41:15.060 --> 41:17.673
we went on this drunk
hike through the forest.

41:18.895 --> 41:21.470
And we ended up on this gravel road,

41:21.470 --> 41:25.090
not a car, not a sound for miles.

41:25.090 --> 41:27.900
And then all of a sudden, Hunter said it,

41:27.900 --> 41:29.267
he said "Guys, guys, turn off your lights,

41:29.267 --> 41:30.876
"turn off your lights."

41:30.876 --> 41:32.900
So we did, we all ducked
down on the gravel road,

41:32.900 --> 41:34.163
we were scared.

41:36.473 --> 41:38.020
And we said "What's up, what's going on?"

41:38.020 --> 41:41.613
He said, "This is life.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.373
"Dark, unsure, uncertain,

41:47.357 --> 41:51.023
"and you can sit here
and not become a man,

41:52.027 --> 41:53.877
"or you can walk towards it."

41:55.334 --> 41:59.100
And we all said, "Hunter you've
probably drank too much."

41:59.100 --> 42:02.557
But he stood up, and he said "No, no,

42:02.557 --> 42:05.347
"I am seriously, be seriously,

42:05.347 --> 42:07.337
"I am seriously right now."

42:09.730 --> 42:12.447
He said, "This is how
I wanna live my life.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.290
"I wanna sprint towards life."

42:15.290 --> 42:19.737
And so he said, "You assholes
keep off your flashlights."

42:20.815 --> 42:24.293
And then he sprinted.

42:25.230 --> 42:27.233
He sprinted as fast as he could,

42:29.130 --> 42:30.193
for a long time.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.963
And then we hear it.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.172
Thud, "Ah shit."

42:37.172 --> 42:40.050
(laughs)

42:40.050 --> 42:43.300
He had ran directly off
the road and into a tree,

42:43.300 --> 42:46.963
and then fell into a giant pile of thorns.

42:48.530 --> 42:51.520
And the whole time we
were walking him back

42:51.520 --> 42:55.440
he just kept saying
"That's life, that's life.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.687
"Life is hard."

42:59.470 --> 43:02.463
I know I'm telling that story
to nobody right now, but,

43:04.873 --> 43:06.903
any excuse to tell it.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.810
So I just got back to the campsite

43:14.810 --> 43:18.223
and something got into my food.

43:19.870 --> 43:23.610
On top of that, there
is a hole in the bottom

43:23.610 --> 43:25.253
of my water jug.

43:26.850 --> 43:29.343
So that's where we're at.

43:36.271 --> 43:38.050
(sighs)

43:38.050 --> 43:41.583
Hey friends, I found the
story I wanna write about.

43:42.560 --> 43:46.023
It involves a protagonist
who's a little bit lonely.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.460
I don't know, I've always been taught

43:52.460 --> 43:53.723
you write what you feel.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.000
You write what you feel,
or you write something

43:59.000 --> 44:00.453
that doesn't mean anything.

44:04.300 --> 44:07.490
And I think honestly,
if I can somehow isolate

44:07.490 --> 44:10.143
fear with my protagonist,

44:13.880 --> 44:16.213
I think I'll have the
story I'm looking for.

44:18.870 --> 44:23.870
A character with only his
own thoughts to believe in,

44:24.940 --> 44:26.340
that's what I'm looking for.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.833
Fuck, I've never been able to
get inspired in the daytime.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.963
I always get sidetracked and watch TV.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.213
Well I think that fits my
theory about creativity.

44:47.660 --> 44:52.660
It'll come at night, so until then,

44:53.853 --> 44:55.520
I'll just wait.

44:59.407 --> 45:02.240
(distant banging)

45:09.209 --> 45:10.626
I have to see it.

45:31.449 --> 45:33.791
(distant banging)
(gasps)

45:33.791 --> 45:34.708
What is it?

45:38.329 --> 45:41.329
(breathing heavily)

45:46.991 --> 45:50.741
(distant banging)
What is...

46:02.843 --> 46:07.843
(creature growls)
(Clayton yells)

46:17.929 --> 46:18.933
It's the third night,

46:20.060 --> 46:23.573
heard footsteps since about nine o'clock.

46:25.430 --> 46:26.480
They haven't stopped.

46:31.828 --> 46:32.995
I can't leave.

46:36.050 --> 46:37.783
This has to be some sick joke.

46:40.800 --> 46:42.370
At this point I'm just,

46:42.370 --> 46:45.890
I'm, I'm talking just to not hear silence.

46:45.890 --> 46:50.060
Disregard any and all
bullshit I speak about okay.

46:50.060 --> 46:52.860
I might tell a story,
I might create a story,

46:52.860 --> 46:54.930
I might sing a fucking nursery rhyme.

46:54.930 --> 46:57.800
I don't, I don't know,
I might talk even though

46:57.800 --> 46:59.650
I don't know what I'm fucking saying.

47:00.870 --> 47:05.870
I know my sensitivity to
noise is heightened out here,

47:08.617 --> 47:09.717
but I heard something.

47:17.260 --> 47:18.093
Hello!

47:21.250 --> 47:22.353
Is anyone there?

47:31.282 --> 47:32.704
(creature growling)

47:32.704 --> 47:33.537
Stop it!

47:36.304 --> 47:37.137
Shit!

47:39.541 --> 47:41.941
(breathing heavily)

47:41.941 --> 47:42.774
Oh my God!

47:49.270 --> 47:50.660
What the fuck was that?

47:55.110 --> 47:56.253
I'm not going back.

48:00.110 --> 48:01.850
I'm not going back I don't care.

48:04.624 --> 48:06.703
I don't care, I'm not going back.

48:07.780 --> 48:08.950
I'm not going back.

48:51.830 --> 48:54.103
At this point I wanna run into somebody.

48:57.780 --> 48:59.930
I wanna know what I'm
fucking running from!

49:13.403 --> 49:17.153
I've been walking for
two or three hours now.

49:24.443 --> 49:25.276
I...

49:26.230 --> 49:30.913
I haven't seen a road or a house,

49:34.830 --> 49:36.157
or heard a car.

49:38.923 --> 49:40.840
Everything is the same.

49:41.984 --> 49:45.003
(Clayton sobs)

49:45.003 --> 49:45.920
Where am I?

50:27.322 --> 50:28.155
I'm done.

51:38.348 --> 51:41.348
(breathing heavily)

51:43.607 --> 51:45.857
There's a cabin, there's a cabin!

51:45.857 --> 51:47.190
There's a cabin.

52:11.393 --> 52:13.476
(groans)

52:16.097 --> 52:16.930
What the fuck?

52:26.680 --> 52:28.220
What is this place?

52:34.897 --> 52:35.730
Is this a Bible?

53:24.566 --> 53:26.649
(groans)

53:28.970 --> 53:31.393
The creepiest place I have ever seen.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.973
Six chairs in a perfect circle.

53:41.425 --> 53:43.070
(indistinct rumbling)

53:43.070 --> 53:44.343
Is anyone there?

53:51.050 --> 53:52.313
I'm gonna die here.

53:56.597 --> 53:59.817
"Be strong and courageous.

53:59.817 --> 54:03.377
"Do not be frightened
and do not be dismayed,

54:03.377 --> 54:06.588
"for the Lord your God is
with you where you go."

54:06.588 --> 54:08.838
(wretches)

54:22.124 --> 54:26.207
(groans)
(sobs)

55:13.071 --> 55:16.321
(electronic crackling)

55:24.314 --> 55:25.481
Hold me truth.

55:38.757 --> 55:42.127
"In the beginning there was nothing,

55:42.127 --> 55:44.823
"and yet though the savior
worshiped it wholly.

55:46.687 --> 55:50.633
"He prayed to nothing, for
nothing to return eternally.

55:52.817 --> 55:56.057
"We pursued daily his acceptance,

55:56.057 --> 56:01.057
"and aspire to one day
become nothing as he did.

56:06.015 --> 56:09.265
(floorboards creaking)

56:14.830 --> 56:18.095
Yep, I'm back at the campsite.

56:18.095 --> 56:20.178
(laughs)

56:21.200 --> 56:22.723
Why am I here?

56:25.994 --> 56:28.660
Well one time I ate gas station sushi.

56:28.660 --> 56:30.793
Man do I make good decisions.

56:32.460 --> 56:36.133
It's like I run a fucking
irresponsibility brothel.

56:41.200 --> 56:44.933
I, I cannot leave.

56:46.100 --> 56:51.100
She knows where I am by
GPS, I cannot fucking leave.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.703
If I die, I die.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.683
Everybody does.

57:03.690 --> 57:08.050
Everybody that ever existed
before 150 years ago,

57:08.050 --> 57:08.893
they all did it.

57:10.213 --> 57:11.046
It's one, fuck...

57:11.046 --> 57:14.810
It's one of the only things
that we have in common,

57:14.810 --> 57:17.760
we're not all white, we're not all black,

57:17.760 --> 57:20.023
we're not all tall, we're not all short.

57:22.740 --> 57:23.733
But we all die.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.993
Somehow that's comforting.

57:35.787 --> 57:37.704
Mikaila, where are you?

57:40.271 --> 57:42.188
There's something here.

57:43.410 --> 57:46.763
I haven't seen it, but
there's something here.

57:50.351 --> 57:52.670
(sobs)

57:52.670 --> 57:53.813
I can't leave.

57:57.430 --> 57:58.933
I just have to wait it out.

58:01.653 --> 58:03.003
Are you fucking kidding me?

58:11.490 --> 58:13.223
What should I do Mr. Red Dot?

58:19.413 --> 58:24.413
When I was a little kid, my
best friend was a pitch back.

58:24.508 --> 58:27.450
You know the netting that
throws the balls back to ya,

58:27.450 --> 58:29.323
his name was Gus.

58:31.120 --> 58:35.430
Gus was such an asshole,
he always tried to peg me

58:35.430 --> 58:38.173
with baseballs.
(laughs)

58:42.390 --> 58:43.293
That was funny.

58:44.840 --> 58:46.389
That was funny.

58:46.389 --> 58:49.133
Don't just, don't just sit
there okay, laugh at me!

58:54.709 --> 58:56.330
I'm sorry.

58:56.330 --> 58:58.253
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

58:59.410 --> 59:01.463
You're just so passive.

59:04.660 --> 59:05.643
So I am sorry.

59:09.990 --> 59:11.883
Do you accept my apology?

59:16.130 --> 59:18.623
Do you accept my apology?

59:20.452 --> 59:22.400
(laughs)

59:22.400 --> 59:23.830
If you're not gonna talk to me then

59:23.830 --> 59:25.180
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

59:28.890 --> 59:30.493
My first word was ball.

59:32.470 --> 59:34.510
I don't even remember when
I started playing baseball

59:34.510 --> 59:38.060
but I played it all my life,
all through high school.

59:38.060 --> 59:41.600
I was a pitcher, in high school we made it

59:41.600 --> 59:43.160
to the semi-finals.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.663
I'm one pitch away from
making it to the finals.

59:47.663 --> 59:49.250
There's a man on second and
third, and what do I do?

59:49.250 --> 59:51.393
I throw a fast ball right down the middle,

59:53.140 --> 59:54.403
three run home run.

59:56.020 --> 59:59.530
I know it seems stupid, but in high school

59:59.530 --> 01:00:00.903
baseball was life.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.690
So the whole rest of the hour and a half

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.630
all these people started coming up to me,

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.080
telling me what a good
job I did, and how lucky

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.373
this batter as that he hit a home run.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.553
I just wanted to be alone.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.590
Looking back on that day, right now,

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.493
it seems like a utopia.

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:28.733
Best day of my life.

01:00:33.809 --> 01:00:34.863
I guess I'll watch this.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.110
It'll at least give me something to do.

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.640
- So Clayton we hope you're
having an amazing trip,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.930
and I hope you're
finding all of the things

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.520
you were searching for.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.270
And we decided that after
our day of interviews

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.820
there was something we wanted to tell you.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:53.930
- Mikaila's pregnant.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.763
- What no,

01:00:54.763 --> 01:00:55.720
I am not pregnant.
- With my child.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.920
- Hunter take this seriously.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.753
- Okay.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:00:59.530
(sighs)

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:00.820
We love you.

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.653
Is that good?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.653 --> 01:01:03.097
That's it.

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:04.100
That's it, we love you.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.280
And er, I've never met
someone as dedicated

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.040
to making me laugh as you are.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.560
- Well, I, I wouldn't, don't lie to him,

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.460
I mean he tries really hard,

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.200
and that's what really counts.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.840
- No it's true, you do, you make me laugh.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.523
- You definitely try,
and that is so admirable.

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.740
But anyway, (laughs),

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.320
we know you can come back
with something great.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.990
Um, we know how capable you
are, and we hope you do.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.650
Um, but--

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.250
- We just want you to come home.

01:01:32.037 --> 01:01:33.500
- And to shave your
fucking depression beard.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.038
- Hunter.
- Yeah.

01:01:35.038 --> 01:01:37.563
- And one more thing.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.475
I just want this to be clear, all right,

01:01:42.475 --> 01:01:44.360
I would be perfectly happy with you and me

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.210
just bullshitting through life

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:48.873
if that was the only way to be us.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.153
I love you.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:01.381
(Clayton sobs)

01:02:21.982 --> 01:02:25.565
- Well it's night four,
wish I wasn't here,

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.113
wish I could go home.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.750
But I guess if I didn't feel this way

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.433
then the experiment
would be a failure right?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.883
That has been happening all night.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.820
They're just marching in a giant circle.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.220
They, they never stop,
they're never close enough

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.173
to be seen, it's fucking cruel.

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.400
I'm just, I'm just trying to keep my mind

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:11.883
busy you know.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.820
I'm scared to let my
mind become idle because

01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:19.663
it might not be mine again.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.823
I was wrong though, about fear.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.913
My new thoughts.

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.810
Mr. Red Dot, my new thoughts are that fear

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.163
is actually based in the mind.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.840
I mean what is scarier
then knowing your sanity

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.543
is actually crumbling?

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.140
I mean scarier then any
monster could ever be

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.270
because if you were chased by a monster

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.550
at least you can run.

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:12.180
But whenever you are
insane you have nothing

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.903
to believe in but your own thoughts.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.407
And they're lies.

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.087
They're lies, they're not even real.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.430
So you're more then alone.

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:35.736
(distant banging)

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:40.513
The next obvious sound I hear,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.850
I'm gonna sprint straight towards it.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.233
I don't care anymore.

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:58.270
(indistinct rumbling)
(groans)

01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.390
(Clayton laughs)

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.357
Where are you?

01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:08.884
Stop it!
(Clayton sobs)

01:05:08.884 --> 01:05:10.551
Why won't... Oh God.

01:05:37.569 --> 01:05:41.260
They only want me to finish the story.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.330
I know how.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.753
All the words are blurry.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.193
It's like my eyes won't uncross.

01:05:54.691 --> 01:05:56.774
(laughs)

01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:01.010
But nothing, nothing is there.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:02.533
Nothing is there I know that.

01:06:03.947 --> 01:06:05.590
But they, they, that's all that they want,

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.563
they just want me to finish the story.

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:13.790
And I want too, I just, I don't know...

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.306
I don't know if I'm ready.

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:25.233
(laughs)

01:06:30.837 --> 01:06:35.347
"Be strong and courageous,

01:06:35.347 --> 01:06:39.571
"do not be frightened
and do not be dismayed."

01:06:39.571 --> 01:06:42.404
(distant banging)

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.520
But they wanted me.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:57.523
They wanted me.

01:07:20.929 --> 01:07:23.303
I don't think it would be
that bad to die in your sleep.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.887
No anticipation, no fear.

01:07:29.753 --> 01:07:30.836
Just the end.

01:07:40.668 --> 01:07:42.467
(indistinct rumbling)
(gasps)

01:07:42.467 --> 01:07:43.300
Shit!

01:07:48.628 --> 01:07:49.795
What the fuck?

01:07:52.228 --> 01:07:53.895
How did that just...

01:08:27.698 --> 01:08:28.781
What is this?

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:44.131
"He who seeks good, will find good will.

01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:49.274
"But evil will come to
him who searches for it."

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:51.063
I can't speak.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:54.717
Every time I do they get closer.

01:10:08.218 --> 01:10:13.218
(distant rustling)
(breathing heavily)

01:10:21.779 --> 01:10:23.779
(gasps)

01:10:39.182 --> 01:10:40.849
Fuck, what the fuck.

01:10:41.758 --> 01:10:42.591
Fuck!

01:10:56.988 --> 01:10:57.905
Fuck, Fuck.

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:01.666
Fuck.

01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:11.875
I pray I'll die in my sleep tonight.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:14.000
Where are you?

01:11:15.694 --> 01:11:17.111
Mikaila, Mikaila!

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:25.723
I'm sorry dad, I could have
learned so much from you.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.880
You're a fucking superhero
and I hope you know that.

01:11:34.912 --> 01:11:37.412
Mikaila, I'm so sorry Mikaila.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:40.326
I don't wanna...

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.390
My mind is my own.

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.437
My mind is my own!

01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:57.689
My mind is my own.

01:11:59.612 --> 01:12:01.515
My mind is my own.

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:03.015
My mind is my own.

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:19.450
Oh my, what the fuck!

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:20.283
No!

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:25.633
Leave me alone, no!

01:12:29.035 --> 01:12:29.868
Oh my God.

01:12:33.254 --> 01:12:34.921
Just leave me alone!

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.033
Here I was trying to write something dark,

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.043
but I wasn't embracing it.

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:47.543
But here it is.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.580
I hope they'll be pleased.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.670
My mind is my own, my mind is my own.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.933
My mind is my own.

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.300
What happened here today,

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.850
what will happen to me tonight,

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:06.253
only those who pursue daily will know.

01:13:07.569 --> 01:13:09.654
(screams)

01:13:09.654 --> 01:13:12.147
My mind is my own, my mind is my own.

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:15.203
My mind is my only truth.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:19.693
Only truth, 11:27.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:23.083
Only truth, 11:27.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:47.000
(Clayton sobs)

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.093
Where are you?

01:13:56.497 --> 01:13:58.330
What do you look like?

01:14:01.473 --> 01:14:03.056
Just show yourself.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.743
What do you look like?

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.800
Just show yourself.

01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:21.540
Show yourself to me!

01:14:31.494 --> 01:14:35.244
(tense suspenseful rumbling)

01:14:58.555 --> 01:14:59.388
- Clayton!

01:15:00.513 --> 01:15:02.080
Clayton!

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.854
I looked for you.

01:15:04.854 --> 01:15:06.731
- Clayton!
- Clayton!

01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:09.648
- Clayton, where are you?
- Clayton.

01:15:11.451 --> 01:15:12.910
- He'd want us to finish it.

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.143
Mak, I promise.

01:15:22.828 --> 01:15:24.411
We found the cabin.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.473
That he stayed at um,

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.773
the third night.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.337
We still didn't find any sign of him.

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.240
Your mind is just a fragile place

01:15:43.371 --> 01:15:44.721
when you don't have anyone.

01:15:50.353 --> 01:15:51.936
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.683
- I want one thing to be said.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.433
He succeeded, he created something.

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:02.713
It wasn't worth it,

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.993
but his recordings said something.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.003
He thought his project
was about loneliness,

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.793
it wasn't.

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:21.800
- Can you say it?

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.023
Please.

01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:33.583
- It was the first night I ever met him.

01:16:38.648 --> 01:16:40.565
He tried to ask me out,

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:45.440
and after many failed attempts

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.440
he finally said, "We live
in a messed up world,

01:16:51.817 --> 01:16:53.663
"full of messed up people.

01:16:56.537 --> 01:17:00.177
"So why take the chance
and go through it alone?"

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.523
I said yes.

01:17:13.031 --> 01:17:15.031
I don't wanna say it but

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.103
he's gone.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.733
He's gone,

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.363
and I was here the whole time.

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:36.283
- But is too much silence a bad thing?

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:41.630
Are the mundane relationships that we keep

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:43.783
the only things weaving us to sanity?

01:18:02.235 --> 01:18:05.402
