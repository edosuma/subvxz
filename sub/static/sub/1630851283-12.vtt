00:00.834 --> 00:14.481
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
>> HER NAME-- HER REAL NAME-- IS
REALITY WINNER.

00:14.547 --> 00:21.488
SHE'S AN AIR FORCE VETERAN,
ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE, WHO SPENT
FOUR YEARS BEHIND BARS FOR
LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

00:21.554 --> 00:29.963
TO THE MEDIA.
DID SHE DO "EXCEPTIONALLY GRAVE
DAMAGE," AS THE PROSECUTORS
SAID, OR DID SHE REVEAL A TRUTH

00:30.029 --> 00:37.270
THAT DEFENDED AMERICA?
>> I'M NOT A TRAITOR.
>> THE YOUNG WOMAN, WITH THE
UNFORGETTABLE NAME, IN HER FIRST

00:37.337 --> 00:39.706
TELEVISION INTERVIEW, TONIGHT.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

00:42.008 --> 00:50.417
>> IS CHINA'S ECONOMY, THE ONLY
ONE TO RIVAL AMERICA'S,
UNDERGOING ANOTHER "REVOLUTION?"
>> CHINA GREW REALLY LAWLESSLY,

00:50.483 --> 00:57.157
CHAOTICALLY, IN THE LAST 40
YEARS, AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT TO
CHANGE.
>> THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR

00:57.223 --> 01:02.629
PRESIDENT BELIEVES CAPITALISM
HAS GONE TOO FAR.
>> PRESIDENT XI IS WITH THE
PEOPLE.

01:02.695 --> 01:08.768
HE IS WITH THE PEASANTS, THE
MIDDLE CLASS.
AND UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, HE
DOESN'T REALLY CARE SO MUCH

01:08.835 --> 01:12.172
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ELITES.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:14.441 --> 01:20.113
>> IT'S ABOUT THINGS THAT SHINE.
AND IT'S ABOUT THE THINGS, YOU
KNOW, THAT SCREAM.
>> SOME OF THE CLOTHES REALLY

01:20.180 --> 01:25.718
SCREAM, RIGHT?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> SOMETIMES.
>> THE VOICE OF GUCCI'S CREATIVE

01:25.785 --> 01:32.358
DIRECTOR IS A LITTLE OUT OF
TUNE, BY DESIGN.
SOME OF HIS LOOKS SEEM RIPPED
FROM THE BACK OF GRANDMOTHER'S

01:32.425 --> 01:37.897
COUCH, OTHERS FROM A RENO
CABARET.
WE WENT INSIDE THE OPULENT HOUSE
OF GUCCI TO ASK WHY.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.466
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:41.968 --> 01:46.172
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.

01:46.239 --> 01:59.219
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

02:01.087 --> 02:07.760
>> Scott Pelley: A STORY ABOUT
SOMEONE NAMED "REALITY
WINNER"<i> HAS</i> TO START WITH THE
NAME.

02:07.827 --> 02:12.565
HER FATHER, PLAYING ON THE
FAMILY NAME, EXPLAINED HE WANTED
"A REAL WINNER."
AND SO, "REALITY."

02:12.632 --> 02:20.907
MAYBE THAT STILL DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE, BUT IT IS THE LEAST
BAFFLING FACT IN THIS STORY.
REALITY WINNER BECAME AN

02:20.974 --> 02:30.183
INFAMOUS NAME IN 2017 WHEN SHE
WAS ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE.
SHE WAS HIT WITH THE LONGEST
SENTENCE EVER IMPOSED ON A

02:30.250 --> 02:37.924
CIVILIAN, FOR LEAKING CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA.
NOW RELEASED, SHE SPOKE WITH US.
DID REALITY WINNER DO

02:37.991 --> 02:45.698
"EXCEPTIONALLY GRAVE DAMAGE," AS
THE PROSECUTORS SAID?
OR, DID SHE REVEAL A TRUTH THAT
DEFENDED AMERICA?

02:45.765 --> 02:54.541
IT'S COMPLICATED.
LIKE THE YOUNG WOMAN WITH THE
UNFORGETTABLE NAME.
>> Reality Winner: I AM NOT A

02:54.607 --> 03:04.918
TRAITOR.
I AM NOT A SPY.
I AM SOMEBODY WHO ONLY ACTED OUT
OF LOVE FOR WHAT THIS COUNTRY

03:04.984 --> 03:15.061
STANDS FOR.
>> Pelley: WE MET 30-YEAR-OLD
REALITY WINNER AT HOME IN TEXAS,
AFTER FOUR YEARS BEHIND BARS.

03:15.128 --> 03:25.471
"ESPIONAGE" SEEMED SURPRISING
FOR A WOMAN WHO JOINED THE AIR
FORCE AT 19 AND WON THE AIR
FORCE COMMENDATION MEDAL IN 2016

03:25.538 --> 03:33.046
FOR "600 ENEMIES KILLED IN
ACTION."
SHE DID THAT AS A LINGUIST IN A
COMBAT UNIT FIGHTING SECRET

03:33.112 --> 03:39.185
MISSIONS.
HOW MANY LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?
>> Winner: FARSI, DARI, AND
PASHTO.

03:39.252 --> 03:46.125
>> Pelley: THESE ARE THE
LANGUAGES OF AFGHANISTAN AND
IRAN.
>> Winner: YES.

03:46.192 --> 03:51.798
>> Pelley: BUT HER DUTY STATION
WAS 7,000 MILES AWAY FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES, AT FORT MEADE,
MARYLAND.

03:51.864 --> 03:57.170
WHY ARE YOU AT FORT MEADE?
>> Winner: I'M NOT-- AM I
ALLOWED TO SAY THAT?
>> Alison Grinter: NOPE.

03:57.236 --> 04:01.874
>> Winner: NOPE.
>> Pelley: THAT'S THE VOICE OF
HER LAWYER, WHO HELPED HER STEER
CLEAR OF SECRETS IN OUR

04:01.941 --> 04:11.150
INTERVIEW.
WINNER WOULDN'T SAY IT, BUT AT
FORT MEADE, LINGUISTS
EAVESDROPPED ON COMMUNICATIONS

04:11.217 --> 04:18.124
IN AFGHANISTAN TO IDENTIFY
TARGETS FOR ARMED DRONES.
>> Winner: IT IS NOT SOMETHING I
AM ALLOWED TO DISCUSS.

04:18.191 --> 04:23.930
>> Pelley: SHE DIDN'T DISCUSS
HER MISSION WITH HER MOTHER,
BILLIE WINNER-DAVIS.
>> Billie Winner-Davis: ONLY ONE

04:23.997 --> 04:31.337
CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH
HER, DID SHE EVER LET ON HOW
HEAVY HER WORK WAS.
I'LL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE SHE

04:31.404 --> 04:39.912
SAID, "YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
WATCHING SOMEBODY ON YOUR SCREEN
AND THAT PERSON GOES 'POOF,'
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:39.979 --> 04:47.754
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT."
>> Winner: I WAS STARTING TO SEE
IN THE NEWS THAT OUR MISSION HAD
A VERY HIGH CIVILIAN CASUALTY

04:47.820 --> 04:55.395
RATING.
>> Pelley: SHE BEGAN TO FEEL
GUILT, WHILE BATTLING ILLNESS:
DEPRESSION, AND THE EATING

04:55.461 --> 05:04.771
DISORDER, BULIMIA.
SHE LEFT THE AIR FORCE FOR A TOP
SECRET CIVILIAN JOB AT THE
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AT FORT

05:04.837 --> 05:15.114
GORDON IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA.
BUT HERE, IN 2017, SHE SAYS,
WHAT SHE WAS HEARING IN<i> ENGLISH</i>
WORRIED HER FAR MORE THAN

05:15.181 --> 05:21.254
INTERCEPTS IN FARSI AND PASHTO.
>> Trump: IF YOU DON'T CATCH A
HACKER, OKAY, IN THE ACT-- IT'S
VERY HARD TO SAY WHO DID THE

05:21.320 --> 05:28.594
HACKING.
>> Pelley: THE PRESIDENT WAS
RAISING DOUBT THAT RUSSIA
ATTACKED THE 2016 ELECTION.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.365
HIS INTERVIEW WITH JOHN
DICKERSON WAS TYPICAL OF THE
TIME.
>> Trump: I'LL GO ALONG WITH

05:32.432 --> 05:37.470
RUSSIA.
COULD HAVE BEEN CHINA; COULD'VE
BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS.
>> Pelley: BUT IT<i> WAS</i> RUSSIA,

05:37.537 --> 05:44.677
AND THE N.S.A. KNEW IT.
REALITY WINNER HAD SEEN PROOF,
IN A TOP SECRET REPORT ON AN
IN-HOUSE NEWSFEED.

05:44.744 --> 05:54.087
>> Winner: I JUST KEPT THINKING,
"MY GOD, SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STEP
FORWARD AND PUT THIS RIGHT."
<i>"SOMEBODY."</i>

05:54.153 --> 06:02.462
>> Pelley: THE SECRET REPORT
SAID, IN 2016, THE RUSSIAN
MILITARY "EXECUTED CYBER
ESPIONAGE" AGAINST "122 LOCAL

06:02.528 --> 06:11.070
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS,
TARGETING OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN
THE MANAGEMENT OF VOTER
REGISTRATION SYSTEMS."

06:11.137 --> 06:19.479
IT WAS TOP SECRET, IN PART,
BECAUSE IT REVEALED WHAT THE
U.S. KNEW ABOUT RUSSIAN TACTICS.
WINNER TOLD US SHE WAS EXPOSING

06:19.545 --> 06:28.221
A WHITE HOUSE COVER-UP.
SHE PRINTED THE REPORT, DROPPED
IT IN THIS MAILBOX, ADDRESSED
ANONYMOUSLY TO AN ONLINE NEWS

06:28.287 --> 06:35.394
SOURCE THAT SPECIALIZED IN
GOVERNMENT WRONGDOING.
THE N.S.A. REPORT WAS PUBLISHED
A MONTH LATER.

06:35.461 --> 06:40.500
YOU KNEW IT WAS STAMPED "TOP
SECRET."
YOU KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT.
>> Winner: I KNEW THAT.

06:40.566 --> 06:50.176
I KNEW IT WAS SECRET.
BUT I ALSO KNEW THAT I HAD
PLEDGED SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, AND AT THAT POINT IN

06:50.243 --> 06:54.814
TIME, IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE
BEING LED ASTRAY.
>> Pelley: WINNER WAS CAUGHT AS
SOON AS THE TOP SECRET REPORT

06:54.881 --> 07:04.157
SURFACED.
THE N.S.A. COULD SEE ON ITS
NETWORK THAT SHE PRINTED IT.
SHE DROVE HOME TO A NEW REALITY.

07:04.223 --> 07:11.097
>> Winner: A PLAIN BLACK SEDAN
CAME UP BEHIND MY CAR, AND TWO
MEN IN POLO SHIRTS CAME OUT AND
INTRODUCED THEMSELVES AS F.B.I.

07:11.164 --> 07:18.504
AGENTS.
>> Pelley: A TRANSCRIPT SHOWS
THE F.B.I. AGENTS TOLD HER THE
INTERROGATION WAS "VOLUNTARY."

07:18.571 --> 07:25.478
AND THEY DIDN'T MENTION HER
RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
WINNER LIED ABOUT MAILING THE
REPORT, THEN CONFESSED, AND WAS

07:25.545 --> 07:32.685
ARRESTED.
THE GOVERNMENT HIT HER WITH THE
MOST SERIOUS POSSIBLE CHARGE:
ESPIONAGE.

07:32.752 --> 07:38.891
BAIL WAS DENIED AFTER
PROSECUTORS TOLD A JUDGE THAT
WINNER WROTE IN HER DIARY THAT
SHE WAS MAD ENOUGH TO "BURN THE

07:38.958 --> 07:46.432
WHITE HOUSE."
THEY SUGGESTED SHE MIGHT DEFECT
TO THE TALIBAN.
TO THE PUBLIC, THEY SAID THIS.

07:46.499 --> 07:52.038
>> Bobby L. Christine: WINNER'S
WILLFUL, PURPOSEFUL DISCLOSURE
CAUSED EXCEPTIONALLY GRAVE
DAMAGE TO U.S. NATIONAL

07:52.104 --> 08:00.112
SECURITY.
>> Pelley: BUT WHAT PROSECUTORS
CALLED "GRAVE DAMAGE" WAS A
BOMBSHELL OF TRUTH TO THE

08:00.179 --> 08:06.853
FEDERAL ELECTION ASSISTANCE
COMMISSION, WHICH HELPS SECURE
THE VOTE.
IN HOURS, THE COMMISSION ISSUED

08:06.919 --> 08:15.528
AN ALERT ON THE "N.S.A. DOCUMENT
LEAK."
IT SPELLED OUT THE TOP SECRET
EMAIL ADDRESSES "UTILIZED BY THE

08:15.595 --> 08:24.537
ATTACKERS," AND URGED OFFICIALS
TO "CHECK EMAIL LOGS."
BLINDSIDED BY WINNER'S
REVELATION, THE COMMISSION

08:24.604 --> 08:33.880
CALLED FOR "FULL DISCLOSURE OF
ELECTION SECURITY INTELLIGENCE."
TWO FORMER OFFICIALS TOLD US,
REALITY WINNER HELPED SECURE THE

08:33.946 --> 08:41.587
2018 MIDTERM ELECTION.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU
LEARNED ABOUT THE ESPIONAGE
CHARGE IS THAT, IN COURT, YOU'RE

08:41.654 --> 08:49.629
NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
YOU LEAKED OR WHY YOU LEAKED IT.
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD THE
JUDGE?

08:49.695 --> 09:00.206
>> Winner: THAT I THOUGHT THIS
WAS THE TRUTH.
BUT ALSO, DID NOT BETRAY OUR
SOURCES AND METHODS.

09:00.273 --> 09:10.149
DID NOT CAUSE DAMAGE.
DID NOT PUT LIVES ON THE LINE.
IT ONLY FILLED IN A QUESTION
MARK THAT WAS TEARING OUR

09:10.216 --> 09:18.324
COUNTRY IN HALF IN MAY 2017.
AND THAT I MEANT NO HARM.
>> Pelley: BUT THERE<i> WAS</i> HARM,
FOR HER.

09:18.391 --> 09:25.965
AS HER CASE DRAGGED ON 16
MONTHS, SHE SAYS DEPRESSION WAS
CONSUMING HER.
HER MOTHER MOVED FROM TEXAS TO

09:26.032 --> 09:37.543
AUGUSTA TO BE WITH HER DAUGHTER.
>> Winner: THERE WOULD JUST BE
TIMES WHEN IT ALMOST WASN'T
WORTH IT TO SEE THE END OF THIS.

09:37.610 --> 09:49.322
AND SO--
>> Pelley: YOU HAD THOUGHTS OF
TAKING YOUR OWN LIFE?
>> Winner: YES.

09:49.388 --> 10:00.933
I STARTED TO PLAN MY SUICIDE.
AND I WOULD DO PRACTICE RUNS.
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS STOPPING
ME WAS MY MOM, BECAUSE SHE WAS

10:01.000 --> 10:10.309
STILL IN AUGUSTA.
MY DAD HAD GONE BACK TO TEXAS TO
GO TO WORK, AND I JUST REFUSED
TO LET HER HEAR THAT NEWS BY

10:10.376 --> 10:18.617
HERSELF.
SO, I WOULD GET ON THE PHONE AND
JUST TRY TO TALK AROUND IT AND,
"HEY, THERE'S NO NEED TO STICK

10:18.684 --> 10:25.091
AROUND.
VISITATION'S NOT WORTH IT.
GO BACK TO TEXAS-- JUST GO.
JUST GO."

10:25.157 --> 10:34.800
>> Pelley: HER MOTHER, BILLIE,
HEARD THAT, WHILE SITTING IN ON
OUR INTERVIEW WITH HER DAUGHTER.
>> Pelley: REALITY TOLD US THAT

10:34.867 --> 10:47.580
SHE WAS PLANNING TO KILL
HERSELF.
>> Winner-Davis: I HEARD THAT.
YEAH.

10:47.646 --> 10:56.122
>> Pelley: DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS
IN THAT MUCH TROUBLE?
>> Winner-Davis: I MEAN, THERE
WERE SOME VERY DARK DAYS.

10:56.188 --> 11:03.596
BUT THEN THEY WOULD BE FOLLOWED
BY A BETTER DAY.
I JUST KNEW, WHEN I WAS THERE IN
GEORGIA, I COULDN'T LEAVE.

11:03.662 --> 11:11.971
I COULDN'T LEAVE HER.
>> Pelley: IN 2018, AT THE AGE
OF 26, WINNER PLEADED GUILTY.
THE JUDGE SAID HE WOULD MAKE AN

11:12.038 --> 11:21.047
EXAMPLE OF HER.
SHE SERVED FOUR YEARS BEHIND
BARS, PLUS THREE, NOW, ANSWERING
TO A PROBATION OFFICER.

11:21.113 --> 11:26.285
SHE STILL CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE
CASE.
>> Winner: I'VE HAD FOUR YEARS
OF JUST TRYING TO SAY I'M NOT A

11:26.352 --> 11:37.830
TERRORIST.
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT
MY ACTUAL ESPIONAGE INDICTMENT.
OR HAVE A SENSE OF

11:37.897 --> 11:48.541
ACCOMPLISHMENT IN HAVING
SURVIVED PRISON.
BECAUSE I'M STILL STAINED BY
THEM ACCUSING ME OF BEING THE

11:48.607 --> 11:57.183
SAME GROUPS THAT I ENLISTED IN
THE AIR FORCE TO FIGHT AGAINST.
SO, I DON'T LET MYSELF FEEL
ANYTHING REGARDING THE ACTUAL

11:57.249 --> 12:06.459
ACT OR THE CHARGE.
UNTIL I CAN LET IT BE KNOWN THAT
I'M NOT WHAT THEY SAID I WAS.
>> Pelley: SHE SERVED HER

12:06.525 --> 12:13.566
SENTENCE DURING PRISON LOCKDOWNS
FOR COVID, AND THE UNREST AFTER
THE POLICE MURDER OF GEORGE
FLOYD.

12:13.632 --> 12:23.175
IN A CELL WITH TWO COMPANIONS--
DEPRESSION AND BULIMIA-- SHE
BECAME SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.
>> Winner: YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME

12:23.242 --> 12:31.550
THAT I HAD TO GIVE IN TO MY
ILLNESS, I PUT IT ON MY BODY.
I CUT MYSELF.
EVERYWHERE.

12:31.617 --> 12:38.524
I COULDN'T LEAVE MY CELL.
I COULDN'T WORK OUT.
AND ALL I COULD DO WAS ASK WHY,
AND ASK WHY.

12:38.591 --> 12:47.099
AND A CHAPLAIN WALKED BY, AND I
ASKED HIM WHY THEY WERE DOING
THIS TO US, AND THAT SAME
CHAPLAIN, THAT I HAD SEEN FOR

12:47.166 --> 12:56.709
TWO YEARS, LOOKED ME IN MY FACE
AND SAID, "NOBODY GIVES A
(<i> BLEEP</i> ) ABOUT Y'ALL IN HERE."
I STARTED GETTING HIGH THAT DAY.

12:56.775 --> 13:06.018
EVERYONE KNOWS THERE'S DRUGS IN
PRISON.
I WAS REDUCED TO BINGEING AND
PURGING, GETTING HIGH EVERY DAY,

13:06.085 --> 13:15.194
AND CUTTING MYSELF.
>> Pelley: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO
GET CLEAN?
>> Winner: I HAVE.

13:15.261 --> 13:21.867
I JUST AM ASHAMED TO SAY HOW
HARD IT IS.
>> Pelley: IT'S WORTH NOTING HOW
INCONSISTENT THE GOVERNMENT IS

13:21.934 --> 13:29.708
IN THESE CASES.
IN 2008, GREGG BERGERSEN, A
PENTAGON EMPLOYEE, WAS CONVICTED
OF SELLING SECRETS TO THE

13:29.775 --> 13:38.517
CHINESE.
THAT'S HIM, IN F.B.I.
SURVEILLANCE, GETTING HIS POCKET
STUFFED WITH CASH.

13:38.584 --> 13:49.128
HIS SENTENCE WAS SIX MONTHS
SHORTER THAN REALITY WINNER'S.
IN 2012, FORMER ARMY GENERAL AND
C.I.A. DIRECTOR DAVID PETRAEUS

13:49.195 --> 13:57.236
GAVE NOTEBOOKS OF TOP SECRET
INFORMATION TO AN AUTHOR, WHO
WAS HIS MISTRESS.
HE WAS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR

13:57.303 --> 14:03.709
MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION, AND NEVER SPENT A
MINUTE IN JAIL.
WAS IT WORTH IT?

14:03.776 --> 14:18.057
>> Winner: I TRY SO HARD NOT TO
FRAME THINGS AS BEING "WORTH IT"
OR "NOT WORTH IT."
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT I'M HOME

14:18.123 --> 14:30.302
WITH MY PARENTS, AND WE TAKE OUR
LIVES EVERY DAY MOVING FORWARD
AS BEING RICHER IN KNOWING WHAT
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR.

14:32.404 --> 14:39.245
>> Pelley: GRATEFUL, FOR THE
MOMENT, OF HER PRISON RELEASE.
WE SAID THIS STORY IS
COMPLICATED.

14:39.311 --> 14:46.452
ON THE ONE HAND, INDIVIDUALS
CAN'T BE DECIDING WHAT TO
DECLASSIFY.
ON THE OTHER, SOME THINGS ARE

14:46.518 --> 14:55.194
CLASSIFIED TO CONCEAL
WRONGDOING-- TORTURE, IN THE WAR
ON TERROR, FOR EXAMPLE.
IN A HOME IN TEXAS, ONE MOTHER

14:55.261 --> 15:03.702
HAS SIMPLIFIED THE STORY HER
WAY, WITH A PORTRAIT OF A
VETERAN, AND A DISPLAY OF A
COMMENDATION FOR MERITORIOUS

15:03.769 --> 15:12.745
SERVICE TO HER COUNTRY.
>> Winner-Davis: WHAT REALITY
DID WAS NOT ESPIONAGE.
WHAT REALITY DID WAS PATRIOTISM.

15:12.811 --> 15:20.586
SHE ACTUALLY STOOD UP AND WORKED
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO GIVE
US THE TRUTH ABOUT AN ATTACK ON
OUR VOTE, AN ATTACK ON OUR

15:20.653 --> 15:25.991
DEMOCRACY, AN ATTACK ON OUR
COUNTRY.
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF HER FOR
THAT.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.927
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:31.630 --> 15:38.137
>><i> HOW RECENT LEAKS OF</i>
<i>GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS HAVE</i>
<i>STIRRED DEBATE OVER THE</i>
<i>ESPIONAGE ACT.</i>

15:38.203 --> 15:44.977
<i>AT 60minutesovertime.com.</i>

15:46.412 --> 15:54.820
>> Lesley Stahl: THERE'S A LOT
TO WORRY ABOUT WITH CHINA THESE
DAYS: ITS MILITARY BUILDUP,
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES,

15:54.887 --> 16:01.860
INTELLECTUAL ESPIONAGE,
SQUELCHING OF HONG KONG, AND
THREATS TO TAIWAN.
BUT TONIGHT, WE FOCUS ON CHINA'S

16:01.927 --> 16:10.002
UNDOING OF KEY FREE MARKET
POLICIES OF THE LAST 40 YEARS,
THAT CREATED THE ONLY GLOBAL
ECONOMY TO RIVAL OUR OWN.

16:10.069 --> 16:18.110
IN A SERIES OF CRACKDOWNS
AGAINST CAPITALISM, STRICT
CONTROLS HAVE BEEN PUT ON
BOOMING SECTORS, HUGE PRIVATE

16:18.177 --> 16:27.486
COMPANIES, AND WEALTHY
INDIVIDUALS.
POLICIES ALL SPRINGING FROM THE
MIND OF ONE MAN.

16:27.553 --> 16:36.495
PRESIDENT XI JINPING IS
POSITIONING HIMSELF AS BIG OR
BIGGER THAN MAO, AND WESTERN
ANALYSTS VIEW HIS SQUEEZE OF THE

16:36.562 --> 16:43.902
PRIVATE SECTOR AS A POWER GRAB.
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE SPEED
AND THE FEROCITY OF THESE
CRACKDOWNS?

16:43.969 --> 16:49.641
>> Matt Pottinger: YEAH.
IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING, IS THE-
- IS THE AMAZING THING.
>> Stahl: MATT POTTINGER WAS

16:49.708 --> 16:56.482
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR ON CHINA, AND
NOW WRITES ABOUT CHINA AT THE
HOOVER INSTITUTION.

16:56.548 --> 17:06.258
TO HIM, THE RECENT CRACKDOWNS
SMACK OF MAOIST REPRESSION.
XI'S DEFENDERS SAY THAT HE'S NOT
KILLING CAPITALISM, HE'S JUST

17:06.325 --> 17:12.331
MODIFYING, GETTING RID OF THE
EXCESSES.
>> Pottinger: I'VE ALWAYS
BELIEVED THAT THE BEST

17:12.398 --> 17:17.703
INTERPRETER OF XI JINPING IS XI
JINPING HIMSELF.
>> Stahl: AND WHAT'S HE SAYING,
IN TERMS OF CAPITALISM?

17:17.770 --> 17:23.776
>> Pottinger: WHAT HE SAID, IN
ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT
SPEECHES, HE SAID, "WE WILL SEE
TO IT IN THIS LONG STRUGGLE THAT

17:23.842 --> 17:30.382
CAPITALISM DIES OUT IN THE
WORLD," AND THAT HIS VISION OF
SOCIALISM PREVAILS.
>> Keyu Jin: CHINA GREW REALLY

17:30.449 --> 17:37.623
LAWLESSLY, CHAOTICALLY, IN THE
LAST 40 YEARS.
AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE.
>> Stahl: ECONOMIST KEYU JIN

17:37.689 --> 17:45.264
SPLITS HER TIME BETWEEN THE
U.K., WHERE SHE TEACHES AT THE
LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, AND
BEIJING, WHERE HER FATHER IS

17:45.330 --> 17:54.640
PRESIDENT OF ONE OF CHINA'S
LARGEST STATE-OWNED BANKS.
IS XI JINPING KILLING OFF
CAPITALISM IN CHINA?

17:54.706 --> 18:02.648
>> Jin: PRESIDENT XI ENVISIONS
WHAT HE CALLS A "MODERN,
SOCIALIST ECONOMY" FOR CHINA, A
MUCH MORE RESTRICTED CAPITALISM.

18:02.714 --> 18:10.589
PRESIDENT XI IS WITH THE PEOPLE.
HE IS WITH THE PEASANTS, THE
MIDDLE CLASS.
AND UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, HE

18:10.656 --> 18:19.565
DOESN'T REALLY CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ELITES.
>> Stahl: HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS
ELITES BECAME CLEAR ABOUT A YEAR

18:19.631 --> 18:28.106
AGO WHEN HE HUMBLED JACK MA,
CHINA'S MOST FAMOUS BILLIONAIRE.
FOUNDER OF ALIBABA, THE
COUNTRY'S BIGGEST E-COMMERCE

18:28.173 --> 18:37.249
COMPANY, JACK MA HAD LONG TESTED
BEIJING'S PATIENCE WITH HIS
GLOBAL HOBNOBBING.
THE BOILING POINT CAME IN

18:37.316 --> 18:45.190
OCTOBER 2020, WHEN MA GAVE A
SPEECH CRITICIZING THE
GOVERNMENT'S RULES AND RULE-
MAKERS AS OUTDATED AND STIFLING

18:45.257 --> 18:49.528
INNOVATION.
>> Jin: I WAS SITTING IN THE
THIRD ROW.
>> Stahl: DID HE TAKE YOUR

18:49.595 --> 18:55.367
BREATH AWAY?
>> Jin: NO, I WASN'T THAT
SURPRISED, BECAUSE HE TENDS TO
BE VERY VOCAL.

18:55.434 --> 19:00.339
>> Stahl: HE<i> TENDED</i> TO BE VERY
VOCAL.
>> Jin: HE TENDED TO-- THANK YOU
FOR THE CORRECTION.

19:00.405 --> 19:08.280
HE TENDED TO BE VERY VOCAL.
>> Stahl: AFTER THE SPEECH,
ALIBABA HAD TO PAY A HEFTY FINE
OF NEARLY $3 BILLION FOR

19:08.347 --> 19:17.022
MONOPOLISTIC BEHAVIOR.
WORST YET?
MA WAS FORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT
TO CALL OFF THE $37 BILLION

19:17.089 --> 19:23.795
I.P.O. OF ANT, ANOTHER ONE OF
HIS COMPANIES.
AND THEN?
HE SEEMED TO VANISH.

19:23.862 --> 19:31.904
HE RESURFACED THREE MONTHS
LATER, IN THIS VIDEO, QUIET AND
SUBDUED.
BUT THE MESSAGE WAS LOUD AND

19:31.970 --> 19:36.508
CLEAR-- CHINA HAD HAD ENOUGH
WITH ITS INDEPENDENT TECH
SECTOR.
ARGUING IT DEEPENED THE

19:36.575 --> 19:45.017
COUNTRY'S WEALTH GAP,
AUTHORITIES FINED MAJOR SOCIAL
MEDIA AND E-COMMERCE COMPANIES
FOR SQUASHING COMPETITORS;

19:45.083 --> 19:54.560
DELIVERY APPS WERE CHASTISED FOR
UNDERPAYING COURIERS.
ONE BY ONE, THEIR C.E.O.s
STARTED STEPPING DOWN AND/OR

19:54.626 --> 20:00.432
DONATING BILLIONS TO GOVERNMENT
SOCIAL PROJECTS.
>> Jin: THEY ARE JUST DOING MORE
PHILANTHROPY "VOLUNTARILY."

20:00.499 --> 20:04.136
>> Stahl: I LIKE THAT YOU DID
THAT.
>> Jin: YES, NO, NO, NO, IT'S
TRUE.

20:04.202 --> 20:11.944
"VOLUNTARILY" DOING MORE
PHILANTHROPY.
TREATING THEIR WORKERS BETTER.
>> Stahl: TO THE WEST, IT LOOKS

20:12.010 --> 20:19.985
LIKE XI IS KILLING OFF THE
GOLDEN GOOSE, SABOTAGING WHAT
HAS MADE CHINA THE ECONOMIC
POWER THAT IT IS.

20:20.052 --> 20:26.291
>> Jin: THAT IS A COMPLETE
MISINTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS
GOING ON.
CHINA'S TACKLING THE MOST

20:26.358 --> 20:35.233
INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS OF WESTERN
CAPITALISM, AHEAD OF THE WEST.
THE CONCEPT OF REDUCING INCOME
INEQUALITY HAS TO BE DONE ALL

20:35.300 --> 20:42.074
OVER THE WORLD, EXCEPT THAT
CHINA'S JUST MUCH FASTER AT
IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THESE
POLICIES.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.811
>> Stahl: BUT ISN'T IT
COMMUNIST?
>> Jin: NO.
BECAUSE IT IS REALLY JUST TO

20:45.877 --> 20:50.582
GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE
MIDDLE CLASS, AND NOT HAVE THE
TOP 1% TAKE AWAY ALL THE
OPPORTUNITIES.

20:50.649 --> 20:55.120
THESE COMPANIES HAVE A BIG
CONTROL OVER-- OVER THE PEOPLE.
>> Stahl: AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT
WILL HAVE THAT.

20:55.187 --> 21:02.327
>> Jin: THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
TAKE THAT BACK.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Pottinger: THE PURPOSE IS TO

21:02.394 --> 21:06.898
INSTILL FEAR AND TO INSTILL
LOYALTY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE
LUCKY ENOUGH NOT TO GET PURGED
UNDER-- UNDER THE CURRENT

21:06.965 --> 21:15.807
CAMPAIGN.
>> Stahl: MATT POTTINGER SAYS
THE PURGE IS NOT ABOUT CREATING
A FAIRER SOCIETY, BUT OVER

21:15.874 --> 21:22.848
WHO'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT CHINA'S
CITIZENS-- THE COMPANIES, OR THE
COMMUNIST PARTY.
HE POINTS TO A LAW THAT TOOK

21:22.914 --> 21:30.055
EFFECT LAST MONTH, GIVING
OFFICIALS DEEPER CONTROL OVER
PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION.
>> Pottinger: THE PARTY HAS

21:30.122 --> 21:35.894
TAKEN A MACHETE AND SORT OF
WHACKED ITS WAY TOWARD THE
HEADQUARTERS AND C-SUITES OF ALL
OF THESE BIG TECH FIRMS, AND

21:35.961 --> 21:43.368
SAID, "YOUR DATA IS NOW OUR
DATA."
>> Stahl: DO YOU THINK THAT THE
PURPOSE-- THE PURPOSE IN A LOT

21:43.435 --> 21:49.374
OF THESE CRACKDOWNS, IS FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO GET THEIR HANDS ON
THE DATA?
>> Pottinger: THE CHINESE

21:49.441 --> 21:57.616
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THAT DATA IS
LIKE THE NEW OIL OF THIS
CENTURY, AND THAT-- THAT WHERE
THE DATA FLOWS, POWER WILL FLOW.

21:57.683 --> 22:06.858
>> Stahl: THE NEW PRIVACY LAW,
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CONCERNS,
ESPECIALLY FOR US IN THE WEST?

22:06.925 --> 22:11.963
>> Pottinger: IF YOU ARE AN
AMERICAN COMPANY OPERATING IN
CHINA, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAND
OVER YOUR ENCRYPTION KEYS TO THE

22:12.030 --> 22:18.770
CHINESE GOVERNMENT.
WHAT THESE NEW RULES SAY IS THAT
THEY, BY LAW, NOW ALSO HAVE
CONTROL OF YOUR DATA.

22:18.837 --> 22:25.610
>> Stahl: ONE REASON FOR THIS,
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, IS TO KEEP
CHINA'S DATA FROM REACHING
FOREIGN HANDS THROUGH THE

22:25.677 --> 22:35.320
PRIVATE SECTOR.
ONE COMPANY THEY TARGETED WAS
DIDI, CHINA'S VERSION OF UBER.
ITS APP AND FLEET COLLECTED DATA

22:35.387 --> 22:43.195
ON ITS PASSENGERS, AND ON
CHINA'S INFRASTRUCTURE.
DIDI'S PROBLEM STARTED IN JUNE,
WHEN IT HAD GONE PUBLIC WITH AN

22:43.261 --> 22:49.301
I.P.O. ON THE NEW YORK STOCK
EXCHANGE, BUT--
>> Pottinger: ONLY SEVERAL DAYS
AFTER THAT I.P.O. OCCURRED,

22:49.367 --> 22:55.240
BEIJING SUSPENDED THE APP,
BASICALLY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
PEOPLE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.
AND THEY SENT THE MINISTRY OF

22:55.307 --> 23:04.182
STATE SECURITY, WHICH IS CHINA'S
K.G.B., INTO THE OFFICES OF DIDI
TO START ASSESSING AND TAKING
CONTROL OF DIDI'S DATA.

23:04.249 --> 23:12.624
>> Stahl: IT'S NOT JUST DATA.
THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO CLAMPING
DOWN ON DAILY LIFE AND CULTURE.
THIS SUMMER, AUTHORITIES WENT

23:12.691 --> 23:20.065
AFTER VIDEO GAMING COMPANIES,
AND ENACTED SURPRISING
RESTRICTIONS.
THERE'S A NEW LAW WHERE KIDS CAN

23:20.132 --> 23:24.336
ONLY PLAY VIDEO GAMES THREE
HOURS A WEEK.
>> Jin: YES.
>> Stahl: AND THAT WAS JUST BY

23:24.402 --> 23:30.308
EDICT, PERIOD.
AND ONLY ON THE WEEKENDS?
>> Jin: THAT'S CORRECT.
AND I HAVE HEARD MANY OF MY

23:30.375 --> 23:36.047
FRIENDS INTERNATIONALLY SAYING
THEY WISH THAT THEY COULD HAVE
THAT, TOO.
>> Stahl: OH, YEAH!

23:36.114 --> 23:42.320
BUT IT WOULD NEVER WORK IN THE
UNITED STATES-- PARENTS DON'T
WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL US
WHAT TO DO.

23:42.387 --> 23:50.228
>> Jin: IT IS ANATHEMA TO MANY,
THE KIND OF PATERNALISM THAT IS
EXERTED ON SOCIETY.
BUT REALLY, IF YOU ASK THE

23:50.295 --> 24:00.372
CHINESE PEOPLE, THE MAJORITY,
THEY ARE VERY HAPPY WITH HOW
QUICKLY IT'S BEEN DONE.
>> Stahl: NOWHERE WAS THIS MORE

24:00.438 --> 24:07.245
OBVIOUS THAN WHEN THEY
DEMOLISHED THE GIANT, PRIVATE
AFTER-SCHOOL TUTORING INDUSTRY
PREPPING KIDS FOR EXAMS.

24:07.312 --> 24:16.054
PROFESSOR JIN SAYS IT WAS AN
EXAMPLE OF FREE MARKET
CAPITALISM RUN AMOK, DRAINING
THE RESOURCES OF PARENTS.

24:16.121 --> 24:24.496
SO, ONE WEEKEND IN JULY, JUST
LIKE THAT, THE GOVERNMENT
ESSENTIALLY OUTLAWED THIS ENTIRE
$120 BILLION FOR-PROFIT SECTOR.

24:24.563 --> 24:28.567
>> Jin: IF THEY'RE DETERMINED TO
DO ONE THING, THEY JUST DO IT.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
CAPITAL MARKETS, IMPLICATION OF

24:28.633 --> 24:33.872
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS.
>> Stahl: IN OTHER CASES, THE

24:33.939 --> 24:41.980
GOVERNMENT IS TAMING
CAPITALISTIC EXCESSES MORE
SLOWLY-- LIKE THE BLOATED REAL
ESTATE SECTOR.

24:42.047 --> 24:49.187
WE VISITED CHINA'S GHOST CITIES
EIGHT YEARS AGO, WITH THEIR
MILES OF EMPTY SKYSCRAPERS WITH
NO RESIDENTS, MALLS WITH NO

24:49.254 --> 25:00.532
SHOPPERS.
TODAY, THE GOVERNMENT IS
GRADUALLY DISMANTLING
EVERGRANDE, CHINA'S SECOND-

25:00.599 --> 25:07.038
LARGEST REAL ESTATE COMPANY,
WHICH OVERBUILT AND TOOK ON MORE
DEBT THAN ANY PROPERTY DEVELOPER
ON EARTH.

25:07.105 --> 25:14.045
BUT ALL THESE ACTIONS AGAINST
PRIVATE INDUSTRY ARE
CONTRIBUTING TO A SLOWDOWN IN
THE CHINESE ECONOMY, AND CAUSED

25:14.112 --> 25:20.218
GLOBAL INVESTORS TO LOSE MORE
THAN A TRILLION DOLLARS THIS
PAST SUMMER.
>> Weijian Shan: CHINA HAS

25:20.285 --> 25:28.426
DEVELOPED ITSELF BY EMBRACING A
MARKET ECONOMY.
IN ESSENCE, CAPITALISM.
IF THEY REVERT BACK TO THE

25:28.493 --> 25:35.433
CENTRALLY PLANNED SYSTEM, 40
YEARS AGO, IT WAS ALREADY PROVEN
TO BE FAILED SYSTEM.
>> Stahl: WEIJIAN SHAN SHOULD

25:35.500 --> 25:44.075
KNOW.
HE'S THE C.E.O. OF P.A.G., A
$45 BILLION PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM
BASED IN HONG KONG, WHERE CHINA

25:44.142 --> 25:51.516
HAS RECENTLY STIFLED DEMOCRATIC
PROTEST.
SHAN GREW UP DURING THE DECADE
OF MAO'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION

25:51.583 --> 25:59.157
THAT DECIMATED THE ECONOMY,
KILLING AND UPROOTING MILLIONS.
>> Shan: I WAS SENT TO THE
COUNTRYSIDE.

25:59.224 --> 26:06.364
MAO WANTED US TO LEARN FROM THE
POOR, FROM THE PEASANTS.
SO, I AND MANY OF MY PEERS WERE
SENT TO THE GOBI DESERT.

26:06.431 --> 26:15.674
WE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD.
ONE TIME, WE WORKED NONSTOP FOR
31 HOURS.
>> Stahl: BUT BY HIS 20s, CHINA

26:15.740 --> 26:24.215
UNDER DENG XIAOPING HAD ADOPTED
THE FREE MARKET, AND SHAN WENT
TO STUDY IN THE U.S.
HE EVEN TAUGHT AT WHARTON, AND

26:24.282 --> 26:32.791
TODAY HE'S INVESTING FOR
AMERICAN PENSION FUNDS AND
UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENTS.
I WAS ABOUT TO ASK WHY ANY

26:32.857 --> 26:38.630
AMERICAN WOULD INVEST RIGHT NOW
IN CHINA.
IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE.
>> Shan: WELL, INVESTMENT IS A

26:38.697 --> 26:46.805
RISKY BUSINESS.
CHINA, AS A MARKET, IS NOT FOR
FAINT-HEARTED.
>> Stahl: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

26:46.871 --> 26:54.913
THE LEADERSHIP'S GOING TO DO
TOMORROW.
WE'RE BEING TOLD BY ECONOMISTS
THAT THIS IS A MOVE BACK TO MAO

26:54.980 --> 27:04.155
ZEDONG'S STATE-CONTROLLED
ECONOMY.
>> Shan: I THINK THAT'LL BE TOO
FAR TO SUGGEST, BUT I MUST SAY

27:04.222 --> 27:12.230
THAT THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE DONE
IT VERY OFTEN IS VERY CLUMSY.
>> Stahl: THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT THE TENSION BETWEEN CHINA

27:12.297 --> 27:20.038
AND THE UNITED STATES IS RISING.
WE'RE CERTAINLY COMPETITORS NOW
IN A HEIGHTENED WAY.
SHOULDN'T THAT GIVE PEOPLE PAUSE

27:20.105 --> 27:30.749
ABOUT POURING MONEY IN?
>> Shan: WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.
CHINA IS THE HOLDER OF TREASURY
BILLS TO A TUNE OF $1 TRILLION

27:30.815 --> 27:37.455
U.S. DOLLARS.
THERE'S MORE CHINESE MONEY IN
THE UNITED STATES THAN AMERICAN
MONEY IN CHINA.

27:37.522 --> 27:43.561
SO, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES, WHO SHOULD BE MORE
WORRIED?

27:43.628 --> 27:52.537
>> Stahl: HE ARGUES THAT CHINA'S
ECONOMY IS STILL A GOOD BET
BECAUSE THEIR MARKET IS SO BIG,
WITH 1.4 BILLION CONSUMERS.

27:52.604 --> 28:01.479
AND THERE'S SOME MERIT, HE SAYS,
IN XI'S STATE INTERVENTION, IF
COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> Shan: I'M A FREE MARKET

28:01.546 --> 28:10.288
BELIEVER.
BUT NOW, CHINA HAS BETTER ROADS,
BETTER HIGHWAYS, BETTER
AIRPORTS, BETTER PORTS, BETTER

28:10.355 --> 28:18.196
BRIDGES THAN THE UNITED STATES,
A COUNTRY WHICH DAZZLED ME WHEN
I FIRST ARRIVED IN 1980s WITH
ITS INFRASTRUCTURE.

28:18.263 --> 28:25.103
BUT NOW, CHINA HAS A BETTER
INFRASTRUCTURE.
SO, THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PLAY.

28:25.170 --> 28:34.212
>> Stahl: IF XI IS ENGAGED IN A
CAMPAIGN TO SHOW THE REST OF THE
WORLD THAT THEIR SYSTEM GETS
THINGS DONE, AND ALL YOU GET IN

28:34.279 --> 28:41.086
THE WEST IS CHAOS-- IS HE
WINNING HIS CAMPAIGN?
>> Pottinger: HIS CAMPAIGN IS
BASED PRIMARILY ON PROPAGANDA.

28:41.152 --> 28:49.461
RIGHT?
PEOPLE KNOW THAT DEMOCRACY HAS
OUTPERFORMED AUTOCRACY FOR THE
LAST THREE CENTURIES.

28:49.527 --> 29:00.238
SO, WE'VE GOT TO NOT, YOU KNOW,
LOSE FAITH IN OURSELVES.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

29:01.639 --> 29:04.909
(<i> TICKING</i> )

29:07.479 --> 29:13.751
>> Sharyn Alfonsi: YOU DON'T
NEED TO SPEAK MUCH ITALIAN TO
KNOW THE WORD "GUCCI."
FOR 100 YEARS, THE BRAND, WITH

29:13.818 --> 29:19.157
ITS DOUBLE G. LOGO, HAS BEEN
SYNONYMOUS WITH OPULENCE,
UNDERSTATED LUXURY, AND
OVER-THE-TOP PRICES.

29:19.224 --> 29:24.095
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO ALESSANDRO
MICHELE, GUCCI'S CREATIVE
DIRECTOR.

29:24.162 --> 29:31.469
IN THE SEVEN YEARS SINCE HE TOOK
THE JOB, HE'S BLOWN THE DOORS
OFF THE LEGENDARY FASHION HOUSE.
MICHELE SWAPPED OUT GUCCI'S

29:31.536 --> 29:41.179
SIGNATURE SOPHISTICATION FOR
SOMETHING HE CALLS "BEAUTIFUL
STRANGENESS," AND TRIPLED SALES
IN THE PROCESS.

29:43.615 --> 29:52.957
FOR ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH, GUCCI
CLEARED HOLLYWOOD'S WALK OF FAME
OF TOURISTS AND TRANSIENTS, AND
REPLACED THEM WITH A SPECTACLE

29:53.024 --> 30:01.933
THAT SUITS WHAT GUCCI HAS
BECOME: A PRODUCT OF ALESSANDRO
MICHELE'S IMAGINATION, IN WHICH
TOO MUCH IS NEVER ENOUGH.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.805
>> Alessandro Michele: IT'S
ABOUT THINGS THAT SHINE.
AND IT'S ABOUT THE THINGS, YOU
KNOW, THAT SCREAM.

30:07.872 --> 30:12.010
>> Alfonsi: SOME OF THE CLOTHES
REALLY SCREAM, RIGHT?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Michele: SOMETIMES.

30:12.076 --> 30:19.150
>> Alfonsi: I DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU COULD BE A SHY PERSON AND
PULL SOME OF THOSE LOOKS OFF.
>> Michele: I THINK THAT FASHION

30:19.217 --> 30:27.458
IS TO LET TO THE PEOPLE HEAR
YOUR VOICE IN A WAY YOU KNOW.
>> Alfonsi: MICHELE'S VOICE IS A
LITTLE OUT OF TUNE, BY DESIGN.

30:27.525 --> 30:35.934
SOME OF HIS LOOKS SEEM RIPPED
FROM THE BACK OF GRANDMOTHER'S
COUCH-- OTHERS, FROM THE
DRESSING ROOM OF A RENO CABARET.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.474
IS IT ANDROGYNY CHIC OR CRUSADER
COUTURE?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE.
IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE

30:43.541 --> 30:51.549
HOLLYWOOD SHOW, WE WATCHED
MICHELE FUSSING OVER THE
FINISHING TOUCHES-- ADDING THE
PERFECT BAG, COAT, OR THIS, SOME

30:51.616 --> 30:58.089
KIND OF SKI MASK FOR A CYCLOPS.
WHEN WE WERE WATCHING YOU WITH
THE MODELS, YOU WOULD SAY,
"BELLA," IF YOU LIKED SOMETHING.

30:58.156 --> 31:02.994
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AND THEN, IF YOU WERE REALLY
HAPPY YOU SAID, "STUPENDO."
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

31:03.061 --> 31:07.799
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
HOW DO YOU GO FROM "BELLA" TO
"STUPENDO"?
>> Michele: BELLO IS-- THAT IT'S

31:07.865 --> 31:15.306
WORKING.
STUPENDO, IT MEANS THAT IT'S
MESMERIZE YOU.
IT'S-- IT'S SOMETHING THAT LOOK

31:15.373 --> 31:21.279
FABULOUS, YOU KNOW?
>> Alfonsi: DO YOU FEEL IT?
>> Michele: YOU FEEL IT.
WE FEEL IT BOTH, YOU KNOW?

31:21.346 --> 31:28.353
NOT JUST ME-- THE MODEL, AND THE
PEOPLE.
IT'S-- IT'S MYSTERIOUS.
BUT WHEN YOU GOT THE LOOK, YOU

31:28.419 --> 31:32.190
GOT IT.
>> Alfonsi: AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE IT?
>> Michele: YOU MUST CHANGE IN A

31:32.257 --> 31:40.565
VERY QUICK WAY.
>> Alfonsi: BUT ALESSANDRO
MICHELE'S INSPIRATION COMES
SLOWLY, USUALLY ON A DAILY

31:40.632 --> 31:47.972
STROLL THROUGH HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
IN ROME.
ITALIANS CALL IT THE
PASSEGGIATA, AND IT'S AS MUCH

31:48.039 --> 31:53.645
ABOUT SEEING AS BEING SEEN.
>> Michele: IT'S ALWAYS LIKE
THIS, THAT I WALK IN THE SAME
PLACE FOR, YOU KNOW, A MILLION

31:53.711 --> 32:00.485
TIMES.
AND EVERY TIME, I FIND SOMETHING
THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE BEFORE.
>> Alfonsi: WE WENT WITH MICHELE

32:00.551 --> 32:07.592
TO HIS FAVORITE PLACE FOR
INSPIRATION, THE PIAZZA NAVONA,
A MASTERPIECE OF BAROQUE
ARCHITECTURE.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.329
>> Michele: EVERYTHING IS SO
CINEMATIC.
LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S LIKE THERE IS HUGGING YOU.

32:11.396 --> 32:17.468
YOU KNOW?
LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF THE CHURCH.
IT'S, LIKE, SPECTACULAR.
>> Alfonsi: HE HAS AN

32:17.535 --> 32:28.246
ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF ROME'S
HISTORY AND ARCHITECTURE, AND
NEVER TIRES OF ITS SCENERY,
WHETHER IT'S THE FOUNTAINS

32:28.313 --> 32:34.085
SCULPTED BY BERNINI, OR FANNY
PACKS AND FLIP FLOPS WORN BY
PASSERS-BY.
SO, WHEN YOU SEE A TOURIST

32:34.152 --> 32:37.955
WALKING AROUND WITH SOMETHING
AWFUL ON, YOU'RE LIKE, "YES."
>> Michele: I ALWAYS TAKE A
PICTURE.

32:38.022 --> 32:42.393
>> Alfonsi: YOU DO?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Michele: I HAVE A LOT OF
PICTURE OF CRAZY PEOPLE IN THE

32:42.460 --> 32:46.497
STREET, YOU KNOW, THAT I GO
CRAZY.
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY INTERESTING,
YOU KNOW?

32:46.564 --> 32:55.673
IT'S-- (<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Alfonsi: MICHELE WALKS TO
WORK, FROM HIS APARTMENT IN ROME
TO THIS 600-YEAR-OLD PALAZZO.

32:55.740 --> 33:01.779
IT'S BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
DESIGNED BY THE RENAISSANCE
MASTER RAPHAEL.
THE MARBLE HALLWAYS LINED WITH

33:01.846 --> 33:09.387
ROWS OF GUCCI GARMENTS AND
ACCESSORIES IS A PLAYGROUND FOR
THE 49-YEAR-OLD.
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO

33:09.454 --> 33:16.994
HERE SAY THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN
EVERY DETAIL.
>> Michele: YEAH, YEAH, A LOT.
THAT'S A DISEASE, I THINK.

33:17.061 --> 33:25.436
>> Alfonsi: HE'S ALSO A
COMPULSIVE COLLECTOR.
WE SPOKE IN HIS OFFICE, WHICH IS
FILLED WITH ANCIENT ART AND

33:25.503 --> 33:31.075
MODERN KITSCH, AND HE HAS FOUR
STORAGE UNITS JAMMED WITH MORE
STUFF.
WHAT'S THE ITALIAN WORD FOR

33:31.142 --> 33:36.748
HOARDER, OR PACK RAT?
>> Michele: AH... CUMULATORE!
>> Alfonsi: CUMULATORE SOUNDS
BETTER THAN PACK RAT.

33:36.814 --> 33:44.288
>> Michele: MEANS THAT YOU PUT,
YOU KNOW, THINGS IN YOUR-- YEAH,
IT'S-- I THINK THAT IS THE
DISEASE OF COLLECTORS.

33:45.957 --> 33:53.364
>> Alfonsi: HE KEEPS A MENTAL
INVENTORY OF EVERYTHING IN THE
STUDIO, FROM HIS TAXIDERMIED
TREASURES TO BOWLS OF BUTTONS.

33:53.431 --> 34:01.305
ALESSANDRO MICHELE STUDIED
COSTUME DESIGN, AND THOUGHT HE
MIGHT WORK IN HOLLYWOOD BEFORE
HE LANDED AT THE LUXURY FASHION

34:01.372 --> 34:07.945
HOUSE, FENDI, AND LATER GUCCI.
TODAY, HIS LOOKS START WITH
SKETCHES.
THEN, THE OUTFITS ARE SEWN.

34:08.012 --> 34:15.920
BUT THE GUCCI MAGIC HAPPENS WHEN
IT GETS IN FRONT OF MICHELE.
TO US, HE SEEMED AS MUCH A
PUZZLE MASTER AS A DESIGNER.

34:15.987 --> 34:22.460
>> Michele: I LOVE TO BE OPEN TO
THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT IS THIS?"

34:22.527 --> 34:28.266
AND I START TO PLAY WITH THESE
KIND OF THINGS.
I LIKE THE UGLY THINGS.
>> Alfonsi: THAT'S RIGHT, THE

34:28.332 --> 34:34.672
FASHION DESIGNER SAID HE LIKES
UGLY THINGS.
>> Michele: MORE STRANGE.
>> Alfonsi: "MORE STRANGE," WE

34:34.739 --> 34:41.746
HEARD HIM SAY, AS HE NARROWED
HIS 200 LOOKS TO THE 115 THAT
MADE IT INTO THE HOLLYWOOD SHOW.
>> Michele: WE ARE SELLING THE

34:41.813 --> 34:49.220
DREAM OF FREEDOM.
IT'S LIKE A VOICE THAT IS SAYING
"IF YOU ARE LIKE THIS, YOU ARE
GOOD.

34:49.287 --> 34:56.227
NOTHING WRONG."
>> Alfonsi: MICHELE'S IDEA OF
BEAUTY AND STYLE IS NOTHING LIKE
THE GUCCI THAT DEFINED LUXURY

34:56.294 --> 35:03.367
FOR DECADES.
GUCCIO GUCCI STARTED THE COMPANY
IN THE 1920s, MAKING HIGH-END
LUGGAGE.

35:03.434 --> 35:11.542
40 YEARS LATER, GUCCI WAS BEING
WORN BY PRINCESS GRACE OF MONACO
AND JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS.
SLICK AND SEXY GUCCI RULED THE

35:11.609 --> 35:18.916
'90s.
BUT, IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED,
THE GUCCI FAMILY HAD SOLD ALL
ITS INTERESTS, AND THE BRAND

35:18.983 --> 35:27.358
LOST ITS MOJO AND MARKET SHARE.
THAT'S WHEN GUCCI'S NEW C.E.O.,
MARCO BIZZARRI, SHOWED UP.
THE IMPECCABLY TAILORED YIN TO

35:27.425 --> 35:32.930
MICHELE'S YANG.
AT FIRST GLANCE, YOU TWO LOOK
LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T GO TOGETHER,
RIGHT?

35:32.997 --> 35:38.636
>> Marco Bizzarri: TOTALLY.
BUT IN A WAY, WE HAVE THE SAME
LOVE FOR BEAUTIFUL THINGS.
THE WAY WE EXPRESS THAT COULD BE

35:38.703 --> 35:44.408
DIFFERENT, BUT AT THE END, THIS
IS GUCCI.
>> Alfonsi: BIZZARRI HAD A FULL-
BLOWN CRISIS ON HIS HANDS WHEN

35:44.475 --> 35:50.982
HE TOOK OVER IN 2015.
HIS TOP DESIGNER QUIT, JUST
WEEKS BEFORE A SHOW.
BIZZARRI COULD HAVE HIRED

35:51.048 --> 35:58.823
ANYBODY.
BUT PEOPLE INSIDE THE HOUSE
BEGGED HIM TO TALK TO ALESSANDRO
MICHELE, WHO HAD BEEN WITH GUCCI

35:58.890 --> 36:03.661
12 YEARS, DESIGNING HANDBAGS AND
ACCESSORIES.
>> Bizzarri: SO I MET HIM, IN
HIS APARTMENT.

36:03.728 --> 36:09.901
AND, IT-- YOU OPEN THE DOOR.
I MEAN, HE'S WEARING SOMETHING
THAT I NEVER SAW IN ANY SINGLE
THING-- IN-- IN ANY SHOP IN-- IN

36:09.967 --> 36:16.807
GUCCI.
SO THEN I SAT DOWN AND I WAS
LOOKING AROUND IN THE APARTMENT.
THERE WAS ALL THESE ANTIQUES AND

36:16.874 --> 36:22.013
BEAUTIFUL COLORS.
BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE.
AND-- AND AMAZING TASTE.
EVEN THE WAY WHICH WAS SERVING

36:22.079 --> 36:31.889
ME THE COFFEE WAS SO ELEGANT.
>> Michele: I FELT MYSELF VERY
FREE TO-- TO SAY EVERYTHING.
>> Alfonsi: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

36:31.956 --> 36:38.963
>> Michele: OH, I WAS SAYING
WHAT THE BRAND MAYBE WAS NOT--
AT THAT TIME, WAS NOT SO
RELEVANT.

36:39.030 --> 36:44.268
BECAUSE THE BRAND LOST THIS KIND
OF BEAUTIFUL STRANGENESS.
>> Bizzarri: SO I ASK HIM,
"LISTEN, IF I APPOINT YOU AS A

36:44.335 --> 36:48.973
CREATIVE DIRECTOR, ARE YOU
WILLING TO DO THE SHOW, THE
MEN'S SHOW," THAT-- WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN IN FIVE DAYS.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.710
>> Alfonsi: FIVE DAYS?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Bizzarri: I DON'T THINK NEVER
BEEN HELD IN FASHION HISTORY

36:52.777 --> 37:00.651
THAT SOMEONE MADE A SHOW AT--
FOR A S-- COMPANY LIKE OURS--
THIS SIZE, IN FIVE DAYS.
AND HE SAID, "YES."

37:00.718 --> 37:07.725
>> Alfonsi: THIS IS WHAT MICHELE
WHIPPED UP FOR HIS FIRST SHOW,
IN LESS THAN A WEEK.
NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

37:07.792 --> 37:14.932
>> Michele: WHEN I FINISHED
EVERYTHING, AND THE SHOW WAS
GONE, I WAS SO TIRED.
AND I SAID, "MAYBE THEY'RE GOING

37:14.999 --> 37:19.670
TO FIRE ME."
(<i> LAUGHTER</i> )
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S-- IT'S A JOB
THAT--

37:19.737 --> 37:22.373
>> Alfonsi: DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT?
DID YOU REALLY THINK--
>> Michele: IN-- YEAH, FOR A

37:22.440 --> 37:25.943
MINUTE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
BECAUSE IT WAS SO DIFFERENT, YOU
KNOW.

37:26.010 --> 37:30.548
>> Alfonsi: SOME PEOPLE WERE
LIKE, "DID GUCCI LOSE THEIR
MIND?"
>> Michele: YEAH.

37:30.615 --> 37:35.987
THERE WERE PEOPLE ON INSTAGRAM
WRITING THAT EVERYTHING WAS KIND
OF HORRIBLE, YOU KNOW?
THAT IT WAS NOT GUCCI.

37:36.053 --> 37:40.758
>> Alfonsi: DID YOU LOSE
CUSTOMERS AT FIRST?
>> Bizzarri: YEAH, I THINK SO.
YES.

37:40.825 --> 37:47.765
BUT WE GOT A LOT OF THE-- THE
NEW-- THE NEW GENERATIONS A LOT.
A LOT.
ACTUALLY, I THINK THE CHANGE IN

37:47.832 --> 37:54.605
AESTHETIC THAT ALESSANDRO DID
FOR GUCCI BROUGHT THIS NEW
GENERATION INTO THE FASHION
WORLD, THE LUXURY WORLD.

37:54.672 --> 38:01.912
>> Alfonsi: BIZZARRI'S BET PAID
OFF-- GUCCI SALES TRIPLED IN
FIVE YEARS.
WHO'S YOUR CUSTOMER?

38:01.979 --> 38:11.389
IS IT THE MOVIE STAR, OR IS IT
THE 19-YEAR-OLD WITH THEIR NOSE
PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS AT
GUCCI, THAT YOU'RE HOPING WEARS

38:11.455 --> 38:15.960
WHAT YOU PUT--
>> Michele: I DON'T KNOW.
>> Alfonsi: --WEARS WHAT YOU PUT
YOUR HEART INTO?

38:16.027 --> 38:19.764
>> Michele: I WAS THINKING ABOUT
EVERYBODY.
BECAUSE FASHION IS REALLY FOR
EVERYBODY.

38:19.830 --> 38:24.368
>> Alfonsi: BUT DOESN'T
EVERYBODY HAVE TO AFFORD IT?
>> Michele: I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, MAYBE NO.

38:24.435 --> 38:32.143
>> Alfonsi: NO ONE AT GUCCI
APOLOGIZES FOR THE PRICES.
THEY FOLLOW THE LUXURY BRAND
PHILOSOPHY: YOU CAN CHARGE AS

38:32.209 --> 38:38.182
MUCH AS THE BUYER IS WILLING TO
PAY.
AND FOR GUCCI, THEY DO-- BIG-
TIME.

38:38.249 --> 38:44.889
THEIR WOOL-LINED LOAFERS SELL
FOR ALMOST $1,000.
THE HIGHEST-PRICED BAGS,
$35,000.

38:44.955 --> 38:52.063
GUCCI MAKES MOST OF ITS MONEY
FROM LEATHER GOODS.
THEY GAVE US RARE PERMISSION TO
GO INSIDE A FACTORY OUTSIDE

38:52.129 --> 39:00.237
FLORENCE.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN OPERATING ROOM.
WE SAW BAGS THAT WERE HAND-SEWN
AND HAND-PAINTED.

39:00.304 --> 39:05.476
GUCCI SAYS ALMOST ALL OF THEIR
PRODUCTS ARE STILL MADE IN
ITALY.
AND, WATCHING THESE ARTISANS AT

39:05.543 --> 39:12.516
WORK, YOU CAN ALMOST START TO
MAKE SENSE OF THE HIGH PRICES
THAT MAKE THEIR BAGS ONE OF THE
MOST DESIRED, AND COUNTERFEITED,

39:12.583 --> 39:21.726
ITEMS IN THE WORLD.
THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, IMITATION IS
THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY.
BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOME FAKE GUCCI

39:21.792 --> 39:28.666
GEAR FLY BY, AND YOU SEE IT ALL
OVER ROME...
>> Michele: IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S
PRETTY CRAZY.

39:28.733 --> 39:34.839
I'M STILL DEALING WITH THE
COPIES THAT I SEE EVERYWHERE.
I THINK THAT MEANS KIND OF POWER
OF THE BRAND.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.775
>> Alfonsi: BUT, DOES IT UPSET
YOU?
>> Michele: NO, NEVER.
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE

39:37.842 --> 39:41.445
POPULAR.
>> Alfonsi: THAT YOU'RE
RELEVANT.
>> Michele: RELEVANT, YEAH.

39:41.512 --> 39:49.487
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE IN MUSIC.
IF SOMEONE IS COPYING YOU...
>> Alfonsi: IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU THAT GUCCI IS CONSIDERED

39:49.553 --> 39:55.760
FASHIONABLE, OR RELEVANT?
>> Michele: I WOULD LOVE TO SAY
BOTH.
BUT MAYBE MORE RELEVANT.

39:55.826 --> 40:03.868
BECAUSE I THINK THAT RELEVANT
MEANS THAT YOU ARE SAYING
SOMETHING, AND FASHION MUST SAY
SOMETHING NOW.

40:06.103 --> 40:13.511
>> Alfonsi: ALESSANDRO MICHELE
DIRECTED GUCCI TO GET HIS
MESSAGE TO YOUNGER CUSTOMERS
WITH ONLINE FILMS, RELENTLESS

40:13.577 --> 40:22.953
SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS, AND
SHOWS THAT BRING CEREBRAL TO A
WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE THE MODELS

40:23.020 --> 40:29.660
ARE CARRYING WAX REPLICAS OF
THEIR HEAD.
OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR JARED LETO
FOLLOWED SUIT, IN THIS GUCCI

40:29.727 --> 40:34.465
GOWN AT A CHARITY GALA.
>> Jared Leto: I CARRIED THE
HEAD AROUND.
BUT THE THING ABOUT THE HEAD

40:34.532 --> 40:38.035
WAS, EVERYONE WANTED TO PLAY
WITH MY HEAD.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Alfonsi: DO YOU JUST BRING IT

40:38.102 --> 40:41.705
OUT TO DINNER PARTIES OR--
>> Leto: I MEAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN
IT SINCE THAT NIGHT, BASICALLY.
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY HEAVY.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.575
>> Alfonsi: IT'S PRETTY HEAVY--
>> Leto: YEAH, WELL--
(<i> CROSSTALK</i> )
--BIG BRAIN IN THERE.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.444
>> Alfonsi: FOR AN ACTOR, RIGHT?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Leto: YOU KNOW, YEAH.
IT'S-- IT'S A VERY HEAVY HEAD

40:47.511 --> 40:51.949
FOR AN ACTOR.
>> Alfonsi: TODAY, GUCCI
ATTRACTS A BRAND OF CELEBRITY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY IT

40:52.016 --> 40:59.123
SAFE.
THINK BILLIE EILISH, HARRY
STYLES, AND SERENA WILLIAMS.
LETO PROMOTES GUCCI, AND WEARS

40:59.190 --> 41:08.032
IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE RED
CARPET-- AND, OF COURSE, WHEN
HE'S GARDENING WITH MICHELE.
>> Leto: HE HAS A GREAT SENSE OF

41:08.098 --> 41:12.169
HUMOR.
I'VE WORN, LIKE, A COUNTERFEIT
GUCCI SHIRT.
>> Alfonsi: WITH HIM?

41:12.236 --> 41:15.539
>> Leto: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND, HE SAYS, "OH, DARLING,
THAT'S FAKE."
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

41:15.606 --> 41:19.543
AND I'M LIKE, "I KNOW."
>> Michele: NOW, WHEN YOU THINK
TO GUCCI, YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN
LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN DIFFERENT

41:19.610 --> 41:28.152
WAYS, YOU KNOW?
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK
VERY POWERFUL FOR EVERYBODY.
BECAUSE IN THE PAST, I MEAN,

41:28.219 --> 41:36.760
FASHION WAS JUST ONE WAY.
>> Alfonsi: THE HOLLYWOOD SHOW,
WHICH TOOK SIX MONTHS TO CREATE,
LASTED JUST 22 MINUTES.

41:36.827 --> 41:44.368
RIGHT NOW, ALESSANDRO MICHELE IS
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DESIGNER IN
FASHION.
BUT HE'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL

41:44.435 --> 41:50.241
YOU NOTHING IS ETERNAL-- EXCEPT
HIS CITY, ROME.
YOU SAID AFTER THAT FIRST SHOW,
YOU WERE WORRIED THEY WERE GOING

41:50.307 --> 41:54.345
TO FIRE YOU.
>> Michele: YEAH.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Alfonsi: ARE YOU FEELING A

41:54.411 --> 41:57.214
LITTLE MORE CONFIDENT NOW?
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Michele: I LOVE TO FEEL
INSECURE, IN A WAY.

41:57.281 --> 42:02.152
IT--
>> Alfonsi: IT MAKES YOU
CREATIVE--
>> Michele: YEAH, IT MAKE ME

42:02.219 --> 42:05.623
FEEL CREATIVE.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE LIFE.
IT'S NOT FOREVER.
THAT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING,

42:05.689 --> 42:06.724
THAT NOTHING'S FOREVER.
THAT'S WHY IT'S PRECIOUS.

42:16.867 --> 42:22.940
>> Alfonsi: NEXT SUNDAY ON
"60 MINUTES:" JON WERTHEIM
VENTURES TO FOGO ISLAND, A
REMOTE SPECK OFF THE COAST OF

42:23.007 --> 42:29.713
NEWFOUNDLAND, WHERE STUNNING
BEAUTY COMPETED WITH ECONOMIC
STRUGGLE.
AN ISLAND-BRED ENTREPRENEUR

42:29.780 --> 42:37.955
RETURNED FROM SILICON VALLEY TO
UNDERTAKE A PROJECT AIMED AT
SAVING THE ISLAND'S LIFE, AND
CULTURE.

42:38.022 --> 42:42.459
>> Zita Cobb: WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLACE,
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE'RE
REALLY GOOD AT, IT'S

42:42.526 --> 42:46.830
HOSPITALITY.
>> Wertheim: WHAT DOES
HOSPITALITY MEAN HERE?
>> Cobb: HOSPITALITY, IN ITS

42:46.897 --> 42:58.842
PUREST FORM, IS THE LOVE OF A
STRANGER.
>> Alfonsi: I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WIT

42:58.909 --> 43:01.145
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
