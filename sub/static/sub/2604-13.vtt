00:00.033 --> 00:01.512
Previously on...
<i>Suits</i>

00:01.537 --> 00:02.757
We just went
through a civil war,

00:02.782 --> 00:03.763
and the world knows it.

00:03.764 --> 00:05.031
You're using
privileged information

00:05.099 --> 00:06.199
to target our clients.

00:06.266 --> 00:08.034
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

00:08.102 --> 00:09.782
I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

00:09.837 --> 00:12.271
I did nothing wrong.

00:12.339 --> 00:13.373
Jesus!

00:13.440 --> 00:14.707
You're the guy
that nobody wants

00:14.775 --> 00:15.842
but we can't get rid of.

00:15.909 --> 00:17.276
You order me to rescind
an offer

00:17.344 --> 00:19.045
due to a firm-wide
hiring freeze.

00:19.113 --> 00:21.047
Two minutes later,
you hire a fifth-year.

00:21.115 --> 00:22.181
Katrina Bennett.

00:22.249 --> 00:23.850
I need you to waive
my non-compete

00:23.917 --> 00:25.985
so I can take a position
at another firm.

00:26.053 --> 00:28.087
- You went to Louis?
- He didn't betray us, Harvey.

00:28.155 --> 00:29.856
He found the problem.

00:32.493 --> 00:33.693
You may have fended off
this attack,

00:33.761 --> 00:35.201
but we're not
the only ones circling.

00:35.229 --> 00:37.897
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

00:37.965 --> 00:39.899
I want my name
on the door.

00:49.877 --> 00:52.578
Nice!

01:00.421 --> 01:01.654
- Ugh!
- H-o-r-s.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.656
That means you get an "e,"
you lose.

01:03.724 --> 01:05.257
- Thank you. I can spell.
- Too bad you can't shoot.

01:05.325 --> 01:06.759
Crumpled paper.

01:06.827 --> 01:08.361
Winners don't blame
the ball or the rim

01:08.429 --> 01:10.029
or the wind speed
in a closed-off room.

01:10.097 --> 01:11.197
The fan was on.

01:11.265 --> 01:12.565
Excuses don't win
championships.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.033
Oh, yeah? Did Michael Jordan
tell you that?

01:14.101 --> 01:16.169
No.
I told him.

01:16.236 --> 01:18.738
Come on.
All right.

01:18.806 --> 01:21.374
That was going in.
We're in the middle of a game!

01:21.442 --> 01:22.475
If you two
are playing horse,

01:22.543 --> 01:24.110
then one of you needs
to thank me.

01:24.178 --> 01:25.578
Thank you.

01:25.646 --> 01:28.281
Pussies.
Out.

01:28.348 --> 01:29.482
Would you like to finish
this game?

01:29.550 --> 01:31.083
Winner gets to be
name partner.

01:31.151 --> 01:33.386
See, that's funny because
you're already name partner--

01:33.454 --> 01:34.987
Derek Portis died
this weekend.

01:35.055 --> 01:36.322
What took him so long?

01:36.390 --> 01:37.723
- Harvey.
- What?

01:37.791 --> 01:39.659
He lived a long life.
He was an old man.

01:39.726 --> 01:41.828
- He was 56.
- Didn't look a day under 70.

01:41.895 --> 01:43.496
Man dies,
and the first thing you think

01:43.564 --> 01:45.465
to say is that
he looked older than he was.

01:45.532 --> 01:46.899
No. That's the first thing
I said.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.407
The first thing
I thought to say was,

01:48.469 --> 01:51.070
"dead or alive,
Derek is a dick."

01:51.138 --> 01:52.638
A dick that convinced
Folsom Foods

01:52.706 --> 01:54.874
to settle with us
for $10 million.

01:54.942 --> 01:56.108
Well, we'll just have
to tell his replacement

01:56.176 --> 01:57.710
the settlement needs
a signature.

01:57.778 --> 02:01.347
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why? Who's replacing him?

02:05.652 --> 02:07.620
I'm gonna have
the cornish hen,

02:07.688 --> 02:09.388
and we're gonna start
with the foie gras special,

02:09.455 --> 02:10.523
two of them.

02:10.591 --> 02:11.891
You're gonna love it.
Just one.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.826
I'm okay. Thank you.
Dad.

02:13.894 --> 02:15.528
I'm watching
what I eat.

02:15.596 --> 02:17.530
On my birthday?

02:17.598 --> 02:19.232
I'm trying to be
disciplined.

02:19.299 --> 02:21.200
Listen...

02:21.268 --> 02:24.337
I'm taking a case
against Pearson Hardman.

02:24.404 --> 02:26.072
It's Folsom Foods.
Do you know it?

02:26.139 --> 02:28.541
Um, of course. It's
the gender-discrimination case.

02:28.609 --> 02:30.443
Well, I wanted to give
a chance to get off it,

02:30.511 --> 02:33.012
if you were on it.
Well, I'm not, but okay.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.013
It's just that I know

02:34.081 --> 02:37.517
you keep a low profile
at work.

02:37.584 --> 02:39.619
That was supposed to be
between me and mom.

02:39.686 --> 02:42.421
Well, I wish you could tell me
these things,

02:42.489 --> 02:45.291
and I wish
that you didn't keep the fact

02:45.359 --> 02:46.893
that I was your father
a secret.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.196
It's not a secret.
I just don't broadcast it.

02:50.264 --> 02:53.165
People treat me differently once
they find out you're my dad.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.067
Are you worried
that they're judging you

02:55.135 --> 02:57.203
for being a paralegal?

02:57.271 --> 02:59.272
No, Dad.

02:59.339 --> 03:02.041
Only you judge me
for being a paralegal.

03:02.109 --> 03:04.610
- I do not judge you.
- It doesn't matter.

03:04.678 --> 03:06.779
I'm not planning on being
a paralegal forever.

03:06.847 --> 03:09.649
I know.

03:12.085 --> 03:13.686
Right there.

03:13.754 --> 03:15.087
You can't even pretend
to believe

03:15.155 --> 03:16.923
I have what it takes
to be a lawyer.

03:16.990 --> 03:20.126
Rachel,
you are a beautiful woman,

03:20.193 --> 03:21.527
and you can do whatever
you want.

03:21.595 --> 03:22.929
Beautiful, not smart.

03:22.996 --> 03:24.636
Honey, I am trying
to give you a heads-up.

03:24.665 --> 03:26.532
And you're taking
the whole thing

03:26.600 --> 03:28.701
as an indictment.

03:28.769 --> 03:32.104
Do you believe I have
what it takes to be a lawyer?

03:33.840 --> 03:36.876
It's been five years,

03:36.944 --> 03:38.544
and...

03:38.612 --> 03:40.379
It hasn't happened.

03:40.447 --> 03:42.014
I just wonder
if you've considered

03:42.082 --> 03:43.549
trying something else.

03:43.617 --> 03:44.884
Of all days--

03:44.952 --> 03:46.886
"Hey, Rachel,
how was your birthday?"

03:46.954 --> 03:49.855
"Great. My dad told me
that I should aim lower."

03:49.923 --> 03:52.325
Please, Rachel,
that is not what I meant.

03:52.392 --> 03:54.827
Let's just have lunch.
No, Dad.

03:54.895 --> 03:56.375
Really, I wouldn't want you
to overeat

03:56.396 --> 03:58.197
on the day that you told me
that I won't amount to anything.

03:58.265 --> 04:00.299
Rachel.

04:03.203 --> 04:04.303
Hi.

04:04.371 --> 04:06.839
Excuse me.

04:06.907 --> 04:10.343
But I think you might be
in the wrong office.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.311
Oh, I'm in the right office.

04:12.379 --> 04:16.548
You're Katrina Bennett,
Harvey's mysterious new hire.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.483
I'm afraid that puts me
at a disadvantage,

04:18.552 --> 04:20.252
because I don't know
who you are.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.488
That's our problem
right there.

04:22.556 --> 04:24.156
- We have a problem?
- Oh, yeah, a big one.

04:24.224 --> 04:25.591
You haven't come
to see me yet.

04:25.659 --> 04:26.959
Again, I don't know
who you--

04:27.027 --> 04:29.028
I oversee the first-
and second-year associates.

04:29.096 --> 04:30.796
It's a responsibility
that I take as seriously

04:30.864 --> 04:33.633
as holding the nuclear
launch codes in my hands.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.021
Well, if you take it
so seriously,

04:35.068 --> 04:36.736
then why are you in
a fifth-year associate's office,

04:36.803 --> 04:38.371
trimming your fingernails
at her desk?

04:38.438 --> 04:39.839
Trimming?

04:39.906 --> 04:42.541
This is a gold-plated
nickel alloy cuticle sculptor

04:42.609 --> 04:43.542
from the south of Denmark,

04:43.610 --> 04:45.211
and I will sculpt
my nails

04:45.278 --> 04:46.612
wherever I damn well please.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.682
Why don't we see
what you're up to?

04:49.750 --> 04:50.790
That's password-protected.

04:50.851 --> 04:54.020
Please. Prosecutor99--
third try.

04:54.087 --> 04:56.055
That's a violation
of my privacy.

04:56.123 --> 04:59.558
Oh, yeah?
Who are you gonna tell?

05:01.094 --> 05:03.029
I see you're representing
Chad Ritter.

05:03.096 --> 05:06.766
And this is your defense?
Wow, it's like you're a baboon.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.035
I'm in full control of
Mr. Ritter's defense strategy.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.536
It's not a strategy,
it's a prayer,

05:10.604 --> 05:12.538
which is why I'm going
to be forced to supervise you.

05:12.606 --> 05:14.040
I don't need
a babysitter.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.474
You're not getting
a babysitter.

05:15.542 --> 05:18.244
You're getting Louis Litt.
This is unacceptable.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.313
Be that as it may,

05:21.381 --> 05:24.550
you can either welcome
my tutelage,

05:24.618 --> 05:27.019
or you can crawl back
to the D.A.'s office

05:27.087 --> 05:29.555
from whence you came.

05:32.192 --> 05:34.827
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

05:43.937 --> 05:46.105
You got a minute?

05:46.173 --> 05:47.540
Maybe.

05:47.607 --> 05:49.175
It's not about us.
It's about work.

05:49.242 --> 05:50.242
Oh.
Then, yeah.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.444
Folsom Foods--

05:51.511 --> 05:53.245
Missy Dietler's
your paralegal on it, right?

05:53.313 --> 05:54.847
Yeah, when she's not texting
her boyfriend

05:54.915 --> 05:56.348
every five seconds
or her roommate,

05:56.416 --> 05:57.950
like,
every other five seconds.

05:58.018 --> 05:59.351
Put me on instead.

05:59.419 --> 06:00.519
No.

06:00.587 --> 06:02.288
I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:02.355 --> 06:04.056
The new opposing counsel
is my dad.

06:04.124 --> 06:07.326
Your dad
is Robert Zane?

06:07.394 --> 06:10.229
Is it so hard to believe
that my father's black?

06:10.297 --> 06:11.764
Robert Zane is black?

06:11.832 --> 06:13.299
You think
this is a year-round tan?

06:13.366 --> 06:14.886
I know who you are,
but I can't believe

06:14.901 --> 06:16.869
that your father is
<i>the</i> Robert Zane

06:16.937 --> 06:18.070
and you never said
anything to me.

06:18.138 --> 06:19.705
I don't like people
here knowing.

06:19.773 --> 06:21.507
Oh, and I'm just "people"?

06:23.143 --> 06:25.478
I mean, before,
with the--okay.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.279
Look, I'm offering
to help you kick his ass.

06:27.347 --> 06:29.548
Are you gonna make room
for me or not?

06:32.052 --> 06:34.153
Before I answer
that question,

06:34.221 --> 06:35.755
do you really think
it's a good idea

06:35.822 --> 06:37.256
for you and I
to work together?

06:37.324 --> 06:41.627
Are you really asking me
what is or isn't a good idea?

06:41.695 --> 06:42.728
Wow.

06:42.796 --> 06:46.132

First of ala Robert, I'm sorry
to hear about Derek Portis.

07:19.343 --> 07:21.997
Oh, I appreciate
your condolences, Harvey,

07:22.097 --> 07:24.498
but the fact is,
Derek was a dick.

07:24.566 --> 07:26.367
That's what I said.

07:26.435 --> 07:28.169
That's what everybody says.

07:28.236 --> 07:30.337
In any case, you didn't need
to come all the way over here.

07:30.405 --> 07:31.885
We could've faxed you
that settlement.

07:31.907 --> 07:33.274
Here you go, sir.

07:33.341 --> 07:35.976
You and I both know
I didn't come over here to sign.

07:36.044 --> 07:37.378
I came to negotiate.

07:37.446 --> 07:40.347
To renegotiate,
which is bad faith.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.116
The fact is
you snookered Derek.

07:42.184 --> 07:44.585
10 million is double
what any competent attorney

07:44.653 --> 07:45.853
would've settled for.

07:45.921 --> 07:47.321
Should have been 5.
I'll give you 2.

07:47.389 --> 07:49.423
Great.
Let's settle for 2.

07:49.491 --> 07:51.459
Then I'll get you the keys
to my condo,

07:51.526 --> 07:53.561
and maybe you'll drop a deuce
on my pillow.

07:53.628 --> 07:56.230
Does it have
a security code? Doorman?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.301
Okay,
you've had your fun.

08:00.368 --> 08:01.969
But we're not taking
that offer.

08:02.037 --> 08:04.238
Then when would you like
to schedule

08:04.306 --> 08:05.740
Sloane Moseley's
deposition?

08:05.807 --> 08:08.275
But you can't re-depose her,
Mr. Zane.

08:08.343 --> 08:09.376
Yes, he can.

08:09.444 --> 08:11.312
And you'll use
this opportunity

08:11.379 --> 08:13.814
to show Sloane Moseley
what she's in for.

08:13.882 --> 08:16.016
When I get done with her,

08:16.084 --> 08:18.252
she's gonna jump
at the 2 million.

08:20.055 --> 08:23.224
That's more than bad faith.
That's just cruel.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.992
My offer stands.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.661
Uh, it was nice
to meet you, sir.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.100
What?

08:33.168 --> 08:34.902
"Sir"?
"Mr. Zane"?

08:34.970 --> 08:37.837
Why don't you just call him
"dad" and get it over with?

08:37.905 --> 08:40.073
I was showing respect.

08:40.142 --> 08:41.876
You're trying to get invited
to Thanksgiving dinner.

08:41.943 --> 08:43.611
You think he'd let me have
one of the turkey legs?

08:43.678 --> 08:45.179
I don't think that's what
you're wanting him

08:45.247 --> 08:46.347
to let you have.

08:46.414 --> 08:48.516
You think I didn't notice
that Rachel Zane

08:48.583 --> 08:49.950
just became the paralegal?

08:50.018 --> 08:51.152
She asked to be on it.

08:51.219 --> 08:53.187
This better not end up
with you in bed with her

08:53.255 --> 08:55.122
telling her your secret.
Not a problem.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.423
We'll do it
on the couch.

08:56.491 --> 08:57.625
Wow.

08:57.692 --> 09:00.427
that was not respectful
to you, me, or her.

09:00.495 --> 09:03.798
- Or her father.
- Or your couch.

09:03.865 --> 09:05.666
Not my couch.

09:10.572 --> 09:12.406
- Donna.
- Katrina.

09:12.474 --> 09:15.442
- You know who I am?
- I know who everybody is.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.344
That's what I've heard.
Do you have a minute?

09:17.412 --> 09:18.646
Well, eight days from now,

09:18.713 --> 09:20.915
I think I got
a spare 45 seconds.

09:20.982 --> 09:24.552
Well, if you get
a break...

09:24.619 --> 09:26.987
You think I can be bought
with cookies?

09:27.055 --> 09:28.823
Homemade,
chocolate chip.

09:28.890 --> 09:30.991
- Dark chocolate?
- Semisweet.

09:31.059 --> 09:35.095
- A dollop of peanut butter?
- Butterscotch.

09:35.163 --> 09:37.231
- Walnuts?
- Please.

09:37.299 --> 09:39.834
Pistachios.

09:39.901 --> 09:43.470
The nut of royalty.

09:43.538 --> 09:45.306
Who told you
my weak spot--Mike?

09:45.373 --> 09:46.841
Bertha.

09:46.908 --> 09:48.475
Big Bertha
from the D.A.'s office?

09:48.543 --> 09:50.010
You're remembered
fondly there.

09:50.078 --> 09:51.111
Aw, yeah.

09:51.179 --> 09:54.181
I'm remembered fondly
everywhere.

09:59.387 --> 10:02.189
Okay, you got one minute.

10:02.257 --> 10:04.058
Who the hell
is Louis Litt?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.126
This might take
more than a minute.

10:06.194 --> 10:07.528
How bad?

10:07.596 --> 10:10.431
I'd like to throw him
through a plateglass window.

10:10.498 --> 10:12.032
Not a totally
unprecedented reaction.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.220
Harvey brought me in,
so I don't want to piss him off.

10:14.269 --> 10:15.669
I just want to know
what the protocol is.

10:15.737 --> 10:17.817
Harvey won't stand in
your way, but you listen to me.

10:17.839 --> 10:19.773
You want to go toe-to-toe
with Louis,

10:19.841 --> 10:22.843
you better be prepared
to go the distance.

10:22.911 --> 10:25.045
- Jessica.
- Robert.

10:25.113 --> 10:27.381
What can I do for you?

10:27.449 --> 10:30.784
I just want to talk,
one name partner to another.

10:35.557 --> 10:38.525
I want you to settle
Folsom Foods.

10:38.593 --> 10:41.428
I thought we were
already settling Folsom Foods.

10:41.496 --> 10:43.297
I proposed
a slightly different number.

10:43.365 --> 10:45.566
Which Harvey already
said no to.

10:45.634 --> 10:46.901
Well, you know me.

10:46.968 --> 10:49.336
I don't go for that
gender-discrimination stuff,

10:49.404 --> 10:50.971
but Harvey negotiates
like a girl.

10:51.039 --> 10:52.873
No, he doesn't.

10:52.941 --> 10:54.742
But he does style his hair
like one.

10:54.809 --> 10:56.310
I know.

10:56.378 --> 10:58.512
What the hell is that?

10:58.580 --> 11:01.548
I don't know.
What's your number?

11:01.616 --> 11:03.083
2 million.

11:03.151 --> 11:05.185
That's
an $8 million hit.

11:05.253 --> 11:07.922
It's 8 million to your client,
and you need a win.

11:07.989 --> 11:09.323
Do I?

11:09.391 --> 11:12.526
Yeah, it's no secret
that Pearson Hardman's

11:12.594 --> 11:14.862
been taking it on the chin
since Daniel left.

11:14.930 --> 11:17.865
Well, that might mean
something if I had a glass jaw.

11:17.933 --> 11:21.101
Partners have jumped ship,
associates were poached,

11:21.169 --> 11:22.536
clients have bailed.

11:22.604 --> 11:23.871
Partners were pushed,

11:23.939 --> 11:26.674
associates were fired,
and clients were retained.

11:26.741 --> 11:29.310
Well, you can spin it
all you want.

11:29.377 --> 11:32.413
But a high-profile win--
that sure would look good.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.781
If I lower my price.

11:33.848 --> 11:36.750
A win's a win.
It doesn't matter how ugly.

11:44.592 --> 11:46.694
Robert Zane poked his nose
into my office.

11:46.761 --> 11:49.396
He try and hit on you?
I think he's always had a thing.

11:49.464 --> 11:50.464
Who doesn't?

11:50.532 --> 11:52.599
He thinks we're weak.
I know.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.801
He pulled the settlement.

11:53.868 --> 11:56.136
Not on the case--us.

11:56.204 --> 11:57.471
Are you saying
he went over my head?

11:57.539 --> 11:59.673
He heard about Allison Holt's
bullshit last week.

11:59.741 --> 12:00.908
Let me guess.

12:00.976 --> 12:02.409
He's pulling the same bullshit
right now.

12:02.477 --> 12:04.278
Told me the world knows
we need a win,

12:04.346 --> 12:06.113
tried to leverage that
to get me to settle.

12:06.181 --> 12:07.481
Son of a bitch.

12:07.549 --> 12:10.551
That's not bad faith.
That's below the belt.

12:10.618 --> 12:12.987
You know what I do to someone
who hits me below the belt.

12:13.054 --> 12:15.055
Cut 'em off at the knees.

12:23.832 --> 12:25.799
Louis.

12:29.637 --> 12:33.741
I just need--

12:33.808 --> 12:37.211
I just--

12:45.754 --> 12:47.021
Yeah.

12:47.088 --> 12:50.157
Looks delicious.
What is that?

12:50.225 --> 12:51.892
It's a spinach
and kale power smoothie.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.660
I'm in the middle
of my quarterly cleanse.

12:53.728 --> 12:55.796
What do you want?

12:55.864 --> 12:57.831
To apologize...

12:57.899 --> 12:59.900
for any misunderstanding
we might have had.

12:59.968 --> 13:01.668
That <i>you</i> might have had.

13:01.736 --> 13:05.706
I had.
And it was huge.

13:05.774 --> 13:08.008
I looked up your record.

13:08.076 --> 13:11.612
You're a white-collar genius.

13:11.679 --> 13:12.880
Go on.

13:12.947 --> 13:16.750
I don't just accept
your tutelage.

13:16.818 --> 13:20.521
I'm begging for your help.

13:20.588 --> 13:22.523
Well, beg away.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.358
My motion to dismiss
is Wednesday

13:24.426 --> 13:25.626
with Judge McIntyre.

13:25.693 --> 13:28.195
I've never been able
to connect with him.

13:28.263 --> 13:29.897
Yeah, that's 'cause you
don't understand him.

13:29.964 --> 13:31.598
Well, all I know is
he's punitive.

13:31.666 --> 13:32.766
No, he's a stickler.

13:32.834 --> 13:34.034
Don't be late,
don't be sloppy,

13:34.102 --> 13:35.536
don't be disrespectful,
and he'll love you,

13:35.603 --> 13:38.205
just like he loves me.

13:39.574 --> 13:42.276
Since you know him
so well,

13:42.343 --> 13:44.611
would you do me
the honor of signing on

13:44.679 --> 13:46.046
as first chair?

13:46.114 --> 13:49.450
I can.

13:49.517 --> 13:52.052
And I will.

13:53.721 --> 13:55.355
You've forgiven me
with grace,

13:55.423 --> 13:58.025
and now you're saving me
in my hour of need.

13:58.093 --> 13:59.726
You're my knight
in shining armor.

13:59.794 --> 14:02.996
Ah.

14:03.064 --> 14:05.399
I will see-eth you
on Wednesday, milady.

14:21.649 --> 14:22.950
Um...

14:23.017 --> 14:24.785
You wanted to see me?

14:24.853 --> 14:27.421
Yes,
but usually that means

14:27.489 --> 14:28.889
the person tells Donna
they're here.

14:28.957 --> 14:31.024
Then Donna tells me.
That's how it works.

14:31.092 --> 14:35.996
- Donna's not there.
- You think that's by accident?

14:36.064 --> 14:37.231
Apparently not.

14:37.298 --> 14:39.032
You know why you're here?

14:39.100 --> 14:41.935
Because my last name
is Zane.

14:42.003 --> 14:44.705
You know why Donna isn't?

14:44.772 --> 14:46.974
Because you know
we're friends.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.709
And you're about to ask me
to do something

14:48.776 --> 14:50.644
that she would tell me
not to do.

14:50.712 --> 14:52.679
And what exactly do I want
to ask you?

14:52.747 --> 14:55.482
You want to know if I want
to be in on the deposition.

14:55.550 --> 14:58.152
- You did ask on the case.
- Yes, I did.

14:58.219 --> 15:00.154
And before you ask me
if I'm tough enough

15:00.221 --> 15:01.321
to be in there,

15:01.389 --> 15:02.856
I want you to know
that I am tough enough.

15:02.924 --> 15:04.725
That's not
what I wanted to ask.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.694
I want you to know if you think
it'll rattle your father.

15:07.762 --> 15:09.429
Frankly,
I don't think he'd care.

15:09.497 --> 15:11.231
Good.

15:11.299 --> 15:12.566
Why good?

15:12.634 --> 15:14.635
Because if that's
what you think about him,

15:14.702 --> 15:16.937
then your relationship
is worse than you think,

15:17.005 --> 15:20.274
and he cares about you more
than you know.

15:40.361 --> 15:42.196
Is this a joke?

15:42.263 --> 15:44.131
She doesn't need to be
in there.

15:44.199 --> 15:45.499
Sloane Moseley?

15:45.567 --> 15:47.067
You know
who I'm talking about.

15:47.135 --> 15:48.435
You think having her
in the room

15:48.503 --> 15:50.237
is gonna keep me
from doing my job?

15:50.305 --> 15:51.338
The relevant question is,

15:51.406 --> 15:52.739
what is she gonna think
about you

15:52.807 --> 15:54.641
after you eviscerate
Sloane Moseley?

15:54.709 --> 15:58.579
You accuse me of being cruel,
and you orchestrate this stunt.

15:58.646 --> 16:00.480
We had a deal.
You pulled it.

16:00.548 --> 16:02.216
Put the deal back
on the table,

16:02.283 --> 16:04.718
this whole thing ends now.

16:13.561 --> 16:15.462
Harvey,
what did you do?

16:15.530 --> 16:17.664
My job.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.700
Miss Moseley...

16:23.274 --> 16:25.994
why did you choose
this particular field?

16:27.708 --> 16:30.643
Because I have
a love of food.

16:30.711 --> 16:33.246
Is it really a requirement
of excellence

16:33.313 --> 16:35.214
in an executive
that one love food?

16:35.282 --> 16:36.649
It's not a requirement,

16:36.717 --> 16:37.884
but it's a food company,

16:37.951 --> 16:40.553
and it's what I thought
made it a perfect fit.

16:40.621 --> 16:41.888
Well, if it was such
a perfect fit,

16:41.955 --> 16:44.323
why were you looking
for a job in another field?

16:44.391 --> 16:47.927
Because I spent nine years
killing myself for your client

16:47.995 --> 16:50.196
and got passed over
for promotion after promotion

16:50.264 --> 16:52.498
in favor
of less-qualified men.

16:52.566 --> 16:53.666
Okay, let me get
this straight.

16:53.734 --> 16:55.501
So you hit a wall,
you blame my client,

16:55.569 --> 16:57.003
and rather than figuring out
what it takes

16:57.070 --> 16:58.471
to make it
in this perfect fit,

16:58.539 --> 17:00.673
you give up and fold
like a house of cards.

17:00.741 --> 17:02.041
I don't know what law school
you went to,

17:02.109 --> 17:03.309
but I was always taught

17:03.377 --> 17:05.211
that depositions
require questions.

17:05.279 --> 17:07.680
I went to Harvard.

17:07.748 --> 17:09.115
And here's your question.

17:09.183 --> 17:11.384
After all these interviews
for all these jobs,

17:11.451 --> 17:13.685
why didn't you just pursue
one of them

17:13.753 --> 17:15.555
and switch careers?

17:15.622 --> 17:18.057
It would require
a step backward.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.626
Isn't it true it didn't
require a step backward?

17:20.694 --> 17:21.993
But that's all
you could find,

17:22.061 --> 17:23.362
cause no one thought
you were any good

17:23.430 --> 17:25.364
at the job you had
in the first place.

17:25.432 --> 17:26.531
You don't know that.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.235
I have sworn testimony
from a headhunter

17:29.303 --> 17:31.437
who said
nobody wanted you.

17:31.505 --> 17:32.839
Okay,
you're badgering her.

17:32.906 --> 17:35.274
Well, the truth is
you're untalented and pathetic

17:35.342 --> 17:36.642
and blaming other people

17:36.710 --> 17:38.578
because you don't have
the skills or the fortitude

17:38.645 --> 17:41.214
or anything else to make it
in your chosen field.

17:41.281 --> 17:43.049
And you don't even have
the courage

17:43.116 --> 17:45.117
to try something else.

17:45.185 --> 17:46.452
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure

17:46.520 --> 17:48.454
that the court reporter
got all that.

17:48.522 --> 17:49.856
Did you hear it down there?

17:49.923 --> 17:51.424
We heard it.

17:51.491 --> 17:53.192
Good.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.861
I have a few more questions.

17:54.928 --> 17:56.796
No.

17:56.864 --> 17:59.732
This deposition is over.

18:07.207 --> 18:08.967
This is the men's room.
You know that, right?

18:08.976 --> 18:10.843
Don't do that
shit again.

18:10.911 --> 18:11.944
Excuse me?

18:12.012 --> 18:13.279
I don't need
your protection.

18:13.347 --> 18:14.580
That's what my dad does.

18:14.648 --> 18:16.115
Rachel,
the only thing

18:16.183 --> 18:17.516
your father and I
have in common

18:17.584 --> 18:18.985
is that you're angry
at both of us.

18:19.052 --> 18:20.686
Well, all you did in there
was embarrass me.

18:20.754 --> 18:22.455
Embarrass you?

18:22.522 --> 18:25.458
I wasn't even watching you.
I was watching our client.

18:25.525 --> 18:26.559
You're trying to say

18:26.627 --> 18:28.527
you didn't call that off
because of him?

18:28.595 --> 18:30.296
No, I'm trying to say I didn't
call it off because of you,

18:30.364 --> 18:32.198
even though evidently
you went to Harvey

18:32.266 --> 18:33.799
to ask in
to make it about you.

18:33.867 --> 18:35.534
I didn't go to Harvey.
He came to me.

18:35.602 --> 18:37.770
Look, Rachel, you might want
to make this Zane versus Zane,

18:37.838 --> 18:39.071
but it's not.

18:39.139 --> 18:41.007
It's Folsom Foods
versus our client.

18:41.074 --> 18:42.942
But you're so eager to prove
how tough you are

18:43.010 --> 18:46.078
that you seem
to have forgotten about her.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.518
- How dare you?
- How dare I what?

18:52.586 --> 18:55.154
I just got a $3,000 fine
from Judge McIntyre

18:55.222 --> 18:57.023
for missing my own hearing.

18:57.090 --> 18:58.124
I know.

18:58.191 --> 18:59.892
I was wondering
what happened to you.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.862
I thought maybe your horse
took fever, my liege.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.130
Uhhuh.

19:04.197 --> 19:05.932
You said it was Wednesday,
and you know it.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.566
No.
I said Tuesday...

19:07.634 --> 19:11.037
as is confirmed
in the documents I gave you.

19:12.873 --> 19:15.341
This here is a fight
you don't want to have.

19:15.409 --> 19:18.144
- I didn't pick it.
- Yeah, you did.

19:18.211 --> 19:19.645
And now you're gonna pay
that fine,

19:19.713 --> 19:20.980
and you're gonna write
a letter

19:21.048 --> 19:23.349
expressing how sorry you are
to Judge McIntyre.

19:23.417 --> 19:26.152
No. I'm not.

19:26.219 --> 19:28.421
I'm gonna count to five.

19:28.488 --> 19:30.323
You can count to 500.

19:30.390 --> 19:33.793
The only thing I'm sorry for
is getting stuck with you.

19:33.860 --> 19:36.128
You lied to me...

19:36.196 --> 19:38.197
and you know it.

19:38.265 --> 19:40.066
Oh, yeah?

19:40.133 --> 19:42.735
Who you gonna tell?

19:55.048 --> 19:57.883
Here it comes.
Speech number 162--

19:57.951 --> 19:59.719
14 reasons
why I'm an asshole.

19:59.786 --> 20:01.654
No, no.
This is gonna be 216.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.189
That's uncharted territory.

20:03.256 --> 20:05.024
And you're still
not gonna like it.

20:05.092 --> 20:07.093
If it's coming from you,
that goes without saying.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.521
Look, I'm just saying
that you went

20:08.528 --> 20:10.029
out of your way to put Rachel
in that deposition.

20:10.097 --> 20:11.430
You promised
uncharted territory.

20:11.498 --> 20:12.865
We've been here before.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.834
No, usually you're accusing me
of making things personal.

20:14.901 --> 20:16.702
But this time
you're making things personal

20:16.770 --> 20:17.770
for Robert Zane.

20:17.838 --> 20:19.271
No.
He made it personal.

20:19.339 --> 20:20.840
And how exactly did
he do that?

20:20.907 --> 20:22.675
He threatened our firm.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.378
And on top of that,
he tried to show Sloane Moseley

20:25.445 --> 20:28.114
what she'd be in for her
if this goes to trial.

20:28.181 --> 20:30.182
So I'm just returning
the favor.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.610
Yeah, well, it didn't seem to
have much of an effect on him.

20:32.619 --> 20:33.686
Trust me.
It will.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.187
And did you think
about the effect

20:35.255 --> 20:37.323
it'll have on Sloane Moseley,
not to mention his daughter?

20:37.391 --> 20:38.657
Here we are,

20:38.725 --> 20:41.127
right back to good old 162.

20:41.194 --> 20:43.129
Did you misunderstand me
when I said

20:43.196 --> 20:44.764
to cut Robert Zane
off at the knees?

20:44.831 --> 20:46.032
You too?

20:46.099 --> 20:47.600
Oh, don't tell me
you think I went too far.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.135
I don't think
you went far enough.

20:49.202 --> 20:50.970
- What?
- Your client just called.

20:51.038 --> 20:53.906
She wants to take
Zane's bullshit settlement.

20:57.577 --> 20:59.245
You're gonna want
to turn your hips

20:59.312 --> 21:02.481
to transfer your weight
through the ball.

21:04.351 --> 21:05.484
Nice job tracking me down.

21:05.552 --> 21:06.819
You think
you're the only one

21:06.887 --> 21:08.521
who knows
where Judge Benjamin plays?

21:08.588 --> 21:09.722
No.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.691
But I'm the only one here
he plays with.

21:12.759 --> 21:16.829
Now, did you come here
to caddie for me?

21:16.897 --> 21:18.631
I came here to negotiate.

21:18.698 --> 21:20.833
Bullshit.

21:24.071 --> 21:26.906
Your client caved
after that deposition,

21:26.973 --> 21:29.608
because she knew she couldn't
make it through a trial.

21:29.676 --> 21:31.877
So I'm gonna negotiate
for you.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.979
The offer on the table
was 2 million.

21:34.047 --> 21:36.215
It just went down to one.
Robert.

21:36.283 --> 21:37.850
Now it's 500,000.

21:37.918 --> 21:39.151
You're pretty good
at this.

21:39.219 --> 21:41.053
Remind me to have you buy
my next car for me.

21:41.121 --> 21:42.721
Now it's 100,000.

21:42.789 --> 21:45.624
No, wait.

21:45.692 --> 21:48.160
Here.

21:48.228 --> 21:51.163
No one wins
if we go to war.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.768
You don't have children,
do you?

21:55.836 --> 21:59.305
You came to my house
and threatened my firm.

21:59.372 --> 22:01.140
"Your house"?

22:01.208 --> 22:03.042
You put my little girl
in that deposition

22:03.110 --> 22:05.111
so she could see me
shred that woman,

22:05.178 --> 22:07.146
which I did
because that's my job.

22:07.214 --> 22:09.115
And I was trying to protect
that woman.

22:09.182 --> 22:10.816
That was my job.

22:10.884 --> 22:13.686
Well, your client is scared
shitless.

22:13.753 --> 22:15.287
So I guess that means
that I did my job

22:15.355 --> 22:16.722
a lot better
than you did yours.

22:16.790 --> 22:19.291
The settlement is gone.

22:19.359 --> 22:21.293
You want something...

22:21.361 --> 22:24.663
you come take it at trial.

22:34.283 --> 22:37.226
What do you need?

22:37.326 --> 22:38.359
A napkin.

22:38.427 --> 22:40.028
No
social security number,

22:40.095 --> 22:41.596
date of birth,
favorite color,

22:41.664 --> 22:42.864
allergy to nuts--
I don't know.

22:42.932 --> 22:44.332
What's it gonna take?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.700
I don't think
I need to steal

22:45.768 --> 22:47.235
your father's identity
just yet.

22:47.303 --> 22:49.203
Mike said he pulled
the settlement,

22:49.271 --> 22:51.272
and we can't let that happen.

22:51.340 --> 22:53.975
- "We"?
- Yes, "we."

22:54.043 --> 22:55.877
I work here too.

22:55.945 --> 22:58.413
- Now I get it.
- Get--

22:58.480 --> 23:01.115
No, no, no. This isn't
about me and my father.

23:01.183 --> 23:02.450
This is about the client.

23:02.518 --> 23:05.320
No, I meant
why Donna likes you so much.

23:05.387 --> 23:07.455
Oh.

23:07.523 --> 23:09.090
Thank you.
I-I like her too.

23:09.158 --> 23:10.391
You know what?

23:10.459 --> 23:13.294
I was gonna give in
and drop this case.

23:13.362 --> 23:16.531
But now that you accosted me
during my me time,

23:16.599 --> 23:20.201
I'm gonna change my mind
and do what you say.

23:20.269 --> 23:22.503
You were gonna continue
with it anyway.

23:22.571 --> 23:24.272
- Yes.
- Right.

23:24.340 --> 23:26.841
Would you like to eat
my bagel now too?

23:26.909 --> 23:31.045
Oh, thank you. I...

23:31.113 --> 23:33.848
I'm so sorry.

23:33.916 --> 23:36.551
Thank you.

23:49.198 --> 23:52.367
Hi.

23:52.434 --> 23:54.435
What are you doing here?

23:54.503 --> 23:56.004
I just came by to tell you
that you were right.

23:56.071 --> 23:57.338
This is your case, not mine.

23:57.406 --> 23:59.641
I'm no longer first chair.

23:59.708 --> 24:01.075
Fine.
We're best friends.

24:01.143 --> 24:02.610
Now please leave.

24:02.678 --> 24:06.114
Okay, I came to give you
your files back.

24:06.181 --> 24:07.348
All rise.

24:07.416 --> 24:09.817
No way.
I wasn't born yesterday.

24:09.885 --> 24:11.386
I've got my files
right here.

24:11.453 --> 24:13.855
Okay, Katrina, I'm offering us
both a way out here.

24:13.922 --> 24:17.325
You keep whatever's in those
files the hell away from me.

24:17.393 --> 24:19.460
Okay.
You got me.

24:19.528 --> 24:22.463
I'm not to be trusted.
All right, let's get to it.

24:22.531 --> 24:24.451
Ms. Bennett, I believe
you have something for me.

24:24.466 --> 24:26.167
Your Honor,

24:26.235 --> 24:28.236
Mr. Gibbs charged my client
with securities fraud,

24:28.303 --> 24:30.238
but he neglected
to disclose discrepancies

24:30.305 --> 24:32.974
between the S.E.C.'S findings
and the IRS's.

24:33.042 --> 24:37.612
I have with me an exhibit.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.180
I'm sorry.

24:39.248 --> 24:41.015
You must've accidentally
somehow gotten

24:41.083 --> 24:42.216
the file of pictures of me

24:42.284 --> 24:45.720
photoshopped
as various American presidents.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.522
I actually like that one.

24:47.589 --> 24:48.756
I look pretty sharp,
don't I?

24:48.824 --> 24:50.591
What you're really looking
for was this...

24:50.659 --> 24:52.026
like I offered.

24:52.094 --> 24:54.328
But per your request,

24:54.396 --> 24:56.731
I'm gonna keep it
the hell away from you.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.267
Is this some sort of joke?

24:59.334 --> 25:00.935
No.
Your Honor.

25:01.003 --> 25:03.037
Bring that folder up here
right now.

25:03.105 --> 25:04.939
And if they're not
legitimate court documents,

25:05.007 --> 25:07.341
you are in for one hell
of a fine.

25:07.409 --> 25:10.211
Uh...

25:17.619 --> 25:19.120
What are you working on?

25:19.188 --> 25:21.823
I'm going through the reviews
for every executive

25:21.890 --> 25:24.192
promoted at Folsom Foods
for the last five years.

25:24.259 --> 25:25.960
You?

25:26.028 --> 25:29.263
Reviews of every executive
promoted at Folsom Foods

25:29.331 --> 25:30.932
for the past five years.

25:36.305 --> 25:37.872
You were right.

25:37.940 --> 25:40.174
This is not Zane versus Zane.

25:40.242 --> 25:42.477
And I don't want to talk
about my dad anymore.

25:42.544 --> 25:44.479
Good.

25:44.546 --> 25:46.481
It's like
he was sitting me down

25:46.548 --> 25:48.349
and looking me in the eye

25:48.417 --> 25:52.220
and telling me...
What?

25:52.287 --> 25:54.822
That I'm untalented
and pathetic

25:54.890 --> 25:56.858
and don't have
the skills or the fortitude

25:56.925 --> 25:59.527
or anything else it takes
to make it in my chosen field.

25:59.595 --> 26:01.195
He was talking
to a client.

26:01.263 --> 26:03.564
You got a 172.
You're going to law school.

26:03.632 --> 26:06.200
He can't deny that.

26:06.268 --> 26:09.704
Yeah.
He--he doesn't know that.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.609
Rachel, you--

26:16.612 --> 26:18.713
When I, um...

26:18.781 --> 26:22.550
told him that I was
high-school salutatorian...

26:24.386 --> 26:27.054
Guess what the first words
out of his mouth were.

26:27.122 --> 26:29.524
He wanted to know
who the valedictorian was.

26:29.591 --> 26:30.792
Nope.

26:30.859 --> 26:32.660
He said...

26:32.728 --> 26:34.929
"Number two ain't bad."

26:34.997 --> 26:36.798
He thought
it was funny.

26:41.436 --> 26:44.272
Everyone's always said
that my mom is beautiful

26:44.339 --> 26:49.010
and that my dad is smart
and powerful.

26:51.713 --> 26:54.515
And all I've ever wanted
is for him...

27:05.027 --> 27:07.728
He's never gonna see
a different side of you

27:07.796 --> 27:11.399
if you don't show him
a different side of you.

27:11.466 --> 27:14.569
He knew I was sitting
right there.

27:14.636 --> 27:17.446
You chose to be sitting
right there.

27:28.817 --> 27:30.384
- Louis.
- Hi, Donna.

27:30.452 --> 27:31.385
What can I do for you?

27:31.453 --> 27:32.820
Not for me.

27:32.888 --> 27:34.789
For Katrina.

27:34.857 --> 27:37.558
- Which one's Katrina again?
- Okay, you know what?

27:37.626 --> 27:39.227
You've had your fun.
Time to let it go.

27:39.294 --> 27:40.962
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna let anything go

27:41.029 --> 27:42.697
until that woman kneels
before Zod.

27:42.764 --> 27:44.999
First of all,
you know who Zod is?

27:45.067 --> 27:46.634
And second of all,
you think you're Zod?

27:46.702 --> 27:48.369
General Zod
was a visionary leader

27:48.437 --> 27:50.304
who was underappreciated
by his entire planet.

27:50.372 --> 27:51.772
Of course
I know who he is.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.474
Okay, well,
Katrina isn't Superman,

27:53.542 --> 27:56.777
so what the hell
do you want from her?

27:56.845 --> 28:00.047
Okay.
I get it.

28:00.115 --> 28:01.816
Harvey is Superman,
and he hired Katrina,

28:01.884 --> 28:03.517
instead of you getting
your first-year.

28:03.585 --> 28:05.586
Her name was Maria,
and this is not about that.

28:05.654 --> 28:07.955
What this is about
is me getting respect

28:08.023 --> 28:09.657
from a new employee, so...

28:09.725 --> 28:11.759
You beat her.
You want her respect?

28:11.827 --> 28:13.761
Make up with her
and leave her alone.

28:13.829 --> 28:16.230
Oh, really, Donna?
Is that a sign of respect?

28:16.298 --> 28:17.999
Leaving someone alone,
like you and Harvey

28:18.066 --> 28:19.400
left me alone
since Daniel?

28:19.468 --> 28:21.502
Louis, Harvey
welcomed you back.

28:21.570 --> 28:22.803
"Welcomed"?

28:22.871 --> 28:24.872
He ripped up
my letter of resignation,

28:24.940 --> 28:26.274
and he didn't say a word.

28:26.341 --> 28:27.575
- Louis.
- You know what?

28:27.643 --> 28:29.143
Over the years,
all the ribbing

28:29.211 --> 28:31.445
and all the practical jokes
between you and Harvey--

28:31.513 --> 28:33.681
I found that to be
a sign of respect.

28:33.749 --> 28:36.050
But you haven't had
one conversation with me

28:36.118 --> 28:37.318
since you told me
you never wanted

28:37.386 --> 28:38.486
to see my smug face again.

28:38.553 --> 28:40.554
So you know what?
You go tell Katrina

28:40.622 --> 28:43.024
that I'm not really
in a forgiving mood.

28:56.972 --> 28:58.839
I had an idea
about Folsom Foods.

28:58.907 --> 29:00.741
- You too?
- What?

29:00.809 --> 29:02.276
You are not getting
my bagel.

29:02.344 --> 29:03.811
Why would I want
your bagel?

29:03.879 --> 29:05.546
Never mind.
What do you got?

29:05.614 --> 29:06.881
I checked the review
of every promotion

29:06.949 --> 29:08.049
from the last five years.

29:08.116 --> 29:09.817
Every time
they don't promote a woman,

29:09.885 --> 29:12.653
they use some combination
of the same 16 words.

29:12.721 --> 29:14.855
- And the men?
- No.

29:14.923 --> 29:16.157
What are the words?

29:16.224 --> 29:18.993
"High-strung, sensitive,
aggressive, abrasive..."

29:19.061 --> 29:20.561
Coded language.

29:20.629 --> 29:22.296
They went out of their way
to shield themselves

29:22.364 --> 29:24.665
from any one person bringing
a gender-discrimination suit,

29:24.733 --> 29:26.567
which means they treated
all of them the same.

29:26.635 --> 29:27.568
As a class.

29:27.636 --> 29:30.237
Yeah.
And guess how many.

29:30.305 --> 29:33.841
113 female employees
across all 22 divisions--

29:33.909 --> 29:35.409
you know
what they have in common?

29:35.477 --> 29:36.677
All denied promotions

29:36.745 --> 29:38.212
due to the fact
that they're women,

29:38.280 --> 29:40.514
not that they're untalented
or pathetic

29:40.582 --> 29:44.552
or lack the fortitude
to excel in their chosen field.

29:44.619 --> 29:45.920
This is a crock of shit.

29:45.988 --> 29:47.788
You didn't want to settle
for 2 million.

29:47.856 --> 29:49.957
You'll be lucky to settle
for 200 million.

29:50.025 --> 29:51.592
Robert,
play all the golf you want.

29:51.660 --> 29:54.862
Judge Benjamin isn't gonna
get you out of this one.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.595
How we doing today, boys?

30:16.831 --> 30:18.899
Sir, need you to step
over here, please.

30:18.966 --> 30:20.801
Easy, Batman.
I left my belt on.

30:20.868 --> 30:22.702
Well, if it's okay
with you,

30:22.770 --> 30:26.339
I'm gonna break out
my trusty bat metal detector.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.287
Sir, we need you to raise

30:28.342 --> 30:29.709
your arms
above your head, please.

30:29.777 --> 30:32.145
Okay, and I'm gonna need
your badge number.

30:32.213 --> 30:33.280
How did those get there?

30:33.347 --> 30:35.916
- Sir, this is a weapon.
- A weapon?

30:35.983 --> 30:37.250
They're my nail scissors,
you asshole.

30:37.318 --> 30:38.718
They're gold-plated.
They cost $2,000.

30:38.786 --> 30:40.821
You're gonna bring a $2,000
weapon into my courthouse?

30:40.888 --> 30:42.556
I'm just saying I don't know
even how they got there.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.957
Oh, well, maybe the Riddler
put them there.

30:44.025 --> 30:45.425
Okay, that's very funny.
I'm just saying--

30:45.493 --> 30:46.693
maybe it was, like,
a big misunderstanding.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.928
You say you don't know
whose those are?

30:47.995 --> 30:49.930
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay. I'm sorry.

30:49.997 --> 30:51.264
Okay, let's just start over.

30:51.332 --> 30:52.499
I'm just gonna need
them back.

30:52.567 --> 30:53.967
Ow!

30:54.035 --> 30:55.535
I'm placing you
under arrest

30:55.603 --> 30:56.803
for carrying
a concealed weapon

30:56.804 --> 30:58.071
into a courthouse
in the state of New York

30:58.139 --> 30:59.539
and for assaulting
an officer of the court.

30:59.607 --> 31:00.807
- What?
- Hey, Eddie.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.709
Hey, Ms. Bennett.
Nice to see you again.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.244
- How are Shelly and the kids?
- Oh, they're doing great.

31:04.312 --> 31:05.612
You know, I mean--
you know, she's--

31:05.680 --> 31:07.047
yeah. No, they're doing great.
Thanks for asking.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.115
It was her!

31:08.182 --> 31:10.317
You think
I don't know that?

31:19.427 --> 31:22.162
I always loved
that picture.

31:22.230 --> 31:24.598
Me too.

31:24.665 --> 31:28.602
Tryouts
for the school play.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.337
Minnie Mouse.

31:30.404 --> 31:32.506
I want to talk
about the deposition.

31:32.573 --> 31:36.009
Rachel, you and I cannot talk
about the case.

31:36.077 --> 31:38.111
I said the deposition,
not the case.

31:38.179 --> 31:39.779
I don't give a shit
about the case.

31:39.847 --> 31:41.515
Then why did you take it?

31:41.582 --> 31:43.016
Because you took me out
for my birthday

31:43.084 --> 31:45.485
and told me you were picking
a fight with my family and said,

31:45.553 --> 31:48.855
"Sit it out, little girl.
You can't handle this."

31:51.692 --> 31:55.962
Do you know
why I love that picture?

31:56.030 --> 31:58.098
Because I'm still
your little girl.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.033
Because you were happy.

32:04.505 --> 32:07.073
You remember what happened
at those tryouts?

32:07.141 --> 32:09.075
Yeah.
I didn't get the part.

32:09.143 --> 32:12.312
- And it killed you.
- I was a child.

32:12.380 --> 32:16.249
And most children
let things go.

32:16.317 --> 32:18.618
But you never tried out
for a play again.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.620
I did other things.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.490
But why aren't you doing
other things now?

32:23.558 --> 32:27.194
I am watching you fail

32:27.261 --> 32:30.664
and stall
and beat yourself up.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.501
And it rips me up inside.

32:36.170 --> 32:39.105
I took the LSATs.

32:39.173 --> 32:42.609
I got a 172.

32:42.677 --> 32:43.944
When?

32:44.011 --> 32:46.146
Six weeks ago.

32:48.783 --> 32:50.617
And you're just
telling me now.

32:50.685 --> 32:54.921
I didn't want to hear
some joke about your 177.

32:54.989 --> 32:56.790
- Ah, but--
- When we were in that room,

32:56.857 --> 32:58.124
I know you were talking
to her,

32:58.192 --> 33:01.628
but it was like you were aiming
everything right at me.

33:01.696 --> 33:03.129
And then I thought,
"you know what?

33:03.197 --> 33:05.031
Maybe you look
at all of us that way."

33:05.099 --> 33:08.101
- Rachel.
- Well, we're not all the same.

33:08.169 --> 33:09.703
And you need to toughen up

33:09.770 --> 33:13.673
because I am not
that little girl anymore.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.715
So who's gonna kneel
before Zod now?

33:21.782 --> 33:23.316
I'm not kneeling
before anybody,

33:23.384 --> 33:24.718
let alone the person
who framed me

33:24.785 --> 33:26.019
and put me
in this jail cell.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.921
You humiliated me
with Judge McIntyre.

33:27.989 --> 33:29.656
Oh, please.
You did the same thing.

33:29.724 --> 33:31.191
Missing an appearance
is different

33:31.259 --> 33:33.026
from looking
like a buffoon in open court.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.695
I gave you a way out,
so don't come crying to me.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.431
Rapist, murderer...

33:38.499 --> 33:42.002
these are the kinds of people
I'm used to dealing with.

33:42.069 --> 33:43.603
And you know
where they are?

33:43.671 --> 33:45.405
Spending the rest
of their lives

33:45.473 --> 33:49.109
realizing that I wasn't just
a pretty face.

33:49.176 --> 33:51.077
Is that what you think
this is about?

33:51.145 --> 33:53.880
You treated me like shit
because I'm a woman.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.116
How dare you?
I worship women.

33:56.183 --> 33:59.119
My mother, my grandmother--
God rest her soul--

33:59.186 --> 34:02.756
Hillary Clinton,
Gwen Stefani.

34:02.823 --> 34:06.693
Then what the hell
is your problem?

34:06.761 --> 34:10.697
You took a job from somebody
who deserved it more.

34:12.433 --> 34:16.770
I went to resubmit my motion
to dismiss.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.873
Turns out judge McIntyre
already received it...

34:19.940 --> 34:21.541
from me.

34:21.609 --> 34:24.210
The client needed it,
and you wrote it.

34:24.277 --> 34:26.713
For me to put my signature
on it would just be wrong.

34:26.781 --> 34:29.815
Well, it worked.

34:29.884 --> 34:33.386
Are you ready to call
a truce?

34:33.454 --> 34:35.789
Are you gonna frame me
for murder if I say no?

34:35.856 --> 34:38.891
Not as long
as you keep these

34:38.958 --> 34:40.260
in your own office.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.234
Robert.

34:48.302 --> 34:50.070
What a coincidence seeing
you here.

34:50.137 --> 34:52.572
- It's not a coincidence.
- I didn't think it was.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.507
I got to give it
to your man Harvey.

34:54.574 --> 34:55.875
He comes full throttle.

34:55.943 --> 34:57.877
He has his pros and cons.

34:57.945 --> 34:59.813
They all do.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.481
Did you bring
your checkbook?

35:01.549 --> 35:04.217
Thank you.
I brought this.

35:07.455 --> 35:09.856
You're going to decertify
our class?

35:09.924 --> 35:11.624
I'm gonna bust it
wide open.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.973
You see, after you brought
my daughter to that deposition,

35:13.994 --> 35:16.429
I realized not
all women are the same.

35:16.497 --> 35:19.733
No way this gets
busted up into 113 cases.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.901
I'd say a minimum of 45.

35:21.969 --> 35:24.003
Some you may win,
some you may lose,

35:24.071 --> 35:26.606
all of which are gonna drain
your resources.

35:26.674 --> 35:28.575
You're threatening me again.

35:28.642 --> 35:31.711
- I have another option.
- Which is what?

35:31.779 --> 35:35.749
I told you--
not all women are the same.

35:35.816 --> 35:39.052
You got to be kidding me.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.921
"Not all women are the same."
What the hell does that mean?

35:41.989 --> 35:43.690
He wants to merge.

35:43.758 --> 35:44.758
What?

35:44.825 --> 35:46.459
Pearson Zane.

35:46.527 --> 35:48.862
No. No way.
I'm not doing that.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.096
Oh, excuse me?

35:50.164 --> 35:51.844
We didn't fight off Hardman
to end up here.

35:51.866 --> 35:53.427
Well, you went
after the man's daughter,

35:53.434 --> 35:54.734
which is what put us here.

35:54.802 --> 35:56.369
You told me to cut him off
at the knees.

35:56.437 --> 35:58.438
If you're gonna go that low
to put someone down,

35:58.506 --> 36:02.041
then you better make damn sure
that they don't get back up.

36:02.109 --> 36:03.777
It doesn't matter
if it's Robert or not.

36:03.844 --> 36:05.378
They're gonna keep coming.

36:05.446 --> 36:06.767
Until I put your name
on the door.

36:06.781 --> 36:09.516
That's not
what this is about.

36:09.583 --> 36:12.652
We can only take these hits
for so long.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.655
Death by a thousand cuts.

36:18.659 --> 36:20.059
All right.

36:20.127 --> 36:21.995
Well, if they're
gonna keep coming,

36:22.062 --> 36:26.666
then we may as well
just make it one big brawl.

36:41.276 --> 36:44.545
Jessica.
What a coincidence.

36:44.613 --> 36:46.381
Skip it.

36:46.448 --> 36:48.616
I'm guessing
by your tone

36:48.684 --> 36:50.218
that our merger
is off the table?

36:50.285 --> 36:52.120
It was never on the table.

36:52.187 --> 36:53.588
- What's this?
- A press release.

36:53.656 --> 36:56.190
"Female head
of major law firm

36:56.258 --> 36:57.579
"is going to the ends
of the earth

36:57.626 --> 37:00.528
to fight 45 cases
of gender discrimination."

37:00.596 --> 37:01.996
This is bullshit.

37:02.064 --> 37:05.266
Look at me.

37:05.334 --> 37:07.035
You'll cripple your firm.

37:07.102 --> 37:09.470
I would rather lose my firm

37:09.538 --> 37:13.041
than get married staring down
the barrel of a shotgun.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.942
You're not gonna be able
to have my daughter

37:15.010 --> 37:16.010
in every deposition.

37:16.078 --> 37:17.512
This is 45 cases.

37:17.579 --> 37:20.014
And it will cost you
45 times the amount

37:20.082 --> 37:22.784
that you could settle
for right here.

37:25.754 --> 37:28.289
Yeah, I know you.

37:28.357 --> 37:33.261
The chess master--
you think you're Bobby Fischer.

37:33.328 --> 37:36.898
This isn't chess.
It's dominoes.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.367
Now, the first case
might be tough.

37:39.435 --> 37:41.169
But after that,

37:41.236 --> 37:44.205
one by one...

37:44.273 --> 37:45.973
And when it's all said
and done,

37:46.041 --> 37:47.642
I'll be
the last one standing,

37:47.710 --> 37:50.945
holding a big, fat check
in my hand.

38:03.726 --> 38:06.961
Remind me
to get the papers ready

38:07.029 --> 38:11.866
for, uh, the deposition
tomorrow, the 19th.

38:11.934 --> 38:13.868
Uh, that would--

38:15.904 --> 38:18.806
holy shit.

38:18.874 --> 38:21.743
Who the hell did this?

38:21.810 --> 38:24.412
All right, Norma, if you're
gonna keep letting people

38:24.480 --> 38:26.280
into this office like this,

38:26.348 --> 38:29.016
then what the hell
good are you?

38:29.084 --> 38:30.418
Oh, yeah, wait.

38:30.486 --> 38:33.387
And by the way, remind me
to buy socks for next week.

38:33.455 --> 38:35.823
I'm running low.

38:43.232 --> 38:44.999
I got to admit,

38:45.067 --> 38:48.369
you do look
kind of hot as a bad boy.

38:48.437 --> 38:51.139
You tell me right now
this was not Katrina Bennett,

38:51.206 --> 38:52.573
'cause this is not a truce.
Oh, please.

38:52.641 --> 38:54.876
Katrina had nothing to do
with this.

38:54.943 --> 38:56.677
- Then this was you?
- No.

38:56.745 --> 38:58.713
Harvey?

39:00.182 --> 39:02.083
You're not lying.

39:02.151 --> 39:03.417
Nope.

39:03.485 --> 39:05.286
Does this mean
that you and I are good?

39:05.354 --> 39:07.021
No.

39:07.089 --> 39:09.056
Not yet.

39:09.124 --> 39:10.858
Bye, Louis.

39:10.926 --> 39:13.294
Wait, don't go.

39:14.997 --> 39:16.664
We're back!

39:16.732 --> 39:19.700
No, we're not.

39:19.768 --> 39:21.969
Oh, shit.

39:25.941 --> 39:28.676
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:32.648 --> 39:34.348
I'm dropping the case.

39:37.386 --> 39:39.620
Why?

39:39.688 --> 39:42.223
Because I never should have
taken it in the first place.

39:42.291 --> 39:44.559
- Dad.
- You said it yourself.

39:44.626 --> 39:47.028
I picked a fight
with your family,

39:47.095 --> 39:49.730
told you to sit it out,

39:49.798 --> 39:52.533
and those aren't words a man
should ever hear from--

39:52.601 --> 39:55.236
from his daughter.

39:56.972 --> 39:59.574
You're not tough enough?

39:59.641 --> 40:01.709
Not even close.

40:04.913 --> 40:06.714
Well, we never finished
our lunch.

40:06.782 --> 40:08.649
Tomorrow?

40:08.717 --> 40:11.252
Tomorrow.

40:11.320 --> 40:14.021
But we'll have to pick
a new place.

40:14.089 --> 40:18.659
I already tried
that foie gras of yours.

40:18.727 --> 40:22.163
- You did?
- Yep.

40:22.231 --> 40:23.164
And?

40:23.232 --> 40:26.033
It tasted like ass.

40:26.101 --> 40:28.636
Come on.

40:37.045 --> 40:39.547
Looks like
you guys made up.

40:39.615 --> 40:42.016
It's a start.

40:42.084 --> 40:43.684
I didn't want
to interrupt,

40:43.752 --> 40:45.720
and I know
I'm a few days late,

40:45.787 --> 40:47.722
but...

40:49.791 --> 40:51.759
Is that my--

40:51.827 --> 40:53.728
Your LSAT score?

40:53.795 --> 40:56.564
Yeah.
I figured...

40:56.632 --> 40:59.734
You shouldn't keep things
like this a secret.

40:59.801 --> 41:01.302
Thanks, Mike.

41:01.370 --> 41:03.237
Happy Birthday.

41:03.305 --> 41:06.807
How did you know
it was my birthday?

41:06.875 --> 41:10.645
Oh, right.
I must have told you once.

41:10.712 --> 41:12.513
You did, yeah.
I mean, I forgot.

41:12.581 --> 41:14.949
Yeah, this is from Donna.

41:15.017 --> 41:17.184
Come on.

41:17.252 --> 41:18.552
That is exac--

41:18.620 --> 41:20.321
I just saw that.

41:20.389 --> 41:21.555
Yeah, that's how fast I am.

41:21.623 --> 41:24.859
You're impressed.
It's no big deal.

41:29.264 --> 41:30.665
How did it go down?

41:30.732 --> 41:32.700
Did you tell him if he puts
one of ours in the hospital,

41:32.768 --> 41:34.468
we put one
of his in the morgue?

41:34.536 --> 41:37.104
No, Harvey. I did not quote
<i>The Untouchables</i> to the man.

41:37.172 --> 41:40.207
You should've,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

41:40.275 --> 41:41.609
That's really funny,

41:41.677 --> 41:44.779
you lying member
of a no-good--

41:44.846 --> 41:46.380
Robert.

41:46.448 --> 41:48.649
Oh, I hate to interrupt
in the middle

41:48.717 --> 41:50.184
of a <i>Untouchables</i>
<i>quote fest.</i>

41:50.252 --> 41:52.186
Two doors down,
they're doing <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

41:52.254 --> 41:53.754
You'd fit right in.

41:53.822 --> 41:55.756
I'm more
of a <i>Beaches</i> man myself.

41:55.824 --> 41:57.591
I assume you're here
to settle.

41:57.659 --> 41:58.926
I'm afraid not.

41:58.994 --> 42:01.228
I wanted to tell you
that my firm

42:01.296 --> 42:02.964
has a conflict of interest,

42:03.031 --> 42:05.199
so I decided to farm out
the case.

42:05.267 --> 42:07.668
Whose ass
are we gonna kick now?

42:07.736 --> 42:10.638
Actually,
an old classmate of mine.

42:10.706 --> 42:13.174
Let me guess...

42:13.241 --> 42:16.010
Daniel Hardman.
