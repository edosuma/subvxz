00:17.483 --> 00:21.253
Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement,

00:21.254 --> 00:24.039
there occurred a game-changing emergency.

00:24.089 --> 00:25.524
Van Smoot is available.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.803
Oh, my God!

00:26.804 --> 00:30.358
Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River.

00:30.359 --> 00:32.886
It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding,

00:32.887 --> 00:34.390
but it was never available.

00:34.391 --> 00:36.885
And then, suddenly, it was.

00:36.886 --> 00:39.140
There was a cancellation two months from now.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.510
You want to have our wedding in two months?

00:41.510 --> 00:43.080
No. It's impossible.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.833
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!

00:45.833 --> 00:49.003
No, there's just not enough time. There's no way...

00:49.003 --> 00:51.176
Oh! Mini-vomit.

00:51.353 --> 00:53.811
Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it.

00:53.811 --> 00:57.170
If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.

00:57.170 --> 00:58.866
Todd and Valerie?

01:00.913 --> 01:03.988
When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste

01:03.990 --> 01:06.042
that seems to be one step ahead of you.

01:06.042 --> 01:08.317
Todd and Valerie were that couple.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.900
We got to make a decision.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.995
Todd and Valerie are in motion.

01:14.853 --> 01:16.302
Van Smoot!

01:16.302 --> 01:18.617
Oh! Kids, color!

01:22.720 --> 01:25.225
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:38.661 --> 01:40.217
Hello, Marshall.

01:40.903 --> 01:42.205
Lily.

01:42.372 --> 01:43.737
Todd.

01:44.281 --> 01:45.747
Valerie.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.155
Stairs.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.150
I can't believe it.

01:53.150 --> 01:55.462
We got Van Smoot House.

01:55.462 --> 01:58.110
It is on. It is on!

01:58.110 --> 02:00.885
Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

02:01.841 --> 02:02.887
- What?
- You're a wonder.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.052
Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.

02:05.052 --> 02:06.663
How are you going to get everything done?

02:06.663 --> 02:10.191
Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.

02:10.191 --> 02:13.216
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.

02:14.493 --> 02:17.753
Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated

02:17.753 --> 02:20.415
my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.

02:20.421 --> 02:23.108
- Was it...?
- It was your girlfriend.

02:23.553 --> 02:25.357
You might want to call her back.

02:26.053 --> 02:30.042
Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist?

02:30.042 --> 02:35.545
And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.

02:35.551 --> 02:38.717
Wow. That was really awkward, Lil.

02:40.463 --> 02:43.536
And still. It's still really awkward right now.

02:45.311 --> 02:47.738
Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?

02:47.743 --> 02:49.531
Okay, your job is very simple.

02:49.531 --> 02:54.717
At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.

02:57.061 --> 02:59.026
Lil, you know I can't promise that.

03:04.002 --> 03:05.446
Shh! Shh!

03:05.673 --> 03:08.916
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.

03:10.362 --> 03:11.688
Hey, babe.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.763
Hey, little one.

03:13.763 --> 03:15.856
- Hey, Lilypad.
- Crap!

03:15.901 --> 03:18.070
Band! We forgot a band!

03:18.070 --> 03:20.990
It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.143
Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it.

03:23.143 --> 03:25.082
I called The 88!

03:25.082 --> 03:26.941
- Who?
- The 88.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.291
They're this awesome band.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.810
They played my law review party. They were found guilty.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.851
On three counts of rocking.

03:32.851 --> 03:35.936
I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.681
John "Bonzo" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?

03:38.681 --> 03:41.277
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin,

03:41.281 --> 03:44.465
who died in 1980, got married two months ago.

03:44.942 --> 03:48.100
Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.382
We... we don't even know if they can play our song.

03:50.382 --> 03:52.890
They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.733
Baby, The 88 don't audition.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.905
They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.708
Well, then... I have to say no.

04:00.862 --> 04:03.180
Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.368
Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?

04:07.013 --> 04:08.758
Let me check their Website.

04:09.912 --> 04:11.006
What?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.781
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.

04:13.781 --> 04:15.091
Intense?

04:15.091 --> 04:19.471
I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people.

04:19.471 --> 04:24.383
Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table,

04:24.383 --> 04:26.698
I need you to roll with it, okay?

04:26.770 --> 04:28.087
Wow.

04:28.612 --> 04:32.051
Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.

04:32.051 --> 04:33.306
We already have a caterer.

04:33.312 --> 04:35.328
Oh, right. You're getting married.

04:35.523 --> 04:38.105
You see what I did there? Took a...

04:38.341 --> 04:44.252
It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.

04:44.252 --> 04:46.682
A prom? Can... can we go to that?

04:46.682 --> 04:49.918
Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

04:50.843 --> 04:52.465
Yeah. No, they won't.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.590
Why not?

04:53.590 --> 04:55.423
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.

04:55.423 --> 04:57.022
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.

04:57.022 --> 04:59.101
We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.

04:59.101 --> 05:01.123
Yes, we are. It's the only way.

05:01.123 --> 05:04.816
You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.661
It's nine weeks till the wedding.

05:06.661 --> 05:09.611
At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.

05:09.611 --> 05:11.395
- Well...
- No, Barney.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.795
And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.

05:17.802 --> 05:19.518
- I'll go with you.
- Really?

05:19.521 --> 05:21.100
Yeah. I never got to go to my prom.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.835
We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.095
Lesbian.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.992
The cough is supposed to cover the "lesbian."

05:28.992 --> 05:31.478
No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.

05:32.470 --> 05:35.530
Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?

05:35.530 --> 05:38.393
Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep,

05:38.393 --> 05:41.147
and you've got "statutory" written all over your body.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.343
Hey, why don't we all go?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.621
I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in.

05:45.621 --> 05:47.907
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.700
Yeah, you're right.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.862
Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding.

05:52.862 --> 05:54.292
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?

05:54.292 --> 05:55.563
Sounds awesome.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.641
We should go out and just get freakin' weird.

05:57.641 --> 05:58.292
Yeah.

05:58.292 --> 06:02.133
'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.868
What?

06:04.120 --> 06:08.871
Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear?

06:08.871 --> 06:10.418
Lame!

06:11.551 --> 06:14.875
But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.

06:17.872 --> 06:19.956
All right, what do you think?

06:20.523 --> 06:21.808
Horrible.

06:22.313 --> 06:24.576
You're gonna make such a great dad.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.040
You look so classy and nice.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.700
You're going to stick out like a sore thumb.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.860
Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days,

06:30.860 --> 06:33.358
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris?

06:33.362 --> 06:34.818
They all dress like strippers.

06:34.823 --> 06:37.435
It's go ho or go home.

06:37.702 --> 06:39.392
Well, we have to get in.

06:39.392 --> 06:42.283
I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday,

06:42.283 --> 06:45.192
'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...

06:45.192 --> 06:48.673
Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay?

06:48.673 --> 06:51.620
Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.830
All right.

06:52.830 --> 06:56.728
That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!

06:59.620 --> 07:02.072
I never thought this would be a bad thing,

07:02.072 --> 07:04.905
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.452
I didn't know I still had this.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.843
What?

07:09.993 --> 07:12.977
The dress I wore to my actual prom.

07:17.773 --> 07:21.251
Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom,

07:21.251 --> 07:25.858
and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot.

07:25.861 --> 07:27.498
Like a hot soul.

07:28.232 --> 07:30.803
Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.

07:30.803 --> 07:32.231
So big news.

07:32.231 --> 07:35.200
I heard from umpire school. I'm in!

07:35.200 --> 07:37.706
Oh, disco!

07:37.782 --> 07:40.601
I am so happy for you.

07:40.601 --> 07:44.001
You mean happy for us, right, babe?

07:44.001 --> 07:47.681
Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.

07:47.681 --> 07:49.092
No, baby.

07:49.092 --> 07:52.268
We're gonna be an umpire someday.

07:53.762 --> 07:58.341
Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.

07:58.341 --> 08:00.390
No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go.

08:00.390 --> 08:01.553
I'm not showing anymore...

08:01.553 --> 08:05.080
Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.826
Aw. Sweet.

08:07.830 --> 08:09.706
Thank you.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.920
Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?

08:12.920 --> 08:14.423
No.

08:14.423 --> 08:17.428
I've never been to prom before, okay?

08:17.582 --> 08:18.930
We got to go. See ya.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.147
Bye, have fun.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.605
See you.

08:23.151 --> 08:26.293
They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?

08:26.293 --> 08:27.841
So, what, we ready for tonight?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.912
Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.

08:29.912 --> 08:30.861
Shot of Jim Beam?

08:30.861 --> 08:32.111
- Yeah.
- Yes!

08:32.111 --> 08:35.763
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.

08:35.763 --> 08:36.616
What?!

08:36.623 --> 08:39.297
I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.136
Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break.

08:42.140 --> 08:46.142
Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad,

08:46.142 --> 08:49.481
but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.

08:49.481 --> 08:52.313
Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it.

08:52.313 --> 08:55.905
First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.

08:55.913 --> 08:57.846
Do I look like I'm four?

08:58.011 --> 09:00.236
All right, what kind of prize are we talking?

09:02.301 --> 09:05.210
Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.491
Is this gonna work?

09:06.491 --> 09:10.572
Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time.

09:10.572 --> 09:12.703
It's all about confidence.

09:12.703 --> 09:14.077
Follow me.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.983
Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody.

09:16.983 --> 09:18.820
Going to prom-- whee-hoo!

09:18.820 --> 09:21.818
- Uh, you're adults.
- Okay, bye.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.623
Okay, look, I just need to see the band.

09:25.623 --> 09:27.790
I'm getting married in two months, and...

09:27.790 --> 09:29.830
And you're just finding a band?

09:29.830 --> 09:31.646
Hey, ho, hey!

09:32.100 --> 09:36.616
I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.

09:38.980 --> 09:42.150
Wow. "Ma'am?" Check and mate.

09:42.150 --> 09:44.681
It's cool. Time to activate plan B.

09:44.681 --> 09:47.635
Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow?

09:47.653 --> 09:49.248
Scherbotsky?

09:49.730 --> 09:53.665
Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?

09:54.142 --> 09:56.185
We don't have that kind of money.

09:56.482 --> 09:57.607
For free.

09:57.612 --> 09:59.172
Oh, hell yeah!

09:59.172 --> 10:01.623
Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.

10:01.623 --> 10:04.027
- Hi. Shall we?
- Sure.

10:05.152 --> 10:08.117
I knew it would happen. This is the dream.

10:08.812 --> 10:10.571
Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?

10:10.571 --> 10:12.885
Don't worry about me. I'll get in.

10:13.391 --> 10:16.465
Oh... I'll get in.

10:29.342 --> 10:30.133
We're in!

10:30.133 --> 10:31.881
Thank you. We're going to take a break.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.116
Oh, you're kidding me.

10:33.190 --> 10:37.128
Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?

10:38.270 --> 10:41.077
Yeah, what the hell? It's prom.

10:45.193 --> 10:46.821
That tastes like cough syrup.

10:46.821 --> 10:48.873
Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol.

10:48.873 --> 10:51.031
Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20.

10:51.031 --> 10:53.416
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.

10:53.832 --> 10:56.127
Nerds who aren't good at math?

10:56.231 --> 10:58.308
Life's going to be rough, boys.

11:01.173 --> 11:03.123
Hi. Excuse me.

11:03.123 --> 11:06.840
I was wondering if you guys could play "Good Feeling" by the Violent Femmes.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.783
I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married

11:09.783 --> 11:12.411
and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band,

11:12.411 --> 11:15.851
but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play "Good Feeling" because that's our song,

11:15.851 --> 11:20.020
and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?

11:20.020 --> 11:24.313
Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that.

11:24.313 --> 11:27.807
But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.

11:28.283 --> 11:31.506
So, you buzzing, baby?

11:31.921 --> 11:34.116
My phlegm feels looser.

11:46.551 --> 11:48.128
This is pathetic.

11:48.130 --> 11:52.205
It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights.

11:52.882 --> 11:55.053
If I got in a fight, would you have my back?

11:55.053 --> 11:56.666
You know it.

11:57.781 --> 11:59.468
I'd have your back, too.

12:00.690 --> 12:01.846
That's cool.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.607
What, you don't think you'd need my help?

12:06.071 --> 12:08.398
You don't know what I can do. I'm like...

12:09.181 --> 12:10.553
like a berserker.

12:10.553 --> 12:11.885
Okay, Ted.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.162
Hello.

12:13.162 --> 12:16.680
Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music

12:16.680 --> 12:20.302
for "Good Feeling" and bring it out here, like, now.

12:20.302 --> 12:21.341
Hang on.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.435
It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom.

12:24.963 --> 12:26.648
- Can Ted come?
- Wait! Don't ask!

12:26.651 --> 12:28.081
That's so lame!

12:28.081 --> 12:30.115
I don't even want to go anyway.

12:30.333 --> 12:34.081
Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.

12:34.081 --> 12:35.757
What'd she say? What'd she say?

12:36.221 --> 12:40.797
He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me.

12:40.802 --> 12:45.175
I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive.

12:45.422 --> 12:48.711
Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's,

12:48.711 --> 12:51.091
it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.606
Okay, bye.

12:53.952 --> 12:55.998
She totally wants you to come.

13:00.022 --> 13:02.888
All right, sheet music's on the way.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.785
Are you okay?

13:06.200 --> 13:10.333
There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling.

13:10.333 --> 13:13.453
It's just all moving too fast.

13:13.453 --> 13:17.183
How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.

13:17.183 --> 13:22.290
I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.

13:22.290 --> 13:23.611
What's decided?

13:23.611 --> 13:25.903
I go to umpire school, you go to college.

13:25.903 --> 13:28.023
We move into my dad's house in Staten Island.

13:28.023 --> 13:31.161
We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided?

13:31.161 --> 13:32.848
It's wide open!

13:33.711 --> 13:39.738
Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.427
You're, you're breaking up with me?

13:43.432 --> 13:45.930
There's still so much I want to do.

13:45.930 --> 13:50.032
I want to travel, live overseas as an artist,

13:50.032 --> 13:52.848
maybe have a lesbian relationship.

13:53.391 --> 13:58.260
Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.165
I can't believe this.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.340
I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.415
Please, just don't leave me.

14:05.521 --> 14:07.412
I'm nothing without you, baby.

14:07.412 --> 14:11.603
Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!

14:11.603 --> 14:14.313
It's just one dance, God!

14:14.313 --> 14:15.567
What?

14:15.573 --> 14:17.655
Well, we did promise them one dance.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.308
Yeah, sure, okay.

14:28.013 --> 14:31.220
So Andrew, what's your big plan?

14:31.220 --> 14:33.671
What's life going to be like after tonight?

14:33.671 --> 14:35.811
Well, you know I got it all worked out.

14:35.811 --> 14:39.263
Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college,

14:39.263 --> 14:43.566
and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.

14:43.572 --> 14:45.563
- No, you won't.
- I won't?

14:45.563 --> 14:49.023
No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to.

14:49.023 --> 14:53.061
You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence

14:53.061 --> 14:55.631
and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old

14:55.631 --> 14:59.271
before your time wondering "Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"

14:59.271 --> 15:00.433
Whoa.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.827
You really think I'll get a girlfriend?

15:04.491 --> 15:08.478
So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?

15:08.492 --> 15:11.846
Oh, Sean, look, um,

15:11.853 --> 15:15.276
you're a nice guy, but I just don't...

15:17.513 --> 15:19.918
No, you're not getting lucky tonight.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.508
Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.746
Okay.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.341
How'd you get in here?

15:39.341 --> 15:42.086
What's it to you, giant turtle?

15:42.473 --> 15:44.496
It's me, Barney.

15:44.592 --> 15:47.081
Oh, hey. Where's Lily?

15:47.081 --> 15:48.473
She's in the bathroom.

15:48.473 --> 15:50.613
- Wait here, I should go talk to the band.
- All right.

15:50.613 --> 15:51.821
How did you guys get in here?

15:51.821 --> 15:52.922
We just snuck in the back.

15:52.922 --> 15:55.292
You just snu... Are you serious?

15:55.292 --> 15:57.310
I've been trying to get in here all night.

15:57.310 --> 16:02.382
I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.

16:02.382 --> 16:03.938
But you got in.

16:04.243 --> 16:06.896
Slow and steady won the race.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.990
Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?

16:11.990 --> 16:13.401
Your fiancée?

16:13.401 --> 16:16.190
Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro.

16:16.190 --> 16:18.178
Unless you're looking for trouble.

16:18.192 --> 16:21.482
Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...

16:21.482 --> 16:23.550
No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.951
I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.

16:26.951 --> 16:28.663
Whoa, whoa.

16:28.663 --> 16:30.332
Look, let's not get carried away.

16:30.332 --> 16:32.375
Yah! Nunchaku!

16:35.961 --> 16:39.263
I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.

16:39.263 --> 16:42.456
I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.030
I'm going to ask you something and, um,

16:47.030 --> 16:50.290
maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever.

16:50.290 --> 16:54.045
But, um, are you having second thoughts?

16:56.541 --> 16:57.785
Yeah.

16:58.093 --> 17:00.091
But not about Marshall.

17:00.091 --> 17:01.582
About me.

17:01.582 --> 17:05.925
I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago

17:05.932 --> 17:08.847
and wondering what happened to her.

17:08.942 --> 17:10.776
I don't want to be tied down.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.932
I want to live in France and Spain and Italy

17:13.932 --> 17:17.741
and just soak up life and put it on a canvas,

17:17.741 --> 17:22.590
even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.112
I'm going to be a painter.

17:24.112 --> 17:29.668
And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.132
But anyway, I'm blabbering.

17:33.132 --> 17:35.447
Way to make new friends, Lily.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.777
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

17:38.793 --> 17:40.327
Marshall.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.103
Nice to meet you, Marshall.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.036
Guess we're hallmates.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.488
Yeah.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.815
It works.

17:51.073 --> 17:53.767
Violent Femmes. I love this song.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.618
Me, too.

17:58.573 --> 18:02.795
I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to.

18:03.002 --> 18:06.460
The travel, the bohemian art life,

18:06.460 --> 18:09.090
my big lesbian experience.

18:09.090 --> 18:11.268
I didn't do any of it.

18:11.641 --> 18:15.790
Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world.

18:15.790 --> 18:19.798
I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?

18:20.743 --> 18:22.267
Yeah.

18:22.271 --> 18:25.890
And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint.

18:25.890 --> 18:29.016
And as far as your lesbian experience...

18:31.800 --> 18:32.966
Happy?

18:33.060 --> 18:34.317
Yeah.

18:34.553 --> 18:37.825
- So field hockey, huh? 
- Shut up.

18:39.563 --> 18:42.723
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.

18:42.723 --> 18:46.298
This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000.

18:46.303 --> 18:48.462
We can have you guys arrested, you know that?

18:48.462 --> 18:50.962
Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus.

18:50.962 --> 18:53.692
You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.

18:53.692 --> 18:54.873
I totally could have taken that kid.

18:54.873 --> 18:56.780
Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...

18:56.780 --> 18:58.013
Well, I don't need it, but thanks.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.452
Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.

18:59.452 --> 19:02.595
No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic.

19:02.843 --> 19:06.550
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.

19:06.550 --> 19:08.177
Absolutely not.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.247
You guys will thank me for this later, okay?

19:12.921 --> 19:17.296
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?
- Hey!

19:19.372 --> 19:22.045
You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.

19:25.010 --> 19:28.967
This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.

19:53.081 --> 19:55.535
So how was your first prom?

19:55.541 --> 19:56.807
You tell me.

19:56.813 --> 20:00.590
I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me,

20:00.590 --> 20:03.988
there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.

20:03.990 --> 20:06.737
So, basically, it was a prom.

20:08.212 --> 20:10.157
Okay, I've missed you.

20:10.350 --> 20:13.077
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

20:13.173 --> 20:16.185
not even in an I-forgive-you way.

20:16.553 --> 20:19.037
Just in a I've-missed-you way.

20:19.941 --> 20:21.808
I'll take what I can get.

20:24.342 --> 20:27.520
And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth

20:27.520 --> 20:30.326
when you wear jeans to a strip club.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.790
So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.

20:36.790 --> 20:38.875
Yeah, it's good.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.745
Band? Check.

20:42.462 --> 20:44.267
Two months, baby.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.215
Two months.

20:47.361 --> 20:49.047
Two months.
