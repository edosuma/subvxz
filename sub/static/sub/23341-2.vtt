00:31.255 --> 00:33.188
"Then you pass by this big glass case

00:33.224 --> 00:34.890
with Indians inside it,

00:34.925 --> 00:35.958
rubbing sticks together

00:35.993 --> 00:37.960
to make a fire.

00:37.995 --> 00:42.331
The best thing, though, in that museum,
was that everything always stayed

00:42.366 --> 00:46.335
right where it was. Nobody'd move.

00:46.370 --> 00:52.307
Nobody'd be different. The only thing
that would be different would be you."

01:09.126 --> 01:10.225
Come on.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.130
Seriously?

01:17.234 --> 01:20.069
Here. Try this.

01:20.104 --> 01:23.005
Thank you. Stupid machines...

01:24.108 --> 01:25.140
Yep.

01:26.277 --> 01:28.010
Thank you.

01:37.888 --> 01:39.021
Is it good?

01:39.056 --> 01:41.857
- I'm sorry?
- The book.

01:41.892 --> 01:42.925
Is it good?

01:44.228 --> 01:47.162
It is. It's my son's favorite.

01:47.198 --> 01:48.997
He's named after the main character.

01:49.033 --> 01:50.099
Holden.

01:52.002 --> 01:53.135
What's it about?

01:55.139 --> 01:57.039
It's about...

01:58.109 --> 01:59.908
being a teenager.

01:59.944 --> 02:02.878
Feeling like you're lost
in the world around you.

02:02.913 --> 02:04.012
Not knowing your place.

02:05.149 --> 02:06.949
Sounds like a sad book.

02:08.051 --> 02:09.017
Parts.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.286
But it's also hopeful.

02:11.322 --> 02:14.289
Holden, in the book, he has this dream,

02:14.325 --> 02:17.092
and in the dream, he's standing
at the edge of a cliff,

02:17.128 --> 02:19.194
and he's catching all these children

02:19.230 --> 02:22.097
before they can run off the edge.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.199
Like he's their protector.

02:24.235 --> 02:28.070
I guess I like thinking of my
own Holden as a protector.

02:28.105 --> 02:30.005
As a hero.

02:31.342 --> 02:32.941
You're here for your son.

02:34.879 --> 02:37.212
He fell off his bike and hit his head.

02:37.248 --> 02:39.014
That was almost eight years ago.

02:41.018 --> 02:42.217
What about you?

02:42.253 --> 02:44.219
Who are you here for?

02:44.255 --> 02:45.854
My grandfather.

02:46.957 --> 02:48.991
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:49.026 --> 02:50.192
You two must be close.

02:53.097 --> 02:54.997
He's the only family I've got.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.033
It's not easy, is it?

02:59.203 --> 03:00.836
The waiting.

03:02.973 --> 03:04.106
None of it's easy.

03:10.848 --> 03:12.815
When you let your mind wander?

03:12.850 --> 03:14.950
I know regret is a waste of energy,

03:14.985 --> 03:16.251
but even after all these years,

03:16.287 --> 03:17.886
I still feel like,

03:17.922 --> 03:20.122
I should have been there to stop him

03:20.157 --> 03:24.226
from... running off the cliff.

03:24.261 --> 03:27.095
I'm his mother. I should've
beenthere to catch him.

03:29.266 --> 03:30.933
You're here for him now.

03:32.002 --> 03:34.102
And you'll be here for him
when he wakes up.

03:35.873 --> 03:38.307
I just wish I knew what was
going on inside his head.

03:40.044 --> 03:42.010
I wish he knew how much we miss him.

03:48.352 --> 03:49.918
He knows.

03:52.256 --> 03:55.891
And if he were here, I'm sure
he'd say he misses you, too.

03:59.096 --> 04:01.897
I'm sure he'd tell you not to give up.

04:03.968 --> 04:07.970
All of this is just temporary.

04:08.005 --> 04:10.622
It's only a matter of time
before he wakes up,

04:10.622 --> 04:12.592
and you can be a family again.

04:14.278 --> 04:16.077
You just have to wait
a little while longer.

04:37.234 --> 04:39.935
Just a little while longer.

04:46.243 --> 04:48.277
You know you're not
saving any money

04:48.312 --> 04:49.845
by buying ground coffee.

04:49.880 --> 04:50.913
Shh!

04:50.948 --> 04:55.050
If anything it's like,
10 cents less than whole bean,

04:55.085 --> 04:56.919
and you're missing out
on the full-bodied taste.

04:56.954 --> 04:58.954
Uh... Ground coffee's
the same amount of caffeine.

04:58.989 --> 05:00.055
If I wanted it to taste good,

05:00.090 --> 05:01.189
I'd add ice cream.

05:01.225 --> 05:04.159
Mom, you haven't seen
my work shirt, have you?

05:04.194 --> 05:06.061
The one that I washed two days ago,

05:06.096 --> 05:08.196
folded neatly, and put on your dresser?

05:08.232 --> 05:10.799
Maybe. Thanks.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.234
Hey, you feeling all right?

05:12.269 --> 05:13.969
Did you sleep?

05:14.004 --> 05:15.904
Uh, yeah. I slept.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.839
What's that?

05:18.909 --> 05:20.175
Did you do something to your wrist?

05:20.210 --> 05:22.811
- No, it's fine. No.
- No, here... let me see that.

05:22.846 --> 05:24.980
Mom, it's fine, I hit it on the bedpost.

05:25.015 --> 05:26.148
Still gettin' used to the new bed.

05:26.183 --> 05:28.917
Holden, please.
If something's the matter...

05:28.953 --> 05:30.919
Nothing's the matter, okay? I'm great.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.921
Things are going great.
I've got a job, that's great,

05:32.957 --> 05:34.189
I'm seeing a girl, that's going great.

05:34.224 --> 05:36.224
You're seeing Charlie?

05:36.260 --> 05:37.926
I didn't know you two were official.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.829
- Who's Charlie?
- No, she's...

05:40.864 --> 05:42.965
Was not Charlie.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.099
Uh, her name's Willa.

05:44.134 --> 05:45.934
Who's Willa?

05:46.971 --> 05:48.270
She's my...

05:48.305 --> 05:51.039
Mom, I... I've mentioned Willa before.

05:51.075 --> 05:53.208
Uh, she's, uh, she's great.

05:53.243 --> 05:55.177
- Super chill.
- Good.

05:55.212 --> 05:57.045
So, do I get to meet her?

05:57.081 --> 05:58.947
Why?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.116
Why?

06:01.151 --> 06:03.018
Because Holden, you've got
this whole other life

06:03.053 --> 06:04.186
I don't know about.

06:04.221 --> 06:06.788
I'm not talking about anything formal,

06:06.824 --> 06:09.157
just... why can't she
come over for dinner?

06:13.130 --> 06:15.931
I... don't see why not.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.033
Good.

06:22.206 --> 06:24.906
Well, this could be interesting.

06:42.326 --> 06:45.227
Hey, maybe later we could...
have a picnic.

06:47.297 --> 06:48.897
The weather's nice.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.067
We can sit under the black willow,

06:52.102 --> 06:53.135
like we used to.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.038
Yeah... maybe another time.

06:56.073 --> 06:58.173
I just have so much to do.

07:07.184 --> 07:09.117
Open your eyes, Daniel.

07:09.153 --> 07:13.021
I mean, this machine,
it's all he's concerned with.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.057
He doesn't eat. He doesn't sleep.

07:15.092 --> 07:17.259
On a human level, this isn't healthy.

07:17.294 --> 07:20.929
Arthur is not ready
to give up on his life's work.

07:20.964 --> 07:24.232
It's over. Holden destroyed the bridge.

07:24.268 --> 07:27.202
Just like Arthur wanted.

07:27.237 --> 07:29.137
Well, it's not like flipping a switch.

07:30.207 --> 07:33.809
Arthur put everything he had
into this research.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.845
He still believes this machine
can take him to see Celeste.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.979
But he's wrong.

07:39.183 --> 07:40.882
How can you be so sure?

07:42.986 --> 07:45.220
We both know he's at his best
when he's indulging in obsession.

07:45.255 --> 07:47.923
He's at his best
when he's a grandfather.

07:50.060 --> 07:52.928
That machine, it's just an distraction.

07:52.963 --> 07:55.964
I have to believe he's capable
of getting on with his life.

07:58.068 --> 08:01.103
I have to believe he's capable
of moving forward.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.943
Twenty-two weeks,
that would be, um...?

08:08.011 --> 08:08.977
August 19th.

08:09.012 --> 08:09.978
When's your birthday?

08:10.013 --> 08:11.012
November 3rd.

08:11.048 --> 08:12.013
I'm the 11th.

08:12.049 --> 08:13.415
You're kidding.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.017
My wife and I, we had our first
date on November 11, 2014.

08:16.053 --> 08:18.086
That's... such a coincidence.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.021
Are you still with your partner?

08:20.057 --> 08:22.190
I... I didn't see a wedding ring,
so I just assumed...

08:22.226 --> 08:25.927
It was just a... one-time thing.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.929
Drunken night in a motel room.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.965
Uh, but it was a night I'll...

08:45.883 --> 08:47.048
Twenty-two weeks, that would be...

08:47.084 --> 08:48.216
Oh! August 19th, August 19th.

08:50.020 --> 08:51.253
Scorpio, when's your birthday?

08:51.288 --> 08:52.287
November 3rd.

08:52.322 --> 08:53.288
Wow.

08:54.324 --> 08:56.158
That's such a coincidence.

08:56.193 --> 08:57.859
- I'm the 11th.
- You're kidding.

08:57.895 --> 08:59.027
That's our anniversary. Anniversary...

08:59.062 --> 09:01.062
November 11, 2014.

10:03.026 --> 10:04.893
Cheers, bitch.

10:08.998 --> 10:12.584
I didn't mean to I just blurted it out.

10:13.303 --> 10:15.337
I don't know, maybe
it's not such a bad thing.

10:15.372 --> 10:17.172
We weren't gonna keep it
a secret forever, right?

10:17.207 --> 10:19.408
At some point, my parents
were gonna have to meet you.

10:19.443 --> 10:21.276
But it's not just one secret.

10:21.311 --> 10:23.245
You and me and everything
that we've been through

10:23.280 --> 10:26.314
doesn't really make for the most
routine dinner conversation.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.617
Right, so...

10:28.652 --> 10:31.386
So we... talk about something else.

10:32.589 --> 10:36.491
Look, uh... I know it's just
a stupid dinner,

10:36.527 --> 10:39.194
so, I get if you're not
into it, so don't...

10:39.229 --> 10:40.362
I don't think it's a good idea.

10:40.397 --> 10:42.597
I'm nervous, Holden.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.633
We have so many secrets.

10:44.668 --> 10:46.468
Yeah.

10:46.503 --> 10:48.170
Right, of course, um...

10:48.205 --> 10:49.471
Another time.

10:51.241 --> 10:52.307
Matthews!

10:52.342 --> 10:53.608
Uh, I gotta go, talk to you tonight.

10:53.644 --> 10:55.243
Sorry. Family emergency.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.279
We need to have a talk. Five minutes.

10:59.316 --> 11:00.449
We?

11:01.618 --> 11:04.453
Holden... close the door, take a seat.

11:18.368 --> 11:21.269
We know you haven't been
at the company for long.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.745
Hell, we knew when we hired you
that the warehouse would be

11:23.745 --> 11:25.890
more of a trial period for you.

11:27.411 --> 11:29.444
Your days of unpacking boxes are over.

11:34.451 --> 11:39.354
Holden... we're promoting you.

11:39.389 --> 11:41.670
You'll be working alongside
Steven here until he can make

11:41.670 --> 11:42.558
a full recovery.

11:42.559 --> 11:44.593
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

11:44.628 --> 11:45.627
It was an easy decision,

11:45.662 --> 11:47.596
what with the reduction in productivity,

11:47.631 --> 11:50.465
and on account of Stevie's
motorcycle accident...

11:50.501 --> 11:52.140
Motorcycle accident?

11:52.140 --> 11:53.502
We needed somebody who was motivated.

11:53.537 --> 11:55.170
A quick learner.

11:55.205 --> 11:56.371
I'm not sure I follow.

11:56.406 --> 11:58.173
You want me to train him?

11:58.208 --> 12:00.475
I'm buried in orders as it is, I don't
have time to hold his hand.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.379
That's exactly why we need him
at your desk, to lighten the load.

12:04.414 --> 12:09.251
Thank you. Both of you, I...
don't know what to say.

12:09.286 --> 12:11.419
Well, say goodbye to your box cutter.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.488
Why don't you give him a quick rundown?

12:13.524 --> 12:17.159
Give him some time to get his head
around his new responsibilities, okay?

12:28.472 --> 12:29.538
Hey, son?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.343
I'm proud of you.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.379
Congratulations.

12:37.414 --> 12:39.347
You deserve it.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.448
Thanks, Dad.

14:14.311 --> 14:18.246
And here I thought your idea of fun
was setting fire to homeless shelters.

14:36.542 --> 14:41.200
Parts like engine units or wheels, once
they go through shipping and receiving,

14:41.428 --> 14:42.694
they come here.

14:42.729 --> 14:46.173
It's your job to record the receipts
and report any discrepancies

14:46.227 --> 14:48.026
with the orders.

14:48.062 --> 14:49.294
This is you.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.496
Get comfy.

14:50.531 --> 14:52.364
'Cause your ass ain't leavin'
till that pile disappears.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.201
Are these... Are these all from today?

14:56.237 --> 14:57.369
It's barely noon, Matthews.

14:57.404 --> 14:59.171
It's from this morning.

14:59.206 --> 15:01.340
Now, the work orders gotta get
entered into the ERP,

15:01.375 --> 15:05.277
but the FAA still requires a physical
paper logbook for every aircraft.

15:05.312 --> 15:08.313
Leave it to the government to be 15
years behind the rest of the country.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.350
Guess that's more your speed, ain't it?

15:11.385 --> 15:14.281
Livin' in the past
while the rest of us move on.

15:14.568 --> 15:17.936
A decade late and a dollar short.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.427
Listen, Steven, about what happened
at the bar the other night?

15:21.462 --> 15:22.561
Nothin' happened at the bar.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.531
- Right, but...
- No buts.

15:25.566 --> 15:27.266
Nothin' happened.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.434
Let's leave it at that.

15:31.672 --> 15:34.206
I drank too much.

15:34.241 --> 15:35.474
That's what happened.

15:35.509 --> 15:38.310
Hell, I was so smashed I couldn't
tell you what happened.

15:38.345 --> 15:39.578
Only nothin' happened.

15:40.714 --> 15:42.314
Uh, yeah.

15:42.349 --> 15:43.348
I get it.

15:44.452 --> 15:46.418
This ain't unpackin'
engine parts, Matthews.

15:46.454 --> 15:49.354
You send a part through to the floor
without checkin' it off,

15:49.390 --> 15:52.224
and you're gonna stop the line,
and cripple this entire company.

15:52.259 --> 15:55.627
If that happens,
nobody, not your old man,

15:55.663 --> 15:58.297
not even your girl
will be around to bail you out.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.366
You get it?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.440
I was only a few minutes late.

16:08.476 --> 16:10.476
Forty-seven minutes.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.577
Forty-seven minutes isn't even late,

16:11.612 --> 16:14.313
it's someone else's appointment.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.515
We rescheduled this OB three times so
that you could make it work.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.250
Something came up at the last minute.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.518
I know you've been hearing that
a lot lately.

16:19.553 --> 16:21.520
That's all I've been hearing lately.

16:21.555 --> 16:24.289
I could set my watch by "something
came up last minute."

16:24.325 --> 16:26.225
You're right. Haven't been as present

16:26.260 --> 16:27.493
- as I'd like to be.
- Then change.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.561
It's entirely in your power.

16:29.597 --> 16:33.332
I'm just so sick of feelin' like you're
using work as some kind of escape.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.400
I don't want you ever feelin' like that.

16:35.436 --> 16:37.269
You're my escape.

16:40.407 --> 16:41.673
You're my everything.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.676
Both of you.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.546
We're all in this together, I promise.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.517
You're my family.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.254
You deserve 110 percent of my attention.

16:55.289 --> 16:57.256
And my affection.

17:02.229 --> 17:06.198
You are a long way away
from 110 percent.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.267
Well, good thing we have all afternoon.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.438
Come on.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.507
Just hold one second.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.209
I'll be right there.

18:34.622 --> 18:36.321
Huh!

18:47.468 --> 18:49.234
- Ow!
- Jah!

18:49.270 --> 18:50.402
Ohhh!

18:50.437 --> 18:52.437
What the hell's the matter with you?

18:57.478 --> 18:59.678
You're a freak, Matthews.

18:59.713 --> 19:01.446
You gonna help me with this?

19:09.223 --> 19:10.489
Stop it!

19:10.524 --> 19:12.224
Arthur!

19:12.259 --> 19:13.625
Open this door, Willa.

19:13.661 --> 19:15.460
I'm afraid I can't do that.

19:16.597 --> 19:18.397
Open the door.

19:18.432 --> 19:19.531
No.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.600
I'm worried about you.

19:21.635 --> 19:24.636
You've been so consumed by this machine.

19:24.672 --> 19:27.472
Trying to fix something
that doesn't need to be fixed.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.411
I feel like... I'm losing you.

19:32.446 --> 19:36.415
Willa... you of all people
should understand.

19:36.450 --> 19:38.617
This is our only chance
to see my daughter.

19:38.652 --> 19:41.286
Your mother.

19:41.322 --> 19:43.188
Do you even hear yourself?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.490
Do you know who you sound like?

19:45.526 --> 19:49.361
You told me you and Holden
made it into the light.

19:49.396 --> 19:53.632
But there's more. There's so much more
to discover on the other side.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.368
I didn't tell you everything, okay?

19:58.339 --> 20:01.473
Frost forced me and Holden
into the Realm.

20:01.508 --> 20:04.643
He wanted Holden to take him to
the bridge, so he could see Celeste.

20:04.678 --> 20:07.379
Then Holden, he made the bridge appear.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.514
And with it, Celeste.

20:09.550 --> 20:13.618
And I wanted so badly to believe
that that was my mother.

20:13.654 --> 20:17.289
I wanted so badly to reach out
and touch her.

20:17.324 --> 20:19.224
But it wasn't her.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.426
And then I saw her
for what she really was...

20:21.462 --> 20:24.629
a hideous, horrible creature that
sucked the life out of Frost.

21:00.095 --> 21:03.096
Oh, it's a miracle. I think I
finally got him to sleep.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.165
Don't say it too loud, you'll jinx it.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.267
Heh... How are you
and that swing gettin' along?

21:07.302 --> 21:10.036
It's gonna take more than a miracle.

21:10.072 --> 21:13.373
I can't even imagine what it would be
like if it was just me and Landon.

21:13.408 --> 21:16.243
It'll never be just you and Landon.

21:16.278 --> 21:17.277
You're family.

21:19.381 --> 21:22.382
- For better, for worse, right?
- I got him, I got him.

21:24.419 --> 21:27.454
This thing is the Kobayashi Maru
of baby swings.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.323
Thank you.

21:30.359 --> 21:31.391
Of course.

21:34.463 --> 21:37.844
I know that you are very modest,
Holden, but, uh,

21:37.844 --> 21:39.467
if you don't say something, I will.

21:39.468 --> 21:40.433
Say what?

21:42.104 --> 21:43.370
What happened at work today.

21:43.405 --> 21:44.471
It's not a big deal.

21:44.506 --> 21:46.072
What's not a big deal?

21:46.108 --> 21:47.073
Last chance.

21:49.111 --> 21:50.443
Holden got a promotion today.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.180
You did? Oh, honey, that's fantastic.

21:54.216 --> 21:57.117
At this rate, he'll make project
manager before he's 30.

21:57.152 --> 21:59.319
Wow, someone really knows
how to dream big.

21:59.354 --> 22:02.233
Not everyone has the God-given
talent to craft the perfect

22:02.233 --> 22:03.357
vanilla soy frappuccino.

22:03.358 --> 22:04.391
Haters gonna hate.

22:07.362 --> 22:09.029
You expectin' someone?

22:09.064 --> 22:10.030
I'm not.

22:12.301 --> 22:15.035
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

22:15.070 --> 22:16.236
Can I help you?

22:16.271 --> 22:18.271
Holden invited me.

22:18.307 --> 22:20.040
For dinner.

22:20.075 --> 22:21.374
Every Sunday night at seven.

22:21.410 --> 22:23.076
Right?

22:23.111 --> 22:26.046
- Hm.
- I'm Willa. Holden's girlfriend.

22:27.249 --> 22:29.416
And that... is what makes
a perfect latte.

22:29.451 --> 22:30.417
- Mm...
- Holden?

22:30.452 --> 22:32.452
That...

22:32.487 --> 22:35.155
You didn't say you invited
your girlfriend to dinner.

22:35.190 --> 22:37.090
Good thing one of you remembered.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.460
Wait... What?

22:41.563 --> 22:43.330
You must be Willa.

22:43.365 --> 22:45.265
Holden's told us so much about you.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.233
He has?

22:47.269 --> 22:48.468
I can't imagine what he said.

22:48.503 --> 22:50.470
Hey...

22:50.505 --> 22:52.205
What are you doing here?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.174
You invited me. Don't worry.

22:54.209 --> 22:57.477
I... I didn't know what you were making,
so... I hope wine is okay.

22:57.512 --> 23:01.281
Oh, th... that is so sweet of you,
thank you, it's perfect.

23:01.316 --> 23:06.119
1998 Chateau... it's like $800 a bottle.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.456
Your house is beautiful.

23:09.491 --> 23:12.158
I can really picture Holden
growing up in a place like this.

23:12.194 --> 23:14.060
It's so warm and inviting.

23:14.096 --> 23:17.197
I am so sorry it has taken him
so long to bring you around.

23:17.232 --> 23:20.166
Oh, no, it's...
it's not his fault at all.

23:20.202 --> 23:22.068
Work has me traveling
all over the country,

23:22.104 --> 23:24.104
and it's been a crazy few weeks.

23:24.139 --> 23:25.238
What do you do for work?

23:25.273 --> 23:29.309
Sales. Well... pharmaceuticals.

23:31.079 --> 23:34.180
I sell pharmaceuticals,
but I don't like to advertise.

23:34.216 --> 23:36.182
Too many bad apples have made
Big Pharma out

23:36.218 --> 23:38.184
to be the villains
of the health care industry,

23:38.220 --> 23:40.286
when really we're doing more
to improve the quality of life

23:40.322 --> 23:42.222
than the top five
leading industries combined.

23:42.257 --> 23:47.260
I'll admit I've had to deal with my
share of greedy, misogynistic doctors.

23:47.295 --> 23:51.197
But it's a small price to pay for the
great benefits, and a company car.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.400
I'm sorry, have we met?

23:55.404 --> 23:57.404
It's just, you look so familiar.

24:02.244 --> 24:04.277
That depends.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.347
Have I ever sold you half a million
tablets of clonazepam?

24:20.061 --> 24:22.429
Mm. So how is it you two met?

24:24.132 --> 24:26.166
It's, uh... It's really
not that interesting.

24:26.201 --> 24:28.034
Friend of mine. From work.

24:28.069 --> 24:30.270
Well, actually,
it's my friend's boyfriend.

24:30.305 --> 24:32.439
- He went to college with Luke.
- Oh.

24:32.474 --> 24:34.073
I think he's about two years older.

24:34.109 --> 24:37.110
Yeah, yeah, totally, uh,
we had, uh, Econ together.

24:37.145 --> 24:38.478
Right. Econ.

24:38.513 --> 24:42.148
So he heard about Holden
through Luke, and then,

24:42.184 --> 24:44.083
he must've mentioned something to Cindy.

24:44.119 --> 24:45.218
That's my co-worker.

24:45.253 --> 24:47.487
And then we all met up at happy hour.

24:47.522 --> 24:50.507
Which Luke dragged
poor Holden to, pretending

24:50.507 --> 24:52.531
it was a... gosh, what was it?

24:53.295 --> 24:54.327
Shuffleboard tournament.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.096
Oh, right, shuffleboard.

24:57.132 --> 24:59.299
So, uh, Holden and I,
we started talking,

24:59.334 --> 25:02.302
and we discovered that we had
another mutual friend

25:02.337 --> 25:04.037
in Jeff McArdle.

25:04.072 --> 25:06.372
Wait... You know Jeff McArdle?

25:10.278 --> 25:11.544
They served together.

25:11.580 --> 25:16.316
Yeah. Cindy's boyfriend and Jeff
did a tour in Afghanistan.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.052
- Mm.
- Small world, right?

25:20.222 --> 25:21.221
Very small.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.258
I got promoted.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.394
I... I... I never had a chance
to tell you.

25:29.498 --> 25:31.130
That's so great.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.165
Congratulations.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.433
It's gonna be a lot
more responsibility...

25:33.468 --> 25:35.435
Well, I'm sure you can handle it.

25:35.470 --> 25:38.438
And who cares what that idiot Stevie
thinks, you worked so hard...

25:38.473 --> 25:40.373
Stevie? Stevie DeCecco?

25:43.278 --> 25:44.410
Did he say somethin' to you?

25:44.446 --> 25:46.312
No, uh, nothin'.

25:46.348 --> 25:48.081
You sure?

25:48.116 --> 25:49.415
'Cause if he's givin' you a hard time...

25:49.451 --> 25:51.251
No, Dad, he's not giving me a
hard time. It's fine.

25:51.286 --> 25:53.319
It wouldn't be the first time someone's
complained about Stevie...

25:53.355 --> 25:55.255
- I'm not complaining about him.
- I don't mean complain,

25:55.290 --> 25:57.665
what I mean is, Stevie can be
hard to deal with,

25:57.665 --> 25:59.192
- he rubs people the wrong way.
- The hospital.

26:01.096 --> 26:03.496
The hospital! You were in
the hospital, weren't you?

26:03.532 --> 26:05.131
In the cafeteria?

26:06.368 --> 26:08.034
You were visiting your grandfather.

26:09.137 --> 26:11.170
Right. Yes.

26:11.206 --> 26:12.338
I knew it, yes.

26:12.374 --> 26:14.374
You were, uh, reading that book.

26:14.409 --> 26:15.441
Catcher in the Rye.

26:15.477 --> 26:17.443
You were at the hospital?

26:20.115 --> 26:21.180
Small world, right?

26:22.284 --> 26:25.051
How is your grandfather?

26:25.086 --> 26:27.086
Um... he's better.

26:27.122 --> 26:28.388
He's doing much better.

26:28.423 --> 26:31.491
Oh, good. I knew you looked
familiar, I just couldn't place it.

26:31.526 --> 26:34.227
It's been a long time.

26:34.262 --> 26:35.428
It's been years.

26:35.463 --> 26:40.099
And then you two just find
each other, after all this time?

26:41.136 --> 26:43.369
Yeah. We're very lucky.

26:43.405 --> 26:46.439
Yeah... how did you say
you two met again?

26:46.474 --> 26:48.174
Uh... through me.

26:48.209 --> 26:50.443
Remember, your friend from school.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.046
Yeah, the friend in Afghanistan
with Jeff McArdle,

26:53.081 --> 26:55.181
but how is it exactly
that you know Jeff?

26:58.420 --> 26:59.519
Are you okay?

26:59.554 --> 27:01.187
- Yeah.
- Keep your hand up.

27:01.222 --> 27:02.343
I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened, I...

27:02.343 --> 27:04.751
Honey, it's okay. Any on you?

27:06.061 --> 27:07.126
So sorry.

27:09.030 --> 27:11.078
It's okay. We're good.

27:13.167 --> 27:15.100
What did you were doing,

27:15.136 --> 27:16.435
what was that in there?

27:16.470 --> 27:19.038
I got a bit carried away.

27:19.073 --> 27:21.106
You got carried away.

27:21.142 --> 27:22.341
Maybe, a little.

27:22.376 --> 27:24.977
It's like you were trying
to set some kind of speed record

27:25.012 --> 27:26.412
for the most lies in under 90 seconds.

27:26.447 --> 27:28.013
Why?

27:28.049 --> 27:30.115
I wanted your parents to like me.

27:30.151 --> 27:31.450
Well, I wanted them to like you, too,

27:31.485 --> 27:36.322
but that... wasn't you, that wasn't
who I fell in love with.

27:36.357 --> 27:39.992
The girl you fell in love with can't
just come over for family dinner,

27:40.027 --> 27:40.993
it doesn't work that way.

27:41.028 --> 27:42.394
- Why not?
- Because we're not normal.

27:47.268 --> 27:49.134
Look, what do we tell your parents?

27:49.170 --> 27:50.402
That we met in the Realm?

27:52.039 --> 27:53.172
That we spent the past 12 years together

27:53.207 --> 27:55.007
while you were lying in a coma?

27:57.511 --> 27:59.211
Why were you at the hospital?

28:00.214 --> 28:01.447
What?

28:01.482 --> 28:04.149
You met my mom at the hospital,
what were you doing there?

28:10.057 --> 28:13.158
I wanted to... be a part of your life.

28:14.395 --> 28:16.262
Your real life.

28:22.236 --> 28:25.271
I'm sorry, about tonight, I am.

28:25.306 --> 28:27.172
Maybe this was a mistake.

28:29.277 --> 28:30.409
Maybe it was.

28:49.263 --> 28:50.996
Hello, Christine.

28:51.032 --> 28:54.133
I'm sorry about the hour,
I hope I didn't wake the little guy.

28:54.168 --> 28:56.435
No, no, that would require him
to actually sleep.

28:58.372 --> 28:59.471
Do you wanna come in?

28:59.507 --> 29:02.074
Oh, thank you. Uh, no, I just stopped by

29:02.109 --> 29:04.329
so I could give you this...
it's just a...

29:04.329 --> 29:06.346
a little something
extra from the parish.

29:06.347 --> 29:08.347
It's not much...

29:08.382 --> 29:10.416
This is wonderful, thank you.

29:10.451 --> 29:13.018
And please, pass along
my thanks to everyone.

29:13.054 --> 29:15.087
I would do it myself, but...

29:15.122 --> 29:18.057
Oh no, no, they... they understand.

29:18.092 --> 29:19.325
We all miss you.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.094
And, uh, please, if there's
anything else that you need...

29:22.129 --> 29:24.029
I will not hesitate to ask.

29:24.065 --> 29:26.131
Mm. Just making sure.

29:26.167 --> 29:28.000
Thank you.

29:29.036 --> 29:30.102
Good night.

29:30.137 --> 29:31.303
Good night.

29:48.122 --> 29:49.321
Who was that?

29:49.357 --> 29:52.358
Oh, it was just someone from church.

29:52.393 --> 29:54.159
Hi, bug.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.999
Here.

30:03.170 --> 30:06.238
I, uh... wasn't sure how you take it,

30:06.273 --> 30:09.308
I... guessed black.

30:22.056 --> 30:24.490
You're gonna have to promise me
you'll come over every Sunday.

30:24.525 --> 30:26.258
Stop.

30:27.361 --> 30:28.494
I'm serious.

30:30.097 --> 30:33.465
Come on, you put the fun
back in family dinner.

30:33.501 --> 30:39.037
Well, if you... add a "u"
and switch some letters around.

30:40.074 --> 30:41.473
How could I have been so stupid?

30:44.078 --> 30:47.279
Don't... Don't beat yourself up.

30:47.314 --> 30:51.283
No... tonight was important.

30:51.318 --> 30:54.219
This dinner was supposed to be special.

30:54.255 --> 30:57.222
And, there will be other dinners.

30:57.258 --> 30:59.158
Unfortunately.

31:00.361 --> 31:02.227
I should've just been myself.

31:04.298 --> 31:05.431
Yeah, I get it.

31:07.435 --> 31:10.532
I spent the better part
of 12 years trying to be

31:10.532 --> 31:14.106
the son I thought my mom and
dad wanted me to be.

31:14.141 --> 31:19.244
And I just lived a lie
for so long that I...

31:19.280 --> 31:21.313
lost sight of who I was.

31:22.516 --> 31:25.350
Or... who I wanted to be.

31:27.488 --> 31:29.121
So who do you wanna be?

31:30.257 --> 31:32.224
Um...

31:33.527 --> 31:35.427
it's a work in progress.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.033
You don't drink coffee, do you?

31:42.336 --> 31:44.269
No, sorry.

31:44.305 --> 31:45.471
Yeah.

31:49.076 --> 31:52.211
Next, you're gonna tell me
you don't sell pharmaceuticals.

31:58.352 --> 32:01.286
I don't know, I mean,
I'll admit she's a little odd.

32:01.322 --> 32:04.223
Well, uh, you're being
very generous. Here.

32:04.258 --> 32:06.358
I think you're being too hard on her.

32:06.393 --> 32:10.329
That little girl can't be more than
90 pounds soaking wet,

32:10.364 --> 32:13.365
and she downed a bottle
and a half of wine, nerves...

32:13.400 --> 32:17.002
And that's another thing...
Who brings one, let alone two,

32:17.037 --> 32:19.204
$800 bottles of wine?

32:19.240 --> 32:21.240
Someone who's trying to make
a great first impression.

32:21.275 --> 32:25.210
Yeah. And, did you see Holden's face
when we brought up the hospital?

32:25.246 --> 32:27.112
He looked like he'd seen a ghost.

32:28.382 --> 32:30.115
You know, he's sleepwalking again.

32:30.150 --> 32:32.050
I can hear him in the morning.

32:32.086 --> 32:35.187
I can see it in his eyes, this anxiety.

32:35.222 --> 32:38.257
Like he's carrying around
this invisible weight.

32:38.292 --> 32:42.427
Maybe Agent Borden is right. Maybe
there is something wrong with him.

32:42.463 --> 32:44.296
There's nothing wrong with him.

32:44.331 --> 32:47.232
Don't let that crackpot
Borden get into your head.

32:47.268 --> 32:49.101
We're in the dark, Tom.

32:49.136 --> 32:51.370
With Holden, his coma,

32:51.405 --> 32:53.171
this Willa girl?

32:53.207 --> 32:56.308
There's something strange
going on, and it makes me sick

32:56.343 --> 32:59.144
to think that we're not
doing enough to help him.

32:59.179 --> 33:00.412
I think we're doing everything
we know how.

33:00.447 --> 33:05.017
Personally, I think this
Pastor Ian plan is risky.

33:05.052 --> 33:08.186
If we wanna protect Holden,
it's a risk we have to take.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.490
Is this it?

33:51.525 --> 33:52.558
See for yourself.

34:00.635 --> 34:02.301
Did you look at it?

34:03.704 --> 34:05.337
Of course I looked at it.

34:05.373 --> 34:07.473
Self-control is not one of my virtues.

34:07.508 --> 34:09.775
Self-preservation, on the other hand...

34:13.380 --> 34:15.481
The girl in the file?

34:15.516 --> 34:16.681
She's your daughter.

34:16.717 --> 34:17.783
Isn't she?

34:19.820 --> 34:22.588
Is she... special?

34:22.623 --> 34:26.425
All children are special.
Especially if they're yours.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.360
But she's not yours?

34:29.664 --> 34:31.362
Is she?

34:34.768 --> 34:36.467
Okay.

34:39.806 --> 34:41.507
What are those?

34:41.542 --> 34:44.342
You're obviously not a Tic Tac man.

34:44.378 --> 34:45.444
Where'd you get 'em?

34:45.478 --> 34:47.746
Shoemacher's secret stash.

34:47.782 --> 34:50.616
I... I was hoping they'd be
good for a joyride,

34:50.650 --> 34:55.587
but then I Googled the script and...
well, I could think of more fun ways

34:55.623 --> 34:57.456
to be throwing up all weekend.

34:58.526 --> 34:59.692
They're chemo pills?

34:59.727 --> 35:02.361
Yeah, Shoemacher's chemo pills.

35:04.632 --> 35:07.333
I take it you didn't know either?

35:14.775 --> 35:20.546
If she's got cancer... why not
just let nature take its course?

35:20.581 --> 35:24.783
Why go through all the trouble
to get revenge on someone

35:24.819 --> 35:26.785
whose time is already running out?

35:28.489 --> 35:31.390
Don't forget why you agreed to help me.

35:31.425 --> 35:32.725
Yeah, you threatened Anabelle.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.727
I offered you Arthur's location.

35:39.767 --> 35:42.801
Arthur's an old man. You could let
nature take its course,

35:42.837 --> 35:44.737
but I know you're not gonna do that.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.606
Because I know how satisfying it is

35:47.641 --> 35:50.576
to look down the barrel of a gun
at someone who's wronged you,

35:50.611 --> 35:53.612
right before you pull the trigger.

35:53.647 --> 35:55.614
And I know you know it, too.

35:59.453 --> 36:01.286
You and I, we're a lot alike.

36:02.656 --> 36:05.424
We do what we have to do
to protect the ones we love.

36:05.459 --> 36:08.660
We do it 'cause no one else will.

36:08.696 --> 36:13.332
And we do it 'cause sometimes
nature takes too damn long.

38:16.724 --> 38:18.390
Holden!

39:12.513 --> 39:15.314
Edgar...

39:15.349 --> 39:19.685
can you tell me in your own
words...what happened?

39:21.522 --> 39:25.457
Could've been a faulty heater. Maybe a
spark caught the window curtain.

39:25.492 --> 39:27.392
Edgar?

39:29.396 --> 39:31.496
Edgar, we're gonna need you
to cooperate.

39:31.532 --> 39:34.333
And we'd rather you do so voluntarily.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.574
Good.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.710
That's good.

39:44.745 --> 39:49.648
Now, again, can you tell me,
in your own words,

39:49.683 --> 39:50.782
what happened?

39:50.818 --> 39:53.585
Did you start that fire?

39:54.655 --> 39:56.755
I can't remember.

39:59.526 --> 40:00.759
Okay...

40:00.794 --> 40:04.630
well, why don't you start by telling
me what you do remember?

40:05.666 --> 40:11.503
I... I r... uh... I r...

40:11.538 --> 40:14.406
I remember the... the window.

40:16.844 --> 40:19.444
I remember the window.

40:21.448 --> 40:23.348
I could see outside.

40:23.384 --> 40:27.586
The sky. The trees.

40:27.621 --> 40:32.524
All of it devoured by flame.

40:32.559 --> 40:34.726
Red, and...

40:36.630 --> 40:41.400
smoldering. Clouds turned to
ash and then crumbled,

40:41.435 --> 40:43.368
nothing survived.

40:44.672 --> 40:47.539
Something... horrible...

40:48.609 --> 40:50.475
came here and did this.

40:52.546 --> 40:54.680
Okay, Edgar, I'm gonna switch
gears here for a minute.

40:54.715 --> 40:59.418
I need you to talk to me
about Holden Matthews.

41:00.587 --> 41:02.754
You said you needed to see him.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.356
Is he here?

41:04.391 --> 41:06.725
No. No, Edgar, he's not here.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.460
Who is he?

41:10.698 --> 41:16.468
Edgar... why do you need
to see Holden Matthews?

41:23.577 --> 41:28.547
Because... they're coming.
