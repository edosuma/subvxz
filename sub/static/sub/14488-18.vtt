(GROWLING IN FRUSTRATION)

11:51.003 --> 11:52.004
Greetings, Francis.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.465
Sorry if I was
a little hostile before,

11:54.548 --> 11:56.383
but snipping
is the only reason

11:56.467 --> 11:58.469
I'm even tolerated
around here.

11:58.719 --> 12:02.640
Not like you, with those
magnificent squeezers.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.601
Squeezers? Squeezers!

12:05.726 --> 12:07.019
They're clamps,
you (BLEEP)!

12:07.186 --> 12:09.605
And if I want to (BLEEP)-ing
snip with these clamps,

12:09.688 --> 12:12.107
I will snip with
these (BLEEP)-ing clamps!

12:12.316 --> 12:13.400
Why do you think
they call me...

12:13.484 --> 12:14.526
(GAGGING)

12:15.027 --> 12:16.403
Francis?

12:16.487 --> 12:19.323
Francis, I have
good news!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.742
It's time for
your first delivery.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.369
To the Moon!

12:23.702 --> 12:25.663
Fan-(BLEEP)-ing-tastic!

12:42.513 --> 12:45.015
Here's the 200 feet of rope
you ordered, Sheriff Furley.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.100
Hot diggitv!

12:46.183 --> 12:49.019
You fellers want to stick around
for the hanging tomorrow?

12:49.144 --> 12:50.354
It's gonna be a doozy.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.438
(GRUNTING)

12:51.814 --> 12:54.400
I sure do love
hanging people.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.819
Well, I best start
cutting the nooses.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.737
Oh! You know who
could help with that?

12:59.863 --> 13:00.906
Francis!

13:00.990 --> 13:02.116
(LAUGHS)

13:06.036 --> 13:08.038
Nice job, Francis.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.582
I like how you didn't get drunk
and steal anyone's organs,

13:10.666 --> 13:11.625
like our old robot.

13:11.709 --> 13:12.751
Bender?

13:16.755 --> 13:18.716
Bender, it's me, Fry!

13:19.216 --> 13:20.217
Heeyah!

13:32.730 --> 13:35.524
<i>I knew Bender would turn up
purely by coincidence.</i>

13:35.733 --> 13:38.068
<i>Take care of him,
but do it quietly.</i>

13:38.152 --> 13:41.989
Don't worry. We're in space,
where no one can hear you clamp.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.074
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

13:44.158 --> 13:45.159
What do you know?

13:45.242 --> 13:47.953
The Feds gave Bender a new
identity as a Moon farmer.

13:48.037 --> 13:49.830
He must be afraid
to break character,

13:49.913 --> 13:52.374
in case there's any Robot
Mafia scuzzballs around.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.709
FRANCIS: Heh?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.918
Come on,
let's go check on him.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.088
I checked on a guy once.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.257
I checked him
into tiny pieces!

14:01.175 --> 14:04.636
Bender? Nope, don't recollect
nobody by that name.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.598
But let me ask
my son-in-law, Billy?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.350
Yes, Moon-Pa?

14:09.683 --> 14:13.979
These nice big-city hillbillies are
looking for someone named Bender.

14:14.063 --> 14:15.064
You know him?

14:15.147 --> 14:18.400
Nope. He ain't any of the
eight people I ever met.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.194
Bender, it's us,
your friends.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.613
You can drop
the hillbilly moron act.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.948
Sorry, mister,
but I'm no Bender.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.909
I'm just a simple farmer.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.619
Name's Billy West.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.621
(LAUGHS) Billy West?

14:30.746 --> 14:32.831
What a stupid,
phony, made-up name.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.917
You city folk
are probably hungry

14:35.000 --> 14:37.628
from premarital sex
and flag-burning.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.380
Y'all wanna stay
for supper?

14:39.463 --> 14:43.217
Well, my boyfriend and I were going
to have sex on a burning flag,

14:43.300 --> 14:44.885
but I could have a bite.

14:47.054 --> 14:51.600
May I present my beautiful
robot wife, the Crushinator.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.186
She's serving up
the dinner and the charm.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.188
Mashed chicken,
Mr. Fry?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.314
Sure.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.613
So, Billy,
where were you born?

15:04.780 --> 15:06.740
Right here
in Moon country.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.867
And how long have you
been a farmer?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.120
Reckon I was born a farmer.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.580
Folks say my mama
was a hoe.

15:13.872 --> 15:17.584
Oh, dear, I seem to
have warped my fork.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.878
Could you bend it
back for me, Billy?

15:20.504 --> 15:22.714
Bend it?
I can't even lift it.

15:22.798 --> 15:26.593
Which is weird, seeing as how
my daddy was a forklift.

15:26.969 --> 15:31.098
Wow. Bender is really committed
to his new Jethrovian identity.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.475
If y'all are finished,

15:33.559 --> 15:36.728
I'll drive y'all back to
town in the old clunker.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.984
So, y'all flew here
in a spacey ship?

15:42.109 --> 15:44.445
Stop talking like that!
You live on the Moon!

15:44.653 --> 15:47.906
If that is Bender, I guess he's
just happier in his new life.

15:48.157 --> 15:50.701
I refuse to believe
anyone is happy!

15:50.826 --> 15:54.455
Mr. West, would you mind
if I examined your brain?

15:54.538 --> 15:58.208
Examine? Heck, if you can
find it, you can keep it.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.212
(SQUAWKING)

16:03.964 --> 16:09.303
Gadzooks! Bender's hard drive no longer
contains any of his old memories!

16:09.511 --> 16:14.099
When the Feds bumpkinized him, they
completely wiped out his old identity!

16:14.183 --> 16:15.184
(ALL GASP)

16:15.267 --> 16:16.977
Well, I don't know
about that,

16:17.060 --> 16:20.564
but who am I to argue
with a man from the sky?

16:20.898 --> 16:22.774
So long, space heroes.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.948
You sure you don't
want to kill all humans?

16:30.032 --> 16:32.159
(SCOFFS) I love all humans.

(SNIFFS)

16:34.036 --> 16:35.704
He really is gone.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.337
I guess I'm happy for him.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.257
And honestly, Francis is a way
better friend than Bender ever was.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.384
Hey, where is Francis?

Make it two.
I'm greedy.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.148
You got the rest fooled,
but not me.

17:04.525 --> 17:08.028
Now let's take this outside,
so's no one else gets clamped.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.280
You're the boss, stranger.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.954
I'm gonna clamp your body
parts off one by one.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.415
But then I'm gonna clamp your
wounds shut so you stay alive

17:20.499 --> 17:22.209
while I clamp you some more!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.294

Okay. God bless Grandma
and Grandpa...

gonna cut your damn head off!
