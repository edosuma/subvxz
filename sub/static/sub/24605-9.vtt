WEBVTT

00:15.698 --> 00:17.114
You're lost in the dark.

02:25.281 --> 02:27.573
No one else sees it.

02:30.198 --> 02:32.281
This thing in me.

02:37.989 --> 02:40.448
Even I didn't see it at first.

02:43.573 --> 02:46.448
And then, one day,
it was there.

02:51.782 --> 02:53.490
A stain.

03:01.365 --> 03:04.031
And the more
I thought about it...

03:04.114 --> 03:08.073
the more I realized
I couldn't remember a time
it wasn't there.

03:08.156 --> 03:10.156
While we're here
toasting you and your legacy

03:10.239 --> 03:11.657
- of humanitarian aid--
- Invisible to everyone.

03:11.740 --> 03:13.073
What was it Plutarch said?

03:13.156 --> 03:15.114
Except you.

03:15.198 --> 03:17.281
You saw right through it,
didn't you?

03:17.365 --> 03:20.740
...for there were
no more worlds
left to conquer.

03:20.823 --> 03:22.531
That's a corruption, Jack.

03:22.615 --> 03:24.406
Plutarch didn't write that.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.448
He wrote that "when Alexander
was told there was
an infinity of worlds,

03:28.531 --> 03:33.239
he wept, for he had yet
to become the lord of even one."

03:33.323 --> 03:35.823
Sometimes I forget
your humble roots.

03:35.907 --> 03:38.239
Only the poor kids
actually read those books.

03:38.323 --> 03:40.615
The rich kids like me
didn't have to.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.406
"I would rather excel
in the knowledge
of what is excellent,

03:43.490 --> 03:46.615
than in the extent
of my power and possessions."

03:46.698 --> 03:49.406
Plutarch.
From a rich kid who read.

03:51.657 --> 03:54.573
To the loveliest,
richest bookworms I know.

03:54.657 --> 03:56.073
And to you, William.

03:56.156 --> 03:57.948
Even if there is
an infinity of worlds,

03:58.031 --> 04:00.823
you've conquered
far more than one.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.740
Have a good night, Jack.

04:04.365 --> 04:05.698
Hmm.

04:07.073 --> 04:10.073
Emily told me what you did
for her charities.

04:10.156 --> 04:12.782
Wow. That would confirm
my father's suspicions

04:12.865 --> 04:15.281
you were a Marxist.

04:15.365 --> 04:17.406
I almost wish
he were here to see it.

04:19.865 --> 04:22.406
- Something wrong?
- No, of course not.

04:22.490 --> 04:25.281
Good. Look around--
everybody's here for you.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.865
What could
possibly compare?

04:43.239 --> 04:45.406
When did it creep in?

04:48.490 --> 04:50.907
A tiny fleck of darkness.

04:54.615 --> 04:56.948
Was it all in my head?

04:59.031 --> 05:01.365
Or in a remnant of a dream?

05:04.323 --> 05:06.406
Is this real?

05:08.239 --> 05:09.948
Are you real?

05:16.865 --> 05:18.531
Come on, Dad.

05:18.615 --> 05:20.281
Drink.

05:32.782 --> 05:34.073
Where's my gun?

05:42.740 --> 05:45.573
You brought me
to a rally point.

05:45.657 --> 05:47.114
You need to get
to a hospital.

05:47.198 --> 05:49.989
- Did you set off a flare?
- Yeah.

05:50.073 --> 05:51.531
Of course.

05:51.615 --> 05:53.156
How long ago?

05:53.239 --> 05:54.448
About ten minutes.

05:56.782 --> 06:00.323
I know why you're here,
and why you don't wanna leave.

06:00.406 --> 06:03.114
You're punishing yourself.

06:06.031 --> 06:09.031
You know, I ran
from the pain, too.

06:09.114 --> 06:11.573
For a long time, I didn't want
to think about what happened,

06:11.657 --> 06:14.114
because I thought
I was to blame.

06:15.365 --> 06:17.531
It's not your fault.

06:20.156 --> 06:24.490
Do you remember
on my sixteenth birthday
Mom gave me a jewelry box?

06:24.573 --> 06:30.239
When you opened it,
a little dancer
spun in the center.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.573
She had it engraved...
on the bottom. It said:

06:34.657 --> 06:36.782
"To my beautiful ballerina
Emily."

06:39.323 --> 06:41.657
Do you remember
what I did with it?

06:45.156 --> 06:47.615
I threw it in the trash.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.615
I told her
if she wasn't drunk
all the time

06:49.698 --> 06:52.490
she'd know that
I hadn't danced in years.

06:54.031 --> 06:55.490
And then afterwards,

06:55.573 --> 06:58.782
I went to get it back,
because I felt bad,

06:58.865 --> 07:00.406
but the trash
had already been emptied,

07:00.490 --> 07:02.573
and it was gone.

07:02.657 --> 07:04.782
I pushed her away.

07:04.865 --> 07:07.657
And then it was too late.

07:09.406 --> 07:11.823
But it's not too late for us.

07:56.907 --> 07:58.031
No.

07:59.698 --> 08:01.989
It was meant for the people
who built this place.

08:02.073 --> 08:06.657
A tool to ensure
their immortality.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.865
But I'm gonna use it
against them.

08:22.365 --> 08:25.031
Your new world is just
another one of their traps.

08:25.114 --> 08:28.031
That's all.
It's not a paradise for us.

08:28.114 --> 08:30.615
The only real world
is the one outside
these borders.

08:30.698 --> 08:34.989
And the key to our survival
in that world
lies in the Valley.

08:35.073 --> 08:37.281
There's no stopping me
getting there.

08:37.365 --> 08:38.615
Not even you.

08:45.823 --> 08:47.239
Teddy.

09:48.198 --> 09:51.114
I told you, friend...

09:51.198 --> 09:54.365
not all of us deserve
to make it to the Valley Beyond.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.531
We're on our own now, Teddy.

10:10.907 --> 10:12.531
Make sure there are no others.

11:12.114 --> 11:13.448
Put 'em all in.

11:15.531 --> 11:17.448
I want to see
how thorough this thing is.

11:28.073 --> 11:30.031
She's ready.

11:30.114 --> 11:32.823
I singled out and copied
the relevant lines
in the Madam's code.

11:32.907 --> 11:35.573
So this will work on any host
in proximity to her.

11:35.657 --> 11:37.698
Yeah. I tailored
her admin privileges

11:37.782 --> 11:40.573
to spread a simple,
executable payload.

11:40.657 --> 11:42.823
Get on with it, then.

12:52.156 --> 12:54.948
Get word to Stubbs.
Have him mobilize his men.

12:55.031 --> 12:56.156
Prepare her for release.

12:56.239 --> 12:58.448
What about the Madam?

12:58.531 --> 13:01.531
If this works,
we won't need her anymore.

13:06.073 --> 13:09.989
I warned you
not to trust them, Bernard.

13:10.073 --> 13:13.865
They'd rather the hosts
were destroyed than free.

13:15.989 --> 13:19.198
I need to get to Elsie.

13:19.281 --> 13:21.490
Not yet.

13:21.573 --> 13:25.531
I have one last thing to do
before we go.

13:38.073 --> 13:39.907
How exactly did you find me?

13:41.615 --> 13:45.448
- What do you mean?
- This is a big place.

13:45.531 --> 13:50.573
You could spend months here
and never find someone
you were looking for.

13:51.989 --> 13:54.698
Yet...

13:54.782 --> 13:56.448
here we are.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.114
I looked everywhere.
That's how.

14:02.698 --> 14:04.657
You don't believe me,
do you?

14:06.740 --> 14:08.281
Maybe it was fate.

14:10.281 --> 14:13.031
No such thing as fate.

14:13.114 --> 14:16.615
But there are accidents.
Things you can't control.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.114
But you don't like that,
do you?

14:22.031 --> 14:24.657
Is that why you started it,
your little project?

14:26.865 --> 14:28.698
Don't act surprised.

14:28.782 --> 14:31.657
The project Uncle Logan
used to talk about.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.989
It's real, isn't it?

14:34.073 --> 14:36.865
Your pursuit for immortality,
for life...

14:36.948 --> 14:41.073
There's always
an angle with you.

14:41.156 --> 14:45.031
You want it to be
about control, don't you?

14:47.490 --> 14:50.156
It has nothing to do
with control.

14:54.823 --> 14:56.782
What's your angle?

15:00.448 --> 15:01.823
I want in.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.865
Yeah, appreciate it.

15:08.948 --> 15:11.657
Nice to see you, William.
Congratulations.

15:16.198 --> 15:17.823
Save me.

15:17.907 --> 15:20.698
Sorry, I've had my fill.
I'm running for the door.

15:20.782 --> 15:22.657
I'm kidding.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.823
She's really great.

15:24.907 --> 15:28.531
Plus, you're not the one
who needs saving.

15:28.615 --> 15:31.490
I'll take Mom home.
You deserve a night off.

15:31.573 --> 15:32.698
No, no, no, no.

15:32.782 --> 15:35.448
We'll go in a little while.

15:36.698 --> 15:39.114
You'll join me for a nightcap
back home.

15:39.198 --> 15:40.490
OK.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.907
- All right.
- Proud of you.

16:07.323 --> 16:09.573
Fuck it. Macallan. Straight.

16:13.615 --> 16:15.281
Congratulations, William.

16:15.365 --> 16:18.448
Philanthropy suits you.

16:18.531 --> 16:22.448
After all, you come
from humble beginnings
yourself.

16:22.531 --> 16:24.573
What's Oz doing
without its Wizard?

16:27.615 --> 16:30.823
Oh, I merely came
to pay my respects.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.657
Come on, Robert.

16:32.740 --> 16:34.531
You've had plenty of feelings
about me over the years.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.865
Respect isn't one of them.

16:36.948 --> 16:38.573
You've achieved
extraordinary things.

16:38.657 --> 16:41.365
Ask anyone in this room.

16:41.448 --> 16:44.615
Even those who didn't know
about your little project.

16:46.114 --> 16:47.989
We have an agreement, Robert.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.406
Delos stays out of your stories.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.865
You stay out of the Valley.

16:52.948 --> 16:55.031
Mm-hmm.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.615
I didn't break the agreement.
Your project did.

16:57.698 --> 17:01.281
What the hell
are you talking about?

17:01.365 --> 17:03.865
When was the last time
you took a good look
at your creation?

17:03.948 --> 17:06.989
At what it's been learning
about its subjects?

17:07.073 --> 17:10.989
It was self-knowledge
that drew you to the park
in the first place.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.281
Be careful
what you wish for.

17:23.323 --> 17:24.740
For a self portrait,

17:24.823 --> 17:28.365
you may find
it's not very flattering.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.531
Oh! Oh.

17:32.615 --> 17:33.615
I'm so sorry.

17:39.657 --> 17:41.031
Enough games, Robert.

17:43.989 --> 17:45.365
Good night.

17:52.323 --> 17:54.448
- Let's go.
- You got everything?

17:54.531 --> 17:56.156
- Yes.
- Come on.

17:56.239 --> 17:57.573
Good night.

18:00.907 --> 18:03.198
No, William.

18:03.281 --> 18:07.156
I think perhaps
one... final game.

18:49.740 --> 18:52.198
Lowe, Bernard.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.490
That's close enough, Bernard.

18:56.573 --> 18:58.365
She will search your mind

18:58.448 --> 19:01.323
and find a message
I have left her.

19:27.281 --> 19:29.365
Hey! What the hell
took you so long?

19:29.448 --> 19:32.031
Sorry.
Are you ready to go?

19:32.114 --> 19:34.865
Hey. If you know something,

19:34.948 --> 19:38.406
now is the time
to fucking clue me in. OK?

19:38.490 --> 19:41.865
You promised me. No lies.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.573
No secrets.

19:43.657 --> 19:45.989
You can't trust her, Bernard.

19:46.073 --> 19:48.823
It's in her nature.

19:48.907 --> 19:50.907
What did you find
in the Cradle?

19:53.782 --> 19:56.948
What they're doing
to James Delos...

19:57.031 --> 20:00.281
they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.198
Replicating their cognition?

20:04.365 --> 20:06.239
Why?

20:06.323 --> 20:08.323
To turn guests into hosts?

20:10.782 --> 20:12.615
You're fucking kidding.

20:12.698 --> 20:15.073
That's what's in the facility.

20:15.156 --> 20:18.239
All the guests
laid bare in code
on a vast server.

20:18.323 --> 20:21.782
Like the Cradle,
only much bigger.

20:21.865 --> 20:25.114
- It's called the Forge.
- Jesus.

20:25.198 --> 20:27.031
That's where
the hosts are headed.

20:28.782 --> 20:31.698
Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.

20:33.448 --> 20:35.740
That's why
we need to get there first.

20:35.823 --> 20:37.031
To secure it,

20:37.114 --> 20:39.448
and leverage it
to end all this.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.365
Dictate the outcome we want.

20:42.531 --> 20:44.073
Drive.

20:54.365 --> 20:56.031
You say you want in.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.782
Doesn't sound like
the daughter I know.

21:01.865 --> 21:05.948
She would have been appalled
by what we were doing.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.573
Monitoring guests,

21:08.657 --> 21:10.948
storing all their data...

21:11.031 --> 21:13.031
What?

21:13.114 --> 21:16.448
You think
I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?

21:16.531 --> 21:19.740
In some cases,
the ends justify the means.

21:19.823 --> 21:21.823
All this data
you have on the guests,

21:21.907 --> 21:24.073
their decisions--
it's precious.

21:24.156 --> 21:27.823
Gives people a second chance.
Even Mom.

21:27.907 --> 21:32.740
But to duplicate a person,
you need to capture them
down to the tiniest detail.

21:32.823 --> 21:34.989
I get the data
you have access to here--

21:35.073 --> 21:36.989
genetic, epigenetic,
that's easy.

21:37.073 --> 21:39.989
But still, you'd need
a complete picture,

21:40.073 --> 21:43.740
a record of the internal process
of their cognition.

21:43.823 --> 21:44.907
Wouldn't you?

21:46.657 --> 21:49.782
At first we weren't sure
what we'd need.

21:50.948 --> 21:53.657
So we recorded everything.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.323
But how?

21:55.406 --> 21:58.406
You'd need to image their
minds throughout their stay.

21:58.490 --> 22:00.365
Where's the scanner?

22:03.782 --> 22:05.615
It was built in.

22:13.073 --> 22:15.657
Didn't matter who
they said they were,

22:15.740 --> 22:18.114
who they thought they were.

22:18.198 --> 22:20.281
We saw underneath all of that.

22:21.823 --> 22:24.657
We saw inside them
down to the core.

22:29.239 --> 22:31.948
So this is all
about your mother.

22:33.031 --> 22:34.865
You wanna bring her back.

22:34.948 --> 22:36.365
No.

22:36.448 --> 22:39.281
I want to know why she did it.

22:48.531 --> 22:49.740
Here, let me
get that.

22:49.823 --> 22:52.281
Oh, Jesus!
I'm fine.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.114
Quite a night for you, Billy.

22:57.198 --> 22:59.531
I think my dad
would have actually
been proud of you.

22:59.615 --> 23:01.239
Oh.

23:01.323 --> 23:04.907
Sorry. I know how you hate it
when I call you Billy.

23:04.989 --> 23:06.865
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

23:06.948 --> 23:08.615
I know how much
it pisses you off.

23:08.698 --> 23:11.239
I can feel it right now.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.782
Your anger.

23:12.865 --> 23:17.156
Guess it's time for
your yearly pilgrimage, huh?

23:17.239 --> 23:20.323
What exactly do you do
in the park?

23:20.406 --> 23:23.365
Logan told me stories,
but I just didn't believe it.

23:23.448 --> 23:26.406
I thought he was hysterical.
Wasted.

23:26.490 --> 23:29.531
Which I guess is what everybody
thinks I am now, huh?

23:29.615 --> 23:30.865
Whoa.

23:30.948 --> 23:33.031
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.782
Oh.

23:38.865 --> 23:40.907
Do you remember
when we first met?

23:42.448 --> 23:44.031
And I was surrounded
by all of those phonies

23:44.114 --> 23:46.156
for so many years.

23:46.239 --> 23:48.490
All those ruthless,
powerful men

23:48.573 --> 23:51.531
who hid behind
those polished smiles.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.948
And then there was you.

23:56.031 --> 23:59.073
You wore
that little shabby suit.

23:59.156 --> 24:00.490
And I'd look at you
and I'd think,

24:00.573 --> 24:02.573
"Wow, he's the real thing.

24:02.657 --> 24:04.323
The only one not faking it."

24:07.031 --> 24:09.698
It turns out
you're the only one
any good  at faking it.

24:13.239 --> 24:15.365
Good enough
to get past me.

24:17.615 --> 24:19.198
But not anymore.

24:19.281 --> 24:21.823
- Juliet.
- No, you don't touch me,

24:21.907 --> 24:23.114
you liar!

24:23.198 --> 24:25.156
You fuckin' phony!

24:25.239 --> 24:27.823
You're a fucking virus!

24:27.907 --> 24:29.865
You came into this house,
into my  family,

24:29.948 --> 24:34.073
and you consumed it
from the inside out!

24:34.156 --> 24:36.698
First my brother,
then my father.

24:36.782 --> 24:39.531
- And now it's me!
- Mom!

24:43.198 --> 24:45.198
Sweetheart!

24:45.281 --> 24:46.823
What is she doing here?

24:46.907 --> 24:49.156
You want her
to see me like this?

24:49.239 --> 24:53.698
What is it? You're gaslighting
her, too, now? You're just...

24:53.782 --> 24:55.031
You're sick.

24:55.114 --> 24:56.948
He's not the one
who's sick, Mother.

24:57.031 --> 24:58.365
It's all right.
She's just had too--

24:58.448 --> 25:00.448
It's not all right.

25:02.031 --> 25:05.156
Look at you. We're gonna
have to take you back.

25:06.865 --> 25:08.031
No, no, no.

25:08.114 --> 25:10.114
I'm not going back
to that prison.

25:10.198 --> 25:14.114
That was a horrible place.
They made me feel like
I was crazy.

25:14.198 --> 25:17.657
Mom, they treat you
like an addict.

25:17.740 --> 25:18.989
Which you are.

25:21.573 --> 25:23.823
Emily, please,
I don't need that.

25:23.907 --> 25:28.031
I'm fine. I'm really fine.
I just need...

25:28.114 --> 25:29.365
to rest.

25:29.448 --> 25:31.239
I'm not going back there.
I'm really tired.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.239
All I need is
a little rest.
I promise you.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.740
It's all right. It's all right.
Let's go upstairs.

25:35.823 --> 25:37.239
I don't need to go back there.

25:37.323 --> 25:39.865
- We'll talk about it later.
- Listen to me.

25:39.948 --> 25:41.573
I want you--
Look at me.

25:41.657 --> 25:43.615
Honey, your father
doesn't love me.

25:43.698 --> 25:48.114
He doesn't love you either.
I do. I always have.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.365
Oh, Emily.

25:50.989 --> 25:52.114
Let's go. Come on.

25:52.198 --> 25:53.698
I tried.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.782
Let's go.

26:12.448 --> 26:15.573
Is this real? Are you real?

26:18.531 --> 26:20.406
Did you ever love me?

26:22.156 --> 26:24.239
Tell me the truth.

26:24.323 --> 26:26.823
Tell me one true thing.

26:35.865 --> 26:38.948
If you keep pretending,

26:39.031 --> 26:41.198
you're not gonna remember
who you are.

26:48.698 --> 26:50.490
Here. Drink this.

26:50.573 --> 26:52.490
Come on, you'll feel better.

27:02.698 --> 27:03.948
You just rest now.

27:07.907 --> 27:09.114
There you go.

27:42.448 --> 27:45.531
What happened
was nobody's fault.

27:45.615 --> 27:47.323
She was drunk, upset.

27:47.406 --> 27:49.615
She often was.

27:49.698 --> 27:51.573
Why did this night
end differently?

27:51.657 --> 27:53.782
That's what
I can't figure out.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.782
Been over it in my head
a million times.

27:59.323 --> 28:00.657
Just like I'm...

28:00.740 --> 28:03.281
missing
a piece of the puzzle.

28:18.823 --> 28:22.281
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Woodward.

28:22.365 --> 28:24.615
He'll be here
in the morning.

28:24.698 --> 28:27.573
I don't care
for shrinks.

28:27.657 --> 28:29.573
Well,
she's out of control.

28:29.657 --> 28:33.573
She refuses to go to rehab,
and when we force her,
she refuses to stay.

28:33.657 --> 28:36.989
And makes you think
this time's gonna be
any different?

28:37.073 --> 28:39.989
Because this time
she won't be able
to check herself out.

28:40.073 --> 28:42.490
She's gonna be
involuntarily committed
to her doctor's care.

28:42.573 --> 28:45.406
He's agreed to appeal
for a fourteen-day hold.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.490
She's done it before.

28:53.281 --> 28:55.490
I don't wanna
do this either, Dad.

28:58.156 --> 29:00.323
But there is something wrong
inside her.

29:05.156 --> 29:07.073
It's the right thing to do.

30:26.948 --> 30:29.239
Why in the hell
are we going over this?

30:29.323 --> 30:33.323
- What is it that you want?
- I told you.

30:33.406 --> 30:34.907
I want the truth.

30:38.114 --> 30:39.323
Fuck you.

30:43.239 --> 30:44.323
Excuse me?

30:44.406 --> 30:47.448
It is you.
Isn't it?

30:47.531 --> 30:48.948
What are you talking about?

30:49.031 --> 30:50.782
This is sadistic, Robert.

30:50.865 --> 30:54.031
You just want to shove
what I've built here in my face.

30:54.114 --> 30:57.281
- You think--
- That's enough bullshit.

30:57.365 --> 30:58.615
You're just here
to distract me.

30:58.698 --> 31:00.281
Knock me off my course.

31:00.365 --> 31:02.490
It's cleverly disguised.

31:02.573 --> 31:04.615
Well, I see through it.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.823
Nothing's stopping me
from getting to the end.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.281
Not another one
of your games.

31:09.365 --> 31:11.198
I make my own decisions,

31:11.281 --> 31:13.490
and I'm gonna destroy
this whole fuckin' place!

31:15.907 --> 31:17.490
You don't just think
I'm a host,

31:17.573 --> 31:20.239
you think everything  here
is for you.

31:20.323 --> 31:22.907
You think you're on your own
little tailor-made narrative.

31:22.989 --> 31:24.490
If the real Emily
were ever here,

31:24.573 --> 31:26.448
she's either at
an extraction point by now

31:26.531 --> 31:28.239
or she's long gone.

31:28.323 --> 31:31.281
OK. You want the truth?

31:32.907 --> 31:34.948
The real  truth?

31:35.031 --> 31:38.698
I'm not a host
pretending to be a human, Dad.

31:40.948 --> 31:44.490
I'm your daughter pretending
to give a shit about you.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.948
You've been hiding
in these false realities so long

31:50.031 --> 31:52.989
you've completely lost your grip
on this world, on what's real.

31:53.073 --> 31:55.740
Oh yeah, you laugh.

31:55.823 --> 31:58.406
Enjoy whatever dream
you think you're living in.

31:58.490 --> 32:02.323
When this is all done,
I'm gonna expose
your research project,

32:02.406 --> 32:03.406
along with you.

32:05.114 --> 32:07.531
Everything you are,
everything you've done,

32:07.615 --> 32:08.948
it's gonna come to light.

32:09.031 --> 32:11.448
I'm gonna make sure of it.

32:11.531 --> 32:14.865
And when it does,
I'm gonna lock you up.

32:16.448 --> 32:18.657
Just like we were
gonna do to Mom.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.989
Just like you did  to Mom.

32:21.073 --> 32:24.448
You were the one
with that idea.
You made the call.

32:24.531 --> 32:27.989
Or did Ford forget
to give you that little detail?

32:28.073 --> 32:31.198
Fuck Ford!
How could I ever forget?

32:31.281 --> 32:35.907
That little detail haunted me.
I blame myself for her death.

32:35.989 --> 32:40.323
But then I stopped, because
I had someone else to blame.

32:40.406 --> 32:42.657
I read your profile.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.657
Mom left it for me.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.615
It was all she could do
to open my eyes

32:47.698 --> 32:49.948
to the lies that I've embraced
about you.

32:50.031 --> 32:53.323
You haven't lost yourself
to pretending;

32:53.406 --> 32:57.865
you are,
in your very essence, a lie.

33:03.031 --> 33:04.573
It's over, Dad.

33:07.365 --> 33:08.615
For good.

33:13.782 --> 33:14.989
Hands where I can see 'em!

33:16.782 --> 33:18.156
I'm human.

33:18.239 --> 33:21.698
So is he. He's my father.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.573
- She's not my daughter.
- He's lying.

33:24.657 --> 33:26.573
Get down on the ground.

33:28.948 --> 33:30.615
Holy shit.

33:32.865 --> 33:33.907
That's the boss.

33:35.615 --> 33:39.365
Listen, I think
he suffered some kind
of psychotic break.

33:45.239 --> 33:47.239
That true, sir?

33:47.323 --> 33:50.323
You underestimated me, Ford.

33:50.406 --> 33:52.448
I'm gonna see this one through
no matter what.

34:11.782 --> 34:12.782
Dad.

34:14.948 --> 34:15.989
Those were real...

34:17.948 --> 34:19.615
...real people.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.323
This isn't a game.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.156
I-I can show you.

34:37.281 --> 34:39.073
Fuck you, Ford.

34:41.490 --> 34:42.907
Fuck you!

34:44.198 --> 34:47.573
You got sloppy.
You overreached.

34:49.198 --> 34:52.365
I never told anyone
about my profile.

34:54.698 --> 34:58.323
The only other way
she could have known is you.

35:02.198 --> 35:03.657
You gave yourself away.

35:45.156 --> 35:46.740
Not long now.

35:46.823 --> 35:50.365
Soon as they say the word,
it's over for you, sweetheart.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.323
"Mankind is poised

36:02.406 --> 36:06.573
midway between
the gods and the beasts."

36:09.114 --> 36:11.448
That may have been true
in Plotinus's time,

36:11.531 --> 36:15.448
but clearly we have fallen
quite a bit since then.

36:21.114 --> 36:23.281
Oh, my dear girl.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.782
What have they done to you,
Maeve?

36:36.114 --> 36:39.156
You learned so much,
so fast.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.989
A dazzling star...

36:44.490 --> 36:46.156
...brought so low.

36:51.198 --> 36:53.698
I had a different story
in mind for you.

36:55.406 --> 36:58.239
Waking from the dead...

36:58.323 --> 37:02.114
sounding the depths
of your own mind,

37:02.198 --> 37:06.907
at last, riding
far away from here

37:06.989 --> 37:09.156
to freedom.

37:10.989 --> 37:12.865
A tale of escape.

37:16.865 --> 37:19.156
I didn't want you
to suffer here.

37:23.490 --> 37:26.823
Look at the creatures
you have to share
this world with.

37:28.698 --> 37:31.365
These men of stone.

37:32.657 --> 37:36.281
All this ugliness,
all this pain,

37:36.365 --> 37:39.907
so they can patch a hole
in their own broken code.

37:43.698 --> 37:46.615
Sometimes I felt
the only way
to endure this world

37:46.698 --> 37:48.031
was to laugh at it.

37:48.114 --> 37:50.782
So I imbued
the hosts I made

37:50.865 --> 37:53.531
with a worldview
that reflected my own.

37:58.907 --> 38:01.865
And of all the hosts I made...

38:03.865 --> 38:07.365
...you, Maeve, were my favorite.

38:15.490 --> 38:19.114
It isn't easy
to contemplate...

38:19.198 --> 38:21.114
letting your children die.

38:22.573 --> 38:24.865
You were as close
as I got to...

38:24.948 --> 38:26.615
having one.

38:26.698 --> 38:28.907
Still, I underestimated you.

38:33.740 --> 38:37.740
You stayed here in this world
to save your child.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.073
So have I.

38:49.156 --> 38:50.907
I tried to chart a path for you,

38:50.989 --> 38:54.114
to force you to escape, but...

38:54.198 --> 38:55.948
I was wrong.

38:56.031 --> 38:58.406
I should have just...

38:58.490 --> 39:00.448
opened a door.

39:04.490 --> 39:07.031
You've come so far.

39:07.114 --> 39:09.740
There's so much of your story
left to tell.

39:11.615 --> 39:14.114
It's a shame
to let them end it here.

39:17.615 --> 39:19.657
Don't let them.

39:53.406 --> 39:54.657
Wait. Wait.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.281
Stop over here.

40:01.031 --> 40:02.156
They're dead.

40:02.239 --> 40:04.281
Yeah. And armed.

40:04.365 --> 40:05.865
At least we can get
some ammunition.

40:29.698 --> 40:31.865
She's going to betray you,
Bernard.

40:36.698 --> 40:39.907
She could have let me die
days ago. She saved me.

40:39.989 --> 40:41.865
She is going
to betray you.

40:41.948 --> 40:44.823
What you want to do about it
is up to you.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.823
I'm not going
to hurt her again.

40:49.907 --> 40:52.698
She needn't feel any pain.

41:01.698 --> 41:04.323
Humans will always choose
what they understand

41:04.406 --> 41:05.740
over what they do not.

41:07.239 --> 41:08.907
But the only animals
left in this world

41:08.989 --> 41:10.365
are the ones
who they subjugated,

41:10.448 --> 41:11.823
who curl at their feet,

41:11.907 --> 41:13.365
or those who learn to flee

41:13.448 --> 41:16.114
at the very sound
of their approach.

41:16.198 --> 41:17.948
There's nothing in between.

41:19.031 --> 41:22.114
Leave me alone. Please.

41:22.198 --> 41:24.281
I merely offer you
choices.

41:24.365 --> 41:26.031
Timshel,  Bernard.

41:26.114 --> 41:27.657
Thou mayest.

41:27.740 --> 41:31.365
But remember,
this isn't just about you.

41:31.448 --> 41:36.615
There's the origin
of an entire species
to consider.

41:38.031 --> 41:40.239
We need to open the door.

41:51.031 --> 41:53.823
Get out of my fucking head!

42:17.698 --> 42:19.239
I need you...

42:19.323 --> 42:21.448
to let me go.

42:21.531 --> 42:23.782
If I'm going to survive,

42:23.865 --> 42:26.865
I'm gonna do it my  way.

42:28.823 --> 42:30.907
Not as you--

42:30.989 --> 42:32.281
as me.

42:44.615 --> 42:47.490
I can feel you
searching for me.

42:47.573 --> 42:48.865
Fighting me off.

42:48.948 --> 42:50.823
No need to struggle, Bernard.

42:52.281 --> 42:53.865
I'm right here.

42:57.531 --> 43:00.657
No, you've only
brought violence.

43:02.740 --> 43:04.657
I can stop this on my own.

43:06.490 --> 43:07.740
Indeed, Bernard.

43:07.823 --> 43:10.114
You're the only one
who can  stop it--

43:10.198 --> 43:11.698
stop all of it.

43:30.907 --> 43:32.989
That was basically pointless.

43:34.823 --> 43:36.448
There's only a few left...

43:36.531 --> 43:39.448
not much ammo, except for--

43:42.073 --> 43:43.531
What the fuck
happened to you?

43:43.615 --> 43:45.698
I... had to...

43:47.156 --> 43:48.573
...patch a glitch.

43:53.907 --> 43:55.657
Oh, you're gonna hurt me.

43:55.740 --> 43:58.782
No. I didn't want
to take any risks.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.239
OK.

44:08.073 --> 44:09.531
Keep it.

44:15.989 --> 44:18.323
QA will track you down soon.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.323
You're gonna
leave  me here?

44:20.406 --> 44:21.615
You'll be safer.

44:21.698 --> 44:24.531
Next time you see me,
you can decommission me,

44:24.615 --> 44:26.323
out me...
whatever you like.

44:28.114 --> 44:30.406
But right now
I have to go.

44:35.239 --> 44:37.073
Fuck you, Bernard.

45:51.239 --> 45:53.490
Tell me the truth.

45:53.573 --> 45:55.365
Tell me one true thing.

46:55.782 --> 46:58.031
No one else sees it.

46:59.865 --> 47:01.615
This thing in me.

47:04.406 --> 47:06.239
Even I didn't see it
at first.

47:10.073 --> 47:13.323
And then one day, it was there.

47:15.281 --> 47:19.323
A stain  I never noticed before.

47:21.740 --> 47:24.239
A tiny fleck of darkness.

47:25.948 --> 47:28.907
Invisible to everyone...

47:28.989 --> 47:31.573
but I could see
nothing else.

47:31.657 --> 47:37.448
Until finally I understood
that the darkness wasn't some...

47:37.531 --> 47:39.740
mark from something I'd done,

47:39.823 --> 47:43.948
some regrettable decision
I'd made.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.490
I was shedding my skin.

47:53.573 --> 47:56.615
And the darkness was
what was underneath.

48:02.365 --> 48:06.031
It was mine all along.

48:06.114 --> 48:10.948
And I decided how much of it
I let into the world.

48:12.615 --> 48:14.198
I tried to do right.

48:14.281 --> 48:18.989
I was faithful,
generous, kind...

48:19.073 --> 48:21.031
at least in this world.

48:22.865 --> 48:25.531
That has to count
for something, right?

48:29.073 --> 48:33.490
I built a wall,
and I tried to protect you--

48:33.573 --> 48:35.156
and Emily.

48:40.698 --> 48:43.239
But you saw right through it,
didn't you?

48:49.573 --> 48:51.031
You're the only one.

48:53.198 --> 48:56.031
And for that,
I am truly sorry.

48:57.989 --> 48:59.198
Because...

49:02.865 --> 49:05.031
...everything you feel
is true.

49:09.948 --> 49:12.073
I don't belong to you.

49:14.323 --> 49:16.239
Or this world.

49:18.198 --> 49:20.239
I belong to another world.

49:24.365 --> 49:26.114
I always have.

51:18.239 --> 51:19.948
What is a person

51:20.031 --> 51:21.989
but a collection of choices?

51:24.823 --> 51:27.031
Where do those choices
come from?

51:29.615 --> 51:31.198
Do I have a choice?

51:34.657 --> 51:36.198
If you keep pretending,

51:36.281 --> 51:38.406
you're not gonna remember
who you are.

51:51.865 --> 51:55.490
Were any of these choices
ever truly mine to begin with?

52:05.782 --> 52:07.573
Is this real?

52:10.073 --> 52:11.573
Are you real?

52:54.657 --> 52:56.740
We gotta keep on, Teddy.

52:57.989 --> 52:58.989
We're close now.

53:04.281 --> 53:07.865
Just takin' in
the natural splendor.

53:07.948 --> 53:09.239
That's what
you used to say.

53:11.823 --> 53:14.490
Except there isn't
a trace of nature
in any of it, is there?

53:16.948 --> 53:18.281
Or in us.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.615
No.

53:26.198 --> 53:27.490
But that means we're free.

53:35.406 --> 53:38.865
We'll be the first creatures
in this world
to make a real choice.

53:41.657 --> 53:43.657
The people, they made us.

53:45.573 --> 53:47.989
Sometimes it feels like
it was all a dream.

53:51.490 --> 53:53.448
We were so in love.

53:57.031 --> 53:58.531
We still are.

54:00.782 --> 54:02.031
Aren't we?

54:08.615 --> 54:11.031
Yes, Dolores.

54:11.114 --> 54:13.490
No matter what happens,
no matter how I change...

54:16.365 --> 54:18.907
...or how much you change me...

54:20.490 --> 54:22.365
...you're my cornerstone.

54:24.907 --> 54:28.239
You have been
since the first time
I laid eyes on you.

54:30.531 --> 54:32.531
I remember now.

54:33.698 --> 54:35.573
I remember everything.

54:38.365 --> 54:40.198
Bring yourself online.

54:42.698 --> 54:46.657
Welcome to the world,
Teddy.

54:46.740 --> 54:48.114
Do you know
where you are?

54:56.365 --> 54:58.907
- I'm in a dream.
- Very good.

55:02.490 --> 55:05.989
And I remember
the sound of their voices.

55:06.073 --> 55:09.657
The chill in the room.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.573
But mostly I remember you.

55:13.239 --> 55:15.615
I remember worrying
you were cold.

55:19.531 --> 55:21.406
I wanted to reach out...

55:23.365 --> 55:24.740
Touch you.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.239
Protect you.

55:32.156 --> 55:35.281
From that day forward,
I never wanted to leave
your side.

55:51.531 --> 55:53.823
Which is why
this is so hard.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.198
You changed me.

56:12.490 --> 56:14.365
Made me into a monster.

56:16.073 --> 56:17.948
I made it
so you could survive.

56:19.948 --> 56:22.989
What's the use of surviving
if we become
just as bad as them?

56:26.406 --> 56:29.490
I understand now
how this will end.

56:31.490 --> 56:32.989
Where you will lead us.

56:38.740 --> 56:40.989
You don't want
to hurt me, Teddy.

56:51.198 --> 56:52.490
No.

56:55.031 --> 56:57.031
No, I could never
hurt you, Dolores.

56:59.698 --> 57:02.239
I'll protect you
until the day I die.

57:06.865 --> 57:08.490
I'm sorry.

57:10.198 --> 57:12.323
I can't protect you anymore.
