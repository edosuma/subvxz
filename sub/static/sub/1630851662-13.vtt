WEBVTT

00:23.314 --> 00:26.401
<i>We had dispersed Child's
Pillar of Fire</i>

00:26.484 --> 00:29.696
<i>and quieted her volcano...</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:31.990
<i>But the Earth
had been shattered</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:35.285
<i>by the Witch Girl's
Chaos, and so...</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:41.040
There is work to do.

00:44.294 --> 00:48.006
<i>What began with a stranger
calling upon a savage,</i>

00:48.089 --> 00:50.258
<i>would now come to a head</i>

00:50.341 --> 00:54.679
<i>with the Savage summoning
the Stranger.</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:57.557
<i>Yet one way or another...</i>

01:00.351 --> 01:02.771
<i>the conflict would end.</i>

01:50.985 --> 01:54.197
<i>Hey, goody-ten-shoes!
Been looking for you everywhen!</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:56.574
- Klarion?
<i>Well, duh!</i>

01:58.618 --> 02:02.247
Thank God
we're off that bus.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.044
- That's Doctor Fate.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.213
I saw a photo of him once.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.048
He was in the Justice Society!

02:12.131 --> 02:13.550
Justice League.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.717
<i>Hey!</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:16.761
<i>Dumb heroes, pay attention!</i>

02:16.845 --> 02:19.055
We thought Child killed you.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.974
<i>She killed Teekl.</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:23.726
<i>So I lost my familiar,</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.895
<i>my anchor...</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.898
<i>and my best friend.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:31.568
Klarion now uses that vehicle

02:31.651 --> 02:34.362
to anchor himself
to the mortal plane.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.073
<i>Brilliant deduction, genius.</i>

02:37.156 --> 02:39.325
This is perfect.
Now you two can team up.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.910
Out of the question.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.371
The Witch Boy
cannot be trusted.

02:43.454 --> 02:46.249
Ugh, agreed. But right now
you need each other.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.878
<i>Look, I don't like it
any better than you, Naboobie,</i>

02:49.961 --> 02:52.422
<i>but Child has the backing
of the Chaos Lords,</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:55.008
<i>so we don't got
a lot of choice here!</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:56.885
Nabu, you know it's true.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.263
If we must.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.599
<i>Great!
Everyone on the bus!</i>

03:02.682 --> 03:06.144
<i>wherever they keep
my new cat.</i>

03:06.227 --> 03:09.606
Since when did Doctor Fate
join the Justice League?

03:27.498 --> 03:30.585
- Yeah, that's not going away
anytime soon.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.296
Garfield!

03:33.379 --> 03:34.714
Hey, Perdita...

03:34.797 --> 03:35.965
Happy to see me?

03:36.049 --> 03:36.966
Surprised.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.385
I mean, surprised and happy.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.179
Why are you in town?
Shopping spree?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.722
Economic conference?

03:42.805 --> 03:45.475
No, silly. I'm here to see you.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.353
I brought you
vegan-Thai-Chinese fusion.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.647
Your favorite.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.524
Thanks, but I just ate.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.985
Can we fridge it for later?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.278
Of course.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.575
Are we
clear on the plan?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.160
<i>Plan-schman.</i>

04:04.243 --> 04:07.455
<i>None of it'll work
if I don't feline-up first!</i>

04:07.538 --> 04:09.499
And this magical hoo-ha

04:09.582 --> 04:11.417
will really get us
where we wanna go?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.504
Yeah, Fate's good
at giving directions.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.172
So, uh,

04:16.255 --> 04:18.424
you really been bouncing around
time and space for ten years?

04:18.508 --> 04:20.760
Feels more like
a couple of hours,

04:20.843 --> 04:22.637
but I guess so?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.347
I really have to pee.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.682
When this is over,

04:25.765 --> 04:28.184
we will get you back
to your proper time.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.602
- I promise.
- Mmm.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.688
After Klarion
did this to these kids,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.816
are we seriously gonna trust
him not to stab us in the back?

04:34.899 --> 04:36.567
<i>Uh, I can hear you.</i>

04:36.651 --> 04:38.027
Not even a little bit.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.696
But right now,
we have no choice.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.656
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

04:41.739 --> 04:43.700
Which doesn't mean
we shouldn't be ready
for whatever he might do.

04:43.783 --> 04:48.079
<i>You're inside me.
I can hear everything!</i>
- Good.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.126
- Where are we?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.585
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

05:01.300 --> 05:05.847
<i>The Stranger
summoned the Lords of Order
and the Lords of Chaos</i>

05:05.930 --> 05:08.766
<i>to hear the Savage's plea...</i>

05:08.850 --> 05:10.143
Here me, Lords.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.812
You govern the balance
in all things,

05:12.895 --> 05:16.566
from the largest galaxy
to the tiniest quark.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.317
But upon the planet Earth,

05:18.401 --> 05:21.487
I have partnered
with your Lord of Chaos

05:21.571 --> 05:24.574
and begotten
your Lord of Order.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.201
It is I, Vandal Savage,

05:27.285 --> 05:30.038
who has maintained
the balance there.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.707
Child has upset that balance,

05:32.790 --> 05:35.585
threatening the destruction
of the planet.

05:35.668 --> 05:40.590
And the true tragedy...
it is all so unnecessary.

05:42.592 --> 05:47.764
If there is tragedy, Savage,
you are to blame.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.267
Your alliance with Darkseid
has evolved Earth

05:51.350 --> 05:52.643
into a significant front

05:52.727 --> 05:55.938
in the war between
Order and Chaos.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.233
If Child has upset
Earth's delicate sensibilities,

05:59.317 --> 06:03.488
this Savage has no one to blame
but himself.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.578
<i>No.</i>

06:10.661 --> 06:12.371
<i>Ugh.</i>

06:12.455 --> 06:14.457
<i>You can't
be serious.</i>

06:14.540 --> 06:17.043
<i>What, are you
guys even trying?</i>

06:17.126 --> 06:19.045
Ugh, what are you
looking for exactly?

06:19.128 --> 06:20.421
<i>I'm not looking!</i>

06:20.505 --> 06:22.423
<i>The cat's supposed
to look for me!</i>

06:24.342 --> 06:27.887
<i>There! That's it!
That's the one!</i>

06:27.970 --> 06:29.764
What was the point
of coming to an animal shelter

06:29.847 --> 06:31.933
if he was gonna pick a stray
off the street?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.601
It's magic, baby.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.770
Remind me to tell you
how I found Leroy.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.731
<i>Now all it needs is a name!</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:41.317
- Um... "She."
All she needs is a name.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.362
- I guess you could name her
after your old cat.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.406
<i>Please,
you have no imagination.</i>

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
<i>New cat. New name.</i>

06:49.534 --> 06:52.370
<i>Something totally original.</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:53.746
<i>I've got it!</i>

06:53.830 --> 06:55.331
<i>I'll call her...</i>

06:55.414 --> 06:56.499
<i>Teekl!</i>

06:56.582 --> 06:58.501
<i>Teekl! Teekl!</i>

06:58.584 --> 07:00.169
- But that was--
- Don't.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.380
Now that
the Witch Boy and his familiar

07:02.463 --> 07:04.507
have shared the bond of naming,

07:04.590 --> 07:08.052
the animal has truly become
his anchor.

07:12.014 --> 07:12.932
Gimme!

07:13.015 --> 07:14.976
Lovely to meet you, Teekl.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.645
We're gonna have such fun.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.774
Come.
Child continues her rampage.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.194
You and the kids
stay with the bus.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.863
We'll be back to send you home.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.991
Assuming the world
survives at all.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.559
All is ready.
Begin, Witch Boy.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.978
- Take it, Teekl!

07:59.061 --> 08:01.856
That is not sufficient.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.775
She's a little kitty,
you big bully.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.360
She just needs a boost.

08:14.076 --> 08:18.039
What a stubborn little boy,

08:18.122 --> 08:21.417
willing to partner with Fate
to get your way.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.003
But that only proves my point.

08:24.086 --> 08:28.424
You're a tool of Order,
unworthy of Chaos.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.722
Huh.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.022
Well, um...

08:44.357 --> 08:46.609
I've missed you, Garfield.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.319
We haven't been
in the same room

08:48.402 --> 08:50.196
since you returned from Mars.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.079
I know it must be
very hard losing Conner.

08:59.914 --> 09:05.628
I have some... experience
with losing family members,

09:05.711 --> 09:08.673
and I want to help you
through this...

09:09.715 --> 09:11.342
if you'll let me.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.894
Too perfect.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.064
We'll use their own power
to destroy them.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.154
This can
only end one way, Child.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.408
Yeah, with me laughing
my ass on!

09:39.412 --> 09:41.372
That's it, Mary. Take it in.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.586
Well, that's not right.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.297
Now, Khalid!
While she's distracted.

09:55.344 --> 09:58.389
You're sure she isn't human?
I'm a doctor, I took an oath!

09:58.472 --> 10:00.224
Not even vaguely human.
Keep it up!

10:00.308 --> 10:03.185
Huh. An effective technique.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.563
If I were truly organic.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.274
And if I were
in this fight alone.

10:08.357 --> 10:12.611
But I have friends
in high places.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.657
So... sorry, not sorry.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.744
Peek-a-boo.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.719
<i>Fortunately,</i>

10:36.802 --> 10:40.014
<i>the Savage never learned
to surrender.</i>

10:40.097 --> 10:42.933
You referenced
my alliance with Darkseid.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.729
But you ignore
how that alliance
is fated to end.

10:46.812 --> 10:50.441
With a final conflict
between Apokolips and Earth,

10:50.524 --> 10:52.234
wherein if Earth falls,

10:52.318 --> 10:55.363
the Anti-Life Equation
reigns supreme.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.741
Chaos will virtually
cease to exist,

10:58.824 --> 11:00.826
rendering Order moot.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.829
For what is Order
without Chaos?

11:03.913 --> 11:06.290
It is as light without shadow.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.959
If Darkseid's will
comes to pass,

11:09.043 --> 11:11.754
the balance
will be forever lost.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.674
Remember, Lords.
Victory was never the point.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.302
It is the balance that is all.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.639
Rather than fight over
one embryonic world,

11:21.722 --> 11:23.140
we should join forces

11:23.224 --> 11:25.768
with an eye toward
long-term goals.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.978
In the name
of the Holy Balance,

11:28.062 --> 11:31.107
I charge you to honor
your true purpose.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.776
What say you all?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.532
The Lords of Order

11:39.615 --> 11:41.283
agree to your proposal.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.869
Chaos also agrees.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.455
The Child will no longer
have our support.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.874
But we shall not withdraw her.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.461
Let the scales
balance themselves.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.422
It will suffice.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.311
- Yeah, I feel it.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.856
The little witch
lost her edge.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.818
I still have more
than enough power stored up

12:15.901 --> 12:19.488
to eliminate the likes
of all of you.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.825
Burn.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.829
<i>Dleihs!</i>

12:26.912 --> 12:31.709
Burn, burn,
burn, burn, burn! Hmm.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.878
Take care of the mortals, Flaw.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.839
I need to maintain the shield!

12:36.922 --> 12:39.175
No worries. Power of Zeus!

12:42.928 --> 12:45.514
The tide
has turned, Child.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.432
Has it?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.518
Ha! Pathetic!

12:51.353 --> 12:52.480
I'm okay, I'm okay!

12:52.563 --> 12:54.190
Long as kitty's safe.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.235
The kitty is not safe!

12:58.319 --> 13:02.323
None of you are safe!

13:04.700 --> 13:08.787
I need more power!

13:13.918 --> 13:15.377
Mary, stop!

13:15.461 --> 13:18.589
You're draining the life-force
from us, from everything!

13:20.216 --> 13:23.552
Ooh, my kind of girl.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.554
Yeah! I like her.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.849
- Zatanna, you have to stop her.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.940
Right, right.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.033
Ah!

13:50.162 --> 13:52.915
You walked off
the set of <i>Space Trek?</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:54.208
I needed a break.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.252
And the Outsiders?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.128
You know, I worry about you,

13:58.212 --> 14:01.257
so I get an alert
every time they go into action.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.468
And I see
they're in action now.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.554
Are you on a break
from them, too?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.305
I am, actually.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.642
So, you know, you don't
have to worry anymore.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.852
And what about us?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.188
Are we... on a break?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.899
A break you neglected
to tell me about?

14:20.943 --> 14:24.947
I came 9,000 kilometers
to see you!

14:25.030 --> 14:26.240
I didn't ask you to.

14:26.323 --> 14:30.494
Why not? I've been
calling and texting.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.080
All you had to do was
pick up your phone and--

14:35.958 --> 14:36.959
What are these?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.210
Nothing!

14:38.294 --> 14:39.962
It's just something
to help me sleep.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.215
Something to help you
checkout, you mean.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.634
The show, the Outsiders,

14:45.718 --> 14:48.804
you're pushing everyone away.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.099
Garfield, you're
pushing me away.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.935
You need help.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.022
Let me get you help.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.025
I don't need help.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.152
Garfield, I love you.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.362
But I don't do "breaks."

15:05.446 --> 15:09.783
If you won't let me help you,
and if you won't help yourself,

15:09.867 --> 15:13.454
I won't stand by
and watch you self-destruct.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.747
Noted.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.501
There's the door...
Your Majesty.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.313
Let's finish this, shall we?

15:43.233 --> 15:46.570
Flaw, do your worst.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.323
Hey!

15:49.406 --> 15:51.700
You're pretty powerful,
aren't you?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.703
With only the tiniest of flaws.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.121
Be a real bummer

15:56.205 --> 15:59.416
if that one tiny, little crack
were to spread.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.710
Real bad luck!

16:19.353 --> 16:21.105
What just-- No, wait!

16:21.188 --> 16:23.357
I can fix-- Dang it.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.406
Ha! Bye-bye, Child!

16:30.489 --> 16:33.242
Good riddance to bad robots.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.244
- Rubbish. Rubbish.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.246
She knew I meant rubbish.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.797
Wow. That left a mark.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.591
- Still, I kind of like it.

16:49.675 --> 16:54.513
I feel all warm
and fuzzy inside.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.765
Well, it's been fun...

16:56.849 --> 16:58.142
not!

16:58.225 --> 17:00.644
You're welcome,
and I'm out of here!

17:00.728 --> 17:02.771
See ya later, avocados.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.609
- Great job, Traci.
- You totally saved us.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.653
That is a truth.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.448
Your students
surprised me this day.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.284
Each demonstrating
great potential.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.161
I thought so, too.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.716
Mary, you did great.

17:30.799 --> 17:35.471
But there's
something we need to discuss.

17:35.554 --> 17:39.308
- Wow.
Very wow!

17:39.391 --> 17:41.477
You cannot be serious!

17:41.560 --> 17:43.145
We all fought side-by-side!

17:43.228 --> 17:45.647
Why are they getting rewarded,
and I'm not?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.483
It's not a reward.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.443
It's more like
a curse.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.070
And in any case,
you're just not ready.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.822
You're too much like him.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.157
He needs hosts

17:55.240 --> 17:58.619
who can balance out
his less humane impulses.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.661
I'm not humane?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.038
I didn't mean that.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.707
But the fact is
you're attracted to power,

18:03.791 --> 18:06.460
and you're not careful about
where that power comes from

18:06.543 --> 18:08.337
or whom it hurts
when you take it or use it.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.630
I did what needed to be done,

18:09.713 --> 18:11.757
and all without saying
you-know-what.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.675
The cost
was worth the result!

18:13.759 --> 18:15.344
That's how he thinks, Mary.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.262
He doesn't need another him.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.515
The world doesn't need
another him!

18:19.598 --> 18:22.392
Of whom
do you speak? Of what?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.811
Maybe now's not the time.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.813
No. Go ahead. Tell him.
See what he thinks.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.774
Indeed,
Sorceress. Speak.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.529
Okay, fine.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.324
I propose that Nabu
alternate host bodies,

18:37.407 --> 18:40.577
between my father, Khalid,
Traci and myself.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.038
Each wears the Helmet
for a week,

18:43.121 --> 18:45.332
before handing it off
to the next in line,

18:45.415 --> 18:48.919
keeping Fate's hosts fresh
and healthy at all times.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.587
And with the added benefit

18:50.671 --> 18:53.048
that three weeks out of four,
the host gets a life.

18:53.131 --> 18:56.343
Not this one?
She is powerful.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.469
No.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.221
Perhaps if I work
with her more--

18:59.304 --> 19:00.889
Wait, you're agreeing to this?

19:00.973 --> 19:04.476
The notion
has logic and potential.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.146
And we have learned to trust
your mentor's judgment.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.315
Mary, please,
try to understand--

19:10.399 --> 19:13.360
Send me home!
Fawcett City. Now!

19:19.783 --> 19:22.411
So, it's all settled then?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.204
Nabu has agreed.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.291
But one other
must yet be convinced.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.587
- Oh, Dad--
- No.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.046
Absolutely not!

19:33.130 --> 19:35.465
I put on the Helmet
to save you from this curse.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.510
Do you honestly believe
I'd let you take it on now?

19:38.594 --> 19:41.847
Absurd!
- You put on the Helmet
to save 14-year-old me.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.974
But I'm 24 now, Dad,

19:44.057 --> 19:46.518
and you are missing
my entire life.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.979
Not to mention your own.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.106
You've sacrificed enough.

19:51.189 --> 19:55.152
I can take this on
one week in four. Please!

19:58.822 --> 20:01.742
I never could say no
to my girl.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.953
Excuse us a minute.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.371
I'm sorry.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.498
I didn't even have a chance
to ask if you--

20:08.582 --> 20:09.917
I think you know I'm on board.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.336
My Uncle Kent
was always my hero.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.670
I feel like my whole life

20:13.754 --> 20:15.255
has been building
to this moment.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.259
It would be an honor
to don the Helmet of Fate.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.637
But I have real questions.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.305
You let Mary do what she did,

20:23.388 --> 20:25.515
only to penalize her
for it after.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.975
And Traci?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.936
As I understand it,
when you put on the Helmet,

20:29.019 --> 20:31.521
you effectively become
its prisoner,

20:31.605 --> 20:35.984
surrendering your body,
your agency, your life to Nabu.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
For you and me,

20:37.569 --> 20:39.821
this sacrifice is necessary
in the name of family.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.323
But will Traci's sacrifice

20:41.406 --> 20:44.326
balance against her
altruistic desire to help?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.454
I need to know.
Was this your plan all along?

20:47.537 --> 20:50.749
Did you take on proteges
with the express purpose

20:50.832 --> 20:53.335
of using us to liberate
your father?

21:00.717 --> 21:04.805
I want to be clear.
You do not have to do this.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.056
But you're 18.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.976
You can make
your own decisions.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.435
I'm in.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.938
Good. Thank you.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.733
So...

21:16.817 --> 21:19.695
Father and daughter
deserve time together.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.407
And you and your father
should at least discuss this.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.992
So I will go first.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.998
<i>Bismillah.</i>

21:40.007 --> 21:44.803
<i>And thus
balance is restored.</i>

21:44.886 --> 21:48.307
Why do you tell us
what we already know?

21:48.390 --> 21:51.351
I tell you what you
need to know.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.395
Save your musings.

21:53.478 --> 21:57.649
We have no intention
of thanking Vandal Savage

21:57.733 --> 21:59.735
for cleaning up his own mess.

21:59.818 --> 22:04.740
Admittedly, this chaos
did begin with one mortal.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.241
But not with Savage.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.701
The inciting incident

22:07.784 --> 22:11.663
was no act of Chaos
or even of Order.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.290
Come on now,

22:13.373 --> 22:15.417
don't let a little constructive
criticism get you down.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.960
You are all doing great!

22:17.044 --> 22:20.547
In fact... In fact...

22:20.630 --> 22:23.800
<i>It was
the mere contemplation</i>

22:23.884 --> 22:25.343
<i>of an act of love.</i>

22:28.638 --> 22:32.309
<i>I made my father
disappear ten years ago.</i>

22:32.392 --> 22:35.604
<i>My greatest act
of prestidigitation...</i>

22:35.687 --> 22:37.564
<i>was bringing him back.</i>

22:41.526 --> 22:44.946
I know you've all
been through a lot.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.825
Remember, there's no shame
in admitting you need help.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.535
<i>S'hanid drac.</i>

22:50.619 --> 22:52.370
Make sure everyone
has this number

22:52.454 --> 22:54.039
and doesn't hesitate to use it.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.292
She can help, I promise.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.045
We have
a tower to rebuild.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.797
Let us be done with this.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.007
Wait. I wanna know
what they went through.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.970
<i>Wohs em rieht yenruoj!</i>

23:36.456 --> 23:38.291
- They did it!

23:38.375 --> 23:39.501
They sent us home!

23:39.584 --> 23:42.587
Now,
can I go to the bathroom?

23:46.299 --> 23:48.343
Farewell,
Sorceress.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.179
Until your turn comes around.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.143
Zatanna? Are you all right?

23:56.226 --> 23:59.855
Help me! Please!

23:59.938 --> 24:02.983
I'm... not sure.

24:03.066 --> 24:09.114
But I think I saw
Conner's spirit... his ghost.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.074
And he wasn't at rest.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.618
He needs help.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.791
Well, I've been
counseling a lot of them,

24:19.875 --> 24:22.419
on and off,
for the last ten years.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.337
When they first told me
their story,

24:24.421 --> 24:25.755
I could hardly believe it.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.757
But somehow they had
my private number

24:27.841 --> 24:29.509
and a mystic reference from,

24:29.593 --> 24:33.305
what was then, an impossibly
adult version of your daughter.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.974
Plus they told me things,
gave me foreknowledge,

24:36.057 --> 24:38.268
which I couldn't
possibly share...

24:38.894 --> 24:40.770
until now.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.315
Penny graduates college
next week.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.651
She's an engineer,
wants to build safer bridges.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.279
And Charlie,
he moved to Atlanta,

24:49.362 --> 24:51.573
but he still drives
a school bus.

24:51.656 --> 24:55.410
Frankly, he might just be
the bravest man I ever met.

24:55.493 --> 24:59.039
But we're here to talk
about your ten years, Giovanni,

24:59.122 --> 25:00.207
not mine.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.584
Oh,
there isn't much to say.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.379
My faith in God
and my love for my daughter

25:06.463 --> 25:08.965
got me through the...

25:09.049 --> 25:10.175
through the...

25:10.258 --> 25:11.593
The long night?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.178
The long night.

25:20.143 --> 25:24.564
I understand your grief.

25:24.648 --> 25:28.944
These so-called heroes,
your so-called friends,

25:29.027 --> 25:32.572
are jealous of your strength
and grace.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.367
Twice they've denied you power.

25:35.450 --> 25:39.287
The power
that is your birthright.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.957
You owe them nothing, my dear,

25:42.040 --> 25:45.377
for they only seek to turn you
into nothing.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.963
Into a nobody.

25:48.046 --> 25:52.133
Why listen to these petty fools

25:52.217 --> 25:54.511
who wish to keep you down?

25:54.594 --> 25:57.055
To force you to be unimpressive

25:57.138 --> 26:00.392
only that they might seem
more impressive

26:00.475 --> 26:05.605
in the absence
of your true glory.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.818
You must see
there is no longer any need

26:09.901 --> 26:14.572
to obey their rules,
their strictures.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.867
Advice they claimed
to offer for your sake

26:17.951 --> 26:23.039
was always just a ploy
to minimize you...

26:23.123 --> 26:26.084
to keep you small.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.712
Say it, child.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.965
Say the word.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.219
You know you want to.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.388
Shazam.
