09:37.766 --> 09:39.852
This is gonna be so weird
when they come down.

09:39.936 --> 09:42.313
Let's just go. Okay?
Come on.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.650
- Wait. But I'm hungry.
- We'll get breakfast.

09:45.735 --> 09:48.112
Let's just go! Come on!

09:48.196 --> 09:51.032
Let's go! Come on!
Where are you going?

09:51.116 --> 09:53.036
Anywhere.
Where is your mother?

09:53.118 --> 09:55.831
I need to talk to her.
I don't think it's a good time right now.

09:55.914 --> 09:57.166
She won't come out of her room.

09:57.249 --> 10:00.629
She's really upset, isn't she?
Big-time.

10:00.711 --> 10:02.923
How'd you know?
We called.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.592
Tell me exactly what she said.

10:04.674 --> 10:06.886
I don't know.
There was just a lot of screaming.

10:06.968 --> 10:09.223
Where was your father
when all this was going on?

10:09.305 --> 10:11.183
Oh. He was right behind her.

10:11.266 --> 10:13.143
[Shuddering, Groaning]

10:14.729 --> 10:16.772
It's not coming out!
It's not coming out!

10:16.855 --> 10:18.691
Blot! Don't rub, blot!

10:18.776 --> 10:20.235
We are beyond
blotting and rubbing.

10:20.318 --> 10:22.864
We've moved on to sweating and crying.
Okay. Let's not panic.

10:22.947 --> 10:25.825
We'll tell Amelia what happened,
and then we'll pay to have it cleaned.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.663
What if it can't be cleaned, Mitchell?
Okay, okay.

10:28.746 --> 10:30.373
Then we'll pay for a new rug.

10:30.456 --> 10:31.624
Are you insane?

10:31.708 --> 10:35.588
This is a limited edition
alpaca handmade Stark rug.

10:35.671 --> 10:38.509
I saw it in Architectural Digest.
It costs $50,000.

10:38.591 --> 10:40.635
It was in Diane Keaton's house.
Oh, my-

10:40.719 --> 10:42.680
Oh, no. It was in-
oh, what's-her-name's house.

10:42.764 --> 10:44.515
Um, from Prizzi's Honor.

10:44.598 --> 10:48.020
From, uh-
Oh, she was in Addams Family.

10:48.103 --> 10:50.814
Anjelica Huston!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:50.897 --> 10:52.901
Oh, my God.
$50,000?

10:52.984 --> 10:55.571
For a rug? Cam, we don't
have that kind of money.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.617
Maybe she won't make us pay. I mean, we wouldn't
make someone pay if this happened to us.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.999
Did you not hear her on the phone?
“Fix it! Replace it! Write me a check!"

11:04.082 --> 11:06.251
She probably has that
embroidered on a pillow,

11:06.333 --> 11:09.213
right next to a jar
of human tears.

11:09.338 --> 11:12.300
Maybe we can turn this around. How?
It looks like someone bled out over here.

11:12.382 --> 11:14.761
No. I mean the rug.
Maybe we can turn the whole rug around.

11:14.844 --> 11:17.806
Put it under the couch. See?
No one would ever know it's there.

11:17.889 --> 11:20.935
Well, we would know.
Well-

11:23.480 --> 11:25.817
What are you thinking?
You don't wanna know.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.653
No, tell me, 'cause I think
I'm thinking the same thing.

11:28.736 --> 11:31.824
I seriously doubt that, because now I'm
thinking it was Joan Collins's house.

11:34.201 --> 11:36.412
[ Phil ] Okay. [ Clears Throat ]

11:36.496 --> 11:38.124
All right.

11:38.249 --> 11:41.543
Gloria. What are you- What are you doing here?
Wait. Where are the kids?

11:41.627 --> 11:44.380
They just left. They told me
that you were very upset.

11:44.505 --> 11:47.843
Oh, God. And you have every right to be.
It was bad.

11:47.926 --> 11:49.261
I know that.

11:49.346 --> 11:51.473
[ Sighs ]
Claire, it was an accident.

11:51.556 --> 11:52.974
That doesn't make it any better.

11:53.059 --> 11:55.018
Okay, you're right.
I know how you feel.

11:55.102 --> 11:57.772
Oh, God. It happened to me
before with another woman.

11:57.855 --> 12:00.400
And that time,
I was the one getting it.

12:00.485 --> 12:03.236
And it hurt.
Wow.

12:03.321 --> 12:05.032
I'm sorry it had to come out like this.

12:05.115 --> 12:09.161
But you have to admit that you're only happy
when you're the one cracking the whip.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.246
What?
Come on.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.124
We all know how you ride Phil.

12:13.209 --> 12:16.087
But maybe if you just let go a little,

12:16.170 --> 12:18.632
maybe even taste my cupcakes,

12:18.715 --> 12:20.383
I will join you.

12:20.466 --> 12:23.720
No. Uh- No. No.
I am so confused right now.

12:23.805 --> 12:26.058
I may pass out.
What are you talking about?

12:26.140 --> 12:27.809
What are you talking about?

12:27.893 --> 12:32.107
The kids just walked in
on me and Phil in bed.

12:32.232 --> 12:36.277
We've just spent the last hour holed up in our
room, trying to figure out what to say to them.

12:37.238 --> 12:40.408
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

12:40.492 --> 12:43.203
Can I use your computer?
I just need to check one e-mail.

12:43.328 --> 12:46.582
Yeah, the kitchen. Gloria, I just
switched us to the next flight.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.459
Did you guys get everything
straightened out?

12:48.544 --> 12:52.424
Claire is very upset because the kids
just walk in on them having sex.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.591
Oh, geez.

12:53.675 --> 12:55.427
Now that we're all up to speed-

12:55.511 --> 13:00.642
She's so upset that she hasn't even had time
to apply her makeup or use her computer.

13:02.436 --> 13:04.480
What are you even
doing here, Dad?

13:04.563 --> 13:07.066
I don't think you should be the one
doing the questioning here, missy.

13:07.149 --> 13:10.779
Don't get mad at her. Your wife's the one
who just offered up her cupcakes.

13:10.862 --> 13:11.863
Phil.

13:17.537 --> 13:19.456
Good thing we had
Mom's gas card.

13:19.540 --> 13:22.168
Don't make me regret
buying you that lighter, dude.

13:22.252 --> 13:24.837
Put it down.
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

13:24.922 --> 13:26.923
Our parents are totally irresponsible.

13:27.008 --> 13:30.761
And I'm not just talking about us
walking in on their little freak show earlier.

13:30.846 --> 13:34.141
Just let it go.
No! We're lucky to be alive.

13:34.224 --> 13:38.772
How often do they let Luke
go to school in shorts in the winter?

13:38.855 --> 13:41.566
And they let me ride in the front seat
before I was 60 pounds.

13:41.650 --> 13:45.739
And they never shut the gate
at the top of the stairs when we were babies.

13:45.821 --> 13:48.241
Do you know how many times
you fell on your head? Do you?

13:48.326 --> 13:51.288
No.
We get it. It was bad.

13:51.371 --> 13:52.915
But, you know,

13:52.997 --> 13:59.172
I guess it's better than having parents
who fight all the time... maybe.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.716
My friend Jacob's parents
are getting divorced.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.095
He has to move out of his house.

14:04.178 --> 14:08.476
They told him last week.
That sucks.

14:08.558 --> 14:11.478
He'll get used to it.
Half of my friends' parents are divorced.

14:11.562 --> 14:14.650
Mine too.
It's insane..

14:14.732 --> 14:18.655
So it's a good thing
Mom and Dad still do sex.

14:18.738 --> 14:22.785
Better than Mom leaving the stove on,
which she's done twice this month.

14:22.868 --> 14:25.996
I just realized we haven't even gotten
to the worst part of it yet.

14:26.081 --> 14:27.831
Which is?

14:27.916 --> 14:29.751
They're gonna
want to talk about it.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.547
Maybe not.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.342
Are you kidding?
Their parents never talked about anything,

14:35.425 --> 14:37.469
so they want to talk about everything.

14:37.554 --> 14:41.306
Yeah. They called a family meeting
when we switched to one percent milk.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.353
[ Door Closes ] I don't
know where those kids are.

14:44.436 --> 14:48.441
What is more important than putting
a working lock on a bedroom door?

14:48.524 --> 14:51.111
You are one to talk.
What is that supposed to mean?

14:52.529 --> 14:54.866
You don't remember when I walked in
on you and Mom that time?

14:54.949 --> 14:56.702
Gloria, could we please go now?

14:56.785 --> 14:59.622
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So why don't you
just get off your high horse, Dad?

14:59.705 --> 15:02.374
At least I am trying to handle this
better than the two of you did.

15:02.499 --> 15:05.254
What did we do? You made gimlets
and went back to your room.

15:05.336 --> 15:07.047
What were we supposed to do?

15:07.130 --> 15:09.384
You-You could have talked to me.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.929
You could have made sure that I was okay.
Wanna talk about it?

15:12.012 --> 15:13.680
Yes.
Fine!

15:13.764 --> 15:17.352
Your mother and I were watching
a particularly racy episode of Hart to Hart.

15:17.477 --> 15:20.272
Oh! Stefanie Powers had to go
undercover as a call girl.

15:20.355 --> 15:21.858
Mm-mmm. Dad-
Hang on.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.692
This whole story makes
more sense- Okay.

15:23.776 --> 15:25.778
If you know I got a thing
for thigh-high boots.

15:25.863 --> 15:28.364
Oh, gross. Gross.
You are ruining sex for me.

15:28.448 --> 15:29.659
And boots.

15:29.742 --> 15:30.909
Hey.

15:32.077 --> 15:34.748
Working okay for you?
Yes.

15:34.832 --> 15:37.294
I was sending an e-mail
to my brother in Colombia.

15:37.377 --> 15:40.631
- Oh.
- I was telling him about Claire.

15:40.714 --> 15:44.636
You know, I realized
there's so much I don't know about her.

15:44.719 --> 15:48.182
Like, for example,
what is her favorite word?

15:48.264 --> 15:51.602
Or what was
her first pet's name?

15:51.686 --> 15:53.813
Gloria, I'm not an idiot.

15:53.896 --> 15:55.690
Are you trying to get
Claire's password?

15:55.775 --> 15:58.486
[Sighs]
Okay, fine.

15:58.569 --> 16:00.363
I sent her something by mistake.

16:00.446 --> 16:04.118
I need to get into Claire's e-mail
to erase it before she sees it.

16:04.201 --> 16:06.704
- Before I see what?
- Hola, Claire.

16:06.787 --> 16:09.499
Hi, Gloria.
Before I see what?

16:09.582 --> 16:12.087
It's so embarrassing.

16:12.169 --> 16:14.798
[Sighs]
You see, Jay and I-

16:14.880 --> 16:17.175
it's a naked picture of Gloria.

16:17.258 --> 16:18.886
Whoa.

16:18.968 --> 16:21.723
Yes. Naked.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.017
- Mmm.
- I was gonna send it to Jay.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.729
You see everything-
the whole body.

16:26.812 --> 16:29.024
I need to sit.
Okay.

16:29.107 --> 16:30.942
Wow, Dad.

16:31.025 --> 16:35.990
So you just got done giving me a lecture on
the importance of locking my bedroom door...

16:36.073 --> 16:41.915
while in my house to retrieve naked pictures
that your wife accidentally sent me.

16:41.998 --> 16:45.919
The irony is just occurring to me.
Mmm. Mmm.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.462
Wow.
What are you doing?

16:47.547 --> 16:50.341
- What I'm doing is deleting it.
- [ Phil] Good for you.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.428
Let's go to Vegas!
[ Gloria ] Ciao!

16:53.511 --> 16:55.305
Do us a favor. No pictures.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.433
Oh, Gloria. Listen.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.478
We do need to talk about the bake sale
at some point. I have some concerns.

17:00.563 --> 17:02.231
Of course you do.
Bye-bye!

17:02.314 --> 17:06.862
[ Sighs ]
What do we do now?

17:06.944 --> 17:09.406
Okay, I'm really afraid of reading
this situation the wrong way,

17:09.489 --> 17:11.660
but I'm 80% sure
you're coming on to me.

17:13.287 --> 17:15.749
Okay, now 40.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.876
Mitchell, we need
to make a decision.

17:19.837 --> 17:22.130
It was the perfect plan.
Turn the rug,

17:22.214 --> 17:24.592
and she wouldn't find
the stain for years.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.471
But we couldn't do it.
We're too honest.

17:27.553 --> 17:30.600
There are certain moments
in life that define you,

17:30.683 --> 17:32.517
and this is
one of those moments.

17:32.602 --> 17:33.978
[ Footsteps ]

17:34.062 --> 17:37.441
[ Sighs ] Guys, I'm so
sorry that took so long.

17:37.525 --> 17:39.902
Oh, my God.
What happened here?

17:41.572 --> 17:43.990
Jackson did it. He grabbed Lily's
strawberry juice and started drinking it.

17:44.074 --> 17:45.951
[ Mitchell ] Before we could stop
him, it was all over everything.

17:46.036 --> 17:47.496
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

17:47.578 --> 17:49.372
We are horrible people.
I'm only following your lead.

17:49.456 --> 17:51.625
Yeah, so close that you stepped on
the back of my shoe.

17:51.709 --> 17:54.296
Come here. Jackson's allergic to strawberries.
His throat will close up.

17:54.378 --> 17:56.923
He can go into anaphylactic shock.
I need to inject him right now.

17:57.007 --> 17:59.802
He seems all right to me.
Maybe just get him some fresh air.

17:59.886 --> 18:01.721
Stop talking!
He really hates this,

18:01.805 --> 18:04.641
so I'm gonna need you to help me
pin down his arms and his legs.

18:04.724 --> 18:08.103
Jackson, Mommy's so sorry to have to do this,
but it's only gonna hurt for a second.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.688
His arms!
Oh!

18:09.773 --> 18:12.526
Okay. All right, here we go.
One. Two-

18:12.610 --> 18:14.195
Wait!
Wait!

18:14.320 --> 18:17.114
Jackson didn't drink the juice.
I stepped on Lily's bag. The juice box fell.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.994
We panicked because we heard you on the phone
and we can't afford Joan Collins's rug!

18:20.077 --> 18:21.912
We are so, so sorry.

18:21.996 --> 18:23.497
We could not feel any worse.

18:27.961 --> 18:30.382
Oh, no. That's bad.

18:30.464 --> 18:32.174
Number 19!

18:32.258 --> 18:35.179
Yeah. Yeah.
Number 19!

18:35.262 --> 18:36.764
Oh, could we have
some napkins, please?

18:36.848 --> 18:39.268
All out of napkins.
Paper towels in bathroom, Mitchell.

18:40.101 --> 18:42.437
He knows your name!

18:42.521 --> 18:44.273
[Claire]
And, uh, I'm just gonna say it.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.026
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

18:47.110 --> 18:49.406
Well, we're not sorry
about what happened.

18:49.531 --> 18:53.910
We're sorry that you saw what happened.
Okay. They get that.

18:53.995 --> 18:57.372
Let's see.
No one wants to see their parents-

18:58.499 --> 19:00.252
Sssssss-

19:00.334 --> 19:03.214
Your sensuality-
not dressed- Oh.

19:03.297 --> 19:06.467
Basically, it's two adults.
Adults.

19:06.552 --> 19:08.219
It's like you're shaking hands-
Mm-hmm.

19:08.304 --> 19:10.973
But you're not using
your hands at all.

19:11.057 --> 19:13.351
I can't handle
a big family talk about this.

19:13.434 --> 19:15.020
We're not gonna have a choice.

19:15.104 --> 19:19.232
When they start talking, just smile and nod
and think about something else.

19:19.318 --> 19:22.236
Yeah, it's easy.
Just like at school.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.990
Yeah.

19:24.072 --> 19:26.701
[Claire] So I guess
what I'm saying here is that...

19:26.783 --> 19:31.080
as you get older
and explore your sexuality,

19:31.165 --> 19:35.587
you will discover that as long as
you are in a committed relationship...

19:35.669 --> 19:38.757
with consenting adults, there's really
nothing to be embarrassed about.

19:38.841 --> 19:41.428
And let's face it. Your mom
can't keep her hands off me...

19:41.510 --> 19:43.388
whenever the gun show
comes to town.

19:43.471 --> 19:46.142
[ Laughing ]
Good one, Dad.

19:46.225 --> 19:49.188
Humor makes
difficult situations easier.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.690
Wow. Really?

19:51.774 --> 19:53.943
Totally.
You talked to us on our level,

19:54.027 --> 19:55.945
but without being condescending.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.657
We did.
All right.

19:58.741 --> 20:01.202
I guess we did.
Huh!

20:01.285 --> 20:02.913
Yay us!

20:02.995 --> 20:05.624
I think we really handled that well.
Me too.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.418
You were excellent.
You were pretty good.

20:08.503 --> 20:10.673
Oh!
Oh.

20:10.755 --> 20:13.384
This is such a weird day.
I know it.

20:13.466 --> 20:15.553
By the way, happy anniversary.

20:15.637 --> 20:18.723
It always is. Mmm.

20:18.806 --> 20:22.102
Hey, Mom, can I get-
Oh, my God! Enough!

20:22.186 --> 20:24.730
[ Groans ]

20:30.238 --> 20:32.825
Hey. What's this?
Your anniversary present.

20:32.907 --> 20:35.326
Aw!
That's very sweet.

20:35.411 --> 20:39.332
My goodness.
What is it?

20:41.126 --> 20:44.587
A door lock. How embarrassing.

20:44.672 --> 20:46.215
Thank you.

20:46.299 --> 20:48.050
We'll use it all the time.
Mmm.

20:48.135 --> 20:49.803
We thought the lock
was a really good idea.

20:51.848 --> 20:54.560
[Alex]
But the problem is, it makes a noise.

20:54.642 --> 20:56.145
[Luke ]
A loud noise.

20:56.227 --> 20:57.730
[ Lock Clicks ]

20:59.524 --> 21:01.025
[ Groans ]

21:01.109 --> 21:03.571
It's hard for me
to look at Dad afterwards.
