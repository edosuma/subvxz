00:02.760 --> 00:04.520
<i>BEEPING</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

00:10.440 --> 00:14.080
<i>We have eyewitness reports</i>
<i>of John Hudson fleeing the scene.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:17.720
<i>It is imperative that we locate</i>
<i>and detain him as soon as possible.</i>

00:18.800 --> 00:20.800
<i>I'm pretty sure my luck</i>
<i>is about to run out.</i>

00:20.800 --> 00:23.360
<i>Tell you what, mate, she's used up</i>
<i>so many of her nine lives,</i>

00:23.360 --> 00:24.880
<i>she's started nicking mine.</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:26.440
<i>What do you think that is?</i>
<i>Stay back.</i>

00:26.440 --> 00:28.080
<i>Have you got my snips, mate?</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:31.760
<i>Lana, please, don't go.</i>
<i>You've gotta trust me.</i>

00:31.760 --> 00:37.160
<i>My job is to keep people safe</i>
<i>and I haven't been able to.</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:40.000
<i>So is that what we are, then? Mates?</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:41.640
<i>I was with someone else.</i>

00:41.640 --> 00:43.920
<i>Does that mean it's over between us?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:47.080
<i>I double checked with</i>
<i>Porton Down about the HMX we found.</i>

00:47.080 --> 00:51.360
<i>There's nothing there.</i>
<i>Just "661142".</i>

00:51.360 --> 00:54.120
<i>That was all that was in the file.</i>
<i>It's been wiped clean.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:56.120
<i>Get a hold of the Labour candidate</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:58.000
<i>and their security.</i>
<i>Tell them we're on our way.</i>

00:58.000 --> 01:01.280
<i>It's the Progressive Alliance</i>
<i>campaign headquarters.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:03.080
<i>Miss Campbell-Khan?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:05.000
<i>We've had intelligence</i>
<i>of a potential attack.</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:06.720
<i>There's an open gas cover</i>
<i>under the boot.</i>

01:06.720 --> 01:08.600
<i>They want this car moved.</i>
<i>This is a set-up.</i>

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
<i>We need to immediately evacuate</i>
<i>the area.</i>

01:10.600 --> 01:13.640
<i>When the car is lifted</i>
<i>onto the ramp, it sets off a charge.</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:15.560
<i>In this case,</i>
<i>it's one that fires a projectile.</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:17.640
<i>It's strong enough</i>
<i>to go straight through the boot</i>

01:17.640 --> 01:20.960
<i>and into the gas pipes. I need</i>
<i>to get into all of these buildings</i>

01:20.960 --> 01:22.920
<i>and we need to check</i>
<i>all the gas meters.</i>

01:22.920 --> 01:26.480
<i>Shit. He's set up a gas explosion</i>
<i>in every building on the street.</i>

01:26.480 --> 01:27.840
<i>I need EXPO support now.</i>

01:37.720 --> 01:39.880
<i>This way, sir.</i>
<i>Can you come this way?</i>

01:39.880 --> 01:41.920
<i>We'll get you back in your home</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

01:41.920 --> 01:44.440
<i>We need to remove your gas meter</i>
<i>for safety.</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:54.880
<i>We need to work faster.</i>
<i>They're on to you.</i>

01:54.880 --> 01:56.840
<i>All residents</i>
<i>are leaving their properties.</i>

02:17.080 --> 02:18.920
<i>Ma'am.</i>
<i>Ma'am.</i>

02:18.920 --> 02:22.080
<i>Sitrep?</i> <i>Er, we've evacuated</i>
<i>everyone within a two-mile radius.</i>

02:22.080 --> 02:24.720
<i>Lana and her team</i>
<i>are dealing with each device now.</i>

02:24.720 --> 02:27.640
<i>Sending in the robot to perform</i>
<i>a controlled explosion on the car.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.480
<i>Campbell-Khan?</i>
<i>Moved to a secure location.</i>

02:30.480 --> 02:33.480
<i>So these devices would have</i>
<i>taken out the entire neighbourhood,</i>

02:33.480 --> 02:36.160
<i>all by us</i>
<i>moving an illegally-parked car.</i>

02:36.160 --> 02:38.120
<i>Ma'am.</i>

02:38.120 --> 02:41.080
<i>Footage from the video doorbell</i>
<i>of campaign HQ.</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:42.360
<i>Progressive Alliance staff</i>

02:42.360 --> 02:44.640
<i>said they saw him</i>
<i>working all the way up the street.</i>

02:44.640 --> 02:46.160
<i>Positive ID on John Hudson?</i>

02:46.160 --> 02:48.560
<i>He wore a mask the entire time</i>
<i>to avoid recognition.</i>

02:48.560 --> 02:50.560
<i>Even when he went inside</i>
<i>to change the gas meters?</i>

02:50.560 --> 02:53.600
<i>He told them it was council</i>
<i>regulations on entering property.</i>

02:53.600 --> 02:57.120
<i>RADIO: 'Central One Four,</i>
<i>the evacuation is complete, over.'</i>

02:57.120 --> 02:58.880
<i>ROBOT RATTLES</i>

03:02.560 --> 03:04.440
<i>Nice and steady. There.</i>

03:04.440 --> 03:06.480
<i>Right, that's all</i>
<i>the gas meters removed.</i>

03:06.480 --> 03:08.160
<i>Good. We're almost ready.</i>

03:08.160 --> 03:10.520
<i>Central Eight Five,</i>
<i>this is EXPO Two.</i>

03:10.520 --> 03:13.120
<i>Buildings are clear.</i>
<i>We're just gonna neutralise the EFP.</i>

03:13.120 --> 03:14.840
<i>Right, I'll be at the van.</i>

03:17.400 --> 03:19.280
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

03:31.360 --> 03:33.080
<i>BEEPING</i>

03:33.080 --> 03:35.040
<i>Stand by.</i>

03:35.040 --> 03:36.240
<i>Firing.</i>

03:55.760 --> 03:57.760
<i>Great work.</i>

03:57.760 --> 03:59.840
<i>This is EXPO Two.</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:01.720
<i>All devices neutralised.</i>
<i>Site secure.</i>

04:01.720 --> 04:03.160
<i>'Central One Five, received.'</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:05.560
<i>Think we've earned a drink, boss.</i>
<i>No?</i>

04:05.560 --> 04:07.640
<i>Yeah. Think you're right.</i>

04:19.840 --> 04:21.520
<i>HE SIGHS</i>
<i>I'm knackered.</i>

04:21.520 --> 04:22.840
<i>Great work, Hass.</i>

04:24.960 --> 04:26.240
<i>You know...</i>

04:27.360 --> 04:31.600
<i>..me and John, we served together,</i>
<i>but we never became mates.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:34.240
<i>You'd think after going through</i>
<i>all that shit,</i>

04:34.240 --> 04:36.160
<i>there'd be a bond, you know?</i>

04:36.160 --> 04:38.520
<i>Look at you and Nut.</i>
<i>You were practically family, right?</i>

04:38.520 --> 04:42.240
<i>Yeah.</i> <i>John never made me</i>
<i>feel part of the team.</i>

04:42.240 --> 04:45.640
<i>Always making a snide comment</i>
<i>about Muslims.</i>

04:45.640 --> 04:47.520
<i>IMITATES JOHN:</i>
<i>"Oh, it's just banter.</i>

04:47.520 --> 04:48.800
<i>"It's just banter, Hass."</i>

04:48.800 --> 04:51.080
<i>Should have kicked</i>
<i>his racist arse then.</i>

04:53.480 --> 04:56.320
<i>Hass, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>It must have been awful, mate.</i>

04:56.320 --> 04:58.120
<i>It's life, innit?</i>

04:58.120 --> 05:00.920
<i>Face this shit all around us.</i>

05:02.680 --> 05:05.240
<i>Don't know why people just</i>
<i>don't open their eyes, you know?</i>

05:05.240 --> 05:07.200
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

05:07.200 --> 05:09.280
<i>I wished I'd have seen it, too.</i>

05:10.520 --> 05:13.120
<i>Wished I could have said</i>
<i>the same to Billy.</i>

05:13.120 --> 05:15.480
<i>Put him straight.</i>

05:15.480 --> 05:17.720
<i>Yeah, you would have.</i>

05:20.680 --> 05:23.680
<i>That was a horrible,</i>
<i>horrible set-up with the meters.</i>

05:23.680 --> 05:26.520
<i>I really don't know</i>
<i>if I would have worked that out.</i>

05:27.760 --> 05:29.600
<i>Nut would have been proud of you.</i>

05:30.880 --> 05:32.640
<i>We all are.</i>

05:34.200 --> 05:36.280
<i>Come here, soppy git.</i>

05:36.280 --> 05:37.880
<i>SHE LAUGHS</i>

05:46.400 --> 05:48.840
<i>Lana, I wanted to say</i>
<i>how helpful you've been.</i>

05:48.840 --> 05:52.560
<i>Your instincts about this case</i>
<i>have been right from the beginning.</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:56.280
<i>You seem to have an understanding</i>
<i>of John's process, his methodology.</i>

05:56.280 --> 05:59.800
<i>I'd like you to work with us.</i>
<i>See if we can predict his next move.</i>

06:01.120 --> 06:03.080
<i>Yeah, anything I can do to help,</i>
<i>Ma'am.</i>

06:03.080 --> 06:04.560
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:05.680 --> 06:07.280
<i>OK, everyone.</i>

06:07.280 --> 06:11.120
<i>I wanna look at the pattern</i>
<i>of the previous Crusader attacks.</i>

06:11.120 --> 06:13.200
<i>Now,</i>
<i>I know we're all working flat out,</i>

06:13.200 --> 06:15.960
<i>but I wanna remind you</i>
<i>that we are running out of time,</i>

06:15.960 --> 06:18.360
<i>before the Commander goes public</i>
<i>with John Hudson</i>

06:18.360 --> 06:20.320
<i>as our number one suspect.</i>

06:20.320 --> 06:22.800
<i>Lana, any initial thoughts?</i>

06:22.800 --> 06:26.840
<i>Er, well, the device at the HQ</i>
<i>was very sophisticated.</i>

06:26.840 --> 06:30.520
<i>I had to piece together all of</i>
<i>the elements to see the final goal.</i>

06:30.520 --> 06:32.080
<i>He relied again</i>
<i>on yet more trickery,</i>

06:32.080 --> 06:36.680
<i>just like we saw at Westhaven</i>
<i>with the secondary light switch,</i>

06:36.680 --> 06:38.920
<i>Amburiq Mosque</i>
<i>with the tilt switch in the bag,</i>

06:38.920 --> 06:42.480
<i>and the pressure plate</i>
<i>under Billy's car seat.</i>

06:42.480 --> 06:44.760
<i>The strategy is hard to predict,</i>

06:44.760 --> 06:46.920
<i>but he does appear</i>
<i>to be leaving a trail.</i>

06:48.200 --> 06:51.640
<i>"1912".</i>
<i>Me and Nut saw this at Westhaven.</i>

06:51.640 --> 06:53.680
<i>We've also investigated that</i>
<i>as a date.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:57.160
<i>We can't see any significance</i>
<i>to 1912 for the far-right.</i>

06:57.160 --> 06:59.680
<i>If you look at the pattern,</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:03.160
<i>the last two attacks have been</i>
<i>directly related to the by-election,</i>

07:03.160 --> 07:06.720
<i>the radio debate and the</i>
<i>Progressive Alliance headquarters.</i>

07:06.720 --> 07:10.160
<i>But neither was successful.</i>
<i>Yeah, we messed up his master plan.</i>

07:10.160 --> 07:14.040
<i>I mean, the gas bomb,</i>
<i>that must have took some planning.</i>

07:14.040 --> 07:16.640
<i>Gaining access</i>
<i>to each individual house,</i>

07:16.640 --> 07:19.800
<i>prepping the charge for the car.</i>
<i>I know his mindset.</i>

07:19.800 --> 07:22.000
<i>He's gonna be more determined now</i>
<i>than ever.</i>

07:22.000 --> 07:24.080
<i>John's gonna want to try</i>
<i>and outwit us.</i>

07:24.080 --> 07:28.440
<i>And he's gonna strike again,</i>
<i>soon and probably bigger than ever.</i>

07:28.440 --> 07:31.520
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>the by-election count tomorrow.</i>

07:31.520 --> 07:34.600
<i>Yeah, the election results.</i>
<i>I think that sounds right.</i>

07:34.600 --> 07:38.680
<i>OK. Let's send a team</i>
<i>down to Deptford Assembly Halls</i>

07:38.680 --> 07:41.080
<i>to sweep ahead of time.</i>
<i>Let's step up security.</i>

07:41.080 --> 07:43.040
<i>Cancel any leave.</i>
<i>I want people on the ground.</i>

07:43.040 --> 07:45.520
<i>TEXT ALERT</i>
<i>OK. Thanks, everyone.</i>

07:45.520 --> 07:47.200
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:51.760
<i>It's John. He's texted.</i>
<i>His phone's back online?</i>

07:51.760 --> 07:54.560
<i>He's saying we need to talk.</i>

07:54.560 --> 07:56.520
<i>OK, let's get the Security Service</i>

07:56.520 --> 07:59.960
<i>to put a geolocation trace</i>
<i>on Hudson's phone now.</i>

07:59.960 --> 08:01.560
<i>Ma'am, what do you want me to do?</i>
<i>Reply?</i>

08:01.560 --> 08:05.000
<i>Yes. Ask him where he is.</i>
<i>Try to keep him online.</i>

08:05.000 --> 08:09.880
<i>We have an urgent trace, 5-8-7.</i>
<i>I'm sending it to you now.</i>

08:09.880 --> 08:11.040
<i>Call him.</i>

08:12.760 --> 08:14.640
<i>OK, confirmation</i>
<i>phone is back online...</i>

08:14.640 --> 08:18.280
<i>RINGING TONE</i>
<i>OK, patching through the location.</i>

08:18.280 --> 08:20.880
<i>'You've reached John Hudson.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.'</i> <i>Nothing.</i>

08:20.880 --> 08:22.240
<i>I'll text him again.</i>

08:22.240 --> 08:25.360
<i>Right, we need that location.</i>
<i>Get on with that, please.</i>

08:25.360 --> 08:27.680
<i>Hang on, he's responding.</i>

08:28.920 --> 08:32.840
<i>He's just sent a number through.</i>

08:32.840 --> 08:34.880
<i>66 11 42.</i>

08:34.880 --> 08:37.480
<i>Let's run that number,</i>
<i>see what comes out.</i> <i>OK, yeah.</i>

08:37.480 --> 08:40.600
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I've heard of that number before.</i>

08:40.600 --> 08:45.920
<i>66 11 42 is the number</i>
<i>from a redacted HMX file.</i>

08:47.160 --> 08:49.760
<i>Sonya called in a favour</i>
<i>from a mate at Porton Down.</i>

08:49.760 --> 08:51.600
<i>Nothing is coming up.</i>

08:51.600 --> 08:53.360
<i>We need that file, Lana.</i>

08:53.360 --> 08:54.880
<i>Yeah, I'll get it.</i>

08:54.880 --> 08:59.480
<i>OK, Ma'am, here we go. We've got him</i>
<i>located outside MOD Steepholm.</i>

08:59.480 --> 09:01.440
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

09:01.440 --> 09:03.440
<i>OK, I'm just getting it.</i>

09:03.440 --> 09:06.240
<i>It's a military ordinance facility</i>
<i>associated with Porton Down.</i>

09:06.240 --> 09:09.480
<i>Looks like a dark site.</i>
<i>Christ, what's he up to?</i>

09:09.480 --> 09:12.160
<i>Screenshot those texts.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:12.160 --> 09:13.800
<i>Let's move.</i>

09:25.280 --> 09:27.400
<i>SIRENS BLARE</i>

09:38.760 --> 09:41.080
<i>Well, I've never heard</i>
<i>of this place.</i> <i>Neither have I.</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:43.240
<i>Is this the only means of entrance?</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:43.240 --> 09:45.760
<i>DI Youngblood, DI Desai, SO15.</i>

09:45.760 --> 09:48.280
<i>Inspector Paul Kirby, Thames Valley.</i>

09:48.280 --> 09:50.280
<i>My team are searching</i>
<i>the entire perimeter.</i>

09:50.280 --> 09:51.800
<i>We're attempting to locate a suspect</i>

09:51.800 --> 09:54.040
<i>and we have evidence</i>
<i>that he might be on the premises.</i>

09:54.040 --> 09:56.920
<i>This is a highly secure MOD base.</i>
<i>We've had no reports of any breach.</i>

09:56.920 --> 09:58.960
<i>You'll have to wait</i>
<i>for the duty officer...</i>

09:58.960 --> 10:01.440
<i>That's unacceptable. We need</i>
<i>to carry out a search urgently.</i>

10:01.440 --> 10:03.720
<i>He will be with you momentarily.</i>
<i>You're wasting my time.</i>

10:12.040 --> 10:14.880
<i>I'm Major Shalfleet. I'm in charge</i>
<i>of security for the base.</i>

10:14.880 --> 10:18.360
<i>Look, I appreciate the urgency,</i>
<i>but it is virtually impossible</i>

10:18.360 --> 10:20.560
<i>for anyone without clearance</i>
<i>to get inside.</i>

10:20.560 --> 10:22.680
<i>Our suspect has military experience.</i>

10:22.680 --> 10:24.720
<i>He might have used that</i>
<i>to gain access.</i>

10:24.720 --> 10:26.280
<i>What might he be looking for here?</i>

10:26.280 --> 10:28.080
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>that's classified information.</i>

10:28.080 --> 10:32.680
<i>Listen, we believe our suspect</i>
<i>is behind the London bomb attacks.</i>

10:32.680 --> 10:35.800
<i>OK? We're dealing</i>
<i>with a time-sensitive situation.</i>

10:37.120 --> 10:42.040
<i>MOD Steepholm is a storage facility</i>
<i>for high-grade military explosives.</i>

10:42.040 --> 10:44.760
<i>You are, of course, free to search</i>
<i>the perimeter of the base</i>

10:44.760 --> 10:47.440
<i>for your suspect,</i>
<i>but any search of the base itself</i>

10:47.440 --> 10:49.640
<i>will have to be undertaken</i>
<i>by the military police.</i>

10:49.640 --> 10:52.000
<i>In that case, I'll need a list</i>
<i>of everything stored here.</i>

10:52.000 --> 10:54.160
<i>We can't take the chance</i>
<i>anything has gone missing.</i>

10:54.160 --> 10:56.840
<i>Everything inside this building</i>
<i>is kept under strict conditions</i>

10:56.840 --> 10:59.320
<i>and at the highest possible</i>
<i>MOD security classification.</i>

10:59.320 --> 11:02.360
<i>Your application for</i>
<i>a search warrant has been received.</i>

11:02.360 --> 11:06.600
<i>As yet, no official approval</i>
<i>has been given by the MOD.</i>

11:07.880 --> 11:09.560
<i>Corporal.</i>
<i>Sir.</i>

11:11.120 --> 11:14.120
<i>Right. So, John must have</i>
<i>a reason to be here.</i>

11:14.120 --> 11:17.280
<i>Have we found out any more</i>
<i>about the numbers that he texted?</i>

11:17.280 --> 11:19.120

34:34.880 --> 34:37.000
<i>So I tapped into that.</i>

34:37.000 --> 34:40.400
<i>I became their leader.</i>
<i>I needed boots on the ground</i>

34:40.400 --> 34:42.920
<i>and I couldn't take the risk</i>
<i>of being caught before I was ready.</i>

34:42.920 --> 34:44.880
<i>So everyone's expendable,</i>
<i>even your mates.</i>

34:44.880 --> 34:46.200
<i>HE SCOFFS</i>
<i>They weren't my mates.</i>

34:46.200 --> 34:48.880
<i>They were racist fucking idiots</i>
<i>and they deserved to die,</i>

34:48.880 --> 34:51.080
<i>but I did give them a purpose, Lana.</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:51.080 --> 34:54.160
<i>They wanted a culture war,</i>
<i>so I gave 'em one.</i>

34:54.160 --> 34:56.320
<i>And maybe their war</i>
<i>and my war were different,</i>

34:56.320 --> 34:59.440
<i>but we all wanted the same thing,</i>
<i>chaos and destruction and terror.</i>

34:59.440 --> 35:02.120
<i>People would finally</i>
<i>start paying attention to us.</i>

35:02.120 --> 35:04.000
<i>Yeah, no, I know. Saw your sign.</i>

35:04.000 --> 35:07.600
<i>You put "1912"</i>
<i>on the wall at Westhaven.</i>

35:07.600 --> 35:09.080
<i>You were trying</i>
<i>to give us a message.</i>

35:09.080 --> 35:10.920
<i>I needed people</i>
<i>to know what happened to me.</i>

35:10.920 --> 35:13.880
<i>They had to start paying attention,</i>
<i>to uncover the truth,</i>

35:13.880 --> 35:15.200
<i>to get me here now.</i>

35:17.240 --> 35:18.760
<i>So, er...</i>

35:19.880 --> 35:21.680
<i>What about... What about Billy?</i>

35:21.680 --> 35:25.440
<i>He, he was, he was a loose cannon.</i>
<i>He was a liability.</i>

35:25.440 --> 35:26.600
<i>He was making you unhappy.</i>

35:26.600 --> 35:29.160
<i>I did it for you.</i>
<i>He was making you unhappy.</i>

35:29.160 --> 35:31.320
<i>He caused you nothing but grief.</i>
<i>You said that!</i>

35:31.320 --> 35:33.840
<i>No, that is not fair.</i>
<i>He was my brother.</i>

35:33.840 --> 35:35.760
<i>Yeah, and I couldn't take</i>
<i>the chance of him</i>

35:35.760 --> 35:37.640
<i>leading you to me</i>
<i>through the Crusaders.</i>

35:40.920 --> 35:44.440
<i>Get back! Move back</i>
<i>against those windows now.</i>

35:44.440 --> 35:45.680
<i>You, move.</i>

35:45.680 --> 35:49.840
<i>SCO19, get back. I can see you.</i>

35:49.840 --> 35:52.600
<i>Right, so, Karl, come on.</i>
<i>What about us?</i>

35:56.280 --> 35:57.760
<i>Were you using me?</i>

35:58.680 --> 36:01.720
<i>No. No, I wasn't using you.</i>
<i>Was it all bullshit?</i>

36:03.120 --> 36:06.080
<i>Do you know what?</i>
<i>I meant every word I said to you.</i>

36:08.160 --> 36:10.160
<i>Every fucking word I meant.</i>

36:14.720 --> 36:17.440
<i>Turn that off. Turn it off now!</i>

36:18.920 --> 36:21.400
<i>He's getting more agitated.</i>
<i>We may need to act soon</i>

36:21.400 --> 36:23.240
<i>to see if we can</i>
<i>minimise casualties.</i>

36:23.240 --> 36:25.840
<i>Central One Five</i>
<i>to Trojan Five Four.</i>

36:25.840 --> 36:28.320
<i>Do you still have visual</i>
<i>from the gallery?</i>

36:28.320 --> 36:31.200
<i>Trojan Five Four.</i>
<i>I still have visual here.</i>

36:31.200 --> 36:33.520
<i>I want ground team on standby.</i>
<i>Prepare for dynamic entry.</i>

36:33.520 --> 36:36.280
<i>Trojan One from Trojan Two Four.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>

36:36.280 --> 36:39.560
<i>'Critical shot may soon be required.</i>

36:39.560 --> 36:41.200
<i>'Hold position.</i>

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
<i>'Prepare for dynamic entry.'</i>

36:45.240 --> 36:47.600
<i>Trojan One, ready to engage.</i>

36:49.080 --> 36:51.240
<i>'Central One Five</i>
<i>to Trojan Five Four.</i>

36:51.240 --> 36:52.640
<i>'Let's get a signal to Lana.</i>

36:52.640 --> 36:56.080
<i>'Critical shot is imminent.'</i>
<i>Trojan Five Four, received.</i>

36:56.080 --> 36:58.640
<i>I started this journey</i>
<i>thinking it was a one-way trip.</i>

36:58.640 --> 37:01.080
<i>You, you made me believe</i>
<i>there could be a future.</i>

37:02.040 --> 37:05.040
<i>I thought you understood.</i>
<i>Thought that we were the same,</i>

37:05.040 --> 37:07.640
<i>trying to get our lives</i>
<i>back together, bit by bit.</i>

37:08.840 --> 37:11.920
<i>We both carry the guilt of trying</i>
<i>to protect people and failing.</i>

37:11.920 --> 37:13.640
<i>Karl, look at me. Listen to me.</i>

37:13.640 --> 37:16.520
<i>Trojan Five Four,</i>
<i>critical shot is ready.</i>

37:16.520 --> 37:19.520
<i>It's not Ayesha that pays. It's</i>
<i>the innocent people that have paid.</i>

37:19.520 --> 37:24.560
<i>It's the kids that have paid.</i>
<i>It's PC Randall, Ali Hussein,</i>

37:24.560 --> 37:26.960
<i>it's... fucking Nut.</i>

37:28.200 --> 37:30.920
<i>If she dies, they're still gonna</i>
<i>cover it up.</i> <i>You know what?</i>

37:30.920 --> 37:34.000
<i>I've run out of options, Lana.</i>
<i>No, you haven't.</i>

37:34.000 --> 37:36.200
<i>The dangerous thing about hope</i>
<i>is that once it's gone,</i>

37:36.200 --> 37:37.680
<i>there's fucking nothing left.</i>

37:37.680 --> 37:40.360
<i>You've still got hope.</i>
<i>I haven't.</i> <i>You have got hope.</i>

37:40.360 --> 37:43.320
<i>You've gotta listen to me.</i>
<i>You have got hope.</i> <i>No. No, Lana.</i>

37:43.320 --> 37:45.640
<i>Don't you dare.</i>
<i>I haven't got anything. I'm sorry.</i>

37:47.480 --> 37:49.880
<i>I'm sorry, Lana.</i>
<i>Karl, please.</i>

37:52.600 --> 37:54.320
<i>GUNSHOT,</i>
<i>SCREAMING</i>

38:01.680 --> 38:04.720
<i>Armed police! Armed police!</i>

38:07.480 --> 38:09.960
<i>EXPO!</i>
<i>MUFFLED COMMAND</i>

38:12.000 --> 38:14.400
<i>Everybody out.</i>
<i>Wash, what happened?</i>

38:17.880 --> 38:19.360
<i>You need to move back. Back!</i>

38:20.720 --> 38:23.160
<i>I just need you to hold on, OK?</i>

38:23.160 --> 38:24.640
<i>Nearly there.</i>

38:27.120 --> 38:29.280
<i>Just keep holding, OK?</i>

38:35.840 --> 38:37.440
<i>Nearly.</i>

38:43.680 --> 38:45.400
<i>We're done.</i>

38:45.400 --> 38:47.160
<i>OK, we're good.</i>

38:50.840 --> 38:52.480
<i>Wash?</i>

38:56.480 --> 39:00.160
<i>Lana.</i>

39:00.160 --> 39:01.800
<i>Wash.</i>

39:06.040 --> 39:07.760
<i>You can let go.</i>

39:11.880 --> 39:14.000
<i>It's over.</i>

39:18.880 --> 39:20.320
<i>It's done.</i>

39:30.200 --> 39:32.480
<i>SIREN BLARES</i>

40:04.120 --> 40:08.080
<i>SHE EXHALES SOFTLY</i>

41:48.640 --> 41:50.960
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

41:50.960 --> 41:52.560
<i>Morning. What time are you in?</i>

41:52.560 --> 41:55.360
<i>Er, 10:30, I think they said.</i>

41:55.360 --> 41:58.280
<i>These preliminary enquiries</i>
<i>can go on for quite a while.</i>

41:58.280 --> 41:59.840
<i>How are you doing?</i>

41:59.840 --> 42:01.720
<i>Yeah, I'm OK.</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:05.400
<i>Getting some support.</i>
<i>Talking helps.</i>

42:05.400 --> 42:07.240
<i>It does.</i>

42:07.240 --> 42:10.240
<i>You should know, we found</i>
<i>Karl Maguire's fingerprints</i>

42:10.240 --> 42:12.040
<i>on John Hudson's mobile device.</i>

42:12.040 --> 42:15.040
<i>We believe that this is evidence</i>
<i>that HE was sending you the texts.</i>

42:15.040 --> 42:17.360
<i>Yeah, and that he manipulated John</i>
<i>into calling a number</i>

42:17.360 --> 42:20.120
<i>that triggered the device</i>
<i>at the university.</i>

42:20.120 --> 42:22.200
<i>Maguire framed him.</i>

42:22.200 --> 42:24.200
<i>What about the suicide attempt?</i>

42:24.200 --> 42:27.800
<i>Set-up. No drugs or alcohol</i>
<i>in his system.</i>

42:27.800 --> 42:29.680
<i>He was knocked out.</i>

42:31.560 --> 42:34.000
<i>I'd better go in. Thom.</i>

42:34.000 --> 42:36.240
<i>Ma'am.</i>

42:36.240 --> 42:38.680
<i>Sam, you're up.</i>

42:38.680 --> 42:40.960
<i>Take care of yourself, OK?</i>

42:40.960 --> 42:42.800
<i>You, too.</i>

42:45.640 --> 42:50.040
<i>Sonya's inside, trying to explain</i>
<i>what a twisted stranded wire is.</i>

42:50.040 --> 42:51.640
<i>Ah, right.</i>

42:55.280 --> 42:57.400
<i>And John Hudson is up and awake now.</i>

42:57.400 --> 43:00.880
<i>He said he was using the A-Z</i>
<i>as a way to track the bomber.</i>

43:02.320 --> 43:05.880
<i>Wanted to prove he should have</i>
<i>been made senior, not you.</i>

43:07.280 --> 43:09.080
<i>His story checks out.</i>

43:13.520 --> 43:16.600
<i>Er, King's Head pub</i>
<i>round the corner.</i>

43:16.600 --> 43:19.600
<i>I'm probably gonna go and sit</i>
<i>in there and have a drink, or ten.</i>

43:19.600 --> 43:22.120
<i>THEY CHUCKLE</i>

43:23.440 --> 43:25.640
<i>Yeah, I might see you in a bit.</i>

43:25.640 --> 43:27.880
<i>OK. Good.</i>

43:27.880 --> 43:30.280
<i>Er, good luck.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

43:55.920 --> 43:58.160
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>What are you still doing here?</i>

43:58.160 --> 44:00.080
<i>Well, that's no way to speak</i>
<i>to someone</i>

44:00.080 --> 44:02.040
<i>who brought you coffee</i>
<i>and a doughnut.</i>

44:02.040 --> 44:04.160
<i>Thanks, Sonya.</i>

44:04.160 --> 44:06.080
<i>Oh, half a doughnut.</i>

44:06.080 --> 44:07.920
<i>Well, I have been here a while.</i>

44:09.560 --> 44:12.760
<i>How you doing?</i>
<i>Can't imagine how you're feeling.</i>

44:12.760 --> 44:15.240
<i>Of all the people to trust</i>
<i>it was...</i>

44:17.640 --> 44:19.400
<i>After Nut died...</i>

44:20.880 --> 44:23.280
<i>..I was lost,</i>
<i>and that's where I ended up.</i>

44:24.800 --> 44:28.760
<i>I thought me and Karl had something</i>
<i>in common, same experiences.</i>

44:28.760 --> 44:33.600
<i>He did a number on you, on everyone.</i>
<i>There's no shame in it.</i>

44:35.160 --> 44:38.240
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>What for?</i>

44:38.240 --> 44:40.800
<i>Answering the door at 3am.</i>

44:42.760 --> 44:44.560
<i>Having my back.</i>

44:45.840 --> 44:48.720
<i>Well, any time, you know that. Hey.</i>

44:50.680 --> 44:52.360
<i>So what now?</i>

44:53.720 --> 44:55.560
<i>Pub?</i>
<i>Plan.</i>
