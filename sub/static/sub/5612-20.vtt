WEBVTT

00:00.964 --> 00:02.297
Listen up, everyone.

00:02.298 --> 00:04.332
While Captain Holt's out of town
at his conference,

00:04.333 --> 00:06.635
I'm in charge,
which means, Jake,

00:06.636 --> 00:08.337
I order you to throw out
that gingerbread house.

00:08.338 --> 00:09.805
- It's from Christmas.
- Fine

00:09.806 --> 00:12.107
But you're gonna be leaving
a lot of ants with no home.

00:12.141 --> 00:15.610
Check it out, losers.
Guess who got their dealer!

00:15.645 --> 00:17.212
Nice!
How'd it go down?

00:17.246 --> 00:18.614
We chased him
through a subway tunnel,

00:18.648 --> 00:20.890
back up through the storm drain,
Adrian and I got engaged,

00:20.917 --> 00:24.853
and then we busted him with a
half kilo of coke in his sock.

00:24.854 --> 00:26.455
Wait, wait, wait.

00:26.456 --> 00:28.357
- What'd you just say?
- It was in his sock.

00:28.358 --> 00:31.735
These dummies, they never think
we're gonna check their socks.

00:31.761 --> 00:34.571
No, before that, weirdo.
The getting engaged part?

00:34.597 --> 00:35.664
Oh, yeah.
We got engaged.

00:35.698 --> 00:37.265
- Engaged engaged?
- Yeah.

00:37.266 --> 00:38.600
- As in, to be wed?
- Yeah.

00:38.635 --> 00:39.901
Seriously?
Together: Yeah.

00:39.902 --> 00:41.970
Amazing!
We wants deets.

00:42.005 --> 00:43.872
Tell us everything!

00:43.873 --> 00:45.273
I don't want to toot
my own horn or anything,

00:45.308 --> 00:47.909
but it was super romantic.

Jake, can I talk to you about
my wedding for a second?

01:19.575 --> 01:20.876
Need help choosing a dress?

01:20.877 --> 01:22.778
Big puffy bow in the back,
can't go wrong.

01:22.812 --> 01:24.146
No to all of that.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.981
Look, Adrian is about to ask you
to be his best man.

01:25.982 --> 01:28.317
I need you to say yes
and I need you to act surprised.

01:28.318 --> 01:31.019
No problem.
Check this out.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.656
[stammering?]
What? What?

01:34.691 --> 01:36.458
Best... best man?

01:36.459 --> 01:38.026
- All right, I'll work on it.
- Okay.

01:38.061 --> 01:40.028
Sarge does not approve
of the wedding,

01:40.063 --> 01:41.513
and honestly, it is killing me.

01:41.531 --> 01:42.864
I'm sure you're just
reading into it.

01:42.865 --> 01:44.232
No.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.267
What are you doing?

01:45.268 --> 01:46.601
Pimento is nuts!

01:46.636 --> 01:48.704
Ah, so not
reading into it at all.

01:48.705 --> 01:50.606
He thinks we're rushing
into things, but we're not.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.873
I love Adrian.

01:51.874 --> 01:53.875
Every time I see him,
my heart just explodes.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.178
Wow, that's, like, some
Lionel Ritchie-grade love stuff.

01:56.212 --> 01:57.679
Anyway, I think Sarge
would like him

01:57.714 --> 01:59.681
if he actually got to know him,
so during the bachelor party,

01:59.716 --> 02:01.658
I need you to show him
the real Adrian.

02:01.684 --> 02:03.518
Rosa Diaz, I promise you this.

02:03.519 --> 02:05.153
I will make sure
Sarge loves him.

02:05.188 --> 02:07.022
Great.
Crap, here comes Adrian.

02:07.023 --> 02:08.323
- You never saw me.
- All right.

02:08.324 --> 02:09.625
Act surprised.

02:09.658 --> 02:12.194
Hey, Jake, come here.
I got a question for you.

02:12.195 --> 02:13.895
[coughs]
Sure.

02:13.896 --> 02:15.364
Oh, that's very close
for a question.

02:15.365 --> 02:20.335
Jake Peralta, will you do me
the honor of being my best man?

02:20.370 --> 02:21.770
Best man?

02:21.771 --> 02:24.639
Adrian, this is all so sudden!

02:24.641 --> 02:26.108
- Rosa told you?
- Yeah.

02:26.109 --> 02:28.143
- But I would be honored.
- Thank God.

02:28.144 --> 02:29.645
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Oh, you don't have to.

02:29.679 --> 02:31.580
- Already did it.
- That seals it.

02:31.614 --> 02:33.415
So who you thinking about
inviting to the bachelor party?

02:33.416 --> 02:36.852
Maybe, like, Terry,
or, I don't know, Terry's great.

02:36.853 --> 02:39.621
Or probably Terry is available,
we could ask him.

02:39.656 --> 02:41.156
Sure, nah, I was thinking
all the guys from work.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.358
Except Chuck.
Rosa called dibs on him.

02:43.393 --> 02:47.062
Maid of honor?
Yes, a million times, yes!

02:47.096 --> 02:48.764
[gasps]
It would be an honor.

02:48.765 --> 02:51.433
Oh, my God,
that's why they call it that.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.835
Great, but I specifically
said, "co-maid-of-honor,"

02:53.836 --> 02:57.739
because I am also asking
Amy and Gina.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.107
I guess that's okay,

02:59.142 --> 03:00.876
if you want to water down
your Charles Boyle

03:00.877 --> 03:02.411
with a couple of ice cubes.

03:02.445 --> 03:05.113
Count me in as long
as I get eight plus-ones.

03:05.114 --> 03:07.583
Guys, focus.
We need to start planning.

03:07.584 --> 03:08.951
So when's the wedding?

03:08.985 --> 03:10.819
Next summer,
next fall, next winter?

03:10.853 --> 03:11.820
Next week.

03:11.855 --> 03:13.088
- Next what?
- Next week?

03:13.089 --> 03:14.990
That is not enough time
to plan a bridal shower,

03:14.991 --> 03:16.191
an engagement brunch,

03:16.192 --> 03:18.560
a papier-mâché sculpture
of you two kissing.

03:18.595 --> 03:19.962
Don't worry about that stuff.

03:19.963 --> 03:22.631
The one dumb wedding thing
I've always wanted

03:22.665 --> 03:24.032
was a bachelorette party.

03:24.033 --> 03:25.467
Ah, so, cool, cool, cool.

03:25.501 --> 03:28.136
All the pressure's on that one
event, cool, cool, very cool.

03:28.171 --> 03:30.439
Super excited for the big night.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.241
Well, I'm happy she's excited.

03:32.275 --> 03:34.810
I'm not sleeping
for the next 24 hours.

03:34.811 --> 03:37.779
Amen, sister.
Amen.

03:37.814 --> 03:39.214
All right, gents,

03:39.215 --> 03:41.283
Pimento's bachelor party
is tomorrow night.

03:41.317 --> 03:42.684
I've gotten us a party bus,

03:42.685 --> 03:45.220
reservations
at a delightful steakhouse,

03:45.255 --> 03:48.891
and a DVD copy of "American
Beauty" to watch at midnight.

03:48.892 --> 03:50.726
That last thing
was his only request.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.127
I'm not sure
if it's his favorite movie

03:52.128 --> 03:53.462
or if he's just never seen it.

03:53.488 --> 03:55.438
I'm surprised he didn't
want us all to get drunk

03:55.465 --> 03:56.999
and slash each other
with machetes.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.134
He's not exactly stable.

03:59.135 --> 04:01.303
Die, bug!
[shouting]

04:01.337 --> 04:05.440
Oh, no, he's dead.
Oh, what have I done?

04:05.475 --> 04:06.908
That was 18 days ago.

04:06.943 --> 04:08.310
He's getting saner
by the minute.

04:08.311 --> 04:10.245
In a month, he'll basically
just be Frasier.

04:10.246 --> 04:11.813
Don't use Frasier's name
in vain.

04:11.848 --> 04:13.148
- Copy that.
- Yeah, Sarge.

04:13.149 --> 04:15.117
If Jake wants to pay for us
to have a fun night out,

04:15.118 --> 04:16.385
let's not stop him.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.753
I'm not paying for it.
We're splitting it.

04:17.754 --> 04:19.462
Well, then, I'm with Terry.
This wedding's a sham.

04:19.488 --> 04:20.964
I'm looking out for Rosa,

04:20.990 --> 04:22.891
like I'd look out for
anyone in my squad.

04:22.926 --> 04:24.126
I get it, but you're
just saying that

04:24.127 --> 04:25.761
'cause you don't know
the real Adrian.

04:25.762 --> 04:27.930
And this bachelor party
is gonna change all that.

04:27.964 --> 04:30.098
We're gonna eat steaks,
we're gonna smoke cigars.

04:30.099 --> 04:31.333
We're gonna look
at naked ladies.

04:31.334 --> 04:33.142
No, Hitchcock,
we're keeping it classy.

04:33.169 --> 04:35.671
- Right, just their boobs.
- No, no boobs.

04:35.672 --> 04:38.206
Look, Sarge, Rosa loves him.

04:38.207 --> 04:39.983
Will you at least promise me
you'll keep an open mind?

04:40.009 --> 04:41.443
Fine, mind open.

04:41.444 --> 04:42.678
But for the record,

04:42.679 --> 04:44.012
I think they're making
a mistake,

04:44.047 --> 04:46.156
and this whole thing
is gonna blow up.

04:46.182 --> 04:49.051
Fun attitude.
Save it for the party bus.

04:49.085 --> 04:52.621
Rosa, we could really use your
input on the bachelorette party.

04:52.622 --> 04:56.325
See, we all have different ideas
and no one is compromising.

04:56.359 --> 04:59.669
I would compromise,
but I refuse to not do mine.

04:59.696 --> 05:01.964
- Whose idea is best?
- Excellent question.

05:01.998 --> 05:05.934
Here's a rundown of mine, the
"elevator pitch," if you will.

05:05.969 --> 05:07.469
Has this ever happened to you?

05:07.503 --> 05:08.704
You show up at
a bachelorette party...

05:08.705 --> 05:10.639
Ding, the elevator doors closed.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.675
No one can hear you.
We cannot hear you.

05:13.676 --> 05:17.913
Now before I tell you my idea,
are you allergic to dolphins?

05:17.914 --> 05:19.548
Why don't we just do
all three parties?

05:19.582 --> 05:21.884
Oh, and then you pick
your favorite at the end.

05:21.885 --> 05:23.218
I.E., mine.

05:23.253 --> 05:24.720
- Sounds good.
- Sounds great.

05:24.754 --> 05:27.530
May the best maid win.

05:27.557 --> 05:29.925
- [hip-hop music playing]
- Wow, how cool is this?

05:29.926 --> 05:32.535
A TV on a bus?
I never thought I'd see that.

05:32.562 --> 05:33.762
Where's the groom already?

05:33.763 --> 05:35.831
Who doesn't show up on time
for their own party?

05:35.832 --> 05:37.132
You mean, besides Gina?

05:37.166 --> 05:39.568
Every year without fail.
Yeah.

05:39.602 --> 05:41.837
Look, you said you'd keep
an open mind for Pimento.

05:41.838 --> 05:43.272
He'll show.
Just give him a shot.

05:43.273 --> 05:44.573
Is everybody comfortable
back there?

05:44.607 --> 05:46.508
Does anybody need any...
aah!

05:46.509 --> 05:47.976
Sir, are you okay?

05:47.977 --> 05:49.311
Hello?

05:49.312 --> 05:51.046
We need to go now!
[engine turns over]

05:51.047 --> 05:52.915
Okay, just keep that mind open.

05:52.916 --> 05:56.084
I'm sure there's a perfectly
stable explanation for this.

05:56.119 --> 05:57.560
Someone's trying to kill me!

05:57.587 --> 06:00.022
Mind closed, Jake!
Mind closed.

06:00.023 --> 06:01.564
[tires squealing]

06:01.591 --> 06:02.899
Yep.

06:11.055 --> 06:12.221
Look, I know you're upset

06:12.222 --> 06:14.023
because Pimento seems
a little amped up...

06:14.058 --> 06:16.025
We were going 90
with the headlights off!

06:16.060 --> 06:18.294
But please just give him
a chance to explain

06:18.295 --> 06:21.464
before getting all angry
and yelling, "Hey, man!"

06:21.498 --> 06:24.000
Hey, man!
What the hell were you doing?

06:24.034 --> 06:26.402
Great, Sarge, can I just talk
to you outside for one moment?

06:26.403 --> 06:28.171
BRB. BRB.
BRB.

06:28.172 --> 06:29.906
Sarge, he's a good cop.

06:29.907 --> 06:32.375
IF you ask him in a supportive,
non-confrontational manner,

06:32.376 --> 06:34.410
he'll give you
a calm, logical answer.

06:34.411 --> 06:36.379
Fine.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.447
Why do you want to know?

06:37.481 --> 06:38.948
Who are you working for?

06:38.983 --> 06:41.417
I will cut you, little man.

06:41.418 --> 06:42.752
Cool.
Hey, uh, Adrian?

06:42.753 --> 06:44.053
Can I borrow you for one sec?

06:44.088 --> 06:45.942
Look, we're all on your side
here, Pimento.

06:45.956 --> 06:48.291
We all want to believe that
you're about to be murdered.

06:48.292 --> 06:49.359
Thanks, man.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.660
But you gotta lay out some facts

06:50.661 --> 06:52.462
and you gotta do it calmly.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.163
Okay, here's everything I know.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.065
- It all started...
- Jake, a word, please.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.500
- What?
- I don't know.

06:57.534 --> 06:59.068
Everybody else
got to go outside.

06:59.103 --> 07:00.803
Get back on the bus!

07:00.804 --> 07:02.839
Sorry.
Adrian, you were saying?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.641
Someone's been following me
for two days.

07:04.642 --> 07:07.443
White guy, svelte,
thick brown hair,

07:07.444 --> 07:09.779
piercing blue eyes.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.347
I don't know,
I guess you'd consider him

07:11.348 --> 07:13.016
classically handsome.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.250
- Is that weird to say?
- No.

07:14.251 --> 07:16.352
I mean, is it?
No, I don't think so.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.322
Anyway, this morning I turned
the tables, followed him home.

07:19.323 --> 07:21.924
We need to go there now,
so we can get the drop on him.

07:21.925 --> 07:24.594
Smart, sane, rational.
Sarge, what do you think?

07:24.628 --> 07:26.296
Fine, we can go.

07:26.297 --> 07:28.484
But only to prove
he's making this all up.

07:28.499 --> 07:29.599
Okay, okay.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.234
The important thing is,
you agreed we can go

07:31.235 --> 07:32.488
and you and Pimento
are best friends now.

07:32.503 --> 07:34.304
Let's do it!

07:34.338 --> 07:36.539
All right, who's up first?

07:36.540 --> 07:40.288
Party number one will be
brought to you by Gina Linetti.

07:40.311 --> 07:42.498
And good times.

07:42.513 --> 07:44.180
Where exactly
are these good times?

07:44.181 --> 07:45.682
Because so far,

07:45.683 --> 07:47.584
the first six seconds of your
party are a big old snooze.

07:47.618 --> 07:49.919
Tonight we will be attending

07:49.920 --> 07:52.822
my nephew Anthony's
13th birthday party.

07:52.823 --> 07:55.358
