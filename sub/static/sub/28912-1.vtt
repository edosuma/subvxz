Michael.

Michael.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.855
I'll be out back.

02:41.536 --> 02:46.708
Hi. I heard you don't feel
like talking, is that right?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.750
Okay, we'll keep it binary.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.210
Yes or no.

Nod for yes, shake for no.

You think you can handle that?

Good.

Now, you handed
Officer Grey a note

03:02.223 --> 03:05.808
claiming to be Donovan Reid.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.644
Is that right?

03:12.233 --> 03:16.444
I've been looking for Donovan
Reid for a long time.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.324
And kid, you're not
what I was expecting.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.580
I see here that you wrote
down your date of birth

03:27.582 --> 03:30.499
but you couldn't remember
your home address.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.419
Is that correct?

03:33.504 --> 03:35.922
Let me explain
something to you, okay.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.759
If you are Donovan Reid,
you're gonna give the Reids

03:39.761 --> 03:42.263
back the life they thought
they had lost forever.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.100
But if you're not.
If you're lying,

03:48.102 --> 03:53.105
if you are not Donovan Reid,
then you're stealing away

03:53.107 --> 03:57.028
any hope that those
people ever had.

03:58.696 --> 04:03.368
So I'm gonna ask you,
are you Donovan Reid?

guys can come on in.

No question, that's my son.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.081
Hank, I told you
we're not sure.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.374
I'm sure.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.501
I still think we
should get a DNA test.

you something to eat?

06:47.198 --> 06:48.656
How about a waffle?

06:48.658 --> 06:51.035
I made some yesterday,
I think I have some batter left.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.199
It's been sudden.

07:31.367 --> 07:35.163
Like I need to tell you.
But I promise you nothing,

You didn't talk to any
strangers, did you Michael?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.563

going out front.

to push me under the water.
