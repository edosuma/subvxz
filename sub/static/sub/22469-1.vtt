When you two compete,
it gets a little, uh...

01:01.996 --> 01:03.195
Intense.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.197
Are you kiddin'?
We love game night.

Wow. How much?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.317
The price is free.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.554
But the cost is beyond
your mortal reckoning.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.688
It's free?

01:29.723 --> 01:32.858
Free to take.
But a curse upon your soul.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.960
But, free?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.628
(STAMMERS) Yes.

Why are we fighting?

09:49.489 --> 09:50.956
This isn't fun at all anymore.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.123
What are you doing?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.992
Isn't this exactly
what you wanted?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.760
To be a winner.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.362
That means everyone
else loses.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.697
Forever!

09:59.967 --> 10:01.733
What's this? A victory hug?

10:01.802 --> 10:04.402
No, little bro. Our friends
were right, all along.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.771
We do get too competitive.
Mostly me.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.841
But we forgot games are about
having fun with each other.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.943
How about we win
this one together?

10:12.012 --> 10:13.178
Really?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.380
No! That's not how this works!

10:15.415 --> 10:18.049
The game can only have
one winner.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.051
I finally get to win.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.586
With you, sis.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.189
Stop, you dummies.
You're breaking the game.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.491
Someone must lose.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.994
-Well, we're
both winning. Yeah.
-So...

10:29.930 --> 10:31.730
So, you mean, I'm the loser?

10:31.765 --> 10:32.998
(BELL DONGS)

10:33.033 --> 10:36.267
(SCREAMING) No, why?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.077
Princess, what happened?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.912
We won. Whoo-hoo!

10:47.948 --> 10:49.614
And so did friendship.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.116
And we learned our lesson.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.718
We're not gonna get
competitive anymore.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.121
No, I mean.
Why are you so

10:57.591 --> 10:58.723
Oopsie.
