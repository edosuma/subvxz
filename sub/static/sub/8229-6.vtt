How do traffic jams

Apparently.
Let's test it.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.166
Totally.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.232
Europeans
love their roundabouts.

17:52.233 --> 17:56.466
But Adam and Jamie want to know,
are they a triumph of efficiency

17:56.467 --> 17:59.732
or, compared to the good 'ol
American 4-way,

17:59.733 --> 18:02.432
a catastrophic circus
of congestion?

18:02.433 --> 18:06.632
So, we're gonna set 'em both up
and run 'em through their paces

18:06.633 --> 18:09.199
and see which one
comes out on top.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.799
Narrator:
It's as simple as that.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.666
They'll mark out a
4-way intersection

18:15.733 --> 18:16.932
Whoo!

18:16.933 --> 18:19.566

compare the efficiency...

I've reached my peak laziness.

Of traffic flow

18:23.467 --> 18:25.899
between the two systems

18:25.900 --> 18:27.932
For a little added realism,
we've decided

18:27.933 --> 18:30.966
to give each of the four streets
in our intersection a real name.

18:30.967 --> 18:35.466
There's plausible parkway,
jato drive, boom boom boulevard,

18:35.467 --> 18:39.432
and then there's my personal
favorite, c4 Avenue.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.132
Well,
we've got our course set up,

18:41.133 --> 18:43.499
and except
for all the barriers and cones,

18:43.500 --> 18:46.132
as you can see,
it's a pretty normal 4-way stop.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.532
So, how's this gonna work?

18:47.533 --> 18:49.866
Well, our drivers
are gonna be driving up

18:49.867 --> 18:51.566
to one of these four stop signs.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.599
And so, of course, they're going
to be lawfully stopping.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.566
At each of our stop signs,
we're gonna have an operator

18:57.567 --> 18:59.099
operating
one of these flip cards,

18:59.100 --> 19:01.232
which will direct our drivers

19:01.233 --> 19:03.366
either right, left,
or straight ahead.

19:03.367 --> 19:04.699
No u-turns.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.066
And every time somebody drives
through the intersection,

19:07.067 --> 19:09.800
I'll be counting it
with this handy little clicker.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.499
And after a measured
period of time,

19:12.500 --> 19:13.799
we'll see how many cars

19:13.800 --> 19:17.066
were able to make it through
our 4-way stop safely.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.532
Our first test
is gonna run for 15 minutes.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.066

Okay, we're up to 123.

with little or no waiting time,

it seems like the American way
is as good as it gets.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.632

it works pretty well, actually,

from where I'm standing.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.666
You know, it's efficient.

19:54.667 --> 19:58.066
Seems like I'm seeing
the same people over and over.

19:58.067 --> 20:02.166
And they don't spend a whole lot
of time in the intersection.

the end of this test.

at the intersection.

but i think he gave me deference
because, well, I'm the host.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.666
I think
this is an excellent metric,

20:35.667 --> 20:37.032
but just to make sure,

20:37.033 --> 20:38.632
we're gonna run this test
one more time

and average the results.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.966

is clearly getting to Adam.

What we need now is a summary.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.299
Adam?

21:11.300 --> 21:16.099
We had an average of 385 drivers
cross through this intersection

21:16.100 --> 21:17.699

21:17.700 --> 21:20.066
That's more than one car

of throughput

But before we proceed
all the way

21:25.167 --> 21:27.066
to resetting everything
for a roundabout,

21:27.067 --> 21:29.732
it occurs to me
that there is one more way

21:29.733 --> 21:33.199
that a 4-way intersection
can work... without stop signs.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.232
if a former member
of the village people

21:48.233 --> 21:52.066
can move traffic faster
than self-governed stop signs.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.666
Jamie: There are a number
of different ways

21:53.667 --> 21:54.966

21:54.967 --> 21:56.899
There are stop signs,
there are roundabouts,

21:56.900 --> 21:58.866
but then there are also
traffic lights.

This is my favorite test
of this episode so far.

22:01.267 --> 22:03.199

And so we want to know

22:03.200 --> 22:06.266
if the decision-making
that the traffic cop is doing

22:06.267 --> 22:07.966
is more efficient and quicker

22:07.967 --> 22:10.499
at getting people
through an intersection

22:10.500 --> 22:11.966
than the decision-making

22:11.967 --> 22:15.432
that all those individual
drivers can do by themselves.

is a resounding no.

is all pain for no real gain.

with ideal congested conditions,

22:52.267 --> 22:55.332

a 50-mile rush-hour route

traffic black spots

in the country...
The California interstate 580.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.399
Plus, they're taking luck
out of the equation

23:06.400 --> 23:09.066
by upping the Lane-staying ante.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.966
So,
today is the final experiment

23:10.967 --> 23:13.632
for our weaving
versus staying-in-one-Lane myth.

23:13.633 --> 23:14.966
But there's gonna be
a difference,

23:14.967 --> 23:17.732
and that difference is
we're gonna fill each Lane

23:17.733 --> 23:21.232
with a car marked 1 through 4
to correspond to their Lane.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.232

will be the weaving driver.

a comprehensive comparison

all four lanes on the highway...

will be earned the hard way.

right, passed me, and he's gone.

about switching lanes.

speeding up again.

are the others?

is significantly larger.

25% slower than Tory,

26:52.800 --> 26:56.332
the Lane-staying myth
looks down and out.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.299
So, where do we stand with
the stick-or-weave dilemma?

26:59.300 --> 27:01.666
Well, with every single test
we've done,

27:01.667 --> 27:04.466
the Weaver will beat
the person staying in one Lane

27:04.467 --> 27:05.966
every single time.

27:05.967 --> 27:08.899
In test 1 in traffic
that wasn't that heavy,

27:08.900 --> 27:11.366
the Lane-sticker lost
by around 2%.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.066
And in the ultimate test,

27:13.067 --> 27:16.532
all the Lane-stickers lost
by anywhere from 4% to 25%.

27:16.533 --> 27:18.132
So, what does that mean?

27:18.133 --> 27:20.432
Well, the myth
that staying in one Lane

27:20.433 --> 27:23.432
will get you to your destination
in the same time as weaving

27:23.433 --> 27:24.466
is busted.

27:24.467 --> 27:26.466
Weaving will get you there
faster,

27:26.467 --> 27:29.066
but just barely,
and it's not that safe.

27:29.067 --> 27:31.566
Narrator:
And that's a crucial caveat,

27:31.567 --> 27:33.366
especially for Grant,

27:33.367 --> 27:36.199
who's reconsidering his life
as a Lane-changer.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.266
Hi.

27:37.267 --> 27:39.366
My name is Grant,
and I'm a Lane-Weaver.

27:39.367 --> 27:42.066
Look, i only do it when
I'm late, which is fairly often.

27:42.067 --> 27:45.199
While kari was freaked out,
one thing is clear,

27:45.200 --> 27:48.432
and that is this technique
does save you time.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.966
But when you factor in
the stress,

27:50.967 --> 27:53.432
the concentration required,
the potential hazards,

27:53.433 --> 27:58.066
it's really not worth it for,
what, a few minutes' savings?

27:58.067 --> 27:59.799

28:31.767 --> 28:33.766
This one is another classic.

less than 400 miles,

28:36.433 --> 28:38.699

to Los Angeles,

28:38.700 --> 28:42.766

to drive than it is to fly.

28:42.767 --> 28:43.932
No way.
I can see it.

28:43.933 --> 28:45.732
I mean, you have to
get to the airport

28:45.733 --> 28:47.632
an hour and a half
ahead of your flight,

28:47.633 --> 28:49.766

your bag, get through security,

28:49.767 --> 28:52.232
and then, on the other end,
go and rent a car.

28:52.233 --> 28:53.532

28:53.533 --> 28:56.066

faster than flying.

of hare versus tortoise

29:09.500 --> 29:12.066

can't compete

it's a pre-dawn showdown.

that it's faster to drive

that's less than 400 miles.

Tory's confident

29:51.067 --> 29:52.799

29:52.800 --> 29:56.732
will be traveling approximately
430 miles an hour faster,

of a container in the car?
