WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.705
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG, friends. We left Jane
dating Rafael in secret.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.707
See, this way they could
figure out their relationship

00:06.740 --> 00:09.243
without all
the outside pressure.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.312
And speaking of pressure,
Petra asked Jane

00:11.345 --> 00:12.613
to ghostwrite
her lifestyle book.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.715
And on the career front,

00:14.748 --> 00:17.185
Rogelio's public feud
with River Fields

00:17.218 --> 00:19.053
left him closer than ever
to achieving his goal.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.055
The studio just offered
to greenlight

00:21.089 --> 00:22.723
the American version
of Santos,

00:22.756 --> 00:26.627
if I can get River Fields
to costar with me.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.597
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Xiomara's career goals,
however, were less certain.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.266
I-It's kind of late to start
thinking about a new career.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.468
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And Rafael-- well, he lost
all his money

00:34.502 --> 00:37.071
and had to bartend
at his own hotel.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.340
So, yeah, he was
pretty bummed about it.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.808
Especially because he could
have gotten his money back

00:40.841 --> 00:43.377
from his sister,
only she'd taken off.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.479
And Petra could have
stopped her.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.548
How long did you leave my sister
in an institution

00:47.581 --> 00:49.283
knowing she wasn't
hallucinating?

00:49.317 --> 00:51.652
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But Petra had bigger problems.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.222
See, she was a person of
interest in her sister's death.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.091
And holy hell!
Her lawyer, Jane,

00:57.125 --> 00:59.360
aka J.R.,
was working against her.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.396
And, yes, I said, "was,"
because she changed her mind

01:02.430 --> 01:04.765
once she thought Petra
was innocent.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.700
Oh. And it seemed
Petra was starting

01:06.734 --> 01:08.336
to feel something new, too.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.204
And, whoa, it may have
been a dream,

01:10.238 --> 01:11.705
but the nightmare was real.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.741
Someone was out to screw Petra.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.677
I know. Straight
out of a telenovela, right?

01:16.710 --> 01:19.580
Which this is, after all.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.183
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:22.216 --> 01:24.718
was 28 years
and seven months old...

01:24.752 --> 01:28.122
she started
acting a little... strange.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.423
REGINA:
Jane.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.591
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.859
Totally fine.
Oh.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.494
I was just restocking
and I accidentally

01:33.527 --> 01:35.163
broke a few glasses.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.730
I'll grab the broom.
I'll clean it up.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.132
Don't worry about it.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.236
Abuela. You're home early.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.606
I just went for a run.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.244
Yeah. It was-it was

01:50.278 --> 01:52.146
really freeing, to be honest.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.152
Jane.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.887
What are you doing
in the supply closet?

01:59.920 --> 02:03.457
I was just looking for some,
uh, toilet paper.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.694
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To reframe this,
Jane wasn't going crazy.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.197
I'll clean it up.
Don't worry about it.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.701
It was-it was really freeing,
to be honest.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.870
Jane.
Huh?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.539
What are you doing
in the supply closet?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.274
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So, yes, friends,

02:20.308 --> 02:21.409
as you can see,

02:21.442 --> 02:24.545
context is everything.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.614
Which brings us here, now.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.582
Excuse me.
Are

02:28.616 --> 02:30.551
I certainly am, sir.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.453
Yeah, my steak is cold.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.589
Well, I will take it back right
away and comp your whole meal.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.225
And nice shirt.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.860
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, seems like Jane

02:39.893 --> 02:41.329
is really loving her job
these days.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.364
Oh!

02:43.397 --> 02:45.433
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But, like I told you,

02:45.466 --> 02:46.734
context is everything.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.203
My last day at The Marbella.
This is so sad.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.871
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sad. Right.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.341
But I'm leaving you in really
good hands with Regina.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.575
PETRA:
Hey. What's going on here?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.510
SONIA:
We're having a party for Jane.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.878
Since she sold her book.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.380
My book.
Our book.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.416
I mean, yes, sure,
ours, of course.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.984
Jane's my ghostwriter.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.686
Well, congrats to you both.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.954
Thank you so much.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.223
You're welcome.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.472
RAFAEL:
I missed it? Damn.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.906
I couldn't get
away from the bar.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.608
Why is it that when
you're in a hurry

03:27.641 --> 03:29.443
everybody suddenly wants
drinks involving a blender?

03:29.477 --> 03:32.946
It's okay. We can
celebrate privately later.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.983
Or... how about now?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.651
Meet you in our usual spot?

03:37.685 --> 03:38.986
REGINA:
Rafael, your break's

03:39.019 --> 03:40.654
not for another 30 and there's

03:40.688 --> 03:43.257
a pack of kids out there
screaming for frozen daiquiris.

03:43.291 --> 03:46.294
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
Wow, look at Regina,
coming in hot and hard.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.895
I have to head out, anyway.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.899
ROGELIO:
This isn't my dream.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.702
This is America's dream.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.837
I mean it, Teri Hatcher.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.706
You're perfect for the role.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.708
Your wit, your talent,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.344
your youthful appearance
that rivals only mine.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.513
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To remind you,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.515
Rogelio had recently been
offered a chance to remake

04:07.548 --> 04:09.950
The Passions of Santos
for an American audience.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.885
I love you for this.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.488
The studio
loves you for this.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.358
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To be clear: the studio
loved River Fields...

04:17.391 --> 04:19.393
I can't even fathom
them wanting anybody else.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.061
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
...who Rogelio hated.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.563
Think it over,
Teri Hatcher.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.831
And remember,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.700
you are my
number-one choice.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.302
Bye.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.037
I thought your
number-one choice

04:30.070 --> 04:31.939
was Eva Longoria.
Don't say it.
It's too painful.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.309
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Rogelio's Holy Grail.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.579
I thought I had a way
to get in touch with her

04:38.612 --> 04:39.980
through my ex-hairdresser

04:40.013 --> 04:42.516
who knows her third
assistant, but no luck.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.453
She's so evasive.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.721
So I'm exploring
other leading ladies,

04:47.755 --> 04:50.524
all of whom I will passionately
pitch to the studio tomorrow

04:50.558 --> 04:52.092
to get them off River Fields.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.728
Because there's
no way in hell

04:54.762 --> 04:58.399
I'm working with that
nine-toed she-devil.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.468
Well, after what happened,
I'm sure

05:00.501 --> 05:02.736
she's not too psyched
to work with you either.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.904
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To remind you:

05:03.937 --> 05:05.539
Attack her.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.343
The point is I have a
big meeting tomorrow,

05:09.377 --> 05:12.613
and I was wondering
if you'd watch Baby.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.914
Just this once.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.650
This is such an important
meeting. Please.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.052
Fine.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.688
Just this once.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
Thank you, Xiomara.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.959
You're the best
woman in the world.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.095
And with your help,
I will vanquish

05:28.128 --> 05:30.063
the worst woman
in the world.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.099
Oh, that's Brad.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.534
Huh?
He teaches the 3:00 p.m.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.637
hip-hop class,
so we're carpooling.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.774
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, hello, Brad.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.910
Hello, Nicollette Sheridan.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.378
Let me just say, you are

05:44.412 --> 05:46.980
my number-one choice
for this role.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.384
So, listen.
I've read the first chapter.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.687
And I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

05:53.721 --> 05:55.923
I have no notes.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.124
What?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.692
I know.
It's very unlike me.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.060
But I-I actually thought

06:00.093 --> 06:02.896
it was quite well done.
So bravo.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.999
This is amazing.
Wow.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.835
I-I guess I'll just dive into
the next chapter.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.404
Ooh, which means
I'm ahead of schedule.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.972
And my schedule
is very aggressive.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.642
Did my daddy send you a picture?

06:14.675 --> 06:15.909
I want to see.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.144
JANE:
Oh, no. Sorry.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.512
I have to tell your daddy

06:18.546 --> 06:19.947
that it is rude
to text during brunch.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.115
When is he gonna
come back to brunch?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.452
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whenever he forgives Petra
for lying,

06:24.485 --> 06:25.953
keeping his sister
in a mental hospital,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.555
and leaving him with nothing.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.657
Soon. He's just...
very busy right now.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.158
Mmm.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Saved by the doorbell.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.128
Maybe that's him.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or not.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.730
Petra Solano. You're under
arrest for the murder

06:36.764 --> 06:38.899
of your sister, Anezka
Archuletta. You have the right

06:38.932 --> 06:41.435
to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used
What are you doing? What...

06:41.469 --> 06:42.836
against you in the court of law.
I don't understand.
What is happening?

06:45.205 --> 06:48.041
Jane.
Yes?
Yes?

06:48.075 --> 06:51.545
Oh, you must be
the other Jane.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.881
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Other Jane. Who's story
do you think this is?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.449
I

06:55.483 --> 06:56.717
Petra's lawyer,
Jane Ramos.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.951
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aka Other Jane.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.053
You're not at all
what I pictured.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.122
Well, whoever
you are,

07:02.155 --> 07:04.725
Petra Solano is ready
to be released on bail.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.231
Oh, Petra.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.866
Are you okay?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.836
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
Okay.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.838
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, the moment

07:17.871 --> 07:19.640
Petra had been dreaming of.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.984
Thank you for
bailing me out, J.R.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.754
This is absolutely ridiculous.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
I didn't do anything.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.624
They found the
missing screws

07:36.657 --> 07:38.158
from the balcony
in your office.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.628
What?

07:40.661 --> 07:41.895
Well, someone
must have planted them.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.264
My mother. It had to be.
I agree.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.633
And I have a call
in to the D.A.'s office.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.537
I'm going to get you off, Petra.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.039
*

07:54.942 --> 07:57.611
Yeah, well,
I just want to get out of here.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.150
The, uh, twins just went down.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.818
Good. Thank you.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.654
Are you okay?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.155
I've survived baseless

08:08.188 --> 08:10.157
murder charges before, Rafael.
I don't need your pity.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.225
I was just asking.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.994
I should take this.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.996
Hello.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.731
Be nice.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.733
I was trying. She's the
one that snapped at me.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.234
Try harder.
She was just arrested.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.572
It's not all about you, Rafael.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.708
PETRA:
That was my publisher.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.610
They got wind
of the murder charge,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.278
and now they're putting
a pin in my lifestyle book.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.980
Which means it's cancelled.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.815
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Remember, Jane,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.316
it's not all about you.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.118
You okay?
Of course.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.888
It's just a book. My whole life
is not riding on it.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.222
Right. Totally.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.091
It's just a book.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.565
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't look so glum, Jane.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.166
You may not have a book
to ghostwrite or a salary,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.602
but at least you still have...

08:54.635 --> 08:55.969
a dentist appointment.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.006
Hi, Mr. Sweetface.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.308
How are you?
Uh, good talk.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.711
XIOMARA:
Well, I know I don't want
to work in an office.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.978
JANE:
No, you don't.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.246
RAFAEL:
What's going on here?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.581
Welcome to the Villanueva
job fair.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.782
We are on the hunt.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.818
Mmm. Maybe I can be
a party planner.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.252
No way. You hated
planning your wedding.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.821
You're right. Forget it.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.955
Are you looking for a new job,
too, Rogelio?

09:14.988 --> 09:15.956
ROGELIO:
Oh, no, no. Not for me.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.858
But for an incredibly
lucky woman.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.326
I'm compiling a list

09:19.359 --> 09:21.862
of, uh, leading ladies
ranked by availability,

09:21.895 --> 09:24.264
tolerability, and whether
their face muscles

09:24.297 --> 09:25.999
can still show emotion.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.935
RAFAEL:
Right. Okay, then.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.737
Hey, you could
just go back

09:29.770 --> 09:31.805
to your job at the Marbella.
And kick out Regina?

09:31.839 --> 09:34.141
No way. Plus, I want
something more stimulating.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.209
That's why ghostwriting
was exciting.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.878
So what are you thinking?
Actually,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.147
maybe going back to teaching
in some capacity.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.683
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. The old adage:

09:42.716 --> 09:45.018
Those who can't
ghostwrite, teach.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.020
I could try high schools again,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.857
or community colleges
or online classes.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.292
I am a
published author.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.028
Oh, and I have to get out
of the Marbella.
Oh, I know what you mean.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.231
If I have to make
another banana daiquiri...

09:58.265 --> 09:59.733
Then get in on the job fair.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.902
You know what?
Okay.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.004
Maybe I'll start
putting out some feelers.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.306
No, don't.
Fillers are a terrible idea.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.909
They have disqualified
half the actresses on my list.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.711
RAFAEL:
Oh, no, no. Feelers.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.179
Like "job feelers."

10:12.212 --> 10:14.414
Oh. Okay, good.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.851
But still don't do anything
to that beautiful face, ever.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.020
Noted.
Except maybe around the eyes.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.321
Okay.
I'm off.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.924
First step
on the teaching train.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.993
Why would you
want to teach?
Temporarily.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.928
Until I get my writing
off the ground.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.663
Yeah, I started
teaching writing

10:29.697 --> 10:31.899
temporarily, too.
25 years ago.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.734
Don't give me that look.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.168
I'm fine.
Instead of seeing myself

10:35.202 --> 10:36.804
as a failed novelist,
I choose to see myself

10:36.837 --> 10:38.939
as a successful teacher.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.941
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A-plus reframing,
Professor Donaldson.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.410
I just need a stimulating
job to tide me over

10:43.443 --> 10:45.012
while I work through
this writer's block.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.014
Well, if you're sure,
I actually know

10:47.047 --> 10:49.016
they're looking for someone
to fill in at Southern Miami.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.784
An old colleague
sent around

10:50.818 --> 10:52.452
an e-mail
asking for recommendations.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.755
That's amazing.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.891
The colleague
is Jonathan Chavez.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.092
Oh.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.193
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As in...

11:02.262 --> 11:03.831
MARLENE:
I mean,

11:03.864 --> 11:05.098
I'm sure he remembers you

11:05.132 --> 11:06.867
because of all the...
You know.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.702
The bibbidi bobbidi.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.971
First of all, there was
no bibbidi bobbidi.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.373
Secondly, no one has
ever called it that.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.875
Then you should
reach out to him.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.977
Unless things went badly
between you two?

11:17.010 --> 11:17.978
You're crying.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.780
No, I'm not crying.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.849
:
I'm not cry...

11:21.882 --> 11:24.752
No, it was totally cool.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.287
Great. Then I'll get you
his new e-mail address.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.892
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. How do you
craft an e-mail

11:31.925 --> 11:34.027
to the guy you almost
lost your virginity to

11:34.061 --> 11:36.764
but instead wound up
just losing your dignity?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.906
Nope.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
No.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.198
RAFAEL:
Too flirty.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.200
It's not flirty.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.202
Yeah, you're using too
many exclamation points.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.071
You're so! Happy!
To hear!

12:18.105 --> 12:19.940
Are you jealous of a guy I
haven't spoken to in four years?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.341
A creepy guy.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.143
He's not creepy.
He wasn't my advisor

12:23.176 --> 12:24.311
when we got together.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.813
And I pursued him, remember?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.247
You're just being
overprotective,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.316
which is sweet, but I really
need to get this done,

12:29.349 --> 12:30.851
so will you please
stop distracting me?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.452
Okay. I was just
coming to tell you

12:32.485 --> 12:34.187
I got an interview for this
commercial real estate gig.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.123
What

12:36.156 --> 12:38.091
Mm-hmm. So how many
exclamation points

12:38.125 --> 12:39.392
are appropriate in
my response e

12:39.426 --> 12:41.261
Oh, at least 15.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.898
You're so! Excited!
About! The job!

12:46.233 --> 12:48.501
MAN:
We need passion. Chemistry.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.337
Heat.
And that's why
we want River.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.272
You guys were
explosive together.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.342
I can assure you I will explode
with any of the ladies

12:55.375 --> 12:57.911
on my carefully curated list.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.547
Any of these women
would be phenomenal

13:00.580 --> 13:03.250
as first ladies to my president.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.353
Way better than River Fields.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.088
Hmm. I don't know. I'm just not

13:08.121 --> 13:10.323
feeling any of these choices.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.925
Well, that's absurd.
I mean,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.827
I have every single Jennifer.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.999
Can you get any of them?
No.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.002
I'm just trying
to get a sense of your taste.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.270
But keep reading.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.272
I can get
the Desperate Housewives.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.406
Except one.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.141
Alfre Woodard? Yeah.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.142
She was unavailable.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.377
Eva Longoria.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.381
Honestly, that's
the first name I've heard

13:34.414 --> 13:36.116
that comes even close to River.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.085
If you could get Eva,

13:38.118 --> 13:40.153
we would go for it.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.389
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of going for it...

13:42.422 --> 13:44.291
Ow! Ooh!

13:44.324 --> 13:46.626
Ow! Ow!
What What happened?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.228
Ooh, I think I pulled a muscle.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.296
Oh, I'm sorry.
No.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.899
Don't ever apologize
for doing that.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.503
XIOMARA:
Hey, Jane, you home?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.538
Um...

13:58.571 --> 14:00.040
Coming!

14:00.073 --> 14:01.975
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Not anymore.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.511
Just stopped by before class.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.579
JANE:
Hey.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.448
Rafael was just, uh, helping me

14:08.481 --> 14:10.383
with, uh, my, um...
Drawers.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.285
Yes, the-the dresser drawers.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.587
Yeah.
They got all messed up,

14:14.621 --> 14:17.057
and I had to force them back in.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.325
What's up with your leg?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.593
Oh, um...

14:20.627 --> 14:22.062
I think I was just
overcompensating

14:22.095 --> 14:23.330
for the leg that I broke,

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
and then I put the pressure
on the other leg

14:25.032 --> 14:26.166
while I was, uh...

14:26.199 --> 14:28.035
fixing those drawers.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.239
So, here's a weird thought.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.443
What do you think
about me going back to school?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.678
Are you serious?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.047
I was just looking
through this catalog,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.181
and there's so much in here

14:41.214 --> 14:43.350
that could be interesting.
Ma.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.484
That's amazing.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.353
I'm just thinking about it.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.021
I've never been a school person.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.422
Well, why don't you pick a class
and ask the professor

14:49.456 --> 14:51.258
if you can sit in?
They let you do that?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.425
Definitely.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.927
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of professors...

14:53.961 --> 14:56.263
Oh, wow.
Chavez replied.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.565
Oh, yeah?
What... what'd he say?

14:58.598 --> 14:59.566
He wants to meet tomorrow.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.201
Hon,
that's great.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.669
RAFAEL: On that note,
I should head to Petra's.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.471
Uh, Jane, thank you
Hmm?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.439
for letting me help
you with your drawers.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.441
See you later.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.210
And be nice to Petra.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.312
She's the mother
of your children, and...

15:12.345 --> 15:13.546
People make mistakes.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.715
And so I just want us
to move past everything.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.350
Because we are family.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.386
Thank you.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.090
I'm pretty rattled, honestly.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.457
What exactly is going on?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.492
It's my mother.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.061
She's framing me. Again.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.296
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or reframing,

15:29.329 --> 15:30.730
as it were.
Why?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.332
I don't know yet.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.501
Do you know where she is?
No, but we're looking.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.369
"We're"?
My lawyer.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.404
You like her?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.377
Look, it doesn't matter
if I like her.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.981
The point is, I trust her
to get me out of this mess.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.516
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A mess, I'll remind you,

15:49.549 --> 15:52.285
J.R. partly created.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.623
What happened?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.992
I have to tell you something.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.128
You're scaring me.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.165
Look...

16:05.198 --> 16:08.268
a long time ago, when
I worked for the D.A.,

16:08.301 --> 16:10.537
I tampered with evidence
to get a client off.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.542
This girl, she shot her abuser.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.310
The system's a joke.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.745
She was gonna get
life in prison.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.713
W-What does this
have to do with me?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.218
A few weeks ago,
I got an e-mail.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.686
Someone knew about it.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.321
Said I had to even the scales,

16:28.355 --> 16:32.192
make sure someone guilty
and rich went to jail.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.495
They threatened
to expose me.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.465
The minute I realized you
didn't kill your sister,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.101
I told them I wanted out.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.503
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, this certainly
reframes everything.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.040
You planted the screws.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.441
No.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.177
I didn't do that, I swear.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
It must have been
the blackmailer.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.481
Your mother, I can only assume.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.184
I've never spoken
with them directly.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.019
They leave me these burner
phones like it's 1996.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.158
Look, this is everything.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.327
Copies of all of
my correspondence.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.828
All of the background
information

17:08.861 --> 17:10.463
they gave me about you.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.134
I'm sorry.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.169
I felt trapped, and...

17:18.405 --> 17:20.373
...I couldn't find a way out.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.644
I'm going to have you disbarred.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.679
Hopefully thrown in prison.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.582
I understand.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.384
But I do want to say:

17:31.418 --> 17:34.321
no one will work harder to
get you out of this than me.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.622
Get out.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.704
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A framed narrative,
you should know,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.340
allows one
to tell multiple stories

17:53.373 --> 17:54.874
within a larger context.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.110
You nervous?
Want me to come with you?

17:57.144 --> 17:59.179
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And yes, I'm showing off

17:59.212 --> 18:00.447
because we're at a college.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.748
Think my mom being there

18:01.781 --> 18:03.250
is gonna make it less
awkward with Chavez?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.784
Go sign up for your class.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.419
Unless you want me
to come with you?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.255
Think my grown-ass daughter
being there

18:08.288 --> 18:10.390
will make me seem less old?
Good point.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.226
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
My point is this
story's framed.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.794
By me, of course.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.264
Which means
you see things in pieces,

18:17.297 --> 18:19.232
not the whole picture.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.502
Which, I suppose,
is also true of life.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.237
Jane. Hi.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.772
H-Hi there.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.674
These are some
of my grad students.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.708
Um, Ben,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.577
Cam, Marissa.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.313
Yeah, Jane was where
you guys are a few years ago,

18:33.346 --> 18:35.548
and she just published
her first novel.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.250
MARISSA:
That's incredible.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.852
It's so nice to meet you.
Wow.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.721
Thanks. Nice to
meet you, too.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.292
So, my famous
ex-student.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.860
Oh, stop.
One barely-selling book.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.462
A published novel?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.931
That is no small feat.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.600
Thank you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.835
And I was really excited
to hear about the job opening.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.537
Especially since I have
a connection on the inside.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.172
Oh, I mean...
No.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.840
I know-I know
what you meant.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.209
I talked to the head

19:02.242 --> 19:03.276
of the department,
Kate Henderson.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.411
Gave her a cheat sheet on you,

19:04.444 --> 19:07.180
and she's interested.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.615
Can you lead a guest
seminar Thursday?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.350
She'd observe,

19:10.383 --> 19:11.418
and we'll take it from there?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.520
As in this Thursday?
Uh, we're, uh...

19:13.553 --> 19:14.621
we're in a bit of a bind.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.889
Not that you're not excellent.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.226
Thursday sounds perfect.
Thank you so much.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.760
My pleasure.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.764
So, um... here's a question.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.500
Um, do we have to disclose

19:27.534 --> 19:28.868
that we had
a personal relationship?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.837
To Henderson?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.539
Like, is there
a university rule

19:32.572 --> 19:36.343
about hiring someone who, um...

19:36.376 --> 19:38.678
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Cried and didn't
sleep with you?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.647
No. Uh, we're fine.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.948
Don't worry.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.850
But you should
get to work

19:43.883 --> 19:44.884
on your seminar.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.918
And if you have questions,

19:45.952 --> 19:47.254
feel free to e-mail or...

19:47.287 --> 19:48.655
KRISHNA:
Call! Line two.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.889
American Bar
Association.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.860
Hello.
Thank you for returning

19:53.893 --> 19:54.994
my call so quickly.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.429
I need to report an attorney

19:56.463 --> 19:57.864
whose gross misconduct

19:57.897 --> 20:00.367
I believe to be grounds
for immediate disbarment.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.235
I have proof
of everything she...

20:02.269 --> 20:03.736
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

20:03.770 --> 20:06.573
that's when Petra
saw the whole picture.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.709
Let me call you back.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.611
My mother doesn't
have a right hand.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.779
And as you can see,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.247
the photographer's
holding the document

20:14.281 --> 20:15.715
in their right hand,
so my mother

20:15.748 --> 20:16.916
is not the one
blackmailing you.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.651
Or she isn't acting alone.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.453
Maybe. Except I still
can't figure out

20:20.487 --> 20:21.888
why she'd
want me in jail.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.690
My mother doesn't do
anything without a reason,

20:23.723 --> 20:25.592
and I'm worthless
to her in jail.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.560
But clearly someone's
trying to frame me,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.629
and you're my best chance
at drawing this person out.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.898
I'll do it.
But I don't trust you.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.500
See my predicament?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.535
So you're going to prove
your loyalty to me.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.036
Since now I know

20:37.069 --> 20:38.738
you're the kind of person
who will break rules.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.607
What are you asking?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.842
Find a way to get those screws
rendered inadmissible.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.744
I don't care how you do it.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.913
Just get it done.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.916
MAN:
I need someone who's willing
to do whatever it takes.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.285
A real go-getter.
You know what I'm saying?

20:52.319 --> 20:55.422
Selling timeshares to
the elderly-- it's, uh...

20:55.455 --> 20:56.989
It's not as easy
as you might think.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.758
You got to work the
funeral circuit.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.794
You got to schmooze it up
at the early bird buffet.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.796
These people don't know
what to do with their money.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.365
But I do.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.899
I thought you focused on...

21:06.933 --> 21:08.801
commercial real estate.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.770
Oh, sure, my-my partners do.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.772
But this is way more lucrative.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.541
More turnover, you know?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.644
Hey, handsome fella
like yourself--

21:17.677 --> 21:19.546
:
you could make a real killing

21:19.579 --> 21:21.581
with the mah-jongg
ladies, huh?

21:25.752 --> 21:28.321
Oh.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.857
Someone's in a good mood.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.392
I am.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.926
And I hope your leg
is feeling better,

21:33.960 --> 21:35.695
'cause I'd love to
get working...

21:35.728 --> 21:36.929
on those drawers again.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.401
Hmm.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.736
Wait. Does that mean
you got the job?

21:43.770 --> 21:45.738
They made me an offer.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.975
Amazing!
But I turned it down.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.444
Wait. Why?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.012
'Cause of this.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.348
It's an amazing
property, undeveloped,

21:55.382 --> 21:58.451
no tourists yet, but
it is going to explode.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.453
My buddy Chase can
put together a group

22:00.487 --> 22:01.888
to invest and
build a hotel.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.491
And you'd...?
Manage it.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.526
What?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.874
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To reframe this....

22:54.907 --> 22:57.410
Okay, maybe not exactly
a reframe.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.878
Just emphasizing that...

22:58.911 --> 23:01.981
well, it's getting creepy.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.451
Mm. Whoa.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.185
What's that smell?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.922
That is the glorious scent
of Eva

23:09.956 --> 23:12.058
by Eva Longoria.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.626
I might have oversprayed.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.562
I'm just trying
to get inside her head

23:15.595 --> 23:17.129
to find a connection,
any connection.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.599
Well, good luck.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.934
Oh, did you ask
about sitting in on a class?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.103
Yup, and they said yes.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.139
Mm.
So I decided on

23:27.173 --> 23:28.541
art history and...

23:28.575 --> 23:31.578
Did Eva just say
what I think Eva said?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.547
Are you kidding me?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.583
I'm descended
from Benito Juárez?

23:36.616 --> 23:38.551
President Benito Juárez?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.887
Xo, she is descended

23:40.920 --> 23:43.623
from 19th-century
Mexican president

23:43.656 --> 23:44.991
Benito Juárez!

23:45.024 --> 23:46.693
Yeah

23:46.726 --> 23:50.730
My mother was always
very proud to be descended

23:50.763 --> 23:53.666
from 19th-century
Mexican president

23:53.700 --> 23:55.502
Benito Juárez!

23:55.535 --> 23:57.837
Which means...

24:00.773 --> 24:04.010
Eva and I... are related.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.713
We are... family!

24:06.746 --> 24:08.848
Rogelio!

24:08.881 --> 24:11.718
Inhala, exhala.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.065
:
Oh.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.862
RAFAEL: Thank you. You really
didn't have to do that.

25:29.896 --> 25:34.667
Yeah, I did.
You were right-- I was a jerk.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.036
It's hard for me
to not automatically flip

25:37.069 --> 25:38.971
to the practical,
and that's so wrong.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.307
Well, your apology present is
already being put to good use.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.242
I'm glad. I wanted

25:43.275 --> 25:45.712
to get you a gag gift that
wouldn't be a waste of money.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.113
Yeah, of course you did.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.881
I just want you to know,

25:48.915 --> 25:50.282
I do believe in you.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.118
Thank you.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.821
So, how's the grown-up
building project going?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.923
Well, uh,
Chase lined up a meeting

25:56.956 --> 25:58.691
for me to pitch some VCs.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.627
Ooh.
You know what VCs are?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.295
No.
Venture capitalists, money guys.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.998
I'm pitching that they give me
a finders fee which I'd apply

26:06.032 --> 26:08.134
to services that I would render
as a project manager.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.603
Which really just means
I don't put any money in,

26:10.637 --> 26:13.105
but I still get a small
percentage if it pans out.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.974
Well, that sounds
downright practical.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.242
I mean, not that it matters.

26:16.275 --> 26:19.345
O-Okay, uh,
you drop off your paperwork.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.714
Our general contractor
is having a setback

26:21.748 --> 26:23.115
at the construction site.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.652
See you guys later.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.189
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, let's reframe this.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.762
XIOMARA:
Wow.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.263
So, another grad student?

26:37.296 --> 26:38.898
Yeah.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.900
And I don't know why,
but knowing that--

26:40.933 --> 26:42.635
it just makes
our whole thing feel...

26:42.669 --> 26:43.903
Skeevy?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.772
Different.

26:45.805 --> 26:49.175
I-I mean, in my head,
I was this... transgression.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.144
We knew it was wrong, but we had
this undeniable chemistry.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.981
But if there's someone else,
if I'm one of many...

26:55.014 --> 26:57.016
It's skeevy.
Not yet.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.919
I mean, maybe they have the
same kind of crazy connection.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.188
Or maybe it's his M.O.,
which would be...

27:02.221 --> 27:03.890
Really skeevy.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.792
Where are you going?
To Internet stalk him.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.359
Find out if it's a pattern.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.095
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now that's a pattern.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.665
Wow. That shirt is so loud,
I can't hear myself think.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.067
I know your favorite colors
are maroon and turquoise

27:15.101 --> 27:16.936
because I have been studying
everything about you.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.204
Sorry. I'm a
little nervous.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.940
Oh. Relax. We're family, right?

27:20.973 --> 27:24.143
Fifth cousins once removed.
I don't care how removed.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.245
Ever since I've become pregnant,
I'm all about family.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.014
So...

27:28.047 --> 27:30.382
I'm so sorry I was so hard
to get ahold of. Water.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.121
Amazing.
Should we get down
to business?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.690
I've had 38 meetings today.
Yes. Yes, of course.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.258
What do you think
about the project?

27:39.291 --> 27:41.828
Go.
We like the idea
of an Americanized version of

27:41.861 --> 27:43.763
The Passions of Santos, but the
script, in its current shape,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.698
needs work. We think...
That's enough.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.100
I'm training them.
You are incredible.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.970
I know. So, she's not wrong.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.371
Taking the most popular show

27:52.404 --> 27:54.373
from Latin America
and importing it here?

27:54.406 --> 27:56.108
I like the sound of that.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.710
We can lean into the twists
and the turns,

27:57.744 --> 28:00.747
call it an homage.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.314
Oh.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.283
Sorry. Something
is in my eye.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.052
Anyway, the, uh,
female character needs

28:06.085 --> 28:07.353
to be reconceived.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.722
Are you open
to my story ideas?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.423
Absolutely, of course, anything.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.992
Well, then, great. I'm in.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.361
Pending a screen test.
Screen test.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.964
What monsters would make someone

28:17.997 --> 28:20.733
of your stature
take a screen test?

28:23.435 --> 28:25.137
Should we laugh?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.873
No. No.

28:26.906 --> 28:30.142
Uh, the screen test
is for you, not me.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.813
Uh, uh, a-a scree...

28:33.846 --> 28:36.015
a screen test for my own show?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.818
Rogelio, I need to make sure
you can rise up to my level.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.353
I mean, let's face it.
I don't have much to go off of

28:41.387 --> 28:43.422
since you're a relative unknown.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.257
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Did she just call

28:45.291 --> 28:47.059
her unknown relative
a relative unknown?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.928
But don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.463
When this is all done,
you're gonna have your own show.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.365
Because, let's face it,
I could fart

28:53.399 --> 28:55.067
and they'll greenlight it.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.803
Oh. Did I fart today?

28:56.836 --> 28:58.170
Not yet.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.206
Okay, well, remind me
to do it in the car.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.507
I heard it's good
for the baby.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.175
JANE:
This is outrageous.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.510
What'd you find out?

29:04.543 --> 29:06.412
According to my
Facebook sources,

29:06.445 --> 29:09.048
Chavez hooked up with at least
four other former students.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.217
See? I told you
he was a creep.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.886
Go back to working
on your pitch.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.856
It's done. I'm ready.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.827
So, what are you thinking?

29:20.860 --> 29:23.229
It's just weird.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.232
I didn't feel like he took
advantage of me at the time.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.468
I had a huge crush on him,
and I went after him.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.170
But knowing that he slept

29:31.203 --> 29:33.172
with all these other grad
students-- it just...

29:33.205 --> 29:34.807
reframes everything.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.075
You should report him.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.476
For what?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.478
He's not Marissa's
advisor. I checked.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.513
And there's no clear
university policy.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.249
Well, there should be.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.484
I mean, those are some
intense power dynamics.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.955
We dated, and I
was your employee.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.490
You were accidentally
inseminated with my child.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.526
So was I the only
employee you ever dated?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.830
No.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.966
Not in my life.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.934
When I worked for my dad,

30:01.968 --> 30:04.003
I mean,
I-I took advantage of that.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.838
But I'm a different person now.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.841
I know.

30:08.875 --> 30:12.011
So... what are you gonna do?

30:12.044 --> 30:13.412
I'm not sure.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.481
XIOMARA:
What do you think?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.283
The backpack's overkill, right?

30:17.316 --> 30:19.085
Ma, no, you look great.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.552
Don't be nervous.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.122
I just don't want the other
students to make fun of me.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.390
Oh, these are
college kids.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.958
They're not eighth
grade bullies.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.526
They'll be busy texting
and watching TV.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.128
Ow!

30:29.161 --> 30:31.163
That weird drawer injury
still bothering you?

30:31.197 --> 30:33.532
Yup.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.503
XIOMARA:
Is that Marissa?

30:37.536 --> 30:39.038
Yeah.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.173
What did you decide?

30:41.207 --> 30:43.009
Are you gonna
say anything to her?

30:43.042 --> 30:45.411
I don't know. Maybe
it's not my place.

30:45.444 --> 30:49.281
Or it's...
uniquely my place.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.917
I guess the question is,

30:50.950 --> 30:53.152
would you have wanted to know
when it was you?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.296
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, what a moment.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.432
Our Jane, once a student
of creative writing,

31:06.465 --> 31:08.000
now teaching it.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.435
Makes you think.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.603
Ooh, let's drop in
on this bit!

31:11.637 --> 31:13.539
Notice how the narrator
functions here.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.441
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Riveting, Professor Jane!

31:15.474 --> 31:18.377
And it's precisely because
the narrator doesn't comment

31:18.410 --> 31:20.947
on every moment that the
storytelling is so effective.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.915
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Fine. I can take a hint.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.283
The narrative distance

31:24.316 --> 31:26.986
allows for the story
to unfold naturally,

31:27.019 --> 31:28.921
making the
reader accept

31:28.955 --> 31:31.490
these magical realism elements
without question.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.430
Take, for example,
the man's wings.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.599
Márquez describes
the man

31:40.632 --> 31:43.069
as very old and...

31:43.102 --> 31:46.005
in the mud before
casually telling us

31:46.038 --> 31:48.274
that he couldn't
get up, uh,

31:48.307 --> 31:50.909
"impeded by his
enormous wings."

31:52.244 --> 31:53.712
Let's discuss

31:53.745 --> 31:56.548
this introduction
to magical realism.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.085
Yeah.
Honestly, I think that line
sets the tone

31:59.118 --> 32:01.053
for the whole story.
YOUNGER JANE:
Of course I'd want to know

32:01.087 --> 32:03.122
if Chavez slept
with students before me.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.656
I thought
I was special.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.327
He was gonna be my first.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.233
So, yes,

32:14.266 --> 32:16.102
this moment changes
our perception.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.704
MAN:
And perception,
of course, is crucial

32:18.737 --> 32:21.040
to pointillism.
And, interestingly,

32:21.073 --> 32:24.343
there is a scientific
tie-in here, uh, an antagonism

32:24.376 --> 32:26.712
that occurs in the brain,
used to detect color.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.715
To that I say,
que Seurat, Seurat.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.318
So, chromoluminarism

32:32.351 --> 32:34.520
evolved into pointillism.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.556
And what would you say
evolved from there?

32:39.425 --> 32:40.426
You.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.329
You've been quiet.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.664
Any ideas?
XIOMARA:
Uh...

32:45.697 --> 32:46.765
no.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.500
I'm-I'm just auditing.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.668
:
That's okay.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.538
You are still encouraged
to participate.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.607
Any contemporary styles
spring to mind?

32:55.641 --> 32:59.011
EVA:
I know this isn't
your idea of fun,

32:59.045 --> 33:01.280
but lack of chemistry
with a costar

33:01.313 --> 33:03.515
can sink a project, so...

33:03.549 --> 33:05.684
just want to make sure we
make sense together on screen.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.453
I have no doubt we ill,
sweet Eva.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.021
After all,
it runs in the family,

33:09.055 --> 33:10.556
since my cousin
thrice removed

33:10.589 --> 33:12.358
courted your fourth
cousin, Griselda.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.360
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Boy, that is distant.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.328
Wh... Did you
just say Criselda?

33:16.362 --> 33:19.031
Yes.
Or Griselda?

33:19.065 --> 33:22.034
What?
Did you say Criselda
or Griselda?

33:22.068 --> 33:23.569
Cruh or Gruh?

33:23.602 --> 33:25.104
Gruh. Griselda.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.574
'Cause... my fourth cousin
is a cruh, not a gruh.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.709
Griselda's my great aunt.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.711
Wait, I have a great aunt
named Griselda.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.313
Oh. No.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.315
BOTH:
She's my grandmother's sister.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.051
Wait, that doesn't... that
doesn't make us fifth cousins.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.353
That makes us
cousin cousins.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.256
Well, it's fine.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.725
Now that I think about it,
you do look like my Uncle Beto.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.360
WOMAN:
Okay. Let's test

33:48.394 --> 33:50.462
this chemistry.
Um...

33:50.496 --> 33:51.730
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Let's see those
kissing cousins.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.465
Whenever you're ready.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.234
:
Yup.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.669
*

33:57.703 --> 33:59.805
Of course you look like
my husband the president,

33:59.838 --> 34:02.474
but how can you be if you
don't have any of his memories?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.476
I don't know.
All I know

34:04.510 --> 34:06.178
is that I want to devour you.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.713
I suppose there is one way

34:07.746 --> 34:10.349
we can find out
if you're really him.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.286
K-Kiss me.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.591
Mm. Okay.
Come on.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.260
We need to show them
our unmistakable

34:21.293 --> 34:22.261
and searing chemistry.

34:22.294 --> 34:23.562
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.335
No! Oh. No.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.670
Honestly, I'd rather

34:31.703 --> 34:33.505
watch my parents screw.

34:33.539 --> 34:36.342
The screws are out.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.744
I got the judge to rule
them inadmissible.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.778
Wh... How?

34:39.811 --> 34:41.413
Chain of custody
issue.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.514
The cop left them in
his cruiser overnight,

34:42.548 --> 34:44.483
instead of logging them
into evidence right away,

34:44.516 --> 34:45.651
which means it's
compromised.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.453
Did that happen?
Is that true?

34:47.486 --> 34:49.555
It appears that it is.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.890
I told you,

34:51.923 --> 34:54.293
I'm going to get
you out of this.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.629
Good.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.666
'Cause if you don't,
your career is over.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.401
JANE:
So, that's it for me.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.336
Uh, thank you so much for
listening and participating.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.507
Thank you.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.545
Hey, Marissa, do
you have a minute?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.385
Ooh.

35:19.418 --> 35:22.754
Uh, I just wondered
if we could...

35:22.788 --> 35:24.790
talk sometime, one on one.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.158
About what?

35:28.694 --> 35:31.697
Look, the sexual dynamic

35:31.730 --> 35:33.565
between a student
and a professor

35:33.599 --> 35:35.767
is a complicated thing.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.937
It can be really thrilling,
uh, in my experience...

35:38.970 --> 35:40.672
Look,
all I said was

35:40.706 --> 35:42.708
that it was cool
that you published a book.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.576
It didn't mean
that I'm, like, into you.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.278
What?
First,

35:46.312 --> 35:47.946
you stared at me
through the entire lecture,

35:47.979 --> 35:49.948
and now you're straight-up
hitting on me.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.817
Oh, no. Marissa,
that was... Aah!

35:59.691 --> 36:01.227
What Marissa said
is technically true,

36:01.260 --> 36:04.830
but there is
very important context missing.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.932
My leg cramped,
and I accidentally

36:06.965 --> 36:09.868
grabbed her... breasts.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.737
While talking about
sexual dynamics

36:11.770 --> 36:14.406
between professors
and students?

36:15.941 --> 36:18.777
I agree. That discussion
was inappropriate.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.280
In fact...

36:22.481 --> 36:23.749
...that sort
of relationship

36:23.782 --> 36:25.384
is inappropriate--
even though it

36:25.417 --> 36:27.286
is not technically
off-limits here.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.388
Though, for the record,
I think it should be.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.458
Because it involves
very tricky power dynamics.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.327
And even if a student
thinks she wants something,

36:35.361 --> 36:37.263
she might really
regret it later

36:37.296 --> 36:39.331
when she's older
and smarter

36:39.365 --> 36:42.501
and has more information about
how that's a pretty gross abuse

36:42.534 --> 36:46.305
of power, especially
if it's a pattern.

36:48.674 --> 36:51.009
JANE:
So, no, I didn't get

36:51.042 --> 36:52.478
the teaching job.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.513
But at least I got
to say my piece.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.382
How was your class?

36:56.415 --> 36:57.883
You know, fine.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.651
:
Intense.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.720
I'll be right back.
Marissa.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.859
First, let me say again
how sorry I am.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.462
I definitely
didn't mean to do...

37:10.496 --> 37:11.997
what I did.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.933
I was just trying
to warn you about Chavez.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.803
I saw you kissing him
the other day, and...

37:17.836 --> 37:19.605
and I don't know,
the same thing happened to me

37:19.638 --> 37:22.474
when I was his student.
And I've since learned

37:22.508 --> 37:24.009
that this is
a pattern of his.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.412
And I wish I had known

37:26.445 --> 37:27.813
back when I was
involved with him,

37:27.846 --> 37:31.350
so I just wanted to pass
that information on to you.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.984
Just so you have it.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.687
Sisterhood and all.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.757
ROGELIO:
It's not like she's my sister.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.759
Cousins are sexy in Florida,

37:40.792 --> 37:42.761
but Eva made such a stink.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.631
I'm sorry, Rogelio.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.466
Are you okay?

37:47.499 --> 37:49.368
No.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.737
School sucked.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.705
I-I just didn't fit in.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.907
I felt like an old lady.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.776
A dumb old lady.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.778
What's with the suitcase?

37:59.811 --> 38:02.881
I have to fly to
New York tomorrow

38:02.914 --> 38:06.585
and beg River Fields
to meet with me.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.521
Oh.
And...

38:09.555 --> 38:12.791
I wanted to ask you
if-if you could

38:12.824 --> 38:15.694
watch Baby for me
while I'm gone.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.996
Why can't Darci do it?
She's going away.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.798
And if I ask her to reschedule,

38:19.831 --> 38:21.800
she'll make
an Eva Longoria-style stink

38:21.833 --> 38:24.803
on how I'm going back on
my promise to be Baby's danny.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.472
Which I'm not.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.407
Yet.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.975
Okay, forget it.
I just thought,

38:30.008 --> 38:32.578
since you're not
doing anything...
That's right.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.112
I'm not.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.114
I'm just trying
to figure out my life,

38:36.147 --> 38:38.950
which you would have noticed
if you paid attention,

38:38.984 --> 38:41.853
instead of just thinking
about yourself!

38:43.154 --> 38:45.457
I have a dance class to teach.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.094
JANE:
What's wrong?

38:49.127 --> 38:51.096
Chase cut me out
of the deal.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.631
What?

38:52.664 --> 38:53.999
I thought he
was your friend.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.834
Yeah, well, I guess not.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.836
And I didn't
protect myself legally,

38:57.869 --> 38:59.971
so, the VCs took advantage.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.840
I am so sorry.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.975
Yeah.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.845
But you know what?
I'm actually okay.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.047
It's funny.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.050
I'm even still
a little... excited.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.952
So, I put together
a deal, right?

39:13.985 --> 39:15.987
Which I haven't done
since I found the Marbella.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.789
And I remembered
I'm actually good

39:17.823 --> 39:21.059
at spotting properties
and seeing potential.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.429
So this one didn't work out,

39:23.462 --> 39:25.631
but maybe the next one will.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.133
Wow. Yes, exactly.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.536
I know, right?
Yeah.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.038
I don't know. For the first time
in a long time,

39:33.071 --> 39:36.141
I actually feel like
I have a plan.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.844
I'm really happy
for you, Raf.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.147
Hey.
Hmm.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.750
What's going on?

39:44.783 --> 39:46.452
It's nothing.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.886
You're inspired.
That's so great.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.755
And everything's
not about me.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.557
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Come on, Jane.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.593
Like I said earlier,
we know whose story this is.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.962
Are you upset 'cause
you didn't get the teaching job?

39:56.995 --> 39:58.930
No.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.733
I'm upset because I'm
relieved I didn't get it,

40:01.767 --> 40:03.935
because I don't want
to be a teacher.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.538
Or a lounge manager.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.874
You're a writer.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.443
You published a book.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.780
I know.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.215
And that was a goal
of mine for so long,

40:17.248 --> 40:21.019
you know, this-this
thing I can work towards.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.154
And after I got there,

40:23.188 --> 40:25.156
I imagined that my
life would change

40:25.190 --> 40:28.894
because I would be
this... big success.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.829
But it didn't.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.698
Hey.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.666
Oh.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.603
So, first, I've been lost
most of the time I've known you.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.240
So... you are allowed
to take a minute.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.909
Thank you.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.078
And you will find a path.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.115
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends, at that moment,

40:50.148 --> 40:52.083
she did.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.085
You're the only thing
I'm really sure about.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.921
Yeah?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.923
Yeah.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.992
And I... I think it's real,

41:01.026 --> 41:03.862
and it's right, and we
should tell our family

41:03.895 --> 41:06.197
that we're together.

41:07.999 --> 41:11.803
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right. No more secrets.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.172
At least not for that Jane.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.718
Actually,
let me reframe this for you.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.755
Good. Now tell them you
want to meet in person.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.902
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That definitely
ain't her dance class.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.773
And to reframe
this moment, friends:

41:47.806 --> 41:50.108
Xo's decision
to walk through that door

41:50.141 --> 41:52.578
would change her life forever.
