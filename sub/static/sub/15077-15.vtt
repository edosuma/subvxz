SO, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING

40:55.689 --> 40:57.557
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

40:57.590 --> 41:04.564
AND I REALIZED [SIGHS]
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE.

41:04.597 --> 41:08.268
ABOUT WHAT?

41:08.301 --> 41:12.105
I DON'T WANT TO
LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

41:12.138 --> 41:15.608
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY DAYS

41:15.642 --> 41:17.310
REGRETTING LOSING YOU.

41:17.344 --> 41:20.647
I WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY DAYS LOVING<i>YOU.</i>

41:20.680 --> 41:23.583
AND I'M READY TO JUST
THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND

41:23.616 --> 41:27.887
AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE KIDS --
HAVE YOUR KIDS.

41:27.921 --> 41:30.056
HEY, HEY, HEY, ENOUGH.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.661
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS NOW?

41:34.694 --> 41:36.629
WHERE WAS THIS
TWO MONTHS AGO?

41:36.663 --> 41:39.199
A MONTH AGO?
HELL, TWO WEEKS AGO?

41:39.232 --> 41:44.904
WELL, I...
I ONLY JUST REALIZED.

41:44.938 --> 41:47.173
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS HUGE REGRET

41:47.207 --> 41:48.575
AND NOT TELL YOU.

41:48.608 --> 41:54.280
WELL, THANK YOU, THEN,
FOR TELLING ME.

41:54.314 --> 41:56.583
AND BRAVO
FOR YOUR EPIPHANY.

41:56.616 --> 41:59.686
I'M SURE THAT --
THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD

41:59.719 --> 42:01.688
TO GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

42:03.390 --> 42:06.726
BUT I AM NOT SOME GODDAMN YO-YO
THAT YOU CAN JUST TOY WITH.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.195
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

42:11.197 --> 42:14.601
YOU KNOW, JUST WHEN I START
TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE!

42:17.370 --> 42:21.374
I CAN'T GO THROUGH IT
AGAIN.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.309
I'M DONE.
