WEBVTT

00:00.101 --> 00:01.600
Previously on Greek...

00:01.702 --> 00:03.870
Can't we just admit
we both made some mistakes,

00:03.904 --> 00:05.938
- and move on?
- I deserve better.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.007
- Even Casey thinks so.
- Chambers.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.410
It's no free pass,
being the progeny of the elite.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.513
I believe it took JFK Jr.
Three tries to pass the bar.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.315
- Dale's pledging Omega Chi.
- Maybe they were the ones who called the cops

00:16.383 --> 00:18.551
on our rush party, to get
back at us for spring break.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.621
They're definitely messing with Dale.
His being a pledge, it's all a lie

00:21.655 --> 00:24.157
to get back at you for spring break.
Now, Dale's gonna embarrass himself

00:24.191 --> 00:27.560
- at the Pledge Talent Show.
- In the market for a marketing job?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.228
Actually, yeah.
Do you know anyone who's hiring?

00:29.263 --> 00:32.497
- Me! - If you're to proud to
accept help from time to time,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.068
- then you really are a terrible president.
- Tegan doesn't think

00:35.102 --> 00:37.270
that I can do this on my own.
I have to prove that I can.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.372
To Tegan or to you?

00:41.408 --> 00:44.811
The Stanford girls have a
three-eight cumulative GPA,

00:44.845 --> 00:48.081
and completed
a major beach clean-up.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.183
Well, according to
their Facebook photos,

00:50.217 --> 00:52.785
the only trash they picked up
were some local surfers.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.290
Sisters, give it a rest.
The votes are tallied.

00:57.324 --> 01:00.360
And the finalists are...

01:00.394 --> 01:03.162
ZBZ Boston University,
Epsilon Rho chapter,

01:03.197 --> 01:05.832
ZBZ San Diego State,
Gamma chapter.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.235
And the final chapter is...

01:10.537 --> 01:13.239
Where the hell is Cyprus-Rhodes?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.345
Send out the emails.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.154
Drop what you're chewing
and listen up!

01:28.188 --> 01:29.956
I just got an email
from Nationals.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.693
We are... finalists
for the Golden Lily!

01:37.164 --> 01:40.166
- This is awesome!
- So deserved!

01:40.200 --> 01:43.035
- What's a Golden Lily?
- The Golden Lily is like Nationals'

01:43.070 --> 01:46.239
Congressional Medal of Honor, given to
the best ZBZ chapter in the nation.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.709
- Including Puerto Rico and Guam.
- Wow, given our past,

01:49.743 --> 01:51.677
I guess everyone loves
a comeback story.

01:51.712 --> 01:55.081
The Grand Council is visiting each
finalist's house before voting,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.717
and we're up this weekend, which
means I'll need all hands on deck,

01:57.751 --> 02:00.386
- including house mother hands.
- Oh, absolutely.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.055
We could host a nice tea,
put out the china.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.091
Tea's not going to win us
the Golden Lily, Case.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.595
As you said, we're the underdogs
and I hate being the underdog.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.298
We need something big to show the
Grand Council what we can do

02:12.332 --> 02:14.534
- with just a few days notice.
- What are you thinking, Becks?

02:14.568 --> 02:17.904
Laura, I want a bouquet of lilies
waiting in the Council's hotel rooms

02:17.938 --> 02:21.240
the minute they arrive.
Borrow from the scholarship fund if you have to.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.709
- Can I finish eating first?
- No. Everyone else,

02:23.744 --> 02:25.545
start brainstorming ideas
for an event.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.013
We'll have a strategy
meeting tomorrow.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.714
I don't care if we
have to kidnap

02:28.749 --> 02:31.584
Mary Beth Gentrie-Manning's
granddaughters,

02:31.618 --> 02:33.719
let's make this happen, girls.

02:35.856 --> 02:40.693
Oh, um, you were joking about the
kidnapping her granddaughters thing, right?

02:40.727 --> 02:42.762
Duh! M.B.G.M.
Only has grandsons.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.897
But I need to win this, Case.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.767
This is my chance to prove to Tegan
and all my doubters at Nationals

02:47.801 --> 02:50.269
- that I am a good leader.
- I get it.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.638
Thanks. And you'll be
at that strategy meeting.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.374
- Well, I have class, but...
- That wasn't a question.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.243
Becks, how can the pledges help?

02:57.277 --> 03:00.246
Walk with me, poodle.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.952
"Poodle?"

03:10.257 --> 03:12.225
That's it!
Yeah! Keep going!

03:12.259 --> 03:14.961
Please don't be her.

03:14.995 --> 03:18.564
Higher! Higher!

03:18.599 --> 03:20.967
Whoo! Higher!

03:21.001 --> 03:22.935
Higher!

03:22.970 --> 03:26.439
- What's going on?
- We're seeing who can jump the longest!

03:26.473 --> 03:30.643
- How long have you been going for?
- Twenty-five...

03:30.677 --> 03:32.778
seconds.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.981
You wanna jump on?
Show us what you got?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.917
- Oh, I got a lot!
- Yeah!

03:37.951 --> 03:40.319
Whoa! Hey!

03:40.354 --> 03:46.058
<i>♪ I am an aeroplane ♪</i>

03:46.093 --> 03:48.661
<i>♪ Point me at the sky ♪</i>

03:48.695 --> 03:51.597
<i>♪ I am gazelle sprint ♪</i>

03:51.632 --> 03:54.834
<i>♪ Running away

03:54.868 --> 03:57.870
- Ah! Synchronize jumps!
- Copy that!

03:57.905 --> 04:00.973
- Synchronizing!
- And... go!

04:04.747 --> 04:08.490
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

04:12.749 --> 04:15.150
Anthony Hopkins,
they're all sitting up there.

04:15.185 --> 04:17.553
- We were just jumping on the bed.
- Yeah, like this.

04:17.587 --> 04:19.088
- It was like...
- Beav, maybe you shouldn't.

04:19.122 --> 04:20.389
- ...synchronizing...
- Holy crap, Beav!

04:20.423 --> 04:22.891
- Whoa!
- God!

04:22.926 --> 04:25.694
Oh, no, no! It's
holding my blood! Don't!

04:25.729 --> 04:27.496
I can't watch.

04:28.565 --> 04:30.266
It's fine.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.967
It just went through
your pants, man.

04:34.371 --> 04:36.705
<i>Well, while you guys were
playing True Blood,</i>

04:36.740 --> 04:40.976
I was on the phone with our national
rep trying to get money for repairs.

04:41.011 --> 04:44.813
- What'd he say? - After he reminded
me that we're already on thin ice

04:44.848 --> 04:48.951
for having one pledge
and being on academic probation,

04:48.985 --> 04:52.221
he said he was excited to see how
we're gonna handle this on our own.

04:52.255 --> 04:56.091
So we can thank our mysterious
saboteur, Villain X.

04:56.126 --> 04:58.927
Well, if Trip's telling the truth
and it wasn't the Omega Chis,

04:58.962 --> 05:01.830
then who the hell
is messing with us?

05:01.865 --> 05:05.200
Mr. Spitter, I got big news!
Maybe it can wait.

05:05.235 --> 05:09.672
- What's up? - I was in freshman physics
and I overheard Professor Hastings

05:09.706 --> 05:13.342
talking about how some company is interested
in buying your self-healing wire patent.

05:13.376 --> 05:15.778
Seriously? Did he say who?

05:15.812 --> 05:19.581
Yeah, uh, Chambers lnternational?
Ever heard of them?

05:19.616 --> 05:22.785
Chambers lnternational
creates evil things

05:22.819 --> 05:26.221
like vertically integrated
telecommunications monopolies,

05:26.256 --> 05:29.992
- and jerks named Evan. - What would the
Dark Lord's empire want with your wire?

05:30.026 --> 05:32.361
It's not my wire anymore.

05:32.395 --> 05:34.797
But I'd like to know what's happening with it.
I deserve to know.

05:34.831 --> 05:37.166
Ah, a boy and his wire.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.535
The unconventional
love story of the summer.

05:39.569 --> 05:43.472
You know what? I think I know someone
who can help us out with the house.

05:43.506 --> 05:46.775
Well, I'm gonna go do something
I really don't want to do:

05:46.810 --> 05:48.677
Talk to a Chambers.

05:51.848 --> 05:53.349
- Hey, Ash.
- Hi.

05:53.383 --> 05:56.385
- I have some big news.
- Me, too!

05:56.419 --> 05:58.887
Working for Clarissa's
marketing company isn't lame.

05:58.922 --> 06:02.424
I got her off that mobisode kick,
she totally loves all my ideas

06:02.459 --> 06:05.060
and I even brought
in my first client today.

06:05.095 --> 06:08.197
- Pouty Plump Lip Gloss.
OK, so your turn. Go. - Yay!

06:08.231 --> 06:10.733
OK. Did you hear
about the Golden Lily?

06:10.767 --> 06:14.002
Oh, are they delivering now?
'Cause I could really go for some moo shu.

06:15.572 --> 06:18.540
No, ZBZ is nominated
for the Golden Lily Award

06:18.575 --> 06:21.377
- for the best chapter in the nation!
- Oh, right. Yes.

06:21.411 --> 06:23.979
- Including Puerto Rico and Guam.
That's great. - Mm-hm.

06:24.013 --> 06:28.350
- So great. It's just, um...
- Guam has a kick-ass house?

06:28.385 --> 06:30.619
No. It's Rebecca.

06:30.653 --> 06:32.688
She's super determined to win.

06:32.722 --> 06:34.456
She's dipping into
the scholarship fund,

06:34.491 --> 06:36.358
ordering around sisters
like they're lackeys.

06:36.393 --> 06:38.794
It kinda reminded me of...

06:38.828 --> 06:42.064
- ...Frannie. - OK. I know it's
your job to look out for the house,

06:42.098 --> 06:44.500
but don't you think you're
overreacting, like, a little?

06:44.534 --> 06:47.336
It's a really big awar Of
course she's gung ho on winning.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.605
OK, maybe you're right,
but it's weird.

06:49.639 --> 06:51.240
Would you just come
with me to the meeting?

06:51.274 --> 06:53.642
If for nothing more then to
lend the house your expertise.

06:53.676 --> 06:57.279
Well, I am pretty expertise-y
now that I'm dominating

06:57.313 --> 07:00.149
the marketing world of the
lower central Rust Belt, so...

07:00.183 --> 07:02.351
Exactly.

07:02.385 --> 07:05.854
OK, do you still want to order
Chinese? 'Cause I could eat.

07:10.193 --> 07:14.496
Trip, if I didn't know any better, I
would say you've been avoiding me.

07:14.531 --> 07:18.100
Yeah, because I don't need to
hear your whole Team Dale rant.

07:18.134 --> 07:20.602
You've made your feelings perfectly
clear about the Pledge Talent Show.

07:20.637 --> 07:23.672
Did you really think I was just
gonna let you humiliate my friend

07:23.706 --> 07:25.707
in front of the
entire Greek system?

07:25.742 --> 07:31.146
You don't let me do anything.
I'm president now, not you.

07:32.348 --> 07:35.284
Back off, Owens!

07:35.318 --> 07:38.020
No. You started all this when
you gave Dale a fake bid!

07:38.054 --> 07:41.690
We only messed with him to get revenge for
spring break, which you were a part of!

07:41.724 --> 07:43.559
Are you saying
this is all my fault?

07:43.593 --> 07:46.895
I'm saying we're even with Rusty
and the KTs, so let it go.

07:46.930 --> 07:50.566
Look, Dale is gone,
but you're not.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.335
Yeah? Not yet.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:03.580 --> 08:06.315
- What do you want?
- I came to talk.

08:06.349 --> 08:08.817
It's not about my sister
or the fraternities.

08:08.852 --> 08:11.887
It's actually
about your family.

08:11.921 --> 08:13.755
Make it quick.

08:17.961 --> 08:22.030
It's about my self-healing wire,
which I'm sure you've heard of.

08:22.065 --> 08:26.535
- It was a pretty big breakthrough.
- I'll take your word for it.

08:26.569 --> 08:30.472
Well, the university thought enough of it to
take it from me and give it to a research team,

08:30.507 --> 08:33.075
but now your dad's company
is buying the patent.

08:33.109 --> 08:37.011
- What do you want from me? - I just want you
to find out what they plan to do with it.

08:37.046 --> 08:40.082
I don't know, Rusty. I haven't spoken
to my parents in almost a year,

08:40.116 --> 08:41.850
and I'm not
gonna start for you.

08:45.388 --> 08:47.256
I'm not asking you
to make up with them.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.691
I was just hoping you could tell
me what they're doing with it.

08:49.726 --> 08:52.194
No. Now, get out.

08:55.164 --> 08:58.667
I can't imagine why your parents wouldn't want
to talk to a kind, selfless son like you.

08:58.701 --> 09:02.070
Rusty, I'd go now, before paddles
start coming off the wall.

09:12.048 --> 09:16.218
OK, we need to show Nationals
just what CRU ZBZ can accomplish.

09:16.252 --> 09:18.620
Charity fundraiser.

09:18.655 --> 09:20.889
My father always used to say,
what good is altruism

09:20.924 --> 09:22.758
if you can't benefit from it?

09:22.792 --> 09:25.127
Thoughts?

09:25.161 --> 09:27.162
- Laura.
- I was thinking...

09:27.196 --> 09:29.631
Can you lean back
so I can see Casey?

09:31.167 --> 09:34.169
Oh, yeah, I think
that sounds like a great idea.

09:34.203 --> 09:37.773
Our chapter has had a history
of successful philanthropy.

09:37.807 --> 09:40.709
And there are so many great
causes. Literacy,

09:40.743 --> 09:42.644
- women's rights...
- Tree frogs.

09:42.679 --> 09:45.280
- Huh? - Mary Beth
Gentrie-Manning's favorite charity

09:45.315 --> 09:48.984
- is the Foundation for the Amazon Red-Eyed Tree Frog.
- Pandering through charity.

09:49.018 --> 09:50.519
I like it. Good job, Heather.

09:51.888 --> 09:54.423
You pledges could
learn from her.

09:54.457 --> 09:58.627
But we can't just do our usual lame
theme party, carnival, dance, whatever.

09:58.661 --> 10:01.196
I think we should do
a big benefit concert.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.365
Anybody know if the
stadium's available?

10:03.399 --> 10:05.500
That's pretty ambitious.

10:05.535 --> 10:08.637
- Don't you think, Ash?
- That is a lot of people.

10:08.671 --> 10:11.607
A lot of people who might
want to try Pouty Plump,

10:11.641 --> 10:15.010
the new up-and-coming
lip gloss line I'm working with.

10:15.044 --> 10:17.179
It makes your lips bigger,
it only burns a little.

10:17.213 --> 10:19.715
I'm sure once they hear
"sorority," they'll totally want

10:19.749 --> 10:23.151
to donate free product
and sponsor us.

10:23.186 --> 10:25.320
Totally. What?

10:25.355 --> 10:31.059
I think realistically we're not going
to get the stadium in a day's notice.

10:32.128 --> 10:33.795
How about the backyard?

10:33.830 --> 10:35.464
We can hardly fit
a hundred people there.

10:35.498 --> 10:40.569
But if we charge
$500 a person...

10:40.603 --> 10:43.038
We'll need a great performer.

10:43.072 --> 10:45.340
Well, this guy in my
English class has a friend

10:45.375 --> 10:48.710
who has a workout partner who is
good friends with Drew Lachey.

10:50.713 --> 10:53.882
Fortunately, I've contacted one of
our alums who I'm hoping can help.

10:53.916 --> 10:58.420
She lives in Los Angeles and works
in the entertainment industry.

10:58.454 --> 11:02.024
Oh, here she is now!

11:02.058 --> 11:05.127
Everyone, I'd like you
to please welcome back...

11:06.462 --> 11:08.530
Oh, my God.

11:08.564 --> 11:12.034
- Frannie!?
- Hi, girls. Miss me?

11:22.106 --> 11:25.341
Oh, my God, look at this place.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.009
Look at you guys.

11:27.044 --> 11:29.412
Laura! Hi.

11:29.446 --> 11:32.515
Well, Frannie,
I haven't seen you since...

11:32.549 --> 11:34.617
you tried to have me expelled.

11:34.651 --> 11:37.753
But it didn't work,
'cause I graduated, so... yay.

11:37.788 --> 11:40.189
I'm sorry about that, Ash.

11:40.224 --> 11:42.158
But congratulations, though!

11:42.192 --> 11:45.728
So, yeah, it's been a while.

11:45.762 --> 11:47.196
Yes, it has.

11:47.231 --> 11:50.533
So, um, what exactly
are you up to now?

11:50.567 --> 11:52.235
Oh, I actually work at CAA.

11:52.269 --> 11:54.403
Chi Alpha Alpha?

11:54.438 --> 11:56.906
Creative Artists Agency.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.675
One of the world's
largest talent agencies.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.744
You thought this
organization had secrets?

12:01.778 --> 12:03.679
Oh, wow.
They rep all the big names.

12:03.714 --> 12:07.283
Reese, Alyssa, Hillary.

12:07.317 --> 12:10.186
<i>- They're all over US Weekly.
- Frannie came here to help out.</i>

12:10.220 --> 12:13.356
- It's what I do. I represent.
- For which sorority?

12:13.390 --> 12:19.028
We all know I wasn't
a model ZBZ my last two years.

12:19.062 --> 12:23.466
My leaving and starting
the I-Kaps was bad, I know.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.736
So when Rebecca called and said you guys
were nominated for the Golden Lily,

12:26.770 --> 12:29.272
- I pulled a weekend vacay.
- We're throwing a benefit concert

12:29.306 --> 12:32.208
- for the Amazon red-eyed tree frogs.
- Oh, Mary Beth's fave.

12:32.242 --> 12:35.645
Wow, I can't believe
I actually still remember that.

12:35.679 --> 12:40.316
Well, we're pretty much all set,
except for booking a performer,

12:40.350 --> 12:43.920
but Laura is close, personal
friends with Drew Lachey...

12:43.954 --> 12:47.356
Not gonna happen. He's doing a reality
bass fishing show in Wyoming.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.893
I helped package it. I don't
want to step on any toes,

12:50.928 --> 12:52.795
but I could get
a guest performer.

12:52.829 --> 12:55.598
Maybe... Justin Bieber?

12:55.632 --> 12:57.934
- Seriously?
- Seriously?! I love him!

12:57.968 --> 13:00.636
The kid owes me for a booking I did.
It's just a matter of making a call.

13:00.671 --> 13:02.004
- Well, we might...
- Bieber me.

13:05.509 --> 13:10.146
So you know that dream where you're naked
and the whole school is laughing at you?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.782
They're applauding, but go on.

13:12.816 --> 13:16.852
Well, Trip and some of his crew,
they made that come true for Dale.

13:16.887 --> 13:19.589
- And then they kicked him out.
- They dung him out?

13:19.623 --> 13:24.260
Yeah. I'm so tired of their crap.
I'm gonna quit, too.

13:24.294 --> 13:28.197
Wait, so you're caving to
those losers propping up Trip?

13:28.232 --> 13:31.767
For a guy who talks about wanting to
make a difference and change the world,

13:31.802 --> 13:33.970
Cal, you're just
not showing me that much.

13:34.004 --> 13:36.339
It's not the world.
It's a fraternity.

13:36.373 --> 13:38.874
Of which you've been a member
for over two years.

13:38.909 --> 13:42.745
The purpose of the house is to
build guys up, not tear them down.

13:42.779 --> 13:47.016
Oh, not anymore. We've become that cliché,
jerk fraternity that everybody hates.

13:47.050 --> 13:50.586
Well, then do something about it.
For the house and for Dale.

13:50.621 --> 13:54.090
Tackle Trip and those guys head on and be a leader.
Trust me, you're doing them a favor.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.559
Like you helping Rusty?

13:56.593 --> 13:58.995
Can't you just find out what your
dad's company is gonna do with it?

13:59.029 --> 14:01.097
It would mean
talking to my parents.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.233
You mean, "tackling
the problem head on"?

14:07.404 --> 14:13.109
As you can see, the Kappa Tau house
truly is a historical landmark.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.777
That's what
I'm here to find out.

14:14.811 --> 14:17.446
An historical grant would
definitely help repair

14:17.481 --> 14:20.316
and preserve
this natural wonder.

14:20.350 --> 14:23.819
Not that these
gentlemen are desperate.

14:23.854 --> 14:28.090
Thank God you're here.
This is the Lasker Parkes,

14:28.125 --> 14:32.194
world-renowned software mogul,
and this is his birthplace.

14:32.229 --> 14:35.197
Well, no, actually, that would
be Punta Gorda, Florida.

14:35.232 --> 14:40.002
But this room is where I got the idea for my
first educational application, "Piece of Math."

14:40.037 --> 14:42.772
You see, I was tutoring
some sorority girls.

14:47.110 --> 14:50.046
- You called my dad? - Yeah.
And he came right away. Is he great or what?

14:55.218 --> 14:57.887
- "Let's talk. Evan."
- Let's not talk Evan.

14:57.921 --> 15:01.157
Have I showed you
our historical asbestos?

15:01.191 --> 15:03.192
- Come this way.
- Right this way.

15:04.861 --> 15:08.397
Rebecca! I can't believe
you invited Frannie.

15:08.432 --> 15:12.034
- You hated her! - A necessary evil.
I want that Golden Lily.

15:12.069 --> 15:14.203
You used Frannie's playbook
with Tegan and it worked.

15:14.237 --> 15:16.739
I skipped the playbook and called the coach.
And she delivered.

15:16.773 --> 15:20.276
What makes you think we can trust her?
I mean, Justin Bieber?

15:20.310 --> 15:23.145
A Bieber in the hand is worth
two Lacheys in the bush.

15:23.180 --> 15:26.148
- I don't know what that means.
- Look, if she double-crosses us,

15:26.183 --> 15:28.651
we blame her publicly and
get Nationals' sympathy vote.

15:29.820 --> 15:32.188
Oh! Sorry.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.390
- Looks serious.
- Actually, it is.

15:34.424 --> 15:36.959
- Becks and I were just talking about...
- Bieber, Bieber!

15:36.993 --> 15:40.563
Can't wait.
Thank you, Frannie!

15:44.368 --> 15:46.268
How crazy is this, huh?

15:46.303 --> 15:50.039
You, me, Ash, all back
here from the real world.

15:50.073 --> 15:53.242
- So where are you living now?
- Upstairs. I'm the house mom.

15:53.276 --> 15:55.277
Oh. Great. Anyway, um,

15:55.312 --> 15:58.314
Ashleigh and I are gonna
hit up Dobler's, catch up.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.751
- Why don't you come?
- Ashleigh, really?

16:01.785 --> 16:07.156
Yeah, I can't. There's still a
lot of Golden Lily stuff to do.

16:07.190 --> 16:10.826
We can do that, too. I need to get you up
to speed on the rider in Justin's contract.

16:10.861 --> 16:14.130
- A rider is... - I know what a
rider is, I am in law school.

16:14.164 --> 16:18.067
You're in law school? See, we have so
much to catch up on. And it'll be on CAA.

16:18.101 --> 16:21.570
I'll just say I'm doing research for a series
about the Greek system or some crap like that.

16:21.605 --> 16:25.374
Yeah. Look, Frannie, last week
Rebecca won the Pledge Talent Show

16:25.409 --> 16:28.377
by using the same slutty dance you
made her do when she was a pledge.

16:28.412 --> 16:30.946
And then I hear she threatened to
burn down the Gamma Psi house again.

16:30.981 --> 16:34.383
- What do you mean again?
- The point is, Rebecca is going a little...

16:35.719 --> 16:38.320
you, and it's starting
to affect the pledges.

16:38.355 --> 16:42.091
And I worry you being here, giving
her tips from your playbook,

16:42.125 --> 16:45.294
- it's just gonna make things worse.
- That was the old me.

16:45.328 --> 16:48.397
- I've changed.
- We'll see about that.

16:48.432 --> 16:53.502
- OK, who's ready for alumni lady drinks?
- I could use a drink.

17:07.083 --> 17:10.986
Whoa! This is where you grew up?

17:11.021 --> 17:14.290
- You are Lex Luthor.
- I heard that.

17:14.324 --> 17:18.394
<i>Just like I had to hear NPR's Science
Friday the whole drive down.</i>

17:19.529 --> 17:21.130
All right, so here's the deal.

17:21.164 --> 17:22.932
I'm letting my parents
think I'm here to make amends.

17:22.965 --> 17:24.300
So don't bring up
the wire right away.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.569
- So you're lying to them?
- Rusty,

17:27.604 --> 17:30.172
this is how you deal with them.
You don't tip your hand too soon.

17:30.207 --> 17:32.174
All right?
Just let me handle it.

17:32.209 --> 17:34.977
- Evan?
- Mom.

17:35.011 --> 17:37.379
- You look good.
- Thanks.

17:37.414 --> 17:40.583
- Your hair's shorter.
- It's been a year.

17:44.921 --> 17:48.724
- So who is this?
- Oh, this is my buddy, Rusty Cartwright.

17:48.758 --> 17:52.261
- Yeah, good buddies.
- Cartwright? Um...

17:52.295 --> 17:55.164
- Stacy's brother?
- Casey.

17:55.198 --> 17:56.699
- Casey.
- Right.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.767
- Is Dad home?
- Oh, he'll be around.

17:58.802 --> 18:01.570
Come on in.
We'll get reacquainted.

18:10.649 --> 18:12.249
Thank you.

18:12.284 --> 18:14.118
Rusty.

18:18.790 --> 18:23.094
- So, Evan, how's law school?
- It's good.

18:23.128 --> 18:25.663
You still thinking about
running for office one day?

18:25.697 --> 18:27.064
I have a friend
in our state senator's...

18:27.099 --> 18:30.501
Actually, I think I'm gonna
practice law instead.

18:32.304 --> 18:35.106
Mm. That's good water,
Mrs. Chambers.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.441
It's the best I've ever had.

18:40.512 --> 18:42.947
So, um, what are your
favorite classes?

18:42.981 --> 18:46.884
Uh, constitutional
law's interesting.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.653
Torts. Contract law.

18:49.688 --> 18:52.123
You know, one of the contracts
the company signed

18:52.157 --> 18:55.226
was for a self-healing wire
that Rusty here invented.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.297
Yeah. He was wondering what
you're gonna use it for.

19:00.332 --> 19:03.334
So this isn't
just a friendly visit?

19:05.437 --> 19:08.706
All right. You're up.

19:11.042 --> 19:15.212
Well, as the inventor,
I was hoping that you could...

19:15.247 --> 19:17.782
A year goes by,
we don't see you,

19:17.816 --> 19:20.751
and now you just show up
to talk about electronics?

19:20.786 --> 19:24.355
- It's not just electronics.
- If I'd known this was a business meal,

19:24.389 --> 19:26.757
- I would have come prepared.
- Jonathan...

19:26.792 --> 19:28.359
Excuse me.

19:34.199 --> 19:37.034
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you with your stupid wire.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.470
- What's it look like? - It looks like
you're trying to piss off your parents.

19:39.504 --> 19:41.405
Back off, Rusty.
I'm doing this for you, OK?

19:41.439 --> 19:43.374
So just shut up
and let me handle it.

19:48.246 --> 19:53.017
So, law school! That was always
the original plan, right?

19:53.051 --> 19:55.820
Are you back to the original
plan with Evan Chambers?

19:57.255 --> 19:59.490
Actually, I'm with Cappie.

19:59.524 --> 20:01.659
Oh. Great.

20:04.029 --> 20:07.531
And you,
you're already an agent.

20:07.566 --> 20:10.734
- Didn't you just graduate last year?
- I slept my way to the top.

20:13.205 --> 20:15.673
That was a joke.

20:17.242 --> 20:20.477
We need some drinks! What
is up with the service today?

20:20.512 --> 20:23.013
- It was never this bad when I worked here.
- You worked here?

20:23.048 --> 20:26.383
Yeah, for, like, a week or two.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.953
Then I got fired for breaking in.
But I think they're over it.

20:28.987 --> 20:31.956
So I'm gonna go grab us some drinks.
Maybe even on the house.

20:31.990 --> 20:35.226
Ash, I can do it.
I can really... I can... OK.

20:41.766 --> 20:46.337
I guess even after a year, things
are still awkward with us.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.172
- I'm really trying.
- Why?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.708
Because you're
the reason I'm here.

20:50.742 --> 20:54.845
- Me? - Don't look so surprised.
I sent you like a dozen emails

20:54.880 --> 20:56.680
after I graduated,
but you never responded.

20:56.715 --> 21:01.151
Rebecca told me she called you, I
didn't realize it was from downstairs.

21:01.186 --> 21:03.420
I thought coming here would
give us a chance to reconnect.

21:03.455 --> 21:07.258
You and I were friends once,
and so much has changed.

21:07.292 --> 21:11.262
- I'm a different person.
- Yeah, I'm different, too.

21:11.296 --> 21:13.764
I mean, I'm still here.
That's the same.

21:13.798 --> 21:16.367
And I'm still living in the
house. That's the same, too.

21:16.401 --> 21:21.038
- But I'm different in so many other ways.
- I'm sure you are.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.741
I just wanted you to know
that I've missed you.

21:24.809 --> 21:27.077
OK, so the girl at the bar

21:27.112 --> 21:28.979
still seemed really mad at me.

21:29.014 --> 21:30.681
So I guess they're not over it.

21:30.715 --> 21:34.618
Oh, God, you don't think
they spit in it, do you?

21:34.653 --> 21:37.588
How about a beer
in a bottle instead?

21:43.328 --> 21:48.465
<i>There is only true messiah,
and his name is Jesus.</i>

21:48.500 --> 21:50.367
<i>There is only one.</i>

21:50.402 --> 21:54.939
Hey, Dale. What are you doing?

21:54.973 --> 21:58.609
Reacquainting myself with the only
institution that ever accepted me.

22:00.478 --> 22:03.714
OK, look. Omega Chi
did not reject you.

22:03.748 --> 22:06.917
- A few bad apples did.
- Trip's more of an orange.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.386
Like a blood orange
I'd like to squeeze dry.

22:09.421 --> 22:11.822
OK. Well, yeah,
let's not take this lying down.

22:11.856 --> 22:13.157
The whole house humiliated me.

22:13.191 --> 22:15.259
Trip and his friends
are not the whole house.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.761
They took everything that was
good away from Omega Chi,

22:17.796 --> 22:20.597
and I want it back,
but I cannot do it alone.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.434
Do whatever you want, but
don't expect any help from me.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.703
I've turned down my collars,
I'm done.

22:25.737 --> 22:28.672
- What about the future Mrs.
Dale Kettlewell? - I've hung that up, too.

22:28.707 --> 22:31.575
I'm don't think Laura's an option
now that I'm not an Omega Chi.

22:31.609 --> 22:34.378
Uh, well, I don't know
about Laura, but what about

22:34.412 --> 22:36.847
all the things that you
learned at Omega Chi?

22:36.881 --> 22:38.615
Brotherhood? Honor? All that?

22:38.650 --> 22:40.718
Why should I believe it
if they don't?

22:40.752 --> 22:43.654
The only reason I rushed is 'cause
Evan said loyalty and camaraderie

22:43.688 --> 22:48.192
make fraternities more than just a
place to drink beer and chase girls.

22:48.226 --> 22:51.795
- I can't believe I ever bought any of that bunk.
- It's not bunk to me.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.265
At least it wasn't.
I don't think it has to be.

22:58.069 --> 23:02.106
<i>...Jesus Christ!</i>

23:02.140 --> 23:05.442
So your mother's very happy

23:05.477 --> 23:08.645
that you agreed
to spend the night.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.316
Well, you know,
she's hard to say no to.

23:14.886 --> 23:20.457
Well, you came all this way to talk
business, let's talk business.

23:22.427 --> 23:24.828
Before you get too excited,
we buy dozens of patents

23:24.863 --> 23:28.799
for healing cable insulation,
and the crap never pans out.

23:28.833 --> 23:33.137
- So we scrap it. - My wire doesn't just
heal its insulation, it keeps conducting.

23:33.171 --> 23:36.940
We're not looking for creative
control or net profit participation,

23:36.975 --> 23:40.310
but by involving the original creator,
you have access to the origins...

23:40.345 --> 23:43.881
No offense, but why do I need
access to the original origins?

23:43.915 --> 23:46.216
The past is irrelevant.
I own it.

23:46.251 --> 23:50.054
Evan, you're appealing
to me personally when...

23:50.088 --> 23:54.558
Personal relationships always take
a back seat to professional ones.

23:54.592 --> 23:59.363
I forgot that one, Dad.
That's the Chambers rule, isn't it?

24:03.701 --> 24:07.671
You couldn't have
called us once? In a year?

24:07.705 --> 24:09.973
We're your parents.

24:10.008 --> 24:12.910
Yeah, it's not exactly like my
phone was ringing off the hook.

24:12.944 --> 24:16.880
- No one's asked me how I've been doing on my own.
- I know how you're doing.

24:16.915 --> 24:21.151
You live in a five-by-nine dorm room,
$304 in your checking account,

24:21.186 --> 24:26.156
good grades, despite getting your butt
trounced by your ex in mock trial last week.

24:26.191 --> 24:29.359
- You've been spying on me?
- Checking up on my son.

24:29.394 --> 24:31.728
None of your sons
are even speaking to you.

24:31.763 --> 24:34.665
Do you think that's all on us?

24:34.699 --> 24:38.602
Maybe you and Mom should take a
look at yourselves for a change.

24:38.636 --> 24:40.370
Maybe we should just
talk about the wire.

24:40.405 --> 24:45.008
I don't wanna talk about your damn wire!
I wanna talk to my son!

24:45.043 --> 24:47.311
Good night, Dad.

25:00.158 --> 25:02.092
- Well?
- I'm sorry, guys.

25:02.127 --> 25:06.130
The inspector is determined that she's not
gonna declare our house a historical landmark.

25:06.164 --> 25:09.066
And that's not
even the bad part.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.302
She also said the house
should be condemned.

25:12.337 --> 25:15.806
Condemned?! Is this
about the rat problem?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.609
Tell her we just recently
lost our pet snake.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.811
No, the whole house
is the problem.

25:20.845 --> 25:23.413
It either has to be fixed up
or it'll have to be torn down.

25:23.448 --> 25:27.451
- Torn down?! - The city can't risk
somebody getting hurt in there.

25:27.485 --> 25:30.721
- What about in here?
- Wait. Can we appeal?

25:30.755 --> 25:34.491
- My girlfriend makes straight As in law school.
- There is one solution.

25:34.526 --> 25:38.262
If Nationals won't pay for repairs,
suppose somebody just buys it from them,

25:38.296 --> 25:42.499
- fixes it up?
- Yeah, who'd give a bat's ass about KT?

25:42.534 --> 25:45.269
- I meant me.
- You'd do that?

25:45.303 --> 25:47.938
Well, I don't throw my money
around at just any cause,

25:47.972 --> 25:52.342
but if my house is about to hit the
wrecking ball, then yeah, I would do that.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.085
Lasker's buying the house.
We're saved!

26:02.120 --> 26:04.354
Goodbye, Shanty Tau!

26:05.623 --> 26:07.090
Oh, my God,
I didn't want to say anything,

26:07.125 --> 26:08.559
but I've been praying for it.

26:08.593 --> 26:10.527
Well, your prayers
have been answered.

26:16.234 --> 26:18.735
The Amazing Spider-Man
doesn't look too amazed.

26:18.770 --> 26:22.172
- Papa Parkes just saved the house.
- It's great.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.677
I'm just used to it. My dad saving the day
is kind of a recurring theme in my life.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.983
- You want to get out of here?
- You don't want to stay and celebrate?

26:33.017 --> 26:35.385
You know how many times
I've saved this dump?

26:35.420 --> 26:38.722
Besides, I know a sorority
where the food is hot

26:38.756 --> 26:40.691
and the women are cold.

26:41.893 --> 26:45.696
No. No, they're both hot.
Come on. Let's go.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.534
Adequate.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.869
More flowers over here.

26:52.904 --> 26:56.240
Who's on pillow poofing?
Poofier! Poofier!

26:56.274 --> 26:58.675
- Heather, I love that top.
- Thanks, Rebecca.

26:58.710 --> 27:02.012
It looks just like the one JWOWW wore when
she was beating up that girl in that club.

27:02.046 --> 27:05.582
Go change now. The Council
will be here any minute.

27:06.784 --> 27:08.919
You know, Becks,
in managing people,

27:08.953 --> 27:13.657
I've learned you get a lot more out of them
if you at least pretend to respect them.

27:13.691 --> 27:16.893
Oh, really? Is that why your IKI house
turned into a bunch of slutty losers

27:16.928 --> 27:20.130
and totally imploded? Was
it your management skills?

27:24.168 --> 27:26.003
Wow.

27:26.037 --> 27:28.572
The old me never said
anything that bitchy.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.808
Yes, you did. To Laura.
Sophomore year.

27:31.843 --> 27:33.610
Why do you think
she bites her nails?

27:33.645 --> 27:36.747
Hey. So this is pretty
exciting, isn't it?

27:36.781 --> 27:41.051
Four ZBZ presidents coming together to make
this the number one chapter in the nation.

27:41.085 --> 27:45.155
- Yeah, you're goin' down, Guam.
- OK, we have a small problem.

27:45.189 --> 27:47.591
- Bieber canceled.
- What?!

27:47.625 --> 27:49.726
<i>He's flying to New York
to do The View.</i>

27:49.761 --> 27:53.897
- Oh, my God.
- Well, how do you say no to Whoopi?

27:53.931 --> 27:56.600
- I knew this was too good to be true.
- OK, relax.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.569
- It's not the Golden Globes.
- No, it's just the Golden Lily.

27:59.604 --> 28:01.938
- It's bigger for us.
- That is so sad.

28:01.973 --> 28:05.342
You know what's sad, is you coming here
and messing with us all over again.

28:05.376 --> 28:07.177
- Once a sociopath, always...
- Rebecca...

28:07.211 --> 28:09.680
OK, the only reason you're even
president of this stupid house

28:09.714 --> 28:12.883
is because I courted you, poodle!

28:12.917 --> 28:14.851
Oh, my God,
what's happening to me?

28:14.886 --> 28:17.354
I don't know, I mean, you're
just so totally different.

28:17.388 --> 28:21.725
I was trying to help!

28:23.094 --> 28:26.363
- Madame President! Welcome!
- Hello!

28:26.397 --> 28:30.367
Thank you. Oh, sisters,
it is so wonderful to be here

28:30.401 --> 28:34.671
at such an impressive chapter.
And to think, Justin Bieber, too!

28:34.706 --> 28:38.041
- I can't wait!
- Oh, neither can we!

28:42.790 --> 28:44.925
Hey.

28:44.959 --> 28:48.562
I should have known you weren't helping
me out of the goodness of your heart.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.964
And I shouldn't have let my
feelings get in the way last night.

28:50.998 --> 28:54.968
I should have just stuck to
the facts like any good lawyer.

28:55.002 --> 28:57.104
Instead of caring
about my mom and dad.

28:57.138 --> 28:59.406
And Rebecca. That's what
you meant about putting

28:59.440 --> 29:02.042
personal stuff second, right?

29:03.644 --> 29:05.112
Whatever.

29:05.146 --> 29:07.814
It's probably a good thing that
you got that off your chest.

29:07.849 --> 29:11.585
You obviously wanted to show
them you don't need them.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.720
I don't need them.
But they already knew that.

29:13.755 --> 29:15.355
They've been stalking
me this whole time.

29:15.389 --> 29:19.359
I don't think they're stalking
you. It's more like checking up.

29:19.393 --> 29:22.295
It's like me with my wire.
I saw it through breakthroughs

29:22.330 --> 29:25.665
and setbacks, and one time,
it lanced my nipple.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.770
But even when it ticked
me off, I stuck with it.

29:29.804 --> 29:33.974
I'm not trying to control it,
I can't, it isn't mine anymore.

29:34.008 --> 29:35.942
I just want to make sure
that it'll be OK.

29:35.977 --> 29:40.313
- Is there a point in there?
- So you can either accept them for who they are

29:40.348 --> 29:45.385
and know that they care about you, or you
can keep them out of your life for good.

29:45.419 --> 29:49.022
- So, what are gonna do about your wire?
- My wire's gone.

29:49.056 --> 29:51.525
But you can still
get your parents back.

29:53.361 --> 29:55.228
Just let me bring
in someone else!

29:55.263 --> 29:57.030
<i>I think the guy from Castle is
visiting his grandmother in Toledo.</i>

29:57.064 --> 30:00.267
- I can make a call.
- In an hour? Just stop.

30:00.301 --> 30:02.869
You're not going to do that, just like
you were never going to get Bieber.

30:02.904 --> 30:04.805
I had Justin Bieber.

30:04.839 --> 30:07.374
Then how did you lose him?
You said you were his agent!

30:07.408 --> 30:11.044
OK, technically, I never said I was his agent.
Or an agent at all.

30:11.078 --> 30:13.814
I'm an assistant. And when he found
out the call was coming from me

30:13.848 --> 30:16.516
<i>and not one of the agents, the little
pipsqueak bailed for The View.</i>

30:16.551 --> 30:20.620
You let us think that you were his agent
and that this could've really happen!

30:20.655 --> 30:24.591
That is so typical you.
You haven't changed at all.

30:24.625 --> 30:27.460
So I embellished
a little to impress you,

30:27.495 --> 30:29.763
but you're so stuck seeing
everything the way you always did.

30:29.797 --> 30:32.432
Casey, you're the only person
who hasn't changed!

30:33.701 --> 30:36.169
Hey, everybody!
Kappa Tau is saved.

30:36.204 --> 30:38.371
Do you guys have any
of that honey ham I like?

30:41.943 --> 30:43.877
Proving my point.

30:43.911 --> 30:46.146
I can't believe you're
still dating this guy.

30:47.982 --> 30:50.617
And I can't believe
I actually still care.

30:50.651 --> 30:53.086
I so seriously need
to get back to LA.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.088
Oh, it's nice
to see you, too, Frannie.

30:55.122 --> 30:57.958
This is Pledge Spidey.
Please don't turn him to stone.

31:02.163 --> 31:05.232
We lost Bieber.
If we ever had him.

31:05.266 --> 31:08.768
No Bieber? Oh, that blows.

31:10.471 --> 31:12.405
I mean, I have a friend

31:12.440 --> 31:14.674
who wanted an autograph.

31:18.946 --> 31:20.747
What?

31:27.722 --> 31:29.422
Cap, can we borrow him?

31:34.762 --> 31:36.329
That concludes old business.

31:36.364 --> 31:38.231
Which brings us
to Saturday's mixer.

31:38.266 --> 31:42.802
I'm hearing the ladies of Tri-Pi are chomping
at the bit to score with you gentlemen.

31:42.837 --> 31:46.006
- What gentlemen?
- Oh, are we getting another one

31:46.040 --> 31:48.308
of those patented
Owens diatribes?

31:48.342 --> 31:51.711
If you don't like it here,
you can leave.

31:51.746 --> 31:57.217
- You know what? I think I will.
- Don't do that.

31:58.486 --> 32:00.620
Speaking of people
who can't take a hint...

32:00.655 --> 32:02.822
Can it, Prince Harry.

32:02.857 --> 32:06.259
You're gonna hear me out.
I trusted you guys as my brothers.

32:06.294 --> 32:08.795
And Trip, you were my big brother,
the most sacred role of all.

32:08.829 --> 32:12.632
And you lied to my face
every day for months.

32:12.667 --> 32:16.236
- You made me feel like an ass.
- A big one.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.839
Seriously, guys?

32:19.874 --> 32:23.343
Don't you see the guts that it took for
him to come down here and face you?

32:23.377 --> 32:25.879
That's courage!

32:25.913 --> 32:29.482
That is the Omega Chi
that I want to be a part of.

32:29.517 --> 32:32.419
Without it, we're just a bunch of
guys who drink beer and chase girls.

32:35.156 --> 32:39.092
Sometimes guys. Don't you
want to be more than that?

32:40.161 --> 32:42.295
To be honest,

32:42.330 --> 32:45.565
me and the rest of the pledges,

32:45.599 --> 32:48.001
we really got close to Dale,

32:48.035 --> 32:50.603
and we kinda miss him.

32:50.638 --> 32:54.307
Did anyone
ask the pledges to speak?

32:54.342 --> 32:59.145
Hold up. The pledges are gonna be
running this house in a few years.

32:59.180 --> 33:00.513
We should at least
hear them out.

33:00.548 --> 33:04.217
I'm just saying
Dale's a funny guy.

33:04.251 --> 33:06.820
He's cool.

33:08.255 --> 33:11.324
He didn't deserve
to get the boot.

33:11.359 --> 33:14.060
Especially the
way we booted him.

33:14.095 --> 33:17.697
Seriously? You guys...

33:23.137 --> 33:26.206
That was a wonderful poached
salmon, Mr. and Mrs. Chambers.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.209
- And you have a beautiful home.
- Well, thank you. You take care.

33:29.243 --> 33:31.978
Good luck with all
your future projects.

33:38.919 --> 33:41.921
So, uh, we still have a
little more negotiating to do.

33:41.956 --> 33:44.758
- Evan, please just stop...
- I'm not coming home for Thanksgiving.

33:44.792 --> 33:47.660
I will consider
every other Christmas,

33:47.695 --> 33:49.796
and I don't want your money.

33:51.265 --> 33:54.768
- What do you want?
- I want to be able to call

33:54.802 --> 33:57.270
and talk to you about my life,

33:57.304 --> 34:01.141
about how I screwed up
another relationship,

34:01.175 --> 34:05.045
and the fact that I have been
doing law school on my own,

34:05.079 --> 34:06.880
and how hard that's been.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.554
Deal.

34:17.725 --> 34:19.458
I'm proud of you, son.

34:24.565 --> 34:26.199
I love you guys.

34:29.536 --> 34:33.039
Uh, there is one more thing.

34:33.074 --> 34:36.576
Bieber! Bieber! Bieber!

34:36.610 --> 34:40.313
- Do you think this will work?
- I have no idea.

34:40.347 --> 34:43.283
I'm gonna pretend
you just said "hell, yes!"

34:43.317 --> 34:48.054
Y'all ready to save some frogs?!

35:15.116 --> 35:17.117
- Hey.
- It's going well, isn't it?

35:17.151 --> 35:21.921
Um, I think I
just signed FART as a client...

35:21.956 --> 35:24.424
whose name
I'm going to change tomorrow.

35:24.458 --> 35:29.863
So it's all
good, no thanks to Frannie.

35:29.897 --> 35:33.199
Can you believe she had the nerve to
say I'm the one who hasn't changed?

35:33.234 --> 35:36.102
- Well, you know Frannie...
- You definitely know her

35:36.137 --> 35:39.472
and you don't even seem to care about
all the horrible stuff she did to you.

35:39.507 --> 35:41.474
Well, it was a year ago.
I'm over it.

35:41.509 --> 35:44.277
- Why am I not?
- Because of ZBZ.

35:44.311 --> 35:47.180
Because you still really
care about this place.

35:47.214 --> 35:49.382
And ZBZ means a lot to me, too.

35:49.416 --> 35:53.019
It was a great chance to hang out
with you and all our friends,

35:53.053 --> 35:54.687
and being president was cool.

35:54.722 --> 36:00.160
Cool? For me,
it was... transformative.

36:00.194 --> 36:04.664
Is it wrong to want to give back to the place
that gave me so much of who I am today?

36:04.698 --> 36:08.968
No, it's not wrong, but how much
more are you planning to give?

36:16.894 --> 36:19.395
How amazing is that!
I even got us an autograph.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.098
I think he spelled his name
wrong, but hey, he's only 16.

36:23.567 --> 36:26.002
Can't wait to hear
your decision, Madame President.

36:26.537 --> 36:29.172
Oh, we'll be in touch.

36:31.875 --> 36:35.978
- Pretty awesome, big sis.
- I know, right?

36:39.049 --> 36:42.251
So you pulled off another
signature ZBZ caper.

36:43.053 --> 36:44.053
Yeah, I guess
you were right about me.

36:45.055 --> 36:47.390
- Some things never change.
- How could they?

36:48.325 --> 36:50.026
I've been gone a year,
I'm an assistant at CAA

36:51.395 --> 36:53.196
and I'm back here for 24 hours and
suddenly I'm calling people "poodle"

36:54.365 --> 36:55.431
and worrying about who did what
for some stupid Golden Lily.

36:56.667 --> 37:00.169
- It's not stupid.
- After a while, we have to let it go.

37:01.338 --> 37:03.639
You know, here, all of that
stuff, the mixers, the formals,

37:04.641 --> 37:06.843
the fraternity sweethearts...
it's life and death.

37:07.678 --> 37:11.614
But once you leave,
I mean really leave,

37:12.249 --> 37:14.317
it all becomes nice memories.

37:16.387 --> 37:17.754
For the most part.

37:18.956 --> 37:23.025
I guess you can't be nostalgic
for something you've never left.

37:25.796 --> 37:27.330
So I have to leave
early in the morning.

37:28.632 --> 37:32.101
Get back to the office, cover my
ass over the whole Bieber thing.

37:32.369 --> 37:34.404
Frannie?

37:35.973 --> 37:37.974
Email me when you
get back to LA.

37:42.179 --> 37:43.479
This is Frannie.

37:44.648 --> 37:47.550
Oh, I'm in Ohio. But tomorrow,
I'll be gone like LeBron.

37:48.118 --> 37:50.653
I know, right?

37:57.261 --> 37:58.828
What, you need
help with a satellite now?

38:00.264 --> 38:03.466
Apparently my advisor, Professor
Hastings, got a call from your dad.

38:04.902 --> 38:09.305
He said Chambers lnternational is
pouring a ton of money into my wire.

38:10.174 --> 38:13.509
They really believe in it.

38:13.944 --> 38:16.279
That's great news.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.182
Look, man, I really gotta study.
I'm kind of...

38:20.284 --> 38:22.452
He said I could be a part of
the project when I graduate.

38:22.653 --> 38:24.387
Wow.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.557
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

38:28.826 --> 38:30.126
Did you talk to them?
Well, apparently,

38:31.094 --> 38:32.829
your dad referred
to me as "Evan's friend."

38:33.697 --> 38:38.201
- Friend?
- Yeah, it creeped me out, too.

38:40.504 --> 38:43.372
Told you I could negotiate.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.508
Well, anyways, thanks.

38:45.809 --> 38:47.176
You, too.

38:55.886 --> 38:57.386
I'm gonna step down.

38:57.554 --> 39:00.790
They want Dale, so clearly I don't
have the support of the brothers.

39:01.158 --> 39:02.225
But you do.

39:02.893 --> 39:05.628
So you can be president again.

39:05.896 --> 39:08.030
Happy?

39:10.934 --> 39:12.335
No.

39:14.037 --> 39:15.537
You see, we're pledge brothers.

39:16.206 --> 39:18.808
And I remember when you weren't out to get
people, you actually had their backs.

39:19.343 --> 39:21.077
- Like who?
- Me.

39:22.279 --> 39:24.313
Like the time when I got flowers
in front of the entire house,

39:25.415 --> 39:28.017
and I was horrified, and you
said, "Flowers from a guy?

39:28.385 --> 39:30.086
That's cool."

39:30.988 --> 39:32.755
That set the tone
for the rest of the house.

39:33.824 --> 39:36.259
Everyone was cool, thanks to you.
I never forgot that.

39:36.994 --> 39:39.128
So all of my
"patented diatribes?"

39:39.930 --> 39:40.997
I just want what's
best for the house.

39:41.698 --> 39:43.900
For it to be
a real brotherhood.

39:44.334 --> 39:46.202
Like you used to.

39:48.038 --> 39:50.273
And I don't need to be
president to do that.

39:50.707 --> 39:52.475
So keep your job.

39:53.243 --> 39:54.644
Just try and remember
what it's for.

39:55.245 --> 39:58.514
And that's my last diatribe.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.359
Hey, house mom. The whole house
is going to Dobler's Friday night

40:11.595 --> 40:13.496
to wait for the Golden Lily vote.
You're coming, right?

40:14.031 --> 40:15.498
I think I'm gonna pass.

40:16.633 --> 40:18.868
I thought you'd be excited.
You were such a huge help.

40:20.137 --> 40:22.138
Oh, really? Even though you went
with another coach's playbook?

40:23.173 --> 40:25.174
Right, well, you don't
have to hire an exorcist.

40:26.543 --> 40:29.145
- I'm not turning into Frannie, OK?
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

40:30.013 --> 40:31.881
I might have used some
of her tactics.

40:33.216 --> 40:35.284
The difference is she never cared
about this house the way I do now.

40:36.253 --> 40:39.155
Now that what, you don't
have Evan to care about?

40:41.258 --> 40:42.558
That's not it at all.

40:42.859 --> 40:46.495
I'm just saying, there are
better ways to show you care.

40:47.431 --> 40:48.464
You wanted to show
that you were a good leader.

40:49.433 --> 40:52.735
I think maybe part of that
is leading by example.

40:53.637 --> 40:56.305
- I think I'm a great example.
- Mm-hm...

40:57.140 --> 40:58.708
Maybe I could tone it
down a little.

40:59.643 --> 41:00.142
But I can't promise
it won't happen again.

41:01.511 --> 41:06.315
I've had my share of psycho sorority
sister moments in my day,

41:07.250 --> 41:08.084
putting you through hell
most of your pledging.

41:08.885 --> 41:11.787
So enjoy this place
while you're here,

41:12.923 --> 41:14.590
because one day you're gonna
go off into the big bad world,

41:16.059 --> 41:21.664
and there won't be little sisters to
ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.

41:24.134 --> 41:26.235
Guess I'll do a shot for you
if we win the Lily.

41:26.637 --> 41:27.970
I know we'll...

41:29.039 --> 41:31.207
- I know you'll win it.
- Oh, we totally will.

41:32.709 --> 41:37.146
That is, if little Tyler Gentrie-Manning
ever wants to see his nana again.

41:39.950 --> 41:43.019
- Um...
- Kidding.

41:44.788 --> 41:48.858
Well, I'm off
to meet Ash for coffee.

41:49.393 --> 41:50.926
See you later, Becks.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.702
So I take it the evil empire
isn't using your wire

42:00.704 --> 42:02.405
to create nuclear warheads
or cause oil spills?

42:03.540 --> 42:05.274
Actually, they're gonna let me
work on it when I graduate.

42:06.109 --> 42:09.111
- That's great!
- In exchange for what?

42:09.746 --> 42:11.580
Your kidney?
Your first born?

42:12.249 --> 42:14.183
No, Evan totally helped me out.

42:15.385 --> 42:16.986
From one nerd to another, I'm
glad you got your wire back.

42:18.455 --> 42:21.290
I'm happy we got our house back.
Thank your dad for me when you talk to him.

42:22.092 --> 42:23.726
Yeah. My dad's the
hero once again.

42:24.895 --> 42:26.696
Hey, Cap, I got this letter
for you from the university.

42:27.531 --> 42:29.031
It goes in the
extra TP stack, right?

42:29.499 --> 42:31.300
No, I'll take it.

42:32.703 --> 42:33.269
What's up with him?

42:33.904 --> 42:35.638
- Daddy issues.
- I get it.

42:36.907 --> 42:40.509
It's like Evan. Sometimes guys
do stuff to piss off their dads.

42:47.150 --> 42:49.418
You know, the attacks on KT, it
all started rush night, right?

42:50.620 --> 42:52.555
- Yep. - And we were looking for
someone who had the know-how

42:53.790 --> 42:56.959
- to mess with Joshua Whopper.
- And you thought it was Dale?

42:57.661 --> 42:58.894
Because he's a big nerd, right.

42:59.896 --> 43:03.799
Well, maybe we were looking
at the wrong nerd.

43:05.736 --> 43:09.071
Maybe young Mr. Parkes...

43:12.409 --> 43:14.043
is our Villain X.

43:15.112 --> 43:19.281
Spidey? We can totally trust
him. He loves this house.

43:20.851 --> 43:22.084
Hey, don't you think?

43:22.285 --> 43:24.086
Cap?

43:26.123 --> 43:27.857
What's that?

43:28.925 --> 43:31.127
It's nothing.
