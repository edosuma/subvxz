that stole the bodies?

We thought, "Why not move up
to fresher game?"

36:58.799 --> 37:00.550
And we knew just where to start.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.682
Revenge. It's never over, is it Sam?

37:09.060 --> 37:14.105
First, it was John's cop friend,
and then his slut, and then his son.

37:14.273 --> 37:18.151
Then I called John,
but son of a bitch was already dead.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.905
So I guess you and Dean
will have to do instead.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.282
ADAM:
Dean won't interrupt us this time.

37:24.825 --> 37:28.036
We're gonna feed on you
nice and slow.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.496
Like we did with Adam.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.248
KATE:
Oh, and by the way.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.792
He really was your brother.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.339
You should know that.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.385
He was still alive
when we took our first bites.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.680
And he was a screamer.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.019
[YELLING]

37:53.187 --> 37:55.188
[GRUNTING]

38:06.659 --> 38:10.161
Sam, the more you struggle,
the faster you're gonna bleed out.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.332
So you might as well lie back
and relax.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.459
Hey!

38:18.045 --> 38:20.297
Dean, they're ghouls!

38:24.176 --> 38:26.511
Which means headshot.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.972
[GRUNTING]

39:13.351 --> 39:15.060
Dean!

39:29.909 --> 39:32.202
Here. Come on, come on, come on.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.122
Hang on. All right, here we go.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.208
Here we go.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.043
Here you go, buddy.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.174
All right, all right.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.843
Thank you.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.638
That's what family's for, right?

39:53.349 --> 39:55.475
Keep pressure on that.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.905
You sure we should do this?

40:09.865 --> 40:14.452
Ghouls didn't fake those pictures,
and they didn't fake Dad's journal.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.122
Adam was our brother.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.669
He died like a hunter,
he deserves to go out like one.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.175
Maybe we could bring him back.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.511
Get a hold of Cass, call in a favor.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.057
No. Adam's in a better place.

40:47.361 --> 40:51.072
You know, I finally get why
you and Dad butted heads so much.

40:52.908 --> 40:55.702
You two are practically
the same person.

40:56.745 --> 41:01.040
I mean, I worshiped the guy, you know?
I dressed like him, I acted like him.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.793
I listen to the same music.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.922
But you are more like him
than I will ever be.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.049
And I see that now.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.474
I'll take that as a compliment.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.732
You can take it any way you want.
