WEBVTT

00:05.310 --> 00:06.689
Yeah, right.

00:06.730 --> 00:08.550
Glasses on, he's Clark Kent.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.340
Glasses off, he's Superman.

00:10.430 --> 00:12.970
Like nobody would figure that out!

00:13.330 --> 00:16.260
I know, it is so obvious!

00:16.379 --> 00:17.760
How's my moustache?

00:18.150 --> 00:19.220
Perfect...

00:19.220 --> 00:20.790
Man, Mamaw should've been here by now,

00:20.790 --> 00:22.080
what time does her plane get in?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.150
Don't ask me, I offered to pick her up

00:24.150 --> 00:26.060
but the woman wouldn't even 
give me her flight number.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.730
You know, sometimes she can be

00:27.730 --> 00:31.020
as tight-lipped as a frog eating a peanut butter fly!

00:32.630 --> 00:35.260
Frog eating a peanut butter fly, get it?

00:35.960 --> 00:36.940
Is that a new one, dad?

00:36.940 --> 00:38.930
Yeah, I just made it up last night, you like it?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.450
Well, as long as it doesn't end up in one of my songs,

00:41.450 --> 00:43.000
I think it's brilliant.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.330
Darlin', I know you'd love to be here 
to give your grandma a hug,

00:46.330 --> 00:48.440
but I've got to get you to that photo shoot.

00:48.460 --> 00:51.040
Yeah, you're right, but... what's taking her so long?

00:54.110 --> 00:54.760
Sweet Pete,

00:54.760 --> 00:56.980
the woman drove here all the way from Tennessee?

00:57.020 --> 00:58.230
How do you know it's her?

00:59.510 --> 01:02.560
Get out of the driveway, you stupid cat!

01:03.200 --> 01:04.280
Just a hunch...

01:05.340 --> 01:07.010
I hope she didn't squish Fluffy!

01:07.490 --> 01:09.020
Mamaw!

01:09.370 --> 01:12.840
Oh! Don't squeeze too hard,

01:12.840 --> 01:15.330
I've been sucking down iced tea since Albuquerque.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.260
You drove this rust bucket
 all the way across the country?

01:19.740 --> 01:21.640
If you're in such a hurry to risk your life,

01:21.640 --> 01:24.410
why don't you just walk into
 bear country wearing fish pants?

01:25.670 --> 01:29.130
Funny, I don't remember 
sitting on your egg for three weeks

01:29.130 --> 01:31.490
but apparently I hatched a chicken.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.720
Burn! Up top.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.310
I just care about you, that's all.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.950
Oh, dad, don't worry.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.110
Mamaw wouldn't drive anything that isn't safe.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.610
And besides, this car's a classic,

01:42.610 --> 01:44.150
they don't make 'em like this anymore.

01:45.450 --> 01:47.530
Probably because it's against the law!

01:47.600 --> 01:49.130
Oh, hush!

01:49.200 --> 01:51.230
I'll have you know that Loretta here drove

01:51.230 --> 01:53.390
your grandpa and me to Hoover Dam on our honeymoon...

01:53.590 --> 01:55.340
took your grandpa to work for forty years

01:55.340 --> 01:57.790
and me to the hospital the day your daddy was born.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.370
Well, almost... he was in such a big hurry

02:00.370 --> 02:02.750
he popped out right there on that front seat.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.360
Speaking of being in a hurry,

02:09.360 --> 02:11.410
I've got to get this girl to a photo shoot.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.510
Not to worry, I will just drive you.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.490
No!

02:15.810 --> 02:17.670
Aargh... 'member... you've got eight hundred miles

02:17.670 --> 02:18.730
of iced tea to take care of.

02:18.810 --> 02:20.640
Not to mention that over-ripe bag

02:20.640 --> 02:22.530
of cherries that I bought in Barstow...

02:23.220 --> 02:25.610
You know what, I'm just going to move

02:25.610 --> 02:27.450
this out of the way so I'm not blockin' the garage...

02:28.810 --> 02:30.850
Well, hold on Mamaw, let's get your bags.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.830 --> 02:45.160
Maybe I should stop using Uncle Earl's homemade gas...

02:45.690 --> 02:47.070
Ya' think?

03:43.110 --> 03:44.850
I promise, Hannah'll be there tomorrow.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.710
Well, thanks to that old clunker of yours

03:47.710 --> 03:50.910
I just had to cancel a very
 important photo shoot for Miley.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.740
Well what would you like me to do?

03:52.890 --> 03:54.730
Spank Loretta on the trunk and

03:54.730 --> 03:56.730
send her to the garage without supper?

03:57.390 --> 03:59.230
I was thinking more like, shoot it, stuff it

03:59.230 --> 04:00.710
and hang it over the fireplace.

04:01.270 --> 04:02.870
I heard that!

04:02.950 --> 04:04.530
I meant, shoot!

04:04.610 --> 04:05.740
it's great to have you here

04:05.740 --> 04:07.320
hanging out and stuff.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.690
Fireplace?

04:11.320 --> 04:12.420
Let's face it, mom.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.760
The steering's loose, the breaks are mushy

04:14.810 --> 04:17.040
and I've seen better transmissions on tricycles!

04:17.040 --> 04:17.649
Oh, yeah?

04:17.880 --> 04:20.060
Well at least my car keeps her spare tire

04:20.060 --> 04:23.100
in her trunk instead of hanging out over her belt, porky!

04:23.570 --> 04:26.870
I am not porky! And don't you go changing the subject.

04:26.870 --> 04:27.500
Well, I'm sorry,

04:27.500 --> 04:30.340
I'm tired of hearing you raggin' on your birthplace.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.690
Now, if you will excuse me,

04:33.690 --> 04:35.310
I am going to go upstairs and unpack.

04:36.550 --> 04:39.010
Wow, I think finally got it all of.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.600
Guess I just didn't get it all out...

04:44.630 --> 04:46.600
Oh, Miley sweetie, I'm so sorry

04:46.600 --> 04:49.570
you were on the wrong end of one of Loretta's car toots.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.800
That's OK, Mamaw...

04:51.570 --> 04:52.790
Soot happens.

04:52.870 --> 04:56.600
Well, I'm glad to see that not everybody in this family

04:56.600 --> 04:59.240
blames a poor, innocent car on all of their troubles.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.520
Yeah, of course not, I love that car!

05:03.610 --> 05:04.650
I hate that car.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.410
She can not keep driving that thing, it's not safe.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.500
Honey, I've been trying to get her to sell it for 20 years.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.590
Every time I break it up all she does is tell me I'm fat.

05:13.850 --> 05:16.340
Not one single word about how great my hair looks!

05:16.820 --> 05:19.810
Well, I think it's time to stop trying and start buying.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.180
I'm telling you, 'Miles, she loves that car.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.150
Yeah, and she also thought Jackson

05:24.150 --> 05:25.990
was the most beautiful baby in the world...

05:26.140 --> 05:27.280
'til I came along.

05:27.580 --> 05:28.770
Excuse me?

05:29.030 --> 05:30.110
Come on, let's face it son,

05:30.120 --> 05:31.170
you were the first grandchild,

05:31.170 --> 05:32.500
she was ready to love about anything.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.660
Come on, let's face it dad...

05:34.950 --> 05:36.190
- you're fat.  
- Hey!

05:37.500 --> 05:39.590
Come on guys, we're getting off subject here.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.000
She'll forget all about Loretta as soon as

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
she sees that bright, shiny new car.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.900
New car?

05:46.070 --> 05:48.140
What's wrong with certified pre-owned,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.260
I mean it comes with all the warranties,

05:50.260 --> 05:51.310
and it's less expensive...

05:51.320 --> 05:52.130
Dad!

05:52.600 --> 05:53.290
Fine...

05:53.780 --> 05:56.300
Trust me, the look on her face will be priceless.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.870
Not quite the look I was going for...

06:02.680 --> 06:04.340
Where is Loretta?

06:05.410 --> 06:06.740
Well, mom, we traded her in.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.200
For this brand new car!

06:09.810 --> 06:11.030
Yeah, that's right,

06:11.060 --> 06:15.740
this brand new beauty comes with hand-tooled leather interior.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.380
Oohhh!!

06:17.380 --> 06:20.360
Nation-wide navigation with real time traffic.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.480
Aarghhh...

06:22.630 --> 06:24.110
But wait, there's more!

06:24.120 --> 06:26.250
Oh no there ain't.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.810
How could you?

06:28.160 --> 06:29.250
It was her idea.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.090
Hey, big guy. What can I get you?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.690
I can't decide between the hot dog and the nachos.

06:42.940 --> 06:46.800
Well, how about I put the hot dog in the nachos,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.250
throw a little jalapeno over that action, and boom!

06:49.530 --> 06:53.140
That's not-cho ordinary dog, dawg

06:53.150 --> 06:55.350
- Awesome! 
- I know!

06:56.610 --> 06:57.620
I 'gotta admit,

06:57.620 --> 07:00.660
the whole Mr. Happy thing of yours is so inspiring,

07:00.730 --> 07:02.770
makes me wish I had a magical horse.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.450
Magical horse, why?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.970
So it could kick your teeth in!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.970
oh yeah... like a "magical" horse would do that.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.270
Mine would.

07:13.870 --> 07:16.000
and then it would poop gold coins!

07:18.910 --> 07:21.950
Anyway, since you've been working here,

07:21.950 --> 07:24.440
my profits have been up two-hundred percent.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.320
Wait... does that mean that I'm getting a raise?

07:29.300 --> 07:31.170
How can I say this so you'll understand

07:31.550 --> 07:35.040
you'll never get a raise! Never, never, EVER!

07:35.990 --> 07:38.640
It's OK. I make a fortune in tips anyway.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.490
Not anymore!

07:43.810 --> 07:45.960
Oh, wait, is your mom still a cop?

07:45.990 --> 07:47.250
Oh, yes...

07:49.090 --> 07:51.380
Let me just get rid of these pesky fingerprints...

07:53.110 --> 07:54.150
Hey, Olli-pop!

07:54.180 --> 07:55.300
Hey, Lily-pop!

07:55.530 --> 07:57.400
Happy one-hundred day-anniversary!

07:58.420 --> 08:01.320
Aargh, yeah... right back at you.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.040
You forgot, didn't you?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.850
What? No! Of course not, in fact...

08:05.940 --> 08:07.820
I put a lot of thought into your gift.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.030
Go buy yourself something nice...

08:13.430 --> 08:15.600
How could you forget our special day?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.670
Really Olli-pop, how could you?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.790
I feel your pain, girlfriend!

08:20.810 --> 08:22.640
OK, listen, I'm sorry.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.420
Happy hundred-day anniversary!

08:24.420 --> 08:25.380
Oh, just forget it!

08:25.510 --> 08:27.700
I did forget it, you got mad at me...

08:30.370 --> 08:33.520
No, no, no! Don't you cutesy face me.

08:33.809 --> 08:34.600
OK...

08:35.270 --> 08:38.299
OK?! That's how you make me feel better?

08:38.380 --> 08:41.590
Well, the cutesy face didn't work,
 what do you want me to do?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.409
Go to the card store and look in

08:43.409 --> 08:45.420
the hundred day-anniversary section and...

08:45.480 --> 08:47.740
oh, wait a second, they don't have one of those,

08:47.740 --> 08:49.540
why, because it's stupid!

08:51.660 --> 08:53.220
I'll tell you what's stupid!

08:53.220 --> 08:55.040
A hundred and one days with you!

09:01.520 --> 09:04.620
See, this is exactly why I don't have a girlfriend.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.590
Who asked you?

09:12.820 --> 09:15.330
Wow. I haven't seen her this upset since

09:15.330 --> 09:17.700
that Super Bowl Sunday that grandpa used her bra

09:17.700 --> 09:19.130
as a chip and dip server.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.910
Somebody should go talk to her.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.570
Somebody with wisdom and sensitivity.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.350
Whew. That leaves me out.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.040
The boy's right, Mile. Good luck.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.840
Me? She's your mother!

09:35.840 --> 09:38.720
That woman'd skin my hide. She wouldn't hit a girl.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.450
Fine.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.040
Not in the mood, Miley.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.010
How'd you know it was me?

09:49.440 --> 09:52.120
Because the other two don't have the guts.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.600
Tell me about it.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.860
Who do you think kills all the spiders around here?

09:58.990 --> 10:03.730
Mamaw, we really are sorry. 
We thought you'd love a new car.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.630
Well, you thought wrong.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.790
But, Loretta's just so old and run down.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.250
Maybe to you.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.760
But to me, that ol' girl is like part of the family.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.800
When I get into that car,

10:19.840 --> 10:22.010
I can still smell your Grandpa's hair tonic.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.040
I can still hear your daddy shouting "don't leave me"

10:26.040 --> 10:28.650
as I shove him out the door 
on his first day of kindergarten.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.790
That car is like half of my life.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.610
I'm sorry, Mamaw. I just never thought of it that way.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.390
Well, there's the problem. None of you thought.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.840
So, if you will excuse me,

10:40.840 --> 10:43.000
I'm gonna go take a little walk by the ocean.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.310
Unless you Californians thought it was too old

10:46.310 --> 10:48.450
and replaced it with that fancy mineral water

10:48.450 --> 10:50.510
that tastes like you washed an orange in it.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.350
Yeah, I understand. Thank you very much.

10:59.970 --> 11:02.080
So, are they gonna take the car back,

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
Or, will me, somebody, me, have to keep it, me?

11:05.750 --> 11:07.690
Sorry you, they said they'd take it back, you,

11:07.690 --> 11:09.950
so somebody's out of luck, you.

11:11.410 --> 11:14.080
So, great! We just gotta go down and get Loretta back.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.610
I'd love to, but the problem is

11:15.610 --> 11:17.450
they've already sold Loretta to the junk yard.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.390
So, we go buy her back.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.110
I mean I wouldn't call that a problem.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.770
Here's your car.

11:27.530 --> 11:30.180
Now this, I call a problem.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.180
We don't know for sure that this is Loretta.

11:40.190 --> 11:41.800
There's only one way to find out.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.940
Yup, Grandpa's hair tonic.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.830
And one of Mamaw's half-eaten butterscotch candies.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.950
This is why we usually leave him at home.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.600
Uh-huh. Say now, did you want this delivered

11:59.600 --> 12:01.520
or did you wanna drive it outta here?

12:04.420 --> 12:06.660
Sorry, just a little junk yard humor.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.410
Seriously, delivery is a hundred bucks.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.410
Kids, there's only one thing left to do...

12:12.950 --> 12:14.650
You and I are going camping.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.120
Miley, you call us when she leaves.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.740
Thank you, chicken and chicken by-products.

12:20.970 --> 12:24.040
You know, there's gotta be an 
intelligent and logical solution.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.640
Ooh, I got it.

12:26.690 --> 12:29.640
How about we pour some water on it until it pops up.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.920
You know, like one of those cute little

12:31.920 --> 12:33.200
spongy dinosaur thingies?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.940
Let me get this straight...

12:39.440 --> 12:42.710
You generally leave him at home, but you bring her?

12:43.560 --> 12:44.830
Welcome to my world.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.190
Just face it, Miles, it's over.

12:48.190 --> 12:49.880
All right? It's not like the time you went to

12:49.880 --> 12:52.280
Washington and I forgot to feed your goldfish

12:52.280 --> 12:54.520
so I replaced it with a look-alike and you never knew.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.490
You flushed Scaley Joel Osment?

12:58.600 --> 13:02.480
Hey, hey... Now, if you folks are lookin' to replace this car,

13:02.480 --> 13:05.170
I've got one in the back, looks just like her.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.560
Hey, Dad, that does look like Loretta.

13:08.630 --> 13:10.760
I don't know. Something about it don't feel right.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.320
Well, there he is, Robby Stewart,

13:14.320 --> 13:17.480
the porky son who broke his mamma's heart!

13:18.840 --> 13:19.920
We'll take it.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.230
Where's the money? There's no money in here!

13:34.990 --> 13:37.450
It's been a slow day.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.030
What're you talking about? The beach is packed.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.950
What could possibly be keeping the people away?

13:45.370 --> 13:46.550
Excuse me, mister.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.740
What do you want?

13:49.540 --> 13:51.720
- A hot dog?  - Why?

13:52.210 --> 13:53.510
I love hot dogs.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.870
Well, it doesn't matter what you 
love, because sooner or later

13:57.870 --> 14:00.000
your precious little hot dog's gonna turn on you

14:00.010 --> 14:02.760
because you forgot its stupid 100 Day-a'versary!

14:02.900 --> 14:06.430
- OK, I'll have nachos. 
- They hate you, too.

14:06.550 --> 14:07.740
Live with it.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.090
What a freak.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.190
What are you doing? I heard change in his pocket.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.190
Change that should've been mine. Snap out of it!

14:19.190 --> 14:20.890
I want Mr. Happy back.

14:21.330 --> 14:25.700
You know what? Mr. Happy doesn't live in here anymore.

14:27.410 --> 14:28.410
I quit.

14:29.050 --> 14:32.330
You can't quit. You need to get back here and get happy.

14:32.390 --> 14:34.070
Rico, what's the point?

14:35.270 --> 14:36.850
What's the point?

14:37.140 --> 14:39.810
Money. What other point is there?

14:43.110 --> 14:45.490
OK, fine. Go!

14:46.000 --> 14:47.470
I don't need you.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.730
I can be Mr. Happy.

14:52.070 --> 14:54.590
Again, who asked you?

15:00.870 --> 15:03.430
This is in way better shape than Loretta.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.350
Yeah, what kind of junk dealer are you?

15:05.370 --> 15:08.180
Hey, I'm sorry, this is the worst I can do.

15:08.270 --> 15:12.310
Hollywood... The longer I'm here, the weirder it gets.

15:12.770 --> 15:14.540
You know what, kids? It's all right.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.130
A few dents, some scrapes, scratches,

15:17.130 --> 15:19.480
40 years of assorted smells and

15:19.860 --> 15:21.580
we'll be able to give the old rattle trap

15:21.580 --> 15:22.950
back to the old rattle trap.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.240
She called me fat.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.760
But what about Mamaw's seat covers and

15:28.760 --> 15:31.400
fluffy steering wheel thingy and all the other stuff?

15:31.570 --> 15:34.780
Oh, I took that all out before I crushed her.

15:34.990 --> 15:35.970
I've got it right here.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.230
You are a life saver.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.250
I just like to make people happy.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.880
That'll be fifty bucks.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.600
Fifty bucks? Who's that making happy?

15:45.610 --> 15:46.360
Me.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.060
Come on man, we need this stuff.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.020
Sorry, I did not know that.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.760
Let's call it a hundred.

15:55.630 --> 15:57.390
Way to haggle, Porky.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.120
Ah! There.

16:08.430 --> 16:11.530
Now it looks just like the time I snuck out after curfew

16:11.530 --> 16:13.580
and fell all the way from the second floor window.

16:13.590 --> 16:16.010
Landed right on the ol' keister.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.560
Ever since then, this cheek's been

16:18.560 --> 16:21.060
just a little flatter than the other one.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.790
Wait, so you, uh... you snuck out after curfew?

16:24.990 --> 16:26.610
Did I say snuck out?

16:26.620 --> 16:28.730
I meant I was painting the side of the house.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.650
Well, I heard a little rumor that

16:31.650 --> 16:34.330
Miley might be painting the side 
of the house Saturday night.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.850
I'm just sayin'.

16:36.810 --> 16:39.370
Now, to take care of the time Mamaw got

16:39.370 --> 16:41.600
a little too close to the town police car.

16:44.810 --> 16:45.900
Nice!

16:45.980 --> 16:49.280
OK, I think I got everything that we need.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.590
I've got:

16:52.420 --> 16:54.530
Grandpa's hair tonic.

16:56.810 --> 17:00.280
And, ketchup for in-between the seats.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.079
Now, mix it all together.

17:08.609 --> 17:09.540
There we go.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.230
And just a little orange soda
 for sticky-ing up the dash.

17:16.579 --> 17:17.660
You know, this is comin' together

17:17.660 --> 17:19.500
a whole lot better than I thought it would.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.470
There's something missing...

17:23.690 --> 17:24.710
You're right.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.579
It's the subtle hint of cat pee in the back seat.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.820
I'm way ahead of ya, Daddy.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.360
Say hello to Burt.

17:33.530 --> 17:37.540
And just FYI, that's his second bowl of milk, so

17:37.650 --> 17:39.880
he should be ready to spring a leak any minute.

17:43.810 --> 17:47.040
Yeah, that's brilliant, but he's not doing anything.

17:47.810 --> 17:50.190
Well, maybe he just needs a little encouragement.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.550
Go, Burt, go! Go, Burt, go!

17:53.710 --> 17:56.150
Go, Burt, go! Go, Burt, go!

17:56.270 --> 17:58.150
Go... Burt!

18:00.390 --> 18:02.000
You know how I'm always complaining

18:02.000 --> 18:04.500
the three of us don't do enough stuff together?

18:05.620 --> 18:06.930
I'm done with that.

18:12.810 --> 18:15.220
Rico, Rico, have you seen Oliver?

18:15.350 --> 18:17.030
Or should I say the most wonderful,

18:17.030 --> 18:18.990
beautiful, sensitive guy in the whole world?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.370
Whoa, what happened?

18:20.480 --> 18:22.230
I thought you never wanted to see him again.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.430
Oh, that was before he wrote me this.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.770
"Lilly, my soul, my life, my love...

18:28.840 --> 18:31.380
...my angel sent from heaven above...

18:31.620 --> 18:33.680
...without you near my heart is broken...

18:33.860 --> 18:36.540
...best regards, Oliver Oken."

18:38.610 --> 18:41.140
- Who knew he was so deep?  - I know.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.790
There he is! Run to him, child, run!

18:45.810 --> 18:47.320
Oh, Oliver, I'm so sorry!

18:47.500 --> 18:50.300
- You are?  - Yes, and I forgive you.

18:50.310 --> 18:52.110
- You do?  - Yes, and I love your poem.

18:52.470 --> 18:53.570
My poem?

18:53.810 --> 18:56.670
Yes, the beautiful poem you
 wrote her, expressing your love.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.300
You?

18:59.650 --> 19:02.330
- I am so happy. 
- Well, then I'm happy, too!

19:02.510 --> 19:04.830
Yeah, we are all happy!

19:05.180 --> 19:07.810
Happy, happy, happy. Now get back to work.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.690
OK.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.100
I'll miss you, Ollie-pop!

19:10.100 --> 19:11.770
I'll miss you, too, Lilly-pop!

19:16.520 --> 19:18.600
Another reason I don't have a girlfriend.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.300
Oh, get a life, people!

19:28.510 --> 19:30.730
- Mamaw! Come here!  - Come on, Mamaw!

19:30.810 --> 19:32.910
What in tarnation is all the noise?

19:33.930 --> 19:37.810
Loretta! You're back!

19:43.230 --> 19:45.660
Oh, I missed you.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.770
Sorry we tried to separate you two.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.300
Oh, you were just doing what you thought was right...

19:50.400 --> 19:53.340
...even though you were wronger than tofu bacon.

19:54.150 --> 19:56.950
I mean, really, what is the point of that stuff?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.480
She looks great, doesn't she?

19:59.570 --> 20:01.060
I mean, look at that scrape.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.330
If that doesn't say "Loretta," I don't know what does.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.050
Jackson.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.370
All I'm saying is, you can't duplicate a scratch like that.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.120
It'd take a genius.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.290
Yep, and we don't got any of those here,

20:11.310 --> 20:12.580
so how about we go inside

20:12.580 --> 20:13.890
and have a good laugh about it, huh?

20:13.890 --> 20:17.020
I'll start... Walk.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.060
You go on ahead, son.

20:19.060 --> 20:21.310
I just want to have a moment with my girl here.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.560
Take all the time you need.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.980
- Check out the dent! Ow...  
- Let's go.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.200
You know, don't you?

20:39.190 --> 20:40.750
Of course I do.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.650
I really am sorry, Mamaw.

20:45.650 --> 20:48.010
We tried to get her back. It was just...

20:48.180 --> 20:49.370
we were too late.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.580
It's OK. Get on in here.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.130
Are you sure you're not mad?

21:00.340 --> 21:03.420
How can I be mad at a family that loves me so much

21:03.420 --> 21:05.790
they'd go to all this trouble to 
help me hold onto something

21:05.820 --> 21:07.380
I should've gotten rid of when I tossed

21:07.380 --> 21:09.090
my spandex disco pants.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.150
- I wish I could've seen those.  - Yeah, you do.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.050
I was foxy.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.430
But what about all your memories?

21:19.730 --> 21:21.230
I still have those.

21:21.230 --> 21:23.400
And now thanks to you all, I have another one.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.190
Oh, sweetie. You're not crying, are you?

21:28.230 --> 21:31.320
No. It's just... that cat did a good job.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.220
Thanks for changing your mind about the car, Ma.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.690
I'm gonna feel a whole lot better

21:39.690 --> 21:41.140
knowing you're traveling in this.

21:42.350 --> 21:44.120
And we really are sorry about Loretta.

21:44.190 --> 21:46.130
Oh, I know you are. And don't you fret none.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.100
I will always have her in my heart.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.940
-We'll miss you, Mamaw. 
-I'll miss you, too, babies.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.550
Well, I guess I'd better hit the road.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.120
Hey, you don't have to worry about directions.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.060
I already programmed the GPS.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.920
You won't need a map the whole way there.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.190
- Oh! Bye!  
- Drive safe, Mamaw.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.900
<i>In 50 feet, turn right</i>.

22:05.920 --> 22:10.210
- Well, thank you, darlin'.
 - <i>In 45 feet, turn right</i>.

22:10.210 --> 22:13.940
- OK, I got it.
 - <i>In 40 feet, turn right</i>.

22:13.950 --> 22:15.690
You gonna do this all the way back to Tennessee?

22:15.880 --> 22:19.440
- <i>In 35 feet, turn right</i>.
- Oh, shut up!

22:20.270 --> 22:23.150
You programmed it so she
 couldn't turn it off, didn't you?

22:23.210 --> 22:24.730
Teach her to call me fat.
