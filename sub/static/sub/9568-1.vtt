20:07.988 --> 20:11.627
Er, sorry.
She's still a bit fragile.

20:11.628 --> 20:15.627
That, erm, grief in Oxford, right?

20:16.268 --> 20:18.787
You... you know about that?

20:18.788 --> 20:22.667
Yeah, Franks told us everything.
Really tough, huh?

20:22.668 --> 20:26.667
Yeah, it was.
Sorry, I need to check on dinner.

20:27.468 --> 20:31.467
I'll be back in two shakes.

20:33.628 --> 20:37.627
They got married in an army uniform.
Twisted or what?

20:54.468 --> 20:58.027
Mini, that's naughty!

20:58.028 --> 21:00.027
What the fuck?

21:00.028 --> 21:04.027
Oh, my God, she's been fraped!

21:07.508 --> 21:10.147
Come on, Mini, this isn't fair!

21:10.148 --> 21:13.307
Yeah, but look at that one!

21:14.828 --> 21:17.747
We do not lock doors in this family.

21:17.748 --> 21:19.667
It's the toilet.

21:19.668 --> 21:21.107
Well, I haven't heard

21:21.108 --> 21:25.107
any lavatorial what-have-yous
whatsoever, clever clogs.

21:28.068 --> 21:32.067
Chin up. Your mates await!

21:39.828 --> 21:42.187
What the hell are you doing
looking at those?

21:42.188 --> 21:45.867
It just came on
when Grace brushed past it.

21:45.868 --> 21:48.587
We're really, really sorry.
We're friends.

21:48.588 --> 21:51.787
This is not fair. She had a really
shit time at the last school.

21:51.788 --> 21:52.867
We were just looking.

21:52.868 --> 21:54.747
I don't care, this was a real...

21:54.748 --> 21:56.027
What the fuck?!

21:56.028 --> 22:00.027
I can't believe you looked at them!
Please don't say anything.

22:00.468 --> 22:03.227
Please, promise. Promise me!

22:03.228 --> 22:04.147
Yeah, Franky, we promise.

22:04.148 --> 22:04.907
Yes, Franky, of course.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.907
Cross our hearts.

22:09.428 --> 22:12.467
Bye.

22:12.468 --> 22:15.267
Dicksplash!

22:15.268 --> 22:18.947
Geoff, did you hear that? She just
called her dad "dicksplash".

22:18.948 --> 22:21.507
Franky, only I can call Jeff that.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.907
Great, gold star for discipline(!)

22:23.908 --> 22:25.707
I was aiming for levity.

22:25.708 --> 22:28.547
You need to start trusting.
No person is an island.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.107
You're going to have to make
an effort this time.

22:31.108 --> 22:35.107
Fuck off.

When I was your age, I bought
myself a Sergio Tacchini tracksuit

25:01.621 --> 25:03.700
and a sovereign ring
for every finger.

25:03.701 --> 25:05.180
You wore sovereigns?

25:05.181 --> 25:06.900
I even had a Playboy one.

25:06.901 --> 25:09.620
I didn't get any more shit
off the estate after that,

25:09.621 --> 25:11.580
but I developed
so much testosterone,

25:11.581 --> 25:13.340
I didn't know what to do.

25:13.341 --> 25:14.700
So I joined the TA.

25:14.701 --> 25:17.740
And when our eyes met

Adoring the new you.

26:05.541 --> 26:07.940
Yeah, it's well original, Franks.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.300
What's it called. Lidl La Roux?

26:10.301 --> 26:11.540
Mini...

26:11.541 --> 26:15.540
I'm sorry, but you can't come
to my soiree like that.

26:15.581 --> 26:16.620
Why?

26:16.621 --> 26:20.620
Cos... Cos I mean, it looks like
she's been gang-raped by clowns!

26:28.421 --> 26:31.100
What about that gorge dress
I got you?

26:31.101 --> 26:31.900
I don't think it's...

26:31.901 --> 26:35.020
Soz, don't speak mumble. What?

26:35.021 --> 26:37.020
It isn't right.

26:37.021 --> 26:40.180
Why not?

26:40.181 --> 26:41.860
Come on, why not?

26:41.861 --> 26:44.220
Do I look like
a bulimic fucking Barbie?

26:46.301 --> 26:49.380
Shit.

26:49.381 --> 26:52.980
I'm sorry.

26:52.981 --> 26:56.980
Fine. It's fine.

26:57.501 --> 27:01.500
See you guys in class.

27:01.701 --> 27:03.220
Nick.

27:08.181 --> 27:12.180
And it was my cell-mate, Peter,
who taught me to read

27:13.061 --> 27:16.700
and it really helped block out
the flashbacks from that...

27:16.701 --> 27:20.700
gruesome night.

27:22.021 --> 27:23.900
Who's this?

27:23.901 --> 27:24.940
Your mum?

27:28.221 --> 27:30.020
No.

27:30.021 --> 27:34.020
This is my mum, sandwiched
between Dickens and Nabokov.

27:35.021 --> 27:39.020
This is the original punk -
Charlotte fucking Bronte!

27:39.221 --> 27:43.220
This is my ID.
Do you get me?

27:44.981 --> 27:48.580
Yeah? Good.

27:48.581 --> 27:52.020
Now, I asked you to prepare
and discuss to the class

27:52.021 --> 27:54.260
whether choice truly shapes us.

27:54.261 --> 27:57.540
Thank you, Richard,
please resume picking your hole.

27:57.541 --> 28:00.380
Oi. Fresh meat.

28:00.381 --> 28:04.380
You're up.

28:10.661 --> 28:11.980
All right?

28:11.981 --> 28:14.860
Um, yeah, so...

28:14.861 --> 28:17.780
Fuck... Sorry.

28:17.781 --> 28:21.780
No. Fuck is good. Fuck is poetic
expression for the unsayable soul.

28:24.981 --> 28:26.140
Carry on.

28:26.141 --> 28:30.140
Right. Yeah. So, um...

28:30.541 --> 28:33.460
Fucking. Erm... Yeah.

28:33.461 --> 28:37.100
Basically if... If you can, like,

28:37.101 --> 28:40.260
choose your identity cos...

28:40.261 --> 28:42.300
I tried today

28:42.301 --> 28:46.300
and now I feel,
kind of, less like me

28:47.861 --> 28:50.300
and I mean I'm not exactly
over the moon

28:50.301 --> 28:53.020
about being me
in the first place, but now...

28:53.021 --> 28:55.700
Now I think...

28:55.701 --> 28:59.700
I kind of like it less
than trying not to be me.

29:00.781 --> 29:04.580
Um, cos I just want to, like,

29:04.581 --> 29:08.580
just be.

29:09.541 --> 29:13.540
Yes, we can!

29:13.861 --> 29:15.420
Well done, Fitzgerald,

29:15.421 --> 29:18.700
you just took a big dump on
the grave of Jean-Paul Sartre.

29:18.701 --> 29:22.500
Sorry, Sir. Rugger practice, like,
over-ran and shit.

29:22.501 --> 29:26.180
Your turn to pick up
the soap, was it?

29:26.181 --> 29:29.500
We use shower gel
in the free world, Sir.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.500
Sit the fuck down, meatheads.

29:36.061 --> 29:38.940
Next up...

30:10.941 --> 30:12.940
What's the big joke?

30:12.941 --> 30:16.940
You...Franks.

30:19.741 --> 30:22.700
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

30:22.701 --> 30:26.700
I thought something like this might
happen. That's why I tried to help.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.220
You promised.

30:30.221 --> 30:31.380
Oh, Franks...

30:31.381 --> 30:35.380
Franky...

30:37.221 --> 30:41.220
Looks like someone won't be
coming to my party. Shame.

30:43.461 --> 30:45.980
What?

30:45.981 --> 30:48.940
Fuck you!

30:48.941 --> 30:50.940
Fuck you all!

31:08.021 --> 31:11.260
Fuck you, you bitches!

31:11.261 --> 31:15.260
Fuck! You!

31:35.341 --> 31:37.140
Go!

31:37.141 --> 31:41.140
Go away, please!

31:48.341 --> 31:52.340
I said, "go away"!

31:58.501 --> 31:59.540
Is it real?

31:59.541 --> 32:03.540
Do you want to find out?

32:04.941 --> 32:07.420
It's a re-drilled replica.

32:07.421 --> 32:11.300
It shoots bullets, OK?

32:11.301 --> 32:13.060
Bullets for bitches?

32:13.061 --> 32:16.700
What?

32:16.701 --> 32:18.020
Is this how you have fun?

32:18.021 --> 32:22.020
Can you just leave me alone?

32:29.941 --> 32:31.380
Go on, then.

32:31.381 --> 32:35.380
I don't have to take
this shit any more.

32:35.621 --> 32:39.620
No, you don't.

32:39.861 --> 32:43.860
Bang.

32:47.221 --> 32:49.300
You're beautiful.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.340
No.

32:50.341 --> 32:53.980
No, I'm not. I'm...

32:53.981 --> 32:56.180
I'm a no-good shit magnet.

32:56.181 --> 32:59.300
I'm... I'm nothing.

32:59.301 --> 33:03.300
So why do I see a...glorious fucking
head-fucked thing?

33:21.061 --> 33:24.060
Who are you?

33:24.061 --> 33:27.780
Don't...

33:27.781 --> 33:31.780
See you around. Remember to aim
straight for the heart next time.

33:46.861 --> 33:48.820
This is amazing!

33:48.821 --> 33:51.860
Is it like Wallace & Gromit?

33:51.861 --> 33:55.020
After the apocalypse.
How did you get in?

33:55.021 --> 33:58.820
Your dad let me. The old one.
He's lovely.

33:58.821 --> 34:02.820
So...you've come
to take the piss some more?

34:02.901 --> 34:04.540
No, Franky. I came to say sorry.

34:04.541 --> 34:08.540
Sorry?
For fucking my life up? Again?

34:08.940 --> 34:11.139
That wasn't me, it was Nick.

34:11.141 --> 34:14.659
Mini's boyfriend?

34:14.661 --> 34:17.260
Doing her dirty work.

34:17.261 --> 34:20.300
She's really sorry, Franky.

34:20.301 --> 34:22.620
Bollocks.

34:22.621 --> 34:24.540
She is.

34:24.541 --> 34:26.179
I know she is.

34:26.181 --> 34:30.179
Deep down. She just...
doesn't know it yet.

34:30.981 --> 34:34.980
We really like you, Franky.
Me, Liv and um...

34:36.701 --> 34:40.699
Have a great party.

34:43.061 --> 34:47.060
I'm sorry you won't
be going, Franky.

34:53.981 --> 34:57.980
Yeah. So am I.

35:11.421 --> 35:15.420

37:23.501 --> 37:24.980
Don't fuck, lads.

37:24.981 --> 37:28.980
All right! All right!

37:32.541 --> 37:35.140
Cor, you look sharp, Franks!

37:35.141 --> 37:36.420
I could go gay for you, I reck.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.420
She's a girl, you dick.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.460
Thank you.

37:40.461 --> 37:43.660
You all right, little 'un?

37:43.661 --> 37:46.020
Franky!

37:46.021 --> 37:50.020
Come on.
Fancy a spliff?

37:53.101 --> 37:54.020
Thanks.

37:54.021 --> 37:58.020
You'll look like a nun
at a brothel in there.

38:23.901 --> 38:27.900
Mini.

38:28.021 --> 38:30.780
Franky, what the hell are
you doing here?

38:30.781 --> 38:34.780
I came because you,
uh, you invited me.

38:35.461 --> 38:39.460
Well, now I'm uh-uh-un-inviting you,
Cinder-fella, so...leave.

38:40.741 --> 38:43.980
I don't want...to.

38:43.981 --> 38:46.340
No, I'm staying.

38:46.341 --> 38:49.820
I'm...I'm not going anywhere.

38:49.821 --> 38:52.420
F-R-E-A-K.
Now what does that spell?

38:52.421 --> 38:54.420
Let me see, oh, yeah, you.

38:54.421 --> 38:57.020
No wonder the girls at your old
school went ape shit on your arse.

38:57.021 --> 39:00.100
I mean, just, just look at you,
standing there like some...

39:00.101 --> 39:03.980
Cuntless dyke-alike
no-breed stutter-fucker spako

39:03.981 --> 39:07.780
lamo shit-headed wanker magnet
Oliver Twist-ed thimble-titted

39:07.781 --> 39:11.780
loser-loner fugly bastard?

39:16.981 --> 39:19.300
I think you're great.

39:19.301 --> 39:21.500
A billion miles better than this,

39:21.501 --> 39:25.500
this bollocks place.

39:25.861 --> 39:28.740
And I really feel...that,

39:28.741 --> 39:32.740
that we could be mates...
fucking awesome mates.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.980
They're not your mates.

39:35.981 --> 39:38.460
They're my mates.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.940
We only let you tag
along with us for jokes.

39:40.941 --> 39:43.180
That's not true.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.380
Is it, Grace? That's not true.

39:46.381 --> 39:47.860
Speak up, Gracey.

39:47.861 --> 39:51.020
Mini, please.

39:51.021 --> 39:55.020
We had laughs, Liv, didn't we?

39:56.541 --> 39:59.020
Must've been tripping, Frankenstein.

39:59.021 --> 40:03.020
Now get the fuck out of my party.

40:14.861 --> 40:18.660
That bad-mouthed lesbo's like
shit on my fucking stiletto.

40:18.911 --> 40:22.910
Seriously, Mins, this
isn't Year 11 any more.

40:27.311 --> 40:31.310
Where the fuck is Grace?

40:36.871 --> 40:40.270
I take it madam had
a delightful eventide.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.350
Shit.

40:41.351 --> 40:45.350
Franky! Come back!

41:02.871 --> 41:04.190
Oi!

41:04.191 --> 41:06.110
What the fuck?

41:06.111 --> 41:10.110
Get off me! Stop!
Agh, what are you doing?!

41:22.231 --> 41:24.270
Can you fucking put me down already?

41:24.271 --> 41:28.270
This isn't funny. Fucking hell,
Rich, I'm gonna be sick.

41:35.471 --> 41:39.470
Right. Are we ready, yeah?

41:50.591 --> 41:52.950
What the fuck?

41:52.951 --> 41:55.550
Welcome to Bristol, Franky.

41:55.551 --> 41:59.550
This is my favourite place.

42:05.031 --> 42:07.230
Cheers.

42:07.231 --> 42:11.230
You fuckers!

42:28.431 --> 42:31.430
Come on, come on!

42:31.431 --> 42:32.950
Come on, Franky, get in now!

42:35.511 --> 42:39.510
♪ BRITISH SEA POWER:
We're All Waving Flags

43:30.351 --> 43:34.350
..I'm freezing...

43:44.911 --> 43:46.870
What do you do for fun, Rich?

43:46.871 --> 43:50.430
Listen to music. Liaaarrrr.

43:50.431 --> 43:54.070
Go to gigs...

43:54.071 --> 43:56.510
Hang out with my mate.

43:56.511 --> 43:59.510
Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay!

43:59.511 --> 44:01.870
Hi...

44:01.871 --> 44:04.030
Um, er, um...your t-shirt...

44:04.031 --> 44:08.030
You need someone to
teach you the ways of the woman.
