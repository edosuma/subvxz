WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:01.562
Angie, all I'm
saying is that

00:01.597 --> 00:03.626
changing physical
therapists was a mistake.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.313
She says the hard work will pay off.
Yeah.

00:06.348 --> 00:08.068
(German accent):
The hard work will pay off.

00:08.298 --> 00:10.265
Nurse Ratched has been
torturing me every morning

00:10.300 --> 00:12.033
for the past month
and there's no change,

00:12.069 --> 00:14.235
which I'm totally fine with,
but I was also fine with

00:14.271 --> 00:15.336
our old physical
therapist.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.704
By "old physical therapist,"

00:16.740 --> 00:19.441
you mean the hot 26-year-old?

00:19.476 --> 00:22.043
Wait, was she hot?
I didn't notice.

00:22.079 --> 00:23.578
That's not why you were
always showing her

00:23.613 --> 00:25.080
how strong your core
was getting?

00:25.115 --> 00:27.816
Come on now,
she's a medical professional.

00:27.851 --> 00:30.385
I'm sure she viewed my body
in a purely clinical way.

00:30.420 --> 00:33.088
It's not how she viewed your
body I was talking about.

00:33.123 --> 00:34.889
(chuckles)

00:34.925 --> 00:36.357
(sniffs) Hey, you smell that?

00:36.393 --> 00:37.393
It smells like...

00:37.427 --> 00:38.927
A frat house.

00:38.962 --> 00:40.662
Someone throw a party in here
and not invite us?

00:40.697 --> 00:42.497
Wasn't quite a party;
it's a body.

00:42.532 --> 00:43.965
Did somebody
drink themselves to death?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.500
It's not how
they died,

00:45.535 --> 00:46.935
it's where they were found.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.036
HODGINS:
Where?

00:48.071 --> 00:49.370
Outside a bar?

00:49.406 --> 00:50.438
Close.

00:50.474 --> 00:52.807
Inside a glass recycling plant.

00:52.843 --> 00:54.776
MONTENEGRO:
(exhales) Ouch.

00:54.811 --> 00:56.544
SAROYAN: Yeah, there's a machine
that breaks up the glass

00:56.580 --> 00:58.179
and spits it into a
pile 20 feet below.

00:58.215 --> 01:00.181
So the victim was
a human pincushion.

01:00.217 --> 01:01.716
It's gonna be like
working on a cactus.

01:01.751 --> 01:02.717
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, so,

01:02.752 --> 01:04.319
how are the plans coming?

01:04.354 --> 01:06.254
Is Arastoo on board
with the big wedding?

01:06.289 --> 01:08.523
Arastoo's excited, actually.
We've been going...

01:08.558 --> 01:09.524
(glass clatters)

01:09.559 --> 01:10.692
Ooh, careful.

01:10.727 --> 01:11.793
That wasn't me.

01:11.828 --> 01:14.062
I think we just had a tremor.

01:14.097 --> 01:16.064
What, like an earthquake?
I didn't feel anything.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.133
Maybe it was a foreshock.

01:18.168 --> 01:19.234
No, I'm serious.

01:19.269 --> 01:21.102
El Niño has increased
the activity in the Virginia

01:21.138 --> 01:22.537
Seismic Zone.
Or...

01:22.572 --> 01:24.405
you knocked into the Dumpster.

01:24.441 --> 01:26.374
Wheelchair or not, I'm careful.

01:26.409 --> 01:28.042
Why is it 9:00 in the morning

01:28.078 --> 01:30.178
and all I can think about
is having a beer?

01:33.683 --> 01:35.483
A few beers last
night will not

01:35.519 --> 01:37.619
make your vision
blurry today.

01:37.654 --> 01:38.786
Oh, Bones, I'm fine.

01:38.822 --> 01:39.988
Okay, Mr. Fine.

01:40.023 --> 01:41.289
Read that street sign.

01:41.324 --> 01:44.292
That sign says, uh...
uh, Michigan Avenue.

01:44.327 --> 01:45.593
Missouri Avenue.

01:45.629 --> 01:47.228
Oh, well, it's a state.

01:47.264 --> 01:49.764
You have to call the eye doctor
when you get to the office.

01:49.799 --> 01:51.199
All he's gonna tell me is,
"You know what,

01:51.234 --> 01:52.700
"you had a few drinks.
Eat a raw egg and,

01:52.736 --> 01:54.269
you know what, you're gonna
be fine in a few hours."

01:54.304 --> 01:57.238
Alcohol consumption
gives you slower pupil reaction.

01:57.274 --> 01:59.741
It does not cause
blurriness.

01:59.776 --> 02:03.444
And the dehydration would
make your eyes dry, not puffy.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.412
I'm not puffy.

02:04.447 --> 02:05.747
A little puffy.

02:05.782 --> 02:06.748
I'm not puffy; I'm fine.

02:06.783 --> 02:08.082
Okay, listen, I mean,

02:08.118 --> 02:10.018
I've had 20/10 vision
my whole life.

02:10.053 --> 02:11.553
It's what makes me
an expert marksman.

02:11.588 --> 02:13.221
I hate to
tell you this,

02:13.256 --> 02:15.657
Booth, but you're not 22 anymore.
You know what,

02:15.692 --> 02:17.625
I'm gonna prove it to you.
Pull over and let me drive.

02:17.661 --> 02:19.260
Great, excellent idea.

02:19.296 --> 02:22.096
Let's risk the lives of
both of our children's parents

02:22.132 --> 02:25.400
so you can feel manly
and virile and young.

02:25.435 --> 02:27.468
I am manly, virile and young.

02:27.504 --> 02:29.470
And I'm driving.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.708
BRENNAN: Oh, I see you
decided to begin without me.

02:33.743 --> 02:35.877
Well, I suggested we clear out
the glass in order

02:35.912 --> 02:37.178
to preserve your fingers.

02:37.214 --> 02:39.614
It's not necessary
to protect me.

02:39.649 --> 02:42.517
However, we might
as well begin.

02:42.552 --> 02:46.087
Femoral head diameter
suggests what, Ms. Wick?

02:46.122 --> 02:47.655
That our victim is female.

02:47.691 --> 02:50.391
From intercondylar
notch height, I'd say

02:50.427 --> 02:52.427
she was of
European descent.

02:52.462 --> 02:53.928
And there's marbling
on the abdomen,

02:53.964 --> 02:57.031
rigor has passed,
lividity fixed.

02:57.067 --> 03:00.068
I'd say time of death
was roughly 36 hours ago.

03:00.103 --> 03:01.636
BRENNAN: Well, the
mandible's intact.

03:01.671 --> 03:04.105
We should be able to match it
to dental records.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.608
Wear on the
mandibular teeth

03:06.643 --> 03:09.310
suggests she was
in her mid-30s...

03:09.346 --> 03:10.778
That's odd.

03:10.814 --> 03:12.513
Her mouth was closed,

03:12.549 --> 03:14.682
but there appears to
be a shard of glass

03:14.718 --> 03:17.719
embedded just below
the mandibular foramen.

03:17.754 --> 03:19.420
DAISY: So it's perimortem.
Maybe she was

03:19.456 --> 03:20.989
killed in the recycling plant.

03:25.595 --> 03:27.228
I'd say this isn't glass.

03:27.264 --> 03:30.164
I'd say it's a very large,
very expensive diamond.

03:32.936 --> 03:35.303
Wow, two carats.

03:35.338 --> 03:38.640
Based on color, cut and clarity,
I'm guessing that

03:38.675 --> 03:41.175
this is worth
at least 30 grand.

03:41.211 --> 03:43.911
It's pretty, but I don't know
that much about diamonds.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.280
Lance gave me his mother's ring,

03:45.315 --> 03:47.782
so we never
had to pick anything out.

03:47.817 --> 03:50.385
I want to show you this.

03:54.858 --> 03:56.891
You can put a serial
number on a diamond?

03:56.926 --> 03:59.627
(laughs): Yeah, and when
it's this big, you better.

03:59.663 --> 04:01.629
So this means that we can
find out who bought this.

04:01.665 --> 04:03.931
I mean, maybe the victim,
maybe the killer.

04:03.967 --> 04:06.100
I'll let Booth know.

04:07.604 --> 04:09.904
(metal clatters)

04:10.940 --> 04:11.739
Are you okay?

04:11.775 --> 04:12.775
Huh?

04:12.809 --> 04:14.342
Yeah, no, no, I'm fine.

04:14.377 --> 04:16.878
Wow, I'm beginning to think
there's some strong

04:16.913 --> 04:18.980
activity on the fault lines
underneath the Jeffersonian.

04:19.015 --> 04:20.615
You think that was
an earthquake?

04:20.649 --> 04:22.116
I was right outside.

04:22.152 --> 04:24.719
I didn't feel anything,
and nothing else moved.

04:24.754 --> 04:26.120
Yeah, I'm telling you,

04:26.156 --> 04:27.722
this-this happened earlier also.

04:27.757 --> 04:29.223
It-it shook the Dumpster.

04:29.259 --> 04:31.926
Hmm. Interesting.

04:31.961 --> 04:33.895
Interesting how?
Well, I'm not one to go in

04:33.930 --> 04:36.564
for the unusual, but I've
learned to open my mind.

04:36.599 --> 04:38.199
Have you considered
that you may

04:38.234 --> 04:40.435
have yourself a poltergeist?
Daisy,

04:40.470 --> 04:42.236
I am not being
haunted by a ghost.

04:42.272 --> 04:43.304
I didn't say

04:43.340 --> 04:44.706
you were being haunted.

04:44.741 --> 04:47.241
I just implied that
you may be the magnet.

04:47.277 --> 04:49.577
Spirits tend to focus
on one individual.

04:49.612 --> 04:51.179
Usually, they're trying
to send a message.

04:51.214 --> 04:52.214
A message like what?

04:52.248 --> 04:53.514
I need to empty my trash?

04:53.550 --> 04:55.383
I would have thought that
someone who's convinced

04:55.418 --> 04:57.218
that alien beings
built Stonehenge

04:57.253 --> 04:59.420
would be more open
to the paranormal.

04:59.456 --> 05:01.889
Daisy, I'm open as long as
it has scientific basis.

05:01.925 --> 05:03.324
(chuckles):
I mean, come on!

05:03.360 --> 05:04.959
Ghosts do not.

05:04.994 --> 05:08.029
Well, you can ignore the
message; it's your prerogative.

05:08.064 --> 05:12.266
But I'm just warning you, you
may have company for a while.

05:12.302 --> 05:14.435
They like to be heard.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074

MAN: At the Gemological Society,
we're dedicated

06:01.837 --> 06:03.703
to both research
and education

06:03.705 --> 06:05.905
in the field of gemology
and the jewelry arts.

06:05.940 --> 06:08.274
You also help track
diamonds, correct?

06:08.309 --> 06:10.789
Yes, we're able to etch
microscopic markings

06:10.796 --> 06:13.163
that provides a degree
of security our clients require.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.966
Now, what about the
diamond that we found?

06:15.001 --> 06:16.367
Who does that belong to?

06:16.403 --> 06:17.502
I remember that particular
diamond quite well;

06:17.537 --> 06:18.670
I marked it myself.

06:18.705 --> 06:21.506
It's part of this.

06:21.541 --> 06:23.374
It's the Topkapi Dagger.

06:23.410 --> 06:25.243
Or rather, it's a replica
of the original,

06:25.278 --> 06:28.680
a gift from the Sultan Mehmed I
to the Iranian conqueror

06:28.715 --> 06:30.381
Nadir Shah in the 1700s.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.984
Wait, you-you mean like
the heist movie <i>Topkapi?</i>

06:33.019 --> 06:33.952
Indeed.

06:33.987 --> 06:35.186
The film's notoriety

06:35.222 --> 06:36.821
made the dagger
even more valuable.

06:36.857 --> 06:38.056
This copy?

06:38.091 --> 06:39.457
Worth half a million itself.

06:39.493 --> 06:40.725
(whistles)

06:40.760 --> 06:42.794
The stone you found
is from the sheath.

06:42.829 --> 06:44.929
Roughly here.

06:44.965 --> 06:47.165
So who pays a half a million
dollars for a fake dagger?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.333
The rich today
are no different

06:48.368 --> 06:50.201
from the kings and queens
of old.

06:50.237 --> 06:52.570
They like expensive, pretty
things no one else can have.

06:52.606 --> 06:55.039
No, what-what I meant was,
specifically,

06:55.075 --> 06:56.474
who does that dagger belong to?

06:56.510 --> 06:57.909
Ah, well,
that's another twist.

06:57.944 --> 06:59.244
It was on loan

06:59.279 --> 07:02.013
to a jewelry store for a display
of "Crown Jewels of the World,"

07:02.048 --> 07:04.082
but jewel thieves stole it
three days ago,

07:04.117 --> 07:05.517
the day it arrived.

07:05.552 --> 07:06.985
Oh, that's awesome.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.753
I mean, it's
not awesome

07:08.788 --> 07:10.455
that it was stolen.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.490
Look, the truth is,
I've always wanted

07:12.526 --> 07:15.994
to play cat and mouse
with a jewel thief.

07:16.029 --> 07:17.862
<i>You know what the nuns</i>
<i>in Catholic school</i>

07:17.898 --> 07:19.230
<i>say causes blindness?</i>

07:19.266 --> 07:20.999
That's funny.

07:21.034 --> 07:23.902
That's... (mutters)

07:23.937 --> 07:25.904
You're beginning to
look like a squint.

07:25.939 --> 07:27.505
Are you sure you're okay?

07:27.541 --> 07:28.873
I'm fine.
Okay, looks like the thieves

07:28.909 --> 07:31.576
were in and out
in under two minutes.

07:31.611 --> 07:33.144
Okay. Total haul?

07:33.180 --> 07:36.581
Um, 3.2...

07:36.616 --> 07:39.617
or it's 3.3...

07:39.653 --> 07:42.453
Wait. Wait a second.

07:42.489 --> 07:43.955
5.3? I'm not sure.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.323
Great, Booth.

07:45.358 --> 07:46.558
That's really useful.
You know what,

07:46.593 --> 07:47.926
I'll just read
the file myself

07:47.961 --> 07:50.361
when we leave the
jewelry store. So...

07:50.397 --> 07:51.785
what's your favorite
jewel heist movie?

07:51.786 --> 07:52.495
<i>Thief.</i>

07:52.499 --> 07:54.766
Jimmy Caan.
Now that's a movie star.

07:54.801 --> 07:56.901
Okay, all right,
not bad, not bad.

07:56.937 --> 07:58.937
Me? <i>Rififi.</i>

07:58.972 --> 08:00.071
What the hell is <i>Rififi?</i>

08:00.106 --> 08:01.439
Oh, come on,
it's a classic.

08:01.474 --> 08:04.509
Half hour heist
sequence, no dialogue.

08:04.544 --> 08:06.411
I'm falling asleep already.
What?!

08:06.446 --> 08:07.879
No, you should see it.
It's great.

08:07.914 --> 08:09.881
Half the reason I do what I do
is 'cause of movies like that.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.783
I thought you did this
because of your dad.

08:11.818 --> 08:13.051
Yeah, sure, but I mean,
after all that,

08:13.086 --> 08:15.553
that was part of my escape,
you know, into old movies.

08:15.589 --> 08:17.755
Most people, they watch those
movies, they want the thieves

08:17.791 --> 08:19.157
to get away
with the heist.

08:19.192 --> 08:20.491
Me, I always,

08:20.527 --> 08:21.826
always rooted for the cop.

08:21.861 --> 08:23.828
You know, or whoever
was trying to stop them.

08:23.863 --> 08:25.830
You're like a kid
in a candy store with this.

08:25.865 --> 08:27.665
Just remember, we're trying
to catch a killer here.

08:27.701 --> 08:29.901
Well, hey, you think of it
as going after a killer;

08:29.936 --> 08:33.071
me, I'm playing
<i>To Catch A Thief.</i>

08:33.106 --> 08:34.772
That's a movie.

08:34.808 --> 08:36.741
Cary Grant.
Yeah, I know that one.

08:36.775 --> 08:39.777
And I hate to tell you, but
you're nothing like Cary Grant.

08:39.813 --> 08:41.578
Why would you say that?

08:41.615 --> 08:43.648
Well, the truth is,
they were perfect gentlemen.

08:43.683 --> 08:45.083
Perfect gentlemen, right,

08:45.118 --> 08:47.185
wearing ski masks,
and that didn't strike you

08:47.220 --> 08:48.920
as odd when
you buzzed them in?

08:48.955 --> 08:50.321
Well, I-I wasn't
buzzing them in.

08:50.357 --> 08:52.590
There was an older man,
moved quite slowly.

08:52.626 --> 08:55.360
When I released the lock,
the thieves came

08:55.395 --> 08:56.294
out of nowhere.

08:56.329 --> 08:58.062
You think the old man
was in on it?

08:58.098 --> 08:59.098
No, no, he's a regular.

08:59.132 --> 09:01.165
I think they just waited
for the right moment.

09:01.201 --> 09:02.567
What else can
you tell us

09:02.602 --> 09:03.835
about these, uh,
"perfect gentlemen"?

09:03.870 --> 09:04.870
The bigger guy,

09:04.904 --> 09:07.138
he spoke with some kind of
European accent.

09:07.173 --> 09:08.640
Maybe Spanish?

09:08.675 --> 09:10.875
The other one
never said a word.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.377
Went right for the crown jewels,

09:12.412 --> 09:15.046
smashed the display case
with some kind of hammer,

09:15.081 --> 09:17.649
then they thanked us
for our patience.

09:17.684 --> 09:19.450
They really were quite nice.

09:19.486 --> 09:20.652
Okay, thanks so much.

09:20.687 --> 09:21.919
Appreciate it.

09:21.955 --> 09:23.554
You ask me,
they sound like pros here.

09:23.590 --> 09:24.922
They've done this before.
Yup.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.190
Let's check the M.O.,

09:26.226 --> 09:27.725
see where else these
"gentlemen" have hit.

09:27.761 --> 09:28.660
Right.

09:28.695 --> 09:29.961
I hear that, Cary Grant.

09:29.996 --> 09:32.230
Shall we, Cary?
Mr. Grant?

09:37.003 --> 09:39.737
I know why Angela
couldn't get an I.D.

09:39.773 --> 09:41.973
Because our victim
is not American.

09:42.008 --> 09:44.175
What? You ran an isotopic analysis?
I did, yes.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.312
And I found levels of
oxygen 13 and nitrogen 15,

09:47.347 --> 09:50.381
which are consistent with women
raised near the Loire River.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.884
Oh, I'm familiar
with the Loire Valley.

09:52.919 --> 09:54.385
It's known
as the "Cradle of France."

09:54.421 --> 09:57.388
Wine and produce
grow abundantly there.

09:57.424 --> 09:59.123
(French accent): It's also
where the French nobility

09:59.159 --> 10:00.758
have gone for
centuries to escape

10:00.794 --> 10:03.294
the "little people"
of Paris.

10:03.330 --> 10:04.696
SAROYAN: Uh, Dr. Brennan,
Dr. Hodgins,

10:04.731 --> 10:07.398
this is Inspector Rousseau.
Bonjour.

10:07.434 --> 10:08.366
Bonjour.

10:08.401 --> 10:10.034
Bonjour.
SAROYAN: He's here from Paris,

10:10.070 --> 10:11.302
and he believes he has

10:11.338 --> 10:12.370
information
relevant to our case.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.038
I do not believe
it to be so,

10:14.074 --> 10:15.273
I know it to be so.

10:15.308 --> 10:16.808
BRENNAN: Well,
all due respect, Inspector,

10:16.843 --> 10:18.242
but I don't know
how you can have

10:18.278 --> 10:20.445
information on a murder
when we do not know

10:20.480 --> 10:23.581
who our murder victim is
or how or where she was killed.

10:23.616 --> 10:25.983
Yeah, you are correct.

10:26.019 --> 10:27.985
I do not know how or
where she was killed,

10:28.021 --> 10:29.954
but I know who she is
and who killed her.

10:29.989 --> 10:31.155
I've been pursuing
this jewel thief

10:31.191 --> 10:32.824
across France
for the past six months.

10:32.859 --> 10:34.892
Now, five days ago,
my suspect boarded

10:34.928 --> 10:36.561
a plane from
Charles De Gaulle Airport

10:36.596 --> 10:37.762
to Washington, D.C.

10:37.797 --> 10:40.832
Now, I believe your heist
is identical to all of mine.

10:40.867 --> 10:45.536
Your victim's name,
or her title, rather,

10:45.572 --> 10:48.373
is the Marquise
De Chaussin.

10:48.408 --> 10:50.908
And I will stake my reputation
on the fact that her killer

10:50.944 --> 10:52.877
is her husband,
the Marquis De Chaussin.

10:52.912 --> 10:54.946
And I'm going to prove
that he's behind

10:54.981 --> 10:58.583
the jewel heists,
and that he murdered his wife.

11:06.126 --> 11:07.559
Look, I'm just saying,
how cool is this?

11:07.594 --> 11:10.795
I mean, how often do we get
a chance to go after royalty?

11:10.797 --> 11:12.096
Well, I'm not calling him
Your Highness,

11:12.131 --> 11:13.931
I'll tell you that.
ROUSSEAU: And nor should you.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.866
You see, the concept
of nobility in France

11:15.902 --> 11:17.168
was deemed legally incompatible

11:17.203 --> 11:19.337
with the equality
of its citizens

11:19.372 --> 11:20.404
in 1789.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.039
You must be
Inspector Rousseau.

11:22.075 --> 11:23.374
Indeed.

11:23.409 --> 11:24.408
I'm gonna tell you
what my wife told you.

11:24.444 --> 11:26.344
Your badge
means nothing over here.

11:26.379 --> 11:28.312
It's squat, pal, okay?
We can handle this.

11:28.348 --> 11:29.680
Okay, I'm
well aware of

11:29.716 --> 11:30.948
your American "can do" attitude,

11:30.984 --> 11:32.650
but let's put aside our egos,
huh?

11:32.685 --> 11:34.118
Call my superior,

11:34.153 --> 11:36.087
and he'll explain to you
what I can do for you.

11:36.122 --> 11:37.388
(chuckles)
I'm-I'm sorry, Inspector.

11:37.423 --> 11:40.224
Y-You've got your French
protocol, we've got ours.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.126
Okay, okay. Very well, then.

11:42.161 --> 11:43.861
You can at least take this.

11:43.896 --> 11:45.830
What's this?
It's a dossier you don't get.

11:45.865 --> 11:46.931
A file.

11:46.966 --> 11:48.299
See, the Marquis
was present

11:48.334 --> 11:50.601
at every location
of every heist.

11:50.637 --> 11:53.037
And his wife
wasn't his first victim.

11:53.072 --> 11:54.605
<i>Monsieur,</i>

11:54.641 --> 11:56.474
<i>merci beaucoup.</i>

11:56.509 --> 11:59.644
They say the French
are arrogant.

12:01.581 --> 12:02.747
Anything good?

12:02.782 --> 12:04.015
What? You think
I speak French?

12:04.050 --> 12:05.783
Here, it's all yours.
(sighs)

12:05.818 --> 12:07.818
Okay.
Here's what's gonna happen.

12:07.854 --> 12:10.021
(clears throat)
I'm gonna go read this file,

12:10.056 --> 12:11.489
because it's in English.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.164
And then I'm gonna go
talk to the Marquis.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.592
You are gonna go back in there,
you're gonna make

12:14.627 --> 12:16.427
an appointment for your eyes.
Look, I'm-I'm fine.

12:16.462 --> 12:18.462
It's nothing. My eyes are fine.
Booth, it's not a crime

12:18.498 --> 12:20.898
to need glasses.
Okay, look, I will go

12:20.933 --> 12:22.667
and get my eyes checked.

12:22.702 --> 12:24.669
Okay? But not a word of this
to Bones. I really don't need

12:24.704 --> 12:26.804
to hear her say,
"I told you so."

12:26.839 --> 12:28.873
Only reason I'm doing this
is so I can tell her,

12:28.908 --> 12:30.875
and you, "I told you so."

12:35.448 --> 12:37.882
I think I found
cause of death.

12:37.917 --> 12:39.884
Once we got all the glass
out of the remaining tissue,

12:39.919 --> 12:42.119
I was able to see that
the larynx had been crushed.

12:42.155 --> 12:43.120
Interesting.

12:43.156 --> 12:45.923
Let's take a look here.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.492
You are correct.

12:48.528 --> 12:51.529
The hyoid has a midline
fracture as well,

12:51.564 --> 12:52.596
which leads me
to believe

12:52.632 --> 12:54.565
the victim was
strangled from behind,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.068
perhaps with some
sort of cord.

12:57.103 --> 12:59.704
I had Hodgins swab
the neck wound for particulates.

12:59.739 --> 13:01.472
HODGINS: Well, I can do
better than particulates.

13:01.507 --> 13:04.208
So, in the wound
around the larynx,

13:04.243 --> 13:06.944
I found a tiny piece
of silk thread, which was

13:06.979 --> 13:10.648
dyed with this insect-based dye
and woven with gold.

13:10.683 --> 13:11.816
From a tapestry.

13:11.851 --> 13:13.084
Yeah.
Wow, that's really good.

13:13.119 --> 13:15.753
A 17th century
French tapestry,

13:15.788 --> 13:18.189
which was woven
at the court of Louis XIV.

13:18.224 --> 13:21.225
Rousseau said the Marquis
is a direct descendant

13:21.260 --> 13:23.527
of Louis XIV.
<i>Ah, oui.</i>

13:23.563 --> 13:26.297
(bad French accent):
Once again, Inspector Clouseau

13:26.332 --> 13:28.132
is on the trail
of the Pink Panther,

13:28.167 --> 13:29.300
and this time,

13:29.335 --> 13:31.602
we can help.

13:31.637 --> 13:34.105
Why are you talking in
that ridiculous accent?

13:34.140 --> 13:35.660
(normal voice):
I'm-I'm doing Clouseau.

13:36.442 --> 13:38.042
From the <i>Pink Panther</i> movies.

13:38.077 --> 13:39.310
Peter Sellers.

13:39.345 --> 13:40.678
Or Steve Martin.

13:40.713 --> 13:43.114
Both comic geniuses
in their own right.

13:43.149 --> 13:44.582
Well, I'm not familiar
with them,

13:44.617 --> 13:46.650
though I am quite sure
panthers are never pink.

13:46.686 --> 13:48.319
No, no, no.

13:48.354 --> 13:49.453
D-Don't bother.

13:49.489 --> 13:51.422
She's a lost cause.

13:51.457 --> 13:52.623
In terms of movies, I mean.

13:52.658 --> 13:53.624
Seriously.

13:53.659 --> 13:55.326
Well, in any event,
this is excellent work.

13:55.361 --> 13:58.963
And if a French tapestry
is our murder weapon,

13:58.998 --> 14:01.766
I can venture a guess
where we might find it.

14:04.003 --> 14:07.905
BRENNAN: <i>So Booth is in a</i>
<i>meeting at the French Embassy?</i>

14:07.940 --> 14:10.541
Yeah. We, uh,
split up the tasks.

14:10.576 --> 14:12.877
He's at the eye doctor,
isn't he?

14:12.912 --> 14:14.568
Damn it.
How do you do that?

14:14.592 --> 14:15.480
I know my husband.

14:15.481 --> 14:16.981
Well, don't tell Booth
that I broke, okay?

14:17.016 --> 14:18.182
I'll never hear
the end of it.

14:18.217 --> 14:21.152
I don't need to hear him
tell me that I was right.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.387
It's enough to know
that he knows I was right.

14:24.290 --> 14:28.225
So... it seems
the De Chaussin family fortune

14:28.261 --> 14:31.228
dates back to the 16th century,

14:31.264 --> 14:33.397
but in the past five years,
bad investments

14:33.432 --> 14:34.965
have cost them
almost all of it.

14:35.001 --> 14:37.201
But the Marquis--
he has not missed a beat.

14:37.236 --> 14:42.039
Balls, charities,
vacations in Monte Carlo.

14:42.074 --> 14:44.074
Well, Inspector Rousseau
believes that stolen jewels

14:44.110 --> 14:46.544
are financing it all.

14:46.579 --> 14:50.447
<i>From the looks of this place,</i>
<i>he may be right.</i>

14:50.483 --> 14:53.184
(whistles)
Something's paying for all this.

14:53.219 --> 14:55.319
(quiet chatter)

14:58.257 --> 15:00.925
Not exactly the picture of a man
worried about his missing wife.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.226
BRENNAN:
No.

15:02.261 --> 15:03.561
AUBREY:
Sir.

15:03.596 --> 15:05.296
Special Agent Aubrey
with the FBI.

15:05.331 --> 15:07.198
Well, let me guess.

15:07.233 --> 15:10.234
That pathetic French inspector
with his crass manners

15:10.269 --> 15:13.237
has carried his witch hunt
across the Atlantic.

15:13.272 --> 15:15.539
Well, if you want
to see my wife

15:15.575 --> 15:18.809
and continue this charade,
save your breath.

15:18.845 --> 15:20.711
We have grown tired
of this game.

15:20.746 --> 15:22.079
She won't see you.

15:22.114 --> 15:23.714
We're not here to see your wife.

15:23.749 --> 15:25.449
We're here about your wife.

15:25.484 --> 15:27.017
She's been murdered.

15:30.690 --> 15:31.755
AUBREY:
All broken up,

15:31.791 --> 15:33.357
I see.

15:33.392 --> 15:34.625
Henri, is there anything
I can get you?

15:34.660 --> 15:36.160
No. No, no, I'm...
(clears throat)

15:36.195 --> 15:38.395
How did this happen?

15:38.431 --> 15:40.397
Well, we're trying
to figure that out.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.832
We know it was
two days ago.

15:41.868 --> 15:43.534
Now, y-you didn't know
that your wife was missing?

15:43.569 --> 15:44.702
She said she was

15:44.737 --> 15:46.170
going to New York to shop,

15:46.205 --> 15:47.938
whilst I conducted
some family business.

15:47.974 --> 15:49.640
Mind telling us
what that business is?

15:49.675 --> 15:50.708
Yes.

15:50.743 --> 15:51.942
It's none of your concern.

15:53.679 --> 15:55.479
Henri, perhaps we should
discuss this inside.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.481
I'm sorry, uh, wh-who are you?
Blake.

15:57.516 --> 15:59.483
Blake Masters.
She's a graduate student

15:59.518 --> 16:01.018
from the University of Virginia.

16:01.053 --> 16:03.120
She's been managing
this small holding for me.

16:03.155 --> 16:05.656
Small holding. Right.

16:05.691 --> 16:07.024
BRENNAN:
Well, in any event,

16:07.059 --> 16:08.492
I believe Ms. Masters
is correct.

16:08.527 --> 16:09.793
We should go inside.

16:09.829 --> 16:10.995
Absolutely not.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.963
I know this game you play.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.265
I will not invite you in

16:14.300 --> 16:16.533
to amass some bogus evidence
against me.

16:16.569 --> 16:19.003
Look, I'll just come back later
with a warrant.

16:19.038 --> 16:20.671
Well, you may attempt
to do so,

16:20.706 --> 16:23.607
but as you venture down
that futile path,

16:23.643 --> 16:24.909
a word to the wise:

16:24.944 --> 16:27.645
Rousseau's ridiculous manhunt
cost him his job in France.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.581
I can only hope...

16:30.616 --> 16:32.783
you will not meet
the same fate.

16:37.890 --> 16:41.025
ROUSSEAU:
<i>Thank you, uh, for meeting me.</i>

16:41.060 --> 16:44.061
So, what's good here, huh?

16:44.096 --> 16:46.630
I think I would like, uh,
how do you say, uh,

16:46.666 --> 16:48.299
I would like to buy...

16:48.334 --> 16:50.768
(imitates Clouseau):
a 'amburger.

16:50.803 --> 16:53.337
(imitates Clouseau):
Ze dam-burg-ers are magnifique.

16:53.372 --> 16:54.372
(laughing)

16:54.407 --> 16:56.206
Hey, and they
say the French

16:56.242 --> 16:58.509
don't have a sense of humor
about themselves.

16:58.544 --> 17:00.811
When you're Inspector Rousseau
of the Police Nationale,

17:00.846 --> 17:03.480
you better learn to have
a sense of humor, you know?

17:03.516 --> 17:06.016
And to use it to ingratiate
yourself to get information.

17:06.051 --> 17:07.318
Very smart.

17:07.353 --> 17:09.185
But of course.

17:09.221 --> 17:10.954
I did my homework, Dr. Hodgins.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.388
I know you would have looked

17:12.425 --> 17:14.358
into the evidence
and understood

17:14.393 --> 17:16.660
that government forces
are thwarting my investigation.

17:16.695 --> 17:18.095
I did look into
the evidence.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.496
I also read everything I could

17:19.531 --> 17:21.131
about the body you found
in France,

17:21.166 --> 17:23.800
the "scout" from
the last heist,

17:23.836 --> 17:25.002
but nothing gave me
cause of death.

17:25.037 --> 17:26.569
Well, that's because
we could not determine it.

17:26.605 --> 17:29.239
The body was dumped
in the waters off Saint-Tropez.

17:29.275 --> 17:31.041
It wasn't found
until weeks later.

17:31.077 --> 17:33.010
Yes, but for Dr. Brennan,

17:33.045 --> 17:35.946
I mean, that's-that's
child's play.

17:35.982 --> 17:39.083
Hey, what if you got us
access to that body?

17:39.118 --> 17:41.785
Wait, so you're saying
you need my help, after all?

17:41.821 --> 17:43.821
We're after the same
thing, Inspector.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.723
The Marquis.

17:45.758 --> 17:48.525
(speaks French)

17:48.561 --> 17:50.394
Okay.

17:50.429 --> 17:52.029
I will arrange that.

17:52.064 --> 17:53.964
But in the meantime...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.033
Mademoiselle,
uh, deux 'amburger,

17:56.068 --> 17:57.368
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

17:57.403 --> 17:59.436
With French fries, please.

17:59.472 --> 18:00.604
(chuckles)

18:00.639 --> 18:02.239
You said you found something?

18:02.274 --> 18:04.208
Yeah, the car you saw
at the Marquis' estate,

18:04.243 --> 18:05.943
you were right.

18:05.978 --> 18:08.879
You drive that baby around,
people are gonna post photos.

18:08.914 --> 18:10.781
Well, I found
six posted on the day

18:10.816 --> 18:12.316
the Marquis'
wife was killed,

18:12.351 --> 18:14.518
but it's this last one
that you have to see.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.588
This was posted maybe
two hours before she died.

18:17.623 --> 18:19.390
Does the cafe mean something?

18:19.425 --> 18:22.092
Well, it's not where she is,
but it's who she's with.

18:22.128 --> 18:24.094
Well, well,

18:24.130 --> 18:26.196
Inspector.
Yeah, looks like

18:26.232 --> 18:27.831
our French expert
might have been

18:27.867 --> 18:29.900
the last one to
see her alive.

18:29.935 --> 18:33.470
Maybe that's because
he's the one who killed her.

18:37.390 --> 18:39.223
Well, finally.

18:39.259 --> 18:41.125
Did you call my superior?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.194
Well, I called the number
you gave me.

18:43.229 --> 18:44.562
That guy did
a sell job on you.

18:44.598 --> 18:45.863
Then I called
the main number.

18:45.899 --> 18:47.832
Turns out your ex-boss
wasn't a guy.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.634
She's a woman who fired you.

18:49.669 --> 18:51.903
Well, it worked in
<i>Beverly Hills Cop 2.</i>

18:51.938 --> 18:53.605
You can make
all the jokes you want,

18:53.640 --> 18:56.374
but I think that this vendetta
against the Marquis is a cover.

18:56.409 --> 18:59.010
You're the thief,
and you're setting him up.

18:59.045 --> 19:00.345
No, no, no, no, no,
Agent Aubrey.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.380
You do not think anything
so ridiculously incorrect.

19:02.415 --> 19:04.415
No, no, no, no, no, yourself.

19:04.451 --> 19:06.184
What's ridiculous
is that you forgot to mention

19:06.219 --> 19:09.921
that you were with the victim
hours before she died.

19:11.658 --> 19:13.224
Okay.

19:13.259 --> 19:15.026
I was working her for months.

19:15.061 --> 19:17.295
I tried to convince her
what her husband is.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.930
She thought it was
a joke, you know,

19:18.965 --> 19:20.932
a gentleman's game,
if you will.

19:20.967 --> 19:22.867
But when I found that body,

19:22.902 --> 19:24.802
I came to tell her,
and she was horrified.

19:24.838 --> 19:25.937
So you flew

19:25.972 --> 19:28.673
halfway around the world
to tell her your suspicions.

19:28.708 --> 19:30.742
I knew that she could not
look me in the eye

19:30.777 --> 19:32.443
and not know that I was
speaking the truth.

19:32.479 --> 19:34.078
All right, let's pretend
you are telling the truth.

19:34.114 --> 19:35.580
All right, you dropped
this bombshell on her,

19:35.615 --> 19:36.581
she confronts her husband,

19:36.616 --> 19:37.715
he kills her.

19:37.751 --> 19:39.617
Either way, there's still
blood on your hands.

19:39.653 --> 19:40.985
Don't you think
I realize that?

19:41.021 --> 19:44.522
This man has money and power.

19:44.557 --> 19:47.992
And in my experience,
people with money and power

19:48.028 --> 19:50.495
will do anything to keep it.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.564
Why would I trust you? Hmm?

19:53.600 --> 19:54.832
Your boss didn't.

19:54.868 --> 19:56.601
Haven't you ever had
a case where someone

19:56.636 --> 19:59.737
powerful tried to stop you,
and you did exactly like I have?

19:59.773 --> 20:01.105
Went wherever you needed to,

20:01.141 --> 20:02.440
lied if you had to,

20:02.475 --> 20:04.475
in order to bring
the killer to justice.

20:04.511 --> 20:06.644
Huh?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.913
Because if that's not the case,

20:08.948 --> 20:11.315
you are not half
the investigator

20:11.351 --> 20:13.785
I think you are, Agent Aubrey.

20:16.156 --> 20:18.489
AUBREY:
Okay.

20:18.525 --> 20:20.858
So did you break
that pompous French...

20:21.895 --> 20:23.361
(clears throat)
...detective?

20:23.396 --> 20:26.764
Nope. The pompous French
detective is, uh, right here.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.633
AUBREY: Look, I think he's
on the up-and-up, Booth.

20:28.668 --> 20:30.468
I mean, he's seen the videos
of the French heist.

20:30.503 --> 20:31.139
He can help us.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.005
Look, if the Marquis
is behind the heist,

20:33.006 --> 20:35.573
could the second thief
have been a woman?

20:35.608 --> 20:37.008
Okay, her name is Blake Masters.

20:37.043 --> 20:40.011
She's a 24-year-old
grad student

20:40.046 --> 20:41.779
from the, uh,
University of Virginia.

20:41.815 --> 20:43.848
And yet, I've seen her
in Paris for months.

20:43.883 --> 20:45.950
I mean, the story is she's
"interning" with the Marquis.

20:45.985 --> 20:47.819
Yeah? Is that what
they call it these days?

20:47.854 --> 20:50.121
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying
that she was not only in D.C.

20:50.156 --> 20:52.356
for this heist, but she was
in France for the other one?

20:52.392 --> 20:53.291
Let's take a look.

20:53.326 --> 20:55.526
Did you get
the surveillance videos?

20:55.562 --> 20:57.428
Uh, just...

20:57.464 --> 20:59.530
yeah, I got it.

20:59.566 --> 21:01.499
(clears throat)

21:03.636 --> 21:05.670
Whoa. Those are...

21:05.705 --> 21:06.871
Temporary.

21:06.906 --> 21:07.872
Temporary.

21:07.907 --> 21:08.907
Probably.

21:08.942 --> 21:10.007
Probably temporary.

21:10.043 --> 21:11.576
Take a look.
Got it.

21:12.645 --> 21:14.712
It's hard to say.
Could be.

21:14.748 --> 21:16.080
<i>Oui, c'est possible, non?</i>

21:16.116 --> 21:17.482
AUBREY: Well, looks
like I need to go

21:17.517 --> 21:19.183
have a conversation with our
innocent little grad student.

21:19.219 --> 21:20.651
If I may,
these kind of gems,

21:20.687 --> 21:22.153
they are really difficult
to move.

21:22.188 --> 21:23.721
We need to get inside
the Marquis' estate.

21:23.757 --> 21:25.323
No, no, no, just stop, okay?

21:25.358 --> 21:27.125
<i>We</i> need to get into the estate.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.026
The Marquis blocked our warrant.
I told you,

21:29.062 --> 21:30.895
I mean, these people have
had centuries to perfect

21:30.930 --> 21:32.764
working the system.
AUBREY: Hodgins told me

21:32.799 --> 21:34.966
that you're getting us access
to the French murder victim.

21:35.001 --> 21:37.168
Maybe Dr. Brennan can find
something that'll convince

21:37.203 --> 21:39.237
the judge to give us
that warrant.

21:43.309 --> 21:44.909
Oh, cool!

21:44.944 --> 21:46.377
I've heard about this baby.

21:46.412 --> 21:49.247
The Anatomage
virtual dissection table.

21:49.282 --> 21:51.716
Neat! I used to love playing
Operation when I was a kid.

21:51.751 --> 21:53.751
Remember? (buzzes)

21:53.787 --> 21:55.887
Well, you're gonna have to wait
a little bit for the real thing.

21:55.922 --> 21:58.556
Dr. Brennan had to explain to
the French how this thing works.

21:58.591 --> 21:59.690
They're scanning
the body now.

21:59.726 --> 22:01.125
So...

22:01.161 --> 22:02.927
any more big tremors?

22:02.962 --> 22:05.029
No, but no more ghosts either.

22:05.064 --> 22:07.799
Well, I guess
we'll never know.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.337
You know, I wouldn't
have believed it either,

22:13.373 --> 22:15.339
and then after
Lance died,

22:15.375 --> 22:19.143
I saw him, and he was
telling me to move on.

22:19.179 --> 22:22.046
And it really helped, so I
wasn't trying to be funny

22:22.081 --> 22:24.749
or flip, I just...
if someone's trying

22:24.784 --> 22:27.151
to give you a message,
I don't want you to miss it.

22:27.187 --> 22:28.786
Thanks, Daisy.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.592
Okay, was that
meant to be funny?

22:34.627 --> 22:37.395
I-I didn't do anything, I swear.

22:37.430 --> 22:40.631
You're not playing around?

22:40.667 --> 22:42.567
Daisy, I'm telling you,
there's got to be

22:42.602 --> 22:43.602
fault line activity here.

22:43.636 --> 22:44.602
Hodgins, listen to me.

22:44.637 --> 22:47.939
No one in this building
is feeling anything.

22:47.974 --> 22:49.874
If these jars were
just knocked over,

22:49.909 --> 22:51.909
that's three times.

22:51.945 --> 22:54.145
Three times someone,
or some thing,

22:54.180 --> 22:55.713
is trying to get
your attention.

22:55.748 --> 22:57.715
Okay, Daisy, stop, stop!
It-it's not a ghost, okay?

22:57.750 --> 23:00.551
Now, look, I'm tired,
my sadistic physical therapist

23:00.587 --> 23:02.653
worked me to the bone this
morning, and the last thing

23:02.689 --> 23:04.488
I want to do right now
is think about Patrick Swayze

23:04.524 --> 23:07.625
trying to send me a message,
so I know you mean well,

23:07.660 --> 23:11.095
but can we please just leave it?

23:11.130 --> 23:13.364
Sure.

23:13.399 --> 23:14.966
I'm sorry.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.439
(sighs)

23:24.077 --> 23:25.343
Get your warrant, Detective?

23:25.378 --> 23:27.311
It's, uh, agent.

23:27.347 --> 23:28.946
And I'm not here
to look in the house.

23:28.982 --> 23:29.947
I'm here for you.

23:29.983 --> 23:32.850
I'm flattered.

23:32.886 --> 23:36.988
So, tell me about, uh, your
relationship with the Marquis.

23:37.023 --> 23:38.890
He's been very
kind to me.

23:38.925 --> 23:41.392
He helped with my studies,
and, in return, I've helped him

23:41.427 --> 23:43.494
by watching over his
Virginia holdings.

23:43.529 --> 23:46.731
Okay, and were you watching
over his Virginia holdings

23:46.766 --> 23:49.200
when you spent
six months in Paris?

23:49.235 --> 23:50.635
(sighs)

23:50.670 --> 23:52.703
I study French
language and culture.

23:52.739 --> 23:54.505
The internship was part of that.

23:54.540 --> 23:55.640
Marquis was my sponsor.

23:55.675 --> 23:56.574
Internship.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.509
Is that a paid position?

23:58.544 --> 24:02.580
Because there are deposits here
for 200 grand in the last year.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.649
So either you're
getting overpaid

24:04.684 --> 24:07.251
or it's a little bit
more than an internship.

24:07.287 --> 24:09.120
Is there a question?

24:09.155 --> 24:10.321
Sure.

24:10.356 --> 24:12.823
Was stealing fancy French jewels
part of the internship,

24:12.859 --> 24:15.626
or was that just
extracurricular?

24:15.662 --> 24:18.162
I didn't steal anything;
neither did Henri.

24:18.197 --> 24:19.697
Were you sleeping with him?
No.

24:19.732 --> 24:21.365
So, if you're not
sleeping with him,

24:21.401 --> 24:23.034
you're not stealing with him,

24:23.069 --> 24:25.703
then how did all of that money
get into your account?

24:25.738 --> 24:29.807
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
answer that question.

24:29.842 --> 24:31.642
Maybe you wanted to be
the next Marquise De Chaussin,

24:31.678 --> 24:32.944
so you got rid of the last one.

24:32.979 --> 24:35.546
I told you.

24:35.581 --> 24:37.782
We weren't having an affair.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.786
She was.

24:41.821 --> 24:43.688
The Marquis would never

24:43.723 --> 24:47.325
say anything-- it's against
his nature to create a scandal--

24:47.360 --> 24:50.361
but his wife was
the one having an affair.

24:50.396 --> 24:52.229
With whom?
I don't know.

24:52.265 --> 24:55.132
But find out
who she was sleeping with,

24:55.168 --> 24:58.302
and maybe you'll find
the real killer.

25:02.308 --> 25:05.209
Are the files downloaded so we
can start the French autopsy?

25:05.244 --> 25:06.711
The time difference
slowed us down.

25:06.746 --> 25:08.312
They had to put people
on overtime

25:08.348 --> 25:10.715
to do the scans we need,
and we still don't have them.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.716
HODGINS:
We've been rewatching

25:11.751 --> 25:13.551
the heist video, calculating

25:13.586 --> 25:14.652
height, weight...

25:14.687 --> 25:15.720
BRENNAN:
You're hoping to prove

25:15.755 --> 25:17.021
the Marquis
and his intern

25:17.056 --> 25:18.322
are the thieves?

25:18.358 --> 25:19.423
Yeah, exactly.

25:19.459 --> 25:21.092
MONTENEGRO:
So far, it's possible

25:21.127 --> 25:24.362
that the quiet
thief is a woman.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.397
Wait, run that part again.

25:26.432 --> 25:30.267
The frame where
the case gets smashed.

25:30.303 --> 25:32.670
Okay, stop it right there.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.638
What, you see a tell?

25:34.674 --> 25:35.606
Yes, I do.

25:35.641 --> 25:37.141
So, is it a woman?
Yes.

25:37.176 --> 25:40.111
But it is not Blake Masters.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.246
Ms. Wick found

25:42.281 --> 25:44.281
sharp force injuries
on the metacarpals

25:44.317 --> 25:46.117
and phalanges,
but assumed they were

25:46.152 --> 25:48.486
postmortem injuries
from recycled glass.

25:48.521 --> 25:50.354
But what did you see
on the video?

25:50.390 --> 25:51.722
Well, the hammer
broke the case,

25:51.758 --> 25:55.793
but the thief's right hand
also went through the glass.

25:55.828 --> 25:57.895
That would have
sliced through a glove,

25:57.930 --> 25:59.897
creating wounds exactly

25:59.932 --> 26:02.633
like this, along with

26:02.668 --> 26:05.770
a Boxer's fracture on
the fifth metacarpal, the spot

26:05.805 --> 26:07.438
where the hand
impacted the case.

26:07.473 --> 26:08.939
HODGINS:
Wait a second.

26:08.975 --> 26:10.975
You're saying our victim
was the jewel thief?

26:11.010 --> 26:13.077
BRENNAN:
I'm saying that perhaps

26:13.112 --> 26:15.112
the Marquis and his wife
were in on this together.

26:15.148 --> 26:16.680
SAROYAN:
And if that's true,

26:16.716 --> 26:18.983
we know someone else
was in on it, as well.

26:19.018 --> 26:21.352
You've got
wounds like that,

26:21.387 --> 26:23.087
there's gonna be blood
on the glass shards

26:23.122 --> 26:24.555
at the scene
of the crime.

26:24.590 --> 26:25.823
Yeah, but there wasn't any.

26:25.858 --> 26:27.658
The saleswoman.

26:27.693 --> 26:29.527
She hid the evidence.

26:29.562 --> 26:31.562
SAROYAN: I guess we know
why it all went so smoothly.

26:31.597 --> 26:34.131
They had someone on the inside.

26:37.609 --> 26:39.431
Here's what I know, Eve.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.697
You've got a little girl
with heart issues,

26:41.797 --> 26:43.443
medical bills have
been piling up...

26:43.445 --> 26:44.644
I have no idea
what you're talking...

26:44.680 --> 26:45.846
We know there
should've been

26:45.881 --> 26:48.181
blood in the jewelry case
on the shattered glass.

26:48.217 --> 26:49.816
There wasn't.
You cleaned it up

26:49.852 --> 26:51.718
because you didn't want
us to I.D. your cohorts.

26:51.754 --> 26:53.153
So you're gonna
tell me now,

26:53.188 --> 26:55.756
who were the two thieves
that paid you

26:55.791 --> 26:58.091
to let them in?

26:58.127 --> 27:00.127
I only met one of them.

27:00.162 --> 27:03.096
She was French, I think.

27:03.132 --> 27:05.699
She was very nice
and she knew about my daughter.

27:07.369 --> 27:08.769
Yeah.

27:08.804 --> 27:11.138
She promised no one would
get hurt-- that was key.

27:11.173 --> 27:12.572
Now, you didn't know
the guy with her?

27:12.608 --> 27:13.507
What I told you

27:13.542 --> 27:14.775
was true: he had
a European accent,

27:14.810 --> 27:16.209
and that's all I knew.

27:16.245 --> 27:18.478
He could've been faking
it to throw you off.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.581
Maybe.
It was through a ski mask.

27:21.617 --> 27:23.083
All right, look, forget
about the voice, all right?

27:23.118 --> 27:24.251
Tell me how this worked.

27:24.286 --> 27:26.052
You called to let them know
the jewels came in...

27:26.088 --> 27:27.888
I had no idea wh-when the jewels.

27:27.923 --> 27:29.589
The woman, she told me when.

27:29.625 --> 27:30.924
She knew before you did?

27:30.959 --> 27:33.693
Yes. I-I assume they had
some in at the Gem Society.

27:33.729 --> 27:35.262
They're the only ones
who would know

27:35.297 --> 27:37.430
when the jewels
would get here.

27:48.811 --> 27:50.777
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, Cam?

27:50.813 --> 27:52.579
Oh, hey.
Hey.

27:52.614 --> 27:54.447
Uh, did you
lose something?

27:54.483 --> 27:58.118
Uh, yeah, I lost a thumb drive
earlier when I was setting up.

27:58.153 --> 27:59.789
Oh. Thought maybe you were
looking for your ghost.

27:59.813 --> 28:00.855
No.

28:00.856 --> 28:02.989
Now that I think about it,
I was probably wrong about that.

28:03.025 --> 28:03.990
Well, it was

28:04.026 --> 28:05.358
really weird.

28:05.394 --> 28:07.460
But maybe Hodgins is right,
maybe it was earthquakes.

28:07.496 --> 28:08.496
(phone beeping)

28:09.631 --> 28:10.631
Oh, good, it's here.

28:10.666 --> 28:12.165
The files from France?

28:12.201 --> 28:14.734
Uh, no. Aubrey asked me
to look into Chadwick Grey,

28:14.770 --> 28:16.436
the guy from
the Gem Society

28:16.471 --> 28:19.039
who put the microscopic code
on the diamonds.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.440
And?
And...

28:20.475 --> 28:22.142
before he worked
at the Gem Soc,

28:22.177 --> 28:25.145
he sold jewelry in Paris
at the first shop

28:25.180 --> 28:26.970
robbed by the Marquise.

28:26.994 --> 28:28.516
AUBREY: <i>We looked into</i>
<i>Mr. Grey.</i>

28:28.517 --> 28:30.150
You used to work
selling jewelry,

28:30.185 --> 28:31.718
and the last place

28:31.753 --> 28:33.153
you worked was robbed by thieves

28:33.188 --> 28:34.988
going after historical
knock-off jewels.

28:35.023 --> 28:36.389
That robbery is

28:36.425 --> 28:38.391
what made me want to help
secure such items.

28:38.427 --> 28:39.893
It led me to the Gem Society.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.061
See, the thief

28:41.096 --> 28:44.197
in that heist is
the same one here.

28:44.233 --> 28:46.533
Maybe you know her.

28:46.568 --> 28:48.969
Oh, heavens.

28:49.004 --> 28:50.737
No, you must be mistaken.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.340
The Marquise
was a customer.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.175
We got to know each other
quite well.

28:55.210 --> 28:56.877
She was so kind.

28:56.912 --> 28:59.312
She was interested
in what I did.

28:59.348 --> 29:02.048
I'm afraid she did ask a lot
of questions about my work.

29:02.084 --> 29:04.251
I guess
I flattered myself

29:04.286 --> 29:05.552
into thinking that

29:05.587 --> 29:07.187
maybe she was flirting with me.
Come on.

29:07.222 --> 29:09.122
You expect me to believe
that you didn't know

29:09.157 --> 29:10.557
you were giving her information?

29:10.592 --> 29:11.858
She's French royalty.

29:11.894 --> 29:13.627
Why would I suspect her
of anything?

29:13.662 --> 29:15.695
And now you're saying
she's a thief?

29:15.731 --> 29:16.663
You've arrested her?

29:16.698 --> 29:18.198
No, I'm saying she's dead.

29:18.233 --> 29:19.233
Oh, that's awful.

29:19.268 --> 29:20.333
I'm also saying

29:20.369 --> 29:22.836
that you were in on
this D.C. heist with her.

29:22.871 --> 29:24.771
No.
You marked the jewels,

29:24.806 --> 29:26.006
you told her when they'd arrive.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.374
You were either
in the store with her

29:27.409 --> 29:28.308
or you were just her source.

29:28.343 --> 29:30.410
No.
Either way,

29:30.445 --> 29:32.045
you're an accessory to murder.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.247
Or maybe you killed her
yourself.

29:34.283 --> 29:35.782
Why on earth
would I do that?

29:35.817 --> 29:37.250
Because you were having
an affair with her.

29:37.286 --> 29:39.452
(scoffs)

29:39.488 --> 29:40.720
I'm afraid you are mistaken.

29:40.756 --> 29:42.122
Well, here's what I'm
not mistaken about.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.491
The thief working with her
was six-foot-two,

29:44.526 --> 29:46.326
athletic build,
and knew exactly when

29:46.361 --> 29:48.128
the Topkapi Dagger
was gonna show up.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.763
Does that sound like
anybody you know?

29:49.798 --> 29:51.231
Maybe it does.

29:51.266 --> 29:52.332
If he was my size,

29:52.367 --> 29:54.567
then certainly
it could have been the Marquis.

29:54.603 --> 29:57.304
And you just happen to know
his height and weight?

29:57.339 --> 29:58.939
I said the Marquise
befriended me.

29:58.974 --> 30:01.274
I'd been invited to a black tie
event, and at that time,

30:01.310 --> 30:02.310
I owned no such thing,

30:02.344 --> 30:04.577
so she offered me one of

30:04.613 --> 30:06.947
her husband's tuxedos
because she could tell

30:06.982 --> 30:10.583
we were exactly the same size.

30:13.055 --> 30:15.488
I'm looking at the
French autopsy files,

30:15.524 --> 30:17.457
and they did do a
pretty thorough job.

30:17.492 --> 30:19.059
But we know something

30:19.094 --> 30:20.160
they didn't know.

30:20.195 --> 30:21.962
We know how
the Marquise was killed.

30:21.997 --> 30:23.330
You think it was the same M.O.?

30:23.365 --> 30:25.932
Okay, let's take
a look at the hyoid.

30:32.808 --> 30:36.776
Maybe a slight hairline
fracture, but the shape is off.

30:36.812 --> 30:40.413
I'm going to make a coronal cut.

30:51.293 --> 30:52.359
There.

30:52.394 --> 30:56.629
There are internal
microfractures just posterior

30:56.665 --> 30:58.565
of the lesser cornua.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.033
SAROYAN:
As if something pressed

31:00.068 --> 31:02.202
the hyoid back against
the vertebrae.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.269
MONTENEGRO:
So...

31:03.305 --> 31:04.305
she was strangled.

31:04.339 --> 31:05.739
It was the same M.O.

31:05.774 --> 31:06.740
Can you go back out

31:06.775 --> 31:08.341
to the opaque

31:08.377 --> 31:09.642
soft tissue rendering?

31:11.446 --> 31:13.179
This looks like
a sharp cut.

31:13.215 --> 31:14.614
Maybe a garrote?

31:14.649 --> 31:16.016
That could've pressed
the hyoid back.

31:16.051 --> 31:17.484
There's hemorrhaging

31:17.519 --> 31:20.286
in the strap muscles
and the garrote line has

31:20.322 --> 31:21.988
a slight cross right here.

31:22.024 --> 31:23.990
Meaning this victim was
strangled from the front

31:24.026 --> 31:26.760
instead of the back,
like the Marquise.

31:26.795 --> 31:28.828
The killer wasn't worried
about looking her in the eye,

31:28.864 --> 31:31.164
but with the Marquise,
he couldn't look at her.

31:31.199 --> 31:32.298
He had feelings for her.

31:32.334 --> 31:33.867
HODGINS: That's because
she was his wife.

31:33.902 --> 31:35.635
I can place the killing

31:35.670 --> 31:37.504
at the Marquis' estate.
So that tapestry

31:37.539 --> 31:40.373
had traces of tobacco,
and tobacco has a high affinity

31:40.409 --> 31:42.742
for the bioaccumulation
of heavy metals.

31:42.778 --> 31:44.010
In this case, uranium.

31:44.046 --> 31:45.712
Uranium?

31:45.747 --> 31:47.313
Like, uh, something nuclear?

31:47.349 --> 31:48.381
no.

31:48.417 --> 31:50.884
There's natural deposits
right here in Virginia

31:50.919 --> 31:55.188
underneath-- get this--
an old tobacco plantation,

31:55.223 --> 31:56.689
on top of which

31:56.725 --> 31:58.291
the Marquis
built his estate.

31:58.326 --> 32:01.061
Looks like we have enough
to get Booth that warrant.

32:03.198 --> 32:07.500
How was your afternoon
at the French Embassy?

32:08.970 --> 32:10.236
(laughs)

32:10.272 --> 32:11.838
You are...
you know what's crazy?

32:11.873 --> 32:13.540
How bad Aubrey is
at keeping secrets.

32:13.575 --> 32:15.542
What's crazy is that
you feel the need

32:15.577 --> 32:17.610
to lie to your wife about
going to the eye doctor.

32:17.646 --> 32:20.447
Okay. Yeah, well,
"I told you so,"

32:20.482 --> 32:22.615
okay, isn't your
finest quality, Bones.

32:22.651 --> 32:24.084
But, all right, here.

32:24.119 --> 32:25.885
Here you go.

32:25.921 --> 32:27.787
Take your best shot.

32:27.823 --> 32:30.623
My, don't you look
distinguished.

32:30.659 --> 32:31.958
I look ridiculous.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.894
No, Booth, you
look... you look hot.

32:34.930 --> 32:36.796
Seriously, come on.
I look like a squint.

32:36.832 --> 32:39.132
What's wrong with
looking intelligent?

32:39.167 --> 32:40.733
Brains and looks
can go hand-in-hand.

32:40.769 --> 32:42.268
Uh, look, it doesn't matter,
all right?

32:42.304 --> 32:44.270
They're temporary.
Understand?

32:44.306 --> 32:47.373
There's just some accumulation
of fluid under the retina.

32:47.409 --> 32:49.909
Central serous
chorioretinopathy?

32:49.945 --> 32:51.344
Yeah, that...
it might be that.

32:51.379 --> 32:53.480
No, that's usually
just in one eye.

32:53.515 --> 32:55.381
Usually. Not always.

32:55.417 --> 32:57.817
Okay, so the doctor said
just give it a day or two.

32:57.853 --> 32:59.586
So what do you say we just
give it a day or two, okay?

32:59.621 --> 33:01.588
Okay.
(phone rings)

33:01.623 --> 33:02.555
Way to keep a secret, Aubrey.

33:02.591 --> 33:03.656
AUBREY:
Look, we got bigger problems

33:03.692 --> 33:05.158
than your dorky glasses, okay?

33:05.193 --> 33:06.426
The judge wasn't home.

33:06.461 --> 33:08.294
You were supposed to wait.
Yeah, and I was planning on it

33:08.330 --> 33:10.396
till I got a call
from my buddy over at State.

33:10.432 --> 33:11.598
Gave me a heads up.

33:11.633 --> 33:13.399
The Marquis is
booked on a flight

33:13.435 --> 33:14.501
out of D.C.,
first thing in the morning.

33:14.536 --> 33:15.802
He's making a run for it.

33:15.837 --> 33:16.769
Yeah, well, he's not
gonna get far.

33:16.805 --> 33:17.971
I jumped the fence.
(glass shatters)

33:18.006 --> 33:19.472
I'm keeping an eye on the house.
(alarm blaring)

33:19.508 --> 33:20.707
BOOTH:
What the hell was that?

33:20.742 --> 33:22.075
Oh, never mind that warrant.

33:22.110 --> 33:23.543
There's been a break-in.
I got probable cause.

33:23.578 --> 33:24.611
I'm going in.

33:24.646 --> 33:25.845
No, you're not, Aubrey. Wait.

33:25.881 --> 33:27.113
No, there's no time, Booth.

33:27.149 --> 33:28.481
Going to catch a thief.

33:30.552 --> 33:33.319
(alarm continues blaring)

33:40.295 --> 33:42.428
(door opens)

33:50.505 --> 33:53.506
MARQUIS: You move an inch
and I'll kill you!

33:55.377 --> 33:57.243
Drop the gun.

33:57.279 --> 33:58.511
Gladly.

33:58.547 --> 34:00.713
But then you must
arrest this lunatic.

34:00.749 --> 34:01.948
No, no, no, no, no.

34:01.983 --> 34:03.183
It's not me
he's going to arrest.

34:03.218 --> 34:04.784
This man broke into my house.

34:04.819 --> 34:07.453
And I found this
under your mattress.

34:11.377 --> 34:15.031
Can't you see? It's Rousseau.
He's setting me up.

34:15.130 --> 34:18.099
It's a good thing you ran
the video the whole time.

34:18.134 --> 34:19.974
But we still got you
for breaking and entering.

34:20.003 --> 34:21.402
Oh, that will go away.

34:21.438 --> 34:22.904
You don't think
he's gonna press charges?

34:22.938 --> 34:25.540
Oh, I know he won't,
because if I go to trial,

34:25.574 --> 34:28.342
I will tell every sordid little
detail about the Marquis.

34:28.378 --> 34:30.578
Scandal is
anathema to him.

34:30.614 --> 34:32.045
You're pretty smart
for a Frenchman.

34:32.081 --> 34:33.947
He was leaving town.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.850
You are bound by
American rules.

34:35.886 --> 34:38.253
It's something we don't worry
about in France, you know.

34:38.288 --> 34:39.853
And now we have
the smoking gun,

34:39.889 --> 34:42.991
or the smoking dagger,
perhaps. <i>De rien.</i>

34:43.025 --> 34:44.692
AUBREY:
Let me spell this out for you.

34:44.728 --> 34:46.327
You lost your family fortune.

34:46.362 --> 34:47.594
You needed a ton of money

34:47.630 --> 34:49.597
to keep
your fancy lifestyle going,

34:49.632 --> 34:51.766
so you decided
to become a jewel thief.

34:51.801 --> 34:53.268
No.
Okay, then,

34:53.303 --> 34:54.869
Your Highness,
why don't you tell me

34:54.905 --> 34:56.771
where all that money's
coming from.

34:56.806 --> 34:58.339
(sighs)

35:00.243 --> 35:02.644
Do you know what it's like

35:02.679 --> 35:05.380
being responsible
for ending four centuries

35:05.415 --> 35:07.849
of a certain lifestyle?

35:07.884 --> 35:10.118
Utter humiliation.

35:10.153 --> 35:12.053
Which is why Blake Masters

35:12.088 --> 35:13.454
came into my life.

35:13.490 --> 35:15.256
I'm not following
how she fits in here.

35:15.292 --> 35:16.658
Her area of study

35:16.693 --> 35:18.293
is French antiquities.

35:18.328 --> 35:21.062
She did a fascinating thesis
documenting their history,

35:21.097 --> 35:24.465
but more importantly,
their current value.

35:24.501 --> 35:27.135
Which is why I enlisted
her to sell off

35:27.170 --> 35:30.104
the family heirlooms,
as quietly as possible.

35:30.140 --> 35:32.573
She was your broker?

35:32.609 --> 35:35.243
She was very kind
to keep my indiscretions,

35:35.278 --> 35:37.946
even at the peril
of you thinking she's a thief.

35:37.981 --> 35:41.082
But I cannot allow
this to continue.

35:41.117 --> 35:43.284
All the money
can be accounted for.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.153
If you had all that money,

35:45.188 --> 35:47.689
what's your wife doing
stealing jewels?

35:47.724 --> 35:49.390
That is preposterous.

35:49.426 --> 35:50.358
Oh, no.

35:50.393 --> 35:52.327
That we've already proven.

35:52.362 --> 35:55.029
Okay.

35:55.065 --> 35:58.166
I didn't always know
where she was.

35:58.201 --> 36:00.735
I thought... feared...

36:00.770 --> 36:02.003
She was having an affair?

36:02.038 --> 36:05.006
Yes.

36:05.041 --> 36:08.710
But now you're saying that
Isabelle was stealing jewels?

36:08.745 --> 36:11.346
(laughs)

36:11.381 --> 36:14.549
<i>C'est impossible. Impossible.</i>

36:14.584 --> 36:16.617
HODGINS: So as you can see,
there's a nick in the blade

36:16.653 --> 36:18.586
that wasn't there in the
photo from the Gem Society,

36:18.621 --> 36:19.821
so it had to have hit

36:19.856 --> 36:20.822
something hard.

36:20.857 --> 36:21.990
I mean, maybe bone.

36:22.025 --> 36:23.391
Well, perhaps, although,

36:23.426 --> 36:25.326
Ms. Wick and I have
triple-checked.

36:25.362 --> 36:28.696
The Marquis' wife was...
was not stabbed. (sighs)

36:28.732 --> 36:30.598
Wait a minute.

36:30.633 --> 36:33.101
What if the killer
was stabbed in the struggle?

36:39.976 --> 36:42.343
Nope. The weapon
was wiped clean.

36:42.379 --> 36:45.580
Damn it. This guy
was really careful.

36:45.615 --> 36:47.849
Wait. He-he may
have been careful,

36:47.884 --> 36:51.119
but the killer had an emotional
connection with his victim.

36:51.154 --> 36:53.388
Perhaps,
he wasn't thinking clearly.

36:53.423 --> 36:55.256
Meaning?

36:55.291 --> 36:56.924
Meaning he did
what you did naturally.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.727
He sheathed the dagger
before he thought to clean it.

36:59.763 --> 37:02.563
So there could still be
blood on the inside.

37:16.046 --> 37:16.978
(chuckles)

37:17.013 --> 37:18.346
(imitating Clouseau):
Voila.

37:18.381 --> 37:22.250
Inspector Clouseau
triumphs once again.

37:22.285 --> 37:25.353
I still don't understand why
you're talking like that.

37:25.388 --> 37:27.422
BOOTH: <i>So three days ago,</i>
<i>Inspector Rousseau</i>

37:27.457 --> 37:29.123
<i>met with the Marquis' wife.</i>

37:29.159 --> 37:31.893
He, uh, he said that
there had been a murder

37:31.928 --> 37:33.461
in France on
the last heist.

37:33.496 --> 37:35.096
But I don't understand.

37:35.131 --> 37:36.998
Why are you telling me this?
Well, because

37:37.033 --> 37:38.566
Rousseau got
something wrong.

37:38.601 --> 37:40.168
He thought that her husband
was the jewel thief.

37:40.203 --> 37:41.702
Turns out that

37:41.738 --> 37:44.072
she was the jewel thief,
and you were the accomplice.

37:44.107 --> 37:47.008
(laughs):
No. I explained all this.

37:47.043 --> 37:48.543
BRENNAN:
You killed your scout

37:48.578 --> 37:51.245
in France by strangling her
with a garrote.

37:51.281 --> 37:52.747
You looked her in the eye,

37:52.782 --> 37:54.549
as you made sure
she couldn't talk.

37:54.584 --> 37:56.551
No.
When she found out,

37:56.586 --> 37:59.187
she was gonna turn you in
or tell her husband.

37:59.222 --> 38:02.090
You couldn't let her do that,
so you grabbed this

38:02.125 --> 38:04.258
off the dresser,
and you strangled her, too.

38:04.294 --> 38:06.294
BOOTH: This time,
you couldn't look

38:06.329 --> 38:08.062
into her eyes, because
you'd fallen in love with her.

38:08.098 --> 38:09.630
I think this has gone
far enough.

38:09.666 --> 38:11.232
I'm gonna have to call
a solicitor.

38:11.267 --> 38:13.234
That's fine, Chadwick.
You do whatever you want,

38:13.269 --> 38:14.936
'cause right now we're in
the process of gathering

38:14.971 --> 38:18.873
all this evidence so we can
get a court order for your DNA.

38:18.908 --> 38:21.109
Actually, Booth,
I'm-I'm not sure we need DNA

38:21.144 --> 38:22.643
to prove that he did this.

38:22.679 --> 38:24.245
And why exactly is that?

38:24.280 --> 38:27.915
Because as you strangled her,
she took this dagger

38:27.951 --> 38:30.318
and swung it backward,

38:30.353 --> 38:33.287
hitting you... here.

38:33.323 --> 38:35.022
Or perhaps it was here.
(winces)

38:35.058 --> 38:37.091
BOOTH: Ouch.
BRENNAN: Then you planted the dagger

38:37.127 --> 38:38.727
to make the Marquis
look like the killer.

38:38.761 --> 38:40.161
Good work, Bones.

38:46.369 --> 38:47.969
I did love her.

38:48.004 --> 38:50.138
I wanted to
run away with her.

38:50.173 --> 38:53.541
When Rousseau got close,
I knew we had to run.

38:53.576 --> 38:55.343
But she never wanted me.

38:55.378 --> 38:58.546
All she wanted was to buy back
her husband's bloody heirlooms.

38:58.581 --> 39:00.181
He's an arrogant aristocrat.

39:00.216 --> 39:02.250
All he cares about is status.

39:03.853 --> 39:06.787
How could she have chosen him
over me?

39:10.393 --> 39:11.526
(sighs)

39:11.561 --> 39:13.995
So you found evidence
of a ghost.

39:14.030 --> 39:15.863
Trust me,
you'll want to see this.

39:15.899 --> 39:16.797
Okay, Daisy, listen,

39:16.833 --> 39:18.366
I respect what
you believe,

39:18.401 --> 39:19.867
but if you've been in here
playing Ghostbuster,

39:19.903 --> 39:21.269
I'm telling you,
all it's gonna do

39:21.304 --> 39:22.570
is make me want to eat
a giant marshmallow.

39:22.605 --> 39:23.771
Just pay attention.

39:23.806 --> 39:26.174
When I left you
in this room,

39:26.209 --> 39:28.309
you were,
if you don't mind...

39:28.344 --> 39:29.577
right here.

39:29.612 --> 39:31.746
Right. Okay,
and where was Casper?

39:31.781 --> 39:32.914
You were here

39:32.949 --> 39:35.249
when you heard the crash
that knocked over these jars.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.585
And... oh, so you found
ghost particulates on the jars.

39:37.620 --> 39:38.553
No.

39:38.588 --> 39:40.288
I looked under the table.

39:40.323 --> 39:41.522
The jars knocked

39:41.558 --> 39:42.857
because the
table knocked.

39:42.892 --> 39:44.725
By a really strong ghost.

39:44.761 --> 39:46.761
Hodgins, would you shut up
and listen?

39:48.865 --> 39:52.033
Your foot is three inches
off the ground when it rests

39:52.068 --> 39:53.534
in the footrest
of the wheelchair.

39:53.570 --> 39:55.336
You're wearing shoes
with a lightweight

39:55.371 --> 39:58.406
flexible outsole
of man-made rubber

39:58.441 --> 39:59.640
with a crisscross pattern.

39:59.676 --> 40:01.342
Okay, you're really starting
to freak me out now.

40:01.377 --> 40:02.243
19 inches above ground,

40:02.278 --> 40:04.912
on the back pole
of the side table,

40:04.948 --> 40:07.048
exactly 21 inches from the point

40:07.083 --> 40:10.351
where your leg would be
resting in the chair,

40:10.386 --> 40:12.987
I found trace
from that exact rubber.

40:14.991 --> 40:17.291
For a genius,
you're being dense.

40:18.795 --> 40:20.895
You kicked the table.

40:20.930 --> 40:22.496
Okay.

40:22.532 --> 40:26.200
Um, Daisy, maybe you're not
aware of this whole

40:26.236 --> 40:27.602
paralysis thing
I've got going on.

40:27.637 --> 40:29.170
Maybe you
don't remember

40:29.205 --> 40:31.906
your sadistic physical therapist
who's been working your muscles

40:31.941 --> 40:33.474
to reignite
their memory patterns.

40:33.509 --> 40:35.509
Hold on. Wait, wait.

40:35.545 --> 40:37.144
It's science, Hodgins.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.846
You were right.

40:38.881 --> 40:40.514
It wasn't a poltergeist.

40:40.550 --> 40:41.983
It wasn't an earthquake.

40:42.018 --> 40:43.551
It was you.

40:43.586 --> 40:46.120
Your muscles spasmed.
I read about it.

40:46.155 --> 40:48.356
It means
that they can fire again.

40:48.391 --> 40:50.491
This might be
the first step.

40:50.526 --> 40:51.993
MONTENEGRO:
First step to what?

40:52.028 --> 40:53.094
You sure about this?

40:53.129 --> 40:55.096
A-About the-the trace
under the table?

40:56.099 --> 40:57.798
What are you guys talking about?

40:57.834 --> 40:59.600
First step to what?

41:00.837 --> 41:04.272
We're talking about
a-a first step to...

41:04.307 --> 41:06.040
a first step.

41:06.075 --> 41:09.043
M-My leg, it, uh...

41:09.078 --> 41:10.645
So all this stuff's been

41:10.680 --> 41:12.847
moving around me...

41:12.882 --> 41:15.583
because it's moving.

41:15.618 --> 41:18.319
I can't control it.

41:18.354 --> 41:22.023
I-I can't feel it, yet.

41:22.058 --> 41:26.994
Angie, I think Nurse Ratched's
gonna help me walk again.

41:34.137 --> 41:35.803
This is very thoughtful
of you, Inspector.

41:35.838 --> 41:37.872
Well, you know,
your husband was kind enough

41:37.907 --> 41:41.342
to call my superior, who has
seen it fit to reinstate me.

41:41.377 --> 41:42.743
But even though
you were wrong.

41:42.779 --> 41:44.345
The Marquis was
not the killer.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.814
Well, whose fault was that?
He was hiding the truth.

41:46.849 --> 41:47.982
Well, you're still wrong.

41:48.017 --> 41:49.317
Don't you owe him an apology?

41:49.352 --> 41:50.551
Go let him eat cake.

41:50.586 --> 41:52.153
Cake. Ouch.
I mean, please.

41:52.188 --> 41:53.688
Come on, his kind
has been saying that

41:53.723 --> 41:55.489
to my kind for centuries.
In any case,

41:55.525 --> 41:57.792
the crimes were solved;
it's all that matters.

41:57.827 --> 41:59.026
Well, you know,
the truth is

41:59.062 --> 42:00.895
I would have
done the same as you.

42:00.930 --> 42:02.063
Eh, see?

42:02.098 --> 42:05.199
Well, I want to
thank you both very much,

42:05.234 --> 42:07.301
and, uh, I bid you adieu, huh?

42:07.337 --> 42:08.602
<i>De rien.</i>
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

42:08.638 --> 42:10.137
Okay, take care, pal.
<i>Merci. Au revoir.</i>

42:10.173 --> 42:11.272
<i>Merci.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>

42:11.307 --> 42:12.840
Bon voyage.
<i>Merci.</i>

42:12.875 --> 42:15.009
(both speak French)

42:17.513 --> 42:20.314
What the heck? This looks like
a pretty good bottle of wine.

42:20.350 --> 42:22.450
Oh, you can read that
without your glasses?

42:22.485 --> 42:24.051
I told you it was,
just like the doctor said,

42:24.087 --> 42:25.820
it was temporary, you know?

42:25.855 --> 42:27.621
I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling healthy and young.

42:27.657 --> 42:29.790
I have my 20/10 vision back,

42:29.826 --> 42:31.559
and I don't need
to squint anymore.

42:31.594 --> 42:33.561
That's too bad.

42:33.596 --> 42:35.529
Why? You really
like those glasses?

42:35.565 --> 42:36.931
They were sexy, Booth.

42:36.966 --> 42:38.399
I mean, you know,

42:38.434 --> 42:41.702
I was kind of hoping
you'd wear them to bed.

42:41.738 --> 42:43.938
To bed? Why?

42:43.973 --> 42:46.107
Well, I was hoping
you'd wear them

42:46.142 --> 42:47.475
and nothing else.
Wow. Really?

42:47.510 --> 42:49.310
Okay.

42:49.345 --> 42:52.246
I think I can
accommodate that.

42:52.281 --> 42:54.682
Well, not like that, Booth.
That's not attractive.

42:54.717 --> 42:55.646
Well, that's how
they're gonna end up.

42:55.647 --> 42:56.315
They look wonky.

42:56.319 --> 42:57.559
Well, they may
end up like that,

42:57.587 --> 42:58.786
but I don't want them
to start like that.

42:58.821 --> 43:00.087
How about you? Here,
you try them on.

43:00.123 --> 43:01.922
Let's start...
Okay, you can see.

43:01.958 --> 43:03.758
Whoa, how do you
even see with them?

43:04.338 --> 43:05.504
Are you serious?
