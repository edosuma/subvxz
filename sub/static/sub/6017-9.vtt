00:03.536 --> 00:06.004
With a serial killer,
it's safest to be a neighbor.

00:06.206 --> 00:09.175
They never kill the neighbor.
The neighbor survives to do...

00:09.342 --> 00:12.175
...the interview afterwards, right?
"He was kind of quiet."

00:12.345 --> 00:14.575
These neighbors,
they're never disturbed...

00:14.781 --> 00:17.181
...by the sounds of murdering.
Just stereo.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.181
Chain saws, people screaming, fine.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.684
Just keep the music down.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.250
And women who fall in love
with the killer.

00:24.424 --> 00:28.224
They write to him in prison. Here's
a woman that's hard to disappoint.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.258
She's only upset
when she finds out...

00:30.430 --> 00:32.591
...he's stopped killing people.
And she goes:

00:32.799 --> 00:36.394
"You know, sometimes I feel like I don't
even know who you are anymore."

00:42.675 --> 00:45.007
<i>No. Eight years
isn't such a long streak.</i>

00:45.178 --> 00:48.443
-It isn't?
-No. I haven't vomited in 13 years.

00:49.816 --> 00:53.877
-Get out.
-Not since June 29th, 1980.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.850
You remember the date?

00:56.056 --> 01:01.926
Yes. Because my previous vomit
was also June 29th, 1972.

01:02.095 --> 01:05.622
That's why during the '80 vomit
I was yelling to George:

01:05.832 --> 01:10.201
"Can you believe it?
I'm vomiting on June 29th again."

01:10.637 --> 01:13.401
When Joel told me he hadn't
thrown up in eight years...

01:13.573 --> 01:16.599
...I was wondering if he was normal.
-<i>No, Elaine, he's normal.</i>

01:16.843 --> 01:19.437
Your boyfriend is normal.
He just has the same name...

01:19.612 --> 01:21.944
...as one of the worst serial killers
in history.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.946
Oh, Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.746
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.889
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.388
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. What's his name?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.457
-Joel.
-Joel what?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.092
Rifkin.

01:36.496 --> 01:40.455
-Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
-Yeah. It's just a coincidence...

01:40.633 --> 01:42.464
...obviously.
-Guess you better...

01:42.635 --> 01:44.296
...keep on his good side.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.103
Very funny. That's very funny.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.401
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him if I were you.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.737
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that. Enough.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.608
If you smell anything
decaying in his car's trunk...

01:55.815 --> 01:58.079
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.980
He's a gentleman. He's good-looking,
he's a good shaver.

02:01.154 --> 02:04.920
And he hasn't thrown up in eight years,
so just shut up about him. Shut up!

02:08.127 --> 02:10.858
The whole city is talking
about this monster, Joel Rifkin.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.861
And I am dating a Joel Rifkin.

02:13.032 --> 02:17.935
-But you like your Joel Rifkin.
-Yeah. I wish he had a different name.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.765
Ask him to change it.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.601
You can't ask a person
to change their name.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.107
-Why not?
-Would you change yours?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.336
If someone asked me nicely.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.512
I'm Claude Seinfeld.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.617
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?

02:33.786 --> 02:35.151
Yeah, 18 strangles.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.448
You know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?

02:37.624 --> 02:39.649
Because he was adopted.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.785
Just like Son of Sam was adopted.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.864
So apparently, adoption leads
to serial killing.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.304
Joel and I have an extra ticket
to the Giants game.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.963
-I'll go.
-Okay.

02:56.509 --> 03:00.240
-I'll leave a ticket for you at will call.
-Yeah!

03:02.649 --> 03:04.139
Should I have asked George?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.648
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?

03:06.819 --> 03:08.650
-Karen?
-Risotto.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.853
I feel full after the risotto.

03:11.090 --> 03:14.719
-Oh, the risotto broad.
-Yeah.

03:14.994 --> 03:17.986
He's got a good thing with her.
I'm doubling with them tonight.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.556
-You don't like double dates.
-George does.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.031
He feels it's a good
personality showcase.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.194
He likes a date to see him
with a friend...

03:25.371 --> 03:27.896
...so she gets a window
into his non-date personality.

03:28.341 --> 03:31.833
I've looked through that window and
screamed at him to shut the blinds.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.877
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.847
-And you're taking..?
-Jodi, the masseuse.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.213
-Hey, did you get a massage yet?
-No.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.618
How many times do I have to go out
with her before I get a massage?

03:44.991 --> 03:48.518
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She
doesn't want to give them on dates.

03:48.728 --> 03:52.061
Yeah, I know. She just wants
to have sex.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.630
So what?

03:53.800 --> 03:56.360
It's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.

03:56.703 --> 04:00.434
I like carrots, but I'm in Idaho,
I want a potato.

04:03.376 --> 04:07.369
So I go into this clothing store,
and the saleswoman is wearing this...

04:07.580 --> 04:09.070
...low-cut thing.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.410
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?

04:11.584 --> 04:15.281
When you put on a top like that,
what's your thought process?

04:15.521 --> 04:17.648
What's going on in your mind?"

04:17.890 --> 04:19.584
That is so funny.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.959
-You listening to this?
-Yeah, I heard you.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.722
Boy, my neck is killing me.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.634
It's right in this spot.
Very tender over here.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.600
So, what did she say?

04:32.805 --> 04:35.968
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.741
You just said you said it.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.539
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.410
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.279
I've never seen you like this.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.080
It's like somebody's
pulling on wires back here.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.320
It's like, you never see
a really attractive woman...

04:54.494 --> 04:56.155
...getting a traffic ticket.

04:56.329 --> 04:59.821
How can you say that?
My sister got a ticket last week.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.763
Are you saying she's not attractive?

05:03.202 --> 05:06.000
Obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.765
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.000
-Can we go?
-So soon?

05:11.177 --> 05:13.611
-Yeah. Good seeing you again, Karen.
-Yeah.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.873
-Nice meeting you, Karen.
-Yeah, I'll call about that massage.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.640
-Yeah.
-Let's do this again soon.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.683
Yeah.

05:24.357 --> 05:28.316
-I strained my neck last night.
-Really, how?

05:28.494 --> 05:31.019
I tried brushing my teeth
by holding the brush...

05:31.197 --> 05:33.825
...and moving my head
from side to side.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.990
It didn't work.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.065
So, what's the deal
with your friend George?

05:39.238 --> 05:40.671
No deal. Why?

05:40.840 --> 05:44.105
What was all that "attractive women
not getting tickets" nonsense?

05:44.310 --> 05:47.643
Well, he was just showcasing
his non-date personality.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.342
How can you hang out with him?

05:50.516 --> 05:53.974
Yeah, sometimes
it really makes me tense.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.313
Did you see
the way that he was eating?

05:57.490 --> 05:59.481
Yeah, he's disgusting.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.926
I have to tell you,
I really don't like him.

06:03.129 --> 06:06.098
-Yeah, me either.
-It's just I hate that type.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.165
He's a bad seed.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.502
Now, you, however, you, I like.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.374
-What are you doing?
-What do you think I'm doing?

06:21.247 --> 06:24.683
-So, what do you think?
-Really enjoyed it.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.715
-Jodi's nice.
-She's very nice.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.651
Let's discuss this later.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.347
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.

06:33.226 --> 06:38.289
-I was personable, don't you think?
-You were extremely personable.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.398
Because I thought I picked up
a little something.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.229
I'm very good at this.
Did you pick up anything?

06:44.437 --> 06:49.067
-I didn't pick up anything.
-The second time I sent noodles back...

06:50.076 --> 06:51.873
...I thought she made a face.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.769
I didn't see a face.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.742
I thought I saw a face.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.783
-What is the difference?
-No difference. I could care less.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.888
-She's Jerry's girlfriend.
-George, instead of talking about this...

07:04.090 --> 07:06.183
...we could be... You know.

07:08.327 --> 07:09.988
So you think she liked me?

07:11.000 --> 07:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:18.271 --> 07:21.069
-What are you doing?
-Massaging your neck.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.569
Of course. Massaging.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.737
Boning up on football?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.417
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?

07:32.585 --> 07:36.316
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.314
What a cool name, Deion.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.017
If I were gonna change my name,
I'd go with Deion.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.997
Deion Benes?

07:45.231 --> 07:46.926
Well, as a woman,
it makes no sense.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.935
But I mean...
Well, let's say I was you.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.333
And I decided I was gonna
change my name...

07:53.506 --> 07:55.872
For no real reason whatsoever.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.666
Deion Rifkin.

08:00.513 --> 08:03.539
That is so cool.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.384
Deion Rifkin?

08:07.186 --> 08:09.051
Well, maybe you're not
the Deion type.

08:09.255 --> 08:13.817
Okay, then let's see, let's see,
what do we got? Oh, oh, oh, O.J.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.759
O.J. Rifkin. Oh, you don't even use
a name. It's just initials.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.127
Oh, please, please, change your name
to O.J. It would be so great.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.666
Elaine, what is going on?

08:27.039 --> 08:30.475
-She stayed over?
-Yeah.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.971
-Sex wasn't so good?
-No. Sex was fabulous.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.515
-So?
-I want the massage.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.686
-Did you ask her?
-I put her hands there.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.585
She just pulls it away immediately.
She's not into it.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.350
-Why not?
-I guess because it's her job.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.088
It's very frustrating.

08:52.064 --> 08:55.192
So we had a good time,
the four of us.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.995
-Yeah.
-We all got along.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.660
-Everyone seemed very pleasant.
-Yeah.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.397
-What did Jodi say?
-She had a good time.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.508
-Is that it?
-Pretty much.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.844
She say anything about..?

09:09.048 --> 09:11.346
-What?
-No, no. It's all right. Great.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.882
She had a good time.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.080
Yeah.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.586
-You hesitated.
-I was blowing on the coffee.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.553
She didn't like me.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.557
It's not like you'll be spending
a lot of time with her.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.129
So she doesn't like me?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.356
No.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.570
-She said that?
-Yes.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.905
-She told you she doesn't like me?
-Yes.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.743
-What were her exact..?
-"I don't like him."

09:44.250 --> 09:45.615
Why didn't she like me?

09:45.851 --> 09:48.115
-Not everybody likes everybody.
-I wasn't nice?

09:48.354 --> 09:51.653
-You were very nice.
-I bent over backwards for that woman!

09:51.857 --> 09:55.258
-Was it what I said about her sister?
-It has nothing to do with her.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.396
I don't even know her sister!
But if she's getting tickets...

09:58.564 --> 10:00.794
...she's not that good-looking!

10:03.002 --> 10:04.663
You vomited in 1987.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.735
Oh, no. That was the dry heaves.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.770
-Jodi.
-Hi, Jerry.

10:08.941 --> 10:13.241
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.938
-I was giving Kramer a massage.
-Kramer.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.008
Gotta run, I have an appointment.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.983
-Let me take your table.
-That's okay.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.621
Please. I love to help people.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.350
This is what I do.
Come on, I'm going this way.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.153
I'll see you tonight.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.126
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.293
Who told you to get a massage?
I haven't gotten one from her!

10:38.471 --> 10:41.929
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing, buddy.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.109
No one hails a cab like me.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.176
My hailing technique is unmatched.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.438
See, I get the wrist going
side to side and:

10:48.614 --> 10:51.447
Cabs are crashing into themselves
to just pick me up.

10:51.617 --> 10:54.711
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.548
Feminists aside,
I know women like the door-holding.

10:57.723 --> 11:01.284
Here we are. Alrighty. Good. Okay.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.018
Let's get together again soon.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.390
-Say hello to your sister.
-You've never met.

11:05.564 --> 11:09.660
Whatever. If I wasn't involved right
now, I wouldn't mind being set up.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.998
Something tells me
she's a knockout!

11:13.205 --> 11:15.196
But first, she sets
the mood perfectly...

11:15.441 --> 11:19.400
...with this New Age music
played over ocean sounds.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.739
Then she lays you out on this table.

11:22.314 --> 11:27.877
And she proceeds to rub oil
over your entire body.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.989
And she rubs long and deep.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.683
Jerry, she rubs with love.

11:36.529 --> 11:41.489
Every muscle she touches
just oozes...

11:42.068 --> 11:44.366
...beneath those silky, soft fingers.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.369
You can scarcely
contain yourself, buddy.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.565
-So you had a good time, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.040
-Enjoyed yourself?
-Very much.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.374
All right, now, you listen,
and you listen good!

11:55.781 --> 11:57.248
-What?
-The massages are out!

11:57.416 --> 11:59.577
-What..?
-They're out!

11:59.752 --> 12:02.687
-Why?
-If I can't get one, you're not!

12:02.888 --> 12:06.984
Wait a minute. I need my massages.
Can't you see I'm burned out?

12:10.796 --> 12:15.563
-I'm sorry, Kramer.
-Why, why? Look, I paid for her!

12:16.869 --> 12:19.133
Don't you ever
talk about her like that!

12:19.305 --> 12:23.002
-Yeah, but why?!
-Final!

12:26.145 --> 12:29.137
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Giants Stadium.</i>

12:29.381 --> 12:31.747
-Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
-Yeah.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.818
-Why, is that weird?
-No, it's normal.

12:35.054 --> 12:39.457
You're very normal.
You're totally normal.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.457
-Who's this?
-That's my mother.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.823
Oh, yeah. I see the resemblance.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.933
-No, there's no resemblance.
-Yeah, there is. Right here...

12:50.102 --> 12:52.332
Elaine, I was adopted.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.141
Oh, that's nice.

12:56.342 --> 13:00.438
Oh, the game's about to start.
I wonder where your friend Kramer is.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.680
Yeah, a ticket for Kramer?

13:08.254 --> 13:11.781
-Here it is. I need some ID.
-Oh, yeah.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.586
-You know, I forgot my wallet.
-Well, I can't give it to you then.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.593
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm afraid not.

13:22.802 --> 13:27.171
Come on, just look at me.
Now tell me I'm not Kramer.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.667
-I'm sorry. I need proof.
-Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow...

13:31.844 --> 13:33.311
...and I'll show you the ID.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.379
I got nothing to do all day.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.014
Neither do I.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.049
But without ID...

13:40.219 --> 13:43.279
...I need confirmation
from the person who left the ticket.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.719
Where's a phone?

13:47.126 --> 13:51.654
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.</i>

13:52.131 --> 13:56.568
<i>Would Joel Rifkin
report to the stadium office.</i>

13:56.735 --> 13:59.966
<i>Joel Rifkin, telephone.</i>

14:00.239 --> 14:03.106
Who would be calling me here?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.804
He's not the murderer.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.182
Oh, God.

14:18.157 --> 14:21.251
-What's the matter with you?
-Jerry, I need another massage.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.859
You just had one.
What do you need another one for?

14:24.063 --> 14:26.725
Because of the Giant game.
I told you, it went overtime.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.390
You know those seats.
They're very unforgiving.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.433
-Oh, please.
-And then the game-winning field goal...

14:32.638 --> 14:37.735
...went over the net and into the crowd,
and I dove over three rows.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.173
My back, it's killing me.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.045
It's killing me, Jerry!

14:43.349 --> 14:46.910
-Well, did you get the ball?
-Oh, I got the ball.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.281
I never caught a foul ball
at a baseball game.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.046
Well, it's quite a thrill.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.250
-Well, get somebody else.
-Nobody does it like she does.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.588
-She's the best.
-Tonight's the night.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.197
I'm getting one. No ifs, ands or buts.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.563
-Well, what about my massage?
-Ask Newman.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.740
So I lugged that table,
that big, heavy massage table...

15:10.910 --> 15:12.673
...all the way down to the cab!

15:13.279 --> 15:16.271
-You ever see one of those things?
-Of course.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.783
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you haven't.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.249
You know. Not everybody's seen
a massage table.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.114
You think I've never
had a massage?

15:23.322 --> 15:26.758
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you.
I don't get it.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.122
George, frankly, I'm getting
a little tired of hearing about her.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.456
I wanna know what I did
to this woman.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.460
You got a little thing for her?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.999
No, no. She's going out
with a friend of mine.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.637
It's only courteous
to try and like each other.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.569
What's the difference?
Who cares if she doesn't like you.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.835
Does everybody in the world
have to like you?

15:46.078 --> 15:50.447
Yes. Yes. Everybody has to like me.
I must be liked.

15:53.085 --> 15:57.419
Of course I support your decision
to change your name.

15:57.990 --> 16:03.326
After the Giant game, I realized
that this problem isn't going away.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.529
Well, listen,
I just want you to know...

16:05.731 --> 16:09.132
...that I was more than willing
to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.997
Sure.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.474
-Okay, you got your list?
-Yeah, yeah. Ten names.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.042
-Great.
-Okay, and if somebody objects...

16:19.244 --> 16:20.711
...you can just veto it.
-Okay.

16:20.879 --> 16:24.042
Okay, you start.
What's your first choice?

16:24.683 --> 16:26.810
-Stuart.
-No. Second choice.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.477
Stuart's no good?

16:30.055 --> 16:33.491
I have never met a normal guy
named Stuart.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.553
Okay. My second choice is Todd.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.528
Todd.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.461
No. Veto.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.364
All right.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.337
Hey, I think you're gonna like
my third choice.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.634
-Oh, great.
-Alex.

16:52.311 --> 16:56.407
I gotta tell you, I have
a bad association with the name Alex.

16:56.715 --> 17:01.049
-Bad association?
-In college, I sat next to an Alex...

17:01.220 --> 17:03.347
...in art history.
He always drank coffee...

17:03.522 --> 17:06.012
...and after every sip, he would go:

17:08.560 --> 17:11.028
I mean, every two seconds:

17:11.195 --> 17:14.290
And he would take, like, 40 sips,
and after every one:

17:15.434 --> 17:17.196
I had to drop the class.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.763
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.271
I was running late,
and I didn't have a chance...

17:24.443 --> 17:26.502
...to drop off my stuff
before I came over.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.542
Oh, no problem. That's fine.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.113
What's with this music?

17:31.316 --> 17:33.841
It's New Age music.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.214
Sounds of the forest.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.855
I find it soothing.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.726
Look at this. What do you know?
A massage table.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.618
This is great.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.594
-What are you doing?
-Just checking it out.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.132
Look at how this thing is made.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.771
Can I tell you something?
That's a hell of a piece of equipment.

17:53.972 --> 17:59.535
-Actually, I should get a new one.
-Nonsense. This one's fine.

17:59.878 --> 18:03.541
-So where do you wanna go?
-Go? Why go anywhere?

18:04.983 --> 18:07.110
That feels good.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.153
Yeah, that's...

18:10.355 --> 18:12.585
That's good.

18:18.130 --> 18:22.328
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.561
No. No, this isn't good.
I can't do this.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.398
Why? What's wrong?

18:27.573 --> 18:30.064
-I can't.
-No. Yes, you can.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.472
-No, I can't.
-Yes. Come on, I know...

18:32.644 --> 18:34.134
...it's something you wanna do.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.283
You know what?

18:42.654 --> 18:44.121
I should go talk to her.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.352
Nothing confrontational.
Just two adults sitting down...

18:47.526 --> 18:48.959
...trying to clear the air.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.785
I know if I could spend
some time alone with her...

18:52.431 --> 18:54.695
-I've got to. I've got to.
-You're going now?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.629
Well, I think I can still catch her.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.666
All right, George, I have had
just about enough of this.

18:59.905 --> 19:03.170
-What are you talking about?
-I am talking about you and Jodi.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.310
You're completely
obsessed with her.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.435
I know. I know.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.975
Who is more important to you,
her or me?

19:11.150 --> 19:14.608
I like you, she doesn't.
Who you gonna pick?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.320
I'm sorry, Karen. I care for you...

19:22.494 --> 19:24.928
...but I can't stand
when someone doesn't like me.

19:25.130 --> 19:29.191
-Well, now I hate you!
-That, I'm used to.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.563
-Ned?
-What is wrong with Ned?

19:34.039 --> 19:39.067
Ned's a guy who buys
irregular underwear. Next.

19:41.079 --> 19:44.674
-Ellis.
-Ellis? You might as well go with Alex.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.752
-It's the same thing.
-Ellis and Alex aren't even close.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.251
-Next!
-Oh, what's the point?

19:51.456 --> 19:55.483
-Now, no, come on!
-Okay. Okay.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.889
Remy.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.424
Remy Rifkin?

20:02.601 --> 20:05.263
Should I get a beret?

20:05.837 --> 20:08.032
Oh, Stuart's a lot better.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.007
Little Stuart Rifkin
likes to go shopping with his mother.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.904
What do you mean, no?

20:17.115 --> 20:18.707
No means no.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.010
Who you kidding?
You come to my apartment...

20:21.186 --> 20:25.589
...with your table and your little oils.
I'm not supposed to expect anything?

20:25.991 --> 20:28.016
You're a massage teaser.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.696
Listen, I massage who I want
when I want.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.992
I don't submit to forcible massage.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.739
-I'm getting out of here.
-Fine, go.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.610
Jerry, could you excuse us
for a few minutes, please?

20:56.788 --> 20:59.450
-What for?
-We need to talk.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.923
-You need to talk?
-We have nothing to talk about.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.823
Look, it's no secret
what's going on between us.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.058
She doesn't like me.
Now, Jerry, if you don't mind...

21:08.233 --> 21:12.226
George, anything you have to say
to her, you can say in front of me.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.765
Jerry...

21:17.943 --> 21:21.003
...this woman hates me so much...

21:21.179 --> 21:23.613
...I'm starting to like her.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.852
-What?
-She just dislikes me so much...

21:28.553 --> 21:31.249
...it's irresistible.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.789
-I can see that.
-I'm getting out of here.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.252
-Don't call me.
-Don't worry.

21:39.865 --> 21:44.097
A woman that hates me this much
comes along once in a lifetime.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.663
You're a lucky guy.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.702
I gotta go after her.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.308
George.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.136
I wouldn't push for the massage.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.979
Jodi!

22:07.292 --> 22:11.058
Swedes are big massagers. They like
Swedish meatballs, Swedish massage.

22:11.229 --> 22:14.164
They like having meat in their hands,
these people.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.563
But it's weird.
They have a high suicide rate.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.726
They're always rubbing
each other's necks.

22:18.904 --> 22:21.168
For a neutral country,
they seem kind of tense.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.506
I don't like the idea of
a professional massage.

22:24.710 --> 22:28.237
I don't want people touching me
that don't wanna have sex with me.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.177
You get me all loosened up,
juices flowing, then:

22:31.350 --> 22:34.615
"That's it. Okay, you're done."

22:34.820 --> 22:36.981
Like having chocolate
rubbed over your face.

22:37.155 --> 22:41.387
You wanna go, "Excuse me.
I think you missed a spot."
