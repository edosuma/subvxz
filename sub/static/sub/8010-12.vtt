WEBVTT

00:02.095 --> 00:03.727
- Aw, thanks for the bagels, Dad.
- Sure.

00:03.729 --> 00:05.529
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, I'll cover the bagels.

00:05.531 --> 00:08.064
As long as you help me
restore my dignity.

00:08.067 --> 00:09.400
Ooh, feels like a patented

00:09.402 --> 00:11.135
embarrassing Marv story coming on.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.837
Love these. Can't get enough.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.106
Yeah, so I'm leaving the bagel place,

00:15.108 --> 00:19.043
and this beautiful woman
smiles and walks up to me.

00:19.045 --> 00:20.277
Hi.

00:20.279 --> 00:22.079
Oh, hello.

00:22.081 --> 00:23.347
Can I ask you a question?

00:23.349 --> 00:24.849
I knew right then that

00:24.851 --> 00:26.417
I had to ask this woman out.

00:26.419 --> 00:28.919
Only if I can ask you a question after.

00:28.921 --> 00:30.955
Has anyone ever told you
you look like Steve Thompkins?

00:30.957 --> 00:32.423
Is he a movie star?

00:32.424 --> 00:34.658
- He's my dad.
- Ah.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.961
He passed away recently.

00:36.963 --> 00:40.097
Sorry, I can't even
look at you without...

00:41.467 --> 00:43.200
I'm sorry.

00:43.202 --> 00:44.935
What was your question?

00:44.937 --> 00:47.838
I was gonna ask if you wanted
to have a drink sometime.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.174
Excuse me?

00:50.176 --> 00:52.810
If you wanted to...

00:52.812 --> 00:55.946
have a drink sometime with me?

00:55.948 --> 00:57.681
After I just told you

00:57.683 --> 01:00.851
you remind me of my dead father?

01:00.853 --> 01:02.520
Yeah, I was...

01:02.522 --> 01:04.120
wondering if you,

01:04.123 --> 01:06.157
if you-you-you would.

01:06.159 --> 01:08.492
Hey-o!

01:08.494 --> 01:09.827
How long did this go on?

01:09.829 --> 01:10.861
Until the slap.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.363
From the bagel guy.

01:12.365 --> 01:13.631
I was in a loop. I couldn't get out.

01:13.633 --> 01:16.634
Oh, God, she made me feel so old.

01:16.636 --> 01:19.336
Interesting takeaway that
you're the victim in this story.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.640
Hmm?

01:23.985 --> 01:25.108
Hi.

01:25.269 --> 01:26.409
I'm selling candy bars for

01:26.410 --> 01:28.179
my high school football team.
Would you like to buy one?

01:28.181 --> 01:29.613
I haven't seen a high-schooler this old

01:29.615 --> 01:31.415
since 90210 went off the air.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.950
Yeah, we're trying to raise
money so our football team...

01:32.952 --> 01:34.985
can rent a bus to the playoffs.

01:34.987 --> 01:36.453
Yeah, do you have some
sort of school I.D. or...?

01:36.455 --> 01:38.656
No, it was stolen out of my locker.

01:38.658 --> 01:40.391
Out of your locker, yeah.
I'm really sorry to hear that,

01:40.393 --> 01:41.959
but I'm not gonna be able
to help you out today.

01:41.961 --> 01:43.394
- I'll take three.
- Of course you will.

01:43.396 --> 01:44.428
Here you go, yeah.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.896
And if you need any help

01:45.898 --> 01:47.131
getting a new I.D., let me know.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.499
I can hook you up.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.501
Okay, babe.

01:50.503 --> 01:52.703
You know that guy
was scamming us, right?

01:52.705 --> 01:54.738
What number was he running... magazines?

01:54.740 --> 01:57.374
- Wrapping paper? Solar panels?
- No.

01:57.376 --> 01:59.743
Just some kid old enough
to have mortgage

01:59.745 --> 02:00.978
selling chocolate bars.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.179
Why not believe him, huh?

02:02.181 --> 02:04.081
Worst case scenario... a needy kid

02:04.083 --> 02:06.083
gets a few extra bucks

02:06.085 --> 02:08.985
and we get to taste
some delicious chocolate.

02:08.988 --> 02:10.454
That...

02:10.455 --> 02:13.857
that has turned.

02:13.859 --> 02:15.926
All right, thanks for the fuel, Dad.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.261
I have that Russian billionaire's

02:17.263 --> 02:19.029
- open house to get to.
- Oh, is it

02:19.031 --> 02:21.165
that gaudy mansion that's
been on the market for months?

02:21.167 --> 02:22.633
No one serious even comes in anymore.

02:22.635 --> 02:24.702
It's just me and a taxidermy wolf

02:24.704 --> 02:27.840
that is just creepy enough
to keep me from taking a nap.

02:27.986 --> 02:28.897
Oh, I got to go, too!

02:28.899 --> 02:30.207
I got to pick up my dress
for Kelly's wedding.

02:30.209 --> 02:31.875
Oh, my gosh, that sounds
like so much fun.

02:31.877 --> 02:32.977
Can I go with you, please, please,

02:32.979 --> 02:33.944
please, please, please?

02:33.946 --> 02:35.246
That was so boring!

02:35.248 --> 02:36.947
Why did you make me come?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.282
Everybody was so snooty.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.917
âMa'am, that's not a garbage can.

02:39.919 --> 02:41.151
Ma'am, please stop trying

02:41.153 --> 02:42.519
to guess the weight of the brides.

02:42.521 --> 02:43.721
Ma'am, that is my lunch!â

02:43.723 --> 02:44.822
Oh!

02:44.824 --> 02:46.390
- Gorgeous.
- Mm.

02:46.392 --> 02:47.958
Let's hit the water
before we go back, huh?

02:47.960 --> 02:48.959
It's the least you could do.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.194
No, thanks.

02:50.196 --> 02:51.996
Oh, come on, when was the last time

02:51.998 --> 02:53.597
you rolled up your pant legs
and dipped your little piggies?

02:53.599 --> 02:55.232
Well, who's gonna watch my stuff?

02:55.234 --> 02:56.800
How about your guardian angel

02:56.802 --> 02:58.302
guards it, you goof?

02:58.304 --> 02:59.336
Hit it!

02:59.338 --> 03:00.971
All right.

03:02.775 --> 03:04.441
Hey...

03:09.315 --> 03:12.549
Ah, the ocean.

03:12.551 --> 03:14.418
You know, I can drink salt water.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.553
It makes me super sick, but I can do it.

03:16.555 --> 03:17.988
Hey, you're supposed
to be watching my stuff.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.256
I am!

03:19.258 --> 03:20.491
It's right over there by your...

03:20.493 --> 03:21.792
where your purse used to be.

03:23.863 --> 03:25.129
Someone stole my purse!

03:25.131 --> 03:26.964
Hey, this may not be the time for this,

03:26.966 --> 03:28.832
but you should really
think about carrying

03:28.834 --> 03:31.201
your valuables in a vest.

03:35.741 --> 03:37.174
Gotcha!

03:37.176 --> 03:38.275
Walt!

03:38.277 --> 03:39.443
It's not what it looks like.

03:39.445 --> 03:40.577
You know you're not allowed

03:40.579 --> 03:42.046
to use Botox on yourself.

03:42.048 --> 03:44.214
Ooh, how about this
for an Instagram caption?

03:44.216 --> 03:47.951
âSad face doctor can't
face reality of old faceâ"

03:47.953 --> 03:49.353
How did you even know I was in here?

03:49.355 --> 03:50.654
Your car's in the parking lot.

03:50.656 --> 03:53.424
How about âYoda tries to undo

03:53.426 --> 03:55.159
800 years of skin damage

03:55.161 --> 03:56.827
caused by the two suns of Tatooineâ"

03:56.829 --> 03:58.829
Yeah, that, that's the winner.

04:04.103 --> 04:06.136
Hey,

04:06.138 --> 04:07.705
Clara, ah, thank God someone's here.

04:07.707 --> 04:09.139
This wolf is freaking me out.

04:09.141 --> 04:11.575
Look.

04:11.577 --> 04:13.844
It follows me with its eyes.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.380
It's a nanny cam.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.349
Oh. Oh!

04:18.351 --> 04:19.850
What's wrong?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.654
Yes, yes! Got it.

04:24.523 --> 04:26.323
♪ Just take those
old records off... ♪

04:26.325 --> 04:28.692
Aah!

04:30.696 --> 04:32.963
- Nothing.
- Here are the new flyers.

04:32.965 --> 04:34.998
Oh, and the homeowners called the office

04:35.000 --> 04:37.701
with a message for you, but
I'm not comfortable spitting

04:37.703 --> 04:40.237
in your face, so I'll just
say, âGood luck todayâ?

04:40.239 --> 04:42.373
I get it. The Russians are so mean.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.742
I think they blame me
for the Miracle on Ice.

04:44.744 --> 04:46.076
This place is huge.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.878
What do you do here by yourself all day?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.213
You must get so bored.

04:49.215 --> 04:50.180
Scared.

04:50.182 --> 04:52.516
âBoredâ?

04:52.518 --> 04:56.286
Seems a shame to let such
an awesome espresso machine

04:56.288 --> 04:57.755
- go unused.
- Yeah, but maybe

04:57.757 --> 04:59.423
we shouldn't mess with their stuff.

04:59.425 --> 05:00.891
Ah, it's just coffee.

05:00.893 --> 05:02.559
Seriously, after the way

05:02.561 --> 05:04.194
that they've treated you, I'm surprised

05:04.196 --> 05:05.496
you're not using all their cool stuff.

05:20.713 --> 05:22.012
I'm calling my dad.

05:22.014 --> 05:23.614
He has my extra set of car keys, so...

05:23.616 --> 05:25.115
Oh, shoot, his
answering machine picked up.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.550
I must've called
his house, not his cell.

05:26.552 --> 05:28.318
So, we're waiting for a man who still

05:28.320 --> 05:30.454
has an answering machine
to come rescue us?

05:30.456 --> 05:32.055
You're a guardian angel.

05:32.057 --> 05:34.425
You couldn't have used your
powers to stop the thief?

05:34.427 --> 05:36.059
Like thrown a
lightning bolt or something?

05:36.061 --> 05:37.594
No, we're not allowed
to throw lightning anymore.

05:37.596 --> 05:38.929
Zeus ruined it for everyone.

05:38.931 --> 05:40.197
He's a total tool.

05:40.199 --> 05:41.599
Hey, does everybody's guardian angel

05:41.600 --> 05:43.734
make their lives more
complicated or just mine?

05:43.736 --> 05:46.203
Oh, my goodness, I think
your next angel lesson

05:46.205 --> 05:47.571
needs to be gratitude.

05:48.674 --> 05:50.174
- What was that?
- Oh, no.

05:50.176 --> 05:52.873
I never hung up. My dad's
answering machine

05:52.874 --> 05:53.999
recorded that whole conversation.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.479
What? All the angel talk?

05:55.481 --> 05:56.680
All of the angel talk!

05:56.682 --> 05:58.649
- Oh, crap balls! Let me see...
- No!

05:58.651 --> 06:00.818
Oh, shoot! Get it! Get it!

06:02.455 --> 06:03.754
It's dead!

06:03.756 --> 06:05.255
- You killed it!
- It's dead!

06:05.257 --> 06:06.423
Oh! What are we gonna do?

06:06.425 --> 06:07.524
You have to delete that message

06:07.526 --> 06:08.859
- before he gets home!
- How?!

06:08.861 --> 06:10.928
We have no phone, no car and no money!

06:10.930 --> 06:12.095
And no underwear!

06:12.097 --> 06:13.096
How is that relevant?!

06:13.098 --> 06:14.164
I don't know!

06:14.166 --> 06:15.365
I'm stressed!

06:15.367 --> 06:16.800
I thought we were making a list

06:16.802 --> 06:18.502
of things we don't have on us!

06:18.504 --> 06:20.404
Oh... Aah!

06:31.399 --> 06:33.766
Well, silver lining...
so is your music collection.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.034
Amy, we've got to delete that message.

06:35.036 --> 06:36.603
I mean, look, my dad was pretty upset

06:36.605 --> 06:38.104
when that kid was
scamming me with chocolate bars.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.572
Imagine what he'll do when he finds out

06:39.574 --> 06:41.641
I let a guardian angel
live in my guesthouse.

06:41.643 --> 06:43.243
You don't think I understand
the stakes here?

06:43.245 --> 06:45.612
Nobody is supposed to know I'm an angel.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.647
Not only will my own brigade de-wing me

06:47.649 --> 06:50.450
and probably reassign me to Estonia,

06:50.452 --> 06:52.218
but if your government finds out,

06:52.220 --> 06:54.187
I will be captured and quarantined

06:54.189 --> 06:55.889
just like E.T.

06:55.891 --> 06:58.791
They are going to crack open my chest

06:58.793 --> 07:03.129
and discover my heart
is filled with stars!

07:03.131 --> 07:04.764
Yeah.

07:04.766 --> 07:07.300
Yeah, those are great lyrics
for your new song, yeah.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.368
Um...

07:08.370 --> 07:10.003
♪ Crack open my chest ♪

07:10.005 --> 07:11.905
- ♪ My heart is filled with stars. ♪
- Okay, come on.

07:11.907 --> 07:13.806
- Come on, we got to get to your dad's.
- Yeah, okay, let's go.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.276
Hi there.

07:16.278 --> 07:19.012
I am so sorry to interrupt,
but my friend and I

07:19.014 --> 07:20.680
are a bit stranded and we just need

07:20.682 --> 07:22.182
a little money for bus fare.

07:22.184 --> 07:23.483
It's happening, hon.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.218
Just like the guidebook said.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.686
Do you have any identification?

07:26.688 --> 07:28.821
Oh, no, unfortunately
it was stolen on the beach.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.989
- Stolen on the beach, yeah.
- Yes!

07:29.991 --> 07:31.391
Yeah, we just need a couple

07:31.393 --> 07:32.625
bucks to get across town.

07:32.627 --> 07:34.127
Oh, so you can soak that money in vodka

07:34.129 --> 07:35.562
and stick it up the dark
side of your moon?

07:35.564 --> 07:36.729
Yeah, we know what that is.

07:36.731 --> 07:38.464
It's all in the guidebook.

07:38.466 --> 07:40.500
What guidebook of L.A. do you have?

07:40.502 --> 07:42.869
Look, I know how this must all sound.

07:42.871 --> 07:43.970
How much money a year do you make

07:43.972 --> 07:45.038
in this little scam of yours?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.539
- Excuse me?
- Well, look at you.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.474
White teeth, perfect hair,

07:48.476 --> 07:51.144
sweet sun-kissed
California body that just won't...

07:51.146 --> 07:52.512
Stay focused, hon.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.713
All I'm saying is that you

07:53.715 --> 07:56.182
and your vested money pimp have chosen

07:56.184 --> 07:57.717
the wrong tourists to con today.

07:57.719 --> 07:59.519
- Tell me when to pepper spray.
- Mm-hmm, not yet.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.121
No, this is just a big misunderstanding!

08:01.122 --> 08:02.989
- We're not...
- Allison, Allison.

08:02.991 --> 08:05.024
We can either strike
preemptively or leave now, okay?

08:05.026 --> 08:07.126
I'm gonna let you decide, however,

08:07.128 --> 08:10.163
I am itching to knock the 'tude
off that little girl's face.

08:10.165 --> 08:11.564
Yep, let's go. Bye.

08:11.566 --> 08:12.632
Mm-hmm.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.067
- Have a great holiday.
- Yeah.

08:14.069 --> 08:16.135
You know, I was worried
that I wouldn't be

08:16.137 --> 08:18.638
able to top your poison oak prank, but

08:18.640 --> 08:20.106
this picture is going to look great

08:20.108 --> 08:22.108
when I put it on T-shirts.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.543
Use the photo, I don't care.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.144
Oh, come on, this is no fun

08:25.146 --> 08:27.580
if your spirit is already crushed.

08:27.582 --> 08:29.249
All right, prank war truce.

08:29.251 --> 08:31.251
Tell me what's going on.

08:31.253 --> 08:33.753
- This beautiful woman smiled at me...
- I call BS.

08:33.755 --> 08:34.886
Before I have a chance to ask her out,

08:34.889 --> 08:36.322
she told me I look like her dad.

08:36.323 --> 08:37.991
Y-You didn't still
ask her out, did you?

08:37.993 --> 08:39.558
Eight times.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.126
Okay, this can't

08:41.129 --> 08:44.497
be about some random
babe that shot you down.

08:44.499 --> 08:46.899
Otherwise, you'd always look like this.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.369
So, tell me, what-what's
really going on?

08:49.371 --> 08:51.738
I just never thought I'd have
to worry about looking older.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.406
I was already married to the person

08:53.408 --> 08:54.907
I wanted to grow old with.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.576
I can't imagine how hard
it was losing Ellen.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.945
I feel like I'm losing a piece
of her memory every day.

08:58.947 --> 09:00.380
That's tough.

09:00.382 --> 09:02.148
But Ellen wouldn't want you, you know,

09:02.150 --> 09:04.250
sitting around, not living your life.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.786
No, she'd want me to quit
whining and get back out there!

09:06.788 --> 09:08.421
So get back out there.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.089
And by the way, you do not need Botox

09:10.091 --> 09:11.424
to attract the right woman.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.293
- Thank you.
- You need a chemical peel.

09:13.295 --> 09:15.862
Worst friend ever.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.165
Good God, that was pure.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.600
170 yards.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.769
Okay, your turn.

09:28.076 --> 09:30.843
30 yards. Nice hit.

09:30.845 --> 09:32.679
Looks like that's your record
by about 25 yards.

09:32.681 --> 09:34.580
I didn't even feel like I hit it.

09:34.582 --> 09:36.015
- Okay, it's my turn again.
- Oh, okay.

09:36.017 --> 09:38.618
Hello? Uh, is this the open house?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.887
Uh, yes it is. Take a look
around, flyer's on the table,

09:40.889 --> 09:43.056
price is firm, grab some champers,

09:43.058 --> 09:44.590
and, yes, the stuffed wolf
over there is watching you.

09:44.592 --> 09:46.526
- Cool, I'm just looking.
- All right, great.

09:46.528 --> 09:48.361
If you get lost, just jump
in any of the laundry chutes.

09:48.363 --> 09:49.796
They all go to the same place.

09:49.798 --> 09:50.963
You're more relaxed

09:50.965 --> 09:52.398
than I'm used to seeing you.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.801
Not so intense. I like it.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.769
Well, at the office you've
only seen me in shark mode.

09:56.771 --> 09:58.271
Trying to land a home sale.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.872
Here I know that's impossible, so,

09:59.874 --> 10:01.174
yeah, shark mode is off.

10:01.176 --> 10:04.043
And what animal are you
when you're just being yourself?

10:04.045 --> 10:05.478
The mighty otter.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.813
Playful, fun.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.414
Half torso, half trouble.

10:10.952 --> 10:12.719
We just need to find a policeman.

10:12.721 --> 10:13.786
We can't call the police.

10:13.788 --> 10:14.921
I got priors.

10:14.923 --> 10:16.189
And currents.

10:16.191 --> 10:17.623
Possibly futures.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.158
Well, we have no phone and no money.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.159
I don't see another way.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.361
Allison, listen.

10:21.363 --> 10:23.129
I am an angel, okay?

10:23.131 --> 10:24.564
And when an angel needs money,

10:24.566 --> 10:26.833
all she has to do is clap her hands.

10:29.571 --> 10:31.671
Hey, everybody!

10:31.673 --> 10:34.941
Gather round, it's showtime!

10:37.011 --> 10:38.077
What are you doing?

10:38.079 --> 10:39.579
I'm getting us some âcasheeshâ"

10:39.581 --> 10:40.880
Help a sister out.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.915
Yeah!

10:42.917 --> 10:44.250
What, are you gonna do
magic for them or...?

10:44.252 --> 10:45.918
Well, I would love to do some magic,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.954
but, unfortunately, magicians
are very territorial,

10:47.956 --> 10:50.390
and whenever there's more than
two of us, it's a bloodbath.

10:50.392 --> 10:51.557
Or a sex party.

10:51.559 --> 10:53.860
All right, people, yeah!

10:53.862 --> 10:55.795
Boom! It's all you, kid. Huh?

10:55.797 --> 10:57.563
Do a couple
backflips. They'll love it. Me?

10:57.565 --> 10:59.332
- I can't do backflips.
- Really?

10:59.334 --> 11:00.600
Just lost a little respect.

11:00.602 --> 11:02.702
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

11:02.704 --> 11:04.604
without further ado,

11:04.606 --> 11:07.707
I give you Miss Allison!

11:08.877 --> 11:13.546
And her amazing talent... of...

11:13.548 --> 11:15.815
I know all the state capitals?

11:15.817 --> 11:17.283
You heard that, people!

11:17.285 --> 11:18.785
She knows all her

11:18.787 --> 11:21.154
state capitals! Yeah!

11:21.156 --> 11:26.225
Prepare to be transported
back to fifth grade!

11:26.227 --> 11:28.594
Uh, hmm, okay.

11:28.596 --> 11:30.263
Uh, uh, ma'am, uh, yes.

11:30.265 --> 11:31.230
Where are you from?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.565
Vermont.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.801
Did I hear Nevada?

11:34.803 --> 11:36.002
Nope.

11:36.004 --> 11:37.970
'Cause your capital is Carson City!

11:37.972 --> 11:39.572
Can I get a âwhat-whatâ?!

11:39.574 --> 11:40.606
What-what!

11:40.608 --> 11:41.941
Okay, sir, how about you?

11:41.943 --> 11:42.975
I'm also from Vermont.

11:42.977 --> 11:44.243
How is that possible?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.378
Okay, honey, you're losing 'em.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.946
- Just do your song.
- Oh, oh, okay.

11:46.948 --> 11:48.748
Um.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.018
♪ Crack open my chest ♪

11:52.020 --> 11:53.586
♪ My heart is filled with stars... ♪

11:53.588 --> 11:54.687
- Okay, let's boogie.
- What?

11:54.689 --> 11:55.655
Show's over.

11:55.657 --> 11:56.689
Let's go. Come on.

11:56.691 --> 11:57.757
Look at 'em.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.492
All butts'd up on vodka.

11:59.494 --> 12:01.027
Let's make... Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

12:01.029 --> 12:01.994
Victory!

12:01.996 --> 12:03.362
How was that a victory?

12:03.364 --> 12:05.298
Hey, angel got our cab fare.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.266
Which I will take

12:07.268 --> 12:09.435
unless you two can show
me a performer's permit.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.770
Damn it, Gerald.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.305
Is there any way you can cut us a break?

12:12.307 --> 12:14.073
For old times' sake?

12:14.075 --> 12:16.476
Sorry, Amy, I'm married now.

12:18.313 --> 12:20.746
Ugh, I cannot be further away
from my dad's house right now,

12:20.748 --> 12:22.515
and I cannot be more frustrated.

12:22.517 --> 12:23.850
No, I think you could be.

12:23.852 --> 12:25.852
Capital of Vermont is Montpelier.

12:28.022 --> 12:29.222
Damn it.

12:33.748 --> 12:35.884
Please, it's just one phone call.

12:35.886 --> 12:38.887
I will pay your whole bill
as soon as I get my money.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.289
What is wrong with people?

12:40.291 --> 12:41.690
That is the tenth person

12:41.692 --> 12:43.025
that refused to let me
use their cell phone.

12:43.027 --> 12:44.460
Eh, it sounds like everybody's got

12:44.462 --> 12:46.328
a bad case of the Allisons, huh?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.664
And they don't want to
buy your candy bars.

12:48.666 --> 12:51.634
Listen, I think it's time
to try a little angel trick

12:51.636 --> 12:54.503
that I like to call âchilling out.

12:54.505 --> 12:56.338
Letting the universe do its thingâ"

12:56.340 --> 12:57.806
Come on, universe.

12:57.808 --> 12:58.807
Do your thing.

12:58.809 --> 13:00.242
The universe?

13:00.244 --> 13:02.244
Amy, we do not have time
for your angel nonsense.

13:02.246 --> 13:03.646
We have...

13:06.684 --> 13:09.084
Hey, oh, look who it is!

13:09.086 --> 13:12.054
Well, it's my old pal School Bus.

13:12.056 --> 13:14.256
Of all the people in the universe.

13:14.258 --> 13:16.725
Amy Cass, to what
do we owe the pleasure?

13:16.727 --> 13:18.193
Hey, pal, we're in
need of your services.

13:18.195 --> 13:19.461
Any way you can give us
a ride to Larchmont?

13:19.463 --> 13:21.864
Ooh, that's pretty far out of the way.

13:21.866 --> 13:23.499
We're going to the science museum,

13:23.501 --> 13:25.501
and the camp director
checks my odometer now

13:25.503 --> 13:27.703
thanks to last year's
Pechanga Casino incident.

13:27.705 --> 13:29.738
Hey, you think we can make
up for that lost time

13:29.740 --> 13:32.174
with a 15-minute science lesson?

13:32.176 --> 13:34.209
Okay, but make it
engaging, 'cause I'm tired of Finland

13:34.211 --> 13:35.878
kicking our asses in the earth sciences.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.246
I hear you, man,

13:37.248 --> 13:38.681
and that's where my girl
sparkles and shines.

13:38.683 --> 13:40.616
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

13:40.618 --> 13:43.018
Been at this a while, Walt.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.453
I don't feel any burning.

13:44.455 --> 13:46.455
Well, I have a very gentle touch.

13:46.457 --> 13:48.290
I'll say.

13:48.292 --> 13:52.328
Also, that is 72-hour tanning cream.

13:53.698 --> 13:55.698
You Oompa-Loompa'ed me.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.701
Payback is an orange bitch, my friend.

13:59.737 --> 14:01.437
Prank war, back on.

14:01.439 --> 14:04.306
I look like an angry yam.

14:04.308 --> 14:07.676
To industry, my dear Svetlana.

14:07.678 --> 14:11.213
Ugh, âbusiness, business.â

14:11.215 --> 14:13.882
Boris, I'm sick of it.

14:13.884 --> 14:15.818
You do not like business?

14:15.820 --> 14:18.087
Business is what pay for fur coat!

14:18.089 --> 14:21.190
Business is what pay for
Jaguar car... and jaguar pet!

14:21.192 --> 14:25.527
Is business what also give to
my sister Olga diamond necklace?

14:25.529 --> 14:26.962
Lies!

14:26.964 --> 14:28.330
I am only ever loving you.

14:28.332 --> 14:30.966
Then prove it!

14:33.003 --> 14:35.104
Oh.

14:35.106 --> 14:37.272
Wait, are we... really
doing this, or is...?

14:37.274 --> 14:38.440
Shut up and keep kissing me.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.608
Mm-hmm.

14:41.078 --> 14:44.580
And that is why osmosis is...

14:44.582 --> 14:46.982
the âawesome-mostest.â

14:46.984 --> 14:49.718
Boo! We learned that,
like, two years ago.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.520
Do you have to lose every crowd?

14:51.522 --> 14:53.389
Here, let me do this, okay?

14:53.391 --> 14:57.860
Hey, kids, did you know
that you can create gold

14:57.862 --> 15:00.662
with just six common household items?

15:00.664 --> 15:03.265
It's called alchemy, and
it's totally a real thing.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.733
Okay, don't listen to her.

15:04.735 --> 15:06.135
She's just kidding.

15:06.137 --> 15:07.536
You can't lie to kids like that.

15:07.538 --> 15:09.471
- This is science, not the tooth fairy.
- Hey.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.840
The tooth fairy is real.

15:11.842 --> 15:14.243
Sure, she has a
disgusting habit of collecting teeth,

15:14.245 --> 15:17.045
and what she's planning, no one knows,

15:17.047 --> 15:19.615
but she is legit, and so is alchemy.

15:19.617 --> 15:21.150
- Oh, cut the crap, Amy.
- Hey!

15:21.152 --> 15:22.985
I'm gonna have to ask you both to leave.

15:22.987 --> 15:24.653
You violated the first
rule of the school bus.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.088
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.289
It will not happen again.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.357
We're almost to my dad's.

15:28.359 --> 15:30.726
Are you chewing gum?!

15:30.728 --> 15:33.796
But the kid in the back
of the bus gave it to me.

15:34.732 --> 15:36.498
Now.

15:38.335 --> 15:39.835
You're better than this, Allison.

15:39.837 --> 15:41.637
You're better than this.

15:47.011 --> 15:48.743
You know what's so
frustrating about this whole thing is that

15:48.745 --> 15:49.978
if you and all these cars weren't here,

15:49.980 --> 15:51.179
I could run, like, on hyper speed

15:51.181 --> 15:53.047
and totally get there in time.

15:53.049 --> 15:55.383
I don't think you'd make it
past the first DUI checkpoint.

15:55.385 --> 15:57.285
Hey, why do you find it so
hard to believe I am who I am?

15:57.287 --> 16:00.600
- 'Cause there's zero proof.
- Zero? What are you talking about?

16:00.602 --> 16:01.266
Are you kidding?

16:01.268 --> 16:02.557
Why, just today I angeled
us up that money.

16:02.559 --> 16:04.092
I got us a bus ride.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.627
I got you to dip your toes in the ocean,

16:05.629 --> 16:07.595
which was a very satisfying experience

16:07.597 --> 16:09.998
- until your possessions were stolen.
- See, it seems to me

16:10.000 --> 16:14.068
your âangelingâ is just cons,
delusions and dumb luck.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.903
Wow, well, that cut straight
to my star-filled heart.

16:15.905 --> 16:17.572
Look, you want me to believe,

16:17.574 --> 16:18.973
do a miracle.

16:18.975 --> 16:20.875
Fly. Glow. Save a life.

16:20.877 --> 16:22.610
Make the Cubs win the World Series.

16:22.612 --> 16:25.113
Oh, honey, no angel can
undo a billy goat's curse.

16:25.115 --> 16:26.381
That's convenient.

16:26.383 --> 16:28.349
Listen, I am not allowed to use miracles

16:28.351 --> 16:30.789
to prove that I'm an angel, okay?

16:30.790 --> 16:32.371
You either believe or you don't.

16:32.373 --> 16:33.973
And judging by the number

16:33.975 --> 16:36.375
of eye rolls I counted
today... 14... you don't.

16:36.377 --> 16:38.477
15.

16:38.479 --> 16:39.945
- Whoa!
- Hey!

16:39.947 --> 16:42.114
You're the guy that was
selling us chocolate bars.

16:42.116 --> 16:43.616
So you really are on the football team?

16:43.618 --> 16:45.084
Yeah.

16:45.086 --> 16:46.385
I know, it must have been
a little confusing

16:46.387 --> 16:48.454
when I said, âI'm on
the football team.â

16:48.456 --> 16:50.122
But what are you two doing around here?

16:50.124 --> 16:51.557
Yeah, well, we kind of lost our ride.

16:51.559 --> 16:54.226
This one, chewing gum on the bus.

16:54.228 --> 16:55.494
Well, look, if it'll help you guys out,

16:55.496 --> 16:56.529
- Ooh.
- You can borrow my bike.

16:56.531 --> 16:58.230
Seriously? You would do that?

16:58.232 --> 16:59.632
Well, I would for her.

16:59.634 --> 17:01.400
- She bought three candy bars.
- Aw...

17:01.402 --> 17:03.002
Thanks so much. Listen, why don't you

17:03.004 --> 17:04.837
swing by the house later,
pick up your pedal-hog,

17:04.839 --> 17:07.406
and my girl here will buy
out your entire inventory.

17:07.407 --> 17:09.008
All right, big stuff.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.844
Well, I hope that you appreciate

17:11.846 --> 17:14.346
how much trouble I can
get into for this miracle.

17:14.348 --> 17:15.748
On, don't even try to
claim credit for this.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.148
Now, I can't see you,

17:17.151 --> 17:18.483
but I'm assuming that was eye roll

17:18.486 --> 17:20.019
- number 16.
- Hmm.

17:20.021 --> 17:21.720
Hold on.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.829
I got to say,

17:29.831 --> 17:31.730
I like Otter Brad more than Shark Brad.

17:31.732 --> 17:33.599
Yeah? Wait till you meet
Honey Badger Brad.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.667
He don't give...

17:34.669 --> 17:36.535
You're still here?

17:36.537 --> 17:38.471
- I'm gonna take it.
- What?

17:38.473 --> 17:40.372
Yeah, I want to buy the whole thing.

17:40.374 --> 17:41.807
It's hilarious.

17:41.809 --> 17:44.210
W... you do realize it's $23 million?

17:44.212 --> 17:46.212
That's fine. My start-up
just went public.

17:46.214 --> 17:48.814
Can I have my money manager
put in an offer?

17:48.816 --> 17:50.850
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.718
Oh, yeah, uh, here's my card.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.587
Yes, yes, give me a call.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.722
Cool. Thank you.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.657
Did you just sell this house?

17:58.659 --> 18:01.026
I think I did.

18:01.028 --> 18:03.129
Permission to release
Shark Brad for a moment.

18:03.131 --> 18:04.530
Permission granted.

18:04.532 --> 18:05.931
You know what, permission self-denied.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.366
I'm gonna let Otter Brad have this win.

18:07.368 --> 18:09.335
I actually don't even know

18:09.337 --> 18:10.936
what sound an otter makes.
Can we kiss again?

18:10.938 --> 18:12.004
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

18:20.181 --> 18:22.615
I don't see him. I
think we beat him home.

18:22.617 --> 18:24.416
All right, where's
the answering machine?

18:24.418 --> 18:25.444
Allison, is that you?

18:25.469 --> 18:26.709
- I need to talk to you.
- Damn.

18:27.321 --> 18:28.654
Oh, my God.

18:28.656 --> 18:29.722
That answers my first question,

18:29.724 --> 18:30.789
âIs it noticeable?â

18:30.791 --> 18:32.258
Oh, not at all.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.759
You look gr-reat!

18:33.761 --> 18:36.128
Oh, God. Do you know how to fix this?

18:36.130 --> 18:39.165
Find a sandbox and ostrich
it for six months?

18:39.167 --> 18:42.134
Oh, God, it's getting worse.

18:43.371 --> 18:44.870
All messages erased.

18:44.872 --> 18:46.038
- What? No.
- Oh.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.006
Oops, my hand must have slipped.

18:47.008 --> 18:48.374
What's wrong?

18:48.376 --> 18:51.510
I was saving a message from your mom.

18:51.512 --> 18:52.478
Oh, no.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.913
Oh...

18:53.915 --> 18:55.214
- Is this okay?
- No.

18:55.216 --> 18:56.315
No.

18:56.317 --> 18:57.650
What did it say?

18:57.652 --> 18:59.685
Oh, it was... it
was just a little message

18:59.687 --> 19:01.320
about her picking up dinner.

19:01.322 --> 19:03.289
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.725
It's probably a sign
that I should get out there,

19:06.727 --> 19:11.197
move on and let it go,
and it's okay, really.

19:11.199 --> 19:13.566
Okay, I'm gonna...

19:13.568 --> 19:16.202
go put bleach on my face.

19:16.204 --> 19:17.336
Ah, you're a trooper, Marv.

19:17.338 --> 19:18.337
Get out of my house.

19:18.339 --> 19:19.338
Okay.

19:19.340 --> 19:21.273
Oh, this is hilarious.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.375
I just found 60 bucks in my pocket.

19:23.377 --> 19:24.376
What?!

19:24.378 --> 19:26.178
Unbelievable.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.948
I'm telling you, these vests
are great for holding valuables.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.050
Sure, that money might have
saved us a little time,

19:31.052 --> 19:32.451
but, hey, we did it.

19:32.453 --> 19:34.220
Your dad doesn't think you're crazy.

19:34.222 --> 19:36.622
I'm not gonna get
locked up with Bigfoot.

19:36.624 --> 19:37.923
How do you want to celebrate?

19:37.925 --> 19:38.857
Celebrate?!

19:38.859 --> 19:40.459
Are you kidding me?!

19:40.461 --> 19:41.493
What's wrong?

19:41.495 --> 19:43.896
You! You are what's wrong.

19:43.898 --> 19:46.332
None of this would have
happened today if you were not around.

19:46.334 --> 19:47.700
I wouldn't have lost my purse,

19:47.702 --> 19:49.535
I wouldn't have made that phone call,

19:49.537 --> 19:52.438
and I wouldn't have just deleted
my mom's last message.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.641
Well, honey, sometimes angels
work in mysterious ways.

19:55.643 --> 19:58.043
Stop! You are not an angel.

19:58.045 --> 19:59.478
And you will never do anything

19:59.480 --> 20:01.580
to make me believe that you're an angel.

20:02.817 --> 20:04.416
Look out! Bus!

20:12.237 --> 20:15.128
