00:23.520 --> 00:26.318
(siren wailing in distance)

00:34.660 --> 00:37.458
(siren wailing fades)

00:50.280 --> 00:52.111
(gaSPS)
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

00:52.150 --> 00:54.118
SORRY. WRONG HOUSE.
(exhales)

00:54.150 --> 00:55.640
YOU? YOU'RE THE COP.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.458
IT WAS JUST MY MISTAKE.
NO, NO, NO. (stammers)

00:59.490 --> 01:01.685
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ARRESTED ME.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.689
YOU HUMILIATED ME AT WORK,
MADE ALL THOSE SICK ACCUSATIONS.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.221
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:07.260 --> 01:09.524
WHAT'S DOWN THERE, FORD?
DOWN WHERE?

01:09.570 --> 01:10.867
YOU GOT A LITTLE PLAYROOM
DOWN THERE,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.436
SOME TOYS, MAYBE,
AND SOME VIDEOGAMES?

01:12.470 --> 01:14.199
I MEAN, KIDS CAN'T SAY NO
TO VIDEOGAMES, AM I RIGHT?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.401
YOU PEOPLE, YOU JUST
WON'T LET THIS GO!

01:16.440 --> 01:18.362
YEAH, WELL, THAT TENDS TO BE
OUR POLICY WITH PEDOPHILES.

01:18.410 --> 01:21.470
OKAY.
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.774
I WANT YOU
OFF MY PROPERTY NOW!

01:23.810 --> 01:25.539
NOWl
(dog whirnpers)

01:25.580 --> 01:27.639
WE'RE NOT DONE.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.715
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.513
I'LL BE CALLING
YOUR SUPERVISOR.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.552
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME.
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT!

01:32.590 --> 01:34.114
YOU'LL BE FIRED!
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

01:34.160 --> 01:35.718
YOUR CAREER IS OVER!

01:35.760 --> 01:38.581
("White Doves" by Young Empires
playing)

01:38.630 --> 01:41.656
(sirens wailing)

01:41.700 --> 01:43.588
(man) * IT TAKES
A THOUSAND MILES *

01:43.630 --> 01:48.090
* TO REACH THE STARS
TONIGHT *

01:49.540 --> 01:51.804
* AND YOU WILL FIND

01:51.840 --> 01:53.774
* YOUR DREAMS,
THEY COME ALIVE *

01:53.810 --> 01:56.608
HI.
(groans)

01:56.650 --> 01:57.878
COME ON. GET UP.
NO.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.640
YES, IT'S 8:00.
NO, NO.
YOU HAVE TO GO AWAY.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.285
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR HORRIBLE... TALKING--

02:03.320 --> 02:05.185
TALKING MOUTH AWAY FROM ME.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.858
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
(water trickles)

02:06.890 --> 02:08.255
OHH!

02:08.290 --> 02:09.780
(laughs)
(laughs)

02:09.830 --> 02:12.924
(groans)
WHEN DID YOU GET IN
LAST NIGHT, ANWVAY?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.791
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

02:14.830 --> 02:17.799
OH, I REMEMBER QUITE VIVIDLY.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.661
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT TIME IT WAS.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.793
2:30 OR... 3:00.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.364
OPERATION WENT A LITTLE LATE.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.366
MM-HMM.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.900
* IN THE SUN
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG *

02:26.940 --> 02:29.249
* YOU FIND A WAY

02:29.280 --> 02:30.838
WHAT?

02:30.880 --> 02:32.416
* BACK HOME

02:32.450 --> 02:34.645
IT'S NOTHING.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.489
THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.249
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:38.290 --> 02:41.453
WELL, WE WERE FRIENDS,
AND NOW WE'RE... THIS.

02:41.490 --> 02:44.926
NOT THAT I'M EXACTLY SURE
WHAT THIS IS.
MM-HMM.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.793
WHICH IS FINE, BECAUSE...

02:47.830 --> 02:50.424
WHATEVER THIS IS,

02:50.470 --> 02:51.789
I DON'T...

02:51.830 --> 02:53.934
TOTALLY HATE IT.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.359
(laughs) ME, NEITHER.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.402
SO LET'S JUST KEEP OPEN
WITH EACH OTHER.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.500
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT
AS WE GO ALONG.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.949
SOUND GOOD?
YEAH.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.574
(sets brush down)
SOUNDS PERFECT.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.317
(laughs)

03:11.350 --> 03:12.385
(chuckles)

03:12.420 --> 03:14.308
(yawning)
IS IT REALLY THAT HARD?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.921
THE OPERATION YOU GUYS
ARE ON?
LONG. JUST LONG.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.259
IT WAS THREE ALL-NIGHTERS
IN A ROW.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.758
HEY, ARE MY EYES AS SLITTY
AS YOURS?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.267
SLITTIER.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.790
I'D TAKE YOUR PLACE
IF I COULD.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.660
FRANK'S GOT ME ON DESK DETAIL.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.769
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING.
I'M JUST GLAD TO BE BACK.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.301
YOU--YOU SEEM TO BE
ADJUSTING QUITE WELL.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.932
YOU KNOW, I REALLY AM.
(chuckles)

03:35.980 --> 03:38.278
I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DIDN'T SUCK.

03:38.310 --> 03:40.574
IT DID. BUT BEING BACK HERE,
IN THIS PLACE,

03:40.620 --> 03:42.941
WITH YOU GUYS--
IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT I HAD.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.810
AND I LOVED WHAT I HAD.
I MEAN, I'M YOUNG.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.889
I'M SINGLE. I UNDERSTAND
THIS LIFE, YOU KNOW?

03:48.920 --> 03:52.390
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.
SEE? COTTAGE CHEESE.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.022
(opens lid)
RIGHT WHERE
THE COTTAGE CHEESE SHOULD BE.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.267
YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY FROM
BEFORE YOU LEFT. I WOULDN'T...

03:56.300 --> 03:57.619
OOH.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.023
I MEAN, I SPENT
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

03:59.070 --> 04:00.389
LIVING FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.793
I'M GONNA START LIVING
FOR MYSELF AGAIN.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.967
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
IT'S FRIDAY.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.637
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

04:05.670 --> 04:06.773
YEAH.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.368
TOTALLY.
(whispers) NO.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.809
(whispers indistinctly)
OH, I CAN MAKE
THOSE COCKTAILS

04:09.850 --> 04:11.670
WE FOUND ON THAT RUSSIAN
WEB SITE. REMEMBER THOSE?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.814
UH, THE ONES THAT HAD
THE--THE--THE MEAT IN THEM?

04:13.850 --> 04:15.613
YEAH!
THOSE WERE AWFUL.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.948
I KNOW! IT'LL BE AWESOME.
OKAY? JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.888
(sets container down)

04:18.920 --> 04:20.649
(whispering) I DON'T WANT
A PARTY TONIGHT!

04:20.690 --> 04:21.679
(lowered voice)
NEITHER DO I,

04:21.720 --> 04:22.880
BUT CHRIS IS GOING THROUGH
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.558
AND HE NEEDS US, SO WE'RE
GONNA BE THERE FOR HIM, OKAY?

04:25.590 --> 04:26.659
(truck horn honks)

04:26.700 --> 04:28.622
(Frank) ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.662
LISTEN UP. LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.
(indistinct conversations fade)

04:30.700 --> 04:32.634
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
TODAY'S THE LAST DAY

04:32.670 --> 04:34.331
OF OPERATION DRIFI'NET.
(yawns)

04:34.370 --> 04:35.496
(whirring in background)

04:35.540 --> 04:37.963
SWAREK, YOUR, UH, YOUR TEAM
LOOKS A LITTLE WORN DOWN.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.807
YOU WORKING THEM TOO HARD?
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.946
GOOD, BECAUSE DRIFTNET
IS IMPORTANT TO THIS DIVISION.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.642
WHO CAN TELL ME WHY? DIAZ?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.375
TO... GET OUR NUMBERS UP?

04:47.420 --> 04:49.388
TO CLEAN UP OUR STREETS.
EXACTLY RIGHT.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.308
YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.749
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S HOW THEY
DO IT IN TIMMINS,

04:52.790 --> 04:54.553
BUT YOU'RE BACK
IN THE BIG CITY NOW.
(man chuckles)

04:54.590 --> 04:56.319
IT'S NOT A GAME.
WE'RE NOT KEEPING SCORE.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.622
WHERE ARE YOU SET UP TODAY?

04:57.660 --> 04:59.548
A HIGH-RISE AT SHERBOURNE
AND GERRARD.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.420
DRUG DEALER BY THE NAME
OF LOU CONLON.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.690
OKAY, PATROLS,
STAY CLEAR OF THIS AREA.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.061
LET THESE GUYS WORK.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.567
ALL RIGHT? WE GOT IT?
(officers) YEAH.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.760
GOOD. LET'S GO.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.960
(indistinct conversations)

05:09.000 --> 05:11.935
(groaning and murmuring)

05:11.970 --> 05:13.335
OKAY, SO WHAT IS
THE SCORE, ANWVAY?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.439
UM... FOUR TRAFFICKING,

05:15.480 --> 05:18.108
NINE CONSPIRACY TO TRAFFIC,
AND SIXTY...

05:18.150 --> 05:19.674
62 POSSESSION.
...TWO POSSESSION.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.415
OOH!
THREE PAROLE VIOLATIONS,

05:21.450 --> 05:22.815
A COUPLE OF WEAPONS CHARGES.

05:22.850 --> 05:24.545
BUT IF TODAY GOES WELL,
WE'RE GONNA BEAT

05:24.590 --> 05:27.081
THE SINGLENygIEIEK RECORD.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.088
WHERE'S CRUZ?
SHE'S NOT ON TODAY,
IS SHE?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.678
WELL, ACCORDING TO
THE SCHEDULE, SHE IS.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.721
OH. YEAH, NO, I-I, UH,
I'VE BEEN SO BURIED,

05:32.760 --> 05:35.422
I-I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER
IN A COUPLE DAYS.
OKAY.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.963
(dialing)
(Traci) SHOULD SOMEONE CALL,
OR SHOULD I ASK...

05:38.000 --> 05:39.831
(Oliver) NAH, JUST CALL HIM.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.838
HEY, IT'S ME.
WHERE ARE YA?

05:41.870 --> 05:43.007
CALL ME.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.701
(siren wailing in distance)

05:48.740 --> 05:49.946
(car engine starts)

05:49.980 --> 05:51.800
(bag clatters)

05:51.850 --> 05:53.909
CRUZ?
MM?

05:53.950 --> 05:56.077
WHAT'S UP?
YOU MISSED PARADE.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.417
CHECK THIS OUT.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.951
CITY RECORDS. HE HAD TWO TREES
TAKEN DOWN IN HIS BACKYARD.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.584
WHO DID?
FORD. THESE WERE
MATURE TREES, MCNALLY.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.825
BIG EVERGREENS.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
OKAY, BACK UP, MARLO.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.418
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
KEVIN FORD?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.097
THE GUY WE BROUGHT IN
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO?

06:11.130 --> 06:12.688
YEAH, KEVIN FORD
FROM THE DIAZ ABDUCT ION.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.139
YEAH, HE WAS CLEARED.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.967
YEAH, OF THE DIAZ CASE, SURE.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.558
BUT THE WHOLE REASON
WE BROUGHT HIM IN

06:17.610 --> 06:18.804
WAS HIS CONNECTION
TO THE MISSING HARTLEY BOY.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.775
AND THAT IS STILL UNSOLVED.
AND, MCNALLY, I AM TELLING YOU,

06:21.810 --> 06:24.472
I'VE LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE,
AND HE'S BAD NEWS.
OKAY.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.649
LISTEN TO THIS.
WHY DO YOU TAKE DOWN TREES?

06:26.680 --> 06:27.908
FOR THE VIEW, RIGHT?

06:27.950 --> 06:29.588
GUESS WHAT'S DIRECTLY
BEHIND HIS HOUSE.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.087
HUH?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.714
COLTON ELEMENTARY.
FROM HIS SECOND-FLOOR BEDROOM...
MM-HMM?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.853
WITHOUT THESE TREES,
HE'S GOT A CLEAR SHOT.

06:35.890 --> 06:38.085
HE'S WATCHING CHILDREN,
MCNALLY,

06:38.130 --> 06:40.098
EVERY DAY IN THAT PLAYGROUND.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.950
HMM?
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:42.000 --> 06:42.967
YEAH.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.560
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.068
I'M--I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT WIRED.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.806
I WAS OVER THERE LATE.
I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.432
WHERE? AT HIS HOUSE?

06:51.470 --> 06:54.701
I GOTTA GO IN.
WHO AM I RIDING WITH TODAY?

06:54.740 --> 06:56.037
UH, WELL, YOU'RE RIDING
A DESK.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.571
'CAUSE YOU MISSED PARADE.
THOSE ARE THE RULES.
(door closes)

06:58.610 --> 06:59.975
RIGHT.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.716
MAYBE IT'S BEST, YOU KNOW?
TAKE IT EASY TODAY?

07:02.750 --> 07:05.218
(radio chatter)

07:05.250 --> 07:08.185
(sirens wailing)

07:18.730 --> 07:20.994
IT'S BETTER THAN
YESTERDAY'S POST.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.667
AH, COME ON,
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.565
A RAT TOUCHED MY FOOT,
SWAREK.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.579
NOT IN A HOSTILE WAY.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.771
ALL RIGHT, CLEAR SHOT
OF CONLON'S BUILDING.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.175
(newspaper rustling)
I LOVE IT.

07:32.210 --> 07:34.644
TALK ME THROUGH IT.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.216
(Traci) ALL RIGHT.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.184
THAT HAS GOT TO BE
OUR RUNNER THERE

07:38.220 --> 07:39.619
SITTING ON THE LEDGE.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.629
MM-HMM.
SO I'M GONNA GUESS

07:42.660 --> 07:44.855

07:44.890 --> 07:46.824

ON THE PATH.

07:46.860 --> 07:49.226
(shutter clicking)
GOOD EYE. GO'I'I'A BE.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.228
OKAY, FOLKS, LOOKS LIKE
WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.828
(clicking continues)
YOU IN POSITION, NORTH CAR?

07:52.870 --> 07:54.792
(Traci) If you guys are ready
and reading me,

07:54.840 --> 07:56.137
let me know.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.058

NORTH CATCH-CAR IN POSITION.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.577

07:59.610 --> 08:01.578
Same deal. Let me know

08:01.610 --> 08:03.703
SOUTH CATCH-CAR IN POSITION.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.547
Okay. Stand by.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.719
OPERATION DRIFTNET,
FIFTH AND FINAL DAY.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.811
IT IS 2:23 P.M.,
AND WE ARE UNDERWAY.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.949
LOOK AT THAT.
YOU SHAVED.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.218
SO?

08:19.260 --> 08:20.750
SO WE'RE ON A STING.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.825
IT'S CASUAL ATTIRE,
LONG HOURS.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.121
BUT YOU STILL SHAVED.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.569
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.737
DOV DIDN'T SHAVE.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.169
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY,
THOUGH?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.837
BECAUSE HE HASN'T HIT PUBERTY?
(slaps arm)

08:31.870 --> 08:33.906
'CAUSE HE'S IN
A STEADY RELATIONSHIP.

08:33.940 --> 08:35.601
SAME WITH SWAREK.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.744
USUALLY GUYS IN THESE
TYPES OF SITUATIONS SHAVE

08:37.780 --> 08:39.873
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN
A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.218
WOW, LOOK AT YOU DOING A LITTLE
DETECTIVE WORK THERE, PRICE.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.241
IS IT ANDY?
NO.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.689
OKAY, THEN WHO IS IT?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.051
WELL, MAYBE I SHAVE
FOR MYSELF.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.978
DID THAT EVER
CROSS YOUR MIND?
GROSS.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.124
NARCISSIST.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.855
ANYWAY, THAT'S A SHAME,

08:52.900 --> 08:54.754
'CAUSE I ALWAYS LIKED THE IDEA
OF YOU AND ANDY.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.769
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD FIT.
WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.297
WE SHOULD PLAY POKER
SOMETIME, YOU AND ME.

09:06.010 --> 09:10.743
(radio chatter)

09:10.780 --> 09:13.340
SO, YOU GONNA BE LIKE THIS
ALL DAY, OR WHAT?

09:13.380 --> 09:16.269
LIKE WHAT?
WHAT--LIKE, IN THESE
WAVES OF HAPPINESS.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.288
IT'S--IT'S KIND OF MAKING
MY TEETH ACHE.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.878
(chuckles softly)

09:19.920 --> 09:21.888
I'M JUST IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE
RIGHT NOW.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.354
SEE, NOW THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE HAPPY PEOPLE.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.926
IT'S--"IN A GOOD PLACE."

09:25.960 --> 09:27.222
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.195
ARE YOU IN A PASTRY SHOP,
OR ARE YOU IN A HOT TUB?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.829
OH, STOP IT.
I'M REALLY VALUING
MY "ME" TIME.

09:33.870 --> 09:34.996
OHH! (shudders)

09:35.040 --> 09:36.860
(both laugh)

09:36.910 --> 09:38.263
SEE, NOW, YOU THINK
YOU'RE JOKING.

09:38.310 --> 09:39.868
YOU THINK YOU'RE JOKING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT JOKING.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.878
THOSE WORDS COME
SO EASY TO YOU.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.207
(laughs)
(radio static)

09:43.250 --> 09:45.741
(woman) 15-05, we have
a possible assault at, uh...

09:45.780 --> 09:47.008
OH.
30 Furlough Street.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.780
(siren wailing)
15-05. WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

09:49.820 --> 09:53.756
(siren approaching)

09:53.790 --> 09:54.984
(wailing stops)

09:56.690 --> 09:59.250
(panicked voice)
OVER HERE! LOOK!

09:59.290 --> 10:00.723
I JUST CAME
TO DROP OFF A PACKAGE.
(door closes)

10:00.760 --> 10:02.990
(radio chatter)

10:03.030 --> 10:04.725
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.294
YOU SEE HIM?

10:11.970 --> 10:13.107
YEAH. _

10:13.140 --> 10:15.677
UNIT 15-05. WE NEED E.M.S.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.677
IT'S OPEN.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.075
ALL RIGHT. IT'S OPEN.
OKAY, GOOD, SIR. STAY THERE.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.247
GO CHECK. GO CHECK.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.783
SIR?

10:24.820 --> 10:26.287
HE'S GOT A PULSE.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.889
MCNALLY, HE'S KEVIN FORD.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.199
(shutter Clicks)

10:42.240 --> 10:44.231
ALL RIGHT, NASH,
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.238
(shutter clicking)

10:46.270 --> 10:48.773
(clicking continues)

10:50.410 --> 10:53.675
(clicking continues)
(Traci) OKAY, LOOK ALIVE, TEAM.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.312
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
OUR FIRST CUSTOMER.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.749
(clicking continues)

10:56.790 --> 10:58.746
(Traci)
4O BUCKS, BIG SPENDER.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.054
(Swarek) HALF A GRAM.
NICE LITTLE AFTERNOON SNACK.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.887
(clicks)
WHAT FLOOR IS CONLON ON?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.420
FOURTH. HE SHOULD BE DOWN
ANY SECOND.

11:04.460 --> 11:08.794
(shutter clicking)
(speaking inaudibly)

11:08.830 --> 11:10.821
(Swarek) AND HERE HE IS, FOLKS,
THE STAR OF THE SHOW!

11:10.870 --> 11:14.033
LOU CONLON!
(clicking continues)

11:14.070 --> 11:15.799
YOU KNOW, BY MY COUNT,

11:15.840 --> 11:18.400
IF WE GET NINE BUYERS,
PLUS CONLON AND HIS CREW

11:18.440 --> 11:20.772
MAKE 12--THAT'S THE RECORD.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.072
HUH.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.907
(shutter clicking)

11:25.950 --> 11:28.077
(Swarek) AND...
(clicking continues)

11:28.120 --> 11:29.781
TRANSACTION COMPLETE.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.287
NORTH CATCH-CAR, YOU'RE UP.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.756
CAUCASIAN, 30$, 5'10".
BLACK AND TAN JACKET.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.826
(clicking continues)
PRODUCT IS
IN HIS RIGHT JACKET POCKET.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.350
(Gail) Got it.

11:38.390 --> 11:40.255
(dog barking in distance)

11:40.300 --> 11:42.393
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
FIGHT OR FLIGHT?

11:42.430 --> 11:44.921
NEITHER. THIS GUY LOOKS
LIKE A WEEPER.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.835
YOU THINK?

11:46.870 --> 11:49.168
BIG SOB STORY. BOOK IT.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.900
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

11:54.940 --> 11:56.840
(pigeons cooing,
Wings flapping)

11:59.820 --> 12:01.776
SIR, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE POSSESSION

12:01.820 --> 12:03.845
OF ILLEGAL NARCOTICS.
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.084
(handcuffs clicking)
THE CRACK COCAINE
YOU JUST BOUGHT.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.348
THE CRACK IN YOUR LEFT POCKET.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.914
NOW THIS CAN GO FAST
OR IT CAN GO SLOW.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.279
I'VE NEVER DONE CRACK
IN MY LIFE.
SLOW, THEN.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.026
HEY, LOOK, I JUST VISITED
A FRIEND BACK THERE,

12:11.060 --> 12:12.357
AND I CAN SEE HOW IT MIGHT
HAVE LOOKED LIKE A DRUG BUY,

12:12.390 --> 12:14.051
BUT I ASSURE YOU, I GOT--

12:14.100 --> 12:15.397
OKAY, YEAH, THAT IS CRACK.
I'M NOT GONNA DENY THAT.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.863
BUT HERE'S
WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.322
IT'S NOT FOR YOU?
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.395
NO, IT'S FOR HIS COUSIN.
IT IS FOR MY COUSIN,
EXACTLY.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.930
DO YOU KNONIIL/J MY COUSIN?

12:21.970 --> 12:24.200
L-LET ME GUESS. IS THIS,
UH, FOR YOUR COUSIN, TOO?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.162
LISTEN, I WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

12:26.210 --> 12:27.939
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST.
MM-HMM.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.436
HAVE EITHER OF YOU EVER
HAD KIDNEY STONES?

12:29.480 --> 12:32.506
'CAUSE I DO. BAD ONES.
ACTING UP ALL WEEK.
RIGHT.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.541
SO COMBINE THAT WITH WHAT HAS
BEEN A REALLY CRAPPY TIME

12:34.580 --> 12:36.070
FOR ME PERSONAL LIFE-WISE,

12:36.120 --> 12:37.417
AND I JUST WANT TO EASE
THE SUFFERING A BIT.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.247
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
WEEPER.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.485
I GOT TO ADMIT--IT DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE IT WAS GOING THAT WAY.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.559
TRACI, SUSPECT '5 IN CUSTODY.
CALL FOR TRANSPORT.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.091
(door closes, radio chatter)

12:47.130 --> 12:49.928
SO THE STRUGGLE STARTS HERE,
WELL INSIDE THE HOUSE.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.392
DOORS AND WINDOWS?
(camera shutter clicking)

12:51.430 --> 12:53.432
UH, FRONT DOOR'S OPEN.
ALL THE WINDOWS ARE LOCKED.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.062
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.239
THE ATTACKER WAS INVITED IN,
MAYBE KNOWN TO FORD.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.999
FIGHT BREAKS OUT,
MOVES OVER TO HERE.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.237
(sighs) FORD GOES DOWN.
NOW, FORD'S A BIG GUY.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.872
IT WOULD TAKE A LOT
TO OVERPOWER HIM.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.207
SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A LARGE MALE?

13:05.250 --> 13:06.399
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL.

13:06.450 --> 13:08.315
(shutter clicking,
radio Chatter)

13:08.350 --> 13:10.409
UH, HEAD WOUND--DID E.M.S. SAY
IF IT WAS RELATED TO THE FALL?

13:10.450 --> 13:12.213
THEY COULDN'T TELL,
BUT IT WAS PRETTY BAD.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.957
I MEAN, HE WAS STILL
UNCONSCIOUIJKVA'YEN THEY LEFT.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.356
GREAT. SO, WE KNOW
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.223
(radio chatter continues)
WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO OUT THERE,
START CANVASSING?

13:20.260 --> 13:22.228
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WILL DO.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.989
(shutter clicking)

13:24.030 --> 13:25.099
(sighs)

13:28.570 --> 13:31.505
(radio chatter)

13:31.540 --> 13:33.872
HI. I'M OFFICER MCNALLY.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.400
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD
A FEW MINUTES

13:35.440 --> 13:38.898
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
YEAH. I SAW THE COMMOTION.
IS MR. FORD ALL RIGHT?

13:38.950 --> 13:41.418
UH, ACTUALLY, HE WAS ASSAULTED.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

13:41.450 --> 13:44.010
UH, NO. HE MOSTLY
KEEPS TO HIMSELF.

13:44.050 --> 13:46.189
NOT VERY FRIENDLY,
TO BE HONEST.
OKAY.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.949
SO, YOU MUST BE HERE
ABOUT THE WOMAN.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.958
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WOMAN?

13:49.990 --> 13:52.356
UH, LAST NIGHT ABOUT 9:00,
I WAS WALKING BY.

13:52.390 --> 13:55.325
MR. FORD AND A WOMAN WERE
GOING AT EACH OTHER IN THE YARD.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.588
WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE?

13:56.630 --> 13:59.190
LONG BROWN HAIR,
ABOUT MY HEIGHT, PRETTY.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.494
AND REALLY WORKED UP
ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.132
OKAY.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.309
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.605
(radio chatter)

14:08.640 --> 14:09.629
(door closes)

14:09.680 --> 14:11.147
HEY.
HEY.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.647
ALL RIGHT, SO,
SO FAR ALL I'VE LEARNED

14:12.680 --> 14:14.875
IS THAT, UH, FORD'S NEIGHBORS
THINK HE'S KIND OF A DINK.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.287
UH, YOU GETTING ANYTHING?
UH... YEAH. I GOTTA GO,
ACTUALLY.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.412
WHAT?
I JUST HAVE TO DEAL
WITH SOMETHING.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.554
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.126
(sighs)

14:24.360 --> 14:27.193
(cell phone vibrates)

14:27.230 --> 14:29.494
(beeps)
MCNALLY, WHAT'S UP?

14:29.530 --> 14:32.294
SAM, I NEED TO TALK.
YEAH, I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE, YOU KNOW?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.888
LOOK, I THINK
MARLO'S IN TROUBLE.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.165
WHAT? WH-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.108
IT'S SERIOUS, OKAY?

14:38.140 --> 14:39.607
SHE'S AT THE STATION.
CAN YOU MEET ME THERE?

14:39.640 --> 14:41.232
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.474
CAN YOU JUST MEET ME
AT THE STATION, PLEASE?
O-OKAY.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.375
I-I'M ON MY WAY.
(beeps)

14:44.410 --> 14:46.241
(sighs)

14:46.280 --> 14:47.474
NASH...

14:47.520 --> 14:50.284
(stammers)
CAN YOU RUN THIS?
WHAT?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.538
YOU'RE OKAY HERE, ALL RIGHT?
YOU GOT THIS.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.184
I GOT THIS? THIS--
THIS IS YOUR OPERATION!

14:55.220 --> 14:56.517
AND I WOULDN'T LEAVE
IF I DIDN'T THINK

14:56.560 --> 14:58.187
YOU COULD HANDLE IT, OKAY?
JUST STICK TO THE PLAN.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.993
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.
(breathes unevenly)

15:00.030 --> 15:02.021
NASH, PLEASE.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.391
OKAY. GO.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.059
(door buzzes and beeps)
YEAH, IT'S LIKE, UH,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.203
GIN AND TONIC,
EXCEPT THE GIN IS VODKA

15:12.240 --> 15:13.571
AND THE TONIC IS ETHANOL.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.976
HEY. HAVE YOU SEEN,
UH, CRUZ?

15:16.010 --> 15:17.944
OH, YEAH, SHE'S--
UH, EVIDENCE ROOM.
OKAY.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.312
YEAH, I'M KIND OF...
MCNALLY?

15:20.350 --> 15:22.375
HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MARLO?

15:22.420 --> 15:24.285
(lowered voice)
JUST COME WITH ME. LISTEN.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.981
KEVIN FORD WAS ATTACKED
LAST NIGHT.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.510
WHAT? THE GUY WE BROUGHT IN
ON THE DIAZ CASE?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.118
INVESTIGATORS ARE
AT HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.479
SO WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH MARLO?

15:30.530 --> 15:33.090
BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE.
SHE WAS AT HIS HOUSE!

15:33.130 --> 15:38.193
(woman speaking indistinctly
on P.A.)

15:38.230 --> 15:39.595
(door closes)

15:45.210 --> 15:47.735
GLAD YOU'RE HERE. DID YOU
TELL HIM ABOUT THE TREES?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.429
NO, I DIDN'T.
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
THE START.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.742
THE MORE YOU LOOK
AT THIS THING--

15:50.780 --> 15:51.872
HIS MOVEMENTS,
HIS SPENDING PATTERNS--

15:51.910 --> 15:53.741
ALL STARTING
WITH THE HARTLEY BOY.
(rustling papers)

15:53.780 --> 15:55.213
A WITNESS SAID
THAT SHE SAW A BLOND MAN

15:55.250 --> 15:57.013
WALKING AWAY WITH A CHILD.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.211
NOW, FORD HAS BROWN HAIR,
BUT I WENT TO THAT LOCATION

15:59.250 --> 16:01.650
AT THE SAME--6:20,
THE SUN'S LOW ON THE HORIZON.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.248
MARLO--
FORD WOULD HAVE BEEN
BACKLIT.

16:03.290 --> 16:04.985
SO THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
A RIM OF LIGHT

16:05.030 --> 16:06.258
AROUND HIS HEAD.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.099
I MEAN, YOU COULD EASILY
MISTAKE HIM FOR A BLONDE.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.621
HEY, MARLO, SLOW DOWN, OKAY?
NO, NO.
DON'T DO THAT, SAM.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.490
OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW IT'S A LOT,

16:14.800 --> 16:16.290
I CAN LAY THE WHOLE THING OUT.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.137
YEAH... (muttering)

16:18.170 --> 16:20.638
(radio chatter)

16:20.680 --> 16:22.170
(lowered voice) WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.168
MCNALLY,
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.040
(lowered voice)
SHE'S BIPOLAR.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.615
SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.083
NO. I FOUND OUT BY ACCIDENT.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.384
BUT SHE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL, SO...

16:38.430 --> 16:39.579
I DIDN'T.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.524
LOOK, SEE. MARCH 7, 2010--

16:43.570 --> 16:45.765
FORD CLAIMED HE WAS
OUT OF TOWN.
(normal voice) MARLO.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.529
SEE--
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN
TO ME FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

16:47.570 --> 16:49.788
WHAT?
MARLO, YOU'RE A LITTLE
WORKED UP RIGHT NOW.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.432
OKAY? MARLO?
(panUng)

16:51.470 --> 16:53.370
YOU NEED TO STEP BACK
FROM THIS.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.729
I DO?
(Swarek) YEAH.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.179
(Marlo) I DON'T.
YEAH. CAN YOU DO THAT
FOR ME?

16:56.210 --> 16:58.098
SAM, I AM MAKING
HEADWAY HERE.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.708
I-I HEAR YOU.
I SEE THAT.
NO, THIS IS--

16:59.750 --> 17:02.674
I HAVE BEEN WORKING
REALLY HARD ON THIS.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.142
(stammers)
MARLO. ..

17:04.190 --> 17:06.511
KEVIN FORD WAS ATTACKED
LAST NIGHT.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.382
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.649
(breathing unevenly)

17:14.700 --> 17:17.328
Y-YOU DON'T THINK I HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.520
YOU WERE AT HIS HOUSE.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.696
I WAS INVESTIGATING.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.389
BUT A WITNESS SAW YOU
FIGHTING WITH HIM.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.805
HE CAUGHT ME LOOKING THROUGH
HIS SIDE DOOR.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.364
THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT,
AND THEN I LEFT.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.139
THAT WAS IT. I LEFT.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.533
COME ON.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.138
SAM, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.569
I DID NOT... DO THAT.

17:32.610 --> 17:35.579
OKAY. (chuckles)

17:35.620 --> 17:38.680
THEY'RE GONNA BE COMBING
THROUGH FORD'S LIFE RIGHT NOW.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.553
SO ARE THEY GONNA FIND ANYTHING
THAT POINTS BACK TO YOU?

17:41.590 --> 17:43.421
NO.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.722
THIS SIDE DOOR--
DID YOU TOUCH IT?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.123
MAYBE.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.725
(gasps) SAM...

17:50.770 --> 17:52.089
OKAY, OKAY. COME ON.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.269
(panﬁng)
COMEON.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.790
COME ON. SIT DOWN.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.808
ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.
SO LOOK AT ME.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.308
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS
SORTED OUT, OKAY?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.279
OKAY.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.545
(radio chatter)

18:10.590 --> 18:12.512
ALL RIGHT, SIGN HER OUT,
TAKE HER HOME.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.689
MAKE SURE NO ONE SEES HER
LIKE THIS, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.415
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:16.460 --> 18:18.257
SAM, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

18:18.290 --> 18:21.259
I DON'T KNOW.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.897
IS THERE SOMEONE
YOU CAN CALL, MARLO?

18:29.940 --> 18:32.238
SOMEONE WHO CAN BE
WITH YOU?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.204
YOU TOLD HIM.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.470
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.909
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED, MARLO?

18:40.950 --> 18:43.282
YOU--YOU HAD EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.884
I FELL IN LOVE.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.229
I JUST WANTED TO FEEL IT,
MCNALLY,

18:51.260 --> 18:53.524
YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
GETS TO.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.199
INSTEAD OF FEARING IT.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.824
TAMPING IT DOWN,
DRUGGING IT AWAY.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.601
I LOVE HIM.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.835
I JUST WANTED TO FEEL IT.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.370
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO MY PSYCHIATRIST.

19:12.410 --> 19:13.775
CAN YOU TAKE ME THERE?

19:15.220 --> 19:16.619
OF COURSE.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.185
(vehicles passing)

19:24.290 --> 19:25.655
(speaking inaudibly)

19:25.690 --> 19:27.658
(Traci) ALL RIGHT, CAUCASIAN,
20$, GREEN JACKET.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.656
SOUTH CATCH-CAR, YOU'RE UP.
(radio static)

19:29.700 --> 19:30.962
H-HOLD ON.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.262
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
Yeah.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.528
I RECOGNIZE THAT GUY.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.197
THAT'S PAUL HUSS.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.662
HE'S A SOLDIER
WITH THE DOWLING CREW.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.509
DOWLING CREW? WHAT'S HE
DOING ALL THE WAY OVER HERE?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.172
(radio static)
GOOD QUESTION.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.540
BUYING DRUGS FROM THE
COMPETITION. THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

19:46.580 --> 19:47.911
WELL, MAYBE HE HAS
AN ADDICTION.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.214
HE DOESN'T WANT HIS PEOPLE
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

19:52.550 --> 19:54.279
SUSPECT IS IN SIGHT.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.208
NASH, ADVISE.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.956
(inhales sharply)

20:00.530 --> 20:01.849
NASH?

20:04.430 --> 20:05.863
WHAT DOES SWAREK SAY?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.832
SWAREK'S OFF DEALING WITH
HIS LATEST MCNALLY CRISIS.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.929
OKAY, WELL, TRACI,
WE'RE GONNA MISS OUR MOMENT.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.335
SHOULD WE GO?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.649
OKAY, GET HIM.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.375
NO, NO, WAIT. STOP!

20:20.420 --> 20:21.773
Watch him.

20:21.820 --> 20:22.969
LET'S SEE WHERE THIS GOES.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.317
(closes door)

20:26.290 --> 20:28.918
ALL RIGHT, SUSPECT 'S
GETTING INTO A BLACK S.U.V.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.382
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A DRIVER INSIDE.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.421
(radio static)
WHERE ARE THEY HEADED?

20:32.460 --> 20:34.826
THEY'RE NOT.
THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.261
(typing, beep)

20:38.300 --> 20:40.268
AND YOU GUESSED IT.
THE VEHICLE'S ON FILE.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.528
TIES TO THE DOWLING CREW.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.266
OKAY, OKAY.
THEY MOVE, TELL ME.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.299
COPY.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.268
(siren blares)

20:51.580 --> 20:53.946
(radio chatter)
(man) HEY, YOU SPOKE TO, UH...

20:53.980 --> 20:57.279
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter continues)

21:11.100 --> 21:12.920
YEAH, WE'RE LIFTING
SOME PRINTS RIGHT NOW

21:12.970 --> 21:15.393
FROM THE BASEMENT.
WE SPOKE TO, UH...

21:15.440 --> 21:17.408
(cell phone vibrates)
WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES
OFF OF THAT.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.829
(vibrating continues, beeps)

21:19.870 --> 21:22.907
OH, COME ON, SWAREK.
SERIOUSLY.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.374
(sighs)
(buttons clicking)

21:31.450 --> 21:32.940
HI. IT'S TRACI.

21:32.990 --> 21:35.709
UM... YOU GOT A SECOND?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.387
SWAREK?

21:38.860 --> 21:40.452
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON A DRUG SWEEP.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.491
I'M, UH... FIGURED I COULD
HELP OUT HERE.

21:42.530 --> 21:44.566
I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE VICTIM, SO...

21:44.600 --> 21:46.420
SINCE WHEN DO YOU TAKE
ASSAULT CALLS?

21:46.470 --> 21:47.767
YEAH. NO CHOICE.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.688
AFTER YOU GUYS HAULED FORD IN,
HE MADE COMPLAINTS,

21:49.740 --> 21:51.367
CLAIMED HE WASN'T TREATED
VERY WELL.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.037
ALL RIGHT, WELL, DIAZ'S KID
WAS MISSING.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.709
THINGS MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
A LITI-LYEEAmlPOLITE'

21:55.740 --> 21:57.344
WELL, THE BRASS HAVE THEIR
EYES ON THIS ONE.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.348
THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT
THE WHOLE CIRCUS HERE.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.075
NO STONE UNTURNED.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.576
RIGHT.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.051
(radio chatter)

22:12.090 --> 22:14.820
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.090
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO CATCH
A PREDATOR.
I KNOW.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.963
I KNOW I CROSSED THE LINE,
AND...

22:20.000 --> 22:23.094
LOOK, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO GET INVOLVED.
IT'S OKAY.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.732
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED HIM.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.408
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN PHOTOS

22:26.440 --> 22:27.907
OR GONE INSIDE HIS HOUSE
OR DONE ANY--

22:27.940 --> 22:30.477
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU WENT INSIDE HIS HOUSE?

22:33.780 --> 22:36.669
I-I'M JUST GONNA--
I'M GON_NA RELEASE...
(radio chatter)

22:36.720 --> 22:38.017
ANYTHING INTERESTING OUTSIDE?

22:38.050 --> 22:40.416
SOME PARTIALS ON THE DOOR.
NOTHING RECOVERABLE.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.653
(radio chatter continues)

22:46.690 --> 22:49.420
(cell phone vibrating)

22:52.000 --> 22:53.490
HEY. HOW IS SHE?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.496
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S WITH
HER PSYCHIATRIST RIGHT NOW.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.100
SAM, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
SHE WENT INTO FORD'S HOUSE.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.937
WH-WH EN?

22:59.970 --> 23:01.835
TWO NIGHTS AGO. SHE WENT
THROUGH HIS COMPUTER.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.575
HOLD ON.

23:03.610 --> 23:07.046
(indistinct conversations,
camera shutter clicks)

23:07.080 --> 23:10.481
(radio chatter)

23:12.020 --> 23:14.011
BET YOU'RE GETTING LOTS
OF PRINTS OFF THAT, HUH?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.755
(chuckles) YEAH.
GO'I'I'A BE FORD'S, MOSTLY.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.623
BUT THERE'S A SECOND SET, TOO.
SMALLER. LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN'S.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.423
CLEAN?
PERFECT.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.950
WE SENT THE DIGITAL IMAGE
TO THE LAB.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.695
THEY'RE PROCESSING.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.766
HEY.
(camera shutter clicking)

23:27.130 --> 23:28.688
YOU ALL RIGHT?

23:28.740 --> 23:29.968
OH, YEAH. I GOT A...
(chuckles)

23:30.000 --> 23:31.501
I GOT A BIT OF A HEADACHE.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.898
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST HEADING
BACK TO THE STATION.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.737
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.749
(indistinct conversations)

23:42.880 --> 23:44.848
(radio chatter continues)

23:44.890 --> 23:46.141
(lowered voice) MCNALLY?
YEAH?

23:46.190 --> 23:47.714
THEY GOT MARLO'S PRINTS,
ALL RIGHT,

23:47.760 --> 23:49.113
SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY MATCH THEM.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.582
SO I NEED YOU TO LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.518
All right? I need you
to go back to the station

23:52.560 --> 23:53.891
and get Marlo's memo book.
WHY?

23:53.930 --> 23:56.125
YOU NEED TO ADD AN ENTRY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

23:56.160 --> 23:57.889
OKAY? EXPLAINING
WHY SHE WAS HERE.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.227
SAM, DON'T ASK ME TO DO THAT!

23:59.270 --> 24:01.135
LOOK, WE HAD OFFICERS
ALL THROUGH THIS PLACE

24:01.170 --> 24:02.865
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
THIS ISN'T A STRETCH.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.629
I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T
GET BACK IN TIME.

24:04.670 --> 24:05.967
CALLAGHAN'S ON HIS WAY.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.568
EVEN IF I WANTED TO GET
TO THE MEMO BOOKS,

24:07.610 --> 24:09.100
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.
THEY'RE LOCKED UP.

24:09.140 --> 24:13.679
THE COMBINATION IS IN FRANK'S
DESK DRAWER, RIGHT-HAND SIDE.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.574
McNally, once those
prints match,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.110
THIS CASE GOES RIGHT
OFF THE RAILS.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.549
NO ONE'S GONNA CARE
ABOUT FORD

24:18.590 --> 24:19.784
OR WHOEVER ATTACKED HIM.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.048
IT'S ALL GONNA BE
ABOUT MARLO.

24:21.090 --> 24:23.524
YOU'RE NOT HONESTLY TRYING TO
SELL THIS AS GOOD POLICE WORK.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.586
SHE DIDN'T DO IT. OKAY?

24:26.630 --> 24:28.723
YOU KNOW THAT.
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.660
IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER
HOW GOOD A COP SHE IS,

24:30.700 --> 24:31.928
HOW GOOD A PERSON.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.268
THIS ONE MISTAKE IS GONNA
RUIN HER LIFE.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.699
IT WILL DESTROY HER.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.967
Andy, she needs this.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.570
If you won't do it for her,

24:41.610 --> 24:43.009
do it for me.

24:50.650 --> 24:52.584
THANKS FOR COMING.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.087
I'M JUST FLATTERED YOU,
UH, THOUGHT OF ME.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.111
I CALLED A GUNS AND GANGS
DETECTIVE

24:56.160 --> 24:57.855
TO A GANG INCIDENT.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.881
WELL, I FLA'I'I'ER EASILY.
(sighs)

24:59.930 --> 25:01.625
SO RUN IT BY ME AGAIN.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.252
WHAT, A MEMBER
OF THE DOWLING CREW

25:03.300 --> 25:04.824
BOUGHT CRACK
OFF YOUR GUY HERE?

25:04.870 --> 25:06.622
THAT'S RIGHT. NOW HE'S
IN A PARKED S.U.V.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.137
DOWN THE BLOCK.
YOU WERE RIGHT TO CALL.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.195
UH, WHERE'S SWAREK?
ISN'T HE RUNNING THIS THING?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.060
UH, DON'T ASK.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.577
(Chloe) Nash, we got
something here.

25:13.610 --> 25:15.771
WE HAVE A SECOND VEHICLE
APPROACHING.

25:15.810 --> 25:18.574
(window whirring)

25:18.610 --> 25:19.770
WHOA, IT'S JACKSON IRVING.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.947
THIS IS PECK.
ARE YOU SURE?

25:20.980 --> 25:23.619
YEAH. YEAH. JACKSON IRVING,
HEAD OF THE DOWLING CREW.

25:23.650 --> 25:24.981
(camera shutter clicking)
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT
A THIRD MALE

25:25.020 --> 25:28.285
GETTING OUT OF THE S.U.V.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.959
IRVING'S GIVING HIM SOMETHING.
UH, IT'S A PAPER BAG.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.821
(lowered voice)
IT'S GUNS.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.919
UNTRACEABLE GUNS.
YEAH.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.091
AND NOW THEY'RE LEAVING.
DO WE FOLLOW?

25:40.130 --> 25:43.031
NO. STAY WITH THE_FIRST S.U.V.
(radio static)

25:43.070 --> 25:45.766
SO THEY SENT A FAKE BUYER
TO CASE CONLON'S OPERATION

25:45.810 --> 25:47.232
AND GET EYES ON HIM.
(normal v0ice)
NOW THEY HAVE THEIR ORDERS.

25:47.270 --> 25:48.635
YOU KNOW, THIS TIME,
THEY KILL.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.568
PUT THE GUYS IN PLACE,
WE STOP THAT S.U.V.

25:50.610 --> 25:52.168
NO. NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?

25:52.210 --> 25:54.678
TRACI, WE JUST TIED
JACKSON IRVING DIRECTLY TO THIS.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.676
YES, AND?
SO, YOU ROLL UP
ON THAT S.U.V. NOW,

25:56.720 --> 25:59.143
YOU GET A FEW FOOT SOLDIERS
ON MINOR GUN CHARGES.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.317
IF WE GET THEM ALL
IN THE BUILDING

26:01.360 --> 26:02.713
WITH THE GUNS IN THEIR HANDS,

26:02.760 --> 26:03.954
THAT'S CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT MURDER.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.287
IRVING GOES AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.025
BUT, STEVE, WE ARE NOT
SET UP FOR THIS.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.823
WE'RE HERE BUSTING
DIME-BAGGERS.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.761
LISTEN TO ME. JACKSON IRVING
IS A COLDBLOODED KILLER.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.031
LAST MONTH, HE PUT A HIT
ON A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.765
WE'VE BEEN AFTER THE GUY
FOREVER.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.233
WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.135
WE'RE--WE'RE NOT PREPARED
FOR THIS.

26:20.170 --> 26:21.637
NO, THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT!

26:21.680 --> 26:23.170
THIS IS A CHANCE TO GET
A MURDERER OFF THE STREET.

26:23.210 --> 26:25.303
I CAN GET BACKUP HERE
IN MINUTES.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.942
WE DO THIS SAFE,
NO ONE GETS HURT.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.947
MAKE THE CALL.

26:31.990 --> 26:35.118
(exhales)

26:35.160 --> 26:37.151
(indistinct conversations,
alert signal beeps)

26:37.190 --> 26:41.650
(woman speaking indistinctly
on P.A.)

26:41.700 --> 26:44.089
(speaking indistinctly)

27:04.120 --> 27:06.384
(door buzzes in distance)

27:09.390 --> 27:11.324
(radio chatter)

27:11.360 --> 27:13.328
(opens drawer)

27:16.260 --> 27:17.295
(closes drawer)

27:23.710 --> 27:26.167
(woman on P.A.) S.I.S. IS
ON LINE 6 FOR SERGEANT KEHOE.

27:26.210 --> 27:28.269
(door buzzes and beeps)
HEY.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.130
ANY HEADWAY
ON THE FORD CASE?

27:30.180 --> 27:32.899
NOT MUCH. I MEAN, THE GUY'S
A SUSPECT ED PEDOPHILE

27:32.950 --> 27:36.738
AND CONFIRMED JERK, SO FOR
MOTIVE, TAKE YOUR PICK.
(cell phone vibrating)

27:36.780 --> 27:39.749
(radio chatter)

27:43.160 --> 27:46.323
(copier whirring,
number pad beeping)

27:47.460 --> 27:50.918
(beeping continues)

27:55.840 --> 27:57.808
HUH.
WHAT IS IT?

27:57.840 --> 27:59.967
WE GOT A MATCH ON THE SECOND
SET OF PRINTS FOUND AT FORD'S.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.978
OFFICE MARLO CRUZ?

28:02.010 --> 28:03.978
WE HAD GUYS IN THERE
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.807
YEAH, NOT HER.
NOT ACCORDING TO MY REPORT.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.171
SHE WAS WITH SWAREK WHEN THEY
ARRESTED HIM AT HIS WORK.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.313
(radio chatter)

28:10.350 --> 28:11.487
(copier whirring)

28:11.520 --> 28:13.784
(Frank) WELL, IT WAS
A PRETTY HECTIC DAY--

28:13.820 --> 28:15.082
PEOPLE COMING AND GOING.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.917
MISSING KID. I GET IT,
BUT STILL...

28:16.960 --> 28:19.349
I SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO HER.
IS SHE IN TODAY?

28:19.390 --> 28:22.188
WENT HOME SICK
THIS AFTERNOON.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.291
TELL YOU WHAT.
UM, I'LL CHECK HER NOTES.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.467
GREAT. THAN KS.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.908
MCNALLY.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.804
AREN'T YOU IN THE FIELD
TODAY?

28:39.850 --> 28:41.215
YEAH.

28:41.250 --> 28:44.048
UH, JUST NEEDED
A REQUISITION FORM.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.819
I'M GOING BACK NOW.

28:47.220 --> 28:50.417
(radio chatter)

28:50.460 --> 28:52.428
HEY, MCNALLY?

28:52.460 --> 28:54.098
AN DY?

28:54.130 --> 28:55.757
(door closes)

28:55.800 --> 28:59.759
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
CRUZ WAS AT FORD'S AFTER ALL.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.462
"ATTENDED SEARCH,
30 FURLOUGH."

29:02.500 --> 29:05.060
STILL WANT TO TALK TO HER?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.328
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.509
YOU KNOW, UH, CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

29:09.540 --> 29:11.349
CAN YOU SEND ME A COPY
OF THAT FOR MY REPORT?

29:11.380 --> 29:13.302
YEAH, WILL DO.
THAN KS.

29:13.350 --> 29:17.468
(Siren wailing, radio chatter,
indistinct conversations)

29:28.360 --> 29:30.965
(buttons clicking)

29:31.000 --> 29:33.560
(sighs)

29:33.600 --> 29:36.194
SAM. IT'S DONE.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.764
(hangs up cell phone)

29:38.970 --> 29:41.131
(sighs)

29:41.180 --> 29:44.206
(grunts, panting)

29:44.250 --> 29:47.447
(Siren wailing in distance)

29:47.480 --> 29:51.211
(Sighing)

29:53.350 --> 29:55.284
(phone beeps)

29:55.320 --> 29:58.949
OH, HEY, HI, ANDY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

29:58.990 --> 30:01.595
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD
JUST TOUCH BASE AND LET YOU KNOW

30:01.630 --> 30:04.167
THAT I HAVE A BLISTER
ON MY RIGHT HEEL

30:04.200 --> 30:05.565
THE SIZE OF A POMEGRANATE.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.036
I ALSO HAVE SOME FAIRLY
SIGNIFICANT POLYESTER CHAFE

30:09.070 --> 30:11.402
IN PLACES THAT WILL GO
NAMELESS.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.431
THERE ARE DARK PLACES,
MCNALLY.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.836
VERY DARK PLACES.
SO I WONDER--

30:15.880 --> 30:18.303
ARE YOU PLANNING TO BRING ME
MY SQUAD AT SOME POINT,

30:18.350 --> 30:21.046
OR SHOULD I JUST CONTINUE
CANVASSING ON FOOT

30:21.080 --> 30:22.274
UNTIL I HIT THE STATION?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.185
DO LET ME KNOW, OKAY?
(knocks on door)

30:24.220 --> 30:28.452
ANYWAY... (sighs)
MISS YOU. BYE. KISSES!

30:28.490 --> 30:29.912
(phone beeps)

30:29.960 --> 30:31.985
HI. IS YOUR MOM OR DAD HERE?

30:32.030 --> 30:34.897
(door creaks, radio chatter)

30:34.930 --> 30:36.818
HI, SIR.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.968
SIR, COULD I ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

30:48.080 --> 30:51.948
OKAY, THE BUYER'S IN MOTION.
REPEAT--BUYER'S IN MOTION.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.414
HE'S IN A BLACK HOODED COAT,
UNZIPPED.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.941
BACKUP'S MINUTES AWAY.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.015
WE DON'T HAVE MINUTES.

30:58.050 --> 30:59.187
YOU WAN NA CALL IT OFF?

31:02.960 --> 31:06.088
TEAM, NO BACKUP.
WE ARE ON OUR OWN. LET'S GO.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.160
(engine turns off)

31:17.400 --> 31:20.369
(Speaking inaudibly)

31:23.680 --> 31:26.376
ORDER'S BEEN PLACED.
RUNNER'S ON HIS WAY UP.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.140
BACK IN THE APARTMENT.
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

31:33.190 --> 31:35.078
OH, I KNOW Y'ALL NEED
A SEARCH WARRANT.
CONLON, CONLON, TRUST US.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.008
THE SAFEST PLACE FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW IS BACK INSIDE,

31:37.060 --> 31:38.288
DOOR LOCKED, AND MOUTH SHUT.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.218
(button clicks)

31:46.700 --> 31:48.565
(elevator door opens)

31:52.640 --> 31:55.302
S.U.V.'s MOVING.
HERE THEY COME.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.047
STAND TALL.
LEAD WITH YOUR BADGE.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.547
WE'LL BE FINE.
GOT IT.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.673
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT COPS.
THEY'RE NOT CRAZY.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.642
RIGHT.
WE JUST GOTTA SHOW THEM
THERE'S MORE OF US THAN THEM.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.884
PECK.
YEAH.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.411
YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE, HAVE YOU?
NO.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.678
THEN QUIT GIVING ME ADVICE. IT'S
ONLY MAKING ME MORE NERVOUS.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.620
COPY THAT.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.218
BETTER WATCH IT, NASH.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.352
YOU KEEP CALLING ME
ON MY CRAP,

32:15.400 --> 32:18.096
I'M GONNA FALL FOR YOU
EVEN HARDER THAN I ALREADY AM.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.995
(inhales deeply)

32:20.030 --> 32:21.964
(exhales deeply)
ALL RIGHT. (clears throat)

32:25.340 --> 32:26.659
IT'S ON.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.676
(tires screech)

32:37.120 --> 32:39.111
TWO MEN.

32:48.230 --> 32:51.165
(engine revs, tires screech)

32:53.700 --> 32:55.167
(elevator bell dings)

32:55.200 --> 32:56.690
POLICE!

33:22.400 --> 33:24.618

33:28.740 --> 33:30.662
HERE'S THE INFORMATION YOU NEED.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.634

I GOT HIM HERE, YEAH.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.103
OKAY.
HE'S READY TO GO.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.607
GOOD.
(handcuffs Click)

33:35.640 --> 33:36.607
NASH.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.779
I'LL BE BACK.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.539
(lowered voice) SO WE
WENT OFF BOOK A BIT.

33:43.580 --> 33:44.615
I HEARD.

33:44.650 --> 33:45.719
BUT I'LL GET YOU UP
TO SPEED.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.081
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.212
NASH, ABOUT THAT--
(camera shutter Clicks)

33:48.260 --> 33:49.284
JUST TELL ME
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.151
IT WAS.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.748
THEN WE'RE GOOD.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.258
SEE, I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD HANDLE IT.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.823
(door buzzes in distance)

34:00.870 --> 34:05.409
(radio chatter)

34:05.440 --> 34:06.737
(cell door closes)

34:08.610 --> 34:11.374
(Siren whoops)

34:11.410 --> 34:14.345
(engine turns off,
radio Chatter)

34:18.720 --> 34:20.142
YEAH, THAT'S THE CRUISER
YOU'RE GONNA GET INTO

34:20.190 --> 34:21.259
OVER THERE, ALL RIGHT?

34:21.290 --> 34:23.315
HEY. SO YOU GOT
FORD'S ATTACKER?

34:24.660 --> 34:25.729
I'M SORRY.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.648
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WERE
INTERESTED IN THIS CASE.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.499
OLIVER...

34:29.530 --> 34:31.691
NO, I KNOW. I KNOW. IT'S NOT
GLAMOROUS WORK, MCNALLY,

34:31.730 --> 34:32.867
GOING DOOR TO DOOR,

34:32.900 --> 34:34.458
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.229
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
IT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO

34:36.270 --> 34:37.760
WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.767
I'M SORRY.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.107
OH, DON'T BE.

34:40.140 --> 34:43.109
YOU KNOW HOW I VALUE
MY "ME" TIME.

34:43.140 --> 34:47.839
(Siren wailing)

34:54.460 --> 34:55.586
(door closes)

34:55.620 --> 34:57.884
(door buzzes)

34:57.920 --> 34:59.182
HEY.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.322
HEY.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.191
SO...

35:02.230 --> 35:04.369
FORD APPROACHED HIS SON.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.890
TRIED TO LURE HIM
INTO THE BASEMENT.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.818
(door closes)
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
THE KID TOLD HIS FATHER.

35:07.870 --> 35:10.498
HE WENT NUTS.
FIGHT BROKE OUT.

35:10.540 --> 35:11.802
FORD FELL AND HIT HIS HEAD.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.230
SO FORD IS A PREDATOR.
YEAH, SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.236
I'LL BE SURE TO ASK HIM
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.601
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I DON'T GET ABOUT THIS--

35:19.650 --> 35:22.244
IS HE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN
BEEN SUSPICIOUS

35:22.280 --> 35:24.145
IF A COP HADN'T GONE
DOOR TO DOOR LAST WEEK

35:24.190 --> 35:27.489
ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT FORD.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.909
DID THE OFFICER IDENTIFY
HIMSELF?

35:29.960 --> 35:32.326
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.391
HUH.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.421
SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME,
SWAREK?

35:41.970 --> 35:44.302

35:44.340 --> 35:46.558
NICE WORK OUT THERE.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP TODAY.

HOW ABOUT YOU?

36:08.930 --> 36:10.420
UM...

36:11.930 --> 36:13.295
UNEVENTFUL.

36:13.330 --> 36:15.764
JUST CANVASSING ALL DAY.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.836
I'M JUST GONNA GET CHANGED,
AND THEN WE CAN GO.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.861
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S BEEN KIND OF A LONG WEEK.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.537
I MIGHT JUST CRASH AT MINE
TONIGHT,

36:21.580 --> 36:23.172
CATCH UP ON SOME SLEEP.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.544
OKAY.

36:44.770 --> 36:45.896

36:45.930 --> 36:48.490

36:53.710 --> 36:55.928

37:09.290 --> 37:10.655
YEAH, THAT--THAT ONE'S GOOD,

37:10.690 --> 37:13.227
BUT HE REALLY LIKES
THE TROUT SONG.

37:14.760 --> 37:19.459
WELL, THIS IS JUST GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME FOR HIM...

37:19.500 --> 37:22.537
FOR... ALL OF US.

37:22.570 --> 37:25.607
(sighs)

37:25.640 --> 37:28.404
YEAH. OF COURSE I MISS HIM.

37:28.440 --> 37:32.399
I MISS HIM LIKE YOU...

37:32.450 --> 37:33.576

37:33.610 --> 37:36.670
HE'S ALL--
HE'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.

37:36.720 --> 37:40.281

YEAH. OKAY, WELL,

LET'S DO THIS.

38:05.510 --> 38:07.501
(clapping)

38:07.550 --> 38:09.279
(packaging rustles)

38:10.680 --> 38:16.983
* I DON'T SLEEP
AND THE TELEPHONE DON'T RING *

38:21.030 --> 38:22.998
* IT'S UNUSUAL

38:23.030 --> 38:25.828
WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA REMEMBER
ABOUT TODAY

38:25.870 --> 38:28.691
IS THAT A... PEDOPHILE
GOT BEATEN,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.560
AND THE GUY THAT DID IT
GOT ARRESTED.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.659
YOU DID A GOOD THING.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.736
HMM.
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT?

38:35.780 --> 38:36.804
I BELIEVE YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.104
HOW COME IT'S SO EASY
FOR YOU,

38:39.150 --> 38:40.777
JUST TO COME UP
WITH YOUR OWN SET OF RULES?

38:40.810 --> 38:42.016
AND YOU'RE SO SURE
OF THEM.

38:42.050 --> 38:45.019
MCNALLY--
WHAT IF I DON'T WANNA
FOLLOW YOUR RULES, SAM?

38:45.050 --> 38:48.451
WHAT IF I JUST WANNA FOLLOW
THE NORMAL ONES?

38:48.490 --> 38:55.953
BE STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND... HARDWORKING. ..

38:56.000 --> 38:57.592
AND OPEN.

38:57.630 --> 38:59.063
ANDY...

39:00.970 --> 39:03.894
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.600
I MEAN THAT.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.005
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.541
(sighs)

39:17.580 --> 39:20.913
(indistinct conversations)

39:20.950 --> 39:21.951

39:21.990 --> 39:23.753
(Traci) HEY.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.918
SO OPERATION DRIFTNET--
UH, DID YOU BREAK THE RECORD?

39:26.960 --> 39:29.155
NO, WE CAME UP SHORT.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.827
OH. SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.828
BUT IT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE IN LIGHT
OF THE JACKSON IRVING ARREST,

39:32.870 --> 39:35.532
FRANK'S OVER THE MOON.
MM-HMM.

39:35.570 --> 39:36.594
SO THANKS FOR THAT.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.937
OH, NO. THAT WAS ALL YOU.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.608
I WAS JUST THERE
TO CHEER YOU ON.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.906
I WAS ACTUALLY COMING
TO FIND YOU.

39:43.940 --> 39:50.573
OH?
I WONDERED IF MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO GO CELEBRATE WITH ME

39:50.620 --> 39:52.087
AND GO HAVE A DRINK.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.908
MM. IT'S INTERESTING.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.110
INTERESTING?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.754
YEAH. (sighs) WHILE I'VE
BEEN PURSUING YOU FOR WEEKS,

40:00.790 --> 40:02.052
BUT ONLY ON THE DAY YOU CATCH
A NOTORIOUS GANGSTER

40:02.100 --> 40:03.419
DO YOU BITE.

40:03.460 --> 40:06.793
(sighs)
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT.

40:06.830 --> 40:12.166
YOU KNOW, THERE'S KIND OF
A CODE TO THIS--BEING ASKED OUT.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.165
IS THAT RIGHT?

40:13.210 --> 40:14.529
SHORT ANSWERS ARE GOOD.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.879
YES. "YES" IS MY ANSWER.

40:17.910 --> 40:21.141
(sighs) ALL RIGHT, THEN.
SHALL WE?

40:24.850 --> 40:26.511
JUST LET ME GET THAT.

40:26.550 --> 40:27.847
THANK YOU.
AH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.448
(laughs)

40:29.490 --> 40:30.354

40:30.390 --> 40:33.120

TO GET TO FIRST BASE,

40:33.160 --> 40:34.127

40:34.160 --> 40:36.697
TAKE DOWN A WHOLE
CRIME FAMILY OR SOMETHING?

40:36.730 --> 40:37.822
WELL, KEEP SAYING
"FIRST BASE."

40:37.860 --> 40:41.023
SEE WHAT THAT DOES
FOR YOUR CHANCES.

40:41.070 --> 40:42.560
(radio chatter)

40:44.740 --> 40:46.662
(door creaks)

40:52.050 --> 40:55.019

41:15.300 --> 41:16.858
I'M SO SORRY.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.539
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.137
SLEEP.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.704
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.240

41:27.280 --> 41:29.771
(Zaac Pick's "Drifters" playing)

41:29.820 --> 41:30.946
NO.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.217
NO ONE'S IN TROUBLE.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.856
* OH, LET IT FALL

41:37.890 --> 41:42.122
* THIS MOUNTAIN OVER ME

41:42.160 --> 41:44.128

41:44.160 --> 41:45.991
HEY.

41:46.030 --> 41:48.123
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:48.170 --> 41:50.138
JUST LOOKING FOR YOU.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.603

41:51.640 --> 41:56.668

41:58.110 --> 41:59.600

41:59.650 --> 42:02.642

42:02.680 --> 42:04.011
OF COURSE.

42:04.050 --> 42:07.918
(stool scrapes floor)

42:07.950 --> 42:11.010
HEY, CAN I GET
TWO MORE OF THOSE?

42:11.060 --> 42:15.656
*I

42:15.700 --> 42:19.818
* WASH IT OVER ME
