-Yes, because nothing's
cuter than science.

Fine.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.980
Well, it hums.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.510
I like that in a device.

-Kowalski, you too?

was a dangerous weapon.

MARLENE: Hey, Mason.

18:54.150 --> 18:59.130
So, any buzz on how the
old swaperoo's working out?

18:59.130 --> 18:59.830
-Hmm.

It's cotton candy.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.840
It's cotton candy,
in the park, K?

19:17.840 --> 19:18.620
I saw it, K?

19:18.620 --> 19:19.320
I smelled it.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.240
And I want it.

We need to get Skipper
on it right away.

19:21.780 --> 19:22.480

What is that?

No school?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.570
'Cause it ain't old school.

And it ain't new school.

big, important mission.

do is admit that he

it off, that'll
