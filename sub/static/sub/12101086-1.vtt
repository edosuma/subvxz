WEBVTT

00:45.947 --> 00:49.751
Yeah, of course we're
still exclusive, Tiff.

00:51.019 --> 00:52.219
Oh, don't listen to Chelsea.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.421
Chelsea asked me before
I even knew we were

00:54.454 --> 00:56.490
so it's like, I don't
know what to tell her.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.728
Hey, hold on.

01:03.031 --> 01:03.865
Hello?

01:07.936 --> 01:09.369
Hey, who's there?

01:11.338 --> 01:14.341
Hey, whoever you are, show
yourself.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.951
That's what I thought, some
pussy ass kids or something.

01:22.984 --> 01:26.854
No, of course I'm not
gonna bone her, okay?

01:26.888 --> 01:29.256
You know, she smells
like a rotten pumpkin.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.123
Chelsea?

01:30.157 --> 01:31.659
She looks like Don Knotts.

01:31.693 --> 01:32.527
Gross!

01:33.861 --> 01:34.662
Whoa!

01:34.696 --> 01:35.697
Yo, yo, bro.

01:36.965 --> 01:41.101
I'm a real deal legit
MMA champ around here.

01:41.134 --> 01:44.939
You're tangling with
the fucking king, bruh.

01:44.973 --> 01:46.841
Oh, that's how it's gonna be?

01:46.874 --> 01:50.044
This motherfucker wants to step
to me?

01:51.244 --> 01:54.414
Tiff, I'm gonna have to call you
back.

01:58.753 --> 01:59.954
Hello?

01:59.988 --> 02:01.488
Thad?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.957
Hello?

02:02.991 --> 02:03.858
Whatever.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.126

Chelsea.

02:06.159 --> 02:09.097

Dear
Hawk, when we asked you

04:06.446 --> 04:08.015
to move out six months ago,

04:08.049 --> 04:10.317
we did not mean into the
backyard.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.352
Your hobo camp is
killing the grass

04:12.385 --> 04:14.188
and the neighbors
complained to the city

04:14.222 --> 04:15.623
about the smell again.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.793
Also, if you're reading
this, you broke in.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.428
But this time, the
alarm was on, wasn't it?

04:21.461 --> 04:22.897
That's right.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.364
The police are on their way

04:24.397 --> 04:27.135
and you're no longer authorized
to be on the property.

04:27.168 --> 04:30.270
Again, this does not mean
we don't love you, son.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.607
It just means it's time
to leave the nest.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.442
All the best, mom and dad.

04:54.262 --> 04:55.096
Oh!

04:57.999 --> 05:03.004
You get back
here, you son of a bitch!

05:30.531 --> 05:31.331
Sorry I'm late.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.567
This rabid soccer mom

05:32.600 --> 05:35.503
just tried to murder
me with her minivan.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.469
You wanna talk about it?

05:36.504 --> 05:37.305
No!

05:37.337 --> 05:38.739
I want her to die.

05:38.773 --> 05:39.807
That's good.

05:39.841 --> 05:40.875
Get the anger out.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.009
Fine.

05:42.043 --> 05:45.279
I want her little shiny
minivan to explode into flames

05:45.313 --> 05:48.082
and her whole un-American
soccer-playing family

05:48.115 --> 05:50.251
to roast alive and crackle!

05:50.284 --> 05:51.185
Okay, I get it.

05:51.219 --> 05:53.120
We all have our inner
battles to fight.

05:53.154 --> 05:53.955
Why don't you join in?

05:53.988 --> 05:55.189
It might make you feel better.

05:55.223 --> 05:56.891
What, do I just...

05:58.326 --> 05:59.594
Yeah, like that.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.229
Just like...

06:01.262 --> 06:02.096
Yeah.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.464
Yeah, focus on your breathing.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.498
That's good.

06:07.001 --> 06:08.836
Just like that.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.204
Wow.

06:10.238 --> 06:11.739
That's good, Hawk.

06:12.874 --> 06:14.609
How does this help
us kick ass again?

06:14.642 --> 06:15.442
It doesn't.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.111
I'm a vegan pacifist, remember?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.680
What, are we supposed to keep
doing it?

06:19.714 --> 06:21.816
Yes, until you come
to terms with your anger

06:21.849 --> 06:22.884
and you can manage it.

06:22.917 --> 06:23.885
Yeah, well, that could be a
while.

06:23.918 --> 06:26.354
My asshole parents just
kicked me out again.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.221
I thought you were out.

06:27.255 --> 06:28.956
I was out,

06:28.990 --> 06:30.024
in the yard.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.727
Now they want me out out,
like off the property.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.161
Well, it is about time, right?

06:34.195 --> 06:35.963
Who's freaking side are you on
here?

06:35.997 --> 06:36.864
That's good, Hawk.

06:36.898 --> 06:37.698
Go for it.

06:37.732 --> 06:38.933
Express how you really feel.

06:38.966 --> 06:39.767
Fine!

06:39.800 --> 06:40.601
I want them to die, Rev.

06:40.635 --> 06:42.670
I want them all to die, every
one!

06:42.703 --> 06:44.338
I want everyone to die!

06:44.372 --> 06:48.276
Death, dismember, dead,
murder!

06:48.309 --> 06:49.610
Okay.

06:49.644 --> 06:51.478
We might be here a while.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.915
In other news
tonight, local MMA champ,

06:53.948 --> 06:56.784
Thadwick Dunfrey was
found dead earlier today.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.886
Police claim it's an isolated
incident

06:58.920 --> 07:01.522
with no connection to
all the other recent...

07:01.555 --> 07:02.356
I'm sorry.

07:02.390 --> 07:03.291
Where was I?

07:03.324 --> 07:04.825
You were explaining why you
were late

07:04.859 --> 07:05.660
again.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.493
Jesus Christ!

07:06.527 --> 07:07.595
What's the big deal?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.397
It's an empty goddamn
building for Christ's sakes.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.133
First of all, please stop
using the Lord's name in vain.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.669
And second, your shift
starts at seven, Hawk.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.805
And every time you're late, you
really...

07:17.838 --> 07:18.639
You screw me.

07:18.673 --> 07:19.472
Oh, don't worry.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.308
I won't tell your wives.

07:20.341 --> 07:21.742
I mean, this has got to stop.

07:21.776 --> 07:22.576
I got it.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.577
I'm sorry.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.913
My asshole prick parents
finally kicked me out.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.415
It's been kind of a rough day.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.516
Look on the bright side.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.318
I mean, at least you can
finally get your own place.

07:30.351 --> 07:31.218
Yeah, right.

07:31.252 --> 07:32.787
I could barely even get this
shit job

07:32.820 --> 07:36.257
after Uncle Sam boned me
on that whole assault BS.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.126
Well, you did stab a fellow
soldier with a two by four.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.028
Prepare to face your death,
Dirkman.

07:41.062 --> 07:43.764
Never, human scum!

07:52.139 --> 07:55.543
Take that, you undead piece of
garbage.

07:57.011 --> 07:59.847
Shit, I guess I'm going to
prison.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.516
He was a bloodsucking,
allergic to the sun,

08:02.550 --> 08:04.585
filthy ass vampire, Arnold,

08:04.618 --> 08:07.321
and I would stab him a
thousand more times if I could.

08:07.355 --> 08:09.657
You do realize vampires
don't exist, right?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.758
If they don't exist,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.860
why the hell did I stab
that man with a two by four?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595
'Cause you're a paranoid
schizophrenic

08:14.628 --> 08:15.830
who better be taking his meds

08:15.863 --> 08:17.598
or his PO is gonna
be getting a call.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.432
All right, all right.

08:18.466 --> 08:19.266
Jesus!

08:19.300 --> 08:20.968
No need for threats.

08:26.374 --> 08:29.643
Hey, you mind if I
leave some of my stuff?

08:29.677 --> 08:30.911
Absolutely not.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.246
And in lieu of your tardiness,

08:32.279 --> 08:34.115
I'm gonna need you to
drop some breaks tonight.

08:34.148 --> 08:36.650
My breaks are legally mandated
by the federal government.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.918
And if you've got a problem with
that,

08:37.952 --> 08:39.687
you take it up with the damn
liberals.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.955
I thought you were an
anarchist.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.523
Not when it comes to my
breaks.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.912
I can still taste the blood.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.314
Mother effin' vampires.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.083
This way, Forneus.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.218
Say cheese, fang faces.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.354
What was that?

09:47.388 --> 09:48.456
Oh, shit!

09:48.489 --> 09:50.559
It came from over here.

09:58.032 --> 10:01.402
Must have just been a
headlight or something.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.703
All right.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.971
Let's get this little guy
inside.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.606
I'm famished.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.041
Come on, Forneus.

10:09.477 --> 10:10.945
Hey, it's Hawk.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.947
Either they're filming
another remake of Lost Boys

10:12.980 --> 10:15.983
or I just saw some filthy ass
vampires.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.084
Office, ASAP.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.662
You did not office ASAP.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.663
I was on the bus.

10:29.697 --> 10:32.333
But I called and told
you I saw vampires,

10:32.366 --> 10:34.536
like straight out of Lost Boys.

10:34.569 --> 10:36.737
Again, I was on the bus.

10:39.273 --> 10:40.341
Is that porn?

10:40.374 --> 10:41.842
No, it's public domain.

10:41.876 --> 10:42.877
It's porn.

10:44.145 --> 10:46.280
It's nonxploitation, actually.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.381
Non?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.316
You know what, Hawk, never mind.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.918
What is it that I'm doing here?

10:50.951 --> 10:51.785
I mean, this isn't like the
first time

10:51.819 --> 10:53.154
that this has happened before.

10:53.187 --> 10:55.890
Actually, Rev, it's
very, very different.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.724
How so?

10:56.757 --> 10:57.791
Well, for one,

10:57.825 --> 11:00.895
they had one of those guys
in a leather mask deal.

11:00.928 --> 11:01.862
Like a gimp?

11:01.896 --> 11:04.431
Yeah, on a leash,
and they went into 201.

11:04.465 --> 11:05.567
201's vacant.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.967
Not anymore it's not.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.369
It's filled with a bunch of
these guys

11:08.402 --> 11:12.139
and their beady black
eyes and bloody mouths.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.912
I thought you couldn't
take pictures of vampires.

11:20.080 --> 11:20.881
So I don't understand.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.116
They don't give you a key?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.050
It isn't in the contract.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.752
They didn't give me healthcare
either.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.587
So you're just supposed to
guard

11:25.620 --> 11:26.720
the outside of the building?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.721
Yeah.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.023
I guess whatever they
do behind closed doors

11:29.056 --> 11:30.057
is their business.

11:30.090 --> 11:30.891
What about you?

11:30.925 --> 11:31.959
You're the janitor.

11:31.992 --> 11:32.927
Don't you get a key?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.930
Actually, I'm the
groundskeeper, so.

11:35.963 --> 11:36.764
Whatever.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.731
Is that an actual lock pick?

11:37.765 --> 11:38.699
Negative.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.901
It's my mini Swiss army.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.604
What?

11:42.637 --> 11:43.404
It's good enough for the Swiss
army,

11:43.437 --> 11:44.573
it's good enough for me.

11:44.606 --> 11:46.073
All right, I need to get back
to work.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.610
That dog poop is not gonna clean
itself.

11:48.643 --> 11:50.978
Ooh, Rev, look at this.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.213
Hawk, no, no, no.

11:52.246 --> 11:53.747
That's, that's oil.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.749
Oh, that's oil.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.319
That comes from cars.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.721
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.

12:00.754 --> 12:04.892
I swear to God, Rev, on my
mother's grave, I saw them.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.428
Your mother's alive, Hawk.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.129
Your mother's alive.

12:15.436 --> 12:16.270
Dammit.

12:24.546 --> 12:26.648
Hawk, I told you not
to call this number.

12:26.681 --> 12:28.148
You gotta call dispatch.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.216
Yeah, sorry, Jack.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.485
It's just, they keep hanging up
on me.

12:31.519 --> 12:34.723
And my fight against the
injustice and supernatural,

12:34.755 --> 12:35.923
it just can't wait.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.957
Fine.

12:36.991 --> 12:37.791
Go ahead.

12:37.825 --> 12:38.627
Okay.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.395
I wanna report some very highly,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.364
extremely suspicious activity.

12:43.397 --> 12:44.566
Mm-hmm.

12:44.599 --> 12:47.702
Earlier tonight, this
very highly suspicious SUV

12:47.736 --> 12:49.303
pulled up in our alley.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.372
So naturally, I went to go check
it out.

12:51.405 --> 12:52.373
Naturally.

12:52.406 --> 12:54.709
Yeah, so I went over
there

12:54.743 --> 12:57.444
and what do you know,
out popped two vampires.

12:57.478 --> 12:58.680
Two vampires?

12:58.713 --> 13:01.982
Yeah, like the
gang from Lost Boys.

13:02.016 --> 13:03.350
The original or the
sequels?

13:03.384 --> 13:04.184
The original.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.819
Not such a big fan of the
sequels.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.920
Yeah, me neither.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.789
You do realize that
false reporting of crime

13:08.822 --> 13:10.291
is a violation of your
probation.

13:10.324 --> 13:11.660
This actually happened.

13:11.693 --> 13:12.960
That's what you said
about the sleeper cell.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.461
Yes, but this time is
different.

13:14.495 --> 13:16.497
And that's also what you said
about the Russians invading.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.866
Well, I saw Red Dawn one
too many times that week.

13:18.899 --> 13:19.800
And the werewolves?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.802
Well, that time, I just plain
messed up.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.104
All right, Hawk, here's
what's gonna happen.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.373
You stop calling in crazy stuff
in the middle of the night.

13:26.407 --> 13:28.743
In exchange, I'm not gonna
arrest you.

13:28.777 --> 13:29.644
Got it?

13:29.678 --> 13:30.779
- But...
- Bye.

13:32.046 --> 13:33.047
Goddammit.

No.

14:18.158 --> 14:18.959
I don't what happened.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.829
They just disappeared or
something,

14:20.861 --> 14:22.863
kinda like all these folks.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.365
Yeah, that's what they do.

14:24.398 --> 14:25.966
What, the people or the
vampires?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.135
The imaginary things
you see in your head.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.471
I did not imagine them, Rev.

14:30.505 --> 14:31.740
Well, at least you didn't
call the police again.

14:31.773 --> 14:32.774
That's good.

14:36.377 --> 14:37.177
No!

14:37.211 --> 14:38.011
It doesn't even matter.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.113
They didn't believe me anyway,
so.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.315
You reported vampires
with a gimp on a leash.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.584
Oh, okay.

14:42.617 --> 14:45.553
I see how it is.

14:45.587 --> 14:46.588
Oh, come on, Hawk.

14:46.621 --> 14:47.421
I'm sorry.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.656
I just, I don't wanna see you

14:48.690 --> 14:50.257
get in trouble again, that's
all.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.091
I agree, Rev.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.126
You are sorry.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.762
You're a four-eyed,
bird-legged groundskeeper

14:53.795 --> 14:55.730
who doubts his friends.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.266
Are we still doing tai chi

What the hell, man?

15:45.279 --> 15:46.079
Hey, Hawk.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.281
I didn't realize you were home.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.884
What the hell does that mean?

15:59.460 --> 16:02.396
No, I called it in because I
thought it was a real threat.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.064
These three vampires.

16:04.097 --> 16:04.899
Yeah.

16:04.933 --> 16:05.966
Well, no.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.736
Two of them were vampires,
one of them was a gimp.

16:08.770 --> 16:09.571
A gimp.

16:09.604 --> 16:10.872
Yes, on a leash.

16:10.905 --> 16:12.072
A gimp on a leash?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.140
Yes!

16:13.173 --> 16:15.810
Jesus Christ, has no one
in this town heard of S&M?

16:15.844 --> 16:16.945
I'm a Mormon, Hawk.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.446
And please, stop using
the Lord's name in vain!

16:19.480 --> 16:21.448
What is your point, Arnold?

16:21.482 --> 16:23.083
That is my point.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.493
Hey, it's Hawk.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.127
Yeah, I just wanted to say I'm
real sorry

16:34.161 --> 16:36.497
about calling you four eyed,
bird legged,

16:36.531 --> 16:39.132
and ignoring you on the
beach earlier today.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.835
It just, it really hurts

16:40.869 --> 16:44.104
when my only friend in the
world doesn't believe me.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.206
Anyway, I've been thinking more
about it,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.308
and it is all in my head.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.714
Maybe I've been imagining the
whole thing.

16:54.516 --> 16:56.149
Holy shit!

16:56.183 --> 16:58.018
They're back.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.654
We should probably call this
in.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.689
I already did, remember?

17:01.723 --> 17:03.257
They're not gonna believe us.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.458
What if I do it?

17:04.491 --> 17:05.527
They'll still think it's me.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.360
Trust me.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.427
You call them that much?

17:07.461 --> 17:10.097
The world's a terrifying
place, Rev.

17:10.130 --> 17:10.965
Shit!

17:12.132 --> 17:13.166
Did they see us?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.067
No.

17:14.101 --> 17:14.903
Did they see us?

17:14.936 --> 17:15.904
Shh.

17:15.937 --> 17:16.905
Are you kidding me?

17:16.938 --> 17:17.872
Sorry.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.807
Wow, look at that gimp.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.077
I think I sharted.

17:24.111 --> 17:24.946
Oh, God.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.431
All right, I'll be willing to
consider...

17:44.464 --> 17:46.266
Yes, I knew it.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.836
If and only if we lay
out some ground rules.

17:48.870 --> 17:49.904
Rules of engagement.

17:49.938 --> 17:50.738
I love it.

17:50.772 --> 17:51.739
What did you have in mind?

17:51.773 --> 17:54.074
First off, no hurting
or killing of any kind.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.743
Wait, does that rule out
staking?

17:55.777 --> 17:57.477
Staking hurts and/or kills.

17:57.512 --> 17:58.312
Okay.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.180
What about asphyxiation by
garlic?

18:00.213 --> 18:01.381
Asphyxiat...

18:02.550 --> 18:03.450
Asphyxiation.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.318
Asphyxi...

18:04.351 --> 18:05.285
Asphyxiation.

18:05.319 --> 18:07.689
Asphyxiation implies hurting
or killing.

18:07.722 --> 18:09.891
Okay, well, how about
holy water boarding?

18:09.924 --> 18:10.892
Water boarding is torture.

18:10.925 --> 18:11.926
So even if it's holy?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.127
Yes, that is the same...

18:14.161 --> 18:16.296
Secondly, we get help.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.297
No, no.

18:17.331 --> 18:19.067
I'm a black belt and I
was army special ops.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.001
I got this.

18:20.034 --> 18:23.303
You guarded urinal cakes and
TP, Hawk.

18:24.539 --> 18:25.974
Fine.

18:26.007 --> 18:27.341
I got a guy.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.643
I'll text him.

18:28.676 --> 18:29.476
And no arrests.

18:29.510 --> 18:30.310
What?

18:30.344 --> 18:31.411
Jesus Christ!

18:34.181 --> 18:35.984
Are you really gonna wear that?

18:36.017 --> 18:37.250
I like my jumpsuit.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.886
Yeah, but you always wear
them.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.421
I mean, what if we have to
do cloak and dagger stuff?

18:41.455 --> 18:44.092
What, like sitting on street
corners?

18:44.124 --> 18:44.926
Oh, shit.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.460
There he is.

18:50.064 --> 18:51.164
Where'd you find this guy?

18:51.198 --> 18:54.201
Oh, army prison, maximum
security.

18:55.703 --> 18:57.872
Put these on your faces.

18:58.740 --> 18:59.641
And get in.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.526
Okay, take off the blindfolds.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.531
Hawk, he's got a gun.

19:23.564 --> 19:24.799
No shit, Rev.

19:24.832 --> 19:27.267
Okay, tell me who sent you.

19:29.937 --> 19:31.338
Tell me or you're gonna
know what it's like

19:31.371 --> 19:33.273
to have hot metal pierce your
flesh.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.242
Actually, I kinda know
what that feels like.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.111
I actually shot myself in
bootcamp.

19:37.145 --> 19:37.979
Shut up.

19:38.980 --> 19:39.947
Who are you?

19:39.981 --> 19:42.650
It's Hawk from cell block
nine.

19:42.684 --> 19:46.486
You stopped that Nazi
skinhead from raping me.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.388
I'm the guy who stabbed

19:48.422 --> 19:52.126
the vampire soldier with a two
by four.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.061
Oh, yeah.

19:54.662 --> 19:56.430
I remember you.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.132
You're the dumbest guy I ever
met.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.133
Oh, that's him.

19:59.167 --> 20:00.400
Shut the fuck up, hippie!

20:00.434 --> 20:01.401
Oh, no, no, no.

20:01.435 --> 20:02.369
He's cool, he's cool.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.738
This is my partner, Rev.

20:03.771 --> 20:04.972
It's not his fault.

20:05.006 --> 20:09.443
His folks brought him up on a
vegan, yogi, nudist commune.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.764
What are you looking at,
hippie?

20:29.797 --> 20:30.631
Nothing.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.101
No, you're looking at my eye.

20:33.134 --> 20:34.035
No, I wasn't.

20:34.068 --> 20:34.902
I swear.

20:34.936 --> 20:36.104
You're making fun of my
handicap.

20:36.137 --> 20:37.404
No, sir.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.173
You know what?

20:39.207 --> 20:41.209
I lost this eye so you could buy
gas

20:41.241 --> 20:43.544
for that foreign car you drive.

20:43.578 --> 20:44.812
I'm a bus passenger.

20:44.846 --> 20:45.980
- I don't drive.
- Shut up.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.515
You were saying.

20:47.548 --> 20:48.649
Oh, yeah.

20:48.683 --> 20:50.985
We got a vampire problem.

20:51.018 --> 20:51.953
Vampire?

20:51.986 --> 20:53.020
Uh-huh.

20:53.054 --> 20:56.858
Black eyes, blood mouths,
and a gimp on a leash.

20:56.891 --> 20:58.059
A gimp on a leash?

20:58.092 --> 21:00.561
Yeah, like an S&M mask or
whatever.

21:00.595 --> 21:01.829
I'll look into it.

21:01.863 --> 21:05.066
Actually, we were hoping
that you might wanna

21:05.099 --> 21:07.802
maybe take care of this
with us, like together.

21:07.835 --> 21:08.803
You know what?

21:08.836 --> 21:11.371
I'm more of a lone wolf
type of operator so...

21:11.404 --> 21:12.173
That's great.

21:12.206 --> 21:13.241
We love wolves.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.842
Yeah, they're our favorite
animal.

21:14.876 --> 21:16.577
I work alone, no partners.

21:16.611 --> 21:17.612
I tend to kill 'em.

21:17.645 --> 21:20.515
So if there's nothing else.

21:20.548 --> 21:21.481
No, wait.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.919
What about being like a mentor?

21:24.952 --> 21:26.888
You ever thought about that?

21:26.921 --> 21:29.824
I mean, you can still
be your lone wolf self,

21:29.857 --> 21:32.894
but you can also help
out some cubs in need

21:32.927 --> 21:36.264
and passing down your lone wolf
tricks.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.132
And what's in it for the lone
wolf?

21:38.166 --> 21:41.334
I guess these cubs could do
things with their cub talents

21:41.368 --> 21:43.336
like this cub can guard.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.239
And this cub's a
groundskeeping engineer.

21:45.273 --> 21:46.140
Like a janitor?

21:46.174 --> 21:47.141
Yeah, but on the outside.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.276
Hmm, like a guard?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.877
Less with plants.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.888
I looked at your eye.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.097
All right, here's a list.

22:10.131 --> 22:11.431
Meet me here after sundown.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.735
And remember, this mission and
my mentorship, a top secret.

22:14.769 --> 22:15.570
You understand?

22:15.603 --> 22:16.403
Sir, yes, sir.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.370
Sir, yes, sir.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.371
What the hell was that?

22:18.405 --> 22:19.273
I'm saluting you, sir.

22:19.307 --> 22:21.042
You're our lone wolf mentor now,
sir.

22:21.075 --> 22:21.876
Sir, yes,

22:21.909 --> 22:22.710
sir, yes, sir.

22:22.743 --> 22:24.011
Cut the shit.

22:24.846 --> 22:26.948
Now, close your eyes
and count to a hundred.

22:26.981 --> 22:27.882
Don't even!

22:30.417 --> 22:33.420
One, two,
three, four.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.089
I feel like that went really
well.

22:35.122 --> 22:35.923
I think so too.

22:35.957 --> 22:37.859
I said a hundred.

22:37.892 --> 22:38.793
Five.

22:38.826 --> 22:42.063
Six, seven,
eight, nine,

22:42.096 --> 22:42.930
10, 11,

22:44.165 --> 22:44.999
12, 13.

22:46.067 --> 22:46.868
When do we stop?

22:46.901 --> 22:48.002
14, 15.

22:48.035 --> 22:48.836
Keep going, Rev.

22:48.870 --> 22:50.538
- Six, seven, 18.
- What?

22:50.571 --> 22:52.673
- You went backwards.
- 19.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.650
Okay, item one, garlic, five
pounds.

23:02.683 --> 23:03.784
Grocery store?

23:03.818 --> 23:05.052
Yeah, but remember, no
asphyx...

23:05.086 --> 23:06.153
Asphyxiation.

23:06.187 --> 23:07.355
Yes, I got it.

23:08.856 --> 23:09.657
I don't know.

23:09.690 --> 23:10.691
Are you sure about this?

23:10.725 --> 23:11.525
Yeah.

23:11.559 --> 23:13.493
I'm only touching organic
garlic.

23:13.527 --> 23:15.963
It just seems like a
conspiracy.

23:15.997 --> 23:19.267
One could say the same
thing about vampires.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.903
Item two, two by fours, lots.

23:21.936 --> 23:23.137
I guess the lumber company.

23:23.170 --> 23:24.772
Yeah, but remember, no
staking.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.406
Yes, I remember.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.042
Here you go.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.310
You got this.

23:29.343 --> 23:30.511
Yeah, it's too much.

23:30.544 --> 23:31.612
I'm gonna fall.

23:31.646 --> 23:32.813
Yeah, I'm gonna fall.

23:32.847 --> 23:33.648
I am, I am.

23:33.681 --> 23:34.481
Are you good?

23:34.515 --> 23:35.316
No, I'm falling.

23:35.349 --> 23:36.350
I'm falling.

23:37.852 --> 23:41.022
Item three, holy water, 10
gallons.

23:41.055 --> 23:42.757
I guess we're in the right place
for that.

23:42.790 --> 23:43.824
Uh-huh, but just remember...

23:43.858 --> 23:46.060
For the love of goddamn
Satan, Rev, I got it.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.161
Jesus Christ.

23:49.363 --> 23:50.631
Sorry, sisters.

24:17.992 --> 24:18.960
Can I help you?

24:18.993 --> 24:20.127
Yeah.

24:20.161 --> 24:21.629
Yeah, hi there.

24:21.662 --> 24:24.665
My friend here and I, we do
baptisms

24:26.367 --> 24:28.636
and we kinda ran out of holy
water.

24:28.669 --> 24:30.137
How much did you need?

24:30.171 --> 24:31.772
10 gallons would do the trick.

24:31.806 --> 24:32.940
10

24:32.974 --> 24:33.874
gallons?

24:33.908 --> 24:35.209
Yeah, 10 gallons.

24:35.242 --> 24:37.411
Wow, that's a lot of baptisms.

24:37.445 --> 24:38.379
What can I say?

24:38.412 --> 24:40.982
Folks love almost drowning for
their fate.

24:41.015 --> 24:41.949
Are you guys hunting vampires?

24:41.983 --> 24:43.951
No, why would you ask that?

24:43.985 --> 24:45.619
Yeah, that's a weird question.

24:45.653 --> 24:49.256
Not really when you think
about it.

24:49.290 --> 24:50.858
Guys, relax, okay?

24:50.891 --> 24:52.093
Your secret's safe with me.

24:52.126 --> 24:54.195
I'm actually writing a book
about vampires

24:54.228 --> 24:56.364
and was hoping to tag along

24:56.397 --> 24:59.767
with a couple of real vampire
slayers, maybe even help out,

24:59.800 --> 25:01.635
you know, for research.

25:01.669 --> 25:03.571
- Yeah, that might work.
- Uh, no.

25:03.604 --> 25:05.873
Help from a girl and a writer?

25:05.906 --> 25:07.108
I don't think so.

25:07.141 --> 25:08.843
Well, maybe I should
call the authorities then.

25:08.876 --> 25:09.677
Nope.

25:09.710 --> 25:10.911
Welcome co the team.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.486
Great, what are we
supposed to do with this?

25:18.519 --> 25:19.320
What do you think?

25:19.353 --> 25:21.555
Spray it on damn vampires, Rev.

25:21.589 --> 25:22.923
Well, it's just so small.

25:22.957 --> 25:24.158
Well, then we'll mix it with
water.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.693
But then it'll be diluted.

25:25.726 --> 25:27.561
Can you just let me
decompress?

25:27.595 --> 25:29.630
We just got blackmailed by a
girl writer.

25:29.663 --> 25:32.767
Yeah, but at least
she gave you her number.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.002
♪ Ah ah ah ♪

25:35.036 --> 25:37.238
♪ Oh oh oh ♪

25:37.271 --> 25:40.141

25:40.174 --> 25:41.876

25:53.587 --> 25:54.722

25:58.527 --> 25:59.360
Okay.

26:01.996 --> 26:02.797
Strip.

26:02.830 --> 26:03.697
What?

26:03.731 --> 26:04.533
Is he kidding?

26:04.565 --> 26:05.833
I don't kid about wires.

26:05.866 --> 26:06.667
Do it!

26:06.700 --> 26:07.501
This is ridiculous.

26:07.536 --> 26:09.070
Who would we even wear a wire
for?

26:09.103 --> 26:10.071
Yeah, that's a really good
point.

26:10.104 --> 26:12.640
I will shoot you dead
right here on this road.

26:12.673 --> 26:13.508
Do it!

26:22.216 --> 26:24.718
He's got a lot more clothes.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.456
All the way, let's go.

26:31.659 --> 26:32.993
Now bend over and cough.

26:33.027 --> 26:34.462
No, come on.

26:34.495 --> 26:35.930
Now, jack offs!

26:40.334 --> 26:43.003
All right, all right, all right.

26:44.672 --> 26:45.507
Okay.

26:47.174 --> 26:48.609
Where's my stuff?

26:54.715 --> 26:55.983
What the hell is this?

26:56.016 --> 26:58.252
It's all they had.

26:58.285 --> 27:00.555
Give me the two by fours.

27:01.622 --> 27:04.492
Just so you know, we tried
to get lots of two by fours

27:04.526 --> 27:09.396
but we could only safely
carry one on a bike at a time.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.365
And the garlic?

27:11.398 --> 27:14.168
They only had one bag left,
organic.

27:14.201 --> 27:18.038
Rev said the GMO ones
give you kids with tails.

27:18.072 --> 27:19.840
And deformed limbs.

27:23.711 --> 27:26.581
Tell him about that girl
we met at the store.

27:26.615 --> 27:27.781
She's our new teammate.

27:27.815 --> 27:30.151
She's a mystery novelist,
and she gave Hawk her number.

27:30.184 --> 27:31.152
No, Rev.

27:31.185 --> 27:32.720
I had the lowest of
hopes of you two idiots.

27:32.753 --> 27:34.188
This is pathetic!

27:37.559 --> 27:40.060
Does this mean the mentorship
is over?

27:40.094 --> 27:43.097
You wanna know what it means?

27:43.130 --> 27:48.135
It means if you two come
anywhere near me.

27:53.407 --> 27:55.409
Give me the clothes.

27:55.442 --> 27:57.512
Give me the clothes, now!

27:59.046 --> 28:00.649
I need help.

28:00.681 --> 28:01.482
I looked at your eye again.

28:01.516 --> 28:02.416
I didn't mean to.

28:02.449 --> 28:05.019
Have fun walking, turd birds.

28:14.762 --> 28:15.597
Wow.

28:16.830 --> 28:19.266
Your parents' backyard
was pretty bleak but...

28:19.300 --> 28:20.100
What?

28:20.134 --> 28:21.302
No, it's fine.

28:23.672 --> 28:25.339
It's pretty bad, Hawk.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.642
Well, I don't blame him for a
second.

28:27.676 --> 28:30.844
I mean, my PTSD was
raging after my discharge.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.880
Look at these little guys.

28:32.913 --> 28:33.914
Easter bunnies.

28:33.948 --> 28:35.149
Nanny cams.

28:35.182 --> 28:37.552
I used them to film my
ex-girlfriend all the time.

28:37.586 --> 28:38.385
She was a nanny?

28:38.419 --> 28:39.820
No, I filmed her having sex.

28:39.853 --> 28:40.921
You made pornos with her?

28:40.955 --> 28:43.457
No, I wasn't in any of them.

28:43.490 --> 28:44.458
Can we change the subject?

28:44.491 --> 28:45.960
You mean, like she
changed sexual partners

28:45.993 --> 28:47.761
behind my back all the time?

28:47.795 --> 28:48.829
Maybe I should go.

28:48.862 --> 28:52.266
You haven't even met my
arsenal yet.

28:52.299 --> 28:53.568
Hey, arsenal.

28:55.302 --> 28:58.205
Wow, that's a lot of garden
tools.

28:58.239 --> 28:59.206
I know.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.475
I can't touch any weapons
since my incident.

29:01.509 --> 29:02.943
Well, except for this.

29:02.977 --> 29:04.011
Good enough for the Swiss
army...

29:04.044 --> 29:05.012
Good enough for me.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.113
Oh, and this.

29:07.081 --> 29:08.015
What the heck is that?

29:08.048 --> 29:09.283
My secret stake.

29:09.316 --> 29:10.184
I always carry it.

29:10.217 --> 29:11.118
You didn't have it before.

29:11.151 --> 29:12.886
Yes, I did, it was just a
secret.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.623
I thought we agreed
no hurting or killing,

29:14.656 --> 29:15.724
and that includes staking.

29:15.756 --> 29:18.225
We did, and this is a secret.

29:18.259 --> 29:20.294
Lose it or you'll be on your
own.

29:20.327 --> 29:22.429
Or worse, with that guy.

29:24.932 --> 29:26.433
No, you can't claim the ferret

29:26.467 --> 29:29.370
if it doesn't do work for you,
mom.

29:31.238 --> 29:32.806
Hey, guys.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.941
Hey, Terry.

29:35.309 --> 29:36.910
Great, so no more vampires.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.946
Oh, no, they're still here.

29:38.979 --> 29:40.214
Give me a break, Hawk.

29:40.247 --> 29:41.282
You know what, Arnold?

29:41.315 --> 29:43.384
Next time I see one, I'll
rip its damn head off

29:43.417 --> 29:44.818
and give it to you in a bag.

29:44.852 --> 29:48.322
As long as you're not late,
that's cool.

29:48.355 --> 29:49.591
Hey, hold it right there!

29:49.624 --> 29:50.924
See, I told you!

29:50.958 --> 29:55.062
Oh, no, wait, that's just
Rev, the groundskeeper.

29:55.095 --> 29:56.665
You shouldn't sneak around
like that.

29:56.698 --> 29:59.199
Yeah, I was just trying
to find the light switch.

29:59.233 --> 30:01.503
Is that a cape you're wearing?

30:01.536 --> 30:02.604
That is correct.

30:02.637 --> 30:04.138
Go home to your wives, Arnold.

30:04.171 --> 30:05.005
Wife!

30:05.039 --> 30:05.806
Whatever.

30:05.839 --> 30:06.907
I got this.

30:06.940 --> 30:10.110
All right, just stay out of
trouble.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.684
I thought you said to come
suited up.

30:15.717 --> 30:17.818
Yeah, not in the uniform of
our enemy.

30:17.851 --> 30:19.420
Capes are also worn by
superheroes.

30:19.453 --> 30:21.221
Take it off!

30:21.255 --> 30:23.857
What the hell is this?

30:23.891 --> 30:24.793
Anchor.

30:24.825 --> 30:25.993
I thought we could use it for
grappling.

30:26.026 --> 30:29.664
I can't wait to grapple
the hell out of a vampire.

30:29.698 --> 30:31.165
No, no, no.

30:31.198 --> 30:32.833
Grappling as in climbing.

30:32.866 --> 30:34.803
But can I still grapple
a vampire head with it?

30:34.835 --> 30:36.136
No.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.505
Fine, keep it.

30:38.405 --> 30:39.306
Hey, Rev.

30:39.340 --> 30:40.407
Yeah, Hawk?

30:40.441 --> 30:43.177
You know what time it is?

30:43.210 --> 30:44.144
7:30-ish?

30:45.846 --> 30:47.081
There's no sun in here.

30:47.114 --> 30:47.981
Negative.

30:48.015 --> 30:49.350
It's beast time.

30:50.217 --> 30:52.286
You know, like go time.

30:52.319 --> 30:54.254
Like time to pay the piper.

30:54.288 --> 30:56.524
Like I'm too old for this shit.

30:56.558 --> 30:58.760
Like you're gonna need a bigger
boat.

30:58.793 --> 31:00.894
Like always bet on black.

31:00.928 --> 31:03.698
Like after fucking your
wife, I'll have two more.

31:03.732 --> 31:07.034
Like you're the disease and I'm
the cure!

31:07.067 --> 31:10.037
Like I'm mad as hell and
I'm not gonna take it!

31:10.070 --> 31:11.472
Like I'll be back.

31:11.506 --> 31:14.341
Like go ahead, make my day,
punk!

31:14.375 --> 31:16.276
Like here's Johnny!

31:16.310 --> 31:17.144
Huh?

31:17.177 --> 31:19.313
Like yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker.

31:19.346 --> 31:20.682
Wax on, wax off.

31:21.816 --> 31:23.518
I feel the need for speed.

31:23.551 --> 31:24.719
Adrian!

31:24.753 --> 31:26.253
I see dead people.

31:27.454 --> 31:29.758
No one puts Baby in the corner!

31:29.791 --> 31:31.024
Like Free Willy.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.926
- No, never mind.
- I like that one.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.994
- I like that one.
- No.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.730
I can't believe you
don't know any of those.

31:35.764 --> 31:36.564
Any of what?

31:36.598 --> 31:37.398
Any of those lines.

31:37.431 --> 31:38.633
You never seen a movie?

31:38.666 --> 31:40.668
Those are from movies?

31:44.773 --> 31:45.874

Okay, we need a rope.

32:13.167 --> 32:14.134
I got the anchor.

32:14.168 --> 32:15.570
I thought you said you
were gonna bring a rope.

32:15.603 --> 32:16.838
You told me to bring the
anchor.

32:16.871 --> 32:17.971
Goddammit, Rev.

32:18.005 --> 32:19.707
Now one of us has to go back.

32:19.741 --> 32:21.308
It's not good to split up.

32:21.341 --> 32:24.411
Why don't I set up the nanny
cams and you can practice

32:24.445 --> 32:26.380
your army special ops
moves on the way back?

32:26.413 --> 32:27.214
You know what?

32:27.247 --> 32:28.382
I got a better idea.

32:28.415 --> 32:31.151
Why don't I go and practice
my army special ops moves

32:31.185 --> 32:33.888
and you set up those nanny cams.

32:33.922 --> 32:34.889
Well, I just said that.

32:34.923 --> 32:36.323
No, you didn't.

32:42.664 --> 32:44.566
Six seconds and counting,
cheetah one-nine.

32:44.599 --> 32:45.733
Any developments, over?

32:45.767 --> 32:47.367
No, all's well, honey
badger.

32:47.401 --> 32:48.202
Copy that.

32:48.235 --> 32:49.336
Over and out.

32:52.740 --> 32:55.309
Honey badger, of all the
nanny cams in the world,

32:55.342 --> 32:56.945
why Easter bunnies?

32:56.977 --> 32:58.378
Two reasons, cheetah
one-nine.

32:58.412 --> 33:00.548
One, it's the only
mainstream religious holiday

33:00.582 --> 33:01.783
that celebrates zombies.

33:01.816 --> 33:04.819
And two, my ex-girlfriend
had an Easter fetish.

33:04.853 --> 33:07.589
If you only knew where those
things have been, over.

33:07.622 --> 33:09.891
That is disgusting, over.

33:12.727 --> 33:15.262
Okay, vampire or werewolf?

33:15.295 --> 33:16.263
Werewolf.

33:16.296 --> 33:18.098
But vampires live
forever.

33:18.131 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, but werewolves have more
sex.

33:20.033 --> 33:22.035
Okay, mermaid or siren?

33:22.069 --> 33:24.037
Siren, male siren, of course.

33:24.071 --> 33:25.038
Come on.

33:25.072 --> 33:26.741
Merpeople are amphibious.

33:26.774 --> 33:30.110
Yeah, but male sirens
have shitloads of sex

33:30.143 --> 33:31.913
and all they have to do is sing
for it.

33:31.946 --> 33:33.815
Okay, Big Foot or Yeti?

33:33.848 --> 33:35.182
Big Foot, obviously.

33:35.215 --> 33:37.852
Ah, but Yetis could
live in the Arctic cold

33:37.886 --> 33:39.019
and not freeze to death.

33:39.052 --> 33:41.789
Yeah, but Big Foots
live in nice, warm forests

33:41.823 --> 33:43.992
where they have buttloads of
sex, over.

33:44.024 --> 33:46.093
You really need
a girlfriend, Hawk.

33:46.126 --> 33:48.428
That's a 10-4, little buddy.

33:48.462 --> 33:50.297
Holy shit, we've got company.

33:50.330 --> 33:51.131
Mayday, mayday!

33:51.164 --> 33:52.000
Abort, abort!

33:52.032 --> 33:52.834
What's going on down there?

33:52.867 --> 33:53.668
Mayday, mayday!

33:53.701 --> 33:54.602
Honey badger, come in.

33:54.636 --> 33:55.435
Abort the mission!

33:55.469 --> 33:56.270
Honey badger!

33:56.303 --> 33:59.072
Abort the mission,
over!

34:25.399 --> 34:28.402
Honey badger, are you alive,
over?

34:29.504 --> 34:31.338
Honey badger, come in.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.578
I'm in the dumpster
below, cheetah one-nine, over.

34:36.611 --> 34:38.412
Honey badger, I thought
they got you, over.

34:38.445 --> 34:39.446
I kinda wish they had.

34:39.479 --> 34:42.016
It smells like 10 dead
hookers in here, over.

34:42.050 --> 34:43.618
Better than the Easter
bunnies, over.

34:43.651 --> 34:45.053
10-4, cheetah one-nine.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.320
Is the coast clear, over?

34:46.353 --> 34:47.454
Hang tight.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.994
Honey badger, the coast is
most definitely not clear.

34:53.027 --> 34:54.662
You've got a bogey flying in
over.

34:54.696 --> 34:55.830
Come again, over.

34:55.863 --> 34:57.765
Honey badger, you've
got a vamp on you in five.

34:57.799 --> 34:58.633
Oh, crap.

34:58.666 --> 35:00.200
Should I get him with a garden
trowel?

35:00.233 --> 35:01.603
No, camouflage yourself.

35:01.636 --> 35:02.604
Four.

35:02.637 --> 35:03.905
Blast him with the holy water?

35:03.938 --> 35:05.472
You're running out of
time, buddy.

35:05.506 --> 35:06.440
Three.

35:06.473 --> 35:07.709
Should I hit him with my
secret stake?

35:07.742 --> 35:09.409
I thought we agreed no secret
stake.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.243
Two.

35:10.277 --> 35:11.512
We did, but it's a secret.

35:11.546 --> 35:12.981
Hey, one!

35:23.591 --> 35:25.927
Hey, look at this.

35:32.767 --> 35:37.605
Somebody left a perfectly
good hand bulb planting tool.

35:37.639 --> 35:39.741
Well, that's great.

35:39.774 --> 35:41.141
We can finally plant all those
tulip bulbs

35:41.174 --> 35:43.611
you got in Holland, Forneus.

35:43.645 --> 35:44.579
Give me a hand with this one.

35:44.612 --> 35:45.647
It's gonna take all of us.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.415
It's all those damn baby
heads.

36:05.432 --> 36:07.300
How's it looking
out there, cheetah one-nine.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.235
Hold position.

36:08.268 --> 36:09.771
They're almost clear.

36:09.804 --> 36:10.805
Copy that.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.809
What'd throw at me, over?

36:18.713 --> 36:22.016
Oh, dear God!

36:23.316 --> 36:24.118
Oh, my God!

36:24.152 --> 36:25.787
Somebody get me outta here!

36:25.820 --> 36:26.621
Help!

36:26.654 --> 36:27.454
Help!

36:28.556 --> 36:30.457
I can't believe that
son of a bitch vampire

36:30.490 --> 36:32.459
stole my mom's hand bulb
planter.

36:32.492 --> 36:34.562
She's gonna be so pissed.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.765
Hey, good morning, fellas.

36:37.799 --> 36:38.700
You're up early.

36:38.733 --> 36:40.134
As are you, deputy.

36:40.168 --> 36:42.070
Out running lives already, I
see.

36:42.103 --> 36:43.370
Just doing my job.

36:43.403 --> 36:44.706
As are we.

36:44.739 --> 36:47.374
Hmm, so your job is, what,

36:47.407 --> 36:50.511
ninja warrior and Karate Kid
lookalike?

36:50.545 --> 36:51.913
Oh, no.

36:51.946 --> 36:55.382
Yeah, no, we're, it was
dress up day at work.

36:55.415 --> 36:56.951
Yeah, casual Friday.

36:56.984 --> 36:59.419
So you steal all this stuff?

36:59.453 --> 37:00.855
Oh, these old things?

37:00.888 --> 37:03.958
No, we had a charity drive at
work.

37:03.991 --> 37:05.827
So you stole all this
from the charity drive.

37:05.860 --> 37:06.761
No, of course not.

37:06.794 --> 37:07.829
That would be...

37:07.862 --> 37:08.730
Uncharitable?

37:08.763 --> 37:09.731
Exactly.

37:09.764 --> 37:13.534
No, we're transporting
them to a, a hospital.

37:14.702 --> 37:15.503
A hospital.

37:15.536 --> 37:17.772
Which one, specifically?

37:17.805 --> 37:20.208
Oh, you know, it's the one
down,

37:20.240 --> 37:21.374
you know the one.

37:21.408 --> 37:22.577
No, I don't.

37:22.610 --> 37:25.046
It's the one for kids with,

37:27.715 --> 37:28.716
with cancer.

37:30.752 --> 37:33.888
There's a hospital just
for kids with cancer.

37:33.921 --> 37:36.190
Oh, yeah, and it's packed
to the gills with them.

37:36.224 --> 37:39.093
And they're all dying,
all the kids, all of them,

37:39.127 --> 37:41.428
just dropping like
disease-ridden flies

37:41.461 --> 37:43.396
from all the festering.

37:43.430 --> 37:44.232
The cancer.

37:44.264 --> 37:46.601
Yeah, it's a real tragedy.

37:50.705 --> 37:51.539
I, uh,

37:53.975 --> 37:54.776
it's really nice of you guys.

37:54.809 --> 37:56.978
I didn't, it's unexpected.

37:57.812 --> 38:00.515
What about these gardening
tools?

38:00.548 --> 38:03.017
Oh, gardening for the kids
with all the festering...

38:03.050 --> 38:03.818
The cancer.

38:03.851 --> 38:05.253
That's right.

38:05.285 --> 38:06.419
Gardening for cancer.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.588
Yeah.

38:07.622 --> 38:10.457
You guys, you keep up
all the good work, huh.

38:10.490 --> 38:11.826
You too, deputy.

38:11.859 --> 38:12.894
I will.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.595
You take care now.

38:15.530 --> 38:16.329
I'm sorry.

38:16.363 --> 38:17.397
It was either cancer or AIDS.

38:17.430 --> 38:20.268
I figured cancer was more
believable.

38:59.807 --> 39:01.441
No, no, no, that was not me

39:01.474 --> 39:03.711
who just called and hung up on
you twice.

I don't know.

39:08.216 --> 39:11.152

something?

39:12.587 --> 39:13.420
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:13.453 --> 39:15.523
That is a weird thing to say to
a girl.

39:15.556 --> 39:17.725

We gotta shred it up
San Muerte style, right?

39:30.872 --> 39:31.973
Okay, man.

39:32.006 --> 39:32.807
All right.

39:37.845 --> 39:40.982
Hey, I know you barneys
are up to something.

39:41.015 --> 39:42.683
It's not funny, man!

39:44.185 --> 39:47.855
Barneys, man.

39:50.091 --> 39:53.194
Dude, I swear, I'm gonna
tell Tegan and Brody, man.

39:53.227 --> 39:54.161

39:54.195 --> 39:57.531
they're gonna Tegan and Brody

40:06.374 --> 40:07.440
I don't know where you think you
are,

40:07.474 --> 40:08.676
but this ain't your break!

40:08.709 --> 40:11.379
Go back to your own break, kook.

40:13.948 --> 40:15.750
That's what I thought.

40:20.588 --> 40:21.589
God dang it!

40:34.568 --> 40:37.470
Wow, I've never been booty
called to a tent before.

40:37.505 --> 40:39.573
You're welcome, little lady.

40:39.607 --> 40:41.275
You want some cowboy coffee?

40:41.309 --> 40:42.109
Hey, Terry.

40:42.143 --> 40:43.110
Hey, Hawk.

40:45.846 --> 40:48.082
So this is all temporary,
right?

40:48.115 --> 40:49.283
Oh, yeah.

40:49.317 --> 40:51.852
I mean, I stayed with my folks
right after my discharge.

40:51.886 --> 40:53.387
I had a little PTSD.

40:53.421 --> 40:54.889
And we didn't get along so well,

40:54.922 --> 40:57.024
but I'm looking for a place.

40:57.058 --> 40:59.160
Where were you stationed?

40:59.193 --> 41:00.828
Mostly Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas.

41:00.861 --> 41:01.996
Where the prison is, right?

41:02.029 --> 41:03.264
Yeah, I was in a bad, bad
place,

41:03.297 --> 41:05.099
but, you know, I'm all better
now.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.267
Wait, you were in the prison?

41:06.300 --> 41:07.835
Yeah, the army doesn't
like you driving stakes

41:07.868 --> 41:10.204
through its privates, and by
that, I mean Private Dirkman.

41:10.237 --> 41:12.606
He was a vampire, by the way.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.607
Are you taking notes?

41:13.641 --> 41:14.575
I am a writer.

41:14.608 --> 41:15.743
That's what we do.

41:15.776 --> 41:18.478
Am I like the star of your
book?

41:18.512 --> 41:19.680
Hard to say.

41:21.082 --> 41:21.916
Maybe.

41:23.250 --> 41:24.418
You think she's a double
agent?

41:24.452 --> 41:27.188
I think she was definitely
pumping me for information.

41:27.221 --> 41:28.589
I think you should be so
lucky.

41:28.622 --> 41:30.791
I think she was the
lucky one in that scenario.

41:30.825 --> 41:33.828
I pumped her right back,
not for information though.

41:33.861 --> 41:34.962
Thanks for that, Hawk.

41:34.996 --> 41:36.197
I had sex with her,
Rev.

41:36.230 --> 41:37.264
Yeah, I got it.

41:37.298 --> 41:38.733
Okay, stop, too far.

41:38.766 --> 41:40.434
Let's back it up.

41:40.468 --> 41:41.402
Back it up.

41:41.435 --> 41:42.903
Let's go.

41:42.937 --> 41:44.105
I had sex with her, Rev.

41:44.138 --> 41:45.439
Yeah, I got it.

41:45.473 --> 41:47.008
In her vagina hole.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.809
I don't wanna know about
it.

41:48.843 --> 41:49.910
Okay, this is it.

41:49.944 --> 41:50.745
I got it.

41:50.778 --> 41:51.612
Foot it.

41:51.645 --> 41:52.980
I know how to work a ladder,
Hawk.

41:53.014 --> 41:53.848
Okay.

41:56.083 --> 41:56.884
After you, sir.

41:56.917 --> 41:57.718
Oh, no, no, no.

41:57.752 --> 41:58.552
You first.

41:58.586 --> 41:59.620
I would rather you
went.

41:59.653 --> 42:00.988
My mother taught
me to be a gentleman.

42:01.022 --> 42:01.889
Just go, please.

42:01.922 --> 42:02.723
- No.
- Just go!

42:02.757 --> 42:03.557
No!

42:03.591 --> 42:04.392
- Go!
- No!

42:04.425 --> 42:05.226
- Go!
- No!

42:05.259 --> 42:06.093
Yes!

42:09.363 --> 42:10.431
Move it.

42:10.464 --> 42:12.600
We've got nanny cams to
place and vampires to catch.

42:12.633 --> 42:13.434
I mean, to stake.

42:13.467 --> 42:14.502
I mean, no, to catch.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.303
One, step into position.

42:16.337 --> 42:18.139
Two, scan the perimeter.

42:18.172 --> 42:20.007
Three, pick an enemy.

42:20.041 --> 42:22.109
Four, strike up conversation.

42:22.143 --> 42:24.278
Five, ready your pitchfork.

42:24.311 --> 42:25.112
And six...

42:25.146 --> 42:26.447
Wait, I have a question.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.350
Number four, the conversation,
can you explain that a bit?

42:29.383 --> 42:31.285
Yes, you strike up
conversation

42:31.318 --> 42:33.354
so they let down their guard.

42:33.387 --> 42:35.122
I usually go with something like
this.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.625
Hey, fucking corpse face.

42:37.658 --> 42:39.960
Yeah, I'm talking to you, blood
shitbag.

42:39.994 --> 42:42.997
I hear you wanna eat nice
innocent Americans for dinner.

42:43.030 --> 42:44.065
Oh, yeah?

42:44.098 --> 42:47.902
Well, not on my watch,
bloodsucking vampire scum!

42:47.935 --> 42:53.007
Take that, you
filthy ass blood sucker!

42:53.040 --> 42:55.242
New rule, no weapons.

42:55.276 --> 42:56.444
Vampires, huh?

42:56.477 --> 42:58.412
Oh, yeah, there are shit tons
of 'em.

42:58.446 --> 42:59.313
What about werewolves?

42:59.346 --> 43:01.148
Oh, yeah, they're a big
problem too,

43:01.182 --> 43:03.751
just roaming around in
packs, eating livestock,

43:03.784 --> 43:05.052
pissing everywhere.

43:05.086 --> 43:07.888
Filthy goddamn creatures.

43:07.922 --> 43:08.989
Yes.

43:09.023 --> 43:09.924
Absolutely.

43:09.957 --> 43:10.825
No.

43:10.858 --> 43:11.659
Yes.

43:11.692 --> 43:12.593
Maybe?

43:12.626 --> 43:13.794
Yes.

43:13.828 --> 43:14.795
No.

43:14.829 --> 43:16.363
And hell yes.

43:16.397 --> 43:18.399
Hey, have you ever gotten
your chromosomes checked?

43:18.432 --> 43:21.302
Is that like getting
your testicles checked?

43:21.335 --> 43:22.937
Look, about last night.

43:22.970 --> 43:24.872
If you tell anyone, it's
never gonna happen again.

43:24.905 --> 43:25.840
I mean, like never.

43:25.873 --> 43:26.674
Seriously?

43:26.707 --> 43:27.509
Seriously.

43:27.542 --> 43:28.342
Like not even Rev?

43:28.375 --> 43:29.410
Especially not Rev!

43:29.443 --> 43:32.079
Also, if I get pregnant,
I'm not keeping the baby.

43:32.113 --> 43:33.080
It would be irresponsible

43:33.114 --> 43:34.648
to bring your spawn into this
world.

43:34.682 --> 43:37.084
Well< I feel like it would
be irresponsible not to.

43:37.118 --> 43:38.085
I mean, who's gonna deal

43:38.119 --> 43:39.588
with all these supernatural
creatures

43:39.620 --> 43:41.722
dicking around in the world when
I'm gone?

43:41.755 --> 43:43.624
A bunch of baby Hawks, that's
who.

43:43.657 --> 43:47.194
Humanity's survival depends on
us.

43:47.228 --> 43:48.762
Nope, that's not happening.

43:48.796 --> 43:49.797
Sorry.

43:49.830 --> 43:50.698
Hey, wait up.

43:50.731 --> 43:52.433
Nope.

44:00.007 --> 44:00.808
Question.

44:00.841 --> 44:02.209
Why are we doing bird calls
again?

44:02.243 --> 44:03.978
Answer, your walkie dies.

44:04.011 --> 44:08.649
Why can't we just whistle?

44:09.783 --> 44:12.153
Whistling is most obviously
human, Rev.

44:12.186 --> 44:13.654
Even retards know that.

44:13.687 --> 44:15.055
That's highly insensitive,
Hawk.

44:15.089 --> 44:17.324
Not if you compare it to
getting your ass eaten alive

44:17.358 --> 44:20.194
by bloodsucking vampires it's
not.

44:21.428 --> 44:22.997
Can we try the scarlet warbler?

44:23.030 --> 44:24.398
Indeed.

44:32.039 --> 44:34.375
Are you going to the bathroom?

44:36.477 --> 44:37.278
What?

44:37.311 --> 44:38.312
I had to go!

44:43.184 --> 44:44.985
Are you all done in there?

44:45.019 --> 44:46.521
Back off, Terry.

44:51.125 --> 44:52.893
You know, I just, you know,

44:52.927 --> 44:56.931
I've been going through
this transformation.

44:56.964 --> 45:01.168
It hasn't been all cute and
cuddly, as you two know.

45:01.202 --> 45:04.705
Anyway, I'm really sorry about
the hassle.

45:05.607 --> 45:09.877
And you know, if you
two wanna give it a go,

45:09.910 --> 45:11.580
I'm game for it, so.

45:11.613 --> 45:15.584
Well, I think I speak for
both of us when I saw we're in

45:15.617 --> 45:17.985
just as long as we don't
have to get naked again.

45:18.018 --> 45:19.654
No, no more nudity.

45:19.688 --> 45:22.456
I mean, unless you wanna do it.

45:22.489 --> 45:23.625
Oh, no, no.

45:23.658 --> 45:24.858
No, no.

45:24.892 --> 45:29.730
Well, in the spirit of all
this newfound reconciliation...

45:34.235 --> 45:35.035
What is that?

45:35.069 --> 45:35.869
What is what?

45:35.903 --> 45:36.705
Huh?

45:36.737 --> 45:40.241
I can feel my skull.

45:40.274 --> 45:43.110
The voices in my head, in the
sky.

45:45.312 --> 45:47.381
Bats, they're coming.

45:47.414 --> 45:48.717
Go in.

45:48.749 --> 45:50.451
They're everywhere!

45:50.484 --> 45:51.653
It's the end of the world!

45:51.686 --> 45:53.120
We're all doomed!

45:55.389 --> 45:56.323
We're all gonna die!

45:56.357 --> 45:57.191
Run!

46:06.300 --> 46:07.101
Wow.

46:07.134 --> 46:07.968
Whoa.

46:11.305 --> 46:13.374
♪ Have you ever met this lady ♪

46:13.407 --> 46:14.241
That's the way to do it.

46:14.275 --> 46:15.876
Come to papa, baby.

46:17.411 --> 46:18.245
Oh.

46:19.113 --> 46:19.947
Oh, yeah.

46:21.448 --> 46:22.349
Oh, uh-huh.

46:26.621 --> 46:30.090
What, what's happening?

46:38.265 --> 46:40.635
♪ Have you ever seen this lady ♪

46:40.669 --> 46:41.902
♪ She likes to dance ♪

46:41.935 --> 46:42.836
Oh, there we go.

46:42.870 --> 46:44.706
Oh, nope, sorry about that.

46:44.739 --> 46:46.807
It got a little lonely at hobo
camp.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.243
Anyway, orange or grape soda?

46:49.276 --> 46:50.210
I don't drink that stuff.

46:50.244 --> 46:51.278
Chicharrones?

46:51.312 --> 46:52.112
No, I'm a vegan.

46:52.146 --> 46:52.946
So?

46:52.980 --> 46:54.415
So I don't eat fried pig skin.

46:54.448 --> 46:56.483
You vegans are all so angry.

46:56.518 --> 46:57.851
We just don't eat animals.

46:57.885 --> 47:00.421
I'd like to make a toast.

47:00.454 --> 47:04.526
To us, to the mission, and
to kicking mucho vampire ass.

47:04.559 --> 47:07.729
And to not staking, no
asphyxiation,

47:09.096 --> 47:10.297
and not getting arrested.

47:10.331 --> 47:12.534
To doing nothing fun to
vampires.

47:17.338 --> 47:18.807
Maybe they took the night off.

47:18.839 --> 47:20.274
They're vampires, Rev.

47:20.307 --> 47:22.443
They don't take nights off.

47:22.476 --> 47:23.977
They don't socialize.

47:24.011 --> 47:27.782
They focus on one thing
and only one thing.

47:27.816 --> 47:28.817
Murder.

47:28.849 --> 47:30.150
I thought they did this for
food.

47:30.184 --> 47:31.852
Sure, but at the end of every
night,

47:31.885 --> 47:33.454
there's still a bunch of damn
murders.

47:33.487 --> 47:34.556
What about that pig

47:34.589 --> 47:36.457
that ave its life for your
chicharrones?

47:36.490 --> 47:37.491
Are you really comparing me

47:37.525 --> 47:39.927
to bloodsucking filthy
ass vampires right now?

47:39.960 --> 47:43.063
All I'm saying is maybe
they do other things besides...

47:43.097 --> 47:43.897
Oh, really?

47:43.931 --> 47:44.766
Like what?

47:44.799 --> 47:47.067
I don't know, like candle-lit
dinners,

47:47.101 --> 47:49.470
long walks on the beach,
going to the library,

47:49.504 --> 47:52.406
visit an amusement park,
skip with their friends,

47:52.439 --> 47:55.008
play hopscotch, collect turtles,

47:55.042 --> 47:57.277
watch butterflies in the summer
evenings.

47:57.311 --> 48:02.316
Imagine how many books you
could read if you live forever.

48:04.519 --> 48:06.320
You just know how to
ruin things, don't you?

48:06.353 --> 48:07.221
This is so boring.

48:07.254 --> 48:08.989
I just wanna stab a vampire.

48:09.022 --> 48:11.024
I mean, catch a vampire.

48:23.337 --> 48:24.304
Get off me, Rev.

48:24.338 --> 48:25.139
Get off!

48:25.172 --> 48:25.973
Get off me.

48:26.006 --> 48:26.940
God!

48:26.974 --> 48:27.842
What time is it?

48:27.876 --> 48:29.878
I don't know, late.

48:29.910 --> 48:30.911
I need to get to work.

48:30.944 --> 48:31.746
Whatever.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.414
I can't be partners with a
quitter.

48:33.447 --> 48:34.481
I have a job.

48:34.516 --> 48:35.916
Wait, look!

48:35.949 --> 48:38.285
Dude, I'm just saying,
they all taste different.

48:38.318 --> 48:39.353
Blood or the girls?

48:39.386 --> 48:41.088
Come to think of it, both.

48:41.121 --> 48:42.089
That is disgusting.

48:42.122 --> 48:43.357
Shit, that's nothing.

48:43.390 --> 48:44.224
Did I tell you about that time

48:44.258 --> 48:46.093
I hit the all lady biker gang?

48:47.327 --> 48:49.029
Oh, my God, this is so great.

48:49.062 --> 48:50.899
We're gonna hit those three
vampire birds

48:50.931 --> 48:53.835
with one kick ass vampire
slaying stone!

48:53.868 --> 48:55.202
Yeah, except there's two of
us.

48:55.235 --> 48:56.336
Yeah, so?

48:56.370 --> 48:57.572
So that saying doesn't work?

48:57.605 --> 48:58.405
Why?

48:58.439 --> 48:59.574
Because the odds are worse?

48:59.607 --> 49:00.974
No, the odds are better.

49:01.008 --> 49:02.476
It's just, you're missing the
point.

49:02.510 --> 49:03.711
Well, I feel like you're
looking at it

49:03.745 --> 49:05.513
with a glass half empty
attitude.

49:05.547 --> 49:07.549
And I think you don't
understand either saying.

49:07.582 --> 49:09.149
Well, I think you're a
quitter.

49:09.183 --> 49:10.217
I ain't quit!

49:10.250 --> 49:14.121
That's what all quitters
tell themselves, Rev.

49:32.841 --> 49:35.577
All right, I checked online
and it's our right as Americans

49:35.610 --> 49:38.813
to citizen's arrest their
filthy vampire asses.

49:38.847 --> 49:40.648
You got your ID?

49:40.682 --> 49:41.883
You know what this is?

49:41.916 --> 49:43.016
A cassette tape.

49:43.050 --> 49:45.285
Of the worst Christian
hard rock band ever recorded.

49:45.319 --> 49:47.922
It's so bad, even Christians
cry when they hear it.

49:47.956 --> 49:49.223
How do you know it
will work on vampires?

49:49.256 --> 49:50.257
I don't.

49:50.290 --> 49:52.459
Can I get the smoke bombs?

49:53.695 --> 49:54.596
You know, I'm sensing

49:54.629 --> 49:55.797
kind of a quitter vibe from you
right now.

49:55.830 --> 49:58.633
I really need you to quit
that shit right now, Rev

49:58.666 --> 50:00.067
and get pumped up.

50:00.100 --> 50:00.902
I'm pumped.

50:00.935 --> 50:01.769
You don't seem very pumped.

50:01.803 --> 50:02.770
I'm totally pumped.

50:02.804 --> 50:04.104
I need you really pumped!

50:04.137 --> 50:05.740
I'm super gosh darn pumped.

50:05.773 --> 50:07.374
The makeup looks great, by the
way.

50:07.407 --> 50:08.208
Oh, thanks.

50:08.242 --> 50:10.979
It's not makeup, it's
camouflage.

50:14.348 --> 50:16.851
Whoa, Forneus, take it easy.

50:27.962 --> 50:30.297
You guys expecting anyone?

50:39.439 --> 50:41.275
Hey, pizza delivery.

50:43.878 --> 50:46.313
Did you guys order a pizza?

50:50.852 --> 50:53.621
Well, somebody ordered a
pizza.

50:53.655 --> 50:55.557
Man, it might have been me.

50:55.590 --> 50:57.592
I got this new medicine.

50:59.126 --> 51:00.160
Smells good.

51:00.193 --> 51:02.564
You mind if I come in?

51:02.597 --> 51:03.397
Oh, yeah, yeah.

51:03.430 --> 51:05.332
Come on in, man.

51:05.365 --> 51:07.200
The more, the merrier.

51:18.078 --> 51:20.848
So how much do I owe you, my
man?

51:30.290 --> 51:33.795
You must think you're pretty
smart, huh,

51:33.828 --> 51:36.064
just invading my territory.

51:39.099 --> 51:43.504
No, I mean, there's
plenty of gigs to go around.

51:43.538 --> 51:47.709
Yeah, I mean, this whole area's
super happening right now.

51:47.742 --> 51:49.309
You know don't play dumb with
me.

51:49.343 --> 51:51.579
I know what you're doing,

51:51.613 --> 51:55.415
and I don't appreciate the
competition.

51:55.449 --> 51:56.416
Competition?

51:56.450 --> 51:58.720
We all have different sounds,
man.

51:58.753 --> 52:00.420
Yeah, I mean
that's what's so great

52:00.454 --> 52:02.523
about the music business.

52:11.198 --> 52:15.637
The only business I wanna
talk about is vampire business

52:15.670 --> 52:18.506
and how you're feeding in my
territory.

52:18.539 --> 52:19.707
Oh, God, please, don't kill
us.

52:19.741 --> 52:21.475
Take what you want.

52:23.911 --> 52:26.981
What kind of shit vampires are
you?

52:29.282 --> 52:31.284
Freeze, fang faces!

52:31.318 --> 52:34.254
Hands in the air,
vampires!

52:36.658 --> 52:38.158
Jasper?

52:38.191 --> 52:38.993
What's he doing here?

52:39.027 --> 52:39.827
Yeah.

52:39.861 --> 52:41.095
What the hell are you doing
here?

52:41.129 --> 52:42.563
I was just, you know,

52:42.597 --> 52:44.932
making sure the pool was clean
and secure

52:44.966 --> 52:46.668
before you boys jumped on in.

52:46.701 --> 52:47.501
Pool?

52:47.535 --> 52:48.335
What pool?

52:48.368 --> 52:49.169
There's a pool here?

52:49.202 --> 52:50.370
It's an analogy.

52:50.404 --> 52:52.840
I was being a good mentor,
you know, testing the waters,

52:52.874 --> 52:54.241
making sure it's safe.

52:54.274 --> 52:55.175
He's so nice.

52:55.208 --> 52:56.911
He just gets nicer every time we
meet him.

52:56.944 --> 52:58.012
Yeah, no problem.

52:58.046 --> 52:59.847
Anyway, go ahead and do your
thing.

52:59.881 --> 53:01.049
Do America proud, boys.

53:01.082 --> 53:02.116
We will!

53:02.150 --> 53:03.051
All right, vampires.

53:03.084 --> 53:05.086
You're under citizen's arrest!

53:05.119 --> 53:06.754
Oh, you are getting raped!

53:06.788 --> 53:07.588
Whoa!

53:07.622 --> 53:08.556
Easy, man.

53:08.589 --> 53:10.357
I'm gonna eat your
flesh and shit it out,

53:10.390 --> 53:11.993
and then I'm going to
fucking eat it again,

53:12.026 --> 53:13.027
you motherfuckers!

53:13.061 --> 53:14.962
I don't think we
talked about that at all.

53:14.996 --> 53:16.396
And then I'm gonna fuck your
ear!

53:16.430 --> 53:17.699
I'm gonna fuck it again!

53:17.732 --> 53:19.801
And I'm gonna fuck your
mother's ear and she's gonna die

53:19.834 --> 53:20.702
and you're gonna die with her,

53:20.735 --> 53:22.502
you vampire little pieces of
shit!

53:22.537 --> 53:23.938
I did not agree to any of
that.

53:23.971 --> 53:27.175
And I'm gonna poop on your
fucking face, you little fucks.

53:27.207 --> 53:29.110
You wanna fucking get some of
this?

53:29.143 --> 53:31.679
Oh my gosh, he's gonna
kill us!

53:31.713 --> 53:33.548
He has a weapon.

53:33.581 --> 53:34.716
Break the door!

53:34.749 --> 53:36.584
Hawk, break the fucking door!

53:41.889 --> 53:42.690
What is it?

53:42.724 --> 53:43.524
Where am I?

53:43.558 --> 53:44.458
Easy, buddy.

53:44.491 --> 53:45.225
You just, you just hit your
little head.

53:45.258 --> 53:46.094
What?

53:46.127 --> 53:47.461
Relax, these guys are on our
side.

53:47.494 --> 53:48.896
But they're vampires.

53:48.930 --> 53:50.131
Uh, no, no.

53:50.164 --> 53:51.899
They're just a goth band.

53:51.933 --> 53:53.801
Crypts and Sorrows of
Darkness.

53:53.835 --> 53:54.869
I came up with the name

53:54.902 --> 53:56.838
during a vision quest
to Romania with Forneus.

53:56.871 --> 53:58.072
But what about the black
eyes,

53:58.106 --> 54:00.407
the blood, the gimp, and 201?

54:00.440 --> 54:02.910
Oh, contact lenses, pig blood.

54:02.944 --> 54:05.713
The gimp is a submissive of this
guy here.

54:05.747 --> 54:07.882
And management neglected to tell
us

54:07.915 --> 54:09.150
they rented it out again.

54:09.183 --> 54:09.984
Oh.

54:10.017 --> 54:10.818
It's all legal.

54:10.852 --> 54:12.019
And avante.

54:12.053 --> 54:13.453
Oh, and one more thing.

54:13.487 --> 54:14.287
Yeah?

54:14.321 --> 54:15.556
Our lone wolf mentor,

54:15.590 --> 54:17.558
he's a filthy ass vampire!

54:17.592 --> 54:19.359
Holy farts.

54:30.571 --> 54:32.372
You think we should wear
these on our backs too

54:32.405 --> 54:33.207
just in case?

54:33.241 --> 54:34.242
Yeah, it wouldn't hurt.

54:34.274 --> 54:35.076
Here, let me get that for you.

54:35.109 --> 54:35.943
No.

54:35.977 --> 54:37.344
No way you're getting behind me,
mister.

54:37.377 --> 54:39.247
You tried to eat that goth band.

54:39.279 --> 54:40.681
I just lost it, okay?

54:40.715 --> 54:41.516
Give me a break.

54:41.549 --> 54:42.717
Okay.

54:42.750 --> 54:45.019
If you try anything.

54:45.052 --> 54:45.987
Dang it, Hawk.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.822
I thought we agreed, no more
secret stake.

54:47.855 --> 54:48.656
We did.

54:48.689 --> 54:49.489
But you brought it.

54:49.524 --> 54:50.792
Nope, it's a secret.

54:50.825 --> 54:51.659
Yeah, but it's right there.

54:51.692 --> 54:54.128
No, back to being a secret.

55:03.571 --> 55:04.872
Fine.

55:04.906 --> 55:06.073
Hey, guys.

55:06.107 --> 55:07.875
I think we can catch Jasper
in this without killing him.

55:07.909 --> 55:09.577
What is that, a shiny
butterfly net?

55:09.610 --> 55:12.246
No, it's a vampire trap,
actually,

55:12.280 --> 55:14.347
made of silver-plated aircraft
cable.

55:14.381 --> 55:15.448
According to legend,

55:15.482 --> 55:16.918
silver was the only
naturally occurring substance

55:16.951 --> 55:18.653
that could injure a vampire.

55:18.686 --> 55:20.721
Drop him in this and he's
helpless.

55:20.755 --> 55:25.760
Guys,.

55:25.793 --> 55:27.460
It's almost sundown.

55:28.563 --> 55:30.330

I'm not a hippie, Hawk.

Oh, better watch out.

56:25.418 --> 56:26.821
Did you just give me a code
name?

56:26.854 --> 56:27.822
I did.

56:27.855 --> 56:28.789
We know her well.

56:28.823 --> 56:29.857
Foxy indeed.

56:29.891 --> 56:31.826
Not to mention fiery.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.762
Wait, you guys know each
other?

56:34.795 --> 56:39.432
Yeah, it was like a,
kinda polyamorous thing.

What do we do if he answers
the door?

57:17.104 --> 57:19.941
Well, normally, I'd say rip
his goddamn vampire head off,

57:19.974 --> 57:22.576
but that'd be against our rules
of engagement, wouldn't it?

57:22.610 --> 57:24.612
You guys have rules of
engagement?

57:24.645 --> 57:27.415
Rev wouldn't join my mission
till I agreed to 'em all.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.481
It's our mission.

57:28.516 --> 57:30.318
And I just thought it'd be
good not to hurt or kill

57:30.351 --> 57:32.386
and then get help and not get
arrested.

57:32.420 --> 57:34.388
That sounds pretty logical to
me.

57:34.422 --> 57:37.490
You two are perfect for each
other.

57:40.227 --> 57:41.329
All right, army special ops

57:41.362 --> 57:43.364
trained me to deal with delicate
matters.

57:43.397 --> 57:46.233
I will do the talking, okay?

57:46.267 --> 57:47.068
Can I help you?

57:47.101 --> 57:47.902
That depends.

57:47.935 --> 57:49.502
Where the hell is your son?

57:49.537 --> 57:51.639
Sorry, what is this in regards
to?

57:51.672 --> 57:53.140
What's the goddamn difference,
lady?

57:53.174 --> 57:56.711
Is this filthy bloodsucking
vampire ass here or what?

57:56.744 --> 57:58.312
We need to ask him some
questions.

57:58.346 --> 57:59.213
Excuse me.

57:59.246 --> 58:00.715
No, excuse him, ma'am.

58:00.748 --> 58:03.117
Besides being extremely rude,
what he forgot to mention

58:03.150 --> 58:04.685
is that we work with Jasper.

58:04.719 --> 58:06.120
Yeah, we're his coworkers.

58:06.153 --> 58:07.321
His work friends.

58:07.355 --> 58:10.224
I'm so pleased to
finally meet some of you.

58:10.257 --> 58:11.592
He doesn't have a lot of
friends.

58:11.625 --> 58:13.627
Oh, that's a big fucking
surprise.

58:13.661 --> 58:14.795
Just ignore him, ma'am.

58:14.829 --> 58:16.130
We all do.

58:16.163 --> 58:18.065
Well, I haven't seen
him since last night.

58:18.099 --> 58:19.300
He left saying

58:19.333 --> 58:22.870
that he was going to assess
the competition or something.

58:22.903 --> 58:24.105
But if there isn't anything
else,

58:24.138 --> 58:26.007
I have a casserole in the oven.

58:26.040 --> 58:29.110
No, ma'am, I'm real sorry
I was so short earlier.

58:29.143 --> 58:32.079
Jasper borrowed this DVD
I rented a while back.

58:32.113 --> 58:34.215
You can still do that, rent
DVDs?

58:34.248 --> 58:36.083
Yeah, of course you can still
do that.

58:36.117 --> 58:37.752
They also charge hella late
fees.

58:37.785 --> 58:39.520
So can we look for it in his
room or...

58:39.553 --> 58:40.654
Which one was it again?

58:40.688 --> 58:41.722
From Dusk till Dawn.

58:41.756 --> 58:43.657
Oh, that vampire movie

58:43.691 --> 58:46.427
with that handsome doctor fella
from TV.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.196
Yeah, it's his favorite, and
the director trying to act.

58:49.230 --> 58:50.031
Yeah.

58:50.064 --> 58:50.965
Well, I'd check the garage.

58:50.998 --> 58:52.700
It's where he's been sleeping
most days.

58:52.733 --> 58:54.935
He's been complaining about
migraines,

58:54.969 --> 58:57.038
can't be in the light.

58:57.071 --> 59:00.107
I don't understand what's going
on.

59:00.141 --> 59:04.145
He was also the
Batman with the nipples.

59:09.383 --> 59:12.019
Geez, talk about frightening.

59:12.053 --> 59:15.423
I bet he's got a whole
coffin of human heads in here.

59:15.456 --> 59:17.024
Don't they sleep in coffins.

59:17.058 --> 59:18.926
Who's to say they
don't snack in them too?

59:18.959 --> 59:20.261
I would.

59:20.294 --> 59:22.229
Gross, you'd get bugs.

59:22.263 --> 59:23.532
He's a vampire, Rev.

59:23.564 --> 59:27.401
They don't give two shits about
bugs.

59:27.435 --> 59:28.803
How'd you know about the DVD?

59:28.836 --> 59:31.005
We were bunkmates in cell
block nine.

59:31.038 --> 59:33.808
It was either watch his favorite
DVD or...

59:33.841 --> 59:35.109
No, I don't wanna know.

59:35.142 --> 59:37.144
Yeah, yeah, you don't.

59:38.079 --> 59:40.848
Hey, guys, look at this.

59:40.881 --> 59:43.518
Who needs this many blood bags?

59:43.552 --> 59:46.487
Same guy who does all this.

59:46.521 --> 59:48.523
Maybe he's just doing a lot of
drugs.

59:48.557 --> 59:50.624
It does kinda Look
like a meth lab in here.

59:50.658 --> 59:52.493
How many meth labs
have you been in, Rev?

59:52.527 --> 59:53.727
Seven.

59:53.761 --> 59:55.029
No,

59:55.062 --> 59:55.896
eight.

59:56.797 --> 59:59.467
Holy shit, guys, look at this.

1:00:00.535 --> 1:00:02.636
Whoa, it's like A Beautiful
Mind.

1:00:02.670 --> 1:00:05.739
Yeah, but ugly as shit!

1:00:05.773 --> 1:00:09.243
I wonder how many cats
he stole this yarn from.

1:00:09.276 --> 1:00:11.178
Oh, my God, look at that
little guy.

1:00:11.212 --> 1:00:12.012
Come on, Hawk.

1:00:12.046 --> 1:00:12.847
This is serious.

1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:13.681
I know, Rev.

1:00:13.714 --> 1:00:15.282
Look what he's sitting on.

1:00:15.316 --> 1:00:17.751
It's a blueprint for the
city's water filtration plant.

1:00:17.785 --> 1:00:19.588
Look, here's the well.

1:00:19.620 --> 1:00:20.421
What?

1:00:20.454 --> 1:00:21.255
How do you know that?

1:00:21.288 --> 1:00:22.256
I used to work there.

1:00:22.289 --> 1:00:23.824
They fired me 'cause I
tried to excise a demon

1:00:23.858 --> 1:00:25.426
from a day shift manager.

1:00:25.459 --> 1:00:27.795
Well, they probably
didn't want all that blood

1:00:27.828 --> 1:00:29.330
near the city's clean water.

1:00:31.198 --> 1:00:32.399
He's gonna poison the well.

1:00:32.433 --> 1:00:37.371
And create an army of filthy
ass vampires in the process.

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:42.109
What, what are you looking at?

1:00:43.010 --> 1:00:43.811
Bye!

1:00:43.844 --> 1:00:44.778
Bye.

1:00:44.812 --> 1:00:46.313
We really need to call the
cops.

1:00:46.347 --> 1:00:47.214
We already did.

1:00:47.248 --> 1:00:48.517
Trust me, they won't even
believe us.

1:00:48.550 --> 1:00:49.518
Yeah, they really won't.

1:00:49.551 --> 1:00:50.651
Okay, well, then I'll call.

1:00:50.684 --> 1:00:51.819
No, they'll still think it's
me.

1:00:51.852 --> 1:00:52.887
Yeah, they really will.

1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:53.888
You'll probably get arrested.

1:00:53.921 --> 1:00:55.524
Aren't you supposed to
be taking notes on this?

1:00:55.557 --> 1:00:58.792
No, Hawk, I think we have
bigger problems right now.

1:00:58.826 --> 1:00:59.827
Holy shit!

1:00:59.860 --> 1:01:01.395
Why didn't I think of that?

1:01:01.428 --> 1:01:02.531
Hold on.

1:01:02.564 --> 1:01:04.965
Rev, I'm breaking rule three.

1:01:09.503 --> 1:01:11.372
God, Hawk, what is it now?

1:01:11.405 --> 1:01:12.206
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:01:12.239 --> 1:01:13.941
I just wanted to call and
confess

1:01:13.974 --> 1:01:16.210
that we lied about those
kids with cancer earlier.

1:01:16.243 --> 1:01:17.411
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1:01:17.444 --> 1:01:20.481
They still have it, but all
the toys, they were stolen.

1:01:20.515 --> 1:01:23.817
Great, then I'll come arrest
you then.

1:01:27.021 --> 1:01:27.888
Did you just hang up on me?

1:01:27.922 --> 1:01:28.722
I did.

1:01:28.756 --> 1:01:31.425
I told you not to call this...

1:01:34.061 --> 1:01:34.862
You do that again, I swear to
God,

1:01:34.895 --> 1:01:35.829
I'll throw the book at you.

1:01:35.863 --> 1:01:36.665
You hear me?

1:01:36.697 --> 1:01:37.666
I triple dog dare you, Jack.

1:01:37.698 --> 1:01:38.533
Hawk...

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:40.734
You didn't say where, genius.

1:01:40.768 --> 1:01:42.537
Oh, son of a bitch!

1:01:44.138 --> 1:01:44.939
Just hit redial!

1:01:44.972 --> 1:01:45.973
I don't have redial.

1:01:46.006 --> 1:01:47.576
You just hit the same button.

1:01:47.609 --> 1:01:49.176
Hold on.

1:01:50.110 --> 1:01:51.845
Hawk, you are done, do you
hear me?

1:01:51.879 --> 1:01:53.582
I'm going to own your ass,
mister!

1:01:53.615 --> 1:01:56.150
I forgot to say I'll be at
the water filtration plant.

1:01:56.183 --> 1:01:58.752
I am coming for you, you son
of...

1:01:58.786 --> 1:01:59.588
He'll be there.

1:02:27.448 --> 1:02:31.519
Usually, I get so hard
in a car full of people.

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:35.422
I mean, I'm usually up to fuck,
mmm,

1:02:37.424 --> 1:02:38.325
so much.

1:02:38.359 --> 1:02:39.594
But I'm scared.

1:02:41.630 --> 1:02:42.396
I'm gonna be honest.

1:02:42.429 --> 1:02:43.864
I'm scared, guys.

1:02:44.733 --> 1:02:47.868
I mean, my dick can't
get hard when I'm scared

1:02:47.901 --> 1:02:50.938
'cause Andros Junior doesn't
like fear.

1:02:50.971 --> 1:02:52.406
He likes pussies.

1:02:55.109 --> 1:02:57.579
I wonder what he's doing over
there.

1:02:57.612 --> 1:03:00.481
He's probably talking on
the phone with his mommy.

1:03:00.515 --> 1:03:03.784
I mean, what kind of loser
ass vampire lives in a garage?

1:03:03.817 --> 1:03:05.853
Weren't you living in
your parents' backyard?

1:03:05.886 --> 1:03:07.154
Yeah, so what?

1:03:07.187 --> 1:03:09.323
So where are you living now,
Hawk?

1:03:09.356 --> 1:03:12.359
Uh, in a tent in the
camp down by the gully.

1:03:12.393 --> 1:03:13.595
What are you trying to say, Rev?

1:03:13.628 --> 1:03:15.396
I'm pretty sure he's trying to
say

1:03:15.429 --> 1:03:17.264
at least Jasper lives inside.

1:03:17.298 --> 1:03:18.399
That's what I'm trying to say.

1:03:18.432 --> 1:03:19.233
Yeah.

1:03:19.266 --> 1:03:20.535
Oh, I see how it is.

1:03:20.568 --> 1:03:21.670
You know what?

1:03:21.703 --> 1:03:23.971
I don't need help, especially
from some girl writer,

1:03:24.004 --> 1:03:25.640
and some lame old goth band,

1:03:25.674 --> 1:03:29.678
and a sad loser traitor
I thought was my friend.

1:03:39.019 --> 1:03:40.622
I really think we
should wait for the cops, Hawk.

1:03:40.655 --> 1:03:42.590
Oh, yeah, and just let
that son of a bitch cop

1:03:42.624 --> 1:03:44.992
with cool hair take all the
glory?

1:03:45.025 --> 1:03:46.528
No freaking way.

1:03:46.561 --> 1:03:48.095
And another thing, fiery fox.

1:03:48.128 --> 1:03:49.564
If I survive this battle,

1:03:49.597 --> 1:03:51.666
we're going on a proper date,
damn it,

1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:53.867
not just another
one-night stand in my tent

1:03:53.901 --> 1:03:56.070
down in that camp down by the
gully

1:03:56.103 --> 1:03:59.273
next to that sad, sad snoring
accountant.

1:03:59.306 --> 1:04:00.107
Terry.

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:00.941
I like Terry.

1:04:00.974 --> 1:04:01.776
Yeah.

1:04:01.810 --> 1:04:02.610
I mean, no.

1:04:02.644 --> 1:04:04.044
I mean, we're going on a proper
date

1:04:04.078 --> 1:04:06.447
to a place named after
a garden or something.

1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:08.650
They, they may even prepare
a salad at the table.

1:04:08.683 --> 1:04:12.687
I don't know, but we are
going, even if you did have

1:04:12.721 --> 1:04:17.458
liberal arts, creepy, poly,
gothic group sex or whatever

1:04:17.491 --> 1:04:19.761
with all or most of these
people.

1:04:19.794 --> 1:04:22.262
Yeah, that's not what's going
on here.

1:04:22.296 --> 1:04:23.097
Yeah.

1:04:23.130 --> 1:04:26.133
Believe it or not, we're
monogamous.

1:04:28.536 --> 1:04:30.204
It really bothers you, doesn't
it?

1:04:30.237 --> 1:04:31.071
No!

1:04:33.808 --> 1:04:36.143
I'm coming for you, vampire!

1:04:37.612 --> 1:04:40.447
Wait, Hawk, you forgot your
net!

1:04:42.983 --> 1:04:44.753
Is the child lock on the door?

1:04:44.786 --> 1:04:46.053
I think it's...

1:05:02.970 --> 1:05:03.904
I got it.

1:05:04.972 --> 1:05:08.142
You let them in my room
without my permission.

1:05:08.175 --> 1:05:10.645
I know it's technically the
garage.

1:05:10.678 --> 1:05:12.413
That's not the point!

1:05:13.380 --> 1:05:14.982
Jesus Christ, Rev.

1:05:15.015 --> 1:05:18.152
You can't just sneak
up on people like that.

1:05:18.185 --> 1:05:20.755
Sorry, but you forgot the...

1:05:20.789 --> 1:05:21.623
Dang it!

1:05:23.223 --> 1:05:24.057
Hawk.

1:05:25.058 --> 1:05:26.193
Are you crying?

1:05:28.328 --> 1:05:29.997
Hawk, this is huge!

1:05:30.030 --> 1:05:33.267
Hawk, you're feeling something
other than homicidal rage.

1:05:33.300 --> 1:05:34.769
Don't you make fun of me.

1:05:34.803 --> 1:05:36.170
I'm not making fun of you.

1:05:36.203 --> 1:05:36.970
You are.

1:05:37.004 --> 1:05:37.806
No, I'm not.

1:05:37.839 --> 1:05:38.640
You are.

1:05:38.673 --> 1:05:39.473
I am not.

1:05:39.507 --> 1:05:40.307
Are to!

1:05:40.340 --> 1:05:41.175
No!

1:05:42.710 --> 1:05:43.977
Are to.

1:05:44.011 --> 1:05:45.279
Am not.

1:05:45.312 --> 1:05:46.848
Should we be helping
them?

1:05:46.881 --> 1:05:48.783
Dude, we're musicians.

1:05:48.817 --> 1:05:50.518
We don't tussle with vampires.

1:05:50.552 --> 1:05:52.119
Totally.

1:05:52.152 --> 1:05:54.622
We could tussle with this.

1:05:54.656 --> 1:05:55.857
God, you make me so angry!

1:05:55.890 --> 1:05:57.458
You're not even a real
pacifist!

1:05:57.491 --> 1:05:58.292
Yes, I am!

1:05:58.325 --> 1:05:59.126
It's you!

1:05:59.159 --> 1:06:01.261
You're so violent.

1:06:01.295 --> 1:06:03.964
You make fun of my feelings!

1:06:03.997 --> 1:06:05.032
I hate you.

1:06:05.065 --> 1:06:07.602
You also let them take
my favorite vampire movie.

1:06:07.635 --> 1:06:09.671
You know how much that means to
me.

1:06:09.704 --> 1:06:12.339
Yes, I know there are better
movies,

1:06:12.372 --> 1:06:13.440
but that's also not the point.

1:06:13.474 --> 1:06:14.274
Yes, I am!

1:06:14.308 --> 1:06:15.108
It's you!

1:06:15.142 --> 1:06:17.077
You, you do this to me!

1:06:22.517 --> 1:06:24.451
Mother, I have to go.

1:06:28.890 --> 1:06:30.457
Forget something?

1:06:32.292 --> 1:06:35.195
Also, where is the vampire?

1:06:35.229 --> 1:06:36.029
I'm right here.

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:39.801
Oh, he's out.

1:06:39.834 --> 1:06:41.201
I'm warning you, fang face.

1:06:41.235 --> 1:06:42.737
I'm a 12-degree black belt.

1:06:42.770 --> 1:06:44.639
I was army deep deep special
ops.

1:06:44.672 --> 1:06:46.741
And I've battled your loser kind
before.

1:06:46.774 --> 1:06:48.108
Yeah, and I...

1:06:49.611 --> 1:06:51.946
I got this silver-plated net.

1:06:51.980 --> 1:06:53.815
Now, you lay down
those fangs and surrender

1:06:53.848 --> 1:06:56.316
or we're gonna be forced to get
physical.

1:06:56.350 --> 1:06:57.552
Oh, I got that one.

1:06:57.585 --> 1:06:58.586
I love that song,

1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:00.788
- get physical.
- Oh, come on, Rev.

1:07:00.822 --> 1:07:03.591
I am so gonna enjoy this.

1:07:03.625 --> 1:07:05.325
Hey, guys.

1:07:05.359 --> 1:07:07.729
Who's your friend with the cool
fangs?

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.062
Run, Terry!

1:07:09.096 --> 1:07:09.998
What?

1:07:10.030 --> 1:07:10.798
- He's a vampire!
- He's a vampire, Terry!

1:07:10.832 --> 1:07:11.633
Run!

1:07:11.666 --> 1:07:12.634
Vampire?

1:07:12.667 --> 1:07:14.234
He's a
fucking, vampire, Terry!

1:07:14.268 --> 1:07:15.068
Run!

1:07:15.102 --> 1:07:15.937
Wait.

1:07:16.804 --> 1:07:18.138
That's not cool.

1:07:24.211 --> 1:07:25.880
Terry!

1:07:25.914 --> 1:07:27.281
Not cool!

1:07:27.314 --> 1:07:30.183
You get off him, you cannibal!

1:07:30.217 --> 1:07:31.886
What are you gonna do, cry
about it?

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:33.955
Like you did every night
in cell block nine?

1:07:33.988 --> 1:07:36.858
You'd cry too if your
cellmate was a sexual predator.

1:07:36.891 --> 1:07:37.692
Yeah!

1:07:37.725 --> 1:07:38.526
- Wait, what?
- What, you're...

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:39.827
No one's asking either of you.

1:07:39.861 --> 1:07:40.995
Come on, Hawk.

1:07:41.029 --> 1:07:43.998
There's no need to get
all up in arms about it.

1:07:49.236 --> 1:07:50.505
Catch!

1:07:50.538 --> 1:07:51.639
Oh, God!

1:07:52.707 --> 1:07:53.541
Oh!

1:07:58.613 --> 1:07:59.614
Did he just rip that man's...

1:07:59.647 --> 1:08:01.415
Arm off and throw it at 'em?

1:08:01.448 --> 1:08:02.416
Not cool!

1:08:02.449 --> 1:08:03.518
My arm!

1:08:03.551 --> 1:08:05.385
You back away from
that homeless accountant,

1:08:05.419 --> 1:08:06.821
you vicious vampire scum!

1:08:06.854 --> 1:08:09.356
What's wrong with you,
you bloodsucking bastard!

1:08:09.389 --> 1:08:10.959
Pick on someone your own size!

1:08:10.992 --> 1:08:12.259
I'm sorry, guys.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:14.494
Were you trying to get a leg up
on me?

1:08:14.529 --> 1:08:15.630
Not my leg!

1:08:15.663 --> 1:08:17.065
Not his leg!

1:08:17.097 --> 1:08:18.231
Not the leg!

1:08:29.409 --> 1:08:30.745
So much blood.

1:08:45.292 --> 1:08:46.928
He's laughing at us, Rev!

1:08:46.961 --> 1:08:47.862
Come on, man!

1:08:47.895 --> 1:08:49.262
He won't stop throwing limbs
at me.

1:08:49.296 --> 1:08:51.599
Guys, guys, guys.

1:08:51.633 --> 1:08:53.133
No need to lose your head over
it.

1:08:53.166 --> 1:08:53.968
Don't you even.

1:08:54.002 --> 1:08:54.802
No!

1:08:54.836 --> 1:08:55.803
Not the head!

1:08:55.837 --> 1:08:56.638
- Please don't do that!
- No, don't.

1:08:56.671 --> 1:08:57.471
Not that, no!

1:08:57.505 --> 1:09:00.273
Any last words, accountant?

1:09:00.307 --> 1:09:02.043
Tell my mom

1:09:02.076 --> 1:09:05.145
that she can't write the
ferrets off on federal tax.

1:09:05.178 --> 1:09:07.882
But maybe try state because they
can count

1:09:07.915 --> 1:09:12.053
as companion animals, you
know, for emotional support.

1:09:12.086 --> 1:09:13.588
Emotional support!

1:09:15.990 --> 1:09:16.991
No!

1:09:17.025 --> 1:09:18.026
No!

1:09:20.193 --> 1:09:20.995
No!

1:09:26.134 --> 1:09:27.200
No!

1:09:42.850 --> 1:09:45.285
You're going down, Hawk.

1:09:45.318 --> 1:09:47.454
This is the last time you do
this to me.

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:48.823
Now you're mine.

1:09:50.290 --> 1:09:51.191
You know,

1:09:52.392 --> 1:09:55.129
I used to be just like you guys.

1:09:55.163 --> 1:09:56.363
I fought evil.

1:09:56.396 --> 1:09:58.633
I defended the good and the
weak.

1:09:58.666 --> 1:10:00.935
Hell, I even had 72 red baron
kills.

1:10:00.968 --> 1:10:03.104
You're nothing like us,
vampire.

1:10:03.137 --> 1:10:04.772
That is a shit ton of kills.

1:10:04.806 --> 1:10:05.673
That is a lot of kills.

1:10:05.707 --> 1:10:07.240
Yeah, you're like a mass
murderer.

1:10:07.274 --> 1:10:08.810
They're blood suckers, Rev.

1:10:08.843 --> 1:10:11.879
Yeah, anyway, you know what I
got

1:10:11.913 --> 1:10:15.183
after defending Santa
Muerte for all those years,

1:10:15.215 --> 1:10:18.086
after all that blood, sweat and
sacrifice?

1:10:18.119 --> 1:10:19.587
I don't know, vampire.

1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:22.924
A raging boner load of
your own satisfaction?

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:24.224
That's what I'd have.

1:10:24.257 --> 1:10:25.526
I got nothing.

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.260
It was meaningless.

1:10:27.294 --> 1:10:29.731
I was resigned to my mortal
fate,

1:10:29.764 --> 1:10:31.833
until I got a call from a
nursing home

1:10:31.866 --> 1:10:34.702
about some old drooling
Nosferatu.

1:10:40.273 --> 1:10:41.576
Give up, you old demon!

1:10:41.609 --> 1:10:42.710
Never!

1:10:42.744 --> 1:10:44.679
Join me, human spawn.

1:10:57.290 --> 1:11:00.393
And just like that, I was
immortal,

1:11:01.361 --> 1:11:03.998
at the top of the food chain
officially.

1:11:04.031 --> 1:11:06.934
And there's plenty of
room up here for you,

1:11:06.968 --> 1:11:08.536
your boyfriend,

1:11:08.569 --> 1:11:12.339
and his mentally challenged
janitor sidekick.

1:11:13.273 --> 1:11:15.442
You should all just join me.

1:11:15.475 --> 1:11:16.878
We could rule the world.

1:11:16.911 --> 1:11:18.780
We'll never join you, vampire.

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:21.649
Also, Rev is not mentally
challenged.

1:11:21.682 --> 1:11:24.417
He is a goddamn groundskeeping
engineer.

1:11:24.451 --> 1:11:26.120
Thank you for remembering
that, Hawk.

1:11:26.154 --> 1:11:29.090
Also, Hawk is not my
boyfriend.

1:11:29.123 --> 1:11:30.191
Wait, what?

1:11:30.224 --> 1:11:32.359
You're not my boyfriend, Hawk!

1:11:32.392 --> 1:11:34.195
But we had all that sex.

1:11:34.228 --> 1:11:35.930
I mean, you even let me do that
thing.

1:11:35.963 --> 1:11:39.466
Yeah, she let me do that thing
too, man.

1:11:41.135 --> 1:11:44.005
You slept with a vampire?

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:46.473
Dude, this is so boring.

1:11:46.507 --> 1:11:49.376
I mean, other than that poor
man's limbs being ripped off.

1:11:49.409 --> 1:11:51.344
Yeah, there was that.

1:11:51.378 --> 1:11:52.980
I thought Hawk said he was a
black belt.

1:11:53.014 --> 1:11:53.815
Come on.

1:11:53.848 --> 1:11:56.150
He thought we were vampires.

1:11:58.252 --> 1:11:59.754
Where the fuck did you get
popcorn?

1:11:59.787 --> 1:12:00.955
Yeah.

1:12:00.988 --> 1:12:02.089
When did you pop that?

1:12:02.123 --> 1:12:03.124
How do you even get it in your
mouth?

1:12:03.157 --> 1:12:05.358
I didn't open your zipper.

1:12:05.392 --> 1:12:06.828
Oh, you're doing that yourself
now?

1:12:13.835 --> 1:12:16.671
You're motherfucking mine.

1:12:17.538 --> 1:12:18.338
Come on, Hawk.

1:12:18.371 --> 1:12:19.507
I mean, you just gotta get past

1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:23.778
your narrow-minded views of
monogamous relationships.

1:12:23.811 --> 1:12:24.612
Yeah.

1:12:24.645 --> 1:12:27.347
Seriously, dude, relax.

1:12:27.380 --> 1:12:28.716
Hawk, join me.

1:12:29.684 --> 1:12:31.853
You can have any man or woman
you want,

1:12:31.886 --> 1:12:34.589
be or do anything you want.

1:12:34.622 --> 1:12:35.823
And you never have to work

1:12:35.857 --> 1:12:39.426
as a small town night
security guard again.

1:12:40.828 --> 1:12:43.898
People might even take you
seriously.

1:12:47.134 --> 1:12:48.302
I'm not gonna lie, guys.

1:12:48.336 --> 1:12:50.304
This is sounding pretty good.

1:12:50.338 --> 1:12:52.573
I mean, no one ever takes me
seriously.

1:12:52.607 --> 1:12:55.142
- Yeah, they don't.
- They really don't.

1:12:55.176 --> 1:12:56.110
At all.

1:12:56.143 --> 1:12:58.279
I didn't think it was that
bad.

1:12:58.312 --> 1:13:01.349
Look, I appreciate the offer,
vampire.

1:13:01.381 --> 1:13:02.984
I really do.

1:13:03.017 --> 1:13:06.287
But I'm already pretty
good at kicking asses.

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:10.658
And Theo here, I mean,
she's all the woman I need.

1:13:10.691 --> 1:13:13.594
Also, I kinda like being a
small town night security guard

1:13:13.628 --> 1:13:16.097
who's bad with women and
people don't take seriously.

1:13:16.130 --> 1:13:18.232
It gives me the element of
surprise.

1:13:18.266 --> 1:13:21.302
Also, I'm not a cannibal,
and I don't eat people.

1:13:21.335 --> 1:13:22.169
That's the same thing.

1:13:22.203 --> 1:13:23.137
You just said the same thing
twice.

1:13:23.170 --> 1:13:23.971
That's the same.

1:13:24.005 --> 1:13:25.373
Yeah, that's the same thing,
man.

1:13:25.405 --> 1:13:26.207
You know what?

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.508
What-fucking-ever, vampire!

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:29.543
I'm done playing your
bloodsucking games!

1:13:29.577 --> 1:13:30.378
Yeah.

1:13:30.410 --> 1:13:31.345
Yeah.

1:13:31.379 --> 1:13:32.313
Now, I'm gonna give you one
last chance

1:13:32.346 --> 1:13:34.481
to lay down those fangs and
surrender.

1:13:34.515 --> 1:13:37.484
Or mark my words as
Hawk-Hawk, vampire slayer,

1:13:37.518 --> 1:13:39.987
savior and protector of Santa
Muerte...

1:13:40.021 --> 1:13:40.988
Yeah.

1:13:41.022 --> 1:13:42.489
I will drive a stake
right through that ass!

1:13:42.523 --> 1:13:43.324
Yeah!

1:13:43.357 --> 1:13:44.158
Or chest.

1:13:44.191 --> 1:13:44.992
What?

1:13:45.026 --> 1:13:46.627
You get the idea!

1:13:49.230 --> 1:13:51.999
Damn it, I forgot my secret
stake.

1:13:52.033 --> 1:13:54.368
If you trace your steps
back, maybe we can figure out.

1:13:54.402 --> 1:13:56.003
You had it at the religious
supply store

1:13:56.037 --> 1:13:57.271
- so maybe you left it...
- Rev, we get it!

1:13:57.305 --> 1:13:58.438
I got this, okay?

1:14:24.665 --> 1:14:25.566
Oh, yeah!

1:14:28.302 --> 1:14:30.371
Holy shit, that's working!

1:14:30.404 --> 1:14:33.341
Oh, vampires don't like Jesus.

1:14:33.374 --> 1:14:35.475
Quick, Rev, get the
silver-plated net.

1:14:35.509 --> 1:14:37.278
We're taking this one alive.

1:14:37.311 --> 1:14:38.679
Right behind you.

1:14:38.713 --> 1:14:39.547
Catch!

1:14:41.449 --> 1:14:44.652
In the name of the father, the
son

1:14:44.685 --> 1:14:47.188
and the motherfucking holy
ghost!

1:14:47.221 --> 1:14:48.222
And Jesus!

1:14:49.423 --> 1:14:50.490
One.

1:14:50.524 --> 1:14:51.592
Two.

1:14:51.625 --> 1:14:52.460
Three!

1:14:55.563 --> 1:14:56.397
Yeah!

1:15:05.539 --> 1:15:07.675
Don't you hiss at my woman, fang
face.

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:09.076
Easy, Hawk.

1:15:09.110 --> 1:15:11.045
Yeah, I can take care
of myself, thank you.

1:15:11.078 --> 1:15:12.213
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1:15:12.246 --> 1:15:13.280
I forgot.

1:15:13.314 --> 1:15:16.784
Hawk, you know, I'm
just so proud of you.

1:15:16.817 --> 1:15:17.752
I really am.

1:15:17.785 --> 1:15:19.220
I think you've done a wonderful
job.

1:15:19.253 --> 1:15:20.621
Oh, thanks, Rev.

1:15:20.654 --> 1:15:21.555
You know what?

1:15:21.589 --> 1:15:23.824
I think you can wear one of my
vests now.

1:15:23.858 --> 1:15:24.658
You earned it.

1:15:24.692 --> 1:15:25.659
Really?

1:15:25.693 --> 1:15:28.662
I've always wanted to
wear one of your vests.

1:15:28.696 --> 1:15:30.231
Theo, what do you think?

1:15:30.264 --> 1:15:31.832
Okay, Hawk, I'll write about
you.

1:15:31.866 --> 1:15:34.335
And I will consider being your
girlfriend.

1:15:34.368 --> 1:15:36.437
No, no, I mean about
wearing one of my vests.

1:15:36.470 --> 1:15:37.271
Oh, my God.

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:38.105
I'll think about it.

1:15:38.139 --> 1:15:39.040
Oh no.

1:15:39.073 --> 1:15:39.874
What?

1:15:39.907 --> 1:15:41.709
Oh, a nick,

1:15:41.742 --> 1:15:44.345
or a bite, a bite from a...

1:15:45.946 --> 1:15:47.381
The vampire nicked me!

1:15:47.415 --> 1:15:48.249
I'm gonna be a blood sucking,

1:15:48.282 --> 1:15:49.984
no, I'm gonna be a bloodsucking
vampire!

1:15:50.017 --> 1:15:50.851
Stop that!

1:15:51.752 --> 1:15:52.720
Just get away!

1:15:55.122 --> 1:15:56.190
Get that away from me!

1:15:56.223 --> 1:15:57.024
Get the hell back!

1:15:57.058 --> 1:15:59.528
I'm a bloodsucking vampire!

1:15:59.593 --> 1:16:00.394
Oh no!

1:16:02.163 --> 1:16:02.997
Oh God!

1:16:04.298 --> 1:16:05.833
Jesus Christ.

1:16:05.866 --> 1:16:07.501
Oh God.

1:16:07.536 --> 1:16:09.203
Hey, Jack.

1:16:09.236 --> 1:16:11.506
We finally caught ourselves a
vampire.

1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:12.573
This is Deputy Jack Scroggins.

1:16:12.606 --> 1:16:13.674
I'm gonna need some help up here

1:16:13.707 --> 1:16:15.476
on the road to Santa Muerte
water filtration plant.

1:16:15.510 --> 1:16:17.144
Somebody get my stepmom!

1:16:17.178 --> 1:16:18.012
Oh my God!

1:16:19.013 --> 1:16:21.315
Also, he may turn into one,
so.

1:16:21.348 --> 1:16:22.249
I'm a future killer.

1:16:22.283 --> 1:16:23.184
I'm a future killer.

1:16:23.217 --> 1:16:24.251
I'm gonna kill people in the
future.

1:16:24.285 --> 1:16:25.719
Make that a lot of help.

1:16:25.753 --> 1:16:26.555
You did it!

1:16:26.587 --> 1:16:27.488
You did it!

1:16:31.158 --> 1:16:31.959
Oh God!

1:16:31.992 --> 1:16:34.261
Can we get a bandaid?

1:16:34.295 --> 1:16:36.263
Horrible timing.

1:16:36.297 --> 1:16:37.131

you're feeling well
enough to go back to work.

1:17:18.639 --> 1:17:20.575
Maybe you'll finally move out of
the yard,

1:17:20.609 --> 1:17:22.710
or better yet, back into the
house.

1:17:50.938 --> 1:17:52.339
I'm proud of you.

1:17:54.041 --> 1:17:55.577
You just take it easy there,
vampire.

1:17:55.610 --> 1:17:56.810
I got my eye on you.

1:17:56.844 --> 1:17:58.779
I'm not a vampire, silly.

1:17:58.812 --> 1:18:00.582
How could I exist in the sun?

1:18:00.615 --> 1:18:01.583
I don't know.

1:18:01.616 --> 1:18:03.552
Maybe your clean vegan
lifestyle has turned you

1:18:03.585 --> 1:18:06.987
into a vegan super vampire
who's impervious to the sun.

1:18:07.021 --> 1:18:09.957
Well, I'm not craving
human blood or anything

1:18:09.990 --> 1:18:11.593
or any type of blood.

1:18:11.626 --> 1:18:13.360
And I'm not thinking about
murder.

1:18:13.394 --> 1:18:14.261
Well, that's good.

1:18:14.295 --> 1:18:15.729
But if you try anything...

1:18:15.763 --> 1:18:16.565
I won't.

1:18:16.598 --> 1:18:18.432
Yeah, but if you do.

1:18:21.468 --> 1:18:22.436
Dang it, Hawk.

1:18:22.469 --> 1:18:25.072
I thought we agreed, no
secret stake at tai chi.

1:18:25.105 --> 1:18:25.906
We did.

1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:26.707
But you still brought it.

1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:27.542
I know.

1:18:27.576 --> 1:18:28.943
It's a gift.

1:18:28.976 --> 1:18:30.144
It's for you.

1:18:30.177 --> 1:18:31.011
For me?

1:18:32.346 --> 1:18:34.415
Hawk, you son of a bitch.

1:18:40.154 --> 1:18:42.389
What's the matter, old boy?

1:18:44.124 --> 1:18:45.292
You vampire!

1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:47.696
You!

1:18:50.699 --> 1:18:51.700
Damn it.

1:18:51.732 --> 1:18:53.934
My own secret stake.

1:18:53.968 --> 1:18:55.836
Yeah, so this way,
you know, if you turn,

1:18:55.869 --> 1:18:56.904
you can just stake yourself

1:18:56.937 --> 1:19:01.008
so I don't have to live
with the guilt of it all.

1:19:12.554 --> 1:19:13.887
You're welcome.

1:19:13.921 --> 1:19:14.723
I'm sorry.

1:19:14.755 --> 1:19:15.557
For what?

1:19:15.590 --> 1:19:16.658
For saving Santa Muerte

1:19:16.691 --> 1:19:18.926
from bloodsucking vampires.

1:19:20.662 --> 1:19:22.429
I'm just glad everything's
settled down.

1:19:22.463 --> 1:19:24.765
Well, either way, I'll still
be here

1:19:24.798 --> 1:19:26.601
carting this empty building.

1:19:26.635 --> 1:19:27.569
And you'll be on time.

1:19:27.602 --> 1:19:28.603
Jesus Christ, Arnold.

1:19:28.637 --> 1:19:29.738
Give me a damn break.

1:19:29.770 --> 1:19:30.838
I'll give you a break, Hawk,

1:19:30.871 --> 1:19:32.607
when you stop attacking my
religion.

1:19:32.641 --> 1:19:35.276
Well, we'll call it a Mexican
standoff.

1:19:35.309 --> 1:19:36.678
Speaking of breaks, I
think it's about time

1:19:36.711 --> 1:19:37.746
for me to take mine.

1:19:37.778 --> 1:19:38.713
You just clocked in.

1:19:38.747 --> 1:19:40.314
Take it up with the damn
liberals.

1:20:00.501 --> 1:20:02.836
Hey, what's up, guys?

1:20:02.870 --> 1:20:03.705
I'm back.

1:20:05.039 --> 1:20:06.440
How was your gig?

Take off the mask, Forneus.

You're wearing Forneus's gimp
mask.

1:21:14.341 --> 1:21:15.710
I'm sorry, guys.

1:21:15.744 --> 1:21:20.548
It's just that I get really
lonely down at hobo camp.

1:21:20.582 --> 1:21:24.686
Just everyone always leaves me,
like Theo.

1:21:24.719 --> 1:21:27.187
I'm just trying to fit in.

1:21:27.221 --> 1:21:28.590
What?

1:21:28.623 --> 1:21:30.592
You know what, if you guys
aren't gonna accept me,

1:21:30.625 --> 1:21:33.026
then I'll just, I'll just go!

1:21:33.961 --> 1:21:34.763
Wow.

1:21:35.996 --> 1:21:37.231
Can you leave the popcorn at
least?

1:21:37.264 --> 1:21:38.265
Fine!

1:21:38.298 --> 1:21:40.200
I have the munchies, drama
queen.

1:21:40.234 --> 1:21:42.269
Seriously though.

1:21:42.302 --> 1:21:44.071
What's his problem?

1:21:44.104 --> 1:21:45.072
Drama.

1:21:45.105 --> 1:21:46.206
Yeah.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:47.307
Wait.

1:21:47.341 --> 1:21:50.779
Where is
Forneus?

1:21:50.812 --> 1:21:52.079
Rev, what
the hell are you doing?

1:21:52.112 --> 1:21:54.014
Why are you wearing
Forneus's gimp mask, Rev?

1:21:54.047 --> 1:21:55.449
Geeze louise, guys.

1:21:55.482 --> 1:21:56.785
You have to get over
your narrow-minded view

1:21:56.818 --> 1:21:58.720
of slave/domination.

1:21:58.753 --> 1:22:00.921
I mean, it is 2030, right?

1:22:02.122 --> 1:22:03.323
It is?

1:22:03.357 --> 1:22:07.961
Yeah, it takes a really long
time to make an indie film.

1:22:07.995 --> 1:22:09.430
Yeah, I guess he's right.

1:22:09.463 --> 1:22:11.198
Oh, wait, popcorn!

1:22:11.231 --> 1:22:12.032
Okay.

1:22:12.065 --> 1:22:13.802
It's soy milk flavored.

1:22:13.835 --> 1:22:15.302
Hmm.

1:22:15.335 --> 1:22:16.270
I like soy milk.

1:22:16.303 --> 1:22:18.740
Oh, God, that's disgusting!

1:22:22.610 --> 1:22:23.611
Hey, guys.

1:22:23.645 --> 1:22:24.779
Terry, what the hell are you
doing?

1:22:24.813 --> 1:22:27.047
Why are you wearing
Forneus's gimp mask, Terry?

1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:28.248
Oh, that.

1:22:28.282 --> 1:22:30.250
I'm just trying to get away from
my mom.

1:22:30.284 --> 1:22:31.452
She keeps trying to make me do

1:22:31.485 --> 1:22:33.555
weird deductions with her taxes,

1:22:33.588 --> 1:22:36.558
you know, ferrets, and
barrels of toxic waste,

1:22:36.591 --> 1:22:39.727
and a life-sized blow-up
doll of my stepdad.

1:22:39.761 --> 1:22:40.895
Gross.

1:22:40.929 --> 1:22:42.597
But we just saw
you get ripped to shreds.

1:22:42.630 --> 1:22:44.699
By a blood-thirsty vampire.

1:22:44.732 --> 1:22:45.767
I know.

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:49.671
It's weird how life works
out sometimes, right?

1:22:52.406 --> 1:22:53.675
Who the hell are you?

1:22:53.708 --> 1:22:57.010
Yeah, and why are you
wearing Forneus's gimp mask?

1:22:57.044 --> 1:22:57.846
I'm Sean.

1:22:57.879 --> 1:22:59.012
I'm the cinematographer.

1:22:59.046 --> 1:23:00.548
You know, with these low-budget
movies,

1:23:00.582 --> 1:23:02.650
you know, not enough
budget for other actors.

1:23:02.684 --> 1:23:04.151
Okay, sure.

1:23:04.184 --> 1:23:05.085
But then who's...

1:23:05.118 --> 1:23:08.188
Yeah, who's filming us right
now?

1:23:08.222 --> 1:23:11.492
That's a good question,
actually.

1:23:11.526 --> 1:23:13.360
Hasta la vista, baby.

1:23:13.393 --> 1:23:14.529
It's Terminator.

1:23:14.562 --> 1:23:15.530
Right.

1:23:15.563 --> 1:23:16.965
This is the one where
he goes back to the past

1:23:16.997 --> 1:23:18.232
to kill, right?

1:23:19.299 --> 1:23:20.702
I never saw it.

1:23:21.703 --> 1:23:24.238
Hey, this is a
really nice shot, vampire.

1:23:24.271 --> 1:23:27.040
Yeah, looking good, vampire
brother.

1:23:27.074 --> 1:23:28.308
Whoa, whoa.

1:23:28.342 --> 1:23:30.077
Rev, you can't say that.

1:23:30.110 --> 1:23:31.144
He's the director.

1:23:31.178 --> 1:23:32.614
Plus that's not cool.

1:23:32.647 --> 1:23:34.147
Yeah, but I'm also half
vampire now,

1:23:34.181 --> 1:23:37.351
so I can say things like that,
right?

1:23:37.384 --> 1:23:41.856
I'll always think of you as
a half human hippie janitor.

1:23:41.890 --> 1:23:43.457
Well, first off, I'm not a
janitor.

1:23:43.490 --> 1:23:45.259
I'm a groundskeeping engineer.

1:23:45.292 --> 1:23:48.195
And apparently, I'm an actor,
so.

1:23:48.228 --> 1:23:49.029
I looked at your eye again.

1:23:49.062 --> 1:23:49.864
I'm sorry.

1:23:49.898 --> 1:23:50.698
I can't help it.
