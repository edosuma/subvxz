In the criminal justice system,

00:08.476 --> 00:12.213
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.648
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.648 --> 00:16.484
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.484 --> 00:17.918
are members of an elite squad

00:17.918 --> 00:20.221
known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.221 --> 00:23.091
These are their stories.

We're going to see Dr. Lee
today.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.508
Guess who's gonna
get a lollipop.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.410
You remember Dr. Lee,
don't you?

00:42.410 --> 00:43.611
Oh, yes.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.246
I want a lollipop.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.447
* You're Daddy's little girl

00:46.447 --> 00:48.349
* Just take a bite

00:48.349 --> 00:50.384
99. How do you feel?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.286
I'm fine.

Dad says I should
go to school.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.090
Okay, but take it easy.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.291
* Lose control

00:57.291 --> 00:58.459
Bye, Aiden.

00:58.459 --> 01:02.463
* She was so shy

01:02.463 --> 01:06.134

with the boys in the place *

02:38.992 --> 02:41.028
* Treat 'em like
they don't stand a chance *

02:41.028 --> 02:43.130
* And he got a way
with the girls in the back *

02:43.130 --> 02:44.998
* Acting like they too hot
to dance *

02:44.998 --> 02:47.000

.

04:01.842 --> 04:02.643
So a group of kids
from Tribeca Academy

04:04.578 --> 04:07.080
went off campus today for lunch
and had a rainbow party.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.148
A rainbow party?

04:08.148 --> 04:09.483
They're still having those?

04:09.483 --> 04:10.851
I thought
they were a suburban myth.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.085
Yeah, well, apparently not.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.754
Explicit photos were taken,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.823
and then they went viral
at the school,

04:15.823 --> 04:17.991
so we've got a lot of kids,
panicking parents.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.327
Did I miss an episode
of Girls?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.328
Remind me
what a rainbow party is.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.795
Remind you?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.097
It's when, um, when girls wear
different shades of lipstick

04:24.097 --> 04:26.233
and they take turns
on the guys.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.336
Yeah, the first guy to get every
color of the rainbow, he wins.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.970
Come on. We'll brief
each other in the car, guys.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.639
Let's go.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.674
I'm never having kids.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.411
(Schwartz)
Thank you for coming so quickly.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.447
I don't think that what
they did was a crime.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.349
Okay, you did the right thing
by calling us.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.216
Now, were you able
to ID the kids from the party?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.418
Yes, I was.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.853
There were nine of them.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.688
All ninth and tenth graders.

04:47.688 --> 04:51.459
Their parents pay 45,000 a year
in tuition.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.226
They're not taking this well.

04:53.226 --> 04:57.197
[overlapping chatter]

04:57.197 --> 05:01.635
Everyone quiet, please.
Quiet!

05:01.635 --> 05:03.837
The police are here to take
your children's statements.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.238
Police?
These are kids.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.374
- This is ridiculous.
- Savannah didn't do anything.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.908
I realize
that we're all upset.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.177
There will be time
to discuss policy going forward.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.980
For now, we need to deal
with the situation at hand.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.982
This is Sergeant Benson
from SVU.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.450
- SVU? Are you kidding me?
- What's going on?

05:16.450 --> 05:17.885
That's unbelievable.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.453
We realize that kids are kids,

05:19.453 --> 05:21.389
and we want
to keep this in proportion.

05:21.389 --> 05:25.192
We just also need to determine
if any crimes were committed.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.727
- Crimes?
- This is a mistake.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.896
Why'd they even call the police?

05:28.896 --> 05:31.298
You can be present
when we talk to your child.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.467
As for cell phones
and social media,

05:33.467 --> 05:36.404
any pictures from the party
should not be posted or shared.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.540
We appreciate
your cooperation.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.174
Thank you.
Shall we begin?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.811
Good luck.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.079
And where did you hear
about the party?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.248
Jaden texted me.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.917
Savannah's parents
weren't home.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.685
We were just gonna
get some tacos.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.921
It wasn't
my daughter's idea.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.490
You were bullied,
right, honey?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.559
Look, the lipstick
was the girls' idea.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.127
Uh-huh, and what they did
after they put it on,

06:00.127 --> 06:01.662
whose idea was that?

06:01.662 --> 06:05.065
My son told me the girls were
just as complicit as the boys.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.900
I don't feel
so good, Mom.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.102
I just need to know if anybody
asked you to do something

06:09.102 --> 06:11.204
that you didn't want to do.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.174
There was this pressure
to do all the guys.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.544
Some of the girls did
but not me.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.078
I don't even like Jaden.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.747
Okay, okay.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.349
The guys you were with,
did they pressure you?

06:22.349 --> 06:23.984
It's okay to tell them,
Savannah.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.086
Mom, it was mostly
just Leo.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.489
You know him.
He's my lab partner.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.857
I don't know
where the lipstick came from.

06:29.857 --> 06:30.924
We were just playing a game.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.727
What kind of game, Leo?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.363
It's this game where you
suck a card against your lips,

06:36.363 --> 06:37.465
and then you try--

06:37.465 --> 06:39.099
Blow it on someone else?

06:39.099 --> 06:42.603
Yeah, but, I mean,
sometimes the card falls.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.237
[coughs]

06:44.237 --> 06:45.739
Then you just kiss
when that happens.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.107
Okay, so kissing games.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.109
Whose idea was it
to go further?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.744
Excuse me.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.380
We've met, haven't we?
I'm Colleen Dole.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.584
We saw each other this morning
at the pediatrician's office.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.487
- So Gabriel's your older son?
- Stepson.

06:59.487 --> 07:03.023
He lives with me and his father,
who's in Moscow on business.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.825
Does Dad have to know
about this?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.293
That you were drinking
and smoking

07:06.293 --> 07:07.995
and doing God
knows what else?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.663
He already does.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.164
Fine, there was
weed there, Dad.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.000
But I didn't smoke it.
I run track.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.602
So we done here?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.169
Not yet.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.572
Your son sent sexually explicit
photos of himself

07:18.572 --> 07:21.008
and some of the girls
to other students.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.110
Okay, who were you
playing "lipstick party" with?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.945
I'm sorry,
isn't that Leo's business?

07:24.945 --> 07:25.946
Not anymore.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.214
Now if you want,

07:27.214 --> 07:31.885
we can take your son in
and have CSU do a body exam.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.386
This is unfair.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.322
These parties have been
going on all year.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.224
This is my first one,
and I get grounded?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.859
Gabriel, are you
all right?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.293
Your father
called me from Moscow.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.895
- I'm fine.
- I've got this, Trudy.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.131
You don't look fine,
and you're warm.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.966
Colleen, has he been
eating dairy again?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.635
Excuse me.
I'm Sergeant Benson.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
Trudy Malko.
I'm Gabriel's mother.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.840
- We share custody.
- Okay.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.742
I heard Savannah hosted this.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.811
Just so you know, Mia's a very
engaged parent, very present.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.713
I'm sure she didn't know
about this.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.214
Okay, thank you.
That's helpful.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.550
[coughs]

08:06.920 --> 08:07.921
[knocks at door]

08:07.921 --> 08:09.557
Sarge, when you have a minute,

08:09.557 --> 08:10.558
Mr. Boylan and--

08:10.558 --> 08:11.592
Ah, Mrs. Dole.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.960
Come on in.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.261
How can we help you?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.764
Thank you.
We just wanted to apologize.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.032
We know you took a lot of grief
at the school today.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.034
Everyone was defensive,
fronting.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.003
- Freaking out, really.
- Yeah.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.271
I mean,
most of these kids

08:24.271 --> 08:26.273
have never been in trouble
before--not like this.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.575
Please, we understand.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.743
Listen, every parent's
first instinct

08:29.743 --> 08:31.111
is to protect their child.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.112
That's why
we're here.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.614
We wanted
to let you know that

08:33.614 --> 08:35.415
we're very upset about
this party the kids threw.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.284
And not just
the messing around,

08:37.284 --> 08:38.719
but the drinking,
the pot--

08:38.719 --> 08:40.153
Messing around?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.922
This wasn't just
a game of Spin the Bottle.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.591
We know.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.226
I had Gabriel show me
the photos.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.796
He is in very big trouble
at home.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.063
His father's
flying back tonight.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.364
And we appreciate that,

08:51.364 --> 08:54.267
but we still need to conduct
our investigation.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.036
About that,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.971
there are some rumors
going around.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.272
The girls parents
are saying

08:59.272 --> 09:00.841
the boys might
be arrested.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.043
Even though their girls
were just as complicit.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.945
What Michael means is

09:04.945 --> 09:06.947
these are good kids.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.116
No one was forced
to do anything.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.818
(Colleen)
They would never hurt each
other. They're all friends.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.285
That we understand,
Mrs. Dole,

09:12.285 --> 09:14.321
but there are
age of consent issues

09:14.321 --> 09:15.723
and video issues
to deal with.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.058
The selfies?
That's what kids do now.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.526
They record everything.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.128
But when they post or email
those images,

09:21.128 --> 09:22.663
it crosses a line.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.331
So you are
charging them?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.733
- Oh, my God.
- I told you we should've

09:25.733 --> 09:27.901
- called a lawyer.
- Listen. No. Listen.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.971
I'm glad that you came in and
there's no need to panic now.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.841
We have two of our detectives
at the D.A.'s office right now

09:33.841 --> 09:35.042
trying to sort this out.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.176
The D.A.?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.978
Please keep
some perspective.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.213
Our boys are 15
and 16.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.049
They won't do this again.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.687
Nine teenagers alone

09:46.687 --> 09:48.856
in a $10 million loft
in Tribeca.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.658
What could possibly
go wrong?

09:50.658 --> 09:51.992
Well, they got drunk and high.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.361
Stripped down and had
an oral sex competition.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.729
They used different
shades of lipstick.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.497
I-I get it.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.400
No teachers?
They're all minors?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.703
Ranging in age from
14 to 16.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.037
No one's claiming
coercion.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.673
Since no minor
engaged in sexual activity

10:05.673 --> 10:08.842
with anybody over 18,
I don't see statutory.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.277
You don't?
Not your call.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.578
But you're right.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.946
The bigger issue is
these photos.

10:12.946 --> 10:13.947
How explicit
do they get?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.749
Well, help yourself.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.084
Here.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.421
Okay...

10:21.421 --> 10:24.892
Huh...you realize that
just showing me these

10:24.892 --> 10:27.027
could be considered
a federal crime?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.195
Seriously?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.462
Yeah, if that's
your personal tablet,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.764
I'd get rid of those.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.099
How viral
has this gone?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.400
In the school,
pretty far.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.768
Email? Text?
Social media?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.036
We're not sure.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.771
Parents circled
their wagons.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.972
They brought up
right to privacy issues.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.273
I'm sure they did,
but we gotta

10:40.273 --> 10:41.574
track these images down
and remove them

10:41.574 --> 10:42.976
from the internet.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.878
Awesome idea!
How do we do that?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.446
Contact trace it.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.748
You said these photos
have been shared

10:47.748 --> 10:50.350
with every student
in the school?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.285
Confiscate every
kid's phone.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.854
- Go from there.
- Every phone?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.789
Okay, why not call NSA,
get them to

10:55.789 --> 10:57.490
tap their parents
while we're at it?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.992
Easy, Citizen Four,
we're not wiretapping.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.728
But we have got to
protect these kids.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.764
With facial recognition,
geo-tagging, photo tagging,

11:03.764 --> 11:05.465
there could be
pornographers and predators

11:05.465 --> 11:07.100
honing in on them now.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.369
You want to explain that
to the parents?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.072
That's your job.
Have fun.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.010
Your last name?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.512
[overlapping chatter]

11:21.048 --> 11:22.950
I've gotten phone calls
from parents threatening

11:22.950 --> 11:25.052
to sue for violation
of their kids' civil rights.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.554
You tell them that if we
don't contain this now,

11:27.554 --> 11:28.889
there'll be images
of their children

11:28.889 --> 11:31.391
on the internet for eternity.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.526
And what is
your passcode, Chloe?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.495
Are you gonna
wipe my phone?

11:35.495 --> 11:40.133
I just got to level 386
on Candy Crush.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.869
1097,
1097.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.470
Write down your username

11:43.470 --> 11:45.005
and password for Facebook,
Instagram, Snapchat--

11:45.005 --> 11:46.774
What?
You have no right to ask--

11:46.774 --> 11:48.776
Leo, write them down.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.379
This is good.
You can read a book.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.381
You left some lines
blank, Jaden.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.784
I don't want the NYPD
reading my blog.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.085
Yeah, don't worry
about that.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.387
Gabriel Dole. Where is he?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.454
Home sick.
I'm his mother.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.823
I have his cell.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.092
Well, we need his passwords,
Mrs. Dole.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.995
Trudy Malko.
I'm happily uncoupled.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.298
Well, is there a landline
where your son is?

12:11.298 --> 12:14.467
Call him. Come back
when you've filled this out.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.203
Okay.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.475
I'm finding this
very invasive, Hannah.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.278
I'm sure you don't want
sexually explicit images

12:25.278 --> 12:27.580
of Gabriel going viral
on the internet, Trudy.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.649
It's for your son's
protection.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.051
Well, shouldn't that
be my call, then?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.821
Not if it involves
child pornography charges.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.523
It must be stressful
to spend so much time

12:36.523 --> 12:38.358
in such a dark world.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.832
She's...got
a lifestyle website.

12:44.832 --> 12:48.635
She reviews holistic treatments,
herbal therapies.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.670
She's the queen bee
of the Tribeca moms.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.440
Well,
there's one in every hive.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.643
[phone vibrates]

12:56.643 --> 12:58.645
Oh, excuse me.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.214
Dr. Lee.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.083
No, Noah's home
with the babysitter.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.252
Why? Is everything okay?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.059
He was exposed to
measles? How?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.726
Another patient
in the waiting room.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.129
And Noah may have been exposed.
Let's not panic.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.297
He was just vaccinated
yesterday.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.466
Which is good,
but the vaccine takes time

13:19.466 --> 13:20.968
to go into full effect.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.636
No fever so far,
also a good sign.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.874
This patient that he was
exposed to, was it Aiden Dole?

13:26.874 --> 13:28.408
He has an older brother,
Gabriel.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.077
- I'm sorry, I can't say.
- Of course.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.312
I understand.
So what now?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.982
Is there anything I can do
preventative?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.884
I mean,
with his respiratory issues?

13:36.884 --> 13:39.286
I'd like you
to quarantine him at home.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.753
No exposure
to other children.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.223
Adults who have been
vaccinated are fine.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.291
For how long?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.926
Eight days to start.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.396
I know that with your job
it will be difficult.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.132
We'll do whatever
we have to, right?

13:52.132 --> 13:55.102
Come here, little man.

14:01.008 --> 14:01.141
.

14:02.910 --> 14:03.376
Thank you guys
for coming.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.647
Just put that stuff
on any surface you can find.

14:07.647 --> 14:11.184
Chief says you can work from
here as long as you need, Liv.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.153
[Noah crying]
Hey, how's Noah doing?

14:13.153 --> 14:16.924
You know, he's cranky
and he's sluggish.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.358
So just keeping my fingers
crossed.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.661
Lucy's here helping me out.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.197
So how was the cell phone
retrieval?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.433
Rollins and Carisi
are sorting through with TARU.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.135
May be short a few phones.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.070
I'll talk to
Principal Schwartz.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.804
You know,
on another issue--

14:31.804 --> 14:33.606
Noah's exposure to measles

14:33.606 --> 14:35.808
may have come
from a Tribeca Academy student.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.478
It's in D.C. and Jersey.
It's bound to come here.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.381
Look, Zara's school in L.A.
is ground zero for anti-vaxxers.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.050
Hey,
has Gil been vaccinated?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.452
Well, I wasn't around
when he was one.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.621
I'm picking him up
this afternoon.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.490
Yeah, I'll put in a call
to his mom.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.259
[Noah crying in background]

14:54.527 --> 14:55.795
Gil.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.734
Good to see you.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.336
- Want some?
- What?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.038
No, no thanks.

15:05.038 --> 15:10.077
So, uh, I talked
to your mom earlier today.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.412
You talk about
us moving?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.681
Moving?
What do you mean?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.749
Maybe she don't want
you to know yet.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.651
Know what?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.988
Hey, you can tell
me anything.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
You know that.
What...

15:22.990 --> 15:28.195
She says we're moving
to San Diego in July.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.997
Well, she say why?

15:29.997 --> 15:32.399
The gangs in the neighborhood
are getting bad.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.001
But I don't want to go.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.568
I'll never see you again.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.704
Maybe you can talk to her.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.006
I will.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.807
Hey, and don't you worry.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.910
You're gonna
see me no matter what.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.246
It's all gonna be fine.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.382
Excuse me,
just a moment.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.252
[background chatter]

15:52.252 --> 15:53.920
This is an unmitigated
disaster.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.855
It's not ideal.
Can we talk in your office?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.024
That's not a good idea
right now.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.725
Walk me through
this again.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.228
Okay, TARU used the photos
from the kids' phones

16:01.228 --> 16:03.330
that we confiscated to run
a reverse image search.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.932
- How many hits?
- We don't know, but a lot.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.500
They're already posted
on RedChanIt,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.036
dark net kiddie porn sites.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.703
Some middle school idiot
uploaded these images

16:10.703 --> 16:12.305
after we explicitly
said not to?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.506
Why am I not surprised?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.275
My mother calls it
"teenacity."

16:15.275 --> 16:17.577
And TARU can't trace it back

16:17.577 --> 16:19.046
to any of the devices
in custody?

16:19.046 --> 16:20.480
No.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.582
Are there devices
not in custody?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.184
By our count, there's seven.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.519
Two from the party -
Savannah Biel, Hudson Cuesta.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.057
One 16-year-old, Larry Heller,
and a few more 14-year-olds.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.324
Some of the parents
were making noise

16:31.324 --> 16:32.359
about civil rights violations.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.726
I don't want to say
I told you so--

16:33.726 --> 16:35.395
Then don't. It's just
as likely their parents

16:35.395 --> 16:37.764
are worried that their kids are
circulating child pornography.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.532
So you guys
need warrants for all seven?

16:39.532 --> 16:42.069
That's why we're here.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.071
I realize the situation
is serious,

16:44.071 --> 16:45.405
but not all of these parents

16:45.405 --> 16:47.140
are being deliberately
uncooperative.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.877
Savannah Biel and Hudson Cuesta
were home sick yesterday.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.145
With measles?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.481
That's confidential,
Detective.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.918
We've notified the CDC and are
proceeding according to policy.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.353
Okay,
and how about Larry Heller?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.422
The other tenth grader?
Is he home sick too?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.824
No, his mother's a lawyer.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.126
Arlene Heller.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.394
[groans]

17:07.394 --> 17:09.729
She was Walter Briggs'
widow's attorney.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.264
Kind of a live wire.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.300
Did you tell her
that we have a warrant?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.768
She didn't let me
get that far.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.470
I didn't know
you had a kid, Counselor.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.106
Don't remind me.
A kid, a cat,

17:19.106 --> 17:21.174
and a client at 5:00,
so let's get this over with.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.310
You have a warrant
for my kid's cell phone?

17:23.310 --> 17:26.179
What is this, 1984?
He wasn't at the party.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.747
Look at him!
He's on the chess team.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.249
Well, he's still gonna
have to comply.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.284
All right.
Give 'em the damn phone, Larry.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.120
I-I can't, I lost it.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.421
What? That's it.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.256
You're done, Larry.
I swear to God.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.924
This is the third one
in eight months.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.693
- Is one of these your locker?
- I--

17:40.693 --> 17:42.462
'Cause maybe you left it
in your locker

17:42.462 --> 17:43.996
and you don't remember?

17:43.996 --> 17:45.432
The warrant covers
his locker.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.135
Open it, Larry.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.137
I really lost it.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.311
It's really not
in here.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.583
[cell phone rings]

18:03.583 --> 18:06.153
You're dumber than your father,
you know that?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.162
(Trudy)
Instead of sending
alarmist emails about measles,

18:15.162 --> 18:18.398
the school needs to reexamine
their walkaway lunch policy.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.633
My problem is the drinking--
Where did the alcohol

18:20.633 --> 18:21.701
- come from?
- [apartment buzzer]

18:21.701 --> 18:23.936
Not here.
I checked every bottle.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.605
I heard one of the boys
brought it.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.640
It wasn't Gabriel.
I asked.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.409
You know what
worries me?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.244
If the kids
can smuggle in booze,

18:31.244 --> 18:33.180
who's to say next time
it won't be a knife or a gun?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.814
It's outrageous.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.249
(Rollins)
Detective Rollins,
Detective Carisi.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.885
Oh, um...I'll buzz you in.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.388
Haven't they pried into
our kids' private lives enough?

18:41.388 --> 18:42.922
We're responsible parents.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.957
The police don't need
to act like the CIA.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.995
Can I help you?

18:48.995 --> 18:50.830
Yeah, your daughter
wasn't at school yesterday

18:50.830 --> 18:52.432
and we have a warrant
for her cell phone.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.267
She told me
she deleted the photos.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.968
Maybe we could just
talk to her.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.239
No, she's resting.
She's home sick today too.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.341
It wouldn't happen to be
with the measles, would it?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.875
Did the school tell you that?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.677
So she does have measles.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.480
Wait here.
I'll get you her phone.

19:10.850 --> 19:15.755
So some images
ended up on porn sites.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.324
Can we stop this
from spreading?

19:17.324 --> 19:18.925
You know how it goes, Liv.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.560
Once you put it out there,
you can't pull it back.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.994
Well, the legit sites
have taken 'em down,

19:21.994 --> 19:22.995
but they've gone viral.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.397
Rollins and Carisi

19:24.397 --> 19:26.333
are retrieving
the last of the phones.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.268
TARU should be able to find out
which student linked them.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.437
Then what? Arrest them?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.604
They're 15 years old.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.340
And white. And rich.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.875
It's not gonna happen.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.444
We all know it's true.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.380
So how's little man?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.748
I couldn't get him down
for his nap.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.616
- He's running a fever.
- But you know,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.252
two of the kids
who didn't turn in their phones

19:45.252 --> 19:46.953
were out sick.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.255
Kids from the party?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.857
Yeah, Rollins
thought they might have measles.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.792
How? They had to have been
vaccinated.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.262
Liv! Liv,
I gave Noah his inhaler,

19:55.262 --> 19:56.629
but he's still having
trouble breathing.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.265
He's--he's turning blue.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.466
Call 911!

19:59.466 --> 20:00.800
I'll get the car.
It's faster.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.769
Yeah,
we'll meet you out front.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.938
16 months, cyanotic.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.540
Start him on oxygen.
We may need to intubate.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.875
[Noah cries]
It's okay, Noah.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.610
It's okay, sweetie.
You're gonna be okay.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.312
It's okay, my love.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.714
- It's okay, my love.
- Olivia, you have to wait here.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.316
- No no, I'm going in.
- Not now.

20:16.316 --> 20:19.151
I'll let you know as soon
as we stabilize him.

20:32.399 --> 20:32.532
.

20:40.139 --> 20:40.607
- Hey.
- Any word?

20:41.808 --> 20:43.910
Yeah, they want to keep
him on oxygen.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.178
Dr. Lee's in there
with him now.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.782
Nick,
you don't have to stay.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.250
Fin's on his way.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.785
As soon as he gets here,
I'll punch out.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.121
Okay.

20:55.121 --> 20:58.257
- Hey, how is he?
- Noah's sedated.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.759
He's stabilized,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.228
but I noted Koplik's spots
in his mouth.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.397
First signs of measles.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.669
So what happens next?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.738
He'll develop a rash
on his body within a day or two,

21:11.738 --> 21:13.773
and we'll keep him here
under observation.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.007
Can I see him?

21:15.007 --> 21:17.444
- I'll get you a gown.
- Okay.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.878
Thanks.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.221
I think I feel warm.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.057
Hey, Rollins.
Feel my forehead.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.959
- I'm not feeling your forehead.
- Come on.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.361
Okay, thank you.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.266
Oh, wait.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.069
You got a little something here.
And there.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.737
Seriously?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.639
Another one here.
[gasps]

21:46.639 --> 21:48.608
Okay, that's not funny.
All right?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.377
Measles is one of the most
infectious diseases

21:50.377 --> 21:52.278
on the planet.
It's airborne, Rollins.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.747
It lives on surfaces
like cell phones for hours.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.248
But Carisi,
you're vaccinated, right?

21:56.248 --> 21:58.618
Yeah,
but that's not 100% effective.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.086
Look, I got an update
from TARU.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.721
They trace
that teen pornographer?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.122
Yeah. Larry Heller.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.391
The kid is not so bright.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.393
The mom was right.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.695
His cell phone serial number
was embedded in the photos.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.296
His mother's got a mouth
on her.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.898
Who wants to give her
the good news?

22:11.898 --> 22:13.733
Let's pass this one
off to Barba.

22:13.733 --> 22:14.867
She's a lawyer.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.405
Professional courtesy.

22:18.405 --> 22:21.708
Okay, Larry's a screw-up.
He is not a child pornographer.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.910
The four sites your son
disseminated those images to

22:23.910 --> 22:24.977
thought he was.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.679
Disseminated?
Are you serious?

22:26.679 --> 22:29.582
Dissemination charges put him on
the sex registry till he's 40.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.084
Those photos were geo-tagged,
putting these kids,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.586
and others, in danger.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.221
You wanna talk about kids
in danger?

22:35.221 --> 22:37.189
The kids at that party
are in danger.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.758
From measles.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.694
Gabriel Dole,
Savannah Biel, Hudson Cuesta.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.763
And I heard half a dozen others
have come down with it.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.532
Spreading measles
isn't a crime.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.635
No? These hippy-dippy moms
never vaccinated their kids

22:48.635 --> 22:49.902
and lied about it.

22:49.902 --> 22:53.205
15 years later,
half my son's class is infected.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.541
You have any proof they lied?

22:54.541 --> 22:55.808
Hello?

22:55.808 --> 22:58.878
New York requires every kid
in school to be immunized.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.613
So how is this spreading?

23:00.613 --> 23:04.083
Those moms colluded to find ways
around the vaccine mandate.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.785
Colluding?
You think they're part of

23:05.785 --> 23:07.119
some anti-vaxxer conspiracy?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.688
Okay, don't make me out
to be paranoid.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.590
There could be a measles
epidemic in New York

23:10.590 --> 23:13.192
while you people are conducting
a lipstick porn witch hunt.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.827
Counselor, breathe.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.363
We're not looking
to put your son on the registry.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.799
But he doesn't just
get a free pass.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.501
He's 16 years old.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.704
These online sickos
are using him.

23:24.704 --> 23:29.308
How about he cooperates
and you go after them?

23:31.844 --> 23:34.547
And he testifies.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.716
If need be.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.852
So unless you're planning
to perp walk Larry,

23:39.852 --> 23:40.853
we're done here.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.254
We'll be in touch.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.727
She called our bluff.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.961
And that measles misdirect.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.329
Offense is the best defense.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.899
Yeah, but she
may not be blowing smoke.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.166
Noah's in the hospital.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.402
What does that have
to do with Tribeca Academy?

23:56.402 --> 23:58.304
Well, I think he might've been
infected by the younger sibling

23:58.304 --> 24:00.039
of one of the boys at the party.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.142
Maybe these kids
had a vaccination exemption.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.711
I don't want to pull a Carisi,

24:04.711 --> 24:07.313
but we could be looking
at reckless endangerment.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.016
Find out if we are.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.153
(Principal Schwartz)
Seven students
confirmed with measles,

24:14.153 --> 24:16.122
at least four others possible.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.390
We've closed down for the rest
of the week as a precaution.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.959
Aren't the kids
supposed to be vaccinated?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.061
Yes, they are.
I checked every health form.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.764
We only have two medical
exemptions, for allergies.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.298
Both sophomores, both healthy.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.067
What about religious
exemptions or personal belief,

24:28.067 --> 24:29.636
like California?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.070
We don't allow
personal belief exemptions.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.772
And as for religious exemptions,

24:32.772 --> 24:34.674
New York State
makes those very hard to get.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.644
Well, even so, do you mind
if we look through the forms?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.749
(Fin)
All these records
are signed by an M.D.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.950
Of course they are.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.085
No one starts the school year
without that.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.920
I got four
of the infected kids.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.089
Different ages,
records dated and signed.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.123
The paperwork looks right.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.159
Five, six, seven...

24:53.159 --> 24:55.261
I can't make out
some of these signatures,

24:55.261 --> 24:57.029
but they're all
of the same address.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.799
Hudson Park Pediatrics.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.101
All four of mine
are also Hudson Park Pediatrics.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.571
The network's pretty tight
in a small school like this.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.138
These families share
the same tutors,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.240
[phone chimes]
piano teachers, doctors.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.610
Oh, God.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.713
Two more confirmed
for measles.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.381
Hmm.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.450
Nine kids from the same
pediatric practice.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.086
The CDC knows? Good.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.054
Now you gotta talk
to that doctor.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.756
I got Noah's latest
blood work back.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.958
His sed rate
and white blood count are up,

25:25.958 --> 25:27.426
and I listened to his lungs.

25:27.426 --> 25:29.428
He's fighting
a respiratory infection.

25:29.428 --> 25:32.231
- Do you think it's pneumonia?
- I'm not sure.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.400
I want to start him
on an antibiotic right away.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.368
He's been on them
so many times.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.770
At this point,
I'd rather shoot first

25:37.770 --> 25:39.138
and ask questions later.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.207
Your son really doesn't need
his third bout with pneumonia

25:41.207 --> 25:42.609
in his first two years.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.911
I know, I know.
Hold on, Dr. Lee.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.378
One more thing, um...

25:46.378 --> 25:48.781
Do you know
a Dr. Eric Setrakian,

25:48.781 --> 25:50.149
Hudson Park Pediatrics?

25:50.149 --> 25:52.652
He's old-school.
Likes to Ferberize.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.787
Doesn't over-medicate
or over-test.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.656
Parents love him.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.996
Of course I've heard
about the measles outbreak.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.798
How is this a police matter?

26:05.798 --> 26:09.702
Well, nine of the kids at
that school have been infected,

26:09.702 --> 26:12.238
and they were all
vaccinated here.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.740
Wow.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.376
You guys
are doing due diligence, huh?

26:17.376 --> 26:18.745
I'll check the records.

26:18.745 --> 26:24.984
You do know that the MMR vaccine
isn't 100% effective?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.886
Still, nine kids?

26:26.886 --> 26:30.990
We're talking about a period
of over 10 years.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.325
I can't tell you
how many doctors have rotated

26:33.325 --> 26:35.561
through the practice
in that time.

26:35.561 --> 26:38.831
But you've always been here.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.200
Let me look into this
for you.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.534
- Hmm.
- In the meantime,

26:42.534 --> 26:44.971
I have a full waiting room.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.040
Thank you.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.176
He's lying, stonewalling,
or both.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.679
If he did fake
the immunization records,

26:52.679 --> 26:54.681
- the mothers have to know.
- Yeah.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.016
Of course my daughter
was vaccinated.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.885
But as I'm sure you know,
the vaccine

26:58.885 --> 27:01.253
- isn't completely effective.
- Well, you know, that's funny,

27:01.253 --> 27:03.823
'cause Dr. Setrakian
said the same thing.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.692
You spoke
with our pediatrician?

27:05.692 --> 27:07.493
- What gives you the right?
- A number of his patients,

27:07.493 --> 27:09.261
including Savannah,
have become infected.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.464
So we think he may have been
deliberately falsifying records.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.833
You know anything about that?

27:13.833 --> 27:15.301
I have to take care
of my daughter.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.905
Mom? What's going on?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.709
I picked up some soup
and honeysuckle tea.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.876
I'll be right there.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.281
We were just having fun.

27:29.281 --> 27:33.119
That loser Larry
ruined it for everyone.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.921
Go back to your room,
Savannah.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.422
[coughs]

27:39.125 --> 27:41.227
Do you want to tell us
what's going on?

27:41.227 --> 27:42.862
I think you should go now.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.764
We can go.
We can also get our D.A.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.332
to take another look
at your daughter

27:46.332 --> 27:48.400
for promoting child
pornography.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.175
You don't understand.
She was just a baby.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.344
The chemicals,
the threat of autism.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.747
I tried a religious exemption,
but it was denied.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.415
So you asked Dr. Setrakian
to falsify your records.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.551
It wasn't my idea.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.420
Just tell us
whose idea this was.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.626
Thank you for seeing us,
Ms. Malko.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.763
I brought our ADA
Rafael Barba.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.597
Is this about that party?

28:18.597 --> 28:20.099
I can assure you
the parents association

28:20.099 --> 28:21.300
is dealing with the school.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.769
We just have
some questions.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.103
So how is your son doing?

28:24.103 --> 28:25.905
He's out of the woods.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.974
This has been stressful
for Colleen.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.642
I've always insisted
that Gabriel be raised in ways

28:30.642 --> 28:32.411
that strengthen
his natural immunity.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.547
Is that why he was never
vaccinated?

28:36.883 --> 28:39.685
We can subpoena
a blood sample.

28:39.685 --> 28:43.122
The risks of vaccination
outweigh the benefits.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.390
When Gabriel was born,

28:44.390 --> 28:46.225
I tried to get a medical
or religious exemption,

28:46.225 --> 28:47.693
but I couldn't get either one.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.629
So that's why you had Dr.
Setrakian lie on his records?

28:50.629 --> 28:53.365
He believes parents
should have the right to decide

28:53.365 --> 28:54.801
what's best for their children.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.168
Did you recommend him
to other families

28:56.168 --> 28:57.303
looking to get around
the law?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.705
The law is unjust.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.408
As a mother protecting my child,
I can't tell you

29:02.408 --> 29:04.343
how many mothers
thank me for what I'm doing.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.145
Doing?

29:06.145 --> 29:09.148
So you're still steering parents
to Dr. Setrakian?

29:11.717 --> 29:13.419
Okay, we're gonna
need their names.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.287
I won't betray them.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.289
The AMA, the CDC,
the Board of Health,

29:17.289 --> 29:20.126
the Department of Education--
they are the villains here.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.861
- Go after them.
- After them?

29:21.861 --> 29:24.596
You're encouraging
other parents.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.434
You are endangering the health
of every child in this city.

29:29.601 --> 29:33.840
So this is personal?
Because your son took ill,

29:33.840 --> 29:35.641
you and you
are coming after me?

29:35.641 --> 29:38.744
No, this has nothing to do
with Sergeant Benson's son.

29:38.744 --> 29:40.646
You are openly flouting
the law.

29:53.960 --> 29:54.093
.

29:55.761 --> 29:56.595
On the counts
of reckless endangerment,

29:57.864 --> 29:59.665
conspiracy,
and falsifying business records

29:59.665 --> 30:02.568
in the second degree,
Trudy Malko, how do you plead?

30:02.568 --> 30:05.604
The only thing I'm pleading to
is doing what's best for my son.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.273
Not guilty, Your Honor.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.075
We request R.O.R.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.510
Ms. Malko has no priors, and she
has a sick child at home.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.145
Yep. He's sick due to

30:13.145 --> 30:14.580
Ms. Malko's own decision
not to vaccinate.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.515
My client has no intention
of fleeing.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.484
- She wants to fight her case.
- And win.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.353
Dr. Setrakian and I are willing
to risk our reputations,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.822
our livelihoods, to fight for
our rights against government--

30:23.822 --> 30:25.291
R.O.R. is granted.

30:25.291 --> 30:29.828
Mr. Roth, does your client share
the same view?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.930
Approach, Your Honor?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.664
Please.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.438
My client would like
to separate himself from

30:39.438 --> 30:40.940
Joan of Arc back there.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.110
Dr. Setrakian is nearing
retirement

30:44.110 --> 30:46.478
and is willing to plea
to reckless endangerment

30:46.478 --> 30:47.980
in the second

30:47.980 --> 30:50.182
if Mr. Barba will take prison
off the table.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.518
So he can move his act
to Florida?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.786
I'll accept if he gives us
the names of all the patients

30:54.786 --> 30:56.889
whose records he falsified,
forfeits his license,

30:56.889 --> 31:00.226
and agrees to testify
against Ms. Malko.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.961
I'm sure
that won't be a problem.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.064
(judge)
We're done.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.568
Hey, Barba,
you got a minute?

31:09.568 --> 31:12.038
- Barely, what's up?
- Quick update.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.272
Turns out
the counselor's son's

31:13.272 --> 31:14.706
actually a pretty
good CI.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.175
He's got six pedophiles
on the hook,

31:16.175 --> 31:17.643
all willing to exchange
pornographic files.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.545
- We're talking zip drives--
- Great, reel 'em in.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.947
Let TARU track
'em down.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.215
So after this,
you're done with Larry?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.417
Unless I need him
to testify at trial,

31:25.417 --> 31:27.286
- we're good.
- I'm relieved.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.555
Did you ever follow up
with Typhoid Trudy

31:29.555 --> 31:31.623
or the other
anti-vaxxer moms?

31:31.623 --> 31:32.691
You know the school
had to shut down

31:32.691 --> 31:34.426
to decontaminate?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.228
Turns out
you're a good CI too.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.264
Your friend, Trudy Malko,
just got arraigned.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.332
She'll get
her day in court.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.667
You're welcome!

31:44.971 --> 31:47.273
We heard testimony
from Dr. Eric Setrakian,

31:47.273 --> 31:50.142
as well as numerous parents
that the defendant, Trudy Malko,

31:50.142 --> 31:53.079
conspired to falsify
vaccination records.

31:53.079 --> 31:56.315
Dr. Rudnick, is measles still
a dangerous illness?

31:56.315 --> 31:58.985
Very. On top of having
a higher infection rate

31:58.985 --> 32:01.053
than Ebola, the virus
can lead to pneumonia,

32:01.053 --> 32:04.456
bronchitis,
even encephalitis or death.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.825
Prosecution Exhibit J,
Your Honor.

32:06.825 --> 32:10.562
A CDC transmission map of
the current Manhattan outbreak.

32:10.562 --> 32:15.601
Dr. Rudnick, what does
this first red dot indicate?

32:15.601 --> 32:18.170
That's Tribeca Academy,
the school Patient Zero,

32:18.170 --> 32:19.871
the defendant's son, attends.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.008
And how did the defendant's
son become Patient Zero?

32:22.008 --> 32:24.443
The CDC determined
he contracted measles

32:24.443 --> 32:26.645
on a recent trip to
the under-vaccinated community

32:26.645 --> 32:29.215
of Pacific Palisades.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.749
What do these dots represent?

32:30.749 --> 32:33.319
The residences
of Tribeca Academy classmates

32:33.319 --> 32:36.322
who contracted measles
from Patient Zero.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.923
And these dots?

32:37.923 --> 32:41.727
The 48 confirmed cases
of measles around the city.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.262
Have you had any cases
in individuals

32:43.262 --> 32:44.563
who were actually vaccinated?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.565
None.
All were unvaccinated.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.866
Thank you so much, Doctor.

32:47.866 --> 32:51.503
No further questions,
Your Honor.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.673
Dr. Rudnick, do you happen
to know the number of children

32:54.673 --> 32:57.076
who are killed by vaccines
each year?

32:57.076 --> 32:58.210
No.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.411
How many families
are compensated

32:59.411 --> 33:01.447
by the U.S. Department
of Health's

33:01.447 --> 33:04.650
own Vaccine
Injury Compensation Fund?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.918
I don't know.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.855
Can you even tell me
any of the known side effects

33:09.855 --> 33:12.524
of the MMR vaccine?

33:12.524 --> 33:14.426
Side effects are
mostly mild.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.629
But the more serious ones
include vasculitis,

33:17.629 --> 33:19.698
pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.068
Can you tell the jury
the percentage

33:22.068 --> 33:25.504
of vaccinated children who
experienced these side effects?

33:25.504 --> 33:29.275
Those side effects
are statistically insignificant.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.610
Some one in a million.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.814
Tell that to the parents
of a child who's actually

33:35.814 --> 33:38.084
experiencing them.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.551
Nothing further.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.656
Because of my son's
respiratory issues,

33:44.656 --> 33:46.825
his pediatrician
recommended that he be

33:46.825 --> 33:48.860
quarantined post-exposure.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.529
How was he exposed?

33:50.529 --> 33:52.231
Through another patient
in the waiting room.

33:52.231 --> 33:56.635
The CDC has confirmed
through epidemiological testing

33:56.635 --> 33:59.538
that Noah's exposure
came from Patient Zero.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.140
Objection.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.310
The Sergeant is not a doctor
or a medical researcher.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.544
Sustained.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.214
Jury will disregard.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.583
Sergeant Benson,
can you describe your son's

34:11.583 --> 34:12.818
- complications?
- Yes.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.721
He was having difficulty
breathing.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.124
He then had to
be hospitalized.

34:18.124 --> 34:21.260
He was then diagnosed
with measles

34:21.260 --> 34:23.762
and has since developed
pneumonia,

34:23.762 --> 34:26.232
and he is still
in pediatric ICU.

34:26.232 --> 34:29.568
Thank you.
Thank you for testifying today.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.973
Sergeant, I'm sorry
your son is sick.

34:34.973 --> 34:38.510
Now, is it possible
that his exposure is the reason

34:38.510 --> 34:42.013
you had your department
pursue this case?

34:42.013 --> 34:44.550
Ms. Malko led
a coordinated effort

34:44.550 --> 34:47.853
to hide unimmunized students
in a New York City school.

34:47.853 --> 34:51.357
That rises to the level
of child endangerment.

34:51.357 --> 34:55.494
A conclusion you reached
after your son fell ill.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.597
Are you aware that many people
believe giving vaccines

34:58.597 --> 35:01.467
to young children actually
compromises their immune system?

35:01.467 --> 35:04.170
That's a completely
unfounded theory.

35:04.170 --> 35:07.739
Vaccines build immunity.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.940
Your son--I'm sorry,

35:08.940 --> 35:11.610
your foster son--
is 16 months, yes?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.712
Just shy of 16, yes.

35:13.712 --> 35:17.516
So if you believe
that vaccines build immunity,

35:17.516 --> 35:19.351
and your son
is immuno-compromised,

35:19.351 --> 35:21.953
why didn't you vaccinate him
as early as recommended?

35:21.953 --> 35:24.390
- At 12 months?
- Because my pediatrician

35:24.390 --> 35:27.092
decided to delay
his immunizations

35:27.092 --> 35:29.295
because of his compromised
immune system.

35:29.295 --> 35:33.199
We were at the doctor's office
waiting to get his MMR

35:33.199 --> 35:34.800
when he was exposed.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.868
You are blaming my client
for your son's illness,

35:36.868 --> 35:40.206
but you are the one
who chose to delay his MMR.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.573
- My pediatrician--
- Did you think

35:41.573 --> 35:43.975
it was the best possible
decision to wait?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.544
- Yes, I did.
- Just like Ms. Malko

35:45.544 --> 35:48.780
thought it best
not to vaccinate her son at all?

35:53.084 --> 35:54.753
No further questions.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.726
I'm not panicking.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.962
Okay, I'm on my way.
Thank you.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.997
Sergeant Benson,
I was hoping to find you.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.866
Ms. Malko,
this really isn't a good time.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.235
I know this is difficult
for you,

36:09.235 --> 36:10.602
but your son
will get through this.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.404
He'll never get
measles again,

36:12.404 --> 36:14.340
and he'll be stronger because
his body did it all on its own.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.242
You really don't want to get
into this with me right now.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.643
My son is suffering.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.345
They're upping his antibiotics.

36:19.345 --> 36:20.846
Overexposure to antibiotics

36:20.846 --> 36:22.414
may be why his immune system
is so weak.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.849
That's another thing
you should think about.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.017
You may want to think
about shutting your mouth.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.721
My son wouldn't have pneumonia
if it weren't for you.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.357
Liv--Liv!
Is everything all right?

36:31.357 --> 36:33.825
No. His fever is spiking.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.261
And if it doesn't come down,

36:43.302 --> 36:43.435
.

36:44.069 --> 36:44.903
I'm sorry for anyone
whose child is sick,

36:46.338 --> 36:48.173
including Sergeant Benson.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.776
Many experts believe
that western medicine,

36:50.776 --> 36:53.312
the overuse of antibiotics
and vaccines

36:53.312 --> 36:55.180
actually
impose unnecessary risks

36:55.180 --> 36:57.148
to the wellness of children.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.717
Have you personally
experienced

36:58.717 --> 37:00.419
the harmful effects
vaccines can have?

37:00.419 --> 37:01.587
Yes.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.822
My nephew, Braedon,
is 18.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.693
Around his first birthday,
after he received the 23 doses

37:07.693 --> 37:10.329
of vaccinations recommended
by his pediatrician,

37:10.329 --> 37:11.963
he regressed into autism.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.601
And how do you know his autism
was caused by vaccines?

37:15.601 --> 37:18.970
A few days after
his first MMR vaccination,

37:18.970 --> 37:20.806
Braedon changed.

37:20.806 --> 37:24.776
He had been such a bright,
lively, engaged little boy.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.313
And then, suddenly, he wasn't.

37:27.313 --> 37:30.882
My sister and I saw the light
disappearing from his eyes.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.484
My own son
was born a year later,

37:32.484 --> 37:34.152
and I swore I would do
anything

37:34.152 --> 37:35.821
to protect him from
what had happened to my nephew.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.556
So everything you have done

37:37.556 --> 37:40.392
has been in the spirit of saving
children, not endangering them?

37:40.392 --> 37:42.761
Yes. Absolutely.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.330
Vaccines
are potentially harmful,

37:44.330 --> 37:45.897
and once they're administered,
they can't be reversed.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.800
All I'm advocating for
is the right of every parent

37:48.800 --> 37:50.802
to weigh the risks
and make that decision

37:50.802 --> 37:52.804
for their own child.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.906
Thank you, Ms. Malko.

37:57.376 --> 38:00.512
Ms. Malko, did you know
that the

38:00.512 --> 38:03.949
Institute for Medicine,
the CDC,

38:03.949 --> 38:07.085
and numerous other research
groups have found no links

38:07.085 --> 38:09.120
between vaccines and autism?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.256
I don't trust the CDC
or Big Pharma.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.824
There's overwhelming
evidence

38:12.824 --> 38:15.394
that thimerosal
was a causal agent of autism--

38:15.394 --> 38:17.963
That theory's been refuted,
and thimerosal was removed

38:17.963 --> 38:19.931
from vaccines in 2001.
Are you aware of that?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.667
I am aware of every argument

38:21.667 --> 38:23.935
used to ostracize and vilify
the so-called anti-vaxxers.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.371
Again, I'm not anti-science.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.805
I'm not against vaccines.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.574
I just believe it should be
a choice

38:28.574 --> 38:31.443
made by individual families,
not imposed by bureaucrats.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.746
Bureaucrats like the CDC
and the Department of Education?

38:34.746 --> 38:36.582
- That's right.
- Okay.

38:36.582 --> 38:40.419
New York City also mandates
that students not be allowed

38:40.419 --> 38:43.489
to bring weapons such as knives
or guns to school.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.691
- Do you agree with that policy?
- Yes.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.493
What about, say,

38:47.493 --> 38:50.629
not sending children to school
with so much as a single peanut

38:50.629 --> 38:52.764
to protect anyone
with allergies.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.999
Do you agree with that?

38:53.999 --> 38:55.534
- Of course.
- Okay.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.536
So if a mother wanted to make
her child a peanut butter

38:57.536 --> 38:59.605
sandwich for lunch,
you would deny her that choice

38:59.605 --> 39:01.640
because it might endanger
other children.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.409
Yes.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.612
But denying a child peanut
butter for lunch causes no harm.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.580
Vaccines are harmful.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.583
Not according
to medical science.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.419
But, as we've seen,

39:13.419 --> 39:16.422
not vaccinating children
causes serious medical harm,

39:16.422 --> 39:17.623
not just in your son's school.

39:17.623 --> 39:20.058
All over the city.

39:20.058 --> 39:24.430
At last count, 5,500 people
have been exposed to this virus.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.897
Who knows
how many more will get sick?

39:25.897 --> 39:27.866
It's my child. My right.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.735
My decision.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.570
But you didn't just make a
decision for yourself, did you?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.639
You made a decision
that endangered everyone else.

39:33.639 --> 39:34.840
- Your Honor.
- What gives you the right

39:34.840 --> 39:37.075
- to take away their choice?
- Objection.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.678
- Mr. Barba.
- Nothing further.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.826
Hey, you heard
anything about Noah?

39:54.826 --> 39:57.896
Yeah, they're holding off
on the spinal tap for now.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.798
- Well, that's good, right?
- Yeah.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.669
How's Liv?
I can't even imagine.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.337
You know, in the middle of
all this, she had to remind me

40:06.337 --> 40:08.874
to make sure that Gil
and Zara were vaccinated.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.341
They were, right?

40:10.341 --> 40:12.478
Yeah.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.546
Cynthia told me

40:14.546 --> 40:16.648
that she's worried
about Gil's middle school.

40:16.648 --> 40:19.384
They have family in San Diego.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.920
She and Gil might move there.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.089
Maybe it'll be good
for 'em.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.491
Well, not for me.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.092
Look, I want to be part
of his life.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.060
I mean, I want to be a father
to him.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.496
Okay, but you do what you do
with Zara.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.630
You call. You write.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.664
You visit.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.534
Right. It's just--

40:35.534 --> 40:37.669
I'm trying so hard
to make everything work.

40:37.669 --> 40:40.606
Does anything ever get easier?

40:40.606 --> 40:42.007
Not that I've heard.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.341
Sorry to interrupt.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.211
(both)
You're not interrupting.

40:46.211 --> 40:48.480
Okay. Jury's back.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.229
On the charge
of reckless endangerment

41:04.229 --> 41:06.965
in the first degree,
how do you find?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.968
We find the defendant
not guilty.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.238
[commotion]

41:15.541 --> 41:18.176
Order.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.679
On the charge of one count
reckless endangerment

41:20.679 --> 41:23.915
in the second, how do you find?

41:23.915 --> 41:26.785
We find the defendant guilty.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.554
[commotion]
- What?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.370
They should've hit her
with the felony count.

41:45.370 --> 41:49.575
She got three months
in jail, nine months probation.

41:49.575 --> 41:50.642
How's Noah doing?

41:51.843 --> 41:53.579
I think the worst
is over.

41:53.579 --> 41:56.582
We should be home
in a day or two.
