That's a beautiful song, Linda.
Where's it from?

00:30.081 --> 00:31.548
No, Teddy, we
really are going

00:31.549 --> 00:33.017
to the accountant
to do our taxes.

00:33.018 --> 00:34.752
We probably
shouldn't have waited

00:34.753 --> 00:37.254
until the last possible moment
on the last possible day,

00:37.255 --> 00:39.023
but it is kind of
our tradition.

00:39.024 --> 00:41.258
Aw, that's true!
So special.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.960
I don't know
why you guys need an accountant.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.694
It's fun to do your own taxes.

00:44.729 --> 00:46.430
No. Mm... no.
It's fine.

00:46.431 --> 00:49.733
Our accountant isn't that
expensive, and he's really good.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.468
Or pretty good. He's fine.
Yeah.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.238
We go for an hour, we pretend
to laugh at his jokes.

00:54.239 --> 00:55.639
Ugh, the jokes.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.073
Then we're done
for the year.

00:57.108 --> 00:58.876
Why do you pretend to
laugh at his jokes?

00:58.877 --> 01:00.544
Well, he's in charge
of our money, Teddy.

01:00.545 --> 01:02.046
We have to be nice to him.

01:02.047 --> 01:03.580
I mean, I think
he takes away a dependent

01:03.581 --> 01:04.982
every time we don't laugh.

01:04.983 --> 01:07.618
Well, good luck with that.
I'm going down to the docks.

01:07.619 --> 01:09.085
I'm helping out
with Lobsterfest.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.687
Ugh. Lobsterfest.

01:10.722 --> 01:11.854
What's wrong with Lobsterfest?

01:11.890 --> 01:13.289
There's too much lobster.

01:13.325 --> 01:15.758
Yeah, that's this year's theme:
too much lobster!

01:15.794 --> 01:17.227
All right, well,
have fun.

01:17.228 --> 01:19.063
You, too, going
to the accountant.

01:19.064 --> 01:20.931
Hey, Accountantfest.
Too much taxes!

01:20.932 --> 01:22.299
Yup.
(groans)

01:22.300 --> 01:24.000
Okay. Bye, Teddy!

01:30.842 --> 01:32.875
TINA:
<i>Whoa. Eye contact.</i>

01:32.911 --> 01:35.245
<i>Did I just have significant
E.C. with Joe Harrison?</i>

01:35.246 --> 01:37.080
<i>It felt like it.
That's weird.</i>

01:37.115 --> 01:39.083
<i>I barely know him. Hmm.</i>

01:39.084 --> 01:40.483
<i>Look at me again.</i>

01:40.518 --> 01:42.985
<i>Look at me. Look at me. Ugh!</i>

01:43.021 --> 01:44.788
Joe, where do you think
you're going?

01:44.789 --> 01:46.457
You have detention,
young man.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.458
(sighs)
Fine.

01:48.493 --> 01:49.726
TINA:
<i>Detention, huh?</i>

01:49.761 --> 01:51.462
Ugh! Reading is dumb!

01:51.463 --> 01:53.596
Tina, what is going on?
Your mom.

01:53.631 --> 01:55.432
What?!
Is dumb.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.999
And reading is dumb.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.369
You just earned
yourself detention.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.304
Got it.
Sorry about all that.

02:00.305 --> 02:02.005
Well, I'm sorry, too. Maybe
you don't need detention...

02:02.006 --> 02:04.440
Shove it!
Oh, okay, definitely detention.

02:04.476 --> 02:07.577
TINA: <i> Eyes on the prize,
which is Joe's eyes.</i>

02:07.612 --> 02:09.312
LINDA:
<i>I can't believe</i>

02:09.347 --> 02:10.881
Tina got detention.

02:10.882 --> 02:12.316
We needed her
to babysit you two.

02:12.317 --> 02:13.616
Mom, we've been
over this.

02:13.651 --> 02:15.519
Gene and I are
fine by ourselves.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.721
You let us babysit Aunt Gayle
whenever you go out of town,

02:17.722 --> 02:19.322
and she's a handful.

02:19.357 --> 02:22.126
Mm. I don't know.
Bob, what do you think?

02:22.127 --> 02:25.996
I guess. I mean, it is just
an hour, and we'll be close by.

02:25.997 --> 02:28.498
All right, but I'm
setting a lot of rules.

02:28.533 --> 02:30.033
Don't open the door
to anybody.

02:30.034 --> 02:32.069
What if it's a guy with a gun
and he really needs to pee?

02:32.070 --> 02:33.035
No.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.638
And don't use the stove
or knives

02:34.639 --> 02:36.205
or the bathtub or matches.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.207
Well, then how are we gonna
have a hot knife bath?

02:38.243 --> 02:39.810
And if anyone calls for us,

02:39.811 --> 02:41.979
say that we're home,
but we're... pooping.

02:41.980 --> 02:44.347
No, say I'm in the shower,
but I look good for my age.

02:44.382 --> 02:46.917
Guys, guys, we got it.
We'll be fine. I'm in charge.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.684
You don't have anything
to worry about.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.254
Well, technically,
Gene's in charge.

02:50.255 --> 02:52.321
He is?
I am? Yes.

02:52.357 --> 02:53.990
He's your big brother, Louise.

02:54.025 --> 02:55.426
I mean, big brother?

02:55.427 --> 02:57.594
I think of him more
as a large brother.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.496
No offense.
Yes, offense!

02:59.497 --> 03:00.998
It's just, you
don't really do

03:00.999 --> 03:02.833
the traditional
big brother stuff.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.369
You don't call me squirt,
you aren't good at baseball,

03:05.370 --> 03:07.404
and I have to give
<i>you</i> a piggyback ride

03:07.405 --> 03:08.872
when your legs get tired.

03:08.873 --> 03:10.473
Just 'cause
Dad's not strong enough.

03:10.508 --> 03:12.543
Louise, Gene is older
than you though,

03:12.544 --> 03:14.477
so I guess
your mother has a point.

03:14.512 --> 03:17.414
Yeah! I'm large <i> and</i>
in charge. Literally.

03:17.415 --> 03:19.283
(laughs):
Okay.

03:19.284 --> 03:21.018
(quietly): Don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on him.

03:21.019 --> 03:22.752
Now get out of here,
you crazy kids. Go!

03:22.787 --> 03:24.388
We'll be back
in an hour.

03:24.389 --> 03:25.789
Remember what I told you.
Yup.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.156
Okay, bye bye. Bye.
Yup.

03:27.192 --> 03:30.060
(door opens, closes)
So, forbidden snack time?

03:30.061 --> 03:32.662
As your king, I declare
them unforbidden!

03:32.697 --> 03:34.197
I like how you think.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.201
TINA:
<i>Moment of truth.</i>

03:37.202 --> 03:39.369
<i>It's just me and Joe.</i>

03:39.370 --> 03:41.071
<i>And all these other kids.</i>

03:41.072 --> 03:43.607
<i>Time to figure out
if lightning strikes twice.</i>

03:43.608 --> 03:45.007
<i>In our eyes.</i>

03:45.043 --> 03:47.044
<i>I have the perfect angle.</i>

03:47.045 --> 03:49.579
<i>Don't sit down there.
No, no, no, no. Damn it!</i>

03:49.614 --> 03:52.348
<i>Okay, okay,
I can maybe still see Joe.</i>

03:52.383 --> 03:53.784
<i>(groaning)</i>

03:53.785 --> 03:55.184
<i>Just a casual lean.</i>

03:55.220 --> 03:57.120
<i>No big deal.</i>

03:57.121 --> 03:58.254
<i>Almost there.</i>

03:58.289 --> 03:59.723
<i>Almost...</i>

03:59.724 --> 04:01.357
(gasps)
I'm okay.

04:01.392 --> 04:03.292
GERALD:
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-

04:03.328 --> 04:05.294
Ba-Ba-Belchers!

04:05.330 --> 04:07.930
Hey, guys. You pumped
to get these taxes done or what?

04:07.966 --> 04:10.366
Yup. Love 'em.
Love taxes. (whoops)

04:10.401 --> 04:13.003
Cool. 'Tis the season.
That's what I always say.

04:13.004 --> 04:15.872
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la tax. ♪

04:15.907 --> 04:18.207
(both laughing)

04:18.243 --> 04:20.577
You guys want some water
or anything before we get started?

04:20.577 --> 04:22.646
I'll have my secretary
grab some. Just kidding.

04:22.647 --> 04:24.213
I don't have a secretary.
(laughs)

04:24.249 --> 04:26.782
(chuckles)
Oh. It's very funny.

04:26.818 --> 04:28.151
You guys want
a butterscotch cookie?

04:28.152 --> 04:29.920
One of my clients
made them for me.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.220
They look delicioso.

04:31.256 --> 04:34.291
Mmm. Oh, my God,
these are good!

04:34.292 --> 04:36.593
Bob?
Uh, sure, I'll have one.

04:36.594 --> 04:39.128
Ooh, I'll have
one more. Mmm. Good.

04:39.163 --> 04:41.265
All right, let me just
pull out my tax-ophone.

04:41.266 --> 04:42.666
And tune it up.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.268
(imitating saxophone music)

04:44.269 --> 04:47.236
Okay, let's just
get started, could we?

04:47.272 --> 04:48.738
LOUISE:
<i>Okay, let's make sure</i>

04:48.773 --> 04:50.374
we're on the
same page here.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.943
We're making 17 layer dip, correct?
Correct.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.979
But we won't put in a 13th layer
because it's bad luck.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.648
I'm going to visit
the produce drawers

04:57.649 --> 04:59.115
and look for mom's
hidden bacon bits

04:59.150 --> 05:00.650
that she thinks
we don't know about.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.953
(gasps) Xanadu.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.555
Gene. Come. See.

05:04.556 --> 05:06.289
What is it?

05:06.324 --> 05:08.024
It's softer than

05:08.059 --> 05:09.493
the tops of Dad's legs.

05:09.494 --> 05:11.161
Oh, I know exactly
what it is.

05:11.162 --> 05:12.563
It's a cantaloupe.

05:12.564 --> 05:14.398
Remember when Mom put
it under her shirt

05:14.399 --> 05:16.066
at the grocery
store and pretended

05:16.067 --> 05:17.968
she had another boob, and
then they made her buy it?

05:17.969 --> 05:19.803
(gasps)
That was three years ago!

05:19.804 --> 05:22.072
We got to throw it.
Wh-What?

05:22.073 --> 05:24.508
We got to throw it off the fire
escape into the back alley.

05:24.509 --> 05:26.176
Yes! Wait, maybe no.

05:26.177 --> 05:28.512
This seems like
possibly a bad idea

05:28.513 --> 05:30.314
that could get us
into trouble.

05:30.315 --> 05:32.849
And I guess
I'm in charge, so...

05:32.850 --> 05:34.318
Gene, don't overthink it.

05:34.319 --> 05:36.152
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

05:36.187 --> 05:37.854
We've never been
home alone before,

05:37.855 --> 05:40.557
and we've never found
a rotten cantaloupe before.

05:40.558 --> 05:42.859
Are you saying this is
proof there's a God?

05:42.860 --> 05:44.528
I'm not saying it isn't.

05:44.529 --> 05:46.496
Gene, when life hands you
moldy melons,

05:46.497 --> 05:48.332
you make moldy melon-ade.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.901
All right, let's do it.
Let's throw a melon!

05:50.902 --> 05:54.003
That's the spirit!
There you go, large bro!

05:55.373 --> 05:56.707
TINA:
<i>Joe.</i>

05:56.708 --> 05:58.508
<i>Joe, Joe, Joe.</i>

05:58.509 --> 06:00.744
<i>I've never even thought
about Joe that way before,</i>

06:00.745 --> 06:03.347
<i>but maybe he's been thinking
about me that way all along.</i>

06:03.348 --> 06:05.681
<i>Maybe today, he looked
at himself in the mirror,</i>

06:05.717 --> 06:07.117
<i>and he said, "Today's the day</i>

06:07.118 --> 06:08.752
<i>that you tell Tina
how you feel."</i>

06:08.753 --> 06:10.621
<i>He's probably a mess right now.</i>

06:10.622 --> 06:12.856
<i>I've got to make eye contact
again. I... (groans)</i>

06:12.857 --> 06:14.558
<i>I can't see him from
this position though!</i>

06:14.559 --> 06:16.960
<i>All right,
time to turn my desk.</i>

06:16.961 --> 06:18.695
<i>Detention is two hours.</i>

06:18.696 --> 06:21.098
<i>If I move the desk
an inch every five minutes,</i>

06:21.099 --> 06:23.567
<i>I'll be able to see Joe's eyes
in about 90 minutes.</i>

06:23.568 --> 06:25.101
<i>Here goes.</i>
FROND: Tina.

06:25.136 --> 06:26.202
No moving your desk.

06:26.237 --> 06:27.437
TINA:
<i>Damn it!</i>

06:27.438 --> 06:29.338
<i>I'll find another way.
Wait for me, Joe.</i>

06:29.374 --> 06:30.941
Okay. I just
want to verify

06:30.942 --> 06:34.378
that this year your retirement
contribution was... zero.

06:34.379 --> 06:36.213
That sounds right.
(phone rings)

06:36.214 --> 06:37.714
Oh, I'm sorry,
I have to get that.

06:37.715 --> 06:39.149
I sent Pamela home
early today.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.584
(laughs) Just...

06:40.585 --> 06:41.918
Remember? (laughs)

06:41.919 --> 06:43.119
There's nobody there.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.086
I-I remember.

06:44.122 --> 06:45.555
Hello. This is Gerald.

06:45.556 --> 06:46.957
Oh, hey, Tim.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.059
Yeah, I've got
the cookies right here.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.727
Okay.

06:50.728 --> 06:54.430
Under no circumstances
should we eat these cookies?

06:54.465 --> 06:56.132
Oh, my God.
Oh, my... What?

06:56.167 --> 06:57.901
Right, but... (laughs)

06:57.902 --> 07:00.270
Let's just say
maybe we ate some.

07:00.271 --> 07:02.805
Mm. I-I had two.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.174
Uh, I-I only
had one.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.608
I had three, hello!

07:05.643 --> 07:07.944
Okay, well, uh,
thanks for telling us.

07:07.945 --> 07:09.445
Bye.
Gerald,

07:09.480 --> 07:10.880
what's happening?
What's going on?

07:10.915 --> 07:13.183
Uh, it turns out
the cookies I gave you

07:13.184 --> 07:15.751
have marijuana in them...
a lot of it.

07:15.787 --> 07:16.520
Oh, no.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.521
I-I guess

07:17.522 --> 07:19.089
Tim made two batches of cookies.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.357
These were for his mom.

07:20.358 --> 07:23.259
She apparently ate hers
and didn't get high, so...

07:23.294 --> 07:24.828
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no, no.

07:24.829 --> 07:26.963
We can't get stoned
in the middle of the day.

07:26.964 --> 07:28.497
We're old. We have kids!

07:28.533 --> 07:29.932
Oh, God. This is bad.

07:29.967 --> 07:32.502
Stupid cookies!
They were good though.

07:32.503 --> 07:34.603
Maybe I'll just have one more.
Lin, no.

07:34.639 --> 07:36.806
Gene, we are
about to make history.

07:36.841 --> 07:38.942
And here we...

07:38.943 --> 07:40.910
Uh-oh.
...go!

07:40.945 --> 07:42.311
(distorted):
No...!

07:42.346 --> 07:43.647
Aah!

07:43.648 --> 07:45.848
What the...?!
Ugh, dude.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.516
Oh, my God.
Is that Logan?

07:47.552 --> 07:49.553
(chuckles)

07:49.554 --> 07:50.986
Oh, wow.

07:51.022 --> 07:53.390
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.658
Louise Belcher.

07:55.693 --> 07:57.660
Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide.
Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide.

07:57.695 --> 08:01.198
(laughs)
Oh, you just made my day.

08:01.199 --> 08:03.900
I wanted to work out
some of this hostility

08:03.901 --> 08:05.534
I'm feeling all the time,

08:05.570 --> 08:08.205
which Dr. Swanson says
is totally normal,

08:08.206 --> 08:11.173
but I was like,
how am I gonna do that?

08:11.209 --> 08:12.409
Now I know.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.344
I'm gonna clear my schedule

08:14.345 --> 08:17.780
so that I can make your lives
a living hell!

08:17.815 --> 08:20.050
Uh, I think you forgot about
that thing you have today!

08:20.051 --> 08:22.455
Remember that thing?
You can't miss that thing!

08:24.473 --> 08:26.274
You are dead, Louise Belcher!

08:26.275 --> 08:28.308
(chuckles): Okay, look,
that was an accident.

08:28.344 --> 08:31.179
A hilarious accident
that I wish I had on video.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.981
You don't have to get all
crazy-face mad about it, okay?

08:34.015 --> 08:35.549
Logan, come on.
Let's hit the park.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.284
You guys go.
I'm gonna figure out

08:37.285 --> 08:39.419
how to ruin Louise's life
for a while.

08:39.455 --> 08:41.255
All right, dude.
We believe in you.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.657
Well, we're gonna go inside
and watch TV now.

08:43.692 --> 08:45.560
Fine. I'm just gonna
go around front,

08:45.561 --> 08:48.262
ring the doorbell and
tell your parents what you did.

08:48.297 --> 08:49.998
Well, joke's on you
because they aren't home.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.531
Yeah!

08:51.567 --> 08:54.302
Oh, your parents aren't home?
Interesting.

08:54.303 --> 08:56.436
That expands my options.

08:56.472 --> 08:59.007
Well, our boyfriend is
coming over any minute

08:59.008 --> 09:01.308
and he has a Bowflex!

09:03.979 --> 09:05.779
I don't...
I don't think I'm high.

09:05.814 --> 09:07.281
Me neither.

09:07.316 --> 09:08.782
I feel like I'm peeing.

09:08.817 --> 09:10.017
Am I peeing right now?

09:10.052 --> 09:11.486
Bob, can you check?

09:11.487 --> 09:13.921
So, are-are our taxes,
like, mostly done?

09:13.956 --> 09:16.957
Wow, look at all these numbers.

09:16.992 --> 09:17.958
Oh, boy.

09:17.993 --> 09:19.394
What are they, right?

09:19.395 --> 09:21.962
How do we assign value
to symbols?

09:21.997 --> 09:24.165
I swear I'm peeing.
Bob, can someone see?

09:24.166 --> 09:25.934
Will you please stop?
Stop peeing?

09:25.935 --> 09:27.669
No, stop saying
"I'm peeing."

09:27.670 --> 09:28.769
Am I pretty?

09:30.105 --> 09:32.572
TINA: <i> Okay, time to take
bold action.</i>

09:32.608 --> 09:33.573
May I go to the restroom?

09:33.609 --> 09:34.609
(sighs) Fine.

09:34.610 --> 09:36.143

Stalker Texas Ranger

10:12.214 --> 10:14.048
still out there?
It's been almost an hour.

10:14.049 --> 10:15.215
He's there.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.319
I wonder if maybe we should,
you know, apologize,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.854
so he won't be so mad
and he won't kill us?

10:20.889 --> 10:22.790
Gene, relax.
He's down there,

10:22.791 --> 10:24.926
and we're way up here
with the doors locked.

10:24.927 --> 10:27.027
Don't tell me you're
actually scared of him.

10:27.062 --> 10:28.997
No, I'm scared
of something else.

10:28.998 --> 10:31.799
It's just a coincidence that
I'm staring at a really mean

10:31.800 --> 10:35.002
high school kid who's down there
doing karate on a parked car!

10:36.405 --> 10:38.006
All right, all right,
I'll talk to him.

10:38.007 --> 10:39.806
Excuse me.
Oh, good.

10:39.842 --> 10:42.310

Oh, God.

10:44.580 --> 10:47.615
I'm never going home
and I am never taking a shower

10:47.616 --> 10:49.517
until I get my revenge.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.819
Oh, man, you're
gonna be sorry, Louise.

10:52.855 --> 10:55.256
I <i> am</i> sorry
that I'm still talking to you.

10:55.257 --> 10:56.790
Louise,
maybe don't...

10:56.825 --> 10:58.960
I was thinking
I'd just give you a noogie

10:58.961 --> 11:02.330
or maybe a swirly,
but I've changed my mind.

11:02.331 --> 11:06.833
Now I'm gonna give you
a Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold!

11:06.869 --> 11:08.336
(quietly): Oh, man,
did he just say

11:08.337 --> 11:10.104
the Reverse Norwegian
Stink Hold?

11:10.105 --> 11:13.041
You do not want the Reverse
Norwegian Stink Hold.

11:13.042 --> 11:14.842
What?
That's a real thing?

11:14.843 --> 11:17.145
It's the signature move of
the professional wrestler

11:17.146 --> 11:18.446
Norwegian Steven.

11:18.447 --> 11:19.980
Since when do you
watch wrestling?

11:20.015 --> 11:21.515
I have a life, Louise!

11:21.550 --> 11:23.317
Well, what's a whatever whatever
Stink Hold?

11:23.318 --> 11:24.751
It doesn't even sound scary.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.187
Well, it is.

11:26.188 --> 11:28.189
When Norwegian Steven's got
his opponent on the ropes,

11:28.190 --> 11:30.958
he pulls them into
a headlock like this... Ooh.

11:30.959 --> 11:33.061
...and then he pinches
them like this... Whoa.

11:33.062 --> 11:35.106
...until they have to
breathe in his B.O.!

11:35.130 --> 11:37.331
Well, I'm not gonna
worry about that.

11:37.332 --> 11:39.499
He's never getting up here.

11:39.535 --> 11:41.135
I'm gonna jump up there
and grab you!

11:41.136 --> 11:43.137
(grunting)
Put your hand out.

11:43.138 --> 11:44.471
No, thank you.

Oh, man.

12:13.569 --> 12:15.403

12:17.339 --> 12:19.740
Hey, Gerald, I can
French braid my own hair.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.442
You want to see?
No.

12:21.443 --> 12:23.411
Yeah, look, hi.
Please, no.

12:23.412 --> 12:24.846
What? They're your friend.

12:24.847 --> 12:26.114
No, y-you're scaring me.

12:26.115 --> 12:27.747
Look. Look at us.

12:27.783 --> 12:29.416
We're gonna go into a French braid.
(groaning)

12:29.451 --> 12:31.419
(phone rings)
Aah! Who's calling?

12:31.420 --> 12:33.187
If it's Mom or Dad,
just play it cool.

12:33.188 --> 12:34.922
Right. That's me. Super cool.

12:34.923 --> 12:36.557
Belcher residence.

12:36.558 --> 12:38.960
My father is pooping,
my mom's in the shower,

12:38.961 --> 12:40.128
and she looks great.

12:40.129 --> 12:43.297
Hello, son. Gene, son. Pal.

12:43.298 --> 12:44.565
Oh, hi. Hi, Dad.

12:44.566 --> 12:47.201
Hi, Gene. I'm Dad. It's Dad.

12:47.202 --> 12:49.971
(quietly): Gene, Gene.
Don't mention the melon.

12:49.972 --> 12:52.440
Everything's great here.
Nothing to mention.

12:52.441 --> 12:53.708
No melons were thrown.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.209
(Louise groans loudly)

12:55.210 --> 12:57.145
(whispers):
Bob, don't tell him we're high.

12:57.146 --> 12:58.746
Listen, we may be
a little high...

12:58.747 --> 13:00.248
I mean late, getting home.

13:00.249 --> 13:02.550
Uh, the taxes keep going.

13:02.551 --> 13:03.818
Good job.

13:03.819 --> 13:05.586
Okay, great!
Everything here is great.

13:05.587 --> 13:07.588
Thanks for leaving me in charge.
Everything's good. Bye.

13:07.589 --> 13:09.389
He totally knew
I was stoned.

13:09.424 --> 13:11.225
He totally knew
we threw a melon.

13:11.226 --> 13:12.959
Hey, Logan's gone.

13:12.995 --> 13:14.495
See? I told you he'd give up.

13:14.496 --> 13:16.230
We're good.
(phone rings)

13:16.231 --> 13:17.965
Ugh, it's probably Dad again.

13:17.966 --> 13:20.401
Let me handle this. Hello.

13:20.402 --> 13:22.403
LOGAN: Hey, Louise.
What do you want, Logan?

13:22.404 --> 13:25.273
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm in your house.

13:25.274 --> 13:27.074
Oh, yeah? I don't see you.

13:27.075 --> 13:29.242
And why would you call me
to tell me that?

13:29.278 --> 13:30.945
'Cause I wanted
to make it menacing,

13:30.946 --> 13:33.814
like in the movies,
with the spooky music.

13:33.815 --> 13:35.615
(singing spooky music)

13:35.651 --> 13:37.151
Well, that's not
menacing at all.

13:37.152 --> 13:38.753
It's relaxing, actually.

13:38.754 --> 13:40.588
Okay, but if I'm not
in your house,

13:40.589 --> 13:42.523
then who's in your kitchen?

13:42.524 --> 13:44.090
(thump)
(gasps)

13:44.126 --> 13:46.160
Holy crap! Gene, Logan got in
the house somehow.

13:46.161 --> 13:47.460
What?!

13:47.496 --> 13:49.866
Logan is in the house! Run!
Aah!

13:50.933 --> 13:52.732
Ha-ha!

13:52.768 --> 13:53.768
(both scream)

13:53.769 --> 13:55.602
But you were...
I heard you.

13:55.637 --> 13:57.505
Let's just say
you left the window open,

13:57.506 --> 13:59.207
and let's just say
that I'm really good

13:59.208 --> 14:01.108
at throwing shoes
through windows,

14:01.109 --> 14:03.945
and let's just say that I'm also
gonna need that shoe back.

14:03.946 --> 14:06.547
And now I'm gonna
take you to Pitts-burg.

14:06.548 --> 14:07.914
Get it?

14:07.950 --> 14:09.583
I get it. Pretty good.

14:09.618 --> 14:11.241
Thanks.

15:41.295 --> 15:42.962
Oh. You don't
like my jokes?

15:42.963 --> 15:45.164
What? No!

15:45.165 --> 15:46.466
I mean, yeah.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.867
I mean, kind of.

15:47.868 --> 15:49.502
I mean, no.
Linda.

15:49.503 --> 15:51.170
But you always
laugh at them.

15:51.171 --> 15:52.572
Everyone laughs at them.

15:52.573 --> 15:55.408
Because we like you.
Everyone likes you.

15:55.409 --> 15:57.477
And it's not at all because
you're their accountant

15:57.478 --> 15:59.846
and they're scared
of being audited. Not at all.

15:59.847 --> 16:02.415
(chuckles):
I... uh, I actually like them.

16:02.416 --> 16:03.816
I love them.

16:03.817 --> 16:05.818
No, you don't, Bob.
Don't lie.

16:05.819 --> 16:07.687
Oh, God. Oh, God.

16:07.688 --> 16:09.689
I always thought if
accounting didn't work out,

16:09.690 --> 16:11.289
I could quit
and do stand-up.

16:11.325 --> 16:13.326
You-you could do bad stand-up.

16:13.327 --> 16:14.960
That's really popular.

16:14.995 --> 16:16.696
This is the worst day
of my life.

16:16.697 --> 16:18.330
I don't even feel like
doing taxes.

16:18.365 --> 16:19.766
No, no, you-you
should do some.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.200
It'll make you
feel better.

16:21.201 --> 16:22.602
(doorbell buzzes)
Oh, my God!

16:22.603 --> 16:24.070
What is that?!
Did you guys hear that?!

16:24.071 --> 16:25.705
That's the doorbell.
Who's here?

16:25.706 --> 16:27.040
I'll go see. No! No!

16:27.041 --> 16:28.073
(doorbell buzzes)

16:28.108 --> 16:29.542
(quietly):
Oh, crap.

16:29.543 --> 16:31.344
That's my next client.

16:31.345 --> 16:33.513
He probably wants me
to do his taxes.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.747
We got to hide.

16:34.748 --> 16:36.049
Yes. Absolutely.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.084
Great plan.
(doorbell buzzes)

16:38.085 --> 16:40.686
We should build a fort
with the cushions.

16:40.687 --> 16:43.389
That way, even if he gets
in, he won't see us.

16:43.390 --> 16:45.291
Okay, but I'm still sad,

16:45.292 --> 16:47.393
so I want my own room
in the fort

16:47.394 --> 16:50.229
to reflect and figure out
where to go from here.

16:50.230 --> 16:52.130
You absolutely deserve that.

16:53.367 --> 16:54.900
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:54.935 --> 16:56.969
Where are you guys going?
We're about to rehearse.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.405
GENE: Uh, there's a shrimp
emergency in the ocean.

16:59.406 --> 17:02.941
Wait a minute. Aren't you two
a little shrimpy to be shrimps?

17:02.976 --> 17:04.675
LOUISE: Don't you
shrimp-shame me!

17:04.711 --> 17:06.079
Okay, you guys need

17:06.079 --> 17:07.780
to take those costumes off
immediately.

17:07.781 --> 17:09.448
Louise!
(both yelling)

17:09.483 --> 17:10.781
Run, Gene, run!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:10.818 --> 17:12.384
Don't get the tails dirty!

17:13.820 --> 17:17.056
(both panting)

17:17.057 --> 17:19.258
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.

17:19.259 --> 17:20.325
(gasps)

17:26.133 --> 17:28.134
Great choice
of hiding place, guys.

17:28.135 --> 17:30.235
There's no way out.

17:30.270 --> 17:33.422
Oh, God! I think I
just bisqued my pants!

17:34.613 --> 17:37.340
Well, well, well,
looks like your nose

17:37.341 --> 17:40.309
just RSVP'd yes to my armpit.

17:40.344 --> 17:42.478
No. No way,
Logan. Just...

17:42.513 --> 17:43.713
Just-just let us go!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.181
Oh, I will.

17:45.182 --> 17:48.083
After I've destroyed
your sinuses forever.

17:48.119 --> 17:50.719
Oh, no, no, I...
I, um... Aah!

17:50.755 --> 17:53.656
Just stop trying
to get away, Louise.

17:53.691 --> 17:56.226
Let me give you the Reverse
Norwegian Stink Hold.

17:56.227 --> 17:57.894
It only takes a minute,

17:57.895 --> 18:00.730
but you'll remember it
for the rest of your life!

18:00.731 --> 18:02.399
No. Come on, no.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.301
Are you... are you crying?

18:04.302 --> 18:05.769
No! (sniffles)

18:05.770 --> 18:07.871
(groans) Wait!

18:07.872 --> 18:10.373
If you're gonna give anyone the
Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold,

18:10.374 --> 18:11.740
it's gonna be me.

18:11.776 --> 18:13.342
What was that, little fella?

18:13.377 --> 18:15.145
Oh, my God!
I think I just said,

18:15.146 --> 18:17.480
if you are gonna give anyone the
Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold,

18:17.481 --> 18:18.915
it's gonna be me!

18:18.916 --> 18:21.451
Get out of my way.

18:21.452 --> 18:25.387
No! I am very scared right now,
but I'm not moving!

18:25.423 --> 18:26.355
Gene, don't.

18:26.390 --> 18:27.856
Okay, you asked for it.

18:27.892 --> 18:29.592
(grunting)

18:29.627 --> 18:32.062
Whiff it up, little man!
Whiff it up!

18:32.063 --> 18:35.531
(Gene groaning)
LOGAN: Oh. Yeah. Oh.

18:35.566 --> 18:37.434
(sighs)

18:37.435 --> 18:38.735
Hey, Linda.
What?

18:38.736 --> 18:40.470
I think I'm okay
to go home now.

18:40.471 --> 18:43.406
Plus, I mean, at some point,
we just have to go home.

18:43.407 --> 18:45.675
But we can't just
leave Gerald like this.

18:45.676 --> 18:47.243
You got to talk to him.

18:47.244 --> 18:48.612
(sighs) Okay.

18:48.613 --> 18:50.580
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Bob.

18:50.581 --> 18:52.616
Look, I'm... I-I make burgers,

18:52.617 --> 18:54.584
but I also do
this little chalkboard

18:54.585 --> 18:57.754
with the burgers of the day,
and I think they are...

18:57.755 --> 18:59.356
hilarious,
but they probably aren't.

18:59.357 --> 19:01.358
They're okay.

19:01.359 --> 19:03.693
They're bad, but that's okay,
because they make me laugh.

19:03.694 --> 19:06.963
I do it for me, and you're
a really good accountant, right?

19:06.964 --> 19:07.964
I hope.

19:07.965 --> 19:09.299
I'm pretty good.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.267
So just keep on doing that.

19:11.268 --> 19:13.036
Keep on accountin'.

19:13.037 --> 19:16.373
But also, make your jokes,
because you like them, okay?

19:16.374 --> 19:18.274
But work on 'em. More.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.043
Okay. Wait!

19:20.044 --> 19:21.678
You guys can't leave.
What's gonna happen to me?

19:21.679 --> 19:23.113
You're gonna be fine,
Gerald.

19:23.114 --> 19:24.446
You still have the fort.

19:24.482 --> 19:26.016
Listen, this is
very important.

19:26.017 --> 19:28.018
Later tonight, when
you aren't high anymore,

19:28.019 --> 19:30.686
we need you to finish
and mail our taxes.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.789
Can you describe them
to me, Bob?

19:32.790 --> 19:34.224
Oh, my God.
I'm just kidding.

19:34.225 --> 19:36.126
(laughs)
Hey, she laughed.

19:36.127 --> 19:38.294
She did!
Play us out with the tax-ophone?

19:38.295 --> 19:40.295
(imitating saxophone music)

19:44.502 --> 19:46.503
TINA:
<i>Ugh, it's so awkward.</i>

19:46.504 --> 19:48.805
<i>Knowing he's back there,
expecting me to look at him</i>

19:48.806 --> 19:50.473
<i>the way
I've always looked at him.</i>

19:50.474 --> 19:52.208
<i>It's not fair to him
or to me.</i>

19:52.209 --> 19:54.044
<i>I've got to show him
my breakup eyes.</i>

19:54.045 --> 19:55.512
<i>Like this.</i>

19:55.513 --> 19:57.080
<i>Whoa, whoa, easy, Tina girl.</i>

19:57.081 --> 19:59.315
<i>That was way too harsh.
No need to be mean.</i>

19:59.316 --> 20:01.718
<i>I need to use
my let-him-down-easy eyes.</i>

20:01.719 --> 20:02.819
<i>Like this.</i>

20:02.820 --> 20:04.387
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

20:04.388 --> 20:06.588
<i>Okay, here it goes.</i>

20:11.996 --> 20:14.230
<i>He took that pretty well.</i>

20:14.231 --> 20:16.533
<i>He's hurting, but he doesn't
want to let it show.</i>

20:16.534 --> 20:17.934
<i>That's Joe. (chuckles)</i>

20:17.935 --> 20:19.401
<i>I'll never forget him.</i>

20:19.437 --> 20:22.172
How was it, Gene?
Was it bad?

20:22.173 --> 20:23.907
It was painful.
Yeah?

20:23.908 --> 20:25.674
And smelly.
Yeah.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.110
But I've been through things

20:27.111 --> 20:28.912
that were more painful
and more smelly.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.714
Just not since my own birth.

20:30.715 --> 20:32.382
Mmm!
Aah!

20:32.383 --> 20:34.384
What's happening?!
Thanks for doing that.

20:34.385 --> 20:35.752
You're a great large brother.

20:35.753 --> 20:37.553
Anytime, shrimp.

20:39.757 --> 20:41.858
Yeah, that was
definitely our kids.

20:41.859 --> 20:43.525
Why are they
dressed as shrimps?

20:43.561 --> 20:45.628
And why are they hugging?
Do they do that?

20:45.629 --> 20:47.263
I didn't know
they did that.

20:47.264 --> 20:49.765
Ooh, hey, look at that.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
Wow.
Right?
