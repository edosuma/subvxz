00:01.000 --> 00:04.767
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- [audience] Tool Time!</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:09.400
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:17.083 --> 00:19.313
<i>Thank you very much.
Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

00:19.386 --> 00:21.877
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

00:21.955 --> 00:26.255
Of course you all know my assistant,
Al ''Here Comes the Groom'' Borland!

00:26.326 --> 00:29.261
[applause]

00:29.863 --> 00:31.421
Big day tomorrow, right, Al?

00:31.531 --> 00:34.694
Uh, yes. Tomorrow is the big day.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.226
Uh, in 23 hours and 39 minutes,

00:38.304 --> 00:41.398
Dr. llene Louise Markham will become

00:41.474 --> 00:45.103
Dr. llene Louise Markham-Borland.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.475
[audience laughs]

00:47.514 --> 00:50.039
lt rolls right off the tongue,
doesn't it?

00:50.650 --> 00:53.141
Anyway, on today's show

00:53.219 --> 00:56.916
we're gonna be talking about
replacing your old bathroom fixtures

00:56.990 --> 00:58.150
with new ones.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.021
You might want to select these

01:00.093 --> 01:02.618
and install them
when the wife's out of the house.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.788
Otherwise, you might end up with...

01:04.864 --> 01:07.526
- [crows] ...one of these.
- [audience laughs]

01:08.234 --> 01:11.499
[continues crowing]

01:12.505 --> 01:15.406
[kissing sound]

01:18.244 --> 01:22.408
Who wants tap water coming out
of a Klingon bird of prey, huh?

01:24.217 --> 01:26.378
Women, that's who.

01:26.486 --> 01:30.388
Women tend to overdo everything.
Bathrooms, weddings...

01:30.457 --> 01:34.223
Now, how can you compare
bathrooms and weddings?

01:34.327 --> 01:38.593
Well, during my wedding, l spent most of
the time in the bathroom.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.099
[audience and Tim laugh]

01:41.167 --> 01:44.193
See, a man wouldn't plan
one of these big shindigs.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.296
A man's wedding would be simple
and direct. Right, guys?

01:49.509 --> 01:53.570
Wouldn't cost an arm and a leg, either.
l could do a wedding for, l don't know,

01:53.646 --> 01:56.809
[blows raspberry]
...off the top of my head, $1 37.50.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.384
$1 32.00 without flowers.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.025
There is no way you can do
a wedding for that kind of money.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.354
Watch me!

02:07.427 --> 02:10.919
The first thing to go, are those
expensive invitations women have.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.761
A man's invitation would cost
about... mmm, 20 cents.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.428
- [scoffs] What are you taking about?
- l'll show you.

02:17.537 --> 02:20.267
Hank! Yeah. l'm getting hitched.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.171
What are you doing Tuesday?

02:23.209 --> 02:27.339
Tuesday? That's ridiculous. Nobody would
go to a wedding on a Tuesday.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.847
Ah-ha! Added bonus then.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.942
Eliminates 80Ã¸% of your rogue relatives.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.182
Stop talking about marriage
and get back to faucets.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.555
To wedding cakes. Let's start talking
about wedding cakes.

02:39.626 --> 02:43.255
Women want tiered wedding cakes,
look like Aztec sacrificial altars.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.490
And on the top...

02:45.565 --> 02:47.863
...the bride and
groom in the penthouse.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.061
Holding hands and smiling.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.900
[snorts] What's that about?

02:53.573 --> 02:56.542
lt symbolizes the joy of marriage.

02:56.643 --> 03:00.170
A man's wedding cake would show
what marriage is really like.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.612
Heidi, the man's wedding cake, please.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.080
[audience laughs]

03:06.686 --> 03:08.449
[bell dings]

03:10.323 --> 03:13.087
- [audience cheers]
- [bell dings again]

04:03.243 --> 04:07.475
- [grunts]
- Whoa! Big gift?

04:07.547 --> 04:09.674
You and Mom have a big fight?

04:12.051 --> 04:14.986
- lt's for Al.
- You and Al have a big fight?

04:16.122 --> 04:18.682
[grunts] lt's for his
bachelor party tonight.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.921
- Cool! Can we come?
- Yeah, we're bachelors.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.122
And we know how to party.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.033
This isn't a party for kids.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.503
Ooh, what are you gonna do?
Sit around and tell dirty jokes?

04:33.573 --> 04:35.939
Waste of time.
Al wouldn't get any of them.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.042
- Hi, guys.
- [all] Hi.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.081
Wait, wait, take these upstairs.

04:42.148 --> 04:45.640
<i>Tim, how could you say
all those idiotic things on Tool Time?</i>

04:45.718 --> 04:49.085
You'll have to be more specific.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.522
How can you stereotype women like that?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.991
Again, you'll have to be more specific.

04:56.095 --> 04:59.258
The swan faucets,
how women overdo everything.

04:59.332 --> 05:02.699
You put down marriage, weddings.
You probably scared Al to death.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.238
- Honey, he knows l was kidding.
- Well, he's about to get married.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.402
You could've said something
supportive, nice, emotional.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.944
l'm saving that for the bachelor party.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.503
[groans]

05:17.950 --> 05:18.917
[Tim laughs]

05:19.018 --> 05:23.318
Yeah, l heard about all the warmth
and sensitivity at your bachelor party.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.619
lt was a very special evening for me.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.820
And luckily, that stripper
turned out to be a paramedic.

05:32.632 --> 05:36.693
[laughs] And then she says, ''Fifty
bucks, Senator. Same as in town.''

05:39.906 --> 05:43.034
l don't get it.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.872
Do you get it, Cal?

05:47.213 --> 05:50.876
lt's amazing. The flannel brothers
haven't gotten one joke yet.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.481
Well, we were brought up
in a very proper home.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.818
Mother did shield us from a lot.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.517
Your mother could
shield Michigan from the sun.

06:05.431 --> 06:10.391
You know, l myself had rather a
Puritanical upbringing.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.497
My father was abstemious
and he abhorred the salacious bon mot.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.236
l know he's speaking English because
l understood the word ''father.''

06:20.947 --> 06:24.883
Hey, slow down, big fella. That's the
third diet ginger ale you've had.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.386
This is a first. The groom's gonna
end up the designated driver.

06:32.258 --> 06:35.819
Come on, Al! This is your last night
as a free man. Have a real drink.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.563
You know, you're right.

06:38.631 --> 06:42.089
lt's time to throw caution to the wind
and sow my wild oats!

06:42.168 --> 06:43.658
- Yeah.
- [Tim] Yeah, right.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.398
Or, in your case, wild oat bran.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.873
Milton, no more diet ginger ale.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.444
Give me a, uh, Jack Black, beer back.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.980
[guys cheer]

06:57.550 --> 07:00.519
You know, l want you guys to know
it really means a lot to me

07:00.586 --> 07:03.953
to spend this night
with my dearest friends.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.752
When are they coming?

07:08.795 --> 07:13.095
Boy, Al! l never thought l'd see the day
when you took the fatal plunge.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.464
Aw, come on!
l wouldn't call it a plunge.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.366
Marty, what would you call it?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.600
More like a slow agonizing death.

07:24.710 --> 07:28.271
Come on! Doesn't somebody have
something good to say about marriage?

07:32.518 --> 07:34.349
Be good if mine ended.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.919
You know, Martin Luther
had something good to say.

07:39.992 --> 07:43.519
''There is no more lovely, friendly
or charming relationship,

07:43.596 --> 07:46.622
communion, or company
than a good marriage.''

07:46.933 --> 07:48.230
[guys] Here, here!

07:48.301 --> 07:50.997
You know, Al, we make
a lot of jokes about marriage.

07:51.070 --> 07:55.439
And the truth is when you find the right
person, there's nothing quite like it.

07:55.508 --> 07:58.068
<i>Here.. here's to
my best friend, Al Borland.</i>

07:58.144 --> 07:59.577
[guys cheer]

07:59.645 --> 08:01.613
Let's not forget the bride-to-be,

08:01.681 --> 08:05.310
Dr. llene Louise Markham...
''hyphen-hyphen!''

08:05.384 --> 08:07.284
[all] ''Hyphen-hyphen.''

08:08.087 --> 08:10.749
''Hyphen,'' ls that a Ukrainian name?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.554
- Al, we got a little surprise for you.
- [Tim] Yeah.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.791
Oh, boy! Here it comes!

08:20.933 --> 08:26.303
Al, we brought some tokens of our esteem
to commemorate the eve of your nuptials.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.205
Oh, you guys!

08:29.275 --> 08:32.403
Open mine first. You've been
waiting for this for a long time.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.174
An oven-ready casserole set?

08:35.815 --> 08:38.578
Loosen your girdle, will ya, fella?

08:38.683 --> 08:43.553
This isn't a bridal shower with women
oohing and ahhing over girlie gifts.

08:46.492 --> 08:49.620
Ooh, a demolition hammer!

08:49.695 --> 08:51.959
Ooh! Ahh!

08:52.064 --> 08:55.966
- [grunts]
- With a three-quarter-inch X-shank.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.092
[guys] Ahh!

08:58.170 --> 09:00.434
The kind of thing
you never buy for yourself.

09:00.506 --> 09:03.031
That is so stunning.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.203
- And in such good taste.
- lt's so slimming.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.510
This is exactly why
l registered at Sears!

09:11.817 --> 09:14.149
l just...l just love it!

09:14.220 --> 09:16.085
All right, buddy.

09:16.489 --> 09:19.219
So, Lady Astor said
to Winston Churchill,

09:19.292 --> 09:22.728
''lf you were my husband,
l'd put poison in your coffee.''

09:22.795 --> 09:26.856
To which he replied, ''Madam, if l were
your husband, l would drink it!''

09:29.669 --> 09:32.570
Churchill, huh?
Does he ever play Vegas?

09:35.474 --> 09:39.001
- Great party, huh?
- The best.

09:39.078 --> 09:44.448
Tim, you know before when you were
saying about finding the right woman?

09:44.550 --> 09:47.212
Yeah. What about it?

09:47.286 --> 09:49.754
[chuckles] How does a guy know
if he's found her?

09:49.822 --> 09:53.189
Usually he knows before
he's gotten in as deep as you have.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.623
Yeah.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.461
[chuckles]

10:00.566 --> 10:02.124
You do know, don't you?

10:02.201 --> 10:04.066
- Of course.
- Yeah.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.299
- l... l think so.
- Yep, yep.

10:07.406 --> 10:08.964
l thought so.

10:09.075 --> 10:13.011
l... l really don't know if l should
go through with this wedding.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.546
What? No!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.980
[repeating] Al...

10:17.049 --> 10:19.813
...don't listen to this.
ls it because of what we said?

10:19.885 --> 10:23.514
No. l don't...
l don't take any of that seriously.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.324
<i>ls it because of
what l said on Tool Time?</i>

10:27.393 --> 10:30.157
l never take that seriously.

10:30.896 --> 10:34.662
Well, what are you talking about?
What's the problem here?

10:34.767 --> 10:37.793
l don't know if llene
is the right woman for me.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.167
- She is!
- No.

10:39.238 --> 10:42.765
lf l go through with this, it could be
the biggest mistake of my life.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.776
[sighs]

10:44.844 --> 10:48.007
This is... this is...
this is not like you, Al, um...

10:48.114 --> 10:52.073
...you shouldn't be drinking that.
lt's just that brown liquor talking.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.515
How many have you had?

10:53.586 --> 10:56.020
- lf l finish this...
- lf you finish that one.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.318
One.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.757
What are you guys still doing up?

11:08.834 --> 11:12.497
We're getting this stuff together
to detail Al's car for the wedding.

11:12.571 --> 11:16.701
You're gonna tie cans to the bumper and
spray shaving cream on the windshield?

11:16.776 --> 11:19.643
- That's supposed to be funny?
- Dad thinks so.

11:22.515 --> 11:27.009
Why don't you try doing this to his car
and see how funny he thinks it is?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.879
l like the way you think.

11:32.925 --> 11:36.759
Oh! Stay away from my shoes!

11:39.965 --> 11:41.523
Al...

11:42.768 --> 11:45.737
- ...what are you doing here?
- Tim made me come.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.405
He doesn't want to
go through with the wedding.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.272
[gasps] Oh, my God!

11:52.344 --> 11:55.211
This is all your fault!

11:56.615 --> 11:58.776
<i>You didn't do enough damage
on Tool Time?</i>

11:58.884 --> 12:02.650
You had to drive him over the edge
at the bachelor party?

12:02.755 --> 12:06.816
- l told you she'd blame this on me.
- No. lt's not Tim's fault.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.225
- lt's not?
- l've thought about it for months.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.457
l thought it would just go away.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.967
[sighs] Tonight at the party,
l looked at the clock

12:16.035 --> 12:20.995
and l realized that in 1 1 hours and 1 3
minutes l was going to be a married man.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.565
And l... l don't think l want to be.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.804
Oh, Al.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.246
lt's just cold feet.
That happens to everybody.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.409
- lt does?
- [Tim] Yeah, everybody. Sure.

12:32.485 --> 12:36.854
Yeah, absolutely. The morning of
my wedding l was such a wreck.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.652
My sisters had to literally drag me

12:39.725 --> 12:43.957
kicking and screaming
the whole way to the church.

12:44.029 --> 12:48.261
l was freaked out at the prospect of
spending the rest of my life with Tim.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.338
- Yeah.
- [sarcastic] Yeah.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.474
l don't remember you telling me this.

12:56.542 --> 13:00.171
Well, l didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

13:00.246 --> 13:03.010
So, you thought now
would be a good time?

13:03.082 --> 13:05.846
l'm trying to help Al out here. OK?

13:05.918 --> 13:08.944
- You are perfect together...
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.319
Kicking and screaming?

13:12.591 --> 13:15.492
Tim, l was young. l had
my whole future ahead of me.

13:15.561 --> 13:19.998
- You didn't have second thoughts?
- No. But l'm... l'm having some now.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.129
Maybe l should go.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.863
- No, don't...
- l'll go with you.

13:24.937 --> 13:29.237
You are being ridiculous.
This was what, 1 8 years ago? Al! Al!

13:29.308 --> 13:32.072
You said llene was the
best thing that happened to you.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.078
l know! l know that!

13:34.146 --> 13:37.707
Lately there's been some things
about her that just get on my nerves.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.581
- Well, like what? What?
- Well...

13:40.686 --> 13:44.178
...she's so darn... nice!

13:44.256 --> 13:47.157
She never stands up for herself!
She never gets angry!

13:47.226 --> 13:51.128
- Never gets annoyed!
- Kicking and screaming?

13:51.430 --> 13:54.365
l want somebody who is feisty!

13:54.433 --> 13:57.266
Somebody who is not afraid
to look me in the eye and say,

13:57.336 --> 14:00.464
''Al, you've had
way too much bacon bits!''

14:01.774 --> 14:05.904
l want somebody...
somebody like Barbara Walters.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.680
Barbara Walters?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.754
Oh, yeah. She's sassy.

14:17.156 --> 14:20.319
Al, the wedding is tomorrow.

14:20.426 --> 14:24.522
Honey, you've gotta go home and
give this some serious thought.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.931
This is a decision that'll affect
the rest of your life.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.492
- And llene's.
- l know. l... you're right.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.902
l just, l have to go home
and decide whether...

14:33.973 --> 14:36.840
whether there is something
really deep between us,

14:36.909 --> 14:40.174
or if it's just wild,
unbridled sex!

14:42.448 --> 14:44.939
[both groaning]

14:50.456 --> 14:52.617
What's going on?
ls the wedding on or off?

14:52.725 --> 14:56.422
- Al called at 7:30 and it was off.
- Then he called at 8:00 and it was on.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.702
OK, so, what do you think?

15:12.778 --> 15:15.076
- The Civil War's over.
- Oh!

15:26.025 --> 15:28.926
But apparently disco
is alive and kicking.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.633
Al, welcome. Welcome.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.760
- [all] Al!
- [Jill] Oh, thank God you're here!

15:37.836 --> 15:39.064
l'm sorry l'm late.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.471
Remember that wedding rule.
Once in the building, don't leave.

15:42.541 --> 15:46.102
Don't worry. l'm feeling better about
things. l've made my decision.

15:46.178 --> 15:50.342
l'm gonna take the plunge.
ln 1 1 minutes and 1 4 seconds,

15:50.416 --> 15:53.510
Al Borland becomes Mr. Al Borland!

15:56.355 --> 15:59.518
OK. OK, OK, l need the groom.
l need the best man.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.061
l need ushers, ushers, ushers.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.495
- Are you an usher?
- Do you think l would buy this suit?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.369
- Good news. Al's here.
- Oh, good.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.839
Great, great. Well, l guess that means
that l'll be getting married soon.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.432
- [Jill] Yes!
- Heidi, l need you for pictures.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.602
[Heidi] OK.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.844
Oh, llene, look at you.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.578
You're so beautiful.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.951
This is gonna be the most
wonderful day of your life.

16:32.358 --> 16:35.486
l hope so because
l really have the jitters.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.290
- That's just cold feet.
- Really?

16:37.363 --> 16:41.265
Everybody feels that. You should've
seen me on the morning of my wedding.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.699
My sisters literally had
to drag me kicking...

16:43.802 --> 16:45.963
Kicking and screaming.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.574
Um, Patty would like
llene outside to take pictures.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.669
- l'll just be a second.
- Kicking and screaming.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.474
lt's normal. All brides are nervous.

16:58.550 --> 17:02.919
ls it normal to wonder if l'm making
the biggest mistake of my life?

17:02.988 --> 17:04.046
What?

17:05.424 --> 17:07.186
Jill...

17:07.259 --> 17:09.819
...l am not sure...

17:09.895 --> 17:12.227
...l'm doing the right thing.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.493
What?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.099
l love Al.

17:17.169 --> 17:22.607
But l don't know if l love
him the way l'm supposed to, you know?

17:23.308 --> 17:26.071
- He's a great guy.
- [snorting]

17:28.847 --> 17:31.680
But l'm not sure
if he's the guy for me.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.242
[sighs] Did this just
occur to you today?

17:35.320 --> 17:38.847
No. l... l guess l've been thinking
about it for a couple of months.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.654
l guess l just didn't want
to admit it to myself.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.490
Oh, llene.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.862
You know, the things l used to find
charming about him, l now find annoying.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.094
But that's marriage.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.938
You know that snorting sound he makes?
[imitates Al]

17:54.440 --> 17:58.342
Oh, but it's cute. And he only does it
after he tells a joke.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.641
He does it after
a few other things, too.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.806
[gasps] Oh!

18:09.655 --> 18:11.316
l need the bride on the double.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.917
No! llene, if you feel this way,
don't you think you should talk to Al?

18:14.993 --> 18:19.760
- l can't. He'd be devastated.
- Maybe. Maybe not. You never know.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.170
- Tim! Tim!
- What's the matter? What's the matter?

18:25.270 --> 18:28.899
You aren't gonna believe this.
llene feels the same way that Al does.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.534
She's got a thing for Barbara Walters?

18:34.780 --> 18:38.147
She thinks that she's making
the biggest mistake of her life.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.277
[Patty] OK, good. l need
a few more of Al and llene.

18:41.386 --> 18:44.753
- Uh, they need the groom at the altar.
- [llene] Al! Al!

18:44.823 --> 18:47.587
- We need to talk!
- l'm needed at the altar.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.820
lt's now or never, Al.

18:50.028 --> 18:53.896
l'm not sure if we
should be getting married.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.524
- Woo-hoo!
- [camera clicks]

18:59.738 --> 19:02.002
You? You what?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.372
Really?

19:04.443 --> 19:06.741
- l'm not sure either.
- Over here.

19:09.481 --> 19:14.009
You're not sure?
Well... why didn't you say something?

19:15.888 --> 19:18.152
l... l made a commitment to you.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.054
Woo-ooh.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.589
- Why didn't you say something?
- Over here.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.224
- Why don't we finish this in private?
- Could you excuse us a second?

19:37.409 --> 19:39.900
- How's it going?
- Any news from the lovebirds?

19:40.045 --> 19:42.878
- Not yet.
- How's it going in the church?

19:42.948 --> 19:44.438
Uh, pretty good.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.952
Heidi got her hoop skirt caught
in the communion rail.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.887
All the guys are lining up
to help her get untangled.

19:52.724 --> 19:56.160
And even worse.
Al's mother's starting to pace.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.163
l thought l felt the
foundation shaking.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.901
l had better get back, uh...

20:02.968 --> 20:05.436
...Harry's holding my place in line.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.938
- [sighs]
- [door opens]

20:08.006 --> 20:12.102
Are the doors opening?
Oh, this looks good. They're smiling.

20:12.177 --> 20:15.146
Oh, Al. l'm so glad we talked.

20:15.247 --> 20:18.182
Me, too. l'm sure glad
we worked this out.

20:20.352 --> 20:23.082
Oh, look at them.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.316
A happy ending.
You're getting married.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.458
- No, we're not.
- You're not.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.788
Well, we thought we'd
be better off just friends.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.730
- Good friends.
- Yes.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.326
Does this mean
she's available now?

20:43.442 --> 20:46.104
Hey, guys. Are you sure
this is what you want to do?

20:46.178 --> 20:49.739
- l really think it's the best thing.
- What about you, Al?

20:49.848 --> 20:52.544
Oh, yeah. l...l feel the same way.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.577
l... l just don't know how
l'm gonna break it to mother.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.590
- [Mrs. Borland] Oh, no! Ho-ho!
- [thudding]

21:03.395 --> 21:05.556
l think she knows.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.291
l think somebody had
better send for a forklift.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.327
Mother!

21:15.841 --> 21:18.810
Strangest wedding l've ever been to.

21:18.877 --> 21:22.369
Great music, great food.
Nobody got married.

21:26.084 --> 21:29.645
lf you'd had it your way, that's how
our wedding would've ended up.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.823
Are you still obsessing about that?

21:32.891 --> 21:34.552
Sorry.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.995
lt's a little upsetting to find out
after 1 8 years, our marriage is a sham.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.936
[laughs] You're not seriously upset?

21:47.005 --> 21:48.563
Maybe.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.176
OK...

21:52.244 --> 21:54.542
...what is it
you really want out of this?

21:56.748 --> 21:58.375
What do you got?

22:10.796 --> 22:13.162
l love you very, very much.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.900
Marrying you was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.237
What else you got?
