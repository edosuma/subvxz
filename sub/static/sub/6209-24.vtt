I'll have to get back to you on that.

11:00.436 --> 11:04.101
My ex-wife is behind this.
I just know it.

11:07.483 --> 11:08.516
Why am I here?

11:08.693 --> 11:11.777
Oh, parking ticket? Beheading?
I didn't ask.

11:11.945 --> 11:15.778
This custody hearing regarding
Sabrina Spellman will come to order.

11:15.949 --> 11:17.195
But I'm already in custody.

11:17.367 --> 11:20.368
My parents turned my witch training
over to my aunts and I live with them.

11:20.536 --> 11:22.115
But your aunts are kaput.

11:22.288 --> 11:25.872
The Witches' Council insists
you reside in only one household.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.159
- Why?
- Check Article 12, Section 15.

11:29.461 --> 11:31.585
Because you say so?

11:31.755 --> 11:34.673
Now, you have to choose
which aunt you wish to live with.

11:35.424 --> 11:38.212
This choice will affect
the rest of your life,

11:38.385 --> 11:39.418
so choose wisely.

11:40.679 --> 11:41.759
Okay, who's it gonna be?

11:43.140 --> 11:44.385
You want me to decide now?

11:44.557 --> 11:47.678
You've lived with them for over a year.
You must have a favourite by now.

11:47.852 --> 11:50.059
So spill it. I got a squash game.

11:50.229 --> 11:51.890
I don't have a favourite. I love both.

11:52.065 --> 11:53.938
This is a court of law.

11:54.107 --> 11:55.935
This is not a greeting-card company.

11:57.069 --> 11:59.062
We'll reconvene later
for your decision.

12:03.115 --> 12:04.148
Ready?

12:04.325 --> 12:07.861
- You're going down this time, man.
- Come on. Come on. Come on, then.

12:08.037 --> 12:09.531
Oh, that's it? No help?

12:09.704 --> 12:11.579
I hope you both get...

JUDGE:
So, Sabrina,

13:21.727 --> 13:24.479
I trust you've made up your mind
which aunt to live with?

13:24.646 --> 13:27.683
I can't decide. I guess we'll just
have to forget the whole thing.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.685
We should grant you
a "What if?" spell.

13:29.859 --> 13:31.140
What's a "What if?"

13:31.319 --> 13:35.862
It allows you to look into the future
and see what might happen if, say,

13:36.031 --> 13:37.407
you never brushed your teeth.

13:37.574 --> 13:39.318
Or if dogs took shorthand.

13:39.492 --> 13:43.159
I see, like, what if Kenan and Kel
won the lottery?

13:45.998 --> 13:47.908
Where did you put the ticket?

13:49.209 --> 13:51.369
- What? What are you doing?
- I got hungry.

13:52.253 --> 13:53.962
Keep looking.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.206
Oh, oh!

13:57.383 --> 14:01.844
Oh, yes. Hey, Kel.
Kel, man, I found the ticket, Kel.

Okay, let me try a "what if?"

14:14.023 --> 14:15.898
- Uh, what if--?
- Excuse me.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.892
This is the remote.
We've gone digital.

14:21.821 --> 14:22.902
Okay, let me try again.

Grab some wheels.
Let's go mountain biking up the stairs.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.163
No, thanks. I just wondered
what happened to you.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.295
Oh, right.
We were supposed to get married.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.706
- I figured you forgot.
- No, no, no.

14:43.882 --> 14:47.418
You gave me a licence to sign.
It's around here somewhere.

14:50.847 --> 14:53.136
Oh, here it is. Sorry about the gum.

14:53.307 --> 14:55.016
- It's not too late, is it?
- Yeah.

14:55.184 --> 14:56.727
I gave you that three years ago.

14:56.894 --> 14:59.303
Man, I'm so disorganized.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.769
Well, you're here now.
Let me grab my coat.

15:01.940 --> 15:05.476
Sabrina, I've moved on.
I married someone else.

15:05.652 --> 15:07.811
- And you didn't call?
- I did.

15:07.988 --> 15:11.024
You told me you'd call me back after
you finished your game of "Tetris."

15:11.198 --> 15:12.444
How's that going, by the way?

15:13.409 --> 15:16.161

Now, you be honest to me, now.

16:23.304 --> 16:25.298
I'm in the placebo group, aren't I?

Not necessarily.
You could be part of Group C.

- Because I think it's keeping me alive.
