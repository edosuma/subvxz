00:02.108 --> 00:04.299
Drake is unbelievable.

00:04.596 --> 00:07.876
He's one of those guys who just gets away
with anything, you know.

00:08.581 --> 00:10.124
Time for a snack.

00:11.053 --> 00:15.347
He does whatever he wants and,
like never gets in touble.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.398
Cake is good.

00:18.372 --> 00:21.560
It's like he leads a charmed life.
Must be nice.

00:21.812 --> 00:25.567
Me, I always try to do the right thing.
- Milk.

00:26.328 --> 00:30.729
I follow all the rules. 'Cause if I even think
about doing something wrong..

00:30.842 --> 00:33.402
I get busted.
I don't get it.

00:36.129 --> 00:38.560
I wish I knew Drake's secret.

00:42.508 --> 00:45.610
Just once, I'd like to get away with something..

00:45.822 --> 00:47.809
Josh, get your feet off the coffee table!

00:49.014 --> 00:51.354
Every time!

00:59.996 --> 01:03.405
Where's Scottie's brother with the dune buggy?
- Calm down. He'll be here any minute.

01:03.410 --> 01:06.593
I can't wait! I've never
had a dune buggy before!

01:06.609 --> 01:08.705
We're gonna buggy it up!

01:12.208 --> 01:14.245
Hello. Trevor, where are you?
- Who is it?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.005
Scottie's brother.
- Where is he?

01:16.291 --> 01:18.009
You're lost?
- Lost?

01:18.099 --> 01:20.590
Okay, okay..
Where are you right now?

01:21.562 --> 01:23.506
look around and tell me what you see.

01:29.541 --> 01:31.915
... and I see some bushes,
and a tree..

01:32.851 --> 01:36.194
And a dog..
Boy dog

01:37.117 --> 01:39.676
And I see you.
- You're here.

01:41.497 --> 01:44.530
Where's the buggy?
- Open up the door.

01:47.949 --> 01:49.702
This is gonna be awesome.

01:49.885 --> 01:52.622
We can drive to the Zippy Mart whenever we want.

01:52.781 --> 01:55.422
We can drive girls to the Zippy Mart.
- Yes..

01:55.450 --> 02:00.314
'cause girls love convenience stores.
The buggy!

02:07.594 --> 02:09.209
That's it?

02:09.517 --> 02:12.371
What happened to it?
- You said it was in good shape.

02:12.410 --> 02:13.534
It is..

02:13.687 --> 02:15.299
You shoulda seen it before I fixed it up.

02:15.904 --> 02:18.767
Oh, now I'm all depressed.

02:18.864 --> 02:21.441
Wel-well, come on.
At least it runs..

02:23.153 --> 02:24.605
right?

02:24.650 --> 02:27.208
Oh yeah.
It runs.

02:27.236 --> 02:28.927
Cool!
Come on, Josh, jump in.

02:29.881 --> 02:32.519
Okay!
It's buggy time!

02:40.267 --> 02:42.050
You said it runs.

02:42.531 --> 02:45.515
Oh, you meant the dune buggy.

02:45.659 --> 02:47.762
Yeah, no..
That-that's broken.

02:48.992 --> 02:50.135
See ya.

02:53.050 --> 02:55.706
It's not buggy time..

02:56.185 --> 02:58.762
It's dead buggy time.

<i> ..I'm Tony Pajamas and from now on,
I ask the questions. Sit down. Sit down!</i>

03:58.183 --> 04:00.101
You're still researching?
- Yeah..

04:00.117 --> 04:02.944
I found all kinds of great stuff on
how to repair a dune buggy.

04:03.473 --> 04:06.127
You've done enough research. Come on.
Let's go get started on it.

04:06.849 --> 04:09.494
Quit it.
I'm tryin' to read a website on tires.

04:09.851 --> 04:12.721
Come on. We use some tools.
We tighten things..

04:12.929 --> 04:17.392
you know.. Maybe throw some oil in the
oil hole and we're good to go.

04:18.261 --> 04:19.505
Oil hole?

04:19.678 --> 04:22.986
Quit whappin' my head!
- Then come on.

04:36.226 --> 04:38.354
You see what you do?

04:38.808 --> 04:43.861
You did it first!
- , but my pillow didn't cause anything to explode.

04:47.759 --> 04:50.581
What are we gonna do?
Mom and dad are gonna kill us!

04:50.707 --> 04:52.646
No they won't..

04:52.884 --> 04:54.540
They're gonna kill you.

04:55.281 --> 04:59.217
You're the one who ducked!
You ducker!

04:59.927 --> 05:03.546
Oh, I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
- Dude..

05:04.100 --> 05:07.691
there is a very easy way out of this.
- What?

05:07.744 --> 05:09.506
Lie.
- Lie?

05:09.512 --> 05:11.952
Lie.
- Lie.

05:14.148 --> 05:19.606
Yeah. If mom and dad ask about the TV,
you don't know what happened.

05:19.783 --> 05:24.280
But-but that's not the truth.
- Which is why they call it lying.

05:25.318 --> 05:27.811
I don't know.
Lying.

05:27.855 --> 05:30.207
It seems so wrong.
- You wanna get grounded?

05:30.249 --> 05:32.631
But it feels so right.

05:41.183 --> 05:43.582
Boys, where's the remote?

05:45.858 --> 05:49.811
Uh, I-I don't know..
I-I-I-I think it's lost.

05:50.034 --> 05:52.249
Why-why don't you read a book?

05:53.370 --> 05:55.691
I already took algebra.

05:57.071 --> 05:59.195
What-what-what are you doing?

05:59.814 --> 06:03.901
You know, you can walk over
to the TV and turn it on by hand.

06:04.207 --> 06:09.685
That's crazy talk. What is this?
The old west? Yeehaw! No.

06:11.491 --> 06:15.059
Is there something on TV you don't want me to see?
- No, I just..

06:18.446 --> 06:21.689
It's not working.
- Well I'm thinkin' I don't.

06:21.860 --> 06:25.038
Josh!
- It was the pillow! A pillow!

06:25.106 --> 06:31.831
 I threw it and it hit the soda and the root beer
with the spilling on the TV and then.. pboom!

06:36.760 --> 06:41.170
Look, Josh. I don't care about
the pillow. I don't care about the TV.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.406
You don't?
- No. I care that you lied to me.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.846
I'm really disappointed in you.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.891
I'm sorry.
- You should be.

06:50.476 --> 06:54.349
So, am I grounded for breaking the TV?
- No..

06:54.890 --> 06:57.966
You're grounded for lying to me.

06:59.062 --> 07:03.018
And, you're gonna have to do a lot
more work around this house.

07:08.561 --> 07:13.656
I drink root beer..
You don't see me exploding!

07:23.045 --> 07:27.046
Dune buggy's lookin' good.
You got a lot done.

07:27.047 --> 07:31.376
Well. I've had a lot of time
since I'm grounded for lying!

07:33.040 --> 07:38.751
Of course, I get to do fun
chores like scrubbing the toilets!

07:39.600 --> 07:43.351
You might wanna scrub the upstairs
one again. Sorry.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.489
I never should have let you
convince me to lie.

07:47.533 --> 07:52.352
You didn't get in trouble for lying.
You got in trouble for lying badly.

07:52.713 --> 07:57.676
It's not fair! You never get in trouble!
You get away with everything!

07:58.006 --> 08:02.465
Yeah. I do, don't  I?
So, you got this thing runnin' yet?

08:02.538 --> 08:05.602
Not yet. But close.
Gimme a hand.

08:07.205 --> 08:09.248
What do these two wires go to?

08:13.083 --> 08:16.086
I think maybe it's the horn!

08:27.013 --> 08:30.938
Dare I?
- Do it!

08:32.821 --> 08:34.746
Yes!
- Yeah!

08:35.138 --> 08:36.980
Tunes!

08:44.224 --> 08:47.361
Uh, guys?
- Hey how cool is this thing?

08:47.409 --> 08:49.940
You wanna see us take it out for a spin?
Go, Drake.

08:50.066 --> 08:51.687
Honey?

08:53.741 --> 08:57.337
What?
- You can't drive this out in the street!

08:57.428 --> 09:00.008
Sure we can!
- This thing'll do 50!

09:00.270 --> 09:04.117
I mean you're not allowed to drive it.
- Why not?

09:04.153 --> 09:06.803
Why? You're too young.
- You don't have driver's liscenses.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.792
It's dangerous.
- thing can't be street legal.

09:09.843 --> 09:13.641
It-it doesn't even have turn signals.
- Oh, n-n-n-n-no. That's why I have Josh. Look.

09:13.817 --> 09:16.545
Left!
Right!

09:17.388 --> 09:19.525
See?
- Sorry guys.

09:19.652 --> 09:24.190
Nope.
- Why'd you let us fix it up if you weren't gonna let us drive it?

09:24.365 --> 09:27.527
We never thought you'd actually get it running.

09:28.145 --> 09:32.385
 Look, when we go up to the lake this summer,
we can take it along, you'll drive it there.

09:32.465 --> 09:36.273
Slowly.. With helmets on..
And bubble wrap.

09:36.714 --> 09:40.857
'Till then, it stays in the garage.
We clear?

09:41.001 --> 09:43.537
Yeah..
- We're clear.

09:46.558 --> 09:50.149
Well I'm not just gonna sit in here.

09:51.205 --> 09:53.648
Me neither.

10:10.050 --> 10:13.145
Who mops?
- I'll tell you who mops..

10:13.242 --> 10:17.046
young men who get punished because
you talked 'em into lying.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.852
Once again, you were not
punished because you lied

10:19.860 --> 10:24.864
I know: I got punished because I lied badly.
Sing a new song, would you?

10:26.743 --> 10:30.809
Hey. Mom and dad still gone?
- Yeah, why?

10:31.668 --> 10:34.806
Let's take the dune buggy out before they get back.

10:34.865 --> 10:38.258
Didn't you listen? We're not allowed.
- I know..

10:38.299 --> 10:41.026
That's why I said: "before they get back".

10:41.758 --> 10:44.773
Not unh. It's too risky.
I'll get caught.

10:44.806 --> 10:48.461
No, cause you'll be with me.
And I never get caught, remember?

10:48.462 --> 10:53.738
Yeah. But you'll be with me. And I always get caught.
I'm already grounded.

10:53.808 --> 10:58.450
So you have nothing to loose.
- You wanna get in trouble and end up mopping floors like me?

10:59.303 --> 11:01.895
Will I get to wear that purdy apron?

11:02.765 --> 11:05.158
Come on, let's just go for a spin.

11:05.224 --> 11:11.844
No means no.
And thank you for germin' up the family juice.

11:11.967 --> 11:14.025
Fine. You win.

11:14.462 --> 11:18.900
Fun crusher!
- Juice germer!

11:23.648 --> 11:26.666
I'm telling mom you drank out of the carton.

11:40.794 --> 11:43.930
Hey baby.
Want a ride?

11:44.226 --> 11:48.187
Yeah, I thought so.
Hop in.

11:50.828 --> 11:54.956
You look good!
Let's go.

12:02.005 --> 12:06.213
Wha-wha-what's that baby?
You want me to pull over here so we can make out?

12:06.345 --> 12:09.355
Well, if that's what you want baby.
Pucker up.

12:09.369 --> 12:10.732
Well, okay.

12:11.797 --> 12:15.582
What are you doing here?
- I just came to see how the dune buggy's comin'.

12:15.692 --> 12:19.985
It's lookin' good.
- Not just lookin' good. Listen.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.258
You got in running!
- Yeah, get in.

12:27.648 --> 12:29.095
Trevor?
- Yeah?

12:29.102 --> 12:35.207
Maybe you wanna sit in the passenger's seat?
- I don't know. You got a comfy lap.

12:35.872 --> 12:37.552
Move.

12:40.675 --> 12:45.514
The motor sounds great!
- Yeah. You know where it'd sound even better?

12:46.732 --> 12:48.907
In the shower.

12:49.003 --> 12:52.468
On the road!
- Better.

12:52.477 --> 12:55.680
But you can't tell Josh and my parents we took it out,
'cause they'll freak.

12:55.686 --> 12:58.704
I won't say a word.
Now let's hit it.

13:02.393 --> 13:04.220
Squirrel!

13:04.611 --> 13:06.157
Tree!

13:23.550 --> 13:26.095
Name please.
- I'm Drake Parker.

13:26.454 --> 13:30.111
How did this happen, Drake?
- I was driving a dune buggy..

13:31.004 --> 13:34.528
we hit a tree,
flipped over and I kinda fell out.

13:34.673 --> 13:40.216
I see. Well, you didn't break anything,
but you've got a few bad sprains..

13:40.222 --> 13:44.225
and some pretty serious bruises on
your hip and around your rib cage.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.930
Try to stand up for me.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.068
Man, that hurts.

13:53.153 --> 13:55.567
You'll be okay kid.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.128
Don't do that.

13:59.203 --> 14:01.464
Now he tells me.

14:02.043 --> 14:07.028
<i>Doctor Calvatino, to the OR, please.
I repeat: Doctor Calvatino, to the OR, please.</i>

14:07.099 --> 14:11.238
So am I gonna be okay?
- You're gonna be very sore for a while..

14:11.422 --> 14:15.768
but if you stay in bed and take it easy,
you should feel better in a couple of weeks.

14:16.192 --> 14:21.760
I'm a little concerned about you, though.
You might wanna get a brain scan.

14:21.782 --> 14:25.172
No thanks.
My folks make me get one every month!

14:25.182 --> 14:27.467
Yes, I bet they do.

14:32.371 --> 14:37.114
Okay, look: My parents and Josh
can not find out about this.

14:37.182 --> 14:40.701
 I'll try and figure out a way to hide the
dune buggy so they won't see it's wrecked.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.857
Okay, but they're gonna figure it out.
I mean, you can barely stand up.

14:44.195 --> 14:46.409
Yeah? Watch this.

14:56.307 --> 15:01.466
You see? I look fine. Just put a little makeup
on the cuts and no one knows a thing.

15:01.486 --> 15:04.220
You're good man.
Real good.

15:16.112 --> 15:20.237
Ow. Ow. Owwww are you, Josh?
- Fine..

15:20.275 --> 15:22.090
why'd you cover up the dune buggy?

15:22.129 --> 15:27.035
we're not allowed to drive it.
We shouldn't let it get all dusty, right?

15:27.141 --> 15:30.900
Yeah. But I thought it would be fun to sit in
there and pretend like we're driving it..

15:31.043 --> 15:33.517
we could make the noises and everything!

15:33.908 --> 15:37.301
That's a little dorky, don't you think?
- Yeah. I guess..

15:37.414 --> 15:40.948
but I just thought we could hop in and..
- Why don't we just play a video game..

15:44.872 --> 15:45.550
Great.

15:48.765 --> 15:52.038
Hey, you want something to drink?
- Yes, sure.

15:52.561 --> 15:56.207
Oh, uh oh. You got a little dirt on your shirt.

16:08.925 --> 16:14.205
Honey, look. Megan fell asleep while we
were gardening. How cute is she?

16:14.210 --> 16:16.500
What an angel.
- Hey, Drake..

16:16.645 --> 16:19.108
do me a favor.
Carry Megan upstairs for me would you?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.616
But she's heavy.

16:21.913 --> 16:25.551
What? I've seen you carry her upstairs
a dozen times. Come on.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.498
Okay.

16:38.347 --> 16:41.979
Drake, are you crying?
- What's wrong?

16:42.784 --> 16:46.429
She's just.. so cute.

16:50.779 --> 16:53.857
Can't we just leave her here
so we can look at her?

16:54.857 --> 16:56.154
Drake.

16:59.422 --> 17:01.268
Hello, buggy.

17:06.996 --> 17:10.181
Hello.
No, this is Drake's brother.

17:11.662 --> 17:14.655
He left his wallet in the emergency room?

17:14.847 --> 17:16.935
Wait. When was Drake in the..

17:17.376 --> 17:20.031
After the dune buggy accident?

17:27.184 --> 17:29.854
Oh yeah, I'll tell 'im.
Yeah.

17:29.888 --> 17:34.544
Oh, yes.
He's still very sore.

17:34.839 --> 17:37.656
Oh I'll make sure he gets lots of rest.

17:38.543 --> 17:39.559
Bye.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.200
Hey dad.
Drake.

17:51.207 --> 17:52.470
'Sup?
- Hey Josh.

17:53.355 --> 17:58.550
You know Dad, I was thinking about
trying out for the wrestling team at school.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.182
Really?
- You think you could show me some moves?

18:02.505 --> 18:05.136
Sure.
Yeah. Step over here.

18:09.973 --> 18:13.420
But I won't be able to watch the
moves if you do 'em on me.

18:13.451 --> 18:16.551
Oh yeah. Uh, Drake, come here.

18:18.885 --> 18:22.918
I'd rather not.
- Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:26.759 --> 18:31.366
Anything wrong?
- No.. I'm well.

18:31.940 --> 18:35.518
Come on, let's see some moves!
- Okey dokey. Uh, alright..

18:35.679 --> 18:39.458
this is the classic Full Nelson.

18:39.470 --> 18:45.761
Cool. Show me more.
- Sure. the most important move is the take down.

18:46.646 --> 18:50.848
May I see this take down?
- Alright. Here.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.490
Drake you face me.

18:55.150 --> 18:59.883
Alright. Josh, count me in.
- 1.. 2.. 3.. Attack Drake!

19:05.533 --> 19:08.750
Boys. No wrestling in the house.

19:08.759 --> 19:10.628
I love you mom.

19:11.573 --> 19:13.862
Megan, dinner's almost already.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.710
Josh.. May I please see you in our room?

19:18.886 --> 19:21.379
Is there a proble..
- Room!

19:27.386 --> 19:30.256
You, uh, wanted to chat?

19:31.584 --> 19:34.096
Why did you make him attack me?

19:34.282 --> 19:37.472
'Cause it's about time you stop
getting away with everything.

19:37.478 --> 19:39.715
What is that supposed t..
- You threw the pillows..

19:39.724 --> 19:43.276
you talked me into lying about the TV!
You got me grounded..

19:43.372 --> 19:47.188
and you took our dune buggy out when
you weren't supposed to and you wrecked it!

19:48.909 --> 19:51.577
What-what're what're you talking about?

19:51.585 --> 19:55.919
I got a call from the emergency room.
You left your wallet there.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.433
Yeah. And I saw the buggy!

20:00.835 --> 20:03.202
Do mom and dad know?
- They're gonna.

20:05.002 --> 20:08.652
Don't you do that to me.
- Fine! You tell 'em.

20:09.103 --> 20:12.434
Are you crazy?
- No. I'm honest.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.040
What?
- I'm grounded for two weeks.

20:15.054 --> 20:18.136
Josh you know what..
- We spent like a hundred hours on that dune buggy..

20:18.140 --> 20:20.950
 trying to fix it up and you ruined it!

20:20.952 --> 20:22.966
And you're hurt.

20:22.968 --> 20:25.401
But all you can think about is
getting away with it.

20:25.457 --> 20:29.501
<i>"Ooh, I'm Drake! I'm so cool,
I get away with everything."</i>

20:30.973 --> 20:37.717
Fine. I'll just stay grounded and I'll
fix the dune buggy.. Again.

20:38.740 --> 20:41.306
And you just keep worryin' about yourself.

20:42.404 --> 20:44.774
It's what you're best at.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.857
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not so..

21:00.408 --> 21:04.635
Josh, hey what's going on with Drake?
- Yeah he's been acting pretty weird.

21:04.641 --> 21:08.000
Is he okay?
- Um, yeah. He's fine. He's just a little..

21:08.003 --> 21:09.290
- No..

21:09.714 --> 21:11.758
he's not okay.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.107
I'm kinda banged up.

21:14.110 --> 21:17.940
You hurt him wrestling!
- I did?

21:19.014 --> 21:21.430
It-it wasn't the wrestling.

21:22.308 --> 21:24.125
It was a car accident.

21:24.134 --> 21:28.912
Car accident?
- He's gonna get it now!

21:29.693 --> 21:33.453
Actually, it was a-a dune buggy accident.
- What?

21:34.441 --> 21:36.698
Are you okay?
- Well, the doctor sai..

21:36.699 --> 21:38.324
Wait, wait, wait..
What doctor?

21:38.914 --> 21:43.480
I kinda went to the OR and got X-rayed and stuff.
- Here it comes!

21:43.481 --> 21:46.403
My poor baby.
- Huh?!

21:49.019 --> 21:52.495
Just look at you.
You can barely stand.

21:52.609 --> 21:56.609
Easy, easy, easy.
Everything hurts.

21:57.402 --> 22:01.354
I'm really sorry I disobeyed you.
I shouldn't have.

22:01.770 --> 22:04.403
Now he gets it.

22:04.677 --> 22:07.900
Josh.. Did you know about this?

22:08.084 --> 22:11.480
Well-well yeah I knew..
- You still made your father wrestle him?

22:11.486 --> 22:15.020
When you knew Drake was hurt?
-  Wait secon..

22:15.031 --> 22:20.552
Guys, guys.. Go easy on him.
He's a good kid.

22:21.901 --> 22:28.477
And about the TV getting broken,
that was really kinda my fault. And..

22:30.005 --> 22:33.273
I talked Josh into lying about it.

22:38.067 --> 22:40.415
We'll discuss this later.

22:40.686 --> 22:42.860
What else did the doctor say?

22:43.060 --> 22:46.516
That I should stay in bed and just
rest for a couple of weeks.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.070
Well that's gonna be easy.
'Cause you're grounded.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.025
Finally!

22:53.436 --> 22:57.128
Oh yeah! You're grounded. You're grounded.
What are you doin' tomorrow? You're grounded.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.360
Pizza's here.
- Thanks.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.403
What are you smiling about?
- The great Drake..

23:14.562 --> 23:18.211
Grounded for two weeks!
I love it.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.490
Yep, me too.

23:22.408 --> 23:24.973
Two weeks. Layin' in bed.
No school..

23:25.113 --> 23:27.261
playin' a little guitar.
Watchin' a little TV..

23:27.377 --> 23:31.986

Being grounded is baaaad!

23:32.462 --> 23:34.117
Uh, but I don't underst..
- Hold that thought..

23:34.119 --> 23:37.609
hey dad could you bring me up a root beer,
a couple magazines, and..

23:37.610 --> 23:40.355
in about twenty minutes,
maybe a little ice cream?

23:40.357 --> 23:42.603
Sure. I'll get Josh right on it.

23:42.609 --> 23:48.021
Josh!
- Aw, come on!
