maybe we should, get married.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.152
Look, I got nothing against
marriage, it's just, you know,

04:12.185 --> 04:15.022
we should get married when we're

can go out that exit.

Yeah, I can find a way.

42:26.477 --> 42:29.915
All right, then the two of
you will have to go and get

42:29.948 --> 42:30.982
out there and bring help.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.483
So why don't you
come with us?

42:32.517 --> 42:33.184

42:34.185 --> 42:35.420
Why?

42:35.453 --> 42:36.955
Because it's my job.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.024
Yeah but I'm not too
crazy about this idea.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.258

sing about falling

42:40.291 --> 42:41.760

42:41.793 --> 42:43.428
especially with those
things out there.

talking about back there anyway?

43:14.159 --> 43:19.197
There's demonic power
here, I can feel it.

43:19.230 --> 43:21.833
It must be some sort of
satanic ritual or something.

It must be trying to
conjure something up.

It's taken all my strength
just to animate these toys.

Good, I have a very
special surprise for you.

of him, do you understand?

Yes.

Come, dear.

50:48.913 --> 50:51.716
he will find a little
baby to grow inside of.
