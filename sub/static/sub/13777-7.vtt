WEBVTT

00:00.463 --> 00:02.463
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

00:02.568 --> 00:04.152
You guys getting, uh,
pretty religious, huh?

00:04.287 --> 00:06.247
No, we just dropped the kids
off at Sunday school.

00:06.289 --> 00:08.456
Yeah, we think it's nice for
them to get a moral boost that

00:08.574 --> 00:10.458
they may not be receiving at
home.

00:10.576 --> 00:12.496
And we get to watch football
with no kids around.

00:12.578 --> 00:14.462
Wait, aren't you
supposed to be in church while

00:14.580 --> 00:16.464
the kids are at Sunday school?
I don't think they check.

00:16.582 --> 00:18.550
No, it's not like it's a
commandment.

00:18.668 --> 00:20.752
Taco Corp is in a state
of emergency.

00:20.886 --> 00:23.505
The EBDB's been compromised.
A brute force attack by the

00:23.639 --> 00:26.391
Chinese crashed the EBDB and
left it vulnerable to hackers

00:26.509 --> 00:28.426
breaking in through the back
door.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.762
What are you talking about?
Last night I was driving the

00:30.846 --> 00:33.315
EBDB van and I got into an
accident with the delivery guy

00:33.432 --> 00:35.934
from the Chinese market.
After that, the back door

00:36.102 --> 00:38.236
wouldn't close right.
And in the middle of the night,

00:38.354 --> 00:40.772
someone broke into the van and
stole my Walkman.

00:40.906 --> 00:42.774
So what?
On that tape was a recording

00:42.908 --> 00:44.868
of me reading the entire Eskimo
Brothers Database.

00:44.910 --> 00:46.778
Ooh...
Scandal.

00:46.912 --> 00:48.780
This never would've happened
before Mark from Cuba took over

00:48.914 --> 00:50.782
the company.
You know what I think?

00:50.916 --> 00:52.784
The Chinese are in bed with the
Cubans.

00:52.918 --> 00:56.788
Sounds like we're on the verge of a
Mark Cuban missile crisis. Yeah. Yeah.

00:56.922 --> 00:58.790
Ooh!
Oh.

00:58.924 --> 01:00.792
Oh!

01:00.926 --> 01:02.794
Oh, my...
Rat! Kill it!

01:02.928 --> 01:06.514
No, this is not a rat.
This is Milady.

01:06.632 --> 01:09.384
Milady?
I rescued her.

01:09.518 --> 01:11.970
And in many respects, I think
she rescued me.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.939
Now let's get you some kibble.
Isn't that right? Come on. Yes.

01:15.057 --> 01:19.561
Ew! God, Andre.
Oh, boy.

01:19.695 --> 01:21.536
Oh, my God, this is...
It's like it's too easy.

01:21.647 --> 01:22.564
Oh, wow.
I know.

01:22.698 --> 01:24.566
We could literally sit here
all day long and make jokes

01:24.700 --> 01:26.568
about how Andre's finally
getting some...

01:26.702 --> 01:28.570
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We got to challenge ourselves,

01:28.704 --> 01:30.789
Pete.
Oh, come on. It's such

01:30.906 --> 01:33.041
low-hanging pussy fruit.
Look, we could still make the

01:33.159 --> 01:36.161
jokes-- we just omit the word.
Okay, first person to break

01:36.328 --> 01:38.880
and make a pussy joke has to
give up their best running back.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.882
Wow.
Ooh, that has some teeth.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.884
I like that.
I like that, too.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.886
All right, we're doing this.
As league commissioner, I

01:45.004 --> 01:46.888
sanction this bet.
Yeah?

01:47.006 --> 01:48.890
Let's shake on it.
Yeah.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.892
Come on.
Yeah, it figures, Andre

01:51.010 --> 01:53.011
finally gets some pussy and it's
dirty and hairy from the street.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.013
What is that?
You can't do that.

01:55.181 --> 02:00.396
I didn't shake on it yet. I got one.
Uh, Andre... Aw... It's official.

02:00.762 --> 02:04.570
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:04.690 --> 02:06.574
You know, it's probably just
stress-related.

02:06.692 --> 02:09.077
I'm the current champ in my
fantasy football league.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.529
A lot of pressure to repeat.
Well, you definitely have

02:11.664 --> 02:13.531
some blockage, and it can be a
lot of things.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.618
It could be diverticulitis or
just a sluggish bowel, so I'm

02:16.752 --> 02:18.620
gonna need a stool sample from
you.

02:18.754 --> 02:21.372
What? Ew.
Okay.

02:21.507 --> 02:23.425
No. Oh.
That's my coffee.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.961
Oh.
No, I'm gonna get you a kit.

02:27.096 --> 02:30.548
And over the next several days,
you're going to deposit your

02:30.716 --> 02:32.717
fecal matter in it.
It's like a yogurt spoon.

02:32.885 --> 02:35.470
And it can be used that way
but, for this, feces.

02:35.604 --> 02:38.106
Put 'em in the blue bags, one
per day.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.308
You tie it up and you put it in
the freezer.

02:40.443 --> 02:42.323
Then in three days...
I'm sorry, I put it in the

02:42.445 --> 02:44.312
freezer?
You can put it in the back so

02:44.447 --> 02:47.065
you don't get confused.
And then, in three days, just

02:47.233 --> 02:50.735
come back to the office and
we'll check it out.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.737
All right, well, thanks for
being really cool about this and

02:52.905 --> 02:54.989
not laughing at me.
Why would I laugh?

02:55.124 --> 02:57.125
You're making me poop in a bag.

02:57.243 --> 02:59.163
Poop's not funny.
Poop actually put my three kids

02:59.245 --> 03:01.129
through college.
Where did they go?

03:01.247 --> 03:03.414
Brown University?
My youngest did.

03:03.582 --> 03:07.452
Really?
I've recently come into some

03:07.586 --> 03:09.420
money, so I'm looking for a
place to live.

03:09.588 --> 03:11.422
Oh, so you're still at your
old place?

03:11.590 --> 03:13.842
Old place...?
My place.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.227
Oh.<i> Mon Dieu.</i>
Hey, hey.

03:16.345 --> 03:18.229
Andre, this is, uh, my friend
Penny.

03:18.347 --> 03:22.233
Hello. How are you? Andre is a plastic
surgeon here. Number one in Chicago.

03:22.351 --> 03:24.269
Okay, there's that, yeah.
Penny runs this really cool kind

03:24.403 --> 03:26.271
of pet grooming company, so...
Pet grooming, that's such a

03:26.405 --> 03:28.273
growth market.
I love it.

03:28.407 --> 03:30.275
Oh, thank you.
I'm-I'm really excited because

03:30.409 --> 03:32.443
it's brand-new and it's, like,
got some edge to it.

03:32.578 --> 03:38.283
Okay. You know, for pets with attitude,
there is "Cattitude." I love it.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.451
I loved it, too.
Yeah!

03:40.586 --> 03:42.453
I still don't get it.
You gotta get a cat an

03:42.588 --> 03:44.756
attitude.
Oh, speaking of, I have to go

03:44.874 --> 03:47.458
pick up my new business cards.
Okeydokey.

03:47.593 --> 03:49.460
So, um, it was so great
meeting you guys.

03:49.595 --> 03:52.764
Um...<i> à tout à l'heure.</i>
<i>Au revoir.</i>

03:52.882 --> 03:55.266
What?
Is she French?

03:55.384 --> 03:57.936
Uh, no.
Is she Canadian?

03:58.053 --> 04:00.221
No.
Cajun?

04:00.356 --> 04:02.690
No, she, um... she just
thinks, you know, speaking in

04:02.808 --> 04:05.643
French is classy, so...
In my experience, people that

04:05.778 --> 04:07.979
use the word "classy" are rarely
ever classy.

04:08.113 --> 04:10.615
Yeah, it's a paradox.
Like Schrodinger's cat.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.067
What's Schrodinger's cat?
All right, there's a box and

04:13.202 --> 04:15.682
inside that box there's a cat,
but you don't know if it's alive

04:15.738 --> 04:19.624
or dead. But if you open the box, you
kill the cat. Well, in my experience,

04:19.742 --> 04:21.625
keeping the box closed kills the
cat.

04:21.744 --> 04:23.878
It's another paradox.
No, I know the cat's dead.

04:23.996 --> 04:25.964
It stops moving.
All right, don't... Please.

04:26.081 --> 04:28.499
Oh, I should ask Penny for help.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.419
<i>ChiTown Style's</i> doing a, uh...
a piece on professionals and

04:31.554 --> 04:34.672
their pets, and I'm gonna do a
little spread with Milady.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.759
Okay, so you're doing a
spread for camera, and you're

04:37.893 --> 04:39.761
gonna show your... Milady?
Yeah!

04:39.895 --> 04:41.763
You got to make sure it's
nice and trim.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.765
I mean, this isn't the late '70s
anymore.

04:43.899 --> 04:46.234
You don't want some wild, hairy,
crazy... feline.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.236
No.
Oh, my God. No way.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.238
When the hair's all over the
place, it makes her look way

04:50.356 --> 04:52.240
older.
Well, you know what a lot of

04:52.358 --> 04:55.360
people are doing now, they're
just waxing their-their

04:55.527 --> 04:57.579
Miladies.
I don't think that the cat

04:57.696 --> 04:59.581
would stand for that.
It's pretty painful.

04:59.698 --> 05:01.698
There are a lot of hairless
cats though, I noticed.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.585
I don't want a hairless Milady.

05:03.702 --> 05:05.837
I like a little bit of fur there
just so I can kind of get lost

05:05.955 --> 05:09.007
in it when I touch it.
Oh, that reminds me, can I shoot

05:09.124 --> 05:11.042
this at your house?
Why?

05:11.176 --> 05:13.294
Well, 'cause you have that
place set and if this works out

05:13.429 --> 05:16.097
as good as I think it will, you
might have a centerfold of me

05:16.215 --> 05:18.883
playing with Milady on your
front lawn.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.885
Great.
Wow.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.021
Oh, my gosh, it's, uh, Devin
from my spin class.

05:23.138 --> 05:25.106
I want to talk to you about that
mix I sent you.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.358
Okay, look, you have an
opportunity to pull an

05:27.476 --> 05:29.677
unbelievable prank on Andre.
What are you talking about?

05:29.778 --> 05:32.647
Just tell Penny that Andre
wants Milady groomed with a ton

05:32.781 --> 05:36.067
of cattitude.
I mean, cattitude for days.

05:36.201 --> 05:38.786
That way when she's done, Milady
will look as ridiculous as

05:38.904 --> 05:40.538
Andre.
Oh, this is brilliant.

05:40.656 --> 05:42.073
Yeah.
This is huge.

05:42.207 --> 05:44.167
Guys, I know we're not
allowed to make pussy jokes

05:44.209 --> 05:46.744
about Andre's cat, but can we at
least make jokes about Andre's

05:46.912 --> 05:49.664
cat's actual vagina?
I got a good look at it, and it

05:49.798 --> 05:54.302
is disgusting.
Looks like Jabba the Hutt's eye.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.421
I can't believe I'm doing this.

05:56.588 --> 06:01.643
All right, I'm just gonna tuck
you right in there.

06:01.760 --> 06:08.266
Cover you with vegetables...
and a bogey.

06:08.434 --> 06:12.103
Yeah. Great.
I have built myself a little

06:12.271 --> 06:15.106
feces fort.
Oh, my God, you scared me.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.775
Hey.
You and Daddy are sinners.

06:17.943 --> 06:20.778
Who told you that?
You worship false idols.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.780
I learned about it in Sunday
school.

06:22.915 --> 06:26.117
We don't worship false idols.
What about this?

06:26.285 --> 06:30.505
That is the Shiva.
Then destroy the Shiva.

06:30.622 --> 06:32.674
What?! You watch your mouth,
lady.

06:32.791 --> 06:36.177
See? Sinners!
Enjoy your eternity in Hell!

06:36.295 --> 06:38.379
Ugh, I'm already there.
Sinner!

06:38.514 --> 06:40.848
She's crazy.
She directly takes after your

06:40.966 --> 06:44.852
mother. Ignore her like you do my mom.
How was that doctor's

06:44.970 --> 06:46.930
appointment the other day?
You know, it was great.

06:46.972 --> 06:49.524
Everything good?
Yeah. Everything is great.

06:49.641 --> 06:53.144
Ooh.
Ew, peas.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.564
Ew...
Ooh, pizza bites!

06:56.699 --> 07:01.319
Pizza bites.

07:01.453 --> 07:04.205
These are really weird requests.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.874
Are you sure he wants his cat to
look like this for the photo

07:06.992 --> 07:08.960
shoot?
Have you met Andre?

07:09.078 --> 07:10.628
Yeah, you're right.
That's a stupid question.

07:10.746 --> 07:12.630
All right, good.
I'm just really nervous

07:12.748 --> 07:16.417
because this is a big
opportunity for me because Andre

07:16.552 --> 07:18.669
said that if he loves my work,
he's gonna recommend me to all

07:18.837 --> 07:21.506
of his clients.
And you know those ladies perm

07:21.640 --> 07:23.508
their poodles on a regular
basis.

07:23.642 --> 07:27.428
Oh, so this is big?
<i>Oui. Très masse.</i>

07:27.563 --> 07:32.517
And you were so nice to set this
up for me that I really want to

07:32.684 --> 07:35.737
do something nice for you.
I... I was not nice.

07:35.854 --> 07:37.355
I would've done it for anybody.
That's fine. Fine.

07:37.489 --> 07:43.694
No, you are helping turn
Cattitude from this dream I had

07:43.829 --> 07:47.782
at Burning Man to a reality.
Mmm.

07:47.916 --> 07:50.785
Mmm. Okay.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.094
I got that pickup game
tonight for basketball.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.096
You want to come?
Mm, I can't.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.764
Penny is taking me out for a
special celebratory dinner to

08:01.932 --> 08:04.800
thank me for getting her the
Andre job.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.921
So, how's the prank coming
along?

08:07.056 --> 08:10.758
Yeah. To be honest, I'm feeling a
little conflicted about the prank.

08:10.893 --> 08:12.760
There's, like, feelings to
consider, and...

08:12.895 --> 08:14.762
What?!
Look, Andre is gonna be super

08:14.897 --> 08:16.764
pissed when he finds out about
the prank, okay?

08:16.899 --> 08:18.900
Yeah.
And Penny's just having her

08:19.018 --> 08:20.902
business starting out, and you
know how huge Andre's presence

08:21.020 --> 08:22.904
is on Yelp.
Yeah, he gave me a two-star

08:23.022 --> 08:24.906
review of Pubercuts.
That almost killed me.

08:25.024 --> 08:26.824
He's gonna neg her business
to death, and then Penny and I

08:26.942 --> 08:28.910
are just gonna be...

08:29.028 --> 08:30.912
Maybe.
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

08:31.030 --> 08:34.582
Maybe? Oh... But it's still funny as balls.
Yeah. Super funny, so, you

08:34.700 --> 08:36.200
have to... you have to do it.
Yeah. You have to do it.

08:36.335 --> 08:37.835
What do you mean, I have...?
I don't have to do anything.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.671
Yes, you do.
You have to do the prank.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.539
We thought of a great prank, and
now it has to be done.

08:41.674 --> 08:43.624
Look at this.
Text from Penny.

08:43.759 --> 08:45.460
"OMG. So excited for tonight,
<i>mon cher."</i>

08:45.627 --> 08:47.462
She's so excited!
Yes!

08:47.629 --> 08:49.464
Yes, but she does that
annoying French thing.

08:49.631 --> 08:51.466
Look, you are this league's
historian.

08:51.633 --> 08:54.686
You want people looking back and
saying, "Oh, in 2014, I think

08:54.803 --> 08:58.473
Pete dated a girl for a couple
months", or "In 2014, Pete

08:58.607 --> 09:01.976
Eckhart pulled off the greatest
prank of all time"?

09:02.111 --> 09:03.978
Yes, because he did that
messed up thing to Andre's...

09:04.113 --> 09:05.980
Aah!
No. I didn't say it.

09:06.115 --> 09:07.982
I didn't say it.
You were on the cliff.

09:08.117 --> 09:12.870
You almost did. No, I didn't
even hit the first "S." Hey...

09:12.988 --> 09:15.406
look who made it.
Father Muldoon, how are you?

09:15.541 --> 09:17.742
Hey, your, uh, your
daughter Ellie-- she's doing

09:17.876 --> 09:19.877
great, really taking to the
scripture.

09:19.995 --> 09:22.080
Oh, we've-we've noticed.
It's a great opportunity,

09:22.214 --> 09:24.215
'cause it lets you guys come to
Mass.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.050
It's been a really great
experience for all of us.

09:26.168 --> 09:27.885
Hey, where were you guys last
Sunday?

09:28.003 --> 09:29.837
I was looking for you.
We were, like, right by

09:29.972 --> 09:31.839
the... the stained glass.
Which one?

09:31.974 --> 09:34.092
The one with the woman
kissing the little kid...

09:34.226 --> 09:36.094
The baby Jesus.
That's a baby?

09:36.228 --> 09:38.096
Listen, I'm just, uh, glad
you guys are getting in there.

09:38.230 --> 09:40.098
It's nice.
Yeah, I know-- it's just a

09:40.232 --> 09:41.766
great experience for our whole
family, you know, because Ellie

09:41.900 --> 09:43.601
gets to go to the daycare, we
get to go to Mass.

09:43.736 --> 09:45.603
Sunday school.
Yes.

09:45.738 --> 09:47.438
It's not a baby-sitting
service, it's a Sunday school.

09:47.573 --> 09:49.323
It's the Lord's daycare,
because he's a shepherd, watches

09:49.441 --> 09:51.325
over the sheep with all...
You boys are ready?

09:51.443 --> 09:53.403
Oh. Yeah, let's do this.
It's game time. Let's go.

09:53.445 --> 09:55.329
You guys ready?
Yup.

09:55.447 --> 09:57.331
Stretch it out, come on.
Come on, let's do this.

09:57.449 --> 10:00.084
Try to keep up, padre.
Come on, bringing that... Oh!

10:00.202 --> 10:02.036
Come on. Oh, oh. Come on, geez.

10:05.007 --> 10:09.210
Oh, yeah, and the Lord said
"Let there be net!"

10:09.378 --> 10:11.212
Uh, uh, uh, uh, mm.
Ow!

10:11.380 --> 10:13.214
Oh, yeah.
What?

10:13.382 --> 10:15.049
Go, go, go!
No, you got it, you got it!

10:15.217 --> 10:16.884
Yeah! All in your face.
You like that? You like that?

10:17.052 --> 10:18.886
Oh, yeah!
He fouled me, man.

10:19.054 --> 10:21.556
Jesus Christ!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

10:21.723 --> 10:24.392
Sorry. Sorry.
Ball, ball. Hit it.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.394
Deliver us from... evil.
Oh! Oh, my...!

10:26.562 --> 10:28.446
Yeah! Yeah!
What the hell?!

10:28.564 --> 10:32.116
Shoot quicker!
He's fouling me every time!

10:32.234 --> 10:35.119
Yeah. What? Huh? What? Huh?

10:35.237 --> 10:37.455
Oh, yeah.
No.

10:37.573 --> 10:42.160
Uh... Ah! Holy Trinity!
Boom shakalaka.

10:46.248 --> 10:49.333
Oh, God!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

10:49.468 --> 10:51.335
No. Foul, man. Foul.
Huh?

10:51.470 --> 10:54.388
You keep pushing everyone.
I preach hard, I play hard.

10:54.506 --> 10:56.340
You got a problem with that?
No... Father.

10:56.475 --> 10:58.426
Huh? That's what I thought.
Whoo! Come on!

10:58.560 --> 11:02.430
God. Oh, look at this shiner that
this priest gave me in basketball.

11:02.598 --> 11:04.148
Guy's out of his mind.
He's fouling like crazy.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.484
Well, the heavenly fouler
works in mysterious ways.

11:06.602 --> 11:08.402
No, no. You know what?
I don't care what the guy does

11:08.520 --> 11:12.406
for a living. You get up in his
face, and you yell. He's right.

11:12.524 --> 11:15.276
I can't. Not only is the guy
my priest, but he's also my free

11:15.410 --> 11:18.329
daycare, so, show some respect.
Hey, is Penny gonna be ready

11:18.447 --> 11:20.331
tomorrow, for me to drop off
Milady?

11:20.449 --> 11:22.333
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?
That's really soon.

11:22.451 --> 11:24.368
Well, the shoot is this weekend.

11:24.503 --> 11:28.122
Yeah. Yeah, I just don't know if
Penny's ready yet to make that call...

11:28.257 --> 11:30.208
I'm sure her schedule's
probably open.

11:30.342 --> 11:32.126
Probably. I'll drop her off
tomorrow.

11:32.294 --> 11:34.128
Thank you.
That'll be great.

11:34.296 --> 11:35.963
You're all serious about
false idols!

11:36.131 --> 11:39.550
"Depart from me, ye cursed, into
the eternal fire that I prepare

11:39.685 --> 11:41.769
for the Devil and his angels."
Matthew 25:41.

11:41.887 --> 11:47.475
You know what? Depart from in front of
the TV, cursed. Uncle Pete, 8:18 p.m.

11:47.609 --> 11:49.777
Enough with this!
Go to your room!

11:49.895 --> 11:52.196
Go do homework or something
productive.

11:52.314 --> 11:54.315
You're all fornicators and
sodomites!

11:54.483 --> 11:57.818
Wow! The tiny televangelist
is a real bummer.

11:57.953 --> 11:59.904
She couldn't possibly know
what those words mean.

12:00.038 --> 12:01.822
Well, she did look at Andre
when she said "sodomite."

12:01.990 --> 12:03.708
I...
Yeah, and she didn't look at

12:03.825 --> 12:05.543
either of you guys when she said
"fornicators."

12:05.661 --> 12:09.413
Ha. Maybe this Sunday school daycare
idea has bit us in the ass.

12:09.548 --> 12:13.301
Yeah. Seems like you reap what you sow.
Really? You dare to stand on

12:13.418 --> 12:17.505
moral high ground?
You, who outsourced your team?

12:17.639 --> 12:19.340
What does that have to do
with anything?

12:19.508 --> 12:21.225
What?
Because you cheated, Andre.

12:21.343 --> 12:23.060
You cheated us, and you cheated
Shiva.

12:23.178 --> 12:26.063
Oh, I did not cheat Shiva.
Yeah. You owe us and Shiva

12:26.181 --> 12:28.065
ten Hail Shivas.
Right. Right now.

12:28.183 --> 12:30.067
I'm not doing that.
No.

12:30.185 --> 12:32.069
Do you want to win this year,
Andre?

12:32.187 --> 12:34.071
Okay, fine.
Twenty!

12:34.189 --> 12:36.274
Oh, hail Shiva, full of

12:36.408 --> 12:44.165
grace, my roster is with thee.
Oh, hail Shiva. Oh, hail Shiva.

12:44.283 --> 12:48.586
- Oh, hail Shiva.
- Oh, hail Shiva!

12:48.704 --> 12:53.424
Oh, hail Shiva.
Oh, hail Shiva.

12:53.542 --> 12:58.379
Oh, hail Shiva.
Oh, hail Shiva!

12:58.513 --> 13:03.768
Oh, hail Shiva!
Oh, hail Shiva...!

13:03.885 --> 13:07.722
Yes, hail Shiva.
Uh, gentlemen, I've come to a

13:07.856 --> 13:11.392
very difficult decision.
The EBDB's very sensitive data

13:11.560 --> 13:15.196
has been compromised by the
Chinese, so, I've decided to

13:15.314 --> 13:18.532
inform all of my clients that
their private information has

13:18.650 --> 13:22.737
been exposed.
So, Pete, the world may find out

13:22.904 --> 13:28.459
that you are Eskimo brothers, through
Gina Gibiatti, with Sisqo. Who?

13:28.577 --> 13:30.461
"Thong Song."
Yeah!

13:30.579 --> 13:32.380
No!
And Kevin, through your

13:32.497 --> 13:37.918
joyless humping with Jenny last week,
you are now connected to Rafi. What?

13:38.053 --> 13:39.920
He was watching through the
window while masturbating.

13:40.088 --> 13:42.139
Ew. Aw. Aw.
Oh, my God.

13:42.257 --> 13:44.392
And Jenny, the world may find
out that you and I are Eskimo

13:44.509 --> 13:46.394
sisters.
Excuse me.

13:46.511 --> 13:50.398
Yeah, I slept with a girl that Jenny
slept with in college. What?!

13:50.515 --> 13:52.400
Ooh.
Becky.

13:52.517 --> 13:54.402
Oh.
Mm.

13:54.519 --> 13:56.354
Oh!
Okay, wait.

13:56.488 --> 13:58.356
Should we get Ellie?
She might have something to say.

13:58.490 --> 14:00.191
Ellie? Ellie, come in here.
No. No.

14:00.325 --> 14:02.193
No, no, no. No, no. No, no.
What? No?

14:02.327 --> 14:04.195
What happened?
Okay, my field hockey team--

14:04.329 --> 14:06.497
we were on the road, our bus
broke down, they put us up at a

14:06.615 --> 14:09.033
janky Days Inn, they stuck us
two in a room, and Becky

14:09.167 --> 14:12.169
and I...
This is like a Cinemax movie.

14:12.287 --> 14:14.005
Hold on, I've got to get
Ruxin on Facetime. He's...

14:14.122 --> 14:15.873
No.
No, no, no, he already knows.

14:16.008 --> 14:17.842
I e-mailed him.
What? No, no. I...

14:17.959 --> 14:21.462
I cannot believe this! No!
It was like a team

14:21.596 --> 14:24.298
trust-building exercise.
Come on!

14:24.433 --> 14:27.218
Guys, I'm so sorry this
information has leaked.

14:27.352 --> 14:29.513
Wish there was something I could
have done to avoid it.

14:29.521 --> 14:31.639
Are you kidding me?!
Yeah. I'm...

14:31.807 --> 14:33.608
Are you kidding me?
In front of everybody over

14:33.642 --> 14:35.309
there, I have to find this out?!
It's kind of hot.

14:35.477 --> 14:37.812
No more secrets, okay?

14:37.979 --> 14:41.899
Okay, no more secrets.
God.

14:42.034 --> 14:45.653
No more secrets.

14:45.821 --> 14:49.874
Okay.
What? Is it bad?

14:49.991 --> 14:55.079
It's not great. All right, so, who's my
Eskimo brother or sister? You're good.

14:55.213 --> 14:56.831
What do you mean I'm good?
I'm good?

14:56.998 --> 15:00.501
You're good. Check out, like, a really
embarrassing one, like, John Tesh?

15:00.669 --> 15:04.171
No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled
at you. It's just, I've had a really

15:04.339 --> 15:06.059
shitty day.
Just shit after shit after shit!

15:06.141 --> 15:07.842
It's a real shitty day for you.

15:07.976 --> 15:09.677
Or, like, somebody from, uh,
2 Live Crew.

15:09.811 --> 15:11.512
No.
This feels great, though.

15:11.646 --> 15:13.514
Ow!
Ellie?

15:13.648 --> 15:15.516
Oh, my God.
Ow! Ow!

15:15.650 --> 15:17.234
Are you okay?
Are you okay? What?

15:17.352 --> 15:19.070
Yeah, the stupid idol fell on
my head.

15:19.187 --> 15:21.072
Oh, honey.
Okay, baby, here, put this on

15:21.189 --> 15:22.907
your head, go ahead.
Ah, no. You know, let me get

15:23.024 --> 15:26.544
you a Boo-Boo Kitty.
No, this is fine.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.549
Yeah, leave that on there.
Okay, you know what?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.551
Shiva's gonna go in the garage.
Just until this phase passes.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.553
Yeah, let's put the Sacko in
there for consistency, too.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.555
Uh, no.
Nope.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.557
Not happening.
No way.

15:36.674 --> 15:37.803
You know what, babe?
I think you're good.

15:37.923 --> 15:39.203
No, no, no, got to leave this
on.

15:39.295 --> 15:41.296
Ice helps with the swelling.
Ew!

15:43.000 --> 15:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:50.448 --> 15:52.244
I, uh, I kind of love football.

15:52.364 --> 15:54.127
We should totally watch
football together.

15:54.497 --> 15:56.667
Um... okay.
Yeah.

16:00.002 --> 16:04.756
Aah! God... What do you think? Wow, I l...
I love it, I wish

16:04.874 --> 16:07.876
it was a little less.
Oh, like a little less?

16:08.044 --> 16:10.379
Still less, I think.
What about nothing?

16:10.513 --> 16:12.714
Nothing's good.
Very good.

16:12.849 --> 16:16.385
Can't tell with these two
hats-- do I want to get laid

16:16.519 --> 16:21.640
or do I want to get paid.
Is there another option?

16:21.774 --> 16:24.893
Both. But you made all this from scratch?
I learned to cook in

16:25.027 --> 16:30.031
Provence. Well, I learned to
eat in Chicago. Bon appétit.

16:30.149 --> 16:33.151
Oh, my God, that's good.
Wait 16 minutes.

16:33.286 --> 16:35.153
All right, I'm not waiting
16 minutes, no, no.

16:35.288 --> 16:41.410
No, but, but... It's not hummus with
chickpeas, it's hummus with... Oh, wow.

16:41.544 --> 16:43.578
Salmon roe.
Now, take this in.

16:43.746 --> 16:45.580
It's crab bladder...

16:45.748 --> 16:47.082
...and algae.
No, no, no, no.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.168
The gagging's normal-- you're
supposed to taste it twice.

16:50.303 --> 16:59.678
Ooh. Shiva, give me guidance, please.

16:59.812 --> 17:02.564
Hey, I was just thinking about
you.

17:02.682 --> 17:04.766
Aw! I was thinking about you,
too.

17:04.934 --> 17:08.436
So I got off early.
<i>Voulez-vous manger avec moi?</i>

17:08.570 --> 17:13.909
Sure. Well, just think about what you
want to do. Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

17:14.026 --> 17:15.911
Pick him up, you got him.
Aw, yeah.

17:16.028 --> 17:17.445
What?
Yeah!

17:17.579 --> 17:19.579
Dude, play some defense.
The guy is a lunatic, man.

17:19.582 --> 17:21.333
He fouls all the time.
Leave me alone.

17:21.451 --> 17:22.917
Man up.
Fine.

17:23.035 --> 17:24.920
Pick him up, go.

17:25.037 --> 17:26.454
Oh!
Foul, foul.

17:26.622 --> 17:28.123
What is wrong with you?
Hey, hey, it was an accident,

17:28.257 --> 17:31.676
okay? You've been playing like that
the whole time. I'm a man of God.

17:31.794 --> 17:33.678
All right, you... I-I'm
sorry, you're right, Father.

17:33.796 --> 17:36.965
Um, I have an ice pack, I will
get it for you.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.935
A little warm, but it should
work.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.937
I'm sorry, Father, I...

17:42.054 --> 17:43.438
Got to watch those elbows--
it's crazy.

17:43.556 --> 17:45.140
My emotions got the best of me.

17:45.308 --> 17:48.143
Are you okay? It's okay, it's
fine, it's fine, I'm fine. Okay.

17:52.615 --> 17:56.067
Oh, my God.
What is this?

17:56.202 --> 17:58.653
What...?
Oh I... I think that's shit.

17:58.788 --> 18:00.655
This is shit?
Oh... Excrement, e-excrement.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.657
You threw a bag of shit at me?

18:02.792 --> 18:04.659
No, no, no, no, that's not my
shit-- I don't know whose shit

18:04.794 --> 18:06.628
that is.
Father, I am so sorry.

18:06.746 --> 18:09.381
I-I... I will never miss Mass
again.

18:09.499 --> 18:12.167
Is this a sin?
Yes, yes, it's a sin.

18:12.335 --> 18:13.969
"Throw shit into a priest's
face" is a big sin!

18:14.086 --> 18:16.505
Ugh.
I never read the Bible.

18:40.613 --> 18:43.698
Hey, it's that guy again.
I want my data back, you

18:43.833 --> 18:46.001
cyberterrorists.
I want my food back.

18:46.118 --> 18:49.671
Never.

18:49.789 --> 18:57.546
There's no free food here. It's not a
homeless shelter, you bad boy! Go there.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.798
The database!

18:59.932 --> 19:04.803
Ha-ha! Yes, my Eskimo brothers are safe.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.972
Oh.
I don't know.

19:07.106 --> 19:13.445
The punk-- he vanished. Guess I'm
gonna be in here for a while. Ooh.

19:13.563 --> 19:17.315
Dumpster Ding Dong.
Best day ever.

19:19.738 --> 19:22.106
So in your mind, the right
move was to take a frozen

19:22.274 --> 19:25.287
poo-poo kitty and put it on your
priest's face?

19:25.407 --> 19:27.291
It was more like a boo-boo
shitty.

19:27.409 --> 19:29.710
Enough. You're embarrassed
by your crapsicles? Stop.

19:29.828 --> 19:30.744
Right.
Shit pops.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.465
Stop. Guys... does this
say "professional?" No.

19:34.582 --> 19:35.966
No.
You're right-- this does.

19:36.084 --> 19:37.918
That's the one.
Where is Taco?

19:38.053 --> 19:39.553
He should be home with Ellie
by now.

19:39.671 --> 19:41.338
I don't know.
<i>Bonjour, mes amis.</i>

19:41.473 --> 19:42.840
Hey, Penny.
Hi.

19:42.974 --> 19:47.094
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
Milady is ready for her

19:47.228 --> 19:53.100
close-up. Come, Milady, come, come,
Milady-- here he is.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.737
Oh, wow.
Wow.

19:56.855 --> 20:00.691
What did... What did you do?
What did you do?

20:00.825 --> 20:02.826
Did you tattoo her?
Yeah, that... I thought

20:02.944 --> 20:04.862
that's what you wanted.
You nailed it.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.997
That's some cattitude.
Why would you do this?

20:07.115 --> 20:08.999
I'm so confused right now.
Here's something you won't be

20:09.117 --> 20:11.785
confused about: I'm a master
reviewer on Yelp, and no one

20:11.920 --> 20:13.837
will be soliciting your business
anytime soon.

20:13.955 --> 20:15.839
I didn't get that gold star for
nothing.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.959
Milady, Milady!
Wow.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.094
Okay, I-I am so sorry.
I thought this is what Andre

20:21.129 --> 20:23.714
wanted.
Look, you're a great girl,

20:23.848 --> 20:28.102
but this was a phenomenal prank.
Wait,<i> je suis très confuse.</i>

20:28.219 --> 20:30.854
You... Are you saying that you
chose a prank over me?

20:30.972 --> 20:33.390
Sometimes you come to a spork
in the road.

20:33.525 --> 20:37.027
<i>Tatanard!</i> I don't think that means
anything. Yeah, well, you know what

20:37.145 --> 20:38.312
this means.
Whoa.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.314
Au revoir.
Au revoir, you dick!

20:40.448 --> 20:42.448
You're my hero, buddy.
All right, I got to get some

20:42.450 --> 20:44.151
pictures of that cat.
Get it.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.153
Oh, I, uh...
Hey.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.327
Fa-Father Muldoon! Wow!
I had to drive your daughter

20:48.456 --> 20:51.125
home because her uncle neglected
to pick her up.

20:51.242 --> 20:53.460
I... I-I apologize.
My brother Taco can be a little

20:53.578 --> 20:56.130
bit flaky.
You also broke your promise

20:56.247 --> 20:58.382
about coming to Mass, Kevin.
I-I was a little nervous

20:58.500 --> 21:00.751
that you were gonna try to get
me back by replacing the

21:00.885 --> 21:03.721
communion wafer with, uh...
you know, stuff?

21:03.838 --> 21:06.173
You know I can't lie to your
daughter, if she asks if her

21:06.341 --> 21:08.675
parents are going to Hell.
We're not going to Hell.

21:08.843 --> 21:11.178
No.
We're law-abiding Catholics.

21:11.346 --> 21:17.351
Really? I... also hear that you worship
a pagan idol called "Shiva"? They do!

21:17.519 --> 21:20.020
No, we are in a fantasy
football league, and the

21:20.155 --> 21:21.855
trophy's called the Shiva.
You know what?

21:21.990 --> 21:23.524
Let me just show it to you.
It's right over here.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.192
It's so innocent.
Come see.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.321
The trophy's right in here.
Right this way, Father.

21:26.441 --> 21:28.329
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

21:28.449 --> 21:30.362
Taco, you were supposed to
pick up Ellie.

21:30.450 --> 21:33.357
Well, I couldn't because the
goddamn Chinese were chasing me.

21:33.477 --> 21:37.181
But I got away, and guess what I
found... ♪ Ta-da! ♪

21:37.301 --> 21:39.719
Now no one's ever gonna find out

21:39.853 --> 21:42.638
that you let a homeless person
jerk off to you having sex!

21:42.773 --> 21:45.525
No, no!
Jenny, don't worry, no one's

21:45.642 --> 21:47.642
going to know that you had sex
with another woman--

21:47.644 --> 21:49.612
No, Taco!
Your secrets are safe!

21:49.730 --> 21:51.731
Jesus Christ, that was close!
Taco!

21:51.865 --> 21:54.400
Father, I'm so sorry.
The completely innocent trophy

21:54.535 --> 21:56.452
that we're looking for is in the
cabinet.

21:56.570 --> 21:59.155
Just... please.
Hmm?

21:59.289 --> 22:01.040
Aah! Dear God!

22:01.158 --> 22:02.992
Oh, my God!

22:03.127 --> 22:04.577
Pull the cat off!
No, cat...!

22:08.465 --> 22:10.883
Oh, no...
Are you okay?

22:11.001 --> 22:13.052
You're going to Hell!
All of you!

22:13.170 --> 22:16.639
You're going to Hell!
I try to tell them.

22:16.757 --> 22:20.676
You're all fornicators!
Fornicators!

22:20.811 --> 22:25.898
Not every day. That cat scratched the
shit out of Father Muldoon. For real.

22:26.016 --> 22:27.850
Usually the pussy's only
furious at Andre.
