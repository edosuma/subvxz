00:14.114 --> 00:16.347
            Really?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.683
            [sighs]

00:17.685 --> 00:20.386
            - Erin?

00:20.388 --> 00:22.521
       - Hey, stephanie.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.458
     - It's lancaster now.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.760
       - Congratulations.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.228
     - You need some help?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.596
             - No.
            Thanks.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.098
  I've been meaning to upgrade
          my luggage.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.534
    - You know, we were all
    just talking about you.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.169
            - Yeah?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.238
   - We didn't see your name
on the reunion page on facebook.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.507
     - Uh, yeah, you know,
          I saw that,

00:41.509 --> 00:44.376
       But I have a thing
  that I have to get to, so...

00:44.378 --> 00:48.180
     - So are you working?
   What--what are you up to?

00:48.182 --> 00:50.249
        - Uh, I'm a cop.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.585
          - Seriously?

00:53.587 --> 00:56.121
    - Seriously, I'm a cop.

00:56.123 --> 01:00.459
       I would've thought
  you'd be running from them.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.529
            - Nope.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.129
  - Well, come to the reunion.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.832
       And don't worry--
   there are plenty of girls

01:06.834 --> 01:08.500
      Who are still single
          who rsvp'd.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.269
  I think a big group of them

01:10.271 --> 01:11.804
  Are renting a stretch hummer
         or something.

01:11.806 --> 01:15.541
         Oh, and, plus,
    you might meet someone.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.377
       But, hey, if not,
         I understand.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.412

         The graveyard.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.176
            - Well,
  it looks like you picked up

01:51.178 --> 01:53.278
  Some discipline inside, huh?

01:54.881 --> 01:57.282
             - Yep.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.285
           Picked up
     a lot of things, pop.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.623
  - Justin, I know you're not
 loving this c.T.A. Gig, okay?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.126
      It's only temporary.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.261
    I just want to make sure
you don't fall into bad habits,

02:09.263 --> 02:10.863
         Start running
     with a crowd that'll--

02:10.865 --> 02:13.465
       - I love you, dad.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.838
   - Is everything all right?

02:22.275 --> 02:25.711
    - What, I can't tell you
   that I love you sometimes?

02:25.713 --> 02:28.780
     [cell phone vibrating]

02:34.721 --> 02:37.322
           - Voight.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.202
   - All right, thanks, guys.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.309
        - Don't tell me.
            - Yeah.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.678
           Her name's
      charlotte matthews.

02:59.680 --> 03:04.316
       Everything matches
 from the victim two days ago.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.617
          - Commander.
          - Commander.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.486
            - Raped?
            - Yeah.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.520
     - And ear was cut off?

03:08.522 --> 03:09.621
        - That's right.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.292
   In new york six months ago
      similar to our two.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.360
     We've been in contact
   with the detectives there.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.434
  - Now, there are 600 reasons

03:22.436 --> 03:24.770
     Why I didn't want you
    in charge of this unit,

03:24.772 --> 03:27.272
  But there's one main reason
          why I did--

03:27.274 --> 03:29.241
        Cases like this.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.277
       You understand me?

03:32.279 --> 03:34.313
            - I do.

03:42.322 --> 03:45.457
  - Let me talk to my partner,
   and I'll get back to you.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.326
      All right, sergeant.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.728
     Hey, you know the perp
     that raped and killed

03:49.730 --> 03:51.363
            And cut
     the victim's ear off?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.631
      He just struck again
         two hours ago

03:52.633 --> 03:54.299
    In chicago's riverwalk.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.634
      - Well, I sent them
  all the files from our case

03:55.636 --> 03:56.835
 When their first one happened.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.937
I don't know what more we can do
          on our end.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.339
          - Not much.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.507
           That's why
   we're heading to chicago.

04:12.485 --> 04:12.718
               .

04:12.720 --> 04:15.320
          - What's up?
       - Morning, sarge.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.389
     - Erin, good morning.

 - Have you noticed that platt,
like, loves you for some reason?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.726
      - Do you own a suit?
          - Yeah, why?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.729
     - You're going with me
   to my high-school reunion.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.765
      Also, we're engaged.
      [door buzzer sounds]

04:26.767 --> 04:27.966
           - W-wait.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.606
      - You're still here?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.742
            - Yeah.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.777
      I plan on being here
          for a while.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.712
            - Yeah?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.314
     Doing what, with whom?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.916
         - Look, al...

04:46.886 --> 04:49.755
   I'm telling you right now,
          man-to-man,

04:49.757 --> 04:52.491
     I'm ready to do my job
         the right way,

04:52.493 --> 04:55.494
           Your way.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.862
   Okay, so what do you say--

04:56.864 --> 05:00.932
            New day,
    new beginnings, please?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.702
     Look, I know I can be
a little overzealous, all right?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.838
 Growing up in the neighborhood
         I grew up in--

05:06.840 --> 05:09.908
         - I don't need
     your life story, man.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.877
        I just need you
        to listen to me.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.945
            - Yeah.
             Yeah.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.549
      - Only when I think
   you're gonna make it here,

05:17.551 --> 05:19.384
    And then you can tell me

05:19.386 --> 05:23.855
      All about how daddy
 never bought you a skateboard.

05:28.761 --> 05:29.761
      - You speak italian?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.731
      - [speaking italian]

05:32.733 --> 05:35.600
   - Where'd you pick it up?
 - I was stationed in vicenza.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.935
         - You served?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.037
       - Yeah, a.B.C.T.,
 part of a rapid response team.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.073
    It's about an hour away
         from everyone.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.074
              You?

05:42.076 --> 05:45.677
          - Rangers--
          afghanistan.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.112
  - Well, that explains a lot.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.914
    - Were you ever injured
in the line of crushing grapes?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.782
          - Excuse me?
  - Was that in world war ii?

05:50.784 --> 05:54.419
   - I can't hear you. What?
         - Oh, my god.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.092
       These poor girls.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.100
     - Media's calling him
    "the riverwalk killer."

06:08.102 --> 06:09.935
      Mayor's flipping out
     on the superintendent,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.770
       Who's flipping out
         on the chief.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.706
  None of that matters to me.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.844
 And were put through something
         so horrific...

06:22.882 --> 06:24.416
  It ain't gonna happen again.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.917
    - There's no witnesses.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.919
     Area central searched
       every crime scene

06:27.921 --> 06:29.855
       And came up blank
     on physical evidence.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.790
            - Pods?
            - Zero.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.158
          - Detectives

    In new york are en route
     right now to help out.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.695
        - They also had
       two victims killed

06:36.697 --> 06:38.897
 In their city two days apart,

06:38.899 --> 06:41.400
      And traffic cameras
 picked up a male, white, 5'10"

06:41.402 --> 06:42.801
        Wearing a hoodie
    following both victims,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.836
     But they couldn't get
  a clear visual on his face.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.405
          - What about
   registered sex offenders?

06:46.407 --> 06:47.506
        - Nothing pops.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.508
        Plus, no dna yet
    off any of the victims.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.743
- Hey, we're not waiting around
           for that.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.079
       We get proactive.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.580
      Boots on the ground.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.048
        I want everyone
       working the river

06:57.050 --> 06:58.717

06:58.719 --> 07:00.786
        Dress the part.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.726
   - Burgess, I need a favor.

07:07.728 --> 07:12.798
We're gonna need someone to man
  the phones in intelligence.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.767
   So there's gonna be a lot
      of calls coming in.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.769
    - Yeah, I'm all over it.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.475
       - Congratulations.
      You made secretary.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.143
   - Don't hate, appreciate.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.778
            - Well,
   there's some fresh slang.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.450
       - I'll be upstairs
        if you need me.

08:05.218 --> 08:09.254
          - [panting]

08:09.256 --> 08:11.556
         - Oh, my god,
 whoever is panting in the mic,

08:11.558 --> 08:12.858
       You're killing me
           right now.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.760
       - Bite me, ruzek.
 I've been running for an hour.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.239
 - Can I start calling you hank
           or voight?

08:27.241 --> 08:28.874
             - No.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.576
       - Well, you know,
I'm reading this book right now.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.879
          It's called
   <i> the magic of thinking big,</i>

08:33.881 --> 08:35.947
   Wherein the author posits
     that titles, you know,

08:35.948 --> 08:38.283
  They just cause this formal

08:38.284 --> 08:41.886
   And unnecessary separation
        between people.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.026
     - Can we do any better
         on this image?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.031
      - I'm working on it.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.237
          - All right,
    everyone check the ramp.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.107
       - Eyes on a male--
      white, brown hoodie.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.174
         - In pursuit.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.685
             - Hey!

09:13.687 --> 09:15.787
           - Police!
          Let her go!

09:17.857 --> 09:20.091
            Hold on!

09:20.093 --> 09:22.861
        Ma'am, you okay?

09:30.636 --> 09:31.836
         - Don't move!

09:31.838 --> 09:34.072
      I'm gonna crack you!
          You hear me?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.206
       Give me your hand.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.109
           - [groans]

09:38.111 --> 09:40.011
     - Offender in custody.

09:44.050 --> 09:44.282
               .

09:44.284 --> 09:47.252
      [indistinct chatter]

09:47.254 --> 09:50.021
        - Theo mitchell,
and I don't think he's our guy.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.259
      - Found four wallets
   and three watches on him.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.961
       He's a pickpocket,
       a purse-snatcher.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.996
    Four arrests in the last
  ten years along those lines.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.032
      No rape, no murder,
   not even a sexual assault.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.000
            - What?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.969
      - What do you think?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.639
     - Let's bring him in.

10:07.641 --> 10:11.009
      - Come on. Come on.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.644
         Get in there.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.985
   - This is a railroad, man.
         Unbelievable.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.354
       I would never hurt
        a woman, never.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.689
 - I'm inclined to believe you.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.358
      - Then what the hell
        am I doing here

10:26.360 --> 10:27.892
   Getting looked at for it?

10:27.894 --> 10:31.029
    - Riverwalk's your turf
   for pulling crimes, right?

10:31.031 --> 10:34.065
  Looks like you've had pretty
  fertile grounds for a while.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.901
        - Oh, oh, okay,
           I get it.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.837
 Threaten me with rape, murder,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.405
       And then admitting
    to boosting some wallets

10:40.407 --> 10:42.107
   Seems tame by comparison.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.976
         You know what?
        I'm out of here.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.311
       - No, you're not.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.947
        Sizing people up
   and then ripping them off,

10:48.949 --> 10:51.116
       I'm thinking maybe
     you could help us find

10:51.118 --> 10:55.020
     Who did rape and kill
       those two girls...

10:55.022 --> 10:57.389
    Because my experience--

10:57.391 --> 11:00.392
     A cheetah always knows
      where the hyena is.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.832
     - I like that analogy.
     You went jungle on me.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.370
     - Early this morning,
       before 6:00 a.M.,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.339
       Around east lake--

11:14.341 --> 11:16.274
   Close your eyes and think.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.243
           - [sighs]

11:23.382 --> 11:26.351
     There was this dude...

11:26.353 --> 11:29.287
       Like, 5:00 a.M....

11:29.289 --> 11:31.022
        In running gear,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.857
   But he was just stretching
        the whole time,

11:32.859 --> 11:35.160
      Just looking around.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.828
      I remember thinking

11:36.830 --> 11:38.430
    He was either a criminal
           or a cop,

11:38.432 --> 11:41.366
  But I ain't ever seen a cop
with a watch that nice, though.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.736
           - [scoffs]
 how close did you get to him?

11:44.738 --> 11:47.739
         - Real close.
     I walked right by him.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.120
      - What's up, office?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.955
   That's what you guys call
  each other out here, right--

12:03.957 --> 12:06.791
           "office"?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.993
       - Sergeant platt.
      How can I help you?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.296
   - Yeah, we're here to see
sergeant voight in intelligence.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.299
   - We have some information
       to share with him.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.000
          - Regarding?

12:16.002 --> 12:18.903
 - We're detectives from nypd.
Sergeant voight is expecting us.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.472
         - Oh, my god,
      you should have said

12:20.474 --> 12:21.940
  You were from new york city.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.042
         I'm mortified.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.945
     Why don't you park it
          over there?

12:30.282 --> 12:32.317
     - Hey, office burgess,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.953
 Would you get your skinny ass
           down here?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.488
           [laughing]
           "office."

12:39.391 --> 12:42.460
 - Hey, appreciate you coming.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.862
          - Of course.
         - Hank voight.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.164
     - Hey, there. Rollins.
              Hi.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.800
  - All right, how you doing?
       - How's it going?

12:48.802 --> 12:49.868
            - Okay.
             - Jay.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.102
      - You guys are nice.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.338
 What's up with that battle-ax
          downstairs?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.939
   - There isn't enough time
          in the day.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.841
           Pleasure.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.843
      - Start off looking
    for patterns, obviously.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.246
          Why new york
        and now chicago?

13:01.248 --> 13:04.048
     And this just happens
        to be his route?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.550
  Maybe an interstate trucker?
            - Yeah.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.318
      The only commonality
       that we could find

13:07.320 --> 13:08.853
 That might be worth pursuing,

13:08.855 --> 13:11.322
  Is there was a manufacturing
     trade show convention

13:11.324 --> 13:14.192
    In new york at the time
      of our rape-murders.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.095
    Now, that convention is
        now here in town

13:17.097 --> 13:18.396
    At the rittenton center?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.964
      - Rittenhouse, yeah.
            - Yeah.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.366
             - Jin.
         - Yeah, on it.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.302
     - So who is this guy?
I mean, what are we looking for?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.372
 - This perp has been elevated
    to serial-killer status.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.374
        I mean, in terms
    of the rape and murder,

13:29.376 --> 13:31.576
    There are five different
        profile psyches.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.046
     I think we're looking
at an anger retaliatory rapist.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.449
       I mean, I get that
 he's a sadistic son of a bitch

13:38.451 --> 13:40.451
        And everything,
 but is he trying to establish

13:40.453 --> 13:41.886
    Some sort of cred or...?

13:41.888 --> 13:44.889
    - Usually as a souvenir
          or a trophy.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.357
           Sometimes
    they even make shrines.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.861
           - [groans]
            - yuck.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.896
           - How long
     we have you guys for?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.198
     - As long as you need.

13:59.072 --> 14:03.374
  Yo, our monitor works better
  if you don't slobber on it.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.311
        - Hey, how about
    that detective rollins?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.246
  She's got, like, ten things
           going on,

14:08.248 --> 14:09.981
       All of them good,
          am I right?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.349
            - Yeah.
I give your marriage six months.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.051
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.285
         Wendy and I--
     we're cool like that.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.288
       And could tell her
 exactly what I just told you.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.224
        - [laughs] yeah?
            - Yeah.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.059
    - You'd tell your fiance
        that you worked

14:21.061 --> 14:22.327
      With a hot detective
         from new york

14:22.329 --> 14:25.563
  That kind of blew your mind?

14:25.565 --> 14:26.564
             - No.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.133
             - No.
             - No.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.870
          - Come here.
          - All right.

14:31.872 --> 14:36.174
    - Okay, here's a list of
 attendees to both conferences,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.109
   And I managed to put them
    through the dmv database

14:38.111 --> 14:39.310
      And pull the photos.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.045
  - Jin, I don't need to hear
        about the labor.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.015
     Just show me the baby.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.250
            - There.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.987
         I got 45 guys
 who went to both conferences.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.555
          - All right.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.492
            - Wait.
            Hold up.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.428
         - Whoa, whoa.
     Don't touch the keys.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.898
           - No. No.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.332
    Look, how many of these
       I got to look at?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.101
    - Don't worry about it.
       Just keep looking.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.602
  - I mean, like, 100 or 200,
            'cause--

15:04.604 --> 15:07.405
       Whoa, whoa, whoa.
        That's the dude.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.275
        I swear to god.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.915
       - Fyi, you're not
        just my fiance.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.383
        You're my fiance
 that got in early at facebook,

15:18.385 --> 15:19.484
        Like, way early.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.486
          You're worth
     at least $10 million.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.421
 - Well, how about I get a perm
      and I wear a hoodie,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.189
And you can just tell everybody
      I'm mark zuckerberg?

15:25.191 --> 15:26.491
          - The reason
     I don't wear a ring--

15:26.493 --> 15:27.926
    - Why can't I be a cop?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.461
- What does your suit look like?
         - Like a suit.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.963
   - It has to look high end.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.598
      - I have nice suits.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.502
          [door opens,
      indistinct chatter]

15:41.473 --> 15:44.375
            - There.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.477
         Jeffrey baker?
             - Yes?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.613
      - Detectives lindsay
   and halstead, chicago p.D.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.249
   - Apparently, there's been
some damage to your hotel room.

15:51.251 --> 15:55.386
 Would you mind coming with us
       to talk about it?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.455
    - I didn't do any damage
       to my hotel room.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.491
   - Great. You can clear all
 that up down at the district.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.193
           After you.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.735
         - So how long
     have you been in town?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.170
          - Five days.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.105
             - Mm.
        From st. Louis?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.741
  - You been to the riverwalk
        at all, jeffrey?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.509
        - What does that
 have to do with my hotel room?

16:18.511 --> 16:21.412
     - I'll ask you, again.
   You been to the riverwalk?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.381
           - I have.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.716
            - When?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.718
          - [chuckles]
          forgive me,

16:26.720 --> 16:28.453
           But I get
     the sneaking suspicion

16:28.455 --> 16:30.321
       That I'm not here
      about a hotel room.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.056
        - Well, why else
     would we bring you in?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.591
   - I haven't the foggiest.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.626
             - Mm.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.062
 Oh, would you like some water?

16:42.435 --> 16:46.404
     - What days and times
   were you at the riverwalk?

16:46.406 --> 16:49.374
          - Do you get
       the internet here?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.743
'cause there's this great video
           on youtube

16:51.745 --> 16:53.344
 By this law-school professor,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.046
   And he's very articulate,

16:55.048 --> 16:59.083
 And he makes a very compelling
    and convincing argument.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.152
          It's called
     "don't talk to cops."

17:02.521 --> 17:04.589
          No offense.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.694
          - [chuckles]

17:09.695 --> 17:11.496
    You're not in st. Louis,
            jeffrey.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.531
We've had two rape-murders here
      in the last few days

17:13.532 --> 17:15.066
        Where the women
        were mutilated.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.602
    Now, you're gonna answer
   some questions about that.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.705
     Wipe that stupid smile
         off your face.

17:24.576 --> 17:28.746
   - I will remove the smile,
         as requested,

17:28.748 --> 17:32.216
  And tell you very seriously
  that you have the wrong guy.

17:35.421 --> 17:40.491
 - We want the dates and times
   you were at the riverwalk.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.573
          Get writing.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.446
  - There's been another rape
     down at the riverwalk.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.747
        Victim survived.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.849
     She's at chicago med.

18:13.125 --> 18:13.357
               .

18:13.359 --> 18:16.127
         - Hi, vanessa.
             Ma'am.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.597
     I'm detective lindsay,
 and this is detective dawson,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.232
   And we're here to try to--

18:21.234 --> 18:23.301
    - I'll do whatever I can
     to help you catch him.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.773
          - All right.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.208
           Thank you.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.844
   - Can you take us through
         what happened?

18:37.416 --> 18:40.118
    - I'm on the soccer team
           at school,

18:40.120 --> 18:44.822
   So I like to get a run in
        after practice,

18:44.824 --> 18:48.292
  And I cut through riverwalk
    the way I do every day,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.394
      And out of nowhere,
        this guy appears

18:50.396 --> 18:52.296
       In a brown hoodie
        with a mask on.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.664
     - Did he say anything?

18:53.666 --> 18:58.336
       - Just to shut up
        and not scream.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.138
  He put a hand over my mouth,

19:00.140 --> 19:03.741
       And he dragged me
    to, like, this dark area

19:03.743 --> 19:05.810
     Underneath the stairs.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.883
  And then he yanked my sweats
      and underwear down,

19:11.885 --> 19:13.885
       And that's when...

19:13.887 --> 19:16.287
  That--that's when he did it.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.657
            - Okay.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.828
       Is there anything
  that you could see on him--

19:23.830 --> 19:26.764
      Scars, a birthmark?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.266
             - No.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.302
      - What about height
          and weight?

19:31.304 --> 19:35.773
 - He was about you're height,
maybe a little heavier than you.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.210
       He had brown eyes,

19:39.212 --> 19:43.314
  And I saw some of his hair.
      It was dirty blonde.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.684
     - Well, that's great.
 That's a lot more than we had.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.819
    - Is there anything else
          that you saw

19:48.821 --> 19:51.322
       That could help us
         identify him?

19:51.324 --> 19:54.926
         - When he took
        his knife out...

19:54.928 --> 19:57.261
      Something kicked in.

19:58.430 --> 20:01.432
 We just had this self-defense
        class at school,

20:01.434 --> 20:03.901
    And the instructor lady

20:03.903 --> 20:07.972
Said that if you don't remember
         anything else,

20:07.974 --> 20:10.975
     You should slap, grab,
        twist, and pull.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.947
     And that's what I did.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.416
            - Good.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.452
       I'm glad you did.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.921
    Now, when that happened,

20:23.923 --> 20:27.825
         Were you able
   to scratch his face or...?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.494
     - It got my thumbnail
        inside his eye,

20:30.496 --> 20:32.763
        His right eye...

20:32.765 --> 20:35.833
             Deep.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.904
          He screamed,
 and he fell off of me, and...

20:39.906 --> 20:41.973
     And that's when I ran.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.345
    - You have been amazing.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.016
     - He didn't break me.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.853
    I want him to know that.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.492
           - He will.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.664
    - The guy we brought in,
        jeffrey baker--

21:06.666 --> 21:08.899
  What eye color does he have?
            - Blue.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.702
  Plus, he was in our custody
    when this rape happened.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.473
     - All right, kick him.

21:15.475 --> 21:19.443
    Blonde hair, brown eyes,
  possible damage to the eye.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.778
 Check all clinics, hospitals,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.947
     See if anybody came in
       for an eye injury.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.583
- I'll get it out to all vehicle
        and foot patrol.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.720
           - [sighs]

21:29.722 --> 21:31.422
        - You all right?

21:31.424 --> 21:33.524
        - She's only 16.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.027
         Let's get him.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.905
   - Hey, I have to head out,

21:47.907 --> 21:50.374
      But if anyone asks,
   I'm on official business.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.310
         - Wait. Sorry.
      Can you repeat that?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.779
      - Yes, I have to go,
  but it's official business,

21:54.781 --> 21:56.080
   Just in case anyone asks.
           - Hold on.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.948
   I got to write this down,
    or I'm gonna forget it.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.384
    Okay, officer burgess...
            - Yeah.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.620
          - Has to go,
   but in case anyone asks--

22:02.622 --> 22:04.922
       Oh, that's right.
         Nobody cares.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.492
            - Okay.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.829
    - Okay, so, if the perp
         was rational,

22:11.831 --> 22:13.798
I mean, he'd leave town knowing
      that the heat is on,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.466
   But there's a good chance
           he's not,

22:15.468 --> 22:18.035
  So most likely he's angrier.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.971
       He's more fixated
 because his needs went unmet.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.040
 - He probably has a good idea
        that he left dna

22:23.042 --> 22:24.742
Under the victim's fingernails,

22:24.744 --> 22:26.944
 And it's only a matter of time
     before he gets I.D.'d,

22:26.946 --> 22:31.649
  So he's gonna need to strike
  soon while he has a chance.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.950
          - All right,
     hospitals and clinics,

22:32.952 --> 22:34.852
  Check with foot patrol down
         at riverwalk.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.555
  Beat the bushes on this guy.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.657
    - Hey, where's burgess?

22:39.659 --> 22:41.492
     - I haven't seen her.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.762
            - Whoa.
      - Oh, sorry. My bad.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.980
             - Hmm.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.815
  Oh, yeah, that confirms it.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.017
    Chicago cops cannot make
  a good cup of coffee either.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.686
         [both chuckle]

23:08.688 --> 23:10.020
            - Here.

23:12.924 --> 23:15.459
     Thanks for helping us
        work this case.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.595
          - Of course.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.703
       - They're tough...

23:27.439 --> 23:29.807
  Especially when the victims
           are kids,

23:29.809 --> 23:32.443
         But, you know,
   at least vanessa's alive.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.945
     - It just doesn't make
           any sense.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.947
  - So you want the good guys
            to win.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.184
     - I want the bad guys
 to get what's coming to them.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.819
   - Well, sometimes they do.

23:41.821 --> 23:45.022
    Do you believe in karma?

23:45.024 --> 23:48.993
    - I believe in payback.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.029
        - Just a little
      unsolicited advice,

23:52.031 --> 23:55.099
 Just because I've been there--

23:55.101 --> 23:57.067
           Be careful

23:57.069 --> 23:58.936
         'cause payback
      is the biggest bitch

23:58.938 --> 24:01.005
     When it consumes you.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.110
   - Here, put that in there.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.646
        [knock at door]

24:08.648 --> 24:09.880
       - Where you been?

24:09.882 --> 24:12.450
        - Well, I called
       all the pharmacies

24:12.452 --> 24:14.852
    Within a two-mile radius
     of the attempted rape

24:14.854 --> 24:17.021
       Asking if any male
with blonde hair and brown eyes

24:17.023 --> 24:19.023
            Came in
  with an apparent eye injury.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.458
The walgreen's over on superior

24:20.460 --> 24:22.026
           Said a guy
   matched that description,

24:22.028 --> 24:24.595
         Bought gauze,
     peroxide, sunglasses.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.663
  They needed to see a badge,

24:25.665 --> 24:27.164
           That's why
    I had to go down there.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.470
       - What do you got?

24:32.472 --> 24:35.506
   - He used a credit card--
          neil vance.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.941
           Jin pulled
    his credit card history.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.742
       He's been staying
    at the hotel fauntleroy

24:38.744 --> 24:40.110
       The past six days.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.946
   He also has hotel charges
          in new york

24:41.948 --> 24:43.180
        At the same time
      of the rape-murders

24:43.182 --> 24:45.216
      That happened there.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.918
         - Team effort.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.956
            But, uh,
       really, more her.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.564
  - You're going places, kid.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.976
    - Halstead and lindsay.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.944
           - Parked,
    we got eyes in the back.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.045
         - O and ruzek?

25:15.047 --> 25:17.114
            - Lobby.
   Vance is not in his room.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.949
          - Stay put.

25:22.954 --> 25:24.822
       - Mackinac island.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.657
            - What?
     - That's where we met.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.125
     I was at a leadership
          conference,

25:28.127 --> 25:32.062
    And you were picking out
 property for a summer retreat.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.664
       - Of course I was.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.199
       - It all went down
      at the grand hotel--

25:35.201 --> 25:37.668
    Fireworks, candlelight.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.970
        - This is good.
 This tells me a lot about you.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.673
      - I am adding color
         to our story.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.742
   It's just like undercover.
      The details sell it.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.677
    - Yeah, just like going
          undercover.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.178
            - What?

25:48.180 --> 25:51.315
       - It's ridiculous.
           - [scoffs]

25:51.317 --> 25:55.085
   You have no idea what kind
 of bitches these girls can be.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.790
      [indistinct chatter]

26:03.995 --> 26:05.696
   - Quit acting like a cop.

26:09.668 --> 26:12.836
- Just for the record, my dad--
  he did buy me a skateboard.

26:12.838 --> 26:17.074
   - Santa cruz, black deck,
 silver trucks, orange wheels.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.710
   I can still do a nosegrind
     down a handrail, baby.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.012
          True story.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.681
    I'm not a robot, alvin.

26:23.683 --> 26:24.915
   Love me or leave me, man.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.918
          Love me, al.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.953
    - You're a pisser, man.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.154
        I swear to god.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.590
           - Pisser--
          I like that.

26:35.694 --> 26:36.994
        - Hey, that guy
    that we, uh, brought in

26:36.996 --> 26:38.729
   From the convention center
          and kicked.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.097
     - Yeah, jeffrey baker.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.133
 - What hotel is he staying at?
           - Sofitel.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.136
      - He just walked in.
He's talking to the desk clerk.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.006
     [walkie-talkie beeps]

26:49.008 --> 26:52.209
   Jeffrey baker just walked
        into the lobby.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.845
     [walkie-talkie beeps]
          - take him.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.886
- The guy that just came up here
      and talked to you...

27:02.888 --> 27:04.855
     [elevator bell dings]

27:13.932 --> 27:16.033
      - Suspect's exiting
    through the front door.

     [engine turning over]

27:34.987 --> 27:36.320
       [car door closes]

27:36.322 --> 27:38.022
   - What are you doing here,
            jeffrey?

27:38.024 --> 27:39.857
  - I'm just out for a stroll.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.226
      - Put your hands up.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.327
   - Clerk said he was asking

27:43.329 --> 27:45.162
      What room neil vance
        was staying in.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.133
        - Where's vance?

27:50.335 --> 27:52.036
       - I want a lawyer.

28:05.150 --> 28:05.416
               .

28:05.418 --> 28:10.354
    - Some deviant chat room
          most likely.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.955
        - Baker travels
      for his conventions.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.724
  Maybe vance meets him there.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.793
      Baker's the lookout
  while vance does the crime.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.795
         - It's a dyad.

28:17.797 --> 28:21.165
       Both partners plan
 and commit the crime together,

28:21.167 --> 28:22.266
      But there is usually

28:22.268 --> 28:24.702
     A dominant-submissive
         relationship.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.104
 - Like the columbine killers,
       the d.C. Snipers,

28:27.106 --> 28:28.472
     The menendez brothers,

28:28.474 --> 28:31.141
        Those two yahoos
who blew up the boston marathon.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.878
   - Yeah, the dominant force
is psychopathic and/or sadistic.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.980
     The submissive partner
         is depressed.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.182
        He's dependent.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.384
           The leader
    is gonna be charismatic,

28:40.386 --> 28:44.321
  He's looking for a follower
         to manipulate,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.256
    While the subordinate--
        he's vulnerable.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.358
         He feels lost.
 He needs someone to lead him.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.828
    - Baker's the dominant,
          guaranteed.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.996
   - Where's baker right now?
 - He's in the interview room.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.332
     He's all lawyered up.
        - Not for long.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.468
      Put him in the cage.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.803
        - Yes, sergeant.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.371
       - What's the cage?

29:15.387 --> 29:21.091
     With some pretty sharp
   detectives from new york.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.060
            I think
    we got you figured out.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.461
        - You don't say.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.798
    - You pull the strings.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.435
           Neil vance
      does the dirty work.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.804
        - I have no idea
   what you're talking about.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.841
         - Take a walk.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.846
          Take a walk.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.264
       I like that face.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.431
         Where's vance?

30:01.433 --> 30:05.502
   Which I've been attempting
     to exercise repeated--

30:09.374 --> 30:11.008
              Ah!

30:14.078 --> 30:15.345
              Ugh!

30:16.381 --> 30:18.415
     - I can't begin to try
         to understand

30:18.417 --> 30:19.550
       What goes through
         someone's head

30:19.552 --> 30:21.518
   Who would rape and murder
            a woman,

30:21.520 --> 30:25.322
      So I got to ask you,
      why cut off the ear?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.390
  Can you explain that to me?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.025
 - No, because I have no idea--

30:28.027 --> 30:32.362
  You both get your rocks off
         on it, right?

30:32.364 --> 30:35.465
Probably have him explain to you
  in detail what it was like,

30:35.467 --> 30:38.836
     What she went through.

30:38.838 --> 30:42.606
       Instead of hearing
          about it...

30:42.608 --> 30:45.909
      How about I show you
           firsthand?

30:45.911 --> 30:47.377
      - Get away from me.
         I have rights.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.579
         I have rights!

30:48.581 --> 30:51.515
        - You have me...

30:51.517 --> 30:53.450
          You sick...

30:55.386 --> 30:57.120
         Where's vance?
             - No!

30:57.122 --> 30:58.488
     No, you can't do this!

30:58.490 --> 30:59.857
              Ah!

30:59.859 --> 31:01.291
            [crying]

31:01.293 --> 31:03.527
         - Wait a sec.
     That's the wrong ear.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.529
     You have vance cut off
    the right one, correct?

31:05.531 --> 31:07.130
   - I haven't done anything!

31:07.132 --> 31:10.000
  - You tell me where vance is
           right now,

31:10.002 --> 31:13.270
   Or they're gonna carry you
 out of here in sandwich bags.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.538
           You hear?

31:14.540 --> 31:17.074
          - Navy pier!

31:17.076 --> 31:21.378
    I'm supposed to meet him
in a half an hour at navy pier.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.080
            [groans]

31:34.993 --> 31:37.461
      [door opens, closes]

31:51.509 --> 31:52.676
         - Spread out.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.545
            Come on.

32:27.512 --> 32:29.513
          - Yeah, hi.
          How are you?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.581
             Okay.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.366
        - I got the eye.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.501
            - Ruzek?

32:51.503 --> 32:53.170
         Where are you?

33:01.612 --> 33:04.047
           - C.P.D.!
        Out of the way!

33:04.049 --> 33:07.117
        [woman screams]
    whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.418
         Come on, now.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.521
        - I'll kill her!

33:18.763 --> 33:19.196
               .

33:19.198 --> 33:26.169
   Drop the gun on the ground
       and kick it to me!

33:27.271 --> 33:30.107
          - All right.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.175
     I'm not gonna give you
         a loaded gun,

33:32.177 --> 33:34.344
   But you knew that, right?
    - Where are you, ruzek?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.279
  - What's your endgame here,
            brother?

33:36.281 --> 33:38.081
      You got no way out.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.649
   Why don't you let her go?
         Come with me.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.386
             - No!
       - We have jeffrey.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.255
        He gave you up.

33:45.257 --> 33:48.291
           - I mean,
 how do you think we found you?

33:48.293 --> 33:49.726
     What are you gonna do?
   You gonna jump on a boat?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.361
            I mean,
   you haven't hurt her yet.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.397
  We can still work this out.
           - Shut up!

33:53.399 --> 33:54.564
        - Don't do this.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.299
    - You got a backup gun!
           I know it!

33:56.301 --> 33:57.601
         Give it to me!

33:57.603 --> 34:01.271
   - See, you're smart, neil.
         You're smart.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.407
  Not even my partner, marlyn,
    knows about the backup.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.210
 - Ruzek's at the marlyn yacht.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.782
       Everybody move in.

34:11.784 --> 34:14.518
- Listen, I'm gonna make a deal
        with you, okay?

34:14.520 --> 34:17.219
        You let her go,
         I let you go.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.290
           Right now
   I just want the girl safe.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.792
      - Call s.W.A.T. In?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.761
- No, there's no time for that.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.663
     Halstead and olinsky,
      move into position.

34:34.839 --> 34:36.572
  - We're backing out of here.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.275
        The moment I see
   someone flash metal at me,

34:38.277 --> 34:42.279
- None of that needs to happen,
           all right?

34:42.281 --> 34:43.380
     We're not going there.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.786
     [walkie-talkie beeps]
      - you got the shot?

34:50.789 --> 34:53.356
         - Affirmative.
        - Light him up.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.559
           [gunshot]
             - aah!

35:00.665 --> 35:02.099
   - Hey, don't look at him.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.301
    Come here. Come with me.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.502
     Hey, what's your name?
            - Kate.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.270
       - Kate, I'm adam.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.473
       Let's sit you down
       right here, okay?

35:09.475 --> 35:10.540
         You all right?
            - Yeah.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.342
          - It's okay.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.643
   This is detective lindsay.
             - Hi.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.145
- I just want you to calm down.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.180
      She's gonna ask you
     a couple of questions.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.415
     Do you have any family
          we can call?

35:18.417 --> 35:19.616
            - Yeah.
     It's in my cell phone.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.817
     - Okay, we'll get it.

35:20.819 --> 35:21.852
   We'll get everybody here,

35:21.854 --> 35:23.220
       And we'll get you
        to the hospital.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.490
    [distant sirens wailing]

35:29.260 --> 35:31.261
     - You saw some action
when you were stationed in Italy

35:31.263 --> 35:33.130
           I take it?

35:33.132 --> 35:35.365
       - A little, yeah.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.458
         - We got him.

36:11.235 --> 36:14.371
          - [sobbing]

36:28.419 --> 36:31.955
- You have fun answering phones
        up there today?

36:33.591 --> 36:35.892
 - Have a good night, sergeant.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.765
  - All right, there you go--

36:41.767 --> 36:43.400
     Macallan on the rocks.
           - Thanks.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.335
  - Where you two from, again?

36:45.337 --> 36:46.937
       - Cops from n.Y.C.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.773
 - Well, you know, even though
  firefighters own this place,

36:49.775 --> 36:53.276
 - Quit beating around the bush
  and give me something here.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.312
       - It's classified.
       - It's classified.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.314
       - It's classified.
  - You got to be kidding me.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.282
    You see what I deal with
           every day?

36:59.284 --> 37:00.483
       - Where's voight?

37:00.485 --> 37:02.285
           - Voight?
Voight doesn't come to this bar.

37:02.287 --> 37:03.820
           - Why not?
      - It's a long story.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.555
         - Classified.
    - It's classified, yeah.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.890
           [laughter]

37:06.892 --> 37:08.925
          - Well said.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.327
        - You did good.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.328
       - I'll take that.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.230
        - You did good.
         You did good.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.564
     - I'll take that, man.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.999
        I'll take that.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.601
        - You know what?
         Everybody did.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.802
            Really.
            Cheers.

37:18.804 --> 37:23.873
       - Hey, one second.
    Hey, burgess? Come here.

37:23.875 --> 37:27.677
  Antonio wanted to make sure
  we took care of you tonight.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.713
           Saddle up.
           - Thanks.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.814
         - To the blue.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.350
              All:
          To the blue.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.452
           - Cheers.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.321
       - And, of course,
       now it's raining.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.423
     - Hold on. The ring--
you never talked about the ring.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.858
     Why don't you wear it?
        - I'll wing it.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.727
    - I'm not gonna be able
  to keep this stuff straight.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.862
  Did we meet before or after
 I got stupid rich on facebook?

37:45.864 --> 37:48.932
  [women screaming excitedly]

38:02.513 --> 38:05.749
    - What am I doing here?

38:06.951 --> 38:08.585
 So, like you saw in the file,

38:08.587 --> 38:11.288
   I had been voight's c.I.,
         so he knew me,

38:11.290 --> 38:14.391
       And when I was 16,
  him and his wife took me in.

38:14.393 --> 38:17.961
         They saved me.

38:17.963 --> 38:21.998
And then he pulled some strings
 and got me into st. Ignatius,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.435
     And when I got there,
   I just made up who I was--

38:25.437 --> 38:27.003
      Voight's goddaughter
        staying with him

38:27.005 --> 38:30.640
        While my parents
        were traveling.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.475
  - So you've always been good
         at undercover?

38:32.477 --> 38:35.378
           - [laughs]
    if you mean lying, yeah.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.849
      I was a street kid.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.788
            [laughs]

38:44.790 --> 38:47.724
     So steph and her crew
  pulled me into their clique,

38:47.726 --> 38:52.028
    And pretty soon we were
  doing everything together--

38:52.030 --> 38:55.365
   Shopping, parties, and...
           All of it.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.802
            [sighs]

38:58.804 --> 39:01.538
  And then somebody found out
       who I really was.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.642
    You figure out who your
 real friends are pretty quick

39:05.644 --> 39:07.444
      When the word's out
    that your mom's a junkie

39:07.446 --> 39:09.012
    And your dad's in jail.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.416
          - Whose ass
      did you kick first?

39:13.418 --> 39:14.784
          - [chuckles]

39:14.786 --> 39:16.886
   Voight had to make a deal

39:16.888 --> 39:19.089
With the director of the school
         to get me in.

39:19.091 --> 39:23.693
      If I got in a fight
   and threw even one punch,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.795
           I was out.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.897
          So I ate it.

39:30.801 --> 39:32.869
    And it still bothers me.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.472
       I don't know why.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.140
  Even after days like today,

39:37.142 --> 39:40.877
When you would think everything
 would be put in perspective...

39:42.646 --> 39:44.881
         I don't know.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.533
           We can't.

40:05.636 --> 40:07.537
 - Come on, let's get you home.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.709
           - [sighs]

40:16.814 --> 40:18.047
         Maybe one day.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.984
       - Oh, definitely.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.137
 - Hey, justin, it's me again.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.707
     Wondering if you want
     to catch a late bite.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.179
   All right, give me a call.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.990
        [knock at door]

41:00.992 --> 41:03.226
          - [chuckles]

41:07.131 --> 41:08.665
              Hey.
             - Hey.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.135
      [breathing heavily]

41:12.137 --> 41:13.970
        - Are you okay?
            - Um...

41:13.972 --> 41:15.138
        - What's wrong?
