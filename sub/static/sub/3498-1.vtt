18:41.187 --> 18:48.326
We Geneti-Sharp have been able to help
over of a quarter of a million burn victims

18:48.328 --> 18:55.133
recover and go on to live
healthy normal lives.

[Audience: Gasp]

19:00.573 --> 19:08.746
[Clapping]

19:08.748 --> 19:12.917
So, What does all this have to
do with today?

19:12.919 --> 19:17.922
And what can it possible have to
do with dinosaurs?

19:26.165 --> 19:35.072
[Whispers among audience]

19:47.186 --> 19:49.287
The museum is gonna make a
fortune.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.089
Activate the sonic guide
beacons.

19:52.091 --> 19:57.595
Let's see if this Marvel of modern sound
technology works with a crowd around.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.931
Let's send out curly.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.873
[Audience]
Wow.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.955
Meet the dinosaurs.

20:24.323 --> 20:30.261
Fierce. Ferocious and back from
the dead for real.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.465
Here for you to see. First.

20:34.866 --> 20:38.369
Our techniques have become so
sophisticated that we can now

20:38.371 --> 20:45.409
regenerate living flesh from
a single sample of DNA.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.613
Keep the high frequency beacons
on auto.

20:49.014 --> 20:53.451
Our patent silent guide
technology allows us

20:53.453 --> 20:59.390
to control the uncontrollable.
To bend their sense of direction

20:59.392 --> 21:01.626
To our every care.

21:02.527 --> 21:12.903
[Applause]

21:12.905 --> 21:19.410
It's better then a closed movie,
Theme Park. We are finally able

21:19.412 --> 21:23.147
to have dinosaurs. Real
dinosaurs.

21:23.382 --> 21:29.387
At any event venue that we
choose. From sporting events,

21:29.389 --> 21:33.691
to parades. Children's Birthday
parties.

21:33.693 --> 21:40.298
[Applause]

21:40.300 --> 21:45.369
If somebody asked me, Just why
meat eaters?

21:45.371 --> 21:49.640
Well yeah, we're starting with
the small stuff like a

21:49.642 --> 21:56.247
Butterfly or a lizard. But as
I'm sure you'll agree, Why wait?

21:56.381 --> 21:58.616
Let's go with the cool stuff.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.351
[Audience Laughs]

22:00.353 --> 22:08.426
Beyond the money to be made on
displays and shows. I wanted

22:08.428 --> 22:12.697
to make a point about humanities
future.

22:12.699 --> 22:18.502
Cause if we can make something
from 100 million years ago

22:18.504 --> 22:27.278
finally able to walk again, then
we can make anything walk again.

22:35.587 --> 22:45.696
[Cheers and Applause]

22:45.698 --> 23:07.852
[Cheers and Applause]

23:07.854 --> 23:09.820
And the Oscar goes to...

23:11.089 --> 23:12.456
Thank you Kim.

23:16.061 --> 23:23.934
[Laughs] Who am I fooling?
At the end of the day, it's not about

23:23.936 --> 23:27.238
Stocks. Or investments

23:27.240 --> 23:30.341
or even old men who can walk
again.

23:30.475 --> 23:34.945
It's about cool, Kick ass cool.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.816
Justin skip some pages. Drop Moe
and Larry. We are going

23:38.818 --> 23:40.651
Straight to the ceratosaurus.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.187
[Door Opens]

23:43.189 --> 23:48.192
These are just 1st of many
biotron of wonders.

23:48.194 --> 23:53.264
That will lead Geneti-Sharp into
the future.

23:53.266 --> 24:00.938
The people are sharp. The future
is sharp. Geneti-Sharp.

24:06.478 --> 24:10.281
Oh wait a second. There's one
more thing.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.350
Right now. In our warehouse.
Right next door.

24:13.352 --> 24:19.590
There are over 100 of these
wonderful creations being

24:19.592 --> 24:23.828
prepared for worldwide
distribution.

24:23.830 --> 24:31.802
Museums. Parades. Sporting events.
Even your own front yard.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.338
Ok, bring it back to the script.

24:34.340 --> 24:38.542
Sir. The Dinosaur is not
responding to the sonic waves.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.916
[Roar] The sonic pulses are
irritating the other Dinosaurs.

[Roar/ Glass Shattering]]

24:53.326 --> 25:01.866
While these are aggressive creatures.
We have built an even more aggressive cage.

25:01.868 --> 25:07.304
These cages can withstand 240,000psi.
Which is used to hold

25:07.306 --> 25:11.842
rocket ships together in
space. Nothing is going

25:11.844 --> 25:17.181
[Audience screaming] He's just a little spooked.
A little cranky.

25:17.183 --> 25:22.753
You would be too if you just woke up
from a 78 million year nap. [Laughs]

25:29.027 --> 25:31.629
Crap. Spray it.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.663
Heavy dose.

25:34.332 --> 25:37.334
There is no cause for alarm.
Trust me.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.715
Which way?

28:37.717 --> 28:38.716
We're going to split up.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.384

29:15.420 --> 29:17.554
Ok. What's going one here.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.089
It's a possible hostage
situation.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.824
So far a lot of chatter about
crazy stuff Sir.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.660
I don't care how crazy it
sounds. I need to know.

Yeah.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.555
It was alive?

30:26.157 --> 30:27.491
Yeah.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.826
It was gonna kill me.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.928
Listen we need to focus right
now.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.598
We're going to get through this.
Ok?

30:36.501 --> 30:37.968
It can't get to you in there.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.237
You're safe for the time being.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.972
There's more of them?

30:41.974 --> 30:42.940
Yes.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.008
We have to get out of here.

30:45.010 --> 30:49.346
Listen the police know.
The firefighters know. Everybody knows.

30:49.348 --> 30:53.917
The minute we walk out of this building,
there will be 500 uniforms out there.

30:53.919 --> 30:57.221
But they can to us right now and
we can't get out to them.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.189
This is the safest place for us.

30:59.191 --> 31:03.293
No. You're a fire fighter find
us a way out. You have to.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.329
I'm not gonna leave you.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.632
If we stay here, they're just gonna come back.
You have to find and exit.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.267
You said it would be safe in
here, right?

31:12.370 --> 31:17.207

back, alright?

The door appear to be electronically
bolted from the inside. The windows too.

do that?

For an entire building?

Doug?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.845
Sir. We had to lock down the
building.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.280
You've trapped everyone.

31:58.049 --> 31:59.116
Not everyone.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.085
I can't.

32:02.954 --> 32:03.720
No.

32:05.857 --> 32:12.029
We have to figure out a way to
recapture the Dinosaurs with -

32:12.031 --> 32:13.363
ok?

32:13.365 --> 32:14.765
The roof.

32:15.066 --> 32:18.735
Try to get everyone up to the
roof.

32:18.737 --> 32:22.306
Can Dinosaurs climb? Maybe.
Perhaps. Hopefully.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.776
Hopefully they - they can't
climb. And we'll get everyone to

32:25.778 --> 32:27.844
the roof and we'll evacuate from
there.

32:28.713 --> 32:34.618
Dr. Carson. You're a vet. Do Dinosaurs Climb?
We don't know if they can climb.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.353
Are you crazy?

32:36.888 --> 32:40.590
Do you know how many of these
reptiles just escaped?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.159
Maybe 2? 3?

32:42.161 --> 32:43.694
Is it 2 or is it 3?

32:43.696 --> 32:46.997
I don't know. Doug? 4?

32:46.999 --> 32:47.631
4?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.066
It was 16!

32:49.068 --> 32:52.102
Craig, you back off. I'm taking
care of this.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.738
This is Japan all over again.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.274
Wait! Doug you told me-

32:57.276 --> 32:59.876
You told me Japan was under
control.

32:59.878 --> 33:02.980
Guys! We have to focus on what's
going on right now.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.248
I'm not talking about Japan. We
gotta get out of here.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.584
It isn't safe here and you know it.
We gotta get you to the copter.

33:07.586 --> 33:13.123
No no no no. Doug is going to
tell me about Japan.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.403
Come on come on.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.138
Come on. Baby answer the phone.

33:42.253 --> 33:45.122
Sir. Another guy called. He says
he's inside the building.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.324
Let me guess. Another
Dinosaur story?

33:47.326 --> 33:52.029
This is different Sir.
This is one is Fire Department, Latter 42.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.730
He knew this number.

33:54.732 --> 33:56.400

Who is this?

33:57.669 --> 34:00.537
Gabe Jacobs. LAFD. I'm trapped
inside.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.606
What's going on inside.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.809
You're not gonna believe this,
but Dinosaurs have taken over the building.

34:05.811 --> 34:11.313
Listen, People are dying in here.
I need everything you've got coming in here.

34:36.775 --> 34:37.607
Make it 5.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.842
I'm on it.

34:44.047 --> 34:50.454
This is so - Kelly I'm not sure. We're not sure
what's going on here at the Geneti-Sharp event.

34:50.456 --> 34:56.226
But the police have set up a perimeter.
And whatever is happening is big.

36:19.777 --> 36:23.013

36:29.687 --> 36:33.423
What do you think happened in
Japan? Shit happened.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.658
Did people die?

36:34.660 --> 36:36.860
Yes! People Died!

36:36.862 --> 36:42.365
You knew about this and you let
THIS happen.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.901
It was - It was containable.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.571
No! Obviously not!

36:47.573 --> 36:52.609
I didn't ask to bring this
FREAKSHOW to life!

36:52.611 --> 36:54.411
I just made it happen.

36:55.513 --> 36:57.547
You're fired.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.182
Now get the hell outta here.

36:59.184 --> 37:01.851
I'm not going out there alone.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.187
He goes out there alone, he'll
die.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.823
And you? Why didn't you stop
him?

37:06.825 --> 37:13.230
Listen to me. Justin. You need me. Because I
have the key that will shut down the warehouse.

37:13.232 --> 37:17.334
Now with it, now without me.
This entire city is screwed.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.236
Cut it out. We haven't go time.

37:19.238 --> 37:22.272
My daughter is trapped in the
basement. In some kind of

37:22.274 --> 37:24.507
display cage with an
electronic lock.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.543
How do I open it?

37:26.545 --> 37:27.577
Who are you?

37:27.579 --> 37:30.046
I am Gabe Jacobs. LAFD.

37:31.649 --> 37:32.949
I know where that key is.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.785
Help us get out of here safe.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.220
I can do that.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.756
It's in an office. One floor
below us.

37:39.957 --> 37:41.191
We got to hurry.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.646
We've got to get to the room
now.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.980
RUN!

38:14.959 --> 38:16.359
What is this place?

38:16.361 --> 38:19.829
It's a panic room. The family is
safe in there.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.132
Well we as sure as hell aren't
in it.

38:22.134 --> 38:25.835
One there door is shut, it's locked until the
key code is punched in or outside panel.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.938
You miserable bastard.
You knew this was a panic room and you were

38:28.940 --> 38:30.607
going to leave us
out here to die.

38:32.009 --> 38:35.278
Only if you didn't make it in.
Looks like they get the last laugh.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.247
How do we get in there?

38:37.249 --> 38:39.482
Hey we can't get out of here.
Get help.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.119
Yes. Listen my daughter is
trapped in the basement.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.287
Calm down. Are there anymore
survivors?

39:17.289 --> 39:19.556
Yes but I don't know how many.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.625
Excuse me. This is my boss Justin Juarisco.
We have to get out of this building right now.

39:22.627 --> 39:25.762

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:21.850
Hockey Stick?

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.018
Yeah. I always wanted to play.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.486
I thought that was a boys game?

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.888
Ok. I'm learning. Let's go.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:32.120
Ah!

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:37.792
Ah!

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:40.962
I hate them dad. I hate them.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.353
Get up on the roof.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.187
What?-

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.222
Do it!

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.125
Yah!

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:12.327
Ah!

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:15.530
Yah!

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.465
[Groan]
Yaah!

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:26.307
[Alarm] Is there anyone coming to help us?

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:27.675
No response Sir.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.244
We're on our own.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:30.845
Sir, everything is having a
complete melt down.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.214
How much time do we have?

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.249
20 Minutes.

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:36.117
Maybe.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.287
Mr. Juarisco we need to get you out now.
There is a helicopter waiting outside.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.824
We can save this one.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.259
No we can't.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.094
Please.

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:47.862
You know I'm right.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.864
Get to the chopper now.

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:53.635
Rosario, We're Screwed!

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:54.536
We can win this one.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:08:00.008
Alright Rosario. Let's see what else
we can do to save this gigantic mess.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:03.545
Oh Shit!

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:11.186
[Screams]
Noooo!

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:17.459
[Pods Exploding]

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:19.461
[Screaming]

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.157
[Helicopter]

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.292
Sir they seem to be traveling in
a straight line.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:29.197
They're following the sent of
the first escape group.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:33.368
See that building over there
surrounded by the policemen?

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:37.071
They're heading in a straight
line for there.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.441
There's a lot of scent there.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.979
I can't find a safe place to
land.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.350
This is a damn war zone.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.354
Did you get in touch with the
police?

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.357
They're not listening. There's
too much chatter.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.560
Well they've got to know what's
coming.

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.895
Get me down there.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.871
Hey! Hey!

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:13.541
Wait. Wait a minute! The girl on
the roof.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:17.345
Hey! Down here!

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:18.713
Land there.

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.481
I got it. I got it.

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:24.352
I'm going to thread the needle
through the pipe. 5 by 5.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.169
My dad's downstairs. We have to
help him.

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:43.204
We have to save you.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:48.943
My dad is downstairs fighting Dinosaurs.
I'm not leaving without him.

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:50.712
Are you gonna help us or not?

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.914
You're going to have to guide
me. Come on.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:54.916
Come on!

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.318
Wait here.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.490
Phone call for you sir. Gabe
Jacobs LAFD again.

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.660
Chief Dawson.

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:08.129
I don't have a lot of time.
I'm in the building in the corner of 5th and Main.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:12.300
Yeah we're out here. We're right outside.
Look there's a helicopter.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.601
It just landed on the roof.
- Chief!

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.637
Chief! Chief!

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:17.438
Oh hell no!

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:22.010
Chief? Chief?

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:27.448
[Stomping]

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.523
[Groan]
Hold on.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.492
[Groan]
OK.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:52.674
[Sirens]

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:55.176
Chief. The Dinosaurs are going
into the building.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.219
Chief Dawson, LAPD to National
Guard.

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:09.090
There is still civilians and
LAFD inside the building.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:12.560
We cannot fire inside that building
until all the civilians are out.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:15.129
Copy that, but I can only give
you 10 minutes.

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:20.535
Orders are to eliminate the threat.
We'll hold as long as we can. But orders are orders Sir.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:21.536
Copy that.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:32.680
[Stomping]

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:33.681
Dad!

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:34.582
Dad!

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:35.850
Young lady look.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.418
My name is Jade.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.855
Jade, Look. We may have to face
the fact that your is-

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:46.961
No! No! He's a fire fighter.
He doesn't leave people behind and neither do I.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.963
We don't have much time.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.232
I have to find my father!

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.301
Jade!

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:02.844
We're going to have Dinosaur
company mighty soon.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.512
My helicopter is on the roof.

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.482
I'm never letting you go again.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:14.722
Look another 5 minutes. That's
all I'm asking. 5 minutes.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:18.559
I know there is at least 1 other
person inside that building.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.794
5 minutes!

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.629
Copy that.

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:25.466
Thank you. Thank you. That's all
I need is 5 minutes.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.903
Come on Gabe.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.538
Throw me a bone here.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.513
You ok?

01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:40.314
[Groan]
My leg's not doing so good.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:41.682
Come on. We'll help you.

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:43.284
No no no.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:47.688
You two go ahead. We're never
gonna make it this way.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:49.190
We're gonna make it.

01:13:49.192 --> 01:13:51.292
You know I'm right.

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:09.744
Dad.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:18.920
Dammit. We got to do something
about that. Walkie!

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:25.593
We need heavy fire power in the lobby.
I want that big son of a bitch taken down.

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.630
Sir the civilians are still in
there.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.234
Do you copy that?

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:43.644
Casey. I don't want you to think
that I'm some cold hearted bastard.

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.514
I've worked long and hard to
keep them safe there too.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.483
There's no way they are going
to make it to the roof with

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:51.085
that creature inside
up the infrastructure.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.456
We just have to hope and pray that the building
is strong enough to handle these bullets.

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:01.195
Fire!

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.980
Dad!

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:23.618
This building is not going to last long
enough for us to get to the roof.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:31.759
Jade, listen to me. You are going to take Mr.
Juarisco up to the roof.

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:33.628
I'm going to make sure they
don't get past us.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:34.428
No but dad-

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.130
The building is coming down.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.900
- Dad, I don't want to loose you again.
- Don't argue with me.

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:40.568
Listen.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:48.609
Sooner or later we all have to
pay the real bill of our deeds.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:54.048
And my Dinosaur mistake is-
[Laughs]

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.418
It's too big for anyone's
checkbook to cash.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.287
Gabe.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.224
Take care of your daughter.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.026
And no me. You have no choice.

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:06.394
No.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:07.595
- Let him go. Let him go. Come on.
- No.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.289
[Sigh]

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:44.932
And his final words were...

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.939
Final words. Final words.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:56.277
[Laughs]

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:58.613
Of course.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.567
Rock and Roll.

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.913
Almost there.

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.820
The helicopter should be
waiting.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:45.126
[Gunshots]

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:47.294
Oh! You've got to be kidding me!

01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:59.040
[Gunshots]

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.408
Everybody get back.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:03.077
She's gonna fall. Come on! Move
it, NOW!

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:09.150
[Crumbling/Crashing]

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.653
Hey listen. I love you very
much.

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:15.022
It's just nice to hear.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:19.527
I know I haven't been there for you but if we
ever get out of this, I'll do better. I promise.

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:21.862
Thanks for telling me now dad.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.106
Come on. Come on.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:33.974
Come on.

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:46.887
Jade.

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:58.032
Hang on!

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:25.826
[Screams]

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:29.363
The horse is dead. Follow that
pteranodon. Step on it.

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:30.631
Alright.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.019
It's headed for the Hollywood
sign.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.183
Hold on.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:27.087
Hey, you're really not gonna-
[Screams] Yes you are... whoa!

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.593
Your good.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.061
I know.

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.065
There there. Down there.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.038
There she is.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.573
Alright. I got it.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.942
Get ready. We only got one shot
at this.

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.185
Dad!

01:20:58.854 --> 01:20:59.854
Dad!

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.593
Lower! Lower!

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.231
Come on! Hover Hover!

01:21:10.233 --> 01:21:11.765
I'm hovering.

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:13.801
This is not hovering. Hover!

01:21:13.803 --> 01:21:15.870
It's all I got boss.

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.309
[Groans]
Ah.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:34.288
Come on.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.099
Dad, Hold on!

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:06.086
Jade! Look out!

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.721
[Gasp]

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.745
Hey!

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:34.848
Over here!

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.351
Come on! Come and get it.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.323
Come on. Come on! Come get me!

[Groans]

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.145
Bye Bye Birdie.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:55.262
[Explosion]

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.921
[Laugh]

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.925
You know, uh.

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.163
I thought you might want this
back.

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:32.399
Even though you hate Dinosaurs
now.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:36.470
No I don't hate them.
I just don't want to play with them anymore.
