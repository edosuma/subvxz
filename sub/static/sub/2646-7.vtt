10:44.983 --> 10:46.902
And this is the great room,

10:46.985 --> 10:49.905
although “great” hardly seems
to do a room like this justice.

10:49.988 --> 10:52.199
Weird, squiggly painting
not included.

10:52.324 --> 10:54.827
I actually love it. I do
too. It's really beautiful.

10:54.910 --> 10:57.955
Um, all custom built-ins,
and you will notice just...

10:58.038 --> 11:00.541
Just tons of natural light,
so that's great.

11:00.624 --> 11:03.502
Did I need the sale? Yes.
Was I worried? No.

11:03.585 --> 11:05.754
Why? Because.
Because why?

11:05.838 --> 11:09.174
Because I won't sell anything
I don't believe in.

11:09.258 --> 11:13.720
And when I believe, you believe.

11:13.804 --> 11:15.848
I could sell a fur coat
to an Eskimo.

11:15.931 --> 11:18.016
<i>Yeah, Phil, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful house.</i>

11:18.100 --> 11:21.645
But I'm just not sure how kid-friendly
it is, and we have two small children.

11:21.770 --> 11:23.790
I mean, these stairs alone—
Dad, this place is awesome.

11:23.814 --> 11:27.568
Not now, Luke. Did you see the
backyard? It's got room for 10 tree houses.

11:27.651 --> 11:31.864
And the bedroom's got a Window on
the ceiling. I wish we could live here.

11:31.947 --> 11:35.242
- I wish you'd go back out to
the patio where— - Do you really?

11:35.325 --> 11:38.954
Oh, yeah. Our house sucks
compared to this one.

11:39.037 --> 11:41.999
- Hmm.
- It really does.

we'll go back to Manny's match, okay?

11:49.006 --> 11:52.092
Dad doesn't want me to go.
What? Why?

11:52.175 --> 11:54.928

all worried that our son's a dud?

11:55.012 --> 11:57.014
Okay. That's not exactly
the way I remember it.

11:57.097 --> 11:59.099

At selling.

Hey, titans of
residential real estate.

12:05.772 --> 12:10.903
That's right, I'm talking to you, Sandy
Brewster, Skip Woosnum, J.J. McCubbin.

- I'm charging it.

12:43.185 --> 12:45.771
Nope. Okay, fine. That's your

12:45.854 --> 12:48.398
But you should know, it's hard
on the people who love you.

12:48.523 --> 12:52.402

hear the words that cut like knives.

12:55.113 --> 12:56.990

I can't bear this.

12:57.115 --> 13:01.328
Claire, Mitchell still resents you for quitting
the figure skating team when you were kids.

13:01.411 --> 13:04.915
Ladies, come inside with me,
please. Work it out. Come on.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.709
Thanks, Cam.
Is he serious?

13:07.834 --> 13:12.422
Is that what your little jab was about this
morning? Okay. No. Yes. Okay, yes. Yes.

13:12.506 --> 13:16.259
I guess I'm still a little angry. But,
you know, you stole my moment, Claire.

13:16.385 --> 13:18.363
Yeah, 21 years ago. Okay,
but it doesn't matter to you...

13:18.387 --> 13:20.263
because you had
your own moments.

13:20.389 --> 13:23.725
You had cheerleading and high school
plays and making out with the quarterback.

13:23.850 --> 13:27.229
You made out with him too.
Yeah, but we had to keep it a secret.

13:28.855 --> 13:31.984
You shouldn't have quit. It was
selfish. You wanna know why I quit?

13:32.109 --> 13:35.112
I quit to protect you.
From what?

13:35.237 --> 13:38.824
Glory? Fame? Press conferences?
What? Come on. I was bigger than you.

13:38.907 --> 13:41.747
I was bigger than you, and I was
afraid you wouldn't be able to lift me.

13:41.785 --> 13:43.596
You were dropping me in
practice— I dropped you twice.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.099
And I didn't want you to humiliate
yourself in front of all those people.

13:46.123 --> 13:50.711
Three times. You dropped
me all the time. [Sighs]

13:50.836 --> 13:56.091
Come on. Could you just forgive
me and move on? [ Exhales]

13:57.676 --> 14:01.179
Of course. Yes, yes. Yes,
of— I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:01.263 --> 14:04.224
Oh. This must seem
so petty, huh?

14:04.307 --> 14:07.644
Well, it's a little silly, but we
all have our thing, don't we?

14:07.728 --> 14:10.105
I'm just glad you're
getting it out of you.

14:10.188 --> 14:14.276

You're trying to lift me. Oh!

Oh, thank you.

Oh, is Manny yours?
Yes.

14:49.019 --> 14:51.271
Oh, he's quite good.
I saw him earlier.

14:51.354 --> 14:52.898
Thank you.
Yeah.

14:53.023 --> 14:55.108
Is she your little girl?
Oh, Caroline? No. No.

14:55.192 --> 14:57.444
Sadly, her parents passed away.

14:57.527 --> 14:59.863
I'm her nurse down at

not start blaming the floors.

You shouldn't have been
running. I saw a ghost.

Okay, that's me.

a natural shoehorn.

15:46.535 --> 15:50.914

off for this part of the tour. Follow me.

nice to see him that proud of us.

16:37.377 --> 16:40.172
By us, I mean me.
[Scoffs]

16:40.255 --> 16:42.924
And you sincerely thought
that the path to Dad's approval...

16:43.008 --> 16:44.926
was going to be through
figure skating?

16:45.010 --> 16:48.054
Mitchell, I am fairly confident
that Dad's proudest moment...

16:48.138 --> 16:50.432
was when you finally took off
the flame-red unitard.

16:50.515 --> 16:53.310
I am not claiming that
any of this is rational.

16:55.770 --> 16:59.524
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for being such a pill, okay?

17:00.775 --> 17:05.030
Um, actually, I always felt
very guilty for quitting.

17:05.113 --> 17:07.115
I know how much
you loved figure skating.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.119
I never really loved skating.

Uh, What?

17:14.122 --> 17:16.791
Um, all right, this is

But, um, when-when
you and I skated together,

17:19.961 --> 17:23.381
you weren't the mean older sister
and I wasn't the clingy little brother.

17:23.465 --> 17:25.383
We were— We were a team, and...

17:25.467 --> 17:28.386
Well, let's face it, we've kind of
grown apart in the past few years.

17:28.470 --> 17:31.723
And with Mom and Dad's divorce,
we were on opposing sides.

17:31.806 --> 17:35.810

I miss being on your team.
