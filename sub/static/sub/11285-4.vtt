42:28.680 --> 42:29.879
NO!
NO?

42:29.881 --> 42:30.880
LIKE ONE OF THOSE RULES

42:30.882 --> 42:32.081
WHERE THE PERFECT GUY
COMES ALONG

42:32.083 --> 42:34.651
AND THE RULE WOULD GO
OUT THE WINDOW?

42:34.653 --> 42:36.386
NO, NO, NO.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.120
IT'S ONE OF THOSE RULES
THAT...

42:38.123 --> 42:42.559
IT JUST REMINDS ME THAT
I NEED BALANCE IN MY LIFE.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.261
I MEAN, THE PERFECT GUY
JUST CAME ALONG.

42:51.336 --> 42:52.735
OKAY.

42:56.942 --> 42:58.141
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

42:58.143 --> 43:01.177
¶ I've got something ¶

43:01.179 --> 43:04.080
¶ You've got something ¶

43:04.082 --> 43:09.252
¶ We've got something ¶
