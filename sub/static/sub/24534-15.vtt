00:16.510 --> 00:20.219
Al, do you copy? I repeat, do you copy?

00:22.640 --> 00:24.141
The battery could have died.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.589
Or she did.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.141
Shut it, Jimbo.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.942
What the hell is Mo-Mo doing over there?

00:34.740 --> 00:36.480
I don't know what the hell
you're waiting for him to do.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.730
He got us into this.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.115
You're on your own now.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.577
I see that bite really
brought out the best in you.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.413
Can I do the honours
when he become a skin-muncher?

00:46.170 --> 00:47.159
Jesus, really?

00:48.130 --> 00:49.495
Nice bedside, asshole.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.711
Anyhow, the way
things are looking right now,

00:53.010 --> 00:55.376
I'm not the only one
who's gonna have to get put down.

01:00.510 --> 01:01.966
We are going to find Al.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.011
We are going to find
our way down from here.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.226
But I don't know how.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.021
I'm sorry, but I really don't.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.236
You don't want to lead the way...

01:18.820 --> 01:19.866
that's fine.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.537
But you can help. You know you can.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.536
Al, are you there? Do you copy?

01:33.340 --> 01:38.289
Hey! Over here! Hey! Strand!

01:39.470 --> 01:40.346
John.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.976
How the hell did they find us?

01:57.530 --> 01:58.736
Perhaps you were right.

01:59.530 --> 02:01.157
Perhaps we just needed to believe.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.201
Al, 0’0 you copy?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.495
I repeat; do you copy?

02:12.800 --> 02:13.664
June?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.755
Alicia, is that you?

02:18.180 --> 02:21.968
Yeah. I'm... I'm with Charlie.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.267
And you're not gonna believe it.
We just found John and Strand.

02:31.020 --> 02:31.896
John.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.645
He can't hear you. We see them,

02:33.730 --> 02:34.856
but they're cut off by the flooding.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.180
We're gonna get them, though.

02:38.780 --> 02:39.656
Can I?

02:41.410 --> 02:42.274
Alicia?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.651
Morgan. Where are you?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.957
Can't tell you over the walkie.
It's not safe.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.029
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

02:53.670 --> 02:58.084
Um, we got stuck. I, um...

02:59.380 --> 03:00.540
I got us stuck.

03:02.970 --> 03:04.346
Don't know if there's a way out.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.470
I did what you told me.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.567
I tried to be there
for someone when they needed.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.316
I tried, and that's how
I found John and Strand.

03:18.650 --> 03:21.062
So I'm gonna get them to safety,
and then I'm gonna come find you.

03:21.740 --> 03:24.527
So just hang in there.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.616
We just have to find A! first.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.492
Yeah. We should do that.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.506
Alicia, you be careful.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.869
And when you get John and Strand,

03:40.970 --> 03:42.710
you walkie us, please.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.676
Got it.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.058
So, how exactly are we
getting down off this roof?

03:52.140 --> 03:53.767
Maybe the same way we came up.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.546
She's hungry today.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.591
They ain't coming back.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.090
They can't find a way to get to us.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.557
I doubted if anyone
would show up in the first place.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.762
But it appears my doubts were unfounded.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.935
As well as these.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.140
Is that why you're drowning your sorrows?

04:45.910 --> 04:46.774
I'm saving it.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.734
For what?

04:47.910 --> 04:50.196
For when we get off
this water-logged piece of dirt.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.281
I want to get back to June

04:53.580 --> 04:54.615
more than you can know.

04:54.710 --> 04:57.577
What makes you think that Alicia
and Charlie can do what we couldn't?

04:57.670 --> 05:00.161
I said things would get worse,
and they did.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.961
And I'm afraid that
you're in the place where I was.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.257
Unable to see
the promise of what lies ahead

05:06.340 --> 05:11.050
even as it presents itself as clear as day
across these foetid waters.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.925
Who I was...

05:16.020 --> 05:17.305
the way I looked at life...

05:18.770 --> 05:20.146
I mighta used all that up.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.026
I mighta.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.816
Maybe not.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.948
I put myself on an island before.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.112
Well, not an actual, but away.

05:32.370 --> 05:34.247
Apart, for things I did.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.957
I know I've been
living on the brighter side,

05:37.040 --> 05:38.621
but that's just 'cause
someone helped me see it.

05:38.710 --> 05:42.123
Someone else took me off that island.

05:42.210 --> 05:44.007
Someone's gonna help you get off this one.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.381
You know what Charlie did to Alicia,

05:49.140 --> 05:50.926
what she took from her, who she took?

05:52.930 --> 05:55.262
And now they're out there...

05:56.640 --> 05:57.686
working together.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.646
And if that doesn't
make you think anything is possible,

06:06.820 --> 06:08.060
I don't know what else will.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.548
Alicia. How 'bout that?

06:25.420 --> 06:27.126
He said there were
gators In the water.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.710
And we need something that'll float.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.213
A boat, a canoe. Come on.

07:55.430 --> 07:56.306
Wait!

08:01.730 --> 08:03.049
You think I'm gonna jump?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.550
Then what is it you're doin' up there?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.941
You ever see one of these meat puppets

08:12.030 --> 08:14.191
trying to walk around
with a bunch of broken bones?

08:15.700 --> 08:18.988
Not how I plan on spending
however long it takes some a-hole

08:20.000 --> 08:22.321
to push a sharp,
pointy object through my skull.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.586
Ah...

08:27.670 --> 08:30.628
I figure I can't go down there,

08:30.710 --> 08:32.166
kill any of those goddamn things.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.756
Pissing on 'em's
the only f-you I got here.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.380
Ah.

08:45.810 --> 08:46.686
Anything else,

08:46.770 --> 08:50.024
or you just comin' over to make yourself
feel better about what you did to me?

08:56.660 --> 08:58.400
We're gonna try to get to Al

09:00.080 --> 09:01.991
and then find a way out of here.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.616
You asking me to help?

09:04.620 --> 09:06.451
I know I don't have the right to ask.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.745
I just wanted to say that

09:14.010 --> 09:16.501
you can't do anything about
the fact you're gonna die, Jim.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.387
But you can decide exactly how you go.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.768
You're right. I can.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.182
You might want to
take a little step to the left.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.971
The wind's changing direction.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.695
He's not coming.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.256
Really, Jimbo?

09:58.590 --> 09:59.841
Tell Morgan I'm not going.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.045
Not why I'm here.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.057
Your beer recipe,

10:04.310 --> 10:05.265
hand it over.

10:07.730 --> 10:11.268
Look, we go down there,

10:12.190 --> 10:13.851
we may never see you again.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.736
At least not like this.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.439
Go to hell, Sarah.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.366
You are a class-A asshole.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.451
An unpleasant jagoff

10:30.750 --> 10:33.332
who fills every room he steps into

10:33.550 --> 10:35.370
with a philosophical fart.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.962
But your beer... man.

10:39.380 --> 10:40.881
It's poetry in a bottle.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.514
That's you, too. That can live on.

10:51.940 --> 10:52.895
You're right.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.350
It is an exceptional brew.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.809
Packs a nutritional punch,

11:00.570 --> 11:01.980
prevents water-borne disease,

11:04.120 --> 11:05.360
extremely refreshing.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.202
_ And it contains
a high enough alcohol content

11:09.290 --> 11:10.416
to provide a welcome buzz.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.701
It's exactly what this shithole needs.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.087
Hell, it even brought
comfort to a dying man.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.251
You know what would
bring comfort to this dying man?

11:27.140 --> 11:29.381
You turning around

11:30.230 --> 11:31.800
and leaving me the hell alone.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.350
And if you trip and break your neck,

11:36.150 --> 11:37.970
well, we'll just call that a bonus.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.741
Nice knowing ya, Jimbo.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.495
That's what we need.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.342
Charlie, can you...

12:07.060 --> 12:07.924
Charlie! Go!

12:08.310 --> 12:09.675
I heard you!

12:09.770 --> 12:10.725
Get down!

12:10.850 --> 12:12.386
You shouldn't be helping them!

12:14.650 --> 12:16.857
They broke my chain,

12:17.900 --> 12:20.983
but I'm going to fix it!

12:21.610 --> 12:24.693
I am going to make you strong!

12:27.030 --> 12:28.440
You're hurt. We can help you.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.440
I don't need any help!

12:31.660 --> 12:33.036
I am not weak!

12:35.580 --> 12:36.740
We can help you!

12:37.670 --> 12:42.084
I said I don't need any help! I don't...

13:13.790 --> 13:15.326
It's the woman on the walkie.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.184
Where are they?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.059
You really want to know?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.075
Let's stay close.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.957
Find Al, and then
we circle back to here, okay?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.415
Mmm.

14:42.290 --> 14:44.417
At least _we know
where all the jerkymen went.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.296
Didn't come down long ago.

14:47.590 --> 14:48.966
We got to be careful.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.715
Generator's this way.

15:16.370 --> 15:17.860
Looks like AI's been busy.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.136
Al?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.509
Al?

15:53.450 --> 15:54.565
She left a message.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.666
"Hope you're alive.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.957
Damn walkie died,
and I don't know if you did,

16:06.250 --> 16:07.956
so I'm gonna go for the freight elevator.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.621
If you read this
and I'm dead in the hallway,

16:10.720 --> 16:13.120
find my goddamn tapes and keep them safe.

16:13.220 --> 16:14.209
Make copies,

16:14.550 --> 16:16.506
leave a stash somewhere if you can.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.555
IfI make it,

16:17.640 --> 16:18.800
that's what I'm gonna do.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.301
And if you find that C-word,

16:23.060 --> 16:24.345
settle her shit."

16:26.980 --> 16:28.140
She didn't use the "C-word."

16:28.230 --> 16:29.891
She went for the full quesadilla.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.697
Hey... gennie got
a little bit of juice left.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.907
These elevators won't be running for long.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.031
We're gonna find that freight elevator.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.371
It's gonna get infected
from being in that muck.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.211
Come on!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.580
Maybe not.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.749
You hear that?

17:01.810 --> 17:03.220
What, that damn grackle?

17:04.560 --> 17:05.436
Nah.

17:46.850 --> 17:49.182
It appears to be the cocktail hour.

18:15.170 --> 18:16.376
We were looking for a boat.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.586
We found this instead.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.094
Hey.

18:30.900 --> 18:31.764
Hey, kid.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.276
Here.

18:35.690 --> 18:39.774
Thank you. Hey... we talkin' now?

18:45.700 --> 18:46.576
You okay?

18:50.540 --> 18:51.416
You?

18:55.340 --> 18:57.547
And who might our fellow passenger be?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.501
There's another way
to the freight elevator.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.461
The hall doubles back
just before the collapsed ceiling.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.016
We should go. Come on.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.567
Morgan, what is it?

19:20.740 --> 19:21.809
Outside.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.155
Still surrounded.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.405
Even if you get down there,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.367
you're never gonna get away
unless somebody distracts 'em.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.030
'_ NO.
- No, you just can't stay.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.337
I got you in here.
I have got to get you out.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.206
So I'm...

19:36.300 --> 19:37.369
I just got to...

19:38.380 --> 19:40.257
I just got to do something to, um,

19:40.340 --> 19:42.467
draw them away from the front. That's it.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.927
We can figure something else out.
You don't have to stay.

19:45.010 --> 19:46.716
I do. I have to.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.307
And you have to let me, June.

19:53.770 --> 19:55.010
And you're gonna get out?

20:02.450 --> 20:03.348
You got to go.

20:12.080 --> 20:12.956
Okay.

20:26.140 --> 20:27.846
You get all them killed, too?

20:29.390 --> 20:31.381
Come on. We got work to do.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.362
Morgan, it's safe to talk now.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.286
That person you were
worried might be listening...

20:53.830 --> 20:54.819
she ain't.

20:57.630 --> 20:58.915
John, is that you?

21:01.300 --> 21:02.164
June?

21:02.760 --> 21:06.218
John. Thank God. Are you okay?

21:07.180 --> 21:08.295
Uh...

21:09.970 --> 21:11.881
I... I opened up my side a little bit,

21:12.140 --> 21:15.223
but, uh, boy, to hear your voice...

21:15.690 --> 21:17.180
Yeah, I'm pretty good now.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.390
Are you and Al okay?

21:19.520 --> 21:21.101
I am. I think Al is.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.317
I wasn't sure if _
I was gonna talk to you again.

21:25.530 --> 21:28.021
Boy... boy, I'm being honest,

21:28.120 --> 21:29.735
I wasn't sure, either.

21:31.370 --> 21:35.704
I had a blackjack for you, but I ate it.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.081
Well, you had to build up your strength.

21:41.590 --> 21:42.454
Where are you?

21:43.090 --> 21:45.160
Hospital. St. Luke’s in the city.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.000
We're headed for you now.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.460
Stay in contact.

21:49.550 --> 21:50.505
We'll meet in the outskirts.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.340
The city's full of the dead,

21:52.770 --> 21:54.340
and we can't miss each other again.

21:55.690 --> 21:56.554
Yes, ma ’am.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.948
Mo-Mo, we're gonna need that distraction.

22:19.290 --> 22:20.279
Copy that.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.160
Here’s what] need you to do.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.831
You get back inside
away from those things.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.376
I just need a minute.

22:45.570 --> 22:49.449
No. No! What did you do to me?

22:49.530 --> 22:51.020
Hey, hey. Easy there.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.327
I'd say we were pretty cordial,

22:54.160 --> 22:55.991
considering what you did to our friends.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.320
I wanted to leave you
on the side of the road.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.205
You should have.

23:01.790 --> 23:02.950
You would have died.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.541
At least I wouldn't have been weak.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.291
I remember what Morgan said

23:06.380 --> 23:08.587
on the walkie before you shot him.
He wanted to find you.

23:08.670 --> 23:11.138
He wanted to help you.
That's why you're here.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.966
When you see him, you can thank him.

23:17.100 --> 23:21.434
He'll be thankin' me.
You'll see.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.749
You come to give me a hand?

23:53.260 --> 23:54.966
'Cause this may not just take one.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.841
I got a pretty good reason not to.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.097
Okay. Okay.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.080
Argh!

24:56.370 --> 24:58.611
Come on! I don't know
how long that's gonna last.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.940
You need to get going!

25:09.130 --> 25:10.586
Jim, too. We'll wait.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.629
Power's out, June.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.721
Elevators are not working,

25:25.810 --> 25:27.892
and the stairwell ’s ﬂooded with walkers.

25:27.980 --> 25:29.060
You just got to go.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.777
Morgan, if this is about
leading us all into the hospital,

25:31.860 --> 25:33.771
any one of us would have made that call.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.980
It's not about that.
It's not. It's about...

25:38.950 --> 25:40.269
things...

25:40.540 --> 25:42.189
things I got to make up for.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.866
And I don't know that
I can make up for all of them,

25:45.960 --> 25:48.246
but if I know that
I got you all out of here, that I, uh...

25:49.340 --> 25:51.456
I got you on your way back to John,

25:51.960 --> 25:55.714
Strand Alicia, hack to Charlie, then,

25:57.300 --> 25:59.757
I don't know,
maybe that could make up for something.

26:02.470 --> 26:03.346
Morgan.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.807
Now go. You got to get out of here. Go!

26:09.150 --> 26:10.139
June!

26:26.710 --> 26:28.200
You're off the hook.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.870
At least with them.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.376
Hey, I get it.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.200
Whatever you got to make up for.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.960
It's hard, because...

26:40.090 --> 26:41.591
you have to give everything.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.419
It may not work out.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.056
Even if it does work out, you don't know

26:48.020 --> 26:51.103
what you've done really will
make up for the other stuff.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.776
So, you being up on this roof,

26:57.110 --> 26:59.066
I think you got yourself an easy way out.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.656
Take it from a class-A asshole.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.280
Death is a certainty.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.783
Getting out from
under the shit you've done isn't.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.974
Do me a favour. Before I, uh...

27:39.900 --> 27:40.776
Would you?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.797
Morgan, do you copy?

28:00.630 --> 28:03.679
June? What's going on?

28:04.430 --> 28:06.250
We ’re getting you
of?c that roo/i Morgan.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.976
We're not leaving you behind.

28:11.060 --> 28:14.973
No. No, the car alarm is dead.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.430
You guys got out. You got to keep going.

28:18.150 --> 28:20.892
I will find my own way out of this place.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.236
lVot Without us, you won ’t.

28:26.990 --> 28:28.070
God, John?

28:28.540 --> 28:32.579
Yeah. I wasn't gonna
leave you high and dry.

28:32.670 --> 28:36.379
Look, there are too many walkers
for you to get through in here.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.496
This morning I was on an island

28:38.590 --> 28:41.047
guarded by one of
the largest gators I ever saw.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.506
Then I drive here in a Sl/l/A 7' van

28:43.720 --> 28:46.883
helpin' stitch up a woman who
just tried to kill everyone I care about.

28:48.350 --> 28:50.011
Seems like anything's possible.

28:51.180 --> 28:52.226
We ’re in position.

28:52.850 --> 28:53.726
Alicia?

28:53.810 --> 28:55.346
Yeah, Morgan.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.010
You told me to help people.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.680
That's what I'm doing.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.520
We're all here, Mo-Mo.

29:06.070 --> 29:09.119
She's right. We all came back.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.323
You know,
I told you guys to go for a reason.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.126
We heard you, Morgan.

29:16.750 --> 29:17.990
But you ’re wrong.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.958
No matter what you think, we need you.

29:27.010 --> 29:31.128
Well... don't get off
as easy as you thought.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.566
You shouldn't be doing this.

29:39.650 --> 29:41.106
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.560
We already are.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.650
Where the hell did you get that from?

29:52.950 --> 29:54.702
Passed it on the way out.

29:54.790 --> 29:57.452
Engine's dead,
but generator for the hydraulic

29:57.540 --> 29:58.950
still purrs like a kitten.

30:07.930 --> 30:08.965
Ready to do this?

30:09.050 --> 30:10.426
Let's bring 'em down.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.550
This isn't going to end well.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.478
You should leave... now.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.740
Okay, we got to keep this area clear.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.511
You're shy by a couple of stories.

31:02.190 --> 31:04.181
Morgan, can you
make it down to that level?

31:12.950 --> 31:14.235
Wait.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.050
Come on. Let's go.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.687
Hey, I can't... I'm...

31:49.650 --> 31:51.106
I can't leave you up here.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.866
You can't do anything for me.

32:01.710 --> 32:02.665
Go.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.086
Go.

32:10.510 --> 32:11.829
Man, I'm real sorry.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.215
You should be.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.716
Don't give yourself a reason
to be sorry for them, too.

32:37.370 --> 32:38.860
Come on, come on.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.600
Morgan!

33:44.480 --> 33:45.629
Alicia, do you copy?

33:46.020 --> 33:46.896
Copy.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.436
How we looking?

33:49.900 --> 33:52.061
We're drawing a crowd.
You were louder than expected.

33:52.150 --> 33:53.936
We don ’t have much time.

34:34.610 --> 34:36.987
I think it's time y'all
got up here out of the fray.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.269
Got it.

34:44.790 --> 34:45.654
June.

34:49.580 --> 34:50.786
Oh. Back up, back...

35:14.360 --> 35:16.066
This is one hell of a predicament.

35:16.150 --> 35:18.357
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.233
Wendell. You all right down there?

35:24.120 --> 35:26.247
I don't know if "all right"
is the word I'd use,

35:26.330 --> 35:28.321
but we still tickin'.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.166
I'm out.

35:31.080 --> 35:31.956
Same.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.428
We need to clear a path to the van.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.886
Wendell, I'm hopping off
and drawing them away.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.722
- They'll carry you to the van.
- Morgan...

35:48.810 --> 35:49.686
No.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.839
I said I'm gonna get you out of here.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.396
That's what I'm gonna do.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.432
It’s okay, Morgan. 1' got this.

36:01.110 --> 36:01.986
Jim?

36:05.120 --> 36:09.284
Morgan, you told me
I get to choose how I go.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.911
I think this beats pissing in the wind.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.126
Sarah, are you there?

36:16.090 --> 36:18.376
Yeah, Jimbo. Why?

36:18.800 --> 36:20.916
I want you to remember something.

36:21.590 --> 36:22.466
What?

36:25.180 --> 36:26.636
My recipe.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.305
Shit on a stick.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.276
Go, Jimbo.

37:07.010 --> 37:09.001
68% pils malt...

37:09.100 --> 37:12.729
15% wheat malt
Weyermann Wheat Malt;

37:12.980 --> 37:16.939
7% ﬂaked oats, J 0% percent Vienna,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.477
40 grams 5/0 venian pellets,

37:20.360 --> 37:23.443
70 grams Czech Saaz whole hops.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.480
You getting' this?

37:27.200 --> 37:29.907
Yeah, Jimbo. Keep going.

37:29.990 --> 37:33.323
You need Belg/an and French 5aison yeast.

37:33.460 --> 37:37.282
You ’re gonna want to cook
the mash at 15] to 152 Fahrenheit.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.530
Pitch the yeast at 68.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.257
Hold for ten days, no less.

37:45.010 --> 37:46.125
And, Sarah...

37:47.180 --> 37:48.044
Yeah?

37:50.100 --> 37:51.840
Hold the mic up close to your ear.

37:54.730 --> 37:58.109
This is the most important part;
so no one else can know.

38:10.490 --> 38:11.787
That it, Jimbo?

38:12.330 --> 38:15.072
Well, there's love in there, too,
if you can believe it, but...

38:16.290 --> 38:17.325
YeP-

38:19.130 --> 38:20.119
That's it.

38:31.970 --> 38:32.846
Copy that.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.189
We should get out of here.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.584
She's gone.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.795
She slipped right out.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.138
She's hurt. We have to look for her.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.209
No time, kiddo.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.175
She didn't want our help to begin with.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.724
Morgan.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.165
Did he tell you enough?

40:28.670 --> 40:30.217
Can you make his beer?

40:35.260 --> 40:36.670
What are we gonna call it?

40:37.260 --> 40:39.216
I mean, when we brew it?

40:43.900 --> 40:45.185
He had a name.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.390
Augie's Ales.

40:48.020 --> 40:50.181
He died so we could make his beer.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.408
I'm not calling it
whatever chicken shit name

40:54.490 --> 40:57.118
some marketing company
told him to give it.

40:57.370 --> 40:59.941
We need to give it a name
that means something.

41:03.670 --> 41:04.659
James Ales?

41:07.250 --> 41:08.831
Jim's Brews, maybe?

41:09.670 --> 41:10.830
Jimbo Brews?

41:13.090 --> 41:14.921
Jimbo's Beerbos.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.847
Jimbo's Beerbos.

41:21.350 --> 41:23.432
Man, he would hate that.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.727
Yeah. I know.

41:26.310 --> 41:28.813
Jimbo's Beerbos.

41:47.750 --> 41:48.910
So, where are we going?

41:51.420 --> 41:53.001
We need to get out of the city.

41:53.090 --> 41:54.500
There's not much out there.

41:54.590 --> 41:56.080
At least not what we've seen.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.547
The hurricane pretty much took out
whatever hadn't already been taken out.

42:07.190 --> 42:08.054
Morgan?

42:15.070 --> 42:17.152
I told Jim about Virginia

42:17.240 --> 42:19.526
first time I met him,
just like I told all of you...

42:20.780 --> 42:22.361
that that's where I was heading.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.417
Well, he's not gonna make it,
but I think that we can.

42:33.550 --> 42:35.040
So let's find Al,

42:36.800 --> 42:38.791
and then I say we make our way there.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.715
Together.

43:56.340 --> 43:58.251
You're strong now.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.428
Let's go make him strong, too
