00:51.920 --> 00:55.037
Gravity 1.5.
Wind 40 knots and variable.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.392
Coordinates locked and set. Launch scouter.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.474
Wait a minute. I'm in charge of security
and surveillance aboard this vessel.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.673
I, Mr Kryten, am the one
who says "Launch scouter".

01:08.840 --> 01:11.912
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean to steal your thunder.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.630
Launch scouter.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.788
Launch scouter.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.590
I'll be in the stern, correlating the...

01:30.760 --> 01:32.352
in the stern.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.709
Would you be so good
as to launch the scouter, sir?

01:36.880 --> 01:38.871
Aye-aye, sir!

01:39.840 --> 01:41.831
Scouter launched, sir!

01:51.720 --> 01:55.156
Sir, it appears we've encountered
a scientific research centre.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.273
- And someone's in there, man. A survivor.
- A Dr Hildegarde Lanstrom.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.358
Clearly, I am superfluous to this entire operation,

02:02.520 --> 02:07.913
ably commanded as it is by a droid
who was created purely to clean lavatories,

02:08.080 --> 02:11.277
so why are you telling me this, Captain Bog-Bot?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.159
She's a hologram.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.990
We have to commandeer your projection unit
in order to rescue her, sir.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.594
Oh, I see. First, I'm deemed unsuitable
to issue the command "launch scouter",

02:25.760 --> 02:31.153
and now I'm being relieved of my duties
by Commander U-Bend.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.309
Rimmer, it's not personal.
It's the only way to get her to the ship.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.956
- Why do we need another hologram?
- She's a doctor, sir.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.079
- She would be a valuable asset.
- As usual, it's left to me

02:44.240 --> 02:46.470
to point out the flaw in your logic.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.150
- Flaw?
- This vessel, gentlemen and khazi droids...

02:51.320 --> 02:56.792
the crimson short one up there, can only
sustain one hologram, or had you forgotten?

02:59.640 --> 03:02.791
- You hadn't forgotten?
- Look, we'll work something out.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.474
Some kind of "timeshare" thing.

03:05.680 --> 03:09.309
What am I, a holiday villa in the Algarve?

03:09.520 --> 03:13.832
Sir, might I remind you, as Space Corps
Directive 169 clearly states...

03:14.040 --> 03:18.397
Holly, prepare an escape pod.
Anything but another "Space Corps directive".

03:18.600 --> 03:20.955
Sir, the directives are there to protect us.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.476
They're not vindictive pronouncements
directed against any one person.

03:24.680 --> 03:30.312
Has anyone ever seen this legendary
Space Corps directive manual?

03:33.520 --> 03:35.875
- Well, no.
- He's making it up.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.510
- The bloody book doesn't exist.
- Sir, I assure you...

03:39.720 --> 03:42.996
Why does he only use them
against me, never Lister?

03:43.160 --> 03:45.549
We never hear Space Corps directives

03:45.720 --> 03:50.396
that state, "No crew member should floss
his teeth with the E-string of his guitar

03:50.560 --> 03:55.839
"after spraying the contents of his Sugar Puff
sandwich all over his superior's bunk. "

03:56.000 --> 03:59.675
- We never hear that one.
- Holly, furnish Mr Rimmer

03:59.840 --> 04:03.435
with a hologrammatic copy
of the Space Corps directive manual.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.636
Come on. Where is it?

04:06.400 --> 04:09.472
- That's it?!
- You can study it at your leisure

04:09.640 --> 04:11.631
on your trip back to Red Dwarf, sir.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.315
- You've changed, you know that?
- Changed?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.755
They may not see it,
but I know what's going on.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.673
You've become a really nasty piece of work.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.628
- Sir, I was merely...
- You're merely a mechanoid, that's all.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.836
Don't ever forget it.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.870
What a smee...

04:35.080 --> 04:36.832
What a smee...

04:37.240 --> 04:40.630
What a smee... heeeeeeee...

04:49.400 --> 04:51.391
Dr Lanstrom?

04:55.640 --> 04:57.870
Are you there, Doctor?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.915
Oh, brutal.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.991
No need for alarm, sir. If there were
dangerous viral strains in the atmosphere,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.470
the psi-scan
would have picked them up by now.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.310
It's never done that before.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.551
Blasted, stupid...
Cheap damn stupid Martian power packs.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.431
So what's the news?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.273
Well, just a few seconds more, sir.

05:50.440 --> 05:54.353
The old 345 takes a little time to warm up.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.956
Still, it out-performs the 346
eight times out of nine.

05:58.120 --> 06:03.911
Small wonder that it secured "Psi-Scan of the
Year, Best Budget Model" three years running.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.230
Now here are the results...

06:07.320 --> 06:09.117
And we're going to...

06:09.880 --> 06:11.677
live.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.912
We're a real Mickey Mouse operation, aren't we?

06:17.520 --> 06:20.512
Mickey Mouse? We ain't even Betty Boop!

06:24.400 --> 06:26.595
Oh. Extraordinary.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.197
Incredible.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.511
Hey, look at this.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.150
A nest of stasis pods.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.634
I must have triggered something.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.511
Doctor? Doctor Lanstrom?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.875
And who might you be?

06:55.280 --> 06:58.238
Hi. We were passing. We picked up the beacon.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.553
Schopenhauer was right, wouldn't you say?

07:02.320 --> 07:06.029
Life without pain has no meaning.

07:07.640 --> 07:12.953
Gentlemen, I wish to give your lives meaning.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.915
- Why can't we ever meet anyone nice?
- Or anyone who can shoot straight?

07:27.720 --> 07:30.553
I'm telling you, Kryten is taking over.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.550
Remember how he was in the early days?
A gibbering wreck, no self-confidence,

07:35.720 --> 07:38.473
plagued by guilt, convinced he was fourth-rate?

07:38.640 --> 07:43.156
- I really liked him then.
- Escape pod checked and standing by.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.272
- Well, check it again.
- I've done three checks.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.432
- It's ready to launch.
- Right, I'm going.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.239
What really gets me
is how he thinks he can order me about.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.190
Well, he who lives by the rule book,
dies by the rule book.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.353
Can you hear us?
Listen, Lanstrom's got some holo-virus.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.511
She's totally barking!

08:07.160 --> 08:10.914
- Listy?
- We need back-up, man. We need it now.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.071
Everything OK?

08:14.120 --> 08:18.352
- What? Can't you hear me?
- I'm sorry, Lister, you're very faint.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.473
Dr Lanstrom has contracted
some mutated holo-plague

08:22.640 --> 08:25.632
and is in a fearful psychopathic fury.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.756
Marvellous!

08:29.040 --> 08:32.554
I'm sure she'll be a valuable asset
to the team.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.032
Sir, I'm going to change frequency.
Can you hear me now?

08:41.919 --> 08:48.359
Hello. My name is Dr Hildegarde Lanstrom
and I am quite, quite mad.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.876
Are you really? How absolutely splendid.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.310
I have a riddle for you.

08:54.480 --> 08:59.998
What's dead and dead and dead all over?

09:00.440 --> 09:03.000
Give in, Dr Fruit-Loop. Do tell me.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.072
You-oo!

09:11.280 --> 09:18.038
Well, we know what to get you for Christmas:
a lobotomy and 10 rolls of rubber wallpaper.

09:18.240 --> 09:22.074
Holly, I really must make tracks.
Keep me updated, will you?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.835
Where is she?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.389
I fear she's toying with us, sir.

09:40.560 --> 09:45.509
- What kind of disease gives her hex vision?
- Clearly some kind of psi-virus, sir.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.831
It appears to stimulate dormant areas of the brain,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.197
which, until now,
humankind has been unable to harness.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.114
Unfortunately, it requires so much energy,
it drains the victim's life-force.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.834
- That's why she was in stasis?
- Precisely.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.992
Lanstrom was preserving
what little lifespan remains her.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.233
Well, if she's running out of time,
let's give her the run-around.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.834
Theoretically, a sound notion, sir.
Unfortunately...

10:09.000 --> 10:12.629
Unfortunately, she has already found you.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.992
Twinkle, twinkle, little eye,

10:17.160 --> 10:21.233
now it's time for you to die.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.749
Poor woman. Destroyed by her own genius.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.230
- Genius?
- Yes. From what I've seen of her research,

10:36.400 --> 10:39.278
before the holo-virus,
she had a remarkable mind.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.433
If I'm right,
the fruits of her work should live on.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.714
- Anything?
- Quite extraordinary.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.158
Lanstrom postulated that there were
two kinds of virus - positive and negative.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.517
- The negative we know about.
- Flu, rabies, that stuff.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.316
But she also believed in positive viral
strains which make humans feel better.

11:03.480 --> 11:07.917
- Such as?
- Well, she predicted a kind of reverse flu,

11:08.080 --> 11:11.789
a virus which promotes
an unaccountable feeling of happiness.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.833
That's happened to me. My life's been crud,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.117
and I've woken up feeling good for no reason.

11:18.320 --> 11:23.440
The chances are, sir, that you had
unwittingly contracted Lanstrom's virus.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.230
According to her notes, 20th-century DJs
suffered from it all the time.

11:28.720 --> 11:34.238
- So what's in the tubes?
- Several isolated strains of positive virus.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.119
Inspiration, charisma, sexual magnetism...

11:37.320 --> 11:41.916
Sexual magnetism is a virus?
Get me to hospital, I'm a terminal case!

11:44.760 --> 11:47.718
This is the most intriguing.
According to her notes,

11:47.920 --> 11:52.436
this is the viral strain Felicitus populi,
commonly known as "luck. "

11:52.640 --> 11:54.995
- Luck is a virus?
- A positive virus,

11:55.160 --> 11:59.119
which most humans contract
at some point for very short periods.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.671
And here it is,
Lady Luck in liquid form. Want to try some?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.795
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely harmless.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.158
Even so, this minute dose
will only last for about three minutes.

12:12.480 --> 12:17.235
Now pick out all the aces
from this pack of cards.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.960
- Shuffle 'em?
- Mm-hmm.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.511
13 to 1.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.031
221 to 1.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.153
5,525 to 1.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.472
270,725 to 1.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.632
Sir, throw this dart over here
into that bull's-eye behind you

12:41.800 --> 12:44.075
using your left hand, without looking.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.710
Using my left hand?
Into the bulls-eye? Without looking?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.871
- No chance.
- Trust me, sir.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.071
You ready?

12:52.240 --> 12:57.758
Ah. I think that indicates
the luck virus has worn off.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.148
When you're quite finished,
we've got a problem with the doors.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.916
- What problem?
- They won't open.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.595
- Rimmer's put in an override.
- Welcome home, gentlemen.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.514
If you'd proceed to the aft to bay 47.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.597
That's quarantine!

13:15.800 --> 13:19.509
- Spot on.
- But, sir, I've screened us. We're clean.

13:19.720 --> 13:26.034
Well, much as I trust a viral screening
conducted by an automated toilet attendant,

13:26.200 --> 13:32.070
I really must draw your attention
to Space Corps Directive 595.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.829
- For cryin' out loud!
- I have no intention of contracting

13:36.000 --> 13:39.356
the hologrammatic equivalent
of foaming dog fever.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.035
So, gentlemen,
you may proceed to quarantine room 152,

13:43.200 --> 13:46.476
where you will be spending
the next three months.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.034
12 weeks. I have a dark sense
of foreboding about this.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.629
Oh, come on. We'll get through it.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.395
This is single quarters.
One chair, one bed, one shower.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.949
- We'll manage.
- Sir, it's a scientific fact

14:15.160 --> 14:18.038
that the human male needs time by himself.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.559
- It is?
- Hmm.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.269
The most popular pastimes
have always been enjoyed alone -

14:23.440 --> 14:26.955
angling, golf
and, of course, the all-time number one.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.229
It's not just humans.
When male tigers are locked up together,

14:32.400 --> 14:34.675
one winds up on the other's toothpick.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.839
Lions, tigers, scorpions, rats...
even vultures when they're in captivity.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.715
What are you saying to me?
Vultures need personal space?

14:42.880 --> 14:48.000
They need time alone to put their feet up
and read "What Carcass?" magazine?

14:48.200 --> 14:51.749
Sir, I think you're downplaying
the gravity of the situation.

14:51.960 --> 14:56.351
Look, we hang out together
most of the time together anyway.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.712
Yeah, but we could go at any time.
Not now, though.

15:00.920 --> 15:05.596
Welcome to quarantine, lads.
I hope the next 84 days pass as swiftly

15:05.760 --> 15:08.149
and pleasantly as the 100 Years' War.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.670
Sir, I must protest. You've only supplied
single-berth accommodation.

15:11.880 --> 15:17.637
Space Corps Directive 597 clearly states
"one berth per registered crew member".

15:17.800 --> 15:21.952
As Listy is the only registered
crew member, that's all you get.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.954
- Don't rise to him.
- What about entertainment?

15:25.160 --> 15:28.118
You are obliged to provide us
with leisure facilities.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.551
Games, literature,
hobby activities, motion pictures.

15:31.760 --> 15:36.515
And in accordance with Space Corps
Directive 312, you'll find in the cupboard

15:36.680 --> 15:39.797
a chess set with 31 missing pieces,

15:39.960 --> 15:44.238
a knitting magazine
with a pull-out special on crocheted hats,

15:44.400 --> 15:47.472
a puzzle magazine
with all the crosswords completed

15:47.640 --> 15:54.512
and a video of the excellent "Wallpapering,
Painting and Stippling - a DIY Guide".

15:54.720 --> 15:59.271
- Don't rise to him.
- And fulfilling all dietary requirements,

15:59.440 --> 16:03.433
dinner tonight, gentlemen,
will consist of sprout soup,

16:03.600 --> 16:06.194
followed by sprout salad,

16:06.400 --> 16:11.155
and for desert - I think you'll like it,
rather unusual - sprout crumble.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.875
Rimmer, you know damn well
sprouts make me chuck.

16:15.080 --> 16:19.870
Well, this is awful. I've got you down
for sprouts almost every meal.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.350
I tell a lie. It IS every meal.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.552
- How long are you going to keep this up?
- What?

16:27.720 --> 16:31.156
I'm merely executing Space Corps Directive 595.

16:31.320 --> 16:36.348
Anyway, must dasherooni. I've got to organise
your daily musical entertainment.

16:36.520 --> 16:42.038
I think you'll like it. It's a looped tape
of "Reggie Dixon's Tango Treats".

16:42.240 --> 16:44.800
OK. Time to rise to him. Let me at him!

16:46.800 --> 16:51.032
Listen, he wants us to annoy each other,
go through 12 weeks of hell.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.714
Well, we won't give him the satisfaction.

16:53.880 --> 16:59.034
The entire time, we're not gonna have
one single argument, not a cross word,

16:59.200 --> 17:02.670
not one angry exchange. OK? OK?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.910
Boys from the Dwarf.

17:19.680 --> 17:25.630
I think that's straight now. Two hours it's
taken to panel-beat my head back into shape.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.910
Two damn hours.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.873
Guys, just take it easy.

17:34.760 --> 17:41.552
If he says that once more, I'll turn his ears
into maracas and do a fandango on his throat.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.595
I'm just saying there's 79 more days to go.

17:46.800 --> 17:53.035
And if you want to be alive when there's
78 days to go, do not blow your nose.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.993
Do you mind if I ask why?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.998
Let's forego the noise
and revolting burbling sound

17:59.160 --> 18:02.948
and go straight to the really gross part,
when you always -

18:03.120 --> 18:05.998
and I mean always - having blown your nose,

18:06.160 --> 18:11.234
have to open up the handkerchief
and take a look at the contents.

18:11.400 --> 18:16.155
I mean, why?
What do you expect to see in there?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.590
A Turner seascape, perhaps?

18:19.680 --> 18:24.674
The face of the Madonna?
An undiscovered Shakespearean sonnet?

18:24.880 --> 18:28.190
Rimmer was right about you. You have changed.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.512
- You're getting tetchy.
- Oh, don't call me tetchy.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.750
You know what happens.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.037
Well, that's exactly what I'm calling you.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.192
Tetchy. Tetchy. Tetchy.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.678
It's just as well I can't hear you
calling me tetchy.

18:46.840 --> 18:50.150
You know what happens
when you call me tetchy.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.355
Oh, no! Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I warn you what would happen?

18:57.480 --> 18:59.471
- No.
- Yes. I'm putting it on.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.029
- Don't put it on.
- Here I go.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.351
- There he goes.
- Kryten, I'm not helping you again.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.080
- Not this time.
- You think I need help?

19:08.240 --> 19:12.552
I can extract my own head
from the waste disposal unit.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.480
It won't be the waste disposal, Frankenstein.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.029
I'm gonna microwave your head.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.471
Frankenstein was the creator,
not the monster.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.110
It's a common misconception,
held by all truly stupid people.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.834
Don't correct me. I hate being corrected.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.118
- It really gets my feckles up.
- It's "hackles", you moron.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.590
- There's no such word as "feckles".
- Feckles, hackles, schmeckles.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.149
Whatever they are, they're up now, buddy.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.470
- Yeah?
- Guys! Guys!

19:40.640 --> 19:44.519
Look at us! Five days on a sprout diet

19:44.680 --> 19:49.470
with a wallpapering video and a crochet
magazine and we've all turned into crazies.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.588
Just don't call me tetchy.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.910
- And don't correct me.
- OK.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.157
- OK.
- OK. We're going to get through this.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.312
Don't say we're going to get through this!

20:01.520 --> 20:04.478
That stupid chirpy optimism.
That inane winsome grin.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.629
This is insane! We've been here five days.

20:09.800 --> 20:14.271
- There's no sign of any virus. We're clean.
- That's it! We've got him.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.910
Space Corps Directive 699.
We can demand a rescreening.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.716
- He'll refuse.
- He's playing by the book. We've nailed him.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.555
Gentlemen... your
conversation makes interesting listening.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.109
- Rimmer, is that you?
- Oh, yes.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.797
- How long have you been listening?
- Two, maybe three hours.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.228
- No one's got any disease.
- We're clean.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.597
You have to re-screen us as per Directive 699.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.639
No one's got any virus
and no one's smeggin' nuts.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.956
Well, that's good.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.831
- Is something amiss?
- Amiss? No. What could possibly be amiss?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.156
You don't think there's anything amiss?

20:56.320 --> 21:00.154
I'm sitting here wearing a red and white
checked gingham dress...

21:00.320 --> 21:03.949
and army boots...
and you think that's un-amiss?

21:04.160 --> 21:08.233
No, we just thought you'd gone nuts.
We were humouring you.

21:08.400 --> 21:14.589
I was just doing a little test.
A little test to see if you had gone crazy.

21:17.640 --> 21:21.918
If there is one thing
I can't stand... it's crazy people.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.790
Well, we've passed the test.
You can let us out.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.116
- I can't let you out.
- Why not?

21:29.320 --> 21:33.199
The King of the Potato People won't let me.

21:34.680 --> 21:39.231
I begged him.
I got down on my knees and wept.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.910
He wants to keep you here...

21:44.000 --> 21:46.150
.. keep you here for ten years.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.311
Could we see him?

21:49.320 --> 21:51.151
- See who?
- The King.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.715
- Do you have a magic carpet?
- Yeah, a little three-seater.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.789
So, let me get this straight.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.999
You'll fly on a magic carpet
to the King of the Potato People...

22:06.000 --> 22:10.915
.. and plead with him for your freedom,
and you're telling me you are completely sane?

22:11.120 --> 22:17.309
I think that warrants two hours... of WOO.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.876
- What's WOO?
- You had to ask.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.239
With... out... oxygen.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.554
No oxygen for two hours.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.518
That'll teach you to be bread baskets.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.154
- What do we do?
- I think our only hope's the Potato King.

22:38.320 --> 22:42.871
- How did he get the holo-virus?
- It can be transmitted over radio waves.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.952
He must have spoken
to Lanstrom at some point.

22:46.160 --> 22:50.517
We have seven minutes
before the air in here becomes unbreathable.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.473
- We gotta get out of here.
- It's impossible.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.555
That's the whole point of quarantine.
Nothing gets out. Nothing gets in.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.518
Not even a microbe.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.912
Kryten, any chance of cracking the code?

23:05.120 --> 23:09.750
The chances of punching in the correct
combination are literally billions to one.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.632
- Unless...
- Of course!

23:11.840 --> 23:13.910
The luck virus!

23:14.600 --> 23:19.469
- You think that stuff'll work?
- If I give Mr Lister a large dose,

23:19.640 --> 23:23.428
he will temporarily become the luckiest human
being who ever lived.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.917
- OK. What do I do?
- Just press in whatever you think is best.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.633
OK.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.195
Last digit, sir.

23:43.640 --> 23:47.076
- So what now?
- We head for the hologram projection suite,

23:47.240 --> 23:50.038
- before Mr Rimmer...
- Before Mr Rimmer what?

23:52.720 --> 23:55.598
They've been naughty boys,
haven't they, Mr Flibble?

23:56.960 --> 23:58.632
Yes.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.236
What happens to boys
who've been naughty, Mr Flibble?

24:02.400 --> 24:06.359
Uncle Arnie fries them alive
with his hex vision.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.114
That's right, Mr Flibble.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.671
This way!

24:19.640 --> 24:22.074
The holo-virus is in its secondary stage.

24:22.240 --> 24:26.472
- Mr Rimmer can't have long to live.
- What is he capable of?

24:26.680 --> 24:29.399
Well, we've seen hex vision. Like Lanstrom,

24:29.560 --> 24:32.916
he'll be capable of telepathy, even telekinesis.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.116
Telekiny-what-inesis?

24:37.400 --> 24:41.837
The ability to move objects
purely by the power of the mind.

24:45.720 --> 24:51.272
- Kryten, are you OK?
- I have a medium-sized axe in my spine.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.749
That can put a crimp on your day.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.795
Two and one-half badgers, please!

25:05.200 --> 25:10.115
No, I'll eat them here.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.711
Ah, that's better. Now I can...

25:14.880 --> 25:17.713
win self-determination
for the Moldavian people!

25:23.280 --> 25:25.840
Ah, I think I'm OK now.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.155
Mr Flibble's very cross.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.551
You shouldn't have ran away from him.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.554
What are we going to do
with them, Mr Flibble?

25:49.440 --> 25:52.000
We can't possibly do that.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.949
Who'd clear up the mess?

25:57.880 --> 26:00.633
- We need to use your luck, sir.
- How?

26:00.800 --> 26:05.078
What we need is a remote link
to the hologram disk projection system.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.357
- Like this one?
- What a stroke of luck.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.273
Now we need a detachable
power transfer adapter

26:11.440 --> 26:14.352
capable of holding spikes of five million volts.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.511
What's this?

26:17.480 --> 26:22.349
Extraordinary.
Now all we need is a B47/7RF resistor.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.271
Look out!

26:33.320 --> 26:35.311
Mr Flibble says...

26:35.480 --> 26:37.710
Game over, boys.

27:00.080 --> 27:06.553
- I think he's going to be OK, sir.
- OK? The luck virus must have worn off.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.116
Rimmer? You OK?

27:12.320 --> 27:15.232
- What happened? Where am I?
- Quarantine.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.549
- But don't worry...
- We're here to entertain you!

27:30.040 --> 27:33.350
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

27:33.520 --> 27:36.796
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:36.960 --> 27:40.077
# Let me fly far away from here

27:40.240 --> 27:42.913
# Fun, fun, fun

27:43.080 --> 27:46.595
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:46.760 --> 27:50.116
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

27:50.280 --> 27:53.397
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:53.560 --> 27:56.757
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

27:56.920 --> 27:59.559
# Fun, fun, fun

27:59.720 --> 28:03.554
# In the sun, sun, sun

28:03.720 --> 28:06.359
# Fun, fun, fun

28:06.520 --> 28:10.752
# In the sun, sun, sun #
