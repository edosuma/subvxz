Because he doesn't exactly
look like a super-villain.

02:31.266 --> 02:35.069
We found him in a crater in
Central Park, talking crazy.

- Please, you have to protect me.

from here.

- Michael Korvac.

that this guy got abducted

Come on.

04:36.057 --> 04:39.226
You didn't see the look in his eyes.
He's scared.

04:39.261 --> 04:42.263
He's been going in and out
of consciousness.

04:42.297 --> 04:45.065
Jane and I have been able
to piece a lot of it together.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.335
He escaped from the alien ship,
but more aliens are chasing him.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.305
We think Michael's trying
to get back to Corrina.

04:51.339 --> 04:53.974
She could be his girlfriend,
or his wife.

04:54.009 --> 04:55.276
Who knows how long
he's been gone?

04:55.310 --> 04:59.113
Obviously Earth is of interest
to several alien races,

04:59.147 --> 05:02.216
but Mister Korvac's tale has problems.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.986
How could a normal man escape
from an advanced alien race,

05:06.021 --> 05:07.922
much less return to Earth?

05:07.956 --> 05:10.224
Well, when he wakes up,
we'll ask him.

05:10.258 --> 05:12.193
When he wakes up,
he's going to flip out.

05:12.227 --> 05:15.062
You realize you put
Mr. Abductee here in a med lab

05:15.096 --> 05:17.064
and strapped him to a table
to get examined.

05:17.098 --> 05:21.135
- Good thinking.
- Oh. Good point.

05:21.169 --> 05:23.137
Well, crazy or not, there's
a crater in Central Park.

05:23.171 --> 05:24.271
He didn't make that up.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.040
Hawkeye, Panther, go check it out.

05:26.074 --> 05:29.076
- I'll stay here with Jane and...
- I'm going to find Corrina.

05:29.110 --> 05:31.278
Uh, not exactly
what I was going to say.

05:31.313 --> 05:34.114
She's probably been
looking for him this whole time.

05:34.149 --> 05:36.984
We can use some facial
recognition thing-ama-jig

05:37.018 --> 05:39.153
and see if anyone put out
a missing persons alert on him.

05:39.187 --> 05:40.955
Because it's probably her.

05:43.225 --> 05:45.292
Okay, then.

05:59.107 --> 06:01.075
We found Michael Korvac.

06:04.012 --> 06:05.145
I still don't buy it.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.215
Maybe the guy did get taken
by little green men.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.017
Or blue.

06:10.051 --> 06:13.254
Stop it. What I'm saying is,
there's something off about this guy.

06:13.288 --> 06:15.756
Perhaps after weeks or even months

06:15.757 --> 06:18.225
of experimentation by alien creatures,

06:18.260 --> 06:20.227
anyone would be "off."

Now you're just being difficult
to mess with me.

You are right.

06:33.942 --> 06:36.210
Korvac.

06:45.768 --> 06:47.702
He seems okay, physically. 

06:47.736 --> 06:50.872
The scars on his back are rough,
though there's no internal damage.

06:50.906 --> 06:54.842
He's malnourished and dehydrated,
but here's where it gets strange.

06:54.877 --> 06:57.945
He's emitting some kind of energy,
something I've never seen before.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.714
Huh?

06:59.748 --> 07:03.584
Ha, sorry. I guess this is
a bit over your head.

07:03.619 --> 07:06.654
It's a form of cosmic radiation.

07:06.689 --> 07:11.826
What? It's not... 
Oh.

07:11.860 --> 07:15.563
There was residual
cosmic radiation at the sight.

07:15.597 --> 07:18.533
Uh, yeah. We found the same
kind of thing on Korvac.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.835
I've already contacted Ms. Marvel,
she's the SWORD liaison.

07:20.869 --> 07:23.638

07:23.672 --> 07:24.872
Where's Cap?

07:24.907 --> 07:27.575
I don't know.
He requested some time off.

14:21.823 --> 14:24.492
[grunts]

14:30.699 --> 14:35.503
[crying]

14:38.707 --> 14:40.541
[chuckles]

14:43.745 --> 14:47.748
I'm never going
to let them hurt me again.

14:53.699 --> 14:55.400
[panting] 

14:59.508 --> 15:02.440
No, Jan. Jan!

15:02.474 --> 15:05.443
Wake up, please.

15:05.477 --> 15:08.479
[sobbing]

15:14.353 --> 15:15.520
Ha!
[grunts]

15:16.689 --> 15:19.357
[strains]

15:21.527 --> 15:23.661
[gasps]

15:23.696 --> 15:25.597
[grunts]

15:30.569 --> 15:31.669
[cries out]

15:52.491 --> 15:55.493
[gasps]

15:55.527 --> 15:59.664
<i>Iron Man? Hawkeye?</i>

15:59.698 --> 16:01.466
[groans]
Hulk!

16:04.286 --> 16:05.520
[groans]

16:05.554 --> 16:09.648
I've been here.

16:09.702 --> 16:14.162
- This is not Wakanda.
- T'Challa.

16:14.196 --> 16:18.199
Where are we?
What's happening?

16:18.234 --> 16:20.201
What the heck is going on here?

16:20.236 --> 16:22.203
[Rocket Raccoon]
What's going on here

16:22.238 --> 16:25.306
is that you ape-people
need to knock this off.

16:25.341 --> 16:28.309
Quasar, do something about this.

16:32.414 --> 16:34.415
Adam, hear me.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.188
Okay, enough!
I want answers.

16:40.222 --> 16:43.158
Who are you people?
Who is Michael Korvac?

16:43.192 --> 16:44.359
And where are we?

16:44.393 --> 16:47.228
And why can you weird aliens
speak English now?

16:47.263 --> 16:50.265
We are speaking mind to mind
through the power

16:50.299 --> 16:52.100
of Adam Warlock's soul gem.

16:53.336 --> 16:57.005
Okay, that probably
didn't help explain things.

16:57.039 --> 17:01.176
Look, my name is Peter Quill,
I'm the leader of the Guardians.

17:01.210 --> 17:04.212
He's the Star-Lord.
Respect him!

17:04.246 --> 17:06.047
[sighs]
Rocket...

17:06.082 --> 17:09.084
We're an intergalactic
peacekeeping force.

17:09.117 --> 17:11.987
We work together to keep
the known galaxies stable.

17:12.021 --> 17:15.991
Guardians of the Galaxy.
Sort of like Space Avengers.

17:16.025 --> 17:17.291
This is Quasar.

17:17.326 --> 17:21.096
Mister Personality here
is Rocket Raccoon.

17:21.130 --> 17:23.131
The big tree is Groot.

17:23.165 --> 17:26.334
I am Groot.

17:26.368 --> 17:29.104
Any time there's
an imbalance detected,

17:29.138 --> 17:31.656
thanks to Warlock here, we intervene

17:31.657 --> 17:34.175
and deal with the situation,
whatever it may be.

17:34.210 --> 17:37.145
And in this case, it's Korvac.

17:37.179 --> 17:40.215
He's a threat bigger
than anything we've ever seen.

17:40.249 --> 17:42.050
From what we have discovered,

17:42.084 --> 17:45.153
it appears he was a Kree
test subject that escaped.

17:45.187 --> 17:48.323
We're familiar with the Kree.

17:48.357 --> 17:51.026
<i>[Quasar] Whatever the
Kree did, it changed him.</i>

17:52.361 --> 17:56.097
<i>A latent genetic potential
within humanity perhaps.</i>

17:56.132 --> 17:57.332
[cries out]

17:57.366 --> 18:01.002
<i>They had never seen
anything like it.</i>

18:01.037 --> 18:02.937
[grunts]

18:02.972 --> 18:05.106
<i>The Kree ship was destroyed.</i>

18:05.141 --> 18:07.175
<i>[Star Lord] By the time
we caught wind of it all,</i>

18:07.209 --> 18:10.245
<i>Korvac somehow had ended up
on a space station.</i>

18:10.279 --> 18:12.113
<i>He destroyed it, too,</i>

18:12.148 --> 18:14.983
<i>along with a chunk
of the planet's surface below.</i>

18:15.017 --> 18:18.319
<i>A Rigellian Recorder caught
an image of Korvac in space,</i>

18:18.354 --> 18:22.090
<i>just hovering in the debris
laughing.</i>

18:22.124 --> 18:23.224
And then he disappeared.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.226
We've been tracking
his energy signature

18:25.261 --> 18:29.164
across the galaxy,
finally to here, Earth.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.232
I can feel him.

18:31.267 --> 18:36.337
Korvac's power grows,
as does his madness.

18:36.372 --> 18:38.106
He would have destroyed us all,

18:38.140 --> 18:40.241
had I not pulled us
into the Soul Gem.

18:40.276 --> 18:43.344
- Can we beat him?
- Not physically.

18:43.379 --> 18:46.147
Our plan was to keep him
occupied long enough

18:46.182 --> 18:49.250
to let Warlock pull him
in here, into the Soul Gem.

18:49.285 --> 18:52.287
You may have noticed
but it didn't work out so well.

18:52.321 --> 18:57.358
So wait, if we're in here,
where's Korvac?

19:01.330 --> 19:04.065
[grunts]

19:17.179 --> 19:18.313
[cries out]

19:21.350 --> 19:24.252
You're one of them, aren't you?
The Kree.

19:24.286 --> 19:27.322
You've come to take me,
but I won't let you!

19:27.356 --> 19:29.124
[grunts]

19:33.362 --> 19:35.130
No. That's not possible.

19:35.164 --> 19:40.301
Michael, we can help you.
But you have to stop this.

19:40.336 --> 19:43.271
No, no, no, no, no.
What they did to me,

19:43.305 --> 19:46.007
I won't let that happen again,
not to anyone.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.209
And now, I can stop them!

19:48.244 --> 19:51.179
I can feel the power inside of me.

19:51.213 --> 19:53.014
Now!

19:55.251 --> 19:57.252
[grunts]

20:04.994 --> 20:07.228
[strains]

20:10.199 --> 20:12.233
[grunts]

20:16.005 --> 20:17.138
[grunts]

20:17.173 --> 20:20.975
Korvac, we can protect you from
the Kree, if you stop fighting us.

20:21.010 --> 20:24.078
You lie!

20:24.113 --> 20:26.014
Warlock, now!

20:29.018 --> 20:31.252
No.
Nooo!

20:35.224 --> 20:38.159
[cries]

20:38.494 --> 20:40.228
Corrina?

20:40.262 --> 20:45.133
Please, Michael, stop.
You're scaring me.

20:45.167 --> 20:49.037
Scared of me?

20:49.071 --> 20:51.272
No, Corrina,
I'm going to protect you.

20:51.307 --> 20:57.045
I'm doing all of this for you.
To make the monsters go away.

20:57.079 --> 21:00.281
You're the only monster here,
Michael.

21:00.316 --> 21:03.218
[gasps]

21:03.252 --> 21:06.254
No. Stop him!

21:13.295 --> 21:18.299
[sobs]

21:18.334 --> 21:21.169
Warlock, what happened?

21:21.203 --> 21:26.007
He sensed the woman's fear
of him, her doubt in him.

21:26.041 --> 21:31.179
And despite all his power, all he
truly wanted was to be with her.

21:31.213 --> 21:34.115
Where is Korvac?

21:34.149 --> 21:37.318
I cannot sense him
on this plane of existence.

21:37.353 --> 21:42.156
If this is the kind of thing the
Guardians deal with, then we should talk.

21:42.191 --> 21:45.093
Yeah, I don't think so.

21:45.127 --> 21:47.262
There are things out there
in the universe

21:47.296 --> 21:50.932
you're better off not knowing about.
