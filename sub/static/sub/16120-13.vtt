WEBVTT

00:06.370 --> 00:10.500
* He's the curtain *

00:10.540 --> 00:15.307
* Closes on your eyes

00:15.340 --> 00:19.276
* You embrace the light

00:21.420 --> 00:23.308
* I stay high

00:29.230 --> 00:35.191
* Can I love you

00:35.230 --> 00:41.191
* Like I used to?

00:41.240 --> 00:43.834
* Like I used to.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.033
( harmonizing )

00:48.740 --> 00:51.470
( music plays )

00:51.510 --> 00:53.569
* Dreams never die,
take flight *

00:53.620 --> 00:55.269
* As the world turns

00:55.320 --> 00:57.288
* Keep the colors
in the line *

00:57.320 --> 00:59.208
* Take flight,
as the world turns *

00:59.260 --> 01:01.285
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:01.320 --> 01:03.686
* Take flight

01:03.730 --> 01:05.584
* Dreams never die

01:11.330 --> 01:13.491
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:15.340 --> 01:17.228
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:17.270 --> 01:18.498
* Take flight.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.528
Hi. How was
your flight?

01:42.170 --> 01:45.264
He needs his father,
Davis.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.632
It's important
that you're around,
especially now,

01:47.670 --> 01:49.865
when you're
not playing...

01:49.910 --> 01:52.879
I would think
you would use this time
to rebuild with him.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.674
Charley,
I always want
to be there for him.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.143
But the fact
of the matter is,

01:57.180 --> 01:59.910
my time is about to get
a lot more limited.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.510
I'm signing
with a new team
this weekend.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.789
- What new team?
- New York.

02:08.660 --> 02:11.356
Me and Felix,
back at it.

02:11.390 --> 02:15.292
One more shot
at that fifth ring.
Like we always said.

02:21.740 --> 02:22.866
I'm proud of you.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.503
You'll make it happen,
Davis.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.703
You always do.
It's yours.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.542
You mean that?

02:34.580 --> 02:35.717
Of course I do.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.828
For whatever's happened
between us,

02:44.860 --> 02:47.590
two things are sure.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.463
You'll always be
Micah's father.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.709
And I'll always be
your biggest fan.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.946
I don't know
what to say, Charley.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.618
Come have a good talk
with Micah

03:06.650 --> 03:07.969
before you take off
to New York.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.614
Meet us
at the High Yellow?

03:10.650 --> 03:12.288
6:00 p.m.?

03:12.320 --> 03:14.857
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.858
( door closes )

03:22.730 --> 03:24.698
( phone dials )

03:24.730 --> 03:26.630
( phone rings )

03:34.880 --> 03:36.347
Hello?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.575
I'm surprised
you picked up, Lena.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.749
I thought we had
an agreement.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.578
But I see you decided
to put your dirty laundry
in the street instead.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.986
Lena:
No, I've decided
to call your bluff.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.578
Excuse me?

03:47.620 --> 03:50.327
Look, you can't play
that tape to anyone,

03:50.360 --> 03:51.782
even if you do have it.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.024
Which I doubt you do.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.992
if you're caught
leaking it.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.861
But I know you.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.697
You're way too careful
for that.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.008
You poor thing.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.339
You don't know the half.
So, yeah...

04:07.380 --> 04:09.940
good luck with whatever
you thi you're doing.

04:09.980 --> 04:14.019
Just try not to mess up
your man's career any more
than you already have.

04:14.050 --> 04:14.948
( phone clicks off)

04:17.790 --> 04:20.258
( phone dials )

04:22.460 --> 04:24.758
- Frank Rovner.
- Frank.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.655
Charley Bordelon-West
here.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.922
I don't know
what to say.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.893
"Thanks" don't feel
big enough.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.362
You don't have to say
anything.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.900
But I want to.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.637
Thanks for being involved
in all this, you know.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.773
You didn't have to do that.
You didn't have to do
none of it.

04:43.810 --> 04:47.769
I looked out for you,
like good people
looked out for me.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.539
Now you got to do the same
for somebody else.
That's the cycle.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.389
I hear you.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.910
I think
you gonna dig Montgomery.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.520
The Mayes live 10 minutes
from the community college

04:57.560 --> 05:00.358
and my girl Jina's
got that library job
all worked out.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.327
I won't let you down.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.964
I already know that.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.093
Got some fruit
for the road.

05:08.140 --> 05:11.405
Couple of succulent plants
for your new room.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.805
And veggie seeds.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.604
Plant them somewhere.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.700
It feels good
to watch them grow.
I promise.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.722
- I got him.
- I know.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.638
Be safe on the road.

05:41.670 --> 05:42.864
You bet.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.980
( computer keys
clacking )

06:02.020 --> 06:03.453
( cellphone vibrates )

06:03.490 --> 06:04.650
( beeps )

06:04.690 --> 06:05.987
Man over phone:
Hi, beautiful.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.657
Hi, you.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.123
- ( Nova giggles )
- You busy writing?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.058
Yeah, but I want
to talk to you.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.931
- You want to talk...
- Mm-hm.

06:13.970 --> 06:15.597
or do you want
to see me?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.608
( chuckles )
Do I have a choice?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.437
Why don't you look
out your window?

06:27.780 --> 06:33.753
* A little bit of love
goes a long way *

06:33.790 --> 06:39.751
* But is it enough
to make you stay? *

06:39.800 --> 06:43.759
* How do you say
for yesterday? *

06:43.800 --> 06:46.098
* But it's all right *

06:46.130 --> 06:50.408
* 'Cause a little bit
of love goes a long way. *

07:02.690 --> 07:05.716
I'm so sorry.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.049
For everything.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.955
Me, too.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.423
Iam.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.999
God, I just want
to breathe you in.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.067
- Come inside.
- No.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.534
I want to do things
different.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.128
Better.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.433
Okay.

07:29.910 --> 07:32.572
I want to take you
out for dinner,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.679
and drinks,

07:34.720 --> 07:36.017
and dancing...

07:36.050 --> 07:38.109
in public.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.854
Yes.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.478
We can do that.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.589
Your mother and I
want you to know
that you

07:51.630 --> 07:54.861
have always been
and will always be
our first priority.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.131
No matter
what's gomg on
between us.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.968
Look, I know
it's been rough.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.740
But I want us to try
to be like we were.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.805
You know, you and me.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.588
Can you say something,
son?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.588
Tell me _
what you're feeling.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.258
I feel like I don't
want to be here having
this conversation.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.256
- To be honest.
- Micah.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.860
- Your father's trying.
- You're falling for this?

08:24.900 --> 08:26.265
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.632
Now, you will not
be disrespectful.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.137
You can be mad
and you can be hurt,

08:30.170 --> 08:32.263
but you're not gonna talk
to your mother like that.

08:32.310 --> 08:34.631
No, you don't get
to tell me what I will
or won't do anymore.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.645
I'm sorry, but no.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.911
I don't believe you.

08:40.950 --> 08:43.282
I don't believe
anything you say.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.015
I don't believe
you care about me.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.813
You don't.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.321
You don't love me.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.658
You sure don't love Mom.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.798
The only thing
you care about is yourself.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.032
I'm not falling
for anything, Micah,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.298
but I will believe
your father

09:11.350 --> 09:13.011
if he proves himself.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.541
Prove to your son
what you say is true.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.656
Frank Rovner, Davis West.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.920
It's good to see you
again, Davis.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.689
You, too.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.919
I want to win.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.963
I want to build
a championship team,
Davis. Quickly.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.608
And I need a champion
to do that.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.335
I want to invest
In you.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.144
You want that fifth ring.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.343
Everybody knows that.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.109
And you need
a quick rebuild to get it.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.983
And we can do that.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.614
In New York,
it's a media cesspool,

09:54.660 --> 09:57.151
just waiting
to take you down.

09:57.190 --> 10:01.229
But NOLA press
and New Orleans Stingers fans

10:01.260 --> 10:03.160
will embrace you.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.636
Especially with Charley
and Micah by your side.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.124
I'm in.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.297
( chuckles )

10:33.330 --> 10:35.298
All right.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.778
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.914
Where is everybody?

10:56.950 --> 10:59.987
I wanted you to stop by
a little early.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.409
Okay.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.724
( chuckles )

11:06.930 --> 11:08.955
Uh...

11:09.000 --> 11:10.922
What are we doing?

11:12.470 --> 11:14.335
You're listening...

11:19.510 --> 11:21.375
and I'm apologizing.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.903
Oh...

11:24.950 --> 11:27.168
- This is the apology?
- Mm-hmm.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.369
For forgetting our date?

11:28.420 --> 11:30.183
Yes.

11:30.220 --> 11:34.054
- This is my apology...
- Uh-huh.

11:34.090 --> 11:36.012
- Mm.
- for forgetting...

11:39.860 --> 11:42.693
our first date.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.239
I'm sorry.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.099
Mm.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.869
I love these
L.A. apologies.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.218
( both laugh )

12:02.250 --> 12:04.787
You can stand me up
more often, if you want.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.314
Nope.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.157
Never again.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.098
Well...

12:23.140 --> 12:26.359
I have something
to apologize for, too.

12:26.410 --> 12:29.004
I slipped
during a conversation
with Ralph Angel.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.768
And I mentioned the mill.

12:35.550 --> 12:36.881
Sorry.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.258
Look, I know it wasn't
my place to tell him,

12:48.300 --> 12:51.292
but he does have a right
to know.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.560
When he knows

12:53.600 --> 12:57.001
should have been
my choice.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.133
The deal isn't done yet.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.037
Ralph Angel is--
he's immature.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.401
I just wanted everything
to be sorted

13:04.450 --> 13:07.146
before I told anyone,
especially him.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.149
I don't think you see
what everyone else sees.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.818
Ralph Angel's
really stepped up.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.011
He researched
that refrigerated truck
strategy well.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.925
So, you don't want me
to buy the mill.

13:19.930 --> 13:23.161
You already have
one business that isn't
even off the ground.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.169
We haven't had
one harvest.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.134
- ( sighs )
- Hey.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.508
Hey.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.179
Whether I agree
with you or not,

13:35.210 --> 13:37.201
I'm here to support you.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.104
I called the meeting.

13:39.150 --> 13:42.176
Most of the famers
have agreed to come
to hear you out

13:42.220 --> 13:43.812
about the mill.

13:47.090 --> 13:49.479
So, I present
a workable,

13:49.520 --> 13:53.126
realistic plan
with the trucks
and the out-of-town mill

13:53.160 --> 13:55.094
and all that
just gets ignored

13:55.130 --> 13:58.122
while you do
your own thing?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.092
Since when do I_haye
to ask your permissmn

14:00.140 --> 14:02.461
to pursue
a business opportunity?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.867
Since you plan
to use our farm
as the first account.

14:05.910 --> 14:09.368
Probably a good idea
to run that by the owners,
no?

14:09.410 --> 14:11.401
And whether you like it
or not,

14:11.450 --> 14:14.476
that includes me
and Nova.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.886
Listen, you should have
made sure we knew.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.478
No doubt.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.648
We need to know
what you're doing
before you do it.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.055
Penod.

14:26.530 --> 14:29.624
But that being said,

14:29.660 --> 14:32.197
this is a badass deal.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.360
And I'm proud as hell

14:37.410 --> 14:39.139
for you trying
to pull it off.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.148
( scoffs )

14:45.180 --> 14:47.114
Can you imagine

14:47.150 --> 14:48.970
a black woman

14:49.020 --> 14:52.148
owning and operating
her own mill?

14:52.190 --> 14:53.680
Come on, what?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.052
It's crazy.
Congratulations!

14:56.090 --> 14:58.058
Thank you.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.524
Really-- you know,
this is like--
why didn't you tell me?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.994
- I mean--
- I wanted to tell you,
I really wanted to.

15:03.030 --> 15:05.419
- I really wanted to.
- No, I know.
Things have been a little--

15:05.470 --> 15:08.530
I'm down with
this sisterhood
and all that,

15:08.570 --> 15:10.333
I really am.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.167
But I got Blue
to think about.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.207
What makes you think
the refineries

15:17.250 --> 15:20.014
will still give you
the same bump as
the Boudreauxs?

15:20.050 --> 15:23.213
The crop advisor
told us how much
our haul was worth.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.946
Bottom line is,

15:25.990 --> 15:28.618
you're gambling
with our money, Charley.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.423
That mill will probably
take, what,

15:30.460 --> 15:33.497
six months _
to get up and running?

15:33.530 --> 15:35.555
Let's just make a deal
at St. James now.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.194
Our first harvest,
see how it goes.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.095
You can do
your mill thing
next year.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.062
I'll get the mill
up and running.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.362
There's no gamble
for you.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.207
If it doesn't work out,

15:45.240 --> 15:48.334
I will pay
the crop advisor's
estimate myself.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.210
A sugar mill don't run
on 200 acres of cane.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.047
How you gonna convince
20 farmers

15:55.080 --> 15:57.082
to drop everything
and grind with you?

15:57.120 --> 16:00.351
I already set
an emergency community
trust meeting.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.321
Ralph Angel,
if it happens,

16:06.360 --> 16:10.126
it could actually wind up
being a game changer
for this community.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.126
It'd do a lot of good
for a lot of people

16:12.170 --> 16:14.661
in the long run.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.464
Why can't you do
what we agreed to?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.205
What Daddy wanted?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.470
He wanted to win.

16:21.510 --> 16:23.341
Which takes more
than seed cane

16:23.380 --> 16:26.076
and refrigerated trucks,
Ralph Angel.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.613
It takes beating
these people at their own
warped game.

16:28.650 --> 16:32.279
It's a whole system!
Why can't you see that?

16:32.320 --> 16:34.550
We can't play it small.

16:34.590 --> 16:37.388
This is exactly
what Daddy wanted.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.754
- You're wrong.
- Okay.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.462
Everybody ain't playing games
like you, Charley.

16:46.470 --> 16:51.032
Pops wanted to live
on his own two feet.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.504
He wanted to work
his land

16:53.540 --> 16:57.249
and bring in enough
so he could do it again
the next year.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.579
( scoffs )
He wasn't trying
to build no empire.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.508
Don't put this on him.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.087
This... is all about you.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.778
With all due respect,
Ralph Angel,

17:08.820 --> 17:10.481
this is happening.

17:12.090 --> 17:16.129
I need you
to be on board.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.266
Go ahead.
Do It.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.063
Y'all gather your famers,

17:21.100 --> 17:23.204
see how many decide
to leave the Boudreauxs

17:23.240 --> 17:25.561
just to play your games
with you.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.802
Good luck with that.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.705
Y'all excuse me.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.844
Ralph Angel?

17:37.890 --> 17:38.845
Ralph Angel--

17:38.890 --> 17:40.357
Please, Aunt Vi.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.550
I don't want to hear
none of that.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.353
This ain't about that.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.688
Y'all will fuss and fight
however you see fit.

17:45.730 --> 17:49.359
I'm asking after
Hollywood.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.095
He left St. Jo.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.632
What?

17:53.670 --> 17:55.695
( sighs )

17:55.740 --> 17:57.435
All that Charley drama,

17:57.470 --> 17:59.358
I forgot to give you
these.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.731
His divorce papers
from Leanne.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.840
Got to the farm
day after he left.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.474
That's what
he was waiting for.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.114
He didn't want
to come to you
empty-handed.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.447
He was trying
to come correct.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.583
Well, why didn't
he just say that?

18:14.620 --> 18:16.110
He tried to.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.723
Where is he,
Ralph Angel?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.398
Went and caught a shift
on the rig.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.762
Said he was gonna rent
a place somewhere.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.728
How long
has he been gone?

18:27.770 --> 18:29.738
Right after he saw you

18:29.770 --> 18:32.307
grinding on some man
at The Juke.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.555
( cell phone rings )

19:01.940 --> 19:02.895
Hey, Vi.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.909
Hey, Hollywood.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.805
I'm glad you picked up.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.432
I need to talk to you.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.268
Ain't nothing left
to say, Vi.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.539
I know about the divorce.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.684
I should have--
I should have listened
to you.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.258
I-- I was having
a problem with trust.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.520
I understand.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.198
I did the damage,
now I got to pay
the price.

19:28.230 --> 19:29.390
I get that.

19:29.430 --> 19:30.863
But we can fix that.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.789
Well, that's what
I was trying to do.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.330
I know, I know.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.464
I just--
I just needed time.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.808
Yeah, now I need time.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.603
Hollywood,

19:42.640 --> 19:45.677
that man ain't nobody
and nothing happened.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.849
It was just a dance.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.343
I took a long haul.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.179
How long?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.928
Why did you go
and do that?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.927
I got to go, Vi.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.378
( phone beeps off)

20:15.780 --> 20:18.908
Let's add a nose.
And some shades...

20:18.950 --> 20:21.316
Miss Velez taught us
all of the colors.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.648
Oh, yeah?
Did you learn your name?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.248
- Yup! Azul.
' (gasps)

20:25.290 --> 20:27.884
- Azul?
- Hey, I like that.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.718
You know, I'm gonna start
calling you "Azul"
from now on.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.784
Pop, no!

20:31.830 --> 20:32.785
- Yeah, I love it.
- Yes!

20:32.830 --> 20:34.320
Azul Bordelon.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.622
Darla:
I think it's perfect.
I love it.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.764
No, you guys!

20:37.800 --> 20:39.620
- Yeah, that's it.
That's it, that's it.
- Yes, you guys.

20:39.670 --> 20:40.989
I'm gonna start coloring
this one in.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.894
Babe, you better hurry.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.534
It's almost time
for that community trust
meeting thing.

20:47.510 --> 20:50.502
No. I ain't going.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.371
- I'm good.
- What do you mean?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.877
She don't respect me
in no way.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.287
Don't respect nothing
I say or do.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.515
I just got to accept it.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.950
Ain't no point
in sitting up there,
acting like I have a say.

21:07.530 --> 21:10.624
It's not about her
respecting you.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.537
- ( sighs )
- Respect yourself.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.739
You always know
what to say.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.789
I love you.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.629
I love you, too.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.989
What I'm proposing
is a collaborative,

21:46.030 --> 21:48.794
where we stand together
and advance together.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.104
It doesn't have to be
the way It's always been.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.007
I'm investing the capital
to purchase the mill.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.736
And for every farm
that joins me,

21:56.780 --> 21:58.941
in the inaugural harvest
this year,

21:58.980 --> 22:02.438
I'll pay the contract penalty
with the current mill,

22:02.480 --> 22:05.711
plus a bonus of 5%
on top of your bottom line.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.512
It's a risk.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.948
I'm an outsider.

22:12.990 --> 22:16.596
And... it's a risk.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.964
There will be bumps
along the way.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.606
But I invite your feedback
on everything.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.437
Help me build this.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.745
Tell me what we need
to do to thrive.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.916
We want to win
for all those who lost.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.884
For all the people
who came before us,

22:38.920 --> 22:40.615
who struggled,

22:40.660 --> 22:43.379
and strained,

22:43.430 --> 22:45.523
so we_could be here
right now,

22:45.560 --> 22:48.028
making this decision,
making it better.

22:48.060 --> 22:50.620
It's our turn to try.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.893
They risked for us.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.931
Why can't we do the same?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.512
( chattering )

23:14.060 --> 23:15.618
Man:
We got this together.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.581
I want change.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.689
( chattering continues )

23:24.530 --> 23:25.497
Appreciate that,
thank you.

23:25.530 --> 23:30.069
Yes, sir.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.829
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.201
Thank you, too.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.798
Thank you.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.070
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.545
I appreciate you.

23:43.080 --> 23:43.978
Good, good to see you.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.985
Charley:
Thanks for organizing that.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.420
Remy:
Hey, that was
a good meeting.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.004
I'd say,
"Your place or mine?"

24:04.040 --> 24:05.928
But I don't have a place.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.074
( laughing )

24:08.110 --> 24:10.806
My place it is, then.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.499
( phone vibrates )

24:17.280 --> 24:19.783
I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.848
Hello?

24:26.890 --> 24:28.949
Davis over phone:
I need to talk to you.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.719
- What's wrong?
- I need to see you.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.159
I need to know
that what happened today
is real.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.259
Frank seemed
very authentic to me,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.700
and he's already
forwarded a proposal.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.002
It's real as real can be.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.235
Charley. I mean us.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.976
I just need to know.

24:45.010 --> 24:47.843
Davis, I'm--

24:47.880 --> 24:49.711
I just did what
I felt in the moment.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.742
Can it be more
than a moment,
is what I'm asking.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.918
Are you willing
to try again, Charley?

24:55.960 --> 24:57.825
Is that possible?

25:02.230 --> 25:05.267
Yes, it's possible.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.598
Come see me, baby.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.937
I need you, Charley.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.608
I need to know_
we can be us again

25:10.640 --> 25:15.077
before we close
this deal.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.078
Charley?

25:19.350 --> 25:21.079
I'm on my way.

25:32.260 --> 25:35.252
I can come by later,
if you want.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.192
Is that okay?

25:41.670 --> 25:42.830
No.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.735
No, it isn't.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.602
Night, Charley.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.785
Davis:
I knew it.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.323
I knew it.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.989
I know you, Charley.

27:19.030 --> 27:21.999
You know, I don't know
what angles you're playing.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.905
I've been trying
to figure it out,

27:23.940 --> 27:26.158
but you're always
five steps ahead of me

27:26.210 --> 27:28.201
so who the hell knows,
huh?

27:31.450 --> 27:35.113
I always knew deep down
that this was never
gonna happen again.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.657
I'm not signing here.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.927
Sign for Micah.

27:50.970 --> 27:54.167
He doesn't want me,
Charley.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.088
I'm no good for him
right now.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.062
He's better with just you

27:58.110 --> 27:59.805
and the family.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.971
One day it will be better,
just not right now.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.948
How did we get here?

28:31.970 --> 28:34.302
I loved you so much.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.244
I gave you every ounce...

28:40.780 --> 28:42.975
of everything
inside of me.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.415
Every dream.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.854
Everything.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.259
You were the world...

29:02.340 --> 29:04.900
and every star in the slq
to me.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.875
Unconditionally.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.210
And now...

29:15.950 --> 29:19.545
you're one of those men.

29:19.590 --> 29:23.458
Too old to be out
playing the field
but don't even know it.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.990
Thinking you're cool,

29:28.030 --> 29:31.295
while everyone is quietly
laughing behind your back.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.835
It didn't
have to be this way.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.342
But we all make
our chonces, don't we?

30:04.230 --> 30:06.266
( rhythmic music
Playing )

30:16.140 --> 30:18.040
Felix Evans.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.948
You're so easy
to find because
you're so predictable.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.379
What are you doing here?

30:23.420 --> 30:26.048
I could ask you
the same question.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.058
But, then again,

30:28.090 --> 30:30.456
Lena doesn't much care
what you do these days,
does she?

30:30.490 --> 30:33.220
Because if she did,

30:33.260 --> 30:37.094
she would have been smart
and taken my offer
the first time.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.996
You know all about it,
I assume.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.237
- Yeah.
- Well, she was wrong.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.329
Leaking that tape
of Milena's deposition

30:46.370 --> 30:48.531
about you raping her
wasn't a threat.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.639
It's a fact.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.001
That tape will be
everywhere tomorrow

30:53.050 --> 30:55.109
if you don't handle
this conversation correctly.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.149
Look, I don't want
trouble, all right?

30:58.190 --> 31:01.011
- Good. I don't either.
Thank you.
- Champagne?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.016
I'm happy to turn fact
to fiction,

31:03.060 --> 31:04.880
but that's up to you.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.148
I'm not playing
in New Orleans, Charley.

31:09.060 --> 31:12.029
Renetta Miller.
Cheryl Amador.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.233
Caprice Littlejohn.
LaLette Green.

31:15.270 --> 31:16.567
- Who?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.363
You probably
know them as

31:18.410 --> 31:21.106
Black Diamond,
Spanish Rose,

31:21.140 --> 31:24.143
Luclq,
and... Sweet Tea?

31:26.950 --> 31:28.577
They're all ready
to talk.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.010
- You bluffing.
- Am I?

31:33.050 --> 31:35.052
How do you know?

31:35.090 --> 31:38.981
Let's just say
Milena Galoudian
isn't "Goldie" anymore.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.328
Now she's _a woman
on a mnssnon.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.998
A mission I support.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.999
See, she can't talk
about the settlement,

31:46.030 --> 31:47.566
but these
other women can.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.329
But I didn't do
nothing crazy with them.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.008
Mm. "Crazy."

31:51.040 --> 31:55.579
"Crazy" is in the eye
of the beholder.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.999
But we can let the police
and the press

31:58.050 --> 31:59.074
help you
figure that out.

32:03.250 --> 32:06.549
Listen, Felix,

32:06.590 --> 32:08.683
you still have choices.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.154
You can play for the Stingers
here in NOLA,

32:11.190 --> 32:13.181
for a fair price,

32:13.230 --> 32:15.425
and I'll make
those names go away.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.020
Or, you can ignore
my advice

32:18.070 --> 32:19.697
and go to New York

32:19.730 --> 32:21.630
and see what happens
when women

32:21.670 --> 32:23.535
start coming
out of the woodwork.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.108
The smart choice

32:27.140 --> 32:30.473
is to take the best deal
you can get.

32:30.510 --> 32:33.240
Tell New York
you won't Sign
if they take Davis.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.087
And wire $5 Mil
into the account
that I provide.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.246
Five million?

32:39.290 --> 32:41.178
Five mil
is doable for you.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.984
I know the ins and outs
of all of your endorsements.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.453
Before you were dropped,
you made a very tidy sum.

32:46.490 --> 32:48.458
Oh, this is happening.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.058
And it's happening now.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.624
I need this resolved

32:51.670 --> 32:54.594
before your afternoon flight
to New York tomorrow.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.494
So, just nod,

32:56.540 --> 32:58.269
and I can get the hell
out of here.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.371
Good.

33:04.410 --> 33:06.640
I'll text you
the account details.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.338
Oh.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.746
And if you ever
violate a woman again,

33:12.790 --> 33:15.258
Felix Evans,
I swear to God,

33:15.290 --> 33:17.554
you'll have hell to pay.

33:17.590 --> 33:20.718
I will personally
see to it.

33:41.550 --> 33:44.348
- ( sighs )
- ( cell phone rings )

33:50.820 --> 33:52.287
It's Charley.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.059
Frank Rovner, Charley.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.590
Thank you
for keeping your word.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.655
Davis's deal _
closed this morning.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.793
And I keep my word.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.060
The $5 million
will be in your account
by end of week.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.467
( whis
pe
Yes! rs )

34:05.510 --> 34:07.603
Actually, Frank,

34:07.640 --> 34:10.279
I'll need you to wire
$4 million to me

34:10.310 --> 34:12.449
and $1 million
to the nonprofit
of my choice.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.448
I know
you're good at this,

34:14.480 --> 34:16.619
but I end up getting
a tax deduction
out of the whole thing,

34:16.650 --> 34:20.086
I am personally starting
the Charley Bordelon-West
fan club.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.610
( laughs )

34:21.660 --> 34:25.482
That would be
the Charley Bordelon
fan club.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.555
Sell him as the bad boy
instead of the family man.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.558
I can do that.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.818
And good for you,
Charley.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.428
Good for you.

34:33.470 --> 34:37.566
That nonprofit
is called SWOP, Frank.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.739
The Sex Worker's
Outreach Program.

34:39.770 --> 34:41.601
Make note
to the organization

34:41.640 --> 34:43.574
that the wire's being made
in the name of

34:43.610 --> 34:45.373
Milena Galoudian.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.668
Got it.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.879
A suit.

35:14.910 --> 35:17.333
Trying to impress,
like old times.

35:17.380 --> 35:20.372
- Shall we?
- Mm.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.655
( music playing )

36:13.770 --> 36:16.534
( giggles )

36:16.570 --> 36:18.458
( mumbles )

36:18.510 --> 36:20.808
Calvin, what's going on,
brother?

36:20.840 --> 36:22.728
Bruce, what are you
doing here?

36:22.780 --> 36:25.442
Oh, out with the Mrs.
for her birthday.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.300
Look at this beauty.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.614
Hello, pretty lady.

36:29.650 --> 36:31.413
Thank you.
Hello.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.940
What are you doing
with this guy?

36:32.990 --> 36:35.686
You like that
maga2ine cover type
I guess?

36:35.720 --> 36:37.585
Bruce Benson.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.621
Nova Bordelon.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.963
I know who this is.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.888
This is that bitch
from the "Daily News."

36:46.930 --> 36:48.898
The one set on
burning the entire
police department down.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.363
You can back it up, now.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.559
So, this is you?

36:52.610 --> 36:55.636
Let's go, Calvin.
He's drunk.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.602
I heard you left your wife
for some new piece,

36:57.640 --> 37:00.643
but you turn your back
on your brothers in uniform,
too?

37:00.680 --> 37:02.477
Ooh, that must be
some good ass.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.249
( gasps )

37:04.290 --> 37:06.611
Bouncer:
Hey, hey!

37:06.650 --> 37:10.711
Break it up, you two.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.250
Take it outside.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.599
You're a disgrace
to your brothers!

37:14.630 --> 37:16.450
- You should be ashamed
of yourself!
- Calvin: Yeah?

37:16.500 --> 37:17.592
Get your ass outside!

37:17.630 --> 37:19.769
I know you.
Come on, bitch!

37:19.800 --> 37:21.222
Out!

37:41.660 --> 37:43.013
Ralph Angel?

37:43.060 --> 37:44.618
Ralph Angel:
Yeah?

37:44.660 --> 37:46.753
Can you help me
with something, please?

37:46.790 --> 37:48.621
What's going on?

37:48.660 --> 37:50.355
I'm trying to use
the shelf,

37:50.400 --> 37:51.765
but something's
blocking it.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.062
Can you
get it for me?

37:53.100 --> 37:54.965
Come on.
Watch out.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.730
What is that?

38:12.550 --> 38:13.642
What is it?

38:13.690 --> 38:16.511
It's locked.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.687
I don't even know
where the key's at.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.720
Pop's handwriting.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.955
"To my dearest children.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.835
I, Ernest Bordelon,
of sound mind and body..."

39:01.870 --> 39:04.737
He wrote this
a couple months ago.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.847
"To my dear children,

39:11.880 --> 39:15.714
I, Ernest Bordelon,
of sound mind and body,

39:15.750 --> 39:18.617
am revising my last will
and testament.

39:21.020 --> 39:24.581
I hope no one needs this
for a long time.

39:24.630 --> 39:28.122
And I hope I can do this
in person one day.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.991
But if I can't,

39:30.030 --> 39:32.624
this paper will have
to stand in for me."

39:34.640 --> 39:36.699
( under his breath )
What is he saying?

39:38.910 --> 39:42.869
"I've made the decision
to pass this land,

39:42.910 --> 39:46.004
the land of my mother,
and her father before her,

39:46.050 --> 39:50.749
and his father before him,

39:50.780 --> 39:52.748
to the child of mine

39:52.790 --> 39:55.554
who needs it
and loves it most...

39:57.060 --> 39:58.982
Ralph Angel."

40:02.460 --> 40:04.667
Ernest's voice:
You, Ralph Angel,

40:04.700 --> 40:07.419
are more than you know.

40:07.470 --> 40:12.032
You and your sisters
are the moon and the sky
and the stars to me.

40:12.070 --> 40:14.573
Each of you.

40:14.610 --> 40:18.842
But this land is yours.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.815
Whatever has happened,
whatever you've done
in the past,

40:21.850 --> 40:25.616
never forget that you
are better than you think.

40:30.620 --> 40:33.851
You are smarter
than you think.

40:45.740 --> 40:49.699
You are stronger
than you think.

41:09.930 --> 41:14.026
Take this land,
build a home here.

41:14.070 --> 41:17.562
Build a family
for you and Blue here.

41:17.600 --> 41:22.139
Build our cane here,
stalk by stalk.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.570
Build a good life here,
Ralph Angel,

41:25.610 --> 41:27.009
so when you
get to the end,

41:27.050 --> 41:28.176
you can look back
and be proud

41:28.210 --> 41:29.871
of your days
on this Earth,

41:29.920 --> 41:30.978
on this land.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.011
It's all yours, son.

41:34.290 --> 41:37.885
Do right.
I know you can.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.650
Until we meet again,

41:40.690 --> 41:41.896
Pops.
