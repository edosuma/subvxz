Hello.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.285
- I love these.

00:19.318 --> 00:20.786
- Does anyone

00:19.318 --> 00:20.786
not hear me screaming?

00:20.820 --> 00:21.954
- No.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.954
- I could've come in,

00:21.987 --> 00:23.522
been a burglar,

00:21.987 --> 00:23.522
stole everything you had.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.910
- Well, we ain't got

00:23.556 --> 00:25.910
nothing to steal.

- Do you want to

00:26.992 --> 00:29.696
shell peas or shuck corn?

00:29.728 --> 00:31.498
- I hate shelling peas,

00:29.728 --> 00:31.498
it's hard work.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.767
- Yeah, well, Nanny told us

00:31.530 --> 00:33.767
that if we do all this,

00:33.799 --> 00:35.368
that it's gonna taste

00:33.799 --> 00:35.368
that much better.

- Come on,

00:36.503 --> 00:38.338
get your ass out here.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.640
- I don't have to do corn,

00:38.371 --> 00:40.640
I don't have to shell peas.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.908
- No, you didn't even

00:40.673 --> 00:42.908
do it when you was young.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.844
- You made me shell peas

00:42.942 --> 00:45.844
till my fingers bled.

00:45.878 --> 00:46.845
- Let me tell you something,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.149
you cannot expect a boomer

00:49.490 --> 00:50.417
to come in here

00:49.490 --> 00:50.417
and work like that.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.784
- I am not a boomer.

00:51.817 --> 00:53.520
- I don't know why

just has to, like,

00:53.552 --> 00:55.722
crap on the next one.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.790
- This generation has not

00:55.755 --> 00:57.790
done one good thing.

00:57.823 --> 00:58.924
- Huh.

00:58.957 --> 01:00.929
- We invented Starbucks.

You're welcome.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.161
- Yeah,

01:00.125 --> 01:02.161
and we invented selfies.

- You can't eat a selfie.

- Well, mine are

I really love this color.

all you have to do

is pick it up

- Yes. June 1st is the bronzer

- No. Just so y'all know,

June 1st is my birthday.

That's the middle of summer.

For as long as I can remember,

02:26.913 --> 02:28.814
- It's true, Savannah.

You want a pony?

- Boom.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.437
- No.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.437

05:34.968 --> 05:37.137
I gotta pee. That's a win.

05:41.173 --> 05:43.759
- He bought it. He bought it.

05:43.759 --> 05:45.779
- What are you talking about?

05:43.759 --> 05:45.779
- Thanks to your mother,

05:45.779 --> 05:49.816
Chase is gonna have

05:45.779 --> 05:49.816
this glorious, childish party

05:49.848 --> 05:51.817
that he claims he never had.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.721
- I have rented out

05:51.850 --> 05:54.721
this trampoline park.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.923
We're having popcorn,

05:54.754 --> 05:56.923
a face painter.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.557
- You know, like something

05:56.956 --> 05:58.557
you would do for Chloe?

05:58.591 --> 05:59.558
- Yeah.

05:58.591 --> 05:59.558
- I mean,

05:59.591 --> 06:00.793
it's gonna be amazing.

06:00.826 --> 06:03.463
Let's just say

06:00.826 --> 06:03.463
the mom guilt is real.

06:03.495 --> 06:05.398
- Well, I'm glad there's

06:03.495 --> 06:05.398
no such thing as dad guilt

06:05.432 --> 06:07.670
'cause I got enough

06:05.432 --> 06:07.670
to feel guilty about.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.536
- Hm, maybe we oughta

06:07.100 --> 06:09.536
create that.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.338
- So you've got

06:09.569 --> 06:11.338
this whole event planned?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.173
- Yeah.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.173
- Good, because

06:13.206 --> 06:14.908
I don't want this

06:13.206 --> 06:14.908
to be all about me

06:14.940 --> 06:17.944
which is why I changed

06:14.940 --> 06:17.944
the launch of my bronzer,

06:18.439 --> 06:19.745
and it's no longer

06:18.439 --> 06:19.745
launchin' on his birthday.

06:19.778 --> 06:22.819
- Aw, that's very sweet.

06:19.778 --> 06:22.819
Thanks, Savannah.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.552
And remember,

06:22.115 --> 06:25.552
I want to keep it a surprise.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.887
- It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.887
- It'll be great.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.560
- And your dad, he's gonna

06:27.920 --> 06:30.560
dress up like a clown.

06:30.899 --> 06:31.490
- No, Daddy's not dressing up.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.360
Nanny can be the clown.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.360
I'm not being the clown.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.795
Mama likes to dress up,

06:35.829 --> 06:38.197
so let her pop a nose on

06:35.829 --> 06:38.197
and run with it.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.971
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

06:46.505 --> 06:47.774
<i>- All right, come on.</i>

06:47.807 --> 06:49.750
- Oh, my God.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.750
- Oh.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.244
- Ah, stop. Slower.

06:51.276 --> 06:54.146
- Where's the car?

06:51.276 --> 06:54.146
- Right here.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.829
- I think I got

06:54.180 --> 06:57.829
the rest of the way.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.120
- Are you kidding me?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.120
- [laughs]

07:00.153 --> 07:02.187
- I cannot believe

07:00.153 --> 07:02.187
that I broke my foot

07:02.221 --> 07:04.290
while playing basketball.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.290
All I did was jump.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.259
- That's what happens

07:04.324 --> 07:06.259
when you're old.

07:06.589 --> 07:08.560
- Savannah, you are literally

07:06.589 --> 07:08.560
one year younger than me

07:08.595 --> 07:10.959
so you better watch out.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.350
- How come every one

07:11.831 --> 07:15.350
of our kids are such klutzes?

07:15.350 --> 07:17.336
- Yeah, from the one

07:15.350 --> 07:17.336
who broke his fibula

07:17.370 --> 07:19.139
walking across the patio.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.641
- I tripped over

07:19.172 --> 07:21.641
a temporary fence

07:21.675 --> 07:23.475
when they was putting

07:21.675 --> 07:23.475
the stuff around the pull.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.812
Mama, my leg hurts so bad.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.413
- And my heart hurts for you.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
- Does this hurt?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
Tell me if this hurts.

07:29.819 --> 07:31.617
- Don't touch me!

07:29.819 --> 07:31.617
- Ah!

07:31.651 --> 07:33.519
- So are you gonna cater to me

07:33.552 --> 07:35.654
the way you catered to Dad

07:33.552 --> 07:35.654
when he broke his foot?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.899
- Well, of course.

07:37.122 --> 07:40.259
- If anything, Dad, you could

07:37.122 --> 07:40.259
be a little kinder to me,

07:40.293 --> 07:41.860
considering that

07:40.293 --> 07:41.860
I broke my foot

07:41.894 --> 07:44.764
right around my birthday.

07:44.798 --> 07:49.435
- We have gone to great lengths

07:44.798 --> 07:49.435
to rent a trampoline park

07:49.468 --> 07:52.838
to give Chase the birthday

07:49.468 --> 07:52.838
that he's always wanted.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.875
Now how in the world's he gonna

07:52.872 --> 07:55.875
do anything with a broken foot?

07:55.908 --> 07:57.343
- As if we've not heard enough

07:57.377 --> 07:59.745
about all these birthday

07:57.377 --> 07:59.745
parties that he never had,

07:59.778 --> 08:01.480
now we gotta hear

07:59.778 --> 08:01.480
about this birthday party

08:01.514 --> 08:03.483
that he's not gonna have

08:01.514 --> 08:03.483
because of a broken foot.

08:03.516 --> 08:07.420
We will be hearing this [bleep]

08:03.516 --> 08:07.420
for the next 40 years.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.555
- I mean,

08:07.454 --> 08:09.555
the timing isn't great.

08:09.588 --> 08:11.257
- No, it sure is not.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.660
- My birthday is cursed.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.660
- I wouldn't say cursed.

08:13.692 --> 08:16.959
- No, you have

08:13.692 --> 08:16.959
a wonderful life, son.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.564
I don't know anyone else

08:17.596 --> 08:19.699
who could say

08:17.596 --> 08:19.699
they had a better life.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.339
- Savannah.

08:21.339 --> 08:22.802
- Well, other than her.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.937

08:31.310 --> 08:33.879
- Look at all that water.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.879
- It's beautiful.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.415
You know what, Chase?

08:33.913 --> 08:36.415
I appreciate you coming along,

08:36.448 --> 08:37.917
even with a broke foot.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.529
Now, it takes

08:37.951 --> 08:40.529
a gentleman to do that.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.354
- Oh, Nanny, it's nothing.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.222
I'm pretty much like Superman,

08:41.388 --> 08:43.222
you know?

08:43.255 --> 08:45.759
- I know.

08:43.255 --> 08:45.759
Now, Grayson, I've got this

08:45.792 --> 08:49.863
all set up for you so you can

08:45.792 --> 08:49.863
learn all about gems.

08:49.895 --> 08:51.331
- I already

08:49.895 --> 08:51.331
turned in my project

08:51.364 --> 08:53.659
so this is kind of pointless.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.400
But whatever.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.568
- Well, it'll be something

08:54.433 --> 08:56.568
you won't ever forget.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.238
I'll promise you that.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.905
Come on,

08:58.270 --> 08:59.905
let's get our tour started.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.642
- That's right.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.642
Grayson, get off your phone.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.177
- Chase, I'm trying

09:02.676 --> 09:04.177
to get service.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.413
- Well, enjoy this.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.114
I thought that

09:06.446 --> 09:08.114
you'd be way more into this

09:08.148 --> 09:09.515
'cause I thought

09:08.148 --> 09:09.515
science was your thing.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.750
- Yeah, but it's the weekend

09:10.783 --> 09:12.384
and all my friends

09:10.783 --> 09:12.384
are hanging out.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.354
- Come on, let's us

09:12.418 --> 09:14.354
put our helmets on

09:14.386 --> 09:17.230
and we in for the ride.

09:14.386 --> 09:17.230
Come on, Gray.

09:17.230 --> 09:18.258
- And of course, Nanny takes me

09:18.291 --> 09:19.926
to the one place

09:18.291 --> 09:19.926
with no service.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.929
- Oh, my God, Grayson.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.929
You'll be fine.

09:24.299 --> 09:25.197
How do I look, Nanny?

09:25.230 --> 09:26.732
- You look great.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.732
- Duck your heads, everybody.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.168
- Oh, duck.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.168
- Duck down.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.769
- Ooh!

09:30.736 --> 09:32.438
- I'm freaking out right now.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.441
- It's gonna be just fine,

09:32.471 --> 09:34.441
all right?

09:34.474 --> 09:36.475
- Now this is

09:34.474 --> 09:36.475
right in my element.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.477
- Yeah, I mean, this is,

09:36.509 --> 09:38.477
like, pretty cool.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.879
- Now, there might be some

09:38.510 --> 09:40.879
river rats in here.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.820
- What is that?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.417
- It's rats that

09:42.115 --> 09:44.417
hang around a river, dummy.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.751
- [chuckles]

09:45.784 --> 09:48.388
- This brown stuff, this is

09:45.784 --> 09:48.388
what we call travertine.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.624
Commonly seen for kitchen

09:48.421 --> 09:51.624
counters and things like that.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.360
- Wonder what kind of rocks

09:51.658 --> 09:54.360
we could find in here.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.495
What kind do you think

09:54.394 --> 09:56.495
we might could find?

09:56.528 --> 09:57.797
- I don't know.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.899
- All right, so do y'all

09:57.831 --> 09:59.899
have any questions for me?

10:00.659 --> 10:01.634
- Is there any reception

10:00.659 --> 10:01.634
in here?

10:01.668 --> 10:04.203
- Unfortunately, you're in

10:01.668 --> 10:04.203
the wrong cave for that.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.239
- Then this is pointless

10:04.236 --> 10:06.239
'cause I have no service.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.506
- Grayson, just enjoy it.

10:07.539 --> 10:08.975
- You didn't tell me

10:07.539 --> 10:08.975
there wasn't gonna be

10:09.899 --> 10:10.442
any cell reception.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.479
- Well, that's the greatest

10:10.476 --> 10:12.479
thing that ever come along.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.480
- Yeah, spend your time

10:12.511 --> 10:14.480
with your grandma.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.782
- Mm-hmm.

10:23.230 --> 10:25.491
- Oh, this is where

10:23.230 --> 10:25.491
you find your catch.

10:25.524 --> 10:26.493
- Right here?

10:26.525 --> 10:28.427
- You gotta put that dirt

10:28.461 --> 10:30.263
- Okay, and then we just--

10:28.461 --> 10:30.263
- And you sift it.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.980
- All right.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.980
Gray, you wanna do it first?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.433
- No, I'm good.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.433
- This is how you do it.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.568
Gray-Gray,

10:34.466 --> 10:36.568
get off of your phone

10:36.602 --> 10:39.139
and look at all this stuff.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.139
This is cool.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.572
- Isn't this stuff

10:39.172 --> 10:40.572
for little kids?

10:40.606 --> 10:42.341
What can we actually find?

10:40.606 --> 10:42.341
- Little kids?

10:43.942 --> 10:45.879
- I love you, Nanny,

10:43.942 --> 10:45.879
but this is lame.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.212
- Come on, what are you doing?

10:47.246 --> 10:50.830
- Trying to get service.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.830
- You don't need service.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.684
- Nanny, I'm going to find

10:50.115 --> 10:51.684
more cell coverage.

- No, you're not, come here.

You're missing out.

10:55.879 --> 10:58.124
I thought he would love this.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.929
- I know, Nanny, but I mean,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.929
you just gotta understand

11:00.125 --> 11:02.861
he's just going through those

11:00.125 --> 11:02.861
teenage year things, you know?

11:02.895 --> 11:04.431
You remember,

11:02.895 --> 11:04.431
whenever I was younger,

11:04.464 --> 11:06.432
you would always want me

11:04.464 --> 11:06.432

11:18.912 --> 11:20.480
Don't worry about that.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.480
What we need to worry about

11:20.513 --> 11:23.115
is finding some gold so we can

11:20.513 --> 11:23.115
have some lunch money.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.350
Are we splitting it?

11:24.384 --> 11:27.486
- No, 60-40.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.595
This chicken's

11:33.759 --> 11:35.595

11:35.628 --> 11:36.796
- Mm-hmm.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.990
- Mama, you have molested

11:36.830 --> 11:39.990
that chicken wing.

11:39.990 --> 11:40.600
- Todd, I'm a bone sucker.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.102
I love to suck on bone.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.102
It's so good.

- You're the one

11:44.770 --> 11:46.840
that invited us to dinner

11:46.873 --> 11:49.341
and I wanted

11:46.873 --> 11:49.341
to eat mine in peace.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.379
- Okay, well, the reason

11:49.375 --> 11:52.379
we actually brought y'all here

11:52.412 --> 11:54.279
is because we need

11:52.412 --> 11:54.279
to get some ideas

11:54.313 --> 11:55.648
for Chase's birthday party.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.649
I mean, I was gonna do it

11:55.682 --> 11:57.649
at the trampoline park

11:57.683 --> 11:59.818
but now that he has

11:57.683 --> 11:59.818
a broken foot,

11:59.852 --> 12:02.254
that kinda seems like

11:59.852 --> 12:02.254
a slap in the face.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.490
- Right, so just tell us

12:03.523 --> 12:05.725
kinda what you think

12:03.523 --> 12:05.725
that he would want.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.260
- Listen, I got a list

12:05.759 --> 12:08.260
in my head of what he wants.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.629
- Okay, so give us some ideas.

12:10.629 --> 12:11.764
- Well, I know he wants

12:10.629 --> 12:11.764
oceanfront property.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.332
- And he wants a sports car.

12:13.365 --> 12:15.679
- Bugatti runs

12:13.365 --> 12:15.679
about $3 million.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.602
- Okay.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.602
- And we could get matching

12:16.635 --> 12:18.705
ones 'cause it'd look good

12:16.635 --> 12:18.705
if we both pulled up together.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.472
- Okay, no to both of those.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.774
- He wants a motorcycle.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.759
- Not happening.

12:23.759 --> 12:24.576
- No, I don't want him

12:23.759 --> 12:24.576
having that.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.846
- Okay, he wants

12:24.610 --> 12:26.846
a brand-new Rolex.

12:26.879 --> 12:27.947
- No.

12:26.879 --> 12:27.947
- Keep going.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.883
- Oh, my gosh.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.883
I know he wants a yacht.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.850
- Hey, most of all,

12:29.916 --> 12:32.850
he wants some hookers.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.287
- Oh, my God.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.287
[laughter]

12:34.320 --> 12:35.688
- Mama, my Go--

12:35.721 --> 12:37.691
- Desperate times

12:35.721 --> 12:37.691
call for desperate measures

12:37.724 --> 12:40.659
and if I have to sit through

12:37.724 --> 12:40.659
a thousand bad ideas

12:40.693 --> 12:42.162
just to come up

12:40.693 --> 12:42.162
with one good one,

12:42.195 --> 12:43.863
well then,

12:42.195 --> 12:43.863
that's what I'm gonna do.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.831
- I love your dedication

12:43.897 --> 12:45.831
to this.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.801
But let's face it,

12:45.865 --> 12:47.801
Chase should feel lucky

12:47.834 --> 12:49.269
over anything that he gets.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.738
I mean, I had babies at 25

12:49.302 --> 12:51.738
for my birthday,

12:51.770 --> 12:54.841
so the only thing I got

12:51.770 --> 12:54.841
was a [bleep] diaper.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.509
These are not realistic things.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.509
- Not at all.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.611
- I mean, that's pretty much

12:57.543 --> 12:59.611
all he wants

12:59.645 --> 13:01.470
besides Todd

12:59.645 --> 13:01.470
buying him a house.

13:01.809 --> 13:03.883
- Come on, Elliott.

13:01.809 --> 13:03.883
There must be something else.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.519
- I mean, he did say

13:03.917 --> 13:06.519
that he wanted a pony.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.486
What do you want?

13:07.519 --> 13:08.520
You want a pony?

13:08.554 --> 13:11.570
- That might be nice, for once.

13:11.909 --> 13:12.926
- Maybe we could do,

13:11.909 --> 13:12.926
like, a pony ride

13:12.958 --> 13:14.394
or petting zoo, or something.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.129
I mean, that's still

13:14.427 --> 13:17.129
kinda juvenile-ish

13:17.163 --> 13:19.466
so we might

13:17.163 --> 13:19.466
could make that work.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.634
- A pony's might be

13:19.499 --> 13:22.634
too little for him.

13:22.668 --> 13:25.270
- Then you can buy him

13:22.668 --> 13:25.270
the watch that's $35,000.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.740
- Oh, I'll tell him the time

13:26.773 --> 13:28.408
and I'll help you

13:26.773 --> 13:28.408
find that pony.

13:38.217 --> 13:41.287

13:38.217 --> 13:41.287

13:43.188 --> 13:45.424
You've come a long way.

You're not quite

13:45.457 --> 13:47.494

13:47.527 --> 13:50.163
- Yeah, okay.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.163
Why are you even here?

13:50.196 --> 13:52.698
- Well, Grayson, I wanted to

13:50.196 --> 13:52.698
talk to you about something.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.100
- What do you want

13:52.731 --> 13:54.100
to talk about?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.302
- Your attitude when we were

13:54.100 --> 13:56.302
with Nanny, Gray.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.304
- This is not as fun

13:56.336 --> 13:59.304
as storm chasing.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.409
- I mean, you can't

13:59.338 --> 14:01.409
act like that.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.808
- What was the deal, Gray?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.744
- Well, all my friends

14:02.841 --> 14:04.744
were hanging out

14:04.778 --> 14:06.245
and having a party and I just

14:06.278 --> 14:08.480
wanted to know

14:06.278 --> 14:08.480
what was going on.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.448
- I mean, Grayson, I get it.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.216
You wanna be out there

14:09.481 --> 14:11.216
living your best life

14:11.250 --> 14:12.818
and doing your thing

14:12.851 --> 14:15.889
but what is important

14:12.851 --> 14:15.889
right now, Grayson, is Nanny.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.557
Like, you got to appreciate

14:15.922 --> 14:18.557
the time that you have with her

14:18.591 --> 14:21.940
because there's always

14:18.591 --> 14:21.940
gonna be another party

14:21.126 --> 14:23.196
but you're not gonna always

14:21.126 --> 14:23.196
have time with Nanny.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.698
- In all fairness,

14:23.229 --> 14:25.698
it was just a school project

14:25.731 --> 14:27.667
and Nanny made it

14:25.731 --> 14:27.667
into this big thing.

14:27.701 --> 14:33.105
- Yeah, but only because

14:27.701 --> 14:33.105
she wants to connect with you.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.407
- Yeah, I know.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.908
- You know, Gray,

14:34.441 --> 14:35.908
I just want you

14:35.942 --> 14:37.476
to enjoy time with Nanny

14:37.509 --> 14:42.381
because I miss my grandmother

14:37.509 --> 14:42.381
every single day.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.250
And if I could go back,

14:42.414 --> 14:45.250
I would have spent more time.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.619
- I didn't think about it

14:45.284 --> 14:46.619
like that.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.687
- And listen, I guarantee you,

14:46.653 --> 14:48.687
your friends,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.423
they'd be having FOMO

14:48.721 --> 14:50.423
if they knew

14:50.456 --> 14:54.940
that you were in a cave

14:50.456 --> 14:54.940
mining for gems.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.960
- I definitely,

14:54.940 --> 14:56.960
definitely, definitely

14:56.960 --> 14:58.331
do not think that's the case.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.331
- I don't think so either.

but yet I'm the one

15:22.621 --> 15:24.323
who had to go.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.879
- Nope.

- Then you had this llama

who I truly believe

15:49.820 --> 15:50.283
wanted to make out with me.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.351
that animal loves you.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.921
like I did in 1986

15:54.953 --> 15:56.355
does not mean

15:54.953 --> 15:56.355

16:50.210 --> 16:52.778
- Gray-Gray, are you gonna

16:50.210 --> 16:52.778
tell me what's in that box?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.780
- No, Nanny, it's a surprise.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.883
Let's go in here, Nanny,

16:54.813 --> 16:56.883
and I'll show you what it is.

16:56.915 --> 17:00.860
- If you put a snake or rat

16:56.915 --> 17:00.860
in there, I'll kill you.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.553
- It's neither one of those.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.223
- What is this place,

17:01.587 --> 17:04.223
Gray-Gray?

17:04.257 --> 17:08.595
- It's a butterfly sanctuary.

17:04.257 --> 17:08.595
- Oh, look how beautiful.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.663
I love a butterfly.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.798
- I know and that's why

17:10.696 --> 17:12.798
I brought you here.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.733
And now we're gonna let

17:12.832 --> 17:14.733
these butterflies loose.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.359
- Well, I love it.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.672
- See, they're frozen,

17:16.359 --> 17:18.672
so they're, like, asleep.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.400
And when you put them

17:18.704 --> 17:20.400
in your hand,

17:20.730 --> 17:21.941
the heat wakes them up

17:20.730 --> 17:21.941
and they start flying away.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.476
- Oh!

17:23.509 --> 17:26.211
- Now, Nanny, I did all this

17:23.509 --> 17:26.211
because you're important to me

17:26.246 --> 17:28.448
and I'm sorry

17:26.246 --> 17:28.448
for how I acted the other day.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.884
My friends were texting me

17:28.480 --> 17:30.884
about their party

17:30.916 --> 17:33.720
and I'm sorry, I should've

17:30.916 --> 17:33.720
been focused on our adventure.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.689
- Now listen, I'm not gonna

17:33.752 --> 17:35.689
get too mad at you

17:35.721 --> 17:37.390
about a darn party.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.599
'Cause you know

17:37.423 --> 17:40.599
I love a good party.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.561
But don't outgrow me.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.561
- I'm not gonna outgrow you.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.230
- 'Cause this makes me happy

17:44.263 --> 17:46.766
to know that you would

17:44.263 --> 17:46.766
do something like this.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.734
- I'm glad I got to

17:46.799 --> 17:48.734
make this right with Nanny.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.836
- Look at you,

17:48.768 --> 17:50.836
acting all mature.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.939
I mean, I'm proud of you

17:50.869 --> 17:52.939
but don't get carried away

17:52.971 --> 17:54.340
and try to steal

17:52.971 --> 17:54.340
my ride or die.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.742
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.244
- That's amazing.

17:59.278 --> 18:02.848
Look at--it's coming awake.

17:59.278 --> 18:02.848
Look at it.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.818
That--oh, look at that.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.818
Flew away.

18:05.852 --> 18:10.559
Grayson, you made this day

18:05.852 --> 18:10.559
so special for me

18:10.900 --> 18:12.358
and I love you, buddy.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.358
- I love you.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.393
Do you want to

18:12.392 --> 18:13.393
release some more?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.528
- Yeah.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.565
Come on, sucker, fly.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.566
Fly.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.567
You about as stubborn as Todd.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.208
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

18:28.875 --> 18:30.143
<i>- You ready, Coco?</i>

18:28.875 --> 18:30.143
<i>- Yes.</i>

18:30.175 --> 18:31.744
- So what do you

18:30.175 --> 18:31.744
wanna do first?

18:31.778 --> 18:32.746
- Jump on a trampoline.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.470
- You wanna jump?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.470
- Yes.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.648
The trampolines are over there.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.648
- All right.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.451
all: Surprise!

18:39.486 --> 18:42.255
[cheers and applause]

18:42.288 --> 18:44.656
- This is the birthday party

18:42.288 --> 18:44.656
that you never had.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.227
- You know, remember the ones

18:44.691 --> 18:47.227
you always said you wanted--

18:47.259 --> 18:48.627
- Yeah.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.627
- And you never got?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.829
- I did not.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.829
- So I wanted to include

18:50.864 --> 18:55.501
every childhood favorite

18:50.864 --> 18:55.501
from a candy bar to a clown.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.269
And what better place than here

18:57.302 --> 18:59.720
for kids to jump around

18:57.302 --> 18:59.720
and play around?

18:59.720 --> 19:01.207
- You decided to do this to me

18:59.720 --> 19:01.207
when I have a broken foot

19:01.240 --> 19:03.777
so I can't even play.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.777
- Listen, son, this was set up

19:03.809 --> 19:05.345
way before you broke your foot.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.799
And we didn't have time

19:05.377 --> 19:07.799
to change it.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.182
- Leave it up to me

19:07.113 --> 19:09.182
to sabotage my own birthday.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.884
- Right?

19:09.214 --> 19:10.884
- I know.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.185
- Where's Grayson at?

19:10.916 --> 19:13.185
- He had ball today.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.721
- Yeah, he had a baseball game.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.189
- And listen,

19:14.753 --> 19:16.189
he's my retirement--

19:16.221 --> 19:17.289
- And mine.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.692
- I cannot take him

19:17.323 --> 19:18.692
off the field.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.326
- Well, I'm honestly surprised

19:18.724 --> 19:20.326
to even see you here.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.694
What about your launch?

19:21.728 --> 19:24.564
- Well, I pushed it

19:21.728 --> 19:24.564
because it was your birthday.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.900
I was gonna allow this day

19:24.596 --> 19:26.900
to be about you.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.268
- Well, that was

19:26.932 --> 19:28.268
very nice of you, Savannah.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.436
- It's your 25th birthday, son,

19:30.470 --> 19:33.405
and we want you to know

19:30.470 --> 19:33.405
how special you are to us.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.709
- So your dad and I

19:33.440 --> 19:35.709
got you a special gift

19:35.741 --> 19:37.277
and we hope that you love it.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.511
- And it's something

19:37.309 --> 19:39.511
you've always wanted.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.413
- You know, he's always

19:39.546 --> 19:41.413
talking about a monkey.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.500
- Oh, yeah, he's in love

19:41.448 --> 19:44.500
with those capuchin monkeys.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.519
- What is cuter

19:44.500 --> 19:46.519
than a capuchin monkey?

19:46.859 --> 19:47.529
A monkey.

19:47.869 --> 19:48.288
Who does not want a monkey?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.356
Would you ever

19:48.320 --> 19:50.356
have a pet monkey?

19:50.390 --> 19:53.192
No? I would.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.161
Shut the [bleep] up.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.630
No way! [laughs]

19:57.663 --> 19:59.865
- Happy birthday, boy.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.865
- No way!

19:59.898 --> 20:01.300
I mean, do I get

19:59.898 --> 20:01.300
to keep this forever?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.359
- No, we just get her

20:01.334 --> 20:03.359
for the day.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.137
- Here, come here.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.137
- Finally, I got a monkey!

20:05.171 --> 20:06.239
Come here.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.840
Oh.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.840
- There you go.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.108
- Yay!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.108
[monkey chirps]

20:09.142 --> 20:11.944
It's so good to see Chase

20:09.142 --> 20:11.944
happy on his birthday.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.779
And who would've thought

20:11.978 --> 20:13.779
that it would've been

20:13.813 --> 20:16.982
Elliott and Nanny who

20:13.813 --> 20:16.982
saved the day with their list?

20:17.170 --> 20:18.585
- Here you go, baby.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.953
- Yeah, there you go.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.953
- [laughs]

20:20.987 --> 20:23.288
- But what's really important

20:20.987 --> 20:23.288
is that we did it.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.424
I mean, there's no more

20:23.323 --> 20:25.424
mom guilt for me

20:25.458 --> 20:27.192
and there's no more

20:25.458 --> 20:27.192
Chase complaining about

20:27.227 --> 20:29.194
not having a birthday party.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.230
- Now we'll just have to

20:29.229 --> 20:31.230
hear about the broken foot

20:31.263 --> 20:32.598
for the next 25 years.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.401
- You're probably right.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.202
- Between actually having

20:34.433 --> 20:37.202
a party and getting a monkey,

20:37.237 --> 20:38.337
I don't know that

20:37.237 --> 20:38.337
this could be any better.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.599
- [laughs]

20:38.371 --> 20:40.599
- I really don't.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.375
Y'all went over the top.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.375
- Mom, can we jump?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.911
- Yeah, you can go.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.911
Go over there and jump.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.147
- [laughing]

20:45.811 --> 20:48.147
- She'll do anything.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.148
Daredevil.

20:49.182 --> 20:51.917
- [laughing]

20:51.951 --> 20:54.586
- Ha, ha, there we go, Nanny.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.586
- Ain't that precious?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.923
Oh, look at that.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.490
- It finally feels

20:56.955 --> 20:58.490
like it's my birthday.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.599
- Oh, I know.

21:00.599 --> 21:03.229
- After years of complaining

21:00.599 --> 21:03.229
about my childhood birthdays,

21:03.262 --> 21:05.298
I finally get one.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.467
I mean, the location

21:05.330 --> 21:07.467
was kind of a slap in the face

21:07.500 --> 21:08.701
because my foot is broken,

21:08.734 --> 21:10.936
but seeing my dad

21:08.734 --> 21:10.936
almost have a heart attack

21:10.970 --> 21:12.105
made it all better.

21:12.137 --> 21:15.808
- [screaming]

21:15.842 --> 21:16.942
<i>- But let me</i>

21:15.842 --> 21:16.942
<i>tell you something,</i>

21:16.976 --> 21:19.578
the icing on the cake

21:16.976 --> 21:19.578
was my monkey.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
And I could tell

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
that she loved me

21:21.980 --> 21:23.215
and I love her.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.117
Oh, God,

21:23.249 --> 21:25.117
I gotta get one of these.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.152
This is amazing.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.387
[monkey squeals]

21:26.185 --> 21:28.387
- [screams]

21:28.421 --> 21:30.690
- If that's her reaction

21:28.421 --> 21:30.690
to Savannah,

21:30.723 --> 21:31.691
I'll take two.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.759
