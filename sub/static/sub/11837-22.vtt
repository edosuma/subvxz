WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.235
WILSON: Previously
on "The Practice"

00:02.268 --> 00:04.003
We've decided to let you go.
Go where?

00:04.037 --> 00:07.073
Here's a check representing
two weeks' severance pay.

00:07.107 --> 00:10.076
I've generated fees
in excess of $6 million.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.312
You've handed me
a check for $15,000.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.080
BERLUTI: I've always wanted
to hang my own shingle.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.415
I got street creds.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.017
You got integrity.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.085
Maybe we should form
kind of a partnership.

00:19.119 --> 00:22.255
Me and you as partners.

00:22.288 --> 00:24.157
I'd love to submit your name
to the governor's counsel.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.459
To be a superior-court judge?
Any word?

00:26.492 --> 00:28.695
YOUNG: The council
confirmed me.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.429
I got it.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.263
Eugene, that's--

00:30.296 --> 00:32.098
(laughing)

00:33.199 --> 00:34.067
Oh, my god.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.168
Oh, my god.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.871
Do you think
we pay you $160,000

00:37.904 --> 00:39.305
to come down here
to the storage room

00:39.339 --> 00:41.041
and smoke pot, Sally?

00:41.074 --> 00:43.243
SHORE: I thought
you were absolutely

00:43.276 --> 00:45.211
sensational up on that bar.

00:50.416 --> 00:51.752
Well, that was surprising.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.353
I think you like me.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.855
Shh.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.256
WILSON: You like her

00:56.289 --> 00:58.058
and you don't like yourself,

00:58.091 --> 01:00.534
with her,
you get to remake yourself...

01:02.503 --> 01:03.570
at least somewhat.

01:04.638 --> 01:05.972
You got a window, Al.

01:06.006 --> 01:08.742
Just because girls in your
age bracket wait around,

01:08.775 --> 01:10.811
don't be thinking I will.

01:13.146 --> 01:14.447
WILSON: I know
that you're afraid

01:14.480 --> 01:16.116
to let yourself feel
for people.

01:16.149 --> 01:17.050
That's quite an indictment
of a person.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.151
WILSON: Prove me wrong
with evidence--

01:18.184 --> 01:20.554
The last time you felt for
a woman in any relationship.

01:20.587 --> 01:21.855
I feel for you!

01:23.624 --> 01:26.259
I am so ashamed,
I'm gonna buy a car.

01:26.292 --> 01:27.293
Would you like to come
with me?

01:27.327 --> 01:28.962
Because I'd like
watching you

01:28.995 --> 01:32.465
watch me buy a $100,000 car.

01:35.836 --> 01:37.437
Oh, gee.

01:37.470 --> 01:39.005
Now I need to shop.

01:42.709 --> 01:45.546
You certainly don't expect me
to try a case like this.

01:45.579 --> 01:48.048
Judge Noonan goes to Nantucket
next week for the summer.

01:48.081 --> 01:48.882
My neck hurts.

01:48.915 --> 01:51.051
Go away.

01:51.084 --> 01:53.486
Denny, problem,
Hannah's neck hurts,

01:53.520 --> 01:55.121
and she's refusing her
trial assignment.

01:55.155 --> 01:56.523
Tell her to go--

01:56.557 --> 01:57.558
SHEPLEY: Denny

01:59.492 --> 02:01.301
Walter...

02:01.334 --> 02:03.604
Have you got a second?
It's, uh, rather urgent.

02:03.637 --> 02:06.640
Well, go into my office.

02:06.673 --> 02:08.174
Tell Hannah where to go.

02:09.876 --> 02:11.712
You know that my company
has been very progressive

02:11.745 --> 02:13.714
when it comes to hiring people
with disabilities.

02:13.747 --> 02:16.617
I've received many,
many awards.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.652
I don't even like
the word "disability."

02:18.685 --> 02:21.121
I prefer "special ability,"
you know,

02:21.154 --> 02:22.889
like "Special Olympics."

02:22.923 --> 02:24.725
I'm getting off track.

02:24.758 --> 02:25.792
What I'm saying,

02:25.826 --> 02:28.028
I have many
wheelchair-bound employees

02:28.061 --> 02:31.798
who I also consider
to be extremely special people.

02:31.832 --> 02:33.033
Oh, Walter...

02:34.535 --> 02:36.870
don't tell me
you make them race.

02:36.903 --> 02:38.705
No, damn it, no.

02:38.739 --> 02:40.140
Well, all this talk
about Olympics is very--

02:40.173 --> 02:42.743
SHEPLEY: Will you please be
quiet and let me finish?!

02:47.180 --> 02:50.216
As you know,
I think people in wheelchairs

02:50.250 --> 02:52.686
are not only intelligent.

02:52.719 --> 02:54.655
I'm a beacon
when it comes to believing

02:54.688 --> 02:56.089
that they're also attractive,

02:58.024 --> 02:59.893
physically attractive,

03:01.668 --> 03:03.169
sexually attractive.

03:06.072 --> 03:07.674
I like to touch them.

03:09.743 --> 03:12.045
Denny, I've been arrested
for kissing some

03:12.078 --> 03:14.347
of my wheelchair women

03:14.380 --> 03:15.649
and two others on crutches.

03:15.682 --> 03:16.617
I...

03:17.483 --> 03:19.520
I was assured
it would go away,

03:19.553 --> 03:20.921
but it hasn't.

03:22.255 --> 03:24.190
The trial is set to go today.

03:25.491 --> 03:27.193
I want you to take over.

03:28.695 --> 03:30.396
You come to me
the day of trial?

03:30.430 --> 03:32.498
I thought it would go away,

03:32.533 --> 03:35.969
and I was so embarrassed
to tell you.

03:36.002 --> 03:37.303
I need your help.

03:37.904 --> 03:41.575
Denny, I have a reputation.

03:41.608 --> 03:44.144
Well, if you didn't,
you certainly have one now.

03:45.712 --> 03:46.813
Please.

03:54.988 --> 03:56.189
You kiss them?

03:57.257 --> 03:58.859
I can't help it.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.503
Walter, I can't
represent a pervert.

04:02.536 --> 04:05.305
Denny Crane does not have
sicko friends.

04:05.338 --> 04:07.574
You're practically
my best friend.

04:07.608 --> 04:09.810
Denny...

04:09.843 --> 04:11.311
You're an evildoer.

04:13.714 --> 04:17.718
(music playing)

04:53.186 --> 04:54.988
This is the problem
with having feelings.

04:55.021 --> 04:56.757
People expect
you to talk about them.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.759
I know. It's awful.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.467
CRANE: Alan,
I'm told you like sicko,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.203
perverse sexual deviants.

05:03.236 --> 05:07.207
Denny, it's not that I like
them so much as I am one.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.543
A very dear friend of mine

05:09.576 --> 05:11.377
is sexually attracted
to invalids.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.780
He needs our help, son.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.316
And you can't help him
because...

05:16.349 --> 05:17.751
He disgusts me.

05:17.784 --> 05:18.752
Ah.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.220
CRANE: He's been arrested
for assault,

05:20.253 --> 05:22.923
and his trial, unfortunately,

05:22.956 --> 05:23.990
starts today, so--

05:24.024 --> 05:25.626
Today?
CRANE: Yes.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.694
I'll open, first chair.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.129
I need you to back me up.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.042
Alan hello.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.211
Tara, what a nice surprise.

05:45.912 --> 05:46.680
Mm.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.884
Sally what's
with the outfit?

05:50.917 --> 05:53.153
Thought I'd go grown-up,
see if I like it.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.320
I don't.

06:02.302 --> 06:06.306
Listen I feel funny
asking you this but...

06:07.641 --> 06:10.043
the ibuprofen isn't getting
the job done for me.

06:10.076 --> 06:12.112
Would you...

06:12.145 --> 06:15.582
have any pot I could...

06:15.616 --> 06:17.117
Ha ha.

06:17.150 --> 06:18.885
ROSE: I'm being serious.

06:18.919 --> 06:21.054
You certainly know
I'm incapable of humor.

06:21.087 --> 06:23.156
You want to smoke pot?

06:23.189 --> 06:25.091
I am in pain.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.328
For God's sakes,

06:28.361 --> 06:30.396
think of the leverage
you'd have on me.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.636
PESCATORE: My friend,
Gilley Cacheri,

06:35.669 --> 06:37.504
he's a doctor,
a psychiatrist,

06:37.538 --> 06:39.105
I had him examine her.

06:39.139 --> 06:40.073
Who?

06:40.106 --> 06:41.474
Fat Angelina, he says

06:41.508 --> 06:42.776
she has post-traumatic

06:42.809 --> 06:44.344
botched wedding disorder.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.179
Point is, he'll say
whatever we want him to,

06:46.212 --> 06:48.248
and for the truth,
he'll give a discount.

06:48.281 --> 06:49.650
STRINGER: Jimmy.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.484
Jamie, hey.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.253
So, this is it, huh?

06:53.286 --> 06:54.521
Yeah.

06:54.555 --> 06:56.923
Jamie stringer, Suzy Paponi.

06:56.957 --> 06:57.891
It's a pleasure.

06:57.924 --> 06:58.825
Uh-huh.

06:58.859 --> 07:01.334
BERLUTI: So, what brings you?

07:01.367 --> 07:03.336
Well, as you know,
I've been putting

07:03.369 --> 07:05.105
my résumé out there.

07:05.138 --> 07:07.440
And believe it or not,

07:07.473 --> 07:10.677
the way you described
this place,

07:10.711 --> 07:13.479
I don't know what
your situation is but, um--

07:13.514 --> 07:15.148
Jamie, I couldn't pay you.

07:15.181 --> 07:16.182
STRINGER: I know that.

07:16.216 --> 07:17.784
It makes it more exciting.

07:17.818 --> 07:19.620
I feel like a pioneer,
I guess.

07:19.653 --> 07:21.154
Can I talk to you a second?

07:22.789 --> 07:24.157
She can never work here.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.191
Why not?

07:25.225 --> 07:28.294
Look at her,
she is not a real person.

07:28.328 --> 07:31.264
Suzy, if we got a graduate
from Harvard law school

07:31.297 --> 07:33.233
for free, can you imagine?

07:33.266 --> 07:35.068
And she's
an excellent lawyer.

07:35.101 --> 07:37.337
We got a meeting with
the bridal-shop owner at 3:00.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.506
I think I can make
this go away.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.708
BERLUTI: Lenny,
this is Jamie stringer.

07:41.742 --> 07:43.577
She works at my old firm.

07:43.610 --> 07:45.045
She's interested
in coming here.

07:45.078 --> 07:47.147
Why?

07:47.180 --> 07:49.315
Well, she likes
the kind of work we do.

07:49.349 --> 07:51.718
You banging her?
Lenny...

07:51.752 --> 07:53.720
QUINN: How come you hire her,
but you won't hire me?

07:53.754 --> 07:54.988
She's a lawyer. You're--

07:55.021 --> 07:56.089
QUINN: I got legal
schooling, Jimmy.

07:56.122 --> 07:57.558
That doesn't mean--
I could be an asset.

07:57.591 --> 07:59.025
He banging you?
Hey.

07:59.059 --> 08:01.702
I don't bang.
We don't talk like that here,

08:01.735 --> 08:02.669
you understand?

08:02.703 --> 08:04.470
You got too many rules.

08:13.346 --> 08:16.182
I'm just concerned
this will damage my legacy.

08:16.216 --> 08:19.285
Not to worry,
many CEOs love to fondle

08:19.319 --> 08:21.087
their wheelchair employees.

08:23.189 --> 08:23.924
Denny...

08:23.957 --> 08:25.626
Suck it up, Walter.

08:27.694 --> 08:29.195
WOMAN: All rise.

08:30.764 --> 08:32.432
This court is in session.

08:32.465 --> 08:35.034
The Honorable
Eugene Young presiding.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.369
Eugene!

08:38.138 --> 08:39.371
My buddy!

08:40.640 --> 08:41.908
Chambers.

08:49.516 --> 08:50.884
How did you get me
assigned to this?

08:50.917 --> 08:51.785
I want to know.

08:51.818 --> 08:53.486
I didn't, I swear.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.721
So, it's just a coincidence,

08:54.755 --> 08:57.323
my first case, my very first
case, I get you?

08:57.357 --> 09:00.734
5,000 lawyers in this town,
and I get you?

09:00.767 --> 09:03.336
You say coincidence,
I say "Act of God."

09:03.369 --> 09:05.839
Come on, give me a hug,
you big bear, you.

09:05.872 --> 09:06.740
Everybody out but him.

09:06.773 --> 09:08.909
Ex parte, a terrific start.

09:08.942 --> 09:10.443
I will jail you for contempt,

09:10.476 --> 09:12.579
that will be my very first
official act.

09:12.613 --> 09:14.280
He's making for a fabulous
judge so far,

09:14.314 --> 09:15.549
don't you think?
I'm sorry.

09:15.582 --> 09:17.751
Is there some
relationship here?

09:17.784 --> 09:19.319
This man used to work
for me.

09:19.352 --> 09:20.220
I fired him.

09:20.253 --> 09:21.688
SHORE: I'll happily waive
the conflict

09:21.722 --> 09:22.856
if that's where you're headed.

09:24.257 --> 09:25.659
Ms. Alexander, I apologize,

09:25.692 --> 09:27.193
but I must recuse myself.

09:27.227 --> 09:29.896
I am totally fine
with you presiding.

09:29.930 --> 09:32.432
He has a little trouble
being fair when I'm around.

09:34.234 --> 09:35.335
Denny Crane.

09:37.237 --> 09:38.438
Come on.

09:40.541 --> 09:42.943
You will get another judge,
that's all.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.951
That's all.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.676
It's not just that he sexually
assaulted these women.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.579
It's that he chose
disabled women,

10:12.613 --> 10:15.248
women who could not defend
themselves.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.551
That is beyond depraved,

10:17.584 --> 10:20.521
to revictimize victims
is one of the grossest

10:20.554 --> 10:22.188
affronts to humanity.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.957
And I am confident that,
once we're through

10:23.990 --> 10:25.191
presenting our case,

10:25.225 --> 10:26.593
you will deal with this man

10:26.627 --> 10:29.996
according to your sense
of justice,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.698
certainly not his.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.773
This would be where
you get up.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.777
Introduce me.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.846
I beg your pardon?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.081
I like to be introduced
in the beginning.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.019
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:53.053 --> 10:55.856
I give you Denny crane.

11:02.135 --> 11:04.738
The district attorney

11:04.771 --> 11:06.973
has made my client seem
like a horrible,

11:07.007 --> 11:08.975
disgusting, vile person.

11:09.009 --> 11:12.112
When I get done,
when I have had my say,

11:12.145 --> 11:13.614
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

11:13.647 --> 11:15.516
when you have finished listening

11:15.549 --> 11:17.350
to what I have to say
to you right now,

11:17.383 --> 11:19.152
this very minute,

11:19.185 --> 11:22.322
he will seem far
less disgusting,

11:22.355 --> 11:24.791
far less horrible,

11:24.825 --> 11:26.860
and won't seem vile at all.

11:28.795 --> 11:30.196
Denny crane.

11:40.907 --> 11:41.975
You're quitting?

11:42.008 --> 11:45.445
FRUTT: Not quitting,
it's just--

11:45.478 --> 11:47.213
with Eugene
becoming a judge,

11:47.247 --> 11:49.382
it's made me think
about what I want to do

11:49.415 --> 11:50.917
with my life.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.619
Which is...

11:52.653 --> 11:54.521
Time with my daughter,

11:54.555 --> 11:56.623
so I'm thinking
about taking a hiatus

11:56.657 --> 11:58.091
from practicing law.

11:58.859 --> 11:59.926
That's great.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.067
I think so.

12:03.403 --> 12:05.772
But with Jimmy
and Eugene gone,

12:06.773 --> 12:08.975
if I leave the firm,

12:09.009 --> 12:10.644
your firm, then it's over.

12:10.677 --> 12:13.146
It's not my firm. I--

12:13.179 --> 12:14.815
Bobby.

12:14.848 --> 12:16.449
What's Jamie gonna do?

12:16.482 --> 12:18.118
She's volunteering
at Jimmy's.

12:18.151 --> 12:19.886
She may even end up
working there.

12:21.321 --> 12:23.657
So you're okay if I take
some time off?

12:24.324 --> 12:26.627
Ellenor,
why are you asking me

12:26.660 --> 12:29.930
to approve of what you do
with your life?

12:29.963 --> 12:31.464
Come on, Bobby.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.634
You founded that place.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.803
You took a chance with me.

12:36.837 --> 12:37.971
I couldn't--
I moved on,

12:38.004 --> 12:39.540
and if you want time
to be with Zoey,

12:39.573 --> 12:41.775
I'm all for it,
I promise you.

12:43.443 --> 12:44.845
I don't believe you.

12:46.547 --> 12:48.348
I'm sorry, but I don't.

12:48.381 --> 12:50.083
If this is firm ends--

12:50.116 --> 12:53.119
Everything has to end
sometime, Ellenor.

12:53.153 --> 12:54.755
I'm fine with it.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.292
She got fatter.

12:59.325 --> 13:01.301
TORELLI:
I did not get fatter.

13:01.334 --> 13:02.636
You did, Angelina.

13:02.669 --> 13:04.470
I did not.
Hold on, here.

13:04.505 --> 13:06.239
We're not gonna get into
issues of girth here.

13:06.272 --> 13:07.373
It ain't about that.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.242
If anything, I got thinner.

13:09.275 --> 13:12.212
Angelina, I need you to shut
your face now.

13:13.814 --> 13:15.415
We had a contract.

13:15.448 --> 13:17.350
You agreed to provide
services

13:17.383 --> 13:19.886
whereby you would make
this bride-to-be a dress.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.988
You didn't make that dress,
Eddie, that's a breach.

13:22.022 --> 13:23.323
There was a seamstress strike.

13:23.356 --> 13:24.991
What, am I talking
to myself here?

13:25.025 --> 13:27.460
That does not absolve you
of your legal duty

13:27.493 --> 13:29.362
to perform under
the contract.

13:30.196 --> 13:31.732
BRIMSEK: Well, maybe I
should get my own lawyer, then.

13:31.765 --> 13:33.066
PESCATORE: You could do that,

13:33.099 --> 13:34.568
but that's gonna cost
you more money.

13:34.601 --> 13:36.870
The contract says
what it says, Eddie.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.139
A lawyer's gonna charge
you 10 grand

13:39.172 --> 13:40.874
to tell you what
I'm already telling you,

13:40.907 --> 13:44.911
10 grand that could and should
be going to Angelina.

13:44.945 --> 13:46.713
40 grand and you're out
of this,

13:46.747 --> 13:48.348
what's not to think about?

13:48.381 --> 13:50.050
Well, I need to think about it.

13:51.084 --> 13:52.953
24 hours, no more.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.525
HOBBS: Sometimes,
it was subtle.

13:58.559 --> 14:01.768
He'd squeeze my shoulder,
my arms.

14:01.802 --> 14:04.437
Other times,
it was more blatant.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.607
ALEXANDER: Out in the open,
in front of people?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.174
Well, he would lean over
from behind

14:08.208 --> 14:10.076
to show me a document
or something.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.979
I don't think that it
was obvious to other people.

14:13.013 --> 14:15.015
ALEXANDER: And how did
it make you feel?

14:15.048 --> 14:18.552
Violated angry.

14:18.585 --> 14:20.120
Did you complain about it?

14:20.153 --> 14:23.657
Yes, and then a week
or so later,

14:23.690 --> 14:25.291
he just kissed me,

14:25.325 --> 14:27.193
put his tongue in my mouth,

14:27.227 --> 14:29.730
and that's when I went
to the police.

14:30.531 --> 14:31.698
Thank you, Ms. Hobbs.

14:33.734 --> 14:37.070
I am begging you not
to employ this tactic.

14:37.103 --> 14:40.106
Son, cross-examination
is what heats my swimming pool.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.709
Understood, but this
particular line of attack--

14:42.743 --> 14:43.744
Counsel?

14:44.444 --> 14:45.579
Yes, Your Honor.

14:48.248 --> 14:49.883
Just a few questions,
Ms. Hobbs.

14:49.916 --> 14:51.251
WEST: What the--

14:51.284 --> 14:53.587
where did you get that thing?

14:53.620 --> 14:55.822
I had it put there during
the last recess, Your Honor.

14:55.856 --> 14:59.059
Get out of that chair now,
Mr. Crane.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.804
Ms. Hobbs and members
of the jury,

15:03.837 --> 15:05.806
I apologize
for that tasteless,

15:05.839 --> 15:08.374
offending display.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.945
Mr. Crane,
you will conduct yourself

15:11.978 --> 15:13.313
with the integrity that goes

15:13.346 --> 15:15.582
with the decorum of this room.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.251
I apologize, Your Honor.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.789
The reason I got
in that chair,

15:22.823 --> 15:24.925
last night, I tried to put
myself in your place,

15:24.958 --> 15:26.459
and I realized
that's impossible.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.429
We can't get a clue
of what it's like

15:29.462 --> 15:31.164
to live life in a wheelchair

15:31.197 --> 15:33.499
without actually being in one.

15:33.534 --> 15:36.970
And you think after spending
an hour in one, you know?

15:37.003 --> 15:39.506
No, I said I was searching
for a clue,

15:39.540 --> 15:43.777
the truth is,
I simply can't imagine.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.580
So much of my personal esteem

15:46.613 --> 15:49.449
goes into vanity.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.618
I don't like to admit that.

15:51.652 --> 15:52.653
I like to think of myself

15:52.686 --> 15:56.056
as an attractive, strong man.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.192
Ms. Hobbs, I noticed
in the last place you worked,

15:59.225 --> 16:01.635
you filed a claim
for sexual harassment

16:01.668 --> 16:03.303
against a couple of men

16:03.336 --> 16:05.471
who were harassing not you
but other women,

16:05.506 --> 16:06.707
am I correct in that?

16:06.740 --> 16:09.042
The fact that I wasn't
specifically targeted

16:09.075 --> 16:10.977
doesn't mean
that I wasn't victimized.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.513
Understood. But did it hurt

16:12.546 --> 16:14.681
that you weren't
a specific target?

16:14.715 --> 16:18.384
I'm no therapist,
but did it hurt

16:18.418 --> 16:21.287
that these men were declaring
their attraction

16:21.321 --> 16:24.257
to all these women but you?

16:26.292 --> 16:28.729
My mother used to tell me,

16:28.762 --> 16:30.597
and feel free to disagree,

16:30.631 --> 16:32.899
the woman was batty,

16:33.567 --> 16:36.469
she told me that
if there was anything

16:36.503 --> 16:39.205
worse for a woman

16:39.239 --> 16:43.677
than being regarded
as a sexual object,

16:43.710 --> 16:45.779
it's not being regarded as one.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.682
Any truth in that?

16:50.984 --> 16:52.485
Perhaps a little.

16:57.090 --> 16:59.459
In spite of himself,
he's actually quite good.

16:59.492 --> 17:01.835
I mean, sometimes,
I am mystified,

17:01.868 --> 17:03.804
but by the end,

17:03.837 --> 17:05.906
he knows what he's doing.

17:05.939 --> 17:08.008
By suggesting that the women
wanted to be groped

17:08.040 --> 17:09.442
because they were in
wheelchairs?

17:09.474 --> 17:12.444
He mined a very universal
and human truth,

17:12.478 --> 17:14.146
we all want to be desired.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.415
I'm not saying
he won the day,

17:15.448 --> 17:18.618
but the man...

17:19.786 --> 17:21.887
seems to know what he's doing.

17:23.289 --> 17:27.227
Well, speaking of the day...

17:27.260 --> 17:29.062
it's over.

17:29.095 --> 17:30.664
Would you like to get
some dinner?

17:30.697 --> 17:32.899
SHORE: Uh, no.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.935
Thank you. No.

17:38.238 --> 17:40.373
I've got more to do here.

17:42.175 --> 17:43.476
All right, then.

17:44.811 --> 17:46.346
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:47.914 --> 17:49.315
Tara...

17:52.586 --> 17:55.656
I know, um...

17:55.689 --> 17:59.092
the normal course of behavior

17:59.125 --> 18:01.868
when a person
declares feelings,

18:01.902 --> 18:05.338
a conversation would typically
ensue, shedding--

18:05.806 --> 18:09.042
I get it, Alan.

18:09.075 --> 18:11.177
May I just offer one thing?

18:12.112 --> 18:13.446
Okay.

18:13.479 --> 18:15.949
I agree that you and I
wouldn't be a good idea

18:15.982 --> 18:17.984
and that we could never work.

18:18.952 --> 18:20.386
And the reason
why I brought up dinner

18:20.420 --> 18:22.956
just the same,

18:22.989 --> 18:24.625
I have urges.

18:25.559 --> 18:27.160
Alan...

18:29.162 --> 18:31.932
I guess what I'm trying
to say Alan is...

18:34.535 --> 18:36.136
I'm hungry.

18:37.470 --> 18:38.572
I need food.

18:55.956 --> 18:58.759
BILLINGS: Did you give
Hannah Rose illegal marijuana?

18:58.792 --> 19:00.534
She promised she wouldn't
glamorize it.

19:02.035 --> 19:03.604
I got to tell you, Sally,

19:03.637 --> 19:06.072
for someone who claims
to want to succeed here,

19:06.106 --> 19:07.874
you seem to be doing
everything you can

19:07.908 --> 19:08.942
to sabotage your career.

19:08.975 --> 19:11.411
Look, she asked me
for the stuff.

19:11.444 --> 19:13.113
That's an unacceptable
response,

19:13.146 --> 19:14.915
especially from an attorney.

19:14.948 --> 19:16.750
For the next week,
you will not practice,

19:16.783 --> 19:17.718
you will file.

19:18.318 --> 19:19.285
Change into some
old clothes.

19:19.319 --> 19:20.486
You're going to storage.

19:21.021 --> 19:22.889
Be grateful it isn't jail.

19:29.095 --> 19:29.996
STRINGER:
What am I looking at?

19:30.030 --> 19:31.297
QUINN: Dottie Hatt's "x" rays,

19:31.331 --> 19:32.265
they're beautiful.

19:32.298 --> 19:34.067
Look at the L-5,
it's bulging.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.636
Dottie hasn't even
been X-rayed yet.

19:35.669 --> 19:37.470
She goes this afternoon,
it's taken care of.

19:37.504 --> 19:39.272
Well, how do we get film

19:39.305 --> 19:40.507
before they've ever taken
pictures?

19:40.541 --> 19:41.842
What is this,
twenty questions?

19:41.875 --> 19:43.710
Do you want to, like,
go to a movie or something?

19:43.744 --> 19:44.978
Aren't you married?

19:45.011 --> 19:46.279
Yeah, we won't tell.

19:46.312 --> 19:48.815
PAPONI: Lenny,
Eddie Brimsek's here.

19:48.849 --> 19:50.884
PESCATORE:
Eddie, right this way.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.252
I hope you got cash.

19:52.285 --> 19:53.654
I ain't paying nothing,
Lenny.

19:53.687 --> 19:55.722
What's that?
My hearing just failed me.

19:55.756 --> 19:57.457
I did call a lawyer of my own,
and he said that,

19:57.490 --> 19:58.859
as long as I refunded
the money--

19:58.892 --> 20:00.433
QUINN: That don't cover
the pain and suffering.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.367
PESCATORE: I'll take care
of this, Manny.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.503
That woman had to get

20:02.536 --> 20:03.670
married wearing a sack.

20:03.704 --> 20:04.671
Shut up.
BRIMSEK: You know what?

20:04.705 --> 20:05.906
There's no dress known
to man

20:05.939 --> 20:07.808
that's gonna make that bus
look good, she's a cow.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.743
All right, let's go into
the conference room.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.678
No, I think I'm gonna take
this meeting alone.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.213
BRIMSEK: You can cover
a sow with satin.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.581
You don't get no silk purse.

20:14.615 --> 20:15.916
It's time to settle.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.552
Jimmy...

20:18.585 --> 20:20.554
it's really not ethical for him
to not be represented.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.088
Well, he's representing
himself.

20:22.122 --> 20:22.989
He can do that.

20:23.023 --> 20:24.758
Dottie has x-rays
without ever having been

20:24.791 --> 20:26.026
to a doctor or a hospital.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.328
I'll look into it.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.397
Do we break laws?

20:32.498 --> 20:33.800
PESCATORE:
You want to do this?!

20:33.834 --> 20:34.535
Hey!

20:35.602 --> 20:36.803
Let them work it out.
BERLUTI: Let me go, Manny!

20:36.837 --> 20:38.238
QUINN: These guys know
each other, Jimmy.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.272
They're gonna kiss
and make up, I promise.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.907
Take your hands off me now!

20:40.941 --> 20:42.475
Look, they're already over it.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.881
QUINN: Nobody here saw nothing,

20:47.914 --> 20:49.049
I don't got to say that.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.952
BERLUTI:
Manny, you don't work here.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.486
PESCATORE:
We had some movement.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.990
Eddie's gonna come back
with a bigger number.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.760
So, you think
about that movie?

20:59.793 --> 21:02.936
(indistinct chatter)

21:08.108 --> 21:08.909
You remember Bobby.

21:08.942 --> 21:10.410
Say hi.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.645
Hi.

21:11.678 --> 21:13.479
Hi, sweetheart.

21:13.514 --> 21:15.448
Aw.

21:15.481 --> 21:16.817
You're so beautiful.

21:16.850 --> 21:19.052
(chuckling)

21:19.085 --> 21:20.887
Hey, can you draw
a picture for mom?

21:20.921 --> 21:23.156
Okay.
Right over there.

21:23.189 --> 21:24.991
Does this mean
you've already left?

21:25.025 --> 21:26.459
Well, I'm packing.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.429
Listen, tomorrow,

21:29.462 --> 21:31.397
Eugene, Jimmy,
Jamie, and I

21:31.431 --> 21:33.066
we're having a little

21:33.099 --> 21:35.168
goodbye celebration
at the end of the day.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.036
Can you stop by?

21:36.069 --> 21:38.805
Well, tomorrow,
I'm kind of jammed.

21:39.573 --> 21:40.974
Well, we can work
around you.

21:41.007 --> 21:42.342
Eugene is in trial, but--

21:42.375 --> 21:44.110
I'm pretty much booked
all day.

21:45.245 --> 21:46.479
How about tomorrow night?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.715
Actually, I have plans.

21:50.016 --> 21:51.317
You guys do it without me.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.452
I, you know,

21:52.485 --> 21:54.187
I already said goodbye.

21:55.956 --> 21:57.423
Actually, you didn't.

21:57.457 --> 21:59.225
You never really did
say goodbye.

21:59.259 --> 22:00.667
In fact,
you made a big point

22:00.701 --> 22:02.235
about how it wasn't
goodbye.

22:02.268 --> 22:04.605
Ellenor, I'm not really into
that kind of stuff.

22:04.638 --> 22:05.972
What kind of stuff?

22:06.006 --> 22:07.307
Look,

22:07.340 --> 22:10.577
I've moved on, okay?

22:10.611 --> 22:12.412
I don't really feel like
going backwards.

22:12.445 --> 22:15.348
It's reflecting on a franchise
that we gave our lives to.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.551
It isn't our lives.

22:17.584 --> 22:19.786
It's an office place.

22:19.820 --> 22:20.821
Fine.

22:22.222 --> 22:24.157
(sighs)

22:24.190 --> 22:25.526
All right,
tell me what time,

22:25.559 --> 22:27.227
and I'll try to swing by

22:27.260 --> 22:29.162
to toast you and Eugene

22:29.195 --> 22:31.865
and Jimmy and Jamie.

22:31.898 --> 22:33.634
To me, it's--

22:33.667 --> 22:35.301
it's about people,

22:35.335 --> 22:36.503
not a space.

22:36.537 --> 22:39.405
I don't need to say goodbye
to a space.

22:43.109 --> 22:45.045
Actually, he's more aroused
by the wheelchair

22:45.078 --> 22:46.513
than he is by the women.

22:46.547 --> 22:47.714
CRANE: By the wheelchair?

22:47.748 --> 22:49.550
Well, that makes him
even sicker, doesn't it?

22:49.583 --> 22:51.552
Essentially, it's a fetish,

22:51.585 --> 22:52.786
and it's not all
that uncommon.

22:52.819 --> 22:54.955
Being aroused
by a wheelchair?

22:54.988 --> 22:57.057
Mr. Shepley was raised

22:57.090 --> 22:58.424
by a working mom,

22:58.458 --> 22:59.760
typically absent

22:59.793 --> 23:01.935
during critical stages
of his development.

23:01.968 --> 23:05.238
Now, he himself
was injured as a child,

23:05.271 --> 23:07.874
and his mother became
more present for him

23:07.908 --> 23:10.076
then, tending to him.

23:10.110 --> 23:13.146
Long story short, without
all of the psychological detail,

23:13.179 --> 23:16.650
Mr. Shepley likes
to imagine himself

23:16.683 --> 23:18.519
in a helpless state.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.555
So, it's possible that
he couldn't help himself,

23:21.588 --> 23:22.756
is that what
you're saying, doctor,

23:22.789 --> 23:24.090
that he goes on
some sort of

23:24.124 --> 23:26.159
sicko automatic perv pilot?

23:26.192 --> 23:27.961
Objection.
Sustained.

23:27.994 --> 23:30.597
DOCTOR: I can't speak
to whether his actions

23:30.631 --> 23:31.898
were voluntary or not.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.299
It seems that they were,

23:33.333 --> 23:36.036
but when he sees a woman

23:36.069 --> 23:38.204
physically disabled,

23:38.238 --> 23:40.340
he becomes
sexually excited.

23:42.876 --> 23:44.911
Am I ready to plead?

23:44.945 --> 23:46.513
The jury has a legal right

23:46.547 --> 23:48.114
to free him
if they want to,

23:48.148 --> 23:49.182
and that's where
I come in.

23:49.215 --> 23:50.350
When I get up to speed,

23:50.383 --> 23:51.417
they're gonna want
to let him go.

23:51.451 --> 23:53.787
You think?
It's our nature, Susan.

23:53.820 --> 23:54.855
We're Americans.

23:54.888 --> 23:56.823
It's our God-given duty
to free people,

23:56.857 --> 23:59.760
even if they don't
particularly want to be freed.

23:59.793 --> 24:02.335
We're liberators
at our core, Susan.

24:04.938 --> 24:06.607
I'll ask you not to stand
so close to me.

24:08.975 --> 24:11.845
CRANE: All I need is one,
one juror

24:11.878 --> 24:14.114
who thinks that Walter Shepley
is a victim.

24:14.147 --> 24:16.550
Do you really want to bet
I can't get one?

24:20.887 --> 24:23.890
(phone ringing)

24:29.796 --> 24:30.997
Excuse me.

24:32.032 --> 24:32.899
Sally...

24:32.933 --> 24:34.768
I'm on K. P. Duty,

24:34.801 --> 24:37.170
punishment for giving
Hannah Rose some pot.

24:38.639 --> 24:40.874
You gave Hannah rose pot

24:40.907 --> 24:42.142
without offering me any?

24:43.744 --> 24:45.278
I'm banished
to the storage room.

24:45.311 --> 24:46.580
There were some
old files in here.

24:46.613 --> 24:48.815
I can come back
if you want.

24:48.849 --> 24:50.183
No, it's fine.

24:56.022 --> 24:57.190
What are you looking at?

25:00.133 --> 25:01.802
Youth.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.737
What?

25:03.770 --> 25:07.741
Sally, why would you give
Hannah Rose pot?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.375
(sighs)

25:09.409 --> 25:11.578
Maybe I'm a little
self-destructive.

25:11.612 --> 25:12.979
You'll be happy to know

25:13.013 --> 25:15.516
I've officially hired
a therapist.

25:15.549 --> 25:17.017
We've already
discussed you.

25:19.019 --> 25:19.820
And...

25:19.853 --> 25:21.888
He said I might be drawn
to old guys

25:21.922 --> 25:23.957
because it makes me feel safe.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.792
Did you say "old guys"?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.028
Sorry.

25:29.062 --> 25:31.565
Sexy old guys.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.567
I don't know
if I've ever been accused

25:33.600 --> 25:35.769
of that before in my life.

25:35.802 --> 25:36.903
Being sexy?

25:38.171 --> 25:39.039
Safe...

25:40.406 --> 25:42.843
I've never made anybody
feel safe.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.416
Remember
when I kissed you?

25:54.988 --> 25:56.256
Yes.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.391
And I said something like,

25:59.593 --> 26:00.934
"I can't believe
I just did that.

26:00.967 --> 26:02.769
It just sort of
happened."

26:04.004 --> 26:07.307
It was a little more
reflective than that.

26:08.842 --> 26:09.610
I lied.

26:11.745 --> 26:12.946
As did I.

26:12.979 --> 26:14.147
Remember my response?

26:14.180 --> 26:16.382
I said,
"That was a surprise."

26:16.416 --> 26:17.618
Well, I saw it coming.

26:18.151 --> 26:19.219
You didn't pull away.

26:19.252 --> 26:21.588
No, I didn't.

26:22.689 --> 26:23.824
Do you regret that

26:24.625 --> 26:25.726
not pulling away?

26:27.293 --> 26:29.062
Did you say
to yourself after,

26:29.095 --> 26:30.931
"Next time,
I'll pull away"?

26:34.234 --> 26:35.702
No, I didn't say that.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.640
(music playing)

27:07.040 --> 27:09.409
Please don't ask
to discuss my feelings.

27:11.512 --> 27:14.480
You kiss nice
for an old guy.

27:31.832 --> 27:33.066
I'm not the actual lawyer.

27:33.099 --> 27:34.167
You'll have to talk to
one of the boys about that.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.536
He brings in cases.

27:35.569 --> 27:37.137
Fraud cases.

27:37.170 --> 27:39.305
He's got doctors
on the take.

27:39.339 --> 27:41.174
We don't need to know
none of that.

27:41.207 --> 27:42.976
We want to help people
that need help.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.144
We need cash flow.

27:44.177 --> 27:45.579
That man over there
is a cash cow.

27:45.612 --> 27:46.613
Look at the size of him.

27:50.517 --> 27:53.019
Mr. Crane told me
you'd acquit his client

27:53.053 --> 27:54.788
because you're Americans

27:54.821 --> 27:56.422
and it's your God-given duty

27:56.456 --> 27:58.091
to free people.

27:58.124 --> 27:59.325
It's our nature.

28:00.934 --> 28:02.869
And it got me thinking,

28:02.903 --> 28:04.104
"What is our nature

28:04.805 --> 28:06.607
as Americans?"

28:06.640 --> 28:08.441
And I realized

28:08.474 --> 28:09.843
this man

28:09.876 --> 28:12.312
degraded people
in wheelchairs.

28:12.345 --> 28:14.080
It isn't his fault,

28:15.148 --> 28:16.783
it's yours

28:16.817 --> 28:18.284
and yours

28:18.318 --> 28:19.419
and mine...

28:19.452 --> 28:21.287
because we, as Americans,

28:21.321 --> 28:22.488
tolerate it.

28:24.257 --> 28:26.793
My husband
is a staunch republican.

28:26.827 --> 28:28.862
He championed the war
and put out the flag.

28:28.895 --> 28:32.298
"We need to protect
freedom," he says.

28:32.332 --> 28:35.468
And then, when no weapons
of mass destruction were found,

28:35.501 --> 28:39.072
he said, "How could they make
such a horrible mistake?"

28:39.105 --> 28:41.542
"We" in success,

28:41.575 --> 28:43.677
"They" in failure.

28:44.945 --> 28:46.513
It needs to always

28:46.547 --> 28:48.114
be "We."

28:48.148 --> 28:50.617
You look at those pictures
in the papers

28:50.651 --> 28:54.020
of those Iraqi prisoners
degraded,

28:54.054 --> 28:55.188
some sodomized,

28:55.221 --> 28:57.023
some killed.

28:57.057 --> 28:58.659
We did that.

28:58.692 --> 29:00.200
Americans did that.

29:01.067 --> 29:03.269
As long as we lay
claim to be a nation

29:03.303 --> 29:05.205
governed by the people,

29:05.238 --> 29:07.440
for the people...

29:07.473 --> 29:10.744
the American people did that.

29:10.777 --> 29:11.978
You did.

29:12.012 --> 29:14.214
You did. I did.

29:14.247 --> 29:16.650
Your honor, this is disguised
bush-bashing.

29:16.683 --> 29:18.318
I ask that counsel
be disbarred,

29:18.351 --> 29:19.520
effective immediately.

29:19.553 --> 29:22.556
Could you bring it back
to the case, counsel?

29:23.223 --> 29:26.259
We all need to be held
accountable for a society

29:26.292 --> 29:28.829
that allows
Mr. Shepley's behavior

29:28.862 --> 29:30.396
to be excusable.

29:31.397 --> 29:34.735
This is not about
political correctness.

29:34.768 --> 29:37.871
I don't care
what your politics are.

29:37.904 --> 29:40.907
Go in that room
and vote your conscience.

29:40.941 --> 29:42.509
Cast a vote that says,

29:42.543 --> 29:45.211
"Our society is a moral one."

29:46.913 --> 29:48.481
Clearly...

29:48.515 --> 29:51.451
we cannot claim the higher road
abroad these days.

29:53.153 --> 29:56.422
Let's at least be able
to cling to it at home.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.039
Did she attack America?

30:06.072 --> 30:07.608
I believe she did, yes.

30:07.641 --> 30:10.076
Son, this has to be
rebutted cogently,

30:10.110 --> 30:12.145
thoughtfully,
intelligently.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.180
I agree.

30:14.214 --> 30:15.816
Son, I'm not equipped.

30:16.817 --> 30:19.152
(inhales deeply)

30:24.090 --> 30:26.326
In her opening statement,
Ms. Alexander suggested

30:26.359 --> 30:28.529
that my client
should be held accountable.

30:28.562 --> 30:30.531
Now, it seems,

30:30.564 --> 30:31.665
she's saying

30:31.698 --> 30:33.266
you should be accountable.

30:34.735 --> 30:36.670
Please. We, as Americans,

30:36.703 --> 30:38.371
are not accountable people.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.807
We are a nation
of finger-pointers,

30:40.841 --> 30:42.709
be it the 9/11 commission

30:42.743 --> 30:44.878
to the weapons
of mass destruction

30:44.911 --> 30:48.314
to anything at all
having to do with the Red Sox.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.250
When was the last time
you heard anybody say,

30:50.283 --> 30:51.351
"I screwed up"?

30:51.384 --> 30:52.919
When was the last time
you heard anybody say,

30:52.953 --> 30:53.887
"We screwed up"?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.222
This is America,
for God's sake.

30:56.256 --> 30:57.658
We're always right,

30:57.691 --> 30:59.159
and if ever we're not,

30:59.192 --> 31:00.701
we get a note from our doctor.

31:01.668 --> 31:04.037
Well, my client

31:04.070 --> 31:05.471
comes to you

31:05.506 --> 31:07.340
with a note
from his doctor.

31:07.373 --> 31:09.543
He has a medical condition.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.377
It's a mental disorder.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.714
If, as Ms. Alexander
suggests,

31:13.747 --> 31:15.348
we, as a society,

31:15.381 --> 31:17.283
should take responsibility

31:17.317 --> 31:19.019
here in this case

31:19.052 --> 31:20.453
in this courtroom,

31:20.486 --> 31:22.055
then let's get this man
some treatment.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.490
Let's not put him in jail.

31:27.528 --> 31:28.695
I could be wrong,

31:28.729 --> 31:30.564
but retribution

31:30.597 --> 31:33.199
doesn't always seem to work.

31:47.213 --> 31:47.981
(knock on door)

31:48.014 --> 31:48.715
Yeah?

31:48.749 --> 31:49.983
(door opens)

31:51.752 --> 31:52.853
(door closes)

31:52.886 --> 31:54.187
I thought you'd be
interested to know

31:54.220 --> 31:55.656
despite my stirring closing,

31:55.689 --> 31:57.190
we decided to settle the case.

31:57.223 --> 31:58.959
You're wrong.
I'm not interested.

31:58.992 --> 32:00.060
Get out.

32:00.093 --> 32:02.569
Eugene...
A judge...

32:02.603 --> 32:05.405
has asked you
to leave his chambers.

32:08.108 --> 32:10.711
Whatever our history,
if you ever again--

32:13.780 --> 32:14.848
What did I do?

32:17.350 --> 32:18.619
What did you do?

32:20.554 --> 32:22.088
You called me "Eugene."

32:22.122 --> 32:23.824
You mean
that's not your name?

32:23.857 --> 32:24.591
I was under the impression--

32:24.625 --> 32:25.692
Shut up!

32:25.726 --> 32:26.993
Just shut up!

32:30.230 --> 32:32.165
I walk in that courtroom,

32:32.198 --> 32:34.300
my courtroom
for the first time,

32:34.334 --> 32:36.503
and you yell out,
"Eugene! Buddy!"

32:38.238 --> 32:40.273
You may not respect me,
but you'll respect the robe.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.575
Do you understand?

32:44.177 --> 32:46.379
I yelled your name
out of enthusiasm.

32:48.481 --> 32:50.483
I yelled out, "Buddy,"
to be flip.

32:50.517 --> 32:51.785
I apologize.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.722
Let me tell you something,
Eugene--

32:55.756 --> 32:56.723
I know many judges--

32:56.757 --> 32:58.358
I've even slept with a few.

32:58.391 --> 32:59.926
The robe is a piece of clothing.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.335
I'm required by law,

33:02.368 --> 33:04.304
and, I suppose, decorum,

33:04.337 --> 33:05.506
to honor the robe.

33:05.539 --> 33:07.373
The respect I have for you

33:07.407 --> 33:09.676
is far more profound...

33:14.180 --> 33:15.481
Your Honor.

33:21.922 --> 33:23.023
(door closes)

33:25.091 --> 33:26.760
There will be no violence

33:26.793 --> 33:28.662
inside the premises.

33:28.695 --> 33:30.163
I realize sometimes

33:30.196 --> 33:31.397
scores got to get settled

33:31.431 --> 33:33.099
outside the courtroom,

33:33.133 --> 33:36.036
but there will be no mayhem
inside here.

33:36.069 --> 33:37.738
Everybody checks
their baseball bats

33:37.771 --> 33:39.072
with Suzi when you come in.

33:39.105 --> 33:40.941
We have company bats?

33:40.974 --> 33:43.710
BERLUTI: Second, our mission

33:43.744 --> 33:47.714
is to become a totally
honest law firm.

33:47.748 --> 33:49.683
I know this can't happen
overnight,

33:49.716 --> 33:52.118
but the purpose
of this franchise

33:52.152 --> 33:54.588
is to do good, decent work

33:54.621 --> 33:56.222
for good, decent people.

33:56.256 --> 33:58.592
PESCATORE: I need to preclear
three wise guys

33:58.625 --> 34:00.466
I got lifelong stuff with--

34:00.500 --> 34:01.935
nothing serious.

34:01.968 --> 34:03.704
Third,

34:03.737 --> 34:05.806
Manny, we have agreed

34:05.839 --> 34:08.675
to extend an offer to you
as a paralegal.

34:08.708 --> 34:09.676
You mean it?

34:09.710 --> 34:11.377
BERLUTI:
You need to preclear with me

34:11.411 --> 34:12.612
everything you do.

34:12.646 --> 34:14.648
You'll be acting
as an agent of this firm.

34:14.681 --> 34:16.683
Your salary will
be a contingency

34:16.717 --> 34:17.884
of the business you bring in.

34:17.918 --> 34:19.753
You won't regret it.

34:19.786 --> 34:22.054
BERLUTI: Fourth, Jamie,

34:22.088 --> 34:23.356
if you want to be a partner,

34:23.389 --> 34:25.257
the buy-in is 75 grand.

34:25.291 --> 34:26.659
That's what me
and Lenny put in.

34:26.693 --> 34:29.429
You might want to consider,

34:29.462 --> 34:32.197
you know, being an
associate here, since--

34:32.232 --> 34:33.734
Yeah, I opt for that...

34:33.766 --> 34:35.569
(clears throat)
associate.

34:35.601 --> 34:37.203
BERLUTI: Okay.

34:37.237 --> 34:38.705
Then...

34:38.739 --> 34:40.440
we're a law firm.

34:40.473 --> 34:41.675
Let's...

34:44.143 --> 34:45.812
we're a law firm.

34:52.418 --> 34:53.987
I don't hug.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.989
When men hug,
it's a sign of homosexuality.

34:57.023 --> 34:58.692
I'm against same-sex hugs.

34:58.725 --> 35:00.534
I'll take a handshake, then.

35:03.537 --> 35:05.438
You spoke of your esteem,

35:05.471 --> 35:08.208
finding it in vanity.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.611
I've found much of mine

35:10.644 --> 35:12.212
in being your friend...

35:13.847 --> 35:16.449
friend of Denny Crane.

35:18.218 --> 35:19.520
ROSE: I've pushed the defense
on Peters

35:19.553 --> 35:21.287
as far as I can, Denny.

35:21.321 --> 35:23.389
I'm gonna need you
to close.

35:23.423 --> 35:24.224
CRANE: Well, call a meeting.

35:24.257 --> 35:25.726
Get them all in here tomorrow.

35:25.759 --> 35:28.228
ROSE: You might actually be able
to do it with a phone call.

35:28.261 --> 35:30.196
CRANE: Bring the file
into my office.

35:30.230 --> 35:31.431
Let's do it.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.568
Okay, Walter,

35:34.601 --> 35:35.702
talk to you later.

35:35.736 --> 35:36.503
SHEPLEY: Okay.

35:38.171 --> 35:41.174
(indistinct chatter)

35:43.777 --> 35:44.678
(exhales deeply)

35:44.711 --> 35:46.046
I'm a mess.

35:46.079 --> 35:48.181
You're just
figuring this out?

35:49.550 --> 35:51.552
I mean,
I always thought I was

35:51.585 --> 35:52.786
functionally messed up.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.821
It worked for me.

35:54.855 --> 35:56.523
But I...

35:56.557 --> 35:57.824
perhaps...

35:59.760 --> 36:01.034
well, there's no denying...

36:02.536 --> 36:04.270
actually, there is--

36:04.304 --> 36:07.407
there seems to be nothing
but denial on my part about--

36:12.312 --> 36:13.514
Tara...

36:17.250 --> 36:20.654
I have enormous
affection for you,

36:21.755 --> 36:24.324
but, for whatever reason...

36:26.960 --> 36:29.696
I like myself less
with you.

36:31.998 --> 36:34.467
I'm not at all sure--

36:37.771 --> 36:39.640
shouldn't you chime in
with something?

36:39.673 --> 36:41.542
Isn't that how
conversation works?

36:41.575 --> 36:43.309
You're doing fine.

36:44.978 --> 36:46.747
I don't like being alone.

36:46.780 --> 36:47.814
I'm good at it,

36:47.848 --> 36:49.082
but I don't like it.

36:51.017 --> 36:53.086
But...

36:53.119 --> 36:55.956
notwithstanding
my feelings for you,

36:55.989 --> 36:57.958
I see,

36:57.991 --> 36:59.860
potentially...

36:59.893 --> 37:03.302
a less lonely path with--

37:08.908 --> 37:10.977
I don't know what
I'm trying to say.

37:13.547 --> 37:15.014
You've just said it.

37:17.150 --> 37:20.186
Always take
the less lonely path.

37:21.988 --> 37:24.490
Somebody somewhere
must have said that.

37:27.661 --> 37:28.962
I'd love to stay and chat,

37:28.995 --> 37:30.831
but I'm buried with work.

37:32.566 --> 37:33.967
Could you be a dear?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.136
This file has to go down
to storage.

37:37.337 --> 37:38.972
Will you drop it down
there for me?

37:39.005 --> 37:42.008
(music playing)

38:15.081 --> 38:16.416
BERLUTI:
I thought Bec was coming.

38:16.449 --> 38:17.984
She got tied up
in probate.

38:18.018 --> 38:19.219
And Bobby?

38:19.252 --> 38:21.254
He won't show you know him
and goodbyes.

38:21.287 --> 38:22.355
He's still telling
Lindsay

38:22.388 --> 38:24.725
that their marriage
is just on hiatus.

38:24.758 --> 38:25.926
Well, we got to get going.

38:25.959 --> 38:26.960
I got to report
to night court.

38:26.993 --> 38:29.395
STRINGER: (gasps)
You got night court?

38:29.429 --> 38:30.597
I'm a rookie.

38:32.198 --> 38:33.399
All right, glasses up.

38:35.401 --> 38:36.970
To our new lives,

38:37.003 --> 38:38.739
Eugene,

38:38.772 --> 38:41.307
a judge,

38:41.341 --> 38:42.509
Jimmy, Jamie

38:42.543 --> 38:44.077
neighborhood lawyers,

38:44.110 --> 38:46.647
Me, a mom, and...

38:47.748 --> 38:48.949
who knows?

38:49.983 --> 38:50.751
And...

38:54.688 --> 38:56.823
come on, somebody help me out.

38:59.292 --> 39:01.234
YOUNG: Okay, uh...

39:03.436 --> 39:05.138
I have loved this place.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.242
Every day...

39:09.275 --> 39:11.177
no matter what
the fight or...

39:11.211 --> 39:12.846
however ugly,

39:12.879 --> 39:14.214
I came here every day

39:14.247 --> 39:15.749
saying to myself,

39:17.818 --> 39:19.252
"This place is special...

39:19.285 --> 39:21.955
and I'm lucky
to be here."

39:21.988 --> 39:23.657
And you

39:23.690 --> 39:25.391
and you

39:25.425 --> 39:27.293
and you...

39:27.327 --> 39:30.063
and all of you...

39:30.096 --> 39:31.397
um...

39:40.373 --> 39:41.675
cheers.
