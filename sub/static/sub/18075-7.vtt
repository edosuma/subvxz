00:02.718 --> 00:06.253
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:06.346 --> 00:07.971
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:08.058 --> 00:12.886
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:12.980 --> 00:16.599
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:16.693 --> 00:20.773
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:20.864 --> 00:22.904
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

02:42.987 --> 02:47.121
I don't understand why
we gotta come all the way down here.
This whole thing scares me.

02:47.242 --> 02:50.445
That Chinese man at the laundry
said we were supposed to stand here
until the bus comes.

02:50.537 --> 02:55.034
That's what he said. I don't know. Maybe
this wasn't such a hot idea after all.

02:55.126 --> 02:58.163
I don't like carrying
all this money around.

02:58.254 --> 03:00.247
I guess that's it.

03:18.027 --> 03:21.064
- Um...
- Somethin' wrong?

03:21.156 --> 03:26.234
Uh, no, no. We were just supposed
to be meeting somebody on this bus,
and it's empty.

03:26.329 --> 03:29.164
On or off, honey.
Don't matter to me.

03:29.249 --> 03:31.206
[Coins Jangle]

04:30.862 --> 04:33.863
[Bus Horn Honking]

04:52.553 --> 04:54.546
Follow me.

04:57.893 --> 04:59.969
I don't like this.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.397
You wanna hire the A-Team?

05:10.407 --> 05:12.365
Uh... Uh, yeah.

05:12.451 --> 05:15.655
We heard about you from some friends
in Arizona who were in Vietnam.

05:15.747 --> 05:19.531
And, uh, they said, well...

05:19.626 --> 05:22.628
We came to Los Angeles,
and we've been trying to locate you.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.999
We found somebody who said to go
to this laundry, and we met a man there.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.584
A Chinese man, Mr Lee.
And he said to get on the bus.

05:28.678 --> 05:31.252
Yes, I talked to Mr Lee.

05:31.348 --> 05:33.922
He told me you want us
to rescue your friend, Bruce Warfel?

05:34.018 --> 05:37.637
Professor Warfel spent
nearly two years feeding
mathematical probability theories...

05:37.731 --> 05:39.937
into the ASU computer.

05:40.025 --> 05:42.695
He thinks that he might have
found a system that'd beat roulette...

05:42.778 --> 05:46.029
chemin de fer and blackjack,
even with a three-deck shoe.

05:46.115 --> 05:50.695
It's a mathematical theory based on
the infinity concept of declining numbers.

05:50.787 --> 05:53.872
Don't look at me.
I always hit at 15, stand on 17.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.701
Okay, what else?

05:55.793 --> 05:58.629
- Sue Beth.
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

05:58.713 --> 06:03.175
He, uh, sent us this letter from Vegas
saying that the system worked.

06:03.260 --> 06:08.884
And with the letter he sent this
photograph. And then he just disappeared.

06:08.975 --> 06:12.427
The Xanadu Hotel doesn"t even have
a record of him ever staying there.

06:12.521 --> 06:16.353
We took the case to a detective agency
when the police couldn"t
turn up anything...

06:16.442 --> 06:19.527
and, well, the detective we hired
stayed on the case about two days,
and then he quit.

06:19.612 --> 06:23.942
- Why'd he quit?
- He quit because of that girl
in the picture.

06:24.034 --> 06:26.656
- Who's she?
- Gianni Christian"s girlfriend.

06:26.746 --> 06:30.198
That's what the detective said, anyway.
And, well, Gianni Christian is...

06:30.291 --> 06:33.293
We know who he is.
Biggest hood in Vegas. A real killer.

06:33.378 --> 06:38.622
Yeah. Well, anyway, the detective
was warned to drop the case.

06:38.718 --> 06:41.803
You see, wejust have to save the
professor. His mind"s a national resource.

06:43.598 --> 06:46.304
That's lucky.
His body's a national disaster.

06:46.393 --> 06:49.395
[Chuckles]

06:49.480 --> 06:52.980
- Just a joke.
- I'm sure you're all
very macho and everything...

06:53.068 --> 06:55.275
but we happen to appreciate
other qualities.

06:55.362 --> 06:59.028
I'm sorry about all you had
to go through to get to us.

06:59.116 --> 07:01.655
But if you still wanna hire us,
we'll do our best to find your friend.

07:02.996 --> 07:04.905
That's great.

07:04.998 --> 07:07.287
Uh... Oh. This is the money
that he sent us...

07:07.376 --> 07:09.784
out of his first winnings in Vegas.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.874
Oh, yeah.

07:16.011 --> 07:19.297
Let's call Murdock
and, uh, give it a shot.

07:27.024 --> 07:29.562
Pleasure meeting you, ladies.

07:32.488 --> 07:34.612
Do either of you girls
know how to drive a bus?

07:36.576 --> 07:39.993
Well, I was raised on a farm.
I can drive anything... a truck, combine.

07:40.081 --> 07:42.536
Well, if you wouldn't mind,
there's a rental invoice on the visor.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.535
Take the bus to the address on it.

07:44.627 --> 07:46.704
We'll be in touch.

07:50.843 --> 07:54.426
That's the damnedest ten minutes
I've ever had.

07:55.765 --> 07:57.758
[Murdock]
A seven. Pay the man.

07:57.851 --> 08:00.888
I got two... two hot dice...
two hot rocks.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.554
Oooh, and a winner!

08:06.444 --> 08:08.983
Another winner.
Pay the shooter.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.109
And these dice are hot!

08:14.787 --> 08:17.623
Seven again!

08:17.707 --> 08:21.243
Let her ride.
Daddy"s gonna buy a new Cadillac.

08:23.798 --> 08:26.503
That's right. Xanadu Hotel.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.918
Mm-hmm. A $200 floral display.

08:29.012 --> 08:32.049
It"s gotta be there in an hour.
Okay, here"s the message.

08:32.140 --> 08:36.222
Tony, you gave me the last
20 years of life.

08:36.312 --> 08:39.397
I owe you everything I am.
Anything goes wrong...

08:39.482 --> 08:42.235
you tell me and a head rolls.

08:42.318 --> 08:46.649
Sign that...
Your pal, Gianni Christian.

08:47.909 --> 08:50.531
Oh, uh, G-l-A...

08:50.620 --> 08:52.412
Double N...

08:52.498 --> 08:55.748
Thanks. N-N-I.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.587
Uh, Christian, yeah,
like in the Bible.

08:58.671 --> 09:03.500
Right. Send that to the main desk,
Xanadu Hotel for Mr Tony Vincent.

09:03.594 --> 09:05.670
Have you got my charge number?

09:05.763 --> 09:08.005
Wonderful. Bye.

09:09.184 --> 09:11.805
Oh, I'm hot. I'm hot.

09:11.895 --> 09:14.387
Them bones... Them bones...
Them shiny bones.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.985
Murdock, you better change
into your wardrobe.
We're gonna be there in an hour.

09:19.070 --> 09:21.941
What I roll, Face?

09:22.032 --> 09:24.274
- A couple of fours.
- Oh, another winner.

09:24.368 --> 09:26.575
Hard eight.
Pay the shooter.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.449
It was an eight.

09:29.540 --> 09:31.249
Look.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.176
Hood's from Atlantic City...
he just made the big time.

09:40.512 --> 09:44.759
I'm gonna play this guy like
the world has passed him by...

09:44.850 --> 09:47.388
until they licensed those casinos
on the boardwalk.

09:47.478 --> 09:50.183
Mr Tony Vincent...

09:50.273 --> 09:53.642
is nouveau big time,
and he loves it.

09:53.735 --> 09:56.061
It's really too bad
you're being chased by the military.

09:56.155 --> 09:59.109
You"re a terrific actor.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.074
I'm also very macho.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.115
You know, l"ve been looking through
these clippings on Gianni Christian...

10:04.206 --> 10:07.041
trying to find a chink in his armour,
but I gotta tell you.

10:07.126 --> 10:09.332
I don"t think we"re gonna find it.

10:09.420 --> 10:14.498
This guy is a security nut.
He"s going to and from his hotels
either in a helicopter or an armoured limo.

10:14.593 --> 10:18.093
- Yeah, but it could work for us.
- See, people who are paranoid
are easily manipulated...

10:18.180 --> 10:20.256
if you play on their very fears.

10:20.349 --> 10:23.516
Gianni Christian practically
runs Las Vegas.

10:23.603 --> 10:26.439
- That's absolutely terrifying.
- Yeah, I'm shaking all over.

10:26.523 --> 10:28.979
- [Hannibal] Face?
- Huh?

10:29.068 --> 10:31.025
Oh, yeah. Terrifying.

10:31.112 --> 10:33.069
Christian is not a man to be crossed.

10:33.156 --> 10:37.201
I'm sure he puts his pants on one leg
at a time just like the rest of us.

10:38.746 --> 10:41.996
Besides, we're getting paid
for this one.

11:51.038 --> 11:54.952
Tony? Tony, all I said was
Giorgio's has a store here.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.952
That's all I said, Tony.

11:57.044 --> 12:01.173
All you broads wanna do is burn money.
You spend it quicker than the Pentagon.

12:01.258 --> 12:04.343
All I said was, Tony,
that Giorgio's has a salon here.

12:04.428 --> 12:07.714
- Mr Vincent's here to be checked in.
- I'm sorry. What?

12:07.807 --> 12:11.556
Mr Tony Vincent and party
from Atlantic City.

12:11.645 --> 12:15.513
Uh, take a couple hundred.

12:15.608 --> 12:19.226
- Throw it on a number or somethin'.
- I only said Giorgio's has a store here.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.654
- I didn't say I wanted to buy nothin'.
- Get lost.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.197
Hey, sonny, you gonna
check us in this joint...

12:25.286 --> 12:27.777
or we just gonna stand around
and decorate the lobby?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.781
- Mr Vincent?
- Yeah.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.455
- He with you?
- He's my protection.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.250
We're supposed to be in here.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.666
We don't...
We don't have a reservation, sir.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.799
Nobody knew you were coming.

12:40.887 --> 12:43.176
This is for, uh, Mr Tony Vincent.

12:43.265 --> 12:45.258
That's me.

12:50.106 --> 12:52.858
Here. Thanks, kid.

12:54.319 --> 12:57.274
Obviously, somebody knew
I was comin'.

12:58.574 --> 13:01.825
I can't read nothin' no more.
Read that for me.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.904
Ah, let me see.

13:05.165 --> 13:07.573
"Tony, you gave me
the last 20 years of life.

13:07.668 --> 13:10.124
"I owe everything I am.
Anything goes wrong...

13:10.212 --> 13:13.962
you tell me and a head rolls."

13:14.050 --> 13:18.345
Signed..."Gianni Christian."

13:18.430 --> 13:23.058
Hey, Gianni sent me
a pot of flowers.

13:23.144 --> 13:25.636
- Ain't that nice?
- [Grunts]

13:26.815 --> 13:29.057
What a guy.

13:29.151 --> 13:32.521
Mr Vincent, we do have
the Elvis Presley Suite, top floor.

13:32.613 --> 13:36.279
It's reserved for friends
of Mr Christian's, and I'm sure
he'd like you to have that.

13:36.368 --> 13:39.155
You're a good scout, kiddo.
We'll take it.

13:39.246 --> 13:43.291
Hey, you got that picture
Gianni gave me. Remember?

13:44.419 --> 13:48.203
Gianni says he's got
a special chickola he wants me to try.

13:48.298 --> 13:50.208
Not bad, huh?

13:50.301 --> 13:52.424
Gianni can pick a pony,
can't he?

13:54.681 --> 13:57.053
Yes, this is Elly Payne.

13:57.142 --> 14:01.092
Yeah, Elly something.
That's what he said.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.181
Now...

14:04.358 --> 14:08.523
I want you to send Elly
up to the Presley place... the suite.

14:09.865 --> 14:13.733
- Tell her Tony Vincent
wants to have a good time.
- Front desk.

14:13.828 --> 14:16.746
Here. Take the broad to Giorgio's.

14:16.831 --> 14:19.749
- Keep her away from me
this afternoon, okay?
- Yes, sir, Mr Vincent.

14:31.181 --> 14:35.132
Send Elly Payne to me right away. And
have somebody try and find Mr Martell.

14:37.647 --> 14:40.565
We'll get the luggage.
You just close the door.

14:49.285 --> 14:51.859
Better sweep the place for bugs.

14:51.955 --> 14:54.281
That's right, Mr Martell.
He just checked in.

14:54.375 --> 14:57.875
- Tony Vincent, from the boardwalk?
- That's what he said.

14:57.962 --> 15:01.047
Mr Christian sent him
a big flower arrangement, some wine.

15:01.132 --> 15:03.540
And telegrams arrived
just after he checked in.

15:03.635 --> 15:07.171
Well, I've never heard of him, but it
could be legit. You know Mr Christian.

15:07.265 --> 15:10.432
Have someone from the switchboard put
a tap on that phone just to play it safe.

15:10.518 --> 15:14.386
- I'll check it out with Gianni.
- Yes, sir.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.602
Tony Vincent from the boardwalk?

15:26.412 --> 15:29.283
- [Woman] Xanadu Hotel.
- [Face] Tony Vincent"s room, please.

15:29.373 --> 15:32.209
[Woman] l"m connecting you
with Mr Vincent"s room.

15:32.294 --> 15:34.333
[Ringing]

15:34.421 --> 15:35.999
Yeah?

15:36.090 --> 15:38.925
It's Langley, 1650 code lock.

15:39.010 --> 15:43.055
Four score and seven years ago
our forefathers brought forth...

15:43.139 --> 15:45.713
on this continent a new nation.

15:45.809 --> 15:50.686
That's enough.
Stand by for, uh, computer voice check.

15:50.773 --> 15:53.181
[Beeping]

15:53.276 --> 15:58.188
Identity confirmed. Switch to verbal code
six for transmit reevaluation.

15:58.282 --> 16:02.446
Surveillance and set-up complete.
No recall.

16:02.537 --> 16:05.574
- Fail-safe full on.
- A- 1.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.908
Drop the pill.

16:28.692 --> 16:30.768
There goes Elly.

16:34.032 --> 16:36.867
Well, they should take about an hour
to run this game on her.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.657
You, uh, wanna shot some craps?

16:41.707 --> 16:46.536
I really got the jazz.
Boy, that was great running
the con on that hotel clerk.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.669
- I thought I was pretty good.
- You were fine.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.292
- Fine?
- Yeah. Fine.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.810
- Clean, B.A.?
- It's clean.

16:59.895 --> 17:03.062
- Better put the scrambler on the phone.
- It's just a toaster, man.

17:03.149 --> 17:06.435
She won"t know that.
Murdock, give me a hand.

17:06.528 --> 17:09.564
We want her to think it"s a command
centre for a government hit team.

17:38.982 --> 17:41.853
- [Knocking]
- Showtime.

17:41.944 --> 17:44.779
- B.A., get behind the door.
- What about me?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.189
I may need a lunatic.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.368
Act normal.
Hide behind the pillar.

17:50.453 --> 17:52.446
Put the lights down, B.A.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.744
Door's open.

17:58.838 --> 18:01.246
Mr Vincent, you there?

18:01.341 --> 18:04.046
Yeah. Close the door
and lock it...

18:04.136 --> 18:06.627
and turn on the lights, doll.

18:10.643 --> 18:12.636
Hi. I'm Elly.

18:14.147 --> 18:17.482
I was told you like to party.

18:17.568 --> 18:20.569
What kind of, uh, party
do you like?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.568
I like a legal party.

18:27.663 --> 18:29.822
Special Agent Tony Vincent.

18:29.916 --> 18:32.834
Why, you creep.
You got nothin' on me.

18:32.919 --> 18:35.921
Sit down and shut up, sister.
This isn't about hooking.

18:36.006 --> 18:38.676
You're damn right it isn't.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.881
Meet Special Agent Jones.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.768
Be cool, mama,
you won't get hurt.

18:49.855 --> 18:52.014
- What the hell is going on here?
- It's all over, Elly.

18:52.108 --> 18:54.315
You're one of Gianni Christian's
old girlfriends.

18:54.402 --> 18:58.650
I got 50 computerized pages
on him and you.

18:58.741 --> 19:01.113
Now, if you wanna cooperate with us...

19:01.202 --> 19:03.574
maybe I won't let Bongo here...

19:03.663 --> 19:06.451
do something really bad to you.

19:06.541 --> 19:09.211
Come on, man.
Now you said I could take her.

19:09.295 --> 19:11.537
You promised.
Come on, man.

19:11.631 --> 19:13.956
She's pretty, pretty...

19:14.050 --> 19:17.217
Look, I don't know what you guys want.
I'm just a working girl.

19:17.304 --> 19:20.091
We're from Washington.
We're a special hit squad.

19:20.182 --> 19:22.140
We"re in Vegas to take out
Gianni Christian.

19:22.226 --> 19:25.263
We"ve been on him
for five years.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.478
And that jerk stepped over
the line for the last time.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.318
You're gonna kill him?
You're supposed to be the law.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.858
We are.

19:32.947 --> 19:35.070
We're the executioners.

19:36.785 --> 19:39.110
Well, you ought to know one
when you see one, baby.

19:39.204 --> 19:42.823
How many bodies have you seen buried
in Nevada sand?

19:42.917 --> 19:45.788
Our records show you"re an accessory
to the murder of Tommy G...

19:45.879 --> 19:48.168
and you were actually there
when he was killed.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.712
What can I tell you?

19:50.801 --> 19:55.013
I wanna know how to get
into Gianni's back door
without becoming a media event.

19:55.098 --> 19:57.007
I wanna know
his whole security system.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.472
I wanna know his daily routine,
minute by minute.

19:59.561 --> 20:02.135
I figure a girl like you
knows about that.

20:02.231 --> 20:05.232
If I tell you how to get to Gianni,
he'll kill me.

20:05.318 --> 20:06.812
Let me take her.

20:06.903 --> 20:09.573
You said if she didn't help,
I could.

20:09.656 --> 20:12.326
Please?

20:12.409 --> 20:14.983
So pretty.

20:15.079 --> 20:18.662
- All right, all right, all right!
Just keep this thing away from me!
- Thing?

20:18.750 --> 20:21.288
Get him back, you hear?

20:21.378 --> 20:23.252
I'll tell you what I know.

20:24.465 --> 20:26.090
Speak up.

20:26.175 --> 20:29.296
[Face]
Verbal code lock 116, on and set.

20:29.387 --> 20:31.760
Alpha set lock 48-6.

20:31.848 --> 20:34.174
Transmit 1460.

20:36.729 --> 20:38.888
Am I supposed to know
what I'm listening to?

20:38.982 --> 20:41.520
It's what we got, Gianni.
Came right off the tap on their phone.

20:41.610 --> 20:44.232
These guys are calling Langley.
You heard.

20:44.321 --> 20:48.569
Sounds like some sort of code. Maybe
they're feds on some kind of operation.

20:51.538 --> 20:54.409
Whoever he is, he's making me
look like a fruit sundae.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.620
Taken the Presley Suite,
room service bills, credit at the tables.

20:57.712 --> 20:59.586
I'll tell Jilly to drop on 'em.

20:59.672 --> 21:02.211
Do it quietly,
and you bring 'em here.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.752
I'm dying to see my old friend
Mr Vincent from Atlantic City.

21:05.846 --> 21:07.922
It should be
a very interesting reunion.

21:08.015 --> 21:09.842
Done.

21:47.770 --> 21:50.391
Maid. Maid, señor.

21:50.481 --> 21:53.103
Sorry, mister. Towels.

21:53.193 --> 21:57.440
Hey, lady, there's a "Do Not Disturb" sign
on that door for a reason.

21:57.531 --> 21:59.903
Why don't you put the towels
in the bathroom.

21:59.992 --> 22:01.570
Freeze...

22:01.661 --> 22:04.448
or l"ll put a hole in you
I could drive through.

22:07.167 --> 22:10.122
- Who are you, her husband?
- Swallow it, punk.

22:10.212 --> 22:14.080
- [Punch Landing]
- You got no sense of humour, pal.

22:19.348 --> 22:21.222
Bring his clothes.

22:22.268 --> 22:24.676
[Face, Southern Accent]
We didn"t bring any clothes.

22:24.771 --> 22:27.974
Just a couple of toothbrushes
and my golf clubs.

22:28.066 --> 22:30.854
- Me and Peaches ain't gonna
need much to wear.
- Darling!

22:30.945 --> 22:33.518
Come on, jelly bug.
It's our anniversary.

22:33.614 --> 22:36.948
Now, you look it here.
It's the very same room with the view
of the Starlight Chapel...

22:37.035 --> 22:39.361
and the Xanadu Hotel
right across there.

22:39.454 --> 22:41.578
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Thanks, pal.

22:41.665 --> 22:45.498
Close the door on your way out
and hold our calls.

22:45.587 --> 22:47.745
- Yeah.
- [Door Closes]

22:47.839 --> 22:49.832
[Groans]

22:51.427 --> 22:54.761
- [Sighs] No wonder I never married.
- Thanks.

22:59.770 --> 23:04.148
- What do you think?
Look like a three wood to you?
- Uh-huh.

23:14.412 --> 23:16.404
I'll get the lights.

23:25.591 --> 23:28.628
That"s the place.
Right on the top.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.045
[Door Opens]

23:36.020 --> 23:39.306
I grabbed this thing
out of the room, Mr Christian.
It was attached to the phone.

23:39.399 --> 23:42.484
I think it's one of them scramblers.
I seen one just like it once...

23:42.569 --> 23:44.479
on Mission: lmpossible.

23:44.571 --> 23:46.730
And a couple of charts.

24:02.217 --> 24:05.302
Big shot, Mr Tony Vincent
from Atlantic City.

24:05.387 --> 24:09.635
You come in here. You make a mess
in my own house. You trying to
make me look like a jerk or what?

24:14.940 --> 24:17.063
You got a light?

24:20.989 --> 24:24.572
Your name swings open
a lot of doors in this town, Gianni.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.151
It also swings closed
a lot of caskets too.

24:27.246 --> 24:29.998
Now you're not gonna do that.
You're not that dumb.

24:30.082 --> 24:35.160
I figured the minute I tipped you
I was in town, you were all over
my phones, right? Wondering who I am?

24:35.255 --> 24:40.001
You know I called Langley,
and you know I made it too easy
for your monkeys to pick me up.

24:40.094 --> 24:45.053
Hey, maybe we just oughta have Jilly
dump this jamoke down a gopher hole.

24:45.142 --> 24:47.811
You're a fed,
but not a regular one.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.852
Look at this, charts...

24:49.939 --> 24:52.561
showing my movements
to and from the hotel...

24:52.650 --> 24:55.735
to my house,
vantage points, lines of fire.

24:55.821 --> 24:58.739
Looks like somebody's being
set up... for a hit.

24:58.824 --> 25:02.324
- But feds?
- We always suspected.

25:02.412 --> 25:06.077
- No one ever knew
who hit the Montana brothers.
- And Crazy Tommy T.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.496
You think he drowned on a fishing trip?
We sent him over Niagara Falls
with a rubber duck.

25:10.588 --> 25:13.957
And I'm the next target?

25:15.593 --> 25:17.883
What's to keep me from
blowing you away right here?

25:20.266 --> 25:23.137
Because right after that,
you'll get into your...

25:23.227 --> 25:25.801
secret elevator over here,
and the cable snaps.

25:25.897 --> 25:29.682
Or when your limo pulls out
to take you home...

25:29.777 --> 25:31.401
it blows up.

25:31.487 --> 25:35.236
And for a backup, someone who knows
that limo always goes home empty...

25:35.325 --> 25:38.160
puts something loud and noisy
in that blue Chevy Nova...

25:38.245 --> 25:41.412
in slot number two
with the fake employee"s name on it.

25:41.498 --> 25:46.291
Or maybe, uh, you're just
looking out the window.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.249
A hole in one.

25:56.474 --> 25:58.182
- Get out of here!
- But...

25:58.268 --> 26:00.842
Go!

26:11.825 --> 26:16.120
Now, let's talk about
why I'm really here...

26:16.205 --> 26:19.871
and why you're not
breathing dirt, Gianni.

26:21.128 --> 26:24.580
- Bruce Warfel.
- Warfel, the math guy?

26:24.673 --> 26:26.583
Yeah.

26:26.676 --> 26:29.463
When I came down here
scoping you out for burial...

26:29.554 --> 26:34.549
I found out you got this slide-rule genius
with the system.

26:34.643 --> 26:37.099
A good enough system...

26:37.188 --> 26:40.308
that maybe a retiring fed
could use it...

26:40.400 --> 26:42.938
to cushion his twilight years.

26:43.028 --> 26:46.611
This kind of government work
doesn"t pay that much.

26:46.699 --> 26:48.941
It's just fun.

26:50.036 --> 26:53.619
And you want me to hand over a guy
who could wipe me out in the casino?

26:53.707 --> 26:56.245
What kind of a choice is that?

26:58.629 --> 27:01.666
You don't understand, Gianni.
You're dead.

27:01.758 --> 27:04.629
You"re a wash if I leave town
without Warfel.

27:04.720 --> 27:09.299
Besides, I'd be willing
to leave your community.

27:09.392 --> 27:11.385
I'd take Warfel to Atlantic City.

27:12.646 --> 27:15.315
- You're out of your nut.
- Shut up!

27:15.399 --> 27:18.068
You think these guys are fooling around.
It's not you they're gunning for.

27:18.152 --> 27:20.940
I'll be at the blackjack table
nearest the front door...

27:21.030 --> 27:23.070
tomorrow afternoon at 6.00.

27:23.158 --> 27:25.151
If I decide to make
the exchange.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.651
If you don't...

27:27.746 --> 27:30.534
at 6.15 that's you.

27:32.377 --> 27:35.248
Think it over.

27:36.715 --> 27:38.755
Life is short.

27:52.233 --> 27:54.855
Hey, Frank.

27:54.944 --> 27:59.488
Cheap jerks. Anything to save
themselves a lousy buck tip.

28:03.621 --> 28:05.910
Hey, man, what you doing
banging on my ride?

28:05.999 --> 28:08.241
Huh? Oh. l...

28:08.335 --> 28:10.826
- I just was wondering
if you wanted us to park it.
- No!

28:10.921 --> 28:13.673
Oh. Thank you, sir.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.667
Thank you.

28:18.221 --> 28:21.721
- It's five after.
They're not going for it.
- I'm going in after Hannibal.

28:21.809 --> 28:24.265
Not yet, B.A.
They'll go for it.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.761
They have to.

28:44.460 --> 28:47.711
He looks okay.

28:49.549 --> 28:52.171
Well, howdy, Professor.

28:52.261 --> 28:54.420
How they been treating you?

28:54.513 --> 28:59.223
- Um, fine. Fine.
- Good.

28:59.311 --> 29:01.304
Come on.

29:05.484 --> 29:09.697
- Now who are you guys?
What do you want now?
- We came to take you home.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.988
Home? You really mean it?

29:12.075 --> 29:15.030
Save your questions until later.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.577
Hiya, Professor.
Regards from Sue Beth and Darlene.

29:17.665 --> 29:20.417
Sue Beth and Darlene?
They must be worried sick.

29:20.502 --> 29:23.040
- How are they? Are they okay?
- Terrific.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.883
[Glass Shattering]

29:39.816 --> 29:42.936
lt"s Gianni!
Gianni Christian!

29:47.366 --> 29:49.940
- So, uh, tell me, Professor.
- ## [Radio: Instrumental Rock]

29:50.036 --> 29:52.409
All the chicks at Arizona State
look like Sue Beth and Darlene?

29:52.497 --> 29:55.701
[British Accent] Thinking about
going back to college and getting
that education you never had?

29:55.793 --> 29:57.869
Maybe for a week or two anyway.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.370
- Am I really going home?
- [Allen] You sure are.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.039
I told you everything
would go down smoothly.

30:03.134 --> 30:07.085
B.A., can't you get anything with some
funky kind of sound on this thing?

30:07.181 --> 30:12.223
[Man] Just moments ago,
casino owner and reputed underworld
crime czar, Gianni Christian...

30:12.312 --> 30:16.559
fell to his death from
the penthouse suite of one
of his luxury hotels here in Las Vegas.

30:17.860 --> 30:20.980
Police already have a lead
to the suspected murderers.

30:21.072 --> 30:24.323
Four mystery men and a woman who
arrived in town yesterday afternoon...

30:24.409 --> 30:26.947
reporting to be friends
of Christian.

30:27.037 --> 30:29.244
The leader of the group
called himself Tony Vincent...

30:29.331 --> 30:31.621
from Atlantic City, New Jersey.

30:31.709 --> 30:34.117
Police have already verified
this is an alias...

30:34.212 --> 30:37.083
but they hope to know
Vincent"s true identity shortly...

30:37.174 --> 30:39.748
from a photo taken by one
of the casino security cameras.

30:39.844 --> 30:44.222
I don't think we're getting
out of this burg very easily.

30:49.271 --> 30:51.976
[B.A.] We have a smokey
to the left, Hannibal.

30:52.066 --> 30:55.233
[Hannibal] Hold it, B.A. If we run
this light, he"s gonna be on us.

31:00.534 --> 31:02.278
This is X-Ray 16.

31:02.370 --> 31:06.867
Have 187 on Xanadu Hotel suspect.
Vehicle in sight on Desert Valley Drive.

31:06.958 --> 31:09.366
- [Face] We"ve been made.
- Hang on, everybody.

31:11.672 --> 31:14.709
[Siren Wailing]

32:09.656 --> 32:12.028
[Hannibal]
B.A., did you lose him?

32:13.202 --> 32:15.527
[B.A.]
What? Are you kidding, sucker?

32:19.834 --> 32:22.408
[Hannibal] Better slow down
so we don"t attract attention.

32:22.504 --> 32:25.078
We gotta find someplace
to regroup.

32:25.174 --> 32:27.582
This isn't going down
very smooth, is it?

32:27.677 --> 32:30.548
lt"s not enough having the mob
and the cops looking for us.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.596
When Hannibal's photo
gets run for I. D...

32:32.682 --> 32:37.144
the computer's gonna spit it out
onto Colonel Lynch's desk, and
he's gonna trail smoke getting here.

32:37.229 --> 32:39.269
Cheer up, Face.

32:39.357 --> 32:43.854
Remember, it's always darkest
just before it goes totally black.

32:52.873 --> 32:56.324
Carmine and Mr DeSapio
are even coming out from New York.

32:56.418 --> 33:00.119
- Well, we'll try to have Vincent
and his gang before they get out here.
- You make sure you have them!

33:00.214 --> 33:02.788
I want those guys.
You spread the word.

33:02.884 --> 33:05.173
Open season on the slimes
that killed Gianni.

33:05.262 --> 33:07.932
One hundred grand
to whoever nails 'em.

33:14.022 --> 33:16.727
[Whooshing]

33:23.908 --> 33:26.826
They were real nice to me,
everyone in the casino.

33:26.912 --> 33:29.035
The more I won,
the more they would buy me drinks...

33:29.123 --> 33:31.531
and let me go to the shows
on the house and bring a guest.

33:31.626 --> 33:33.998
- Elly.
- Yeah, Elly.

33:34.087 --> 33:36.922
What a sweet girl.
She reminded me a lot of Sue Beth.

33:37.007 --> 33:39.047
Took real good care of me.

33:39.134 --> 33:41.590
I remember one night,
I was feeling a little giddy.

33:41.679 --> 33:44.087
And I hadn't had anything stronger
to drink than orange juice.

33:44.182 --> 33:47.017
Anyway, I remember Elly told me
to go upstairs and lie down.

33:47.102 --> 33:50.388
And I did. And the next thing
I remember...

33:50.481 --> 33:55.060
I woke up in this house somewhere,
and there were these two big guys,
and they wouldn't let me leave.

33:55.153 --> 33:57.525
- And they tried to get your system
out of you.
- No, not them.

33:57.614 --> 34:00.532
But this guy they would bring around.
They called him Mr M.

34:00.618 --> 34:04.201
- Martell.
- He would make me explain
my system to him.

34:04.288 --> 34:06.246
It's not a complicated procedure.

34:06.333 --> 34:10.460
If you understand the coefficients
of prime-based numbers
in random patterns...

34:10.545 --> 34:13.380
But l... I guess math
wasn't one of his interests.

34:13.466 --> 34:16.668
Did you try primary trigonometry
or logarithms...

34:16.761 --> 34:18.719
founded in remedial calculus?

34:18.804 --> 34:21.297
Yes, I did,
but he couldn't grasp it.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.891
Hmm. Oooh, watch out, Woody.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.138
They tried to do that to me.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.561
Sometimes he'd get really angry
and start yelling and screaming.

34:34.657 --> 34:36.899
I'd think he was gonna hit me.

34:36.993 --> 34:40.362
But then he'd calm down, and I'd try
to explain it to him further...

34:40.455 --> 34:42.862
but I don't think he understood
what I was saying.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.916
Probably what kept you alive.

34:45.002 --> 34:47.838
They were trying to figure out if you were
just a guy who thought he had a system...

34:47.922 --> 34:51.007
was running into a stroke of luck,
or if it actually worked.

34:51.092 --> 34:53.050
[Man On TV]
Here is a special news item break.

34:53.137 --> 34:56.138
Just handed to me
from the KJJV newsroom.

34:56.224 --> 35:00.602
Hey, Hannibal, don't we know
this guy from someplace?

35:00.687 --> 35:04.602
- [Hannibal] Oh, wonderful!
- Police officials believe
the suspects are still in this area.

35:04.692 --> 35:08.275
One interesting twist to this situation,
although it is strictly rumour...

35:08.363 --> 35:11.613
is Christian"s associates have offered
a $ 100,000 bounty...

35:11.700 --> 35:15.152
to anyone who can produce the missing
Tony Vincent or his accomplices.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.488
Local police advise
all would-be bounty hunters...

35:17.582 --> 35:20.120
not to take the offer seriously.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.783
Great. That was like
running an ad.

35:22.879 --> 35:25.632
With 100 G's reward out there,
every cab driver, hit man...

35:25.716 --> 35:29.002
or half a wise guy looking for a
quick score is gonna be gunning for us.

35:29.095 --> 35:32.630
That's... That's illegal!

35:32.724 --> 35:37.054
You can't place a bounty
on a human being's head
like... like this is the Wild West.

35:37.146 --> 35:39.637
- Sure you can.
- Who did kill Christian?

35:39.732 --> 35:42.687
Somebody who wanted
the opportunity.

35:42.777 --> 35:45.648
I was a perfect patsy,
walking in telling Mr Christian...

35:45.739 --> 35:48.943
I'd snuff out his lights
unless he snapped to.

35:49.035 --> 35:51.324
Somebody grabbed the chance
and chucked him out the window.

35:52.789 --> 35:56.159
You're right, Hannibal.
I hung by to keep an eye on the van.

35:56.251 --> 35:59.751
A couple pin-striped suits came along
and spotted it. Started checking it out.

35:59.839 --> 36:01.962
They didn"t seem
like cops to me.

36:02.050 --> 36:05.051
Well, I'm not worried about the cops.
We'll get by them.

36:05.137 --> 36:09.634
But with that reward out
and the whole syndicate on the streets...

36:09.725 --> 36:11.802
this town is covered
with a blanket.

36:11.894 --> 36:15.679
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- We stack the deck in our favour.

36:15.774 --> 36:19.060
- I got a plan.
- I hope this plan
is better than your last one.

36:19.153 --> 36:21.395
The last one worked.
We got Professor Warfel.

36:21.489 --> 36:24.858
But this one's gotta
get us out of town.

36:24.951 --> 36:27.822
- That's what I do best.
- Guess who.

36:27.913 --> 36:30.665
[Pecking On Wood]

36:30.750 --> 36:34.795
[Laughing]

36:46.768 --> 36:50.303
I couldn't believe it. When Gianni decided
to hand Warfel over, I begged him...

36:50.397 --> 36:53.731
"Gianni, don't trust this bum."

36:53.818 --> 36:55.811
Gianni... What can I say?

36:55.904 --> 36:58.656
He was becoming a little infirm.

36:58.740 --> 37:02.359
He let this guy back him down,
scare him.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.991
Scuzzball goes and kills him anyway.

37:05.081 --> 37:08.367
He was breaking.
He punked out.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.746
Maybe this guy Vincent
did us a good turn.

37:11.839 --> 37:15.255
Listen, Jackie, we all know
how much you meant to Gianni...

37:15.343 --> 37:17.252
and what he meant to you.

37:17.345 --> 37:19.718
I'd like you to know how right
we feel about it...

37:19.806 --> 37:24.019
is that you be considered to be in line
for a place on the committee,
and I speak for all of us.

37:24.103 --> 37:27.389
It's an honour. Of course,
I'll continue to run things around here...

37:27.482 --> 37:30.816
until the committee can come
to some sort of decision as to...

37:30.903 --> 37:34.687
how to cope with Mr Christian's
unexpected demise.

37:34.782 --> 37:37.238
Then naturally, if you want me to...

37:37.327 --> 37:41.539
I'll stay on
in whatever capacity.

37:41.623 --> 37:45.669
You're pretty quick to step
into Gianni's shoes, Jackie boy.

37:45.753 --> 37:48.624
I only do what's asked of me,
Mr DeSapio.

37:49.966 --> 37:52.422
- No, thank you.
- Thank you.

37:52.511 --> 37:55.762
- Oh, Pop. Pops.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I'll get a towel.

37:55.848 --> 37:58.684
- [Chuckles]
- And what about this Vincent?

37:58.768 --> 38:02.019
Now, we can't just let anybody
smack us openly like this.

38:02.105 --> 38:06.151
I told Gianni let me take care of him in
the first place. Now I put the word out.

38:06.235 --> 38:08.145
He knows he's got me
to tango with now.

38:08.237 --> 38:11.358
I'll bet you if he's not already dead,
he's all the way to Timbuktu.

38:11.449 --> 38:14.320
I missed the plane, Jackie boy.

38:14.411 --> 38:17.947
And the shooter said,
"Let it ride."

38:19.751 --> 38:22.159
Don't reach for anything
unless you wanna see...

38:22.254 --> 38:25.290
everybody's brains
all over the rug.

38:25.382 --> 38:28.918
I admit there probably
isn't enough of them to make a big mess...

38:29.011 --> 38:32.132
but please, don't move.

38:32.223 --> 38:34.845
It wouldn't look good
on the annual stockholders' report...

38:34.935 --> 38:38.020
to have three of its board
of directors die in one day.

38:38.105 --> 38:40.561
Give me those chopper keys.

38:43.236 --> 38:45.194
- Open it up.
- What?

38:48.951 --> 38:52.285
You'll never make it out of the hotel.
Mr Christian set up a security system.

38:52.372 --> 38:55.207
Nobody can get into that elevator
without the code.

38:56.418 --> 39:00.417
- We had an electronics expert
work on the fuse panel in the basement.
- Take him, Face.

39:00.506 --> 39:05.632
Now, anybody tries to stop us,
and smiley here comes back with
a couple ounces of lead in him.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.595
I'd spread that around town
real fast...

39:07.681 --> 39:09.888
in case some amateur hungry
for the reward tries something.

39:09.976 --> 39:13.760
We don't like to be followed.
Show him.

39:17.234 --> 39:19.690
- Go get 'em!
- There's a staircase
that goes to the roof!

39:21.656 --> 39:24.277
I thought you were going
up to the helicopter.

39:24.367 --> 39:29.030
I like helicopters. Do you like
helicopters? I love helicopters.

39:29.123 --> 39:31.080
You're never gonna make it
to the freeway.

39:31.167 --> 39:33.076
Come on, Jackie boy.

39:33.169 --> 39:38.045
They won't do anything to endanger the
life of their new capo di tutti-frutti...

39:38.133 --> 39:41.966
unless they find out you chucked
your buddy out of a 30-storey window...

39:42.054 --> 39:44.178
like yesterday's newspaper.

39:48.145 --> 39:51.229
They must be headed for the garage.
Come on!

39:51.315 --> 39:53.771
You had that planned all along,
didn't you?

39:53.860 --> 39:56.731
I was just
a convenient excuse, right?

39:56.821 --> 39:59.313
You made it so easy for me.

39:59.408 --> 40:03.572
Just as easy as it's gonna be
to take care of you when this is over.

40:03.663 --> 40:08.076
- So much for Amy's exclusive.
- I'll deny that. That's no good.

40:08.168 --> 40:13.127
Not in a court of law, but with
the boys upstairs... Come on, Jackie.

40:13.215 --> 40:16.501
You guys are dog meat.
[Chuckles]

40:22.476 --> 40:25.762
- Elevator's all set to go back up.
- What do you think of Christian's limo?

40:25.855 --> 40:30.150
[B.A.] She"s okay.
She"s got an inch of armour plating
and the glass is bulletproof.

40:30.235 --> 40:32.773
Murdock, here are the keys
to the chopper on the roof.

40:32.863 --> 40:36.363
- Take the professor on back to Arizona.
- I really haven't had a chance
to thank you.

40:36.451 --> 40:41.030
Send us a postcard, Professor.
Or better yet, send Darlene instead.

40:44.293 --> 40:47.247
- Okay, B.A., hit it.
- Go for the tyres!
It's an armour-plated car!

40:47.338 --> 40:49.415
[Gunshots]

41:25.799 --> 41:29.003
Better put some English on it, B.A.
We got some party crashers.

41:29.095 --> 41:32.796
Give me a break. With all this armour,
this thing corners like a semi.

41:32.891 --> 41:36.557
Well, take it easy.
Remember, black is beautiful.

41:36.645 --> 41:39.647
Not on you, it ain't.

42:21.322 --> 42:24.526
- [Helicopter Blades Whirring]
- That sounds like a chopper.

42:59.533 --> 43:03.116
- Looks like the cavalry is here.
- [Hannibal] Do it to "em.

43:03.204 --> 43:05.161
Look out!

43:09.211 --> 43:11.963
- Now where'd he get this?
- I don't know. Maybe they got some more.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.084
Well, well, well.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.637
- An Ingram with an extra clip.
- Do you believe these guys?

43:19.723 --> 43:22.927
[Chuckles]
Open the roof, Face.

43:24.729 --> 43:28.893
Now, if that guy comes to,
give him a concussion, huh?

43:28.984 --> 43:30.858
Right.

43:40.872 --> 43:43.245
Give me another clip.

44:13.702 --> 44:18.032
- [Man] Man! Hey, Cliff, you okay?
- Yeah, l"m okay.

44:21.419 --> 44:23.293
[Sighs]

44:26.258 --> 44:28.168
Oh, thanks.

44:28.260 --> 44:30.300
Boy.

44:30.388 --> 44:33.555
Hannibal loves thejazz.

44:33.642 --> 44:37.806
[Woody Woodpecker Laughing]

44:42.944 --> 44:45.780
Hey, guys.
Notice who got the banner?

44:45.864 --> 44:47.904
- Come on, kid. We'll buy you lunch.
- Oh.

44:47.992 --> 44:51.527
Four of Martell's buddies
helped break him loose when they were
transporting him back to Nevada.

44:51.621 --> 44:54.373
I don't think they broke him loose
because they're his buddies.

44:54.457 --> 44:57.031
You don't? They helped him
escape to kill him?

44:57.127 --> 45:00.045
Well, if they read the note I left,
which they would have by now...

45:00.131 --> 45:03.666
Mr Jack Martell is probably
part of the foundation...

45:03.760 --> 45:06.085
of one of the new high-rises
on the strip.

45:06.179 --> 45:10.260
The cops will find out he killed Gianni,
which means that nobody's chasing us...

45:10.351 --> 45:12.308
except Lynch.

45:12.395 --> 45:14.720
Okay, why are you guys
really here?

45:14.814 --> 45:18.433
- I got worried when you called
and said you were coming by.
- Have you seen Murdock?

45:18.527 --> 45:21.813
- Isn't he at the hospital?
- Nope. We haven't heard
from him since Vegas.

45:21.906 --> 45:25.655
- You're kidding? I hope he's okay.
- Mama, he ain't been okay his whole life.

45:25.744 --> 45:29.576
Well, I did talk to Sue Beth
and Darlene, and they said
Professor Warfel got home safely.

45:29.665 --> 45:32.239
So that means Murdock made it
as far as Arizona.

45:32.335 --> 45:34.624
I'm gonna quit worrying
about Murdock.

45:34.712 --> 45:37.286
He's probably just trying
to thumb a ride.

45:42.555 --> 45:46.470
[Plane Engines Droning]

45:51.148 --> 45:52.892
Jerk!

45:52.983 --> 45:55.522
[Man]
Tucson Tower, this is Trans Global 39.

45:55.611 --> 45:58.946
We"ve got a civilian down on runway 21.
Looks like he"s hitchhiking.
