00:49.413 --> 00:52.651
I am filing a grievance
with the union on this.

00:52.751 --> 00:54.288
Yeah.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.474
I mean, double overtime on labor day?

00:58.958 --> 01:01.010
View ain't too shabby though?

01:05.998 --> 01:09.069
Sure, but I'd still rather
spend time with the fam.

01:09.869 --> 01:12.039
<i>You gentlemen do realize
sequential cooling units...</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:14.757
<i>...are incapable of replacing themselves.</i>

01:14.857 --> 01:18.877
Sorry, Kate.
I am examining the connectors now.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.700
<i>Check orientation to payload bay.</i>

01:26.452 --> 01:28.538
Beginning installation. Stand by.

01:52.211 --> 01:56.240
<i>It's another beautiful day
in sunny Southern California.</i>

01:57.350 --> 02:00.467
<i>Nothing but clear,
blue skies in the forecast.</i>

02:01.937 --> 02:04.359
<i>So get that party started.</i>

02:05.325 --> 02:08.148
<i>Let's make this a labor day
weekend to remember.</i>

02:08.828 --> 02:11.532
<i>So keep it tuned right here
as I keep on spinning today's hottest...</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:14.668
Look, I'm telling you, man,
this girl's gorgeous.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.575
I'm just not in the mood, all right?

02:17.675 --> 02:20.273
It's been over a year now.
You've been in that cage long enough.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.809
We'll drink some beers,
have some laughs, get laid.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.312
By the end of this weekend
you're gonna be a whole new you.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.830
Charlie 2.0

02:36.956 --> 02:38.768
I'm so ready.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.024
I need a vacation.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.530
- Need a lift?
- I don't know.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.903
I heard hitchhiking can be dangerous.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.839
Okay.

03:11.657 --> 03:14.161
Hey, Char.
I'd like to introduce you to Annie.

03:14.261 --> 03:17.931
- Hi, Charlie. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.721
Oh, and, dude drooling back there,
he answers to Brendan.

03:22.302 --> 03:26.147
- All right, let's get 'em in there, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, sorry, on my phone.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.876
Do you want me to put your bag in the back?

03:28.976 --> 03:32.027
Oh, yeah, thank you. Thanks.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.629
Oh, my God, you guys...

03:52.729 --> 03:55.635
...it looks like the lake's gonna be
over 80 degrees all weekend.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.324
- Yes!
- I can't wait to jump in!

03:58.424 --> 04:00.367
- Oh, my God!
- It's so gonna happen.

04:01.707 --> 04:04.391
- My brother said we can use his jet ski.
- No.

04:04.491 --> 04:08.163
- We're not jet skiing. Jet skiing's for tools.
- Oh, shut up.

04:32.665 --> 04:34.946
Thank God.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.153
You think this dump has a restroom?

04:46.353 --> 04:48.637
Come on, find a bush.

04:54.593 --> 04:56.445
For the gas.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.871
- Want one?
- Yes, I do.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.569
Should I?

05:13.479 --> 05:14.781
Hey.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.684
- Sorry, the music.
- That's okay.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.153
Thanks.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.346
So...

05:22.983 --> 05:24.811
...you always such a chatterbox?

05:26.825 --> 05:28.456
Yeah.

05:28.556 --> 05:32.070
Sorry, I just have a lot on my mind.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.137
Well, do you wanna talk about it or...

05:38.237 --> 05:39.273
- No.
- Okay.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.108
- Sorry, just...
- No, it's fine.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.669
Not right now.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.445
Yeah, okay.

05:45.745 --> 05:50.031
I'll let you get back to your...
wallowing, or whatever.

06:39.030 --> 06:42.475
- You in the wrong place.
- No, no, no! I didn't see anything, I swear!

06:42.575 --> 06:45.638
- Yeah, but you gonna.
- Help!

06:45.738 --> 06:47.906
Keep yapping, see what happen.

06:50.442 --> 06:54.113
Goddamn reporters.
Ain't you taken enough already?

06:54.213 --> 06:57.417
You don't understand.
We just actually stopped for gas.

06:58.517 --> 07:03.757
Just filling up? Old Sunday drive, route 66.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.059
You seem damn interested in my handiwork.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.161
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:08.261 --> 07:10.330
- I think we oughta take a look.
- No, please.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.782
- Sure you do. Surely, come on.
- No!

07:15.167 --> 07:17.911
This here's Bambi. Dead Bambi.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.043
Say hello, Bambi.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.259
What's going on, Brendan?
You trying to pass a kidney stone?

07:24.877 --> 07:27.095
Bren, what's going on, man?

07:29.381 --> 07:32.251
Look, I think this is just
a big misunderstanding, okay?

07:32.351 --> 07:34.620
Bren, we should go. Now.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.124
Yeah, Brendan, you should leave.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.242
Get.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.802
Yo, have a nice day.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.873
Oh, shit, he's got a gun.
Get in the car, now.

07:51.973 --> 07:54.053
- Get in the car. Get in the car.
- What's going on?

07:54.153 --> 07:55.408
Just get in!

07:55.508 --> 07:58.526
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

08:09.387 --> 08:13.190
Yeah, you should've knocked him on his
butt, dude. That's what I would've done.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.967
Dude, this hillbilly was, like, crazy strong.

08:18.397 --> 08:22.650
His hands, he had, like,
kung fu action grip or something.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.574
Elizabeth.

09:15.954 --> 09:17.806
We're here.

09:24.896 --> 09:26.733
Babe, this is going to be incredible.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.917
All right, guys, get your bags.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.988
Well, this is gonna be fun.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.192
Sick!

09:39.711 --> 09:42.164
- What you think, man?
- Yeah.

09:50.956 --> 09:52.841
This way.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.063
Your parents really know
how to live it up, don't they?

10:00.163 --> 10:01.334
They do okay.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.971
Hey, I need to set up
my equipment before it gets dark.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.173
Okay, yeah. Annie knows the way to the lake.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.676
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.711
You guys coming?

10:12.525 --> 10:14.547
We have to...

10:14.847 --> 10:16.865
Prep the bedrooms?

10:17.916 --> 10:19.168
Yeah.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.703
Nice. Follow me.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.343
Have fun with that.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.220
Oh, what does that do?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.040
It's a motion sensor.

10:59.891 --> 11:03.529
This thing has a 40 foot flash radius...

11:03.629 --> 11:06.813
...so it can catch any nighttime visitors.

11:06.913 --> 11:09.368
- Any what?
- Bigfoot.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.989
Bears, actually.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.854
So who is she?

11:43.301 --> 11:45.783
The girl on your phone.

11:48.273 --> 11:50.743
I'd rather just not talk about it,
if that's all right.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.728
Yeah, okay.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.701
Breathtaking, isn't it?

12:01.119 --> 12:02.468
Absolutely.

12:04.923 --> 12:07.274
Kara and I used to stand here...

12:07.374 --> 12:11.519
...and close our eyes,
and let go of every worry...

12:11.619 --> 12:13.481
...every fear.

12:16.968 --> 12:18.601
Try.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.571
Over here, hurry up!

12:53.772 --> 12:55.824
Oh, hell, yeah.

13:00.912 --> 13:02.764
Come on.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.277
Y'all watch crime dramas?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.761
'Cause this is pretty much
always where they find the body.

13:18.497 --> 13:19.999
Relax.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.229
It's abandoned.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.835
Kara and I used to love
exploring this place as kids.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.125
I don't think this is so abandoned.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.632
I guess a quick peak wouldn't hurt.

14:03.041 --> 14:07.654
This is a 9.3 Ghz Doppler radar, man.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.266
Still works.

14:18.256 --> 14:21.916
You guys. This is military radio.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.284
Are you okay?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.324
Here, sit down, sit down.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.559
Annie, what do you need?
Just tell me what you need.

14:45.751 --> 14:48.220
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.289
Oh, trust me, that was nothing.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.225
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.927
- Seemed pretty intense to me.
- No, it's all...

14:55.904 --> 14:57.712
...it's all good.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.605
Guys, it's the crazy dude
from the gas station.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.741
- What?
- What?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.623
Holy crap, it's actually him.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.895
Oh, no.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.252
Shit! Come on, let's go.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.360
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:33.364 --> 15:35.583
Let me try. Let me try.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.921
Oh, my God.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.199
What's going on?

16:43.634 --> 16:45.506
Go, go, go!

16:47.605 --> 16:49.657
Here he comes!

16:53.078 --> 16:54.962
Go, go, go!

16:55.800 --> 16:58.434
- Come on, hurry up. Here he comes. Go!
- Run! Run!

17:12.262 --> 17:16.751
You okay? Hey, you okay?
Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on.

17:34.285 --> 17:37.264
<i>Meteorologists are debating
the cause of the spiraling clouds...</i>

17:37.364 --> 17:39.688
<i>...first observed over the entire peninsula.</i>

17:39.788 --> 17:42.662
<i>Is this further proof of global warming?</i>

17:43.162 --> 17:45.579
- Wait, wait!
- <i>That's what people...</i>

17:45.689 --> 17:49.369
<i>...across the country have been asking
since those mysterious cloud formations...</i>

17:49.469 --> 17:51.640
<i>...appeared in the sky earlier this morning.</i>

17:51.840 --> 17:55.916
<i>As camera phones around the world capture
startling images of this bizarre phenomena...</i>

17:56.016 --> 17:58.924
<i>...the weather forecast seems
to be shifting by the minute.</i>

17:59.024 --> 18:02.410
<i>Let's turn now to chief meteorologist,
Paula Tally, for some more insight...</i>

18:02.510 --> 18:04.784
<i>...into what could conceivably cause...</i>

18:04.884 --> 18:07.985
Guys, guys! You'll never believe...

18:08.085 --> 18:09.568
- Look.
- <i>Yeah, Donald...</i>

18:09.668 --> 18:13.175
<i>...an event of these proportions is
definitely something we haven't seen before.</i>

18:13.525 --> 18:16.862
<i>But what's really shocking
is just how rapidly it's expanding...</i>

18:16.962 --> 18:19.098
Hey, what the hell is that?

18:19.198 --> 18:20.997
Don't ask me.

18:21.097 --> 18:23.381
- I'm gonna go get another beer.
- <i>Not surprisingly...</i>

18:23.481 --> 18:26.686
<i>...many are already calling this
the storm of the century.</i>

18:28.640 --> 18:32.431
<i>Okay, Paula, we've got new reports coming in
from China, Brazil, and Eastern Europe...</i>

18:32.531 --> 18:36.549
- It's everywhere.
- Well, everywhere but here, thank God.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.701
Hey, guys.

18:45.657 --> 18:49.461
Pretty incredible?
Why you think it's happening?

18:49.561 --> 18:54.033
You heard what they said,
some type of meteorological shift.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.969
<i>Have you been watching the news?</i>

18:57.069 --> 19:00.072
Global warming, Mom. I love you, Mom.

19:00.972 --> 19:02.824
Hey, guys.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.660
'Sup?

19:06.644 --> 19:10.032
The battery's dead.
Someone left the lights on.

19:12.049 --> 19:13.853
Don't look at me.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.404
We'll have to charge it overnight, all right?

19:17.322 --> 19:20.353
- I love you.
- <i>I love you, too, sweetheart.</i>

19:20.453 --> 19:22.092
<i>Be safe.</i>

19:22.192 --> 19:23.779
Bye.

19:31.769 --> 19:33.021
Smile.

19:45.516 --> 19:47.820
Some of you will recognize these photos...

19:47.920 --> 19:52.125
...from the Conden committee's
investigation into Project Blue Book.

19:52.225 --> 19:56.575
The committee's findings effectively
ended the project in 1969...

19:56.675 --> 20:01.237
...but pilots continue to report
strikingly similar experiences...

20:01.485 --> 20:03.662
...in the decades since.

20:08.766 --> 20:10.708
Bring him in.

20:38.469 --> 20:43.079
So, about that old story
of yours, Mr. Romanovich.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.529
The one you never wanted to hear.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.999
Well, we're all ears now.

21:07.832 --> 21:10.068
The hood's been forced, Char.

21:10.568 --> 21:13.472
- What?
- I found this...

21:13.572 --> 21:16.572
...wedged between the positive
terminal and the frame.

21:16.672 --> 21:18.760
Shorted out the battery.

21:20.945 --> 21:25.351
I think I know who it was. Yeah, dude.
Earlier we found this abandoned cabin.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.301
It wasn't so abandoned.
It belongs to that weirdo...

21:29.401 --> 21:32.624
...the guy who was screwing
with Brendan at the station.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.660
Now he's screwing with all of us.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.718
Okay, don't mention anything
about this to the girls, yeah?

21:37.818 --> 21:40.648
We're not letting some clown
ruin our vacation.

22:15.107 --> 22:19.563
<i>It's confirmed. The visitors are still
on track to arrive in your area.</i>

22:21.539 --> 22:23.925
You can't fight them, Colonel.

22:25.910 --> 22:29.316
You can only make preparations...

22:30.416 --> 22:32.500
...for the aftermath.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.492
What's he doing?

22:58.142 --> 23:00.161
Yeah, yeah.

23:06.717 --> 23:09.589
So, should we give you guys some privacy?

23:11.089 --> 23:12.965
How 'bout we shoot some pool?

23:14.499 --> 23:17.596
I think I'm actually just gonna
turn in for the night, guys.

23:18.096 --> 23:21.678
Now that sounds like a great idea.
Doesn't it, babe?

23:37.516 --> 23:39.100
Bye.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.696
She looks like a nice girl.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.581
Yeah.

23:55.466 --> 23:57.502
Well, then why'd you break up?

23:58.504 --> 24:00.072
We didn't break up.

24:01.672 --> 24:04.877
I knew it. You're such an asshole.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.302
- Think I'm just some piece of...
- She died.

24:10.147 --> 24:12.816
- What?
- Yeah...

24:13.916 --> 24:17.358
...10 months ago. In a car accident.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.192
- I'm sorry, I...
- I had...

24:20.292 --> 24:22.628
- No, I thought Rob said something.
- I had no idea.

24:22.728 --> 24:26.199
- Seriously, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.873
It's okay.

24:49.053 --> 24:52.076
<i>One of the most controversial bloggers
in the country is warning us...</i>

24:52.176 --> 24:56.528
<i>...about the extraterrestrial nature
of those unusual cloud formations.</i>

24:56.628 --> 25:02.354
<i>Yes, what we are looking at here is the
arrival of an extraterrestrial civilization.</i>

25:02.454 --> 25:06.472
<i>I have been saying this on television,
on my website, for 20 years.</i>

25:06.572 --> 25:09.711
<i>This phenomena that we're seeing
in the sky cannot be disputed.</i>

25:09.811 --> 25:13.315
<i>The government is not telling us
what's going on. It's an outrage.</i>

25:13.415 --> 25:15.981
<i>It's been almost four hours, for God's sake!</i>

25:16.181 --> 25:19.751
<i>Let's go ahead and welcome our
next guest, Dr. Lawrence Manning.</i>

25:19.851 --> 25:21.420
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:25.620
<i>Doctor, you're claiming to have experienced
direct contact with the visitors...</i>

25:25.720 --> 25:27.359
<i>...as you refer to them.</i>

25:27.459 --> 25:31.330
<i>In March of '68, I, myself, was taken.</i>

25:32.630 --> 25:36.568
<i>I awoke on a surgical table of some kind.</i>

25:37.268 --> 25:39.734
<i>They did things to my body.</i>

25:40.292 --> 25:43.953
<i>I cannot tell you
the pain that I went through.</i>

25:46.207 --> 25:51.095
<i>Within the last few minutes, what appears
to be a massive craft has started emerging.</i>

26:08.598 --> 26:12.163
- What was that?
- It's probably just the storm.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.761
They know I'm here.

27:09.861 --> 27:12.380
You'll be perfectly safe in this facility.

27:14.965 --> 27:17.590
It's not me I'm worried about.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.038
Kara?

27:48.799 --> 27:50.198
What's wrong, baby?

28:00.477 --> 28:02.696
You okay? What's wrong?

28:06.751 --> 28:08.287
Kara?

28:09.187 --> 28:11.472
Hey, guys, please, come here!

28:13.440 --> 28:15.092
Baby!

28:16.494 --> 28:18.180
- What's wrong with her?
- I have no idea.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.362
She was standing by the window
and just passed out.

28:20.462 --> 28:22.534
Kara! Kara!

28:23.334 --> 28:24.903
Hey.

28:25.453 --> 28:29.054
- What the hell happened?
- I'm okay. I'm fine.

28:49.026 --> 28:50.694
- Guys!
- You scared me, baby.

28:50.794 --> 28:54.166
- I'm good, I'm...
- Guys, guys, you're gonna wanna see...

28:54.266 --> 28:56.068
- What's wrong with her?
- I'm fine.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.337
- She blacked out for a minute.
- A minute?

28:59.437 --> 29:01.973
Guys, guys, you have to see this, come on.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.078
No, come on!

29:04.711 --> 29:06.571
Come on.

29:12.316 --> 29:16.758
You finally got the photo of the grizzly,
man. Congratulations.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.513
That's not a bear.

29:19.613 --> 29:21.480
Then what is it?

29:29.633 --> 29:31.845
I knew that dirt bag was behind this.

29:31.945 --> 29:35.107
- Thanks to you, Brendan.
- Guys, knock it off.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.313
Baby, relax. I got a gun in the car, a .38.

29:38.413 --> 29:40.480
You brought a gun?

29:43.497 --> 29:45.767
Wait, hey, hey, Rob. Rob, what are you doing?

29:45.867 --> 29:47.668
I'm getting my gun.

30:09.673 --> 30:12.240
- Let's call my mom.
- Yeah.

30:15.279 --> 30:17.716
Damn. No signal.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.869
The storm probably knocked out
the communication relays.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.182
Guys, whoa, what's going on?

30:45.282 --> 30:47.361
Shit. Rob.

30:53.884 --> 30:55.887
Let me in! Open the door!

30:55.987 --> 30:58.757
It's Rob. It's Rob. Let him in.
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.664
Hey, over here.

31:04.345 --> 31:06.159
What happened?

31:08.232 --> 31:10.669
I tripped and the gun went off.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.171
- Rob, what the hell did you see?
- Baby, tell us...

31:13.271 --> 31:15.890
Look, I don't know what it was, okay?

31:19.410 --> 31:22.413
Slow down, okay, Rob?
You're scaring the shit out of everybody.

31:22.513 --> 31:25.331
I'm okay. I'm okay.

31:26.851 --> 31:28.380
No, Kara.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.207
Just... no.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.859
Get away from the window. Now.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.795
It's out there.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.447
- The red glow.
- Oh, my God.

31:42.032 --> 31:45.819
Now I remember what happened to me.
It came down from the cloud.

31:46.359 --> 31:47.728
Oh, shit!

31:53.944 --> 31:55.396
Is everybody okay?

31:59.549 --> 32:01.752
The battery's gotta be charged by now, right?

32:01.852 --> 32:03.856
I say we get in the car
and head to the closest town.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.758
- Yeah.
- Dude, that's a two-hour drive.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.004
What about the hunter's cabin?

32:09.104 --> 32:12.763
The radio. We can call for help
on the emergency frequency.

32:12.863 --> 32:16.755
We take this dirt road and keep our
headlights off, we'll be there in 5 minutes.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.338
Why do I have the feeling
you're gonna get us all killed, Char?

32:20.438 --> 32:23.108
Something you wanna say, man? Just say it.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.410
Hey!

32:25.610 --> 32:30.648
Wanna finish this fucking pissing
contest some other time? Seriously.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.978
She's right. We all just gotta calm...

32:33.078 --> 32:34.152
Hey!

32:34.252 --> 32:36.721
Seriously? Did you just point
the fucking gun at me?

32:36.821 --> 32:39.157
I'd hardly need a gun
to take care of you, Char.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.829
- Is that right?
- Yep.

32:41.929 --> 32:45.275
You're a pussy, Char. You're the last
person who should be calling the shots...

32:45.375 --> 32:47.098
...when lives are at stake.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.518
You son of a bitch, I know exactly
what you're implying. Say it!

32:50.618 --> 32:52.529
Guys, I don't feel so good.

32:52.837 --> 32:56.690
Get off me! Hey, hey.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.878
We're all gonna die.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.063
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, you understand?

33:21.164 --> 33:24.502
Hey. Hey. We have to go now, okay?

33:24.602 --> 33:28.088
Doesn't matter.
They're taking us no matter what.

33:46.557 --> 33:49.169
Some kind of... some kind of drone?

34:07.778 --> 34:09.831
What the hell are we gonna do?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.551
You two, head to the garage
and unplug the car battery.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.387
Char and I will meet you there
in five minutes, okay?

34:16.487 --> 34:17.989
Go!

34:18.489 --> 34:20.574
Come on, I need your help with Kara.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.911
Go. Go. Go.

34:45.998 --> 34:48.402
What the... where did she go?

34:52.656 --> 34:54.507
It's inside.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.490
Hey, not yet.

35:34.865 --> 35:36.668
What have I done?

35:37.456 --> 35:39.286
I'm sorry.

35:40.104 --> 35:42.923
Rob? Go, go.

35:47.877 --> 35:50.897
Head up to the garage.
Get in the garage, now.

35:57.454 --> 35:59.272
Come on.

35:59.990 --> 36:04.362
- What happened to her?
- I don't know. I didn't know it was her.

36:04.462 --> 36:07.562
- What did you do?
- We're gonna get you out of here, baby.

36:07.662 --> 36:09.666
I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay?

36:11.768 --> 36:14.205
No, no, no, no, no.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.791
No, no, no, don't do this to me. Breathe.

36:18.363 --> 36:21.199
Breathe, baby. Breathe, breathe, okay?

36:21.899 --> 36:24.931
Breathe, baby, please, breathe.

36:25.862 --> 36:29.724
- Rob, just... Rob.
- Get off me! Breathe, damn it!

36:29.824 --> 36:33.525
- She's dead. Leave her. Move.
- No, no, no.

36:33.825 --> 36:38.062
She's gone, okay? Hey, Rob,
there's nothing we can do, okay?

36:38.162 --> 36:41.565
We gotta go. We gotta go, okay?
We gotta go to the car.

36:45.336 --> 36:48.555
- I don't see anything.
- Yeah, I know. That worries me.

36:53.177 --> 36:56.247
We have no idea what they're
capable of or what they are.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.867
We need a distraction, fellas.

37:02.027 --> 37:05.105
What the hell are... Rob,
what the fuck are you doing, man?

37:05.923 --> 37:07.574
Run to the forest.

37:09.726 --> 37:11.997
- I said, run to the fucking forest!
- Stop!

37:12.097 --> 37:15.910
Rob, calm... calm down. Calm down.

37:48.965 --> 37:50.702
We have to go.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.337
Charlie.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.596
- Rob!
- Charlie. We have to go now, damn it.

37:55.696 --> 37:57.508
We have to go.

37:58.308 --> 38:00.594
Come on. Charlie.

38:04.781 --> 38:06.666
Good, go!

38:17.093 --> 38:19.179
Go! Go!

38:28.888 --> 38:30.547
Shit.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.377
Where you going, buddy?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.203
Leaving me for dead?

39:15.788 --> 39:18.251
Rob. Rob!

39:24.461 --> 39:26.680
Run, run!

39:37.723 --> 39:39.259
Annie.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.307
- I need a moment.
- We don't have a moment.

39:42.407 --> 39:44.866
We gotta go. We gotta go, okay?

39:51.420 --> 39:53.895
What? What... what is it?

39:53.995 --> 39:55.803
You're freaking me out.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.930
Right there, on top of that.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.234
- Oh, my God, it's... it's a hand.
- It's probably just a dead piece of bark.

40:02.334 --> 40:04.386
Just stay there, okay? You'll be fine.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.155
- Oh, my God.
- Do you see anything?

40:59.874 --> 41:03.342
Okay. Okay. Let's look at it.

41:05.929 --> 41:07.747
Oh, no.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.570
What's the prognosis, doctor?

41:13.670 --> 41:15.257
Well...

41:16.169 --> 41:17.917
- ...you'll survive.
- Yeah?

41:18.017 --> 41:19.359
Yeah.

41:26.616 --> 41:28.453
You know a lot about cuts?

41:29.953 --> 41:31.505
Maybe.

41:40.363 --> 41:42.216
What're you thinking about?

41:44.734 --> 41:46.322
Well...

41:47.404 --> 41:49.209
...let's see.

41:49.509 --> 41:51.518
My best friend's dead.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.418
And Rob.

41:53.518 --> 41:57.949
Rob just got fricking sucked into the sky,
so that's pretty much what's on my mind.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.418
I know.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.038
I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:06.756 --> 42:08.335
Just...

42:08.774 --> 42:11.581
...just keep it pressed
against the cut, okay?

42:12.180 --> 42:13.747
Yeah.

42:20.971 --> 42:24.224
Charlie! Annie!

42:33.682 --> 42:35.267
Charlie!

42:37.623 --> 42:39.190
- Oh, my God!
- It's a bear trap.

42:39.290 --> 42:43.121
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
- Okay? We gotta take it off, all right?

42:43.221 --> 42:45.330
No! No!

42:45.430 --> 42:46.965
Brendan!

42:47.265 --> 42:51.001
I'm gonna call for help.
I'm gonna call for help, okay?

42:51.201 --> 42:53.038
I'm gonna take it off.
I'm gonna take it off, okay?

42:53.138 --> 42:54.653
No!

42:58.474 --> 43:00.594
It's stuck. It's stuck, okay?

43:05.082 --> 43:08.168
Oh, my God. Okay.

43:09.753 --> 43:12.256
Okay. How does this work?

43:13.156 --> 43:14.808
Shoot.

43:21.665 --> 43:23.283
Stay here, okay?

43:47.591 --> 43:50.444
Careful. Might get a splinter.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.332
Plus mine's bigger.

43:54.732 --> 43:58.543
- What do you want?
- My trap back for starters.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.572
No.

44:03.273 --> 44:05.076
Nice to see you too.

44:05.176 --> 44:06.678
Stop!

44:08.178 --> 44:12.185
Stop your whining. Need some
cheese with all that damn wine.

44:13.650 --> 44:16.854
This is an emergency. Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

44:16.954 --> 44:19.257
<i>This is the U.S. Military.
Where are you located?</i>

44:19.357 --> 44:22.659
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God, yes.

44:22.759 --> 44:25.802
We're up... we're up near...

44:25.902 --> 44:29.133
...Trinity Lake.
Those things are trying to kill us.

44:29.233 --> 44:33.741
<i>Okay, listen. Please calm down.
Where exactly in relation to Trinity are you?</i>

44:35.093 --> 44:39.176
East of Rich... Richfield Road.

44:39.276 --> 44:42.413
Please, you've gotta hurry. Please.

44:42.513 --> 44:46.083
<i>I understand.
Reading dense vegetation at your locale.</i>

44:46.183 --> 44:48.419
<i>Can you make it to Garrity Gulch?</i>

44:49.219 --> 44:52.222
Yeah. Yeah, I think so, yes.

44:53.422 --> 44:56.828
<i>Copy that. The extraction team will
meet you there just as soon as possible.</i>

44:56.928 --> 44:59.446
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

45:10.674 --> 45:13.378
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

45:13.578 --> 45:17.630
You got lucky. Artery along the tibia's fine.

45:20.183 --> 45:22.068
Oh, my God, guys!

45:24.454 --> 45:27.492
There's one inside. In the cabin.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.194
Just one?

45:30.294 --> 45:31.978
Yeah.

45:33.246 --> 45:35.083
I can't move.

45:36.033 --> 45:37.835
Come on, sissy boy.

45:38.499 --> 45:39.971
No! No!

45:40.071 --> 45:43.122
- Time to dance.
- Where the hell you taking him?

45:48.144 --> 45:49.820
Follow me.

45:52.302 --> 45:54.178
Where we going?

46:05.662 --> 46:07.541
Stop whining.

46:26.316 --> 46:28.185
Where the hell are you going?

46:29.185 --> 46:31.155
What is he doing?

46:31.255 --> 46:33.057
Help's on the way.

46:33.657 --> 46:37.064
- What?
- I got through, on the radio.

46:38.094 --> 46:39.930
Thank God.

46:41.230 --> 46:44.200
We need to meet them at the lake, okay?

46:44.300 --> 46:46.765
Okay. Okay.

46:50.406 --> 46:53.019
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know.

47:23.438 --> 47:24.990
Gotcha!

47:26.777 --> 47:29.180
Yeah. Yeah.

47:30.780 --> 47:33.833
Welcome back. Remember me?

47:35.665 --> 47:38.389
What a bad host I am. I'm sorry.

47:38.489 --> 47:41.592
Maybe you'd like something...
something to drink.

47:41.692 --> 47:45.029
You look a little thirsty.
Or maybe something to eat?

47:45.129 --> 47:49.182
Here, you want something to eat?
I got the perfect thing for you.

48:02.045 --> 48:03.715
Motherfucker.

48:04.315 --> 48:07.718
What the hell? You used us as bait?

48:08.218 --> 48:10.020
You piece of shit.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.562
What? This funny to you?

48:17.261 --> 48:20.298
You guys, I can't feel my leg.

48:21.698 --> 48:24.317
You'll live, sissy boy.

48:37.263 --> 48:38.765
This is gonna pinch.

48:40.116 --> 48:41.935
Is he gonna be okay?

48:52.728 --> 48:54.814
That was the easy part.

49:07.443 --> 49:09.646
How did I get here?

49:10.146 --> 49:12.165
He carried you.

49:18.588 --> 49:20.858
- Drink this.
- What is it?

49:20.958 --> 49:22.809
You don't wanna know.

49:30.284 --> 49:32.838
- Tastes...
- Bite.

49:42.778 --> 49:44.300
This is gonna hurt.

49:45.781 --> 49:46.980
Okay.

49:48.684 --> 49:50.254
On three.

49:50.354 --> 49:52.888
One... two...

49:55.269 --> 49:56.810
...three.

50:15.744 --> 50:17.563
You ready?

50:19.448 --> 50:21.285
Bren needs more time. We can't just drag him.

50:21.385 --> 50:26.072
We'll drive. You get the keys,
and we'll take the truck.

50:27.490 --> 50:30.310
- Okay.
- I'll distract him.

50:32.495 --> 50:34.040
Okay.

50:46.676 --> 50:48.913
So your work, it's...

50:49.313 --> 50:52.349
I mean, it's pretty impressive, right?

50:53.549 --> 50:56.953
Wait till you see what I got planned
for our little friend from out of town.

51:00.139 --> 51:02.041
Won't work.

51:02.625 --> 51:05.095
- Excuse me?
- What?

51:05.195 --> 51:07.031
The truck.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.765
Won't work.

51:08.865 --> 51:11.101
Head gasket blew already.

51:11.401 --> 51:14.038
Barely made it home this afternoon, myself.

51:14.138 --> 51:17.024
- Oh, my God.
- You can take the boat though.

51:20.842 --> 51:22.661
We'll take it.

51:23.814 --> 51:25.569
What's so funny?

51:26.450 --> 51:29.654
I didn't mean now. In the dawn.

51:30.154 --> 51:33.190
Maybe even have a ghost
of a chance of making it.

51:33.730 --> 51:38.944
Sunlight seems to interfere
with their metabolism.

51:39.863 --> 51:41.698
Slows 'em down.

51:42.098 --> 51:43.821
Dawn?

51:43.921 --> 51:47.474
You actually expect us to sit
around here until dawn? Doing what?

51:47.804 --> 51:50.527
You'd be lucky to make it
50 yards out that door, son.

51:50.627 --> 51:53.657
What makes you such an expert
on these things anyways?

51:58.548 --> 52:02.020
- Seventh of April... 1995.
- Here we go.

52:02.120 --> 52:05.656
Sitting in the shuttle flight deck
doing prelaunch checks.

52:05.756 --> 52:08.859
I blinked, to wake up and find myself...

52:08.959 --> 52:12.530
...face down in a deserted land
2,000 miles away.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.703
<i>It was 48 hours later.</i>

52:15.803 --> 52:18.068
<i>No memory of where I'd been.</i>

52:18.168 --> 52:21.262
<i>No memory of how the hell
I get in the goddamn desert.</i>

52:21.938 --> 52:24.608
Then after a while,
things started coming back.

52:24.708 --> 52:27.844
Little things. Lights.

52:27.944 --> 52:29.247
Sounds.

52:30.247 --> 52:31.753
Smells.

52:32.723 --> 52:34.068
Tastes.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.637
Sounds like you had a hell of a trip?

52:41.625 --> 52:43.676
Yeah, we did.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.613
Yes, we did.

52:48.664 --> 52:50.550
Captain Romanovich and me.

52:54.270 --> 52:56.716
Forgot to show you my souvenirs.

53:00.644 --> 53:02.195
Yeah.

53:02.729 --> 53:04.564
And this one.

53:07.116 --> 53:09.386
This is how they mark the generals.

53:09.736 --> 53:11.078
Generals?

53:11.788 --> 53:14.825
The ones that show promise
before the adjustments.

53:14.925 --> 53:17.161
Just before the upgrades, you know.

53:17.261 --> 53:20.864
So you have a little something extra.

53:22.431 --> 53:26.452
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Preparing for the coming storm.

53:28.604 --> 53:31.842
For the last 60 years
they been conducting test runs.

53:31.942 --> 53:34.678
Take one, two, at a time.

53:34.778 --> 53:37.614
All in preparation for tonight.

53:38.064 --> 53:40.967
Tonight's mass abduction.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.572
I don't believe you.

54:01.537 --> 54:03.556
What the hell are you?

54:04.040 --> 54:05.876
Not really sure.

54:05.976 --> 54:08.374
Only discovered it a couple of years ago.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.283
'Fore long everything started to come back.

54:13.383 --> 54:15.990
Everything, and more.

54:17.220 --> 54:21.458
You see some of them memories,
they wasn't my own.

54:23.058 --> 54:24.561
Couldn't've been.

54:24.661 --> 54:27.177
Figured they used some kind of...

54:27.277 --> 54:29.709
...neural implant or something.

54:30.400 --> 54:34.662
Yeah. But before long
I knew everything about 'em.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.342
I knew that they had been here before...

54:38.642 --> 54:40.894
...and I know they coming back.

54:42.312 --> 54:46.516
I know we still be swimming
in tide pools if it wasn't for them.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.044
What?

54:50.052 --> 54:51.777
Found some of us hiding in caves...

54:51.877 --> 54:54.688
...when they came back
for the second set of adjustments.

54:56.159 --> 54:58.428
Then after the next visit...

54:58.528 --> 55:03.182
...homo sapiens were released upon the world.

55:04.700 --> 55:07.372
250,000 years later...

55:08.334 --> 55:10.976
...the next massive upgrade.

55:13.005 --> 55:16.662
Guess you could call it
a bump up in human evolution.

55:19.416 --> 55:23.027
Not exactly what they teach you
in Sunday school, is it?

55:24.487 --> 55:26.739
Why is this happening. Why?

55:29.028 --> 55:32.678
Did you know the first astronaut was a chimp?

55:33.662 --> 55:35.565
And the second was a dog.

55:37.720 --> 55:41.605
The point I'm making is that we seem to have
no problem with using the lesser species...

55:41.705 --> 55:44.875
...for all our godforsaken experiments.

55:44.975 --> 55:48.428
Poke 'em with this, prod 'em with that,
send 'em up in a rocket.

55:51.680 --> 55:55.465
I guess I figure,
we pretty much the same to them.

55:57.486 --> 56:01.792
So what you... you've known
about all this, about tonight...

56:01.892 --> 56:04.161
...and you didn't say a word to anybody?

56:04.261 --> 56:08.760
I did say something. I told everybody.
I told 'em all. Look.

56:11.300 --> 56:14.923
And they told me I was having
a transformation of my sense of reality.

56:16.573 --> 56:19.192
Damn visitors took everything from me.

56:20.075 --> 56:22.015
So tonight...

56:22.946 --> 56:27.433
...I'm gonna return the favor.

56:37.794 --> 56:39.479
Sleeping.

57:17.132 --> 57:18.984
Hey, Char.

57:21.736 --> 57:23.956
We're gonna get outta here, right?

57:27.376 --> 57:28.567
Hey.

57:30.846 --> 57:33.330
You think everything happens for a reason?

57:35.818 --> 57:39.054
I don't know. Why?

57:41.423 --> 57:43.509
I was driving that night.

57:46.562 --> 57:49.199
We were on our way home from San Francisco.

57:49.799 --> 57:52.102
I was on Cloud 9.

57:52.202 --> 57:55.605
She... she just said yes.

57:59.008 --> 58:01.378
I barely slept the whole night before...

58:01.478 --> 58:04.330
...but I thought I could make it.

58:06.849 --> 58:08.668
We were almost home.

58:11.103 --> 58:13.156
Maybe an hour outside L.A.

58:15.057 --> 58:17.302
And I woke up to her screams.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.942
<i>I'd been thrown from the vehicle, but...</i>

58:22.942 --> 58:25.402
<i>...she was still pinned under the dash.</i>

58:25.741 --> 58:28.805
- I'm stuck.
- I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

58:28.905 --> 58:30.907
<i>There was smoke everywhere.</i>

58:32.277 --> 58:34.879
- We gotta go. We gotta go right now. Come on.
- I can't. I can't.

58:34.979 --> 58:37.058
Come on. Come on.

58:38.381 --> 58:39.933
Rachel!

58:47.623 --> 58:49.509
I couldn't get her out in time.

58:53.262 --> 58:55.081
Oh, my God.

58:57.666 --> 58:59.552
I'm sorry.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.472
I think it's time to go.

59:34.637 --> 59:36.831
Hey, Brendan.

59:36.931 --> 59:38.708
Brendan, wake up.

59:38.808 --> 59:41.259
Hey, you okay?

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.582
- What the heck is he doing?
- You don't wanna know.

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.576
- Okay, yeah.
- You ready?

01:00:06.676 --> 01:00:09.888
Come on, time to go. Come on. Come on.

01:00:30.659 --> 01:00:33.711
Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie.
We gotta go, okay?

01:00:50.579 --> 01:00:52.449
Stay inside.

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:56.321
- Where you going?
- Lay out the welcome mat.

01:01:26.715 --> 01:01:28.018
Brendan?

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.535
Where is he? He's gone.

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.908
Get behind me!

01:02:39.988 --> 01:02:41.791
Your friend.

01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:44.129
Damn!

01:02:47.695 --> 01:02:49.547
Good luck.

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:56.172
What you waiting for?
What, a goodbye kiss or something?

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.957
- Why us?
- Why us?

01:02:59.057 --> 01:03:01.878
Why you trying to wonder why you so special?

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:05.145
Well, you're not. They're here for me.

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:09.353
Think we got some unfinished business.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.755
Yeah, sorry to break your heart, son.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:16.410
You just happened to be in the wrong
neck of the woods at the wrong time.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:19.045
You might wanna get
out of here while you still can.

01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:21.181
Hey, you coming?

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:25.335
Hell no! I ain't had
this much fun in 20 years.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.552
Let's go.

01:03:31.206 --> 01:03:33.042
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.394
- Wait.
- What?

01:03:37.372 --> 01:03:39.682
The lake's too exposed.
We're gonna be safer here in the trees.

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:42.586
No, no, no, no.
It's where they're meeting us.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:44.587
- Who?
- What?

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:47.425
- Who exactly did you talk to on the radio?
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:47.525 --> 01:03:50.894
We don't have time for any of your
second guessing bullshit, okay?

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.665
You just need to trust me on this, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

01:03:53.765 --> 01:03:56.855
- I'm not gonna lose you too, okay?
- That was not your fault.

01:03:56.955 --> 01:03:59.368
That was not your fault, okay?

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:02.320
- You can't let Rachel's death...
- Don't.

01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:11.848
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.
I'm going to the lake. I'm going.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.399
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:58.694
Annie, Annie.

01:05:04.733 --> 01:05:06.952
Annie. Annie.

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:12.056
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:05:13.308 --> 01:05:15.360
How 'bout that boat ride now?

01:05:31.326 --> 01:05:34.197
See, I told you.

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.748
I told you.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.174
Annie?

01:07:58.624 --> 01:08:00.275
Annie, is that you?

01:08:01.776 --> 01:08:03.362
Annie.

01:08:04.846 --> 01:08:06.699
Annie, where are you?

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.254
Annie?

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.273
Charlie!

01:08:29.103 --> 01:08:30.921
Who's there?

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.479
Charlie.

01:08:42.904 --> 01:08:44.435
Brendan?

01:08:45.553 --> 01:08:48.406
Hey, hey. Brendan, buddy.

01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:54.130
They... fixed me... Charlie.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.514
What do you mean?

01:08:58.066 --> 01:09:01.804
My leg, it doesn't hurt anymore.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:05.974
Just stay with me, okay, buddy?
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

01:09:13.798 --> 01:09:15.450
What is it, Charlie?

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:24.428
Come... come back.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.345
Where are you going?

01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:45.296
Charlie! Come back!

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:16.761
Hey, Rob. Rob!

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:27.623
Charlie.

01:10:28.523 --> 01:10:32.400
I lost it a little bit back there, didn't I,
man? I'm sorry about that, brother.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.330
I'm okay now.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.634
You don't see it that way?

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:42.272
You're afraid, Char.
I can hear your thoughts.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:45.457
But I don't know where they're keeping Annie.

01:10:46.975 --> 01:10:50.023
- Charlie?
- Annie?

01:10:57.485 --> 01:11:00.322
- Charlie?
- Annie? Annie!

01:11:02.457 --> 01:11:04.009
Annie?

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:12.534
Oh, thank God. Help me! Help me! Thank God.

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:14.636
- I'm sorry, okay?
- It's okay.

01:11:14.736 --> 01:11:16.765
- Let's just get out of here, okay?
- All right.

01:11:16.865 --> 01:11:18.456
Okay.

01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:21.110
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.028
- I can't feel my legs.
- Everything's gonna be okay, okay?

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:26.629
- Just...
- I can't. Something's holding me.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:35.840
Annie. Annie. Annie.

01:11:36.491 --> 01:11:39.561
Annie. Annie. Hey.

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:42.780
Annie. Annie. Annie.
Annie, stop. Stop, just... hey!

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.579
Charlie.

01:12:20.785 --> 01:12:22.620
Come back.

01:13:37.145 --> 01:13:38.730
Annie?

01:13:41.082 --> 01:13:42.901
Annie, is that you?

01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:54.484
- Rachel.
- Hi.

01:13:58.232 --> 01:14:01.052
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:14:06.307 --> 01:14:08.193
I missed you.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.698
Can you do something for me?

01:14:14.782 --> 01:14:16.335
Anything.

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:22.591
I need you to let me go.

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.260
No.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.296
Rachel, no.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.814
Please, Charlie.

01:14:31.332 --> 01:14:34.652
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:35.523 --> 01:14:37.756
Your new life's about to begin.

01:14:40.975 --> 01:14:42.845
It's okay.

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.231
Okay.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.514
You... you back from a hike?

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.013
Yeah.

01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:45.617
Do you remember what happened last night?

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:50.355
No. Must've been pretty crazy there, right?

01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:17.602
Dude, I feel super strong.

01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:38.503
Thanks.

01:17:41.225 --> 01:17:43.641
- Oy!
- Hey!

01:17:44.225 --> 01:17:45.394
How's it going?

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.996
- Morning.
- Feels great.

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:48.697
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.366
Good.

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:37.380
<i>The craft is still ascending.
Just lost visual.</i>

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.182
<i>Decrease your altitude
and begin assisting ground patrols.</i>

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.217
<i>Scan all areas of reported contact.</i>

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:45.521
<i>It's confirmed, sir.
The visitors are leaving.</i>

01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:48.872
<i>All the abducted appear
to have been returned.</i>

01:18:54.422 --> 01:18:55.848
Told you.

01:19:01.135 --> 01:19:04.704
<i>Earlier this morning, astronomers
reported a multitude of large objects...</i>

01:19:04.804 --> 01:19:08.144
<i>...that were detected passing
beyond our solar systems.</i>

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.730
<i>As suddenly as they appeared,
the mysterious visitors...</i>

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:14.844
<i>...have now departed with clear skies
being reported worldwide.</i>

01:19:14.944 --> 01:19:17.602
Well, looks like you missed your flight.

01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:27.810
<i>Meanwhile, an international coalition
has convened to determine...</i>

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:32.768
<i>...a quarantine protocol
for the estimated 20,000 returned.</i>

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.638
- <i>Ma'am, are you okay?</i>
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:38.073
<i>I feel amazing. You can just let me go.</i>

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.428
<i>Quarantine is now mandatory...</i>

01:19:40.528 --> 01:19:44.353
<i>...for anyone known to have made
contact with the visitors.</i>

01:19:56.257 --> 01:19:58.227
Your mom's texting you.

01:19:58.327 --> 01:19:59.811
What?

01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:09.087
How'd you know?

01:20:27.028 --> 01:20:28.677
What the hell is this?

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:31.075
What's this all about?

01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:41.437
Engine off.

01:20:43.971 --> 01:20:45.990
Everything all right, officer?

01:20:56.517 --> 01:20:59.337
Gonna need you to step out
of the vehicle, please.

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:14.936
Hold there.

01:21:17.471 --> 01:21:19.474
Is there a problem, officer?

01:21:20.274 --> 01:21:22.026
Not at all.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.384
- Got the markings.
- Are you sure?

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.335
What do you wanna do?

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.933
We need to kill them?

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.624
You can hear them?

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.453
What's going on?

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:33.617
No. No.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.992
Annie.

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.082
You okay?

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:10.068
Hey! She okay?

01:23:13.654 --> 01:23:15.540
Let's get out of here.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:19.313
Come on. Come on.

01:23:36.744 --> 01:23:38.313
Hey.

01:23:39.513 --> 01:23:41.316
Come on.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:43.301
Let's go.

01:23:50.157 --> 01:23:52.043
Come on.

01:24:00.367 --> 01:24:03.816
<i>Dispatch controller Tucker PD6682 on duty.</i>

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:07.618
<i>Radio check. All vehicles to commence.</i>

01:24:32.366 --> 01:24:36.254
<i>JG319 are you receiving? Please confirm.</i>

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:39.806
<i>Unit 131 is en route to burn the bodies.</i>

01:24:40.559 --> 01:24:44.231
<i>We're not sure yet what these returned
are actually capable of.</i>

01:25:05.599 --> 01:25:07.685
Looks like a storm's coming on.

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:11.122
Definitely.
