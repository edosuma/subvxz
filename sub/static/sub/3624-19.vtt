Baby and missing are
a bad combination.

00:16.341 --> 00:18.074
Right with you, K.P.

00:21.579 --> 00:23.747
Wade, need a DNA scan
of the baby's hair.

00:23.749 --> 00:25.715
Then an ultraviolet
sweep of the nursery.

00:25.717 --> 00:26.550
Ron?

00:26.552 --> 00:27.984
Look, I spelled Rufus.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.521
Woman: Kim Possible,
thank goodness you're here!

00:31.523 --> 00:33.757
We came as soon
as we heard your baby was...

00:33.759 --> 00:35.625
Right there in your arms?

00:35.627 --> 00:38.528
It's not our baby
that's missing.

00:38.530 --> 00:42.432
No! It's her... Her...

00:42.434 --> 00:45.502
You called us for
a missing pacifier?

00:45.504 --> 00:47.804
Can't you just buy a new one?

00:51.676 --> 00:53.543
[Beep] What up, Wade?

00:53.545 --> 00:57.814
Let me guess. A worldwide
wave of stolen pacifiers?

00:57.816 --> 00:59.349
Yeah. How did you know?

00:59.351 --> 01:00.083
Just a hunch.

01:00.085 --> 01:01.384
Whoever did this...

01:01.386 --> 01:07.357
I said, whoever
did this left a note!

01:07.726 --> 01:10.961
Ransom is spelled out
in little booties.

01:10.963 --> 01:13.730
Oh, that's adorable!

01:13.732 --> 01:16.700
And... achoo!
Dusty.

01:16.702 --> 01:20.036
Not dust. Baby powder.

01:20.772 --> 01:23.907
And... We're looking
at a rare baby talc,

01:23.909 --> 01:27.811
manufactured in the tiny English
village of Sheersomesheer.

01:27.813 --> 01:30.113
Well, it used to be.
Not anymore?

01:30.115 --> 01:32.883
The baby powder factory
has been closed for years.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.150
Sounds dead-ended.

01:34.152 --> 01:38.655
Sheersomesheer is also the home
of a nanny training academy.

01:38.657 --> 01:40.624
Oh, wait.
Also closed.

01:40.626 --> 01:42.559
It's double dead-ended. Yeah.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.960
It's the only lead we've got.

01:43.962 --> 01:45.662
Better check it out.

01:45.664 --> 01:47.697
[Wolf howls]

01:47.699 --> 01:52.769
Ok, the creepy factor's
in serious overfreak here.

01:52.771 --> 01:53.803
[Owl hoots]

01:53.805 --> 01:54.971
It's just an old house.

01:54.973 --> 01:56.673
It's not haunted.

01:56.675 --> 01:57.175
[Gong]

02:01.479 --> 02:03.747
Aah! It's a zombie!

02:03.749 --> 02:08.919
Not a zombie. Hi.
We're looking for Manny Mame.

02:08.921 --> 02:11.955
I'm Kim Possible
and this is Ron Stoppable.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.524
Hey. Hay is for
horses, young man!

02:14.526 --> 02:16.660
And do stand up straight.

02:16.662 --> 02:19.195
Your posture is atrocious!

02:19.197 --> 02:24.668
Dearie, there hasn't been
an academy here for years.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.736
No one needs nannies anymore,

02:26.738 --> 02:31.574
at least not nannies who know
how to handle unruly children.

02:31.576 --> 02:35.812
About the baby powder that
used to be manufactured here.

02:35.814 --> 02:40.050
Oh! Perhaps I can
help you with that.

02:40.052 --> 02:44.621
I would suggest
you take your questions

02:44.623 --> 02:48.825
and... Go elsewhere!

02:48.827 --> 02:50.026
Huh?
[Wolf howls]

02:50.028 --> 02:51.795
[Gasps]

02:52.797 --> 02:54.831
Let's see if the other
locals are friendlier.

02:54.833 --> 02:59.536
I'd settle for not as
bone-chillingly eerie.

03:00.771 --> 03:04.541
Welcome to the cow and cone.

03:04.543 --> 03:06.810
Would that be hand-scooped
or soft serve?

03:06.812 --> 03:11.114
I'm a scoop guy myself.
Pistachio, please.

03:11.116 --> 03:14.784
And how about you, miss?
What would you like?

03:14.786 --> 03:16.486
Information.
Certainly.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.253
Happy to help.

03:17.255 --> 03:19.856
It's about the nanny academy.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.527
Well, there was
an academy right enough.

03:24.529 --> 03:26.696
Lovely old place it was.
What happened?

03:26.698 --> 03:30.800
Oh, the times, miss. Same as
the rest of sheersomesheer.

03:30.802 --> 03:32.936
First, the baby powder
plant closed.

03:32.938 --> 03:35.839
Then people stopped
hiring nannies.

03:35.841 --> 03:39.109
And that's when they went into
the zombie business, right?

03:39.111 --> 03:40.910
Oh...
What's he on about?

03:40.912 --> 03:42.879
What about the old
woman we spoke to there?

03:42.881 --> 03:45.582
You spoke to...
Nanny Mame?

03:45.584 --> 03:48.785
Oh, you needn't worry
a tick about her.

03:48.787 --> 03:50.920
She's a lovely woman, that one.

03:50.922 --> 03:52.155
Salt of the earth.

03:52.157 --> 03:53.523
A heart of gold, she has.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.860
They don't make 'em
like her anymore.

03:56.862 --> 03:57.927
Why would they want to?

03:57.929 --> 03:59.162
What are they looking for?

03:59.164 --> 04:01.865
Not babies, miss.
Never babies.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.767
We likes babies
around here, we do.

04:03.769 --> 04:05.635
[Chuckles] That's right.

04:05.637 --> 04:08.071
Oh, yes. We like
babies just fine.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.140
But not snoopers like you.

04:10.142 --> 04:11.775
[Murmuring]

04:11.777 --> 04:15.712
Perhaps your order
should be for take-away.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.647
Things are way weird here.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.949
Yeah. Pistachio
is supposed to be green.

04:19.951 --> 04:22.786
We need to take another
look at that academy.

04:22.788 --> 04:27.724
Once you get past the purple,
this is good pistachio.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.225
Rufus: Mmm! Mmm!

04:29.227 --> 04:32.896
Bartender: Oh! Oh!
I didn't tell 'em nothing!

04:32.898 --> 04:35.598
I swear's I didn't!
[Glass breaking]

04:35.600 --> 04:38.635
I'll only be a sherbet then.

04:39.136 --> 04:42.572
[Owl hoots]

04:42.574 --> 04:45.708
Ron, infiltrating.
No crunch zone.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.177
Right.

04:47.179 --> 04:50.814
Oh! There's chocolate
at the bottom! Ha!

04:50.816 --> 04:52.916
[Sighs]

04:57.622 --> 05:02.792
Infrared shows something in
there is using a lot of power.

05:02.794 --> 05:05.862
But I have no idea what.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.640
Aah!

05:23.882 --> 05:27.884
This is possibly the sickest
thing I've ever seen.

05:27.886 --> 05:31.387
Sicker than the time you put
diablo sauce on pancakes?

05:31.389 --> 05:32.288
Much!

05:32.290 --> 05:34.257
[Gasps]

05:37.128 --> 05:38.628
Captured by babies.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.830
This is a new personal low.

05:40.832 --> 05:42.365
You got to admit
they were cute.

05:42.367 --> 05:45.802
Until they kicked our butts.

05:46.103 --> 05:48.004
Apparently during
your last visit,

05:48.006 --> 05:50.306
I did not make myself clear.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.176
You're creating an army
of super babies

05:53.178 --> 05:54.878
and using them
to steal pacifiers.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.779
Ok, now, see,
I was thinking that,

05:56.781 --> 05:58.848
but when you said it out loud,

05:58.850 --> 06:00.183
it sounded silly.
I know.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.186
Your impertinence
must be punished!

06:03.188 --> 06:05.021
[Teapot whistles] After tea.

06:05.023 --> 06:09.325
I'll keep her talking. You
see if Rufus can free us.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.693
Ok, right.
Rufus?

06:10.695 --> 06:13.830
Rufus, you got to
chew through these ropes.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.965
[Chuckling]

06:15.967 --> 06:18.768
So very naughty...
trying to muck up

06:18.770 --> 06:22.038
Nanny Mame's plans like this.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.341
Hmm...[Slurp]
What to do?

06:25.343 --> 06:27.210
You could tell us
what this is all about?

06:27.212 --> 06:30.113
That's sort of traditional
in situations like this.

06:30.115 --> 06:35.051
I trained the sternest nannies
the world has ever seen.

06:35.053 --> 06:36.819
But times changed.

06:36.821 --> 06:40.089
A stern nanny was
no longer the fashion.

06:40.091 --> 06:43.826
Fewer and fewer of
my graduates were hired.

06:43.828 --> 06:49.232
Finally, nanny had to close
her lovely academy for good.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.300
So, this is about revenge.

06:50.302 --> 06:52.936
Do not interrupt.
That is quite rude!

06:52.938 --> 06:55.738
Nanny Mame realized
she could make more money

06:55.740 --> 07:00.176
making children unhappy than
she could making them happy.

07:00.178 --> 07:02.212
Hey, what's more
traditional than grief?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.881
And the, um, hench babies?

07:04.883 --> 07:07.483
They show just what
traditional nannying

07:07.485 --> 07:09.752
and firm discipline
can accomplish.

07:09.754 --> 07:13.790
Also, feeding full-size
henchmen gets a bit pricey.

07:13.792 --> 07:16.960
Cheap. That's
traditional, too.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.864
The good guys getting free while
the bad guy explains the plan...

07:21.866 --> 07:27.003
you Americans have some
very strange traditions...

07:27.005 --> 07:30.206
ones for which
I don't much care.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.541
Get them!

07:31.543 --> 07:35.411
Ron Stoppable is more than
a match for any baby!

07:35.413 --> 07:39.115
I got a little sis
myself, so bring it on!

07:39.117 --> 07:43.920
Ohh! I meant
one at a time. Aah!

07:44.121 --> 07:45.788
How do I fight babies?

07:45.790 --> 07:48.925
How do you not fight them?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.493
Aah! Hey, watch
the face!

07:50.495 --> 07:54.998
That's it, dearies.
Make nanny proud.

08:00.371 --> 08:02.138
Aah!

08:02.873 --> 08:05.808
Man, these are
some tough babies.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.243
[Rufus chattering]

08:07.245 --> 08:08.811

08:08.813 --> 08:11.547
Hey, that tickles.
Ha ha!

08:11.549 --> 08:14.284
Oh, this is embarrassing.

08:17.388 --> 08:19.522
Boo-yah.

08:20.991 --> 08:23.993
Don't be a baby, Ron.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.930
It's very bad manners

08:27.932 --> 08:30.366
to play with your food!

08:38.876 --> 08:41.077
Whoa!

08:41.812 --> 08:43.379
[Gasp]

08:44.915 --> 08:47.850
These aren't like the
babies you're used to.

08:47.852 --> 08:50.553
They're as strong
as full-grown men.

08:50.555 --> 08:53.122
Well, the babies I'm used to...

08:53.124 --> 08:57.126
Of course. This isn't
a save the world thing.

08:57.128 --> 08:59.829
It's a babysitting thing.

09:00.297 --> 09:06.536
Uh-oh. Where did
Kimmy go?

09:06.538 --> 09:07.904
She's right there!

09:07.906 --> 09:09.605
You're acting...
[Stammers]

09:09.607 --> 09:11.040
Like children!

09:33.497 --> 09:34.530
Ooh!

09:34.532 --> 09:37.900
Stop her!

09:38.869 --> 09:41.971
Goo-goo, gah, gah.

09:47.177 --> 09:51.114
[Giggling]

10:02.960 --> 10:05.928
Ron: Glad that's over.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.497
Um, it's not quite over.

10:07.499 --> 10:10.566
How many times did you go
through that machine?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.135
I lost count. Why?

10:12.137 --> 10:13.669
You know, I find
the giant diaper

10:13.671 --> 10:15.605
a delightful change of pace.

10:15.607 --> 10:19.976
Woman, sighing: We finally
got her settled down.

10:19.978 --> 10:21.244
She's asleep now.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.912
We recovered the pacifier.

10:22.914 --> 10:26.182
Got it right here, K.P. [Gasp]

10:26.184 --> 10:28.317
Heh, heh. I'll just
wipe it off.

10:28.319 --> 10:32.555
Oops! Ok, wait, now.
I got it.

10:34.525 --> 10:36.292
Don't worry, don't worry.

10:36.294 --> 10:37.693
There's plenty more
where that came from.

10:37.695 --> 10:41.497
How about this one?
No? Ok. This one?

10:41.499 --> 10:43.699
I think this one's
from France. No?

10:43.701 --> 10:45.101
You like pink?
Oh, come on.

10:45.103 --> 10:49.505
Everybody likes pink.
How about this one?

10:51.208 --> 10:52.608
[Purring]

10:56.580 --> 10:58.548
[Screams]

11:08.292 --> 11:09.525
Ohh! [Spits]
