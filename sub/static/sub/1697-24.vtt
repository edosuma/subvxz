00:19.400 --> 00:22.440
Why aren't there any eggs on my fork?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.390
Grow up. You got two hands,
make your own breakfast.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.110
Why are you so cranky?

00:27.160 --> 00:29.670
Because nobody made my breakfast.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.000
But it's Saturday.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.350
Daddy always makes my eggs.
l hope he's not sick.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.990
Hey, Daddy, are you feeling okay?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.310
l'm fine.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.390
Well, then, get to cooking,
good-looking.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.190
My eggs ain't gonna
scramble themselves.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.950
No, they're not.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.470
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l got some jogging to do.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.000
l'd hate to be your scratching post,
Mr Sour Puss N' Boots.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.750
What's the matter?
Your blow-dryer's on the fritz?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.310
Oh, no. l know what it is, Daddy.

01:03.360 --> 01:07.590
You had a dream that l was
the only child and you woke up to that.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.920
No, sadly, l woke up to both of you.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.710
Wow. He really is upset.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.230
-What did you do?
-What did you do?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.870
-Me? Yes, you!
-Me? Yes, you!

01:20.920 --> 01:22.670
-Stop that!
-Stop that!

01:28.360 --> 01:29.950
<i>come on</i>!

02:20.560 --> 02:22.550
Hey, where are my eggs?

02:23.320 --> 02:24.670
Right.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.870
Enjoy.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.910
Miles, that's what l love about you.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.160
You're not just pretty.
You're pretty and funny.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.720
Thanks, Jackson.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.670
You know,
maybe l will make you some eggs.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.880
Wait, that would make me
pretty, funny and stupid.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.870
Well, you left out selfish,
which now that l think about it,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.990
is probably
why Dad's in such a bad mood.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.110
What are you talking about?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.110
l'm talking about
the way you acted last night

03:04.160 --> 03:07.280
before you went to
your stupid party. Remember?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.950
You are gorgeous.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.230
The only problem with being me

03:16.280 --> 03:19.950
is that everybody else
gets to look at me all the time,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.110
and l only get glimpses.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.390
-Excuse me, sister dear.
-What?

03:27.960 --> 03:31.270
Could l just use
a small corner of the mirror?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.310
l'd like to try to look good,
so that way l don't offend you.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.630
Try putting a paper bag
over your head, Ug-face.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.550
Did you miss me? l missed you.
Yes, l did. You're so pretty.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.790
Miley Stewart, if you'd stop
worshipping your reflection,

03:49.840 --> 03:52.880
you might just realise that other people
live in this house besides you

03:52.920 --> 03:55.350
and that big, fat head of yours.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.910
You mean big, fat, gorgeous head.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.960
Okay, so which one of you bozos
are driving this teen pop sensation

04:07.000 --> 04:08.720
to another glamorous Hollywood party

04:08.760 --> 04:12.230
that l'm too shallow to realise
is totally pointless?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.470
So you're really going out? Tonight?

04:15.520 --> 04:19.990
No, l put this outfit on
to stare at you eating that cupcake.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.630
Hello, somebody turn the lights on
in there.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.190
Father, even though
it will make me late for my date,

04:29.240 --> 04:30.880
l'll be happy to drive her.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.720
You do so much.

04:33.400 --> 04:37.680
lt would be a privilege to ease
your burden in any way that l can.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.390
Jackson, you are an angel
sent from heaven above.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.790
Please, let me share
my cupcake with you.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.390
Perhaps just a nibble.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.830
lf you two ladies are done
with your little wimp-fest,

05:01.880 --> 05:03.790
people are waiting to drool over me.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.190
Come on. Let's go, chop-chop.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.110
-Unbelievable!
-l know, Dad. l know.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.870
Okay, that is so not what happened.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.640
You are the one who acted like a jerk

05:21.680 --> 05:24.070
before you went on your stupid date
last night.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.600
What are you talking about?

05:25.640 --> 05:29.270
l'm talking about the way
it really happened. Remember?

05:32.600 --> 05:36.230
Why did l ever agree
to attend this frivolous affair?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.230
l mean, after all, Father,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.160
the most valuable thing we have
is time.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.480
Perhaps l should spend mine
bettering myself through study.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.280
So young, so wise.
You are my favourite child.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.790
Out of the way, fish face.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.430
ls that Brad Pitt?

06:00.480 --> 06:04.840
No, wait, it's me.
Stewart. Jackson Stewart.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.190
Double-Oh-My, licence to thrill.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.110
So, you're really going out? Tonight?

06:13.160 --> 06:15.880
No, l got all handsomed up

06:15.920 --> 06:18.230
to watch Tv with you until you doze off

06:18.280 --> 06:21.910
and drown out the <i>Hee Ha</i> w reruns
with your nose whistle.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.590
Jackson, please don't make fun
of our father like that,

06:28.640 --> 06:33.510
for someday, he will be gone
and we will miss him terribly.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.150
Don't worry, Father.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.320
l'll always love you
enough for the both of us.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.350
Miley, you are an angel
sent from heaven above.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.990
Unlike your brother,
who comes from the opposite direction.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.080
Now, Son,
l want you to take your sister...

06:57.120 --> 06:59.510
No, no, no, no!

06:59.560 --> 07:01.470
l'm sick of driving her everywhere.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.510
You do it.
lt'll fill that empty void you call your life.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.560
Please, drive me just this once?

07:10.600 --> 07:15.070
You don't even have to stop.
Just slow down, and l'll tuck and roll.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.350
Fine!

07:25.520 --> 07:27.110
Unbelievable!

07:27.160 --> 07:29.670
l know, Daddy. l know.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.360
And that is obviously
why Dad is in such a bad mood.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.710
Wow. Miley World sounds fun!

07:41.760 --> 07:44.990
How do you get to school,
on a unicorn?

07:46.960 --> 07:50.870
Fine. We'll just wait for Dad to get back
from his jog and we'll ask him.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.520
Yeah, we will.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.990
And then, we'll find out that l'm the one
that has the perfect memory.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.670
Really? Do you remember
when you put in that waffle?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.670
l paid for half of those.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.790
See, this is why you don't get dates.
l'm a girl. Be nice.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.990
And this is why you don't get dates.
You eat like a pig.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.830
You take that back!

08:29.720 --> 08:31.750
And you take this back.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.270
Fine. Look, your half, my half.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.830
-Fine.
-Fine.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.909
Hey, Mr Stewart. What's up?

08:41.960 --> 08:45.470
Never have kids.
They'll only break your heart.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.480
Now l know why he doesn't get dates.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.750
Yeah, my mom went there once.
Never going back.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.990
-Wait! Don't eat that chip!
-Why? lt was on my side.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.670
No, no, no, look!
lt's a barbecue-flavoured Darth vader!

09:07.320 --> 09:09.200
This is incredible.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.670
Dudes! Dudes!

09:13.720 --> 09:18.160
This is cooler than when my alphabet
soup spelled ''yixagirple-dink.''

09:20.200 --> 09:21.470
l'll give you five bucks for it.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.510
-l'll give you six.
-Seven.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.240
Okay, Dad is coming back from his jog.
Get ready to eat your words!

09:35.280 --> 09:36.920
That's right, buddy boy.
ln five seconds,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.190
Dad is going to tell you...

09:42.480 --> 09:45.310
Me. And you can take that to the bank.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.390
-Go ahead, apologise.
-Me? You apologise.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.630
Fine.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.150
Daddy, l'm sorry...

10:00.280 --> 10:04.030
...that Jackson was such a jerk
about driving me last night!

10:04.080 --> 10:09.760
And l'm sorry that your daughter
is a mirror-hogging, ride-mooching,

10:09.800 --> 10:13.430
bottomless pit
of ''me, me, me, me, me.''

10:16.960 --> 10:19.350
This isn't about mirrors or rides.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.630
You know what? l shouldn't have
to explain it to either one of you.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.030
Figure it out for yourselves.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.190
Then what really did happen
last night?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.510
Hold on!

10:36.080 --> 10:38.390
lf it wasn't how you acted...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.190
And it's not how you acted...

10:43.520 --> 10:45.670
And he ain't gonna tell us anything.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.750
Well, then what was it?

10:49.280 --> 10:50.630
The mail!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.960
-l bet it was your report card.
-l bet it was your phone bill.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.630
lt was not my... Well, it's possible.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.640
lt's just nothing
but a bunch of birthday cards.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.630
-For Dad.
-On his 40th.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.750
Which was yesterday.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.150
-l can't believe you forgot!
-l can't believe you forgot!

11:13.200 --> 11:14.600
-Me? Yes, you!
-Me? Yes, you!

11:14.640 --> 11:16.590
-Stop that!
-Stop that!

11:20.320 --> 11:24.630
Okay, so we forgot his birthday.
We're probably not the only ones.

11:24.680 --> 11:31.070
Mamaw, Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl,
Roxy, Aunt Dolly.

11:31.120 --> 11:35.750
Even Bucky's BBQ
sent him a coupon for a free mud pie.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.710
He's 40 now, he doesn't need that.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.910
Jackson, this is serious.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.870
We forgot one of the biggest birthdays
of his life.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.950
Now all we can do is apologise.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.030
Nothing we can do?

11:52.080 --> 11:55.280
Miley, Miley, Miley.
Have l taught you nothing?

11:56.160 --> 12:00.950
Now close your eyes, find your centre,
and try to put yourself into my brain.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.470
-Now you see what l see.
-This is perfect.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.430
We plan a surprise party
and make Dad think we never forgot.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.360
Wow, that's way better than my idea
of stealing his coin jar

12:23.400 --> 12:25.710
and running away to Mexico.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.670
Miley, you need to get down here,

12:32.720 --> 12:35.870
or you're gonna be late
for the big CD signing.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.390
You know, maybe 40 minutes late.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.960
The big 4-0.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.640
Nothing.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.590
Hey. l got the decorations.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.990
Great. The cake will be here in an hour.
Let me see.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.510
Happy Fifth Birthday?

13:03.240 --> 13:04.960
Well, they were all out
of ''Happy 40th's,''

13:05.000 --> 13:08.200
so l got four ''fives'' and two ''tens.''

13:08.240 --> 13:12.120
Hey, adding is good for old people.
lt keeps the mind agile.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.030
Coming! Here's Dad's PDA.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.470
Try to get as many of his friends
to come as you can.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.510
Leave it all to me.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.350
Sadly, l have no choice.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.710
Hey, Mr Adams, it's Jackson.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.480
We're throwing a surprise party
for Dad.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.920
Tonight.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.080
No, we didn't forget.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.160
Tonight.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.430
No, we didn't forget.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.990
Okay, so we forgot!

13:50.120 --> 13:53.790
Your Christmas lights are still up.
Who are you to judge?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.680
So are you coming?

13:56.720 --> 13:59.030
Hello? Hello?

14:00.760 --> 14:02.990
Look, l don't care
if your wife is in labour.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.390
Just tell her to pop that sucker out
and get over here!

14:06.440 --> 14:07.710
Hello?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.880
l got 50, 50.
Who'll take Darth home for 60?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.680
$60 for this one of a kind,
deep-fried sci-fi icon.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.840
-Who'll give us 70? 70?
-l'll give you 1 00.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.110
l think the chip's alive.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.070
l was on my way to scuba lessons

14:49.120 --> 14:52.190
when l heard the sound of money
being made without me.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.550
Unacceptable.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.400
Yo, back off, Rico. Okay?
This has nothing to do with you.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.950
Where'd you get the chip?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.990
-ln a bag we bought from the shack.
-Yeah.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.990
Do you have the receipt?

15:06.040 --> 15:09.830
l keep every receipt.
My dad's an accountant.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.470
An accountant.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.510
Well, the ''accountant''

15:15.480 --> 15:19.230
probably should have taught you
how to read the fine print.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.920
Read it and weep.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.430

Hi!

Why am l staring
at a bunch of total strangers?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.190
They're not total strangers.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.990
This is Jerry, the mailman.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.320
Georgie, the gas metre
checker lady gal.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.830

Twenty years of blowing up balloons.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.310
Okay.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.030
And who are they?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.800
l found them at the beach.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.270
They call themselves ''The Aristocrats.''

18:52.400 --> 18:53.990
Hit it, kids!

19:08.040 --> 19:10.920
This is the best you could do?

19:10.960 --> 19:13.790
As soon as Dad sees this, he's gonna...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.190
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.790

19:31.240 --> 19:33.190
Happy birthday, Robby!

19:48.640 --> 19:51.600
Didn't see that one coming,
did you, Daddy?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.630
And you thought we forgot.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.710
Thanks for coming, everybody!

20:03.760 --> 20:06.320
Thanks. Y'all are fantastic!

20:07.760 --> 20:09.710
You rock, Robby Ray!

20:11.080 --> 20:15.440
Next year, 41 ! You're all invited!
Don't forget!

20:19.280 --> 20:24.030
Wow, what a party.
Good times, good times.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.990
Yeah. Happy birthday, big guy!

20:27.440 --> 20:29.190
Hold it, you two.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.630
Okay.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.120
We forgot your birthday.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.950
And when we tried to get people,
it was all, ''l'm out of town,''

20:39.000 --> 20:42.350
or ''l'm in jail,'' or ''l'm giving birth.''

20:44.800 --> 20:46.750
We're sorry, Daddy.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.680
We're selfish, horrible kids

20:49.720 --> 20:52.390
who don't deserve a dad
as wonderful as you.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.390
Let's not oversell it.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.000
No, she's right, l am a wonderful dad.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.470
And when you forgot my birthday, well,

21:01.520 --> 21:03.830
it just kind of made me feel
like you didn't appreciate me.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.760
But we do appreciate you, Daddy.
You got to believe that.

21:08.840 --> 21:13.280
Actually, after the party
y'all put together this evening,

21:14.160 --> 21:15.720
l do believe you.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.670
Because it takes a lot of effort
to put together a train wreck like this.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.950
We really do love you, Dad.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.040
l know. Maybe next year,
you could just love me on time.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.550
Come on, l'm a man. Men don't hug.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.790
-Stewart men do.
-Yeah, we do.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.640
So, what'd you guys get me?

21:44.440 --> 21:47.750
Free mud pie from Bucky's BBQ!

21:48.960 --> 21:50.870
lt's from both of us.
