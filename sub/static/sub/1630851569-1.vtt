04:15.255 --> 04:17.464
Excuse me, sir.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.439
My name's Barrett, sir.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.820
Oh, God, of course.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.947
I'm so sorry. I fell asleep.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.034
- We've got an appointment.
- Yes, sir.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.537
- What time?
- Three o'clock, sir.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.914
Well, what time is it now?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.041
Three o'clock, sir.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.334
Oh.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.048
It's too many beers at lunch,
that's what it is.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.634
- Do you drink beer?
- No. No, I don't, sir.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.267
Well, come upstairs.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.316
We can sit down.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.493
I'm just back from Africa.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.454
I'm quite liking it.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.836
- What do you think of the house?
- It's very nice, sir.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.963
Needs a lot done to it, of course.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.685
Damn lucky to get this place, actually.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.645
Little bit of wet rot, but not much.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.402
Sit down.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.738
Thank you, sir.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.034
Sit down.

06:15.583 --> 06:19.503
Well, now, this post...
What's happening is this.

06:19.629 --> 06:23.757
I'll be moving into this house
in about two or three weeks' time.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.718
And I'm all alone at the moment

06:26.844 --> 06:29.638
so I'll be needing
a manservant, you see.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.890
I've seen one or two chaps already.

06:32.016 --> 06:35.352
But they didn't seem
very suitable to me, somehow.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.940
What...?

06:41.859 --> 06:44.986
You've had experience
of this kind of work, have you?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.948
I've been in service
for the last 13 years, sir.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.534
For the last few years I've acted as...

06:50.660 --> 06:54.538
personal manservant
to various members of the peerage.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.250
I was with Viscount Barr
until about five weeks ago.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.335
Oh, Lord Barr?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.129
My father knew him well.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.257
They died within a week of each other,
as a matter of fact.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.138
- So you're free?
- Yes, I am, sir.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.063
- Do you like the work?
- Oh, I do.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.857
I do. I like it very much, sir.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.859
Can you cook?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.653
Well, it's...

07:26.779 --> 07:28.947
If I might put it this way, sir,

07:29.073 --> 07:31.700
cooking is something
I take a great deal of pride in.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.286
Any dish in particular?

07:35.121 --> 07:40.959
Well, my soufflés have always received
a great deal of praise in the past.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.962
Do you know anything
about Indian dishes?

07:44.088 --> 07:47.507
- Oh, well, a little.
- Well, I know a hell of a lot.

07:49.677 --> 07:53.305
- You'd have to do all the cooking.
- That would give me great pleasure.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.808
I could have got a housekeeper
to run the kitchen.

07:56.934 --> 08:01.104
But the thought of some old woman
telling me what to do put me off.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.231
Yes, quite, sir.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.358
Now, apart from the cooking...

08:07.528 --> 08:08.945
I'll need...

08:13.576 --> 08:14.993
well...

08:18.039 --> 08:20.665
everything,
general looking-after, you know.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.584
Yes, I do, sir.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.972
- Brazil?
- Yes, in the jungle.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.119
Waiter.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.754
- We've got to clear the jungle first.
- What, just you?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.798
No, no.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.552
It's a giant development and
they're going to build three cities.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.513
- Are they?
- Mm. Gigantic project.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.432
A matter of clearing
hundreds of miles of jungle.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.686
I'll have another bottle.
And by the way, this one's corked.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.229
I'm very sorry, sir.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.772
- You're corked!
- Listen.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.651
You see,
first we have to build the cities.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.821
Then we've got to find the people
to go and live in the cities.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.739
Where are you going to find them?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.867
From Asia Minor.
There are thousands of peasants.

09:38.744 --> 09:43.248
They're having a rough time of it
and this will mean a new life for them.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.628
Anyway, he wants me
to help arrange the whole thing.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.505
It's going to cost millions.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.257
Millions. Fine.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.176
- I'm having lunch with him next week.
- In the jungle?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.723
Either here or in Paris, actually.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.232
Yes, fine.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.988
Anyway, there's no hurry.
I could do with a rest.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.450
I'm sure you could.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.410
No, seriously, Susan.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.122
What do you think of the idea?

10:26.792 --> 10:27.792
Cosy.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.996
Do you want to go there?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.706
Where?

11:06.832 --> 11:09.042
The jungle.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.835
Mm-mm. Not now.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.713
No, not now.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.697
Bachelor.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.620
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.372
I found a manservant.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.669
A what?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.594
What about the landing, sir?

12:05.808 --> 12:06.808
White.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.316
Well, perhaps a little blue
here and there.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.027
But I think the overall colour
should be white.

12:18.154 --> 12:22.240
Well, mandarin red and fuchsia
is a very chic combination this year.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.826
Not overall, surely?

12:24.952 --> 12:27.579
- No, sir, not overall.
- Just a wall.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.622
Yes, just a wall here and there, sir.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.336
You're very knowledgeable
about decoration.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.173
- It makes all the difference in life.
- What does?

12:39.049 --> 12:41.468
Tasteful and pleasant surroundings.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.388
Now you've said a mouthful.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.390
Now, that's your room.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.564
Here's the bathroom.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.403
Wait a minute. What's that?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.951
Box room.

13:08.078 --> 13:11.664
- always do for a maid, sir.
- Oh, we'll have a cleaning woman.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.750
Do you think we'll need a maid?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.543
Well, they can be useful, sir.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.099
Now, look here.
You mind that paintwork.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.645
Oh!

13:40.361 --> 13:42.570
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

13:42.696 --> 13:46.908
Tell me of any problems so we can
correct it before it becomes a fault.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.384
Lunch, sir.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.470
- Green salad.
- Oh, that's nice.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.055
No trouble, sir.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.310
- How are they getting on?
- I'm keeping my eye on them.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.854
Are you?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.110
You might bring me a lager.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.864
I'm just about to, sir.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.158
I'm ready for it.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.161
Sir.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.273
How about that, then?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.025
- OK?
- Yes.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.324
Ah.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.750
This is Barrett, Susan.
Barrett, my fiancée, Miss Stewart.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.085
- Hello.
- Evening. Shall I take your coat?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.421
Er, no, I'll keep it on, thanks.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.547
Here.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.559
Do you like it?

15:36.685 --> 15:38.728
Mm.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.480
It's beautiful.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.859
simple and classic
is always best, Miss.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.819
Is this classic?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.988
This isn't classic.
It's prehistoric.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.449
We've always had it
and I like it.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.160
- Barrett, let's have a drink.
- Yes, sir.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.662
Vodka on the rocks.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.247
- And for you the usual, sir?
- Thank you.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.294
Which one do you want?

16:04.838 --> 16:07.048
Oh, this one.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.800
My mother's favourite.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
Thank you.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.027
The place needs lightening,
more variety, you know, colour.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.737
Oh, do you think so?

16:29.863 --> 16:33.658
Yes, and tomorrow I'll organise
a spice shelf for the kitchen.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.917
- Would you like to taste the wine?
- Thank you.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.046
- What ducky gloves.
- Barrett's idea.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.798
I like it.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.134
It's Italian, Miss.
They're used in Italy.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.510
Who by?

16:52.636 --> 16:53.636
Excellent.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.475
Just a Beaujolais, sir,
but a good bottler.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.646
- A good what?
- bottler.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.394
- Oh, is this necessary?
- Well, better be safe than sorry, sir.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.899
You're too skinny
to be a nanny, Barrett.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.486
Oh, come on. Don'tsulk.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.029
I didn't mean it.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.907
Oh.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.454
Splendid.

18:46.917 --> 19:00.596

19:15.445 --> 19:17.989
Any news from your new frontier?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.533
No. No, there isn't, actually.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.704
Well, he had to go over there
and make various arrangements.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.789
Heads of government and all that.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.960
- Heard from him?
- Yes.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.714
I mean, of course, the whole idea
is in a very preliminary stage.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.594
Still, I'm quite happy at the moment.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.137
Aren't you?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.681
Mm.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.269
I can manage for a good few months.

19:50.105 --> 19:54.692
Oh, Barrett has installed
my new abstract in the garden.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.652
Looks very chic.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.988

21:17.609 --> 21:19.860
Why don't you come and stay?

21:22.656 --> 21:25.741
For a weekend, a long weekend.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.954
Or a couple of weeks.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.665
Marry me.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.726
I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.481
I'm sorry.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.193
Doesn't he know enough to knock?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.904
He made a mistake.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.031
Mistake?

22:06.616 --> 22:09.493
Well, for God's sake,
restrict him to quarters.

22:17.586 --> 22:21.255
- Couldn't he live out?
- Out? No, he couldn't.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.138
Well, he doesn't have to be here
after he's washed up the dinner things.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.766
Well, he's got to lock up.

22:36.563 --> 22:40.066
- Well, I think I should go, anyway.
- Well, why?

22:40.192 --> 22:43.402
- I'm just going.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

22:48.825 --> 22:53.287
- Come home and stay with me.
- Oh, look, stay here.

23:02.714 --> 23:06.634
It's a bit late for you, Barrett.
About time you were tucked up in bed.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.180
All right, Barrett.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.898
- I'll drive you back.
- No.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.568
Well, I'll walk along with you, then.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.154
No.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.905
I do apologise for the intrusion, sir.
I had no idea.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.366
Don't do it again.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.499
- I did knock, sir.
- Oh, get to bed.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.221
Have you got an aspirin?

24:35.056 --> 24:36.056
Yes, sir.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.438
I expect you caught a chill
the other day in the rain.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.401
Yes, rain.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.321
The other day.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.075
I'll get the aspirin.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.331
- Would you like a nice hot drink?
- There's no need for that.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.803
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.647
- You need some more air.
- Oh, I don't know.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.398
No, you don't.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.508
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.052
They're beautiful.
Thanks very much.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.767
Every time you open a door
in this house, that man's outside.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.603
- He's a peeping Tom.
- Yes.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.606
He's a vampire too
on his Sundays off!

26:09.109 --> 26:11.860
Why didn't you have them
in your room?

26:11.987 --> 26:15.072
Well, he was saying that they're bad
in a sick room at night.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.616
Come in.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.375
- Your medicine, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.085
And the post.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.422
What did the doctor say yesterday?

26:31.548 --> 26:33.966
Oh, nothing much, virus.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.843
Put that down.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.554
Oh, put it down, Barrett.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.727
I beg your pardon, sir.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.524
I do wish you'd stop
yapping at Barrett.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.401
It will be a bastard if he leaves.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.614
What the hell would that matter?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.532
What would it matter?

26:58.658 --> 27:00.659
You try and find another like him.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.122
I'm sorry I was rude to your servant.

27:05.248 --> 27:08.834
Look, he may be a servant
but he's still a human being.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.933
I'm afraid
it's not very encouraging, Miss.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.644
The weather forecast.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.042
Oh, there's somebody in already.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.002
Here's the number right here.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.046
Oh, I haven't got any pennies.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.673
'Hello?'

27:57.342 --> 28:00.135
- Bolton 625-45?
- 'Yes.'

28:00.261 --> 28:03.180
Get me Vera.
I'm speaking from London.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.932
'Vee!

28:05.058 --> 28:07.142
'Vera?

28:07.268 --> 28:09.269
'A call for you from London.'

28:11.231 --> 28:12.898
- 'Hello?'
- Vera?

28:13.024 --> 28:14.316
'Yes.'

28:14.442 --> 28:16.443
- Are you ready?
- 'Yeah, I'm ready.'

28:17.278 --> 28:19.071
Hurry up, darling!

28:20.448 --> 28:21.949
All right, then. Tomorrow.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.368
'All right.
I've bought something new.'

28:24.494 --> 28:26.829
- Mm-hm.
- 'I'm wearing it now.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.831
'I'll show you
if you're a good boy.'

28:28.957 --> 28:31.750
- I am.
- Come on.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.544
Get on with it!

28:33.670 --> 28:36.088
- Are you being a good girl?
- 'What?'

28:36.214 --> 28:38.549
Tell her to...

28:40.051 --> 28:42.094
I said, are you being a good girl?

28:42.220 --> 28:44.054
'Yeah, I am.'

28:45.140 --> 28:46.932
I'll be at the station.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.184
- Hurry up!
- You got my last letter?

28:49.310 --> 28:52.771
- 'Oh, yeah. I got that all right.'
- All right, then.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.607
- At the station.
- For heaven's sake!

28:55.734 --> 28:57.192
- Ta-ra.
- 'Bye.'

29:01.030 --> 29:03.157
Oh, here he is.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.451
Get out of the way, you filthy bitch.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.662
- What?
- Ooh, get him!

29:08.788 --> 29:09.830
Come on.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.922
You've mulled
some delicious claret, Barrett.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.885
I say, that's rather good, isn't it?
Clarety Barrett.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.556
In the army they used
to call me Basher Barrett, sir.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.308
Oh, really? Why?

29:31.853 --> 29:33.979
I was a very good driller.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.439
Ah.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.067
I like the changes
you've made to the house.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.613
- You've been enjoying yourself.
- I have, sir. Thank you very much.

29:44.866 --> 29:49.369
Oh, by the way, sir,
I took the liberty of removing those...

29:49.496 --> 29:53.123
chintz frills of Miss Stewart's
off the dressing table.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.293
Not very practical.

29:59.464 --> 30:03.425
Haven't seen very much
of Miss Stewart recently, have we, sir?

30:03.551 --> 30:04.593
No.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.887
My sister's arriving tomorrow,
as agreed.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.013
Yes, fine.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.973
She's happy
about the arrangement.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.017
We might keep her
if she's any good.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.162
Thank you.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.794
- He's a wonderful wit.
- Terribly funny.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.379
- Terribly.
- Cheers.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.713
Cheers.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.551
I'm dying to see him again.
I haven't seen him for ages.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.095
- You won't for some time.
- Oh, why?

30:48.221 --> 30:49.972
He's in prison.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.478
Hello.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.105
Good morning, Miss Stewart.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.065
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.693
- Very nice to see you here again.
- Thank you.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.320
I can recommend the roast duck.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.198
Thank you.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.200
And what are you having?

31:10.910 --> 31:13.245
- Are you better?
- Yes, thanks.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.216
I've brought you a present.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.678
- What for?
- Because I wanted to.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.980
- Where the hell are you going?
- Sorry, your Grace.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.611
You're Irish, aren't you, my child?

31:45.737 --> 31:48.488
- Good morning, Bishop.
- Good morning.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.538
Thank you.

32:15.391 --> 32:18.644
- What did she say to you?
- Nothing.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.771
Yes, she did.
She said something to you.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.774
- She didn't, really.
- She did.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.734
I saw her mouth move.

32:27.111 --> 32:30.405
She whispered something to you.
What was it?

32:30.531 --> 32:34.785
- What did she whisper to you?
- She didn't whisper anything to me.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.995
She didn't whisper anything.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.665
Why don't we go away?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.333
For a few days, hm?

32:41.459 --> 32:43.502
Where?

32:43.628 --> 32:45.045
Anywhere.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.591
Agatha and Willie Mountset
have invited us down, actually.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.679
Well, why don't we go there?

32:53.805 --> 32:56.306
Yes, we could, I suppose.

33:08.444 --> 33:12.698
I hear Father O'Flaherty won't be
at the Cork convocation.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.658
Flaherty

33:14.784 --> 33:18.954
Your man wouldn't miss that trip.
You can bet your last pound on that.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.581
Didn't they have
to carry him out last time?

33:21.708 --> 33:24.334
For God's sake,
who didn't they have to carry out?

33:27.296 --> 33:29.464
I just don't like him.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.216
You don't know him.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.596
- Surely you can take my word...
- I don't trust him.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.933
- Why?
- I don't know.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.769
It's the snow.
It's the snow that I love.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.066
Yes, he looks like a fish
with red lips, I'll admit.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.028
But apart from that,
what's the matter with him?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.198
Stop making him so bloody important.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.702
You've got the whole thing
absurdly out of proportion.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.413
Yes, perhaps.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.630
And where are you creeping off to now,
my son?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.382
Nowhere, your Grace, nowhere.

34:12.507 --> 34:14.926
- Nowhere at all.
- Is that a fact?

34:20.766 --> 34:23.893
Why don't you just tell him to go?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.645
You must be mad.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.524
You just don't care about my...

34:29.650 --> 34:32.652
What it amounts to is
it's my judgment you're criticising.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.864
That's not only ridiculous,
it's bloody hurtful.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.658
- They were gorgeous.
- Were they really?

34:40.703 --> 34:42.496
I'm sorry. I'm a fool.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.248
You are.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.752
Well, I mean...

34:48.878 --> 34:51.963
Divine, darling,
but I simply couldn't get them on.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.130
Pity.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.427
Look... I'm sorry.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.679
No.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.016
Well, I wouldn't...

35:21.702 --> 35:24.538
- I shall be late for my appointment.
- Taxi!

35:28.334 --> 35:30.085
140 Berkeley Square.

36:08.958 --> 36:25.307
Barrett?

36:34.275 --> 36:36.985
- Did you call, sir?
- Yes.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.821
Damned awful lunch.
Where were you?

36:39.947 --> 36:41.781
- Get me a brandy.
- Yes, sir.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.463
That's very handsome, sir.

37:05.681 --> 37:06.723
Oh...

37:09.060 --> 37:12.145
Might I introduce
my sister to you, sir?

37:12.271 --> 37:14.022
She's arrived.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.775
She's very excited
at the prospect of being with us.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.318
Oh, is she?

37:25.284 --> 37:26.534
Vera?

38:22.800 --> 38:26.678
Well, I'm absolutely certain
you'll be fascinated by Brazil.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.639
Oh, yes.

38:29.765 --> 38:33.226
I was in the Argentine, of course.
Briefly, as a girl.

38:33.352 --> 38:36.521
I most certainly found
the Argentine fascinating.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.273
It should be very interesting.

38:39.775 --> 38:42.110
Fascinating, Tony darling.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.654
How many cities
are you going to build?

38:44.780 --> 38:45.780
Three.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.409
Yes, it's quite a big development.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.620
- In the jungle?
- Not exactly in the jungle.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.581
No, sir, on the plains.

38:54.707 --> 38:58.668
Oh, but some of the jungle
will have to be cleared, won't it?

38:58.794 --> 39:01.671
Some of the jungle, yes.
A little bit.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.883
That's where the ponchos are,
of course, on the plains.

39:05.801 --> 39:06.801
Ponchos?

39:08.429 --> 39:10.221
South American cowboys.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.141
Are they called ponchos?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.395
They were in my day.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.775
Aren't they those things they wear?

39:22.568 --> 39:25.153
With a hole in the middle
for the head to go through?

39:26.572 --> 39:28.031
What do you mean?

39:29.367 --> 39:33.078
Well, you know,
hanging down in front and behind.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.455
The cowboy.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.500
They're called cloaks, dear.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.756
Oh.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.886
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

40:33.639 --> 40:38.059
- Where's Barrett?
- Um... He's...

40:38.185 --> 40:40.687
- He's gone out shopping, sir.
- Oh.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.864
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

42:42.059 --> 42:45.228
For God's sake, look at this.
That's not much good.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.689
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Pull your socks up.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.691
Come on, come on.
Give it a good brush.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.860
- If you'd like to take the jacket off.
- No, damn it. Do it on!

42:52.987 --> 42:56.781
- Would you turn around, sir?
- All right. That will have to do.

42:56.907 --> 43:00.243
We heard this morning that
our mother's ill up in Manchester.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.329
Apparently she's been asking for us.
Might be dangerous.

43:03.455 --> 43:06.749
Would you mind if we took a night off,
came back tomorrow, late?

43:07.876 --> 43:09.460
Both of you?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.462
Well, it is touch and go, sir.

43:11.589 --> 43:15.341
- Well, that's bloody inconvenient.
- I appreciate that, sir.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.468
We could leave
a cold buffet and salad.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.430
I wanted something hot.
Couldn't you make it tomorrow?

43:20.556 --> 43:22.515
Well, I suppose we could, sir.

43:22.641 --> 43:25.893
It will give us time to get organised.
Well, I'm off.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.521
There's one other thing, sir,
before you go.

43:28.647 --> 43:30.565
What is it?
Where's my cologne?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.942
- It's about Vera.
- What about her?

43:33.068 --> 43:36.070
Well, it's her skirts, sir.
They rather worry me.

43:36.196 --> 43:39.115
Her skirts?
What's the matter with them?

43:39.241 --> 43:41.993
Well, might I suggest that
they're a little short, sir?

43:43.329 --> 43:44.912
A little short?

43:46.165 --> 43:47.832
I should say so.

43:49.668 --> 43:53.254
What do you want me to do about it?
She's your sister. Tell her yourself.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.922
Where's my cologne?

43:57.926 --> 43:59.927
Don't come in. I'm naked!

44:01.221 --> 44:03.139
Er, who is it?

44:03.265 --> 44:05.975
- It's me.
- Oh, I am sorry.

44:06.101 --> 44:09.437
- I forgot to lock the door.
- I want my cologne.

44:09.563 --> 44:11.856
- Your what?
- The bottle.

44:11.982 --> 44:14.025
It's all right.
I've got a towel on now.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.818
I just want my cologne.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.532
- What, the one with your initials on?
- Yes.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.742
Oh.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.748
I am sorry, sir,
but I thought everyone was out.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.093
Do you know Vera's in my bathroom?

44:40.219 --> 44:43.513
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- She is having a bath in my bathroom.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.766
Well, I mean to say...
I mean...

44:46.892 --> 44:50.561
Well, after all,
you've got one of your own upstairs.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.022
- I'll have a word with her.
- Yes, sir.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.331
Who told you to take a bath
in his bathroom?

45:12.626 --> 45:15.086
Who said you could use his bathroom?

45:15.921 --> 45:19.549
A gentleman doesn't like a naked girl
bouncing about in his bathroom.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.300
- Didn't you tell me to?
- Quiet.

45:21.427 --> 45:24.846
- Well, didn't you?
- Me? I'd never say a thing like that.

45:25.764 --> 45:27.515
He's still outside.

45:33.188 --> 45:35.648
- Know what I'm going to do?
- What?

45:35.774 --> 45:38.776
Here, take those.
Take one of those and put them on.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.153
- These?
- Yeah.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.280
I'm going to have a bath
in his bathroom.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.824
Oh, you're terrible!

45:44.950 --> 45:47.869

Go on, draw it.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.036
Ooh.

45:49.163 --> 45:53.040
And I want that...
That all over me. Come on.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.834
Come on.
Splash it all over me.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.674
Ow, ow, ow!

46:04.428 --> 46:06.095
Oh, it's cold.

46:13.145 --> 46:15.980
Hello?

46:16.106 --> 46:18.649
- 'It's me.'
- Oh, yes, Susan.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.569
- 'Darling, I've been worried.'
- Can I ring you back?

46:21.695 --> 46:23.237
'Well, yes, but when?'

46:23.363 --> 46:26.240
- Are you at the office?
- 'Yes, but I'm just going out.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.534
'Are you in tonight?'

46:28.660 --> 46:30.787
Er, yes. Ring me then, would you?

46:30.913 --> 46:32.997
- 'All right. Bye.'
- Bye-bye.

I wondered who it was.

49:46.358 --> 49:47.984
What are you doing here?

49:49.194 --> 49:53.155
Well, I was just going to bed
and I thought I heard a noise.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.326
But you went to Manchester.

49:57.452 --> 50:00.705
I didn't feel too well at the station,

50:00.831 --> 50:03.457
so he sent me back in a taxi.

50:06.878 --> 50:08.295
He sent you back?

50:09.339 --> 50:11.716
Oh, yes. Yes.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.681
How do you feel now?

50:19.933 --> 50:23.060
Oh, I feel a bit better.

Well, shall I get you

50:37.576 --> 50:39.243
I'm glad it was you.

50:40.287 --> 50:43.539
I... thought it might
have been him coming back.

50:46.501 --> 50:51.005
- Has he gone?
- Oh, yes. Yes, he went.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.560
Well, I'm glad I'm not alone.

51:06.104 --> 51:09.690
Well, I didn't fancy being alone
by myself in this house.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.297
Can I get you anything, sir?

51:39.763 --> 51:44.558
No.

52:21.763 --> 52:23.806
Ooh, isn't it hot in here?

52:29.354 --> 52:32.106
Oh. Isn't it?

52:34.526 --> 52:36.235
So hot.

52:46.204 --> 52:47.872
Your skirt's too short.

52:49.207 --> 52:50.499
My what?

52:53.587 --> 52:56.005
But that's how all the girls
are wearing them.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.091
Well, that's how they all wear them.

53:01.553 --> 53:04.889
Why? Do you think it's too short?

53:15.233 --> 53:16.650
Are you hot?

53:57.525 --> 54:00.194
Oh, hello, Barrett?
How's your mother?

54:00.320 --> 54:03.239
- On the mend, sir.
- Oh, good. Good.

54:05.450 --> 54:09.119
- Little Vera wasn't very well, then?
- Well, no.

54:09.246 --> 54:13.207
She looked so poorly at the station,
it wasn't right to let her travel.

54:13.333 --> 54:17.294
- She hasn't been an inconvenience?
- Oh, not at all. She hasn't at all.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.838
Has she managed
to do anything for you, sir?

54:20.632 --> 54:22.675
I beg your pardon?

54:22.801 --> 54:24.927
I hope she was able
to see to your meals.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.846
Oh, yes, yes, we...
I had lunch.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.432
I notice she didn't do the washing-up.

54:30.558 --> 54:33.394
Still under the weather, I suppose.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.145
Under the what, sir?

54:36.982 --> 54:38.399
The weather.

54:39.651 --> 54:41.068
Oh, yes.

54:41.820 --> 54:45.406
Oh, Barrett, would you go
to the off-licence for me?

54:45.532 --> 54:48.367
For a quart of beer?
I've got rather a thirst.

54:48.493 --> 54:51.245
- There's plenty of beer, sir.
- Yes, I know that.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.998
But I want some plain brown ale.

54:56.459 --> 54:58.085
Right, sir. Certainly, sir.

55:13.977 --> 55:15.686
- Vera?
- Yes, sir?

55:15.812 --> 55:17.938
- Come down a minute.
- I'm coming.

55:18.064 --> 55:20.107
- Where are you?
- Down here.

55:21.568 --> 55:23.402
He's back.

55:28.908 --> 55:31.327
What are you doing?

55:31.453 --> 55:35.080
- I've got to do the washing-up.
- I've sent him out to the pub.

55:36.791 --> 55:38.917
He'll be back in a minute.

55:39.044 --> 55:41.170
Who cares about him?

55:41.296 --> 55:42.921
Well, he is your brother.

55:46.259 --> 55:48.677
What are you doing?

55:53.516 --> 55:55.434
Oh, you hurt me.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.509
Oh, hello, Barrett.

57:10.635 --> 57:12.761
Just getting a bit of air
in the garden.

57:12.887 --> 57:16.265
- Rather cold, sir.
- Got the beer? Oh, good.

57:16.391 --> 57:18.016
Anything else you want, sir?

57:18.143 --> 57:21.895
No, thanks. I'll be going out soon
but I'll be back before midnight.

57:22.021 --> 57:24.690

for you to wait up for me, though.

- I know.

wouldn't be better in a different jar.

It's difficult to say

Shall I tell you the truth, Barrett?

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.195
Yes, Miss.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:37.200
The truth is, I don't give
a tinker's gob what you think.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:46.376
I want some lunch.
A salad will do.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.462

I bought on Wednesday.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:24.998
Come here.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.220
Do you use a deodorant?

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.728
Tell me, do you think you go well
with the colour scheme?

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.359
I think the master's satisfied.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.748
What do you want from this house?

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:14.631

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.216
Yes, want.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:34.359
I'm the servant, Miss.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.279
Get my lunch.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.728
Why don't you come up to my room?

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.399
There's a wonderful view from there.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:59.110
Or what about your room?
What's it like from yours?

01:09:59.236 --> 01:10:00.945
Not very good from mine.

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.008
The best view is
from our room at the house.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.231
What about leaving tonight?

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.237
Wouldn't that seem a little rude?

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:44.155
No, no, they won't mind.

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.815
There's a light on in my room.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.067
Quarter to twelve!

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.465
Come on, now.
Give us one over.

01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:48.428
- You've only just had one.
- Well, I want another one.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:52.390
Oh, all this bloody smoking.
Well, it drives you mad.

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.561
You're driving me mad.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:12:00.940
Oh, come on.
For goodness' sake, put it down!

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.984
But I've only had one puff.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.029
Oh, come on, put it down.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:11.117
No, no, I'm worn out.
What's the matter with you?

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:15.872
I know someone
who wouldn't say no.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.374
Him? He'd be on the floor.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.376
Hey, come on.
Let me finish this fag.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:23.671
Come on,
you're like a ruddy machine. Honest!

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:26.966
I know I am but I can't help it.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.227
It's your servants.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.648
- There's someone there.
- No, there isn't.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.735
- Did you lock up?
- Of course I did.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:49.030
- What about the bolt?
- Oh, no, I didn't bolt.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.115
Oh, you bloody little idiot!

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:05.004
There's no one there.
I told you.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.966
Oh, come on, Hugo.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:11.344
You'll catch
your death of cold out there.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:39.330
I'm...

01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:46.671
Oh, what the bloody hell
are you doing?

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.533
Well, what are you going to do?

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.914
This is your house.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.629
They're in your room.

01:14:29.673 --> 01:14:31.549
In your bed.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.600
Did you know this was going on?

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.315
Barrett? Barrett!

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.858
Come down here!

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.581
I think I should see him alone.

01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:04.790
Why?

01:15:09.963 --> 01:15:11.380
Come here.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.471
I want an explanation.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.933
Might I speak to you alone,
please, sir?

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.897
Do you realise
you've committed a criminal offence?

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.108
Criminal, sir?

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.111
She's your sister, you bastard!

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.865
She's not my sister, sir.

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.244
So, if I might say so,
we're both in the same boat.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.414
He knows precisely what I mean.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.753
In any case, apart from the error
of being in your room,

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.713
I'm perfectly within my rights.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.300
Vera's my fiancée.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:02.932
What?

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.940
Vera?

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.199
Owing to this unfortunate incident,

01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:24.912
we shall have to tell
our little secret to Mr Tony.

01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:27.498
Come on. You go and tell him.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:30.418
Well, don't be shy.
Go and tell him. Go on.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.595
Hugo and I...

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:43.806
are going to be married.

01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.064
Married?

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:56.944
Well, you've done all right.
What are you worrying about?

01:16:58.071 --> 01:17:00.656
Well, you can't have it
on a plate forever, can you?

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:08.873
Oh, come on, Hugo.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:13.377

I had a bit of bad luck today.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.254
I really had a bit of bad luck.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:39.304
It'll take me a few days
to get over it, I can tell you.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.350
Eh?

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:49.690
You're right there.

Scotch, large scotch.

01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:13.255
I wanted to come round
and call on you, but...

01:24:16.676 --> 01:24:18.093
I'll tell you what, though.

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.430
I was led up the garden path.

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:26.060
I couldn't be more sorry, honest.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.522
I was besotted by her
long before I came to you.

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:33.067
I was simply besotted by her.

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:39.156
I thought she was keen on me too.
We were saving up to get married.

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.619
Her father was a brute to her, see.

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.204
I couldn't bear to see her...

01:24:47.123 --> 01:24:48.540
suffering.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.503
But I had to pay him, like.
You know, pay him to...

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:55.589
get his consent to take her away.

01:24:57.675 --> 01:25:00.010
I had to find her a home somewhere.
That's...

01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:02.596
That's why I told you
she was my sister.

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:06.016
I thought she was devoted to me.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.310
Anyway...

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:14.149
I didn't know what was going on
between you two until that night.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.818
That night I got it out of her.

01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:19.488
She never intended to marry me.

01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:22.616
And do you know
what she's done now?

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.452
Gone off with my money.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:29.331
She's living with a bookie
in Wandsworth.

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.666
Wandsworth!

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:34.253
Look...

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.131
Give me another chance, sir.

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:41.051
I was so happy there with you.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.387
It was like bliss.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.306
We can turn over the page.

01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:52.104
I'm with an old lady in Bolton Square,
ringing the bell all day long.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.189
Up and down those stairs
all day long,

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:56.400
I'm... skin and bone.

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.365
I deceived you.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.325
I played you false. I admit that.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.580
But she was to blame.

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.832
It was her fault.

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.375
She done us both.

01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:20.549
If you can find it in your heart, sir.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.929
Give me another chance.

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:59.546
- You still sitting there?
- "It's waxed so will soon wane."

01:26:59.672 --> 01:27:02.841
- Five letters.
- I haven't got time for all that.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:05.761
Well, you ask me soon enough
when you want some help.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:09.306
Look at all this muck and slime.
It makes you feel sick.

01:27:09.432 --> 01:27:12.351
Well, do something about it.
You're the bloody servant.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:15.729
And you expect me to cope
with all this muck and filth,

01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:18.899
all your leavings all over the place
without a maid, do you?

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:22.569
I need a maid to give me a hand.
I'm not used to such squalor.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:24.571
Look what I've got on my hands. You.

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:27.199
Can't expect to get any work
done in this place.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:29.493
As soon as I hoover
you're straight up it.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:33.914
- You're in everybody's way.
- Oh, why don't you leave me alone?

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.126
What's this? "It's waxed
so will wane soon." Five letters.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.671
Why don't you get a job
instead of mooning about?

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:44.091
- Oh, I can't do it.
- Here I am scraping and skimping,

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.553
trying to make ends meet,
getting worse and worse.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.390
And you're no bloody help, either.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.520
Butter's gone up tuppence a pound.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.856
As a matter of fact,
I'll be meeting a man very shortly.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.193
What man?

01:28:03.319 --> 01:28:05.279
The man from Brazil?

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.406
What's he going to do for you?

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:10.492
Come down by helicopter on the roof?
Is that it?

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:13.537
Oh, why don't you shut up?

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:27.926
Barrett?

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.486
- What's the matter with you?
- Get out of it.

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:50.449
- What are you doing?
- There's tea dregs on the carpet.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.617
- Where?
- In the drawing room.

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.661
Well, I haven't put them there.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.259
Now here you are. Use it.

01:29:10.636 --> 01:29:12.054
Don't do that to me!

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.139
- clear it up!
- Not my fault, them dregs!

01:29:14.265 --> 01:29:17.559
- Oh, you filthy bastard.
- Right, I'm leaving.

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:20.145
- That's what I want.
- Don't talk to me like that.

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:23.190
- After all I've done for you!
- Get down and clear it up.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.115
- I won't stand for this.
- Take your pigsty elsewhere.

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:34.409
- It's not my pigsty, it's yours.
- Creep!

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:37.371
- Nobody talks to me like that.
- Do you know what you are?

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.414
- You're a peasant.
- Peasant, am I?

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.875
I'll tell you what I am.

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:45.045
I'm a gentleman's gentleman
and you're no bloody gentleman.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.717
Oh, you think I'm past it?

01:29:50.843 --> 01:29:53.637
I haven't had a drink all morning.
I'm through with it.

01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:58.141
- Oh, I'll knock your head off.
- Violence will get you nowhere.

01:29:58.267 --> 01:30:01.478
If you don't wipe those dregs up
I'll ram your nose in them.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:05.774
You're funny.

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.682
I wouldn't mind going out for a walk.

01:30:47.066 --> 01:30:49.359
Must be quite nice out.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:56.867
Watch it!

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:59.619
No, out of play,
out of play, out of play.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.959
Right, got you.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.463
Bit wild.

01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:15.385
Nearly got you then, though.

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:20.015
13-10. Count it as that.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:24.394
Well, I can't do it any more.
I have to bend all the time.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:28.315
What about me? I'm in the inferior
position of playing uphill.

01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:30.025
I need a drink.

01:31:31.277 --> 01:31:34.446
That's half the point of the game,
the bending.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:37.741
You're getting as fat as a pig.
You need the exercise.

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:41.995
Right, service. 14-12.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:48.585
- That wasn't fair. I wasn't ready.
- I said "service", didn't I?

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:52.255
I'm not having that point counted.

01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:54.341
That was a perfectly fair point.

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:57.511
What about the other night?
You did about six like that.

01:31:57.637 --> 01:32:00.764
Don't take advantage.
You're sitting in the best position.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.058
You ought to play
according to the rules.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.269
You're just a little upset
because you're losing the game.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.438
Take your ball.

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:12.442
- Take it yourself.
- Ow!

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:16.655
- Well, what's the matter?
- I... I'm going.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:19.115
- It couldn't have hurt.
- Get out the way.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:23.286
I'm not staying here in a place
where they chuck balls in your face.

01:32:23.412 --> 01:32:26.122
Don't be a fool.
Come on, let's have a drop of brandy.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:28.375
Tell you what,
we'll call that game a draw.

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:30.502
- Isn't that fair?
- Push your brandy!

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:32.754
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Push you!

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.714
Get back to your coal heap.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.092
Look, Barrett,
don't you forget your place.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:39.844
You're nothing but a servant
in this house.

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.638
A servant?

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:43.473
I'm nobody's servant.

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:47.269
Who finished the whole place for you?

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:50.522
Who painted it for you?
Who does the cooking?

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:54.067
Who washes your pants?
Who cleans the bath out? I do.

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:56.653
I run the place and
what do I get out of it? Nothing.

01:32:56.779 --> 01:33:00.448
- Now, listen, Barrett...
- I know all about you, sonny.

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:03.577
I am grateful, honestly.
Don't be daft. You know I am.

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:04.744
Yeah, I believe you.

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:07.831
You know, I...
I don't know what I'd do without you.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.130
Well, then, go and pour me
a glass of brandy.

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:21.052
- Well, that's what I suggested.
- Don't just stand there. Go and do it.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:33.982
Fabulous.

01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:36.610
Yes.

01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:39.195
- It's not bad.
- It's fabulous.

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.867
It's a bit salty.

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:45.535
No, no, it's marvellous.

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.752
I don't know how you do it.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:55.629
Oh.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:58.006
It's nice to know it's appreciated.

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:03.845
It makes all the difference.

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.513
Oh, I do appreciate it.

01:34:08.517 --> 01:34:12.437
You know, sometimes I get the feeling
that we're two old pals.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.358
- That's funny.
- Why?

01:34:18.527 --> 01:34:20.362
I got the same feeling myself.

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:27.702
I've only had that same feeling
once before.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.955
Did you? When was that?

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.877
Once in the army.

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.587
Well, that's funny.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.258
I had the same feeling myself
there too.

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.179
Once.

01:34:47.598 --> 01:34:51.935
47, 48, 49 and 50.

01:34:53.604 --> 01:34:57.440
I've got a tiny feeling
that you're not downstairs at all.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.406
You're not downstairs at all.

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.577
I think you're up there.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.121
Aren't you?

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.793
And now I'm on my way to get you.

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:26.052
Where's your little lair this time?

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:34.436
Puss, puss.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:38.314
Pussy, puss, puss.

01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:40.066
Puss, puss, puss, puss.

01:35:47.366 --> 01:35:48.783
I'm getting warm.

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:54.831
You're hiding.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.084
You'll be caught.

01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:03.131
I'm getting warmer.

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:14.225
You've got a guilty secret.

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.856
But you'll be caught.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.652
I'm coming to get you.

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:31.951
I'm creeping up on you.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.497
I can smell a rat.

01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:39.667
I...

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:41.503
can...

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:42.629

01:36:44.256 --> 01:36:45.673
a...

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:48.218
rat!

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.608
- What do you want?
- To speak to him.

01:37:03.734 --> 01:37:05.902
- clear off out of it.
- I want to speak to him.

01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:07.278
Come here. Quick.

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.781
clear off!

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.791
Come on, out.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.627
- Come on.
- Look... I want... please.

01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:24.379
I'll speak to her. Leave her.

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:45.149
Listen...

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:49.654
I... I got to go to hospital.

01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.366
They're taking me in, you see.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:57.370
Give us some money.

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:00.039
please, lend me a few quid.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:04.085
Oh, go on. Well...

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.962
Just only a few.

01:38:06.088 --> 01:38:07.797
What about what you did to me?

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:12.802
It was him.

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:15.346
He made me.

01:38:19.351 --> 01:38:20.768
I loved you, though.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.236
I... I still love you.

01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:49.547
playing games
with little sis again, are we?

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:56.471
That won't get you anywhere, Tone.
Come on, little sister, out.

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.514
- Come on.
- It was him.

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:01.601
- Him. He done it. He did.
- Stinking out the place! Come on!

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:06.189
I love you.

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:07.899
- I...
- Come on!

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:12.528
Get back to your ponce.

01:39:15.658 --> 01:39:16.866

I've got something for you

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:28.146
from a little man in Jermyn Street.

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:29.564
Not for me.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:33.026
Oh, come on.
Have a sip, see what it tastes like.

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:35.737
I told you, I'm not drinking.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.322
Oh, now, look.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:41.075
Just have a little sip, that's all.

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:43.244
Just a sip. There you are.

01:41:07.269 --> 01:41:08.311
You see?

01:41:10.022 --> 01:41:13.024
I can still think of things
that will please you, can't I?

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:19.989
You won't get many
better than me, you know.

01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:23.242
What do you want?
An old hag running round the house,

01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:26.412
getting you up in the morning
at the crack of dawn,

01:41:26.538 --> 01:41:28.956
telling you what to do?

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:31.000
My only ambition is to...

01:41:32.002 --> 01:41:34.212
serve you.
You know that, don't you?

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.132
I'm sorry, I...

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:39.717
I've been a bit edgy lately.

01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:42.011
Oh, well, I mean...

01:41:42.137 --> 01:41:43.971
I mean, I...

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:47.225
I admit, I...
I make mistakes, but...

01:41:48.477 --> 01:41:50.770
Well, after all,
I'm only human, aren't I?

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:53.606
You wouldn't like me
if I wasn't human, would you?

01:41:58.487 --> 01:42:01.155
- The place could be cleaner.
- Oh, I know.

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:04.200
I know it could be a bit cleaner.

01:42:04.326 --> 01:42:06.953

I've been going on about for days.

01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:18.381
