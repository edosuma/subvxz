00:06.107 --> 00:07.377
Dear Lord...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.609
please forgive me.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.352
I was a fool.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.250
I thought You'd betrayed me,

00:17.251 --> 00:19.791
and all I could hear
was my own anger.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.763
But now I know.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.563
You have chosen me.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.066
You have a purpose for me.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.738
You said to Jeremiah,
"Call to Me,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.069
"and I will answer you,

00:40.074 --> 00:42.814
"and I will tell you
great and mighty things

00:42.815 --> 00:44.810
which you do not know."

00:47.681 --> 00:49.281
Well, here I am, God...

00:50.218 --> 00:52.818
calling to You.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.620
I am Your servant.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.325
Reveal my path to me,

00:58.326 --> 01:01.496
and I shall do
everything You demand.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.667
Your will be done.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

03:59.973 --> 04:02.309
Water's perfect. You coming?

04:02.310 --> 04:04.580
I haven't been in the pool
in five years.

04:04.581 --> 04:06.446
That's a fucking shame.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.977
People lucky enough
to have a pool

04:07.981 --> 04:10.320
should pay a fine if they
don't use it once a month.

04:10.321 --> 04:12.588
Open it to the public.
Even better.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.387
You reading the obituaries?

04:15.389 --> 04:17.219
I'm trying to see

04:17.224 --> 04:19.034
if there's going to be
a funeral for her,

04:19.035 --> 04:20.386
but I can't find it.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.528
The Natasha girl?

04:21.529 --> 04:23.659
Yeah. I should be there.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.404
Okay. Whatever gets
your ass out of the house.

04:26.405 --> 04:28.335
- Don't.
- Uch, Crys,

04:28.336 --> 04:29.866
this is just...
This is so stupid.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.908
I get that you're
spooked. So am I.

04:31.909 --> 04:33.905
But you don't know
that that cop shot her.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.174
I heard his voice.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.335
Then you call the FBI.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.650
You call the fucking DEA.

04:37.651 --> 04:39.445
Anybody with badges and guns.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.877
And say what?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.452
So you do nothing? Forever?

04:45.853 --> 04:47.186
I love you, honey,

04:47.187 --> 04:50.517
and boy, do I love hanging
out by your fucking pool.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.030
But I can't be your babysitter

04:52.031 --> 04:53.225
for the rest of your life.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.594
I told you when I got here

04:54.595 --> 04:55.895
that I could only
stay till today.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.766
Wait, wait.
Just one more day, please.

04:57.767 --> 04:58.895
Why?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.869
If you're not
going to do anything,

05:00.870 --> 05:03.068
how will tomorrow be
any different than today?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.370
If you don't trust the cops,

05:05.373 --> 05:08.013
you should at least
call Pernell.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.052
I got a letter
from our landlord today.

05:14.053 --> 05:16.115
60 day notice. Guess what.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.946
They can kiss my ass.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.387
This is our home.
This is the home of truth.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.788
You know, that's why
they don't want us here.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.389
They don't want us
to tell the truth.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.631
But because you do...
You want the truth.

05:24.632 --> 05:25.855
- Paul...
- You need to know...

05:25.859 --> 05:27.897
Alicia, I... I just
wrinkled up the letter.

05:27.898 --> 05:29.395
I have one chance
to do it fresh.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.557
Okay. You need to see this.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.734
You need to see this.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.989
I already called the cops.

05:56.990 --> 05:57.990
Thanks.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.291
Just ask him to leave.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.592
If he refuses,

06:00.594 --> 06:01.994
don't push it.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.455
Just wait for the cops.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.472
Actually, Holly,
I'll talk to him.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.445
There he is, the skeptic.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.506
You still mad at God?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.215
Here I am.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.484
Take it out on me.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.085
I don't want to fight.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.287
Why are you in our chapel?

06:28.288 --> 06:30.088
We worship God here.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.824
We've been found.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.255
So have I.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.900
I believe.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.469
We don't want you here.

06:40.470 --> 06:43.598
Why not? Aren't all
believers welcome?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.271
You don't believe.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.474
Yes, I do. I'm anointed.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.775
No. You need help.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.983
This is why I'm here.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.654
God is sending me messages
through this pen.

06:59.655 --> 07:02.663
I would like for you
to help me understand it.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.685
All right, you might
think you're anointed.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.204
You're not going
to get my help again.

07:08.205 --> 07:11.025
I am telling you that everything
you told me was right.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.071
- I see that now.
- You hurt people.

07:13.072 --> 07:15.766
Bad people who I never
would have found

07:15.769 --> 07:18.369
without God's guidance
and your help.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.839
A few days ago,
you wanted to kill me

07:19.840 --> 07:21.508
because you didn't
think there was a God.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.379
And now you're back
to thinking you're anointed?

07:23.380 --> 07:24.776
When did that change?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.048
When I realized that God
kept His promise.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.520
You remember Tessie?

07:31.521 --> 07:32.619
Yeah, your call girl.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.187
My wife. She's pregnant.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.256
It's a boy.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.526
My boy.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.987
Your hooker wife is pregnant,

07:40.994 --> 07:42.904
and you think that
makes you anointed?

07:42.905 --> 07:45.264
God didn't give PJ back to me,

07:45.265 --> 07:46.895
but he did give me a son.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.368
He answered me.

07:49.369 --> 07:53.669
Just... not in the way
that I expected.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.775
I'm glad you believe again.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.748
I truly hope you can
walk your path

07:59.749 --> 08:01.077
with Jesus by your side,

08:01.081 --> 08:02.951
but this is not
the church for you.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.558
Who's the nonbeliever now?

09:00.407 --> 09:01.707
You okay, Judge Harris?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.609
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.649
You know what it's like...

09:10.618 --> 09:11.987
I saw this video one time

09:11.988 --> 09:13.985
where this deaf kid
got an operation

09:13.987 --> 09:16.087
so he could hear
for the first time.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.789
These cochlear implants
they got.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.728
Anyway, after the operation,

09:21.729 --> 09:23.299
they set him down at this table,

09:23.300 --> 09:25.264
and, and they tapped one,

09:25.265 --> 09:27.465
but they haven't turned
the thing on yet,

09:27.467 --> 09:29.137
so he doesn't hear anything.

09:29.138 --> 09:33.166
And then they turn on
the device, and they tap...

09:33.173 --> 09:34.643
and the kid...

09:35.643 --> 09:37.313
he starts bawling.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.652
That's all it took...
A little tap.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.184
That's how I feel, Keith.

09:45.185 --> 09:49.555
Like I've been going
through life with no sound,

09:49.556 --> 09:51.886
and now everything I hear
is a miracle.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.894
That's how it is for me,
too, Judge Harris.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.725
When I first met you
in that courtroom,

09:57.731 --> 10:00.671
it was like somebody
tapped on the table.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.037
You've been right all along.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.938
I'm so sorry I made you wait.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.914
But if we hope
for what we do not see,

10:14.915 --> 10:16.945
we wait with patience.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.052
Well...

10:21.188 --> 10:22.955
the waiting's over.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.356
We're going to put an end
to this fucking trial.

10:28.095 --> 10:31.055
Shane Caldwell's wife
said that there's a video

10:31.064 --> 10:33.465
that I would pay good money for.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.866
Does she have it?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.235
I don't think so,

10:36.236 --> 10:39.005
but she definitely
knows what's on it.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.706
I want to start there.
Bring her to me.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.176
Yes, sir.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.907
She's not going to come
by choice.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.926
Not the same old
steakhouse here, right?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.797
Every once in a while, you got
to change up the rhythm.

11:01.798 --> 11:04.025
Half the kitchen staff here
is from El Salvador.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.731
This is what they cook
for themselves.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.033
I thought so.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.940
There's pepperoni
in this papusa.

11:08.941 --> 11:11.466
Yeah, these guys
pick up some new flavors

11:11.471 --> 11:12.971
from el norte.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.543
You want to get
some slaw on that.

11:14.544 --> 11:15.841
It's good stuff.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.643
You ever been to El Salvador?
Beautiful.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.650
You should take your lady
there some time.

11:19.651 --> 11:20.976
Or your man or whatever.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.219
Just go for yourself.
What the hell.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.916
Went down there
for my third honeymoon.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.748
If I'm smart, it's my last.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.586
You ever been married?

11:30.590 --> 11:31.657
No.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.888
Yeah.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.828
Mach dot This,
eHookUp, whatever.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.459
Everyone keeps asking
like it's so hard

11:37.464 --> 11:38.802
to get into a relationship.

11:38.803 --> 11:40.899
It ain't half as hard
as getting out of one.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.201
You know what I mean?

11:46.339 --> 11:47.779
I was wondering
when we'd get around

11:47.780 --> 11:48.935
to having this conversation.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.479
- Two more beers.
- At once.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.022
Go ahead.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.818
Okay.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.386
San Vicente politics

12:00.387 --> 12:03.787
have run on Harris family
money for forever.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.091
It's a bad relationship,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.161
which gives you
a real opportunity here...

12:07.162 --> 12:10.060
A chance to turn being the
biggest employer in San Vicente

12:10.063 --> 12:11.803
to being a political force.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.000
But there are going
to be some people

12:14.001 --> 12:15.201
you need to have on your side.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.902
People you could persuade?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.471
A lot of them are more loyal

12:19.472 --> 12:21.812
to the Harris family money
than they are to Pernell.

12:24.011 --> 12:27.146
You know anything about
Africanized honeybees?

12:27.147 --> 12:30.047
Word is they have
extra-big stingers.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.480
That's probably a myth.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.857
What they have is a uniquely
political behavior,

12:37.858 --> 12:39.588
even for social insects.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.930
When they find another hive,

12:40.931 --> 12:42.697
they send a few workers over.

12:42.698 --> 12:43.895
They cling to the hive,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.666
make themselves known
to the local bees,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.095
communicate, share food.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.238
So when an African queen
shows up to take over,

12:49.239 --> 12:51.336
they welcome her
as one of their own.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.868
Here we are.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.606
I paid for two clinics,

12:54.607 --> 12:55.975
a park,

12:55.976 --> 12:58.276
a quarter of the REAL
Initiative so far.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.508
Yes, you have.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.378
Senior elections are coming up,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.252
and there's going to be
campaigns to fund.

13:04.253 --> 13:05.920
You get the right
friends in line,

13:05.921 --> 13:08.389
it's going to take bigger
moves and deeper pockets.

13:08.390 --> 13:11.188
What if I fully funded
the REAL Initiative myself?

13:12.659 --> 13:13.889
No Harris money.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.134
No fundraisers,
that sort of move?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.596
Well, yeah.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.538
That would make an impression.

13:22.539 --> 13:23.865
You understand that once

13:23.871 --> 13:25.641
the process of taking over
a hive begins,

13:25.642 --> 13:27.438
it can become chaotic.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.678
There can be no order

13:28.679 --> 13:30.705
until the new power
structure's in place.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.510
Like humans, like bees, right?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.745
Not really.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.176
Humans sometimes tolerate
multiple loyalties,

13:36.183 --> 13:38.353
but a hive can
only have one queen.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.156
Then I say viva la fucking bees.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.632
Here we are, sir.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.499
Wine list and menu.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.266
Both Boss Hogs. Thanks.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.518
- It's proper.
- No.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.849
Kaplan couldn't
fucking believe it,

15:21.854 --> 15:23.492
but the judge sustained it.

15:23.493 --> 15:24.990
He says if the dog
is in the will,

15:24.992 --> 15:26.662
it has standing to contest.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.271
His face goes all red!

15:38.305 --> 15:41.435
Hey, let's get
out of here, okay?

15:56.023 --> 15:57.223
Ahem.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.556
Caldwell's wife is gone.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.529
Gone shopping or gone gone?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.699
Clothes missing,
the flowers are dead,

16:05.700 --> 16:07.128
and the milk's gone sour.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.044
Seems like she left in a hurry.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.268
Maybe somebody made her leave.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.043
Didn't want her talking to me.

16:15.044 --> 16:17.176
I took some mail and stuff.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.345
Should help us track her down.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.906
If she's traveling with a kid,

16:20.913 --> 16:22.083
it's going to make it easier.

16:22.084 --> 16:24.322
She's got a sister in Ukiah.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.058
Well, that day may come,
but it's not today.

16:29.789 --> 16:33.059
God gave me the meaning
of another one of my visions.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.490
What was it?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.526
You know Proverbs 25:19?

16:40.167 --> 16:43.197
Yeah. Something about teeth?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.144
That's the one.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.210
I can call another vote for
the Harris High name change,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.411
but it won't matter.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.882
It's still going to be 4-3

16:53.883 --> 16:55.580
in Pernell Harris' favor.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.782
Why poke the bear?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.089
Do you hear yourself?

16:58.090 --> 16:59.315
You're basically saying

16:59.319 --> 17:01.087
that you're more afraid
of Pernell Harris

17:01.088 --> 17:02.288
than of Robert Boston,
and that's okay.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.819
I don't want you
to be scared of me.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.992
I want you to believe in me.

17:04.992 --> 17:06.529
I'm at the top of my game,

17:06.530 --> 17:08.455
and next year I'll be
re-elected in a cakewalk,

17:08.461 --> 17:10.531
and he will be on trial
for murder. See what I mean?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.400
You know I love you, Robert,

17:12.401 --> 17:13.999
but my position
is not appointed.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.438
I have to run, just like you,

17:15.439 --> 17:17.335
and the Harris family
is my biggest donor,

17:17.337 --> 17:18.936
by far, every election.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.538
You don't need them
anymore, Gloria.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.374
You got name recognition now.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.105
- How do you think I got that?
- Gloria, stop.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.248
I need you to trust me.

17:25.249 --> 17:26.875
Put the vote back on the agenda

17:26.878 --> 17:28.114
for next week.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.915
Thank you.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.576
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.358
Looks like Pernell
RSVP'd to your party.

17:35.359 --> 17:37.315
- You're kidding me.
- Plus one,

17:37.324 --> 17:38.864
which I have no idea
who that could be

17:38.865 --> 17:40.858
because Crystal already
RSVP'd last week solo.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.960
He's not coming to my party.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.831
So you invite
your three ex-wives

17:43.832 --> 17:44.900
but not your bestie?

17:44.901 --> 17:46.227
Yes.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.471
Once he becomes my
ex-friend long enough,

17:48.472 --> 17:50.768
then he'll get invited again.
But not this year.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.638
Okay. I'll send an email.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.039
No. No. You deliver
that message in person.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.308
Me?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.649
Yes. You should be afraid of me.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.147
- Um...
- I'll do it, Pops.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.350
I'll have Cam drive me.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.288
Crys?

18:11.724 --> 18:12.724
Honey...

18:14.594 --> 18:15.994
I got to go.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.495
I want to get home before dark.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.327
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.332
The ME's report.
It's just... It's bullshit.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.640
What's wrong with it?

18:22.641 --> 18:25.235
It says that she was shot
during a drug deal.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.038
They found a pipe in a bag

18:27.039 --> 18:30.176
and empty meth phials
everywhere.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.507
Well, maybe she was
a part-time user.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.180
She wasn't a tweaker.
She was a hacker.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.681
She was a brilliant one.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.622
PJ got high, didn't he? You do.

18:37.623 --> 18:39.517
I was on the phone with her.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.387
She was not buying drugs.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.357
Guy next door was.
Wrong place wrong time.

18:43.358 --> 18:45.016
That is not what happened!

18:45.024 --> 18:47.693
This is just... It's a cover-up.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.927
Jesus Christ.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.498
What the fuck are you doing?

18:50.499 --> 18:51.927
I'm trying to make this right.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.900
Are you? Or are you trying
to make yourself feel better

18:54.901 --> 18:56.201
because you fucked up?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.205
You didn't kill her.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.566
She'd be alive today

19:00.573 --> 19:02.241
if I didn't talk her into going.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.542
Crys, you can't control
everything!

19:03.543 --> 19:05.112
And I know that's
what you like to do.

19:05.113 --> 19:06.211
You've always done that,

19:06.213 --> 19:07.453
and it's gotten you really far

19:07.454 --> 19:08.616
from where you started.

19:08.617 --> 19:10.215
But you are drinking
your own Kool-Aid

19:10.217 --> 19:11.617
if you think you've
ever been in charge.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.686
Shit happens.
Life is gonna fuck you.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.587
You have nothing to do with it.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.229
She didn't deserve
to die like that.

19:18.230 --> 19:19.255
She was a...

19:19.259 --> 19:21.929
She was a fucking kid.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.860
Just like PJ?

19:26.233 --> 19:27.833
Is that what this is?

19:29.969 --> 19:32.569
Bright kids are going
to go where they go.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.072
They're going to do
what they do.

19:34.073 --> 19:37.243
They're going to love
who they love, and...

19:38.545 --> 19:40.375
we don't get to choose.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.591
I'll call you when I get home.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.803
Come in.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.671
Hey. Asa.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.073
How you doing, Pernell?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.107
Great.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.378
My dad is not coming.

20:10.379 --> 20:13.545
Have a seat.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.214
Nah. This isn't gonna take long.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.675
He doesn't want you
at his party.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.824
If you show up, they'll
stop you at the door.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.719
They'll s...

20:24.724 --> 20:27.030
I haven't missed one of
your father's birthday parties

20:27.031 --> 20:28.326
in 20-something years.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.098
Might be time to start
a new tradition, right?

20:31.099 --> 20:32.566
I know I fucked up, but, I mean,

20:32.567 --> 20:34.095
how am I going to make it right

20:34.100 --> 20:35.369
if I can't talk to him?

20:35.370 --> 20:36.737
Every time you do talk to him,

20:36.738 --> 20:38.436
you make something else wrong.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.006
Listen, Pernell,

20:41.007 --> 20:42.437
it's just not a good time.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.182
He wants to regain some
control over his life,

20:45.183 --> 20:47.407
make his own decisions.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.846
If they can't track us,

20:51.851 --> 20:53.891
they can't control us, you know?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.185
What do you mean by that?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.957
PJ said that in a video.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.327
You heard it before, right?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.928
Maybe. I don't remember.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.630
What's that have to do with
your old man's birthday party?

21:07.634 --> 21:10.204
Nothing. I just figured
you'd heard it.

21:10.205 --> 21:13.639
Look, just steer clear
tomorrow night, all right?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.340
There's been enough static.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.053
There's things
he needs to know, Asa.

21:19.054 --> 21:21.375
So tell me.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.587
I'll tell him.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.890
Nah. This is just for him.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.364
Did you post it?

21:38.365 --> 21:42.065
Not yet. I don't know
if I want to.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.598
Why not?

21:43.603 --> 21:46.472
I mean, that guy who beat
your ass a week ago

21:46.473 --> 21:48.579
was here begging
for forgiveness.

21:48.580 --> 21:51.105
I'd think our followers
would eat that up.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.778
What if he's right?

21:52.779 --> 21:53.945
About what?

21:53.946 --> 21:56.046
Being chosen.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.116
He's crazy.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.885
Don't let him suck you in.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.846
Whatever money he might give us,

22:01.854 --> 22:03.292
it's not worth the trouble.

22:03.293 --> 22:04.958
I'm not thinking
about the money.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.087
Paul, he's a murderer.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.992
Why are we even having
this conversation?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.400
Why did God choose Saul,

22:09.401 --> 22:11.156
a man who killed
hundreds of Christians,

22:11.163 --> 22:12.501
to become His apostle?

22:12.502 --> 22:14.699
Why did Jesus choose
Mary Magdalene, a whore,

22:14.701 --> 22:15.901
to be His travel companion?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.540
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying

22:17.541 --> 22:19.437
that God's ways are mysterious...

22:19.439 --> 22:20.569
Sometimes.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.943
But Pernell's aren't.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.979
I don't care if he
starts walking on water.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.577
I don't want him here.
He's dangerous.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.276
Sorry I called you so late.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.777
What's going on, Crys?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.247
If I let you come back,

23:02.248 --> 23:04.218
you okay with the guest room?

23:04.219 --> 23:06.786
I fucking love the guest room.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.903
A knife?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.026
Why do you have that?

23:23.736 --> 23:24.766
Crystal.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.043
What the fuck's going on?

23:33.513 --> 23:35.013
Wilson's dead.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.214
What?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.815
She went to that meeting.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.117
He shot her.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.488
Who shot her?

23:41.854 --> 23:43.088
Chief Clay.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.819
Toby?

23:50.396 --> 23:51.556
Hey.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.500
Hey.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.169
Hey. Come here.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.367
Come here, come here, come here.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.584
Come here.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.157
Were you there?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.659
So how do you know it was Toby?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
I heard his voice.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.026
I was on the phone with her.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.900
I heard everything.

24:28.901 --> 24:34.711
Now I feel like he's always
right outside the door...

24:36.408 --> 24:38.338
and he's waiting for me,

24:38.344 --> 24:39.882
and I don't know what to do.

24:39.883 --> 24:42.748
First thing you're gonna
do is get some sleep.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.116
There's nobody
outside that door.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.547
Nobody's going to hurt you,
not while I'm here.

24:49.355 --> 24:52.555
We're going to figure all
this shit out in the morning.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.263
Thank you.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.702
You got a little more junk
in your trunk these days.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.713
Been a busy month.
Here. This one.

25:38.714 --> 25:41.505
Are you sure about that?

25:41.507 --> 25:42.737
I don't give a fuck, Fortune.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.042
They all look good.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.944
Okay.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.875
Make my job a little easier.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.180
Now, maybe next time,

25:49.181 --> 25:51.717
I'll just have a suit
off the rack

25:51.718 --> 25:53.048
from Macy's.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.722
Hey, look, I didn't
mean it like that.

25:54.723 --> 25:56.191
You know. Come on.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.357
What do you think?

25:59.358 --> 26:00.988
Nice.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.929
Want to talk to me
about the Valco tract?

26:04.931 --> 26:06.164
No.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.365
Want me to talk to you
about the Valco tract?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.867
We're done here, Fortune.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.011
I just need my box.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.253
Bobo, you're playing
games with yourself.

26:23.254 --> 26:24.549
You told me

26:24.550 --> 26:26.650
that the Shane Caldwell
connection meant nothing.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.793
That Valco order was going
to be signed, no matter what.

26:28.794 --> 26:30.188
It won't look that way.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.489
Do you honestly think
that I'm the only person

26:32.491 --> 26:34.091
that knows how
to connect the dots?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.833
There aren't any dots
to connect.

26:35.834 --> 26:37.528
Really? There's no dots?

26:37.529 --> 26:40.498
Well, let me tell you
what I found in two days.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.429
Shane Caldwell... dot.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.073
Eminent domain order
for the Valco tract... dot.

26:45.074 --> 26:46.940
Holding companies that own land

26:46.941 --> 26:49.139
around the Brooks
development... dot,

26:49.141 --> 26:51.041
two of which I've already
been able to connect

26:51.043 --> 26:53.044
to the Harris Family Trust...

26:53.045 --> 26:54.875
Dot dot.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.881
And the value of the land
has tripled

26:56.883 --> 26:58.453
since construction started...

26:58.454 --> 27:01.750
- Dot-dot-dot.
- Dot-dot-dot-goose. I get it.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.192
You're so good at what you do.

27:03.193 --> 27:05.259
Now I understand why you
didn't want to testify.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.756
I didn't do anything illegal.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.861
Don't aim too high now.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.698
Are you serious?

27:12.699 --> 27:14.199
Yes, I'm serious.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.368
You think I'm any different
than any other politician?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.369
I used to.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.937
Izzy, you been
around long enough.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.882
You know what it is.
I don't make the rules.

27:24.883 --> 27:26.707
The Brooks Innovation deal

27:26.713 --> 27:29.751
is changing the course
of history in this city.

27:29.752 --> 27:31.819
And it was hanging on
by a thread.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.118
So I had to make Pernell
happy to get the deal done.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.854
- That's it.
- But blaming Pernell

27:35.855 --> 27:37.715
is not going to make you
look any better, Bobo.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.624
Of course not.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.155
But it is his fault,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.230
the reason why
I'm in this position.

27:44.731 --> 27:45.931
That you're looking at me

27:45.932 --> 27:47.432
with disappointment
in your eyes.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.301
I...

27:51.871 --> 27:53.171
I got Brooks Innovation

27:53.172 --> 27:54.942
setting up shop in my city.

27:54.943 --> 27:57.341
I'm launching a $40 million
education initiative.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.512
I've got 500 people
coming to my birthday party

27:59.513 --> 28:01.281
thinking I'm
the toast of the town.

28:01.282 --> 28:03.550
But the truth
of the matter is what?

28:03.551 --> 28:04.879
I'm one trial away

28:04.884 --> 28:07.454
from my whole legacy
going up in smoke.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.786
And that's his fault.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.088
That's his fault.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.057
See what I mean?

28:45.691 --> 28:46.958
Crys,

28:46.959 --> 28:49.329
you do realize
that Toby doesn't know

28:49.330 --> 28:50.928
that you know
he killed Wilson, right?

28:50.930 --> 28:52.660
You don't know what he knows.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.800
I know he knows where you live.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.001
And I know he has dozens
of plausible reasons

28:57.003 --> 28:59.613
for his guys to storm
in here and start shooting

28:59.614 --> 29:02.005
and you end up
accidentally dead.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.478
But that hasn't happened,
and he's had days.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.246
Yeah.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.445
Yeah, I guess.

29:15.554 --> 29:16.554
So what is it?

29:21.127 --> 29:24.195
I called her this morning.

29:24.196 --> 29:29.136
Wilson's... Natasha's mother.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.138
Aw, shit.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.907
I told her what
happened to Natasha

29:35.908 --> 29:37.208
wasn't her fault.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.439
No, it wasn't.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.054
And I told her that...

29:41.513 --> 29:42.881
the bag was mine

29:42.882 --> 29:46.852
and I made her
score drugs for me.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.619
Jesus.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.390
Why would you do that, Crys?

29:50.391 --> 29:53.458
Because maybe I can't
control everything.

29:53.459 --> 29:57.059
But Toby Clay put a bullet
in her little girl's throat,

29:57.063 --> 30:00.303
and that woman deserves
somebody to hate.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.941
Maybe hate's
not the right answer.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.135
Sometimes it's all
a mother has left.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.087
Dear Lord, please lead him

30:23.089 --> 30:24.958
to speak with truth
and enlightenment

30:24.959 --> 30:27.487
so that we may find the
next step in our path.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.033
- Amen.
- Amen.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.830
So this neurologist
that I was seeing...

30:35.968 --> 30:38.198
he said that the brain,
under stress...

30:39.171 --> 30:41.241
can have these episodes.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.108
It may seem like hallucinations,

30:44.110 --> 30:47.078
but, um, it's really
the brain in overdrive

30:47.079 --> 30:48.309
making these connections

30:48.314 --> 30:49.883
that you would never
see otherwise.

30:49.884 --> 30:51.552
You think that's possible?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.819
I mean, it's plausible, right?

30:54.820 --> 30:57.620
So this thing that's
been bugging me,

30:57.623 --> 31:02.127
I kept having these visions
of your teeth falling out,

31:02.128 --> 31:04.996
and I couldn't figure it out.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.767
And then I saw you yesterday,
and it hit me.

31:07.768 --> 31:09.696
You know your Bible, Adam?

31:09.701 --> 31:12.070
Proverbs 25:19?

31:12.071 --> 31:15.240
Relying on a treacherous
man in time of trouble

31:15.241 --> 31:17.941
is like chewing
with a broken tooth.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.114
A treacherous man.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.317
That's you, Adam.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.985
Lose the gag.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.157
You can talk now

31:32.158 --> 31:34.688
if you want. It's what
you're good at, isn't it?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.094
You're out of your mind

31:36.095 --> 31:37.555
if you think you can
get away with this.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.733
Chances are I'm getting
a lethal injection,

31:39.734 --> 31:42.031
so you don't think I give a fuck

31:42.034 --> 31:43.474
what I can get away
with, do you?

31:43.475 --> 31:47.805
You, on the other hand,
should be very concerned

31:47.806 --> 31:49.136
because you're on trial, too,

31:49.141 --> 31:50.976
and I'm the judge,

31:50.977 --> 31:54.077
so bang-bang-bang,
court's in session.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.620
First and only witness,
Mr. Adam Regis.

31:58.850 --> 31:59.850
Help!

32:01.087 --> 32:03.017
Nope. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.555
Careful, Adam.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.586
My bailiff is very enthusiastic.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.062
How did they get you
to sell me out?

32:12.064 --> 32:13.898
Did they pay you?

32:13.899 --> 32:15.899
Or was it as easy
as just asking?

32:15.901 --> 32:18.636
I... I didn't do anything.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.767
Aah! Aah!

32:23.409 --> 32:24.839
Perjury is a very
serious offense

32:24.843 --> 32:27.245
in this courtroom, Mr. Regis.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.646
Please. I didn't.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.254
Adam, Adam.

32:36.488 --> 32:40.558
When I went to see
that doctor in San Francisco,

32:40.559 --> 32:43.197
they got a photo of me
on the Bay Bridge.

32:43.198 --> 32:45.725
They knew exactly where
I was going to be,

32:45.731 --> 32:47.169
when I was going to be there,

32:47.170 --> 32:49.436
and only one other
motherfucker on this planet

32:49.437 --> 32:52.065
knew that information,
so please cut the shit.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.543
Or maybe we could put
your mother on the stand.

32:55.544 --> 32:57.941
I mean, Keith can find her
anywhere any time.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.777
No, I didn't...

32:59.778 --> 33:01.078
So who did you report to?

33:01.080 --> 33:04.849
Was it McCauley? Toby?

33:04.850 --> 33:06.520
Or both?

33:09.388 --> 33:12.058
Toby! To-Toby! Just Toby!

33:12.958 --> 33:15.458
Good.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.361
Now, you see how easy that was?

33:20.066 --> 33:21.266
By the way,

33:21.267 --> 33:23.667
you're still fucking guilty.

33:23.669 --> 33:24.699
Please.

33:24.703 --> 33:25.836
- So...
- Please.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.167
Let's talk about restitution.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.640
W-What do you mean?

33:29.641 --> 33:31.511
Well, there's a reason
why my friend

33:31.512 --> 33:33.610
left your pretty face untouched.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.352
Something you're going
to do for me, Adam.

33:35.353 --> 33:37.515
Or we could go the other way.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.876
What other way?

33:38.884 --> 33:41.786
No. No, please. Please.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.087
Death...

33:44.923 --> 33:46.263
or restitution.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.022
Here we go. No more bets.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.525
Thanks for your vote.
Glad you could make it.

34:26.532 --> 34:27.532
I appreciate it.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.339
Come on, everybody.
Have a good time.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.665
The drinks are free.

34:30.668 --> 34:31.969
Ooh. Sorry.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.036
Yeah. This way.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.208
Smile.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.907
Shit.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.150
Look, honey. Look at me.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.886
You're safe. I promise.
Just smile.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.257
You'll be fine.

34:55.726 --> 34:56.757
Hey!

34:56.762 --> 34:58.962
Good evening,
Mrs. Harris, judge.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.402
Can you hold on a moment?

35:00.403 --> 35:03.029
Hey, Asa. Boy, you're
looking good tonight.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.572
Pernell,
what are you doing here?

35:04.573 --> 35:06.170
This is not part
of our agreement.

35:06.172 --> 35:10.341
I'm not taking my wife
through the kitchen, Ace.

35:10.342 --> 35:13.182
Fine. Fuck. Whatever. Let's go.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.215
I'll go get myself a drink.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.676
Or three.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.886
Come on, Pernell.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.030
You having a good time?

35:33.031 --> 35:34.371
Go get whatever you want.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.574
If she'd have known

35:43.575 --> 35:45.335
I'd be balling
like this one day,

35:45.344 --> 35:48.014
she'd have had a little
more patience with me.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.383
How long since you're divorced?

35:50.482 --> 35:52.917
11 years now.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.488
And you're still concerned
with what she thinks?

35:55.489 --> 35:57.056
Well, that's not
why I invited her.

35:57.057 --> 35:59.524
This is to remind her
she fucked up. Ha ha.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.825
Hey, Mr. Brooks, sorry.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.227
I need him a minute.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.529
Okay.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.538
What's up?

36:10.539 --> 36:11.966
He came.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.704
- Who?
- Pernell.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.235
Come on, Ace.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.241
Pops, you would really rather

36:17.243 --> 36:19.249
spend your birthday
with Nathan Brooks?

36:19.250 --> 36:20.805
That's supposed to be my choice.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.848
Look, you know how
sentimental he can be.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.949
Just give him a few minutes.
Maybe he'll go home.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.085
Well, shit.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.787
I knew it.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.257
Where is he?

36:33.259 --> 36:34.689
I put him in the pool room.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.831
It's the billiard room,
not the pool room.

36:36.832 --> 36:40.398
So do you play billiards in
there, or do you shoot pool?

36:41.333 --> 36:42.433
You know what?

36:42.434 --> 36:43.742
I need another drink
for this one.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.335
Go tell him I'll be
there in ten minutes.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.467
All right.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.282
Mrs. Harris.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.451
Jesus. You all right?

36:57.452 --> 36:59.079
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.494
No, no, you're not.
You're bleeding.

37:00.495 --> 37:02.286
Can I get a first aid
kit here, please?

37:02.288 --> 37:03.657
I should just go
to the bathroom.

37:03.658 --> 37:05.015
There's a shard in there.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.160
You don't need any stitches,

37:06.161 --> 37:07.427
but you're bleeding a lot.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.729
It's because
your heart is racing.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.960
Try taking some deep breaths.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.033
Not so good with blood?

37:16.034 --> 37:17.404
I think I should go to the ER.

37:17.405 --> 37:18.843
Shh. Hold on.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.314
There.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.149
You got blood on your hand.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.850
Here we are, Mrs. Harris.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.692
I'll take care of this
in no time.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.098
I don't suppose you want
to shoot a rack.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.500
If anything gets shot in here,
it's going to be you.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.414
You were asked not to come.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.641
Got you a present.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.044
What is it, a horse's head?

38:00.045 --> 38:02.345
I mean, it's your birthday,
motherfucker.

38:02.348 --> 38:04.578
Can you please just lighten up?

38:04.583 --> 38:05.983
My son said you wanted to talk.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.454
We've been talking.
You done yet?

38:13.224 --> 38:14.694
Remember that time...

38:16.662 --> 38:18.696
Ida stepped out on Papa Gene?

38:18.697 --> 38:20.697
Look, if you came here
to talk shit about my mother,

38:20.699 --> 38:22.199
I will put my foot up your ass.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.470
What was the name
of that motherfucker

38:23.471 --> 38:25.499
she went out with?
Weird little dude.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.773
He's got a beard
under here, some shit.

38:28.774 --> 38:29.774
Marion Townsend.

38:29.775 --> 38:30.735
Marion Townsend.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.482
Yeah. I never did understand

38:32.483 --> 38:35.408
what she saw in him.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.120
It was the Mercedes
that caught her eye.

38:37.121 --> 38:39.745
A janitor's wife don't get
that kind of ride at home.

38:39.751 --> 38:43.120
Right. Yeah, yeah. That's right.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.921
Yeah, I remember

38:44.923 --> 38:47.761
after Papa Gene popped him
across the face,

38:47.762 --> 38:49.859
he ripped that hood
ornament off his car.

38:49.861 --> 38:50.861
He brought it home.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.732
He put it back on his Caprice.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.395
What did he call it? The...

38:56.402 --> 38:57.272
The Merchevy.

38:57.273 --> 38:58.398
The Merchevy, yeah.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.136
Yeah.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.474
Yeah.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.605
He kept swapping that thing
from car to car

39:05.611 --> 39:07.745
until my mother passed.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.446
She never stepped out
on him again, though.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.493
I mean, you know, things
went south for a little while,

39:14.494 --> 39:16.186
but they made it right.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.155
You know.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.926
She stuck with him...

39:21.226 --> 39:22.786
till she died.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.831
I'm tired of you and me
playing games, Pernell.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.601
Let me ask you a question.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.672
You really think it was
some symbolic gesture

39:32.673 --> 39:34.539
that kept my folks together?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.140
I do think symbols matter.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.142
Get you started, maybe.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.779
Get you a night, maybe a week.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.650
But things add up over time,

39:43.651 --> 39:45.979
and it takes more than
symbols to get past it all.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.453
What got my folks through
another couple of decades

39:48.454 --> 39:50.054
was honesty.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.715
Really?

39:51.723 --> 39:53.558
Honesty about what?

39:53.559 --> 39:55.029
Everything, my man.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.467
Whatever you want to know...

40:02.468 --> 40:04.468
just ask.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.475
What happened to Shane?

40:44.843 --> 40:46.583
What's the matter,
you don't gamble?

40:46.584 --> 40:49.078
My stomach's bothering me.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.715
Too much rich food.

40:50.716 --> 40:52.476
Too much Pernell.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.486
What's the hottest girl
at the party doing

41:00.492 --> 41:02.560
hanging out all by herself?

41:02.561 --> 41:04.061
Nursing my wound.

41:05.263 --> 41:06.933
Holy shit. What happened?

41:06.934 --> 41:08.065
Broke a glass.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.736
Guess who insisted
on administering first aid.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.384
Pernell tried
to apologize to me.

41:18.385 --> 41:19.776
That's great.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.578
See if you can spin that
into something more.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.980
Toby, there's a video.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.180
Of what?

41:26.184 --> 41:27.552
I don't know,

41:27.553 --> 41:29.253
but he thinks it's
going to get him off.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.890
I'm going to deal with Toby.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.563
No. Now is not the time
to go in hot.

41:38.564 --> 41:42.104
Did it ever occur to you
that I just might have a plan?

41:44.069 --> 41:46.139
Why don't I get the driver
to take you home?

41:46.140 --> 41:48.967
No. I'm staying.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.644
He can't hurt me here. Fuck him.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.584
All right. See you at home.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.185
Gorgeous.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.365
Hey.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.407
You okay?

42:23.408 --> 42:25.638
Come on. Let's cut the cake.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.086
Fireworks.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.864
I've never been to
a party with fireworks.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.044
There he is.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.139
Thank you, thank you.

43:26.140 --> 43:27.537
You've got great singing voices.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.338
Thank you so much. Um...

43:29.340 --> 43:30.808
You know what?

43:30.809 --> 43:33.577
All year long,
you all have to listen

43:33.578 --> 43:35.108
to me make speeches and go off

43:35.113 --> 43:37.123
about whatever the hell is
so important on that day.

43:37.124 --> 43:38.815
So tonight

43:38.817 --> 43:40.147
I'm going to give
you all a present:

43:40.151 --> 43:43.420
No speeches.

43:43.421 --> 43:44.521
You like that.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.022
You like that one, yeah.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.294
No, seriously,
thank you all for coming,

43:48.295 --> 43:49.703
and, um...

43:53.264 --> 43:56.804
here's hoping we can do this
again 48 years from now.

43:56.805 --> 43:58.836
Thank you.

43:58.837 --> 44:01.007
Can we get the fire
department here?

44:01.008 --> 44:02.706
Because this is...
This is dangerous.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.208
You know what?
I got my team here.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.439
We'll take care of it.

44:05.443 --> 44:06.913
Be careful what you wish for.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.278
Let's bring it in.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.420
Cut the cake!

44:19.725 --> 44:21.985
Enjoy the party.
Enjoy the party.

44:44.349 --> 44:47.349
You know, he doesn't
have to come back out.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.486
Nah. Regis scared him

44:49.487 --> 44:50.957
by telling him about the video.

44:50.958 --> 44:53.056
I want to know who he
came running to about it.

45:26.825 --> 45:28.185
We have a fucking problem.

45:28.193 --> 45:31.103
Do you know that
somewhere in this building

45:31.104 --> 45:34.826
there is a shipment
of Justin Bieber wigs?

45:36.067 --> 45:38.867
I'm not mocking your being bald.

45:38.870 --> 45:41.470
You're always so fucking amused.

45:41.472 --> 45:42.807
We all make choices.

45:42.808 --> 45:44.076
Like when I chose to believe you

45:44.077 --> 45:45.205
that Crystal Harris didn't know

45:45.210 --> 45:46.340
I killed that hacker chick?

45:46.344 --> 45:47.882
Well, guess what. She does.

45:47.883 --> 45:49.348
She didn't know a few days ago.

45:49.349 --> 45:51.077
Well, she sure
as shit knows now!

45:51.082 --> 45:52.882
She about jumped out of her skin

45:52.884 --> 45:53.990
when she saw me tonight.

45:53.991 --> 45:55.245
And her fucking husband's

45:55.253 --> 45:57.059
got some video Caldwell made

45:57.060 --> 45:58.655
that's going to
blow up his case?

45:58.656 --> 45:59.826
I sincerely doubt that.

46:00.725 --> 46:03.285
You can afford doubt.

46:03.294 --> 46:05.129
I need certainty.

46:05.130 --> 46:08.000
I need you to make sure
that she never talks.

46:09.567 --> 46:12.897
Crystal Harris is going
to find Bathwater for me.

46:12.904 --> 46:14.512
I could give a flying fuck
about Bathwater!

46:14.513 --> 46:15.953
You don't need to give
a flying fuck.

46:18.043 --> 46:20.049
Give a flying fuck
about passionately

46:20.050 --> 46:21.845
is what I want, and what I want

46:21.847 --> 46:24.577
is Crystal Harris alive and free

46:24.582 --> 46:26.382
until she finishes the job.

46:28.386 --> 46:31.986
I don't want to...
mess up our arrangement,

46:31.990 --> 46:34.760
but I can't have Crystal
walking around out there.

46:34.761 --> 46:36.229
What could she prove?

46:37.628 --> 46:39.596
What can she prove?

46:39.597 --> 46:40.865
Nothing.

46:40.866 --> 46:43.696
And I wouldn't worry
about the video.

46:43.701 --> 46:45.741
Pernell Harris doesn't have it.

46:45.742 --> 46:47.106
I do.

46:52.978 --> 46:56.308
You... You motherfucker.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.681
Give it to me.

46:57.682 --> 46:59.682
No.

46:59.684 --> 47:01.751
- Give it to me.
- No.

47:01.752 --> 47:03.590
It's clearly best for both of us

47:03.591 --> 47:06.518
if I have some influence
over your actions.

48:01.980 --> 48:03.550
Motherfucker!

48:13.091 --> 48:14.991
Motherfucker.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.340
Shit.

48:51.997 --> 48:53.257
Fuck this.

49:01.572 --> 49:03.272
Keith!

49:05.410 --> 49:06.476
You all right?

49:06.477 --> 49:07.544
Yeah. Yeah.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.745
I'm all right, I think.
Just a nick.

49:09.747 --> 49:10.914
Who did this?

49:10.915 --> 49:13.015
Quick little fucker.
Dark hair, beard.

49:13.018 --> 49:15.088
He told Toby he has the tape.

49:32.903 --> 49:34.173
Heh.

49:40.511 --> 49:42.051
Now that's good.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.505
Please, God.

51:28.286 --> 51:30.156
"You were right."

51:41.699 --> 51:44.439
"The gun is going
to protect you."

51:46.704 --> 51:47.974
Evening, Judge Harris.

51:47.975 --> 51:50.307
Manny, um...

51:50.308 --> 51:52.538
give me some of your,

51:52.543 --> 51:54.353
Balvenie 40 year, would you?

51:54.354 --> 51:56.445
You know that's $500 a shot.

51:56.447 --> 51:59.547
Yeah. Yeah.
Better make it a double.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.045
Celebrating?

52:02.052 --> 52:04.321
No, I'm just trying
to make the most

52:04.322 --> 52:06.762
of my last few days of freedom.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.228
You'll beat it, sir.

52:09.229 --> 52:11.557
Your lips to God's ears, Manny.

52:16.066 --> 52:17.836
You a lefty?

52:18.936 --> 52:20.266
The only people I see

52:20.271 --> 52:21.871
using Mont Blanc ballpoints

52:21.872 --> 52:23.039
are lefties.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.780
They can't use fountain pens.

52:24.781 --> 52:27.605
Right, because there's
too much smear.

52:27.612 --> 52:30.614
Yeah, my son got me
this as a gift.

52:30.615 --> 52:33.315
Yeah, he understood because...

52:38.323 --> 52:39.493
You all right?

53:01.246 --> 53:02.806
Pernell?

53:08.886 --> 53:09.916
You okay?

53:14.124 --> 53:15.759
Page 2.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.700
Line 18, section C.

53:19.330 --> 53:20.397
Shit. Fuck. No.

53:20.398 --> 53:21.765
I don't want to look at this.

53:21.766 --> 53:22.766
Read it, Crys.

53:30.140 --> 53:31.440
"Based on fingerprints,

53:31.442 --> 53:34.010
"victim-held gun in left hand

53:34.011 --> 53:36.011
when firing fatal shot."

53:36.013 --> 53:37.581
They fucked up, Crys.

53:37.582 --> 53:40.820
They saw PJ write his suicide
note with his left hand,

53:40.821 --> 53:42.288
so they assumed
he was left-handed,

53:42.289 --> 53:44.457
so that's where they
put the gun.

53:44.458 --> 53:47.824
Except PJ did everything
else right-handed.

53:47.825 --> 53:51.295
So why would he have a gun
in his left hand?

54:03.007 --> 54:04.337
He wouldn't.

54:04.342 --> 54:06.842
Exactly.

54:09.314 --> 54:11.924
Our son didn't
shoot himself, Crys.

54:13.318 --> 54:14.618
He was murdered.
