would like to know:

04:22.240 --> 04:24.449
why have you come to Attilan?

In searching my grandfather's

Wakanda gave to the Inhumans
for safekeeping.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.739

of this piece.

12:14.340 --> 12:16.010
This is it.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.929
The second segment of the key.

12:19.930 --> 12:22.639
Aah!
[GROANS]

12:22.640 --> 12:24.599
Crystal!
What are you doing?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.719
Hard to believe, isn't it?

12:26.720 --> 12:29.429
And we're just getting started.

12:29.430 --> 12:30.549
Ugh.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.839
[GROANS]

12:32.840 --> 12:34.155
She copied me!

12:34.156 --> 12:35.469
She copied me!

12:35.470 --> 12:38.759
Ms. Marvel, she cannot
have copied everything!

12:38.760 --> 12:40.679
You're right!
[GRUNTS]

12:40.680 --> 12:42.259
Embiggen!

12:42.260 --> 12:44.100
[BOTH GRUNTING]

12:47.470 --> 12:48.799
Take that, copycat!

12:48.800 --> 12:50.799
[GRUNTS]

12:50.800 --> 12:53.220
Kamala?

12:54.260 --> 12:56.759
Absolutely.
[GRUNTS]

12:56.760 --> 12:58.640
[GROANS]

12:59.840 --> 13:03.640
Panther?
Black Panther, are you okay?

13:05.010 --> 13:07.889
[GROANS]
I am fine.

13:07.890 --> 13:10.139
Good. Now we must...

13:10.140 --> 13:13.969
You must sit there at the bottom of
that pit for the rest of your lives.

13:13.970 --> 13:15.799
Oh.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.139
Hello there.

13:17.661 --> 13:20.839
Okay, I'm just letting everybody
know I don't have a twin sister.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.924
[BLACK PANTHER]
She is a shape-shifter.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.682
Oh, don't pretend
you're so smart.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.679
I fooled you.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.759
Admit it. You thought I was
Crystal and Ms. Marvel.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.429
But it was me all the time,

13:34.430 --> 13:37.139
the lovely and amazing Zanda,

13:37.140 --> 13:39.179
Princess of Narobia.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.799
Acknowledge my brilliance.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.389
Greetings, Zanda.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.845
Wait. You know her?

13:44.846 --> 13:46.299
We have met.

13:46.300 --> 13:50.219
I invited him to my Naming
Festival, and he refused.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.759
Can you believe it?
So rude.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.679
You sent six warriors
to kidnap me.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.929
It's a tradition.

13:58.930 --> 14:03.219
Okay, I see this is totally a TMI
situation with your ex-GF, but...

14:03.220 --> 14:05.255
She is not my ex-GF.

14:06.260 --> 14:09.839
Zanda has...
self-esteem issues.

14:09.840 --> 14:13.549
She gets into trouble trying to
prove her superiority over others.

14:13.650 --> 14:18.939
Zanda, whatever you think you
are doing, you must stop now.

14:18.940 --> 14:21.740
- The Shadow Council...
- They are my friends.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.239
They respect me.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.859
They see my greatness.

14:25.860 --> 14:28.359
I'm a princess,
I have superpowers,

14:28.360 --> 14:30.739
and, oh, yes, I have tricked

14:30.740 --> 14:33.239
the oh-so-brilliant
King Black Panther

14:33.240 --> 14:35.939
into leading me to this!

14:35.940 --> 14:39.569
I have known you to be
greedy and vain, Zanda,

14:39.570 --> 14:41.439
but working
for the Shadow Council?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.239
I'm not working
<i>for</i> the Shadow Council,

14:44.240 --> 14:45.899
I'm on it.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.699
And you were right.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.939
Nowhere is safe from us.

14:49.940 --> 14:52.940
Soon the shadow will cover all.

14:56.490 --> 14:59.739
I can't believe you dated her!

14:59.740 --> 15:02.109
We met, as I said, once.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.989
There was no dating.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.400
Did she always have the,
you know...

15:08.030 --> 15:09.030
I do not know.

15:09.031 --> 15:11.530
How long do you think she's
been on the Shadow Council?

15:11.531 --> 15:13.029
I do not know.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.529
[MS. MARVEL] What is this
Shadow Council, anyway?

15:15.530 --> 15:17.199
Why aren't the Avengers
in on this?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.989
It is a Wakandan matter, Kamala.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.989
- I am only doing what the mission...
- Oh, no.

15:21.990 --> 15:24.199
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't get to pull that

15:24.200 --> 15:26.989
"for the good of the mission"
stuff on me.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.149
I might be young,
but I'm still an Avenger.

15:29.150 --> 15:32.569
We wouldn't be in this stupid pit if you'd
been honest with me from the start.

15:32.570 --> 15:35.609
Honesty is not
the issue. I...

15:35.610 --> 15:37.149
We will continue this later.

15:37.150 --> 15:40.069
For now, we must get out
and stop Princess Zanda.

15:40.070 --> 15:43.320
[GROANING]

15:45.320 --> 15:48.239
Whoa! Hey! Get away!

15:48.240 --> 15:49.635
[GRUNTS]

15:49.636 --> 15:51.029
[BLACK PANTHER]
Do not be alarmed.

15:51.030 --> 15:53.029
Are you who you appear to be?

15:53.030 --> 15:55.939
I'm Crystal,
of the Inhuman Royal Family.

15:55.940 --> 15:58.069
Ha! We've heard
that before.

15:58.070 --> 16:00.030
If you're the real Crystal,
prove it.

16:06.940 --> 16:09.149
Okay, you're her.
I'm Ms. Marvel.

16:09.150 --> 16:12.149
That's Black Panther. We're Avengers.
I am. He was.

16:12.150 --> 16:15.029
His ex-GF's a bad guy.
She pretended to be you.

16:15.030 --> 16:16.939
Long story.
How are you?

16:16.940 --> 16:19.939
I don't know.
The last I remember,

16:19.940 --> 16:23.199
someone knocked me out,
and then I woke up in here.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.529
You were abducted by the
same party who put us here...

16:26.530 --> 16:28.939
the shape changer,
Princess Zanda.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.529
She posed as you to
infiltrate the royal family.

16:31.530 --> 16:34.109
We need to get out of here
and warn them.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.279
[GRUNTING]

16:36.785 --> 16:39.029
No use.
It's covered tight.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.199
No matter. I have
pinpointed our location.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.069
The way out is not up.
It is down.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.030
[GRUNTING]

16:49.030 --> 16:50.860
[GRUNTING]

16:57.972 --> 17:00.029
How is this better than the pit?

17:00.030 --> 17:01.852
Patience.

17:10.990 --> 17:15.700
Too easy. This will show the Shadow
Council I'm truly unstoppable.

17:17.575 --> 17:19.605
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you're stoppable.

17:20.075 --> 17:21.529
Think again, little girl.

17:22.230 --> 17:24.690
- Like I told you when we first met Zanda,
- [GASPS]

17:24.693 --> 17:26.560
it is not happening.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.709
Aah!

17:29.710 --> 17:32.630
[BOTH GRUNTING]

17:37.710 --> 17:40.900
Your parents will be very
disappointed in you. [GRUNTS]

17:40.901 --> 17:43.059
You're too late.
They already are.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.769
This is not a game, Zanda.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.129
[BOTH GRUNTING]

17:46.130 --> 17:47.799
Give me the key segment!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.799
No! It's mine!

17:49.800 --> 17:51.629
I stole it fair and square!

17:51.630 --> 17:52.879
[GRUNTS]

17:52.880 --> 17:54.209
[GRUNTS]

17:54.210 --> 17:56.249
[GRUNTING]

17:56.250 --> 18:00.039
You're just like my parents.
"Be a good girl, Zanda.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.419
Do your duty, Zanda.
Be quiet. Be pretty."

18:03.420 --> 18:06.539
Well, I'm not
just a pretty face.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.749
I'm one of the deadliest
fighters on the planet!

18:09.750 --> 18:11.045
[MS. MARVEL] Yeah?

18:11.070 --> 18:12.070
[GRUNTS]

18:14.040 --> 18:17.089
Well, I eat deadly fighters
for breakfast,

18:17.090 --> 18:20.169
and breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.839
[CHARGING YELL]

18:22.840 --> 18:25.299
[GRUNTING] Nope.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.630
[GRUNTS]

18:29.500 --> 18:31.209
Ms. Marvel, catch!

18:31.210 --> 18:33.209
[GRUNTS]

18:33.210 --> 18:36.040
[GRUNTING]

18:37.420 --> 18:39.040
[GRUNTS]

18:42.300 --> 18:45.129
Little pest.
Give that back!

18:45.130 --> 18:46.339
[BOTH GRUNT]

18:46.340 --> 18:48.249
[GRUNTS]

18:48.750 --> 18:50.001
Ow.

18:50.001 --> 18:51.040
[CHUCKLES, GASPS]

18:51.840 --> 18:53.339
Ugh!

18:53.340 --> 18:55.130
[BOTH GRUNT]

18:56.090 --> 18:58.089
[GRUNTS]

18:58.090 --> 18:59.299
[CHUCKLES]

18:59.300 --> 19:01.346
[LAUGHS]

19:01.390 --> 19:05.599
What do you think?
Pretty good likeness, right?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.049
Copy whatever form
you want, Zanda.

19:08.050 --> 19:10.099
It will not change the outcome.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.390
[BOTH GRUNTING]

19:15.340 --> 19:17.010
[MS. MARVEL]
Hold it right there!

19:19.340 --> 19:21.469
Ms. Marvel, it is me!

19:21.470 --> 19:23.509
She's lying. Get her!

19:23.510 --> 19:26.259
No! Do not
listen to her!

19:26.260 --> 19:29.639
Gimme a break.
Black Panther and I are friends.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.889
I know the real him.
Embiggen!

19:31.890 --> 19:33.800
[GROANS]

19:35.840 --> 19:37.600
[GROANS]

19:40.640 --> 19:42.840
[GRUNTS]

19:44.010 --> 19:46.639
That belongs
to the Shadow Council.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.969
Give it back, or else I'll...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.930
What is the meaning of this?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.679
All right.
Well, I have to run.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.219
Till we meet again.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.799
Medusa, love the hair.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.179
Mwah!

20:02.180 --> 20:04.600
[CHUCKLES, GRUNTS]

20:09.640 --> 20:12.549
Our decision was final,
King T'Challa,

20:12.550 --> 20:15.179
yet still you ignored
our direct...

20:15.180 --> 20:17.009
[GRUNTS]
This isn't right.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.549
Black Panther was only
trying to protect the key.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.839
Hold your tongue, Crystal.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.259
Why should I?
Because I'm young?

20:24.260 --> 20:27.389
You're only saying that
because you know I'm right!

20:27.390 --> 20:28.969
There was no other way.

20:28.970 --> 20:31.389
Trust me.
Trust Crystal.

20:31.390 --> 20:34.140
I am the only one
who can keep the key safe.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.259
We... have been arrogant.

20:41.260 --> 20:45.099
We never imagined a spy could
infiltrate our city in the sky,

20:45.100 --> 20:48.202
much less the royal family.

20:48.430 --> 20:52.299
Even here in the clouds, you are
not safe from the Shadow Council.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.889
Be vigilant.

20:53.890 --> 20:56.799
We shall look forward
to the next royal dinner.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.336
They're always...

20:59.014 --> 21:01.049
unpredictable.

21:02.091 --> 21:05.378
[MS. MARVEL] If you ever want me to
go on another secret spy mission,

21:05.460 --> 21:07.339
you can just ask me
to help you, and I will.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.019
I could not have
done this without you.

21:10.020 --> 21:13.139
Yeah, I totally could've
been a secret agent spy.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.229
When Princess Zanda
duplicated me,

21:15.230 --> 21:17.059
how did you tell us apart?

21:17.060 --> 21:19.139
She had the key, you didn't.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.799
[LAUGHS]

21:20.800 --> 21:25.939
You are a terrible sidekick, Kamala,
but a very good secret agent spy.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.325
And a great friend.
