<i>This is not a dream.</i>

00:26.292 --> 00:29.261
<i>This is not a dream.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:31.497
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:54.453
This is not a dream.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.455
This is not a dream.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.722
This is not a dream.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.124
Not a dream.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.973
How did I get here?

01:47.975 --> 01:51.143
I don't know. Somebody
just transferred me here.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.178
I don't wanna give you
my information again.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.780
I just told someone 5 times.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.083
Can one of you behave like
a real person, please?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.186
I'm calling about...

02:01.188 --> 02:03.422
Right, yes, I'm her son.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.160
What kind of cancer are we talking about?

02:08.162 --> 02:10.762
What are our options?

02:10.764 --> 02:13.632
What about a liver transplant?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.033
Why not?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.169
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.971
Trust me.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.306
What's her Child-Pugh score?

02:21.308 --> 02:23.242
B. Uh...

02:23.244 --> 02:24.776
What about her bilirubin levels?

02:24.778 --> 02:27.513
If they're low enough,
they might consider yttrium-90.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.715
Hold on. You have
really bad social skills.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.017
Can you pretend to not
listen to my conversation?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.785
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.954
Eyes on the prize. Yeah.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.324
What about yttrium-90?

02:39.326 --> 02:41.593
Her bilirubin levels are too high.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.896
Okay, listen. I'm gonna get on a
flight in the morning.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.697
Uh, so I should be at the hospital by 3.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.934
Just have her call me tonight,
so I know I'm wanted.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.002
Thanks.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.004
Fuck.

02:52.006 --> 02:55.207
- This is about your mom?
- Yeah.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.808
How long are they giving her?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.877
I don't know, a few years.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.313
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.417
What are you doing?

03:05.419 --> 03:08.720
I gotta roll a joint before
the meteor shower starts.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.189
Why?

03:10.191 --> 03:14.693
We're about to watch
a fucking meteor shower. "Why."

03:14.695 --> 03:15.894
Oh, here.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.364
That's for when you apply
to college in a few years.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.367
Use me as a reference.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.569
You're a postdoctoral scientist

03:23.571 --> 03:25.437
at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.706
- Yup.
- So you already knew...

03:27.708 --> 03:30.108
Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.578
Anyway, I should be able to help you

03:32.580 --> 03:35.781
get you into a top ten
pre-med in a few years.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.816
What makes you think I wanna go pre-med?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.651
Well, other than the fact that

03:39.653 --> 03:41.453
you know what yttrium-90 is

03:41.455 --> 03:44.089
when most of your peers are still battling

03:44.091 --> 03:47.292
to crack the mysteries of parallel parking.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.660
That's just because my mom...

03:48.662 --> 03:50.696
Your mom died of
liver cancer. Yeah, I know.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.731
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to

03:52.733 --> 03:55.033
what could only be a picture of your mom.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.301
She fits the age range.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.337
And you guys have the same nose bridge.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.206
Makes sense you wanting to become
a doctor that saves people.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.076
Right? To make up for the doctor
that couldn't save your mom.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.279
Then, with time,
those good intentions will fade

04:06.280 --> 04:08.847
and it'll become about the
money like it always does.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.250
And you'll become bitter,
like everyone always becomes.

04:11.252 --> 04:15.487
And then you die, probably from cancer.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.290
You know, because that's ironic.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.825
Is there something wrong with you?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.892
Probably, yeah.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.795
<i>Don't worry, I'm working on it.</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:25.631
<i>I just fired my therapist.</i>

04:25.633 --> 04:27.466
<i>She was such an idiot though.</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:28.634
She diagnosed me with

04:28.636 --> 04:31.503
narcissistic personality disorder.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.505
She said I'm under the grand delusion

04:33.507 --> 04:35.587
that I'm the smartest person in the world.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.946
To which I responded,
"What if I really am?"

04:41.981 --> 04:44.349
- You know?
- Hey, over here.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.817
Watch out!

06:05.298 --> 06:06.598
You okay?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.874
You alright?

06:17.677 --> 06:20.278
This... this doesn't feel real.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.346
What?

06:22.982 --> 06:24.783
I feel like my life just flashed

06:24.785 --> 06:27.486
before my eyes, you know, like in a movie

06:27.488 --> 06:29.621
where the main character
dies in the beginning

06:29.623 --> 06:33.158
but he keeps going,
not realizing he's dead.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.460
Hey, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.462
It's like, um...
What is it? It's...

06:37.464 --> 06:39.364
Oh, um, sure, uh, yeah.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.533
Like, uh, Bruce Willis
in "The Sixth Sense?"

06:41.535 --> 06:43.235
Exactly. Yeah.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.570
Wait, no. You know what,
I never saw that. Shit.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.606
That's the twist that
everyone was talking about?

06:47.608 --> 06:50.175
Bruce Willis dies in the
beginning of that. That sucks.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.244
Ah, I really wanted
to see that. Fuck.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.349
I'm sorry. I guess I just
thought everyone had seen it.

06:57.351 --> 07:00.452
No, don't worry.
Now, I'm not that mad.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.355
I mean I am, but I'll get over it.

07:03.357 --> 07:04.689
That's a lie.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.259
I'll probably harbor this
for a few months at least

07:07.261 --> 07:09.828
and then, you know, we'll see.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.363
See what happens.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.698
Oh, that's cute.
Do you have an eating problem?

07:15.835 --> 07:18.036
Oh, not like...

07:18.038 --> 07:19.638
Sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.474
Dude, come on, you do realize my date

07:22.476 --> 07:24.743
isn't the one with the
eating problem, right?

07:26.646 --> 07:27.712
Oh.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.251
Wha...
Uh-oh, Kimberly's annoyed.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.838
Kimberly.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.779
Kimberly.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.684
Hey.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.122
- How do you do that?
- What?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.924
I haven't seen you in a year

08:12.926 --> 08:15.894
when I was literally
just thinking about you.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.930
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Because of that song.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.200
I was listening to it as
I was walking here.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.136
It reminded me of the hotel.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.939
The one we stayed at for my
friend's wedding in Paris.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.941
Yeah, yeah, Paris.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.677
City of Lights and pretension as I recall.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.914
We had one of our biggest fights.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.216
And that was your friend's
wedding from Wisconsin, right?

08:38.217 --> 08:40.652
What was her name, Lenora or Lee Anora?

08:40.654 --> 08:43.554
- Sarah? Right.
- I remember that wedding.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.857
I remember that was the one where the DJ

08:45.859 --> 08:47.626
played that Montell Jordan song twice.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.195
I remember,
the first time we thought it was ironic

08:50.197 --> 08:52.237
then we realized he just liked the song.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.267
Definitely our biggest fight.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.835
The beginning of the end, really.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.903
Yeah.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.305
Yeah.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.674
Look, It's like the Beatles, right?

09:02.676 --> 09:05.544
I mean, I liked them when I was 5.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.297
But at a certain point,
you just want something

09:07.323 --> 09:08.647
with a little more nuance, you know?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.082
Don't get me wrong. I could
handle them a little better

09:11.084 --> 09:13.184
when they had Pete Best to ground them

09:13.186 --> 09:16.288
but past that, I don't know,
they just got so pedestrian.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.626
- Do you come here a lot?
- Do I come to the cemetery?

09:21.628 --> 09:24.195
I like cemeteries.
You know, they're romantic.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.530
Especially this one.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.066
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.969
Yeah, I read somewhere it's gonna overtake
football in America in the next 2 years.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.071
- Really? 2 years?
- A friend of mine described it.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.573
Clock's ticking.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.943
He blogged, "Soccer's...
soccer's chess on a field."

09:37.945 --> 09:41.181
Do you have a vomit bag...
vomit bags on you?

09:41.207 --> 09:43.081
I'll send you the link.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.883
I guess we could just...
I'd hate to throw up on a grave.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.452
Why didn't you just go to the
Griffith Park Observatory

09:47.454 --> 09:48.787
then to watch the meteor shower?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.622
Oh, they have assholes
there too. Trust me.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.023
There're assholes all over the city

09:52.025 --> 09:54.859
But rarely do you get to be
next to one so spectacular.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.662
The only knock on him though, I have
to say, is that he's from New York.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.265
I can't stand that place.
Seriously. It's so overrated.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.702
Why? Because of all the bridges and the
culture and the history they have?

10:03.704 --> 10:06.271
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.073
They got so many
more T.G.I. Fridays.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.676
Do I love L.A.? You know, Los
Angeles is just more modern.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.478
It has a certain relevancy about it

10:13.480 --> 10:15.013
New York just doesn't have anymore.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.682
Kimberly, I was wondering if
I could have your number?

10:18.751 --> 10:20.752
- What?
- Your phone number?

10:22.088 --> 10:25.090
Dude... she's with me.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.025
No.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.028
- Uh, yeah, she is.
- No, she's not.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.597
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.132
And I'm shocked that that even happened.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.868
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.671
Most likely you are but maybe
not. You're incredibly handsome

10:39.673 --> 10:41.640
and you were probably very
handsome when you were a kid, too.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.309
I think that explains your lack
of substance and personality.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.344
Only because nobody's ever
really challenged you before.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.913
So now as an adult
you think everything you say

10:48.915 --> 10:50.782
means something,
but it means nothing actually.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.450
You don't know what you're talking about.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.020
And it's really upsetting. And I think
she probably sees through that.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.422
You're very pretty,
but you're shallow beyond belief.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.395
Anyway, can I have your number?

11:03.397 --> 11:05.697
- Okay, okay.
- What are you doing?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.332
You just said all that shit.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.068
Yeah, but it was just an observation.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.906
And you ask my girl out in front of me?

11:17.576 --> 11:19.310
Oh, shit. Sorry, my mistake.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.080
I see that now. I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.181
What?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.983
No. I just should be
more of a realist.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.351
I should know that I'm a C, maybe a C plus

11:26.353 --> 11:28.286
in the winter time when
I can cover up my body more.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.488
And even though you're a douche bag,
you're still incredibly attractive.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.450
So maybe it's only fair you two pair.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.662
- What? It rhymed.
- She's right, it rhymed.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.497
Let's...
Can you just put me down?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.866
This is embarrassing now for everyone.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.702
Okay. Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.471
- Let's... Let's just go. Come on.
- Oh, yeah...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.473
Gotta get a good seat.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.845
The only thing wrong with you

11:53.847 --> 11:56.548
is you're chicken shit.
That's all.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.084
- That's not the only problem.
- Let's go. Excuse me.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.086
- Excuse me.
- One of many.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.522
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.158
I shouldn't have talked.
That's when I get into trouble.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.495
I'm sorry I made fun of your
sandwich bag. I didn't mean to.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.497
Actually, that's not true, I did.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.000
Sorry. I'm really nervous.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.436
It's okay.
I'm sorry he bothered you.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.572
I was not nervous because of him.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.611
Okay. Bye.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.718
She is so...

12:35.421 --> 12:37.122
<i>Beautiful.</i>

12:41.694 --> 12:43.762
<i>Kim, come on, the wedding's in an hour.</i>

12:43.764 --> 12:46.631
<i>You gotta get ready.</i>

12:46.633 --> 12:51.269
So... have you ever
dreamt about me?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.438
- Dreamt about you?
- Yeah.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.107
You know, in the 700 plus days we've dated.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.744
You ever dreamt about me?

12:59.746 --> 13:02.280
So... Yeah, of course.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.716
Oh, yeah? Like, uh, sex dreams?

13:04.718 --> 13:08.086
At first, but then we had sex,
and that went away.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.289
Ha. Is that how you
really wanna say that?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.591
So I was all hot to trot for you

13:13.593 --> 13:14.859
or whatever in the beginning.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.896
And now, you know, reality has set in.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.430
But that's not what I meant.
I meant like...

13:19.432 --> 13:23.168
A dream, like ambiguous depictions

13:23.170 --> 13:25.703
of what we are or were, or could be.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.805
Stuff like that.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.307
Can you stop already? I got it.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.843
- Why, I oughta...
- Oh, hey, whoo.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.645
Put that down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.947
- What are you doing?
- I'm a give you what for.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.282
Oh, yeah?

13:38.384 --> 13:39.450
Yeah.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.054
You good?

13:44.957 --> 13:47.926
Okay. Okay.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.260
That was fun.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.830
Does it bother you that
you don't make me happy?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.565
- Always with the jokes.
- I'm serious.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.134
Seriously? You went from sex
dreams to not being happy?

13:56.136 --> 13:58.469
False. I wasn't talking
about sex dreams, you were.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.772
And secondly, I'm a girl,
so yes, we non-sequitur.

14:00.774 --> 14:04.809
- That's a little cliched.
- I want a baby.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.977
Point taken.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.047
Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.851
Someday, sure.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.321
But let's burn that bridge
when we get to it, okay?

14:16.323 --> 14:19.157
See? Not making me happy.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.026
How do you do that?
How do you do that?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.835
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.171
She's beyond beautiful.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.306
And she's real.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.876
She seems funny, too.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.679
And there's a hint of crazy, I can feel it.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.581
Beautiful, crazy, and funny.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.483
Jesus Christ. She's perfect.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.819
It's really annoying. Really...

14:51.957 --> 14:56.094
That's two near collisions
for you now in a row.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.430
Well, at least this one's nonfatal.

15:02.701 --> 15:03.768
Okay.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.874
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.316
- Bye.
- Uh, yeah.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.754
What the fuck was that?

15:47.313 --> 15:49.314
Wait. Wait.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.552
What are we doing?

15:55.955 --> 15:59.223
Are we in a chase scene now?
What are we doing?

16:01.327 --> 16:02.894
Wait, just stop for a second.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.333
So I thought I saw somebody,
a friend of mine

16:08.335 --> 16:09.600
behind you coming over.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.270
So that's why I turned around and waited.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.372
So what's the big deal?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.240
It wasn't because you were watching me?

16:16.242 --> 16:18.543
Because it looked like
you were kinda watching me.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.812
No, it was because of a friend

16:20.814 --> 16:22.447
that was behind you.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.516
So they're not there now obviously.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.318
Besides, you were being weird.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.421
You were talking to yourself.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.689
What were you saying anyway?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.791
You say "so" a lot.
It's really annoying.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.293
So...

16:35.295 --> 16:37.095
Are you trying to make this awkward now?

16:37.097 --> 16:39.430
- It feels awkward now.
- Awkward feels good to me.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.366
And awkward feels awkward to me.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.002
That's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

16:45.604 --> 16:47.138
I'm not trying to fuck you.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.641
If that's what you're
worried about, I mean.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.978
I'm not gonna ask you out because
I don't believe in love.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.080
I think all relationships
deteriorate into hate

16:56.082 --> 16:59.150
indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.352
My parents have been together for 32 years.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.255
- And they're happily in love.
- No, they're not.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.857
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.392
If they haven't divorced by now

17:07.394 --> 17:08.925
probably means they've just
surrendered to the fact

17:08.928 --> 17:10.795
that being apart isn't much
better than being together.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.563
You know, the lesser of two evils.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.133
Trust me, it's like an emotional holocaust
between your parents right now.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.602
They probably have lukewarm
feelings about you too.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.002
I'm Dell, by the way.

17:19.005 --> 17:24.041
So, no offense, but I have
a-a thing about shaking hands.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.944
Oh, my God.
You are a little crazy.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.580
That's great.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.749
- You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.318
You know, you should stop trying
to sound so smart all the time.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.387
You just wind up sounding really dumb.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.423
It's just I realized why
you date guys like that.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.758
You have terrible taste in men
because you're superficial.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.326
You're fooling yourself in the hopes

17:42.328 --> 17:43.694
of finding something redeemable.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.930
It's because of love.
That's your blind spot.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.598
You gotta give up on that.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.370
Wow. Okay.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.405
Well, I thank you for
your insight, stranger

17:54.407 --> 17:58.676
but I actually believe love is real.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.744
I'm gonna go now.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.812
Wait.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.981
Can I still get your...

18:10.456 --> 18:12.257
- Hello, boyfriend.
- Hey.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.626
Hey, listen, Roxette's on,
and the good part is coming up.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.361
Can I call you back?

18:17.363 --> 18:19.397
Wait-wait, I just have to tell you
something more important really quick.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.200
You know that book I've been reading,
"The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins...

18:22.202 --> 18:27.572
♪ <i>Leave the winter on the ground</i> ♪

18:27.574 --> 18:29.740
There's this fascinating part
I just read about memes.

18:29.742 --> 18:33.511
He basically says that ideas are like
genes that self-replicate and mutate

18:33.513 --> 18:35.947
like a cultural form of evolution...

18:35.949 --> 18:40.751
♪ <i>Touch me now, I close my eyes...</i> ♪

18:40.753 --> 18:42.787
I was thinking how that
applies to us, you know?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.890
The idea of us, how we've
really mutated and evolved...

18:45.892 --> 18:50.928
♪ <i>And it's a hard winter's day...</i> ♪

18:50.930 --> 18:54.098
Right? because you think about it, we were
just dumb, young kids when we first met.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.167
And then we broke up, got back together,
blah blah blah.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.804
And now,
we're this really mature, loving couple

18:59.806 --> 19:01.639
who's grown respect and
admiration for each other.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.374
You know what I mean?

19:05.210 --> 19:06.277
Kimberly?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.281
You hung up on me, didn't you?

19:10.283 --> 19:13.184
♪ <i>But it's over now</i> ♪

19:13.186 --> 19:16.020
♪ <i>From the moment we touched</i> ♪

19:16.022 --> 19:19.557
♪ <i>Until the time had run out</i> ♪

19:19.559 --> 19:23.060
♪ <i>Yeah</i> ♪♪

19:31.670 --> 19:33.771
Well, maybe you could.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.844
Well, because I'd like her
to be at the best place.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.647
Well, then maybe you can
introduce me to the head guy

19:42.649 --> 19:44.515
at the cancer immunology lab.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.118
Because I've taken an interest, that's all.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.920
Yes, mom, I meditated.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.722
I meditate before every date,
but it didn't help.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.325
Face facts, no one thinks
I'm special but you.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.095
Well, I'm still technically on it.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.966
But it's not working out, trust me.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.969
He called himself a Bob Dylan song

20:04.971 --> 20:08.773
and then proceeded to call
me a Britney Spears song.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.576
I don't know what it means
either, but it sounds insulting.

20:11.578 --> 20:15.680
No, not him. Uh, the one
with glasses, mustache.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.815
Looks like a child trafficker.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.485
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.521
Well, if I...

20:26.091 --> 20:28.926
I gotta go. I gotta go.

20:32.497 --> 20:36.133
Can I ask you a serious question?

20:36.135 --> 20:39.437
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.582
Okay, I'm back. Uh-huh.

20:54.853 --> 20:57.521
- Well, I'm at...
- I have to talk to you.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.523
- I'm on the phone.
- No, it's really important.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.792
- Really important.
- I'm on the friggin' phone.

21:01.794 --> 21:05.329
Have you ever cried at one of
these things? I was wondering.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.133
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.370
- One of what things?
- These meteor shower things.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.804
Cried?

21:13.806 --> 21:16.140
Yeah, you know,
like tears of joy, that kind of thing.

21:16.142 --> 21:19.644
No. I've never cried
at one of these things.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.445
Neither have I. Ever, ever.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.481
In fact, I don't understand people that do.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.783
It's kind of bullshit,
happy crying is, isn't it?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.119
What are your thoughts on that?

21:28.121 --> 21:31.022
So I was on the phone.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.391
So, yeah, you were on the phone.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.459
Sorry. Was it important?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.028
More important than your question?

21:37.030 --> 21:39.730
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.266
My mistake. Sorry.
I'll never interrupt you again.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.001
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.303
Well...

21:46.772 --> 21:48.372
I should get back to my date.
He's probably...

21:48.374 --> 21:49.907
But I just wanna keep talking to you.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.542
- What?
- I wanna keep talking to you for multiple reasons.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.678
I mean, you're beautiful, but
it's more than that. I promise.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.614
That's very nice, but I should go.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.883
Maybe I'll see you in the
winter when you're a C plus.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.919
See? I knew it. I knew you
were superficial. I told you.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.322
The only reason that you're talking
to me is because you think I'm hot.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.624
Yeah, but the only reason why you
won't is because you think I'm not.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.659
Fine. Give me a reason
why I should?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.698
I was saying, "Don't miss her."

22:13.700 --> 22:16.600
Earlier, when you saw me talking to myself.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."

22:16.602 --> 22:19.403
I'm always so afraid I'm gonna
miss the important things in life.

22:19.405 --> 22:22.073
Something about you has given me a
heightened curiosity to know you better.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.831
And that is a near impossible
feat when it comes

22:23.857 --> 22:25.443
to me because
I hate getting to know people.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.812
But I can tell you're not like the others.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.914
- What others?
- People.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.849
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.217
Yeah, you're not phony like them.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.554
Also, I didn't say you were hot.
I said you are beautiful.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.061
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.201
It's a beautiful night though.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.573
What?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.875
I never know what that
means when people say

22:57.877 --> 23:01.345
that it's a beautiful night?
What does it mean?

23:01.347 --> 23:04.982
So... well, to me

23:04.984 --> 23:09.787
means it's comfortable, familiar...

23:09.789 --> 23:11.522
Yet deeply moving.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.124
Right, no... I feel you

23:13.126 --> 23:17.995
like, uh, like getting stoned
and listening to Steely Dan.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.530
No. Nothing at all like that.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.899
No... I know. More like...

23:21.901 --> 23:23.267
Yeah, like...

23:23.269 --> 23:26.170
Floating down a serene lake in a rowboat

23:26.172 --> 23:29.240
when the sun is setting
or rising... or when the sun is

23:29.242 --> 23:30.508
being a part of nature.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.143
- Stop speaking.
- Okay.

23:32.145 --> 23:36.080
It's beautiful when the
weather is not hot or cold.

23:37.983 --> 23:39.517
Kinda like you don't notice it.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.586
Kinda like it's perfect because
everything is so balanced.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.922
You don't even feel it.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.292
And while you're feeling that non-feeling

23:48.294 --> 23:50.961
you look up in the sky

23:50.963 --> 23:55.199
and you almost think that's why.

23:55.201 --> 23:59.737
Because how everything is right
now, all the stars and planets

23:59.739 --> 24:04.141
and us and the ground,
and the cells and molecules

24:04.143 --> 24:09.613
right now... is exactly
the reason

24:09.615 --> 24:12.316
why now is comfortable.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.119
- You're a now person.
- True.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.821
Yeah, see, I'm a 5-minutes-from-now person.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.924
Because 5 minutes from now,
a gust of wind could come in

24:19.926 --> 24:22.159
and blow H1N1 in everyone's eyes.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.795
Right. Except
that's highly unlikely.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.097
Or 5 minutes from now,
an earthquake could erupt

24:27.099 --> 24:28.933
and swallow us all whole.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.801
Right. Except that...

24:30.803 --> 24:32.436
No, shit, that could actually happen.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.238
Yeah. The point is I'm way too
anxious about what could happen

24:34.240 --> 24:36.807
5 minutes from now to be content with now.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.409
Can't do it.

24:38.411 --> 24:40.978
What if something good
happens 5 minutes from now?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.781
- Can't that happen?
- No.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.583
What did you think was gonna happen

24:45.585 --> 24:47.585
5 minutes before you met me?

24:54.960 --> 24:57.361
I'm just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.

24:57.363 --> 24:59.830
I miss things a lot.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.866
I don't care if I miss it because...

25:01.868 --> 25:03.868
You're a now person. Got it.

25:07.272 --> 25:10.307
So another weird thing.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.642
I don't mind your pessimism

25:11.644 --> 25:14.345
as much as I usually mind pessimism.

25:14.347 --> 25:18.349
That's great. I hate people
who think I'm too negative.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.351
Also, I like your hat.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.555
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
fall in love with you.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.430
Wow.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.702
That's it?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.638
What were you hoping for?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.339
I'm going to fall in love with you, too?

25:42.341 --> 25:45.609
No, but... Well, yeah.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.012
So all that stuff about not
believing in relationships...

25:48.014 --> 25:49.934
Oh, that's just a pick-up line.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.384
Do we have a deal then?

25:53.386 --> 25:54.919
<i>Cause you said you believe in love.</i>

25:54.921 --> 25:56.954
I don't.
Let's put it to the test.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.489
Date each other. Me and you.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.991
In a relationship. Let's do it.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.075
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?

26:18.077 --> 26:21.645
I should be scared to death
of who you are as a person.

26:21.647 --> 26:24.181
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.583
Death. Literally.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.251
I'd probably have a coronary

26:27.253 --> 26:29.053
right as I'm walking up the aisle.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.088
Oh, God, please invite me to your wedding.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.257
I would love to see that.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.595
Well, that's morbid and telling.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.697
Yeah, well,
if snuff films were readily available

26:39.699 --> 26:41.699
I'd probably watch them, not gonna lie.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.701
Is that a deal breaker for you?

26:43.703 --> 26:45.336
No, because for some reason

26:45.338 --> 26:47.638
I still happen to be in love with you.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.374
No, it's because you didn't think
that you'd be the one marrying me.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.509
You don't smoke weed. What are you doing?
Don't do that.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.511
<i>So do you still love me?</i>

26:54.513 --> 26:57.314
I tell you all the time,
if you died right now

26:57.316 --> 27:00.517
I'd visit your grave every single day.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.554
Not every day, that's crazy.

27:03.556 --> 27:06.790
<i>That doesn't answer the question.</i>

27:06.792 --> 27:08.792
Of course, I love you.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.901
<i>It never sounds real when you say it.</i>

27:20.338 --> 27:22.506
<i>Like it doesn't exist.</i>

27:51.603 --> 27:54.104
So what are you doing here?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.740
- Going up north.
- Why would you do that?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.809
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

27:58.811 --> 28:02.379
I'm... I'm kidding.
I'm going to meet someone.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.785
So right, okay.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.691
- How's your mom doing?
- She's actually fine.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.793
I can't believe
I haven't talked to you this long.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.295
Yeah, turns out her
doctors are huge idiots.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.697
So I kinda took matters in my own hand.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.365
I figured out a way to dose her
with that experimental drug

28:21.367 --> 28:22.900
we've been developing in our lab.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.402
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.438
No.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.541
Wasn't that extremely dangerous?

28:30.543 --> 28:33.010
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- She's fine now?

28:33.012 --> 28:36.046
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission. So...

28:36.048 --> 28:37.781
- Dell, that's great.
- Yeah.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.249
I mean, other than the

28:39.251 --> 28:41.785
totally-unethical-recklessly-
risking-your-mom's-life part.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.922
That's... that's,
You... you saved her.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.190
Yeah, I guess.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.559
We should probably keep that
between us... by the way

28:48.561 --> 28:51.962
Because there's a good chance
what I did was illegal... ish.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.732
Right.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.969
- Oh.
- All aboard.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.805
Right. We should probably...

29:01.807 --> 29:03.807
Okay, right.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.976
Well, still, wow.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.945
I can't believe you're curing cancer now.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.747
Does that mean you've
stopped hating people?

29:09.749 --> 29:10.814
Not at all.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.485
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.254
Right?

29:17.989 --> 29:19.857
Who is that?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.658
- Really?
- I don't know who that is.

29:21.660 --> 29:25.162
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
annoying... wife.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.230
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.598
Oh.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.901
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.503
Great hair.

29:32.505 --> 29:35.439
Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.977
I definitely have to shit out of this one.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.579
Olga Kordinstitch? Who is that?

29:42.581 --> 29:45.382
I don't know. I've just
always wanted to fuck an Olga.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.519
I would definitely marry Tupac.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.754
Kimberly Shakur.

29:50.756 --> 29:53.557
It's got a good ring to it.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.593
I would definitely
"F" Edward R. Murrow.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.163
I picture him starting up sex with

29:59.165 --> 30:01.965
"Good night, and good luck."

30:08.673 --> 30:10.808
I'd probably laugh so much

30:10.810 --> 30:13.143
that I'd have an orgasm
right then and there.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.182
From the laughter, you know?

30:18.184 --> 30:21.385
I lied about not seeing
"The Sixth Sense."

30:21.387 --> 30:24.421
Of course I saw it. Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.790
Who didn't see
"The Sixth Sense?"

30:26.792 --> 30:29.159
Why would you lie about that?

30:30.563 --> 30:33.564
I read in a woman's magazine
that every relationship

30:33.566 --> 30:35.599
whether it be short term, or long term

30:35.601 --> 30:37.901
there's usually, like, one big lie
relative to that relationship

30:37.903 --> 30:41.338
and I just... I wanted to get
mine over with, I guess.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.408
Why would you want to get a
jump start on the lying?

30:44.410 --> 30:45.475
Because...

30:45.477 --> 30:47.211
Because of five minutes from now.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.246
Well, yeah...

30:49.248 --> 30:51.782
You're assuming that
we're in a relationship

30:51.784 --> 30:54.651
or going to be when
I'm still technically on a date

30:54.653 --> 30:56.086
with someone else.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.121
Which I should probably be
getting back to. by the way.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.490
What about the handshake? We shook hands.
You can't do that.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.626
I was leading you on.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.928
That's really fucked up.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.763
That's the business.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.131
Well, what about a friendship?

31:08.133 --> 31:09.666
Actually, what am I talking about?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.969
I definitely don't want
to be friends with you.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.575
I was raped. In high school.

31:18.577 --> 31:22.012
By the quarterback...
of the football team.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.248
Jesus.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.849
I know.

31:25.851 --> 31:28.385
That is a terrible lie.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.420
Hey! How do you know
that's a lie?

31:30.422 --> 31:31.989
You were raped in high school

31:31.991 --> 31:33.790
by the quarterback of the football team?

31:33.792 --> 31:35.626
I don't think after-school
specials are that cliched.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.395
You couldn't have gone with, like,
a cornerback or defensive end

31:38.397 --> 31:39.897
or something?

31:39.899 --> 31:42.499
Well, I was just trying
to get mine over with.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.534
- Get what over who?
- My lie to you.

31:44.536 --> 31:45.969
- You can't.
- Why can't?

31:45.971 --> 31:49.673
Because I saw it coming,
because we just talked about it.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.743
You've got to wait until I'm in a
completely vulnerable position

31:52.745 --> 31:54.912
where I'd really fall for it.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.380
That sounds really dangerous.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.115
Oh, yeah, that's the problem
with relationships.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.283
Danger?

31:59.285 --> 32:00.984
- Or worse.
- Worse?

32:00.986 --> 32:03.921
You could change the other person.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.189
You're a very broken man, Dell.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.424
In theory.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.862
Speaking of broken men,
your goateed Philistine

32:11.864 --> 32:13.463
<i>is sashaying towards us.</i>

32:17.001 --> 32:18.201
- Run!
- What?

32:18.203 --> 32:19.236
- Run!
- What?

32:19.238 --> 32:20.470
<i>Run!</i>

32:36.021 --> 32:37.454
Well, that's settled.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.224
Wanna hit?

32:41.226 --> 32:45.095
No way. It has a weird
effect on me.

32:45.097 --> 32:48.598
For some reason, when I'm high,
I think people can't hear me

32:48.600 --> 32:50.801
and I start speaking really loudly.

32:52.937 --> 32:56.873
Do you remember memorizing phone numbers?

32:56.875 --> 33:00.277
I don't remember the last time
I memorized a phone number.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.512
I don't either, actually.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.082
Remember checking the newspaper
for movie showtimes?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.683
Remember that?

33:06.685 --> 33:09.653
Or writing people those notes in
those, like, folded-up triangles

33:09.655 --> 33:11.655
and then putting them in their lockers.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.692
Do you think kids still do that?

33:15.694 --> 33:17.561
As opposed to just e-mails or texts?

33:17.563 --> 33:20.197
No way. It's all about e-mails and texts

33:20.199 --> 33:22.366
with those goddamn hugs and kisses.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.334
I hate those things.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.169
Whenever anybody e-mails me hugs and kisses

33:26.171 --> 33:28.412
I wanna just e-mail them back
oral and penetration.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.811
Are we old? Are we
talking like old people?

33:36.247 --> 33:39.249
Are we on the verge of joining
the sweatpants culture?

33:46.724 --> 33:48.458
Was I just saying something?

33:50.361 --> 33:51.795
What? Was I?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.030
Give me that.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.798
- Why?
- Give me that.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.466
Okay, that's it for you.

33:57.735 --> 34:01.405
I think you should start
drinking some coffee.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.640
Okay?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.809
See, that's why I hate time.

34:57.228 --> 35:00.497
I believe I want to have sex with you now.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.632
I believe I share in that belief.

35:24.722 --> 35:28.458
Hey, uh, uh... Okay.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.161
We gotta get ready. Come on.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.763
What the F? I thought
we were gonna make it!

35:33.765 --> 35:35.699
I know, but we gotta go, Kim.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.100
Really.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.538
What's that?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.710
What is that?

35:54.118 --> 35:58.421
<i>You ordered Chinese food? Who
orders Chinese food in Paris?</i>

35:58.423 --> 36:00.891
Kim, they're going to have
dinner at the wedding, you know?

36:00.893 --> 36:03.326
<i>The wedding that we're supposed
to go to in half an hour.</i>

36:03.328 --> 36:05.729
<i>And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?</i>

36:05.731 --> 36:07.831
What does that have to do with anything?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.199
Oh, Jesus.
This is the pot talking.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.868
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it. You gotta get ready.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.237
What are you doing?
You made me promise

36:14.239 --> 36:15.939
to get you down there
on time no matter what.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.874
You warned me you would do this.

36:17.876 --> 36:21.845
See, this is why I hate time.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.514
I can't enjoy my sesame
chicken because of it.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.715
Kim.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.618
<i>Wish I could just stop it or something.</i>

36:28.620 --> 36:31.955
Or at least just make it
pause when needed, like now.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.624
Or better yet,
just get rid of it altogether.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.427
You wanna get rid of time?
How would you do that?

36:37.429 --> 36:39.362
<i>You know how there's time-based art?</i>

36:39.364 --> 36:41.998
Movies, music, plays,
it's all time-based art.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.668
There's a beginning,
and a middle and an end.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.571
You have to see it from
the beginning to the end.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.539
You're restrained to that timeline...

36:49.541 --> 36:52.142
<i>That way of experiencing it.</i>

36:52.144 --> 36:54.678
But then there's paintings.

36:54.680 --> 36:58.515
No beginning, no middle, no end.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.952
You see what you want to see
when you want to see it.

37:01.954 --> 37:05.355
No restrictions, it's just there.

37:05.357 --> 37:10.260
Okay, so you want life to be
a painting? Great.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.239
What?

37:28.112 --> 37:29.579
Thanks.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.715
So, do you know you really love me?

37:39.991 --> 37:41.524
So, what's in your pocket?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.360
My wallet.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.395
It's stuffed with our
saved movie ticket stubs

37:45.397 --> 37:46.930
because I'm a romantic like that.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.231
Can you please get ready?

37:48.233 --> 37:51.234
Shhh! Can't you see,
I'm trying to touch my toes?

37:51.236 --> 37:53.570
I really don't want to be that couple
that's always late for things.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.872
Can we please not be that couple?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.541
At least for the tenure
of our relationship? Please.

38:00.678 --> 38:02.579
You did it again!

38:02.581 --> 38:05.482
What? What, I'm just saying
I want us to respect time.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.717
<i>Not that.</i>

38:07.719 --> 38:11.521
Okay, what then? What did I do that
I did twice now and still not know?

38:11.523 --> 38:13.523
You said "the tenure
of our relationship."

38:13.525 --> 38:16.259
You keep speaking about our
relationship as if it's ending.

38:16.261 --> 38:18.962
Okay. You see how this
relates to the time thing?

38:18.964 --> 38:21.264
Why don't you take your own
advice and instead of seeing

38:21.266 --> 38:25.302
a beginning, middle, and end,
just see it as a painting.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.305
Kimberly! What are you doing?
We're going to be late!

38:28.307 --> 38:31.107
And I'm gonna somehow get
blamed for it, I know it.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.319
What are you reading?

38:42.321 --> 38:44.254
Roald Dahl short stories.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.193
So, is it about a girl?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.961
Is it about a new girl
you're going up north?

38:51.963 --> 38:53.229
A new girlfriend you're not telling me

38:53.231 --> 38:56.433
because you think it'll make it awkward...

38:57.234 --> 38:58.468
Yeah.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.572
So, right. Okay.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.908
New girl.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.544
I love Roald Dahl.
He's the best.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.546
Which one are you reading? And
are you sleeping with anyone?

39:09.548 --> 39:12.782
The one about Hitler. And yes.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.250
Shit.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.821
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.256
Uh... kind of.
It's about this doctor

39:20.258 --> 39:21.858
that saves this woman's life.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.060
<i>She's on the verge of death
through the whole delivery.</i>

39:24.062 --> 39:27.464
And this doctor is so determined
to save this woman's life

39:27.466 --> 39:29.265
and the life of her unborn child, right?

39:29.267 --> 39:32.402
But, it turns out that the child is Hitler.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.803
Okay, uh...

39:33.805 --> 39:35.839
Did you just give away the ending?

39:35.841 --> 39:37.393
How was I supposed to
tell you what the story

39:37.401 --> 39:38.775
was about without giving away the ending?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.777
What are you talking about?
Just say...

39:40.779 --> 39:43.346
It's a story about a
doctor who saves a woman

39:43.348 --> 39:44.914
from a potentially fatal pregnancy?

39:44.916 --> 39:46.516
- Because that's what the story is about.
- It is.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.685
False, birdbrain. That is not
what the story is about.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.588
It's about the irony
that the baby's Hitler.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.123
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.959
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy. Jack.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.694
You're seeing a Jack?

39:57.696 --> 39:59.362
<i>He's an executive at MTV.</i>

39:59.364 --> 40:02.365
Looks like a cross between
Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne

40:02.367 --> 40:05.101
from "A Different World," which is hot.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.003
That's a weird combination.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.877
I gotta go to the bathroom really quick.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.388
Well, that... fucking...

40:26.023 --> 40:27.223
Hurt.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.025
What?

40:29.027 --> 40:30.860
You hung up on me.
What happened?

40:30.862 --> 40:32.328
Because.

40:32.330 --> 40:35.131
Okay, you realize that's not
an answer to my question, right?

40:35.133 --> 40:37.200
What is it that I can help you with, sir?

40:37.202 --> 40:40.870
I don't know. Have I told you how much New
York reminds of why I hate L.A. so much?

40:40.872 --> 40:43.840
No, please do, because the
New Yorker who opines

40:43.842 --> 40:46.776
the inferiorities of Los Angeles
is bursting with originality.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.111
<i>I'm serious, Kimberly</i>

40:48.113 --> 40:50.580
we gotta move here, it is the fucking best.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.515
It's enough already with L.A.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.651
It's like a mix of moral
nihilism and Disneyland.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.553
So are you.

40:56.555 --> 41:01.057
Hey, did I tell you the proof of concept
on our drug passed with flying colors?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.393
There's actually a bidding war
between a few pharmas right now.

41:03.395 --> 41:06.475
Looks like we could be licensing
it for close to 25 million.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.598
Money for soul seems like...

41:08.600 --> 41:11.668
An even swap, yes,
it's not like I'm not happy for you

41:11.670 --> 41:14.571
but you did already tell me this
all this morning, remember?

41:14.573 --> 41:16.339
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.

41:16.341 --> 41:19.209
Oh shit, my short-term memory must be shot.

41:19.211 --> 41:21.110
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.213
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man

41:23.215 --> 41:25.248
aren't you supposed to be,
like, impressing me still?

41:25.250 --> 41:26.816
Your second-term boyfriend just told you

41:26.818 --> 41:29.552
he made his bosses close to
25 million dollars today.

41:29.554 --> 41:32.322
I'm not materialistic.

41:32.324 --> 41:34.691
I know that, but 25 million dollars

41:34.693 --> 41:37.961
sort of, I don't know,
makes that sound retarded.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.563
Okay, seeing as there's no
new information in this call

41:40.565 --> 41:43.700
I am going to go.
I'm almost at the gun range.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.603
Hey, don't you think it's cute that you
own a gun card and I own a pot card?

41:46.605 --> 41:48.938
<i>Now you sound retarded.</i>

41:48.940 --> 41:50.940
Listen, we should probably
stop saying retarded.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.475
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.444
Oh, is that just now starting?

41:57.615 --> 42:00.283
What's going on? You sound off.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.851
You're off.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.087
<i>No, no, no, I'm serious.</i>

42:04.089 --> 42:06.256
<i>Your cadence is all over the place.</i>

42:06.258 --> 42:08.057
You sound a little like Miss Teschmacher

42:08.059 --> 42:10.059
when she betrayed Lex Luthor.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.861
Something's wrong, I can tell.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.566
What's going on?

42:17.968 --> 42:20.236
Oh, God, this is gonna blow.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.905
What's going on?

42:22.940 --> 42:25.241
Oh, shit, this is bad, isn't it?

42:26.844 --> 42:28.845
This is like infidelity bad.

42:31.482 --> 42:34.183
I definitely heard a silence just now!

42:34.185 --> 42:36.119
What is going on?!

42:41.425 --> 42:42.625
You okay?

42:42.627 --> 42:43.993
Yeah, you okay?

42:45.129 --> 42:48.264
So... it's been a while.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.866
Yup.

42:51.635 --> 42:54.304
- I'm glad you're finally here.
- Yeah, me too.

42:59.643 --> 43:03.212
I've been trying to get a hold
of you for a long time now.

43:04.648 --> 43:06.683
Do you want a tour of the place?

43:06.685 --> 43:07.884
No.

43:07.886 --> 43:09.285
Oh, okay.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.422
Seriously?

43:12.424 --> 43:15.545
Oh, yeah. You know I don't care
about stupid shit like that.

43:19.196 --> 43:22.165
<i>Right, sorry,
I've adjusted to normal people</i>

43:22.167 --> 43:24.233
so your presence is gonna
take some realignment.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.835
You moving?

43:25.837 --> 43:29.539
Uh, no, kind... kind of.

43:29.541 --> 43:32.775
Um, do you want anything,
by the way? Like, uh...

43:32.777 --> 43:34.277
I want to talk.

43:48.058 --> 43:49.325
What?

43:52.963 --> 43:54.864
Nothing, for a second I...

43:56.166 --> 43:57.800
I forgot what you looked like.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.908
For the record,
I've never forgotten what you looked like.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.346
Okay, chill out, okay.
I didn't sleep with anyone!

44:10.348 --> 44:13.950
Okay, did you see and/or touch
another man's penis in any way?

44:13.952 --> 44:16.019
<i>Really? Out of all the
things you want to know</i>

44:16.021 --> 44:17.854
<i>this is what you wanna ask me the most?</i>

44:17.856 --> 44:20.790
What kinda question is that. Of course
that's what I want to know the most!

44:20.792 --> 44:22.592
No. Penises were not involved.

44:22.594 --> 44:24.360
Were your boobs and/or vagina...

44:24.362 --> 44:29.365
No. It was texts.
That's all it was.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.101
I should never have gone
against my own advice.

44:32.103 --> 44:34.604
I should always be the better
looking one in the relationship

44:34.606 --> 44:35.972
but I just sort of hit an impasse on that.

44:35.974 --> 44:38.307
Honestly, gosh, Dell,
do you really think that that...

44:38.309 --> 44:39.776
<i>Who was it?</i>

44:45.683 --> 44:49.852
It was my in-between ex... Jack.

44:49.854 --> 44:53.456
Jack, the MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?

44:53.458 --> 44:55.191
I thought you hated MTV!

44:55.193 --> 44:56.993
Isn't he short?

44:56.995 --> 44:58.661
He's not tall.

44:58.663 --> 45:00.463
Wha... Are you seriously
defending him?

45:00.465 --> 45:03.099
You can't call him short, you
have to go with "not tall?"

45:03.101 --> 45:05.468
Jesus, you like him?
Why the fuck are you being

45:05.470 --> 45:07.336
<i>so sangfroid over this shit?</i>

45:07.338 --> 45:09.405
<i>You're being way too easy on yourself!</i>

45:12.276 --> 45:15.378
You should know I'm standing in the
middle of a monsoon right now.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.381
Well... so, maybe I should
let you go then?

45:18.383 --> 45:20.550
Why? Because I'm standing
in the middle of a monsoon?

45:20.552 --> 45:23.319
No, because you...
Yes, because you're standing

45:23.321 --> 45:24.987
in the middle of a monsoon!

45:29.293 --> 45:30.893
Um...

45:35.499 --> 45:36.999
Are you okay?

45:37.001 --> 45:38.701
What are you staring at?

45:44.408 --> 45:46.375
<i>Oh, my thesis.</i>

45:48.879 --> 45:53.382
<i>That reminds me. I've been
keeping articles about you.</i>

45:53.384 --> 45:56.018
<i>They said that your drug
led to major breakthroughs</i>

45:56.020 --> 45:59.622
<i>in cancer treatment.
It's amazing, Dell.</i>

45:59.624 --> 46:01.924
Your mom, especially, must be proud.

46:06.663 --> 46:08.431
- That's me and...
- Jack.

46:10.534 --> 46:13.536
How long have you guys been engaged?

46:13.538 --> 46:16.005
So... what are you
talking about?

46:16.007 --> 46:18.608
You've boxed up a lot of old
kitchen appliances over there

46:18.610 --> 46:20.109
which means you've either declared a fatwa

46:20.111 --> 46:22.411
on General Electric or you're
wedding registering the fuck

46:22.413 --> 46:23.946
out of your friends and family.

46:23.948 --> 46:26.983
You've been fidgeting with
your ring finger non-stop.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.785
You're also giving me that look
like you're trying to think

46:28.787 --> 46:30.453
of a lie real quick.

46:32.389 --> 46:34.423
I might beat the shit out of you.

46:35.926 --> 46:37.927
The wedding's in a few weeks.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.942
Question is, where's the ring?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.166
It's getting sized.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.101
Huh?

46:45.103 --> 46:47.170
Question number two,
why didn't you tell me?

46:47.172 --> 46:48.704
I was going to tell you

46:48.706 --> 46:50.506
before you did your whole
annoying MacGyver thing.

46:50.508 --> 46:52.842
I don't think that's the
reference you're looking for.

46:52.844 --> 46:54.710
Does Jack even know I'm here?

46:54.712 --> 46:56.846
Trust me, he knows you're here.

46:56.848 --> 46:59.315
What does that mean?
Why did you scoff?

46:59.317 --> 47:01.617
What scoff? I didn't scoff.

47:01.619 --> 47:02.885
You scoffed.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.867
You guys fought about me coming.

47:07.925 --> 47:10.760
I'm actually kind of flattered,
didn't know yours truly

47:10.762 --> 47:13.129
could threaten the evil
prince of the MTV generation.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.064
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.366
His article in Esquire was
optioned by George Clooney.

47:17.368 --> 47:19.468
Yeah, well,
I won my fantasy baseball league last year.

47:19.470 --> 47:21.237
Let's not talk about Jack, okay?

47:21.239 --> 47:24.373
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?

47:24.375 --> 47:28.177
Is he making a face? Is that...
That's just how he looks.

47:30.547 --> 47:35.284
So, I had a very vivid dream
the other night about us.

47:35.286 --> 47:39.922
A vivid dream? What was
it about, this vivid dream?

47:41.558 --> 47:43.392
<i>It was a dream of memories.</i>

47:43.394 --> 47:45.795
<i>'Uh, conversations
that we've had.'</i>

47:46.997 --> 47:49.365
<i>'I saved your life.'</i>

47:49.367 --> 47:52.568
You owe the person that saved you,
don't you think?

47:52.570 --> 47:56.572
You had a dream that was
really a series of memories

47:56.574 --> 47:58.608
of conversations we've had?

47:58.610 --> 48:01.210
Yeah, don't hurt yourself,
it's not that complicated.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.879
<i>Cause to the brain,
there's no difference between</i>

48:02.881 --> 48:04.747
reality and dreams.

48:04.749 --> 48:07.083
They were just memories
of us over the years.

48:08.518 --> 48:09.819
What if I don't subscribe

48:09.821 --> 48:11.854
to a culture of indentured servitude?

48:11.856 --> 48:16.359
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature

48:16.361 --> 48:18.060
it's here to stay.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.695
They weaved in and out of each other

48:19.697 --> 48:22.098
like those
M.C. Escher drawings.

48:22.100 --> 48:24.133
So, one second I'd be on that train

48:24.135 --> 48:27.570
that time we got back together
after our first breakup

48:27.572 --> 48:30.172
another second
I was on the phone in New York.

48:33.644 --> 48:36.812
The last time we ever talked to each other.

48:36.814 --> 48:39.482
But they blended together like a...

48:39.484 --> 48:41.083
<i>Painting?</i>

48:41.085 --> 48:43.019
I saved your life.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.354
If it weren't for me,
you would have been run over

48:45.356 --> 48:46.923
by that car.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.758
<i>You would have been splat</i>

48:48.760 --> 48:51.727
just like my timeless life painting thing.

48:53.497 --> 48:55.698
And they were all real...

48:55.700 --> 48:58.768
But there was one moment in
the dream that was, um...

49:00.137 --> 49:01.938
Well, it... it...
it was one we never had,

49:01.940 --> 49:04.407
it was the only one.

49:04.409 --> 49:07.209
<i>What was it about?
This made-up moment?</i>

49:07.211 --> 49:10.212
It's gonna sound weird,
but it was us talking

49:10.214 --> 49:13.249
after not having talked for however long.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.484
<i>So, wait, I'm confused.
It was...</i>

49:15.486 --> 49:18.955
This moment. This moment
that we're having right now.

49:18.957 --> 49:21.590
So me coming over, seeing your
apartment, your life with Jack

49:21.592 --> 49:23.225
and reconnecting...

49:31.568 --> 49:34.403
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.526
This is what happens when you fall
in love in Los Angeles. Fuck!

49:39.676 --> 49:42.578
So, what is this? Are you
breaking up with me?

49:42.580 --> 49:44.113
<i>I don't want to, no.</i>

49:44.115 --> 49:46.549
But you like this Jack guy, right?

49:46.551 --> 49:49.251
Do you realize Jack Tripper was one of
my favorite characters in all of fiction

49:49.253 --> 49:51.754
and you've forever ruined his good name?

49:51.756 --> 49:53.022
Shit! Can I...

49:53.024 --> 49:55.157
Shit, I can't even order
a Jack and Coke anymore!

49:55.159 --> 49:56.926
A vodka soda!

49:56.928 --> 49:59.695
A vodka soda?
My life is ruined!

49:59.697 --> 50:02.164
Okay. We should just
get off the phone, okay.

50:02.166 --> 50:06.002
You're mad, and any words we exchange
now are gonna be bleak at best...

50:06.004 --> 50:08.637
I can't believe this. You used to
never want to get off the phone.

50:08.639 --> 50:11.440
No, I used to want to get off
the phone, I just used to not.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.142
And now you can't <i> wait
</i> to get off the phone.

50:13.144 --> 50:15.511
<i>I don't even know what we're
fighting about anymore, okay.</i>

50:15.513 --> 50:17.646
If you wanna yell at me about
Jack, fine, but I'm too tired

50:17.648 --> 50:20.049
for another one of your meta arguments.

50:20.051 --> 50:22.418
I don't deserve to be treated like this.

50:22.420 --> 50:24.453
<i>I thought you were supposed
to be my indentured servant?</i>

50:24.455 --> 50:26.055
<i>Whatever happened to that, huh?</i>

50:26.057 --> 50:27.923
So, what are you talking about right now?

50:27.925 --> 50:30.459
<i>I'm talking about that-that
prescription to life thing.</i>

50:30.461 --> 50:33.529
Right, except it's subscription to nature.

50:33.531 --> 50:34.864
Whatever.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.266
No, you have this backwards,
kid, I saved your life.

50:37.268 --> 50:38.968
<i>But then I saved your life.</i>

50:38.970 --> 50:41.537
When were on the train, we ran into
each other, and we got back together.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.873
You mean, when you stalked and
followed me onto the train?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.508
<i>I saved your life because
you got off at Chico.</i>

50:45.510 --> 50:46.642
<i>You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.</i>

50:46.644 --> 50:47.943
You were supposed to go on to Portland,

50:47.945 --> 50:49.645
but because of me you got
off at Chico instead

50:49.647 --> 50:51.168
and you weren't on the
train when it derailed.

50:51.194 --> 50:51.847
You could have died.

50:51.849 --> 50:53.716
<i>No one died, Dell.</i>

50:53.718 --> 50:54.884
The point remains...

50:54.886 --> 50:56.652
No, that's not the same, okay.

50:56.654 --> 50:59.221
You would absolutely have
died had I not saved you.

50:59.223 --> 51:02.591
Plus, I saw that car coming. I knew it
was going to hit you, and I saved you.

51:02.593 --> 51:04.260
I knowingly saved you.

51:04.262 --> 51:07.430
Yeah, well, that's starting to
feel like a minus, not a plus.

51:07.432 --> 51:09.732
Be that as it may,
you didn't know you were saving me.

51:09.734 --> 51:11.534
You were just trying to
get back in my pants.

51:11.536 --> 51:14.136
No! I was trying
to get you back!

51:14.138 --> 51:16.072
Which just happens to include
getting into your pants.

51:16.074 --> 51:19.108
So yours was a sinister doing,
mine was pure altruism.

51:19.110 --> 51:21.510
But I knowingly saved you too.

51:21.512 --> 51:23.412
We just went over this, pothead...

51:23.414 --> 51:25.881
You were supposed to get off
at Portland to meet Jack

51:25.883 --> 51:28.084
but I knowingly saved you from him.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.154
Except I didn't, did I?

51:43.266 --> 51:44.733
Fuck!

51:53.210 --> 51:55.077
I should have told you I loved you more.

51:55.079 --> 51:57.446
When we were together, I mean.

51:57.448 --> 51:59.915
<i>I was also such a dick to you</i>

51:59.917 --> 52:01.717
but I thought you'd find it
endearing for some reason

52:01.719 --> 52:06.455
like... like people feel about
Don Rickles or Mussolini.

52:06.457 --> 52:09.525
It's not an excuse, it's just a reason.

52:09.527 --> 52:11.193
Anyway, I'm sorry, okay.

52:19.136 --> 52:22.104
I need a drink. In a bad way.

52:22.106 --> 52:25.174
There's a bar car here,
they sell drinks. Let's go.

52:25.176 --> 52:28.711
No, doesn't that mean we have
to walk in between the cars?

52:28.713 --> 52:30.246
No, I can't do that while
the train's moving.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.615
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
- Said the dick.

52:32.617 --> 52:34.416
Besides, the world's at war right
now, so I think we should...

52:34.418 --> 52:37.253
We should take every little opportunity
to put ourselves in harm's way.

52:37.255 --> 52:39.054
Alleviate some of the guilt, you know?

52:39.056 --> 52:42.791
No, no, there's all the scary
noises that the train makes

52:42.793 --> 52:44.226
and what if I fell?

52:44.228 --> 52:46.095
I don't have the best
relationship with gravity.

52:46.097 --> 52:48.330
Put your iPod on and play something calming

52:48.332 --> 52:49.632
that'll drown out the sound,

52:49.634 --> 52:52.935
and I'll hold your hand.
So you don't fall.

52:52.937 --> 52:56.105
Come on. Come on.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.189
I won't let you go. I promise.

Have you ever tried asking someone

55:02.933 --> 55:06.368
"Where's my fucking money?"
You ever done that?

55:06.370 --> 55:09.071
You mean, at random,
or when I'm actually owed money?

55:09.073 --> 55:10.539
No, at random obviously.

55:10.541 --> 55:12.641
Right, I don't know what I was thinking.

55:12.643 --> 55:14.810
It's fun, you should
try it. Ask me.

55:17.248 --> 55:19.415
Ask me where's my fucking money?

55:22.819 --> 55:25.087
Where's my fucking money?

55:25.089 --> 55:26.889
Where's my fucking money?

55:26.891 --> 55:30.592
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money!

55:30.594 --> 55:33.162
If I don't get my fucking
money right fucking now...

55:33.164 --> 55:37.032
Where's my goddamn money, you motherfucker?

55:38.835 --> 55:40.336
What the fuck?

55:44.908 --> 55:46.141
Jesus.

55:47.577 --> 55:49.211
That was really fun.

55:54.784 --> 55:56.785
Wait. It's just that...

55:56.787 --> 55:59.822
Say what you were going to say,
and then, after you say it

55:59.824 --> 56:01.957
maybe we should, like,
not talk for a minute.

56:01.959 --> 56:05.227
You know, like, let a whole minute
pass by without saying something.

56:05.229 --> 56:07.093
But go ahead and say
what you were gonna say

56:07.119 --> 56:08.774
and then we can start right after that.

56:10.834 --> 56:12.901
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.

56:44.801 --> 56:48.837
So, wait, you're saying you
dreamt this conversation?

56:48.839 --> 56:50.939
A conversation that didn't
take place until now?

56:50.941 --> 56:53.542
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of
conversations, including this one

56:53.544 --> 56:57.146
which led me to come here,
because it made me think

56:57.148 --> 56:59.181
about how much I regretted...

57:01.351 --> 57:03.419
Do you regret meeting me, Dell?

57:04.454 --> 57:07.156
No, of course not.

57:07.158 --> 57:10.192
I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.

57:10.194 --> 57:13.362
Before you, I only dated guys
that looked good on paper.

57:13.364 --> 57:15.097
Yeah.

57:16.132 --> 57:17.499
Wait, what?

57:17.501 --> 57:19.835
You were really, really smart,

57:19.837 --> 57:23.138
but also selfish, crass...

57:23.140 --> 57:25.574
Not always in an
entertaining way, mind you.

57:25.576 --> 57:28.243
You hated your job and life

57:28.245 --> 57:31.313
and you were completely
comfortable being miserable.

57:31.315 --> 57:34.883
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.

57:36.486 --> 57:39.721
Being with you made me realize it...

57:39.723 --> 57:42.658
Doesn't have to look good
on paper to feel good.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.638
- What kind of sandwich...
- PB and J.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.140
Of course.

58:00.977 --> 58:03.045
- What's your favorite word?
- Comet.

58:04.414 --> 58:06.348
- "Comet?"
- Right.

58:08.318 --> 58:13.689
Not like "proliferate," "ensconce"

58:13.691 --> 58:16.625
"kerfuffle," or "serendipity."

58:17.227 --> 58:18.827
"Comet?" Like...

58:23.366 --> 58:24.466
"comet?"

58:25.268 --> 58:26.969
Yeah. Exactly like that.

58:28.271 --> 58:31.373
What about your least favorite word?

58:31.375 --> 58:34.276
I don't strongly dislike any word.

58:34.278 --> 58:36.879
I sort of have a love-hate
relationship with the word

58:36.881 --> 58:39.781
"fingerfuck," but that's
technically two words

58:39.783 --> 58:42.184
and I like each one separately.

58:48.291 --> 58:52.394
So, do you ever wish you could,
like, control society

58:52.396 --> 58:54.062
for a couple of minutes?

58:54.064 --> 58:56.732
Like make them all hate MTV or something?

58:56.734 --> 58:59.868
I don't think MTV is as
important as you think it is.

59:01.604 --> 59:05.007
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.

59:05.009 --> 59:08.143
It's like a drug which you
get hooked on at age twelve

59:08.145 --> 59:11.480
that you can't wake up from until
you're probably, like, thirty

59:11.482 --> 59:13.849
when you finally realize
how awful it really was.

59:13.851 --> 59:15.584
But by then, it's too late.

59:15.586 --> 59:17.386
They've, like, won.

59:17.388 --> 59:18.820
You've watched all their commercials

59:18.822 --> 59:20.389
during their week's sweep.

59:20.391 --> 59:22.024
I believe it's "sweeps week."

59:25.828 --> 59:27.930
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.

59:27.932 --> 59:30.399
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.

59:33.169 --> 59:35.070
You think you've won me.

59:36.740 --> 59:39.107
I can't believe you think
you've won me already.

59:39.109 --> 59:42.578
Are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man

59:42.580 --> 59:45.013
to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.851
You're so wrong, my friend.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.341
Holy shit.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.011
You are so easily amused.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:20.148
<i>Cause of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.</i>

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.285
Louis L'Amour is her favorite
novelist, so, here we are.

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.956
You know I just realized. I
don't even know why we're here.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.858
I don't even like Sarah.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.127
Fire.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.763
Just let me have this, and then we'll go.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.840
What are you doing?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.154
This feels like a dream...

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:18.607
I love it when you look out windows.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.048
Sir...

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:28.410
Did you damage the bathroom
about thirty minutes ago?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.156
Well, I'm obviously going
to tell you that I didn't.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.461
- Sir.
- What?

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:42.798
I'm gonna have to ask you to
get off at the next stop.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.167
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:46.802
Okay.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:49.271
- You got me?
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.243
I don't even wanna ask.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.679
Looks like our little
tryst is about to end.

01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.248
Get off at Chico with me, please. We
can have an hour to two hour talk.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.050
And then if you want, I'll get
you another ticket to Portland.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:05.187
An hour to two hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.589
Well, I'm not meeting anyone so.

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:11.059
Wait, what?

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.196
There's no... girl.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.833
So, wha... what was this?

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:20.402
Just another one of your
stupid mind games, Dell?

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.705
Why did you lie? And what
happened to your hand?

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:26.508
You're always hiding things!
I'm sitting somewhere else.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.510
Now, listen, wait...
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:31.313
I'm sorry. I lied because I thought
it'd make it easier, okay?

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:32.948
- You thought it'd make it easier?
- Yeah.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:35.150
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.452
- Talking to you.
- Why would it make it easier?

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:40.856
Because I didn't think you'd talk to me
if you knew I was trying to get you back.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:44.226
So what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:46.828
Yes, it was. It was a whim
that turned into a plan.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.131
How did you even know I was on this train?

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.600
Because I've... I've...
I've stalked you.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.139
You could've called, Dell.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:00.075
- You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.110
You have my phone number,
you have my e-mail

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.679
but you haven't contacted me once,
not once in months.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.282
Just... Look, I know a great
public library in Chico

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.317
where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.686
You wanna go to a public library to talk?

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:12.821
That seems counter-intuitive.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.623
Well, they have a talking area.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.793
You happen to know of a public library
in Chico with a talking area?

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.494
Yeah.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.399
First, answer my question.

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:26.535
How come you never proposed?

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:28.436
Come on, Kim, you broke up with me.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.671
How come you didn't fight for me?

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.239
It felt like the end of days when you left.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.541
I ate Ramen for months.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:34.743
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
I barely got through it.

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:37.813
I didn't think I could do it again. Felt
like my fucking world was gonna blow.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:40.182
So me leaving you constitutes
your world blowing up?

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.516
Yes. It does actually.

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:42.884
<i>Next stop, Chico.</i>

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.187
Please, come on.

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.990
I want you to do this.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.898
Why wouldn't you want this forever?

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.702
I'd like for once to understand

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.238
why you wouldn't want this always.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.775
It's always as scary.

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.312
There's a finality to it.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.717
I just don't ever want you
to feel like a limitation.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.122
Okay, let me go a different way with it.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.024
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.727
<i>Cause you think they're gonna
hurt you even though they can't.</i>

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:27.629
Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:29.898
- They're both irrational.
- False on so many fronts.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.199
Why?

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.601
Girls are afraid of cockroaches

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:33.735
because they're gross

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:36.037
and they carry disease,
proven by the fact that

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:37.906
they were one of the biblical plagues.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.575
Also, they also love to
lay eggs in your vagina.

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.711
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:45.280
commitment can hurt you...

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:46.848
Because it can.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:58.793
Know that when a steal a girl's twenties...

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:00.829
It's dangerous business, buster.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.970
You're officially
on notice, Mr. Pink Lighter.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:14.743
- Duly noted, Mrs. Pink Lighter.
- Nope, can't call me that.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.812
You don't want to marry me, remember?

01:05:17.814 --> 01:05:19.981
I didn't say that.

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.118
Where's my phone?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.321
Where's my phone?
Where's my fuckin' phone?

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:42.037
Why don't I call it?

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.706
Why are you acting like that?

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.642
- Like what?
- Uncomfortable.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.244
In the two years we've known each other

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:50.912
I've rarely seen you uncomfortable.

01:05:50.914 --> 01:05:53.181
<i>I... I'm not.</i>

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:55.450
You are.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.952
You're hiding something from me.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:59.387
<i>Ah, God, you just got too stoned, Kimberly</i>

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.089
<i>And I thought we were going
after your last cigarette.</i>

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.757
- <i>What're you doing?</i>
- What're you hiding?

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:05.260
- You know something?
- <i>There's no "something."</i>

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:06.695
<i>You just got too high.</i>

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:08.196
You best motherfucking
believe there's a something.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.531
There's always a something.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:11.566
Okay? This is not the first
time I've felt that.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.168
- <i>Felt what?</i>
- You...

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.703
Saying something like you've slipped.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:16.071
<i>I didn't slip...</i>

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:18.640
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.576
<i>You know what? You're actually
starting to freak me out.</i>

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:21.476
<i>There's nothing going on.</i>

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.345
Well, it's about time you're freaked.

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:26.881
Okay. I hate always feeling like
the freak in this relationship!

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.283
<i>Why're you doing this?</i>

01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:30.518
Because there's something
you're not telling me.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.088
Okay. I know you, and I know
when you get uncomfortable.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.889
And it's so rare that I've formed

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:37.392
an acute discomfort detector on you.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.594
Now, are you gonna tell me what it
is or are you going to force me

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:42.030
to be late to my own annoying
friend's Louis L'Amour

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:45.333
goddamn western-themed wedding?

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:54.142
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.357
Hey. Kim.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.662
Look at me.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.931
Keep looking.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.741
You're right. You're right.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.177
There is something
I've been wanting to tell you.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.719
In the dream,
I told you I wanted to be with you.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.161
I wanted you to leave Jack and
to walk out the door with me.

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:45.794
Wow.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:52.267
- Do you feel that?
- What?

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.472
<i>Okay, calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.</i>

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.908
<i>Let's go up to the rooftop.</i>

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.743
So, what else happens in this dream?

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:04.212
Do I... Do I go with you?

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.247
All happily ever after and the like?

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:09.484
Or do I slap you and tell you to be gone.

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:11.853
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.788
and I went to kiss you

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.191
and before our lips touched, I woke up.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.761
<i>What?</i>

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:25.934
<i>Maybe I never saved you that night we met.</i>

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.636
<i>Maybe you did die, hit by that car.</i>

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:31.439
And this is just some afterlife fantasy

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.308
playing out in your head.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:36.511
- What?
- Something feels weird.

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:42.317
Remember how I used to love
flipping the pillow over

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.952
to feel the cold side?

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.854
Yeah.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.791
That's what our relationship felt like.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.660
Constant tossing and turning

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.828
looking for that perfect balance.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:58.700
Sometimes it was there, and other times...

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.602
I know, I know.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:06.241
You always expected us to break up.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.642
Why was that?

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.004
Is that because of your dumb
five-minutes-from-now rule?

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.281
You know, after we stopped talking

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.816
the five-minute rule started shrinking.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:19.120
It went to four minutes,
to three, then two, then one...

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:24.792
Let's go up to
the rooftop. Come on.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.330
I thought my unconscious was trying
to tell me something, you know.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.666
By dreaming that dream a few nights ago.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.635
Coming here, talking to you.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:36.904
That might close the gap, that last minute.

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.410
Or...

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:44.812
Or none of this is really happening.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.385
This could still be your dream.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.220
♪ <i>Dum dum dum</i> ♪♪

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.792
Fuck!

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.460
What? What happened?

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:02.397
<i>Fuckin' bird carcass on my windshield!</i>

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:05.400
What? Okay. Slow down,
tell me what's going on.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:06.968
I'm saying a fucking bird just

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.804
committed suicide on my windshield!

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:13.841
<i>What? In the middle
of our conversation?</i>

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:16.411
What is our conversation
have to do with anything?

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:18.146
It must mean something.

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:19.948
It must mean
that the... that the...

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.350
Maybe the bird was
commenting on our situation.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.885
Commenting?

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.688
You think this is commentary?

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.089
Definitely, I mean,
it's something, the universe

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:31.392
cosmos, all that,
via the bird, sent us a signal.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.827
Yeah.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.462
Okay.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:37.332
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully. Okay?

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.267
Okay, you're gonna be mean.
Aren't you?

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:42.036
On this already horrible call,
you're gonna be mean on top of it.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:45.440
<i>You are very, very, very...</i>

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:47.609
You know what?
I can't even say "very" enough

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:50.645
so just imagine an infinite
number of "verys." Okay?

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:52.747
Well, I don't have that
kind of imagination.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.716
I barely picture odd numbered things.

01:10:54.718 --> 01:10:56.351
Well, freakin' try, okay?

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:59.220
<i>Cause that number of "verys" precedes sick.</i>

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:01.756
Sick. S-I-C-K.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.558
Told you you were gonna be mean.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.427
And condescending,
as if I didn't know how to spell sick.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:09.330
You are not being a nice person right now!

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:26.881
So, I'm at the gun range.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.819
This is a nightmare.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:35.657
Sartre was right,
"Hell is other people."

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:38.860
I should go, I've got my goggles on.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.895
<i>You did this on purpose, didn't you?</i>

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:44.365
You wanted me to find out when
I was three thousand miles away.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:45.967
You were telegraphing all the signs

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.669
like you were Samuel fucking Morse.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:51.472
You wanted me to know. That's
the part that hurts the most.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.241
<i>Why would I want that?</i>

01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:55.677
Because maybe your
feelings for him are real.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.716
How long has it been going on?

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.855
- About a month.
- <i>A month! Oh shit!</i>

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.991
<i>I'm so sorry for interrupting
the honeymoon period.</i>

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.560
I hear those are the best
parts of a relationship.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:15.129
I-I'm gonna go, okay,
I've got my goggles on...

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:17.932
Yes, I fucking heard you.
Enough with the goggles already!

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.234
Jesus Christ! How're you
gonna get off the phone

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:22.036
and just go about your day after this, huh?

01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:23.839
Because I don't think all
of our conversations

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840
need to necessarily feel good.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.175
<i>They should feel bad then?</i>

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:29.577
They should be whatever the
conversation should...

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:32.246
I don't know. Why are you
analyzing this so much?

01:12:32.248 --> 01:12:33.815
<i>Oh, I'm not analyzing you yet.</i>

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.950
I'm just giving you my
initial gut reaction.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.286
Can I please get off the phone with you

01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:39.654
and not feel like shit...

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:41.489
You hurt me!

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:48.062
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:59.407
I wanna break up with you.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.275
I don't love you.

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:04.512
Dell, that's not what you want to say...

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:10.451
That is what I want
to say actually. I don't...

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.453
I don't love you, Kimberly.

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:15.790
Honestly,
I don't know if I ever really did.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.759
<i>And you definitely didn't.</i>

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.061
If you're capable of making
choices that knowingly hurts

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.997
the other person, that's not love.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.433
Okay, you're mad, you're mad...

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.571
How can you say that?

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.607
<i>Reality is I could have
met any number of girls</i>

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.475
<i>to be with for a few years.</i>

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.913
That was your lie. Alright?

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.515
<i>Texting Jack behind my back.</i>

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:42.383
<i>It came when I least expected it.</i>

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.585
I fell for it hook, line and sinker

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.387
and it fucking hurts.

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:48.489
That was your lie.

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:50.792
- Bravo.
- <i>Okay, fine.</i>

01:13:50.794 --> 01:13:52.894
You wanna hurt me?
You wanna be right?

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:54.996
Fine, go ahead. Be right.

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.798
All I ever wanted was the truth.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.866
No, no, you wanna be right.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:00.501
<i>No. Truth is not
what you're after.</i>

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:03.070
<i>Because if you wanted the truth,
then you would have to accept</i>

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:04.153
<i>the fact that I do...</i>

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.354
Who is this?

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:22.490
<i>I'm sorry, is this Dell?</i>

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.426
- Who's this?
- <i>Yes, hi. This is Nancy.</i>

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:28.830
<i>I'm your mother's nurse.
We met a few times.</i>

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.565
Yeah.

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:34.068
<i>I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.</i>

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.003
<i>Your mother passed away.</i>

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:39.407
What? That's impossible.

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:41.242
She's been okay for years now.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.244
Her cancer's been in remission.

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:46.013
<i>She had a heart attack.</i>

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.349
Heart attack? Why?

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.620
<i>Sometimes these things just happen.</i>

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.529
<i>This feels strange.</i>

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.300
<i>Not what I expected my train
ride to feel like at all.</i>

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.205
What were you expecting?

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:17.945
I was expecting to read that short story.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.113
The Roald Dahl one?

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.148
You already read it though.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.851
You know the ending.

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.556
Sometimes it's not about
knowing the ending.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.067
It can't be the same like
it was the last time.

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.403
It has to be different or we'll
wind up right where we started.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:45.206
I know. I know.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.975
I promise you a change.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.944
I promise, okay?

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.785
You know,
I'm falling out of love with you, right?

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:00.254
Just shut up for a second, please.

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.259
What do you wanna tell me, Dell?

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:07.962
Kimberly...

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:14.035
I used to find it annoying when
you said "so" all the time.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.837
It bugged the shit out of me.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.373
And I love it.

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.342
I love it now.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:23.844
After we have sex and you
shrug your shoulders

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:25.947
and you say,
"I'm here all week."

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:27.715
I love that.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.817
I love that a single strand
of your hair can fall

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.453
so perfectly to the side,
and you don't even know.

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.792
I love the little blue
veins behind your eyes.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:40.995
I love your eyes.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:42.663
Knowing you goes down as easily

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:45.900
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:48.135
Easily.

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:50.705
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:52.273
but nobody could order you

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:56.711
because I'd just want you to be mine,
just all mine.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:59.080
Not in the biblical, slavery-owning sense

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:02.283
or, uh, the pimp-prostitute dynamic of,

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:05.953
"You be mine, bitch!"
but... but, just in that...

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.924
You're my love. You're my love.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.794
But my favorite thing of all.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:18.199
I like you because you like me.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.336
I think that says a lot about

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.179
how great you are as a person.

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.715
<i>So, um...</i>

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:39.754
<i>Dell.</i>

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.029
Believe me.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:50.264
Believe me when I say...

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.035
You almost had me.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.832
<i>'Is that weird to imagine that one day'</i>

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:26.675
<i>'this will all be old to us?'</i>

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:34.642
This walk, us meeting.

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:36.844
It'll just be an old memory.

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.881
That sounds...

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.751
Sad.

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:11.779
Hey, I gotta ask you a really big question.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.821
I don't know if you can handle it.
It's... It's really big.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.154
What?

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.687
Forget it. It's stupid.

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.231
- What?
- <i>Forget it.</i>

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:31.932
It's a stupid joke. You'd probably
even figure it out by now.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.701
- Why would I know the joke?
- Because I've already said it.

01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:35.536
- When?
- Earlier in the conversation.

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:37.905
When? Hey, come on.
I'm so confused!

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:39.673
Sometimes I wanna stop
people on the streets...

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.275
Who? - Anybody, from
all walks of life.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.310
On their way to work,
to the gym, to school!

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:45.846
- I wanna stop them all, grab them
like I'm grabbing you right now.
- Right now?

01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:47.114
Right now.
I wanna look right into their eyes

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:50.184
and I wanna ask them one simple question.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:54.355
Where's my fucking money?

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.214
I think I'm going to fall
in love with you too.

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.149
- Are you crying?
- Shut up.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.542
<i>There's still my theory...</i>

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:52.947
<i>...that this is just
part of that strange dream.</i>

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:54.882
<i>And so...</i>

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:57.518
<i>...even if we do kiss,
you'll just wake up</i>

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.853
<i>and it'll all be over.</i>

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.090
This can't be a dream.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.992
What if it is?

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:15.402
What're you doing?

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.771
Something's wrong.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:20.307
I know it, Kimberly, I know you.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:22.443
You have circles under your eyes.

01:21:22.445 --> 01:21:25.346
You were the type of girl that
could sleep through wars.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.781
And despite that,
you're still looking so beautiful.

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:29.917
More beautiful than ever, in fact.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:32.219
It's usually a sign you wanna remind
the world that you're a sexual being

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.521
because your man's not
picking up the signal.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:36.991
You've checked out of this
relationship, haven't you?

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:38.859
You're not happy.

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:40.661
Also, you're listening to Roxette.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:42.963
I know that means the beginning of the end.

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:45.165
And let's get real for a second
about the ring, alright.

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:46.934
You're not having it sized.

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:49.203
I'm sure you had your ring-size
burned into Jack's memory years ago.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.538
Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.341
You didn't wear the ring because
you didn't want me to see it.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:57.978
Don't marry him, okay.
I want you back.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.547
I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:03.617
That's what you've been wanting
to say to me this whole time...

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:05.719
- Dell.
- What?

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:10.257
I'm pregnant.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.696
What?

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:18.365
Morning sickness has been keeping me up.

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.734
I just really love Roxette.

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:25.406
And I dressed this way not to
announce to the world anything.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:28.142
It was you.

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:30.277
I wanted to look good for you.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.647
Because no matter how bad
our relationship got

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:37.318
I wanted to say thank you from
the bottom of my heart for it.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.586
Because I needed it.

01:22:41.423 --> 01:22:43.691
I needed you in this life.

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:47.795
That's what I wanted to say.

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:55.069
I gotta... I gotta sit down.

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.413
I'm sorry.

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.719
I'm not leaving Jack.

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:14.588
I love him.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.563
Wow. You're pregnant.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.334
I didn't see that coming.

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:30.337
Do you know what it is yet?

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:33.607
Not yet. Hoping it's a girl.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.818
Uh, I almost proposed to you, you know?

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.925
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:54.028
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:57.431
I was about to give it to you,
and then I took it

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.334
and I flushed it down the toilet.

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:05.706
I keep replaying that moment
over and over again in my head.

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.545
Why are you crying?

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.818
I'm just happy to see you.

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:21.555
And it's such a beautiful night.

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:30.731
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:35.969
<i>Cause I don't belong in a world where
we don't end up together. I don't.</i>

01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:39.406
There are parallel universes out
there where this didn't happen.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.975
Where I was with you, and you were with me.

01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:43.277
And whatever universe that is

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:45.319
that's the one where my heart lives in.

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:52.719
I wanted so badly to go back into
that dream I had the other night.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.722
I tried so hard... to go
back to sleep.

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:06.733
You know, I never thought
love was real. I didn't.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.169
And now I think life isn't real without it.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.973
That sounds like a really
bad greeting card...

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:15.709
Don't. Don't make it a joke.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.816
Truth?

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.854
I think you always believed in love.

01:25:26.856 --> 01:25:28.822
This is so stupid.

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.059
So irrational.

01:25:32.061 --> 01:25:34.361
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:36.830
You fucking hate Pixar
movies for crying out loud.

01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:38.365
You still have an AOL account.

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:41.168
I don't wanna be with a person like that.

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:48.475
Why does it feel so
impossible to let you go?

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.981
It's an addiction, you know.
That's all it is.

01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:57.618
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.052
If you think about it

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:00.787
relationships are all totally narcissistic.

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:02.823
Basically, you're just looking
for someone who'll love you

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:04.358
as much as you love yourself.
That's all it is.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.093
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

01:26:06.095 --> 01:26:08.162
No, it's not.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:14.301
No, it's not.

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:18.906
I don't know anything anymore.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.976
But I know I do love you.

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:32.719
- Dell...
- Just give me a minute, okay.
