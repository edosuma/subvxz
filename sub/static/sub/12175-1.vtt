WEBVTT

01:11.208 --> 01:17.000
Through incessant rains
and scorching sun

01:17.583 --> 01:22.167
With the wind blowing strong

01:23.417 --> 01:29.542
Rising enmity make heads fall

01:29.708 --> 01:34.292
Life sometimes does cease

01:35.708 --> 01:46.625
Through day and night,
you protect us.

01:47.750 --> 01:58.667
You come in godly
forms, to guard us.

01:59.708 --> 02:04.500
Trees may collapse

02:06.125 --> 02:10.292
Seeds nurture life within

02:11.917 --> 02:21.000
Fall to rise and fight.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.583
Through mornings
that never starts

02:58.333 --> 03:01.000
Through days that never end

03:01.375 --> 03:07.042
You toil ever persistent

03:07.583 --> 03:12.875
There exists no state
Free of crimes till date

03:13.042 --> 03:17.375
Hunt them with a just view

03:19.667 --> 03:24.625
In your sleep...

03:31.208 --> 03:37.250
Vigilant even in your sleep

03:37.833 --> 03:43.208
Your methods stay
when you are gone

03:43.833 --> 03:48.750
Enormous works are done

03:49.833 --> 03:54.792
No one can replace the force

04:36.708 --> 04:38.250
Hey listen

04:38.500 --> 04:39.333
Shut up

04:39.667 --> 04:40.167
Don't irritate

04:40.333 --> 04:44.542
Had I married someone else
I would've been happier

04:44.792 --> 04:46.042
You keep quiet!

04:46.333 --> 04:46.875
Don’t raise your voice

04:47.042 --> 04:48.833
- I know what to do
- What do you know?

04:49.250 --> 04:50.542
- Don’t you...
- How dare...

04:50.667 --> 04:54.042
Mind your own business. Don’t you
poke your nose into my business.

04:54.208 --> 04:58.667
- How dare you...
- Don't you dare lay your hands on me.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.708
How dare you hit a woman?

05:05.042 --> 05:06.042
She is my wife

05:06.250 --> 05:07.625
Will you hit her in a public
place if she is wife?

05:07.792 --> 05:08.958
Hey. Tell him!

05:09.208 --> 05:10.292
He is my husband.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.833
Keep all your arguments at home.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.292
I'll have you arrested.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.667
Why are you here? Hey you!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.667
Where are you going?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.500
Easy! You hurt me!

05:36.500 --> 05:37.875
Tell me.

05:37.917 --> 05:38.792
Where are you?

05:39.542 --> 05:41.125
Don't harm him. Leave him.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.417
It's over.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.417
- Leave the place.
- Yes

05:46.042 --> 05:47.333
Come on. Let's leave.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.208
Listen to me.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.917
If I could do anything, I wouldn't
have let you talk this much.

06:33.250 --> 06:33.875
Just a moment

06:39.500 --> 06:40.000
Go now.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.167
Its beyond my control

06:45.875 --> 06:46.958
How many times have I told you?

06:47.458 --> 06:50.500
You burnt him there as though you
couldn't find a better place.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.000
All that is fine.

06:53.417 --> 06:54.833
He was lying dead after
the bridge, isn't it?

06:55.417 --> 06:57.000
If it is after the bridge, it
is not under my jurisdiction.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.750
C4 Station

07:04.167 --> 07:04.917
Sethupathi

07:07.417 --> 07:08.625
He is a psycho

07:09.208 --> 07:10.667
No one can win an
argument with him

07:11.458 --> 07:14.542
He is even worse now as he is
awaiting his ACP promotion.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.083
No. That's not possible.

07:18.167 --> 07:21.292
Try talking to him. You will
have your jaw thrashed.

07:37.042 --> 07:37.875
Come on!

07:47.333 --> 07:48.208
Oh my!

07:54.500 --> 07:55.125
Ouch!

07:55.458 --> 07:57.083
Ammu save daddy!

07:57.375 --> 08:02.958
- Ammu save daddy!
- Hey stop hitting my dad!

08:05.417 --> 08:07.667
Ammu, hit him. Hit him hard.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.292
Can I take some rest, please?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.792
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

08:33.707 --> 08:35.082
Ammu, hit him.

08:36.375 --> 08:37.792
Don't spare him.

08:40.207 --> 08:41.417
Yes. Tell me.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.167
Sir!

08:42.750 --> 08:45.083
The hospital... hosp...

08:47.458 --> 08:49.792
Ammu save me.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.042
- You go on.
- Ammu save me

08:53.917 --> 08:54.750
You go ahead man!

08:55.500 --> 08:56.750
I came to this hospital...

08:56.958 --> 08:57.667
Ammu hit him.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.250
- I will not leave you!
- I am not going to spare you!

09:03.292 --> 09:04.583
The hospital... postmortem...

09:04.708 --> 09:06.208
Wait. You go ahead.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.208
You go ahead man!

09:08.333 --> 09:12.208
I came to the hospital to get the postmortem
report. We can get it if you come.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.167
Nothing else. I am
hanging up sir!

09:14.458 --> 09:15.208
Ok. I'll come.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.750
Come on now.

09:21.000 --> 09:21.500
Hit him ammu.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.875
If anyone blurts out in pain,
then you will know me!

09:24.208 --> 09:27.208
Get hold of her. Save me dear!

09:27.458 --> 09:30.375
Don't hit the kids.
Just come and join us.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.125
- I need to pack the clothes
- Leave it and join us.

09:33.292 --> 09:37.333
- Wait wait.
- I'll join. Wait.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.833
Why can't you all be quiet?

09:44.333 --> 09:44.833
Hey! Come on.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.583
Leave this place.

09:48.875 --> 09:49.667
Leave.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.583
- Stop.
- Call the doctor.

09:53.250 --> 09:57.625
- Call the doctor. - Ask the doctor
to come out. We'll talk to him

09:57.958 --> 10:00.833
He showed his attitude,
now let me show mine.

10:03.708 --> 10:08.083
- Keep quiet - Why should we be
quiet? Call the doctor immediately.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.583
The inspector is inside.
Please be quiet for a while.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.458
Do you think we are
scared of cops?

10:11.583 --> 10:13.792
Call the doctor immediately.

10:13.917 --> 10:17.292
They'll kill you if you go inside.
Come out now.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.292
They have stabbed
him at 17 spots.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.208
They have burnt him after that.

10:21.375 --> 10:23.375
May be petrol or something

10:24.417 --> 10:26.375
Hey Doctor! Come outside.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.375
- I am calling out to you.
- All other details will be in the report.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.208
You can get it this evening
or tomorrow morning.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.208
I'll get the reports
tomorrow morning.

10:35.292 --> 10:38.208
If you can tell me the details,
I can start the investigation.

10:38.583 --> 10:41.542
I've been on duty all night.
I am very tired.

10:41.542 --> 10:44.750
The victim is a cop.
Please try to understand.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.875
Don't you understand
what I am saying.

10:47.208 --> 10:51.083
I've been awake the whole night. I
am very tired and need some sleep.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.167
What more do you
expect me to say?

10:53.208 --> 10:54.917
Hey! What's the noise there?

10:55.583 --> 10:57.333
Go check out, Idiot.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.958
You can sleep after an hour.
Give me the details now.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.583
There is a two inch
deep cut on his chest.

11:09.042 --> 11:14.042
Do you think we are scared of the cops?
Ask him to come out now!

11:15.917 --> 11:21.292
Run! Run! Let's run!

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
Thrash them!

11:47.083 --> 11:49.667
- Oh my God! Spare me please
- Get lost now!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.125
Sorry doctor. Tell me now.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.542
This is where they had
planned the murder.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.042
The evidences are empty alcohol
bottles, cigarette butts... Sir!

12:16.375 --> 12:16.875
It's a pit.

12:18.875 --> 12:19.792
Where are the evidences?

12:20.000 --> 12:20.708
In the car.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.500
- Where is the car?
- Its there.

12:23.417 --> 12:24.083
I'll go fetch them.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.500
- That's fine. We'll take a look
at them in the car. - Yes Sir!

12:31.083 --> 12:33.458
The post postmortem report says
that 3 people had stabbed him.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.042
It matches with our
evidence as well.

12:36.083 --> 12:36.750
- Is it?
- Yes sir.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.542
What about the one who
threw the bottle?

12:40.208 --> 12:42.250
- So its 4 men.
- What about the one who bought the bottle?

12:43.875 --> 12:45.083
Sorry! 5 men!

12:46.583 --> 12:49.042
- What else have you found out in your
investigation? - I am still trying.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.333
- Can you inform me when you
find something? - Sure sir!

12:59.667 --> 13:00.333
Move aside.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.917
- Who is the witness?
- Sir this... Hey come here.

13:06.042 --> 13:06.750
Tell him.

13:07.042 --> 13:09.167
- Did you see it first?
- Yes sir. It's me.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.458
I saw something burning on my
way to work in the morning.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.833
I went near and
there was a stench.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.333
I informed the cops immediately.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.625
That's all. I do not
know anything else.

13:16.917 --> 13:18.833
- Ok. Leave.
- Ok

13:22.833 --> 13:24.958
- Don't let anyone inside.
- Where was the vehicle?

13:25.542 --> 13:26.500
It was lying there.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.125
Was it lying or was it parked?

13:30.583 --> 13:31.833
It was parked on its side stand.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.958
There is no need for the
vehicle to be parked here.

13:38.708 --> 13:39.250
Muruganandham.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.167
(Yawning) Yes sir!

13:42.500 --> 13:43.542
- Do one thing.
- Tell me sir.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.125
- Go have a strong tea first.
- Ok

13:46.458 --> 13:47.625
After you have your tea...

13:48.500 --> 13:53.125
Find out who all went this way for work, people who
left the village or came to the village as well.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.417
Take care. Take your time.

13:58.208 --> 13:58.917
Make it fast.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.375
Sub Inspector Subburaj has been
murdered by unidentified men.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.917
The motive of the murder
is still unknown.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.625
The police is
investigating the murder.

14:14.708 --> 14:19.500
A fear has gripped the public as such
an incident has happened to a cop.

14:19.708 --> 14:23.125
It is said that he was
stabbed before being burnt.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.625
I've inquired in the village.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.583
There are no negative remarks about him.
Everyone vouched for his character.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.500
He was lying in his house
as it was off duty for him

14:31.833 --> 14:35.667
His wife was lamenting that he lost his
life as he substituted the duty of the SI.

14:36.250 --> 14:40.208
Hence I couldn't inquire more. I'll inquire
and give you the details in two days.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.792
- Tell me Murthy.
- I inquired with the mill watchman.

14:49.875 --> 14:52.250
He says that a husband
and wife went this way.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.417
He was not able to identify them. But he was
sure that they are not from the village.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.417
Find out who they are.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.917
Are you going to tell me or not?

15:27.833 --> 15:29.250
Don't keep repeating
what you've said.

15:29.708 --> 15:31.500
You tell me. Do you know or not?

15:37.708 --> 15:39.708
- Sir.
- Ask them to come.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.292
Keep the sentry book here.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.083
- Come in.
- Greetings.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.000
Tell me.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.458
My wife is missing.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.667
She always quarrels with me.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.292
The other day, she ran away
throwing away her mangalsutra.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.000
- I am sure she has an illegal affair.
- Hey!

16:05.458 --> 16:07.125
- What is your name?
- Praisika.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.833
- What grade are you studying in Praisika?
- Sixth grade.

16:10.375 --> 16:13.458
Your mom will be back soon. Please wait
outside and your dad will join you soon.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.250
- How long has she been missing?
- Its been four days.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.542
- What were you doing these four days?
- Searching for her.

16:23.292 --> 16:24.875
I am sure she has
an illegal affair.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.042
Don't blame a woman
unnecessarily.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.958
Give a written complaint.
I'll look into it.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.125
- Go now.
- Ok sir.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.875
Murthy. Arrange the roll call.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.125
Shall I write as wife missing,
illegal affair suspected?

16:41.958 --> 16:43.875
Just write as wife missing.

16:48.083 --> 16:48.958
Get ready for the roll call.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.708
Who is on court duty today?

17:02.292 --> 17:03.083
Manickam.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.708
- Ezhumalai.
- Yes sir.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.625
Did you eat? - Yes sir.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.416
Haven't I told you not to take the walkie
talkie without noting it in the sentry book?

17:10.791 --> 17:11.291
Sorry sir.

17:13.083 --> 17:13.583
Make the entry.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.541
Who went to Anuppanedi to
check drunken driving?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.375
Were you the only one?

17:23.375 --> 17:26.250
Are you not ashamed of hiding
at wine shops to get cases?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.292
They have snatched my chain.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.583
- Madam
- What happened?

17:33.875 --> 17:34.375
Who was it?

17:34.583 --> 17:36.000
Never disturb the
public unnecessarily.

17:36.042 --> 17:38.042
They snatched it.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.625
What happened?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.125
I don't know who it was.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.375
You are bleeding. Take
her to the hospital.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.583
- No sir. I want my chain.
- You will get your chain.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.083
- Take her to the doctor first.
- Please come.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.500
Its paining!

17:53.000 --> 17:53.708
Murthy

17:59.208 --> 18:01.583
- Inquire about the chain
snatching case first. - Yes Sir.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.458
I have to go to the SP office.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.292
Ask Moses to keep
Subburaj's file ready.

18:05.708 --> 18:06.208
Ok sir.

18:06.583 --> 18:07.708
- Murthy
- Sir

18:08.375 --> 18:09.583
He will say that the
Writer is on leave.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.417
The Writer is on leave.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.333
He knows that, it seems. He
asked you to fetch it.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.167
- Did he say that?
- Yes!

18:21.458 --> 18:24.083
I wonder where he has
placed the file.

18:26.458 --> 18:29.458
The file will not come to us, we
need to go in search of the file.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
- Did he say that too?
- I swear!

18:32.042 --> 18:34.292
Did he ask you to say this
when I start searching for it?

18:35.458 --> 18:38.375
- You will soon become the inspector!
- Thanks!

18:48.708 --> 18:49.375
Get ready with the vehicle.

18:50.417 --> 18:50.917
Murthy.

18:52.958 --> 18:53.833
Is the file ready?

18:54.042 --> 18:55.208
We are searching for it.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.333
- I'll go to the SP office. Take your time and search.
- Yes sir.

19:04.833 --> 19:07.583
Here it is. Before he can
shout at you, hand it to him.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.833
Go and hand it over.

19:36.917 --> 19:37.417
Hey

19:38.167 --> 19:38.667
Maaran

19:39.083 --> 19:40.208
Daddy...

19:42.417 --> 19:44.500
Hey Ammu. What are
you doing here?

19:46.833 --> 19:47.708
What happened darling?

19:47.833 --> 19:51.208
Mom and brother are hiding.
I have to find them.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.792
Is it? Shall we find them?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.292
Come.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.125
Ammu

20:07.375 --> 20:09.750
I'll go and find mom.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.250
- You go inside and look for brother.
- Ok

20:37.125 --> 20:38.000
What dear?

20:39.083 --> 20:40.292
You seem to be scared of cops

20:40.875 --> 20:42.000
I am not scared

20:44.167 --> 20:45.083
Are you hiding?

20:45.875 --> 20:47.042
You have found me now.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.708
I haven't found you yet.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.458
Enough of finding me. I am leaving.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.917
You are out of the game only when I
find you. I have not found you yet!

21:00.833 --> 21:02.417
The kids will be here anytime.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.542
We'll take care when they come.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.417
- Hey cop!
- Yes dear!

21:07.542 --> 21:09.417
You are making a mistake
and you will pay for it.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.917
Let's do the mistake first. I'll
take care of the paying part!

21:12.250 --> 21:13.750
Let's find where mom is.

21:18.292 --> 21:21.208
- Hey! Mom is out. Mom is out.
- Yes! Mom is out.

21:21.542 --> 21:22.750
Yes! Mom is out.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.292
Don't worry. Let's
play another game.

21:26.042 --> 21:29.292
- Shall we play another game?
- Yes. We are ready.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.792
No no. Let's not
play another game.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.917
- Hey. - Listen. Don't do
this in front of the kids.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.250
- Hey Maaran. Please ask mom to join the game.
- Mom. Let's play another game.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.792
- Mom please.
- Go now.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.708
Hey. Don't go guys.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.292
Please dear.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.667
Please curvy darling!

22:06.250 --> 22:10.667
You bring color to my Khakis

22:11.083 --> 22:15.208
You transform a cop to a thief

22:15.958 --> 22:20.583
With you by my side,
I have no sleep

22:21.083 --> 22:24.875
All my troubles dwindle away

22:25.292 --> 22:30.333
You make my world beautiful.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.542
Hawa Hawa Hawa

22:59.750 --> 23:04.625

I have no sleep

23:04.792 --> 23:09.417
All my troubles dwindle away

23:09.583 --> 23:13.625
You make my world beautiful

23:14.125 --> 23:16.542
Hawa Hawa Hawa

23:17.042 --> 23:18.708
Let’s be in love for eternity

23:28.708 --> 23:32.625
Let’s enjoy and face the odds.

24:07.333 --> 24:12.042
Gone with the time
Are our quarrels of that time

24:12.167 --> 24:16.958
Till the end of eternity
You will be my love

24:17.083 --> 24:21.542
There is no rivalry
Life is no race

Hawa Hawa Hawa

25:37.125 --> 25:37.625
Let’s live to love

25:39.792 --> 25:44.458
Let’s enjoy and face the odds.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.042
- Hello
- Hey darling.

26:14.750 --> 26:15.750
Yes. Tell me.

26:16.292 --> 26:16.917
Did you eat?

26:17.875 --> 26:19.708
Why didn't you pick your mobile?

26:20.292 --> 26:21.125
I don't know where I placed it.

26:21.792 --> 26:22.458
I didn’t hear it ring.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.542
Call your parents and
wish them after you eat.

26:26.042 --> 26:26.875
Why?

26:27.292 --> 26:28.500
Today is their
wedding anniversary.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.833
- Oh my! I forgot. Bye bye.
- Ok.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.417
- Hey! Hello hello
- Yes.

26:35.708 --> 26:38.708
- You too please wish them.
- I'll think about it.

26:39.458 --> 26:42.042
If not for my dad,
at least wish my mom.

26:42.375 --> 26:45.125
I am here for a case.
I'll finish this first.

26:46.292 --> 26:47.583
Thanks for coming.
Please take your seat.

26:48.208 --> 26:49.792
Two teas here.

26:53.833 --> 26:56.458
This is regarding SI Subburaj's case.

26:57.042 --> 27:01.708
I have a few doubts in that murder. I
wanted to meet you to discuss that.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.208
I am clear about three things of that case.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.583
Firstly, he does not have any
official or personal enemies.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.042
Secondly, this is a well planned murder.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.875
Thirdly, Subburaj was off duty that day.

27:14.292 --> 27:16.125
It was Kanagavel who was
supposed to be there.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.958
What if Subburaj was killed
instead of Kanagavel?

27:22.250 --> 27:25.292
If you can provide me details about
Kanagavel, I can proceed further.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.292
Hold on. Who gave you the permission to
enter my station and browse the records?

27:30.792 --> 27:32.125
What right do you have?

27:32.500 --> 27:35.000
I tried many times to reach you.
But I couldn't.

27:35.333 --> 27:38.542
How did you reach me now?

27:39.125 --> 27:40.458
You could have tried
the same way.

27:42.042 --> 27:45.125
- Sorry sir. Please leave that.
- Hold on!

27:45.292 --> 27:51.417
This isn't a soccer match to
kill someone instead of another.

27:51.917 --> 27:53.375
First investigate properly.

27:54.750 --> 27:59.375
What you said, looks like anyone with a cop's
attire would be been killed that night.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.375
Make a move!

28:02.583 --> 28:03.875
He is the sub inspector
of your station.

28:04.292 --> 28:06.250
- If you don’t co-operate...
- I am telling you the same.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.250
Why are you more worried
about it than us?

28:08.708 --> 28:13.458
You accept bribes and investigate
as a honest officer.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.167
- Wasting my time.
- Thank you.

28:19.583 --> 28:20.083
Hello

28:22.167 --> 28:24.667
Shall I enter your house when you are away?

28:25.333 --> 28:26.583
It feels the same for us too.

28:27.083 --> 28:30.208
You don't have an
answer to my question.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.667
Why should I answer
your questions?

28:33.208 --> 28:34.792
As though he is a big shot!

28:37.208 --> 28:39.208
What?

28:46.208 --> 28:47.833
Calm down. Please sit down.

28:54.750 --> 28:55.250
Sir tea.

29:02.375 --> 29:05.458
You haven't got the order
of becoming the ACP yet.

29:05.625 --> 29:10.625
With all these incidents, I can
easily stop your promotion.

29:10.792 --> 29:15.292
- I can't work considering...
- What are you trying to say? How can you hit an Inspector?

29:15.667 --> 29:19.375
- He didn't co-operate with me.
- What results have you got?

29:19.875 --> 29:21.042
Should I speak up or not?

29:23.333 --> 29:23.833
Tell me.

29:24.708 --> 29:27.917
To save Kanagavel, Subburaj has given
his life without his knowledge.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.042
Please take a look.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.125
I don't have any personal
vengeance against him.

29:41.667 --> 29:43.583
I am very sure that he is
also involved in this case.

29:44.208 --> 29:45.875
You inquire me for
hitting an inspector.

29:46.292 --> 29:48.125
It is because of him that the
wife of a cop is now a widow.

29:49.042 --> 29:50.250
What is your answer to them?

29:50.875 --> 29:52.250
That, your husband is dead?

29:52.708 --> 29:53.875
That, you can save on
the funeral expenses?

29:55.708 --> 29:57.833
We need to show them what happens
if they lay their hands on cops.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.583
I will not spare anyone
involved in this case.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.833
I cannot work for promotions.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.750
Hey! What are you
still doing here?

30:22.000 --> 30:22.958
Didn't I ask you to leave?

30:23.667 --> 30:24.750
Should I arrange a
farewell party?

30:25.417 --> 30:27.417
He has started digging deeper.

30:27.583 --> 30:31.292
Leave the place or I will
kill you and you child.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.042
I am talking to you and...

31:08.625 --> 31:09.375
Sir! Sir!

31:13.292 --> 31:13.792
Sir

31:19.083 --> 31:19.917
Where are they?

31:34.833 --> 31:35.333
Sir!

31:36.375 --> 31:36.875
Are you fine?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.875
I am alright sir!

31:50.417 --> 31:51.167
Oh my!

31:53.542 --> 31:55.250
Sir.. Sir...

32:02.417 --> 32:03.292
What are you doing here?

32:03.375 --> 32:04.750
Sir. Please go.

32:04.875 --> 32:08.083
I am acting as though am buying groceries.
Its a plan to catch them.

32:09.208 --> 32:09.708
Please go.

32:10.292 --> 32:12.583
I am on the run. Can you please
inform me, if you get hold of them?

32:12.708 --> 32:14.000
Sure sir!

32:31.292 --> 32:32.417
Run! Cops!

34:26.583 --> 34:28.042
Please spare us.

34:28.292 --> 34:30.750
Please forgive us.
We'll not do it again.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.917
How dare you lay your hands
on a police officer?

34:37.042 --> 34:39.500
It was a mistake.
Please spare us.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.917
Sorry sir.

34:41.958 --> 34:43.750
You mercilessly
burnt him alive...

34:43.792 --> 34:45.042
Sorry sir.

34:45.167 --> 34:45.958
...and now you ask forgiveness!

35:05.750 --> 35:07.708
Sir. I'll tell you everything.

35:08.167 --> 35:09.875
I will tell you everything.

35:10.167 --> 35:12.542
I will tell you everything sir.

35:12.708 --> 35:13.917
I don't care to spare you.

35:14.667 --> 35:18.042
I will tell you everything.
Please save me.

35:18.208 --> 35:19.542
I will be killed if I
tell you anything.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.208
Do you want to die now or
after a couple of days?

35:21.542 --> 35:22.833
You want security?

35:23.333 --> 35:24.042
Tell me the truth.

35:28.708 --> 35:29.458
Its Vaathiyar.

35:30.042 --> 35:34.083
Markets, travels, granite, real
estate, timber and other businesses.

35:34.417 --> 35:36.458
He controls the entire
central market.

35:37.083 --> 35:38.917
Nothing happens without
his knowledge.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.167
Not just that.

35:40.625 --> 35:43.458
No one dares to enter the Police
station without his permission.

35:43.917 --> 35:47.875
He is the force and he is the law.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.458
Greetings sir!

35:53.083 --> 35:53.875
Greetings!

35:55.250 --> 35:56.125
Sit down.

35:59.542 --> 36:01.542
Chelladurai wishes
to be the leader.

36:01.875 --> 36:02.750
Let's fulfill his wish.

36:03.667 --> 36:06.458
Listen Chelladurai. Becoming
the leader is not a big task.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.167
But if hear anything
wrong about you..

36:09.500 --> 36:11.083
That will be the end of it.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.208
Yes sir. Your blessings please.

36:15.250 --> 36:16.500
Greetings.

36:21.458 --> 36:25.000
- I'll go to court.
- Oh! You are going to the court is it?

36:27.292 --> 36:30.750
Siblings issue. He is going
to the court it seems.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.583
Are you going to the court?

36:32.833 --> 36:34.250
No sir.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.792
Just listen and follow what he says.

36:36.167 --> 36:38.042
Do you understand?
Have something and leave.

36:50.292 --> 36:51.417
Vaathiyar has a single daughter.

36:52.417 --> 36:56.583
As per her wishes, Vaathiyar did
not bother about the status...

36:56.875 --> 36:58.667
...and got her married to
sub inspector Kanagavel.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.583
She did not like
her life with him

37:02.750 --> 37:06.542
Kanagavel was content with his earnings
and did not seek out to Vaathiyar.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.083
They quarreled everyday.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.292
I'll send people when I reach

37:11.458 --> 37:13.667
You better sign the divorce papers...

37:19.583 --> 37:20.542
Please call this off dad.

37:20.833 --> 37:26.833
Kanagavel did not sign the divorce papers
out of fear of losing his daughter.

37:27.458 --> 37:31.167
Vaathiyar mediated the issue
and Kanagavel did not respect him.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.000
What?

37:32.958 --> 37:35.667
Vaathiyar bore all
this for his daughter.

37:35.833 --> 37:38.458
This is how am
struggling everyday.

37:38.958 --> 37:40.875
Dad!!

37:41.875 --> 37:46.333
The quarrel kept aggravating and
one day Kanagavel hit his wife.

37:46.792 --> 37:49.792
She said that she would
no longer live with him.

37:50.375 --> 37:51.958
She wanted to be separated
from him permanently.

37:52.625 --> 37:56.542
She said that, to be peaceful she did
not even care if her husband was dead.

37:57.625 --> 37:59.125
Now that his daughter has said this...

37:59.750 --> 38:04.417
Vaathiyar decided to finish off Kanagavel
without bothering about the consequences.

38:06.625 --> 38:08.083
The day they planned to murder Kanagavel...

38:08.792 --> 38:09.917
...he met with an accident.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.125
So instead of him, Subburaj
was assigned for night duty.

38:12.542 --> 38:14.917
The contract killers mistook Subburaj
for Kanagavel...

38:15.417 --> 38:16.625
...and killed him.

38:17.167 --> 38:17.958
This is what happened.

38:19.042 --> 38:21.958
Let's take legal action.
Wait for the order.

38:22.250 --> 38:23.500
- Ok?
- Yes Sir

38:54.250 --> 38:55.833
Mom had called.

38:57.667 --> 38:58.833
Pooja holidays are nearing.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.375
Mom wanted to see the kids.

39:02.250 --> 39:03.375
The phone is ringing. Get it.

39:04.042 --> 39:04.833
Get me the phone.

39:11.167 --> 39:12.167
Switch it on and give it.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.458
- Hello.
- Is it Mr.Sethu?

39:18.333 --> 39:19.208
Greetings sir.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.042
- I am Mathivaanan from Vaathiyar's house.
- Tell me what the matter is.

39:22.750 --> 39:25.750
Nothing. Uncle wanted to talk to you.

39:26.208 --> 39:30.292
If you can give an appointment, Vaathiyar
would like to discuss with you in person.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.708
It is something big that he
is coming down to meet you.

39:35.583 --> 39:36.083
Hello

39:41.750 --> 39:42.250
He hung up.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.708
Mom had called.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.333
Tell me what the matter is. You've
been beating around the bush.

39:50.458 --> 39:52.750
She wanted to see all of
us and told us to visit.

39:53.083 --> 39:54.542
If you want you can go.
Why are you asking me?

39:55.375 --> 39:56.833
Did I talk so much to go alone?

39:57.083 --> 39:58.417
What do you want me to do?

39:58.667 --> 40:01.125
Dad is old. Why can't you
compromise with him?

40:01.750 --> 40:02.792
I am saying the same.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.458
Your father has grown old.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.250
Why can't he compromise?

40:17.958 --> 40:18.458
Hey!

40:20.375 --> 40:21.167
Serve chutney.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.208
Fatso!

40:30.625 --> 40:31.333
What?

40:32.167 --> 40:33.417
Will he fall in our line?

40:34.458 --> 40:36.500
Will he even have a choice?

40:36.875 --> 40:39.625
I'll meet him directly and seal the deal.
I'll meet you after that.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.167
Hey darling. How is it?

40:56.875 --> 40:57.375
Sir

40:57.833 --> 41:01.125
Mathivaanan from Vaathiyar's
house has come to meet you.

41:03.542 --> 41:04.875
Check if the fax machine
is switched on.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.458
Ok Sir. Mathivaanan...

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I told you to check
the fax machine.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.042
Hey darling.

41:16.417 --> 41:17.458
Sorry fatso!

41:17.583 --> 41:18.750
Here he is.

41:19.375 --> 41:20.167
Can we meet him?

41:20.792 --> 41:24.042
He is not in a good mood.
He is furious.

41:24.125 --> 41:25.708
It's getting late. I can't
explain things to uncle.

41:25.750 --> 41:26.542
Moses.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.833
- Sir.
- What were you discussing, Moses?

41:34.292 --> 41:37.542
Nothing sir. They
are known to me.

41:37.833 --> 41:40.625
If they are known to you, why are
you chit chatting with them here?

41:41.958 --> 41:43.750
Keep your all your
relationships at your house.

41:45.333 --> 41:46.167
This is my station.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.292
Go now.

41:54.042 --> 41:54.542
Hey!

41:55.958 --> 41:57.833
- Fill all the details here.
- Hey Moses.

41:59.875 --> 42:00.458
Listen

42:04.292 --> 42:06.042
Hey! Won't you be quiet?

42:07.292 --> 42:09.000
I am going to thrash you!

42:26.458 --> 42:28.000
- When did you lose it?
- Last week.

42:28.250 --> 42:29.333
- Murthy
- Sir

42:29.750 --> 42:31.542
- Is the fax ready?
- Yes sir. We can leave.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.542
Hello sir. We've been waiting....

42:32.583 --> 42:35.792
Fill the address clearly.
We'll look into it.

42:37.958 --> 42:40.625
We know it. Won't we
inform you if we get it.

42:41.083 --> 42:42.583
Inspector is leaving for a work.

42:43.708 --> 42:46.125
Sir. I've been
wanting to meet you.

42:46.542 --> 42:48.375
There is no information
about my chain.

42:48.625 --> 42:51.542
- Can you please help me?
- How long will you take?

42:52.125 --> 42:52.875
I am looking into it sir.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.042
Do I have to
constantly follow up?

42:56.542 --> 42:57.208
Idiot.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.583
You will get your
chain in two days.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.292
Please leave now.

43:03.083 --> 43:03.792
Trust us.

43:05.292 --> 43:06.042
Madam

43:06.333 --> 43:08.250
- Where did you say the incident happened?
- Near Ganesh theater

43:09.625 --> 43:10.292
Ok. Please leave.

43:13.208 --> 43:14.667
I am looking into it sir.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.042
There is nothing
impossible for me here.

43:24.458 --> 43:25.625
This is just a small issue.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.125
The murder should've been neat.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.458
A small mistake and...

43:29.875 --> 43:31.500
...today that guy is alive.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.292
We'll see for how long that is.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.375
Otherwise, I don't even know
the guy who was killed.

43:36.833 --> 43:39.542
What needs to be done for
his family will be done. Better than ever.

43:39.833 --> 43:41.750
What will the government do?

43:43.833 --> 43:44.542
Sir. It's ready.

43:45.667 --> 43:48.375
Is it? Just a moment.

44:31.875 --> 44:34.417
Why haven't you had
the coffee yet?

44:34.667 --> 44:35.583
No, thanks sir.

44:39.458 --> 44:40.417
What was I saying?

44:42.167 --> 44:44.458
I don't even know the
guy who was killed.

44:44.792 --> 44:46.292
To the family of that guy...

44:46.500 --> 44:47.875
...I will do what is required.
That's my responsibility.

44:48.417 --> 44:51.083
- Dad!
- Yes dear.

44:51.208 --> 44:53.750
- Send my kid. She will start crying out of hunger.
- Go and eat dear.

44:54.458 --> 44:58.458
Dear, he is the inspector
I told you about.

44:58.542 --> 44:59.708
Greetings.

45:01.625 --> 45:05.667
My glance is enough for my
guys to fulfill my orders.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.167
But, shouldn't we respect you for having
respected our call and making it here.

45:10.417 --> 45:11.917
Please walk out from this case.

45:12.417 --> 45:14.042
I'll offer whatever
is required for that.

45:14.792 --> 45:17.625
Either ways is fine for me.
What do you say?

45:19.292 --> 45:20.667
Now you have to decide.

45:27.917 --> 45:28.417
Sir!

45:29.167 --> 45:31.500
Speak out one more word and you'll
hear all the foul language I know!

45:33.083 --> 45:35.833
Keep calm and board the vehicle.
Or else, I'll thrash and take you!

45:35.875 --> 45:37.667
What are you saying?

45:39.292 --> 45:41.500
How dare you?

45:48.708 --> 45:49.208
Murthy

45:55.708 --> 45:58.125
Who is this Police officer?

45:58.250 --> 46:00.458
He has dared to lay hands
on Vaathiyar himself.

46:00.875 --> 46:05.583
No one can even question him.

46:06.042 --> 46:12.042
He has been our strength.
Now he is being arrested.

46:14.667 --> 46:16.542
This cop shows a lot of attitude.

46:33.208 --> 46:33.708
Sir!

46:34.083 --> 46:34.583
Sir!

46:34.958 --> 46:37.167
Wait! Where are you going?

46:37.208 --> 46:38.542
- How long should we wait?
- He has just come.

46:38.708 --> 46:42.083
- Please inform him. How long should we wait?
- Please keep quiet.

46:43.625 --> 46:46.292
Please be seated.

46:55.958 --> 46:58.208
Uncle!

46:59.417 --> 47:00.833
Why are you here?

47:01.667 --> 47:02.417
Speak out uncle.

47:02.917 --> 47:04.792
Hey! Hey you!

47:05.333 --> 47:07.042
Sir is calling you. Come inside.

47:07.208 --> 47:09.292
I'll talk to him.

47:17.708 --> 47:19.083
- Sir
- Yes

47:19.250 --> 47:19.833
They are here.

47:21.625 --> 47:22.125
Tell me.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.333
I understand that you've been
waiting from morning. Tell me.

47:30.542 --> 47:31.750
Why are you guys blinking?

47:32.500 --> 47:33.708
Tell me what the matter is.

47:36.833 --> 47:40.417
Murthy. They are staring at me and
its funny! Ask them to leave!

47:43.167 --> 47:44.542
Hey! Leave now.

47:45.125 --> 47:47.667
- Don't make me laugh.
- Go now.

47:52.708 --> 47:53.208
Uncle

47:57.333 --> 47:57.833
Uncle

47:58.750 --> 48:00.292
I can't stand this sight!

48:04.708 --> 48:05.875
I'll be back with
the lawyer soon.

48:06.250 --> 48:08.375
Come. We'll get the lawyer.

48:08.625 --> 48:10.417
- Shall we go?
- Come. We'll deal with this.

48:16.250 --> 48:17.667
Dad. I am ready.

48:17.958 --> 48:18.667
Ready for what?

48:19.208 --> 48:20.917
Please dad. Take
me along with you.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.792
Maaran. Dad is going
on an official trip.

48:24.875 --> 48:27.625
I will be away and so you have
to be the man incharge here.

48:27.750 --> 48:31.792
Mom asked me to go along with you.
The school is off tomorrow.

48:34.292 --> 48:35.917
Did your mom say that?

48:38.708 --> 48:40.042
Wait. I'll talk to her.

48:40.708 --> 48:43.292
Mom, Dad has agreed.
Pack my clothes as well.

48:47.542 --> 48:49.000
He has fooled me with
an empty suitcase.

48:49.875 --> 48:51.000
You little rogue!

48:53.792 --> 48:56.542
Pack both our clothes
in a single suitcase.

48:57.250 --> 48:58.417
I can't be carrying
extra baggage.

49:01.458 --> 49:03.125
- Hey Maaran.
- Dad.

49:03.125 --> 49:05.250
- It's getting late.
- I am ready.

49:05.333 --> 49:05.833
Hi darling!

49:08.958 --> 49:11.625
Didn't I ask you to pack
everything in a single suitcase.

49:12.375 --> 49:18.292
Maaran, the charger, towel and soap
is in this bag. Remind dad about it.

49:20.167 --> 49:21.000
Shall I leave?

49:21.292 --> 49:24.333
Be careful. Don't
go away from dad.

49:24.917 --> 49:25.833
Be safe.

49:26.042 --> 49:28.875
- Bye dear.
- Take care.

49:30.458 --> 49:32.917
- Amma, dad is leaving.
- Bye dad. Be safe.

49:34.042 --> 49:36.375
Ok darling. Take care of mom.

49:37.083 --> 49:38.667
- Bye
- Bye dad.

49:39.250 --> 49:40.000
Ok. I am leaving.

49:57.417 --> 49:58.542
- Uncle
- Sir

49:59.375 --> 50:01.667
- Sir. He is not anywhere here.
- Uncle.

50:04.375 --> 50:05.875
Where have you taken uncle?

50:07.917 --> 50:10.542
Hey! Who are you? Why are
you creating trouble here?

50:10.625 --> 50:11.375
Get out of the station now.

50:11.583 --> 50:14.292
- Where is my uncle?
- Uncle? I don't know any uncle.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.833
- Where have you taken him after the remand?
- We never remanded him!

50:16.958 --> 50:18.458
- We didn't remand anyone.
- They are playing a game.

50:18.583 --> 50:19.667
Don't bluff.

50:19.750 --> 50:23.625
- Oh. So you guys want to play. I'll take care.
- Fine then. You take care.

50:23.750 --> 50:27.125
- I'll see what I can do.
- Oh that’s great!

50:27.625 --> 50:29.958
I'll take care of
you when am back.

50:32.458 --> 50:35.542
Sir. The vehicle has left.
Francis is with them.

50:36.208 --> 50:37.250
- Is it?
- Yes.

50:38.083 --> 50:41.625
Do not stop the vehicle.
Don't go inside the village.

50:42.833 --> 50:46.125
Get him whatever
he wants to eat.

50:46.792 --> 50:47.792
Where is the vehicle now?

50:58.208 --> 50:59.792
That's how I am.
What is bothering you?

51:00.208 --> 51:02.125
Oh is it? Give the
phone to daddy.

51:02.667 --> 51:03.417
- Give.
- Here dad.

51:04.333 --> 51:11.708
- Yes dear.
- It seems, Maaran will become an actor and not a cop like you.

51:12.042 --> 51:13.083
- Is it?
- Yes

51:13.958 --> 51:15.083
What will he do after
becoming an actor?

51:15.958 --> 51:17.833
He will act as if he is
fighting the baddies.

51:18.125 --> 51:21.708
- But what about dad?
- You thrash the baddies for real.

51:22.042 --> 51:25.375
That's my darling.
What is mom doing?

51:27.417 --> 51:30.625
- She is not here.
- Oh is it?

51:32.125 --> 51:34.542
What's there on your hand?

51:35.833 --> 51:38.875
- Not there. The other side.
- No. Don't turn it.

51:40.458 --> 51:42.667
Fatso! Be careful.
You might fall.

51:43.583 --> 51:44.917
Only I will be there to
take care even then.

51:47.167 --> 51:47.875
What?

51:51.042 --> 51:53.292
Hey! Will you talk to me or not?

51:55.667 --> 51:56.542
What is it?

51:57.417 --> 51:59.583
Maaran. Ask mom to talk to me.

51:59.833 --> 52:02.708
Mom please talk to daddy.
Please mom. Poor daddy!

52:02.792 --> 52:04.917
- Yea. Poor daddy!
- Take it mom.

52:07.208 --> 52:10.375
Hey Maaran. Did you eat?

52:10.667 --> 52:13.042
Be careful and be safe.

52:15.417 --> 52:16.250
You too.

52:18.708 --> 52:19.208
I'll hang up

52:19.917 --> 52:21.417
Ok. Bye.

52:27.125 --> 52:28.250
Here is your dinner.

52:29.917 --> 52:30.917
Forget it.

53:06.292 --> 53:06.792
Hey!

53:08.083 --> 53:09.542
Ammu is sleeping.
She might wake up.

53:09.917 --> 53:12.708
What is your problem? You want to visit
your mom, isn't it. I'll take you.

53:13.083 --> 53:15.542
- That wont be required.
- Its a little too much.

53:16.792 --> 53:17.833
I am not doing anything

53:18.292 --> 53:19.833
Hey Fatso! You
better listen to me.

53:20.750 --> 53:22.833
Look at me. Wait..

53:23.583 --> 53:26.250
You were dull when you called earlier
and you didn't have a bindhi.

53:27.000 --> 53:27.875
How did it come now?

53:29.458 --> 53:30.750
It was there already.

53:31.125 --> 53:34.083
I am a cop. I know that
the bindhi was not there.

53:34.792 --> 53:37.417
- No. It was there.
- It wasn't.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.542
Now, what if the bindhi is there or not?

53:40.208 --> 53:45.292
You have freshened up after I called
you and you give me dull emotions.

53:45.500 --> 53:48.750
If you like me, say that you like me.
If you don't like me, say that you like me.

54:03.875 --> 54:05.958
Allure me not with
your sweet talks

54:06.292 --> 54:08.792
Your eyes do the magic

54:09.000 --> 54:11.583
A little glance is all it needs

54:11.750 --> 54:14.208
For the sky to drizzle

54:14.458 --> 54:19.625
Whatever I do
I crave for your glance

54:19.875 --> 54:25.167
The farther we are
The stronger our love is

54:25.375 --> 54:31.375
Far, yet very close!

54:33.750 --> 54:38.750
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

54:38.958 --> 54:44.250
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

54:44.292 --> 54:49.667
Whatever I do
I crave for your glance

54:49.792 --> 54:55.208
The farther we are
The stronger our love is

54:55.625 --> 55:01.125
Far, yet very close!

55:39.417 --> 55:44.250
Desire spins a web
And our hearts slip into it

55:44.583 --> 55:50.125
We try to recover
Only to slip in again

55:50.292 --> 55:55.375
Is solitude killing you?
Thoughts excruciating you

55:55.708 --> 56:01.333
Is your pillow scented
with my fragrance?

56:01.500 --> 56:06.417
You abduct me with
your intense looks

56:06.583 --> 56:12.042
You place me amidst
the sun and the snow

56:12.125 --> 56:17.417
All I desire is your presence

56:17.500 --> 56:23.208
And surprise with a silent kiss

56:26.792 --> 56:28.625
Hey! What?

56:29.250 --> 56:31.667
Either you get the child or
take the bag. Why are you still?

56:37.125 --> 56:38.167
Are you starting it again?

56:38.750 --> 56:40.458
Didn't we resolve
it over the call?

56:42.958 --> 56:45.125
Look into my eyes when
am talking to you.

56:46.583 --> 56:47.375
Look at me.

56:49.042 --> 56:54.458
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

56:54.583 --> 56:59.458
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

56:59.917 --> 57:08.417
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

57:08.917 --> 57:17.833
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

57:26.917 --> 57:28.750
- Did you take him to the court?
- Yes sir.

57:29.375 --> 57:31.333
- Who has accompanied from our side?
- Manickam.

57:33.458 --> 57:35.250
He will be bailed out for sure.

57:35.625 --> 57:38.750
That's for sure. But we had
him in custody for two days.

57:39.875 --> 57:41.292
He'll remember it for life.

57:45.292 --> 57:46.625
Why are you hitting me? Sir!

57:49.292 --> 57:54.292
Sir! Please don't hit us.
Its painful!

57:54.375 --> 57:56.417
Its painful!

57:56.500 --> 57:59.042
- Murthy, What is it?
- Sir

57:59.958 --> 58:01.542
These are the culprits of
the chain snatching case.

58:02.250 --> 58:03.208
Break their bones.

58:04.417 --> 58:06.625
Ask them where the chain
is and inform that lady.

58:08.750 --> 58:11.875
The chain is not with these guys.
It's with them.

58:20.792 --> 58:23.292
Faster. Faster!

58:23.458 --> 58:24.958
Give it. How much
will you drink?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.458
Let's go! Let's go!

58:34.542 --> 58:35.833
Sit down! Fast.

58:35.958 --> 58:37.750
Catch hold of them! Catch them!

58:38.042 --> 58:42.167
They snatched my chain.
Please get hold of them!

58:44.500 --> 58:47.333
I've lost my chain.

58:47.833 --> 58:52.125
- Oh my!
- Last week too there was a chain snatching incident.

58:52.250 --> 58:55.667
This has become a routine.

58:55.750 --> 58:59.042
These guys have to be caught.
Wonder what the cops are up to.

58:59.958 --> 59:01.542
- Which grade?
- 12th grade

59:01.833 --> 59:04.958
Did you investigate properly? These
teens might be blabbering out of fear.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.375
It's confirmed.

59:06.708 --> 59:08.458
They have earlier been
booked under a petty case.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.333
They have sold the chain
and bought a new mobile.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.833
Tell me guys. Where have
you kept the chain?

59:21.292 --> 59:22.833
We don't know anything.

59:23.292 --> 59:25.083
We'll not do anything.

59:25.292 --> 59:26.625
I'll even book the case on them.

59:26.750 --> 59:29.000
I said, we don't know anything.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.833
- Shall I call your parents?
- As I said, we don't know anything.

59:31.750 --> 59:34.750
- How dare you?
- Don't you dare lay your hands on us.

59:35.333 --> 59:35.833
Murthy

59:36.958 --> 59:40.000
- What?
- Why is he raising his hands on students?

59:40.708 --> 59:42.792
They are right, Murthy.

59:43.042 --> 59:45.625
Why do you raise your
hands on students?

59:45.958 --> 59:48.625
Murthy! You don't seem
to know anything!

59:50.792 --> 59:53.458
We'll finish with
them the other way.

59:54.375 --> 59:56.500
- The other way man.
- Oh yes! Fine sir!

59:56.625 --> 59:58.500
- Ok
- Fine sir.

59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.542
We'll take care of you guys.

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:05.083
Did you guys eat?

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.125
We don't want anything.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.333
Tell me if you are hungry. I'll
ask them to get something.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:09.375
No. Thanks!

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:10.458
What about you?

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.917
Why are you guys so grim?

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:16.625
Think and tell me.

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:27.917
How long do you think
you can be silent?

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:29.750
Sir

01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:36.292
So, both of you will not open up isn't it?

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:42.625
Fine.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:44.375
I'll count to 5.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:48.208
One of you should tell the
truth before I finish.

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.417
Otherwise...

01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:53.542
Murthy

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.625
One

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:01.375
Two

01:01:05.042 --> 01:01:06.375
Three

01:01:08.208 --> 01:01:09.125
What guys?

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:14.958
Four

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:23.833
Shall I say it?

01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:28.667
Five...

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:31.917
Hey! Get hold of him!

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:09.333
Sir!

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.417
He is alive. Come here.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.208
Lift him.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:23.458
Lift him up.

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:25.375
Go now.

01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:27.958
Hurry. Take him.

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:29.417
Go on.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:37.417
The news is out. The public
might attack us. Let's leave.

01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:40.042
- Why should I leave?
- Sir please.

01:02:40.167 --> 01:02:42.833
Please sir. I plead you.
Please leave.

01:02:43.208 --> 01:02:44.583
Please. Let's leave.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.250
Go ahead sir. This way.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.875
Stay here. Please
don't come out.

01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:07.583
Please don't come out.
I'll take care.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:11.208
- Where have you hid him?
- Let him out.

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:14.375
- Call the inspector.
- Don't let anyone inside.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.500
Will you do anything
if you are cops?

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:17.542
Such arrogance!

01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:19.625
Hey! Check the back door.

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:22.417
- Get out.
- We'll not spare you guys.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.042
We are going to
torch this station.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:27.458
Break open the doors
and get inside.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.083
- Get out.
- Send him out.

01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:36.458
- Where is the inspector? Call him out.
- What are you all doin here. Leave.

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.750
I said leave.

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:42.792
I said leave. Look at them charging in.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:46.500
Move. I said leave.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.708
Sir please, I want to see my son.
Please let me in.

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.625
Please I want to meet my son.

01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:58.333
I am worried about son and they
are not allwoing me inside.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:00.667
These sinners have shot him!

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.125
I curse these guys.

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:05.750
This is injustice!

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.417
Sinners! How could
they do this to him?

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:13.708
This incident has created tension
among the people of Madurai.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:16.125
The police, responsible for
protecting the people...

01:04:16.333 --> 01:04:20.083
had arrested the 17 year old Bala
for an inquiry and have shot him.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:21.417
Sinners!

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.958
- I need more intenstiy.
- Sinners!!

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.042
How can they be so ruthless?

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:28.750
Inspector Sethupathi, who is the
man behind this ruthless act...

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:32.500
escaped from the Police
station, as per the reports.

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:35.583
Here is an exclusive speech by
the MPK party on this incident.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:37.958
Without any consideration
for a young boy...

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:43.083
...this inspector has ruthlessly
inquired him using weapons.

01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:46.167
Our MPK party condemns this act.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.833
Strongly condemns this.

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:51.125
This cop should not be allowed
to continue his service.

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:53.125
Not that, instead he
should be dismissed.

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:54.958
Yes, he should be dismissed.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:56.125
Not it's suspension.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.667
I heard a blast,

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.292
then I saw people
running in and out.

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:01.875
Later, an ambulance arrived...

01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:03.917
but I've no idea where
the ambulance left.

01:05:04.042 --> 01:05:06.708
But one thing, the police
never stepped out.

01:05:06.917 --> 01:05:08.083
He escaped away.

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:11.250
The people are expecting a suspension
for police Inspector Sethupathi.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:16.792
They beileve that this decision will prevent
such incidents from happening in the future.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.417
The gun was locked.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:58.208
Which means it cannot
be triggered or fired.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.250
Let's assume that it was
unlocked while handling it.

01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:04.875
In that case when triggered the bullet won't
go through the chamber unless it's clocked.

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:05.875
I didn't clock it.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:07.583
Then how did it shoot?

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:34.125
Haven't you heard? He shot
a young innocent boy.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.250
- Sir.
- There is no news if the guy is dead or alive.

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.250
Yes sir. He was
the one who shot.

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:41.125
He collapsed the
moment he got shot.

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:44.125
- He was then carried away from there.
- He is the one.

01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:54.833
You know about his
way of inquiry.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.333
He points the gun at the person
first and then starts his inquiry.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.500
Did you see him shoot?

01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:01.292
- No sir. - Then stop talking
unnecessarily. Now get lost.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.125
Sir, I don't know
anything about it.

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.542
How is it possible that none
of them in the station saw it?

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.333
I was not in the
station that day.

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.250
I was on beat duty.

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.458
I heard the news later.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:13.292
Sir, we are innocent.

01:07:13.667 --> 01:07:16.125
We were forced to
accept the crime.

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:17.917
We were threatned with guns.

01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:20.250
- Did he threaten to shoot you?
- Yes sir.

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:23.708
I was not present at the spot. I was
outside cleaning the vehicle.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:26.125
I rushed in when I
heard the gun fire.

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:30.458
The gun was with him
but he didn't... fire

01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.000
The boy got up and ran.
We chased him.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:34.583
Then there was a gun fire.

01:07:35.167 --> 01:07:36.250
and when we arrived there...

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:37.792
He was the one who triggered it.
Right?

01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:39.583
Do you think the gun
will trigger itself?

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:51.333
Sir...

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:55.333
Please don't worry.

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:57.792
It's our men they are inquiring.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.292
We'll take care. It's all upto us.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.083
- Murthy
- Sir?

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:10.500
The gun wasn't clocked...

01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:14.000
Then how would the bullet
go through the chamber?

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:16.167
Correct sir!

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:19.875
The other day, it was me who kept it.
At that time it was locked.

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:22.375
Even now I was the one who
got it from the locker.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.167
The how could it... ?

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.042
I didn't unlock it...

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:32.582
Sir, just a moment.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.042
- Sir.
- Stop it. Stop treating him like an accused.

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:41.542
- Sir, give me your phone.
- Sir, what happened?

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:43.917
Sir, the boy died
at the hospital.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.750
AC has summoned you.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.167
Give me you phone.

01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:55.832
Sir, you wait.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.957
Sir. Sir, hold on for a minute.

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:25.832
Sir, give me the phone first.

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:27.207
What's the hurry?

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:28.457
I said give the phone.

01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:35.582
Sir, it seems the
news is a fake one.

01:09:35.707 --> 01:09:37.250
It's a rumour sparked
by the media.

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:39.167
Nothing has happened to the boy.
He is fine.

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.250
These people, without knowing what has
happened... Sir, please get down.

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:46.917
Wait, let me hire
an autorikshaw..

01:09:47.707 --> 01:09:48.750
- I'll take care.
- I'll hire a rickshaw...

01:09:48.792 --> 01:09:50.000
I said, I'll take care.

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:53.292
Sir...

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.000
Oh! Looks like I forgot to lock.

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.375
Mom is here.

01:10:53.167 --> 01:10:54.208
Now open your mouth.

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:56.417
Come in son-in-law.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:58.625
Wash your hands.
I'll serve food.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.833
The food is ser...

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.500
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.792
- Don't worry we'll take care of it.
- Sir! - Sir!

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:42.792
What is this?

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:45.417
Who broke the latch?

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.208
I don't know

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:51.875
The keys are with you right?

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:56.750
Unless the door is locked the
latch cannot be broken. Right?

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:00.625
I don't know.

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:02.625
So you don't know?

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:07.375
- Move out. Move!
- Make it fast.

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:12.958
All those who were present the other
day, stay back. Others leave.

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:15.625
Were you there? Then get out!

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:33.500
- Murthy...
- Sir?

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.375
Go get the gun.

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.333
Now come on.

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:58.458
Catch him.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:15.958
Francis...

01:13:18.167 --> 01:13:18.667
Sir?

01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:25.375
Why did you come
inside, the other day?

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:26.375
When sir?

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:29.125
The day, when two
boys were arrested...

01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:30.792
and I shot one of them.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.208
On that day, you came in rushing.
Why did you come in?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.958
I came hearing the gun fire.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.292
Francis...

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.458
Think about lie to which
I could fall for.

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:43.750
I forgot sir...

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.208
The vehicle had a flat tyre. I
actually came in to inform that.

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:51.958
Sir, indeed the vehicle
got a flat tyre.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:55.417
I am aware why and
for whom you did...

01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:01.292
Sir...

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.417
I did it for Vaathiyar.

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:08.667
I was shopping to buy a television.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:11.208
My wife wanted an even bigger TV
than the one we intented to buy.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:14.917
As I couldn't afford that, we
returned home empty handed.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:18.958
One day, when I returned home there
was the televsion my wife wanted.

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:23.250
- What is this?
- This is childlock button madam.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.000
Look here!

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.042
How did this
television come here?

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:27.625
- Be patient.
- If you don't want any channel you can lock them.

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:29.750
Some guys of
Vaathiyar gave this.

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:32.458
This is the zoom in
and zoom out option.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:35.333
And here, you can search
and set the channels it.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
- I'll set everything and leave. Here is my card.
- TEXT: Vaathiyar's gift. Wait for further information.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:45.792
As stated in the letter, Vaathiyar's guy met
me with a parcel. He had his helmet on.

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:49.917
The parcel had Rs.1 lakh...

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.833
...and the dummy magazine.

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:56.958
The letter informed me to
replace the dummy in your gun.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:01.583
I accepted to do it
for want of money!

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:03.583
Pandi...

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:04.333
Sir?

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.083
Go check who is
shouting there outside.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:06.708
Ok sir.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:31.625
- There is no one out there.
- Is it?

01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:32.375
Fine. Leave it.

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:40.417
C4 station reporting sir. Over.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.417
Sir

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.042
- Ok sir
- Thanks sir

01:15:45.292 --> 01:15:45.792
Ok sir.

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.083
On the way sir. Over.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.792
I went in and checked
out the gun.

01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.083
I didn't know how
to set the dummy.

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:10.500
So I tried out whatever I could.

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:12.833
By then I heard
someone coming in

01:16:13.583 --> 01:16:16.500
So I left it, as it is.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
This is what happened.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:20.417
Sorry sir. Forgive me.

01:16:21.375 --> 01:16:22.542
Did you clock it?

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.375
Did you pull the top
and clock the gun?

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.625
I did it that way. Nothing else.
Sorry sir.

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.292
I don't know anything sir.

01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.000
I was asked to puncture the vehicle,
so that you would use your bike.

01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:36.667
I promise I don't
know anything else.

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.042
So you punctured the bike
because you were asked to?

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:39.833
Yes sir.

01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:43.125
- And you don't know anything else?
- I don't know anything else.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.708
An insult to the trust
I had upon you...

01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:49.750
Absolutely no knowledge
on operating a gun...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.292
and you call yourself a cop.

01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:54.625
People out there are struggling
to become a cop.

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:58.167
and you show up at the station to
while away time, eat and take bribes.

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:02.333
- Murthy
- Sir?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.667
Ask them to leave or
I'll butcher them.

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:08.583
Get up. Get up. Get lost.

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:15.708
Sir...

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:22.458
Sir, now that it is clear that Vaathiyar
is behind all this. What next?

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.417
Why should Vaathiyar do this?

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:29.042
Sir, isn't it quite obvious?

01:17:29.167 --> 01:17:32.375
You insulted him and put him behind bars.
He wants to revenge.

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:34.458
No chance.

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:35.292
Now...

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.417
In the current situation...

01:17:38.917 --> 01:17:41.167
Let alone Vaathiyar, even if
anyone lay their hands on me...

01:17:41.417 --> 01:17:43.917
The blame will still be on him.
He knows that very well.

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:49.208
How would Vaathiyar know that Muruganandam's
wife wanted a biger television?

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:51.083
That's right sir.

01:17:54.667 --> 01:17:56.000
Rewind it.

01:17:57.167 --> 01:17:57.667
Little more.

01:17:59.083 --> 01:17:59.833
Keep going.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.917
Hold it right there.

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:06.500
- That's Muruganandam right?
- Yes sir.

01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:09.750
- Ask him to continue...
- Forward it a little bit.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:17.458
- Hold it.
- Hod it.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.875
Zoom in.

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.917
- Doesn't it look like Kanagavel?
- Yes sir.

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:47.167
I cannot go against
my father-in-law.

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:51.208
Sethupathi sir insulted him
and put him behind bars.

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:54.583
His men would've definitely
tried to finish off Sethupathi.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:57.000
So I took advantage of
the situation and...

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.625
I tried to replace dummy
bullets in the gun.

01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:06.083
If something happens to Sethupathi because
of this, the department won't spare them.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.167
The case against him will
be even more stronger.

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:12.500
He'll either be encountered or put
behind bars under a non-bailable case.

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:14.875
So you didn't care
about Sethupathi.

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:17.708
All you wanted was to finish off your
father-in-law in a police encounter.

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:20.167
And you call yourself a cop.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:24.000
- Sir, It was a mistake.
- Thank you sir.

01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:26.750
- Sir, It was a mistake. Sir...

01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:31.958
Yes sir. I've spoken to Kanagavel.

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:34.125
Tomorrow morning 11 a.m
Murthy will go get him.

01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:35.625
- Leave it.
- No, let me do it.

01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:38.458
-  I want to carry it. Leave it.
-  Leave it.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.792
I'll carry it. Leave.

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:44.292
- I'll carry it. Now leave!
- Leave.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.458
- Sorry dad.
- Sorry dad.

01:19:54.292 --> 01:19:55.417
Awesome!!

01:20:27.708 --> 01:20:28.500
Go check.

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:43.042
- Didn't you hear the bell sound?
- Yes.

01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:45.333
- But no one's at the door.
- Forget it. Now come on.

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:51.458
Wait I'll go check.
You continue dear.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.083
Be careful.

01:21:58.917 --> 01:21:59.875
Hey Kanagavel!

01:22:00.417 --> 01:22:01.750
Sir! Save me!

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:02.208
If you get back your work based on his
statement, then what are we here for?

01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:05.500
What is he capable of?

01:23:06.583 --> 01:23:07.083
Now look...

01:23:07.917 --> 01:23:09.625
He is burnt to ashes with
no one to question!

01:23:10.125 --> 01:23:12.542
How are you going to
get back your work?

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:16.125
- Catch hold of him.
- Hold him.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:22.250
Without the uniform you
are not even a man!

01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:25.375
Just think how mad I would be?

01:23:28.667 --> 01:23:31.208
I could have finished him
off at some remote place.

01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:33.292
Why do you think I did
this in front of you?

01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:36.250
Everything has a reasoning
to it, Sethupathi.

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.042
Don't you know very well?

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:43.167
I will henceforth decide
every incident of your life.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:45.375
Fine...

01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:47.458
Now rush to your home.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:48.667
Let him go.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.583
I say this for your own good.

01:23:51.667 --> 01:23:54.292
Didn't you leave the door open?
Now run.

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:56.167
You tried to take me
for a ride, is it?

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:24.167
What happened?

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.083
Tell me...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.917
What's up Sethu? Reached home?

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.125
I hope your family is fine?

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:38.875
They are fine. Didn't I tell you?

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.167
I'll be deciding your life hereafter.

01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:46.250
I haven't started yet. So until then
have a good time with your family.

01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:47.667
Sounds fine?

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.750
Who am I?

01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:53.125
Who am I?

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.833
Now come on tell me...

01:24:56.542 --> 01:24:57.750
Who am I?

01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.458
Who am I?

01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:02.708
Who am I?

01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:05.208
Now let me tell you...

01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:07.125
so listen.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:10.167
I am the king.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.917
I am the king.

01:25:13.083 --> 01:25:17.833
In every land, I am the king.

01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:22.083
I am the king. I am THE king.

01:25:22.208 --> 01:25:26.542
Forever I am the king.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.167
Touch me and you'll be ashes...

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.500
Provoke me and I'll
turn into a volcano!

01:25:32.583 --> 01:25:35.083
I'll beat you down in no time.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:37.500
Come try challenging me.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.833
I break the rules because I
don't care who make the rules.

01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:46.000
Question me and I'll beat you down!
So make a move.

01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:48.417
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:50.667
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.667
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:55.167
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.417
I have conquered all
and I have no limits.

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:23.250
If you are a hunter remember you
have to hunt to make your living.

01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:28.042
I don't care who made the laws.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:32.583
I'll destroy everything that comes
in my way. That's all I got to say.

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:37.500
No matter what, I draw
the first blood....

01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:42.208
That is all, there would be nothing
left in the enemy to revolt.

01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:53.333
I am the king.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:58.208
I am the king. I am THE king.

01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:04.792
I, me, myself am the King.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.500
- Listen. That cop's wife is here.
- When did she come?

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:39.292
Just now. You tell me.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.333
You'll be soon fine. Ok?

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:47.458
Your husband shot him and now
are you here to finish him off?

01:27:47.583 --> 01:27:50.958
- Get lost. I said get lost.
- Please don't yell.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:54.375
Who wants your compliments?
Take it along with you.

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:57.625
I curse you people! Now get lost!

01:27:57.875 --> 01:28:00.750
Your family will suffer.
Your kids will suffer too...

01:28:00.958 --> 01:28:04.042
Look what you have done to me.
You people will suffer bad.

01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:08.875
Now get lost!

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.667
Look what your husband has done.

01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:31.583
Hey...

01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:35.500
Where have you been?

01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:36.375
To the temple.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.458
Is the temple situated inside
the government hospital?

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:42.458
Did I request you?

01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:45.667
To find an alternative
to get my job back?

01:28:47.958 --> 01:28:50.417
I got a call asking if I've started
sending you to beg on my behalf!

01:28:52.667 --> 01:28:53.667
Do I look like that?

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:56.583
Why did you do this?

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.833
- Why did you do this?
- Mom can hear us. Let's talk later.

01:29:00.875 --> 01:29:01.958
Can't you hear me?

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:06.417
Now what is this?

01:29:06.792 --> 01:29:08.583
Wipe off the paint.
Look at your face.

01:29:09.167 --> 01:29:11.375
Look at mom, playing
with the paint.

01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:15.208
Daddy has a small work to take care of.
I'll be back. Now go to mom.

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:16.042
Bye...

01:29:19.167 --> 01:29:21.792
My darling. Come here dear.

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:24.375
My darling...

01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:28.792
Both of us playing
and I stumbled...

01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:30.500
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:36.292
- My darling.
- Look here.

01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:38.875
Pack your things.

01:29:38.917 --> 01:29:41.042
You can return after his
problems are solved.

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.417
If this is happening when I am
around, what about when I'm not?

01:29:45.417 --> 01:29:46.083
Look here...

01:29:46.708 --> 01:29:49.042
If he has thrashed me now, later
he'll return to pamper me.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.208
I should be here for that.

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:53.500
If you want to leave,
you better leave.

01:29:56.708 --> 01:29:57.458
You come dear.

01:30:01.917 --> 01:30:04.250
Yes sir. Everything's ready.
I'll come there in 5 mins.

01:30:04.542 --> 01:30:06.958
Ok sir. Bye sir.

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:21.125
Sir.

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:28.000
Look if it is this nail
that punctured it.

01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:42.292
Sir please.

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:44.417
Sir please. I don't have money.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.417
Sir I don't have any money with me.
Please sir.

01:30:47.792 --> 01:30:49.417
- Now who asked?
- Sir please.

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:51.375
- Now who asked you money?
- Sir please.

01:30:51.917 --> 01:30:54.208
- I don't have any money.
- Who asked you money?

01:30:54.625 --> 01:30:57.250
- Awesome Karthi. Awesome.
- Who asked you?

01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:59.792
Hey Inspector!! Amazing!!!

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:14.000
Karthi, now come on. Come back.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.083
Seems like he bashed you up.

01:31:23.167 --> 01:31:25.750
He knew he fell into the trap.
What else could have he done?

01:31:26.042 --> 01:31:29.375
- Send this to the lady in the commission. She'll take care of the rest.
- Ok.

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:36.083
Look at this.

01:31:36.542 --> 01:31:38.625
This is his atrocity when
he is not in charge.

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:41.958
Who would believe that
he did not shoot?

01:31:42.625 --> 01:31:43.750
Now what is all this about?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.792
Do you think we are jobless?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.958
Who is answerable
to our superiors?

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:51.750
All these days I was being
considerate because you said so.

01:31:51.958 --> 01:31:53.750
Let's finish of this
case once and forever.

01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:56.875
Sir, I haven't submitted
any evidence yet.

01:31:57.292 --> 01:32:01.125
What are you going to do? You will put
the blame on the victim and get away?

01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:04.250
We are running out of time.
You may leave.

01:32:05.667 --> 01:32:06.542
Are you running out of time?

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:10.375
He set ablaze the cop who was
supposed to be my witness...

01:32:11.083 --> 01:32:12.958
...and swears at me saying that
I'm nothing without the uniform.

01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.042
I couldn't do anything about it.

01:32:16.375 --> 01:32:19.667
I would try finding out another witness
but you say you are out of time.

01:32:21.167 --> 01:32:22.208
Anyway thanks madam.

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.667
You would set up some of
your men from the station.

01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:27.000
- We can't accept them as witness.
- Wait madam.

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.458
First, let him bring the witness.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.917
We will then decide
if it is true or not.

01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:33.375
Bring your witness day
after tomorrow morning.

01:32:34.292 --> 01:32:35.375
Ok sir. Thank you.

01:32:40.667 --> 01:32:42.750
- Yes tell me.
- Listen to me carefully.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:48.500
Sethupathi has claimed to bring a
police constable as his witness.

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:49.917
- Be careful.
- I'm on my way.

01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:52.458
No problem. I'll manage.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.292
He can do nothing! Start the vehicle.

01:32:56.583 --> 01:32:57.417
No nothing like...

01:32:58.708 --> 01:32:59.500
Idiot...

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.792
It's Sethu...

01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:09.250
He is getting away. Follow. Follow him.
Get a video. Now!

01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:10.042
Start. Quick!

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:12.417
- Give me that phone.
- Move! Move!

01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.042
Go! Go! Come on shoot!

01:33:14.542 --> 01:33:15.500
He is trapped.

01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:17.500
I'll send this video
right away to that lady.

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.708
Now shoot your video.

01:33:34.417 --> 01:33:37.792
Start the vehicle. Come on.
Start the vehicle.

01:33:38.125 --> 01:33:39.583
Get in. Get in. Quick!

01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:42.583
Start. I said start!

01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:57.500
Sir..no please.

01:34:02.167 --> 01:34:02.667
Sir...

01:34:02.833 --> 01:34:03.667
No don't.

01:34:12.167 --> 01:34:13.000
No don't.

01:34:15.625 --> 01:34:17.292
You'll be in trouble
if uncle gets to know.

01:34:38.958 --> 01:34:39.792
No Sethu...

01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:44.458
Sethu, no.

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:53.250
Sethu, please don't.

01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:56.625
Sethu, don't.

01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:03.333
Sethu, no.

01:35:12.292 --> 01:35:13.583
It hurts..

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.958
Please, it hurts.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.500
What did I tell you?

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:22.708
What have you done?

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.458
Didn't I tell you in the morning?

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:25.583
Sir, Sethu is on his way here.

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:26.875
Gather our guys.

01:35:50.208 --> 01:35:52.167
Butcher him if he nears.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.875
Hey Darling!

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:22.500
I'm starving.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.792
I'll get the food. You leave.

01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:27.000
What the...

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.458
Now what?

01:37:29.167 --> 01:37:30.958
Why did you put off the stove?

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.833
Look into my eyes and speak.

01:37:36.667 --> 01:37:38.083
I won't. Tell me.

01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:41.500
Fine...

01:37:42.333 --> 01:37:43.125
Sorry.

01:37:44.417 --> 01:37:45.875
Didn't you realize this earlier?

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:49.750
Fine...

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.292
Sorry

01:37:56.625 --> 01:37:58.750
I apologized. Do you want
me to fall at your feet?

01:37:59.917 --> 01:38:01.292
Why are you behaving like this?

01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:03.583
Yes....

01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:07.333
Fall at my feet.

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.250
- Come now. What?
- Leave.

01:38:21.417 --> 01:38:22.375
Oh! Oh!

01:38:23.708 --> 01:38:24.958
Did that hurt? Sorry.

01:38:26.292 --> 01:38:30.292
- Sorry. Are we good?
- Cut the drama...

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.458
Now fall at my feet.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.458
Fine darling! Forgive
this husband.

01:38:48.458 --> 01:38:50.917
Hey! I just fell at your feet.

01:38:53.583 --> 01:38:54.917
I apologized too.

01:38:55.458 --> 01:38:57.208
Have some sympathy
for your husband.

01:38:57.583 --> 01:38:58.083
Please.

01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:04.375
Fatso...

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:05.583
Rogue.

01:39:05.792 --> 01:39:07.917
- Now what?
- What?

01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:09.958
You are under arrest.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:14.458
He shot a young boy.

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.125
That boy is just 17 yrs old.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.833
If he were dead, we won't be
sitting down for this case.

01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:22.208
You are taking advantage of the
fact that he is still alive.

01:39:22.458 --> 01:39:23.375
This is unfair.

01:39:23.667 --> 01:39:27.083
That doesn't mean we cannot
listen to his statement.

01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:29.000
That is why this commission
has been set up.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.167
Everything about this is
evident to the whole world...

01:39:31.292 --> 01:39:33.500
and now whom have you got
from your department?

01:39:33.833 --> 01:39:37.167
I'm 100% sure this is
cooked up witness.

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:39.667
How can you say it is cooked up?

01:39:39.917 --> 01:39:41.750
We can't bluntly accept
your assumptions.

01:39:41.792 --> 01:39:43.667
We can find the truth
only after investigation.

01:39:43.667 --> 01:39:44.958
I will investigate this case.

01:39:45.292 --> 01:39:47.250
If your are willing stay
in this commission.

01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:48.042
If not,

01:39:48.167 --> 01:39:52.208
Give a written statement that your aren't
willing to participate and leave.

01:39:53.167 --> 01:39:54.125
Please come in.

01:39:55.417 --> 01:39:58.250
- Ask that police constable to come in.
- Ok sir.

01:40:05.083 --> 01:40:09.833
Is it true that you tried replacing
dummy bullets in his gun?

01:40:11.125 --> 01:40:12.208
He is lying.

01:40:12.958 --> 01:40:14.375
I've got nothing to do with it.

01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:16.458
He is threatening me.

01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:19.958
I told you! Now you
guys handle this case.

01:40:20.333 --> 01:40:23.625
I'll submit my reports. You guys
keep entertaining further witnesses.

01:40:42.708 --> 01:40:43.208
Sir...

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.000
Please come in.

01:40:46.167 --> 01:40:48.667
- So, how are you?
- I am fine.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.542
Please have a seat.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.792
Now tell us what happened?

01:40:57.208 --> 01:40:59.958
Do you think I am fool. Why did
you lie during the investigation?

01:41:00.375 --> 01:41:02.458
- What are you talking about?
- Now, tell the truth.

01:41:02.667 --> 01:41:05.125
Do you think we are fools
to fall for your lies.

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:07.167
Now tell us or shall I
put you behind the bars?

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:09.000
I'll shall confess.

01:41:09.292 --> 01:41:11.542
I tried replacing the
bullets in inspector's gun.

01:41:12.042 --> 01:41:13.375
I was all set to confess...

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:17.167
...but Vaathiyar's hench
men abducted my daughter.

01:41:25.458 --> 01:41:26.458
Auto...

01:41:27.792 --> 01:41:29.208
There she comes. You leave.

01:41:30.208 --> 01:41:31.833
Stop.

01:41:33.292 --> 01:41:34.208
Hey!

01:41:34.583 --> 01:41:36.708
My daughter reached home
safe as I lied to you.

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:38.000
My daughter is very dear to me.

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:41.167
- Please save my family.
- Get up! - Get up!

01:41:43.833 --> 01:41:47.542
Who is this Vaathiyar? Re-
investigate all his cases.

01:41:47.792 --> 01:41:49.708
- Does he think we are fools?
- Ok sir.

01:41:53.292 --> 01:41:55.667
- Bro, here.
- Give it .

01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:05.792
Why are you getting into
unnecessary issues?

01:42:06.333 --> 01:42:09.042
- What now?
- Why did you kidnap the police constable's daughter?

01:42:09.042 --> 01:42:11.875
- Which Police constable?
- Did you think that was smart?

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.292
What are you talking about?

01:42:14.042 --> 01:42:14.708
What is it?

01:42:15.708 --> 01:42:16.583
What is it?

01:42:16.625 --> 01:42:19.292
I did request you to be
calm for a little while.

01:42:19.583 --> 01:42:22.833
Nobody would have believed if the police
constable had confessed during the investigation.

01:42:22.833 --> 01:42:25.875
- But now since you kidnapped her daughter...
- Whose daughter?

01:42:26.833 --> 01:42:28.208
So wasn't it us who kidnapped?

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:32.583
Why do you doubt me? Have I ever
done anything without his orders?

01:42:32.667 --> 01:42:35.208
You've been asking the same thing.
We didn't do it!

01:42:36.333 --> 01:42:38.083
- Did you see her off safely?
- Yes sir.

01:42:38.417 --> 01:42:41.000
- We took her and drove around the place
couple of times and then left her go. - Ok

01:42:41.042 --> 01:42:42.625
- You guys leave.
- Ok sir.

01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:48.375
Sir, that was awesome.

01:42:49.125 --> 01:42:52.875
If Muruganandam had confessed earlier,
they would have tried to find faults.

01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:57.542
But kidnapping his daughter
was the icing on the cake.

01:42:57.583 --> 01:43:00.292
Vaathiyar is trapped
and we too are safe.

01:43:01.917 --> 01:43:03.583
But this won't be
enough to stop them.

01:43:04.292 --> 01:43:06.167
We should make them suffer even more.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.167
How dare they mess
with the cops?

01:43:09.792 --> 01:43:11.500
He isn't that worthy.

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:14.250
Let me get back to the job...

01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:16.125
Do one thing...

01:43:16.667 --> 01:43:19.083
You come to the commission office
on Monday. We'll discuss there.

01:43:19.125 --> 01:43:20.875
Give it to me.
Listen Sethupathi...

01:43:21.083 --> 01:43:25.167
Your re-appointment is confirmed. Shave
and show up on Monday. Now hang up.

01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:28.125
Stop beating around the bush.

01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:30.958
We shouldn't have mercy on him.

01:43:31.667 --> 01:43:34.958
He is tricking us when he has lot of
troubles. Imagine if he is back on duty.

01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:36.375
He won't spare us.

01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:39.125
We should overtake him
before his next plan.

01:43:40.833 --> 01:43:43.958
We must make him suffer for life.
Leave that to me.

01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:46.083
I'll destroy him
without a trace.

01:43:50.417 --> 01:43:51.542
Do it.

01:44:12.292 --> 01:44:15.083
Hey! What is it?

01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:16.542
What is it?

01:44:18.250 --> 01:44:19.292
Nothing officer.

01:44:24.833 --> 01:44:26.958
- Ok start.
- Dude, cops.

01:44:29.792 --> 01:44:30.542
What is it?

01:44:38.292 --> 01:44:40.750
Attack him. Yes... Attack!

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.708
Attack him. Yes... Attack!

01:44:44.583 --> 01:44:46.000
Careful!

01:44:47.167 --> 01:44:47.792
Hold this.

01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:51.917
Sir....

01:44:53.792 --> 01:44:55.708
Start the vehicle. Leave...

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.250
We'll get them!

01:45:37.375 --> 01:45:38.917
Stop. Stop!

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:49.250
- Listen... what happened?
- Nothing sir.

01:45:49.833 --> 01:45:50.875
Did the acid spill on you?

01:45:50.958 --> 01:45:52.083
Idiot. Get down.

01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:54.458
- It's ok sir.
- I said get down.

01:45:54.708 --> 01:45:55.667
Auto hold on.

01:45:57.333 --> 01:45:58.375
I said get down. Now!

01:45:59.458 --> 01:46:01.958
- Sir, it's fine.
- Auto hold on.

01:46:02.417 --> 01:46:04.167
Get in. Go to the hospital.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:06.958
- You be careful sir.
- I'll be fine. You go.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:07.542
Call me.

01:46:16.958 --> 01:46:17.542
Tell me.

01:46:19.208 --> 01:46:20.208
Listen, be clear.

01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:22.250
Someone is there outside.

01:46:22.583 --> 01:46:24.500
I can't understand. Say it clearly.

01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:26.750
There are men all
around the house.

01:46:27.083 --> 01:46:28.375
Don't worry! Don't worry!

01:46:28.583 --> 01:46:30.792
Nothing is going to happen.
I'm on my way.

01:46:30.833 --> 01:46:32.583
- No, don't come.
- I'm coming.

01:46:32.667 --> 01:46:34.417
I am scared.

01:46:35.042 --> 01:46:38.250
No. If you get scared, the
kids will too get scared.

01:46:40.083 --> 01:46:42.375
Listen to me. Take the kids
and go to the bedroom.

01:46:43.375 --> 01:46:45.958
- Mom.
- Have you got inside?

01:46:47.042 --> 01:46:49.625
Lock all the windows.

01:46:50.042 --> 01:46:51.917
Nothing is going to happen.
I am with you.

01:46:52.125 --> 01:46:54.917
- Don't worry dear.
- Give the phone to Maran.

01:46:55.042 --> 01:46:57.458
- For what?
- I said give the phone to Maran.

01:46:58.833 --> 01:47:00.833
- Maraa, are you afraid?
- Dad

01:47:01.125 --> 01:47:03.042
- No dad.
- Listen to daddy.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:04.500
Ok?

01:47:06.375 --> 01:47:07.250
Ok dad.

01:47:07.417 --> 01:47:08.542
Give the phone to mom.

01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:09.792
Hello.

01:47:10.958 --> 01:47:12.833
Where is Maran headed to?

01:47:13.458 --> 01:47:15.917
I'll tell you what will
happen in the next 10 mins.

01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:18.167
So, stop worrying
and listen to me.

01:47:18.208 --> 01:47:19.667
I'll be back.

01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:26.333
Go somewhere where they can
hear you and speak as I say.

01:47:26.625 --> 01:47:27.125
Go.

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:30.208
Mommy!

01:47:30.208 --> 01:47:32.167
I'm on my way.

01:47:33.375 --> 01:47:34.417
Come on.

01:47:35.958 --> 01:47:37.542
Wait. Get behind me.

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.708
Dear, come here.

01:47:47.083 --> 01:47:50.208
What are you doing with her.
Look what Maran is up to.

01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:51.375
Listen...

01:47:52.292 --> 01:47:55.167
- Sethupathi is inside.
- Let's leave.

01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:57.042
How did he?

01:47:57.458 --> 01:48:00.542
Now come, I can't control him.

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.250
Hold on.

01:48:05.458 --> 01:48:05.917
Done.

01:48:06.417 --> 01:48:08.125
Let's leave.

01:48:09.417 --> 01:48:10.125
Wait.

01:48:14.667 --> 01:48:15.667
- Hey
- Yes tell me.

01:48:16.333 --> 01:48:17.833
- He is at home.
- Who?

01:48:18.583 --> 01:48:19.625
- Sethupathi.
- Bro...

01:48:19.917 --> 01:48:21.208
No chance. He must be here.

01:48:21.417 --> 01:48:25.042
- I can hear his wife talking to him.
- He was chasing us just now. He can't be there.

01:48:25.292 --> 01:48:25.833
Fool!

01:48:27.708 --> 01:48:28.917
They won't leave....

01:48:30.542 --> 01:48:34.042
- They'll come back knowing that I'm not there.
- I'm scared.

01:48:34.333 --> 01:48:37.708
- He is here.
- He was chasing us. There is no way he can be there.

01:48:38.167 --> 01:48:39.792
- Confirm?
- Confirm.

01:48:40.125 --> 01:48:42.458
- Confirm?
- Believe me bro.

01:48:42.458 --> 01:48:43.083
Hang up.

01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:47.125
She is bluffing. Break the door.

01:48:47.583 --> 01:48:48.625
How dare she?

01:48:49.125 --> 01:48:51.083
They are breaking the door.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.625
Ok. Fine!

01:48:52.875 --> 01:48:55.292
Break it. Come on!

01:48:57.667 --> 01:49:01.542
- They are breaking in.
- I am with you. Nothing will happen.

01:49:01.708 --> 01:49:02.417
- Go!
- Break it!

01:49:04.875 --> 01:49:07.750
- Break it.
- They are in.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.833
Don't worry. Don't look
like you are scared.

01:49:09.833 --> 01:49:11.375
- Move
- Please come.

01:49:15.417 --> 01:49:16.208
Dear...

01:49:16.792 --> 01:49:19.583
Dear, please come.

01:49:20.208 --> 01:49:23.417
Please come. Our son
is so mischievous.

01:49:26.417 --> 01:49:28.083
Staging a play is it?

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.208
Who is on the call?
Your husband, right?

01:49:31.208 --> 01:49:32.708
Listen inspector...

01:49:32.708 --> 01:49:35.000
Do you want to hear the screams
of your dying wife and kids?

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.500
Hey, has Maran arrived?

01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:41.458
Put the phone on speakers.

01:49:43.833 --> 01:49:44.625
Maraa...

01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:47.125
now hold it firmly and shoot.

01:49:59.375 --> 01:50:02.125
If any of them takes one step forward,
shoot right on their forehead.

01:50:10.833 --> 01:50:12.000
Hold him.

01:50:12.292 --> 01:50:13.083
Hold him.

01:50:13.583 --> 01:50:15.917
Run! Run!

01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:16.958
Warn your husband.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.458
He'll be here in 10 mins. Why
don't you warn him in person?

01:50:19.625 --> 01:50:20.875
- So wait..
- Warn him!

01:50:42.417 --> 01:50:43.375
What happened?

01:50:43.417 --> 01:50:44.000
Uncle...

01:50:46.875 --> 01:50:47.750
They escaped.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.542
I should blame myself
for believing in you.

01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:51.417
Good for nothing.

01:50:51.667 --> 01:50:52.625
How can you let him go?

01:50:52.667 --> 01:50:53.875
He shouldn't get back his job.

01:50:55.042 --> 01:50:57.792
- Isn't the guy whom he shot in the hospital? Finish him.
- Ok uncle.

01:50:57.833 --> 01:50:58.833
Finish him!

01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:01.667
Before I reach home, give me
the news that he is dead.

01:51:01.833 --> 01:51:03.042
- Ok uncle.
- Now go finish!

01:51:03.542 --> 01:51:06.750
Get lost! I can do nothing with you guys.
Get lost! I'll find someone else.

01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:10.000
Where are you guys?

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:24.458
It's Sethu.

01:51:25.708 --> 01:51:26.917
Had your food darling?

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.375
Are the kids asleep?

01:51:32.917 --> 01:51:33.458
Ok fine.

01:51:59.417 --> 01:52:00.083
I guessed it.

01:52:01.458 --> 01:52:03.542
Now why waste time trying
to finish off the boy?

01:53:01.583 --> 01:53:03.250
Come on. Run!

01:53:08.292 --> 01:53:09.292
Come on.

01:53:09.917 --> 01:53:10.750
Break it open.

01:53:14.167 --> 01:53:15.167
Now make it quick!

01:53:15.708 --> 01:53:16.542
Break it!

01:53:20.333 --> 01:53:21.625
Run! Quick!

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:35.958
Go slit his throat! Get in.

01:54:02.208 --> 01:54:03.458
I've already warned you!

01:54:03.917 --> 01:54:05.667
Don't give that look,
it's hilarious.

01:54:06.167 --> 01:54:06.833
Finish him.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:33.917
Sir...

01:54:34.208 --> 01:54:35.375
Let's talk. What do you say?

01:54:36.917 --> 01:54:40.167
Sir no, it hurts. No
sir, please don't.

01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:42.792
Sir no, it hurts. No sir, please don't.

01:54:43.375 --> 01:54:44.625
It hurts. No sir, please don't.

01:54:44.708 --> 01:54:46.542
Oh my god. It hurts.

01:54:46.792 --> 01:54:49.250
Oh my god! Karuppu!

01:54:50.708 --> 01:54:53.083
Karuppu, where are you?

01:54:57.833 --> 01:54:59.208
There he comes, the murderer.

01:54:59.333 --> 01:55:00.542
Don't shout or else I'll stab!

01:55:03.083 --> 01:55:04.542
Sir, do not advance.

01:55:04.917 --> 01:55:06.083
Or else I'll...

01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:07.292
Sir please do not advance.

01:55:07.292 --> 01:55:08.792
I've nothing to do with it.

01:55:11.708 --> 01:55:12.792
You better leave.

01:55:13.458 --> 01:55:14.792
Your hands are trembling.

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:18.667
- Sir.
- You better leave.

01:55:19.667 --> 01:55:21.375
I won't hurt you.

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:24.208
Now leave.

01:55:24.292 --> 01:55:25.167
Oh my god!

01:55:25.417 --> 01:55:27.042
He just slit my child's throat!

01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:29.375
Nothing to worry. Come on.

01:55:29.458 --> 01:55:30.875
Nothing to worry!

01:55:31.083 --> 01:55:33.042
Come now. It's nothing.

01:55:33.125 --> 01:55:34.083
Doctor!

01:55:34.917 --> 01:55:36.083
Doctor!

01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:40.000
Doctor!

01:55:40.167 --> 01:55:42.625
Make it fast. Please treat him.

01:55:42.958 --> 01:55:45.333
- Careful!
- Move him quickly.

01:55:45.375 --> 01:55:47.417
How could he do this?

01:55:49.875 --> 01:55:51.167
Look at my poor son!

01:55:54.583 --> 01:55:57.375
Why? Why would you guys
hurt him like this?

01:55:58.917 --> 01:56:00.417
My dear son!

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.000
Is it true that some unidentified
gang tried to kill you?

01:56:03.083 --> 01:56:05.125
Was it Inspector
Sethupathi who shot you?

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:08.542
It is true that the inspector
took me in for an inquiry.

01:56:09.333 --> 01:56:11.083
Everyone claims that he shot me.

01:56:11.708 --> 01:56:13.000
But he didn't shoot me.

01:56:13.583 --> 01:56:16.833
I saw his gun fall off from
his hands and it fired.

01:56:18.292 --> 01:56:20.875
When I was at the brink of losing my
life, he was the one who save me.

01:56:21.583 --> 01:56:22.708
He is good hearted.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.542
It was us who committed a mistake.

01:56:25.375 --> 01:56:27.792
All these days, the news was
that you shot him.

01:56:27.917 --> 01:56:30.542
Now look, the boy himself said
that the gun wasn't in your hands.

01:56:30.875 --> 01:56:32.083
I was ill these days

01:56:32.542 --> 01:56:34.875
- No. He is lying.
- Nothing else.

01:56:34.917 --> 01:56:36.083
The gun never fell off.
It was with me.

01:56:38.875 --> 01:56:41.708
The boy has changed his words!

01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:46.583
Greetings sir.

01:56:47.042 --> 01:56:50.042
- The boy who was admitted in the hospital..
- I know, what else?

01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:52.000
The case is now in the
hands of Sethupathi

01:56:52.542 --> 01:56:53.917
And he will be furious for sure.

01:56:54.167 --> 01:56:55.375
There is no clue as to what he'll do.

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.667
So...

01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:58.833
- you better surrender...
- Hey!

01:56:59.375 --> 01:57:00.250
How dare you?

01:57:01.042 --> 01:57:01.917
You better leave.

01:57:01.958 --> 01:57:04.125
- Listen, I'm saying this for our safety.
- So?

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:08.833
I've finished off two police
men and I'm still wandering free.

01:57:09.375 --> 01:57:11.708
No matter what charges he presses
against us. He can't do anything.

01:57:11.708 --> 01:57:15.500
When he had an arrest
warrant he made you suffer.

01:57:16.417 --> 01:57:18.542
So there is no guarantee
he will arrest...

01:57:18.833 --> 01:57:19.833
he is a freak!

01:57:20.125 --> 01:57:21.958
He can do anything.

01:57:22.333 --> 01:57:24.958
I said what I felt is right.
I am leaving.

01:57:53.458 --> 01:57:55.083
Why is there petrol everywhere?

01:57:56.208 --> 01:57:57.958
Guys, where are you?

01:57:59.958 --> 01:58:00.667
Mathi...

01:58:00.875 --> 01:58:02.000
Mathi, where are you?

01:58:05.333 --> 01:58:06.625
The door is also locked.

01:58:09.875 --> 01:58:11.042
Who is it?

01:58:22.042 --> 01:58:22.833
No don't.

01:58:23.125 --> 01:58:24.083
Listen to me.

01:58:25.292 --> 01:58:26.417
What are you guys up to?

01:58:26.667 --> 01:58:28.000
Tell me. What are
you guys up to?

01:58:28.583 --> 01:58:29.167
No don't it.

01:58:29.625 --> 01:58:30.875
Don't you mess with me.

01:58:33.542 --> 01:58:34.167
No, don't!

01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:40.458
Listen to me, don't do this.

01:58:47.583 --> 01:58:48.500
No!
