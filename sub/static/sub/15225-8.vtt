01:39.300 --> 01:41.267
Latka!

01:41.300 --> 01:43.133
Oh, Louie, hello.

01:44.434 --> 01:46.667
Just the man I'm looking for.

01:46.701 --> 01:48.634
Do you have the correct time?

01:48.667 --> 01:50.100
My watch stopped.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.434
The correct time is
you're eight minutes late.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.501
Oh, thank you.

01:53.534 --> 01:54.834
Hold it, here, hold it.

01:54.868 --> 01:55.968
This is serious.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.868
I hope you got a good
excuse why you're late.

01:57.901 --> 02:00.734
Well, do you think
that helping someone

02:00.767 --> 02:03.734
who was almost killed
in an automobile accident

02:03.767 --> 02:05.434
is a good excuse?

02:05.467 --> 02:06.200
No.

02:06.234 --> 02:09.300
Then you're going to hate mine.

02:09.334 --> 02:10.300
Hold it, hold it.

02:10.334 --> 02:11.801
I'll let you off
the hook this time

02:11.834 --> 02:13.367
'cause you're
not usually late,

02:13.400 --> 02:14.434
but get to work!

02:14.467 --> 02:15.434
Okay.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.934
Hey, Latka,
is everything okay?

02:17.968 --> 02:19.868
Oh, yeah, everything is fine.

02:19.901 --> 02:23.067
The reason I was late
is because I was dancing

02:23.100 --> 02:25.267
around my apartment
with joy.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.434
Oh, yeah?
Hey, what happened?

02:27.467 --> 02:29.667
My beloved
grandmother died.

02:29.701 --> 02:31.267
That's good news?

02:31.300 --> 02:33.300
No, that's terrible news.

02:33.334 --> 02:36.334
Bobby, what kind
of a person are you?

02:36.367 --> 02:37.567
No.

02:37.601 --> 02:39.567
The-the reason it's good news

02:39.601 --> 02:42.701
is because she left me
something very valuable

02:42.734 --> 02:43.701
in her will.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.267
ALL:
Oooh.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.601
What?
What?

02:46.634 --> 02:48.868
Cookies.

02:52.033 --> 02:54.067
She left you cookies?

02:54.100 --> 02:56.133
But not just any cookies.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.901
See, people used
to come from miles around

02:58.934 --> 03:00.868
just to eat her cookies.

03:00.901 --> 03:03.868
And so last night
I go to the post office

03:03.901 --> 03:05.901
and I pick up the recipe

03:05.934 --> 03:08.767
and the package
with the ingredients

03:08.801 --> 03:11.200
and I baked a batch.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.033
You want to try?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.567
ALL:
Yeah.

03:14.601 --> 03:16.367
I love
grandmothers' cookies.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.701
I love them.

03:17.734 --> 03:19.767
Dig in, I hope you enjoy them.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.467
Well, enjoy.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.834
Well?

03:47.868 --> 03:49.267
What do you say?

03:49.300 --> 03:52.934
Well, they're, uh, not bad.

03:52.968 --> 03:54.467
Did you swallow yet?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.434
Did you swallow?

03:59.467 --> 04:02.934
Mine seems to be
getting larger.

04:02.968 --> 04:06.100
I feel like I'm going to be
chewing for the rest of my life.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.868
You mean, you don't like them?

04:08.901 --> 04:10.033
Well...

04:10.067 --> 04:12.234
it's just...

04:12.267 --> 04:13.400
it's just...

04:13.434 --> 04:15.267
it's just the first taste.

04:15.300 --> 04:18.000
I mean, maybe tomorrow
we could have another bite.

04:18.033 --> 04:20.000
You don't like them.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.701
No, no, no. Latka.

04:21.733 --> 04:24.100
You know,
tastes vary.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.934
Tastes very what?

04:26.968 --> 04:28.000
No, no, no.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.701
Latka, what I'm trying
to say is that, you know,

04:29.734 --> 04:30.701
maybe the people

04:30.734 --> 04:31.868
in your country
would love them,

04:31.901 --> 04:33.367
but they might not taste
the same to the people

04:33.400 --> 04:34.701
in our country.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.434
I mean, that's
perfectly understandable,
don't you think?

04:36.467 --> 04:38.834
I think that
the people in America

04:38.868 --> 04:40.400
will love my cookies.

04:40.434 --> 04:42.801
And I think I am going
to sell them in the stores.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.367
That's it, Latka.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.934
I told you to get back
to work, you foreign dog.

04:47.968 --> 04:49.767
Now get back to work.

04:49.801 --> 04:51.434
What? Foreign dog?

04:51.467 --> 04:54.267
I don't have to take
this from you.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.234
I don't even
need this job.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.067
I have the cookies.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.968
And I am going
to be rich and famous

05:01.000 --> 05:03.133
just like
the famous Amos--

05:03.167 --> 05:05.934
the chocolate chip
cookie tycoon.

05:05.968 --> 05:08.200
Oh, yeah? Latka,
I'm warning you.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.133
No, Louie,
 <i>I'm</i> warning <i>you.</i>

05:10.167 --> 05:12.934
You're warning me
when I'm warning you?

05:12.968 --> 05:14.367
I am warning you.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.400
Yeah? You're warning me?

05:16.434 --> 05:18.067
Yes. I am quitting.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.167
Oh, no, you're not, Latka.
You're not going to quit,

05:20.200 --> 05:22.501
because I'm going to fire you.

05:22.534 --> 05:24.701
You cannot fire me
if I am going to quit.

05:24.734 --> 05:27.167
No, no, no. You can't quit
because I'm firing you!

05:27.200 --> 05:29.501
But you cannot fire me
if I quit first.

05:29.534 --> 05:30.868
I quit!
You're fired!

05:30.901 --> 05:32.234
I said it first.

05:32.267 --> 05:33.000
No, you didn't.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.067
I quit!
You're fired!

05:34.100 --> 05:35.400
I said it first again.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.701
It doesn't matter
who says it first.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.300
It's who says it loudest.

05:39.334 --> 05:40.634
You're fired!

05:40.667 --> 05:42.667
You're fired! You're fired!
You're fired!

05:42.701 --> 05:43.934
I quit! I quit!
I quit!

05:43.968 --> 05:46.434
I can't hear you.
You're fired!
You're fired!

05:46.467 --> 05:48.300
I can't hear you.
I quit! I quit! I quit!

05:48.334 --> 05:51.200
You're fired! You're fired!
You're fired!

05:51.234 --> 05:53.534
Okay.

05:53.567 --> 05:54.968
But I quit.

05:56.734 --> 05:58.634
You're fired.

06:05.734 --> 06:06.934
I'm fired.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.133
You quit!

06:08.167 --> 06:09.667
Thank you very much.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.701
How you doing, Jeff?

06:20.734 --> 06:22.501
The engine's
back together.

06:22.534 --> 06:24.868
Got a few pieces
left over.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.868
Close enough.

06:30.901 --> 06:33.434
I'll give this cab to Wheeler.

06:34.968 --> 06:36.234
Louie.

06:36.267 --> 06:38.968
I don't know what I'm doing.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.868
It's only temporary--
just until I can find somebody

06:41.901 --> 06:44.601
who will work as cheap
as the guy I fired.

06:44.634 --> 06:46.334
ALL:
He quit!

06:50.901 --> 06:52.634
Hey, Lou,
want to have

06:52.667 --> 06:54.167
one of Latka's
cookies?

06:54.200 --> 06:56.801
I don't want any
of his crummy cookies

06:56.834 --> 07:00.234
and I don't his name
mentioned in this garage again.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.501
Why, Lou?

07:01.534 --> 07:03.067
You miss him?

07:03.100 --> 07:06.067
I had gas I miss
more than the guy I fired.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.801
ALL:
He quit!

07:12.334 --> 07:15.968
You know, I'm really
starting to like these.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.934
I don't actually like them,
but they're fun to chew.

07:19.968 --> 07:21.534
Yeah, I know what you mean.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.234
They kind of grow on you.

07:23.267 --> 07:25.534
And they last forever
in your mouth.

07:25.567 --> 07:28.267
I put one
on the bedpost last night.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.534
Started on it again
this morning.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.734
Grandma Gravas' cookies
might catch on.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.033
I understand there are
four stores willing to
try them out.

07:36.067 --> 07:38.234
Hmm?
Yeah.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.000
Can you imagine
Latka rich?

07:43.601 --> 07:44.934
I'm back!

07:44.968 --> 07:47.400
Hey, Jim!

07:48.868 --> 07:50.634
Hey, Jim,
welcome back.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.567
ELAINE:
So how was your trip?

07:52.601 --> 07:53.868
Ah, great.

07:53.901 --> 07:57.033
Omaha is lovely
this time of year.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.801
I thought you were hitchhiking
to Washington.

07:59.834 --> 08:03.601
I did too,
but I ended up in Omaha.

08:03.634 --> 08:07.300
I must have used
the wrong thumb.

08:07.334 --> 08:10.400
LOUIE:
All right, let's get
some cabs on the road here.

08:10.434 --> 08:12.367
Nardo, 316!

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
Yeah, just a second.

08:14.434 --> 08:17.367
Wheeler, 441!

08:17.400 --> 08:19.567
Banta, 221!

08:19.601 --> 08:21.234
Rieger, 544!

08:21.267 --> 08:23.400
See you guys.

08:23.434 --> 08:24.934
Hey, Jim.

08:24.968 --> 08:25.968
Uh-huh?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.267
( <i>mumbling</i> )

08:31.667 --> 08:34.067
It's great to <i>be</i> back!

08:36.299 --> 08:37.734
( <i>sighs</i> )

08:37.767 --> 08:39.567
Well, boss...

08:39.601 --> 08:42.067
I'm back from my vacation.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.067
You didn't happen to
run into your brains

08:44.100 --> 08:46.200
while you were out there,
did you?

08:46.234 --> 08:49.100
No, but I wasn't really looking.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.901
Well, I'll have
a cab for you

08:53.934 --> 08:55.400
in a minute,
Gulliver.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.767
Okay.

08:58.801 --> 09:01.100
What's all these cookies?

09:01.133 --> 09:03.934
They were baked
by a guy I fired.

09:03.968 --> 09:05.434
ALL:
He quit!

09:10.634 --> 09:12.701
Ooh!

09:12.734 --> 09:17.534
They got a nice
little surprise inside.

09:17.567 --> 09:20.067
What are you talking about?

09:20.100 --> 09:22.634
Well, I could be wrong...

09:22.667 --> 09:25.167
but I detect something in here

09:25.200 --> 09:28.634
that's a lot more
powerful than oatmeal.

09:30.534 --> 09:32.667
What's in them?
What's in them?

09:32.701 --> 09:35.501
Well, let's check
this out here.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.167
Coca leaves.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.033
Coca leaves?

09:52.067 --> 09:53.634
Uh-huh.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.334
You mean, the stuff
they make cocaine out of?

09:55.367 --> 09:57.467
Yeah.

09:57.501 --> 10:00.133
Yeah, from, uh...

10:00.167 --> 10:02.567
South America.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.934
( <i>sniffing</i> )

10:16.534 --> 10:18.534
Peru, I believe.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.234

10:27.701 --> 10:29.534
Southern Peru.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.234
'74, before the rains.

10:45.167 --> 10:48.067
Poignant,
but not overbearing.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.000
Are you telling me

10:53.033 --> 10:55.734
that Latka is selling
cookies with drugs in them?

10:55.767 --> 10:56.868
Yeah.

11:00.601 --> 11:03.801
Well, my duty as
a citizen is clear-cut.

11:03.834 --> 11:04.834
Yeah.
Jeff?

11:04.868 --> 11:07.033
Get the police
on the phone.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.868
What do these, uh,
coca leaves do to you?

11:09.901 --> 11:12.300
Well, if you chew them
for a while

11:12.334 --> 11:16.367
you get a feeling of euphoria,

11:16.400 --> 11:17.901
increased energy,

11:17.934 --> 11:19.701
strength and stamina.

11:21.501 --> 11:26.400
It's also rumored
to heighten your sexual desires.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.634
And it makes
you see beauty

11:30.667 --> 11:33.901
in the most
repulsive things.

11:50.934 --> 11:53.200
Did anyone ever tell you

11:53.234 --> 11:56.968
that you have
the most adorable ear?

12:03.067 --> 12:05.267
Police are on
the phone, Louie.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.167
Tell them to mind
their own business.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.067
( <i>chuckling</i> )

12:34.300 --> 12:36.400
Oh, Elaine?

12:38.567 --> 12:40.100
She's not here.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.300
What you got there, Lou?

12:41.334 --> 12:42.534
Ah, nothing.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.868
( <i>chuckling</i> )

12:47.901 --> 12:49.200
Hey, Lou!

12:49.234 --> 12:51.801
Have you been noticing anything
strange about me lately?

12:51.834 --> 12:53.534
Uh... strange?

12:53.567 --> 12:54.868
Yeah.

12:54.901 --> 12:56.601
No, no, no.

12:56.634 --> 12:57.868
Nothing strange.

12:57.901 --> 12:59.133
I don't know.

12:59.167 --> 13:02.467
Feel like I'm
sort of... happy.

13:02.501 --> 13:04.901
I got all this
energy, you know?

13:04.934 --> 13:06.133
Uh-huh.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.667
So last night

13:07.701 --> 13:09.634
I had a little trouble
falling asleep,

13:09.667 --> 13:11.133
so I wrote an opera.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.501
An-an opera?

13:16.534 --> 13:19.067
Yeah. I never thought
about writing an opera before,

13:19.100 --> 13:20.534
but it sounded
like it would be fun.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.267
It was. I'm going to write
another one tonight.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.701
It just looks
like, to me

13:28.734 --> 13:30.968
that you're
in a good mood.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.100
Yeah, well, maybe.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.367
I wonder if any of the others
are feeling this way?

13:50.234 --> 13:52.167
I haven't noticed anything.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.701
Hi, guys.

13:58.033 --> 14:00.434
Hey, Bob!

14:00.467 --> 14:01.634
What are you doing?

14:01.667 --> 14:02.767
Huh?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.434
What are you doing?

14:04.467 --> 14:06.067
 <i>Afternoon Of The Faun.</i>

14:09.667 --> 14:12.767
There is definitely
something weird going on here.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.334
Hello.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.534
Oh, Elaine.

14:15.567 --> 14:16.734
Listen, uh...

14:16.767 --> 14:18.634
Uh... Nardo.

14:18.667 --> 14:19.934
Have a cookie?

14:19.968 --> 14:22.300
Oh, yes, thank you.

14:22.334 --> 14:23.467
I've run out.

14:23.501 --> 14:25.067
Louie, I've
been having

14:25.100 --> 14:27.534
the most incredible
perceptions today.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.367
Do you realize the entire
human experience of the universe

14:31.400 --> 14:33.901
can be summed up
in one sentence?

14:33.934 --> 14:35.501
Do I! Hold that thought.

14:35.534 --> 14:38.934
Why don't you come on
into my cage here

14:38.968 --> 14:41.200
and we'll talk
about that...

14:41.234 --> 14:42.801
and sit right there...

14:42.834 --> 14:47.400
and we'll have
some <i>cookies...</i>

14:47.434 --> 14:49.400
and a touch of the bubbly

14:49.434 --> 14:53.734
to wash them down your
pretty little gullet.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.300
No, no, no, Louie.

14:55.334 --> 14:56.634
Louie, I'm serious.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.334
I don't know why I never
saw it before.

14:59.367 --> 15:02.334
I have verifiable proof
of the existence of God.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.968
Later, later--
this stuff gets flat.

15:14.033 --> 15:17.200
Damn it, I'm telling you
there's something wrong here.

15:17.234 --> 15:20.601
Bobby Wheeler is turning
into a gazelle...

15:20.634 --> 15:23.567
Elaine Nardo is in
the chamber of horrors...

15:23.601 --> 15:25.767
Here's the weirdest thing
of all.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.968
I'm standing here in the garage
on my day off.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.567
And I came in here just because
I wanted, uh...

15:31.601 --> 15:34.534
some more cookies...

15:34.567 --> 15:36.367
Hey, Lou!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.868
There's something wrong
with these cookies.

15:38.901 --> 15:40.767
Rieger,
you're being a real drip.

15:40.801 --> 15:42.701
No, I'm telling you, Lou,
it's the cookies;

15:42.734 --> 15:44.334
they're doing something to us.

15:44.367 --> 15:47.367
No, everybody's
just having a good time.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.400
Look at Banta, here.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.701
He's eaten a billion
of them.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.968
There's nothing
the matter with him.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.367
Tony, how you feeling?

15:55.400 --> 15:56.467
I'm fine.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.000
Eh!

15:58.033 --> 16:00.000
Ah, well,
maybe you're right.

16:00.033 --> 16:02.634
Maybe I <i>am</i> imagining it.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.234
Anybody want any coffee?

16:04.267 --> 16:05.868
ALEX:
Yeah, I'll have some.

17:19.334 --> 17:20.634
Hello, Alex.

17:20.666 --> 17:21.767
How are you?

Fine. Lat...

About 24 bags by tomorrow...

supermarket, you know...
Look, Latka...

17:29.667 --> 17:31.834
Isn't it wonderful
how so much success

17:31.868 --> 17:33.734
I'm having with these cookies?
Everyone loves them so much!

17:33.767 --> 17:36.133
You know, and I'm going
to be rich and famous

17:36.167 --> 17:37.467
like Famous Amos, you know,

17:37.501 --> 17:39.200
but, you know,
I would trade it all

17:39.234 --> 17:42.167
if I would only stop talking
for one minute.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.400
Latka, Latka, stop.

17:45.434 --> 17:46.801
Latka, listen to me.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.167
There's a <i>drug</i>
in those cookies.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.200
( <i>gasps</i> )

17:49.234 --> 17:52.334
No...

17:52.367 --> 17:53.667
no.

17:53.701 --> 17:55.300
No...
Now, Latka,

17:55.334 --> 17:57.133
Jim says there's
coca leaves in them.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.133
What?

17:58.167 --> 17:59.133
Coca leaves.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.167
Coca leaves?

18:03.601 --> 18:06.901
Oh... that must be
the secret ingredient.

18:06.934 --> 18:08.100
Right.

18:08.133 --> 18:10.501
That means it's
going to ruin me.

18:10.534 --> 18:12.834
I will not be able
to sell my cookies anymore.

18:12.868 --> 18:14.234
Well, I'm sorry
about that.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.400
Now I cannot do it
and my dream is gone.

18:16.434 --> 18:17.767
Oh. No.

18:17.801 --> 18:20.400
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

18:27.400 --> 18:29.968
This explains why
my grandmother's cookies

18:30.000 --> 18:31.901
were so popular with musicians
in my country.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.734
Latka, you think
your grandmother knew

18:38.767 --> 18:40.968
that there was a drug
in these cookies?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.834
Oh, no, no, no.
She would not know that.

18:42.868 --> 18:45.467
She was a very good woman, Alex.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.968
A very <i>busy,</i> good woman.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.300
She was always knitting doilies,
you know?

18:50.334 --> 18:52.000
A doily here,
a doily there,
Yeah.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.367
doilies everywhere.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.300
"Merry Christmas, Latka.
Here is a doily for you."

18:56.334 --> 18:58.100
Oh, everywhere you look
is doilies.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.200
I'd like to give you
a doily, you old bag!

19:00.234 --> 19:01.334
I'll give you a doily!

19:01.367 --> 19:03.234
I'll give you a doily!

19:03.267 --> 19:05.234
Latka, Latka, Latka,
calm down. Calm down.

19:05.267 --> 19:08.701
Oh, oh, oh, but what is
happening to me, Alex?

19:08.734 --> 19:11.534
I used to be
such a sweet man.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.667
I used to be so cute
you could eat me up.

19:14.701 --> 19:15.868
Yes, yes, yes.

19:15.901 --> 19:17.100
I know you were.
I know you were.

19:17.133 --> 19:20.501
But that's what happens to you
when you take that drug.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.667
Really?

19:23.701 --> 19:25.367
That's why you got
to kick it

19:25.400 --> 19:27.033
right now, right tonight.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.701
You hear me? You got
to get rid of this.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.367
How am I going to do it?

19:30.400 --> 19:31.667
Well, look, first of all
we got...

19:31.701 --> 19:32.901
No more cookies.
Yeah?

19:32.934 --> 19:35.067
We're going to get rid
of all these cookies.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.067
That's a good idea.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.200
We'll start with this one.

19:37.234 --> 19:39.033
No, no, no.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.033
Latka, sit down.
Sit down.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.434
Listen to me. Look...

19:42.467 --> 19:46.634
It's going to be
a very tough night for you.

19:46.667 --> 19:47.968
I mean, you're going
to get nervous,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
you're going to get anxious.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.067
You might even get sick.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.067
You might even
have hallucinations, delirium.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.901
Latka, you're looking at
the worst night of your life.

19:55.934 --> 19:57.267
Now, I don't want you
to worry about it.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.701
I'm going to be right here

19:58.734 --> 20:00.868
going through the whole thing
with you.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.767
Thank you very much.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.667
Alex, all my dreams
are gone.

20:05.701 --> 20:08.567
I thought I was going
to be rich and famous

20:08.601 --> 20:10.567
like the Famous Amos. See?

20:10.601 --> 20:12.033
But now is nothing.

20:12.067 --> 20:17.767
I thought I was going to finally
get out of the garage.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.567
You know, I did not
want to be rich

20:19.601 --> 20:22.033
for the same reasons that
other men want to be rich.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.033
Oh, you mean not for the houses,
the cars or the women?

20:24.067 --> 20:28.100
Oh, maybe it <i>was</i>
the same reasons.

20:30.901 --> 20:33.067
But you know,
I want to think...

20:33.100 --> 20:34.400
but... you know...

20:34.434 --> 20:35.734
you know...

20:35.767 --> 20:37.033
Let's try to get
some sleep, all right?

20:37.067 --> 20:38.367
I'll try.
I don't know if I could.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.834
I'm going to stay up and
watch you all night, okay?

20:41.868 --> 20:43.234
All right, thank you.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.434
Famous Amos.

21:18.601 --> 21:21.133
I... I don't believe it.

21:21.167 --> 21:24.434
What's happening, Latka?

21:24.467 --> 21:25.801
I don't know.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.467
What's happening to you?

21:28.501 --> 21:31.067
Boy. Welcome to my home.

21:31.100 --> 21:35.167
Thank you,
but I'm not really here.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.534
You're hallucinating.

21:39.067 --> 21:41.133
Well, then
welcome to my mind.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.934
If I knew you were coming

21:42.968 --> 21:45.133
I would have
cleaned it up a bit.

21:45.167 --> 21:49.934
Listen, man, I heard
what happened to your cookies.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.667
It's a tough break.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.267
Oh, that's nice
of you to say.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.334
I came by because
I wanted to say that

21:57.367 --> 22:01.300
success, fame, fortune--
all that stuff--

22:01.334 --> 22:03.334
it's truly overrated.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.534
Oh.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.934
I wanted to tell you

22:05.968 --> 22:08.534
that the really
important things in life

22:08.567 --> 22:10.133
are the simple things.

I'd like to tell you
all of those things, Latka,

22:19.801 --> 22:21.601
but I can't.
Why?

22:21.634 --> 22:22.667
'Cause it's a crock.

22:22.701 --> 22:23.667
A crock?

22:23.701 --> 22:24.701
That's right,
a crock.

Yeah?

Oh...

to be successful

'cause it's great.
Great.

And if it happens overnight,
it's even better.

Nothing at all.

These are wonderful words.

you know?

22:55.767 --> 22:56.734
Well, thank you
very much.

22:56.767 --> 22:57.767

very important about myself.

Alex, I want
to be richer than anything.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.901
I want to be richer
than the Joneses.

I want to make lots of money,
as much as I can.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.434
I want to be rolling in money.
