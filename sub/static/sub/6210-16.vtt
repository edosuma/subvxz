00:01.867 --> 00:03.467
<i>Rose are red</i>
<i>Violets are blue,</i>

00:03.468 --> 00:05.670
<i>You remind me</i>
<i>Of primordial goo.</i>

00:05.671 --> 00:07.571
And they said I couldn't
find a card for Libby.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.709
Oh, no. I'm
losing my hair.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.178
Yesterday, I counted six hairs
in my kitty comb.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.879
Today, there's ten.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.581
Eleven.
( gasps )

00:16.582 --> 00:18.984
Do you think Harvey and I
might be soul mates?

00:18.985 --> 00:20.151
Depends.

00:20.152 --> 00:22.386
Would you still love him
if he was bald?

00:22.387 --> 00:23.354
Of course.

00:23.355 --> 00:25.757
Unless he did that weird
comb-over thing.

00:25.758 --> 00:26.991
Ooh. Twelve.

00:26.992 --> 00:28.960
Ugh. Sabrina, you gotta help me.

00:28.961 --> 00:31.429
( whimpers ):
I don't want to be
a chrome dome.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.366
Mm. I like it.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.835
But can I swim in it?

00:38.838 --> 00:41.106

00:55.121 --> 00:56.955
No channel surfing.

01:02.694 --> 01:05.396
Sabrina, hurry up.
It's time for breakfast.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.533
I'm coming.
You don't have to--

01:08.534 --> 01:10.835
Have my room attacked
by Huns.

01:10.836 --> 01:13.471
Looks like somebody's
made Cupid angry.

01:13.472 --> 01:15.573
Well, he is a lonely,
bitter man.

01:15.574 --> 01:18.143
"Sabrina, because you meddled
in the laws of love,

01:18.144 --> 01:20.645
and tried to break up your
Aunt Zelda and Mr. Kraft..."

01:20.646 --> 01:22.013
How does he know that?

01:22.014 --> 01:24.015
It's Cupid's job
to know those things.

01:24.016 --> 01:27.385
And I might have mentioned it
to him at a cocktail party.

01:27.386 --> 01:30.188
"You must help two people
fall in love by Valentine's Day,

01:30.189 --> 01:31.956
"or spend weekends
picking up trash

01:31.957 --> 01:33.591
along the Other Realm
interstate."

01:33.592 --> 01:35.093
Ew. I don't want to
spend my time

01:35.094 --> 01:37.995
chained to a bunch of
drunks in orange jumpsuits.

01:37.996 --> 01:39.364
Well, they're not
all drunks.

01:39.365 --> 01:40.532
Some are murderers.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.236
Look. I really
am losing my hair.

01:45.571 --> 01:48.573
Oh wait. That's my butt.
( chuckles )

01:48.574 --> 01:50.709
But who am I
gonna set up?

01:50.710 --> 01:52.744
Well, let's see.
There's--

01:52.745 --> 01:54.712
I just met the most
amazing guy.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.147
See, Hilda.

01:56.148 --> 01:59.217
I knew that polka class at
Learning Annex would pay off.

01:59.218 --> 02:00.885
Where's your lollipop,
Kojak?

02:00.886 --> 02:01.953
( growls )

02:01.954 --> 02:04.823
Anyway, Carlton's smart,
handsome, funny.

02:04.824 --> 02:06.457
Absolutely nothing
like Willard.

02:06.458 --> 02:07.625
SABRINA:
I knew you'd like him.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.660
Well, that takes care of
my assignment.

02:09.661 --> 02:12.263
Cupid may wear a diaper,
but he's no fool.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.465
And he asked me out
for Valentine's Day.

02:14.466 --> 02:17.268
He's always coming up with
crazy, offbeat ideas like that.

02:17.269 --> 02:18.270
See you.

02:19.638 --> 02:22.140
This is the best time
in a Hilda relationship.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.642
Before she spends
any time with him.

02:25.911 --> 02:27.145
Hey, Sabrina.

02:27.146 --> 02:28.747
Hey. Do you think
that guy's dating anyone?

02:28.748 --> 02:30.881
Yeah. I think he's
dating that guy.

02:30.882 --> 02:32.684
Hey, good news about
Valentine's Day.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.886
My dad's helping that fancy
French restaurant,

02:34.887 --> 02:37.489
Le Petit Chien,
with its roach problem,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.491
and he snagged us
a reservation.
Hm.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.593
One downside to
the restaurant, though:

02:41.594 --> 02:43.161
no salad bar.

02:43.162 --> 02:46.831
Uh, hey, hey.
No PDA in the hallway.

02:46.832 --> 02:49.167
I'm gonna have to
write you both up.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.436
By the by,
hope your Aunt Zelda

02:51.437 --> 02:54.405
doesn't mind Easter candy
for Valentine's.

02:54.406 --> 02:56.641
Mother really wants it
out of the freezer.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.778
Hey. Those two would
make a cute couple.

03:00.779 --> 03:04.615
Isn't there a rule about
lunch ladies dating students?

03:04.616 --> 03:06.851
Why are you being so difficult,
Valerie? Break up with Justin,

03:06.852 --> 03:08.352
and let me set
the two of you up again.

03:08.353 --> 03:09.487
Harvey and I do it
all the time.

03:09.488 --> 03:11.456
It's how we keep
our relationship fresh.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.790
Salem...

03:12.791 --> 03:14.192
this hair-growth tonic
you ordered

03:14.193 --> 03:16.794
is actually
cornbread batter.

03:16.795 --> 03:18.630
They wouldn't sell it
if it didn't work.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.865
Keep stirring.

03:20.866 --> 03:21.966
Well, I'm
off to France

03:21.967 --> 03:23.635
to find the perfect
Valentine's Day dress,

03:23.636 --> 03:25.703
and...maybe kill an hour
at a museum.

03:25.704 --> 03:26.705
( magic tinkles )

03:28.474 --> 03:30.575
Oh, no. Cousin Marigold
and her kids are coming by

03:30.576 --> 03:32.544
to discuss
the family secret.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.412
Better hurry before
Paris closes.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.780
I'd stay, but
I don't like them.

03:36.781 --> 03:37.948
Oh, come on.

03:37.949 --> 03:40.218
You guys can't leave me alone
with Cousin Marigold.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.821
She's like a repressed memory
waiting to happen.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.155
There. A couple
of hours,

03:44.156 --> 03:46.157
and you can call me
Crystal Gayle.

03:46.158 --> 03:47.658
( chuckles )

03:47.659 --> 03:49.194
No, I don't need
a phone number, operator.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.829
I was just wondering,
are you seeing anyone?

03:51.830 --> 03:53.631
Hello?
( <i>dial tone buzzing</i> )

03:53.632 --> 03:55.066
( thunder crashes )

03:57.102 --> 03:58.669
Sabrina.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.771
Mwah, mwah.

04:00.772 --> 04:02.440
Oh. You look fabulous.

04:02.441 --> 04:05.410
But then against this shabby
wallpaper, who wouldn't?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.479
This is
my daughter, Ally.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.114
She's never been to the, uh--
Ahem. To the Mortal Realm.

04:10.115 --> 04:11.149
Hi, Ally.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.383
You're right.

04:12.384 --> 04:14.786
A whole lot of nothing.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.788
( laughing )

04:16.789 --> 04:20.058
Oh, honey, stop turning
the towels into taffy.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.993
You remember
Amanda?

04:23.428 --> 04:24.763
How could
I forget?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.364
Keep those fingers up
where I can see 'em.

04:26.365 --> 04:29.167
I love it when you can see
fear in their eyes.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.134
( both giggling )

04:31.704 --> 04:33.204
They have so much
energy when

04:33.205 --> 04:34.472
they come to
the Mortal Realm.

04:34.473 --> 04:36.207
You know, I would have
left them with a nanny,

04:36.208 --> 04:38.042
but they won't tell me
what they did with her,

04:38.043 --> 04:40.177
and...they're
at that age.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.814
Somewhere between birth
and 25-to-life?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.582
( crashing, rumbling )

04:44.583 --> 04:45.884
What happened?

04:45.885 --> 04:48.219
Mortal plumbing
can be so confusing.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.121
And fun.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.563
Hey, that's
my sweater.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.398
Oops.

05:00.399 --> 05:02.767
Oh-ho. Come here.

05:02.768 --> 05:05.336
You'd be a good match
for my son, Robby.

05:05.337 --> 05:08.172
He's well on his way to being
a juvenile delinquent too.

05:08.173 --> 05:09.406
I didn't know
you have kids.

05:09.407 --> 05:10.608
Three.
Since the divorce,

05:10.609 --> 05:12.677
sometimes I bring Robby
on calls with me.

05:12.678 --> 05:15.412
He's out front playing
right now.

05:15.413 --> 05:17.081
You're well-insured, right?

05:17.082 --> 05:19.283
Last one to zap him into
a snowman is a rotten egg.

05:19.284 --> 05:20.317
( laughs )

05:20.318 --> 05:21.986
New game. All the kids
are playing it.

05:21.987 --> 05:23.221
Gotta go.

05:30.996 --> 05:32.630
( humming )

05:37.069 --> 05:38.436
Oh!
( laughs )

05:40.339 --> 05:41.906
Thought that
was pretty funny, huh?

05:41.907 --> 05:44.208
It's not <i>Candide,</i>
but yes.

05:44.209 --> 05:46.010
It would go a lot easier
if you'd give me a hand.

05:46.011 --> 05:47.011
Oh. Ha!

05:48.280 --> 05:50.514
Oh. You weren't kidding.

05:50.515 --> 05:52.617
No. No, I don't do tools.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.119
Come on. It's, uh--

05:54.120 --> 05:56.321
It'll be something you can
tell your grandchildren.

05:56.322 --> 06:00.057
Just hold the wrench here while
I try and turn the water off.

06:00.058 --> 06:01.593
( sighs )

06:04.964 --> 06:06.798
Like this?
Yeah.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.567
But, uh, you know,
pull it towards you.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.770
Oh! Agh!

06:11.771 --> 06:14.005
( laughing ):
Now, that was funny, huh?

06:14.006 --> 06:15.372
But not as funny as this.

06:19.578 --> 06:21.011
Or, um...

06:21.012 --> 06:22.579
this.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.882
( screams )

06:24.883 --> 06:26.050
( gasps )

06:26.051 --> 06:27.718
Or this!

06:27.719 --> 06:28.753
Or this.

06:28.754 --> 06:30.020
( dueling fiddle music playing )

06:30.021 --> 06:31.088
Oh! Or this!

06:31.089 --> 06:32.623
Or this!

06:32.624 --> 06:33.625
( gasps )

06:33.626 --> 06:35.460
Or...this!
What are you doing?

06:35.461 --> 06:36.694
( shrieks )
That's funny.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.129
That's funny.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.331
Whoa!
( gasping )

06:42.234 --> 06:44.768
ALLY:
Please, Sabrina. Let me
turn him into a salamander.

06:44.769 --> 06:46.970
No. Not until you're old enough
to use vindictive magic

06:46.971 --> 06:48.039
responsibly.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.276
Okay, but not a very big
salamander.

06:52.277 --> 06:53.812
( giggling )

06:55.147 --> 06:57.148
Oh, the bathroom's
all fixed.

06:57.149 --> 06:59.650
Just, uh, don't use
the toilet, ever.

06:59.651 --> 07:01.152
Girls, you're not
gonna believe this,

07:01.153 --> 07:03.888
but your mother actually
did manual labor.

07:03.889 --> 07:06.090
No.
She ain't half bad.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.993
Hold still. You've got
a little schmutz right there.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.327
What's the matter with Mom?

07:10.328 --> 07:12.564
She's acting all...nice.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.966
Better. She's acting like
she likes him. This is perfect.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.167
I've found my couple.

07:16.168 --> 07:18.369
Well...thanks for
dropping by.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.005
That was very invigorating.

07:21.006 --> 07:22.907
Well, any time you want
to be invigored again,

07:22.908 --> 07:24.976
you...let me know.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.545
Bye.

07:27.546 --> 07:29.080
Dad.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.448
Right.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.950
Heh. He's so small,
I'm always losing him.

07:32.951 --> 07:34.485
Come here,
you.

07:34.486 --> 07:35.819
Oh. Ha.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.494
Where's the water?
I need to rinse.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.629
The tingle is now a burn.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.598
( whimpering )

07:52.838 --> 07:55.339
Marigold, how could you
let Emil walk out like that?

07:55.340 --> 07:58.810
He's cute, he's single,
and you're my last hope.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.678
Me and Emil?

08:00.679 --> 08:02.480
Oh, please, Sabrina.

08:02.481 --> 08:05.783
Eh-- The man makes a living
pulling hair out of drains.

08:05.784 --> 08:08.219
He's got a truck with
his picture on the side of it.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.187
Trust me, it would never work.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.955
Besides, I'm never gonna
see him again.

08:13.024 --> 08:14.792
Fate calling.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.262
I could have sworn I had this
with me when I left.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.897
Oh. Well, you didn't.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.098
But you know,
now that you're back,

08:21.099 --> 08:22.633
you can go ask Marigold out.

08:22.634 --> 08:24.669
Uh, you obviously like her.
( scoffs )

08:24.670 --> 08:26.437
Don't get me wrong.
Your cousin's great,

08:26.438 --> 08:29.407
but there's no way that a rich,
classy woman like her

08:29.408 --> 08:32.042
is going out with a non-rich,
classy guy like me.

08:33.244 --> 08:35.546
But you already had
a splash fight.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.450
Wait. W-- What are
you doing tomorrow?

08:39.451 --> 08:42.486
That's perfect, because Marigold
isn't doing anything either.

08:42.486 --> 08:44.054
Sabrina.
Oh, no, it's no trouble at all.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.123
There's nothing I like to do
more on Valentine's Day

08:46.124 --> 08:47.524
than spend it
cooking a gourmet meal

08:47.525 --> 08:50.093
for our distant relatives and
the people who fix our house.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.863
Well, if you don't have
any other plans--

08:51.864 --> 08:53.130
Remember you said
you'd take us to--

08:53.131 --> 08:55.232
Actually, I'm
completely free.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.101
Great, then we'll see you
tomorrow around 7, okay?

08:57.102 --> 08:58.302
Heh.
All right. That's good.

08:58.303 --> 08:59.871
( giggles )

08:59.872 --> 09:02.506
Jeez. Throw yourself at him,
why don't you?

09:02.507 --> 09:04.642
Sabrina, when we go
to Le Petit Chien,

09:04.643 --> 09:06.210
are you gonna want
an appetizer?

09:06.211 --> 09:08.779
'Cause if you do, I'm gonna need
to shovel a few more driveways.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.014
Oh, Harvey,
I can't go.

09:10.015 --> 09:11.482
I promised my cousin
I'd watch her kids

09:11.483 --> 09:12.650
while she goes on
a date.

09:12.651 --> 09:14.018
I'm helping two people
fall in love

09:14.019 --> 09:15.519
and I'm avoiding
hard time.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.987
I'm really,
really sorry.

09:16.988 --> 09:18.722
I know you wouldn't break
a Valentine's date

09:18.723 --> 09:20.991
if it wasn't important.

09:20.992 --> 09:23.727
Maybe I could go
with my mom.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.431
Okay, Sabrina,
I'm leaving.

09:27.432 --> 09:28.733
Sabrina, I'm
going now.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.101
( gasps )
( gasps )

09:30.102 --> 09:32.503
This is an authentic
Paris original,

09:32.504 --> 09:34.738
so you'd better take off
that knockoff.

09:34.739 --> 09:37.474
I'm not changing.
You change your dress.

09:37.475 --> 09:39.643
It's not like you guys are going
to the same restaurant.

09:39.644 --> 09:41.011
Sabrina makes
a point.

09:41.012 --> 09:43.781
No one you date could afford
Le Petit Chien.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.682
Oh. That's where Carlton
is taking me.

09:45.683 --> 09:47.184
You're such a copycat.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.320
( gasps )

09:49.321 --> 09:50.754
Am not. See?

09:50.755 --> 09:51.755
( gasps )

09:51.756 --> 09:53.090
Ah.
Oh!

09:53.091 --> 09:55.259
Ugh!
Ooh!

09:55.260 --> 09:56.527
Oh!

09:56.528 --> 09:58.262
Ah.

09:58.263 --> 10:00.198
You know, there's
no salad bar there.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.901
Oh, Sabrina, I am
so nervous.

10:03.902 --> 10:06.136
I've never been on a date
with a mortal.

10:06.137 --> 10:09.006
Genies, Martians,
enchanted trees,

10:09.007 --> 10:10.507
but never a mortal.

10:10.508 --> 10:12.877
All you have to do is
be honest and be yourself.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.712
I'll never remember
all that.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.615
Relax. You and Emil
are gonna do great.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.249
Not if we have anything
to do with it.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.585
Fingers ready?

10:22.721 --> 10:24.888
Plunger boy's going down.

10:24.889 --> 10:26.791
Way down.

10:32.797 --> 10:34.699
( sighs )

10:34.700 --> 10:37.035
Tsk. Willard's parking
the car.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.736
Carlton's parking
his Porsche.

10:38.737 --> 10:41.238
He's such a refreshing
change from <i>Willard.</i>

10:42.741 --> 10:44.408
Unbelievable.

10:44.409 --> 10:45.509
Willard, what
happened?

10:47.379 --> 10:49.113
( sighing):
Some idiot
in a Porsche

10:49.114 --> 10:51.448
tried to run me down
in the parking lot.

10:51.449 --> 10:54.252
Sorry. I had to wait
for this old geezer.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.353
Geezer?

10:55.354 --> 10:56.687
That's him.

10:56.688 --> 10:58.422
Carlton, this is
my sister, Zelda.

10:58.423 --> 11:00.624
And this is her geezer--
I mean, boyfriend

11:00.625 --> 11:01.659
--Willard.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.993
Well, uh, nice to
meet you, Zelly.

11:02.994 --> 11:05.263
And I had no idea that
this old sack belonged to you.

11:06.398 --> 11:08.032
Hey. No hard feelings,
huh, Wilbur?

11:08.033 --> 11:10.000
It's Willard.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.769
Course it is.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.939
You should have seen
the look on your face. Whoo.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.375
Table for four?
Uh, no. No, I--

11:18.376 --> 11:20.978
No, no, no, no. The more
the merrier, huh?

11:20.979 --> 11:22.146
Lead on, Willie.

11:22.147 --> 11:23.747
Willard.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.017
Ooh, your poor sister.

11:27.018 --> 11:29.586
Can you say loser?

11:29.587 --> 11:30.821
She has low self-esteem.

11:30.822 --> 11:32.022
Duh.

11:32.023 --> 11:35.793
Where did she get
that arrogant blowhard?

11:35.794 --> 11:38.329
She has low
self-esteem.

11:40.398 --> 11:43.033
Mr. Andronini,
look at you all clean.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.802
Somebody owns
an iron.
( chuckles )

11:46.504 --> 11:47.671
Run!

11:49.374 --> 11:51.008
Oh. I hate when people

11:51.009 --> 11:53.177
drop things
out of airplanes.

11:54.946 --> 11:57.248
And, I'll have
the 14-ounce sirloin.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.451
And I'll have
the 16-ounce sirloin.

12:00.452 --> 12:03.020
You didn't let me
finish.

12:03.021 --> 12:04.088
To start.

12:04.089 --> 12:06.290
Now, tell me about
your hams.

12:06.291 --> 12:09.093
Tonight's entrée
is baked chicken.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.298
I think it's a little
undercooked.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.734
Now I've got to find
a new entrée...

12:17.735 --> 12:19.703
and a coop.

12:19.704 --> 12:20.638
Sabrina, you gotta help me.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.106
I left the formula on too long.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.875
Sabrina, you've got
to help me.

12:24.876 --> 12:26.310
Back of the line, sister.

12:26.311 --> 12:28.713
I asked him about his hobbies,

12:28.714 --> 12:30.080
and he started babbling on

12:30.081 --> 12:33.717
about pitching and catching,
and-- And men in red socks.

12:33.718 --> 12:35.519
Oh, he's talking about
baseball. It's a sport.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.720
Mortal men love it.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.823
Baseball. Got it.

12:41.326 --> 12:42.593
Come with me.

12:42.594 --> 12:44.261
Wait. Wait. You can't
just walk in there

12:44.262 --> 12:46.030
with a professional
baseball player.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.666
Well, can I shrink him down
and put him in my pocket?

12:48.667 --> 12:49.901
Just be honest.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.903
Tell Emil you don't know
anything about baseball.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.771
Guys love explaining
stuff like that.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.206
It's the only downside.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.707
E-excuse me. Did I
get hit in the head

12:56.708 --> 12:58.242
with a foul ball
or something?

12:58.243 --> 12:59.810
Yeah. Enjoy the buzz.

12:59.811 --> 13:01.078
( knocking on door )
Oh.

13:01.079 --> 13:03.447
Go. Here.
Hold this.
( clucks )

13:04.550 --> 13:06.284
You know,
baseball's a game

13:06.285 --> 13:09.453
that combines physical prowess
with mental discipline.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.288
Kill the chicken.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.359
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.695
Sabrina, I'm putting
my foot down.

13:17.696 --> 13:18.896
You're my girlfriend,

13:18.897 --> 13:21.331
and I demand you be with me
on Valentine's Day.

13:21.332 --> 13:23.034
Your mom decided to
go out with your dad?

13:23.035 --> 13:24.367
I'll help you babysit.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.503
That's sweet, Harvey,
but I--

13:25.504 --> 13:27.204
MARIGOLD:
Think it's a wonderful idea.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.539
Marigold. Uh--

13:28.540 --> 13:30.774
But the girls are,
you know...

13:30.775 --> 13:32.510
Oh, don't worry.
They'll be little angels

13:32.511 --> 13:34.344
if I ask them to be.

13:34.345 --> 13:36.246
How come you never
asked them before?

13:37.916 --> 13:39.883
I'm warning you. He better be
just as cute and sweet

13:39.884 --> 13:41.352
when I get back,
or I'll give you a wart

13:41.353 --> 13:43.153
you'll have to push around
in a wheelbarrow.

13:43.154 --> 13:45.689
Watch the blouse.
It's silk.

13:49.794 --> 13:52.430
I'll zap in
a Porta Potti later.

13:52.431 --> 13:56.000
No. There is no way that
<i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>

13:56.001 --> 13:58.368
is on the 100 best movies list.

13:58.369 --> 14:00.804
And I have just about had it
with your know-it-all attitude.

14:00.805 --> 14:03.740
Willard, no. Brute force
never solved anything.

14:03.741 --> 14:04.908
Carlton.
His right knee is bad.

14:04.909 --> 14:06.209
One kick and he's down.

14:06.210 --> 14:08.245
So, Waldo, you gonna
do anything about it,

14:08.246 --> 14:09.846
or are you just gonna
whine about it?

14:09.847 --> 14:11.982
Well, normally, I would
just whine about it,

14:11.983 --> 14:15.485
but you have have
made me really mad.

14:20.525 --> 14:22.225
Agh!

14:23.728 --> 14:26.964
Ooh.
So shall we split
the crème brûlée sampler?

14:28.733 --> 14:30.066
( laughs )

14:30.067 --> 14:32.436
I can't believe I didn't bring
any pictures of my boys.

14:32.437 --> 14:33.837
Oh, they're great.

14:33.838 --> 14:36.874
I mean, they're a handful,
but I wouldn't trade 'em.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.142
I'd sell 'em.

14:42.981 --> 14:45.249
Absolutely delightful.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.151
The couch has
got to go.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.318
What's in your glass?

14:48.319 --> 14:49.687
Oh. Cork.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.421
And it has to go.

14:51.422 --> 14:53.724
Let me fish it out
for you.

14:53.725 --> 14:55.893
Oh. Thank you.

14:55.894 --> 14:59.563
No one is ever gonna mistake me
for Pierre Salinger again.

14:59.564 --> 15:01.832
You know, you are starting
to get a little thin on top.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.634
( sobbing )

15:03.635 --> 15:05.435
Is dessert
almost ready?

15:05.436 --> 15:07.671
I just took the pie
out of the oven. Ten minutes?

15:07.672 --> 15:08.672
( rumbling )

15:08.673 --> 15:10.007
Hold this!

15:10.008 --> 15:11.275
Harvey!

15:13.778 --> 15:15.212
( coughs )
Where's Harvey?

15:15.213 --> 15:17.681
Right here. Just as cute
and sweet as when you left him.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.351
Harvey!

15:20.352 --> 15:22.419
We changed his name
to Cuddles.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.521
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

15:24.522 --> 15:26.523
( barking )

15:28.993 --> 15:30.527
Dessert's coming
right out.

15:32.030 --> 15:33.764
SALEM:
Oh, no! Dog!

15:33.765 --> 15:35.766
( glass shattering )
PLAYER: Oh, no, my pie!

15:37.202 --> 15:38.402
( barking )

15:41.073 --> 15:43.406
( Salem snarling )

15:51.749 --> 15:53.583
There. Oh.

15:53.584 --> 15:55.385
Fixed that wobble. Ha.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.323
Change him back!

15:59.324 --> 16:00.424
( giggling )

16:00.425 --> 16:01.992
Time to put

16:01.993 --> 16:03.593
Operation: Get
This Loser Plumber

16:03.594 --> 16:04.895
Out Of Our Lives
into action.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.966
This wine is making me
feel so warm.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.736
Agh! Fire!
Fire! Oh, my God, fire!

16:12.737 --> 16:15.306
Oh, my God, my pants!
Fire. Oh. Yeah.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.908
Good, good, good. Here.

16:17.909 --> 16:20.277
Hey. I got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

16:20.278 --> 16:21.945
Thanks.

16:21.946 --> 16:24.114
Where did that
watering can come from?

16:24.115 --> 16:25.815
Uh-- Uh, this?

16:25.816 --> 16:27.751
Oh, um...

16:27.752 --> 16:29.486
I'll be right back.

16:29.487 --> 16:32.389
Hey, I'm-- I'm too young
to be a chew toy.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.457
( barking )

16:33.458 --> 16:35.326
Harvey, heel!

16:35.327 --> 16:38.496
Sabrina, what do I say
to Emil? His chair just--

16:38.497 --> 16:41.198
Marigold, whatever it is, just
be yourself and be honest.

16:41.199 --> 16:42.633
( dog barking )
Bad dog, Harvey!

16:49.207 --> 16:50.607
Where's Emil?

16:50.608 --> 16:52.409
Hair-clog emergency
somewhere?

16:52.410 --> 16:54.278
You two, kitchen, now.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.546
And there's a puddle on the
mud porch with your names on it.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.184
Where's Emil?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.618
Help.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.354
Help.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.287
( gasps )

17:04.288 --> 17:05.589
Help.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.557
Well...um,

17:07.558 --> 17:09.392
let's get him out and
hope he didn't notice.

17:13.364 --> 17:15.065
So Emil, you were saying?

17:16.934 --> 17:18.501
Who-- Who are
you people?

17:18.502 --> 17:19.536
Wait, I can explain.

17:19.537 --> 17:21.538
You can? I mean,
of course she can.

17:21.539 --> 17:23.373
Emil, I have to be
honest with you.

17:23.374 --> 17:24.675
I'm a witch.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.877
Am I the only one who
thinks the salmon mousse

17:27.878 --> 17:29.113
has gone
a little bad?

17:29.114 --> 17:30.781
Th-th-- Think I'll go now.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.354
Now...

17:37.355 --> 17:39.023
who wants decaf?

17:40.458 --> 17:42.759
So, where'd you learn
to fight like that?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.995
Well, when you grow up
playing the zither

17:44.996 --> 17:46.162
and loving Doris Day,

17:46.163 --> 17:48.465
you get in your share
of scrapes.

17:48.466 --> 17:50.534
You're a Doris Day fan?

17:50.535 --> 17:51.802
Me too.

17:51.803 --> 17:54.905
No kidding? Huh.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.139
Marigold, you have to
go after Emil.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.675
If he tells anyone
you're a witch,

17:57.676 --> 18:00.210
you'll all be thrown out of the
Other Realm and lose your magic.

18:00.211 --> 18:01.812
You'll be mortal, and
you'll have to live...

18:01.813 --> 18:04.280
here.
Come on, woman, move.

18:04.281 --> 18:06.784
I think he made it clear
he doesn't want to see me again.

18:06.785 --> 18:08.385
Fine. I'll go.

18:08.386 --> 18:10.420
I'm sure he hasn't had a chance
to tell anyone yet.

18:16.761 --> 18:18.528
Unless he has
a car phone.

18:20.865 --> 18:22.199
Couple of days
in the slammer

18:22.200 --> 18:24.067
might teach Carlton to
fight a little better.

18:24.068 --> 18:25.836
Oh, we can't just
leave them here, Hilda.

18:25.837 --> 18:28.806
It's partially our fault for
pitting them against each other.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.041
Really? I slept
the whole time?

18:31.042 --> 18:32.743
It may be time to
go back to naps.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.845
Yeah, but I'm wide awake
now, and I feel--

18:34.846 --> 18:35.845
Go get it!

18:37.782 --> 18:39.182
( sighs )

18:39.183 --> 18:41.852
Marigold, I'm really sorry
about you losing your magic.

18:41.853 --> 18:44.888
I feel responsible. I just
didn't want to pick up trash.

18:44.889 --> 18:46.790
Oh, don't blame
yourself, Sabrina.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.492
I'm sure I can
learn to cope.

18:51.062 --> 18:52.762
Here. You just
flip the switch.

18:53.864 --> 18:57.367
Oh. Dear Lord,
what have I done?

18:57.368 --> 18:58.735
( knocking on door )

18:58.736 --> 19:01.371
Oh. Why did I have to
turn him into a retriever?

19:01.372 --> 19:02.639
Harvey.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.042
Mr. Andronini?

19:06.043 --> 19:07.076
Emil.
( clears throat )

19:07.077 --> 19:08.612
You came back.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.780
I've been driving around
the last hour thinking.

19:10.781 --> 19:12.983
And talking.
Yeah. To my brother.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.886
He, uh, thinks
I'm crazy.

19:15.887 --> 19:17.087
I am.

19:17.088 --> 19:18.822
About you.

19:18.823 --> 19:20.457
Wow.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.825
And he's met my children.

19:21.826 --> 19:24.328
I don't understand
what happened tonight...

19:24.329 --> 19:27.364
but for some
strange reason,

19:27.365 --> 19:29.433
I know I want to
keep seeing you.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.768
I'm not going anywhere.

19:31.769 --> 19:32.903
Oh.

19:32.904 --> 19:34.805
( <i>romantic theme playing</i> )

19:34.806 --> 19:37.708
Oh, I-- I just-- I just want
to clarify one thing.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.243
Do you have
magical powers?

19:40.244 --> 19:42.479
I can honestly say
I don't.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.814
( <i>romantic theme playing</i> )

19:45.883 --> 19:47.684
Yes! I did it!

19:47.685 --> 19:49.686
I'm not even
gonna ask.

19:49.687 --> 19:51.354
Look. I did it.

19:51.355 --> 19:52.723
Marigold and Emil
are in love.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.858
Oh, bully
for them.

19:54.859 --> 19:56.292
Oh, see, Sabrina?

19:56.293 --> 19:57.461
That wasn't so hard.

20:01.699 --> 20:03.633
Throw it again.
Throw it again.

20:03.634 --> 20:05.435
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

20:05.436 --> 20:06.436
( grunting )

20:13.044 --> 20:14.612
You really don't mind
losing your magic?

20:14.613 --> 20:17.781
All I can say is I have had
magic for hundreds of years,

20:17.782 --> 20:19.416
and I have never
really been happy.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.817
And now I'm happy.

20:20.818 --> 20:22.752
What's the trick
to this?

20:25.490 --> 20:27.390
Why do they have to
make it so complicated?

20:27.391 --> 20:28.759
Oh, I almost forgot.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.232
A poorly-cut
valentine?

20:35.233 --> 20:37.467
No. It's your clue
to the family secret.

20:37.468 --> 20:40.403
Hey. You ever tried
to use scissors?

20:40.404 --> 20:41.704
Barbaric.

20:44.842 --> 20:47.210
Whoa. Tornado
in the bathroom?

20:47.211 --> 20:49.079
We never had to get dressed
the mortal way before.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.014
Buttons are
hard.

20:51.015 --> 20:54.118
Knock, knock. Four hungry men
reporting for duty.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.986
This is, uh, Darryl...

20:55.987 --> 20:57.321
and Angelo.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.556
And, uh, you met Robby.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.025
Hi, boys.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.859
I'm Marigold.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.496
And these are my daughters,
Amanda and Ally.

21:05.497 --> 21:07.764
Nice shirt. Button it
with your feet?

21:07.765 --> 21:08.932
No. My fist.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.668
( croaks )
( screams )

21:11.669 --> 21:12.770
Oh.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.671
Kids, come on. Hey.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.740
Can we act like a family here?

21:16.741 --> 21:18.976
Quit saying that.
We're not a family.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.877
Hey. Now, Robby...

21:20.878 --> 21:21.945
Guys.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.113
Sounds like
a real family to me.

21:23.114 --> 21:24.047
Ha.
( groans )
