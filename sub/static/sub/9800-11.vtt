00:01.300 --> 00:04.900
<B>ALL CHOKED UP!<B>

00:05.300 --> 00:09.800
<i>www.podnapisi.net</i>

00:19.881 --> 00:20.931
Well, well.

00:21.238 --> 00:24.439
Trying to bury a secret,
Miss zookeeper?

00:24.607 --> 00:26.907
Pity for you, penguins never sleep.

00:32.549 --> 00:34.114
Penguins never sleep!

00:35.205 --> 00:36.200
Look alive.

00:36.588 --> 00:38.956
I've got my freak on for recon.

00:45.960 --> 00:46.976
Whistling.

00:47.336 --> 00:48.509
Awfully cheery

00:48.634 --> 00:51.837
for someone pushing
a suspiciously human-shaped sack,

00:51.962 --> 00:53.312
wouldn't you say?

00:53.682 --> 00:54.675
I don't know.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.454
Sometimes a good whistle makes me feel
like a pretty little butterfly.

01:00.536 --> 01:02.139
Damn the sweet talk, Private.

01:02.264 --> 01:05.038
You know Rico
has gooey love mush sensitivity.

01:09.377 --> 01:11.942
Looks like
she's burying the evidence,

01:13.096 --> 01:15.653
above ground, standing up

01:15.821 --> 01:17.739
in the busiest crossroads
of the zoo.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.354
Putting her gruesome handiwork
on display?

01:22.479 --> 01:24.078
How sick is this woman?

01:25.712 --> 01:27.331
Please, no zombie.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.377
No.
It's worse.

01:36.136 --> 01:39.801
Hello, Mr. Robot guide.
Tell me where to find the otters.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.138
Otters that away, little ranger.

01:43.825 --> 01:45.056
Works like a dream.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.042
Good-bye,
annoying tour group questions.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.812
It's too horrible for words,

01:51.107 --> 01:53.855
except these ones,
the words I'm saying right now.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.734
These are fine.
But anything else, no go.

01:57.053 --> 01:59.514
But, Skipper,
it doesn't look that horrible.

01:59.639 --> 02:01.336
I like that fearless attitude,

02:01.461 --> 02:04.522
but only a fool could fail
to see the danger

02:04.701 --> 02:06.257
in this metallic invader.

02:06.382 --> 02:08.161
Step to the sides, gentlemen.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.007
Now can you not see
that I am coming through?

02:12.120 --> 02:13.531
Metal wiseman,

02:13.857 --> 02:17.826
show me who is the smartest
of all creatures.

02:19.477 --> 02:20.631
That is right!

02:21.313 --> 02:22.035
Me.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.457
Make the shiny man do magic again.

02:26.263 --> 02:30.194
Now show me
who has the most attractive bottom.

02:33.103 --> 02:34.186
Amazing.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.271
How does it know?

02:36.439 --> 02:38.884
Take a look at our future, boys.

02:39.009 --> 02:41.868
Phase two, robot animals.

02:42.403 --> 02:45.530
It's a classic cost-cutting maneuver:
replacement and elimination.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.315
But there's...

02:47.440 --> 02:49.408
four things they didn't count on.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.328
The war on robots starts...

02:57.243 --> 02:58.091
now!

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074

03:09.991 --> 03:11.195
Come on, Rico.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.945
These prissy party favors
won't take down that pile

03:14.070 --> 03:15.558
of evil robot steel.

03:22.147 --> 03:23.115
What now?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.166
That is just disturbing.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.825
Dynamite.
The classic time bomb bundle

03:33.993 --> 03:35.869
with the L.E.D. Countdown delay,

03:36.037 --> 03:37.648
maximum explodability

03:37.773 --> 03:39.914
matched
with maximum getaway-ability.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.500
You're a mad genius.

03:42.921 --> 03:46.921
That robo zoo guide goes "sayonara"
in a half an hour:

03:49.299 --> 03:50.591
high noon.

03:51.455 --> 03:52.927
Alice incoming!

04:14.531 --> 04:16.324
Time to take your medicine.

04:22.164 --> 04:24.556
That should keep your lunch
down where it belongs.

04:26.855 --> 04:29.721
That dame is a riddle
wrapped in mystery

04:29.846 --> 04:31.671
and dunked in nasty sauce.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.881
Mission time.

04:33.827 --> 04:35.633
Re-regurgitate that time bomb.

04:42.725 --> 04:43.766
You all right?

04:59.017 --> 05:01.293
Gack attack.
Anti-vomiting syrup.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.844
We'll take the "ew" out of "spew."

05:04.501 --> 05:05.411
Appetizing.

05:05.579 --> 05:08.790
Sorry. Looks like you're all plugged up
till the medicine wears off.

05:11.627 --> 05:14.170
23 minutes, 17 seconds
from detonation, Skipper.

05:14.338 --> 05:16.894
So that's their game,
blowing us up one by one

05:17.019 --> 05:19.400
with un-regurgitatble gut bombs.

05:19.636 --> 05:20.635
Horrified

05:20.760 --> 05:22.139
yet impressed.

05:23.526 --> 05:26.681
It's so obvious,
I should've seen it coming.

05:27.151 --> 05:29.684
I'm sorry, Rico.
I blame myself.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.188
Not Rico. Not anybody.

05:33.848 --> 05:36.107
- Status report.
- 22 minutes, 46 seconds.

05:36.275 --> 05:39.280
Then we've got
22 minutes and 45 seconds

05:39.405 --> 05:41.153
to get that bomb
out of our buddy's belly.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.139
Rico, my friend,

05:43.264 --> 05:45.902
we are going to teach you
to spew again!

05:48.386 --> 05:51.038
Try to keep it in the bag, please.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.809
Shields up.

06:07.137 --> 06:08.098
Don't worry.

06:08.223 --> 06:11.015
There's more than one way
to make a penguin puke his guts out.

06:11.183 --> 06:13.019
- Really? How many...
- 17.

06:13.144 --> 06:16.395
Just don't ever ask
to see number 12.

06:17.621 --> 06:20.342
I smuggled this
out of the souvenir shop.

06:20.821 --> 06:22.359
A nature documentary?

06:22.732 --> 06:24.027
Wait for it.

06:26.827 --> 06:28.448
This is Antarctica,

06:28.842 --> 06:31.276
icy home to the playful penguin.

06:31.969 --> 06:33.953
That looks like uncle Nigel.

06:34.329 --> 06:37.449
Become prey
for the insatiable blood-thirst

06:37.574 --> 06:39.000
of this leopard seal.

06:39.838 --> 06:41.627
That image will haunt me.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.754
It's just a boring documentary.

06:43.922 --> 06:46.607
But you can't eat just one,
Mr. Seal.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.177
Well, Rico,

06:50.466 --> 06:51.814
Sorry it's come to this,

06:51.939 --> 06:55.015
but I had Kowalski whip up
a little concoction called

06:55.604 --> 06:56.913
number 12.

06:57.038 --> 06:59.556
Two scoops of squirrel lint,
a dash of baboon spit,

06:59.681 --> 07:01.444
used kitty litter,
one hippo toenail,

07:01.569 --> 07:03.869
and anything we could find
in the monkey cages.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.133
Bottoms up.

07:27.338 --> 07:28.963
4 minutes and 26 seconds left.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.548
Kowalski, ideas?

07:30.942 --> 07:32.675
That bomb is not coming out.

07:33.128 --> 07:36.053
We could send a man inside
to defuse it if we were yay tall.

07:36.221 --> 07:38.180
How close are we
to shrink ray technology?

07:38.787 --> 07:39.723
700 years.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.268
Curse you, shrink ray!

07:43.341 --> 07:44.520
Make that 712.

07:46.128 --> 07:50.053
Who is burping up
the stinking fog of lint

07:50.178 --> 07:53.056
and spit and unspeakable things

07:53.181 --> 07:54.820
from a kitten and...

07:56.151 --> 07:59.283
I don't even want to know
what that fart was...

07:59.942 --> 08:01.827
It smells like the circus.

08:04.873 --> 08:06.707
Am I going to the circus too?

08:08.331 --> 08:11.108
Why is the circus so dark and slimy?

08:12.303 --> 08:14.506
There's popcorn down here.
Hurray!

08:15.260 --> 08:18.032
- Bird's gone carnivore.
- Quick. We must flee.

08:18.157 --> 08:20.512
Maurice, distract them
by being eaten.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.679
Tiny lemur,

08:21.849 --> 08:24.542
listen very carefully to Kowalski.

08:25.137 --> 08:27.221
He's going to talk you through this.

08:30.150 --> 08:33.857
All right, you need to get
to the bottom of the stomach.

08:34.025 --> 08:35.693
Down the spiral staircase?

08:35.861 --> 08:37.611
Take the elevator.
It's quicker.

08:39.114 --> 08:40.739
Do you see the time bomb?

08:41.340 --> 08:43.241
I see an old squeaky toy.

08:44.299 --> 08:46.912
- I see it! I see the bomb.
- Good.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.908
Now separate the blue and yellow wires
from their sheathing

08:50.033 --> 08:52.725
reverse their polarity,
then splice both into the ground lead,

08:52.850 --> 08:54.866
which should be
a slightly thicker copper filament.

08:54.991 --> 08:56.734
Am I going too fast for you?

08:58.565 --> 09:00.397
Which of the colors is blue?

09:01.134 --> 09:03.260
Is this a blue one?

09:03.428 --> 09:05.180
No, I believe that's a kidney.

09:05.305 --> 09:07.854
Sorry, "amigo".
Looks like game over.

09:08.892 --> 09:10.975
I never thought
it would end this way,

09:11.100 --> 09:13.259
but I want you to know I love you,

09:13.704 --> 09:14.938
you crazy knucklehead.

09:15.106 --> 09:17.796
I also love you

09:17.921 --> 09:21.528
in the same way
expressed previously, dude.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.195
I love you too, Rico.

09:26.116 --> 09:28.111
And I love this popcorn.

09:28.452 --> 09:30.090
It's a little wet, though.

09:32.631 --> 09:34.123
What is that noise?

09:35.419 --> 09:37.879
I know
I'm not good with words, Rico.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.977
And, either are you, really,

09:41.631 --> 09:43.306
but I just want to say

09:44.379 --> 09:46.340
you are my brother.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.262
That's poetry, Skipper.

09:51.265 --> 09:52.516
I don't know about him,

09:52.641 --> 09:55.017
but this mush is making me
want to blow chunks.

09:55.185 --> 09:56.455
Do you mind?

09:58.522 --> 10:01.036
Where raise the sun
lay softly its head,

10:01.161 --> 10:03.659
there will the land whisper, Rico.

10:06.307 --> 10:07.738
Now that's poetry.

10:13.701 --> 10:15.578
I just want to see
a penguin throw up.

10:23.879 --> 10:26.130
- Mort, the bomb.
- Get rid of the bomb!

10:26.298 --> 10:28.626
I've got the bomb. Mort is the best!

10:28.751 --> 10:30.342
I am the winner.
Mort is the...

10:33.263 --> 10:34.179
Little ranger.

10:41.229 --> 10:42.979
We won.
And Rico's still alive!

10:45.650 --> 10:46.880
Come here, boys.

10:49.622 --> 10:53.626
He was the only one
who truly appreciated my bottom.

10:57.383 --> 10:59.512
He's still loving my booty.
