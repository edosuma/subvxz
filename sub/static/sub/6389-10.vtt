01:20.008 --> 01:21.308
Hi!

01:21.342 --> 01:22.943
Hank, I told you!

01:23.011 --> 01:25.256
I know you told me,
but I wanted to see for myself.

01:26.057 --> 01:28.282
You're convalescing
quite nicely...

01:28.317 --> 01:30.785
- quite nicely, indeed.
- Thank you very much.

01:30.819 --> 01:33.654
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some food on the stove.

01:33.689 --> 01:35.223
Oh, you're hungry, are you?

01:35.257 --> 01:38.559
Hank, I'm making myself
something to eat.

01:38.594 --> 01:40.128
Wouldn't you rather
go out to dinner,

01:40.162 --> 01:41.562
you know, blow the stink off?

01:41.597 --> 01:43.164
I mean, not that you ever
really stink,

01:43.198 --> 01:44.699
although sometimes
in the morning with the breath,

01:44.733 --> 01:46.200
but I don't mind that.

01:46.235 --> 01:47.596
I can kiss
right through that shit.

01:47.603 --> 01:49.370
I love it, actually.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.406
Your effluvium has always been
quite refreshing to me...

01:51.440 --> 01:52.907
- Okay!
- Like cucumber lemonade...

01:52.941 --> 01:54.342
or cucumber spa water.

01:54.376 --> 01:56.344
Hank, are these words
for me or for you?

01:56.412 --> 01:58.379
For both of us, Karen.

01:58.414 --> 02:00.415
Wordplay, foreplay--
it's all the same thing.

02:00.449 --> 02:02.583
You know what?
I'm exhausted.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.585
I want to go lie down.
It's just, like--

02:04.620 --> 02:07.855
Oh, oh, is that an invite?

02:07.890 --> 02:09.357
J.K., as the kids say.
J.K.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.925
Come on,
I'll provide the transpo.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.094
I won't even try
to finger you while I drive.

02:13.128 --> 02:14.529
- Oh, please.
- I promise.

02:14.563 --> 02:16.264
I might try to gauge
your heat, though...

02:16.298 --> 02:17.432
over the clothes.

02:17.466 --> 02:19.000
I am not a fucking animal.

02:19.034 --> 02:21.936
You are making it really hard
for me to say no.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.671
Allow me to appeal
to the foodie in you.

02:23.705 --> 02:26.274
It's at a new place.
A pop-up, if you will.

02:26.308 --> 02:27.842
It's all the rage, four stars.

02:27.876 --> 02:29.877
The blogosphere is abuzz.

02:29.912 --> 02:32.513
- That is so mean.
- I know. I know.

02:32.548 --> 02:34.782
You know how much I love
trying new restaurants.

02:34.817 --> 02:36.050
- I do.
- Don't say that shit.

02:36.084 --> 02:37.652
I do know that.
I do know that.

02:37.686 --> 02:39.253
- Karen?
- Hmm?

02:39.288 --> 02:41.622
- Something is burning.
- Oh!

02:41.657 --> 02:44.192
I do believe your sad little
solo dinner is ruined.

02:44.259 --> 02:46.427
- Fire!
- Oh, my!

02:49.498 --> 02:59.472

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:33.242 --> 03:35.910
Okay, so you didn't forget
your wallet.

03:35.944 --> 03:37.178
Nope.

03:37.212 --> 03:38.713
This is a new pop-up
restaurant?

03:38.747 --> 03:40.615
Yep.

03:40.649 --> 03:43.818
So let's get it over with.
I'm fucking starving.

03:43.852 --> 03:45.953
Oh, I see
what you're doing here, Karen.

03:45.988 --> 03:47.822
You're establishing an attitude

03:47.856 --> 03:51.192
to combat the romantic mood
that I've established here.

03:51.226 --> 03:53.327
And you know what?
I'm okay with that.

03:53.362 --> 03:55.263
You know, that actually gives me
something to work with.

03:55.297 --> 03:57.331
In fact, it's the very essence
of drama.

03:57.366 --> 04:00.301
A guy wants something,
something stands in his way.

04:00.335 --> 04:01.736
<i>Little Engine That Could--</i>
same thing.

04:01.770 --> 04:04.672
Oh, my God.
Hank, just shut the fuck up.

04:04.706 --> 04:06.741
Refresh yourself.
<i>Tranya!</i>

04:06.775 --> 04:10.011
Have a drink.
<i>In vino veritas...</i>

04:10.045 --> 04:11.245
or something like that.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.548
In wine, there is truth,
I believe.

04:13.582 --> 04:14.982
Mm-hmm.

04:15.017 --> 04:16.551
In whiskey,
there may be a little more.

04:16.584 --> 04:17.885
In tequila,
there's, like, a lot of truth.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.952
Okay, great.
Where are the Runkles?

04:18.987 --> 04:20.588
Mm.
Oh, those guys?

04:20.622 --> 04:22.290
Yeah, they went out to dinner
on Abbot Kinney--

04:22.324 --> 04:24.692
that little pop-up
I was telling you about.

04:24.726 --> 04:27.695
What?
They got to go there?

04:27.729 --> 04:29.730
Well, you know I wanted
to try that place.

04:29.765 --> 04:31.332
Why didn't you just
take me there?

04:31.366 --> 04:33.868
Because I thought
this would be way more charming.

04:33.902 --> 04:35.870
Dinner at Charlie
and Marcy's house?

04:35.904 --> 04:39.006
Come on, a dinner slaved over
by yours truly...

04:39.041 --> 04:41.208
at an empty Malibu Beach house?

04:41.243 --> 04:43.010
This place is ours for hours.

04:43.045 --> 04:44.745
- Hank.
- Yes.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.347
Look at me.

04:46.381 --> 04:48.349
I am not gonna sleep with you.

04:48.383 --> 04:51.018
- I have no such expectations.
- Bullshit.

04:51.053 --> 04:54.188
What is all this for if it's
not to pry my legs apart?

04:54.222 --> 04:57.291
I wanted to do this for you.
You deserve it.

04:57.326 --> 05:00.528
I mean, ever since I've
come back, I've been adrift.

05:00.562 --> 05:02.597
Obviously Levon rocked my world.

05:02.631 --> 05:03.898
Mm-hmm.

05:03.932 --> 05:05.566
And I've been down some roads

05:05.601 --> 05:07.301
that have led to some
pretty dirty back alleys,

05:07.336 --> 05:09.236
but through it all,
I've kept my eye on the prize.

05:09.271 --> 05:11.372
- Hank.
- Yes.

05:11.406 --> 05:13.107
Aren't you tired?

05:13.141 --> 05:15.476
I mean, don't you just, like,

05:15.510 --> 05:17.244
want to start again
with someone new?

05:17.279 --> 05:20.081
No. God, no.
Is that what you want?

05:20.115 --> 05:22.850
Yeah.
I mean, sometimes. Sure.

05:22.884 --> 05:24.619
Why would I find a new life

05:24.653 --> 05:26.787
when I haven't perfected
the perfectly good old one?

05:26.822 --> 05:29.457
Well, exactly.
Maybe you can't perfect it.

05:29.491 --> 05:31.425
I mean, at a certain point,

05:31.460 --> 05:33.694
it just--
you know, it is what it is.

05:33.729 --> 05:35.029
- And then we die.
- I don't agree.

05:35.063 --> 05:36.664
I do not agree.

05:36.698 --> 05:38.499
See, I've learned a lot
about myself

05:38.533 --> 05:40.234
- during our time in the sun.
- Mm-hmm.

05:40.268 --> 05:43.537
And through it all, I have
only ever wanted one thing--

05:43.572 --> 05:44.939
you.

05:44.973 --> 05:47.642
Maybe wanting is not enough.

05:47.676 --> 05:50.244
- Isn't it, though?
- I don't think so.

05:50.278 --> 05:51.612
I disagree.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.981
Yeah, but it's not a debate.

05:54.016 --> 05:55.483
It's not something you can win.

05:55.517 --> 05:56.717
I'm not trying to win anything.

05:56.752 --> 05:58.552
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

05:58.587 --> 06:00.788
You're--you're always, like,
trying a new angle,

06:00.822 --> 06:02.423
- like this, you know...
- No.

06:02.457 --> 06:04.425
Some huge, grand,
romantic gesture.

06:04.459 --> 06:07.395
What grand, romantic gesture?

06:07.429 --> 06:10.464
What we really need to do
is just look at our history

06:10.499 --> 06:13.601
and realize...
it doesn't work.

06:13.635 --> 06:16.203
I mean, we don't work.

06:16.238 --> 06:17.938
Now, now, Karen,

06:17.973 --> 06:20.041
let's not turn this
into some dry history lesson.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.810
Let's just enjoy
this glorious meal, okay?

06:22.844 --> 06:25.579
Have a bite,
have another sip of wine.

06:25.614 --> 06:28.315
Let's, you know,
savor each other's company.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.317
- Mm-hmm.
-<i> Mangia!</i>

06:30.352 --> 06:32.186
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

06:32.220 --> 06:34.622
- You said that already.
- I did?

06:34.656 --> 06:36.691
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, it's true.

06:41.163 --> 06:43.798
- Hank?
- Hmm?

06:43.832 --> 06:46.100
- This is really good.
- I know, right?

06:46.134 --> 06:47.802
Did you make this by yourself?

06:47.836 --> 06:49.503
Yeah, yeah.

06:49.538 --> 06:50.838
No.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.775
I tried, but I failed miserably.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.371
What I made looked like
sick on a plate,

06:56.378 --> 06:58.045
tasted even worse.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.315
So I went out and I procured
some high-end takeout--

07:01.349 --> 07:03.184
full disclosure.

07:03.218 --> 07:06.520
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay, sweetie.

07:06.555 --> 07:08.055
You see that?

07:08.090 --> 07:10.624
You are charmed by
my failed attempts to charm you.

07:10.659 --> 07:12.560
- Yeah, a little.
- Have more wine.

07:12.594 --> 07:14.228
There's truth in it, you know.

07:14.262 --> 07:17.231
There's someone at the door.

07:21.603 --> 07:22.970
- Hi!
- Hi.

07:23.004 --> 07:25.139
- Not a good time.
- I'm sorry.

07:25.173 --> 07:27.007
I just--I felt bad
about things,

07:27.042 --> 07:29.310
and I, uh--I wanted to see
how you were doing.

07:29.344 --> 07:31.178
- I'm well.
- And how's Karen?

07:31.213 --> 07:33.147
- She's well--
- She's fine.

07:33.181 --> 07:34.749
Oh, hi!

07:34.783 --> 07:37.685
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Oh, God, I had no idea.

07:37.719 --> 07:40.888
- I-I'll be on my way.
- No, please, stay, stay.

07:40.922 --> 07:42.556
Don't be silly.

07:42.591 --> 07:44.091
I mean, you're obviously
in the middle of something.

07:44.126 --> 07:45.693
No, just dinner.

07:45.727 --> 07:47.061
What do you mean
"just dinner"? "Just dinner"?

07:47.095 --> 07:48.395
- Oh.
- Please stay.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.197
We need to get to know
one another.

07:50.232 --> 07:53.534
I mean, our paths are gonna be
crossing here and there, right?

07:53.568 --> 07:55.503
Well, why don't you guys,
you know,

07:55.537 --> 07:58.172
make a date
to meet for coffee next week?

07:58.206 --> 08:00.107
- That sounds like a good idea.
- You want some wine?

08:00.142 --> 08:01.375
- You know, after tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

08:01.409 --> 08:02.777
Yeah, God, I would love
a glass of wine.

08:02.811 --> 08:04.278
Uh-huh, it's kind of good.
Here.

08:04.312 --> 08:08.582
- Thank you, Karen.
- You're welcome, Julia.

08:08.617 --> 08:10.050
Wow.

08:10.085 --> 08:11.852
This is so great.

08:18.927 --> 08:20.628
We were there at the same time.

08:20.662 --> 08:22.863
Well, it stands to reason,
and having a kid with him.

08:22.898 --> 08:24.465
- Holy shit, right?
- Mm.

08:24.499 --> 08:26.734
- This is still so great.
- Yeah.

08:26.768 --> 08:28.602
Could we have
some more wine, please?

08:28.637 --> 08:30.070
Do you have any dessert?

08:30.105 --> 08:32.239
Oh, I'd be happy to, Karen.

08:32.274 --> 08:35.109
- Hi!
- What? What's wrong?

08:35.143 --> 08:37.378
What's not wrong?

08:37.412 --> 08:40.080
And our credit cards
get declined--all of them.

08:40.115 --> 08:42.582
Runks got pissy.
They called the cops.

08:42.616 --> 08:45.286
It was a whole big to-do!

08:45.320 --> 08:47.454
You could've left
the door open for me, you know.

08:47.489 --> 08:49.390
You knew I was coming in.

08:49.424 --> 08:52.359
Just slamming it like that--
that's very rude.

08:52.394 --> 08:54.795
We need to stick
together here, Marcy.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.565
- Hello. Hello.
- Hi.

08:57.599 --> 09:00.868
You invited Julia to your
romantic dinner with Karen?

09:00.902 --> 09:02.469
You dirty dog, you.

09:02.504 --> 09:03.871
I just stopped by unannounced.

09:03.905 --> 09:06.473
- Oh, I see.
- Marcy Runkle.

09:06.508 --> 09:08.075
- Hi.
- Your kid's a doll.

09:08.109 --> 09:10.311
Thank you so much!
Wow!

09:10.345 --> 09:11.912
You have the nicest friends.

09:11.947 --> 09:14.048
Marcy Runkle,
would you like perhaps

09:14.082 --> 09:16.016
to continue
our propositional conversation

09:16.051 --> 09:17.384
in the bedroom maybe?

09:17.419 --> 09:20.187
No, I would like
to seek outside counsel.

09:20.222 --> 09:22.223
Karenina, Karenina.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.325
Now that you're better,
can I ask you a question?

09:24.359 --> 09:26.493
- Anything.
- Okay.

09:26.528 --> 09:28.095
Stu wants to sleep
with me again.

09:28.129 --> 09:31.065
- Of course he does.
- For a million dollars.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.334
What?

09:33.368 --> 09:36.570
He would pay you a million
dollars to sleep with you?

09:36.605 --> 09:37.905
Yes.

09:37.939 --> 09:39.540
Would he pay me
a million dollars

09:39.574 --> 09:41.254
- to sleep with me?
- What the fuck, Karen?

09:41.276 --> 09:43.077
What are you talking about?

09:43.111 --> 09:44.979
- That's disgusting.
- What? It's a lot of money.

09:45.013 --> 09:46.547
Gluten-free
artisanal custard tort.

09:46.581 --> 09:49.116
- Oh, that's lovely.
- Wow!

09:49.150 --> 09:50.751
Is Stu
the big bald producer guy?

09:50.785 --> 09:52.586
Yeah, that's right.

09:52.621 --> 09:55.055
You know, I saw the outline
of his penis through his pants

09:55.090 --> 09:57.224
at the table read the other day,
and it was freakishly big.

09:57.259 --> 09:59.894
Yeah, that's my ex.
Anyway, listen...

09:59.928 --> 10:01.862
he wouldn't be into you, honey,

10:01.897 --> 10:03.764
'cause he's only into tiny,
petite little fuck dolls.

10:03.798 --> 10:05.933
That's my girl--
tiny, little, petite fuck doll.

10:05.967 --> 10:08.535
- Okay, so should I do it?
- No. No.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.137
That's my girl.

10:10.171 --> 10:13.107
- But we are fucking broke!
- I know.

10:13.141 --> 10:16.310
Jesus Christ!
Julia. Julia.

10:16.344 --> 10:19.947
Would you fuck a guy
for a million dollars?

10:19.981 --> 10:22.750
He's got a great big cock,
fills you right up.

10:22.784 --> 10:24.785
Jesus, Marcy!

10:24.819 --> 10:26.854
You know, I have never been
that much of a size queen.

10:26.888 --> 10:29.156
I prefer a pretty penis.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.859
That's right, baby.

10:31.893 --> 10:35.162
I'm sorry, Karen.
It's just--it's very confusing.

10:35.196 --> 10:38.432
And--and you invited her
to join us, so...

10:38.466 --> 10:40.601
It's true--we have
both experienced his penis.

10:40.635 --> 10:42.303
- And it--
- Mm-hmm.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.772
- It is pretty.
- It's okay.

10:44.806 --> 10:46.273
I've seen it.

10:46.308 --> 10:47.675
I tugged on it
a couple times accidentally.

10:47.709 --> 10:49.410
That's disgusting.

10:49.444 --> 10:51.679
It's a nice one--
smooth helmet. Good job, kid.

10:51.713 --> 10:53.280
Hey, I'm right there
with you all.

10:53.315 --> 10:54.682
It's a good-looking cock,
no homo.

10:54.716 --> 10:56.517
- You guys are swell.
- Well...

10:59.220 --> 11:02.356
Krull, my good man.
Welcome.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.591
Seriously,
with this fucking guy again?

11:04.626 --> 11:05.960
Hello, love.

11:05.994 --> 11:07.594
I've been seeing
a lot of you lately...

11:07.629 --> 11:09.063
in my dreams--

11:09.097 --> 11:11.966
me daydreams,
me wide-awake dreams,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.934
when I'm tugging meself.

11:13.969 --> 11:16.136
- Oh. Okay.
- That's neat. Thanks.

11:16.171 --> 11:18.839
Charlie, are you just gonna let
this degenerate

11:18.873 --> 11:20.507
talk to me like that?

11:20.542 --> 11:22.509
This degenerate
happens to be a client, Marcy.

11:22.544 --> 11:25.612
Besides, he is complimenting
you, right, Krull?

11:25.647 --> 11:27.147
- Absolutely, love.
- Oh.

11:27.182 --> 11:28.716
And, yeah, I noticed
you never have a problem

11:28.750 --> 11:30.150
when a certain
perverted millionaire

11:30.185 --> 11:31.885
talks to you like that.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.755
Excuse me. I was married
to that perverted millionaire.

11:34.789 --> 11:36.523
Hello, Hank.

11:36.558 --> 11:37.891
Krull, good to see you, my man.

11:37.926 --> 11:39.360
You too, buddy.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.395
- I drove him back, you know.
- Oh, nice.

11:41.429 --> 11:43.864
- On the back of me bike.
- Mm-hmm, for you.

11:43.898 --> 11:45.399
Least you could've done
was give him some suction.

11:45.433 --> 11:48.068
- That was a long ride.
- Bumpy too.

11:48.103 --> 11:49.503
It kind of numbed out my taint.

11:49.537 --> 11:51.338
Yeah, that happens.
Who's this?

11:51.373 --> 11:53.907
- Hi. I'm Julia.
- Hello, love.

11:53.942 --> 11:55.509
Mm.

11:57.545 --> 11:59.513
Krull.
Rock 'n' roll butler.

11:59.581 --> 12:00.681
That's cool.

12:00.715 --> 12:02.316
Speaking of such things,

12:02.350 --> 12:04.385
I got some pages for you,
there, Churchill.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.553
Forgot about the time
when I walked in on Atticus,

12:06.588 --> 12:09.423
and he was blowing himself,
and I surprised him.

12:09.457 --> 12:11.592
He ended up blowing a load
on the pair of us.

12:11.626 --> 12:13.894
I got combat pay
for that one, though.

12:13.928 --> 12:15.429
You see, Marcy?
You see?

12:15.463 --> 12:17.223
This is exactly
the kind of salacious details

12:17.232 --> 12:19.099
that sells
these rock 'n' roll memoirs.

12:19.134 --> 12:21.435
Okay.

12:21.469 --> 12:24.004
Whoa.
Hi, Levon.

12:24.039 --> 12:26.206
Hello, hello, hello.

12:26.241 --> 12:27.708
Hey, everyone.

12:27.742 --> 12:29.510
Mom?
What are you doing here?

12:29.544 --> 12:31.545
Well, I just--I had to have
a word with your dad.

12:31.579 --> 12:33.013
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from him

12:33.048 --> 12:34.381
until he puts a ring
on that finger?

12:34.416 --> 12:35.949
Hey, what's that about?

12:35.984 --> 12:37.684
I don't want you
taking advantage of my moms, yo.

12:37.719 --> 12:39.119
What the--nobody's
taking advantage of her, yo.

12:39.154 --> 12:40.454
She's horny, single,

12:40.488 --> 12:42.189
and emotionally vulnerable
right now.

12:42.223 --> 12:44.064
Honey, that's enough, okay?
Who is your friend?

12:44.092 --> 12:45.793
- Can I get you a drink?
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.827 --> 12:47.294
Ah.

12:47.328 --> 12:48.629
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

12:48.663 --> 12:50.064
'Cause I've been busy hosting.

12:50.098 --> 12:52.199
- Who's your friend?
- This is Mi.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.934
Hey, hang on.
I know Mi.

12:55.503 --> 12:58.539
I knew you look familiar,
big boy.

12:58.573 --> 13:00.574
You pick me up on bike.

13:00.608 --> 13:02.910
That's right,
outside the All-American Burger.

13:02.944 --> 13:05.279
Yeah, you jerk off on me.

13:05.313 --> 13:06.814
That's a good memory.

13:06.848 --> 13:08.582
Mi got good head for tricks.

13:08.616 --> 13:11.085
Yeah, you sure do, darling.
You sure do.

13:11.119 --> 13:12.719
Oh.

13:12.754 --> 13:14.354
So I went to that
comic book store on Sunset.

13:14.389 --> 13:16.523
I met her when I was coming out.

13:16.558 --> 13:18.792
She was super nice,
real friendly.

13:18.827 --> 13:20.427
I guess I owe her more money

13:20.462 --> 13:21.929
than I currently have
on my person.

13:21.963 --> 13:23.564
- What did you do?
- Everything, dude.

13:23.598 --> 13:25.299
We went around
the fucking world--

13:25.333 --> 13:27.101
- in the butt and everything.
- Holy shit.

13:27.135 --> 13:28.902
She made me wear
a condom, though.

13:28.937 --> 13:31.472
- It was really hard to come.
- Too much. How much?

13:31.506 --> 13:33.874
Look, I don't want to limit
your sexual exploration,

13:33.908 --> 13:35.509
but you got to lay off
the hookers,

13:35.543 --> 13:37.678
because it's illegal,
and there's diseases.

13:37.712 --> 13:39.146
No, mama!

13:39.180 --> 13:42.082
- I make him put bag on it.
- Mi.

13:42.117 --> 13:43.550
That's good, I guess.

13:43.585 --> 13:45.085
He had a tough time...

13:45.120 --> 13:46.954
I did.
I'm sorry, mom.

13:46.988 --> 13:49.022
This is not what
a mother wants for her son.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.457
No.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.292
Julia, I told them that
the last time.

13:52.327 --> 13:53.961
- You did?
- Yes!

13:53.995 --> 13:55.762
God, thank you, Karen.
That is so sweet.

13:55.797 --> 13:57.498
You're so welcome.
I am so sorry.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.832
I don't understand.

13:58.867 --> 14:00.100
Yes.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.836
Rath.
What are you doing here?

14:02.871 --> 14:04.204
Hey.
Uh, is Hank around?

14:04.239 --> 14:06.473
Hank, sorry to bother you
at home,

14:06.508 --> 14:09.109
but a friend of yours insisted.

14:10.712 --> 14:12.212
Moody!

14:12.247 --> 14:13.687
Eddie Nero--
as I live and breathe.

14:13.715 --> 14:16.817
Ah!

14:19.587 --> 14:23.624
- Put me back in my chair.
- Okay. All right.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.394
No! It's okay.

14:27.428 --> 14:30.030
I'll do it myself.

14:36.838 --> 14:39.373
Dare I ask why
you're in a wheelchair?

14:39.407 --> 14:42.009
Have you finally
had your genitals removed?

14:42.043 --> 14:45.012
No, don't be silly.
It was just a flight of fancy--

14:45.046 --> 14:46.747
an a-lister's daydream.

14:46.781 --> 14:48.982
I thought I'd lost all my loads.

14:49.017 --> 14:53.053
Then your lovely soul mate
taught me otherwise.

14:53.087 --> 14:55.222
- Karen!
- Eddie.

14:55.256 --> 14:57.691
Let me pepper you with kisses.

14:57.725 --> 15:00.027
How are you?
It's so nice to see you.

15:00.061 --> 15:01.695
It's so good to see you, Karen.

15:01.729 --> 15:03.997
Good.

15:04.032 --> 15:05.899
- Okay.
- Ah, can you feel it?

15:05.934 --> 15:09.336
This is the site
of our erotic encounter.

15:09.370 --> 15:12.506
The wood of this humble abode
has absorbed my seed,

15:12.540 --> 15:14.174
my very essence.

15:14.209 --> 15:16.710
Are you as moist as I am?

15:16.744 --> 15:18.512
Hey, pussy fart.
How are you?

15:18.546 --> 15:20.247
Good, Eddie.
How are you?

15:20.281 --> 15:21.615
No, no.
I'm on duty.

15:21.649 --> 15:23.050
Ah, of course.
Karen?

15:23.084 --> 15:25.719
For my character,
that I will be essaying

15:25.753 --> 15:28.755
in an upcoming episode
of TV's <i> Santa Monica Cops,</i>

15:28.790 --> 15:30.457
which I have agreed to do

15:30.491 --> 15:32.059
because all the finest
movie stars

15:32.093 --> 15:33.560
are coming to television today.

15:33.595 --> 15:34.962
And why not?

15:34.996 --> 15:37.464
Two days on a set
plus a meaty monologue

15:37.498 --> 15:40.100
equals...
Emmy nomination!

15:40.134 --> 15:41.702
I'm going
for the motherfucking EGOT--

15:41.736 --> 15:44.805
Emmy, Golden Globe, Oscar, Tony.

15:44.839 --> 15:46.740
And for that,
I will provide sexual favors

15:46.774 --> 15:48.208
to Neil Patrick Harris,
if needed.

15:53.948 --> 15:57.284
Anyway, Moody, I need you
to write me a monologue.

15:57.318 --> 15:59.219
I miss our collaborations.

15:59.254 --> 16:01.622
Rath is a fine writer,
but he's terse.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.357
I need someone who can provide

16:03.391 --> 16:05.692
a glorious golden shower
of verbiage.

16:05.727 --> 16:07.761
And the Emmy goes...

16:07.829 --> 16:09.863
to Edward fucking Nero.

16:09.897 --> 16:11.164
Good God, there are
some beautiful women

16:11.199 --> 16:12.733
around here tonight.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.102
I'm glad I still have
all my loads.

16:15.136 --> 16:17.771
We could have quite
the bukkake party later.

16:17.805 --> 16:21.141
My character--
he cannot achieve an erection.

16:21.175 --> 16:22.776
He's been robbed of his manhood.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.711
But he's still a force
to be reckoned with.

16:24.746 --> 16:26.280
Ow!

16:26.314 --> 16:27.648
Ow!

16:27.682 --> 16:30.250
Hey! I know you...

16:30.285 --> 16:31.952
from Sunset and Gardner.

16:31.986 --> 16:34.521
Hey!
That right, motherfucker!

16:36.190 --> 16:40.327
Did not recognize you
with the mustache.

16:40.361 --> 16:42.996
Hey.
You poop on me.

16:43.031 --> 16:45.165
You're welcome.

16:53.908 --> 16:55.976
Good news--

16:56.010 --> 16:58.545
Rath's hitting it off
with Karen over there.

16:58.579 --> 17:00.781
- Why is that good news?
- Good news for me.

17:00.815 --> 17:02.716
He's staying the fuck away
from my mom for once.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.218
Yeah, well, guess who's
chatting up your fucking mom,

17:05.252 --> 17:08.155
- is Eddie fucking Nero.
- Yeah, we'll see.

17:08.189 --> 17:09.790
Movie star or not, that guy will
get the fucking stink finger

17:09.824 --> 17:11.290
- if he tries anything.
- No, no, no. No.

17:11.326 --> 17:12.858
Stink finger
is powerless over him.

17:12.894 --> 17:14.560
Dude poops on people.

17:14.595 --> 17:16.463
Ugh.
That's fucking unsettling.

17:16.497 --> 17:18.065
- You think?
- Yeah.

17:18.098 --> 17:19.098
Hmm.

17:21.035 --> 17:23.737
Hi.
What's going on here?

17:23.771 --> 17:26.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:26.074 --> 17:28.241
Um, well, I was just having
the greatest conversation

17:28.276 --> 17:30.177
- with your boss.
- Oh.

17:30.211 --> 17:32.479
Yeah, well, he's not really
my boss, per se.

17:32.513 --> 17:34.414
Well, how else
would you put it, Hank?

17:34.449 --> 17:37.150
I like to think of us
as compatriots,

17:37.185 --> 17:39.252
you know, birds of a feather,
kindred spirits,

17:39.287 --> 17:42.589
writers, men...

17:42.623 --> 17:44.725
- men.
- I hired you. I can fire you.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.093
I'd say that makes me your boss.

17:46.127 --> 17:48.061
Okay, fine.
Yeah, be that way.

17:48.096 --> 17:49.763
You know,
this evening started out

17:49.797 --> 17:53.600
as an attempted intimate dinner
for the two of us.

17:53.634 --> 17:56.236
And at some point,
I would like to...

17:56.270 --> 17:57.904
- Um, yeah.
- Get back to...

17:57.939 --> 17:59.639
- Well, it's okay, sweetie.
- That particular--

17:59.674 --> 18:02.175
'Cause I can--
I can catch up with you anytime.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.944
I mean, you know,

18:03.978 --> 18:06.513
I don't know when I'm next
gonna get to see Rick.

18:06.547 --> 18:09.015
We can see each other
as often as you like, Karen,

18:09.050 --> 18:10.684
because you guys
aren't together, right?

18:10.718 --> 18:11.685
- Well...
- Right.

18:11.719 --> 18:13.420
I mean, that's a--

18:13.454 --> 18:15.288
Yeah, well, these things
are very complicated with Hank.

18:15.323 --> 18:16.723
You know, I asked him
about Julia.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.291
He said he wasn't involved
with her.

18:18.326 --> 18:20.394
Next thing you know,
he was inside of her, so...

18:20.428 --> 18:23.864
Inside of her?
Wow.

18:23.898 --> 18:25.899
Um, okay.

18:25.933 --> 18:27.868
Yeah, well, why am I surprised?

18:27.902 --> 18:30.170
I mean, of course he was.

18:31.939 --> 18:34.107
Well...it's just
as well I like her, I guess.

18:35.710 --> 18:39.379
- I'll get that.
- I got it. I got it.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.381
- Hello, Leon.
- It's Levon.

18:41.416 --> 18:44.351
Why is that so fucking hard
for people to get?

18:44.385 --> 18:46.386
Charlie, Marcy,

18:46.421 --> 18:48.655
so sorry to barge in
on you guys like this,

18:48.689 --> 18:51.024
but I must have a word.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.994
Hello, Edward.
How are you, brah?

18:54.028 --> 18:55.929
Stu, my favorite moneyman!

18:55.963 --> 18:57.664
Stu, I'm not even gonna
get up off this fucking couch

18:57.698 --> 18:59.166
to deal with this shit.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.501
First of all,
thanks to Eddie Nero here,

19:01.536 --> 19:03.403
my fucking knee is killing me.

19:03.438 --> 19:06.006
Besides, everyone knows, Stu.
Everyone knows.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.408
Well, in that case...

19:10.678 --> 19:12.913
Look away, Marcy!
Look away!

19:12.947 --> 19:16.683
- But it's so beautiful.
- And it's all yours.

19:16.717 --> 19:18.485
Just say the word

19:18.519 --> 19:22.289
and, uh, sign right here
on the dotted line

19:22.323 --> 19:24.691
and if you could initial
here and here.

19:24.725 --> 19:27.360
Stu, was is it about this woman?

19:27.395 --> 19:30.530
Edward,
I'm so glad you asked me.

19:30.565 --> 19:32.432
Entering her is like walking

19:32.467 --> 19:35.302
into the most wonderful
candy store in the world.

19:35.336 --> 19:39.539
Spending time inside of her
is akin to cocooning yourself

19:39.574 --> 19:42.309
in the softest,
most exotic of silks.

19:42.343 --> 19:44.611
I remember
I used to be able to press

19:44.645 --> 19:46.513
on her cute little tummy

19:46.547 --> 19:48.248
and feel myself
just throbbing away in there.

19:48.282 --> 19:49.483
The hum was electric.

19:49.517 --> 19:51.518
You have to remember
that, Marcy.

19:51.552 --> 19:56.056
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- I'm gonna throw the fuck up.

19:56.090 --> 19:58.492
If sex is what allows us

19:58.526 --> 20:02.162
to transcend this average,
everyday, humdrum existence

20:02.196 --> 20:05.465
and get us
that much closer to God,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.234
then it was with Marcy

20:07.268 --> 20:11.905
that I came within
spitting distance of my maker.

20:11.939 --> 20:14.241
What has happened to you, Stu?

20:14.275 --> 20:16.142
Have you lost your fucking mind?

20:16.177 --> 20:18.478
Perhaps I need to experience
this pint-sized powerhouse.

20:18.513 --> 20:20.180
I've seen her go at it.

20:20.214 --> 20:22.449
She's like a feral cat
with a greedy snatch.

20:22.483 --> 20:24.584
Greedy snatch!
Give me, give me, give me!

20:24.619 --> 20:26.453
- All for it, none for you.
- What?

20:26.487 --> 20:30.490
Well, consider this
a signing bonus--10% up front.

20:30.525 --> 20:33.894
Do with it what you will.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.929
- We have to talk.
- Ow!

20:35.963 --> 20:37.764
Come here.

20:37.798 --> 20:39.232
- Listen to me.
- What?

20:39.267 --> 20:40.934
This kind of cash could get us

20:40.968 --> 20:42.869
out of all
of our immediate debt.

20:42.904 --> 20:45.539
Marcy, I have put out feelers
about the Krull book,

20:45.573 --> 20:48.241
and I could get us
at least that much...

20:48.276 --> 20:49.709
Almost.

20:49.744 --> 20:51.578
What about next month?
And the month after?

20:51.612 --> 20:53.780
Runkle, don't kid yourself.
Things are tough out there.

20:53.814 --> 20:55.549
I'm offering you
some sweet relief.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.551
I mean, give yourself a break.

20:57.585 --> 21:00.720
And you got to think
about little Stuart, huh?

21:00.755 --> 21:02.355
My namesake.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.724
Stu, you have got to stop
disrespecting me

21:04.759 --> 21:06.426
in my own home!

21:06.460 --> 21:11.131
Oh, this is clearly a rental.

21:11.165 --> 21:12.966
Hit him!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.334
Ow! Ow!

21:14.368 --> 21:16.236
Ow!

21:16.270 --> 21:18.204
Okay, Runkle...

21:18.239 --> 21:21.241
now you pushed me too far.

21:23.444 --> 21:25.612
I'm gonna--

21:25.646 --> 21:29.816
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Stop it!

21:29.850 --> 21:31.051
Charlie!

21:34.922 --> 21:36.957
All right.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.860
My boy Runkle's got some serious
retard strength right now.

21:40.895 --> 21:42.762
- Just--yeah.
- Come on.

21:42.797 --> 21:43.897
Get him off.

21:43.931 --> 21:46.232
No fighting!
Not on my watch!

21:46.267 --> 21:48.001
Holy shit.
That thing is real?

21:48.035 --> 21:49.736
When I'm in research mode,
I go all out.

21:49.770 --> 21:51.671
I'm not fucking around.

21:51.706 --> 21:54.106
Okay, I'm calling the network.
I cannot work with this guy.

21:54.108 --> 21:57.243
- I thought Hashtag was bad.
- No one should fight like this.

21:57.278 --> 21:58.678
No man should fight like this.

21:58.713 --> 22:01.047
Last time I was here,
I fought much like this

22:01.082 --> 22:03.149
with a man named Hank Moody,

22:03.184 --> 22:06.419
who bested me that night
and deservedly so.

22:06.454 --> 22:07.854
And do you know why?

22:07.888 --> 22:10.457
Because I slept with his woman.

22:10.491 --> 22:11.658
Wheelchair or not, Nero,

22:11.692 --> 22:13.693
I will kick you
in the fucking cock.

22:13.728 --> 22:16.563
There's no need.
I have a confession to make.

22:16.597 --> 22:20.200
I did not penetrate
your beloved that night.

22:20.234 --> 22:22.202
I fully intended to,

22:22.236 --> 22:26.873
but I hadn't come with a woman
in so long that I merely...

22:26.907 --> 22:30.410
- made wet in my tunic.
- Whoa.

22:30.444 --> 22:32.045
She did me the great honor

22:32.079 --> 22:34.481
of making it seem
like we made sweet love,

22:34.515 --> 22:36.349
which is why she is such
an incredible woman.

22:36.384 --> 22:38.151
What is this, fucking Christmas?

22:38.185 --> 22:40.453
This is great news.
Why didn't you tell me that?

22:40.488 --> 22:42.922
Because I didn't want
to betray Eddie's confidence.

22:42.957 --> 22:44.624
Uh-huh.

22:44.659 --> 22:46.359
Her loveliness is giving me
an erection right now...

22:46.394 --> 22:48.028
No.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.295
In spite of my best efforts
to stay in character.

22:49.330 --> 22:50.764
You know, and also,

22:50.798 --> 22:52.732
I kind of wanted you
to think that we had.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.534
Oh, really?
You did, did you?

22:54.568 --> 22:58.038
Karen, if you would grant me
another chance,

22:58.072 --> 23:00.674
I am reasonably sure
I could penetrate you

23:00.708 --> 23:02.742
in a satisfactory manner...

23:04.178 --> 23:06.246
Although
you would have to lift me up

23:06.280 --> 23:08.415
off of the chair into the bed.

23:08.449 --> 23:10.209
Have you ever had sex
with a handicapped man?

23:10.217 --> 23:11.751
Eddie, I think we had a moment,

23:11.786 --> 23:13.887
and I think
that moment's passed.

23:13.921 --> 23:16.423
Oh.

23:16.457 --> 23:18.358
Thank you for your honesty.

23:18.392 --> 23:19.659
What about you, Goldilocks?

23:19.694 --> 23:21.695
You ever made love
to a paraplegic?

23:21.729 --> 23:23.263
Actually, I did once.

23:23.297 --> 23:26.066
I really liked him,
but then Levon scared him away.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.567
He told him
if he tried anything funny,

23:27.601 --> 23:30.103
he'd pushed him into traffic.

23:30.137 --> 23:32.238
What?
I was young and angry, okay?

23:32.273 --> 23:34.741
I didn't have a fucking father.

23:34.775 --> 23:36.276
He was really good at oral sex.

23:36.310 --> 23:38.378
Gross. That's fucking foul.

23:38.412 --> 23:40.346
I knew I should've pushed
that fucking gimp into traffic.

23:40.381 --> 23:42.048
Hey, that's not nice.

23:44.418 --> 23:46.753
I'm sorry to say, yes.
I mean, he was really good.

23:46.787 --> 23:48.221
- That's rough.
- Whoa!

23:48.255 --> 23:50.590
Not any better
than Edward R. Nero,

23:50.624 --> 23:53.259
who is nothing
if not a cunning linguist.

23:53.294 --> 23:55.061
You know,
I'm a single mom, Eddie.

23:55.096 --> 23:56.763
And I'm not easily wooed.

23:56.797 --> 23:58.965
I'm a single father
with millions of dollars

23:58.999 --> 24:00.834
and unlimited loads.

24:00.868 --> 24:05.004
"Unrimited roads"?

24:05.039 --> 24:07.707
Empty your pockets, bitches!

24:07.742 --> 24:09.809
Everyone do exactly
what she says.

24:09.844 --> 24:11.578
I am in extraordinary shape,

24:11.612 --> 24:15.982
but I do not think I could
survive a bullet in the head.

24:16.016 --> 24:18.284
- Okay.
- Come on!

24:18.319 --> 24:20.453
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Nope.

24:20.488 --> 24:23.123
Hurry! Now!

24:23.157 --> 24:24.657
I thought you used to be a cop.

24:24.692 --> 24:26.926
- Shut up.
- I was a fucking transit cop.

24:26.961 --> 24:29.229
Okay? What difference
does it make anyway.

24:29.263 --> 24:31.331
I don't have a gun on me.

24:40.174 --> 24:43.743
Edward!

24:43.778 --> 24:45.745
Ow!

24:45.780 --> 24:48.948
Later, bitches!

24:48.983 --> 24:50.850
Bye, Mi.

24:50.885 --> 24:52.519
- Hey!
- I had fun tonight.

24:52.553 --> 24:56.489
That's mine!

24:56.524 --> 24:58.024
Aren't you glad we didn't go

24:58.058 --> 25:00.460
to some boring place
on Abbot Kinney?

25:00.494 --> 25:03.062
Do you think
Eddie's gonna be okay?

25:03.097 --> 25:04.817
He seemed all right
as they were loading him

25:04.832 --> 25:06.432
into the ambulance.

25:06.467 --> 25:08.768
He asked me to email him
the draft of the monologue asap

25:08.803 --> 25:11.137
so he can start learning
his lines.

25:12.807 --> 25:14.574
It's not like
he's actually human or anything.

25:14.608 --> 25:17.443
I think he's gonna be fine.

25:17.478 --> 25:19.712
Isn't it crazy
how nothing good ever happens

25:19.747 --> 25:21.815
in Charlie and Marcy's house?

25:21.849 --> 25:23.783
It's like that place was built

25:23.818 --> 25:27.187
on some Indian burial ground
or something.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.055
Yeah. It's like
there's a whole bunch

25:29.089 --> 25:33.359
of horny Malibu Indians
rolling around underneath there.

25:33.394 --> 25:35.495
I don't know.

25:35.529 --> 25:39.732
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:39.767 --> 25:42.969
Hey, at least I learned that you
didn't do sex with Eddie Nero,

25:43.003 --> 25:46.906
so I will sleep easier tonight.

25:46.941 --> 25:50.543
And I learned
that you recently did do sex

25:50.578 --> 25:53.713
with the mother
of your first child.

25:53.747 --> 25:56.516
I'm sorry about that.

25:56.550 --> 25:59.319
Why?
It's your life.

25:59.353 --> 26:01.154
If there's something about it
you don't like,

26:01.188 --> 26:02.255
you could change it.

26:02.289 --> 26:05.325
- I am trying.
- Hank...

26:05.359 --> 26:07.160
again, I ask you why.

26:07.194 --> 26:10.396
You thrive on chaos.

26:10.431 --> 26:14.033
I mean, you need to be
in the middle

26:14.068 --> 26:18.204
of some kind of mess
of your own creation, right?

26:18.239 --> 26:22.909
That's what makes you
attractive...

26:22.943 --> 26:27.947
and also impossible
to live with.

26:27.982 --> 26:31.651
"Impossible"
is a very strong word, Karen.

26:35.322 --> 26:37.957
Hank, I love you...

26:40.594 --> 26:43.129
but I can't be with you.

26:43.163 --> 26:45.798
When will you accept that?

26:45.833 --> 26:49.302
Never.

26:49.336 --> 26:52.972
It's also
what makes me attractive.

26:55.509 --> 26:57.377
Yeah...

26:57.411 --> 27:00.480
and very lonely.
