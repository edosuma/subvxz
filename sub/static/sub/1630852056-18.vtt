00:01.100 --> 00:02.266
He was your boyfriend?

00:02.333 --> 00:03.567
Yes.

00:03.633 --> 00:04.567
You had a fight?

00:05.934 --> 00:07.800
She had taken out a knife.

00:07.867 --> 00:09.467
It was just hell.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.333
And you were in fact arrested.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.100
Um...

00:50.467 --> 00:52.433
Hello, Judge. Case 1047,

00:52.500 --> 00:54.667
Muhammad-Bishop Muhammad
versus Casteneda.

00:54.734 --> 00:56.300
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.567
He was your boyfriend?

00:58.633 --> 00:59.667
Yes, ma'am.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.266
-[Judy] This is your mother?
-Yes.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.600
[Judy] Two of you
have a child together?

01:02.667 --> 01:03.734
[Jasmine] Yes.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.600
[Judy] How old is that child?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.333
He's currently 21 months.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.834
[Judy] You lived together
for a while?

01:07.900 --> 01:08.834
Yes.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.200
[Judy] In his apartment?

01:10.266 --> 01:11.266
Yes.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.367
How long did you live
together in his apartment?

01:13.433 --> 01:15.233
For about 19 days.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.667
[Judy] Prior to that,
where did you live?

01:16.734 --> 01:17.934
Um, in my mother's home.

01:18.000 --> 01:18.934
[Judy] With him?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.300
-[Jasmine] Yes.
-[Judy] And the baby?

01:20.367 --> 01:21.300
[Jasmine] Yes.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.367
[Judy] This is what
the case is about.

01:22.433 --> 01:26.033
Then I'll get into the facts
that support your allegations.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.200
You had a fight?

01:27.266 --> 01:28.834
-Yes.
-[Judy] You left the house,

01:28.900 --> 01:30.133
you say, to cool off.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.834
That fight ended in you
ultimately separating,

01:33.900 --> 01:35.500
and you going back
to your mother's house?

01:35.567 --> 01:36.834
-Yes.
-[Judy] According to you,

01:36.900 --> 01:40.667
when you left,
the baby remained with him?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.066
-[Jasmine] Yes.
-[Judy] How old was the baby

01:42.133 --> 01:43.500
at that time?

01:43.567 --> 01:44.967
He was seven months.

01:45.033 --> 01:46.967
[Judy] And in what month
was that, and year?

01:47.033 --> 01:49.333
Uh, June of 2020.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.600
Well, we're now a year later,

01:50.667 --> 01:53.567
and it looks to me as if you're
about to have another baby.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.367
[smiles] Yes, ma'am.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.200
[Judy] And who's the father
of that baby?

01:57.266 --> 01:59.000
Um, Anthony.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.133
[Judy] Do you live with him?

02:00.200 --> 02:01.166
Uh, no.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.133
Who do you live with?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.867
I still reside
at my mother's home.

02:03.934 --> 02:05.266
[Judy] Do you see Anthony?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.266
Yes.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.333
How often?

02:07.400 --> 02:11.767
Often, like maybe on
a weekly basis, not every day.

02:11.834 --> 02:12.967
[Judy] Does he have
other children?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.467
-No.
-[Judy] Do you work?

02:14.533 --> 02:15.533
[Jasmine] Yes, ma'am.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.066
-For whom?
-Children's Choice,

02:17.133 --> 02:18.367
I'm a dental assistant.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.133
How do you divide custody

02:20.200 --> 02:23.133
between you and the defendant,
of your son?

02:23.200 --> 02:25.367
We have a custody order by--

02:25.433 --> 02:28.300
order by the court,
um, joint custody

02:28.367 --> 02:30.300
and his main residency
is with me.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.367
[Judy] Is that what
the order says?

02:31.433 --> 02:32.433
Correct.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.433
The order says that physical
custody is with his mom,

02:35.500 --> 02:37.567
even though it was with me
in the beginning.

02:37.633 --> 02:38.567
How often do you see him?

02:38.633 --> 02:40.367
I get him Wednesday
ten to five,

02:40.433 --> 02:43.200
and then Saturday
through Monday.

02:43.266 --> 02:45.133
He leaves
Monday eight a.m.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.400
I get him early Saturday at ten.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.767
So, I get him about
three or four times a week.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.934
Try to balance it out
as much as I can.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.266
Do you exercise that time?

02:54.333 --> 02:55.533
Yes.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.734
[Judy] Is that correct?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.233
No, he does not get him
as he's supposed to.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.834
When was this order made?

03:00.900 --> 03:03.266
It was made in August of 2020.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.300
[Judy]
And when does he take him?

03:05.367 --> 03:09.133
Whenever his schedule
approves or-- it's up to him.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.066
You mean,
because his work schedule.

03:11.133 --> 03:12.700
Um, he says
sometimes it's his schedule

03:12.767 --> 03:14.367
or he's got other things
that he has to do.

03:14.433 --> 03:15.300
What I'm asking you is,

03:15.367 --> 03:17.967
does he see him
from Saturday to Monday?

03:18.033 --> 03:18.967
-Yes.
-[Judy] All right.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.533
So, he sees him from
Saturday through Monday.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.433
Monday, he brings him home to you.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.900
Mm-mm. We meet at a,
um, a location.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.900
We have an agreeable location
at Starbucks, public.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.633
[Judy] When you were living
together with the defendant,

03:30.700 --> 03:31.667
were you working?

03:31.734 --> 03:32.767
Yes, ma'am.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.633
And there were things that
were purchased for the baby.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.667
Was he working?

03:36.734 --> 03:37.667
[Jasmine] Yes.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.066
[Judy] Are you working
at the same place, sir?

03:39.133 --> 03:40.633
Currently not at the moment. Uh,

03:40.700 --> 03:42.867
I got terminated
after COVID, so--

03:42.934 --> 03:45.367
When you were living
together, were you working?

03:45.433 --> 03:46.734
[Angel] Yes.
The termination

03:46.800 --> 03:49.266
didn't happen
till about August 2020.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.633
You're asking for
the return of value of property,

03:51.700 --> 03:53.500
and the property
that you talk about,

03:53.567 --> 03:58.133
in this order,
are a stroller, a crib,

03:58.200 --> 04:01.266
a laptop, clothing,
and electronics.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.066
So, let's take that,
one piece at a time.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.333
Stroller.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.166
Let's hear about it.

04:08.233 --> 04:09.233
Okay. Um...

04:09.300 --> 04:11.767
well, regarding the property
and the stroller,

04:11.834 --> 04:13.300
the stroller was never returned.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.567
Returned to whom?

04:14.633 --> 04:17.133
Me, me and my mother.
It was never returned to us.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.734
-It was--
-It's not you and your mother.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.467
He has the child
since you were never married.

04:21.533 --> 04:22.467
Mm-mm.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.867
Property belongs to
the person who purchased it.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.000
Yes. Mm-mm.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.934
[Judy] Who purchased
the stroller?

04:29.000 --> 04:29.934
My mother.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.166
[Judy] Is that correct?

04:31.233 --> 04:32.233
That's true.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.767
Okay. And when you
purchased the stroller,

04:34.834 --> 04:37.367
you made a gift of it to whom?

04:37.433 --> 04:38.567
Jasmine.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.367
[Judy]
She wants the stroller back.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.433
All right.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.934
Great. I'm glad
you agree with me.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.200
That's always important.

04:45.266 --> 04:46.233
[laughing]

04:46.300 --> 04:48.300
[Judy] A crib.
Who purchased the crib?

04:48.367 --> 04:49.300
My father.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.367
[Judy] He's not here.

04:51.433 --> 04:54.033
A laptop.
Do you have her laptop?

04:54.100 --> 04:55.133
I do not.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.700
[Judy] Tell me about the laptop.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.734
Um, the laptop is
something that my mother owned,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.166
but I often used a lot

05:00.233 --> 05:02.333
because I was also currently
enrolled at college for a bit,

05:02.400 --> 05:04.400
so I used it
for college courses.

05:04.467 --> 05:05.734
[Judy] He says
he doesn't have it.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.400
I don't know.
He might have thrown it away.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.500
Did you have
possession of her laptop?

05:10.567 --> 05:12.500
I did not. Honestly,
we're not saying that--

05:12.567 --> 05:14.600
I'm not too sure
what she's talking about.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.166
More than half her things
were already gone.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.800
The cops looked into my place,
searched everything.

05:20.867 --> 05:23.567
They didn't find anything
of her there, of hers there.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.133
Sorry about that.
And, uh, they just took her--

05:27.200 --> 05:29.734
Are you telling me
that the police took her laptop?

05:29.800 --> 05:32.333
No. They did
a thorough search of my place

05:32.400 --> 05:33.867
to make sure
if any of her belongings--

05:33.934 --> 05:35.066
[Judy]
No, no, you can't tell me

05:35.133 --> 05:38.233
that the police did
a thorough search of a place.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.667
She says that she left
a laptop in your house.

05:41.734 --> 05:44.500
You both had a fight,
which we'll get into in a minute.

05:44.567 --> 05:45.500
[sighs]

05:45.567 --> 05:46.500
-[Judy] So--
-I don't believe

05:46.567 --> 05:49.600
I seen a laptop.
I can't recall she left it with me.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.000
Okay. What electronics
are you talking about?

05:53.066 --> 05:54.400
The laptop and the, uh,

05:54.467 --> 05:56.967
I had an Xfinity router
in my name.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.300
An Xfinity router.

05:59.367 --> 06:00.433
[Jasmine] For internet.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Did you buy that?

06:01.567 --> 06:02.667
I was paying the internet

06:02.734 --> 06:04.400
and for the router
to be installed there

06:04.467 --> 06:06.100
because we had got
the apartment together.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.133
[Judy] And?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.233
[Jasmine]
And it was never returned.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.300
So, I had to pay a fee
for the router.

06:11.367 --> 06:12.800
[Judy] And how much was that?

06:12.867 --> 06:14.033
About 232 dollars.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.533
[Judy] Not about 200.
Let me see the bill.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.500
Where's the router?

06:17.567 --> 06:18.433
Do you have it
in your apartment?

06:18.500 --> 06:19.600
I do not.

06:19.667 --> 06:20.834
Well, you should have.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.934
[dramatic music]

06:25.033 --> 06:27.767
Defendant says
you were very upset that day...

06:27.834 --> 06:31.400
...and agitated, and you actually
had a knife in your hand.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.967
Whatever happened with
that knife, I don't know.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.066
Clearly, you've calmed down enough

06:36.133 --> 06:38.667
to find another guy
and to be having another baby.

06:38.734 --> 06:41.467
So, whatever was bothering you,
is not bothering you anymore.

06:52.967 --> 06:55.066
[narrator] <i>Twenty-year old</i>
<i>Jasmine Muhammad-Bishop</i>

06:55.133 --> 06:57.133
<i>and her mother Teresa Muhammad</i>

06:57.200 --> 07:00.834
<i>claim Jasmine's</i>
<i>ex-boyfriend, Angel Casteneda,</i>

07:00.900 --> 07:02.834
<i>threw away Jasmine's property.</i>

07:02.900 --> 07:06.900
<i>They also claim Angel filed</i>
<i>false charges against Jasmine.</i>

07:06.967 --> 07:09.100
Okay. When you go home,
you check for the router.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.266
-Okay?
-Sounds good.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.900
[Judy] Now, did there come a
time when any of your relatives,

07:12.967 --> 07:14.867
your mother, anybody else,

07:14.934 --> 07:17.567
come to the house
and take any of your property

07:17.633 --> 07:19.967
that was in the house
that the defendant gave them?

07:20.033 --> 07:23.266
Any personal property?
Any cosmetics? Anything?

07:23.333 --> 07:24.767
He wouldn't let anyone in.

07:24.834 --> 07:27.567
[Judy] Okay. I want you
to describe the evening

07:27.633 --> 07:30.300
when the defendant
left the house.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.300
Sounds good.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.000
So, that evening,
I came back that morning

07:33.066 --> 07:34.800
from my witness' house.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.700
And I was just talking to him,
you know,

07:37.767 --> 07:39.033
about the whole week,
it was just hell.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.200
The whole week
she was just telling me

07:40.266 --> 07:41.834
she didn't want my son,
she didn't want me,

07:41.900 --> 07:43.000
want anything to do with my son,

07:43.066 --> 07:44.934
didn't love me,
didn't love my son.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.333
So, as soon as
I came back to my place,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.433
she already had a knife
in her hands.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.934
And I put my son on the ground.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.767
I'm telling her,
"What are you doing?"

07:52.834 --> 07:55.100
And out of nowhere,
she's trying to come at me.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.500
Could you--
could you look at me?

07:56.567 --> 07:57.767
[Angel] Yes. She's trying to

07:57.834 --> 07:58.934
lunge at me
forward a little bit.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.100
[Judy] No, then now you're
looking down at the desk.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.100
I want you to look at me.
See, how I'm looking at you.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.033
So, as I come in, she has
a knife in her hands already.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.633
I don't know what she was trying
to do to herself, doing to me.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.667
I just told her like,
"Look, you need to leave.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.300
My son is here.
I worry about him.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.467
I'm trying to look after him,
just leave."

08:16.533 --> 08:18.066
Cool down,
like we said earlier.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.533
Just need her to cool down.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.367
[sighs]
About four or five hours later--

08:22.433 --> 08:23.667
See,
now you're looking up again.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.667
[Angel] Sorry about that.
About four hours later,

08:25.734 --> 08:27.934
she comes back with her mom
with the cops.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.567
Cops come in my door,
come in my house.

08:30.633 --> 08:33.400
They asked me what's going on.
I tell them the situation.

08:33.467 --> 08:36.967
I didn't call 'em at first.
They called first on me.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.734
They said I was abducting
my own child.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.166
So, I had to show 'em
the birth certificate

08:41.233 --> 08:42.834
to prove that I was the father.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.500
Once I proved
that I was the father,

08:44.567 --> 08:46.667
the cops took full control
of the situation,

08:46.734 --> 08:48.700
asked her what else happened.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.567
And then from there,
they just took her.

08:50.633 --> 08:54.500
So, you told them
that she had taken out a knife?

08:54.567 --> 08:55.500
Correct.

08:55.567 --> 08:56.800
And you were
in fact arrested?

08:56.867 --> 08:57.867
Yes, I was.

08:57.934 --> 08:59.934
[Judy] Yeah.
When you were arrested,

09:00.066 --> 09:01.433
were you interviewed
by the police?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.233
[Jasmine] The female officer
that was present

09:03.300 --> 09:04.600
had taken my statement
regarding--

09:04.667 --> 09:06.633
-'cause my mother had called.
-[Judy] No, no, don't.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.633
Just a second.

09:07.700 --> 09:11.633
I would like to see the report
of the female officer

09:11.700 --> 09:13.633
because that's part
of this lawsuit.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.066
Do you have a police report
with the narratives?

09:28.133 --> 09:29.066
Yes.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.633
[Judy] May I see it, please?

09:32.433 --> 09:33.767
It's both of these.

09:44.266 --> 09:46.467
[Judy] You were granted
a temporary restraining order.

09:46.533 --> 09:47.467
Is that right, sir?

09:47.533 --> 09:48.467
Yes, Your Honor.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.133
Was that temporary
restraining order

09:50.200 --> 09:52.367
made final, ever?

09:52.433 --> 09:53.367
[Angel] Yeah.

09:53.433 --> 09:56.100
The next court date
was on July 22nd,

09:56.166 --> 09:58.834
30 days after the
restraining order was in place.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.100
And they extended it
only because

10:00.166 --> 10:02.266
she didn't show up,
her lawyer showed up.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.367
-They extended it?
-Uh-huh.

10:04.433 --> 10:05.834
-"Uh-huh" is not an answer.
-[Angel] For another 30 days,

10:05.900 --> 10:07.000
so it was a two-month--

10:07.066 --> 10:10.400
until she showed up to court
to try to get joint for my son.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.200
The temporary
restraining order,

10:12.266 --> 10:14.900
was there ever a hearing on
the temporary restraining order?

10:14.967 --> 10:16.367
Yeah, it was on this--

10:16.433 --> 10:18.433
uh, the first hearing
was on seven-22nd.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.600
And I-I showed up.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.533
Yes. Was there a trial?
You said she didn't show up.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.800
She didn't show up.
Her lawyer did.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.367
[Judy] Okay, where were you?

10:25.433 --> 10:27.000
Um, I was home.

10:27.066 --> 10:28.133
-My lawyer showed up.
-[Judy] Why didn't you show up?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
Why didn't you go
to court with your lawyer?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.800
Because I also wanted to, uh,

10:31.867 --> 10:34.033
file a restraining order
against Angel.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.233
[whispers] That's not what it was.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.066
[Jasmine whispers] I'm sorry.

10:37.133 --> 10:40.066
[laughs] D-don't speak.
No, don't speak.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.867
So, the reason
that you didn't show up

10:41.934 --> 10:44.500
on the return date
and sent your lawyer

10:44.567 --> 10:50.266
is because this incident
occurred on July the 7th,

10:50.333 --> 10:52.467
or just prior thereto.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.300
And the temporary
order of protection

10:54.367 --> 10:56.233
was issued on July 7th.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.834
I assume between July 7th
and July 22nd,

10:59.900 --> 11:01.300
you got an attorney?

11:01.367 --> 11:02.166
Yes.

11:02.233 --> 11:05.066
And I assume
that you were advised

11:05.133 --> 11:08.233
not to appear in court
on the adjourn date

11:08.300 --> 11:13.533
because between July 7th
and July 22nd,

11:13.600 --> 11:16.000
which was when the case
was next on in court

11:16.066 --> 11:18.166
when you didn't appear?
Is that the right date?

11:18.233 --> 11:19.333
Yes, that is
the right date.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.000
Yes, something happened.
Listen to me carefully.

11:23.066 --> 11:26.033
I want you to tell me
what happened between

11:26.100 --> 11:30.400
July 7th and July 22nd, with him.

11:30.467 --> 11:31.433
Um, nothing had.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.800
Nothing happened?
Well, if nothing happened,

11:34.867 --> 11:38.867
then there was no reason
for you not to go to court

11:38.934 --> 11:42.300
to respond to this
order of protection,

11:42.367 --> 11:45.133
because there was
no new information,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.333
except that you got a lawyer
who advised you

11:48.400 --> 11:50.667
that strategically,
it would be a good idea

11:50.734 --> 11:53.066
if you filed for
an order of protection.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.200
Because if you tell me
nothing happened

11:55.266 --> 12:02.333
between the 7th and the 22nd,
you tell me what you alleged,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.333
because you filed
an order of protection

12:04.400 --> 12:07.233
against him
through your lawyer,

12:07.300 --> 12:09.000
and I want to see
what you alleged

12:09.066 --> 12:12.200
in that order of protection
that you filed against him.

12:12.266 --> 12:14.166
I want to see what you alleged.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.567
Um, I don't have
the supporting documentation.

12:19.633 --> 12:20.433
I have a police report.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.667
The police report
gives two different versions

12:22.734 --> 12:23.967
of what happened that day.

12:24.033 --> 12:27.533
The defendant says that
you were very upset that day

12:27.600 --> 12:30.834
and agitated, and you actually
had a knife in your hand.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.400
Whatever happened
with that knife, I don't know.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.567
Clearly,
you've calmed down enough

12:35.633 --> 12:38.500
to find another guy
and to be having another baby,

12:38.567 --> 12:40.133
so that whatever
was bothering you

12:40.200 --> 12:41.734
is not bothering you anymore.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.500
Now, when they finally
reached you,

12:44.567 --> 12:46.333
you said
I never had a knife.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.066
And I never threatened him,
and I never threatened the baby.

12:49.133 --> 12:50.934
So, I have
two different versions,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.667
which is why you have a hearing.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.467
But that's what was alleged
in the police report.

12:55.533 --> 12:59.467
Now, do you have a police report
that you made for any incident

12:59.533 --> 13:04.133
that happened between
July 7th and July 22nd

13:04.200 --> 13:06.166
when you were supposed
to be back in court

13:06.233 --> 13:08.066
to answer
the order of protection?

13:08.133 --> 13:09.000
No.

13:09.066 --> 13:11.333
No? What?

13:11.400 --> 13:14.500
If I may.
I filed a domestic violence

13:14.567 --> 13:16.233
restraining order
against Angel as well,

13:16.300 --> 13:18.433
because there had been
previous history.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.266
Well, you didn't
file it before.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.767
You only filed it
after he filed his,

13:22.834 --> 13:24.333
and there was
no new information,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.633
and you were living together.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.433
Well, because I wasn't
sure of how he'd respond

13:27.500 --> 13:30.133
to the situation
after the custody with--

13:30.200 --> 13:32.633
Listen, I understand exactly
what happened

13:32.700 --> 13:35.266
because part of the lawsuit
is your mother's lawsuit

13:35.333 --> 13:37.033
because she laid out
5,000 dollars

13:37.100 --> 13:38.967
for a lawyer,
and you're suing him

13:39.033 --> 13:41.100
for filing a false
restraining order.

13:41.166 --> 13:44.266
[dramatic music]

13:44.333 --> 13:46.033
Listen to me carefully.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.567
You know how fair I am.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.567
I'm the fairest person
you know in your life.

13:49.633 --> 13:50.567
[laughs]

13:50.633 --> 13:53.533
Don't look at the wall,
don't look at your friend,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.367
Whitney or Sarah.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.100
Look here.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.533
What did you throw
in the dumpster?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.900
[dramatic music]

14:12.066 --> 14:13.467
[narrator]
<i>Jasmine Muhammad-Bishop</i>

14:13.533 --> 14:16.667
<i>has accused ex-boyfriend,</i>
<i>Angel Casteneda,</i>

14:16.734 --> 14:18.400
<i>of throwing away</i>
<i>her property</i>

14:18.467 --> 14:21.333
<i>and filing false charges</i>
<i>against Jasmine.</i>

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
[Judy] Now, you're suing him

14:22.467 --> 14:24.266
for filing a false
restraining order.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.667
I don't know
whether he did or not.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.967
Certainly,
the police were called,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.300
and there were
two different versions.

14:28.367 --> 14:32.700
I do know this, however,
that between the 7th of July

14:32.767 --> 14:35.066
when he got his temporary
restraining order,

14:35.133 --> 14:38.033
and according to you,
the 22nd of July

14:38.100 --> 14:39.800
when you were
due back in court,

14:39.867 --> 14:44.200
you didn't file a police report
alleging any problem with him.

14:44.266 --> 14:46.700
Everything was quiet.
You got a lawyer.

14:46.767 --> 14:49.700
Your lawyer told you to stay
home, not come to court

14:49.767 --> 14:52.200
because you were going to file
a restraining order against him

14:52.266 --> 14:54.633
as part of a wider
custody dispute

14:54.700 --> 14:58.000
which ultimately ended
in an order of joint custody.

14:58.066 --> 15:00.567
Those are the bare facts.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.800
So, so far, he owes you
230 dollars

15:03.867 --> 15:06.066
for a router,
which I think he still has.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.800
However, sir,
in one of the police reports,

15:09.867 --> 15:14.266
it suggests that you threw
some of her stuff in a dumpster.

15:14.333 --> 15:18.467
Listen to me carefully.
You know how fair I am.

15:18.533 --> 15:19.967
I'm the fairest person
you know in your life.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.100
[audience laughs]

15:21.166 --> 15:24.200
Don't look at the wall.
Don't look at your friend,

15:24.266 --> 15:25.467
Whitney or Sarah.

15:26.233 --> 15:30.200
Look here. What did you
throw in the dumpster?

15:30.266 --> 15:31.834
I didn't throw anything
in the dumpster.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.100
I don't believe that.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.066
[laughs]

15:35.133 --> 15:37.033
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.033
What did you throw
in the dumpster?

15:39.100 --> 15:42.066
Did you throw any of her clothes
in the dumpster?

15:42.133 --> 15:45.834
I believe her clothes
were by the dumpster.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.767
But I didn't throw
any of it away.

15:47.834 --> 15:51.934
So, somebody placed
her clothes near the dumpster?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.467
Correct.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.600
What did you place
near the dumpster?

15:55.667 --> 15:59.367
I put all her stuff.
All her shoes, electronics.

15:59.433 --> 16:03.667
Well, for shoes, you know,
women really like their shoes.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.300
And all of her electronics.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.533
What electronics did you put

16:06.600 --> 16:07.533
-near the dumpster?
-[Angel] I don't know--

16:07.600 --> 16:08.433
What?

16:08.500 --> 16:09.934
It had to have been the

16:10.000 --> 16:11.567
had to have been
the router was there too,

16:11.633 --> 16:13.567
because I can't-- There's no use
of the router for me.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.967
If you don't pay that month,
you know, it's out of service.

16:16.033 --> 16:18.100
From what I can recall,
it was a lot of,

16:18.166 --> 16:21.367
just like shoes, clothes,
just bundles of clothes

16:21.433 --> 16:22.500
where I put 'em in bags.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.867
And I just put 'em right there,

16:23.934 --> 16:25.333
so she can pick 'em up,
you know.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.533
Do you recall
on what date you did that?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.467
Now, your son was living
with you at the time?

16:30.533 --> 16:31.500
Correct.

16:31.567 --> 16:32.633
It had to have been
the day it happened,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.667
it was the-the day
of the incident.

16:34.734 --> 16:36.734
And what date was that?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.800
[Angel] The 27th,

16:38.867 --> 16:42.967
27th or 22nd
of that month. June.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.133
-[Judy] Six-22.
-Correct.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.767
How much did you pay the lawyer
to represent your daughter?

16:48.834 --> 16:50.066
Fifty-two hundred dollars.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.867
[Judy] You're not
getting that back.

16:51.934 --> 16:54.667
I don't know whether
the allegations are true or not.

16:54.734 --> 16:57.033
As far as the order
of protection is concerned,

16:57.100 --> 17:01.400
I can tell you that the one
that your daughter filed

17:01.467 --> 17:03.800
had no basis because,
according to her,

17:03.867 --> 17:07.033
nothing happened,
certainly between June,

17:07.100 --> 17:12.300
more clearly from July 7th when
he got the protective order

17:12.367 --> 17:16.300
until the 22nd of July
when she was due back in court.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.367
And the lawyer told her
not to appear.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.400
That's not actually
how it occurred. I'm sorry.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.767
Well, that's
what she says.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.633
She says nothing happened.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.433
-No, nothing did happen.
-And there was no police report

17:27.500 --> 17:30.667
of anything that happened
between July the 7th--

17:30.734 --> 17:32.033
That's not why
she didn't appear in court.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.333
Well, that's why she says
she didn't appear in court.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.633
She said she didn't
appear in court,

17:35.700 --> 17:37.567
because she was going to file
her own order of protection.

17:37.633 --> 17:40.333
Would you read that back?
Would you read that back to me?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.033
She said, "because
I also wanted to file

17:43.100 --> 17:45.667
a restraining order
against Angel."

17:45.734 --> 17:47.700
That's why she says
she didn't appear in court.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.266
Correct.
Um, our attorney we retained

17:50.333 --> 17:53.400
at the time of July 22nd
had a trial already.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.867
So, he went and told Jasmine
to stay,

17:55.934 --> 17:57.567
that he appeared
at the trial for--

17:57.633 --> 17:59.033
Just a second.
You can't tell me

17:59.100 --> 18:01.333
any of that
because that's all hearsay.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.700
That's all hearsay.

18:02.767 --> 18:03.767
Okay.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.433
[Judy]
What the attorney told you,

18:05.500 --> 18:06.900
that's all hearsay, nonsense.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.834
The reason your daughter
didn't show up

18:08.900 --> 18:11.266
was because she said
she wanted to file

18:11.333 --> 18:13.333
her own order of protection
against him

18:13.400 --> 18:14.934
for things that happened
in the past.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.767
That's what she said.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.367
-Okay.
-[Judy] That she can tell me.

18:18.433 --> 18:21.667
Okay, so I have to use
a calculator here

18:21.734 --> 18:24.467
because I'm sure
you don't have-- What?

18:24.533 --> 18:25.934
I just want to clarify,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.500
that is what the attorney
did say as well.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.600
Did you understand
what I said?

18:30.667 --> 18:32.500
I said that's hearsay.

18:32.567 --> 18:36.734
What you answered me as to why
you didn't appear in court is,

18:36.800 --> 18:39.333
you said [laughs]
"because I wanted to file

18:39.400 --> 18:41.133
an order of protection
against him."

18:41.200 --> 18:42.333
That's what you said.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.867
Okay. Your lawsuit is claiming--

18:44.934 --> 18:48.200
Sarah Rose, check my info
on this, please,

18:48.266 --> 18:49.900
I don't even know how to
turn this thing on.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.166
All right, there, it's on.

18:51.233 --> 18:57.200
Lawsuit is alleging
6,574 dollars.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.934
And you paid the lawyer
how much?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.367
Uh, 5,200.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.000
-Fifty-two hundred.
-Mm-mm.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.700
[Judy] Minus 5,200 dollars.

19:04.767 --> 19:09.400
That means that there were
1,300 dollars, 1,374.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.567
And, sir, listen to me
carefully.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.166
According to what
you newly remember,

19:16.233 --> 19:18.300
you did in fact
stuff all of her stuff,

19:18.367 --> 19:20.433
including electronics,
in trash bags

19:20.500 --> 19:22.433
and put them out
near the dumpster

19:22.500 --> 19:25.200
on the day of this incident.
You can't do that.

19:25.266 --> 19:27.066
She's not going to get
her council fees,

19:27.133 --> 19:28.600
and she probably
doesn't have the receipts

19:28.667 --> 19:31.533
for all of this stuff,
but it sounds reasonable.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.633
You threw away
all of her shoes,

19:32.700 --> 19:33.834
that's 1,300 dollars.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.767
Thirteen seventy-four,
judgment for the plaintiff.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.533
-We're finished.
-[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.867
[dramatic music]

19:40.934 --> 19:42.500
It wasn't
that she cheated, right,

19:42.567 --> 19:44.300
she, because she didn't
want him, he don't know.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.467
As soon as she had birth,
she did not want him.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.934
The allegations
are completely false.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.333
I did not grab a knife.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.967
Well, she told me
I couldn't see my son

19:51.033 --> 19:52.033
without her,

19:52.100 --> 19:54.133
and she wasn't trying to do
the co-parent thing, so I mean--

19:54.200 --> 19:55.367
His way
of getting to me

19:55.433 --> 19:58.133
was trying to take me away
from my son.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.200
I hope she could just learn to co-parent

19:59.266 --> 20:01.934
and take that same
positive class

20:02.000 --> 20:03.400
"Parents By Choice" class
that I'm taking.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.100
If she can take that class,
I would be happy.

20:05.166 --> 20:08.467
All I hope for is just
for us to be on neutral terms,

20:08.533 --> 20:10.400
and do what's best for our son.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.934
[Judy] You know,
it's frustrating for me.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.066
You would think that people
learn from historical mistakes.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.800
And it was always my experience
in the family court

20:19.867 --> 20:23.667
that the people who ended up
with the short end of the stick,

20:23.734 --> 20:26.333
with other people's
irresponsible behavior,

20:26.400 --> 20:30.567
are children,
and very often, grandmothers.

20:30.633 --> 20:33.467
I mean, this young woman
is clearly responsible.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.367
She works, she has a job.

20:35.433 --> 20:39.300
She will have, shortly,
two children,

20:39.367 --> 20:40.767
both born out of wedlock,

20:40.834 --> 20:43.867
with two different fathers,
all within a two-year period,

20:43.934 --> 20:46.133
who doesn't live with
either of the fathers.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.266
The defendant in this case,

20:48.333 --> 20:51.433
it looked like he needed
a nap or a drug test.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.633
I'm not sure, maybe both.

20:53.700 --> 20:57.000
And the one that gets
holding the babies

20:57.066 --> 20:58.700
and holding the bag
is her mother.

20:58.767 --> 20:59.700
And paying the bills.

20:59.767 --> 21:00.834
And paying the bills.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.233
Anyway, I feel sorry
for those children.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.300
I hope she's a nice lady,

21:05.367 --> 21:08.266
because they're going to need
some direction.
