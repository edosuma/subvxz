... zap her arse.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.770
No matter what you hear,
you stay in bed.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.200
But there is one way your little boy
gets to keep his mum.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.520
I'll do anything.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.840
I'm Harry.

00:29.450 --> 00:32.100

It's OK!

00:42.080 --> 00:44.270
We need some help here, please!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.440
I was wrong about him.

00:46.470 --> 00:49.670
He really cares about you.
This whole seeing the future thing...

00:49.700 --> 00:51.470
It's messing with my head.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.040
- What you going to do?
- I have to go away.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.200
Somewhere they can't find me.

00:56.270 --> 00:59.050
I'm a hand grenade.
Some prick's about to pull the pin.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.580
Guess we better pack our bikinis.

01:02.060 --> 01:03.640
We're going to the seaside.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.840
I saw what she can do.
It scares her.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.940
She's the gateway to hell.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.170

I'm getting on a plane,

02:17.120 --> 02:18.680
and I'm hitting the beach.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.370
So! Big day.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.240
- How are we feeling?
- Yeah. OK.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.040
Well, try to contain
your excitement.

What's wrong with you,
you miserable bastard?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.280
What happens to Raquel?

02:34.170 --> 02:35.960
You know, after...

02:35.980 --> 02:39.220
I really don't see there's anything to
be gained from keeping her around.

02:39.370 --> 02:41.830
Well, I imagine she'll be
more than a little annoyed.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.570
Well, we're banking on it.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.880
Well, her being hurt an angry

02:45.930 --> 02:47.759
is what's going
to make those gates

02:47.760 --> 02:49.440
swing wide open,

02:49.470 --> 02:51.520
like a hooker's cooch.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.390
You, eh...

02:56.890 --> 02:58.920
You ever heard of
Stockholm Syndrome?

03:00.950 --> 03:03.760
It's a psychological condition

03:03.880 --> 03:06.580
where captives develop
feelings of affection

03:06.600 --> 03:08.320
towards their kidnappers.

03:08.470 --> 03:11.520
Instead of trying to escape,
they start whipping up pancakes

03:11.610 --> 03:13.780
and other labour-intensive
comfort foods.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.270
You like her, don't you?

03:19.470 --> 03:22.300
It's OK. It's always a risk.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.770
It just happened.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.540
You need to keep
a little bottle of her tears

03:28.840 --> 03:31.360
and drink from it
on special occasions.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.070
OK. I've got a million

04:39.140 --> 04:41.120
Why did Coldplay have to come?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.940
He's like a leech
on my dick, just

04:42.970 --> 04:45.050
sucking the joy out
of everything he touches.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.600
They could have
used him against Raquel.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.060
If he loves his sister,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.330
maybe that's a sacrifice
he should be willing to make.

04:50.770 --> 04:53.180
- I'd do it for my sister.
- You hate your sister.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.040
Uhh, she is poison.

05:01.190 --> 05:03.720
It's Harry.
He stopped breathing.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.620
But they revived him.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.170
He's asking for me.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.260
You can't go back.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.490
- It's too dangerous.
- He nearly died.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.000
I know how you feel about him,
but he's just one person.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.230
He saved my life.
You want me to ignore him?

05:19.790 --> 05:21.930
tens of thousands of people
get possessed.

what I should do?

planning on stopping me, Goldilocks?
