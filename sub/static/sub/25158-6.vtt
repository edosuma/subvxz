00:00.031 --> 00:02.068
<i>Previously on "Dietland"...</i>

00:02.078 --> 00:03.344
What do you want from me?

00:03.346 --> 00:06.881
The names and e-mail addresses
of Kitty's girls.

00:06.883 --> 00:10.251
- What's happening?
- I have to bounce for a while,

00:10.253 --> 00:11.352
maybe forever.

00:11.354 --> 00:13.288
But you went out of your way
to convince me

00:13.290 --> 00:16.224
that you were something other
than what you are. You're fired.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.560
This isn't gonna work out.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.962
Y-You're not what I expected.

00:22.132 --> 00:24.332
Since I'm fat, I should be desperate?

00:24.334 --> 00:26.401
Aaaaaaaah!

00:29.072 --> 00:30.362
I'm ready.

00:30.517 --> 00:34.066
<i> When things started happening
in my life, they happened so fast.</i>

00:34.076 --> 00:36.085
<i>I had turned myself in
to Calliope House,</i>

00:36.095 --> 00:38.148
<i>so I barely even noticed this...</i>

00:38.158 --> 00:39.657
<i>Leeta was on the run.</i>

00:43.897 --> 00:45.688
<i>Suspect is circling back.</i>

00:45.698 --> 00:47.724
<i>We're now heading west on Warner.</i>

00:47.734 --> 00:50.193
<i>Slow your vehicle and pull over! Now!</i>

00:59.779 --> 01:01.438
Stay up on her. Stay up on her.

01:01.448 --> 01:03.573
<i>We're heading west toward the protest.</i>

01:03.583 --> 01:05.608
<i>Try to clear the area.</i>

01:07.220 --> 01:09.212
<i>Got her right here. Right here.</i>

01:10.790 --> 01:13.216
It's her It's White Girl O.J.

01:13.226 --> 01:14.517
Go, Leeta!

01:30.410 --> 01:32.368
I'm gonna walk you through this!

01:32.378 --> 01:34.270
Open the door

01:34.280 --> 01:37.607
and <i> slowly</i> get out of the vehicle

01:37.617 --> 01:39.650
with your hands above your head!

01:41.054 --> 01:42.987
Do it!

01:56.169 --> 01:58.569
That's not her. That's not Leeta!

02:01.241 --> 02:03.333
Screw the patriarchy in the ass!

02:06.813 --> 02:08.505
Hi, Mom!

02:08.514 --> 02:11.841
<i>I'm gonna be a little late tonight.</i>

02:11.851 --> 02:13.525
It spanned three boroughs

02:13.535 --> 02:16.467
and brought morning rush hour
traffic to a standstill.

02:16.477 --> 02:19.182
<i>The chase began
at about eight this morning,</i>

02:19.192 --> 02:22.076
<i>when police were tipped off as
a woman believed to be Leeta...</i>

02:22.087 --> 02:24.208
Can someone please
turn this garbage off?

02:24.219 --> 02:26.161
<i>main suspect wanted for the
murder of Stella Cross...</i>

02:26.172 --> 02:28.331
Having that terrorist
associated with Austen Media?

02:28.342 --> 02:30.801
- It's unacceptable.
- I've screwed a few Jennifers.

02:30.803 --> 02:33.029
- Does that put me in their crosshairs?
- Unlikely.

02:33.039 --> 02:35.265
What I do know is that whoever this is,

02:35.275 --> 02:38.041
- they're running a stealth operation.
- You think it's the Russians?

02:38.052 --> 02:39.596
This is the kind of crap
that they live for.

02:39.607 --> 02:41.804
What we're asking, Agent, is,

02:41.814 --> 02:44.374
if you're feeling in the weeds here,

02:44.384 --> 02:47.944
I think we're prepared to step
in, bring in our own people?

02:47.954 --> 02:50.177
Every time you fellas take
matters into your own hands,

02:50.188 --> 02:53.016
- it complicates things.
- Makes you look bad, you mean.

02:53.026 --> 02:55.885
Look, we're all on the same team here.

02:55.895 --> 02:57.887
We all want the bad people caught.

02:57.897 --> 02:59.689
And I understand your concerns.

02:59.699 --> 03:00.998
I don't think you do.

03:03.503 --> 03:06.896
If someone drops you from a plane...

03:06.906 --> 03:09.032
who gives a shit?

03:09.042 --> 03:11.668
But if one of us gets killed,
the Dow tanks.

03:11.678 --> 03:13.978
Are you with me, Agent?

03:25.525 --> 03:26.757
Hello?

03:53.786 --> 03:55.511
Leeta.

03:55.521 --> 03:57.013
Hey, Plum.

03:57.023 --> 04:00.383
Um, I need your help. Can I come in?

04:00.393 --> 04:02.059
Why are the police here?

04:03.463 --> 04:07.098
PLUM, I SAID: Let me in.

04:08.368 --> 04:10.526
Plum, let me in.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.272
Kill her.

04:56.888 --> 04:57.998
Hello?

04:58.208 --> 05:00.283
<i>There are you, sleepyhead.</i>

05:00.294 --> 05:02.679
<i>You ready to come out now, honey?</i>

05:02.689 --> 05:04.080
Barb?

05:04.090 --> 05:06.649
<i>How ya feelin' today?</i>

05:06.659 --> 05:09.318
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm a little creeped out.

05:09.328 --> 05:11.208
<i>Roger that.</i>

05:11.219 --> 05:14.322
<i>The night before, I
didn't care what happened to me.</i>

05:14.333 --> 05:15.891
<i>But waking up in a locked room,</i>

05:15.901 --> 05:17.593
<i>knowing Verena had the key...</i>

05:17.603 --> 05:20.195
<i>maybe I should have cared a little more.</i>

06:02.002 --> 06:03.493
It's OK to stare.

06:03.503 --> 06:05.056
I'm sorry.

06:05.067 --> 06:07.693
You don't have to be sorry.
It's natural.

06:07.853 --> 06:09.686
I brought you a change of clothes.

06:13.159 --> 06:16.385
I don't remember much from last night.

06:16.395 --> 06:18.495
Everything's really fuzzy.

06:20.866 --> 06:24.693
Verena gave you something to help
you sleep. You were really upset.

06:24.703 --> 06:27.129
Where's Verena?
I want to talk to Verena.

06:27.139 --> 06:28.831
She'll be here as soon as she can.

06:28.841 --> 06:30.499
What happens until then?

06:30.509 --> 06:32.234
- Y-You lock me up again?
- No.

06:32.244 --> 06:34.403
These quiet rooms are for reflection.

06:34.413 --> 06:36.747
You're free to leave if you want to.

06:39.852 --> 06:41.251
<i>- I get so hard...
- fatass!</i>

06:58.838 --> 07:00.370
Excuse me. Julia Smith?

07:02.041 --> 07:03.599
We haven't met.

07:03.609 --> 07:06.936
We spoke a couple times on the phone.

07:06.946 --> 07:09.605
Right, right. The hot PI.

07:09.615 --> 07:12.942
Sorry, at Austen all we
talk about is hotness.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.743
It's our <i> raison d'Ãªtre.</i>

07:14.753 --> 07:17.213
I'm a... I'm a little late.

07:17.223 --> 07:20.082
It's OK, I'll walk with ya.

07:20.092 --> 07:23.686
I thought PI's only lurked
around buildings in the movies.

07:23.696 --> 07:26.288
So not creepy, by the way.

07:26.298 --> 07:29.458
This Leeta news. That must be hard, huh?

07:29.468 --> 07:31.927
You two were close?

07:31.937 --> 07:36.932
If by that you mean I sent her to get
my tampons when I ran out, sure.

07:36.942 --> 07:39.435
It's unfortunate, it really is.
What can I say?

07:39.445 --> 07:42.071
She's done a terrible thing
that could ruin her life.

07:42.081 --> 07:44.306
Right. Aren't you at least curious?

07:44.316 --> 07:47.142
How does a 23-year-old
with a squeaky clean record

07:47.152 --> 07:49.912
all of a sudden end up
on the FBI's Most Wanted?

07:49.922 --> 07:52.581
Stay in school, don't do drugs.

07:52.591 --> 07:55.885
Leeta was in school. She graduated
with a minor in Women's Studies.

07:55.895 --> 07:59.955
I guess it didn't stick. She was obsessed
with getting the perfect red lip.

07:59.965 --> 08:01.601
Can I tell you something?

08:01.612 --> 08:05.060
Kitty hired me because she thinks that
there might be a traitor at Austen.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.495
Besides Leeta.

08:07.205 --> 08:09.039
Who can she trust?

08:09.050 --> 08:10.716
That's the issue.

08:12.227 --> 08:14.052
I'm sorry.

08:14.062 --> 08:16.488
- It's been a rough few weeks.
- Yeah.

08:16.498 --> 08:17.990
It has.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.325
So what are you asking? Really.

08:20.335 --> 08:22.828
So Leeta's part of Jennifer, right?

08:22.838 --> 08:25.564
If those leaks did come
from inside Austen,

08:25.574 --> 08:28.600
now, that means that threat is not gone.

08:28.610 --> 08:31.778
Would you have any idea
who Leeta's allies were?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.943
Not that I can think of,

08:37.953 --> 08:40.578
but I'll think about it
and let you know.

08:40.589 --> 08:43.448
Well, maybe I schedule a time,
come by the beauty closet,

08:43.457 --> 08:45.692
- really pick your brain?
- Sure, sure.

08:46.695 --> 08:49.021
Great.

08:49.031 --> 08:51.089
I really do have to get going.

08:51.099 --> 08:52.991
Yeah, no problem.
You go. I'll be in touch.

08:53.001 --> 08:54.860
OK, whatever you need.

08:54.870 --> 08:56.161
Have a good day at work!

08:56.171 --> 08:57.938
You too, sweetheart!

09:17.125 --> 09:20.852
- Here ya go, baby boy.
- You got a minute?

09:20.862 --> 09:22.988
re.

09:22.998 --> 09:24.564
What can I do for you, Detective?

09:25.867 --> 09:27.334
Have you heard from Plum?

09:29.471 --> 09:31.496
She's not answering her phone, and...

09:31.506 --> 09:33.699
Yeah, we talked a little bit last night.

09:33.709 --> 09:34.866
She's a little rattled.

09:34.876 --> 09:38.003
Yeah. Yeah.

09:38.013 --> 09:39.638
I mean, things have been crazy.

09:39.648 --> 09:42.007
Right? First Kitty fires her,

09:42.017 --> 09:44.584
then Leeta turns out
to be one of those psychos.

09:45.654 --> 09:47.387
Listen, um...

09:50.058 --> 09:54.152
what have you heard
on the force about Jennifer?

09:54.162 --> 09:56.855
Can I get two coffees here, please?

09:56.865 --> 09:59.524
Nothin' certain. I mean,

09:59.534 --> 10:01.727
network's pretty deep,

10:01.737 --> 10:04.062
the fact they've gotten this far
without gettin' caught.

10:04.072 --> 10:07.199
Could be the tip of the iceberg
in terms of what to expect.

10:07.209 --> 10:08.867
Jesus.

10:08.877 --> 10:12.237
It's a shitty time to be you, huh?

10:12.247 --> 10:14.773
Nobody's dropping me
from a plane, but you...?

10:14.783 --> 10:16.575
Yeah, I'm the man, I guess.

10:16.585 --> 10:18.777
That tide's been turning for a while.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.679
Must be hard.

10:20.689 --> 10:24.583
Feeling like you're being judged
simply because of how you look.

10:24.593 --> 10:26.226
Thanks for your understanding.

10:27.929 --> 10:29.087
I'm goin' on break.

10:29.097 --> 10:31.398
Ten more minutes. Please?

10:33.535 --> 10:36.028
OK, look, it would be good

10:36.038 --> 10:38.063
if I can get in touch
with her, that's all.

10:38.073 --> 10:42.142
Is this business or a personal interest?

10:43.979 --> 10:45.779
It's both, I guess.

10:49.418 --> 10:52.120
You know, she would hate
me for telling you this.

10:52.131 --> 10:53.172
What?

10:53.183 --> 10:54.946
Plum has had experience with men.

10:54.956 --> 10:57.783
Well, man. <i>A</i> man.

10:57.793 --> 11:00.218
But not the <i> full</i> experience.

11:00.228 --> 11:02.421
Look, it happens.

11:02.431 --> 11:05.991
People like her, or, say, a gay
black man from a religious family?

11:06.001 --> 11:09.561
We get screwed up about sex.

11:09.571 --> 11:11.071
Just don't assume anything.

11:12.741 --> 11:14.666
She's the smartest person I know

11:14.676 --> 11:17.235
wrapped around a 14-year-old
girl who doesn't know shit.

11:17.245 --> 11:19.112
- Yeah, I'm just...
- You understand?

11:21.817 --> 11:23.809
I have a little bit of a bad feeling,

11:23.819 --> 11:25.844
and I just want to make sure she's OK.

11:25.854 --> 11:29.514
She did say she was going off
the grid for a few days.

11:29.524 --> 11:32.084
Regroup. At Calliope House.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.352
But don't worry. These
women'll take care of her.

11:34.362 --> 11:38.164
They're like her hippie
fairy godmothers.

11:57.052 --> 11:59.052
Not yet, Plum.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.690
What is that place?

12:05.627 --> 12:07.986
It's hd to describe.

12:07.996 --> 12:10.497
When you're ready, you'll experience it.

12:12.801 --> 12:15.627
- What if I don't want to experience it?
- Then you won't.

12:15.637 --> 12:19.564
Nothing happens here without your consent.
I hope that's clear.

12:19.574 --> 12:22.868
The line between what's clear
and what's really screwed up

12:22.878 --> 12:25.971
is getting... hard to tell.

12:25.981 --> 12:29.574
Since I met you, I got waxed, injected,

12:29.584 --> 12:31.176
lost my job,

12:31.186 --> 12:33.845
got punched, humiliated...

12:33.855 --> 12:35.413
it's been awesome.

12:35.423 --> 12:37.423
- Good.
- Good?

12:38.994 --> 12:41.052
Did you hear what I...

12:41.062 --> 12:44.256
What was that?
You wanted to say something.

12:44.266 --> 12:46.366
Not really.

12:48.170 --> 12:50.395
I've never been in therapy,
but I know a lot about it.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.898
Oh, yeah? How, by reading about it?

12:52.908 --> 12:55.500
By being alive in the 21st century.

12:55.510 --> 12:59.838
I know that you want me
to get in touch with my anger.

12:59.848 --> 13:03.675
You want me to release it.
Let it all out.

13:03.685 --> 13:05.610
Like that'll fix me.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.345
It won't.

13:07.355 --> 13:09.022
Not even close.

13:10.425 --> 13:12.717
Anger is not a finite thing...

13:12.727 --> 13:15.061
it can't be expunged
with one good airing.

13:16.398 --> 13:18.464
But it can be directed.

13:19.601 --> 13:21.534
You can give it a voice.

13:23.205 --> 13:25.030
That makes it bearable.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.399
Bearable.

13:27.409 --> 13:29.100
That's comforting.

13:29.110 --> 13:31.069
What about the New Baptist
Plan makes you think

13:31.079 --> 13:32.437
I'm interested in your comfort?

13:32.447 --> 13:33.972
What?

13:33.982 --> 13:37.409
What makes you think
I am interested in your comfort?

13:37.419 --> 13:39.711
I heard what you said.
I'm not sure what you mean.

13:39.721 --> 13:42.814
You don't need to be sure.
Just... think about it.

13:42.824 --> 13:46.084
That's the final phase
of your work here:

13:46.094 --> 13:50.563
thinking about everything you've gone
through recently, what it means to you.

13:53.001 --> 13:55.301
That's all you need to do.

14:01.509 --> 14:04.258
Wait. That's it? We're done here?

14:04.269 --> 14:07.972
I know. On TV
it's always a 50-minute hour

14:07.983 --> 14:11.017
and time is always up right
before the big breakthrough.

14:23.342 --> 14:26.599
How much did I pay Tom
to decorate this office?

14:26.610 --> 14:30.606
And now some teenager is gonna
take my job and, I don't know,

14:30.616 --> 14:34.110
Pinterest some hideous office from 2002

14:34.120 --> 14:36.453
and destroy a work of art.

14:37.657 --> 14:39.281
Go get me a pastrami sandwich,

14:39.291 --> 14:40.783
fries and a Coke.

14:40.793 --> 14:42.359
Regular, not that diet garbage.

14:43.829 --> 14:45.788
Tell them it's for you.

14:46.688 --> 14:49.756
I'm gonna need you to sit
in here while I eat it.

14:53.205 --> 14:55.965
Diptyque has a new skin care line.

14:59.178 --> 15:01.979
- Did you read the press release?
- I did.

15:03.382 --> 15:05.608
I thought it was very tasteful.

15:05.618 --> 15:07.343
Senior VP sounds legit.

15:07.353 --> 15:09.053
No, it doesn't. I should have quit.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.282
Inhale.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.153
It'll pass. He'll reinstate you.

15:17.163 --> 15:19.455
- Is that ylang-ylang?
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.465 --> 15:20.798
Do it again.

15:25.204 --> 15:28.138
Jesus! That's his third call.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.801
He thinks I'm involved.

15:31.811 --> 15:33.169
With Jennifer.

15:33.179 --> 15:34.645
Why would he think that?

15:37.850 --> 15:39.909
Because of Leeta.

15:39.919 --> 15:42.186
What did you do, Julia?

15:44.023 --> 15:46.916
Well, I don't know if...

15:46.926 --> 15:49.719
I don't think that she's <i> killed</i> anyone,

15:49.729 --> 15:54.190
but, uh, Leeta was the one
who stole the email files.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.025
The Kitty Girls.

15:56.035 --> 15:58.394
The personal stuff.

15:58.404 --> 16:00.663
And I covered for her.

16:00.673 --> 16:02.506
Jesus!

16:03.876 --> 16:06.168
And now I think maybe, well,

16:06.178 --> 16:09.171
she's probably responsible
for the other hack too.

16:09.181 --> 16:11.941
I am <i> so sorry,</i> Kitty.

16:11.951 --> 16:14.376
She used me.

16:14.386 --> 16:18.414
We got... very close.

16:18.424 --> 16:20.416
I mean, she was so passionate

16:20.426 --> 16:22.685
and beautiful and messed up.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.386
I thought I was helping.

16:24.396 --> 16:26.130
But now...

16:27.733 --> 16:30.726
I-I had no idea she... she was...

16:30.736 --> 16:31.927
A terrorist.

16:31.937 --> 16:34.463
You were screwing a terrorist.

16:34.473 --> 16:37.700
You're so utterly blind
you may as well have a dick,

16:37.710 --> 16:39.576
you pathetic...

16:43.215 --> 16:44.907
Did she give it all to Jennifer?

16:44.917 --> 16:46.475
The addresses? All of it?

16:46.485 --> 16:48.444
Where is she now?

16:48.454 --> 16:50.613
No idea.

16:50.623 --> 16:52.748
What she did or where she is.

16:52.758 --> 16:54.950
I didn't fire her. She disappeared.

16:54.961 --> 16:56.986
But then since nothing
happened with the hack,

16:56.996 --> 16:59.555
I figured it was a coincidence.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.757
But Stella Cross.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.759
Then all of a sudden Leeta's wanted,

17:03.769 --> 17:05.594
and it's all just a bloody mess.

17:05.604 --> 17:06.770
And I own that.

17:07.839 --> 17:10.398
And I will speak to the FBI...

17:10.409 --> 17:13.102
and I'll resign.

17:13.112 --> 17:15.279
If that's what you want me to do.

17:22.621 --> 17:24.680
You're not gonna talk to the FBI.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.683
The only new information
is your crush on that girl.

17:27.693 --> 17:30.252
They're desperate. They
don't care about the truth.

17:30.262 --> 17:33.263
They'll crucify you,
Austen Media, and me.

17:37.436 --> 17:39.929
- And you're not resigning.
- Thank you.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.263
Thank you, Kitty.

17:41.273 --> 17:42.531
I'm firing you.

17:42.541 --> 17:44.441
Pack up your shit and get out.

17:52.218 --> 17:55.010
- They already deactivated your badge.
- Then please,

17:55.020 --> 17:57.479
escort me to the beauty closet
so I can gather my things!

17:57.489 --> 17:59.815
Company policy, your belongings

17:59.825 --> 18:02.184
will be messengered
to your home address.

18:02.194 --> 18:05.221
Allison, please. I'm calling
in every favor here.

18:05.231 --> 18:06.822
She can't do anything.

18:06.832 --> 18:08.557
Kitty changed the door code personally.

18:08.567 --> 18:09.725
No one has access.

18:09.735 --> 18:10.826
I don't know what you did,

18:10.836 --> 18:11.969
but let me help you.

18:15.241 --> 18:17.967
I wasn't bullshitting out there, Julia.
You're acting like...

18:17.977 --> 18:22.071
Can't you just call Kitty, tell her I'm
gone... she'll give you the new code.

18:22.081 --> 18:25.541
- What if she checks the security feed?
- She won't! Come on!

18:25.551 --> 18:28.886
I got you promoted out of the mail room.
You owe me!

18:30.422 --> 18:33.249
I need to get into the beauty closet.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.850
I have to clear up some loose ends.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.852
What kind of loose ends?

18:36.862 --> 18:38.854
The kind you don't want to know about.

18:38.864 --> 18:41.657
Just get in in there
and let me clear out properly.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.693
- We can't. If someone finds out...
- They won't!

18:44.703 --> 18:46.996
Jesus, have either of you any balls?!

18:47.006 --> 18:50.332
Or does the justice warrior
thing only work for you

18:50.342 --> 18:51.608
when there's no risk involved?

18:57.783 --> 18:59.909
Text me what you need taken care of,

18:59.919 --> 19:01.785
and I'll find a way.

19:03.022 --> 19:04.847
I'm a Puerto Rican homosexual

19:04.857 --> 19:06.515
who wears too much makeup.

19:06.525 --> 19:08.258
You know I've got balls for days.

19:17.870 --> 19:19.295
<i>Whatever it was,</i>

19:19.305 --> 19:22.398
<i>it had a pull like a tractor beam.</i>

19:22.408 --> 19:25.267
<i>I felt like it wanted me inside.</i>

19:25.277 --> 19:27.778
<i>Like I could disappear there
and never come out.</i>

19:29.615 --> 19:31.307
<i>I also knew Verena was right...</i>

19:31.317 --> 19:32.950
<i>I wasn't ready for it.</i>

19:39.291 --> 19:40.791
Cute.

20:00.012 --> 20:03.772
- Ah. Feeling any better?
- Not really.

20:03.782 --> 20:07.276
So, what's the deal with that room?

20:07.286 --> 20:09.311
Sounds like there's an orgy
or something in there.

20:09.321 --> 20:10.779
That's a project of Marlowe's.

20:12.157 --> 20:14.616
Should have realized.

20:14.626 --> 20:17.853
I've never met anyone who talks
about screwing as much as she does.

20:17.863 --> 20:20.155
She's an actress.

20:20.165 --> 20:22.958
Ha! Oh, don't make me laugh.

20:22.968 --> 20:24.468
It hurts.

20:27.139 --> 20:29.098
If everybody's doing their own thing,

20:29.108 --> 20:31.633
isn't it hard to actually
get anything done?

20:31.643 --> 20:33.202
How do you make an impact?

20:33.212 --> 20:35.604
Well, we say here,

20:35.614 --> 20:37.881
"You change the world
one person at a time."

20:39.485 --> 20:40.843
We share our dreams,

20:40.853 --> 20:43.879
and Verena challenges us
to realize them.

20:43.889 --> 20:46.390
What if your dreams are killing people?

20:47.893 --> 20:51.053
Maybe you should write
those questions down.

20:51.063 --> 20:52.521
Patience, Plum.

20:52.531 --> 20:54.390
You'll get your answers.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.492
Thank you, Captain Cryptic.

21:02.141 --> 21:04.307
Are these all you?

21:05.878 --> 21:07.177
They are.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.507
I'll tell you what happened to my face

21:11.517 --> 21:13.176
if you tell me what happened to yours.

21:17.556 --> 21:20.390
Some guy called me fat. Basically.

21:22.928 --> 21:25.220
I yelled at him.

21:25.230 --> 21:27.656
So you asked for it.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.367
Oh, I told you, don't make me laugh.

21:32.371 --> 21:33.837
Your turn.

21:36.408 --> 21:38.667
My mother tried to leave my father.

21:38.677 --> 21:42.004
So he threw acid on me. To punish her.

21:42.014 --> 21:44.273
Jesus. That's awful.

21:44.283 --> 21:47.876
- Sometimes I understand why.
- What?

21:47.886 --> 21:50.212
I understand why Leeta
wants to kill people.

21:50.222 --> 21:52.414
We don't know she did, Plum.
She's just a suspect.

21:52.424 --> 21:57.052
Well, whatever. Your dad
belongs on the top of the list.

21:57.062 --> 21:59.021
I used to feel that way.

21:59.031 --> 22:01.590
Verena helped me change that.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.959
She helped me find the gift
in what happened to me.

22:03.969 --> 22:06.728
Oh, no. Not one of <i> those.</i>

22:06.738 --> 22:09.031
So whenever something horrible happens,

22:09.041 --> 22:10.866
Verena's the type to say,

22:10.876 --> 22:13.469
"Well, you'll be stronger for it."

22:13.479 --> 22:17.272
Really? Like that's the only way
you could have learned something?

22:17.282 --> 22:19.641
Whatever gift or lesson you had,

22:19.651 --> 22:22.578
you couldn't have, like, I don't
know, read a book or something?

22:22.588 --> 22:26.456
You had to actually go through
whatever hideous thing?

22:27.493 --> 22:28.959
What?

22:33.232 --> 22:35.591
Do you want to hear
what I learned, or not?

22:35.601 --> 22:37.734
Yes. I'm sorry.

22:39.104 --> 22:41.597
The way people react to my face...

22:41.607 --> 22:44.166
it's like a truth serum.

22:44.176 --> 22:47.169
The essentially decent adjust,

22:47.179 --> 22:50.139
and those that don't, I know to avoid.

22:50.149 --> 22:51.607
How is that a gift?

22:51.617 --> 22:54.317
Doesn't that make you
hate the jerks more?

22:55.954 --> 22:58.680
Not anymore.

22:58.690 --> 23:02.425
They have to live with their ugliness.
I don't.

23:07.966 --> 23:09.599
I got it.

23:21.046 --> 23:22.512
Hey.

23:26.652 --> 23:28.485
Can I come in?

23:30.856 --> 23:32.522
Please.

23:33.859 --> 23:36.359
I don't know where else to go.

23:52.328 --> 23:55.221
<i>"They have to live with their ugliness.</i>

23:55.231 --> 23:56.655
<i>I don't."</i>

23:56.665 --> 23:59.191
<i>Get your eyes off the food, fatass!</i>

24:04.974 --> 24:08.200
<i>That philosophy works,
as long as you stay safe</i>

24:08.210 --> 24:10.035
<i>in the womb of Calliope House.</i>

24:10.045 --> 24:11.712
<i>Plum, you OK?</i>

24:13.682 --> 24:16.041
<i>But the real, hideous world</i>

24:16.051 --> 24:18.911
<i>wouldn't stop calling to me.</i>

24:21.724 --> 24:24.917
Careful, Plummy.

24:24.927 --> 24:26.051
Julia.

24:26.061 --> 24:28.521
It's rough in there.

24:28.531 --> 24:32.324
Jesus! Are you OK?

24:32.334 --> 24:34.034
What happened with Leeta?

24:35.738 --> 24:37.337
Can you...

24:38.674 --> 24:40.607
I...

24:43.445 --> 24:45.671
Wanna see a magic trick?

24:45.681 --> 24:47.915
Excuse me?

26:31.020 --> 26:32.486
Would you?

27:25.507 --> 27:27.040
Would you hand me that, lovely?

27:48.797 --> 27:51.031
I don't understand.

27:52.301 --> 27:54.193
Well...

27:54.203 --> 27:56.795
I've been going somewhat "incognegro."

27:56.805 --> 27:59.631
And I had a double mastectomy.

27:59.641 --> 28:01.400
I can see that.

28:01.410 --> 28:04.103
I'm sorry. About the mastectomy.

28:04.113 --> 28:05.938
Don't be.

28:05.948 --> 28:08.382
Two less things to worry about.

28:11.387 --> 28:14.246
So this was your disguise?

28:14.256 --> 28:15.988
To pass at Austen?

28:15.999 --> 28:19.480
Well, they're not in the habit
of hiring real people, so...

28:23.932 --> 28:25.899
What did you make Leeta do?

28:27.736 --> 28:30.062
Pretty Plummy.

28:30.072 --> 28:33.240
What did Leeta make <i> me</i> do,
is more the question.

28:35.844 --> 28:39.246
Right. She wanted you to have something.

28:41.417 --> 28:45.252
This is one of my favorite entries.

28:47.790 --> 28:50.916
"Plum thinks she's afraid
of other people's opinions.

28:50.926 --> 28:53.619
Their judgments. Their assumptions.

28:53.629 --> 28:56.155
Afraid of not being acceptable.

28:56.165 --> 28:58.524
But really, she's afraid of herself.

28:58.534 --> 29:00.826
She's afraid of what's inside.

29:00.836 --> 29:04.096
Because the minute she stops
caring about that shit,

29:04.106 --> 29:06.440
she's gonna be a beast.

29:09.111 --> 29:12.145
Her words are like fire."

29:16.385 --> 29:18.877
You should try micro-needling.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.113
Your crow's feet will thank you for it.

29:21.123 --> 29:23.482
I need to show you something.

29:23.492 --> 29:25.317
Give it to your wife, then.

29:25.327 --> 29:27.352
Come on, Kitty.

29:27.362 --> 29:31.023
What? I deserve a little me-time.

29:31.033 --> 29:33.792
I kinda like it down here without Julia.

29:33.802 --> 29:37.229
I can do as I please. Take what I like.

29:37.239 --> 29:39.039
No chatter.

29:43.245 --> 29:46.371
Well, it looks like a "before" photo.

29:46.381 --> 29:49.741
Before electricity. Antibiotics.
Who are they?

29:49.751 --> 29:53.579
This woman on the right,
she runs a collective, I guess?

29:53.589 --> 29:56.048
For abused women. Calliope House.

29:56.058 --> 29:58.750
- Leeta led Plum there.
- Oh, who cares about Plum?

29:58.760 --> 30:00.152
Or Leeta, for that matter.

30:00.162 --> 30:01.394
Julia explained everything.

30:02.898 --> 30:04.656
She wanted some pussy.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.992
Instead, she ate a bullet,
poor old thing.

30:07.002 --> 30:11.029
But I'm safe, and Austen Media
is out of the crosshairs.

30:11.039 --> 30:12.906
Are you gonna let me finish?

30:17.946 --> 30:19.671
Tell me who this woman is.

30:19.681 --> 30:22.374
Julia has a fat sister?

30:22.384 --> 30:25.043
I think that <i> is</i> Julia.

30:25.053 --> 30:28.614
Oh, my God. How? Why?

30:28.624 --> 30:30.782
Maybe she's not some lovesick lesbian.

30:30.792 --> 30:33.385
Think about it. She lied
to me about knowing Plum.

30:33.395 --> 30:35.721
What if... she's part of Jennifer?

30:35.731 --> 30:37.697
S... Stop.

30:41.737 --> 30:44.096
Do you know that
I've developed acid reflux?

30:44.106 --> 30:46.932
And the stress of this Jennifer thing

30:46.942 --> 30:50.202
has just thrown me over the top.

30:50.212 --> 30:53.572
I'm eating Tums like
a cheerleader gobbles cock.

30:53.582 --> 30:56.742
- I'm not sitting on this.
- What do you want, Dominic?

30:56.752 --> 30:59.243
You wanted to know who your
traitor was; we flushed her out.

30:59.254 --> 31:01.442
So the way I'm lookin' at it,
me and you are done here.

31:01.453 --> 31:04.983
Hmm... not necessarily.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.885
I prefer having you around.

31:06.895 --> 31:10.122
I have so few allies right now.

31:10.132 --> 31:13.091
- Yeah?
- And... you're useful.

31:13.101 --> 31:14.374
And I certainly don't want you

31:14.385 --> 31:16.241
handing that information
to Stanley or the FBI.

31:16.252 --> 31:18.186
You mean you don't want me
doing what's right.

31:19.675 --> 31:21.608
Who's to say what's right?

31:23.445 --> 31:26.838
You know, you really need to relax.

31:26.848 --> 31:31.276
You're actually... handsome
when you're not grimacing.

31:31.286 --> 31:35.255
I could help you... relax.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.351
I'm flattered...

31:39.361 --> 31:41.795
and I'm married.

31:43.432 --> 31:45.157
But not satisfied at home.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.326
Jesus, even talking about Plum
gives you a semi.

31:47.336 --> 31:49.528
Kitty.

31:49.538 --> 31:50.963
Touched a nerve, did I?

31:52.374 --> 31:54.507
Your nerves could use touching.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.812
All of them.

32:00.148 --> 32:03.141
Unhh.<i> God,</i> you're dull.

32:03.151 --> 32:05.944
Such a waste of a brute.

32:05.954 --> 32:08.847
Can't wait long.
People could be in danger.

32:08.857 --> 32:10.449
Fine, I'll get back to you.

32:10.459 --> 32:12.192
Don't do anything noble.

32:22.237 --> 32:25.731
The one good thing about
leaving Austen Media for good?

32:25.741 --> 32:28.200
Carbs.

32:28.210 --> 32:30.280
This body is not meant to be flat.

32:30.291 --> 32:34.178
Staying a size 8 takes every
compression garment known to man

32:34.189 --> 32:36.556
and every bit of self-control I have.

32:42.557 --> 32:44.983
You didn't tell anyone
about the emails, did you?

32:44.993 --> 32:47.819
Julia, you promised.

32:47.829 --> 32:50.355
We have conditions for my stay.

32:50.365 --> 32:53.392
I'm not allowed to discuss Austen Media,

32:53.402 --> 32:57.162
or anything related
to my... special projects.

32:57.172 --> 32:58.905
No Julia drama.

33:00.609 --> 33:02.534
Just this one question.

33:02.544 --> 33:04.077
Please.

33:05.247 --> 33:06.513
One.

33:09.184 --> 33:11.677
I never told anybody.

33:11.687 --> 33:15.047
Not Kitty, not... the detective.

33:15.057 --> 33:16.381
We were the only ones who knew.

33:16.391 --> 33:18.417
Oh, God, I'm afraid to ask.

33:18.427 --> 33:20.226
Excellent. Don't.

33:21.596 --> 33:24.531
Good job, Plummy. Thank you.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.395
Sweet Mary and Joseph.

33:30.405 --> 33:32.205
Do you know where Leeta is?

33:35.444 --> 33:37.069
That's her question.

33:37.079 --> 33:39.245
Is she alive? Can you answer me that?

33:41.416 --> 33:44.084
Thank you, O great and powerful one.

33:46.221 --> 33:48.613
I've spoken with her. She's safe.

33:48.623 --> 33:50.782
The less you know,
the better for everybody.

33:50.792 --> 33:52.084
That's enough.

33:52.094 --> 33:53.385
- Please?
- Fine.

33:53.395 --> 33:54.720
Fine.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.580
I love what you've done with the place.

33:56.591 --> 34:00.058
The basement? It's the same.
Nothing's changed.

34:00.068 --> 34:01.493
That's what I mean.

34:01.503 --> 34:04.137
Even Marlowe's crazy
art thing is still here.

34:05.607 --> 34:08.400
Some things remain constant.

34:08.409 --> 34:11.603
- It doesn't sound like art.
- You didn't tell her?

34:11.612 --> 34:14.172
We hadn't got that far.
It's a video installation.

34:14.181 --> 34:18.844
Livestreamed. The top 100 videos
on Porn Hub at any given moment.

34:18.853 --> 34:21.480
- Oh, wow.
- Delightful, huh?

34:21.489 --> 34:25.016
A real-time snapshot
of what's gettin' folks off.

34:25.025 --> 34:28.453
I bet there's a lot
of Stella Cross right now.

34:28.463 --> 34:32.031
People paying their final respects.

34:35.670 --> 34:39.464
Me, I'd rather have a video
of this cake. Ha ha!

34:44.846 --> 34:46.670
Umm.

34:46.681 --> 34:49.341
But my body is not used to butter.

34:49.351 --> 34:51.150
I think I'm gonna be sick.

34:54.656 --> 34:56.856
At what price beauty?

35:10.881 --> 35:14.208
<i>I was trying to quietly
reflect on Leeta's journal,</i>

35:14.219 --> 35:16.644
<i>like, that I would be a beast,</i>

35:16.654 --> 35:19.314
<i>that my words were like fire.</i>

35:21.826 --> 35:22.992
Knock knock.

35:24.295 --> 35:25.787
Ooh, it's so cold down here.

35:25.797 --> 35:27.322
Aren't you cold?

35:27.332 --> 35:30.633
It's not so bad. Got my own insulation.

35:34.539 --> 35:37.532
- I need to give you something.
- What is it?

35:37.542 --> 35:38.708
Scoot over.

35:43.581 --> 35:46.074
I'm freezing.

35:46.084 --> 35:48.409
Could you... Can you just...

35:48.419 --> 35:50.653
Can you just put your arms around me?

35:53.191 --> 35:55.216
Julia...

35:55.226 --> 35:58.853
I'm not gonna try anything. Promise.

35:58.863 --> 36:01.856
I know you don't "like me" like me.

36:01.866 --> 36:03.825
Come on.

36:03.835 --> 36:06.669
Mm. It's so much better.

36:10.441 --> 36:14.410
This is the book I've been
writing... on the beauty industry.

36:16.681 --> 36:19.440
Did you know cellulite was no big deal

36:19.450 --> 36:23.278
until a women's magazine
got a doctor to disease-ify it?

36:23.288 --> 36:26.514
Hell, babies have cellulite.

36:26.524 --> 36:28.783
Now people spend
a zillion dollars a year

36:28.793 --> 36:31.719
trying to cure
their sweet, dimpled thighs.

36:33.765 --> 36:36.132
Oh, you feel so good.

36:40.905 --> 36:43.231
If something happens to me,

36:43.241 --> 36:45.767
I want you to make sure
my book gets finished.

36:45.777 --> 36:48.269
What's gonna happen to you?

36:48.279 --> 36:50.371
Shh.

36:50.381 --> 36:53.208
If I can't, you finish it.

36:53.218 --> 36:55.310
But you put your name on it, too.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.111
No speakin' through someone else.

36:57.121 --> 36:58.254
Promise?

37:00.058 --> 37:02.925
I'm not... I can't write a book.

37:04.629 --> 37:06.654
Sure you can.

37:08.967 --> 37:11.559
Say you'll do it, beauty.

37:11.569 --> 37:13.169
Please?

37:16.241 --> 37:18.800
OK, but you have to answer

37:18.810 --> 37:20.602
one question for me.

37:20.612 --> 37:22.979
Straight. No evading.

37:27.452 --> 37:29.911
Deal.

37:29.921 --> 37:33.923
How did you go from writing
an exposÃ© to killing people?

37:39.764 --> 37:41.497
I didn't.

37:43.801 --> 37:46.602
You really are magnificent.

38:06.824 --> 38:09.117
I'm glad you wanted to talk.

38:09.127 --> 38:11.019
I just... I thought of something.

38:11.029 --> 38:13.121
It's... It's not a big deal.

38:13.131 --> 38:15.965
Well, I'll keep my expectations low.

38:19.737 --> 38:22.063
So Julia was cold,

38:22.073 --> 38:24.065
and she asked me to hold her

38:24.075 --> 38:25.800
so she could warm up.

38:25.810 --> 38:29.170
Well, she takes real
sensual pleasure in life.

38:29.180 --> 38:32.173
It's one of the things
I loved about her.

38:32.183 --> 38:34.475
So did you hold her?

38:34.485 --> 38:37.520
Yeah. I didn't want to at first.

38:38.556 --> 38:40.515
But...

38:40.525 --> 38:42.491
then...

38:44.095 --> 38:45.561
What?

38:47.598 --> 38:50.525
We were lying there, and I realized

38:50.535 --> 38:53.661
that I haven't been touched like that...

38:53.671 --> 38:58.107
or touched anyone like that, in years.

38:59.510 --> 39:01.569
How did it feel?

39:01.579 --> 39:04.339
So good!

39:04.349 --> 39:08.876
I mean, guess what? Basic human need!

39:08.886 --> 39:11.412
Hey, I got punched. I guess that
was getting touched, right?

39:11.422 --> 39:13.381
Yeah, you didn't want to
go into it last night.

39:13.391 --> 39:14.757
What happened?

39:17.095 --> 39:19.721
It was nothing. Wasn't a big deal.

39:19.731 --> 39:22.623
I bumped into this guy,
he said something rude.

39:22.633 --> 39:24.692
It was the way he looked at me.

39:26.070 --> 39:28.529
I'm so sick of being
looked at like that.

39:30.108 --> 39:33.401
- How did he look at you?
- Like I was pitiful!

39:33.411 --> 39:36.704
<i>Like everything that happened
between us was a lie.</i>

39:36.714 --> 39:39.374
Like a horrible mistake!

39:39.384 --> 39:44.954
When you say "with us," are we still
talking about the... man who hit you?

39:46.924 --> 39:50.284
I think I knew it wasn't real. Dominic.

39:50.294 --> 39:53.329
- He was just using me.
- Hmm.

39:54.799 --> 39:57.959
But it felt so nice for a change

39:57.969 --> 39:59.827
to have a story,

39:59.837 --> 40:03.664
to say, you know,
instead of "Nobody, nothing,"

40:03.674 --> 40:07.001
I could say, like,
"Hey, Ma, I met a boy."

40:07.011 --> 40:08.444
Ya know?

40:10.415 --> 40:13.074
I hate being like this!

40:13.084 --> 40:14.784
- How?
- Like <i> this.</i>

40:16.687 --> 40:19.280
What if it's not y that's the problem?

40:19.290 --> 40:22.191
What if it's everybody else
that needs to change?

40:23.861 --> 40:26.996
What if it's not you
that's wrong, it's them?

40:30.620 --> 40:32.375
Verena, I'm sorry to interrupt.

40:32.503 --> 40:34.829
There's someone here to see you.

40:34.839 --> 40:36.297
Tell them to come back?

40:36.307 --> 40:38.466
I said that. He's very insistent.

40:41.546 --> 40:42.621
It's OK.

40:42.632 --> 40:44.013
I'll make it fast.

41:14.974 --> 41:16.966
Hi, my name's Detective O'Shea...

41:16.976 --> 41:19.636
And you are no longer
in law enforcement.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.038
Plum was very upset last night,

41:22.048 --> 41:24.181
but I got the most important bits.

41:25.184 --> 41:27.310
I'd like to speak to her.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.979
In my experience,
the best way to apologize

41:29.989 --> 41:32.215
is to write the person a letter.

41:32.225 --> 41:34.050
On paper, preferably.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.852
That way he or she can read it

41:35.862 --> 41:38.521
when he or she is ready.

41:38.531 --> 41:40.890
Right. Or never.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.593
That should be the person's choice.

41:43.603 --> 41:46.504
Unless your real intention
is to make yourself feel better.

41:48.007 --> 41:51.200
You're not gonna charge me
300 bucks now, are ya?

41:51.210 --> 41:54.537
I'm very good at what I do, Mr. O'Shea.

41:54.547 --> 41:56.906
You know, I understood enough
from Plum last night

41:56.916 --> 41:59.776
to get what makes her
so appealing to you.

41:59.786 --> 42:02.946
She's like... an escape.

42:02.956 --> 42:07.892
She makes no demands, and she
sees you how you want to be seen.

42:09.095 --> 42:11.454
Or she did.

42:11.464 --> 42:13.456
That must hurt,

42:13.466 --> 42:15.866
because you failed her too.

42:17.904 --> 42:19.270
You... You done?

42:23.443 --> 42:26.736
And you're right, I didn't leave by choice.
But I didn't kill anybody.

42:26.746 --> 42:29.772
I don't like the way the world
works any better than you do,

42:29.782 --> 42:31.908
but somehow, everything is my fault.

42:31.918 --> 42:33.718
Not everything.

43:29.475 --> 43:31.634
How can you stand it?

43:31.644 --> 43:33.177
Helps me, actually.

43:34.647 --> 43:36.305
How?

43:36.315 --> 43:38.775
Look at their bodies.

43:38.785 --> 43:40.718
Their faces.

43:46.993 --> 43:49.393
Do they look like us?

43:51.864 --> 43:52.955
No.

43:52.965 --> 43:54.965
No.

43:56.135 --> 43:58.294
They're perfect.

43:58.304 --> 44:00.371
They're the precious ones.

44:05.878 --> 44:07.912
How's that working out for them?

44:33.873 --> 44:36.107
Fuck this.

45:07.707 --> 45:09.573
Look who's awake.
