WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:12.446
Number 18.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.082
Conine.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.817
I knew
that one.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.819
All right,
this one's for Mikey.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.154
Man:
Can I help you ?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.955
Can I have one
lemonade, please?

00:22.056 --> 00:23.591
You ready?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.226
Number six.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.728
- I know it.
- Sean, shush.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.397
David Segui?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.265
Sean:
Melvin Mora,
numbnuts.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.468
Michael:
I thought Mora
was number nine.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.770
Listen, guys,
we're gonna play
that spy game.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.038
Do you remember
the spy game?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.273
- Who's it?
- Yeah.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.175
That tall black guy
over there.

00:41.275 --> 00:44.044
You're supposed to say
African-American, Dad.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.379
African-American.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.615
I'm the front,
you're the follow.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.982
I was the follow
last time.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.352
Don't argue, go on.
Go.

01:45.273 --> 01:48.509
( radio playing music )

01:54.848 --> 01:56.450
( honking )

01:56.550 --> 01:58.419
C'mon!

02:41.229 --> 02:43.231
I got him.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.316
Yeah, they're both
brown hair, one that big,

03:02.416 --> 03:03.751
the other
about that big.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.253
And he's wearing,
um...

03:05.353 --> 03:07.054
I don't know what
the fuck he's wearing.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.790
He's, uh...

03:09.890 --> 03:13.994
Man on P.A.:
Will Michael and Sean McNulty
please report to the offices

03:14.094 --> 03:15.729
in the rear
of the market.

03:15.829 --> 03:20.268
Michael and Sean McNulty
please report.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.475
( theme music playing )

03:29.610 --> 03:32.380
* If you walk
through the garden *

03:33.681 --> 03:37.285
* You better
watch your back *

03:37.385 --> 03:41.322
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

03:41.422 --> 03:43.857
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

03:45.459 --> 03:48.996
* If you walk
through Jesus *

03:49.096 --> 03:52.666
* He'll save your soul

03:52.766 --> 03:56.404
* You gotta
keep the devil *

03:56.504 --> 03:59.973
* Down in the hole

04:00.073 --> 04:03.377
* All the angels sing

04:03.477 --> 04:07.648
* About Jesus' mighty soul

04:07.748 --> 04:11.419
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

04:11.519 --> 04:15.055
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

04:15.155 --> 04:18.659
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

04:18.759 --> 04:22.630
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

04:22.730 --> 04:26.500
* You got to
keep the devil *

04:26.600 --> 04:30.037
* Way down in the hole

04:38.145 --> 04:40.814
* Way down in the hole

04:42.215 --> 04:43.984
* Way down in the hole

04:45.986 --> 04:49.323
* Way down in the hole

04:49.423 --> 04:52.493
* Way down in the hole.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.234
One pay phone goes down,
don't mean shit.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.070
Both at the same time...

05:03.170 --> 05:05.238
that's a plan.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.207
- We spooked 'em.
- Busting the runner?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.643
Maybe it's that,
maybe it's something else.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.412
We still got
the tower phones.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.147
And we're up
on Stringer Bell's
pager now, too.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.583
Yeah, but this
is showin' us

05:15.683 --> 05:17.217
just how cautious
these guys are.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.619
We make any
kind of play

05:18.719 --> 05:20.754
and they're ready
to change up on us.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.523
If they're not
using the pay phones
in the low-rises,

05:22.623 --> 05:24.392
then what are
they doing?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
They're walking
to another pay phone.

05:26.059 --> 05:30.998
We might see more traffic
on the tower pay phones.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.336
Sergeant's test
is tomorrow, right?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.472
Four in the afternoon.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.442
You ain't gonna
take it this time?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.344
Sure, why not?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.179
You ain't
gonna study?

05:46.279 --> 05:48.982
- Sure I am.
- ( door slams )

05:49.082 --> 05:51.652
You guys need
to follow some of
the boys out of the pit

05:51.752 --> 05:54.054
and see what they're
using for pay phones.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.457
Excuse me,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.091
is that
a direct order?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.860
I'm just sayin'...

05:59.960 --> 06:01.729
if you want to
follow these assholes
from phone to phone,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.163
why don't you
do it yourself?

06:03.263 --> 06:05.633
I'm in-office,
remember?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.301
Oh, right, right,
they took your gun.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.503
For shooting
your car.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.871
No, no,
that was before.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.340
Oh, that's right,
that was something else.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.142
Right.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.748
You believe this guy?

06:20.848 --> 06:23.651
Like there are
fucking stripes
on his sleeve.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.286
You guys need to get up
on those rooftops today.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.490
See what these mopes
are using for phones.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.443
( laughing )

06:49.543 --> 06:51.278
Yo, c'mere,
look at this shit.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.613
What the fuck
is that?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.548
Yo, Bird told me
that shit.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.916
Look at that.
Look at that.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.519
Fuckin' Peter-puffer.
Get the fuck outta here.

06:58.619 --> 07:02.556
( lullaby playing )

07:13.701 --> 07:17.137
Mr. Omar,
you want ends on this?

07:17.237 --> 07:20.908
Naw, darlin',
I'm cool.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.823
Nice shirt.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.558
Yeah, fuck you.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.092
It takes guts
wearing a pink shirt

07:39.192 --> 07:40.528
on the BPD
Homicide Unit.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.796
Yes, it does.

07:42.896 --> 07:47.535
Guts, or a familiarity
with alternative lifestyles.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.770
What are you chasin'?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.706
- Toyota Camry.
- Whose?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.042
Well, it's listed to some
woman with a county address,

07:55.142 --> 07:57.578
but Saturday my man
Stringer Bell was using it.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.179
You were working
the weekend?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.815
I'm down the Northeast Market
with the kids, right?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.884
Who should
appear before me?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.452
Market day
for String, too, huh?

08:05.553 --> 08:07.154
I know he makes me
if I get too close,

08:07.254 --> 08:09.456
so I put Sean
and Michael on him.
Front-and-follow.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.291
They're so fuckin' good,
I lose track of 'em,

08:11.391 --> 08:13.026
scared the shit
out of myself.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.729
But they stay with him,
spec the Camry,

08:15.829 --> 08:18.465
and Sean,
my flesh and blood,
gets the tag.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.267
Your kids know
front-and-follow?

08:20.367 --> 08:21.535
They fucking love it.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.436
We play spy
in the mall sometimes.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.705
Anyhow...

08:24.805 --> 08:26.640
I got a Woodmoor address
of a woman

08:26.740 --> 08:29.543
who lends her wheels
to Stringer Bell.
It's a start.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.912
The fucking family,
McNulty.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.947
Jesus.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.116
What?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.255
Wallace, Wallace.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.057
Yo, Wallace.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.193
What, what?

08:46.293 --> 08:47.427
Yo, Wallace.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.629
What?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.764
What's this
about here?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.604
This one here?

08:56.704 --> 08:59.973
"A bus traveling
on Central Avenue
begins its route

09:00.073 --> 09:01.809
by picking up
eight passengers.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.844
At the next stop,
it picks up four more,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.313
and then an additional
two at the third stop,
while discharging one.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.082
At the next-to-last
stop, three passengers
get off the bus

09:09.182 --> 09:10.651
- and another two get on."
- Man: Yo, Wallace!

09:10.751 --> 09:12.385
"How many passengers
are still on the bus

09:12.485 --> 09:14.321
when the last stop
is reached?"

09:14.421 --> 09:16.624
Just do it
in your head.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.862
Yo, testers
comin' out today.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.396
New package.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.432
I might be down later.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.034
Later?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.837
Look, I catch you
around the way, a'ight?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.439
Wallace, man.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.241
You can't just
lay up in here.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.575
Seven, right?

09:35.676 --> 09:37.377
Dee been askin'
about shit.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.646
So what?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.547
I been tellin' him
you sick,

09:40.648 --> 09:42.650
but you know he ain't gonna
let me carry that
too much longer.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.451
Now, look,
I be down later...

09:44.551 --> 09:45.653
sometime.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.520
Naw, man,
testers gonna be out.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.322
Look, man,
fuck the testers, a'ight?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.125
Fuck the testers, fuck Dee,
fuck all of that shit.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.326
Just--

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
just let me
hold $10

09:55.028 --> 09:56.730
and I'll give it
back to you by Friday.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.599
How? Dee ain't gonna pay
you for not workin'.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.169
Look, you gonna let me
hold 10, or not?

10:07.540 --> 10:08.676
Eight?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.944
Damn, Cyril, look.
Close your eyes.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.014
You workin'
a ground stash.
20 tall pinks.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.883
Two fiends come up to you
and ask for two each,

10:15.983 --> 10:18.518
another one cops three.
Then Bodie hands you
off 10 more,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
but some white guy
rolls up in a car,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.689
waves you down,
and pays for eight.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.356
How many vials
you got left?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.759
15.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.394
How the fuck you able
to keep the count right,

10:27.494 --> 10:28.729
you not able to do
the book problem then?

10:28.829 --> 10:31.799
Count be wrong,
they fuck you up.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.837
Man:
Naw, he comin' to you.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.038
- Man #2: Day?
- Yeah.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.639
He in a rush
or somethin'?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.074
No, we told him
to do it like that.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.010
He has his hand out
last night

10:43.110 --> 10:45.045
and we told him
first thing, you know,
first thing today.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.680
He ain't comin'
into the tower?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.548
Naw, naw,
not like that.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.817
Just run 20
on down to him.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.518
He gonna roll
on his way, all right?

10:51.618 --> 10:53.620
Be there in like,
an hour, maybe.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.689
- Who gonna know?
- Little Man,

10:55.789 --> 10:57.958
- he know Day.
- A'ight.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.626
That was
Stringer Bell?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.528
Well, calling down
to tower pay phone number one

11:01.628 --> 11:03.731
after taking a page,
15 minutes ago.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.098
- We know Little Man?
- Yeah.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.100
Enforcer in
the 2-2-1 building.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.336
Okay, so he's rollin'
out of the 2-2-1

11:09.436 --> 11:13.040
in about a half an hour
or so with 20 whatevers,

11:13.140 --> 11:15.075
to hand off
to someone named Day.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.277
Product coming
out of the towers.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.947
We're usually trying
to catch that shit going in.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.514
Yeah, well, if you
want to catch them,

11:21.614 --> 11:23.250
we're gonna
have to hustle.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.821
Wallace, man,
he buggin'.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.589
Where he be at?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.024
Nowhere.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.160
He just lays around
all day, you know?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.896
Beg my ass off
for sandwich money.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.331
You worried
about him?

11:38.431 --> 11:41.501
I mean,
shit ain't right, Dee.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.236
You might could talk
with him some.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.838
What the fuck, man?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.673
If he don't wanna be down
here, that's on him.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.108
I mean, it ain't like

11:48.208 --> 11:50.677
nobody holdin' no gun
to his head or nothin'.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.880
Yeah, but he ain't
about nothing else.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.750
He up in his room and shit
all the damn day.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.321
Alright, tell Wallace
to come see me, a'ight?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.522
A'ight.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.825
( rap music playing )

12:07.260 --> 12:09.096
I'll be right back.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.086
It's been two hours.

12:33.186 --> 12:37.457
What if Little Man
ain't working in
the 2-2-1 today?

12:39.793 --> 12:43.130
What if this Day guy
don't come?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.467
What if he came
already and we just
missed the pick-up?

12:47.567 --> 12:51.171
Yo, Herc, what if your
mother and father never met?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.846
- How's shop doin'?
- Steady rollin'.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.580
All right, then,
let's take a ride, then.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.215
Beef run.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.884
Beef run, where at?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.786
Pulaski, baby,
the good shit.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.022
Get in the car, man.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.663
Hey, yo, Poot.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.499
You the man
for an hour.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.144
Shit, look at me.

13:54.734 --> 13:55.903
Kima.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.605
Greggs:
The Lincoln, we're on it.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.981
Hang back.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.918
Let's see
where he goes.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.429
I don't understand that,
never did.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.064
Damn, Bey!

14:24.164 --> 14:25.999
How can you stand that shit
with all that hot shit on it?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.468
Man, trick is
not to give a fuck, boy.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.371
I got this,
you know me.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.839
So what?

14:32.940 --> 14:34.707
My uncle just
cut y'all loose today?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.143
Naw, we're celebratin'.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.711
Stinkum got some points
on some fresh territory.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.313
Yeah, I heard about that.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.482
- So, how much is yours
in the package?
- 20.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.551
But first, we gotta
run off them nigga's
that been down there.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.955
Ain't no thing.
A bunch of off-brand
nigga's is all.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.623
I know you keep runnin'
that pit the way you been,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.159
you gonna see
points, too.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.228
Yeah, well, you know,
shit, I'm here waitin'.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.098
It'll come,
right, Stink?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.133
Yeah, I been talkin'
to Orlando, right?

15:00.233 --> 15:04.104
He said he got
this good coke connect
from New Orleans.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.107
Orlando, huh?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.110
Yeah, he want me to put what
he can get out into the court,

15:10.210 --> 15:12.245
you know, a little extra
on the side.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.381
I don't know, Dee.
You better talk to your
uncle about that one.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.283
- Yeah, definitely.
- I hear that.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.851
Yeah, I'm gonna see
what he say on it.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.787
Yeah.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.889
But, you know,
today is your day, man.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.325
- Stink day.
- It's his night, too.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.327
Yeah, man, we gonna
break out tonight, daddy.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.796
Bring some of
Orlando's good pussy

15:29.896 --> 15:31.264
over there
by Little Man's.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.733
Tear the roof off that mother,
the roof off the mother.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.768
You up, Dee?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.337
You up?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.772
Yeah, he up.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.009
- Yeah, you up.
- Nigga, I'm up!

15:42.109 --> 15:45.178
You don't gotta
ask twice.

15:48.815 --> 15:52.052
What's wrong?
No, no, no.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.554
He give a fuck now.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.889
Water, water.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.959
( police radio chatter )

16:04.797 --> 16:06.033
Step out of
the car, sir.

16:06.133 --> 16:10.270
- What I do?
- Step out of the car.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.408
Go around to
my partner here.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.976
Man, look,
I'm already late.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.645
Put your hands on
the roof, please, sir.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.382
Sir, you were observed
in one of the city's designated

16:22.482 --> 16:24.384
drug-free,
anti-loitering zones,

16:24.484 --> 16:28.255
where a drug suspect
leaned into your vehicle,
handing you something.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.922
And when we signaled
for you to stop,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.325
you were leaning over as if
attempting to conceal something

16:32.425 --> 16:34.294
beneath the passenger
side seat.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.263
C'mon, now, look,
enough of this shit,
now, c'mon.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.998
- Is there something
beneath that seat, sir?
- Naw, no.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.733
Then you don't mind
if we take a look, right?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.569
Fuck y'all.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.138
This is some bullshit.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.947
That's none of your business,
right there, a'ight?

16:55.048 --> 16:57.584
How 'bout if I make it
my business, huh?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.378
( pager beeping )

17:32.785 --> 17:34.654
( engine starts )

17:44.131 --> 17:46.533
You rang?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.602
Who's he?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.771
Damien Lavell Price.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.475
He takes 20,000 in cash
out of the 2-2-1 building.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.345
Lester picked up the drop
from one of the tower phones.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.947
We followed him up
Reservoir Hill 'til he
knew we were on him.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.015
He's a legislative aide?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.717
Who paged me?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.020
He's in your office.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.690
We popped him
with $20,000 in cash.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.924
What kind of PC?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.226
Right off the wire.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.395
Stringer Bell to someone
on a tower phone.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.564
We thought we were gonna
come up with drugs.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.166
Got money instead.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.568
I know this guy.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.074
Orioles won
last night.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.444
Bullpen stood up
to Boston.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.481
You get that money
cracking cribs, or what?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.617
I'd like to speak
to my attorney.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.892
He was driving for
one of the politicians

18:45.992 --> 18:47.594
at this fundraiser
I got dragged to.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.929
- Which one?
- Greggs: Someone from
Annapolis,

18:50.029 --> 18:51.331
from the looks
of his ID anyway.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.166
Lieutenant,
what do we charge here?

18:53.266 --> 18:56.336
- He say the money's his?
- He doesn't say shit.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.972
Keep the cash,
write him a receipt.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.875
He wants to put
a claim in with the city
solicitor, he can.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.512
But they're gonna ask him
where he got the pile.

19:05.612 --> 19:10.116
Uh-oh,
the angel of death.

19:10.217 --> 19:13.820
- Who's that?
- Major Reed, IID.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.628
Lieutenant,
a word.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.633
( music playing )

19:32.239 --> 19:34.374
What's up?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.910
How you doin'?

19:38.010 --> 19:41.314
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.316
Everything is good?

19:43.416 --> 19:45.852
I'm a'ight.
I'm a'ight.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.188
I mean, you fixed for cash
or something, man?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.358
'Cause...

19:51.458 --> 19:55.228
200, if you need
a little something.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.231
Really, the thing to do
is just to ask for it.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.932
I mean, that's all
I do anyway

20:00.032 --> 20:01.501
is put money
in your fucking pocket

20:01.601 --> 20:03.169
to make sure you don't
stray away from the nest!

20:03.270 --> 20:04.504
Sit down.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.539
Listen, the last
motherfuckin' thing I need

20:06.639 --> 20:09.876
is for the clean name
on my liquor license
to be dirtied

20:09.976 --> 20:12.078
the fuck up by you.
You understand that,
right?!

20:12.178 --> 20:15.382
Avon, c'mon, man.
C'mon, Avon.

20:18.451 --> 20:22.522
( muffled shouting )

20:30.196 --> 20:32.532
Do your fucking job!

20:36.603 --> 20:38.305
Shit.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.013
I checked with the state
personnel department.

20:47.113 --> 20:50.450
They got him on
the payroll of Senator
Davis' district office

20:50.550 --> 20:52.619
for more than a year.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.988
He did four years
in Hagerstown for
daytime B & E.

20:56.088 --> 21:00.126
Before that, drug charges
and a PBJ on a check charge.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.561
And now, we catch him
coming out of the towers

21:01.661 --> 21:04.230
with 20 grand in manicured,
banded money.

21:04.331 --> 21:08.368
You brought him in here
on what charge?

21:08.468 --> 21:09.936
Civil forfeiture.

21:10.036 --> 21:13.105
Until he tells us a legitimate
source for that money,

21:13.205 --> 21:14.474
we keep it.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.844
So you have
no criminal charge.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.946
No, just the money.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.952
Give it back.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.888
Sir?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.090
Give the man
back his money.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.925
Sir, we pulled this
off the wire,

21:33.025 --> 21:36.396
with one of our
suspects telling another
to expect the pick-up.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.964
It's drug money
in that car.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.766
Give him
back his money.

21:39.866 --> 21:44.671
Write it up as
an unwarranted car stop.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.908
Now I ask you to put a charge
on a drug dealer, Lieutenant.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.610
That's all I ask.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.479
And now
I've got wiretaps,

21:52.579 --> 21:54.914
pager clones,
affidavits coming
out my ass.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.883
And you--

21:56.983 --> 21:59.686
you're in people's
shit where you're not
supposed to be.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.921
- Sir--
- I'm shutting this down,
Lieutenant.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.823
You charge
what you can

22:03.923 --> 22:07.026
and you do it
by the end of the week.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.528
We did nothing
wrong here.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.797
You jacked up
a senatorial aide.

22:10.897 --> 22:14.667
You went into his pocket,
pulled out $20,000.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.503
And though there's
no criminal charge,

22:16.603 --> 22:19.138
you think it wise
to try to keep it.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.240
You shit
all over yourself,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.944
all over me,
all over this department.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.380
Now, I told you,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.783
no surprises,
remember?

22:38.024 --> 22:39.826
20 even.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.194
Sign here,

22:42.294 --> 22:44.196
or you can count it
yourself if you want.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.032
So I can leave now?

22:58.144 --> 23:01.147
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck that was about?

23:07.186 --> 23:08.688
This is bullshit.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.591
We just gave back 20 large
of Barksdale's money.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.700
Hey!
What the fuck?!

23:20.800 --> 23:23.436
Let me guess,
the deputy?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.237
How's he got
onto this so quick?

23:25.337 --> 23:26.906
- I told him.
- You told him?

23:27.006 --> 23:28.475
Why would you be
fucking telling him?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.309
He's the deputy
for operations

23:30.409 --> 23:33.279
and I just jacked up
an aide to a state senator.
How do I not tell him?

23:33.379 --> 23:34.914
Yeah, lieutenant,
have you noticed

23:35.014 --> 23:36.516
there hasn't been a complaint
so far from the senator?

23:36.616 --> 23:38.585
And you know why?
'cause what the fuck

23:38.685 --> 23:40.787
is his driver doing coming
out of the high-rises carrying
that kind of money?

23:40.887 --> 23:42.221
That's what
I told the deputy.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.422
Yeah, and what
did he say?

23:43.523 --> 23:45.157
We should mind
our own business?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.126
Fucking give the man
back his money and go
the fuck away?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.595
Pretty much.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.130
Except he said a few things
for my benefit, too.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.099
Like how I had
shit all over him.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.167
Like how he was shutting us
down the end of this week.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.736
The fuck he is.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.104
We're done.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.906
I go past Friday
and I'm buried.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.173
He told me that.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.408
He's gonna bury you
for what?

24:02.509 --> 24:03.910
You're doing
your fucking job.

24:04.010 --> 24:04.911
( chuckling )

24:05.011 --> 24:06.613
You think the job
is gonna save me?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.280
You think
it's gonna save you?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.749
Chain-of-command,
Detective.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.283
That's all I got
from the deputy today.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.885
Chain-of-command?

24:12.985 --> 24:15.087
Did you tell your major
about the senator's driver?

24:15.187 --> 24:16.623
Did you tell
the colonel?

24:16.723 --> 24:18.558
No? Then where's your
fucking chain-of-command?

24:18.658 --> 24:19.959
What's the shift
lieutenant doing,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.895
going up the back stairs
to the deputy ops?!

24:25.031 --> 24:26.733
What are you saying?

24:26.833 --> 24:28.000
Nothing.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.204
Goddamn right.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.273
Why, he got
something on you?

24:34.373 --> 24:36.408
You say you got
the deputy's ear.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.944
What the fuck's
he got on you?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.146
Only rank, Detective.

24:47.286 --> 24:50.723
( rap music playing )

24:52.024 --> 24:53.626
( chattering )

25:32.264 --> 25:33.900
Hey, yo, Stink.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.668
What about
the rules, yo?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.970
Special occasion, yo.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.019
Yo, Bey.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.391
I'm gonna throw up.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.661
No, you ain't.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.132
Burrell thinks
I crossed him.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.601
He said this to you?

26:42.702 --> 26:44.570
In so many words.

26:44.671 --> 26:48.074
- You need to explain--
- Explain what?

26:48.174 --> 26:51.377
That I'm bringing in a case
that goes everywhere?

26:51.477 --> 26:53.880
Today, it was some
senator's driver.

26:53.980 --> 26:57.416
Two days from now,
a city councilman, maybe.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.218
He asked for a charge
on Barksdale.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.187
That's all
he asked for.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.589
This thing with
the legislative aide,
who could've foreseen that?

27:03.690 --> 27:08.094
He saw it.
Burrell.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.831
See, this is the thing
that everyone knows
and no one says,

27:11.931 --> 27:13.933
you follow the drugs,
you get a drug case.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.601
You start
following the money,

27:15.702 --> 27:17.603
you don't know
where you're going.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.972
That's why they don't want
wiretaps or wired CIs

27:20.072 --> 27:21.640
or anything else
they can't control.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.142
Because once that
tape starts rolling,

27:23.242 --> 27:26.378
who the hell knows
what's gonna be said?

27:28.547 --> 27:32.719
That son of a bitch
McNulty asked me what
the deputy had on me.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.254
He actually
asked me that.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.024
What'd you say?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.436
( music playing )

27:58.978 --> 28:01.380
( shuts off music )

28:01.480 --> 28:03.750
Yo, where
everybody go?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.952
Where the girls go?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.020
Fuck it, man,
party broke.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.422
We drunked out
and fucked out.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.024
Yo, y'all send me
out for liquor

28:12.124 --> 28:14.593
and by the time I get back,
the shit is dead.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.729
Look at this,

28:16.829 --> 28:20.933
the Knicks done fucked up
their draft again.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.271
Yo, what's with her?

28:25.371 --> 28:28.274
I done
fucked her silly.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.176
What can I say?

28:33.112 --> 28:35.647
She snorted half the shit
we brought up in here, too.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.117
That greedy bitch.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.804
Yo, Bey.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.591
( knocking )

29:19.691 --> 29:21.227
You wanted
to see us?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.029
The hell is this?

29:23.129 --> 29:26.098
I got copied
this morning.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.034
It's just
what it looks like.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.536
A memo signed
by the deputy ops,
Rawls and Forester,

29:30.636 --> 29:32.338
telling us to pack it
in and come home.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.340
We're supposed to come down
on the wire by Friday,

29:34.440 --> 29:37.476
ship the computers back to
the DEA task force by Monday,

29:37.576 --> 29:39.879
and charge whoever we have
by the end of next week.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.614
Yeah?
Who do you have?

29:42.714 --> 29:44.483
Couple of
mid-level guys.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.252
Anton Artis,
AKA, Stinkum.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.955
Shooter name of Bird wanted
for the killing of Gant,

29:49.055 --> 29:50.656
he was the witness
in your court.

29:50.756 --> 29:51.858
That's it?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.625
Except for a couple
of hangers-on, yeah.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.494
Why are they
doing this?

29:55.594 --> 29:57.096
Why now?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.531
Well, we picked up a bag man
coming out of the high-rises

29:59.631 --> 30:01.600
carrying 20 grand
in cash yesterday.

30:01.700 --> 30:02.801
So?

30:02.902 --> 30:04.136
So, he works
for Clay Davis--

30:04.236 --> 30:06.205
Of the 39th
Legislative District.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.341
The deputy
was displeased.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.809
It's okay though.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.778
We gave the money back,
said we were sorry.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.546
What can Daniels do?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.015
Not a fucking thing.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.649
The deputy
chewed his ass out

30:17.749 --> 30:19.185
and sent him
the same direct order

30:19.285 --> 30:20.686
you have on your desk
right there.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.422
Get me Burrell
on the line!

30:23.522 --> 30:27.059
Detectives, when you swore
that your affidavit was true

30:27.159 --> 30:28.961
to the best
of your ability,

30:29.061 --> 30:31.763
what did the circuit court
of Baltimore do?

30:31.864 --> 30:33.832
You gave us
the wire.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.235
For how long,
Detective McNulty?

30:36.335 --> 30:37.536
60 days, now.

30:37.636 --> 30:40.672
And how long
have you monitored
these phone extensions?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.074
40 days, maybe.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.144
Deputy Burrell
is on the line.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.048
Erv, it's Phelan.

30:49.148 --> 30:52.018
Kiddo, you're fucking
with me here.

30:52.118 --> 30:55.754
Yes, yes,
you are.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.657
Erv, listen to me.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.559
The circuit court
signed two orders

31:00.659 --> 31:03.529
for a total of 60 days
of telephonic surveillance.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.732
Now, I'm looking at a copy
of a memo from your office

31:06.832 --> 31:10.069
telling me I can't
have my 60 days.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.171
You're not hearing me.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.840
The circuit court
for Baltimore

31:14.941 --> 31:17.776
ordered 60 days
on this tap.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.246
The court
wants its 60 days.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.781
Now, if you take
this wire down on Friday,

31:22.881 --> 31:25.717
you'll be in contempt
of court on Monday...

31:25.817 --> 31:28.154
understood?

31:28.254 --> 31:31.757
And all the best
to Arlene and the kids.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.126
Yeah.

31:38.130 --> 31:41.100
Who's your daddy now?

31:50.042 --> 31:54.113
( pager beeping )

31:54.213 --> 31:56.215
Look, I didn't do
a damn thing, Lieutenant.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.184
You got a beef,
it's with the judge.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.851
Yeah, he got
the deputy's memo,

31:59.952 --> 32:02.721
he called his own shot.

32:02.821 --> 32:06.025
Well, ask Greggs
if you don't believe me.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.096
Look, I gotta go.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.524
Kima!

32:44.830 --> 32:46.232
Deputy called,
mad as the devil.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.100
Tell 'em
to quit packing.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.736
We're back up
on the wire.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.938
Kima...

32:53.039 --> 32:55.574
McNulty or the judge?
Or both?

32:55.674 --> 32:58.110
This time, the judge.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.921
Ask me a question.
Any question.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.190
I thought you
weren't gonna study.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.791
C'mon, this job
is common sense.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.326
Ask me a question,
dickless.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.162
See how I do.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.731
- According to Q-1--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.400
Hold up,
help me out here.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.968
You have to know 'em
by the numbers?

33:23.069 --> 33:24.603
It helps.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.473
Makes it sound more
professional that way.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.342
According to Q-1,

33:30.442 --> 33:32.778
the general order
covering sexual harassment,

33:32.878 --> 33:35.714
in the event a female officer
in your squad complains

33:35.814 --> 33:39.351
that her side partner
has sexually harassed her,

33:39.451 --> 33:43.021
you should A-- notify
the commanding officer,

33:43.122 --> 33:46.492
B-- notify
the shift lieutenant,

33:46.592 --> 33:50.596
or C-- notify the ranking
female officer.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.432
I go with D.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.367
D?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.236
Yeah, bitch-slap
the side partner

33:57.336 --> 33:59.138
for dipping into
my private stock,

33:59.238 --> 34:02.274
then take missy home
and fuck her 'til
she smiles.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.161
What the hell?

34:42.914 --> 34:46.152
( chattering )

34:54.993 --> 34:56.195
Woman: When a small
change in price

34:56.295 --> 34:57.829
creates a large
change in demand,

34:57.929 --> 35:00.466
then demand is said
to be elastic.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.534
But some products
are inelastic,

35:02.634 --> 35:05.904
meaning a change in price
does not affect demand.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.939
Some key factors
that affect

35:08.039 --> 35:10.609
the elasticity
of demand are what?

35:10.709 --> 35:11.943
Mr. Bell?

35:12.043 --> 35:13.579
Desire.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.514
Consumer need.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.017
Right, specifically,
the ability of a consumer
to delay acquisition.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.420
What else can affect
the elasticity?

35:49.848 --> 35:51.450
( pencil point snaps )

35:55.254 --> 35:57.088
My pencil
lost its point.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.157
All the girls
say so.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.528
( laughing )

36:02.628 --> 36:05.864
Damon, we got work orders here
and ain't nothin' happenin'.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.267
I mean, these jobs
were promised for yesterday

36:08.367 --> 36:09.801
and people gonna be
comin' in here

36:09.901 --> 36:11.970
askin' for they work
and nothin' been done.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.806
Man, fuck 'em.
Let 'em wait.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.876
No, no, you not
gonna bring that corner
bullshit up in here,

36:17.976 --> 36:19.978
you hear me?

36:20.078 --> 36:23.882
Yo, you know what we got here?
We got an elastic product.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.484
You know what
that mean?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.619
That mean when people
can go elsewhere

36:27.719 --> 36:30.456
and get their printing
and copying done,
they gonna do it.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.158
You acting like
we got an inelastic
product and we don't.

36:33.259 --> 36:39.164
Now, I want this to run like
a true fucking business.

36:39.265 --> 36:42.801
Not no front,
not no bullshit.

36:42.901 --> 36:46.171
Understand me?

36:46.272 --> 36:48.574
I'm serious.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.145
Where you snatch
this ol' wreck from?

36:54.246 --> 36:55.514
Out Frederick Road.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.517
Ditch it over Eastside
when we done.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.152
Check it.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.555
Him there and that
other fool there.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.757
They the only ones
might be trouble.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.260
I'm gonna drop Scar, you just
drop that other motherfucker.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.462
Naw, naw, just Scar.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.731
His boy break,
we gonna let him.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.601
But if he raise up,
I'm on him, see?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.469
Damn, I wish Bird
was here, man.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.037
Bird be lovin' this shit
right here.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.472
Which do remind me...

37:20.572 --> 37:21.907
we get up outta here,

37:22.007 --> 37:24.476
you need to drop that shit
down a storm drain.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.479
Now gimme some time
to go around the block

37:27.579 --> 37:31.283
and set up on
the other side, all right?

37:35.621 --> 37:39.891
( distant sirens wailing )

38:03.449 --> 38:05.684
What up? Who got
black tops, yo?

38:10.422 --> 38:12.458
Omar:
Hey, now.

38:12.558 --> 38:15.394
- ( gunshots )
- Man: Oh, shit!

38:16.094 --> 38:18.296
What the fuck?!

38:18.397 --> 38:20.866
( gunshots )

38:23.234 --> 38:25.404
( groans )

38:30.776 --> 38:33.044
( panting )

38:37.483 --> 38:40.452
( whistling "The Farmer
in the Dell" )

38:50.662 --> 38:53.298
Omar: Hey, yo,
lesson here, Bey.

38:53.399 --> 38:57.068
You come at the king,
you best not miss.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.794
( distant sirens wailing )

39:37.042 --> 39:38.844
Man:
Yo, Stink's been got.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.547
- Man #2: Stink?
- Bey caught one, too,
in the leg.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.148
Shit, man,
what happened?

39:43.248 --> 39:45.083
They down the Gulley
on Edmondson.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.518
Fucking Scar, man.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.920
Naw, ain't him.
Omar, man!

39:49.020 --> 39:50.288
- Omar!
- Omar?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.757
Bounty's goin' up
on that bitch.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.559
That fucks us.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.293
We had Stinkum
tied up with a bow

39:55.393 --> 39:56.528
from the arrest
of the runner.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.196
And now he's out
of the case.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.098
The man's a fucking
loose cannon.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.800
Literally.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.402
We gotta pull
his ass up at least.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.905
It's a dime on this
cocksucker's head.

40:07.005 --> 40:10.308
One of you motherfuckers
need to step up.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.010
Where you go
with that?

40:12.110 --> 40:13.645
Maryland General.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.548
Walked up in there and told
'em I was on the corner,

40:16.648 --> 40:18.550
- caught a stray.
- Police come talk to you?

40:18.650 --> 40:20.185
Just a roller,
no Homicide.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.688
Put it out there.
Not just our people,
either.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.156
I'm talkin' about any nigga
who wanna step up.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.358
You put out the word.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.795
It's 10 on Omar
or any motherfucker
that standin' with Omar.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.396
Y'all niggas
ain't got shit to do

40:31.497 --> 40:32.598
but be on this
motherfuckin' hunt.

40:32.698 --> 40:36.067
- Now be on it.
- All: A'ight.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.815
So, what you think,
homes?

40:49.915 --> 40:53.619
I'm thinkin'
this is the worst part
of the game, man.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.855
Best we do is
break out even, right?

40:56.955 --> 40:57.889
What?

40:57.989 --> 41:00.225
I'm sayin' this shit
got personal.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.928
Ain't nothin' else to it.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.864
So you talkin' about
lettin' it slide?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.734
For a time, maybe.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.403
I'm sayin' we put
the word out that you
ready to talk a truce.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.305
When this nigga come out
from underneath his rock,

41:14.405 --> 41:16.908
then you hit
that nigger.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.945
But right now, this shit
got out of hand, yo.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.239
( baby crying )

41:48.339 --> 41:50.475
What you want me
to say?

41:50.576 --> 41:52.110
Hey, looky here, man.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.212
I don't nothin' about
Stink gettin' dropped.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.182
And I don't know
nothing about Bey taking
one in the leg either.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.785
I mean, I don't know
nothin' about none
of this crazy nonsense.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.753
Oh, I don't know,
it came back to us quick.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.488
Well, you know
how that be.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.491
Everybody want to believe
the worst about Omar.

42:06.592 --> 42:08.860
But live and let live,
you know?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.496
I don't see you lettin'
them slide on Brandon.

42:11.597 --> 42:13.665
Well, if I was gonna
come after certain people,

42:13.765 --> 42:16.301
I definitely wouldn't want
to give y'all fine people

42:16.401 --> 42:17.936
any cause for concern.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.971
I mean, there are
some rules here, right?

42:20.071 --> 42:21.740
- Rules?
- Yeah.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.542
No mistakes,
no bystanders.

42:24.643 --> 42:27.946
No taxpayers gettin'
caught up in the mix.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.248
I mean, you just get in close
and you hit the right nigga.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.917
And lose the gun
afterward,

42:32.017 --> 42:33.719
that'd be a rule,
too, I think.

42:33.819 --> 42:35.621
One thing, Omar.

42:35.721 --> 42:38.256
Having Stinkum dropped
kinda fucks us with our thing.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.825
How so?

42:39.925 --> 42:42.027
We had Stink caught up
with four G-packs on a re-up.

42:42.127 --> 42:44.429
And maybe we could've built
something on top of that.

42:44.529 --> 42:45.931
Roll him up
at Stringer, maybe.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.033
McNulty:
Now he's got
no roll to him.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.568
So, the point is, Omar,
while we're all grateful

42:50.669 --> 42:52.537
for the case
you gave us on Bird,

42:52.638 --> 42:55.373
and we all have a certain
admiration for your
do-it-yourself nature--

42:55.473 --> 42:58.209
We need you
to hang back.

42:58.309 --> 43:01.279
Hey, look, man,
it ain't all up to me, right?

43:01.379 --> 43:02.881
Huh?

43:02.981 --> 43:05.450
I got a bounty
on my head.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.919
Yeah, we saw the van.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.958
Look, man, I do what
I can do to help y'all,

43:13.058 --> 43:15.093
but the game
is out there.

43:15.193 --> 43:18.129
And it's either play
or get played.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.303
What, that it?

43:26.838 --> 43:29.675
Gentlemen.
Ma'am.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.616
Lester,
are we still cops?

43:38.717 --> 43:40.551
Technically,
I suppose so.

43:40.652 --> 43:43.188
Okay, I was
just checking.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.524
Keisha ain't called,
and she ain't been home.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.860
How was she
when you left her?

43:48.960 --> 43:51.462
She was sick,
I told you that.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.198
She missed work
last night

43:53.298 --> 43:56.301
and she ain't
been down there to pick up
her check today either.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.640
You know somethin'?

44:02.741 --> 44:04.609
This game...

44:04.710 --> 44:06.978
this thing
with my uncle.

44:07.078 --> 44:10.048
Might not
be right for me,
I'm thinkin'.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.351
Why you say that?

44:13.451 --> 44:16.454
Nothing good to it
but the money.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.890
Sounds a lot
like my job.

44:20.091 --> 44:25.230
I mean, you got people
using each other,

44:25.330 --> 44:27.432
scammin' each other...

44:30.468 --> 44:33.739
cuttin' each other up
'cause they late on a bill,

44:33.839 --> 44:36.207
shootin' folks 'cause

44:36.307 --> 44:40.779
there might be
a fucking dollar in it.

44:40.879 --> 44:44.049
It get to sometime like
I can't even fucking breathe.

44:44.149 --> 44:46.484
Like I can't
even get no air.

44:46.584 --> 44:49.287
You know what I mean?

44:49.387 --> 44:51.923
Do somethin' else.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.494
So, you happy
with your job?

44:56.594 --> 44:57.896
Shit.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.697
Well, then, hey,
do somethin' else.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.266
I am,
I'm gonna have to.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.401
Shit.

45:03.501 --> 45:06.371
Can't stay
pretty forever.

45:13.544 --> 45:17.415
It's not forever,
right, Dee?

45:19.217 --> 45:21.186
And then what?

45:23.321 --> 45:26.424
Well, you pretty now.

45:32.497 --> 45:35.066
Now we pretty.

46:00.391 --> 46:03.128
( phone ringing )

46:08.066 --> 46:11.569
( Dee on answering machine )
You got me, holler back.

46:11.669 --> 46:13.238
Man:
Yo, Dee, man.

46:13.338 --> 46:15.874
Raise up an' roll in quick.
Stink been got, man.

46:15.974 --> 46:19.777
You hear me?
They got Stink.

46:25.716 --> 46:27.352
Hey, I need your help.

46:27.452 --> 46:29.387
Who caught the one
from Edmondson last night?

46:29.487 --> 46:30.889
Anton Artis.

46:30.989 --> 46:34.425
Cole, with an assist
from Dunnigan.

46:38.696 --> 46:41.132
Omar was the shooter.

46:41.232 --> 46:42.934
Oh, fuck me.

46:43.034 --> 46:45.136
It's all over
the wiretap.

46:46.704 --> 46:48.206
Okay, let's see, we--

46:48.306 --> 46:50.541
we put down one murder
on the testimony

46:50.641 --> 46:51.943
of this one eyewitness,

46:52.043 --> 46:53.411
who then goes out
and drops somebody else.

46:53.511 --> 46:55.713
Yeah, it was payback
for his boyfriend Brandon.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.615
Anton Artis is Stinkum,

46:57.715 --> 47:00.185
he was one of the boys
who snatched Brandon
and did him up.

47:00.285 --> 47:02.187
I'm sure that motherfucker
had his reasons, Jimmy,
but shit--

47:02.287 --> 47:04.389
You want to give back
the Gant case,

47:04.489 --> 47:06.324
then you go tell Cole
the name of his shooter.

47:06.424 --> 47:08.559
Otherwise, you tell him we're
getting some talk on the wire

47:08.659 --> 47:12.563
and we'll give
him his clearance
once we wrap our case.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.167
But you won't.

47:17.502 --> 47:18.904
No, we won't.

47:19.004 --> 47:21.172
You want me to go
and bullshit Cole

47:21.272 --> 47:22.773
out of his case
for you, huh?

47:22.874 --> 47:24.275
Why don't you go
and tell him yourself?

47:24.375 --> 47:25.576
Are you kidding?

47:25.676 --> 47:26.912
If Rawls sees
my fingerprints on this,

47:27.012 --> 47:30.115
he'll run my nuts
through a cheese grater.

47:34.419 --> 47:37.022
Fuck you, Jimmy.

47:40.825 --> 47:42.627
So, how's it goin'
with it?

47:42.727 --> 47:46.331
Pretty good.
I like this kid who's fucking
my victim's old girlfriend.

47:46.431 --> 47:48.199
So, Ray, uh...

47:48.299 --> 47:51.369
can I talk to you
for a minute?

47:52.703 --> 47:55.406
In my office.

48:05.917 --> 48:09.620
( music playing )

48:09.720 --> 48:11.256
With cases
like this one

48:11.356 --> 48:13.058
you get put in some
strange fucking places.

48:13.158 --> 48:14.825
Cole's doin' good
this year,

48:14.926 --> 48:18.029
he don't need
the clearance.

48:18.129 --> 48:20.231
All right, I know
this kinda fucks him.

48:20.331 --> 48:21.832
You should've seen
that motherfucker's face

48:21.933 --> 48:23.101
when I told him that
you were gonna give him

48:23.201 --> 48:25.703
his shooter
down the road.

48:25.803 --> 48:28.439
He was happy, huh?

48:28.539 --> 48:30.408
Yeah.

48:30.508 --> 48:33.979
He looked at me
like a damn puppy.

48:34.079 --> 48:35.713
I'm sorry, Bunk.

48:35.813 --> 48:38.683
I'll carry it.
Fuck it.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.923
Naw, tonight's mine.

48:48.293 --> 48:51.862
Look, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna roll out.

48:51.963 --> 48:55.233
Here's the money
I would've spent on your ass.

49:00.438 --> 49:01.439
Hey, Jimmy.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.774
Call Nadine
and tell her I caught one

49:03.874 --> 49:06.077
and I'm out
on the street.

49:13.051 --> 49:14.952
I lied for you,
didn't I?

49:25.430 --> 49:29.567
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

49:32.270 --> 49:33.638
Think I might've
fucked something up.

49:33.738 --> 49:36.474
Yeah?

49:36.574 --> 49:39.844
I'm interviewing Omar
a few weeks back.

49:39.944 --> 49:41.212
Mm-hmm.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.480
And he's
giving it to me

49:42.580 --> 49:45.116
that Bird is the shooter
in the Gant case.

49:45.216 --> 49:47.152
He tells me if we
catch up to Bird,

49:47.252 --> 49:48.819
he'll have
the gun on him.

49:48.919 --> 49:50.688
Which he does.

49:50.788 --> 49:54.859
But the thing is
I told him that we needed
an eyeball witness.

49:54.959 --> 49:56.994
At which point,
he volunteers.

49:57.095 --> 49:59.197
Well, maybe he saw it.

49:59.297 --> 50:02.200
Or maybe he put himself in it
just to see Bird locked up.

50:02.300 --> 50:06.404
I got the impression there
wasn't much love between 'em.

50:09.074 --> 50:11.442
I fucked up,
didn't I?

50:11.542 --> 50:13.078
Well, a little.

50:13.178 --> 50:14.779
But the gun matches.

50:14.879 --> 50:17.182
And he's consistent
with our witness

50:17.282 --> 50:19.517
on the description
and the scenario.

50:19.617 --> 50:21.252
So, don't sweat it.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.653
Kima...

50:22.753 --> 50:27.024
you know, interrogation
is more art than science.

50:27.125 --> 50:31.028
You gotta feel your way
through on instinct, mostly.

50:34.832 --> 50:37.068
Come, take a look
at this.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.608
Who are they?

50:43.708 --> 50:47.278
Some dancers who work
at Barksdale's club.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.714
I pulled the names off
of liquor board complaints

50:49.814 --> 50:52.817
and state
employment records.

50:54.685 --> 50:56.754
If you were gonna try
to turn one these girls,

50:56.854 --> 50:58.556
which one
would it be?

51:01.559 --> 51:04.028
- Her.
- Why?

51:04.129 --> 51:05.863
She doesn't have
a record for one thing.

51:05.963 --> 51:07.765
She's just
a DMV Photo.

51:07.865 --> 51:09.300
Why else?

51:09.400 --> 51:11.902
I don't know,
I can't really say.

51:12.002 --> 51:14.071
I like her face.

51:14.172 --> 51:16.274
Soul, conscience, whatever
you want to call it.

51:16.374 --> 51:19.510
She's a citizen, right?

51:19.610 --> 51:21.146
It's in the eyes.

51:21.246 --> 51:24.149
Instinct,
Detective.

51:24.249 --> 51:27.718
( phone ringing )

51:31.156 --> 51:33.391
Yeah?

51:34.859 --> 51:37.828
What?

51:37.928 --> 51:40.165
Who is this?

51:41.699 --> 51:44.602
He did?

51:44.702 --> 51:47.772
Well, how the hell
did you get my number?

51:51.776 --> 51:53.778
Yeah, okay.

51:53.878 --> 51:56.046
Yeah.

51:56.147 --> 51:58.015
( knocking )

51:58.115 --> 51:59.950
Ma'am?

52:00.050 --> 52:01.686
Get this crazy bastard
out of here.

52:01.786 --> 52:02.920
What's the matter?

52:03.020 --> 52:04.822
He set off the smoke
alarm, twice.

52:04.922 --> 52:07.091
That good, huh?

52:07.192 --> 52:10.295
In the bathroom.

52:10.395 --> 52:12.897
- ( knocking )
- Bunk, it's Jimmy.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.368
What the fuck?

52:17.468 --> 52:19.904
Bunk, wake the fuck up.

52:20.004 --> 52:21.639
- Huh?
- Bunk, wake up!

52:21.739 --> 52:23.174
Wha, wha--!

52:23.274 --> 52:26.244
- The fuck are you doing?
- I hear you, Jimmy.

52:26.344 --> 52:29.347
What are you doing?
Where are your
fucking clothes?

52:29.447 --> 52:31.882
( muttering )
They're around.

52:34.285 --> 52:36.187
Who gives a shit?

52:36.287 --> 52:38.523
- C'mon, man.
- No, no, no.

52:38.623 --> 52:41.292
Why'd you burn
your clothes for, man?

52:43.494 --> 52:47.832
Got hair,
got fibers and...

52:47.932 --> 52:50.167
got pussy on it and...

52:50.268 --> 52:52.570
- What, trace evidence?
- Mm-hmm.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.405
You smell pussy?

52:54.505 --> 52:56.641
I don't smell
no pussy no more.

52:56.741 --> 52:58.142
Knock it out.

52:58.243 --> 52:59.810
Shit, I think y'all
can just take my ass home.

52:59.910 --> 53:03.714
Trace lab ain't gonna
have shit on the Bunk.

53:03.814 --> 53:08.052
That shit.
No fuckin'-- no fuckin'
casefile, Detective.

53:08.152 --> 53:11.756
Where are your
fucking shoes, man?

53:11.856 --> 53:14.592
Ma'am,
you seen his shoes?

53:14.692 --> 53:17.728
Give me that pussy and now
you gonna take my shoes.

53:17.828 --> 53:21.866
( muttering )
That ain't right, shit.

53:23.868 --> 53:26.637
( distant sirens wailing )

53:39.049 --> 53:41.619
( beeps )

54:08.279 --> 54:10.781
Oh, shit!

54:10.881 --> 54:12.883
Christ, Jimmy.

54:12.983 --> 54:16.787
( groaning )

54:16.887 --> 54:20.425
Hey, Bunk,
I'll give you that burning
trace evidence makes sense,

54:20.525 --> 54:22.460
but what the fuck did you
plan to wear home?

54:22.560 --> 54:25.763
Huh?

54:25.863 --> 54:28.533
Oh, shit.

54:30.768 --> 54:33.538
Hey, Jimmy,
you know something?

54:33.638 --> 54:37.041
You're no good
for people, man.

54:38.075 --> 54:40.311
I mean, damn.

54:40.411 --> 54:43.013
Everybody around you...

54:43.113 --> 54:45.916
Christ.

54:49.820 --> 54:52.390
