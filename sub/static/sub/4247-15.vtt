off the list.
Nothing?

I left her another

she's probably in the wind.

Liv thinks if we separate b613
from their money supply,

We can starve them to death.

He pushed me against a wall,
we argued, and he left.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.010
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.578
You're looking into b613,

09:06.580 --> 09:08.647
And you may think that
your inquiries look harmless

09:08.649 --> 09:10.282
Or that they
don't draw attention,

09:10.284 --> 09:11.283
But they do.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.251
B613 has trip wires

09:13.253 --> 09:16.254
In every computer system
in every building in this town.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.823
Two days ago, your people
were traipsing through

09:18.825 --> 09:20.559
The d.O.D.'s
redacted budgets.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.594
This morning,
you were poking around

09:22.596 --> 09:24.329
The files of
the congressional budget office.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.664
If I hadn't called in
some favors

09:25.666 --> 09:26.998
With some old associates
of mine,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.668
Men more loyal to me
than they are to jake ballard,

09:29.670 --> 09:33.738
Well, we both know what b613
does to its enemies.

09:33.740 --> 09:38.577
Don't play this game anymore,
olivia.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.313
Then tell me.
How do they do it?

09:41.315 --> 09:43.582
How do they get their money?
How are they funded?

09:44.784 --> 09:46.251
[ sighs ]

09:46.253 --> 09:50.622
You told me I'm supposed to
drag everyone into the light.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.858
That means b613,
too, dad.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.126
[ sighs ]

09:55.128 --> 09:57.596
Help me.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.331
Goodbye, olivia.

10:05.237 --> 10:09.741
For this interview, we need
to go for "sweet, wholesome."

10:09.743 --> 10:10.775
[ gasps ]
how about the blue?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.077
You want to wear
the blue?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.845
Why are you still with him

10:13.847 --> 10:18.016
After everything
he's done to you, to us?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.719
Your father and I
are fine.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.220
Our marriage
is stronger than ever.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.623
He's a cheater.
Karen.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.029
Nobody is perfect.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.332
Nobody.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.203
Headed out
tomorrow morning.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.373
No news, stick to the speech,
rally the base,

10:41.375 --> 10:44.109
And keep the spotlight pointed
directly at you and your agenda.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.410
Wish I could go
with you.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.945
To rural arkansas?

10:46.947 --> 10:49.280
Are teenagers
really that rough?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.216
They're barely speaking
a word to me.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.884
[ sighs ]

10:52.886 --> 10:54.719
Just means they're independent.
I envy you.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.921
Yeah? You want to trade
for a while?

10:56.923 --> 10:58.056
[ chuckles ]

10:58.058 --> 10:59.891
Guess the grass
is always greener.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.728
Hello, olivia.
Andrew.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.829
I'll let you two talk.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.197
When you get back,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.732
I want to see you
on the tennis court.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.668
You seem to love getting
your ass kicked, sir.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.237
Oh, trash talk. Sad.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.238
[ door closes ]

good guy.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.075
[ chuckles ]
yeah.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.411
I want to go over the interview
questions one more time.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.814
Don't get cold feet
on me, ivan.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.417
If you do, I promise
you're gonna regret it.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.087
Dmitri never showed up
for the meet,

11:29.089 --> 11:30.355
And ivan is spooked.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.023
He thinks someone's onto us.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.293
Maybe it's time we put
the brakes on all this.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.295
I mean, it's gotten a little
out of hand, don't you think?

11:37.297 --> 11:38.730
You're scared.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.732
No, I just don't like it
when people go missing.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.200
[ laughs ]

11:42.202 --> 11:44.869
Oh, honey.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.106
You're looking for a way out of
this...But there isn't one.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.409
We're moving ahead --
you and me.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.412
At least
until I decide otherwise.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.087
So, huck was already inside
when you got home?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.755
Charlie!
I just want to be clear.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.456
Huck was already inside?

12:04.458 --> 12:05.290
Yes.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.057
And?
And what?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.960
[ sighs ]
I told you what happened.

12:08.962 --> 12:14.299
Then we argue, and he slams me
into a wall, and he leaves.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.834
So you argue, and <i>then</i>
<i>he slams you into the wall.</i>

12:15.836 --> 12:18.136
Yeah. I don't know why
this is such a big deal.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.471
Before, you said he slammed you
into a wall,

12:19.473 --> 12:21.306
<i>Then</i> you argued.
Same difference.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.342
Look, it [groans]
it's not even worth discussing.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.945
To tell you about it
in the first place.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.246
You bothered
because you know

12:28.248 --> 12:30.081
You don't ever keep things
from me, right?

12:32.051 --> 12:34.753
Right. Yeah.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.122
I'm sorry.
I just...

12:38.057 --> 12:39.424
[ sighs ]

12:39.426 --> 12:44.095
And he slammed me into a wall,
and it all happened so fast.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.964
I-I got mixed up.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.832
I was mixed up,
charlie.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.803
Maybe you should
move in with me.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.938
Huck's been breaking in.
You're not safe.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.974
No, I'm fine.
It's fine, really.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.143
I'll change the locks,
I have a gun,

12:58.145 --> 12:59.477
And I made it pretty clear
to him this time

12:59.479 --> 13:00.912
That he'd better not
mess with me.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.347
[ scoffs ] after he slammed you
into the wall.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.081
Right.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.215
Or before?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.884
You're not sure.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.956
Can I -- I-is it okay
if I drill for a bit?

where ivan is?

he's been running

An anonymous

looking at? How many followers?

to a dummy I.P. Address

it was him.

Oh, there's something else.

online shopping last week.

is over.

would I give him to you?

of the United States

If he had gone public,

He would have brought down sally

And the entire executive branch
of the u.S. Government,
