Would you like some butter      
on your toast, Louise?          

00:56.690 --> 00:58.289
                    Yes, thanks.
      All right.                

00:58.291 --> 00:59.691
             Now, let's see.    

00:59.693 --> 01:02.827
     The butter is on the second
    shelf on the left-hand side.

01:02.829 --> 01:06.564
      I try not to leave the    
 refrigerator door open too long

01:06.566 --> 01:08.933
                 to save energy.

01:16.976 --> 01:21.179
    How much energy do you think
    you saved on that move?     

01:21.181 --> 01:25.850
I didn't save nothing.          
I got the cheddar cheese.       

01:25.852 --> 01:27.518
Wait a minute.                  

01:27.520 --> 01:29.654
        Here goes.              

01:30.756 --> 01:32.891
            Got it!             

01:38.698 --> 01:41.766
Oh, Louise, I'm glad            
you dropped in.                 

01:41.768 --> 01:44.102
It's so nice                    
to have company.                

01:44.104 --> 01:49.574
Archie's been out all night     
driving Mr. Munson's cab.       

01:49.576 --> 01:53.144
It was so lonely sleeping       
          without him.          

01:53.146 --> 01:55.747
    But I made believe          
        Archie was there        

01:55.749 --> 01:58.016
        by talking over         
     the events of the day      

01:58.018 --> 01:59.684
    before I went to sleep.     

01:59.686 --> 02:04.355
      I talked and talked       
  but Archie didn't answer me.  

02:04.357 --> 02:08.126
 It was just like he was there. 

02:08.127 --> 02:09.928
             ARCHIE: Hey, Edith!

02:09.930 --> 02:11.796
Oh! There's Archie!             
      Maybe I'd better go.      

02:11.798 --> 02:13.464
 Oh, no. You finish your coffee.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.665
             I'll be right back.
All right.                      

02:14.667 --> 02:18.737
Oh, Archie, I'm so glad         
you're home.

in the back of my cab all night.

              Here's your dress.

02:26.947 --> 02:30.782
You remembered to pick up       
the dry cleaning!               

02:30.784 --> 02:33.752
Oh, thank you, Archie.          

02:33.754 --> 02:36.121
How was your night?             

02:36.123 --> 02:39.590
                 Same as my day,
                only darker.

     No, no, no. It's all right,
    Edith. I'm too tired to eat.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.630
    I'm off-duty. All I wanna do
    is go up and lay down.      

03:19.632 --> 03:21.866
Would you like some company?    

03:24.003 --> 03:27.038
            I said I'm off-duty.

for your cereal?                

03:47.727 --> 03:49.327
                 No, I like     
        to eat the cereal dry   

03:49.329 --> 03:51.196
         and then I wash it down
              with the milk.

         Mr. Jefferson. Come in.
        GEORGE: Morning.        

03:59.306 --> 04:01.139
George, what are you doing      
away from the store?            

04:01.141 --> 04:02.140
          Don't worry.          

04:02.142 --> 04:03.507
                I left Lionel   
                     in charge. 

04:03.509 --> 04:05.310
Mrs. Bunker, this has nothing   
          to do with you.       

04:05.312 --> 04:06.544
        Where's your husband?   

04:06.546 --> 04:08.713
 He just went upstairs to bed.  

04:08.715 --> 04:10.581
            Well, I gotta talk  
         to him. It's important.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.851
            Oh, well, all right.
                 Come on in.    

04:12.853 --> 04:14.719
I'm sure he ain't asleep yet.   

04:14.721 --> 04:17.154
     Archie, are you in bed yet?

04:17.156 --> 04:19.923
  ARCHIE: No, not yet, Edith.   
  I'm looking out the window.   

04:19.926 --> 04:22.526
Do you know the Jeffersons      
     left their shades up?      

04:24.129 --> 04:26.264
          Did you know          
 they was putting new wallpaper 

04:26.266 --> 04:27.966
 on the wall of their bedroom?  

04:27.968 --> 04:32.737
    Holy cow, them coloreds     
    are wild about stripes.     

04:35.640 --> 04:38.442
         Bunker, come down here!

04:38.444 --> 04:42.413
ARCHIE: That don't sound        
like your voice, Edith.         

04:42.415 --> 04:45.250
 No, Archie. We've got company. 

04:45.252 --> 04:47.651
Yeah, so I see.                 

04:47.653 --> 04:50.121
Thanks for letting me know.     

04:50.123 --> 04:51.489
    Bunker, take a look at this.

04:51.491 --> 04:55.093
It's a $20 bill.                
What did you do, hit a number?  

04:55.095 --> 04:58.096
You gave me $20 when you picked 
up your cleaning just now       

04:58.098 --> 05:00.698
and I gave you $18 change.      

05:00.700 --> 05:02.333
      Well, I remember. So what?

05:02.335 --> 05:05.469
So my $18 was good.             
This 20 is counterfeit.         

05:05.471 --> 05:06.771
             What?              

05:06.773 --> 05:08.306
Are you sure, George?           

05:08.308 --> 05:10.174
              I wouldn't be here
            if I wasn't sure.   

05:10.176 --> 05:12.777
      Look, I checked these     
serial numbers against our list.

05:12.779 --> 05:17.648
     This is 89170412. These are
     counterfeit serial numbers.

05:17.650 --> 05:21.219
            They sound like     
             real numbers to me.

05:27.893 --> 05:30.295
  Let's just say you passed this
    phony on to me by accident. 

05:30.297 --> 05:32.763
    So now all you have to do   
    is reach into your wallet   

05:32.765 --> 05:34.532
          and give me a real one
                on purpose.     

05:34.534 --> 05:37.268
        Listen, I ain't         
    no counterfeiter.           

05:37.270 --> 05:38.970
    The $20 bill I gave you     

05:38.972 --> 05:41.406
was perfectly good currency     
    of the realm.               

05:41.408 --> 05:46.610
That was printed on 100 percent 
    U.S. Government realm.      

05:46.612 --> 05:48.246
Get out of the way, Edith.      

05:48.248 --> 05:49.880
You didn't even look            
    at the bill.                

05:49.882 --> 05:52.283
Certainly I looked at it.       
I look at all big bills.        

05:52.285 --> 05:54.185
     I remember                 
where I got that $20.           

05:54.187 --> 05:55.453
I only got one last night.      

05:55.455 --> 05:57.288
I remember the guy              
  that give it to me.           

05:57.290 --> 05:59.991
And he wasn't no counterfeiter. 
      How do you know he wasn't?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.426
    Ah, come on, Jefferson.     

06:01.428 --> 06:03.461
         I know people.         
  This was a very classy guy.   

06:03.463 --> 06:04.862
 He was dressed up to the nines 

06:04.864 --> 06:07.332
    in a sharp coat that had    
  one of them velvet collars,   

06:07.334 --> 06:11.002
and one of them pearl-gray      
    hamburgers on his head.     

06:12.972 --> 06:14.705
Archie, isn't it possible       

06:14.707 --> 06:17.675
he passed the bill to you       
without knowing it?             

06:17.677 --> 06:20.878
    Oh, no. No way, Louise.     
      This was a rich guy!      

06:20.880 --> 06:23.948
Rich guys know all about money. 
  They was brung up on money.   

06:23.950 --> 06:25.016
    That's how much you know!   

06:25.018 --> 06:26.884
    Rich guys never even see    
        any money.              

06:26.886 --> 06:28.819
All they've got in their pocket 
        is credit cards.        

06:28.821 --> 06:34.592
 All they know is "Charge it,"  
"I'll sign for it" and "Sue me."

06:36.395 --> 06:38.329
Well, don't get yourself        
all excited.                    

06:38.331 --> 06:39.930
Let's have a look               
at the bill, huh?               

06:39.932 --> 06:41.265
I don't want to touch it.       

06:41.267 --> 06:43.501
Just hold it out there          
where I can see it.             

06:43.503 --> 06:46.337
Now I got you, Jefferson.       
 That ain't the 20 I give you.  

06:46.339 --> 06:48.072
     See, I'm awful careful     
    with my big bills           

06:48.074 --> 06:50.074
so they don't get mixed up      
      in the little bills,      

06:50.076 --> 06:51.476
    and get give away           
        in change, see.         

06:51.478 --> 06:52.810
      I take the trouble--      

06:52.812 --> 06:54.078
  I turn down a corner there.   

06:54.080 --> 06:56.881
  I call that the Bunker fold.  

06:56.883 --> 06:58.983
And there ain't no              
Bunker fold in that.            

06:58.985 --> 07:01.419
             It did have a fold 
            there in the corner.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.821
    I straightened it out when  
  I put it in the cash register.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.724
                  I call it     
            the Jefferson press.

07:11.763 --> 07:15.533
Well, nevertheless, prove it.   

07:15.535 --> 07:18.336
     Bunker, if I don't get     
      my money right now,       

07:18.338 --> 07:19.703
you're gonna find yourself      

07:19.705 --> 07:23.474
         on top of the          
  "10 Most Sorry Honky" list.

Jefferson, would you care       
        to step outside?        

07:33.953 --> 07:36.254
                      I'm ready.
Good. Then step outside.        

07:36.256 --> 07:37.455
    I'm going to bed.           

07:37.457 --> 07:39.357
            See that, Bunker?   

07:39.359 --> 07:41.359
         I knew you didn't have 
    the guts to step outside.   

07:41.361 --> 07:43.061
            You know, you are   
            a very small man.   

07:43.063 --> 07:45.129
        I'd hate for money      
        to mean that much to me.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.032
Money don't mean nothing to me. 
What are you talking about?     

07:48.034 --> 07:49.900
I'll show you                   
what money means to me.         

07:49.902 --> 07:51.569
What are we talking about?      
      Twenty dollars, huh?      

07:51.571 --> 07:53.704
              Okay. Ten. Twenty.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.374
          There you are, Edith. 
         Buy yourself a new hat.

07:56.376 --> 08:01.079
  See that? I just threw 20 away
         on the old lady.       

08:01.081 --> 08:03.614
    All right, Bunker,          
      let's step outside.       

08:03.616 --> 08:07.818
     Can't we all sit down      
      and talk this over?       

08:07.820 --> 08:10.121
                 Can't you just 
            stay out of this?   

08:10.123 --> 08:12.190
            This here is between
              Jefferson and me  

08:12.192 --> 08:14.459
         and Jefferson and me,  
      we're going to settle this

08:14.461 --> 08:15.460
                 like gentlemen.

08:15.462 --> 08:19.230
Now, Jefferson, get out.        

08:19.232 --> 08:22.200
      I ain't going nowhere.    
  I ain't finished with you yet.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.534
 Well, I'm finished with you.   

08:23.536 --> 08:25.970
Louise, can I see you           
for a minute in the kitchen?    

08:25.972 --> 08:27.405
                      Yes.      

08:27.407 --> 08:31.542
Louise, what are we             
gonna do about this?            

08:31.544 --> 08:32.977
                I don't know.   

08:32.979 --> 08:35.746
 I've never seen such a stubborn
      man in all of my life.    

08:35.748 --> 08:39.750
Me neither. I never knew        
George could be that way.       

08:41.453 --> 08:43.953
     I was talking about Archie.

08:43.956 --> 08:47.325
Are you saying                  
Archie is wrong?                

08:47.327 --> 08:49.827
  Well, I hope you're not saying
         George is wrong.       

08:49.829 --> 08:53.531
You heard Archie tell George he 
didn't give him that bad bill.  

08:53.533 --> 08:55.266
Don't you believe               
what he said?                   

08:55.268 --> 08:56.634
                Yes and no.     

08:56.636 --> 08:58.269
What do you mean?               

08:58.271 --> 08:59.837
    Yes, I believe he said it   

08:59.839 --> 09:04.509
        and, no, I don't believe
              what he said.     

09:04.511 --> 09:07.011
What are you getting            
so excited about?               

09:07.013 --> 09:08.812
I'll tell you what to do        
with that bill.                 

09:08.814 --> 09:11.882
Take that bill up to Harlem     
and pass it there.              

09:11.884 --> 09:14.252
                    What?       
Don't get excited!              

09:14.254 --> 09:16.987
Just shove it                   
on some guy up there.           

09:16.989 --> 09:18.222
It'll make the rounds,          

09:18.224 --> 09:20.224
it'll wind up in the hands      
of some white guy               

09:20.226 --> 09:22.527
who sells purple Cadillacs.     

09:28.733 --> 09:31.835
And who the hell                
cares about him, huh?           

09:31.837 --> 09:34.438
        Don't believe everything
              Archie says.      

09:34.440 --> 09:36.407
    He's got you brainwashed.   

09:36.409 --> 09:38.476
        Don't you have a mind   
                of your own?    

09:38.478 --> 09:39.877
Yes, I do.                      

09:39.879 --> 09:42.380
                    Then use it.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.616
        Everything George said  
      made perfectly good sense.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.219
To you, maybe, but not to me.   

09:48.221 --> 09:51.255
There, you see?                 
I'm using my own mind.          

09:51.257 --> 09:54.525
And you can't say it's          
because I'm listening to Archie 

09:54.527 --> 09:56.126
 because he ain't here.         

09:56.128 --> 10:01.199
                Not only that,  
             he ain't all there.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.800
You won't listen                
to what I'm trying to--         

10:02.802 --> 10:04.702
        Nothing you say makes   
        any difference to me.   

10:04.704 --> 10:05.869
I'm trying to--                 

10:05.871 --> 10:07.805
        You can talk until      
        you're blue in the face,

10:07.807 --> 10:09.607
     which, come to think of it,
            in your case,       

10:09.609 --> 10:11.475
        would be an improvement.

10:11.477 --> 10:12.610
Hey, Jefferson,                 
don't you think                 

10:12.612 --> 10:14.278
    you can walk away           
    saying that to me.          

10:14.280 --> 10:15.680
Hey, your wife is still here.   

10:15.682 --> 10:17.881
    Wait till you see           
 what I'm going to say to her.  

10:17.883 --> 10:22.320
  It's obvious we have nothing  
more to say to each other. Ever.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.354

Goodbye!                        

10:25.358 --> 10:27.157
              Oh!               

10:27.159 --> 10:28.892
        Hey, Louise, listen--   
            Where is she?       

10:28.894 --> 10:30.228
She's gone.                     

10:30.230 --> 10:31.662
         Well, it's a good thing
                 she is.        

10:31.664 --> 10:33.664
        You should have heard   
        what I had in my mind   

10:33.666 --> 10:35.366
                  to say to her.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.601
     What's the matter with you?

10:36.603 --> 10:40.705
I just had a fight with Louise  
and I feel terrible.            

10:40.707 --> 10:43.941
     Can't you do nothing right?

10:45.310 --> 10:47.311
              I just had a fight
            with her husband    

10:47.313 --> 10:49.947
        and I feel wonderful.   

10:56.288 --> 10:58.689
I'm proud of you, Louise,       
         proud of you.          

10:58.691 --> 11:00.190
Finally come to your senses.    

11:00.192 --> 11:02.960
You see, them people            
can be all sweetness and light  

11:02.962 --> 11:04.595
but when it comes down          
to the nitty,

their true color: white.        

11:09.501 --> 11:11.736
What's the matter with you?     
You mad at me or something?     

11:11.738 --> 11:14.004
         No, I'm not mad at you.
              I'm mad at me.    

11:14.006 --> 11:17.308
Well, either way,               
it's spoiling my lunch.         

11:17.310 --> 11:20.745
     How could I have let myself
    get into a fight with Edith?

11:20.747 --> 11:23.347
    All she was doing           
was defending her husband.      

11:23.349 --> 11:24.682
        Even Perry Mason        
    couldn't do that,           

11:24.684 --> 11:26.850
and he ain't never lost a case. 

11:28.052 --> 11:30.655
  If I was any kind of a friend,

11:30.657 --> 11:33.190
        I'd be over there       
 apologizing to Edith right now.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.660
Why don't you                   
do that, Louise.                

11:35.662 --> 11:36.761
            Do you mean that?   

11:36.763 --> 11:38.929
Sure, go on over there          
and apologize to her.           

11:38.931 --> 11:40.331
But leave your key here         

11:40.333 --> 11:42.866
because you ain't getting       
back into this house.           

11:46.137 --> 11:48.238
 I'll have to come back, George.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.874
              I made your mother
            a solemn promise    

11:50.876 --> 11:54.978
             never to leave you 
        while you were crazy.   

11:54.980 --> 11:56.046
Never mind that.                

11:56.048 --> 11:57.315
Just remember,                  

11:57.317 --> 11:59.317
you did the right thing         
sticking up for your husband,   

11:59.319 --> 12:00.718
because blood                   
is thicker than water.          

12:00.720 --> 12:03.387
            What blood are you  
          talking about, George?

12:03.389 --> 12:07.891
              We're not related,
             we're only married.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.728
      Now, there's only one way 
    we can get out of this mess.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.264
      You and Archie are going  
    to get together and make up.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.433
All right, I'll do that.

Archie or Mr. Jefferson         

12:26.946 --> 12:28.479
is going to admit               
that he's wrong.                

12:28.481 --> 12:30.381
You and Louise have to be       
the peacemakers.                

12:30.383 --> 12:33.917
    I know. But who's gonna     
      make the first move?      

12:33.919 --> 12:36.153

             You two want me    
        to make you some coffee?

Oh, that'd be nice.

          I'll help you, Gloria.

            Come on, sit down   
                right over here.

Oh, Louise,                     
I feel so much better.          

13:13.826 --> 13:17.227
        So do I. I don't know   
             what came over us. 

13:17.229 --> 13:18.629

13:18.631 --> 13:23.934
Louise, remember that $20       
Archie gave me to buy a new hat?

13:23.936 --> 13:26.136
Well, I don't need a new hat.   

13:26.138 --> 13:28.773
I wish you'd take it            
and give it to George.          

13:28.775 --> 13:30.274
            Well, thanks, Edith,

13:30.276 --> 13:32.943
    but wouldn't it be better   
 if Archie gave it back himself?

13:32.945 --> 13:36.881
I don't know how                
we'll ever get him to do that.  

13:36.883 --> 13:38.516
                     I know how.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.285
                Does Archie need
            anything cleaned?   

13:41.287 --> 13:43.987
I was gonna bring in            
his winter coat.                

13:43.989 --> 13:45.489
         Perfect. Get it, Edith.

13:45.491 --> 13:50.027
All right. But I could bring it 
down to the store myself.       

13:50.029 --> 13:51.695
            No, I want George   
                to get it fast. 

13:51.697 --> 13:53.764
         The first thing he does
          when he gets cleaning 

13:53.766 --> 13:55.065
            is go all through   
                  the pockets.  

13:55.067 --> 13:58.402
              We're going to put
                 this in here.  

13:58.404 --> 14:00.304
And George will find it         

14:00.306 --> 14:02.673
and maybe he'll think           
it's Archie's way               

14:02.675 --> 14:04.508
of saying he made a mistake     

14:04.510 --> 14:06.276
without coming out              
and saying it.                  

14:06.278 --> 14:10.414
Oh, Louise,                     
that's a wonderful idea.        

14:10.416 --> 14:16.186
That reminds me                 
of the Ten Commandments.        

14:16.188 --> 14:17.688
                      Which one?

14:17.690 --> 14:21.058
The one by Cecil B. DeMille.    

14:23.528 --> 14:25.463
You remember the part           

14:25.465 --> 14:28.732
where Moses' mother             
puts him in a little basket     

14:28.734 --> 14:31.635
and floats him down the river   
on purpose                      

14:31.637 --> 14:35.573
so that Pharaoh's daughter      
can find him by accident        

14:35.575 --> 14:40.043
and he can grow up              
and be Charlton Heston?         

14:47.385 --> 14:50.654
  George, I have Archie Bunker's
     coat. It needs cleaning.   

14:50.656 --> 14:52.055
                  Uh-uh. No way.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.391
 Now, you take that mangy coat  
        back over there.        

14:54.393 --> 14:56.794
        He tried to put         
     something over on me.      

14:56.796 --> 14:58.662
      He thinks I'm stupid      
    because I'm black.          

14:58.664 --> 15:00.564
  Then you be bigger than him.  

15:00.566 --> 15:02.399
 You just turn the other cheek. 

15:02.401 --> 15:05.402
     That won't do no good.     
  My other cheek's black too.   

15:08.072 --> 15:10.841
              You know, I wish  
        I'd never left Harlem   

15:10.843 --> 15:12.643
        to move in next door    
          to those ugly Bunkers.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.144
What are you talking about?     

15:14.146 --> 15:16.814
  If I still lived in Harlem, I 
 could really get even with him.

15:16.816 --> 15:17.815
How?                            

15:17.817 --> 15:19.082
            By leaving Harlem   

15:19.084 --> 15:21.018
         and moving in next door
          to him all over again.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.489
George, you are going           
to clean his coat.              

15:25.491 --> 15:27.658
I'll take it                    
to the store myself.            

15:27.660 --> 15:28.926
        Go on and take it, then.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.831
Well, look at this!             
Money!                          

15:33.833 --> 15:35.866
            Another 20 bucks.   

15:35.868 --> 15:37.968
                 Hey, these 10s 
                are good. Solid.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.603
You're not really               
going to keep that money?       

15:39.605 --> 15:41.204
No, I'm not going to keep it.   
Good.                           

15:41.206 --> 15:44.041
          I'm going to spend it.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.578
Okay, go ahead. Let Archie      
have the last laugh.            

15:47.580 --> 15:48.879
  Now where are you coming from?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.848
Isn't it obvious                

15:50.850 --> 15:53.083
he put it here on purpose       
for you to find it?             

15:53.085 --> 15:54.852
It's Archie's way               
of apologizing.                 

15:54.854 --> 15:56.921
                      No.       

15:56.923 --> 15:58.022
                You think so?   

15:58.024 --> 15:59.790
Let me put it this way.         

15:59.792 --> 16:02.626
When was the last time          
we found $20                    

16:02.628 --> 16:04.294
in one of Archie Bunker's       
pockets?                        

16:05.363 --> 16:06.430
                You're right.   

16:06.432 --> 16:07.932
             He's trying to make
                 me look bad.   

16:07.934 --> 16:09.332
                He ain't gonna  
             get away with this.

16:09.334 --> 16:11.035
      Where are you going?      

16:11.037 --> 16:13.571
    If anybody's gonna have     
        the last laugh,         

16:13.573 --> 16:15.673
    I'm gonna have it first.    

16:18.810 --> 16:21.812
          Can't sleep.          
 There's no air in this house.  

16:21.814 --> 16:24.414
  There's no air in New York.   

16:25.483 --> 16:27.785
Maybe you can't sleep           

16:27.787 --> 16:31.121
because of the argument         
you had with Mr. Jefferson.     

16:31.123 --> 16:33.423
        Oh, I wouldn't lose     
any sleep over that argument.   

16:33.425 --> 16:34.825
             I won it, didn't I?

16:34.827 --> 16:39.063
I think when two people fight,  
nobody wins.                    

16:39.065 --> 16:43.634
Jeez, that'd be great news      
for Jack Dempsey, you know that?

16:43.636 --> 16:46.870
He could give up his restaurant.
    He's still a champ.         

16:46.872 --> 16:49.773
I was talking                   
about fighting over money.      

16:49.775 --> 16:53.310
        By the way, give me back
    that 20 bucks I give you.   

16:53.312 --> 16:55.112
What 20 bucks?                  

16:55.114 --> 16:58.148
            What I give you     
      to buy yourself a new hat,

16:58.150 --> 16:59.750
             which I didn't mean
             in the first place,

16:59.752 --> 17:02.152
     seeing as I was only trying
    to get Jefferson off my back

17:02.154 --> 17:03.153
                twenty bucks.   

17:03.155 --> 17:04.186
        [DOORBELL RINGS]        

17:04.189 --> 17:07.891
Oh, there's the bell!           
I'll get it.                    

17:07.893 --> 17:10.661
         Whoever it is,         
 tell them to get out of here.  

17:10.663 --> 17:14.765
Louise, George, come in.        
Archie, look who's here.        

17:14.767 --> 17:16.032
Oh, gee.                        

17:16.035 --> 17:19.069
What have you got this time,    
Jefferson? A wooden nickel?     

17:19.070 --> 17:20.971
                         Louise?

17:20.973 --> 17:22.472
Remember, last laugh.           

17:22.473 --> 17:23.573
                         Uh-huh.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.407
          Bunker, this is yours.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.644
          What's mine?          

17:26.646 --> 17:28.045
  This $20 we found in your coat

17:28.047 --> 17:29.647
             your wife sent down
                to be cleaned.  

17:29.649 --> 17:31.181
    Twenty dollars--?           

17:31.183 --> 17:32.983
    You got that in my coat     
        and that's mine?        

17:32.985 --> 17:34.952
That $20 here? Hey, Edith!      

17:34.954 --> 17:36.286
         What is that?          
Oh, Archie.                     

17:36.288 --> 17:39.322
I should have checked           
the pockets. I'm sorry.         

17:39.324 --> 17:42.760
  Oh, gee, I ain't mad at you,  
darling. Whoop-de-do. Hey.      

17:42.762 --> 17:44.061
              Hey.              

17:44.063 --> 17:45.328
I never would have believed     

17:45.330 --> 17:47.131
I left that kind of dough       
in that coat.                   

17:47.133 --> 17:48.331
                  And you       
          wouldn't have known it

17:48.333 --> 17:51.201
                if Mr. Jefferson
                hadn't found it.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.938
He could have kept the money,   
      but he's an honest man.   

17:54.940 --> 17:57.207
Hey, Jefferson.                 
Nice to see you. See you round. 

17:59.678 --> 18:04.682
  Let's go, Louise. I've laughed
        enough for one day.     

18:08.720 --> 18:10.420
      Wait! Wait a minute.      

18:10.422 --> 18:12.690
     Archie, can I see you?     

18:12.692 --> 18:13.957
You're looking at me.           

18:13.959 --> 18:15.525
                         Archie!

18:15.527 --> 18:18.829
          Since you got back $20
         you didn't know you had

18:18.831 --> 18:22.099
and since Mr. Jefferson had     
 a loss because of the bad bill,

18:22.101 --> 18:25.069
             I think you should 
            share this with him.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.304
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.        

18:27.306 --> 18:30.640
     I think you should give him
         at least half of it.   

18:30.642 --> 18:34.411
    You'd still be ahead $10.   

18:34.413 --> 18:38.682
             Oh, please, Archie.
                Be fair.        

18:38.684 --> 18:41.051
Don't tell me what to do.       

18:43.021 --> 18:44.621
Get out of the way.             

18:45.990 --> 18:49.326
Jefferson,                      
I'm going to be fair.           

18:50.428 --> 18:52.295
Seeing as there                 
was a loss here                 

18:52.297 --> 18:54.932
and you and me was both         
involved in the loss,           

18:54.934 --> 18:58.368
well, maybe we ought            
to share this.                  

18:58.370 --> 19:00.437
So here's $10.                  
                         Thanks.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.839
    All right. Fair enough?     

19:01.841 --> 19:03.540
That's nice, Archie.            

19:03.542 --> 19:04.875
Wait a second, Arch.            

19:04.877 --> 19:08.178
That's not fair.                
You're ahead way more than $10. 

19:08.180 --> 19:11.115
        Listen to the meatheaded
         college boy over there.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.751
  I'm holding $10 in my hand.   

19:13.753 --> 19:15.585
         Show me where          
 I'm way more ahead than that.  

19:15.587 --> 19:16.887
Look, Arch,                     

19:16.889 --> 19:19.422
you gave Mr. Jefferson          
a phony $20 bill.               

19:19.424 --> 19:20.891
        I didn't know nothing   
                about that.     

19:20.893 --> 19:22.292
It doesn't make any difference! 

19:22.294 --> 19:26.329
The point is he gave you        
$18 of real money in change     

19:26.331 --> 19:28.431
plus $2 worth                   
of cleaning services:           

19:28.433 --> 19:29.432
that's $20.                     

19:29.434 --> 19:30.700
Add to that the 20              

19:30.702 --> 19:32.903
that he found in your coat      
pocket and returned to you      

19:32.905 --> 19:34.037
because he's an honest man.     

19:34.039 --> 19:35.873
That's $40 you're ahead.        

19:35.875 --> 19:38.008
             Hold it! I just    
         give the man $10 there.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.110
All right, so you're ahead $30. 

19:40.112 --> 19:41.311
                 Thirty dollars?

19:41.313 --> 19:44.148
But the fact remains,           
he gave you $18 cash.           

19:44.150 --> 19:45.482
You only gave him $10 back.     

19:45.484 --> 19:47.484
Why don't you give him          
the other $8 you owe?           

19:47.486 --> 19:50.587
                I ain't going to
                 give him no $8.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.756
Arch, you'll still              
be ahead 22 bucks.              

19:58.496 --> 20:01.665
              Wait a minute.    
         How do you figure that?

20:01.667 --> 20:05.068
Thirty minus eight              
is twenty-two.                  

20:05.070 --> 20:06.736
You're $22 ahead.               

20:06.738 --> 20:14.678
        I'm 22 ahead? Thirty...?
          Huh? Minus eight...?  

20:14.680 --> 20:19.216
         All right, if I'm $22--
        I can add up myself!    

20:22.086 --> 20:23.486
         Jefferson, er,         

20:23.488 --> 20:27.825
 as long as I'm $22 ahead here, 
      and I figure if I--       

20:27.827 --> 20:29.126
  How much should I give him?   

20:29.128 --> 20:30.427
Eight dollars.                  

20:30.429 --> 20:31.695
         All right, $8.         

20:31.697 --> 20:34.097
So I'll give you a $10 bill.    
Give me two ones.               

20:34.099 --> 20:35.232
          I ain't got no change.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.533
But he ain't got no change.     

20:36.535 --> 20:38.235
     I ain't got no change.     
    Who's got change?           

20:38.237 --> 20:40.170
                    No, I don't.
I didn't bring my purse.        

20:40.172 --> 20:41.905
        Oh, jeez,               
  I ain't got no singles here.  

20:41.907 --> 20:43.606
Arch, he gave you               
$18 worth of change.            

20:43.608 --> 20:45.209
You've got to have              
at least three singles.         

20:45.211 --> 20:50.513
  I bought seven cigars and a   
 malted. Is that okay with you? 

20:50.515 --> 20:51.915
                Would this help?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.219
          I owe Louise $3       
from the groceries yesterday.   

20:55.221 --> 20:56.619
That'll help.                   
             How does that help?

20:56.621 --> 20:57.687
Give me the $10.                

20:57.689 --> 20:59.223
         Wait a minute!         

20:59.225 --> 21:01.558
  Arch, you were going to give  
    Mr. Jefferson $8, right?    

21:01.560 --> 21:03.460
         Add $3 to that         
    for the groceries.          

21:03.462 --> 21:05.229
        That's $11              
     you owe Mr. Jefferson.     

21:05.231 --> 21:06.930
    Here's a $10 bill,          
         Mr. Jefferson.         

21:06.932 --> 21:11.735
    Now, Archie, all you owe    
      Mr. Jefferson is $1.      

21:11.737 --> 21:14.771
How do I owe him $1?            

21:14.773 --> 21:18.075
  No, Daddy, that's not right.  

21:18.077 --> 21:21.245
  No, that ain't right,         
little girl. Help me here.      

21:21.247 --> 21:22.746
    Daddy, you're forgetting    

21:22.748 --> 21:24.748
  about the $2 Mr. Jefferson's  
  still out for the cleaning.   

21:24.750 --> 21:25.916
        You owe him $3.         

21:28.286 --> 21:30.720
That ain't no help!             

21:30.722 --> 21:33.323
 She's right, Arch. You owe him 
      $3. Here, give me 5.      

21:33.325 --> 21:34.724
Wait a minute here!             

21:34.726 --> 21:38.395
Here, Mr. Jefferson. Here's $5. 
     Now you owe Archie $2.     

21:38.397 --> 21:42.266
 Well, at least he owes me $2.  
Somebody owes me something here!

21:42.268 --> 21:43.267
         Remember, now.         

21:43.269 --> 21:44.768
You owe me $2.                  
                      All right.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.969
All right, talking              
of owings, here,                

21:45.971 --> 21:47.371
what about the $5               
you owe me?                     

21:47.373 --> 21:49.572
I give you $5 last week,        
I loaned it to you              

21:49.574 --> 21:51.208
to buy pizza for yourself       
and Gloria.                     

21:51.210 --> 21:52.709
    Oh, that's right.           
    I forgot, Archie.           

21:52.711 --> 21:54.945
     Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.      
I forgot! I'm sorry!            

21:54.947 --> 21:57.047
    Gloria, could you give me   
         $5 to give to Archie?  

21:57.049 --> 21:58.681
Oh, sure, honey.                
Let me get my purse.            

21:58.683 --> 22:00.150
                ARCHIE:         
    Yeah, get the purse, huh?   

22:00.152 --> 22:03.220
No, wait a minute, Daddy.       
There's something wrong here.   

22:03.222 --> 22:05.488
  Yeah, there's something wrong,
         little girl, huh?      

22:05.490 --> 22:07.991
Yeah, you owe me 10.            

22:07.993 --> 22:11.528
            That's what's wrong?

22:11.530 --> 22:14.164
Yeah, don't you remember        
last week I loaned you $10      

22:14.166 --> 22:15.365
when you didn't                 
have enough money               

22:15.367 --> 22:17.734
to pay the plumber              
for fixing the drip in the sink?

22:17.736 --> 22:19.136
                Oh, holy cow.   

22:19.138 --> 22:21.338
Yeah. What have you got there?  
Two fives? There's my ten.      

22:21.340 --> 22:22.339
                  Wait a minute!

22:22.341 --> 22:23.840
  There's the five you wanted.  

22:23.842 --> 22:27.377
Thank you very much. Here's the 
five I owe you for the pizza.   

22:35.719 --> 22:37.054
We're all square.               

22:38.323 --> 22:40.690
Wait, wait.                     
Not quite all square.           

22:40.692 --> 22:42.792
             You're damn right  
        not quite all square.   

22:42.794 --> 22:46.463
 Remember, George, you still owe
    Archie $2. Give it to him.  

22:46.465 --> 22:47.697
         Yeah, somebody         
    give me something, huh?     

22:47.699 --> 22:49.599
 I'm feeling awful light here.  

22:49.601 --> 22:50.968
                Give him the $2.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.602
I don't have change.            

22:52.604 --> 22:54.237
I know how to fix this!         
                    ARCHIE: How?

22:54.239 --> 22:57.707
Michael, remember you and Daddy 
      still owe Lionel $7       

22:57.709 --> 22:59.309
for the ball game tickets       
      from last Saturday.       

22:59.311 --> 23:01.345
    That's right! I forgot.     

23:01.347 --> 23:02.645
Here, give me the $5.           

23:02.647 --> 23:04.681
         Wait a minute!         

23:04.683 --> 23:06.649
Mr. Jefferson, here's $5.       

23:06.651 --> 23:08.452
    Now, with the two           
        you owe Archie,         

23:08.454 --> 23:10.687
    you add that to the $5,     
         that makes 7.          

23:10.689 --> 23:12.089
    You give that to Lionel.    

23:12.091 --> 23:15.125
  That squares us with Lionel   
  and squares you with Archie.  

23:15.127 --> 23:17.727
     Everything's perfect.      
     Everybody's paid off.      

23:17.729 --> 23:19.296
GLORIA:                         
Michael, that's right.          

23:19.298 --> 23:22.466
      How is everybody paid off?

23:24.568 --> 23:28.805
I had $35 in my hand. I'm       
 standing here holding nothing! 

23:31.376 --> 23:33.977
    Now, don't nobody move!     

23:35.880 --> 23:39.816
  Because we're going to start  
  this whole transfaction over  

23:39.818 --> 23:43.720
  and we're gonna do it slow,   
 right from the very beginning. 

23:44.788 --> 23:46.023
                 All right.     

23:46.025 --> 23:48.425
 It all started when you gave me
          this phony 20.        

23:48.427 --> 23:50.793
    Now you've got it back. Bye.
          Come on, Louise.      

23:50.795 --> 23:52.095
      Goodbye, everybody.

You could have fooled me        
with this.                      

24:11.350 --> 24:13.650
I would never know              
how to tell the difference      

24:13.652 --> 24:16.553
between this                    
and a good $20 bill.            

24:16.555 --> 24:19.456
          Here, let me show you.
             Give me the bill.  

24:19.458 --> 24:21.158
         The difference is this.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.762
                A phony $20 bill
            is worth nothing.   

24:29.233 --> 24:34.604
             But a good $20 bill
                is worth $10.
