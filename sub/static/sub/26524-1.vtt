so much my hand is tired.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.503
My ears are sore.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.588
And my constitution
needs coffee.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.757
That's why I was
scratchin' around back there.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.385

Nice to meet you.

That's easy to remember.

The Immaculate Heart of Mary's

Well, let me just
say up front that myself

08:19.584 --> 08:21.186
and the good people
of East Biloxi Baptist...

08:21.210 --> 08:23.087
may have our differences
with your pope...

08:23.254 --> 08:24.630

we all carry

08:24.714 --> 08:27.216
the divinity of Jesus Christ
in our hearts.

08:27.383 --> 08:29.594
And that makes us brothers

09:10.259 --> 09:12.178

always like this.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.638

09:13.721 --> 09:15.361
you could find a clerk
come check-in time.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.099
No, no, no.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.582
I mean it was always
a bit of a novelty,

09:24.607 --> 09:26.025
yeah, sure, of course.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.610
But there's state fair novelty

09:27.693 --> 09:30.529
and then there's
old horse novelty.

09:30.613 --> 09:34.033
And I believe we are firmly
in the old horse variety.

09:35.326 --> 09:39.789
Yessir! 1966,
this place had swing.

09:39.956 --> 09:42.250
Hell, I don't even think
I could get a room here

09:42.333 --> 09:44.126
in the main lodge if I tried.

09:44.919 --> 09:49.590
It was a hidey-hole for
the Tahoe swells, you know?

09:50.758 --> 09:53.386
Old Dean Martin
even sang a song about it.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.263
"Half in California
with Judy."

09:55.596 --> 09:56.597
No?

09:56.973 --> 09:59.016
Well, wasn't one of
his best. Coffee?

09:59.183 --> 10:00.726
Oh, no, thank you.
Oh, come on, girl.

10:00.810 --> 10:03.688

10:03.854 --> 10:05.022

There you go.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.357

10:06.440 --> 10:08.567
I'll let the clerk
give you the whole spiel

10:08.651 --> 10:10.778
if he ever shows up again,
that is.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.530
But the thing
they always leave out...

10:12.613 --> 10:14.091
is that this place
lost its gambling license

10:14.115 --> 10:15.574
about a year ago.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.078
Something to do with
the commission or some such.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.998
So all the swells
took their business elsewhere.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.166
Now the main lodge
is all that's open.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.294
The pool is filled
with ducks. (CHUCKLES)

we're bein' honest...

10:33.592 --> 10:35.028
that's probably
the only reason that a priest,

10:35.052 --> 10:36.387
a vacuum salesman,
and a negro...

10:36.470 --> 10:38.889
could afford freight here,

is so important to me...

11:44.080 --> 11:49.168
No. But, I mean, this is not
a place for a priest, Father.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.170
You shouldn't be here.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.590

Father.

I could help you find one.

be happier there.

for a priest, Miles...

12:10.189 --> 12:12.525
then this is exactly
where the Lord wants me.

12:13.401 --> 12:16.195
Well, the Lord don't want you
in the honeymoon suite.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.488
I can promise you that.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.157
Miles, those are
my accoutrement there

12:20.241 --> 12:22.451
and I stake my claim
as such.

12:22.535 --> 12:24.096
But you can go ahead
and check them in first.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.496

(NERVOUSLY) The El Royale
is a bi-state establishment.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.147
You have the option to stay

12:51.230 --> 12:54.066
in either the great state
of California...

12:54.233 --> 12:57.278
or the great state of Nevada.

Between California
and Nevada?

13:13.919 --> 13:15.504
Between the rooms.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.381
Well, for starters,

13:17.465 --> 13:19.508
rooms in California
cost a dollar more.

13:19.592 --> 13:21.677
(WHISTLES) Really?
When did that happen?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.220
What makes 'em
a dollar better?

13:24.555 --> 13:27.057
They're in California.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.602
LARAMIE: And that's
worth a dollar?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.312
Some people think so.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.206
You got a phone number
for any of those people?

here at the hotel?

13:41.405 --> 13:43.532
Currently, that is also me.

Oh, well...

about that later.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.007
Only the main lodge is
available in the off-season.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.052
You could still use
the California amenities

14:03.135 --> 14:05.221
if you choose to stay
in Nevada.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.140
What exactly is
a California amenity?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.767
Uh, for instance,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.977
we're not allowed
to sell liquor in Nevada.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.145
So if we wanna drink,

14:13.229 --> 14:14.855
we gotta do it
on that side of the room?

14:14.939 --> 14:16.357
That is correct, sir.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.485
Also, coffee is
25 cents a cup.

another room available?

15:44.486 --> 15:45.904

near the priest.

and forgiveness and whatnot.

16:14.725 --> 16:15.809
Room five will be fine.

Oh, I live in Bakersfield now,

44:14.653 --> 44:16.822

singing in Reno tomorrow.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.532
Oh, that's exciting.

That's not exactly
the word I'd use

I'd be in the hole.

Ah.

44:39.511 --> 44:41.305

the same question sometimes.

How'd you end up
at the El Royale?

45:05.996 --> 45:08.582
I was visiting my brother
in Oakland...

45:08.665 --> 45:11.627

the road before dark.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.671

they're no good at night.

as much as a keno lounge?

a spotty memory...

would be

01:22:24.608 --> 01:22:26.610
to shoot the old man
in the face...

think that through.

soon enough...

and I don't want to be
the black woman

01:22:40.165 --> 01:22:43.043
in the woods at night
with a gun when they do.

01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.592
So then, I'd start thinking
about my other options.

01:22:50.675 --> 01:22:53.845
I suppose
I could go back in there...

01:22:53.928 --> 01:22:56.681

I'm not thinking that.

01:22:59.184 --> 01:23:02.520
Which leads me
to option three.

01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:09.319
Maybe I hear the old man out,
maybe he's telling the truth.

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:13.365
Maybe there really is money
buried in my room.

01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:16.201
Maybe the old man...

01:23:17.077 --> 01:23:19.829
he doesn't have
a lot of time left.

01:23:19.913 --> 01:23:25.418
He's fine with 50% of whatever
we find in that floor.

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:28.922
If I'm wrong, I can still
shoot him later, huh?

01:23:30.423 --> 01:23:32.384
But if I'm right...

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:35.720

BILLY: Huh.

01:46:08.447 --> 01:46:12.034
The kid told me, he films
people doing whatnot...

01:46:12.117 --> 01:46:13.994
and sends it to his bosses.

01:46:16.455 --> 01:46:18.290
Who are his bosses?

01:46:18.373 --> 01:46:22.127
(SCOFFS) People who own
the hotel. I don't know.

01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:23.920
Does it really matter?

01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:26.548
Maybe.
(SCOFFS)

01:46:27.841 --> 01:46:31.887
And what, he just offered
this up to you, did he? Hmm?

01:46:34.848 --> 01:46:37.267
I think he was
trying to confess.

01:46:39.978 --> 01:46:42.397
I think it's been
weighing on him.

01:46:42.481 --> 01:46:45.650
I think he's trying
to confess right now...

01:46:45.734 --> 01:46:48.320
because he knows how
this is gonna go...

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:51.907
and he fears for his soul.

01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:53.658

about your soul...

have been doing

in the first place.

asking you right now, Father.

the money come from, hmm?

01:48:04.146 --> 01:48:05.605

from, huh?

I earned it.
