00:07.900 --> 00:10.200
( <i>bell ringing )</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.980
( <i>whistle blowing )</i>

00:26.220 --> 00:31.500
( <i>playing the blues )</i>

00:35.130 --> 00:36.430
D-oh!

00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
( screams )

00:52.670 --> 00:55.740
Mmm, doughnuts.

00:59.670 --> 01:01.310
Hey, Homer, slow down.

01:01.370 --> 01:02.430
You're going to choke
or something.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.410
Don't tell me
how to eat doughnuts.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.280
( <i>choking )</i>

01:07.350 --> 01:08.780
Hey, Homer's
choking again.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.590
Isn't there
a first-aid chart

01:10.650 --> 01:11.590
around here somewhere?

01:11.650 --> 01:12.720
Somebody scare him.

01:12.790 --> 01:14.360
That's for the hiccups.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.930
Hey, look at this.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.060
Softball starts this week.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.630
Softball?

01:21.690 --> 01:23.990
Who's next?

01:24.060 --> 01:25.720
Count me out.
Not me.
No way.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.740
What's the matter
with you guys?

01:27.800 --> 01:30.070
Homer, last year
we were two and 28.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.510
Look, I know it wasn't
our best season.

01:31.570 --> 01:32.810
Actually, it was.

01:32.870 --> 01:34.010
Well, this year,
it's gonna be different.

01:34.070 --> 01:36.170
Oh yeah? What makes you
so damn sure?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.510
<i>I have a secret weapon.</i>

01:38.580 --> 01:41.420
Hey, he's been holding out
on us, huh?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.820
A secret weapon?

01:42.880 --> 01:45.290
I wonder what it could be.

01:51.690 --> 01:52.560
Hmm...

01:55.690 --> 01:56.920
( <i>laughing )</i>

01:57.000 --> 02:00.340
Count me in.
I'm there.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.540
Come here, boy,
I want to show you something.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.700
What's that?

02:02.770 --> 02:03.770
A homemade bat?

02:03.840 --> 02:05.270
It's something very special--

02:05.340 --> 02:07.040
a homemade bat.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.139
It all started last year

02:09.210 --> 02:10.610
<i>during a terrible thunderstorm</i>

02:10.680 --> 02:11.880
<i>when I locked myself</i>

02:11.940 --> 02:14.170
<i>out of the house.</i>

02:14.250 --> 02:17.090
<i>Sheltering myself with
a large piece of sheet metal</i>

02:17.150 --> 02:20.390
<i>I ran for cover under
the tallest tree I could find.</i>

02:22.960 --> 02:26.490
<i>Something told me
this was a very special</i>

02:26.560 --> 02:30.630
<i>very magical piece of wood
that I could make a bat out
of.</i>

02:30.700 --> 02:33.640
<i>I put my homemade football
on hold</i>

02:33.700 --> 02:37.270
<i>and set to work making
the world's greatest bat.</i>

02:37.340 --> 02:40.310
( <i>Homer grunting )</i>

02:44.680 --> 02:46.380
Homie, come to bed.

02:46.450 --> 02:48.020
( <i>Homer grunting )</i>

02:48.080 --> 02:51.920
Homer, go back
to the garage.

02:51.980 --> 02:54.450
And here it is.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.960
Wow! How many home runs

02:59.020 --> 03:00.550
you going to hit with that?

03:00.630 --> 03:04.730
Let's see, we play 30 games,
ten at bats a game-- 3,000.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.100
( <i>whistles )</i>

03:12.170 --> 03:13.540
Hit one here, Charlie!

03:15.040 --> 03:16.980
( <i>screams )</i>

03:17.040 --> 03:18.170
Okay, lets go over
the ground rules--

03:18.240 --> 03:20.670
You can't leave first
until you chug a beer.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.180
Any man scoring
has to chug a beer.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.650
You have to chug a beer at the
top of all odd-numbered innings.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.690
Oh, and the fourth inning
is the beer inning.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.250
Hey, we know how
to play softball.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.190
Umpire:
Play ball!

03:31.260 --> 03:32.930
<i>Attention all units!</i>

03:32.990 --> 03:34.360
<i>Attention all units!</i>

03:34.430 --> 03:35.730
<i>Armored car being robbed
at 5th and ...</i>

03:35.790 --> 03:37.260
Turn off that damn radio!

03:38.960 --> 03:41.230
Marge:
And the next man wants
to hit the ball too.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.500
And he does.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.440
There he goes off
in that direction.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.730
And everyone is happy.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.570
Mom, why don't you
let me call the game?

03:48.640 --> 03:49.980
That's alright dear,
I can do it.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.810
( <i>cheering )</i>

03:55.880 --> 03:57.650
Men, stop that!

03:59.380 --> 04:01.780
Okay, Homer, bases loaded,
and you're up.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.680
Where's that
secret weapon?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.260
Check it out, boys.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.920
My magic bat.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.250
That's it?

04:08.330 --> 04:10.600
Yeah, I got
a magic bat too.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.290
And I got
an enchanted jockstrap.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.640
( <i>laughing )
( <i>laughing )</i></i>

04:14.700 --> 04:15.870
Yeah. Just watch.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.150
( <i>screams )</i>

04:30.220 --> 04:32.050
Whoo-hoo!

04:33.820 --> 04:34.860
All right, homeboy!

04:34.920 --> 04:36.390
Yeah!

04:36.460 --> 04:38.690
( <i>taunting: )
Ha-ha! Cops can't win!</i>

04:38.760 --> 04:40.660
Get his license
and registration.
Right, Chief.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.670
Wow, Dad.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.700
Homer, can I get you a beer?

04:48.770 --> 04:51.240
No. I want
to get him a beer.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.200
Kids, kids,
you can each get me a beer

04:54.270 --> 04:57.670
but first, let's see it again
in super slow motion.

04:57.740 --> 05:00.840
( <i>sloshing noises )</i>

05:00.910 --> 05:03.170
Why you...

05:03.250 --> 05:04.420
Huh?

05:18.930 --> 05:20.470
All:
Ooh!

05:20.530 --> 05:22.860
Such a mighty wallop.

05:27.510 --> 05:29.940
I got my magic bat
off a piano.

05:30.010 --> 05:32.350
My sister let me use
her wooden leg.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.990
Smithers:
Good news, Sir.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.650
The plant softball team
has won again.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.930
If we beat Shelbyville
next week, we capture the
pennant.

05:44.990 --> 05:46.490
Did you hear that, Ari?

05:46.560 --> 05:49.700
My boys need only to
thump your tub,
and the title is ours.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.870
Ha!

05:50.930 --> 05:53.100
The Gladiators
from my power plant

05:53.170 --> 05:55.900
will crush your team
like nine flabby grapes.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.640
I disagree.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.760
Would you care to bet
a million dollars on that?

05:59.840 --> 06:02.310
Oh, if we're going to bet,
why don't we make
it interesting?

06:02.370 --> 06:04.400
What. A million dollars
isn't interesting to you?

06:04.480 --> 06:05.610
Did you say a  million?

06:05.680 --> 06:07.150
I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.140
I thought you would start
with a small amount

06:09.210 --> 06:11.280
and we would
bait each other, and...

06:11.350 --> 06:12.490
<i>you know how
it goes.</i>

06:12.550 --> 06:14.560
Yeah, certainly.
A million will be fine.

06:16.860 --> 06:19.760
Is it wrong to cheat in order
to win a million dollar bet?

06:19.830 --> 06:20.760
Yes, Sir.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.400
Let me rephrase that.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.900
Is it wrong if <i>I cheat in order
to win a million dollar bet?</i>

06:25.960 --> 06:27.930
No, Sir.
Who would you like killed?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.270
No, Smithers.

06:29.330 --> 06:32.600
I've decided
to bring in a few ringers--

06:32.670 --> 06:33.840
professional baseballers.

06:33.910 --> 06:36.340
We'll give them
token jobs at the plant

06:36.410 --> 06:38.850
and have them play
on our softball team.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.520
Honus Wagner, Cap Anson

06:40.580 --> 06:41.680
Mordecai
"Three Finger" Brown...

06:41.750 --> 06:43.020
Uh, Sir.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.820
What is it, Smithers?

06:44.880 --> 06:47.780
I'm afraid
all those players have retired

06:47.850 --> 06:49.510
and, uh, passed on.

06:49.590 --> 06:53.360
In fact, your right fielder
has been dead for 130 years.

06:53.430 --> 06:54.830
Damnation!

06:54.890 --> 06:57.160
Alright, find me some good
players-- living players.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.900
Scour
the professional ranks--

06:58.960 --> 07:01.160
the American League,
the National League

07:01.230 --> 07:02.430
the negro leagues.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.440
I'm on my way.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.770
Oh, and, Smithers..

07:04.840 --> 07:07.340
You have 24 hours.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.440
( <i>gulps )</i>

07:10.240 --> 07:12.410
( <i>whispering )</i>

07:12.480 --> 07:14.680
I get $50,000
to play one game?

07:14.750 --> 07:16.250
That's right,
Mr. Canseco.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.710
Well, it's a pay cut,
but what the hey.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.180
It sounds like fun.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.620
Uh... oh...

07:22.520 --> 07:23.390
( <i>gunshot )</i>

07:23.460 --> 07:24.390
Hey, sorry.

07:24.460 --> 07:26.060
I thought you were a deer.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.020
Oh, that's okay.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.530
Happens all the time.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.190
Are you Mike Scioscia?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.430
That's me.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.600
How do you like working
for the Dodgers?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.400
Well, it's okay

07:35.470 --> 07:38.170
but sometimes I wish I had
something a little more
blue collar

07:38.240 --> 07:40.740
you know, with big machines
and cool dials and stuff

07:40.810 --> 07:42.210
like an oil refinery

07:42.270 --> 07:43.670
or hydroelectric plant.

07:43.740 --> 07:44.950
We should talk.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.680
<i>And this is Elvis' rec room.</i>

07:47.750 --> 07:50.280
When the king wasn't rehearsing
or exercising

07:50.350 --> 07:53.750
he'd like to unwind by watching
up to three TVs at once.

07:53.820 --> 07:56.020
Man, oh, man,
what a lifestyle.

07:56.090 --> 07:57.530
Excuse me. Are you Ozzie Smith?

07:57.590 --> 07:58.530
Yes.

07:58.590 --> 07:59.930
I have a proposition for you.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.630
Hello. Are you Don Mattingly?

08:04.700 --> 08:05.700
Yes, I am.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.690
Come in.

08:06.770 --> 08:07.670
Can I get you something?

08:07.730 --> 08:08.760
What's your name?

08:11.670 --> 08:14.280
How would you
like to be a ringer

08:14.340 --> 08:16.480
on a small-town
company softball team?

08:16.540 --> 08:17.450
Would I?

08:18.910 --> 08:20.410
And now I'd like
to introduce the new members

08:20.480 --> 08:21.980
of our happy
power plant family.

08:22.050 --> 08:24.420
- Our new security guard,
Roger Clemens.
- Hello.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.710
Our new janitor, Wade Boggs.

08:25.780 --> 08:26.940
How you doing?

08:27.020 --> 08:29.090
Our lunchroom cashier,
Ken Griffey Jr.

08:29.150 --> 08:30.050
Hey, what's up, guys?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.560
Our new, well, uh

08:31.620 --> 08:34.120
we'll make up jobs
for these fellas later.

08:34.190 --> 08:37.120
Please say hello to Steve Sax,
Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry

08:37.200 --> 08:39.770
Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia,
and Jose Canseco.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.470
Ooh.
Geez.
Wow.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.390
By the way,
you new fellas

08:43.470 --> 08:45.340
there's a sign-up sheet

08:45.400 --> 08:47.370
for the company
softball team on the
bulletin board over there

08:47.440 --> 08:49.040
just in case you
wish to play.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.050
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

08:51.110 --> 08:53.180
Mr. Burns, with them
on the team, you won't need us.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.150
Well, <i>duh.</i>

08:54.210 --> 08:56.040
You, Scioscia, sign up.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.410
Thanks just the same.
But I'm here to run the solid
contaminate encapsulator.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.580
One more outburst like that

08:59.650 --> 09:01.890
and I'll send you back
to the big leagues.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.530
You're Darryl Strawberry.

09:05.590 --> 09:06.530
Yes.

09:06.590 --> 09:07.530
You play right field.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.650
Yes.

09:08.730 --> 09:09.860
- I play right field too.
- So.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.670
Are you better than me?

09:11.730 --> 09:15.000
Well, I've never met you,
but... yes.

09:15.070 --> 09:18.110
It's not fair.
Me and the guys
worked so hard to get

09:18.170 --> 09:20.910
to the championship game
and now we'll be sitting
on the bench.

09:20.970 --> 09:22.630
You hit so many
home runs this year.

09:22.710 --> 09:23.980
What makes you think

09:24.040 --> 09:26.170
this Darryl Strawberry character
is better than you?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.670
Marge, forget it.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.890
He's bigger than me,
faster than me,
stronger than me

09:30.950 --> 09:33.450
and he already has more friends
around the plant than I do.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.560
You make me sick, Homer.

09:35.620 --> 09:39.360
You're the one who told me
I could do anything if I just
put my mind to it.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.850
Well, now that you're a
little bit older,
I can tell you that's a crock.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.330
No matter how good
you are at something

09:44.400 --> 09:46.900
there's always about
a million people better than
you.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.900
Gotcha--
Can't win, don't try.

09:48.970 --> 09:52.410
As your new manager,
I want to say this up front--

09:52.470 --> 09:54.540
no one is assured
a spot in the
starting line-up.

09:54.610 --> 09:56.410
I don't care
if you're name is Steve Sax

09:56.470 --> 09:57.970
or Darryl Strawberry, or...

09:58.040 --> 09:59.840
Smithers, what's one of the
bad players names?

09:59.910 --> 10:00.980
Homer Simpson, Sir.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.720
Or Homer Simpson.

10:02.780 --> 10:05.520
Secondly, instead of beer,
from now on, you will all be

That's impossible.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.860
Hey, whoa!

18:47.920 --> 18:48.950
Ho, peanuts!

18:49.020 --> 18:49.950
Hey, peanuts!

18:50.020 --> 18:51.150
We got peanuts!

18:51.230 --> 18:52.260
Heads up!

18:52.330 --> 18:53.460
All right, Monty

18:53.530 --> 18:55.630
it's up to your
managerial skills.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.830
What to do--

18:56.900 --> 18:58.270
Smithers, massage my brain.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.390
Yes, Sir.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.740
Burns:
You, Strawberry--

19:03.810 --> 19:05.240
hit a home run!

19:05.310 --> 19:06.780
Okay, Skip.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.920
I <i>told him to do that.</i>

19:12.980 --> 19:14.150
Brilliant strategy, Sir.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.360
Ohhh!

19:18.420 --> 19:20.160
Marge:
Oh, dear!

19:20.220 --> 19:21.430
Hmm.

19:21.490 --> 19:22.830
Children, tell me

19:22.890 --> 19:25.630
when your father stops
scratching himself.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.430
Kids?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.100
We'll tell you, mom.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.060
Burns:
All right, tie game.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.160
Bottom of the ninth.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.370
Two outs, bases loaded.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
Strawberry coming up.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.040
<i>They're going to win</i>

19:39.110 --> 19:40.610
<i>the city championship.</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:42.350
<i>No thanks to me.</i>

19:42.410 --> 19:43.380
Wait.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.340
You! Strawberry!

19:44.410 --> 19:45.550
Good effort today.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.610
Take a lap
and hit the showers.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.850
I'm putting in
a right-handed batter
to hit for you.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.150
What? You're
pinch-hitting for me?!

19:51.220 --> 19:53.120
Yes. You see
you're a left-hander

19:53.190 --> 19:54.760
and so is the pitcher.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.720
If I send up a
right-handed batter

19:56.790 --> 19:58.630
it's called
playing the percentages.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.920
It's what smart managers do
to win ball games.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.930
But I've got
nine home runs today.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.870
You should be
very proud of yourself.
Sit down.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.190
Simpson!
You're batting for Strawberry.

20:07.270 --> 20:08.410
I am? Whoo-hoo!

20:08.470 --> 20:09.540
That a boy, Homer.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.730
You can do it.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.680
( <i>clucking )</i>

20:11.740 --> 20:12.880
All right, Simpson.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.950
Let's go over the signals.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.350
If I tug the bill
of my cap like so

20:17.410 --> 20:19.280
it means the signal
is a fake.

20:19.350 --> 20:22.720
However, I can take that off
by dusting my hands thusly.

20:22.780 --> 20:25.150
If I want you to bunt,
I'll touch my belt buckle

20:25.220 --> 20:27.120
not once, not twice,
but thrice.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.860
<i>Uh oh..I don't understand
a word he's saying.</i>

20:29.920 --> 20:32.550
<i>Why doesn't he
just let me bat?</i>

20:32.630 --> 20:34.670
<i>I wish I was home</i>

20:34.730 --> 20:36.970
<i>with a big bag
of potato chips.</i>

20:37.030 --> 20:40.070
<i>Mmm... potato chips.</i>

20:40.130 --> 20:41.090
Got that, Simpson?

20:41.170 --> 20:42.370
Yes, Sir.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.170
Now batting

20:44.240 --> 20:47.110
for Darryl Strawberry--
Homer Simpson.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.450
All right!
Yay!

20:48.510 --> 20:49.580
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!

20:58.220 --> 20:59.120
Huh?

20:59.190 --> 21:00.460
Ugh!

21:02.290 --> 21:03.160
( <i>wild cheering )</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:04.380
Oh, dear!

21:04.460 --> 21:06.600
No, Mom.
It counts as a hit.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.670
Dad just won the game.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.600
Well, I guess
he'll be happy

21:10.670 --> 21:12.640
when he comes to.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.840
We won! We won!

21:13.900 --> 21:15.170
