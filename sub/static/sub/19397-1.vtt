00:39.352 --> 00:40.483
Nick told me to talk to Geo.

00:40.488 --> 00:43.654
I'm Geo.
What can I get you?

00:46.071 --> 00:47.865
Seven hundred.

00:48.859 --> 00:50.584
Gotta get a lot more, though.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.748
A lot more meaning...

00:52.782 --> 00:54.356
A lot more.

00:54.407 --> 00:55.959
Do I talk to you
or someone else?

00:56.009 --> 00:57.893
No, just me.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.693
Why do you ask?

01:00.234 --> 01:02.334
Just want some
for the girls, you know?

01:02.651 --> 01:04.465
No, not really.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.799
Explain.

01:07.821 --> 01:09.949
Just wanted some for the girls.

01:09.954 --> 01:12.549
Well, forget it.
I'll just take 700...

01:12.554 --> 01:14.020
For now.

01:15.471 --> 01:16.738
For now.

01:21.049 --> 01:23.784
Police! Put your hands up now!

01:30.170 --> 01:31.732
Hold it!

01:32.416 --> 01:34.317
You're under arrest!
Hands!

01:35.196 --> 01:37.341
Hands! I want to see your hands!

01:47.491 --> 01:49.193
Nice job, Kate.

02:11.490 --> 02:13.228
You know I'm really
gonna miss your cooking.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.228
It's just my cooking
you're gonna miss?

02:15.233 --> 02:17.212
And you of course.

02:17.217 --> 02:19.715
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks.

02:23.815 --> 02:26.371
Hey, hey. Just water
for you, Missy.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.410
- Seriously? Mom!
- Water.

02:31.522 --> 02:37.058
Okay. Here is to an incredible,
exciting, and inspiring trip.

02:37.823 --> 02:39.535
Thanks, mom.

02:41.593 --> 02:44.728
You know, I'm really proud of you for doing
something generous with your summer.

02:44.733 --> 02:48.027
Most kids would be off partying
at an all-inclusive resort.

02:48.077 --> 02:51.480
Yeah, well, I'm not most kids.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.900
- Neither is Drew.
- I know.

02:53.905 --> 02:57.910
But can I just have one
paranoid mom/detective moment?

02:58.319 --> 03:00.025
Lay it on me.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.759
I need you to promise me
that you're gonna

03:01.764 --> 03:03.796
be extremely careful
when you're down there.

03:03.801 --> 03:08.244
I know how smart you are, but you and I
both know that Belize has its problems.

03:08.249 --> 03:09.463
I know.

03:09.468 --> 03:11.738
And you have my word
that I'll be careful.

03:11.850 --> 03:14.588
Besides, I'll be with Drew the whole time.
He knows his way around.

03:14.593 --> 03:17.488
He's been with the orphanage
for over a year now, so.

03:17.624 --> 03:19.324
It's all good.

03:19.405 --> 03:21.683
Okay. Dig in.

03:23.176 --> 03:24.761
It's really good.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.254
I love you, honey.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.316
Love you too, mom.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.918
I'll be okay!

03:40.533 --> 03:42.097
Okay.

03:42.997 --> 03:44.897
Let's dig in.

03:56.116 --> 03:57.955
Do you have that neck pillow
I got you for the plane?

03:57.960 --> 04:00.299
Yeah, and I'm forwarding you
the details of our hostels

04:00.304 --> 04:02.346
and travel itinerary as we speak.

04:02.351 --> 04:05.994
What can I say, I raised
an organized daughter.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.784
One second. Hey, baby.

04:09.020 --> 04:12.296
I'm good! Yeah, we're just waiting for
the car. It should be here in a minute.

04:12.301 --> 04:14.734
I can't wait to see you
either. I'm so excited.

04:14.739 --> 04:18.219
No! I told you, I'll just take a cab from
the airport and then I'll meet you there.

04:19.278 --> 04:21.178
Yes, I'm sure. I'm a big girl.

04:21.184 --> 04:22.462
Hey, let me talk to him.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.634
Oh, babe, mom wants to talk to you.

04:26.262 --> 04:28.304
- Hey, Drew!
- Hi, Miss Johnson, How you doing?

04:28.309 --> 04:29.827
I'm fine, thank you.

04:29.832 --> 04:32.244
I just want to tell you again
that I need you guys to call me

04:32.249 --> 04:33.843
right away if you have any issues.

04:33.848 --> 04:35.171
Ofcourse, Miss Johnson.

04:35.176 --> 04:36.251
Good.

04:36.256 --> 04:38.796
No time is too late, no
problem too small. Got it?

04:38.801 --> 04:40.101
Yeah, I... think he gets it, mom.

04:40.106 --> 04:42.939
- Take care of her.
- He will, mom.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.408
I love you, too, Drew. Bye!

04:52.005 --> 04:53.940
You have a great time, okay?

04:53.945 --> 04:57.001
Thanks, mom. I will.
You're the best, really.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.087
I'm so proud of you.

05:00.692 --> 05:02.586
I feel like a broken record.

05:02.591 --> 05:05.196
I never got a chance to do anything
like this when I was your age.

05:05.201 --> 05:07.843
I know and you know what? Next
time, you're coming with me.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.078
Video chat everyday.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.242
Everyday at 5:00 P.M. your time
and I'll be one hour behind.

05:11.247 --> 05:14.439
And lots of social media pictures
so I can live vicariously.

05:14.558 --> 05:16.048
Got it.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.809
I love you, mom.

05:17.814 --> 05:19.447
I love you, too.

07:20.487 --> 07:22.413
Good night, buddy.

07:36.007 --> 07:37.237
Come in.

07:37.242 --> 07:39.034
You wanted to see me, Captain?

07:39.039 --> 07:40.629
Yes.

07:44.968 --> 07:47.065
I wanted to congratulate
you on your work

07:47.070 --> 07:48.831
out in the field last night.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.300
Thank you, sir.

07:50.305 --> 07:54.606
I know we've been getting higher and
higher up the food chain with these guys.

07:55.124 --> 07:56.651
I think we're close
to the source now.

07:56.656 --> 07:58.299
Thanks to you and Marsden.

07:58.304 --> 08:00.088
That's good, Captain.

08:00.093 --> 08:02.331
Marsden is a great detective.

08:02.336 --> 08:03.829
I feel we're close, too.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.567
I hope so.

08:06.884 --> 08:09.496
Thanks, detective. You can go now.

08:12.952 --> 08:15.276
Sir, have you given anymore
thought to who's gonna replace

08:15.281 --> 08:18.121
Marsden as head of the narcotics
division when he leaves?

08:20.726 --> 08:22.996
Go back to work, detective.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.395
Yes, sir.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.020
This is Captain.

08:27.095 --> 08:29.230
Okay, send him in.

09:53.863 --> 09:56.672
All right, guys, come on!
Let's see what you've got.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.672
Oh! Nice shot!
Here you go, your turn.

10:00.873 --> 10:02.360
Oh!

10:03.228 --> 10:06.016
All right! You guys
keep playing, okay?

10:07.677 --> 10:09.053
Babe!

10:09.058 --> 10:10.767
Drew!

10:10.772 --> 10:14.048
Oh, gosh! Ah!

10:14.068 --> 10:16.312
- I can't believe I'm finally here.
- I know.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.147
- God, it's so good to see you.
- I know.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.185
- Here, let's take a selfie.
- Okay.

10:48.217 --> 10:50.954
June! Come meet
my girlfriend Nina.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.612
- Hey, Nina!
- Hi!

10:52.833 --> 10:57.056
- It is so good to finally meet you.
- It's good to meet you, too.

10:57.061 --> 11:00.017
Oh, you have such a good man here.

11:00.022 --> 11:02.267
And the kids love him so much!

11:02.272 --> 11:04.603
Kids, kids! Come on!
Come and meet Nina.

11:04.608 --> 11:06.088
Hi!

11:06.093 --> 11:08.700
Nina. Okay? Say, " Hello, Nina!"

11:08.705 --> 11:09.829
Hello, Nina!

11:09.834 --> 11:12.274
I see you've got
a few fans here.

11:12.279 --> 11:14.686
We're gonna head out.
Uh, just drive down the coast,

11:14.691 --> 11:16.086
show Nina this
beautiful country.

11:16.091 --> 11:18.883
Oh, okay then.
No problem. Well, have fun.

11:18.888 --> 11:20.430
And be safe, okay?

11:20.435 --> 11:23.305
- Thanks, June.
- Come on, kids. Come on. Come, come.

11:23.310 --> 11:26.284
- Bye!
- We gotta back up, come on. Come on.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.839
Bye!

11:35.131 --> 11:36.776
Bye!

12:42.143 --> 12:43.748
We're making a pit stop.

12:43.753 --> 12:45.215
Why? Where are we?

12:45.220 --> 12:48.203
This place is unlike anything
you've ever seen before.

12:49.171 --> 12:50.773
Let's go.

12:56.073 --> 12:57.310
Where are we going?

12:57.315 --> 12:59.609
You'll see. It's awesome!

13:00.639 --> 13:03.407
Gosh, there's so many stairs.
This better be good.

13:04.042 --> 13:05.664
What is this?

13:05.950 --> 13:07.476
- You'll see.
- Oh, my...

13:07.799 --> 13:09.425
Never get tired of this.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.929
Oh!

13:12.728 --> 13:13.883
And we can just jump in?

13:13.888 --> 13:15.295
Yeah. Let's jump in.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.933
Yeah, let's go!

13:17.695 --> 13:19.322
All right.

13:22.294 --> 13:23.838
Gosh.

13:25.786 --> 13:27.369
Ahh.

13:29.049 --> 13:30.697
Whoo!

13:46.560 --> 13:49.610
To say it's been an eye opener
is an understatement, honestly.

13:49.615 --> 13:52.298
Yeah, he's been at the
orphanage for four years now.

13:52.303 --> 13:55.102
Yeah. I can't leave the kids.
They're great.

13:55.107 --> 13:57.696
- You'll see.
- Yeah. I mean, I can already feel it.

13:57.701 --> 14:00.026
I can't wait to get started, guys.

14:00.177 --> 14:02.719
Most of them have lost or have
been abandoned by their families

14:02.724 --> 14:05.656
and have got nothing in
comparison to the kids back home.

14:05.661 --> 14:07.885
But they are so happy all the time.

14:07.919 --> 14:10.156
Grateful for all the
cultural riches, you know?

14:10.161 --> 14:11.688
There's a lot to say for that.

14:11.693 --> 14:14.979
I feel like I've changed just being here.

14:15.443 --> 14:17.300
I guess that's what happens
when you'reeverywhere else.

14:17.305 --> 14:20.322
In a place that's just
so different from outside.

14:20.872 --> 14:23.211
We focus so much on
material wealth back home.

14:23.216 --> 14:25.891
True. That's why we're lacking
depth in the western world.

14:25.896 --> 14:28.781
Honestly, I think it
should be mandatory

14:28.786 --> 14:32.360
for every privileged person
to spend at least a month

14:32.365 --> 14:34.954
in a third world
or a developing nation.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.197
Just to get perspective.

14:36.202 --> 14:39.408
To see
what it really means to be happy.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.008
Yeah, I get that.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.360
Hey, why not just stay
longer than just this summer?

14:43.365 --> 14:45.510
Oh, yeah, I wish.

14:45.716 --> 14:47.383
I start college as soon as I get home.

14:47.388 --> 14:50.336
Well, there's no reason you
couldn't if you really wanted to.

14:50.341 --> 14:51.556
College can wait.

14:51.561 --> 14:54.822
Yeah, we can use all the help
we can get in this orphanage.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.039
There's enough room for you.

14:57.044 --> 14:58.885
We'll see. I don't know.

14:58.927 --> 15:01.789
I just got here though,
so let's slow down a little bit.

15:01.794 --> 15:03.471
Yeah, true. True.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.401
All right, cheers!

15:19.068 --> 15:20.285
Hi, mom.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.720
Hi, honey. How are you?

15:21.725 --> 15:22.805
Oh, I'm great!

15:22.810 --> 15:26.742
We're at this incredible hostel in the
south of the country and it's so cool.

15:26.747 --> 15:28.375
It's a super chill atmosphere.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.781
We're staying here for a few days
before I start at the orphanage.

15:30.786 --> 15:32.643
That sounds so perfect.

15:32.677 --> 15:34.174
Are you on a hammock?

15:34.188 --> 15:37.156
Yeah, this is the life.
Here, I'll show you.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.410
I miss you. I wish
you could see this.

15:50.415 --> 15:52.149
I miss you, too.

15:52.154 --> 15:53.641
Oh, my God.

15:53.646 --> 15:55.266
What?

15:55.271 --> 15:58.312
Okay, so, there's this
total creeper here

15:58.317 --> 15:59.517
and it's actually really funny.

15:59.522 --> 16:01.102
I think he has a crush on me.

16:01.107 --> 16:02.774
Who is he?

16:02.779 --> 16:04.029
I don't know. It's fine.

16:04.034 --> 16:05.922
Then why is he just staring?

16:05.927 --> 16:08.799
Mom, shh! I think
he's a little slow.

16:08.841 --> 16:10.799
Trust me, not an issue at all.
It's okay.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.104
I think he's just
a little left of center.

16:13.927 --> 16:15.813
You know, I was thinking,

16:15.818 --> 16:17.955
I can see myself
staying here longer.

16:18.005 --> 16:19.850
Nina, you start college in the Fall.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.798
Yeah, I know but, you know,
they're actually saying

16:21.803 --> 16:23.336
they need more hands
at the orphanage.

16:23.341 --> 16:26.539
I don't know, that's pretty big.
Bailing on college?

16:26.544 --> 16:29.065
What, bailing? I didn't say bailing.
I'm just...

16:29.277 --> 16:32.701
I don't know, thinking about
putting it on hold for a bit.

16:33.271 --> 16:35.578
I don't know. We'll see.
I'm just thinking about it.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.400
Look, I understand that you're already
having a great time there, but...

16:38.405 --> 16:39.461
"a great time"?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.626
Mom, this is life-changing.

16:41.631 --> 16:42.733
I mean, you don't understand.

16:42.738 --> 16:46.164
I'm in a completely foreign country
where everything is new.

16:47.198 --> 16:50.008
There's so much we take for
granted back at home and I...

16:50.136 --> 16:53.412
I don't know, I want to stay here and
do my part to help out and learn.

16:53.417 --> 16:55.052
I understand that. I do.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.889
But I just think you should
think about this really hard

16:57.894 --> 17:00.138
before you start making
any promises to people.

17:00.143 --> 17:02.290
Your education
is very important.

17:02.339 --> 17:04.459
This is an education, mom.

17:04.464 --> 17:07.607
You don't understand. I'm just
thinking about it, okay? So calm down.

17:07.612 --> 17:09.185
Nina, come on!

17:09.190 --> 17:11.685
- Look, I gotta go.
- I love you.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.366
I know. They're waiting
for me inside. I gotta go. Bye.

17:14.371 --> 17:16.101
I love you.

18:58.282 --> 18:59.597
Nina.

18:59.602 --> 19:00.761
Hello?

19:00.766 --> 19:02.840
Nina. Honey, hi.
Can you hear me?

19:02.845 --> 19:04.472
Yeah, barely.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.183
- Are you okay?
- Ugh! I'm fine!

19:07.188 --> 19:10.129
Mom, I'm just... I can't
talk right now, okay?

19:10.134 --> 19:11.277
Are you drunk?

19:11.282 --> 19:13.560
Are you drunk?

19:13.595 --> 19:14.925
Listen, I have to go.

19:14.930 --> 19:17.051
We're doing this, like,
night jungle tourist thing.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.574
It's going to be really fun,

19:18.579 --> 19:21.426
so can you just cut
me a break, honestly?

19:21.431 --> 19:23.629
Honey, can we just
talk for two minutes?

19:23.634 --> 19:25.114
Hey, are you coming with us?

19:25.119 --> 19:27.150
Yeah, let's go.

19:27.618 --> 19:29.437
Nina.

19:29.548 --> 19:30.951
Hello?

19:31.023 --> 19:33.323
Oh, God. Come on.

19:41.497 --> 19:43.498
All right, just let her be.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.241
Cut her a break. She'll be fine.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.413
Yeah, she'll be fine.

20:07.853 --> 20:10.061
Let's crack this book open.

20:12.276 --> 20:13.670
Oh, we should do that.

20:13.675 --> 20:14.732
We went there!

20:14.737 --> 20:17.237
- No, we didn't. No, we didn't!
- Yeah, we did.

20:17.253 --> 20:19.630
- We were there already.
- We did that!

20:19.635 --> 20:21.942
- No, we didn't. Now, we didn't. No.
- Maybe we did it...

20:21.947 --> 20:24.677
These guys, they swam
with killer Piranhas.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.748
Crazy dudes.

20:25.753 --> 20:28.575
Oh, well that will not be us.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.630
We'll try and stay in the boat, Raf.

20:30.635 --> 20:32.623
Did I mention that we have
a safe aboard the boat

20:32.628 --> 20:35.036
to keep your valuables
and your passports?

20:35.041 --> 20:38.489
After all, you don't want to lose anything
or have them eaten by anacondas, do you?

20:38.494 --> 20:39.571
That's so nice of you.

20:39.576 --> 20:41.640
We'll have to go
wrestle them then.

20:41.645 --> 20:42.732
<i>Azeem</i>!

20:42.737 --> 20:45.311
Hey, Azeem! Let's get
another Belize special

20:45.316 --> 20:47.388
- for my new American friends.
- Yes?

20:47.393 --> 20:48.660
I am euro... from Europe.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.304
That's right. Make it
a double for euro trash.

20:52.424 --> 20:54.145
Euro trash!

20:54.150 --> 20:56.457
Euro trash, oh!

20:56.828 --> 21:00.196
- Cheers... to euro trash!
- Cheers!

21:26.811 --> 21:28.753
Are we in the jungle yet?

21:29.752 --> 21:31.675
Almost.

22:45.377 --> 22:49.782
What... Where...

22:49.978 --> 22:52.542
Wait. Wait, no!

22:52.547 --> 22:55.562
- Wait, what are you doing? Stop!
- No! No!

23:18.755 --> 23:20.355
How's Nina?

23:20.360 --> 23:21.960
She's great!

23:23.152 --> 23:24.780
I think.

23:25.692 --> 23:27.765
I haven't heard
from her yet today.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.732
We had an argument last night.

23:30.737 --> 23:32.904
She said she may delay
going to college

23:32.909 --> 23:35.405
so she can stay there longer.

23:35.557 --> 23:37.718
I guess I didn't
handle it that well.

23:37.744 --> 23:39.302
Well, that's understandable.

23:39.307 --> 23:42.904
I'm not sure I'd be comfortable allowing
my teenager even to go to Belize,

23:42.909 --> 23:44.021
much less stay there.

23:44.026 --> 23:45.943
She's a very mature young lady.

23:45.948 --> 23:47.216
I trust her.

23:47.221 --> 23:48.763
I'm sure she is.

23:48.768 --> 23:50.350
That does not take
away from the fact that

23:50.355 --> 23:53.819
Belize is the third most
dangerous country in the world.

23:53.846 --> 23:56.404
I know, I've read the UN Report.

23:56.409 --> 23:58.339
I'm just saying.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.709
Crime is a regular way of life
for many people down there.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.614
Drug trafficking is a real issue,

24:03.619 --> 24:05.718
especially now that
dead-end white collar crimes

24:05.723 --> 24:08.577
are going down there
to avoid prosecution.

24:09.397 --> 24:12.304
Come to think of it, you'd be
really good down there, Johnson.

24:13.689 --> 24:15.491
Hey, relax.

24:15.838 --> 24:17.138
She'll be fine.

24:18.474 --> 24:20.280
I'm outta here.

24:48.674 --> 24:49.888
Anschel?

24:49.893 --> 24:51.169
We have one.

24:51.174 --> 24:52.487
Give me the details.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.114
Anonymous.
Heart disease.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.013
- Will pay top dollar.
- Okay.

24:56.018 --> 24:57.804
Incoming tomorrow via Houston.

24:57.809 --> 25:00.382
Flight arrives at 12:15 your time.

25:00.627 --> 25:02.114
Should be to you by 2:30.

25:02.119 --> 25:03.723
- Okay.
- At the latest.

25:03.728 --> 25:04.849
Got it.

25:04.854 --> 25:07.346
Let go of me!
No, no! Stop!

25:07.351 --> 25:08.747
Video chat, everyday.

25:08.752 --> 25:09.858
Everyday.

25:09.863 --> 25:10.954
I'm okay.

25:10.959 --> 25:13.999
- Can you just cut me a break?
- Who is he?

25:42.109 --> 25:43.503
Hello, Jeanie's.

25:43.508 --> 25:46.448
Yes, I need to speak to one
of your guests, Nina Johnson.

25:46.453 --> 25:48.166
She's not here no more.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.409
She and her boyfriend
went without paying the bill.

25:50.414 --> 25:52.067
Do you know where she went?

25:52.072 --> 25:53.747
No idea.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.388
U.S. Embassy Belize.

26:04.393 --> 26:06.935
Hi, yes. I need to speak
to somebody about my daughter.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.941
She's traveling in Belize
and potentially missing.

26:09.946 --> 26:11.946
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

26:17.221 --> 26:18.474
It's Francisco.

26:18.479 --> 26:20.677
Hi, my name is Kate Johnson.

26:20.682 --> 26:24.567
My 18-year-old daughter, she has not
responded to me in over 24 hours.

26:24.572 --> 26:26.097
It's very unlike her.

26:26.102 --> 26:28.130
Uh, she missed our
scheduled phone call.

26:28.135 --> 26:30.327
And I've called the hostel
she was staying at,

26:30.408 --> 26:31.722
they said that
she checked out without paying.

26:31.727 --> 26:33.324
Also very unlike her.

26:33.329 --> 26:35.966
Well, Miss Johnson, I'm very
sorry to hear of your concerns.

26:35.971 --> 26:40.169
Um, the first thing I'll say is
that 24 hours on Belize terms

26:40.174 --> 26:42.614
isn't quite as long as it
feels like for you back home.

26:42.619 --> 26:45.458
<i>And, well, the Internet here
could be very spotty.</i>

26:45.463 --> 26:47.888
Yes, well, she has managed
to call me and text me

26:47.893 --> 26:49.794
on her scheduled times
from the hostel before.

26:49.799 --> 26:51.177
I understand.

26:51.182 --> 26:53.685
Look, it's not uncommon
for a young adult to get

26:53.690 --> 26:55.395
wrapped up in the fun
of traveling.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.091
They forget to touch base
with home because...

26:57.096 --> 26:59.819
It's completely out
of character for her.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.208
I'm a detective
in Florida, Mr. orizaga.

27:02.213 --> 27:04.989
And my daughter, she is
always very responsible,

27:04.994 --> 27:07.677
respectful, especially in
situations like this.

27:07.682 --> 27:09.286
Okay.

27:09.291 --> 27:12.099
Well, let me log this
and make some calls.

27:12.236 --> 27:15.560
Can I start by taking your daughter's
name and where she was staying?

27:15.565 --> 27:19.153
Nina Johnson. She's with her
boyfriend, Drew Hackett.

27:19.158 --> 27:21.825
At Jeanie's In, uh, Punta Dia.

27:21.830 --> 27:24.053
I also want to send you a screen-shot
of a strange man who has

27:24.058 --> 27:25.606
been following her
around the hotel.

27:25.611 --> 27:26.896
Look, um...

27:26.901 --> 27:30.069
What I can do is get in touch with the
local authorities on your behalf.

27:30.127 --> 27:33.013
Legally, the investigation is
in their hands only,

27:33.018 --> 27:35.849
but as you know, the Embassy
is here to assist you

27:35.854 --> 27:38.677
as citizens in Belize
as much as possible.

27:38.682 --> 27:42.400
So, can I start by taking
your details, Miss Johnson?

27:42.405 --> 27:44.638
Thank you, yes.

27:45.478 --> 27:46.872
Let us out!

27:46.877 --> 27:48.935
Hey! Let us out!

27:48.940 --> 27:50.435
You can't do this!

27:50.440 --> 27:51.614
Shut up!

27:51.619 --> 27:53.075
Just stop it!

27:53.080 --> 27:55.286
- No!
- What are we supposed to do?

27:55.291 --> 27:57.302
You're the reason we're
in this in the first place!

27:57.307 --> 27:59.177
Don't you dare try
to blame this on me!

27:59.182 --> 28:02.411
I told you those guys were shady
the moment I saw them in the bar!

28:02.416 --> 28:03.583
Stop!

28:03.588 --> 28:07.364
Can't both of you
just shut up and stop talking?

28:07.369 --> 28:11.364
Look, I don't know where we are
or why we're locked in here,

28:11.369 --> 28:13.670
but we're gonna have to pull
it together and figure out

28:13.675 --> 28:16.429
how we're gonna
get out. Okay?

28:40.121 --> 28:42.061
This is Francisco Orizaga.

28:42.066 --> 28:44.701
Hi, it's Kate Johnson.
Any updates on my daughter?

28:44.706 --> 28:46.664
Miss Johnson, I'm sorry, not yet,

28:46.669 --> 28:49.436
but I have spoken to
the police station in Punta Dia.

28:49.441 --> 28:52.014
Yes, I called two different
numbers I found online for them.

28:52.019 --> 28:53.944
One was disconnected,
the other rang out.

28:53.949 --> 28:57.522
Look, I advise you to be careful dealing
with the Belizean Police yourself.

28:57.527 --> 29:01.217
The system here isn't quite as advanced
as what you might be accustomed to.

29:01.222 --> 29:03.991
I completely understand that,
but I'm coming down there.

29:03.996 --> 29:05.576
I can't just sit here and wait.

29:05.581 --> 29:08.264
That may not be necessary
just yet, Miss Johnson.

29:08.269 --> 29:11.334
It's my job on behalf of the
Embassy to act as a conduit.

29:11.339 --> 29:14.930
I'm on the red-eye tonight. I arrive
at 7:20 A.M. tomorrow morning.

29:16.253 --> 29:19.159
Okay, I'll confirm a room
for you at the Imperial.

29:19.222 --> 29:21.616
It's where all the Foreign
Diplomats stay.

29:21.621 --> 29:25.524
I'll have a rental car dropped off
for you and I'll meet you there.

29:25.529 --> 29:27.695
Good. Thank you.

30:09.544 --> 30:11.697
Francisco?

30:11.895 --> 30:13.257
Hi. Kate Johnson.

30:13.262 --> 30:14.585
Good to meet you, Miss Johnson.

30:14.590 --> 30:15.926
Kate is fine.

30:15.931 --> 30:18.729
You're all checked in.
We can drop your bags first.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.572
- Follow me.
- Great.

30:24.606 --> 30:26.648
- Been here a while?
- I have.

30:26.653 --> 30:30.343
I was stationed here as a U.S.
Marine for five years, Special Ops,

30:30.348 --> 30:32.566
before taking this position.

30:32.762 --> 30:34.382
Yeah, most of
my family are here.

30:34.387 --> 30:36.499
Life as a Marine wasn't for you?

30:36.504 --> 30:40.501
General Saunders and myself, we clashed
on a few matters of procedure.

30:41.622 --> 30:45.671
Here's a general map of Belize and a
contact sheet of all primary services.

30:45.676 --> 30:47.570
Should help you get
your bearings.

30:47.575 --> 30:50.015
Thank you. Who's in
charge of Punta Dia?

30:50.020 --> 30:51.515
Who runs the place?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.882
Chief of police
is Sergeant Diaz.

30:53.887 --> 30:57.822
It's a small town, so if anything
happens, he should know about it.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.429
Look, you might find the local
authorities a little short with you.

31:00.434 --> 31:02.828
That's because they have
their hands full.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.749
Note taken.

31:04.754 --> 31:08.328
What's the status on the photo I sent you
of the strange man in Nina's hostel?

31:08.333 --> 31:09.765
Police have the photo.

31:09.770 --> 31:12.305
They are using it
for the investigation.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.812
Look, don't rub them
in the wrong way, okay?

31:14.817 --> 31:16.775
You need them on your side.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.593
What's Diaz's crew mostly
dealing with within the area?

31:19.598 --> 31:22.770
Drugs. Drug wars.

31:22.989 --> 31:27.781
Most recently, some cartel have expanded their
business into people and sex trafficking.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.695
It's been tough for the
authorities to stay on top of.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.226
Names of prominent cartels?

31:32.231 --> 31:34.538
Most well-knowns
are Los Huesos,

31:34.543 --> 31:37.767
Muerte Roja, and Diamante Negro.

31:37.973 --> 31:40.801
Who are the leaders
or any known spearheads?

31:40.934 --> 31:43.585
There's a smaller group
within Muerte Roja.

31:43.590 --> 31:47.274
They operate primarily
in and around Punta Dia.

31:47.403 --> 31:51.290
Look, Kate, this is extremely
dangerous territory, all right?

31:51.653 --> 31:55.115
Now I know you're a detective yourself,
but this is a different world.

31:55.239 --> 31:58.412
Leave the physical searching
down to the local authorities.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.923
I'll make sure
they're on the case.

32:01.442 --> 32:03.583
Look, if they don't
come up with anything new

32:03.588 --> 32:06.289
in the next 48 hours, I'll
take you to Punta Dia myself.

32:06.997 --> 32:09.392
I appreciate your concern.

32:09.497 --> 32:12.632
But let me remind you, this is
my daughter we're talking about.

32:12.778 --> 32:15.876
48 hours, I can't do. Sorry.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.334
I understand.

32:19.465 --> 32:21.015
I gotta get back to the Embassy.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.046
Thank you, Mr. orizaga.

32:23.051 --> 32:24.375
Francisco's fine.

32:24.380 --> 32:25.979
Francisco.

34:13.033 --> 34:14.741
Excuse me?

34:14.746 --> 34:16.379
Excuse me.

34:21.578 --> 34:23.312
What happened to you?

34:24.690 --> 34:26.324
They took it.

34:27.802 --> 34:29.592
Hi! Hello!

34:30.293 --> 34:32.077
Can I help you?

34:37.018 --> 34:40.491
Hello! Can I help you?

34:44.092 --> 34:45.594
Hello.

34:46.533 --> 34:49.293
Hey, I'm Kate Johnson.

34:49.299 --> 34:51.310
- Nina's mother.
- Hello! Yes.

34:51.315 --> 34:53.746
June. Have you spoken to her?

34:53.752 --> 34:55.560
They were supposed to be
back at work today.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.302
No, that's why I'm here.

34:57.307 --> 34:59.552
- I lost contact with her.
- Oh.

34:59.557 --> 35:03.265
Last time we spoke, she was about
to do a Jungle Tour in Punta Dia.

35:03.283 --> 35:04.653
Punta Dia?

35:04.658 --> 35:06.804
There are no Jungle Tours in Punta Dia.

35:06.809 --> 35:09.218
The rivers are too dangerous for that.

35:09.666 --> 35:11.804
Did something happen to her?

35:11.862 --> 35:14.039
That's what
I'm gonna to find out.

35:16.065 --> 35:19.241
That little boy,
with the scar...

35:19.604 --> 35:20.869
What happened to him?

35:20.874 --> 35:22.240
They took him.

35:22.393 --> 35:24.493
Who took him?

35:25.697 --> 35:29.108
Uh, can we walk
this way, please?

35:31.815 --> 35:34.819
They are the Muerte Roja.

35:34.846 --> 35:36.075
The cartel.

35:36.080 --> 35:40.460
They own everybody
and everything in Punta Dia.

35:40.916 --> 35:42.575
They took him.

35:42.674 --> 35:46.413
Left him in a field
with that scar.

35:46.424 --> 35:49.723
And his parents
were never found.

35:49.728 --> 35:51.460
So, he is here.

35:51.471 --> 35:52.661
Sector A?

35:52.666 --> 35:56.388
His father worked for sector A
at the tree hut cleaning dishes.

35:56.393 --> 35:58.179
The Tree Hut?

35:58.447 --> 36:01.179
That's where Nina was
the last time I talked to her.

36:01.213 --> 36:03.474
Did you go to
the police with this?

36:03.479 --> 36:05.435
The police need to
be told about this.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.364
I mean, she could be
with the same people.

36:07.369 --> 36:10.091
The police won't
help you with sector A.

36:10.096 --> 36:12.207
You do understand
that she's my daughter.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.029
And you need to understand

36:14.034 --> 36:16.896
that if the police find you
snooping around about sector A,

36:16.901 --> 36:20.474
they will kill you,
and then they will kill him.

36:20.479 --> 36:24.585
And if they have Nina and Drew,
they will kill them, too.

36:25.526 --> 36:29.154
Please. Stay out of this, Kate.

36:29.159 --> 36:33.075
Let the Embassy
find Nina and Drew.

36:33.080 --> 36:38.950
So that he... can enjoy
what is left of his life.

36:38.955 --> 36:42.466
Thank you, June, for all your help.

36:42.471 --> 36:44.716
I won't tell anyone
about the boy.

36:44.721 --> 36:46.187
Please.

36:46.448 --> 36:50.499
I hope you find her.
Drew is like a son to me.

36:51.565 --> 36:53.199
Goodbye, Kate.

38:10.774 --> 38:14.928
Hi. I would like to book the same room
that my daughter Nina Johnson stayed in.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.394
No one stayed here by that name.

38:17.399 --> 38:20.073
Can you check your books?
I think you're mistaken.

38:20.078 --> 38:21.519
It's spelled N-i-n-a...

38:21.524 --> 38:24.786
I said, no one stayed
here by that name.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.503
What's your name?

38:26.508 --> 38:28.378
- Gabrielle.
- Gabrielle.

38:28.383 --> 38:31.519
I recognize your voice from the phone.
We spoke yesterday, remember?

38:31.524 --> 38:33.823
You told me that Nina
checked out without paying.

38:33.828 --> 38:35.573
No.

38:35.578 --> 38:38.507
Okay, I will take whatever
room you have available.

38:38.512 --> 38:40.513
There is no more room left.

38:45.140 --> 38:47.966
I will take the room
that just became available.

38:48.375 --> 38:49.966
It is not clean yet.

38:49.971 --> 38:51.771
I'll wait.

39:43.718 --> 39:47.590
Excuse me, have
you seen this girl?

39:49.090 --> 39:50.823
Where is she?

39:53.680 --> 39:55.722
How about this man?

39:56.890 --> 39:58.831
Bobo. He fix.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.483
So he's maintenance.

40:00.488 --> 40:02.833
- Not here today.
- Okay.

40:02.838 --> 40:04.602
Bye.
Have a nice day.

40:04.607 --> 40:06.273
Thank you.

41:21.014 --> 41:23.216
Can I help you?

41:23.303 --> 41:26.329
Sergeant Diaz.
I hope so. Kate Johnson.

41:26.334 --> 41:28.094
Nina Johnson is my daughter.

41:28.099 --> 41:30.438
I believe you guys are tracking
her as a missing person.

41:30.443 --> 41:32.032
Can you talk to me about that?

41:32.037 --> 41:34.634
Listen, Miss Johnson,
we're working on the case.

41:34.639 --> 41:36.883
I'm afraid you'll
have to excuse me.

41:37.021 --> 41:40.196
I'm new here and we're trying
to get things in order.

41:40.201 --> 41:41.946
This station is very busy.

41:41.951 --> 41:44.337
I want to know where
you're at with the search.

41:44.373 --> 41:46.783
What the hell is going on here?
I tried calling this station

41:46.788 --> 41:48.141
and the number is disconnected.

41:48.146 --> 41:49.752
We're working on that. Listen,

41:49.757 --> 41:52.579
why don't you just go back to
your hotel and leave this to us.

41:52.584 --> 41:54.792
She is my daughter, Sergeant.

41:55.185 --> 41:57.969
Are you guys looking into the hostel
that her and her boyfriend stayed at?

41:57.974 --> 42:00.571
Jeanie's? There's something
really weird going on there.

42:00.576 --> 42:02.321
- We're working on it.
- No, look.

42:02.326 --> 42:05.149
They keep changing their story
about Nina and Drew.

42:05.154 --> 42:07.284
First they say that they
checked out without paying.

42:07.289 --> 42:09.352
Now they're saying they
didn't even stay there.

42:09.357 --> 42:12.134
And the maintenance guy Bobo,
what do you know about him?

42:12.139 --> 42:14.126
Bobo Carmine?

42:14.131 --> 42:17.813
He's harmless. He's not
the smartest man, but he's fine.

42:17.818 --> 42:18.969
Listen...

42:18.974 --> 42:21.337
We're in the process of
trying to find your daughter.

42:21.342 --> 42:24.448
I have work to do. Good day.

42:35.912 --> 42:37.754
Hi, it's Kate.
I'm in Punta Dia.

42:37.759 --> 42:39.571
What? You went there alone?

42:39.576 --> 42:41.990
Yes. I just met Diaz.
He gave me nothing.

42:41.995 --> 42:43.524
Kate, what are you doing?

42:43.529 --> 42:47.368
I also met a boy who had just been cut open
and looked like he had been stitched back up

42:47.373 --> 42:51.268
around the kidney area. He told me
somebody stole something from him.

42:51.273 --> 42:52.737
Hello?

42:52.818 --> 42:54.924
Yeah, I'm here. Sorry.

42:55.474 --> 42:58.729
Look, Kate, what I'm about to tell
you is in complete confidence.

42:59.287 --> 43:02.509
This is a highly sensitive case,
and if anything were to get out,

43:02.514 --> 43:04.673
it could compromise
the investigation.

43:04.678 --> 43:06.188
Just tell me.

43:06.193 --> 43:08.259
In the past, some
of the cartels became involved

43:08.264 --> 43:11.628
in illegal organ
and body part trafficking.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.571
The boy you saw, he may
have had a kidney removed.

43:14.576 --> 43:16.157
Go on.

43:16.162 --> 43:18.485
There are only a handful
of cases reported.

43:18.490 --> 43:21.391
We thought the Belizean authorities
had largely cleared it up

43:21.396 --> 43:24.071
and the main groups involved,
they were all shut down.

43:24.076 --> 43:26.714
Apparently not.
That boy's scar was fresh.

43:26.803 --> 43:28.509
Kate, let the police
do their work.

43:28.514 --> 43:29.947
Diaz knows what he's doing.

43:29.952 --> 43:31.650
I don't want you to get
involved anymore because

43:31.655 --> 43:33.330
if you do, you risk putting yourself in

43:33.335 --> 43:35.204
a very vulnerable,
life-threatening position,

43:35.209 --> 43:36.923
and that is no use to your daughter.

43:36.928 --> 43:39.964
I'll be doing everything I can
to bring my daughter home.

44:00.140 --> 44:02.956
Bobo. Bobo?

44:03.045 --> 44:04.841
Bobo.

44:04.846 --> 44:07.213
It's okay.
It's okay.

44:07.850 --> 44:09.423
Help me.
Can you help me?

44:09.428 --> 44:12.128
This is you. Yes, it's you?

44:12.170 --> 44:14.150
Yes? Good.

44:14.155 --> 44:16.822
This is my daughter Nina.
You know Nina?

44:16.827 --> 44:19.204
She's my daughter.
Do you know where she went?

44:19.209 --> 44:22.048
I don't know. I don't know.
I... I did not hurt her.

44:22.053 --> 44:24.383
Okay, I understand
you didn't hurt her.

44:24.388 --> 44:26.385
Do you know where she went?

44:26.577 --> 44:28.892
Please, Bobo. Look at me.

44:28.897 --> 44:30.501
Where did Nina go?

44:30.506 --> 44:33.558
I don't know.
She's... Nina is a... a nice girl.

44:33.584 --> 44:35.048
- Yes.
- A nice girl.

44:35.053 --> 44:38.077
Can I... can I go
to dinner with Nina?

44:38.116 --> 44:40.330
No. No, you don't... you can't
got to dinner with Nina.

44:40.335 --> 44:42.646
Nina is missing, okay?

44:42.651 --> 44:44.751
You... Bobo, please
tell me where she is.

44:44.756 --> 44:45.948
Do you know where she went?

44:45.953 --> 44:47.939
Uh... with her
boyfriend and Albert.

44:47.944 --> 44:51.681
- Albert? Bobo, who is Albert?
- He's a... a man.

44:51.686 --> 44:54.478
He's, uh, white.
S... silly voice.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.259
Is he an old man or a young man?

44:56.264 --> 44:59.915
He's a young man.
Healthy young man.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.164
Where did Albert go?

45:01.169 --> 45:04.980
- I... uh...
- Bobo, where did Albert go?

45:04.985 --> 45:07.958
They... they go
to Punta Dia and...

45:07.963 --> 45:11.245
And the tree...
Tree hut.

45:11.272 --> 45:13.657
You haven't seen them since when?
You don't know where they are?

45:13.662 --> 45:15.259
I don't know, no.

45:15.264 --> 45:19.081
Okay, Bobo.
Thank you, thank you.

45:41.024 --> 45:42.234
Drink?

45:42.239 --> 45:44.351
Yeah, beer please. Local.

45:44.356 --> 45:46.933
You like our Belizean beer, huh?

45:46.989 --> 45:51.392
Yeah, well. I like to do as
the locals do in their country.

45:51.403 --> 45:52.879
Where are you visiting from?

45:52.884 --> 45:54.650
Florida.

45:56.390 --> 45:58.803
Little break from
the hustle-bustle, you know?

45:58.808 --> 46:00.622
How about you?
Where are you from?

46:00.627 --> 46:02.294
I'm from here.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.016
Born and raised, huh?

46:04.021 --> 46:06.155
Well, it's a nice town.

46:07.581 --> 46:09.548
What happened to your face?

46:10.237 --> 46:12.103
I fell.

46:15.169 --> 46:18.306
Hey, have you
happened to see my friends?

46:19.452 --> 46:20.931
No.

46:22.528 --> 46:24.765
No big deal. They're just
some friends of mine.

46:24.770 --> 46:27.656
I heard they were traveling here, too.
Thought I'd meet up with them.

46:27.661 --> 46:29.860
But I actually
prefer to travel solo.

46:29.865 --> 46:33.267
What can I get you, sir?
Yeah, can I get a beer, please?

46:51.710 --> 46:53.830
That one.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.334
Help!
Please, help! Help!

47:36.565 --> 47:39.523
Please, Nina, Drew, help!

49:52.726 --> 49:55.174
- Hey, Azeem.
- Hi, ma'am.

49:55.179 --> 49:57.650
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

49:57.655 --> 49:59.236
Couldn't sleep.

49:59.241 --> 50:01.030
What do you think
is fun around here?

50:01.035 --> 50:03.871
I kind of want to get out
on an adventure tomorrow.

50:04.944 --> 50:06.472
Oye!

50:08.374 --> 50:10.408
Looking for a tour or something?

50:10.413 --> 50:14.308
Yeah, I kind of want to
get out and see some nature.

50:27.311 --> 50:29.799
Come around tomorrow,
around 9:00 A.M.

50:29.804 --> 50:32.449
There's a Jungle Tour leaving
around that time in the morning.

50:32.491 --> 50:37.261
Wow! That sounds great. Okay,
I'll see you in the morning.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.839
- This is Francisco.
- Francisco...

50:57.844 --> 51:03.137
There's a probable link between organ
theft, Muerte Roja, and the Tree Hut.

51:03.156 --> 51:05.585
It's where Nina and Drew
were before they went missing.

51:05.648 --> 51:07.956
- Go on.
- I'm going there tomorrow morning.

51:07.961 --> 51:10.682
9:00 A.M. I'm gonna retrace
my daughter's steps.

51:10.687 --> 51:13.714
I'm going to take the same Jungle Tour I
know she took and I'm doing it undercover.

51:13.719 --> 51:15.190
Hold on, you can't do that.

51:15.195 --> 51:17.440
- Well, I'm doing it.
- Kate, listen to me.

51:17.445 --> 51:20.043
These people are ruthless
and very dangerous, all right?

51:20.048 --> 51:23.135
They've historically paid the police
off to keep their mouths shut.

51:23.140 --> 51:25.221
Yeah, big surprise, what else?

51:25.226 --> 51:27.175
The body of a young man
was found today

51:27.180 --> 51:30.053
floating on the top
of the Belize Blue Hole.

51:30.058 --> 51:33.026
His body was weighted,
but apparently insufficiently.

51:33.930 --> 51:36.677
The heart and pancreas
were missing.

51:36.682 --> 51:39.316
His name was Albert Ingersson.

51:42.883 --> 51:44.589
Kate, listen, The Embassy's

51:44.594 --> 51:46.565
now working with
The Police Commissioner, okay?

51:46.570 --> 51:48.456
How could you not call me
with this immediately?

51:48.461 --> 51:50.823
Because I knew you would
do something crazy,

51:50.828 --> 51:52.823
which it sounds like
you're about to do now anyway.

51:52.828 --> 51:55.590
Nina and Drew were
with Albert Ingersson.

51:55.648 --> 51:58.505
Okay, don't do anything
until I get there.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.467
I'll be there tomorrow.

53:08.522 --> 53:10.581
Oh, my God.

53:23.101 --> 53:25.208
What's going on down here?

55:08.755 --> 55:10.837
Be right back.

55:15.615 --> 55:18.004
Yeah? -Hey, it's Anschel.
Good news.

55:18.340 --> 55:21.953
Great. -We have a match, and
we have an organ ready to go.

55:21.958 --> 55:24.117
- Tomorrow. P.M.
- okay.

55:24.122 --> 55:26.335
As soon as we get confirmation
on the money transfer,

55:26.340 --> 55:28.148
we can transport him
into surgery.

55:28.153 --> 55:29.949
Fine. Within the hour.

55:29.954 --> 55:31.564
Good.

55:34.801 --> 55:36.876
- Hi.
- Morning, Azeem.

55:37.051 --> 55:38.741
Just orange juice for me, please.

55:38.746 --> 55:40.939
Sure. Coming right up.

55:42.008 --> 55:43.642
Hi there.

55:43.965 --> 55:45.624
Welcome to Punta Dia.

55:45.629 --> 55:48.847
My name is Rafael. What's
your name, pretty lady?

55:49.083 --> 55:51.476
- I'm Melissa.
- Melissa.

55:51.481 --> 55:52.882
That's a beautiful name.

55:52.887 --> 55:54.695
So, Melissa from America

55:54.700 --> 55:57.209
is interested in
a Jungle Tour, yes?

55:57.214 --> 55:59.937
Please take a look inside
and see if you find anything

55:59.942 --> 56:02.628
that will stimulate
the adventuress in you.

56:02.903 --> 56:05.130
Wow, this is incredible.

56:05.270 --> 56:07.430
- Even monkeys?
- Different species.

56:07.435 --> 56:09.898
You get to see them all,
if you're lucky.

56:09.903 --> 56:11.421
How much is it?

56:11.426 --> 56:14.766
50 U.S. dollars,
but for you, 40.

56:14.771 --> 56:19.023
It seems like beauty has gotten
the best of my generosity.

56:19.028 --> 56:22.632
How long does that take? -I'll have
you back in Punta Dia by sunset.

56:22.637 --> 56:24.413
And yet, you'll have
enough time in the jungle

56:24.418 --> 56:27.429
to see everything that will
blow your mind for a lifetime.

56:27.434 --> 56:29.021
Wow.

56:29.075 --> 56:33.197
Azeem, let's get the Belizean special
for this fine American lady.

56:33.395 --> 56:34.671
Coming up.

56:34.676 --> 56:36.184
Oh, what's that?

56:36.189 --> 56:38.025
You like rum, yes?

56:42.068 --> 56:43.704
Thank you.

56:43.872 --> 56:45.556
Please, enjoy.

56:45.738 --> 56:47.504
- Excuse me one moment.
- Okay.

57:05.392 --> 57:07.483
Wow, that went down fast.

57:08.532 --> 57:09.973
You like it, huh?

57:09.978 --> 57:11.455
Mmm.

57:11.650 --> 57:14.450
These guys, they swam
with Killer Piranhas.

57:14.455 --> 57:15.684
Crazy dudes.

57:15.689 --> 57:17.098
That is crazy.

57:17.103 --> 57:19.497
Oh, did I mention that
we have a safety deposit box

57:19.502 --> 57:23.199
aboard the vessel to keep your valuables
and your passport, if you want.

57:23.204 --> 57:26.640
After all, you don't want them to
be eaten by anacondas, do you?

57:26.645 --> 57:29.553
No! Okay, here.

57:29.661 --> 57:31.874
Thank you.

57:32.954 --> 57:35.639
Wow, that drink was
really strong.

57:36.525 --> 57:39.137
Melissa, I'd like you
to meet Antoine.

57:39.142 --> 57:42.577
- Hi, Antoine.
- He's one of my best guys.

57:42.619 --> 57:45.733
Together, we do the best
Jungle Tour in all of Belize.

57:46.696 --> 57:48.616
Bobo.

57:49.556 --> 57:54.306
I'll get a... a virgin
tropical, uh, sun... sunshine.

57:54.498 --> 57:56.598
Coming right up, buddy.

57:57.311 --> 57:59.476
Well, you had me at "monkeys".

58:00.221 --> 58:02.638
- I'm in.
- All right.

58:02.643 --> 58:05.388
A lady that knows
what she wants.

58:05.393 --> 58:07.130
I have my truck parked outside.

58:07.135 --> 58:08.937
It will take us
down to the river.

58:09.018 --> 58:10.756
Come this way, please.

58:11.010 --> 58:12.851
Okay.

58:30.277 --> 58:32.812
Bobo!

58:51.362 --> 58:53.781
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:54.174 --> 58:56.334
How are you?

58:56.432 --> 58:59.709
Let me guess,
looking for the gringo, right?

58:59.714 --> 59:02.351
Maybe. What makes
you say that?

59:03.511 --> 59:06.085
Yeah, a gringo
called Kate Johnson.

59:07.325 --> 59:09.984
- No.
- No, what?

59:10.962 --> 59:13.963
- Don't know.
- You don't know what?

59:13.971 --> 59:17.880
Look, I don't know anything
about anything, okay?

59:17.885 --> 59:19.991
Fantastic.

59:20.073 --> 59:23.937
Thank you.
You're great help.

59:36.456 --> 59:38.157
Mister!

59:39.192 --> 59:41.656
Uh, m... mister!

59:55.487 --> 59:57.929
You must be Bobo!

59:57.987 --> 59:59.865
Yeah, Bobo.

01:00:01.668 --> 01:00:03.489
Have you seen something?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.830
Mm...

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:08.804
It's all right, man,
you can tell me.

01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:13.310
The mother
and the... the daughter.

01:00:13.315 --> 01:00:14.636
Yeah.

01:00:14.641 --> 01:00:16.710
You seen 'em?

01:01:16.242 --> 01:01:20.374
Yeah, this is Orizaga. I need
you to send the authorities.

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:24.406
I'm on the east bank river
five miles north of Punta Dia.

01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:27.445
Yeah. Okay.

01:02:51.437 --> 01:02:53.676
Wait one moment, lady.

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:57.730
Please, give me the gun.

01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:04.019
I said, "give me the gun!"

01:03:09.538 --> 01:03:12.074
Thank you. Get in!

01:04:05.265 --> 01:04:07.512
Ow, ow.

01:04:07.899 --> 01:04:10.301
- Aah!
- Hey!

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.449
I need her inside in one piece.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.033
- Drew!
- Kate!

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.644
- Oh, my God!
- Stay.

01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:44.115
Drew. Drew,
where's Nina?

01:04:44.374 --> 01:04:46.379
Where's Nina?

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:48.619
The doctor took her to the
room at the end of the hall.

01:04:48.624 --> 01:04:52.033
Why? What is going on here?
What are they doing to her?

01:04:52.038 --> 01:04:55.150
They're going to kill her
for her organs.

01:04:55.155 --> 01:04:58.416
It's what they did to Albert, and i...
I heard them talking in Spanish,

01:04:58.421 --> 01:05:00.732
and they have a buyer ready now!

01:05:01.034 --> 01:05:03.670
We need to go get her!

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.953
Grab the keys!
Drew, the keys!

01:07:01.965 --> 01:07:04.098
Let's get the body
under the mattress.

01:07:09.095 --> 01:07:10.328
Okay.

01:07:17.354 --> 01:07:19.067
Go.

01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:56.182
Stop!

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:57.739
What are you doing in here?

01:07:57.744 --> 01:07:59.635
I'm taking my daughter back.

01:07:59.685 --> 01:08:01.284
- Mom.
- I'm here, sweetheart.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.415
Hey!

01:08:16.261 --> 01:08:20.027
Get these two out of here.
You stupid morons!

01:08:40.772 --> 01:08:42.434
Get in there.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.745
Okay? Y'all don't wanna run.

01:08:52.975 --> 01:08:54.810
What you looking at?

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:00.870
You stay here.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.649
What?

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:22.596
- Nothing.
- I heard gunshots.

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:25.245
What? -I hope you were
not target practicing.

01:09:25.475 --> 01:09:28.206
- No, the woman...
- The woman?

01:09:28.233 --> 01:09:31.002
The woman and the kid got out,
but we got it under control now.

01:09:31.008 --> 01:09:33.479
How did you let
that happen, idiota?

01:09:34.826 --> 01:09:36.550
Look, if this ever
happens again,

01:09:36.555 --> 01:09:38.149
I'll personally kill you.

01:09:38.154 --> 01:09:40.086
- Sí, Jefe.
- And your family.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:42.979
- Sí, Jefe.
- Do we understand each other?

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:45.295
Sí, sí.

01:09:45.573 --> 01:09:46.808
Sí.

01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:54.887
You, go up front.

01:09:54.892 --> 01:09:57.342
Okay, boss.

01:10:04.822 --> 01:10:07.526
Do you really think I'm gonna
let you murder my daughter?

01:10:07.531 --> 01:10:09.709
You can't stop us.

01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:12.530
Back off!

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.084
You guys okay?

01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:36.075
Yeah.

01:10:37.306 --> 01:10:39.302
You guys go left.
That way.

01:10:52.193 --> 01:10:53.794
Stop!

01:11:10.502 --> 01:11:13.164
- It's me.
- You guys okay?

01:11:13.198 --> 01:11:15.084
Yeah, we gotta move.

01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:18.610
The others would've heard that shot by now.
They'll be here any minute.

01:11:22.414 --> 01:11:24.395
Come on, honey.
Let's move.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.656
We gotta move.
Come on, honey.

01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:28.297
Come on, let's move.

01:11:36.562 --> 01:11:38.844
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

01:11:52.903 --> 01:11:54.962
Okay, come on.

01:12:00.653 --> 01:12:02.687
- Go faster.
- Go!

01:12:03.522 --> 01:12:05.056
Into the jungle, come on.

01:12:17.836 --> 01:12:19.701
The main road is
about a mile ahead.

01:12:19.706 --> 01:12:21.603
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:12:21.608 --> 01:12:23.371
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:24.939
Go, go. Make a left.

01:12:24.944 --> 01:12:28.443
Go. -Go, go! The main road
should be a mile ahead.

01:12:28.448 --> 01:12:29.845
Keep going.

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.383
He's coming.

01:12:50.136 --> 01:12:52.537
No!

01:12:52.573 --> 01:12:54.305
No! No! No!

01:13:00.155 --> 01:13:02.198
- No! No! No! No!
- I know, honey.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.025
- No!
- Come on.

01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:05.580
- Drew! No!
- Honey.

01:13:05.585 --> 01:13:07.547
I'm sorry, we gotta go.

01:13:07.552 --> 01:13:10.513
Come on! We gotta go! -Get her outta
here. Get her outta here. Go! Go!

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:11.853
- Come on.
- Drew!

01:13:11.858 --> 01:13:14.725
- Go! Go!
- No!

01:13:24.577 --> 01:13:27.079
We gotta keep moving.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.479
Let's go! Go, go, go!

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.134
What are you doing?

01:13:34.139 --> 01:13:36.235
- Keep going.
- I'm not leaving without you.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.639
Get her out of here.
Trust me, I got this.

01:13:38.644 --> 01:13:40.143
Move.

01:13:41.494 --> 01:13:43.776
Go! Go, go, go!

01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:04.823
I'll kill you.

01:14:07.733 --> 01:14:09.690
You're gonna die!

01:14:17.589 --> 01:14:19.940
I'll kill you!

01:14:26.998 --> 01:14:28.941
Get off me!

01:14:32.671 --> 01:14:35.300
- No!
- -Don't do it!

01:14:37.476 --> 01:14:40.792
Run! Leave me!
Get her out of here! Go!

01:14:41.213 --> 01:14:43.381
Go! Go!

01:14:58.697 --> 01:15:03.449
You really thought I would make some
stupid woman cost me 20,000 bucks.

01:15:06.205 --> 01:15:08.128
Walk!

01:15:26.592 --> 01:15:28.837
- Lock the mother inside.
- In the Van?

01:15:28.842 --> 01:15:30.118
Yes, in the Van.

01:15:30.123 --> 01:15:32.760
You let them escape twice
from the cell, remember?

01:15:35.873 --> 01:15:38.844
No, no, no. Don't take
her, please, take me.

01:15:38.849 --> 01:15:41.008
- Take me instead, please.
- Oh, no.

01:15:41.013 --> 01:15:43.340
It doesn't work that way, lady.

01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:47.807
But don't worry, I'll make sure that
we find yours a good home, too.

01:15:48.099 --> 01:15:50.033
- Let's go.
- No, no, no.

01:15:50.038 --> 01:15:51.823
Take me! Take me!

01:15:56.288 --> 01:15:59.056
Let go of me! Mom!

01:16:25.463 --> 01:16:26.922
Dammit!

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.331
Dr. Anschel, we have the girl.

01:16:44.482 --> 01:16:46.537
Who is this woman?

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.745
What are you gonna do now?

01:17:00.014 --> 01:17:02.659
- Lock her up.
- Come here.

01:17:07.359 --> 01:17:09.008
- Oh, my God.
- Mom...

01:17:09.013 --> 01:17:11.211
Mom, I'm so sorry.
I should've listened to you.

01:17:11.216 --> 01:17:13.048
No, no, it's okay, honey.

01:17:13.053 --> 01:17:15.049
I'm going to get us
out of here, okay?

01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:18.179
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:17:18.184 --> 01:17:20.081
Mom, Drew's gone.

01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:23.846
Oh, my God. -I know. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:29.354
Honey, listen. Listen to me. Listen to me,
we have to focus on getting out of here.

01:17:29.539 --> 01:17:31.854
I'm so sorry.

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.252
It's okay.

01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:40.245
Sí.

01:17:41.012 --> 01:17:42.346
Okay.

01:17:43.185 --> 01:17:46.565
Bueno. Gracias.

01:17:49.235 --> 01:17:51.666
- What did they say?
- We gotta keep 'em here.

01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:54.985
They're sending another doctor.
This is worth a lot of money, man.

01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:58.025
Get the girl. Strap her to the
operating table and put her to sleep.

01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:59.616
The doctor will be here in 20 minutes.

01:17:59.621 --> 01:18:01.534
But I just put them in the Van.

01:18:04.967 --> 01:18:08.046
I'm really sorry to
inconvenience you, bro.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:11.112
But get the girl! Now!

01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:13.323
Yes, Jefe.

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.275
Come.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.410
Get the hell away from her.

01:18:25.415 --> 01:18:27.932
I have had it with you, lady.

01:18:34.385 --> 01:18:36.362
Go!

01:18:54.237 --> 01:18:55.380
It's empty.

01:18:55.385 --> 01:18:57.075
Oh, my God.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.321
He doesn't know that.

01:18:58.326 --> 01:19:00.226
What?

01:19:01.697 --> 01:19:03.381
I want you to keep running.

01:19:03.386 --> 01:19:06.498
- What are... what are you gonna do?
- Trust me. Go.

01:19:06.503 --> 01:19:09.458
Go! Go!

01:19:15.298 --> 01:19:17.466
Here. Take it.

01:19:19.283 --> 01:19:20.960
Take it!

01:19:22.472 --> 01:19:25.694
Just take it. I can't
do this anymore.

01:19:28.445 --> 01:19:30.413
You're giving me a gun?

01:19:41.879 --> 01:19:43.986
Go over there.

01:19:46.039 --> 01:19:47.651
Now!

01:20:00.343 --> 01:20:02.441
Don't move!

01:20:02.446 --> 01:20:03.788
Walk towards me!

01:20:03.793 --> 01:20:06.212
No, no, no, turn around,
go up to the boat!

01:20:06.217 --> 01:20:08.214
- What?
- Listen to me.

01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:10.729
- Go to the boat!
- No, you listen to me!

01:20:10.734 --> 01:20:12.418
I'm the one with the gun.

01:20:12.423 --> 01:20:13.798
The gun is empty.

01:20:13.803 --> 01:20:15.300
What?

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:19.695
Run! Go!

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.960
Hey!

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:16.177
I love you. I love you.

01:21:16.619 --> 01:21:18.920
It's over. It's over.

01:21:25.728 --> 01:21:28.068
It's over.

01:21:28.136 --> 01:21:29.902
It's over.

01:22:22.252 --> 01:22:24.383
Muerte Roja,
and Sector A has been

01:22:24.388 --> 01:22:26.942
an ongoing problem
for our district.

01:22:26.947 --> 01:22:30.725
Sergeant Diaz was brought in this
month to Punta Dia to clean it up

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:33.937
after the Police Commissioner
was tipped off

01:22:33.942 --> 01:22:36.340
that the previous Sergeant
and all the officers

01:22:36.345 --> 01:22:39.265
were being paid off
by the local cartel.

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:42.192
They had a deal with
the Guatemalan Border Patrol,

01:22:42.197 --> 01:22:47.496
who were releasing papers on request saying
that the victims had already left Belize.

01:22:47.501 --> 01:22:49.508
Led the families
on a false trail.

01:22:49.513 --> 01:22:52.878
And the local police kept the
victim's passports hidden on site.

01:22:52.883 --> 01:22:56.965
That is correct. We're in a process
of finding the victim's families now.

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.617
Eventually, we'll return them.

01:22:58.622 --> 01:23:01.264
Sergeant Diaz,
he briefed me on the case.

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:06.387
The Tree Hut has been a consistent hub
of criminal activity for sector A.

01:23:06.392 --> 01:23:09.957
Azeem Jones, the proprietor,
he was under extreme duress

01:23:09.962 --> 01:23:14.366
to facilitate in the kidnapping of
tourists for Organ Trafficking.

01:23:14.371 --> 01:23:17.709
They said that they would kill
his family if he didn't comply.

01:23:18.374 --> 01:23:20.773
Rafael was the head runner
of the group.

01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:24.152
With him gone,
we have a good chance

01:23:24.157 --> 01:23:26.279
of taking down the entire cartel.

01:23:27.009 --> 01:23:28.442
Who is Dr. Anschel?

01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:31.910
He's a corrupt surgeon the United
States has been wanting to prosecute

01:23:31.915 --> 01:23:33.942
for years for malpractice.

01:23:33.947 --> 01:23:38.443
He came here years ago for the
non-extradition laws in Belize...

01:23:38.462 --> 01:23:42.389
And then he started a lucrative
underground Trafficking Clinic.

01:23:43.868 --> 01:23:48.285
Something very similar happened
to my nephew Jose many years ago.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:52.037
That's why I became so personally
involved in your case.

01:24:06.723 --> 01:24:09.788
It feels good.
Satisfying.

01:24:09.793 --> 01:24:11.038
I bet.

01:24:11.043 --> 01:24:13.976
If anyone deserves a promotion,
Kate, it's you. Congratulations.

01:24:13.981 --> 01:24:15.070
Thank you.

01:24:15.075 --> 01:24:17.899
Why don't you come for
a real vacation next time, huh?

01:24:17.968 --> 01:24:20.774
All right.
I... I'll think about that.

01:24:21.324 --> 01:24:23.061
Look, I, uh, I gotta go.

01:24:23.066 --> 01:24:25.500
- Okay. Enjoy.
- Bye.

01:24:26.509 --> 01:24:28.420
Who were you talking to?

01:24:28.425 --> 01:24:29.492
No one.

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:32.774
Okay. You guys are video chatting.
Now that's a big step.

01:24:33.776 --> 01:24:35.774
Just have your fruit.

01:24:38.688 --> 01:24:42.164
So I got a phone call
today from June.

01:24:42.183 --> 01:24:43.816
And?

01:24:44.097 --> 01:24:47.126
And she's looking forward
to having us there next summer.

01:24:47.131 --> 01:24:48.852
Me, too.

01:24:49.932 --> 01:24:52.200
Here's to making a difference.

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:54.403
Cheers.

01:25:14.672 --> 01:25:16.270
I love you, mom.

01:25:17.994 --> 01:25:19.903
I love you, too.
