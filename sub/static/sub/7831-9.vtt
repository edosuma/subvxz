- It is?
- We have to make the most of the time we have.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.850
- We do?
- Otherwise, we could wake up one day...

when you bought that hat.

- Okay. Bye. Love ya.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.873
You know, if you lived here,
you'd be home by now.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.207
Mr. Hutz, I didn't know
you sold real estate.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.475
You didn't? We should talk
more often, Marge.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.710
<i>You see, the law business</i>
<i>is a little slow...</i>

04:12.819 --> 04:15.185

wind up losing their houses...

04:15.288 --> 04:17.255
this was a natural move for me.

04:17.357 --> 04:21.793

That must be really rewarding.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.794
Yes, the money is good.

04:23.896 --> 04:27.730
But the beauty is you get to
stay in the house until it's sold.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.769
- Come on, guys. Let's go for a swim.
- [Dogs Barking]

- Nothir but.

- [Groans]
- Oh, boy.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.234

- Superman.
- Oh!

05:22.221 --> 05:24.883
Don't listen to my husband.
He's just an idiot.

05:24.991 --> 05:29.155
I'm a veterinarian, and I need to keep
lots of sick animals in my house.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.628
- Is that permitted?
- Not in my damn house.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.529
Well, this neighborhood
is zoned R-3...

05:34.634 --> 05:38.365

phone-answering monkeys...

05:38.471 --> 05:41.736

05:41.841 --> 05:45.106

all this.

- That's enough, Gill.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.557
Don't drag her down

07:11.030 --> 07:14.693
That's Cookie Kwan.
She's number one on the west side.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.669
Hi, Marge!
Stay off the west side.

07:18.771 --> 07:23.265

07:28.648 --> 07:32.414
- Guess who sold the Whitman place?
- Good for you. Way to go.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.851
I had been working on the Whitman place
for 21 years.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.719
And now, Marge, I'd like
to welcome you to the family...

07:38.825 --> 07:41.658

red blazer.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.991

07:45.932 --> 07:48.560
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Congratulations.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.098
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.

07:56.209 --> 08:00.009
I'm going to do my darnedest
to uphold the principles...

08:00.112 --> 08:03.240
and ideals
this jacket represents.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.448
- I give her a week.
- Are you guys talking about the west side?

08:08.554 --> 08:11.489
No, Cookie. I swear it.
I'm scared of you.

08:13.192 --> 08:17.288
- [Tires Screeching]
- Whoa, Dad, doesn't this car have seat belts?

08:17.396 --> 08:20.923
Seat belts. [Scoffs]
They kill more people than they save.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.797
That's not true.
You're thinking of air bags.

08:25.071 --> 08:29.235
- There it is!
- [Both] Wow!

08:45.725 --> 08:47.955
Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.960
Have you ever considered
selling your home?

08:50.062 --> 08:52.724
What? No. Why? What? Why?
What have you heard?

08:52.832 --> 08:55.426
Are you implying I'm in
some sort of financial trouble?

08:55.535 --> 08:59.938
- No.
- Well, I am. Let me have that card.

09:02.341 --> 09:05.310
And here we have a lovely
gourmet kitchen-

09:05.411 --> 09:07.777
"with gas range,
central can opener...

09:07.880 --> 09:10.906
and foam under flooring
for enanced standability."

09:11.017 --> 09:15.886
Why, isn't this kitchen horribly cramped?
[Laughing]

09:15.988 --> 09:19.856
- Why, yes, it is.
- Well, I suppose we could get used to it.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.689
Yeah, but you shouldn't
have to settle.

09:22.795 --> 09:26.060
You know, I've always loved
the house you're in now.

09:26.165 --> 09:30.693
Really? Well, maybe
we should stay put.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.601
- Thanks for your honesty, Marge.
- My pleasure.

09:33.706 --> 09:37.164

[Clicks Tongue, Laughing]

09:44.584 --> 09:47.280
Good shot, Barbara.
I can't believe it.

09:47.386 --> 09:50.822
- A house with a bowling alley.
- Do you bowl often?

09:50.923 --> 09:53.153
Actually,
this is our first time.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.159
And I didn't really
care for it.

09:55.261 --> 10:00.358
Oh, well, then you have to ask yourself,
is this the right house for you?

10:00.466 --> 10:05.768
I suppose not. I guess we were just
captivated by this delightful plaque.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.635
[Laughing]

10:08.741 --> 10:11.437
[Tires Screech,

Hey, Skinner,

10:14.513 --> 10:17.949
My high school sweetheart
was killed in a drag racing accident.

10:18.050 --> 10:22.146
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- That's what Debbie Sue said.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.559
- Come on, you stupid car.

Premium, dude!

10:59.792 --> 11:02.625
<i>Marge, I had a lot</i>
<i>of calls about you.</i>

11:02.728 --> 11:05.720
Customers love
your no-pressure approach.

11:05.831 --> 11:10.234
Well, like we say,
"The right house for the right person."

11:10.336 --> 11:13.931
Listen, it's time I let you in
on a little secret, Marge.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.838
The right house
is the house that's for sale.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.433
The right person is anyone.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.036
But all I did
was tell the truth.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.982
Of course you did.
But there's the <i>truth...</i>

11:27.186 --> 11:29.882
and the truth!

11:29.989 --> 11:33.550
- Let me show you.
- <i>It's awfully small.</i>

11:33.659 --> 11:36.958
I'd say it's awfully <i>cozy.</i>

11:37.063 --> 11:40.521
- <i>[Marge] That's dilapidated.</i>
- Rustic.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.932
- That house is on fire.
- Motivated seller.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.435
<i>That's a beauty!</i>

11:47.540 --> 11:49.565
Forget about that house.
That's the Murder House.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.870
Ooh, I remember.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.571
Mrs. Astor was very lucky.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.513
Well, no one expects you
to sell that house.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.846
But you'd better
sell something.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.785
Because cubicles
are for closers, Marge.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.948
Anybody who doesn't sell a house
their first week gets fired.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.185
I probably should've
mentioned that earlier.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.456
<i>I thought I'd do anything</i>
<i>to succeed in business.</i>

12:13.566 --> 12:16.364
But bending the truth?
I don't know.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.734
Ah, so you don't have
that killer instinct. Big deal.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.706
Yeah, honey. Even if you
don't succeed in the business world...

12:22.808 --> 12:25.868
you're still the world's
greatest wife and mother.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.811
[Scoffs]
So that's how you see me?

12:28.914 --> 12:32.941
As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife
who can't compete in the real world?

12:33.052 --> 12:34.952
[All]
Mm-hmm.

12:35.054 --> 12:39.423
Well, I can too compete.
And I'm going to sell a house. End of story.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.983
Kids, your mother's under
a lot of pressure.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.189
Why don't we let her
clear the table in peace?

12:47.566 --> 12:49.397
[Groans]

12:51.470 --> 12:54.337
The first house
I have to show you is, um...

12:54.440 --> 12:57.637
a handymars dream.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.301
Mm-hmm.

12:59.411 --> 13:02.141
Because it's so dilapidated.
[Groans]

13:02.248 --> 13:06.344
Well, nothing's perfect. I sure hate to make you
come out here and not buy a house.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.818
Now, slow down, Neddie.
The home buyer's course...

13:08.921 --> 13:11.583
said always look inside the house
before buying.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.657
Well, there it is.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.060
Please don't tell anyone
how I live.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.033
Hmm. It's awfully small.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.695
Some people
would call it cozy.

13:25.805 --> 13:30.037
- I guess it is sorta cute.
- But small. Really, really small.

13:30.142 --> 13:34.545
Hmm. Wh-When you put it that way,
it does seem a bit small.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.171
[Groans]

13:36.282 --> 13:39.718
Well, that about does it
for houses in this area.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.878
Wait.
What about that house?

13:41.987 --> 13:43.955
That has a "for sale" sign.

13:46.425 --> 13:49.622
Ooh, that's a dilly.
How about it, Marge?

13:49.728 --> 13:51.628
Uh-

13:58.370 --> 14:02.204
<i>Oh, my-diddley-eye!</i>
<i>Will you look at this place!</i>

14:02.308 --> 14:05.766
[Gasps] And the price has been
slashed repeatedly.

14:05.878 --> 14:10.008
It's sure built solid. The kids could scream
bloody murder, and no one would hear.

14:10.115 --> 14:13.084
I'm just gonna spill my guts.
I love it to death.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.210
I'm gonna give you a deposit
this minute.

14:17.289 --> 14:20.224
Unless you can give me
a reason not to.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.226
Is there anything else
we should know?

14:22.328 --> 14:27.231
- There's the truth, and the truth!
- No! No!

14:27.333 --> 14:30.996
If you don't sell a house,
you're fired, fired, fired.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.970
[Screaming]

14:34.073 --> 14:36.166
Well, Marge?

14:41.780 --> 14:46.080
No. There is absolutely nothing else
to tell you about this house.

14:46.185 --> 14:50.622
That's good enough for me!
[Screams] Purple drapes!

14:50.723 --> 14:55.057
All my life I've wanted purple drapes!
[Screams]

14:56.762 --> 15:00.425
- [Clanging]
- Attention.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.797
Ding-ding, ding-ding, ding-ding.
Listen up, everybody.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.805
- Marge Simpson sold her first house.
- How about that?

15:07.907 --> 15:12.105
- The Murder House!
- Wow, now, that's something!

15:12.211 --> 15:16.944
Boo-yah! Wow, you must've
told a whopper to unload that death trap.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.540
What'd you use, Marge?
The old buff and bluff?

15:19.652 --> 15:22.416
The Hail Murray?
The Susquehanna Shuffle?

15:22.521 --> 15:25.354
Huh? [Clicks Tongue] Huh? [Clicks Tongue]
Huh? [Laughing]

15:25.457 --> 15:27.357
No. No. No tricks.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.450
It was salesmanship.
That's all.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.121
<i>Sure, Marge.</i>
<i>"Salesmanship."</i>

15:32.231 --> 15:35.928
- But it was.
- Sure, Marge. "Was."

15:36.035 --> 15:39.004
Just because everyone who lived
in that house was hacked to bits...

15:39.104 --> 15:41.231
doesn't mean
the Flanders will be.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.240
- I guess you're right.
- Who cares?

15:43.342 --> 15:45.503
Whatever happens,
as our newest closer...

15:45.611 --> 15:49.604
- you're entitled to wear the coveted closing blazer.
- <i>[Applause]</i>

15:51.150 --> 15:54.210
And you get a third wall
for your cubicle.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.851
- But I earned that wall.
- Don't push your luck, pal.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.858
You're hangir on
by a thread.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.860
Well, I brought this wall
from home.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.930
[Tires Screeching]

16:07.433 --> 16:09.663
[Laughs]
Okay.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.896
Baldy boy hits wire,
head comes off...

16:13.005 --> 16:15.997
L'il Bandit rolls
to a gentle stop.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.975
Everybody wins.

16:20.746 --> 16:24.045
Man, the air feels good
on my neck.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.990
Whoo! Gum ball!

16:34.593 --> 16:37.289
Oh, why do I even bother?

16:37.396 --> 16:39.296
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>

16:39.398 --> 16:44.700
I told that idiot
to slice my sandwich. Ow!

16:44.803 --> 16:48.762
<i>Wow, honey. You sold a house</i>
<i>and got rid of the Flanders.</i>

16:48.874 --> 16:53.834
- What's for dinner?
- Well, neighboreenos, I guess this is good-bye.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.541
Oh, I better make this quick,
or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.117
Yeah, me too.
Let me know if you need any help.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.882
- Now that you mention it, we could use-
- It was just an expression.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.856
[Groans]
Good-bye, Ned.

17:06.959 --> 17:11.259
If the slightest thing goes wrong
with that house, call me right away.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.263
Or you can beep me. In fact,
why don't you just stay here tonight?

17:14.366 --> 17:17.335
- We'll go to a hotel.
- Oh, you're sweet to offer...

17:17.435 --> 17:19.336
but we're all just so tired...

17:19.438 --> 17:22.271
we just wanna get to our new house
and rest in peace.

17:22.374 --> 17:26.276
- <i>So long, Simpsons.</i>
- [All] Bye!

17:27.479 --> 17:29.379
[Shuddering]

17:29.481 --> 17:32.609
That old Flanders place
gives me the creeps.

17:34.586 --> 17:39.546
## [Singing, Screams]

17:39.658 --> 17:42.252
- Give me my car, fatty.
- [Shouts]

17:42.361 --> 17:45.990
This is my car! And I'm not fat!
It's glandular!

17:46.098 --> 17:48.896
- Right.
- [Shouting]

17:49.001 --> 17:51.765
Ohhh!

17:57.576 --> 18:01.535
You've got to tell them
the truth, Marge.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.013
The truth!

18:10.089 --> 18:13.456
Hello? Anyone home?

18:18.130 --> 18:22.533
[Screaming]

18:22.634 --> 18:26.070
Oh, hi, Marge.
I guess we gave you quite a start.

18:26.171 --> 18:29.607
We were painting Todd's room red-
pretty messy work-

18:29.708 --> 18:31.903
and then we came out here
to take a break.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.535
- Must've dozed off.
- Red room.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.376
Red room. Over there.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.384
Well, I'm just glad
you're okay.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.386
[Sighs]

18:42.488 --> 18:44.854
And I have something
to tell you.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.858
[Grunting]

18:47.960 --> 18:51.157
[Tires Screeching]

18:51.263 --> 18:53.254
- Stop it!
- [Grunts]

18:53.365 --> 18:55.993
Come on.
Let's hear that snap.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.695
[Brakes Screeching]

18:58.804 --> 19:00.294
[Grunts]

19:02.441 --> 19:04.773
- [Engine Revving]
- [Shouts]

19:04.877 --> 19:08.005
- [Grunts]
- You-You-

19:08.113 --> 19:09.444
Ow!

19:09.548 --> 19:13.746
- You're... going... down, punk!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:16.855 --> 19:19.983
Whoa, this is so dangerous.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.118
- Yeah, you're right. D'oh!
- [Grunting]

19:23.228 --> 19:27.028
- <i>Why, you-</i>
- Wha-What the-

19:27.132 --> 19:33.071
- This is Wiggum reporting a 318-
waking a police officer.
- [Siren Wailing]

19:33.172 --> 19:36.300
[Gasps]
This is the Murder House?

19:36.408 --> 19:38.876
- Mm-hmm.
- [Gasps]

19:38.977 --> 19:41.844
You mean the infamous
Jealous Jockey Murders?

19:41.947 --> 19:44.745
- Mm-hmm.
- [Gasps]

19:44.850 --> 19:48.217
Of course! This must be
where he dropped the dagger.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.653
And this is the butler's pantry,
where Mrs. Astor concealed herself.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.191
And right here's where
they found the torso heap-

19:54.293 --> 19:56.761
in front of
our very own fireplace!

19:56.862 --> 20:00.389
Oh, just think, Neddie.
We're part of Springfield history.

20:00.499 --> 20:05.095
- Look, Daddy. I'm the jealous jockey.
- I'm a torso.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.765
I'm glad you're not mad.
But I lied to you...

20:08.874 --> 20:11.866
and I won't feel right
until I return your deposit.

20:11.977 --> 20:16.710
We appreciate the offer, Marge,
but I think we're gonna be very happy here.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.409
- [Grunting]
- [All Screaming]

20:19.518 --> 20:21.042
[Both Screaming]

20:22.754 --> 20:25.587
- [Siren Wailing]
- [Screaming]

20:31.263 --> 20:35.791
Uh, Marge- [Chuckles]
you still got that deposit check?

20:39.171 --> 20:42.197
- Oh! Oh, wow.
- [Groaning]

20:42.307 --> 20:45.105
- Lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.
- [Popping]

20:45.210 --> 20:49.442
- Hey, quit hoggir.
- Oh, I'm badly hurt.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.951
A smashed hotrod, a wrecked police cruiser,
a destroyed house!

20:54.052 --> 20:56.247
I've had it with
your renegade ways, Simpson.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.346
- You're a loose cannon.
- But l-

20:58.457 --> 21:01.551
And what really fries me
is you returned his check!

21:01.660 --> 21:05.528
I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz,
but I just can't lie to people.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.531
[Laughing]

21:07.633 --> 21:09.658
You're one of a kind, Marge...

21:09.768 --> 21:12.896
and nobody deserves this
more than you.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.707
[Groans]

21:16.808 --> 21:20.642
Well, I'm proud of you, Mom.
You refused to compromise your integrity.

21:20.746 --> 21:23.681
Yeah. You did the right thing,
eventually.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.548
Still, it would've been nice
to bring home at least one paycheck.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.281
Oh, you will, honey.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.516
You will.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.654
$300 for doing nothing?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.790
I feel like such a crook.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.960
Don't worry.
Gets easier every week.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.402
[Kisses]

22:38.657 --> 22:40.625
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
