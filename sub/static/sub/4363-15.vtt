WEBVTT

00:07.108 --> 00:10.141
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MAN
WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED

00:10.141 --> 00:13.084
TO THE BLACKOUT.
(Janis) HE'S HIGHLY EFFICIENT
IN ADVANCED COMPUTING EQUIPMENT.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.686
HE ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE
A PENCHANT FOR CHESS.

00:15.686 --> 00:19.019
THE MAN YOU CALL D. GIBBONS--
HIS REAL NAME IS DYSON FROST.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.722
HELLO, DEMETRI.
MY NAME IS DYSON FROST.

00:21.722 --> 00:25.556
GOT YOUR ATTENTION, DIDN'T I?
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SAW THIS SYMBOL.

00:25.556 --> 00:28.499
I REMEMBER THE IMAGES, BUT I
JUST CAN'T PUT THEM TOGETHER.

00:28.499 --> 00:32.463
(Nicole) YOUR HAVE
TO FIND HER, BRYCE.
OUR ENTIRE INVESTIGATION HINGES
ON WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

00:32.463 --> 00:36.107
I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
LOSE IT BEFORE APRIL 29th.
WE WENT TO UTAH.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.139
(Demetri) OFFICER DOWN!
D. GIBBONS
KNEW WE WERE COMING.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.540
YOU UNEARTHED
THE SOMALIA PHOTOS.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.212
FIVE MINUTES LATER,
WE'RE GETTING SHOT AT.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.174
WHOEVER WE'RE INVESTIGATING

00:43.174 --> 00:46.177
KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DOING
BEFORE WE DO IT.
WE HAVE 'EM ALL.

00:46.177 --> 00:49.780
YOU'RE FORGETTING THERE'S
ANOTHER PART TO WHAT WE SAW--

00:49.780 --> 00:52.123
THE PART WHERE
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.
HEY, HONEY.

00:52.123 --> 00:54.525
I WANT TO GO AWAY WITH YOU
AND WITH CHARLIE.

00:54.525 --> 00:58.459
I JUST WANT TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS. YES OR NO?

01:02.793 --> 01:04.064
THANKS.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.737
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I WAS IN SURGERY.

01:06.737 --> 01:09.200
OH, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
OH, GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.502
UM, I RAN INTO A BULLET.

01:11.502 --> 01:13.774
BABE, I'M SERIOUS.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.547
6 INCHES THIS WAY,
THIS BULLET'S IN YOUR HEART.

01:16.547 --> 01:18.449
I KNOW.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.751
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN HANDLE THIS ANYMORE.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.083
(sighs)
LIVY, I WAS AN FBI AGENT

01:23.083 --> 01:25.186
WHEN YOU MARRIED ME.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.189
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT NOW.
WE HAVE A DAUGHTER.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.861
I MEAN, IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO YOU, I...

01:30.861 --> 01:32.363
I DON'T WANNA...

01:32.363 --> 01:34.094
(sighs)

01:34.094 --> 01:36.467
LOOK, I GET THAT
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.099
BUT IT--IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.833
I-I MEAN, I'VE GOT TO KNOW
THAT OUR FAMILY COMES FIRST.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.805
SOMETHING'S GOTTA CHANGE.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.508
WEDECK OFFERED ME A POSITION

01:47.508 --> 01:49.840
ON THE DHS
COUNTERTERRORISM TASK FORCE.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.512
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT?

01:51.512 --> 01:55.846
UH... IT'S SURVEILLANCE.

01:55.846 --> 01:58.349
TWO GUYS IN A CAR
EATING BURRITOS,

01:58.349 --> 02:00.191
LISTENING TO PHONE CALLS
IN FARSI.

02:00.191 --> 02:01.892
I'LL BE OUT
OF THE LINE OF FIRE.

02:01.892 --> 02:05.196
MY BIGGEST CONCERNS WILL BE
BOREDOM AND CHOLESTEROL.

02:05.196 --> 02:06.897
YOU'RE GONNA HATE THAT.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.859
MM, BUT I CAN TAKE IT.

02:08.859 --> 02:11.862
WHAT I CAN'T TAKE IS
LOSING YOU AND CHARLIE.

02:11.862 --> 02:15.366
OUR FAMILY WILL ALWAYS
COME FIRST. I PROMISE.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.515
SO, UM, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

02:24.515 --> 02:26.917
I'LL BE STAYING
AT THE WEDECKS'.

02:26.917 --> 02:29.350
(thunder rumbling)

02:29.350 --> 02:32.183
I'M SORRY. I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO DO THIS.

02:32.183 --> 02:35.426
NEITHER DO I.

02:41.632 --> 02:44.395
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE
20 MINUTES.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.871
I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.580
(sighs)

03:03.784 --> 03:06.217
ARE YOU MY NEW PARTNER?

03:06.217 --> 03:09.189
IF YOU ARE, I INSIST
YOU CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
CAN'T CATCH BAD GUYS
IN PAJAMAS.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.963
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:12.963 --> 03:17.268
I'M JUST GOING TO THE WEDECKS'
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

03:17.268 --> 03:19.199
HOW LONG IS A LITTLE WHILE?

03:19.199 --> 03:23.203
WELL, I... HOPE IT'S NOT
VERY LONG AT ALL.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.939
WHAT'S THIS?

03:28.939 --> 03:31.211
YOU LOST YOUR BRACELET.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.913
IT'LL KEEP YOU SAFE
FROM THE BAD GUYS

03:32.913 --> 03:34.915
UNTIL YOU COME BACK HOME.

03:38.389 --> 03:41.852
LET ME PUT IT BACK ON.

03:41.852 --> 03:43.624
(whoosh)

03:46.557 --> 03:48.429
(whispers) COME HERE.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.305
(sniffles) I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
CHARLIE-BEAR.

03:54.305 --> 03:55.566
(kisses)

04:03.744 --> 04:06.917
IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS MESSAGE IN 2010,

04:06.917 --> 04:10.651
THAT MEANS THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT
WAS SUCCESSFUL.

04:10.651 --> 04:15.886
THAT ALSO MEANS WE'VE HAD
A NEAR MISS IN PIGEON, UTAH.

04:17.688 --> 04:19.990
HOW DO I KNOW ALL THIS?

04:19.990 --> 04:24.935
BECAUSE I MYSELF HAVE HAD
HUNDREDS OF FLASH-FORWARDS.

04:26.837 --> 04:30.441
IN NEARLY ALL OF MY FUTURES,

04:30.441 --> 04:34.975
I END UP DYING ON MARCH 15th--

04:34.975 --> 04:37.348
LIKE YOU, DEMETRI.

04:37.348 --> 04:39.980
SO IF YOU MANAGED TO FIND
THIS TAPE IN SOMALIA,

04:39.980 --> 04:44.655
IT WOULD SEEM OUR FATES
ARE ON A COLLISION COURSE,

04:44.655 --> 04:49.890
AND THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF
THE GAME ARE RAPIDLY NARROWING.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.663
AS FOR THE ENDGAME,

04:52.663 --> 04:56.427
THE NEXT MOVE
IS MARK BENFORD'S.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.902
(beep)

05:01.902 --> 05:04.535
THAT'S DYSON FROST?

05:04.535 --> 05:06.076
AND IT'S GENUINE?

05:06.076 --> 05:08.008
YEAH. IT'S LEGIT.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.711
DEGRADATION RATE
IN THE MAGNETIC TAPE

05:10.711 --> 05:13.684
PLUS THE DATE OF PRODUCTION
MAKES IT AUTHENTIC.

05:13.684 --> 05:15.986
THE ONLY EXPLANATION,
HOWEVER IMPLAUSIBLE,

05:15.986 --> 05:20.090
IS THAT FROST FLASHED-FORWARD
FROM 1991 TO OUR PRESENT

05:20.090 --> 05:22.322
AND SAW US IN SOMALIA.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.827
THEN IN 1991, HE MAKES A TAPE
HE KNOWS WE'D FIND.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.700
THAT'S
A 19-YEAR FLASH-FORWARD.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.033
AND MARCH 15th--THE DAY
HE DIES IN HIS FUTURE...

05:33.033 --> 05:37.408
IS THE DATE I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE MURDERED.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.410
MAYBE THAT'S
THE COLLISION COURSE

05:39.410 --> 05:41.612
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

05:41.612 --> 05:43.614
DEM, FROST TALKS ABOUT
NARROWING OUTCOMES--

05:43.614 --> 05:46.417
ANOTHER INDICATION
THAT WHAT PEOPLE SEE

05:46.417 --> 05:48.579
IN THEIR FLASH-FORWARDS...
ARE ONLY POSSIBILITIES.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.981
COULD BE WARNING US.

05:50.981 --> 05:53.954
WARNING US ABOUT WHAT?

05:56.687 --> 05:58.829
THERE'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

05:58.829 --> 05:59.930
WHAT?

05:59.930 --> 06:02.663
HOW? WHEN?

06:02.663 --> 06:05.836
WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT'S
AGENT BENFORD'S NEXT MOVE--

06:05.836 --> 06:08.499
TO FIND OUT AND TO PREVENT IT.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.671
SO LET'S MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.143
FIND DYSON FROST... YESTERDAY.

06:13.143 --> 06:16.146
(Simon)
THIS IS MAGNIFICENT WORK.

06:16.146 --> 06:18.909
MASTER CIRCUITS
BUILT FROM BASIC SKETCHES

06:18.909 --> 06:21.452
I DESIGNED WHEN I WAS 13.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.914
WELL, WHEN YOU FINISH
PATTING YOURSELF ON THE BACK,

06:23.914 --> 06:26.587
CAN WE GET TO WORK?
I HAD TO GO TO A LOT OF TROUBLE
TO GET ALL THIS,

06:26.587 --> 06:28.959
NOT TO MENTION WHAT I HAD TO
GO THROUGH IN THAT BASEMENT.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.592
YES, I KNOW--THE MISSING DIGIT.
A TERRIBLE LOSS.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.895
YOU FIND ANYTHING IN THOSE
DOCUMENTS WE GOT IN SOMALIA?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.598
YEAH, UM, A COUPLE OF THINGS.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.931
THERE WERE SEVERAL REFERENCES
TO TACHYONIC DARK MATTER.

06:40.931 --> 06:43.403
IN '91? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.476
WELL, THE THEORETICAL BASIS
EXISTED.

06:45.476 --> 06:48.138
BUT THE EXPERIMENT FAILED.
BECAUSE THEY NEEDED US.

06:48.138 --> 06:50.941
WELL, CLEARLY, YOU'RE MISSING
THE SILVER LINING.

06:50.941 --> 06:53.644
THE BLACKOUT--
WE'RE OFF THE HOOK.

06:53.644 --> 06:56.647
NOT OUR FAULT.
FROST FLASH-FORWARDED IN '91

06:56.647 --> 06:59.450
USING TECHNOLOGY
THAT WE DID NOT DEVELOP.

06:59.450 --> 07:03.023
SIMON, FLOSSO SAID
OUR N.L.A.P. EXPERIMENTS

07:03.023 --> 07:04.655
AMPLIFIED THE BLACKOUT.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.657
WE CAN'T DODGE THAT.

07:06.657 --> 07:08.859
FIND ANYTHING ELSE
INTERESTING?

07:08.859 --> 07:11.702
I SAW THIS FORMULA
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD...

07:11.702 --> 07:13.433
WRITTEN ON A MIRROR.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.165
(whoosh)

07:15.165 --> 07:17.167
IT'S THE EXACT INVERSE

07:17.167 --> 07:19.810
OF SOME OF OUR EARLY
N.L.A.P. COMPUTATIONS.

07:19.810 --> 07:22.743
I DON'T KNOW--MAYBE A PROCESS
TO REVERSE THE BLACKOUT?

07:22.743 --> 07:25.175
YOU'RE WORKING
ON BLACKOUT PROTECTION

07:25.175 --> 07:28.979
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT WAS
THIS FORMULA, AND THERE WAS...

07:28.979 --> 07:32.022
(whoosh)
THERE WAS MORE OF IT
WRITTEN ON THE MIRROR,

07:32.022 --> 07:33.984
AND THE TWO OF THEM
ARE COMBINED SOMEHOW.

07:33.984 --> 07:36.927
WELL,
WE NEED THE OTHER FORMULA

07:36.927 --> 07:38.989
THAT YOU SAW
ON THE BENFORDS' MIRROR.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.492
GO SEE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

07:41.492 --> 07:44.865
TICKTOCK.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.867
(knocks on door)
NOTHING.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.570
I RAN FACE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
ON EVERY AVAILABLE DATABASE.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.872
SINCE FROST FAKED HIS DEATH
IN 1990,

07:51.872 --> 07:54.905
THERE IS NOT ONE RECORD--NOT ONE
SIGHTING OF THIS GUY. NOTHING.

07:54.905 --> 07:56.877
HE'S A THOROUGH GUY--

07:56.877 --> 07:59.680
LIKES COMPLEX THINGS
LIKE CHESS.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.951
HE'S ALSO GOT
AN ARROGANT STREAK--

08:00.951 --> 08:03.213
LIKES PEOPLE
TO KNOW WHEN HE'S WINNING.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.915
I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH

08:04.915 --> 08:07.217
MEMBERSHIP LISTS
OF CHESS CLUBS PRE-'90.

08:07.217 --> 08:09.990
FROST PLACED THIRD
IN AN AMATEUR LEAGUE IN '87.
(types)

08:09.990 --> 08:13.063
AND THE GUY HE BEAT
LIVES IN SAN FRANCISCO.
(taps key)

08:13.063 --> 08:15.025
HIS NAME IS IAN McKINNON.

08:15.025 --> 08:16.767
McKINNON WAS
THE REIGNING CHAMPION

08:16.767 --> 08:18.969
UNTIL FROST BEAT HIM
IN AN UPSET.

08:18.969 --> 08:22.072
(beeping)
SO I TRACED HIM
AND THEN I GAVE HIM A CALL.

08:22.072 --> 08:26.607
BUT WHEN I MENTIONED FROST,
HE HUNG UP.
WELL, LET'S TRAVEL.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.580
WE NEED TO GET TO SAN FRANCISCO
AND TALK TO HIM, RIGHT?

08:29.580 --> 08:32.112
YEAH. BUT FIRST,
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
(taps key, beep)

08:32.112 --> 08:35.245
THIS IS FROST'S FINAL TOURNAMENT
AGAINST McKINNON.

08:35.245 --> 08:39.149
HE USES A VERY RISKY PLAY
CALLED THE QUEEN SACRIFICE.

08:39.149 --> 08:41.652
LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL HAIL MARY,

08:41.652 --> 08:44.895
BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
EFFECTIVE PLAYS IN THE GAME.
OKAY, SO WHAT?

08:44.895 --> 08:46.897
HE KNEW WE WOULD
SEE THESE GAMES.

08:46.897 --> 08:49.830
IT'S ANOTHER MESSAGE
FROM 1991.
(taps key)

08:49.830 --> 08:51.832
(beeping)
TOURNAMENT GAME SHEETS.

08:51.832 --> 08:55.035
EACH OF HIS MOVES TAKES
EITHER TWO OR FOUR SECONDS--

08:55.035 --> 08:57.968
NEVER MORE, NEVER LESS.
IN THE THREE GAMES,

08:57.968 --> 09:00.010
HE MADE 50 MOVES,
AFTER WHICH HE RESIGNED.

09:00.010 --> 09:04.214
SO THIS IS A CODE
OF SOME KIND. WAIT. IS THIS...

09:04.214 --> 09:06.577
THIS IS MORSE CODE.

09:06.577 --> 09:10.020
2-SECOND MOVES ARE DOTS.
4-SECOND MOVES ARE DASHES.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.583
THERE ARE 50 MOVES,
SO 50 CHARACTERS.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.686
AND THIS IS JUST
JUMBLES OF LETTERS HERE.
NOT LETTERS.

09:15.686 --> 09:18.659
NUMBERS IN MORSE CODE
HAVE FIVE DOTS OR DASHES.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.261
50 DIVIDED BY 5 IS 10--
10 DIGITS.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.193
IS IT A PHONE NUMBER?

09:23.193 --> 09:25.265
(taps key, beep)

09:26.867 --> 09:28.999
(taps key, beeping)

09:28.999 --> 09:31.672
PREPAID CELL.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.874
HE REALLY DID KNOW
THE FUTURE.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.847
(phone rings)

09:36.847 --> 09:39.850
(Frost) Well done.
Leave a message.
(beep)

09:39.850 --> 09:43.113
DYSON FROST?
THIS IS AGENT BENFORD.

09:43.113 --> 09:46.316
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

09:46.316 --> 09:49.860
NOW WE'RE TRAVELING.

09:49.860 --> 09:52.322
(horn honks in distance,
people speaking indistinctly)

09:52.322 --> 09:56.997
(Asian music playing)

09:56.997 --> 09:59.099
(door bells jingle)

10:03.874 --> 10:05.175
(door closes)

10:06.907 --> 10:10.340
(speaks Japanese)

10:10.340 --> 10:12.042
IN ENGLISH, PLEASE.

10:12.042 --> 10:15.686
I KNOW YOU LIKE HALIBUT.
SOME JUST CAME IN THIS MORNING.

10:15.686 --> 10:19.820
NO, THANK YOU.
I ATE... SOME CEREAL.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.693
OH, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU NEED PROTEIN.

10:22.693 --> 10:26.056
YOU ARE KIND, BUT I CAN'T.

10:26.056 --> 10:28.028
IT'S... TOO MUCH MONEY.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.160
(speaking Japanese)

10:35.165 --> 10:38.168
(speaking Japanese)

10:43.243 --> 10:46.076
I WANT A... NEW BEGINNING.

10:46.076 --> 10:48.648
AND NEW LOVE.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.320
(whoosh)

10:50.320 --> 10:52.022
(speaks Japanese)

11:00.090 --> 11:01.962
(whoosh)

11:01.962 --> 11:04.835
SOME MISO SOUP,

11:04.835 --> 11:06.396
A LITTLE RICE?
OKAY.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.039
OKAY.
(door bells jingle)

11:23.053 --> 11:24.715
NOT TODAY.

11:30.921 --> 11:33.093
(sighs)

11:34.965 --> 11:37.397
(Nicole) COME HERE OFTEN?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.930
I'M BEGINNING
TO FEEL LIKE A REGULAR.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.472
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO

11:42.472 --> 11:44.474
THAN HANG AROUND
A CHEMO WARD?

11:44.474 --> 11:46.236
BRYCE, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

11:46.236 --> 11:48.739
YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA LET YOU

11:48.739 --> 11:51.211
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

11:51.211 --> 11:54.084
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

11:54.084 --> 11:56.987
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR PRIDE?
A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

11:56.987 --> 11:58.448
HELLO, IT'S ME.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.952
YOU'VE GLUED PENNIES TO THE WALL
WITH MY LUNATIC MOTHER.

12:01.952 --> 12:04.124
I THINK WE'VE BOTH
SEEN BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.056
BESIDES,

12:06.056 --> 12:09.059
THE CHEMO'S GONNA MAKE YOU
SICK AS A DOG IN 24 HOURS.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.902
SO TONIGHT
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.435
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.407
BUT I'M BUYING DINNER.

12:25.015 --> 12:28.018
(man speaking indistinctly,
seagulls calling)

12:29.349 --> 12:31.982
(Demetri) YOU CALL S.F.P.D.?

12:31.982 --> 12:33.984
(Mark) WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:33.984 --> 12:35.485
(man) RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

12:35.485 --> 12:37.988
(men speaking indistinctly)

12:37.988 --> 12:39.459
HELP YOU GUYS?

12:39.459 --> 12:42.532
SPECIAL AGENT BENFORD.
AGENT NOH.

12:42.532 --> 12:45.035
DETECTIVE JOHN SMITH.
YES, THAT'S MY REAL NAME.

12:45.035 --> 12:47.267
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.369
EH, SOME GUY
FROM THE CHESS CLUB

12:49.369 --> 12:53.543
TOOK TWO IN THE BACK
OF THE HEAD.
DON'T TELL ME--IAN McKINNON?

12:53.543 --> 12:56.146
YEAH, IAN McKINNON.
PERSON OF INTEREST?

13:01.051 --> 13:02.913
NOT ANYMORE.

13:16.126 --> 13:18.098
IAN McKINNON WAS
UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO PLAY

13:18.098 --> 13:20.971
A FEW GAMES OF CHESS
BACK IN THE '80s,

13:20.971 --> 13:23.834
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.
HE WAS OUR BEST LEAD ON FROST,

13:23.834 --> 13:27.037
BUT OUR LEAK TURNED HIM
INTO A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

13:27.037 --> 13:29.179
SAN FRANCISCO BUREAU IS
HANDLING THE FOLLOW-UP,

13:29.179 --> 13:32.182
BUT I'M NOT EXPECTING MUCH.
HOW LONG BETWEEN
WHEN YOU FIRST MADE CONTACT

13:32.182 --> 13:35.015
AND TIME OF DEATH?
EIGHT HOURS TOPS.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.889
THERE'S ONLY ONE CONCLUSION.
THE LEAK WE'VE BEEN TRACKING--
THAT'S COMPROMISED THE SECURITY

13:38.889 --> 13:40.891
OF THE WHOLE
MOSAIC INVESTIGATION--

13:40.891 --> 13:44.054
IS INSIDE THE BUREAU.
NOT JUST THE BUREAU.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.456
NO. INSIDE OUR OFFICE.

13:46.456 --> 13:48.999
(sighs) I'VE BEEN ORDERED
TO GIVE FULL AGENCY SUPPORT,

13:48.999 --> 13:53.003
FRESH PAIR OF EYES,
ALL THE REST OF THAT CRAP.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.106
YOU GOT A PLAY?

13:56.106 --> 13:59.109
MY DAD KNEW A GUY
WHO USED TO GO BLAST FISHING.

13:59.109 --> 14:01.841
HE'D THROW A STICK
OF DYNAMITE IN THE WATER

14:01.841 --> 14:04.044
AND WATCH THE FISH
FLOAT TO THE TOP.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.546
IT WAS UGLY, BUT IT WORKED.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.249
GAME ON.

14:09.249 --> 14:13.123
JUST DON'T FORGET
WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

14:13.123 --> 14:17.387
WHAT'S UNACCEPTABLE IS THAT
ONE OF THEM IS MY ENEMY.

14:34.144 --> 14:36.546
(man) I NEED YOU TO STEP AWAY
FROM YOUR DESK.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

14:36.546 --> 14:39.179
EVERYONE'S REQUIRED TO ASSEMBLE
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, SIR.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.880
ON WHOSE AUTHORIZATION?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.182
SORRY,
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WEDECK.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.413
ORDERS.

14:43.413 --> 14:46.086
WHOSE ORDERS?
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.388
THAT'S NOT PART OF
THE TASK FORCE AGREEMENT.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.360
(clears throat)
UH, NO CALLS,

14:50.360 --> 14:52.993
AND I'LL NEED
YOUR CELL PHONE, PLEASE.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.405
DON'T TOUCH ME, ALL RIGHT?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.277
SIR, YOUR PHONE.

15:11.381 --> 15:15.615
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SOMEONE LOSE THEIR KEYS?

15:15.615 --> 15:18.918
SIMON CAMPOS?
YEAH?

15:18.918 --> 15:22.122
YOU'RE IN THERE ALSO, SIR.
I'M NOT REALLY AN EMPLOYEE.
I'M MORE OF A VISITOR.

15:22.122 --> 15:26.056
WHAT IS THIS? I'VE NOT
EVEN HAD MY COFFEE YET.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.367
(buzzing)

15:37.367 --> 15:40.010
(beeping)

15:47.017 --> 15:49.449
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.452
JUDGING FROM THE WAY OUR OFFICES
ARE BEING TORN APART,

15:52.452 --> 15:55.986
I'D SAY AN INTERAGENCY
TASK FORCE HAS BEEN FORMED

15:55.986 --> 15:57.957
AND IS LOOKING FOR A LEAK.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.430
WE CAN'T JUST LOOK
FOR THE LEAK ON OUR OWN?

16:00.430 --> 16:01.591
(Janis) YEAH.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.195
I THINK THE POINT IS,
ONE OF US IS A MOLE.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.043
AND MARK?

16:13.043 --> 16:15.505
APPARENTLY ALREADY VETTED.

16:17.607 --> 16:21.281
(beeping)

16:21.281 --> 16:24.114
THIS OFFICE HAS BEEN SWEPT.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.186
(beeping continues)

16:26.186 --> 16:31.521
â™ª YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE
OF MY LIFE â™ª

16:31.521 --> 16:34.494
â™ª GIRL â™ª

16:34.494 --> 16:39.299
â™ª FOREVER YOU'LL STAY
IN MY HEART â™ª

16:39.299 --> 16:42.072
â™ª YOU ARE THE APPLE â™ª

16:42.072 --> 16:45.075
(beeping rapidly)

16:47.107 --> 16:48.378
TWEEZERS.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.158
THERE'S YOUR LEAK.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.132
GET OUT.

17:14.264 --> 17:16.506
IT'S VOICE-ACTIVATED.
(door opens)

17:16.506 --> 17:19.069
WHEN YOUR OFFICE IS SWEPT
FOR BUGS AT 4:00 A.M...

17:19.069 --> 17:21.541
(door closes)
THE SWEEPERS DON'T MAKE
ANY SOUND.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.544
NO SOUND, NO TRANSMISSION.
(clatter)

17:24.544 --> 17:27.577
YOU'VE VETTED THE SWEEPERS?

17:27.577 --> 17:31.281
SINCE THE BLACKOUT, ALL TECHS
HAVE BEEN AGENCY-CONTRACTED--

17:31.281 --> 17:33.223
BLIND ASSIGNMENTS.

17:33.223 --> 17:37.087
THAT'S HOW YOU DO SECURITY.

17:37.087 --> 17:41.161
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE SINGING.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.335
SO WHO HAS ACCESS
TO YOUR OFFICE, MARK?

17:47.767 --> 17:51.171
EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM.

17:52.842 --> 17:55.845
TIME TO LIGHT THE FUSE.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.859
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AS YOU MAY HAVE DEDUCED,

18:09.859 --> 18:12.362
WE'RE CLOSING IN
ON A LEAK INSIDE THE FBI

18:12.362 --> 18:15.165
THAT IS HAMPERING
THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION.

18:15.165 --> 18:17.197
NOW ANYONE WANT TO CONFESS?

18:21.671 --> 18:23.473
NO?

18:23.473 --> 18:26.105
THEN IT'S THE HARD ROAD.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.338
YOU'LL BE FIRST, AGENT NOH,

18:28.338 --> 18:32.242
AS YOU WERE PART OF THE FAILED
ATTEMPT TO CONTACT IAN McKINNON.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.884
YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

18:34.884 --> 18:38.348
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

18:44.694 --> 18:47.297
(door closes)
VOGEL, YOU'RE A SON OF A BITCH.
YOU KNOW THAT?

18:47.297 --> 18:50.430
TRUE AS THAT MAY BE, I'M WORKING
WITH AGENT BENFORD TODAY.

18:53.863 --> 18:56.366
I WAS WITH YOU THE WHOLE TIME
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

18:56.366 --> 18:59.339
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THE MOLE.
WHO THEN?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.911
SOMEONE IN THAT ROOM.
IF YOU DON'T THINK
I'M THE MOLE,

19:01.911 --> 19:05.315
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING IN HERE?
I NEED THE MOLE TO THINK
I SUSPECT EVERYONE,

19:05.315 --> 19:07.847
EVEN YOU.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.819
HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA BE
STUCK IN HERE?

19:09.819 --> 19:13.383
(man) GOOD QUESTION.
THEY'VE GOT THEIR WHOLE
PROCEDURE TO GO THROUGH--

19:13.383 --> 19:15.885
RE-VET CONTACT HISTORIES,

19:15.885 --> 19:19.259
BUREAU RECORDS, COMPUTERS.
THAT COULD TAKE DAYS.

19:19.259 --> 19:23.363
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO VET
ALL OF OUR PERSONAL FILES.
NOT IF THEY DON'T
HAVE PASSWORDS.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.894
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP
YOUR PASSWORDS?

19:24.894 --> 19:27.166
NOT TO MY PERSONAL FILES,
NO.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.200
SOMETHING ON YOUR COMPUTER
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SEE?

19:30.200 --> 19:33.343
NO, I MEAN, NOTHING
THAT'S... SENSITIVE.

19:33.343 --> 19:34.944
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M CLEAN.

19:34.944 --> 19:36.846
IT'S PORN. AGENT CURDY,

19:36.846 --> 19:38.848
DOWNLOADING NAKED CHEERLEADERS
ON FBI TIME?

19:38.848 --> 19:41.811
IT--IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S, UM...

19:41.811 --> 19:44.814
IT'S JUST... IT'S AN R.P.G.
OH.

19:44.814 --> 19:46.856
WHAT?

19:46.856 --> 19:48.958
IT'S--IT'S AN R.P.G.
IT'S A ROLE-PLAYING GAME.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.960
I PLAY "WARLOCKS OF AVALON"
ONLINE.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.962
(groans)
I'M A SEVENTH LEVEL DRUID.
MY NAME IS "ARGOTHIC."

19:52.962 --> 19:56.526
(laughter)
YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL POWERS?

19:56.526 --> 19:58.828
UM, CAPE OF INVISIBILITY,
LIGHTNING HAMMER,

19:58.828 --> 20:00.830
ELIXIR OF LIFE, HEALING.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.832
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.974
YEAH, IT'S COOL. (chuckles)

20:11.210 --> 20:13.713
YOU'RE NEXT. VREEDE.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.945
CAN I BORROW THAT CAPE?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.693
THERE ANY REASON WE CAN'T
GET BACK TO WORK,

20:23.693 --> 20:26.225
DO SOMETHING USEFUL?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.699
VOGEL FOUND
A MICROTRANSMITTER...

20:29.699 --> 20:30.900
(clatters)

20:30.900 --> 20:33.703
IN THAT KEY.

20:33.703 --> 20:38.438
YOU WANT TO BE USEFUL? TELL ME
WHO PUT THAT IN MY OFFICE.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.910
YOU THINK IT WAS ONE OF US?
THAT'S THE WORKING THEORY.

20:40.910 --> 20:44.614
HMM. "M"... FOR "MARK."

20:44.614 --> 20:45.875
NICE TOUCH.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.748
UNLESS IT WAS YOU, MARCIE.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.781
(Marcie) CAN YOU SHUT UP
FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES?

20:51.781 --> 20:54.884
WANT SOME SUGAR?
I DON'T USE SUGAR.

20:54.884 --> 20:56.986
MARK? WE'RE WITH YOU.

20:56.986 --> 20:58.257
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.960
THANKS. BUT WE'RE CLOSE.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.464
WE'LL GET HIM.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.966
GOOD THING THE FATE
OF THE PLANET DOESN'T RELY

21:06.966 --> 21:10.570
ON MARK BENFORD
FINDING THE MOLE.

21:10.570 --> 21:15.044
(Spanish hip-hop music playing)

21:15.044 --> 21:18.047
(men speaking indistinctly)

21:22.612 --> 21:25.615
â™ªâ™ª

21:42.332 --> 21:44.904
(drill whirring)

21:44.904 --> 21:47.407
SON OF A BITCH!

21:47.407 --> 21:49.679
EXCUSE ME!

21:49.679 --> 21:52.682
KOREATOWN'S FURTHER WEST.

21:52.682 --> 21:56.015
NO. I'M NOT KOREAN.
I'M JAPANESE.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.848
EITHER WAY,
YOU GOTTA GET ON THE BUS.

22:01.891 --> 22:04.924
(indistinct shouting)

22:06.526 --> 22:10.029
YOU WANT THIS CAR TO DO THAT?
THAT'S THE IDEA.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.061
I LOOK?

22:12.061 --> 22:14.904
YOU LOOK?

22:14.904 --> 22:17.407
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE,

22:17.407 --> 22:19.439
AND YOU DEFINITELY
DON'T BELONG UNDER THE CAR.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.971
HYDRAULICS
OR NITROGEN AIR BAGS?

22:25.014 --> 22:27.016
HYDRAULICS.

22:27.016 --> 22:29.719
COULD BE FRACTURE
IN CYLINDER.

22:29.719 --> 22:31.781
I CAN HELP.

22:31.781 --> 22:35.124
MAYBE I SURPRISE YOU, YES?

22:35.124 --> 22:38.027
OKAY, NINJA GIRL.

22:38.027 --> 22:41.030
BUT IF YOU BREAK MY AXLE,
I'M COMING AFTER YOU.

22:41.030 --> 22:42.732
MM-HMM.

22:42.732 --> 22:45.765
â™ªâ™ª

22:48.137 --> 22:49.939
THANK YOU.

22:53.042 --> 22:54.674
(drill whirs)

22:54.674 --> 22:58.107
THIS IS REALLY SCREWING WITH
MY TRUST ISSUES. YOU KNOW THAT?

22:58.107 --> 23:00.850
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT, JANIS.

23:00.850 --> 23:03.853
I TOOK A BULLET, MARK.
AND I'M SERIOUSLY A SUSPECT?

23:03.853 --> 23:06.756
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
GETTING SHOT AND LIVING

23:06.756 --> 23:08.858
MAKES FOR A PERFECT COVER.
SCREW YOU, VOGEL.

23:08.858 --> 23:12.462
I'M SURE THERE'S
A REASON FOR THIS,

23:12.462 --> 23:15.124
BUT YOU GOT A NUMBER
OF UNACCOUNTED PERSONAL BREAKS

23:15.124 --> 23:17.997
IN THE WEEKS SINCE
THE BLACKOUT--13 IN ALL.
SO?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.470
IN THE THREE PREVIOUS YEARS
AT THE BUREAU,

23:20.470 --> 23:23.933
YOU'VE TAKEN PRECISELY... TWO.
MARK, YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

23:23.933 --> 23:26.936
I'VE BEEN GOING
TO A FERTILITY CLINIC.

23:26.936 --> 23:29.909
YEAH. YOU ONLY HAD
EIGHT VISITS. WE CHECKED.
SO WHAT?

23:29.909 --> 23:33.042
SO I WENT OUT
TO... GO BUY SOME SHOES.

23:33.042 --> 23:36.886
COME ON, MARK.
WHERE WERE YOU?

23:36.886 --> 23:38.988
HMM?

23:42.792 --> 23:45.124
WHAT IS IT, JANIS?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.956
EVER SINCE THE SHOOTING,

23:46.956 --> 23:50.129
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY...

23:50.129 --> 23:51.961
SUSPICIOUS.

23:51.961 --> 23:54.103
JUST CHECKING UP.

23:54.103 --> 23:57.837
AND YOU FOUND SOMETHING?
DOES HE HAVE
TO BE HERE FOR THIS?

24:02.672 --> 24:05.875
MARCIE HAS A BROTHER.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.547
WE KNOW ABOUT HIM.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.519
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE...

24:09.519 --> 24:12.882
A HALF BROTHER.
HE'S VERY SICK.

24:12.882 --> 24:15.525
HE'S DYING IN MISSOURI
IN A FULL CARE FACILITY.

24:15.525 --> 24:17.487
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

24:17.487 --> 24:19.989
MARCIE DIDN'T NAME HIM
IN ANY OF HER APPLICATIONS.

24:19.989 --> 24:23.693
THOSE ABSENCES--I WENT OFF-SITE
TO LOOK INTO SOME THINGS.

24:23.693 --> 24:27.036
YOU NEVER
MENTIONED THIS BEFORE.
I WAS WAITING.

24:27.036 --> 24:29.799
FOR WHAT?

24:29.799 --> 24:32.001
I WAS WAITING TO SEE
IF SHE DID SOMETHING.

24:32.001 --> 24:34.143
AND MARCIE'S PAYING
FOR THIS CARE?

24:34.143 --> 24:37.947
THERE WAS A DEPOSIT MADE
TO AN ACCOUNT FOR $50,000

24:37.947 --> 24:40.009
THREE MONTHS AGO--

24:40.009 --> 24:41.781
ANONYMOUS.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.484
OKAY, JANIS. THANKS.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.887
MARK, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING FOR SURE.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.590
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
YOU'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING.

24:50.590 --> 24:54.023
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

24:54.023 --> 24:55.995
YOU TRUST HER?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.997
YOU KNOW WHAT, VOGEL?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.900
BEING AROUND YOU MAKES ME
NOT TRUST ANYONE ANYMORE.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.171
OOH.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.975
(door closes)

25:20.550 --> 25:22.521
(carousel organ playing,
woman screaming)

25:22.521 --> 25:25.054
(Charlie) IT'S GONNA RAIN.
YEP, BUT WE'RE TOGETHER.
WE'RE HAVING A GIRLS' DAY.

25:25.054 --> 25:27.056
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A GIRLS' DAY.

25:27.056 --> 25:29.058
I WANT DADDY TO BE HERE.

25:29.058 --> 25:30.930
DADDY WANTS TO BE HERE, TOO.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.632
THEN WHY ISN'T HE?

25:32.632 --> 25:35.865
HERE'S THE THING, SWEETIE.

25:35.865 --> 25:40.009
DADDY AND I LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.

25:40.009 --> 25:41.841
BUT MOST OF ALL,
WE LOVE YOU.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.843
AND WE'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE A FAMILY.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.845
THAT'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.017
I PROMISE.

25:48.017 --> 25:51.020
COME ON.
LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. YEAH?
OKAY.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.922
LET'S DO IT.
CAN I RIDE THE FERRIS WHEEL?

25:52.922 --> 25:55.554
YOU WANT TO GO
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL?
UH-HUH.

26:13.002 --> 26:14.674
HEY.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.606
SO I WENT THROUGH
MARCIE'S BACKGROUND.

26:16.606 --> 26:19.578
SHE DID DECLARE HER BROTHER
IN HER INITIAL APPLICATION.

26:19.578 --> 26:23.582
BUT JANIS SAID SHE DIDN'T.
THE ORIGINAL VETTING RECORDS
WERE AT A REGIONAL FIELD OFFICE.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.584
WHEN THEY WERE ROUTED
TO D.C.,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.586
AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE FILE
WAS CREATED.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.319
IT WAS EASY TO MISS, MAN.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.693
YOU OKAY?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.825
YEAH.

26:35.825 --> 26:37.066
NO.

26:37.066 --> 26:39.969
NO.

26:39.969 --> 26:42.071
(blinds rattle, door closes)

26:44.033 --> 26:47.677
I MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE.

26:49.679 --> 26:51.080
YEAH.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.013
OLIVIA AND ME--WE'RE...

26:54.013 --> 26:55.845
I DON'T KNOW.
I-I MOVED OUT.

26:55.845 --> 26:57.987
SORRY.

26:57.987 --> 27:00.920
IS THIS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.221
MM-HMM.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.954
PARTLY THAT,
PARTLY WHAT SHE SAW.

27:04.954 --> 27:07.096
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

27:07.096 --> 27:08.928
NO.

27:08.928 --> 27:13.132
BUT MARCIE'S STILL A SUSPECT,
SO KEEP DIGGING.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.204
ALL RIGHT.

27:15.204 --> 27:18.407
(door opens)

27:18.407 --> 27:22.071
(door closes, blinds rattle)

27:27.947 --> 27:31.050
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

27:31.050 --> 27:33.252
â™ªâ™ª

27:33.252 --> 27:35.925
(thunder rumbles)

27:38.057 --> 27:40.760
(automated male voice)
TELL YOUR FUTURE.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.131
(child laughs)

27:42.131 --> 27:45.134
(girl screaming)

27:47.967 --> 27:50.669
STEP UP AND I...

27:58.978 --> 28:01.811
(automated male voice echoing)
...IN YOUR FUTURE...

28:05.684 --> 28:07.887
CAN WE DO THAT AGAIN?

28:07.887 --> 28:11.190
NO, MY LOVE.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.192
OKAY, LET'S GO.
CAN WE GO AGAIN?
CAN WE GO AGAIN?

28:13.192 --> 28:14.724
NO, SWEETIE.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.001
(screaming)

28:25.704 --> 28:28.707
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING US?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.210
BECAUSE IT'S MY JOB.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.043
I'M SPECIAL AGENT
DANFORTH CROWLEY.

28:34.043 --> 28:36.715
YOUR HUSBAND ASSIGNED ME
TO BE YOUR SECURITY DETAIL.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.919
YOUR SAFETY IS
HIS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.423
(siren wailing in distance)

28:44.423 --> 28:46.996
(drill whirring)

28:46.996 --> 28:49.428
(Spanish hip-hop music playing)

28:49.428 --> 28:51.430
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ENGLISH,

28:51.430 --> 28:53.833
SO I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
A WORK VISA.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.835
I CAN TRY TO GET YOU
PAID OFF THE BOOKS.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.837
THAT'S YOUR FIRST JOB.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
CLIENT WANTS MORE HORSEPOWER,

28:59.839 --> 29:01.941
SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REMAP THE E.C.U.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.943
MY GUYS ONLY WORK
ON CARBURETED ENGINES,

29:03.943 --> 29:06.745
SO FOR THEM IT'S LIKE...
JAPANESE.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.118
(chuckles) GERMAN.

29:09.118 --> 29:13.422
YOU SAID YOU WERE SOME
BIG-TIME ENGINEER BACK IN JAPAN.

29:13.422 --> 29:15.424
MAYBE YOU CAN
FIGURE THIS OUT.

29:15.424 --> 29:18.187
YES. IT IS NO PROBLEM.

29:18.187 --> 29:21.230
YO, EMIL. YOU DIDN'T TELL US
YOU WERE HIRING A MASSEUSE.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.933
(laughter)

29:23.933 --> 29:26.265
LISTEN UP.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.068
CUT THE MUSIC.
I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.
(music stops)

29:29.068 --> 29:31.340
THIS IS KEIKO.
(chuckles)

29:31.340 --> 29:33.342
SHE WORKS HERE NOW.

29:35.344 --> 29:37.907
THAT MEANS
SHE'S PART OF THE FAMILY.

29:37.907 --> 29:40.079
TREAT HER WITH RESPECT,

29:40.079 --> 29:42.181
OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A PROBLEM.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.985
EVERYONE GET THAT?

29:50.890 --> 29:52.922
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

29:55.064 --> 29:56.966
(drill whirs)

29:56.966 --> 29:59.098
(music resumes playing)

29:59.098 --> 30:02.872
ALL RIGHT. GET TO WORK.

30:05.234 --> 30:07.576
HEY, IT'S ME.

30:07.576 --> 30:10.409
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THAT SECURITY DETAIL.

30:10.409 --> 30:14.143
IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME,
BUT I GUESS IT HELPS.

30:14.143 --> 30:15.985
CHARLIE MISSES YOU.

30:15.985 --> 30:19.318
UM, ANYWAY, I'M AT THE HOSPITAL,
SO CALL ME IF YOU--

30:19.318 --> 30:22.021
OLIVIA?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.093
WE NEED TO TALK.

30:32.401 --> 30:34.403
I SWEAR I WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU

30:34.403 --> 30:37.466
IF IT WASN'T ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.

30:37.466 --> 30:40.970
WOW, YOU LITERALLY HAVE
THE WORLD'S WORST TIMING.
WELL, YEAH.
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.942
WHAT DO YOU WANT, LLOYD?

30:42.942 --> 30:45.114
OKAY, I NEED TO KNOW

30:45.114 --> 30:46.876
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD.

30:46.876 --> 30:48.948
I WROTE A FORMULA
ON YOUR BEDROOM MIRROR,

30:48.948 --> 30:52.351
AND I THINK IT RELATES SOMEHOW
TO THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT,

30:52.351 --> 30:55.124
BUT WHAT I SAW WAS INCOMPLETE.
DID YOU SEE IT?

30:55.124 --> 30:57.356
YES, I DID... PART OF IT.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.288
(whoosh)

31:00.529 --> 31:03.893
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

31:03.893 --> 31:06.535
AFTER A WHILE,
I GOT UP FROM THE BED.

31:10.099 --> 31:13.903
THEN I NOTICED SOMETHING
WAS WRITTEN ON THE MIRROR.

31:13.903 --> 31:16.605
IT WAS WRITTEN IN LIPSTICK.

31:16.605 --> 31:19.048
MOST OF IT
WAS INDECIPHERABLE,

31:19.048 --> 31:22.111
BUT I DID RECOGNIZE THIS.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.015
HALOTHANE.

31:26.015 --> 31:28.988
IT'S AN ANESTHETIC.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.962
QUANTUM PHYSICS
AND ANESTHETICS...

31:32.962 --> 31:37.096
THAT'S WHAT MARK AND I WERE
WORKING ON IN OUR FLASH-FORWARD.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.468
I THOUGHT Q.E.D.
MEANT QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS.

31:39.468 --> 31:43.002
BUT WE WERE... BUILDING
A QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DEVICE.

31:45.074 --> 31:48.177
GOOD.
WELL, THAT CLEARS THAT UP.

31:48.177 --> 31:51.180
I HAVE TO BE GETTING ON
WITH MY ROUNDS.
UH, YES, RIGHT. OF COURSE.

31:51.180 --> 31:54.043
LISTEN, I-I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I-I'M HARASSING YOU.

31:54.043 --> 31:57.616
NO, I KNOW. YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.088
GOOD-BYE.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.551
(telephone rings in distance)

32:02.551 --> 32:05.424
(Emil) SO YOU COME HERE
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT

32:05.424 --> 32:07.426
JUST IN CASE
THIS GUY SHOWS UP?

32:07.426 --> 32:09.528
AND DURING THE DAYTIME.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.960
(chuckles)

32:10.960 --> 32:13.032
I KNOW.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.403
I KNOW.

32:14.403 --> 32:17.236
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN FIND HIM.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.239
ALL RIGHT. I RESPECT THAT.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.272
YOU SAW YOUR FATE, AND NOW
YOU'RE DOING YOUR THING.

32:23.272 --> 32:26.115
WHEN I SAW MY FUTURE,

32:26.115 --> 32:29.248
IT WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.380
IT WAS THE FIRST DAY

32:31.380 --> 32:35.084
I LET MYSELF WANT
WHAT WAS IN MY HEART.

32:35.084 --> 32:38.687
SO LIKE YOU SAY,
I AM DOING MY THING.

32:38.687 --> 32:40.259
(chuckles)

32:40.259 --> 32:43.262
(chuckles)

32:43.262 --> 32:46.996
CAN I ASK, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

32:46.996 --> 32:49.668
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN YOU.

32:52.241 --> 32:55.004
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.448
(chuckles) YOU ARE KIND
TO GIVE ME A JOB.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.452
(sighs)

33:03.452 --> 33:05.114
(clink)

33:05.114 --> 33:07.486
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.318
THANK YOU, EMIL.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.692
YOU EVER TRIED SEA URCHIN?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.324
NO. IS IT GOOD?

33:15.324 --> 33:18.127
IT'S LIKE EATING
SOMEBODY'S THYROID.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.768
(chuckles)

33:19.768 --> 33:22.171
AH. WELL,
I'M SURE KEIKO LOVES IT.

33:22.171 --> 33:25.174
AND IF SHE'S THE WOMAN YOU WERE
IN LOVE WITH IN YOUR VISION,

33:25.174 --> 33:27.176
YOU HAVE TO EAT IT WITH HER.

33:27.176 --> 33:29.178
WAIT. THIS--
THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM.

33:29.178 --> 33:31.180
WHAT IF SUSHI'S
HER FAVORITE FOOD,

33:31.180 --> 33:33.442
AND THAT'S ALL SHE
EVER WANTS TO EAT?

33:33.442 --> 33:36.415
OKAY. SUDDENLY SHE'S A MOGWAI.
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.786
A-A WHAT?

33:37.786 --> 33:40.519
NEVER MIND.
WAIT. WHAT--WHAT'S A MOGWAI?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.621
I'M NOT EXPLAINING IT
TO YOU.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.524
JUSTIFY YOUR METAPHOR,
YOUNG LADY.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.526
(sighs) GOD. UM, MOGWAI--

33:47.526 --> 33:50.059
YOU KNOW, GIZMO--
THE LITTLE FURRY CREATURES

33:50.059 --> 33:52.301
THAT TURN INTO GREMLINS
IF YOU DON'T FEED 'EM RIGHT.
OH.

33:52.301 --> 33:55.464
THEY HAD DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
IT'S--FORGET IT.
WOW.

33:55.464 --> 33:57.536
I KNOW.
IT'S A VERY NERDY METAPHOR.

33:57.536 --> 34:01.110
JUST SHUT UP AND READ THE MENU.
OKAY.

34:01.110 --> 34:02.811
I DON'T KNOW.

34:02.811 --> 34:06.545
I'M JUST NOT
FEELING SUSHI TONIGHT.
WELL, I AM.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.718
OKAY.
I GUESS I CAN HAVE TERIYAKI.

34:09.718 --> 34:12.081
YOU'RE KIND OF
A SPOILED BRAT.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.484
I NEVER NOTICED THAT
ABOUT YOU BEFORE.
HOW DARE YOU? I HAVE CANCER.

34:15.484 --> 34:18.657
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

34:23.092 --> 34:25.063
BRYCE.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.137
I'M SORRY. UM...

34:28.137 --> 34:30.099
I DON'T KNOW WHY--
WHY I JUST DID THAT.

34:30.099 --> 34:31.800
I-I KNOW WHY I DID THAT,
BUT...

34:31.800 --> 34:34.573
IT'S--YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN.

34:34.573 --> 34:38.307
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T JUST KISS ME...

34:38.307 --> 34:40.779
IN LITTLE TOKYO, NO LESS.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.152
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M, UM, SORRY.

34:43.152 --> 34:46.385
IT'S JUST...

34:46.385 --> 34:47.856
YOU'RE GREAT.

34:47.856 --> 34:50.159
HONEST MISTAKE.

34:50.159 --> 34:53.392
HEY, JUST BUY ME A BURGER,
AND WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.823
DEAL.

34:57.796 --> 35:01.470
(speaking inaudibly)

35:12.110 --> 35:13.442
(Spanish hip-hop music playing)

35:13.442 --> 35:15.614
GOOD MORNING, KEIKO.
MORNING.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.116
TOO MUCH SAKE?

35:18.116 --> 35:21.290
MM.
NEXT TIME WE HAVE TEQUILA.

35:21.290 --> 35:23.522
MM. HOW'S IT GOING?

35:23.522 --> 35:26.795
MM.
THIS CAR WILL GO VERY FAST.

35:26.795 --> 35:29.298
YOU KNOW, WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE HORSEPOWER.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.900
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO LAUNCH IT
INTO SPACE, YOU KNOW?

35:31.900 --> 35:34.503
(man) IMMIGRATION!
(man) I.C.E. NOBODY MOVE!

35:34.503 --> 35:36.605
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEADS!
JUST DO WHAT I DO.

35:36.605 --> 35:39.137
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

35:39.137 --> 35:42.140
(men shouting indistinctly)

35:42.140 --> 35:44.443
(man) MOVE IT!
PUT YOUR HANDS UP NOW!

35:44.443 --> 35:46.845
NOW! DO IT NOW!
DON'T MOVE!

35:46.845 --> 35:50.619
(siren wailing in distance)

35:50.619 --> 35:53.252
YOU EMIL GUTIERREZ?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

35:53.252 --> 35:55.754
FOR EMPLOYMENT
OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.686
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

35:57.686 --> 36:00.158
KEIKO.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.730
DO YOU HAVE AN I-9?

36:01.730 --> 36:03.692
I-9?

36:03.692 --> 36:06.395
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

36:06.395 --> 36:09.598
(man) ALL RIGHT. LOAD 'EM
INTO THE VAN. LET'S GO.

36:28.357 --> 36:31.360
(sirens whooping and wailing)

36:36.194 --> 36:38.397
(beep)
HEY, IT'S ME.

36:38.397 --> 36:42.331
LISTEN, I-I HAD
A-A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT...

36:42.331 --> 36:45.234
UH, AND I'M--I'M SORRY
ABOUT KISSING YOU.

36:45.234 --> 36:48.206
UM...

36:48.206 --> 36:51.910
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'M--I'M... I'M NOT.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.982
I'M GLAD. SO...
(sirens wailing in distance)

36:53.982 --> 36:56.885
OKAY, WELL,

36:56.885 --> 36:58.917
ANYWAY... UH, BYE.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.732
THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE 36 HOURS.
GOT ANYTHING?

37:13.732 --> 37:16.004
ALL OF MARCIE'S BACKGROUND
HAS BEEN GONE THROUGH

37:16.004 --> 37:18.707
BY VOGEL'S PEOPLE ALREADY--
FINANCIALS, PHONE RECORDS,

37:18.707 --> 37:20.939
BACKGROUND CHECKS
UP THE WAZOO.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.812
I'M DOING SURVEILLANCE
TAGGING RIGHT NOW.
(typing)

37:23.812 --> 37:26.315
THIS SURVEILLANCE TECH
IS GOOD.

37:26.315 --> 37:28.917
(typing)

37:31.950 --> 37:35.624
WAIT.
GO BACK. GO BACK THERE.

37:35.624 --> 37:38.787
(beeping)

37:38.787 --> 37:40.959
HOW MANY TIMES
DOES SHE HAVE COFFEE?

37:40.959 --> 37:44.493
SHE HAS COFFEE
MOST OF THE TIME. WHY?

37:44.493 --> 37:46.835
(beeping)

37:49.298 --> 37:51.900
SHE DOESN'T USE SUGAR.

37:55.744 --> 37:57.946
OKAY. GIVE ME TIME STAMPS

37:57.946 --> 38:00.549
FOR EVERY TIME
SHE PUT SUGAR IN HER COFFEE.

38:01.550 --> 38:03.682
(beeps)

38:03.682 --> 38:05.854
EACH OF THESE TIME STAMPS
CORRESPONDS TO A DAY

38:05.854 --> 38:08.857
A KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION
WAS LEAKED.

38:12.721 --> 38:13.722
(beeps)

38:15.023 --> 38:16.865
LOOK AT THAT.

38:18.867 --> 38:21.970
NO ONE KNEW ABOUT
THE PIGEON, UTAH, TRIP...

38:22.931 --> 38:24.333
(whispers) CRAP!

38:27.806 --> 38:29.808
OR THE SOMALI INTEL

38:29.808 --> 38:32.741
THAT TRIGGERED THE ATTACK
IN WASHINGTON.

38:38.587 --> 38:40.849
EVERY TIME SHE PUT SUGAR
IN HER COFFEE,

38:40.849 --> 38:42.951
SHE WAS SIGNALING
HER HANDLERS.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.907
(screaming)

38:58.907 --> 39:01.970
MARCIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(shell clatters)

39:03.041 --> 39:04.913
(man) DOWN! EVERYBODY DOWN!

39:04.913 --> 39:07.015
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN!
GET DOWN!

39:16.455 --> 39:18.587
(man) GO!
CUT HER OFF AT THE STAIRS!

39:18.587 --> 39:19.958
GO, GO, GO!

39:25.133 --> 39:26.495
(shells clatter)

39:26.495 --> 39:29.898
(motorcycle engine revs)

39:31.400 --> 39:33.942
(tires screech)

39:35.404 --> 39:37.075
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN!

39:38.907 --> 39:39.908
DOWN! DOWN!

39:39.908 --> 39:40.979
(gun fires)

39:43.011 --> 39:44.382
(tires screech)

39:50.919 --> 39:53.562
(shells clatter)

40:01.670 --> 40:03.031
AAH!

40:04.773 --> 40:08.006
(both grunting)

40:10.609 --> 40:12.080
AAH!

40:12.080 --> 40:14.082
HOLD FIRE, HOLD FIRE.
(siren wailing in distance)

40:14.082 --> 40:16.885
(Marcie) AAH!
(water splashes)

40:19.948 --> 40:22.551
(grunts)

40:27.055 --> 40:28.697
MARCIE.

40:28.697 --> 40:30.759
(grunts)

40:30.759 --> 40:33.862
(panting)
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

40:33.862 --> 40:36.705
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE RIGHT,
JANIS.

40:36.705 --> 40:39.938
I WISH I WASN'T.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.474
(sirens whooping and wailing)

40:52.020 --> 40:53.682
HUH.

40:53.682 --> 40:55.854
YOU COULD HAVE
LET ME IN ON IT.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.856
I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
ORDERS.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.157
YOU TOLD DEMETRI.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.761
IT WAS DISCRETIONARY.
I NEEDED PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.963
SO I WAS MANIPULATED
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.666
QUEEN SACRIFICE--
FROST'S PLAY.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.698
HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

41:09.698 --> 41:12.871
WE ALL HAVE OUR WAYS, MARK.
(cell phone rings)

41:12.871 --> 41:14.873
(ring)

41:14.873 --> 41:17.506
(beep)
BENFORD.

41:17.506 --> 41:20.709
Agent Benford. Dyson Frost.
Don't speak. Just listen.

41:20.709 --> 41:24.252
I haven't come forward since
all your leads end up dead.

41:24.252 --> 41:26.885
but now that your mole problem
has been fixed,

41:26.885 --> 41:29.888
I look forward to meeting you.
I'll be in touch.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.059
(beep)

41:33.061 --> 41:35.524
(beep)

41:35.524 --> 41:37.566
(door closes)

41:37.566 --> 41:40.669
YOU WERE
QUITE THE HERO TODAY.

41:40.669 --> 41:45.103
I LIKE A WOMAN WHO KNOWS
HOW TO HANDLE A FIREARM.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.937
FANCY A DRINK?

41:48.937 --> 41:50.909
I'M NOT REALLY YOUR TYPE.

41:50.909 --> 41:55.684
I THINK YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO
LEARN EXACTLY WHAT MY TYPE IS.

41:57.686 --> 42:01.219
I REVIEWED YOUR UNCLE TEDDY'S
AUTOPSY X-RAYS.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.753
THE C.P.R. YOU GAVE HIM
WAS QUITE AGGRESSIVE.

42:04.753 --> 42:07.295
COULD HAVE EVEN BEEN
THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH.

42:07.295 --> 42:10.729
YEAH, I, UH,
CAN BE QUITE A TIGER.

42:12.801 --> 42:14.933
YOU MURDERED HIM
TO SEND A MESSAGE.

42:17.305 --> 42:20.809
MESSAGE RECEIVED.

42:20.809 --> 42:25.213
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

42:25.213 --> 42:28.146
A DOUBLE PLANT.

42:28.146 --> 42:32.851
TWO MOLES,
IN CASE ONE IS CAUGHT.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.883
BRILLIANT.

42:34.883 --> 42:39.057
AND NOT ONE PERSON IN THE OFFICE
WOULD SUSPECT IT'S YOU.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.789
NOT ONE.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.333
WELL, THAT WOULD BE THE POINT,
NOW WOULDN'T IT?
