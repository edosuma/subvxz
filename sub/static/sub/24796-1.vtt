39:28.366 --> 39:29.815
- I don't know, Clare,
it's going to take

39:29.850 --> 39:31.230
a little more than
harnessing your chi

39:31.265 --> 39:32.404
to get out of this one.

39:32.439 --> 39:34.613
[gasping]

39:46.660 --> 39:47.661
Look around.

39:48.869 --> 39:50.802
Is there anything we
can use as a weapon?

39:55.738 --> 39:57.740
- [Clare] He has an ax, we
can't even get close enough.

39:57.774 --> 39:59.224
- We gotta try.

39:59.258 --> 40:00.156
- You can get it open.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.123
- I can't.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.680
[intense ambiance]

40:09.199 --> 40:10.684
- It sounds clear.

40:10.718 --> 40:11.616
- No, no, no, we
should wait here.

40:11.650 --> 40:12.375
- [Branson] It's one guy.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.445
- With an ax.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.378
- I'll go check it out.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.517
- No.

40:16.552 --> 40:17.760
- I'll go check it out.
- No, no, no, no.

40:17.794 --> 40:19.244
Don't leave me!
- You'll be safe.

40:19.278 --> 40:20.107
Trust me.

40:20.935 --> 40:23.110
[gasping]

40:30.013 --> 40:32.913
It looks clear.

40:32.947 --> 40:33.741
- No!

40:33.776 --> 40:35.087
Branson, no!

40:35.122 --> 40:37.849
No, no!

40:37.883 --> 40:39.989
[crying]

40:41.335 --> 40:44.338
[Branson screaming]

40:49.792 --> 40:52.139
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:52.173 --> 40:54.244
[crying]

40:55.176 --> 40:58.179
[sinister ambiance]

40:59.457 --> 41:02.494
- Just, it's not gonna help.

41:02.529 --> 41:03.495
[Thomas screaming]

41:03.530 --> 41:04.392
Stop!

41:05.532 --> 41:06.429
Come on.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.292
Come on.

41:09.018 --> 41:10.502
- You can do this.

41:12.539 --> 41:13.850
You can do this.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.828
You can do this.

41:59.378 --> 42:01.311
- [Thomas] It's somebody
playing, let's go.

42:01.346 --> 42:02.416
- I'm trying.

42:04.038 --> 42:05.523
Slow down, Thomas.

42:07.766 --> 42:09.837
I can't...

42:10.873 --> 42:11.770
What is it?

42:13.392 --> 42:14.704
- [Thomas] It's locked.

42:14.739 --> 42:15.843
- Try it again.

42:15.878 --> 42:16.844
Try it again!

42:16.879 --> 42:18.156
- [Thomas] I did.

42:18.190 --> 42:19.675
- [Rachel] I don't
wanna be in here.

42:19.709 --> 42:22.954
I don't wanna be
in here anymore.

42:22.988 --> 42:24.334
- Let's just go.

42:25.612 --> 42:26.716
- [Rachel] Slow down.

42:26.751 --> 42:27.959
- [Thomas] Hurry up!

42:27.993 --> 42:30.858
- [Rachel] I can't
move as fast as you!

42:31.997 --> 42:35.000
[groans in pain]

42:35.035 --> 42:37.969
[intense ambiance]

42:41.835 --> 42:42.767
- What the fuck?

42:42.801 --> 42:43.940
- What is it?

42:43.975 --> 42:44.734
- Oh, my God.
- No, we need to go.

42:44.769 --> 42:45.942
- I don't wanna go up.

42:45.977 --> 42:47.081
I don't wanna go up.

42:47.116 --> 42:48.289
- Rachel!

42:48.324 --> 42:50.947
- I don't wanna go,
we're gonna die, Thomas.

42:50.982 --> 42:53.087
[crying]

43:10.898 --> 43:13.660
[eerie ambiance]

43:24.291 --> 43:26.465
- I've never seen
a dead guy before.

43:28.398 --> 43:29.986
- I haven't either.

43:33.369 --> 43:34.853
- I just want a slice of pizza.

43:37.753 --> 43:40.687
[intense ambiance]

43:43.206 --> 43:46.313
- Do you think anyone
knows we're here?

43:46.347 --> 43:47.590
- I don't know.

43:48.936 --> 43:50.628
- Let's go this way.

43:51.594 --> 43:54.252
[intense music]

44:00.189 --> 44:01.915
What is this?

44:01.949 --> 44:03.192
- It's the ICU.

44:05.159 --> 44:05.988
- A phone.

44:12.719 --> 44:14.203
There's a dial tone.

44:14.237 --> 44:16.792
- Cool, call 9-1-1.

44:16.826 --> 44:19.760
[intense ambiance]

44:37.157 --> 44:38.261
It's ringing.

44:41.126 --> 44:43.750
No, Thomas, no.

44:43.784 --> 44:45.579
No!

44:45.613 --> 44:47.167
No!

44:52.379 --> 44:54.795
[screeching]

44:57.108 --> 44:58.972
- [Operator] 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

44:59.006 --> 45:00.801
9-1-1.

45:00.836 --> 45:02.872
9-1-1 what's your emergency?

45:12.813 --> 45:15.713
[macabre ambiance]

45:48.124 --> 45:50.126
- I think he's after me.

45:53.026 --> 45:54.717
- Wait, wait, listen.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.236
- What are we listening for?

45:56.270 --> 45:58.583
- Making sure nobody follows us.

45:58.617 --> 46:00.723
- He killed Thomas.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.207
He killed Thomas.

46:02.242 --> 46:03.795
He slit his throat.

46:03.830 --> 46:04.934
He killed Thomas.

46:04.969 --> 46:05.797
- I can't.

46:05.832 --> 46:06.833
- Let's go, come on.

46:06.867 --> 46:07.695
Get up.

46:07.730 --> 46:08.524
[screaming]

46:08.558 --> 46:09.767
Getup, come on!

46:10.629 --> 46:12.217
- He killed Thomas.

46:13.494 --> 46:15.255
- Come on, come on.

46:15.289 --> 46:16.774
[screaming]

46:16.808 --> 46:17.878
Come on.

46:17.913 --> 46:19.742
- Just...
[crying]

46:19.777 --> 46:21.226
- Come on.

46:21.261 --> 46:23.297
[crying]

46:31.098 --> 46:34.550
[labored breathing]

46:34.584 --> 46:36.138
- Are we, are we...

46:37.415 --> 46:38.588
We're outside.

46:40.659 --> 46:42.800
- Maybe we can find a
ladder and get to the roof.

46:42.834 --> 46:44.698
- Okay, okay.

46:44.732 --> 46:45.941
[intense ambiance]

46:45.975 --> 46:46.873
- Let's go.

46:46.907 --> 46:49.254
[squealing]

46:50.669 --> 46:51.739
- He's still coming.

46:51.774 --> 46:53.396
- Run, run!

46:53.431 --> 46:54.777
- [Rachel] Help!

46:56.365 --> 46:57.815
- [Clare] Run.

46:57.849 --> 47:00.748
[intense ambiance]

47:04.649 --> 47:06.824
[panting]

47:13.416 --> 47:14.728
- What are you doing?

47:14.762 --> 47:16.247
- I'm ending this.

47:25.566 --> 47:26.395
No!

47:30.295 --> 47:32.573
No, no.

47:32.608 --> 47:34.921
[screaming]

47:36.612 --> 47:37.440
Ah!

47:45.897 --> 47:47.865
- It's Branson.

47:47.899 --> 47:49.038
Branson, no.

47:49.073 --> 47:50.143
It's Branson.

47:51.144 --> 47:53.042
No!

47:53.077 --> 47:56.321
- Why won't you just die?

47:56.356 --> 47:58.116
[crying]

47:58.151 --> 47:59.877
- It's Branson.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.672
[grunts in rage]

48:03.881 --> 48:06.538
- Die, die.

48:06.573 --> 48:08.920
[screaming]

48:08.955 --> 48:10.922
[grunting]

48:10.957 --> 48:11.889
- Die, die.

48:12.855 --> 48:15.064
[grunting]

48:16.445 --> 48:17.515
- Oh, my God.

48:18.516 --> 48:21.864
[spooky ambiance]

48:21.899 --> 48:24.177
[screaming]

48:25.316 --> 48:27.939
[crying]

48:27.974 --> 48:30.977
[labored breathing]

48:35.188 --> 48:36.983
- Branson.

48:37.017 --> 48:39.088
[crying]

48:43.161 --> 48:44.404
He's behind you.

48:44.438 --> 48:46.820
[bones cracking]

48:46.854 --> 48:49.650
[screaming]

48:49.685 --> 48:52.688
[sinister ambiance]

49:03.699 --> 49:05.287
Watching that is
doing you no good.

49:05.321 --> 49:06.357
It's getting in your head.

49:06.391 --> 49:08.324
Those people are crazy.

49:09.498 --> 49:12.259
[eerie ambiance]

49:31.313 --> 49:32.935
- [Branson] Rachel.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.390
I know you're in here.

49:40.667 --> 49:41.495
Rachel!

49:43.152 --> 49:45.154
I'm sorry, baby.

49:45.189 --> 49:47.260
I should have told
you everything.

49:55.026 --> 49:56.855
Remember that rally
in Washington?

49:58.305 --> 49:59.720
1,000 ports of light, babe.

50:00.825 --> 50:03.310
All those community
organizations

50:03.345 --> 50:05.002
spread throughout the nation,

50:05.036 --> 50:06.451
doing good.

50:10.490 --> 50:12.492
Doing good!

50:13.665 --> 50:16.875
You were a brighter
point of light, babe.

50:16.910 --> 50:17.807
You were.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.156
But then...

50:23.434 --> 50:24.780
They killed a little boy.

50:28.232 --> 50:29.233
Ruby Ridge.

50:30.337 --> 50:32.408
[groans]

50:46.250 --> 50:50.288
That girl, she messed
me up real good.

50:53.705 --> 50:55.949
[coughing]

51:01.748 --> 51:05.545
Let's work together,
get outta here.

51:07.340 --> 51:08.168
Rach?

51:11.999 --> 51:12.897
Rach!

51:14.795 --> 51:16.694
[thud]

51:18.420 --> 51:21.595
We have to stop this
new world order.

51:24.495 --> 51:25.772
He showed me...

51:27.256 --> 51:29.465
That we have to
preserve a way of life.

51:31.743 --> 51:32.848
I have purpose now.

51:35.644 --> 51:36.714
All that suffering...

51:40.235 --> 51:41.236
It was worth it.

51:45.136 --> 51:47.656
It makes us who and
what we are, Rachel.

51:49.589 --> 51:50.417
Rachel.

51:53.351 --> 51:55.422
Rachel, Rachel.

52:03.327 --> 52:05.122
I don't even
recognize you anymore.

52:06.571 --> 52:08.021
And you desecrated your body

52:08.055 --> 52:09.436
with all those markings.

52:14.269 --> 52:15.615
I don't even recognize you.

52:20.999 --> 52:23.209
I'm glad you lost the baby.

52:23.243 --> 52:25.245
You would've made
a terrible mother.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.488
- Fuck you!

52:26.522 --> 52:28.800
[grunting]

52:34.151 --> 52:36.394
[groaning]

52:41.503 --> 52:43.781
[coughing]

53:13.224 --> 53:14.708
[screaming]

53:14.743 --> 53:16.227
No, no!

53:16.262 --> 53:17.228
No!

53:17.263 --> 53:18.988
[groaning]

53:19.023 --> 53:20.266
Stop it!

53:21.405 --> 53:22.682
[screaming]

53:22.716 --> 53:24.615
- Don't look at me.

53:24.649 --> 53:26.203
- Branson, Branson!

53:31.760 --> 53:33.244
[thud]

53:33.279 --> 53:35.350
[crunch]

54:10.350 --> 54:12.628
[sniffles]

54:42.555 --> 54:45.247
[phone ringing]

55:35.401 --> 55:38.024
- [Operator] 9-1-1, did
you call for emergency?

55:38.058 --> 55:39.750
- There's no emergency.

55:39.784 --> 55:41.268
- [Operator] This number
is from the old hospital

55:41.303 --> 55:42.546
where we received a call.

55:44.962 --> 55:47.378
- I didn't call.

55:47.413 --> 55:50.001
- [Operator] Ma'am,
ma'am, hello?

55:50.036 --> 55:50.899
Do you need help?

55:52.210 --> 55:53.350
- There's no emergency.

56:42.882 --> 56:45.056
[gagging]

56:47.369 --> 56:48.784
- [George H. W. Bush]
certain that we stand

56:48.819 --> 56:50.268
at a defining hour.

56:51.787 --> 56:54.100
Halfway around the
world, we are engaged in

56:54.134 --> 56:58.000
a great struggle in the
skies and on the seas

56:58.035 --> 56:59.588
and sands.

56:59.623 --> 57:02.039
We know why we're there.

57:02.073 --> 57:07.078
We are Americans, part of
something larger than ourselves.

57:09.046 --> 57:14.051
For two centuries, we've done
the hard work of freedom.

57:14.845 --> 57:18.158
And tonight, we lead
the world in facing down

57:18.193 --> 57:21.334
a threat to decency
and humanity.

57:22.508 --> 57:27.374
What is at stake is more
than one small country.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.861
It is a big idea.

57:30.895 --> 57:35.866
A new world order, where diverse
nations are drawn together

57:35.900 --> 57:40.733
in common cause to achieve
the universal aspirations

57:40.767 --> 57:42.044
of mankind.

57:42.079 --> 57:45.600
Peace and security, freedom,

57:46.635 --> 57:48.499
and the rule of law.

57:48.534 --> 57:52.676
Such is a world
worthy of our struggle

57:52.710 --> 57:55.057
and worthy of our
children's future.

57:56.507 --> 57:59.579
I have spoken of a
Thousand Points of Light,

57:59.614 --> 58:02.962
of all the community
organizations that are spread

58:02.996 --> 58:05.827
like stars throughout
the Nation, doing good.

58:07.207 --> 58:11.798
We will work hand in hand,
encouraging, sometimes leading,

58:12.661 --> 58:15.595
sometimes being led, rewarding.

58:15.630 --> 58:18.943
We will work on this
in the White House,

58:18.978 --> 58:20.220
in the Cabinet agencies.

58:21.636 --> 58:23.603
I will go to the
people and the programs

58:23.638 --> 58:25.191
that are the brighter
points of light

58:25.225 --> 58:27.331
and I'll ask every
member of my government

58:27.365 --> 58:28.919
to become involved.

58:30.127 --> 58:32.336
The old ideas are
new again because

58:32.370 --> 58:34.994
they're not old,
they are timeless.

58:35.028 --> 58:39.930
Duty, sacrifice,
commitment, and a patriotism

58:39.964 --> 58:42.070
that finds its
expressions in taking

58:42.104 --> 58:44.175
part and pitching in.

58:44.210 --> 58:47.731
I want to continue to
build a lasting basis

58:47.765 --> 58:51.493
for U.S. Soviet cooperation
for a more peaceful
