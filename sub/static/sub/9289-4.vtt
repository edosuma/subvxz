00:13.954 --> 00:16.990
- Did you check the passport information?
- I did.

00:17.082 --> 00:20.249
It confirms Reza Naiyeer
has had contact with Syed Ali.

00:20.335 --> 00:23.336
My sister is marrying
someone who works for terrorists

00:23.421 --> 00:25.081
and you expect me to act normal?

00:25.173 --> 00:29.218
You could endanger yourself and your family
if you let on anything is wrong.

00:29.302 --> 00:30.417
I understand.

00:31.346 --> 00:35.391
George, we need you to check out
a warehouse in the valley.

00:39.855 --> 00:42.891
The substance you inhaled is plutonium.

00:42.983 --> 00:47.894
- How much time do I have?
- As much as a week or as little as a day.

00:48.405 --> 00:49.947
What's going on?

00:50.031 --> 00:53.732
Jack Bauer says that Wald's crew
is planning to blow up CTU.

00:53.827 --> 00:57.445
- Have you contacted CTU?
- Bauer hasn't gotten to Wald yet.

00:57.539 --> 01:01.537
If we stop Wald's crew,
they may realise Bauer turned them in.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.666
Contact CTU immediately.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.879
I won't let him hurt you again.

01:05.964 --> 01:08.669
- You're reporting a child abduction?
- My daughter.

01:08.759 --> 01:11.296
- Describe the suspect.
- Her name's Kimberly Bauer.

01:11.386 --> 01:13.924
It's kinda messed up.
I have the police after me.

01:14.014 --> 01:16.968
- Can you get to CTU?
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:17.392 --> 01:20.346
My name's Kimberly Bauer.
Tony Almeida is expecting us.

01:20.437 --> 01:23.224
You think you'll take that building down
with three charges?

01:23.315 --> 01:26.850
- What made you target CTU anyway?
- Why so many questions?

01:33.742 --> 01:39.163
- We did it, Jack.
- Good job, Eddie. Good job.

01:57.891 --> 02:00.596
The walls are coming down.

02:02.979 --> 02:05.980
We have seven DOAs in the alpha zone.
What's your count?

02:06.066 --> 02:08.142
Ten so far.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.401
Fire and rescue teams are en route.

02:40.225 --> 02:42.301
Tony...

02:42.978 --> 02:45.054
Tony?

02:49.151 --> 02:52.733
Can we get some help over here?
A little help.

02:52.821 --> 02:54.149
Tony!

02:55.157 --> 02:56.781
Michelle!

02:58.201 --> 03:01.451
I need you to set up a triage.
Take Luke with you.

03:02.873 --> 03:05.992
Luke, I've got you. It's Michelle.

03:06.084 --> 03:07.247
Let me see that.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.542
Paula? Paula, can you hear me?

03:10.422 --> 03:11.620
What happened?

03:11.715 --> 03:16.128
You don't have to speak.
Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.

03:16.219 --> 03:19.884
We're gonna get you outta there.
Just hang tight. All right?

03:20.932 --> 03:25.475
She's bad, man. We gotta get a crane
or a hydraulic lift in here.

03:25.562 --> 03:29.311
We have to be careful. If we pull out
the wrong piece, it could come down on her.

03:29.399 --> 03:31.937
We have to do this brick by brick.

03:32.027 --> 03:34.981
That could take for ever.

03:35.071 --> 03:37.148
All right, let's do it.

03:40.410 --> 03:46.080
It's OK. We're gonna be all right.
You're being real brave. Real...

03:46.166 --> 03:48.491
- Ssh, ssh, come on.
- I don't feel very well.

03:48.585 --> 03:52.713
We're gonna be OK. We're gonna
be out of here soon, OK? All right?

03:53.548 --> 03:55.624
Megan! Megan!

03:56.718 --> 04:00.052
Somebody help me! Please, I need some help!

04:00.138 --> 04:02.760
- Hold her down.
- What's wrong with her?

04:02.849 --> 04:04.225
What's the matter?

04:04.309 --> 04:06.349
Megan!

04:06.436 --> 04:08.678
- Megan!
- She's seizing.

04:08.772 --> 04:13.564
- We've gotta get her to the ER right away.
- What's wrong with her?

04:14.194 --> 04:18.523
Sir, we did everything we could do.

04:18.615 --> 04:24.451
If only Bauer had called earlier, even a few
minutes, we could've saved those people.

04:24.538 --> 04:29.413
Until we know more, I'd like to go over
my evacuation plan for LA. It's on your desk.

04:29.501 --> 04:33.629
- I'll call you when I'm ready to meet on it.
- Thank you, sir.

04:41.263 --> 04:43.884
Those people are dead because of you.

04:43.974 --> 04:47.010
- I wanted to tell the president.
- But you didn't.

04:47.102 --> 04:51.598
Because of you, Eric.
You made sure I couldn't get through to him.

04:51.690 --> 04:56.103
As far as I know, Bauer never called.
You're the one who spoke to him.

04:56.194 --> 05:00.026
- Are you blackmailing me?
- I'm protecting the president.

05:00.115 --> 05:05.619
Lynne, whatever you know or think you know,
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

05:18.467 --> 05:22.416
Everything in your car, I had it cleared out
and put into the ambulance.

05:22.512 --> 05:25.513
So whenever you're ready
to go to the hospital.

05:25.599 --> 05:28.600
- So how's it gonna happen?
- Excuse me?

05:28.685 --> 05:30.642
You said I might be dead by tomorrow.

05:30.729 --> 05:35.355
I'm curious to know what to expect
for the rest of the day.

05:35.442 --> 05:39.570
Uh... There's a latent period
where you'll be mostly asymptomatic.

05:39.654 --> 05:44.612
Even in the most extreme cases
of radiation poisoning, it can last a while.

05:44.701 --> 05:46.361
What's a while?

05:46.453 --> 05:49.703
Uh... up to 12 hours, maybe longer.

05:49.790 --> 05:52.577
How do you feel now?

05:52.667 --> 05:53.912
I wanna puke.

05:54.002 --> 05:57.086
I can give you something
to control the nausea.

05:57.172 --> 05:58.335
Thanks, yeah.

05:58.423 --> 06:01.709
At least until the symptoms are more acute.

06:01.802 --> 06:03.878
Yeah, like what?

06:05.430 --> 06:08.301
Your hair will start to fall out.

06:08.391 --> 06:10.218
I'm used to that.

06:10.310 --> 06:14.853
You'll start to manifest
gastrointestinal haemorrhaging,

06:14.940 --> 06:18.273
skin lesions,
bleeding from the mouth and the nose.

06:20.070 --> 06:21.268
OK.

06:21.363 --> 06:24.032
So how am I gonna die?

06:24.116 --> 06:25.823
Um...

06:25.909 --> 06:32.327
Your mental functioning will begin to
deteriorate and then you'll lapse into a coma...

06:32.415 --> 06:33.447
Mr. Mason.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.250
- Not now.
- It's Tony Almeida.

06:35.335 --> 06:36.960
- Not now!
- He said it's urgent.

06:37.045 --> 06:38.954
It's OK.

06:39.714 --> 06:44.008
- Tony, what is it?
- They hit us, George. They bombed CTU.

06:44.094 --> 06:45.754
What kind of damage?

06:45.846 --> 06:49.012
Damage reports are still coming in
but so far we got 19 dead,

06:49.099 --> 06:52.183
20 wounded and seven missing.

06:52.269 --> 06:57.180
We're bleeding bad here, George.
All of our intel on the nuke was destroyed.

06:57.274 --> 07:02.897
It's on the NSA server but Paula wrote
the decryption code and she's in bad shape.

07:02.988 --> 07:07.697
- Do whatever you have to to retrieve it.
- That's why I called you.

07:07.784 --> 07:11.533
- Chain of command, remember?
- Call NSA systems people. Get them on it.

07:11.621 --> 07:13.994
- I already did, George.
- Good.

07:14.082 --> 07:16.205
When are you coming back here?

07:16.293 --> 07:18.001
I'm not sure.

07:18.086 --> 07:20.708
Well, the sooner the better.

07:20.797 --> 07:23.917
Look, the truth is I may not be coming back.

07:24.009 --> 07:27.757
- Why not?
- I'm not in a position to help out right now.

07:27.846 --> 07:29.382
What are you talking about?

07:29.582 --> 07:33.053
Look, a nuclear device is set to
go off some time today in LA.

07:33.143 --> 07:38.054
We lost half the people who could've stopped
it, so stop trying to cover your own ass!

07:38.148 --> 07:41.683
Just deal with it, Tony, OK?
Just deal with it, all right?

07:41.777 --> 07:43.899
Yeah, right.

08:03.465 --> 08:05.956
Jack, you come with me.

08:08.929 --> 08:12.345
All right, light her up.
Let's get outta here.

08:17.187 --> 08:19.559
Hey, Joe. It's done.

08:19.648 --> 08:21.687
No. Nothing.

08:22.526 --> 08:25.645
Yeah. Yeah, I can do it.

08:25.737 --> 08:27.813
Give me the address.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.943
Yeah, I know where it is.

08:34.578 --> 08:36.655
All right.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.369
All right. Out.

08:41.711 --> 08:44.712
- Was that Joe?
- Yeah. Let's go.

08:48.969 --> 08:53.097
- Give me the matchbook, Eddie.
- What the hell are you doing, Jack?

08:53.181 --> 08:57.974
I'm a federal officer. You're under arrest.
Now give me the matchbook.

08:59.521 --> 09:02.771
You helped plant those bombs
and cut Goren's head off.

09:02.858 --> 09:07.151
I know what I did, Eddie.
Put your right hand on the steering wheel.

09:11.825 --> 09:15.490
And very slowly,
with your left hand, pass me your gun.

09:18.582 --> 09:23.493
You know, Jack, when Joe finds out
about this, you're a dead man.

09:23.587 --> 09:25.710
Shut up, Eddie. Get out of the car.

09:28.258 --> 09:29.456
That son of a bitch.

10:54.678 --> 10:56.220
Tony Almeida's line.

10:56.304 --> 10:58.630
- Who's this?
- Michelle Dessler.

10:58.723 --> 11:01.475
This is Jack Bauer. What's going on?

11:01.560 --> 11:06.601
There was an explosion 20 minutes ago.
21 casualties, the number's growing.

11:06.690 --> 11:09.893
- Why wasn't CTU evacuated?
- There wasn't any time.

11:09.985 --> 11:13.852
What do you mean there wasn't enough time?
Is Mason all right?

11:13.947 --> 11:15.145
He wasn't here.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.154
- How about Tony Almeida?
- He's helping the rescue workers.

11:19.244 --> 11:22.993
- Fine. Can you handle a situation report?
- Yeah.

11:26.585 --> 11:27.534
OK, go ahead.

11:27.627 --> 11:30.831
I've located Joseph Wald.
I'm on my way there now.

11:30.922 --> 11:33.544
- What about Wald's crew?
- They're all dead.

11:33.633 --> 11:34.463
Dead?

11:34.551 --> 11:37.220
Just let Mason know
I'm on my way to Wald's house.

11:37.304 --> 11:41.764
The address is 221 Canyon View Road
in Simi Valley.

11:41.850 --> 11:43.309
OK, I'll send backup.

11:43.393 --> 11:48.732
OK. Oh, Michelle, let Mason know
I talked to Kim. She is leaving the city.

11:48.815 --> 11:52.979
- She called here too and she spoke to Tony.
- She did? What did she say?

11:53.069 --> 11:57.447
- I'm not sure. But I'll look into it.
- OK, get back to me. Thanks.

12:01.745 --> 12:03.821
Paula! Paula!

12:04.247 --> 12:06.157
Is she OK?

12:06.249 --> 12:08.242
Tony!

12:09.628 --> 12:11.086
What's up?

12:11.171 --> 12:13.923
- Just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
- Where is he?

12:14.007 --> 12:16.463
On his way to see Wald.
He wanted Mason to know.

12:16.551 --> 12:21.178
Well, Mason's checked out.
Just get the information directly to NSA.

12:21.264 --> 12:23.886
And he asked about his daughter, Kim.

12:23.975 --> 12:26.597
- Oh... Oh, no.
- What?

12:26.686 --> 12:28.182
She was on her way here.

12:28.382 --> 12:32.310
Can you check the security logs,
see if she was in the building?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.477
Thanks.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.690
- Is Megan all right?
- She will be.

12:38.782 --> 12:43.693
Her seizure was caused by pressure
on the brain compounded by a skull fracture.

12:43.787 --> 12:46.076
But she wasn't injured in the explosion.

12:46.164 --> 12:52.333
I know. From what I've seen, her head injury
most likely occurred before the blast.

12:53.088 --> 12:58.331
She's had prior injuries - a fractured wrist,
several fingers that were never treated.

12:58.427 --> 12:59.541
What are you saying?

12:59.636 --> 13:04.132
These injuries suggest
a possible pattern of physical abuse.

13:09.146 --> 13:12.728
You don't think I did this?
You don't think I hurt her?

13:13.316 --> 13:16.851
I'm gonna let the police sort that out.

13:19.322 --> 13:23.819
Bill, they're limiting access.
All we know is that a short time ago,

13:23.910 --> 13:28.204
a major explosion ripped through
this government building in Los Angeles.

13:28.290 --> 13:31.540
No statement has been issued
about the cause of the explosion,

13:31.626 --> 13:36.288
although early speculation has included
rumours of terrorist involvement.

13:36.381 --> 13:40.130
As far as I'm concerned,
this tips in favour of evacuation.

13:40.218 --> 13:44.596
I assume you've all read Eric's report
recommending the evacuation of LA.

13:44.681 --> 13:46.804
The CTU bombing is just the beginning.

13:46.892 --> 13:50.308
It's only a matter of time
before the questions become rumours,

13:50.395 --> 13:52.851
and the rumours set off a mass panic.

13:52.939 --> 13:55.644
Wouldn't the evacuation itself cause panic?

13:55.734 --> 13:59.482
We can do this discreetly.
We've prepared cover stories.

13:59.571 --> 14:02.442
That's a tough sell for nine million people.

14:02.532 --> 14:07.194
General Preston assures me that
the military can contain any civilian unrest.

14:07.287 --> 14:11.664
"Contain" sounds like a euphemism.
Not to mention the Constitutional issues.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.917
I don't claim this'll be a cakewalk.

14:15.962 --> 14:19.462
There's also a practical issue
not being addressed here.

14:19.549 --> 14:20.830
What's that, Lynne?

14:20.926 --> 14:25.884
Our intelligence is specific about
this nuclear device being detonated today.

14:25.972 --> 14:29.970
Your report says it would take
at least one week for this evacuation.

14:30.060 --> 14:34.058
It's my job to protect as many
citizens of the United States as I can.

14:34.147 --> 14:38.359
If I get even 20% of the population
outside the blast radius, that's a win.

14:38.443 --> 14:42.061
We don't know where the bomb is.
Where do we begin the evacuation?

14:42.155 --> 14:45.571
My staff has ranked
ten high probability target areas.

14:45.659 --> 14:48.364
That's not good enough.

14:52.207 --> 14:56.418
Look, I realise you've only had
a short time to prepare this,

14:56.503 --> 14:59.623
but I have some real reservations.

14:59.714 --> 15:05.089
Bottom line, Mr. President, it protects you
politically. If the bomb goes off...

15:05.178 --> 15:10.599
If the bomb goes off, we'll have more
important concerns than my re-election.

15:17.107 --> 15:19.812
Do you have anything else to add?

15:20.735 --> 15:21.565
No, sir.

15:21.653 --> 15:26.398
Then we're done. Until we have reliable
intelligence about where the bomb is located,

15:26.491 --> 15:28.567
there will be no evacuation.

15:30.620 --> 15:35.282
Let General Davenlos know I'm ready for him,
and conference in Ted and Elyse.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.834
Yes, sir.

15:46.011 --> 15:49.131
This is Jack Bauer.
I need to speak to the president urgently.

15:49.222 --> 15:52.757
One moment please, Mr. Bauer.

15:52.851 --> 15:56.718
I need you to confirm these reports
and get them on Novick's desk.

15:56.813 --> 15:59.600
- Lynne Kresge.
- I have Jack Bauer on line eight.

15:59.691 --> 16:04.318
- He insists on speaking to the president.
- Put him through, please.

16:05.197 --> 16:08.897
- Mr. Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
- I asked to speak to the president.

16:08.992 --> 16:12.278
I'm sorry, he's unavailable.
Perhaps I can help.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.244
What the hell are you doing?

16:14.331 --> 16:17.700
I gave you a 30-minute warning
before that building was hit.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.999
You had time to evacuate.

16:20.086 --> 16:22.838
There were extenuating circumstances.

16:22.923 --> 16:25.164
I did try to tell the president.

16:25.258 --> 16:28.295
It's more complicated
than I'm able to explain at this time.

16:28.386 --> 16:31.802
- That's not good enough.
- It's all I can offer you.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.048
- Ms Kresge, right?
- Yes.

16:34.142 --> 16:38.306
You're responsible for killing
innocent people. Friends of mine.

16:38.396 --> 16:43.023
Right now you are the best chance we have
of intercepting that nuclear weapon.

16:43.110 --> 16:46.728
- So I suggest you do your job.
- I'll do my job.

16:46.822 --> 16:49.906
You people better start doing yours.

16:59.709 --> 17:01.252
Dad?

17:01.336 --> 17:06.294
- I need to talk to you. It's important.
- Sure. Sure, honey. Just a second.

17:08.343 --> 17:11.095
This wedding's gonna break me.

17:11.179 --> 17:14.595
So, what's the big emergency?

17:15.851 --> 17:21.604
Last month I was going over the P and Ls
and I found some inconsistencies.

17:21.690 --> 17:24.773
If this is business,
we'll deal with this on Monday.

17:24.859 --> 17:28.525
- Dad, it's about Reza.
- What about Reza?

17:30.740 --> 17:34.074
I thought he might have been
responsible for the missing money

17:34.161 --> 17:37.031
so I hired an investigator to do an audit.

17:37.122 --> 17:41.914
- You hired someone to spy on Reza?
- I thought he was stealing from you.

17:42.002 --> 17:44.409
And is he?

17:44.504 --> 17:50.210
No. But something else came up.
Something a lot worse.

17:51.762 --> 17:52.793
Come on.

17:59.352 --> 18:02.223
Reza may be involved with a terrorist.

18:02.314 --> 18:03.559
What?

18:03.648 --> 18:09.153
Apparently he's been in contact with
someone who finances terrorist operations.

18:09.237 --> 18:11.147
A man named Syed Ali.

18:11.239 --> 18:14.359
- What kind of proof does he have?
- I'm not sure.

18:14.451 --> 18:15.731
You're not sure?

18:15.827 --> 18:22.329
He only called me an hour ago. He told me
not to tell anyone, but I had to tell you.

18:22.417 --> 18:26.367
Whatever this investigator found,
there's an explanation for it.

18:26.463 --> 18:29.630
You hire a man to dig up dirt,
he's gonna dig up dirt.

18:29.716 --> 18:32.337
That's how these guys stay in business.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.384
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

18:34.471 --> 18:36.547
How do you know?

18:40.102 --> 18:43.553
Because I had Reza checked out myself.

18:43.647 --> 18:46.813
And a lot more thoroughly
than the guy you hired.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.687
Kate, Reza is not a terrorist.

18:51.863 --> 18:55.695
Look, I am a businessman, Kate.
A damn good one.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.987
My daughters are my most precious assets.

18:59.079 --> 19:04.915
I wouldn't let either one of you get married
without performing a due diligence.

19:05.001 --> 19:10.541
Now, I want you to drop this nonsense and
start treating him like a member of the family.

19:10.632 --> 19:12.921
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

19:14.594 --> 19:18.972
I think my cousin's
got a little crush on you, Kate.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.762
He wouldn't stop talking about you.

19:21.852 --> 19:24.343
- He seems nice.
- Yeah, he is.

19:24.438 --> 19:28.981
Well, I promised Marie I'd pick up lunch.
I'd better get going.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.234
- Let me take you.
- It's OK, I can handle it.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.986
When you see how much she's ordered,
you'll need another pair of hands.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.782
Really, I can do it.

19:38.535 --> 19:39.863
Kate...

19:41.037 --> 19:42.995
Go.

20:14.946 --> 20:18.232
Mobile 3, this is Dispatch.

20:20.202 --> 20:21.744
This is mobile 3.

20:21.828 --> 20:25.114
I have Tony Almeida at CTU
for George Mason.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.865
- Sir...
- Yeah, I heard.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.757
- Tony?
- George.

20:35.842 --> 20:37.799
I told you to handle this yourself.

20:37.886 --> 20:40.377
If I didn't have to talk to you again
I'd be happy.

20:40.472 --> 20:43.888
But IT need to access the data stream
Paula was working on.

20:43.975 --> 20:45.933
It's on your system. We need your password.

20:46.019 --> 20:48.095
- My password?
- Yeah.

20:49.564 --> 20:50.762
Hendrix.

20:50.857 --> 20:54.273
- That's with an "X"?
- How else would you spell it?

20:54.361 --> 20:55.820
Right. Thanks, George.

20:55.904 --> 20:59.487
- Tony?
- What?

21:00.700 --> 21:01.815
How's Paula doing?

21:01.993 --> 21:05.528
Not good. They're trying to dig her out,
but she's unresponsive.

21:05.622 --> 21:07.698
Look, I gotta go.

21:07.791 --> 21:09.036
OK.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.543
Thank you.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.421
Am I contagious?

21:23.098 --> 21:25.174
No.

22:24.284 --> 22:26.775
Joe, it's Jack. Let me in.

22:28.705 --> 22:31.243
- Where's Eddie?
- He's dead.

22:31.333 --> 22:35.995
- What about Chris and Scott?
- They're dead, too. Let me in.

22:39.132 --> 22:43.794
- I talked to Eddie half an hour ago.
- Joe, we gotta do this inside. Let me in.

22:51.186 --> 22:54.851
Eddie said the job went off without a hitch.
What happened between then and now?

22:54.940 --> 22:57.312
I killed them, for resisting arrest.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.350
I'll kill you, too, Joe.
I mean it. Put it down on the table.

23:02.030 --> 23:04.604
Put it down! On the table, now.

23:08.370 --> 23:10.446
Have a seat on the couch.

23:16.086 --> 23:18.244
You killed Goren.

23:18.338 --> 23:20.627
I did what I had to to find you.

23:20.715 --> 23:23.669
Come on, Jack. What do you want?

23:23.760 --> 23:26.845
Who told you to hit CTU today?

23:26.930 --> 23:29.255
What makes you think anyone told me?

23:29.349 --> 23:34.854
Because there's a nuclear device somewhere
in Los Angeles set to go off today.

23:34.938 --> 23:37.180
That's right, Joe.

23:37.274 --> 23:41.900
CTU was a secondary target. A way
of stopping us from getting to the bomb.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.988
Whoever got you to do this job,
they used you, set you up.

23:45.073 --> 23:49.201
- You're lying, Jack.
- No, this time I'm telling you the truth.

23:49.286 --> 23:52.073
How else do you think I got to Goren?

23:52.164 --> 23:55.615
Come on, you're not stupid. Think about it.

23:55.709 --> 24:01.332
Why did you hit CTU today? Of all the days
you could have, why did you hit CTU today?

24:02.883 --> 24:07.877
You weren't just told where to hit,
you were told when. That's the truth, Joe.

24:07.971 --> 24:13.594
So, I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Who told you to hit CTU today?

25:12.577 --> 25:14.653
Open the door, Joe.

25:16.206 --> 25:18.282
Open the door.

25:21.962 --> 25:24.287
Open the door!

25:33.473 --> 25:36.391
There's no other way outta here, Joe.

26:07.841 --> 26:09.632
- Hello?
- Carla.

26:09.718 --> 26:12.173
- Kim, where are you?
- The emergency room.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.213
- Where's Megan?
- She's with the doctors.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.677
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- She collapsed, started shaking.

26:19.770 --> 26:23.898
The doctors said she had a seizure
because of pressure on her brain.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.224
Where are you? What hospital?

26:26.318 --> 26:27.729
First listen to me.

26:27.819 --> 26:31.484
No, you listen. You kidnapped my daughter
and attacked my husband.

26:31.573 --> 26:35.440
You know that's not true.
It's Gary's fault that Megan is here.

26:35.535 --> 26:38.406
The doctor said she had a seizure
because of a head injury.

26:38.497 --> 26:42.790
- Gary threw her down and she hit her head.
- It was an accident, Kim.

26:42.876 --> 26:45.830
Stop making excuses for him,
denying what's happening.

26:45.921 --> 26:48.044
This isn't your problem, Kim.

26:48.131 --> 26:53.967
They found other things on Megan's X-rays.
They think she's been abused. I think so, too.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.674
Carla, are you there?

27:02.187 --> 27:03.350
Yeah, I'm here.

27:03.438 --> 27:09.274
The hospital called the police. They're on their
way. You should be here when they come.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.440
- Where are you?
- St Virgil's Emergency Room.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.608
I'm 20 minutes away.

27:58.776 --> 28:03.983
A tactical team's on its way, Joe.
There's nowhere for you to go.

28:08.619 --> 28:14.243
The people who gave you the information
for CTU, the schematic, all the access codes,

28:15.877 --> 28:18.878
I want you to know what
they're trying to do.

28:18.963 --> 28:22.712
They wanna destroy this entire country,
starting with LA.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.505
Is that really what you want, Joe?

28:30.558 --> 28:33.974
I thought you wanted
to give the power back to the people.

28:34.061 --> 28:40.431
Isn't that what you used to say? Who do
you think's gonna be at ground zero, Joe?

28:40.526 --> 28:46.066
You're not fighting the federal government.
We're talking about innocent people.

28:46.157 --> 28:49.656
How many of them
are gonna have to die for you today?

28:49.744 --> 28:55.331
A hundred thousand?
Two hundred thousand? No, I don't think so.

28:55.416 --> 29:00.541
I think it's gonna be a lot closer to a million,
once you factor in the radiation.

29:00.630 --> 29:04.129
Is that what you want
your legacy to be, Joe?

29:05.051 --> 29:08.301
Come on, Joe. Just open the door.

29:10.890 --> 29:13.215
Son of a bitch!

29:13.309 --> 29:16.512
That's the funny thing
about people like you, Joe.

29:16.604 --> 29:21.065
You wanna blame the rest of the world
for everything wrong with your life.

29:21.150 --> 29:24.400
The government's too big.
They're too powerful.

29:26.197 --> 29:29.696
Well, here's a bit of irony for you.

29:29.784 --> 29:32.904
You got all the power now, Joe.

29:33.913 --> 29:38.409
You got all the power.
Question is, what are you gonna do with it?

29:38.501 --> 29:42.249
You gonna let all those people die, Joe?

29:42.338 --> 29:47.166
Damm it, Joe! You are running out of time.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.964
We are all running out of time.

30:08.865 --> 30:10.407
You, uh...

30:12.410 --> 30:15.115
don't really like me very much, do you?

30:17.540 --> 30:18.999
That's crazy.

30:20.209 --> 30:25.548
I've been working for your father for
three years. I've been dating Marie for two.

30:26.966 --> 30:31.260
But you and I, we never
really got to know each other.

30:33.389 --> 30:35.880
No, no, we haven't.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.759
So, you don't know who I am.

30:43.483 --> 30:46.519
I know my sister loves you.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.687
Yes, she does.

30:59.415 --> 31:02.369
Where are you going?
It's not the way to Brent's.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.666
I want to show you something first.

31:04.754 --> 31:06.793
What?

31:06.881 --> 31:08.957
It'll only take a few minutes.

31:16.891 --> 31:19.049
Where are we going?

31:19.143 --> 31:24.220
I'm gonna let you in on a secret. In the
spirit of getting to know each other better.

31:33.574 --> 31:35.863
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll find out.

31:35.952 --> 31:38.407
- Tell me now or stop the car.
- It's a surprise.

31:38.496 --> 31:40.453
- Stop the car.
- We're almost there.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.616
I said stop the car!

31:46.337 --> 31:47.962
What are you doing?

31:48.047 --> 31:51.048
Why won't you tell me where we're going?

31:53.177 --> 31:55.253
I wanted to show you the house.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.919
- What house?
- The house...

31:58.349 --> 32:01.599
I just bought for Marie
as a wedding present.

32:02.895 --> 32:06.015
I wanted you to be the first one to see it.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.741
Stand back.

32:17.827 --> 32:20.614
All right, step aside.

32:20.705 --> 32:24.121
Let's get ready to get blood pressure.

32:28.754 --> 32:30.664
OK.

32:31.466 --> 32:34.253
BP's 80 over 50.
Get some saline into her stat.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.217
- Is she all right?
- She's haemorrhaging.

32:36.304 --> 32:40.052
The girder staunched the bleeding,
but once we lifted it off, the dam broke.

32:40.141 --> 32:41.220
Can you stop it?

32:41.309 --> 32:45.258
If we don't get her to the ER,
she'll bleed to death.

32:45.354 --> 32:49.269
Easy. Watch her neck there.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.932
Come on, let's go. Let's get her out, guys.

32:52.528 --> 32:54.272
One, two, three.

32:55.323 --> 32:56.651
All right, easy.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.817
All right, set her down.

32:59.994 --> 33:02.070
Let's go, let's go.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.810
Get a structural engineer
and get him over here now.

33:27.897 --> 33:30.566
I have to keep people working.
What's going on?

33:30.650 --> 33:33.223
I thought you weren't coming back here.

33:33.319 --> 33:35.395
- I changed my mind.
- You did? Why?

33:35.488 --> 33:38.240
I don't have to answer to you.
How bad is she?

33:38.324 --> 33:39.984
She's bleeding internally.

33:40.076 --> 33:44.074
- Anything you can do, you can do here?
- No. She needs surgery.

33:44.163 --> 33:46.868
- Are you gonna put her under anaesthesia?
- Yes.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.034
- How long will she be under?
- A few hours.

33:49.127 --> 33:52.792
Then she stays here. Everything we have
on this nuke has been destroyed.

33:52.880 --> 33:57.258
All we have is the database Paula sent
to the NSA and they didn't get the code.

33:57.343 --> 33:59.585
We'll assign other IT people to retrieve it.

33:59.679 --> 34:04.008
- She's the only one who can decrypt the files.
- We'll send a programmer with her.

34:04.100 --> 34:08.050
We don't have time.
I need her here and I need her lucid.

34:08.146 --> 34:11.846
I don't care what you have to do.
Can you get her conscious?

34:11.940 --> 34:14.858
I can maybe get her BP up temporarily.

34:14.944 --> 34:18.942
- You're out of your mind.
- Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.

34:19.031 --> 34:22.197
This girl deserves a chance to live.

34:22.284 --> 34:25.985
Wake her up. Now!

34:44.348 --> 34:46.920
Tell me we're clear.

34:47.016 --> 34:50.351
Good. I'll speak to you soon. Bye-bye.

34:50.437 --> 34:54.565
Sir, this is Jenny's statement
to the press about the CTU bombing.

34:54.650 --> 35:00.356
I took a quick pass but we can go over it
whenever you get a chance, all right?

35:00.447 --> 35:03.152
Were you ever gonna tell me?

35:09.289 --> 35:12.841
About the 30 minutes
after Jack Bauer called,

35:12.941 --> 35:15.659
and the time you finally warned CTU.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.587
Lynne, I am the president
of the United States.

35:25.097 --> 35:28.300
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

35:31.562 --> 35:35.429
What reason could you have had
for keeping this information from me?

35:35.524 --> 35:38.810
- Sir, I tried to tell you.
- Not hard enough.

35:38.902 --> 35:43.695
Sir, when Jack Bauer called, you were with
the press. I tried to get a message to you.

35:43.782 --> 35:49.025
Good. Now, after we found out
that CTU had been hit,

35:49.121 --> 35:53.498
you still kept from me the fact
that you knew 30 minutes earlier.

36:08.182 --> 36:11.432
Sir, you're right. There's no excuse.

36:11.518 --> 36:13.594
None.

36:19.151 --> 36:22.900
After Jack Bauer called,
did you tell anyone else?

36:29.036 --> 36:32.120
You told Rayburn, didn't you?

36:32.206 --> 36:35.824
And he was the one
that wanted you to keep it from me.

36:35.918 --> 36:39.369
That's why you two were arguing earlier.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.453
Sir, I think, under the circumstances,

36:41.753 --> 36:43.840
it would be best if I
tendered my resignation.

36:43.926 --> 36:46.333
I'll decide what's best.

36:46.428 --> 36:49.180
Yes, of course, sir.

36:49.264 --> 36:52.384
As much as I appreciate the gesture,

36:52.476 --> 36:56.688
I don't have time
to appease your guilty conscience.

37:02.319 --> 37:05.653
But I still trust you, Lynne.

37:05.739 --> 37:09.404
And I trust you'll tell me
everything that happened.

37:11.203 --> 37:13.611
What's going on? Why is she here?

37:17.293 --> 37:20.459
- Why is Paula still here?
- It's Mason's call.

37:20.546 --> 37:23.666
She has almost no chance
if we don't get her to a hospital now.

37:23.757 --> 37:25.002
Yeah, I know.

37:25.092 --> 37:28.046
- I thought Mason wasn't even coming back.
- He's back.

37:28.137 --> 37:32.799
He's trying to revive Paula long enough to
access the information she was sending NSA.

37:32.891 --> 37:35.264
So he's just gonna let her die?

37:35.352 --> 37:38.686
I'm not so sure Mason made the wrong call.

37:39.648 --> 37:44.440
I mean, Paula is the only person
that can retrieve that information.

38:02.463 --> 38:04.539
I'm sorry.

38:05.174 --> 38:07.250
I'm sorry, Tony.

38:10.220 --> 38:13.636
It's just, I'm the one that
brought her to CTU.

38:15.142 --> 38:17.218
I hired her.

38:19.313 --> 38:22.100
This job is all she ever wanted to do.

38:25.069 --> 38:28.354
She never even got a chance to do it.

38:28.447 --> 38:30.523
She did.

38:38.082 --> 38:41.166
We'd better get back to work.

38:57.267 --> 38:59.344
Please come with us, sir.

39:00.479 --> 39:04.097
- Come with you where?
- The president wants to see you.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.876
Mr. President.

39:33.137 --> 39:36.091
You're out, Eric. Effective immediately.

39:36.181 --> 39:40.179
- Sir, if this is about...
- You know exactly what this is about.

39:40.269 --> 39:43.472
- You lied to me.
- Is that what Lynne told you?

39:43.564 --> 39:45.640
Lynne didn't have to tell me anything.

39:45.733 --> 39:50.691
You can't dismiss me now, sir. Not in
the middle of a crisis. You need me here.

39:50.779 --> 39:53.449
I need someone I can trust.

39:53.532 --> 39:55.774
I made a decision that you couldn't make.

39:55.868 --> 40:00.245
I'm the only one who could make it.
And now 27 people are dead.

40:00.331 --> 40:08.540
Collateral damage, sir. Regrettable but
necessary, so that Bauer could get to Wald.

40:13.260 --> 40:16.676
Get him out of here.
Mr. Armus is waiting to talk to him.

40:31.236 --> 40:33.312
OK, Joe, this is how it lays out.

40:33.405 --> 40:37.617
Tactical team's gonna be here
in less than two minutes.

40:37.701 --> 40:40.192
This thing's gonna end in one of two ways.

40:40.287 --> 40:45.661
You're gonna either be dead or you're gonna
spend the rest of your life in prison.

40:45.751 --> 40:49.286
I'm giving you one last chance
to do the right thing.

40:49.380 --> 40:52.049
Open the door.

40:52.132 --> 40:55.252
I just need to know
who told you to target CTU.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.006
Joe, I'm out of time!

41:02.518 --> 41:04.594
Joe, open the door!

41:06.772 --> 41:08.848
You're a son of a bitch, Joe.

41:52.526 --> 41:54.602
Drop the weapon, Joe.

41:58.324 --> 42:03.116
The woman who gave me the plans to CTU,
I only met her twice.

42:05.164 --> 42:09.244
The second time Eddie took some pictures
from down the block.

42:09.335 --> 42:12.086
Drop the weapon!

42:12.171 --> 42:14.247
It's over, Jack.

42:15.799 --> 42:18.373
I can't go back to jail.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.545
No!
