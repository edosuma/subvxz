00:01.120 --> 00:03.168
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.240 --> 00:06.050
It's got to be some sort
of activation signal

00:06.120 --> 00:07.724
to HYDRA members within S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.928
Director Fury is dead.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.963
If HYDRA is really about to
seize this plane...

00:14.040 --> 00:15.007
We should wipe the system.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.367
I'm backing it up on this
hard drive to keep our edge.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.521
Take Agent Garrett into custody!

00:18.600 --> 00:20.250
He's the murderer they
call the Clairvoyant.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.049
You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.043
Care to shoot the right one?

01:05.680 --> 01:06.806
Stop right there!

01:15.560 --> 01:16.971
What are you doing here?

01:29.960 --> 01:31.962
A gift from The Clairvoyant.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.211
Today, world
leaders are scrambling for answers

01:52.280 --> 01:55.124
after the world's
most advanced spy agency

01:55.200 --> 01:57.851
was crippled by a series of attacks.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.246
- Sir?
-Find Agent Martin.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.563
We need a back channel to the UN.
Someone we trust.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.688
...the documents released
from S.H.I.E.L.D...

02:06.760 --> 02:09.080
I made a list of S.H.I.E.L.D. bases
we believe are secure.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.049
How many so far? Seven?

02:11.800 --> 02:12.961
Three.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.121
Plus the Hub.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.361
Including the Hub.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.762
It's a preliminary list.
I'm sure more will turn up.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.081
Members of Congress
are calling for an investigative panel.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.726
But it's still unclear
who should be held accountable.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.121
Many of its leaders have vanished...

02:26.200 --> 02:27.281
You were right all along.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.727
Having all this out there
in the world makes it too dangerous

02:31.800 --> 02:35.009
and now there's no one left to protect it.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.843
There's us.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.241
We were lucky enough
to make it through.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.322
The Triskelion, the Hub?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.961
Those battles are just
the beginning of this war.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.849
HYDRA's out there now,

02:48.920 --> 02:51.764
but at least our team's still intact.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.605
We can fight them. And we will.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.321
Mmm.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.209
This is where we're meeting
The Clairvoyant?

03:22.280 --> 03:26.001
There's no need
to call me that anymore.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.842
Name's John. John Garrett.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.806
Guess you were expecting more
the fortune-teller type?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.049
It's an honor to finally meet you.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.401
Please. Pleasure's all mine.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.882
You've done great work for us
on the Centipede Project.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.929
It was your gift that showed me the way.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.571
Sorry, Flowers, I hate to disappoint you.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.529
I never had any gifts.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.046
At least, not the kind you believed in.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.044
Just a very high-level
S.H.I.E.L.D. security clearance

04:05.840 --> 04:08.764
and a persuasive personality.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.331
You're not clairvoyant?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.240
Hardly.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.368
But if it's any consolation,

04:17.440 --> 04:20.649
you weren't alone in believing,
not by a long shot.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.566
So you're a liar? You're a fraud?

04:25.080 --> 04:29.210
An artist. A con artist perhaps,
but an artist all the same.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.282
Had to pull the wool over
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s eyes somehow.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.285
To do what we set out to do.
Remember what that was?

04:37.160 --> 04:38.924
To change the world.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.923
Why don't you take a seat?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.889
Let me show you how we're doing that.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.243
Don't worry. I wouldn't dream
of letting Ernesto cut your hair.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.205
Welcome to HYDRA.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.650
You need to replace
the grounding wires.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.087
There's no time. Ramp needs to be
repaired by the end of the day.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.161
Coulson's orders.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.924
What? Are they even proper orders?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.241
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been destroyed.
Fury's dead.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.924
Aren't they just requests?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.331
Well, either way, I'm in the middle of it.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.482
Well, he's certainly not taking orders
from anyone.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.608
We have no jurisdiction
now that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s

05:30.680 --> 05:32.762
been labeled a terrorist organization.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.010
Powers that be will sort it out.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.606
All we can do is fix one thing at a time.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.569
Starting with this servo drive.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.642
Yeah, you're right.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.528
However you will need to replace
those grounding wires.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.965
It's fine.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.045
Okay, turn it on!

05:49.280 --> 05:50.406
- Whoa, whoa!

05:50.480 --> 05:51.970
Turn it off!

05:53.600 --> 05:55.523
You need to replace
the grounding wires.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.604
You need to shush. Shush, both of you.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.728
Meh. Honestly, ganging up on me?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.689
Think you're so smart, well,
why don't you try and fix it.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.683
Just bring it up to Logistics.
They'll take it.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.847
- Thanks.
-Right away. Excuse me, sir.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.048
Good news.
The Cube has been retaken.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.441
All HYDRA agents have been flushed
out and are on the run.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.681
So that makes four.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.440
See? I told you more would turn up.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.165
The hull's almost completely repaired.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.443
Flight systems are back online.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.601
And the cargo ramp?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.042
Fitz assures me
that it will be operational.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.088
Sir, incoming transmission.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.969
This is Colonel Glenn Talbot,
US Air Force.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.929
I need to speak
with whoever's in charge over there.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.163
Colonel Talbot, I'm Agent Phil Coulson.
I'm happy we could...

06:31.240 --> 06:34.722
Mr. Coulson. It's a real mess
your boys have gotten us into.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.804
- HYDRA caught us by surprise.
-Well, that's an understatement.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.804
It's troubling how deeply embedded
HYDRA was within your ranks.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.888
Especially troubling for us, sir.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.810
But I assure you,
we're going on the offensive.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.929
The Hub is secure. All remaining
agents stand ready to assist you in...

06:49.000 --> 06:50.764
I think we've had about
all the assistance

06:50.840 --> 06:52.683
we can handle from S.H.I.E.L.D.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.331
I'm sending in a peacekeeping force.
They're gonna take control.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.531
Understood. What should I
tell my men to expect?

06:59.840 --> 07:01.763
We just wanna ask a few questions.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.966
Get the lay of the land.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.441
Everything checks out, you and your
boys can be on your merry.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.726
Sounds good.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.571
This doesn't sound good.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.203
He's lying definitely for sure.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.760
If Talbot's leading the op,
there's nothing peacekeeping about it.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.411
Base defenses are operational.
We could hold out.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.086
The last thing S.H.I.E.L.D. needs is to
start a war with the US Government.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.208
What happens when Talbot gets here?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.089
Best-case scenario,
we all get subpoenas,

07:25.160 --> 07:26.730
spend the next six months
tied up in court hearings.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.921
Worst-case scenario?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.606
Is they skip the subpoenas,
move straight to bunker busters.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.131
Bombs. Big bombs.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.806
- All the while HYDRA's still out there.
-Get on the comms.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.370
We're enacting Odyssey Protocol.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.169
Odyssey Protocol?
What does that mean?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.890
It means Fitz needs to finish his repairs.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.566
- We're getting the hell out of here.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.047
A lot of agents
are staying behind to surrender.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.201
Wish they'd reconsider.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.210
We'll need all the help we can get
to fight HYDRA. How's the bus?

07:52.280 --> 07:53.805
Fitz managed to jerry-rig the ramp,

07:53.880 --> 07:56.406
but the Hub's fuel reserves
were tapped out. We're running low.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.164
Talbot's landing in less than an hour.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.403
- Can you get us up in the air or not?
-I'll have us wheels up in 10.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.291
So you guys are all set to go?

08:04.040 --> 08:06.281
- I appreciate your help.
-Enough to give me a bunk?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.169
Seeing as you guys
are down a specialist.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.401
I was hoping I could hitch a ride.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.686
Not gonna happen.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.802
But feel free to commandeer
one of Hand's vehicles.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.771
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

08:15.920 --> 08:18.810
No problem.
Just not letting you on my plane.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.929
Garrett had me fooled
same as everyone else.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.241
Everyone else wasn't at his side
day in, day out.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.005
Friends of mine are dead
because of him. Good friends.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.367
I think he should come with us, sir.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.842
Duly noted, Agent Simmons,
but this isn't a democracy.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.126
Isn't it?

08:34.240 --> 08:37.130
Under the circumstances,
I think we should all have a say in this.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.361
And I witnessed Agent Triplett

08:38.440 --> 08:40.408
willing to die in defense of S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.121
Respectfully, sir,
I think he should come along with us.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.124
Okay. But Agent Triplett
is your responsibility.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.281
We need to disappear.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.011
Well, only S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers
have cloaking technology.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.287
- Then how do we avoid detection?
-We don't.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.931
Best we can do
is stay out of other aircrafts' radar

09:06.000 --> 09:08.571
and remain in-flight
for as long as possible.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.324
The minute we land,
the harder it is to hide.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.961
Great.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.405
How we doing on supplies?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.811
We're well-stocked up on medical,

09:15.880 --> 09:18.724
but I'm afraid our food rations
will only last a couple of days at best.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.881
Perfect.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.124
- Bad news.
-No kidding.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.282
Fuel line's busted. We're leaking.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.840
- Can we fix it?
-Sure, as soon as we touch down.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.041
Awesome.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.686
Skye, please, tell me something good.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.564
We have Internet.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.641
Yay.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.127
And, boy,
have I lowered my expectations.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.249
But all HQ support systems are gone.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.085
Well, then, the Internet it is.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.244
Find everything you can on our team,

09:46.320 --> 09:47.685
all personal records, photos,

09:47.760 --> 09:51.162
anything that proves we exist,
and erase it.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.727
Uh... That's kind of the nuclear option.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.371
It's our only option.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.728
Every government agency
in the world will be on our ass.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.961
We need to vanish.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.801
Okay, but once that's done,
that can't be undone.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.370
We'll be ghosts.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.490
Not Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
just agents of nothing.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.809
What about Ward?
Have you heard from him?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.731
He and Agent Hand should've dropped
Garrett off at the Fridge by now.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.326
Not yet.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.448
Here, give him a call.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.800
Hearing how Garrett settled into

10:25.880 --> 10:28.042
his tiny, windowless, permanent home

10:28.120 --> 10:29.167
might actually cheer me up.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.050
When you're finished,
collect everyone's badges.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.720
It's no longer something
we wanna flash around.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.524
Any sign of Talbot's forces?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.647
Not yet.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.166
But we've only got eight hours
of flight time before we have to land.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.846
No more than four. Fuel line's leaking.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.371
Wanna tell me where we're going?

10:51.560 --> 10:52.721
I don't know.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.291
It's Coulson.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.850
By all means.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.041
Sir, is everything all right?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.770
Hey, it's me.

11:16.840 --> 11:21.084
I just wanted to let you know
that Grant Ward no longer exists.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.929
You wanna explain that, Skye?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.607
Some trigger-happy colonel
threatened to pay the Hub a visit.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.921
Coulson had us evacuate
before he could lock us all up.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.883
Now I'm scrubbing our ID's

11:31.000 --> 11:32.684
while Coulson figures out
our next move.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.321
Makes sense. Agent Hand picked up
some Navy jets in the vicinity.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.210
She has us taking the long route
to the Fridge just to be safe.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.442
Wow. You took that surprisingly well.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.364
Did you hear the part about you
no longer existing?

11:44.440 --> 11:47.205
Oh, it's not the first time
my identity's been compromised.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.282
Any idea where Coulson
has us headed?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.650
No idea. I'll keep you posted.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.521
Good. I'll catch up with you when I can.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.331
And when I see you next,
who are you gonna be?

11:57.400 --> 12:00.051
You got a clean slate.
You can be anyone you want.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.806
I don't know. Maybe Tom Brady.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.530
I always wanted to play quarterback.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.683
And date supermodels.
You are so predictable.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.242
No, I mean the guy seems
to have things pretty worked out.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.321
Be careful.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.321
You, too.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.444
Tom Brady? You hate the Patriots.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.205
The Agent Grant Ward
she knows doesn't.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.965
Yeah, that straight version
of you is something else.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.002
I don't even think Romanoff
could pull that one.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.844
It wasn't without its complications.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.885
Oh, come on.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.928
You're not still upset about that?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.650
Shooting Skye was not part of the plan.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.883
Near-zero contact,
that was the deal going in.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.011
Though your tip about
the cellist came in handy.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.888
If you had a thing for the girl,
you should've contacted me.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.450
I would've asked for your blessing.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.682
Don't play your games with me.
This isn't a joke.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.364
You don't have to tell me.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.283
Your little candy crush
was on Centipede's tail

12:58.360 --> 13:00.408
long before she was recruited
by S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.211
Seemed like a good person
to eliminate. My bad.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.849
Listen, if the job was easy...

13:06.920 --> 13:08.968
Yeah, the job was to blend in,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.566
gather intel on Coulson's revival,
that's it.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.642
You said yourself,
you didn't want any bloodshed.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.963
That was before I found out
Coulson didn't know squat.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.451
You know, you would've had
an easier time

13:18.520 --> 13:20.409
if I gave the kill order week one.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.211
Yeah, but you didn't.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.804
The girl, I get. She's cute.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.686
But don't forget
what the assignment was.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.446
Don't forget who gave it to you.
And don't forget why.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.449
And cheer up. We're close.
Closer than ever.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.405
So the equipment's here.
What do you want with me?

13:47.760 --> 13:51.003
Well, Flowers, I'm putting you back
in charge of the Centipede Project

13:51.080 --> 13:52.491
to finish Phase 3.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.601
It's Raina.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.047
Sorry, force of habit.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.884
I thought Phase 3 ended

13:57.960 --> 14:00.770
when I couldn't get the truth
about T.A.H.I.T.I. from Agent Coulson.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.640
When they locked me up.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.081
On the contrary.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.323
Your little bedside chats pushed him
in the direction we needed.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.209
Don't get me wrong.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.761
We've had more than a few setbacks.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.121
We've been testing these new drugs,
they all have different numbers.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.770
We thought one of them might contain

14:20.880 --> 14:24.441
whatever Jesus juice brought
Coulson back from the dead.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.806
Where'd you find these?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.882
At the facility where
Fury operated on him.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.201
Coulson walked me in, hand-in-hand.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.770
I'd like to see this facility.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.241
Unfortunately, we ran into
a couple of security chuckle-heads

14:34.320 --> 14:36.129
who decided to hit the kill switch.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.046
I loaded my vest with as many
vials as I could find.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.010
But none of them seem to be
working quite right.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.611
There's the look.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.962
I can see your gears turning now.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.450
I don't have any gifts, Raina,
but you do.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.521
I can't succeed without your help.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.086
I'll need money and resources.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.322
Your bank accounts
are already fully funded.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.927
This is a hard drive with
all of Simmons' research.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.163
With Coulson and Skye's blood work,
all the data on the Guest House drug...

15:06.240 --> 15:09.084
If there's a key to how this stuff works,

15:09.160 --> 15:11.003
you'll find it in there.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.963
If you need anything else, just whistle.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.166
Where are you going?

15:16.560 --> 15:19.291
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most secure
facility is vulnerable right now.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.361
The Fridge?

15:20.760 --> 15:25.402
Oh, you've heard of it?
Yeah, well, we're gonna raid it.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.485
This wasn't easy.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.881
Simmons got choked up
when I asked for hers.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.730
This was big for me.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.646
Finally felt like I was part of something,

16:06.920 --> 16:08.729
and now it's worthless.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.248
I'm sorry.
I can't imagine what this is like for you.

16:23.760 --> 16:28.527
You gave your life, literally,
gave your life to S.H.I.E.L.D.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.128
I was younger than you
when Fury recruited me.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.489
Just out of high school.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.211
Some days it feels like only yesterday.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.486
Other days,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.525
a lot longer.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.609
Is that your badge?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.523
They look like coordinates.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.126
Coordinates to where?

17:03.360 --> 17:04.849
I don't know yet.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.611
But there's only one person
who could've sent these.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.367
And this is totally his style.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.400
So, Director Fury's alive?

17:14.480 --> 17:16.209
What did he say?
Does he have a plan?

17:16.520 --> 17:17.851
He only sent coordinates.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.321
The coordinates should put us
somewhere in the Canadian wilderness.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.367
What exactly are we looking for
here, sir?

17:23.440 --> 17:26.250
It's unclear.
Maybe a rally point of some kind.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.084
Sir, have you and Agent Fury

17:28.160 --> 17:29.730
used this form
of communication before?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.564
- Never.
-Then how can you be sure...

17:31.640 --> 17:33.802
- 'Cause this is how he operates.
- Could be a trap.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.008
So far, everything has been a trap.
Am I wrong?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.844
HYDRA could've sent you
those coordinates.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.649
Nick Fury gave me this badge.

17:45.880 --> 17:50.283
When he did, I swore an oath.
We all did.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.522
To serve when everything else fails.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.841
To be humanity's last line of defense.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.649
To be the shield.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.088
These coordinates mean something.
I'm certain of it.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.402
Fury also gave me this plane.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.047
Anyone wants off?
Chutes are in the bay. Help yourself.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.448
We were outnumbered, and
S.H.I.E.L.D. pressed the advantage.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.090
You managed to make it out
with the chopper?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.440
Yes, sir.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.251
No worries, then.
The Cube's small potatoes.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.085
Once we hit the Fridge and grab all
the fun toys tucked away inside,

18:27.160 --> 18:28.969
we'll be able to take any base we want.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.280
Hail HYDRA!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.647
All right, all right,
put your arms down, Kaminsky.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.485
You look like a West Texas cheerleader
at a pep rally.

18:35.560 --> 18:39.007
Let me see that weapon.
Tuck that strap in.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.724
You were disappointed.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.640
That he wasn't a real clairvoyant.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.451
There was a question I would've asked.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.046
You've known him a long time?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.850
Since I was a teenager.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.720
He pulled me out of a hell,
saved me from myself.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.686
So now do you know me?

19:05.760 --> 19:07.250
Know how to work me?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.085
I'm just curious.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.490
If I wanted to work you,

19:11.560 --> 19:13.961
I'd ask you about Coulson and his team,

19:14.040 --> 19:16.486
and how you managed
to gain their trust.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.800
I jumped out of a plane.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.844
Deep cover tactics 101.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.809
Perform selfless acts of bravery
early on.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.329
So, I jumped to save the scientist.
I had a parachute.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.080
They never suspected?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.083
Agent May was the primary threat.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.845
So I let things get intimate.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.445
You don't seem like her type.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.761
I'm everyone's type.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.923
Skye was the unknown variable.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.480
Being her S.O. put me in a position
to be a sounding board.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.005
Get an idea what she was thinking.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.841
And Coulson, he wasn't skeptical
when you pressured him to join?

19:49.200 --> 19:50.201
Hmm.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.521
He pressured me.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.602
You'd be surprised how often
you get invited to the party

19:53.680 --> 19:54.806
when you don't wanna go.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.163
"Sir, I was trained from day one
as a specialist.

19:59.240 --> 20:04.485
"I go in alone, I get it done.
This team thing? Not my speed."

20:07.720 --> 20:10.803
I gave Coulson a person
he thought he could help.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.645
- Plane was full of them.
-it's that simple?

20:13.720 --> 20:16.451
You really felt nothing for them?

20:17.880 --> 20:21.362
I spent time with Coulson,
he's a good man.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.329
Someone who'd lay down
his life for you.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.047
Don't you owe a man
like that something?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.446
Sure.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.490
But I owe Garrett everything.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.167
Yeah, it's gonna be great. All right.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.286
You Okay?

20:43.360 --> 20:44.566
Tell you what.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.849
Let's skip the part where
you act concerned about my well-being.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.360
What is it you want?

20:51.120 --> 20:53.088
I need to confiscate your weapon.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.051
You wanna share the twisted logic

20:55.120 --> 20:57.521
that makes you think
that's a possibility?

20:57.640 --> 20:59.005
Fury's dead.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.924
It's hard to accept, and we haven't
had a chance to grieve...

21:03.000 --> 21:06.004
There's no reason to.
I have faith that he's alive.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.445
That feeling?

21:08.240 --> 21:11.244
This belief that he is reaching
out to you, Phil?

21:11.320 --> 21:15.041
It might not be faith.
It might be something else.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.201
And what's that?

21:16.720 --> 21:17.767
HYDRA.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.886
HYDRA?

21:21.160 --> 21:23.208
Impulses implanted in your brain,

21:23.280 --> 21:26.250
right alongside memories
of a beautiful island.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.802
Really? This is what you wanna
come to me with right now?

21:30.800 --> 21:34.088
That's not possible.
Fury ordered the surgery.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.209
Yes, but he wasn't in charge
of the T.A.H.I.T.I. Project.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.886
And the person that was behind
that operation may be...

21:39.960 --> 21:42.042
Wait, wait, what did you say?

21:43.760 --> 21:46.809
Somebody else was behind it?
Who the hell was that?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.609
- I don't know.
-Who? Tell me!

21:48.680 --> 21:49.920
Phil, I don't know.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.525
You don't know?

21:51.840 --> 21:52.841
Oh.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.090
Let me guess? Only Fury knows?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.601
Yes.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.651
And without him, there's no way
to know who is responsible.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.563
And there is a real danger

22:05.640 --> 22:08.166
that HYDRA's controlling your actions.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.767
That's why Fury put me on this plane.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.171
To watch you.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.001
I'm not gonna hand over my weapon.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.085
You wanna try to take it from me?

22:24.560 --> 22:25.641
Good.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.006
Now get out of my office.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.440
We have to trust that Coulson
knows what he's doing.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.367
- Hey, I respect Coulson...
-Agent Coulson to you.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.646
Agent Coulson.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.722
He saved our asses back at the Hub.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.842
But I'm telling you,
he's chasing the white whale.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.968
Okay, have you even read Moby Dick?

22:48.040 --> 22:49.804
Yeah. Have you?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.370
That's not the point.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.965
Now if you please stop
spouting your nonsense

22:54.040 --> 22:56.520
and let me get back
to checking my inventory.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.530
He may be right, Fitz.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.046
Coulson could be leading us
into a trap and not even know it.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.884
The whole world's coming
apart at the seams.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.850
- Now's not the time to follow blindly.
-No.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.281
It's times like these you stick
with the guy you believe in.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.845
It's 100 floors.
But the only way in is through the roof.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.169
Identify yourself
and state your purpose.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.531
Agent Grant Ward,
you know who this is.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.681
Hand called it in.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.764
We have specific orders
not to let anyone in

23:40.840 --> 23:43.127
without Agent Hand present.
So, where is she?

23:43.200 --> 23:44.281
Where do you think she is?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.761
She's heading to meetings

23:45.840 --> 23:48.081
with every high-ranking
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent still out there.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.040
There's a war going on,
in case you guys missed it.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.244
You really want me to radio her?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.687
Have her turn the plane around,
come all the way back?

23:58.760 --> 24:00.250
That's exactly what you need to do.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.886
All right. I guess you boys have
never seen Hand angry, have you?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.121
Take cover!

24:14.200 --> 24:15.406
HYDRA!

24:27.960 --> 24:30.406
- Open the door!
-it's against protocol.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.323
I don't care about your protocol!
Open the door!

24:32.400 --> 24:34.607
You're gonna get me killed!

24:34.680 --> 24:36.409
Screw it.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.010
Come on, come on!

24:39.120 --> 24:40.281
Come on.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.011
- Took you boys long enough.
-We need to radio security.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.651
How the hell did HYDRA know
that you and Hand were coming?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.250
We told them.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.367
A little warning next time?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.204
I mean, they had automatic weapons.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.602
I couldn't resist. it was too good a line.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.685
Let's go shopping-

25:24.000 --> 25:25.490
Air's clear.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.681
First time I came down here
was to lock up Johnny Horton.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.841
Ever heard of him?

25:29.920 --> 25:32.844
That guy somehow gave himself
these lion's paws for hands.

25:32.920 --> 25:33.967
Can you imagine?

25:34.480 --> 25:36.209
That doesn't seem practical.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.329
Everybody's got their own
weird thing I suppose. Here we go.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.325
You know the Slingshot program?

25:43.400 --> 25:46.961
Yeah, that's how S.H.I.E.L.D. gets rid
of its dangerous technology.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.121
Do they, now?

25:53.040 --> 25:55.122
Welcome to the toy store.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.004
All right, grab all you can, boys.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.368
If it looks dangerous, good.
Alien, even better.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.125
It's all here. The Slingshot's a fake.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.806
They shot a lot of empty rockets
into space.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.771
Maybe every once in a while
they put a monkey in one for kicks.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.850
You really think Fury would
give away all these goodies?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.490
We're talking about the same guy
that messed around

26:15.560 --> 26:19.007
with Tesseract technology
and sparked an alien invasion.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.650
There you are.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.966
Remember this?

26:26.040 --> 26:30.841
Yeah. We found it in Peru.
Some sort of plasma particle beam.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.048
Plasma particle beam, my ass.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.521
I look at it more as a gold card.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.364
Coordinates are about
a seven-mile hike from here.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.681
Terrain's pretty rough,
even if it wasn't covered with snow.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.842
Agent May and I could
lead a scouting party first.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.251
Make sure this isn't a trap.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.606
There's no time.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.529
In less than eight hours,
a NATO satellite

26:59.600 --> 27:01.250
will pass directly over us.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.244
If the bus is still here, they'll know.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.561
I've been doing this long enough
to know that somethings up there.

27:07.640 --> 27:10.883
But this mission has to be your choice.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.367
A lot's changed in the last few days.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.408
I know you all have your doubts

27:18.480 --> 27:21.290
about what we've been doing,
about me.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.681
But I don't.

27:25.120 --> 27:29.170
Which is why I'm going to find
whatever Fury has waiting for us.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.083
With you, or without you.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.729
Well, you heard the man.
We don't have much time.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.884
You're welcome, gentlemen.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.164
Don't forget to follow your dreams.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.769
Ladies.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.682
This ought to keep Coulson busy
a while.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.289
Grant. Come on.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.681
We gotta roll. Chopper's almost full.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.808
- There it is.
-What the hell are you doing?

28:38.880 --> 28:41.565
You mind?
You might wanna take a step back.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.687
I'm not following.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.161
Coulson told me there was a little
something hidden down below.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.847
Hate to tell you but
this is the bottom floor.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.649
I've seen the blueprints
with my own eyes.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.801
Care to make it interesting?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.161
Loser buys dinner.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.485
Perfect. I'm so sick of the crap
we ate on that plane.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.809
Well, hello, gorgeous.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.800
This is not good.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.644
Bears? Did it find bears?

29:50.720 --> 29:52.688
No. It found nothing.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.001
No sign of life, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base,

29:55.080 --> 29:57.003
or anything making it
even remotely worthwhile

29:57.080 --> 29:59.003
freezing our butts off.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.490
Did you mean what you said
earlier about Coulson?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.605
I don't know, Jemma.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.764
I wanna believe Coulson knows
what he's doing, but...

30:11.720 --> 30:14.291
Well, at least we still have each other.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.328
Yeah. Good.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.167
'Cause the last thing I want
is for things to change.

30:20.520 --> 30:24.525
Fitz. It's too late for that.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.685
You think he's okay?

30:39.760 --> 30:41.683
It's been a rough couple of days.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.330
That's not what I meant.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.006
Don't act like you know
what Fury had me do.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.165
Well, he had you spy on him
for a reason. So, what was it?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.444
Fury was concerned about Coulson
finding out the truth.

30:57.560 --> 31:01.007
The doctors felt it would have
negative consequences.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.448
Like what? Like he'd go crazy?
Spontaneously combust or something?

31:04.520 --> 31:06.010
It's not clear.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.050
All I know is he seemed stable.
Until today.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.249
And now he has us in the middle
of nowhere chasing ghosts.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.321
That's because his whole world
fell apart.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.290
He's not alone in that.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.445
This is it.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.726
There's gotta be something here.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.083
Stay alert. Eyes open.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.049
It's gotta be here somewhere.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.205
How long should we look before
thinking about heading back?

31:50.280 --> 31:54.604
We're not going back. Not until we find
whatever Fury has waiting for us.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.331
- What about the satellite?
-it doesn't matter.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.880
The bus used all its remaining fuel
just to get us here.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.768
Did you know this before flying us
out into the middle of nowhere?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.569
It was the right play.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.371
Fury sent us these coordinates
for a reason.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.090
And what reason is that?

32:11.160 --> 32:13.162
I don't know, May! I don't know.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.645
There's gotta be something here!

32:17.720 --> 32:20.883
This means something!
This has to mean something.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.966
The world needs us.
HYDRA is out there.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.522
We cannot let them win.
We cannot let them define us.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.728
Do you understand that?

32:33.720 --> 32:35.529
We are not agents of nothing!

32:35.640 --> 32:38.962
We are Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
and that still carries weight.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.010
It has to carry weight after
everything we've been through.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.445
That carries weight!

33:04.560 --> 33:05.561
I'm sorry.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.371
Get down! Get down!

33:23.080 --> 33:24.684
Well, it seems like we found it.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.526
Nobody move.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.206
I really don't think
that's going to be a problem.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.890
This is a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.644
Shoot first, ask questions later?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.131
Doesn't sound like S.H.I.E.L.D. to me.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.965
It's not HYDRA.
This is Fury reaching out.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.731
There's no way to know that for sure.

33:48.800 --> 33:49.926
There's one way.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.449
- Phil, don't!
-No!

33:53.920 --> 33:54.921
Phil!

34:00.040 --> 34:01.565
Identify yourself.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.246
I'm Phil Coulson, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.884
Welcome, Agent Coulson.
We've been expecting you.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.601
I've never been so happy to
buy a man a steak dinner in my life.

34:23.679 --> 34:24.886
Wait till you see the bill.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.206
Why the long face?

34:27.520 --> 34:29.409
There's a complication
with the hard drive.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.842
I don't like complications.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.810
This one involves Skye.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.402
We had three teams try to hack it,

34:38.480 --> 34:40.083
but she programmed it to erase all data

34:40.159 --> 34:42.400
if anyone other than her
attempts to access it.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.049
Of course she did.

34:45.159 --> 34:48.322
In case it fell into
the wrong hands, I guess.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.206
You know what that means, Romeo?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.446
What is this place?

35:03.520 --> 35:05.443
One of Fury's secret bases.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.927
Ah, I call it Providence.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.809
Although, technically,
it doesn't have a name

35:11.920 --> 35:13.843
because technically it doesn't exist,

35:13.920 --> 35:16.082
it being a secret base and all.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.163
If everyone would follow me...

35:36.120 --> 35:37.485
Pretty cool, huh?

35:38.440 --> 35:40.841
I'm sorry. Who are you exactly?

35:41.400 --> 35:44.051
Eric Koenig, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
Level 6.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.840
Phil Coulson.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.001
I know. I know, it is an honor
to meet you, Agent Coulson.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.321
And I apologize for the kerfuffle outside.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.164
The Precision Remote System

35:54.240 --> 35:57.244
was designed to destroy any
rapidly moving metallic object.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.446
It was my badge.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.929
It was...
Okay, that's gonna be tough to replace.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.925
But, very soon, you're gonna
be issued your very own lanyard.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.490
Lanyards for others

36:10.560 --> 36:14.246
will be distributed
on a case-by-case basis.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.921
What happened to Director Fury?
Is he alive?

36:20.960 --> 36:24.362
Fury didn't make it out of DC.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.170
It's been rough.
We're all a little shaken up.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.811
Especially now that
the Fridge has fallen.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.523
- Who is she calling?
-We had a man at the Fridge.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.846
Ward? Thank God.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.365
Can I speak to you in private?

36:51.120 --> 36:52.963
It's nice having company.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.964
Don't get me wrong, I mean,
this place is great.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.485
What's with the windows?

36:57.560 --> 37:01.645
Oh, that's supposed to make
the isolation more bearable.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.485
Every day of the week, a different view.

37:04.880 --> 37:08.168
Wednesday's pretty terrific
if you like topless beaches.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.561
So, how long have you been in here?

37:10.640 --> 37:14.326
- Since the Chitauri invaded New York.
-Oh.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.523
Oh, it's not so bad.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.921
Reading a ton of historical fiction.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.286
Gaming online with my brother.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.728
We're racking up major
Call of Duty hours. You play?

37:24.160 --> 37:27.289
Of course. Lately, not so much.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.642
So, was there something
you wanted to tell me?

37:31.360 --> 37:34.045
Yes, my bad. Fury is not dead.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.280
- What?
-Yeah.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.170
HYDRA thinks they killed him,
but he managed to escape from DC.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.924
So you just lied to my team.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.401
Well, I don't know them.
And those are Fury's direct orders.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.721
Only a select few people
can know that he's alive.

37:45.800 --> 37:49.247
Maria Hill, Cap, a couple of
others, and now, you and me.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.287
Where is he now?

37:50.360 --> 37:52.840
No one knows, ever since he went dark,
no one's heard from him.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.764
This is highest priority
Full Eclipse Protocol.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.285
No one else can know.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.804
I'm not comfortable keeping
secrets from my team.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.649
Well, they haven't been vetted.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.246
And if you talk,
we're gonna have a major problem.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.761
Are you threatening me?

38:05.840 --> 38:08.411
100%. Fury's orders.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.884
Not big on the trust, is he?

38:12.280 --> 38:13.645
So we're good?

38:14.720 --> 38:15.801
We're good.

38:15.880 --> 38:16.961
Great!

38:17.040 --> 38:18.644
I'm gonna get you set up
with the lanyard.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.007
Maybe ask Agent May
to pull the plane in.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.765
I've got a parking space for it
and everything.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.164
All right, see you soon.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.402
A secret base, huh?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.882
Sounds just like Fury.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.566
Skye confirmed.
Fury's out of the picture.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.441
Well, that is good news.
Gives us one less thing to worry about.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.602
Listen, about the girl...

38:43.680 --> 38:44.966
Look, I know how much it means to you.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.006
I'll get it done.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.161
Hey-

38:48.560 --> 38:50.722
We all have our weaknesses.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.449
The heart wants what it wants.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.282
We can't control everything.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.804
So, if you can do it the easy way
without blowing your cover,

38:59.880 --> 39:01.006
then by all means.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.845
I just need some time alone
with her to get the information.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.571
You'll have it. Coulson will be busy.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.246
I'll give you 24 hours to get
the password and get out.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.687
After that, well,

39:11.760 --> 39:13.922
cross off the team
and bring the girl to me.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.882
- You got your story straight?
-Yeah.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.281
We just need to make it believable.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.406
Who are you?

39:36.680 --> 39:39.206
Grant Ward, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.364
Who? Make me believe.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.369
Grant Ward, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.404
Identify yourself.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.131
Grant Ward, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

40:03.440 --> 40:06.569
Welcome, Agent Ward.
We've been expecting you.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.129
Thought you might've given me
bad directions.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.443
At least the machine gun
didn't start shooting at you.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.846
You Okay?

40:20.520 --> 40:22.568
Ah. It's just a scratch.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.845
Maybe a broken rib or two.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.883
Come on.
Simmons should take a look at you.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.049
Then maybe we can get that drink.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.726
Deal.

40:51.520 --> 40:54.251
You? You have to be kidding me.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.044
I've been in a cell smaller
than my shoe closet.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.884
I wasn't allowed to eat with a fork.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.001
Which would've been worse

41:01.080 --> 41:03.606
if I had been allowed to eat anything
but meatloaf.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.804
I did just bust you out.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.611
Yeah, out of a prison you put me in!

41:10.200 --> 41:12.931
Do you know what my life was like
before I met you?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.526
It was really nice.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.967
But because of you,
I've had my assets frozen,

41:18.040 --> 41:19.166
I've been beaten,

41:19.240 --> 41:21.811
you almost ripped my tongue
out of my mouth!

41:21.880 --> 41:24.645
But I didn't. I'm regretting that now.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.370
Yeah, and all that for a fake.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.649
Raina here, she told me
the truth about "The Clairvoyant."

41:31.720 --> 41:33.085
He didn't respond well.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.162
Hey, I bought it. That's on me.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.766
But you're crazy if you think I'm gonna
do another damn thing for you.

41:38.640 --> 41:39.766
You didn't tell him?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.089
I didn't wanna spoil the surprise.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.844
It's true I'm not gifted, Quinn.

41:46.920 --> 41:50.686
But that doesn't mean
I don't have a special gift just for you.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.970
My Gravitonium.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.044
That's all you got to say?

42:16.720 --> 42:19.291
- Thank you.
-That's more like it.
