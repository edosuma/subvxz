01:13.070 --> 01:17.100
You're doing a good job.
Do just what I do.

01:17.189 --> 01:22.340
Real gentle, easy strokes. Perfect.
Looks good. Now go against the grain.

01:22.429 --> 01:25.019
I don't have a grain.

01:25.909 --> 01:29.140
That means you can go both ways.

01:29.229 --> 01:31.979
Don't shave your lips.
Don't do that.

01:32.070 --> 01:35.019
Now that's what I call a manly shave.

01:37.229 --> 01:40.419
- Brad, stay out of your mother's stuff.
- I just want a hairbrush.

01:40.509 --> 01:43.179
A hairbrush?

01:43.269 --> 01:46.179
You never brush your hair.
What's going on?

01:46.269 --> 01:49.739
It's for his girlfriend,
Jennifer Sudarsky.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.699
- Shut up, you dink.
- Easy, easy.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.979
What does Mom do
with all this junk?

01:55.070 --> 01:58.769
Number one, it's not junk.
It's women's stuff.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.060
It's what makes women
diﬀerent than us.

02:03.150 --> 02:06.300
What's this one for?

02:06.989 --> 02:09.739
I think she pinches something
with that thing.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.739
Oh, this is for taking her eye out
and cleaning behind it.

02:13.830 --> 02:18.019
- Why does Mom have all this stuff?
- Yeah. She always looks the same.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.540
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

02:21.030 --> 02:25.860
Women, as we know them.
are born without a face.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.580
- Bull!
- Listen to me.

02:30.669 --> 02:33.739
Women are like a Mr Potato Head.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.380
Yes,

02:35.469 --> 02:40.939
You've heard your mom say. ''Excuse me.
I gotta go upstairs and put my face on.''

02:41.030 --> 02:42.300
Huh?

02:42.390 --> 02:47.409
She scurries up here
and draws one on with this stuff.

02:47.509 --> 02:52.860
- How does she do it?
- She outlines it like this… Perfect.

02:54.509 --> 02:59.140
Then she fills it in
with this goop right here.

02:59.229 --> 03:01.380
Just like this.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.630
Dad, you look like Nana.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.939
No, if I were Nana. I'd have
the lipstick all over my teeth.

03:22.390 --> 03:28.060
What is it about our bathroom
that fascinates you guys so much?

03:28.150 --> 03:30.419
It's just way cleaner than ours.

03:30.509 --> 03:33.499
You can leave now.
Go get ready for school. Go on.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.580
Mark, honey?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.459
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

03:39.550 --> 03:41.340
Nice lips.

03:42.949 --> 03:44.259
Ewww!

03:44.350 --> 03:46.729
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Come on. Come on.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.290
What is all this
shaving gunk in the sink?

03:49.390 --> 03:52.380
That's not mine. It's Mark's.
Mark!

03:52.469 --> 03:56.580
What I wouldn't give
for mo sinks in here.

03:56.669 --> 04:00.739
We've talked about this long enough.
I'm gonna put another sink in this room.

04:00.830 --> 04:05.419
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you're not.
- It's not that big a job. It's a small job.

04:05.509 --> 04:09.620
There is no such thing
as a small job with you, Tim.

04:09.709 --> 04:14.459
You'd start with the sink, then you'd be
ripping out walls and installing a subway.

04:14.550 --> 04:17.620
- I'd give you free tickets.
- Oh, honey, honey, honey.

04:17.709 --> 04:21.620
If we had mo sinks, we wouldn't
be able to snuggle up at our mutual sink.

04:21.709 --> 04:24.820
Think about this.
With mo sinks. I could sit at my sink.

04:24.909 --> 04:28.019
I could go over to your sink.
do the snuggle thing.

04:28.110 --> 04:31.650
and then take a subway back to my sink.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.060
No.

04:40.509 --> 04:43.019
- Hi. Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

04:43.110 --> 04:46.499
- What did you do to your hair?
- Nothing.

04:47.909 --> 04:50.620
Well, then somebody put a curse on you.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.259
Mom!

04:53.630 --> 04:57.499
Jennifer Sudarsky told Pete Schybner
that she likes spiked hair.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.340
- And does she?
- Big time.

05:01.150 --> 05:06.140
Well. I think it makes you look
incredibly handsome.

05:13.390 --> 05:15.419
- Hey, sharp.
- Like my hair?

05:15.509 --> 05:18.140
No. I mean it's sharp.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.739
funny. Dad.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.259
What is this?

05:23.350 --> 05:27.860
Do you remember when we got married.
I promised to make you a happy woman?

05:27.949 --> 05:30.820
Yeah. I'm still waiting.

05:31.949 --> 05:36.179
- I got some brochures from Sinks R Us.
- You just don't quit, do you?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.820
And to go along with those sinks.

05:37.909 --> 05:40.939
all the materials needed
to make the bathroom of your dreams.

05:41.030 --> 05:46.380
Tim, we are not gonna remodel
the bathroom. It is fine just the way it is.

05:46.469 --> 05:51.330
Jill, in five short days, no muss, no fuss.
I can put in mo sinks, a couple of mirrors.

05:51.429 --> 05:54.860
even a little makeup area where
you can apply whatever gook you want.

05:54.949 --> 05:57.060
I am not interested.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.380
Including a brand-new whirlpool.

06:00.469 --> 06:03.060
A whirlpool.

06:03.150 --> 06:04.900
That is right. Mrs Taylor.

06:04.989 --> 06:11.060
Let the six jets of the Turbomatic 5000
simultaneously massage your cares away

06:11.150 --> 06:13.140
and clean those dirty pores.

06:13.229 --> 06:14.659
The perfect place to rest and relax

06:14.749 --> 06:17.179
after managing that horrible family
you call the Taylors.

06:17.269 --> 06:21.259
Oh, Tim. I would love to have
this dream bathroom…

06:21.350 --> 06:23.810
Look at that one.
But no.

06:23.909 --> 06:27.179
There's no way we can aﬀord this.

06:27.949 --> 06:31.900
This can be a special Too/ Time
project remodeling.

06:31.989 --> 06:34.060
and they can use our bathroom.

06:34.150 --> 06:38.459
Which means they will pay for all of the
labour and almost half of the materials.

06:38.550 --> 06:41.259
- They'd pay for it?
- Yes.

06:42.630 --> 06:46.219
What's to think about? We've always
wanted this done. They'd pay for it.

06:46.310 --> 06:49.380
- Let me do this for you.
- Will Al be here?

06:49.469 --> 06:51.499
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

06:51.590 --> 06:53.499
Will Al be here?

06:53.590 --> 06:57.499
I want you to listen to me.
Al is my assistant. He assists me.

06:57.590 --> 07:01.620
- Yeah. I know. Will he be here?
- Yes.

07:02.229 --> 07:06.459
- And I can have anything I want?
- Anything you want.

07:06.550 --> 07:09.459
What if I decide that
I just want you right now?

07:09.550 --> 07:12.939
Well, it would be diﬀicult
without Al here to assist me.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.939
Hey, give it back, dog breath!

07:20.590 --> 07:23.979
''I think you're really cute
and I love your spiked hair.''

07:24.070 --> 07:26.140
Randy, give me that. Come on.

07:26.229 --> 07:29.259
Hey, hey, hey!
It's all right. It's all right.

07:29.350 --> 07:32.100
- It even smells like a girl.
- So do you!

07:32.189 --> 07:33.409
- So do you!
- So do you!

07:33.509 --> 07:36.380
Guys, guys, come on.

07:36.469 --> 07:40.900
Brad, this is so sweet. I wore this
same perfume when I was a little girl.

07:40.989 --> 07:44.019
It's called ''Tinkerbell''.

07:44.110 --> 07:46.739
I think you've found
a very special young lady.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.900
I think she found
a very special case of cooties.

07:49.989 --> 07:52.060
Randy!

07:52.150 --> 07:57.140
- Mark. I thought you were gonna help me.
- Mom. I'd like to watch them fight.

07:59.949 --> 08:03.699
All right. Bathroom's up to your left.
Holler when you get all set up.

08:03.790 --> 08:06.219
Jill, this is so exciting.
We're about ready to start the show.

08:06.310 --> 08:08.820
I need that sample tile
we picked out last night.

08:08.909 --> 08:11.540
- I changed my mind.
- We decided on misty mint.

08:11.630 --> 08:13.580
I hate misty mint.

08:13.669 --> 08:16.739
Honey, you've been through
a thousand samples in three days.

08:16.830 --> 08:21.739
You're losing it. I got a show to do. We
need a sample. You gotta make a decision.

08:21.830 --> 08:25.580
- I can't. Which one of these do you like?
- I don't care.

08:25.669 --> 08:28.019
I do care. I do.

08:28.110 --> 08:30.459
Oh, boy, do I care.

08:30.550 --> 08:33.698
Which one of these colors do you like?

08:33.789 --> 08:35.780
Oh, jeez.

08:39.188 --> 08:42.299
These are diﬀerent colors?

08:42.390 --> 08:46.979
Apricot, peach, cantaloupe.
loquat and kumquat.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.780
We'll have a fruit salad in the bathroom.

08:48.870 --> 08:51.939
No, Tim! We gotta live with these colors
for the rest of our lives.

08:52.030 --> 08:55.179
How long could that be?

08:55.269 --> 08:57.830
All right, just take your gear
up to the bathroom.

08:57.909 --> 09:01.939
- Al, maybe you can help me.
- Like he's gonna know anything.

09:02.030 --> 09:04.100
Come here.
Come here, come here.

09:04.749 --> 09:08.060
Which one of these colors do you like?

09:09.469 --> 09:12.100
I like the loquat or the kumquat.

09:12.189 --> 09:16.340
Come oﬀ of it, Al. Like you can
tell the diﬀerence with these colors.

09:16.429 --> 09:18.300
Yes, I can, Tim.

09:18.390 --> 09:22.739
The loquat is sunnier.
yet understated in a nonthreatening way.

09:32.350 --> 09:35.820
Hi, welcome to Too/ Time.
I'm Tim Taylor, your host.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.939
Today is a special program -
it takes place in my own home.

09:39.030 --> 09:41.739
Here's my lovely wife. Jill.

09:44.989 --> 09:47.290
And of course.
we all know my assistant.

09:47.390 --> 09:49.580
Howdy.Doody,

09:49.669 --> 09:50.979
follow me this way.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.459
We're gonna be doing a five-day
redecoration of my own bathroom.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.699
Before we get started. Let's meet
our master plumber, Felix Myman.

09:57.790 --> 10:00.419
- Glad to be here, Tim.
- Good to have you, Felix.

10:00.509 --> 10:03.100
- Al, let's get to work.
- All right.

10:03.189 --> 10:06.219
As you can see.
we've taken out our old vanity and sink.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.689
and we'll be replacing it
with a new double sink model.

10:08.790 --> 10:13.540
That's right, Al. We'll be covering that sink
and backsplash with this lovely pinkish tile.

10:13.630 --> 10:16.340
I believe that shade is called kumquat.

10:16.429 --> 10:19.459
It's ephemeral, yet graceful.

10:19.550 --> 10:22.009
Just like you, Al.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.289
We removed the vanity, and I found out
I had existing galvanized pipes.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.260
I want to redo those with new copper.

10:30.349 --> 10:33.099
In order to do that.
I have to remove this section of the wall.

10:33.189 --> 10:37.539
And for that,
I decided to use a 20lb sledge.

10:41.829 --> 10:46.260
Tim, I think you might want to use our
sabre saw here to cut out that piece of wall.

10:46.349 --> 10:51.470
That might make a cleaner, more eﬀicient
cutout, but what would be the fun in that?

10:51.550 --> 10:54.700
Part of the fun of home remodeling
is taking out some aggressions.

10:54.789 --> 10:59.579
And there's no better way do that
than using a 20lb sledge.

11:02.309 --> 11:04.139
Give way, Al.

11:04.229 --> 11:06.300
Well, Tim,

11:06.389 --> 11:10.340
- be careful when you're using a sledge…
- I know that, Al.

11:10.430 --> 11:15.059
- …not to go all the way through the wall.
- Why would I do that, Al?

11:25.590 --> 11:27.740
Al, Al.

11:27.829 --> 11:30.939
Did I get that piece of sausage
out of my front tooth?

11:31.030 --> 11:33.220
Yes, you did, Tim.

11:33.550 --> 11:35.340
Dad!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.979
I think Mom's getting ready
to scream again.

11:39.070 --> 11:42.459
Oh, no. She saw that
concrete spill in the hallway.

11:42.550 --> 11:45.300
No. We made Mark lie on top of it.

11:47.630 --> 11:49.340
Don't you worry about Mom.

11:49.430 --> 11:55.099
Once she sees this whirlpool.
she won't be thinking about anything else.

11:55.189 --> 11:56.740
- Ready to go?
- Yep.

11:56.829 --> 11:59.619
In five, four…

12:01.550 --> 12:04.260
Boy, that sausage was spicy.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.820
three,

12:10.910 --> 12:12.300
two,

12:12.389 --> 12:13.700
one.

12:13.789 --> 12:16.139
We're in the final step
of our bathroom redo,

12:16.229 --> 12:19.340
and that's where we install
this beautiful whirlpool bath.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.180
To do that
we take it out of the crate,

12:21.269 --> 12:25.139
we march it through this door, on upstairs,
and we plumb it with Felix, our plumber.

12:25.229 --> 12:28.059
- There's Felix right now. Hey.
- Hey, Tim.

12:28.150 --> 12:31.539
We can't get the whirlpool up the stairs.
Somebody measured it wrong.

12:31.630 --> 12:35.099
I was the one that…
Hey, turn that… Get that oﬀ. Cut. Cut.

12:35.789 --> 12:40.059
Hey. I told my wife
we'd have it up there today. Today.

12:41.389 --> 12:46.660
The only way to get it up in that bathroom
is we gotta hoist it up to the roof…

12:46.749 --> 12:47.729
What?

12:47.829 --> 12:51.700
..tear a hole in that wall
and slide her in.

12:51.789 --> 12:54.459
- Let us know.
- Tim!

12:54.550 --> 12:57.539
That'll be a break.
Let's go. Phil.

12:59.829 --> 13:03.059
They broke the mirror, they put
the wrong tile in, we got a cement…

13:03.150 --> 13:05.380
Oh, whoa, whoa. What is this?

13:05.470 --> 13:09.010
This is what will make it all worthwhile.
Your new whirlpool.

13:09.110 --> 13:13.539
Oh. Tim! It is so beautiful.

13:13.630 --> 13:15.900
Look at the color.
It's perfect.

13:15.990 --> 13:19.220
Not to mention seven adjustable jets.

13:19.309 --> 13:22.849
Three speeds: low, medium.
and ''Who needs a man?''

13:25.389 --> 13:27.380
Well…

13:30.150 --> 13:33.220
What are we waiting for? Let's get the guys
and take it up to the bathroom.

13:33.309 --> 13:38.019
Well.., darn it. Jill. The guys and I decided
not to take it right up to the bathroom.

13:38.910 --> 13:44.260
- Well, how are you gonna get it up there?
- See that spot up there? further. OK, now.

13:44.349 --> 13:46.220
Picture, if you will.

13:46.309 --> 13:51.019
Looking out of your whirlpool tub
through a brand-new greenhouse window.

13:51.110 --> 13:54.380
All I gotta do is
cut a little hole in the wall there.

13:54.470 --> 13:57.860
A little hole about the size of this tub?

13:58.430 --> 14:02.099
Just a little bigger than the tub, actually.

14:02.189 --> 14:07.019
Tim! How could you order a tub
and have no way to get it in the house?

14:07.110 --> 14:10.220
Because in the catalog
they're only like this big.

14:13.070 --> 14:15.180
Wilson. I need more hose.

14:15.269 --> 14:17.860
Don't we all. Tim.

14:21.910 --> 14:25.530
Just tell me where the window is.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.419
Back-ordered?

14:27.510 --> 14:33.180
How many idiots order a greenhouse
window in the middle of November?

14:33.269 --> 14:36.860
What do you mean,
you guess one more?

14:36.950 --> 14:40.419
Dad, what are you doing on the phone?
I'm expecting a call.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.820
I'll be oﬀ in a minute.
I need that window here today.

14:43.910 --> 14:47.450
I live with a very dangerous woman.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.180
Thank you.

14:49.269 --> 14:52.419
Think fast.
Who's calling you so early?

14:52.510 --> 14:56.579
Joey said Jennifer Sudarsky's gonna
call me this morning before school.

14:56.669 --> 14:58.499
Whoa.

14:58.590 --> 15:01.619
first call from a girl.
Pretty scary stuff.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.860
You said it.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.619
Go for it.

15:16.189 --> 15:17.900
Hello?

15:20.349 --> 15:21.939
Sure.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.740
Bye'

15:30.550 --> 15:32.619
She wants to sit next to me on the bus.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.700
- Life is good.
- Yes!

15:35.789 --> 15:39.300
Tim, what did you do to the water?

15:39.389 --> 15:42.459
Nothing, Felix and the crew
ran into a technical problem.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.939
What technical problem?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.979
I don't know.
They had to shut the water oﬀ.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.300
But don't worry. I ran a hose from Wilson's
yard, now we've got running water.

15:50.389 --> 15:53.419
- This is freezing cold.
- Heat it up on the stove.

15:53.510 --> 15:54.860
Oh. God.

15:54.950 --> 15:59.300
Hey, Tim, you know
that water main you busted?

16:04.150 --> 16:08.579
You busted? I thought you said
it was a technical problem.

16:08.669 --> 16:11.860
Technically. I was the problem. Jill.

16:11.950 --> 16:15.139
I got good news. We capped oﬀ
that geyser in the front yard.

16:15.229 --> 16:17.459
- Geyser?
- There is no more geyser.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.900
Of course, your front yard's flooded.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.450
I'm gonna have a couple of men
sandbag that basement window.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.780
The stove won't light.
What did you do to it?

16:24.869 --> 16:28.410
- Nothing.
- That was us. We had to shut the gas oﬀ.

16:28.510 --> 16:32.380
- Why?
- When you broke open that water main.

16:32.470 --> 16:36.660
we were afraid you hit the gas line too.
so we shut them both oﬀ to be safe.

16:36.749 --> 16:38.499
Should we worry?

16:38.590 --> 16:42.499
No. It's not like you're gonna
get blown up or something.

16:42.590 --> 16:45.380
- That's it. I'm going to a motel…
- Jill, come on!

16:45.470 --> 16:48.579
..until you finish the bathroom
or destroy the house.

16:48.669 --> 16:50.740
It won't take long to fix the water main.

16:50.829 --> 16:53.419
All I wanted was your shaving gunk
out of the sink.

16:53.510 --> 16:57.260
A sponge could've done that.
It was gonna be one day, then five days.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.459
Now it's what? 17 days, Tim.
And what have I got?

17:00.550 --> 17:04.089
I got a hole in the side of the house,
a geyser in the front yard,

17:04.189 --> 17:09.130
no water, subzero temperatures.
and a chance to blow up.

17:09.749 --> 17:12.618
Honey. I think you're overreacting.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.630
- Hi-ho, Tim.
- Hi, Wilson.

17:32.720 --> 17:37.150
- Get your water back on?
- finally. Here's your end of the hose.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.549
Thank you, neighbor.
Beautiful night, isn't it?

17:40.640 --> 17:44.990
- Crisp, clear and cold.
- What are you up to?

17:45.079 --> 17:48.509
Just checking
the expanding universe, Tim.

17:49.039 --> 17:53.430
- You got a minute?
- Cut your boosters. Come in for a landing.

17:53.519 --> 17:58.539
I did it this time. Jill took the kids, left me,
and went to a motel with them.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.230
Mm-mm-mm.

18:00.319 --> 18:05.259
I don't know what gets into me. This started
out a simple project to replace a sink.

18:05.359 --> 18:08.230
Then I add mo sinks.
I rip out the wall. Boom, bang.

18:08.319 --> 18:10.670
I got pipes everywhere, water flowing out.

18:10.759 --> 18:14.349
I got the water main shut oﬀ…
I can't stop this.

18:14.440 --> 18:19.589
Well, Tim, you're probably just responding
to the visceral male urge to create.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.029
Visceral? Vis… Vis… Visceral?

18:25.119 --> 18:27.269
Let's just say gut need.

18:27.359 --> 18:32.150
That's exactly what it feels like.
It's a visceral gut thing.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.630
I like to create. Wilson. Everything I do.
I want to make bigger and better.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.789
This obsessive desire to create

18:38.880 --> 18:43.589
partly happens
because men feel inferior to women.

18:46.480 --> 18:51.910
- It's because we can't bear children.
- I don't mind the boys that much.

18:56.079 --> 19:00.990
No, Tim. What I mean is,
women can give birth and we can't.

19:01.519 --> 19:06.309
- We sure lucked out on that part.
- Well, I don't know, Tim.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.470
You were there when your boys
were born. Birth is a miracle.

19:10.559 --> 19:13.119
Maybe one of the reasons
you get so involved in your projects

19:13.200 --> 19:18.349
is because you want to create something
as wondrous as human life.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.710
That's a neat thought, Wilson.

19:23.799 --> 19:29.150
But the way this project's going,
I think giving birth would've been easier.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.190
Tim, I think you have company.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.660
- Thank you, Wilson.
- Good night, neighbor.

19:42.559 --> 19:44.190
Hi.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.029
Hi.

19:48.039 --> 19:51.660
Thought you and the boys
were staying at that motel.

19:51.759 --> 19:56.750
I was, but every time
I went into the bathroom there

19:56.839 --> 20:02.549
and looked into the sink and didn't see
your shaving stubble, I got depressed.

20:03.599 --> 20:06.670
I really missed you.

20:06.759 --> 20:11.670
I decided that I'd rather have you
and no water than water and no you.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.819
Now you have us both.
The water's on, and here I am.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.220
I'm sorry I got mad and left.

20:18.319 --> 20:20.509
That's OK.

20:20.599 --> 20:24.750
You know, it wasn't you that I was mad at.
It was just the remodel.

20:24.839 --> 20:26.829
No, no.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.430
I can't give birth.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.670
It's a problem in my gut
with a visceral thing.

20:44.559 --> 20:47.549
It's really, really hard to explain.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.029
Don't try.

20:52.079 --> 20:54.539
You want to see your new bathroom?

20:54.640 --> 20:57.349
Is it finished?

21:02.759 --> 21:06.589
Well, it didn't come out
exactly like I planned…

21:12.000 --> 21:15.230
but I'm sure it's not what you want.

21:17.279 --> 21:20.470
- The grout's still a little messy…
- Shh! It's perfect.

21:20.559 --> 21:24.630
- You really think so?
- It's even better than I imagined. Oh, Tim.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.029
Look at this bull-nose tile
all along the sink here.

21:28.119 --> 21:33.470
And back here I pushed the closet back to
give you an inset for your perfume bottles.

21:33.559 --> 21:37.029
And that's not the best. All chrome-plated
brass hinges and fixtures…

21:37.119 --> 21:40.069
Shh-shh. Let me just enjoy it.

21:40.160 --> 21:45.309
Oh, look. This is so lovely
with the moonlight.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.869
This is the most romantic
bathroom on Earth.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.710
That's not the most romantic part.

21:53.799 --> 21:57.579
Watch this.
This is truly a woman's bathroom.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.869
Seat up.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.420
Flush.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.230
Mom, when are you coming out?
I'm hungry.

22:21.319 --> 22:23.390
It's not funny any more, Mom.

22:23.480 --> 22:27.150
Mom, you've been in there
for seven hours.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.509
We've run out of
bad things to do.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.710
Boys, clear out.
It's time for what now?

22:32.799 --> 22:34.789
More power!

22:34.880 --> 22:36.990
All right.

22:37.079 --> 22:42.269
All right, Mrs Taylor, we have that
whirlpool surrounded. Get outta there!

22:42.359 --> 22:45.549
You're turning into a human prune.
Get outta that tub.

22:46.359 --> 22:49.670
Honey, I wait a week, I start dating.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.950
It didn't come out quite like I planned it.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.589
Well, it didn't come out
exactly like I planned it.

23:12.799 --> 23:16.190
Well, it didn't come out
exactly like I planned it.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.710
Hello?

23:26.079 --> 23:30.940
There. It's just delayed.
Come on in, honey. What the hell.
