00:00.060 --> 00:01.817
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.189 --> 00:04.027
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- So you created me.

00:07.783 --> 00:08.866
He's been shot.

00:11.397 --> 00:13.704
<i>I got accepted into
a music program in New York.</i>

00:13.893 --> 00:15.873
- I leave in two days.
- Two days?

00:15.993 --> 00:18.542
What if your father's trying
to communicate something through me?

00:18.662 --> 00:20.335
<i>You're really communicating with him.</i>

00:20.978 --> 00:22.141
Entire ZZYZX databank.

00:22.261 --> 00:24.798
All of our research,
everything we've ever done or recorded,

00:25.100 --> 00:27.276
- It's been copied.
- Copied? Where?

00:28.751 --> 00:31.763
You were the one I could
always open up to. I miss this.

00:31.883 --> 00:32.973
I miss you.

00:33.219 --> 00:34.183
I miss you, too.

00:34.303 --> 00:36.894
<i>- Lori, what's wrong?
- Are you having an affair with Emily?</i>

00:37.247 --> 00:39.005
Take him to Room 237.

00:41.596 --> 00:43.358
Big Tom Foss.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.380
You let them break you, Tom.

00:45.724 --> 00:48.155
- Jessi needs your help.
- She's in danger, isn't she?

00:48.275 --> 00:49.865
Only you can bring her home safely.

00:51.326 --> 00:53.577
<i>What I admire most about you
is your faith in people.</i>

00:53.810 --> 00:55.954
But I worry this time
it's gonna be the end of you.

00:56.074 --> 00:58.511
Why Jessi? How are you two connected?

00:58.683 --> 01:01.659
- She and I are the same.
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:01.844 --> 01:03.212
I don't even know who you are.

01:03.332 --> 01:06.673
- I kept secrets about Kyle...
- I discovered something about Kyle...

01:06.793 --> 01:08.508
You don't have to do what they want.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.302
You can make your own choices.

01:10.422 --> 01:12.095
Now let me help you.

01:12.602 --> 01:13.680
You'll take me back.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.391
We're not going back,
not until this is all over.

01:27.144 --> 01:28.869
<i>I'd risked everything to find her,</i>

01:28.992 --> 01:32.334
<i>my home, my family, their trust.</i>

01:32.656 --> 01:34.953
<i>No one understood why I believed in her.</i>

01:35.681 --> 01:37.919
<i>Even she didn't feel
worthy of my belief.</i>

01:38.866 --> 01:41.140
<i>But I felt somewhere
there must be good in her.</i>

01:41.620 --> 01:43.539
<i>I wasn't sure where we should go,</i>

01:43.994 --> 01:45.921
<i>but we couldn't return home
until we were ready</i>

01:46.041 --> 01:48.174
<i>to face the danger that awaited us.</i>

01:48.581 --> 01:50.839
<i>And I had faith that together
we'd find our way.</i>

02:01.138 --> 02:03.511
No appetite for Madacorp cuisine?

02:08.072 --> 02:10.654
I never expected things to go this far.

02:11.294 --> 02:12.733
I was supposed to...

02:12.978 --> 02:16.785
facilitate the retrieval of data
from one superbrain to the next.

02:17.822 --> 02:21.044
But all I've done
is manipulate a confused girl

02:21.289 --> 02:23.686
and mess with an innocent family.

02:24.694 --> 02:26.895
Now Kyle's run off after Jessi.

02:27.928 --> 02:30.590
Ballantine's ordered me
to dispose of you.

02:41.430 --> 02:43.395
I thought that I was
working for the good guys.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.788
But the collateral damage
doesn't seem warranted.

03:10.543 --> 03:12.731
- Foss, where are you?
- Never mind.

03:13.051 --> 03:14.426
Just keep moving.

03:14.546 --> 03:17.179
<i>- Where? I'm with Jessi, I don't know...
- Shut up and listen.</i>

03:17.694 --> 03:19.264
You already know where to go.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.141
<i>It's someplace safe.</i>

03:21.394 --> 03:22.934
You have all you need.

03:23.238 --> 03:24.561
What are you talking about?

03:24.971 --> 03:26.152
You heard me.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.897
<i>I'll catch up to you.</i>

03:28.020 --> 03:31.033
No. I want you to stay
and look after my family.

03:32.643 --> 03:34.071
Foss, will you do it?

03:34.614 --> 03:37.115
Yeah. Now just get rid of your phone.

03:37.736 --> 03:39.826
<i>- What?
- Kyle, your phone.</i>

03:40.553 --> 03:41.844
I said kill it.

03:48.914 --> 03:51.213
You were right to tell me
that Jessi was gone.

03:51.692 --> 03:53.450
But now we've lost both of them.

03:54.342 --> 03:56.279
I thought Foss would
lead us straight to them.

03:56.412 --> 03:58.053
You underestimated him.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.971
I'm getting tired of waiting.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.975
- I'll find another way.
- You'd better, and quickly.

04:04.706 --> 04:06.311
Now get the hell out of my office.

04:25.528 --> 04:28.198
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 13:
Leap Of Faith</font>

04:31.716 --> 04:33.230
We can't call the police,

04:33.353 --> 04:34.373
not yet.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.341
Well, we can't just sit here.

04:36.673 --> 04:40.429
Our former security guard is locked up
at Madacorp by Kyle's parents' lawyer.

04:40.549 --> 04:42.514
Obviously, something is very wrong.

04:43.402 --> 04:45.371
- That's an understatement.
- I know you're upset,

04:45.491 --> 04:47.602
but let's try to
make sense of things first.

04:48.327 --> 04:49.896
Let Kyle find Jessi.

04:50.110 --> 04:51.672
What does that have to do with it?

04:51.807 --> 04:53.859
Everything is connected somehow.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.195
- Hopefully, Kyle can explain.
- But will he?

04:58.546 --> 05:00.740
He's been hiding things,
and you've been helping him.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.358
You knew he rescued a girl from a fire
without getting so much as a blister.

05:06.948 --> 05:08.874
It took you how many months
to mention it to me?

05:08.994 --> 05:11.280
He was afraid they would take him away.

05:12.226 --> 05:14.337
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.242
Well, I'm not anyone.

05:18.053 --> 05:19.092
I'm your husband.

05:21.172 --> 05:22.853
There's trouble in paradise.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.029
Go away.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.862
I'm serious. I heard Mom and Dad
fighting about something,

05:26.996 --> 05:29.561
and I haven't done anything lately,
so what's it about?

05:31.452 --> 05:33.190
I don't know.
They didn't send me a memo.

05:34.344 --> 05:37.042
We need Kyle to tune in
and do a little recon for us,

05:37.165 --> 05:38.403
but I can't find him.

05:38.689 --> 05:40.947
Well, he has to be here.
Mom has us on lockdown.

05:41.406 --> 05:43.927
Unless he's added invisibility
to his bag of tricks,

05:44.160 --> 05:45.353
he's not home.

05:45.993 --> 05:47.245
Maybe he went to Amanda's.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.706
Maybe you know where he went.

05:53.935 --> 05:55.337
He went after her, didn't he?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.381
- Went after who?
- She-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.135
How could he do that?

06:02.454 --> 06:04.054
How can you cover for him?

06:05.085 --> 06:07.028
What happened to your cooler head?

06:07.569 --> 06:10.602
She's a horrible, toxic person
who attacked me.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.704
He's not excusing her for what she did.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.273
He just wants to bring her home.

06:16.056 --> 06:17.077
Why?

06:17.703 --> 06:20.113
Why does he have to be
all nice and sympathetic,

06:20.233 --> 06:22.614
going all Kyle on her
when she doesn't deserve it?

06:22.734 --> 06:24.950
You know Kyle. He sees something in her,

06:25.289 --> 06:27.244
and his instincts about people
are always right.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.996
We should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.361
Declan loaned you his car?

06:36.481 --> 06:38.161
I told him I had to find you.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.446
He must be angry,
now that he knows what I did to Lori.

06:43.282 --> 06:44.745
Why did you do that?

06:45.728 --> 06:47.439
How could you hurt her that way?

06:49.411 --> 06:50.574
I don't know.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.270
I couldn't control myself.

06:53.390 --> 06:55.025
What is that supposed to mean?

06:55.320 --> 06:57.410
You couldn't stop yourself
from hitting her?

06:59.703 --> 07:00.834
Sometimes...

07:01.536 --> 07:03.321
a darkness comes over me.

07:07.141 --> 07:08.159
It scares me.

07:11.186 --> 07:13.178
I'm really sorry it happened,

07:13.941 --> 07:15.748
and I know Lori will never forgive me.

07:15.871 --> 07:16.960
She may not.

07:17.924 --> 07:21.268
You have to earn forgiveness.
You can't run from your mistakes.

07:21.391 --> 07:23.091
You said we weren't going back.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.137
Now until we get some answers.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.842
- Where?
- Foss said I have all I need.

07:28.989 --> 07:30.269
What does that mean?

07:31.594 --> 07:33.435
The ring is all you need.

07:33.706 --> 07:35.103
- What?
- Now go.

07:43.224 --> 07:44.328
A ring?

07:45.004 --> 07:46.775
It was a gift from Adam Baylin,

07:47.463 --> 07:48.607
my friend.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.243
He created the experiment.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.038
He doesn't sound like a friend.

07:54.619 --> 07:56.207
He never meant to harm anyone.

08:06.421 --> 08:08.762
They forced him out of ZZYZX
and then killed him.

08:13.531 --> 08:14.976
I don't remember taking this.

08:15.096 --> 08:16.297
That's not us.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.641
That's Adam.

08:20.483 --> 08:22.156
He looks just like you.

08:23.077 --> 08:24.798
- She looks like...
- I know.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.655
And if he created me...

08:27.147 --> 08:28.494
I have to find her.

08:28.614 --> 08:30.241
I have to know who this woman is.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.914
"The light will show you the way. "

08:38.035 --> 08:39.333
You know Hungarian?

08:40.357 --> 08:41.525
I guess so.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.690
The light will show you the way.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.016
It's just a ring.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.811
Nothing is just anything
if it comes from Adam.

09:03.139 --> 09:04.393
There's a hole.

09:05.856 --> 09:07.112
Where? In... In the stone?

09:07.589 --> 09:08.605
No.

09:08.725 --> 09:10.281
In the band behind the stone.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.369
I think this goes way beyond
anything we could have imagined.

09:17.696 --> 09:18.920
When I first lost my job,

09:19.040 --> 09:21.815
all I knew was LWK Software
was bought up by another company.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.868
What does that have to do with anything?

09:24.040 --> 09:27.924
Well, I've been doing some digging,
and the company that bought LWK

09:28.602 --> 09:30.987
is a subsidiary of Madacorp.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.704
- That must be...
- Another coincidence?

09:34.381 --> 09:35.745
Start a list.

09:37.214 --> 09:38.394
Kyle's father?

09:39.095 --> 09:40.644
Here's one about his mom.

09:41.037 --> 09:42.397
I found 15 different articles

09:42.517 --> 09:45.498
on Kyle's parents over the past several
years, all of them glowing tributes.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.095
So what's the problem?

09:47.682 --> 09:48.887
Every one of them

09:49.022 --> 09:51.567
was distributed on the web
on the same day,

09:52.268 --> 09:54.223
like they were deliberately planted.

09:54.764 --> 09:55.784
Why?

09:56.166 --> 09:57.346
I don't know,

09:57.641 --> 09:59.781
but those two showed up out of nowhere.

10:00.014 --> 10:02.091
Those two were his parents.

10:02.362 --> 10:04.427
There was a blood test. They matched.

10:04.776 --> 10:07.756
- And Kyle remembered them.
- Kyle remembered who?

10:08.575 --> 10:10.258
Guys, this is private.

10:10.378 --> 10:12.093
Did you know Kyle went after Jessi?

10:17.026 --> 10:19.434
- How could you let him do that?
- It's complicated.

10:19.554 --> 10:20.602
Try me.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.146
Not now. You're just
going to have to trust us.

10:29.558 --> 10:31.279
Okay, big mouth's gone. What's the deal?

10:31.399 --> 10:32.558
Out.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.811
How is this going to work?

10:42.057 --> 10:44.565
Like a pinhole camera
to view an eclipse.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.585
We position the ring here.

10:48.249 --> 10:49.933
And let the light pass through.

10:51.396 --> 10:52.896
- Hit the switch.
- Okay.

11:08.398 --> 11:09.494
Here.

11:39.788 --> 11:41.558
<i>This map isn't very detailed.</i>

11:42.186 --> 11:44.894
<i>I can't tell if we've passed
Route 12 yet. There's no signs for it.</i>

11:45.912 --> 11:47.188
<i>She must be my mother.</i>

11:49.612 --> 11:50.859
I look so much like her.

11:50.979 --> 11:52.337
Who else could she be?

11:52.473 --> 11:53.948
I wish Adam was alive.

11:54.858 --> 11:55.905
He would know.

11:58.104 --> 11:59.776
Do you think she's still alive?

12:00.863 --> 12:02.920
I mean, if she is,
then I'd have somebody.

12:03.646 --> 12:05.330
There'd be someone like me.

12:09.547 --> 12:10.715
I'm like you.

12:24.263 --> 12:25.685
What's wrong?

12:48.545 --> 12:50.710
Well, well, well.

12:51.115 --> 12:53.421
The young lovebirds return.

13:00.854 --> 13:03.227
Still sneaking around? Huh?

13:03.534 --> 13:04.891
Still the happy couple?

13:06.178 --> 13:08.811
- You... You know us?
- Of course I know you.

13:09.276 --> 13:12.315
You used to hole up in that
booth over there for hours.

13:13.661 --> 13:15.318
I'm sorry. We're just a little confused.

13:15.555 --> 13:18.613
It's not you. My grandfather
gets mixed up sometimes.

13:18.733 --> 13:21.199
I don't get mixed up.
He's grilled cheese, chocolate shake.

13:21.499 --> 13:23.687
She's Cobb salad, cherry cola.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.281
Grandpa, these people
just remind you of someone.

13:27.032 --> 13:28.625
He can't tell you what day it is,

13:28.745 --> 13:31.167
but he remembers his customers'
orders from years ago.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.461
She Could Be You.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.192
- What?
- The two of you

13:36.315 --> 13:37.924
used to play that song all the time.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.294
Why don't you folks have a seat?

13:40.414 --> 13:41.928
Come on. I'll cut you some pie.

13:42.119 --> 13:44.467
- I don't want any pie.
- Come on.

14:02.773 --> 14:05.201
- What is it?
- Third row, fourth one down.

14:09.921 --> 14:10.934
D4.

14:11.832 --> 14:13.184
Do you have a quarter?

14:29.425 --> 14:30.518
It's not there.

14:30.777 --> 14:31.879
Where are you?

14:32.002 --> 14:33.848
<i>In a diner somewhere with Jessi.</i>

14:34.260 --> 14:35.273
You found her?

14:36.659 --> 14:38.776
Yes. Are the Tragers okay?

14:39.008 --> 14:41.204
Not exactly.
Lori's pissed that you went after Jessi,

14:41.324 --> 14:43.031
and apparently
your parents are fighting.

14:43.533 --> 14:44.652
About what?

14:44.836 --> 14:46.472
<i>My best guess would be you.</i>

14:48.350 --> 14:49.454
Has Foss been around?

14:50.686 --> 14:52.248
I asked him to watch over the family.

14:52.913 --> 14:55.209
Then knowing him,
he's probably listening right now.

14:56.607 --> 14:58.365
<i>Listen, you'd better get back here.</i>

14:59.035 --> 15:00.209
<i>I can't yet.</i>

15:01.661 --> 15:03.480
They're gonna want
answers when you get home,

15:03.615 --> 15:04.796
I gotta go.

15:06.025 --> 15:07.138
Was that Kyle?

15:10.340 --> 15:12.103
He's with her right now, isn't he?

15:12.590 --> 15:15.271
Look, I'm feeling kind of
caught in the middle here.

15:15.977 --> 15:18.816
Then free yourself
and tell me what's going on.

15:20.927 --> 15:22.028
I should go.

15:24.996 --> 15:27.223
Okay. Chocolate shake,

15:27.343 --> 15:28.353
cherry cola.

15:28.476 --> 15:29.452
What did I tell you?

15:29.914 --> 15:31.140
It sounded good.

15:32.775 --> 15:34.248
So what are you doing around here?

15:34.728 --> 15:36.334
Looking for Route 12.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.871
Route 12.

15:39.127 --> 15:40.963
A flood washed that out years ago.

15:41.379 --> 15:43.310
What would you want to do up there?

15:43.761 --> 15:44.717
Just exploring.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.261
Well, there's not much to explore.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.846
It's pretty isolated.

15:49.938 --> 15:51.229
I'd be careful.

15:58.951 --> 16:00.598
What if there is nothing there?

16:03.143 --> 16:05.571
There has to be. Otherwise,
Foss wouldn't send us.

16:07.414 --> 16:08.533
You're worried.

16:12.854 --> 16:15.331
When I get home, I have
to tell my family everything.

16:15.853 --> 16:17.269
We don't have to go back.

16:18.481 --> 16:21.462
We can find Route 12,
see what's there, and keep going.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.006
I want to go back.

16:24.757 --> 16:25.792
Why?

16:27.511 --> 16:29.178
They're everything to me.

16:35.666 --> 16:36.739
You...

16:37.526 --> 16:40.690
have people you care about
and who care about you.

16:46.478 --> 16:47.530
Yes.

16:50.658 --> 16:51.703
I do.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.346
You realize we're doing this
without a warrant.

17:01.035 --> 17:03.691
Everything incriminating
will not be held against him.

17:03.838 --> 17:05.141
At least for now.

17:09.703 --> 17:11.142
Socks in the desk?

17:11.498 --> 17:13.429
And porn under the mattress.

17:18.097 --> 17:19.896
Ah. Got it.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.562
One prays for moments like this.

17:30.312 --> 17:31.824
Who'd like to go first?

17:32.033 --> 17:33.868
Give us a free pass on this one.

17:34.505 --> 17:35.611
I think not.

17:35.796 --> 17:37.455
What do you want with my Kyle file?

17:38.012 --> 17:40.208
We just need to borrow it for a while.

17:41.736 --> 17:42.736
Why?

17:44.110 --> 17:46.047
Enough with that.
Why are you skulking around?

17:46.209 --> 17:47.623
Yeah. Skulking's my job.

17:47.746 --> 17:49.750
Don't mess with the balance of nature.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.429
Seriously, if there's something
going on with Kyle, I wanna know.

17:53.732 --> 17:55.346
Well, the truth is...

17:55.494 --> 17:57.571
the situation does concern all of us.

17:58.138 --> 18:00.478
There's a... situation?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.856
All right, we'll tell you what we know.

18:04.698 --> 18:06.137
No more secrets?

18:09.487 --> 18:10.785
No more secrets.

19:19.599 --> 19:20.683
What's in the box?

19:21.382 --> 19:22.439
What?

19:22.906 --> 19:25.598
I saw you with her,
and then I opened the box.

19:26.607 --> 19:27.815
You were inside my mind.

19:28.414 --> 19:29.791
You got into mine.

19:30.356 --> 19:32.445
I guess it works for both of us.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.113
But how did you do it?
We weren't even touching.

19:38.532 --> 19:40.661
You seemed lost in thought. I just...

19:43.390 --> 19:44.582
concentrated.

19:53.017 --> 19:55.176
They want me to get what you
have locked in your brain.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.472
That's what Emily told me. She said
once they have it, I can be free.

19:59.773 --> 20:01.654
Jessi, that information,
it could be dangerous.

20:01.789 --> 20:03.917
- We can't give it to them.
- If I got into your head,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.978
what makes you think I won't take it?

20:06.098 --> 20:07.772
Because I choose to trust you.

20:16.390 --> 20:17.823
I've done terrible things.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.722
Leave me here.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.008
What?

20:25.193 --> 20:27.541
I don't belong with someone like you.

20:28.475 --> 20:30.127
You should go on without me.

20:50.057 --> 20:51.652
You scratched that in.

20:53.691 --> 20:54.735
Grandpa, it's okay.

20:55.981 --> 20:57.863
You never came back after that.

21:00.056 --> 21:01.409
Not till today.

21:03.744 --> 21:04.889
I'm sorry.

21:10.788 --> 21:12.201
What was that about?

21:13.371 --> 21:14.562
I don't know.

21:16.431 --> 21:18.091
But it's part of our history.

21:20.882 --> 21:21.971
We have to find out.

21:24.582 --> 21:26.107
Whatever happens,

21:27.115 --> 21:28.310
we're in this together.

21:33.995 --> 21:35.635
This is like a Kyle convention.

21:36.059 --> 21:37.259
Kyle 101.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.792
A symposium on all things Kyle.

21:40.121 --> 21:42.368
- Kyle-a-con.
- Be serious.

21:42.681 --> 21:44.009
Oh, I've been serious,

21:44.132 --> 21:45.681
and all of you mocked me.

21:45.935 --> 21:48.214
But now you want to study my evidence.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.033
Just give us the file.

21:50.365 --> 21:52.959
Every time something unusual
happened concerning Kyle,

21:53.095 --> 21:55.381
we managed to explain it or overlook it.

21:55.590 --> 21:58.132
- All these incidents have to add up.
- To what?

21:58.429 --> 22:00.050
That's what we're here to figure out.

22:09.557 --> 22:11.812
- What do you want?
- Kyle told me you'd be around.

22:13.036 --> 22:14.982
I think the family start
to put things together.

22:15.372 --> 22:16.516
Yeah, I heard.

22:16.685 --> 22:18.444
What if they find out the truth?

22:19.135 --> 22:21.363
Well, they would, eventually.

22:22.664 --> 22:24.102
It won't matter anyway.

22:24.324 --> 22:26.463
They'd never turn their backs on Kyle.

22:28.589 --> 22:29.622
We haven't.

22:30.876 --> 22:33.569
Unless they found out
that he's been lying to them.

22:34.539 --> 22:37.429
- They'll never forgive him.
- What is he supposed to do?

22:37.552 --> 22:39.974
Well, it was a nice setup
while it lasted, but...

22:40.748 --> 22:43.093
once he gets back,
he'll have to move on.

22:47.674 --> 22:48.724
Whatever.

22:57.911 --> 22:59.310
This can't lead anywhere,

22:59.485 --> 23:00.778
not anymore.

23:01.181 --> 23:03.447
We're here. We might
as well check it out.

23:03.567 --> 23:05.460
How far are we supposed to go?

23:06.051 --> 23:07.489
As far as we can.

23:11.669 --> 23:13.332
You really believe, don't you?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.338
I don't know if we'll find anything,

23:17.743 --> 23:18.899
but we might.

23:19.845 --> 23:21.382
I mean, there's a chance.

23:22.045 --> 23:23.262
There's hope.

23:35.397 --> 23:36.823
I make things happen.

23:38.545 --> 23:39.794
Strange things,

23:39.914 --> 23:42.529
when I'm angry or upset.

23:44.164 --> 23:45.332
Like what?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.971
I made lights explode.

23:51.253 --> 23:52.623
I shattered a skylight.

23:52.938 --> 23:54.000
You did?

23:54.378 --> 23:55.807
Not intentionally.

23:56.778 --> 23:58.217
How do we do that?

23:58.751 --> 24:02.225
It has to do with harnessing energy
and projecting it to the outside world.

24:03.065 --> 24:04.746
And they made us this way,

24:04.992 --> 24:06.627
the people who created us?

24:06.910 --> 24:09.750
Being in the pod gave our brains
more time to develop.

24:12.235 --> 24:13.392
Are we the only ones?

24:14.346 --> 24:15.569
As far as I know.

24:16.557 --> 24:18.522
I thought I was the only one
until you came along.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.352
Competition.

24:20.783 --> 24:22.318
I don't think of it that way.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.911
Maybe you should.

24:24.415 --> 24:26.604
Maybe I'm smarter...

24:27.526 --> 24:28.629
stronger...

24:29.587 --> 24:30.669
faster.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.414
The results of his MRI when
I first took him on as a patient

24:35.534 --> 24:37.911
showed an unprecedented
amount of brain activity,

24:38.034 --> 24:41.095
but the second MRI,
months later, was normal.

24:41.707 --> 24:43.259
He sleeps in a tub.

24:44.001 --> 24:45.161
Let's start with that.

24:45.348 --> 24:48.135
And I think we can scratch "normal"
off our Kyle adjective list.

24:48.255 --> 24:50.596
I'm less concerned about
his idiosyncrasies than I am

24:50.716 --> 24:53.349
about some of the more disturbing things
he's been involved with.

24:54.442 --> 24:57.478
He was found wandering near
Kearn's skeleton. Professor Kearn...

24:58.049 --> 25:01.398
taught at U-Dub, where he mentored
a student named Adam Baylin.

25:01.692 --> 25:02.942
Who looked just like Kyle.

25:03.165 --> 25:04.652
And kidnapped him, raising him

25:04.772 --> 25:07.071
for five years
until he committed suicide.

25:07.879 --> 25:10.658
And he comes to us with no memory
of any of this until his parents

25:10.778 --> 25:12.743
suddenly show up,
and he leaves with them.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.883
They're dead.

25:15.693 --> 25:17.281
Dad, you're creeping me out.

25:18.031 --> 25:19.375
Remember that basketball game

25:19.900 --> 25:22.211
where he scored all those
awesome half-court jumpers?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.342
Okay, a bunch of people died.

25:26.871 --> 25:29.109
But it's not like Kyle's responsible.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.319
But they're all connected to him.

25:33.322 --> 25:35.170
He didn't sleep for over a week.

25:35.633 --> 25:36.961
He jumped off our roof.

25:37.081 --> 25:39.061
He predicted lightning, an earthquake.

25:39.181 --> 25:40.755
There are pages of this.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.892
And don't forget, he drew a picture
of my father's living room perfectly

25:44.012 --> 25:45.815
even though he'd never been there.

25:46.025 --> 25:48.762
No one should be able to do
any of these things, and yet Kyle

25:48.882 --> 25:49.988
has done all of them.

25:50.759 --> 25:52.529
Because he's incredible.

25:53.654 --> 25:54.785
He's amazing.

25:55.529 --> 25:58.789
You're acting like he's done something
wrong, like he's some sort of freak.

25:58.909 --> 26:01.041
We're just trying to make
sense of what's happened.

26:01.246 --> 26:03.127
Don't put him on trial
before he gets home.

26:04.043 --> 26:05.587
Give him a chance to explain.

26:06.170 --> 26:08.716
That's what you do for me and Lori
when you think we screwed up.

26:09.010 --> 26:12.355
Seriously, Josh, when you hear
all this stuff together, it sounds so

26:12.625 --> 26:14.113
wild and weird.

26:14.236 --> 26:16.807
When you think about it, what
do we really know about Kyle?

26:17.058 --> 26:18.976
I know. Who is he?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.857
What are you talking about?

26:21.952 --> 26:22.980
He's our brother.

26:27.165 --> 26:28.318
He's your son.

26:31.942 --> 26:32.969
Anyhow,

26:33.485 --> 26:35.133
I'm not doing this anymore.

26:53.035 --> 26:55.027
Who'd live all the way out here?

26:57.461 --> 26:59.784
I think it may be somebody
who's expecting us.

27:18.485 --> 27:21.080
- You can't walk into someone's house.
- I can.

27:29.748 --> 27:30.748
Hello?

27:32.875 --> 27:34.187
Is anyone here?

27:43.521 --> 27:45.328
Are we in the right place?

27:45.844 --> 27:46.963
I think so.

27:59.247 --> 28:00.612
I know this book.

28:11.911 --> 28:13.227
It's in Hungarian.

28:22.854 --> 28:23.899
Dad.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.669
Yeah.

28:28.163 --> 28:29.822
I know you didn't do anything.

28:31.974 --> 28:33.437
I know you love Mom.

28:33.622 --> 28:35.687
I should have never doubted you.

28:36.441 --> 28:37.906
I'm so sorry.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.188
Sweetie.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.997
Thank you for apologizing.

28:46.751 --> 28:49.601
I don't know how much longer
we should wait to go after him.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.117
We don't know where he is.

28:56.253 --> 28:58.244
- Why don't you try his cell?
- I just did.

28:58.367 --> 28:59.720
He's still not picking up.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.792
I know he was talking to Declan earlier,

29:01.912 --> 29:03.640
but he wouldn't tell me anything.

29:03.789 --> 29:05.817
You think Declan has something to tell?

29:06.641 --> 29:09.714
He was Mood Swing Central when
Kyle left with the Petersons, and...

29:09.837 --> 29:11.773
he only got worse when Kyle came back.

29:14.096 --> 29:15.444
This spot in the woods.

29:15.590 --> 29:17.988
Declan went with Kyle,
and they followed these coordinates.

29:18.108 --> 29:20.240
The numbers Kyle kept
repeating under hypnosis.

29:23.783 --> 29:25.651
That place in the woods.

29:26.548 --> 29:27.706
It could be the same.

29:28.785 --> 29:30.077
Same as what?

29:33.608 --> 29:34.796
We didn't tell you guys,

29:36.158 --> 29:39.464
but we went to the woods
about a month ago near Victor Falls,

29:40.349 --> 29:43.305
and there were these freaky
underground tunnels we got stuck in.

29:43.425 --> 29:44.692
Tunnels?

29:45.061 --> 29:46.600
Like a bomb shelter.

29:46.807 --> 29:48.602
Kyle said there was
nothing there but trees.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.216
Oh, believe me, there's something there,

29:51.336 --> 29:54.529
and Kyle really did not
want us to go... Kyle and Declan.

29:57.750 --> 30:00.172
Doesn't seem like anyone
stayed here in a while.

30:04.098 --> 30:05.336
Is that a closet?

30:12.283 --> 30:13.488
We didn't check.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.996
I think we just found what we came for.

30:55.007 --> 30:56.335
How do we get in?

31:06.712 --> 31:08.741
There are a million
possible combinations.

31:10.164 --> 31:11.470
It's like a song.

31:14.602 --> 31:15.835
The song.

31:17.003 --> 31:18.073
D4.

31:18.859 --> 31:20.236
The song in the juke box?

31:20.384 --> 31:21.945
And from the back of the picture.

31:22.154 --> 31:23.298
That has to be it.

31:24.824 --> 31:27.332
Well, even if it is,
we don't know how to play it.

31:28.918 --> 31:30.454
I know someone who will.

31:30.664 --> 31:32.748
<i>- Where are you?
- It's hard to explain.</i>

31:33.454 --> 31:34.458
I need your help.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.126
Sure. What's up?

31:36.290 --> 31:38.211
Do you know a song
called She Could Be You?

31:38.802 --> 31:40.255
No. Never heard of it.

31:40.474 --> 31:42.799
Do you think you could look it up
and play the melody?

31:42.969 --> 31:44.176
Kyle, what's this about?

31:45.051 --> 31:47.928
I'm trying to figure something out.
That song could be the key.

31:48.063 --> 31:49.389
Tell her it's important.

31:49.650 --> 31:50.766
Are you with Jessi?

31:54.702 --> 31:55.729
Yes.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.148
You call me for help,
and you're out somewhere with her?

31:58.416 --> 32:01.151
- Amanda, I...
- That's completely inappropriate.

32:01.473 --> 32:03.070
I wish I could tell you why.

32:04.412 --> 32:05.506
Give it a shot.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.526
<i>All I can say is I'll never
do anything to betray you.</i>

32:10.732 --> 32:13.789
<i>You know I wouldn't ask you for this
if it wasn't something I really needed.</i>

32:15.883 --> 32:18.168
You know how much I care about you.

32:23.548 --> 32:24.549
Give me a few minutes.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.555
Got your message.

32:31.023 --> 32:32.541
What's going on?

32:32.966 --> 32:35.479
We need you to tell us
about that place in the woods.

32:36.857 --> 32:38.099
What place?

32:39.205 --> 32:41.024
I've already told them about that night.

32:41.357 --> 32:43.201
We're not fooling around here.

32:43.496 --> 32:46.890
Mr. Trager, I wish I could help,
but I don't know anything about it.

32:47.025 --> 32:49.270
We're concerned about Kyle, Declan,

32:49.430 --> 32:52.869
and you seem to be involved in a lot of
things we try to understand about him.

32:57.212 --> 32:59.418
Like I said, I wish I could help.

33:00.166 --> 33:01.519
- That's it.
- What are you doing?

33:01.642 --> 33:03.689
Something I should have done.
Calling the cops.

33:03.818 --> 33:04.950
Wait. Don't do that.

33:05.122 --> 33:06.591
Why shouldn't he?

33:08.867 --> 33:10.011
Don't call the police.

33:12.593 --> 33:13.890
Not if you care about Kyle.

33:14.068 --> 33:16.268
- Get the hell out of my house.
- Mr. Trager, it's okay.

33:17.634 --> 33:20.397
He's looked out for Kyle
from the beginning.

33:22.380 --> 33:23.474
He's a friend.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.129
You know what's going on.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.155
You lied. You've been lying.

33:28.429 --> 33:30.574
- I've been trying to protect Kyle.
- From what?

33:32.025 --> 33:34.161
I don't want to hear
your crap anymore. Get out.

33:35.652 --> 33:36.830
Get out!

33:38.984 --> 33:40.029
Please,

33:40.816 --> 33:41.997
listen to him.

33:52.042 --> 33:53.050
Okay.

33:53.468 --> 33:55.030
I found the music online.

33:55.654 --> 33:57.309
- You ready?
- I'm listening.

34:31.782 --> 34:32.969
Is that what you needed?

34:34.696 --> 34:35.983
That's perfect.

34:37.496 --> 34:38.516
Thank you, Amanda.

34:41.257 --> 34:42.389
You're welcome.

34:45.327 --> 34:46.777
I'm leaving tomorrow.

34:48.143 --> 34:49.694
Will you be back to say good-bye?

34:51.906 --> 34:53.025
I wanna be.

35:06.573 --> 35:07.587
She played it?

35:08.881 --> 35:09.881
Yes.

35:32.151 --> 35:33.196
You were right.

35:34.413 --> 35:35.606
Wait.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.064
No matter what we find,

35:40.184 --> 35:42.577
you've done a lot for me,
and I wanna thank you.

35:43.437 --> 35:44.630
You don't need to.

35:45.134 --> 35:46.634
You've made me feel safe,

35:47.655 --> 35:49.296
and you've given me hope.

36:25.339 --> 36:26.556
Who is he?

36:27.528 --> 36:28.585
Adam Baylin.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.599
I thought you said Adam Baylin was dead.

36:43.585 --> 36:45.183
I scattered his ashes.

36:46.733 --> 36:48.245
I guess they weren't his.

36:50.938 --> 36:53.026
Why would they make me believe that...

36:55.512 --> 36:57.697
<i>I'm sure that you have questions,</i>

36:59.165 --> 37:00.555
but Kyle should answer them.

37:00.675 --> 37:02.597
No. You tell me now.

37:03.298 --> 37:06.556
Last time I saw you, Brian Taylor
had you locked up in a room at Madacorp.

37:07.282 --> 37:08.302
Why?

37:09.187 --> 37:11.679
- We had a disagreement.
- What kind of answer is that?

37:11.800 --> 37:13.984
All I can tell you
is Kyle's done nothing wrong.

37:14.104 --> 37:16.091
You were our security guard,

37:16.805 --> 37:19.719
but Declan said you looked out for Kyle.
What did he mean?

37:22.353 --> 37:23.530
That means...

37:26.038 --> 37:27.894
I've known him since he was a child.

37:33.255 --> 37:34.780
He's been through a lot.

37:36.883 --> 37:38.822
And he's very special,
but you already know that.

37:40.387 --> 37:42.564
- Do you know where he is?
- I think so.

37:42.687 --> 37:45.412
He's asked me to stay around
to look after your family.

37:47.678 --> 37:48.907
All he's...

37:49.325 --> 37:51.751
ever wanted...

37:52.145 --> 37:54.254
was to be a part of your family.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.589
To Kyle, this is home.

38:03.751 --> 38:05.866
Well, I can take care of my family.

38:07.796 --> 38:09.407
It's time for you to go.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.606
And bring our son home.

38:27.321 --> 38:28.913
He knows I'm here.

38:36.088 --> 38:38.882
I think we can communicate with him.
I've done it before.

38:39.629 --> 38:42.760
We can pick up the electrical impulses
in his brain, just like the monitor.

38:44.301 --> 38:45.339
No.

38:46.318 --> 38:47.621
I don't want to.

38:48.672 --> 38:49.672
Okay.

38:51.112 --> 38:52.305
I'll try.

39:02.733 --> 39:04.157
I really don't wanna talk.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.719
Then just listen.

39:10.909 --> 39:12.499
I know it's been a strange day.

39:13.048 --> 39:14.831
It's been a strange year.

39:15.531 --> 39:18.505
And remembering all the things that
have happened since Kyle's been with us,

39:18.985 --> 39:21.174
and knowing he's connected
to Jessi in some way

39:21.294 --> 39:22.509
and the...

39:23.036 --> 39:24.758
trouble that's caused us...

39:27.330 --> 39:30.517
I just want to tell all of you
that I'm sorry.

39:30.772 --> 39:32.641
You're sorry? What for?

39:32.764 --> 39:34.771
I'm the one that brought
them both into this house.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.182
That's not your fault.

39:37.141 --> 39:39.619
I was just so taken with Kyle, and I...

39:39.754 --> 39:41.569
I accepted things
that didn't make sense,

39:43.086 --> 39:44.242
and I allowed

39:44.427 --> 39:46.199
wanting to protect him
to come between us.

39:48.275 --> 39:50.370
I am so sorry, Stephen.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.500
It's okay.

39:57.597 --> 39:59.245
We can get through anything,

39:59.666 --> 40:00.720
remember?

40:08.553 --> 40:11.266
This isn't one of those
group hug moments, is it?

40:12.930 --> 40:14.644
- Josh, you were right before.
- I was?

40:14.893 --> 40:17.217
When we said we didn't know
who Kyle really is.

40:18.447 --> 40:21.225
We know who he is.
He's part of our family.

40:22.041 --> 40:23.935
When he comes back, he'll explain.

40:24.734 --> 40:27.328
So does that mean you're not
going to call the cops?

40:27.894 --> 40:29.701
Hopefully, I won't have a reason to.

40:30.193 --> 40:31.902
So what do we do now?

40:33.021 --> 40:34.976
We wait for Kyle to come home.

40:47.074 --> 40:48.795
Is he communicating with you?

40:53.738 --> 40:55.768
I think he's trying,
but I'm not getting anything.

40:59.117 --> 41:00.523
Will you help me?

41:04.116 --> 41:05.320
I don't know how.

41:06.538 --> 41:08.156
Don't be afraid.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.589
Open your mind.

41:26.228 --> 41:27.091
And focus.

41:40.306 --> 41:42.940
<i>I need to know why
our journey had led us here.</i>

41:43.330 --> 41:45.526
<i>Hoping Adam would guide us forward,</i>

41:45.801 --> 41:47.536
<i>I cleared my mind and opened my heart,</i>

41:47.659 --> 41:49.048
<i>trying to connect with him,</i>

41:49.579 --> 41:51.407
<i>strengthening the pathway
with Jessi's help.</i>

41:52.779 --> 41:56.449
<i>While focused on Adam, I felt
all the barriers between us slip away,</i>

41:56.843 --> 41:58.908
<i>then a powerful exchange of energy</i>

41:59.056 --> 42:01.501
<i>as Jessi reached into my mind
and connected with me.</i>

42:05.625 --> 42:07.590
<i>Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.</i>

42:18.055 --> 42:19.395
Jessi, wait!

42:46.525 --> 42:47.866
Why are you running?

42:48.812 --> 42:50.967
I did it. I got into your head.

42:51.184 --> 42:55.054
When you tried to connect with Baylin,
I took what they wanted me to.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.754
The information.

42:57.910 --> 42:59.350
Why did you take it?

42:59.582 --> 43:00.893
I couldn't help myself.

43:03.049 --> 43:04.564
You shouldn't have trusted me.

43:07.270 --> 43:08.443
No!
