04:35.067 --> 04:37.443
I live in a little town
about an hour north of here called Marlton.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.070
I live in Denver.
I came in last night.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.529
You see all those thunderstorms last night?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.740
I didn't think I was gonna get in.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.408
You know, I picked this up...

04:49.915 --> 04:51.707
No, I haven't done it yet.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.293
I'm still working on them,
trying to get certain days off.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.463
And it looks like the only way I can get it
is to bid the reserve.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.465
Yeah, you know,
I go back to the Training Center.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.510
I have a month on, month off,

No, that's fine. Okay.

She's got a crush on that maintenance man.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.807
- See you later, guys.
- Oops. Oh, sorry.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.601
I keep taking that. Damn.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.020
As I go over here and build my nest,

05:54.104 --> 05:55.771
you want to go outside
and do the walkaround?

05:55.856 --> 05:56.939
Yeah.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.067
I'll be with you in about five minutes.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.278

- All righty.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.384
Okay, I'll call her now.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.149
Well, is it a complicated graphic?

06:40.484 --> 06:42.985
- 'Cause if it's really...
- Excuse me.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.036
Take care. Okay, bye.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.997
...and I'll call you right back.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.582
And, Kevin...

07:02.506 --> 07:05.049
Drive south. We'll be there in time.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.095
Did you get the word
about putting on some extra fuel?

07:09.179 --> 07:11.931
- Yeah. Yeah, doing it now.
- Okay, thanks.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.029
- Good morning.
- Congratulations on the promotion, Ben.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.114

Good morning.
I'm happy to see you all awake.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.788
John. How are you this morning, sir?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.456
Mr. Sliney, good morning to you.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.791
- You know the fellows.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.586
Good morning. How are you?
How was that midshift?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.712
- Rough.
- Yeah.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.965
The floor is yours.
Hold on, and I'll see you at the 8:30.

Thanks, John. I'll catch up with you.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.551

07:48.635 --> 07:49.885
- Ready for a brief?
- Yes, sir.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.264
All right, sir,
we've got a small system in the southwest.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.724
Nothing too big.
Shouldn't be a big problem.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.018
Some low ceilings over San Francisco,
nothing major.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.396
That system finally moved off to the east.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.981
And we've got clear skies.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.649
Good. It'll be a good day
on the East Coast.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.318
Yeah, what time is that fog supposed
to lift in the west? Do you know?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.862
We're looking early afternoon.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.155
Excellent. Excellent.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.950
The President moving out
of Sarasota today up to Andrews.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.161
Got restrictions in place till 10:30.

08:15.245 --> 08:19.623
Standard ops in the morning,
normal morning restrictions in New York.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.169
Yeah, he always wants to fly right
when traffic's the heaviest.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.254
Thanks. See you, fellows.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.052
New York cranking up?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.345
Yes, sir.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.514
All right. Good.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.058
What is that?
Coordinators down there?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.227
That's right. It needs to be diverted south.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.104
- Dallas/Fort Worth, go ahead.
- Yeah.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.964
Can you guys hear me back there?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.926
Do you guys have sugars up there?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.302
Okay. Thanks.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.678
Steal us a newspaper, that'd be great.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.263
What'd she say the movie was?
<i>Knight's Tale?</i>

09:16.348 --> 09:17.348
<i>Knight's Tale.</i>

09:17.432 --> 09:19.725
Yeah, for cockpit access knock,
let's use three and one.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.518
- Three and one?
- Yeah.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.603
- Got you.
- Yup. That'll get you in.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.439
Shipley and Mark do that.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.233
I just didn't want to.
It wasn't the right time.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.317
Yeah, it's Jeremy.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.860
Hey, two things.

09:29.945 --> 09:34.114
First, speaking of Shipley,
that e-mail that he sent,

09:34.199 --> 09:37.534
when you respond to it,
CC me a copy of the response.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.079
- Isn't that sweet?
- Yeah, we're getting a, you know...

09:40.163 --> 09:42.581
- No, don't send it to Kevin.
- I'm so sorry...

09:42.666 --> 09:46.418
No, it'd just go to waste on Joe.
He'd be just as happy with Ripple.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.046
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

And, sir, can I get you something to drink
while you're waiting for take-off?

10:25.375 --> 10:28.294
Coffee would be great
with cream and no sugar.

<i>and together, the two of us

<i>En route time today

13:43.907 --> 13:46.867
<i>That'll put us on the gate in San Francisco

13:49.329 --> 13:50.454
It's a beautiful day for flying,

13:50.538 --> 13:53.457
and our forecast across the country

14:39.045 --> 14:41.797
This is Rich Sullivan with the 11:15
strategic planning telcon.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.966
We're updating advisory number 23.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.761
First issue, we're showing
15-minute departure delays out of Newark.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.845
Give us an update there.

14:48.930 --> 14:49.972
I just spoke to Pete.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.057
They're gonna try and get
those reduced or eliminated.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.934
They're gonna get Washington
to reduce their restrictions,

14:54.018 --> 14:56.019
so probably it'll clear up
in about a half hour or so.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.648
Okay, we're gonna lessen the restrictions
or eliminate them on the Newark departures.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.526
And the departure delays
should be coming down here very soon.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.738
Next, we got a large-scale military exercise
off the East Coast today.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.741
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed at 1400.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.120
All the traffic will have to be moved inland.
Any questions on that?

15:13.204 --> 15:16.915
<i>This is JetBlue.
Is Amber 761 available for offloads today?</i>

15:17.375 --> 15:18.542
Don't go for it.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.252
No exceptions.
They're gonna have to wait.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.336
No exceptions.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.921
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed.

Everyone's gonna be moved inland.
And that's it.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.676
Anybody have anything else
for the morning plan?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.678
Okay, we'll do the next telcon at 1315.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.762

Good day.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.353
Glens Falls. After Glens Falls...

15:38.438 --> 15:41.565
And American 11, climb,
maintain flight level 350.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.191
Air Canada 129, Boston Center.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.818

How do you hear? Boston Center.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.792
- Hey, Greg?
- Yeah?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.878
Try American 11 again.
See if he's on your frequency,

16:02.962 --> 16:05.005
- if he came back to you.
- American 11, Boston Center.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.506
How do you read?

16:07.592 --> 16:11.053
American flight 11, Boston Center.
Do you read?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.395
<i>There are also two window exits
located over the wings.</i>

16:20.563 --> 16:23.148
<i>Each exit is marked
with a sign overhead.</i>

16:23.232 --> 16:26.735
<i>Look around to locate
the two exits nearest to your seat.</i>

16:26.819 --> 16:30.572
<i>In some cases,
the nearest exit may be behind you.</i>

16:30.657 --> 16:34.201
<i>In an evacuation, exit path lights
will automatically illuminate</i>

16:34.285 --> 16:36.244
<i>to guide you to an exit.</i>

16:36.537 --> 16:39.414
<i>A life vest is located
under your seat.</i>

16:40.083 --> 16:42.542
<i>It can be identified by a red tab.</i>

16:42.710 --> 16:45.921
<i>Do not remove it
unless directed by a flight attendant.</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:47.506
- Taxi clearance.
- Stand by.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.633
<i>We've got your release.
I want you to move up in the line</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:52.094
<i>behind the United 757.</i>

16:52.970 --> 16:57.140
<i>Good morning, ground.
United 93, Gate 17, ready to taxi.</i>

16:57.225 --> 16:58.308
<i>We have Alpha.</i>

16:58.393 --> 17:03.355
United 93, taxi runway four-left
via Bravo Romeo Bravo.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.856
Hold short of Victor.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.317
<i>Roger. Said four-left
Bravo Romeo Bravo.</i>

17:07.402 --> 17:09.611
<i>Hold short Victor. United 93.</i>

17:13.574 --> 17:15.742
And American 11 on emergency frequency,

17:15.827 --> 17:19.746
if you hear Boston,
come up on frequency 127.82.

17:24.042 --> 17:28.255
Am-X 7281, contact Boston on 133.42.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.216
Athens, Boston.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.552
Do me a favor,
you got that United 175 out there.

17:33.636 --> 17:37.013
Can you have them take a look and see
if you can get a visual on American 11?

17:37.098 --> 17:38.306
767.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.686
United 175, turn 20 degrees to your left,
vector for traffic.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.398
In your turn, look for traffic
12 o'clock to 1 o'clock, about 15 miles.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.401
He's tracking south-southwestbound.
Altitude's unknown.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.028
It's an American 767.
Let me know if you get a visual on him.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.405
Am-X 7281,

17:53.489 --> 17:56.283
proceed direct O'Neill,
resume all navigation.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.079
US Air 312, contact Boston on 133.42.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.708
November 3622. Tango, roger.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.003
<i>Just be quiet and you'll be okay.
We are returning to the airport.</i>

18:08.087 --> 18:10.881
Call in Boston Center.
Say again, please.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.510
Hey, John! Come here!

18:18.181 --> 18:19.723
What's going on?

18:19.807 --> 18:22.726
Aircraft, call in Boston.
Say again, please.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
This guy here just contacted me.
I heard some verbiage

18:25.396 --> 18:29.191
over the background.
It was not American, it was foreign.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.735
They said something about
taking over the cockpit,

18:31.819 --> 18:33.695
"Stay calm, we're going back
to the airport."

18:33.780 --> 18:36.656
I have no idea who it was.
I think we have a hijack situation here.

18:36.741 --> 18:37.824
What makes you think that's a hijacker?

18:37.909 --> 18:38.950
Just trust me.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.660
I heard the guy in my ear, okay?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.037
- I heard the guy in my ear.
- All right.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.955
You need to check it out.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.832
Command Center East. Tony.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.043
Hey, Ben, we're doing a coffee run.
You want some coffee?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.586
No, I'm filled up with coffee.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.797
How are they doing on those restrictions
out of New York, Al?

18:51.881 --> 18:55.258
Tell them they got them reduced.
So La Guardia, in fact, is now out of delays.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.551
Newark's gonna stay a while, though.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.303
Good job. Good job. Excellent.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.721
Excellent.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.057
Rich, you need to monitor this.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.522
Yeah, let me take this stuff.
I got to get to the 8:30, so...

19:08.606 --> 19:10.232
Command Center East. Toby.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.691
Hey, Walsh.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.531
Hey, Ben! Ben, hang on.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.698
Yes?

19:19.575 --> 19:22.452
Listen, we're just getting
a preliminary report from Boston Center.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.912
They think they've got a hijacking.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.080
A hijacking?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.958
It's American 11. A heavy 767.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.042
Departed Boston for LA.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.210
Where is he now?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.962
He's about 50, 60 west of Boston.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.338
You got a squawk 7500?

19:33.422 --> 19:34.464
No, I don't think so.

19:34.549 --> 19:35.966
They heard some kind
of suspicious transmission,

19:36.092 --> 19:37.217
- so they're checking on it...
- All right.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.343
- It's very preliminary.
- All right.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.763
When you get some hard information,
let me know and I'll brief the staff.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.014
Thanks.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.099
Did someone say "hijack"?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.477
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.728
- Good.
- Before we get started...

19:48.855 --> 19:51.481
- Well, that was a possible hijack. American...
- What?

19:51.566 --> 19:52.524
- Yeah.
- Hijack?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.942
- Anybody remember...
- Haven't seen that in years.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.527
- Yeah, I know.
- When was the last time we had a hijack?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.654
- It's been quite a while, quite a while.
- '91, '90.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.198
- I can't even remember precisely.
- Yeah, I know.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.993
No, no.
It's Boston to LAX, American 11.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.995
Yeah, they're on it
and they're gonna keep me informed.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.705
- I'll brief you.
- Okay.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.875
<i>Hey, ground. United 93.
What's our sequence?</i>

20:09.959 --> 20:12.836
United 93, follow the Continental and Delta.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.589
You're number 15 for the departure.
Monitor tower.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.726
<i>Air Canada 273, turn left...</i>

20:27.810 --> 20:29.811
Well, folks, from the flight deck,
Captain Dahl.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.063
Looks like we've run into a little bit
of rush hour traffic

20:32.148 --> 20:34.566
<i>here at Newark this morning,
and that's a typical day at Newark.</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:36.818
<i>I count 15 airplanes
ahead of us for departure,</i>

20:36.903 --> 20:38.945
<i>and they're getting them off
about one every two minutes,</i>

20:39.030 --> 20:41.239
<i>so unfortunately it's gonna be
about a 30-minute delay</i>

20:41.324 --> 20:42.490
<i>until we get airborne.</i>

20:42.575 --> 20:44.993
I apologize for the delay
and I appreciate your patience,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.203
and I'll get back to you
with an update. Thank you.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.246
Yes?

20:48.331 --> 20:49.414
Is everything okay?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.959
Yeah, it's just fine.
Just a normal delay out of Newark.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.587
Excuse me, can I have a pillow
and a blanket, please?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.384
What did you say?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.265
Guys, just keep your planes
away from him, man.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.850
I have no idea what this guy's doing.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.935
What do we have, Pete?

21:10.019 --> 21:12.270
I gave all my aircraft
over to Greg already.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.813
He's working them.
I'm holding onto this.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.523
This guy right here
is the only guy I have.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.859
He's westbound right now.
I heard some voices in my ears.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.819
- Flight 11, American Airlines?
- But no 7500 code?

21:19.904 --> 21:22.238
No, I had no 7500 code. Nothing.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.786
American 11, Boston Center.
American 11, how do you hear?

21:27.870 --> 21:30.038
No, see, that doesn't make sense.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.001
What's up, Pete?
Where are we at?

21:35.086 --> 21:36.378
I just put it up into the speaker here,

21:36.462 --> 21:39.214
if we hear anything back,
but right now we just have the guy.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.383
He's due westbound. He's climbing...

21:41.467 --> 21:43.343
- <i>I'm going back to the airport.</i>
- That's it.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.511
That's it right here.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.805
Somebody's got to pull
these fucking tapes right now.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.848
Pull the tapes now from 0800 on.

21:50.559 --> 21:54.604
<i>To all personnel, NORAD exercise
commencing in five minutes.</i>

22:00.444 --> 22:01.695
Huntress. Weapons. Sergeant Powell.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.164
Okay, and remember this is a NORAD exercise.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.459
Right now we have Russian Bears
penetrating the ADIZ up off Alaska,

22:16.544 --> 22:19.004
so you'll want your tracker techs
keeping their eyes open.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.881
Okay, stand by, one second.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.516
Dawne, go out and see
what Powell's so excited about.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.892
Yes, sir.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.480
Powell, what do you got?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.816
Hey, I got a hijack on the phone. Boston.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.900
Is this a sim?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.694
- No, real world.
- Come on, where's EET?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.362
No, it's a no-shit hijack. It's Boston.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.405
Serious?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.115
- Yes.
- All right.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.621
Okay, thanks.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.712
Well, okay, give them a call.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.088
Yeah, we have a possible hijack.

23:02.173 --> 23:04.966
General update.
Tell them we're ready here. Okay?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.092
Can do, sir.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.552
- Sir?
- Yeah.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.888
We have a real world situation here.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.432
We have American Airlines flight 11.

23:12.516 --> 23:16.227
It's a 757 out of Boston to LAX.

23:16.771 --> 23:20.398
Ninety-two passengers on it,
and it's at 7500.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.858
- Still squawking?
- No, sir.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.568
Okay. Get Nasypany to the floor!

23:23.652 --> 23:25.820
All operational personnel to the floor!

23:25.905 --> 23:29.240
<i>Major Nasypany,
report to the operations floor immediately.</i>

23:29.325 --> 23:32.077
<i>All operations personnel
report to the ops room...</i>

23:32.161 --> 23:35.330
This is Colonel Marr here.
Get me General Arnold.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.046
Here you go.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.362
Folks, Captain Dahl again with an update.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.947
We're making some progress now.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.698
<i>We're about number four for departure.</i>

24:10.783 --> 24:13.326
<i>I'll get with you when we're number one.
Thanks for your patience.</i>

24:13.410 --> 24:15.954
We just want to take your order
for breakfast after take-off.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.622
You're gonna get it.
We have a hot breakfast,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.541
which is, like, an omelet, roll and fruit.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.000
I'll take that. Thanks very much.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.544
Okay, great.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.381
I'm sorry for the delay.
We'll be out of here as soon as we can.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.715
I understand. Thank you.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.802
Would you mind bringing me
some water with my breakfast?

24:30.886 --> 24:32.220
I have to take some pills.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.888
Sure. No worries.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.142
I'd just as soon stay out
of the more populated areas.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.309
Well, here are the falls.

24:38.394 --> 24:42.063
If we go up there, we'll be all right.
I'd like to get up in that high country.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.824
Go ahead, sir.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.325
<i>Good morning, Major.</i>

24:54.410 --> 24:58.872
We got a possible hijack in progress
out of Boston.

24:59.582 --> 25:04.085
<i>American Airlines 757. They're not squawking.
Let's find them.</i>

25:04.211 --> 25:05.587
Copy that.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.799
All right, let's go.
Listen up, everybody!

25:09.884 --> 25:12.760
All right, look, we got a possible hijack.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.306
This is real world. Possible hijack.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.892
Surveillance, get your tracking techs on scopes.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.643
- I want two on a scope.
- Copy that.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.478
I wanna know if he pops up again.

25:22.563 --> 25:26.941
ID, get on the phones with the FAA.
Let's get his last known position.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.818
- Copy.
- Weapons.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.529
- Otis to battle stations.
- Copy that.

25:31.614 --> 25:34.115
- Do you have a call sign or anything?
- Battle stations. Copy.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.325
American Airlines 11.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.827
American Airlines 11 is the call sign.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.787
Sir, it's confirmed.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.541
And now the aircraft is NORDO.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.626
We get a lot of that crap.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.337
Somebody's making
phony transmissions on the radio...

25:47.421 --> 25:51.257
If it's not confirmed,
it's probably a lost radio call or something.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.010
Command Center. Tony.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.554
Stand by one second.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.932
Yesterday, we had two ground delay programs.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.851
One at Atlanta and one at O'Hare.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.771
And we had 850 aircraft delayed.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.106
Hit a 56-minute average

26:07.191 --> 26:11.694
and a very modest 47,600 delay minutes.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.781
Benny, that is like,
$2,000 a minute we are talking about.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.449
You are into a hole already for...

26:16.533 --> 26:18.785
- No, no, no.
- 90 million bucks, Ben.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.537
They're not even my delays.
I started today.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.830
Ben, we need you on the floor.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.582
We're getting more information
on that American 11.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.918
- Oh, all right. Listen, excuse me, John...
- Yeah.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.586
and, folks, I'm gonna go out
and take care of this.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.088
- We're getting some more updates
- Okay.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.257
And I'll brief you as soon
as I get some more information.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.716
What do you got?

26:33.801 --> 26:35.510
American Airlines contacted Boston Center.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.263
Apparently, a flight attendant
onboard the aircraft

26:38.347 --> 26:41.849
via telephone called the company
and she said that

26:41.934 --> 26:45.687
the aircraft is being hijacked
and one or more people have been stabbed.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.896
Stabbed on the plane?

26:46.981 --> 26:48.189
Yeah. Just confirm...

26:48.274 --> 26:51.359
American Airlines gave this information
to Boston who called us.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.736
- Is the aircraft still on course?
- The last I heard.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.446
- Let's get an update from Tony.
- All right.

26:55.531 --> 26:56.489
All right, stand by.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.615
- This is Boston on the line right now.
- Yeah.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.950
They don't know anything more.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.245
There was a suspicious transmission,
the controller heard it,

27:02.329 --> 27:05.456
and they're pulling tapes to see exactly
what was said on the frequency.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.417
And American Airlines
is the one that called them.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.627
- Who is it?
- The ops manager of Boston Center.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.920
Hi, this is Ben Sliney.

27:11.005 --> 27:13.131
Boston thought it may have been a...
They heard

27:13.215 --> 27:15.216
- Yes.
- some kind of oddball transmission.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.509
- Right.
- So she called the company,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.469
she said their airplane
was being hijacked...

27:18.554 --> 27:19.929
All right. Has he changed altitude?

27:20.014 --> 27:22.515
don't know if it's a person or people
who've been stabbed.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.933
All right.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.979
All right, we're pulling it up now,
and, listen,

27:28.063 --> 27:32.191
if you get any further information
on the track or the altitude, let me know.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.571
All right. Keep me advised.
Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.947
All right, look, the...

27:38.032 --> 27:40.867
That aircraft has made a turn southbound

27:40.951 --> 27:42.994
and they're not tracking him any longer.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.788
They're not getting any Mode C
altitude information.

27:45.873 --> 27:49.709
And I see our track has gone ghost on it,
but they do say he's heading southbound.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.503
I want us to get in touch
with New York Center

27:52.588 --> 27:55.256
and let them know he's coming.
Let's get everything out of its way

27:55.341 --> 27:56.841
and even give New York TRACON a call

27:56.925 --> 27:59.427
because he may be trying to head
for one of the New York airports.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.595
Okay, right.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.138
Information's that American 11...

28:02.222 --> 28:03.848
Maybe we should get in touch
with headquarters

28:03.974 --> 28:05.975
- and start briefing them on this now.
- Yeah, I'll call immediately.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.101
Thanks.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.568
Folks, Captain Dahl with some good news.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.070
We're currently number one for departure.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.529
<i>We'll be airborne shortly.</i>

28:18.614 --> 28:21.699
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare for take-off, please.</i>

28:22.451 --> 28:25.286
You know, I try and drop
as many trips as I can.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.581
- I like to be home with my babies.
- Yeah.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.749
Yeah.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.251
Did you bring some good magazines
to keep yourself awake?

28:33.462 --> 28:37.006
I don't think I've gotten through a magazine in
I can't tell you how long.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.306
<i>We have some planes.
Just stay quiet and you'll be okay.</i>

28:45.391 --> 28:47.683
<i>We are returning to the airport.</i>

28:52.356 --> 28:55.733
<i>We have some planes.
Just stay quiet and you'll be okay.</i>

28:55.818 --> 28:57.819
<i>We are returning to the airport.</i>

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
<i>Planes.</i>

29:13.669 --> 29:16.087
<i>We have some planes.</i>

29:22.803 --> 29:26.722
Yeah, it's Bob here.
It's "planes." Planes. Plural.

29:26.807 --> 29:27.974
Definitely, yeah.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.443
United 93, wind 050 at 6.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.154
Runway four-left. Clear for take-off.

29:41.738 --> 29:45.450
010 up to 5,000. Clear for take off.
Four-left. United 93.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.035
010, 5,000. Here we go.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.697
Welcome to New York Center.
Altimeter is 2996.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.366
Maintain speed 310...

31:08.450 --> 31:09.659
speed of 300 knots or greater.

31:10.202 --> 31:14.872
Maintain flight level 220
and maintain a speed of 300 knots.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.875
Roger, you got it.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.505
New York. Thumbser.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.299
Yeah, Boston.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.306
New York. United 175.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.483
All right, thank you.
I got it. All right.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.029
- Hey, Dave?
- Yeah?

31:47.114 --> 31:48.864
American 11 looking
as a possible hijacking.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.408
- It may be going back into Kennedy.
- Hijack?

31:50.492 --> 31:51.534
They say they heard something,

31:51.618 --> 31:53.160
that there might be intrusion
into the cockpit.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.412
All right, just let me know
if you hear anything,

31:54.496 --> 31:55.746
- anything unusual or anything.
- I'll watch him.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.248
He's not squawking 7500.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.749
- So just keep it normal.
- No, he's not doing anything.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.875
I'll keep an eye on him. I got it.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.752
- Just keep an eye on him.
- Will do.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.256
- What's going on?
- We got a hijack.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.633
It might be a hijack, I don't know.
It's American 11.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.010
- It's going down.
- You got a hijack?

32:09.052 --> 32:10.636
- We haven't had a hijack in 20 years.
- I don't know.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.346
Listen, I don't know.
What do you want me to tell you?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.890
I just gotta watch him.
That's all.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.351
- Chris, you got that?
- Thumbser.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.396
United 175 heavy,
New York, go ahead.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.984
...west of Kennedy by 15 southbound descending,
it's American 11.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.445
We're not sure what the problem is yet.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.488
Possible hijacking, we're not sure.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.284
Passenger said something
about they're up front.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.786
Roger, United 175 heavy.
Well, I'll pass it along.

32:35.871 --> 32:36.912
- Wait, I'll talk to him.
- Paul!

32:36.997 --> 32:37.955
- Hold on.
- Paul,

32:38.040 --> 32:39.290
United 175 heavy just called.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.500
He said he heard
a suspicious transmission on the radio

32:41.585 --> 32:42.835
as he was climbing out of Logan.

32:42.919 --> 32:46.464
He said something about,
"Everybody stay in your seats."

32:46.548 --> 32:48.507
He doesn't know who it came from,
but it came out

32:48.592 --> 32:50.009
and he said it was...

32:50.093 --> 32:52.219
- He just heard it as he was climbing out...
- United 175?

32:52.304 --> 32:53.888
United 175 heavy, yes.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.307
- And what about American 11?
- American 11's still... It's nothing.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.933
He's just still going slow, you know.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.227
He might be going into Newark
or Kennedy or something,

33:00.312 --> 33:02.647
I don't know.
You know, I have no idea.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.491
<i>Continental 1002, Newark Tower.
Good morning.</i>

33:17.454 --> 33:19.330
Why don't you try the next one down?

33:19.623 --> 33:21.707
An arctic fish. How about "char"?

33:25.796 --> 33:27.129
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Dahl.</i>

33:27.214 --> 33:29.465
As we make this turn, those of you
on the left side of the airplane

33:29.549 --> 33:33.135
<i>have a beautiful view of lower Manhattan
and the New York City skyline.</i>

33:33.220 --> 33:34.804
- Looks nice out there.
- Huh?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.681
Looks nice out there.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.818
What do you mean there's no one there?
Well, you guys must have a backup.

33:48.902 --> 33:51.362
Whatever information they got,
they got to give it to us right away.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.530
All right, good.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.157
Hijack controller, no one at the desk.
No backup.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.826
- Looks like they're on vacation.
- No backup?

33:56.910 --> 33:58.327
There's no backup.
There's no one at the desk.

33:58.412 --> 34:00.579
Who were you talking to downstairs?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.206
I'm talking to this guy.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.917
He's in the conference room.
There's nobody else in there.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.044
I'm relaying the information,
and then he's moving...

34:07.129 --> 34:10.589
We got it. We got the tapes.
Boston Center got the tapes pulled.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.757
- They said, "We have some planes."
- Hold on.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.677
That's what he said,
"We have some planes."

34:14.761 --> 34:16.387
That was the suspicious transmission.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.888
Was there any voice recognition?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.639
I'm tracking it.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.183
Jesus Christ.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.147
Med Express 77, maintain 10,000.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.690
The Kennedy altimeter's 2996.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.150
Keep an eye on it. Now watch.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.277
Delta 351, altimeter 2992.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.530
Chilean 4369, New York altimeter, 2996.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.407
- Paul, what do you got?
- Hey, Mike, how you doing?

34:36.491 --> 34:40.244
American 11.
Possible hijacking on American 11.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.456
He's southbound, 767.
Nobody's talking to him.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.125
I just called the room up
and let them know about it.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.918
They're not tracking him either, right now.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.378
Where was the target last time?

34:49.463 --> 34:51.464
Last time it was tracked
in New York at Kennedy.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.549
- He's heading for the south.
- American 11, New York.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.759
What do you want me to check?

34:59.723 --> 35:01.265
Target's gone.

35:01.808 --> 35:05.186
Paul. Paul, the target for
American 11 just disappeared.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.605
- Just disappeared where?
- Right around Manhattan.

35:07.689 --> 35:08.773
It just disappeared?

35:08.857 --> 35:09.857
It was right there.
It just disappeared.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.318
I was talking to the other aircraft.
The target just disappeared.

35:12.402 --> 35:15.613
Call Kennedy up. Find out if they have it.
We don't know where American is, all right?

35:15.697 --> 35:17.573
Call Kennedy tower up,
see if they have him down there,

35:17.657 --> 35:19.325
and call Newark tower
and see if they have him there.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.534
Okay.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.954
What do we got, boys? Anything?

35:24.039 --> 35:26.290
All right, sir, you need me to go ahead
and start a recall for you?

35:26.374 --> 35:27.416
Yes, initiate that.

35:27.501 --> 35:28.751
Okay, great.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.796
What's the status with Otis?
Are those planes ready?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.839
Foxy, what you got?
You got anything?

35:33.924 --> 35:36.550
MCC, battle stations call made 0838.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.220
Otis attained battle stations at 40.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.097
08? Colonel, 0840,

35:42.182 --> 35:44.183
slams at battle stations.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.519
Otis at battle stations. Copy.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.271
<i>Get me something.
Nothing's squawking.</i>

35:49.356 --> 35:52.233
MCC, Boston lost American 11.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.984
They don't see him anymore
on their scopes.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.403
They think maybe he went
below radar coverage.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.988
They have no idea where he is.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.658
We've got Otis.
Have the battle ready.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.868
We need scramble authority.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.161
<i>Copy that.</i>

36:04.246 --> 36:06.997
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

36:07.707 --> 36:08.707
Copy that.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.085
<i>Okay, let's get those
Otis birds in the air!</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:12.628
Scramble Otis!

36:12.712 --> 36:15.339
This is Huntress
with an active air defense scramble.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.341
<i>I repeat, active air defense scramble.</i>

36:17.425 --> 36:20.177
<i>Time is 0846.</i>

36:20.470 --> 36:23.764
<i>I authenticate November-November.</i>

36:26.768 --> 36:28.811
- Greg, look at the World Trade Center.
- What?

36:28.895 --> 36:32.565
Look at the Trade Center, man.
Bob, you see that?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.693
Man, that's a lot of smoke.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.111
I can't believe that.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.534
Yeah, take a look at the
World Trade Center.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.911
No, I have no idea.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.873
I'm getting reports from numerous aircraft
about smoke in Manhattan.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.249
A lot of smoke.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.877
A lot of smoke coming out
of the North Tower.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.797
Thumbser, go ahead.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.800
The American was over Manhattan

36:59.926 --> 37:02.052
- A small plane? Is that confirmed?
- when I lost any sign of...

37:02.888 --> 37:05.055
- Ben, I just got... New York called.
- Yeah?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.932
They got smoke out of the
World Trade Center.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.350
- Smoke?
- They think a small plane

37:08.435 --> 37:10.102
- A small plane?
- has crashed into it.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.186
- Small plane.
- I don't know.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.271
That's what they're telling me.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.189
A small plane went into the
World Trade Center.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.191
- You might want to have a look.
- Okay.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.569
Sir.

37:18.945 --> 37:22.990
CNN's reporting a light civil aircraft
has just hit the World Trade Center.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.242
MCC?

37:25.327 --> 37:29.288
<i>MCC, CNN has just reported a light aircraft
has hit the World Trade Center.</i>

37:29.372 --> 37:32.374
Bill, get me CNN up on screen three, will you?

37:32.792 --> 37:33.792
- Ben?
- Yeah.

37:33.877 --> 37:34.919
New York Center called.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.921
They were tracking the primary target,
they've lost it.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.672
They said they'd lost American 11.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.424
- Where did they lose it at?
- Somewhere over the city.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.550
- Over the city?
- Yeah.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.052
- He's down over the city?
- They don't know

37:43.136 --> 37:44.637
if he's under the radar coverage
out there or not.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.264
All right. Get in touch with the metro towers,
see if they got a visual.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.766
- Hey, it's coming up now.
- I'll call TRACON, see if...

37:48.850 --> 37:50.267
- Jesus.
- Oh, my...

37:50.352 --> 37:52.686
<i>...we're getting reports this morning,
that a plane</i>

37:52.771 --> 37:56.357
<i>has crashed into one of the towers
of the World Trade Center.</i>

37:56.441 --> 37:59.485
<i>CNN Center right now
is just beginning to work on this story.</i>

37:59.569 --> 38:02.863
<i>Obviously calling our sources
and trying to figure out exactly what happened.</i>

38:02.948 --> 38:07.409
<i>But clearly something relatively devastating
happening this morning there</i>

38:07.494 --> 38:09.495
- <i>in the south end of the island...</i>
- I don't know.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.956
I'll tell you what, that is not
a small plane. No way.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.040
It's huge.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.167
A Cessna would have bounced off that.
Look at the size of that hole!

38:15.251 --> 38:16.418
Look at all them people sitting...

38:16.503 --> 38:19.421
I got a bad feeling about this.
I'll tell you right now.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.799
Is that American 11?
Is that who they were tracking?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.759
- Nobody's telling us anything.
- No info. I have no info.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.595
Well, which way are we looking here?
If we're looking...

38:26.680 --> 38:29.682
It looks like the sun's on that side of the building,
so we're looking north.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.559
He came from our left.
He had to come from the west.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.895
That aircraft came in
from the west into that building.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.981
- Who could it be?
- Now where's American 11?

38:37.065 --> 38:39.483
You know what I want you to do?
Get in touch with the NYPD.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.319
See if they have any information
on what caused that in the Trade Center.

38:42.404 --> 38:43.696
Look at the size of that explosion.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.157
<i>...Sean, you're on the air right now.
What can you tell us about...</i>

38:47.242 --> 38:48.492
And, folks, Captain Dahl.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.036
We've reached our cruising altitude
of 35,000 feet

38:51.121 --> 38:53.455
and I'm going ahead and turn
the "Fasten Seat Belts" sign off.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.499
<i>That is your signal
you are safe to move about the cabin.</i>

38:55.583 --> 38:56.917
We got the seatbelt sign off.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.043
<i>However, when you are in your seats</i>

38:58.128 --> 38:59.378
<i>I'll ask you to keep your seatbelts
loosely fastened,</i>

38:59.462 --> 39:01.964
<i>as you never know when we'll get
some bumps we're not expecting.</i>

39:02.048 --> 39:04.675
<i>Our flying time today again
is 5 hours and 25 minutes,</i>

39:04.759 --> 39:06.760
<i>and in spite of that short delay
back there in Newark</i>

39:06.845 --> 39:09.722
<i>I'm still projecting
an on-time arrival in San Francisco.</i>

39:09.806 --> 39:12.307
<i>I'll update you on the weather
as we get a little closer.</i>

39:12.392 --> 39:14.309
<i>In the interim now,
I'll ask you to sit back and enjoy</i>

39:14.394 --> 39:16.562
<i>the outstanding service
of our fine flight attendants.</i>

39:16.646 --> 39:19.732
<i>If there's anything we in the cockpit can do
to make your ride more enjoyable,</i>

39:19.816 --> 39:21.108
<i>please don't hesitate to ask.</i>

39:21.192 --> 39:22.526
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:32.912 --> 39:34.413
Hey, can I get a copy of the manifest?

39:34.497 --> 39:35.539
Oh, sure.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.332
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.417
I appreciate it.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.543
Yeah, no problem.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.503
Looks pretty good, huh?

39:41.796 --> 39:43.047
I love these light loads.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.381
I do, too.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.510
I knew you were gonna say that,
so I've planned.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.887
We've got...

39:49.971 --> 39:53.474
We have reservations there.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.726
And there.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.438
Fedex 7852, we heard it was a small plane
that hit the World Trade Center.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.773
- That's the last that we heard.
- Roger.

40:00.857 --> 40:04.026
Eagle 755, you contact departure on 126.8.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.737
- I gave you that Eagle 755 also, okay?
- Another one?

40:06.821 --> 40:09.531
- Yeah, Eagle 755.
- 755. Got it.

40:09.616 --> 40:13.368
Toggle 9445, you contact approach on 120.8.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.120
- Chris, I need you to take this one also.
- Got it.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.873
Hey, Dave, you got an untracked target
five miles east of Allentown.

40:17.957 --> 40:18.916
Thank you.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.836
United 175, I need you
to reset your transponder squawk 2374.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.218
United 175, New York.
You read the radio?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.471
- Call American 11 again.
- I'll try him again.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.348
- Paul, neither airport had one.
- Maybe... He must've landed.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.891
Newark heard nothing from him,
Kennedy heard...

40:35.975 --> 40:37.392
- Try the towers again.
- I'll try again.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.770
He's gotta be somewhere.
He's gotta go somewhere.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.939
United 175, New York.
If you read the radio, ident.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.357
Traffic's 9 o'clock and seven.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.944
Southwestbound Delta Boeing 73,
same altitude.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.531
United 175, New York.

40:51.699 --> 40:52.950
United...

40:53.034 --> 40:56.411
Paul, United. I think we got another one.
The guy has dropped his transponder off.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.705
United 175, New York. He's out by Allentown.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.165
- United 175.
- Thumbser.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.710
If you have United 175, you need
to switch him back to... The traffic room.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.213
No, I'm not talking to him.
I'm not talking to him. I know.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.632
Delta 2433, stand by.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.135
I can't take any more airplanes.

41:11.219 --> 41:14.304
He's busy enough.
We'll take care of it. We'll take care of it.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.640
- We'll take care of it.
- They're standing by, right now.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.810
Watch that Delta 2315.
He's aimed right at him. The same altitude.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.770
He's starting to get close to him.
You see that?

41:22.397 --> 41:23.438
Please.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.649
Give me a chance to work.
Just stay back!

41:25.733 --> 41:28.360
Just give me a chance
to work here, all right?

41:28.945 --> 41:31.113
United 175, New York,
if you read the radio,

41:31.197 --> 41:33.824
you have traffic at your 9 o'clock
and four miles southwestbound,

41:33.908 --> 41:35.492
same altitude. It's a Boeing 73.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.995
I'm telling you this is another hijack.
I'm telling you.

41:38.079 --> 41:41.331
United 175, traffic is your 9 o'clock
in five miles.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.083
Jesus. Do you have that Delta?

41:43.168 --> 41:46.962
Delta! Delta 2315, traffic 2 o'clock!

41:47.046 --> 41:50.048
Five miles, southeastbound, 757.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.009
- Traffic, three miles.
- Turn him. Turn him.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.510
- 1 o'clock!
- Turn to one and a half.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.387
Heading southeastbound.
12 o'clock now!

41:55.471 --> 41:56.597
No distance! He's right on top of you!

41:56.681 --> 41:58.098
I'm telling you right now.
This is another hijacking.

41:58.141 --> 42:01.435
- Delta 2315, he's right on top of you.
- This is a hijacking.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.159
Delta 2315, you still there?

42:22.415 --> 42:25.959
<i>That's a roger, New York. We are clear.
Delta 2315. Over.</i>

42:26.377 --> 42:27.628
Paul, he just went behind him.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.046
- Holy shit.
- Good. Good.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.131
Good job, sir. Good job.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.635
<i>She was sitting inside her apartment,
and she looked up and saw the side</i>

42:34.719 --> 42:36.595
- <i>of the World Trade Center...</i>
- All right. Thank you much.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.597
<i>explode into flames and black smoke.</i>

42:38.681 --> 42:40.599
- Excuse me.
- If they hijacked them...

42:40.683 --> 42:43.685
New York Center says they got confirmation
that it was a commercial airliner

42:43.770 --> 42:45.395
- that hit the Trade Center.
- Well, that's it.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.065
- That was American 11.
- It had to be American 11.

42:48.149 --> 42:51.652
What the hell is going on?
But how could he hit the building?

42:51.736 --> 42:54.863
I mean, why would he hit the building?
Even if it is American 11, why...

42:54.989 --> 42:57.324
- It's clear and fifty.
- You don't get a pilot flying a plane...

42:57.408 --> 42:59.076
Either they're gonna ditch it
in the Hudson...

42:59.160 --> 43:01.286
- They're not gonna do this.
- There's no way. No way.

43:01.371 --> 43:03.622
Jesus, how many people
are in that building?

43:04.666 --> 43:06.500
Ben? Ben?

43:06.876 --> 43:08.961
I'm sorry, New York Center
wants you on the phone right now.

43:09.045 --> 43:10.837
Yeah. Yes, New York.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.133
Wait a minute, hold on.
They think they got another hijack,

43:15.218 --> 43:16.551
- and it's headed for New York.
- Another one?

43:16.636 --> 43:17.803
We got another hijack?

43:17.887 --> 43:20.138
All right, United 175.
Get him up on there.

43:20.223 --> 43:21.473
How many people are in that building?

43:21.557 --> 43:22.724
Where is that military liaison?

43:22.809 --> 43:25.185
Can somebody help us out?
We need some help here.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.354
We're trying to get the military involved.

43:27.689 --> 43:28.689
We can't get anybody at headquarters.

43:29.649 --> 43:32.901
All right, listen, you take care of your house,
we'll take care of this business.

43:32.986 --> 43:35.028
Okay. Let me know
if anything else develops.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.156
United 175, and it's headed
straight for New York.

43:38.241 --> 43:41.368
United 175, New York. United 175.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.245
United 175, New York.

43:43.705 --> 43:46.290
United 175 here.
This guy's at, like, 10,000 feet a minute,

43:46.416 --> 43:47.749
- and he's still going down.
- I heard. I heard.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.668
United 175, New York.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.505
This guy's dropping
like a manhole cover now, Paul.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.259
He's still descending eastbound
towards New York.

43:57.343 --> 44:00.012
This aircraft is going down,
I'm telling you right now.

44:00.096 --> 44:01.221
Call the military up.

44:01.264 --> 44:02.639
- Find out where they are.
- Okay.

44:02.724 --> 44:03.724
Are you listening to me?

44:03.808 --> 44:06.018
This guy is going straight down
into the ground, I'm telling you.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.227
He's not answering me.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.313
We're not talking to him.
He's descending.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.897
It's like 6,000 to 8,000 feet a minute now.

44:11.024 --> 44:13.817
- Dave, you still not talking to that guy?
- No, I'm not.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.070
He's going right through
everybody else's traffic.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.532
The target's gone. It's gone.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.909
- The target's gone.
- The target's gone.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.414
We don't have him anymore.
We just lost him.

44:27.749 --> 44:31.752
All right, hold on. Hold on.
I got a primary on a target.

44:31.878 --> 44:33.795
- Where?
- He's rapidly descending.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.464
Can you see that right here?

44:35.548 --> 44:37.716
He's coming down quick, yeah.
Can you see that?

44:37.800 --> 44:38.925
Well, who is it?

44:39.052 --> 44:40.052
I don't know.

44:41.054 --> 44:42.095
You see him out the window?

44:42.180 --> 44:43.347
I don't know.

44:43.431 --> 44:44.765
Is he out there?

44:45.099 --> 44:46.433
Yeah, descending rapidly.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.559
No, there he is. There he is.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.436
- Where?
- Right there. Over the Verrazano Bridge.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.897
Oh, yeah. Look how fast he's going.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.774
No, he's going right up
the Hudson River center.

44:53.858 --> 44:54.941
Oh, my God.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.115
Jesus! Shit!

45:02.241 --> 45:03.408
- What?
- How does he do that?

45:03.451 --> 45:06.286
- <i>There was then an explosion inside...</i>
- Damn it!

45:06.371 --> 45:09.373
<i>The building's exploding right now!
You got people running up the street!</i>

45:09.457 --> 45:11.041
<i>I don't know what the hell is going on.</i>

45:11.125 --> 45:13.877
Did you see that?
Did you see that, sir?

45:16.089 --> 45:17.964
I'll have to call you back.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.383
Oh, my God.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.176
<i>American, stand by.</i>

45:24.263 --> 45:25.597
Holy shit!

45:25.765 --> 45:27.265
Jesus Christ.

45:40.696 --> 45:43.156
<i>Be advised there's a major incident
over New York right now.</i>

45:43.241 --> 45:46.159
Shawna, what do you got?
What do you got, Shawna?

45:46.244 --> 45:47.994
Boston said that...

45:49.080 --> 45:53.417
Boston just said they have
another hijacked aircraft. United 175.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.877
Copy that. We've got another hijack.

45:55.962 --> 45:59.005
We've got two hijacks.
175, also out of Boston.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.091
Are they... Does Boston... Is...

46:01.175 --> 46:03.427
Get on with FAA. Who was that?

46:03.970 --> 46:05.512
There's no confirmation, sir.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.265
<i>MCC, we need our planes
over Manhattan.</i>

46:08.349 --> 46:10.183
<i>We need those Otis birds
over Manhattan now.</i>

46:10.268 --> 46:13.019
You got it!
All right, weapons! Weapons!

46:17.900 --> 46:19.067
You want any sugar in your coffee?

46:19.152 --> 46:20.193
I'm fine for now, thanks.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.362
- What would you like to drink?
- I'm glued to this.

46:22.447 --> 46:24.030
Coffee or juice?

46:24.574 --> 46:26.616
- Yeah, I'll take some coffee.
- Hi, guys.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.535
You know, I'm gonna serve you guys
after first,

46:28.619 --> 46:30.787
'cause there's only six,
if that's okay.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.747
It was a beautiful take-off.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.459
So you're still okay with the hot?

46:35.543 --> 46:38.420
All right, well, then, we'll bring you
something to drink after that.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.547
- Yeah, it's like football with no padding.
- Here you go, sir.

46:40.715 --> 46:42.215
Hope you all enjoy this.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.468
And I'll be right with you, guys.

47:04.530 --> 47:08.074
And here we go. All right.

47:08.201 --> 47:09.701
- Why don't we turn this around?
- Thank you.

47:09.744 --> 47:10.869
- If you could help me.
- Thank you.

47:10.912 --> 47:12.037
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Thank you.

47:12.121 --> 47:13.622
- Thanks a lot.
- Enjoy.

47:33.100 --> 47:36.353
New York Center wants everything stopped
going to their airports and through...

47:36.437 --> 47:39.022
All right, Tony, issue a ground stop
for New York Center.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.982
Nothing goes into New York Center.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.443
- Got it.
- At least the first tier on that. Yeah.

47:43.903 --> 47:47.531
In fact... Hey, you know what?
Let's stop Boston, New York,

47:47.615 --> 47:49.366
and then maybe stop Washington, too.

47:49.450 --> 47:52.077
Yeah, whatever's necessary.
Just get them stopped now.

47:52.161 --> 47:55.455
I don't want any more planes
on their frequency taking off.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.625
Boston, we have no confirmation...

47:58.709 --> 47:59.709
Copy type and tail.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.295
Foxy!

48:02.380 --> 48:05.799
I'm hearing about another hijack.
Keep your ears open.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.717
Too much traffic.
We can't get the clearance.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.386
That's not acceptable.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.679
They're not giving it to us.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.765
If you need to, get on the line
and get the clearance for them,

48:13.849 --> 48:15.725
but don't take that from them.

48:15.810 --> 48:17.852
<i>Where are those Otis planes?
Are we over Manhattan yet?</i>

48:17.937 --> 48:19.646
<i>What's going on? MCC.</i>

48:19.730 --> 48:21.648
What's the status on Otis, Foxy?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.692
We're still trying to get a clearance, sir.

48:23.776 --> 48:27.237
We're getting no clearance from the FAA
to get those birds over Manhattan.

48:27.321 --> 48:28.863
What do you want me to tell weapons?

48:28.948 --> 48:31.199
Screw the FAA.
Send those Otis planes now.

48:31.284 --> 48:33.076
Get them over Manhattan.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.955
He says forget about the FAA.
Get those birds over Manhattan now.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.508
United 93, Cleveland Center.
Good morning.

48:49.135 --> 48:52.512
United 93, Cleveland Center, 119.7.
Good day.

48:54.724 --> 48:55.765
You have the aircraft.

48:55.850 --> 48:56.850
I have the aircraft.

49:05.318 --> 49:08.612
Hi. Breakfast, guys.
Here's one with juice.

49:08.696 --> 49:09.654
Thank you.

49:09.739 --> 49:11.531
I'm bringing the other one
with coffee in one second.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.866
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy, guys. See you later.

49:12.950 --> 49:13.950
- Thanks, Deb.
- See you in a bit.

49:14.702 --> 49:15.994
What do you need over here?

49:18.956 --> 49:23.543
But you know, with girls I can't, I could never,
you know, I couldn't control...

49:28.883 --> 49:31.343
As soon as I get on the ground,
I'll give her a call.

49:31.427 --> 49:33.511
- You have kids?
- Yeah, I do.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.930
I have a 11-month-old daughter.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.726
Eleven months. How's that?
You getting any sleep at night?

49:39.810 --> 49:42.729
She's finally beginning to settle down now,
so everything's looking good.

49:42.813 --> 49:46.316
My anniversary's coming up,
I'm taking my wife to London for a couple days.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.361
Well, that should be good.
Yeah, I've been to London a couple times.

49:49.445 --> 49:51.154
You know, we're gonna do the usual.

49:51.238 --> 49:55.075
A little sightseeing, do a couple plays
and just kind of get away.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.952
I've got Otis in the air,
and two more at Langley.

49:58.037 --> 49:59.829
Four planes. That's all I've got.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.707
I'm gonna need some support.
I'm gonna need more planes.

50:02.792 --> 50:07.170
I've got Otis headed to Manhattan and...
No, the FAA is giving us problems.

50:07.254 --> 50:10.465
...all the other fighter planes
that are on the East Coast. Oceana.

50:10.549 --> 50:12.342
No, I sent them anyway.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.886
Right now, Langley's sitting
at battle stations, sir.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.262
Copy that.

50:16.555 --> 50:18.014
Okay. MCC!

50:18.891 --> 50:21.893
Boston is telling us
American 11 is still in the air.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.062
- What?
- American 11 is still in the air.

50:24.146 --> 50:25.730
We don't know who those planes are.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.066
- American 11 is still flying?
- Headed towards Washington.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.150
God damn it!

50:29.235 --> 50:32.153
All right, surveillance, we got American 11,
heading towards Washington now!

50:32.279 --> 50:35.573
Let's go. I want you to light up every track
south of New York over Jersey.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.867
- Colonel. Colonel.
- Hang on. Hang on, sir.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.035
Yes, go, MCC.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.329
Boston is saying that American 11

50:41.455 --> 50:44.541
<i>is heading towards Washington now.
That it's not one of the flights</i>

50:44.625 --> 50:47.377
that went into the Trade Centers,
but it's heading towards Washington.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.212
We gotta scramble
those Langley birds right now.

50:49.296 --> 50:51.297
- <i>What the fuck?</i>
- Hold on, sir.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.967
Scramble Langley.
Scramble Langley to Washington.

50:54.093 --> 50:56.010
- Scramble Langley, weapons.
- Copy that.

50:56.137 --> 50:58.054
- Scramble them to Washington.
- Scramble Langley.

50:58.139 --> 51:00.890
No, we just got a report.
We're getting bad stuff from the FAA.

51:00.975 --> 51:04.561
Bad stuff from the FAA all around.
They just told us that 11 was still flying.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.229
We thought 11 went into the tower.

51:06.313 --> 51:09.482
All parties acknowledge with initials.
Command posts.

51:09.567 --> 51:13.194
Tower. Approach. Giant Killer.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.280
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Here's what I want.

51:15.364 --> 51:17.073
I want you to contact all the centers.

51:17.158 --> 51:20.076
I want to know about any aircraft
that they deem suspicious.

51:20.161 --> 51:24.789
There's NORDO or lost transponder,
off-course, change altitude.

51:24.874 --> 51:28.084
And let's get it on that board down there
and start sharing this information.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.836
Particularly with the military.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.588
Where is that military liaison?

51:31.672 --> 51:35.049
Go get him.
Yeah, tell him I need to speak to him now.

51:36.427 --> 51:39.596
Indy Center just called.
They're missing an American 77.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.431
They lost it 25 minutes ago.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.558
- It deviated off...
- American 77.

51:43.684 --> 51:46.478
- American 77.
- Out of Indianapolis Center.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.731
They said that he lost his transponder
after he turned off-course.

51:49.815 --> 51:53.276
We got an American 77 out of Dulles,
lost the transponder.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.821
All right, I need...
I want last-known position, speed and altitude.

51:56.906 --> 51:59.282
I want it in his track.
I want to know where he's heading.

51:59.366 --> 52:01.451
We just had two go into the city.

52:01.535 --> 52:04.996
And, you know, anything is suspect now,
especially if he's heading toward the city.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.998
I need last-known position and track.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.959
All right, do you know
who that second airplane was?

52:10.044 --> 52:11.628
Okay. If you find out, let me know.

52:11.712 --> 52:14.798
Boston's tracking another one, Delta 1989.

52:14.882 --> 52:18.134
He's another Boston-to-LAX, 767.

52:18.219 --> 52:19.511
Right now he's on course.

52:19.595 --> 52:22.430
They are talking to him,
but they're very concerned about that flight

52:22.515 --> 52:24.766
because it's the exact same profile
as these last two.

52:24.850 --> 52:29.145
All right, so listen, fellas. I want you
to get a ground stop out across the nation.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.272
I don't want anybody else
coming into our airspace.

52:31.357 --> 52:34.025
- How many have I got airborne now?
- 4,000 or 5,000.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.485
- Huh?
- Between 4,000 and 5,000.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.029
- 4,200.
- 4,200? Jesus Christ.

52:38.113 --> 52:40.156
All right, no more departures anywhere.
You got that?

52:40.241 --> 52:43.326
Call Boston. Call Cleveland.
No more departures.

52:44.119 --> 52:48.414
Copy. Boston-to-LA and that's Delta 1989,
suspected hijack.

52:48.749 --> 52:52.252
Eagle flight 248,
contact Cleveland Center, 134.6.

52:54.755 --> 52:58.550
John, there's a suspected hijack
from Center at Boston, all right?

52:58.634 --> 53:00.343
I need you to confirm
when you can, all right?

53:00.427 --> 53:02.929
Let me know if you hear anything.
Delta 1989.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.931
I'll let you know. Soon as I can.

53:05.015 --> 53:08.017
United 93, Cleveland Center.
Go ahead.

53:08.477 --> 53:12.605
Cleveland Center, United 93. Level 350.
Still have that light chop.

53:22.283 --> 53:24.367
"Beware cockpit intrusion."

53:24.785 --> 53:27.370
"Two aircraft hit the World Trade Center."

53:27.454 --> 53:30.582
But we just left Newark.
The weather was beautiful.

53:30.666 --> 53:32.208
That's gotta be student pilots.

53:32.293 --> 53:35.086
I'm gonna... Let me just confirm this.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.755
What have you got?
Do we have anything on 11?

53:37.840 --> 53:39.132
You're spotting nothing?

53:39.216 --> 53:42.051
Come on, guys. Beat the bushes.
Where is this guy? What's he doing?

53:42.136 --> 53:45.305
I got two F-16s ready to turn
and burn toward Washington.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.056
I need to know the ROE, sir.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.684
<i>Sir, what do you want me to do
when we intercept American 11?</i>

53:49.768 --> 53:52.604
Do we give them nines in their nose, sir?
I need to know that.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.564
If we engage, when do we engage?

53:54.690 --> 53:57.400
- How do we get the authority to get...
- <i>Colonel, I need to know</i>

53:57.484 --> 54:00.236
with these Langley birds what I'm gonna do.
Rules of engagement, sir.

54:00.321 --> 54:01.738
Do we shoot this flight down?

54:01.822 --> 54:04.324
How high up do we have to go? SecDef?

54:05.951 --> 54:07.493
Vice President?

54:08.078 --> 54:10.288
The President has to make the call.
Yes, sir.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.415
Sir, I need rules of engagement.
What do I do, sir?

54:12.499 --> 54:13.499
Yes, sir. Hold on.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.752
MCC, I'm on with CONR right now,

54:15.836 --> 54:18.254
requesting clarification
for rules of engagement.

54:21.216 --> 54:22.300
Yeah.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.177
We'll let you know when Langley's airborne.

54:24.428 --> 54:27.055
Yes, sir. ID type and tail. Yes, sir.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.099
All right, thank you, sir.

54:31.727 --> 54:33.436
<i>We have no shoot-down authority.</i>

54:33.520 --> 54:35.939
No shoot-down authority at this time.

54:36.023 --> 54:38.983
It is ID type and tail.
ID type and tail.

54:39.068 --> 54:43.363
Shoot-down authority comes from the President
and the President only.

54:43.739 --> 54:46.449
How long is it gonna take
to get that authority, sir?

54:46.533 --> 54:48.576
Where the hell is the liaison?

54:48.661 --> 54:51.079
Boston's stopping.
Boston's already stopped their...

54:51.163 --> 54:52.163
Good.

54:52.247 --> 54:54.290
You gotta work the military on this one.

54:54.375 --> 54:56.709
Colonel, listen.
We got a bad situation going on.

54:56.794 --> 54:59.963
I need you to do everything you can
to get these lines of communication open.

55:00.047 --> 55:03.257
We got at least two planes
into that goddamn building.

55:03.342 --> 55:06.094
We got multiple situations going on.
We've given you people...

55:06.178 --> 55:09.347
Listen, I know it's not your job to do this,
but you've gotta do what you can.

55:09.431 --> 55:13.977
We gotta get jets on every one
of those aircraft on that board.

55:14.061 --> 55:17.271
Are you in direct contact with the Pentagon
or are you talking to some liaison?

55:17.356 --> 55:18.481
No, no, no, I'm talking to them.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.943
They understand the gravity of the situation.
I'll give you the best update I can...

55:22.069 --> 55:23.945
- No, I need action is what I need.
- I understand.

55:24.029 --> 55:25.571
- I need action.
- I understand.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.033
Exactly.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.578
And long, long quarters
with hardly any breaks.

55:32.705 --> 55:34.414
And, yeah, it's...

55:36.417 --> 55:38.334
You take out all your aggression

55:38.419 --> 55:41.629
and all your, you know,
all your shit for the day.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.259
I think golf is pretty much
all I'm up for now.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.303
Yeah? Well, not like you have time
for anything else.

55:51.390 --> 55:52.807
You know, but you can make time, though.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.100
No, you're right.

55:54.184 --> 55:57.645
You're absolutely right.
That's why I had to... I mean...

55:57.730 --> 56:01.649
When I left school, I knew
I just had to continue rugby in some way.

56:01.734 --> 56:03.359
So there were...

56:03.444 --> 56:05.903
There was, like, this league that started.

56:05.988 --> 56:09.866
It's kind of like a city league.
It's kind of my outlet.

56:41.523 --> 56:44.484
Would you like anything to drink?

56:44.568 --> 56:45.610
No. I'm fine, thank you.

56:45.694 --> 56:47.070
- Sure?
- Yes.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.679
There you are.

57:54.763 --> 57:55.763
Thank you.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.265
- Have a nice morning.
- Thank you.

58:00.894 --> 58:01.894
Excuse me.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.729
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you, my dear.

58:03.814 --> 58:04.814
You're welcome.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.118
Not having breakfast?

58:17.202 --> 58:18.870
No, thank you.
I'm gonna go to sleep in a minute.

58:18.954 --> 58:19.996
A little early?

58:20.080 --> 58:22.665
You wouldn't have any Scotch
you could put in there, would you?

58:22.749 --> 58:24.584
- It'd be $4.
- No, I'm just kidding.

58:24.668 --> 58:26.669
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58:26.753 --> 58:28.004
Thank you.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.088
Care for coffee?

58:29.256 --> 58:30.256
Oh, yes.

58:43.604 --> 58:46.480
And, you know, you're coming up
the Jersey Turnpike.

58:46.565 --> 58:48.691
And I'll tell you,
New York was like,

58:48.775 --> 58:50.985
it was like Emerald City, you know?

58:51.069 --> 58:52.111
Yeah. Beautiful.

58:52.196 --> 58:53.779
It was beautiful.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.199
The sun coming up behind the buildings.

59:21.725 --> 59:24.143
Time for a drink, even for dinner?

59:24.228 --> 59:25.228
Yeah, sounds great.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:19.448
We've got three kids at home,
so that's a full-time job right there.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.415
And you wanted the hot breakfast, right?

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.710
Everything okay here? Good.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.950
He's got a bomb!

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.000
He's got a bomb!

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.543
Get back! Get back!

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:13.919
What's going on?

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.588
Move! Don't stop! Go! Go!

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.644
Open the door.
Open the door and nobody will be hurt.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.855
Jesus Christ. Go! Go!

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.820
Sit down and fasten your seat belts!

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.030
Do it!

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:43.282
No, no.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.409
- You want to get that?
- You got the aircraft?

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.119
I have the airplane.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.623
Go! Go! Go!

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.504
<i>Get out of here,
get out of here! Mayday!</i>

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.131
Get out of here!

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.216
No!

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:04.428
Tom.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:07.640
He started to scream, and somebody said,
"Get out of here, get out of here."

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.114
No!

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:03.028
No! No, please, no!

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.655
Jesus Christ.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.616
There's a guy who got stabbed.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.826
- He what?
- They stabbed this guy.

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:53.329
In first class, they stabbed him.
It's the truth.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.789
- Who is that?
- There's a bomb, there's a man with a bomb.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.666
- What?
- And they have stabbed a passenger.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.668
- Oh, my God!
- Where's Debbie?

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:03.130
The men took her. They took Debbie.
They grabbed her.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.465
Where is Debbie?

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.842
They're taking over the plane.
They took Debbie.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:07.968
What?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.890
<i>United 93, air traffic for you is
1 o'clock, 12 miles eastbound 371.</i>

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.854
<i>United 1523, did you hear somebody,</i>

01:04:18.939 --> 01:04:20.898
<i>did you hear some other aircraft
on the frequency here?</i>

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.107
Fuck!

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.526
Anything?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.920
<i>United 93, Cleveland.
Verify your altitude.</i>

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:51.136
United 93, Cleveland.
How do you hear?

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.644
United 93, Cleveland.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.941
United 93, Cleveland.
Verify your altitude.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.820
Tom, I'm getting no response out of a United 93.
No response at all.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.572
- Ninety-three?
- Correct.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:10.656
All right.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.660
<i>Delta 1989, Cleveland Center, 2249.
Good day.</i>

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.038
Delta 1989, roger.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.833
Hey, Tom. Delta just called in.
He sounds good.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.543
- This guy here?
- I don't think it's a hijack.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.712
- He took a turn of a 330 heading.
- It doesn't matter.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.589
They said he was hijacked.
They placed a phone call.

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:28.632
- Keep working him, all right?
- I'm just telling you.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:29.967
I don't know if we have one or two,

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.511
but I know he is descending
on his own without a clearance.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.597
Wait a minute. Delta.
What about Delta?

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:38.767
Delta's answering. Delta's fine so far.
The only one I don't have is the United 93.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.603
He's not responding, and he is...

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:44.189
He was descending on his own.
He appears to be climbing now.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.775
Cleveland just called.
There's a United 93,

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.944
the controller heard screams
coming from the cockpit.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.779
- Sounds like the American 11.
- Jesus.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.449
This is starting to look like a pattern.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.492
Where was that aircraft last known?
Do you know?

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:56.869
Which way is he heading?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.495
We gotta get track information
on these guys.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.332
He was a Newark-to-San Francisco flight.
He's still on course.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.876
All right, get all the adjacent centers.
Notify them.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.169
In every direction.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.504
And keep me advised on flight 93.

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:10.799
Hey, Ben? Ben? Delta's fine.
He's not a hijack.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.509
- Cleveland just called.
- Delta's not? Good.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:15.179
Take him off the board. Delta 1989.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:19.808
Yeah. Yes, sir. Four planes.
That's all I've got.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.812
I can't defend the whole Eastern Seaboard
with four planes.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:24.938
What do you got?

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:28.192
Washington's on the phone.
They said they've got American 77 lost.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.861
He just went missing, out of Dulles.
He's supposed to go to LAX.

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:31.987
This is another one?

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:34.114
What? What did she say?

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.491
<i>American 77 coming out of Dulles</i>

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:36.992
heading west, going to LAX.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.744
Light me up every track, guys.
What do you got?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.622
I don't know how many more there could be
in the air, sir, but the point is this.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.083
We've gotta get them
before they're within range of Washington.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.834
We gotta get them
before they're 60 miles,

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.795
50 miles minimum,
or we're not gonna have a play.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.421
We're not gonna be able
to protect the Capitol.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.110
Come on. Come on, guys.
Answer it, please, answer.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.363
Oh, my God, there he is.
He's on the floor.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.864
We need something to bandage him with.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.950
Anybody a doctor? Medic?

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.201
She's an EMT.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:20.661
She's an EMT.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:26.959
I keep trying to call the cockpit.
I can't get through.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.503
I need you to move over.

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:31.213
What is going on?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.468
Okay. Okay.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.233
Oh, come on.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.239
<i>United 93, do you hear Cleveland Center?
Ident, please.</i>

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:16.300
<i>Yes, I did, 797,
and we couldn't tell what it was, either.</i>

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:19.761
<i>Okay. United 93, Cleveland.
If you hear the Center, ident.</i>

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:26.518
I got you.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.613
Hi, my name is Sandy Bradshaw.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.616
I'm on United flight 93
from Newark to San Francisco.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.243
The airplane has been hijacked
by three guys with knives.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.872
One of them's got, like,
a bomb strapped around his waist.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:52.336
How many did you guys see?
Three.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.798
She thinks there were three.
You were sitting in first class, right?

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.300
They said there were...
They saw three.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.886
No, they stabbed a first class passenger.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.096
Thank you.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.224
Did they answer?

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.725
- What did they say?
- They couldn't tell me anything.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.520
They didn't tell you anything at all?

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.270
It was just the maintenance department.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:15.234
I got through to United.
I got through on the maintenance line.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.946
I told them that the plane was hijacked.
I mean, I don't know what else to say.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.072
I don't know what to do.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.950
He didn't tell us anything!
He's a maintenance guy!

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.044
No, no, no! You back!
You back! You back!

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.968
- Okay.
- Sit! You!

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:46.765
Ziad!

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:56.108
- <i>...you heard that also?</i>
- <i>Yes, sir. Twice.</i>

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.778
<i>Roger. We heard that also.
Just wanted to confirm it wasn't from interference.</i>

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.281
- <i>Victor, 956.</i>
- <i>Victor, 956, go.</i>

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.576
<i>I wanted to answer your call.
We did hear that yelling, too.</i>

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.994
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.122
I think we're turning.

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:17.588
Wait. We're turning.
Are we turning?

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.048
- That means it's all right.
- It's okay...

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.676
We're gonna go back to the airport.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.387
- They're going to ask for ransom.
- What?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.471
I hope so.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.975
In 1977 in Mogadishu, they asked,
you know, for money.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.269
They will ask for ransom.
They will let us go.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.896
We're going back to the airport, all right?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.188
We're going back to the airport.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:37.065
They're trained to deal
with this situation. Okay?

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.360
And they'll get us down on the ground,
all right? Okay?

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.406
I'm a pilot. I've been flying all my life.
But it's... I just...

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.742
- What?
- Something's wrong here.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.161
We're okay.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.586
Anybody know where 77 is?

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.713
Cleveland Center was the last one
to talk to United 93.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.840
Cleveland Center is the last one
who spoke to United 93.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.425
But what about the military response on this?

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.136
I'm talking to them now.
I'm letting them know where we are with this.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.262
Listen, you got to get somebody...

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:08.597
Where are they when we need them?

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:09.932
down the hallway to talk to them.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.142
They are supposed to be liaisoning
with the military.

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:15.354
And I've got this colonel here,
he's not giving me the answers I need.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:18.190
We're giving you the best we can, sir.
The best information I've got.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.317
We're trying to get this CAP
established over New York.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.944
I don't give a shit about the CAP!

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.112
Listen to me.
I've got a board full of planes.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:27.908
American 77's missing!
United 93 another suspected hijack.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.576
Where are those fighter jets?
Are they...

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:32.955
You've got to get them into position
to do something about these aircraft.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.123
We've got Selfridge
on the command post right now.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.626
They've got two jets
that can fly from Alpena right now.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.920
Get them on frequency.
Hand them off to that. Copy that.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:41.672
What do you got, Foxy?
What do you got?

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:43.632
We got two F-16s out of Selfridge,

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:46.134
Chevy flight, airborne,
coming to our freq now.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.387
- They're unarmed, but that's all we've got.
- Copy that.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.472
We're gonna need more support
and I've got to know, sir.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.391
When they get there,
what can they do?

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.017
<i>...for a real world military mission.</i>

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:56.103
I understand it's a commercial airliner, sir.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.854
There will be casualties. But what...

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.773
Think about what happens
if they hit the ground.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:02.818
Think of what...
If they hit the Capitol, sir.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:04.778
Go ahead, MCC. Go ahead, go ahead.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.823
We got two F-16s coming out of Selfridge,
but they're unarmed.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.950
But how many more are out there?
That's the question.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.453
We've got a report of at least one more.
May we engage?

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.332
I think we shouldn't provoke them.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:18.583
Just do what they want.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.253
And then they'll land and let us go
and let the authorities...

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.379
Shouldn't somebody try to talk to them?

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:23.880
The police, they'll take care of them.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.007
Give them what they want.

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:27.009
Maybe we can negotiate with them.

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:48.280
Quiet.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.243
Just listen to me, sweetie,
I want you to call the authorities...

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.537
I'm calling from the Airfone.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.625
You believe me, don't you, Mom?

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.504
Did he stab him?

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:53.887
We got to go up there.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:01.103
Just take us back to the airport...

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:03.313
It's all right. It's just us.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.525
Let us see the passenger.
Just the passenger.

01:14:08.236 --> 01:14:09.986
Richard, it's Jeremy.

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:15.367
I'm on the plane.
Let me talk to Lyzzie.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.248
Okay... You.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.042
There's the passenger he stabbed.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.127
Okay. Okay.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.088
Okay. We're just checking the passenger.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:29.798
Did you contact the pilot?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.718
No, nobody said anything.
We can't get through to the cockpit.

01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:35.262
We can't get through.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.307
Okay, okay, okay.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.560
Sir, okay. Okay, sir.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:46.273
We're United flight 93. We've been hijacked.
There's three men with knives.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:50.193
One of them has a bomb
strapped around his waist.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.626
See if he has a pulse.
Is he breathing?

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:10.922
No, there's nothing. There's nothing.

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.177
Ahmed.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.188
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.190
- You've got to come back here.
- What is it?

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:29.900
- Come back here, come back here.
- What?

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:32.444
Oh, my God.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.280
Oh, my God.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.868
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.204
Stewardess, what's happening up there?
What is happening?

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.414
- This is awful. Listen...
- What is happening?

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:47.667
Just... We're going back to the airport.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.127
Call the pilot. Listen...

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:50.378
I don't know.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.464
We're just finding out
what we can find out.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.966
Get back here. Get back here.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.552
Listen, listen, listen.

01:15:57.637 --> 01:16:00.889
Listen! The pilots are on the ground.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:03.391
That was the pilots.
They're on the ground outside the cockpit.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.893
They're on the floor.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.228
She saw the pilot what?

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.897
What? What did she say?

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:12.150
The stewardess just said
the pilots aren't flying the plane.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:15.779
She saw two bodies
in front of the cockpit on the floor.

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:21.117
They said they saw the pilot
and the co-pilot on the floor.

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:22.494
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.292
<i>Flight United 93, call in.</i>

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:49.145
MCC? Cleveland is saying that Delta 1989
is considered a hijack.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.523
They're considering Delta 1989 a hijack.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:54.776
We got Delta 1989, suspected hijack,
heading west.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.028
Hit me up every track.
Did you copy that, sir?

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.531
- Two planes?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.866
This is a second plane, sir, coming in.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:06.538
We got the one going west out of Boston,
and American 11 coming into Washington.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.456
We still got the Selfridge planes, sir.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.542
Yes, sir. These guys are not armed.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.794
These fighters are not armed,
and we could ram...

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:16.381
If we ram them and eject, sir.
Do we have the authority, though?

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:21.052
Just spoke to Cleveland, they said that
US Air 2619 was headed towards Chicago.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.013
They've just evacuated the Sears Tower.

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:24.472
Jesus Christ!

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:26.808
United 93 is now reported as NORDO.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.728
No transponder, and now heading eastbound,
over Cleveland.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.313
Let me know what the hell is going on.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.189
Six miles southwest of the White House,

01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:35.525
Boston Center's tracking
a primary moving fast.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.277
Call Dulles tower.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:38.778
Give me this again.
Give me this again.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.823
Can you get me some verification on that?

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.075
Sir, we have a VFR aircraft

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.495
southwest of Washington,
headed straight in now.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.164
Sir, I got another flight
coming up south.

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.623
We have a plane headed
toward the Capitol.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.750
I got an unidentified plane...

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:54.836
Yes. I need to know about the ROE.
Can we engage?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.797
I want you to give me a 30-mile circle
around Reagan National.

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.216
Right now, you hit me up
every track on every aircraft.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.635
Do we have any communication
with the President at all?

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.012
<i>Where are the fighters?</i>

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.597
How long can that take?

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.015
Air Force One's taken off.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.726
They don't know anything about it.
They don't know where he's going.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.519
Ben, they're evacuating the White House!

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:12.854
All right, thanks, Carol.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:13.938
They're evacuating it right now.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.274
Hey, are we gonna get
an intercept on this, though?

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:17.442
Okay. Good!

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:20.070
Go get yourself out of your chair
and go down...

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:22.614
There's no coordination between
what NORAD has and what we have.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.407
You know where they're headed.

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:25.492
Just get the fighters up there!

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.912
How about the Vice President, sir?
Do we have a location on the Vice President?

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.581
Well, then the Vice President
can make the call.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:34.209
The Vice President can make the call.
We can engage.

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:35.502
Holy shit.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:39.381
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
What's the ETA on those Langley birds?

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.673
Foxy!

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.175
Spiders are airborne at 0930,

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:45.345
but they brought them out on an eastbound heading
rather than our northbound.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:47.263
We're gonna get them turned
as soon as possible.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.391
What the fuck? They're what?
They're heading east?

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:52.435
<i>What the hell is wrong out there?
Why are those planes off-course?</i>

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.106
It looks like they came out on a standard
scramble heading instead of the one I gave.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.066
We're trying to get clearance
to turn them now.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.442
How the fuck did they get out there?

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:00.693
I don't know, sir.

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:02.654
What the fuck are they doing out
over the water?

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.074
I don't care, God damn it, if they break windows,
you turn them back over land!

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:08.368
Roll quad sevens.
Turn them towards Washington now.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.328
Keep looking for him.
Keep looking for him.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:13.623
<i>It was a plane that crashed at the Pentagon.</i>

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.084
<i>And the Pentagon is being evacuated.</i>

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.587
<i>There is a large fire there,
and that is the smoke you see</i>

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.923
<i>in the shot that you are looking at now.</i>

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:25.009
<i>Whether that fire is
in the building itself or outside,</i>

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.429
<i>we have not yet confirmed.</i>

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:30.390
<i>There is a fire on the Mall in Washington.</i>

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:34.769
<i>The cause of the fire in the Mall in Washington,
we cannot yet tell you.</i>

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:36.062
Oh, my gosh!

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.272
- Foxy!
- Sir.

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:39.441
I want those Langley birds over Washington.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.776
<i>...that two planes have crashed
into the World Trade Center.</i>

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.070
Surveillance, I want you to hit up
tracks west of Cleveland...

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.448
- Get back into position.
- heading towards Las Vegas. Hit up.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.783
Light me up every track
you've got. Let's go.

01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:51.911
Let's go, let's go! Let's keep going here!
Let's keep working!

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.538
- ID, what do you got?
- All right,

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.249
he's off-course, he's deviated,
and we don't know why.

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:58.918
- Confirmed.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.295
Confirmed hijackings.

01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:03.506
That's the question.
What are we going to do now?

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:06.301
<i>There's a lot of confusion here
at the Pentagon. It appears that</i>

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:10.263
<i>something hit the Pentagon
on the outside of the fifth corridor,</i>

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.764
<i>on the Army corridor.</i>

01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:15.935
<i>Several Army officers I talked to
reported hearing a big explosion.</i>

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:18.480
Listen, I'm not taking any more chances.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.565
We got stuff flying around
we have no control over.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:24.152
And I don't want a board full of these planes
hitting every building on the East Coast.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:27.322
This is a national emergency.
Everyone lands, regardless of destination.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:28.615
That's gonna cost billions.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:29.699
Just do it!

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:31.493
We have hundreds of international flights
coming in.

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:32.911
They're already in the air.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.997
No. No, I don't want any more 
international flights crossing the borders.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.665
They'll have to go back
where they came from.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.417
Nobody's coming into the country
from now on.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:40.793
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:43.963
Shut off the East Coast.
Shut off all the internationals from Europe.

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:46.508
Shut off South America,
shut off the West Coast,

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:47.884
nothing over the top, either.

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:48.968
We're gonna call Canada on that?

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:50.053
Yeah, Canada, too.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.179
We're gonna shut down the airspace.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.472
No, I can't exempt anybody.

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:53.932
Nobody comes in, and nobody takes off.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.808
- Land them all.
- Take a moment. Think about this.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.852
We're gonna shut down
the entire country right now?

01:20:57.937 --> 01:21:00.438
That's right.
Listen, we're at war with someone,

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:03.858
and until we figure out what to do
about it, we're shutting down.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.485
That's it. We're finished.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.695
<i>...can handle the emergency situation.</i>

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.411
I don't know.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.747
I don't know what to do.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.084
Does anybody know about the pilot yet?

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.544
They don't know.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.295
No. They don't know.

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:27.840
What?

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:33.304
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.723
What?

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.935
In New York. The World Trade Center.
Two planes.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:43.940
My wife says that there was an explosion
at the World Trade Center.

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:45.400
What did he say?

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:49.404
Tell the stewardesses
two planes hit the World Trade Center.

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:51.573
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.
Tell the stewardesses.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:52.740
What about the five planes?

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:53.992
Someone pass that back.

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.243
Just a second. Right.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.538
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure you heard that right?

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:00.456
Two planes just hit
the World Trade Center.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.625
Two planes have crashed
into the World Trade Center.

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.836
What are they doing?
What are they doing?

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.297
Two planes just hit
the World Trade Center.

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:09.340
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:11.843
What did he say?

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.262
I don't know. I didn't hear.

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:16.097
It's on the news.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:17.890
It's on the news.
Yeah, it's on the news, yeah.

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.267
Where are you guys hearing this?

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.811
Somebody from up there said it.
Ask up there.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.606
Sandy, take her back, take her back.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:26.441
It's airplanes.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.525
They bombed the World Trade Center?

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.779
One after the other
hit the World Trade Center.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.198
Lyzzie, is it... It's planes.
It's not a bomb.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.950
It's two airplanes. It's not a bomb.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.619
- It's airplanes.
- What?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.412
It's one after the other.

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:42.540
One after the other
hit the World Trade Center.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.293
Airplanes, one after the other,
hit the World Trade Center.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.711
Where did this...
Who's hearing this?

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:47.879
Where did they come from?

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.255
He said it was on the news?

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.465
I'm on line with my wife.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.259
Are you hearing this?
What'd they say?

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:56.721
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.
Is that right?

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.724
Do they mean prop planes?

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.559
Whose planes? What airline?

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:03.102
Is it United?

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.522
Okay, sweetie, I will call you back,
I promise.

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:09.901
I just talked to my wife.
Two planes have hit the World Trade Center.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.695
There are five jets
that have been hijacked.

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.822
Are we one of them,
or are we the sixth?

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:16.574
Lyzzie, Lyzzie, Lyzzie.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.244
Lyzzie, not the Trade Center, right?
But the...

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:24.165
Into the Pentagon. It's on the news.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.043
- It's on the news, yeah.
- There was an...

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.506
There was an explosion at the Pentagon.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.341
Just tell them that.
That's all we know.

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:36.719
Hey, listen, there was
an explosion at the Pentagon.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:40.098
An explosion at the Pentagon.
Not a fire, an explosion.

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:49.691
<i>United 93, I understand
you have a bomb onboard. Go ahead.</i>

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.613
<i>Executive 956,
did you understand that transmission?</i>

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:59.242
<i>Affirmative.
He said there was a bomb onboard.</i>

01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:04.455
<i>Executive 956 turning 180.</i>

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.209
<i>Executive 956.</i>

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:10.294
<i>American 1060, do you see anybody
northwest of you?</i>

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:11.796
<i>Can you see back that far there?</i>

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.548
<i>Do you have a visual on him now?</i>

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:14.882
<i>Got him. We're looking now, sir.</i>

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.050
<i>United 93, Cleveland.</i>

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.971
<i>United 93, call in.</i>

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.806
<i>United 93, United...</i>

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.987
Put your seat belts on!

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.578
Oh, my God!

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.367
We're okay, we're okay.
No, we're okay.

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:27.413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:32.376
Hey, this is a suicide mission.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:36.130
We have to do something.
They are not gonna land this plane.

01:25:36.215 --> 01:25:37.965
They are not gonna take us
back to the airport.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.926
I don't think there's
any other option we have.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.385
If we're gonna die,
we're gonna die.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.346
They're flying us into a building.
We're gonna die.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:44.514
We should not interfere with them.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.808
There's a lot of us,
but we gotta do something.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.643
You see how low we are?

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:51.521
Is there a weapon?
Is there something we can use?

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:53.981
Go back. You go back.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:55.983
Stewardess, listen to me.
Are you listening?

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.109
I'm listening.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.946
Go back and you get everything you can...

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:04.158
You get every weapon you can.
Get whatever we can use as a weapon.

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:05.576
But what are we gonna do?

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.830
We don't... I... We'll figure that out,
but get every weapon we can.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.040
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.501
Okay. Okay.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:14.836
Go get it. Get everything you can.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.630
Okay, we need every big guy.
Every big guy.

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:21.509
Every big guy. Luggage. Luggage.
We need weapons.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.804
Get back here. Get back here.
Get back here. Okay.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.848
We need to boil water.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.224
For what? We gotta get water?

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:29.851
We gotta get weapons.

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:32.687
Promise me that Emmy

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:35.106
is going to know

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.652
that I just love her very much.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.196
What else can we use? What else?

01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:44.699
- Wine bottles.
- Forks, knives.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.952
The guy that I was sitting in front of
said that he doesn't think the bomb is real.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.120
That's all I know.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.538
He's on his way back.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:01.215
Come up with a plan,
I'm gonna calm the other passengers

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.802
and we'll go along with
whatever plan you come up with.

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:06.679
You've gotta...

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:07.763
Sit down. Sit down!

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.473
Oh, God.

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:11.392
So, what do we do?
What do you have?

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.227
We got the forks, knives, hot water...

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:14.437
Hot water...

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:15.897
Yeah, I gave him the fire extinguisher.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:16.939
Just let them go.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:19.066
- Hey! Sit! Sit!
- Just let them go. Just let them go.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:20.192
Hey, come on.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:25.489
Okay.

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:27.658
They have a bomb!

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:33.289
Do you really think he'd get
a bomb onboard this plane?

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.666
Yeah, that guy in front of you
said he didn't think it was real.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.251
I know. That's what I think, too.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.879
How does he get a bomb
onboard this plane?

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.843
Jack, are you there?

01:27:48.805 --> 01:27:50.431
Wake up, sweetie.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.686
Okay.

01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:58.898
I just want to tell you I love you.

01:27:58.982 --> 01:28:00.942
We're going back to the airport.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:05.196
I love you.
I gotta give the phone to Linda now.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.700
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:18.626
I just love you more than anything.
Know that.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.127
I, well...

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.800
Please tell my family I love them, too.
Bye, honey.

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:30.221
Please give my love to Mom and Dad.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:32.848
And I really, really love you.

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:35.309
My safe is in the bedroom in the closet.

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:38.646
The combination is 302 and 0913

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:42.108
and it should open.
My will is inside.

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:15.516
I'm trained in hand-to-hand,
I'm trained in judo. So...

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.643
Okay. So we go up right behind you.

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:18.686
We have to go very fast.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:19.770
Okay. Absolutely.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:23.024
And I'm gonna... I don't give a fuck
if that thing is real or not.

01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:26.944
I'm going to get his arm,
I'm gonna get his arm and I'm gonna break his arm.

01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:30.031
We need a plan. We need a plan.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:31.699
We're gonna do something.

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:32.825
Ahmed. Ahmed!

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.535
What is he doing? Oh, my God.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:35.911
Hey, no talk!

01:29:35.996 --> 01:29:36.996
So what...

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:39.957
Hey! You!

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.877
What is it? What?

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.545
- Stop!
- Somebody else?

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.466
- Okay! Okay! Okay!
- Oh, my God.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:51.010
Okay.

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:53.179
Just stay calm. Just stay calm.

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:55.139
You guys are all right?

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:57.933
Sit! Sit!

01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.810
Hey, sit! Sit!

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:04.315
Oh, my God!

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:06.233
Get your seat belts on!

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:10.654
You're not supposed to be able to see
the ground that low, are you?

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:12.615
No, and not this fast!

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:15.201
Hello? 911?

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:16.994
911.

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:19.830
Yes, hijacking in progress.

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:24.293
I'm in the bathroom.
United flight 93.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:27.338
Yeah, I love you, too, Fred.

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:30.382
Goodbye.

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.140
You call your people.

01:30:38.225 --> 01:30:39.683
- Oh, Christ, it's not real.
- I understand.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:41.268
It's not real,
so I can handle it myself.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:42.937
Go for the detonator first.

01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:46.941
How do we get into the cockpit door?

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:48.067
Breakaway panels.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.276
Just take him down.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:50.361
You go after me...

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:51.987
- Absolutely.
- but you go fast. Listen.

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:54.949
I'm listening! But we need to know
who's gonna fucking fly the plane!

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.700
- Go for his throat!
- What?

01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:58.285
He said he could fly!

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.162
- He said he can fly!
- He can fly a plane.

01:31:00.247 --> 01:31:01.539
Listen, I think we might have a pilot.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.290
They said there's a pilot onboard!

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:05.626
- We got a pilot.
- What? Who? Who?

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:08.045
- Which one?
- This guy right here.

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:10.548
Down there. Third row.

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.466
- On the right.
- Third row, third row.

01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:14.718
Okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:16.846
- You were a pilot?
- Yeah.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.931
I mean, a single engine,
I mean, you know?

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:20.641
Right. Right, right.
You can fly this plane?

01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:23.185
- I don't know. I mean, I'll try.
- Okay.

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.979
'Cause we're gonna get you up there.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:27.815
I understand. That's why
we've gotta do something right now.

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:29.483
- You got a plan?
- Come on!

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:31.527
Now, we're gonna take you up
to the front of the plane.

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:33.904
- You can come up behind us.
- Okay. If you can get me in there,

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.824
I think I might be able to land it,
but I need a lot of help from the ground.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.618
I can talk you down. I can talk you down.
I did eight years ATC.

01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:41.370
- Okay.
- You did? Listen.

01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:43.914
When you get me in there,
you've gotta get ahold of the controls,

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.625
because if he does anything sudden,
we don't have enough room,

01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:50.421
to pull out of it. Okay?
You gotta get him off the controls.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:53.257
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.426
Okay, there's a pilot.
We've got to get the pilot.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:58.179
We have to do something, right?
I mean, he's all over the place.

01:31:58.263 --> 01:31:59.388
I understand.

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:00.514
We are alone up here.

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:03.934
Nobody is going to help us.
We've got to do it. Okay?

01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:15.821
Who is the pilot?

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:16.989
I don't know.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:19.742
Hi, Mom, it's me.

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:24.872
I'm on the plane that's been hijacked.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.792
I'm just calling to tell you

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.671
that I love you, and goodbye.

01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:39.261
This really kind woman handed me the phone
and she said to call you.

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:44.683
If I don't make it out of this alive,
will you please promise that you'll call my family?

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.562
Thank you.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:53.025
Just tell them I love them.

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:57.446
Tell my wife and my boys
that I love them.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:01.825
Here, take these. There's more.
Pass these along. Here.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.373
Who is the fucking pilot?

01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:08.874
In the brown shirt.

01:33:08.959 --> 01:33:12.878
Phil, Phil, it's me.
I've been on a plane that's been hijacked.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.759
Listen, a bunch of the guys
have got together

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:22.304
and they said that we're gonna, like,
try and take over the plane.

01:33:22.389 --> 01:33:26.558
But, baby, I promise you,
if I get out of this, I'm quitting tomorrow.

01:33:26.643 --> 01:33:28.852
I'll quit tomorrow. I promise,
I'll quit tomorrow.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:31.522
And tell my babies I love them.

01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:58.882
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.343
hallowed be Thy name.

01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:03.053
Thy kingdom come,

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.806
Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.976
And forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.613
I don't want to be here.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.783
Baby, I don't want to be here. Baby...

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:31.498
We're gonna break into the cockpit,
and we're gonna fly it.

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:33.500
No, it's gonna be okay.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:42.509
I love you, too.

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:45.637
You guys, come on, let's go, let's go.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:53.729
Come on, guys, what are we waiting for?
Let's roll. Come on. Let's go already.

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:55.814
No messing around, boys.

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:57.232
We got no choice, no choice, no choice.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:58.567
Oh, Jesus, let's go.

01:34:58.651 --> 01:34:59.902
Get yourself going. Come on.

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:12.289
Hey!

01:35:18.922 --> 01:35:20.130
Go!

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:29.598
Get the bomb! Get the bomb!

01:35:29.682 --> 01:35:31.058
Saeed! Ziad!

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.107
Get the bomb! Get the bomb!

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:50.285
Get his thumb off the trigger!
Get his hand, get his hand!

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:51.829
Get the bomb!

01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:05.676
I got it! I got it!

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:08.679
It's a fake! It's a fake!

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:12.891
The bomb's a fake! It's a fake!

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:05.569
Forward!

01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:34.681
Look out!

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:43.440
Son of a bitch! Come here, you!

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.442
God damn it!

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:08.715
Go, go, go!

01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:27.776
No!

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:40.247
Get the knife! Get the knife!
Grab his hand!

01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:41.832
Get it!

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:47.963
Get the pilot!

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:52.426
No! No! Come on!

01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:56.179
Get him up! Get him up!
Come on, come on, you can do it.

01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:07.232
Bring it up here!

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:09.067
Move it!

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:15.198
Move it! Come on, move it!

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:25.334
Shit.

01:39:25.418 --> 01:39:28.128
If we don't get in there,
we'll all die!

01:39:33.343 --> 01:39:34.384
Ziad!

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.140
Move it!

01:39:42.644 --> 01:39:44.853
Bring the pilot up!

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:54.321
Get him up! Grab his hands!
Grab his hands!

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:56.698
Pull it up!

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:24.226
I can't pull! I can't!

01:40:25.305 --> 01:40:31.442
