MADLY IN LOVE.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.891
AND THEN HE SUDDENLY
DUMPED ME FOR THIS
OTHER GIRL.

38:42.891 --> 38:44.793
TOTALLY BROKE MY HEART.

38:44.793 --> 38:47.926
SO I--WELL, I DIDN'T
TAKE IT VERY WELL.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.928
YEAH, I GOT
THIS GIANT KNIFE

38:49.928 --> 38:51.560
AND I WENT
TO THIS GIRL'S HOUSE

38:51.560 --> 38:53.061
AND WAS GONNA FIND HER,
BUT SHE WASN'T THERE,

38:53.061 --> 38:55.964
SO I JUST
SLASHED HER TIRES.

38:55.964 --> 38:57.736
BUT I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THERAPY,

38:57.736 --> 39:00.809
AND I HAVE FOUND A WAY
TO CONTROL MY EMOTIONS,
PRETTY MUCH.

39:00.809 --> 39:05.844
SO ANYWAY, HOPE THAT
LETS YOU KNOW A LITTLE
BIT MORE ABOUT ME.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.845
AND ONE OF THESE DAYS,

39:06.845 --> 39:10.949
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR
ONE OF YOUR STORIES.

39:16.925 --> 39:19.127
THERE YOU GO.

39:19.127 --> 39:22.691
HEY, BIG SHOT.

39:22.691 --> 39:23.662
HEY.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.094
THAT'S YOU,
MR. BIG SHOT.

39:26.094 --> 39:28.897
FEELIN' PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF, HUH?

39:28.897 --> 39:30.469
YOU REALLY PUT ONE
OVER ON ME.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.941
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:32.941 --> 39:34.443
OH, RYAN'S SOUL.

39:34.443 --> 39:36.144
I HAD IT ALL
LINED UP.

39:36.144 --> 39:37.005
PRIMED TO TAKE IT,

39:37.005 --> 39:39.948
THEN YOU STOLE IT
RIGHT OUT FROM
UNDER ME.

39:39.948 --> 39:41.980
YOU BEAT ME
TO THE PUNCH.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.454
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU,
SAMMY. BIG TIME.

39:45.454 --> 39:48.917
YOU'RE QUITE
THE SLY FOX.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.520
OH, COME ON.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.092
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO GLOAT ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

39:54.092 --> 39:58.427
ADMIT IT.
I WON'T BE MAD.

40:00.969 --> 40:03.171
YEAH, IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD.
OH.

40:03.171 --> 40:04.633
SEND AN EVIL SOUL TO HELL,

40:04.633 --> 40:06.935
SAVE A GOOD SOUL
FROM BEING DAMNED,
I LIKE IT.

40:06.935 --> 40:08.637
YEAH, THERE YOU GO, SEE?

40:08.637 --> 40:10.979
PLUS, YOU GOT
THE BEST OF ME.

40:10.979 --> 40:14.843
NOW, DON'T TELL ME
THAT DOESN'T
GIVE YOU A RUSH.

40:14.843 --> 40:16.585
YEAH, IT DOES.

40:16.585 --> 40:17.045
[CHUCKLES]

40:17.045 --> 40:18.847
I GUESS YOU CAN'T
WIN 'EM ALL.

40:18.847 --> 40:22.951
OH, YEAH.
I GUESS NOT.

40:28.196 --> 40:31.530
[CREAKING]

40:53.081 --> 40:55.053
YOU SAID
YOU WOULDN'T BE MAD!

40:55.053 --> 40:57.526
NO, THIS ISN'T ME
MAD, SAM.

40:57.526 --> 40:59.528
THIS IS ME DISAPPOINTED.

40:59.528 --> 41:01.590
HMM.

41:01.990 --> 41:05.694
YOU SHOULD SEE ME
WHEN I'M MAD.

41:05.694 --> 41:08.767
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING.
