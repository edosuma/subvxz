09:16.370 --> 09:18.210
I've got a bit of
news that might cheer you up.

09:19.474 --> 09:20.910
Best thing I've had in
a long while.

09:22.978 --> 09:26.281
I've got an informant
who runs a pub

09:26.314 --> 09:27.950
and there's a dealer
who goes in here,

09:28.149 --> 09:30.952
serves him a bit of
knocked off booze and that.

09:31.652 --> 09:33.989
And he says he was
involved in a job

09:34.622 --> 09:37.693
and him and his little crew
got off with it Scott free.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.360
Five years ago.

09:41.196 --> 09:42.196
In Whitfield.

09:45.266 --> 09:48.236
Every Thursday about three-ish
he swings by the pub,

09:48.268 --> 09:50.371
does his little bit of
business, he's got a Van.

09:52.206 --> 09:55.109
Only problem is, he's
got moody number plates

09:55.143 --> 09:56.503
so I couldn't get his
home address.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.114
Where's the pub?

10:02.783 --> 10:04.585
Harry, I'm gonna be
honest with you mate,

10:04.619 --> 10:05.387
you don't look up to it.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.420
Where's the pub?

10:26.041 --> 10:27.041
Cheers, mo.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.647
God bless ya.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.752
Thank you.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.700
What can I get ya?

11:31.439 --> 11:32.508
A lager pint.

12:39.606 --> 12:40.606
We disagree.

12:40.774 --> 12:43.811
That's the main thing, it
means more money, a grand.

12:43.845 --> 12:44.778
Like to sort it out.

12:44.811 --> 12:46.413
Got to shift it, haven't I, so..

12:46.446 --> 12:48.517
Yeah and keep
it discrete, you know?

12:49.484 --> 12:50.644
They're putting the pressure.

12:50.851 --> 12:52.186
If he finds out you're doing it

12:52.220 --> 12:53.589
and they get to us through you.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.661
Go, drive!

12:59.860 --> 13:01.263
Fucking go!

13:01.528 --> 13:02.563
Come on!

13:02.864 --> 13:04.499
Drive the fucking car.

13:04.532 --> 13:05.533
Come on!

13:05.734 --> 13:07.168
- Fucking drive!
- Go!

14:27.648 --> 14:28.648
Come on!

14:29.950 --> 14:31.820
Go, fucking go!

16:26.734 --> 16:28.704
Probably gonna go cry somewhere.

16:29.271 --> 16:31.373
He's going to start crying.

16:31.406 --> 16:34.609
Come on, bring him back here
and cut his fucking cock off.

16:34.642 --> 16:37.112
Bring him back in, I
ain't joking.

16:37.144 --> 16:38.479
Why?

16:38.513 --> 16:39.547
What'd ya think?

16:40.580 --> 16:41.580
What's so difficult?

16:41.816 --> 16:43.096
Yeah what's the problem with it?

16:46.620 --> 16:47.588
You're going to shoot him.

16:47.622 --> 16:50.125
Both of them, in the
head, on the roof, now.

16:50.157 --> 16:51.157
Come on.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.431
If you don't shoot him,

16:56.464 --> 16:58.600
I'll stab you in the
fucking face!

16:58.999 --> 17:01.869
All right?

17:01.902 --> 17:03.437
Gotta get him from the basement.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.773
Get on the roof now.

17:04.805 --> 17:05.873
They need to be dead.

17:16.783 --> 17:18.486
Come on, go, go!

17:18.753 --> 17:20.088
Come on, go!

17:24.591 --> 17:27.528
Come on, get in the fucking car!

17:47.514 --> 17:49.184
This is my fucking house.

17:50.818 --> 17:53.555
When they've all came to my
fucking manor.

17:53.987 --> 17:56.424
Hold the gun up, and point it
in their fucking heads.

18:07.033 --> 18:10.604
Show what happens when they
walk into my fucking house.

18:13.107 --> 18:14.108
You two on your knees.

18:14.140 --> 18:15.140
You an all.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.146
I said on your knees.

18:22.949 --> 18:23.949
Do it!

18:27.021 --> 18:28.156
I said fucking do it!

18:28.789 --> 18:29.456
Do it!

18:29.790 --> 18:32.060
Fucking do it or I'll
stab you right now.

18:32.359 --> 18:33.829
Fucking do it!

18:37.697 --> 18:39.833
Or I'll stab you if you
don't fucking do it!

18:39.867 --> 18:40.867
Now!

26:59.299 --> 27:00.544
Your mates, where
have they gone?

27:00.568 --> 27:01.669
Where are they?

27:02.770 --> 27:03.770
The countryside.

27:06.773 --> 27:07.773
Why?

27:07.940 --> 27:10.644
Picking up a delivery.

27:12.178 --> 27:13.178
Drugs?

27:15.782 --> 27:16.782
When?

27:17.317 --> 27:18.653
A couple of days.

27:26.827 --> 27:27.827
Write it down.

27:27.962 --> 27:29.464
Come on, come on!

27:30.430 --> 27:31.498
Write down the address.

27:43.310 --> 27:44.310
That's my pen.

27:51.752 --> 27:52.752
Sorry.

27:57.491 --> 27:58.491
Who are you?

28:10.369 --> 28:11.371
They were my life.

28:15.509 --> 28:17.812
I knew I'd see you again.

28:19.178 --> 28:21.581
I waited, I hoped, I prayed,

28:21.881 --> 28:23.450
I would see you all again.

28:25.218 --> 28:26.286
I need a doctor.

28:34.695 --> 28:35.696
What's with the gun?

28:36.362 --> 28:37.362
Don't get up.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
Doesn't suit ya.

28:43.536 --> 28:44.536
Please don't get up.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.156
We're going to find ya,
we're going to kill ya.

29:06.660 --> 29:08.562
Just like we killed
those two bitches!

31:13.387 --> 31:14.989
- Oh.
- Sorry.

31:16.990 --> 31:18.993
I'm, I'm really hungry.

31:19.525 --> 31:20.695
Don't worry about it.

31:23.664 --> 31:24.831
I've got the munchies too.

31:31.738 --> 31:33.006
That's beautiful.

31:34.975 --> 31:36.310
Looks really peaceful.

31:38.078 --> 31:39.480
I used to go there
with my husband.

31:41.447 --> 31:42.649
Well when he was alive.

31:43.117 --> 31:45.953
It's supposed to be sunny there
tomorrow, according to my phone.

31:46.887 --> 31:47.955
Was he a good husband?

31:50.991 --> 31:51.991
Yeah.

31:55.361 --> 31:56.363
He was funny too.

32:00.867 --> 32:02.403
I'm going to heat this up.

32:45.044 --> 32:46.479
I'm so sorry.

32:47.046 --> 32:48.081
I'm so sorry.

33:09.569 --> 33:10.569
It's for your throat.

33:17.910 --> 33:20.447
You know yesterday, we...

33:22.115 --> 33:23.884
We'd have continued
that I don't...

33:23.917 --> 33:25.119
I understand.

33:27.154 --> 33:28.989
- Good book?
- Yeah.

33:29.321 --> 33:31.024
"The count of monte cristo."

33:31.992 --> 33:33.394
It was a present from my wife.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.528
Are you still married?

33:36.530 --> 33:37.530
We're separated.

33:38.665 --> 33:43.503
"It is necessary to have
wished for death in order

33:43.536 --> 33:45.939
to know how good it is to live."

33:46.205 --> 33:48.609
The French, they have a
way with words, don't they?

33:49.743 --> 33:50.743
And food.

33:50.977 --> 33:52.417
Do you know what they
call an orgasm?

33:54.947 --> 33:56.649
La petit morte.

33:59.653 --> 34:00.755
It means small death.

34:02.923 --> 34:03.958
Can I ask you something?

34:05.524 --> 34:06.524
Yeah, of course.

34:07.660 --> 34:08.895
I need to take tomorrow off.

34:11.697 --> 34:12.697
Yeah, okay.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.295
No!

40:42.288 --> 40:43.023
Run.

40:43.056 --> 40:43.857
Fucking run!

40:43.889 --> 40:44.889
Hurry up!

40:47.527 --> 40:49.862
Fuck you, fuck, fuck!

44:58.877 --> 45:00.746
That's $4.99 please.

45:36.616 --> 45:37.616
Haven't taken the pills.

45:45.324 --> 45:46.324
What the fuck is this?

45:50.196 --> 45:51.197
Where is he?

45:56.868 --> 45:57.868
You're lucky.

45:59.304 --> 46:00.304
Yeah.

46:02.808 --> 46:06.246
Give yourself a shot
every four hours.

46:09.181 --> 46:12.284
For the pain, very
strong opiates.

46:13.185 --> 46:14.185
Careful with them.

46:14.621 --> 46:15.655
No more than three a day.

46:39.744 --> 46:40.744
No answer.

47:32.797 --> 47:33.797
Check next door.

47:58.290 --> 47:59.558
That fat cunt took my knife.

48:00.826 --> 48:01.826
I want it back.

48:03.763 --> 48:06.232
You grab his legs and
mind the blood.

48:32.023 --> 48:33.326
You okay?

48:33.359 --> 48:34.994
Yeah, I've twisted my shoulder.

48:36.795 --> 48:38.031
Ahh, thank you.

48:44.837 --> 48:45.837
How was your day off?

48:46.672 --> 48:47.706
Get a lot done?

48:49.607 --> 48:50.607
Yeah.

49:14.366 --> 49:15.366
Hey.

49:16.768 --> 49:18.504
So, you'll close up, yeah?

49:21.741 --> 49:23.541
We're going to be closed
for a couple of days.

49:25.043 --> 49:26.478
Oh, guess you know that.

49:27.645 --> 49:29.481
Yeah, well, obviously
you know that.

49:31.616 --> 49:32.651
I can't speak properly.

49:32.685 --> 49:33.920
Um.

49:35.721 --> 49:36.755
I'm going to the seaside.

49:38.590 --> 49:40.060
I rented myself a little place.

49:42.161 --> 49:43.161
It's my birthday.

49:45.531 --> 49:46.531
I'm getting old.

49:47.065 --> 49:48.667
It's better than the
alternative.

49:49.735 --> 49:50.735
Oh.

49:51.103 --> 49:52.906
Yeah, well.

49:54.072 --> 49:56.875
If you wanted
to come visit, stay,

50:00.679 --> 50:01.380
it's um,

50:01.413 --> 50:04.016
it's the address and the phone.

50:08.453 --> 50:09.589
It'll be nice to see you.

50:13.759 --> 50:14.961
Happy birthday, Emma.

50:44.723 --> 50:45.723
Hello, Harry.

50:48.993 --> 50:50.696
You'd been better
forgetting about us.

50:53.031 --> 50:57.503
Well, you think you
can just walk away, huh?

51:00.005 --> 51:01.474
Where's my knife?

51:06.612 --> 51:07.647
Where's my knife?

51:08.581 --> 51:09.581
Eh?

51:11.284 --> 51:13.119
Where's my fucking knife?

51:37.643 --> 51:38.778
There shoot him!

51:41.647 --> 51:42.647
Shoot him!

51:45.518 --> 51:47.554
There, shoot him!

52:04.203 --> 52:06.239
Hold him, fucking hold
him straight! Hold him!

52:54.652 --> 52:55.652
Fucking bit me.

53:38.063 --> 53:40.266
This is the
Henderson detective agency.

53:40.465 --> 53:42.768
Please leave a message
after the tone.

53:45.871 --> 53:46.940
Fuck!

53:50.009 --> 53:52.211
This is the
Henderson detective agency.

53:52.610 --> 53:54.781
Please leave a message
after the tone.

54:19.203 --> 54:21.975
Stockers farm, ricksmansworth.

54:33.819 --> 54:34.819
He's fucking lying.

54:38.190 --> 54:39.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:01.339 --> 56:02.741
Fucking snitch.

57:10.909 --> 57:11.909
Here he is.

57:17.315 --> 57:18.317
What you doing?

57:21.420 --> 57:22.522
Here, here. Sit.

57:31.096 --> 57:32.231
You want some biscuits?

57:32.531 --> 57:33.811
I think I've got some in the ca.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.536
What happened to you?

57:39.971 --> 57:41.506
I suggest you go to a hospital.

57:41.940 --> 57:42.975
I'm just a vet.

57:45.409 --> 57:46.409
How are my horses?

57:48.145 --> 57:49.481
They only stable five now.

57:51.049 --> 57:54.020
Between here and the practice,
I just couldn't keep up.

57:54.286 --> 57:55.286
Sorry.

57:56.654 --> 57:57.956
Everyone asks about you.

58:01.226 --> 58:02.226
Where have you been?

58:03.462 --> 58:04.563
All these years.

58:07.498 --> 58:08.533
I've found them.

58:10.402 --> 58:11.503
All of them.

58:13.605 --> 58:16.007
I need you to leave me
alone for a few days.

58:17.109 --> 58:18.610
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

58:19.444 --> 58:20.846
Don't come and see me.

59:36.121 --> 59:37.201
You're sure they're coming?

59:38.389 --> 59:39.509
I just killed three of them.

59:46.565 --> 59:48.935
We used to walk around
here when she was pregnant.

59:52.270 --> 59:53.505
You must get ready.

59:54.672 --> 59:55.672
I'm scared.

1:00:08.453 --> 1:00:09.455
Take it.

1:03:11.302 --> 1:03:12.371
Where is he?

1:03:12.670 --> 1:03:13.705
Come on!

1:03:41.766 --> 1:03:42.835
Where the fuck is he?

1:03:43.935 --> 1:03:45.270
Check upstairs.

1:04:34.819 --> 1:04:35.987
Waste of time. He's not here.

1:04:39.657 --> 1:04:40.657
Stay here.

1:09:58.910 --> 1:09:59.910
It's over.

1:10:03.213 --> 1:10:04.213
It's not.

1:10:05.950 --> 1:10:06.950
Go home.
