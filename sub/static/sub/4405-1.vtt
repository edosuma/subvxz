05:36.378 --> 05:37.425
Move!

08:21.918 --> 08:23.438
It's life or death now, James.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.883
By that,
I mean you're doing one or the other

08:29.467 --> 08:31.140
up in Rockview.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.602
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.059
Want to know what he's wondering?

08:38.768 --> 08:41.486
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy

08:41.604 --> 08:43.322
on your way to the death house.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.825
See, the D.A. likes the needle,

08:46.151 --> 08:47.903
whereas me,

08:47.986 --> 08:50.830
I like to see a man like you
live a long life

08:51.156 --> 08:52.829
with all your teeth knocked out.

08:53.158 --> 08:57.004
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your fart from a yawn.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.342
Now, I don't know
what kind of man you are,

08:59.414 --> 09:01.166
which of these two fates you prefer,

09:01.291 --> 09:05.842
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.

09:06.504 --> 09:11.180
If you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,

09:11.468 --> 09:15.644
waive your right to counsel and confess,
right now.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.322
Sixteen hours.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.866
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.540
What the hell is this?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.553
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.885
<i>Jack Reacher,</i>

09:54.052 --> 09:58.398
born Jack, not John, no middle name,
is a ghost.

09:58.723 --> 10:03.024
No driver's license, current or expired.
No residence, current or former.

10:03.228 --> 10:08.234
No credit cards, no credit history.
No P.O. box, cell phone, e-mail.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.908
Nothing.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.528
Can you at least tell me who he is?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.740
Well, I can tell you who he was.
Blood military.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.037
<i>Born and raised on bases abroad.</i>

10:17.575 --> 10:20.078
<i>Mother was a French national,
father in the Corps.</i>

10:20.370 --> 10:23.715
<i>His first trip to the United States
was to attend West Point.</i>

10:23.832 --> 10:25.709
<i>Four years later, he ships out for good.</i>

10:26.209 --> 10:29.679
<i>Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans.
You name it.</i>

10:29.921 --> 10:32.094
<i>Served with distinction.</i>

10:32.257 --> 10:35.431
<i>Silver Star, Bronze Star,
Legion of Merit.</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:40.398
Defence Superior Service Medal?
Had to look that one up.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.021
And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service

10:43.226 --> 10:47.231
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.778
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.451
<i>Demoted to Captain.</i>

10:51.776 --> 10:53.198
<i>Worked his way back to Major.</i>

10:53.945 --> 10:56.619
<i>Then two years ago, he musters out.</i>

10:56.948 --> 11:01.954
<i>After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,</i>

11:02.120 --> 11:04.122
for only the second time in his life,

11:04.247 --> 11:08.093
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.877
<i>Dead, maybe?</i>

11:09.961 --> 11:11.562
<i>Not according
to Social Security</i>

11:11.629 --> 11:13.552
<i>and a bank account in Virginia.</i>

11:13.756 --> 11:15.929
<i>His pension is deposited monthly</i>

11:16.050 --> 11:20.226
<i>and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.</i>

11:21.222 --> 11:23.896
<i>I can't find out where
without a federal warrant.</i>

11:24.726 --> 11:26.444
<i>Well, he can't drive or fly.</i>

11:26.644 --> 11:27.987
<i>At least not under his real name.</i>

11:29.606 --> 11:31.734
<i>- Any warrants?</i>
<i>- Records clean.</i>

11:31.941 --> 11:35.286
Oh, come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.913
His record is clean.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.952
So.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.584
How do we find this Reacher?

11:44.913 --> 11:48.167
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.588
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher here to see you.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.147
Can I help you?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.642
James Barr.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.781
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.329
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.575
That was an oversight.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.002
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.954
Just as likely.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.122
But it's done and we can't undo it.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.378
So what happens now?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.797
Well, now he's in a coma.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.631
We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.386
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.801
Why did he call you as a witness?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.477
I don't believe he did.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.279
Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.908
Any chance I could look
at the evidence?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.608
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.936
Nice meeting you.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.361
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- Mr Reacher.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.988
- Mr Reacher!
- Hey, stop! Stop right there!

12:52.063 --> 12:53.440
We had a deal.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.776
I take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.611
I know you say he shot five people,
I know he's in a coma.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.821
I know there's a bus station
three miles away

12:59.988 --> 13:01.740
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.207
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.953
- He's not my friend.
- Why'd he ask for you, then?

13:06.035 --> 13:09.039
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.210
Hey. Hold on.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.545
Don't do that.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.335
Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.510
Uh-oh.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.304
You do not talk to my client
without me present.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.426
You know that.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.676
We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.261
- You're Barr's attorney?
- Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.180
- Jack Reacher?
- Helen Rodin.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.893
Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.016
It's a good story, actually.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.225
I'd like to hear it.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.436
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?

13:31.561 --> 13:34.064
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.029
- It's not what it looks like.
- He came to us.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.777
- You went to the D.A.?
- Is there a law against that?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.286
None you're currently breaking.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.451
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.870
Say, "See you in court." For me.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.538
Good bye, Detective.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.541
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.962
Let's go.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.046
So...

13:57.211 --> 13:58.554
So, you're Jack Reacher.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.383
- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.309
- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.792
- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.924
You don't want to depose me.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.097
Oh, well, you're my only
defence witness.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.896
- I'm not a defence witness.
- Your friend James thinks you are.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.477
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?

14:12.602 --> 14:13.603
Well, why else would he ask for you

14:13.728 --> 14:14.729
and why would you
come here to help him?

14:14.812 --> 14:18.237
I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.850
Linsky.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.805
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.281
- So why are you so hard to find?
- I'm impossible to find.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.477
Why is that?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.985
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.150
Are you on the run?

15:02.527 --> 15:04.700
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counsellor.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.902
How do you know James Barr?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.615
- Why are you representing him?
- I'm a lawyer.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.339
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.790
I'm not trying to clear him,

15:11.869 --> 15:14.338
I am just trying
to keep him off death row.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.883
- By proving he's insane?
- Well, that's one option.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.628
And sticking it to your father because...

15:19.710 --> 15:22.179
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.977
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.720
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.354
Impeccable tailoring.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.315
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.064
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.811
Confess or face death.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.231
Against a D.A. who never loses.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.482
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

15:41.566 --> 15:43.068
has gone down without a fight.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.153
Oh, I get it.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.329
You're an idealist.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.665
No. I'm a pacifist.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.250
It's a noble crusade.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.247
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.211
You haven't even seen the evidence.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.262
Is this a privileged conversation?

16:03.379 --> 16:07.100
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.854
There are four types of people
who join the military.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.727
For some, it's a family trade.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.567
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.895
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.404
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.743
James Barr was one of those.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.071
<i>He made sniper.</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:31.408
<i>Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

16:31.866 --> 16:33.834
<i>And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise</i>

16:33.910 --> 16:36.538
<i>the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.</i>

16:36.746 --> 16:39.590
<i>The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.</i>

16:40.750 --> 16:43.253
<i>Visualise that puff of pink mist.</i>

16:45.087 --> 16:46.930
<i>Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:48.929
<i>He's put on overwatch.</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:52.429
<i>All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.</i>

16:53.095 --> 16:54.267
<i>Women.</i>

16:54.597 --> 16:55.644
<i>Children.</i>

16:56.098 --> 16:58.772
Day in, day out, for two long years

16:58.893 --> 17:01.897
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.781
Then comes the drawdown.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.402
For James Barr, the war's over.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.287
<i>Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

17:10.613 --> 17:14.242
<i>A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.</i>

17:15.117 --> 17:17.619
<i>You've been hungry.
You've been horny.</i>

17:17.954 --> 17:20.298
<i>You've had an itch you can't scratch.</i>

17:20.790 --> 17:24.795
<i>Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.</i>

17:25.127 --> 17:29.132
<i>Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.</i>

17:29.465 --> 17:33.345
<i>Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:35.437
<i>and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,</i>

17:35.513 --> 17:37.140
<i>you never will.</i>

17:37.473 --> 17:39.146
<i>You need a release.</i>

17:39.809 --> 17:41.311
<i>You need a target.</i>

17:41.644 --> 17:44.614
<i>And the who of it
never once enters your mind.</i>

18:01.831 --> 18:03.833
<i>He covered his tracks well,</i>

18:03.958 --> 18:05.631
just like sane people do.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.886
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.725
So why didn't he go to prison?

18:13.801 --> 18:17.180
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

18:17.305 --> 18:20.559
<i>just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.</i>

18:21.142 --> 18:24.737
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.820
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.990
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.665
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

18:35.990 --> 18:39.335
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.331
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.758
This is classified information.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.841
And that's why the privilege.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.172
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.226
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.184
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.067
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.686
You still haven't seen the evidence.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.741
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.406
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.369
He might.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.241
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.125
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.961
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.758
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.088
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

19:31.921 --> 19:36.392
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

19:36.467 --> 19:38.561
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.273
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.435
He didn't confess this time.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.924
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.198
I want to know why.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.322
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.990
And you can't ask Barr,

19:56.112 --> 19:58.456
and the D.A. won't let you
see the evidence.

19:59.949 --> 20:04.455
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.504
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.011
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.869
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.747
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

21:21.864 --> 21:25.368
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.337
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.381
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.886
I'll do it. On one condition.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.891
Name it.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.396
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.400
How do you suggest I do that?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.735
- Yes?
- Mr Farrior?

21:56.273 --> 21:57.900
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.244
Of course.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.909
You said you're defending
the man that ki...

22:03.572 --> 22:04.573
That man.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.081
<i>I represent James Barr, yes.</i>

22:09.245 --> 22:11.247
<i>And you have questions
about my daughter?</i>

22:12.081 --> 22:13.424
<i>I do.</i>

22:15.251 --> 22:16.594
<i>What for?</i>

22:17.086 --> 22:20.761
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

22:21.257 --> 22:22.858
That is to say, who they were as people.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.723
- As human beings.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.102
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

22:33.435 --> 22:34.436
That is true.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.278
<i>Normally someone in my position
would want the jury</i>

22:38.440 --> 22:40.784
<i>to know as little as possible about the...</i>

22:41.110 --> 22:43.784
<i>The people that your client killed.</i>

22:44.780 --> 22:46.123
<i>In cold blood.</i>

22:52.246 --> 22:53.998
Have you spoken
with the other families?

22:54.123 --> 22:57.252
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.012
Come in.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.480
Thank you.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.767
<i>Chrissie was a nanny.</i>

25:11.385 --> 25:13.058
She had a little girl with her that day.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.434
Yes, I know.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.769
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

25:20.102 --> 25:21.775
No, of course not. I...

25:22.938 --> 25:23.939
Why not?

25:24.231 --> 25:26.905
- Well, I think it would be...
- Insensitive?

25:28.444 --> 25:29.616
Inappropriate?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.792
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter

25:38.120 --> 25:39.121
is right here.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.463
The <i> Gazette</i> did a nice piece on her.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.930
Her obituary does the rest.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.603
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.306
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.643
- That's not really for me to...
- Just

26:01.101 --> 26:02.444
answer the question.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.983
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.151
Good enough to keep
that man off death row?

26:10.319 --> 26:11.662
You know,

26:12.112 --> 26:13.455
I think maybe I should go.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.157
You stay where you are.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.840
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.133
Why would you defend him?

26:28.337 --> 26:31.341
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.

26:32.508 --> 26:36.513
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.278
Hello, Dad.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.701
What the hell are you doing?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.369
What am I... What?

26:52.528 --> 26:53.529
Is it true?

26:53.695 --> 26:55.735
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

26:56.824 --> 26:58.747
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.120
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.250
That's not an answer.

27:02.371 --> 27:06.547
Oh. Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.378
That's right. I know about Reacher.

27:09.711 --> 27:12.055
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

27:12.172 --> 27:14.721
who's been missing
for the last two years.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.637
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.062
How can you trust anything he tells you?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.396
You don't know the man.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.727
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

27:25.060 --> 27:27.233
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

27:27.354 --> 27:29.573
That nobody wants this case?

27:30.566 --> 27:33.536
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.335
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.449
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

27:38.574 --> 27:40.247
you gotta listen to me now.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.588
You're making a terrible mistake.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.424
You cannot win this case.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.421
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

27:52.421 --> 27:55.425
To hurt me? To change me?

27:55.591 --> 27:57.264
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!

28:09.563 --> 28:11.243
Thanks for letting me take a look.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.275
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

28:13.442 --> 28:15.069
try to tear our work to shreds.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.620
He's not my friend.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.782
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.288
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.463
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.175
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.796
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.800
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

28:36.924 --> 28:38.642
No, thanks. Don't need to.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.469
You never took any notes.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.142
Oh, I don't need to.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.311
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

28:48.936 --> 28:50.279
I did all right.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.320
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

28:53.815 --> 28:56.819
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

28:56.985 --> 28:57.986
What's that?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.831
Every suspect was a trained killer.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.125
Thanks again.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.174
Why do you think he paid for parking?

29:13.669 --> 29:14.795
Pardon?

29:14.962 --> 29:18.683
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.176
And he's worried about the meter maid?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.016
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

29:23.303 --> 29:25.351
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.687
Huh.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.689
Habit.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.695
Muscle memory.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.356
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.702
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.033
Hey, Army.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.699
What's the serial number on the rifle?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.276
What's the date on the quarter?

29:52.374 --> 29:53.546
1968.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.718
Forest for the trees, Detective.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.724
Forest for the trees.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.380
Mind if I share your table?

31:19.378 --> 31:20.470
I'm Sandy.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.632
So was I. Last week.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.468
On a beach, in Florida.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.564
What's your name?

31:33.558 --> 31:34.980
Jimmie Reese.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.572
You don't look like a Jimmie.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.695
What do I look like?

31:42.651 --> 31:45.495
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

31:45.904 --> 31:46.996
Hmm.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.915
So you're new in town?

31:49.658 --> 31:51.001
Usually.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.499
It's kind of loud in here.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.837
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.505
You're old enough to drive?

32:00.419 --> 32:02.763
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.682
I'm on a budget, Sandy.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.266
What?

32:07.509 --> 32:08.852
I can't afford you.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.516
I'm not a hooker.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.182
Oh, then I really can't afford you.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.022
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.

32:17.102 --> 32:20.697
What I mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.701
I am not a hooker!

32:24.860 --> 32:26.362
No. A hooker would get the joke.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.535
- What's this?
- He called me a whore.

32:33.535 --> 32:34.707
Is that true?

32:38.540 --> 32:42.215
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.213
Hey. That's our sister.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.556
Is she a good kisser?

32:47.883 --> 32:49.556
Hey. Outside.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.392
Pay your cheque first.

32:52.554 --> 32:53.555
I'll pay later.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.228
You won't be able to.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.733
You think?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.395
All the time. You should try it.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.980
It's a great joke,
but I'm going to beat your ass.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.815
Do you want to do that here or outside?

33:09.070 --> 33:10.413
Outside.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.331
Stay here, Sandy.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.330
I don't mind the sight of blood.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.084
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.772
You still think you're funny now, creep?

33:42.938 --> 33:45.441
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.366
It's your last chance to walk away.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.119
Are you kidding? It's five against one.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.130
It's three against one.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.464
How do you figure?

34:04.709 --> 34:07.383
Well, once I take out the leader,
which is you,

34:07.629 --> 34:11.304
I'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.806
The last two guys, they always run.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.646
Oh, you've done this before?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.223
Yeah.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.643
It's getting late.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.404
Remember,

34:26.147 --> 34:27.569
you wanted this.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.120
It's okay. You're okay.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.076
- Get up.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.503
Okay.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.260
Now we know who's who.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.931
Let's get this done.

35:08.690 --> 35:09.862
Really?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.535
Shit!

35:23.538 --> 35:24.881
On the ground!

35:25.040 --> 35:26.963
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.380
Do it!

35:36.384 --> 35:37.727
Hands behind your back.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.061
Who hired you?

35:44.225 --> 35:45.397
Let's go.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.334
Hey, Helen.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.420
Am I wearing too much perfume?

36:05.330 --> 36:08.425
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.253
- Somebody dead?
- And if someone is?

36:13.254 --> 36:16.258
Then they died of shame.
'Cause I was being gentle.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.595
I'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.684
So no one's dead.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.607
One guy
likely won't ever walk right again.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.110
- You want to charge me.
- Very much.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.444
But no one's pressing.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.280
Sadly, no.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.368
Am I free to go?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.118
Hey, Emerson.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.792
4862681.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.627
What's that?

36:48.873 --> 36:51.717
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.467
You're working for me,
do you understand that?

36:59.718 --> 37:03.643
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.

37:03.805 --> 37:04.806
I was set up.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.065
You're talking to a lawyer.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.065
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.737
Which never happens in a bar.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.897
She was thrown
when I told her my name.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.224
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

37:14.315 --> 37:15.988
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.741
Yankees second baseman.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.281
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.164
I always use Yankees second basemen.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.497
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...

37:29.497 --> 37:32.171
Look, the point is,

37:32.250 --> 37:34.173
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

37:34.335 --> 37:35.427
She knew who I was.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.505
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.516
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.183
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.519
Who?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.646
If someone followed you
at the river today,

37:52.729 --> 37:54.527
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

37:54.606 --> 37:56.108
There are three things cops never do.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.860
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

37:58.943 --> 38:01.116
and they never use personal vehicles.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.622
It's not a cop.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.876
A P.I., then, or the D.A.'s office.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.791
You think your father's office
would set me up?

38:07.869 --> 38:09.121
Why would anyone set you up?

38:09.204 --> 38:10.456
How was your day?

38:10.538 --> 38:12.040
It went exactly the way I think

38:13.041 --> 38:14.793
you hoped it would.

38:16.878 --> 38:17.925
You Okay?

38:19.047 --> 38:20.094
Mmm-hmm.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.805
What'd you learn?

38:25.804 --> 38:28.307
<i>Chrissie Farrior was 22.</i>

38:29.474 --> 38:33.320
<i>A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.</i>

38:34.813 --> 38:37.407
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

38:37.482 --> 38:39.610
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

38:39.984 --> 38:44.160
<i>But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:48.668
<i>They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:56.339
<i>Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.</i>

38:57.085 --> 38:59.929
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.470
<i>Since her son Marco
was nine years old</i>

39:02.590 --> 39:06.561
<i>she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.</i>

39:06.636 --> 39:08.809
<i>But her dedication had paid off.</i>

39:09.347 --> 39:11.691
<i>Marco was now an honour student.</i>

39:12.100 --> 39:13.977
<i>As a reward for all his hard work,</i>

39:14.102 --> 39:16.275
<i>Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.</i>

39:17.021 --> 39:20.321
<i>And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:25.368
<i>Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were</i> a <i>lie.</i>

39:25.697 --> 39:27.290
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.208
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

39:29.284 --> 39:31.537
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.753
It's perfect.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.912
<i>She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.</i>

39:39.210 --> 39:42.134
<i>She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary</i>

39:43.631 --> 39:45.633
<i>- just a few days away.</i>
- Thank you.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.223
<i>Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,</i>

39:51.556 --> 39:56.062
<i>even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.</i>

39:56.561 --> 40:00.611
<i>So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit</i>

40:00.690 --> 40:02.488
<i>were forcing them
to sell to the competition.</i>

40:02.734 --> 40:03.826
Rob?

40:04.319 --> 40:05.696
Help! Help!

40:08.323 --> 40:11.327
<i>Her husband
had given his life for the company.</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:14.245
<i>But now that it was hers,</i>

40:14.746 --> 40:16.840
<i>she couldn't bring herself to let it go.</i>

40:22.420 --> 40:25.094
<i>She was on her way
to secure a loan that day</i>

40:25.340 --> 40:28.435
<i>so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.</i>

40:29.427 --> 40:31.600
<i>Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker</i>

40:31.679 --> 40:33.773
<i>in the same building where Rita worked.</i>

40:34.015 --> 40:37.110
<i>His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.</i>

40:37.352 --> 40:42.028
<i>She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.</i>

40:42.440 --> 40:44.693
<i>Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses</i>

40:44.776 --> 40:46.778
<i>he'd bought that morning</i>

40:46.945 --> 40:50.290
<i>and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,</i>

40:50.531 --> 40:52.954
<i>he was most likely thinking of her.</i>

41:12.804 --> 41:15.023
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.475
We're gonna be okay.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.560
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

41:18.643 --> 41:20.244
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.250
So what'd you learn?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.162
You want me to say you were right.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.122
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.837
James Barr should die.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.465
Maybe he should.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.470
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.551
What more do you want?

41:47.630 --> 41:49.849
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.926
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.515
This is my shirt.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.105
You lose your luggage?

41:56.264 --> 41:57.766
I don't have any luggage.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.685
Uh, what was I saying?

42:00.852 --> 42:03.355
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.110
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

42:09.610 --> 42:10.782
Two and a half million.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.205
That means every day,

42:13.364 --> 42:17.119
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

42:17.452 --> 42:20.501
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.622
Is that random?

42:21.706 --> 42:23.128
What else would you call it?

42:23.207 --> 42:26.427
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.549
Excuse me?

42:27.628 --> 42:30.347
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.138
<i>You buy them on the way home.</i>

42:33.217 --> 42:35.811
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

42:35.887 --> 42:37.639
when your anniversary is that weekend.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.979
<i>Unless it's the gift you're hiding.</i>

42:43.644 --> 42:45.021
And that's why she kept walking

42:47.398 --> 42:49.400
while everyone else ran.

42:49.650 --> 42:50.993
You can't prove that.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.580
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.668
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.828
What's your point exactly?

43:00.912 --> 43:04.416
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.260
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.513
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.761
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.263
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

43:15.343 --> 43:16.686
Yeah, exactly.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.935
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

43:20.014 --> 43:22.312
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.860
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

43:25.728 --> 43:26.775
gun ranges.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.652
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

43:28.731 --> 43:29.903
What do we hope to find?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.194
I need some sleep.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.787
You, too.

43:35.530 --> 43:36.930
You don't really think I'm gonna...

43:43.621 --> 43:45.623
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.387
Yep. Absolutely.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.845
Who's with you?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.509
What happened?

44:35.673 --> 44:37.346
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

44:38.176 --> 44:39.519
I ain't seeing you, man!

44:39.760 --> 44:41.433
Relax. What happened?

44:43.014 --> 44:45.312
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.527
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.697
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.527
So?

44:54.150 --> 44:56.369
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.323
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.203
Almost like he knew something.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.706
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.207
No, we sure don't.

45:06.454 --> 45:07.797
So I took steps.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.880
You took steps.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.382
Local people. My guys.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.304
And it blew back on you.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.932
I figured five guys would do it.

45:18.007 --> 45:21.056
Mmm. This franchise
was yours to manage.

45:21.385 --> 45:24.229
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.352
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

45:25.473 --> 45:26.474
Well, that's how this works.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.900
Well, I had to make a decision!

45:28.142 --> 45:30.691
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.055
Any of them know who you are?

45:32.563 --> 45:34.156
Just one, but I took care of it.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.658
You...

45:37.401 --> 45:39.529
- Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

45:40.738 --> 45:41.785
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.162
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

45:44.242 --> 45:47.246
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.088
Clean!

45:49.664 --> 45:51.211
A missing person isn't clean.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.815
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.314
You tapped five! You call that clean?

45:55.336 --> 45:59.512
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

45:59.674 --> 46:00.766
Jesus.

46:01.092 --> 46:04.847
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

46:04.929 --> 46:08.103
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.276
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.030
- Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!

46:14.272 --> 46:16.115
It makes no difference now.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.122
I made a mistake.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.875
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

46:29.954 --> 46:33.800
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

46:34.125 --> 46:37.129
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.968
All right. You're right.

46:39.046 --> 46:40.548
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.305
Just tell me what I have to do.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.055
I was in prison in Siberia.

46:47.471 --> 46:51.146
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.648
A hole in one pocket.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.988
I chewed these fingers off

46:56.063 --> 46:59.158
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

47:01.319 --> 47:05.165
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.994
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.669
A man this rare can always be of use.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.174
So show me. Show me you are rare.

47:20.004 --> 47:22.427
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.476
I don't understand.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.517
The fingers from your left hand.

47:53.871 --> 47:57.341
Have you... Have you got a knife?

47:57.541 --> 48:00.135
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

48:02.880 --> 48:06.475
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.640
You can do it.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.396
Show me.

48:42.253 --> 48:43.596
Christ!

48:44.588 --> 48:46.886
Can't! I can't.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.139
Always the bullet.

48:49.218 --> 48:50.891
- I can't!
- I don't understand.

48:58.102 --> 48:59.775
What do we do about the soldier?

49:00.438 --> 49:02.065
What we always do.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.828
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

49:11.449 --> 49:14.293
Coffee. You take it black, right?

49:20.291 --> 49:22.635
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.106
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

49:40.936 --> 49:44.065
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

49:46.150 --> 49:49.620
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

49:50.154 --> 49:52.657
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.078
Sure, if you tell me why.

49:54.158 --> 49:56.661
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

49:56.785 --> 49:58.002
and again on Sunday.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.760
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.091
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.174
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

50:06.504 --> 50:09.633
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.511
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.018
I'm guessing every Saturday.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.603
Maybe with a friend.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.435
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

50:21.519 --> 50:22.645
Assuming he had any.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.355
Drop me at the auto parts store.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.323
I... Wait. Which one?

50:26.857 --> 50:28.859
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

50:28.943 --> 50:29.990
She? Who?

50:30.110 --> 50:31.612
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

50:31.695 --> 50:34.039
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

50:34.365 --> 50:37.665
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

50:47.378 --> 50:48.880
You want me to wait?

50:50.005 --> 50:53.126
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- How will you get there?

50:56.720 --> 50:58.188
I'll hitch a ride.

51:40.764 --> 51:41.936
Can I help you?

51:42.266 --> 51:43.313
Sandy work here?

51:45.644 --> 51:46.691
What's this about?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.941
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.

51:50.065 --> 51:51.442
It's a personal matter.

51:52.067 --> 51:54.911
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.

51:56.071 --> 51:57.243
What are you, a cop?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.409
Call her out, Gary.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.087
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.623
Well, I need to see something.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.759
How about the inside of an ambulance?

52:11.962 --> 52:14.761
Okay, I'm calling the police.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.470
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

52:19.595 --> 52:20.812
- Hello?
...but let's ask.

52:21.055 --> 52:22.102
Hey! You...

52:22.306 --> 52:25.310
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

52:26.477 --> 52:29.356
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

52:35.444 --> 52:36.616
Shit.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.333
You know this guy?

52:41.617 --> 52:42.664
Tell him.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.295
Give us a few, Gary.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.056
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.726
I didn't know that was going to happen!

53:08.519 --> 53:09.566
It was Jeb.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.356
The big guy.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.363
Jeb Oliver.

53:17.194 --> 53:21.665
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to star groping me.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.673
Just don't hurt me.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.213
Sandy, sit down.

53:35.254 --> 53:36.346
Where can I find Jeb?

53:36.880 --> 53:38.560
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

53:38.590 --> 53:39.887
So he works here.

53:40.384 --> 53:41.556
Yeah.

53:42.886 --> 53:45.560
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.103
His address, write it down.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.896
I'm really sorry, mister.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.574
You were supposed to be a pervert.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.236
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

53:59.528 --> 54:00.575
That's all?

54:02.906 --> 54:06.706
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

54:11.248 --> 54:12.591
Am I in trouble?

54:15.711 --> 54:17.429
Not if you lend me your car.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.636
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.

54:21.550 --> 54:22.790
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.725
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

54:26.096 --> 54:28.269
I can't. It's Jeb's car!

54:28.474 --> 54:31.648
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.

54:38.734 --> 54:40.111
Who are you, mister?

54:40.611 --> 54:41.783
Really?

54:48.619 --> 54:51.247
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.257
I get off work at six!

54:56.794 --> 54:58.512
Maybe we could...

54:58.962 --> 55:00.635
Sandy, listen.

55:02.424 --> 55:04.097
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.436
You're pretty.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.939
You're obviously sharp,

55:09.097 --> 55:10.644
doing Gary's books for him.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.940
You don't have to
let these guys use you.

55:16.939 --> 55:19.488
It's just what girls like me do.

55:23.737 --> 55:24.784
You got money?

55:26.114 --> 55:27.161
A little.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.997
Get out of town for a couple of days.

55:30.494 --> 55:31.541
Why?

55:33.831 --> 55:35.674
Get out of town, Sandy.

56:20.377 --> 56:21.424
Is Jeb home?

56:27.718 --> 56:30.437
I have a warrant to search the premises.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.903
I see.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.569
Well, if you don't mind...

58:49.067 --> 58:51.490
Get him! Get him! Get him!

59:00.245 --> 59:01.918
I got this!

59:01.997 --> 59:03.044
Okay, okay.

59:04.041 --> 59:05.668
All right.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:06.820
Don't move.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:08.822
I'll tell you what.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.109
When I move, you pull the trigger.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:14.035
Aah!

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.408
Aah!

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:17.702
- Where's Jeb?
- He's not here.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:19.124
Where can I find him?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.746
Jesus! My hand!

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.067
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can I find him?

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:26.169
- You're the one driving his car.
- You tell...

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:29.130
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.756
He said he had to see a guy.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.592
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.097
I don't know, I swear.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.683
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:37.975
and his shit's all gone.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.437
Is he the sort to light out like that?

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.098
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.433
Shit ain't right.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.268
- Got a car?
- It's outside.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:47.565
Keys.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.362
My hand, man.
They're in my pock... Aah!

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:50.864
Okay, okay.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.372
Now look at your friends.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.165
Now look at my face.

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:05.207
Do you ever want to see me again?

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.046
No way.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.046
Am I stealing your car?

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.346
Use it as long as you like.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.007
You're very kind.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.383
Ah!

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.954
<i>I think Jeb Oliver's dead.</i>

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:47.496
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.424
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.594
What? No, not me.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.047
No, he was murdered.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.007
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.592
Well, maybe he just left town.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:02.435
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.642
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.519
What is that on your head?

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:08.854
Uh...

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.565
You don't want to know.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.532
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:25.458
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.452
But he trained non-stop for two years.

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:28.815
What does training like that do?

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.831
What does any training do?

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.793
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.470
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.965
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.468
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.143
didn't exist in Baghdad,

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:47.189
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:51.397
<i>See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.</i>

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:54.654
<i>Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.</i>

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:57.403
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

01:02:57.482 --> 01:03:00.201
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:03.155
<i>Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.</i>

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.033
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.827
and the exact same conditions

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.372
<i>he would've had
up on that highway bridge.</i>

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:15.467
<i>Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.</i>

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.470
<i>No parking meter.</i>

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.717
<i>No camera.</i>

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:24.221
<i>No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.</i>

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.015
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.517
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.643
Not that way.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.191
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.268
Well, what exactly are you saying?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:37.026
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:39.733
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.818
And who the hell pays for parking?

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:44.701
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:49.455
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.379
That would not explain how Barr,

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:57.626
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:58.964
He did miss.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:00.594
He did.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:04.932
A pristine bullet,

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:08.353
<i>conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.</i>

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.896
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.861
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:20.574
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.552
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:25.078
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.868
and if he wanted to get caught,

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.791
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:31.828
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.083
That's what I was willing to accept,

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.127
then those guys took a run at me.

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.709
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:41.261
It was just a bar fight.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.716
Maybe.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:46.599
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:51.393
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.767
Patsy?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.730
It was such a great crime scene.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.781
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.404
<i>Not Emerson.</i>

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.239
<i>Not your father.</i>

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.954
<i>Not even Barr's own defence attorney.</i>

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.287
<i>But Barr knew I would,</i>

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.625
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.332
That's why he asked for me.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.297
Wait.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.677
Are you suggesting...

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.926
James Barr is innocent.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:37.104
You can see what this is, can't you?

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.611
You've got a case in your hands

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.814
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.780
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:48.611
Helen.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.455
You know,
you never should have retired.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.158
Just, look. Listen.

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:54.746
For all I know, you were
standing at an intersection

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:56.306
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:58.625
And I hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.792
- Helen. Helen.
- It makes total sense now.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.710
It's the way you live,
the way you move around.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.467
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.048
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.371
- Helen.
- Is that what this is?

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.513
Look out the window.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:11.972
No, I have work to do.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.303
- And you need to leave.
- Just humour me. Okay.

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:14.892
Let go of me.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.482
- Would you tell me what you see?
- I see the same

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.149
things I see every day.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.355
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.861
Imagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.697
being told every day
you're defending freedom.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.161
And finally
you decide you've had enough.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:38.253
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.956
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.129
Look at the people.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.712
Now tell me which ones are free.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.970
Free from debt.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.634
Anxiety.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.969
Stress.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.304
Fear.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:59.061
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.563
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.819
Ask yourself how many would do things

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.571
the same way all over again?

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:12.029
And how many would
live their lives like me?

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:18.205
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.252
the one that's been following me all day.

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:21.921
What does that prove?

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.421
Here's the tag number.
How long would it take you to run it?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.003
At this time of night?
I don't know. An hour?

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:29.212
Do it.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.515
Do it, and then I'll leave.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:42.938
When?

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:50.192
No, this is my problem now.
I'll handle it.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.319
Yeah?

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.538
You're blown.

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:59.284
The lawyer's running the license plates.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.120
Yeah. So do it?

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:04.918
Done.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.298
Go to this address.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.424
All right, let’s just say
that Barr didn't do it.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.392
Or did it 'cause someone
put him up to it.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.667
Either way, what have you got?

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:18.810
Conspiracy.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.684
Yeah, conspiracy to kill
five random people?

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.060
There's no motive.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.484
- It's ridiculous, right?
- It's grassy knoll ludicrous.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.394
No point looking any further.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.983
Exactly.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.613
Exactly.

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:34.573
What's this?

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.830
The motive. Just hold onto it.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.121
What are we playing, Clue?

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.117
Yeah?

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:43.836
Give it to me.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.212
Thank you.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.774
You sure
that car was following you all day?

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.863
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.953
It's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.888
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.716
That's ridiculous.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:42.562
Four.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.898
Four random people.

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:49.520
To hide one specific target.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:17.214
Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:22.305
<i>And Oline wouldn't let it go.</i>

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.815
It's a convincing theory.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.493
But it's just a theory.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.326
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.669
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.080
<i>between the first and second rounds.</i>

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.086
<i>The one shot where the killer
took his time.</i>

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.926
<i>And Oline Archer
was the second victim.</i>

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:58.843
The one shot that mattered.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.300
But it's just a theory.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.428
This frame was custom made for Barr.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.222
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.979
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.604
was Barr himself.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:15.188
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.865
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.609
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:22.536
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.114
What about catching the guys
who really did this?

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.291
- Catching the guys who did this?
- Bringing them to justice?

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.526
- No, I can't take this to court.
- Exposing the truth.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:32.209
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:36.714
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.881
And frankly, neither are you.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:47.720
I can't do this any more.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.443
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:31.393
Sandy?

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.402
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.651
Do I know you?

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.159
Charlie. Jeb's friend?

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.412
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.039
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.993
Well, we were both pretty wasted.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:54.753
Oh.

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:57.840
- Yeah.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:01.802
- What, you live here?
- Just up there.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.471
No shit.

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:07.179
I just moved in around the back!
How crazy is that?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.017
It's wild.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.140
Yeah.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.974
Wow! You look great.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.105
Thanks.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:21.364
Well, look, you know,
I don't want to keep you, so...

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.032
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.571
Yeah, maybe.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.407
Hey, how about tonight?

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.456
I'm meeting some people.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:34.206
Okay. Well, some other time, then.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.836
Some other time.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.004
Do it here.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.168
What?

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.711
Reacher!

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:40.731
There's a gun range in Ohio,
targets out to 700 yards.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.901
The only range
that matches your requirements.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:49.989
You should sleep.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.159
You have a long drive tomorrow,

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:55.913
and I need to go to city hall
and pull up Oline's legal history.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.917
I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:04.213
If I'm right,
someone killed four random people

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.464
so no one would look directly at Oline.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:10.340
And if I'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:13.176
- You saying I should be scared?
- Well, are you smart?

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:14.723
Obviously.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.179
Then don't be scared.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.134
What exactly am I looking for?

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.804
Someone who could kill that girl
with one punch.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.312
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.640
Ernie Johnson.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.271
You'll see.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.441
Out of the car!

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:40.247
That's our suspect! Move, move!

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.183
Suspect is headed north
on State Route 65.

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:05.856
I need backup and air support.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.481
Hold up!

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.191
All clear!

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.046
Oh, God,
I just don't believe it. I don't believe it!

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.793
I issued the warrant an hour ago.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.298
According to the victim's boss,

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.051
Reacher was seen at her
place of work this morning.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:12.806
Where he threatened her boss.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.885
The car he was driving tonight
belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:17.135
The man he assaulted.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:18.971
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.931
Reacher put three more men
in the hospital

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:22.494
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.731
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:27.024
And Jeb hasn't been seen
since he left the hospital.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.732
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,
you need to tell us.

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:31.358
I don't know where he is.
I have not seen him

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.906
since he left my office a few hours ago.

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.629
- I think she's telling the truth.
- Oh, you think, Dad? Fuck you!

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:40.833
Hey, I told you not to go near him.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:43.332
You come into my home
and you treat me like I'm an accessory!

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.506
- Please! You know...
- All right. All right. Come on. Enough.

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.673
- Look, let me handle it.
- I'm not done.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.113
You're both done. Just get out.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:54.764
This is Helen.

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:56.303
<i>I'm guessing the police are there?</i>

01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:57.430
Yep.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.645
<i>By your response I'm guessing
I have about 30 seconds</i>

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.960
<i>before you hand them the phone.</i>

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:02.397
If that.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.316
<i>If you believe someone
could frame Barr,</i>

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:06.769
<i>you have to believe
they could do the same to me.</i>

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:08.566
I suppose that's possible.

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.773
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.943
And they killed her because of me.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.951
They want me to run.

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.032
But I won't.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.039
<i>- I'm going to finish this.</i>
- No, that's not a good idea.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.210
<i>Listen.</i>

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:27.415
Two things. One, I, uh...

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.917
I stole your car.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:32.590
<i>If you want to end this,</i>

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.054
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.301
And I'll understand.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.807
And anything else?

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.685
I thought I'd be pushing it
if I mentioned this earlier.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.637
Now I guess all bets are off.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.939
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.562
<i>I think one of them is in on it.</i>

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.986
All right. Thanks for calling. I have to go.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:51.150
<i>Wait. I've been followed from day one.</i>

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.779
Only three people knew I was here.

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:57.160
<i>Emerson, your father and you.</i>

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.030
<i>You need to ask yourself,</i>

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.956
<i>who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?</i>

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.336
<i>Who tried to warn you off me?</i>

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.332
<i>Of course, I could be wrong.
If you think I am,</i>

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:12.084
<i>just hand over the phone.</i>

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.669
There's no sense getting any deeper.

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:16.133
Who's that you're talking to?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.594
The office.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:23.812
Are we done?

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.138
Helen, listen.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:26.718
- We need to...
- Good night.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.927
You got some fine shooters here.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.597
Fine as frog's hair.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.273
Rarer, too.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.066
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:58.278
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.613
they'll suck it.

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:06.414
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:08.117
Aaron Ward.

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:10.376
What can I do you for,
Mr Ward? Ward?

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:14.002
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in Iraq.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.800
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:17.880
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.256
Anyway, he was a shooter.

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:20.970
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.097
When did he get out of the Army?

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.306
Well, I didn't say the Army.

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.430
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:32.141
Man on a flying horse could see that.

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:34.438
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.487
Well,
that makes you half human.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:40.277
Your friend got a name?

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.575
Yeah. James Barr.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.162
James Barr.

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.073
Never heard of him.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:49.950
I think you have.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.002
I think you've been dreading the moment

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.167
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:58.171
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:02.637
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:05.307
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:10.187
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:12.139
only that he came hereto rehearse.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:13.811
She'd have a case to shut you down

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.856
and nothing better to do.

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:18.858
What do you want?

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.323
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:27.612
Those boys out there,

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:31.663
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:35.871
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.960
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.131
I work for Barr's attorney.

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:41.050
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:42.259
The hell you say.

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:47.057
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.846
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.312
And if I don't?

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.313
Maybe you can coach soccer.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:05.067
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:09.158
Can I have a few to warm up?

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:34.956
Six inches right.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.994
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.
Play ball!

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:41.296
Let's go.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.839
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.840
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.558
what, ten years ago.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:39.021
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.227
in 1925.

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:43.729
Now,

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.228
I'll answer one question.

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:48.696
Who's your best shooter?

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.407
James Barr.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:57.656
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:04.667
That's the best shot

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:06.919
I ever seen this side of civilian life.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:12.342
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.515
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.592
Do you hang them downrange, too?

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:19.599
What, are you serious?

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.105
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:25.196
One who switched the targets
on the range.

01:33:25.225 --> 01:33:26.568
Maybe Barr let him.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.942
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:34.443
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.948
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:42.124
and using your range to do it.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.581
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:52.760
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.008
Hell, the camera's there

01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:56.431
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

01:33:58.424 --> 01:33:59.596
There's Barr.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.888
I always liked him. Always liked him.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.063
There.

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:06.270
Him.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.738
That son of a bitch.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.154
Helen Rodin speaking.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:20.952
<i>Got a candidate for our shooter.</i>

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.500
Picture, possible prints

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:25.994
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.749
I can't talk right now.

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.332
Just give me three hours to get back.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.500
<i>And don't talk to anyone until I get there.</i>

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.468
I'll look into that, thanks.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.181
This is just
what I could pull this morning.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:42.435
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.228
Shell corporation in Georgia.

01:34:44.304 --> 01:34:46.682
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:51.194
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:53.320
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:57.196
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:02.031
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:07.202
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:10.171
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.382
Always amidst allegations of corruption

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:16.969
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:21.391
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:25.558
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:32.143
Well, maybe that's because

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:36.023
the allegations come
from the competition.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.025
Outbid. Bitter.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.069
Like Oline Archer.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:44.994
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.043
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:51.663
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.919
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.213
It doesn't matter how much I believe.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:58.841
It doesn't even matter
how much I can prove.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.423
It only matters how much is true.

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:03.716
Do you know how delusional you sound?

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:05.890
What happened to you?

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:10.437
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:24.950
I pulled all of this paper
under my own name.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.790
If Jack Reacher's right,

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:31.628
my life, your daughter's life,

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:34.130
is in danger now.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.792
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:40.219
whether you're involved or not.

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:47.060
You are the District Attorney
and I've given you compelling evidence

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:49.058
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:53.316
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:54.980
Oh.

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:57.612
I see. It's a test.

01:36:58.771 --> 01:37:03.652
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but I do love you.

01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:08.156
And obviously I'm not
going to turn a blind eye,

01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.659
no matter how absurd I find all of this.

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:15.623
So, if you really believe
that you're in danger,

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:17.499
if you believe that,

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.961
then the next order of business,

01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:25.177
is to put you
in protective custody right now.

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.266
And how safe will I be
if you're part of it?

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.305
Jesus, Helen.

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.323
Oh. Hey.

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:35.035
Business meeting or personal?

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.245
Hard to tell them apart.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.080
I'll bet.

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:42.314
Helen?

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.561
<i>No.</i>

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.614
Sorry, wrong number.

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:48.566
<i>Is this Reacher?</i>

01:39:50.943 --> 01:39:52.069
Who is this?

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:57.625
Is this Reacher?

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:05.584
It's you. The guy from the car.

01:40:08.085 --> 01:40:09.302
It's your boyfriend.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:12.473
Reacher, is it you?

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:15.092
Helen, are you hurt?

01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:17.341
Well, she's gonna be
if you're not here in one hour.

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:20.143
Do I have to tell you how this works?

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:22.062
You'll bounce me around
to make sure I'm not followed,

01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:24.610
then walk me into
an ambush and kill me.

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.983
<i>Aw, you ruined my surprise.</i>

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:28.944
Well, I can do one better.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.659
I went down to the gun range
at Hinge Creek.

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:35.621
<i>I got the picture, prints,
and I'm going to the Feds.</i>

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:37.453
The lawyer's all yours.

01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:43.000
Get the Zec.

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:54.511
On second thought, I'd like to kill you.

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:56.221
<i>Let's say winner take all.</i>

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:57.347
Listen to me, you prick.

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:59.468
I will kill this bitch
if you're not here in one...

01:41:00.846 --> 01:41:02.143
Shit!

01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:10.148
<i>You think I'm a hero?</i>

01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:14.202
I am not a hero.
I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.

01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:17.371
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:21.493
I mean to beat you to death
and drink your blood from a boot.

01:41:22.368 --> 01:41:26.043
<i>Now, this is how it's going to work.
You're gonna give me the address</i>

01:41:26.205 --> 01:41:28.628
and I'll be along
when I am damn good and ready.

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:30.961
If she doesn't answer the phone
when I call this number,

01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:32.886
if I even think you've hurt her,

01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:34.714
I disappear.

01:41:34.839 --> 01:41:39.640
And if you're smart, that scares you,
because I'm in your blind spot

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:41.847
and I have nothing better to do.

01:41:50.062 --> 01:41:51.109
You got a pen?

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:54.575
Don't need one.

01:42:58.964 --> 01:43:03.470
If I had a dollar for every time
the Army called the Corps for help.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:07.648
- You have something for me?
- Yeah.

01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:09.775
Here.

01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:15.318
You're kidding, right?

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:16.907
Just because I saw you
shoot ten years ago

01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:20.452
doesn't mean I'll let you
kill some asshole with my gun.

01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:22.371
I told you how serious this was.

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:24.328
And I showed up, didn't I?

01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:26.329
So let's get to it.

01:43:28.285 --> 01:43:29.332
<i>Now, your shooter will be</i>

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:32.924
right up there
behind those lights. Okay?

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:35.968
He can cover both roads
coming and going.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:39.839
And kill you
just as soon as you stand up.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.136
Well, can you take him out?

01:43:41.674 --> 01:43:42.926
What, to dinner you mean?

01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:49.356
Look, I don't know the type of people
you normally associate with, Reacher.

01:43:49.682 --> 01:43:54.688
But I'm not in the habit of driving out
to the boonies at the drop of a hat

01:43:55.146 --> 01:43:58.491
and just picking off
some total strangers, all right?

01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:02.202
Anyway, I can't see anything,
not with them lights up.

01:44:02.319 --> 01:44:03.866
So shoot them out.

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.408
Yeah, sure.
And then he knows right where I am.

01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:09.493
I might as well set myself on fire.

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:13.415
No, sir. I'll start shooting when he does.

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:18.169
And how do you propose
we get him started?

01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:22.511
Well, you could always start running.

01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:31.561
What's wrong with your eye?

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.355
I'm saving my night vision.

01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:40.571
Hey, Gunny, you mind if I ask you
kind of a personal question?

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.534
What, you don't think
I can shoot any more?

01:44:43.235 --> 01:44:44.862
It is a perishable skill.

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:47.081
Yeah, well,

01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.750
the sun will be up in an hour.

01:44:51.243 --> 01:44:52.586
Let's get going.

01:45:09.595 --> 01:45:11.768
I heard them call you the Zec.

01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:13.899
That means "prisoner."

01:45:15.768 --> 01:45:16.940
Yes?

01:45:19.855 --> 01:45:21.277
Tell me, killing all those people,

01:45:22.024 --> 01:45:23.526
I have to believe the money
you're making

01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:25.031
can't possibly be enough to just...

01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:26.362
Enough?

01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:28.455
There is no such thing.

01:45:28.781 --> 01:45:30.783
We take what can be taken.

01:45:31.116 --> 01:45:32.663
This is what we do.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.463
And you?

01:45:38.123 --> 01:45:40.717
This one I think I understand, but you?

01:45:41.377 --> 01:45:42.469
Why'd you do it?

01:45:42.795 --> 01:45:45.139
You make it sound like I had a choice.

01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:46.469
Oh, didn't you?

01:45:49.969 --> 01:45:51.312
You'll see.

01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:58.485
You should know I've taken steps,
that if anything happens...

01:45:58.561 --> 01:46:02.282
if anything happens to you,
it will happen in front of your father

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:04.446
while he begs for your life.

01:46:06.652 --> 01:46:08.996
You should never have involved him.

01:46:09.321 --> 01:46:13.042
Now you will have to convince him
to forget, for your sake

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:15.370
and for his.

01:46:16.245 --> 01:46:19.920
You say nothing,
but I see defiance in your eyes.

01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:23.510
That is a look I have seen
many, many times.

01:46:23.836 --> 01:46:26.180
When the soldier comes,

01:46:26.255 --> 01:46:28.678
when you watch how he dies,
it will change you.

01:46:29.174 --> 01:46:31.393
You will want to forget me then.

01:46:42.187 --> 01:46:43.439
Reacher?

01:46:43.522 --> 01:46:44.865
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:46:45.107 --> 01:46:46.324
They're ready for you.

01:46:47.276 --> 01:46:48.903
They'd like to think so.

01:46:49.862 --> 01:46:52.365
Don't do this.
Please don't do this. Not for me.

01:46:52.448 --> 01:46:54.075
<i>Listen, Helen, they're not gonna</i>

01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:58.170
hurt you until they have me.
And that's never going to happen.

01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:59.542
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:47:00.623 --> 01:47:01.715
You just hang in there.

01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:05.385
'Cause I'm coming to get you.

01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:08.472
Now say you believe me.

01:47:09.965 --> 01:47:11.342
I believe you.

01:47:43.165 --> 01:47:45.042
This was a bad idea.

01:48:03.936 --> 01:48:05.563
Any time now, Gunny.

01:48:20.619 --> 01:48:22.212
Shit.

01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:35.429
Where the hell are you, Gunny?

01:52:53.725 --> 01:52:55.398
Suck it!

01:53:06.571 --> 01:53:08.073
You should go.

01:53:51.283 --> 01:53:52.626
Toss it.

01:56:51.046 --> 01:56:53.140
I know you're in there, Emerson.

01:56:56.968 --> 01:56:59.642
It was staring me right in the face.

01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:04.810
The one piece that just didn't fit.

01:57:05.644 --> 01:57:07.112
The quarter.

01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:12.451
Nobody would have thought
to dump that meter.

01:57:14.152 --> 01:57:15.654
Not even me.

01:57:59.155 --> 01:58:01.157
You were wrong about my father.

01:58:03.159 --> 01:58:05.287
I wouldn't make a big thing of it.

01:58:22.637 --> 01:58:23.854
Who is he?

01:58:23.972 --> 01:58:25.519
That's John Doe Number Two.

01:58:25.682 --> 01:58:28.856
The man on the grassy knoll.
The thing under the bed.

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:31.693
They call him the Zec.

01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.199
Zec? Prisoner.

01:58:35.317 --> 01:58:36.694
What's your real name?

01:58:39.863 --> 01:58:41.615
I was born in October.

01:58:41.698 --> 01:58:44.042
When I get to my birthday,
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

01:58:44.367 --> 01:58:46.290
One. Two.

01:58:46.369 --> 01:58:49.999
Chelovek. Zec Chelovek.

01:58:51.708 --> 01:58:53.210
Chelovek?

01:58:53.877 --> 01:58:55.379
Chelovek? Human.

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.927
Prisoner Human Being.

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:03.395
- That's your real name?
- That is all I remember.

01:59:06.556 --> 01:59:08.024
Call the police.

01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:13.359
Were you really going to shoot him?

01:59:15.065 --> 01:59:16.908
I knew I wouldn't have to.

01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:21.906
One look at this guy and you know
he'll do anything to survive.

01:59:22.238 --> 01:59:24.411
One look at me
and you know I'm not bluffing.

01:59:24.699 --> 01:59:27.202
Yes, I have an emergency at...

01:59:28.078 --> 01:59:29.375
Yes, I'll hold.

01:59:33.083 --> 01:59:34.426
We're in no hurry.

01:59:37.045 --> 01:59:39.264
With a name like yours,
you're gonna feel right at home.

01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:42.263
Prison? In America?

01:59:42.759 --> 01:59:46.935
A retirement home.
If I go to prison at all.

01:59:47.055 --> 01:59:48.227
You think you're gonna walk?

01:59:48.431 --> 01:59:51.105
You are a homeless drifter
wanted for murder.

01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:55.780
Meanwhile, I am an old man
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:59:56.106 --> 02:00:00.202
Thanks to you,
who is left to say otherwise? Who?

02:00:00.276 --> 02:00:04.122
Yes, hello? Yes, there's...
I have an emergency.

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:06.287
We'll see which one of us
goes to prison.

02:00:06.449 --> 02:00:08.952
There are maybe
three, four people dead.

02:00:10.495 --> 02:00:11.963
- Okay.
- My bet?

02:00:13.623 --> 02:00:15.000
Neither one.

02:00:18.128 --> 02:00:19.675
What did you do?

02:00:24.134 --> 02:00:25.681
What's it look like?

02:00:27.429 --> 02:00:28.476
What about the truth?

02:00:28.972 --> 02:00:31.395
What about getting the guys
who really did this?

02:00:31.474 --> 02:00:33.476
What about bringing him to justice?

02:00:34.644 --> 02:00:36.271
I just did.

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.949
What about clearing Barr?
What about clearing you?

02:00:47.157 --> 02:00:48.797
I have faith you'll sort it out.

02:00:48.825 --> 02:00:50.668
And I hear you have an in
with the local D.A.

02:00:50.785 --> 02:00:53.004
But what happens to you
in the meantime?

02:00:53.163 --> 02:00:55.006
I keep moving. Same as always.

02:00:55.123 --> 02:00:57.296
Wait, is that my car?

02:01:04.257 --> 02:01:05.304
This the lady?

02:01:06.176 --> 02:01:08.349
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.

02:01:08.678 --> 02:01:09.804
A pleasure.

02:01:11.181 --> 02:01:13.354
You look like hell there, Army.

02:01:13.475 --> 02:01:17.150
You asked if I was afraid
I'd end up like Barr. I'm not.

02:01:17.353 --> 02:01:19.196
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.

02:01:19.314 --> 02:01:22.113
There's a lot of dead bodies out here.
So let's get to it.

02:01:22.192 --> 02:01:25.036
- We should probably go.
- Wait. That's it?

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:26.700
It's just over?

02:01:27.822 --> 02:01:29.540
You'll be all right, counsellor.

02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:32.373
No. What if I need you?
How will I find you?

02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:33.877
You don't need me.

02:01:35.497 --> 02:01:36.794
Not any more.

02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:40.718
Get her number. Let's go!

02:01:57.227 --> 02:01:59.229
I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.

02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:03.985
This conversation is protected
by attorney-client privilege.

02:02:04.067 --> 02:02:05.068
You understand what that means?

02:02:05.193 --> 02:02:06.240
Yeah.

02:02:06.319 --> 02:02:08.572
Now, the police didn't
talk to you, did they?

02:02:08.738 --> 02:02:10.581
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.

02:02:14.577 --> 02:02:16.250
How bad was it?

02:02:18.248 --> 02:02:19.591
How many did I...

02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:22.752
You don't remember
anything about the incident?

02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:27.428
No.

02:02:28.925 --> 02:02:32.099
But I could hear the nurses
talking to those cops out there.

02:02:36.266 --> 02:02:38.439
I don't even
remember wanting to do it!

02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.283
Look, I'm not gonna fight this.

02:02:46.776 --> 02:02:49.120
If they say I done it, then I did.

02:02:49.779 --> 02:02:51.452
I done things before.

02:02:54.117 --> 02:02:55.460
I did something bad.

02:02:58.121 --> 02:02:59.293
Real bad.

02:03:03.126 --> 02:03:04.799
A long time ago.

02:03:08.298 --> 02:03:09.971
And I got away with it.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:18.812
James,

02:03:19.142 --> 02:03:20.985
how well do you know this place?

02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.657
Pretty well.

02:03:34.324 --> 02:03:36.044
And how do you think
you would have done it?

02:03:39.495 --> 02:03:40.838
I guess

02:03:46.836 --> 02:03:48.838
I would have parked up on the highway.

02:03:49.297 --> 02:03:51.846
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.

02:03:53.509 --> 02:03:54.635
I got a van.

02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:57.643
Set up in back.

02:03:58.348 --> 02:04:00.692
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.

02:04:02.518 --> 02:04:04.520
Get away real clean, too.

02:04:08.024 --> 02:04:10.026
That sound about right?

02:04:11.527 --> 02:04:13.700
Sounds as if you know your stuff.

02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.037
I forget your name.

02:04:20.703 --> 02:04:22.046
It's Helen.

02:04:23.706 --> 02:04:25.049
Helen Rodin.

02:04:30.672 --> 02:04:32.845
You're going to be okay, James.

02:04:34.008 --> 02:04:35.726
I am gonna take care of you.

02:04:35.885 --> 02:04:37.387
You can't protect me.

02:04:40.682 --> 02:04:42.025
No one can.

02:04:42.225 --> 02:04:43.568
From what?

02:04:45.019 --> 02:04:46.066
From who?

02:04:47.563 --> 02:04:49.236
There's this guy.

02:04:52.902 --> 02:04:54.404
He's a kind of cop.

02:04:56.364 --> 02:04:58.037
At least he used to be.

02:04:59.242 --> 02:05:01.244
<i>He doesn't care about the</i> law.

02:05:02.912 --> 02:05:04.914
<i>He doesn't care about proof.</i>

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.758
<i>He only cares about what's right.</i>

02:05:08.084 --> 02:05:09.927
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

02:05:10.253 --> 02:05:11.755
<i>He knows what I did.</i>

02:05:13.715 --> 02:05:14.762
<i>He knows where I am.</i>

02:05:16.384 --> 02:05:19.263
<i>And this guy, he made me a promise.</i>

02:05:19.554 --> 02:05:20.601
- I said, shut your mouth!

02:05:21.764 --> 02:05:23.937
<i>If I ever got in trouble again,</i>

02:05:25.601 --> 02:05:26.944
<i>he'd be there.</i>
