<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:06.094 --> 00:08.929
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:08.964 --> 00:10.932
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:10.966 --> 00:12.299
<i>He has sanctioned

00:12.334 --> 00:15.035
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:15.069 --> 00:17.738
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:17.772 --> 00:19.340
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:19.374 --> 00:21.041
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:21.075 --> 00:22.642
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:22.676 --> 00:23.810
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:23.845 --> 00:25.780
This was an act of terrorism.

00:25.814 --> 00:28.183
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:28.217 --> 00:30.651
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:30.686 --> 00:31.786
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.289
...until something stops him.

00:34.324 --> 00:37.159
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:37.194 --> 00:40.829
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:42.132 --> 00:44.332
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:44.366 --> 00:48.102
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:54.743 --> 00:57.111
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:57.145 --> 00:59.113
Fuck!

00:59.147 --> 01:01.115
<i>I missed something once before.</i>

01:01.149 --> 01:03.951
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:05.186 --> 01:07.521
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:07.555 --> 01:09.055

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:23.304 --> 01:24.571
Why have I never
heard of this guy?

01:24.605 --> 01:26.073
Who? Quinn?

01:26.107 --> 01:27.174
Just check him out.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.709
- Please.
- Okay.

01:28.744 --> 01:31.078
I'm being asked to be part of
an attack on this country.

01:31.113 --> 01:32.880
I'm through.

01:32.914 --> 01:34.882
Brody just blew it up.
The whole operation's dead.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.351
As long as his cover isn't
blown, he's still in play.

01:37.386 --> 01:39.921
Brody. Give me the keys.
I'm trying to keep you

01:39.955 --> 01:42.190
from spending the rest
of your life in a cage.

01:43.959 --> 01:45.927
This deal of ours...

01:48.497 --> 01:51.199
...I think it's a way out
for both of us.

01:56.939 --> 01:58.673
Yes?

01:58.707 --> 01:59.907
I want to explain.

01:59.941 --> 02:01.275
I'm glad you feel that way.

02:02.310 --> 02:05.011
Turn around.
We're leaving.

02:05.046 --> 02:06.680
She knows.

02:06.714 --> 02:08.214
Tighten up the follow
vehicles now.

02:08.249 --> 02:09.382
We cannot afford to lose him.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.717
You say you want another chance.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.018
This is it.

02:15.088 --> 02:16.855
They just grabbed him.

02:16.890 --> 02:18.824
They're loading him
into a helicopter.

02:18.858 --> 02:20.325
We're losing him!

02:20.360 --> 02:21.593
Quinn?

02:21.627 --> 02:22.961
They're gone.

02:22.995 --> 02:26.097
They're... they're gone.
They're just gone!

02:34.639 --> 02:36.307
Go ahead, say it.

02:39.978 --> 02:42.579
It's 12 hours since
we lost Brody.

02:42.614 --> 02:45.215
Eight since
Roya Hammad got back

02:45.250 --> 02:47.384
from wherever they flew him to.

02:48.487 --> 02:51.155
No comment or second opinions

02:51.189 --> 02:53.090
about any of this
at Langley, either.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.160
Terrorist chatter
across all hot zones

02:56.195 --> 02:59.864
virtually nonexistent
right now.

03:06.972 --> 03:08.940
Okay, I'll say it.

03:11.477 --> 03:13.078
He's dead.

03:13.112 --> 03:14.613
We don't know that
for sure, Carrie.

03:14.647 --> 03:16.081
If not physically dead,

03:16.115 --> 03:18.250
operationally dead.

03:18.284 --> 03:19.685
And time's ticking away.

03:19.719 --> 03:21.287
We have to talk about moving on.

03:23.057 --> 03:26.159
The only move we have
is to roll up Roya Hammad.

03:28.228 --> 03:29.461
Unless Brody's not dead,

03:29.496 --> 03:31.530
and is somehow still in play
with the terrorists,

03:31.564 --> 03:34.066
in which case
lifting her burns him.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.768
Be his death sentence.

03:35.802 --> 03:37.869
That's a lot of ifs and maybes.

03:37.904 --> 03:39.805
Agreed.

03:39.839 --> 03:41.773
Just putting all the cards
on the table here.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.311
We've got to bring Roya in.

03:51.518 --> 03:53.919
Let's do it.

03:53.953 --> 03:55.955
Mike, can you do it?

04:01.362 --> 04:03.663
Don't, Saul.

04:03.698 --> 04:05.165
I'm okay.

04:43.171 --> 04:46.606
This is where we
say good-bye, Nicholas.

04:46.641 --> 04:49.710
Forever, if all goes well.

04:50.779 --> 04:54.014
You know I cannot
do this without you.

04:54.048 --> 04:55.582
Yeah.

04:55.617 --> 04:58.052
You have Allah's trust,

04:58.086 --> 05:01.255
and therefore mine.

05:01.289 --> 05:04.091
Allah knows more
than anyone can

05:04.126 --> 05:06.094
how strong you are.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.397
Pray for me.

05:09.431 --> 05:11.432
And you for me.

06:08.756 --> 06:10.090
Hey.

06:10.124 --> 06:12.392
Do you have a pay phone
I could use?

06:12.426 --> 06:14.227
Wait, do I know you
from somewhere?

06:14.262 --> 06:15.696
No, I don't think so.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.264
A pay phone?

06:17.298 --> 06:18.999
Not since last century.

06:19.034 --> 06:21.636
Well, do you have
a cell phone I could borrow?

06:25.641 --> 06:26.841
Hello?

06:26.876 --> 06:28.176
Hey. It's me.

06:28.210 --> 06:30.178
Jesus, where have you been?

06:30.213 --> 06:31.946
Carrie, I need you to go
get my family right away.

06:31.981 --> 06:33.114
Okay, and take them
somewhere safe.

06:33.149 --> 06:35.617
We've been going
out of our minds.

06:35.651 --> 06:36.651
I don't care where.

06:36.685 --> 06:37.919
I don't care what it takes.

06:37.953 --> 06:39.420
Can you please, please
do that for me right now?

06:39.455 --> 06:40.855
Yes. Where are you?

06:40.890 --> 06:42.223
What's been going on?

06:42.258 --> 06:45.027
I'll call you back in an hour,
once it's done.

06:47.229 --> 06:49.297
Well?

06:49.331 --> 06:51.433
Leave Roya in play.
Cancel the lift.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This man
has been off the radar

06:53.269 --> 06:55.270
the past 12 hours, in the
company of known terrorists.

06:55.304 --> 06:57.305
We need to be extremely
fucking vigilant here.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.841
Um...

06:59.875 --> 07:02.610
- Carrie?
- I... he asked me to...

07:02.644 --> 07:04.512
to move his family
somewhere safe.

07:04.546 --> 07:07.215
He's alive, asking us
to protect his family.

07:07.249 --> 07:08.983
That's a check mark
in the plus column.

07:09.018 --> 07:10.518
Carrie's right.
Stand down the lift team

07:10.552 --> 07:12.620
- on Roya Hammad.
- What number was Brody calling from?

07:12.654 --> 07:14.889
Uh, 443 area code--
a Baltimore cell.

07:14.923 --> 07:16.357
Run that number.

07:16.391 --> 07:17.891
He said he'd call
back in an hour,

07:17.925 --> 07:19.459
once the family's safe.

07:19.493 --> 07:20.894
If there's a threat to them,

07:20.928 --> 07:22.629
what happens next
has to look like

07:22.663 --> 07:24.030
just another day in the burbs.

07:24.064 --> 07:26.800
Yeah, no CIA footprint
anywhere near that neighborhood.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.135
Whoever we send in
has to be somebody

07:29.170 --> 07:30.703
the Brody family
knows and trusts.

07:35.576 --> 07:37.577
Shit.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.150
I'm coming.

07:46.921 --> 07:48.588
Mike.

07:48.622 --> 07:50.590
Jess, don't panic.
Please, just listen.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.092
Do as I say.
Everything's fine, but...

07:52.126 --> 07:53.092
Is it Brody?

07:53.127 --> 07:54.761
- Is he all right?
- No...

07:54.795 --> 07:57.563
- I haven't seen or heard from him in
two days. - The CIA sent me, Jess.

07:57.598 --> 07:59.365
- There's a threat.
- A threat?

07:59.399 --> 08:01.100
What threat? To us?

08:01.135 --> 08:02.602
Well, it's to do with
something Brody's working on

08:02.636 --> 08:04.404
with the CIA, or else it
would be him standing here.

08:04.438 --> 08:06.272
You mean like
a terrorist threat?

08:06.307 --> 08:07.273
It's not specific.

08:07.308 --> 08:09.108
This is just
a precaution, so...

08:09.143 --> 08:11.944
No school for you guys today.
You're going to come with me.

08:11.979 --> 08:13.112
We're coming with you where?

08:13.146 --> 08:14.113
Somewhere safe.

08:14.147 --> 08:16.915
Go get your brother.

08:16.950 --> 08:17.950
Hurry!

08:19.519 --> 08:21.220
This is bullshit.

08:27.994 --> 08:29.528
If my dad wants to move us,

08:29.563 --> 08:31.163
he can come here and
explain it himself.

08:31.198 --> 08:32.831
It's not your dad, Dana;
it's the CIA.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.299
They were the ones
who called me.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.601
Trust me, it's my dad.

08:35.635 --> 08:37.669
Everything that goes wrong
right now is my fucking dad,

08:37.703 --> 08:39.238
- so get out of my room, Mike!
- Hey!

08:39.273 --> 08:41.407
- Get...
- Hey! You don't talk to me like that.

08:41.442 --> 08:42.408
I'm here to help,

08:42.443 --> 08:43.909
and you damn well know it.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.645
I'm not asking,
and nor is the CIA,

08:45.679 --> 08:46.980
so get your shit together

08:47.014 --> 08:48.448
because it's happening,
and it's happening now,

08:48.482 --> 08:50.083
even if I have to
carry you out of here

08:50.117 --> 08:52.085
kicking and screaming.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.167
Hello.

09:07.201 --> 09:08.168
Are they safe yet?

09:08.202 --> 09:09.169
Yes.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.470
Where?

09:10.504 --> 09:12.038
Can't discuss that
on an open line.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.740
Remember where we first met?

09:13.774 --> 09:15.075
And I don't mean your office.

09:15.109 --> 09:16.810
In the rain?

09:16.844 --> 09:18.178
I'll see you there in 30.

09:28.923 --> 09:29.923
Come on.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.725
Shh.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.373
Let's go, man.
Let's go.

10:56.578 --> 10:58.679
The point is, until today,

10:58.713 --> 11:01.548
this look into Quinn that you
and Carrie asked us to do

11:01.582 --> 11:03.917
was feeling like
a big fucking jerk-off.

11:03.951 --> 11:05.585
Everywhere we looked,
he checked out.

11:05.619 --> 11:08.254
Till today?
What happened today?

11:08.289 --> 11:09.522
We tracked down where he lives.

11:09.557 --> 11:10.924
Took a peek into his apartment.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.559
Shit, Virgil.

11:12.593 --> 11:14.828
Told you to check him out,
not break into his apartment.

11:14.862 --> 11:16.563
Show him, Max.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.002
Anti-intrusion devices
everywhere.

11:22.037 --> 11:25.239
Man lives like he's ready
to bounce at a moment's notice.

11:29.945 --> 11:32.580
That's it?

11:32.614 --> 11:35.248
A CIA analyst is
a security-phobe?

11:35.283 --> 11:37.751
His personal life's
a little wanting?

11:37.785 --> 11:39.385
The field office
is one thing, Saul,

11:39.420 --> 11:41.487
but I've never met an analyst
that lives like this.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.090
Do you know what that is?

11:44.124 --> 11:46.092
It's a rifle-cleaning kit.

11:46.126 --> 11:48.594
That pull-through
cable tells me

11:48.628 --> 11:50.429
that it's a rifle
with a long-ass barrel.

11:50.463 --> 11:51.898
A sniper rifle.

11:55.970 --> 11:57.637
Anything else?

11:57.671 --> 11:59.472
One personal item.
We found it tucked away

11:59.507 --> 12:01.307
in the only book that he has.

12:01.342 --> 12:03.276
Her name's Julia Diaz.

12:03.310 --> 12:05.378
Easy to trace
because she's law enforcement.

12:05.413 --> 12:06.980
Philadelphia PD.

12:07.015 --> 12:09.149
Find out what precinct she's
in and get me the address.

12:15.657 --> 12:18.192
Whoa! This is sick.

12:18.226 --> 12:22.029
You're stocked up on groceries
and some half-decent wine.

12:22.063 --> 12:25.365
If you need anything else,
pick up that phone, hit one-one.

12:25.399 --> 12:27.867
We're in the apartments
on either side.

12:27.901 --> 12:31.037
Is there anything else you can
tell me about this threat?

12:31.072 --> 12:34.307
All I know is that your husband
is working with the CIA on it.

12:34.341 --> 12:36.009
It's standard procedure for us

12:36.043 --> 12:38.177
to move the families
of any high-profile people

12:38.212 --> 12:41.348
who are working on operations
like this to safe houses.

12:42.483 --> 12:44.985
Is there a specific threat

12:45.019 --> 12:46.486
to me and my children?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.988
Not that we know of, no.

12:48.022 --> 12:49.256
But we don't take chances.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.558
This is the most secure place
that you can be.

12:53.561 --> 12:55.095
Okay, Jess?

12:57.198 --> 12:58.965
There's a TV in every room.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.867
Every room?
No way.

13:00.901 --> 13:02.735
Yeah. They're all
big-screens, too.

13:13.447 --> 13:15.482
Hey.

13:15.516 --> 13:17.050
Where have you been, Brody?

13:17.084 --> 13:18.452
Where's my family?

13:18.486 --> 13:19.853
They're in DC, safe.

13:19.887 --> 13:21.488
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

13:21.522 --> 13:25.025
Of course.

13:26.694 --> 13:30.096
I thought I was dead, Carrie.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.667
It's really good to see you.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.311
Well, where did they take you
on that helicopter?

13:45.345 --> 13:46.312
I don't know.

13:46.346 --> 13:48.814
40, 45 minutes.

13:48.849 --> 13:50.850
Very fast, very low.

13:50.884 --> 13:52.552
West.

13:52.586 --> 13:53.886
And dark.

13:53.921 --> 13:55.221
Away from any signs
of civilization.

13:55.255 --> 13:57.690
We have to hone in
on all of the details now.

13:57.724 --> 13:59.024
Every little thing.

13:59.059 --> 14:00.492
I was taken to see Abu Nazir.

14:00.526 --> 14:02.561
- What?
- He's here.

14:02.595 --> 14:04.396
Carrie, he's here.
He's in America.

14:04.431 --> 14:05.898
And he's planning an attack.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.900
Wait... Abu Nazir?

14:07.934 --> 14:09.435
How is that even possible?

14:09.469 --> 14:11.504
Jesus Christ!

14:11.538 --> 14:15.207
So they wire you
to the car battery.

14:15.242 --> 14:17.110
What do you do?

14:17.144 --> 14:20.280
I told them to kill me now.

14:20.314 --> 14:23.483
Because...
whatever reason Nazir has

14:23.517 --> 14:27.254
to torture me again is...

14:27.288 --> 14:28.755
Fuck him.

14:28.789 --> 14:31.191
After all I've been
through, fuck him.

14:31.225 --> 14:32.859
You dared him to kill you

14:32.893 --> 14:34.160
right off the bat?

14:34.195 --> 14:35.695
Yeah.

14:38.632 --> 14:41.234
Then what happens?

14:41.268 --> 14:42.568
They leave me there.

14:42.603 --> 14:46.004
They don't turn on the battery.

14:46.038 --> 14:47.873
I just sit there
for a couple hours--

14:47.907 --> 14:49.074
three maybe,
I don't know--

14:49.108 --> 14:50.075
sweating it out.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.443
Then finally the door opens,

14:51.477 --> 14:53.945
and Nazir walks through
with tea.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.081
Tea?

14:56.115 --> 14:58.417
Yeah, the threat of torture
was a test.

14:58.451 --> 15:00.820
And I think this was, too.

15:00.854 --> 15:06.326
We have become unsure of
your commitment to our mission.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.727
"Our mission"?

15:07.761 --> 15:10.763
I don't know anything
about a mission.

15:10.798 --> 15:12.766
I did exactly
what was asked of me--

15:12.800 --> 15:14.467
nothing more, nothing less.

15:14.501 --> 15:17.304
You saved my life in Beirut.

15:17.338 --> 15:19.406
No one asked you to do that.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.244
What is it, Nicholas?

15:24.278 --> 15:27.414
What is troubling you?

15:27.448 --> 15:31.419
I wanted to avenge Issa's death,

15:31.453 --> 15:33.788
not kill innocent civilians.

15:33.822 --> 15:37.592
What if it's the will of Allah?

15:37.626 --> 15:40.095
Neither of us know
the will of Allah.

15:40.129 --> 15:43.599
You taught me that yourself.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.969
Each of us must decide
what we can or cannot do.

15:47.003 --> 15:50.139
So now you must decide.

15:50.173 --> 15:52.674
What is your will, Nicholas?

15:52.709 --> 15:54.677
<i>I tell him my will</i>

15:54.711 --> 15:57.045
is close to breaking.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.848
Did he ask

15:59.882 --> 16:02.718
about your recent...

16:04.720 --> 16:07.522
...specific wavering
with Roya Hammad?

16:07.557 --> 16:08.890
Yes.

16:08.925 --> 16:10.926
And?

16:10.960 --> 16:14.429
I told him I'd underestimated
the love I have for my family.

16:16.766 --> 16:18.734
And the fear for
what would become of

16:18.768 --> 16:20.969
my wife and kids
after I was gone

16:21.004 --> 16:24.073
had blindsided me.

16:24.107 --> 16:27.910
How did Nazir react to
your concern about your family?

16:36.786 --> 16:38.854
Your wife and children

16:38.889 --> 16:42.691
have nothing to fear...

16:42.726 --> 16:46.229
if you stay true to yourself.

16:47.998 --> 16:50.366
A clear threat.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.335
Did he ask you anything else?

16:52.369 --> 16:54.670
No.

16:54.705 --> 16:56.172
Did he say how he got

16:56.206 --> 16:57.874
- into the country?
- No.

16:57.908 --> 16:59.576
Did he say about the why of it?

16:59.610 --> 17:01.912
My choice was simple...

17:01.946 --> 17:06.715
run, hide and wait for death
like a cowering animal,

17:06.751 --> 17:09.386
like Bin Laden;

17:09.420 --> 17:12.288
or die taking the fight
to the enemy.

17:14.791 --> 17:17.260
And the specifics

17:17.294 --> 17:19.295
of this fight are?

17:21.298 --> 17:23.531
Tomorrow afternoon, the
vice president and I

17:23.567 --> 17:26.602
are scheduled to greet the
Special Operations group

17:26.636 --> 17:28.237
returning from Afghanistan.

17:28.271 --> 17:29.805
At Dam Neck Naval Base.

17:29.839 --> 17:34.210
300 soldiers to be reunited
with their families.

17:34.244 --> 17:37.880
Nazir plans
to hit the homecoming.

17:37.915 --> 17:39.515
How the hell
is he gonna do that?

17:39.549 --> 17:41.083
It's a locked-down,
classified event.

17:41.118 --> 17:42.952
All I know is what he told me.

17:42.986 --> 17:44.854
He said he can't
do it without me.

17:44.888 --> 17:46.422
He said I'm essential
to his plan.

17:46.457 --> 17:49.558
And your essential part
in this attack is what?

17:51.595 --> 17:54.063
To convince the vice president

17:54.097 --> 17:58.034
to allow one reporter
to cover the event.

18:00.305 --> 18:02.773
Roya Hammad.

18:02.807 --> 18:04.407
Yes.

18:08.012 --> 18:11.014
Is there anything else?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.850
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

18:21.692 --> 18:23.660
No.

18:23.695 --> 18:25.028
That's it.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.435
Wait here, please.

18:31.469 --> 18:32.736
Let's go.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.214
<i>Thoughts?</i>

18:43.248 --> 18:44.415
Peter.

18:44.449 --> 18:46.217
I don't know.
It all feels too easy.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.652
He could be lying;
Nazir could be playing him

18:48.686 --> 18:50.688
to misdirect us,
lead us into a trap.

18:50.722 --> 18:52.156
Saul.

18:52.191 --> 18:54.425
It's possible.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.894
By his own admission,
Brody's in a confused state.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.929
Spent 12 hours
in the company of a man

18:58.963 --> 19:00.297
who has considerable power
over him.

19:00.332 --> 19:02.233
What do you think, Carrie?

19:03.935 --> 19:06.971
I think the symbolism of
murdering 300 American soldiers

19:07.005 --> 19:08.639
in front of
their wives and children

19:08.674 --> 19:10.207
is quintessential Nazir.

19:10.242 --> 19:12.677
It's an idea worthy of him.

19:12.711 --> 19:16.180
Elite troops just back
from killing Muslims

19:16.214 --> 19:17.682
on the battlefield,
just when they think

19:17.716 --> 19:19.150
they're out of harm's way?

19:19.184 --> 19:23.221
So, with that in mind,

19:23.255 --> 19:25.523
if Nazir is planning to use
Roya Hammad to breach the base,

19:25.558 --> 19:26.758
what are we looking at?

19:26.792 --> 19:28.092
There's that trunk
of explosives

19:28.126 --> 19:30.561
they pulled out of
the tailor shop in Gettysburg.

19:30.596 --> 19:33.431
What, 'cause that'd be as simple
as replacing her news crew

19:33.465 --> 19:36.735
with terrorists and launching
a Mumbai-style attack?

19:36.769 --> 19:38.770
Uh, or a combination of the two.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.105
Bottom line is

19:40.139 --> 19:42.607
we can't not
follow up on this, David.

19:42.642 --> 19:45.710
Nazir is in our sights.

19:45.745 --> 19:49.080
We have to play this out.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.960
They don't believe me.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.962
In 90 minutes,
the vice president

20:03.996 --> 20:06.597
will be in your office,
at which point David Estes will

20:06.632 --> 20:08.766
brief the two of you
on these latest developments.

20:08.801 --> 20:12.570
He'll protect your deeper
involvement, of course,

20:12.605 --> 20:15.006
and you'll do your best
to look surprised.

20:18.043 --> 20:20.011
Do you believe me?

20:23.215 --> 20:26.117
I do.

20:26.151 --> 20:29.720
Because that's all
I care about right now.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.832
Different phone, same number.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.938
Think you're the only one
who understands

20:46.972 --> 20:49.306
this fucker needs watching
like a hawk?

20:49.341 --> 20:51.641
How about Carrie?

20:51.676 --> 20:53.476
She understand that, too?

20:53.511 --> 20:56.245
Want to call your family?

20:56.280 --> 20:57.780
No.

20:57.814 --> 20:59.782
I'll just have to lie
to Jessica again.

20:59.816 --> 21:02.317
They're in good hands,
though, right?

21:02.352 --> 21:03.819
Sure.

21:03.853 --> 21:06.154
And tomorrow, all of
this will be over.

21:06.188 --> 21:08.189
Right.

21:10.192 --> 21:11.959
What's that look?

21:11.994 --> 21:13.895
I thought it would be
easier for them

21:13.929 --> 21:15.663
if they were with
someone they knew.

21:18.334 --> 21:20.035
Let me guess...
Mike Faber.

21:23.039 --> 21:25.708
Your call?

21:25.743 --> 21:27.744
My call.

21:30.481 --> 21:33.216
Smart.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.386
I thought so.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.057
Is Dad in the CIA now?

21:41.091 --> 21:43.059
Is he going to have
to leave again?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.226
I don't think so.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.195
All we know is that
he's helping them

21:46.229 --> 21:49.132
with something for now;
it'll be finished soon.

21:51.168 --> 21:53.136
They playing?

21:54.372 --> 21:57.341
You know what, honey?
Can you do me a favor?

21:57.375 --> 22:00.511
Go set the table for
dinner while we wait.

22:00.545 --> 22:03.381
Go on.

22:06.852 --> 22:08.152
I understand
you're angry, Dana.

22:08.186 --> 22:09.554
I'm not angry at you.

22:09.588 --> 22:10.655
In general, then.

22:10.689 --> 22:12.356
Hey, I'm mad
at Brody, too, Dana.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.492
I can only imagine
what it's like for you.

22:19.731 --> 22:22.700
You know, sometimes...

22:22.734 --> 22:25.202
I really just wish
he had never come back

22:25.236 --> 22:26.203
from that stupid war.

22:26.237 --> 22:27.204
Don't say that.

22:27.239 --> 22:28.539
I mean, ever since

22:28.573 --> 22:30.408
he's gotten back,
everything has gone to shit,

22:30.442 --> 22:32.744
and it just keeps getting worse.

22:32.778 --> 22:34.078
We all come back

22:34.113 --> 22:36.147
from that war
with some kind of wound.

22:42.555 --> 22:44.523
Did you?

22:44.557 --> 22:45.858
Sure.

22:45.892 --> 22:48.860
For eight years, I thought
I lost my best friend.

22:50.830 --> 22:53.064
It's like I left him behind
back there.

22:53.099 --> 22:54.432
Table's set, Mom.

23:12.052 --> 23:13.619
- David.
- Sir.

23:13.653 --> 23:14.620
Nick.

23:14.654 --> 23:15.654
Sir.

23:15.689 --> 23:17.156
Little unorthodox.

23:17.190 --> 23:18.824
Mr. Vice President,
we have a situation

23:18.858 --> 23:20.459
that concerns both you
and the congressman,

23:20.493 --> 23:23.028
and not a lot of time.

23:23.062 --> 23:25.898
A few hours ago, we received
intelligence from two separate

23:25.932 --> 23:27.299
sources in Beirut that

23:27.333 --> 23:29.334
Abu Nazir's terrorist network
is planning to attack

23:29.369 --> 23:32.337
the Special Operations group
homecoming at Dam Neck tomorrow.

23:35.174 --> 23:37.142
We've got to divert
the transport,

23:37.176 --> 23:38.343
cancel the event.

23:38.378 --> 23:40.011
Sir, we believe,
with your help,

23:40.046 --> 23:42.214
we have an extremely
high-percentage shot at killing

23:42.248 --> 23:44.716
or capturing the terrorist cell
and stopping the attack cold.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.118
With my help?

23:47.152 --> 23:49.187
This is right in
your wheelhouse, sir.

23:49.221 --> 23:50.755
I'm listening.

23:50.789 --> 23:53.190
It all hangs
on the CNB correspondent

23:53.224 --> 23:55.693
Roya Hammad.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.362
I know her, know her well.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.897
She's interviewed
me several times.

23:59.931 --> 24:02.065
Sir, we believe
she's working with Abu Nazir.

24:02.099 --> 24:03.767
What?

24:03.801 --> 24:05.635
Based on verbal information
from the same assets

24:05.669 --> 24:07.036
on the ground in Beirut.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.571
Roya Hammad's a terrorist?

24:08.605 --> 24:10.606
We believe,

24:10.640 --> 24:12.308
strongly,

24:12.342 --> 24:14.543
that not only is Ms. Hammad
the delivery mechanism

24:14.577 --> 24:16.845
for this attack,
whatever form it may take,

24:16.880 --> 24:19.615
but that she also intends
to film it

24:19.649 --> 24:21.517
for broadcast around the world.

24:28.191 --> 24:29.892
What do you need from me, David?

24:29.926 --> 24:32.795
Officially allow her
the access she's requesting

24:32.829 --> 24:34.363
so that we can monitor
her movements,

24:34.397 --> 24:36.365
catch the entire cell
red-handed

24:36.399 --> 24:38.567
and roll them up before
the attack can actually happen.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.902
Where's the White House on this?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.104
I'll leave that with you, sir.

24:41.138 --> 24:42.271
I'll take care of the director.

24:44.008 --> 24:46.442
What do you think, Nick?

24:46.477 --> 24:49.112
One question, sir.

24:49.146 --> 24:51.615
What happens if
the plan goes wrong?

24:51.649 --> 24:54.084
If this isn't done and dusted

24:54.118 --> 24:56.820
before you leave the residence
for that base tomorrow morning,

24:56.855 --> 24:58.889
then we divert the troop
transport and cancel the event.

24:58.924 --> 25:01.392
Which, I assume, would
blow your entire operation.

25:01.427 --> 25:03.228
Yeah.

25:03.262 --> 25:06.665
Sir, there is one more thing.

25:06.699 --> 25:08.033
What?

25:08.067 --> 25:09.301
We have good reason to believe

25:09.335 --> 25:10.936
that Abu Nazir is here,

25:10.970 --> 25:13.071
in the United States.

25:13.106 --> 25:14.373
How the fuck did that happen?

25:14.407 --> 25:15.607
That can't go further

25:15.641 --> 25:17.475
than this room,
Mr. Vice President.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.782
Get me these terrorists, David.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.650
Yes, sir.

25:33.358 --> 25:34.992
Make the call. Do it now.

25:42.701 --> 25:44.201
Hello?

25:44.236 --> 25:45.503
It's me.

25:45.537 --> 25:47.438
Vice president said yes.

25:47.472 --> 25:49.340
How did you manage
to convince him?

25:49.374 --> 25:51.208
I told him that if he wants

25:51.242 --> 25:53.677
to officially nominate me
as his running mate,

25:53.712 --> 25:54.979
then there'd be
no better time and place

25:55.013 --> 25:56.380
to do it than at the naval base

25:56.414 --> 25:57.514
in front
of the returning troops.

25:57.549 --> 25:58.548
Very clever.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.651
Our friend will be pleased.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.919
Good.

26:01.953 --> 26:03.187
Nicholas?

26:03.221 --> 26:04.956
When the plane lands
at the base,

26:04.990 --> 26:06.758
I'll be with my cameraman.

26:06.792 --> 26:08.693
You should find a way
to be with me.

26:08.728 --> 26:11.496
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

26:11.531 --> 26:13.065
Yes, I do.

26:13.099 --> 26:14.600
See you tomorrow.

26:19.939 --> 26:21.540
That's a bomb.

26:21.574 --> 26:24.210
She just told him how to stay
out of the blast radius.

26:24.244 --> 26:25.578
Stay with the cab.

26:25.612 --> 26:28.580
I want all eyes and ears on her
until this thing's over.

26:30.617 --> 26:33.052
We'll alternate
in six-hour shifts.

26:33.086 --> 26:34.219
I'll take the first one.

26:34.254 --> 26:36.221
That leaves me
with the doom watch.

26:56.042 --> 26:58.744
Okay, so congruent triangles.

26:58.778 --> 27:01.413
Have you ever heard of
the Donkey Theorem?

27:01.447 --> 27:03.281
Okay, give me the book.

27:03.315 --> 27:05.316
We'll look at it.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.257
The capital city

27:13.291 --> 27:14.892
of the most powerful country
in the world.

27:14.926 --> 27:16.827
Yep.

27:16.862 --> 27:19.530
The shit that
goes on out there.

27:21.567 --> 27:24.268
Thank you.

27:24.303 --> 27:26.437
For being here.

27:34.545 --> 27:35.946
That woman was right.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.247
This is only half-decent.

27:40.852 --> 27:42.786
So, I figured you'd take
the guest room.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.721
Oh, I'm good
with the living room couch.

27:44.755 --> 27:47.257
Take the guest room.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.259
The kids will come in with me.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.902
You called for me, sir?

27:57.936 --> 27:59.804
Officer Diaz?

27:59.838 --> 28:01.039
And you are?

28:01.073 --> 28:02.273
Richard Keller.

28:02.308 --> 28:03.408
Good to meet you, Officer.

28:03.442 --> 28:05.243
What can I do for you
today, Mr. Keller?

28:05.278 --> 28:06.678
Richard, please.

28:06.712 --> 28:08.814
Is there somewhere
we could speak in private?

28:08.848 --> 28:10.482
What about?

28:10.517 --> 28:12.885
Your son.

28:14.487 --> 28:17.023
Actually, it's more
about his father,

28:17.057 --> 28:19.292
John Sr.

28:19.326 --> 28:21.694
Who are you?

28:21.728 --> 28:23.729
Really?

28:27.234 --> 28:28.601
IRS?

28:28.635 --> 28:30.370
Come with me.

28:33.874 --> 28:37.677
I haven't seen John
since John Jr. was born,

28:37.711 --> 28:39.712
so that's four years.

28:40.714 --> 28:43.483
But he sends you money?

28:43.517 --> 28:46.352
Am I right?

28:48.022 --> 28:49.989
I've upset you.

28:54.329 --> 28:55.462
I'm sorry.

29:00.135 --> 29:02.503
Occupational hazard.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.742
I'm a cop, sir, not a moron

29:07.776 --> 29:09.076
or a criminal.

29:09.111 --> 29:10.344
So if you're looking to find

29:10.379 --> 29:12.680
some tax beef on me,
write me a letter.

29:12.715 --> 29:14.516
I can go get myself a lawyer,

29:14.550 --> 29:15.851
and we can do this right.

29:15.885 --> 29:18.220
Maybe it's not with you
that we have a discrepancy.

29:18.254 --> 29:20.456
Maybe it's with your husband.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.191
We were never married.

29:22.225 --> 29:25.494
Does he have anything
to do with your son?

29:27.163 --> 29:29.131
Does that have anything
to do with you?

29:31.935 --> 29:34.503
If, uh...

29:34.538 --> 29:38.274
if you could give me
John's last name,

29:38.308 --> 29:41.010
for the record.

29:41.045 --> 29:42.545
Sure.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.181
I can confirm it for you.

29:45.215 --> 29:48.151
It means you go first.

29:48.185 --> 29:51.054
Understood the meaning.

29:51.088 --> 29:53.790
And since we're, uh,

29:53.824 --> 29:56.526
being all open and honest here,

29:56.560 --> 29:59.529
Richard, how does the IRS

29:59.564 --> 30:02.331
get that picture
of me and my kid?

30:11.174 --> 30:13.642
Has something happened to him?

30:13.677 --> 30:16.511
What is this all about?

30:21.851 --> 30:23.751
You're not IRS, are you?

30:30.658 --> 30:34.261
If you'd like to check
my credentials,

30:34.295 --> 30:36.296
be my guest.

30:53.714 --> 30:57.250
Well, I'm sorry
to bother you, Officer.

31:07.796 --> 31:09.797
Have a good night.

31:20.376 --> 31:22.177
You watching him?

31:22.211 --> 31:24.279
He's at his station,
doing his thing.

31:24.314 --> 31:26.315
John X, aka Peter Quinn,

31:26.349 --> 31:28.851
is about to get a call
from the mother of his child.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.460
Hello?

31:45.238 --> 31:47.238
What did he look like, this man?

31:50.075 --> 31:52.043
No.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.745
No, don't worry about it.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.150
You did fine.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.356
I got to go.

32:16.536 --> 32:18.537
Is Carrie still here?

32:18.571 --> 32:20.505
Yeah.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.040
I got to go deal

32:22.074 --> 32:24.376
with some personal
admin bullshit for 30 minutes.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.777
Can you cover for me?

32:25.812 --> 32:28.580
Me, cover for you?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.615
It's 30 minutes--
no big deal.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.651
Sure, not a problem.

32:51.471 --> 32:53.739
You got him?

32:53.773 --> 32:55.574
He took a bus.

32:55.609 --> 32:57.910
East.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.397
He's a slippery bastard.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.566
He just got off.
He, uh...

33:20.600 --> 33:23.402
he ditched his jacket
and put on a hat.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.277
Now he's getting on another bus.

34:07.348 --> 34:09.949
He's, um...

34:09.984 --> 34:11.985
he's talking to someone.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.954
Hmm.

36:46.874 --> 36:48.542
Where have you been?

36:48.576 --> 36:49.843
You look wasted.

36:49.878 --> 36:51.478
I'm just old.

36:54.682 --> 36:57.951
You'll get there
sooner than you think.

37:06.594 --> 37:09.028
See you at game time.

37:18.605 --> 37:21.540
Max is on him.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.209
So he met some guy
on a city bus?

37:34.053 --> 37:36.487
You know him?

37:36.522 --> 37:37.922
Dar Adal.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.557
Dar Adal?

37:39.592 --> 37:40.959
That's Dar Adal?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.495
That's him.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.065
In the flesh.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.000
I knew him 18 years ago,

37:49.034 --> 37:51.636
when I ran company missions
we don't talk about

37:51.671 --> 37:55.173
into Somalia,
from Nairobi Station.

37:55.207 --> 37:57.809
If Quinn reports to a guy
like Dar Adal,

37:57.843 --> 38:01.112
he's no more an analyst
than I'm in Hair Club for Men.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.247
So what's he really doing
on this task force?

38:05.050 --> 38:07.251
I don't know.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.300
You're early.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.801
You're welcome.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.770
FBI liaison,
two operations officers

38:58.804 --> 39:00.171
from the Special Ops group.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.506
The rest is in the memo.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.707
Carrie already in position?

39:02.741 --> 39:03.975
Since 6:00 a.m.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.476
Along with two follow teams

39:05.510 --> 39:07.144
across from
Roya Hammad's building.

39:07.179 --> 39:08.979
Waiting for her
to get on the move.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.547
- Tac team?
- Two blocks off.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.449
We sure it's just
Roya in this cell?

39:12.483 --> 39:14.518
What about the other three
in the, uh, news team?

39:14.552 --> 39:15.986
Here she comes.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.954
Apart from a DWI
and a minor drug charge,

39:17.989 --> 39:19.956
they check out,
but until we know for sure,

39:19.991 --> 39:21.491
everyone's a terrorist.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.059
We're moving.

39:23.093 --> 39:24.427
Black Town Car.

39:24.462 --> 39:27.796
Plate number L484K7.

39:27.831 --> 39:29.565
We got eyes on her news van?

39:29.599 --> 39:30.799
Rolling follow team.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.034
The camera crew just pulled in

39:32.069 --> 39:33.570
to a restaurant two miles
north of Dam Neck.

39:33.604 --> 39:34.904
Van's clean so far.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.681
Morning.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.483
How is everybody today?

39:45.518 --> 39:47.052
Holding up.

39:47.086 --> 39:49.020
- Right, guys?
- Guess what.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.122
I just got clearance for you
to give Congressman Brody

39:51.157 --> 39:52.457
a call on the satellite phone.

39:52.492 --> 39:54.192
He could probably
use a call now,

39:54.227 --> 39:55.994
and we figured you'd
want to check in

39:56.028 --> 39:57.796
and let him know
that you're all doing fine.

39:57.831 --> 39:59.665
Okay, great.

39:59.699 --> 40:01.666
Just family talk, though.

40:01.701 --> 40:04.236
"Hi. How are you?"
That sort of thing.

40:04.270 --> 40:06.171
No mention of the CIA, please.

40:18.284 --> 40:19.417
Hello?

40:19.452 --> 40:20.585
Hey, Dad.

40:20.620 --> 40:21.887
It's me, Chris.

40:21.921 --> 40:24.022
He knows it's you, dorko.

40:24.057 --> 40:25.390
What's going on?

40:25.425 --> 40:26.692
Just eating breakfast.

40:26.726 --> 40:29.495
Uncle Mike made
huevos rancheros.

40:30.563 --> 40:32.731
Great. Say hi to him.

40:32.766 --> 40:35.034
Dad says hi.

40:36.203 --> 40:38.771
So, uh, are we getting
out of here soon?

40:38.806 --> 40:40.206
Sure, real soon.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.041
This place is so cool.

40:42.076 --> 40:43.409
Hey, listen, that's great.

40:43.444 --> 40:44.877
I'm just running out to work.

40:44.912 --> 40:47.346
Can I have a quick word
with your sister?

40:47.381 --> 40:48.681
Sure.

40:48.715 --> 40:49.782
Bye, Dad.

40:49.817 --> 40:51.584
Bye, Chris.

40:59.594 --> 41:01.361
Talk to your father.

41:01.396 --> 41:02.596
Dana!

41:04.799 --> 41:06.133
Brody.

41:06.167 --> 41:07.267
Hey.

41:07.302 --> 41:08.569
You okay?

41:08.603 --> 41:10.371
Yeah, I'm fine, Jess.
Where's Dana?

41:11.940 --> 41:13.440
I don't want to.

41:13.475 --> 41:14.775
She's, um...

41:14.810 --> 41:17.044
still sleeping.

41:19.148 --> 41:20.915
Well, give her a kiss for me.

41:20.950 --> 41:22.150
Yeah.

41:22.184 --> 41:24.319
Tell her I love her.

41:24.354 --> 41:26.054
She knows.

41:27.557 --> 41:28.857
What about you?

41:28.892 --> 41:30.225
You okay?

41:32.028 --> 41:33.428
Brody, can you tell me

41:33.462 --> 41:35.730
anything about
what's happening,

41:35.764 --> 41:37.232
what you're doing?

41:37.266 --> 41:38.466
Only that I'm glad

41:38.500 --> 41:39.667
you guys are safe.

41:39.701 --> 41:42.236
And it's all going to be
over real soon,

41:42.270 --> 41:44.771
and we'll get back
to the way we were.

42:09.129 --> 42:11.497
She's entering the restaurant.

42:20.740 --> 42:23.041
She's at a window counter
with her camera crew,

42:23.075 --> 42:25.576
where she has a line of sight
with the news van.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.778
Looks like she's
ordering breakfast.

42:37.423 --> 42:39.257
Where's he going?

42:40.326 --> 42:42.493
Liaison with the FBI
in the field.

42:43.529 --> 42:45.129
FBI liaison?

42:45.164 --> 42:47.064
An analyst?

42:48.100 --> 42:49.767
He's wearing two hats today.

42:49.802 --> 42:51.135
Go.

42:55.307 --> 42:57.275
All call sites, stand by.

42:58.344 --> 43:00.145
<i>Possible bogey.</i>

43:00.179 --> 43:02.781
Wait out. Wait out.

43:12.559 --> 43:14.160
Blue SUV.

43:14.194 --> 43:15.695
Fits the description of the one

43:15.729 --> 43:18.031
Brody saw Sandman
get into yesterday.

43:18.065 --> 43:20.000
Unknown number of passengers.

43:20.034 --> 43:21.402
Is Nazir in it?

43:21.436 --> 43:23.103
I can't tell.
The windows are tinted.

43:23.138 --> 43:25.006
I can't see inside.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.542
Now they're just
sitting there, waiting.

43:27.576 --> 43:30.278
Who's really running
this operation, David?

43:30.312 --> 43:32.246
Excuse me?

43:32.281 --> 43:34.816
You or Dar Adal?

43:34.850 --> 43:36.417
And Quinn.

43:36.451 --> 43:38.486
Who is he really?

43:38.520 --> 43:40.388
What are his orders?

43:43.458 --> 43:46.294
He's here
to kill terrorists, Saul.

43:46.328 --> 43:49.096
Just like all of us.

43:50.332 --> 43:51.766
Stand by.
There's movement.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.835
Okay. Okay.

43:57.472 --> 43:59.440
The first person
out of the vehicle

43:59.474 --> 44:00.775
is Nazir's munitions guy.

44:00.809 --> 44:02.109
Stand by.

44:04.446 --> 44:07.048
And three I don't recognize.

44:07.082 --> 44:10.117
One more still in the van
who I can't see.

44:13.255 --> 44:16.724
They're opening the back
of the news van.

44:18.627 --> 44:21.829
They're moving what looks
like camera batteries.

44:23.265 --> 44:25.066
Now they're doing something
at the rear

44:25.101 --> 44:26.835
of the vehicle
which I-I can't see.

44:37.479 --> 44:40.748
They're switching
the camera batteries.

44:49.692 --> 44:52.127
If that's the device,
it's at least 200 pounds.

44:52.161 --> 44:55.830
Tac One, Tac Two,
Tac Three, move now. Over.

45:09.679 --> 45:11.680
Show me your hands! FBI!

45:11.715 --> 45:13.115
<i>Bogey on the move.</i>

45:13.150 --> 45:14.517
<i>Intercept.</i>

45:23.427 --> 45:25.562
Got him.

45:27.999 --> 45:31.401
Going in to confirm it's Nazir.

45:45.652 --> 45:47.053
Stand by.

45:47.087 --> 45:49.622
Waiting for confirmation
of Nazir.

46:13.581 --> 46:15.815
Show me his face.

46:21.589 --> 46:24.191
It's not him.
It's-it's not Abu Nazir.

46:24.226 --> 46:26.394
It's not him.
Sandman is not here.

46:26.428 --> 46:28.596
We do not have Sandman.

46:34.737 --> 46:35.737
Stand down.

46:35.771 --> 46:37.405
You still need him.
I say again--

46:37.439 --> 46:38.740
stand down.

46:40.142 --> 46:42.777
What the hell
are you doing here?

46:43.913 --> 46:45.747
Watching your back.

46:45.781 --> 46:47.749
We got them, Brody.

46:47.783 --> 46:49.551
Your information was good.

46:50.686 --> 46:52.454
Got them all?

46:52.488 --> 46:53.688
All but Nazir.

46:53.723 --> 46:55.056
He's still out there.

46:55.090 --> 46:56.958
So, believe it or not,

46:56.992 --> 46:59.260
I am your best friend
in the world right now.
