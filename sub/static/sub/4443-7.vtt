WEBVTT

00:00.099 --> 00:01.815
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.900 --> 00:03.120
This is awkward.

00:03.134 --> 00:05.435
I don't have anymore money
if that's what you mean.

00:05.469 --> 00:06.569
Sarah we haven't heard from you yet.

00:06.604 --> 00:08.738
I think my third foster home's a match.

00:08.773 --> 00:10.740
The Olmsteads have really gone out
of their way to make me feel welcome.

00:10.775 --> 00:13.643
- I saw your shots on Instagram.
- What do you want?

00:13.677 --> 00:15.545
I'm gonna say this once:

00:15.579 --> 00:17.781
Stop asking questions and
stay the hell away from Sarah.

00:17.815 --> 00:19.449
Do you think our moms
are telling the Riveras

00:19.483 --> 00:20.784
- they bought Lexi the pill?
- What?

00:20.818 --> 00:22.652
Lexi wanted my help getting
the morning-after pill

00:22.686 --> 00:24.454
after she and Jesus had sex.

00:24.488 --> 00:27.290
I knew that you felt a
responsibility to Lexi's parents

00:27.324 --> 00:28.691
because you are her Vice Principal.

00:28.759 --> 00:31.628
- I did it so that you did not have to.
- How generous.

00:31.662 --> 00:35.365
Mari, Jesus is gonna join us
at church retreat next weekend.

00:35.399 --> 00:36.566
- Why don't you come?
- What?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.335
You're gonna let them
spend the night together

00:39.370 --> 00:41.304
when you know they're having sex?

00:42.506 --> 00:44.407
Save it, Mariana, I don't want to hear it.

00:44.442 --> 00:46.242
You're a freakin' tattletale.

00:46.277 --> 00:47.610
You're like some hurt little
girl on the playground.

00:47.645 --> 00:49.679
"Jesus and Lexi had
sex and I feel left out,

00:49.713 --> 00:51.247
so I'm gonna tell on them."

00:51.282 --> 00:53.283
It's the same thing you guys did to me.

00:53.317 --> 00:54.617
Yeah, what world is that the same thing?

00:54.652 --> 00:56.219
You guys were sneaking around

00:56.253 --> 00:57.520
behind my back, lying to me.

00:57.555 --> 00:59.522
Because we knew you were
gonna get your feelings hurt.

00:59.557 --> 01:01.424
No. You knew what you
were doing was messed up,

01:01.459 --> 01:02.559
or you wouldn't have been hiding it.

01:02.593 --> 01:05.161
Don't lie, Jesus. You know
it's exactly the same thing.

01:05.196 --> 01:06.563
If that's the way it's gonna
be, if we're keeping score now,

01:06.597 --> 01:09.299
maybe I should just tell moms
who you've been talking to.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.467
Jesus, shut up.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.268
I think they'd be very interested to know

01:12.303 --> 01:13.470
you've been giving Anna money.

01:13.504 --> 01:16.172
That would just get you in
trouble, too, and you know it.

01:16.207 --> 01:18.074
What do I care? What are
they gonna do, ground me?

01:18.108 --> 01:20.176
The only person I wanna see is Lexi,

01:20.211 --> 01:21.444
and her parents won't let her talk to me.

01:21.479 --> 01:22.545
Sucks, doesn't it?

01:22.580 --> 01:24.481
I haven't been able to
talk to her for weeks.

01:24.515 --> 01:27.083
Hey! That is enough, you two!

01:27.117 --> 01:29.486
You guys are gonna have to figure this out.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.055
For better or for worse, you're a family,

01:32.089 --> 01:33.356
and you're gonna have to
find a way to get along.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.225
No one on this Earth
can get along with her,

01:35.259 --> 01:36.493
not even the Dalai freakin' Lama

01:36.527 --> 01:39.295
could get along with a monster like her.

01:44.101 --> 01:45.435
I'm sorry to say this, babe,

01:45.469 --> 01:47.270
but you kind of brought this on yourself.

01:47.304 --> 01:50.273
Drinking like that and
outing your brother and Lexi

01:50.307 --> 01:53.142
to her parents was, uh,

01:53.177 --> 01:55.111
that was really none of your business.

01:55.145 --> 01:58.047
I can't believe you're taking their side.

01:58.082 --> 01:59.315
You might as well adopt Lexi.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.317
You like her so much better than me.

02:07.157 --> 02:10.226
That is not true and you know it.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.195
We love you more than anything.

02:12.229 --> 02:16.299
We just don't love the
way you've been acting.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.202
Is this really who you wanna be?

02:20.971 --> 02:22.272

03:16.110 --> 03:18.111
So what's up?

03:18.145 --> 03:21.247
Well, I got a call
yesterday from Dr. Kodema.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.883
- The therapist?
- From your group, yes.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.985
And she expressed some concern

03:26.020 --> 03:28.955
that while you have been
showing up every week,

03:28.989 --> 03:32.158
you haven't really been participating.

03:32.192 --> 03:34.994
Yeah. Um...

03:35.029 --> 03:36.929
I was gonna ask you, actually...

03:36.964 --> 03:38.197
Yeah.

03:38.232 --> 03:39.999
Can we, maybe, find another group?

03:40.034 --> 03:41.901
Why? Don't you like Dr. Kodema?

03:41.935 --> 03:43.202
Yeah, she's ok.

03:43.237 --> 03:46.272
It's just... the kids.

03:46.306 --> 03:50.076
I don't know, I don't
feel... very comfortable.

03:50.110 --> 03:51.978
Huh. Ok.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.247
Well, I can talk to Bill about it,

03:54.281 --> 03:58.885
but therapy is one of the
terms of your probation.

03:58.919 --> 04:01.187
So until we can get
something else worked out,

04:01.221 --> 04:03.890
- you're gonna have to...
- Keep going.

04:03.924 --> 04:05.191
Yeah.

04:05.225 --> 04:07.226
Ok.

04:27.014 --> 04:29.782
- Hey, do you want some?
- Mnh-mnh.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.788
Is there juice?

04:51.972 --> 04:54.807
Are you, like, not
talking to me or something?

04:54.842 --> 04:56.809
No. Why?

04:56.844 --> 04:58.878
I don't know, 'cause you're
kind of not talking to me.

05:00.047 --> 05:01.814
Hmm.

05:06.086 --> 05:07.820
Did I do something?

05:07.855 --> 05:10.022
I don't know. Um, you took my sister

05:10.057 --> 05:12.759
to a rager and got her drunk.

05:12.793 --> 05:15.828
First of all, I didn't take
Mariana anywhere. She took me.

05:15.863 --> 05:18.030
She took you? To Wyatt's party?

05:18.065 --> 05:20.767
Yeah. She was whining about being around

05:20.801 --> 05:22.902
when Lexi and her parents came over.

05:22.936 --> 05:27.173
And second, I told her not
to drink, and she ignored me.

05:27.207 --> 05:31.811
So if you wanna be pissed at
someone, take it up with her.

05:34.782 --> 05:35.882
Oh.

05:35.916 --> 05:37.884
Sorry.

05:37.918 --> 05:39.952
It's fine, don't worry about it.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.655
I just thought that maybe...

06:17.925 --> 06:20.626
A lot better.

06:20.661 --> 06:22.895
I've been clean for like a week now.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.698
- That's great.
- Yep.

06:25.732 --> 06:28.601
And there's this place that I can go,

06:28.635 --> 06:31.604
this treatment center,

06:31.638 --> 06:33.639
to stay that way.

06:33.674 --> 06:36.809
- Wow.
- The problem is,

06:36.844 --> 06:38.845
I can't afford it.

06:41.515 --> 06:44.584
I wish I could help, but I don't...

06:44.618 --> 06:45.818
I don't have any more money.

06:45.853 --> 06:49.822
No, if you don't have
any cash, that's cool.

06:49.857 --> 06:52.558
I mean, there probably is
something at your house,

06:52.593 --> 06:55.428
something that you guys don't use,

06:55.462 --> 06:57.430
something that your moms wouldn't miss.

06:57.464 --> 07:00.266
And then you can give that
to me and I could sell it.

07:01.435 --> 07:04.437
I just really want to get better, you know?

07:04.471 --> 07:06.639
I, um, I don't think I can...

07:06.673 --> 07:10.243
It's just, we're family,

07:10.277 --> 07:11.544
you know,

07:11.578 --> 07:14.647
and family takes care of family.

07:32.361 --> 07:36.264
So I woke up in the middle
of a dream about you,

07:36.298 --> 07:39.267
and I'm not gonna lie,
it was kind of dirty,

07:39.301 --> 07:42.203
and anyway I was thinking things,

07:42.238 --> 07:45.340
and I went online to look
at your sweet pics again

07:45.374 --> 07:48.176
but when I got there,
your account was private.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.078
Yeah, you know, I just...

07:50.112 --> 07:54.949
I suddenly realized that, like,
anyone can see it, you know.

07:56.218 --> 07:58.086
Don't worry about it.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.956
This doesn't have anything to do
with that Liam douche, does it?

08:03.259 --> 08:05.293
I could tell he kind of
freaked you out at the party

08:05.327 --> 08:07.929
and then I saw that comment he made

08:07.963 --> 08:10.999
on the shot of the tree.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.235
And I thought, "Is he flirting with her?

08:14.270 --> 08:16.871
Is he threatening her?"

08:16.906 --> 08:21.142
No. No, um, he was just kidding.

08:21.176 --> 08:23.811
Oh, he's hilarious, then.

08:24.980 --> 08:28.182
No. He's just got like a
weird sense of humor, I guess.

08:28.217 --> 08:31.152
So who is he? How do you know him?

08:31.186 --> 08:33.988
Why? You want to date him?

08:34.023 --> 08:37.725
Yeah. Yeah, he's totally my type.

08:38.961 --> 08:40.828
So...

08:40.863 --> 08:43.932
He's just some guy I used to know.

08:43.966 --> 08:45.066
Ok?

08:48.938 --> 08:50.939
Hey. Have you seen Lexi?

08:50.973 --> 08:52.040
Sorry, babe.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.142
Have you heard from her, anything?

08:54.176 --> 08:55.977
Oh, better get to class

08:56.011 --> 08:57.845
before you get someone else pregnant.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.013
I didn't...

09:01.684 --> 09:03.651
Forget it.

09:03.686 --> 09:05.987
And I think it'll be
best if we work in pairs,

09:06.021 --> 09:08.690
that'll make it easier with two of you.

09:08.724 --> 09:11.659
So, everybody needs to pick a partner.

09:18.801 --> 09:20.601
- Do you have a... ?
- No.

09:20.636 --> 09:22.704
Do you want to be mine?

09:22.738 --> 09:25.873
How about I come over on Saturday?

09:25.908 --> 09:27.875
My mom doesn't like it when kids come over.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.711
She says it gives her migraines.

09:29.745 --> 09:31.779
Yeah, ok.

09:31.814 --> 09:34.682
I mean, I have to ask, but...

09:34.717 --> 09:36.017
Ok. Well, let me know.

09:36.051 --> 09:38.953

You're not mad at me?

10:04.630 --> 10:05.730
Of course not.

10:05.764 --> 10:06.831
Oh my God, why would I be mad at you?

10:06.866 --> 10:08.733
My parents took away
my computer and my phone

10:08.767 --> 10:10.435
and I couldn't figure
out a way to reach you,

10:10.469 --> 10:12.604
- and I just thought...
- Are you ok?

10:12.638 --> 10:16.541
It's awful. My mom cries
every time she looks at me.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.476
You're kidding?

10:18.510 --> 10:21.746
No. My dad hasn't talked
to me since that night.

10:21.780 --> 10:25.650
Is this why you haven't been in school?

10:38.330 --> 10:40.331
Was that the, um... ?

10:40.366 --> 10:42.500
What were the Riveras doing here?

10:44.370 --> 10:46.337
They're pulling Lexi out of school.

10:47.573 --> 10:50.575
Oh my God. They shouldn't...

10:50.609 --> 10:52.510
they are completely overreacting.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.245
Are they?

10:54.280 --> 10:56.414
Because they're under the
impression that you gave Lexi

10:56.448 --> 10:59.450
emergency contraception without
their consent or knowledge.

10:59.485 --> 11:02.320
I tried to assure them that
couldn't possibly be the case

11:02.354 --> 11:04.455
seeing as it's school policy
that we do not administer

11:04.490 --> 11:07.492
so much as an aspirin
without parental notice.

11:07.526 --> 11:11.229
But they seemed pretty certain.

11:11.263 --> 11:13.264
Did they... ?

11:13.299 --> 11:16.100
Are they planning on going to the Board?

11:16.135 --> 11:17.535
Not that they mentioned.

11:17.569 --> 11:20.471
But if they're angry enough
to pull Lexi out of school...

11:28.147 --> 11:30.281
- I hope you're happy.
- What?

11:30.349 --> 11:33.151
You've ruined her life 'cause you're
so freakin' pathetic and jealous.

11:33.185 --> 11:34.485
What are you talking about?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.989
Lexi. They're sending her to
a boarding school in Texas.

11:38.023 --> 11:40.291
All thanks to you.

11:40.326 --> 11:43.227
Way to take care of the people you love.

11:51.403 --> 11:54.238
Hey. I'm headed home, but, uh,

11:54.273 --> 11:57.008
you know, I could take the long way.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.177
I'm waiting for Wyatt, so...

11:59.211 --> 12:01.045
Oh. Cool.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.848
All right, I'll see you at home then.

12:03.882 --> 12:05.049
Yeah, see you at home.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.224
I thought I told you to shut the hell up!

12:13.258 --> 12:16.027
I didn't... what do you... ?

12:16.061 --> 12:17.996
Your little boyfriend just
sent me a threat online.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.797
Well, I wonder where he got that idea.

12:19.832 --> 12:21.833
- What'd you tell him.
- I didn't tell him anything.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.869
Leave me alone. Ow! Liam, let me go.

12:24.903 --> 12:26.204
I'm not gonna warn you again.

12:26.238 --> 12:29.007
Stay away from me, and
stay away from Sarah,

12:29.041 --> 12:33.111
and tell your freak of a boyfriend
to keep his mouth shut or else...

12:35.147 --> 12:37.115
Hey, stop it!

12:37.149 --> 12:39.017
Wyatt, let him go!

12:42.121 --> 12:43.788
Liam, enough!

12:43.822 --> 12:46.791
Hey! Get...

12:46.825 --> 12:48.026
- Hey!
- Come on!

12:48.060 --> 12:51.963
Hey! Get the hell out of here!

13:06.011 --> 13:08.646
Stay away from Callie!
If I ever see you again...

13:08.680 --> 13:09.814
Shut up!

13:11.717 --> 13:12.884
I told you to stay out of it,

13:12.918 --> 13:14.652
and now you've just made things worse.

13:14.686 --> 13:17.889
- I was just trying to...
- Go home, Wyatt.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.694
Fine. You want me to stay out of it,

13:23.729 --> 13:25.830
I'll stay out of it for good.

13:43.196 --> 13:45.997
So you wanna tell me
what that was all about?

13:46.032 --> 13:48.200
I mean, who was that guy?

13:48.234 --> 13:50.001
And why was he fighting with Wyatt?

13:52.104 --> 13:54.806
That was Liam.

13:54.841 --> 13:57.742
The foster brother you told me about?

13:59.912 --> 14:01.046
How old is he, though?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.715
I mean, he looks like he was... 30.

14:03.749 --> 14:05.083
He's 20.

14:05.117 --> 14:08.753
I guess he's 21 by now.

14:08.788 --> 14:13.625
I figured he'd be, you know, more our age.

14:13.659 --> 14:14.960
And how long ago was this?

14:14.994 --> 14:18.697
I mean, when you guys were together?

14:18.731 --> 14:20.765
Like a year or two.

14:22.034 --> 14:24.836
So he was like 19 and you were...

14:30.910 --> 14:32.777
That's not cool, Callie.

14:34.747 --> 14:37.582
You know that, right? That
what he did wasn't cool.

14:37.617 --> 14:38.984
I guess.

14:40.786 --> 14:44.856
What's really not cool, though, is, uh,

14:44.891 --> 14:47.559
there's this girl, Sarah,

14:47.593 --> 14:50.662
she's younger than us,

14:50.696 --> 14:53.665
and she's living with his family,

14:53.699 --> 14:57.869
and, um, I'm pretty sure...

15:07.647 --> 15:09.648
I'm not sure you're
listening to me here, Stef.

15:09.682 --> 15:11.416
My job could be in jeopardy.

15:11.450 --> 15:13.785
Ok, I hear you. But what
I don't understand is why.

15:13.819 --> 15:15.687
I gave Lexi the pill, not you.

15:15.721 --> 15:17.789
Let's hope the Parent
Board sees it that way.

15:17.823 --> 15:19.724
- They're going to the Board?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

15:19.759 --> 15:21.660
But you didn't do anything. I don't...

15:21.694 --> 15:23.461
Yes, but you did.

15:23.496 --> 15:25.697
And everything that you do
comes back on me. We're partners.

15:25.731 --> 15:27.499
I was trying to protect you,

15:27.533 --> 15:28.767
and I was trying to protect Lexi.

15:28.801 --> 15:31.503
She needed help.

15:31.537 --> 15:33.572
She's been like a daughter to us, Lena.

15:33.606 --> 15:35.307
Yes, but she's not our daughter,

15:35.341 --> 15:36.675
which is why we shouldn't have done it.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.743
Ok, I am sorry that things
have gotten so messy,

15:38.778 --> 15:42.614
I really am, but I don't
think I did anything wrong.

15:42.648 --> 15:44.583
Lexi would have gone to her parents

15:44.617 --> 15:47.285
if she felt safe enough
to do so, and she didn't.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.454
So it came down to us. You
didn't want to do anything...

15:49.488 --> 15:51.289
I couldn't do anything.

15:51.324 --> 15:54.259
I'm sorry. You couldn't
do anything, so I did.

15:54.293 --> 15:56.561
I did the right thing.

15:58.264 --> 16:00.565
Hi, honey. What's up?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.201
Hey. I can come back.

16:03.235 --> 16:05.437
No, no, no. It's fine.
It's fine. We're fine.

16:05.471 --> 16:07.238
Ok.

16:07.273 --> 16:10.308
So, we have this assignment in school

16:10.343 --> 16:13.411
where we have to build
a model of DNA or RNA.

16:13.446 --> 16:14.446
Uh-huh.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.281
Those are the things that make up genes.

16:16.315 --> 16:18.550
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh.

16:18.584 --> 16:21.219
So, we have to work in pairs,

16:21.253 --> 16:26.358
and I was wondering if my friend
Connor could come over tomorrow.

16:26.392 --> 16:29.160
Oh. Is that it?

16:29.195 --> 16:31.463
- Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
- Of course.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.198
Hey, do you want a snack?

16:33.232 --> 16:35.233
It's gonna be a little while till dinner.

16:35.267 --> 16:38.069
I don't really like to eat between meals.

16:41.207 --> 16:43.074
Never met a kid who didn't like a snack.

16:43.109 --> 16:46.211
I'm glad he's making friends.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.215
Listen, I am happy to talk to the Riveras.

16:50.249 --> 16:52.350
No, absolutely not.

16:52.385 --> 16:53.985
Karina made it more than clear

16:54.020 --> 16:55.286
that I am not to engage with them at all,

16:55.321 --> 16:58.089
- and that means you, too.
- This is ridiculous.

16:58.124 --> 17:01.092
It might be ridiculous,
but this is my career, Stef.

17:01.127 --> 17:03.061
It is my career.

17:03.095 --> 17:05.230
You know what? Never mind. Never mind.

17:05.263 --> 17:07.232
We gotta start dinner.

17:10.169 --> 17:11.869
Mr. Rivera...

17:11.904 --> 17:13.204
I've got nothing to say to you.

17:13.239 --> 17:15.040
Then just listen to me.

17:15.074 --> 17:16.875
You've got a lot of nerve showing your face

17:16.909 --> 17:18.042
after what you did.

17:18.077 --> 17:21.046
I know. I'm sorry. We made a mistake.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.281
- I wish I could take it back.
- Well, you can't.

17:23.315 --> 17:26.151
Come on. Haven't you ever
made a mistake before?

17:26.185 --> 17:27.852
Yes, trusting you with my daughter.

17:41.801 --> 17:43.968

Yeah, well, I gotta sleep sometime,

17:47.106 --> 17:49.808
so guess I'm out of luck.

18:40.793 --> 18:42.660
Lena, the Riveras are here!

18:43.763 --> 18:45.730
Come on in.

18:49.902 --> 18:51.803
Hello.

18:51.837 --> 18:55.473
Is, um... is Lexi here?

18:56.575 --> 18:59.544
- No.
- Are you sure?

18:59.578 --> 19:01.780
Yeah, the kids are all still sleeping.

19:01.814 --> 19:03.414
Why?

19:03.449 --> 19:05.750
Because when we woke up
this morning, she was gone.

19:07.419 --> 19:10.755
She had packed a bag... and she was gone.

19:20.647 --> 19:22.648
So you haven't seen her?

19:22.682 --> 19:24.650
No. I just woke up.

19:24.684 --> 19:25.851
Are you sure?

19:25.886 --> 19:27.853
- Yeah, I swear.
- Ok.

19:27.888 --> 19:30.556
Maybe... Should I go and look for her?

19:30.590 --> 19:32.424
No, no, no. You stay put.

19:32.459 --> 19:34.760
But if you think of anywhere
she might be, you let us know.

19:38.531 --> 19:40.666
- He knows something.
- I don't think so.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.701
He's never been a very good liar.

19:45.672 --> 19:48.374
- What's going on?
- Have you seen Lexi?

19:48.408 --> 19:50.776
Not since the other day. Why?

19:50.810 --> 19:54.513
- She ran away.
- When?

19:54.547 --> 19:57.583
Sometime last night.
We're not exactly sure.

19:57.617 --> 20:00.452
Well, I'm sure she hates me now,

20:00.520 --> 20:02.588
so I doubt I'll hear from her,

20:02.622 --> 20:05.557
but I'll let you know if I do.

20:08.028 --> 20:09.629
__

20:10.764 --> 20:14.600
It's not from her. I'm sorry.

20:14.634 --> 20:16.702
You know what? We can
track Lexi's cell phone.

20:16.736 --> 20:18.604
No.

20:18.638 --> 20:20.706
We took it away.

20:20.740 --> 20:24.510
Ok. Um...

20:24.544 --> 20:29.348
I think that we should file
a police report. I really do.

20:29.382 --> 20:31.483
Let's look for her first.

20:31.518 --> 20:32.618
She's probably at a friend's house,

20:32.652 --> 20:34.353
or maybe she went to the school.

20:36.289 --> 20:40.392
Ok. Then how about, Ernie,
you and I go looking for her.

20:40.427 --> 20:42.194
We'll check the school and the beaches,

20:42.228 --> 20:43.495
any of her usual hangouts.

20:43.530 --> 20:45.197
Sonia, you and Lena can stay here

20:45.231 --> 20:47.633
and make phone calls to her classmates.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.568
I have contact numbers
for the whole school.

20:49.602 --> 20:52.471
That way if she does come
here looking for Jesus,

20:52.505 --> 20:55.541
one of you will be here to talk to her.

20:55.575 --> 20:58.510
- Ok.
- Ok.

21:06.519 --> 21:08.387
Hey. How'd you sleep?

21:10.357 --> 21:12.057
Not great.

21:14.260 --> 21:18.330
So, I was, uh, I was thinking,
maybe you should call Bill.

21:20.066 --> 21:23.335
Why am I gonna call my social worker?

21:23.370 --> 21:25.237
Well, you know, to tell him about Liam.

21:25.271 --> 21:27.172
No. It won't do any good.

21:27.207 --> 21:29.375
I mean, it'll be my word against his,

21:29.409 --> 21:31.076
and he'll just deny it.

21:31.111 --> 21:34.079
But, I mean, it'll at
least be like a red flag

21:34.114 --> 21:36.048
or something, right?

21:36.082 --> 21:38.017
Here's the thing.

21:38.051 --> 21:42.087
Um, if I go in and tell Bill what happened,

21:42.122 --> 21:46.291
it won't just be about Liam,
it'll to on my record, too.

21:48.128 --> 21:51.363
If I admit to having
any kind of relationship

21:51.398 --> 21:54.967
with a foster brother, even a kiss,

21:55.001 --> 21:59.838
it goes in my file and I get
put in the high-risk category.

21:59.873 --> 22:04.043
And if they decide that I am...

22:04.077 --> 22:07.146
you know, sexually volatile,

22:07.180 --> 22:10.883
then they could put me in a group home.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.785
And once you become one of those kids,

22:12.819 --> 22:14.053
you never get fostered again.

22:16.122 --> 22:18.791
I mean, that's crazy, though.

22:18.825 --> 22:21.927
It's the system.

22:25.832 --> 22:26.932
So what about Sarah?

22:39.813 --> 22:42.848
- What?
- Nothing. I was just...

22:42.882 --> 22:44.750
Look, if you came in here
to give me another lecture

22:44.784 --> 22:47.086
about what a horrible
person I am, don't bother.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.856
I got the message. Now, excuse me.

22:57.864 --> 22:59.731
So she's not at the school.

22:59.766 --> 23:02.568
We'll check the beaches where
the kids hang out, all right?

23:02.602 --> 23:03.969
Sounds good.

23:04.003 --> 23:05.771
I don't know why I'm checking.

23:05.805 --> 23:07.606
She doesn't even have her phone.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.609
Well, you never know, she
might borrow one, or...

23:10.643 --> 23:11.810
We're gonna find her, Ernie.

23:11.845 --> 23:14.746
We're gonna find her. I promise, ok?

23:14.781 --> 23:15.948
Thanks.

23:17.784 --> 23:19.685
She's just so stubborn.

23:19.752 --> 23:21.887
Most teenagers are.

23:21.921 --> 23:25.524
It's their job, I think.

23:25.558 --> 23:27.860
Oh. Not Lexi, my wife.

23:29.796 --> 23:33.432
She gets so angry and
there's no talking to her.

23:33.466 --> 23:35.767
She's not alone in that.

23:35.802 --> 23:38.504
Sending Lexi away, really?

23:39.839 --> 23:42.808
So, you don't...

23:42.842 --> 23:46.512
Of course she needs to be protected, but...

23:46.546 --> 23:47.646
So why are you?

23:47.680 --> 23:51.383
Sonia wants to send Lexi
to live with her aunt,

23:51.417 --> 23:52.851
in Honduras.

23:54.654 --> 23:56.655
But I had to remind her
why left in the first place.

23:56.689 --> 23:58.290
There's so much violence.

23:58.324 --> 24:01.727
Sending Lexi back there to keep her safe...

24:01.761 --> 24:06.398
well, that just doesn't make much sense.

24:06.432 --> 24:09.268
A boarding school was a
compromise we could both live with.

24:13.406 --> 24:15.641
Ok. Ok, thank you.

24:15.675 --> 24:18.510
Thank you. Good-bye.

24:28.388 --> 24:30.289
I know you're angry with us.

24:31.424 --> 24:33.225
And I get it, I do.

24:33.259 --> 24:36.195
But I just... I wanted you to know

24:36.229 --> 24:38.664
that we didn't condone
Lexi and Jesus having sex.

24:41.201 --> 24:43.569
And we taught our kids about safe sex

24:43.603 --> 24:46.205
and about birth control,
so I can't believe...

24:46.239 --> 24:48.307
And yet you say you didn't condone it?

24:48.341 --> 24:52.344
Look, the reality is teenagers have sex.

24:52.378 --> 24:54.413
Dealing with that, it's...

24:54.447 --> 24:57.282
well, it's different than
giving them a big thumbs-up.

24:57.317 --> 24:59.151
But why put those thoughts in their heads,

24:59.185 --> 25:01.253
why, when they're 15?

25:01.287 --> 25:04.156
Ok. Regardless of our differences,

25:04.190 --> 25:06.258
we should have never given Lexi that pill.

25:06.292 --> 25:08.327
And... I'm sorry.

25:16.236 --> 25:19.204
Oh. Hey... come on in.

25:22.242 --> 25:25.043
Jude, Connor's here!

25:25.078 --> 25:27.079
So how's your Saturday?

25:27.113 --> 25:29.414
Pretty good. We won our soccer game.

25:29.449 --> 25:31.283
Very nice.

25:31.317 --> 25:34.052
- Hey.
- Hey, Jude.

25:34.087 --> 25:36.188
The Beatles!

25:36.222 --> 25:39.057
It's a band that old people like.

25:39.092 --> 25:41.326
Ok, ouch.

25:41.361 --> 25:44.329
Why don't you guys head up
to your room and get started.

25:44.364 --> 25:46.131
Jude has everything you should need.

25:46.165 --> 25:48.033
Come on.

26:01.281 --> 26:04.116
Hello.

26:08.187 --> 26:10.188
It's Mariana.

26:18.031 --> 26:20.065
I brought the stuff.

26:21.267 --> 26:22.801
Hey.

26:24.037 --> 26:25.137
Hey.

26:37.859 --> 26:40.227
Thanks.

26:40.262 --> 26:43.064
Your parents were at my house this morning,

26:43.098 --> 26:45.766
- looking for you.
- What did they say?

26:45.801 --> 26:47.168
Not much.

26:47.202 --> 26:51.772
They think Jesus knows
something, but not me.

26:51.807 --> 26:54.709
You know, since we're not talking.

26:57.713 --> 27:00.781
I don't have to stay here too long, right?

27:00.816 --> 27:03.951
I don't know. It's up to you.

27:03.985 --> 27:06.821
I guess as long as I
miss my flight tomorrow,

27:06.855 --> 27:09.990
well, maybe that will give
my parents time to calm down.

27:11.126 --> 27:13.594
They seemed pretty scared.

27:19.935 --> 27:21.969
This place is gross.

27:22.003 --> 27:23.938
Sorry. It was the only
place I could think of

27:23.972 --> 27:25.573
at the last minute.

27:25.607 --> 27:26.774
No, I...

27:26.808 --> 27:28.743
it's great.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.545
So what's been going on with you?

27:31.580 --> 27:34.682
Well, I saw Anna yesterday.

27:34.716 --> 27:35.850
I thought you were done with that.

27:35.884 --> 27:38.853
I just feel bad for her.

27:38.887 --> 27:42.857
Anyway, she asked me for money, again.

27:42.891 --> 27:44.892
And then she said the most
screwed up thing to me.

27:44.926 --> 27:46.994
She said, "We're family

27:47.028 --> 27:49.897
and family takes care of family."

27:51.767 --> 27:53.701
It's too bad they let Tomlinson go.

27:53.735 --> 27:55.569
They haven't been the same since.

27:55.637 --> 27:57.772
They were so close to the Super Bowl.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.508
Who's your favorite player?

28:00.542 --> 28:04.645
Oh. Uh... I like, you know,

28:04.679 --> 28:07.448
uh... what's his name?

28:08.717 --> 28:11.685
Actually, it's not mine.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.821
It's Jesus'.

28:13.823 --> 28:17.725
Oh, that's cool.

28:17.759 --> 28:19.627
Do you board?

28:20.662 --> 28:22.563
That's Jesus' too.

28:22.597 --> 28:25.566
Pretty much everything in here is Jesus'.

28:27.469 --> 28:29.370
Where's all your stuff?

28:29.404 --> 28:32.640
I don't really have that much stuff.

28:32.674 --> 28:34.642
When you move around all the time,

28:34.676 --> 28:37.645
things get lost or stolen.

28:37.679 --> 28:40.481
So this is pretty much it.

28:46.588 --> 28:48.656
Everybody has too much stuff anyway.

28:48.690 --> 28:51.625
I mean, like Zack? All he talks about is

28:51.660 --> 28:53.561
I got this new thing this weekend.

28:53.595 --> 28:56.230
It's stupid, right? He's such a jerk.

28:56.264 --> 28:58.165
Right?

29:02.537 --> 29:06.373
Hey, you don't ever talk
bad about anybody, like ever.

29:06.408 --> 29:09.176
Even those guys who
called you names and stuff,

29:09.211 --> 29:12.146
you never say anything mean about them.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.514
What's the point?

29:15.183 --> 29:17.484
We should probably get started.

29:17.519 --> 29:19.520
Oh my God! Hot!

29:19.554 --> 29:22.323
And give it to me.

29:24.125 --> 29:27.027
Model face.

29:27.062 --> 29:30.297
Oh, my God, this is so Vogue,
you being all hot in this dump.

29:30.332 --> 29:33.200
- Ooh! That's a good one.
- Let me see!

29:34.402 --> 29:36.470
Oh my God, that's terrible.

29:36.504 --> 29:39.006
You have to delete that.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.408
Actually, I should probably
delete all of these.

29:41.443 --> 29:44.011
Just in case someone sees
my phone or something.

29:46.047 --> 29:47.414
So...

29:49.184 --> 29:52.086
What was it like?

29:52.120 --> 29:56.357
You know, having sex, I mean.

29:56.391 --> 29:59.059
Well, you know how everybody says

29:59.094 --> 30:01.228
your first time isn't that great?

30:01.263 --> 30:03.998
Well, that's not exactly right.

30:04.032 --> 30:07.201
I mean, it's sort of great and...

30:07.235 --> 30:09.003
sort of awful

30:09.037 --> 30:11.906
and kind of weird, I guess.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.308
I mean, Jesus was super gentle...

30:14.342 --> 30:17.311
Ok. Mnh-mnh. You can't say his
name. You're grossing me out.

30:17.345 --> 30:21.048
Sorry. He was super gentle,

30:21.082 --> 30:22.917
and... I don't know.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.085
It did make me feel really close to him.

30:27.055 --> 30:31.025
Are you guys, you know, gonna do it again?

30:31.059 --> 30:33.127
I don't think so.

30:33.161 --> 30:35.229
At least not now, anyway.

30:37.098 --> 30:40.000
I should probably get home.

30:40.035 --> 30:42.036
Are you gonna be ok here by yourself?

30:42.070 --> 30:44.238
Yeah.

30:44.272 --> 30:49.777
Thank you for... all of this.

30:49.811 --> 30:52.746
Hey, we may not have
the best accommodations,

30:52.781 --> 30:55.950
but you're always welcome at Hotel Mariana.

31:07.062 --> 31:09.063
Here goes nothing.

31:13.935 --> 31:15.703
I told you to stay away from me.

31:15.737 --> 31:18.639
Look, I just need to talk to
you, Sarah, just for a minute.

31:18.673 --> 31:20.007
Leave me alone.

31:24.612 --> 31:26.814
Can I show you something?

31:30.752 --> 31:32.619
It was my dad's.

31:32.654 --> 31:34.855
It doesn't open anymore,

31:34.889 --> 31:37.725
but I just like the fact
that he carried it around.

31:39.861 --> 31:41.595
Yeah.

31:41.629 --> 31:43.931
Hey, what happened to your dad?

31:45.667 --> 31:47.668
He's in jail.

31:50.772 --> 31:52.573
Well, he was in jail,

31:52.607 --> 31:54.508
but then he had to leave the country

31:54.542 --> 31:58.579
and now he lives in, um, on an island.

31:58.613 --> 31:59.947
Oh, ok.

31:59.981 --> 32:01.915
He made a lot of money
and some people got mad,

32:01.950 --> 32:03.817
so he had to leave.

32:03.852 --> 32:05.786
But he'll come back and get us.

32:05.820 --> 32:07.788
And he's gonna take us
to his really nice house,

32:07.822 --> 32:09.556
and it's right on the beach,

32:09.591 --> 32:12.526
and there's a pool and
these really awesome cars.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.495
And that's where all my stuff is at,

32:14.529 --> 32:15.662
at my dad's.

32:15.697 --> 32:17.498
Why are you lying?

32:17.532 --> 32:19.666
- I'm not.
- You don't have to lie.

32:20.702 --> 32:22.870
I just...

32:22.904 --> 32:25.572
Sorry.

32:25.607 --> 32:28.776
Hey, you wanna play Ridge Racer?

32:28.810 --> 32:32.446
You go first.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.715
Whoa, this is  cool.

32:42.857 --> 32:45.793
I know that this is not
something you want to hear,

32:45.827 --> 32:48.395
but we need to file a police report

32:48.430 --> 32:49.596
and we need to file it now.

32:49.631 --> 32:51.598
Time is everything and we
need as many people out there

32:51.633 --> 32:52.666
looking for her as possible.

32:56.538 --> 32:59.473
Is something going on?

32:59.507 --> 33:01.742
Um, well, yes, I guess.

33:01.776 --> 33:04.711
Um, we didn't go to the
police because, um...

33:07.682 --> 33:09.450
because we're undocumented.

33:11.486 --> 33:13.487
- Wait, you're...
- Illegal.

33:13.521 --> 33:15.255
We are illegal immigrants.

33:23.676 --> 33:25.243
What's up?

33:25.277 --> 33:26.578
The Riveras are still here.

33:26.612 --> 33:29.247
What? Why?

33:29.281 --> 33:32.183
They're about to file a police report.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.286
Why? Lexi just ran away, right?

33:35.321 --> 33:37.589
I don't know. I think.

33:37.623 --> 33:40.592
I mean, she can't get in
trouble with the police

33:40.626 --> 33:42.460
for that, can she?

33:42.495 --> 33:44.596
If they find her, that could
be the least of her problems.

33:46.499 --> 33:49.601
Lexi?

33:57.243 --> 34:00.178
Wait. Why did you bring him here?

34:00.212 --> 34:01.446
You gotta come back with us.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.381
No way. I'm not gonna go home

34:03.415 --> 34:05.550
just so my parents can send
me to some boarding school.

34:05.584 --> 34:08.585
You have to.

34:08.621 --> 34:11.156
Because your parents are undocumented.

34:12.525 --> 34:14.525
And there's something else.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.161
You're undocumented too.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.136
So I guess that's good, right?

34:25.170 --> 34:27.605
It sounds like they want to adopt me.

34:27.639 --> 34:31.141
I think that's very good, Alex.

34:31.177 --> 34:33.478
And I'm very happy for you.

34:33.512 --> 34:37.315
So who would like to share next?

34:40.286 --> 34:43.321
Callie? Would you like to?

34:51.463 --> 34:53.464
A little while ago,

34:53.498 --> 34:58.469
a year or two I was in
a different foster home.

34:58.504 --> 35:03.441
And... I liked my foster brother.

35:05.211 --> 35:08.446
I mean, really liked him.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.415
It started out like no big deal.

35:10.449 --> 35:14.352
He was nice and funny and...

35:14.386 --> 35:17.121
and he paid a lot attention to me,

35:17.156 --> 35:20.458
which... that doesn't happen a whole lot.

35:20.492 --> 35:23.061
He even...

35:24.296 --> 35:28.533
he even used to hide candy bars in my bag,

35:28.567 --> 35:31.202
so that every day I'd got to school

35:31.237 --> 35:34.138
and open up my backpack
and I'd think of him.

35:36.475 --> 35:39.477
And when we'd watch TV
he would sit beside me

35:39.511 --> 35:43.448
and take my hand so that
his parents wouldn't see.

35:43.482 --> 35:47.418
Or if we were alone in the house

35:47.453 --> 35:49.087
for a little while,

35:49.121 --> 35:51.155
he would tickle me or...

35:59.164 --> 36:00.231
he told me I was special.

36:02.434 --> 36:04.235
I believed him.

36:04.270 --> 36:07.038
You are special, Callie.

36:07.072 --> 36:11.175
I may be. Yeah.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.244
But not to him.

36:14.513 --> 36:17.315
- Sarah? Where are you... ?
- I'm sorry.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.449
Callie, stop!

36:22.154 --> 36:23.454
Sarah, wait!

36:23.489 --> 36:25.189
Liam told me you would
do something like this.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.326
He doesn't love you,
Sarah. He's just using you.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.195
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.499
'Cause I used to be you.

36:34.533 --> 36:37.268
Look, why don't you come with me, ok?

36:37.303 --> 36:39.137
And we can tell..

36:39.171 --> 36:42.140
If you tell anyone anything, I'll deny it.

36:42.174 --> 36:44.375
Everyone will think it's just you.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.045
That you made it up.

36:47.079 --> 36:50.281
Or you're in love with
him, or you're crazy.

36:50.316 --> 36:52.083
It'll go on your record.

36:52.117 --> 36:54.152
Don't waste your time.

36:54.186 --> 36:56.954
It's just gonna come back on you.

37:04.163 --> 37:06.164
At least you tried.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.433
You did everything you could.

37:11.036 --> 37:12.470
Now it's up to her.

37:12.504 --> 37:14.238
It's her choice.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.007
No, it isn't.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.109
What?

37:20.379 --> 37:22.113
It isn't her choice.

37:23.382 --> 37:26.117
At least it wasn't mine.

37:28.354 --> 37:30.321
Um...

37:32.358 --> 37:36.060
One night... Liam...

37:38.364 --> 37:42.133
he came into my room

37:42.167 --> 37:47.138
and he asked me to... you know?

37:48.507 --> 37:50.942
And, um...

37:52.444 --> 37:55.313
and I told him I wasn't ready.

37:55.347 --> 37:57.014
He...

37:59.218 --> 38:00.418
he forced me...

38:07.259 --> 38:10.027
um, he forced me to have sex with him.

38:15.367 --> 38:16.968
I'm sorry.

38:18.137 --> 38:21.038
I always thought it was my fault.

38:22.374 --> 38:24.242
You know...

38:25.411 --> 38:27.445
but it wasn't.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.249
It wasn't my choice,

38:31.283 --> 38:33.451
and it wasn't my fault.

38:41.393 --> 38:43.461
Look, I know it's scary, but I promise you,

38:43.495 --> 38:45.496
the only thing the police
are gonna be interested in

38:45.531 --> 38:47.298
is finding your daughter.

38:47.332 --> 38:51.269
They are not gonna ask
questions about your status. Ok?

38:52.404 --> 38:54.972
- Yeah, ok.
- Ok.

39:01.346 --> 39:03.281
Oh, my God, Lexi.

39:03.315 --> 39:05.416
Where were you?

39:05.451 --> 39:08.319
- Where have you been?
- Mija.

39:08.353 --> 39:10.188
It doesn't matter where I was.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.057
I only came back because you're
not sending me to boarding school.

39:13.091 --> 39:15.126
I don't know what Mari and
Jesus told you, but we are...

39:15.160 --> 39:17.228
They told me that I'm undocumented.

39:20.365 --> 39:22.400
And so are you.

39:22.434 --> 39:26.103
And if you send me anywhere,
I'll call Immigration myself.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.014
Oh, hey, sweetie.

39:37.049 --> 39:38.216
What do you, uh, what do you need?

39:38.250 --> 39:39.484
Connor's mom is here to pick him up.

39:39.518 --> 39:42.086
Oh, ok. Bye, Connor. We
will see you again soon.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.055
- I'll walk you...
- No, it's ok.

39:44.089 --> 39:46.057
- I got it.
- Ok. Bye.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.261
Ok, I'll see you at school.

39:50.295 --> 39:52.330
Uh, wait.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.367
Here, keep it.

39:56.401 --> 39:58.169
I can't.

39:58.203 --> 40:01.272
Yes, you can. I mean,
it's cool. I want you to.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.209
Ok. See ya.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.456
Hey.

40:18.490 --> 40:20.458
So what do you think
her parents are gonna do?

40:20.492 --> 40:23.361
I don't know, but I don't think

40:23.395 --> 40:25.396
she's going away any time soon.

40:25.430 --> 40:28.099
- I mean, wow.
- Right?

40:28.133 --> 40:29.300
I had no idea that she was...

40:29.334 --> 40:31.168
Yeah, me neither.

40:31.203 --> 40:33.070
Did you see the look on her mom's face?

40:33.105 --> 40:35.306
Man, that Lexi's... she's a wild one.

40:35.340 --> 40:38.442
Well, you're the one who's, you know...

40:38.477 --> 40:42.079
You can't even say it.
Say it. "Dating her"?

40:42.114 --> 40:43.514
No, I can't. So, you know what?

40:43.549 --> 40:45.449
Just take what you can get.

Seeing people scared like

it really puts your
problems into perspective.

You don't think they're gonna
go to the Parent Board, do you?
