01:28.398 --> 01:31.299
Pardon me. Police! Excuse me.

01:34.425 --> 01:35.952
Julia?

01:36.710 --> 01:38.797
The victim suffered serious damage

01:38.818 --> 01:40.654
to the right side of her body.

01:40.928 --> 01:43.387
The blast appears to
have originated here.

01:43.415 --> 01:45.440
She may have even walked over it.

01:45.461 --> 01:48.222
- Perhaps she triggered it?
- Perhaps.

01:48.706 --> 01:51.870
Why would someone set
an explosive device here?

01:52.322 --> 01:56.136
Detective Murdoch. Dr. Ogden.
May I look at that victim?

01:56.181 --> 01:58.624
I'll need to clean her up,
Detective, before we can hope

01:58.640 --> 02:00.597
- to identify her.
- No. Wait, wait, wait.

02:01.175 --> 02:02.554
Detective...

02:07.661 --> 02:08.943
It's her.

02:10.193 --> 02:12.532
This is the woman I've been looking for.

02:13.031 --> 02:15.077
This is Muriel Bruce.

02:21.302 --> 02:24.094
Muriel Bruce disappeared
without a trace two years ago.

02:24.105 --> 02:26.140
One year later, she was
seen with a Lynn Clark

02:26.173 --> 02:28.926
on a streetcar, just before
Miss Clark's disappearance.

02:28.937 --> 02:30.961
Then in May of this year, she was seen

02:30.978 --> 02:33.967
at St. Stephen-in-the-Fields
with a Miss Natalie Sykes.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.715
And Miss Sykes was never seen again,

02:35.716 --> 02:36.781
- I imagine.
- Hm.

02:36.814 --> 02:39.226
And you believe this Muriel
Bruce's death to have something

02:39.237 --> 02:41.137
- to do with these missing women?
- Oh, it has to.

02:41.165 --> 02:43.621
Or perhaps she was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

02:43.644 --> 02:46.206
Don't say that. This is the
best lead I've had in months.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.771
Do you know where to
find the victim's husband?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.383
I know where to look.

02:51.706 --> 02:55.809
Cause of death was mass organ
failure due to percussive force.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.832
She has several broken bones,

02:57.866 --> 03:01.084
and significant burns to
her body on her right side.

03:01.527 --> 03:04.352
We extracted glass and
metal shards from her body,

03:04.358 --> 03:07.587
as well as fragments of
leather. Perhaps from a suitcase?

03:07.884 --> 03:10.654
I believe she may have
been carrying the bomb.

03:10.938 --> 03:12.728
Carrying it? Herself?

03:12.974 --> 03:14.219
How did that come to pass?

03:14.230 --> 03:16.847
So, did Muriel Bruce know
what was inside her suitcase?

03:16.886 --> 03:19.976
Given the circumstances,
I don't believe she did.

03:20.026 --> 03:22.123
She was wearing a ring
on her wedding finger.

03:22.139 --> 03:23.804
Yes, it has an inscription:

03:24.090 --> 03:26.781
"Aphrodite." The Greek goddess of love.

03:26.798 --> 03:29.041
Muriel had a book on Greek myths.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.958
She was obsessed with the goddesses.

03:31.026 --> 03:33.005
Perhaps she had the
ring made for herself.

03:33.044 --> 03:36.862
If we can find the jeweler,
then we may find her address.

03:41.409 --> 03:43.125
Hello, Mr. Desmond.

04:10.130 --> 04:11.979
Sirs? I found the jeweler.

04:12.024 --> 04:14.832
The ring is one of a
series. Each one is engraved

04:14.866 --> 04:17.063
with the name of a
different Greek goddess.

04:17.096 --> 04:19.726
- It's a standing commission.
- For Muriel Bruce?

04:19.846 --> 04:22.248
He doesn't know who ordered
them, only to send the rings

04:22.276 --> 04:25.118
- to the old Greenwood estate.
- The Greenwood Estate.

04:25.191 --> 04:27.977
- In Rosedale?
- Yes, sir. I was surprised, too.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.777
I had thought it empty ever since

04:29.806 --> 04:31.997
Lady Greenwood passed away.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.363
Hello?

04:40.166 --> 04:42.110
Toronto Constabulary.

04:50.504 --> 04:52.099
Pardon, Miss!

04:52.822 --> 04:54.773
OK, come on, everybody,

04:54.807 --> 04:56.674
into the house. Let's go.

04:56.702 --> 05:00.093
- Well, this is odd.
- You do lack subtlety.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.445
What are you doing here?

05:03.518 --> 05:06.826
- How did you get past the gate?
- It was open.

05:06.946 --> 05:10.201
Detective Murdoch, Detective
Watts, Toronto Constabulary.

05:10.206 --> 05:12.942
We're here to inquire
after a Mrs. Muriel Bruce.

05:12.981 --> 05:14.854
No one named Muriel lives here.

05:14.876 --> 05:17.656
What about... Aphrodite?

05:20.375 --> 05:21.855
Follow me.

05:22.903 --> 05:24.501
And you are?

05:27.259 --> 05:29.788
Uh, again, who are you?

05:29.908 --> 05:32.585
- Artemis.
- The goddess of the hunt.

05:32.641 --> 05:34.632
And protector of women.

05:34.996 --> 05:38.607
You mean all these women that
seem to be afraid of our presence?

05:39.262 --> 05:41.970
You are invading our sanctuary.

05:42.456 --> 05:46.412
This place is free of the
unwelcome influence of the male sex.

05:46.426 --> 05:48.314
Ah. You're modern Amazons,

05:48.336 --> 05:50.607
the warrior women who lived without men.

05:50.674 --> 05:54.137
Precisely. Strong and independent.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.007
You do know the Ancient
Greeks are the founders

05:58.012 --> 06:00.693
of our modern patriarchy. Even Aristotle

06:00.716 --> 06:03.680
thought of women as little
more than "deformed men."

06:03.800 --> 06:07.209
We women are well aware
of how men across history

06:07.240 --> 06:09.361
have deformed our lives.

06:11.272 --> 06:12.994
You say I lack subtlety.

06:13.071 --> 06:14.317
Athena!

06:14.636 --> 06:16.564
We have interlopers.

06:17.023 --> 06:19.017
- The police.
- Good day.

06:20.062 --> 06:21.358
Clarissa?

06:22.484 --> 06:23.757
You know each other.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.031
Llewellyn.

06:26.735 --> 06:29.099
Detective Murdoch, this is my sister.

06:31.408 --> 06:33.767
I haven't seen her in fifteen years.

06:39.171 --> 06:40.346
Clarissa...

06:40.772 --> 06:42.181
I go by Athena now.

06:42.939 --> 06:44.333
Goddess of wisdom.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.594
Although I don't feel
very wise in this moment.

06:51.355 --> 06:53.342
The last time I saw you,

06:53.360 --> 06:55.427
you were leaving for
work at the laundry.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.379
But you didn't go to work that day.

06:57.499 --> 06:59.025
And you never came back.

07:01.410 --> 07:04.591
I suppose it's time I told you
that I got involved with a man

07:04.613 --> 07:06.250
after our parents died.

07:07.438 --> 07:08.805
I didn't know.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.111
Who was he?

07:11.577 --> 07:13.075
Hector Coleman.

07:13.829 --> 07:16.981
- He mistreated you?
- He forced me to leave you.

07:17.977 --> 07:21.239
I can't imagine what he would have
done to both of us if I hadn't.

07:22.132 --> 07:25.124
I knew the landlady would take
care of you. She did, didn't she?

07:25.622 --> 07:27.963
Mrs. Young was kind enough.

07:28.474 --> 07:30.519
But how did you end up here?

07:31.479 --> 07:33.834
Lady Greenwood was
looking for a companion.

07:34.798 --> 07:37.471
I ran away from Hector and I
traveled the world with her.

07:38.261 --> 07:41.132
When she died five years
ago, she left me everything.

07:41.486 --> 07:43.150
Hector had already died,

07:43.199 --> 07:44.782
so it was safe to come back.

07:51.837 --> 07:55.322
You've been living here for five
years and you haven't looked for me?

07:55.345 --> 07:58.013
Mrs. Young had died. I
didn't know where to start.

07:59.663 --> 08:02.978
And then I met Artemis
and I found my purpose.

08:04.741 --> 08:07.217
Athena. The other man, he's...

08:07.270 --> 08:09.759
frightening everyone.
I don't know what to do.

08:13.105 --> 08:15.163
Detective Murdoch, I must insist

08:15.177 --> 08:16.809
that you leave the premises immediately.

08:16.832 --> 08:19.890
Miss Athena, I am simply trying
to speak with some of your tenants.

08:19.935 --> 08:22.029
He said that Aphrodite is dead.

08:23.944 --> 08:25.119
Is this true?

08:25.523 --> 08:29.083
I'm afraid so. She was killed
in an explosion earlier today.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.092
- Oh my dear lord.
- How?

08:31.899 --> 08:33.765
Artemis, take everyone inside.

08:35.110 --> 08:38.188
- Come on ladies, let's get inside.
- Are you certain it's her?

08:44.748 --> 08:48.621
Do you have any idea where
Muriel Bruce was going today?

08:49.927 --> 08:51.738
Not specifically.

08:52.230 --> 08:55.095
Muriel went out every
day to find women in need.

08:56.071 --> 08:59.092
Do you happen to know if any
of the women here had a problem

08:59.143 --> 09:00.942
with Muriel Bruce?

09:01.452 --> 09:04.704
Muriel was the reason most
of the women were here.

09:05.494 --> 09:07.893
Whoever did this to her is not among us.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.943
I'll need to speak with
all of them nevertheless.

09:12.546 --> 09:15.057
You are the first men to
cross the gate in years.

09:15.074 --> 09:16.868
And as you've already
experienced, Detective,

09:16.903 --> 09:19.631
they will not speak with you
and I cannot force them to.

09:22.097 --> 09:25.198
I will however pray you find
the evildoer responsible.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.923
I would like to see you again.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.990
I have promised these women
a world without men. I can...

09:31.259 --> 09:34.156
I can hardly make an
exception for myself.

09:39.347 --> 09:41.050
Goodbye, Llewellyn.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.358
Detective Watts!

09:54.969 --> 09:58.348
- Is it true? You found your sister?
- Yes.

09:59.112 --> 10:01.437
Was your reunion unsatisfactory?

10:01.557 --> 10:03.523
I know the truth, Jackson. That's...

10:03.539 --> 10:05.216
all I've ever hoped for.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.157
Forgive me, sir, but you
seem more disturbed than ever.

10:09.277 --> 10:11.712
She told me of a man
who caused all this.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.753
A man named Hector Coleman.

10:13.820 --> 10:16.999
- I will find him straightaway.
- No need. He's dead.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.540
Years ago.

10:20.883 --> 10:22.868
How could I have been so unaware?

10:23.131 --> 10:25.901
My sister was in distress
and I suspected nothing.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.531
You were only twelve years old.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.807
Age is no excuse for inattention.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.252
But sir, you found her.
Your sister is alive!

10:34.785 --> 10:36.265
Yes.

10:37.397 --> 10:38.933
So I'm at peace.

10:43.406 --> 10:47.179
I believe these pieces of metal to
be the remnants of an alarm clock.

10:47.252 --> 10:49.859
With the exception of
this monogrammed plate.

10:49.896 --> 10:52.577
Now the only discernible
initial is the letter "B".

10:52.628 --> 10:54.304
I have to get back into that house.

10:54.315 --> 10:56.597
Detective Watts, perhaps
you should recuse yourself.

10:56.642 --> 10:59.574
Muriel Bruce was seen with two
women just before they disappeared.

10:59.641 --> 11:01.402
Those two women are in that house.

11:01.441 --> 11:04.188
- You may be right. However...
- We'll get a judge's warrant.

11:04.308 --> 11:06.890
That may do your investigation
more harm than good.

11:06.907 --> 11:10.366
- We need a man on the inside.
- You mean a woman.

11:11.179 --> 11:14.055
And I believe that can be arranged.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.438
Hello.

11:18.691 --> 11:20.171
I'm Freddie Pink.

11:20.417 --> 11:23.208
A woman named Muriel
told me about this place.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.724
Come in.

11:31.408 --> 11:34.729
I met Muriel last week, at a church.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.823
St. Stephen-in-the-Fields.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.363
I'm so sorry to...

11:40.418 --> 11:43.664
have to tell you this,
but Muriel has died.

11:44.369 --> 11:47.677
Oh! Oh no!

11:47.923 --> 11:50.170
She was very kind to me at a time

11:50.177 --> 11:51.895
when I hadn't a friend in the world.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.668
That was her way.

11:55.305 --> 11:57.654
I suppose I ought to explain.

11:58.352 --> 12:01.523
I was forced to deal with
an abusive husband in...

12:01.578 --> 12:05.220
a... less than lawful way.
I... I had no choice...

12:05.981 --> 12:08.112
We all have a reason for being here.

12:08.731 --> 12:10.467
If Muriel invited you,

12:10.642 --> 12:12.603
you may consider yourself home.

12:13.895 --> 12:16.891
She said there were no men. Ever.

12:17.198 --> 12:20.221
When you remove the
inherent struggle of a woman

12:20.243 --> 12:22.226
in an unfriendly world,

12:22.702 --> 12:24.159
she is different.

12:24.751 --> 12:26.137
She is whole.

12:28.536 --> 12:30.282
We all share the chores here.

12:30.558 --> 12:33.395
Some of us like to cook,
others would rather dust.

12:33.434 --> 12:35.241
Perhaps you'll join the soap makers.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.961
- You make soap?
- Hm! Lovely soap.

12:39.081 --> 12:42.394
The great debate is whether
to sell it on the outside.

12:43.031 --> 12:45.310
I wouldn't want to go back out there.

12:45.338 --> 12:46.520
You won't have to.

12:46.772 --> 12:49.194
In truth, none of us ever leave.

12:49.906 --> 12:53.105
We find great relief in
staying within the gates.

12:55.237 --> 12:58.320
A society of women living
within a matriarchal structure.

12:58.331 --> 12:59.870
It's fascinating to say the least.

12:59.892 --> 13:02.434
And Detective Watts'
sister is the founder.

13:02.494 --> 13:04.565
That must have been quite a shock.

13:04.685 --> 13:07.111
I don't know. He seems to be preoccupied

13:07.138 --> 13:08.694
with his original cases.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.786
A man who avoids his feelings
by occupying himself with work.

13:12.906 --> 13:15.389
I should think you two have
found common ground at last.

13:15.433 --> 13:18.769
- Ahem!
- Inspector. Detective. Shall we begin?

13:18.889 --> 13:21.485
- Very good, Doctor.
- We've been able to remove

13:21.513 --> 13:24.584
most of the clothing,
after rehydrating her skin

13:24.597 --> 13:28.007
and some excellent
extraction work by Miss James.

13:28.201 --> 13:30.233
We discovered an imprint in her skin

13:30.238 --> 13:33.449
in the shape of the letter "N."
Well, the mirror image of one.

13:33.569 --> 13:34.638
Hm.

13:35.252 --> 13:36.610
I wonder.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.777
An N on the body and a B on the plate.

13:41.805 --> 13:43.662
Norman Bruce's suitcase.

13:43.684 --> 13:46.099
Perhaps Mr. Bruce found his wife,

13:46.477 --> 13:47.934
he arranged to meet with her,

13:47.967 --> 13:50.191
claiming only that he wanted
to return her belongings.

13:50.224 --> 13:52.235
But instead of all the
doings and what-have-yous,

13:52.268 --> 13:54.826
he put the explosives into
his suitcase, set the timer,

13:54.837 --> 13:56.059
and watched her walk away.

13:56.092 --> 13:57.926
Watts get a photograph,
have the constables

13:57.937 --> 13:59.356
distribute it all over the city.

13:59.394 --> 14:01.218
Norman Bruce is our
prime suspect, Murdoch.

14:01.229 --> 14:03.683
- I want him found. Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.744
Miss James, could I have a word?

14:17.854 --> 14:19.475
What can I help you with, Inspector?

14:19.508 --> 14:22.548
I'm afraid I feel compelled to
tell you something, Miss James.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.450
I'm very sorry...

14:25.719 --> 14:27.877
but I saw your young
man with another woman.

14:28.294 --> 14:29.367
Nate?

14:29.581 --> 14:31.641
There must be an innocent explanation.

14:31.701 --> 14:34.084
- When was this?
- Yesterday.

14:34.604 --> 14:37.267
You must have seen him
at work, then, Inspector.

14:37.826 --> 14:39.885
Does he work at the Queens Hotel?

14:44.860 --> 14:46.186
You mean to tell me...

14:46.613 --> 14:48.974
that instead of working,
he was at a fancy hotel

14:48.985 --> 14:51.083
cavorting with another woman?

14:51.203 --> 14:52.830
Miss James, please calm yourself...

14:52.836 --> 14:55.794
Now I feel compelled to give
that liar a piece of my mind.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.169
I was meant to be married.

14:59.196 --> 15:01.716
But when my fiancé found out
that my mother was Algonquin,

15:01.754 --> 15:04.602
- and not my father's wife...
- He suddenly changed his mind.

15:04.646 --> 15:06.586
I became an unmarriageable burden.

15:06.602 --> 15:08.689
So when the fire happened
I up and disappeared.

15:08.705 --> 15:10.162
That was when you met Muriel?

15:10.162 --> 15:12.692
Yes. At St. Stephen-in-the-Fields.
Same as you.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.218
So, this is your room.

15:15.590 --> 15:19.409
It was Aphrodite's. Um, Muriel's,

15:19.529 --> 15:21.457
our beautiful angel of mercy.

15:22.514 --> 15:24.700
Oh, Themis...

15:25.319 --> 15:28.058
- I can come back.
- No, Artemis, stay.

15:28.107 --> 15:30.315
We can help you clear
your cousin's things.

15:30.435 --> 15:31.975
Muriel was your cousin?

15:32.282 --> 15:34.665
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

15:34.785 --> 15:36.489
She told me a little about you.

15:36.506 --> 15:39.277
Uh, you once worked
in a pub, didn't you?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.211
Artemis didn't just work in a pub.

15:41.228 --> 15:43.791
She turned her father's pub
into a neighbourhood institution.

15:43.807 --> 15:45.605
And then, when her father
died without a will...

15:45.632 --> 15:48.541
- Themis.
- Artemis, you were wronged.

15:48.661 --> 15:50.979
It's not fair that your brother
should inherit everything

15:50.995 --> 15:52.853
- just because he's a boy.
- I see.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.729
The Rosie May. Named after my mother.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.330
I can still picture the sign.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.008
But now that's in the past.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.594
Excuse me.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.250
Hello.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.608
I'm Freddie.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.481
Demeter. Welcome.

16:21.879 --> 16:24.838
- Did I do something?
- Demeter just likes to keep to herself.

16:24.958 --> 16:27.100
She's very smart. She
left her family because

16:27.116 --> 16:28.853
they wouldn't let her
continue her studies.

16:28.973 --> 16:30.917
Surely her room isn't in the cellar.

16:30.939 --> 16:33.300
Oh no. Of course not.
It's just that no one

16:33.333 --> 16:35.069
other than Demeter goes down there.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.690
Demeter likes her solitude.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.580
We've all come to respect that.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.077
Gentlemen.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.251
Muriel Bruce was well loved
and universally mourned.

16:54.371 --> 16:56.535
Not even her cousin
Artemis, knows what happened.

16:56.579 --> 16:59.658
Artemis is Muriel Bruce's
cousin? Are you sure?

16:59.696 --> 17:02.003
It's confirmed by details
that Detective Watts gave me.

17:02.014 --> 17:04.330
What about the women?
Have you identified them?

17:04.368 --> 17:09.538
Some names, uh, mostly just
clues from their past lives. Uh...

17:09.944 --> 17:11.987
Maybe you should ask first.

17:13.619 --> 17:15.415
May I please have the paper?

17:15.536 --> 17:17.819
Not me. No, the women.

17:18.098 --> 17:20.630
If this were my case,
I'd think twice before

17:20.640 --> 17:23.075
exposing them to people
they'd intentionally left.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.176
Good thing this isn't your case.

17:30.886 --> 17:34.638
Yes, hello, I'm waiting on the
clerk to check on a Hector Coleman?

17:34.665 --> 17:36.922
He died over five years ago.

17:38.982 --> 17:41.293
- I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
- Jackson.

17:41.413 --> 17:44.005
- Updates on Norman Bruce?
- Ah, Sir,

17:44.027 --> 17:46.360
there's no sightings of Mr.
Bruce at the train stations

17:46.382 --> 17:48.568
or the cab companies. But
the lads are on it, sir.

17:48.688 --> 17:50.769
- If he's in the city, we'll find him.
- Carry on.

17:51.318 --> 17:52.665
Right then, Watts.

17:52.785 --> 17:54.462
How goes it with our lady policeman?

17:54.506 --> 17:56.182
She lacks objectivity.

17:56.302 --> 17:59.124
Just from looking at
this list I can close...

17:59.244 --> 18:02.646
six files. Two more I don't even
recognize, likely never reported.

18:02.668 --> 18:05.984
- I'll start the calls right away.
- Wait until the Bruce murder is solved.

18:06.228 --> 18:08.074
Their families have waited long enough.

18:08.096 --> 18:09.733
Those women are not going anywhere

18:09.761 --> 18:12.391
and this case is messy enough
without a horde of disgruntled men

18:12.413 --> 18:14.351
descending on my station house.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.235
What do you open?

18:51.015 --> 18:52.911
This was left for me last night.

18:52.922 --> 18:54.752
I've tried a few locks but no luck.

18:54.774 --> 18:56.143
It's corroded.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.474
- Sodium hydroxide.
- A very specific guess.

18:59.485 --> 19:02.645
It's not a guess. Sodium
hydroxide... or lye...

19:02.656 --> 19:04.294
is used in soap making.

19:04.414 --> 19:06.699
The favoured activity of this household.

19:07.366 --> 19:10.139
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary...

19:10.342 --> 19:12.034
You've no right to be here.

19:12.154 --> 19:14.483
No one invited you. No. Men. Allowed.

19:14.510 --> 19:16.082
Please, Miss, just a few questions.

19:16.099 --> 19:17.890
Get away from these gates
before I find a shotgun.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.739
- Llewellyn, what are you doing here?
- My job.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.214
Wait for me in my salon.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.875
Please, Miss Athena.

19:27.886 --> 19:29.956
We were hoping to
speak with you directly.

19:30.076 --> 19:31.595
Ask your questions.

19:31.633 --> 19:33.523
No, you may not come in.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.686
Have you seen this man

19:35.713 --> 19:37.669
approach your property
in the past few days?

19:37.789 --> 19:39.784
I don't think so. Who is he?

19:39.904 --> 19:41.899
Muriel Bruce's husband.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.348
And you believe he is her killer?

19:45.734 --> 19:47.114
Oh dear lord.

19:48.045 --> 19:50.603
And you wonder why we seek
refuge behind these walls.

19:50.630 --> 19:53.901
Perhaps he was driven to madness
by her mysterious absence.

19:54.021 --> 19:55.095
Llewellyn.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.388
This is a list of names.

19:58.404 --> 20:00.590
Can you confirm these
women are in this house?

20:01.823 --> 20:03.504
How did you get this?

20:03.576 --> 20:05.366
Will you confirm or not?

20:05.486 --> 20:07.251
Their families are
desperate for any news.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.631
No. You cannot tell their families.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.965
Someone cared enough to
report these women missing.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.194
Muriel Bruce's husband
cared enough to kill her.

20:13.205 --> 20:15.094
Many of these women
would meet a similar fate

20:15.127 --> 20:17.505
if they were reunited with
their so-called loved ones.

20:17.521 --> 20:19.499
- They deserve to know!
- Please, please.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.183
Perhaps we can reach a compromise.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.915
We'll alert the families that
their women have been found,

20:26.931 --> 20:29.024
but not where they are.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.791
If you will in turn tell
the women what we are doing,

20:32.032 --> 20:35.685
and allow each one to
choose her own next steps.

20:38.495 --> 20:40.237
I suppose I can live with that.

20:40.357 --> 20:43.727
- Yes. Fine. Agreed.
- All right.

20:43.733 --> 20:45.979
Thank you, Miss Athena. Good day.

20:46.181 --> 20:49.408
- Llewellyn.
- Ahem!

20:49.835 --> 20:51.621
I know you're angry.

20:52.164 --> 20:54.344
But what I'm doing here is important.

20:54.985 --> 20:57.449
It's more important
than you or me, it's...

20:57.734 --> 20:59.980
it's more important than our hurt.

21:17.997 --> 21:19.744
Miss Pink?

21:20.633 --> 21:22.116
Miss Pink?

21:24.336 --> 21:25.721
Why are there police here?

21:25.841 --> 21:27.277
Who were they looking for?

21:27.298 --> 21:29.974
Those policemen are
investigating poor Muriel's death.

21:30.009 --> 21:31.266
They are not permitted within the gates

21:31.280 --> 21:32.919
and will not try to enter again.

21:33.953 --> 21:35.496
How can you be so sure?

21:36.266 --> 21:37.428
It's their world.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.154
We're just pretending we're not in it.

21:39.886 --> 21:41.156
Do you like it here?

21:43.624 --> 21:44.759
Yes.

21:45.858 --> 21:46.595
But...

21:46.923 --> 21:49.027
I've learned a few things about you

21:49.053 --> 21:50.916
in your short time here.

21:58.380 --> 22:01.548
Which is why I felt this
would be most appropriate.

22:22.373 --> 22:23.403
Hestia?

22:24.696 --> 22:27.514
Goddess of the hearth, the home.

22:29.284 --> 22:30.972
You are a protector.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.127
You will protect us, and our home.

22:37.554 --> 22:39.307
Rebecca. It's not what you think.

22:39.811 --> 22:42.016
- Can't you just trust me?
- How can I trust you

22:42.037 --> 22:44.014
when you lie to my face
and won't tell me why?

22:44.659 --> 22:46.622
- We're through.
- Rebecca!

22:48.318 --> 22:50.299
You heard the young lady's decision.

22:50.513 --> 22:52.894
Now prove yourself to
be a man and respect it.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.680
What right do you have to tell
her I was stepping out on her?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.166
I saw what I saw.

22:58.332 --> 23:00.295
You, canoodling that
woman in the Queen's Hotel.

23:00.415 --> 23:02.315
- Canoodling?
- Yes, canoodling!

23:02.806 --> 23:04.216
What you saw...

23:04.866 --> 23:06.842
was a woman teaching me to read.

23:08.862 --> 23:10.343
Why hide that from Miss James?

23:10.373 --> 23:12.205
Rebecca is going to be a
doctor, for heaven's sakes.

23:12.244 --> 23:13.901
How can I tell her I can't even read?

23:14.107 --> 23:16.416
I don't think you give the
young lady enough credit.

23:18.506 --> 23:19.856
Who am I kidding?

23:20.530 --> 23:21.783
You did me a favour.

23:22.893 --> 23:25.470
A heart only breaks worse
the longer it's pledged.

23:38.016 --> 23:38.950
Ahem!

23:40.361 --> 23:41.894
Ah, Jackson.

23:41.929 --> 23:44.590
Give me a task. I am not
fond of sitting idly by,

23:44.598 --> 23:47.342
waiting for others to do
their jobs so I can do mine.

23:49.546 --> 23:51.431
You've always sought the truth, sir.

23:51.501 --> 23:54.135
- The truth is all that matters.
- Hector Coleman,

23:54.358 --> 23:55.451
the man who took your sister

23:55.452 --> 23:56.692
- away from you...
- I never wanna hear that name again.

23:57.489 --> 23:58.759
He's alive, sir.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.745
And he lives in Toronto.

24:03.590 --> 24:06.795
- Hestia! I love it. It suits you!
- Does it?

24:07.294 --> 24:09.754
Athena can see into
the heart of a person.

24:09.956 --> 24:13.342
Well, in that spirit I'd
like to make myself useful.

24:13.462 --> 24:15.336
I happen to have a soap recipe,

24:15.363 --> 24:17.604
- that's excellent for the complexion.
- Oh, wonderful!

24:17.610 --> 24:20.632
- I'd like to be the first to try it.
- Where are the supplies?

24:20.668 --> 24:23.549
- I'd like to make a test batch first.
- In the cellar.

24:23.823 --> 24:27.200
But don't go down there. Ask
Demeter and she'll get them for you.

24:27.255 --> 24:28.751
I'm the goddess of the household.

24:28.762 --> 24:32.115
- Surely I can fetch my own supplies.
- Really. Don't.

24:32.235 --> 24:33.540
Really.

24:34.082 --> 24:35.742
Where is Demeter?

24:36.071 --> 24:38.093
I should at least invite her to join us.

24:53.348 --> 24:55.413
What are you doing down here?

24:55.446 --> 24:56.848
I was just looking for some lye.

24:56.876 --> 24:59.910
- To make soap.
- I know what lye is for. And we're all out.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.786
Don't come down here again.

25:04.698 --> 25:06.691
So what's all this, me old mucker?

25:06.725 --> 25:09.513
It's a timer, sir, made
with an alarm clock.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.531
It has a string affixed to the ringer.

25:12.696 --> 25:14.930
Now, once the desired time is reached,

25:14.941 --> 25:18.145
the string pulls the cork,
releasing an incendiary fluid,

25:18.195 --> 25:20.539
which then makes contact
with the explosive.

25:20.550 --> 25:24.345
Once that happens, the
blasting cap is ignited and...

25:26.645 --> 25:28.996
- What happened?
- Alright, back to work everybody.

25:29.002 --> 25:31.428
It's just Murdoch
experimenting. Back to work!

25:32.026 --> 25:33.407
Alright!

25:34.206 --> 25:36.792
It's simple enough Norman
Bruce could have made it.

25:36.808 --> 25:38.030
It fits.

25:38.227 --> 25:40.516
Especially since I've just
learned that the TNT was stolen

25:40.527 --> 25:42.883
from Mr. Bruce's worksite
only three days ago.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.678
That's the day before
Mrs. Bruce was killed.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.912
When did you last see her, Mr. Coleman?

25:52.951 --> 25:56.222
Fourteen years ago. Too
long to be holding on, but

25:56.342 --> 25:58.757
I guess I always hoped she'd come back.

25:58.779 --> 26:00.033
How did you meet her?

26:00.055 --> 26:02.866
I saw her staring at a
poster of Niagara Falls.

26:02.882 --> 26:04.690
She said she'd always wanted to go.

26:04.903 --> 26:06.223
We started talking.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.195
Then you forced her
to move away with you.

26:08.239 --> 26:10.496
No! Moving was her idea.

26:10.518 --> 26:13.936
Her parents were dead
and she was all alone.

26:14.276 --> 26:16.494
She just wanted to get
away from the memories.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.420
I moved because she asked me to.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.647
I'd even bought tickets to
honeymoon in Niagara Falls.

26:22.767 --> 26:25.589
The next day she was
gone. So were the tickets.

26:25.594 --> 26:27.298
You never saw her again.

26:28.947 --> 26:30.377
Did you find her?

26:30.936 --> 26:33.211
I just wanna know what I did wrong.

26:33.245 --> 26:36.507
No point in asking. Can't
believe a word she says.

26:52.436 --> 26:55.170
I knew you were up to something.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.986
What are you really doing down here?

27:01.473 --> 27:03.162
You're researching chromosomes.

27:03.282 --> 27:04.877
You know how to read that?

27:04.997 --> 27:06.657
This looks like an accessory chromosome,

27:06.662 --> 27:09.138
the one that determines
that a baby will be male?

27:09.768 --> 27:11.494
You know some science.

27:11.970 --> 27:13.411
How refreshing.

27:14.107 --> 27:16.319
But that assumption
by the male-dominated

27:16.369 --> 27:19.097
scientific establishment is wrong.

27:19.591 --> 27:21.797
- You've proven that?
- No, not me.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.249
Nettie Stevens.

27:23.594 --> 27:26.640
She's an American on the brink
of publishing her findings.

27:27.746 --> 27:32.313
The "accessory" or "X element"
chromosome is, in fact,

27:32.653 --> 27:34.526
the female determiner.

27:35.332 --> 27:37.890
Women are the default of nature.

27:38.619 --> 27:42.075
Are you... trying to manipulate babies?

27:42.354 --> 27:43.866
Not quite.

27:46.085 --> 27:48.923
You might actually understand my work.

27:50.019 --> 27:52.637
What I'm about to show
you is not for everyone.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.832
Where is that key?

27:59.396 --> 28:01.592
Oh, here it is.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.995
You can't tell anyone.

28:05.345 --> 28:07.060
Athena wouldn't like it.

28:07.272 --> 28:08.517
Why not?

28:08.539 --> 28:10.637
Because it's not for the faint of heart.

28:11.059 --> 28:13.240
I want to effect change.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.404
Real change.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.704
I want to...

28:17.737 --> 28:20.476
eradicate the male sex altogether.

28:23.478 --> 28:25.483
And it starts right here.

28:32.390 --> 28:36.071
That's him. That's Norman Bruce.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.948
He was struck in the
head with something heavy,

28:38.970 --> 28:40.581
likely the cause of death.

28:40.910 --> 28:43.183
But how did he come to
be inside this house?

28:43.221 --> 28:45.388
And inside a tub of lye.

28:45.508 --> 28:47.242
Luckily it sprang a leak,

28:47.275 --> 28:49.440
or we'd have nothing
left but flesh soup.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.662
He was obviously killed out
of revenge for Muriel's death.

28:52.697 --> 28:53.921
Really.

28:54.118 --> 28:56.715
So, they learned that Muriel had died,

28:56.720 --> 28:59.454
discovered her husband
killed her, lured him here,

28:59.487 --> 29:02.346
killed him and disposed of
the body all in the 24 hours

29:02.395 --> 29:05.256
between when Muriel died and
I arrived at the front gate.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.878
Who does this all belong to?

29:07.912 --> 29:09.302
It's Demeter's.

29:09.505 --> 29:13.450
She told me that she is attempting
to eradicate the male species.

29:14.156 --> 29:15.690
One at a time?

29:17.925 --> 29:21.157
- You betrayed us.
- How could you lie to us like that?

29:21.195 --> 29:23.791
- A girl's got to make a living.
- Miss Pink.

29:24.925 --> 29:26.963
For what it's worth, I am sorry.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.491
Get out.

29:30.113 --> 29:31.635
You don't need the goddesses.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.745
Maybe you should just be yourselves.

29:34.030 --> 29:36.024
There ought to be
strength enough in that.

29:37.689 --> 29:38.724
Ladies.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.962
We will be conducting a
full search of the estate.

29:40.964 --> 29:43.786
- Please, cooperate.
- You can't. I won't allow it.

29:44.164 --> 29:46.552
This is a crime scene,
and I am the police.

29:46.624 --> 29:49.822
Whatever authority you think
you have means nothing to me!

29:55.311 --> 29:58.021
How did Mr. Bruce come
to be in your cupboard?

29:58.141 --> 30:00.416
I would like to know that as well.

30:01.561 --> 30:04.803
Do you deny killing him as
a means of eradicating men?

30:06.551 --> 30:08.872
I'm not a killer, I'm a scientist.

30:09.333 --> 30:10.401
Oh?

30:11.130 --> 30:13.584
Then how do you propose
to reach your goal?

30:15.923 --> 30:17.665
I'll try to explain it to you,

30:17.693 --> 30:19.816
but don't expect to understand.

30:20.634 --> 30:23.176
I'll endeavour to muddle along.

30:25.176 --> 30:28.005
If two chromosomes are
needed to make life...

30:28.370 --> 30:31.673
oh, do you need me to
explain what a chromosome is?

30:31.793 --> 30:33.075
I've got the gist.

30:33.403 --> 30:34.608
Right.

30:35.194 --> 30:37.701
So, two chromosomes combine,

30:37.735 --> 30:39.703
then, a baby forms.

30:39.987 --> 30:42.216
I hope to fertilize an egg

30:42.336 --> 30:46.013
with two female chromosomes,
ensuring a female baby.

30:46.429 --> 30:49.479
- All I need to do...
- Is isolate a chromosome,

30:49.662 --> 30:51.831
find a suitable egg, fertilize it,

30:51.864 --> 30:54.193
and then re-implant it in a human womb,

30:54.390 --> 30:56.844
hoping that a normal gestation ensues.

30:57.321 --> 30:58.903
Well done, Detective.

31:00.513 --> 31:03.317
Only female children would be born,

31:03.361 --> 31:05.585
eliminating men altogether.

31:07.218 --> 31:10.200
If that were possible,
it would take decades.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.969
- Centuries.
- Well, yes.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.205
Of course!

31:16.673 --> 31:19.992
Perhaps you decided to use
Mr. Bruce as your own...

31:20.112 --> 31:22.287
test subject of sorts. Hm?

31:22.304 --> 31:25.262
And I would need a female
research subject, Detective.

31:25.449 --> 31:27.666
Besides, if I had killed that man,

31:27.688 --> 31:29.920
I wouldn't have opened
that door for anyone.

31:32.153 --> 31:35.291
William, I found something
interesting on the remaining flesh

31:35.313 --> 31:37.208
of Norman Bruce's hands.

31:37.219 --> 31:40.309
It's yellow staining, a
reaction to trinitrotoluene.

31:40.336 --> 31:42.866
Proving that he handled the TNT.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.688
So we can close the case on
the murder of Muriel Bruce.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.605
Sisters, please! Remain calm!

31:48.639 --> 31:51.812
Our oasis has been invaded,
but we will regain it.

31:56.025 --> 31:57.230
Blood.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.997
That doesn't belong in
here. That goes in the foyer.

32:00.008 --> 32:01.404
And yet, it's here.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.076
Hidden in your salon.

32:04.127 --> 32:05.902
You killed Norman Bruce.

32:05.963 --> 32:08.669
- No, I... I never even met the man.
- You're lying.

32:09.332 --> 32:11.161
Hector Coleman isn't dead.

32:14.136 --> 32:16.168
- What?
- Hector Coleman.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.235
The man you said forced you to leave me.

32:19.405 --> 32:22.105
The man you said had
died is alive and well.

32:24.636 --> 32:26.643
I said that for your safety.

32:26.865 --> 32:28.711
He certainly told a different story.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.370
Of course he did. Are
you going to believe

32:30.381 --> 32:32.512
some strange man or your own sister?

32:32.804 --> 32:34.684
Why would I believe my sister?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.885
I never got the chance to
know her. I have no reason

32:38.005 --> 32:40.357
to believe you're capable of the truth.

32:43.806 --> 32:47.240
I saw no reason to hurt you
again, but if you insist.

32:50.308 --> 32:52.400
I left you because I did not wish

32:52.400 --> 32:55.008
to be chained into a life of servitude.

32:57.215 --> 32:59.762
I left you because I didn't want you.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.736
That's the truth.

33:11.101 --> 33:13.193
Clarissa Watts, you are under arrest

33:13.232 --> 33:15.558
for the murder of Norman Bruce.

33:16.732 --> 33:20.497
- Constables. Take her to the cells.
- I was right to leave you.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.517
You're just another man.

33:22.566 --> 33:24.402
You're deluded and
oppressive and arrogant

33:24.413 --> 33:26.522
just like ALL THE REST OF THEM!!

33:32.668 --> 33:34.410
He arrested his sister?

33:34.449 --> 33:36.446
The murder weapon was in her study.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.248
Is that the entirety of the evidence?

33:38.282 --> 33:40.617
Yes. And now she refuses to speak.

33:40.651 --> 33:42.217
Your report is ready, Doctor?

33:42.239 --> 33:45.444
- I'm sorry to hear about your sister, Detective.
- Yes. Well,

33:45.515 --> 33:48.007
Life is but cruel
sport for whatever maker

33:48.007 --> 33:49.618
you are forced to believe in.

33:50.275 --> 33:53.709
- Detective Watts. I understand...
- Would your sister forsake you

33:53.726 --> 33:56.633
for a house of women who have
eschewed the world in which you live?

33:57.861 --> 34:00.758
My sister was a nun.

34:07.562 --> 34:11.081
Yes. Uh... my findings... uh...

34:11.114 --> 34:13.817
The statue of Athena
was the murder weapon.

34:13.851 --> 34:17.188
Mr. Bruce was struck across
the left temple, four days ago,

34:17.210 --> 34:19.289
and died almost immediately.

34:19.322 --> 34:21.324
Did you say four days ago?

34:21.358 --> 34:23.522
- Are you sure?
- Quite.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.905
Well then, Norman Bruce died the day

34:25.918 --> 34:28.431
before his wife, Muriel Bruce, did.

34:28.828 --> 34:30.597
There was no time to set a bomb.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.411
He could not have
been his wife's killer.

34:32.531 --> 34:34.534
Then how did she come to have the TNT?

34:34.574 --> 34:37.931
Perhaps Mrs. Bruce stole it from
her husband when she visited him?

34:38.264 --> 34:40.059
We found no yellow staining on her,

34:40.065 --> 34:42.226
she can't have handled the TNT herself.

34:42.726 --> 34:45.965
She must have asked her
husband to steal the TNT.

34:46.408 --> 34:48.676
Which would explain the
staining on his hands

34:48.693 --> 34:52.072
- and the use of his suitcase.
- So Muriel appears out of nowhere.

34:52.088 --> 34:55.041
She asks Norman for TNT.
A day or two later he

34:55.096 --> 34:58.355
delivers the stolen goods
to her in his suitcase...

34:58.804 --> 35:00.174
at the estate?

35:00.355 --> 35:02.009
No, she never would have allowed that.

35:02.026 --> 35:04.550
He must have followed her
there after the exchange.

35:04.556 --> 35:06.457
- He knocks.
- Whoever answered the door...

35:06.468 --> 35:07.848
Perhaps Mrs. Bruce herself...

35:07.875 --> 35:09.777
Struck him in the head with the statue.

35:09.897 --> 35:12.576
Which was by all accounts
normally just beside the door.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.532
The killer then dragged
the body down to the cellar.

35:14.559 --> 35:17.139
He put him in lye, thinking
that would be the end of it.

35:18.432 --> 35:20.059
Which means Muriel Bruce

35:20.103 --> 35:22.300
was knowingly in
possession of explosives.

35:22.317 --> 35:25.455
And on her way somewhere... with a bomb.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.423
Where could she have
been going from here?

35:34.417 --> 35:36.422
In that direction it's all houses.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.153
That way is a row of shops,

35:38.273 --> 35:41.319
and this, right here, is
the new apartment building.

35:41.439 --> 35:44.307
They're just putting up the ribbon
for the grand opening out front.

35:44.611 --> 35:46.809
So, no obvious target then.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.034
Not unless she missed the
pub that used to stand here,

35:50.083 --> 35:52.081
The Rose and something..?

35:52.201 --> 35:55.051
- Not the Rosie May?
- Yes. That's the one.

35:55.171 --> 35:57.253
That was Artemis' father's pub.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.927
Her brother tore it
down to develop the land.

35:59.942 --> 36:02.600
That's why she moved in with
Athena in the first place.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.662
So the apartment building
was the intended target.

36:05.782 --> 36:08.192
Muriel Bruce had
reached her destination.

36:08.242 --> 36:10.088
Only the bomb went off too soon.

36:10.296 --> 36:13.353
Then it was Artemis' plot to
wreak revenge on her brother.

36:13.775 --> 36:15.772
Your sister was telling the truth.

36:15.950 --> 36:17.626
She didn't kill anyone.

36:20.830 --> 36:24.117
Yes, I read about it in the
papers. Who could miss it?

36:24.845 --> 36:27.973
Toronto's first apartment building.

36:28.433 --> 36:29.989
My brother is making a fortune

36:30.033 --> 36:31.917
at the expense of our family legacy.

36:32.570 --> 36:33.934
How nice for him.

36:36.010 --> 36:38.162
So you admit to the plot then?

36:38.212 --> 36:41.164
Muriel was a loyal friend.
May she rest in peace.

36:41.169 --> 36:43.689
But I had nothing to
do with what she did.

36:45.682 --> 36:47.303
Please take off your gloves.

37:20.663 --> 37:25.374
This is proof that you
handled the TNT, that you...

37:25.418 --> 37:27.511
made the bomb that killed Muriel Bruce

37:27.511 --> 37:29.583
and you will be charged with her murder.

37:30.339 --> 37:33.120
No. Never.

37:34.157 --> 37:36.895
I don't know why the
bomb went off so early.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.891
- Please...
- So, your plan was to disrupt

37:39.929 --> 37:41.517
your brother's opening ceremony?

37:41.556 --> 37:43.939
Or damage the building beyond repair?

37:44.213 --> 37:46.601
I just wanted my brother to suffer.

37:47.839 --> 37:51.668
So, you had Muriel Bruce
steal the explosives.

37:52.057 --> 37:54.067
She said that she had a plan.

37:54.405 --> 37:57.073
I didn't know it involved
that brute, Norman.

37:57.327 --> 37:59.742
He followed Mrs. Bruce to the estate.

38:00.591 --> 38:02.864
I opened the door and there he was...

38:04.064 --> 38:07.650
threatening to go to the police
unless Muriel left with him.

38:07.976 --> 38:10.352
You hit him over the
head with the statue

38:10.472 --> 38:12.817
and placed his body in a tub of lye?

38:13.321 --> 38:17.308
I was going to make a special
batch of shaving soap for men.

38:19.963 --> 38:22.617
Muriel would have
thought that a great joke.

38:23.784 --> 38:26.903
But your plan failed
when the tub leaked.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.911
I was waiting for the
next delivery of lye

38:28.922 --> 38:30.538
when Miss Pink showed up.

38:31.420 --> 38:33.939
So you slipped the key into her room.

38:37.319 --> 38:39.082
So you set up Athena.

38:39.116 --> 38:40.743
The woman who took you in.

38:40.759 --> 38:44.354
Athena doesn't care what
goes on outside those gates.

38:44.474 --> 38:47.990
Too many women are suffering
at the hands of men.

38:48.461 --> 38:51.627
Muriel would tell me
about them. Every day.

38:51.830 --> 38:55.900
We needed to act, not
hide in an ivory tower.

38:56.103 --> 38:58.562
We needed to start a war.

38:59.724 --> 39:03.312
With your friend Muriel
as the first casualty.

39:10.553 --> 39:12.915
Reproductive manipulation?

39:13.127 --> 39:15.499
This Demeter was attempting
to fertilize the egg

39:15.532 --> 39:18.189
- outside the womb?
- I don't know how successfully.

39:18.309 --> 39:19.443
You could ask her, though.

39:19.563 --> 39:22.024
She'd be thrilled to discuss her
work with someone who understands it.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.634
And perhaps I will.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.839
- Detective Watts.
- Uh, Miss Pink.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.877
Doctor Ogden.

39:30.903 --> 39:33.395
I know all too well how
family can disappoint.

39:34.343 --> 39:36.484
You didn't choose her for a sister.

39:38.046 --> 39:40.593
But in fairness, she
didn't choose you, either.

39:43.313 --> 39:46.926
Your face is... symmetrical.

39:49.299 --> 39:52.410
But... that hat...

39:56.978 --> 39:59.662
I offended him, I think...

39:59.696 --> 40:02.665
I think that was his
attempt at a compliment.

40:08.060 --> 40:09.397
Miss James?

40:10.104 --> 40:12.370
- Inspector!
- Oh!

40:13.471 --> 40:15.241
Miss James.

40:15.909 --> 40:18.434
I feel the need to right a great wrong.

40:19.020 --> 40:21.562
Mr. Desmond wasn't stepping out on you.

40:21.682 --> 40:23.222
He was taking reading lessons.

40:23.233 --> 40:25.517
Are you telling me that Nate can't read?

40:26.103 --> 40:28.912
- I'm so happy you told me.
- I knew you would be.

40:28.929 --> 40:31.557
I had been feeling so badly, but now...

40:31.750 --> 40:34.160
Such relief! I mean...

40:34.331 --> 40:36.615
I couldn't possibly
be with an illiterate.

40:36.824 --> 40:39.333
- But Miss James...
- I am indebted to you, Inspector.

40:39.453 --> 40:42.329
You can't mean that, surely...

40:42.369 --> 40:45.276
I'm sorry, Rebecca, I
couldn't hold it in any longer.

40:45.298 --> 40:47.907
I almost burst myself.
Nate told me the truth.

40:47.941 --> 40:50.534
And now I got the prettiest
tutor in all of Toronto.

40:51.178 --> 40:52.304
We're sorry.

40:53.104 --> 40:54.884
We couldn't resist, Inspector.

40:55.004 --> 40:57.817
I suppose I deserved
that. Teach me to meddle.

40:57.851 --> 40:59.276
Thank you, actually.

40:59.671 --> 41:02.388
It's nice knowing that there's
someone looking out for me.

41:03.993 --> 41:05.483
Oh...

41:05.538 --> 41:08.561
I'll leave you to it. Whatever it is.

41:13.639 --> 41:14.850
Clarissa.

41:22.097 --> 41:24.152
You'll be gratified to
know some of the women

41:24.174 --> 41:26.452
have spoken to their
families. I was wrong

41:26.501 --> 41:28.030
to encourage them not to.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.550
Thank you for that.

41:33.601 --> 41:35.469
I'll be moving the
household across the ocean

41:35.491 --> 41:38.424
to one of Lady Greenwood's other
estates. I won't tell you where.

41:41.829 --> 41:43.245
I won't see you again.

41:45.006 --> 41:47.144
No. Seems the best thing.

41:51.168 --> 41:54.421
I... believe I can
understand why you left.

41:55.835 --> 41:57.198
But I can't forgive you.

42:01.387 --> 42:03.464
I was only 12 years old.

42:04.082 --> 42:05.712
I didn't expect you could.

42:10.673 --> 42:11.606
Ahem.

42:11.726 --> 42:13.499
I thought you might want this.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.558
It belonged to Muriel.

42:19.411 --> 42:20.550
Goodbye, Llewellyn.

42:21.476 --> 42:22.992
Goodbye, Clarissa.

42:44.754 --> 42:45.837
Sir.

42:48.497 --> 42:49.803
The truth is absolute,

42:49.860 --> 42:52.178
unyielding, and eternal, Jackson.

42:52.752 --> 42:56.271
It is our one constant
in a turbulent universe.

42:57.099 --> 42:58.707
Yes it is, sir.

43:00.666 --> 43:01.744
Here,

43:02.532 --> 43:04.010
I thought you could use this.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.111
Indeed I could.
