WEBVTT

00:06.959 --> 00:09.193
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:09.228 --> 00:11.896
Karen, I came back...
for you.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.297
Oh.

00:13.332 --> 00:15.867
- Atticus just fired me.
- Bummer.

00:15.901 --> 00:18.069
But not before he fired you too.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.537
I need to present myself
to Karen

00:19.571 --> 00:21.205
as an adult male with a job.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.941
- You must be Hank.
- Henry James Moody I.

00:23.976 --> 00:25.877
Rick Rath.
Call me Rath.

00:25.911 --> 00:27.645
The last thing I need around
here is some snotty,

00:27.679 --> 00:29.981
pretentious fuck who's gonna
look down on television.

00:30.015 --> 00:31.782
I'm trying to grow
the fuck up for once

00:31.817 --> 00:33.651
before it's too fucking late,

00:33.685 --> 00:35.653
and it all starts
with me getting a job.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.488
Are you sure you can actually
handle a job?

00:37.522 --> 00:40.024
Hey, did you manage
to get it up last night?

00:40.058 --> 00:41.459
I don't want to talk about it.

00:41.493 --> 00:43.327
- You're Hank Moody.
- Who would you be?

00:43.362 --> 00:44.795
This would be Levon.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.130
He's the kid
I've been telling you about.

00:46.198 --> 00:48.238
He wants to interview you
for his college newspaper.

00:48.267 --> 00:49.433
Do you have any children?

00:49.468 --> 00:51.502
Yeah, one, a daughter.

00:51.536 --> 00:53.070
You fucked my mom.

00:53.105 --> 00:55.172
Really?
You're not fucking with me?

00:55.207 --> 00:57.208
When did this occur?

00:57.242 --> 00:59.810
I guess about nine months
before I was born.

01:07.753 --> 01:10.087
Yay! It's a murse!

01:10.122 --> 01:12.690
My very own murse!
How did you know?

01:12.724 --> 01:14.191
Stop it.

01:14.226 --> 01:17.495
It's for all your writerly
accoutrement.

01:17.529 --> 01:19.864
I thought it was very
rock and roll.

01:19.898 --> 01:21.165
Totally.

01:21.199 --> 01:22.767
And yet, it sends a very strong
and clear message

01:22.801 --> 01:24.101
to my co-workers

01:24.136 --> 01:26.203
that this dude could rock out
with his cock out.

01:26.238 --> 01:27.438
But when he's done,

01:27.472 --> 01:29.340
he can tuck it away
and get down to biz.

01:29.374 --> 01:32.243
- My thoughts exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

01:32.277 --> 01:34.045
Wear it well on your first day.

01:34.079 --> 01:36.847
I shall, my love.
Thank you so much.

01:39.418 --> 01:41.085
I'm very proud of you.

01:41.119 --> 01:43.654
Why?
'Cause I got a stinkin' job?

01:43.689 --> 01:44.849
If I'd known it was this easy

01:44.856 --> 01:46.524
to make your bosom swelleth
with pride,

01:46.558 --> 01:49.260
I would have applied for a job
at Starbucks long ago.

01:49.294 --> 01:52.296
- Barista.
- No, it's not just the job.

01:52.331 --> 01:55.199
You're finally ready
to embrace change, I think.

01:55.233 --> 01:58.235
Well, the times,
they are a-changing,

01:58.270 --> 01:59.904
whether I likes it or not.

01:59.938 --> 02:03.741
And change is...

02:03.775 --> 02:06.577
- sexy.
- You don't say?

02:06.611 --> 02:08.346
- I do.
- Really?

02:08.380 --> 02:11.515
I do say.

02:11.550 --> 02:14.318
Gosh, golly.

02:14.353 --> 02:17.855
Who knew gainful employ
could be such a panty peeler?

02:17.889 --> 02:19.523
Okay. All right.
All right.

02:19.558 --> 02:25.096
Before--okay, before this
accelerates into heavy petting,

02:25.130 --> 02:27.331
moist humping,
and multiple orgasms

02:27.366 --> 02:29.100
for me, of course,

02:29.134 --> 02:32.236
there's something
I got to tell you.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.571
What?

02:33.605 --> 02:34.839
What?
What is it now?

02:34.873 --> 02:36.107
- Mm--
- I know.

02:36.141 --> 02:38.209
You're a heroin addict.

02:38.243 --> 02:40.611
You have terminal hemorrhoids,
right?

02:40.645 --> 02:42.246
Ow!

02:42.280 --> 02:44.181
I mean, nothing
would surprise me at this point.

02:44.216 --> 02:45.383
Come on.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.785
What is it?

02:47.819 --> 02:49.520
Ah, nothing?

02:49.554 --> 02:50.588
Nope.

02:50.622 --> 02:52.023
Not a twitch.

02:52.057 --> 02:54.759
I even tossed his salad
for a second or three.

02:54.793 --> 02:56.227
Kid lives for fucking ass play.

02:56.261 --> 02:58.763
Ugh! You think this is maybe
psychological?

02:58.797 --> 03:00.231
I don't know.

03:00.265 --> 03:04.001
All I know is that it was like
sucking on a little hotdog

03:04.036 --> 03:05.469
wrapped in foreskin.

03:06.671 --> 03:09.540
And the more I sucked,
the smaller it got.

03:09.574 --> 03:13.210
It felt wrong,
like I was blowing a baby.

03:13.245 --> 03:16.013
A big, bald, unemployable baby.

03:16.048 --> 03:18.382
Look at the four of us.

03:18.417 --> 03:21.318
Ain't love fucking grand?
Huh?

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074

04:06.731 --> 04:08.632
How'd she take it?

04:08.667 --> 04:09.834
I was just about
to lay it on her

04:09.868 --> 04:11.268
when you sulked into the room

04:11.303 --> 04:13.170
with all your
broken weiner sadness.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.239
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

04:15.273 --> 04:17.108
No, it's okay.
It's probably for the best.

04:17.142 --> 04:18.709
'Cause we surely
would have made the love,

04:18.743 --> 04:20.543
and that surely
would have been spectacular,

04:20.579 --> 04:22.446
and then she surely would have
been super fucking pissed

04:22.481 --> 04:24.482
when she found out
I allegedly fathered a son

04:24.516 --> 04:26.550
with another woman, allegedly.

04:26.585 --> 04:27.885
Jesus!

04:27.919 --> 04:29.487
It sounds uncool when I say it
out loud like that.

04:29.521 --> 04:31.889
Why?
You got a son, man!

04:31.923 --> 04:33.491
Someone to carry on
the moodiness

04:33.525 --> 04:35.159
for generations to come.

04:35.193 --> 04:37.495
- Doesn't that feel amazing?
- Not really.

04:37.529 --> 04:38.796
The kid's kind of annoying.

04:38.830 --> 04:39.930
I mean, super fucking annoying

04:39.965 --> 04:41.232
like he should be your son
and not mine.

04:42.601 --> 04:44.435
See, the little fucker
keeps trying to Facetime me.

04:44.469 --> 04:45.736
Look at that.

04:45.770 --> 04:48.839
He shall be Levon,
and I shall decline that shit.

04:48.874 --> 04:51.208
So who's the mom?

04:51.243 --> 04:52.910
Oh, this woman, Julia,
I was seeing at the time.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.079
Wanted to be an actress.
She was gorgeous.

04:55.113 --> 04:58.149
We had a lot of fun.
In and out of the boudoir.

04:58.183 --> 04:59.350
I remember that.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.485
And then I met and quickly
impregnated Karen,

05:01.520 --> 05:02.720
and that, as they say, was that.

05:02.754 --> 05:04.855
By the way, what the fuck
are you doing here?

05:04.890 --> 05:07.224
I wanted to make sure you
showed up for work, you know,

05:07.259 --> 05:09.760
on time, reasonably sober.

05:09.794 --> 05:11.795
You're gonna be pulling in
a weekly salary now.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.265
15% of your weekly is my weekly.

05:14.299 --> 05:15.866
15%?
I thought you got 10.

05:15.901 --> 05:17.768
Mm-mm.
Managers take 15.

05:17.802 --> 05:20.337
Oh, so you're my manager now?
What's the difference?

05:20.372 --> 05:21.338
5%.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.607
That is fucking pathetic,
Charlie.

05:23.642 --> 05:25.743
Maybe you should think about
getting some other clients.

05:25.777 --> 05:27.178
Yeah, well, that's
the other reason I'm here.

05:27.212 --> 05:29.747
Okay.
Let me look at you.

05:29.781 --> 05:31.949
Let me drink you in, big boy.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.617
So what if you got
a dysfunctional dong?

05:33.652 --> 05:35.653
So what if your cock
is but a vestigial organ?

05:35.687 --> 05:37.421
You're still a fucking shark!

05:37.455 --> 05:39.323
- Let's do this!
- No!

05:39.357 --> 05:40.758
No what?

05:40.792 --> 05:43.093
No, this is my first day
of work, Charlie, not yours.

05:43.128 --> 05:45.462
Mine.
I can't let you fuck my shit up.

05:45.497 --> 05:49.533
I still love you, though.
Long time.

05:54.239 --> 05:57.007
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

05:57.042 --> 05:58.242
Hey. Hank.

05:58.276 --> 05:59.677
- Terry.
- Right on.

05:59.711 --> 06:00.844
- Whoa!
- Oh!

06:00.879 --> 06:02.713
That's a powerful grip
you got there.

06:02.747 --> 06:04.181
Quite a handshake.
Very firm.

06:04.216 --> 06:06.550
Very firm indeed.

06:06.585 --> 06:10.354
Where do you work out?

06:10.388 --> 06:11.789
Fuck.

06:13.925 --> 06:15.426
Welcome.

06:15.460 --> 06:16.860
Hey. Hank.

06:16.895 --> 06:19.263
Hugh.

06:19.297 --> 06:20.998
Are you into cupcakes?

06:21.032 --> 06:22.866
I suppose.

06:22.901 --> 06:24.702
There's some in the kitchen.

06:24.736 --> 06:26.003
Right on.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.839
Sometimes Rath
gets a little grumpy.

06:28.873 --> 06:30.074
I like to cheer him up
with cupcakes.

06:30.108 --> 06:31.575
It's the little things.

06:31.610 --> 06:34.745
Well, aren't you
the thoughtful little beaver.

06:34.779 --> 06:37.181
So what's the deal
with Victor/Victoria?

06:37.215 --> 06:38.782
What do you mean?

06:38.817 --> 06:40.251
What do you mean
what do I mean? Terry.

06:40.285 --> 06:43.621
What's up with that,
her/him gender-wise?

06:43.655 --> 06:45.756
Oh, that.
Of course.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.725
Okay, so here's the deal.
It's--

06:49.894 --> 06:52.296
Hey, Terry.
You want a cupcake?

06:52.330 --> 06:53.764
There's some in the kitchen.

06:53.798 --> 06:56.367
Fuck you
and your fucking cupcakes, Hugh!

06:56.401 --> 06:58.869
Get a fucking life.

06:58.903 --> 07:00.137
Okay, cool.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.472
I'm gonna go work on
some story ideas.

07:01.506 --> 07:03.741
I'll see you in the room, kids.

07:03.775 --> 07:06.510
"Fuck you," you said.
That was funny.

07:06.544 --> 07:08.445
So, Terry, tell me a bit
about yourself.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.614
You married?
You have kids?

07:10.649 --> 07:12.650
I'm in a long-term
relationship,

07:12.684 --> 07:15.219
and these are my kids.

07:15.253 --> 07:18.822
Ah, ha, ha, little drooly,
but I see the resemblance.

07:21.426 --> 07:23.494
Oh, I shall decl--fuck!

07:23.528 --> 07:24.895
Facetime!

07:24.929 --> 07:26.169
You got to stop calling me, kid.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.765
Why?

07:27.799 --> 07:30.000
- Because I'm working.
- But you're my father.

07:30.035 --> 07:32.236
Yeah, well, we don't actually
know that for sure.

07:32.270 --> 07:34.305
Calling me a liar?

07:34.339 --> 07:35.806
No, not technically.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.808
You're a real fucking
asshole, you know that?

07:37.842 --> 07:39.677
Now you sound like my kid.

07:39.711 --> 07:40.978
Want to hang out?

07:41.012 --> 07:42.913
No, I can't.
I'm working.

07:42.947 --> 07:44.081
Cool.
Where you working at?

07:44.115 --> 07:45.215
A television show.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.817
Cool!
Which one?

07:46.851 --> 07:47.985
<i>Santa Monica Cop.</i>

07:48.019 --> 07:49.299
Is that like <i>Beverly Hills Cop?</i>

07:49.321 --> 07:51.755
No, it's set in Santa Monica.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.124
- Can I come see you?
- No, I'm busy.

07:54.159 --> 07:55.526
Can you get me a job there?

07:55.560 --> 07:58.128
No.
I barely have a job here.

07:58.163 --> 07:59.330
Hey, guys.

07:59.364 --> 08:00.664
Rath's stuck in a meeting
at the network,

08:00.699 --> 08:02.499
so feel free to do whatever
until lunch.

08:02.534 --> 08:04.501
Cool!
You want to come over?

08:14.079 --> 08:15.212
I'm sorry.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.607
Have you been knocking
for a while?

08:16.614 --> 08:17.881
I was listening to some tunes.

08:17.916 --> 08:20.250
No, no, I pretty much
just knocked the once,

08:20.285 --> 08:21.618
and then you immediately
opened the door,

08:21.653 --> 08:22.786
which leads me to believe

08:22.821 --> 08:24.021
you were just right there
waiting for me.

08:24.055 --> 08:25.656
You totally got me.

08:25.690 --> 08:26.924
I was pretty fucking excited.

08:26.958 --> 08:30.694
Hey, this is for you.

08:30.729 --> 08:33.697
Oh, all right.

08:33.732 --> 08:35.799
Good man.
All right.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.634
There you go.

08:41.873 --> 08:43.173
Nice place you got here.

08:43.207 --> 08:45.409
Yeah, you know, it's home.

08:45.443 --> 08:48.479
Wow! Your mom.

08:48.513 --> 08:50.481
I got to say
she's still smoking hot.

08:50.515 --> 08:52.249
Yeah, people say that
all the time.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.218
I guess I just don't see her
that way.

08:54.252 --> 08:55.719
Right.
Because she's your mom.

08:55.754 --> 08:59.323
I'm just commenting as someone,
you know, who knew her when...

08:59.357 --> 09:00.858
- Okay, then.
- About her beauty.

09:00.892 --> 09:02.059
That's your thing.

09:02.093 --> 09:03.594
Well--

09:03.628 --> 09:06.597
you sure do have a lot
of pictures of your mom around.

09:06.631 --> 09:10.234
And I'm guessing that you don't
have too many girls over, huh?

09:10.268 --> 09:12.603
No. No, I don't.

09:12.637 --> 09:15.038
Which is a source
of great sadness for me,

09:15.073 --> 09:17.207
but the pictures
are my mom's thing.

09:17.242 --> 09:19.109
She likes having them around,
I guess.

09:19.144 --> 09:20.444
You're a grown
man-child, dude.

09:20.478 --> 09:21.945
You can do whatevs you want.

09:21.980 --> 09:24.515
Yeah, I guess, but I still
have to respect her wishes,

09:24.549 --> 09:25.849
you know.

09:25.884 --> 09:26.884
She's my mom.

09:26.918 --> 09:28.552
Sure, I suppose,

09:28.586 --> 09:31.088
if you want
to be all queer about it.

09:32.991 --> 09:34.825
You have a roommate?

09:36.127 --> 09:39.797
Levon, did you take
my toothpaste again?

09:42.967 --> 09:44.535
What the fuck?

09:44.569 --> 09:46.970
I couldn't have said it
any better myself.

09:47.005 --> 09:50.307
Mom, dad, don't be mad.

09:50.341 --> 09:53.710
Uh, if it's any consolation,
I was just commenting to the boy

09:53.745 --> 09:57.514
that you still got it, you know,
you're still smoking hot.

09:57.549 --> 10:01.418
Oh, my God.

10:01.453 --> 10:03.754
- You live with your mom.
- Obviously.

10:03.788 --> 10:05.255
You don't think you could
have mentioned that?

10:05.290 --> 10:06.390
Would you have still me over?

10:06.424 --> 10:07.658
- Probably not.
- See?

10:07.692 --> 10:09.660
I did the right thing then.

10:09.694 --> 10:13.497
Does she know
that you made contact?

10:13.531 --> 10:14.765
She does now.

10:14.799 --> 10:16.767
Sweet jumping Jesus.

10:16.801 --> 10:18.969
Levon, can you come in here
a minute, please?

10:19.003 --> 10:20.938
Coming, mom!

10:20.972 --> 10:23.907
Sit, stay.
I'll be right back.

10:23.942 --> 10:28.178
Eat some of those cold cuts.
I made them for you.

10:28.213 --> 10:31.915
Hey, don't leave, okay?
Again.

10:39.824 --> 10:41.124
What the fuck
were you thinking?!

10:45.096 --> 10:46.997
- Hank.
- Hi, Julia.

10:47.031 --> 10:50.634
- It's great to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

10:50.668 --> 10:52.436
I'll be in touch.

10:52.470 --> 10:53.704
How do you mean?

10:53.738 --> 10:56.073
This is just a lot
to process right now.

10:56.107 --> 10:57.241
- Yes.
- I think I need some time.

10:57.275 --> 10:58.876
Yeah, I get that.
I get that.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.310
I get that.

11:00.345 --> 11:03.080
So he's--I'm guessing
that he's really mine?

11:03.114 --> 11:05.048
- What?
- He's really my kid?

11:05.083 --> 11:08.218
I mean, all I have is his word
to go on,

11:08.253 --> 11:09.853
and no offense,
but he doesn't present

11:09.888 --> 11:11.622
as the most trustworthy source.

11:11.656 --> 11:13.290
I'm standing right here.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.925
Okay, yeah, fuck.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.260
Shit.

11:16.294 --> 11:18.962
- I'm still standing here.
- Please leave.

11:18.997 --> 11:22.366
I could--I don't have to be
back at work for a few minutes.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.635
- We could sit and talk.
- Oh, God.

11:24.669 --> 11:26.770
Or--or--or I could go.

11:26.804 --> 11:29.406
Going, going, gone.
Okay.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.408
- Levon, always a pleasure.
- Bye, dad.

11:31.442 --> 11:33.043
Catch you
on the flippity-flop.

11:38.082 --> 11:40.317
That's a good-looking Sammie
you got there, Hank.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.885
I went with the burger.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.160
That's the move from this place.

11:43.187 --> 11:45.422
I'm pretty happy
about my lunch order right now.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.291
Killed it.

11:47.325 --> 11:49.393
- This is gluten-free, right?
- I'd stake my life on it.

11:49.427 --> 11:51.995
And it hasn't been in
the vicinity of any shellfish?

11:52.030 --> 11:54.398
I watched them cook it
just like you asked.

11:54.432 --> 11:55.832
Thank you.
I don't mean to be a nudge.

11:55.867 --> 11:57.601
Yeah, we got it, Goldie, okay?

11:57.635 --> 11:58.835
Hey, look at me.

11:58.870 --> 12:00.337
I'm allergic to fucking
everything, all right?

12:00.371 --> 12:01.738
Maybe you should
brown bag it tomorrow.

12:01.773 --> 12:04.107
Make yourself a little PB&J
or something.

12:04.142 --> 12:05.876
I have a severe nut allergy.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.644
- Yeah, of course you do.
- I could die.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.279
That would be a shame.

12:13.918 --> 12:15.485
What the fuck are you doing?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.120
Taking a picture of my burger.

12:17.155 --> 12:18.589
Why the fuck are you taking
a picture of your burger?

12:18.623 --> 12:20.263
'Cause I want to put it
on my instagram.

12:20.291 --> 12:21.258
Oh, you're gonna put it
on your instagram.

12:21.292 --> 12:22.492
Of course.
Well, that makes sense.

12:22.527 --> 12:24.227
- Yeah.
- It's a beautiful burger.

12:24.262 --> 12:25.462
- Yeah, #lunch.
- I know, right?

12:25.496 --> 12:27.364
Yeah. Yeah.
Absolutely.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.266
It's a gorgeous burger.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.634
So let me get this straight.

12:30.668 --> 12:33.337
It's not enough
that I have to watch you chew

12:33.371 --> 12:35.205
with your mouth open
every fucking day.

12:35.239 --> 12:37.274
Now I'm gonna have
to watch you play Diane Arbus

12:37.308 --> 12:38.775
with your food?

12:38.810 --> 12:41.278
How about I bring some starving
African kid in here,

12:41.312 --> 12:44.114
have him watch you take
a picture of your gourmet burger

12:44.148 --> 12:46.350
with your fucking iPhone?

12:46.384 --> 12:47.784
Ought to be ashamed of yourself.

12:47.819 --> 12:49.386
Maybe you should spend
a little less time

12:49.420 --> 12:51.054
sexualizing your lunch,

12:51.089 --> 12:52.422
and a little more time coming up

12:52.457 --> 12:54.124
with a workable fucking
story idea.

12:54.158 --> 12:55.692
Come on, Rath.

12:55.727 --> 12:57.194
I pitched you five
brand-new ideas this morning.

12:57.228 --> 12:59.062
And every one of them
sucked, man!

12:59.097 --> 13:00.230
Do better!

13:00.264 --> 13:02.065
Stop instagraming,
stop tweeting!

13:02.100 --> 13:04.301
I do read them, you know,

13:04.335 --> 13:05.969
when I'm in the mood
for a raging hate-boner.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.772
Hank, you're awfully quiet
over there.

13:08.806 --> 13:10.073
What's happening?

13:10.108 --> 13:11.708
Sorry, usually,
I'm a fucking firecracker,

13:11.743 --> 13:13.910
but I'm just dealing
with some heavy shit right now.

13:13.945 --> 13:15.145
Tell us.

13:15.179 --> 13:16.647
I'd rather not.

13:16.681 --> 13:17.981
Hank, this is
what we do in here.

13:18.016 --> 13:19.282
This is church.

13:19.317 --> 13:21.652
This is where we confess
our deepest, darkest secrets,

13:21.686 --> 13:22.919
shoot 'em through a prism,

13:22.954 --> 13:24.054
put 'em up there on the screen.

13:24.088 --> 13:25.255
Oh, God.

13:25.289 --> 13:26.523
All right, if you must know,

13:26.557 --> 13:29.660
I recently discovered
that I have fathered a son

13:29.694 --> 13:31.995
from a relationship
about 20 years ago.

13:32.030 --> 13:33.230
- Oh, wow!
- Holy shit.

13:33.264 --> 13:34.498
That is fucking heavy.

13:34.532 --> 13:35.732
- Perfect.
- Yikes!

13:35.767 --> 13:38.101
- That makes perfect sense.
- I got a lawyer.

13:38.136 --> 13:40.070
Those 20 years' child support,
you don't want to pay that.

13:40.104 --> 13:41.204
- Okay, people.
- I'll hook you up.

13:41.272 --> 13:42.472
How do we use this on the show?

13:42.507 --> 13:43.774
God.

13:43.808 --> 13:45.909
Okay, so maybe Danko
has a baby with a stranger,

13:45.943 --> 13:48.679
but the stranger happens to be,
like, a cousin from the past.

13:48.713 --> 13:49.780
A retarded cousin.

13:49.814 --> 13:50.847
A retarded cousin from the past.

13:50.882 --> 13:51.882
Can't say "retarded."
Autistic.

13:51.916 --> 13:52.983
An autistic cousin
from the past.

13:53.017 --> 13:54.184
Ooh, ooh, title of the show,
"Aw...

13:54.218 --> 13:55.285
- "Aw...
- "Tistic."

13:55.319 --> 13:56.386
I got it, I got it.

13:56.421 --> 13:57.554
Here, this is
the bad version now.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.722
What if Danko Jones--

13:58.756 --> 13:59.823
Didn't you also
rape a woman once?

13:59.857 --> 14:02.125
- Wow. Harsh!
- Stand down, Terry!

14:02.160 --> 14:04.061
What? It's true.
It was all over the news.

14:04.095 --> 14:05.796
Yeah.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.264
If anybody was raped, it was me,

14:07.298 --> 14:09.099
and it was all just a big
misunderstanding anyway.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.413
It could have happened
to anyone.

14:10.435 --> 14:12.069
Wish it happened to me.
She was really hot.

14:12.103 --> 14:13.570
She's so skinny.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.305
I shouldn't have
to share an office

14:15.339 --> 14:16.406
with a convicted rapist.

14:16.441 --> 14:17.541
What if a wear a cock cage?

14:17.575 --> 14:18.909
I like that.
I like that.

14:20.445 --> 14:21.511
It's a male chastity device.

14:21.546 --> 14:22.713
I need one of those.

14:22.747 --> 14:24.881
It traps your penis
in a flaccid state.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.517
Even Danko could be
in his own cock cage.

14:26.551 --> 14:27.784
It's like he feels trapped

14:27.819 --> 14:29.099
'cause he's
in his own cock cage.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.520
Why?
Why would he be in a cock cage?

14:30.555 --> 14:32.322
Despite all his rage, he is
still just a cock in a cage.

14:32.356 --> 14:33.857
- You think rape is funny?
- No!

14:33.891 --> 14:36.093
I think it's awful, unless
it's a woman raping a man.

14:36.127 --> 14:37.327
That's inherently funny.

14:37.361 --> 14:38.829
- Rath, are you really--
- What?

14:38.863 --> 14:40.497
Are you just gonna sit here
and let this happen?

14:40.531 --> 14:42.032
What are you talking about?

14:42.066 --> 14:43.166
For the first time
in three weeks,

14:43.201 --> 14:44.701
I'm actually enjoying myself.

14:44.736 --> 14:47.337
- Please continue.
- Goldie, are you okay?

14:47.371 --> 14:51.108
That was not gluten-free.

14:52.944 --> 14:55.746
Oh! What the fu--
Goldie?

14:55.780 --> 14:57.581
At least we know it wasn't
all in your head.

14:57.615 --> 14:59.282
My fucking mom just got me
this shit, Goldie!

14:59.317 --> 15:00.684
Jesus fucking Christ!

15:00.718 --> 15:02.919
I've seen crime scenes
less disgusting than that.

15:02.954 --> 15:04.020
I think lunch is over.

15:04.055 --> 15:05.222
They told me it was
gluten-free.

15:05.256 --> 15:06.523
- Clean this shit up!
- Shit!

15:06.557 --> 15:07.657
Clean this shit up!

15:07.692 --> 15:09.092
Disinfect the whole fucking room, okay?

15:09.127 --> 15:10.494
I'm gonna go meditate.

15:10.528 --> 15:12.395
We'll reconvene
in a couple of hours

15:12.430 --> 15:14.931
does anybody know
of a bar around here

15:14.966 --> 15:16.399
where I could meet somebody
for a drink?

15:16.434 --> 15:17.834
God!

15:17.902 --> 15:20.570
I would love a nice wine cooler
right now or like a microbrew.

15:20.605 --> 15:22.439
An allagash white would totally
hit the fucking spot, right?

15:22.473 --> 15:24.174
But here's the thing.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.710
Rath does not like it when we
leave the office during the day.

15:26.744 --> 15:29.112
It's totally frowned upon.
But I'm totes free tonight.

15:29.147 --> 15:30.380
What do you say?
Let's do it!

15:53.771 --> 15:56.273
- Hmm.
- Hi.

15:56.307 --> 15:59.476
Thank you.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.915
How come you never told me?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.718
This is what I remember.

16:08.753 --> 16:12.289
We were running around the city
for a few months, hanging out,

16:12.323 --> 16:14.724
having fun, keeping it simple,

16:14.759 --> 16:16.293
and then one day the phone
stopped ringing.

16:16.327 --> 16:18.662
And I called you to make sure
you weren't dead,

16:18.696 --> 16:20.197
and you said
you met someone special,

16:20.231 --> 16:21.598
someone that you could picture

16:21.632 --> 16:24.167
spending the rest
of your life with.

16:24.202 --> 16:25.936
I remember not being
all that offended

16:25.970 --> 16:28.605
because we were never really
that together.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.041
So when I realized
I was knocked up,

16:31.075 --> 16:34.411
it seemed pretty pointless
to tell you.

16:34.445 --> 16:36.079
I'm sorry.

16:36.113 --> 16:38.348
No, I'm sorry.

16:38.382 --> 16:39.716
Don't be.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.451
I never expected anything
from you.

16:41.485 --> 16:45.422
You're fun, kind of like driving
around in a car with a dog

16:45.456 --> 16:47.290
who sticks his head
out the window.

16:47.325 --> 16:49.159
What kind of dog?

16:49.193 --> 16:50.827
Not the marrying kind.

16:50.862 --> 16:53.129
Oh, that's--I don't know
that that's a breed.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.754
I don't see a ring
on your finger.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.337
- Did you ever get hitched?
- Uh, no, not technically.

17:00.371 --> 17:02.706
How long have you been here?

17:02.740 --> 17:04.074
A few months.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.076
When Levon came along,

17:06.109 --> 17:07.911
he derailed
the whole acting thing.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.179
Yeah.

17:09.213 --> 17:10.579
So I moved back to the island,

17:10.615 --> 17:13.750
and I went to school,
and I became a dental hygienist.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.117
- Really?
- I fucking love teeth.

17:15.152 --> 17:17.554
They fascinate me.

17:17.588 --> 17:22.358
Open up.

17:22.393 --> 17:23.792
- Ooh.
- Huh?

17:23.828 --> 17:25.161
Have you been
to a dentist recently?

17:25.195 --> 17:27.263
Can we get back to your story?

17:27.298 --> 17:30.667
So Levon decided
he wants to act,

17:30.701 --> 17:32.702
and it seemed like a good time
for a change of scenery.

17:32.737 --> 17:34.571
So here we are.

17:34.605 --> 17:39.009
Yeah.
So where do we go from here?

17:39.043 --> 17:40.543
Nowhere.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.780
I'd really love it
if you bowed out

17:43.814 --> 17:46.917
and never saw him again.

17:46.951 --> 17:48.418
I mean, Levon's a weird kid.

17:48.452 --> 17:50.553
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:52.056 --> 17:53.890
He's got all these crazy
expectations

17:53.925 --> 17:55.792
of you guys making up
for lost time.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.227
I don't have the heart
to tell him

17:57.261 --> 17:59.095
that you're not
that kind of guy.

17:59.130 --> 18:03.566
How do you know
what kind of guy I am now?

18:03.601 --> 18:05.769
Look, I'm giving you
a gift here.

18:05.803 --> 18:08.538
I'm telling you
it's okay to walk away.

18:08.572 --> 18:11.274
I'm asking you nicely
to just do the right thing

18:11.309 --> 18:13.944
and leave us the fuck alone.

18:13.978 --> 18:17.314
Drink's on me.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.958
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

18:27.992 --> 18:29.426
Stu used to pop them
all the time.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.628
Hmm.
Hmm?

18:31.662 --> 18:33.296
Stu has E.D. too?

18:33.331 --> 18:35.932
No, not at all.
He used to take them for fun.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.434
We used to fuck for hours.

18:37.468 --> 18:39.836
His cock was
like a battering ram.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.538
It was like it was made
of liquid metal.

18:41.572 --> 18:43.640
It was the T-1000 of boners.

18:43.674 --> 18:44.908
Okay, Marcy,

18:44.942 --> 18:47.277
I don't know how many times
I can say this,

18:47.311 --> 18:50.680
but your fond remembrance
of your ex-husband's horse cock

18:50.715 --> 18:53.316
does not work wonders
for my fragile psyche.

18:53.351 --> 18:54.951
Pussy!

18:54.986 --> 18:56.286
Shit!
This is Hank.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.587
- No!
- I'm sorry.

18:57.621 --> 18:58.588
- I got to take this.
- No!

18:58.622 --> 18:59.656
I got to take it!

18:59.690 --> 19:00.890
What's up, buddy?

19:00.925 --> 19:02.092
Hey, buddy, I need you
to do me a favor.

19:02.126 --> 19:03.893
Anything at all.
You name it.

19:03.928 --> 19:05.295
Yeah, you got to get me off
of this thing.

19:05.329 --> 19:07.163
- What thing?
- The show.

19:07.198 --> 19:08.865
I just can't do it anymore.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.400
Hank, it's your first day!

19:10.434 --> 19:11.868
I know, but there's
too much shit going on

19:11.902 --> 19:12.936
in my personal life,

19:12.970 --> 19:14.704
and I'm a delicate
fucking flower.

19:14.739 --> 19:16.673
The thought about
getting back in there

19:16.707 --> 19:18.675
with those fucking monkeys
is giving me a fucking migraine.

19:18.709 --> 19:19.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:19.810 --> 19:21.077
Hank, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:21.112 --> 19:23.179
Back in where?
Why aren't you there right now?

19:23.214 --> 19:26.449
- It's a long story.
- Hank, go back in there!

19:26.484 --> 19:27.851
You talk it out with Rath.

19:27.885 --> 19:29.753
He's a cool guy.
He'll understand.

19:29.787 --> 19:32.188
I understand
what you're saying, and I agree,

19:32.223 --> 19:33.623
but that's what I have you for,
Charlie,

19:33.657 --> 19:35.091
to have the conversations
I do not want to have.

19:35.126 --> 19:37.293
That's what the extra 5% is for.

19:37.328 --> 19:39.863
Besides, it's like auditing
a class, right?

19:39.897 --> 19:42.298
I tried it, it wasn't for me.
No harm, no foul.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.600
No, Hank! No!

19:43.634 --> 19:45.535
There is harm,
and there is foul!

19:45.569 --> 19:46.836
Jesus Christ!

19:46.871 --> 19:48.038
I can't believe
you're doing this to me

19:48.072 --> 19:50.206
when I've just taken
a fucking Viagra!

19:50.241 --> 19:51.341
Oh.
Good luck with that.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.675
My mind's made up, though.

19:52.710 --> 19:54.778
Make it happen.
Smooth that shit over.

19:54.812 --> 19:56.713
Hank!

19:58.849 --> 20:00.517
Hank!
Hank!

20:00.551 --> 20:01.885
Thank God you're here.

20:01.919 --> 20:03.620
This motherfucker's trying
to waterboard me! Pig!

20:03.654 --> 20:05.622
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:05.656 --> 20:07.023
Get your fucking hands off me!

20:07.058 --> 20:10.060
- Stop!
- Calm down!

20:10.094 --> 20:11.534
- He's a little retarded.
- A little?

20:11.562 --> 20:13.730
Fuck you, you rent-a-cop
motherfucker!

20:13.764 --> 20:15.031
- You don't--
- What are you doing?

20:15.066 --> 20:16.299
You can't just show up
at a movie studio

20:16.333 --> 20:17.834
and expect to see someone.

20:17.868 --> 20:18.968
But you weren't
answering your phone,

20:19.003 --> 20:20.804
- and I needed to see you.
- Why?

20:20.838 --> 20:23.473
I think my mother's trying
to keep us apart.

20:23.507 --> 20:24.974
Why do you say that?

20:25.009 --> 20:26.543
'Cause I think she's afraid
she's gonna lose me

20:26.577 --> 20:28.044
if I develop
a relationship with you.

20:28.079 --> 20:30.480
Well, maybe she's just afraid
that I'll disappoint you.

20:30.514 --> 20:31.981
That's impossible.
You're my father, right?

20:32.016 --> 20:34.350
You'd never let me down.

20:34.385 --> 20:36.019
What has she told you about me?

20:36.053 --> 20:37.420
Not much.

20:37.455 --> 20:38.655
Just that she got knocked up

20:38.689 --> 20:40.290
by some guy
she didn't know very well,

20:40.324 --> 20:42.192
a guy who didn't seem like
much of a father figure.

20:42.226 --> 20:43.426
But you know what?

20:43.461 --> 20:46.496
You never knew,
so I thought maybe you should.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.131
I don't know.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.100
I never told her
I was trying to find you.

20:50.134 --> 20:51.434
I didn't want to hurt
her feelings.

20:51.469 --> 20:53.429
But I did my research,
and when we moved out here,

20:53.437 --> 20:55.238
I knew that was my opportunity
to come find you.

20:56.907 --> 21:00.043
You know, your mom has done a
pretty good job all by herself.

21:00.077 --> 21:03.346
Yeah, she's pretty cool,
don't get me wrong.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.914
It's just being raised
by a single mom

21:04.949 --> 21:06.483
has made me
really fucking weird.

21:06.517 --> 21:08.818
I don't even know
how to relate to other guys.

21:08.853 --> 21:10.887
She didn't have
any boyfriends around?

21:10.921 --> 21:13.690
Some.
I'm sure I scared them away.

21:13.724 --> 21:15.859
Yeah, you're a lot
of responsibility.

21:15.893 --> 21:17.927
You're like
a walking boner killer.

21:17.962 --> 21:20.430
I don't even know
how to deal with girls.

21:20.464 --> 21:22.732
I paid this chick one time
to take off her top.

21:22.766 --> 21:24.100
She let me jerk off
in front of her.

21:24.135 --> 21:25.435
- I finished right on her feet.
- That's too much.

21:25.469 --> 21:26.636
I'm not as cool
as you might think.

21:26.670 --> 21:27.871
That's too much.
That's enough.

21:27.905 --> 21:29.639
- Look, I need help, Hank.
- You know what I think?

21:29.673 --> 21:31.808
I think you'd get along famously
with your Uncle Charlie.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.910
Look...

21:33.944 --> 21:36.246
I know this is pretty much
the last thing you wanted

21:36.280 --> 21:37.480
out of life.

21:37.515 --> 21:39.048
I know there's nothing cute
or charming

21:39.083 --> 21:40.350
about me showing up
on your doorstep.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.719
It's just reading about you,

21:42.753 --> 21:44.921
you seemed like
a really cool guy,

21:44.955 --> 21:48.925
and I guess I just wanted to get
to know you a little bit.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.560
I thought maybe
some of your cool

21:50.594 --> 21:53.296
would rub off on me
or something.

21:54.498 --> 21:57.000
You want to see where I work?

21:57.034 --> 22:01.004
Are you kidding me?
I'd love to.

22:01.038 --> 22:03.339
That's right, motherfuckers!
Die, pigs, die!

22:03.374 --> 22:05.675
Leave it!
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

22:05.709 --> 22:09.512
Oh, my God!
They have a foosball table here.

22:09.547 --> 22:10.980
Hank, what the fuck, man?

22:11.015 --> 22:12.382
- What?
- What?

22:12.416 --> 22:13.850
Your dipshit agent
just called me,

22:13.884 --> 22:15.451
said you were in a car accident.

22:15.486 --> 22:16.920
Ah, you can't listen to a word
that guy says.

22:16.954 --> 22:18.388
He's mentally ill.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.789
I just keep him around so he
doesn't blow his brains out.

22:19.823 --> 22:21.925
I am sorry
for getting back late though.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.459
Thought maybe you went out
for a pack of smokes

22:23.494 --> 22:24.994
and decided TV wasn't for you.

22:25.029 --> 22:26.262
What?

22:26.297 --> 22:28.765
That'd be crazy,
not to mention unprofessional.

22:28.799 --> 22:30.733
I'm here, I'm queer,
get used to it.

22:30.768 --> 22:32.602
I just wanted to show
this young man

22:32.636 --> 22:34.437
what I do for a living.

22:34.471 --> 22:36.873
- Oh, is this your kid?
- Apparently.

22:36.907 --> 22:39.742
- Is he--
- On the spectrum?

22:39.777 --> 22:41.544
Probably, but aren't we all?

22:41.579 --> 22:43.012
Does he want a job?

22:43.047 --> 22:45.548
Because I just promoted the P.A.
to writer's assistant.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.218
He wanted a reward
for cleaning up all that puke.

22:48.252 --> 22:50.353
Kids today, you know,
they're so fucking entitled.

22:50.387 --> 22:52.388
Hey, hey, I remember this show.

22:52.423 --> 22:53.890
Oh, yeah, you like that one?

22:53.924 --> 22:55.191
It was awful.

22:55.226 --> 22:57.760
Like, really bad.
Like, who-writes-that-shit bad.

22:57.795 --> 23:00.063
- Just terrible.
- I write that shit.

23:00.097 --> 23:01.698
I created that show.

23:01.732 --> 23:03.900
- Oh, sorry.
- No, you're right.

23:03.934 --> 23:06.502
The show sucked.
It sucked hard.

23:06.537 --> 23:08.071
Never got the casting right.

23:08.105 --> 23:10.506
Much like life,
it's all in the fucking casting.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.243
- Hank? Oh, my God!
- Get a load of this cunt.

23:13.277 --> 23:16.613
- Hank, thank God you're alive.
- Shh.

23:16.647 --> 23:18.548
I guess it was just
a fender bender after all.

23:18.582 --> 23:20.750
Shut the fuck up, Charlie.
Shut the fuck up.

23:20.784 --> 23:22.285
What?

23:22.319 --> 23:23.920
Oh! Levon!

23:23.954 --> 23:26.022
Hey, it's Uncle Charlie,
remember?

23:26.056 --> 23:28.224
- It's great to see you...
- What is wrong with this thing?

23:28.259 --> 23:31.494
Again.

23:31.528 --> 23:33.463
Will you get a load of that?

23:38.836 --> 23:41.104
Hank...

23:41.138 --> 23:44.073
I think it's working.
The little blue pill worked.

23:44.108 --> 23:45.575
I think I'm getting hard.

23:45.609 --> 23:47.510
Behave yourself, you animal.

23:47.544 --> 23:49.012
Oh, oh, that.

23:49.046 --> 23:50.546
Oh, good!
Good for you.

23:50.581 --> 23:52.315
Good for you
and your thin, veiny dong.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.983
My heart's beating
really fast, Hank.

23:54.018 --> 23:55.685
It's kind of freaking me out.
Here, feel.

23:55.719 --> 23:56.853
No, I'm not gonna feel anything.

23:56.887 --> 23:58.254
- It's just an erection.
- Feel it. Feel.

23:58.289 --> 23:59.422
You've had a million of them,
and you botched them all.

23:59.456 --> 24:01.557
I'm feeling very dizzy, Hank.
Call 911.

24:01.592 --> 24:03.860
- It's a massive coronary event.
- No, it's not.

24:03.894 --> 24:05.495
- Call 911.
- It's not.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.197
Call 911!
It's a massive coronary event!

24:08.232 --> 24:10.600
Call 911!
Please!

24:10.634 --> 24:12.001
This is it, Hank.
This is it.

24:12.036 --> 24:14.170
- No, it's not.
- What's with the boner?

24:14.204 --> 24:15.705
Whoa!

24:15.739 --> 24:17.373
Seriously, Hank,
you need a new fucking agent.

24:17.408 --> 24:19.709
- He's my manager now.
- Are you okay?

24:19.743 --> 24:21.344
Is there anything
I could do to help?

24:21.378 --> 24:26.816
God, you smell good.
Ha, ha.

24:26.850 --> 24:28.918
- Oh!
- Holy shit!

24:28.952 --> 24:30.486
Did he just cum in his pants?

24:30.521 --> 24:33.122
Ahh.

24:49.206 --> 24:50.873
Quit stalking me, lady.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.975
Levon told me where you lived.

24:53.010 --> 24:54.377
Of course he did.

24:55.779 --> 24:59.315
Wow!

24:59.350 --> 25:00.917
He also told me
what you did for him.

25:00.951 --> 25:03.653
Oh, yeah, that's just
a lowly P.A. job.

25:03.687 --> 25:05.488
He's gonna be cleaning up
a lot of puke.

25:05.522 --> 25:07.657
Thanks for ignoring
everything I said.

25:07.691 --> 25:09.959
That's what I do.

25:09.993 --> 25:11.427
I'm--no, I'm sorry.

25:11.462 --> 25:12.895
No, I mean it.
Thank you.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.764
Thanks.

25:14.798 --> 25:17.166
It's good to see him
so excited about something.

25:17.201 --> 25:19.369
I'm sorry about earlier.

25:19.403 --> 25:21.003
My defenses were up.
Mother bear issues, I guess.

25:21.038 --> 25:23.072
No, it's totally understandable.

25:23.107 --> 25:27.410
This is uncharted territory
for both of us.

25:27.444 --> 25:31.314
More for me, 'cause I just
found out that I have a child.

25:31.348 --> 25:33.416
- You've known for 20 years.
- I'm not used to

25:33.450 --> 25:37.553
having the guy involved, but--
so do you play guitar?

25:37.588 --> 25:39.722
Uh, not really.

25:39.757 --> 25:44.293
It's more like I callous myself
in the pursuit of happiness.

25:44.328 --> 25:47.563
Play something.

25:51.535 --> 25:53.102
I'm too shy, actually.

25:53.137 --> 25:56.239
I don't remember you being shy.

25:57.408 --> 25:59.609
- Excuse me.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

26:04.148 --> 26:06.949
Hey, how was the first day?

26:06.984 --> 26:08.818
What?

26:08.852 --> 26:11.487
Oh, baby, was it that bad?

26:11.522 --> 26:13.689
What are you doing?

26:13.724 --> 26:15.425
Tell me.

26:15.459 --> 26:18.202
Baby, there's someone
you got to meet.

26:18.322 --> 26:19.604
Uh-huh.

26:24.201 --> 26:27.370
Oh, no.
