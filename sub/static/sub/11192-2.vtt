00:05.000 --> 00:09.627
Gentlemen, these planets,
designated P3-575 and P3A-577,

00:09.519 --> 00:13.980
have been submitted by Carter's team
as destinations for your next mission.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.916
SG units one and two
will operate concurrently.

00:16.879 --> 00:22.335
You know, I'm kinda partial to P3-575,
if you don't mind taking P3A-577.

00:22.199 --> 00:24.986
- I'll take 577.
- I'm not married to it. I wanna be fair.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.746
- Let's flip for it.
- How about you go where I tell you?

00:27.719 --> 00:30.471
<i>- As far as I'm...
- Inbound traveller.</i>

00:30.439 --> 00:33.475
<i>Repeat, inbound traveller.</i>

00:33.439 --> 00:35.764
Damn. Those Goa'ulds are persistent.

00:35.759 --> 00:40.171
- I think we pissed them off.
- Closing the iris.

00:45.639 --> 00:48.674
Alert! All defence teams, stand by!

00:48.718 --> 00:52.881
Set the base autodestruct
countdown at three minutes.

01:12.397 --> 01:15.313
I'm not goin' anywhere
if the Goa'ulds keep attacking.

01:15.278 --> 01:17.400
They can't keep this up for ever.

01:18.156 --> 01:21.073
- Can they?
- Whoa!

01:21.037 --> 01:24.037
Once they see our gate's impenetrable,
they'll give up.

01:23.995 --> 01:29.120
Part of me just wants to let 'em through.
Give 'em the fight they're lookin' for.

01:38.634 --> 01:40.710
Radiation team, move in.

01:46.754 --> 01:50.539
Well, there have gotta be
worse ways to go, I suppose.

01:50.474 --> 01:53.558
<i>You don't think the Goa'ulds
are sending people through?</i>

01:53.515 --> 01:56.052
Be like bugs on a windshield.

01:58.754 --> 02:03.132
<i>- Team reports all clear, sir.
- Stand down. Abort the countdown.</i>

02:16.873 --> 02:19.790
Kawalsky, what's the matter?

02:19.752 --> 02:22.836
Headache. I took a fistful of aspirin,
but nothin' helps.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.752
Get down to the infirmary,
get it checked out.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.750
Sir, I think I'll do that.
Sir, with your permission.

02:28.713 --> 02:33.293
By all means, Major.
I need you to lead your team to P3-575.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.920
<i>Inbound traveller!</i>

02:41.912 --> 02:44.948
Reset the count. Here we go again.

02:44.912 --> 02:47.485
All defence teams, remain in position.

02:55.752 --> 02:58.420
So this iris is gonna hold, right?

02:58.391 --> 03:01.760
Pure titanium, three micrometres
from the event horizon.

03:01.711 --> 03:04.082
It won't even allow matter to reintegrate.

03:04.072 --> 03:06.562
So this iris is gonna hold, right?

03:07.510 --> 03:11.342
If not, the fail-safe device will detonate,
this mountain'll vaporise

03:11.271 --> 03:14.474
- And there'll be nothing to worry about.
- Ah, good.

03:14.431 --> 03:16.305
I feel much better.

04:23.149 --> 04:24.608
<i>Come.</i>

04:27.947 --> 04:32.158
I can understand how Kawalsky feels.
This job gives me a headache, too.

04:32.228 --> 04:37.055
- Uh-huh. What's the bad news, General?
- Not much for small talk, are you?

04:37.586 --> 04:40.125
How was your weekend?
Get any fishing in?

04:40.105 --> 04:45.064
I'm rejecting your request to have
Teal'c join SG-1. Wasn't my choice.

04:44.946 --> 04:47.615
Colonel Kennedy
is en route from the Pentagon

04:47.588 --> 04:50.504
- To ask your friend some questions.
- What questions?

04:50.466 --> 04:53.170
Troop strength, technology, weaponry.

04:53.146 --> 04:56.846
I'd like to know the answers, too,
but after they're done askin'...

04:56.786 --> 04:59.740
There'll be more questions, possibly tests.

04:59.706 --> 05:05.411
After all, he's carrying the larval form of a
hostile and formidable enemy in his body.

05:07.105 --> 05:09.312
What kind of tests are we talking about?

05:10.464 --> 05:15.708
Maybe you haven't noticed, but he is the
first alien species we've actually run into.

05:15.584 --> 05:18.750
Doesn't it qualify him
as a subject of scientific interest?

05:18.865 --> 05:21.153
<i>- A subject?
- He is what he is, Colonel.</i>

05:21.144 --> 05:22.887
With all due respect, sir,

05:22.903 --> 05:26.605
I don't think he saved the lives of my team
or came over to our side

05:26.545 --> 05:29.461
to become a guinea pig
for US military intelligence!

05:29.423 --> 05:33.207
Back up, Colonel.
He switched sides once.

05:33.144 --> 05:36.927
- Are you positive he won't switch back?
- Yes, sir.

05:37.105 --> 05:40.021
Well, you are alone in that assertion.

05:39.983 --> 05:42.106
Colonel Kennedy arrives in an hour.

05:42.103 --> 05:45.307
I promise Teal'c will be
treated with dignity and respect

05:45.264 --> 05:48.182
for as long as he remains
a guest of this facility.

05:48.144 --> 05:50.930
Beyond that, I can't promise a damn thing.

05:50.903 --> 05:52.978
Dismissed, Colonel.

06:07.944 --> 06:11.276
Hey. Am I interrupting anything?

06:11.221 --> 06:13.096
Yes.

06:14.543 --> 06:16.867
Why don't I come back?

06:16.862 --> 06:19.353
The people from Chulak...

06:19.341 --> 06:23.386
We sent the last of 'em back
before the Goa'ulds knocked at the door.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.112
- Good.
- Thanks to you.

06:29.341 --> 06:32.129
So, how long do you think
they'll keep it up?

06:33.901 --> 06:36.391
One, perhaps two more attempts.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.584
They will believe their weapons
have destroyed you.

06:40.540 --> 06:44.538
They will not send warriors through yet
to make sure of your destruction.

06:44.461 --> 06:47.165
Well, they'll be in for a surprise, huh?

06:47.139 --> 06:51.718
Your iris will be closed.
They will be crushed.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.494
Surprise!

06:56.461 --> 06:58.915
Am I a prisoner?

06:58.899 --> 07:01.105
Uh...

07:01.100 --> 07:02.973
Yeah.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.232
I understand.

07:07.218 --> 07:11.382
We're not exactly living up
to your expectations of us, are we?

07:14.939 --> 07:20.444
See, Teal'c, we've been living alone in our
little corner of the galaxy for quite a while.

07:20.298 --> 07:25.922
And I think... The people I work for
just need to get to know you a little better.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.531
Your knowledge of the Goa'ulds
makes them curious.

07:28.497 --> 07:32.281
- I will give that knowledge freely.
- I know, and we'll put it to good use.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.004
I will pledge my allegiance to this world.

07:34.978 --> 07:39.723
I'm just not sure that's ever
gonna be enough for them to trust you.

07:39.617 --> 07:42.572
To be honest with you,
I think they're scared of you.

07:45.018 --> 07:47.175
I understand.

07:47.177 --> 07:49.930
You must be used to that by now, huh?

07:49.898 --> 07:52.733
I am a Jaffa.

07:52.697 --> 07:56.029
I have served as a warrior for your enemy.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.302
I have carried your enemy within me.

07:59.576 --> 08:02.031
Yeah.

08:02.016 --> 08:04.971
Well, it's kind of a human thing.

08:04.937 --> 08:07.509
We tend to be afraid
of things we don't know.

08:07.497 --> 08:09.987
Why is O'Neill not afraid?

08:11.216 --> 08:16.009
Teal'c, I saw you stand up to a God.
You refused to kill.

08:15.896 --> 08:20.108
- I saw you make that decision.
- Yes.

08:20.216 --> 08:23.632
In that moment I learned everything
I needed to know to trust you.

08:23.576 --> 08:27.240
If I had killed you then,
I would not be here now.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.312
Neither would I.

08:30.295 --> 08:32.537
I will prove my allegiance, O'Neill.

08:32.534 --> 08:35.025
Teal'c, I sure wish you didn't have to.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.596
When I do...

08:40.575 --> 08:43.528
you will show me this world.

08:43.494 --> 08:45.735
Ah, you bet.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.809
Just not all at once, though.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.171
It's big.

09:00.294 --> 09:05.419
These headaches, Major, started when
you came back from your last mission?

09:05.293 --> 09:07.962
Yeah. They've been gettin' worse.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.642
Hm.

09:09.653 --> 09:13.402
Anybody else on the team
experience these symptoms?

09:13.332 --> 09:15.408
No. Why?

09:16.052 --> 09:18.591
It could be a reaction to gate travel.

09:18.573 --> 09:23.947
Look, Doc, just give me a horse pill for the
pain or something. It's a damn headache.

09:25.812 --> 09:27.889
What's this?

09:28.373 --> 09:31.408
- You didn't notice this?
- What? Notice what?

09:34.532 --> 09:36.323
Major!

09:36.331 --> 09:38.408
<i>Argh!</i>

09:38.932 --> 09:44.638
The device should be on every planet we
find. I studied the Abydos one for months.

09:44.493 --> 09:46.568
It's sort of like a... a...

09:46.571 --> 09:50.071
- Telephone.
- Telephone. I like that.

09:50.172 --> 09:54.963
In order to get back home, all you
have to do is dial Earth, which is, um...

09:56.692 --> 09:59.775
which is what
we're here to talk about, so...

10:01.250 --> 10:04.750
What is Major Kawalsky
doing in the embarkation room?

10:08.931 --> 10:13.509
Page Colonel O'Neill and General
Hammond to the embarkation room now.

10:23.609 --> 10:26.100
- Charlie?
- Major Kawalsky?

10:29.808 --> 10:31.884
Jack?

10:35.249 --> 10:37.123
What am I doin' here?

10:41.929 --> 10:44.005
Hey, we got a sick man here!

10:44.009 --> 10:46.085
Where the hell is he?

10:48.008 --> 10:52.052
- Was the doctor here before?
- I don't remember.

10:51.969 --> 10:54.673
Sorry. Dr. Nimziki
was supposed to be on call.

10:54.648 --> 10:57.566
- Dr. Warner. What's the problem?
- Headache.

10:57.528 --> 11:01.278
Little more than a headache, Doc.
He just had a blackout.

11:01.207 --> 11:02.537
Hm.

11:02.567 --> 11:06.150
We'll do an MRI right away,
see what's going on in there.

11:07.886 --> 11:09.797
Take care of him. We need him.

11:10.327 --> 11:12.403
Thank you, sir.

11:18.168 --> 11:21.370
Welcome, Teal'c.
This is Colonel Kennedy.

11:21.327 --> 11:24.198
I'm extraordinarily pleased
to meet you, sir.

11:24.167 --> 11:28.578
Colonel Kennedy's job is to gather
information, uh, knowledge,

11:28.486 --> 11:31.024
about our potential enemies.

11:31.006 --> 11:34.043
I offer my knowledge of the Goa'ulds.

11:34.006 --> 11:37.505
I offer my skills as a warrior
in defeating them.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.861
I pledge my honour
and my life to this world.

11:40.806 --> 11:42.881
Well, thank you.

11:43.605 --> 11:47.022
This is just an informal meeting, son.

11:46.966 --> 11:49.254
Take a seat.

11:49.245 --> 11:52.448
I have a lot of questions,
so if there are no objections...

11:52.407 --> 11:57.283
What can you tell us of the power source
the Goa'ulds use for weapons, ships?

11:57.965 --> 12:01.500
- Nothing.
- I see.

12:01.964 --> 12:06.424
Do you yourself have an understanding
of the physics behind the Stargate?

12:06.565 --> 12:08.806
- No.
- I see.

12:08.803 --> 12:11.474
Knowledge of Goa'uld magic is forbidden.

12:11.445 --> 12:15.193
It's not magic, Teal'c.
They just want you to think that.

12:16.205 --> 12:18.327
Permission to barge in, sir?

12:18.325 --> 12:21.528
Colonel O'Neill. I was hoping to meet you.

12:21.963 --> 12:26.756
Your mission report from Chulak
made for a most engrossing analysis.

12:26.643 --> 12:28.967
Thanks. What was your favourite part?

12:28.963 --> 12:31.965
Perhaps now is not the time, Colonel.

12:32.322 --> 12:34.611
General, you know what I went and did?

12:34.604 --> 12:38.649
I told Teal'c how we all respect
a person's rights in this country.

12:38.803 --> 12:43.299
There's nothing untoward taking place
here, Colonel. Please, join us.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.633
Thank you.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.517
- Hey, Teal'c.
- O'Neill.

12:49.363 --> 12:53.525
That's "Teal'c" with an apostrophe -
T-E-A-L'C.

12:53.442 --> 12:54.902
- Colonel...
- Yes, sir.

12:54.923 --> 12:59.585
Very well. Teal'c, what can
you tell me about the Goa'ulds?

13:00.243 --> 13:02.865
They rule by force.

13:02.841 --> 13:06.591
Their numbers were very few,
but they are growing.

13:06.522 --> 13:11.183
- How many worlds do they control?
- Many hundreds. Perhaps more.

13:11.081 --> 13:14.498
And should we expect to encounter
these Goa'ulds everywhere?

13:14.441 --> 13:16.313
<i>- It is possible.
- We?</i>

13:16.321 --> 13:20.615
But there are many more worlds
that the Goa'ulds have no use for.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.981
On those worlds people are abandoned
and left to fend for themselves.

13:24.881 --> 13:27.918
Is there a leadership
with which we could negotiate a peace?

13:27.880 --> 13:34.048
Some, like Apophis, are great kings
and rule over many worlds as their gods.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.957
But they have no need for peace.

13:37.480 --> 13:42.106
- If they could kill you, they would.
- Could they?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.167
- They have spacecraft, right?
- Yes.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.769
Without the Stargate, such a journey
would take many months, perhaps years.

13:49.681 --> 13:52.884
It would take many vessels,
many slave armies.

13:52.840 --> 13:56.209
We're not that much
of a nuisance just yet.

13:56.159 --> 14:00.620
- The slaves, where do they come from?
- There is a tale of a primitive world

14:00.519 --> 14:05.097
the Goa'uld discovered
millennia ago. The Tauri.

14:06.158 --> 14:10.202
First world where forms
of this type evolved.

14:10.119 --> 14:14.662
It is said the Goa'uld
harvested among the primitives.

14:14.558 --> 14:17.725
Some became Goa'uld hosts.

14:17.678 --> 14:20.216
Others became Jaffa.

14:20.198 --> 14:24.149
The rest were taken as slaves and
seeded among the stars to serve them.

14:24.078 --> 14:26.570
But that world has been lost for centuries.

14:26.998 --> 14:33.284
<i>Teal'c, beings of this form
evolved here, on Earth.</i>

14:38.158 --> 14:41.195
<i>- This world?
- Is the world you're talkin' about.</i>

14:41.157 --> 14:46.863
Ra came here. If our ancestors
hadn't rebelled and buried the Stargate...

14:46.716 --> 14:50.381
You would have not become
strong enough to challenge them.

14:50.317 --> 14:54.645
Then the galaxy is populated
by the ancient peoples of Earth.

14:54.557 --> 14:58.850
- There could be millions by now.
- Then you are their greatest hope.

15:00.956 --> 15:03.032
And mine.

15:23.595 --> 15:25.469
I'll drop by the control room.

15:25.475 --> 15:29.389
By the silence, it seems like
the Goa'ulds have finally given up.

15:29.315 --> 15:32.850
- When was the last time you slept?
- I don't know.

15:32.796 --> 15:35.038
Doesn't help when the base goes on alert.

15:35.033 --> 15:40.408
No, it's not that. It's that my mind races
and I can't stop thinking about Sha're,

15:40.274 --> 15:45.269
- Where she is, what she's become.
- But you can't stay awake for ever.

15:45.793 --> 15:47.917
I can try!

15:47.913 --> 15:51.080
You're right.
I'll meet you at the next briefing.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.469
All right.

16:44.191 --> 16:49.813
Major Kawalsky, we're all done here, but
I'm taking you off active duty as of now.

16:50.951 --> 16:53.027
Major?

16:54.710 --> 16:57.461
<i>Security to the infirmary.
Security to the infirmary.</i>

16:57.431 --> 17:00.301
<i>Set. Condition red. Set. Condition red.</i>

17:17.387 --> 17:20.259
Kawalsky, what the hell
are you doing? Agh!

17:21.348 --> 17:23.009
Close the blast doors!

17:23.029 --> 17:27.075
Emergency in the control room!
Emergency in the control room!

17:32.069 --> 17:34.145
<i>Help me.</i>

17:35.229 --> 17:37.103
Kawalsky!

17:44.667 --> 17:46.957
Don't shoot!

17:47.548 --> 17:49.624
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

18:01.386 --> 18:04.057
They won't let you
out of this mountain alive.

18:04.028 --> 18:07.978
When those doors open,
they'll shoot on sight. You know that.

18:21.626 --> 18:24.248
Someone in the elevator
hit the emergency stop.

18:24.226 --> 18:27.060
<i>- Get the doors open!
- Hey!</i>

18:27.027 --> 18:30.313
- Get 'em open!
- It's about time. Gimme a hand here.

18:30.266 --> 18:34.844
- Charlie, what the hell's goin' on?
- I don't have a clue, but she's hurt bad.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.035
We have to get her to the infirmary.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.369
The parasite's wrapped around his spine.

18:59.345 --> 19:02.013
It's a... it's a Goa'uld.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.845
Probably an infant.

19:04.864 --> 19:09.573
They think the reason it hasn't taken you
over completely is it's not mature yet.

19:09.464 --> 19:14.589
<i>- It's what's causing your blackouts.
- What? I got one of the parasites in me?</i>

19:15.824 --> 19:19.490
- How in the hell does that happen?
- We were hoping you could tell us.

19:19.423 --> 19:21.961
You didn't feel it happening?

19:21.943 --> 19:23.604
No.

19:23.624 --> 19:26.162
When was the first time you blacked out?

19:27.183 --> 19:29.259
I was here.

19:31.061 --> 19:33.932
We'd just come back through
from Chulak.

19:33.903 --> 19:37.486
I thought it was just from
coming back through the Stargate.

19:37.423 --> 19:40.339
We were helping that kid.
Casey was his name.

19:41.143 --> 19:44.476
It was a... a sharp...

19:45.623 --> 19:47.699
Oh, God, Jack.

19:48.822 --> 19:50.897
I thought I wrenched my neck.

19:52.702 --> 19:56.486
Anyway, Casey, he was all right.
They took him outta there.

19:59.382 --> 20:02.251
Oh, God, Jack. You gotta help me.

20:02.221 --> 20:06.549
- You gotta get this thing outta me.
- That's the plan.

20:08.381 --> 20:12.461
I've taken Major Kawalsky off all pain
medication to increase his alertness.

20:12.381 --> 20:17.008
<i>- It should increase his ability to resist...
- When can you remove it?</i>

20:16.901 --> 20:21.858
It'd be a complex operation. The parasite
is woven around his nervous system.

20:21.741 --> 20:23.948
Can it be done or not?

20:23.941 --> 20:26.561
Without killing him, possibly.

20:26.539 --> 20:29.789
Without making him a quadriplegic,
that's a different story.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.943
You just tell me who you need
to assist, anyone in the world.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.433
- I'll have them here within 24 hours.
- Yes, sir.

20:42.538 --> 20:45.457
When I was out, did I hurt anybody?

20:47.420 --> 20:50.289
There's one man dead. A few more hurt.

20:50.259 --> 20:54.506
Captain Carter's gonna be all right.
I was just gonna go check on her.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.336
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- No. She doesn't blame you.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.968
You're not responsible. It's not your fault.

20:59.939 --> 21:02.809
It's that damn thing that's inside of you.

21:02.778 --> 21:07.984
Once they know how to do it, they'll cut it
out of you. Right now you gotta fight it.

21:09.057 --> 21:12.722
I don't mind tellin' you,
this is scarin' me big time.

21:19.538 --> 21:22.160
Teal'c, stand and face this way, please.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.838
What is the emergency?
They would not tell me.

21:27.136 --> 21:32.131
- That's none of your concern now.
- Kawalsky's been infected with a Goa'uld.

21:33.096 --> 21:36.049
And you wish to see if
I still carry the Goa'uld in me?

21:36.017 --> 21:37.891
Yes. Now, please.

21:41.498 --> 21:43.574
God! I hate those things.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.423
Have you seen enough?

21:51.494 --> 21:54.615
- You understand we had to see this.
- What are its demands?

21:54.576 --> 21:59.073
So far it's only managed to rear its
ugly head whenever Kawalsky blacks out.

21:58.976 --> 22:02.641
- It's already killed a man.
- There'll be a struggle for the host body.

22:02.575 --> 22:05.196
It must have sought a host
before it was mature.

22:05.175 --> 22:07.962
We intend to remove it
before that happens.

22:07.934 --> 22:12.596
It will kill the host if you try. Once it is one
with the host, it is capable of killing him.

22:12.654 --> 22:14.315
So...

22:15.174 --> 22:17.333
What do we do?

22:20.814 --> 22:23.305
Charlie, we got General Hammond here.

22:24.454 --> 22:29.449
General, please, you gotta tell 'em
to do something. The pain is too much.

22:29.334 --> 22:34.162
- We are, Major. You just have to hold on.
- Don't give me that "good soldier" crap!

22:34.054 --> 22:36.130
Order them to cut this thing out of me!

22:36.134 --> 22:40.346
- Teal'c says if they do that you might die.
- I don't care!

22:40.252 --> 22:43.703
Look, Charlie... they wanna talk to it.

22:44.732 --> 22:47.651
What? What the hell
is there to talk about?

22:47.613 --> 22:51.825
- We must offer it life to save yours.
- No! No! I want you to kill it!

22:52.212 --> 22:55.877
<i>- We must talk to the Goa'uld.
- Jack. Please help me, Jack.</i>

22:55.814 --> 23:00.026
- Charlie, just let 'em do their job!
- Don't let them do it. I want you to kill it!

22:59.932 --> 23:07.478
- His heart rate just doubled.
- Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

23:13.012 --> 23:14.721
<i>Nemeth kree.</i>

23:14.731 --> 23:18.267
I won't speak to the traitor.
You are their leader?

23:18.211 --> 23:19.705
- I am.
- Speak.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.733
I'm General George Hammond,
United States Air Force.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.811
Commander in chief of the SGC.
And you are?

23:25.771 --> 23:28.689
Interested only in returning
through the Stargate. Now!

23:28.651 --> 23:32.482
You are in no position to make demands.
I have a proposition...

23:32.411 --> 23:34.451
Release me now, or I will destroy you.

23:34.451 --> 23:39.788
If you leave this man's body, we'll let you
live and send you back through the gate.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.523
This body is mine.

23:41.531 --> 23:45.364
If you're unwilling to leave,
we will be forced to surgically...

23:46.250 --> 23:48.491
Teal'c! Hold him!

23:48.490 --> 23:51.242
Release me now or I will destroy you!

23:51.210 --> 23:53.997
- Do not attempt to escape.
- I command you!

23:53.970 --> 23:58.097
- We'll open fire. Colonel, stand aside!
- Release me now!

23:58.289 --> 24:00.032
Take aim!

24:01.009 --> 24:02.670
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

24:02.691 --> 24:06.224
<i>- Hold your fire!
- Oh! Oh, God!</i>

24:07.289 --> 24:10.990
It's all right, son.
I won't put you through that again.

24:10.930 --> 24:13.336
Oh, Jack, what did I do?

24:13.329 --> 24:17.279
Nothin'. Just got a little mouthy.
Nothin' serious.

24:19.568 --> 24:24.810
Dr. Warner, I want to know the minute
that godforsaken thing can be taken out.

24:24.689 --> 24:26.147
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.243
This conversation is over.

24:32.327 --> 24:34.403
As you were, people.

24:37.288 --> 24:41.286
In light of the day's events, Colonel
Kennedy has made recommendations

24:41.208 --> 24:44.659
to my superiors that I want to
share with you. Colonel Kennedy?

24:44.606 --> 24:47.311
I know many of you
have served with Kawalsky,

24:47.287 --> 24:51.201
so please forgive me if what
I'm about to suggest appears callous,

24:51.127 --> 24:54.461
but I believe surgical removal
of the parasite may be a mistake.

24:54.406 --> 24:57.325
General, this is a waste of time
Kawalsky does not have.

24:57.288 --> 25:01.500
Dr. Warner, what are Major Kawalsky's
chances of surviving the procedure?

25:01.406 --> 25:03.280
10... 12%, at most.

25:03.287 --> 25:07.829
And the parasite? It is an intelligent
being, after all. Isn't it, Colonel?

25:07.726 --> 25:12.933
- I believe I first read that in your report.
- The parasite itself would not survive.

25:13.326 --> 25:17.787
So, we're faced with destroying one life
in the hopeless attempt to save another.

25:17.685 --> 25:20.176
- You see the ethical dilemma.
- No, I don't.

25:20.166 --> 25:24.663
My team and I are completely prepared to
perform the procedure. We'll do our best.

25:24.567 --> 25:27.140
Of course you will.
Please don't misunderstand.

25:27.125 --> 25:31.622
We all wish the invading parasite in
Major Kawalsky could be safely removed,

25:31.526 --> 25:33.602
but the facts are the facts.

25:33.605 --> 25:37.471
- I'm sorry. What was your point?
- If we proceed with this operation,

25:37.405 --> 25:39.564
Major Kawalsky will have died in vain.

25:39.565 --> 25:43.230
- And if we don't?
- Well, let's consider that for a moment.

25:43.165 --> 25:50.377
These infant Goa'ulds, if they're so fragile
in their larval state that they require a...

25:50.164 --> 25:53.000
- Sorry. What is it you called yourself?
- Jaffa.

25:53.443 --> 25:58.651
...for want of a better translation, what,
incubator? How is it they're so intelligent?

25:58.523 --> 26:02.307
A Goa'uld is born with the knowledge
of all Goa'ulds that came before it.

26:02.243 --> 26:06.193
- Genetic memory. That's amazing.
- Yes, it is.

26:06.124 --> 26:09.124
<i>All the knowledge of the Goa'ulds.</i>

26:10.084 --> 26:14.828
- Think on that before we throw it away.
- I've thought about it. You thought, too?

26:14.723 --> 26:17.973
- I think we've all... Any more thinking?
- Colonel...

26:17.922 --> 26:21.088
Imagine if we convince this Goa'uld
to share that knowledge.

26:21.042 --> 26:23.118
A Goa'uld would not willingly share.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.954
<i>Teal'c is right. To them, we're nothing.
Less than nothing.</i>

26:26.883 --> 26:30.962
They've taken on the roles of our
ancient gods. What does that tell you?

26:30.883 --> 26:34.750
<i>What if we just studied it?
How much could we learn from that?</i>

26:34.923 --> 26:39.134
What if we faced up to the fact of Major
Kawalsky's slim chances of survival

26:39.041 --> 26:42.576
and realised that the greatest enemy
mankind may ever face

26:42.521 --> 26:45.938
has just been delivered
right to our doorstep?

26:45.882 --> 26:49.878
Even if we let it return through
the Stargate as a gesture of good faith...

26:49.801 --> 26:53.586
- What kind of an officer are you, Colonel?
- Sir?

26:53.520 --> 26:59.855
As long as there is any chance my officer
will survive this, we'll go ahead with it.

26:59.681 --> 27:02.385
I feel I should take this to my superiors.

27:02.362 --> 27:08.898
Well, me, I'll just call the president and
get approval right from the horse's mouth!

27:08.721 --> 27:12.172
But you go right ahead, Colonel.
Talk to your superiors.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.358
In the meantime, people,
let's get the job done.

27:30.319 --> 27:34.731
Do you sense the new anaesthetic is
working better than the last one we tried?

27:34.638 --> 27:36.097
Yes.

27:36.117 --> 27:38.655
But you're not sure?

27:38.640 --> 27:43.432
There's no communication at all
between you and the symbiote?

27:43.318 --> 27:47.363
A Jaffa does not communicate
with the Goa'uld it carries.

27:47.278 --> 27:50.030
Well, keep your fingers crossed.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.827
Nurse, you can stop this IV and
release the patient. We'll go with this one.

27:58.518 --> 28:00.675
They're gettin' ready.

28:00.676 --> 28:02.752
It's about time.

28:03.318 --> 28:05.311
How's the pain?

28:05.317 --> 28:07.477
Maybe I'm just gettin' used to it.

28:09.438 --> 28:14.395
- Listen, Jack, if this doesn't work...
- Hey, come on. It's a cakewalk.

28:14.278 --> 28:17.232
It hurts to talk.
Will you shut up for a second?

28:19.116 --> 28:21.786
I wanna be cremated.

28:21.757 --> 28:26.003
I don't want there to be anything left
of that thing inside of me.

28:25.915 --> 28:29.000
- You make sure, all right?
- Can we not talk about this?

28:28.957 --> 28:34.200
When am I gonna talk about it, Jack?
This could be my last conversation.

28:34.076 --> 28:37.576
For cryin' out loud,
it's not your last conversation.

28:38.797 --> 28:42.332
Hey, I spoke to the doc.
He told me the odds.

28:42.277 --> 28:44.566
Don't give me any crap.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.343
OK, it's our last conversation.

28:47.915 --> 28:50.489
You'll be off on some other planet.

28:50.474 --> 28:53.096
Yeah. P3A-575.

28:53.076 --> 28:54.950
Whatever.

28:56.715 --> 29:00.048
This was gonna be
my first real command.

28:59.996 --> 29:03.446
- I was lookin' forward to it.
- You still can, Charlie.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.152
They got me all tied up here.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.991
Give me your hand.

29:16.875 --> 29:19.993
I want you to know,
no matter what happens,

29:21.314 --> 29:25.358
it was an honour to serve with you... sir.

29:27.515 --> 29:30.135
Listen, um...

29:30.114 --> 29:33.317
I gotta ask you something.
It's not easy for me.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.933
We're friends.

29:38.311 --> 29:40.387
If you don't make it...

29:41.913 --> 29:44.201
can I have your stereo?

29:46.673 --> 29:48.749
What?

29:51.112 --> 29:53.188
It hurts to laugh.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.469
You all right?

29:57.072 --> 29:59.563
Oh, never better.

30:12.832 --> 30:16.413
I've held back on the anaesthetic
until it can be administered

30:16.352 --> 30:20.813
to both patient
and creature simultaneously.

30:20.711 --> 30:24.375
Major Kawalsky,
we're going to begin the operation.

30:24.310 --> 30:26.553
Are you ready?

30:26.549 --> 30:28.923
I wanna say something.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.987
General Hammond, sir?

30:30.990 --> 30:33.447
I'm here, son.

30:33.430 --> 30:38.306
If this doesn't work,
I want you to give the order.

30:38.191 --> 30:40.267
I wanna wake up as me, or not at all.

30:45.230 --> 30:47.306
You have my word, son.

30:50.429 --> 30:52.505
<i>Scalpel.</i>

31:00.109 --> 31:02.352
<i>Injecting anaesthetic.</i>

31:05.910 --> 31:08.317
All right. Start the clock.

31:11.588 --> 31:13.664
I'm making the first incision.

31:20.709 --> 31:26.876
I'm separating primary ganglia attaching
the parasite to the spinal cord... now.

31:28.669 --> 31:32.001
It's coming away
more easily than I'd hoped.

31:31.949 --> 31:34.025
Must be the anaesthetic.

31:34.548 --> 31:38.166
- At least it's going well.
- That's fantastic.

31:38.107 --> 31:42.900
If we can reverse what's happened to
the major, there's still a chance for Sha're.

31:42.788 --> 31:44.246
Let's hope.

31:44.626 --> 31:49.834
The ganglia are still
constricting periodically.

31:51.106 --> 31:57.228
Obviously, there still seems to be
some sign of life in this symbiote.

31:57.067 --> 31:59.984
I don't know how. Scissors.

31:59.947 --> 32:02.022
<i>Scissors.</i>

32:05.506 --> 32:11.509
There are... thin filaments
extending up and into the brain.

32:11.506 --> 32:13.250
I'm going to sever them.

32:20.826 --> 32:22.700
Hold him still!

32:22.704 --> 32:24.780
What's happening?

32:25.944 --> 32:30.239
I don't know, sir.
I don't think it was anything I did.

32:30.144 --> 32:32.221
I'd like to proceed.

32:32.224 --> 32:34.681
- How much longer?
- Almost there.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.417
Almost...

32:42.424 --> 32:44.500
- Large clamp.
- Large clamp.

32:53.103 --> 32:55.557
I'm... taking it out...

32:57.982 --> 32:59.856
now.

33:10.742 --> 33:12.902
I think we did it!

33:14.821 --> 33:17.491
<i>- Close for me.
- Well done, everyone.</i>

33:24.021 --> 33:26.596
That's right, Dorothy. It was all a dream.

33:26.582 --> 33:28.657
Can you move your fingers?

33:31.021 --> 33:32.895
Toes?

33:32.902 --> 33:34.443
Hey!

33:34.461 --> 33:39.503
Congratulations, Major. You've already
exceeded my wildest expectations.

33:42.661 --> 33:44.737
Thirsty.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.896
Here.

33:50.540 --> 33:54.076
Easy, big fella.
You're not drinkin' for two any more.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.769
I made it.

33:57.780 --> 34:00.901
See? Told you. Piece of cake.

34:04.940 --> 34:08.724
I heard the operation was
a complete success, sir. Congratulations.

34:08.659 --> 34:12.704
- I have orders to return to Langley.
- Don't let the door hit your ass as you go.

34:12.619 --> 34:16.070
With Teal'c, sir.
I have his travel orders as well.

34:16.018 --> 34:19.518
You realise without his cooperation
in finding an anaesthetic,

34:19.460 --> 34:22.829
the operation might've failed?
We owe him something for that.

34:22.780 --> 34:26.612
But Teal'c is now carrying
the only living Goa'uld available for study.

34:26.539 --> 34:32.043
And we do need to study it. These aliens
are the greatest threat this country has...

34:31.898 --> 34:37.902
I'm well aware of the threat, Colonel.
This facility is the front line.

34:37.739 --> 34:40.489
We just go about things
differently around here.

34:40.458 --> 34:45.166
I see. Well, I'll make the transport
arrangements in the morning.

34:45.259 --> 34:47.382
You do that.

34:51.378 --> 34:56.835
Colonel Kennedy's probably gonna take it
with him, so if you wanna see it before...

34:56.697 --> 35:00.362
- You mean that thing in my head?
- Daniel thinks it's fascinating.

35:00.297 --> 35:03.630
- No, I just thought you'd wanna see it.
- No. Thanks.

35:04.737 --> 35:08.603
Hey, they're shipping Teal'c to Langley.
Kennedy's taking him with him.

35:08.536 --> 35:09.996
- What?!
- What for?

35:10.016 --> 35:11.974
Study. That's Kennedy's word.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.052
Right. Like a damn lab rat!

35:14.057 --> 35:17.094
Apparently,
Kennedy's ethics are selective.

35:22.896 --> 35:25.221
In case the colonel can't talk him out of it,

35:25.217 --> 35:28.585
I'd like a minute alone with Teal'c
before they ship him out.

35:28.536 --> 35:31.110
He helped get me through this.

35:31.097 --> 35:34.512
- I gotta thank him.
- OK. I think that can be arranged.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.478
Hey.

35:47.494 --> 35:49.072
Come on over here.

35:49.096 --> 35:52.262
I wanna shake hands with the man
who helped save my life.

36:01.135 --> 36:04.170
I'd like a minute alone with my friend.

36:06.693 --> 36:10.110
I'll make it an order.
Does that make you feel better?

36:22.972 --> 36:26.840
<i>Jaffa, what they removed
was merely a dead husk.</i>

36:26.775 --> 36:29.181
I'd already become one with the host.

36:30.052 --> 36:32.128
I give you this chance.

36:32.134 --> 36:34.505
Serve me and you may live.

36:35.813 --> 36:38.434
I... will... not.

36:39.773 --> 36:41.849
Then die!

36:55.572 --> 36:57.231
I'm doing all I can.

36:57.251 --> 37:01.581
So, because he wasn't born on this
planet, he doesn't have rights any more?

37:03.652 --> 37:05.728
Get out!

37:07.130 --> 37:08.588
Major!

37:08.612 --> 37:10.485
Argh!

37:25.528 --> 37:26.358
What happened?

37:30.369 --> 37:33.454
The Goa'uld has won.
It's taken control of him.

37:33.411 --> 37:35.902
- But how?
- It deceived us.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.693
<i>Jaffa... kal sha!</i>

38:00.809 --> 38:02.268
You cannot pass.

38:04.170 --> 38:06.458
- What?
- He set the coordinates for Chulak!

38:14.927 --> 38:18.463
- He set the autodestruct sequence.
- How'd he have the code?

38:18.407 --> 38:21.907
I don't know, but I need two officers
to override, and you're it!

38:38.286 --> 38:40.278
That did it. Open the blast doors.

38:45.847 --> 38:48.764
Teal'c! Hold him there!

38:51.485 --> 38:54.356
Shut it down!

38:54.327 --> 38:55.786
Now!

39:31.164 --> 39:33.239
He was your friend.

39:34.684 --> 39:36.760
My friend died on the table.

39:55.443 --> 40:00.817
The fact that he set the autodestruct code
shows there's hope for Sha're and Skaara.

40:00.684 --> 40:03.969
- How?
- Because only Kawalsky knew that code.

40:04.164 --> 40:06.998
So something of the host must survive.

40:11.483 --> 40:14.188
Oh, absolutely. That's good to hear.

40:15.440 --> 40:19.568
Oh, any time, sir. You just come on down.
We'd be glad to have you.

40:20.121 --> 40:23.871
Well, hell, sir. He's right here.
Why don't you tell him yourself?

40:23.800 --> 40:26.291
I'm sure he'd like to hear it from you.

40:27.521 --> 40:29.597
Yes, Mr. President.

40:31.043 --> 40:32.074
Yes, sir.

40:32.121 --> 40:35.288
- Colonel O'Neill, is SG-1 ready to go?
- We are, sir.

40:35.242 --> 40:38.657
Then you have a go
for a standard recon mission on P3-575.

40:38.599 --> 40:40.675
Yes, sir.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.498
Reporting as ordered.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.184
<i>"Sir." "Sir."</i>

40:48.161 --> 40:50.449
- Sir.
- Welcome aboard, son.

40:52.641 --> 40:57.054
<i>The MALP reports
conditions on the planet are favourable.</i>

41:01.400 --> 41:03.476
Well?
