01:02.596 --> 01:07.885
<i>In the public eye and in the underworld,
John Gotti has taken on mythic proportion.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:10.204
<i>Gotti is kind of a working class hero.</i>

01:10.604 --> 01:15.409
<i>Gotti, the reputed head of the nation's
largest mafia family, the Gambinos,</i>

01:15.509 --> 01:18.645
<i>has beaten prosecutors
in the last three cases.</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:21.014
For the government,
this is a must-win case.

01:21.114 --> 01:24.518
They've said it before, but this time
the feds say they've really got the goods

01:24.618 --> 01:27.221
to lock the reputed godfather
away for life.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.882
I think we can end
the mafia as an institution

01:30.982 --> 01:35.230
in the next 3 or 4 years, 5 years,
by keeping this kind of pressure on them.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.401
Every day on my WABC radio program,

01:40.501 --> 01:42.670
I will continue to hammer away

01:42.770 --> 01:45.839
at the revisionism
that is the Gotti legacy.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.710
In New York, the Gotti trial
is the hottest show off Broadway.

01:49.810 --> 01:53.764
Every day at the courthouse,
the Dapper Don plays to a sellout crowd.

01:53.864 --> 01:57.238
It's not just average guys
caught up in the Gotti spectacle.

01:57.338 --> 02:01.088
A who's who from Hollywood
came to Brooklyn to take in the show.

02:01.188 --> 02:06.327
The decision by Sammy Gravano
to testify is certainly a big, big event.

02:06.427 --> 02:10.931
<i>Gotti's brother Peter indicated the
affections between the two men have faded.</i>

02:11.031 --> 02:14.823
- You ready to see Sam Gravano today?
- You ready yet, sir?

02:21.823 --> 02:23.653
Your Honor...

02:24.269 --> 02:27.042
the state would like
to postpone until tomorrow.

02:27.142 --> 02:30.884
The state's witness, Sam Gravano,
was unable to appear due to illness.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.887
Postponed until tomorrow morning.
Let's not make this a habit.

02:33.987 --> 02:40.361
Also, Mr. Gotti, if you have any idea who's
behind putting these in car windshields,

02:40.661 --> 02:43.686
kindly ask them to stop.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.602
Court is dismissed.

03:33.612 --> 03:36.250
<i>If I want anything done, I do it myself.</i>

03:36.550 --> 03:39.926
<i>Yeah, you always was a fair guy, Eddie.</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:45.459
<i>Eddie! Crazy! Eddie.</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:48.517
- <i>This is one rap you won't beat.</i>
- <i>Crazy!</i>

03:51.298 --> 03:54.893
<i>You like to laugh, do you? Well, here,
see if you think this is funny.</i>

04:00.206 --> 04:02.031
<i>Eddie!</i>

04:06.478 --> 04:08.428
<i>Eddie!</i>

04:10.649 --> 04:14.573
<i>Now, who is this guy?
And how are you hooked up with him?</i>

04:17.990 --> 04:20.286
<i>I never figured it out.</i>

04:20.387 --> 04:22.685
<i>What was his business?</i>

04:24.564 --> 04:28.024
Hey, John, how are you?

04:28.124 --> 04:30.759
<i>He used to be a big shot.</i>

04:43.783 --> 04:45.782
I'm ready.

04:56.964 --> 05:00.322
- Let's go, man.
- Yeah, I see you.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.394
<i>Mierta.</i> You had me waiting
for like 20 minutes, man.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.809
John Gotti's a hero in Queens.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.112
Forget Queens, all over New York,
all over the country.

05:12.212 --> 05:16.583
The city denied the club a fireworks
permit for the first time this year,

05:16.683 --> 05:19.206
but that hasn't seemed to stop
the celebrations one bit.

05:19.306 --> 05:22.279
Neighbors say that Mayor Dinkins
is doing this as an attack

05:22.379 --> 05:25.292
on Ozone Park's favorite citizen,
John Gotti.

05:26.192 --> 05:31.287
This is Pablo Guzman in Queens.
News channel 10, back to you.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.271
Pablo.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.193
Don't write the history books yet.

06:19.979 --> 06:23.338
All right, everybody, this one's for John!

06:51.911 --> 06:53.128
John!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.899
Could you light this for me, please?

07:42.227 --> 07:44.520
Give me that.

07:51.653 --> 07:53.446
You're so rude.

08:05.951 --> 08:09.127
Who's he? The ice cream man?

08:09.928 --> 08:12.147
Shut up, Ann.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.810
Yeah, you in the communion suit.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.371
You been here all day, and nobody
knows you. What are you looking for?

08:36.515 --> 08:39.019
- Where are you from?
- I'm from the Bronx.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.332
- The Bronx? Then what are you doing here?
- I'm celebrating.

08:43.433 --> 08:46.530
You're celebrating? You're celebrating?
No, no, this is a private block party.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.762
I was invited by Junior.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.965
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you saying you're with Junior?

08:52.665 --> 08:56.509
- Am I stuttering? Are you with Junior?
- Hey, hey, he's with me, Jerry. He's with me.

08:56.609 --> 08:58.928
- What do you mean?
- Here.

08:59.028 --> 09:02.864
You got a problem with my friend, you go
in the Hunt club. You tell him he's with me.

09:04.476 --> 09:07.369
- Move it.
- Yeah, I'll move it, I'll move it.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.041
So, what, you're just gonna
stare at me all night?

09:17.256 --> 09:21.428
- You wanna split this?
- You're skinny, you gotta eat that.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.365
What's your name?

09:25.365 --> 09:27.167
Thomas.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.736
Thomas.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.052
What's yours?

09:46.452 --> 09:49.056
Easy, easy, speed racer.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.980
Not so fast.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.445
- You're gonna make me come.
- I'm gonna come.

09:55.545 --> 09:59.872
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Come on.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.670
- You feel good.
- Come on.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.264
Don't... don't come out. Stay.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.902
Yeah, stay like that. Stay inside.

10:20.135 --> 10:22.272
Kiss me.

10:23.722 --> 10:26.048
You're beautiful.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.085
You're fuckin' beautiful.

10:37.402 --> 10:40.006
- It's safe.
- Quiet.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.031
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on, hold on.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.079
You feel that?

10:49.215 --> 10:52.358
- What?
- It's like it vibrates in here.

10:55.754 --> 10:59.324
- You Italian?
- Half. My mother's side.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.094
- Here.
- My father's Irish.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.319
That's a deadly combination.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.041
Thomas Lucaze.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.167
We called him Three-finger Brown.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.879
Could have been a pro ball player.
A bunch of wiseguys buried him.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.641
- Al Capone here, too?
- No.

11:21.741 --> 11:24.985
Mount Carmel Cemetery, Illinois,
'cause of his years in Chicago.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.253
Do you know he's from Brooklyn?

11:27.353 --> 11:31.658
He got married there, too,
to an Irish woman, Mae Coughlin.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.761
It's funny, it's like your family,
but the other way around.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.553
How do you know all this crazy stuff?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.498
Nice.

11:53.512 --> 11:58.185
- Why, you wanna know?
- No. It won't come true.

11:59.585 --> 12:02.253
You wanna come home with me?

12:02.353 --> 12:05.192
- Yeah.
- Stay the night?

12:05.692 --> 12:07.250
Yeah.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.668
- Well, there goes your theory.
- Yeah?

12:15.768 --> 12:18.371
- You don't know what you're in for.
- Yeah, I can handle it.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.341
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Come here.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.765
Got me excited now.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.667
Hey. Shit. Hey.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.174
You scared the shit out of me.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.609
- I got an appointment at...
- Okay.

13:29.709 --> 13:32.445
You seen my shoe?
Do you remember where I parked?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.582
No, I didn't want you to go.
I thought that...

13:35.682 --> 13:38.640
That I'd bring us back in some breakfast.

13:39.218 --> 13:43.323
- You got coffee?
- Yeah. No.

13:43.773 --> 13:47.677
That was a lie. I don't have coffee.
But I can go around the corner and get it.

13:47.777 --> 13:49.153
What is this?

13:49.253 --> 13:53.700
Like I told you last night, I'm working
on some things that might help out John Sr.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.158
Who's "The Twin"?

13:58.637 --> 14:02.775
I can't say right now.
But I got some things in the works.

14:03.275 --> 14:07.313
- "It's my family, Kay. It's not me."
- My name is Rose.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.805
"The Godfather."

14:10.650 --> 14:12.307
Michael...

14:13.720 --> 14:18.292
Your eyes look like sunflowers
in the light.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.396
You know what would be nice?
Why don't you come with me?

14:23.496 --> 14:24.731
- What?
- Come with me.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.332
Where? I gotta go to work.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.969
- Call in sick.
- I can't.

14:29.069 --> 14:33.693
Come on, come with me. I'm telling you,
you're gonna love this. Can I kiss you?

14:37.608 --> 14:39.778
You better come.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.482
What are we doing?
Is he The Twin from the photo?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.710
Come on, you'll see.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.388
Watch this, ready?
It's gonna be like a Swiss watch.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.324
One, two, three.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.695
There's nothing to it.

14:56.258 --> 14:59.331
Come on. Come on, come on.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.935
Excuse us. Sorry. Good morning.

15:03.035 --> 15:07.140
What was that? Who is he?
Is he the guy from the photo?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.098
Come on, you'll see in a moment. Come on.

15:11.676 --> 15:13.112
What? Wait.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.297
- Thomas. How are you? Good.
- Hi, Christine. Be right up there.

15:16.397 --> 15:18.351
You're gonna love this.
You gonna leave me at the steps?

15:18.451 --> 15:22.774
Come on, it's history in the making.
Come on. Come on.

15:26.591 --> 15:28.795
Thank you, Christine.

15:28.895 --> 15:32.721
She's a great artist.
I got one of her pieces.

15:33.965 --> 15:37.603
This fuckin' place gives me the creeps.
What are you up to?

15:37.703 --> 15:40.840
- You'll get used to it. Come on.
- I hope not.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.443
I didn't have good luck
last time I was in a courthouse.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.305
And to quote prosecutor Malone...

15:46.405 --> 15:49.249
"after reviewing the tape recordings
from the Ravenite social club,

15:49.349 --> 15:53.119
"it is clear that Mr. Cutler
and his associates are house counsel

15:53.219 --> 15:55.921
to the Gambino crime family."

15:56.319 --> 15:58.479
You see The Twin?

15:59.891 --> 16:02.262
Now look at the guy on the jury.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.665
Second guy in.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.689
You see?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.992
They're brothers.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.540
Look.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.409
Look.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.913
They make eyes at each other.

16:20.013 --> 16:24.016
- I'm not sure.
- What? Rose...

16:24.116 --> 16:27.486
It's right under their fuckin' nose.

16:27.586 --> 16:31.508
- Look at him, come on.
- I don't see it.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.063
I quote John Gotti from the tapes.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.066
"Where does it end?
The Gambino crime family?

16:40.166 --> 16:44.003
"This is the Cutler, Shargel,
and who-do-you-call-it crime family."

16:44.103 --> 16:46.907
I'm disqualifying Mr. Cutler
and Mr. Shargel from defending Mr....

16:47.007 --> 16:51.338
This is an obstruction of justice.
Those tapes are attorney-client privilege.

16:51.438 --> 16:54.180
May I remind you that's an American flag,
not a swastika!

16:54.280 --> 16:56.051
Yes!

16:57.684 --> 17:02.155
One more reaction like that, and you
will be removed from this courtroom!

17:02.355 --> 17:06.867
You're basically taking away
Mr. Gotti's God-given right to exist.

17:06.968 --> 17:10.646
I would suggest that you save
the histrionics for the TV reporters

17:10.747 --> 17:14.429
outside of this courtroom! Dismissed!

17:17.868 --> 17:19.894
Maybe.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.531
Look.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.178
So you get Gotti off. What then?

17:26.278 --> 17:29.615
We make history. We're in.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.351
"We"? Me and you?

17:32.451 --> 17:35.187
Yeah, me and you. What do you think?

17:35.287 --> 17:37.253
You're crazy.

18:13.659 --> 18:15.430
You can dance!

18:15.530 --> 18:18.565
All the black girls in high school
loved me. It's my butt.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.000
I got a big old butt,
and I know how to move.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.303
You know what you nearly did?
You wore me out.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.140
Listen... I gotta get going, all right?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.224
- No, come on, let's kill this.
- All right.

18:29.324 --> 18:32.312
- We gotta do a toast.
- You know what?

18:32.412 --> 18:36.782
If Gotti got off,
that would be one hell of an ending.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.986
- Right?
- I don't think that's gonna happen.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.654
Is that a little inside info?

18:43.133 --> 18:44.824
Maybe.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.792
Do you guys still talk?

18:46.892 --> 18:50.196
You know, we're not supposed to,
but... I get bits and pieces.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.767
You know what? Why don't you talk to him?
Maybe he can help us.

18:56.167 --> 18:59.005
- Maybe.
- How much?

19:00.205 --> 19:02.041
50k.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.277
50k, we get "not guilty"?

19:04.577 --> 19:07.035
I'll talk to my brother.

19:09.247 --> 19:10.683
We'll talk to our people.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.554
You know, John Gotti, he's being persecuted
by the United States government.

19:14.654 --> 19:19.359
The same government that stole the land
from the Indians and enslaved your people.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.994
I'm Jamaican.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.123
Well, you're soon to be a rich Jamaican.
It was nice meeting you.

19:25.223 --> 19:28.256
Nice to meet you, too. Take care.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.538
- I'm right.
- Oh, my God.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.624
- Am I right?
- My God!

19:35.724 --> 19:38.082
You're an angel!

20:02.667 --> 20:05.204
It's closing time.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.809
Hey, Timmy, wanna give these two
a few dollars for a motel, man?

20:09.909 --> 20:13.579
What'd you say? Motel? This is my wife.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.649
- Okay.
- You apologize to Mrs. Greco.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.319
- Come on, Thomas...
- No, I want an apology for Mrs. Greco.

20:20.419 --> 20:24.211
Listen to your woman.
Get the fuck out of here, asshole.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.516
- What?
- You heard me.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.955
- You call him an asshole?
- Hey, yo!

20:34.732 --> 20:38.237
- My husband's waiting for an apology.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.273
- Is that okay, honey?
- He said sorry.

20:41.373 --> 20:45.278
- Go, go, go, go. Go.
- He said s... slowly.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.302
Go!

21:00.391 --> 21:01.483
Hey!

21:11.803 --> 21:13.861
You okay?

21:17.842 --> 21:20.590
I'm sorry. That was crazy.

21:22.647 --> 21:26.107
Sometimes I do crazy things.
I don't know why.

21:30.155 --> 21:34.031
Okay, I get it. Get out! Get the fuck out!

21:34.131 --> 21:38.230
- No, that was incredible. That was amazing.
- Yes! Get the fuck out!

21:38.330 --> 21:41.834
Rose... Rose, stop. Look at me.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.420
- No.
- Look at me, that was amazing.

21:44.520 --> 21:48.508
I'm sorry I was quiet. I'm sorry,
I wasn't even... I wasn't even thinking.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.578
I should have done something.
I think I was just really embarrassed.

21:53.819 --> 21:56.037
Come close.

22:00.284 --> 22:02.243
I'm sorry.

22:29.914 --> 22:31.984
You coming back?

22:32.084 --> 22:34.609
Course I'm coming back.

22:38.590 --> 22:42.462
32, 33, 34, 35, and 40.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.131
Thank you, Donna.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.221
That's for you.

22:47.999 --> 22:51.521
Donna, please tell Jimmy
we miss him a lot and... you...

22:52.671 --> 22:56.102
If I ever make it to Phoenix,
although I doubt I ever will,

22:56.202 --> 22:58.857
I will get in touch. Thank you.

23:04.482 --> 23:07.066
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:07.686 --> 23:11.491
- The shop looks good.
- Same old shit.

23:11.691 --> 23:16.752
You believe this weather? It's hot,
it's cold, it's hot. Cold again.

23:20.765 --> 23:24.803
- Joey Bagels?
- How'd you guess?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.972
Holy shit.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.708
- Yeah.
- So young.

23:29.808 --> 23:35.836
- What happened, someone punch his ticket?
- Yeah, God. Clogged arteries.

23:38.249 --> 23:40.603
Well, look, Ally, I appreciate
you helping with this.

23:40.853 --> 23:44.170
It's just 'til this business deal
goes through, all right?

23:44.270 --> 23:48.961
After you called,
I spoke to Ann about this, okay?

23:49.061 --> 23:52.932
Ally, they just need to see I got a job,
and then I'll get out of your hair.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.867
I can't put you on the books, okay?

23:55.967 --> 23:59.004
She doesn't think it's a good idea
to lie to your parole officer.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.706
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.775
- And I don't either.
- All right.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.945
What if they come in here, they start
asking questions, they start...

24:06.045 --> 24:10.416
- Nobody's gonna ask any questions.
- How do you know what they're gonna do?

24:10.816 --> 24:14.871
- So you're not gonna help me with this?
- No. Can I help you, ma'am?

24:14.971 --> 24:17.590
I didn't mean to interrupt.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.960
This is Rose. She's from Queens.
It's my girlfriend.

24:22.537 --> 24:25.330
- Okay.
- This is my brother Alfonse.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.283
Hello.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.002
I just wanted to see the inside.
It's so cute.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.972
- Well...
- We should go.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.941
You know, Thomas told me a lot about you.

24:36.041 --> 24:39.745
You should come out and visit our place
with the family when we're settled in.

24:40.045 --> 24:43.336
- I didn't know you guys were...
- Yeah, no.

24:43.436 --> 24:46.085
We're in Ozone Park now, and...

24:47.174 --> 24:50.862
We were keeping it quiet for a little bit,
but, yeah, we got a big backyard,

24:51.062 --> 24:53.546
the grass, everything.
You, Ann and the boys have to come out.

24:53.646 --> 24:55.861
Be nice... get everybody together.

24:55.961 --> 24:58.631
- Sounds good.
- Well, it was nice meeting you.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.100
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, come here.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.536
You know what? Do me a favor.
I wanna show her out back, all right?

25:04.636 --> 25:07.773
- You got the keys?
- Okay.

25:08.273 --> 25:11.123
You gotta... you gotta see this.

25:12.311 --> 25:15.615
Thank you. After you.

25:16.415 --> 25:20.319
In the '60s and '70s,
this was the busiest florist in the Bronx.

25:20.419 --> 25:22.844
Probably the whole city.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.628
- The ivy.
- I'll get you a job.

25:29.428 --> 25:32.086
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:32.597 --> 25:36.402
<i>You're listening to AM 77.
This is "The Curtis Sliwa Show."</i>

25:36.502 --> 25:41.473

25:44.310 --> 25:45.845
Good morning.

25:45.945 --> 25:50.216
Do you hear this? This guy,
Gotti's gonna whack this guy.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.893
There's not even a question in my mind,
he's gonna get whacked.

25:52.993 --> 25:55.587
- You're testy. Why are you listening to that?
- I don't know.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.316
- How's it going?
- <i>John Gotti is going to spend the...</i>

25:58.416 --> 26:02.628
It's going. It's going.
All these people owe money?

26:02.728 --> 26:05.664
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of broken thumbs.

26:05.764 --> 26:09.744
These people will be better off
getting their thumbs broken.

26:09.844 --> 26:11.764
- The tile fell. The water's coming down.
- What?

26:11.864 --> 26:13.464
What time did the plumber
say he was gonna be here?

26:13.606 --> 26:15.922
He was supposed to be here.
I am gonna break some balls.

26:16.022 --> 26:18.878
He said he tried to call,
and nobody answered the phone.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.880
How's everything working out?
You finding everything okay?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.115
- Smooth.
- Good? All right.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.384
Rose, don't tell me I'm gonna
lose you upstairs now?

26:25.484 --> 26:27.887
- Hey, Arthur, I love my job.
- Okay, duchess.

26:27.987 --> 26:32.624
- I'm taking care of you. Good day.
- Okay, duchess. Duchess of...

26:33.124 --> 26:36.662
- That's Rosie, queen of Corona.
- Duchess of queen of Corona.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.431
- That's good.
- We got Julio down by the schoolyard.

26:39.531 --> 26:42.368
I'm happy that I was able
to help you with your parole.

26:42.468 --> 26:46.416
- Rose is a good friend.
- I know. I appreciate it.

26:46.516 --> 26:48.841
Well, that's good.
See, that's important because...

26:48.941 --> 26:51.744
you know, when you reintegrate
back into the real world,

26:51.844 --> 26:56.682
it's important to have appreciation
for what you got. Right?

26:57.382 --> 26:59.151
Yeah.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.921
- Did you get a smock?
- A what?

27:02.021 --> 27:04.484
Smock. Where's your smock?

27:04.584 --> 27:06.542
- The...
- Yeah, where's your smock?

27:06.642 --> 27:09.117
Here. The apron. It's up here.

27:09.217 --> 27:12.431
- Good. Okay, but you gotta wear it.
- Wear it now?

27:12.531 --> 27:14.834
You gotta wear it all the time.
You take it off when you go to lunch.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.802
I thought I was just
doing files, it wasn't...

27:17.002 --> 27:21.241
Nah, but when you're in the warehouse,
you wear the smock. Okay?

27:22.241 --> 27:25.761
Everybody wears a smock.
Tie it up, tie it up.

27:25.861 --> 27:29.014
You can't walk around like that.
You gotta tie it up.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.250
Let it do its job for you.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.586
You don't wanna get your...
your shirt messed up.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.321
If you need anything, Julio.

27:36.521 --> 27:40.359
- Julio. In the schoolyard.
- He knows everything.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.578
- I'll see you later.
- Thank you, Arthur.

27:42.678 --> 27:44.603
- Keep up the good work.
- Yeah.

28:51.707 --> 28:54.315

All right, all right, well, tonight I got
a meeting with my guys on the money.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.528
Okay.

29:05.209 --> 29:07.434
You just make sure...

29:10.247 --> 29:12.057
Just make...

29:12.157 --> 29:15.243
- Make sure you're giving him... Come on.
- Wait, what? Wait.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.251
- Just make sure you give me mine, all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

29:20.351 --> 29:23.514
- Half now, the other half when John walks.
- Half now?

29:23.614 --> 29:26.698
Yeah. No, no, no, not right now.
I'm talking about after the meeting.

29:26.798 --> 29:29.039
- Okay.
- Hey.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.711
- Get the fuck out of here.
- What's the problem?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.581
Take a walk. You know my father,
he don't want you 100 feet near here.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.984
- I wanna get a cup of coffee.
- No, you're out! That's it. I'm telling you!

30:19.084 --> 30:21.954
Make him get the fuck outta here!
He's a fuckin' whack job!

30:22.054 --> 30:25.090
- Take him for a walk, please!
- Hey, I got it. Don't worry, go back.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.692
Motherfucker.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.894
- What's the problem?
- Come on, let's go for a walk.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.904
- All right, all right, I get it, no worries.
- Get outta here!

30:32.004 --> 30:34.600
- I got it. Don't worry about it.
- It's all good.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.871
What're you doing? You know you're not
supposed to be around the clubs. You know that.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.574
Come on, I'm back now, Mickey, all right?
I didn't name names. I did the right thing.

30:42.674 --> 30:47.045
What names? No one told you to go rob
the blockbuster. You were on your own.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.781
Come on, I was just trying to be
a good soldier for Big Sal and Ern.

30:49.881 --> 30:52.484
Hey, Thomas... You're not with us, okay?

30:52.584 --> 30:55.854
You freak out Big Sal. You need to
cool it down, or you're gonna get hurt.

30:55.954 --> 30:59.558
All right, do me a favor, all right? You talk
to Big Sal, you tell him I understand

30:59.658 --> 31:03.055
there's a little bit of heat on me
right now, and it doesn't look good. Okay?

31:03.155 --> 31:06.532
- But I'm right and I'm loyal.
- You gotta stop talking like that.

31:06.632 --> 31:11.069
You're a fuckin' florist.
Now go help Alfonse and cut this shit out.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.472
Come on, Mickey, I got something big.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.408
- Mickey, I got a fuckin' juror.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

31:17.508 --> 31:20.846
What do you mean? I got a fuckin' juror
on the Gotti trial. I got his twin brother.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.368
I need to talk to John.

31:25.266 --> 31:28.687
You are crazy. No, 'cause John
ain't gonna sit down with you on this.

31:28.787 --> 31:32.290
He's not gonna sit down?
Well, then he doesn't get the juror.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.494
- You fucking with me?
- I swear to God, may he strike me dead.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.298
- On my life. I'm dead serious.
- They ain't selling you no junk, you understand?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.867
- You think this is about junk? I'm clean.
- Why don't you fuckin' tell me?

31:41.967 --> 31:45.070
Mickey, I'm clean, I'm telling you.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.193
- All right, I'll see what I can do.
- Yeah?

31:47.293 --> 31:50.242
- Then I get to meet John?
- Yeah. Let me figure everything out.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.768
I'll call you. Go home. Good-bye.

31:56.097 --> 32:00.441
- Cacciatore is nice, Mom.
- I made it because you like it.

32:00.952 --> 32:06.514
- Anthony, you want some more?
- No, Mom, I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

32:11.528 --> 32:13.965
Mr. Avello making you
a good deal on the apartment?

32:14.065 --> 32:15.887
Yeah.

32:16.649 --> 32:20.205
It's okay. I mean, it's a little moldy.
We're fixing it up as we go along.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.307
- That takes time.
- Ma, you should come see it.

32:22.407 --> 32:26.733
Come meet Thomas. You'll like him.
It'll be nice.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.668
What?

32:31.681 --> 32:33.552
Yeah. Maybe.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.555
Ma, what are you looking at him for?
It's my house.

32:36.655 --> 32:40.159
She doesn't wanna meet him.
She knows all she needs to know about him.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.828
- How?
- How do you think?

32:42.928 --> 32:45.647
Did you run my name at that little
computer of yours at work lately?

32:45.747 --> 32:48.233
It's not a pretty picture, either!

32:48.833 --> 32:51.250
- What are you doing?
- Rose, sit down. Rose, please, sit...

32:51.350 --> 32:54.773
- You didn't finish your...
- He's a kid, Rose. He's a kid.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.781
- Get a life, Anthony!
- Rose, don't start, please.

32:57.881 --> 32:59.912
- I love you.
- Sit and finish.

33:00.012 --> 33:03.014
See my place? I'll come pick you up.

33:03.114 --> 33:06.729
- Mind your own business, Anthony!
- You are my business!

33:06.829 --> 33:09.755
Daddy is rolling over in his grave
'cause of what you did.

33:10.055 --> 33:13.291
What I did? What I did?

33:13.391 --> 33:15.360
Hey. Hey.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.196
- What?
- You using again?

33:17.496 --> 33:21.266
Ma, he's got his hand on me! I got a job,
I got a boyfriend, I got an apartment.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.602
- You're using again.
- Do I look like I'm using again?

33:23.702 --> 33:27.205
- I know it! I know you.
- Get your hand out of my face!

33:27.305 --> 33:28.930
And I know him!

33:55.066 --> 33:57.069
I don't want any trouble.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.971
Well...

33:59.271 --> 34:01.628
You can have my coffee.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.614
You lost your way?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.773
I think I may have something
that interests you.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.833
We've always known that, Rose.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.360
It's not like that.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.362
I have a boyfriend now.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.620
Congratulations.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.056
It's about your friend.

34:34.907 --> 34:38.297
Let's go outside.
Let's go talk. Not in here.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.304
Come on.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.862
So how do you know this Richie guy?

34:57.962 --> 35:02.233
Hey, hey, hey, you know what?
You know what? I don't even care.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.359
You're the real deal.

35:09.538 --> 35:14.579
- There he is. My favorite twin.
- Cous. Come here.

35:14.679 --> 35:18.316
Hey, do me a favor? We gotta talk
a little business over here. Maybe...

35:18.416 --> 35:20.489
Hey. So what's the word?

35:20.589 --> 35:22.041
- Yeah, my brother's ready.
- What?

35:22.141 --> 35:23.955
- My brother's ready.
- Your brother's ready?

35:24.055 --> 35:26.358
He's ready, so, you know,
when I get mine, it's all set.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.557
We're all set?

35:27.657 --> 35:31.629
But we gotta wrap it up because... gotta
move, 'cause the trial is gonna wrap up...

35:31.729 --> 35:34.600
No, no, you don't understand.
We don't gotta move no more, you know why?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.421
We got the clearance from the tippy top.

35:37.521 --> 35:39.939
We're all good, cous.

35:40.039 --> 35:42.891
- That's gonna come in handy, I tell you.
- Well, that's your business.

35:42.991 --> 35:45.835
Now let me tell you something.
Tomorrow, we're gonna call you

35:45.935 --> 35:48.047
- in the morning, okay?
- All right.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.065
And we're gonna tell you
where we're gonna meet.

35:50.165 --> 35:52.885
- How do I say it in Jamaican? Tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

35:53.085 --> 35:55.970
- Hey, why don't you stay for a drink?
- No, no, that's all right.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.088
- Nah?
- No.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.691
- All right.
- Not my kind of place.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.732
What's that mean?
It's not your kind of place.

36:02.832 --> 36:06.320
- I don't know, it was...
- This is not my kind of place, "mahn."

36:06.931 --> 36:09.088
This my kind of place. You...

36:09.188 --> 36:12.343
Shit. Don't look. Don't look behind me.

36:12.443 --> 36:16.379
It's Paulie. It's Paulie from the fuckin'
"Pope of Greenwich Village." Look!

36:16.479 --> 36:18.941
It's fuckin' Eric Roberts.

36:21.356 --> 36:23.637
Holy shit.

36:27.151 --> 36:30.038
He's fuckin' standin' right there.
Maybe should we buy him a drink?

36:30.138 --> 36:32.982
- Yeah.
- Come on. Paulie...

36:33.892 --> 36:35.882
To the end of the bed bug.

36:38.595 --> 36:41.855
- Yeah, that's good.
- Holy shit.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.604
Disco, Paulie.

36:46.804 --> 36:49.807
Paulie, anything you need,
you talk to me, all right?

36:49.907 --> 36:52.889
Eric. You gotta start
calling me Eric, man.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.281
You know, it was nice to see
Charlie at John's trial.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.584
It was good to see him show support.
It was solid.

36:59.684 --> 37:02.487
Charlie? You mean Mickey, Mickey Rourke.

37:02.587 --> 37:07.259
You heard it here.
Uncle John walks. Mark my words.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.628
Hey, you need anything,
name's Thomas, all right?

37:09.728 --> 37:14.065
Thanks, Thomas, I really appreciate
the cocaine and the conversation.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.936
Hey, you know, I was glad you poisoned
the bed bug's espresso.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.122
You should've never ratted on your
buddy Charlie, but you know what?

37:21.222 --> 37:23.274
You came through in the end.

37:23.374 --> 37:26.577
Well... the movie, right?

37:26.777 --> 37:29.704
I'm glad you liked it. Thanks, brother.

37:36.821 --> 37:39.157
- His nose is like a fuckin' vacuum.
- Really?

37:39.257 --> 37:44.040
It was just... forget it, he was snorting
everything up. You kidding me?

37:44.140 --> 37:47.699
- I wanna go to Hawaii.
- Are you kidding me?

37:47.799 --> 37:51.670
You know how many fuckin' big shots are in
here? They're called Hawaiian moonlighters.

37:51.770 --> 37:56.041
They're in there, playing cards,
probably 30, 40 grand on the table.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.688
You wanna moonlight in Hawaii with me?

38:01.146 --> 38:03.604
Let me take you to Hawaii.

38:06.516 --> 38:09.988
Tomorrow, we're gonna be able
to walk into that place...

38:10.088 --> 38:13.992
we're gonna lay down 30 grand
of our own money on the table.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.395
Like a king and a queen. You know that?

38:16.995 --> 38:19.471
What's the matter with you?

38:26.036 --> 38:29.341
- Promise me something.
- What?

38:30.641 --> 38:34.680
- Promise you what?
- That I'm never going back to jail.

38:35.480 --> 38:40.285
- Rose, I promise you.
- You better fuckin' be for real, Thomas.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.288
Rose... come here, give me your hand.

38:44.272 --> 38:46.925
I promise. All right?

38:49.279 --> 38:51.129
Come on.

38:51.229 --> 38:55.189
We got a big day tomorrow.
Come on. Let's go home.

39:09.247 --> 39:12.306
- I look all right?
- Yeah.

39:18.788 --> 39:21.515
He said he'd meet us outside.

39:30.934 --> 39:33.938
Or should I... Maybe I'll just go inside?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.617
What are you doing? No?

39:39.509 --> 39:41.936
Richie, this is Thomas.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.152
- This is Rose.
- Yeah, I know Rose.

39:47.752 --> 39:50.644
I don't wanna talk in here. Come.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.425
- I thought... we're not gonna...
- Nah, it's okay.

39:54.525 --> 39:57.728
Talk down there, you talk to him
by yourself, you know?

39:59.263 --> 40:01.466
I thought The Twin was coming with you.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.668
Yeah, no, no.
He was supposed to meet us outside,

40:03.768 --> 40:06.171
and then I figured
I was gonna check inside.

40:06.271 --> 40:10.497
'Cause, you know, if you're not on
the inside, you're on the outside, right?

40:12.008 --> 40:14.112
When do I get to meet John?

40:14.212 --> 40:16.636
He's not coming, Thomas.

40:17.714 --> 40:20.518
No, no, I know he's not...

40:20.618 --> 40:22.854
I know he's not gonna be here
right now, but I'm saying...

40:22.954 --> 40:26.357
Not Gotti. I meant your twin.

40:26.457 --> 40:30.732
I don't wanna see you around here.
You understand?

40:32.663 --> 40:36.755
I... No, no, he's supposed to be here.
I think there's a mix-up

40:36.855 --> 40:39.892
because he was supposed to meet us
outside, but I think maybe he got scared.

40:39.992 --> 40:42.841
He's a black guy. Mickey,
he's a black guy. Did I tell you that?

40:42.941 --> 40:45.143
- You're being a fucking wiseass?
- No.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.568
Hey! Hey!

40:50.647 --> 40:55.287
You know what it's like to get slapped
in the mouth, Rose? There you go.

40:55.387 --> 40:58.623
What, are you fucking them
out of the cradle now?

40:58.923 --> 41:01.158
You know better.

41:01.258 --> 41:02.727
I ran into your twin.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.464
What'd you think, I was gonna
set this up without looking out first?

41:06.564 --> 41:09.968
First of all, twin? Are you kidding me?

41:10.068 --> 41:12.739
He don't even know him.

41:13.185 --> 41:18.430
He played you. He's just a fuckin' fan
watching the trial. Smarten up.

41:21.978 --> 41:24.238
You okay?

41:54.244 --> 41:58.839
Hey, man, yeah, they closed
the doors early. It's totally full.

42:01.851 --> 42:03.822
<i>This is "The Curtis Sliwa Show."</i>

42:03.922 --> 42:06.925

<i>My friends, trust me. They won't

42:13.330 --> 42:15.867
Rose, I'm sorry, but he's fired.

42:15.967 --> 42:19.436
This is his check for whatever
he supposedly did.

42:19.536 --> 42:22.941
Arthur... There's a mistake.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

42:23.041 --> 42:26.227
No, Rose, you know what?
You are making the mistake.

42:26.327 --> 42:30.755
- You are making a big mistake.
- What's that supposed to mean?

42:32.049 --> 42:33.551
You could do better.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.854
- Like you, Arthur? Is that it?
- No, not necessarily.

42:35.954 --> 42:37.940
No, you wanna fuck me, I know it.
You know what?

42:38.040 --> 42:41.559
I wouldn't fuck you with Julio's dick
and blame it on Marie in accounting.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.828
So draft out my fuckin' check
while you're at it.

42:43.928 --> 42:46.696
Thank you for the opportunity.

42:47.047 --> 42:50.761

Don't wanna get mixed up

Hey!

Hey! Hands up! Put your fuckin' hands up!

Good. Here, here.

46:48.839 --> 46:50.775
Here, here.

46:50.875 --> 46:54.078

You think I got fuckin' all day?
Here! Put this in the fuckin' bag!

47:15.736 --> 47:17.522
- Give me his watch.
- What does he want?

47:17.622 --> 47:19.271
- He wants your watch!
- My what?

47:19.371 --> 47:23.107
Forget the fuckin' watch! I don't care
about the watch. Hurry up, go.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.110
I want everything else.
Go ahead, go, put it in.

47:26.210 --> 47:29.414
Hey, what are you saying over there?
What are you saying?

47:29.514 --> 47:32.401
Turn around. Turn around.
Don't make eyes at him.

47:32.501 --> 47:34.967
You, what are you doing?

47:35.253 --> 47:39.123
Give me the fuckin' bag. Piece of shit.
The bag broke, what do you want me to do?

47:39.423 --> 47:41.329
Better watch your ass.

Get in.

48:03.602 --> 48:05.393
Fuck.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.389
I pissed myself.

48:12.489 --> 48:14.236
Well...

48:16.060 --> 48:18.362
It fuckin' happens.

48:18.462 --> 48:21.331
It happens, honey.

48:22.491 --> 48:25.770
Hey, you're amazing. Okay?
You're fuckin' amazing.

48:26.070 --> 48:29.830
You did it. You fuckin' did it.
You fuckin' did it!

48:40.284 --> 48:42.320
- There it is.
- You ready?

48:42.420 --> 48:46.431
- I think this is real.
- That's the real deal.

48:47.124 --> 48:49.527
They look like solid gold heels.

48:49.627 --> 48:51.529
Look, we got laserdisc.

48:51.629 --> 48:54.299
This machine plays movies like a record.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.868
Okay, it's like a record but it's a movie.

48:56.968 --> 48:58.569
Look at that, Rose.

48:58.669 --> 49:02.690
And a rope like that with the Christ.

49:02.790 --> 49:05.481
Christmas came early.

49:06.432 --> 49:09.113

- A new TV.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.737
No, no, no, wait.

49:11.949 --> 49:16.220
Hold up, we wanna try this out,
and we wanna try it out on video.

49:16.320 --> 49:20.057
Ma... no, but this phone, I can't...
it's not hooked into the wall.

49:20.157 --> 49:23.661
I can just go anywhere.
I could call you, I could be on the bus,

49:23.761 --> 49:27.031
I could be walking down the street,
I could... you could go to church,

49:27.131 --> 49:29.754
you could call me from inside church.

49:31.334 --> 49:33.638
Some of it just dropped... fuck.

49:33.738 --> 49:36.173
You ought to try smokin' it.

49:54.390 --> 49:57.461
It's gonna fuckin' launch you.

49:57.561 --> 50:02.293
It's gonna fuckin' launch you up there.
You understand?

50:04.500 --> 50:05.873
I don't know.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.308
- Hold it up.
- Be careful.

50:11.408 --> 50:14.367
I got it. I got it.

50:15.445 --> 50:19.083
Pull it, pull it.
Pull it right the fuck down.

50:19.183 --> 50:22.978
Pull it. Smoke the fuckin' shit
out of that.

50:25.789 --> 50:29.293
Holy shit! Holy shit.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

50:34.430 --> 50:35.633
Yeah.

50:35.733 --> 50:39.370
So what's... what's with the getups?

50:39.470 --> 50:41.795
Tell me the story.

6:00 p.m.

50:53.131 --> 50:56.687
There were four designated shooters.
Vincent Atuso, John Carneglia,

50:56.787 --> 50:59.023
Edward Lino,
and his brother-in-law Sal Scala.

50:59.423 --> 51:01.992
Pull it. Pull it.

51:02.092 --> 51:05.529
Deep. Take it deep.

51:06.549 --> 51:08.598
Holy shit.

51:08.698 --> 51:12.926
They wore white trench coats
and cossack hats.

51:15.439 --> 51:19.477
Gotti knew they'd pay more attention
to the outfits than the shooters.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.802
The fuckin' man was brilliant.

51:29.519 --> 51:31.622
- Who's he?
- Paul Castellano,

51:31.722 --> 51:34.981
a.k.a. The Howard Hughes of the mob.

51:37.227 --> 51:39.397
Never left his mansion.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.794
That's scary.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.225
Never even saw it coming.

51:53.677 --> 51:55.000
Bang.

52:10.693 --> 52:14.832
<i>...take over an empire of dirty money
and power built on drugs,</i>

52:14.932 --> 52:17.168
<i>flesh-peddling, violence,
and intimidation.</i>

52:17.268 --> 52:20.838
<i>As he stepped from his black Lincoln,
three men wearing fur hats and trench coats</i>

52:20.938 --> 52:23.174
<i>pumped six bullets
into "Big Paul" Castellano,</i>

52:23.274 --> 52:26.277
<i>the man considered boss
of all mob bosses in the country,</i>

52:26.377 --> 52:28.901
<i>and then calmly walked away.</i>

52:29.212 --> 52:32.350
Excuse me! Hi, dreamboat.
Can you help me out here? I'm lost.

52:32.450 --> 52:35.386
Go back. Come on, get in!

52:35.486 --> 52:39.257
Get in, get in! Fuck. Get in.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.192
- Get in.
- Hey!

52:41.492 --> 52:43.461
Turn around. Turn around!

52:44.861 --> 52:47.899
- He's fuckin' following us!
- Nobody's following us.

52:48.499 --> 52:51.134
Put all the fuckin' money in the bag!

52:51.234 --> 52:53.067
Come on!

52:53.367 --> 52:56.641
All right, hands up!
Put all the fuckin' money in the bag.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.944
- Come on, this watch.
- Get in the car!

53:00.644 --> 53:02.836
We got everything.

53:04.364 --> 53:06.167
Put your fuckin' hands up.

53:07.307 --> 53:08.669
This is for you.

53:10.047 --> 53:11.928
This is heavy.

53:15.859 --> 53:19.497
Back the fuck up! Come on,
I'm gonna make an example out of you!

53:19.697 --> 53:21.732
Who knows that guy? Who knows that guy?

53:21.832 --> 53:24.257
- Get in, get in!
- He's dead!

53:30.774 --> 53:33.444
<i>They robbed six fuckin' clubs
in the last month.</i>

53:33.544 --> 53:36.267
<i>They robbed the Hawaiian twice.</i>

53:36.367 --> 53:38.140
- <i>Do you think it was Colombo?</i>
- <i>I have no idea.</i>

53:38.240 --> 53:40.284
- <i>Gambinos?</i>
- <i>He looked high as a kite.</i>

53:40.384 --> 53:43.464
- <i>Took her watch instead of her cash.</i>
- <i>Duke, I think I know who's doing this.</i>

53:43.564 --> 53:46.691
- <i>Give Johnny Lacola a call.</i>
- <i>The cocksuckers took my fuckin' watch!</i>

53:46.791 --> 53:48.593
<i>Who would hit that place?
It's supposed to be protected.</i>

53:48.693 --> 53:52.045
- <i>The kid just robbed us.</i>
- <i>No, they didn't touch Bergen.</i>

53:52.145 --> 53:54.070
<i>They can try.</i>

53:54.697 --> 53:57.401
<i>Nah, I know Rose.</i>

53:57.501 --> 53:59.970
<i>I know where their mother lives.</i>

54:00.070 --> 54:01.805
<i>She's fucking crazy.</i>

54:01.905 --> 54:04.442
<i>Sure, no problem.
All right, give it to me.</i>

54:04.542 --> 54:08.713
<i>H529U... something.</i>

54:09.813 --> 54:13.818
- Look at that.
- I already got... Let it go.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.975
That's good.

54:16.753 --> 54:20.958
November 22, 1992.

54:21.058 --> 54:26.330
With my lovely, lovely Rose.

54:26.430 --> 54:30.456
My girl, my lady, my queen, my queen bee.

54:33.236 --> 54:35.506
Keep your eyes closed.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.609
Are you ready? Do you trust me?

54:38.709 --> 54:40.467
I trust you.

54:47.150 --> 54:50.287
Up your nose. It's glitter.

54:59.596 --> 55:01.762
You're short.

55:01.862 --> 55:03.356
You're tall.

55:08.004 --> 55:10.474
Do you wanna stop?

55:10.574 --> 55:12.899
Are you scared?

55:22.218 --> 55:24.121
I don't wanna stop.

55:24.221 --> 55:26.380
You sure?

55:35.998 --> 55:38.836
Hey, wait here. I got something for you.

55:38.936 --> 55:41.995
- I thought we were going to the diner.
- In a minute.

55:44.775 --> 55:48.034
What is it? What'd you do?

55:51.014 --> 55:52.583
Holy shit.

55:52.683 --> 55:55.770
- It's a surprise for you!
- Holy shit.

55:55.870 --> 55:57.254
"Since John Gotti's conviction,

55:57.354 --> 55:59.249
there have been reports of deaths
around his old stomping..."

55:59.349 --> 56:01.792
- Does it say our names?
- No.

56:01.892 --> 56:04.537
"No one's really sure who's behind
these recent events, but it seems clear

56:04.637 --> 56:06.997
"that these occurrences
would likely not be taking place

56:07.097 --> 56:08.699
if it wasn't for his recent conviction."

56:08.799 --> 56:10.960
How the fuck did they get this?
You did this?

56:11.060 --> 56:12.667
- Yeah.
- Now they all know.

56:12.767 --> 56:16.507
- Yeah.
- Holy shit. I can't fucking believe this.

56:16.807 --> 56:19.577
I'd have 'em put in
fucking stone if I could.

56:19.977 --> 56:21.946
You like it?

56:22.046 --> 56:25.516
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me? I fucking love it.

56:25.616 --> 56:28.682
- You...
- I fucking love this. Come here!

56:31.221 --> 56:33.579
Fuckin' love it.

56:34.390 --> 56:36.315
You know what?

56:38.327 --> 56:42.699
You look amazing. I just...
I wanna save this right here.

56:42.799 --> 56:45.491
Wherever the fuck we are.

56:46.636 --> 56:49.105
Just give me a second.

56:54.343 --> 56:57.323
- Will you marry me?
- Don't fuck with me.

56:57.423 --> 57:00.576
- I'm not fucking with you. Will you marry me?
- Don't you fuck with me!

57:00.676 --> 57:04.535
I'm not fucking with you!
I'm on a knee! Will you marry me?

57:04.635 --> 57:09.115
- Come on, Rose.
- I do! I do! I do!

57:12.428 --> 57:13.670
Bellissimo.

57:17.733 --> 57:18.969
Bene.

57:19.369 --> 57:23.496
- Capone was smiling or no?
- No, he's... serious...

57:25.709 --> 57:29.095
- I wanna see the look.
- Okay. Look at the look.

57:29.195 --> 57:30.914
Look at the look.

57:31.014 --> 57:34.849
First of all, my wife is a lot better-looking
than Mae Coughlin, that's all I'm gonna say.

57:34.949 --> 57:37.487
You know what it is?
You got no love in your life.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.490
I see the same bullshit over and over.

57:39.790 --> 57:43.828
You're all fucking miserable.
Each and every one of you. You know that?

57:43.928 --> 57:47.798
- What town is this?
- The town of Vizzini.

57:47.898 --> 57:49.299
- What is it?
- Vizzini.

57:49.399 --> 57:53.859
Vizzini. That's what this is?
How come everything looks the same?

57:55.471 --> 57:57.822
Looks like a shithole.

57:57.922 --> 58:00.501
We just got married!

58:00.811 --> 58:03.052
Okay, now smile...
Is there teeth or no teeth?

58:03.152 --> 58:04.654
Little teeth.

58:04.754 --> 58:07.404
Here she goes. Boom!

58:07.504 --> 58:09.720
You caught it! You're gonna get married!

58:09.820 --> 58:11.455
- You're gonna get married.
- Married?

58:11.555 --> 58:13.357
- To a guy, I think.
- Congratulations.

58:13.457 --> 58:14.792
You know what? Drop your pants.

58:14.892 --> 58:17.361
Come on, is it necessary?
We already gave you the money.

58:17.461 --> 58:20.965
It's fuckin' necessary.
Drop your fuckin' pants.

58:21.065 --> 58:25.102
Come on, you got the money.
Just leave us alone. We're playing cards.

58:25.202 --> 58:27.831
No, I know that you were playing cards.
I'm not fuckin' stupid.

58:27.931 --> 58:30.863
Drop your fuckin' pants!

58:39.482 --> 58:43.387
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
What, do you got the Yankees game on that?

58:43.487 --> 58:45.723
You got a fuckin' rat in here?

58:46.623 --> 58:48.481
I'm not a rat.

58:49.725 --> 58:53.186
Nah. Hey, good luck with that.

58:55.097 --> 58:58.302
This is what I wanna do.
I wanna make a toast!

58:58.402 --> 59:00.945
To my bride! To my fuckin' bride.

59:01.045 --> 59:03.207
Last call. Drink up, drink up, now.

59:03.307 --> 59:06.243
- Hey, we want two more!
- Fin! Hold on, fill this up here.

59:06.343 --> 59:08.012
There you go, fill this up.

59:08.312 --> 59:12.404
He's okay, give him a couple
of drinks, all right? Enjoy.

59:13.217 --> 59:15.886
Come on! Look at this!
The best fuckin' wedding gift.

59:15.986 --> 59:18.502
Look who it is, Paulie...

59:18.602 --> 59:21.158
- Paulie!
- Take it easy.

59:21.258 --> 59:24.361
Hey, look at this, we got married.
Hey, Paulie, how you doin'?

59:24.461 --> 59:26.627

59:29.120 --> 59:33.159
- What? What are you sorry about?
- I don't know who you are.

59:34.871 --> 59:37.462
What, you don't remember me?

59:38.207 --> 59:39.573
You hear this?

59:39.673 --> 59:43.163
Wow! You don't remember me?
You don't remember your fuckin' friends?

59:43.263 --> 59:46.550
- You should get a real fuckin' slap.
- I have to ask you to...

59:46.650 --> 59:49.804
Don't fuckin' touch me, all right?
This is my fuckin' wedding night.

59:49.904 --> 59:53.404
- What are you asking me for? This cocksucker?
- Take it outside.

59:53.504 --> 59:55.826
Take what out? You know what,
I'm gonna take outside? This.

59:55.926 --> 59:58.228
- I'm gonna take this outside.
- Cool down, man, come on.

59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.039
- Yeah? Yeah?

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:02.833
- What's the matter, Paulie...
- What the fuck?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.903
Asshole! Fuckin' ruined my wedding.

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:09.106

Here, here's the bar.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:13.720
Here, you know what? That's what it means.
Nothing. Fuck you, you fuckin' rat.

<i>You're listening to AM 77 WABC.
It's "The Curtis Sliwa Show."</i>

He wants to talk this way about John
while the rats sit around and let him?

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.056
Fine. I don't want to hear it anymore.

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.627
You think they fuckin' care?
Nobody cares anymore.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:41.320
'Cause he's a fuckin' rat.
Fuckin' rat! Rat!

A few guys came to Mama's house yesterday
asking questions, and they weren't cops.

01:02:13.462 --> 01:02:15.933
- Let's go. Let's go!
- She's not going anywhere.

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:18.243

Hey, Thomas, did you hear?

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:15.052
John Gotti's going to jail... for life...

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.943
without the possibility of parole.

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.959
No more five families.

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.411
The mafia...

01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:28.702
as an institution, is no more.

01:04:29.302 --> 01:04:34.676
Yeah. So why don't you put that
in your pipe and smoke it?

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.342
<i>I have personal friends out there.</i>

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:42.979
<i>I know firsthand the damage
that this degenerate does is real.</i>

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:47.717
<i>It is all smoke and mirrors.
This man's business is murder.</i>

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:50.520
<i>I get press all the time. They inspire me.</i>

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.357
<i>They give me new life.
I know I'm doing my job.</i>

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:55.492
<i>It's you guys who are myth-makers.</i>

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.228
<i>You gotta sell your newspapers,
you gotta sell your air time.</i>

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:01.431
<i>Let's call a spade a spade.
The man is a murderer.</i>

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:05.669
<i>And then I hear... I hear they're
reporting Sammy the Bull as a rat.</i>

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:08.360
<i>I hear newsmen like...</i>

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:13.214
- I found out where he lives.
- <i>Who?</i>

01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:16.146
Sliwa. Fuckin' Sliwa.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.016
I know exactly where he lives.
I need my driver.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.051
What are you talking about?

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:25.188
You think I'm shit?
Is that what you think?

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:27.858
No. Why do you say that?
What are you talking about?

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:31.161
Come on, Rose, I need you.
I need your help.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.586
He takes a taxi every morning at 7:15.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.378
Thomas...

01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:45.330
You're not coming in that clear.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:49.449
<i>You're not coming through clear.
I think it's the pollution.</i>

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.917
You're coming through in waves, Rose,
you're coming through in waves.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:58.255
Honey... I can't come back right now.
I can't leave her yet, not like this.

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:02.081
I'm scared for you in Queens.
I wanna come get you.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.251
Get the fuck out.

01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:07.597
No.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.333
I hear him back there. I gotta go.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.104
Fuck!

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.740
What? Get a life, Anthony!

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.244
This is my husband! Okay?
He needs me! He needs me.

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:24.878
- Tell me what kind of trouble you're in!
- I'm not in trouble!

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:26.714
I can help you!

01:06:26.814 --> 01:06:31.001
I talked to Theresa. She'll put you up.
You can get work up there.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:35.181
Just get away from it all, just get out.
Get away from it.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:00.673
<i>Una space.</i>

01:07:08.123 --> 01:07:11.228
Hey... Hey, Sally.

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:14.131
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Motherfucker!

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.689
- Now!
- Leave, motherfucker!

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.705
That's it!

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:24.841
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- That's it! That's it.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.244
- Pick him up and put him out!
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:29.345
- Pick him up and put him out!
- Piece of shit!

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.116
Make sure he stays the fuck out of here!
Make sure he stays out!

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:37.065
You know now.
Take a walk, piece of shit...

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:40.512
Get the fuck out. Get him out of here.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.509
Did I tell you?

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:02.545
I told you, Thomas.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:07.584
Yeah, inside report said Gotti
was taken to the infirmary...

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:11.989
with a busted lip
and swelling to his cheekbone.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:16.059
Little-known African-American bank robber.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:19.973
He had his way
with the coward of all cowards.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.613
See, Thomas?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.515
He is just like you.

01:08:36.478 --> 01:08:37.814
Hey.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:42.774
Hey, wake up. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
It's me. Hold on.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.823
- Thomas, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:49.993
What happened?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.129
Nothing.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:53.886
Nothing?

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:59.491
- I had an accident.
- What kind of accident?

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:03.337
- Where's Rose?
- She's in Queens.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.308
- He's here?
- Who's here? Did you hit your head?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.746
- No. He's here? He said so.
- Turn around. Sit down.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.848
- Come inside.
- I'm all right.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.406
I'll give you a band-aid.

01:09:15.183 --> 01:09:17.254
Take this.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.425
No, no, no. I don't want your money.

01:09:19.524 --> 01:09:22.148
That was... I gave that to you
to get you back on your feet.

01:09:22.247 --> 01:09:26.499
- I don't need it. I'm on my feet.
- I don't want it. You're barely on your feet.

01:09:26.599 --> 01:09:29.316
I don't want it. Take it back.
I don't want it. Take your money.

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:31.273
Take it.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.104
What?

01:09:36.203 --> 01:09:39.206
Come inside and let me
clean that up, okay?

01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:43.145
- That looks really fuckin' bad, man.
- You gotta do me a favor.

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:46.950
If you stay here, it's gonna fuckin'
kill you. You gotta get out of here.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.252
- Okay.
- I'm serious, Ally. Ally.

01:09:49.353 --> 01:09:51.220
I'm going to Park Avenue tomorrow.

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:55.358
Don't go, okay? You can't drive
like that. You're fucked up.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:58.750
Wake up, Thomas, wake up!

01:10:33.538 --> 01:10:36.065
I missed you.

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:38.090
I'm here.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:51.942
This is exactly where I met you.

01:10:58.119 --> 01:11:01.113
Give the boys my best.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.436
That's what they are, right?

01:11:03.536 --> 01:11:06.084
Little fucking boys.

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:44.289
Is it just you?

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.910
This is it?

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:00.755
Who's in there?

01:13:03.311 --> 01:13:07.083
- <i>Buona sera.</i>
- Who else is here? It's just you two?

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:11.153
- Nobody.
- Just you two?

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:15.040
Yeah. What about you?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.392
Are you alone?

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.553
You mean business?

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.429
You got big balls.

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:08.515
Me and you, come on.

01:14:17.251 --> 01:14:18.944
- John?
- <i>Si.</i>

01:14:57.959 --> 01:15:00.186
Why is the door red?

01:15:00.336 --> 01:15:01.971
The door, why is it red?

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:10.095
Nobody knows. It's red.

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:24.454
We Sicilians...
we've been grounded up like coffee.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.710
Arabic, Norman, Spanish, Greek.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.016
We don't know anymore who we are.

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.314
No.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:18.107
It's a dream. I wish I was there.

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:21.332
But things have changed there, too.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:25.848
They made the canyon to build this guy.

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:29.811
Things are not the same... anymore.

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:32.507
Got your...

01:17:01.549 --> 01:17:03.575
I'm sorry.

01:17:08.723 --> 01:17:10.716
There's nothing in it.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.620
Look, there's a flower.

01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:27.243
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.917
Go to sleep.

01:18:10.885 --> 01:18:15.080
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Is the light on? The light on?

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.954
67th and Columbus.

01:18:26.199 --> 01:18:28.536
Fuck! Fuck!

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:31.083
Shit!

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:37.012
Go! Go!

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:40.951
Help! Help!

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:17.353
Come on... hey.
Hey, we gotta ditch this car.

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.411
I'm sorry.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:30.755
It's okay, okay?

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:37.655
It's all over.

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.866
Okay?

01:19:39.966 --> 01:19:42.013
It's over.

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:47.817
We don't have to do it anymore.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:50.508
- I'm sorry.
- I promise.

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:54.957
Don't cry, baby.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:57.593
Don't... don't cry.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:59.951
It's okay.

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:09.438
<i>All news, all the time. This is 1010 wins.</i>

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:13.761
<i>You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.</i>

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:17.637
<i>Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian
Angels and talk show host,</i>

his home this morning.</i>

<i>Sliwa is in stable condition

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:42.360
Thank you.

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:46.497
Two lobster tails.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.367
Just two?

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:52.342
Your brother Anthony was in this morning.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:21:00.279
I guess you don't see him much.
The baby is so cute.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:06.083
What about you, Rose?

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.238
What about me?

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:14.358
When are you having one?

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.328
I'm pregnant, Annie.

01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:22.133
I didn't know.

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:26.182
Who's the father?

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.707
The ice cream man.

01:22:40.672 --> 01:22:42.898
Sliwa's not dead.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.305
They're saying Junior's boys shot him.

01:22:51.899 --> 01:22:54.729

Why don't we just drive around
for a while?

01:23:07.815 --> 01:23:10.386
It's all these people.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.160
I don't know.

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:28.159
What?

01:23:41.949 --> 01:23:46.070
- Hey, close your eyes.
- What? What are you...
