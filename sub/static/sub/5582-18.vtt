WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:06.774
* To my girls and boys
who are feelin' naughty *

00:06.807 --> 00:08.376
* Raise a glass,
the drinks are on me... *

00:08.409 --> 00:11.479
Let's get
this party going, ladies!

00:13.214 --> 00:14.548
Oh, hell no!

00:15.449 --> 00:17.318
This is your bachelorette party,
bitch-- up!

00:17.351 --> 00:19.287
Get up! Get up!
No.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.455
Sleep. Must sleep.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.524
No, party, girl!
Must party!

00:23.557 --> 00:26.594
Okay? Come on!

00:26.627 --> 00:28.596
Can someone give
this woman a shot!

00:28.629 --> 00:30.531
Get our drink on!

00:31.732 --> 00:34.568
Take it down, girl!

00:34.602 --> 00:36.770
El-- Ellie!

00:36.804 --> 00:39.140
Hey, what the hell's
going on back there?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.808
Just a plastered bride!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.582
Oh, my God.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.288
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:54.322 --> 00:56.724
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:56.757 --> 00:59.427
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:59.460 --> 01:00.694
* How, how, how, how

01:00.728 --> 01:03.131
* Hey, hey

01:08.769 --> 01:10.371
* You gotta come on.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.709
Oh, my God.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.245
Please tell me
you did not

01:17.278 --> 01:18.512
wear that shirt in public.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.713
Oh, I wore it.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.215
And I wore it
loud and proud.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.716
It's my lucky shirt.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.718
You don't want to mess
around with St. Patty's day.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.521
I'm sorry,
but this is one holiday

01:27.555 --> 01:28.856
I do not comprehend.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.259
I mean, it's supposed
to last a day.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.694
Why does this city
celebrate it for ten?

01:33.727 --> 01:37.531
Well, we just need one reason
to have ten days of fun.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.268
Hey, what's your beef
with St. Patty's anyway?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.703
All right, you know
how during the parades

01:42.736 --> 01:46.440
they sometimes throw potatoes
off the float?

01:46.474 --> 01:47.441
Yep.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.143
Well, I may or may not have

01:49.177 --> 01:51.279
been knocked unconscious.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.782
Top of the morning to you.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.849
Morning.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.751
Look.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.720
The problem is you haven't
celebrated NCIS style.

01:59.753 --> 02:03.691
All right, every year,
King throws one heck of a party.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.194
Yep, and this year,
Brody's gonna make her family's

02:06.227 --> 02:07.628
famous Irish stew.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.796
Well, that was the plan,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.598
but I might have
to improvise a little bit.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.700
I can't find my recipe book.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.302
It must be in one of my boxes.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.637
What do you mean "boxes"?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.340
Boxes-- you know,
where I keep my stuff.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.674
Brody, you've been
here two years.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.610
Yeah, but you know,
some of the stuff

02:22.643 --> 02:24.712
was shipped down after
I had been here for a while.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.314
But just to be clear.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.316
You still haven't unpacked?

02:28.349 --> 02:29.650
I've been busy.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.588
We got a dead sailor
in the Quarter.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.425
Let's move.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.696
According to the I.D., the
victim is Chief Warrant Officer

02:42.730 --> 02:44.832
Evan Babish.
Folks on the bus said

02:44.865 --> 02:46.767
he was in the middle
of the road; no idea why.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.702
Driver didn't see him
till it was too late.

02:48.736 --> 02:52.273
Doesn't look like
our witnesses are very reliable.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.408
I'm sure our man will
get to the bottom of it.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.776
Miss Loretta?

02:55.809 --> 02:56.677
What's the word?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.212
Can I have three?

02:58.246 --> 02:59.847
Blunt force trauma.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.983
Ten tons of bus running
into 200 pounds of human

03:03.016 --> 03:04.552
can have that effect.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.820
BRODY:
What happened here?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.356
WADE:
A wound.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.757
And some sort of rash.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.260
It's the first
unusual finding thus far.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.262
Can I add another one?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.630
The road's a straight shot.

03:16.664 --> 03:20.368
Babish would've seen the bus
coming a thousand yards off.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.304
So why be in the road
just as it's coming?

03:23.337 --> 03:24.438
Suicide?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.274
Or...

03:27.975 --> 03:29.610
...he was pushed.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.911
These look like scratch marks,

03:30.944 --> 03:32.780
like he was in a struggle.

03:32.813 --> 03:36.317
Possibly, but it might also
have been from the collision.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.753
Well, whatever it was,
we owe it to Babish to find out.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.823
Brody and Sonja,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.858
track down
security camera footage.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.560
Meantime,

03:46.594 --> 03:48.862
I'll help Lasalle canvass
for witnesses.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.698
SONJA: Well,
maybe Chris

03:50.731 --> 03:52.466
learned something
from his new friends.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.702
One less daiquiri
and they could've been useful.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.704
Sure you don't want
to give it another try?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.972
Practice your enhanced
interrogation techniques?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.675
Y'all have dirty minds.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
Yep, I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.787
Are you and Lasalle

04:13.821 --> 04:15.456
shopping at the same store now?

04:15.489 --> 04:17.391
You guys buy underwear
together, too?

04:17.425 --> 04:19.293
No.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.928
Triple P don't wear drawers.
Okay.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.797
Fewer things I got to put on
in the morning, the better.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.433
TMI, my friend.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.968
You, uh, have anything
for us, Commando?

04:28.001 --> 04:30.638
'Cause I'm getting nothing
on these security cams.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.640
In fact, I do.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.743
According to Navy records,
Babish was supposed to return

04:35.776 --> 04:38.946
to active duty yesterday,
but dude was a no-show.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.314
Why wasn't he active duty?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.782
Oh, he was taking part

04:41.815 --> 04:43.351
in the Career
Intermission Program.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.785
SONJA: Oh, I know that--
lets, uh,

04:44.818 --> 04:47.355
burnt-out sailors pursue
other career interests.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.690
Babish's case, he went
all Woodward and Bernstein.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.824
Newspaper reporter.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.860
My man was impressive.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.928
He was working
at The Houston Globe,

04:54.962 --> 04:58.932
working on their long-term
investigative squad, Forefront.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.834
"Forefront"-- are you,
are you positive?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.903
Yeah.
That mean
something to you, Mer?

05:02.936 --> 05:03.904
Maybe.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.874
That's Pride.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.709
"No luck finding
other witnesses.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.544
But Wade has info for us."

05:10.578 --> 05:11.612
I'll meet him there.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.414
I got this.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.048
Okay...

05:15.082 --> 05:17.918
WADE:
Whenever a coroner sees

05:17.951 --> 05:19.753
elevated blood alcohol levels,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.455
alarms start going off.

05:21.489 --> 05:24.091
You think it must be
a contributing factor.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.360
I can see why you'd go there.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.729
Babish clocked in at .15.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.097
Well, if he was
that drunk,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.032
it would explain why he
didn't see the bus coming.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.967
It could.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.069
And you could easily write this
incident off as an accident.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.573
But I decided to dig
a little deeper.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.874
What you find?

05:40.908 --> 05:42.776
Unidentified DNA
inside the scratches.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.812
They weren't from
the collision.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.447
These were fingernail scratches.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.015
They were fresh.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.985
And that very same DNA
was also under Babish's nails.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.622
So someone grabs his wrists,
he tries to fight them off?

05:54.655 --> 05:55.889
And the same person
pushed him into the street

05:55.923 --> 05:57.558
as the bus was coming?

05:57.591 --> 05:58.992
SEBASTIAN: To make it
look like an accident.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.028
It's not the first time
we've seen that.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.698
Are you offering something?

06:04.732 --> 06:05.999
Uh, no.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.635
I just wanted to note
that this isn't

06:07.668 --> 06:10.404
the first time something
like this has happened.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.973
I'm gonna call Babish's
commanding officer.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.143
See if he has any idea
why Babish missed his check-in.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.678
I'll catch up with you later.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.013
Everything all right?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.718
Hey, um,
Hey.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.953
are we both thinking
the same thing right now?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.888
I think so.
Are we being crazy?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.990
I don't know.
All right, you talk first.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.760
Okay, uh, first of all,
there's Babish's work.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.027
Newspaper reporter,
Houston Globe.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.195
Just like my sister.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.196
Forefront team.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.598
Just like my sister.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.666
Both killed by vehicles.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.767
And both deaths were made

06:39.800 --> 06:42.069
to look like
they were accidental.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.704
Sebastian,
do you think this case

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
is connected
to my sister's murder?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.907
I mean, statistically speaking--

06:46.940 --> 06:48.776
No, I mean, I mean, your gut.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.944
I think maybe.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.713
Yeah.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.047
That means if we're right,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.516
and we solve Babish's murder...

06:55.549 --> 06:59.019
Maybe we can solve
my sister's, too.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.701
Warrant Officer Evan Babish,

07:13.734 --> 07:15.669
38 years old,
stellar Navy record.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.571
But three years ago,
he needed a break.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.707
Found new horizons
at The Houston Globe.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.075
Now, yesterday he was
supposed to return to service,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.911
but he didn't show up.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.546
The C.O. had no idea why.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.880
Soda bread.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.148
Neither did Babish's family.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.017
Now, they live in 'Bama,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.752
but they raised Babish
in Lafitte.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.153
They still have a house there.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.989
Said maybe he went there
to check it out?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.526
There's one thing
we do know for sure,

07:38.559 --> 07:41.729
and that's Babish made a phone
call two minutes before he died.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.064
Yes, to a Jessica Levy.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.033
Now, she's a fellow employee
at The Globe,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.768
and Facebook says
they're in a relationship,

07:47.801 --> 07:50.103
so maybe we should ask her.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.806
Other than that,
we got nothing?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.141
I may have something.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.142
What is it?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.044
You guys need to see this.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.515
Now, just here me out.
Let me just say it.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.984
I think my sister's death

08:04.017 --> 08:05.953
may be connected
to Babish's case.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.287
What are you talking about?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.289
You know that Emily was run over

08:09.322 --> 08:11.692
by a drunk driver
named Edward Lamb.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.694
And you know

08:13.727 --> 08:16.664
I was sent these photos.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.799
What you don't know
is that each one of them

08:18.832 --> 08:21.034
contained a hidden number,

08:21.068 --> 08:23.537
which formed an IP address,
which led me and Sebastian

08:23.571 --> 08:26.073
to Emily's page
on an unsolved murder site.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.176
What if her death
wasn't just an accident?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.310
I mean, what if
she was targeted?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.979
Think about it.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.146
Both she and Babish worked

08:33.180 --> 08:36.149
at the same paper
on the same team,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.284
and they died
in a similar way.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.752
I mean, we...

08:38.786 --> 08:40.788
we could have
something here.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.726
We need to talk this out.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.327
We know that Lamb
drove the car

08:47.360 --> 08:50.230
that killed your sister.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.268
Have you found some connection
between him and Babish?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.070
Not yet.
I wanted to question Lamb,

08:57.104 --> 08:59.306
but he's MIA, released
from prison six months ago.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.141
He's been off the grid
ever since.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.243
Well, have you found evidence
other than these photos

09:03.276 --> 09:06.614
that Emily's death
was not an accident?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.582
Believe me, I have tried, but it
is an eight-year-old case.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.985
It's not exactly easy
for us to open it up

09:12.019 --> 09:13.153
for reinvestigation.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.255
You and Sebastian?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.323
Yeah.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.258
Well, I hate to say it,

09:18.291 --> 09:21.695
but I think we all know he's
prone to conspiracy theories.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.096
Well, I'm not.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.965
And I know when
something is off.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.333
And you may be right.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.036
Emily may have been murdered.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.706
But we know Warrant
Officer Babish was.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.008
I'm gonna pay
a visit to The Globe.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.610
That's where Babish worked.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.847
That's where we'll
learn things about him.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.314
In the meantime,
you all stay here.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.116
Track anything

09:43.150 --> 09:44.852
that Babish might've
been up to here in town.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.319
Pride.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.288
If there is
any connection to Emily,

09:48.321 --> 09:50.658
I will not be able to spot it
from here

09:50.691 --> 09:52.025
Look, Brody--
Listen.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.227
My focus will be on Babish.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.362
I promise.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.197
Okay.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.867
Get your stuff.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.679
Doing all right?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.080
Yeah, I'm good.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.917
Brody?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.919
Answers you want--

10:18.952 --> 10:22.389
I've seen a lot of grieving
people chase the same thing.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.925
And they chase it...

10:24.958 --> 10:27.194
right down the rabbit hole.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.029
That's a dark place to be.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.399
I don't want that
to happen to you.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.768
It won't.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.205
Just to be sure.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.974
Emily's fiancé still
runs Forefront.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.745
His parents are
still the publishers.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.215
Last thing you want to do
is reopen old wounds.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.284
WOMAN:
Meredith?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.322
It's been too long.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.825
Hi, Nancy.

10:57.858 --> 10:58.992
No, no, listen.
I got to go. I got to go.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.028
Evan Babish's death

11:01.061 --> 11:02.696
is just hitting the wires.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.264
How are you, my love?
Hi, Robert.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.298
Hi.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.235
Mr. and Mrs. Nolan,

11:08.268 --> 11:10.137
I'm Special Agent Dwayne Pride.
How do you do?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.305
Promise we won't take up
too much of your time.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.842
Oh, no, please,
however we can be of service.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.309
Well, first off,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.779
we'd like to know anything
Evan was working on.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.013
Um...

11:20.047 --> 11:21.715
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.316
God, I got to take this.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.052
I'm sorry, my apologies.
Nancy?

11:25.085 --> 11:27.320
Yes, of course.
This is Robert.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.289
Well, to answer your question,

11:29.322 --> 11:31.224
Forefront just published
a major piece

11:31.258 --> 11:33.226
on a corrupt
class-action lawyer.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.828
Did you notice any unusual
negative response?

11:34.862 --> 11:37.497
Any threats made to Evan?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.366
Well, there's always
a negative response,

11:39.399 --> 11:42.135
but I think the folks
at Forefront would know best.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.504
Why don't I show you
to their offices?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.740
Uh, will Daniel be there?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.308
NANCY:
No, dear.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.977
He's on assignment.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.013
We also understand that
Evan's girlfriend works here?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.882
Jessica, yes.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.384
She's our "I.T. guy"
for lack of a better term.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.286
She just heard the news.
Poor thing.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.154
I'd like to chat
with her, too.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.255
Oh, okay.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.924
Uh, Jonathan?

12:03.957 --> 12:06.827
Could you please take
Agent Pride to Jessica?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.229
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.464
LASALLE:
I haven't seen you
so invested in a case

12:11.498 --> 12:13.934
since you saw Elvis
at the Napoleon House last year.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.235
He was there, all right?

12:15.268 --> 12:16.303
And I don't know.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.437
This means a lot to Brody.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.939
I just want to help.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.074
Well, we all want to help.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.175
LASALLE:
And we could've.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.411
All you had to do was ask.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.079
So, what do you got,
Miss Loretta?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.180
Wait, wait, hold on.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.182
I was respecting Merri's wishes.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.919
Are you guys, like, mad at me?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.386
No, dear,
we're simply concerned.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.322
Meredith is in a very
sensitive position.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.325
She's not in her
clearest state of mind.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.360
Yeah, especially
with you in her ear.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.295
You think I'm leading her on?
Well, you are the guy

12:42.329 --> 12:44.297
who said JFK
got abducted by aliens.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.466
I don't say that.
The evidence does.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.435
The point is getting
someone's hopes too high

12:48.468 --> 12:50.503
can be a dangerous thing.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.807
Yeah, but so is living
your life in darkness.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.276
Now, are you gonna tell me
what you got or not?

12:56.309 --> 12:59.012
All right, what we know
is Babish was using

12:59.046 --> 13:01.348
a credit card in town
the last two days.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.516
He rented a car.
NOPD found it.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.919
Patton's running the GPS.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.087
So, you're nowhere.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.355
Great, so are we.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.457
We are not nowhere.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.193
We have already
identified Babish's rash.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.428
Well, what we thought
was a rash.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.330
It's actually
a staph infection.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.567
Likely caused by
that puncture wound.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.403
Based on the shape
and depth of the injury,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.338
I'd venture he
recently made contact

13:25.372 --> 13:28.241
with some sort
of metal spike.

13:28.275 --> 13:32.079
Yeah, like I said-- nowhere.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.482
I can still hear his voice.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.985
Evan had this, like,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.954
really funny way he talked.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.056
Sort of "country cool."

13:43.090 --> 13:44.457
He was from the sticks,
different from

13:44.491 --> 13:46.393
most people here.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.262
Jessica, you got
a call from Evan

13:49.296 --> 13:50.998
right before
he passed away.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.632
What'd you talk about?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.235
We had just broken up.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.237
He was going back to the Navy.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.539
And I was begging him not to.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.042
It wasn't easy
for either of us.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.077
Might explain why
he was drinking.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.879
Was he?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.647
He didn't seem drunk.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.918
Well, his blood alcohol
level was pretty high.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.552
Did Evan

14:12.585 --> 14:14.521
tell you what he was
up to yesterday

14:14.554 --> 14:15.522
before you spoke?

14:15.555 --> 14:18.491
The-the last few weeks,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.228
something was off.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.030
Evan was just preoccupied
with something,

14:23.063 --> 14:25.398
like obsessively.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.567
I-I-I think he was
trying to finish something

14:27.600 --> 14:29.536
before he was going
back to the Navy.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.670
What was going on?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.372
He wouldn't say.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.342
But all-all
I can think is that

14:35.375 --> 14:37.444
it had something to do

14:37.477 --> 14:40.413
with one of his stories.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.349
NANCY:
Well, the last story
he was assigned

14:42.382 --> 14:44.184
was already
published.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.452
The corrupt lawyer piece?

14:46.486 --> 14:47.921
Jared Zorn.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.289
Works out of Louisiana.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.124
Specializes
in getting compensation

14:51.158 --> 14:54.594
for Gulf Coast communities
affected by oil spills.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.429
But what we proved

14:56.463 --> 14:59.166
is that Zorn was
siphoning vast amounts

14:59.199 --> 15:00.433
into his own account.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.002
That's a big story.
Mm-hmm.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.603
Keeps people reading us,
instead of some blog.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.272
Without pieces like this,

15:05.305 --> 15:09.376
The Globe would go
the way of the dodo.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.577
And my husband would have

15:10.610 --> 15:13.947
to curtail
his Cuban cigar habit.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.515
Merri?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.451
Daniel, you're supposed

15:18.485 --> 15:19.652
to be on assignment.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.955
Yeah, yeah, I just,
I just heard about Evan,

15:21.989 --> 15:24.191
so I came right back.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.625
It's good to see you.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.227
Yeah, it's...

15:32.065 --> 15:34.667
Why don't I go find Dad?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.673
Ooh, wow, I, uh,

15:40.707 --> 15:43.510
haven't seen you
since the, uh--

15:43.543 --> 15:44.611
The funeral.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.546
Yeah.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.181
How you been?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.984
Uh, you know, not bad.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.685
You?

15:52.719 --> 15:55.688
Yeah.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.592
So, uh, I assume
that you're, uh,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.461
you're here for work.
Yes.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.629
Right, well,
let's talk about that.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.231
How can I help?

16:04.264 --> 16:06.566
Okay, uh, Jared Zorn.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.268
Mm-hmm.
What do you know
about him?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.470
Did he ever make
any threats to Evan?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.772
I doubt that
he'd single Evan out.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.742
The team works these
pieces together.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.577
Although, Zorn is facing

16:17.610 --> 16:20.313
federal prosecution
because of us.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.749
We've been trying to bring
this bastard down for ten years.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.185
"Ten years"?
Mm-hmm.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.786
Emily didn't work on it,
did she?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.255
Emily?

16:28.288 --> 16:29.656
No.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.159
That wasn't
a Forefront story then.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.760
Why do you ask?

16:33.793 --> 16:36.696
It's possible

16:36.729 --> 16:40.033
that Evan and Emily's deaths

16:40.067 --> 16:42.169
are connected.

16:42.202 --> 16:45.138
What are you talking about?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.474
Emily was killed
by a drunk driver.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.542
The guy plead guilty.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.145
It might not be that simple.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.680
LASALLE:
Hey, Brody.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.582
How was Houston?
Promising.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.117
What you guys find?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.552
Well, Patton ran the GPS
on Babish's car.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.588
Now, in the two days
he was in town,

17:01.621 --> 17:04.057
he went to the same house
five times.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.093
Including the night
he died.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.428
SONJA: Now, we went
over there ourselves.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.830
The owner wasn't there, but we
noticed a spiked metal fence.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.133
And we found
dried blood on it.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.701
So now we're thinking that

17:14.734 --> 17:16.469
Babish wasn't there
for a friendly visit.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.138
The housekeeper
gave us security footage

17:18.171 --> 17:20.740
on the night Babish died.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.610
We think that's
Warrant Officer Babish.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.445
And that

17:25.478 --> 17:28.615
here...
is the owner of the house

17:28.648 --> 17:31.284
Jared Zorn, who is now

17:31.318 --> 17:32.852
MIA.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.622
Babish wrote an exposé on Zorn.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.490
PRIDE:
Which gives Zorn

17:37.524 --> 17:40.260
motive to kill Babish
in retaliation.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.329
And no motive
to kill my sister because

17:42.362 --> 17:44.764
Zorn and Emily had nothing
to do with each other.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.635
So I am back to square one.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.749
Everything good?

18:03.783 --> 18:06.186
Jared Zorn... where we at?

18:06.219 --> 18:08.288
Got the BOLO out.
Nothing popping.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.623
Maybe we should put
one out on Brody, too.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.559
Haven't seen her yet
this morning.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.494
Yeah, I tried calling--
voicemail.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.229
Yeah, well, once you get
your hopes up that high,

18:16.263 --> 18:18.798
coming down isn't an easy thing.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.667
That's why I gave her
the morning off.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.335
Well, what can we do?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.337
We let her know that we care,

18:24.371 --> 18:25.438
that we're there for her.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.140
All you can do.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.177
Meantime, we got lots
of questions to answer.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.744
Looking like Zorn
might've killed Babish

18:31.778 --> 18:33.513
for writing that story.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.583
But why would Babish
go to Zorn's house?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.285
Ask and you shall receive.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.621
Okay, footage had
a whole lot of stink on it.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.324
But with a little
bit of Irish luck,

18:44.357 --> 18:46.359
I cleaned it right on up.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.296
Seems that Babish broke in
to get his hands on that laptop.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.431
But the story on Zorn
was already published.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.699
The damage was done.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.235
Why would Babish
still want Zorn's laptop?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.536
Yeah, we're missing
a big piece here.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.339
We find that laptop,
we find our answers.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.409
I'll get a warrant
to search Zorn's house.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.444
What if Babish got away with it?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.614
Well, you two go and search
his family house in Lafitte.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.416
Likely Babish was staying there.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.451
Work, P.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.457
WADE:
Love what you've done
with the place.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.293
It's a work in progress.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.528
You want some tea?

19:21.561 --> 19:24.431
That's why you're
my favorite tenant.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.442
Ah, now that girl
looks like she was fun.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.810
Yeah, she was.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.412
I was always the shy twin.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.414
And she brought me
out of my shell.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.482
Uh-huh.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.584
Even after all
these years, I...

19:44.617 --> 19:47.420
I still feel lost without her.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.390
Oh, that's a dark place to be.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.527
Pride sent you,
didn't he?

19:58.631 --> 20:02.502
I felt like I was this close
to finding the truth,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.572
and I just, I can't...

20:05.605 --> 20:09.276
I-I don't know
how to move on.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.844
You know...

20:11.878 --> 20:15.382
some folks say
whatever doesn't kill us

20:15.415 --> 20:17.984
makes us stronger.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.686
What they should say is
whatever doesn't kill us

20:19.719 --> 20:22.389
can make us stronger

20:22.422 --> 20:23.756
if we let it.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.593
If only it were that easy.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.529
You say, "I will move on,

20:29.562 --> 20:32.999
because my life matters, too."

20:34.401 --> 20:36.536
But only you can do that.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.676
Is everything okay?

20:43.710 --> 20:44.944
Yeah.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.414
Just old friend in town.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.516
Oh.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.054
Hey.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.290
What are you doing here?

20:57.324 --> 20:59.492
I needed to talk to you.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.428
What you told
me yesterday,

21:01.461 --> 21:04.297
it kept me up
most of the night.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.299
I shouldn't have told you.
I'm sorry.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.700
I-I didn't, I didn't
mean to upset you.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.569
Yeah, I'm sure
that you didn't.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.438
But now I just can't
stop thinking about it.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.072
I'm sorry, Daniel.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.074
I don't need you to be sorry.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.411
But I do need you to stop
looking into Emily's death.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.648
You came all the way
from Houston to tell me this?

21:21.681 --> 21:23.583
You're Emily's sister, okay?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.885
And I care about you.
I'm worried about you.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.954
And I know
what it's like

21:27.987 --> 21:29.489
more than anyone
to be stuck in the past.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.957
But this is not healthy.

21:30.990 --> 21:31.991
You got to let it go.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.926
"Let it go"?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.528
Emily may have been murdered.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.430
How can you brush that off?

21:37.464 --> 21:39.499
Merri, you're looking for
answers that just aren't there.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.700
Okay?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.671
I can't dwell
on this anymore.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.441
I'm getting married.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.444
Congratulations.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.045
Oh, don't-don't be like that.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.481
No, you know what?
I am so glad

21:54.514 --> 21:56.583
you're able to put
Emily behind you.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.618
You won't hear from me again.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.622
Have a safe trip
back to Houston.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.364
LASALLE: I was thinking we could
do something for Brody.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.899
You know, cheer her up?

22:12.932 --> 22:15.635
Yeah, I don't think a pizza
party's gonna do the trick.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.404
Well, could raise
the bar a little higher.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.771
Look, I don't think
there's a bar high enough

22:18.805 --> 22:20.072
for what she's
going through.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.774
It's just gonna
take some time.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.376
Hey.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.511
I thought no one was

22:24.544 --> 22:25.945
supposed to be living here.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.084
NCIS.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.654
Federal agents.

22:40.993 --> 22:41.928
Clear.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.963
Clear.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.939
Ah, looks like the Babish family
needs a new interior decorator.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.543
Eh, more like Jared Zorn was
here looking for his laptop.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.545
Well, if it was here,
it's gone now.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.049
Patton, tell me
some good news.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.553
Why you think
they keep me around?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.688
I went deep diving through
Zorn's credit card history.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.990
Turns out, he bought
his laptop six months ago.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.961
And that particular bad boy has
built-in geo-location software.

23:14.994 --> 23:18.164
And I tracked it right
to Babish's pad in Lafitte.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.866
SONJA:
Yeah, I don't think so, buddy.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.435
We're in said pad,
and it ain't here.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.807
That's the pinging
locator sound.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.677
The rest should be
self-explanatory.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.445
Sounds like it's
in the chimney.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.880
You want me to come
down there and get it?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.549
Or maybe you don't
need me to do everything?

23:36.583 --> 23:39.018
Hold your taters, Patton.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.592
B-I...

23:45.625 --> 23:47.894
N-G-O.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.998
LASALLE:
You're a genius, Patton.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.800
SEBASTIAN:
So, Lasalle and Sonja

23:53.833 --> 23:55.167
just brought
the laptop back.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.569
Did you get anything off it?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.705
No, I just started
a diagnostic on it.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.006
Patton went to go
get us some snacks.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.608
That usually helps.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.646
You know that someone
sent you those photos

24:06.679 --> 24:08.715
for a reason, right?

24:08.748 --> 24:11.718
Your sister's death wasn't
just about Edward Lamb.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.252
For whatever it's worth,

24:13.285 --> 24:15.722
I... I still believe.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.160
That means a lot.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.095
: Uh, yeah,
you know, it's, uh...

24:23.129 --> 24:25.131
it ain't no thing.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.668
Dude, what the hell is going on?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.770
I don't know, man-- all
I did was put it online.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.138
Something's funky.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.606
Yeah, well, it ain't

24:33.640 --> 24:35.007
just Brody kissing you.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.676
Dude, your laptop
is being hacked.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.210
Hacked? What are
they looking for?

24:38.244 --> 24:40.212
PATTON: Well, it's unclear,
but they haven't gotten

24:40.246 --> 24:42.649
through the firewalls yet,
so maybe we can trace

24:42.682 --> 24:45.084
who's doing it.
All right,
let me know what you find.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.254
So, this is really strange.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.857
Someone's trying to hack
into Zorn's laptop.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.592
Right now?
Yeah.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.926
Any idea who?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.862
Patton and Sebastian
are looking into it.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.564
They don't have
anything yet.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.799
Okay, well, I got something
pretty strange, too.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.301
BOLO on Zorn came back.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.736
He's dead.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.805
What

25:05.838 --> 25:08.641
Zorn was crossing the road,
vehicle ran into him.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.809
NOPD got the call.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.744
They think it's an accident.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.245
Okay, another person
accidentally killed

25:13.279 --> 25:15.047
by a vehicle?
I don't think so.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.317
Yeah. Lasalle and Sonja are
meeting Wade at the crime scene.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.087
If there's foul play,
we'll find out.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.690
Okay, so Zorn catches Babish
stealing his laptop.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.792
Babish ends up dead
that same night.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.294
Then Zorn tries to get
the laptop back,

25:28.327 --> 25:30.262
fails, ends up dead, too?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.264
Now third person's
trying to hack in.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.266
What's on that laptop?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.268
And how is this hacker involved?

25:36.302 --> 25:37.737
Well, now you can ask him.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.672
So, I traced
the hacker's IP address,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.273
connected it to a physical
address in Baton Rouge.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.909
I'm texting it to you guys
right now.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.712
All right, let's go.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.247
PRIDE:
NCIS!

25:48.280 --> 25:49.716
Federal agents!

25:56.255 --> 25:58.791
*

26:07.967 --> 26:09.201
NCIS.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.905
Put your hands
where I can see them.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.275
Show 'em to me.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.180
Easy.
Okay, okay, okay.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.782
Easy, hands out.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.852
Oh, my God.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.855
Edward Lamb.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.826
He's the one
who killed my sister.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.774
Percy, you see this now,
don't you?

26:47.807 --> 26:49.976
Emily and Babish's cases
have to be connected.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.278
Lamb killed my sister,
then he hacked into the laptop

26:52.311 --> 26:54.847
that Babish stole--
now, what else could that mean?

26:54.881 --> 26:56.315
Yeah, I don't
disagree with you.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.917
There is a connection.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.285
Lamb murdered my sister.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.688
I am betting he killed
Babish and Zorn, too.

27:01.721 --> 27:02.855
Maybe, but that's

27:02.889 --> 27:04.156
a big leap.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.092
This is what we know.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.127
Lamb was released from prison
six months ago.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.862
Living off the grid
ever since.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.263
Psych evals are normal.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.166
And he was an I.T. dude,
which explains the hacking.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.868
But that's all we got.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.203
That's not all.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.239
Patton scanned
Lamb's computers,

27:20.272 --> 27:22.709
found something that I think
you're gonna want to see.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.279
Photos.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.182
Lamb sent me the photos.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.818
Why the hell would he do that?

27:31.851 --> 27:34.186
I got to talk to him.
Brody.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.289
Remember what we spoke about?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.291
About you going down a
rabbit hole-- you're down there.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.361
And I got to be frank--
I don't trust your judgment.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.932
You may not trust me,
but I have been right all along.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.200
I said there was a connection,
and there is.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.236
So please,
don't shut me out right now.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.971
Look, Tie may need to go

27:52.004 --> 27:53.906
to the runner on
this one, King.

27:53.940 --> 27:57.443
Lamb says...
he's got to talk to Brody.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.082
I know you hate me.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.217
I understand.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.386
My sister is dead
because of you.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.756
No, she isn't.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.224
I did not kill her.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.800
This is a one-month
sobriety coin.

28:20.833 --> 28:24.904
I got it at an AA meeting
the night Emily died.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.906
I swear to you...

28:26.939 --> 28:29.809
I never would have had a drink
that night.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.410
We're supposed to believe that?

28:31.443 --> 28:34.113
You pled guilty,
Edward.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.082
Now we're supposed to...

28:36.115 --> 28:40.186
believe you were framed?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.154
If there was any chance
I thought someone

28:42.188 --> 28:44.991
would've believed me, I wouldn't
have taken the plea bargain.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.325
But yes, yes,

28:46.358 --> 28:48.961
I think I was drugged.
I was knocked out.

28:50.396 --> 28:54.934
Someone else ran over
your sister, and I was put

28:54.967 --> 28:56.869
in the driver's seat.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.305
Why choose you to be the patsy?

28:59.338 --> 29:02.474
Because I was an alcoholic
with an old DUI.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.510
An easy target? I don't know.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.313
All that matters now
is clearing my name.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.949
That's all I have left.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.851
I have to prove it.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.252
I have to.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.222
That's why you sent me
those photos.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.224
So I'd prove it for you.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.391
But you didn't
find anything.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.127
I had to take
it on myself,

29:21.160 --> 29:22.161
do my own investigating.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.830
What have you found?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.233
Mostly I've been grasping
at straws.

29:27.266 --> 29:31.003
But I thought maybe Emily's
death was related to her work.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.140
So when Evan Babish died,

29:34.173 --> 29:36.042
i-it got me thinking.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.345
Babish worked at the same paper
on the same team.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.314
And both deaths were made
to look accidental.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.083
I thought the exact
same thing, too--

29:44.116 --> 29:46.152
that whoever killed Emily
killed Babish, too.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.387
LAMB:
And if I find who killed Babish,

29:48.420 --> 29:51.123
I find who did this to me.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.326
That's why you hacked
Zorn's laptop?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.828
Of course.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.064
Babish published
that story about Zorn.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.199
I thought maybe
he was responsible.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.434
I was looking for proof.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.238
SONJA: You think
he's telling the truth?

30:06.272 --> 30:08.007
He served his time--

30:08.040 --> 30:09.575
why would he be doing all this
if he wasn't innocent,

30:09.608 --> 30:11.310
if he wasn't looking
for who framed him?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.012
So everyone thinks
the same person's

30:13.045 --> 30:14.313
behind all these murders.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.248
Now all we need
to do is find evidence

30:16.282 --> 30:17.984
proving the connection.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.618
Well, we might be able
to help you with that.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.021
We just ran
Jared Zorn's blood work,

30:22.054 --> 30:23.555
and surprise, surprise--

30:23.589 --> 30:25.925
he also had elevated
blood alcohol levels,

30:25.958 --> 30:27.293
just like Babish.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.028
SEBASTIAN: Which made us wonder
if someone

30:29.061 --> 30:30.429
was trying
to make them look like drunks

30:30.462 --> 30:31.998
who couldn't notice
oncoming vehicles.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.399
Which would be pretty smart

30:33.432 --> 30:35.334
considering how often
coroners close their books

30:35.367 --> 30:37.970
when alcohol rears its head.
Yeah, so we dug

30:38.004 --> 30:39.438
a little deeper,
and it turns out

30:39.471 --> 30:41.640
that both Babish
and Zorn were drugged.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.277
Alprazolam-- it's a medication
that when combined with alcohol

30:45.311 --> 30:47.346
drastically increases
intoxication levels.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.216
And as I was digging deeper,
I went even further back--

30:50.249 --> 30:52.184
to Edward Lamb's blood work.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.585
He, too, was drugged.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.587
Alprazolam every time.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.057
My guess--
they were all injected

30:58.090 --> 31:00.592
with an alprazolam-alcohol
cocktail.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.494
This is the proof.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.430
So it is the same killer.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.232
Yeah. Which is a nice way
of saying,

31:06.265 --> 31:09.301
"Boom, we told you so. What?
Bro-astian for the win."

31:11.303 --> 31:13.039
That's "Brody" and
"Sebastian" combined.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.073
You just...

31:14.106 --> 31:16.142
We're done here.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.377
Sounds like our killer has
a very specific M.O.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.546
Could be a pro.
Well, if he's struck before,

31:20.579 --> 31:22.915
there may be a record of it.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.985
All right, you two start
with the NCIC database.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.319
Hey,

31:27.353 --> 31:28.454
we're almost there, Mer.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.621
Almost there.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.290
And I'm about
to get you closer.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.592
If Mr. Lamb knew how
to hack into this puppy,

31:33.625 --> 31:35.427
he'd have found
something interesting.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.696
Turns out someone put
remote-monitoring software

31:37.729 --> 31:39.431
on Zorn's laptop.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.167
Otherwise known as a bug.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.701
So someone was spying on Zorn?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.236
Oh, and here's the kicker.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.972
All the information
on the laptop

31:46.005 --> 31:49.408
was being transmitted to
a server at the Houston Globe.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.477
I would love to tell you
who was receiving it,

31:51.510 --> 31:53.512
but too many firewalls
on their service.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.047
Impossible to track.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.950
Come on.
We're going back to Houston.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.221
Look... I don't know
anything about it.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.623
Come on, you're the I.T. guy--
if anyone knows

32:04.656 --> 32:06.625
what's going through
those servers, it's you.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.527
Here's what we know,
Jessica.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.429
Your ex-boyfriend,

32:10.462 --> 32:12.398
who you spoke to
right before he died,

32:12.431 --> 32:15.434
stole that laptop
from Jared Zorn's house.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.703
Now we know it was bugged
and sending information

32:17.736 --> 32:19.505
through your servers.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.573
So forgive us
if it's hard to believe

32:21.607 --> 32:23.575
that you don't know anything.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.445
Look, we know
you're hiding something.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.980
What is it?

32:40.259 --> 32:44.030
Sorry. I just don't know
who's listening to me in there.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.334
I did lie before...

32:48.367 --> 32:50.402
about what Evan and I
talked about on the phone.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.105
I'm just... I'm scared.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.207
Jessica, we can protect you.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.544
Evan told me

32:58.577 --> 33:00.446
he stole
Zorn's laptop.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.414
He wanted to prove
their lies.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.416
That story on Zorn...

33:04.450 --> 33:07.353
Evan had him working on it
for months,

33:07.386 --> 33:08.520
and then it died.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.789
Evan couldn't find
the smoking gun.

33:10.822 --> 33:15.561
And then suddenly Forefront
had all these files

33:15.594 --> 33:17.463
proving Zorn's guilt,

33:17.496 --> 33:19.331
all from anonymous sources--
no one could say

33:19.365 --> 33:21.233
where they were from.
They got the files

33:21.267 --> 33:22.468
from the bug.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.570
That's what
Evan wanted to prove.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.574
Did Evan know who was behind it?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.242
Of course.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.478
Who's in charge of Forefront?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.580
Who ran the story?

33:34.613 --> 33:36.415
Whose family loses
their business

33:36.448 --> 33:38.350
if we don't keep
people reading?

33:38.384 --> 33:40.252
Daniel Nolan.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.624
Daniel knew Evan
was onto him.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.627
:
He did it.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.729
:
Excuse me.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.502
This makes so much sense now.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.605
Daniel wanted me
to drop the case.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.609
I... I hadn't thought
about this until just now,

34:03.642 --> 34:05.477
but right before Emily died,
Forefront ran

34:05.511 --> 34:07.513
the State House
corruption piece.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.714
The story was dead.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.349
And somehow
it came back to life.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.650
Which means Emily knew

34:11.683 --> 34:13.319
about the bugging.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.621
:
Pride...

34:15.654 --> 34:17.523
please don't tell me
he killed her.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.161
Yeah, Chris?

34:22.194 --> 34:24.830
We got a pop
in the NCIC database.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.532
Same M.O. as our killer.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.634
SONJA:
A dude named Martin Gorman.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.603
Private investigator with a
background in military security.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.505
LASALLE:
Yeah, in 2002

34:33.539 --> 34:36.742
and 2006 he was unsuccessfully
tried for murders.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.745
Both victims had alprazolam
in their system.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.348
And we got Gorman's addy.
We're on the way.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.251
I think we got an idea
who might've hired him.

34:45.284 --> 34:49.588
When you find him, ask him if
he knows the name Daniel Nolan.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.092
*

35:01.267 --> 35:04.303
Martin Gorman! NCIS!
Open up!

35:06.638 --> 35:08.607
Son of a bitch!

35:12.311 --> 35:14.112
*

35:16.582 --> 35:19.151
This is as fast as you can go?
No, ma'am.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.659
*

36:01.660 --> 36:03.695
Hey, he's like
the Energizer Bunny.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.830
I'll cut him off.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.932
*

36:14.706 --> 36:17.209
How you doing, Mr. Gorman?

36:17.243 --> 36:19.578
Yeah. That sounds about right.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.927
Step out, my man.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.930
You got a lot of explaining
to do, Mr. Gorman.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.433
That might be the understatement
of the century.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.969
Three murders in eight years--
it'd take all week.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.338
: You got
two things on me--

36:46.372 --> 36:47.839
jack and squat.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.609
We do have two things, actually.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.977
Yeah, bugging software
and alprazolam

36:52.010 --> 36:53.445
found in your house.

36:53.479 --> 36:56.014
Now, I wonder what
you could use those for.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.484
I think he would use it
to drug Edward Lamb

36:58.517 --> 37:00.686
and frame him
for Emily Brody's murder.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.621
And then he took care
of Evan Babish,

37:02.654 --> 37:05.457
and last
but certainly not least,

37:05.491 --> 37:06.492
Jared Zorn.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.527
And after Babish
stole his laptop,

37:08.560 --> 37:09.861
he couldn't risk Zorn

37:09.895 --> 37:11.563
finding out
what was on it, could he?

37:11.597 --> 37:12.731
Mm-hmm.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.367
I want a lawyer.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.868
Oh, you'll get your lawyer.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.870
But he's not saving you
from the death penalty.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.874
No, sir. See, we got you for
murders in Louisiana and Texas.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.343
Best way you can help yourself

37:24.376 --> 37:27.379
is if you tell us
who you're working for.

37:27.413 --> 37:31.016
Now, the name Daniel Nolan,
does that ring a bell?

37:39.425 --> 37:40.792
Daniel.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.428
Merri. Hey.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.631
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

37:45.664 --> 37:46.898
Robert Nolan...

37:46.932 --> 37:48.834
you are under arrest.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.337
Under arrest?

37:51.370 --> 37:52.604
What are you talking about?

37:52.638 --> 37:53.905
We're talking

37:53.939 --> 37:55.974
about Martin Gorman,
the man you hired

37:56.007 --> 37:59.611
to kill three people,
including Babish and Emily.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.681
Wh... Come on, this is crazy.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.383
No, it's not, actually.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.352
These murders were
all part of a cover-up

38:06.385 --> 38:08.520
so your father
could steal information

38:08.554 --> 38:09.655
for Forefront.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.357
No, that's not true.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.691
You're lying.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.326
I know it's hard to hear,

38:14.360 --> 38:15.994
but it doesn't make it
any less true.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.930
Who got you the files on Zorn
after the piece went dead?

38:18.964 --> 38:20.699
Ask your father where
he got the information.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.802
If you think I'm lying...

38:23.835 --> 38:25.303
ask him.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.675
Dad?

38:31.643 --> 38:34.346
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.947
What?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.383
BRODY:
Get hurt?

38:37.416 --> 38:40.085
You had my sister killed.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.553
How could you?

38:41.587 --> 38:43.789
No, no, Merideth,
i-it wasn't that...

38:43.822 --> 38:45.624
Don't make this harder
than it already is.
Wait, wait, Dad,

38:45.657 --> 38:46.758
It's over.
what are you doing!

38:46.792 --> 38:48.727
No!

38:49.961 --> 38:53.432
Those stories...
they had to be told.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.867
The truth had to come out.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.470
The truth

38:58.504 --> 39:01.740
You just did this so you
could save your precious paper!

39:01.773 --> 39:04.643
I did it
to save your future.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.446
Emily was my future!

39:12.451 --> 39:13.652
PRIDE:
Robert...

39:13.685 --> 39:16.121
this is not the answer.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.456
It won't solve anything.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.958
Actually, it might
make things worse.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.927
Maybe not for you,
but for Daniel,

39:21.960 --> 39:23.395
for Nancy.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.567
They'll never have
their questions answered.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.836
They will always be...

39:30.869 --> 39:33.138
longing...

39:33.171 --> 39:35.006
hurting...

39:35.040 --> 39:36.642
wondering.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.745
They deserve closure,

39:39.778 --> 39:41.747
Robert.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.982
And we deserve
justice.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.887
Don't deny us that.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.123
Robert...

39:52.157 --> 39:54.660
it's the least you can do.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.801
*

40:23.522 --> 40:26.858
*

40:29.094 --> 40:30.996
Happy St. Patty's.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.700
*

40:34.733 --> 40:36.468
Hey.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.871
There you are.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.973
No stew?

40:42.007 --> 40:44.142
I'm sure the recipe

40:44.175 --> 40:46.177
is in one of my boxes.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.748
How you doing?

40:49.781 --> 40:52.918
So, we got to the truth
of it all, but...

40:52.951 --> 40:55.120
I still feel this...

40:55.153 --> 40:57.823
hole in my heart...

40:57.856 --> 41:00.058
and it's...

41:00.091 --> 41:02.728
it's just as big
as it was before.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.630
:
Yeah.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.533
You just got to take it
one day at a time.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.568
One box at a time.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.672
It's okay to start
living your life again.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.776
You got the strength.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.779
And I'm proud of you.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.247
*

41:22.280 --> 41:24.550
Emily would be proud, too.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.787
Thanks.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.822
Come on.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.824
Come inside.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.628
Thank you, Pride.
Sure.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.198
Ah. But I'm not the only one

41:40.231 --> 41:42.968
who has to take it
one day at a time.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.539
*

41:47.573 --> 41:49.741
Hi. Uh, I'm Edward.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.610
I'm an alcoholic,

41:51.643 --> 41:53.912
and I have recently celebrated
my eighth birthday.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.981
OTHERS:
Hi, Edward.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.019
Uh... these last few years

42:01.052 --> 42:03.622
have not been easy.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.256
For a long time, uh,

42:05.290 --> 42:08.293
people thought the
wrong thing about me.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.565
But, uh...

42:13.599 --> 42:15.133
*

42:16.835 --> 42:18.637
...I think...

42:18.670 --> 42:21.573
finally, my-my life's
starting to turn a corner.
