WEBVTT

00:10.214 --> 00:12.405
Hey, Daphne! You seen Eddie?

00:12.405 --> 00:13.636
No, I haven't.

00:13.636 --> 00:16.771
It just doesn't feel right to start
the day without him licking me awake.

00:16.771 --> 00:20.775
Well, don't look at me.

00:20.775 --> 00:23.059
Morning, all. Daphne, I got treats!

00:23.059 --> 00:24.442
What the hell are you doing with him?

00:24.442 --> 00:25.642
We went for a walk.

00:25.642 --> 00:33.749
I'm talking to Eddie.

00:33.749 --> 00:36.213
When I saw what a beautiful day it was,
I headed for the park.

00:36.213 --> 00:38.140
Of course, the only people in the park
at this hour of the morning without dogs

00:38.140 --> 00:44.831
are winos and that guy in the harem pants that washes 
his hair in the fountain. He says hello, by the way.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.695
It is sort of nice out, isn't it?

00:46.695 --> 00:47.734
Sort of nice? My God,

00:47.734 --> 00:48.971
haven't you people noticed this?

00:48.971 --> 00:51.550
It's incredible! Dad, you should feel this.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.613
It's eighty degrees outside 
and it's the middle of February!

00:54.613 --> 01:00.930
Oh, it is beautiful, and in the middle of such a
terrible winter. Oh, I love nature's little

01:00.930 --> 01:08.110
aberrations: warm days in winter,
four leaf clovers, Australians...

01:08.110 --> 01:09.071
Yes, it is glorious.

01:09.071 --> 01:12.126
It defies you not to takea moment to
acknowledge the power that created it.

01:12.126 --> 01:17.511
Thank you, global warming!

01:17.511 --> 01:21.782
Hey Frasier, think your guy down at the liquor store 
could send a bottle of Scotch to my buddy Jimmy in Montana?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.449
Sure, Dad.  What's the occasion?

01:23.449 --> 01:25.063
Today's his sixteenth birthday.

01:25.063 --> 01:29.086
Oh well, you'll want to throw in a hooker too, 
won't you?

01:29.086 --> 01:30.830
No, don't you get it? It's February 29th.

01:30.830 --> 01:31.734
Hmm.

01:31.734 --> 01:32.575
It's a leap year.

01:32.575 --> 01:33.117
Right.

01:33.117 --> 01:34.230
He only gets a birthday every four years.

01:34.230 --> 01:35.016
I get it dad. 

01:35.016 --> 01:35.769
He's really sixty-four.
I can do the math.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.897
Jimmy's having a big shindig tonight.

01:40.897 --> 01:43.153
A lot of guys from the force fly in for it. 

01:43.153 --> 01:49.378
Everybody drinks a lot of beer, and then they
have a contest to see who's got the biggest scar.

01:49.378 --> 01:58.408
You know, this year I had a real good chance of winning 
it now that "Shark Bait" O'Reilly's finally died.

01:58.408 --> 02:00.542
So, why aren't you going?

02:00.542 --> 02:01.682
Yeah Dad, you should go.

02:01.682 --> 02:03.487
Ah, Montana's too far away.

02:03.487 --> 02:06.502
Well Dad, his birthday only comes 
around once every four years.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.389
As a matter of fact, this day only comes
around every four years.

02:09.389 --> 02:12.918
You know, it's like a free day, a gift.

02:12.918 --> 02:14.800
We should do something special, be bold!

02:14.800 --> 02:16.858
It's leap year, take a leap!
(leap year - leap)

02:16.858 --> 02:20.360
You know, I was just about to say 
the same thing to you.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.426
Your son's right.

02:24.426 --> 02:27.017
You shouldn't be afraid to shake up 
your routine a little bit.

02:27.017 --> 02:29.585
Hey, I don't see you taking any big leaps today.

02:29.585 --> 02:32.268
If there was something I wanted to do, 
I would do it.

02:32.268 --> 02:34.576
Well, you're always whining about wanting 
to change your hair.

02:34.576 --> 02:37.770
[whining] I don't whine!

02:37.770 --> 02:40.559
"I'm so sick of me hair.

02:40.559 --> 02:43.850
Do you think I should get it cut like Princess Di?

02:43.850 --> 02:46.951
Ooh, do you think that'd make me cheeks 
look too fat?

02:46.951 --> 02:52.890
That reminds me of the craziest thing me 
Grammy Moon used to say!"

02:52.890 --> 02:56.346
I'll pay for the damn haircut if you stop yakking 
and just do it.

02:56.346 --> 02:59.432
Yes, well I'll pay for you to go to Montana.

02:59.432 --> 03:02.095
That's not the one next to New Hampshire, is it?

03:02.095 --> 03:04.327
No. And Dad can pay for his own trip.

03:04.327 --> 03:07.123
All right, then.  
And I can pay for me own haircut.

03:07.123 --> 03:08.632
All right, Dad, back in your court.

03:08.632 --> 03:11.299
Are you up to the leap year challenge?

03:11.299 --> 03:12.971
Ah.....

03:12.971 --> 03:20.144
Dad, Jimmy's already sixteen.
How many more birthdays is he going to have?

03:20.144 --> 03:25.000
You know, I would kind of hate not being there 
when Jimmy brings out the big ham.

03:28.465 --> 03:30.752
Oh, all right, what the hell, I'll go.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.423
I'll call the airlines after breakfast.

03:31.423 --> 03:32.992
That's the spirit!

03:32.992 --> 03:35.007
Hey, what's your big leap year challenge?

03:35.007 --> 03:35.928
Well, have you forgotten?

03:35.928 --> 03:38.543
I'm singing "Buttons and Bows" tonight at the 
P.B.S. pledge drive.

03:38.543 --> 03:41.048
You sung that same stupid song for 
the last three years.

03:41.048 --> 03:44.385
Yes, but I'm doing something remarkably fresh 
and different with it this year!

03:44.385 --> 03:45.568
You're just blowing smoke, aren't you?

03:45.568 --> 03:48.034
Like a '56 Rambler!

03:48.034 --> 03:49.120
Good morning, Niles!

03:49.120 --> 03:51.472
Good?  It's glorious, heaven-sent!

03:51.472 --> 03:56.038
And you know why? Maris called! She wants
to get together with me this evening.

03:56.038 --> 03:57.208
Oh Niles, that's wonderful news!

03:57.208 --> 03:59.705
It's high time you and Maris sat down 
and talked through your problems.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.118
She doesn't want to talk.

04:01.118 --> 04:04.223
When she says "get together" she means in the 
"You wear the creme fraiche,

04:04.223 --> 04:08.465
I'll lick it off" sense.

04:08.465 --> 04:14.756
She's cleared her schedule from 19:00 till 19:30, 
that means foreplay AND cuddling!

04:14.756 --> 04:18.875
You know, Niles, remember when you were a kid and 
your mother and I wouldn't discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis

04:18.875 --> 04:21.041
in front of you because we knew 
it'd give you bad dreams?

04:21.041 --> 04:22.305
Yes.

04:22.305 --> 04:30.311
It's a two-way street.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.217
Breakfast, Dr. Crane?

04:31.217 --> 04:32.759
Uh yes, thank you, Daphne.

04:32.759 --> 04:36.290
Niles, I don't mind telling you, 
I'm a little bit concerned about this.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.475
Maris claps her hands, you come running?

04:38.475 --> 04:42.065
Oh well, don't forget there's a little something 
for me in this too.

04:42.065 --> 04:43.809
I haven't had sex in six months.

04:43.809 --> 04:46.180
Oh, surely you're exaggerating, 
you've only been separated for three.

04:46.180 --> 04:55.093
And your point would be?

04:55.093 --> 04:58.299
You really want to sacrifice your self-respect 
for a roll in the hay?

04:58.299 --> 05:04.423
Substitute a 16th-century giltwood fainting couch 
for hay and watch me roll!

05:04.423 --> 05:07.482
Niles, you and Maris have not sat down 
and discussed your problems.

05:07.482 --> 05:10.306
As a psychiatrist you know that sex 
will only cloud the issues.

05:10.306 --> 05:13.056
You don't realize how desperate I am.

05:13.056 --> 05:18.643
Ever since our separation, 
I've been paying women to touch me.

05:18.643 --> 05:19.433
Oh, Niles...

05:19.433 --> 05:24.217
Manicurists, pedicurists, facialists.

05:24.217 --> 05:32.314
Whenever you see a man who's well-groomed, 
you can bet he's not getting any.

05:32.314 --> 05:33.891
Well, will you at least think about what 
I've said?

05:33.891 --> 05:38.804
I can't. She's leaving for Europe in the morning, 
so I have a very small window of opportunity.

05:38.804 --> 05:41.576
Niles... you know I'm right.

05:41.576 --> 05:43.682
You just don't want me to have sex 
because you're not having any!

05:43.682 --> 05:46.450
I most certainly am too!

05:46.450 --> 06:04.514
Your lips say yes, 
but your cuticles speak volumes.

06:04.514 --> 06:05.643
Niles...

06:05.643 --> 06:10.714
Oh, you're right. I'll tell her no.

06:10.714 --> 06:12.467
It's not going to be easy, though.

06:12.467 --> 06:15.539
Of course not. Just don't think about sex.

06:15.539 --> 06:19.300
Would you like me to butter your buns for you, 
Dr. Crane?

06:25.300 --> 06:29.000
Grandma in a teddy.

06:30.091 --> 06:35.242
Thank you.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.249
You're all mine in buttons and bows!

06:43.249 --> 06:45.961
Oh God, it must be P.B.S. pledge time again.

06:45.961 --> 06:48.740
Roz, it is a wonderful day.

06:48.740 --> 06:52.645
You know, I think the entire city of Seattle 
is convinced it's springtime.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.189
I was walking down the street, I passed a pet store,

06:55.189 --> 06:59.285
and in the window I could see two snakes 
doing a mating dance.

06:59.285 --> 07:08.875
If you ask me, celebrating a dance that brings more snakes 
into the world is like toasting a law school graduation.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.019
Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done 
nothing to improve your mood.

07:12.019 --> 07:15.347
Well, how would you feel if you just lost the love 
of your life?

07:15.347 --> 07:19.578
Well, alimony aside, I found it rather liberating.

07:19.578 --> 07:22.862
My car wouldn't start, so I had to take the bus.

07:22.862 --> 07:27.534
And we're all crowded on there, when suddenly 
I smell Lagerfeld, and I... 

07:27.534 --> 07:30.781
I look up, and there he is.

07:30.781 --> 07:34.181
Carl Lagerfeld?

07:34.181 --> 07:37.638
His name is Gary. I don't know his last name.  

07:37.638 --> 07:40.427
Anyway, we got to talking, and you know, 
we were really connecting.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.595
I started to believe in kismet.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.887
And all of a sudden, all these people want to get off 
the bus, and I'm in their way, so I get off

07:45.887 --> 07:50.829
to let them out, and before I can get back on, 
the damn bus drives off...! Out of my life, forever.

07:50.829 --> 07:54.045
I'm sure another one would have come along 
in ten minutes or so.

07:54.045 --> 07:55.703
I'm talking about the guy.

07:55.703 --> 07:59.832
So am I.

07:59.832 --> 08:01.199
You don't get it, Frasier. I mean,

08:01.199 --> 08:04.706
I really felt this guy was the one.

08:04.706 --> 08:07.866
Roz, if you really want to try to find him again, 
you know we do reach half a million listeners.

08:07.866 --> 08:10.107
Why don't you just tell your story on the air?

08:10.107 --> 08:14.258
On the air?  Oh, I couldn't do that, 
it would make me look pathetic.

08:14.258 --> 08:16.384
Oh, it's too bizarre, it's too needy.

08:16.384 --> 08:17.136
It's two o'clock.

08:17.136 --> 08:22.975
Oh my God!

08:22.975 --> 08:29.200
A glorious good afternoon, Seattle. This is Dr.F.Crane. 
I'm thinking a lot today about leap year.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.676
Today is February 29th, and although 
it isn't an official holiday,  

08:33.676 --> 08:36.559
perhaps it could be looked upon as one 
in a metaphorical sense.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.688
Just as Christmas reminds us 
to be generous of spirit, 

08:39.688 --> 08:44.232
so leap year reminds us to take 
a leap in our own lives. 

08:44.232 --> 08:46.585
To be bold, try something new.

08:46.585 --> 08:51.264
Too often we shrink from doing 
things we really want to,

08:51.264 --> 08:58.210
held back by... oh, appearing 
foolish, perhaps... Roz?

08:58.210 --> 09:06.594
Is there anything you'd like to say before 
we start taking calls?

09:06.594 --> 09:10.410
No.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.928
I'm reminded of a quotation 
by John Greenleaf Whittier:

09:12.928 --> 09:25.018
"For all sad words of tongue or pen, 
the saddest are these: "It might have been".. Roz?

09:25.018 --> 09:27.443
No.

09:27.443 --> 09:41.177
Did you know that a woman over the age of thirty has less chance 
of getting married than of being killed in a terrorist attack?

09:41.177 --> 09:42.926
This is to Gary.

09:42.926 --> 09:48.644
I was on the Number Seven bus around noon, and you were 
a stockbroker with a tan briefcase 

09:48.644 --> 09:52.893
and a cleft chin, and the bus was really crowded 
and we both reached    

09:52.893 --> 09:56.940
for the hand strap and our hands touched 
and we laughed and ..

09:56.940 --> 09:58.921
.. you said I had a really great laugh 
and I said you had ..

09:58.921 --> 10:02.999
.. a really great laugh and we laughed at that ..

10:02.999 --> 10:08.184
Anyway, uh, you asked me if I were free on Friday, but 
we got separated before I could give you my phone number,

10:08.184 --> 10:14.096
which I would have because I really liked you 
and I thought you were cute.

10:14.096 --> 10:18.197
So Gary, if you're listening, please, 
please give us a call.

10:18.197 --> 10:20.392
We'll be right back after these words.

10:20.392 --> 10:26.500
Oh my God, oh my God! How could I say "I really liked you 
and I thought you were cute"..who am I, Marcia Brady?!

10:29.289 --> 10:36.231
Well, we'll be right back for more calls, 
and more on the search for Gary, after this news break.

10:36.231 --> 10:42.248
Good news! I've figured out a way I can have sex 
and we can all be happy!

10:42.248 --> 10:48.061
As I pause to make sure the 
"ON AIR" light is off, continue.

10:48.061 --> 10:56.309
Well, I was driving down the freeway trying hard not to 
notice the provocative decals truckers have on their mud flaps

10:58.309 --> 11:01.702
when I heard your little speech about breaking out 
of familiar patterns.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.192
Mmm-hmm.

11:02.192 --> 11:06.000
Well, sleeping alone has been my pattern! 
I'm ready to take a leap!

11:06.000 --> 11:07.934
No, you're not.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.897
Okay, not a leap, 
but you've got to give me something. 

11:09.897 --> 11:11.327
A hop, a bound. Gimme a jump, oh God-!

11:11.327 --> 11:15.190
Niles, will you just get a grip!

11:15.190 --> 11:17.487
If you thought being with Maris was the right thing 
to do, you'd be there with her.

11:17.487 --> 11:22.578
You know it's wrong. That's why you're here, 
asking for my permission.

11:22.578 --> 11:24.670
Frasier, Frasier, what if we don't have sex?  
What if we just snuggle?

11:24.670 --> 11:28.288
Whoops, excuse me!

11:28.288 --> 11:31.304
Roz...
I never noticed what a perky little walk you have.

11:31.304 --> 11:41.119
Niles, get back! You just stop that! 
Niles Get control. 

11:41.119 --> 11:45.562
My God, man, there are far more important things 
here than simple immediate physical gratification.

11:45.562 --> 11:51.000
You're right, I...I just have to martial 
my self-discipline and...and be strong.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:08.343 --> 12:09.352
Fifteen seconds.

12:09.352 --> 12:10.201
Oh.

12:10.201 --> 12:11.830
What is wrong with your brother today?

12:11.830 --> 12:12.624
Oh, ignore him.

12:12.624 --> 12:14.751
You know, 
human nature never ceases to amaze me. 

12:14.751 --> 12:18.762
How otherwise rational people can be turned into 
babbling ninnies by their hormones.

12:18.762 --> 12:30.904
OH MY GOD! IT'S GARY! OH MY GOD! IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM!

12:30.904 --> 12:32.363
Well, we're back.

12:32.363 --> 12:35.605
You'll all be glad to know that 
Cupid's arrow has hit its mark.

12:35.605 --> 12:41.518
Gary has just arrived in the hallway, 
and has a big bouquet of flowers for Roz.

12:41.518 --> 12:44.312
You know, the truth is, I'm really quite delighted 
with the way things have turned out today.

12:44.312 --> 12:48.626
It inspires me to take a little leap of my own.

12:48.626 --> 12:54.728
As many of you know, this evening, for the third year 
in a row I will be appearing on the P.B.S. pledge drive...

12:54.728 --> 12:57.079
You know, I was getting a little nervous, 
the way you were describing me on the air.

12:57.079 --> 12:58.650
Why?

12:58.650 --> 13:00.434
Well, my wife listens to the show.

13:00.434 --> 13:01.575
You're married?

13:01.575 --> 13:06.825
Yeah, but it's okay.  
I still want to go out with you.

13:06.825 --> 13:14.891
So, instead of Buttons and Bows, I have chosen to sing 
a very challenging aria from Verdi's Rigoletto -

13:14.891 --> 13:18.298
something I have never attempted outside the shower.

13:18.298 --> 13:34.144
I certainly hope 
my little gamble turns out as well as Roz's has.

13:34.144 --> 13:46.314
Or even better.

13:46.314 --> 13:47.872
Oh, God!

13:47.872 --> 13:53.218
Well, perhaps they'll pledge to get 
you to stop singing.

13:53.218 --> 13:55.894
Oh, and by the way, thanks so much for 
the cold shower tip.

13:55.894 --> 13:56.720
Did it work?

13:56.720 --> 14:02.905
No, it did not.  It's clearly an old wives tail, 
because I'm still thinking of my old wife's tail.

14:02.905 --> 14:08.513
Yes, well I suppose it stood to reason being showered 
with coldness would only bring Maris more to mind.

14:08.513 --> 14:10.560
Keep making remarks like that, 
I won't help you rehearse.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.619
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.

14:11.619 --> 14:13.280
It's just that I'm awfully nervous.

14:13.280 --> 14:21.763
You know, as much as I admire your willingness to take a leap, 
I did warn you that you were getting into a dangerous aria.?

14:21.763 --> 14:24.262
Oh God, I'm using humor to mask sexual frustration.

14:24.262 --> 14:25.588
It's high school all over again.

14:25.588 --> 14:30.755
Look Niles, I know it's difficult, but Maris has got to learn 
that you're not just someone who can be ordered to perform at will.

14:30.755 --> 14:39.954
Now sit, play!

14:39.954 --> 14:43.914
Next time it looks like I’m going to follow a piece 
of your advice, shoot me in the head first!

14:43.914 --> 14:46.024
Dad!  Why aren't you in Montana?

14:46.024 --> 14:49.934
Fifteen minutes out, a flock of Canadian geese flew 
into one of our engines.

14:49.934 --> 14:52.617
They were the lucky ones!

14:52.617 --> 14:54.707
Next thing you know, 
we're falling five thousand feet.

14:54.707 --> 14:59.665
Smokehouse almonds are flying everywhere, 
people arescreaming and hugging each other.

14:59.665 --> 15:04.756
The guy in the next seat grabbed hold of my hand, 
and you know what? I didn't pull it away!

15:04.756 --> 15:06.153
Then our pilot comes out.

15:06.153 --> 15:10.944
Our landing gear's out, we're gonna have to do 
an emergency belly landing in six feet of foam!

15:10.944 --> 15:15.560
So, five hellish minutes later, 
we're bouncing across the runway.

15:15.560 --> 15:19.304
Then the stewardess comes out and says we're gonna 
have to go down the emergency slide.

15:19.304 --> 15:22.561
So down I go, headfirst into this sea of foam.

15:22.561 --> 15:31.051
Last thing I remember, this fat lady rom across the aisle comes 
barreling down the chute after me like a polyester avalanche!

15:31.051 --> 15:33.499
My God, Dad, I am so sorry.

15:33.499 --> 15:36.483
So-so, these stewardesses, 
were they also covered with foam?

15:36.483 --> 15:50.204
Will you stop it!  Dad, if you'd like to talk about it, 
we're both here for you.

15:50.204 --> 15:55.169
Boy, I tell you, times like this, you just..  
all you can think of is your loved ones,

15:55.169 --> 15:58.668
and how you wish you'd spent more time with them.

15:58.668 --> 16:02.348
Eddie!

16:02.348 --> 16:03.534
Well, let's get back to work.

16:03.534 --> 16:04.630
Mmm-hmm.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.054
I need something to take my mind off the fact 
that at this very moment,

16:07.054 --> 16:15.046
Maris is slipping out of her frilly under-things 
and into a non-fat milk bath.

16:15.046 --> 16:16.421
Is something wrong?

16:16.421 --> 16:20.135
Yes, something’s wrong.  Things turned out so badly for 
Roz and Dad today,

16:20.135 --> 16:24.352
I'm just wondering if my little leap is ill-advised.

16:24.352 --> 16:25.165
Oh, now...

16:25.165 --> 16:27.752
Maybe this aria thing won't turn out so well, 
either.

16:27.752 --> 16:30.078
Just because theirs went wrong 
doesn't mean yours will, too.

16:30.078 --> 16:30.726
Yeah...

16:30.726 --> 16:31.749
They're two isolated incidents.

16:31.749 --> 16:51.512
All right.

16:51.512 --> 16:58.880
Oh, will these infernal temptations never end?!

16:58.880 --> 17:05.327
Oh, tell me the truth.  
Is it as bad as I think it is?

17:05.327 --> 17:10.880
How... bad do you think it is?

17:10.880 --> 17:16.342
Take a leap!  Mr.Maurice hair-designer!  
Trust me!

17:16.342 --> 17:22.286
Children pointing!  Your fault!

17:22.286 --> 17:25.512
Okay, that's it.  I can't take it anymore, 
I'm leaving.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.621
No, Niles!  You can't leave me now, 
I need you more now than ever.

17:27.621 --> 17:32.440
Oh, give it up.  No one who's followed your little 
Take a leap philosophy has ended up even remotely better.

17:32.440 --> 17:37.470
I don't care what you're saying, 
I'm going to Maris.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.072
You will rue the day!

17:40.072 --> 17:59.877
I don't care!  Niles gotta have it!

17:59.877 --> 18:00.793
Oh, Pete.

18:00.793 --> 18:04.655
Hi, Doc.  
I hear you're doing something new this year. Whoa!

18:04.655 --> 18:06.357
What, is it too hard for you?

18:06.357 --> 18:07.760
Me?  No, I'm-I'm worried about you.

18:07.760 --> 18:11.768
I can hit any note. See?

18:11.768 --> 18:17.213
No, Lamb Chop's not here.  
Big Bird isn't here either.

18:17.213 --> 18:19.053
What are you doing up so late?

18:19.053 --> 18:24.293
Oh.  Do you have your mommy's credit card handy?

18:24.293 --> 18:27.393
Have your mommy call us back later, bye-bye.

18:27.393 --> 18:31.761
Well, 
I guess your little aria must be coming up soon.

18:31.761 --> 18:36.743
Yeah - along with some Veal Milanese and a rather 
disappointing Chardonnay.

18:36.743 --> 18:41.185
Oh, Roz, I hope you're not still angry with me for 
the way my advice backfired today?

18:41.185 --> 18:43.240
Oh no, not at all!

18:43.240 --> 18:48.009
In fact, I've been meaning to tell you how much 
I admire you for what you're doing tonight.

18:48.009 --> 18:53.826
After watching me crash and burn like that, you're 
going to go out and sing this very difficult song...

18:53.826 --> 18:59.004
in a foreign language... under these unflattering lights, 
with your clothes soaked with

18:59.004 --> 19:01.352
sweat, on live television...

19:01.352 --> 19:02.256
How long are you going to stay mad at me?

19:02.256 --> 19:05.441
Until the day I get married.

19:05.441 --> 19:10.960
Yo, Doc, Doc! Please, please, I've been going over 
your music, and when we get to this section here,

19:10.960 --> 19:13.536
either I can play really loud, 
or jab you with a pin, because

19:13.536 --> 19:17.944
between you and me, you're not hitting this note 
without a pole vault.

19:17.944 --> 19:20.128
Ten seconds, Dr. Crane.

19:20.128 --> 19:23.600
That's it!  That's it!  I'm not doing the aria!

19:23.600 --> 19:27.630
What?  You're backing out after you made all of us 
take those stupid leaps?

19:27.630 --> 19:30.625
You bet I am!  It may be an unwise man who doesn't 
learn from his own mistakes,

19:30.625 --> 19:34.993
but it's an absolute idiot 
that doesn't learn from other people!

19:34.993 --> 19:37.322
But you promised all your listeners!

19:37.322 --> 19:44.074
Oh, what's the difference?! 
Who watches P.B.S.?!

19:44.074 --> 19:50.346
I'll tell you who: discerning, cultured viewers, 
like yourselves.

19:50.346 --> 19:51.890
Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

19:51.890 --> 19:58.110
And like yourselves, I care about quality programming, 
such as foreign films, classical music, opera ?

19:58.110 --> 20:03.962
which is why I intended to sing a rather challenging 
piece: an aria from Verdi's Rigoletto.

20:03.962 --> 20:11.194
But, who am I to ignore the dozens of phone calls 
that have come in requesting my signature piece,

20:11.194 --> 20:18.745
a rather charming little ditty that I first sang 
three years ago on Classic Western Movie Week.

20:18.745 --> 20:25.537
So without further ado, I give you Buttons and Bows,?
from Paleface.

20:25.537 --> 20:29.039
Maestro, please?

20:29.039 --> 20:31.411
East is East, and West is West

20:31.411 --> 20:34.433
And the wrong one I have chose

20:34.433 --> 20:37.382
Let's go where you keep on wearing those-

20:37.382 --> 20:39.954
Da da dahs, and boppa dohs,

20:39.954 --> 20:44.487
Things and buttons, buttons and bows!

20:44.487 --> 20:46.897
Don't bury me, uh ?lovely pea,

20:46.897 --> 20:49.250
Something, la-la-la!

20:49.250 --> 20:51.986
Let's all go to a... taco show, and

20:51.986 --> 20:54.707
and a how I love, such and thrush,

20:54.707 --> 20:55.530
blow my nose,

20:55.530 --> 20:58.351
You look great in buttons and bows!

20:58.351 --> 21:00.023
I love you in buckskin,

21:00.023 --> 21:07.781
la da-da da-da daaaa!

21:07.781 --> 21:09.529
Everybody!

21:09.529 --> 21:12.148
My bones denounce, the fearful trounce,

21:12.148 --> 21:15.162
and la-la la-la Moldic rose!

21:15.162 --> 21:17.673
Ba-da Seuss, a palm caboose!

21:17.673 --> 21:20.209
and a panda hop, and pantyhose

21:20.209 --> 21:35.165
You look buppity, buttons and bows!

21:35.165 --> 21:41.194
Oh, I bet this is one leap year Dr. Crane won't 
be sorry to see the back of!

21:41.194 --> 21:42.682
Should we rewind it, so we can watch it again?

21:42.682 --> 21:49.498
No, no, not yet, let it finish first, this is 
the verse where he REALLY loses it!

21:49.498 --> 21:51.986
Bippity-boppity, hippity-dos

21:51.986 --> 21:57.822
Something and something, and buttons and bows!

21:57.822 --> 22:02.900
Okay, now you can rewind it!

22:02.900 --> 22:07.878
Hey!
