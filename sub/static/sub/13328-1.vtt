WEBVTT

00:18.083 --> 00:21.417
Man, back in New Zealand,
I was getting it on
with lots of chicks.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.000
- Who?
- Well, uh--

00:24.000 --> 00:25.917
Sarah Fitzpatrick,

00:25.917 --> 00:27.834
uh, Michelle
Fitzpatrick,

00:27.834 --> 00:30.375
Claire Fitzpatrick--
the list goes on.

00:30.375 --> 00:32.959
- That was all of them?
- Well, triple figures.

00:32.959 --> 00:35.750
No that's not
triple figures,
that's three.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.583
Here though, I--

00:37.583 --> 00:40.250
I don't seem to get
with any women, I just talk
about getting with women.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.125
Yeah, but the ones
you talk about are hot.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.458
They're a lot hotter
than the ones you got with
in New Zealand.

00:45.458 --> 00:46.834
That's true.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.583
I do talk about getting
with some pretty hot women.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.834
You don't just
talk about it, man,
you talk about it a lot.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.542
Yeah I suppose
I do talk a lot

00:53.542 --> 00:56.125
about getting with
some very hot women.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.792
- This should be it.
- Yeah, this is it.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.083
This is Dave's place.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.291
- Yeah it's Dave's party.
- Oh, right.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.667
We didn't need a map.
We just live down there.

01:05.667 --> 01:08.166
( theme music playing )

01:16.250 --> 01:17.959
( blows whistle )

01:37.542 --> 01:40.083
( distant dance music
thumping )

01:40.083 --> 01:43.375
Hey, Dave. This is
an awesome party, man.

01:43.375 --> 01:47.041
- Yeah. Great decorations.
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.125 --> 01:49.959
How's it going?

01:49.959 --> 01:51.583
Yeah, it's good,
but look, guys,

01:51.583 --> 01:52.834
I don't want
to be a dick

01:52.834 --> 01:54.917
but could you guys,
like, move away?

01:54.917 --> 01:57.041
I'm trying
to look lonely.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.500
Lonely? What for?

02:00.500 --> 02:02.208
( scoffs )

02:02.208 --> 02:04.125
Chicks are attracted
to lonely guys.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.834
It's a psychological
analogy.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.542
And what about
Eugene?

02:10.959 --> 02:13.000
He knows
what he's doing.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.250
Well, you just look like
you're waiting.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.708
You look good,
but you look like
you're waiting.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.875
Guys, go have a samosa.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.375
Have you tried
the gulab jamuns?
They're off the hook.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.834
What I was trying
to say before is that

02:29.834 --> 02:32.667
after six or seven weeks
girls find me boring.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.792
- Mmm.
- But I'm not sure
what happens,

02:34.792 --> 02:38.542
because I mean that's
about how long it takes
to get to know someone.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.166
Mmm.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.875
( muffled )
Can you move
away, please?

02:44.708 --> 02:46.542
Sure. How long for?

02:48.083 --> 02:49.750
30 minutes.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.458

- Hey, Bret.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.125
That's just Bret.
Turn the light off, Bret.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.959
No no no. It's okay.
Leave it on.

06:42.959 --> 06:45.792
Um, I should
probably go.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.041
Are you sure?

06:47.041 --> 06:50.000
Bret:
So on or off
with the light then?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.083
Yeah, um...

06:52.083 --> 06:54.458
I'll call you. Okay.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.291
Okay.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.125
What happened there?
Did I do something wrong?

07:00.125 --> 07:02.583
- I don't know,
I couldn't really see.
- I did all my moves.

07:02.583 --> 07:06.333
I walked
on the outside of her.
I bought her a kebab.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.041
I paid for half the taxi.

07:08.041 --> 07:10.166
Should I have paid
for the whole taxi?

07:10.166 --> 07:11.750
Should I have paid
for the whole taxi?

07:11.750 --> 07:13.375
- Hmm?
- Bret?

07:13.375 --> 07:16.834
- Bret?
- Did you... did you walk
on the outside of her?

07:16.834 --> 07:19.708
- Yes.
- I don't know then.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.375
I'm going to sleep.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.333
Hey, Bret, I think I know
where I went wrong.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.291
Hmm?

07:32.291 --> 07:35.083
- I think I know where
I went wrong last night.
- Yeah?

07:35.083 --> 07:38.667
Yeah, Sally wanted to leave
when you turned the light on.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.500
I think she
found it weird--

07:40.500 --> 07:42.667
the whole thing
with you there with the--

07:42.667 --> 07:44.166
with the light... on.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.250
Yeah, I think it
might also be

07:46.250 --> 07:48.542
because she and I
used to go out.

07:50.667 --> 07:53.208
Yeah.
It's 'cause you and her
used to go out,

07:53.208 --> 07:55.750
but also because
of the thing with the light.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.834
She's thinking, "Oh...

07:59.834 --> 08:01.542
this is a nice situation."

08:01.542 --> 08:04.041
But then, "Ugh, who--
who turned on the light?"

08:04.041 --> 08:06.542
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

08:06.542 --> 08:10.041
But I think it's mainly
because her and I
used to go out...

08:10.041 --> 08:11.542
for, like, six months.

08:11.542 --> 08:15.041
Yeah, well--
yeah, it's mainly because
you used to go out,

08:15.041 --> 08:18.708
but also mainly
because of the whole
situation with the light.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.000
Yeah, but the last thing
you want to see

08:22.000 --> 08:24.333
when you're hooking up
is your ex in the same room.

08:24.333 --> 08:28.417
Yeah, and you also
don't want to be startled
by a light, do you?

08:28.417 --> 08:30.125
Hmm.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.750
May I interject?

08:33.708 --> 08:36.667
- Hmm?
- What do you
think of this?

08:36.667 --> 08:38.125
It's good.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.041
I'm getting them
for the building.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.333
- Right.
- I just think she
found it off-putting.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.000
Do you want
to give it a shot?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.291
- All right.
- Just a-- ( whistles )

08:47.250 --> 08:48.583
it doesn't work.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.417
Man:
Okay, guys, band meeting.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.250
Bret?

08:52.250 --> 08:55.041
- Bret: Yep?
- Jemaine?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.333
- Jemaine?
- Well, yeah, obviously.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.750
Here?
Well, you're here?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.834
I'm here,
so why do I have to
say that I'm here?

09:01.834 --> 09:03.834
It's just so I've got it
all written down, you know.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.083
Yeah, but I'm here,
so if you can
see me here--

09:06.083 --> 09:08.250
Murray, present.
See? Even if I do it.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.792
It's just how we do it.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.959
So how was, uh,
Dave's party?

09:13.959 --> 09:16.166
- Oh it was good.
- Mmm, it wasn't that good.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.792
You're both aware
I wasn't invited?

09:18.792 --> 09:19.959
No.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.458
Jemaine, did you know?
You did know?

09:22.458 --> 09:23.792
- Yeah.
- You knew, eh?

09:23.792 --> 09:26.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.000
"Jemaine knew."

09:31.333 --> 09:34.250
Item one: fan base;

09:34.250 --> 09:37.166
ways to increase
the american fan base.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.375
What fan base?

09:39.375 --> 09:41.750
- The fan base of the band.
- You mean Mel?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.542
- Hmm.
- That's not a fan base,
that's just a woman.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.792
Yeah, but I'm calling it
a fan base from now on.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.417
It's just easier
when I call,

09:48.417 --> 09:50.834
because if you say,
"Oh, the fan will be there,"

09:50.834 --> 09:54.500
they can tell there's only
one person. I'm trying
to make it look bigger.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.000
It's a base-- put "base"
on the end of it, okay?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.834
- Bret: That sounds good.
- Jemaine: It sounds better.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.333
- I came up with that.
- Do we have any gigs, Murray?

10:02.333 --> 10:04.458
Yeah, I'm getting to that.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.375
I've got a lot
on my plate, Jemaine.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.667
- I'm not just a band manager.
- ( knocks )

10:08.667 --> 10:10.333
- Murray?
- Yeah.

10:10.333 --> 10:13.542
Uh, I wanted you to okay
the new subway poster.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.417
Murray:
Oh wow, Greg.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.625
What about another
exclamation mark?

10:18.875 --> 10:20.583
I don't think
that's necessary.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.041
Not necessary, no.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.792
That's-- good.

10:28.708 --> 10:31.000
What happened
with the gig
at the aquarium?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.959
It was kind of
a misunderstanding.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.875
Um, there was
a typo in the ad.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.083
It was sand they wanted.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.000
Sand, you know,
that wavy font?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It looks like a "b,"
but it was an "s."

10:42.000 --> 10:43.417
But I sent the demo.

10:43.417 --> 10:44.959
So the good news
is that, uh...

10:44.959 --> 10:46.291
they liked it.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.083
They might play it
in the lobby.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.834
- Okay, that's positive.
- Item two--

10:51.875 --> 10:53.291
That's it.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.458
Have you guys got any ideas?

10:55.458 --> 10:57.750
- Uh, music video.
- Oh, a nice one, Bret.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.708
I was just going to say
the same one.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.542
Okay, nice one,
Jemaine and Bret.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.333
I can take Friday
afternoon off, no worries.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.208
- Don't we need
more money for--
- Helen?

11:06.208 --> 11:07.708
Hey it's, uh,
it's Murray--

11:07.708 --> 11:10.000
Hewitt. Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.291
Good. Can I get
Friday afternoon off?

11:14.291 --> 11:16.583
Right.
All right, thanks.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.291
Yep.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.291
How does Saturday
morning sound?

11:26.458 --> 11:27.834
Oh, hey guys.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.291
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, Mel.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.917
Hey, whoa.
Crazy meeting you here, huh?

11:31.917 --> 11:34.750
- What, outside our house?
- ( laughs )

11:34.750 --> 11:36.500
Yeah! Bret!

11:36.500 --> 11:39.333
You're so funny.
I love your sense of humor.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.458
What are you doing down
Mr. Lee's stairwell?

11:43.208 --> 11:45.542
Jogging. Hey, where were
you guys on tuesday?

11:45.542 --> 11:47.083
I went to your gig.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.750
I was at the aquarium
for hours just waiting.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.333
They wouldn't let me stay
after 1:00 A.M., but, um--

11:52.333 --> 11:55.458
- What time
did you guys play?
- It was canceled.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.792
Oh, that sucks!

11:57.792 --> 11:59.500
That's bullshit!

11:59.500 --> 12:01.583
Well, the fish
were beautiful.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.875
They were breeding--
it's mating season

12:03.875 --> 12:05.834
and I-- I saw
fish make love.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.875
- I don't think
we want to hear that.
- No, it's really interesting.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.875
Actually, you know
quite a few species of fish

12:10.875 --> 12:13.792
require two or more
sexual partners--

12:13.792 --> 12:15.834
We have to go now, Mel.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.333
Where?

12:17.333 --> 12:18.959
- Um--
- Home.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.417
That's right.
Yeah yeah.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.583
You-- you just
came from home.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.458
Yeah, we're just
popping out for a second

12:24.458 --> 12:25.834
and then, um,

12:25.834 --> 12:28.542
that's all
we were going to do--
just get some air.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.041
( inhales deeply )

12:30.041 --> 12:31.583
- Mmm.
- Oh.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.500
We always have
such a fun time

12:33.500 --> 12:36.834
when we're
hanging out together.
Awesome.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.375
It's a good cake, man.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.667
It doesn't make
any difference...
Isabella.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.375
- I don't want cake--
- It's top quality.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.667
- Get out of here.
I don't want your cake!
- 20 bucks.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.583
- Give me the tv.
- What an idiot, trying
to sell me a cake.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.291
- It was a beautiful cake.
- Yeah, it was.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.208
So did you guys
have fun at the party?

12:53.208 --> 12:55.291
- Oh, amazing fun.
- It was okay.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.208
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it, Dave.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.375
But I, uh,
wasn't invited.

12:59.375 --> 13:00.792
Oh, that's okay.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.750
Hey, Jemaine,
how'd it go with Sally?

13:02.750 --> 13:04.041
Yeah, pretty good.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.834
- I, uh--
- Yeah?

13:05.834 --> 13:08.792
- Not that well.
- You and her used to go out
before, didn't you?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.792
No, that was me.
She went out with me.

13:10.792 --> 13:13.291
Oh. Oh!

13:13.291 --> 13:15.875
Hey, Jemaine,
I don't know how they do
things back in England--

13:15.875 --> 13:19.041
- Both: New Zealand.
- Yeah, whatever. I don't
really give a shit.

13:19.041 --> 13:22.375
But the point is, going out
with your best friend's
ex-girlfriend

13:22.375 --> 13:24.417
while you still live
with your best friend,

13:24.417 --> 13:27.708
that kind of thing would be
considered a little weird
here in the U.S.

13:27.708 --> 13:30.708
Actually it'd be quite weird
in New Zealand as well.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.708
Jemaine, you should
think about that.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.667
I've told you--
when you're in a band,

13:34.667 --> 13:37.708
you don't get with your
bandmate's girlfriend,
past or present.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.041
- Yes, thanks for that.
- You get a love triangle.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.875
You know?
Fleetwood Mac situation.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.291
Well, there was four of them
so more of a love square,

13:45.291 --> 13:47.250
but, you know,
no one gets on.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.792
- Okay, I see.
- Mind you, they did make some
of their best music back then.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.041
- "Rumors."
- No, that's all true.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.875
Well, the thing is
Bret's cool with it.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.917
- I'm not that cool with it.
- If Bret's cool with it,
that's fine.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.750
Have you got
any video cameras, david?

13:59.750 --> 14:02.417
- Sure, what's your budget?
- Budget?

14:02.417 --> 14:04.583
You mean you need
to bring in a budget?

14:04.583 --> 14:06.333
Like, how much
do you want to spend?

14:06.333 --> 14:07.917
Do you want
a printed-out budget?

14:07.917 --> 14:10.083
No, I want to know how much
money you want to spend--

14:10.083 --> 14:12.625
I haven't worked it all out.
We haven't got much money.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.458
Murray:
And... action!

14:14.458 --> 14:17.583
- ( scraping )
- I don't think that's
a proper camera, Murray.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.542
- Yeah, a mobile-phone camera.
- I think it's mostly a phone.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.667
It's not what they'd
use on a music video
though.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.250
It's what's
we're using, isn't it?
It's all I've got.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.041
- It's taking good footage.
You look good.
- Is it?

14:28.041 --> 14:29.041
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.458
What are these
supposed to be?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.750
Those are your
function buttons
for the robot.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.750
- They look like nipples.
- Don't touch them!

14:34.750 --> 14:37.166
I spent ages
making these, guys.
It looks good.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.458
Now let's
just start again.
That's all I had.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.125
It doesn't look like
Daft Punk.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.834
We wanted ones
like Daft Punk.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.458
I don't know
who he is.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.500
You're just robots
from the future,
all right?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.333
Try not to walk
so funky, Bret,

14:49.333 --> 14:51.834
because you're--
try and make it less cool.

14:51.834 --> 14:52.959
More like--

14:52.959 --> 14:55.000
you know, electronic--
hide your neck.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.083
Put your--
that's right. Okay.

- Yeah.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.542
What makes you
think that?

16:15.542 --> 16:18.125
You just know.
When it happens to you,
you'll know.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.708
- You said Michelle
was the one.
- Yeah, she's the one.

16:20.708 --> 16:23.583
- You said Claire was the one.
- Yeah, she's another one.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.250
So you get more
than one "one"?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.667
Some people are lucky.
I've had a few ones.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.542
So how many ones
can you have?

16:30.542 --> 16:32.041
Five.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.875
- How many have you had?
- Three.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.250
How many have you had?

16:37.041 --> 16:39.750
Just one.
Just one.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.417
Yep, okay.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.166
Okay, well,
I'll see you
later then.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.917
Okay, bye.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.041
Hey, um, Bret?

17:23.041 --> 17:25.125
Do you think it would
be okay if Sally and I

17:25.125 --> 17:27.542
had the apartment
to ourselves tonight?

17:27.542 --> 17:30.000
- What for?
- Some time alone.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.125
Mmm, I was going
to be working on
my secret project.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.917
Your helmet that
looks like your hair?

17:35.917 --> 17:39.041
- Yes.
- How's that going?

17:39.041 --> 17:42.291
It's going pretty good.
I still need to get
more body in the hair.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.834
- It pretty much
looks like a helmet.
- Right.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.208
Well, could you do that
tomorrow night?

17:47.208 --> 17:49.500
Well, it's helmet-hair night,
man, not really.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.667
I mean, I've been
thinking about it for ages.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.291
It's on the board.
You know about it.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.125
You said you were
going to help actually.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.583
Because I can't really
see what I'm doing
when I've got it on.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.625
But there's nothing booked
on any other night.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.041
- Why don't you--
- It's just--

18:01.041 --> 18:03.417
could you swap it
for tuesday night or...

18:04.792 --> 18:07.500
- the other nights?
- Well...

18:07.500 --> 18:10.375
how about you just maybe
don't go out with Sally

18:10.375 --> 18:12.500
so I can hang out
with you guys?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.291
That'd be good.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.083
What are you
talking about?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.417
I can't really hang out
with you guys, can I?
It's a bit weird now.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.000
Of course you can
hang out with us.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.041
Why don't you come to
dinner with us tonight?

18:22.041 --> 18:24.917
I don't want to go on a date
with you and my ex-girlfriend.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.834
It's going to be--
that's going to be weird.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.667
- It won't be weird.
- That is going
to be weird, man.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.625
It won't be weird,
we're all friends.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.792
I like Sally.
You like Sally.

18:33.792 --> 18:36.375
She used to like you.
She really likes me.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.500
- You like me.
- I suppose I do.

18:39.834 --> 18:42.000
It won't be weird.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.166
- No, it's going to be weird.
- It won't be weird.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.208
- That is going to be weird.
- It won't be weird.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.917
- It will be weird.
- It won't be weird.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.750
- It will be weird.
- It won't be weird.

18:51.583 --> 18:54.208
You know, it is
actually a bit weird
with you here, Bret.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.166
Yeah, I should go.
I'll go.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.375
It's fine,
it's fine.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.875
Bret-- Bret was saying that
it was going to be weird
with him here

19:01.875 --> 19:05.208
and i-- I said
it wouldn't be weird,
but it is a bit weird.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.375
Oh.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.375
- Eh?
- Yeah, it is a bit.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.583
Um, it was nice
to see you, Sally.

19:11.583 --> 19:15.583
- You look beautiful.
- Bret, this is my date.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.583
It's just feelings.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.708
You do look beautiful,
I was just about to say that.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.625
- I think I'll probably go.
- No, stay.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.750
Actually it's just like
when Bret and I went out

19:26.750 --> 19:30.125
- and you were always around.
- I've ordered my main,
I'll stay.

19:30.125 --> 19:33.583
- I think you should go.
- Yeah, I should go.
It's a bit weird.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.417
Um... I wouldn't have
ordered the duck.

19:36.417 --> 19:39.041
I spent all my money
on the duck.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.750
Would you be able
to bring the duck home?

19:41.750 --> 19:44.250
- Yeah, yep.
- Okay.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.625
Yeah, I'll go
and nice to see you.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.083
- Bye, Bret.
- See you.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.250
- Yeah, bye, Bret.
- You'll bring the duck?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.625
Yeah, I'll bring the duck.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.625
- That was weird,
wasn't it?
- Yeah, a little.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.125
- Hi, Bret.
Are you okay?
- Oh, hey, Mel.

20:06.125 --> 20:09.166
- Jemaine's on a date
with Sally, right?
- Yeah.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.041
How does that make you feel?

20:11.041 --> 20:12.875
Not good.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.750
Bret, don't worry
about Sally.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.333
I never thought she was
right for you anyway.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.208
What didn't you
like about Sally?

20:19.208 --> 20:21.583
Well, I haven't
actually met Sally.

20:21.583 --> 20:25.000
I just--
sometimes I think the thing
you're looking for

20:25.000 --> 20:27.750
is often standing right
in front of your eyes.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.959
What are you going
to do tonight?

20:30.959 --> 20:32.417
Uh, I'm not sure.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.959
Mel, can we go now?
We've been here
for 2 1/2 hours.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.208
- Is that Doug?
- Yeah, that's Doug.
Don't worry about him.

20:37.208 --> 20:40.458
Just 'cause I'm married to Doug
doesn't mean I can't be
here for you.

20:40.458 --> 20:44.041
- Thanks, Mel.
- You can tell me anything.

20:44.041 --> 20:47.458
Anything. I promise
I won't think you're a pervert.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.959
Okay. Thanks.

20:49.959 --> 20:53.041
- Have I shown you my picture
of Jemaine's lips?
- No.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.792
I have it here
in my wallet. Look.

20:54.792 --> 20:58.417
Those are my cousins,
and there-- that's--
that's Jemaine's lips.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.667
- Oh yeah, that's them.
- Mel, we really have
to go now.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.834
We said we'd call your mom
and she'll go to bed soon.

21:02.834 --> 21:06.625
You should go.
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.875
- Good seeing you, Bret.
- See you, Doug.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.208
- See you-- see you, Mel.
- Yeah.

21:13.208 --> 21:16.000
Bret, don't worry
about Sally, all right?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.834
Whenever I was watching
the two of you

21:17.834 --> 21:20.583
it was obvious that
you were more into her
than she was into you.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.500
- Really?
- Yeah, you could
really tell.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.667
She always looked
kind of bored.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.500
Oh.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.000
Thanks, Mel.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.208
Hey.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.917
- Take care.
- See you.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.542
I was thinking maybe
we could go somewhere
special this weekend.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.625
What was that place
you went to with Bret

21:46.625 --> 21:49.375
that sounded romantic
and-- and cheap?

21:49.375 --> 21:50.750
I'm not sure.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.750
I'm-- I'm quite busy
at the moment.

21:54.041 --> 21:56.375
You know what?
I've left duck juice
all down your top.

21:56.375 --> 22:00.041
- Look, I don't think
we should go out again.
- It's really oily.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.417
You're probably going
to need to get that
dry-cleaned.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.250
- Bret should
pay for it really.
- Don't worry about my top.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.708
Okay, that's good.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.250
I don't think we should
see each other again.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.375
I think it's best if we just
pretend this never happened.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.750
- Maybe we could
have a break?
- A break?

22:16.750 --> 22:19.166
No, there's--
there's no relationship.

22:19.166 --> 22:21.333
Yet. We could
start with a break.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.417
It's not--
it's not going to work.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.667
I'm usually more
charismatic than this.

22:25.667 --> 22:28.041
No, um, it's not that.
It's just that--

22:28.041 --> 22:31.291
I don't know,
I was just looking for a bit
of fun this summer, you know?

22:31.291 --> 22:33.458
And when I met you
at that party, I was drunk.

22:33.458 --> 22:36.792
- I was really drunk.
- Jemaine's Voice: So,
you're leaving, aren't you?

22:36.792 --> 22:38.708
You looked kind of cute
when I was drunk.

22:38.708 --> 22:41.834
Jemaine's Voice:
I knew it.  When you said
just then when you told me

22:41.834 --> 22:44.291
you were leaving,
that's when I definitely knew.

22:44.291 --> 22:47.000
Maybe what I really want
is an Australian.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.208
But if you're trying
to break my heart...

22:49.208 --> 22:50.875
Maybe you guys
know some--

22:50.875 --> 22:52.917
...your plan is flawed
from the start.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.500
I already broke up
with Bret, so I already
broke up with you...

22:55.500 --> 22:58.500
You can't break
my heart, it's liquid.
It melted when I met you.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.708
If you think about it,
we're not really
breaking up now...

23:00.708 --> 23:03.125
- Mmm, hmmm.
- ...because we never
really went out.

23:03.125 --> 23:06.959
- And as you turn around
to leave...
- Jemaine?

23:06.959 --> 23:09.834
...don't turn back to me.

23:10.792 --> 23:12.291
Don't turn around and see

23:12.291 --> 23:15.500
if I'm crying...

26:07.583 --> 26:09.291
It wasn't working.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.834
I can see why
you broke with her.
She was hard work.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.458
Oh no, she broke up with me.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.000
Yeah.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.708
She broke up with me too.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.417
That's what I mean--
it was hard work
staying together

26:19.417 --> 26:22.792
- with her wanting
to break up all the time.
- Oh, okay.

26:22.792 --> 26:26.000

and then get back
together for a while?

Mm, yeah.
Well, for like,
six or seven weeks.

boring.

- Get back together.

Mmm.

- Are you trying to get
back together with Sally?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
No. Just making chitchat.
