♪♪

00:04.380 --> 00:05.960
Previously...

00:05.960 --> 00:07.580
There's KC. I knew
she believed in me.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.580
I'm gonna thank her for
recommending me to be a spy.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.830
She never
recommended you.

00:11.830 --> 00:15.000
She can't know that you're a
spy and I'm your handler.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.250
We think that KC
might be giving intel

00:17.250 --> 00:19.170
to the Other Side.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.080
Your mission is to
get her to talk.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.540
I have a last-minute
mission in Mexico,

00:22.540 --> 00:24.290
so I gotta go
pack my gear.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.790
Let me help you, and you
can tell me all about it.

00:26.790 --> 00:29.250
- You'd do that?
- What are best friends for?

00:29.250 --> 00:31.080
Marisa's on board.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.250
Doesn't suspect a thing.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.500
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Have you seen KC?

00:45.500 --> 00:48.170
Marisa, it's me.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.540
Oh, wow. I knew you were
a little self-conscious

00:50.540 --> 00:53.670
about that pimple, but isn't
that mask a little much?

00:53.670 --> 00:55.290
I got a mission
on a construction site,

00:55.290 --> 00:57.250
so I'm practicing welding.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.040
Oh, can I try?

00:59.040 --> 01:01.330
No, no.

01:01.330 --> 01:05.120
Marisa, you and fire,
they don't really mix.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.380
Let's not forget the Easy
Cake oven incident of 2007.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.210
And 2008.

01:10.330 --> 01:13.120
And last week.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.000
Oh, that reminds me. I forgot my phone.
I'll be right back.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
What part of that
reminded you of your phone?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.330
Oh, oh, probably because

01:20.330 --> 01:22.120
I had to call
the fire department,

01:22.120 --> 01:24.830
and the ambulance.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.620
Oh, yes,
and the insurance company.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.170
Brady, it's Marisa.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.920
( sing-song ) Somebody
has a new mission!

01:34.920 --> 01:37.170
Oh, right. Sorry.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.380
( clears throat )
I just received intel

01:39.380 --> 01:40.670
that KC has a new

Way up here.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.170
I'm talkin' a bird
just flew under me.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.670
Across the south side
of the building,

02:46.670 --> 02:48.170
you'll see Reigns Tower.

02:48.170 --> 02:50.290
We have intel that
a new renegade spy group

02:50.290 --> 02:51.790
is meeting on

02:51.790 --> 02:54.290
the 42nd floor.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.380
Oh, wow, I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.250
- You found them already?
- No.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.250
There's a new vegan spot
open on M Street.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.540
Oh! Tofu Tuesdays.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.420
- KC.
- Sorry, sir.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.250
I got eyes on 'em.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.170
Our informant says
they're brainstorming

03:12.170 --> 03:14.330
some new form of
weaponized technology.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.210
Wait a minute. Wouldn't
it just be easier

03:16.210 --> 03:18.290
for me to be on
the 41st floor of that building?

03:18.290 --> 03:19.960
Or the 43rd floor
of that building?

03:19.960 --> 03:21.330
Or any floor
in that building?

03:21.330 --> 03:23.790
Or any building
with floors?

03:23.790 --> 03:25.380
Their building
is impenetrable.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.210
We've already had
three agents try to get in,

03:27.210 --> 03:28.830
all three failed.

03:28.830 --> 03:31.790
So what I'm hearing is
I'm your fourth choice.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.790
Fifth. Ramirez
is on vacation.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.380
Ho ho ho!
Look here, fellas.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.210
It's the new guy.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.750
Showed up for work
early, huh, new guy?

03:43.750 --> 03:47.170
I think the new guy's
trying to make us look bad.

03:47.170 --> 03:48.540
Is it just my imagination,

03:48.540 --> 03:50.330
or do you keep using
the word guy,

03:50.330 --> 03:52.170
when you can clearly see
that I'm a woman?

03:52.170 --> 03:53.790
My name is Lisa,
and you are?

03:53.790 --> 03:56.580
Roy, and I'm real sorry. I hope
I didn't offend you too badly.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.330
No, you offended me very well.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.790
Almost as though you've
had some practice at it.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.380
( laughs )

04:02.380 --> 04:04.210
Oops.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.170
Sorry, new guy.

04:06.170 --> 04:08.000
( derisive laughter )

04:12.290 --> 04:14.380
Hey, is it just me, or are
those guys a bunch of...

04:14.380 --> 04:15.580
Sexist pigs.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.210
I was gonna go with
knuckle-dragging cavemen,

04:17.210 --> 04:19.040
but you've
known 'em longer.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.040
Don't worry,
in a couple of days,

04:21.040 --> 04:23.380
they'll get tired of messing
with you, and it'll get better.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.040
So they'll drop
the misogynistic attitude?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.420
No, they'll just
stop talking to you.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.580
They haven't said
a word to me in three years.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.210
And you're okay
with that?

04:33.210 --> 04:36.210
Sure. I'm all about
peace and quiet.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.960
( tool buzzing loudly )

04:38.960 --> 04:41.170
Are you sure you chose
the right profession?

04:42.580 --> 04:44.170
Are you sure you...

04:50.500 --> 04:52.750
It fell out last night.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.710
And my mom said to
put my tooth under my pillow,

04:56.710 --> 05:00.170
and this time, the tooth
fairy left me five dollars.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.250
( all exclaiming )

05:02.250 --> 05:04.880
Ha!

05:04.880 --> 05:06.540
What's so funny, Judy?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.210
The tooth fairy?
Please.

05:08.210 --> 05:11.670
She's just a puppet
of capitalist society.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.670
No, she's a nice lady.

05:13.670 --> 05:16.420
So you're fine with someone
breaking into your house,

05:16.420 --> 05:19.040
and taking your teeth, just as long
as she leaves you a few bucks?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.540
I mean, what if she broke
in and took your laptop?

05:21.540 --> 05:24.290
- Why would she do that?
- Who's gonna stop her? You're out cold.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.330
( crying )

05:31.330 --> 05:34.210
We're going to have another
one of those meetings

05:34.210 --> 05:36.380
in the principal's office where
she yells at me, aren't we?

05:36.380 --> 05:38.250
Don't worry,
I know the way.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.790
All the construction workers
instantly disliked me,

05:45.790 --> 05:48.960
and not because I accidentally
dropped the bathroom key

05:48.960 --> 05:51.210
off the side of the building,

05:51.210 --> 05:53.040
but because I'm a woman.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.620
Maybe they're just
jealous because

05:54.620 --> 05:57.580
you still have
all of your original fingers.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.420
Okay, look.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.790
All I'm saying is,
it's 2017.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.880
Did they not get the memo
that men and women are equals?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.620
- Hey, Marisa.
- Hey.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.380
I had such
a great time last night.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.580
You actually made
studying fun.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.790
At least until we got
kicked out of the library

06:11.790 --> 06:13.170
for laughing about
Lake Titicaca.

06:13.170 --> 06:16.210
Oh, good.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.790
It's the largest lake
in South America.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.380
I don't really see
how that's funny.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.210
Let's see.
Tall, overly serious,

06:23.210 --> 06:25.420
doesn't get the joke;
you must be KC.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.250
Cute, condescending,

06:27.250 --> 06:29.420
not really looking to
kiss up to Marisa's best friend.

06:29.420 --> 06:33.170
You must be clueless...
I mean, uh, Brady.

06:33.170 --> 06:35.210
All right, I take it back.
You are funny.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.540
Are we still
meeting up after school?

06:37.540 --> 06:39.330
Earlier, if I can convince
Mr. Garcia

06:39.330 --> 06:41.290
that my gall bladder
needs to come out.

06:41.290 --> 06:42.540
For the third time?

06:42.540 --> 06:44.210
Dang. Your gall bladder
gets taken out

06:44.210 --> 06:46.330
more often than I do.

06:46.330 --> 06:47.790
Wow, you really
are funny.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.330
I wasn't joking that time.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.170
See you guys later.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.580
Bye.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.040
So... what's up
with this Brady guy?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.000
He's just a friend.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.250
Really? 'Cause you went
to the library for this guy.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.380
Now you're hanging out
after school.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.750
Somebody's got
a new boyfriend.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.380
Uh, no, somebody's
got a boy who's a friend.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.790
Marisa, I am the only
friend that you've ever had

07:13.790 --> 07:16.290
that you've never kissed.

07:16.290 --> 07:19.250
KC, just a second ago,
you were complaining about

07:19.250 --> 07:21.080
being treated differently
because you're a woman.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.210
Now you're doing
the exact same thing to me.

07:22.210 --> 07:23.670
How am I doing that?

07:23.670 --> 07:26.330
You assume that guys
can be friends with girls,

07:26.330 --> 07:28.040
but this girl can't
be friends with guys.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.670
Very true.
You know what, you're right.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.250
I'm sorry.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.620
Could you please tell me
what's so funny

07:33.620 --> 07:37.040
about Lake Titicaca...
Oh! Ha ha!

07:37.040 --> 07:38.880
I get it now.
It's funny.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.790
What a day.
I hate humans!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.000
We're not so crazy
about you either.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.290
I actually got a lecture
by my teacher

07:51.290 --> 07:53.330
from taking a stand
against the tooth fairy.

07:53.330 --> 07:56.250
I know. The Organization
already called about it.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.000
They want you to be
more kid-friendly.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.540
They think you'll
blow your cover

07:59.540 --> 08:00.880
if you're too sophisticated.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.750
Sophisticated?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.460
How ridiculous is that?

08:04.460 --> 08:06.210
As
William Shakespeare said,

08:06.210 --> 08:08.250
"Lord, what fools
these mortals be."

08:11.000 --> 08:13.040
Yeah, I don't know why they
think you're too sophisticated.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.170
All ten-year-olds
quote Shakespeare.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.620
They assigned you
a youth expert

08:18.620 --> 08:21.250
to teach you how to be
more... immature.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.460
Seriously? Some sap is gonna
come over here and dumb me down?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.170
Already here.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.170
Ernie Cooper,
immaturity expert.

08:28.170 --> 08:32.000
Building you up
by dumbing you down.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.790
Well, I'm in good hands,

08:33.790 --> 08:35.540
because I feel
dumber already.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.210
Oh, no, this is
a disaster.

08:45.210 --> 08:47.420
What are
those renegades doing?

08:47.420 --> 08:49.380
No, the vegan place
is being shut down.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.960
The neighborhood didn't
even give it a chance.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.710
Wait a minute.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.500
- I'm getting some chatter.
- What are they talking about?

08:58.500 --> 09:00.710
They made a device that
literally melts your brain.

09:00.710 --> 09:03.210
They're calling it
a sonic brain imploder.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.080
All right, everybody,
that's an hour for lunch.

09:10.790 --> 09:12.380
( men laughing )

09:14.210 --> 09:16.380
Oh, looks like you could use
some iron in your diet,

09:16.380 --> 09:18.380
new lady co-worker.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.250
See, I didn't call you
guy that time.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.540
Right?

09:21.540 --> 09:23.620
- Hey.
- JOHNSON: Let it go.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.080
You think you're
such a big tough guy?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.040
Listen here, tough guy.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.420
It turns out, you messed
with the wrong girl.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.960
- Hey.
- Let it go.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.790
- What's going on here?
- I have no idea.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.670
I was minding
my own business,

09:35.670 --> 09:37.380
and Lisa comes over
and attacks me,

09:37.380 --> 09:38.460
even though I have been
nothing but nice

09:38.460 --> 09:40.750
and supportive
to her, right, guys?

09:40.750 --> 09:42.790
That is not what happened at all.
Tell them, Crystal.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.460
Whoa. Leave me out of this.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.380
KC, let it go.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.790
Apologize to Roy,
or you're fired.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.960
If you think,
in a million years,

09:50.960 --> 09:53.710
- I would apologize to Roy...
- KC, don't blow the mission.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.420
then you are 100% correct.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.170
Sorry, Roy.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.830
What was that again?
I didn't quite hear you.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.380
I said I'm sorry, Roy.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.960
One more time,
but with some feeling.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.670
I said I'm sorry, Roy.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.960
Since it will make for
a more productive

10:08.960 --> 10:11.420
and harmonious workplace,
I will be the bigger man

10:11.420 --> 10:12.880
and accept your apology.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.170
Hm.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.120
All right then.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.620
He's lucky the foreman
was around,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.920
or his butt would've
been accepting my boot.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.710
Marisa, you're doing
such a great job.

10:28.710 --> 10:32.710
Thanks. Eating spaghetti
can be pretty tricky.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.170
But if you chop it up
and use a spoon,

10:37.170 --> 10:38.920
there is zero mess,

10:38.920 --> 10:41.120
and it is like
eating noodle cereal.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.250
How fun is that?

10:43.250 --> 10:46.000
Anyway, uh...

10:46.000 --> 10:48.710
I need you to pump
KC for more details

10:48.710 --> 10:50.750
about this construction
mission,

10:50.750 --> 10:53.000
like where exactly
is it,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.330
and what is she
looking for.

10:54.330 --> 10:57.000
Fine, as long as she
lays off the attitude.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.710
Uh, what attitude?

10:58.710 --> 11:00.290
She's been teasing me

11:00.290 --> 11:02.080
about us being
boyfriend and girlfriend.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.580
Ha. Actually,

11:04.580 --> 11:07.380
maybe we should be posing as
boyfriend and girlfriend.

11:07.380 --> 11:10.540
Yeah, I don't mean to back
you up into the friend zone,

11:10.540 --> 11:14.380
but, uh...
beep, beep, beep.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.580
We do spend
a lot of time together,

11:16.580 --> 11:18.750
and it would be
a better cover.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.960
Yeah, I just made
this huge point to KC

11:20.960 --> 11:24.000
about how guys and girls can just
be friends, so it would just...

11:24.000 --> 11:26.830
Well, you do still wanna be
part of the Organization, right?

11:26.830 --> 11:29.000
Well, yeah, of course.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.120
Then please stop questioning everything
I tell you and just follow orders.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.420
Yes, sir.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.380
Well, you don't
have to be so formal about it.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.790
You're my girlfriend.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.790
Just call me bae.

11:40.790 --> 11:44.880
You should know that
I'm ordering two desserts,

11:44.880 --> 11:48.120
and, um, you're
paying... bae.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.500
If you're gonna continue
to pass for a child,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.170
you need to act like one.

11:56.170 --> 11:59.080
Now what's the most
childish thing you can do?

11:59.080 --> 12:02.170
Mmm... pee in a pool.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.580
Gross first guess.

12:04.580 --> 12:07.620
But no.
It's throwing a tantrum.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.710
Ernie, why would I throw
a tantrum

12:09.710 --> 12:11.210
when I can simply
outwit my opponent,

12:11.210 --> 12:13.170
and debase him
using logic?

12:13.170 --> 12:15.380
- It's what kids do.
- Well, I'm not doing it.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.830
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.790
I am the coach, and you
have to do what I say.

12:19.790 --> 12:22.330
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.210
No, I don't, no, I
don't, no, I don't!

12:24.210 --> 12:27.000
No, I don't!

12:28.500 --> 12:30.580
Okay.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.330
Good first lesson.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.920
Why don't you
put the chair down,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.250
preferably not on my head,
and we'll resume later.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.120
Excuse me, Roy, yeah.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.250
Is there any reason why
you gave everyone else a job

12:46.250 --> 12:49.170
and not me, because I can
do anything a guy can do.

12:49.170 --> 12:50.540
Okay, and before you say it,

12:50.540 --> 12:53.040
yes, I can write
my name in the snow.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.830
All I need is a big iced tea
and about ten minutes.

12:55.830 --> 12:58.290
Relax, Lisa.
I know you're capable.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.790
That's why I saved the most
important job for you.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.920
Really? Okay.
Bring it on.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.250
I need you to hold this beam
while I bolt it down.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.750
Yeah, no problem.

13:06.750 --> 13:11.040
All right.
Here we go.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.620
- You got it?
- Yep.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.250
- Hold on tight now.
- Okay.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.830
There you go.
All right.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.500
Now where did
I put that drill?

13:20.500 --> 13:24.000
Uh, Roy? This beam's
getting a little heavy.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.250
Fortunately, you can do
anything a guy can do, right?

13:27.250 --> 13:30.120
You know what, I just remembered,
I don't own a drill.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.830
I should buy one.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.750
Oh, they got you
holding the beam.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.420
Another week or so, and they'll
ignore you completely.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.210
You're on your way,
new girl.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.290
Thank you.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.580
Thanks. Hey,
quick question.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.250
Is there any reason why you didn't
have my back the other day?

13:51.250 --> 13:53.540
It's bad enough the guys
here treat us like dirt.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.000
- We could at least support each other.
- Why?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.120
- Because we're both women. - You know
the problem with your generation?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.330
People in your generation keep
telling people in my generation

14:01.330 --> 14:04.210
there's something
wrong with it?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.830
My point is, your whole life,
you've been told

14:06.830 --> 14:09.830
that girls can do anything,
and we're all equal,

14:09.830 --> 14:11.620
but guess what,
in the real world,

14:11.620 --> 14:12.960
it doesn't always
work that way.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.250
Said the female
construction worker.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.080
I don't know anybody's
grandma who had that job.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.420
That right there
is called progress.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.330
That's what happens
when women support each other.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.250
So do you think
maybe next time,

14:25.250 --> 14:28.170
- you could have my back?
- No. But you can have mine.

14:28.170 --> 14:30.420
That is not what
I meant, and you know it.

14:36.790 --> 14:39.580
I mean, not only is
this mission crushing my spirit,

14:39.580 --> 14:42.210
it's crushing my arms.

14:42.210 --> 14:45.290
I can't even
eat my applesauce.

14:45.290 --> 14:48.250
Oh, I am so sorry.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.330
You know what,
I am here for you.

14:50.330 --> 14:54.290
Think of me as
your sounding board.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.710
So, tell me more
about this mission.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.960
Well, I mean,
this guy Roy--

14:59.960 --> 15:02.210
And where is
this construction site?

15:02.210 --> 15:04.040
It's downtown.
Anyway, he's just--

15:04.040 --> 15:05.620
And what is
the exact cross streets?

15:05.620 --> 15:08.080
K and Constitution.
Why do you care?

15:08.080 --> 15:10.080
I totally don't.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.210
Oh, but just
out of curiosity,

15:13.210 --> 15:14.540
what is the point
of this mission?

15:14.540 --> 15:17.080
Something about
sonic weaponry.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.250
- Anyway, they're so--
- Oh, gotta go.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.620
I thought you were supposed
to be my "sounding board."

15:21.620 --> 15:23.250
Where are you going?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.380
Just to see
my boyfriend Brady.

15:25.380 --> 15:28.170
- Uh, your what?
- I'm sorry, what?

15:28.170 --> 15:30.170
Did you just say
your boyfriend Brady?

15:30.170 --> 15:32.170
Yeah, so...
Oh, hey.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.710
Did you see this cute
necklace he got me?

15:33.710 --> 15:36.210
Okay.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.670
What exactly
are we doing here,

15:40.670 --> 15:43.040
because I specifically
remember you making

15:43.040 --> 15:44.880
a huge deal out of
the fact

15:44.880 --> 15:46.460
that I assumed
Brady was your boyfriend,

15:46.460 --> 15:48.290
and now, you're just gonna
casually mention it,

15:48.290 --> 15:50.420
- and hope I don't notice.
- Wow, you would think

15:50.420 --> 15:51.620
that my best friend
would be happy

15:51.620 --> 15:53.290
about my new relationship,
but no.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.620
I'm just gonna pretend
this conversation

15:55.620 --> 15:57.380
never happened.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.330
Well, you did a great job

15:59.330 --> 16:00.580
pretending the last one
didn't happen,

16:00.580 --> 16:01.920
so it shouldn't be
too tough for ya.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.380
Thus concludes one of
the most important lessons

16:08.380 --> 16:10.210
on childlike behavior.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.880
Now let's see
how much you've retained.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.170
Fine. Quiz me.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.170
Classic fart.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.040
( makes fart noise )

16:17.040 --> 16:19.290
- Horn fart.
- ( makes horn fart noise )

16:19.290 --> 16:21.210
- Whisper fart.
- ( makes whisper fart noise )

16:21.210 --> 16:23.710
- Scoot and poot.
- ( rhythmic farting noises )

16:27.210 --> 16:29.250
Beautiful, Judy.
Beautiful.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.290
Oh, I'm not done yet.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.920
I have an extra one
just for you.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.380
Silent but deadly.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.750
Never been prouder.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.040
She's investigating something
to do with sonic weapons.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.170
Well done, Marisa.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.330
- You are turning into quite the spy.
- Thank you.

16:53.330 --> 16:56.000
Oh, and thank you so much
for getting me that bracelet

16:56.000 --> 16:58.040
- to go with this necklace.
- I never got you a bracelet.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.210
Actually, you did.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.250
I, uh, borrowed
your credit card.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.330
Turns out
I'm quite the spy.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.460
Hey, bad news.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.210
The Organization
is on to us.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.920
KC Cooper
is listening in

17:15.920 --> 17:17.580
from the construction site
next door.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.880
They know about
the sonic imploder.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.620
We got no choice.
Eliminate her.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.330
One for work...

17:36.170 --> 17:39.290
and one for me.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.330
Huh. Cheddar.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.540
Hey, what are you
doing over there?

17:51.540 --> 17:53.620
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.170
Really? Well, it's kinda
my job to worry about it.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.620
I'm only gonna ask you this one time.
What is that thing?

18:05.620 --> 18:07.330
It's a sonic
brain imploder.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.120
When that timer
reaches zero,

18:09.120 --> 18:11.250
it's gonna melt
your brain.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.420
Roy, you need to block
the elevator, okay?

18:19.420 --> 18:20.960
You cannot let him escape.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.330
He just put in
a sonic brain imploder.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.250
Whatever that is,
it's not my problem.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.420
He's also
stealing your lunch.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.330
My lunch?!
You piece of garbage!

18:33.920 --> 18:36.500
Hey!
Yeah, you're on your own.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.290
- Come on, back up.
- Okay, okay.

18:41.290 --> 18:43.330
Back.
Let's go, keep going.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.670
- Back up.
- Okay.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.750
I mean, come on, man.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.290
We can work
this out, right?

18:54.290 --> 18:55.540
I agree.

18:59.290 --> 19:01.170
Have a good trip.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.170
I wish you a happy life.

19:03.170 --> 19:04.880
All four minutes
you got left.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.330
Tell me how to defuse it.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.170
Believe me, now that I'm
stuck here with you,

20:00.170 --> 20:02.170
I'd very much
like to help you,

20:02.170 --> 20:03.420
but I'm a planter,
not a defuser.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.710
You, uh, you got everything
under control there, right?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.330
Yeah, don't worry, Roy.
This is a brain imploder.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.960
It shouldn't affect you.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.710
( nervous laughter )
Okay.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.380
What's wrong with
the elevator?

20:19.380 --> 20:21.210
Crystal, you gotta
get outta here.

20:21.210 --> 20:23.330
- This thing could blow at any time.
- What are you gonna

20:23.330 --> 20:25.120
do with that, just throw it
over the side of the building?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.210
And melt everyone's brain
down in the street?

20:27.210 --> 20:29.080
- It's an option.
- No, it's not!

20:30.500 --> 20:32.290
I gotta find a way to stop
this thing from detonating.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.830
I can help.
Give it to me.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.540
This is dangerous stuff.
Take a walk, honey.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.250
Shut your pie hole, Roy!

20:39.290 --> 20:41.250
Before I was in construction,
I was in demolition.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.250
- Bring it over here.
- Okay.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.420
What good is that
gonna do?

20:47.420 --> 20:49.500
It can't hurt us
if it's encased in concrete.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.170
That's right, the sound waves
will never penetrate the mix.

20:56.670 --> 20:57.960
Are you sure
about that?

21:04.170 --> 21:06.000
Well, I am now.

21:08.330 --> 21:11.540
- Crystal, you did it.
- No, we did it.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.210
Thank you so much
for having my back.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.960
Sorry I didn't have it earlier.
You were right.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.750
You guys are great.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.460
I mean, girls.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.670
I mean, people.

21:21.670 --> 21:24.000
So... Roy.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.830
Uh-oh.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.790
I'm assuming you're gonna be
a bit more respectful

21:29.790 --> 21:31.420
to the women you work with
from now on.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.790
Yes, I'll be
more respectful.

21:32.790 --> 21:36.500
I'm sorry, I didn't
quite hear that.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.920
I said I'll be
more respectful.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.380
Mm, one more time,
with a little bit of feeling.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.120
Yes, I'll be more respectful!

21:43.120 --> 21:44.330
Now you're gonna
cut me outta this cage, yeah?

21:44.330 --> 21:47.460
You are a smart,
independent man.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.080
I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.170
Rob, your name's on TV.
