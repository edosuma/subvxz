09:28.276 --> 09:30.320
Nope.
That's‐‐

09:30.403 --> 09:31.571
no holla.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.614
Never holla.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.198
Now, just sit your ass down.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.075
[Liam]
Yes, sir.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.622
[Anne]
I mean, take your time.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.581
Business meetings
can start late.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.582
That's professional.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.625
I'm sorry.
I got held up at the ATM.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.294
You know, I couldn't get
my breakfast sandwich.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.796
My morning's all fucked,
and I'm hangry‐‐

09:47.879 --> 09:49.506
Shut up
and check out that line, son.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.591
All asking for tartar sauce.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.759
Drove up new business.

09:52.842 --> 09:53.760
I underestimated you.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.637
‐ You have game.
‐ It was easy.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.055
Middle school was
having a field day.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.891
You know, three‐legged‐races,
egg toss shit.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.518
You know, it was like
taking candy from a baby.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.604
Well, here's your cut, partner.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.855
Thank you, partner.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.649
[Lori] Yo!
I got a line forming in here

10:07.732 --> 10:09.651
that's longer
than my grandma's tits!

10:09.734 --> 10:10.068
Clock in, pirates!

10:10.151 --> 10:10.985
Sorry, Lori.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.238
Yes, master.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.158
Have fun deep‐frying shit
in trans fats.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.451
Oh, I will.
Jealous?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.166
[Lip]
Hey.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.210
Hey, little man!

10:27.293 --> 10:30.130
How's my favorite nephew?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.631
[Lip]
Let me take an uninterrupted

10:31.714 --> 10:33.550
nine‐minute nap last night.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.093
You eager to get back to work?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.136
Already?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.012
Oh, no, no.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.180
Listen, I was wondering
if I could

10:39.264 --> 10:41.182
get an advance
on my paycheck.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.059
No problem.
Cami'll cut ya a check.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.894
Hey, Cami!

10:44.978 --> 10:46.187
Ca‐‐

10:46.271 --> 10:47.647
Lip needs an advance!

10:47.730 --> 10:48.648
Thank you.

10:48.731 --> 10:48.815
Thanks.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.194
‐ [Cami] Hey.
‐ [Lip] Hey.

10:53.278 --> 10:53.820
‐ [Lip] You want to see him?
‐ Yeah.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.118
[Cami] Any news on when
Tami's getting out?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.744
Not yet.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.372
They said they were moving her
into a regular room today.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.957
So‐‐and they said
that Freddie

11:06.040 --> 11:07.458
can come see her,
which is‐‐is good.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.544
Thank God.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.920
Killing her not
being able to hold him.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.756
It's killing her not to be
able to wash her hair, too.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.466
You know, I got
an itemized list

11:15.550 --> 11:18.219
of hair products
to go buy after this.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.263
Um, look, Lip.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.306
Yeah.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.473
About the advance.

11:22.557 --> 11:25.393
The IRS called yesterday.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.896
I'm supposed to garnish
your paycheck this week

11:27.979 --> 11:28.313
by half.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.147
Wait, what?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.565
I don't know.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.441
Something about
student loans?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.235
Or your Social Security?

11:34.319 --> 11:35.737
Right.
No, sorry.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.947
I, um...
I‐‐I can take care of that.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.823
I'll take care of that.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.994
Debbie used
my real Social Security

11:43.077 --> 11:43.620
on a bank account?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.039
Have I taught her nothing?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.749
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Frank.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.543
Look, we've all had accounts
frozen by the IRS.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.086
What was she thinking?

11:52.170 --> 11:57.008
I haven't used my real Social
since draft‐dodging in '69.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.093
Well, you can
lead a horse to water,

11:59.177 --> 11:59.761
but if the camel's
an idiot...

11:59.844 --> 12:00.720
What are you doing?

12:00.803 --> 12:01.763
No,
don't‐‐don't‐‐don't‐‐

12:01.846 --> 12:03.514
don't‐‐do‐‐
[groans]

12:03.598 --> 12:05.183
I figured
I'd give it a shot.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.434
It ate the card.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.435
[Frank]
God dammit!

12:07.518 --> 12:08.978
You think this is funny,

12:09.062 --> 12:12.190
don't you,
you little robot nerd in there!

12:12.273 --> 12:15.068
You and your big bank
Big Brother

12:15.151 --> 12:16.277
and paving the way
for automation!

12:16.361 --> 12:19.155
This is horse shit!

12:20.114 --> 12:22.033
Hey, we're gonna call
your Aunt Debbie, huh?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.952
Yes, we are.
Yes, we are.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.495
It'll just take a sec.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.996
Boop, boop, boop, hoo.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.752
Hi, Aunt Debbie.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.296
It's Lip and Fred calling.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.298
And we were just wondering
if you happened

12:37.382 --> 12:38.841
to use my real fucking
Social Security

12:38.925 --> 12:41.261
and place of employment
when you put me

12:41.344 --> 12:42.595
on the bank account
for my debit card?

12:42.679 --> 12:45.306
'Cause I've got Sallie Mae
calling

12:45.390 --> 12:47.308
and my paycheck got garnished,

12:47.392 --> 12:49.018
and this is exactly what I want
to be dealing with

12:49.102 --> 12:50.603
with Tami in the hospital.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.938
So I'm feeling a little bit

12:52.021 --> 12:53.231
like I might stab you
in the fuckin' eye.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.816
Call me back.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.651
You ready, Freddie?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.152
Let's go.
Pa, pa, pa.

12:58.236 --> 12:58.820
[man] If somebody comes
to the workplace

12:58.903 --> 13:01.030
talking about unionization,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.615
you probably have somebody,

13:02.699 --> 13:05.493
likely from management,
come down here

13:05.576 --> 13:07.996
and tell you that
unions are bad, right?

13:08.079 --> 13:10.290
Hey,
who is this guy?

13:10.373 --> 13:11.207
Union rep.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.167
He stopped us on
the way in to tell us

13:13.251 --> 13:14.919
about the advantages
of organizing.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.629
I'm gonna give him
one more minute

13:16.713 --> 13:18.881
just to get that free T‐shirt,
and then I'm gonna clock in.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.009
What the hell
is on your wrist?

13:21.092 --> 13:21.301
A tennis bracelet.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.011
Why?

13:23.094 --> 13:24.220
Because I'm worth it.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.722
But why would we unionize?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.432
Isn't our thing
that we're not union?

13:27.515 --> 13:29.851
Like, in a good way?

13:29.934 --> 13:30.727
Yeah, but apparently
we can get overtime

13:30.810 --> 13:33.354
and dental if we
listen to this guy.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.356
[man]
Actually, what I said was

13:35.440 --> 13:38.359
we have to fight for
paid overtime and dental.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.653
2019 is a big negotiations
year for us,

13:40.737 --> 13:42.864
and we're gonna fight like hell

13:42.947 --> 13:44.615
for all of our members.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.826
Let me ask you something...

13:46.909 --> 13:48.369
Debbie.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.079
Debbie.
All right.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.956
Did you know

13:52.040 --> 13:53.541
that this is what
the ironworker's union gets

13:53.624 --> 13:57.045
as an annual
childcare credit?

13:57.128 --> 13:58.421
I want a childcare credit.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.381
Yeah, I know you do.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.258
Plus paid holidays,
paid overtime,

14:02.341 --> 14:05.261
pension and benefits,
job security.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.721
Right?
You need it,

14:06.804 --> 14:09.599
and the only way to get it
is with the union.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.351
Now, do you have a voice,
Debbie?

14:13.644 --> 14:14.270
Yes.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.230
"Yes" or "yeah"?

14:16.314 --> 14:18.232
Yes, bitch!

14:18.316 --> 14:20.318
Damn.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.611
‐ I know.
‐ That's crazy soon.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.196
Yo, you know the rumor is,

14:23.279 --> 14:25.698
they're trying to kick out
the nonviolent offenders.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.617
Making room
for the violent offenders,

14:27.700 --> 14:28.701
murderers and armed robbers

14:28.785 --> 14:31.287
and the true derelicts
like us.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.622
That's right.
[laughs]

14:32.705 --> 14:34.207
I mean,
I blew up a van.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.668
Look, I shot a man
in the face seven times.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.504
I tortured a rival gang leader

14:39.587 --> 14:42.090
for two weeks,
fed his body to my pit bulls.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.341
[Dallas]
Look, man, you know to watch

14:43.424 --> 14:44.884
your back right now though,
right?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.135
When a brother gets his date,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.179
people start coming at him
all jealous,

14:48.262 --> 14:50.056
trying to sabotage his parole.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.265
[Cobb]
How'd your boy take it?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.351
Mickey?
Uh...

14:53.434 --> 14:54.894
He didn't really say much,
you know?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.312
What's his position?

14:56.395 --> 14:57.939
His position?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.273
[Dallas]
His position, man.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.692
Like, what's your deal
on the outside,

15:01.776 --> 15:03.194
you know,
when one of you is out

15:03.277 --> 15:04.904
and the other one is
still in here?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.405
Like me and Consuelo.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.157
He's out; I'm in.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.368
We're doing long‐distance
the first two years

15:10.451 --> 15:11.744
with an option
to renew,

15:11.828 --> 15:12.745
and we granted
mutual permission to engage

15:12.829 --> 15:15.414
in sexual activity
with other people

15:15.498 --> 15:17.250
so long as there's no
kissing on the mouth.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.588
Yo, tell me that you and Mickey
have had the talk, right?

15:24.215 --> 15:25.091
I mean...
[laughter]

15:25.174 --> 15:26.467
Oh, shit!

15:26.551 --> 15:28.427
Oh, this brother is fucked!

15:28.511 --> 15:29.971
I mean, why
would we talk about

15:30.054 --> 15:32.265
something completely
hypothetical?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.683
My sentence was supposed
to be three to five years.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.101
They didn't have the talk.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.688
Look, man, that is
prison‐gay 101, Gallagher.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.189
You gotta have the talk.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.233
Man, you gotta know
what the deal is.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.152
You gotta know
where you stand.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.653
Otherwise people get hurt.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.462
Psst!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.298
Carl!

16:05.381 --> 16:06.966
You want
a hot fish filet?

16:07.049 --> 16:07.925
[laughter]

16:08.009 --> 16:09.177
[Carl]
Nice.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.178
Very mature.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.345
[KJ]
Jesus, Stump.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.430
Grow up.

16:12.513 --> 16:17.143
[laughter]

16:17.226 --> 16:18.936
[scoffs]

16:19.020 --> 16:20.438
[scoffs]

16:20.521 --> 16:22.023
Okay, Carl, come with me.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.152
The fish dicks can
handle things, can't they?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.196
‐ Yes, Lori.
‐ Sorry, Lori.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.697
I got a special
cleaning assignment for you,

16:29.780 --> 16:31.199
my little pirate.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.116
Come with me.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.744
Oh, spoiler alert:
It's already clean.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.038
So then what am I cleaning?

16:37.121 --> 16:37.872
Hey, use a safe‐word!

16:37.955 --> 16:40.082
"Harder" is not
a good safe word.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.587
See, that's the thing, Liam.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.548
Pride equals job
equals self‐esteem

16:47.632 --> 16:49.383
equals more pride.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.260
Repeat that back to me.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.428
[Liam] Pride equals self‐esteem
equals pride.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.513
Right.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.806
See, that's why I do what I do.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.099
That's why I sell used cars.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.351
Because I believe in value.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.729
It's rewarding to put
a beautiful,

17:01.812 --> 17:04.649
proud black man
in a good, reliable car.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.942
Let him hold his head sky high.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.236
[Liam] I just wish there
was a list of rules.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.738
How to be a black man
in America.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.200
Which America?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.493
This one?

17:15.576 --> 17:16.827
[MaVar]
No, no, no, see:

17:16.911 --> 17:18.246
There's black America,

17:18.329 --> 17:20.081
like here in South Side.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.707
And we're black,
and there's a set of rules

17:21.791 --> 17:22.583
for how to be black here,
right?

17:22.667 --> 17:25.086
Gotta be strong
but never the aggressor.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.256
Can't let anyone punk you.
No open toe shoes, etcetera.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.675
But then there's being black
in white America.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.260
Now, which America
we talking about?

17:32.343 --> 17:33.302
I'm not sure.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.305
All right.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.515
Which elementary school
did you go to?

17:37.598 --> 17:40.101
Hopkins Academy.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.270
Okay, we going
straight white America.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.771
Rules for a black man
are simple:

17:43.854 --> 17:45.606
Never go out after 6:00 p. m.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.942
Never wear a hoodie
darker than sky blue.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.693
And never acknowledge
sexual desires

17:48.776 --> 17:51.279
around white women.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.780
Gotta eat sushi now.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.366
Yes to yoga.
Yes to farm‐to‐table.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.076
Yes to TED Talks.
Yes to Banksy.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.703
No to all other street art.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.620
You getting all this?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.247
Okay, wow.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.582
Now, if a cop stops you,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.792
that's its own list:

18:04.875 --> 18:06.085
Never run.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.504
No reaching.
No sudden movements.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.630
Little smile can't hurt.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.799
Compliment the cop.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.009
I like your tie, sir.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.344
What lovely eyes
you have.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.306
<i>♪ rock music ♪</i>

18:18.389 --> 18:22.393
<i>♪♪♪</i>

18:45.916 --> 18:47.543
This is all Debbie's?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.628
Debbie Gallagher's?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.296
[Mikey]
Yeah.

18:50.379 --> 18:54.342
Someone has a secret she‐shed
down by the seashore.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.093
I...

18:56.177 --> 18:58.429
It's like the moment
a‐a master forger

18:58.512 --> 19:00.431
sees his student's work
for the first time

19:00.514 --> 19:02.141
and recognizes her brilliance.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.060
What does she do,
re‐sell all this?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.020
She wears it
and returns it within

19:06.103 --> 19:10.358
30 days to get
a full cash refund.

19:10.441 --> 19:15.237
What a conniving,
nasty, little genius!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.865
And here I thought
she was a straight shooter.

19:17.948 --> 19:21.452
This requires real craft.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.913
I feel deep love for her.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.582
Grab the totes and clutches.
I'll grab the pumps.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.625
Let's bleed her dry.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.378
No, no, wait‐‐
well, hold on a second, Mikey.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.673
She earned all this
stolen shit fair and square.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.050
And I'm not a tyrant king,
am I?

19:36.133 --> 19:40.638
I want to be benevolent
and fair with my subjects.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.431
We'll only take the Gucci.

19:42.515 --> 19:46.977
Just enough to cover the ATM
mishap, plus interest.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.396
Your grace is a thing
of beauty, your grace.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.275
[Lori]
You missed a spot.

19:53.359 --> 19:53.401
Over there.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.615
[sighs]
Oh, yeah.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.201
That's the stuff.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.661
So, Carl.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.414
You've had some time
to unpack and settle in.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.331
I wanted to give you that.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.292
But I think it's time
we have a chat

20:10.376 --> 20:11.252
about our relationship now.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
You mean like
a performance review?

20:13.838 --> 20:14.797
'Cause I'm your employee?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.967
Carl.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.428
Carl, Carl, Carl.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.429
Lori, we can't.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.389
‐ The employee manual says‐‐
‐ [Lori] I‐‐

20:23.472 --> 20:25.808
I wrote the employee manual,
Carl.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.976
Oh, okay.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.769
Well, there's someone else.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.521
Who, Anne?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.065
I saw you checking out
that little gordita today.

20:33.149 --> 20:33.941
The new girl?
I wasn't checking her out.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.151
I have a girlfriend.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.903
The Navy girl
with the dumb truck?

20:37.987 --> 20:39.488
Yeah, and she's at
plebe summer.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.197
We're more serious than ever.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.783
Plus you're my boss.
And old.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.494
No more talking, Carl.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.788
Lori, please.
I love my girlfriend Kelly!

20:47.872 --> 20:49.582
[stammers]

20:49.665 --> 20:51.333
You know how to knock,
Gonzalez?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.502
Sorry.
We ran out of napkins.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.879
Didn't mean to interrupt.

20:57.631 --> 20:58.424
[Carl]
Jesus.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.847
Hey.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.807
All Gucci or Prada.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.476
All NWT.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.603
"New with tags."

21:10.686 --> 21:12.521
You like that term?
I just learned that.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.981
Where'd you get
all this shit from, Frank?

21:14.064 --> 21:16.358
Ask me no questions,
and I will tell you no lies.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.570
Can I get a Jamie neat double
with a Jamie back?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.781
Me too.
I gotta piss.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.658
I'll give you 50 bucks
for the bag, Frank.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.160
Oh, grow up, Kevin.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.871
There's $2,500 worth of goods
there.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.832
The Blue book's
over a grand.

21:31.916 --> 21:32.917
Make it a hundy?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.585
Done.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.507
[Tommy] That wasn't
a very good negosh, Kev.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.968
Watch and learn.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.929
All right, Frank.

21:45.012 --> 21:49.683
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.477
‐ I thank you.
‐ [Kevin] Except...

21:51.560 --> 21:53.437
you gotta pay your
outstanding Alibi tab.

21:53.521 --> 21:54.563
How much was that again, V?

21:54.647 --> 21:55.439
Infinity dollars.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.858
So this just goes
back to the house.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.652
Well, this is some tomfuckery!

21:59.735 --> 22:03.030
You're gonna take my goods
and leave me with zero?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.406
Correct.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.367
Kermit!
Tommy!

22:06.450 --> 22:08.202
You just gonna sit there
and let this happen?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.538
‐ We hate you, Frank.
‐ Yeah.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.289
[Mikey screams]

22:12.373 --> 22:13.332
Jeez.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.792
Sounds like he's in labor.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.126
Nah, he probably just
really needed to pee.

22:16.210 --> 22:19.880
[Mikey] Ow, fuck!
The burn!

22:19.964 --> 22:21.340
All right.
I'll go check on him.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.762
You doing okay in here, Mikey?

22:26.846 --> 22:27.888
‐ Yeah, yeah.
‐ Jeez.

22:27.972 --> 22:28.889
I'm okay.

22:28.973 --> 22:29.849
Here, give me your hand.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.060
[both grunt]

22:33.143 --> 22:34.562
You look a little moist there,
my friend.

22:34.645 --> 22:35.563
What's wrong?

22:35.646 --> 22:36.564
What's the date?

22:36.647 --> 22:36.939
I don't know.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.234
June? Ish?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.193
Do I look a little yellow
to you, Frank?

22:41.277 --> 22:44.113
Mustard‐y,
now that you mention it.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.865
I got to get to the vet.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.075
To the vet?

22:48.158 --> 22:49.994
Beaks, Whiskers & Snouts
Animal Hospital

22:50.077 --> 22:52.454
on West Ellis.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.622
Ask for Dr. Drew.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.832
Tell him you got a husky.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.877
Did you take something you
should've been sharing with me?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.671
Quickly, Francine.

23:00.754 --> 23:01.755
Before I get wacky!

23:01.839 --> 23:03.090
Okay.
Okay, okay.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.091
You're a husky.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.134
Dr. Drew.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.093
Yeah.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.053
You stay with me, Mikey.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.890
Hey, you free at the moment?

23:10.973 --> 23:13.475
What kinda dumb
fucking question is that?

23:15.519 --> 23:16.812
I think we need to have a talk.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.315
About?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.774
About what we're gonna do.

23:20.858 --> 23:21.859
About?

23:21.942 --> 23:24.445
Parole, Mickey.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.531
About me getting out
and you, well, not.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.952
Do we do long distance
or no distance,

23:32.036 --> 23:34.622
marriage, kids,

23:34.705 --> 23:36.707
or‐‐or, uh, retirement?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.500
‐ What are you talking about?
‐ I don't fucking know!

23:38.584 --> 23:40.127
Apparently we were
supposed to have a talk

23:40.210 --> 23:42.713
a while ago
but just never got the memo.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.632
What memo?

23:44.715 --> 23:47.968
Well, do you or do you not

23:48.052 --> 23:49.970
want to be in a long‐distance
relationship when I'm out?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.388
No.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.766
What is this,
a fucking rom‐com movie?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.267
If you're out there, you're
gonna be fucking other people;

23:55.351 --> 23:56.226
so will I.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.811
No long‐distance.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.314
Can't we just, like,
wait for each other?

24:00.397 --> 24:02.483
So, great, now we're in
a fuckin' horror movie?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.985
Look, it would be
one thing if

24:05.069 --> 24:07.154
you felt differently
about leaving,

24:07.237 --> 24:07.988
but you don't.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.698
What does that mean?

24:09.782 --> 24:13.869
It means if there was a part
of you that felt maybe

24:13.953 --> 24:15.704
you owed it to me
to throw your‐‐

24:15.788 --> 24:18.499
to throw your parole hearing
so that you could stay in here

24:18.582 --> 24:20.960
because I threw my whole
fuckin' life away

24:21.043 --> 24:22.169
getting tossed in here
to be with you,

24:22.252 --> 24:23.671
then we'd at least be having
a different conversation‐‐

24:23.754 --> 24:25.130
I didn't ask you
to do that for me.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.966
No, I just did it 'cause
it was the right thing.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.550
You want me to tank
my parole hearing on purpose

24:28.634 --> 24:29.969
so I'm stuck in prison
with you?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.512
I'm not asking you for shit,
Gallagher.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.347
You want me to choose to do it
without you asking.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.975
I want you to want to do
what you want.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.478
But if I choose it,
you would be happy.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.437
I just want to know, yes or no.
Would you be fucking happy?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.690
‐ Yes, fuck, yes.
‐ Then I'll do it.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.192
I'll fuck up my hearing
so that I can stay with you.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.987
If that's what you want, fine.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.948
‐ Yeah, fine.
‐ Good.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.908
Good.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.079
[Liam]
<i>Hey, V, guess what.</i>

24:57.162 --> 24:58.789
I have a new black uncle.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.500
‐ You do?
‐ His name's MaVar.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.626
He's great.

25:02.710 --> 25:03.377
He's taking me
to the Sox/Cubs game.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.879
Wait a second.
Who is this guy?

25:05.963 --> 25:06.422
Used car salesman.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.382
Lives down the street.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.718
Used car salesman?
That's code for shady.

25:10.801 --> 25:11.885
He married?

25:11.969 --> 25:12.386
Got kids of his own?

25:12.469 --> 25:13.303
I think he's gay.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.723
And he dresses real slick.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.266
[phone chimes]

25:17.349 --> 25:19.685
He says I can bring a friend.

25:19.768 --> 25:20.728
Wanna come?

25:20.811 --> 25:21.979
No.
And neither should you.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.022
Stranger danger.

25:23.105 --> 25:23.731
V, you should go.

25:23.814 --> 25:24.523
You were just talking about

25:24.606 --> 25:26.483
how you need to
make new friends.

25:26.567 --> 25:27.276
And I think
a little gayboy car salesman

25:27.359 --> 25:29.278
sounds perfect for you.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.904
[Kermit]
My mom loves hers.

25:30.988 --> 25:31.989
Found him at Toyota.

25:32.072 --> 25:32.614
And it's the Cubs/Sox game.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.199
What do you have to lose?

25:38.412 --> 25:40.080
Fellow welders.

25:40.164 --> 25:43.333
Thank you all for joining me
and union Jerry here

25:43.417 --> 25:45.753
in this neutral,
non‐work‐related location.

25:45.836 --> 25:46.920
Have you all got fries?

25:47.004 --> 25:49.131
Perfect.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.132
I've done some Googling,

25:50.215 --> 25:52.092
and I've gotta warn you:

25:52.176 --> 25:54.970
what I'm about to say
is triggering.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.556
The plumbers get Easter off.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.599
They get Veterans Day off,

25:58.682 --> 26:00.392
Memorial Day, Labor Day,

26:00.476 --> 26:02.644
Fourth of July,
their birthdays,

26:02.728 --> 26:05.064
and get this:
Columbus Day,

26:05.147 --> 26:06.815
Farhad, take a wild guess.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.527
How many paid weeks off do you
think they get at Christmas?

26:10.611 --> 26:11.528
One?

26:11.612 --> 26:13.030
Three.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.699
Two for Christmas,
one for Hanukkah/Kwanzaa.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.409
They get sick days.

26:17.493 --> 26:21.080
They get dental,
including orthodontia.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.082
Look at this bitch.
