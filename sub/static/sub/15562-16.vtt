00:01.726 --> 00:04.228
The roach situation in the
break room is getting worse.

00:04.280 --> 00:05.727
So clean up your crumbs, and Heather,

00:06.139 --> 00:07.754
stop hording yogurt lids in your locker.

00:07.817 --> 00:09.583
You're not gonna win that free cruise.

00:09.651 --> 00:12.088
On to something more important
than a bunch of dumb bugs.

00:12.687 --> 00:15.719
Who's excited about awards season?

00:16.291 --> 00:17.857
Um, Glenn, the Oscars were last month.

00:17.926 --> 00:20.660
I know that, because we
had that Oscar pool.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.328
Wait, who won that again?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.596
I believe that was you.

00:23.665 --> 00:25.632
Oh, yeah, that was me.

00:26.168 --> 00:27.385
It's all about the technical categories.

00:27.387 --> 00:28.146
Yep, you said that.

00:28.147 --> 00:29.643
Forget about the Oscars.

00:29.704 --> 00:33.818
I am talking about the new
Cloud 9 Integrity Awards.

00:34.881 --> 00:36.923
I know, right? So cool.

00:37.017 --> 00:40.275
The winner from each store
gets an unframed certificate,

00:40.276 --> 00:43.169
and attends a luncheon
with an all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:43.201 --> 00:45.862
Wait, hold on.
So you go through the buffet,

00:45.864 --> 00:47.592
and fill your plate once,
and that's all you get?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.427
No, it's all-you-can-eat.

00:49.866 --> 00:52.698
Anyway, uh, the recommendation
forms are here, and...

00:52.766 --> 00:54.799
which Brett will be happy
to help you with...

00:54.868 --> 00:56.901
in case you think of
someone you work with,

00:56.970 --> 00:59.713
or maybe work for,

00:59.783 --> 01:02.607
who you think has shown
integrity in the workplace.

01:02.675 --> 01:04.911
You can't push yourself for an award.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.713
Me? I don't even know
if managers are eligible.

01:07.781 --> 01:09.147
Oh, yeah, they're probably not.

01:09.215 --> 01:11.049
Well, I know they are,
because I checked, so...

01:11.117 --> 01:13.050
Oh, I see, so it's all you can eat

01:13.129 --> 01:14.734
on your one trip to the buffet.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.621
No, you're... you're not getting it.

01:16.689 --> 01:19.590
It... it's multiple trips.
That... that's the beauty of it.

01:19.877 --> 01:22.511
Well, I'm probably not eligible,
since I'm dating Jeff.

01:22.588 --> 01:25.688
You know, I wouldn't want to add
more drama to the scandal, or

01:25.689 --> 01:27.560
add gasoline to the fire, right?

01:30.570 --> 01:34.448
You were all so interested
when you thought Sandra was dating Jeff.

01:34.496 --> 01:36.296
Yeah, it just feels kinda done now.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.363
Yeah.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.020
What size plate
do you have to bring with you?

01:39.301 --> 01:41.234
They have plates there.

01:42.635 --> 01:45.876
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:46.174 --> 01:48.474
So Jeff's kind of a bigwig, huh?

01:48.543 --> 01:49.409
I heard when he drives somewhere,

01:49.477 --> 01:50.977
Cloud 9 pays for his gas.

01:51.046 --> 01:53.346
Oh, well, they pay
for his haircuts too, so...

01:53.415 --> 01:55.014
- That's awesome.
- Hm.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.983
Uh, anyway, you know,
I put in six requests

01:57.052 --> 01:58.785
for an exterminator
for that roach problem,

01:58.853 --> 02:00.019
and then it occurred to me,

02:00.088 --> 02:02.655
maybe Jeff could help grease the wheels.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.277
You want me to talk to Jeff?

02:04.755 --> 02:06.789
I don't know, Dina, it's...

02:06.791 --> 02:07.868
Oh, sorry.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.219
I just thought he was really into you.

02:10.632 --> 02:12.131
He is.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.989
He's obsessed with me.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.935
I'm all, "What do you
wanna have for dinner?"

02:16.004 --> 02:18.481
He's like, "Mateo, I'm
obsessed with you."

02:18.940 --> 02:21.708
Uh-huh, well, if you wanna prove it,

02:21.776 --> 02:22.828
why don't you give him a ring?

02:22.912 --> 02:24.244
I mean, if he's obsessed with you.

02:24.586 --> 02:25.274
Mm-hmm.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.411
The primary circuit supplies
the secondary portion

02:28.516 --> 02:29.882
of the valve with air.

02:29.951 --> 02:32.518
Pump the brakes to demonstrate.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.555
- What you doing?
- Um, I am making a delivery.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.323
Since when do you make deliveries?

02:37.392 --> 02:38.691
Uh... Since I realized

02:38.760 --> 02:42.095
we don't have any female
truck drivers in 2017.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.099
Okay, I'm helping my parents move.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.400
- Ah...
- They forgot to rent a truck,

02:47.502 --> 02:49.135
and they have to be
out of their house today.

02:50.813 --> 02:52.045
Uh...

02:52.389 --> 02:54.055
Okay, if you need some help,

02:54.124 --> 02:55.857
I actually know how to drive stick.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.293
I thought it would be something
that would impress women.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.594
It does not.

02:59.663 --> 03:01.830
Uh, nope, I'm fine. Thank you.

03:01.898 --> 03:03.411
All right.

03:03.614 --> 03:05.681
Yeah, you got this.

03:06.223 --> 03:08.056
- Okay, fine, you can help.
- Aww...

03:08.125 --> 03:10.191
enough with the gratitude.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.994
Okay, hitting the road.

03:13.063 --> 03:16.097
No limits, no rules.

03:19.136 --> 03:21.042
I like to be right up on the wheel.

03:22.239 --> 03:23.993
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hey.

03:24.087 --> 03:25.887
Would it be okay if I recommended you

03:25.944 --> 03:27.550
for the Integrity Award?

03:28.892 --> 03:31.392
What? Me?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.595
Huh?

03:33.663 --> 03:34.916
You... are you sure?

03:35.056 --> 03:37.100
Yeah, you're such a good guy.

03:37.131 --> 03:38.377
But if you're uncomfortable with it...

03:38.446 --> 03:40.334
- No, no. Do it, do it.
- Okay...

03:40.453 --> 03:42.772
well, I'm gonna put it
in the ballot box.

03:42.788 --> 03:45.317
Yeah, okay.
Whatever you decide, you know.

03:45.386 --> 03:46.552
My middle name's Phillip

03:46.620 --> 03:49.088
Okay.

03:49.156 --> 03:52.157
I would like 44 crab legs, please.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.593 --> 04:03.654
I'm sorry, if I show you
special treatment,

04:03.686 --> 04:05.261
people are going to
start asking questions.

04:05.262 --> 04:08.262
There's nothing I can do. I gotta go.

04:08.330 --> 04:09.187
Was that Jeff?

04:10.199 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, I asked him about
the exterminator, and...

04:13.068 --> 04:15.002
I knew it. As the internet would say,

04:15.070 --> 04:17.204
"you can no haz cheeseburger."
Forget it.

04:17.273 --> 04:19.039
No, no, he, um...

04:19.108 --> 04:20.841
Is sending somebody right away.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.210
I told you, he's obsessed with me.

04:23.279 --> 04:26.446
Oh, you really need to
work on your good news voice.

04:26.515 --> 04:27.848
I have a series of tapes I can lend you.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.082
They're very helpful.

04:29.151 --> 04:30.784
For example...

04:30.853 --> 04:33.654
"Grandma's alive!" No, no, hold on.

04:33.722 --> 04:35.489
"Grandma's alive!"

04:35.558 --> 04:36.790
No, that's not sounding right either.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.592
I'll find it. It's just...

04:38.661 --> 04:40.427
news I would never be happy to give.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.397
Hey, Sandra.

04:43.465 --> 04:44.965
Hey, how was your vacation?

04:45.034 --> 04:47.201
- I didn't take one.
- No, I meant last year,

04:47.269 --> 04:49.870
when I gave you that week off
to go to Atlantic City.

04:49.939 --> 04:52.673
- Oh...
- Don't worry about it.

04:52.741 --> 04:54.608
So who you nominating?

04:54.677 --> 04:58.045
- You.
- What? Me?

04:58.113 --> 05:01.148
No... Sandra, that's so...

05:01.217 --> 05:03.150
You know, that is so out of leftfield.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.238
Watch out! Watch out!

05:04.239 --> 05:06.118
Move, move
Coming through, coming through.

05:06.188 --> 05:06.974
What's going on?

05:06.990 --> 05:08.821
Found this dog outside...
stuck in the snow.

05:08.905 --> 05:10.657
- Oh, my God, is he okay?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

05:10.676 --> 05:11.683
I just need to warm him up quick.

05:11.744 --> 05:14.176
Hey, Tim, go grab one of those dog
baths, bring him to the men's room.

05:14.177 --> 05:17.030
Heather, grab some hairdryers,
blankets, and towels.

05:17.156 --> 05:19.289
Come on, little buddy. I got you.

05:19.358 --> 05:21.491
- Thank God Garrett was there.
- Yeah.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.983
Talk about integrity.

05:27.199 --> 05:31.068
Uh, I... I don't... I don't think
you're allowed to erase.

05:32.738 --> 05:34.771
I'm so excited to meet the parents.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.107
Trying to decide
if I should ask my questions

05:37.176 --> 05:38.842
in chronological order from birth,

05:38.911 --> 05:41.478
or by degree of embarrassment.

05:41.547 --> 05:43.914
Oh, Jonah, so sweet, so dumb.

05:43.983 --> 05:46.116
Do you actually think I'd bring you
along if my parents were here?

05:46.194 --> 05:48.845
They're in the new place.
We're just getting boxes.

05:51.237 --> 05:52.298
Hey, princess.

05:53.001 --> 05:54.729
We're a little behind schedule.

05:55.303 --> 05:57.725
- A little?
- Hi, I'm Jonah,

05:57.788 --> 05:59.807
and I have a lot of questions.

06:02.243 --> 06:03.610
Why aren't you guys packed?

06:03.856 --> 06:05.397
It's an emotional process.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.034
Amelia, you made this in preschool.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.933
- Amelia?
- Uh, stay in your lane.

06:10.934 --> 06:11.933
I'm already packed.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.845
Took me two minutes
to box up everything I own.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.539
Let's see. Uh, this is mostly socks,

06:18.608 --> 06:21.476
a toothbrush, and a banana.

06:21.806 --> 06:23.840
I keep it simple. What else do I need?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.408
I don't know, maybe your heart medicine,

06:25.477 --> 06:28.019
so that your body
doesn't reject your new valve?

06:28.780 --> 06:29.401
Yep.

06:31.883 --> 06:34.484
Look, I'm gonna need to stay.
Can you Uber back?

06:34.559 --> 06:37.248
Oh, n-n-no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.555
This is where I need to be, Amelia...

06:39.788 --> 06:41.145
You know what, Connie?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.692
Let's start with those photo albums.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.860
What do ya say?

06:43.928 --> 06:46.162
- Sit.
- Okay.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.730
All right, now I'm gonna
give you one more,

06:47.799 --> 06:49.229
'cause I'm looking out for your sodium.

06:49.322 --> 06:50.988
- Here you go.
- Hey, Garrett.

06:51.112 --> 06:52.578
Hey there, little guy. How's your...

06:53.194 --> 06:54.954
Oh, he thinks you're trying
to steal his nacho.

06:55.336 --> 06:55.881
Oh...

06:57.131 --> 06:58.263
I'm not.

06:59.141 --> 07:01.608
Anyway, good for you for finding him.

07:01.677 --> 07:03.243
You probably saved his life.

07:03.763 --> 07:05.278
Hm, who saw that coming?

07:05.347 --> 07:06.146
I didn't.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.170
Eh, you know, it wasn't that big a deal.

07:08.186 --> 07:09.786
You might even win the award.

07:09.855 --> 07:13.690
How crazy would that be?
Garrett, Integrity Award winner.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.994
Look, I know how much
you want the award.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.697
Whoa! That's quite a leap.

07:20.996 --> 07:24.063
Well, on the off chance that I'm
right, why don't we do this?

07:24.132 --> 07:25.832
Attention, Cloud 9 employees,

07:25.900 --> 07:27.900
do not recommend me
for the Integrity Award.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.236
If you would like to reward
me for rescuing a dog,

07:30.305 --> 07:32.572
feel free to bring baked goods
by Customer Service,

07:32.641 --> 07:34.907
preferably homemade.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.576
Thank you.

07:36.645 --> 07:38.323
And no lemon squares,
or anything with oatmeal.

07:38.324 --> 07:41.067
Save that crap for somebody
who did not rescue a dog.

07:41.138 --> 07:43.653
My cousin's actually
an exterminator up in Davenport.

07:43.654 --> 07:44.920
Name's Rob. You know him?

07:45.222 --> 07:46.922
- Uh-uh.
- Eh, worth a shot.

07:46.978 --> 07:48.056
Would've been cool.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.154
All right, everyone out.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.861
Break room is officially
closed for fumigation.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.796
This stuff is highly toxic.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.091
Sandra, stay or go. I really don't care.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.334
All right, bug man, room is yours.

07:59.403 --> 08:00.735
Go to town.

08:05.509 --> 08:07.422
Oh, okay, NBD.

08:07.744 --> 08:09.344
Just a few roachies.

08:10.414 --> 08:12.885
I mean, ah.

08:14.184 --> 08:15.385
Come at me, bro.

08:16.153 --> 08:17.152
Oh...

08:17.563 --> 08:20.004
she said the other kids
were wearing capes at school.

08:20.145 --> 08:22.335
Then I picked her up one day. Nope.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.269
Okay, Mom, I was coping
with Grandpa dying in my arms.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.193
And you know what,
why don't you guys get packing?

08:28.262 --> 08:30.829
If you wanna chit-chat,
exchange numbers.

08:30.898 --> 08:32.264
Already Facebook friends.

08:32.332 --> 08:35.200
So next we have...

08:35.269 --> 08:36.779
oh, naked Amy.

08:36.842 --> 08:37.404
Mom...

08:37.471 --> 08:39.071
Please, you were three years old.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.673
Don't worry, I only saw up-top stuff...

08:40.741 --> 08:41.974
nothing south of the border.

08:42.043 --> 08:42.975
Kay, you're not making it better.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.387
Oh, I didn't mean that
in, like, a Latino way.

08:46.347 --> 08:49.925
Hey, Dad, you know,
Jonah is a real art lover.

08:51.152 --> 08:53.071
- Oh.
- Oh, really?

08:54.689 --> 08:56.705
Powerful, aren't they?

08:57.692 --> 08:59.058
Yeah... yeah, yeah,

08:59.126 --> 09:02.061
you have a... a real
eye for composition.

09:02.129 --> 09:03.595
They're celebrities.

09:03.664 --> 09:05.397
Yeah. Yeah, I caught that.

09:05.466 --> 09:06.999
I knew you'd appreciate them.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.802
- Yeah...
- Pick your favorite one.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.603
Oh, me? No, no, no. Come on, I couldn't.

09:11.672 --> 09:13.188
No, no, no, I insist.

09:13.774 --> 09:15.908
I don't have room for them
anyway in the new place.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.476
Oh, okay, thanks.

09:17.545 --> 09:20.512
Um, yeah, I'll... I'll take,
you know, Putin.

09:20.581 --> 09:22.414
- Why?
- Well, I...

09:22.483 --> 09:24.550
that's just because... I mean,
I... I'll take any of them.

09:24.618 --> 09:27.739
No, no, no, no, fine.
You want Putin, take him.

09:28.122 --> 09:30.289
Thank you. This, uh... this mean a lot.

09:30.357 --> 09:33.502
Let's say, um... $30 sound fair?

09:34.929 --> 09:37.296
Yeah... yeah, $30's... $30's cool.

09:37.364 --> 09:38.897
$30's good. Yeah.

09:38.966 --> 09:40.099
Hey, Cheyenne.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.134
I was just reading your recommendation.

09:42.203 --> 09:43.936
It is so nice.

09:44.004 --> 09:44.894
Oh, thanks.

09:45.539 --> 09:47.172
But three sentences?

09:47.241 --> 09:50.409
Can I really be summed up
in three sentences?

09:50.478 --> 09:52.010
Oh, should it be longer?

09:52.079 --> 09:52.629
Well...

09:53.914 --> 09:56.815
I'm just wondering if we
could up the wow factor.

09:56.884 --> 09:58.250
I mean, it's not about making it longer.

09:58.319 --> 10:01.053
It's about making it better and longer.

10:01.122 --> 10:04.189
So do you want me to write another one?

10:04.258 --> 10:06.825
I think you want you
to write another one.

10:06.894 --> 10:08.827
- That's what I'm hearing.
- Oh, okay.

10:08.896 --> 10:10.963
I'll do it as soon as I'm done
with this customer.

10:11.031 --> 10:12.030
Oh, I'll take over,

10:12.577 --> 10:14.645
so... so you can get to it
while it's fresh in your head.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.227
- What is?
- I can't wait to find out.

10:17.582 --> 10:20.216
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:20.808 --> 10:21.476
Hi.

10:22.685 --> 10:25.021
Are you ready to be your best self?

10:29.094 --> 10:30.793
Okay.

10:37.802 --> 10:38.506
That's it?

10:52.534 --> 10:53.516
Hey, there you are.

10:54.201 --> 10:55.634
The exterminator was here.
You just missed him.

10:55.702 --> 10:58.570
Oh, yeah, I saw him. Really skinny guy.

10:58.639 --> 10:59.371
Huh, I didn't think so.

10:59.546 --> 11:00.874
Well, you can't tell in a jumpsuit.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.049
Anyway, thanks for making Jeff send him.

11:03.049 --> 11:04.172
Sure. I'm a good man to know,

11:04.172 --> 11:05.271
so let me know
if you need anything else.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.000
Cool. Well, I'd love to get

11:07.069 --> 11:08.869
the bulbs changed in the parking lights.

11:08.937 --> 11:10.037
Kitchen needs to be re-grouted.

11:10.105 --> 11:12.939
- Utility room's a mess.
- Okay...

11:13.008 --> 11:14.908
seems like a lot to ask all at once.

11:14.977 --> 11:18.111
Come on now, you just need to
make it worth his while, right?

11:18.180 --> 11:21.171
Bedroom-wise? Kitchen-wise?
Dungeon-wise?

11:21.717 --> 11:23.208
Whatever it is you guys do.

11:23.686 --> 11:25.666
This would just really help me out.

11:26.588 --> 11:28.889
- Okay, sure, no problem.
- Great.

11:28.957 --> 11:30.757
Let me know if you need
any good sex moves.

11:30.826 --> 11:32.559
Nope, I'm good.

11:32.628 --> 11:33.827
You're gonna wanna take
his whole mess of parts,

11:33.896 --> 11:35.829
and just twist 'em up fast, okay?

11:35.898 --> 11:37.597
Like a... like a windup toy.

11:37.666 --> 11:40.167
Uh, pretend it's a jar
of pickles that won't open.

11:40.235 --> 11:42.965
Excuse you, this is a
private conversation.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.474
Okay someone's ready for the dance.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.990
Hi, boy! Hi.

11:48.992 --> 11:50.900
I was looking everywhere for him.

11:51.469 --> 11:53.280
Aww, hi, boy.

11:53.348 --> 11:55.015
Oh, what's going on here?

11:55.084 --> 11:56.416
Garrett didn't just find a dog.

11:56.485 --> 11:58.285
He found a veteran's dog.

11:58.353 --> 12:00.187
Thank you. You're a hero.

12:00.255 --> 12:02.189
Oh, no, sir, thank you.
You're the real hero here.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.451
- You are.
- Well, okay, I'll take it.

12:05.961 --> 12:07.461
Maybe we all are.

12:07.529 --> 12:09.487
All of us are heroes.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.000
Connie, you have more necklaces

12:14.069 --> 12:16.737
made out of coins than I have ever seen.

12:16.805 --> 12:18.644
Until now, the record was zero.

12:20.129 --> 12:21.102
I'm hungry.

12:21.643 --> 12:23.076
Connie, I'm hungry.

12:23.145 --> 12:26.580
Okay, I will order pizza, and we will
keep packing until it gets here.

12:26.648 --> 12:27.380
Pizza?

12:27.591 --> 12:29.382
This is our last meal in this house.

12:29.451 --> 12:31.685
We can't just eat junk
out of a cardboard box?

12:31.754 --> 12:33.820
- I mean, we could.
- I'll make tamales.

12:33.889 --> 12:35.589
- Ooh, that sounds good...
- Oh, yeah.

12:35.657 --> 12:36.823
But so does pizza.

12:36.892 --> 12:38.953
Mom, we don't have twelve hours
for you to make tamales.

12:38.954 --> 12:39.534
I'll hurry.

12:39.883 --> 12:41.046
I just have to find that steamer.

12:41.047 --> 12:43.535
Mom, please, no.
Don't... do not open that...

12:43.590 --> 12:44.914
I just packed...

12:45.670 --> 12:46.454
I can't.

12:50.409 --> 12:54.113
Jonah, I'm feeling like
$30 was a little low.

13:00.682 --> 13:02.663
So all of us at corporate
would like to congratulate you

13:02.664 --> 13:04.970
on some find work today.
Really impressive.

13:04.971 --> 13:06.603
Ah, just doing what I do.

13:06.665 --> 13:10.700
Plus, my manager, Glenn Sturgis,
set such a great example for me.

13:10.769 --> 13:11.968
Right, but you're the one who saved

13:12.037 --> 13:13.436
the life of a war hero's dog.

13:13.505 --> 13:14.904
I mean, that deserves recognition.

13:14.973 --> 13:16.005
Well, hold on.

13:16.376 --> 13:19.389
I think you mean allegedly saved a life

13:19.757 --> 13:22.233
- of an alleged dog.
- It was definitely a dog.

13:22.289 --> 13:25.489
And who knows if that guy
was even a real war hero.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.675
Maybe he was one of those veterans

13:27.744 --> 13:30.478
that, you know, shot up
a village of innocent people.

13:30.547 --> 13:33.415
Lot of folks snap under the fog of war.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.116
What are you doing?

13:35.185 --> 13:37.218
Um, well... I'm not sure how...

13:37.287 --> 13:38.553
Garrett just called you a bad name,

13:38.622 --> 13:40.522
and now he's giving you the finger

13:41.958 --> 13:43.324
Attention, Cloud 9 employees,

13:43.393 --> 13:45.293
I am now accepting recommendations

13:45.362 --> 13:46.599
for the Integrity Award,

13:46.599 --> 13:49.151
not because I care,
but largely out of spite.

13:51.379 --> 13:54.498
Hey, uh, so I'm not
exactly sure what this means,

13:54.498 --> 13:56.365
but your mom said,
"You better come down.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.663
You're not too big to get the chancla"?

13:59.303 --> 14:01.403
She's threatening
to throw her sandal at me.

14:01.472 --> 14:03.038
Why? Did she have it out?

14:03.107 --> 14:05.992
Wait, is this your childhood bedroom?

14:06.310 --> 14:08.488
Yeah, take in all the glory.

14:08.489 --> 14:11.691
So this is where it all
began for young Amelia.

14:11.759 --> 14:13.492
Lets see here.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.929
Oh, not one, but two, three...

14:16.998 --> 14:20.032
six pictures of Scott Wolf.

14:20.481 --> 14:22.602
Yeah, I was part of the Wolf Pack.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.238
Hey, is this... Is this "Rent"?

14:25.306 --> 14:27.427
I never pictured you as a...
a theater nerd.

14:27.428 --> 14:28.307
I was one too.

14:28.376 --> 14:29.950
Yeah, that's exactly how I pictured you.

14:29.950 --> 14:33.010
Oh! And I was on
the debate team as well.

14:33.221 --> 14:36.318
I feel like if we went to school
together, we would've been friends.

14:36.496 --> 14:40.620
Um, I'd like to think not,
but, yeah, probably.

14:40.699 --> 14:42.524
This was not just a crush...

14:44.281 --> 14:45.814
there's a darkness here.

15:00.664 --> 15:01.493
Okay.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.334
I think it's, like, the longest
thing I've ever written.

15:06.403 --> 15:08.603
First time I wrote "opportunity."

15:08.672 --> 15:09.951
That word's nuts.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.319
Yeah, well, I...
I think we're getting there.

15:12.484 --> 15:15.221
But I still think we need,
like, a big story here.

15:15.822 --> 15:18.491
Like, what is my dog-in-the-snow?

15:18.962 --> 15:20.725
Oh, remember that one time

15:20.794 --> 15:22.404
that you stopped that shopping cart

15:22.428 --> 15:24.362
from smashing into aisle six?

15:24.430 --> 15:25.725
Yeah, like that,

15:26.332 --> 15:29.901
but what if aisle six was a baby,

15:29.969 --> 15:32.679
and the shopping cart was,
like, an axe murderer?

15:33.172 --> 15:36.727
So you want me to lie
to get you an Integrity Award?

15:37.277 --> 15:41.379
What I'm hearing is that
you want you to lie

15:41.447 --> 15:43.281
to get me an Integrity Award.

15:53.092 --> 15:54.926
But the worst part about the chanclas

15:54.994 --> 15:56.694
is if you duck the first one...

15:56.763 --> 15:58.329
There's another one.

15:58.398 --> 15:59.111
Exactly.

15:59.181 --> 15:59.878
Right.

16:00.324 --> 16:00.976
Hon,

16:00.977 --> 16:02.943
would you like two or three tamales?

16:03.012 --> 16:04.545
What the hell are you
doing with my daughter?

16:04.613 --> 16:05.880
- Whoa, whoa.
- I'll kill you.

16:05.928 --> 16:07.756
No, no, no, no, no, sir.
No, not... it's not...

16:07.758 --> 16:10.272
I'm kidding. Look at him freaking out.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.679
It's still hilarious, Dad.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.234
Your cousins are downstairs.

16:13.499 --> 16:14.898
Steven's girlfriend is very loud.

16:14.967 --> 16:15.865
I told you.

16:15.865 --> 16:17.398
I'm going to the store to get some ice.

16:17.465 --> 16:22.035
No, Dad, we don't need ice.
We need you to pack your stuff.

16:22.103 --> 16:23.970
This is never gonna get done.

16:24.445 --> 16:27.140
I'm so sick of having to do
everything for them.

16:27.708 --> 16:28.716
Then don't.

16:29.010 --> 16:30.709
- Come on.
- No, I-I-I mean it.

16:30.778 --> 16:33.751
What... what would happen
if you just left right now?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.039
Then I would be the one who had
to deal with the consequences.

16:36.039 --> 16:37.288
No, you would be the one

16:37.340 --> 16:39.390
who decided to deal
with the consequences,

16:39.438 --> 16:41.204
instead of just letting
them deal with it.

16:41.273 --> 16:44.141
I'm just saying, it's
not your responsibility

16:44.209 --> 16:46.959
to make sure that everything
goes well for everybody else.

16:49.014 --> 16:49.470
Yeah.

16:50.883 --> 16:51.674
You're right.

16:52.351 --> 16:54.498
They're grownups. They'll figure it out.

16:55.421 --> 16:58.388
Okay. Great, let's get out of here.

16:58.457 --> 17:00.457
Okay, let's go.

17:00.526 --> 17:02.692
Oh, like tha... Oh, like, out that way?

17:02.761 --> 17:04.161
Oh, yeah, I'm not dealing
with my cousins.

17:04.229 --> 17:06.317
It's like non-stop Dr. Evil impressions.

17:06.832 --> 17:09.266
Excuse me, do you have
anymore bug bombs in back?

17:09.334 --> 17:11.568
There's only one left, and I
have to do my whole house.

17:11.637 --> 17:13.369
Oh... One's all you need for a house.

17:13.439 --> 17:15.305
Three of them would fill
a Scottrade Center.

17:24.593 --> 17:27.874
You really schlonged me
with this whole dog scam.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.341
Well, that's a low blow.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.110
But since I'm a man of...

17:31.177 --> 17:33.011
Integrity, I'm gonna let it slide.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.366
Why are you doing this?

17:34.366 --> 17:37.016
You You You don't even
care about this award.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.284
Why do you assume that I don't care?

17:39.352 --> 17:42.387
One time I do a good deed,
I'd like a little recognition.

17:42.455 --> 17:44.384
I like plaques. I got walls.

17:45.158 --> 17:48.126
- Are you crying?
- Yeah! I got feelings, too,

17:48.194 --> 17:50.061
although not such strong feelings

17:50.130 --> 17:52.730
that I should be crying. That's weird.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.784
Okay, this is our store today.

17:55.852 --> 17:58.086
Here's where I'd like to
see it in three months.

17:58.573 --> 18:00.473
Fresh coat of paint,
advanced security system.

18:00.541 --> 18:03.067
You can tell Jeff whatever they have
at the Tel Aviv airport will be fine.

18:03.068 --> 18:05.784
Now here's where I'd like
to see it in three years.

18:05.784 --> 18:08.017
Enough! I'm not your slave, okay?

18:08.086 --> 18:11.054
Uh, I mean, Jeff's not.

18:11.122 --> 18:13.389
Jeff's... Jeff's not
gonna do any of those.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.520
What is going on?

Oh, that's not great.

I feel sick. I feel sick.

18:39.709 --> 18:43.653
Yeah, as boys, we're told
to keep our feelings inside.

18:43.722 --> 18:45.588
But this is good.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.757
I'm crying, you're crying.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.425

19:07.217 --> 19:10.188
Whoa, what is going on?

19:10.882 --> 19:13.578
I don't know, but looks
like kind of a mess.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.140
You know, they're adults.

19:17.722 --> 19:20.556
I'm sure they can handle it.
Whatever it is.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.006
You know, we never did get lunch.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.594
Gotta eat.

19:32.937 --> 19:34.103
Oh, no, not here, sir.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.139
We have a...

19:38.651 --> 19:40.112
What percentage oxygen you using?

19:40.175 --> 19:41.510
Standard 80?

19:41.579 --> 19:42.612
Yeah.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.680
So some moron decided to set off

19:50.728 --> 19:53.189
ten industrial-sized bug
bombs in your break room.

19:53.662 --> 19:54.957
Oh, I'm sure he was just trying to help.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.958
Or she! Whoever it is.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.961
Hey, so, uh, early dinner tonight?

20:00.327 --> 20:02.961
- What are you doing?
- Huh? Oh, it's fine.

20:03.058 --> 20:04.476
I... I came clean.

20:04.563 --> 20:07.036
I mean, the secret
was just inflaming my ulcer.

20:08.438 --> 20:10.873
- And they're okay with it?
- Yeah, it's fine.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.669
It's... it's basically fine.

20:14.758 --> 20:17.327
You need to transfer
to a different store.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.827
Transfer?

20:21.619 --> 20:22.399
Oh.

20:24.948 --> 20:27.243
Why can't I just have a car?

20:27.346 --> 20:29.025
I don't know. You just can't.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.420
No, see, the thing is "Party of Five"

20:32.489 --> 20:34.883
showcased his boyish appeal,
but it made it harder for him

20:34.884 --> 20:36.783
to get darker, more adult roles.

20:36.851 --> 20:37.884
I wonder what he's doing now.

20:38.393 --> 20:40.521
He married Kelly from
"THE REAL WORLD: New Orleans."

20:40.523 --> 20:42.922
They live in Park City
with their three kids.

20:44.192 --> 20:46.059
Whose names are...

20:46.127 --> 20:47.742
How would I know?

20:49.064 --> 20:50.363
Jackson, Miller, and Lucy.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.137
Okay, so who was your '90s crush?

20:58.206 --> 21:00.807
Alyssa Jayne Milano was born
in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn...

21:00.875 --> 21:02.742
Of course it was Alyssa Jayne Milano!

21:02.811 --> 21:04.277
In 1972.
