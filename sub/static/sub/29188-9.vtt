Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:10.053 --> 00:11.576
BETH ANN:
I used to play the piano.

00:11.620 --> 00:15.015
Do you still play?My husband didn't care
for my playing.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.626
Our daughter died
because of me.

00:17.669 --> 00:20.063
I'm the one who's responsible.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.631
It seems I only have
six months to live.

00:22.674 --> 00:23.936
Six months!

00:23.980 --> 00:25.634
I thought a clean break
was just better for...

00:25.677 --> 00:26.765
I'm pregnant.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.376
He got down on one knee

00:28.419 --> 00:31.074
and asked me
if I would marry him.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.684
He told me
that his marriage is ending.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.295
He said he just needs
six months.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.774
Six months.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.428
MAUREEN:
Do you know your husband's
a homosexual?

00:37.472 --> 00:38.647
He has
that new disease

00:38.690 --> 00:39.952
that all the gay men
are spreading.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.302
That's a lie.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.434
He's the third man my
husband's seen who's had it.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.740
The first two are dead.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.263
You need care.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.874
Karl, you think I'd leave you
at a time like this?

00:48.918 --> 00:50.311
TOMMY:
Cancel the trip?

00:50.354 --> 00:51.790
That's not fair.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.836
This was supposed to be
the best summer of my life.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.056
And this could be the last
summer of Karl's life,

00:56.099 --> 00:57.840
so please stop sulking.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.930
NAOMI:
What's happened to my boy?

01:00.973 --> 01:02.453
Tommy's been in a car accident.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.976
He needed some stitches.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.108
What in the world?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.588
NURSE:
Is that a tattoo?

01:06.631 --> 01:08.329
One of these days
he'll regret that.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.852
So will she.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.028
Oh. Wow.
Right?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.812
You bought me a car?
I said
I would take care of you.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.163
JADE:
You can't return the car.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.207
It's not yours.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.600
Yeah, but he's coked
out of his mind.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.210
To accept a gift from a man
in that condition

01:20.254 --> 01:21.255
is not a good look.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.995
Just give me the keys.Stop it.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.867
Go upstairs, get your stuff!

01:24.910 --> 01:28.349
I want you out of my house now!

01:28.392 --> 01:29.654
That's not gonna happen.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.178
How can I help?

01:31.221 --> 01:32.962
Tell me everything
you know about Jade.

01:33.005 --> 01:36.618
Well, for starters,
that's not her real name.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.157
♪ "L" is for the way you look

01:54.201 --> 01:57.029

01:57.073 --> 02:00.555

EMILY:
My name is Emily Stanton.

02:57.351 --> 03:00.310
I was killed
over two years ago,

03:00.354 --> 03:04.184
but my mama still thinks
about me every day.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.925
Even when she's
just putting on lipstick,

03:06.969 --> 03:11.669
she'll suddenly remember
how much she loved me.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.803
I look down on Mama
from heaven.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.545
I watch her because
I'm worried about her.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.461
She's not happy,

03:20.504 --> 03:23.420
but Daddy doesn't know

03:23.464 --> 03:25.988
because she keeps smiling.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.817
Mama is very angry with him,

03:28.860 --> 03:32.864
and I have a feeling that she's gonna do something awful.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.650
So, what have you got planned
for the day?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.173
Oh, nothing much.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.349
I'll be spending time
with a new friend.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.699
Oh? What's her name?

03:41.743 --> 03:43.527
June.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.835
I have a feeling
you'd really like her.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.706
And what are you two doing?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.361
I offered to drive her
to a doctor's appointment,

03:51.405 --> 03:53.015
but that's really just an excuse

03:53.058 --> 03:55.278
for me to talk to her
about the man she's seeing.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.237
Why?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.282
I don't approve
of the relationship,

03:59.326 --> 04:01.676
so I've decided
to break them up.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.244
Beth Ann, that's not nice.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.507
Maybe not,

04:06.550 --> 04:08.857
but it's necessary.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.556
ED:
My name is Edmund Harte.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.212
I was 57 when I died.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.389
That's how my bitch wife
became my widow.

04:21.783 --> 04:25.177
I check in from time to time
to see how my kid is doing

04:25.221 --> 04:27.441
'cause I'm worried about him.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.923
His mother is desperate
to control him,

04:31.967 --> 04:34.448
but Tommy's a man now,

04:34.491 --> 04:37.015
able to make his own choices.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.888
And I know Naomi
is going to fight him

04:39.931 --> 04:42.717
every step of the way.

04:43.761 --> 04:46.198
Good luck, kid.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.636
My poor baby.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.639
Simone?

04:53.336 --> 04:54.729
No, it's me.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.561
Mom. Oh, God.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.693
It's okay, I know everything.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.087
You don't have
to protect her anymore.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.264
And I am not angry,

05:08.308 --> 05:11.180
not at you anyway.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.356
NURSE:
Mrs. Harte?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.402
The hospital administrator
has arrived.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.404
Ah, thank you.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.453
Mr. Kern, thank you so much
for agreeing to see me.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.933
How can I help you,
Ms. Harte?

05:24.976 --> 05:27.675
Do you happen to know
Simone Grove?

05:27.718 --> 05:30.330
I do. She's one of our
hospital's biggest fundraisers.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.898
Yes. Well, in between
benefit galas,

05:33.942 --> 05:36.553
it seems that Simone
has been molesting my son,

05:36.597 --> 05:40.078
possibly for years.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.864
If you allow her to visit
or even phone him,

05:42.907 --> 05:46.215
I will sue this hospital
and I will win.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.738
Do you understand?

05:47.782 --> 05:52.439
Yes. Um, I'm-I'm so sorry.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.615
Rest assured,
this matter will be handled

05:54.658 --> 05:56.094
with the utmost discretion.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.314
No need to be discreet
on my account.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.185
I intend on telling everyone
in this town

06:00.229 --> 06:04.712
what that woman has done
to my family.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.191
Nice tie.

06:13.024 --> 06:15.853
VERNA:
My name is Verna Roy.

06:15.897 --> 06:19.422
I was 32 when I died in a fire.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.815
At the time,

06:20.858 --> 06:25.123
I was a foster mother
to this one right here.

06:25.167 --> 06:28.344
I don't like to talk bad
about the living,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.347
but this gal's pure poison.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.697
I can see she's now living

06:33.741 --> 06:36.961
in a fancy house
with pretty things.

06:37.005 --> 06:40.182
That means some man
has fallen for her act.

06:40.225 --> 06:43.141
Eli, you're gonna be late!

06:43.185 --> 06:45.883
VERNA:
Stupid son of a bitch.

06:45.927 --> 06:49.234
He don't know
what she's capable of,

06:49.278 --> 06:51.759
but I got a feeling
he's about to find out.

06:51.802 --> 06:52.977
Wow.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.849
Moving kind of slow today.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.155
What did you give me last
night, a horse tranquilizer?

06:57.199 --> 06:58.809
Well, I wouldn't have
to give you anything

06:58.853 --> 07:00.550
if you'd stop doing coke
after 10:00.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.204
You talk like I have
self-control.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.510
I'm almost embarrassed
for you.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.816
Well, whatever.
Here, look.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.209
I've got a surprise.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.428
ELI:
Whoa. What's the occasion?

07:08.471 --> 07:11.126
It's Scorsese day.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.823
Oh, look,
it's just a meeting.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.869
I mean, the odds of him
directing my movie

07:14.912 --> 07:16.174
are, like,
a million to one.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.699
He loved your script.
I think that's a big deal.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.223
God, I just-- I hope I can
burn this off by 10:00.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.485
I feel so out of it.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.574
Well, luckily for you,

07:24.618 --> 07:27.751
I know how to prepare
a well-balanced meal.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.319
Mmm. You take such
good care of me.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.195
Scorsese's gonna direct
your movie, I know it,

07:37.239 --> 07:40.285
and it's gonna be a big hit
and we are going to be so rich.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.852
From your lips...

07:41.896 --> 07:46.204
I always knew something exciting
would happen to me one day.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.510
I think this is it.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.426
Again, all right,
it's just a meeting.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.341
I'm not worried.

07:52.384 --> 07:56.432
This is the year where
all my dreams come true.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.526
Hello, Jenny.

08:03.570 --> 08:07.356
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Grove.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.184
Please tell me you have
the veal piccata tonight.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.403
Just the thought of it
has kept me going all day.

08:11.447 --> 08:15.320
I'm sorry, but I can't seat you.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.540
Oh... oh,
you're not overbooked again?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.064
Well, I see our
usual table is empty.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.718
I don't know who
you promised it to,

08:21.762 --> 08:24.373
but they should have
gotten here sooner.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.118
KARL:
Here we are, my darling.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.554
Thank you.

08:31.598 --> 08:34.035
There we go.Anyway, I've been trying
to talk to Tommy

08:34.078 --> 08:36.559
in the hospital, but I can't
seem to get through to him.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.908
It's bizarre.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.910
Sorry, darling,
is it my imagination,

08:39.954 --> 08:41.346
or are people staring at us?

08:41.390 --> 08:42.739
I'm wearing Givenchy.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.002
They always stare
when I wear Givenchy.

08:45.046 --> 08:49.485
No, no, I think, actually,
they're just staring at me.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.010
You're right.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.883
It must be your jacket.
I told you plaid is over.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.234
Mr. and Mrs. Grove.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.757
Oh, Henry,
how lovely to see you.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.932
I'm terribly sorry,
but I'm afraid

09:01.976 --> 09:03.325
I have to ask you to leave.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.067
Oh, for God's sake,
he can take the jacket off.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.243
What's wrong?

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
Someone should have
notified you.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.855
Your membership to the club
has been revoked.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.249
You can't be serious.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.424
The committee met
this afternoon.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.468
The vote was unanimous.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.734
W... We've belonged to this club
for 15 years.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.779
Why on earth would you
want to kick us out?

09:22.823 --> 09:25.477
It's because I'm
ill, isn't it?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.175
We have to protect our members.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.872
It's a sexually
transmitted disease.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.353
You don't get it by sharing
a fucking tennis court.

09:31.396 --> 09:34.574
All the same, your membership
contract has a morals clause.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.447
Of all the people here,

09:38.490 --> 09:40.231
you think we're the ones
who lack morals?

09:40.275 --> 09:43.670
Mason Reed over there
is addicted to heroin,

09:43.713 --> 09:46.498
and Susan Paul is sleeping
with her brother-in-law.

09:46.542 --> 09:50.328
And you don't want to know
what happens in the club sauna.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.765
That's not helpful.

09:51.808 --> 09:55.420
For the last time,
Mr. and Mrs. Grove, please go.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.814
Shall we?

09:59.903 --> 10:02.340
Would you mind terribly...

10:02.384 --> 10:04.386
Oh, thank you.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.649
Goodbye, Henry.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.566
Good for you, dear.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.744
Oh, don't worry, Henry,
I'm gonna drink mine.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.497
Thank you again for recommending
this obstetrician.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.718
I talked to him on the phone,
he sounds wonderful.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.241
Sheila?

10:33.284 --> 10:35.547
Hmm?

10:35.591 --> 10:37.071
What are you
thinking about?

10:37.114 --> 10:39.987
Uh, your
upcoming wedding.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.293
Aw.
You excited for me?

10:42.337 --> 10:44.295
I am.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.514
Oh...

10:45.557 --> 10:47.908
I'm curious,

10:47.951 --> 10:51.041
have you had a chance
to discuss Rob's expectations?

10:51.085 --> 10:54.654
Expectations?Well, you want a career.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.787
Some men don't allow
their wives to work.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.571
Oh, well, Rob knows
I want to be a singer.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.834
We've talked about it a lot.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.880
Since you've become pregnant?

11:03.924 --> 11:07.405
Well...

11:07.449 --> 11:08.798
no.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.235
Might be time for a chat.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.629
Rob strikes me
as the kind of man who'd prefer

11:13.673 --> 11:15.109
his wife to stay home.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.937
You talk like you know him.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.591
Oh, I know his type.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
Rich, successful.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.901
That kind of man wants
his wife in the kitchen,

11:24.945 --> 11:27.643
feeding the kids and
pouring his martini.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.080
Rob's not like that.

11:30.124 --> 11:33.562
You absolutely sure?

11:35.912 --> 11:40.264
Well, he better be okay with it,
or we're gonna have a problem.

11:40.308 --> 11:44.225
That's what I was thinking.

11:54.235 --> 11:57.847
Okay, according to this,
we're looking for Suite 203.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.872
APRIL:
Sheila.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.135
Coming!

12:31.185 --> 12:33.013
You okay?

12:33.056 --> 12:35.580
Yeah, man, I'm sorry,
I'm just, I'm really nervous.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.974
You know, I basically grew up
on Scorsese movies.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.282
Hey, buddy,
do me a favor.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.110
I want you to manage
your expectations

12:43.153 --> 12:44.328
before we
walk in here.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.331
Shit. Why?
Is he an asshole?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.638
Let's just say it isn't
gonna be the meeting

12:49.681 --> 12:50.900
you were hoping for.

12:54.730 --> 12:55.862
What the fuck?

12:55.905 --> 12:57.907
Hello, Eli.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.649
So I was never
meeting Scorsese?

13:00.692 --> 13:03.217
Sorry. You really need
to hear her out.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.219
Why?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.047
Is this some sort
of bullshit intervention?

13:07.090 --> 13:08.788
Something like that.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.486
I'm gonna go get
some coffee.

13:11.529 --> 13:12.574
You want a cup?

13:14.706 --> 13:18.145
No. Cool. Cool.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.324
Well, this is humiliating.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.848
Eli, that wasn't my intention.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.242
But we need to talk.
Privately.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.244
About?

13:30.287 --> 13:32.724
Irene Tabatchnick.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
Who the hell's
Irene Tabatchnick?

13:36.163 --> 13:39.427
The woman who's been
sleeping in our bed.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.868
You may want to sit down
for the rest of this.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.699
If Dr. Bennett's wife
told people,

13:50.742 --> 13:53.310
that is a violation of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.922
We should have
his license revoked.

13:55.965 --> 13:59.360
How much energy do we really
want to devote to all this?

13:59.403 --> 14:02.015
This is discrimination.
We have to fight back.

14:02.058 --> 14:06.106
And draw more attention to
my sex life and my disease?

14:06.149 --> 14:08.499
You don't think people
will be sympathetic?

14:08.543 --> 14:10.240
On the contrary.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.286
I think the situation's
going to get much worse

14:12.329 --> 14:14.462
before it gets better.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.680
Well, we won't dwell on it.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.073
Why don't you take a nice,
long, hot bath?

14:17.117 --> 14:18.335
You seem exhausted.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.076
Mm.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.252
Turns out being shunned
by Republicans

14:22.296 --> 14:24.994
takes rather a lot
out of a person.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.699
Naomi, I've been trying
to reach you.

14:34.743 --> 14:35.918
How's Tommy?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.529
He's fine.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.922
Well, I keep calling
the hospital,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.403
but I can never seem
to get through.

14:42.446 --> 14:43.883
What are in the bags?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.145
Ah, presents.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.668
For me?

14:46.711 --> 14:48.061
No, fromyou.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.715
Every gift you ever gave me,
I'm returning them.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.587
I don't understand.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.937
This lovely figurine you got me

14:54.981 --> 14:56.286
while you were in Bavaria.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.114
I don't want it anymore.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.249
What the hell?!

15:02.292 --> 15:05.556
Or this sweet silver music box.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.862
I don't need that either.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.300
Have you lost your mind?

15:10.344 --> 15:15.001
I have, because I know
what you did to my son.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.264
Oh.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.743
That's all you have to say?

15:18.787 --> 15:20.397
I-I understand your anger,

15:20.441 --> 15:21.964
but if you'll just give me
a chance to explain...

15:22.008 --> 15:23.618
I will, just as soon as I return

15:23.661 --> 15:25.925
this darling crystal
paperweight.

15:27.491 --> 15:28.710
Stop it!

15:28.753 --> 15:30.625
You can't come in here
and destroy my home.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.627
Why not?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.716
You destroyed my life.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.283
If we can't talk
about this rationally,

15:36.326 --> 15:37.588
I will call the police.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.373
Go ahead, I'm leaving.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.853
You know, I would say that I'll
see you at the country club,

15:41.897 --> 15:43.246
but, you know...

15:43.290 --> 15:45.901
It was you.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.033
Who got you voted out?

15:47.076 --> 15:48.904
Yes.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.949
The board didn't need
much persuading

15:49.992 --> 15:51.820
once they knew that Karl

15:51.863 --> 15:53.865
was spreading a deadly disease.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.129
We were unceremoniously ejected

15:56.172 --> 15:57.869
in front of all
of our friends.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.610
I hope you're satisfied.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.743
Satisfied?

16:03.832 --> 16:07.270
You seduced my child.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.577
Do you honestly think
that I would be satisfied

16:09.620 --> 16:11.883
just getting you kicked out
of a country club?

16:11.927 --> 16:15.496
I am just getting started,
bitch.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.064
And before I am done,
I will burn you,

16:18.107 --> 16:22.546
your business, and this
poorly decorated shithole

16:22.590 --> 16:24.026
to the ground!

16:25.810 --> 16:28.161
Satisfied?

16:40.303 --> 16:41.826
What the hell happened here?

16:41.870 --> 16:44.829
Things just got worse.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.674
Sorry to intrude.

17:03.718 --> 17:06.416
I was wondering if I could
borrow a cup of sugar.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.071
I'm baking a cake, and I
forgot to check my pantry.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.814
You don't really need
a cup of sugar, do you?

17:14.903 --> 17:15.860
No.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.427
Come on in.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.613
Can I ask what happened?

17:29.657 --> 17:33.313
We were at a department store,

17:33.356 --> 17:36.533
and the sales clerk
recognized me.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.405
It turns out that he'd
gone to my high school

17:38.448 --> 17:39.710
two years after I did,

17:39.754 --> 17:42.409
so he knew a lot
of my old friends.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.760
We only spoke for five minutes.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.850
After we got back,
Ralph accused me

17:48.893 --> 17:51.026
of trying to seduce the man.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
That's why?

17:55.857 --> 17:57.424
He thought you were flirting?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.730
He gets jealous.
He can't help it.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.123
I don't understand

18:01.167 --> 18:03.517
how you can live like this.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.606
You can't possibly be happy.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.042
I'm not.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.044
So why don't you leave?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
I could ask you
the same question.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.136
What?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.399
Isn't your husband
cheating on you?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.186
He is.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.537
I had a feeling you knew.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.842
So why don't you leave him?

18:24.886 --> 18:27.541
It's an entirely
different situation.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.238
He's humiliating you.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.457
That's got to hurt.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.459
It does.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.026
Will you ever
trust him again?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.335
No.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.468
And if you did leave Rob,

18:41.511 --> 18:42.904
would he try and kill you?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.993
Of course not.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.690
Well, my husband would.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.605
He likes to threaten me

18:48.649 --> 18:52.043
with a loaded gun he keeps
in his bedside drawer.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.045
So I stay.

18:54.089 --> 18:58.311
What in God's name
is your excuse?

18:58.354 --> 19:02.053
I keep hoping for a miracle.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.711
That one day everything
will change.

19:07.755 --> 19:11.324
You and I should be friends.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
We have a lot in common.

19:16.633 --> 19:20.246
Irene Tabatchnick
is from Ohio.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.378
By the time she was 16,
she was thrown out

19:22.422 --> 19:24.075
of three foster homes.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.426
The first two times, Irene
had been caught stealing cash.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.558
So what? She was young.
She was a kid.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.994
She was kicked out
of her third home

19:30.038 --> 19:31.605
because her foster mother
accused her

19:31.648 --> 19:33.346
of trying to seduce her husband.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.043
Maybe the woman
was in denial

19:35.086 --> 19:36.218
about what her husband
was up to.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.915
Oh, we'll never know.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.743
A week later,
that house burned down.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.354
Burned down?

19:43.747 --> 19:45.401
Those foster parents died, Eli.

19:45.445 --> 19:49.057
And Irene Tabatchnick
just disappeared.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.059
So, what, you think she...?

19:51.102 --> 19:53.975
I mean, we can't prove anything,
but the cops in Ohio

19:54.018 --> 19:55.281
are dying to talk to her.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.502
Th-This is just so stupid.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.548
This is--
There's no way that Jade...

20:01.591 --> 20:03.071
Her name is Irene.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.160
Whatever.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.683
She loves us.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.643
If she loved you, would she
keep giving you cocaine?

20:09.686 --> 20:10.905
You look terrible,
by the way.

20:10.948 --> 20:14.387
Thank you.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.302
Come on, Eli.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.261
She keeps you high so she can
take advantage of you.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.394
So that you let her live
in our house,

20:21.437 --> 20:23.787
so that you buy
her a new car.You know, you didn't need

20:23.831 --> 20:26.312
to trick me to have this
conversation, Taylor.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.748
You could've just called.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.141
I did call.
Every hour.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.752
What are you talking about?
You never called me.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.797
I most certainly did.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.278
Look. Look.

20:36.322 --> 20:40.891
No missed calls.
No voice mails.

20:40.935 --> 20:44.417
That sneaky bitch
blocked my number.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.289
On my phone?

20:47.333 --> 20:49.683
She couldn't do that
without my pass code.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.730
Well, she has
your pass code.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.776
How does she have that?

20:55.819 --> 20:57.821
I gave it to her.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.694
So you could take
away my money.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.739
To keep you
from buying drugs.
Jesus.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.480
You know what, maybe she does
take advantage of me,

21:04.524 --> 21:06.090
but at least she
builds me up.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.875
She doesn't make me feel
like a fuck-up who's just

21:07.918 --> 21:09.398
destined to crash and burn.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.574
The only reason why I think
you're gonna crash and burn,

21:11.618 --> 21:14.142
Eli, is because
you've done it before.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.144
You have no idea
what it feels like

21:16.187 --> 21:17.928
to come home from work

21:17.972 --> 21:21.758
and then find you convulsing
on the kitchen floor.

21:21.802 --> 21:24.979
And then to call the ambulance,
which took forever.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.158
I'm not gonna
do that again, Eli.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.594
I'm...

21:31.638 --> 21:33.248
No one is asking you to.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.556
I don't need your help.

21:36.599 --> 21:40.037
I've got my career back.
I'm fine.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.953
The only one here
with a problem is you.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.352
You're an addict, Eli.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.919
You need to go to rehab,
and you know it.

21:51.962 --> 21:52.963
The only thing I know,
Taylor, is that

21:53.007 --> 21:54.530
this conversation is over.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.749
Eli, please stop...Stop!

21:55.792 --> 21:58.447
Enough!
Let me go.

22:56.723 --> 22:59.073
You like your new ball,
don't you?Yes.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.205
After dinner, we're going
to write a thank you note

23:01.249 --> 23:02.381
to Aunt Lydia.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.252
I don't know how to write.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.819
I'll do the writing.
You can draw a big heart

23:05.862 --> 23:07.386
right next to our names.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.258
Look, dear, your father forgot
to bring in the trash can.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.825
Play here for a second.
I'll be right back.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.449
Come along, Emily.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.277
Don't you want to show
your daddy your new ball?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.453
Yes.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.718
Hey there.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.155
What are you two
doing home?

23:38.199 --> 23:39.592
I didn't expect you back
for another hour.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.594
Aunt Lydia wasn't feeling well.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.986
We had to cut our visit short.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.380
Hey, princess, what
do you got there?A ball.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.470
Aunt Lydia gave it to me
for my birthday.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.168
Well...

23:51.212 --> 23:52.474
Her birthday was
two months ago.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.084
Be nice.
It's the thought that counts.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.956
Can I go play?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.914
Of course you can.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.006
Rob, did you lose a button?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.486
I just found one
on the floor.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.662
Ah. Oh, I guess I did.
Thanks.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.752
Mama.I'm sorry, honey.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.537
Here you go.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.712
I'm making mac
and cheese for dinner,

24:12.755 --> 24:14.801
so don't be too long, okay?

24:57.191 --> 24:58.540
Honey?

24:58.584 --> 25:01.543
Someone call a doctor.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.158
Emily? Emily, honey, wake up.
Open your eyes.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.073
Open your eyes, honey.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.119
Open your eyes.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.381
Please wake up.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.949
Please...
Please...

25:15.992 --> 25:17.994
What the hell?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.444
Who was driving this car?!

25:33.488 --> 25:35.795
Sh-She, uh,
she-she came out

25:35.838 --> 25:37.710
of nowhere, mister, I swear.
I tried to stop...

25:56.685 --> 26:00.471
You left
the gate open?

26:00.515 --> 26:03.562
No. I'm sure I locked it.You're sure?

26:03.605 --> 26:06.173
Then how did Emily
get out of the backyard?

26:06.216 --> 26:08.479
The latch is six feet
off the ground!

26:08.523 --> 26:12.222
I don't know. Maybe I forgot.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.398
You didn't
lock the gate.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.749
You didn't
lock the gate,

26:16.792 --> 26:18.925
and you let her
out to play.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.624
I had to make dinner.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.844
That's no excuse.

26:24.887 --> 26:28.587
Our baby is dead.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.982
I'm sorry.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.906
I thought it was locked.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.661
Amy.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.578
I just got a call from Naomi.
Does Karl have AIDS?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.539
How could you not tell me?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.019
Well, we thought we had time.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.543
I mean, as you can see,
I'm not exactly at death's door.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.676
He has all the best doctors,
so don't worry.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.418
Karl will absolutely be able
to walk you down the aisle.

27:17.461 --> 27:20.421
At this point, I'm not even sure
there will be a wedding.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.075
What?

27:22.118 --> 27:23.729
Naomi's called
all of our friends

27:23.772 --> 27:25.165
and told them Karl is sick.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.036
People have been canceling
right and left.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.690
Oh, Lord.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.561
And if nobody's coming,
why bother?

27:30.605 --> 27:33.695
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling.
Is there anything we can do?

27:33.739 --> 27:36.611
Well...

27:36.655 --> 27:41.572
we might be able to salvage
this thing if you didn't come.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.618
To the wedding?

27:44.750 --> 27:46.708
I understand.

27:46.752 --> 27:50.190
Uh, of course, I will stay home.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.626
Thank you.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.194
No. Karl has to be
at the wedding.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.674
Who's gonna walk you
down the aisle?

27:55.717 --> 27:56.892
You can do it.

27:56.936 --> 28:00.200
I did not spend $6,000
on an Armani dress

28:00.243 --> 28:01.854
just to give it
a shared entrance.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.030
Okay, let's not argue.
Thank you.

28:04.073 --> 28:07.250
I... I don't mind.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.774
No!

28:08.817 --> 28:10.863
We are a family.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.430
When bad things happen, we're
supposed to support each other.

28:13.474 --> 28:14.649
The way I see it,

28:14.693 --> 28:17.608
he is supporting me
by staying away.

28:17.652 --> 28:20.307
I have to call my guests
and tell them it's safe to come.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.661
Amy, think of what
you're doing.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.707
You're choosing
a few cowardly bigots

28:28.750 --> 28:29.969
over the man
who raised you.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.405
I'm the bride.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.624
It's my day, and
I want it to be perfect.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.192
I am sorry if Karl's
deadly illness

28:36.236 --> 28:38.717
is scraping some of the glitter
off of your event,

28:38.760 --> 28:41.154
but let's face it,
this won't be your last wedding.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.417
Nice.
More importantly,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.462
if Karl can't attend,
I won't either.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.900
Oh, Simone.Fine.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.816
Stay home. You'll save me
some embarrassment.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.862
Karl's not the only one
everybody's talking about.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.087
My daughter is a monster.

29:01.130 --> 29:04.307
Well, she's a bride.
It's basically the same thing.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.322
Hey!

29:23.022 --> 29:25.633
So... how'd
the meeting go?

29:25.676 --> 29:30.159
I want to hear
everything.

29:30.203 --> 29:31.595
Well, let's just say

29:31.639 --> 29:33.815
that Scorsese's not gonna be
directing my movie.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.817
Oh, no.

29:35.861 --> 29:39.255
I'm so sorry.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.649
But at least he loved
the script, right?

29:43.303 --> 29:45.348
He did. Yeah.
Good.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.221
Yeah. Yeah, he especially
liked the part

29:48.264 --> 29:50.658
where Eva burns
the drug dealer's house down.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.834
He liked that?

29:52.878 --> 29:55.228
Yeah.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.839
Yeah, he liked it so much, he
asked me how I came up with it,

29:57.883 --> 30:00.842
and, you know, of course I had
to tell him it was your idea.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.194
You didn't have
to give me credit.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.370
Yeah, well...

30:07.414 --> 30:10.025
How did you come up with that,
by the way?

30:10.069 --> 30:12.680
Uh, it just came to me.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.203
Just out of the blue?

30:14.247 --> 30:16.597
Yeah.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.908
'Cause it-it's such
an unusual concept, you know,

30:22.951 --> 30:26.520
arson as a form
of revenge.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.218
You have no idea
how that came to you?

30:29.262 --> 30:31.525
Why does it matter?

30:31.568 --> 30:34.006
I-I'm-I'm just curious.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.443
I don't know--
it just popped into my head.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.793
Just, boop?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.318
Boop. Yeah.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.975
Sometimes that happens.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.457
Is that how you came up
with the name Jade?

30:50.500 --> 30:52.807
It just popped
into your head?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.156
What?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.158
It suits you better than
Irene, I'll give you that.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.293
Who have you been talking to?

31:00.336 --> 31:02.904
Hey, watch the road.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.645
Eli, do not fuck with me.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.212
Or else what,
you're gonna burn down my house?

31:06.255 --> 31:08.779
You talked to Duke?

31:08.823 --> 31:12.783
Oh, my God.
You did those things.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.960
Did what?
What did he say about me?

31:15.003 --> 31:17.310
Oh, my God, you killed
those people. Oh, my God.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.834
Eli, Eli,
the man is a liar!
Hey, hey.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.097
All right,
slow down, slow down.Eli, you can't believe

31:22.141 --> 31:23.925
a fucking word he says!Jesus, watch out!

31:31.106 --> 31:33.500
Karl, it's after 11:00.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.371
When are you going
to the gallery?

31:35.415 --> 31:37.025
When people
stop assuming

31:37.069 --> 31:40.463
you can catch AIDS
from a lithograph.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.204
Oh, screw them all.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.337
Shall we have lunch
at the Huntington?

31:44.380 --> 31:46.643
Well, if you're paying.Good.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.690
I can't spend another afternoon
staring at these walls.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.344
Oh, I can't either.

31:51.387 --> 31:54.086
What were we thinking
with all the damn purple?

31:59.613 --> 32:02.007
Is it just my imagination or...?No.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.139
No. They're
staring at us.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.315
What have we done now?

32:12.147 --> 32:14.062
Oh, my God.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.672
Wha...

32:15.716 --> 32:17.805
Did anyone see who did this?

32:17.848 --> 32:21.548
Someone had to have
seen something.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.506
Don't just gawk. Answer me!

32:23.550 --> 32:26.161
Simone. Karl!

32:29.077 --> 32:31.471
I'm-I'm a little dizzy. I just
need to go inside and lie down.

32:31.514 --> 32:34.126
You need to see a doctor.
Can you make it to the car?

32:34.169 --> 32:36.128
Can someone
please help us?

32:37.912 --> 32:39.740
Please help us
to the car!

32:39.783 --> 32:41.872
Is he the one
with AIDS?

32:41.916 --> 32:44.484
Who cares?
He's a human being!

32:46.312 --> 32:48.227
Oh, thank you.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.272
Thank you so much.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.624
You know, I'm so grateful.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.670
I want to hire you
to work on our property.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.889
Darling, he's worked for us
for six years.

32:58.933 --> 33:02.023
Oh, of course. Um,
thank you very much, uh...

33:02.067 --> 33:04.547
Julio.
Right.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.419
Julio. Here you go.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.037
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.149
I have to go.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.716
What?

33:52.073 --> 33:54.554
Mmm. God, I missed you.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.643
I missed this.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.559
Mmm, me, too.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.957
So, I had an
interesting day.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.568
Yeah?

34:08.611 --> 34:11.049
I talked to Mr. Porter, that
fella who runs the nightclub,

34:11.092 --> 34:12.789
I told him about the baby.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.009
Ah.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.924
What did he have to say?

34:16.967 --> 34:19.231
Well, he said
congratulations.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.799
He also said,
once I have the baby,

34:22.843 --> 34:25.019
he wants me right back
up on that stage.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.240
Isn't that terrific?

34:28.283 --> 34:30.155
Yeah.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.939
Wow.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.688
I knew you would think so.

34:45.039 --> 34:48.912
But isn't it a little early
to talk about this?

34:48.956 --> 34:51.437
Why don't we see how you feel
after the baby arrives?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.352
I won't feel
any different.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.963
Well, taking care of a baby
is hard work.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.487
You might be too tired
to keep singing.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.881
I'll never be
too tired to sing.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.405
We'll see.

35:06.191 --> 35:09.019
Rob...
Hmm?

35:09.063 --> 35:10.586
Hey.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.719
It's my dream.

35:13.763 --> 35:16.766
And dreams are great,

35:16.810 --> 35:19.726
but you have
to be realistic.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.641
It's a tough business
to break into.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.164
I know.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.472
My Beth Ann wanted
to be in show business,

35:26.515 --> 35:30.998
and she finally came
to her senses and gave it up.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.173
Thank God.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.001
Well, maybe I'm more
talented than she is.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.700
She wasn't half-bad.
She wanted to play piano.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.919
Piano?

35:38.962 --> 35:41.704
Yeah, she wanted
to be a concert pianist,

35:41.748 --> 35:44.142
which is ridiculous.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.449
But you do
what you want.

35:47.493 --> 35:51.323
As long as dinner's on the table
when I get home,

35:51.366 --> 35:53.151
what do I care?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.025
You know, it's kind of funny.

35:58.068 --> 36:02.116
Uh, my friend Sheila also wanted
to be a concert pianist.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.206
Yeah? Small world.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.381
Well, I got to go.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.776
I'll call you tonight.Mmm.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.007
DR. CHARLES:
Mrs. Grove?

36:24.051 --> 36:25.618
Yes?

36:25.661 --> 36:27.272
Based on the
initial exam,

36:27.315 --> 36:30.231
we think your husband probably
has Pneumocystis pneumonia,

36:30.275 --> 36:34.148
an infection common in men
with suppressed immune systems.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.932
How serious is it?

36:35.976 --> 36:38.152
Most patients recover
with treatment.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.372
"Most"? Do you mean some don't?

36:40.415 --> 36:43.853
We're gonna run some tests,
then we'll know more.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.899
Thank you.

36:57.127 --> 37:00.130
Naomi.
Nurse, put that down

37:00.174 --> 37:01.958
and call security.SIMONE: Don't bother.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.352
I just have one thing to say
and then I'll go.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.094
If you think I'm gonna let you
go anywhere near my child...

37:07.137 --> 37:09.314
I'm not here for Tommy.
I'm here to apologize.

37:09.357 --> 37:12.142
An apology? Now?

37:12.186 --> 37:14.754
Color me disinterested.Then just tell me

37:14.797 --> 37:18.018
what I have to do to get you
to leave Karl alone.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.889
I haven't done anything to him.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.805
You have spread your poison
and made him a pariah.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.067
He has lost friends,

37:24.111 --> 37:25.721
been banned from
his daughter's wedding,

37:25.765 --> 37:27.767
had his home vandalized.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.552
God, he's sick.
He does not deserve

37:30.596 --> 37:34.600
to spend his last days
hounded by scandal and shame.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.646
Maybe he doesn't, but if
Karl's caught in the crossfire,

37:37.690 --> 37:40.823
it's only because he's been
standing too close to you.

37:40.867 --> 37:44.131
Naomi, I am begging.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.960
Blame me, destroy me.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.484
I promise I won't fight back.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.617
But please leave Karl out of it.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.452
Mom.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.369
What have you done?

38:14.379 --> 38:16.555
Eli.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.426
Are you his wife?

38:18.470 --> 38:20.776
Yeah.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.388
Is he okay?
Why-- why is he unconscious?

38:23.431 --> 38:25.085
He needed to be sedated.

38:25.128 --> 38:27.566
His ribs are fractured,
but he'll recover.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.524
Oh, thank God.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.961
Before we put him out,
he was asking for you.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.007
We told him you
were on your way.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.226
I came as fast as I could.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.880
He wrote you this note.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.013
Said it was important.

38:46.411 --> 38:50.719
Everything okay?

38:50.763 --> 38:54.375
Yeah.
I think it will be.

38:54.419 --> 38:58.248
It's gonna be a while
before he wakes up.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.338
Well, I'm gonna be here
when he does.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.401
Mrs. Stanton.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.272
Hello, Claire.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.448
I need to speak to Rob.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.797
He's not here.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.756
How long until he returns?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.671
I'm not sure.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.977
Are you going on a trip?

39:31.020 --> 39:34.241
I'm going back
home to Kansas.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.765
For a visit?
No.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.419
I'm leaving Rob.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.421
He's been having an affair.

39:40.465 --> 39:41.683
He doesn't know I know,

39:41.727 --> 39:43.293
and I thought I should
tell him in person.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.427
Oh, Mrs. Stanton,
I'm so sorry.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.474
Thank you.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.389
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

39:53.826 --> 39:54.914
He's at her apartment.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.358
So you've known
about this.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.883
I wish you had told me.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.146
I thought we were friends.

40:10.190 --> 40:13.672
I haven't been your friend,

40:13.715 --> 40:15.978
not for one second.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.893
And you should hate me

40:17.937 --> 40:19.591
for everything I've done to you.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.244
What are you talking about?

40:23.072 --> 40:26.424
Rob's been cheating
on you for years...

40:26.467 --> 40:28.687
with all sorts of women.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.867
And I was one of them.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.568
I was protecting you.

40:40.612 --> 40:41.787
By destroying their lives?

40:41.830 --> 40:43.092
She took advantage of you.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.790
No. I pursued her.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.226
And what we had, it was real.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.794
You only think that because
she twisted your mind.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.796
Trust me, you are
better off without her.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.493
No, maybe I'd be
better off without you.

40:52.537 --> 40:53.625
Tommy...

40:53.668 --> 40:55.496
Dad always said that
you were vindictive,

40:55.540 --> 40:57.933
and I should get away from you
as soon as I got the chance.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.761
Your dad was a pathetic drunk.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.154
But he had your number.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.634
I'm leaving tonight.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.462
And I'll be on the first plane
to Europe in the morning.

41:04.505 --> 41:05.941
Well, you think I'm just
gonna pay for you to go

41:05.985 --> 41:07.073
traipsing around Europe?

41:07.116 --> 41:09.205
I'm 18.
I have access to my trust fund.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.338
I don't need anything from you.

41:11.381 --> 41:14.515
I am still your mother.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.953
No, from now on, you're just
some lady that I used to know.

41:59.821 --> 42:00.779
You pulling out?

42:00.822 --> 42:02.781
Not yet.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.130
I'm waiting for someone.

42:10.353 --> 42:14.314
You have to understand,
I have wanted to tell you

42:14.357 --> 42:18.187
for years, but...

42:18.231 --> 42:21.582
Oh, God, I am so ashamed.

42:21.626 --> 42:24.803
I'm leaving him, Claire.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.805
It doesn't matter anymore.

42:26.848 --> 42:29.677
You won't feel that way
once I've told you the rest.

42:29.721 --> 42:31.592
There's something else?

42:38.425 --> 42:40.470
The last time I slept
with your husband...

42:44.300 --> 42:46.041
...was the day
your child died.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.659
CLAIRE:
We were in your bedroom
at your old house...

42:54.702 --> 42:57.575
...when Rob heard
a car door slam.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.794
He got up to see
you and your daughter

42:59.838 --> 43:01.056
had come home early.

43:03.755 --> 43:06.192
He yelled at me to get dressed.

43:13.068 --> 43:15.593
You began dragging a trash can

43:15.636 --> 43:16.724
to the backyard,

43:16.768 --> 43:19.509
so we had time
to run downstairs.

43:22.164 --> 43:24.427
I was going to hide
in a closet,

43:24.471 --> 43:26.429
but Rob said it was
too dangerous.

43:30.477 --> 43:32.871
So he told me to get out

43:32.914 --> 43:36.483
through the side of the house.

43:36.526 --> 43:39.965
So while you were coming in
the front door...

43:40.008 --> 43:42.794
Hey there.

43:42.837 --> 43:45.666
...I ran around
the side of the house...

43:48.713 --> 43:50.497
...and left through the gate.

43:50.540 --> 43:53.587
And I left it open.

43:57.025 --> 44:01.551
A few hours later,
someone from work called.

44:01.595 --> 44:05.033
They told me what had happened,

44:05.077 --> 44:07.514
and I instantly knew
it was my fault.

44:16.523 --> 44:18.743
Oh, Mrs. Stanton,

44:18.786 --> 44:23.748
I can't even begin
to tell you how sorry I am.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.059
I have one question.

44:32.408 --> 44:34.019
What's that?

44:37.022 --> 44:41.200
Did Rob know you had not
closed the gate?

44:44.856 --> 44:48.729
I called him that night
and I told him.

44:48.773 --> 44:52.211
And he said he could
forgive me...

44:52.254 --> 44:56.650
if I never told anyone else
what had happened.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.697
And I didn't.

44:59.740 --> 45:02.134
I was so ashamed.

45:06.312 --> 45:09.837
I know you can't forgive
me for what I've done,

45:09.881 --> 45:11.839
but I will spend
the rest of my life

45:11.883 --> 45:15.016
trying to atone for
what I did to you.

45:18.106 --> 45:20.326
Get up.

45:29.117 --> 45:33.643
You did... a horrible thing,
Claire.

45:38.126 --> 45:41.216
But I'll forgive you

45:41.260 --> 45:45.046
if you promise to do
one thing for me.

45:45.090 --> 45:47.396
Oh...

45:47.440 --> 45:49.703
anything.

45:55.883 --> 46:00.322
You will never tell
another living soul

46:00.366 --> 46:03.325
that we had this conversation.

46:03.369 --> 46:04.936
What?

46:04.979 --> 46:07.590
Rob can't know.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.422
I've decided not to leave him.

46:14.902 --> 46:16.121
I don't understand.

46:16.164 --> 46:18.776
You don't have to.

46:18.819 --> 46:23.432
All you need to do
is give me your solemn vow.

46:23.476 --> 46:28.350
Do that and you have
my forgiveness.

46:30.396 --> 46:33.007
Okay.

46:33.051 --> 46:34.530
I promise.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.406
Thank you, Claire.

47:09.957 --> 47:12.046
Hey, girl,

47:12.090 --> 47:13.482
what are you doing here?

47:13.526 --> 47:15.310
She missed you.

47:15.354 --> 47:17.617
Jade.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.575
I hope you don't mind.

47:19.619 --> 47:23.014
I let myself in.
Your lock's busted.

47:23.057 --> 47:25.799
Why do I get the feeling
that you busted it?

47:25.843 --> 47:27.975
Don't be mad.
I wanted to see you.

47:28.019 --> 47:29.672
Why, so you could
break my other leg?

47:29.716 --> 47:31.718
Oh, God,
I'm so sorry about that.

47:31.761 --> 47:33.546
Things got a little crazy
last time,

47:33.589 --> 47:35.678
but I'm trying to make it
up to you.

47:37.724 --> 47:39.726
See you cleaned
a little bit.

47:39.769 --> 47:42.250
It was kind of a pigsty.
Not that I'm being critical.

47:42.294 --> 47:44.426
I know you've
been busy with, um,

47:44.470 --> 47:46.341
jail and stuff.

47:46.385 --> 47:49.692
And you're cooking?Yeah, pot roast.

47:49.736 --> 47:51.520
The recipe you like.

47:51.564 --> 47:53.174
Why aren't you cooking
for your rich friends

47:53.218 --> 47:55.089
in their fancy mansion?

47:55.133 --> 47:56.482
Did they kick you out?

47:56.525 --> 47:58.658
Eli found out about my past,

47:58.701 --> 48:01.617
so I packed up my stuff
and I left.

48:01.661 --> 48:04.272
What a shame.

48:05.491 --> 48:07.275
Did you talk to him?

48:07.319 --> 48:09.234
Now, why would you think that?

48:09.277 --> 48:11.671
Because you're the only one
who knows my real name.

48:11.714 --> 48:15.631
Hand to God, I did not tell Eli.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.546
Did you tell someone else?

48:17.590 --> 48:20.549
Taylor came to see me in jail.

48:20.593 --> 48:23.291
Oh, shit!

48:23.335 --> 48:24.727
Yeah, she offered
to pay my bail

48:24.771 --> 48:26.816
if I ratted you out, so...

48:26.860 --> 48:29.036
Taylor is a lawyer!

48:29.080 --> 48:31.647
She knows people, and the cops
are still looking for me.

48:31.691 --> 48:33.171
I could end up in prison!

48:33.214 --> 48:35.303
Yeah, and I may be walking
with a cane for a year,

48:35.347 --> 48:36.652
so I guess we're even.

48:36.696 --> 48:40.656
I got to get out of town.
I need money.

48:40.700 --> 48:42.397
Don't look at me, I'm busted.Well, you must have something.

48:42.441 --> 48:44.443
Like, what about
your grandfather's watch?

48:44.486 --> 48:46.271
What about it?Give it to me! I'll pawn it.

48:46.314 --> 48:47.750
The hell you will!

48:47.794 --> 48:50.971
Goddamn it, Duke!
You owe it to me!

48:51.015 --> 48:53.060
You really fucked me this time!

48:53.104 --> 48:56.411
I don't owe you shit. Now get
the fuck out of my house!

48:56.455 --> 48:59.545
You stay away
from me.

48:59.588 --> 49:00.807
Again with the
crazy eyes, huh?

49:02.200 --> 49:05.507
Look, baby, just put
the knife down, okay?

49:05.551 --> 49:07.379
Just put the knife...

49:10.512 --> 49:11.992
You're gonna pay for that.
