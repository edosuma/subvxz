I'm trying to find my
way to the sunken ship.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.308
Which sunken ship?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.395
There is more than one
sunken ship?

01:45.397 --> 01:46.815
Oh yes sirree.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.359
Lots of sunken ships down here.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.280
Can't say how many, never
counted 'em.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.448
I am lost.

01:57.409 --> 02:01.410
I just moved to a sunken ship
a few days ago with my family

02:01.412 --> 02:03.914
and I can't find my way home.

02:05.332 --> 02:06.624
(COUGHS)

02:06.626 --> 02:07.582

seaweed, and sandy beach.

02:41.618 --> 02:43.453
Fifi, you okay?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.370
I was havin' a bad dream.

02:45.372 --> 02:48.041
I was lost and I couldn't find
my way back

02:48.043 --> 02:49.709
to Fishtail Reef.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.211
I was alone and it was so scary.

02:53.213 --> 02:55.840
Oh honey, it's okay, Fifi.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.382
You're not lost!

02:57.384 --> 03:00.470
It was just a bad dream.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.971
It felt so real, Mama.

03:02.973 --> 03:04.639
There were all these
mean sharks.

03:04.641 --> 03:06.934
They were going to eat me!

03:06.936 --> 03:10.395
Who was going to eat
my sweet little Fifi?

03:10.397 --> 03:11.856
Sharks!

03:11.858 --> 03:12.857
Sharks?

03:12.859 --> 03:13.983
In my dream.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.401
It was very scary.

03:16.403 --> 03:19.780
I'm sure it was, but
not all sharks are mean.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.324
Like, like Professor Shark?

03:22.326 --> 03:25.953
Well he's the best teacher
in the whole wide ocean.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.249
He is a big friendly shark.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.168
Papa, tell us again how
to scare away mean sharks.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.463
Okay, Finn, I'll tell you and
Fifi how

to scare away mean sharks.

(LAUGHS)

03:47.686 --> 03:48.851
Goonches?

Goonches?

03:50.270 --> 03:51.812
Goonches?

03:51.814 --> 03:55.774
Goonches are big sea monsters
that eat sharks, right Papa?

03:55.776 --> 03:56.942
That's right, Finn.

03:56.944 --> 04:00.905
Yell "goonches" and sharks swim
away fast.

Thanks, sis.

04:30.185 --> 04:32.937
We gotta look cool on
our first day of school.

You both look very nice.

04:35.899 --> 04:38.233
Did you finish your breakfish?

05:41.966 --> 05:42.798
(LAUGHS)

05:42.800 --> 05:44.384
What was it like?

05:44.386 --> 05:46.551
I did walk on land.

05:46.553 --> 05:52.474
It was a very sandy beach and
the sand tickled my flippers.

05:52.476 --> 05:53.642

06:16.250 --> 06:18.459
I hope it's Professor Shark.

I heard he takes his class
on a lot of field trips.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.134
I heard that too!

06:24.968 --> 06:28.010

Would everyone

For our first day of school

08:35.849 --> 08:38.472
I've never been on
a field trip before.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.934
What is a field trip,

What is your name?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.399
My name is Chopper.

08:45.357 --> 08:49.609
Well Chopper, a field
trip is when our whole class

08:49.611 --> 08:53.824
travels together to a new
place to explore and learn.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.492

I love exploring new places.

This is going to be so much fun.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.752
There are a few
important things we must do

09:06.754 --> 09:09.004
to prepare for our field trip.

09:09.006 --> 09:09.881
Like what?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.342
My name is Finn, I'm Fifi's
brother.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.800
Hi Finn!

09:13.802 --> 09:15.677
I will tell you what
we need to do.

09:15.679 --> 09:19.473
First, each of you needs
to be paired with a buddy.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.017
You will swim next to that buddy

09:21.019 --> 09:24.728
at all times during
our field trip.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.315
I hope I get to
be with you, Lily.

Who is next?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.746
How about me and Sammy?

09:41.748 --> 09:42.579
Sammy?

09:42.581 --> 09:43.998
I am Sammy Swordfish.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.376
Finn and me like to swim
through Fishtail Reef together.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.877
Perfect!

09:47.879 --> 09:49.378
I'm Trigger.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.214
I think going on a field trip
on our first day of school

09:52.216 --> 09:53.424
is fish sticks!

09:53.426 --> 09:54.300
Fish sticks?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.301
That means cool.

09:56.303 --> 09:59.597
Who would you like to
choose as your swim buddy?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.474
I would like Chopper
to be my swim buddy.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.643
I would like that too,
Trigger.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.895
Very good!

will be swim buddies.

Hi Professor Shark,
my name is Petal.

10:12.403 --> 10:16.321
I was really hoping you
would be my teacher.

10:16.323 --> 10:19.617
I'm glad you're my student,
Petal.

10:19.619 --> 10:24.204
I would like Kiki the
pufferfish to be my swim mate.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.748
I'm glad you chose me, Petal.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.251
That leaves me and Tang.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.084
My name's Diesel.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.795
And I'm Tang.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.424
Diesel and I like to
race through the reef.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.343
Excellent, you're already swim
buddies!

10:37.345 --> 10:39.970
What an interesting
group of sea animals.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.431
Is everyone ready to swim
two-by-two

10:42.433 --> 10:46.853
deep down to the bottom of the
sea to visit a sunken ship?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.772
ALL: A sunken ship?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.650
Maybe we'll find
some buried treasure.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.776
Oh yippee!

10:54.778 --> 10:56.320
That would be funtastic.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.449
Fishy swishy bubbleyishy cool!

This is going to be
our best adventure ever!

NARRATOR: The fish form
pairs to keep them safe

11:06.416 --> 11:10.417
while the deep dark sea
can be a dangerous place

11:10.419 --> 11:13.338
but our little fishes
need not fear

11:13.340 --> 11:15.422
for Professor Shark and soon,

11:15.424 --> 11:17.800
an assistant teacher
will be near.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.177
Before we leave for the
sunken ship adventure,

11:20.179 --> 11:24.266
I have one more surprise!

11:26.894 --> 11:27.728
Alba!

11:28.520 --> 11:29.645
Welcome.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.230
Class, I'd like you
to meet Alba.

11:32.232 --> 11:33.108
Hi class.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.319
Alba is a white seal.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.780
She is my teacher's assistant.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.406
What is that?

11:40.408 --> 11:43.033
A teacher assistant is
someone who helps

11:43.035 --> 11:45.869
a professor in the classroom.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.080
Alba is studying to be a
teacher.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.416
- Hooray!
- Yay!

11:52.671 --> 11:54.837
How do you learn
to be a teacher?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.089
It's not easy,
I had to work hard

11:57.091 --> 12:00.676
to get accepted into the
Aquatic Mammal University,

12:00.678 --> 12:02.262
better known as AMU.

12:03.181 --> 12:07.557
I am also going to learn a lot
by helping Professor Shark,

12:07.559 --> 12:10.268
the best professor in the sea.

12:10.270 --> 12:11.271
ALL: Yay!

12:12.315 --> 12:14.440
I'm very excited to
be joining you

12:14.442 --> 12:16.858
on this special
first day of school

12:16.860 --> 12:19.778
and on your very
first field trip.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.863
ALL: Yay!

12:21.865 --> 12:23.866
I see you are
already in pairs.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.828
Are we ready to go,
Professor Shark?

12:26.830 --> 12:30.373
One more important thing
before we go:

12:30.375 --> 12:33.459
there are dangerous
creatures out by the wreck

12:33.461 --> 12:37.673
including a sly shark named
Toothy Magrue, but don't worry,

12:38.549 --> 12:42.426
Alba and I won't let
anything happen to you.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.179
NARRATOR: The students
swim, they bob and dip,

12:45.181 --> 12:48.432
eager to start their
fun field trip.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.102
They're going to
see a sunken ship.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.978
As we swim to the sunken ship

12:52.980 --> 12:55.982
I would like each of you
to tell Alba your name

12:55.984 --> 12:58.066
and a little about yourself.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.651
I will go first.

12:59.653 --> 13:05.657
I'm Fifi, I'm a pink pastel
fish with big goldfish eyes.

13:05.659 --> 13:10.872
I love to play games and
swim through Fishtail Reef.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.541
Hello Fifi, it's nice
to meet you.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.960
My name is Lily,
I'm a blue whale.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.131
Whales are not fish,
we are mammals.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.882
I can breathe air!

13:21.884 --> 13:26.512
I love to each and I'm going
to be very big when I grow up.

13:26.514 --> 13:30.266
And Lily is my best friend.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.977
And Fifi is my best friend.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.896
Nice to meet you, Lily.

13:34.898 --> 13:39.066
Whales are very
special marine mammals.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.276
My name is Finn,
I'm Fifi's brother.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.695
I'm a blue pastel fish
and I want

13:43.697 --> 13:46.031
to be a scientist
when I grow up.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.325
I love learning about the sea!

13:48.327 --> 13:50.203
So do I, Finn!

13:50.205 --> 13:53.122
We are going to learn a lot
together.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.123
I'm Sammy Swordfish.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.958
Do you know a lot
about the sea, Alba?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.419
I do, and I can't
wait to teach

13:58.421 --> 14:00.213
you everything I know, Sammy.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.632
Tell me more about you.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.343
Chop chop, I have a
really cool sword as a nose,

14:05.345 --> 14:08.762
I can swim really fast,
and I like to tell jokes.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.141
Telling jokes is a very
special talent.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.310
Can I tell a joke now?

14:14.312 --> 14:16.938
Where does Alba like to eat?

14:16.940 --> 14:19.065
A joke about me?

14:19.067 --> 14:22.568
I don't know, where does
Alba like to eat, Sammy?

14:22.570 --> 14:27.281
At a dive-in (LAUGHS)
you get it, yeah?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.407
(LAUGHS)

14:28.409 --> 14:30.785
That was funny, Sammy.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.911
(LAUGHS)

14:31.913 --> 14:33.829
That's funny.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.123
And you are?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.373
I'm Trigger.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.002
I'm a seahorse,
a very special fish.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.213
I have a head shaped
like a horse

14:42.215 --> 14:47.175
and a really cool tail that
can wrap around seaweed.

14:47.177 --> 14:51.390
I see you have four flippers
(LAUGHS) that's fishadocious!

14:52.350 --> 14:53.724
(LAUGHS)

14:53.726 --> 14:54.850
That's right, Trigger.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.310
I do have four flippers!

14:57.312 --> 14:59.314
Semi what?

15:00.191 --> 15:03.316
Oh, my name is Kiki.

15:03.318 --> 15:06.863
Semiaquatic is a
very big word, Kiki.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.156
It means I live part
of the time in water

15:09.158 --> 15:11.868
and part of the time on land.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.579
I'm a pufferfish so
I can't go on land

15:14.581 --> 15:17.959
but I can blow my body
up into a big round ball.

15:18.999 --> 15:21.919
I have a lot of sharp
spikes on my body.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.171
I love to play ocean soccer.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.592
I like to play soccer too!

15:28.635 --> 15:29.471
Help!

15:30.221 --> 15:32.680
I am so sorry
to interrupt your class

15:32.682 --> 15:35.057
but it's an emergency.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.642
What's wrong?

15:36.644 --> 15:37.977
It's my daughter.

15:37.979 --> 15:41.980
She's a little stingray and
she's lost.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.608
Have you seen her?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.525
Lost?

15:44.527 --> 15:45.693
Yes!

15:45.695 --> 15:48.695
We're on a field trip
to visit a sunken ship.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.364
If we see a little
stingray we will

15:50.366 --> 15:54.160
make sure she gets home safely.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.244
We are very worried.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.206
ALL: Oh no!

15:59.167 --> 16:00.583
What is her name?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.709
Her name is Cherie.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.924
She is too little to be out
in the ocean all by herself.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.259
Don't worry, we'll find her!

16:11.261 --> 16:13.263
Yes, we will find her.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.226
ALL: We will find Cherie!

16:18.061 --> 16:19.896
Thank you so much.

16:24.274 --> 16:28.569
I think I can help find
Cherie, the lost stingray.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.778
You can?

16:29.780 --> 16:33.241
How can you help us
find a lost stingray?

16:33.243 --> 16:36.618
I am a detective.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.661
Really?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.122
Tell us more.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.543
My name is Petal and
I'm a sea turtle.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.464
Some turtles are semi, uh,
semiaqua...

16:51.802 --> 16:53.176
Semiaquatic?

16:53.178 --> 16:55.095
Yeah, what you just said.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.432
I'm that too!

16:57.142 --> 17:01.685
Sea turtles are reptiles,
I can breathe underwater.

17:01.687 --> 17:06.023
I can also crawl onto the
land and let my hard turtle

17:06.026 --> 17:07.902
shell soak up some sun.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.612
That's right, Petal.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.489
Some turtles live part
of the time in the sea

17:14.491 --> 17:16.867
and part of the time on land.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.078
I can help find Cherie,
the lost stingray,

17:20.079 --> 17:22.748
because I'm not
just a detective,

17:22.750 --> 17:26.544
I am a very good detective.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.588
I can see you are very smart!

17:29.590 --> 17:31.716
How can we find Cherie?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.344
I'm going to solve
the mystery of Cherie,

17:34.346 --> 17:37.807
the missing stingray,
by looking for clues.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.226
That is a very good idea.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.062
We can all look for clues when

17:44.064 --> 17:46.189
we get closer
to the sunken ship.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.356
My name is Diesel,

17:47.358 --> 17:49.941
I can help find Cherie the
stingray, too.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.862
How can you help us
find Cherie?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.738
I'm a manta ray.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.534
I have a really flat body
so I can swim super fast.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.870
Can you swim fast, Alba?

18:00.872 --> 18:04.373
Yes, but, maybe not as fast as
you.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.209
I wanna be a singer.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.047
♪ A, E, I, O, U ♪

18:12.217 --> 18:14.844
Oh my, you sing beautifully!

18:17.096 --> 18:20.055
What a wonderful voice!

18:20.057 --> 18:22.266
I'm Chopper,
I'm an angler fish.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.894
I have really sharp teeth
like Professor Shark,

18:25.896 --> 18:28.271
only my teeth are long and thin.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.401
But don't worry,
I'm friendly too!

18:31.403 --> 18:33.236
I'm glad to hear that,
Chopper.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.530
I want to be a deep
sea diver like my dad

18:36.532 --> 18:38.742
and find buried treasures!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.495
Maybe we will find
buried treasure today!

18:42.497 --> 18:45.331
I'm Tang,
I'm a bright yellow fish.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.043
I have a really cool feathery
crested fin.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.712
I want to be a fish groomer.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.382
The sea needs
good fish groomers.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.299
What an interesting
group of fish.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.261
I'm really looking forward
to teaching you this year.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.971
Me too!

19:00.973 --> 19:03.975
I am lucky I was
sent to this class.

19:03.977 --> 19:04.978
ALL: Yay!

19:11.984 --> 19:14.317
Ahoy there, class Cove Four.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.653
(SQUEAKS)

19:16.655 --> 19:18.488
I'm Dudley Dolphin.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.241
I'm your tour guide today!

19:21.243 --> 19:23.952
I'm here to tell you
everything you want to know

19:23.954 --> 19:26.288
about sunken ships!

19:26.290 --> 19:28.208
ALL: Hi Dudley Dolphin!

19:29.419 --> 19:31.126
Professor Shark, Alba,

19:31.128 --> 19:33.546
is it okay if I ask your class

19:33.548 --> 19:36.382
a few questions
about sunken ships?

19:36.384 --> 19:37.883
Of course, Dudley.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.843
Proceed!

19:38.845 --> 19:41.554
Okie Dokie Doo,
my little troopers!

19:41.556 --> 19:45.226
Can any of you tell me
what is a sunken ship?

19:46.435 --> 19:49.895
It's a big boat lying at
the bottom of the ocean.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.521
(SQUEAKING)

19:51.523 --> 19:54.025
Yes, that is true!

19:54.027 --> 19:55.776
A sunken ship has
something to do

19:55.778 --> 19:58.112
with the creatures
called people.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.949
You know, the ones that
live on top of the water.

20:01.951 --> 20:02.786
People!

20:04.328 --> 20:05.329
People.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.417
All those earthy creatures
with skin!

20:12.461 --> 20:15.505
People have really
long flippers

20:15.507 --> 20:18.257
that smack the water
when they try to swim.

20:18.259 --> 20:22.053
They move all around but
they don't get very far.

20:22.055 --> 20:22.886
(LAUGHS)

20:22.888 --> 20:23.722
People!

20:25.307 --> 20:26.142
People.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.688
Earthy creatures.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.315
People don't have flippers,
Petal, they have arms.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.526
(LAUGHS)

20:36.528 --> 20:37.442
Arms?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.696
That's a funny word.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.282
ALL: People arms?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.660
People arms flop and
splash because people

20:45.662 --> 20:48.871
have to keep their heads above
water so they can breathe.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.668
Oooweee!

20:52.126 --> 20:58.506
This is one smart
(STUTTERS) class!

20:58.508 --> 21:00.924
Why are we talking
about people?

21:00.926 --> 21:04.554
What do people have to
do with sunken ships?

21:04.556 --> 21:08.391
People can't breathe
underwater so they build ships.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.226
(SQUEAKING)

21:10.228 --> 21:15.523
Oh correctamundo, oh
smart fish in the sea.

21:15.525 --> 21:22.947
People build ships to
(STUTTERS) sail across the sea.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.408
If the ship sails on top of
the water

21:25.410 --> 21:27.744
how come we're going
to visit a sunken ship

21:27.746 --> 21:29.871
lying at the bottom of the sea?

21:29.873 --> 21:31.456
How did it get there?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.415
(LAUGHS)

21:33.417 --> 21:36.501
That is a most excellent
question.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.421
People do build boats to
sail on top of the water

21:39.423 --> 21:43.843
but sometimes boats don't
stay on top of the water.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.845
They sink to the bottom
of the sea.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.389
Why do ships sink?

21:48.391 --> 21:51.308
Don't people know how to keep
ships on top of the water?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.143
There are many
reasons ships sink

21:53.145 --> 21:55.103
to the bottom of the ocean.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.607
Strong storm winds can blow
a ship in the wrong direction

21:58.609 --> 22:00.526
and people get lost.

22:00.528 --> 22:05.030
I would not like to
get lost in the ocean.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.490
Me too, Fifi.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.744
It would be scary to be
all alone in the ocean.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.538
Scary!

22:13.124 --> 22:15.624
I'll tell you something scary:

22:15.626 --> 22:18.379
lightning can break
a ship into two!

22:20.382 --> 22:23.968
Even scarier: the bottom
of the ship can hit

22:25.053 --> 22:28.095
a rock that people don't see!

22:28.097 --> 22:32.683
A rock punches a hole in
the boat and the boat sinks.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.772
And scariest of all,
sometimes ships get attacked

22:38.400 --> 22:40.192
by angry sea monsters!

22:42.444 --> 22:43.777
ALL: Sea monsters?

22:43.779 --> 22:45.321
Don't worry!

22:45.323 --> 22:48.074
We're not going to
see any sea monsters.

22:48.076 --> 22:52.120
Do sea monsters
live in sunken ships?

22:52.122 --> 22:55.248
They doodley doodley
doodley do!

22:55.250 --> 22:58.543
Dudley Dolphin, you're
scaring my students!

22:58.545 --> 23:01.339
Sorry!

23:01.923 --> 23:03.256
Don't be frightened.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.424
Mostly we are going to see fish,

23:05.426 --> 23:09.970
all kinds of fish live in
and around sunken ships.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.972
Maybe one of
the fish that lives

23:11.974 --> 23:14.726
in the sunken ship saw Cherie.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.144
I heard about that
little lost fish.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.565
I hope the sea monsters
don't eat her.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.526
Sea monsters eat fish?

23:23.528 --> 23:26.988
(GASPS)

23:26.990 --> 23:28.905
Oopa Oopa Oopsy!

23:28.907 --> 23:30.074
(LAUGHS)

23:30.076 --> 23:31.161
Did it again.

23:32.077 --> 23:36.497
Are there a lot of
sunken ships in the ocean?

23:36.499 --> 23:37.789
Millions!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.374
Millions?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.628
That's a really big number.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.298
Are there a
million sea monsters?

23:46.300 --> 23:48.676
I can't even count to a million!

23:48.678 --> 23:52.013
I think we've heard
enough about sea monsters.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.514
Okie Dokie Doo.

23:53.516 --> 23:54.849
(LAUGHS)

23:54.851 --> 23:58.769
The tour is almost through
and you lucky buckaroos

23:58.771 --> 24:01.104
are about to see a sunken ship

24:01.106 --> 24:04.441
at the bottom of the ocean blue.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.486
ALL: Hooray!

24:06.988 --> 24:08.571
Thank you Dudley Dolphin.

24:08.573 --> 24:11.157
We will swim the class
the rest of the way.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.660
ALL: Bye Dudley!

24:14.203 --> 24:16.536
G'day my little baddoos.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.082
Stay safe, swim two-by-two,

24:19.084 --> 24:21.795
or the sea monsters
will eat you.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.588
NARRATOR: The students
continue their fun field trip

24:26.590 --> 24:30.468
thinking of sea monsters and
sunken ships.

24:30.470 --> 24:34.055
Will there be any sea
monsters that eat little fish

24:34.057 --> 24:36.556
on the sunken ship, Alba?

24:36.558 --> 24:38.267
Of course not.

24:38.269 --> 24:41.562
Dudley Dolphin
is just being silly.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.565
Sea monsters do not
eat little fish, Fifi,

24:44.567 --> 24:46.776
but we do need to swim together.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.236
There are some sharks,

24:48.238 --> 24:52.280
including one very goofy
Toothy Magrue who might.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.617
Let's not think about
sea monsters and sharks.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.706
Let's be on the lookout for
that little missing stingray.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.625
She must be really scared.

25:02.876 --> 25:07.296
Don't worry, Alba, I,
the great Inspector Petal,

25:07.298 --> 25:12.634
am going to find Cherie and
everyone is going to help me.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.637
ALL: Yay!

25:14.638 --> 25:17.931
I'm Inspector Petal's
assistant, Doctor Kiki.

25:17.933 --> 25:21.059
I think we should start
looking for clues.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.688
Good idea, Kiki.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.149
What are clues,
Inspector Petal?

25:26.151 --> 25:28.484
Clues are important
that we find

25:28.486 --> 25:30.652
to help us solve a mystery.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.530
I will look
very closely at everything

25:33.532 --> 25:35.991
in and around the sunken ship!

25:35.993 --> 25:37.786
We will find Cherie.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.164
Lily and I will help you.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.709
NARRATOR: Everyone
stares at the sunken ship.

25:44.711 --> 25:48.462
It is big and shiny,
the top of it dips,

25:48.464 --> 25:51.466
one object catches all their
fish eyes:

25:51.468 --> 25:55.761
a trail made of lots of
gold coins that shine.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.430
Look at all these gold coins.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.307
How did they get here?

26:00.309 --> 26:03.061
Fish play, my dear Tang.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.688
Inspector Petal is here to solve

26:05.690 --> 26:08.067
the mystery of the gold coins.

26:09.193 --> 26:11.526
What do you think,
Inspector Petal?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.696
Do you see any clues?

26:13.698 --> 26:14.822
(LAUGHS)

26:14.824 --> 26:15.948
Hmm.

26:15.950 --> 26:20.119
I think the sunken ship
is a clue, Doctor Kiki.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.746
The sunken ship is a clue?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.790
That is a really big clue!

26:24.792 --> 26:27.794
It is, but look, Doctor Kiki,

26:27.796 --> 26:30.921
there are some coins
on that deck,

26:30.923 --> 26:33.632
on the main part of the boat!

26:33.634 --> 26:36.885
(CHEERS)

26:36.887 --> 26:39.138
The main part of the
boat is called the hull,

26:39.140 --> 26:40.765
right Professor Shark?

26:40.767 --> 26:42.141
That's right, Diesel!

26:42.143 --> 26:45.603
The main part of a boat is
called a hull.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.729
Continue, Inspector Petal.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.232
See those gold coins
in the hull?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.111
The coins left a trail.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.863
A trail that leads from the
boat to the sandy bottom.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.992
(CHEERS)

27:00.286 --> 27:04.287
I do see a trail of gold
coins, Inspector Petal.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.039
Then you can see that the
treasure chest

27:06.041 --> 27:08.625
fell off the ship when it sunk.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.336
It fell off the ship and hit
the ground.

27:11.338 --> 27:14.465
It hit the ground
and broke open.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.592
And that is why there's a
trail of coins

27:16.594 --> 27:19.386
on the sandy bottom near the
sunken ship.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.847
You did it again,
Inspector Petal!

27:21.849 --> 27:23.975
You solved the mystery.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.768
Fish play, my dear Fifi.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.063
ALL: Hooray!

27:30.442 --> 27:34.401
Now we know why the treasure
chest landed on the ground.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.278
Yes we do, Tang.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.492
Very good, Petal, you are going
to make a great detective.

27:41.786 --> 27:42.869
(LAUGHS)

27:42.871 --> 27:44.828
Petal, I don't think
I've ever met

27:44.830 --> 27:47.498
such a smart sea turtle.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.334
Shall we explore some more?

27:49.336 --> 27:50.918
ALL: Hooray!

27:50.920 --> 27:52.547
Let's go inside.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.757
NARRATOR: Time to
explore the sunken ship.

27:56.759 --> 28:01.679
There are plants, and wheels,
and chairs, and boots.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.641
There's pictures of pirates,
world globes, and maps.

28:05.643 --> 28:08.393
They even found a captain's hat.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.439
Chains and masts,
gold on the floor,

28:11.441 --> 28:16.026
but wait, they're about
to discover so much more.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.737
Wow.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.738
So much to look at.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.949
What's that, Professor Shark?

28:21.951 --> 28:24.786
It's called a globe.

28:24.788 --> 28:28.583
It shows all the land
and oceans of the Earth.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.708
What's the Earth?

28:30.710 --> 28:31.959
It's where we live!

28:31.961 --> 28:35.921
That globe looks like a
ball I use to play soccer.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.298
(LAUGHS)

28:38.300 --> 28:39.510
What's that?

28:41.304 --> 28:43.179
That is a pirate.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.639
What's a pirate?

28:44.641 --> 28:47.225
It's a people that lives above
the sea,

28:47.227 --> 28:48.934
right Professor Shark?

28:48.936 --> 28:49.936
That's right, Lily.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.563
A pirate is a person that sails
the sea

28:52.565 --> 28:55.900
looking for gold and treasure.

28:55.902 --> 29:00.113
Looks like this pirate
found a lot of gold.

29:00.115 --> 29:02.949
Or maybe sea monsters
leave a trail

29:02.951 --> 29:04.909
of gold coins for little fish
like us

29:04.911 --> 29:08.746
to follow when we're
inside the sunken ship

29:08.748 --> 29:09.831
so they can eat us!

29:09.833 --> 29:11.915
(SHRIEKS)

29:11.917 --> 29:14.001
Don't worry guys, I'll
poke the sea monsters

29:14.003 --> 29:15.713
with my sword nose.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.722
Did you see that?

29:26.849 --> 29:28.017
Something moved!

29:28.852 --> 29:30.934
I did see something move.

29:30.936 --> 29:42.613
Do you think it's a sea monster?

29:42.615 --> 29:44.032
(YELLS)

29:44.034 --> 29:46.076
(GURGLING)

29:51.790 --> 29:53.333
Hurry Fifi, swim faster.

29:53.335 --> 29:56.169
Don't let the
sea monster catch us!

29:56.171 --> 29:59.087
FIFI: I'm swimming
as fast as I can!

29:59.089 --> 30:01.090
LILY: That sea
monster's right behind us.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.549
What are we going to do?

30:02.551 --> 30:03.551
FIFI: I don't know.

30:03.553 --> 30:06.304
We are swimming away from the
sunken ship.

30:06.306 --> 30:09.431
I don't see anyone
from the class.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.017
I don't see anything but...

30:11.019 --> 30:13.894
LILY: Open ocean!

30:13.896 --> 30:15.771
Quick, in here.

30:15.773 --> 30:16.607
Follow me.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.401
(GURGLING)

30:20.403 --> 30:22.614
We lost the sea monster.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.240
Yay!

30:25.032 --> 30:26.657
Are you Cherie?

30:26.659 --> 30:29.117
Yes, how did you know?

30:29.119 --> 30:32.205
Your mama and papa
are looking for you.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.123
Everyone is looking for you!

30:34.125 --> 30:35.792
They are very worried.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.544
I miss my mama and papa.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.462
How did you get lost?

30:40.464 --> 30:42.422
I was swimming near
the sunken ship

30:42.424 --> 30:45.884
when a sea monster started to
chase me.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.847
He was yellow with
sharp pointy teeth.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.975
And one eye is bigger
than the other eye?

30:52.977 --> 30:56.019
That sea monster chased us too.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.981
The sea monster chased
me and I swam so far

30:59.983 --> 31:04.069
I could not find my way
back to the sunken ship.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.197
That is what happened to us.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.740
Have you been hiding in
this cave the whole time?

31:08.742 --> 31:11.827
No, I swam through
the cave and found

31:11.829 --> 31:13.996
an opening on the other side.

31:13.998 --> 31:17.874
I swam through that opening
and this funny looking shark

31:17.876 --> 31:19.461
started to chase me!

31:20.296 --> 31:23.797
First you were chased by a
sea monster then by a shark?

31:23.799 --> 31:26.260
It has been a very crazy day.

31:27.429 --> 31:29.219
Then what happened?

31:29.221 --> 31:32.140
I swam back into this
cave which is too small

31:32.142 --> 31:34.057
for the shark to fit in.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.184
Where did you see my
mama and papa?

31:36.186 --> 31:39.439
We were on our way
to see a sunken ship.

31:39.441 --> 31:41.524
We are on a field trip.

31:41.526 --> 31:45.527
It is the first day of
school and Professor Shark...

31:45.529 --> 31:47.029
A shark?

31:47.031 --> 31:48.864
He is a friendly shark.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.950
The best teacher in the whole
wide sea.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.997
(GURGLING)

31:55.874 --> 31:58.290
Oh no, it's the sea monster!

31:58.292 --> 31:59.793
Quick, follow me.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.171
Do you know where we are?

32:04.173 --> 32:08.551
I'm not allowed to swim
this far from Fishtail Reef.

32:08.553 --> 32:12.013
Do you know where we are, Lily?

32:12.015 --> 32:16.183
No, I have never explored
the sea beyond Fishtail Reef.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.393
My mother told me
a lot of sea animals

32:18.395 --> 32:22.399
that live in open ocean
like to eat little fish.

32:25.403 --> 32:27.697
(GROANING)

32:34.203 --> 32:41.834
Oh look, three adorable
little fish baits.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.169
Fish baits?

32:43.171 --> 32:45.006
(LAUGHS)

32:46.340 --> 32:47.590
Fish baits.

32:47.592 --> 32:51.054
If you don't wanna
catch anything very big.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.180
What's wrong?

32:54.182 --> 32:56.809
I have a terrible toothache.

32:57.935 --> 32:58.769
Very bad.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.021
Very painful!

33:02.648 --> 33:08.862
It's from the top of my fin
to the bottom of my tail.

33:10.115 --> 33:10.947
Which tooth?

33:10.949 --> 33:12.198
You have so many.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.409
Can we do anything to help?

33:14.411 --> 33:15.245
Help me?

33:16.328 --> 33:19.832
Ha, you little fish bait want to
help me?

34:03.999 --> 34:06.044
(GROANS)

34:06.046 --> 34:09.713
my tooth is killing me.

34:09.715 --> 34:13.382
I have a row of flat
round teeth to eat

34:13.385 --> 34:15.927
little fish along the reef.

34:15.929 --> 34:19.639
I have rows of sharp teeth
that cut through bone

34:19.641 --> 34:23.855
and those are the ones that
are making me moan and groan.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.565
(GROANING)

34:29.568 --> 34:32.737
It must've been
that big pile of garbage

34:32.739 --> 34:34.322
I ate this morning.

34:34.324 --> 34:37.239
I was so hungry I
just chomped into it.

34:37.242 --> 34:41.036
It had a lot of bones,
must've got a big sharp bone

34:41.039 --> 34:43.581
caught between my teeth.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.376
I have thought of
becoming a vegetarian

34:46.378 --> 34:49.210
but the meat side argues
with the veggie side.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.338
(LAUGHS)

34:51.340 --> 34:55.885
The only good thing is I
might lose some weight.

34:55.887 --> 34:58.304
Do you think I'm fat?

34:58.306 --> 35:02.559
I try to watch my weight
but I love food.

35:03.353 --> 35:08.271
I have heard that sharks
grow back their teeth.

35:08.273 --> 35:12.150
We do, but I got something
stuck right

35:12.152 --> 35:14.446
between these two right here.

35:16.282 --> 35:19.409
Called the shark dentist,
he can't be reached.

35:19.411 --> 35:20.909
He's playing the back nine on

35:20.911 --> 35:23.496
the underwater fish
croquet course.

35:23.498 --> 35:26.708
And the pilot fish, they
usually clean my teeth,

35:26.710 --> 35:29.503
but they're on
vacation in Hawaii.

35:30.838 --> 35:33.380
Poor Toothy Magrue.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.800
Maybe we can help you get rid
of the teeth that hurt you.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.554
How can you help me?

35:39.806 --> 35:42.264
I heard Professor Shark
once bit down

35:42.266 --> 35:45.934
on a seaweed sandwich and broke
a tooth.

35:45.936 --> 35:49.771
A really hard little rock
fell into the seaweed

35:49.773 --> 35:52.441
and his tooth fell out.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.487
Professor Shark, you say?

35:55.864 --> 35:56.820
He's our teacher.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.574
He's the best teacher
in all the ocean.

35:59.576 --> 36:02.452
He took us on a field
trip to the sunken ship

36:02.454 --> 36:05.371
on our very first day of school.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.248
(LAUGHS)

36:07.250 --> 36:11.338
Well well well, my old
friend, Professor Shark.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.840
Still teaching little sea
animals in Fishtail Reef.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.927
He bit down on a hard rock,
you say?

36:19.929 --> 36:22.554
It was a whale of a
fish story.

36:22.556 --> 36:24.807
A big deal in the reef!

36:24.809 --> 36:27.642
Everybody wanted that tooth.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.271
Shark teeth bring fish luck.

36:30.273 --> 36:32.190
Of course they do!

36:32.192 --> 36:36.860
I saw some very hard
rocks outside the sea cave.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.947
(GROANS)

36:45.789 --> 36:50.333
Well, well, well, my little
fish bait,

36:50.335 --> 36:53.211
you did help me after all.

36:53.213 --> 36:57.382
You gave me a good idea,
I'm going to find a rock

36:57.384 --> 36:58.842
and bite down hard.

36:59.677 --> 37:03.347
Since we helped you,
maybe you can help us.

37:04.849 --> 37:08.016
Do you know how we can
find the sunken ship?

37:08.018 --> 37:09.019
We are lost.

37:10.396 --> 37:13.106
Oh, lost little fish bait.

37:13.108 --> 37:15.066
Sorry, can't help ya.

37:15.068 --> 37:19.153
Haven't seen a sunken
ship in quite awhile.

37:19.155 --> 37:23.074
If you're lost, I can't let you
swim here,

37:23.076 --> 37:24.909
you'll have to take
your little fins

37:24.911 --> 37:27.704
right back through
that sea cave.

37:27.706 --> 37:29.079
Why?

37:29.081 --> 37:32.249
One of the sharks is
having a birthday party.

37:32.251 --> 37:36.045
There's lots and lots of
sharks swimming all around here

37:36.047 --> 37:38.255
and they aren't
friendly like me.

37:38.257 --> 37:42.635
You mean they
don't have toothaches.

37:42.637 --> 37:48.057
Exactly, they have
hungry, rumbling bellies.

37:48.059 --> 37:50.559
Hungry, rumbling bellies?

37:50.561 --> 37:53.229
We had better swim
back into the cave.

37:53.231 --> 37:55.063
Thanks, Toothy!

37:55.065 --> 37:56.983
Had a blast,
little fish baits.

37:56.985 --> 37:59.193
Hope you find the sunken ship.

37:59.195 --> 38:03.280
When you see Professor
Shark tell him he owes me.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.449
Owes you?

38:04.451 --> 38:07.075
For not eating his students.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.163
(LAUGHS)

38:14.501 --> 38:17.087
Oh, we are stuck in this cave.

38:18.297 --> 38:21.548
If we go that way
there are sharks.

38:21.550 --> 38:25.054
If we go this way
there are sea monsters.

38:26.181 --> 38:29.514
And we are lost, we don't
know where the sunken ship is.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.892
What are we going to do?

38:31.894 --> 38:33.269
I don't know.

38:33.271 --> 38:35.479
This is all your fault, Fifi.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.523
You saw something
moving in the seaweed

38:37.525 --> 38:39.775
and we stopped swimming
with the class.

38:39.777 --> 38:43.445
Professor Shark said we should
stay together at all times.

38:43.447 --> 38:44.697
We didn't listen!

38:44.699 --> 38:48.367
You did not have to look
at the seaweed with me.

38:48.369 --> 38:51.162
You could've kept swimming with
the class.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.954
I did not know we were going to

38:52.956 --> 38:55.958
be chased by a sea monster!

38:55.960 --> 38:59.628
Fifi and Lily, I am so
happy you were brave enough

38:59.630 --> 39:02.382
to look in the moving seaweed.

39:02.384 --> 39:05.842
I am happy you were
chased by a sea monster.

39:05.844 --> 39:10.097
Why are you happy we were
chased by a sea monster?

39:10.099 --> 39:12.182
That is how you found me!

39:12.184 --> 39:14.894
Thank you so much
for finding me.

39:14.896 --> 39:17.938
I was very afraid to be alone.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.441
I'm glad we found you too,
Cherie.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.195
It is scary out here.

39:24.197 --> 39:26.197
I'm glad we are together too.

39:26.199 --> 39:28.740
Three sea animals
are stronger than one.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.534
We will figure this out
together.

39:30.536 --> 39:33.539
I agree, Lily,
and I have an idea!

39:35.083 --> 39:36.958
What is your idea, Fifi?

39:36.960 --> 39:40.547
Okay, we will swim
to the end of the cave.

39:41.463 --> 39:45.967
When we get there, Lily
will use her special sonar

39:45.969 --> 39:48.469
to call the sea monster,

39:48.471 --> 39:52.684
she can also make a loud
(MOANING)

39:53.601 --> 39:57.814
I understand why you
want me to (MOANING).

40:01.525 --> 40:03.943
Whale calls can be
heard from far away.

40:03.945 --> 40:08.488
Professor Shark and Alba
will hear me (MOANING)

40:08.490 --> 40:09.990
and come save us!

40:09.992 --> 40:12.075
That is a good idea.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.537
But why do you want
me to use my sonar

40:14.539 --> 40:17.248
to call the sea monster
into the cave?

40:17.250 --> 40:21.001
Well, I thought if the
sea monster chases us

40:21.003 --> 40:23.545
we could swim to the
other end of the cave.

40:23.547 --> 40:27.300
Then the sea monster will
follow us out of the cave exit

40:27.302 --> 40:30.802
where Toothy and all the
other sharks are swimming.

40:30.804 --> 40:32.097
Oh, I get it.

40:33.557 --> 40:36.601
The sharks will see the
sea monster and chase him.

40:36.603 --> 40:38.519
Sharks would much rather
eat a sea monster

40:38.521 --> 40:42.106
than little old fish bait like
us, right?

40:42.108 --> 40:43.648
Right!

40:43.650 --> 40:47.695
The sharks will chase the sea
monster and leave us alone.

40:47.697 --> 40:49.572
That is a great plan, Fifi.

40:49.574 --> 40:51.157
You are so smart.

40:51.159 --> 40:55.036
That is why you're my best
friend in the whole ocean.

40:55.038 --> 40:58.664
And you're my best
friend in the entire sea!

40:58.666 --> 41:00.791
How about me?

41:00.793 --> 41:03.336
You are our friend too,
Cherie.

41:03.338 --> 41:07.342
Our new best friend,
and that is very special.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.385
Where are you from, Cherie?

41:10.387 --> 41:13.554
I am from a reef far far away.

41:13.556 --> 41:15.305
We just moved here.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.307
What is it like in your reef,
Cherie?

41:17.309 --> 41:19.726
It is a bit warmer
and greener.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.188
You live in the sunken ship?

41:22.190 --> 41:24.691
Yes, I am a stingray.

41:24.693 --> 41:28.610
My parents said it is good
to live in a sunken ship.

41:28.612 --> 41:31.280
There are some yummy
plants to eat.

41:31.282 --> 41:34.075
There are also many
plants that are soft

41:34.077 --> 41:36.619
and make a nice bed to sleep on.

41:36.621 --> 41:38.704
You are a stingray?

41:38.706 --> 41:43.709
We have a manta ray in our
class, his name is Diesel.

41:43.711 --> 41:45.670
He sings really good.

41:45.672 --> 41:46.713
(LAUGHS)

41:46.715 --> 41:48.213
Do you sing, Cherie?

41:48.215 --> 41:52.802
I sing sometimes but then
all the fish swim away.

41:52.804 --> 41:54.137
(LAUGHS)

41:54.139 --> 41:57.682
Stingrays are like manta
rays but I have a stinger

41:57.684 --> 41:59.766
at the end of my tail.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.644
I come from a place where
there are lots of stingrays.

42:02.646 --> 42:05.398
You are both in the same class
at school?

42:05.400 --> 42:10.610
Yes, we are on a field trip
with our class right now.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.322
Except we are lost.

42:14.242 --> 42:15.657
We are from class Cove Four,

42:15.659 --> 42:18.494
the best class in all the ocean.

42:18.496 --> 42:23.833
I have friends in my reef
but they live far far away now.

42:23.835 --> 42:26.626
We are your new best friends.

42:26.628 --> 42:30.298
Yes, let's all three
of us be best friends.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.798
When we're together...

42:31.800 --> 42:33.342
Everything is better!

42:33.344 --> 42:35.345
Got to stick together...

42:35.347 --> 42:37.637
Through sun and
stormy weather...

42:37.639 --> 42:39.849
Even when we're chased
by sharks?

42:39.851 --> 42:41.934
Even when we're chased
by sharks.

42:41.936 --> 42:44.019
Best friends forever!

42:44.021 --> 42:46.396
Even when we're lost at sea?

42:46.398 --> 42:48.816
Even when we're lost at sea.

42:48.818 --> 42:50.735
Best friends forever.

42:50.737 --> 42:53.070
Will you always remember me?

42:53.072 --> 42:55.572
Yes, I'll always remember you.

42:55.574 --> 42:58.492
What if I live in a
dirty old shoe?

42:58.494 --> 43:00.288
Gotta stay together.

43:01.456 --> 43:03.333
Best friends forever.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.169
(MOANING)

43:11.423 --> 43:16.052
That sounded like one,
two, three, four, five,

43:16.054 --> 43:18.720
six, seven, eight...

43:18.722 --> 43:20.514
Only eight!

43:20.516 --> 43:22.766
We are missing two.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.061
Where's Fifi and Lily?

43:25.063 --> 43:26.269
(GASPS)

43:26.271 --> 43:28.523
They were swimming right in
front of me.

43:28.525 --> 43:30.191
They were swimming
in front of you

43:30.193 --> 43:31.733
but when I asked you a
question...

43:31.735 --> 43:32.862
I remember!

43:33.905 --> 43:36.072
You asked me a question
about the sunken ship's

43:36.074 --> 43:39.700
steering wheel and I (STUTTERS)

43:39.702 --> 43:43.121
I don't know what
happened to Fifi and Lily.

43:43.123 --> 43:45.373
It's okay, Alba,
we'll find them.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.458
I just heard Lily
send a sonar call.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.668
She sounded far away.

43:49.670 --> 43:52.838
Another mystery
for Inspector Petal.

43:52.840 --> 43:57.260
We must find our lost
classmates right away.

43:57.262 --> 43:59.387
Let's look for clues.

43:59.389 --> 44:01.222
That's a good idea, Petal.

44:01.224 --> 44:05.226
We will swim back through
the ship and look for clues.

44:05.228 --> 44:09.731
I hope Professor Shark and
Alba heard all my (MOANS).

44:09.733 --> 44:14.568
Me too, but don't worry,
Lily, we will be okay.

44:14.570 --> 44:17.405
First we will help our
new best friend, Cherie,

44:17.407 --> 44:19.282
get back to the sunken ship.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.784
Then we will find our
way back to Fishtail Reef.

44:21.786 --> 44:24.871
I would like to visit
you in Fishtail Reef.

44:24.873 --> 44:26.079
You will!

44:26.081 --> 44:27.831
Best friends forever.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.916
Best friends forever.

44:29.918 --> 44:32.254
(GURGLING)

44:33.088 --> 44:35.840
How away a sea monster!

44:35.842 --> 44:38.467
(GURGLING)

44:38.469 --> 44:41.387
(TOOTHY LAUGHS)

44:41.389 --> 44:44.807
You're afraid of this guy?

44:44.809 --> 44:47.769
Have you taken
a good look at him?

44:47.771 --> 44:49.689
Let me introduce Glurp.

44:50.815 --> 44:52.858
(GURGLING)

44:54.485 --> 44:57.695
He's sayin'
hi in sea monster talk.

44:57.697 --> 44:59.574
You talk sea monster?

45:00.492 --> 45:04.702
Of course, don't know what
the brainy Professor Shark

45:04.704 --> 45:07.621
taught ya, but let me, Toothy,

45:07.623 --> 45:10.999
teach you a little bit
about sea monsters.

45:11.001 --> 45:13.045
Sea monsters are not scary.

45:14.755 --> 45:16.296
They're not?

45:16.298 --> 45:17.798
Not anymore.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.344
They used to be, well, monsters.

45:21.804 --> 45:25.014
Scaring and eating all the
little fish

45:25.016 --> 45:26.516
then a whale...

45:26.518 --> 45:27.849
Like me.

45:27.851 --> 45:30.436
Like you but bigger.

45:30.438 --> 45:32.604
Started feeding 'em
and petting 'em

45:32.606 --> 45:37.070
and slowly, I mean very slowly,

45:37.487 --> 45:39.487
like a few hundred years later,

45:39.489 --> 45:43.032
sea monsters turned from
wild sea animals

45:43.034 --> 45:44.869
into big floppy sea pets.

45:46.704 --> 45:47.871
Sea pets?

45:48.664 --> 45:52.374
We heard sea monsters
like to eat little fish.

45:52.376 --> 45:55.086
Most sea monsters are tame.

45:55.088 --> 45:59.259
Like I said, we fish turned
'em into cute little pets.

46:00.260 --> 46:03.219
There are a few wild
ones left in the sea.

46:03.221 --> 46:06.054
Those guys will eat ya.

46:06.056 --> 46:09.891
They'll eat anything,
even sharks.

46:09.893 --> 46:14.063
Those sea monsters are
called goonches.

46:14.065 --> 46:17.360
They're a lot bigger and very
very strong

46:19.862 --> 46:22.612
but there aren't many
of 'em left.

46:22.614 --> 46:23.865
Goonches?

46:23.867 --> 46:25.867
My papa said...

46:25.869 --> 46:27.912
(GURGLING)

46:29.456 --> 46:33.458
Calm down, there are no
goonches here.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.293
Pet sea monsters don't like
ya to talk

46:36.295 --> 46:38.505
about their nasty cousins.

46:39.465 --> 46:44.594
(GROANING)

46:44.596 --> 46:46.889
My tooth is still killing me.

46:48.807 --> 46:52.351
I tried biting on a rock,
didn't help me at all.

46:52.353 --> 46:54.772
My tooth won't stop hurtin'!

46:55.690 --> 46:56.813
Hey.

47:11.081 --> 47:13.539
What are you talking about,
Toothy?

47:13.541 --> 47:16.376
Sea monsters eat weird
stuff like barnacles

47:16.378 --> 47:19.003
and mold and all kinda parasites

47:19.005 --> 47:21.923
that no one else wants
to put near their mouth.

47:21.925 --> 47:25.260
These guys, nasty stuff is yum
to them.

47:27.347 --> 47:29.930
So I asked Glurp here if he
could remove

47:29.932 --> 47:33.476
that pesky bone from
between my teeth.

47:33.478 --> 47:34.936
Can he?

47:34.938 --> 47:35.978
Yes!

47:35.980 --> 47:37.563
ALL: Yay!

47:37.565 --> 47:40.273
Sea monsters are
our new friends.

47:40.275 --> 47:43.485
Toothy Magrue is our new
friend too.

47:43.487 --> 47:44.320

this bone outta my tooth.

(GURGLING)

48:43.172 --> 48:44.130
He will!

48:44.132 --> 48:47.300
And we're gonna find our
way back to the sunken ship.

48:47.302 --> 48:50.094
If I were lookin'
for a sunken ship

48:50.096 --> 48:52.637
I'd go see the sardines.

48:52.639 --> 48:54.557
Those guys are like sea maps,

48:54.559 --> 48:57.354
they know every
inch of this reef.

48:59.230 --> 49:01.981
What is it like to
live in Fishtail Reef?

49:01.983 --> 49:05.693
It is the best place
in the ocean!

49:05.695 --> 49:10.113
We have our own merry-go-round
and the best school.

49:10.115 --> 49:12.032
All the sea animals come to
our school:

49:12.034 --> 49:16.204
sea horses, pufferfish,
turtles, manta rays.

49:16.206 --> 49:18.246
And whales like you?

49:18.248 --> 49:21.919
Hey, didn't we pass
this exact rock before?

49:23.088 --> 49:25.796
Oh no, are we swimming
in circles?

49:25.798 --> 49:28.090
We'll never get home that way.

49:28.092 --> 49:31.719
What would Inspector
Petal and Doctor Kiki do?

49:31.721 --> 49:33.679
They would find the
sardines and ask them

49:33.681 --> 49:36.724
to show them the way
back to the sunken ship.

49:36.726 --> 49:38.976
Who is Petal and Kiki?

49:38.978 --> 49:40.811
They're in our class.

49:40.813 --> 49:43.815
Petal is a sea turtle,
Kiki is a pufferfish.

49:43.817 --> 49:45.441
Soon you will meet them too.

49:45.443 --> 49:50.153
They play a game about
how to solve mysteries.

49:50.155 --> 49:52.699
That sounds like fun.

49:52.701 --> 49:56.161
We are lost in the sea,
we are the mystery.

49:57.288 --> 49:59.079
Let's find those sardines!

49:59.081 --> 50:01.458
(LIGHT MUSIC)

50:12.344 --> 50:16.557
Look, Doctor Kiki, I see
something moving in the seaweed.

50:21.521 --> 50:24.229
Yes, there is something
moving in the seaweed!

50:24.231 --> 50:26.567
(GURGLING)

50:31.905 --> 50:33.280
What's that?

50:33.282 --> 50:35.450
It's a baby sea monster.

50:35.452 --> 50:38.327
He's a tootie badootie cutie.

50:38.329 --> 50:40.871
He doesn't look big
enough to eat us.

50:40.873 --> 50:43.081
He's a baby sea monster.

50:43.083 --> 50:45.169
(GURGLING)

50:47.255 --> 50:49.296
Sea monsters don't eat fish.

50:49.298 --> 50:52.133
They want to be our friends.

50:52.135 --> 50:54.179
(GURGLING)

50:55.679 --> 50:58.097
His name is Slurp,
he's saying that he saw

50:58.099 --> 51:00.432
his cousin Glurp
follow a pink fish

51:00.434 --> 51:04.269
and a blue whale
into the open ocean.

51:04.271 --> 51:05.313
The open ocean?

51:05.315 --> 51:06.731
Oh no!

51:06.733 --> 51:09.358
You speak sea monster?

51:09.360 --> 51:10.193
Yes.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.401
Let's go class, quickly!

51:11.403 --> 51:13.320
Slurp said they went this way.

51:13.322 --> 51:16.365
What do you know
about sardines?

51:16.367 --> 51:18.534
Grandma whale said
sardines swim close together

51:18.536 --> 51:20.036
because it is safer.

51:20.038 --> 51:24.081
They are little fish and many
sea animals like to eat them.

51:24.083 --> 51:25.499
School?

51:25.501 --> 51:26.835
Sardine school?

51:27.795 --> 51:30.463
Why do sardines
swim close together?

51:30.465 --> 51:33.173
Grandma whale said
sardines swim close together

51:33.175 --> 51:34.425
because it is safer.

51:34.427 --> 51:38.179
They are little fish and many
sea animals like to eat them.

51:38.181 --> 51:39.222
(CHUCKLES)

51:39.224 --> 51:41.474
It's easy to catch one
sardine,

51:41.476 --> 51:45.478
but not very easy to catch
a big ball of sardines.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.563
I can't wait to meet them.

51:47.565 --> 51:50.150
Do you think they'll talk to us?

51:55.739 --> 51:56.740
Hi sardines!

51:57.617 --> 51:59.282
My name is Fifi.

51:59.284 --> 52:03.498
I'm sorry to disturb your
beautiful dance but we are lost.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.331
We need your help!

52:06.333 --> 52:10.337
Can you tell us how to
get to the sunken ship?

52:12.257 --> 52:15.258
Look, it's a beautiful square!

52:15.260 --> 52:17.846
(LIGHT MUSIC)

52:26.228 --> 52:28.311
LILY: Oh no,
they're swimming away!

52:28.313 --> 52:32.150
FIFI: Don't go,
sardines, we need your help!

52:32.152 --> 52:34.401
Maybe they did try to help us.

52:34.403 --> 52:36.820
They danced into a square.

52:36.822 --> 52:39.197
Why did they form a square?

52:39.199 --> 52:41.200
I think it was a clue!

52:41.202 --> 52:42.409
A clue?

52:42.411 --> 52:43.744
What did it mean?

52:43.746 --> 52:47.500
Well, windows are
square, tables are square,

52:48.501 --> 52:51.336
what else is square?

52:51.338 --> 52:53.173
Hmm, a box is a square.

52:54.548 --> 52:58.258
In my reef there lives
a yellow-spotted box fish.

52:58.260 --> 53:01.720
I have never seen a
yellow-spotted box fish.

53:01.722 --> 53:04.264
I don't think the
sardines were telling us

53:04.266 --> 53:07.184
to find a yellow-spotted fish,
Cherie.

53:07.186 --> 53:09.436
Why else would they
swim into a square shape?

53:09.438 --> 53:11.648
A square has four sides.

53:13.650 --> 53:14.858
Wait!

53:14.860 --> 53:18.445
Isn't there a place
called Sweetwater Square?

53:18.447 --> 53:19.488
Yes!

53:19.490 --> 53:21.157
Seawater Square is a
place where lots

53:21.159 --> 53:23.284
of sea animals meet!

53:23.286 --> 53:24.659
A meeting place?

53:24.661 --> 53:26.704
I think the sardines
were telling us

53:26.706 --> 53:30.041
to go to Sweetwater
Square to meet someone.

53:30.043 --> 53:31.333
Who?

53:31.335 --> 53:32.918
I don't know.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.380
LILY: How do we get to
Seawater Square?

53:35.382 --> 53:38.423
(LIGHT MUSIC)

53:38.425 --> 53:41.552
Look, maybe he can help us!

53:41.554 --> 53:42.681
Hi, I'm Fifi.

53:44.056 --> 53:47.474
I'm a pastel fish from
Fishtail Reef.

53:47.476 --> 53:49.851
I'm Lily, I'm a blue whale.

53:49.853 --> 53:52.729
I'm Cherie, I'm a stingray.

53:52.731 --> 53:55.148
I'm Jimmy, I'm a crab.

53:55.150 --> 53:56.066
(LAUGHS)

53:56.068 --> 53:57.901
Why are you lost?

53:57.903 --> 54:00.780
We were on a
field trip with our class.

54:00.782 --> 54:03.199
A sea monster chased us.

54:03.201 --> 54:05.784
We thought sea monsters ate
little fish.

54:05.786 --> 54:08.204
Then we met Timothy Magrue.

54:08.206 --> 54:10.208
He's a really big shark.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.458
He has a lot of teeth.

54:13.460 --> 54:16.045
Rows and rows of teeth!

54:16.047 --> 54:19.090
He had a really bad toothache.

54:19.092 --> 54:20.842
He taught us that
most sea monsters

54:20.844 --> 54:22.760
do not eat little fish.

54:22.762 --> 54:25.262
Sea monsters are friendly!

54:25.264 --> 54:27.347
How do you know I'm friendly?

54:27.349 --> 54:29.016
(LAUGHS)

54:29.018 --> 54:31.686
Yeah, I'm very friendly too.

54:31.688 --> 54:33.813
I like makin' new friends.

54:33.815 --> 54:36.773
We are trying to get
to Sweetwater Square.

54:36.775 --> 54:38.443
Do you know how to get there?

54:38.445 --> 54:41.528
Everybody knows how to
get to Sweetwater Square

54:41.530 --> 54:43.405
but you can't go there.

54:43.407 --> 54:44.865
Why not?

54:44.867 --> 54:46.076
I am a crab.

54:47.244 --> 54:50.412
I have legs,
I have lots of legs.

54:50.414 --> 54:52.623
You don't have any legs.

54:52.625 --> 54:56.918
Why do we need legs to
get to Sweetwater Square?

54:56.920 --> 54:59.421
The only way to get to
Sweetwater Square

54:59.423 --> 55:02.467
is to go through the cave
of the skeleton fish.

55:02.469 --> 55:05.510
I can crawl through the
sand, I can use my legs

55:05.512 --> 55:07.387
to bury myself in the sand.

55:07.389 --> 55:10.307
I can hide from the
skeleton fish.

55:10.309 --> 55:11.851
Why do you have to hide?

55:11.853 --> 55:13.936
What are skeleton fish?

55:13.938 --> 55:15.731
They are very scary.

55:16.565 --> 55:19.483
I'm not allowed to go to the
cave of the skeleton fish,

55:19.485 --> 55:21.610
fish ghosts live there.

55:21.612 --> 55:23.362
Fish ghosts?

55:23.364 --> 55:26.490
It is a very spooky place.

55:26.492 --> 55:29.494
Is that the only way to
get to Seawater Square?

55:29.496 --> 55:30.869
Yes!

55:30.871 --> 55:32.454
Then we have to go.

55:32.456 --> 55:35.624
We have to get Cherie
home to the sunken ship.

55:35.626 --> 55:37.959
We have to get back
to Fishtail Reef.

55:37.961 --> 55:40.713
I want to get Cherie back
to the sunken ship too.

55:40.715 --> 55:43.965
Then we're off to the
cave of the skeleton fish.

55:43.967 --> 55:47.010
You are very
brave sea animals.

55:47.012 --> 55:50.139
How do we get to the
cave of the skeleton fish?

55:50.141 --> 55:53.726
Keep swimming and you'll
see a big ol' cave openin'.

55:53.728 --> 55:57.231
Thanks Jimmy, you are
a very nice crab!

56:02.778 --> 56:04.153
Fish ghosts?

56:04.155 --> 56:08.532
Do you think there are really
fish ghosts inside the cave?

56:08.534 --> 56:10.242
I hope not!

56:10.244 --> 56:11.994
Sounds scary.

56:11.996 --> 56:13.996
Maybe we shouldn't go.

56:13.998 --> 56:16.039
Don't be afraid, Cherie.

56:16.041 --> 56:18.501
How come you aren't afraid,
Fifi?

56:18.503 --> 56:22.921
I had a really scary
dream that I was lost.

56:22.923 --> 56:24.342
I was so scared.

56:25.217 --> 56:29.262
In my dream I swam
into the open ocean

56:29.264 --> 56:31.555
and sharks chased me!

56:31.557 --> 56:34.141
Did you get away from the
sharks?

56:34.143 --> 56:35.811
It was a bad dream.

56:36.771 --> 56:39.354
I woke up before
the sharks could eat me

56:39.356 --> 56:41.942
but it was a really scary dream.

56:42.818 --> 56:46.028
I could not find my way
back to Fishtail Reef.

56:46.030 --> 56:48.322
I was so scared!

56:48.324 --> 56:52.034
Now you are lost and there
are lots of sharks around.

56:52.036 --> 56:53.494
Aren't you scared?

56:53.496 --> 56:56.664
I'm not scared like
I was in my dream.

56:56.666 --> 56:58.583
Why aren't you scared?

56:58.585 --> 57:02.463
In my dream I was alone,
here I am not alone.

57:04.673 --> 57:10.720
I have my two best friends
and I have an idea.

57:10.722 --> 57:12.304
Tell us your idea!

57:12.306 --> 57:14.724
We will swim like sardines.

57:14.726 --> 57:17.642
That is a very good idea,
Fifi.

57:17.644 --> 57:20.521
If we swim close together we
will be safe.

57:20.523 --> 57:22.773
One little fish is easy to eat

57:22.775 --> 57:25.193
but three fish together...

57:25.195 --> 57:26.735
Can not be beat!

57:26.737 --> 57:30.365
We will swim like a big
ball of sardine fish.

57:30.367 --> 57:32.742
♪ When we're together ♪

57:32.744 --> 57:34.619
Everything is better!

57:34.621 --> 57:36.662
Got to stick together.

57:36.664 --> 57:39.749
Swimming past ghosts in
skeleton cave.

57:39.751 --> 57:42.543
We will make those
fish behave.

57:42.545 --> 57:45.298
You are very smart and brave.

57:46.465 --> 57:48.425
I am lucky you found me.

57:49.594 --> 57:50.550
Ready?

57:50.552 --> 57:53.679
Stay close.

57:53.681 --> 57:55.682
I don't see anything.

57:55.684 --> 57:58.392
Maybe there are
no skeleton fish.

57:58.394 --> 57:59.726
Who goes there?

57:59.728 --> 58:02.563
Who disturbs our slumber?

58:02.565 --> 58:05.733
My name is Fifi, I'm a
pastel fish from Fishtail Reef.

58:05.735 --> 58:07.068
We are lost!

58:07.070 --> 58:08.903
The sardines told us to
get to Sweetwater Square.

58:08.905 --> 58:10.987
Jimmy Crab said we have
to swim through this cave

58:10.989 --> 58:12.572
to get to Sweetwater Square.

58:12.574 --> 58:14.534
Please don't eat us!

58:14.536 --> 58:16.661
Yes, please don't eat us.

58:16.663 --> 58:17.496
Why not?

58:18.831 --> 58:20.956
Little fish taste delicious!

58:20.958 --> 58:23.085
(LAUGHS)

58:25.963 --> 58:27.713
You cannot eat us!

58:27.715 --> 58:30.048
We have to get Cherie
home to the sunken ship

58:30.050 --> 58:31.842
to see her mama and papa.

58:31.844 --> 58:34.679
We have to get home to
Fishtail Reef.

58:34.681 --> 58:36.014
Very brave.

58:36.016 --> 58:37.764
(LAUGHS)

58:37.766 --> 58:39.434
We could eat you!

58:39.436 --> 58:42.603
We could open our big
mouths and in ya go!

58:42.605 --> 58:45.063
But you would just swim
back out again.

58:45.065 --> 58:47.441
Everything goes right
through us.

58:47.443 --> 58:48.818
(LAUGHS)

58:48.820 --> 58:50.737
So we can swim
through the cave?

58:50.739 --> 58:55.450
We didn't say that (LAUGHS)
we cannot let you pass.

58:55.452 --> 58:56.700
Why not?

58:56.702 --> 58:59.787
First,
you must answer a riddle!

58:59.789 --> 59:00.746
A riddle?

59:00.748 --> 59:02.081
A question.

59:02.083 --> 59:03.624
What question?

59:03.626 --> 59:07.045
What do sea monsters
like to eat?

59:07.047 --> 59:10.798
Toothy's sea monster
likes to eat barnacles and...

59:10.800 --> 59:11.634
Wrong!

59:12.510 --> 59:14.469
(GURGLING)

59:14.471 --> 59:18.222
(SKELETON FISH SCREAMING)

59:18.224 --> 59:22.394
Sea monsters like to eat
what I do: skeleton fish.

59:23.438 --> 59:25.063
Toothy Magrue!

59:25.065 --> 59:27.481
My little fish baits.

59:27.483 --> 59:29.025
How are you feeling?

59:29.027 --> 59:30.028
Fantastic!

59:31.237 --> 59:34.655
Glurp ate the fish bone
stuck between my teeth

59:34.657 --> 59:39.827
and no more toothache!

59:39.829 --> 59:42.123
(GURGLING)

59:47.836 --> 59:48.672
ALL: Yay!

59:49.922 --> 59:53.133
You helped me so
I'm gonna help you.

59:54.427 --> 59:57.762
The sardines said we need
to go to Sweetwater Square.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.137
Really?

59:59.139 --> 01:00:02.934
Sweetwater Square is right
through there.

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:05.853
♪ Now I must go, I'm hungry so ♪

01:00:05.855 --> 01:00:08.690
♪ But our friend Glurp
will swim with you ♪

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:11.900
♪ His home is in the
sunken ship too ♪♪

01:00:11.902 --> 01:00:14.153
We will miss you,
Toothy Magrue.

01:00:14.155 --> 01:00:19.075
You're not a mean old shark,
you're our toothy fish pal.

01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:21.871
I will miss you too,
fish baits.

01:00:26.918 --> 01:00:29.293
There are so many sea animals,

01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:32.005
how do we know who we
are supposed to meet?

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:35.883
Maybe everyone knows how
to get to the sunken ship?

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:39.637
No one knows how to get
back to the sunken ship.

01:00:39.639 --> 01:00:45.142
Little stingray, I've been
lookin' all over for you.

01:00:45.144 --> 01:00:46.351
You have?

01:00:46.353 --> 01:00:49.938
I had to swim to the
surface for a breath of air.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.153
I got some air, swam back to
help you, but you were gone.

01:00:55.572 --> 01:00:58.322
Can you help us get
back to the sunken ship?

01:00:58.324 --> 01:01:00.657
Is that where you wanna go?

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:04.871
The sardines told me
you were lookin' for me.

01:01:04.873 --> 01:01:08.458
The sardines told us to
meet you in Sweetwater Square.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.628
Those sardines know
I always hang out here.

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:16.885
My name is Gramps, I'm an old
brown seal.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.675
I'm Fifi.

01:01:18.677 --> 01:01:21.262
This is Lily and Cherie.

01:01:21.264 --> 01:01:25.099
And this is Glurp, he
is a pet sea monster.

01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:27.311
Nice to meet all of you.

01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:31.773
You must be on
quite an adventure.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.191
Glurp chased us.

01:01:33.193 --> 01:01:35.901
We didn't know he was friendly.

01:01:35.903 --> 01:01:37.945
We made friends with a shark.

01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:40.197
It's been very exciting.

01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:44.411
Tell me all about it as
we swim to the sunken ship.

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:50.958
Everyone stay close together.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.878
I don't want to lose anymore
students.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.338
STUDENTS: Yes,
Professor Shark.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.840
Where are we going,
Inspector Petal?

01:01:58.842 --> 01:02:01.802
We are going to find
Slurp's cousin, Glurp,

01:02:01.804 --> 01:02:05.555
he chased Fifi and Lily
into the open ocean.

01:02:05.557 --> 01:02:08.767
Dudley Dolphin said
sea monsters eat fish.

01:02:08.769 --> 01:02:11.354
Dudley Dolphin was
just being silly.

01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:12.813
Sea monsters are friendly.

01:02:12.815 --> 01:02:15.066
They make very nice fish pets.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:18.820
Then why was Glurp
chasing Fifi and Lily?

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.655
We're going to find out.

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:24.784
Don't worry, Chopper, I
have a sword for a nose.

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:27.452
And I have very sharp teeth.

01:02:27.454 --> 01:02:30.414
And our teacher is a
tooth monster.

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:36.713
Yeah, we're not afraid of
sea monsters!

01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.965
Is the sunken ship
much further?

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:40.175
Not too far!

01:02:42.887 --> 01:02:44.720
I'm getting tired.

01:02:44.722 --> 01:02:45.972
(COUGHS)

01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:47.597
Hold on, dear.

01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:51.644
I need to swim to the
surface for some air.

01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:54.731
Don't go anywhere,
I'll be right back!

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:58.653
Uh oh, those sharks
don't look very friendly.

01:02:59.903 --> 01:03:02.030
What should we do, Fifi?

01:03:02.032 --> 01:03:03.990
Stay close together.

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:06.617
CHERIE: Maybe one of
them has a toothache.

01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:08.036
I don't think so!

01:03:08.038 --> 01:03:10.829
They all look very hungry to me.

01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:14.166
Everybody, look those
sharks right in the eye

01:03:14.168 --> 01:03:17.254
and yell goonches as
loud as you can.

01:03:18.297 --> 01:03:19.882
- Goonches!
- Goonches!

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.052
- Goonches!
- Goonches!

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:26.970
Look, Fifi, the sharks
are swimming away.

01:03:26.972 --> 01:03:27.972
Papa was right.

01:03:27.974 --> 01:03:30.974
He told me if I want
to scare a shark away,

01:03:30.976 --> 01:03:34.019
I just have to yell goonches.

01:03:34.021 --> 01:03:37.815
Toothy Magrue said goonches
are big, mean sea monsters

01:03:37.817 --> 01:03:38.985
that eat sharks.

01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:42.070
Fifi saved the day!

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:42.905
ALL: Yay!

01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:48.117
Alba, is that you?

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:49.577
Gramps!

01:03:49.579 --> 01:03:53.164
I'm so happy
you found each other.

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:56.958
Happy to be
part of your adventure.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.586
I'll see ya later.

01:03:58.588 --> 01:04:01.255
I knew you would find
them, Inspector Petal.

01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:04.758
We found Cherie and Fifi and
Lily too!

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.010
Yay.

01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:08.554
Fish play, my dear Kiki.

01:04:08.556 --> 01:04:09.391
Fish play.

01:04:12.768 --> 01:04:14.434
Oh, Cherie!

01:04:14.436 --> 01:04:15.728
We just saw Gramps.

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:18.271
He told us you were rescued.

01:04:18.273 --> 01:04:21.193
Mama, I have so much
to tell you.

01:04:22.027 --> 01:04:24.238

01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:27.865

01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:29.325
Stay away from us.

01:04:29.327 --> 01:04:30.952
His name is Glurp, Sammy.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.369
He's really nice.

01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:35.123
Keep away from my sister.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:38.376
He is yellow like me.

01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:41.295
Squiggly wiggly, a
sea monster with one eye

01:04:41.297 --> 01:04:42.921
bigger than the other?

01:04:42.923 --> 01:04:45.133
How do you know
which one to look at?

I am so glad I met you.

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:03.150
I hope to visit you in
Fishtail Reef very soon.

01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:05.028
Best friends forever?

And ever and ever and ever.

01:05:10.909 --> 01:05:13.577
Time for us to head
back to Fishtail Reef.

Aren't you going home
with Cherie

01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:17.749

I think you have a new
pet sea monster, Fifi.

01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:27.550
Wanna come home with me,
Glurp?
