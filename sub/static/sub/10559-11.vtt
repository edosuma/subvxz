01:33.160 --> 01:34.991
And thank you
for the information, Mr Lane.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.354
What have you, George?

01:36.440 --> 01:38.908
Sir, the girl's name was Amy Goldham.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.228
Just a young thing, sir.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.914
Apparently, she snuck out
after curfew last night,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.150
although there were no witnesses
and no one knows why,

01:45.240 --> 01:46.275
or so they say.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.475
Who discovered the body?

01:47.560 --> 01:49.790
Um, Samuel Lane, the headmaster.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.997
He pulled Miss Goldham from
this pool at eight o'clock this morning.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.274
Thank you, George.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.350
Her lungs were full of water.
She drowned.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.600
But not before suffering
numerous cuts and scrapes.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.629
Perhaps running through the woods,

02:03.720 --> 02:04.948
away from someone.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.750
Death occurred approximately
eight hours ago, judging by lividity.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.595
None of these cuts
appear life-threatening.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.550
Then how did she end up in the pond?

02:14.920 --> 02:17.070
Well, there is this.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.031
A boot mark, perhaps?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.509
Mmm.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.597
So Amy Goldham was held down
with intent.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.715
Murder, then?

02:30.200 --> 02:32.634
We've asked the teachers
to stay at home today.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.519
Not much appetite for studies,
given the events.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.835
No, I suspect not.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.035
Poor Amy. Sweet girl.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.680
Attentive in class,
considerate of her classmates.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.030
Quite innocent, so I supposed.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.275
You supposed?

02:47.360 --> 02:49.510
Well, what am I to think when a girl
slips out in the dead of night

02:49.600 --> 02:50.669
wearing next to nothing?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.678
How did you come to discover her body
this morning, Mr Lane?

02:54.760 --> 02:56.557
I live in the coach house
on the back of the property.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.029
I walk the grounds each morning
to see that all is well.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.393
She was cold as stone.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.235
When I pulled her from the water,
I knew I was too late.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.672
Have her parents been notified?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.834
The Goldhams are travelling in Europe
this time of year.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.037
Most of the parents of our girls
spend the bulk of their year abroad.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.872
We have the Goldhams' itinerary.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.552
I'll be needing that. Thank you.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.234
Can you think of a reason
why a young girl like Amy

03:19.320 --> 03:20.514
would steal away like this?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.874
A boyfriend, perhaps?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.234
Oh, I doubt if it's anything like that.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.551
The owner of our school, Mrs Irvin,
she rather frowns on that sort of thing.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.909
I see.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.389
A boyfriend? Absolutely not.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.835
I lock the doors at 9:00 p.m.
and do a roll call.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.876
Bedtime is 9:30, lights out at 10:00.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.715
So, after you retire for the night,
the girls are unsupervised.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.234
I sleep with one ear open, Detective.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.959
What do I tell the parents who expect
their daughters to be safe at my school?

03:49.080 --> 03:51.116
How do I tell them
that a girl has been murdered?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.589
Were you aware
Amy had slipped out, Miss Dennett?

03:56.160 --> 03:58.355
I didn't get to see Amy at all
last night after dinner.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.237
I was in the infirmary with a cold.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.510
You just wanted a room to yourself.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.874
That's untrue, Laura.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.555
Ladies.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.194
Amy was here
in the dormitory last night.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.713
We all said goodnight and went to sleep.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.273
Shh! Olivia.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.753
Friends share secrets, do they not?

04:19.320 --> 04:21.834
I'm not here to get
any of you in trouble with the school,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.593
I simply need to know
if Amy had a secret.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.956
We don't know why Amy ran off,
Detective.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.632
But I think it must have been
near midnight.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.835
Oh?

04:30.920 --> 04:34.515
The clock struck twelve
and then I heard the third stair squeak.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.917
Mrs Irvin won't fix it so she knows
if anyone tries sneaking out.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.315
I see.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.990
And does this happen often,
this sneaking out?

04:43.760 --> 04:44.829
Have any of you...

04:44.920 --> 04:46.558
- No, never.
- Never.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.475
I see.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.358
Well, thank you very much, ladies.
You're free to go.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.749
George,

05:11.160 --> 05:12.559
help me with this bed.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.309
Mmm.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.674
The secret lives of teenage girls.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.559
Detective Murdoch!

05:33.360 --> 05:34.998
Miss Dennett.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.670
Amy always waited
until she thought we were asleep,

05:38.760 --> 05:41.399
and then she'd get those out
and she'd read by candlelight.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.596
I saw her writing, too, sometimes.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.829
I think she was in love
with an older boy.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.958
And these letters are from him?

05:50.360 --> 05:54.353
I saw her talking to a boy outside
the downtown library once, Detective.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.192
And then the letters started coming.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.517
Did you get a clear look at this boy?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.028
No, I'm sorry.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.435
Well, thank you for your help,
Miss Dennett.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.755
Arlene.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.989
Arlene.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.198
Please catch who did this.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.109
Amy used to be my closest friend.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.393
We'll do our best.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.358
In the meantime, if you think
of anything else, please contact me.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.229
Hard to keep your lunch down,

06:29.320 --> 06:30.548
reading tripe like this.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.029
What about this one?

06:33.120 --> 06:35.270
"I feel your warmth
flow through me,

06:35.360 --> 06:37.430
"like blush to my cold, blue lips. "

06:37.560 --> 06:38.675
Pretty awful.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.228
"Like rain to a desert,
you bring me back to life.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.237
"You are my breath itself. "

06:43.400 --> 06:45.868
That one's not half bad, actually.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.998
Signed "V", I assume?

06:48.160 --> 06:50.879
Just like the others.
Each one steamier than the last.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.992
Did you ever write poetry
to your sweetheart as a boy, Murdoch?

06:56.080 --> 06:58.196
Oh, sir, I'm not much of a poet.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.749
Though I do remember being quite proud
of a rhyming couplet I wrote

07:02.840 --> 07:04.512
in praise of the family dog.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.872
It was a very well-behaved dog.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.470
Her last diary entry,
dated two days ago.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.114
"I know who 'V' is.
Should I tell him I know?"

07:18.320 --> 07:19.958
He tried to keep his identity from her?

07:20.600 --> 07:21.669
A married man?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.595
So,

07:23.680 --> 07:25.910
she finds out somehow, tells him.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.835
It doesn't go over well.
Facedown into the pond she goes.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.990
No question she drowned.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.358
But she also had alcohol in her system,

07:37.440 --> 07:39.590
and another substance
I believe to be an opiate.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.718
Was she interfered with?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.279
No, she's intact.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.796
But, there's one other thing.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.435
Amy was missing
almost three pints of blood.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.559
Three pints?

07:51.800 --> 07:54.268
But her cuts and scratches
could hardly account for that.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.829
It appears she was bled.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.555
There are two puncture marks
on her neck.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.435
They extend into the jugular vein.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.910
One mark is slightly bigger
than the other.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.714
According to her writings,

08:09.800 --> 08:12.633
Amy would frequently leave the dormitory
late at night

08:12.720 --> 08:14.756
to rendezvous with a man.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.678
The other girls had to have noticed.
They must know something.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.598
I'm sure they do.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.955
A teenage girl doesn't enter
into a secret romance

08:22.040 --> 08:24.429
without making sure her friends
know all about it.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.748
But why would someone bleed her?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.669
It's a vampire! Without a doubt!

08:32.760 --> 08:34.034
What the bloody hell is a vampire?

08:34.120 --> 08:35.155
Oh, it's a vile creature, sir.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.596
A human corpse that rises from its grave
after the sun goes down

08:38.679 --> 08:42.467
and, to sustain its undead existence,
it drinks the blood of the living.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.872
He's beginning to worry me.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.270
<i>Sir, a new novel called Dracula
has been causing quite a stir.</i>

08:49.480 --> 08:51.596
It's based, of course, on a vampire.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.113
It's a terrifying tale, sir. Chilling.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.474
It's not unlike my own murder mystery.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.630
Although, I must say,
I find Bram Stoker's prose

08:56.720 --> 08:57.789
to be rather longwinded.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.995
Bram Stoker?

08:59.120 --> 09:01.475
Bram Stoker, the manager
of the Lyceum Theatre in London?

09:01.560 --> 09:04.199
- That's the one.
- So, a bloke who spends most of his time

09:04.280 --> 09:06.236
ironing actors' trousers writes a book,

09:06.320 --> 09:08.595
and therefore Amy Goldham
was killed by a vampire?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.989
Sir, why else would that poor girl
be down three pints of blood

09:11.080 --> 09:12.911
with bite marks in her neck?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.956
George, I didn't say she had bite marks,

09:15.040 --> 09:16.268
I said that she had been bled.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.158
But, sirs, vampires have
a mysterious power over women.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.708
In the novel,
young girls flock to Dracula.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.678
They offer themselves up
in a wild, erotic frenzy.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.149
And he, with his razor-sharp fangs,

09:27.240 --> 09:29.435
he bites their neck
and drinks their blood.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.359
It's true!

09:31.520 --> 09:34.592
Werewolves. Martians. Ghosts.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.999
Now, vampires.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.960
What next, Crabtree? Abominable snowmen?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.031
Sir, that is a fictitious creature.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.039
Dreamed up, probably,
by somebody who has seen a Sasquatch.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.713
- Now, my Aunt Dowling...
- William.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.512
Looks like a schoolgirl.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.715
Get out.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.358
I overheard two girls

09:55.440 --> 09:58.910
talking about the mysterious boy
Amy was meeting up with.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.790
He was seeing someone else as well,
apparently.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.990
Oh? Who was that?

10:06.240 --> 10:07.309
If I tell,

10:08.080 --> 10:10.878
promise me you won't say anything
to Mrs Irvin or Mr Lane.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.237
I was sworn to secrecy.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.829
Of course.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.594
Well, I consider a vow to be sacred.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.557
Don't you, Detective Murdoch?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.398
Sacred as, say,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.389
a vow of fidelity between lovers.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.829
Of course.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.199
It's Laura MacFarlane.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.589
She's been sneaking out
to meet this man, too.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.236
Arlene told you, didn't she?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.349
Well, she's a liar.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.630
Miss MacFarlane,
the man you are trying to protect

10:46.880 --> 10:48.279
killed your friend Amy.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.429
I don't know why,

10:49.520 --> 10:51.556
but I fear he may do the same to you.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.115
He wouldn't. He's a romantic.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.518
Arlene is just jealous.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.630
She wants to meet him too,
but he doesn't want her.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.109
Miss MacFarlane,

11:05.200 --> 11:06.838
would you please open your shirt collar?

11:08.880 --> 11:09.949
Please?

11:26.320 --> 11:27.719
I'm not the only one.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.432
You mean, besides Amy Goldham?

11:33.280 --> 11:34.793
A young girl is dead.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.315
Who else here has been visiting
this man?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.869
Olivia.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.719
Olivia Cornell.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.715
I see.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.234
Can you describe him?

11:49.920 --> 11:50.989
I'll try.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.953
He's beautiful.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.236
But, I always remember him
as if from a dream.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.036
I was hoping for a somewhat
less poetic description.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.999
Is he short? Tall? Does he have
any distinguishing features?

12:07.400 --> 12:08.469
Yes.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.397
When he comes for me,

12:12.320 --> 12:13.799
he seems to glide on the air.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.113
I should run.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.792
I know I'm in danger,

12:18.320 --> 12:22.313
but I want him. He makes me want him.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.355
Where do you meet?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.799
In the cemetery,

12:26.280 --> 12:28.350
near the school, inside a mausoleum.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.312
Are these encounters arranged?

12:30.560 --> 12:31.879
He sends us letters.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.035
Little notes.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.915
We always meet at night.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.429
And what happens?

12:37.960 --> 12:39.791
He takes me in his arms

12:40.200 --> 12:43.078
and I feel his sweet breath
and lips against my neck.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.677
It's like a kiss.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.589
But more.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.399
I feel his teeth pressing into my neck.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.475
It stings.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.955
I lose all my strength.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.037
He sweeps me into his arms,

12:59.120 --> 13:00.473
and the next thing I know...

13:00.640 --> 13:03.598
...I wake up on a bed of rose petals
in the mausoleum.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.353
We are his chosen ones,

13:05.920 --> 13:07.433
Amy, Olivia and I.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.319
But not Arlene?

13:09.880 --> 13:10.949
No.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.756
Arlene said she did meet him,
but she was lying.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.797
It was... pitiful.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.038
Arlene couldn't understand.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.797
He's chosen us for our beauty.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.753
And our blood.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.115
Your blood?

13:29.720 --> 13:30.994
Well, yes.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.349
Isn't it obvious?

13:38.720 --> 13:39.789
He's a vampire.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.713
So these girls are hysterical, then?

13:44.120 --> 13:45.599
Avid readers, in any case.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.953
Clearly, they've been influenced
by Bram Stoker's novel.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.158
But there is no vampire, right?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.195
Not as such.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.189
I believe this man is playing
into the vampire myth

13:57.280 --> 13:58.872
to take advantage of the girls.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.351
But Dr Ogden said
that Amy Goldham wasn't violated.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.837
At any rate,
Laura MacFarlane and Olivia Cornell

14:05.920 --> 14:07.035
are with Dr Ogden now.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.874
She will examine them to be sure that
they haven't been physically harmed.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.828
Other than being tapped for a few
pints of the old red stuff, you mean?

14:14.040 --> 14:15.871
Yes, sir. Other than that.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.229
Good day, gents.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.029
Ah! Look who's here, Murdoch.
Paddy Glynn. Fancy that.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.350
Care to comment
on the rash of vampire attacks

14:24.440 --> 14:25.953
at the Tepes School for Girls,
gentlemen?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.759
Mr Glynn, we are not investigating
vampire attacks.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.150
Teenage girls do talk, Detective,
and this one's a zing-dinger of a story.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.435
If you publish garbage like that, Glynn,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.750
you know the type
of hysteria it will cause.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.875
Or don't you care about that?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.076
As always, Inspector, you are right.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.037
The fourth estate
mustn't rouse the rabble,

14:42.120 --> 14:44.315
but thank you for confirming the story.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.877
We didn't confirm a thing, Glynn.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.758
And there are no bloody vampires.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.679
- Hello, Julia.
- William!

15:01.120 --> 15:02.917
Don't do that.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.953
<i>Well, it seems
everyone is reading Dracula but me.</i>

15:06.040 --> 15:09.828
Yes, well,
it is a most compelling story.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.955
Indeed.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.873
Laura and Olivia were most anxious
that I read it.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.519
Well, I've examined the girls

15:16.600 --> 15:18.750
and they appeared to have been
spared any interference.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.077
So, sexual assault wasn't the motive.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.434
I'd say not.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.835
What could possibly be motivating
this man of theirs?

15:28.200 --> 15:32.318
And, though the girls have all shed
their tears over Amy Goldham's death,

15:32.480 --> 15:34.994
why do they continue to revel
in the fact

15:35.080 --> 15:37.958
that they have been chosen
by this vampire?

15:39.080 --> 15:43.232
A vampire represents
something savage and forbidden.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.430
He demands their complete surrender

15:46.520 --> 15:48.511
and the life-force in their warm blood.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.638
It's all fantasy, of course.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.310
Julia, these encounters are all violent.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.108
Do all women share this fantasy?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.755
You're missing the point, William.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.069
Some women

16:03.800 --> 16:06.872
long for uninhibited romance.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.149
I've heard it said.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.153
This must be the one here, sir.
It's just as the girls described.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.593
Indeed, George.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.195
<i>I almost wish
I hadn't read that Dracula, now.</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:24.590
It all just seems
a bit too real at the moment.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.033
Away you go, George.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.919
Rose petals.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.558
Just like the girls said.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.513
No obvious signs of blood.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.197
Well, sir, perhaps the vampire
met the girls here,

17:02.280 --> 17:03.838
but bled them elsewhere.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.674
Miss Dennett.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.190
I just wanted to see
where the vampire lives.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.551
I thought if I'd met him,
I could ask him why he never chose me.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.311
The rose petals are so beautiful.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.436
Miss Dennett.
This is a potential crime scene.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.750
Please, call me Arlene.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.749
Arlene, the constable

17:36.280 --> 17:37.838
will escort you
back to your school, now.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.955
Him?

17:39.920 --> 17:40.989
Him.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.319
Miss Dennett, after you.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.475
Murdoch, look at this.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.634
Glynn's got the whole city
in a frenzy about vampires.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.714
The telephone lines
in every station house are jammed up.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.592
And I hear there's been a run on garlic.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.117
Why is everyone suddenly buying garlic?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.235
I...

18:06.320 --> 18:08.151
It's been a while, Murdoch,
but Paddy Glynn is looking good

18:08.240 --> 18:10.037
for the old Black Glove right about now.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.998
Sirs, that was Mrs Irvin on the phone.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.593
One of her student's is missing.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.195
Her name is Dorothy Cornell,
Olivia's younger sister.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.272
I did the second bed-check
at 11:00 p.m., and Dorothy was gone.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.315
That's her!

18:23.440 --> 18:25.510
Dorothy! Dorothy.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.677
Dorothy, what...

18:28.440 --> 18:29.873
George!

18:29.960 --> 18:31.188
Wake up Dr Ogden.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.315
- Sir.
- There's a telephone

18:32.400 --> 18:33.958
on the dormitory floor.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.109
All signs suggest that she was bled.

18:46.800 --> 18:47.835
Dorothy,

18:48.240 --> 18:50.071
why did you go see the vampire?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.311
I found a note in one of my schoolbooks.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.595
He asked me to meet him
at the mausoleum.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.429
What happened then?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.480
Well, the other girls said
it was so romantic,

19:01.760 --> 19:03.716
but on my way to the mausoleum,

19:03.800 --> 19:05.438
somebody grabbed me.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.789
And it hurt.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.835
Was it a man?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.878
- Yes.
- Did you see his face?

19:11.640 --> 19:12.755
No.

19:12.960 --> 19:17.636
A cloth was placed over my face
and I must have fainted.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.037
I think someone was carrying me.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.999
It was horrible.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.714
You're safe now.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.109
This attack breaks the pattern.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.671
Indeed. There's nothing romantic
about being accosted and chloroformed.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.592
No. He's dispensed
with all the vampire dramatics,

19:43.840 --> 19:45.990
almost as if he was in a hurry.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.919
In a hurry for blood.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.073
What can that mean?

20:09.400 --> 20:13.234
Detective.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.909
I'm very sorry, Detective.
I didn't know who else to go to.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.911
That's quite all right, Arlene.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.311
Why don't you tell me what happened?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.913
It was him, the vampire.
He sent me a note.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.959
It said...

20:52.400 --> 20:54.152
To meet him at the crypt.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.274
"Dearest Arlene,
The time has come for us to meet.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.033
"Tonight, at the mausoleum,
I'll be waiting. V."

21:02.120 --> 21:04.554
He said that he chose me
because I was pretty.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.754
He pulled me towards him
and then I just felt his fangs

21:07.840 --> 21:09.512
piercing my neck.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.790
And then, I think I fainted.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.558
I'm cold, Detective.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.509
Could you... Could you hold me, please?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.550
Your timing is impeccable,
as usual, Doctor.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.676
I asked the Doctor to come
while you were resting.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.829
Doctor?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.673
I don't need a doctor,
I just need to stay here for a while.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.796
Let me take your blood pressure.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.869
Doctor,

21:44.640 --> 21:47.996
these puncture marks on her neck
look different than the ones on Amy's,

21:48.080 --> 21:49.149
don't you think?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.995
Yes. They're not very deep at all.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.039
Perhaps the vampire changed his mind?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.111
No. He bit me.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.275
Arlene?

22:10.720 --> 22:13.393
Is it possible you pierced your own neck

22:13.480 --> 22:15.072
with this hairpin

22:16.280 --> 22:17.793
and there was no vampire?

22:19.240 --> 22:21.629
Her pressure's normal.
She's not been bled.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.518
I just wanted to see you.

22:29.520 --> 22:33.479
But you only seem to care
about the girls who get attacked.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.076
I feel like I'm left out.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.032
Like I'm not even important any more.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.711
I think I'll take my leave.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.835
No.

22:47.840 --> 22:52.994
That is, Doctor, perhaps you could
escort Arlene back to the school

22:53.200 --> 22:54.519
on your way home?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.072
I feel like such a fool.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.992
I wouldn't worry.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.038
Detective Murdoch will soon forget
all about it.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.759
He must have many women
falling into his arms,

23:33.840 --> 23:35.956
so why would he pay any mind to me?

23:37.200 --> 23:40.670
I sometimes wonder
if I will ever find true love.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.038
Have you found yours?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.991
Yes, I have.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.436
Ah, Murdoch. Between the lunatics
who thought they saw vampires

24:02.520 --> 24:04.795
and the other lunatics
who think they are vampires,

24:04.880 --> 24:07.872
the whole constabulary was out
all last night working across the city.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.394
Were there any reports
of actual vampire attacks?

24:10.640 --> 24:11.993
Actual vampire attacks?

24:12.360 --> 24:13.839
Vampire attacks, you say?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.672
Can you give me
an approximate number, Inspector?

24:17.120 --> 24:20.271
I should stake you down, Glynn,
before you can stir up any more panic.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.708
Detective,
are we any closer

24:21.800 --> 24:23.631
to apprehending this undead menace?

24:24.440 --> 24:25.839
Why, yes, Mr Glynn.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.832
In fact, he's safely in custody,
in our jail cells,

24:28.920 --> 24:30.194
resting for the day.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.673
Didn't know he had a sense of humour.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.318
I'll tell you something else
you don't know.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.277
How close you are to meeting my fist.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.559
Jocularity. That's...

24:42.880 --> 24:44.359
Perhaps not.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.275
Sir, something interesting
from Station Five's case files.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.793
There was an attempted sexual assault

24:55.880 --> 24:57.791
at the Tepes School for Girls
three years ago.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.836
A young lady by the name of Gail Baxter.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.478
And they put a name to the suspect.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.629
Who was that?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.036
A young chap
by the name of Daniel Irvin,

25:06.160 --> 25:07.388
Mrs Irvin's son.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.675
I wasn't aware that she had a son.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.150
Apparently, Miss Baxter was chloroformed
and awoke in a carriage with Daniel.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.592
And where is she now?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.238
She moved to England with her family.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.916
Daniel Irvin was never charged.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.353
I wonder why.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.792
He killed himself.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.635
The scandal proved too much for him.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.156
He was such a sensitive soul.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.797
I found Daniel hanging in his room,

25:34.880 --> 25:37.952
the day that the police
were to bring charges.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.359
He was innocent.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.755
Until the most recent attacks
on the girls,

25:52.840 --> 25:56.150
the pattern of abduction
did not involve the use of chloroform.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.754
But last night's attack
on Dorothy Cornell did.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.957
Like the one at the school
three years ago.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.670
Well, the suspect, Daniel Irvin
is dead and buried.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.830
Yes, sir, I saw the death certificate.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.594
So what's the connection?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.437
Sirs, I believe I have solved the crime.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.279
The Tepes Family left
the vampire-infested hills of Moldavia

26:18.360 --> 26:21.557
in 1850 and moved to Canada.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.270
In 1858,
they open the Tepes School for Girls.

26:25.440 --> 26:29.319
Now, it is my belief that members of
the Tepes Family are, in fact, vampires.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.909
They have to move frequently
to avoid arousing suspicion

26:32.000 --> 26:33.035
and they changed their name.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.350
So that's why the Tepes family
called their school

26:35.440 --> 26:37.271
The Tepes School for Girls?

26:37.560 --> 26:39.232
- Right. Makes sense.
- Mmm.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.836
Well, perhaps I don't have
all the details worked out entirely,

26:41.920 --> 26:44.275
but the genius of it all
is that the school provides them

26:44.360 --> 26:46.874
with an abundant source
of fresh, young blood.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.117
George, have you any evidence of this?

26:49.200 --> 26:52.476
Yes, sirs. Because the vampire attacks
have not just happed this week

26:52.560 --> 26:53.595
and three years ago,

26:53.680 --> 26:57.798
but also nearly forty years ago, 1859.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.839
Various girls from the Tepes School
were abducted and then released.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.832
Now, at the time, Alexander Tepes
was suspected of the attacks.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.992
But, like his grandson Daniel,
conveniently died

27:07.080 --> 27:08.399
before changes could ever be laid.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.833
Note the similarities
between these two men.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.430
Here, a sketch of Daniel,
and this man, supposedly,

27:15.520 --> 27:16.839
is Alexander Tepes.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.592
What do you mean, "supposedly"?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.752
It is my belief, sir, that these two
are, in fact, one and the same.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.313
So, he's lived for 80 years
and hasn't aged?

27:25.400 --> 27:28.233
Not 80, sir. Hundreds.

27:29.720 --> 27:33.633
I believe that Daniel, Alexander,
take your pick,

27:33.720 --> 27:36.678
both are, in fact, this man,

27:37.200 --> 27:38.349
Vlad the Impaler.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.154
Real name, Vlad Drakulya,

27:41.240 --> 27:42.719
noted vampire.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.950
Again, notice the facial similarities.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.875
And, sirs,
Tepes is Romanian for "impaler".

27:50.640 --> 27:52.392
Just wrap it up, will you, Crabtree?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.798
Sir.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.269
Alexander Tepes
hasn't been heard of in 40 years.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.512
I can provide two witnesses
who will identify him as their attacker.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.309
That's him.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.269
That's him.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.029
There is a way to prove my theory.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.951
There are still several hours
of daylight left.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.555
If I'm correct, if Alexander Tepes
and Daniel Irvin are, in fact,

28:19.640 --> 28:21.756
one and the same immortal creature,

28:21.840 --> 28:23.717
then one of their coffins will be empty

28:24.040 --> 28:26.076
and the other will contain
a sleeping vampire.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.594
We're not digging up graves.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.749
We won't have to, sir.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.990
The coffins are in the Tepes family
mausoleum. We've been there.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.757
I don't, for one minute,
believe we're dealing with a vampire,

28:36.840 --> 28:38.990
but something is wrong here.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.792
Well, George,
it seems Alexander Tepes is at rest.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.553
Well, sir, that can be anybody.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.790
Probably one of his victims.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.839
Sweet mother of...

29:02.000 --> 29:04.753
Sir, it's an animal. Is that a dog?

29:05.120 --> 29:09.318
Yes, George, and it's definitely
not the remains of Daniel Irvin.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.789
I can't explain it.
I don't know what happened.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.309
Your son is alive, isn't he, Mrs Irvin?

29:19.040 --> 29:20.393
I was there.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.956
I held his lifeless body in my arms.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.198
Who else saw the body?

29:28.160 --> 29:30.355
My husband, God rest his soul.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.911
A doctor arrived, pronounced Daniel dead
and then the police came.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.639
There's no more to say.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.317
Was it an open-casket funeral?

29:42.760 --> 29:43.988
It was not.

29:45.520 --> 29:50.150
Detective, someone desecrated
my son's grave.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.636
How is his soul to be in peace?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.872
Could she be telling the truth?

29:57.400 --> 29:58.674
I don't believe she is, sir.

29:58.760 --> 30:02.673
I believe Mrs Irvin helped Daniel
stage his death to avoid prison.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.673
But why did all the girls identify
the portrait of Alexander Tepes

30:05.760 --> 30:07.034
as their attacker?

30:07.640 --> 30:08.834
Family resemblance.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.195
Fine.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.871
How did the boy
manage to stage his own death?

30:12.960 --> 30:14.109
Wasn't there a post-mortem?

30:14.400 --> 30:17.198
If the cause of death was obvious
to the attending physician...

30:17.280 --> 30:18.508
No post-mortem required then.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.318
And if the doctor signed
the death certificate,

30:20.400 --> 30:23.039
the police would have taken that
as proof that Daniel was dead.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.031
Bloody lazy police work, if you ask me.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.599
Who signed the death certificate?

30:26.800 --> 30:30.270
A Dr Lucas Harwick.
I have George looking for him, now.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.674
It's proving difficult, sir.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.593
He was suspended from the Ontario
College of Physicians and Surgeons

30:34.680 --> 30:36.113
in 1894.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.191
No one seems to know
what he's done with himself since then.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.474
Why was he suspended?

30:39.560 --> 30:40.675
Some sort of malpractice.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.557
Unfortunately, the records
are not very detailed.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.755
Of course not.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.149
Doctors always protect each other,
we know that.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.352
In any case, there's no record
of Lucas Harwick in city records.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.555
Could be he's moved on.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.877
Doctor Harwick? The name
isn't familiar. What's your interest?

30:56.480 --> 30:59.119
I have reason to believe
he's falsified a death certificate

30:59.200 --> 31:00.633
relating to this case.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.636
You mean to say that someone involved
in the Tepes School case may be undead,

31:04.720 --> 31:05.789
so to speak.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.155
Yes, very good.

31:08.480 --> 31:12.632
Well, I'd be happy to ask around
after this Harwick fellow.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.799
Thank you, Doctor.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.438
It's no trouble at all, William.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.189
I...

31:26.080 --> 31:27.149
Thank you.

31:40.560 --> 31:44.348
Dr Garland. Er, Darcy. How are you?

31:44.440 --> 31:47.477
Julia told me last night you're looking
for a Dr Lucas Harwick.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.149
Yes. Yes, I am. Please, come in.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.559
We used to work together.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.875
I see.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.951
This was at Buffalo General Hospital.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.156
He was a visiting physician at the time,

32:02.360 --> 32:05.397
researching the immunological
reaction in blood serum,

32:05.680 --> 32:07.113
but he had larger ideas.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.269
Such as?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.316
Harwick thought he had
identified the flaws

32:10.400 --> 32:12.152
of the blood transfusion treatment.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.958
Turns out he was wrong.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.675
Oh? What happened?

32:16.280 --> 32:19.590
He transfused blood from Subject A
to Subject B

32:19.680 --> 32:21.318
and there was no immune response.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.313
But when he transfused from B to A,
Subject A died.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.188
Their body rejected the blood.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.830
Do you have any idea where he might be?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.549
Last I heard, he was teaching somewhere.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.870
Lucas was a very stubborn man.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.758
Personally, I expected him
to continue his work

32:39.840 --> 32:42.513
on improving Lane's theories
on transfusion, regardless.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.919
Lane's theories?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.752
Yes, Samuel Armstrong Lane,

32:45.840 --> 32:49.515
the first man to treat haemophilia
with blood transfusions in the 1840s.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.029
You know the name?

32:51.120 --> 32:52.951
The headmaster
at the Tepes School for Girls

32:53.040 --> 32:55.270
calls himself Samuel Lane.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.829
George!

32:57.800 --> 32:59.199
Telephone Toronto General Hospital

32:59.280 --> 33:02.636
and find out if Daniel Irvin
was ever treated for haemophilia.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.389
Sir.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.675
Where are they?

33:11.760 --> 33:12.795
Who?

33:12.880 --> 33:14.359
Your son and Dr Lucas Harwick?

33:14.440 --> 33:17.318
Or Samuel Lane,
as he goes by these days.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.313
- My son is dead...
- Your son is a haemophiliac.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.193
He and Dr Harwick have been
abducting girls at this school

33:24.280 --> 33:26.077
to tap them for transfusable blood.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.997
You helped your son stage his own death
to avoid going to prison

33:30.240 --> 33:32.708
because you knew
his disease would kill him.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.349
Where are they, ma'am?

33:37.640 --> 33:39.153
My son is dying.

33:40.040 --> 33:43.430
Dr Harwick is his only hope.
You mustn't interfere. Please.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.435
Where are they?

33:47.040 --> 33:49.031
In the coach house.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.073
This fellow's blood
is not compatible, Mrs Irvin.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.679
They know, Lucas.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.354
Dr Harwick, where's Daniel?

34:14.280 --> 34:15.507
He's in a coma.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.717
When he learned of Amy's death,
he slit his wrists.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.438
He loved her.
He didn't want to cause any more harm.

34:23.639 --> 34:26.791
Then that would explain
the sudden increase in attacks.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.757
You needed more blood
to replenish what Daniel was losing.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.598
Not everyone's compatible.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.911
If he doesn't get more blood
in the next few hours, he'll die.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.275
This man is unconscious.
What's he been given?

34:38.360 --> 34:39.429
The same thing
we gave the girls.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.431
A mixture of barbituric acid and heroin.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.748
He'll awaken soon.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.556
George, telephone the station house

34:45.639 --> 34:47.915
and get a half dozen constables
down here immediately.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.592
- Sir.
- And call for Dr Ogden, as well.

34:49.679 --> 34:50.998
- Sir.
- Right, then.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.831
You can start with me.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.954
Now, Doctor.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.749
Do not take more than one pint,
Dr Harwick.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.876
You may test my blood next,
if you please.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.034
Daniel's regaining consciousness.
He's very weak, Detective.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.031
No more than a few minutes,
then let him rest.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.474
Daniel.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.232
I'm Detective Murdoch.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.592
I need to know what happened
the night that Amy Goldham died.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.069
She woke up,

35:49.640 --> 35:50.709
here.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.195
During the transfusion procedure?

35:54.800 --> 35:56.472
She panicked.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.389
She pulled the tube out and she ran.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.837
I chased after her.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.917
I had to explain.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.798
Where was Dr Harwick?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.797
He was at the mausoleum.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.356
Preparing it for me to bring Amy back.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.472
So, you chased after her?

36:14.160 --> 36:15.878
Did you push her into the pond?

36:16.720 --> 36:17.789
No.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.757
She knelt by the water.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.752
She just fell in.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.998
She probably fainted from the blood loss
and exertion.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.672
Why didn't you pull her out?

36:28.760 --> 36:29.954
I did.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.557
I turned her onto her back.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.110
Then I ran off to find Dr Harwick.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.710
Amy was breathing when I left.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.073
I swear it.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.997
Someone pushed her back in

36:44.240 --> 36:46.310
and held her down with their foot.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.870
Who was it? Dr Harwick?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.355
No.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.318
I found him here.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.234
I tried to tell him what happened
to Amy.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.393
But I was so weak, I just collapsed.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.633
He had to tend to me,

37:01.040 --> 37:02.712
or I would have died.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.392
Then who killed Amy?

37:08.720 --> 37:10.870
Your son didn't hold Amy
under the water,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.234
and neither did Dr Harwick.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.270
There's only one other person
who would have felt threatened

37:15.360 --> 37:17.157
by what Amy had discovered.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.800
And that was you, wasn't it, Mrs Irvin?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.228
Me?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.272
I didn't kill her.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.277
You had one very good reason.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.718
Daniel's survival,

37:27.800 --> 37:30.314
the truth of what Dr Harwick
had been doing

37:30.400 --> 37:31.628
could never come out.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.439
I would never,
not even to save my son's life.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.397
You staged your son's death.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.876
You would go to any length to save him.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.518
You love your son.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.830
Before Amy,
none of the girls ever suffered.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.194
I insisted on that.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.349
If Dr Harwick hadn't agreed to my terms,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.597
I would have let my son die.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.398
But someone turned Amy back down
into the water.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.153
If not you, if not Daniel or Dr Harwick,

37:56.240 --> 37:57.309
then who?

37:57.560 --> 38:00.677
I can't imagine anybody
who would wish that sweet girl harm.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.595
She was the most popular girl
in the school.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.668
She was?

38:09.280 --> 38:11.157
But that wasn't always the case, was it?

38:20.080 --> 38:21.513
Miss Dennett.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.799
Hello, Detective.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.159
Arlene,

38:31.320 --> 38:32.878
who wrote this note?

38:34.200 --> 38:36.236
I wrote it myself,

38:36.320 --> 38:37.912
and I am ashamed that I did.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.069
I truly am.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.597
Actually, I've compared the handwriting
to some of the entries in Amy's diary.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.194
She wrote it.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.874
They're supposedly from the vampire
to you.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.798
Why would Amy do that?

38:56.760 --> 39:00.150
For some time, you had been
the most popular girl at the school.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.630
And you couldn't understand
why the vampire hadn't chosen you.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.718
Isn't that right?

39:07.120 --> 39:08.189
Yes.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.836
You and Amy had been friends.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.558
Best friends.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.797
But all that changed when she met
her mystery man, didn't it?

39:19.640 --> 39:23.394
Suddenly, all of the other girls
were looking up to her.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.638
You were jealous.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.439
You were the prettiest.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.478
The vampire should have chosen you,
not Amy.

39:33.320 --> 39:36.949
I suspect your relationship soured
very quickly after that.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.230
And that's why she played
this trick on you.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.795
I really thought that it was from him.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.870
I thought that he'd finally chosen me.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.191
<i>So you went
to meet the vampire,</i>

39:58.280 --> 39:59.793
<i>full of anticipation.</i>

40:01.840 --> 40:03.159
<i>But he wasn't there.</i>

40:04.720 --> 40:06.836
And rather than admit this,

40:06.920 --> 40:09.036
you told everyone that you had met him.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.991
They already knew the truth

40:12.080 --> 40:13.832
and you were humiliated.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.952
How could she do that to me?

40:17.640 --> 40:20.473
I would never have done that
to her, ever.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.870
That's why you spent the night
in the infirmary.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.596
You were planning to tell on Amy
when she got back from her rendezvous,

40:27.680 --> 40:28.749
weren't you?

40:29.560 --> 40:30.959
But you were impatient.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.678
<i>So, you went outside.</i>

40:34.680 --> 40:37.069
<i>And that's when you saw
Amy fall into the pond</i>

40:37.160 --> 40:39.958
<i>and Daniel pull her out and run off.</i>

40:41.880 --> 40:45.077
<i>Then you saw your chance
to get back at Amy</i>

40:45.160 --> 40:46.718
<i>for humiliating you</i>

40:47.680 --> 40:50.513
<i>and becoming the new most popular girl.</i>

40:55.840 --> 40:58.798
She was a nobody
when she came to the school.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.516
She was scared every day.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.752
I befriended her, I protected her.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.751
She was only popular
because I was popular.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.192
How could she do that to me?

41:16.400 --> 41:20.154
I was the laughing stock
of the entire school.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.716
What we did was wrong,

41:28.800 --> 41:30.791
but it was done to save a life.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.590
Daniel's grandfather was a haemophiliac,

41:33.680 --> 41:35.432
who died because of transfusion.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.789
Explaining the disappearances
at the Tepes School 40 years ago.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.433
In any case, Mrs Irvin couldn't bear
to lose her father and son.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.513
And it's not just their lives,
Detective, but thousands, millions,

41:47.600 --> 41:50.034
who could benefit
from safe blood transfusion.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.636
I believe that will happen, Dr Harwick,

41:55.520 --> 41:57.590
but you will be in prison when it does.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.908
You'd better not be writing that
murder mystery on my time, Crabtree.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.115
Sir, I'm not.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.952
In fact, right now,
I'm not writing anything.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.713
I've almost finished
what is sure to be a thrilling climax,

42:21.800 --> 42:23.552
but now I can't think of an ending.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.677
I lie awake at night dreaming
about the ending of your bloody story.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.592
- Good night, Murdoch.
- Good night, sir.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.434
Perhaps what you need
is a surprise dramatic element, George.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.831
A twist, as it were.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.797
"A twist"?

42:41.880 --> 42:45.634
Where the villain isn't necessarily
who we think it is,

42:45.720 --> 42:46.789
or some such.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.272
Oh, for the love of...

42:59.200 --> 43:00.235
Julia.

43:00.560 --> 43:01.629
Ah, William.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.515
How is Daniel?

43:03.720 --> 43:06.109
Well, Darcy says his wrists are healing.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.670
Apparently, the substantial transfusion
we gave him allowed his blood to clot.

43:09.760 --> 43:10.988
Saved his life.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.195
Very good.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.953
And the young girl? Arlene?

43:15.040 --> 43:18.271
Her parents have hired
an army of very expensive lawyers

43:18.360 --> 43:20.396
to mount her defence.
I doubt she'll hang.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.591
She was clever, I'll give her that.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.355
Playing innocent and defenceless.

43:27.560 --> 43:30.677
Tools women frequently use
to attract a man.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.595
I don't believe I was aware of that
where Arlene was concerned.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.999
Of course not.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.709
That's the way the mating dance works,
isn't it?

43:41.120 --> 43:43.953
The female sends out her signals
and the male reacts.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.195
She'll toss back her hair,

43:47.280 --> 43:50.829
and expose her neck,
her most vulnerable aspect.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.472
Hence the visceral response
to the vampire's bite.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.871
Fangs and such.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.398
Just so. Yes.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.680
And the lure of steady eye contact,

44:03.760 --> 44:05.432
powerful and unblinking.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.430
A clearer message could not be sent.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.035
Julia.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.155
Darcy!

44:26.200 --> 44:28.111
Have you given it to the detective yet?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.069
I'm sorry?

44:30.520 --> 44:31.635
The invitation.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.550
Oh, my goodness. Yes.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.394
I almost forgot.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.831
William, here.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.229
It's the invitation to our wedding.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.031
Yes. Of course.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.229
Thank you.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.509
Thank you, both.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.555
I must be off.
