00:34.500 --> 00:36.567
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.133
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.167 --> 00:40.933
in a court of law.

00:42.533 --> 00:44.600
-You know, to say that you get
scared out here,

00:44.633 --> 00:46.867
I don't know if I'd say
it's scared, it's more...

00:46.900 --> 00:49.067
nervous, it's a--
it's a heightened awareness.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.333
That's just normal,
and if we arrive on a call

00:52.367 --> 00:54.200
and the back of our hair
starts to stand up,

00:54.233 --> 00:57.167
that's your body, your mind
tellin' you that now
it's survival time,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.267

how we get through this--

00:59.300 --> 01:01.067

01:10.767 --> 01:13.733
Uh, he's shooting out windows
and at a propane tank.

01:13.767 --> 01:17.267
We have an officer
who has arrived and has eyes
on the subject.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.900
He's currently laying
on the ground, I don't know

01:18.933 --> 01:21.467
if he's down and still
has the firearm in his hand
or not.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.467
Hold on. We've arrived.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.067

03:13.733 --> 03:16.067
-Don't know.
-You don't know?

03:16.100 --> 03:17.533

03:24.567 --> 03:25.600
Why?

03:29.233 --> 03:31.533

03:37.167 --> 03:39.067
-You takin' somethin' tonight?

03:39.067 --> 03:41.333

03:41.367 --> 03:42.433
What's that, man?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.700
-I just wanna die.
-You just wanne die?

03:44.733 --> 03:46.400
Okay, where's the gun at, man?

03:46.433 --> 03:48.467
-(radio chatter)
-It's over there?

03:48.500 --> 03:52.267
-Radio voice:
We have two magazines
by the air compressor,

03:52.300 --> 03:54.733
we're trying to locate...

03:54.767 --> 03:56.067
-Who called us?
-I did.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.967
-Just run me through
what happened,
what you saw, okay?

03:58.067 --> 04:02.433
-He... you know, came in
earlier, bought some water,
left. I came out

04:02.467 --> 04:05.900
to have a cigarette,
he goes over to our
air compressor system...

04:05.933 --> 04:07.933
-Okay.
-pulls out a gun,
just starts shooting...

04:07.967 --> 04:09.733
-Was he saying anything
when he was shooting the gun?

04:09.767 --> 04:12.067
-No, he just--
-You ever seen him here
at this store?

04:12.100 --> 04:16.433
-Uhh... probably like
long time ago,
but not, like, recently.

04:16.467 --> 04:19.567
-Okay.
-And then he... loads
a new magazine,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.967
continues to shoot,
and then walks over
to the wall and sits down.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.500
-And that was it?
-That was it.

04:24.533 --> 04:26.267
-Okay, well, he's out of it,
we're gonna get him, uh,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.067
medical attention.
Good job on you guys callin',

04:28.067 --> 04:30.200
seriously, man.
All the details
that you gave us

04:30.233 --> 04:32.933
was able to get us here
precisely to where he was at.

04:34.267 --> 04:35.867
Hey, Corie, where you able
to find the, uh, gun?

04:35.900 --> 04:39.233
-Yeah. For some reason
he stashed the gun over here
in the bushes.

04:39.267 --> 04:43.400
You can see some magazines.
And, uh, he ended up
starting to shoot at this tank.

04:43.433 --> 04:46.100
We're not really sure
if he was tryin' to blow it up,
we're not really sure--

04:46.133 --> 04:48.667
-'Cause that
was the initial details, right?
That he was standing outside,

04:48.700 --> 04:50.333
shooting at propane tanks?

04:50.367 --> 04:52.567
-Yeah, and as you can see,
it's pretty thick.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.833
These are all the remnants
of the, uh, bullets.

04:54.867 --> 04:57.600
You can see the casings
over here. These are just
some of 'em.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.667
And he was actually firin'
through this fence.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.200
-Boy, you can see
all the impacts, too.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.200
-These were the actual rounds
that hit him.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.800
-The beanbags were effective.
Absolutely effective.

05:06.833 --> 05:11.067
Now, that he pulled outta
the bag as you were givin' him
the verbal commands.

05:11.067 --> 05:13.300
-Yeah, for some reason,
he kept reachin' in his bag,

05:13.333 --> 05:15.933
actin' like he had a weapon.
But he did pull that out.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.167
-I have never seen somebody
on marijuana act the way--

05:18.200 --> 05:20.067
there was definitely
somethin' else.

05:20.067 --> 05:23.667
We just got a call
from one of the other officers.
Our suspect is now alert.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.500
Hey, James?
How are you, man?

05:27.533 --> 05:29.200
I just wanna see how you
were feelin'.

05:29.233 --> 05:30.867
I'm, uh, here, dude,
if you wanna look at me,

05:30.900 --> 05:33.500
I was one of the officers
that was first arriving
out there.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.733
Uh, how you feelin'?

05:34.767 --> 05:36.400
-Talked me down.
-Yeah.

05:36.433 --> 05:37.600
-Like I was on a ledge,
-Yeah.

05:37.633 --> 05:40.800
-with a pretty small curb.
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.467
You feelin' better now?
-Yeah.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.867
-What was, uh, what was
goin' through your head?

05:45.900 --> 05:49.633
-Uhh... heard "lethal"
and kept my fingers crossed.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.700
-Heard lethal?
Why? Did you want us
to use lethal force on you?

05:53.733 --> 05:56.067
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?

05:56.100 --> 05:58.800
What-- what-- what's goin' on,
man, you-- you havin'
some-- some bad thoughts,

05:58.833 --> 06:00.633
or, things tough right now?

06:00.667 --> 06:01.900
-Nah.
-No?

06:01.933 --> 06:03.867
-Just, uh... thought I'd died
recently, so,

06:03.900 --> 06:04.933
wanted to make sure.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.233
-How did you think you died?

06:06.267 --> 06:07.267
-Overdose.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.733
-You overdosed?

06:08.767 --> 06:11.067
Were you, uh, were--
were you on anything tonight?

06:11.067 --> 06:14.067
-Yeah.
-What'd you take?

06:15.067 --> 06:17.733
-Uhh, some crystal...
-Some crystal?

06:17.767 --> 06:19.433
-some weed...
-Weed?

06:19.467 --> 06:22.467
Did you hear us askin' you
to drop-- drop the backpack
and get your hands out

06:22.500 --> 06:23.833
of the backpack?
-Yeah.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.900
-Wh-- Why-- Why were you
refusing to?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.400
-Tryin' to, uh...
push you.

06:29.433 --> 06:30.633
-Push us?
-Yeah.

06:30.667 --> 06:33.133
-To do what?
Pull the trigger?

06:33.167 --> 06:35.833
-Use lethal.
-Use lethal force?

06:35.867 --> 06:37.367
-Oh.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.700
I'm glad that the--
the beanbag worked.
Did you feel the beanbag?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.767
-Yeah, the one in the chest
hurt the most.
-That hurt the most?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.500
Did you feel the other ones
that were hit at you?

06:43.533 --> 06:46.067
You understand why we--
we hit you with it, though?

06:46.067 --> 06:47.467
Keep you away
from that backpack?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.367
-Yeah.
-'Cause we didn't know
that you had dropped the gun,

06:49.400 --> 06:50.933
we thought the gun
was still in the backpack.

06:50.967 --> 06:53.133
Did-- Did you think
shooting at that structure,
that was gonna

06:53.167 --> 06:54.467
get us called there?

06:54.500 --> 06:56.633
-I was hoping it was gonna
explode, but... (laughs)

06:56.667 --> 06:58.733
-Oh, you were hopin'
it was gonna explode?

06:58.767 --> 07:02.500
The panel on it is so thick,
brother, it would've taken
a whole lot.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.967
-Yeah, it took 26 rounds.
-26 rounds?

07:05.067 --> 07:06.467
You remember-- Were you
countin' 'em?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.400
-Well, 13 rounds in a clip,
and there are two clips.

07:09.433 --> 07:11.400
-Okay, do-- do you know
what you're goin' to jail for?

07:11.433 --> 07:13.867
Okay, it's the destruction
of private property,

07:13.900 --> 07:17.733
and then also discharging
a firearm where somebody
can be endangered.

07:17.767 --> 07:21.067
Now, hey, uh, you seem
like a decent guy, and I think
we need to get you--

07:21.100 --> 07:22.833
get you the right help.
You know, brother?

07:22.867 --> 07:26.233
You know, if there's, uh,
ever a time that you're feelin'
down and out,

07:26.267 --> 07:28.067
we're not just here
to take people to jail,

07:28.100 --> 07:29.600
you know, you can always
call and talk to us.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.500
-I appreciate it.
-It's from the bottom
of my heart, dude,

07:31.533 --> 07:32.633
I wish you the best.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.700
-So, I'm the oldest
in the family of four.

07:36.733 --> 07:39.533
And, just early on I told
my parents that...

07:39.567 --> 07:42.300
I wanna grow up to be a cop.
And I wanna be a Marine.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.900
And it just took 'em
by surprise,

07:43.933 --> 07:46.500
'cause I'll be the only one
in my family to do that.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.600
But, after a couple years
of them fighting against it,

07:49.633 --> 07:51.200
now I get nothing but support
from them.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.600
They're very proud
of what I've become,

07:52.633 --> 07:55.467
what I'm doin' with my life.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.767
We're headed to a call
for service on malicious
destruction of private property.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.067
Between neighbors dispute,
seems like one of them
smashed out

08:01.100 --> 08:02.433
the other's window.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.300
Arriving shortly now.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.333
-(radio chatter)

08:14.500 --> 08:17.200
-(radio chatter)

08:17.233 --> 08:18.667
-Hello.
-Hi.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.367
-Barbara gave us a call, right?
-Yes.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.433
-Tell me what's goin' on.
-My son was sitting
on his bed,

08:22.467 --> 08:24.533
-Okay.
-And I went in there
to tell him that...

08:24.567 --> 08:29.667
dinner was ready,
and... I saw the guy next door
stand up and say,

08:29.700 --> 08:32.100
"I know somebody in there
stole my watch,"

08:32.133 --> 08:34.400
and threw something
and crashed a whole window out.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.367
-Okay, so your neighbors
that live right over here,
to the left of you,

08:37.400 --> 08:39.567
-I know you can't get it
from there, you have
to go round the back.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.233
-Okay, we can go
check that out.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.567
How much you think
all this damage is gonna cost?

08:45.600 --> 08:50.933
-Uh, well, that window alone
is gonna cost about 7
or $800 to replace.

08:50.967 --> 08:52.600
-Okay.
So we'll be right back, okay?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.233
Just let me contact them,
see what they say.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.733
-(knocking on door)
-(dog barking)

08:57.767 --> 09:00.600
-Metro Police.
-How are you doin', guys?

09:00.633 --> 09:02.433
-What's up, man?
You wanna come out here
for me, please?

09:02.467 --> 09:04.100
-Yeah.
-Just take a seat
right there, buddy.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.667
Your name's Jeremy, right?
-Yes, sir.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.533
That pussy ass Dave
over there... I tell you what.

09:09.567 --> 09:13.933
-(clearing throat)
-His daughter, I don't know,
or his niece or whatever.

09:13.967 --> 09:16.667
We've been missin' this watch,
dude, for about, I don't know,

09:16.700 --> 09:18.900
I would say about four
or five months.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.900
And... we tell her today
about it, and she's all like,

09:21.933 --> 09:23.833
"Yeah, Dave gave it to us."

09:23.867 --> 09:25.533
So that means you're tellin' me
that fool,

09:25.567 --> 09:28.067
for the last four months
he's been, "Oh, no,
I ain't seen that,

09:28.067 --> 09:30.067
"I've-- I've never seen it."

09:30.067 --> 09:32.533
And then she comes over
and gives me the watch back?

09:32.567 --> 09:34.167
-Well, what happened
with the-- the windows, man?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.300
-I threw a tamale at it.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.567
-A tamale?
-Yeah.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.233
You didn't see it
layin' on the ground over there?

09:38.267 --> 09:40.667
-No.
-Um, he probably
picked it up, then.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.433
I never even went
on that property.

09:42.467 --> 09:43.667
-So they gave it back, though.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.967
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.400
-Still gonna get
an ass-whoopin'.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.167
-All right, buddy.
Right now, they wanna
press charges

09:48.200 --> 09:50.467
for the whole
property damage. Okay.
-On a window?

09:50.500 --> 09:51.833
-Yeah.
So you're gonna have
to go to court

09:51.867 --> 09:54.133
-Just come over here.
-Press charges
for a damn window?

09:54.167 --> 09:56.100
-Just walk with me
over to the car, man.
-Yeah.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.633
-Okay... so, Jeremy's
being arrested, okay?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.933
But it wasn't a rock,
exactly, it was a tamale.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.567
-A tamale?
-A tamale?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.867
-He said he broke
your window, and he damaged
your property with a tamale.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.367
-He admitted it?
-Yep.
He said he threw it

10:08.400 --> 10:10.467
at your window, he admitted
to it, and everything...

10:10.500 --> 10:11.800
-Boy, that person's
a horrible cook.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.533
-So, he's being arrested
for a gross misdemeanor offense

10:13.567 --> 10:15.033
due to the property damage,
all right?

10:15.067 --> 10:17.100
-Does he have a warrant?
-He also has a warrant out
for his arrest.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.667
-That's what I figured,
everybody does.
(laughs)

10:18.700 --> 10:21.967
-Um, also, I need to speak
with David. Could he
step out, please?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.033
-It was his room
that it happened in.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.900
-Got it.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.133
-Yes.
-Hey, David.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.733
Real quick, for the watch
that he thought you stole?

10:29.767 --> 10:32.200
And you gave it back?
'Cause he's tellin' us
that you actually gave it back

10:32.233 --> 10:33.667
to them.
-No.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.133
-Nothin'? Don't remember it?

10:36.333 --> 10:38.100
-That's what this
is all about?

10:38.133 --> 10:39.733
-Uh, that's what he's sayin'
he's upset about.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.500
-Hm.
-He's upset, he said he wanted
to fight you,

10:42.533 --> 10:43.900
but you were inside
the residence,

10:43.933 --> 10:46.033
so he threw a tamale
at your window.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.633
-But that's what makes
me mad is because
if you're pissed at him,

10:48.667 --> 10:51.833
why the heck do you have
to destroy my property?

10:51.867 --> 10:53.800
-Unfortunately, that's the way
it goes sometimes.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.167
Uh, could you take us
back there and see if you could
find that tamale

10:56.200 --> 10:57.867
that he's claiming
he threw at the window?

10:57.900 --> 10:59.233
-(dog barking)

11:01.300 --> 11:03.067
-That? Probably that?

11:03.067 --> 11:04.267
-That's a tamale.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.633
-And that right there.
-Tamale.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.833
-But that person must
be a really horrible cook,

11:07.867 --> 11:10.800
if that was hard enough
to break a window.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.867
-Yeah.
-Seriously.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.967
-I'm guessing, yep,
that's splattered tamale.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.633
I didn't-- couldn't tell
what that was earlier.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.067
(dog barking)

11:19.067 --> 11:20.800
-Hey, Jeremy.
-Yes, sir.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.833
-Hey, man, so I understand
you would like to fix
their window.

11:23.867 --> 11:26.133
-I got a window
sittin' over there right now.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.300
-So you don't mind
to fix their window?
That's what I'm getting.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.967
-Yeah. I don't mind.
-'Cause I'll talk to them,

11:30.067 --> 11:32.300
man, and I'll let 'em know
that you're all for that.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.733
And that way I don't have
to take you to jail
for the $800.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.300
-All right.
So I'll just go
on the traffic warrant.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.600
-You'll just go
on the traffic warrant.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.067
-Right.
-Okay, so I'll see
what they think about it,

11:41.067 --> 11:43.200
and we'll go from there?

11:43.233 --> 11:45.500
Okay, he says he actually
has a window at his residence.

11:45.533 --> 11:48.100
He is saying he will fix it,
and do all the labor
and everything like that.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.967
And replace the window.
Okay? If that's what you guys
wanna do,

11:51.067 --> 11:52.267
we can handle this civilly.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.833
The malicious destruction
of private property--

11:53.867 --> 11:55.400
-But my problem
is I don't trust him.

11:55.433 --> 11:59.100
If he was to go get
the window, could you
put the new window in?

11:59.133 --> 12:00.367
-Yeah, I can do it.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.267
-If you can get him
to bring the window over here,

12:02.300 --> 12:03.567
he will put it in.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.300
-Hello. You mind
if we come in?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.933
-We just moved in.
-Jeremy said he has a window

12:15.967 --> 12:18.233
that he can give to them
so they can fix it.
-Yeah.

12:18.267 --> 12:22.067
-Yeah.
If you want, I'll pull it out
or somethin'?

12:22.100 --> 12:25.900
-Ooh.
There you go. Cool.
-(laughs)

12:25.933 --> 12:29.267
-Okay. Let's go see
if this fits, and then that way,

12:29.300 --> 12:31.633
he can get that charge dropped.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.067
-(dog barking)

12:44.267 --> 12:46.333
-It's a little...
-It can be cut down.

12:46.367 --> 12:47.933
-It's big. But...

12:47.967 --> 12:50.100
-Well, we can cut it down
to fit.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.400
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:51.433 --> 12:54.433
-All right. So you guys
are good with this window, then?

12:54.467 --> 12:55.667
-It's up to you.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.867
-If you can--
If you can cut it down
to fit it,

12:57.900 --> 13:00.300
and make it fit, Jerry.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.733
Do you think you could?

13:01.767 --> 13:04.100
-It looks like
the width is right.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.467
-Yeah, the width
is just about right, so...

13:06.500 --> 13:09.800
-Yeah, the width is right.
-Okay.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.633
Well, Jeremy, you got away
with something 'cause
your neighbors

13:12.667 --> 13:14.400
were being very cooperative
with you.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.567
You're just gonna go
for your warrants.
They're being cool

13:16.600 --> 13:18.400
where they accepted it,
they're droppin'
all the charges

13:18.433 --> 13:20.067
on the malicious destruction
of private property.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.333
The glass fit, they just need
to cut it down a bit. Okay?

13:22.367 --> 13:25.900
They don't want...
any problems with you
whatsoever... okay?

13:25.933 --> 13:27.900
-I-- I don't even
know the people
that own the place.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.433
-Yeah, they just don't want you
to be throwin' stuff
at their house anymore.

13:30.467 --> 13:31.633
-(laughs)
-All right?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.200
-No more tamales
through the window, buddy.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.400
-Yes, sir.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.933
-Comin' from, uh,
the Marine Corps
into law enforcement

13:39.967 --> 13:42.200
it seemed like
a-- a natural transition.

13:42.233 --> 13:45.567
You know, hangin' around
with the... same type
of people,

13:45.600 --> 13:46.967
people wantin' to look out
for each other.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.167
This is what I wanna do
to-- to help out

13:49.200 --> 13:52.400
those around me
and, you know, do what I can

13:52.433 --> 13:54.500
for the community.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.500
The hotel
we're goin' to is, uh, known
for illegal activity,

13:57.533 --> 14:00.067
prostitution, drugs,
things like that.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.267
Uh, usually we find people
hangin' out in the cars

14:02.300 --> 14:03.967
in this
little parking structure,

14:04.067 --> 14:06.567
and, you know, here's one
over here now, so...

14:06.600 --> 14:08.300
we'll, uh, we'll...
stop and talk to him,

14:08.333 --> 14:10.067
and see what's goin' on.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.367
Hi, there.
You have, uh, ID or anything?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.533
You on probation or parole?

14:20.567 --> 14:22.933
-No.
-All right. Just gotta do
a quick check.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.167
-See, I got a room key.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.433
-Do you have your ID?

14:28.233 --> 14:30.667
-Look, I'm a listed guest.
I have a room here.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.167
-Okay, I'll just go
with your, uh, name
and all that stuff.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.900
All right?

14:34.933 --> 14:37.267
-What's your, uh...?
-What-- What's the problem?

14:37.300 --> 14:40.133
-Because management up here
tells us to come by and check
on things.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.700
-This is harassment,
I've done nothing,
I'm a registered guest.

14:42.733 --> 14:45.733
You guys came in here,
I gave you my ID,
I showed the key.

14:45.767 --> 14:49.367
This is-- I gotta work,
I got school, I gotta go
to my program,

14:49.400 --> 14:53.500
for a Cypress Mandela
project in the morning.
This is ridiculous.

14:53.533 --> 14:54.867
This is really ridiculous.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.533
-Hey, just let him know
he's on probation.

14:57.567 --> 14:59.667
-'Cause right now
you're in violation
of probation, so...

14:59.700 --> 15:01.567
-I'm not in violation
of my probation.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.567
I'm not on probation.
-You have to, uh,
go with our search.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.067
-I am not on probation.

15:06.067 --> 15:09.300
I'm not getting out
of this car.
I did nothing wrong.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.767
I was-- I was supposed
to call a lawyer.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.700
-All right, and you're
on probation, so part
of your probation

15:12.733 --> 15:14.233
is, uh, for us
to do a check.

15:14.267 --> 15:17.333
-I was released off probation,
on the 30th of this last--
of August,

15:17.367 --> 15:21.767
I am not on probation...
-Nope. It's showin'
that you're still on probation.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.967
-I need-- I need to talk
to the sergeant, please,
captain, somethin'.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.633
I've done nothing wrong,
my hands are in plain sight.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.733
Please, sir, I'm-- I'm--
I'm in fear for my life.

15:29.767 --> 15:33.633
-All right, here's the thing...
my sergeant's gonna come here
anyways. But right now,

15:33.667 --> 15:36.133
if you don't step out
of the vehicle, we're gonna
break the window,

15:36.167 --> 15:38.633
and we're pullin' you out.
-This is harassment. Period.

15:38.667 --> 15:42.067
-No. Not harassment.
-I did nothing wrong.
I'm a registered guest.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.067
I gave you my ID.
-Hey, can you, uh,
check crims, make sure?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.433
-Yeah.
-What's up, buddy?

15:46.467 --> 15:47.567
-How you doin', sir?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.967
-How are you?
-I'm a registered guest here.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.267
-Let me explain something
to you, okay?

15:50.300 --> 15:51.300
You're on probation. It's f--

15:51.333 --> 15:52.667
Let me-- Let me finish.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.333
You're on probation per
our records.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.500
Okay? We've checked it twice.

15:56.533 --> 15:58.333
And we're going to do
a compliance check.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.467
I'm askin' you to go
with the program, okay?

16:00.500 --> 16:03.867
If you've got nothin' to hide,
you'll be about your way.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.867
Okay?
If you do
got somethin' to hide,

16:06.900 --> 16:08.567
honesty's your best option
right now.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.467
Okay? Open up the door.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.067
Come on out, bud.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.467
Put your stuff down,
come on out.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.767
Come on.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.700
Face the car.
Face the car.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.467
Put your stuff on the--
Put your stuff on top.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.200
Put your stuff on the car.

16:26.233 --> 16:28.133
Set it down.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.800
Let me see your hands.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.400
-Hey, Marco, can you check him?
I'll check the vehicle.
-Yeah.

16:36.367 --> 16:41.100
-We found, uh, marijuana,
couple bags of it, and then
also, uh, concentrated cannabis.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.467
-That's probably
what he didn't want us
to see.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.067
-And we're still searching
the car to see what else
we have.

16:46.067 --> 16:50.300
We found crack cocaine.
Looks he was, uh, cutting.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.833
Also has a scale, for sales.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.500
Baggies, and something
that was already, uh, cut.

16:59.533 --> 17:02.833
So it confirmed our suspicion
he was up to badness here
at the... hotel.

17:02.867 --> 17:05.100
And we're gonna do
a probation search on his room.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.500
-(knocking on door)

17:07.533 --> 17:09.167
-Sheriff's office.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
Hello! Sheriff's office.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.067
Hi.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.700
How are you?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.567
You on probation, parole
or anything?

17:16.600 --> 17:17.867
-Uh, yes, I'm on probation.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.400
-Okay. Come on, stand on up.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.533
What are you on probation for?

17:22.567 --> 17:25.333
-Um, I'm probably on probation
for, like...

17:25.367 --> 17:26.733
-Okay, turn around.
-Yes.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.533
-You're not under arrest
or anything, just
being detained.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.800
-Okay.
-Your friend, Brandon,
he's on probation,

17:30.833 --> 17:32.800
so we can search, uh,
his room.

17:32.833 --> 17:34.800
-Okay.
-Is there anything illegal
in the room, young lady?

17:34.833 --> 17:36.533
-Oh, no.
-Come on over this way.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.567
-What kind of car
do you drive?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.200
-Um, I don't have no car.

17:39.233 --> 17:40.367
-Whose keys are these?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.433
-That's a Chevy key,
so what--

17:41.467 --> 17:43.067
-I don't have no car,

17:43.067 --> 17:46.400
so whatever you guys
needs to do, you guys
just need to do it, I guess.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.600
-All right, okay.
Fair enough.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.800
-All right.
-We'll do what
we gotta do.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.067
We found the-- the keys,
came out here
to the parking lot,

17:54.067 --> 17:56.367
and we're doin'
a probation search
on the-- the vehicle

17:56.400 --> 17:59.167
to see if, uh...
we find any type
of contraband

17:59.200 --> 18:00.867
or anything like that.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.567
Here we go, here's
all the drugs.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.067
The little side compartment
has all the little bindles
for individual sales.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.567
Two big bindles,
some more marijuana.

18:10.133 --> 18:13.967
So it's also got, uh...
account numbers goin'
along with it,

18:14.067 --> 18:16.833
so that'll all be seized
as evidence, too.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.267
Investigation can do
what they gotta do
to see if, uh...

18:19.300 --> 18:22.067
they can write a warrant
for the accounts.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.933
And some blue pills,
you just do a Google search
to find out what they are.

18:25.967 --> 18:28.167
Go with "round pill, blue,"
and then those numbers.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.833
You said the keys
didn't belong to you.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.333
Looked inside the car,
found out the car
was yours,

18:33.367 --> 18:35.933
and that's when we found
the, uh, suspected
crack cocaine

18:35.967 --> 18:38.800
in individual little baggies.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.067
And then we also found
the little blue pills,
which are OxyContin.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.500
-No, I have no OxyContin
in my car.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.233
I have multiple sclerosis,

18:46.267 --> 18:48.400
so if any way that you can
collect all them...

18:48.433 --> 18:51.067
-Oh, yeah, we collected
everything for evidence.
-...medicine, yeah, containers.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.333
-Yeah, it's all collected
for evidence.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.500
-Right, so it can get
took in, so--

18:53.533 --> 18:55.200
That's not no OxyContin, sir.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.600
-Well, you're goin'
to Santa Rita for...
-No problem.

18:57.633 --> 18:59.233
Yeah. No problem, thank you.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.567
-I'm just lettin' you know,
how we-- how we got here.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.533
-Okay, thank you.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.700
-Okay, so did you not
wanna get out of the car
'cause of probation

19:05.733 --> 19:07.500
or because of the drugs
that were found in the car?

19:07.533 --> 19:09.433
-Man, I'm not on probation.
-Okay.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.067
-Once it comes back
after tomorrow or the next day
when I go to court

19:12.100 --> 19:14.733
that I'm not
on probation no more...
-Okay, so that's-- that's fine.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.600
-this search-- the whole search
goes out the window.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.067
-The probation, you're--
you're fine. If you're saying
you're not on probation,

19:19.100 --> 19:21.633
but what about the drugs?
That doesn't do anything
about the drugs in the car.

19:21.667 --> 19:25.433
-Yes-- If there was no cause,
it's an illegal search
and seizure. Period.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.733
-What about the drugs
in the car?

19:26.767 --> 19:28.767
-What drugs, dude?
-The ones that we found
in the car.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.400
The ones right underneath
the driver's seat.

19:30.433 --> 19:34.500
-When--When-- When--
When I go to say
I'm not on--

19:34.533 --> 19:36.867
When I'm not parole
or probation, there's no need...

19:36.900 --> 19:39.433
-So the drugs are gonna
disappear? What happens
to the drugs found in the car?

19:39.467 --> 19:41.933
-I don't know, I don't know
what you found, you wasn't
supposed to find any,

19:41.967 --> 19:43.400
'cause you wasn't supposed
to search my car.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.767
-All right, well...
we found the drugs...

19:44.800 --> 19:46.400
and you're on probation...
-I'm not on probation.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.367
-and you're gonna go to jail
for... possession for sales.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.833
-132 and Bush, I've got him
at gunpoint.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.700
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.733 --> 19:54.900
Cover is code three.

19:54.933 --> 19:58.500
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.700 --> 20:05.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.667
