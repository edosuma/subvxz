(SIREN WAILING)

00:10.640 --> 00:11.914
TOBY: What's going on here?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.638
TRAFFIC OFFICER: Well, a guy
just walked out into traffic.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.551
He looks awake, but he won't say anything.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.711
Hey, sir? How you doing? Can you hear me?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.068
I know you.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.077
- He's a John Doe.
- He's been here 24 hours.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.073
- You still don't know who he is?
- I have no ID, no wallet, no keys, nothing.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.589
We have your test results

00:33.680 --> 00:36.638
and your brain is a little swollen
from the accident,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.551
but otherwise you should be fine.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.709
- Accident?
- Yes.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.717
Did you have any problem
with your memory prior to the accident?

00:45.680 --> 00:46.954
I don't think so.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.510
You have a wife. You have kids, no?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.389
- But you know me?
- You were younger then.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.638
I know, in the eyes.
The eyes haven't changed.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.672
You're Maya's boy.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.518
You've got the gift.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.279
Just like she did.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.559
Come on, Maya. It's time.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.954
- You knew my mother.
- Maya.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.393
You were taking us somewhere.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.109
- Maya changed your name.
- Yes.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.269
Tell me your name again.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.911
- Say it. Your name is Toby.
- Toby.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.513
That's the only name you have now.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.273
- Toby Logan. Say it again.
- Toby Logan.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.475
That's good, sweetheart.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.235
What was your name?

01:38.560 --> 01:41.836
Don't worry, William. It's going to be okay.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.949
William.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.272
My name was William.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.872
(SIREN WAILING)

02:00.000 --> 02:02.958
I saw myself as a kid in his memory.
My name was William.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.678
Your name was Toby
when you were brought to me.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.512
That was before my mother changed it.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.475
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:08.560 --> 02:10.755
Hey. This is my friend, Ray.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.149
He wants to help you.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.035
Hello, Frank.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.589
- Do I know you?
- Don't you remember?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.519
All those years ago?

02:23.520 --> 02:27.559
- I don't know.
- Toby, this is Frank Cardea.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.430
That's right. That's my name. Frank.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.557
RAY: Frank's the one
who brought you to me, Toby.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.073
He's the one who saved your life.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.956
- And you, sir?
- Ray Mercer.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.638
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's good to see you, Frank.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.030
Do you remember
when you brought Toby to me

02:48.120 --> 02:50.429
and told me not to let them find him?

02:50.520 --> 02:52.590
I don't remember, no.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.318
Don't let who find me, Frank?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.793
Oh, well, you're all grown up now, William.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.792
Nobody would possibly recognise you.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.156
(STAMMERING) No, Toby.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.077
Maya said to call you that. Toby Logan.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.879
RAY: That's right, Frank.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.832
You brought Toby to me,
and you told me he almost drowned.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.029
Drowned?

03:23.600 --> 03:24.874

03:25.720 --> 03:27.233
No, no, no. It's okay.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.437
Do you remember pulling me from the river?
Do you remember that?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.593
- Why didn't you come back?
- I did.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.512
Now. Your mother sent me.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.479
Are you saying my mother's alive?

03:47.560 --> 03:51.758
Frank, you told me Toby's mother drowned
20 years ago.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.875
No.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.396
Find him, Frank. Tell him what's happening.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.754
- Toby, what is it?
- I just saw my mother. She's alive.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.037
Frank, do you know why Maya sent you?

04:12.840 --> 04:13.829
I... (STAMMERING)

04:15.680 --> 04:18.319
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right, Frank. We'll let you rest.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.753
No, no, no. Your name is Frank Cardea.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.750
My name is William.
My mother's name is Maya.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.751
- RAY: Toby.
- Maya sent you, Frank.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.070
- Where is she? Where's my mother?
- Toby...

04:27.880 --> 04:29.108
- Toby, come on.
- Frank.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.758
- Please.
- Ray, we gotta get through to him.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.239
There's gotta be something you can do.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.756
The best thing for him right now is rest.
Let his brain heal.

(CAR HORN BLARING)

04:44.080 --> 04:45.399

04:47.160 --> 04:48.912
Toby, what is it? What's wrong?

04:52.160 --> 04:53.673
(SIGHING)

04:54.240 --> 04:56.800
TOBY: It feels like a plane just crashed
through my head.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.836
(VOICES WHISPERING)

05:30.080 --> 05:32.799
I don't know what it was. A car. A crash.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.871
- It wasn't coming from Frank?
- It came from out of nowhere.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.837
These beacons don't come
from out of nowhere.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.955
This was different, Ray.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.793
Usually, I'm able to place it to something,
a place, anything.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.519
But this... It was like it was coming
straight for me.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.272
Toby, you really should go home
and get some rest.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.952
This guy knows my mother's alive.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.600
I'm not going anywhere.
I need to get through to him.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.514
- Hey, what are you guys doing here so late?
- I'm trying to get Toby to go home.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.876
What's the matter with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.473
I'm fine, Liv. Thank you.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.434
Toby?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.792
Okay, what is going on?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.994
I think you're gonna have to try
and get that out of Toby.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.551
(SOFTLY) I'll see you tomorrow, Frank.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.149
Toby?

06:34.200 --> 06:37.715
- You gonna shut me out of this one, too?
- It's a long story, Liv.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.076
- Yeah, well, I'm a good listener.
- All right. His name is Frank Cardea

06:41.160 --> 06:43.720
- and he does know me.
- How? From where?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.358
He knows me from a long time ago.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.194
- My mother sent him to tell me some things.
- Your mother?

06:48.280 --> 06:49.395
Mmm-hmm.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.959
- I thought she...
- She's alive.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.429
Oh, my God.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.239
So if I can get through to him,
he can tell me where she is.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.038
Okay, well, if there's anything that I can do...

06:58.120 --> 06:59.678
No, there's nothing,
unless you have a magic wand

06:59.760 --> 07:02.149
and you can bring back his memory.
That would be really kind of special.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.878
No, I don't have a wand.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.554
But I have a pencil. I'll make some calls.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.200
See if there's anything new going on
with head trauma patients,

07:09.280 --> 07:12.238
maybe some experimental medication
with clinical trials would help.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.311
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.954
Okay.

How's it looking?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.151
Okay, thank you.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.151
- Where you at?
- D's.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.231
Great. You only got
80 or 90 more hotels in the city.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.709
So what do you think, man?
He had to be staying somewhere, right?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.915
Yeah, like a friend's house.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.115
He could have been living here
his whole life.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.918
Maybe he just got off a bus
and got hit by that car.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.629
See, Charlie checked him out.
He had no driver's licence. No address.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.789
What are you gonna do
when you track him down?

07:52.880 --> 07:54.029
How's that gonna help you
find your mother?

07:54.120 --> 07:56.839
Well, I can see how he signed in.
Maybe there's a copy of his ID.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.638
- Go there. Find your mom.
- Yeah.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.676
Well, how do you even know Cardea's
his real name?

08:00.760 --> 08:03.672
What about that other thing? The hit?
The car crash from nowhere?

08:03.760 --> 08:09.118
Well, it was so dark. I don't know.
I saw a man's face and it was very quick.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.317
- You have no idea what that's about?
- I don't even know where it came from.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.915
Maybe your power's changing.
You know, maybe you're mutating.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.632
- Yeah, maybe I'm mutating.
- Yeah.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.234
No? Could be. A little bit.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.154
All right, okay, yeah, it's different.
The hits are taking on another level.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.754
- I don't know why.
- Man, you must be going crazy.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.592
Not that you're going crazy.
Just that you're going crazy.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.558
Can I have Frank Cardea's room, please?
C-A-R-D-E-A.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.711
You don't remember me, do you, Frank?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.228
I'm sorry?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.230
- Have you found him?
- Found him? Who?

09:01.320 --> 09:02.878
Excuse me.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.755
- Can I help you?
- I was just saying hello to Frank.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.434
- You two know each other?
- We go back a ways.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.637
Maybe you could help Toby,
the paramedic who brought Frank in.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.358
- I'm sorry?
- Toby Logan.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.112
He's been trying to get through to Frank.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.594
- Get through to him?
- Um... Yes.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.036
Frank's come in with some
severe head trauma.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.475
And he's had some trouble with his memory.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.632
- Stop it.
- What's the matter, Frank?

09:30.720 --> 09:32.199
Just stop now. Just...

09:32.880 --> 09:35.678
Do you know where I can get in touch
with this Toby Logan?

09:40.200 --> 09:41.189
Uh...

09:42.000 --> 09:43.752
I'm sorry, you are?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.192
I'm an old friend of Frank's.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.873
What's the matter, Frank?

09:50.040 --> 09:53.828
If I do run into him,
who shall I say is looking for him?

09:54.480 --> 09:57.233
That's okay. I'll come back later.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.152
- Who is he?
- He said he was a friend.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.800
- He said he knew me.
- Did you?

10:12.560 --> 10:13.879
I don't know.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.875
Frank,

10:18.880 --> 10:21.713
what's the matter? What are you thinking?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.111
- Toby knows.
- Toby knows what?

10:28.200 --> 10:32.352
- Toby knows what I'm thinking.
- Yeah, I bet he does.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.915
Toby's got a way of getting into your head.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.828
(SIGHING)

10:40.920 --> 10:42.990
You want the bad news or the bad news?

10:44.160 --> 10:47.357
- Do I have a choice?
- Oh, your words are so prophetic.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.113
Now, listen, after your boy called in
with his "medical emergency,"

10:50.200 --> 10:53.636
I called Lanois, I called Manuel, Hudson,
none of them can take the shift.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.199
What about Danko?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.874
She's at the dentist all morning.
And you know what that means?

10:59.040 --> 11:00.473
- Cavities?
- No, not cavities.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.553
It means you're riding with the Ryder.
You are lacing it up with a legend.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.392
Now, fire this bad boy up.
I'm gonna get my bag.

- Toby!

Hey, Liv.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.078
- Listen, I was checking up on Frank, earlier.
- Mmm-hmm. How's he doing?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.594
- He's okay, but he had a visitor.
- Oh, who?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.399
This really weird guy
who kept asking questions about you.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.675
Maybe it was just me,
but it was kind of creepy.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.988
Hey, Frank?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.797
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be out here.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.839
Oh. I'm just getting some air.
I wanna clear my head.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.629
Liv, do you think Frank and I
can go for a walk?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.430
Sure. Not for long.
And only if you're up for it.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.272
- All right.
- Okay.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.513
Frank, how you doing?
I hear you had a visitor today.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.036
- Oh, yeah, I've been trying to place him.
- Yeah, maybe an old friend?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.636
No, I don't think so.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.349
There's something about this guy.
I feel it in the pit of my stomach.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.714
Yeah, I'm sure it'll come to you.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.953
Do you remember anything new about Maya?
About my mother?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.911
Yeah... What do you remember?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.119
I remember...

12:08.840 --> 12:10.432
I remember her pulling me down a hallway.

12:11.440 --> 12:16.116
- Yeah. Well, we had to get out of there.
- Right. Get out of where, Frank?

12:17.200 --> 12:20.078
I can't... I took you to the trailer...

12:20.160 --> 12:22.913
- Yes, I remember the trailer.
- Yes, so you and your mother would be safe.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.194
But we weren't safe.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.039
Go. Hide.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.472
MAN: You don't look so good, Maya.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.793
Don't take my baby.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.112
- MAN: Where's the other one?
- He's gone.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.792
Who was after us, Frank?

12:42.880 --> 12:44.632
Who was after my mom and me?

12:49.120 --> 12:50.712
(CAR HORN BLARING)

12:50.800 --> 12:51.915
Toby! Toby!

12:54.920 --> 12:56.035
Toby!

12:56.120 --> 12:57.155
(EXCLAIMING)

12:57.240 --> 13:00.869
Toby! What is it? Come on, sit down.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.872
(PANTING)

13:04.640 --> 13:07.950
- I'm fine, Frank. I'm sorry.
- You sure?

13:09.720 --> 13:10.994
(EXHALING)

13:13.560 --> 13:17.189
- Excuse me, can I help you?
- I'm looking for Toby Logan.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.156
- I understand that he works out of here.
- Yeah, and you are?

13:21.640 --> 13:23.437
Victor Cluny.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.069
Well, I'm his boss.
You know, maybe I can help you.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.755
We need Mr Logan to provide us
with some confidential information

13:29.840 --> 13:32.479
- about a patient he picked up last week.
- Confidential?

13:32.560 --> 13:36.314
That sounds like some sort of case
for National Security or something.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.351
Well, maybe you would like
to talk to his partner.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.589
You know, they always ride together.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.194
We would prefer to speak
to Mr Logan personally.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.474
Well, I'll make sure to tell Mr Logan
that you were looking for him.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.195
You wouldn't happen to know
how we could get in touch with him?

13:53.280 --> 13:56.158
Well, seeing how we're so open
in sharing information, no.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.789
- Anything else?
- Yes, maybe I should speak to his partner.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.752
She's at the dentist right now.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.875
Oh.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.591
Thank you, Mr Ryder.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.469
Toby ever mention
a guy named Victor Cluny?

14:22.520 --> 14:23.873
Why?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.520
Just some guy was snooping around,
you know, asking a lot of questions.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.158
Just rubbed me the wrong way.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.113
- Is Toby in any trouble?
- No, sir. Not that I know of, sir.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.714
Why the hell are we still here?
Let's get going, man.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.028
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.752
RAY: How you doing, Frank?

14:42.760 --> 14:44.557
- I know you.
- Of course.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.432
We met earlier.
You said that you had read about me.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.794
About my work.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.519
Thought Toby might be someone
I'd be interested in.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.910
"When roses cease to bloom, dear
And violets are done

14:57.840 --> 15:01.799

Upon this summer's day"

"Will idle lie, in Auburn
Then take my flower, pray!"

15:17.200 --> 15:20.875
My mother, Frank? Where is she?
That's why you're here. Tell me where she is.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.670
- (SOFTLY) Think about it.
- I'm sorry.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.395
- I'm tired.
- RAY: Come on, Frank.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.878
Let's get you back to your room.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.714
- It's been a long day, Frank.
- Yes, thank you.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.314
You just rest. Take your time.
It'll come back to you.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.556
- Tell Toby I'm sorry I couldn't remember.
- I will, Frank. I will.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.077
RYDER: All right, so what have we got here?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.953
Oh, sir, don't touch him.
It could be electrocution.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.316
There's no way that's electrocution.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.868
Yeah, the best thing here
is to just wait it out.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.953
Yes, sir, these days we get
more Academy Award performances

16:25.040 --> 16:26.314
than the Academy Awards.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.197
- Yeah, good work.
- Thank you, sir.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.032
Yeah, but don't let that get to your head.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.588
That's what the good people of this city
pay you for.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.068
OZ: Hey, man, where are you?

16:38.160 --> 16:41.311
Hey, I'm at the university
waiting for Ray to finish a lecture.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.038
Yeah? What's going on with him?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.076
Well, we're gonna check out
my old case file,

16:45.160 --> 16:47.879
see if we can find something
that'll jog Frank's memory.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.439
What's going on with you?

16:49.520 --> 16:51.476
You ever hear of somebody
named Victor Cluny?

16:51.960 --> 16:52.949
No. Why?

16:53.040 --> 16:55.349
I don't know, some guy was
poking around here earlier asking about you.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.793
Shaved head, medium build?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.199
Yeah, how'd you know?

16:58.280 --> 17:00.271
Sounds like the same guy
that was hanging out in Frank's room.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.191
Huh. Sounds like somebody's
got their eye out for you.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.078
Yeah. Thanks, Oz.
How's it going with Ryder?

17:05.160 --> 17:07.310
Yeah, we're totally BFF's. I gotta text him.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.960
We're braiding each other's hair later.
Please come back. My life is hell.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.316
Nothing new there, though, huh?
I gotta go. Talk to you later.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.512
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.991
- Looks like just your file.
- What was in my file, Ray?

17:35.680 --> 17:38.353
Events. How we were controlling your gift.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.432
Distress beacons.
The latest incidents. Everything.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.273
Ray, all that information was
just sitting there in that filing cabinet?

17:44.360 --> 17:48.319
In a locked filing cabinet
in a locked room with a security guard.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.119
Somebody obviously knew
exactly what they were looking for.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.474
Yeah. Me.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.039
- Burglary is all over it.
- No, no, Charlie. It's not about burglary.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.758
This is about somebody coming after me.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.400
Both Oz and Olivia have told me
that a guy named Victor Cluny

18:05.480 --> 18:07.232
has been asking about me.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.470
- Okay.
- Ray's office gets broken into

18:09.560 --> 18:11.152
and my files are the only ones taken.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.912
And you think this Cluny guy's
gonna be all over you

18:13.000 --> 18:14.479
- unless I do something about it?
- Yes.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.791
CHARLIE: And I can't do anything about it
until he actually does something.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.711
That's reassuring, Charlie. That's reassuring.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.349
When you find me in a ditch,
don't forget that his name is Victor Cluny.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.238
Okay, Toby. All right. Look, I'll look him up,

18:26.320 --> 18:28.390
and if anything comes up, okay,

18:28.480 --> 18:30.232
if there's any dirt
under this guy's fingernails,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.390
- I promise you I will talk to him.
- Thank you.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.995
But in the meantime you might
just want to lay low till this all blows over.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.196
If you like, here is a key to my apartment.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.032
Anything you want to tell me?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.473
(SIGHING)

18:56.400 --> 18:58.436
Okay. So...

19:00.920 --> 19:02.751
Let me get this straight.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.951
You know what I'm thinking?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.515
- Yeah.
- Like right now?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.115
Mmm-hmm.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.235
OLIVIA: I don't know what to say.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.356
You don't have to say anything.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.389
All the time that I've known you, Toby,
all the things...

19:20.480 --> 19:22.311
All the things that I've kept from you,
you knew?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.515
Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.072
- Okay, yeah, I deserve that.
- Okay. No. No. Okay.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.349
(EXHALES)

19:31.360 --> 19:33.078
The things that I was thinking,
you have to know,

19:33.160 --> 19:35.355
they weren't necessarily
what I was thinking.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.319
Because there's over-thinking
and just wishful thinking...

19:40.640 --> 19:43.518
Liv, relax, okay? I love you.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.878
OLIVIA: Toby, you're gonna break me.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.757
Oh, you heard that, too?

19:47.840 --> 19:50.798
And I didn't want to tell you
'cause I didn't want to hurt you.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.029
- Can you just turn it off?
- Sometimes, yeah, I can.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.998
Like right now, when I don't wanna know
what you're thinking

20:04.080 --> 20:06.594
and I just hope
that we're thinking the same thing.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.715
Hmm.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.314
- Well, we weren't thinking the same thing.
- How do you know that?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.231
You weren't thinking
what I was thinking just now.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.118
- You sure about that?
- Mmm-hmm. I was thinking this...

20:15.200 --> 20:16.758
OZ: Ah!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.115
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, boys.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.873
- Frank. Toby.
- Mendoza.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.192
- Mendoza?
- I don't know.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.272
- He's been saying it over and over again.
- Yeah. Mendoza.

20:28.880 --> 20:33.237
- Maybe it's somebody you know, Toby?
- No. Mendoza.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.878
Wait a minute, Frank.
Is this the place that you've been staying?

20:39.280 --> 20:40.315
Yes!

21:05.040 --> 21:06.758
TOBY: Maybe there's something
with your address on it.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.559
- Maybe your luggage here, Frank.
- Yeah.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.675
TOBY: Maybe a tag?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.069
- No tag.
- How about a wallet?

21:19.560 --> 21:20.675
What's that, Frank?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.188
It's you and your mom.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.079
Can I see it?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.158
I will figure it out, Toby. We'll find her.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.599
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:45.640 --> 21:48.313
Hey, Charlie. Thank you
for calling me back. Yeah.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.709
We're at Casa Mendoza Motel.
Room 45.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.917
No, they're giving us a hard time.
They claim that Frank paid cash.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.797
Signed it with no address.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.272
Maybe you should come by,
show your badge, make it more official.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.992
Great. Thank you.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.672
She'll be here in 10 minutes.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.959
Frank, what happened?

22:09.040 --> 22:10.712
She knew they were coming for you.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.073
- She nearly killed me.
- No. She wasn't trying to hurt you.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.792
She was trying to save you.
I found you downstream.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.111
Toby! Please!

23:33.920 --> 23:36.195
- Toby Logan?
- Come on.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.669
Toby, I've been all over town
looking for you.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.352
Well, here I am. What do you want?

23:42.520 --> 23:45.159
I wanna take you home, to your mother.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.875
Maya, Frank had an accident.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.633
You're going to bring Toby back.
Bring my son home.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.879
I'll bring him back.

24:00.440 --> 24:05.036
- My mother sent you to find me.
- She wants you home.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.789
- I said that I'd help.
- No. Maya sent me.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.518
Yes, she did, Frank.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.953
But when she didn't hear from you
she got worried

24:12.040 --> 24:14.600
and that's when this whole thing
got mixed up.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.990
I'm not the bad guy here, Toby.
I wanna help you.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.877
There are other people out there
looking for you.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.953
- Oh, no. It's a lie. It's a lie.
- Frank, stop it.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.397
- You're confused.
- No, I...

24:26.480 --> 24:28.550
- Why would I lie, Frank?
- I don't know.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.869
Toby. Toby, I'm gonna call Maya.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.231
Look, you can talk to her yourself.

- Come.
- Here.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.073
No, no, wait.

There you go.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.398
Hi, it's Maya. I'm not home,
so please leave a message.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.632
- She sounds the same. It's her.
- That's right.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.157
She sounds exactly the same.

I gotta deal with her first.

to my mother's, were you?

- Where were you gonna take me?

- You are not a doctor. Let me do my job.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.953
Frank. Please.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.508
Get him into an examination room.
Stay with Frank.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.079
NURSE: Sir, please?

26:45.400 --> 26:46.799
This way.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.193
- Hell of a day, eh, Frank?
- (FRANK GRUNTING)

26:52.080 --> 26:54.514
He's the one we've been running from.

26:54.600 --> 26:58.593
- He's the one Maya had to get away from.
- It was him.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.472
- Where's the other one?
- He's gone.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.438
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I swear to you.

27:11.520 --> 27:15.149
Don't make this any more difficult
than it needs to be.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.112
(WHIMPERING)

27:17.880 --> 27:19.313
No!

27:19.400 --> 27:20.958
No, you can't take my baby!

27:21.160 --> 27:22.832
(BABY CRYING)

27:26.600 --> 27:29.831
- He's the one who took my brother.
- They wanted you, too.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.273
That's the reason we were running.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.679
Logan!

27:34.000 --> 27:35.115
Hey.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.315
What the hell happened out there?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.436
See, I gave the officer on the scene
a full report.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.556
Right. Who's Victor Cluny?

27:40.640 --> 27:43.518
You probably know more about him
than I do.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.272
What was Marks doing at that motel?

27:45.360 --> 27:47.430
- She was protecting us.
- She was protecting you?

27:47.520 --> 27:48.509
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's great.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.999
You got your own
private security guard now.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.633
That guy was after me and she...

27:51.720 --> 27:55.190
- You threw her in front of a bus!
- What are you talking about?

27:55.280 --> 27:58.238
Marks opened up the doors
to my department to you

27:58.320 --> 28:01.312
- and look where it got her.
- You got the wrong idea about me.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.755
What I got is my own agenda
and you're on it.

28:03.840 --> 28:07.753
You set one foot inside my department,
I swear to God...

28:07.840 --> 28:09.558
BECKER: I'll snap your scrawny little neck.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.153
- She's out of surgery.
- And?

28:29.680 --> 28:31.398
She's critical but stable.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.152
- How's Frank?
- He's fine. Irascible.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.673
He just wants to get out of here.

28:37.960 --> 28:41.669
Liv, I'm sorry that
you're bothered by all of this.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.513
You have absolutely nothing
to be sorry about.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.160
I will take you to Charlie
and then you have to promise to go home

28:48.240 --> 28:49.673
- and get some rest.
- All right.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.079
- Doctor's orders.
- Thank you.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.589
I remember when I first met you.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.750
And I asked you to help me and you did.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.791
I run around and I pry into people's heads

29:42.880 --> 29:46.156
and I think that I'm gonna help them,
that I'm gonna fix things.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.791
It made me feel like I had purpose,

29:52.520 --> 29:55.034
a reason to be like this,

29:56.120 --> 30:00.079
that it could be helpful to people,
that I could be of a benefit.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.718
You trust me.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.319
That means a lot to me.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.838
I don't need you to forgive me
for dragging you into this.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.272
I just need you to get better.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.111
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

30:37.280 --> 30:40.033
- Hey, Ray, thanks for coming.
- How's she doing?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.113
They're discharging Frank.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.668
Yes, I heard. I'm gonna take him
to my place.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.035
With Cluny still out there,
is that a good idea?

30:48.120 --> 30:49.917
You're right. Um...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.275
Maybe I'll grab my bags
and we'll find a hotel.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.118
I've been thinking, Ray,
what if this is all connected?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.513
- What do you mean?
- What if it's my mother driving that car?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.477
Doesn't that make sense?

31:01.920 --> 31:04.878
She hasn't heard from Frank,
so she goes to find him herself

31:04.960 --> 31:08.157
- and Cluny stops her.
- It's over, Toby.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.879
No. Something's not right.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.676
She's desperate. She's coming by herself.

31:13.760 --> 31:17.469
If it's her in the car,
what if these are her distress beacons?

31:17.560 --> 31:19.198
What if she needs help?

31:19.280 --> 31:22.750
Even if there is a chance I'm right,
I have to find her.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.511
Frank, I'm just going to grab a bag here.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.229
- I was supposed to call her.
- What?

31:51.320 --> 31:53.595
- I was supposed to call Maya.
- All right, that's good.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.352
Just think back a little bit, okay?

31:55.440 --> 31:58.000
- Think back a little bit before then. All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.998
"Will idle lie, in Auburn
Then take my flower, pray!"

32:03.080 --> 32:04.069
I know you.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.912
That's good. Okay. It's good. It's good.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.718
All right, you got here somehow. All right?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.756
You don't have a driver's licence,
so you couldn't drive.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.673
- No, no. Didn't drive.
- How did you get here?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.199
- Were you on a bus?
- I was.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.397
- All right, where did you come from?
- (STAMMERING) Well...

32:21.480 --> 32:24.916
It's okay. Okay, how long was the ride?
Can you think about that, Frank?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.591
That's good, think about the sign.
Think about the sign.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.954
The sign. Where was I?

32:30.040 --> 32:31.473
The sign.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.035
- Right.
- The sign. The bridge! The bridge!

32:34.120 --> 32:35.348
- Yes.
- Yeah.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.275
(COCKS GUN)

32:38.360 --> 32:40.476
You didn't think that we were gonna stop,
did you?

32:40.560 --> 32:43.677
Stand back, old man.
You are coming with me.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.032
You're not going to shoot me.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.557
- You didn't come here to kill me.
- No, you're right.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.754
- But I will put a bullet in his brain.
- I'm not gonna let you take him.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.239
- In five...
- You can't take him.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.788
...four, three...
- All right. Okay.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.715
Let Frank go.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.033
I'll come with you. I'll come with you.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.793
Leave Frank alone, and I'll come with you.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.193
Back off.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.197
I'm taking you where you belong.

33:17.720 --> 33:21.349
- Toby, get out of here. Run.
- I'm not running, Frank.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.752
Toby's right. He's not gonna run any more.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.959
Nobody is.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.917
And you're not gonna stop, are you?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.115
(LAUGHING)

33:32.200 --> 33:33.792
Give me the gun, Frank.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.873
How long are the police
going to keep Frank?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.598
- I don't know.
- And you can't get near him?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.989
Becker's got me banned
from even driving by the police station.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.197
- Maybe I can get to him.
- He's not gonna let anyone talk to him, Oz.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.759
- So what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.478
Cluny didn't make it.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.598
- Toby...
- What am I supposed to do?

34:06.680 --> 34:09.399
All right? That's the only guy
who knew where my mother was.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.358
I got a feeling he's gonna need
the both of us.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.634
Yeah.

34:17.159 --> 34:21.597
FRANK: "When roses cease to bloom, dear
And violets are done

34:22.040 --> 34:24.429
"Will idle lie, in Auburn

34:26.000 --> 34:28.150
"Then take my flower, pray!"

34:29.639 --> 34:33.155
All right, guys. Frank came here
to take me home, right?

34:33.239 --> 34:35.117
- What's orthography?
- I don't know.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.428
Well, he underlined it in here.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.080
"Weeds triumphant ranged
Strangers strolled and spelled

34:39.159 --> 34:41.469
"At the Ione orthography
Of the elder dead"

34:41.560 --> 34:43.835
- It's the study of spelling.
- Really?

34:45.120 --> 34:47.270
- Orthography. You guys didn't know that?
- No.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.119
Let me see this.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.634
All right, Frank treated this like a bible.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.597
Why did he underline that word?

34:55.679 --> 34:57.636
Maybe he's underlining words
he doesn't know.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.154
- OZ: I do that.
- No, look at this. Here's another one.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.276
"The hand that paused to gather
Upon this summer's day

35:02.360 --> 35:05.272
"Will idle lie, in Auburn
Then take my flower, pray!"

35:05.360 --> 35:06.998
"Auburn." He underlined "Auburn."

35:07.080 --> 35:08.718
Then there's "violet."

35:10.080 --> 35:11.957
- And there's another "violet."
- They're both colours.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.029
Mmm-hmm.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.835
- You think he's trying to tell us something.
- No, I don't.

35:16.920 --> 35:20.879
He came here for a reason
and he forgot what that was.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.952
And maybe this is his way
of trying to remember why he's here.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.393
I don't know.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.680
- OLIVIA: What are you doing?
- Just checking something here.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.554
(STAMMERS) Auburn is a town west of here.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.711
Yeah, town of Auburn?
Can you maybe try first name Maya?

35:44.200 --> 35:45.792
M-A-Y-A.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.556
Violet's a name. Could be a street.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.278
On Violet Street maybe.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.149
Oh, really? Yeah?

36:12.200 --> 36:13.952
OZ: Yeah. Nothing?

36:14.680 --> 36:16.113
- All right, thank you.
- Any luck?

36:16.600 --> 36:19.160
Local hospitals haven't admitted
any accident victims in a week.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.912
- I take it she's not there?
- The house is all locked up.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.753
Guy across the street says
no one's been home in days.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.833
(SIGHING)

36:26.720 --> 36:28.836
- What's the matter, Toby?
- Well, she's still out there.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.309
- Stuck in her car.
- Mmm-hmm. We gotta find her.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.909
(CRASHING)

36:54.000 --> 36:56.753
Hey, this is it. This is it. Stop the car!
Hey, Oz, stop!

36:56.840 --> 36:57.909
- All right.
- Gotta back up.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.989
What is it?

37:16.840 --> 37:17.909
Mom!

37:22.520 --> 37:24.238
Mom! Mom!

37:27.600 --> 37:29.431
Hey, Oz, call it in!

37:38.600 --> 37:40.750
Police. Ambulance. We're on a bridge
just outside of Auburn.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.592
There's a car. It's buried under snow.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.317
No, we don't know about survivors.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.992
(PANTING)

37:51.120 --> 37:52.633
