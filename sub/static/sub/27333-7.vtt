00:07.974 --> 00:09.853
CHASE:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.937 --> 00:12.399
JONAH: Everything I've worked towards,
everything I've done, was for this.

00:12.483 --> 00:15.322
Karolina, I'd like to introduce you
to your brother.

00:15.405 --> 00:17.536
Are you really gonna let me die?

00:18.996 --> 00:20.708
I loved Jonah.

00:20.792 --> 00:23.506
But then I discovered
what he is truly capable of.

00:23.589 --> 00:26.427
JONAH: You think I chose you
because I enjoy your company?

00:27.221 --> 00:30.895
I chose you because of your capability
to perform a specific task,

00:30.979 --> 00:33.693
so I can get my ship
out of that damn hole

00:33.776 --> 00:35.780
and get the hell out of here!

00:35.863 --> 00:38.201
The day after tomorrow, all of you
are gonna show up at the dig site.

00:38.285 --> 00:39.788
And if we don't go along with it?

00:39.871 --> 00:42.586
I'll kill your children.
You know I wouldn't hesitate.

00:42.669 --> 00:44.297
DALE:
Inject it with the serum...

00:44.380 --> 00:47.344
Whatever the serum does to this thing,
it'll also do to Jonah.

00:47.428 --> 00:49.307
It's turning black!

00:49.390 --> 00:50.475
Necrosis! Yes!

00:50.560 --> 00:52.772
NEWSWOMAN:
...Darius Davis is also responsible

00:52.856 --> 00:54.901
for the murder
of Destiny Gonzalez.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.989
This was all my parents.
I know it.

00:57.072 --> 00:59.578
-[loud clanking]
-Now, Molly.

01:02.082 --> 01:03.753
ALEX:
Holy shit. Dad!

01:03.836 --> 01:06.174
I make the rules.
You're under my roof now.

01:06.257 --> 01:08.219
The meeting with Jonah--
he showed me

01:08.303 --> 01:09.347
what was at the bottom of that hole.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.769
-My family.
-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

01:11.852 --> 01:13.313
Because there's something else.

01:13.396 --> 01:15.317
Jonah, he killed Amy.

01:17.572 --> 01:19.492
JONAH:
Isn't this what you want?

01:21.830 --> 01:23.876
What you've always wanted?

01:26.047 --> 01:28.093
To be free?

01:28.176 --> 01:30.055
Free from fear?

01:31.517 --> 01:33.771
Death is not the end...

01:35.315 --> 01:37.111
it's simply a door.

01:38.739 --> 01:43.373
Let go of everything that binds you
to this broken and failing darkness.

01:43.456 --> 01:44.793
[no audio]

01:44.876 --> 01:46.964
There is nothing left for you here.

01:51.222 --> 01:54.395
You were here on the first day,
and you will be here on the last;

01:54.478 --> 01:57.944
you are always already;
without beginning or end;

01:58.027 --> 02:00.198
one with the universe;

02:00.282 --> 02:02.662
endless and eternal..

02:04.081 --> 02:07.379
ever with us,
and us ever with you.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.429
This is true.

02:12.557 --> 02:14.059
[David wheezing]

02:14.143 --> 02:17.441
Have no fear, Brother David.

02:19.069 --> 02:20.531
A new form awaits.

02:25.207 --> 02:27.211
May you journey in brightness.

02:40.237 --> 02:41.657
LESLIE: No...

02:48.044 --> 02:50.675
-[crying]
-I'm so very sorry.

02:52.595 --> 02:54.933
Thank you for coming.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.689
You always seem to be around
at just the right time.

02:58.691 --> 03:01.279
Your father and your mother,
they've been like family to me.

03:02.907 --> 03:05.538
I...wish she was here.

03:06.748 --> 03:08.878
Your mother's a complicated woman.

03:10.422 --> 03:12.969
Shouldn't we tell her what happened?

03:13.052 --> 03:14.973
They need her.

03:15.725 --> 03:17.729
She's been banished.

03:17.812 --> 03:19.398
She wants no part of the Church.

03:19.481 --> 03:21.277
And when she rejected it,
she rejected you.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.331
[sighs]

03:29.669 --> 03:31.757
I'll try to get word to her.

03:33.092 --> 03:36.474
But there's no need...
to grieve over what's past.

03:38.436 --> 03:40.775
You need to focus on the future.

03:42.695 --> 03:44.574
-OK.
-JONAH: Good.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.664
I told your father I'd protect you,
no matter what.

03:48.874 --> 03:51.045
-You did?
-JONAH: I did.

03:51.128 --> 03:53.676
Made him feel as if he could leave,
and that...

03:53.759 --> 03:55.178
you would always be safe.

03:57.432 --> 04:01.817
You and I, Leslie...
we have a destiny together.

04:03.696 --> 04:04.989
Are you ready?

04:05.991 --> 04:07.912
I am.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.127
Sacrifices will have to be made.

04:13.924 --> 04:15.427
I'm willing.

04:33.547 --> 04:35.885
I do hope you'll always feel that way.

05:08.282 --> 05:10.370
[theme music playing]

06:19.341 --> 06:21.178
[birds chirping]

06:31.490 --> 06:32.576
Hungry?

06:33.244 --> 06:36.041
You gonna feed me by hand,
or take me out of this jacket?

06:37.377 --> 06:39.590
Yeah, I don't like
any of those choices.

06:40.258 --> 06:42.095
Maybe I'll just keep it for myself.

06:44.559 --> 06:48.817
I don't have much of an appetite
anyway. My head is pounding.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.030
Yeah, Jonah put you in
one of those boxes.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.783
Not usually good
for somebody's health.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.871
Neither is this right here.

06:54.954 --> 06:57.710
I'm talkin' about your health,
not mine.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.173
You don't know what
you've gotten yourself into, son.

07:00.256 --> 07:02.260
You need to walk away
and leave it to us.

07:02.343 --> 07:04.431
Yes, so you can handle it
like you handled Darius?

07:09.066 --> 07:12.405
That...wasn't the plan.

07:14.952 --> 07:17.666
Sometimes you trust someone
to do the right thing,

07:17.750 --> 07:20.714
and they...just don't.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.433
As for your crew,
the hacking computer stolen from Atlas

07:26.518 --> 07:27.895
in the middle of the day,

07:27.978 --> 07:30.567
a kid flipping a truck
at the dig site--

07:30.651 --> 07:33.782
That wasn't us, all right?
At least...not technically.

07:33.865 --> 07:36.286
My point is, that shit was messy.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.253
Alex, you--

07:40.336 --> 07:42.591
Since you were little,
I could always tell

07:42.675 --> 07:44.261
when you were wingin' it.

07:44.344 --> 07:46.891
Improvising because you thought
you'd be smart enough when the time came.

07:46.975 --> 07:49.062
Well, this isn't a world history exam.

07:49.146 --> 07:50.816
Just like you to underestimate me.

07:50.899 --> 07:52.945
You can't go up against Jonah.
He will kill you!

07:53.028 --> 07:54.406
Like you killed fifteen runaways?

07:54.489 --> 07:55.868
GEOFFREY:
Cut the bullshit, Alex.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.705
We can rehash the past
some other time.

07:57.788 --> 07:58.874
I'm trying to keep you alive.

07:58.957 --> 08:00.669
-Well, I don't need your help for that.
-GEOFFREY: Really?

08:00.752 --> 08:04.384
OK, 'cause it seems to me you're missing
some critical information.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.888
Like what?

08:05.971 --> 08:08.852
Do you know when
he's gonna be there? Hmm?

08:08.935 --> 08:10.689
Who he's bringing?

08:10.772 --> 08:12.108
Of course not.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.325
Do you even know what's
at the bottom of that hole?

08:16.408 --> 08:19.206
The thing that Jonah
is willing to kill for?

08:21.418 --> 08:22.671
CHASE:
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:22.755 --> 08:25.886
He's saying the Death Star
is buried underground?

08:25.969 --> 08:27.681
The Death Star
is an orbital battle station,

08:27.765 --> 08:30.812
but I'll give you credit for trying.
Yeah. That's exactly what he's saying.

08:30.896 --> 08:33.067
Spaceship in Compton.
That's kinda boss.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.614
No, this can't be real. This has gotta be
another of our parents' tricks.

08:35.697 --> 08:38.452
His dad is telling the truth.
There is a ship down there.

08:38.535 --> 08:39.830
ALEX:
How do you know?

08:41.082 --> 08:43.462
She doesn't. I do.

08:44.674 --> 08:47.680
-I've seen it.
-How?

08:47.763 --> 08:50.769
I've...been down there...

08:50.852 --> 08:52.606
with Jonah.

08:57.908 --> 09:00.622
You better talk fast, because
I'm about to get really pissed.

09:04.672 --> 09:06.174
He's my father.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.349
I guess I saw that coming.

09:10.433 --> 09:13.105
The family that glows together,
grows together, right?

09:13.188 --> 09:15.192
And we thought our parents
were the messed-up ones.

09:15.276 --> 09:17.363
He's been teaching me.
Explaining everything.

09:17.447 --> 09:19.702
Including the part where we all die
in a catastrophic earthquake?

09:19.785 --> 09:21.079
That's not going to happen.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.167
Molly's parents didn't understand
how his ship worked.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.839
Their calculations were based
on our technology, not his.

09:25.922 --> 09:28.218
Are you saying that
my parents were stupid?

09:28.302 --> 09:30.473
And that they died for nothing?

09:30.557 --> 09:31.893
No, not at all, Molly.

09:31.976 --> 09:34.022
I'm just saying that there are things
about him they couldn't have known.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.401
-And you trust him?
-Yes.

09:37.613 --> 09:39.282
No.

09:39.366 --> 09:41.286
Maybe. He let us escape
from the church that day,

09:41.370 --> 09:43.541
and he showed me things
that are wonderful.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.088
And now he just wants to leave.
That's all he's ever wanted.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.800
Wait. He's leaving?

09:49.553 --> 09:52.810
How can you be so sure
he plans on not taking you with him?

09:53.687 --> 09:55.439
He hasn't asked me to go, so...

09:55.524 --> 09:57.026
Just think about it.

09:57.110 --> 09:59.657
Is there a possibility that
he takes you onto that ship

09:59.740 --> 10:01.284
and then leaves the rest of us behind
to die?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.788
-He wouldn't do that.
-I'm gonna go with

10:02.871 --> 10:04.165
-"I'm pretty sure he would."
-I would know.

10:04.249 --> 10:07.715
We're connected in this weird way
on a deeper level.

10:08.550 --> 10:09.844
And that's why
you're staying behind today.

10:09.927 --> 10:11.681
CHASE:
Of course, you would say that.

10:11.764 --> 10:13.893
I mean, leaving Karolina behind
is kind of your thing.

10:15.479 --> 10:16.941
NICO: No.

10:19.822 --> 10:23.036
-No, Alex is right.
-What?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.128
You betrayed us.

10:28.297 --> 10:29.340
All of us.

10:30.259 --> 10:33.432
Sneaking out?
Lying about where you were going?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.645
With one of them.

10:35.729 --> 10:38.985
Yeah, but Karolina's the only reason
why we got out alive last night.

10:39.068 --> 10:41.448
Leaving her here
probably isn't the best plan.

10:42.408 --> 10:45.289
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

10:46.584 --> 10:48.337
ALEX: Me too.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.719
So pack your gear. We leave now.
We're gonna destroy that hole.

11:05.789 --> 11:07.835
[chatter]

11:12.719 --> 11:14.890
-WOMAN: Can I help you?
-I'm here to see PRIDE.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.644
They're in a meeting right now.

11:17.436 --> 11:19.315
I'm the one they're meeting about.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.620
You lookin' for me?

11:27.415 --> 11:30.797
Sorry I checked out of Digi-delphia
without leaving a note.

11:33.343 --> 11:37.059
Janet, I understand how much
you missed your husband.

11:37.143 --> 11:39.690
But with the launch tonight,
you took an unnecessary risk

11:39.773 --> 11:42.571
releasing Victor so hastily
from his healing algorithm.

11:42.654 --> 11:46.411
Another one of your lies.
He was healed. Had been for a while.

11:46.494 --> 11:48.583
And the last time you saw him
he was dead.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.338
I'd say, in the scheme of things,
his time with me was well spent.

11:53.927 --> 11:56.222
It's nice to have you back.
You look well.

11:56.306 --> 11:58.101
STACEY:
And you're looking better.

11:59.145 --> 12:00.565
There's only one way
that can happen.

12:00.649 --> 12:02.653
Where are the Wilders?

12:05.157 --> 12:07.913
Good morning, Ms. Wilder.
Will Mr. Wilder be joining you as well?

12:07.996 --> 12:10.209
That's what I'm trying
to find the hell out.

12:11.336 --> 12:12.463
JONAH:
I assure you,

12:12.547 --> 12:16.388
everything I've done is to achieve
our common goal: my departure.

12:16.471 --> 12:17.641
CATHERINE:
You're not going anywhere.

12:17.724 --> 12:19.352
Not until you tell me
what you have done with Geoffrey.

12:19.435 --> 12:22.108
I've talked to Flores,
I've combed every hospital--he's gone.

12:22.191 --> 12:24.028
The only person that can
make that happen is you.

12:24.112 --> 12:25.699
My God, you've killed him.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.243
JONAH: Again,
you've overlooked the obvious.

12:27.326 --> 12:29.038
Your kids have him.

12:29.122 --> 12:30.457
-TINA: Our kids?
-Mm-hm.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.796
-How do you know that?
-How would they do that?

12:32.879 --> 12:34.550
And why should we believe
a word you have to say?

12:34.633 --> 12:36.971
Because I tried to kill him.

12:37.054 --> 12:39.308
Wanted to. Desperately.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.479
Your husband's strength and stamina

12:41.564 --> 12:43.526
would have been most helpful.

12:43.609 --> 12:45.739
Who wouldn't want Geoffrey Wilder
inside of them?

12:45.822 --> 12:46.866
Don't think that's what he meant.

12:46.949 --> 12:50.414
JONAH:
But your children rescued him.

12:50.497 --> 12:53.588
For some reason,
with all evidence to the contrary,

12:53.671 --> 12:55.424
they still think you're worth
keeping alive.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.635
CATHERINE:
The question is, are you?

12:56.719 --> 12:58.681
Are we just gonna stand for this?

12:58.765 --> 13:00.894
He just admitted he has no problem
killing one of us.

13:00.977 --> 13:03.398
Um, I think that was well established
ten years ago

13:03.482 --> 13:04.777
when a certain lab blew up.

13:04.860 --> 13:08.408
Your credibility is razor-thin,
Jonah.

13:08.492 --> 13:11.372
Convince us you're leaving tonight
and that no one will get hurt.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.628
You're talking about this earthquake
business again, aren't you?

13:13.711 --> 13:16.132
How many times do I have to assure you?

13:16.216 --> 13:18.011
Apparently one more. OK.

13:18.095 --> 13:21.644
So let me explain this to you in a way
that you, um, hopefully understand.

13:21.727 --> 13:25.610
We all love your children so very much.
I'm sure you remember their births.

13:25.693 --> 13:29.117
-Dale doesn't.
-Seriously, Stace? Here?

13:29.993 --> 13:31.789
He had a panic attack
in the delivery room

13:31.872 --> 13:33.751
and administered himself
my epidural.

13:33.835 --> 13:37.634
And a beautiful baby girl was born.
One of life's miracles.

13:38.426 --> 13:41.934
My ship is organic,
capable of changing shape.

13:42.894 --> 13:45.357
It will squeeze through
the opening that we created

13:45.440 --> 13:47.946
like a baby traveling down
the birth canal.

13:48.029 --> 13:50.910
And, as long as nobody panics...

13:53.039 --> 13:55.168
another miracle will occur.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.630
I'll be on my way home.

13:57.549 --> 13:59.887
And you'll be going alone?

14:00.722 --> 14:02.224
Hm.

14:02.308 --> 14:03.686
[laughs]

14:03.769 --> 14:05.397
[clears throat]

14:08.779 --> 14:11.034
I put this team together,

14:11.117 --> 14:14.081
financed you,
made your wildest dreams come true.

14:15.292 --> 14:16.545
[Jonah sighs]

14:19.216 --> 14:20.511
I'll see you all tonight.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.481
VICTOR:
Didn't exactly answer your question.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.401
No.

14:28.485 --> 14:29.988
No, he didn't.

14:33.078 --> 14:35.290
Where'd you get all the books?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.129
There's a whole box of them downstairs.

14:38.213 --> 14:41.135
I organized them, based on
mold contamination.

14:41.219 --> 14:43.849
There's run-of-the-mill mildew
on top,

14:43.933 --> 14:46.814
water damage and warping
near the bottom.

14:46.897 --> 14:48.985
Any truly toxic fungus
I just kept in the box.

14:49.068 --> 14:51.322
Except for "Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"

14:51.406 --> 14:53.869
because I will read Didion
even if it kills me.

14:53.953 --> 14:55.497
[sniffles] Oh.

14:55.581 --> 14:57.627
[coughs] Which it may.

14:57.711 --> 15:00.591
Well, it seems like you've adjusted
really well to Chase moving out.

15:01.802 --> 15:03.514
Glad it appears that way.

15:05.727 --> 15:08.440
Though I'm pretty sure you didn't
come in here to talk to me

15:08.524 --> 15:09.818
about my relationship,

15:09.901 --> 15:12.281
or seminal published works
on female self-respect.

15:13.659 --> 15:15.078
I need your help.

15:15.162 --> 15:17.332
Nobody trusts me,
but they'll listen to you.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.047
Why should I...listen to you?

15:20.130 --> 15:22.217
Because no one I know
is more passionate

15:22.301 --> 15:24.096
about helping those
who can't help themselves.

15:26.309 --> 15:29.315
I have always had a soft spot
for the disenfranchised.

15:30.568 --> 15:32.655
I'm listening.

15:32.739 --> 15:35.536
-We are so not doing your plan.
-We're totally doing our plan.

15:35.620 --> 15:36.747
-ALEX: No.
-Yes.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.293
The risk is too great.
We already worked this out.

15:39.376 --> 15:41.380
I destroy the infrastructure
with my computer,

15:41.464 --> 15:43.886
and you guys bury the ship
so that it can't get out, ever.

15:43.969 --> 15:45.973
-It's done.
- There's a moral imperative here now.

15:46.057 --> 15:47.560
There are lives
at the bottom of that hole.

15:47.644 --> 15:50.608
Who could be more versions of Jonah.
Why would we help them?

15:50.691 --> 15:52.486
Could be more versions of her.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.240
If you bury them, you bury me.

15:55.993 --> 15:58.039
-That's not fair.
-I've touched them.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.962
They're alive like we're alive,
and they're suffering. Dying.

16:02.339 --> 16:04.051
GERT:
We can't think of the creatures as "them."

16:04.135 --> 16:06.222
That's the same thinking
that led our parents

16:06.305 --> 16:08.143
to put teenagers in a murder box.

16:08.226 --> 16:10.898
NICO: And we swore we weren't
going to be like those assholes.

16:13.361 --> 16:16.200
-How long have you been standing there?
-Long enough.

16:17.579 --> 16:19.165
I'm with them.

16:21.460 --> 16:24.091
I guess this just turned
into a rescue mission.

16:29.853 --> 16:32.357
Jonah thinks he's picking me up
from our spot. He's headed there now.

16:32.441 --> 16:35.865
OK, tell him you're running late
and to wait for you.

16:35.948 --> 16:38.161
That should keep him busy
long enough for us to do our jobs.

16:38.244 --> 16:40.332
-Which seem to be changing.
-Evolving.

16:40.415 --> 16:41.960
Into something inclusive
and enlightened.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.423
And dangerous.
We gotta go inside now.

16:44.507 --> 16:45.843
Which means we need a better plan.

16:45.927 --> 16:48.056
Luckily, that's your area
of expertise.

16:48.139 --> 16:51.605
True, but with this much at stake,
there's no margin for error,

16:51.688 --> 16:54.986
so I reached out to someone
with more experience.

16:55.070 --> 16:57.659
But we have to keep our objective
to ourselves.

16:57.742 --> 16:59.955
If he knows what we're doing,
he won't go along with it.

17:01.415 --> 17:02.669
Follow me.

17:13.523 --> 17:16.112
-You can't be serious.
-We have a common enemy.

17:16.194 --> 17:19.492
He knows everything about the site,
and more about Jonah than any of us.

17:19.577 --> 17:23.251
-But he's on their side.
-We have to let that go for now.

17:23.334 --> 17:27.050
-I want to keep you alive.
-Something else we share.

17:27.134 --> 17:31.267
Look, whatever you intend to do,
we gotta get there ahead of PRIDE.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.187
-So we need to move.
-Which means we need a blindfold.

17:33.271 --> 17:35.275
-A what?
-CHASE: Secret hideouts

17:35.358 --> 17:36.945
need to stay secret.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.870
No offense, Mr. Wilder.

17:44.418 --> 17:45.713
Whew.

17:45.796 --> 17:48.092
CHASE [on video]:
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

17:48.176 --> 17:50.096
I'm sorry for all of it.

17:51.098 --> 17:54.146
And please, whatever you do, Dad,

17:54.229 --> 17:57.027
don't pick up the Fistigons.

17:58.112 --> 18:00.075
Dad?

18:00.158 --> 18:01.870
- Dad, are you there?
-JANET: Victor?

18:01.953 --> 18:04.584
-I hope you get this in time.
-What's going on?

18:04.668 --> 18:07.507
-I know it's a long shot...
-It's him.

18:07.590 --> 18:10.930
-From the future.
-I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

18:11.013 --> 18:14.478
-He's broadcasting a warning.
-I'm sorry for all of it.

18:14.562 --> 18:18.194
-That's Chase.
-The time machine works.

18:18.277 --> 18:20.407
-[Chase continues]
-Victor, that's incredible.

18:20.490 --> 18:24.415
Every once in a while I'm reminded
that I married a mad scientist.

18:24.498 --> 18:26.712
-Listen to what he says.
-Dad, are you there?

18:26.795 --> 18:29.718
I hope you get this in time.
I know it's a longshot...

18:29.801 --> 18:32.347
He didn't want it to happen.

18:32.431 --> 18:35.688
[sniffles] He's trying to save me.
To keep all of this from happening.

18:35.771 --> 18:39.194
-So he could have another chance with you.
-Yeah.

18:39.278 --> 18:43.829
And...since he's there, then,
sending this to us now, that...

18:45.457 --> 18:47.169
that means it's all gonna work out.

18:48.254 --> 18:50.175
We're gonna be a family again.

18:51.845 --> 18:53.347
[turns off video]

18:54.433 --> 18:55.686
I want to believe you, Victor,

18:55.770 --> 18:59.067
but right now thinking about the future
feels like a luxury.

19:00.278 --> 19:02.032
I'm afraid of what's gonna happen tonight.

19:02.115 --> 19:03.326
Oh, no. Don't be.

19:04.369 --> 19:07.919
That's why we're bringing your project
for insurance.

19:08.002 --> 19:09.881
All right?
[laughs]

19:09.964 --> 19:12.427
If Jonah tries to trick us,

19:12.512 --> 19:15.643
or if anything goes sideways,
we have this.

19:15.726 --> 19:17.688
Are you sure it'll work?

19:18.607 --> 19:21.988
-We didn't have any time to--
-Your design was magnificent.

19:22.072 --> 19:27.249
I may have made a couple alterations,
but yes.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.796
If we can get close enough,

19:29.879 --> 19:32.050
we should be able
to shut down the engine.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.429
-And if we do that...
-There's no escape.

19:34.514 --> 19:35.599
Yeah.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.522
And unfortunately,

19:38.605 --> 19:40.609
we're stuck with Jonah forever.

19:40.693 --> 19:42.613
Not if Dale and Stacey do their part.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.453
-STACEY: This is a terrible idea.
-DALE: What do you mean?

19:46.538 --> 19:48.584
Who brings poison
to a bon voyage party?

19:48.667 --> 19:51.506
The same guy who poured Everclear
into the punchbowl

19:51.590 --> 19:53.342
at the Bioformatics holiday party.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.596
You didn't seem to
have a problem with that.

19:54.679 --> 19:56.223
Yeah, because nobody's life
was at stake.

19:56.307 --> 19:58.604
That is a matter of opinion.

19:58.687 --> 20:00.524
Oh God, I just want him to go away.

20:00.608 --> 20:03.739
And maybe he will.
And if so, big celebration.

20:03.822 --> 20:07.370
Cake, balloons, a Jonah piñata
for candy and catharsis, right?

20:08.540 --> 20:12.130
But if he has one final trick
up his scaly sleeve,

20:12.213 --> 20:15.428
I feel one tremor, or he tries
to hurt someone I care about...

20:18.727 --> 20:20.438
I'm gonna drop him.

20:20.522 --> 20:22.400
Have a blessed day.

20:22.484 --> 20:24.237
Journey in brightness.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.333
FRANK:
The event is tonight?

20:30.416 --> 20:32.588
Your father called it The Ascension.
This is incredible.

20:32.672 --> 20:34.717
No, Frank, it's not incredible.
It's terrible.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.930
And it's not an ascension,
it's a launch--

20:37.013 --> 20:39.017
of Jonah's spaceship.

20:39.101 --> 20:41.690
Yeah, you heard me. We have
no idea what's gonna happen.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.944
-We need to make sure we're there.
-Absolutely.

20:44.027 --> 20:45.990
I wouldn't miss it.
If it's what David promised--

20:46.073 --> 20:48.829
Frank! All of that is bullshit.

20:49.371 --> 20:51.584
Fed to my father by Jonah.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.884
Look, the rest of PRIDE is worried
that their kids might get hurt tonight--

20:55.968 --> 20:59.016
I'm worried that ours might leave.
With him.

20:59.099 --> 21:01.437
You need to trust Karolina
more than that.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.692
It's not Karolina I'm worried about.

21:04.401 --> 21:07.407
Well...I guess this is goodbye.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.038
What do you mean?

21:11.875 --> 21:13.419
I'm coming with you tonight.

21:14.212 --> 21:16.216
You've already done so much.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.387
Besides, the troops
have been marshaled.

21:18.471 --> 21:20.893
They're gonna make sure
that nothing goes wrong tonight.

21:20.976 --> 21:22.062
AURA:
Journey into...

21:22.145 --> 21:23.607
Jonah...

21:25.068 --> 21:26.863
I've devoted my whole life to this.

21:28.157 --> 21:29.660
The Ascension.

21:31.163 --> 21:33.668
It's a holy moment for all of us.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.964
And if we're to lead the church forward,

21:36.048 --> 21:38.385
it's important that
we witness this firsthand.

21:40.891 --> 21:44.439
Well, after recent events, I...

21:44.524 --> 21:46.151
wasn't sure of your sentiments.

21:47.445 --> 21:48.990
But very well.

21:49.867 --> 21:51.955
Frank...

21:52.038 --> 21:53.667
can I leave you to finish this?

21:53.750 --> 21:54.919
Absolutely.

21:56.463 --> 21:57.550
JONAH: Good.

22:08.237 --> 22:09.782
Hey, Mr. Dean, right?

22:09.866 --> 22:11.661
Yes. I'm sorry,
I really don't have any time.

22:11.744 --> 22:12.830
But I think you do.

22:12.913 --> 22:15.084
OK, fine. Do you have
a piece of paper and a Sharpie?

22:15.168 --> 22:16.504
A Sharpie for what?

22:16.588 --> 22:18.132
I can't sign an autograph
without a Sharpie.

22:18.215 --> 22:20.303
-Ballpoints smudge.
-Wow.

22:20.386 --> 22:21.973
I don't want an autograph.

22:22.056 --> 22:23.685
OK... OK, fine.

22:23.768 --> 22:25.354
But I'm sorry,
I really have to get going.

22:25.438 --> 22:26.941
So please excuse me.
Have a good day.

22:27.025 --> 22:28.612
It's a very busy one for me.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.719
All right,
so what are we lookin' at?

22:40.802 --> 22:42.723
There's gonna be
lot of security tonight.

22:42.806 --> 22:45.353
Armed Gibborim guards.
That was Leslie's job.

22:45.436 --> 22:47.398
-"A lot," like...
-A fleet of vans

22:47.482 --> 22:48.735
should be en route as we speak.

22:48.818 --> 22:51.073
Well, they're not here yet,
which means we still have time.

22:51.156 --> 22:53.745
If we know the Gibb army
is coming in vans,

22:53.828 --> 22:54.830
that's all I need.

22:54.914 --> 22:57.544
I can get into the church records
and then trace the VIN numbers.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.424
If anyone uses a traffic app,
plugs in their phone,

23:00.509 --> 23:02.095
anything using Wi-Fi, we got 'em.

23:02.178 --> 23:04.307
Where'd you learn that?

23:04.391 --> 23:06.813
Remember that family trip
we took to Vegas?

23:06.896 --> 23:08.984
You and Mom went
to go see Cirque de Soleil?

23:09.067 --> 23:11.739
Yeah, you said you wanted to watch
"How to Train Your Dragon 2"

23:11.823 --> 23:14.286
-in the hotel room.
-Yeah, I did, for like five minutes,

23:14.369 --> 23:16.498
and then I snuck into Def Con 23,

23:16.582 --> 23:19.087
where I sat in the back of a seminar
on how to hack a call.

23:21.049 --> 23:22.302
KAROLINA:
So what does that mean?

23:22.385 --> 23:25.016
It means I hope the Gibbs
packed sunscreen,

23:25.099 --> 23:26.351
'cause they're goin' to the desert.

23:26.435 --> 23:27.688
[laptop beeps]

23:28.773 --> 23:30.986
AUDIOBOOK:
...moral view doesn't devalue life,

23:31.069 --> 23:32.823
it makes it more precious,

23:32.906 --> 23:35.912
because now you can begin
to approach every experience...

23:35.996 --> 23:37.666
What are you doing, Aura?
That's going north.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.881
It isn't me. The van's...driving itself.

23:40.964 --> 23:45.389
-Your entire journey can be a joyous...
-AURA: It's a miracle!

23:48.062 --> 23:50.901

24:00.419 --> 24:03.008
Hey, man. Geoffrey Wilder,
how ya doin'?

24:03.092 --> 24:05.639
Hey, look. I left some files
in the trailer over there.
You mind if I get it?

24:05.722 --> 24:08.185
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilder,
but as I'm sure you're aware,

24:08.268 --> 24:10.314
the Church is in charge
of the site now.

24:10.398 --> 24:13.613
I'm sure you know Leslie Dean and I
are founding members of PRIDE.

24:13.696 --> 24:15.534
-She won't mind.
-I don't know.

24:15.617 --> 24:17.746
I got a wavelength demerit
for letting the Yorkes in,

24:17.830 --> 24:20.669
-and they even had ID.
-Yeah, I don't know what that means.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.340
