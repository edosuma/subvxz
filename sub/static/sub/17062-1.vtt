01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.369
The farmer, Duke One,

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:57.448
Gilgamesh,

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.083
and his Disciple

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.979
were branded as traitors.

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:06.286
And for that, we were given the task
of hunting them both down.

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:08.659
<i>So we did just that.</i>

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.160
[Teenage Boy] Gilgamesh--

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:12.457
it wasn't him who betrayed us.

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.366
He happened to know our secrets--

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:18.995
yes, all of our secrets.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:25.505
He knew the reason why we're all here.
He knew our purpose.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.602
But he was too powerful for us.

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:31.346
We were not able to destroy him.

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.778
We could only trap him in a cage.

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:38.756
So you want us to rescue Gilgamesh.

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:41.820
No. You don't understand.

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:46.062
Our hands were stained with blood,
stained with sin,

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:50.033
so we were exiled and imprisoned here.

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:53.963
But there are cracks in the prison.

01:43:54.461 --> 01:43:56.634
And the day is fast approaching

01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:00.405
when the rest of my kin
will begin to escape.

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:05.772
And when that does happen,
this world will become another hell.

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:09.916
And only Gilgamesh can save us all.

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:12.455
[gasps]

01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:14.124
How do you know these secrets?

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:18.228
Not just me.
And therein lies the danger.

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:23.164
You see, a secret is like
a flame in the darkness

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:24.800
with no kindling.

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:27.605
It cannot grow into a fire.

01:44:28.562 --> 01:44:31.008
But even the smallest spark of light...

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:32.709
[hisses]

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:36.813
...is enough to attract predators.

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:41.414
[Dark] I fear no one.
Where is Gilgamesh?

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:42.852
Mm.

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:49.887
The jail used to imprison Gilgamesh...

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:53.256
was inside Hillure.

01:44:57.624 --> 01:44:59.763
<i>[Lady Nox] Gilgamesh discovered
that the High Lords</i>

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:02.864
<i>are more demons than gods- as did I.</i>

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:07.004
<i>But these demons are the ones
who give us our power.</i>

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:11.840
<i>Unlike that fool Gilgamesh,
1 refuse to bite the hand that feeds us.</i>

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:16.354
<i>Because of his strength, the High Lords
had to find somewhere to jail him</i>

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:19.448
<i>from which it was impossible to escape.</i>

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:22.625
<i>Hillure's blood gift
of eternal regeneration</i>

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.253
<i>let him merge with the island</i>

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:27.527
<i>and kept Gilgamesh 's
imprisonment eternal.</i>

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.968
<i>[Dark] So Hiﬂure sacrificed himself,</i>

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:35.170
and then made Lotus
the new immortal Duke.

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:39.271
Because he wanted to release Gilgamesh?

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:40.937
Possibly.

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:46.080
Or maybe.

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.520
<i>Just maybe,</i>

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:51.085
<i>he was tired of eternity,</i>

01:45:52.212 --> 01:45:54.715
<i>living in a state of limbo.</i>

01:45:57.751 --> 01:46:01.631
<i>No one wants to be half-dead forever.</i>

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:24.778
So much secrecy.

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.526
I wonder how many lies
are in this kingdom?

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:31.553
More than you can ever imagine.

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:35.060
<i>I will</i> tell you more,

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:39.101
however, first you must promise me

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.373
that you will stand by my side.

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.240
And what side is that?

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.805
The side that will survive...

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.677
of course.

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:57.381
[moans]

01:46:57.978 --> 01:47:00.151
[laughs softly]

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:07.127
[Lotus] I wanted to be a Duke so badly,

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:10.128
to always remain loyal
to the High Lords.

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:14.528
I wanted to guard Ashland with my life.

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:17.874
But it turns out the Dukes
are just ignorant pawns.

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:20.842
Doing whatever the High Lords want.

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:27.147
And at the end of the day,
we're disposable.

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:30.884
We're practically Spirit Beasts
residing in human form.

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.286
No more and no less.

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.650
I've had to learn to accept that.

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:38.457
It's not easy.

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:43.666
Long ago, the world was filled
with a great number of Dukes--

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:45.500
<i>new Dukes were born,</i>

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:47.838
<i>old Dukes died.</i>

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:51.865
<i>The fortunes of noble families
rose and fell accordingly.</i>

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:55.277
<i>Eventually, legends
were turned into relics.</i>

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:58.282
<i>Their secrets were shrouded in darkness.</i>

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:02.118
<i>Since the dawn of time,
people have killed</i>

01:48:03.543 --> 01:48:04.715
<i>in pursuit of glory...</i>

01:48:05.846 --> 01:48:06.790
<i>wealth...</i>

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:10.693
<i>Power... and justice.</i>

01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:13.230
<i>Yet they all end up in the same place:</i>

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.560
<i>destruction.</i>

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:18.332
<i>They wanted to hoard their Spirit Power</i>

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:21.838
<i>and allow their descendants
to worship them as legends.</i>

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:26.172
<i>Instead, they became cold skeletons,</i>

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.637
<i>their emotions withering away</i>

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.508
<i>until they perished.</i>

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.647
<i>Nothing was left inside them</i>

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:39.213
<i>but an insatiable desire
for even more Spirit Power--</i>

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:44.088
<i>a dark, soulless ambition
that filIs this world with blealmess.</i>

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:52.296
So, then, are you going
to help me practice?

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:59.407
[soft whooshing]

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.746
<i>[Lotus] When 1 found out
about all this, it was a burden.</i>

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.917
It was hard to cope.

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:14.949
Not now.

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:18.325
Now there's only one thing
left for me to feel.

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:20.524
- Sorrow?
- Anger.

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:22.466
Now tell me...

01:49:27.994 --> 01:49:31.271
Ever since the catastrophe
first happened four years ago,

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:33.140
you've kept a low profile.

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.778
You've maintained a dignified silence,

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:40.707
you've kept away from the fight
for power and control.

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:43.251
What I wouldn't give to see Gilgamesh.

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.749
[thunder crackles]

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:49.524
I was his Disciple then.

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:55.898
And so... my heart
still remains with him.

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:59.003
What about Asbel?

01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:24.827
Ahh.

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:33.262
- Hmm.
- Huh.

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:37.700
Asbel, don't worry.

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:41.845
I'll return... eventually.

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.882
[gasp]

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:32.963
<i>[Silver] To save Gilgamesh,
we must overcome many hurdles.</i>

01:51:33.386 --> 01:51:36.731
<i>We will become enemies of all the Dukes
and of their Disciples.</i>

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.592
<i>Danger lies ahead.</i>

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.002
<i>But there is hope 'm the darkness-</i>

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:44.664
<i>a pinprick, yet bright enough
to follow, and believe in.</i>

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:48.209
<i>Gilgamesh, I will see you again.</i>

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.509
<i>Your prison is no longer eternal.</i>

01:51:51.705 --> 01:51:54.549
<i>You will awaken, and you will save us.</i>

01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:04.355
[thunder rumbles]

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:59.545
[man singing song in Mandarin]
