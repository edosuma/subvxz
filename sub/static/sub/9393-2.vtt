00:34.987 --> 00:37.355
Oh, Stewie,
how exciting!

00:37.389 --> 00:39.507
Your first visit to
a real fire station!

00:39.541 --> 00:42.610
Yeah, you kids always loved your
first trip to the fire station.

00:42.644 --> 00:43.928
You remember when we took Meg?

00:47.783 --> 00:50.451
Welcome to the Quahog
Fire Department, folks.

00:50.486 --> 00:51.786
I'm Captain Beckman.

00:51.820 --> 00:52.954
Let me know if you
have any questions

00:52.988 --> 00:54.121
that I can
answer for you.

00:54.156 --> 00:55.623
What's up, nerds?

00:55.657 --> 00:58.860
You waiting for some guy to
fall asleep with a cigarette?

00:58.894 --> 01:00.461
Lazy fire turds!

01:00.496 --> 01:02.129
Have another donut, pig!

01:02.164 --> 01:04.197
We got guns! You got hoses!

01:04.233 --> 01:05.900
See you on the softball field!

01:11.306 --> 01:14.292
Over here is our kitchen,
where we make all our meals.

01:14.326 --> 01:16.027
And upstairs
is where we sleep.

01:16.061 --> 01:17.828
What about your
wives and families?

01:17.863 --> 01:20.531
Sometimes we don't see them
for long periods of time.

01:20.566 --> 01:22.466
Well, that sounds
awfully lonely.

01:22.501 --> 01:24.835
Like being an NBA player
on the road.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.938
Baby, I miss my wife so much.

01:26.972 --> 01:28.773
Thanks for understanding
that we can't do anything.

01:28.807 --> 01:30.174
I just want to cuddle.

01:30.209 --> 01:31.576
Oh, you're so sweet.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.344
I'm just doing
what a man should do.

01:33.378 --> 01:35.880
Respecting the sacred
institution of marriage.

01:35.914 --> 01:37.949
And now, straight to sleep.

01:37.983 --> 01:40.551
<i>This message brought</i>
<i>to you by the NBA.</i>

01:40.586 --> 01:42.220
<i>Let's all pretend this happens.</i>

01:42.254 --> 01:44.722
Hey, Chris, you think it's safe
to drink from a fire hose?

01:44.773 --> 01:46.507
Why not, Dad?
It's just water.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.526
All right, well, turn it on.
I'm very thirsty.

01:50.913 --> 01:52.129
Nice job, Chris.

01:52.164 --> 01:53.664
You got my shirt wet.

01:53.699 --> 01:55.233
Now, few people realize

01:55.267 --> 01:57.835
that until 1928
there were no hoses,

01:57.869 --> 02:00.805
and you actually had to fight
fires with your bare hands.

02:00.839 --> 02:02.840
I will now give
a demonstration.

02:10.832 --> 02:12.984
Whoa, scrappy little blaze, huh?

02:13.018 --> 02:15.036
Oh, my God,
the fire's got a gun!

02:18.006 --> 02:19.774
What the  was that?

02:23.378 --> 02:24.512
Come on, Stewie.
We're going.

02:24.546 --> 02:25.746
Just a moment, Brian.

02:25.781 --> 02:27.081
I'm pretending
I'm a fireman.

02:27.115 --> 02:28.783
I love playing pretend.

02:28.817 --> 02:31.469
My name's Peter
and I work in the brewery.

02:31.503 --> 02:32.903
Now I'm gonna put on my pants

02:32.938 --> 02:34.472
and go talk
to my coworkers at...

02:34.506 --> 02:36.040
These pants have
stool in them.

02:39.995 --> 02:43.264
Well, I hope everyone had a fun
afternoon at the firehouse.

02:43.298 --> 02:44.699
I sure did, Mom!

02:44.733 --> 02:47.885
I can't wait for the
next family outing!

02:49.921 --> 02:51.389
Aw, thanks, Mike.

02:51.423 --> 02:52.823
I hate fire stations.

02:52.858 --> 02:54.825
No problem, man.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.927
Is that alcohol
on your breath?

02:56.962 --> 02:58.179
Yeah, maybe.

02:58.213 --> 03:00.715
You're playing this
too fast and loose, Mike!

03:05.170 --> 03:06.470
Ooh, ooh, is
that the mail?

03:06.505 --> 03:08.139
Yeah.
Is there anything in there for me?

03:08.173 --> 03:09.540
I want to see if
there's a response

03:09.574 --> 03:11.208
to all those fan letters
I've been writing.

03:11.243 --> 03:13.244
<i>Dear Cary Elwes,</i>

03:13.278 --> 03:15.980
<i>I have been meaning to</i>
<i>contact you for some time.</i>

03:16.014 --> 03:19.050
<i>I have never been able to</i>
<i>figure out if you are famous.</i>

03:19.084 --> 03:20.951
<i>You were a big deal</i>
<i>in one thing,</i>

03:20.986 --> 03:23.788
<i>but you were wearing</i>
<i>a mask for most of it.</i>

03:23.822 --> 03:26.290
<i>Do you consider your</i>
<i>career a disappointment?</i>

03:26.325 --> 03:29.193
<i>Or rather, did you exceed</i>
<i>your own expectations?</i>

03:29.227 --> 03:31.462
<i>Yours truly, Peter Griffin.</i>

03:31.496 --> 03:34.765
<i>P.S. You were in</i>
Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.634
<i>Did you know that?</i>

03:36.668 --> 03:38.803
Hey, there's something here
from the Nielsen Company.

03:39.838 --> 03:41.472
"Dear Griffin family,

03:41.506 --> 03:44.342
"You have been specially
selected from amongst millions

03:44.376 --> 03:47.244
"of American households
to be a Nielsen family,

03:47.279 --> 03:50.881
"and as such, to have your
TV viewing habits monitored

03:50.916 --> 03:53.818
in order to measure
television ratings."

03:53.852 --> 03:57.088
Oh, kids, this came
all the way from Delaware.

03:57.122 --> 03:58.522
What does all
that mean?

03:58.557 --> 04:00.975
Well, Meg, it sounds like
they want us to be part of

04:01.009 --> 04:03.310
a select group of people that
helps determine what's on TV.

04:03.328 --> 04:04.762
We're gonna be a Nielsen family?

04:04.796 --> 04:05.763
That's awesome!

04:09.634 --> 04:10.735
I think... uh...

04:10.769 --> 04:12.603
I think that's
the wrong music.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.774
There you go.

04:23.670 --> 04:26.738
Now, this Nielsen box will keep
track of everything you watch,

04:26.773 --> 04:29.074
which helps us generalize
the viewing habits

04:29.108 --> 04:30.642
of millions of Americans.

04:30.677 --> 04:32.077
Ah, yes.

04:32.111 --> 04:34.146
And what was that beginning,
middle and end part again?

04:34.180 --> 04:35.514
Um...

04:35.548 --> 04:38.784
this Nielsen box will keep track
of everything you watch,

04:38.818 --> 04:40.886
which helps us generalize
the viewing habits

04:40.920 --> 04:42.387
of millions of Americans.

04:42.422 --> 04:44.506
Is there any way you can
describe that to me

04:44.540 --> 04:46.024
using colorful puppets
of some sort?

04:48.044 --> 04:51.346
The Nielsen box will monitor
your viewing habits!

04:52.715 --> 04:56.351
I don't like the left puppet.
His chin is scary.

04:57.954 --> 04:59.821
Well, thanks
for your cooperation.

04:59.856 --> 05:01.923
If you have any questions,
please call me.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.659
And welcome
to the Nielsen family.

05:03.693 --> 05:06.261
Thank you very much.

05:06.295 --> 05:07.713
Well, isn't this exciting.

05:07.747 --> 05:09.881
I know, I can't believe
we're a Nielsen family!

05:09.916 --> 05:11.800
I never get picked
for anything.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:28.351 --> 05:29.484
All right, everyone.

05:29.519 --> 05:31.053
Time to do
our Nielsen duty.

05:31.087 --> 05:32.387
So, what are we gonna watch?

05:32.422 --> 05:33.822
Boobs!
<i>Project Runway!</i>

05:33.856 --> 05:36.058
<i>The Good Wife!</i>
That black version of our show!

05:36.092 --> 05:38.093
You know, guys, this
is a real opportunity

05:38.127 --> 05:39.594
to promote quality
programming.

05:39.629 --> 05:40.979
I think we should
watch PBS.

05:41.013 --> 05:42.981
Yeah, you're real
passionate about PBS.

05:43.015 --> 05:46.118
You donated once five years ago
and they sent you a mug.

05:46.152 --> 05:48.620
And now the mug's so old
that the "P" has been worn off

05:48.654 --> 05:49.971
so it just says "B.S."

05:50.006 --> 05:52.641
It's libtards like you that are
screwing up our country.

05:55.511 --> 05:57.479
Tom Tucker?
What are you doing here?

05:57.513 --> 05:59.147
Well, I heard you're
the new Nielsen family.

05:59.182 --> 06:01.349
Just hoping you plan to watch
the Channel Five News.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.151
I don't know.
I've missed so many.

06:03.186 --> 06:04.786
It's gonna take me
forever to catch up.

06:04.821 --> 06:06.722
Well, we'd sure love
to have you as a viewer.

06:06.756 --> 06:07.956
Is there anything we can do

06:07.990 --> 06:09.402
to make the news
more appealing to you?

06:09.427 --> 06:10.492
Maybe.

06:10.493 --> 06:12.194
I guess you could
lose the moustache.

06:12.228 --> 06:13.395
Lose my moustache?

06:13.429 --> 06:15.397
Well, gosh, I...
I don't know.

06:15.431 --> 06:16.898
My birthmark
makes it kind of tough.

06:16.933 --> 06:19.267
Always caused me problems
at my old job.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.703
And that'll do it for us here
at Channel 12 News.

06:21.738 --> 06:23.305
Make sure you turn
those clocks ahead.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.639
Good night, St. Louis.

06:24.674 --> 06:25.841
Yeah, I don't know,

06:25.875 --> 06:27.576
I was never that crazy
about the moustache.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.811
Well, I suppose I could lose it
and just use more makeup.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.213
Yeah, that'd be cool.

06:31.247 --> 06:33.548
And maybe a festive hat would
make things more festive.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.650
All right, this is good.
Any other suggestions?

06:35.685 --> 06:37.185
Yeah, can you end each show

06:37.220 --> 06:39.688
by trying to pull-start
a very cold chain saw?

06:39.722 --> 06:40.956
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.491
All right, thank you
for being so candid.

06:42.525 --> 06:43.759
Hey, thanks for listening.

06:43.793 --> 06:45.861
I know how hard it is
to take criticism.

06:46.896 --> 06:48.263
Hey, nice boots, Griffin.

06:48.297 --> 06:50.499
They sell men's shoes
where you got those?

06:50.533 --> 06:52.434
<i>You made a commitment</i>
<i>to these boots, Peter.</i>

06:52.468 --> 06:54.069
<i>These boots are the new you,</i>

06:54.103 --> 06:55.403
<i>and no one will shake that.</i>

06:55.438 --> 06:58.206
Yee-haw, ride 'em, cowgirl!

06:58.241 --> 07:00.008
<i>Okay, you can take</i>
<i>the boots off at lunch.</i>

07:00.042 --> 07:01.676
<i>Go to the gym.</i>
<i>Have a workout.</i>

07:01.711 --> 07:03.178
<i>Come back in your sneakers.</i>

07:03.212 --> 07:05.247
<i>If anyone asks, you forgot</i>
<i>the boots in your locker.</i>

07:05.281 --> 07:06.681
<i>Just make it to lunch.</i>

07:06.716 --> 07:08.550
Those boots are
made for walkin'.

07:08.584 --> 07:10.085
Up to guys' butts.

07:12.288 --> 07:14.055
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

07:17.460 --> 07:18.593
Good evening, Quahog.

07:18.628 --> 07:20.495
Tonight, Channel Five
mourns the loss

07:20.530 --> 07:21.797
of a dear colleague.

07:21.831 --> 07:23.265
My moustache.

07:23.299 --> 07:25.567
And as per the wishes
of my moustache,

07:25.601 --> 07:28.103
his ashes were sprinkled
off the coast of Acapulco

07:28.137 --> 07:29.271
where he was born.

07:29.305 --> 07:30.939
Well, that'll do it for us here.

07:30.973 --> 07:32.274
Thanks for watching
Channel Five,

07:32.308 --> 07:34.309
the most trusted name in news.

07:36.712 --> 07:38.914
Ah, crap.

07:38.948 --> 07:40.949
Oh, come on.

07:42.785 --> 07:44.953
Let's go, Tom.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.521
Work, damn it!

07:46.556 --> 07:47.589
What the hell?

07:47.623 --> 07:48.924
What's going on
with the news?

07:48.958 --> 07:51.126
This is terrible!
Yeah, has he lost his mind?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.561
Well, I'll be damned.

07:52.595 --> 07:54.763
If I knew he was gonna do
all that stuff I told him,

07:54.797 --> 07:56.097
I would've told him
more stuff.

07:56.132 --> 07:57.299
What?

07:57.333 --> 07:59.301
Peter, you told him
to do this crap?

07:59.335 --> 08:00.836
Yeah, he came to my house
when he found out

08:00.870 --> 08:02.904
I was a Nielsen family,
asked what I wanted to see.

08:02.939 --> 08:04.472
Hey, hey, you know
what would be cool?

08:04.507 --> 08:06.808
If he did the news with
a family of prairie dogs,

08:06.843 --> 08:08.443
and whenever he said
something sad,

08:08.477 --> 08:10.545
they'd pop their heads up,
all concerned.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.247
Peter, you sure that's
such a good idea?

08:12.281 --> 08:14.482
People rely on the local news
to provide them with

08:14.517 --> 08:17.285
several stories a year on how
saltwater taffy is made.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.221
Yeah, if you're
a Nielsen family,

08:19.255 --> 08:21.156
it seems like you
should maybe be

08:21.190 --> 08:22.657
a little more thoughtful
with your choices.

08:22.692 --> 08:23.825
What are you talking about?

08:23.860 --> 08:25.060
I'm just having a little fun.

08:25.094 --> 08:26.528
For God's sakes,
I've just been handed

08:26.562 --> 08:28.196
the coolest freaking toy
on the planet.

08:28.231 --> 08:31.566
Well, you know, except for
Hungry Hungry Alec Baldwins.

08:33.436 --> 08:36.171
Hey, I'm not... I'm not
even touching the lever.

08:40.977 --> 08:43.477
Chilling news
from Long Island Sound,

08:43.511 --> 08:45.747
as a four-passenger prop plane
on its way to East Hampton

08:45.781 --> 08:47.816
spun into the surf
off Montauk Point.

08:48.651 --> 08:51.019
There were no survivors.

08:51.053 --> 08:53.521
Oh, that's so great, I just
called him on the way home!

08:53.556 --> 08:56.091
Peter, I'm not sure this
is entirely responsible.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.425
I don't see what
the big deal is.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.027
I was just trying
to make the show better.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.929
Hell, I wish I could do it
with all the shows.

09:00.963 --> 09:02.664
Yeah, well, you only have
one Nielsen box.

09:02.698 --> 09:04.432
You don't have the clout
to affect national shows.

09:04.467 --> 09:05.667
Damn it.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.068
I guess that means
I'll never get to see

09:07.103 --> 09:09.104
an episode of <i>Superman</i>
where Clark Kent and Lois Lane

09:09.138 --> 09:10.672
finally get together.

09:10.706 --> 09:11.973
Lois, I love you,

09:12.008 --> 09:15.243
and I want there to be
no more secrets between us.

09:15.278 --> 09:16.912
I am Superman.

09:16.946 --> 09:18.246
Oh, my God.

09:18.281 --> 09:20.115
The only thing that can
kill me is kryptonite.

09:20.149 --> 09:21.650
Or latex.

09:21.684 --> 09:22.817
Or lambskin.

09:22.852 --> 09:24.552
What about polyurethane?
All that.

09:24.587 --> 09:25.553
All that stuff.

09:27.590 --> 09:28.857
Hi, folks.

09:28.891 --> 09:30.926
Just thought I'd stop by
and make sure your equipment

09:30.960 --> 09:33.061
is working properly and see
if you have any questions.

09:33.095 --> 09:34.729
Yeah, is something wrong
with our remote?

09:34.764 --> 09:36.498
No matter how low
I turn the volume,

09:36.532 --> 09:38.500
Aziz Ansari is always
shouting at me.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.168
What did I do?

09:40.202 --> 09:41.970
Thank you.
I think we're good.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.471
Everything seems
to be going well.

09:43.506 --> 09:44.539
Okay, great.

09:44.573 --> 09:46.074
Well, I'm just gonna
change out the card

09:46.108 --> 09:48.376
on your unit real quick
and I'll be on my way.

10:00.356 --> 10:01.656
Well, we're all set.

10:01.691 --> 10:02.691
Thanks for your time.

10:02.725 --> 10:04.059
No, thank you, pal.

10:04.093 --> 10:05.427
And hey, you've been
working hard.

10:05.461 --> 10:07.095
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off?

10:07.129 --> 10:09.431
Here's two tickets to Sandra
Bernhard's one-woman show.

10:09.465 --> 10:10.632
Wow, thanks!

10:10.666 --> 10:11.800
Yeah, and they're
great seats.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.168
They're right in
the gap of her teeth.

10:13.202 --> 10:14.736
Social media?

10:14.770 --> 10:16.404
More like a social disease.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.374
Ha! That's funny!

10:23.412 --> 10:25.714
Peter, what the hell's
going on here?

10:25.748 --> 10:28.149
Lois, we're no longer
one Nielsen family.

10:28.184 --> 10:30.051
We're 100.

10:30.086 --> 10:31.386
More boxes, more power.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.221
And I got some ideas
to make TV better.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.193
Hello, <i>Mad Men</i>
production office.

10:38.227 --> 10:39.327
Yeah, Peter Griffin here.

10:39.362 --> 10:40.829
Could I speak with
Jon Hamm, please?

10:40.863 --> 10:42.097
One moment.

10:43.132 --> 10:44.766
Hello?
Hello, Jon Hamm?

10:44.800 --> 10:46.034
Peter Griffin,
Nielsen family.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.569
Listen, did I catch
you at a good time,

10:47.603 --> 10:50.071
or are you and the critics busy
sucking each other's butts?

10:50.106 --> 10:51.206
Excuse me?

10:51.240 --> 10:52.707
Look, your show
is really boring.

10:52.742 --> 10:54.009
But don't worry,
I got some ideas

10:54.043 --> 10:55.143
on how you
can jazz it up.

10:55.177 --> 10:56.978
Listen, I don't need
your suggestions, pal.

10:57.013 --> 10:59.581
I've been a big celebrity
for a year and a half now.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.149
Okay, if that's
how you're gonna be.

11:01.183 --> 11:02.751
We'll see how
this plays out.

11:02.785 --> 11:05.053
Lois, we're not watching
<i>Mad Men</i> no more.

11:09.592 --> 11:10.558
Hello?

11:10.593 --> 11:12.160
Look, I may have been
a little rash.

11:12.194 --> 11:13.828
Our ratings
have dropped 50%.

11:13.863 --> 11:15.930
Whatever suggestions
you have, I'll listen.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.401
And so, gentlemen,
in baseball,

11:19.435 --> 11:21.536
three strikes
and you're out.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.338
But three Lucky Strikes...

11:23.372 --> 11:25.473
and you're in.

11:25.508 --> 11:26.674
Nice try, Don.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.109
But I'm afraid
we're going to have

11:28.144 --> 11:29.444
to take our business
elsewhere.

11:29.478 --> 11:31.579
Oh? don't think so.

11:34.984 --> 11:37.452
(playing <i>Star Wars</i> theme)

11:40.856 --> 11:42.624
What the hell was that?

11:42.658 --> 11:44.092
I'll tell you
what it was, Lois.

11:44.126 --> 11:45.260
It was awesome.

11:45.294 --> 11:46.928
And wait'll
you see <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

11:46.962 --> 11:49.431
I don't know what it was,
but now it's on roller skates.

11:51.634 --> 11:53.568
Hi, NBC,
this is Peter Griffin.

11:53.602 --> 11:55.470
Listen, you guys
are doing a great job.

11:55.504 --> 11:59.240
If anybody knows what America
wants in the '90s, it's NBC.

11:59.275 --> 12:01.176
But I just have
one small request:

12:01.210 --> 12:04.179
I like Dateline, but I really
hate waiting two hours

12:04.213 --> 12:05.780
to find out who the killer is.

12:05.815 --> 12:08.316
<i>Tonight on</i> Dateline,
<i>a woman murdered.</i>

12:08.350 --> 12:10.018
<i>Was it her ex-boyfriend?</i>

12:10.052 --> 12:11.519
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

12:11.554 --> 12:12.620
I knew it.

12:12.655 --> 12:15.023
I knew it was the ex-boyfriend.

12:18.427 --> 12:20.028
"Sleep tight, truck.

12:20.062 --> 12:22.464
"Sleep tight, firefly.

12:22.498 --> 12:24.799
"Sleep tight, chair.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.168
Sleep tight, bird."

12:27.203 --> 12:28.303
You see that, Peter?

12:28.337 --> 12:29.571
You see the bird?

12:29.605 --> 12:30.772
Bird.

12:30.806 --> 12:32.507
Okay, we'll, uh,
pick up the rest tomorrow.

12:32.541 --> 12:35.710
Uh, now, I'm just gonna vamp for
a while with some random noises.

12:35.744 --> 12:37.345
Hee-hee!

12:37.379 --> 12:39.514
Heya, heya, heya.

12:41.584 --> 12:42.917
Uh-heh, uh-heh...

12:48.057 --> 12:49.023
Okay, good night, Peter.

12:49.058 --> 12:50.091
Good night, Dave.

12:50.126 --> 12:51.459
And, uh, here's Paul

12:51.494 --> 12:53.061
to play you to sleep
with a lullaby.

12:53.095 --> 12:54.562
♪ Hey, lullaby... ♪

12:54.597 --> 12:55.930
♪ Oh, lullaby ♪

12:55.965 --> 12:57.799
♪ Hey, you, lullaby... ♪

12:57.833 --> 12:58.833
Stop, no, stop.

12:58.868 --> 12:59.834
Stop.

12:59.869 --> 13:01.536
I forgot, he's terrible.

13:04.573 --> 13:07.609
<i>We now return to</i>
Cops With Banana Guns.

13:07.643 --> 13:10.011
Freeze!

13:10.045 --> 13:12.080
Is that...
is that a banana?

13:12.114 --> 13:13.481
Don't worry
about what it is.

13:13.516 --> 13:15.250
I'm still a cop.

13:15.284 --> 13:16.518
Whoa, hold on.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.520
All-All right, just...
just take it easy.

13:18.554 --> 13:20.622
This can go
a couple of ways.

13:20.656 --> 13:22.857
What the hell
did Peter do to <i>Cops?!</i>

13:22.892 --> 13:25.326
Bonnie!
Come push me out in a huff!

13:30.266 --> 13:31.699
Peter, what is this show?

13:31.734 --> 13:34.035
It's called <i>Creeping Up</i>
<i>on the Kardashians.</i>

13:34.069 --> 13:35.770
See that guy with the
ponytail in the background?

13:35.804 --> 13:37.939
He sneaks up and
scares the girls

13:37.973 --> 13:39.407
while they're
starting businesses

13:39.441 --> 13:40.875
or getting
their fat waxed.

13:42.178 --> 13:43.244
What the hell?!

13:46.448 --> 13:48.550
There they are!
That's the Nielsen family!

13:48.584 --> 13:50.051
You ruined television!

13:50.085 --> 13:52.320
Now it's just
a big, old, silly mess!

13:52.354 --> 13:54.656
Oh, God! An angry mob!

13:54.690 --> 13:57.592
I've got to swallow all my
valuables and get out of here!

14:09.438 --> 14:11.005
Did you see the mob?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.140
Did I see the mob?

14:12.174 --> 14:13.575
Why else am I here?

14:19.154 --> 14:21.522
Oh, my God, Peter,
they're really angry!

14:21.557 --> 14:23.190
Say something!

14:23.225 --> 14:24.275
W-Wait.
What the hell's going on?

14:24.309 --> 14:25.693
What do you mean,
I ruined television?

14:25.727 --> 14:27.762
You put a real cougar
on <i>Cougar Town,</i>

14:27.796 --> 14:29.230
and now that cougar's dead

14:29.264 --> 14:31.999
because Courtney Cox ripped it
apart with her teeth and claws!

14:32.034 --> 14:35.703
You turned <i>Anderson Cooper 360</i>
into <i>Anderson Cooper 720!</i>

14:35.737 --> 14:37.238
He's turning around too much!

14:37.272 --> 14:39.640
You converted <i>The Biggest Loser</i>
to the metric system!

14:39.675 --> 14:41.642
Now it feels like
they're not losing enough!

14:41.677 --> 14:43.144
Aw, the hell with you guys!

14:43.178 --> 14:45.746
You're just jealous 'cause I get
to say what's on TV now!

14:45.781 --> 14:47.848
I am a Nielsen god!

14:54.256 --> 14:55.456
Sorry, y'all.

14:55.490 --> 14:58.059
That's the first time
I ever throwed anything.

15:02.764 --> 15:05.299
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Nielsen himself.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.501
Nurse, who's the worst
doctor in this hospital?

15:07.536 --> 15:08.736
You are,
Dr. Hartman.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.404
Good.
Put Hartman on this bozo.

15:10.439 --> 15:11.772
Hey, what can
I do for you?

15:11.807 --> 15:13.808
Please, Doc, you got to
help me with this nasty gash.

15:13.842 --> 15:14.842
What seems
to be the problem?

15:14.876 --> 15:16.243
No, it's my husband.

15:16.278 --> 15:18.479
Oh. Well, you've got a lot
of nerve coming in here

15:18.513 --> 15:19.714
after what you
did to television.

15:19.748 --> 15:20.881
Now, get out!

15:20.916 --> 15:22.783
Please, Doctor,
you've got to help him.

15:22.818 --> 15:25.119
You took an oath when
you went to medical school.

15:25.153 --> 15:26.954
I took a lot of things when
I went to medical school.

15:26.989 --> 15:28.756
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to answer this.

15:28.790 --> 15:29.957
Hello?

15:29.992 --> 15:31.759
Ah, Hartman!

15:36.498 --> 15:37.632
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

15:37.666 --> 15:38.666
Not so good, Peter.

15:38.700 --> 15:39.800
Yeah, me, either.

15:39.835 --> 15:41.836
Thanks to you,
TV's a vast wasteland.

15:41.870 --> 15:43.104
You know how
I know that phrase?

15:43.138 --> 15:44.472
I read it in a book,
you monster!

15:44.506 --> 15:46.107
Aw, come on, let me
make it up to you.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.141
Let me buy you a beer.

15:47.175 --> 15:48.876
No, that seat's taken.

15:48.910 --> 15:49.944
Move along, Peter.

15:49.978 --> 15:51.646
What are you
talking about?

15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
You guys are my pals.

15:52.714 --> 15:53.781
We used to be, Peter.

15:53.815 --> 15:54.882
Now, scram.

15:54.916 --> 15:57.118
Well, fine,
I'll sit at the bar.

15:57.152 --> 15:58.753
Not at my bar, you won't.

15:58.787 --> 16:00.054
Get out of here!

16:00.088 --> 16:02.189
Geez, I can't
show my face anywhere.

16:02.224 --> 16:04.725
I might as well be back
doing public radio.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.127
This is Peter Griffin,

16:06.161 --> 16:09.497
and you're listening
to <i>Book Talk</i> on WRNI.

16:09.531 --> 16:10.798
Today we'll be discussing

16:10.832 --> 16:12.667
Bret Easton Ellis's
popular work,

16:12.701 --> 16:16.404
<i>Less Than Zero,</i> a tale
of privilege, detachment

16:16.438 --> 16:18.606
and youthful alienation.

16:22.144 --> 16:23.811
But first,
a word from our sponsor,

16:23.845 --> 16:26.047
Westin's Golden Soda Biscuits.

16:26.081 --> 16:27.748
I'm enjoying one right now.

16:29.918 --> 16:31.352
Mmm.

16:35.357 --> 16:37.058
Mmm.

16:40.495 --> 16:42.063
Mmm.

16:50.338 --> 16:52.339
Mmm.

16:55.811 --> 16:58.112
That concludes
today's session of <i>Book Talk.</i>

16:58.146 --> 17:00.881
Tune in tomorrow when we will
look at John Kennedy Toole's

17:00.916 --> 17:03.984
unheralded early work,
<i>The Neon Bible.</i>

17:07.955 --> 17:09.356
Hey, what's wrong, Peter?

17:09.391 --> 17:10.891
I miss my friends, Brian.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.227
I mean, I was having fun
with those Nielsen boxes,

17:13.261 --> 17:14.795
but what's the point

17:14.829 --> 17:17.431
if I don't got Joe and
Quagmire to enjoy it with me?

17:17.465 --> 17:20.267
I guess I shouldn't have
messed with television.

17:20.301 --> 17:22.269
Well, it's not
exactly your fault.

17:22.304 --> 17:23.671
The networks never should
have listened to you

17:23.704 --> 17:24.905
in the first place.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.574
This is exactly what
makes bad television:

17:26.608 --> 17:28.509
pandering to the lowest
common denominator.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.144
So what do I do, Brian?

17:30.178 --> 17:31.679
Well, you still
have these boxes.

17:31.713 --> 17:34.615
That means you still have the
power to influence television.

17:34.649 --> 17:36.717
Maybe you can use that
power to help restore TV

17:36.752 --> 17:37.852
to the way it was.

17:37.886 --> 17:39.053
You're right, Brian.

17:39.087 --> 17:41.055
Maybe if I watch
smart, quality shows,

17:41.089 --> 17:42.723
that'll help get things back
to the way they were.

17:42.758 --> 17:45.159
We can use these boxes
for good and...

17:46.294 --> 17:47.828
What the hell?!

17:47.863 --> 17:51.565
That's for adding another tree
to <i>One Tree Hill!</i>

17:51.600 --> 17:54.034
Oh, my God, he destroyed
every last box!

17:54.069 --> 17:55.336
Holy crap!

17:55.370 --> 17:56.904
We're sunk now, Peter.

17:56.938 --> 18:00.274
There goes your one chance to
get TV back to the way it was.

18:00.308 --> 18:02.176
Wait a minute.
Maybe not, Brian.

18:02.210 --> 18:05.012
I think I just got an idea.

18:05.046 --> 18:06.747
Aah!
I got glass in my face!

18:06.782 --> 18:09.216
Oh, crap.
Now I forgot what it was.

18:09.251 --> 18:10.284
I got it!

18:10.318 --> 18:11.786
Aah! Son of a bitch!

18:15.390 --> 18:16.423
You know who I hate?

18:16.458 --> 18:17.458
The troops.

18:17.492 --> 18:18.793
Yeah, me, too.

18:18.827 --> 18:20.327
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who are you?

18:20.362 --> 18:21.529
I'm Peter Griffin.

18:21.563 --> 18:22.930
I'm the guy
who ruined television,

18:22.964 --> 18:24.331
and I'm the guy
who's gonna fix it.

18:24.366 --> 18:25.366
Guys!

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
I broke television,

18:26.434 --> 18:27.935
and now you have
to help me fix it!

18:27.969 --> 18:29.069
Yah-ha!

18:29.104 --> 18:31.405
Looks like this is one
we beat you to.

18:35.277 --> 18:37.344
Gentlemen, I have
gathered you all here today

18:37.379 --> 18:39.847
because you are the creators
of what television used to be

18:39.881 --> 18:41.248
before I ruined it.

18:41.283 --> 18:44.051
And we need to rebuild
television from the ground up.

18:44.085 --> 18:46.987
So, I'm gonna need
all your best ideas.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.723
J.J. Abrams, you take
wonder and complexity

18:49.758 --> 18:51.826
and present it in a way that
no one can possibly understand.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.093
Whaddaya got?!

18:53.128 --> 18:55.062
I've got an alien
that goes back in time

18:55.096 --> 18:57.965
and encounters a koala bear
in an Eastern European town.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.500
Totally confused.
Do it!

18:59.534 --> 19:02.036
Okay, now, we're gonna need
15 workplace comedies

19:02.070 --> 19:03.904
where people talk
to the camera for some reason.

19:03.939 --> 19:05.940
You, you, you and you-- go.

19:07.008 --> 19:08.309
When Peter told me to make

19:08.343 --> 19:09.677
a workplace comedy
where people talk

19:09.711 --> 19:10.978
to the camera, I thought...

19:11.012 --> 19:12.646
Not now!
I mean, go do a show!

19:12.681 --> 19:15.049
Don't-don't do
that thing here.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.083
Huh.

19:16.117 --> 19:17.384
Wonder if I can
pull off one of those

19:17.419 --> 19:19.420
"can you believe what
I have to put up with" looks

19:19.454 --> 19:20.754
to the camera.

19:23.692 --> 19:26.393
Okay, Mark Burnett, you did
<i>Survivor</i> and <i>The Apprentice.</i>

19:26.428 --> 19:29.196
Can you give me a reality show
where people do horrible,

19:29.231 --> 19:30.598
unforgiveable things
to each other

19:30.632 --> 19:32.299
for embarrassingly
small sums of money?

19:32.334 --> 19:33.467
I got some ideas.

19:33.501 --> 19:36.303
Here's a nickel,
pull down your pants.

19:36.338 --> 19:37.538
There's a show.

19:37.572 --> 19:38.839
Yah-ha! Go!

19:40.275 --> 19:41.642
All right, now,
who's gonna make a show

19:41.676 --> 19:42.743
about horrible
New Jersey freaks?

19:42.777 --> 19:43.911
You know what?
I don't care.

19:43.945 --> 19:44.945
Just someone, do it!

19:45.981 --> 19:47.181
Okay, Dick Wolf,

19:47.215 --> 19:49.250
make the same <i>Law and Order</i>
six times.

19:49.284 --> 19:51.252
Oh, and also,
could you marry Matt Weiner

19:51.286 --> 19:53.354
'cause I want your name
to be Dick "Weener."

19:53.388 --> 19:55.522
Okay, but can I go by
"Dick Wolf-Weener"?

19:55.557 --> 19:57.491
Oh, my God, yes!
Yes! Yes!

19:57.525 --> 19:59.126
Okay, Bravo people,
go find women fighting.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.594
No, you know what,
just find women.

20:00.629 --> 20:01.862
They'll end up fighting.

20:01.897 --> 20:04.331
All right, everyone who's left,
make a talent show.

20:04.366 --> 20:06.033
We are done.

20:06.067 --> 20:09.303
Oh, Kelsey Grammer,
what are you still doing here?

20:09.337 --> 20:10.638
I-I have nothing left
for you.

20:10.672 --> 20:11.839
I'm... I'm sorry.

20:11.873 --> 20:15.576
Ah. Then I shall take
my ease on the lanai.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.244
I don't care
what you do now.

20:21.383 --> 20:23.684
We now return
to <i>Mike and Molly.</i>

20:23.718 --> 20:25.552
Have you decided
what you'd like to order?

20:25.587 --> 20:27.087
Yes, the chopped salad?

20:27.122 --> 20:28.822
I'll have everything
except that.

20:31.026 --> 20:32.393
That waiter's like, "What?!"

20:32.427 --> 20:33.527
Well, you did it, Peter.

20:33.561 --> 20:35.262
You got TV back to normal.

20:35.297 --> 20:37.398
Yeah, guys,
I'm sorry for screwing up

20:37.432 --> 20:38.666
all your favorite shows.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.934
Ah, that's okay, Peter.

20:39.968 --> 20:40.935
So, what do you say?

20:40.969 --> 20:42.236
Are we pals again?

20:42.270 --> 20:43.815
Ah, course we are.
You bet.

20:43.816 --> 20:45.616
Well, let's drink
to having TV

20:45.651 --> 20:48.186
back in the hands of people
who know what they're doing.

20:49.412 --> 20:51.313
I think <i>Zack and Cody</i>
would be funnier

20:51.347 --> 20:53.315
if they did the show
in their underpants.
