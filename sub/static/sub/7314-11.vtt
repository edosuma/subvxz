WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:05.304
(birds squawking)

00:06.740 --> 00:08.774
You're disturbing
the fish.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.776
It's January, dad.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.344
They are long gone.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.713
Just where do you
think they went?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.482
South. Duh.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.083
Can we go now?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.785
(sighs)

00:20.687 --> 00:22.588
My dad used
to bring me out here.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.190
Health teacher says
abuse is passed down.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.760
I'm just saying this
is a good time to talk,

00:27.762 --> 00:29.194
Man to man.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.462
About what?
School,

00:30.464 --> 00:32.331
Girls...

00:32.333 --> 00:33.599
Sex.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.168
Oh, not this again.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.770
I'm here for you.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.138
Whoa.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.040
Thing must be
a monster.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.508
Shouldn't be afraid
to tell me things.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.810
I'm not a virgin anymore.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.179
What?!

00:47.181 --> 00:49.782
(laughs)
I was just kidding.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.217
Very funny.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.627
(gasps):
Oh, my god!

01:03.530 --> 01:05.531
There's probably
a dead guy down there.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.665
Cool.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.299
(indistinct chatter,
phone ringing)

01:40.301 --> 01:42.835
Remember this?
Room service?

01:42.837 --> 01:46.271
Ah, same undercover operation
where I wore this...

01:46.273 --> 01:47.406
Briefly.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.475
Uh, yeah.
How about this one?

01:49.477 --> 01:51.810
(jamaican accent):
♪ from my perspective

01:51.812 --> 01:55.180
♪ I see the woman
from the big jet plane ♪

01:55.182 --> 01:56.415
♪ the woman look...

01:56.417 --> 01:58.250
Oh, yeah, you guys
weren't there for that.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.552
You know, I get
why they want to free up space

02:00.554 --> 02:01.820
In the storage room, but...

02:01.822 --> 02:04.156
Who's gonna want
any of this old junk?

02:04.158 --> 02:06.191
I'm keeping
the soul patch.
(chuckles)

02:06.193 --> 02:07.559
What's that?

02:07.561 --> 02:10.195
I remember that case.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.563
That's the pregnancy pact.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.565
You looked good in that.
I still would.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.435
I feel like
I'd remember these.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.669
No, I wouldn't touch that.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.272
I washed those, tony.
Both:
They're yours?

02:20.274 --> 02:21.440
You two were not there for that.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.243
Ziva:
Ooh! Finally!

02:24.245 --> 02:26.311
I found something
a little bit more practical.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.313
The matching bra?
Ziva:
Ha!

02:28.315 --> 02:29.882
Wrong kind of padding.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.217
Oh, come on,
when is there time to exercise?

02:32.219 --> 02:34.219
Have you seen what
they did to the ncis gym?

02:34.221 --> 02:35.587
Juice bar!

02:35.589 --> 02:37.222
Nice!
Well, I make time

02:37.224 --> 02:38.423
Outside of work--
it's a good habit

02:38.425 --> 02:40.159
I picked up
from my time in mossad.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.793
Never sweat
where you eat.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.195
Wrong bodily function.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.396
Gibbs:
Yeah, but it's the right idea.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.832
Grab your gear.
Dead body in the potomac.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.437
Getting a new belt, boss?

02:52.439 --> 02:54.339
Nah, it's an old belt.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.175
(sniffs)

02:56.177 --> 02:58.577
Drug bust, '99.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.245
Teenager:
<i>It was so awesome.</i>

03:00.247 --> 03:02.648
When the cops got here,
they sent in these divers

03:02.650 --> 03:03.682
Who found the body.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.184
His jacket was
filled with rocks.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.652
That's a total
body dump, right?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.853
You watched all this?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.255
So what? I'm 13.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.657
I'm so sorry.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.859
Thank you.
You know, if it
wasn't for me

03:13.861 --> 03:16.195
And my dad, you guys would've
never found the dead dude.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.396
Father:
Show some respect.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.299
Sorry, we-we
shouldn't have stayed.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.234
Are you kidding?
Dad, this is, like,

03:22.236 --> 03:24.836
The most bad-ass thing
we've ever done together.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.339
Yeah.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.841
Thanks, dad.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.314
Mcgee: Divers found
the victim's I.D. In a pocket.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.217
Petty officer
second class luke grismer.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.318
(helicopter hovering
in distance)

03:39.320 --> 03:42.487
Ducky:
"keep this item carefully."

03:42.489 --> 03:43.855
Mcgee: No one's
touched the ear

03:43.857 --> 03:46.258
Since we've been here, doc.
I was quoting

03:46.260 --> 03:49.261
The instructions
vincent van gogh
gave to a prostitute

03:49.263 --> 03:51.964
When he handed her
his severed right ear.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.900
Gardez cet objet soigneusement.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.735
What'd he care?
He cut it off.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.538
Yeah, well, historians
are now of the opinion

03:59.540 --> 04:02.441
That the ear could have been
lost in a heated dispute

04:02.443 --> 04:04.943
Between he and fellow painter
paul gauguin.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.379
I'm more interested in
the dispute that someone
had with our victim.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.014
You got a cause
of death, duck?

04:09.016 --> 04:11.917
Well, I won't be sure
of that until I get
him back to autopsy.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.619
However, these
gashes here,

04:13.621 --> 04:16.321
On his head,
may explain

04:16.323 --> 04:19.391
How the ear was pulled
so easily from his body.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.859
Otherwise, the body's
in good condition.

04:20.861 --> 04:24.429
The effect that cold water
has on preserving a body.

04:24.431 --> 04:28.500
His dermis has not even
begun to decompose.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.570
He hasn't been there long.
Less than two days.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.775
Something wrong, boss?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.810
Something's missing.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.346
Didn't you just
say that this was

04:41.348 --> 04:43.315
A petty officer second class?

04:43.317 --> 04:45.284
There's only one chevron.
Well, no sailor

04:45.286 --> 04:47.352
Would willingly give himself
a demotion.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.453
Mcgee, run his print.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.622
Are you aware

04:50.624 --> 04:53.392
That van gogh's suicide
has also been called

04:53.394 --> 04:54.526
Into question?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.761
He was shot

04:55.763 --> 04:57.529
In the stomach
and died two
days later.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.398
Mcgee: Uh, boss, we
got a problem.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.866
Fingerprints are catalogued

05:00.868 --> 05:03.435
For all active service members,
but there's no match.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.571
Not a petty officer
of <i>any</i> class...

05:06.573 --> 05:09.308
He's not military at all.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.643
Then why is he pretending to be?

05:26.059 --> 05:28.460
Well, this is interesting.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.495
(chuckles quietly)

05:30.497 --> 05:32.631
Here it is, the jackpot.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.900
Look what I found
in the last box.
Unless it is

05:34.902 --> 05:37.002
The real identity of our victim,
I do not care.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.372
What is it with you
and old photos lately?

05:40.374 --> 05:42.708
Windows into our past.

05:43.976 --> 05:47.713
They were fitting me
for the prosthetic, tony.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.047
There's nothing
embarrassing
about it.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.516
Oh, not embarrassing;
telling.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.019
You're smiling.
(laughs)

05:54.021 --> 05:57.489
Speaking of smiles,
I think mcgee has something.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.657
Yeah, I got a lead on our body

05:58.659 --> 06:01.993
From a metro
missing persons report.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.495
Same build
and bone structure.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.663
Hairline and color match.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.431
Looks like our
lobe-less victim.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.733
Mcgee:
Tyler wilkes was
reported missing

06:07.735 --> 06:09.634
This morning, by his lawyer.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.937
Wilkes.
That sounds familiar.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.606
Been published
all over the world.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.641
So he's a journalist.
He's more like

06:16.643 --> 06:18.744
A government paparazzi.
Tony: So instead
of looking

06:18.746 --> 06:20.512
For photos of kate middleton
with her top off,

06:20.514 --> 06:22.614
He's trying to catch
the pentagon with
their pants down?

06:22.616 --> 06:26.551
He sold photographs of
opium smuggling on foreign
army bases last year.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.787
Ziva: They turned out to be
digitally altered, right?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.455
Gibbs:
Damage was already done.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.158
No one's willing
to hire him,

06:33.160 --> 06:34.726
But they'll all run his stories.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.595
A man like that could have
many enemies.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.897
Even more if they found out
he was impersonating
navy personnel.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.932
Wilkes had an article
due two days ago.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.567
Drug use in
navy barracks.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.769
What was his latest targets?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.036
Lawyer said she didn't know

06:45.038 --> 06:46.972
Who the story was about;
hadn't read it.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.607
Dinozzo, david.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.008
Start with the real
petty officer grismer.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.110
Ziva: Find out why
wilkes had his I.D.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.745
We need more
from the lawyer.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.580
Boss, she actually
did mention something.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.582
Wilkes has a
large birthmark

06:57.584 --> 07:00.051
Just over the dimple
on his left buttock.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.589
It's for body identification.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.058
But-tock?

07:08.027 --> 07:10.462
Buttock.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.930
At the height of their rivalry

07:11.932 --> 07:15.600
Between joseph pulitzer
and william randolph hearst,

07:15.602 --> 07:18.170
Each ran a comic strip
featuring a character

07:18.172 --> 07:19.671
Called the yellow kid.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.573
Given both
editors' history

07:21.575 --> 07:24.476
Of sensationalized
news coverage,

07:24.478 --> 07:26.778
The term "yellow journalism"
was born.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.547
Let me guess,
you're more interested

07:28.549 --> 07:30.615
In this journalist's death?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.685
Well, I was going to say
"black and blue journalism."

07:33.687 --> 07:35.921
You made a joke.

07:35.923 --> 07:42.194
You're correct in guessing
the cause of mr. Wilkes' death.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.628
Not the head wounds?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.730
No, no, no.
Those were postmortem,

07:45.732 --> 07:47.833
Likely sustained when
the body was dragged along

07:47.835 --> 07:49.134
By the current.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.837
No, the actual cause of death
was exsanguination

07:51.839 --> 07:53.638
From internal bleeding.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.907
I found evidence
of multiple blows

07:55.909 --> 07:57.476
To his chest,

07:57.478 --> 07:59.511
Abdomen and groin.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.480
Painful. Not deadly.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.648
Unless you have...

08:03.650 --> 08:05.684
Mononucleosis.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.053
Victim had mono, duck?
Probably didn't know it.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.490
While the outward signs
can mimic a moderate cold,

08:11.492 --> 08:14.960
The internal results are
swollen glands and organs.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.828
When he was attacked,
he received

08:16.830 --> 08:18.830
A direct hit...

08:18.832 --> 08:20.665
That split...

08:20.667 --> 08:23.668
His already enlarged liver.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.004
Death was an accident.
Perhaps, but...

08:26.006 --> 08:28.707
Given the manner in which
the body was disposed,

08:28.709 --> 08:32.010
Our killer not only knew
that this had become a homicide,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.645
He tried to hide it.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.180
Showed his true colors.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.515
Yes, yellow.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.617
(brief laugh, sigh)

08:38.619 --> 08:41.953
Well, if it hadn't been
for the serendipitous...

08:41.955 --> 08:43.622
Catch of the day,

08:43.624 --> 08:47.592
This body, well, might not
have been found until spring.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.932
(sighs) petty officer,
thanks for coming in.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.901
I'm special
agent dinozzo.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.169
I believe this
belongs to you.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.672
Oh, man, you found it!

09:00.674 --> 09:03.642
My chief would've
conniptioned if I had
to report I lost this puppy.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.744
Whew! Saved me
a bunch of trouble.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.612
Our pleasure.

09:07.614 --> 09:08.847
So...

09:08.849 --> 09:10.749
Thanks.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.083
Hey!

09:12.085 --> 09:13.952
Aren't you a
little curious

09:13.954 --> 09:16.254
Why you're in an ncis
interrogation room?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.657
Or... Why your I.D. Is...

09:18.659 --> 09:21.326
In a sealed
evidence bag?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.728
Uh, y-y...

09:23.730 --> 09:26.031
Yeah, I guess
that's kind of weird.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.199
What's going on?
Somebody was...

09:28.201 --> 09:30.201
Trying to use it.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.603
Really?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.838
Man!

09:33.840 --> 09:36.808
Y-you just want to warn me
about identity theft?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.644
Because I'll make sure to
check on my credit and stuff.

09:39.646 --> 09:42.013
Good. You do that.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.882
But... Aren't you
a little curious

09:43.884 --> 09:45.650
Who had it?

09:45.652 --> 09:48.153
Well, I'm not
gonna press charges.
Well...

09:48.155 --> 09:49.988
Yeah, but we have to,

09:49.990 --> 09:51.690
'cause tyler
wilkes is dead.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.059
Dead? Well, I didn't
kill... I...

09:54.061 --> 09:56.061
I mean, who?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.630
You're a fast learner, luke,

09:58.632 --> 10:00.599
But if you lie again...

10:00.601 --> 10:03.868
That bunch of trouble's
gonna come from more
than just your chief.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.838
It was blackmail, man.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.307
Wilkes said if
I loaned him my I.D.,

10:09.309 --> 10:10.842
He'd keep me
out of his story.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.876
About the drugs?

10:11.878 --> 10:14.012
Whoa. I just
transferred to norfolk.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.914
I don't know anything
about that.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.816
Wilkes needed your
I.D. For a reason.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.050
We look alike.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.919
He said he wanted
to get into our barracks

10:20.921 --> 10:22.787
For research.
Research on what?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.222
I don't know.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.757
Honestly.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.292
But you can't tell the guys.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.761
When they found out someone had
been going through their stuff,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.096
They were angry enough
as it was.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.931
Angry enough to kill?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.403
(quiet, indistinct conversation)

10:41.674 --> 10:42.674
(ziva sighs)

10:42.676 --> 10:44.409
What's going on?
You tell me.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.244
I came in,
and they were all together.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.680
I told agent dorneget
to bring in

10:48.682 --> 10:50.682
Grismer's roommates one by one.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.652
I'm not sure he knew
we meant separately.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.121
Well, maybe they
haven't had

10:56.123 --> 10:57.756
The chance to get their
story straight yet.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.158
Soldier:
If this is about some jerk
reporter going through

11:00.160 --> 11:01.726
Our quarters, we don't
know anything.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.995
And we don't care
what grismer told you.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.830
(ziva sighs)

11:05.832 --> 11:07.232
Grismer's the only one
missing, right?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.334
So much for that.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.703
Petty officer kelso,
you the leader

11:11.705 --> 11:13.138
Of this, uh,
little gang?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.739
Yeah, sure. So what?

11:14.741 --> 11:16.074
So, that makes you
the lead suspect

11:16.076 --> 11:18.076
In the murder of tyler wilkes.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.415
Told you...

11:23.417 --> 11:26.885
Kelso:
But if the guy's dead,
I guess we're not

11:26.887 --> 11:28.186
Losing sleep, right?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.054
All:
Right.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.088
Wilkes was trying to

11:30.090 --> 11:32.323
Embarrass the navy
with his story.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.925
So you knew
what the story was about?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.093
Don't you?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.795
Gibbs: Well, I got
a good idea.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.899
Drugs.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.803
Not gonna let anyone
smear the navy.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.373
I don't care
who talks.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.808
I want answers.

11:49.810 --> 11:50.875
Fine.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.043
I killed wilkes.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.179
Soldier 2:
No, I killed him.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.280
It was me.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.748
I did it.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.251
Seems you have a problem.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.420
Mcgee:
Boss, what do you
want us to do?

12:02.422 --> 12:03.755
We can't arrest all of them.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.756
Why not?

12:04.758 --> 12:06.858
They confessed.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.161
Put them in the
holding cell...

12:10.163 --> 12:12.897
Until we can arrange a transfer.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.766
That room's only meant
for one person.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.968
Well, perhaps by morning,
they'll be willing to talk.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.737
Is that legal?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.205
(soldiers whispering
indistinctly)

12:20.207 --> 12:22.207
So, what do you think?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.875
Will they go quietly?

12:23.877 --> 12:28.346
I was already planning on doing
some light cardio tonight.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.384
Good workout, gus.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.086
Sorry about the nose.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.121
(chuckles)

12:36.123 --> 12:38.189
(car engine starts)

12:39.291 --> 12:42.494
(hebrew pop song
playing over earphone)

12:57.810 --> 13:00.011
(chuckles)

13:01.881 --> 13:03.314
No kiss for your father?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.916
What are you doing here?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.218
Come. Let's go for a drive.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.287
(sighs)

13:17.429 --> 13:20.565
Eli:
<i>Someday you must give me</i>
<i>a proper tour of your city.</i>

13:20.567 --> 13:22.267
Perhaps when
it is warmer.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.068
Where is your
protection?

13:24.070 --> 13:26.938
They've usually given
themselves away by now.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.874
That is why they do not know
I am in the country.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.811
No one knows.
You're the director
of mossad, <i>abba.</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:34.078
That is impossible.
(laughs)
ziva,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.548
Nothing is impossible,
only difficult.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.982
Which makes this officially
the stupidest thing

13:37.984 --> 13:38.983
You've ever done.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.218
Which is saying something.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.921
Don't you remember the
last time you were here?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.290
Yes. You said, "sometimes,
life surprises you."

13:45.292 --> 13:46.591
Surprise.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.927
What is your business here?

13:48.929 --> 13:51.162
My daughter has made
no effort to visit me

13:51.164 --> 13:52.964
In the last two years,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.433
So I must go to her.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.368
I am here for you, ziva.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.037
(sighs)

13:59.039 --> 14:00.438
How long have you been here?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.273
I arrived this morning,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.609
But waited until I knew
you were alone.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.845
What if someone saw you?

14:06.847 --> 14:07.946
(scoffs)
at your gym?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.380
At all.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.549
Surely you still have enemies
that want you dead.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.450
You think?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.152
(chuckles)
ziva...

14:14.154 --> 14:16.487
I do not walk straight lines.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.956
As your agent gibbs
would say,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.625
"this is not
my first radio."
rodeo.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.993
You could have
at least called.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.862
I did not want to be refused.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.865
There's no other reason
for your visit?

14:26.867 --> 14:29.868
(sighs)

14:29.870 --> 14:31.970
I promise you...

14:31.972 --> 14:33.938
My intentions are honorable.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.940
No one will know I was here.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.378
Now, I have answered
all your questions.

14:40.380 --> 14:44.082
(speaking hebrew)

14:50.990 --> 14:53.057
(sighs)

14:56.562 --> 14:58.296
(electronic music playing)

14:59.965 --> 15:01.466
Whoa.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.001
Trippy.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.139
Abby?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.641
Gibbs!

15:09.643 --> 15:10.909
Look what mcgee found!

15:10.911 --> 15:12.176
It's my spy glasses

15:12.178 --> 15:13.344
From the first time
I went undercover.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.048
Well, you never forget
your first time.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.050
A lot's changed since then, huh?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.319
Yeah, some things haven't.
What do you got?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.521
Um, dna and fingerprint samples

15:23.523 --> 15:25.290
From our holding-cell four.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.691
Our clique of
confessed murderers

15:26.693 --> 15:28.993
Are getting ripe
and restless.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.028
Gibbs:
Victim's apartment?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.296
Yeah, no sign
of a break-in

15:31.298 --> 15:32.463
Or a struggle.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.965
Hmm, don't have
a crime scene yet.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.199
Yeah, or much
else, either.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.035
I mean,
wilkes owns a cell phone,

15:37.037 --> 15:38.536
A tablet computer,
a bunch of

15:38.538 --> 15:41.205
High-end cameras,
and... They're missing.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.307
Or destroyed.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.574
Could be our best
shot to linking

15:43.576 --> 15:45.576
The murder to our
stinky suspects.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.412
Got a bolo on wilkes's car?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.280
Uh, we're still
waiting for a hit.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.984
Can I borrow gibbs
for just a moment?

15:52.986 --> 15:55.653
Okay, but bring him back
when you're through.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.101
Hmm.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.502
(elevator shuts off)

16:11.504 --> 16:13.004
What's up, ziva?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.340
My father's in town.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.242
He came to see me
last night.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.377
Alone.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.246
Even his own people
do not know he's here.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.315
I know it sounds bad,
and this is the last thing

16:24.317 --> 16:25.717
You want to deal with, but I...

16:27.519 --> 16:29.754
...I did not want
to hide anything from you.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.189
Why's he here?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.691
Spend time with me.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.161
Or so he says.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.766
I know it sounds silly
when I say it out loud.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.134
Not silly.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.335
But suspect.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.170
What do you want me to do?

16:46.172 --> 16:48.072
Spend time with your father.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.074
Really?

16:50.076 --> 16:51.676
And keep me updated.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.611
Of course.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.214
Until we know for sure
what he's up to.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.518
(elevator starts)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.453
Are you going to tell
the director?

17:05.424 --> 17:06.724
(intercom beeps)

17:06.726 --> 17:08.760
Woman: Director,
I have your wife for you.

17:08.762 --> 17:13.031
Jackie:
So, this is why you had to
be in the office so early?

17:13.033 --> 17:16.401
Garfield ship nermal
to the kremlin again?

17:16.403 --> 17:18.603
Lasagna shortage in damascus.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.171
(chuckles)

17:20.173 --> 17:21.406
What are you doing here?

17:21.408 --> 17:24.275
You left before we could
talk this morning.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.643
Well, you could have
just called.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.146
True, but if I had
told your assistant

17:28.148 --> 17:31.449
That the kids are spending the
night at a friend's tonight

17:31.451 --> 17:34.552
And we have the whole
house to ourselves,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.422
She might have
misunderstood.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.091
And you didn't want that message
to get lost in translation.

17:40.093 --> 17:45.096
Plus, I wanted to personally
convey the importance.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.465
What's the occasion?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.833
Us.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.135
I'll clear my schedule.
(sultry laugh)

17:51.137 --> 17:53.171
(phone ringing, vance grunts)

17:56.542 --> 17:59.177
Better put out a memo.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.146
Yeah?

18:02.148 --> 18:04.715
Shmeil lives outside

18:04.717 --> 18:07.618
Of tel aviv now,
in senior-living apartments.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.121
But based on his level
of energy, and his, um,

18:10.123 --> 18:13.091
Tolerance for alcohol,
you'd never know he's retired.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.493
The old man has not changed.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.594
(laughs)

18:16.596 --> 18:20.231
He's no fan of yours.
Uh...

18:20.233 --> 18:22.233
My fans become fewer by the day.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.439
Now, this is what retirement
should look like.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.209
That-that was not supposed
to be there.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.177
I was... Undercover.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.545
It's very convincing.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.382
Did you mean <i>your</i> retirement?

18:39.351 --> 18:41.819
Ah, ziva.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.122
The world is changing.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.790
And what about you?

18:45.792 --> 18:50.361
You have disagreed with many of
my past decisions as a father,

18:50.363 --> 18:53.197
And I have always hoped
to make up for it

18:53.199 --> 18:55.666
When I am free
from this responsibility.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.475
But judging from the way
you are looking at me,

19:04.477 --> 19:07.245
Perhaps my sins are too great.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.247
I think you're confusing
retiring with repenting.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.383
Only the latter
makes any difference to me.

19:12.385 --> 19:17.722
Then let this visit be
a first step to my redemption.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.628
Was it a boy or girl?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.829
It was not real.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.697
I know, but what did you
tell people

19:26.699 --> 19:27.832
When they asked you?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.838
I said it was a girl.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.878
Vance: <i>What the hell's</i>
<i>he really doing here, gibbs?</i>

19:41.713 --> 19:44.215
Thought you'd have an idea.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.950
I do. I don't like it.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.820
Word at state has been
eli's on his way out at mossad.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.756
Political climate's
changing in israel,

19:51.758 --> 19:53.424
Eli's too old-school.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.659
They're looking for
accountability.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.928
As they should.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.597
World's one incident away
from nuclear war.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.466
Is eli david poking
the bear with a stick--

20:02.468 --> 20:03.734
Including me.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.269
Thought you two
were buddies.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.539
I'm just asking him
for his car keys.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.974
Won't go quietly.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.311
That's what got me worried
about this little visit.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.846
I was just on with a friend
at homeland security.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.683
I asked about any high-level
threats in the capitol.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.817
They know about eli?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.220
No. He's flying
under everybody's radar.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.288
But another name popped up.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.459
Arash kazmi's in town.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.961
Gibbs:
Iranian intelligence.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.296
Vance:
Eli's new vevak contemporary.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.398
The two of them grew up
on different sides

20:34.400 --> 20:36.801
Of the same stretch
of the israel-palestine border.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.569
Kazmi moved to tehran
when he was nine.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.870
What's he doing in dc?

20:39.872 --> 20:43.241
Stopover on his way back
from the un council.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.309
Kazmi's first visit to the u.S.,

20:45.311 --> 20:47.812
Eli just happens to be here.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.648
Director david wants to prove
that he's still an asset.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.984
By taking out
a high-level target.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.253
Quickly
and quietly, gibbs.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.723
You know you want to
ride shotgun, leon.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.791
You gotta call it.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.262
Shotgun.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.301
(phone keypad beeping)

21:12.337 --> 21:15.039
You have been playing with
your phone all afternoon.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.475
A new boyfriend you
have not told me about

21:17.477 --> 21:19.477
Or could it be
business-related?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.479
Vance:
With you, it's always business.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.714
Leon, my old friend.

21:24.750 --> 21:25.916
A little bird must have

21:25.918 --> 21:27.318
Told you of my visit.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.519
Can't blame her.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.888
On the contrary, agent gibbs.
I counted on

21:30.890 --> 21:33.424
My daughter's
loyalty to you.

21:33.426 --> 21:37.995
You do not know as much
as you think you do.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.364
Won't let you kill him, eli.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.600
I should hope not.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.009
You're late.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.014
Please...

21:57.016 --> 21:58.883
Won't you
all come in?

22:10.830 --> 22:15.333
But, uh, we do not
have much time.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.002
Thank you for
coming, director.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.005
They think I'm here to kill you.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.007
A misunderstanding, I hope.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.077
Otherwise, I have
made a grave mistake

22:26.079 --> 22:28.579
In eluding my
security detail.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.515
I believe you...
Owe me something.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.784
Ah, yes.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.120
Uh-uh.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.923
(eli chuckles)

22:43.061 --> 22:44.628
Eli:
Merely...

22:44.630 --> 22:45.830
An olive branch.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.033
Or rather its fruit.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.901
Thank you. Huh?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.870
(eli chuckles)

22:55.607 --> 22:56.774
Mmm.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.775
Mmm, mmm.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.110
What is going on?

22:59.112 --> 23:00.644
That's a damn good question.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.012
Eli:
My apologizes, leon,

23:02.014 --> 23:04.148
But I knew you would
never agree to this meeting

23:04.150 --> 23:06.417
Or even believe
that it was possible.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.952
Not without bloodshed.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.021
We are here to
prove otherwise.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.592
Mmm.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.127
A taste of home.

23:16.129 --> 23:19.063
Arash and I grew up on opposite
sides of the orchard

23:19.065 --> 23:20.831
Where these olives
were grown--

23:20.833 --> 23:23.000
The israeli-palestine border.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.003
Neither side claimed the land,
so as children, we both

23:26.005 --> 23:27.538
Picked the fruit.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.140
Kazmi:
He was taller
than I was

23:29.142 --> 23:33.177
And always managed to reach
the better harvest.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.714
Borders have since changed...
As have allegiances.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.182
Temperaments have not.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.851
Israel remains too entitled.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.621
Iran cannot force its
will upon the world.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.955
Vance:
Not exactly inspiring

23:44.957 --> 23:46.891
A chorus of "kumbaya."

23:46.893 --> 23:48.893
We agree on very
little, but...

23:48.895 --> 23:52.696
We recognize the need
for this kind of open

23:52.698 --> 23:53.898
And honest dialogue.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.599
Eli: Even if our
governments do not.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.901
They don't.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.736
Eli:
Which is why

23:58.738 --> 24:00.771
We have risked
our lives

24:00.773 --> 24:02.873
To make this possible.

24:02.875 --> 24:07.111
If either of our nations knew,
we would both be dead.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.115
So why do you need me?

24:11.117 --> 24:14.785
You are aware that my position
in mossad is uncertain.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.088
I know this because you have
stopped taking my calls.

24:19.724 --> 24:22.226
You were always
the better politician.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.061
And you want me
to use those skills

24:24.063 --> 24:25.529
To make sure you stay in power.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.467
Not asking much, are you, eli?

24:29.469 --> 24:31.502
Kazmi: This could be
the difference

24:31.504 --> 24:32.837
Between war...

24:32.839 --> 24:34.705
Or not.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.008
Leon, my friend...

24:40.912 --> 24:43.848
...You and I were forged
in blood,

24:43.850 --> 24:46.750
But peace can be our legacy.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.523
I'll do what I can.

24:57.128 --> 24:58.829
Thank you.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.731
I must go.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.166
My absence will be noticed.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.133
Of course.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.504
(lock clicks open)

25:06.506 --> 25:09.073
(door opens)

25:17.549 --> 25:19.049
(lock clicks)

25:19.051 --> 25:21.085
I'm not sure what just happened.

25:22.053 --> 25:24.255
That makes two of us.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.557
The first step to redemption.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.627
(phone ringing)

25:32.097 --> 25:34.064
Yeah, mcgee.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.733
Mcgee:
We found our victim's car

25:35.735 --> 25:38.068
In an off-airport
parking lot at reagan.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.738
No video security and
airlines have no record

25:40.740 --> 25:43.607
Of anyone flying under the names
wilkes or grismer.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.209
Based on the broken
driver's-side window

25:45.211 --> 25:47.011
And the victim's
blood on the floor,

25:47.013 --> 25:49.547
The fight started
at the parked car.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.681
We got our crime scene.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.082
Abby:
That's not all we got.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.818
We also found
all of the victim's stuff,

25:54.820 --> 25:56.887
Including his camera.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.023
Unfortunately, the memory card
was wiped clean.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.191
Likely the work of
whoever killed wilkes.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.826
Abby:
But what the killer
didn't know

26:02.828 --> 26:05.029
Is that the memory card
is wi-fi enabled.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.730
That a good thing?
Mcgee:
The memory card

26:06.732 --> 26:08.165
Automatically
uploads photographs

26:08.167 --> 26:09.300
To the user's phone--

26:09.302 --> 26:11.168
Or, in this case, the tablet

26:11.170 --> 26:12.570
We found under the backseat--

26:12.572 --> 26:14.338
Using a wi-fi or
cellular signal.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.306
Auto backup.

26:15.308 --> 26:18.976
The photos the victim took
before he was killed.

26:18.978 --> 26:22.212
Mcgee:
No clear shot of the face, but
it's definitely the same person.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.315
We could be looking at why
wilkes didn't get on that plane.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.750
Mcgee: Or maybe the
killer himself.
Got an I.D.?

26:26.752 --> 26:29.019
Abby: Uh, all we've got
so far is his coat

26:29.021 --> 26:30.821
And his... Hat,

26:30.823 --> 26:34.224
Sold at... Probably every
department store everywhere

26:34.226 --> 26:35.826
And impossible to track.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.362
But we'll try.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.297
Do it.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.600
(door closes)

26:42.602 --> 26:44.234
Hey! (chuckles)

26:44.236 --> 26:46.236
You're home early.

26:46.238 --> 26:49.607
I haven't even had time
to put dinner in the oven.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.008
Or change clothes.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.348
You have to work late?

26:58.316 --> 27:00.618
No, no, I'll be home for dinner.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.952
But...

27:01.954 --> 27:03.988
Is that wine kosher?

27:07.058 --> 27:09.126
What's eli doing here?

27:11.196 --> 27:12.863
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.132
But he and I need to
talk unofficially.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.102
Beltway burger on 36th
has a drive-through.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.371
But it doesn't
have you.

27:21.272 --> 27:24.174
Or your mother's recipe
for baked chicken.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.046
(sighs)

27:31.316 --> 27:32.950
It's important.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.219
Always is.

27:36.187 --> 27:39.056
What time's dinner?

27:39.058 --> 27:41.191
Sundown.
Okay.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.430
Thank you.
Yeah.

27:48.334 --> 27:52.703
We'll still have the house to
ourselves after dinner, right?

27:52.705 --> 27:55.439
You had your shot, baby.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.676
Hm.

28:02.313 --> 28:05.015
Been digging through
wilkes' tablet, boss.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.018
Found a draft of his latest
story, explains his mo.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.220
Let's hear it.
Well,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.723
Our shady reporter was using
the look-alike I.D.

28:12.725 --> 28:15.359
To fly standby
on military cargo planes.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.294
Wilkes, posing
as grismer,

28:17.296 --> 28:19.229
Was supposed to get on a flight
the day he was killed.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.798
But the mystery hat guy

28:20.800 --> 28:23.133
Is not one of our
"I am spartacus" quartet.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.970
Our petty officers had already
reported back to norfolk.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.806
Yeah? Why'd they lie?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.809
Um... Wilkes' story details
the drug addiction

28:31.811 --> 28:33.410
Of a former rack mate.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.745
He's already getting treatment.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.146
The navy knows
about the drugs.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.249
Our fab four figured
if wilkes was already dead,

28:39.251 --> 28:43.053
Didn't want to be the ones
to bring it up again.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.222
So they copped
to the murder instead.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.790
Not sure if that's
loyal or stupid.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.959
It's both. Cut 'em loose.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.163
Did you change clothes?

28:53.165 --> 28:54.832
I have a dinner date.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.366
Shabbat dinner?

28:56.368 --> 29:00.437
But I have no idea what
or who you are talking about.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.240
Just tell him
"agent meatball" says hi.
(chuckles)

29:03.242 --> 29:05.943
He would not be joking with you
if he did not like you, tony.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.444
Believe me.

29:09.848 --> 29:10.814
What is that?

29:11.382 --> 29:13.250
Tony:
Wilkes' killer.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.418
Sort of.

29:16.054 --> 29:16.920
Why? Did we miss something?

29:19.758 --> 29:20.758
Ziva...

29:21.526 --> 29:23.093
It's nothing.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.463
We're here if you need us.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.268
(elevator bell chimes)

29:41.946 --> 29:45.482
You have been very quiet.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.552
Do you want to tell me what
has changed since this morning?

29:54.259 --> 29:56.326
Wait.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.299
Did you lie about when you
arrived in the country?

30:03.268 --> 30:05.302
What is this about?

30:07.505 --> 30:09.239
Ziva:
The truth.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.308
Ziva, the truth has many faces.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.178
Tell me about this one.

30:18.583 --> 30:22.419
I wanted you
in that room today, ziva.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.854
More than vance.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.290
Wilkes recognized you and

30:26.292 --> 30:28.425
Started taking pictures
of you, did he not?

30:28.427 --> 30:31.929
I wanted to put an end to
your perpetual suspicion of me.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.530
So you followed him to the car
and you took his camera.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.965
I wanted you
to look at me

30:34.967 --> 30:38.468
Like you did
when you were a child.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.004
With pride.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.607
I saw that briefly today.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.475
He fought back.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.944
It was an accident.

30:46.946 --> 30:50.013
But you knew if word got out
that you were here,

30:50.015 --> 30:52.616
It would ruin everything
you came to do.

30:52.618 --> 30:55.018
I came to show you the good.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.553
I needed to protect that.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.956
An innocent
man is dead.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.124
You disposed of his body,

31:01.126 --> 31:03.126
And you lied about it.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.328
Yes, I did.

31:05.598 --> 31:10.000
Why is that the only part
of this that you can see?

31:10.002 --> 31:12.469
Because you were right.

31:14.572 --> 31:16.607
Your sins are too great.

31:17.575 --> 31:19.643
Ah.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.215
So be it.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.486
But will you please...

31:29.488 --> 31:32.923
Sit across from me
at the dinner table

31:32.925 --> 31:35.893
One last time?

31:39.030 --> 31:41.665
Thanks.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.901
Here you go.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.969
No, thank you.

31:52.110 --> 31:55.946
You have gone out of your way
in welcoming me, jackie.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.915
The candles, the meal.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.683
Truly a shabbat feast.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.251
Jackie:
The magic of internet

32:01.253 --> 32:02.686
Research.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.554
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.659
You even have the challah.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.227
Store-bought since

32:10.229 --> 32:11.628
This was all last minute.

32:13.031 --> 32:15.999
I have caused you trouble.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.472
To clean slates.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.042
For all of us.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.711
Eli:
Forgive me, leon, but

32:27.713 --> 32:29.446
The blessing before we drink.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.582
Oh, uh, it's hard
to keep it all straight.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.952
No, no, no. Ziva used to

32:34.954 --> 32:37.621
Say the same thing
when she was young.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.691
But the purpose
of these traditions is

32:40.693 --> 32:44.661
To always remind us
of what god has given.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.531
Life, freedom

32:47.533 --> 32:48.632
And family.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.701
(scoffs)

33:00.345 --> 33:01.745
(keypad beeping)

33:01.747 --> 33:03.146
(line ringing)

33:03.148 --> 33:04.314
(sighs)

33:04.316 --> 33:05.649
Ziva.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.485
My father killed tyler wilkes.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.252
(rapid gunfire)
oh!

33:13.658 --> 33:15.058
Gibbs (over phone):
Ziva!

33:15.060 --> 33:17.060
(tires squealing)

33:17.062 --> 33:19.129
(engine revving)

33:32.710 --> 33:34.578
Federal agent! Stop!

33:37.348 --> 33:38.448
(car door closes)

33:38.450 --> 33:40.650
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

33:41.753 --> 33:45.255
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

33:48.192 --> 33:49.393
(grunting)

33:49.395 --> 33:50.694
(tires squealing)

33:50.696 --> 33:53.697
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

33:56.667 --> 33:58.368
(engine revving)

33:59.737 --> 34:01.138
(tires squealing)

34:02.807 --> 34:04.141
(dog barking)

34:04.143 --> 34:06.243
Hands in the air!

34:08.646 --> 34:10.647
(phone ringing)

34:10.649 --> 34:12.716
Gibbs.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.317
What happened?
Ziva:
I do not know.

34:14.319 --> 34:15.485
I saw the shooter
and went after him.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.620
Get back to the house.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.388
The shooter is wounded, gibbs.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.356
I'm not gonna lose him.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.524
I'm coming to you.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.725
(tires squealing)

34:23.694 --> 34:26.797
(tires squealing)

34:29.167 --> 34:30.734
Mcgee:
Tony.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.802
Call an ambulance.

34:34.839 --> 34:36.440
(tires screech)

34:36.442 --> 34:37.674
(sirens approaching)

34:37.676 --> 34:39.309
You okay?

34:39.311 --> 34:41.478
I'm fine.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.114
He's not.

34:48.119 --> 34:50.120
Gibbs:
Stopped to rest.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.422
When a wounded animal
has lost too much blood,

34:52.424 --> 34:54.191
It knows it can no longer run.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.792
Yeah, so he hides.
Yeah.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.429
(sirens approaching)

35:04.569 --> 35:06.636
(whispers):
Got blood.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.712
Director vance?

35:15.714 --> 35:17.347
Vance:
Dinozzo.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.318
You're bleeding.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.320
It's not mine.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.188
I need more towels!

35:25.190 --> 35:26.356
(helicopter approaching)

35:26.358 --> 35:29.226
Vance:
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.497
(helicopter hovering)

35:33.499 --> 35:35.499
(labored breathing)

35:35.501 --> 35:37.267
Gibbs:
Federal agents!

35:37.269 --> 35:38.869
Ziva:
We know you're in there!
We're coming in!

35:38.871 --> 35:41.505
Keep your hands
where we can see them!

35:41.507 --> 35:43.440
(forcing door open)

35:43.442 --> 35:44.708
(door squeaking)

35:44.710 --> 35:46.243
(sighs)

35:47.512 --> 35:49.513
Hands!

35:49.515 --> 35:52.782
I did not expect you
to come after me.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.818
Rather than checking
on your father.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.286
What about him?

35:56.288 --> 35:58.221
Who are you?

35:58.223 --> 36:00.924
A man with one last job to do.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.759
Do you have a light?

36:02.761 --> 36:05.428
There's poison
in the cigarette.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.596
Gibbs:
Spit it out.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.764
(groaning)

36:07.766 --> 36:09.166
Put him on the side.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.767
Get him on his side.
Don't die.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.335
Don't... Die!

36:12.337 --> 36:13.770
Don't... Die.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.372
(ziva grunts)

36:16.807 --> 36:18.408
(grunting):
Ben kelev.
Hey!

36:18.410 --> 36:20.577
That's enough. Let's go.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.579
(siren blaring)

36:22.581 --> 36:24.381
(indistinct chatter)

36:24.383 --> 36:25.649
(tires screech)

36:25.651 --> 36:27.284
Mcgee.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.952
The director just left
in the ambulance.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.921
He's okay,
but mrs. Vance was hit.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.222
Not sure how bad.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.791
What about my father?

36:37.261 --> 36:40.297
Mcgee...

36:42.266 --> 36:44.334
(siren whoops)

36:54.545 --> 36:56.880
No.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.622
<i>Abba!</i>

37:07.892 --> 37:09.993
<i>Abba...!</i>

37:17.335 --> 37:19.402
(crying)

37:25.610 --> 37:27.978
Who did this?

37:27.980 --> 37:30.981
(ziva sobbing)

37:32.817 --> 37:34.951
(praying in hebrew)

37:38.990 --> 37:40.924
(ziva continues
praying in hebrew)

37:47.865 --> 37:49.933
(praying in hebrew)

38:14.525 --> 38:17.594
(phone ringing)

38:19.430 --> 38:21.431
(beeps)

38:21.433 --> 38:23.500
(siren wails in distance)

38:34.912 --> 38:36.980
Any word on mrs. Vance?

38:36.982 --> 38:38.915
Still in surgery.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.517
Oh.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.352
It's been two hours.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.690
He hasn't moved.

38:46.692 --> 38:49.059
He hasn't answered
his phone, either.

38:49.061 --> 38:51.795
Secnav's started calling me.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.630
Did you answer?
No.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.332
I didn't know what to tell him.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.767
He wasn't supposed
to know eli david was in town.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.804
No one was.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.606
You know, if the wrong people
found out what happened,

39:03.608 --> 39:06.376
This could be taken
as a declaration of war.

39:06.378 --> 39:07.944
Maybe that's what it is.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.646
Israel-iran.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.548
U.S.-Iran.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.016
U.S.-Israel.

39:20.725 --> 39:22.025
Tony?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.396
We came as soon
as we heard.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.036
Ah.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.506
Let's wait
in the lobby.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.842
Good idea.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.523
(sighs)

39:53.525 --> 39:55.392
(phone ringing)

39:59.397 --> 40:01.998
(beep)

40:02.000 --> 40:05.068
(phone beeps off,
snaps shut)

40:08.706 --> 40:11.875
Leon?

40:14.678 --> 40:16.746
She's dead.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.817
My wife is dead, gibbs.
