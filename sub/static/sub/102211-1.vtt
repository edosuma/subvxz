Oh, my God, Father.
To be on fleek is no more.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.885

Tell me, Semmi,
this urgent matter--

does it concern
my marriage to a suitor

21:27.787 --> 21:29.080
from getting my, uh,
business degree,

21:29.163 --> 21:30.915
but then my mom got laid off,
and, uh,

21:30.999 --> 21:33.626

drop out to help with the rent.

where I didn't see

21:49.142 --> 21:52.228

and, uh, it can be hard.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.440

21:55.523 --> 21:57.900
that not having
a dominant male figure at home,

21:57.984 --> 22:00.028
it's so detrimental to a child.

22:10.913 --> 22:15.418
that kind of male role model
could put you at a disadvantage?

22:15.501 --> 22:18.629

than having a father

22:18.713 --> 22:20.673

an Ivy League school?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.641

22:30.725 --> 22:33.519
Well, there was
a small off-campus library.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.064
And Daddy never
had to sneak you into

22:36.147 --> 22:38.024

22:38.107 --> 22:40.109

a cocaine addiction, Calvin?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.403

I am so motivated.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.499
Those hungry babies
with the flies on their face.

-SAUL: Whoa, whoa.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.711
CLARENCE: That's too much, man.
You stepped over the line, now.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.212
We don't be talking that kind
of shit about the hungry babies.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.256
You gonna have to get out my
chair talking that kind of shit.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.674
Politically incorrect.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.467
Somebody need to whip your ass.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.511
Mm-hmm.
Get up and whip him, Sweets.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.305
Hey, don't be putting the money
in my hand all rough.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.806
Take your ass out of here.
You buy you a Flowbee

24:33.890 --> 24:35.433
and cut your own damn hair
from now on.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.977
Right now I could rip
a new ass in that kid.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.103
It is so good to see you.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.105
Your neighborhood
seems to be thriving.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.273
Oh, that's that gentrification.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.941
You know,
when the colored man here,

24:44.025 --> 24:45.276
this neighborhood
didn't have shit.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.986
When the white man move in,

24:47.069 --> 24:49.447
they got their coffeehouses
and their dog parks,

24:49.530 --> 24:53.159
and my brownstone on Foch
Boulevard is worth $10 million.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.828
Your brownstone ain't worth
no ten million.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.538
-My brownstone is, too, worth
$10 million! -(Morris laughs)

24:57.622 --> 25:00.166
And I'm gonna sell it
and get me a Tesla.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.959
America has certainly changed
since our last visit.

25:02.043 --> 25:05.880
Your Black president finally
united this great country.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.590
Yeah, but it's all
gone to hell now.

It's gonna be the Nazis.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.471
Nazis are back,

25:13.554 --> 25:16.224
but now they dress
like the Best Buy Geek Squad

25:16.307 --> 25:18.351

25:18.434 --> 25:21.896
Anybody could be a Nazi.
You ever notice that, Prince?

25:21.979 --> 25:23.814
Akeem now is an African king.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.066
CLARENCE:
Well, I'll be damned.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.735
You got any kids? I got kids.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.947
In fact, I got one granddaughter
used to be my grandson.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.407
They can turn your penis
into a vagina now.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.785
It's science.

y'all got in Africa.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.957
You can't even
squeeze a tit nowadays.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.291
It'll get you fired.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.418
I'm so sorry you can
no longer indiscriminately

25:44.502 --> 25:46.545
touch a woman's body
at your every whim.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.006
Oh, it's okay.

I have just discovered
that I may have a bastard son

26:10.736 --> 26:12.280
The king pays no child support.

No child support for 30 years,

differently,

I make him a prince,

and this is how he repays me!

1:18:30.623 --> 1:18:34.168

But, no, instead he runs off

unworthy of a Joffer!

1:19:03.573 --> 1:19:06.367

1:19:06.451 --> 1:19:10.079
including making babies

1:19:10.163 --> 1:19:14.250
that you don't know
anything about.

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:16.669
Right now you are getting

Are you trying to say
I'm out of pocket?

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.883
What I am saying is, when a
person is drunk, they may say

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:23.426
-something that they regret...
-So, whenever a woman

1:19:23.509 --> 1:19:24.927
speaks her mind, including
our daughter, then you just...

1:19:25.011 --> 1:19:26.220
...so I suggest
you mind your tongue!

1:19:29.974 --> 1:19:32.018
What happened to you, Akeem?

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:36.063
You were supposed to
change things.

1:19:36.147 --> 1:19:39.525
You were supposed to bring this
kingdom to the 21st century,

1:19:39.609 --> 1:19:43.946
but instead,
you push our daughter aside,

1:19:44.030 --> 1:19:49.035
someone who has dedicated
her life to this country.

1:19:49.118 --> 1:19:51.621
And because she's a woman,

1:19:51.704 --> 1:19:53.915
she can't be your heir?

1:19:53.998 --> 1:19:57.001
I cannot ignore
hundreds of years of tradition.

1:19:57.084 --> 1:19:58.669

1:20:08.262 --> 1:20:10.431
You're the king.

1:20:10.515 --> 1:20:12.642
Well, I'll tell you what.

1:20:12.725 --> 1:20:15.770
There are a lot of other beds
in this castle.

1:20:16.771 --> 1:20:19.982
I suggest you find another one.

1:20:20.066 --> 1:20:24.362
Would you dare banish me
from my own bedroom?

1:20:24.445 --> 1:20:26.155
Are you a fool?

It was simple,
and it made sense.

1:21:23.004 --> 1:21:25.923
Every day, I have moved
closer to the comfort of life,

1:21:26.007 --> 1:21:28.050
and now my eyes are open,

1:21:28.134 --> 1:21:29.969
and the man that
I always wanted to be

1:21:30.052 --> 1:21:31.679
is on the other side
of the world.

1:21:31.762 --> 1:21:33.306
Lavelle.

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:36.892
Yes, he has fleed to America
for love just as I did.

1:21:36.976 --> 1:21:38.728
And now,
because of my stubbornness,

1:21:38.811 --> 1:21:40.771
I have run off my own son.

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:43.774
Failed him as a father.

1:21:43.858 --> 1:21:46.402
You're not just a father.

1:21:46.485 --> 1:21:48.112
You're the king.

1:21:48.195 --> 1:21:51.198
And heavy lies the head
that wears the crown.

1:21:51.282 --> 1:21:53.993
Yes, I understand
that expression more now.

1:21:54.076 --> 1:21:56.537
It's not so much the crown
that is so heavy.

1:21:56.621 --> 1:22:00.041
It's everything
that comes with it. Hmm?

1:22:00.124 --> 1:22:01.834
You've got your country to run

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:04.754
and a crazy-ass general
breathing down your neck.

1:22:04.837 --> 1:22:06.672
And on top of all that,

1:22:06.756 --> 1:22:09.508
you got to be
a husband and a father.

1:22:09.592 --> 1:22:11.719
Yes, you can see
that is most troubling.

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:13.512
-Oh, I get it.
-Of course you get it.

1:22:13.596 --> 1:22:15.598
You are the king
of your own castle.

1:22:15.681 --> 1:22:18.100

We put our toppings
on the bottom.

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:38.371

my goddamn feet!"
