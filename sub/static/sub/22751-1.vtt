00:43.144 --> 00:45.544
excuse me, can you
lend me a pencil?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.446
I do not have, sorry.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.081
This is my stop!

00:49.083 --> 00:51.216
Sorry!

00:51.218 --> 00:52.518
It happened my stop!

00:54.855 --> 00:56.288
Sorry!

00:56.290 --> 00:57.389
It happened my stop!

01:00.961 --> 01:02.094
You have to open the door.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.234
Why do not you open the door?

01:18.145 --> 01:20.212
Open the door! Open
the door, now!

01:26.754 --> 01:29.855
Please, open the door!

01:29.857 --> 01:32.458
Why do not you open it?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.625
Help me!

01:35.996 --> 01:37.096
Abrala!

01:37.098 --> 01:39.765
Why does not it help us?
God please!

01:56.117 --> 01:57.483
Someone help me!

01:59.687 --> 02:01.987
Please, god, help us!

02:12.366 --> 02:13.465
No no!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.576
What do you want!

02:27.014 --> 02:29.882
Who you are!

02:29.884 --> 02:31.783
Emma, please, you have to stop.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.587
Emma, stop!

02:35.589 --> 02:38.023
Where...? What...? What...?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.027
What do you want?

02:43.664 --> 02:44.997
You have to stop.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.767
Emma, no!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.736
What the hell are you doing?

02:50.738 --> 02:53.038
Do not! No no no!
I'm fine, I'm fine.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.407
I fell asleep without drawing it.
I just need to draw it.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.009
- Nurse!
- Do not.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.043
You know it's for your own good.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.444
No, no, no, please! No no no!

02:59.446 --> 03:01.413
- Nurse!
- No, please, do not do this!

03:01.415 --> 03:02.514
Do not!

03:08.155 --> 03:10.355
Do not! No no!

03:10.357 --> 03:11.490
Please!

03:11.492 --> 03:13.692
Do not do this! No no no no!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.294
- Do it now.
- No no!

03:15.296 --> 03:16.862
Jeremy, tell them! Please!

03:16.864 --> 03:19.131
- No no! Do not understand!
- Stop moving!

03:19.133 --> 03:21.133
Please! Do not!

03:21.135 --> 03:22.601
Then help me understand.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.906
And maybe we can do this
without the sedative.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.911
Do you think a fair proposal?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.087
Agree.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.534
Hi Emma.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.506
Thanks, Dixon, I
think we're fine.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.010
Sir, I do not think
it's a good idea.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.213
We will be fine.
Is not it, Emma?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.855
I'll be outside.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.923
Behave.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.234
I think we have not
had the opportunity

04:29.236 --> 04:30.736
to present ourselves formally.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.870
I'm Dr. fenton...

04:31.872 --> 04:33.605
Where is Dr. Channing?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.173
She knows my file, she
knows what happens

04:35.175 --> 04:38.243
if I fall asleep
without drawing it.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.545
Unfortunately, Dr. Channing's
husband became ill.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.414
She took time to be with him.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.652
I do not get it. He went?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.353
Her husband's
illness was very...

04:48.355 --> 04:50.455
Sudden

04:50.457 --> 04:52.691
she can not do that.
Can not do that!

04:52.693 --> 04:53.859
She has been here
since the beginning!

04:53.861 --> 04:56.228
She knows what happened!
Know what...

04:56.230 --> 04:57.529
It happens to me

04:57.531 --> 04:59.464
it's okay, Dixon, it's okay.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.033
Emma only expressed concern

05:01.035 --> 05:03.735
for the sudden license of Dr.
Channing.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.071
It is totally understandable.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.306
Emma

05:12.246 --> 05:14.046
Emma, this is your decision.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.515
Or you feel

05:16.517 --> 05:18.984
and you help me understand
what you're going through,

05:18.986 --> 05:21.620
or we can sedarte
and start over this

05:21.622 --> 05:22.654
tomorrow morning.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.300
Now, where should we start?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.237
You have my file, decide you.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.441
How about we start with this?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.279
He did not read that, right?

05:47.281 --> 05:49.915
Did not read it out loud?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.116
Do not. Should?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.718
No no no! Can not!

05:52.720 --> 05:55.253
You can never say
your name out loud.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.289
You can never say
your name out loud.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.935
Stickman comes...
Accepting dreams for...

06:09.937 --> 06:11.103
Say your name... I heard...

06:11.105 --> 06:12.304
Until their death stats...

06:16.076 --> 06:17.743
It started when I was ten.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.546
With my sister.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.482
Do not! Do not!

06:23.484 --> 06:25.784
Wake up, honey! Come on!

06:25.786 --> 06:27.052
<i>Nightmares they
were so terrible,</i>

06:27.054 --> 06:28.353
<i>that my older sister Claire,</i>

06:28.355 --> 06:29.721
<i>he hurt himself trying
to defend himself</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:31.323
<i>of what was attacking
her in your dream.</i>

06:31.325 --> 06:32.357
Do not!

06:34.461 --> 06:35.694
He's going to kill me!

06:35.696 --> 06:37.462
<i>My mother saw to all
kinds of doctors,</i>

06:37.464 --> 06:39.097
<i>but none of that served.</i>

06:39.099 --> 06:40.699
Get out of me!

06:47.341 --> 06:49.307
In fact, the night
terrors only worsened.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.078
Come here.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.794
<i>My mother gave her life
trying to save my sister.</i>

07:08.796 --> 07:11.196
Claire, no!

07:11.198 --> 07:12.230
Claire!

07:12.232 --> 07:13.465
<i>Then he took Claire.</i>

07:15.369 --> 07:17.302
<i>911, what is it? Your emergency?</i>

07:17.304 --> 07:18.670
- Mom?
<i>- Hello?</i>

07:18.672 --> 07:19.704
Mom. Mom.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.705
<i>I should have run.</i>

07:20.707 --> 07:22.574
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

07:22.576 --> 07:23.909
I should have run
as far as possible,

07:23.911 --> 07:24.976
but I did not.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.778
Claire Claire

07:36.423 --> 07:40.258
"Stickman comes to
those who sleep,

07:40.260 --> 07:42.994
stalking dreams for
souls to harvest.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.900
Saying your name condemns
whoever hears it.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.138
Those who say it,
invite you to enter,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.806
until on their deathbeds,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.074
your blood can take.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.277
Break that strength, and
he will enter this world.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.514
If I die before waking up..."

08:02.516 --> 08:03.882
What? Do not!

08:03.884 --> 08:05.283
No no!

08:05.285 --> 08:06.551
Mom!

08:06.553 --> 08:07.786
Claire!

08:07.788 --> 08:10.021
"it was stickman
who took my soul."

08:13.060 --> 08:14.793
That night, he came for me.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.264
And he came for you because
you read that poem,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.233
why did you say his
name out loud?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.374
Emma, here it says that...

08:31.078 --> 08:34.546
The windows and doors
were closed inside,

08:34.548 --> 08:36.414
and that you were the only
other person in the house.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.582
Yes. Of course it was me, right?

08:38.585 --> 08:40.284
The ten-year-old monster
who murdered his mother

08:40.287 --> 08:41.352
and his sister.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.129
Who told you that drawing
this would keep you away

08:51.131 --> 08:53.598
of your dreams during the night?

08:53.600 --> 08:56.101
I can not say it.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.870
Can not you say it or
do not want to say it?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.414
Because before you were
practically begging Jeremy

09:09.416 --> 09:11.149
tell us why you were desperate

09:11.151 --> 09:12.951
for drawing these things.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.920
And you knew that
a nurse found...

09:17.157 --> 09:20.058
Is this hidden in Jeremy's room?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.596
He assumed that you
gave it to him, but...

09:24.598 --> 09:27.032
That is not the case,

09:27.034 --> 09:28.400
no, Emma?

09:30.003 --> 09:32.737
Jeremy started drawing these
things in secret, right?

09:37.644 --> 09:38.877
You know what...

09:40.514 --> 09:43.615
Give someone like
Jeremy, a suicide,

09:43.617 --> 09:45.984
a sharp object like
a pencil is...

09:48.155 --> 09:49.754
A serious violation?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.195
Jeremy has spoken with you?

09:59.566 --> 10:00.732
Because, as I understand it,

10:00.734 --> 10:02.968
he has not said a word to anyone

10:02.970 --> 10:05.003
in about six years.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.838
Not since he murdered
his parents.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.278
Do you two have approached
thanks to that?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.320
Emma, help me.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.200
Well, I guess we're done here.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.168
- Dixon!
- Mr.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.671
Please, sedate Emma
and have her put

10:39.673 --> 10:41.706
in isolation at night.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.041
No, you can not do that!
He promised!

10:43.043 --> 10:44.442
Emma, you have to come with me.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.578
Can not do that! You
have to let me draw it!

10:46.580 --> 10:48.580
I can not sleep without drawing it!
I will not survive the night!

10:48.582 --> 10:50.582
One night without
making your drawings

10:50.584 --> 10:51.850
it will show you that you
have nothing to fear.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.185
- Emma, you have to calm down.
- No, no, I can not!

10:54.187 --> 10:55.353
- Lower your voice...
- You have to let me draw it!

10:55.355 --> 10:57.555
I will not survive the night!
Please please!

10:57.557 --> 10:59.357
You can not leave it!
Please! No no!

10:59.359 --> 11:01.526
Your subconscious
created this monster

11:01.528 --> 11:03.128
as a way to deal
with your guilt.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.829
Only when you realize that,

11:04.831 --> 11:05.897
you can start the job really.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.333
Do not let me do this! Do not!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.835
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

11:10.837 --> 11:13.004
Please do not do it.
Please do not do it!

11:13.006 --> 11:14.205
I'm sorry, Emma.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.042
Do not! Do not!

11:17.044 --> 11:18.276
Do not!

11:31.091 --> 11:33.725
No please! Please, do not do it!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.126
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Emma.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.194
Do not!

11:36.196 --> 11:37.762
- This is for your own good.
- Do not!

11:43.303 --> 11:44.703
No please!

11:44.705 --> 11:47.372
No, they do not understand!

11:47.374 --> 11:49.340
It will kill me!

11:58.685 --> 11:59.918
Stickman

12:22.476 --> 12:24.109
Do not.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.176
Do not!

12:29.750 --> 12:30.782
Do not!

12:34.821 --> 12:36.221
Someone help me!

12:36.223 --> 12:38.690
Someone help me please! Help!

12:38.692 --> 12:42.427
"Stickman comes to
those who sleep...

12:42.429 --> 12:43.995
- Stalking dreams..."
- No, do not read that.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.864
"For souls to harvest.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.434
Saying your name condemns
whoever hears it."

12:49.436 --> 12:52.103
You have to stop.
Stop reading it

12:52.105 --> 12:53.838
"until on their deathbeds,

12:53.840 --> 12:55.240
his blood can take."

12:55.242 --> 12:57.442
Stop please.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.877
"and he will enter this world."

13:04.918 --> 13:06.251
No please!

he will enter this world."

13:29.810 --> 13:30.942
Do not!

13:30.944 --> 13:32.811
Jeremy, no!

13:32.813 --> 13:35.780
What have you done?

13:35.782 --> 13:36.848
For!

13:36.850 --> 13:37.949
What have you done, Jeremy?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.784
For! For!

13:39.786 --> 13:42.520
Jeremy! What are you doing?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.322
- You have to stop, Jeremy.
- Do not!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.356
- Do not!
- Come on.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.457
Do not!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.126
- You have to stop.
- Do not!

13:48.128 --> 13:49.227
- Come on.
- Do not!

13:49.229 --> 13:50.461
You have to stop.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.462
Do not!

13:51.464 --> 13:52.730
Oh, come on.

13:52.732 --> 13:53.765
Do not!

14:46.720 --> 14:49.254
Very good, people.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.290
Above!

14:52.292 --> 14:55.526
It is a new day.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.495
20 minutes for breakfast.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.065
Everyone knows the procedure.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.704
If they stay in bed,
they will not be fed.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.513
Jeremy, what the
hell are you doing?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.082
Everyone go back to their rooms.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.851
One escaped in the
direction of wing c.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.524
Jeremy

15:29.229 --> 15:30.261
Jeremy

15:31.998 --> 15:33.131
Jeremy!

15:35.001 --> 15:36.401
You go after him,
I'll block him.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.956
Jeremy, you have to stop.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.223
Do not!

15:59.225 --> 16:01.292
Emma! Emma!

16:03.797 --> 16:05.964
Do not.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.131
God!

16:11.171 --> 16:12.270
Emma!

16:14.841 --> 16:16.140
Go find the doctor.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.345
Go!

16:20.347 --> 16:21.846
She is alive?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.581
Go back to wing d.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.749
Go.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.482
One year later

18:10.824 --> 18:12.290
Death of adolescent
Taylor Jameson

18:12.292 --> 18:13.791
post many questions

19:05.979 --> 19:07.145
Emma

19:08.348 --> 19:10.081
Emma?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.617
How are you this morning?

19:12.619 --> 19:13.651
It could not be better.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.624
You have progressed
a lot since we met.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.425
Thanks to you.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.327
Next week will be a year
without nightmares.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.631
I have been informed
of something.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.099
And I want to talk
to you about it.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.205
Emma,

19:34.207 --> 19:37.575
how would you feel when you
leave here, hollybrooke?

19:39.913 --> 19:41.245
Go?

19:41.247 --> 19:43.014
And go where?

19:43.016 --> 19:45.650
A place has been
opened in a shelter

19:45.652 --> 19:47.251
transition for young women.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.987
You will spend seven months
there, until your 18th birthday.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.657
It is a way to facilitate
your return to society.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.891
- Do you think you're ready for that?
- Yes

19:53.893 --> 19:56.060
yes. Very much.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.395
All right.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.096
I also.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.598
They'll be here in a
couple of hours, okay?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.833
What? As soon?

20:02.835 --> 20:05.203
The sooner the better, right?

20:05.205 --> 20:08.372
Emma, it's time to take
control of your life.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.674
Congratulations.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.017
Did you hear that?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.854
Do not. Jeremy, wait.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.763
Jeremy does not want to
talk to you yet, huh?

21:38.765 --> 21:41.465
Not a word since he found out.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.801
It will be ok.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.969
Who knows? Maybe
I'll start talking

21:44.971 --> 21:46.237
with the rest of us.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.573
I would like to see that.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.778
I just came to tell you
that the truck is here.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.347
You should probably go down.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.915
It's okay.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.350
I'm almost ready.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.064
Good for you outside, okay?

22:14.567 --> 22:16.801
You do not need to
come back here, right?

22:18.504 --> 22:19.637
Yes.

22:19.639 --> 22:20.905
I promise.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.123
How much time has passed?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.459
Since I was ten, so...

24:21.461 --> 24:22.693
Seven years.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.863
Are you nervous?

24:29.335 --> 24:30.835
Terrified, rather.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.841
I would say that the worst
was behind us, right?

24:39.111 --> 24:40.277
I hope so.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.381
Yes.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.275
What do you do? I said I
only needed the wrench.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.810
As if he knew what that is.

25:27.693 --> 25:28.859
So she is, huh?

25:37.169 --> 25:39.136
It looks different from
how I imagined it.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.372
How should a madwoman look?

25:41.374 --> 25:43.274
I do not know. Like
you, I suppose.

25:43.276 --> 25:44.341
Shut up.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.313
Listen, the girls here
bark more than they bite.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.782
You have as much right
as they to be here.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.920
Do they know that?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.187
No problem. You'll be fine.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.159
Girls, this is Emma.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.727
He will stay with
us for a while,

26:03.729 --> 26:06.363
so I want to make
her feel at home.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.899
Hi, I'm Paige.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.868
And this ray of sunshine is Liv.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.808
Paige, could you introduce
Emma to Mrs. hill?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.611
While Liv helps me
with purchases?

26:20.613 --> 26:21.612
Clear.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.846
It's okay.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.518
I have it.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.186
Come on, it's almost
dinner time, so Mrs. hill

26:29.188 --> 26:31.188
I'm probably watching
the kitchen.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.559
Liv...

26:35.561 --> 26:36.760
Come on.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.965
Do not worry about Liv.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.666
It comes from a family
of car thieves,

26:42.668 --> 26:45.803
so trust is not
your strong point.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.806
On the other hand, if you
ever need to steal a car,

26:48.808 --> 26:49.974
she is the one

26:51.644 --> 26:53.010
I will keep it in mind.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.456
Well, we are only five.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.858
They let us watch TV until 9:00.

27:09.562 --> 27:13.764
The light goes off at 10:00,
so it's not that bad here.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.633
It really is not a bad place.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.869
Do you monitor
everything you do here?

27:18.871 --> 27:21.238
Why would it be different
here than outside?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.906
Now we live in a
state of vigilance.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.708
Everyone watches 24 hours a day.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.010
Do not listen to Kate,

27:26.012 --> 27:29.446
she is the kind of paranoid
of the "dark web".

27:29.448 --> 27:32.282
He will not be happy until
he burns the whole system.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.720
At least I did not burn
my own house, stupid.

27:36.722 --> 27:39.356
That was a mistake.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.691
Although it was beautiful.

27:42.595 --> 27:44.928
What is a mistake is
to listen to anything

27:44.930 --> 27:46.664
let these two say.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.932
If someone should worry
about secret surveillance

27:48.934 --> 27:50.968
it's you, Tess.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.003
The ex of Tess recorded
it secretly, you know...

27:53.005 --> 27:56.206
In a compromising way.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.076
So Tess went into her ex's
house to look for the video,

27:59.078 --> 28:00.844
but everything he found

28:00.846 --> 28:03.947
he went to the police
waiting outside.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.817
And where is justice
in that, right?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.318
Leave it alone!

28:11.490 --> 28:13.457
Does anyone else want to guess
what he did to get through

28:13.459 --> 28:14.692
seven years in hollybrooke?

28:14.694 --> 28:16.794
Liv, I told you to leave this.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.062
Go ahead, Emma, tell them.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.030
This is not the time
or the place for this.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.098
She committed double murder.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.300
Emma killed her mother
and her sister.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.235
Do not. No, I did not do it.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.437
I did not do it.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.172
Now are you going to lie to us?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.441
Leave it right now. Really.

28:38.718 --> 28:41.385
Liv, leave it!

28:41.387 --> 28:42.653
What are you looking for, huh?

28:42.655 --> 28:45.022
- Leave her, Liv.
- Liv!

28:45.024 --> 28:46.223
- What is this?
- Do not!

28:46.225 --> 28:48.726
- Leave her!
- Do not read that!

28:48.728 --> 28:49.827
Give it back to me!

28:49.829 --> 28:51.361
"Stickman comes to
those who sleep..."

28:51.363 --> 28:52.963
- What is that?
- "... stalking dreams..."

28:52.965 --> 28:54.198
- Do not!
- "... for souls to harvest.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.066
- Say your name..."
- You do not know what are you doing!

28:56.068 --> 28:57.067
Give it back, Liv.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.836
"Those who say it,
invite you to enter,

28:58.838 --> 29:00.070
until on their deathbeds,

29:00.072 --> 29:01.371
- your blood can take."
- For!

29:01.373 --> 29:03.741
You have to stop,
do not finish it!

29:03.743 --> 29:05.743
- Liv, I warn you!
- "If I die before waking up,

29:05.745 --> 29:08.178
it was stickman who
took my soul."

29:10.416 --> 29:12.249
What the hell is happening here!

29:16.255 --> 29:18.922
I will not sleep
with a crazy killer

29:18.924 --> 29:20.657
under the same roof.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.693
I do not remember you having
a voice in this, Liv.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.597
Either you get her out
of here, or I will.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.999
Are you threatening me?

29:29.001 --> 29:31.301
Because you have to know that
this is a one-way ticket

29:31.303 --> 29:33.036
direct to the reformatory.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.671
Calm down, Liv.

29:34.673 --> 29:35.806
Hears!

29:35.808 --> 29:38.475
- Liv, no.
- Look, it's not worth it, Liv.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.600
Are not you going to unpack?

30:03.602 --> 30:06.436
I do not think I'm
here tomorrow.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.671
Lights off.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.942
What Liv said...

30:14.613 --> 30:16.313
Did you do those things?

30:22.922 --> 30:26.023
They say I did it, but...

30:26.025 --> 30:27.991
I know that it is not.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.064
You never said why you are here.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.802
I blew my teeth to a girl

30:38.804 --> 30:41.271
because I was
bothering a friend.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.873
She filed charges, so...

30:44.643 --> 30:46.310
Come on, lights off.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.479
I think you should unpack.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.550
Hears...

30:55.487 --> 30:56.887
If you have a nightmare tonight,

30:56.889 --> 30:58.155
let me know.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.290
Please someone help me!

31:33.292 --> 31:35.492
Please!

31:35.494 --> 31:36.894
Emma, can you hear me?

31:36.896 --> 31:37.895
Emma

31:37.897 --> 31:39.129
Emma, open the door.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.230
Emma!

31:43.002 --> 31:44.034
Emma!

31:46.538 --> 31:49.306
- Who is with her?
- I do not know!

31:49.308 --> 31:51.475
Where is Liv?

31:51.477 --> 31:52.843
Here.

31:56.849 --> 31:59.750
Why does not this door open?

31:59.752 --> 32:01.118
All fall back.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.131
Please help me.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.033
God please help me!

32:18.170 --> 32:19.369
Emma!

32:19.371 --> 32:20.671
What happened!

32:23.809 --> 32:25.342
Call the police!

32:32.151 --> 32:33.784
Get out of here, come on!

32:37.222 --> 32:38.355
Liv!

32:41.760 --> 32:43.193
Come on, we have to leave now.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.776
It's... it's...

32:59.778 --> 33:00.844
She's dead.

33:04.717 --> 33:06.416
- What did you do!
- Liv!

33:06.418 --> 33:08.652
What the hell did you do?

33:08.654 --> 33:11.054
- Liv, you have to get out of there!
- Was not me!

33:14.760 --> 33:17.227
Oh god.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.428
Oh my god.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.830
She's dead!

33:21.667 --> 33:23.300
So who was it, huh?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.768
Because I do not
see anyone else.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.236
I do not know! Has no sense!

33:26.238 --> 33:28.205
I should not be here!

33:28.207 --> 33:30.140
It should not be
out of our dreams!

33:32.244 --> 33:35.912
Does anyone else know what
this crazy woman talks about?

33:35.914 --> 33:37.280
Andrea, check the closet.

33:37.282 --> 33:38.715
I do not think so.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.283
Oh, for god's sake, Andrea.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.726
- Nothing.
- So?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.728
Did a person come in and vanish?

33:51.730 --> 33:54.798
It was not... It
was not a person.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.400
Do you think I'm stupid?

33:58.871 --> 34:00.103
Maybe I should
finish with you now

34:00.105 --> 34:01.738
before you can do
this to someone else!

34:01.740 --> 34:02.839
Stop!

34:02.841 --> 34:04.341
Leave her! Enough.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.442
Look what he did!

34:05.444 --> 34:06.710
How could she do that?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.311
I do not know, but
he will tell me now.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.646
- Do not be stupid!
- Right now!

34:09.648 --> 34:11.313
Let the police take
care of this, okay?

34:11.315 --> 34:12.716
Tell me!

34:12.717 --> 34:15.886
It was... it was stickman.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.626
Andrea, was it you?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.163
You should not have
read that poem.

34:28.033 --> 34:31.467
You should never
have said his name.

34:31.469 --> 34:35.205
They have no idea what kind
of danger they are in.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.474
For years, he was
only in my dreams,

34:37.476 --> 34:42.245
but now it's here, in the room.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.882
I do not know how, but I
know it comes for all of us.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.286
To the devil.

34:53.358 --> 34:54.925
Maybe it was the wind.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.937
No one.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.409
Look, if there's someone
else in the house,

35:12.411 --> 35:14.678
we would see it in the
security cameras.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.912
Do not?

35:15.914 --> 35:18.882
Liv, stop. Stop, okay?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.484
Come on, let's
check the cameras.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.056
Just go, come on.

35:41.073 --> 35:42.873
There is nothing here.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.674
How come there is nothing?

35:44.676 --> 35:46.676
It's as if someone had
disconnected the cameras.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.885
There.

35:54.887 --> 35:57.187
The camera in the
corridor of the rooms.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.321
Stop right there.

36:00.125 --> 36:03.627
Come? It's Paige talking to me.
I was in my room.

36:03.629 --> 36:04.728
It is true.

36:07.399 --> 36:11.034
There's no way I've
disabled the cameras.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.036
Wait. Go back

36:13.038 --> 36:14.137
there.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.405
In the dining room.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.611
Well, that's a problem.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.320
Perfect. It is perfect.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.589
We will only tell the
police the truth.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.090
And in what world would
they believe us?

36:34.092 --> 36:35.325
Just delete it.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.494
This is in the cloud. There
is no way to reach it.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.430
Girls, listen, you have
to listen to me, okay?

36:40.432 --> 36:42.399
The police are the
least of our problems.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.369
Something changed. I had
never seen it before

36:46.371 --> 36:48.705
out of my dreams.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.442
Look, I've had enough
of your madness, okay?

36:52.444 --> 36:53.810
Look, I saw it.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.847
You saw that?

36:57.849 --> 37:00.283
Saw...

37:00.285 --> 37:02.686
I saw something in
the room with Emma.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.187
She was not alone.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.491
Well, then, where did he get?

37:08.493 --> 37:09.526
Where is he now?

37:09.528 --> 37:10.794
You do not get it. Do not...

37:12.464 --> 37:14.898
- He did not seem human.
- Because that is not it.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.501
And they all heard
her read that poem,

37:18.503 --> 37:20.036
now it will also
come for all of you.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.471
Both are crazy.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.774
How do you think he did that
to Cathy and Mrs. hill alone?

37:24.776 --> 37:26.409
He could not have done
it and you know it.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.211
Wait, are you saying there
is a type of monster

37:28.213 --> 37:30.280
- after us?
- Yes!

37:30.282 --> 37:32.716
And it will not stop
until we're dead.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.884
Oh god! Why are we
listening to this garbage?

37:34.886 --> 37:37.354
All right! Then do not listen.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.755
And see where that takes you.

37:40.525 --> 37:41.591
Hears!

37:46.365 --> 37:48.965
Hears! Where the hell do you
think you're going? Hey?

37:48.967 --> 37:50.400
I need to go back
to hollybrooke.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.704
You will not go anywhere.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.874
Maybe you do not believe me
now, but believe me, you will.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.478
But it will be too late.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.047
Emma, then tell
us what this did.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.315
Tell us what it is

38:06.084 --> 38:07.350
explain

38:11.556 --> 38:13.623
he killed my mother,

38:13.625 --> 38:14.724
and killed my sister.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.926
And then it came for me,

38:16.928 --> 38:18.862
chasing me in dreams.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.730
That's what he does.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.998
It follows you

38:22.000 --> 38:24.100
and it tires you until you
lose the will to live

38:24.102 --> 38:26.136
and then it takes you.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.039
I fought against
him a long time,

38:29.041 --> 38:31.808
until I could not fight anymore.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.610
And then I found a
way to catch him.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.046
- This is crazy.
- God, Liv, let her talk.

38:36.048 --> 38:38.081
Wait. If you caught him,
how can he be here?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.883
I do not know!

38:39.885 --> 38:41.985
It is what I should find out.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.988
Somehow, he freed himself
and entered this world.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.423
As the poem said.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.659
Wait. Is all this from a poem?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.194
I told them I was crazy.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.196
Enough! Wait, okay?

38:59.404 --> 39:03.540
It's not like you have a
reasonable explanation,

39:03.542 --> 39:04.574
true?

39:08.313 --> 39:09.646
When it is day, it
will not be long

39:09.648 --> 39:11.214
until they notice the absence
of Cathy and Mrs. hill.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.249
What do you think
will happen then?

39:13.251 --> 39:14.284
He's right, Liv.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.221
You said it yourself.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.457
There is no way for the
police to believe us.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.028
Like it or not, we are
together in this.

39:50.822 --> 39:53.223
- Did you find the keys?
- God, you scared me.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.665
I did not want anyone
to see us here.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.028
I had to search Cathy's
pockets to find them.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.630
I also have your phone.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.967
I really do not think
I should be here.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.136
You took the short
stick, it's fair.

40:06.138 --> 40:08.505
If you want to change places
with someone, talk to Liv.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.080
Oh my god.

40:40.739 --> 40:41.871
What the hell are you doing?

40:41.873 --> 40:43.840
I try to find out who
we are dealing with.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.408
Will you help us or not?

40:45.410 --> 40:47.343
I will do it.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.678
I...

40:48.680 --> 40:51.214
I do not think I feel
good about this.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.749
Just take your feet.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.653
Look, we'll put it at the
bottom of the stairs,

40:56.655 --> 40:58.221
we'll make it look like
they came here after Emma

40:58.223 --> 40:59.722
because she was
crazy or something,

40:59.724 --> 41:00.723
and then one thing
led to the other,

41:00.725 --> 41:02.459
and pushed her down the stairs.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.362
I do not know, Liv.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.965
Tess, I can not do
it without you.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.034
It will be his word
against ours, okay?

41:18.276 --> 41:20.043
Will you help us or not, Kate?

41:22.414 --> 41:23.913
Hello?

41:23.915 --> 41:25.081
Planet earth to Kate.

41:27.853 --> 41:28.885
What is this map?

41:33.792 --> 41:35.825
Hey, where the hell
are you going?

41:44.636 --> 41:47.637
They find a nine-year-old
girl dead in her room

42:00.385 --> 42:02.485
Child dies while sleeping

42:09.528 --> 42:11.661
Adolescent of clearmont
dies mysteriously

42:11.663 --> 42:13.329
"the local student,
will Johnson,

42:13.331 --> 42:15.698
he was found dead in the
school dressing room."

42:22.107 --> 42:25.208
Tommy hagen, will Johnson...

42:25.210 --> 42:26.276
Oh my god.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.288
You're good?

42:43.962 --> 42:46.062
We have to go after
Paige and Andrea.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.096
We have to warn them.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.867
I'll find the keys to Mrs.
Hill's car.

42:50.869 --> 42:52.468
Wait to...?

42:52.470 --> 42:54.737
What's going on?

42:54.739 --> 42:56.899
It is possible that Emma is
not as crazy as we thought.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.178
Paige has Cathy's phone,

43:02.180 --> 43:03.379
try calling them there.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.272
Kate?

43:30.742 --> 43:31.808
Kate!

43:40.552 --> 43:41.918
Kate!

43:41.920 --> 43:43.653
No no no. We have to go, okay?

43:43.655 --> 43:44.655
Go go.

43:55.767 --> 43:56.767
God.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.875
What do you expect
to find here exactly

44:38.877 --> 44:40.543
what is so important?

44:40.545 --> 44:42.779
There is a patient
here who is like me.

44:42.781 --> 44:45.648
From the age of nine he is
persecuted as he is by us.

44:45.650 --> 44:46.783
He will know what to do.

44:57.696 --> 45:00.430
Do you think they
are waiting for us?

45:00.432 --> 45:02.965
Would not they have
stopped us already?

45:02.967 --> 45:04.834
Do not.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.470
Something must have
happened in the hospital.

45:07.472 --> 45:08.638
Well, now what?

45:11.976 --> 45:13.409
Stop right there.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.711
We can go through the forest

45:14.713 --> 45:16.145
to get to the back
of the hospital.

45:16.147 --> 45:19.482
Wait, wait, I really
think we should go.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.384
Look, if you want
to survive this,

45:21.386 --> 45:22.518
our best option to get answers

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
is there.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.374
I do not know why
this is happening.

45:45.376 --> 45:46.542
You have to calm down.

45:46.544 --> 45:48.511
But Kate said that
everything was true.

45:48.513 --> 45:49.545
Everything Emma said was true.

45:49.547 --> 45:50.980
Listen to me. Come.

45:50.982 --> 45:53.316
Look, I do not know what the
hell Kate was talking about,

45:53.318 --> 45:54.550
but you can be sure

45:54.552 --> 45:56.018
that once someone
finds those bodies,

45:56.020 --> 45:57.587
we will all go for a long time

45:57.589 --> 46:00.556
unless we can find out what
the hell is going on here.

46:00.558 --> 46:01.758
And if we are the following?

46:04.863 --> 46:06.129
That will not happen.

46:07.732 --> 46:10.900
We'll go a few blocks from
here, we'll steal a car,

46:10.902 --> 46:14.070
and we will find
Paige and Andrea.

46:14.072 --> 46:16.339
We'll get through this, Tess.
We will come out of this.

46:17.809 --> 46:18.808
- Yes?
- Agree.

46:18.810 --> 46:19.842
Yes very good.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.321
How do you expect to
talk to this guy?

46:32.323 --> 46:34.023
I'm friends with
one of the nurses.

46:34.025 --> 46:35.258
Your turn ends within an hour.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.292
Maybe the...

46:43.001 --> 46:44.367
Apparently we were late.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.738
Well, if we manage to
cross the back fence,

46:48.740 --> 46:51.407
we can reach the
stairs next to wing c.

46:51.409 --> 46:52.942
Nurses sometimes
leave the door open

46:52.944 --> 46:54.443
during your rest.

46:54.445 --> 46:56.512
We do not even know how much has
been burned out of the hospital.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.714
Maybe there is nobody there.

46:58.716 --> 47:00.683
Even so, we should review.

47:00.685 --> 47:03.019
Just to make sure.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.353
The pyromaniac says it.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.959
Do you hear that?

47:17.635 --> 47:18.668
Come on!

47:22.774 --> 47:23.774
Hide yourself.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.364
Ellis!

47:48.366 --> 47:50.032
You do not want to stay
out here all night!

47:50.034 --> 47:51.868
Or if?

47:51.870 --> 47:53.569
Ellis!

47:53.571 --> 47:55.872
Come on, it's time
to go back inside!

47:57.375 --> 47:58.407
Come on, Ellis!

48:18.096 --> 48:19.428
This this!

48:21.266 --> 48:22.298
Hears...

48:25.670 --> 48:26.702
Very good.

48:29.607 --> 48:30.840
Okay, come on, come on.

48:34.846 --> 48:35.945
Very good.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.620
Amanda, get out of there!

48:44.622 --> 48:47.990
We have a patient
escaping from the f wing

48:47.992 --> 48:49.125
in pursuit.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.197
Come back here!

48:55.199 --> 48:56.365
Amanda, come back here!

49:00.805 --> 49:02.171
Let's get this over with.

49:09.013 --> 49:10.046
Come on.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.767
What happens?

49:31.769 --> 49:34.036
Emma?

49:34.038 --> 49:37.340
I did not think I
would go back here.

49:38.810 --> 49:42.378
I thought I was done
with this place forever.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.513
There has to be
another way, right?

49:44.515 --> 49:45.881
We do not have to do this.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.753
Yes.

49:50.755 --> 49:51.787
Yes, we have to do it.

49:59.864 --> 50:00.963
What do you do?

50:00.965 --> 50:02.665
I call the foster home,

50:02.667 --> 50:04.667
I'll tell Liv and the
others what's going on.

50:11.609 --> 50:12.742
Come on, answer.

50:15.013 --> 50:16.078
They do not answer.

50:19.484 --> 50:20.844
Maybe they did not
know it was me.

50:33.264 --> 50:34.530
Welcome to hollybrooke.

50:37.702 --> 50:38.734
Come on.

51:09.966 --> 51:11.834
Maybe we should keep driving

51:11.836 --> 51:14.303
and leave the city.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.472
No, not without warning
Paige and Andrea.

51:20.144 --> 51:21.610
If you're right. You're right.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.022
Take a look at this, okay?

51:33.024 --> 51:34.890
Kate must have printed
it for some reason.

51:44.168 --> 51:45.901
All are articles
about dead children

51:45.903 --> 51:46.869
here in clearmont.

51:46.871 --> 51:48.003
Except...

51:50.441 --> 51:52.942
No one seems to know
what killed them.

51:52.944 --> 51:54.477
How many children?

51:54.479 --> 51:56.112
I do not know.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.213
Many.

52:11.863 --> 52:13.362
God.

52:13.364 --> 52:14.463
What?

52:16.300 --> 52:17.466
What?

52:17.468 --> 52:18.767
It is just that...

52:18.769 --> 52:20.970
It seems that Emma traced the
deaths of these children.

52:22.707 --> 52:24.173
- Why do that?
- I do not know.

52:24.175 --> 52:26.675
It seems that many
of these deaths

52:26.677 --> 52:30.379
occurred in downtown
clearmont and...

52:30.381 --> 52:32.047
They have been
spreading since then.

52:33.551 --> 52:35.217
What do you mean
by "scattering"?

52:35.219 --> 52:39.388
Each of these children lived
farther than the previous one.

52:39.390 --> 52:43.492
So what killed them is going
through the whole city.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.693
Wait!

52:47.265 --> 52:49.031
What the hell was that?

52:49.033 --> 52:50.833
- What the hell was that!
- What was that?

52:50.835 --> 52:51.967
What is it?

53:38.282 --> 53:39.315
Did you live here?

53:41.819 --> 53:43.452
Yes.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.520
For seven years.

53:46.524 --> 53:48.524
I can not believe I was
here just this morning.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.095
That's my room, on the right.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.700
Jeremy was in front.

54:11.916 --> 54:12.982
It is this...

54:17.788 --> 54:20.122
Something you will
never want to know.

54:20.124 --> 54:22.258
Emma? You gotta see this.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.436
This is what I saw, is not it?

54:34.438 --> 54:37.139
What I saw with you
in your room tonight?

54:41.178 --> 54:42.278
I was trying to catch him.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.181
He must have known
that he had escaped

54:46.183 --> 54:49.518
and I was trying to
catch him again.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.719
Catch it? Catch it how?

54:53.958 --> 54:55.190
"Until on their deathbeds,

54:55.192 --> 54:56.492
his blood can take."

55:01.999 --> 55:03.799
If you draw it with your
blood when you are dying,

55:03.801 --> 55:05.000
he catches him in some way,

55:05.002 --> 55:08.137
or send it back to
where it came from.

55:08.139 --> 55:11.206
So he caught it?

55:11.208 --> 55:14.610
They must have taken it out
again before I could finish.

55:14.612 --> 55:16.612
Again?

55:16.614 --> 55:18.747
What have you done, Jeremy? For!

55:18.749 --> 55:22.084
He tried to commit suicide
when I had just arrived.

55:22.086 --> 55:24.553
He cut his wrists and
then tried to draw it.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.754
- Jeremy, what are you doing?
- Do not!

55:25.756 --> 55:27.556
I have to finish drawing it!

55:27.558 --> 55:28.624
Jeremy, stop!

55:28.626 --> 55:30.392
Do not! Do not!

55:33.831 --> 55:35.671
At that time, I did not
know what he was doing.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.368
But I think he was
trying to save me.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.689
Maybe I should try
to catch him again.

55:55.319 --> 55:57.219
I'm doing another
revision in the d wing.

55:57.221 --> 55:58.554
I warn them if I find someone.

56:07.998 --> 56:09.231
What the hell?

56:13.771 --> 56:15.404
<i>Guys, Ellis is back in wing a.</i>

56:15.406 --> 56:18.941
<i>We're still looking for Terry,
Samantha, Sarah, Jeremy.</i>

56:18.943 --> 56:21.477
Copied.

56:32.957 --> 56:35.290
Hey hey!

56:35.292 --> 56:38.193
There are two that escape
towards the e wing.

56:40.030 --> 56:42.030
Stop! Hey!

56:59.884 --> 57:00.949
Let's go.

57:00.951 --> 57:02.418
Do not.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.052
There is something
else that I must see.

57:06.390 --> 57:07.623
This will take us there.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.692
Wait!

57:10.694 --> 57:12.361
We will not take another
step until you tell us

57:12.363 --> 57:13.829
what is so important

57:13.831 --> 57:15.197
as to risk being caught.

57:25.142 --> 57:27.042
Last year

57:27.044 --> 57:30.179
I did what Jeremy tried
to do with the drawing.

57:31.682 --> 57:34.149
But I finished mine.

57:34.151 --> 57:36.985
And he has not attacked
me since then.

57:36.987 --> 57:39.421
Not until tonight.

57:39.423 --> 57:40.556
Not until this fire.

57:45.563 --> 57:47.062
I need to know what
happened to the drawing,

57:47.064 --> 57:48.464
and we have to find Jeremy.

57:51.335 --> 57:52.668
Wait a minute.

57:54.171 --> 57:55.204
Wait a minute.

58:04.615 --> 58:06.715
That's what they use to
keep us in isolation.

58:08.853 --> 58:10.519
There I caught him.

58:10.521 --> 58:12.888
The fire destroyed the drawing.

58:14.758 --> 58:16.798
"Break that strength, and
he will enter this world."

58:19.630 --> 58:21.730
According to the poem,

58:21.732 --> 58:25.601
if you destroy the trap, it
frees it to the real world.

58:27.071 --> 58:29.338
Free to kill everything
that crosses his path.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.373
How do we stop it now?

58:31.375 --> 58:33.509
Let's find Jeremy.

58:33.511 --> 58:34.543
Come on.

58:36.113 --> 58:37.779
They keep looking for
Jeremy on the radio.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.181
We have to find it before them.

58:41.452 --> 58:42.818
What do you do?

58:42.820 --> 58:44.286
I do not want to
be here anymore.

58:44.288 --> 58:46.255
Andrea, we are safer
when we are together.

58:46.257 --> 58:47.923
I think the safest thing for me

58:47.925 --> 58:50.025
is to get away as much as
possible from you and all this.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.894
You can not escape this thing.

58:51.896 --> 58:53.462
You will find yourself
no matter where you are.

58:53.464 --> 58:55.531
Yes, then I think
I'll take a chance.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.566
- Andrea, do not be stupid.
- Please.

58:57.568 --> 58:58.834
Leave me alone

59:01.038 --> 59:02.070
Andrea!

59:04.942 --> 59:06.408
Emma!

59:10.481 --> 59:11.613
Do not move.

59:11.615 --> 59:12.881
Do not move!

59:12.883 --> 59:14.750
Hey! Hey!

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:50.045
If we had told the
police everything,

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:52.147
as we should have done
from the beginning,

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.282
maybe Andrea would
still be alive.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.952
Listen to me. We
are alone in this.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.554
- They can not help us.
- What are we supposed to do?

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:02.624
That thing will
kill us one by one.

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.760
No. We have to find Jeremy.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:06.294
He told me how to get
him out of my dreams.

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:09.498
He discovered a way to
catch him before me.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.999
If we can find it,

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.634
maybe he knows how to
kill this son of a bitch

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:14.569
once and for all.

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:15.971
How do you know
he's still alive?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.975
They're looking for it
on the radio, right?

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.279
They would not look
for a dead man.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:28.850
I do not want to die, okay?

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.054
I will not let that happen.

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:36.291
I promise.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.329
Agree.

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:44.499
Come on.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:57.345
Where we go?

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:01.316
If Jeremy managed
to get out of here,

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:03.151
he probably went to the
only place he knows.

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:05.721
To home.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:06.755
Yes.

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:11.560
Come on, your address
should be in your file.

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:39.521
What the hell happened here?

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:53.969
This is...

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:55.203
This is my file.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.273
Is that blood?

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.287
Why would he kill him?

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.789
I told him not to read it.

01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:17.058
He read the poem.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.394
Why did not you hear me?

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.065
Let's find what we came for

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.001
and let's get out of
here before that thing

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:27.302
find us again, okay?

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.540
I'll call the foster home.

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:52.427
<i>This is detective bowman.</i>

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:53.628
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.763
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.935
Police...

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:01.002
They are in the house.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.439
What about Liv?

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.574
And the other ones?

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.076
I do not know.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:14.182
Let's just find the address
and get out of here, okay?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.250
Check the desktop.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.343
There's a phone. There is a
public telephone. Come on.

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:49.451
Do not. No no no.

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:50.752
Perfect.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:52.520
Just perfect.

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.655
Anyone there.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:54.789
Come on, they'll have
a phone we can use

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.625
to call Paige.

01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:58.360
Well well.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.328
Well well. For the blood
of your shoulder.

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:01.529
Take this, cover yourself.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.339
You're good?

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.374
You'll be fine, okay?

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:13.408
Agree.

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:34.562
It seems they have had
a difficult night.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.733
Do you have a phone
that we can use?

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:41.269
Yes.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:48.076
But...

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:51.880
It's against our policy
to let someone use it.

01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:54.082
- Look, let's just go, okay?
- Listen out...

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.453
Maybe we can reach some
kind of agreement.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.524
What do you have in mind?

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:09.864
Oh, let's just say that my
friend and I would be...

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:15.303
We would be very grateful.

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:22.811
A call.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:23.878
I'll close the door.

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:30.318
What are you thinking exactly?

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:33.588
It will not happen.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:37.192
Come on, Tess,
what's the number?

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.494
Open

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:00.782
I think I found it.

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:07.722
Why are not there
drawings like yours here?

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.624
No one here knows.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.227
Apart from me, he
never told anyone.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.361
He stopped talking the next day

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:14.723
to say his name for
the first time.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:19.634
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:20.702
They will listen to us!

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:25.106
<i>Paige</i>

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.374
<i>Paige, are you there?</i>

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.510
Liv?

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:30.245
Listen out. Listen,
it's real, okay?

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:34.049
He killed Kate and
he comes for us.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.183
Andrea is also dead.

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:39.154
God.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:43.258
<i>Tess is hurt, but she's alive.</i>

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.160
We have to go.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:46.628
Tell them to meet us
at the bedford bridge,

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.996
just before the hospital.

01:07:47.998 --> 01:07:49.798
- Did you hear that?
- Yes

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.132
<i>bedford bridge.</i>

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:52.333
If, according.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:53.668
<i>Okay, we'll be there.</i>

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:58.840
Paige! Paige!

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.083
Paige! Paige, wait!

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:10.085
What? What's going on?

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.531
Well, we'll turn the desk over.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.934
Are you ready? You are with me?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.868
One two three.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.505
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:40.782
Hey! Hey! High!

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.453
Hey! High!

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.856
- Paige! Paige!
- What's going on?

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:49.624
<i>Hello?</i>

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.959
<i>- Hello?
- What's happening?</i>

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.160
What's going on? Hello?

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:53.428
Hello? What's going on?

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.496
Hello?

01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.399
Oh my god. Oh my god.

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.236
Tess! Tess! Get off the phone!

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.179
Oh, my god, Tess!

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:14.415
No, do not shoot!

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:23.057
- Who the hell are you?
- Do not!

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.573
Do not.

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:15.944
Come on. Come on.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.622
Well, I'll go in
the middle, guys.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:29.757
Ahead.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:44.205
Well, they're behind the hospital.
Send to all who can.

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:45.607
<i>Are they two of ours?</i>

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:48.109
It does not seem. They are
wearing street clothes.

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:51.913
<i>Dixon, I just found to Dr.
fenton.</i>

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:54.082
<i>Somebody... someone
cut his neck.</i>

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:57.819
Oh god.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.457
What the hell is happening here?

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:03.925
Hey, over here!

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:04.959
They found them.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.860
Stay here.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:41.195
I will see that
everything is clear.

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:42.730
Agree. Do not delay.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:51.239
Dixon

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:53.141
Emma

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.442
listen, before you do something,

01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:55.943
I need you to
listen to me, okay?

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:57.211
Yes please?

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.618
Emma, what have you done?

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:07.255
Are you involved with the
deaths of these people?

01:12:07.257 --> 01:12:08.523
With the death of Dr. fenton?

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:10.258
No, no, we had nothing
to do with that.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.026
You have to believe me.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.161
He is telling the truth.

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:17.231
So you only came here.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:18.266
The day you left,

01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:19.701
the day when chaos is unleashed.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.571
- I do not think so.
- Do not! No please.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:25.773
If they arrest us, we will
not survive the night.

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:28.309
We will be dead like everyone else.
Please.

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:29.711
Dixon, you know me.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:32.747
You know I would never
do something like this.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:34.349
Then help me understand, Emma.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:35.917
What the hell is happening here?

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:38.953
It's good, it's fine. I went
back to talk to Jeremy.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:39.987
Jeremy?

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:43.424
Do you know that Jeremy
tried to commit suicide

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:44.492
after the fire started?

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.595
He tried to escape
during the evacuation,

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.030
before we could help him.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.800
I would be very surprised, Emma,
if Jeremy were still alive.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:55.236
He was just trying to stop him.

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.705
- Stop what?
- The thing.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.809
The thing about my nightmares,
and about the drawings, is real.

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:05.680
I'm sorry, Emma, seriously,
but you need help.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.548
Please. Please.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:18.359
Leave him alone, son of a bitch!

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:19.761
You promised.

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.570
Do not!

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:49.624
Do not.

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:52.760
The keys.

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:01.837
Liv?

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.309
Liv!

01:14:17.387 --> 01:14:18.753
It's you, thank god.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.089
Liv, what's wrong?

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:25.226
Where is Tess?

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:31.399
Liv, what's wrong?

01:14:31.401 --> 01:14:32.533
Liv...

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:33.868
Liv, what are you saying?

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:41.142
You have to run.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.610
You have to...

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:43.678
You have to run.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.347
You have to run!
You have to run!

01:15:26.456 --> 01:15:27.722
You were right.

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:31.852
Hears.

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:33.888
Hears!

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.056
This is your stop!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.200
You have to open this door!

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:51.839
You have to open it!

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:53.941
Hey, calm down.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.010
That door gets stuck sometimes.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.667
This is...

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.369
This is the house of my dreams.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.463
Jeremy?

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.065
- What the hell are you doing?
- You have to go.

01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:29.136
I'll do this alone, okay?

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:30.438
Nobody else will
die because of me.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.540
No no. What do you mean?
This is not your fault.

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:39.380
Look, it is, yes?

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.552
They're all dead because of me.

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:46.887
Your sister, your mother,
killed because of me.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:49.156
No, they're dead
because of that thing!

01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:55.529
I gave that poem to your sister.

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.767
From a book that I found.

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:01.368
What? What?

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.237
I put it in his
backpack on the bus.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:08.876
I did it to many other people.

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:15.449
I thought maybe if I delivered
it, it would go away.

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:16.884
But it was worse.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:24.358
Look, it started with me,
it will end with me.

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:28.129
What damn book?

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.330
- Emma.
- What are you talking about!

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:30.431
- Emma.
- Tell me!

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:32.166
It's good, it's good, it's good.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:34.068
I moved to this house
when I was nine.

01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.110
In the basement there was a
loose brick in the wall.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.572
There I found the book,

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:40.775
as if someone had
tried to hide it.

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:42.743
I found a poem there.

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:45.479
That was the first
time I said his name.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.514
Where is that book now?

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:49.450
When I...

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:51.352
When he killed my parents,

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:53.053
I hid it in the basement wall.

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:56.290
I thought maybe I would stop
it, but it was not like that.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.792
Emma, please.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.193
Look, I tried to warn you.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.162
I went to the shelter and
the police was there.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:03.063
Did you kill Dr.
Fenton to find me?

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:05.166
He would not give
me your address.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:06.867
I did it for you.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:09.537
Well, I came here to
destroy it for you.

01:20:09.539 --> 01:20:13.140
Now the only thing I
want you to do is die.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.642
Emma, please, do not do it.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:27.254
You came here to finish it.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:28.756
Now you will help
me finish the job.

01:20:48.744 --> 01:20:51.912
How do you know that burning
the book will kill this thing?

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:52.947
I do not know.

01:20:58.721 --> 01:21:00.888
My arm... it does not fit.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.056
Let me try.

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.404
I'm sorry, Emma.

01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:20.841
I really regret it,
for everything.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:28.682
He was nine, yes?

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:33.554
I was scared, I did
not want to die.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:35.756
My mother was scared.

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:37.458
And my sister was scared.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.193
They did not want to die either.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:40.661
If I could, I would change
places with them right now.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.063
- You know I would.
- Yes, but you can not.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.466
So only...

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.701
Let's find this book and
let's finish with this.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.044
I have it.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:09.990
Emma, no.

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.096
Emma, we have to burn it.

01:22:24.674 --> 01:22:26.874
Emma!

01:22:26.876 --> 01:22:28.809
Do not! Take the book! You
have to destroy book!

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:29.910
Go!

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:31.312
- Let me!
- Do not!

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:32.413
- You have to go!
- Do not!

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:35.449
- Do not leave me! Go!
- Do not!

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:36.650
You can not have it!

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:39.887
Take the gas can! Come on!

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:44.625
Here.

01:22:58.074 --> 01:22:59.106
Do not!

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:00.407
- Do not!
- He caught me!

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:02.977
- Do not.
- You have to leave me.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:04.411
Do not.

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:06.513
- You have to run!
- Leave it alone!

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.818
Go!

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.419
Finish with me, Emma.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:14.121
Do not!

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:16.423
No, Jeremy!

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:17.992
Jeremy!

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.159
Do not!

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:23.263
Get out of there!

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:24.865
Jeremy, no!

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:26.734
Do not! What do you do?

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:28.335
What do you do?

01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:32.072
Jeremy, no!

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:33.474
Do not!

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:35.042
No please!

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.580
This ends with me,
you son of a bitch!

01:23:39.582 --> 01:23:40.862
I'll see you in hell, you idiot!

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:07.608
<i>Clear the area.</i>

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.148
Get away, miss.

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:15.182
Come on.

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.831
10 years later

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:33.100
well, put on your backpack.

01:24:33.102 --> 01:24:34.435
All right.

01:24:34.437 --> 01:24:36.870
Very good.

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:38.739
Monito, do not you
forget something?

01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.307
Thanks mom.

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:41.375
Do not forget your lunch, okay?

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:42.443
Do you have your project?

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:43.544
Yes.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:47.047
Have a nice day at school.

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.082
I will have it.

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.488
Chloe, what is this?

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.824
Amy gave it to me. He
found it on the Internet.

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:13.707
Chloe!

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:16.110
Do not! No no!

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.144
Chloe!

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:19.746
Do not!

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.582
Chloe!

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:22.783
Chloe, no!

01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:25.719
Chloe!
