WEBVTT

03:18.880 --> 03:22.925
Regiment... dismissed!

03:39.544 --> 03:42.547
<i>- We did it!
- You made it.</i>

03:44.716 --> 03:47.302
- You got a fine boy there.
- Thank you.

03:59.231 --> 04:02.109
- Deliveries in the rear.
- I'm picking up Cadet Cutler.

04:02.234 --> 04:05.070
- OK. Pass, sir.
- Thanks.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.713
Who's he?

05:07.301 --> 05:08.719
Smile, everybody.

05:09.887 --> 05:11.555
What's he doing here?

05:11.680 --> 05:15.853
Excuse me.
Can I get you to pay attention?

05:15.978 --> 05:22.359
Forget about him. Pay attention to me.
I'm trying to get a picture here. Smile.

05:25.362 --> 05:29.283
<i>Oh, thanks, Dad.
Hey, are we gonna get to see Ma?</i>

05:29.408 --> 05:32.411
- Is this the Michael Cutler limo?
- Yes, sir.

05:32.536 --> 05:36.874
- Where's my grandfather?
- He'll be arriving at the airport in an hour.

05:36.999 --> 05:39.251
<i>- Cutler!
- Yes, sir!</i>

05:39.377 --> 05:43.297
- The colonel wants to see ya.
- Right away, sir.

05:43.422 --> 05:45.466
Wait here.

06:01.899 --> 06:03.651
- Colonel Finley.
- Sir.

06:11.744 --> 06:13.955
The colonel wishes to see me, sir.

06:15.248 --> 06:19.252
- Your father wishes to, Cadet.
- My father?

06:19.377 --> 06:22.213
Yes. He's come to drive you home.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.757
Hello, Mike.

06:30.596 --> 06:37.228
- I don't have a father, sir.
- This is your father, Michael.

06:38.563 --> 06:41.482
My grandfather has instructed me
to go home with no one

06:41.607 --> 06:44.193
besides himself or my mother.

06:44.318 --> 06:49.240
Your mother has legal custody
over you, Cutler. Not your grandfather.

06:49.365 --> 06:55.204
And it is her request
that your father bring you home.

06:57.165 --> 07:01.043
- Sir, may I ask a question?
- Of course.

07:01.169 --> 07:03.798
May I see some identification
on this man?

07:03.923 --> 07:06.509
That's not called for, Cadet.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.430
That's OK. I'm ready.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.382
Are we going in this? Why can't we fly?

07:45.507 --> 07:49.636
Your mother thought it'd be a good way
for us to get to know each other.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.805
How long will it take?

07:51.930 --> 07:57.729
Well, I have one more pickup and, say,
two, three days we'll be in California.

07:57.854 --> 08:02.150
And your mother doesn't go into surgery,
say, until Wednesday morning.

08:02.275 --> 08:07.239
<i>Do you really think you can
make up ten years in two to three days?</i>

08:10.033 --> 08:12.077
No.

08:15.414 --> 08:18.125
- Here, let me help you.
- I can do it myself.

08:40.981 --> 08:43.942
- I'd like to say something, sir.
- Sure.

08:44.067 --> 08:46.695
This truck is disgusting.

08:46.820 --> 08:52.911
I don't know, Mike. It's just old. Once in a
stretch up to Vegas, this thing got up to...

08:53.036 --> 08:58.125
Sir, there's no need to make
any conversation for my sake.

09:01.003 --> 09:03.589
So much for small talk.

09:07.301 --> 09:10.596
OK. Here we go.

09:34.620 --> 09:38.624
- Can I ask you a question, sir?
- Sure.

09:38.749 --> 09:42.671
How did you get all these pictures of me?

09:42.797 --> 09:46.383
- Well, your mother sent 'em to me.
- Why?

09:46.509 --> 09:50.221
I've been writing to her for a long time
and I asked for pictures

09:50.346 --> 09:52.765
so I could see how you were growing up.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.767
Looks good.

09:56.102 --> 09:59.855
If you two had been writing,
how come I never got a birthday card,

09:59.980 --> 10:02.108
or a letter, or anything?

10:02.233 --> 10:05.277
- What are you saying, Mike?
- I never heard from you.

10:05.403 --> 10:11.033
I've written to you 100 times. Birthdays,
all the time. What do you mean, I never...?

10:11.158 --> 10:15.579
Well, you must have sent 'em to the
wrong address, cos I never got anything.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.585
Could you pull over? I'm feeling sick.

10:21.710 --> 10:25.047
- What's wrong?
- Would you please pull over, sir?

10:31.679 --> 10:34.183
Hey! Mike!

10:36.144 --> 10:38.062
<i>Mike!</i>

10:38.187 --> 10:40.398
<i>Look out!</i>

10:40.523 --> 10:41.566
Mike!

10:41.691 --> 10:43.735
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

10:43.860 --> 10:46.946
- Mike!
- Put a leash on that kid!

10:48.197 --> 10:51.492
Mike, no. No. Mike!

10:55.329 --> 10:59.959
Mike, Mike. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

11:00.084 --> 11:05.757
<i>- Mike. Stop it.
- I hate you.</i>

11:07.049 --> 11:10.720
Then hate me.
We have to start someplace.

11:13.723 --> 11:15.767
OK?

11:18.269 --> 11:21.522
Come on. Let's go back.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.075
- You said you took care of it.
- I did, Mr Cutler, but...

11:30.200 --> 11:33.119
- Forget it. Forget it!
- Yes, sir.

11:33.244 --> 11:38.291
The boy's mother called, Mr Cutler. She
insisted that Michael leave with his father.

11:38.416 --> 11:40.585
Don't you understand?

11:40.710 --> 11:44.130
My daughter is in no condition
to make that kind of a decision.

11:44.255 --> 11:47.342
I didn't fly all the way up here
to be simply told

11:47.467 --> 11:51.262
you turned my grandson
over to that worthless bastard!

11:51.387 --> 11:57.143
I can't tolerate stupidity. I'll bring this up
to the attention of the board.

12:02.023 --> 12:03.817
I'm sorry about the...

12:05.693 --> 12:11.199
- I'm sorry about the jacket.
- It's no problem. You'll get the bill.

12:12.992 --> 12:16.246
<i>I'm sure.</i>

12:16.830 --> 12:20.502
If you're hungry, there's a great place
up here for good steak.

12:20.627 --> 12:22.504
What do you say we stop?

12:22.629 --> 12:25.715
You're going to be a victim
of cholesterol poisoning.

12:25.841 --> 12:29.719
Later in life, you'll just start to rot away.

12:32.264 --> 12:36.476
You're just full of good humour,
aren't you, Mike?

12:36.601 --> 12:39.980
Well, let's try it, anyway.

12:51.908 --> 12:54.119
OK.

12:54.244 --> 12:57.080
- Hey, Linc.
- How you doing, Tom?

12:57.205 --> 12:59.666
Just fine.

12:59.791 --> 13:01.543
- Hook me up?
- No problem.

13:01.668 --> 13:04.463
Let's eat, Mike.

13:07.215 --> 13:09.843
<i>Hey, Linc. Good to see you, man.</i>

13:10.677 --> 13:12.721
<i>Hey, Linc.</i>

13:15.434 --> 13:17.644
How do you like the place, Mike?

13:19.813 --> 13:22.900
I never did like the zoo, sir.

13:23.025 --> 13:24.860
Why don't you sit down?

13:24.985 --> 13:28.697
- Hey, Linc. Hi. How are you doing?
- Hi, Martha. Fine. Fine.

13:28.822 --> 13:32.117
- Martha, this is my kid Mike.
- Well, Mike.

13:32.242 --> 13:36.747
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Ma'am? Whoo! I like that.

13:38.165 --> 13:43.045
- So, what'll it be? A couple of big steaks?
- For me. Mike'll have chicken.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.798
- Fried bird. Sure.
- No. Excuse me.

13:45.923 --> 13:49.176
For a man who exercises,
you don't know much about nutrition.

13:49.301 --> 13:54.681
A fried chicken dinner with mashed
potatoes has 1,000 calories and 50% fat.

13:54.807 --> 13:58.852
These fats have been linked
to heart disease and some cancer.

13:58.977 --> 14:00.687
So, what would you like?

14:00.813 --> 14:04.483
Tuna salad, whole wheat toast
and spring water with lemon.

14:04.608 --> 14:07.822
- OK.
- Double that.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.575
All right.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.787
If you want, we can go
to McDonald's or something.

14:14.912 --> 14:17.164
You Hawk?

14:18.791 --> 14:22.294
- If you're hungry...
- I said, are you Hawk?

14:22.420 --> 14:25.214
- What can I do for you?
- I'm the Smasher.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.428
That's a nice name.

14:30.553 --> 14:34.723
All I've been hearing on the road lately
is this Hawk is the man to beat.

14:34.849 --> 14:38.310
- Can't believe everything you hear.
- I don't believe anything!

14:38.436 --> 14:41.897
<i>- Kill him, Smasher!
- 1,000 says I can tear your arm off.</i>

14:42.022 --> 14:44.859
- You want it?
- Yeah! Yeah! Go on.

14:44.984 --> 14:48.863
<i>- He's trying to back out.
- I said, you want it?</i>

14:52.283 --> 14:53.451
Why not?

14:53.576 --> 14:57.288
Let's get this table ready.
I wanna show this guy something.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.331
- Come on.
- Break his arm off.

14:59.457 --> 15:04.881
- Are you gonna fight that guy?
- I can't talk right now, Mike.

15:05.006 --> 15:07.133
Where are you going?

15:08.968 --> 15:10.386
Gotta go to work.

15:15.975 --> 15:18.478
<i>- Three on the Hawk!
- Four!</i>

15:27.570 --> 15:31.532
Come on, Linc.
Linc, this guy's insane.

15:33.951 --> 15:37.371
<i>- Three on the Hawk.
- Linc, he's yours.</i>

15:40.875 --> 15:44.796
- What are you doing with that guy?
- He's my father.

15:44.921 --> 15:47.215
Too bad.

15:50.051 --> 15:54.933
All right! Start the fight! Start the fight!

15:57.310 --> 15:59.646
Get ready.

15:59.771 --> 16:01.481
Get ready. Go!

16:04.692 --> 16:06.528
Shit.

16:08.029 --> 16:09.239
You ain't got it!

16:09.364 --> 16:12.951
Get him, Linc! Come on, Linc! Get him!

16:20.333 --> 16:22.377
Yeah!

16:24.462 --> 16:29.008
Come on! You can do it! Come on!

16:33.471 --> 16:35.974
Over the top. Come on, over the top!

16:39.227 --> 16:41.312
Aaagh!

16:54.411 --> 16:58.707
Come on, jerk. Give me the money.
Give me the money!

16:58.832 --> 17:03.503
- I ain't givin' you no money. He cheated!
- You wise guy, you.

17:07.799 --> 17:10.469
So you got lucky again, huh, Hawk?

17:10.594 --> 17:14.097
- How you doing, Bull?
- Better than you.

17:15.348 --> 17:18.727
Right now, double or nothing.
What do you say?

17:18.852 --> 17:23.940
- Let's just wait for Vegas.
- Let's do it now. I feel like kicking ass.

17:24.066 --> 17:28.904
- Let's wait till Vegas, OK?
- You ain't got a prayer in Vegas.

17:30.989 --> 17:34.326
<i>We'll see.</i>

17:34.451 --> 17:36.745
Too bad your old man's yellow, kid.

17:39.541 --> 17:42.628
I'll see you in Vegas.

17:43.378 --> 17:45.881
Get out of the way. Back up.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.552
I'm sorry about that, Mike.

17:50.677 --> 17:54.264
You're a hustler. You hustled
that man back there for money.

17:54.389 --> 17:58.060
- No...
- I'd like to call my mother.

18:06.735 --> 18:10.989
You have to give it time, Michael.
You have to be patient.

18:11.115 --> 18:14.701
I know how you feel,
but you must do it. It's important.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.579
I know you want me to do it,
but I don't even know him.

18:17.704 --> 18:23.544
- I want you to try. It's important to me.
- Why? I thought everything was fine.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.839
There's so much more to life
than what you've seen.

18:26.964 --> 18:31.218
<i>- But he left you.
- He had his reasons.</i>

18:31.343 --> 18:37.476
Look, I have to go now, but I want to talk
to your father first, OK? I love you.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.938
OK. I love you too. Bye.

18:42.898 --> 18:46.318
- She wants to talk to you.
- Thanks.

18:48.362 --> 18:51.157
How you doing, honey?

18:51.282 --> 18:54.785
Mike, would you hold that? Thank you.

18:54.910 --> 18:58.873
Hi, honey. How are you?
Yeah, we're having a great time.

18:58.998 --> 19:03.335
Yeah, he's very helpful. As a matter
of fact, he's helping me right now.

19:17.266 --> 19:19.518
That was a nice song.

19:35.536 --> 19:38.790
Mike, I think we're wearing out
this knob here.

19:38.915 --> 19:42.335
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

19:42.460 --> 19:48.257
Are you still dealing drugs, sir? Are you?

19:48.382 --> 19:52.887
- You think of that all by yourself, Mike?
- My grandfather gave me the facts.

19:56.682 --> 20:01.187
The truth is I never did what
your grandfather said I did, Mike.

20:01.312 --> 20:06.192
The only mistake I ever made
was leaving. I admit that.

20:10.238 --> 20:13.991
So how'd you like the arm-wrestling
match back there?

20:14.117 --> 20:18.496
- It's an experience.
- It sure was.

20:32.804 --> 20:34.848
Christina.

20:36.641 --> 20:39.352
How are you, darling?

20:42.564 --> 20:47.318
- Are you angry with me?
- Angry? Have I ever been angry with you?

20:47.444 --> 20:50.113
Tell me the truth.

20:50.238 --> 20:54.117
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not angry.

20:54.242 --> 20:57.454
But I am disappointed.

20:57.579 --> 21:00.957
I just wanted him to know his father.

21:01.082 --> 21:04.294
Michael's father is no good.

21:04.419 --> 21:07.714
Your wanting to bring him
back in this family is all wrong.

21:07.839 --> 21:13.388
Christina, I know you're worried
about leaving Michael alone.

21:13.513 --> 21:17.142
But surely you understand I'm all
the family Michael will ever need.

21:17.267 --> 21:21.772
- You're not his father.
- I have been his father for 12 years!

21:23.815 --> 21:29.780
Let's not talk about this any more.
It's going to turn out all right. Trust me.

21:30.655 --> 21:35.494
Rest now, sweetheart.
I'll come by a little later.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.798
If there are any calls for my daughter,
I wanna know.

21:47.923 --> 21:49.132
Yes, Mr Cutler.

21:49.257 --> 21:51.468
From the reports, they can't find him.

21:51.593 --> 21:54.638
I want my grandson found.
I don't care how you do it. Do it!

21:54.763 --> 21:57.349
Yes, sir.

22:18.831 --> 22:24.128
- Why'd you stop?
- Well, I think we all need a rest.

22:24.253 --> 22:27.131
I don't see a hotel.

22:27.256 --> 22:33.137
Well, Mike, I thought we'd stay in the
truck tonight. A lot of truckers do it.

22:34.930 --> 22:39.476
- If you can do it, I can do it.
- That's the spirit.

22:42.813 --> 22:47.484
- Well, good night, Mike.
- Good night, sir.

22:51.905 --> 22:56.827
By the way, if your neck gets sore tonight,
you can use my shoulder for a pillow.

22:59.582 --> 23:02.835
Thanks anyway, sir,
but... I think I can manage.

23:05.963 --> 23:09.508
- You sure?
- Positive, sir.

23:10.426 --> 23:13.220
Cos I don't mind. It's all right.

23:16.390 --> 23:19.685
Maybe tomorrow, we'll exercise a little bit.

23:19.810 --> 23:21.854
Good night, sir.

23:23.564 --> 23:25.816
Good night, Mike.

23:30.529 --> 23:35.701
I think we'll get along fine, Mike.
You're a good kid.

25:28.443 --> 25:32.405
See how I do this? You put
your wrist into it, you lean forward,

25:32.530 --> 25:36.367
and you put a lot of weight in there.
You have to use your whole body to it.

25:36.493 --> 25:40.540
It's like your whole body
is one piece of machinery. You try it.

25:40.665 --> 25:45.045
That's it. Good grip.
That's right, lean into it.

25:45.170 --> 25:48.548
You can do it.
Keep your wrist straight. Good.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.636
That's it, Mike.
Now put some muscle into it.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.180
There's more to life than just muscles.

25:57.057 --> 26:01.478
- Meaning what?
- Meaning I don't see any books around.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.272
You don't read much, do you?

26:04.397 --> 26:08.944
No offence, but you're just simply
on a different social scale.

26:09.069 --> 26:12.322
Oh, you wanna tell me more
about this social scale?

26:12.447 --> 26:15.992
It's been said that the average
mental age for an adult is 15,

26:16.118 --> 26:18.036
just three years older than I am.

26:18.161 --> 26:21.748
For a trucker, it has to be
in the 11- to 13-year range.

26:21.873 --> 26:25.127
Maybe 14, if they have good genetics.

26:26.378 --> 26:30.048
You know, Mike, it's really
great driving with such a...

26:30.173 --> 26:33.178
tremendous intellectual like you.

26:33.303 --> 26:35.013
It's a real blessing.

26:43.188 --> 26:44.815
Why are you stopping?

26:47.359 --> 26:49.653
You're aggravated, aren't you?

26:49.778 --> 26:52.739
Boy, I passed aggravation
about a mile back.

26:52.865 --> 26:57.578
- Are you gonna get violent?
- Wanna give me a break?

26:57.703 --> 27:00.247
Since you think it takes no brains at all,

27:00.372 --> 27:04.585
and I have to be stupid and abnormal
to drive a truck like this, I tell you what.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.254
Why don't you just
come on over into my seat

27:07.379 --> 27:10.966
and let's see if you can move
this machinery around, OK?

27:11.091 --> 27:13.969
- What?
- Drive, genius.

27:24.062 --> 27:26.358
OK, Mike. We got miles to go.

27:27.359 --> 27:30.488
This is an unfair test.
I've never driven a truck before.

27:30.613 --> 27:33.949
- Child's play.
- Let's see, what's the big deal?

27:34.074 --> 27:39.205
Just step on the clutch,
press the gas and switch the gear.

27:39.330 --> 27:41.832
This is no problem.
I once drove a dune buggy.

27:41.957 --> 27:47.505
Really? Mike, I'm impressed. Really.
This'll be no problem at all.

27:53.636 --> 27:58.766
You're doing great, Mike.
Why don't you turn the key? OK?

27:58.891 --> 28:03.562
Now you see that little
silver button? Push it.

28:06.107 --> 28:10.027
Magic, huh? Well, Mr Dune Buggy,
you ready to drive?

28:10.152 --> 28:14.073
- Mm-hm.
- OK. Push the clutch in all the way.

28:14.198 --> 28:17.201
- Give it a lot of leg.
- I don't have any more.

28:17.326 --> 28:22.458
No, you can do it. Hold it in.
A little bit more. That's it. Good.

28:22.583 --> 28:27.338
Now, give it some gas. Are you ready?

28:27.463 --> 28:32.718
OK. Here we go, Captain Dune Buggy.
Blastoff, right? Go.

28:35.304 --> 28:37.390
Gas, Mike. A little more gas.

28:40.643 --> 28:45.857
- You got an interesting style, Mike.
- Ooh. Whoa.

28:45.982 --> 28:47.608
Hold it steady, Mike.

28:47.733 --> 28:51.904
Good. Good. Get it out there.

28:53.322 --> 28:56.159
I'm getting a little sick, Mike.

28:56.284 --> 28:59.996
I always wanted to be a milkshake.

29:01.289 --> 29:05.376
We're hitting a lot of turbulence.
Let's shift to second gear, OK?

29:05.501 --> 29:07.628
- Ready? Clutch all the way in?
- Yeah.

29:07.754 --> 29:12.135
Give it some gas. You ready? OK, shift.

29:13.428 --> 29:19.225
Wow. I'm impressed. Not bad.
I think we have a natural here.

29:19.350 --> 29:23.354
OK. I think you're about ready
to do it by yourself.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.984
- No!
- Gotta go now, friend.

29:28.109 --> 29:30.278
Go on. Hold it steady.

29:30.403 --> 29:34.407
This is great. I'm really doing it.
This is great!

29:36.034 --> 29:38.787
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

29:38.912 --> 29:41.790
- What, sir?
- Smiling.

29:44.959 --> 29:48.338
You're a real natural.
Keep your eye on the road.

29:50.340 --> 29:53.760
- Here comes Mike.
- All right!

30:00.183 --> 30:05.357
No, no. You stay out of it
from now on. Right.

30:05.482 --> 30:08.568
- Tim?
- Yes, sir.

30:13.698 --> 30:17.786
We're going to have to deal
with this in another fashion.

30:18.870 --> 30:21.456
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

30:21.581 --> 30:23.750
That cake didn't have much of a chance.

30:23.875 --> 30:27.212
- I was real hungry.
- Driving a truck can do that to you.

30:27.337 --> 30:30.465
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

30:30.590 --> 30:33.885
- Can I call Mom?
- That's a good idea.

30:36.304 --> 30:38.849
You feel good?

30:38.974 --> 30:43.311
- Yeah, why?
- I mean, do you feel... strong?

30:43.437 --> 30:46.189
Why?

30:46.314 --> 30:48.942
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

30:49.067 --> 30:51.278
You'll see.
Excuse me.

30:52.904 --> 30:55.866
- Did any of you boys ever arm-wrestle?
- Why?

30:56.825 --> 31:00.831
I got a kid here that could beat any one
of you guys two out of three times.

31:00.956 --> 31:04.418
- He's a practical joker. Sorry.
- He's just a shy kid.

31:04.543 --> 31:08.046
As a matter of fact, I'm so sure
I'm willing to put money on it.

31:08.172 --> 31:11.425
Kid, if I couldn't beat you, I'd kill myself.

31:12.426 --> 31:14.386
This is getting too intense.

31:14.511 --> 31:18.015
- You don't have a chance against this kid.
- Yes, he does.

31:18.140 --> 31:21.101
Ten to one odds.
Your one against my ten. Fair?

31:21.226 --> 31:24.271
All right. Let's go.
Ten to one odds. Right here.

31:24.396 --> 31:28.442
Two out of three times.
You should take that off. That's not fair.

31:28.567 --> 31:31.236
- You'll take him easy.
- No gloves allowed.

31:31.361 --> 31:34.531
OK. Concentrate, Mike. You can do it.

31:34.656 --> 31:39.328
All right, let's start. Ready, wimp?
His skin feels like a girl's.

31:39.453 --> 31:40.704
- He is one.
- Probably.

31:40.829 --> 31:43.248
Don't listen to 'em. You hear?

31:43.373 --> 31:45.834
- Kill him.
- You're gonna show 'em now.

31:45.959 --> 31:50.674
You're gonna show 'em. You're gonna
do it. Over the top, Mike. Ready?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.218
Start. Come on, Mike.

31:52.343 --> 31:56.931
- Break his arm.
- Get this little wuss! Blow the fruit away!

31:57.056 --> 32:00.392
- Come on, man! All the way!
- Come on!

32:04.230 --> 32:06.732
- Yeah!
- Yeah, man!

32:07.983 --> 32:11.278
- Aw, look at the baby.
- Aw, little baby. Little baby.

32:11.403 --> 32:13.697
- Two out of three.
- Ten out of ten.

32:13.823 --> 32:16.283
- Any day, man.
- We'll take anything, man.

32:16.408 --> 32:18.452
Mike!

32:22.248 --> 32:24.250
What are you trying to do?

32:24.375 --> 32:27.545
All you wanted to do was embarrass me.
You did it, OK?

32:27.670 --> 32:30.005
Grandfather said you were a loser.

32:30.131 --> 32:33.384
You're trying to make me one
and I hate you for it!

32:33.509 --> 32:37.680
Mike, I don't care what your
grandfather thinks about me, OK?

32:37.805 --> 32:39.265
All I care about is you.

32:39.390 --> 32:43.855
Now you lost back there because you
beat yourself. You let yourself get beat.

32:43.980 --> 32:49.026
I know you can do it. You're a special kid.
You're my boy, do you understand?

32:49.152 --> 32:53.614
But you're also a spoiled rich brat who's
always had everything done for him.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.451
It's time to do it for yourself,
and you can do it.

32:56.576 --> 33:01.456
I'm telling you, the world meets nobody
halfway. Do you understand that?

33:01.581 --> 33:06.752
If you want it, Mike, you gotta take it.
Do you hear me? You gotta take it.

33:06.878 --> 33:09.338
Go in there and try. I know you can win.

33:09.464 --> 33:12.091
But even if you don't, so what?
So you lose.

33:12.216 --> 33:17.388
As long as you lose like a winner, it
doesn't matter. Cos you did it with dignity.

33:17.513 --> 33:20.308
If you don't go in there,
you're gonna be sorry.

33:20.433 --> 33:23.561
You'll regret it your whole life,
you know what I mean?

33:24.645 --> 33:28.024
Go on. I know you can do it.
Will you do it for me?

33:30.067 --> 33:32.612
Come on. Let's get him.

33:33.696 --> 33:36.741
You can do it. You can beat him.

33:36.868 --> 33:40.038
You're twice as strong as he is.
You just gotta believe.

33:40.163 --> 33:42.999
You understand? All right.

33:43.124 --> 33:45.752
I thought you said he was strong.

33:45.877 --> 33:50.715
Well, my boy was just feeling generous.
Now it's time to go to work. Huh, Mike?

33:57.639 --> 34:01.434
- It's time to go to work, kid.
- Yeah.

34:02.102 --> 34:04.687
- Does he think he can take me?
- I don't think so.

34:04.813 --> 34:06.564
- Lock wrists.
- What a joke.

34:06.689 --> 34:08.650
Through the table. Smash him.

34:08.775 --> 34:12.362
This is gonna hurt, wimp.
What do you think of that?

34:13.446 --> 34:16.074
- I think your breath stinks.
- Go!

34:16.199 --> 34:18.784
<i>Come on, Mike. That's good.</i>

34:18.909 --> 34:22.621
That's good, Mike. Come on.
Come on, Mike. Drop the weight.

34:22.746 --> 34:26.668
Over the top, Mike. Come on.
Get tough. Pump it, kid. Pump it, kid.

34:26.793 --> 34:29.504
You got him, Mike.
You got him! You got him!

34:29.629 --> 34:33.760
Come on, Mike. A little bit more.
You got him! You got him! You got him!

34:33.885 --> 34:37.639
All right! All right. Way to go.

34:37.764 --> 34:42.101
- Come on, man. Do it again!
- He cheated. Come on. One more time.

34:42.226 --> 34:44.438
Let's go, Mike. Right away.

34:44.563 --> 34:48.692
- I'm gonna break your arm, punk!
- Come on. Get mad, get mad. Ready? Go.

34:48.817 --> 34:52.821
Come on, Mike. You can beat him, Mike.
Harder, Mike. Over the top.

34:52.946 --> 34:57.993
Pump it, kid. Pump it, kid. The power,
Mike. The power, Mike. Over the top.

34:58.118 --> 35:01.705
Hey! Good, Mike. All right. Way to go.

35:01.830 --> 35:06.960
You're a tough little sucker, aren't you?
That was great. Pay up now.

35:07.085 --> 35:10.714
- Money, please.
- Money.

35:13.258 --> 35:16.970
- How did he do that?
- Good genetics.

35:17.095 --> 35:20.807
- Thanks. Let's go.
- Let's talk to Mom.

35:20.932 --> 35:24.730
- Come on. Right now!
- I'll beat you every day, man.

35:25.105 --> 35:29.610
- I drove Dad's truck and I'm a good driver.
- Great driver.

35:29.735 --> 35:34.323
And I had this arm-wrestling match with
some guy who was bigger, maybe 5'6".

35:34.448 --> 35:37.242
- Bigger.
- No, 5'9".

35:37.367 --> 35:38.494
Bigger.

35:38.619 --> 35:42.247
Mom, you wouldn't believe it.
This guy was a monster!

35:42.372 --> 35:46.627
Oh, that's good, darling.
I'm so proud of you.

35:46.752 --> 35:51.089
Is your father there?
Let me speak to him, OK?

35:51.215 --> 35:54.968
<i>- I love you, sweetheart.
- OK. I love you too.</i>

35:55.093 --> 35:59.181
- She sounds so weak.
- She'll be OK.

35:59.306 --> 36:01.767
- I'm gonna be outside.
- OK, champ.

36:01.892 --> 36:07.231
Hi, honey. Oh, yeah, it was a great idea
he and I spending time like this together.

36:07.356 --> 36:11.151
I hope so. I know it won't be easy.

36:11.276 --> 36:16.115
Oh, no, everything's gonna be great.
I know it is. So, how you feeling?

36:16.240 --> 36:21.247
Linc, whatever happens,
I want you to stay with him.

36:21.372 --> 36:28.379
I know how difficult it is for you, but it's
really important. He needs you, honey.

36:28.504 --> 36:29.755
I will.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.342
Please try to make things work
between you and my father.

36:33.467 --> 36:39.849
He's too set in his ways to change, so
maybe you can try and understand him.

36:39.974 --> 36:42.059
I'll try.

36:42.184 --> 36:46.021
OK. I can't wait to see you both.

36:47.523 --> 36:51.152
Christina, he's a great kid.
And I'll see you soon, OK?

36:51.277 --> 36:52.778
OK.

36:52.903 --> 36:57.074
- Dad!
- OK. Bye. Mike!

36:57.199 --> 37:00.369
- Dad!
- Mike!

37:00.494 --> 37:04.957
- Mike! Mike!
- Dad!

37:05.082 --> 37:07.418
<i>Come on.</i>

37:17.388 --> 37:21.058
Dad! Dad!

37:22.477 --> 37:24.645
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!

37:29.609 --> 37:31.152
- Come on, Dad!
- Quiet, kid.

37:39.494 --> 37:40.787
He's still coming.

37:42.622 --> 37:44.582
- Oh, shit. Here he comes.
- Dad!

38:07.774 --> 38:10.485
Come on! Let's get the hell
out of here! Hurry!

38:13.071 --> 38:17.033
He's staying with me!
You tell him that! You tell him!

38:18.201 --> 38:20.703
- You OK? You all right?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

38:20.829 --> 38:23.289
- I'm all right.
- Yeah, you'll live.

38:23.414 --> 38:27.710
- Thanks. Come on. You sure you're OK?
- Yeah.

38:29.129 --> 38:34.717
- Who were those guys anyway?
- Better ask your grandfather.

38:35.677 --> 38:38.179
<i>- Look at my truck.
- Oh, man.</i>

38:51.025 --> 38:53.987
- I got here as soon as I could, Jason.
- Yes.

38:54.112 --> 38:57.909
- We don't have much of a custody case.
- Why the hell is that?

38:58.034 --> 39:00.245
I had my best researchers run down

39:00.370 --> 39:03.999
every applicable court case
for the last 100 years.

39:04.124 --> 39:09.629
Bottom line, Jason: no judge is going
to award you custody of Michael.

39:09.754 --> 39:12.924
The court will give him to Hawk
unless he can't support him.

39:13.049 --> 39:16.386
How can he support him?
The son of a bitch lost everything.

39:16.511 --> 39:21.558
He can't even support himself! Anyway,
there's always a way to bend the law.

39:21.683 --> 39:25.061
Isn't it your job?!
Why don't you find the loophole?

39:25.187 --> 39:27.564
I want my boy.

39:40.243 --> 39:41.661
- Come on.
- Over the top.

39:41.787 --> 39:44.498
<i>Over the top.</i>

39:45.624 --> 39:49.546
Oh, oh. Mercy, mercy, mercy.

39:50.839 --> 39:54.009
You're getting too good.
You're gonna be a great one, kid.

39:54.134 --> 39:58.430
- Almost as good as you, right?
- Well... I think you'll be better than me.

39:58.555 --> 40:02.309
- Think you're gonna do good in Vegas?
- I'm betting on it.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.938
I'd like to get enough money together
and buy a small company,

40:06.063 --> 40:10.275
and hire some smart guy
like you to be president.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.736
- That's not a bad idea.
- It's a great idea.

40:12.861 --> 40:14.822
But what if you lose?

40:14.947 --> 40:18.283
Hey, Mike,
you're not supposed to say that.

40:18.408 --> 40:22.830
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

40:22.955 --> 40:24.706
Why'd you leave us?

40:26.208 --> 40:28.252
Well...

40:30.045 --> 40:32.464
I had some reasons.

40:32.589 --> 40:34.466
That's not an answer.

40:34.591 --> 40:38.095
All I can say, Mike, is I made a mistake.
I know that.

40:38.804 --> 40:42.560
You know, sometimes it happens in life.
We all make mistakes.

40:45.521 --> 40:47.565
But it won't happen again.

40:50.776 --> 40:53.446
- Yeah, you're gonna be a great one.
- Think so?

40:53.571 --> 40:58.826
Yes. I'm glad I'm not going
against you, tough guy.

41:06.834 --> 41:11.755
We saved the patient.
But before in the ICU...

41:12.840 --> 41:14.967
Well, we had a little problem.

41:15.593 --> 41:17.428
- You OK?
- Yeah. How do I look?

41:17.553 --> 41:20.139
You look great.
You're not nervous, are you?

41:20.264 --> 41:23.434
Come on, let's go see her.

41:27.563 --> 41:31.942
Excuse me, could you tell me what room
Mrs Christina Hawk is in, please?

41:32.067 --> 41:34.278
- What is she admitted for?
- Heart surgery.

41:34.403 --> 41:37.116
She'd probably be in a private room.

41:40.077 --> 41:43.831
- Can I ask who you are?
- I'm her husband.

41:43.956 --> 41:47.919
Possibly you'd rather talk to one
of the doctors on the case.

41:48.044 --> 41:51.798
- Why, what's wrong?
- Excuse me.

42:14.028 --> 42:20.785
Mr Hawk, I'm sorry. Your wife died
this afternoon in the operating room.

42:21.702 --> 42:23.746
No.

42:26.165 --> 42:28.209
No.

42:39.013 --> 42:40.348
Mike.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.144
Mike!

42:48.731 --> 42:50.775
Mike.

42:52.110 --> 42:55.321
If you wouldn't have come to pick me up,
I would've seen her.

42:55.447 --> 42:59.200
I wouldn't be riding around in that truck
while she was dying.

42:59.325 --> 43:01.661
Nobody knew, Mike.

43:01.786 --> 43:05.540
You've never been around
when anybody needed you.

43:05.665 --> 43:12.172
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi, take me
to the Cutler estate. I'm going home.

43:12.297 --> 43:13.590
Mike.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.343
Mike!

43:22.559 --> 43:26.855
<i>We are gathered here to commit
the body of Christina Marie Cutler Hawk</i>

43:26.980 --> 43:30.400
to the ground from which it came.

43:30.525 --> 43:34.112
We commend her soul to the Lord

43:34.237 --> 43:35.906
that in His mercy...

43:37.699 --> 43:41.077
That must be the husband.

43:46.833 --> 43:51.880
...that in His mercy,
she may attain everlasting life.

43:52.005 --> 43:56.718
And now, let us pray with the Psalmist.

43:56.843 --> 44:00.430
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want. "

44:00.555 --> 44:04.226
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures. "

44:04.351 --> 44:07.479
"He leadeth me beside the still waters. "

44:08.438 --> 44:10.273
"He restoreth my soul. "

44:10.398 --> 44:15.113
"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake. "

44:15.239 --> 44:19.118
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life

44:19.243 --> 44:23.247
and will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever. "

45:42.286 --> 45:43.621
Yes?

45:44.497 --> 45:48.584
- I'd like to talk to Jason Cutler, please.
- You're not wanted here.

45:49.960 --> 45:53.214
Would you tell him Lincoln Hawk
would like to talk to him?

45:53.339 --> 45:55.758
Like I said, you're not wanted here.

46:00.429 --> 46:02.809
I want to see my boy.

46:03.851 --> 46:05.144
Move it out.

46:09.273 --> 46:14.028
Move. Get this thing the hell
out of here before I call the police.

46:38.219 --> 46:41.389
That guy ain't coming back. He's a loser.

46:55.071 --> 46:59.284
<i>Stop! What are you doing?!
Get back here!</i>

47:10.086 --> 47:13.339
<i>Call the cops!
I'm going around back!</i>

47:16.634 --> 47:20.305
Mike! Mike!

47:20.430 --> 47:22.390
Hawk!

47:22.515 --> 47:25.018
What the hell have you done?

47:25.143 --> 47:27.187
Mike.

47:28.605 --> 47:31.983
Come with me, please. Mike, please.

47:32.108 --> 47:36.779
Do you actually think that you can
get away with what you've done?

47:36.905 --> 47:40.950
You think you can come in here, destroy
my home and take Michael with you?

47:41.075 --> 47:45.288
Michael Cutler is my boy!
You deserted him years ago!

47:45.413 --> 47:50.253
And that's a fact that you can't change
no matter what you do! Damn you!

47:51.087 --> 47:53.131
Damn you.

47:54.007 --> 47:56.134
Dad! Dad!

47:57.969 --> 48:00.806
Come on, let him go!

48:00.931 --> 48:03.934
- Go to your room.
- Please! Dad!

48:04.059 --> 48:06.812
- Go to your room.
- Come on, Grandfather!

48:09.981 --> 48:13.151
Go to your room now! Go!

48:13.276 --> 48:16.571
Mike. Mike.

48:16.696 --> 48:20.116
We got him. Let him go.
Keep his arms behind him.

48:21.660 --> 48:26.581
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent...

48:26.706 --> 48:28.875
All the way out. Slowly.

49:07.833 --> 49:09.877
Move your ass.

49:11.837 --> 49:14.715
You Hawk? Let's go.

49:16.341 --> 49:18.385
Wait here.

49:23.307 --> 49:25.476
Straight ahead.

49:25.601 --> 49:28.228
There's somebody here
to see you, Hawk.

49:41.494 --> 49:42.995
Yeah, right over there.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.164
Sit down.

49:50.461 --> 49:55.174
I'll make this brief, Hawk. I'm Tim
Salanger, Mr Cutler's personal secretary.

49:55.299 --> 49:58.594
As you can see, you've got
a serious problem on your hands.

49:58.719 --> 50:03.682
More than ever now, you'll need money
for attorneys, additional expenses.

50:03.808 --> 50:10.064
What we want is for you to leave the state.
Don't come back, we won't prosecute.

50:10.189 --> 50:14.735
If you decide to contest the whole matter
of legal custody, you won't have a prayer.

50:14.860 --> 50:17.863
We retain the finest law firms.

50:20.825 --> 50:23.786
That's it. What do you say?

50:26.580 --> 50:31.295
- What's Mike say?
- Ask him yourself.

50:39.178 --> 50:41.222
Michael.

50:49.772 --> 50:51.732
At ease, Mike.

50:58.531 --> 51:02.702
Now, you're not gonna tell me
to leave too, are you?

51:02.827 --> 51:04.120
No.

51:04.245 --> 51:07.957
That's good. I was beginning
to think I wasn't popular.

51:11.878 --> 51:14.464
I don't know what to think.

51:16.382 --> 51:19.677
Mike, I know you don't trust me.

51:20.847 --> 51:23.683
I don't blame you.
I haven't earned that yet.

51:27.604 --> 51:31.149
I just feel like I have a home here.

51:31.274 --> 51:33.067
You know, I...

51:34.152 --> 51:37.071
I mean, if I went with you,

51:37.197 --> 51:39.282
where would we go?

51:39.407 --> 51:41.576
Where would we end up?

51:46.289 --> 51:50.043
Together is all I can guarantee.

51:52.170 --> 51:56.424
You say this now, and then you leave.

52:00.303 --> 52:07.352
Mike, I'm just a father who messed up
pretty bad, I know that.

52:07.477 --> 52:11.105
I've done things real wrong.

52:11.231 --> 52:16.571
Now I want to try to fix
everything up as best as I can.

52:18.031 --> 52:21.409
And I want to

52:21.535 --> 52:25.747
give you what's inside of me.

52:25.872 --> 52:30.585
I may not have much
and I may never have a lot.

52:30.710 --> 52:37.050
But I've got something inside
I want to give to the only person

52:37.175 --> 52:39.511
who means something to me.

52:39.636 --> 52:42.931
You. You.

52:50.021 --> 52:52.023
I can't.

52:53.108 --> 52:55.402
I can't go with you.

53:01.908 --> 53:04.202
Can't?

53:05.287 --> 53:07.541
I'm sorry.

53:25.893 --> 53:28.103
I understand.

53:37.488 --> 53:42.326
Mike, I want you to remember something.

53:46.205 --> 53:50.250
The world meets nobody halfway,
remember that.

53:52.336 --> 53:58.300
You gotta do what's best for you.
Always do that.

54:14.109 --> 54:16.153
Should I draw up the papers?

54:23.452 --> 54:25.329
Yeah.

55:36.444 --> 55:39.655
I appreciate your feelings
about your truck.

55:39.780 --> 55:46.287
Best offer I can make -
cash, though - 7,000.

55:46.414 --> 55:50.960
- Take it or leave it.
- Not giving me much of a choice.

55:51.085 --> 55:54.047
OK, you got a deal.

55:57.467 --> 56:01.888
- I'd like to keep the hawk, though, OK?
- Take it.

56:42.389 --> 56:46.560
<i>Good morning. I'd like
to welcome all of you to this year's...</i>

57:02.742 --> 57:06.037
- What are the odds on Lincoln Hawk?
- The odds on Hawk?

57:06.163 --> 57:08.373
Lincoln Hawk's 20 to one.

57:09.666 --> 57:12.752
20 to one, pal. Real long shot.

57:13.962 --> 57:18.008
- I'd like to bet 7,000 on him.
- That's what I call gambling.

57:31.688 --> 57:34.443
Linc Hawk.

57:34.568 --> 57:36.361
John Grizzly, 238.

57:53.921 --> 57:56.507
190? Thanks.

57:56.632 --> 58:03.013
That's wrong. Excuse me, buddy.
Hold on a second. John Grizzly, 238.

58:20.823 --> 58:23.534
<i>Italian competitors, report to your coach.</i>

58:25.911 --> 58:30.000
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Stop!

58:30.125 --> 58:33.420
<i>Arm wrestling is a combination
of strength and technique,</i>

58:33.546 --> 58:39.426
<i>coupled with mental attitude
and dedication.</i>

58:43.764 --> 58:47.810
<i>- Come on!
- Move it! Go!</i>

58:47.935 --> 58:50.729
<i>Soon, the preliminaries will be under way.</i>

58:50.855 --> 58:53.357
One, two...

59:06.912 --> 59:10.541
<i>Hey, you idiot!</i>

59:10.666 --> 59:15.796
<i>Welcome to the arm wrestling
world championship competition.</i>

59:20.553 --> 59:23.764
<i>There are different weight classes
for men and women.</i>

59:23.890 --> 59:29.145
<i>They come from all over the world:
Japan, France, Italy, Switzerland.</i>

59:29.270 --> 59:32.190
<i>Truly the best arm wrestlers
in the entire world.</i>

59:34.108 --> 59:38.905
One reminder, once again,
this is a double elimination competition.

59:39.030 --> 59:41.199
<i>You have to lose twice to be out.</i>

59:41.324 --> 59:45.620
<i>In other words, if you lose once,
you still have one more chance.</i>

59:45.745 --> 59:50.458
<i>OK. The preliminary rounds this morning
and the men's finals tonight.</i>

59:50.583 --> 59:54.962
<i>And don't forget the women. They're
competing for $50,000 in prize money.</i>

59:55.963 --> 59:58.633
<i>Are we ready, referees?
Start the competition!</i>

59:58.758 --> 01:00:01.177
Good luck to all of you!

01:00:01.302 --> 01:00:03.304
Ready? Go!

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:04.931
Ready? Go!

01:00:07.225 --> 01:00:11.437
You ain't shit!

01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:19.697
- Winner, Bull Hurley.
- Yeah!

01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:23.660
<i>A win for the five-time
world champion, Bull Hurley!</i>

01:00:28.915 --> 01:00:30.416
Go!

01:00:33.378 --> 01:00:35.338
Winner!

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.054
That's a winner!

01:00:47.267 --> 01:00:50.937
<i>Frenchman AndrÃ© Bouvier
and a newcomer, Lincoln Hawk.</i>

01:00:51.062 --> 01:00:55.692
<i>And Lincoln Hawk takes the win!
He'll be one to watch.</i>

01:00:55.817 --> 01:00:58.278
<i>On to the teamster.
Harry Bosco has the win.</i>

01:01:03.283 --> 01:01:07.164
Hey, boy. You just can't leave
this truck here like that.

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:09.416
You can keep it.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:13.211
Hey, you! Come back here!
Come here, you!

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:18.884
<i>...Billy Bob from Texas, the southern
champion. He'll be tough to beat here.</i>

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.855
There. There's our car.
Take me to Mr Cutler's plane.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.106
Go!

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.399
- Go!
- Go!

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.318
Go!

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:45.285
<i>- Winner!
- We have trouble with our German friend.</i>

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.621
<i>Looks like an injury on table three.</i>

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.460
Ready? Go!

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:54.669
Winner!

01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:07.768
Chicken shit.

01:02:12.856 --> 01:02:16.193
<i>We're already down
to the last 32 competitors.</i>

01:02:16.318 --> 01:02:21.073
<i>Bull Hurley. Looks like he's gonna be here
for the finals. He's still the man to beat.</i>

01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:24.952
He's not to make it to the Hilton.
Is that understood?

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:28.539
Come on!

01:02:40.467 --> 01:02:43.011
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:51.939
Winner!

01:02:54.483 --> 01:02:57.903
<i>And that concludes
the women's competition.</i>

01:02:58.028 --> 01:02:59.655
<i>Mr John Grizzly!</i>

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.495
- Winner!
- Winner!

01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:13.294
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:16.797
Welcome back to our
world championship competition.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.847
We're approaching the main event.
First of all, the semifinals.

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:27.975
Fighting will take place
on these four tables

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.062
and the eight best arm wrestlers
in the world will be competing.

01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:41.614
- There's Michael.
- I'll cover the back.

01:03:42.573 --> 01:03:47.914
<i>They've come from every
nation on earth. 500 competitors started.</i>

01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:50.666
Now we're down to the final eight.

01:03:57.173 --> 01:04:00.134
<i>Let me remind you.
Let me remind you, please.</i>

01:04:00.259 --> 01:04:05.473
This is a double elimination competition.
If you lose twice, you're out.

01:04:05.598 --> 01:04:08.601
Double elimination competition.

01:04:16.526 --> 01:04:23.491
They've come from everywhere for
a chance to win $100,000 in prize money.

01:04:23.658 --> 01:04:30.456
They will also have the opportunity to win
a $250,000 Volvo White tractor truck.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:37.088
Right now, though, let's introduce
our eight semifinalists.

01:04:37.213 --> 01:04:39.884
They're the best in the
world of arm wrestling.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.095
Let's introduce John Grizzly,

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.266
three-time winner from the
World Arm Wrestling Association.

01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:51.354
When I get to the table, that person, I don't
care who they are, is my mortal enemy.

01:04:51.479 --> 01:04:52.480
I hate them.

01:04:52.605 --> 01:04:55.525
John Grizzly, right here. John Grizzly.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:59.028
Also coming up here, Mad Dog Madison.

01:04:59.154 --> 01:05:02.490
I'm not so enthused about people
patting me on the back,

01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:06.578
saying "You're the best. "
I don't need people to do that to me.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:11.124
If I win, it's just because I wanted
to be the best, one time in my life.

01:05:11.249 --> 01:05:13.793
Mad Dog Madison.

01:05:13.918 --> 01:05:16.421
Harry Bosco, right here. Harry Bosco.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:22.051
My whole body is an engine. This is a
fireplug and I'm going to light him up.

01:05:22.177 --> 01:05:25.263
<i>Harry Bosco!</i>

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:29.642
The Canadian champion,
two years running - Carl Adams.

01:05:29.767 --> 01:05:33.023
I should be able
to blow them away real easy.

01:05:33.148 --> 01:05:37.194
There's a lot more technique involved,
and you can't beat experience.

01:05:37.319 --> 01:05:41.156
<i>Carl Adams, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:05:41.948 --> 01:05:46.578
And the newcomer from the truckers'
division, Lincoln Hawk, over here.

01:05:46.703 --> 01:05:50.540
To tell you the truth, the truck
is the most important thing for me.

01:05:50.665 --> 01:05:56.880
I don't really... It doesn't matter
if I become the champion or anything.

01:05:57.005 --> 01:06:02.010
That's not the most important...
I... I need this truck.

01:06:02.135 --> 01:06:05.430
<i>Lincoln Hawk,
from the truckers' division.</i>

01:06:06.556 --> 01:06:09.684
Finally, five-time
arm wrestling world champion...

01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:11.436
- Yeah!
... Bull Hurley!

01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:14.731
<i>Let's hear it for Bull.</i>

01:06:14.856 --> 01:06:20.403
I drive a truck and arm wrestle. It's
what I love to do, it's what I do best.

01:06:20.529 --> 01:06:22.906
Yeah!

01:06:23.031 --> 01:06:29.122
Bull, ladies and gentlemen, trying for an
unprecedented sixth championship title.

01:06:29.248 --> 01:06:34.711
Being number one is everything.
There is no second place. Second sucks.

01:06:34.837 --> 01:06:38.465
And now, semifinalists,
will you please take the tables?

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:43.595
This is a double elimination tournament.
Two losses and you're out.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.347
Yeah, John! Come on!

01:06:45.472 --> 01:06:50.811
All right, gentlemen. Let's start
the competition. Good luck to all of you.

01:06:50.936 --> 01:06:53.438
We have Linc Hawk
and John Grizzly competing.

01:06:53.564 --> 01:06:56.149
- Get him off my thumb.
- This'll be a tough match.

01:06:56.275 --> 01:06:58.193
Get him off my thumb.

01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:04.491
<i>Hey, what the hell
is that kid doing there?</i>

01:07:06.952 --> 01:07:09.872
<i>There are two basic styles...</i>

01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:14.585
- He's still got my thumb.
- His thumb's OK.

01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.919
Ready? Go!

01:07:19.175 --> 01:07:21.260
Watch your position!

01:07:31.353 --> 01:07:34.106
- Winner, Harry Bosco!
- Yeah!

01:07:35.983 --> 01:07:37.484
Winner!

01:07:38.986 --> 01:07:42.364
<i>On table number two,
Lincoln Hawk and John Grizzly!</i>

01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:46.118
<i>This should be a tough match.
Grizzly's getting him over the top.</i>

01:07:46.243 --> 01:07:49.914
<i>Grizzly looks like he's got
Linc Hawk in trouble.</i>

01:08:43.803 --> 01:08:47.305
John Grizzly is our winner.
Grizzly has won again.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.977
And the newcomer, Lincoln Hawk,
has lost his first finals match.

01:08:51.102 --> 01:08:53.312
Remember, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:53.437 --> 01:08:58.609
This is a double elimination. Each of these
semifinalists have another chance.

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.654
You have to lose twice
to be out of the competition.

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:13.960
Get him up to my suite.
I wanna talk to him.

01:09:15.044 --> 01:09:18.214
Yeah. A little harder.

01:09:19.465 --> 01:09:21.843
I hope I didn't tear anything.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.430
Yeah, that's better.

01:09:28.224 --> 01:09:30.100
- Hawk?
- What do you want?

01:09:30.225 --> 01:09:35.814
Mr Cutler wants a word with you.
He's waiting in the presidential suite.

01:09:37.108 --> 01:09:38.359
- Ed?
- Yeah.

01:09:38.484 --> 01:09:42.906
- How long before I go on again?
- You got about a half-hour.

01:09:43.031 --> 01:09:44.448
I'll be there.

01:09:56.044 --> 01:09:57.589
Come in, Hawk.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.429
You want a drink?
You don't have to stay sharp.

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:09.309
I understand you already
lost your first match.

01:10:09.434 --> 01:10:14.105
- What do you want, Cutler?
- We don't have to be enemies.

01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:18.985
I never wanted to be your enemy.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:22.364
All right, then. Let's get right to it.

01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:27.452
With Christina gone...

01:10:27.577 --> 01:10:32.332
I have no family left in my life,
except for Michael.

01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:36.962
You never had anything,
so you have nothing to lose.

01:10:37.838 --> 01:10:41.258
Hawk, you can believe what you want to.

01:10:41.383 --> 01:10:46.096
But you're a deserter, plain and simple.
You deserted your wife and your son.

01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:47.889
You were tearing us apart.

01:10:48.014 --> 01:10:51.687
Don't try to clear your conscience
at my expense.

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:55.858
You're a liar. You deserted them.

01:10:57.609 --> 01:11:01.363
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with you yet.

01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:07.744
Come on outside.
I want to show you something. Come on!

01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:24.303
Down there in the parking lot
in front of the hotel.

01:11:24.428 --> 01:11:28.807
That's the finest rig that money can buy.
If you want it, it's yours.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.062
Here's a cheque for $500,000.
Take it and get the hell out of my life.

01:11:34.188 --> 01:11:38.400
What are you trying to do? I gave you
custody of the boy, I signed papers.

01:11:38.525 --> 01:11:41.445
- What more do you want?
- I'm making things easy for you.

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:44.533
You don't need Michael
as a meal ticket any more.

01:11:44.658 --> 01:11:49.163
So take the truck, take the money.
Start a new life. Start your own family!

01:11:49.288 --> 01:11:50.706
I got a family.

01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:55.878
When this is over, I'm coming to get him.

01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:02.218
- You're going back on your word.
- Yeah.

01:12:02.343 --> 01:12:05.888
You signed over custody. He'll never
go with you because you're a loser.

01:12:06.013 --> 01:12:08.224
You've always been a loser!

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.564
- Mr Cutler is talking to you.
- I'm through talking.

01:12:30.371 --> 01:12:34.333
<i>We continue
with our semifinal series of matches.</i>

01:12:34.458 --> 01:12:38.172
<i>- You're mine.
- This is a double elimination tournament.</i>

01:12:38.297 --> 01:12:42.343
<i>Any competitor who loses twice out
of the eight on these four tables...</i>

01:12:42.468 --> 01:12:45.763
I'm going through you
like gas through a funnel.

01:12:54.772 --> 01:12:58.025
<i>You're mine, mister.</i>

01:12:58.776 --> 01:13:02.154
- Get him off of my thumb.
- Keep your elbow in the cup!

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.615
- I don't see it.
- Put your elbow in the cup!

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.577
I don't see it.

01:13:07.702 --> 01:13:09.036
Ready? Go!

01:13:35.607 --> 01:13:41.487
<i>Mad Dog Madison will be
the next opponent for Linc Hawk.</i>

01:13:44.407 --> 01:13:48.912
<i>Bull Hurley has beaten Harry Bosco
and Bull Hurley goes on to the finals.</i>

01:13:52.582 --> 01:13:56.920
<i>Carl Adams. Carl Adams is our winner.
Carl Adams goes on to the finals.</i>

01:14:02.425 --> 01:14:07.263
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready for
the last matches of the semifinal series.</i>

01:14:07.388 --> 01:14:09.557
<i>The winners go on to the finals.</i>

01:14:09.682 --> 01:14:12.018
<i>Over here, we have Mad Dog Madison...</i>

01:14:24.324 --> 01:14:25.825
Come on! Come on!

01:14:30.288 --> 01:14:33.291
Winner, Lincoln Hawk!

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:36.169
<i>Linc Hawk has beaten Mad Dog Madison!</i>

01:14:36.294 --> 01:14:39.756
<i>And Linc Hawk goes on to the finals.</i>

01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:42.551
Next cab. Move it up.

01:14:46.513 --> 01:14:50.267
<i>We're approaching
the most important event</i>

01:14:50.392 --> 01:14:52.811
<i>of this unique and exciting competition.</i>

01:14:52.936 --> 01:14:57.023
The final phase in the world of arm
wrestling. We call this "Over the Top".

01:14:58.358 --> 01:15:01.570
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's bring on our four finalists.</i>

01:15:01.695 --> 01:15:06.783
Our first finalist, from Jacksonville,
Florida, undefeated in five years.

01:15:06.908 --> 01:15:09.202
Let's bring him on. Bull Hurley!

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:31.351
His opponent, two-time Canadian
champion, Slammin' Carl Adams!

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:38.984
From Boston, pride of
the teamsters, Harry Bosco.

01:15:45.157 --> 01:15:50.037
And finally, the newcomer from the
independent truckers, Lincoln Hawk!

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.427
Whoo!

01:16:06.178 --> 01:16:10.893
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give our
four finalists a big round of applause!

01:16:12.645 --> 01:16:16.565
<i>- I can't lose, Hawk.
- Shut up!</i>

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.817
- Say it, man.
- Get your elbows down.

01:16:18.943 --> 01:16:23.030
I can't lose. Come on, let's go.
I can't lose, Hawk.

01:16:23.155 --> 01:16:27.952
Linc Hawk is trying to stay calm,
but inside you know he has to be boiling.

01:16:28.077 --> 01:16:33.999
Look at him, ladies and gentlemen. A lot
of talking to the referee going on, too.

01:16:34.124 --> 01:16:36.752
Dad, over here!

01:16:40.214 --> 01:16:41.841
Dad! Go, Dad!

01:16:41.966 --> 01:16:43.884
- First you, then Hurley.
- Three fouls!

01:16:44.009 --> 01:16:47.888
- I'm psyching up the son of a bitch.
- I'm the ref. Get your elbow in there!

01:16:48.013 --> 01:16:50.224
- Dad!
- Michael, come with me.

01:16:50.349 --> 01:16:55.312
Come here, Michael! Michael,
come here! Stop! Come back.

01:16:55.437 --> 01:16:59.191
Ready? Go!

01:17:02.027 --> 01:17:04.407
<i>...he wears him out.</i>

01:17:04.532 --> 01:17:05.992
<i>OK, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:17:06.117 --> 01:17:09.287
<i>Bull Hurley and Carl Adams
going at it right over there.</i>

01:17:09.412 --> 01:17:10.621
Come on, man!

01:17:14.584 --> 01:17:16.335
Get your shoulders square.

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:22.216
I'm not gonna start until we got it squared.
Lock it back. Ready? Go!

01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:24.594
Winner - Lincoln Hawk!

01:17:27.096 --> 01:17:29.640
- I wasn't ready yet!
- It was fair! You lost!

01:17:29.765 --> 01:17:35.104
Man, I wasn't ready! Hey, I've been
cheated! I wasn't ready, I said!

01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:37.648
Set it off, man!

01:17:41.986 --> 01:17:44.530
- No!
- Yeah!

01:17:44.655 --> 01:17:47.992
<i>Bull Hurley goes on to the
final match of the competition.</i>

01:18:00.423 --> 01:18:03.384
Dad! Dad!

01:18:03.509 --> 01:18:06.846
Mike, what are you doing here? Huh?

01:18:06.971 --> 01:18:09.933
- I had to see you.
- How'd you get here?

01:18:10.058 --> 01:18:15.230
Dad, it's a long story,
but, listen, I want to stay with you.

01:18:16.064 --> 01:18:19.359
- Mike, do you?
- Yeah.

01:18:19.484 --> 01:18:25.406
I want you to stay too, but I don't think
your grandfather is gonna let that happen.

01:18:25.532 --> 01:18:28.701
But I want to be with you, Dad.

01:18:28.826 --> 01:18:34.582
I want to be with you too, but, Mike,
I don't have any money. I sold the truck.

01:18:34.707 --> 01:18:37.710
That's OK. You're going to win
like you said, remember?

01:18:37.835 --> 01:18:41.839
You'll win that big old truck
and you can start your own business.

01:18:45.635 --> 01:18:49.474
Mike, in this last match
I... I think I pulled a little too hard.

01:18:49.599 --> 01:18:52.727
I'm...

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:57.858
And this guy I'm going against, Bull
Hurley, he hasn't lost in about five years,

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:02.279
and... I don't know, he's... he's good, Mike.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:08.201
He's real good and... I just don't know.

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:14.291
Are you saying you're gonna lose?

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.712
I might.

01:19:23.633 --> 01:19:25.927
I don't believe this.

01:19:26.052 --> 01:19:30.015
All that talk about never giving up
was all lies. You never believed it.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.311
And what you said to me, remember?
Now is the time to do it for yourself.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.814
The world meets nobody halfway.
If you want it, you take it.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.066
- Mike.
- You weren't talking about me,

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:42.487
you were talking about yourself.

01:19:42.613 --> 01:19:46.200
- Mike, please.
- Now is your chance, Dad, don't you see?

01:19:46.325 --> 01:19:50.495
I don't care about what happened before,
so stop trying to prove yourself.

01:19:50.621 --> 01:19:56.210
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, Dad.
I don't care about that.

01:19:57.044 --> 01:20:01.465
All I care about is being with you, Dad.

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:06.261
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mike.

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.724
We'll try, OK?

01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:14.478
That's a big guy.

01:20:14.603 --> 01:20:18.524
<i>- Well, so are you.
- Ladies and gentlemen, the final match.</i>

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:29.284
The referees from the International
Arm Wrestling Council.

01:20:33.664 --> 01:20:39.797
The finalist, undefeated in five years,
five-time world champion, Bull Hurley.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.807
And, ladies and gentlemen, the sole
remaining challenger, Lincoln Hawk,

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:53.143
the man who has surprised
everybody here today.

01:20:53.269 --> 01:20:57.022
If you want it, you gotta take it.

01:21:02.152 --> 01:21:04.488
- Challenger and champion.
- You're mine!

01:21:04.613 --> 01:21:09.785
Bull Hurley and Lincoln Hawk.
Or should we say David and Goliath?

01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:13.122
The winner here tonight
will walk out with the world cup,

01:21:13.247 --> 01:21:17.835
a $250,000 truck
from the Volvo White company,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:24.174
$100,000 in cash, and the title
of arm wrestling world champion.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.094
He doesn't belong
on my arm wrestling table.

01:21:27.219 --> 01:21:32.310
That's my area, that's my game.
He's got no shittin' business there.

01:21:32.435 --> 01:21:35.438
<i>Our two finalists are now
psyching each other out.</i>

01:21:35.563 --> 01:21:39.525
<i>Linc Hawk's giving away just
about 100 pounds to Bull Hurley.</i>

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.403
<i>That's a lot to give away in arm wrestling.</i>

01:21:42.528 --> 01:21:44.739
- You're mine.
- Let's go.

01:21:44.864 --> 01:21:48.034
<i>- Yeah!
- Let the competition begin.</i>

01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:49.827
<i>- Yeah!
- May the best man win!</i>

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:55.166
- Come on, chicken shit.
- Place your elbows here. Hawk, you too.

01:21:55.291 --> 01:21:59.503
What I do is, I just try to take my hat
and I turn it around,

01:21:59.629 --> 01:22:02.632
and it's like a switch that goes on.

01:22:02.757 --> 01:22:06.677
<i>And when the switch goes on,
I feel like another person, I feel...</i>

01:22:06.802 --> 01:22:10.890
I don't know, I feel like a...

01:22:11.015 --> 01:22:12.808
like a truck, like a machine.

01:22:12.934 --> 01:22:16.812
I own you. You've been
ducking me for years.

01:22:16.938 --> 01:22:19.690
You've got no chance. You know that?

01:22:19.815 --> 01:22:22.904
- Hawk, back in here now.
- Don't let him psych you, Dad!

01:22:23.029 --> 01:22:26.032
Remember what you told me.
You can do it. I know you can!

01:22:26.157 --> 01:22:29.827
- Get in here! Come on!
- Square up the shoulder.

01:22:29.953 --> 01:22:33.456
You got no power, Hawk.
You got no power.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:36.918
I'm gonna give you
a world of hurt, little man.

01:22:37.043 --> 01:22:41.214
And all I want to do is hurt him,
cripple him, get him off the table,

01:22:41.339 --> 01:22:45.218
and so he never dares
try to compete against me again.

01:22:45.343 --> 01:22:47.762
Ready? Go!

01:22:47.887 --> 01:22:49.097
Get him, Dad!

01:22:51.349 --> 01:22:52.684
Down! Down!

01:22:58.398 --> 01:22:59.607
Way to go!

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.154
Pull it! Pull it, Dad! Over the top!

01:23:05.363 --> 01:23:10.034
- He's letting go.
- No, he's not. No, he's not.

01:23:12.245 --> 01:23:13.705
Go! Go! Get him!

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:15.625
Hawk!

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:19.212
He let go! You asshole!

01:23:23.174 --> 01:23:29.472
You're mine. Can't you understand that?
You're mine, asshole!

01:23:29.598 --> 01:23:32.559
When the two arms come apart,
the strap will be put on.

01:23:32.684 --> 01:23:36.313
- Put your elbows down.
- I'll rip your shittin' arm off, boy.

01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:39.691
I own you!

01:23:39.816 --> 01:23:42.110
<i>Open your thumbs.</i>

01:23:42.819 --> 01:23:46.531
Michael, we're going home
as soon as this is over.

01:23:46.656 --> 01:23:52.454
Dad, come on, you've got to win. Dad,
please. You can do it, I know you can.

01:23:55.874 --> 01:24:00.545
- You can't get away from me now.
- That's two fouls!

01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.672
You all right?

01:24:02.797 --> 01:24:04.883
Your nose hurt, Hawk?

01:24:05.008 --> 01:24:10.182
Dad, come on, take him.
Over the top, Dad! Over the top.

01:24:10.307 --> 01:24:11.850
Come on!

01:24:11.975 --> 01:24:13.101
Ready? Go!

01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:18.524
You ain't shit!

01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:22.736
Oh, what a move by Bull Hurley!
He has Linc Hawk over the line.

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:27.574
Linc Hawk is in trouble.
Hawk is in big trouble.

01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:31.662
He's going down!
I'll break his shittin' arm!

01:24:31.787 --> 01:24:33.580
Come on, Dad!

01:24:33.705 --> 01:24:38.418
<i>He's coming back! He's
coming back! This match is unbelievable.</i>

01:24:42.005 --> 01:24:46.051
You're nothing, I tell you!
You ain't nothing!

01:24:46.176 --> 01:24:48.011
Dad!

01:24:48.136 --> 01:24:50.514
<i>Bull Hurley with a great move!</i>

01:24:50.639 --> 01:24:53.308
Move it. Yes!

01:24:53.433 --> 01:24:55.978
- It looks like Hawk is in big trouble.
- Bull!

01:24:56.103 --> 01:25:00.524
Bull Hurley looks like he's got him.
It looks like Hawk's strength is going.

01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:03.696
<i>I own you!</i>

01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.864
Dad!

01:25:06.991 --> 01:25:08.909
Dad, get him!

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.999
<i>All of a sudden, here we go.
Linc Hawk's making a comeback.</i>

01:25:15.124 --> 01:25:16.542
Yeah! Yeah!

01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:18.919
<i>It looks dead even right now.</i>

01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:23.841
<i>This match has been going on
for over a minute. What a match this is.</i>

01:25:23.966 --> 01:25:27.052
<i>It's all gonna boil down
to who wants it most.</i>

01:25:31.223 --> 01:25:32.516
Dad, yeah.

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:38.230
<i>Maybe Bull Hurley's just too strong.
Maybe he's just too strong.</i>

01:25:38.355 --> 01:25:41.066
It looks like Hawk's
in big trouble right now.

01:25:41.192 --> 01:25:44.069
<i>Bull Hurley looks like he's got him.</i>

01:26:04.091 --> 01:26:05.885
- Go, Bull!
- Get him!

01:26:11.891 --> 01:26:13.893
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:21.400
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:21.526 --> 01:26:23.861
<i>And now it's dead even.</i>

01:26:23.986 --> 01:26:25.238
Yeah!

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:51.224
Winner!

01:26:53.393 --> 01:26:56.563
<i>The new world champion.
Linc Hawk is the new champion!</i>

01:26:56.688 --> 01:26:59.524
<i>Champion of the world,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:27:00.942 --> 01:27:05.905
<i>Incredible! Unbelievable! Unbelievable!</i>

01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:09.617
<i>The world champion has been defeated.</i>

01:27:09.742 --> 01:27:12.871
<i>We have a new world champion:
Linc Hawk!</i>

01:27:12.996 --> 01:27:15.874
<i>A new world champion.
This is unbelievable!</i>

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:22.964
<i>A challenger out of nowhere. Nobody
ever thought he'd have a chance to win.</i>

01:27:23.089 --> 01:27:24.883
<i>We have a new world champion!</i>

01:27:47.824 --> 01:27:50.327
- All right!
- Yeah!

01:28:25.362 --> 01:28:27.822
Why don't we start
our own trucking company?

01:28:27.948 --> 01:28:31.743
We could call it "Son and Hawk".

01:28:31.868 --> 01:28:33.620
- Son and Hawk.
- I like it.

01:28:33.745 --> 01:28:36.166
That's not too bad.

01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:40.504
But how do you think
"Hawk and Son" sounds?

01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:43.632
- Hawk and Son?
- What do you think of that?

01:28:43.757 --> 01:28:46.009
Hawk and Son.

01:28:47.135 --> 01:28:51.223
Hawk and Son.
Hey, I think it just might work.

01:28:51.348 --> 01:28:53.475
Come on.

01:28:57.813 --> 01:29:00.649
Hey, can I drive later, Dad?

01:29:00.774 --> 01:29:03.277
You're an equal partner, aren't you?
