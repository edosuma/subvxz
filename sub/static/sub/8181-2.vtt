DARLING, I GOT BIG NEWS.

02:30.215 --> 02:32.600
DAD, YOU CAN'T TALK

BITES THE DUST.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.441

WHILE I'M DOING THIS.

02:39.508 --> 02:41.526

02:50.802 --> 02:53.505
IT WROTE,
"IT WROTE IT."

02:53.572 --> 02:54.739
YES, IT DID.

02:54.806 --> 02:55.773
IT WROTE,
"YES, IT DID."

02:55.841 --> 02:56.774
OK, EASY NOW.

ALL RIGHT, DAD. IT SAYS
UP HERE ON MY WORK MEMO

03:03.849 --> 03:06.300
THAT YOU HAVE
SOME BIG NEWS.

03:06.368 --> 03:07.718
YES, WE'RE PUTTING ON
A THEATER NIGHT

03:07.786 --> 03:08.753
AT THE SENIOR CENTER,

03:08.820 --> 03:10.321
AND I WAS ABLE
TO PULL SOME STRINGS

03:10.389 --> 03:13.557
AND GET YOU AND DOUGLAS
SOME SEATS RIGHT UP FRONT.

03:13.625 --> 03:17.144
HMM.

03:17.212 --> 03:18.880
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER WENT

03:18.948 --> 03:21.649
TO ANY OF MY PLAYS
WHEN I WAS A KID.

03:21.717 --> 03:22.934
WELL, DARLING,
I WAS A LITTLE BUSY

03:23.001 --> 03:24.001
SUPPORTING YOU.

03:24.070 --> 03:27.588
AND NOW I'M A LITTLE
BUSY SUPPORTING YOU.

03:27.657 --> 03:28.890
SO, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.475
THE DIFFERENCE IS
I HAVE TALENT,

03:30.542 --> 03:33.644
AND SHAME ON YOU
FOR MAKING ME SAY IT.

03:35.247 --> 03:36.514
PROGRAM ON.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.016
ALL EMPLOYEES-

03:38.084 --> 03:39.734
HEY, TONY THREW
IN 6 FREE GARLIC KNOTS.

03:40.536 --> 03:43.904
I ATE 5 IN THE CAR.

03:43.972 --> 03:45.473
I AM STARVING.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.041
WANNA GET
THE PLATES?

03:47.108 --> 03:49.326
PLATES? NO, YOU EAT
RIGHT OUT OF THE TIN.

03:49.394 --> 03:50.327
IT'S BETTER.

03:50.395 --> 03:51.529
YOU KNOW, AND THEN
IN THE HOME STRETCH,

03:51.597 --> 03:53.765
YOU FOLD IT INTO A FUNNEL,
AND YOU DRINK THE SAUCE.

03:53.832 --> 03:56.167
IT'S GOOD.

04:00.572 --> 04:02.506
IS THIS
ALL THE BAGS?

04:02.574 --> 04:04.075
YEAH,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

04:04.109 --> 04:06.377
UM, MY DINNER'S
NOT IN HERE.

04:06.445 --> 04:07.712
WHAT?

04:07.780 --> 04:10.048
YEAH. LOOK, NO EGGPLANT
PARM. NO SALAD.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.016
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

04:12.084 --> 04:14.385
THAT BLOWS.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.269
YEAH, I HAVE
NO DINNER,

04:16.338 --> 04:18.689
AND THAT DOES BLOW,
SO...

04:20.325 --> 04:22.259
YOU WANT
THE LAST GARLIC KNOT?

04:22.327 --> 04:25.246
NO. I WANT YOU
TO GET MY FOOD.

04:25.313 --> 04:27.081
FINE.

04:27.148 --> 04:27.882
OH, I'M SORRY, DOUG.

04:27.949 --> 04:29.767
FORGIVE ME
FOR HAVING TO EAT.

04:29.835 --> 04:31.702
I JUST SAID I WOULD GO.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.405
NO, I KNOW, BUT THIS
IS SO TYPICAL OF YOU.

04:34.473 --> 04:35.607
WHAT?

04:35.675 --> 04:37.592
YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF.

04:37.659 --> 04:39.177
OH, PLEASE.
WHAT ABOUT LAST WEEK?

04:39.245 --> 04:40.278
YOU FORGOT
MY CHEESECAKE

04:40.345 --> 04:41.980
FROM THE
CHEESECAKE FACTORY.

04:42.047 --> 04:43.681
OK? SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A LITTLE BUS RIDE

04:43.749 --> 04:46.434
BACK TO SHUTTYTOWN?

04:46.502 --> 04:50.104
I WOULD, BUT YOU
PROBABLY ATE MY TICKET.

04:50.172 --> 04:52.873
AH, THAT'S-
THAT'S FUNNY,

04:52.941 --> 04:53.874
'CAUSE I EAT
EVERYTHING.

04:53.942 --> 04:54.875
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
RIGHT NOW,

04:54.943 --> 04:55.943
I'M EATING MY DINNER.

04:56.011 --> 04:59.814
YEAH, MMM,
AND IT'S SO GOOD.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.283
MMM. VERY GOOD.

05:02.350 --> 05:03.718
OH, YEAH?
I LOVE IT.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.019
HOW'S IT NOW,
CHUNKY?

05:05.086 --> 05:07.171
HEY, HEY!

05:08.240 --> 05:10.608
PINEY-FRESH, MMM.

05:10.675 --> 05:14.195
MMM, MMM.

05:14.262 --> 05:15.346
AAH!

05:18.751 --> 05:21.753
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.978
HEY, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

05:30.045 --> 05:31.613
PLEASE, NOT
THE FRUIT LOOPS.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.180
NO.

05:33.248 --> 05:35.566
I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.

05:35.634 --> 05:37.568
LOOK AT THIS.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.303
OH, WHAT IS THIS?

05:39.371 --> 05:41.406
WELL,
MY COMPUTER WAS ON,

05:41.474 --> 05:42.640
AND THAT NEW PROGRAM

05:42.708 --> 05:44.743
TRANSCRIBED
OUR ENTIRE FIGHT,

05:44.810 --> 05:46.544
ALL 2 HOURS OF IT.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.012
REALLY?
YEAH.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.465
WHEN DID I SAY,
"BOSOMS"?

05:50.532 --> 05:51.732
NO, NO, NO.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.252
THE FIGHT STARTS HERE,
AND I GOTTA TELL YA,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.054
THERE'S SOME PRETTY
ROUGH STUFF HERE.

05:56.121 --> 05:57.621
HMM. WHERE?

05:57.689 --> 06:00.775
AH, OK, LIKE-
LIKE HERE,

06:00.842 --> 06:04.078
WHERE I SAID, "DIDN'T YOU
NOTICE THE BAG WAS TOO LIGHT?"

06:04.146 --> 06:08.048
AND YOU SAID,
"YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS."

06:08.116 --> 06:10.484
YEAH,
BUT THEN YOU SAID,

06:10.552 --> 06:11.953
"AT LEAST I'M NOT
A MASSIVE FAILURE,"

06:12.021 --> 06:13.888
SO YOU REALLY
ANSWERED THE BELL.

06:13.956 --> 06:14.956
DOUG, COME ON,

06:15.024 --> 06:16.357
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
I MEAN, LOOK.

06:16.424 --> 06:20.377
HERE'S WHERE WE THREATEN TO
RUN EACH OVER WITH OUR CARS.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.013
AND NOW WE'RE HAVING
FRUIT LOOPS TOGETHER.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.447
IT'S A STORYBOOK ENDING.
COME HERE, BABY.

06:23.515 --> 06:24.916
NO, DOUG! COME ON!

06:24.983 --> 06:26.984
COME ON. YOU'RE MAKING A
BIG DEAL OUT OF NOTHING.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.185
IT WAS ONE BAD FIGHT.

06:28.253 --> 06:29.520
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S-

06:29.671 --> 06:32.273
IT'S LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME NOW.

06:32.341 --> 06:34.692
I TELL YOU WHAT, LEAVE THE
COMPUTER ON. LET IT RECORD US.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.328
YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS FIGHT
- IT WAS A FLUKE.

06:37.395 --> 06:39.296
NO, DOUG, IF
THE COMPUTER'S ON,

06:39.364 --> 06:41.833
THEN WE'LL BE ON
OUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.868
CARRIE IS AN ASS!

06:43.936 --> 06:45.586
OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU CAN
SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT,

06:45.654 --> 06:46.854
BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL
AN INCONSIDERATE-

06:46.921 --> 06:48.022
YEAH,
BUT YOU'RE AN ASS!

06:48.089 --> 06:49.089
...SELFISH... YOU'RE
AN ASS! ASS, ASS, ASS!

06:49.158 --> 06:50.625
CARRIE'S AN ASS!
STUPID, STUPID!

06:54.163 --> 06:57.265
OK, ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS GUNFIRE.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.468
I GOTTA TELL YA,
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

07:00.536 --> 07:01.735
ABOUT WHERE
WE'RE HEADED,

07:01.803 --> 07:02.970
AND IF WE DON'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, I MEAN,

07:03.038 --> 07:05.706
MAYBE WE CAN USE SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP.

07:05.774 --> 07:08.409
YOU MEAN-
YOU MEAN LIKE THERAPY?

07:08.477 --> 07:11.112
YEAH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
SAVING OUR MARRIAGE HERE.

07:11.179 --> 07:12.647
I KNOW, IT'S JUST-

07:12.715 --> 07:17.902
I DON'T WANT TO THROW MONEY
DOWN A RATHOLE.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.072
HEY, YOU KNOW OUR
NEW NEIGHBOR GLENN

07:21.140 --> 07:22.407
WHO JUST MOVED
ACROSS THE STREET?

07:22.474 --> 07:24.208
HE'S A MARRIAGE
COUNSELOR.

07:24.276 --> 07:26.844
I'M GOING TO TAKE MARRIAGE ADVICE
FROM A GUY WHO JOGS IN JEANS.

07:26.912 --> 07:28.229
NO, THAT'S
NOT GLENN.

07:28.297 --> 07:29.864
I DON'T GET IT, MAN. I WALK
UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS IN JEANS,

07:29.932 --> 07:30.865
MY LEGS ARE ALL RAW.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.667
OK, LET'S FOCUS,
LET'S FOCUS, OK?

07:33.735 --> 07:35.486
WHAT DO WE DO? DO WE
ASK THIS GUY FOR HELP?

07:35.553 --> 07:37.922
I MEAN, THEN WE
GOTTA PAY HIM THEN.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.224
NO, NO. WE'LL JUST INVITE
HIM OVER FOR, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

07:40.292 --> 07:41.826
"WELCOME TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD" TYPE THING,

07:41.893 --> 07:44.628
AND THEN WE JUST PICK
HIS BRAIN A LITTLE BIT.

07:46.865 --> 07:48.833
OK.
YEAH?

07:48.900 --> 07:49.834
THANK YOU,
HONEY.

07:49.901 --> 07:51.502
RIGHT.

07:51.569 --> 07:52.503
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO FOR DINNER?

07:52.570 --> 07:54.438
UM, YOU WANNA
GET TAKE-OUT?

07:54.506 --> 07:56.540
HMM. THAT'S
A POWDER KEG.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.830
<i>WE'LL BE DOING
A SCENE FROM THE GIN GAME,</i>

08:02.898 --> 08:05.016
AND WHOEVER WINS
THE PART OF FONSIA

08:05.083 --> 08:08.019
SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE MOST
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY GRUELING

08:08.086 --> 08:09.787
8 DAYS OF YOUR LIFE.

08:12.574 --> 08:16.844
NOW, MINNA, HOW MARRIED
ARE YOU TO THE OXYGEN TANK?

08:16.912 --> 08:20.581
WELL, I REALLY
NEED IT TO BREATHE.

08:21.684 --> 08:25.720
LOOKS LIKE WE
HAVE OURSELVES A DIVA.

08:25.788 --> 08:29.907
ARTHUR, WE'VE BEEN STANDING
FOR AN AWFULLY LONG TIME.

08:29.975 --> 08:33.777
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD
TAKE A SEAT FOR A MOMENT?

08:33.845 --> 08:37.181
OH, YOU KNOW
WHERE THEY HAVE SEATS?

08:37.249 --> 08:38.982
AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.183
HIT THE BRICKS!

08:41.970 --> 08:45.039
ARTHUR, YOU KNOW,
I PLAYED FONSIA

08:45.106 --> 08:47.875
AT THE FRESH MEADOWS
COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE.

08:47.976 --> 08:49.994
OH, FRESH MEADOWS.

08:50.062 --> 08:52.663
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BREAK
YOU OF YOUR BAD HABITS!

08:52.731 --> 08:54.248
GET OUT!

08:57.268 --> 09:00.037
NOW, YOU DO UNDERSTAND,
THERE MAY BE SOME TASTEFUL,

09:00.105 --> 09:02.306
BUT FULL-FRONTAL NUDITY.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.431
THAT'S MY FONSIA.

09:18.239 --> 09:20.341
SO, WHEN WE SAW YOUR
GARBAGE CANS KNOCKED OVER,

09:20.409 --> 09:22.393
WE JUST KNEW WE HAD
TO DO SOMETHING.

09:22.461 --> 09:23.694
YEAH, SO I JUST
RUSHED OVER THERE

09:23.762 --> 09:24.511
AND STARTED CLEANING UP
THE TRASH,

09:24.579 --> 09:25.896
AND WHAT POPS OUT
OF ONE OF THE CANS?

09:25.964 --> 09:27.298
A RACCOON.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.166
AND THIS ONE,
TERRIFIED OF RACCOONS.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.468
YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE PEOPLE HANDS,

09:30.535 --> 09:34.555
THEY FREAK ME OUT.
THEY REALLY DO.

09:34.622 --> 09:36.074
WELL, I'M NEW
ON THE BLOCK,

09:36.141 --> 09:38.409
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

09:38.477 --> 09:39.677
OH, THAT'S WHAT
NEIGHBORS ARE FOR,

09:39.744 --> 09:41.862
TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
FOR FREE.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.249
BESIDES, WE WERE
UP ANYWAY HAVING ONE

09:45.317 --> 09:46.750
OF OUR VICIOUS
MARITAL FIGHTS.

09:46.818 --> 09:49.520
OH, YEAH. WE'VE BEEN KNOWN TO
LACE UP THE HEINIE-KICKING BOOTS.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.855
HEH HEH.

09:51.923 --> 09:55.026
OH, YOU KNOW, I HAPPEN TO BE A
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST.

09:55.093 --> 09:55.709
SHUT UP.

09:55.777 --> 09:57.278
NO, REALLY.
IT'S TRUE.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.929
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE,

09:58.997 --> 10:02.049
BUT YOU CERTAINLY DO FILL
OUT A PAIR OF JOGGING JEANS.

10:02.116 --> 10:03.151
IT'S NOT HIM.

10:03.218 --> 10:04.352
LISTEN,

10:04.420 --> 10:06.587
IF YOU EVER NEED A
LITTLE INFORMAL ADVICE,

10:06.654 --> 10:08.089
I'D BE HAPPY TO
HELP YOU OUT-

10:08.156 --> 10:08.889
THAT'D BE GREAT.
JUST READ OVER THIS.

10:08.957 --> 10:10.441
YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE
DONE WITH THAT,

10:10.509 --> 10:12.443
THERE'S MORE OVER THERE.
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME COFFEE ON.

10:23.087 --> 10:25.088
PRETTY BAD, HUH?

10:25.156 --> 10:26.056
UH-HUH.

10:28.877 --> 10:30.611
BUT YOU'VE
SEEN WORSE, RIGHT?

10:30.678 --> 10:33.414
NOT MUCH WORSE, NO.

10:33.481 --> 10:34.882
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
THE THING IS,

10:34.950 --> 10:36.284
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

10:36.351 --> 10:37.584
CAN YOU HELP US?

10:37.652 --> 10:38.902
WHAT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND IS

10:38.970 --> 10:41.405
FIGHTING IS A PART
OF ANY RELATIONSHIP,

10:41.473 --> 10:43.441
BUT YOU MUST DO IT
IN A HEALTHY WAY.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.876
NOW, I'M GONNA GIVE
YOU SOME STRATEGIES

10:45.944 --> 10:47.811
SO YOU CAN CONTAIN
THE CONFLICT,

10:47.879 --> 10:49.347
ERECT
SOME FIREWALLS-

10:49.414 --> 10:51.115
ERECT.

10:52.717 --> 10:54.251
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S A -

10:54.319 --> 10:55.252
OK, SHUT UP, IDIOT.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.253
YOU SHUT UP.

10:56.321 --> 10:57.170
THIS IS GOOD.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.856
LET'S-LET'S
WORK WITH THIS.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.591
DOUG, HOW DID IT
MAKE YOU FEEL

11:00.658 --> 11:02.826
WHEN CARRIE JUST
CALLED YOU AN IDIOT?

11:02.894 --> 11:04.478
MAD.

11:04.546 --> 11:06.747
OH...

11:06.815 --> 11:08.682
AND SAD.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.752
WE CALL WORDS
LIKE THAT "ESCALATORS,"

11:11.820 --> 11:14.621
BECAUSE THEY TAKE THE
CONFLICT TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

11:14.689 --> 11:16.440
OH, LIKE GOING
ON AN ESCALATOR.

11:16.508 --> 11:18.242
VERY GOOD, DOUG.
VERY GOOD.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.844
YEAH.

11:19.911 --> 11:23.281
LEFT UNCHECKED, THESE WORDS
CAN TURN A SIMPLE DISAGREEMENT

11:23.348 --> 11:26.350
INTO A HURTFUL, EVEN
A VIOLENT ENCOUNTER,

11:26.418 --> 11:29.320
LIKE YOU TWO HAD
ABOUT THE KETCHUP

11:29.388 --> 11:32.823
LAST WEDNESDAY
AND THIS MORNING.

11:32.891 --> 11:36.977
SHE KNOWS I DON'T
LIKE THE UPSIDE-DOWN TOP.

11:37.045 --> 11:38.795
OK.

11:38.863 --> 11:40.364
UPSIDE-DOWN JELLY YOU
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH,

11:40.431 --> 11:43.100
BUT KETCHUP,
YOU GO BALLISTIC.

11:43.168 --> 11:44.634
OK, 'CAUSE THE WATER
COLLECTS AT THE TOP,

11:44.702 --> 11:45.736
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

11:45.803 --> 11:49.940
JUST SHOWS
HOW STUPID YOU ARE.

11:56.965 --> 11:59.983
I HAD A LITTLE MONEY,
BUT WITH THE HOSPITAL BILLS

12:00.051 --> 12:02.152
AND TRYING
TO LOOK AFTER MYSELF,

12:02.220 --> 12:05.155
PLUS I STILL HAD THAT
LITTLE HOUSE ON ASH STREET-

12:05.223 --> 12:07.190
STOP! STOP! STOP!
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

12:07.258 --> 12:10.528
OH... WHAT'S WRONG?

12:10.595 --> 12:12.697
YOUR PERFORMANCE.
IT'S ALL SURFACE.

12:12.764 --> 12:14.231
I DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF IT.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.301
YEAH,
WELL, I'M TRYING.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.304
I- I-I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.039
I WANT TRUTH!

12:22.106 --> 12:25.443
FONSIA'S IN PAIN, AND
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THAT.

12:25.510 --> 12:26.343
BUT HOW?

12:26.411 --> 12:28.779
WE NEED
A SENSE MEMORY.

12:28.846 --> 12:30.014
OK.

12:30.081 --> 12:33.150
TELL ME YOUR MOST PAINFUL
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE.

12:33.218 --> 12:34.952
I'D RATHER NOT.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.420
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO DO THE WORK,

12:36.488 --> 12:40.157
I'LL PLAY BOTH PARTS IN A
GENDER-BENDING TOUR DE FORCE!

12:43.161 --> 12:49.100
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT. UM...

12:49.167 --> 12:51.502
IT WAS
MY FIFTH BIRTHDAY,

12:51.570 --> 12:56.039
AND MY MOTHER SAID SHE
WAS HAVING A PARTY FOR ME.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.777
SO I BROUGHT ALL MY
FRIENDS HOME FROM SCHOOL,

13:00.845 --> 13:03.680
BUT WHEN WE WALKED
IN THE DOOR,

13:03.748 --> 13:05.483
THERE WAS MOTHER,

13:05.550 --> 13:10.921
STINKING DRUNK AND
PASSED OUT ON THE COUCH.

13:10.989 --> 13:13.690
THERE WAS NO PARTY,
NO CAKE,

13:13.758 --> 13:17.161
OH, I WANTED TO DIE!

13:17.229 --> 13:23.667
AND I NEVER, NEVER
CELEBRATED MY BIRTHDAY AGAIN.

13:28.639 --> 13:30.807
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

13:39.150 --> 13:40.834
HEY.
HEY.

13:40.902 --> 13:42.252
DID YOU MAKE
YOUR LIST?

13:42.321 --> 13:43.487
WHAT LIST?

13:43.555 --> 13:44.538
OF ESCALATOR WORDS.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.256
GOTCHA!
GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

13:46.324 --> 13:47.792
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GET MINE.

13:47.859 --> 13:49.226
OK.
ALL RIGHT.

13:49.294 --> 13:50.460
LET'S SAVE US
A MARRIAGE.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.829
YEAH.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.699
HEY, WHERE'S GLENN
TO SEE THAT?

13:54.766 --> 13:55.966
OK, YOU MIND
IF I START?

13:56.034 --> 13:56.967
FIRE AWAY.

13:57.035 --> 13:58.368
ALL RIGHT.

13:58.436 --> 13:59.970
NOW, I KNOW IT'S THE
HEAT-OF-THE-MOMENT THING

14:00.038 --> 14:01.338
AND YOU REALLY
DON'T MEAN IT,

14:01.406 --> 14:04.041
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
GET THE BALL ROLLING WITH...

14:04.109 --> 14:05.709
SLUT.

14:05.776 --> 14:07.678
WHAT? I'VE NEVER
CALLED YOU SLUT.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.313
OH, NO?
OK. HERE YOU GO.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.615
I HIGHLIGHTED THEM
FOR YOU.

14:11.683 --> 14:16.119
HERE, HERE, HERE,
HERE, AND HERE.

14:16.187 --> 14:17.605
ACTUALLY, THAT ONE'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SKANK,

14:17.672 --> 14:18.556
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE BOTH GONE.

14:18.623 --> 14:20.474
OK, GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.342
ALL RIGHT.

14:21.409 --> 14:22.459
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

14:22.561 --> 14:24.328
OK, HERE'S
MY FIRST WORD.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.795
FAT.

14:27.316 --> 14:28.482
FAT.

14:28.550 --> 14:30.067
IN ALL ITS FORMS.
FATTY, FAT GUY,

14:30.134 --> 14:31.635
FAT SAJAK.

14:33.071 --> 14:35.972
WOW.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.158
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:37.225 --> 14:38.341
NOTHING. IT'S JUST
THAT YOU'RE REALLY

14:38.409 --> 14:42.279
CHOPPING ME OFF
AT THE KNEES HERE.

14:42.346 --> 14:43.413
YOU KNOW, KEEP FAT,
THAT'S FINE,

14:43.481 --> 14:44.581
'CAUSE I CAN SLIP A SLUT
RIGHT BACK IN A HOLSTER.

14:44.649 --> 14:45.950
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
FINE, FINE. IT'S GONE.

14:46.017 --> 14:47.952
IT'S GONE.

14:48.019 --> 14:49.153
OK, WHAT ELSE
YOU GOT?

14:49.220 --> 14:52.173
ALL RIGHT. DUMB-ASS,
DUMB-AS-ASS, GRANDMA.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.427
PACKAGE DONKEY, ELASTO
PANTS, BEAVER TEETH.

14:56.494 --> 15:00.264
SHE-BEAST, DRACULA,
HITLER JUNIOR.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.933
BLOB, THE BLOB,
BLOB BARKER,

15:03.001 --> 15:06.637
BLOBBA THE HUT,
AND RUB-A-DUB-CHUB.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.256
WHY DON'T WE
JUST EXCHANGE LISTS?

15:09.324 --> 15:11.441
OH, OK.
OK?

15:11.509 --> 15:12.442
I FEEL REALLY GOOD
ABOUT THIS.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.844
ME, TOO.
YEAH.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.114
OH, WOW, I
GOTTA GET GOING.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.582
WHAT?
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

15:18.650 --> 15:19.717
I TOLD THE GUYS I'D WATCH THE MET GAME

15:19.784 --> 15:20.884
WITH THEM
DOWN AT COOPER'S.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.169
I ALREADY
STARTED DINNER.

15:22.237 --> 15:23.520
I LEFT YOU A MESSAGE
ON YOUR CELL PHONE.

15:23.755 --> 15:25.756
AND YOU KNOW I NEVER CHECK
MY CELL PHONE MESSAGES.

15:25.824 --> 15:26.940
WELL, WHOSE FAULT
IS THAT?

15:27.008 --> 15:29.276
DOUG, AGAIN.
ALREADY STARTED DINNER.

15:29.344 --> 15:31.595
WHOA, ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A FIGHT HERE?

15:32.647 --> 15:34.030
YES, I THINK SO.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.483
OK, NOW WHAT DID
GLENN SAY IF WE'RE-

15:35.550 --> 15:37.217
IF WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT,

15:37.285 --> 15:39.653
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE
IT DOWN ON AN INDEX CARD

15:39.721 --> 15:41.121
AND THEN PIN IT
TO THE BOARD.

15:41.189 --> 15:43.006
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND THEN IN 24 HOURS,

15:43.074 --> 15:45.409
IF IT'S STILL A PROBLEM,
WE REVISIT THE ISSUE

15:45.477 --> 15:46.977
FROM A LESS EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED PLACE.

15:47.044 --> 15:48.145
THERE YOU GO.
I GOT THE CARDS.

15:48.212 --> 15:49.230
I'M GONNA
GET THE PIN.

15:49.297 --> 15:50.731
OK.

15:50.798 --> 15:55.653
BLOWING...
OFF... DINNER.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.987
THERE WE GO.

15:57.054 --> 15:58.939
GIMME THE PIN.

15:59.006 --> 16:01.375
PERFECT.
OK.

16:01.443 --> 16:03.310
THERE WE GO.

16:03.378 --> 16:05.079
ALL RIGHT. GOOD FOR US, HUH?

16:05.146 --> 16:06.680
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

16:06.747 --> 16:08.365
I'LL SEE YA.

16:14.522 --> 16:15.923
NO, BETTY,
IT'S NOT YOU.

16:15.990 --> 16:20.544
<i>WE NEED A NEW PLAY. THE GIN
GAME IS JUST NOT CLICKING.</i>

16:20.612 --> 16:24.915
<i>I WAS THINKING WE TRY
THE ELEPHANT MAN.</i>

16:24.982 --> 16:28.519
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WORKING
WITH A SACK OVER YOUR HEAD?

16:30.255 --> 16:32.389
SEE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S SO UPSET ABOUT.

16:32.457 --> 16:33.490
AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

16:33.558 --> 16:34.625
YOUR SYSTEM'S
WORKING GREAT.

16:34.692 --> 16:36.193
YEAH, IT'S WORKING
GREAT FOR YOU

16:36.261 --> 16:37.794
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING
ALL THE BAD STUFF,

16:37.862 --> 16:38.828
YOU IDIOT.

16:38.896 --> 16:41.799
CARRIE.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.584
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT
IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK

16:43.652 --> 16:44.768
AND LOOK
AT ALL OF THESE!

16:44.836 --> 16:46.570
UH, BROKE
CARRIE'S iPOD,

16:46.638 --> 16:47.738
DRUNK AT CARRIE'S
OFFICE PARTY,

16:47.806 --> 16:49.239
LEFT ARTHUR
IN BATHTUB.

16:49.307 --> 16:52.743
THIS ONE JUST SAYS "FIRE." I
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!

16:52.811 --> 16:54.261
HEY, IF SHE'S STILL
MAD ABOUT SOMETHING,

16:54.329 --> 16:56.663
IT'S HER JOB TO BRING IT
UP THE NEXT DAY, NOT MINE.

16:56.731 --> 16:59.483
YES, BUT BY THEN, HE'S
DONE 5 MORE STUPID THINGS.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.118
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.403
OH, YOU'VE DONE PLENTY
OF STUFF YOURSELF.

17:03.471 --> 17:04.521
LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.522
UH, OH,
HERE WE GO.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.223
HERE'S ONE RIGHT
HERE, HUH?

17:07.290 --> 17:09.242
"BOUGHT WRONG FROSTING."

17:09.310 --> 17:10.193
GUILTY!

17:10.261 --> 17:11.511
YEAH. I GOT A GROWN WOMAN ON MY HANDS

17:11.579 --> 17:12.779
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHOCOLATE

17:12.847 --> 17:15.999
AND CHOCOLATE FUDGE!

17:16.067 --> 17:18.018
WELL, IF YOU
HATED IT SO MUCH,

17:18.085 --> 17:19.520
WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO GLENN

17:19.587 --> 17:21.788
HOW YOU CUT YOUR
TONGUE ON THE CAN?!

17:21.856 --> 17:22.957
GUYS, GUYS!

17:23.023 --> 17:23.807
SHE'S NOT
FOLLOWING THE RULES.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.526
OH, STOP
SUCKING UP TO HIM,

17:25.594 --> 17:27.194
YOU FUDGE-EATING
MORON.

17:27.261 --> 17:28.762
OOH.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.864
ESCALATOR WORDS. THOSE
ARE ESCALATOR WORDS.

17:30.932 --> 17:31.698
IS THAT AN
ESCALATOR WORD?

17:31.766 --> 17:34.485
OH, REALLY, OH, I'M SORRY, FAT SAJAK.

17:34.552 --> 17:36.987
YOU FAT, BEAVER-TOOTHED,
PACKAGE DONKEY!

17:37.054 --> 17:40.557
OH, YEAH, WELL, I GOT 2 WORDS FOR YOU:

17:40.625 --> 17:43.227
BO AND TOX!

17:43.295 --> 17:45.195
2.

17:51.803 --> 17:53.304
HELLO.

17:53.371 --> 17:55.139
HI.

17:55.206 --> 17:57.941
COULD YOU GIVE THIS TRANSCRIPT
BACK TO DOUG AND CARRIE?

17:58.009 --> 18:00.877
I DON'T WANT IT
IN MY HOUSE ANYMORE.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.721
OH, WHO'S THERE?

18:11.790 --> 18:12.722
OTHELLO.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.741
AYE, DESDEMONA.

18:14.809 --> 18:18.411
OH, WILL YOU COME
TO MY BED, MY LORD?

18:18.479 --> 18:21.081
HAVE YOU PRAYED
TONIGHT, DESDEMONA?

18:21.149 --> 18:22.316
AYE, MY LORD.

18:22.383 --> 18:24.084
IT IS TOO LATE.

18:24.152 --> 18:25.085
OH.

18:27.255 --> 18:29.573
OH, GREAT. WE'RE LATE.
IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.241
I TOLD YOU TO TAKE
QUEENS BOULEVARD.

18:31.309 --> 18:32.509
I'M A DRIVER, REMEMBER?

18:32.577 --> 18:35.078
YES. I'M REMINDED EVERY
TIME I SEE YOUR PAYCHECK.

18:44.222 --> 18:46.023
A LITTLE HELP.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.358
OH...

18:47.425 --> 18:49.260
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

18:57.201 --> 19:02.539
OK, NEXT UP, WE HAVE ARTHUR
SPOONER AND BETTY HOROWITZ

19:02.607 --> 19:05.742
<i>DOING A SCENE ENTITLED
THE LOVERS...</i>

19:05.810 --> 19:08.579
<i>QUESTION MARK?</i>

19:10.949 --> 19:13.934
TONY THREW IN
6 FREE GARLIC KNOTS.

19:14.002 --> 19:16.937
I ATE 5 IN THE CAR.

19:17.005 --> 19:18.388
IS THAT ALL THE BAGS?

19:18.456 --> 19:20.440
YEAH. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:20.508 --> 19:21.909
WELL, MY DINNER'S
NOT HERE.

19:21.976 --> 19:22.943
WHAT?!

19:23.011 --> 19:25.512
SEE? NO EGGPLANT PARM,
NO SALAD.

19:25.579 --> 19:27.614
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT BLOWS!

19:27.681 --> 19:29.582
YEAH.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.387
DID WE
SEE THIS PLAY?

19:35.690 --> 19:37.458
NO, STUPID, IT'S
NOT A PLAY. IT'S US.

19:37.525 --> 19:38.858
HE MUST HAVE
THE TRANSCRIPTS.

19:38.926 --> 19:41.077
YOU KNOW, IT'D BE NICE

19:41.145 --> 19:46.082
IF YOU GAVE A CRAP ABOUT SOMEONE
BESIDES YOURSELF JUST ONCE!

19:46.150 --> 19:48.318
OH, PLEASE!
HOW ABOUT LAST WEEK?

19:48.386 --> 19:52.022
YOU FORGOT MY CHEESECAKE
FROM THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!

19:52.089 --> 19:55.626
HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE A LITTLE
BUS RIDE BACK TO SHUTTYTOWN?

19:59.030 --> 20:01.465
OK, HE'S GOING RIGHT FROM
HERE TO THE NURSING HOME.

20:01.533 --> 20:05.636
DONE, AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA TAKE
HIM TO DAIRY QUEEN LIKE WE PROMISED.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.905
HEY, DON'T
PUNISH ME.

20:09.757 --> 20:12.475
WELL, HOW DOES IT
TASTE NOW, CHUNKY?

20:12.543 --> 20:16.479
PINEY-FRESH, JUST LIKE
CHRISTMAS DINNER!

20:20.068 --> 20:22.336
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SPRAYED MY FOOD.

20:22.403 --> 20:24.504
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ATE IT.

20:24.572 --> 20:26.790
YOU LIKED IT?
WELL, TRY THIS.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.225
HEY! HEY!

20:28.292 --> 20:29.993
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

20:30.061 --> 20:33.213
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
OH, YEAH! THERE!

20:34.599 --> 20:38.335
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

20:38.403 --> 20:39.669
ME, TOO.

20:39.737 --> 20:41.405
OH, YEAH?

20:41.473 --> 20:44.625
I WISH I HAD A SHOVEL RIGHT
NOW SO I COULD DIG YOUR GRAVE!

20:44.692 --> 20:49.095
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU USE THE
ONE YOU EAT ICE CREAM WITH?

20:49.930 --> 20:52.232
OH, THAT'S CLEVER.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.017
HERE'S A THOUGHT...

20:54.085 --> 20:55.452
PUHHHT!

21:00.692 --> 21:04.295
WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
BUT FEAR ITSELF.

21:07.532 --> 21:11.635
IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES.
IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.006
BOSOMS.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.076
HA!

21:21.305 --> 21:27.832
