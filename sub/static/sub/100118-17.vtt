00:01.784 --> 00:03.568
Previously onDynasty...What do you want me to do?

00:03.612 --> 00:05.527
Pretend that me and Michael
are still together,

00:05.570 --> 00:07.137
that I don't know
you slept with him?

00:07.181 --> 00:09.661
I can't believe I accused you
of flirting with me.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.099
:Oh. I mean, I definitelywas flirting with you.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.448
This is my friend Ramy Crockett.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.667
I know exactly who you
are. You're the thief.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.061
I want my son back.In exchange for your terminating

00:18.105 --> 00:20.107
your daughter's relationship
with Liam,

00:20.150 --> 00:21.456
I'll blockthe sale of C.A.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.154

French toast, anyone?FALLON:Oh.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.874
Is that what that's
supposed to be?

00:48.918 --> 00:50.006
I thought that was
burnt garlic bread.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.007
Toast Français?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.095
Merci, but I don't think

00:52.139 --> 00:53.488
it's supposedto be blackened.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.360
What in the name of Julia Childis going on here?

00:56.404 --> 00:58.406
It's like a war zone.Everybody out.

00:58.449 --> 01:01.104
Somebody had to take
over the cooking duties.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.236
Look, if I had known
that Mrs. Gunnerson

01:02.279 --> 01:03.585
was gonna infect

01:03.628 --> 01:06.283
the entire staff with
typhoid, then Liam and I

01:06.327 --> 01:08.459
would have waitedto move in.It's the flu.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.200
Now, I will take care
of the breakfast

01:10.244 --> 01:12.376
if you'll all just adjourn
to the dining room.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.986
Don't got to tellthis guy twice.BLAKE:
Just help me

01:14.030 --> 01:15.118
figure out this
stupid coffee maker,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
and I'll get out of your hair.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.295
You're gonna break it, sir.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.470
FALLON:
Oh, Cristal.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.602
No need to rush.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.734
There's plenty
of "French toast" left.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.171
I have to run, actually.
I have a meeting

01:24.214 --> 01:25.520
about the fundraising gala
for the clinic.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.826
Oh, the hospital board
approved your proposal?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.393
That's fantastic. If you need me

01:29.437 --> 01:30.786
to call any of my big donors...

01:30.829 --> 01:31.787
I have the foundation's list.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.005
I don't need it mansplained.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.183
I was just trying to help.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.010
I gave you a chance to help,
and you said no.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.059
Wow. I am so sorry...

01:43.103 --> 01:45.148
that I was hereto see that.That?

01:45.192 --> 01:48.282
Oh, that's just marriage.
Cristal and I are fine.

01:48.325 --> 01:51.067
Speaking of which, are
you still going through
with that Liam thing?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.286
That "Liam thing"?

01:52.329 --> 01:54.157
Meaning, getting married
to the man I love?

01:54.201 --> 01:56.159
Yeah. Yeah, we're still
gonna do that.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.248
Just asking. You already
divorced him once.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.076
Well, just trying
to keep up with you.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.995
Eh, I'll skip breakfast.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.390
SAM:You're hovering.No.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.653
Maybe it was your cologne
that drew me in.No.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.437
This is what you dowhen you want something.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.960
You hover. Thank you.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.225
Oh, well, you know, actually,
now that you mention it,

02:18.268 --> 02:20.052
I was wondering if I could
ask, you know, maybe, with

02:20.096 --> 02:21.445
my workload, I was thinkingmaybe I could get an assistant.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.055
You know, it just
would really help

02:23.099 --> 02:24.361
with all the events
we have coming up and...

02:24.405 --> 02:26.276
Sure. Get some résumés.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.105
Wow. Maybe I should have
asked for a raise, too.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.933
Ooh. Is this dark chocolate?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.978
Didn't I just give
you something?

02:33.022 --> 02:35.720
That's a thank you from Ramy
for letting him stay here.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.766
Hmm. Does this mean
he's checking out?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.376
Look, I know you're not a fan,
but the guy

02:39.420 --> 02:40.421
just spent the last 36 months

02:40.464 --> 02:41.726
doing time for me.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.380
No, not the cheese puffs.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.339
No. I was saving those.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
They have sentimental value.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.081
The first thing that Ramy and I

02:49.125 --> 02:50.779
ever stole together
was a bag of those.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.781
Aw, he probably
stole these, too.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.217
Hey.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.654
Ah. And there he is.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.222
Hey, uh, you want to go check
out that new Ethiopian spot?

02:59.266 --> 03:02.182
Sure. Since someone's
already eating my snacks.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.574
Great, I'm starving.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.923
Like I said, get some résumés

03:04.967 --> 03:06.142
and we'll talk
about it later.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.839
And no, not about your raise.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.538
FALLON:
If you think

03:10.581 --> 03:12.104
this is even remotely
acceptable,

03:12.148 --> 03:14.150
you are sorely s...Excuse me? Ms. Carrington?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.718
Allison, you know howI told you never to interrupt me

03:16.761 --> 03:18.110
when I'm in
an important meeting?

03:18.154 --> 03:19.808
Well, that counts
for unimportant ones, too.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.026
ALLISON:I thought you might want

03:21.070 --> 03:23.072
to take a lookat these employee reviews.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.335
Some of the ones about you
are pretty scathing.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.119
Ooh, I'll take them.No, no, no. No.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.599
Give them to me. Come on.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.210
Oh, God. Okay.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.776
Well, you know what they say.

03:31.820 --> 03:34.170
You're not a good boss
unless some people hate you.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.476
And I think you're a great boss.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.479
All right.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.089
Anyway, who decided

03:40.132 --> 03:41.960
I needed to put out
a wedding announcement?

03:42.004 --> 03:43.135
I did.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.833
You can't send out
your save the date

03:44.876 --> 03:46.574
before your announcement.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.141
You have a history
of failed marriages.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.100
The fake one to Jeff,
another fake one to Liam,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.363
and the one to Culhane
that didn't even happen.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.105
I just want to help you
make this one work.

03:56.148 --> 03:59.151
Shouldn't you be helping your
son and nephew-husband recover

03:59.195 --> 04:01.241
from major surgery
instead of bothering me?

04:01.284 --> 04:04.505
Jeff is resting comfortably
at home, thank you for asking,

04:04.548 --> 04:06.420
and Adam is already
up on his feet.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.117
All this dramahas just made me

04:08.160 --> 04:10.641
appreciate life,
and all I want to do

04:10.685 --> 04:13.296
is spend time
with my beloved daughter.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.125
Oh, your daughter whose name
is half the size of yours

04:16.168 --> 04:17.605
on her own wedding announcement?

04:17.648 --> 04:21.130
After 28 hours of laborwith you, I deserve top billing.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.263
Well, I'm amazed my name
is even on the-- Oh! Oh!

04:23.306 --> 04:24.525
Oh, no, no.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.831
I have been waiting for this.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.877
It's a podcast about
fashion and culture,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.096
where people call in
and ask questions.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.098
Sydney Newlove, right there,she has interviewed

04:33.142 --> 04:34.665
every major tastemakeron the planet

04:34.709 --> 04:36.188
over the last three years.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.190
Who's that willowycreature next to her?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.931
That's Gigi Henry,
the fashion designer

04:39.975 --> 04:41.759
I have been
cyberstalking for months,

04:41.803 --> 04:43.239
trying to figure outa way to get her

04:43.283 --> 04:44.675
to design my wedding dress.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.416
But she's impossibleto pin down.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.244
Well, so why don't you just callthis cute little show

04:48.288 --> 04:50.115
and ask her?Huh.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.422
Sounds like you're giving meadvice, which would be a first.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.556
Fortunately, I have alreadygiven myself that same advice.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.993
So, if you don't mind,I need to make a call.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.430
And don't even get me
started on silk.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.171
Worms have feelings, too.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.042
I'm glad you're giving usanother chance,

05:04.086 --> 05:06.306
especially after...

05:06.349 --> 05:08.177
The sex tape with
my stepmother?

05:08.220 --> 05:11.223
Well, if you want to be
that specific, yeah.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.051
Maybe we could just
table that for good?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.233
Speak of the devil.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.757
Maybe if we're quiet,
she'll just go away.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.541
DOMINIQUE:
I can hear you in there.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.630
Too late.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.154
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything scandalous

05:29.198 --> 05:31.026
that should be on camera
for the show.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.767
Well, you're the one who
usually brings the scandal.

05:32.810 --> 05:37.162
Oh, I like that. Maybe I shouldmake it my tagline.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.990
"Dominique brings the scandal."

05:39.034 --> 05:41.210
She also brings
the birthday cake.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.211
Or cupcake.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.560
It's your birthday?Yeah.

05:43.604 --> 05:44.779
Who told you?

05:44.822 --> 05:46.302
The House of Deverauxhas

05:46.346 --> 05:48.783
an exquisitely thorough
research department.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.306
Obviously,

05:50.350 --> 05:51.394
we need to celebrate properly

05:51.438 --> 05:52.395
for the show.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.266
Wait,before you decline,

05:54.310 --> 05:57.052
the new HoDtrailer makes you
look like quite the hero,

05:57.095 --> 05:59.054
saving that little boy
from drowning.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.230
Nothing but flames
in the comments section.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.492
The Internet does love a hero.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.885
Eh, I don't know.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.277
You deserve a party.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.323
What are you gonna do?
Sit around here alone?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.847
I guess that does sound
a little depressing.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.893
Great. Let's talk theme.

06:11.936 --> 06:15.549
I was thinking something sexy,like maybe a pajama party.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.899
And not just because I may bedoing a sleepwear line:

06:17.942 --> 06:19.596
Doma-sleek by Dominique.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.294
If we have the galaat the manor,

06:22.338 --> 06:23.383
then we could savea lot of money.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.385
We just needto dress it up a little.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.647
Oh, I've seen your house

06:26.690 --> 06:27.909
on Lifestyles
of the Insanely Wealthy.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.171
We might have to dress it down.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.564
It's actually pretty homey.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.261
Okay, don't you have
a whole room just for guns?

06:32.304 --> 06:35.133
That's pretty crazy.
Even for Georgia.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.179
No, it's just
functional, really.Mm-hmm.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.963
I'll have to give you a tour.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.705
I'd love that. Get a chance
to see your inner sanctum.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.927
Didn't sound right.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.233
You got a little...

06:51.193 --> 06:53.413
We should really finish this.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.936
Actually, let's do that later.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.764
Um, I forgot
that I have to be somewhere.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.028
I'll see you later.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.427
SYDNEY:
Fallon Carrington
is on the phone.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.080
She's a big fan of yours,
and she has a request.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.648
GIGI: I rarely say this,
but the feeling is not mutual.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.910
Request denied.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.912
So, who's next?What?

07:14.956 --> 07:17.437
What?GIGI:I can't reward abusive behavior.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.350
Even when it's a woman.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.309
Especially when it's a woman.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.267
Haven't you seen
the Internet today?

07:22.311 --> 07:24.705
Horrible bosses
are so last decade.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.794
SYDNEY: That's a good point.
Sorry, Fallon.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.100
When was the last time
we saw each other? Sundance?

07:30.188 --> 07:32.452
Okay. What are
they talking about?

07:32.495 --> 07:33.888
The Internet loves me.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.151
The employee reviews of you
were leaked online.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.458
And not the good one.What-- leaked?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.242
By who? I want that person
fired immediately.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.723
They don't work here. It was...

07:42.766 --> 07:44.333
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.814
No. Gigi just unfollowed me
on Instagram.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.250
And Twitter.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.513
And TikTok.

07:50.557 --> 07:54.299
Okay, what did theseemployee reviews say, anyway?

07:56.214 --> 07:59.740
"Angry and cold"? Wow.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.612
You don't think
I'm angry and cold,

08:02.656 --> 08:03.831
do you, Allison?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.354
Absolutely not.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.529
No, absolutely not.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.400
If anything, I am friendly

08:08.444 --> 08:09.358
and warm.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.186
In fact, I am gonna show Gigi

08:11.229 --> 08:14.363
and the entire worldjust how friendly and warm I am,

08:14.406 --> 08:17.497
and then they will see that all
of my employees are morons.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.368
I don't think Gigi
will take your calls.

08:20.674 --> 08:24.242
But Sydney will.
She's her best friend.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.940
I'm gonna go on that podcast,

08:25.983 --> 08:29.030
I am going to explain that thiswas a huge misunderstanding,

08:29.073 --> 08:30.553
and I'm gonna show Sydney

08:30.597 --> 08:33.556
a softer and gentler side
of Fallon.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.387
And then she will convince Gigito design my wedding dress.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.258
What's taking you so long?

08:40.302 --> 08:41.390
As far as I can tell,

08:41.433 --> 08:42.783
Liam and Fallon
are still just as happy

08:42.826 --> 08:44.480
as a couple of loons in love.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.829
Well, Rome wasn't built
in a day.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.179
No, but it burned down in one.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.008
Doing this quickly
doesn't guarantee

08:51.052 --> 08:52.575
that this breakup
will last forever.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.185
Fortunately,
I don't need forever.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.013
I just need a couple of months

08:56.057 --> 08:58.538
to close a deal
I have pending in Moldavia.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.323
And hopefully at that point,Fallon and Liam will realize

09:01.366 --> 09:03.499
they're better apart,and we can all just move on.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
Moldavia?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.851
I'm on the verge of opening up
their oil market.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.331
Problem is, their king.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.376
He's not exactly a prince.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.596
And I know Liam,and he'll try to stop the deal.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.816
Well, since when has Liam
been involved in the company?

09:15.859 --> 09:17.861
He's not, but he does receive

09:17.905 --> 09:19.863
a large block of shares
when he gets married.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.083
Shares that could make him avery big voice in this company.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.867
But if he doesn't get married...

09:23.911 --> 09:25.608
He gets no shares.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.002
At least until you've finalized
your deal and cashed in.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.525
So, start burning.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.222
Look, it's not gonna
be a problem.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.007
I know Fallon's weakness.

09:33.050 --> 09:36.010
See, you never forget
your first love.

09:36.053 --> 09:39.883
I can use Michael Culhane

09:39.927 --> 09:42.451
to drive a wedge
between Fallon and Liam.

09:42.494 --> 09:43.887
Just don't get cold feet.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.497
Honey, my feet don't get cold.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.762
Fallon can always
find another fiancé,

09:48.805 --> 09:51.373
but there's only one
Carrington Atlantic.

09:51.416 --> 09:54.768
And I will do whatever it takesto get it back.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.665
Hey, it's been nice
hanging out with you today.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.927
Some light father-son bonding.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.190
Well, I figured I might as well

10:26.234 --> 10:28.758
get to know Fallon's
latest fiancé.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.977
Oh, oh, oh.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.979
Hey, I didn't know
you were funny, too.

10:32.022 --> 10:35.809
After a wife or three,
I know marriage isn't easy.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.942
I want the best for my daughterthat can be found.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.644
Well, I may not be
a Jonas Brother,

10:44.687 --> 10:46.297
but I think she's
pretty happy.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.951
Whoa, good putt.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.300
Well, I agree.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.693
She doesn't seem
to be getting bored

10:50.737 --> 10:51.955
like she normally does.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.522
You must be doing
something right.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.958
I think she's developing
less of a taste

10:55.002 --> 10:56.003
for drama
these days.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.657
Fingers crossed.

10:57.700 --> 11:01.182
These last few was
nonstop drama.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.836
Her and Culhane?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.446
On and off like a light switch.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.839
But, you know,they're still close,

11:05.882 --> 11:06.970
so it must haveended okay.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.406
Yeah, we're, uh,

11:08.450 --> 11:10.060
we're going
to his party tomorrow.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.280
Well, that's very
magnanimous of you.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.110
Well, he was very supportive
of Fallon

11:16.153 --> 11:18.025
duringyour amnesia spell.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.201
Eh, like I said, they're close.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.683
I'm glad someone was there
for Fallon when I couldn't be.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.294
But I'm back now.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.688
Forever, this time.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.562
Guess you read it wrong.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.262
I appreciate all of your help,but I just feel like

11:38.306 --> 11:39.916
you can make a biggerimpact somewhere else.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.179
Well, look, I'm not sure
that I agree with that.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.007
Maybe not, but

11:44.051 --> 11:45.835
I think you know
why I'm saying it.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.577
Look, all I know is
that we're two adults

11:48.620 --> 11:49.839
who work well
together.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.058
Hey, hey, hey-- there's my team.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.755
Yourteam?

11:52.799 --> 11:55.018
We are planning
the clinic's fundraising gala.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.585
Planning that
I'm now supervising.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.021
The board assigned me.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.241
Well, tell them to assign
you somewhere else.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.808
You just hadmajor surgery.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.461
Don't you wantto take some time off?

12:03.505 --> 12:06.464
Nah, I have a little less liverthan before, but...

12:06.508 --> 12:08.031
I'm feeling pretty good.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.990
Look, I don't want to be here
any more than you want me

12:10.033 --> 12:13.602
to be here, but the board has
some issues with me.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.647
Understandable.And I want to use

12:15.691 --> 12:17.780
this as an opportunity
to make things right.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.261
So this gala has
to be a success.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.872
So... we all want
the same thing.Actually...

12:22.916 --> 12:25.440
Father Collins was considering
leaving the committee.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.790
Well, now Father Collins
is staying.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.705
The board's very conservative,
and they've made it clear

12:29.749 --> 12:32.882
they want this project to havea community engagement component

12:32.926 --> 12:34.144
as well as a religious one.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.972
And you check
both boxes.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.060
You know, optics.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.454
Should we get
to work?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.238
Welcome to Love, Sydney.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.372
I'm sitting here withentrepreneur, fashion icon,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.200
and current centerof controversy,

12:46.243 --> 12:48.463
Fallon Unlimited CEOFallon Carrington.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.509
Thank you for having me, Sydney,and thank you for allowing me

12:51.553 --> 12:53.729
the chance to clear my name
so that all of your listeners--

12:53.773 --> 12:55.426
and I do mean all
of your listeners--

12:55.470 --> 12:56.863
can see what I'm
really about...

12:56.906 --> 12:57.994
which is kindness.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.256
Well, it wasvery brave of you

12:59.300 --> 13:00.997
to come on afterthe tweetstorm about those...

13:01.041 --> 13:03.217
employee reviews.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.740
How does it feelto have the entire Internet

13:04.784 --> 13:06.742
against you?Well, I'm not
sure I'd say

13:06.786 --> 13:09.614
"entire," but, um, as
you know all too well,

13:09.658 --> 13:12.095
I do feel there's a bit of
chauvinism at play here.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.184
Female bosses are
judged more harshly

13:14.228 --> 13:16.186
than their male counterparts,
even if their behavior

13:16.230 --> 13:17.187
is exactly the same.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.754
Well, I won'tdisagree with that.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.147
And I feel that Gigi--

13:20.190 --> 13:21.191
uh, an amazing fashion designer,

13:21.235 --> 13:22.714
and I really do
love her so much--

13:22.758 --> 13:25.152
I feel she might have
been too quick

13:25.195 --> 13:27.110
to jump into
the patriarchal swimming pool

13:27.154 --> 13:28.372
without hearing my side.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.113
And what is your side?

13:30.157 --> 13:33.116
Nice girls don't make history.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.205
I mean, ever since my
first lemonade stand,

13:35.249 --> 13:37.120
I was criticized
for my attitude,

13:37.164 --> 13:38.426
but I never let it affect me.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.384
Looks like you have

13:40.428 --> 13:42.256
a visitor.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.345
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
that's just my mother.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.433
Your mother?

13:45.476 --> 13:46.913
Oh, she must have some stories.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.828
Maybe you'd liketo come on the show?

13:48.871 --> 13:49.872
She doesn't...I would.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.178
Well,come on over, Mom.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.836
Oh, finally.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.141
You took your timeat brunch.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.360
Ramy didn't have
any nice clothes,

13:59.403 --> 14:00.927
so we stopped at
the mall after.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.493
And then we test-drove
some Porsches.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.278
Please don't tell me you boughthim a Porsche.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.627
Or... stole one.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.150
Relax, I'm just giving him

14:07.194 --> 14:08.456
the billionaire experience.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.892
He's never done
anything like that before.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.633
Well, maybe if he had a job,

14:11.676 --> 14:13.287
he could do that for himself.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.289
Well, good thing I told him
we'd hire him.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.726
"Hire him"?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.075
To do what?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.685
Well, you said
you needed an assistant.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.339
And I realized how much
I miss having him around.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.863
Okay, no.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.039
No, no, absolutely not.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.258
He knows nothingabout hospitality.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.651
Well, neither did
I when I started.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.652
Neither did you.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.175
I'll be stuck training him.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.264
I'm sorry, Sam.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.700
I don't think I can do this.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.398
Well, Kirby,
I'm not really asking.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.314
And please don't make me
choose between you two.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.099
Because unless you're willing
to do some jail time for me,

14:43.143 --> 14:44.622
then you'll probably lose.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.106
And I just said, "Fallon,
you need to stop crying.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.413
"Making a million dollars
on your first lemonade stand--

14:52.456 --> 14:54.415
well, honey, that just
isn't realistic."

14:54.458 --> 14:55.938
Adorable.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.288
And-and fiction, unfortunately.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.160
My mother has always had a,
a flair for the dramatic.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.685
Oh, and speaking
of flare,I noticed

15:03.728 --> 15:06.949
a gorgeous, Gigi-designed
fit-and-flare gown-- hey,

15:06.993 --> 15:08.472
maybe we should
call her...

15:08.516 --> 15:12.041
And I told her, whatever
you want, you go after it.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.782
Any obstacle can
be defeated.

15:13.825 --> 15:14.870
Must have been nice having

15:14.914 --> 15:16.045
a motherwith so much advice.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.394
Yes, yes, um...

15:17.438 --> 15:18.700
whenever I needed her,

15:18.743 --> 15:20.832
she was always somewhere.

15:20.876 --> 15:24.619
Uh, looks like we have someone
calling in for Alexis about

15:24.662 --> 15:26.360
advice for her own
daughter's wardrobe.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.274
Are you up for that?

15:27.317 --> 15:29.015
Of course, well, there's

15:29.058 --> 15:30.320
a reason Fallon is such

15:30.364 --> 15:32.409
a fashion trendsetter, you know.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.021
Hmm.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.414
Just come to the party
and do one shot with me.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.374
Well, since it's your birthday,I'll make an exception.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.289
About the alcohol,
not the pajamas.

15:43.725 --> 15:46.293
I'm also curious as to why
Dominique's so involved.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.077
Oh, Dominique's always involved,but at least this time

15:48.121 --> 15:49.731
it's a means to an end.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.429
But what is that end, hmm?

15:52.473 --> 15:55.128
You planning on becoming
a new reality TV star

15:55.171 --> 15:56.651
like Robin Leach?

15:56.694 --> 15:58.653
I have no idea who that is.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.872
But I'm planning
on using the party to make

16:00.916 --> 16:02.004
a business announcement.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.310
Press release sounds

16:03.353 --> 16:05.007
a lot less treacherous.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.140
Well, press releases come and goand no one notices.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.925
House of Deverauxwill allow me
to reach all the ears

16:09.969 --> 16:12.449
and eyes that I need
without spending a dime.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.410
I just wish I knew where thingsstood with Vanessa.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.282
Everything we do now
is being filmed.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.719
Might I suggest you keep
an eye on that young lady

16:21.763 --> 16:23.417
while the cameras
aren'trolling.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.159
That's the only way you're gonnafind out how she really feels.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.510
Oh, and try not to show up
in any more sex tapes.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.210
What was that about?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.820
That's an odd way
of saying thank you.

16:35.864 --> 16:39.215
Your little sideshow ruinedthe chance for me to get Sydney

16:39.259 --> 16:41.087
and Gigi to see thatI am not a horrible boss.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.524
In fact, we didn't evenget a chance to call her.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.179
Excuse me, but I was only
trying to humanize you.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.528
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.399
Do not pretend
this is about me.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.228
This is about you and how you
love to steal the spotlight.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.056
Just like you did with that
ridiculous announcement

16:54.100 --> 16:55.536
and your marriage
to Jeff.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.277
Feel free to give
your fortune cookie advice

16:57.320 --> 16:59.801
to whoever you want,
but stay out of my way.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.681
I promised you five minutes
and they're almost up.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.075
Oh, Liam, I'm your mother.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.077
Yeah, who lied to me
for over a decade,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.210
about having a son
when I actually had a brother.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.560
And all to protect her pride.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.084
Nevertheless,
you wanted your father's

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
watch and now you have it.Thank you.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.132
Such a shame that
I had to use it to bribe

17:26.175 --> 17:27.872
my own son
to have lunch.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.092
I guess it'd be
a waste of time to ask

17:30.136 --> 17:31.572
how the wedding
planning's going.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.095
Yes, it would be.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.010
Since I meant itwhen I disinvited you.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.099
I know, I know.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.059
I was just wondering
if Fallon had her dress.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.191
I don't think Fallon wants

17:42.235 --> 17:43.845
wedding dressadvice from you.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.325
Uh, she wanted this

17:45.368 --> 17:48.328
uh, Gigi someone to do it,
but they had some sort

17:48.371 --> 17:50.156
of falling out.Gigi Henry?

17:51.896 --> 17:53.420
Knowing her, that sounds right.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.377
What, you know her?

17:54.421 --> 17:56.205
She outfitted me in New York

17:56.249 --> 17:57.554
for, uh, an event.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.165
A "save the whale,"
"kill the whale,"

17:59.208 --> 18:00.992
something about a whale.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.168
Daniel Craig was there.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.386
Yum.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.431
I could introduce Fallon

18:04.474 --> 18:05.736
if you'd like.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.434
To Gigi, not Daniel Craig.

18:09.566 --> 18:13.222
You know what, that would bea really nice surprise for her.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.529
Consider it done.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.099
Though how many wedding dressesdoes one woman need?

18:23.014 --> 18:24.973
Hey, when I was in
the hospital, did you see

18:25.016 --> 18:27.454
Fallon and Culhane
together a lot?

18:27.497 --> 18:28.890
You mean that sweet
drink of tall, dark

18:28.933 --> 18:30.152
and handsome with the abs?

18:30.196 --> 18:32.154
Sure.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.853
He was, uh, dropping Fallon offat the hospital a bunch.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.638
They seemed to be spending
a lot of time together.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.509
But he was her driver.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.515
Who better to sample
the Gala's food

18:45.559 --> 18:47.213
than the planning
committee?

18:47.256 --> 18:49.302
Caviar and crème
fraîche tartlets.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.479
Lobster toasts with avocado
and Espelette pepper.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.959
Escargot with garlic-parsley
butter.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.918
Mmm.
Mmm.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.747
You don't have
to be here if you don't want.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.749
I'd hate for you to be tempted

19:01.792 --> 19:03.403
by all of this decadence.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.405
Well, there are
worse temptations.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.189
Exactly.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.278
Everything in moderation.
Let the man enjoy himself.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.192
Yeah, don't worry about me.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.977
The company's half the fun.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.283
We do make a good team,
don't we?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.285
Yes, yes, some people

19:16.329 --> 19:18.244
just complement each other well.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.465
Thank you.Oh, God, let me do that.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.250
I got to make myself useful.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.950
Thank you.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.436
What's he doing here?

19:36.479 --> 19:39.352
He's on the Gala's
planning committee.Oh, Adam?

19:39.395 --> 19:41.223
That's one way to worm
your way back

19:41.267 --> 19:42.790
into the manor
after you've been banned.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.313
That's not whatthis is about.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.446
But now that I'm here,maybe we should talk.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.492
I think Adam'sintentions are pure.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.494
Who are you?JENNINGS:
This is Caleb.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.061
Father Collins.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.410
He's also helping
plan the event.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.933
No offense, Father,
I know you have

19:55.977 --> 19:57.370
a special relationship with God.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.242
But this is a...
earthly family matter.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.852
Oh, I'm neutral,but I do

20:01.896 --> 20:05.726
applaud your son for trying tomend fences with former enemies.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.336
It's, uh, redemptive and poetic.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.946
It's kind of like"The Prodigal Son."

20:08.990 --> 20:10.470
You know, I never believed that

20:10.513 --> 20:11.732
the Prodigal Son was sorry.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.342
To me, he was just...

20:13.386 --> 20:15.344
trying to get more cash
out of his old man.

20:15.388 --> 20:18.260
Hmm, well, I lean towards mercy.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.522
Well, I lean towards
believing what I see.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.090
And I don't like it, thank you.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.267
Hey, when you're
done eating,

20:25.311 --> 20:26.312
get out.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
I don't want to hear the news
for the next 36 hours.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.882
You got it?

20:31.926 --> 20:33.493
I really wouldn't stressabout the negative press.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.322
The news cycle will change
before you know it.

20:36.365 --> 20:37.975
That podcast was like
a roller coaster

20:38.019 --> 20:40.369
of emotion, if the only
emotion were nausea.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.284
Really? I thought
the show went great.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.460
I didn't know Alexis
was so funny.

20:44.504 --> 20:47.115
And you had amazing chemistry.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.422
I barely got a word in
once she got on the show!

20:49.465 --> 20:51.293
Oh. Maybe that's why.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.425
Listento these tweets.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.730
"Alexis is the mother everyone

20:53.774 --> 20:54.992
wishes they had."

20:55.036 --> 20:56.516
Yep, everyone except me.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.344
And Gigi tweeted,
"Can't wait to spill tea

20:58.387 --> 21:00.128
"and get advice from Alexis

21:00.171 --> 21:01.347
on Love, Sydney."Really?

21:01.390 --> 21:04.350
This is perfect.
If Gigi loves Alexis,

21:04.393 --> 21:06.787
all you have to do
is ask Alexis to ask her

21:06.830 --> 21:08.354
to make the dress.Right.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.312
Thank God you and your mom
are like best friends now.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.313
Do you want meto call her?

21:11.357 --> 21:13.228
No.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.449
I think I may have to go see
my best friend in person.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.668
So, I've-I've never had
an assistant before.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.191
I'll try to be
as clear as possible.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.845
Cool. Hey, how much
am I getting paid?

21:21.889 --> 21:23.325
HR will go over that with you.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.892
And if you're gonnabe here for a while,

21:24.935 --> 21:26.197
I'll need you to focus.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.590
Oh, I'll be here for a while.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.898
And this whole thing seems
pretty straightforward.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.422
Okay, then,
Mr. No Experience.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.685
What should we do
for this 25th birthday party?

21:35.729 --> 21:37.818
Well, since it's
younger-skewing,

21:37.861 --> 21:40.255
I think Sam would like tapas

21:40.299 --> 21:42.344
and tequila.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.259
Interesting choice.Mm-hmm.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.566
But Sam's tastes
have clearly evolved.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.698
It's gonna be more champagne
and charcuterie.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.571
Yeah, look, evolving tastes
or not, I know Sam.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.356
I know Sam. You knewhim.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.141
Bet you a hundred bucks
he likes my idea better.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.579
All right. You're on.

21:59.622 --> 22:00.928
Hey, Sam?Hey.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.669
What should we do
for this party? Do you think

22:02.712 --> 22:04.975
tapas and tequilaor champagne and charcuterie?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.803
Oh, tapas.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.370
Tapas.No question.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.416
Thanks so much.Yeah, hey,

22:10.459 --> 22:12.896
just, uh, go ahead
and hit up my Venmo

22:12.940 --> 22:14.768
with my money.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.903
FALLON:Mommy, Mother,

22:19.947 --> 22:21.905
I have something to say,

22:21.949 --> 22:23.733
and though it's notgoing to be easy...

22:23.777 --> 22:25.735
You don't have to.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.956
You were right.
I stole your spotlight.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.437
But I promise, it will
never happen again.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.830
No, though I might have been
a bit harsh.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.484
No, you don't need me
in your way.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.268
So I'm stepping back.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.314
You have your own spotlight,
and now I have my own.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.272
Oh.

22:44.537 --> 22:45.451
What are you talking about?

22:45.494 --> 22:47.017
Aunt Alexis.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.802
That's what they're
calling me online.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.978
Ever since that podcast,
I've been flooded with e-mails

22:51.021 --> 22:52.806
asking for advice on parenting

22:52.849 --> 22:54.677
and fashion.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.505
Wait, wait, wait.
People are actually asking

22:56.549 --> 22:58.507
for parenting advice from you?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.030
Sydney has even invited me back.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.337
Apparently,
I'm some sort of role model.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.166
That sounds like some sort
of insult to role models.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.907
If you can't be supportive,
then my advice

23:06.950 --> 23:08.430
would be for you to leave.

23:10.606 --> 23:13.348
That's the only good adviceyou've ever had.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.958
You got it.I thought I wasn't gonna

23:15.002 --> 23:16.612
see you until tonight.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.223
Well, I just found somethingout, so I had to come tell you.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.834
Of course, what is it?

23:20.877 --> 23:22.488
Remember those text messages
that you said

23:22.531 --> 23:24.185
went missing
when I was in New York?

23:24.228 --> 23:26.317
Yeah, when I thought
you were ghosting me?

23:26.361 --> 23:29.495
Well, Dominique took my phone,
she deleted the text messages

23:29.538 --> 23:32.411
and she blocked your number
so I'd never find out.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.934
I just overheardtwo House of Deverauxproducers

23:33.977 --> 23:37.024
talking about it.That woman has some issues.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.808
I wasn't even sure
I should tell you,

23:38.852 --> 23:40.549
but with everything
that's happened,

23:40.593 --> 23:42.333
I just wanted to be up-front.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.813
Well, thank you.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.424
It says a lot about you,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.208
and who I can trust.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.950
Anyway, I'm sorry.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.343
And I brought your gift here,
in case you wanted to say,

23:52.387 --> 23:53.954
"Screw Dom and her party"
and have a quiet dinner.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.956
Oh, no.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.827
We having that party.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.441
Hey.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.444
If this is the surprise
that you were talking about,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.968
then I am not
loving it so far.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.012
I mean, how did
she even get in here?

24:09.056 --> 24:10.274
Is it because the staff is sick?

24:10.318 --> 24:11.928
Is she here to convince you
to forgive her?

24:11.972 --> 24:14.757
She helped with the surprise.
Gigi Henry's on her way here.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.064
My mom's getting her
to do your dress.

24:17.107 --> 24:18.761
No, no, no, no. No, thank you.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.764
I mean, i-if I accept help
from your mother, her ghost

24:21.808 --> 24:24.071
will hold it over my head
long after she's dead.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.943
Typical Fallon.Bullheaded as ever.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.945
I thought this woman
was your dream designer.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.904
Yes, yes, she is, but
I can't wear a dress

24:30.947 --> 24:32.122
with so many
strings attached.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.342
Look, it may not bethe way you pictured it,

24:34.385 --> 24:35.909
but, Fallon, I thoughtthis is what you wanted.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.476
Yeah, well, now I want
to change my mind.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.955
LIAM:
Why are you being
so stubborn?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.653
What, you're just cutting offyour nose to prove a point?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.481
My nose is perfectly fine,
thank you.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.960
This is about principle.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.267
I know that's a big word,
but try to sound it out.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.529
I'm really starting
to understand some

24:47.573 --> 24:49.357
of those employee reviews.Excuse me?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.011
LIAM:
I'm sorry, but you
clearly don't care

24:51.054 --> 24:52.491
what other
people think

24:52.534 --> 24:53.927
or have respect for their time.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.494
Well, right now,
you're wasting my time,

24:55.537 --> 24:57.278
so we will finish
this conversation later,

24:57.321 --> 24:59.759
and I will be going
to the party tonight alone.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.283
You're going to Culhane's partyinstead of talking about this?

25:02.326 --> 25:03.937
Aw, and they say
you don't pay attention.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.114
Fallon.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.985
Are you seriousright now?

25:09.029 --> 25:10.987
FALLON: Leave me alone.LIAM: Fallon. Hey!

25:11.031 --> 25:12.554
BLAKE: And you doubted me...LIAM: Come on!

25:12.598 --> 25:16.079
I'm not giving you anything
based on one fight.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.647
We're gonna need more.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.046
♪ I look like this
and I love it ♪

25:26.089 --> 25:28.309
♪ I got you
and you got me, too ♪

25:30.354 --> 25:33.096
♪ And you got me, too...

25:33.140 --> 25:35.490
Everyone, wake up

25:35.534 --> 25:37.666
for our guest of honor,

25:37.710 --> 25:40.016
Michael Culhane!

25:40.060 --> 25:42.018
Hey.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.107
How you doing, buddy?

25:44.151 --> 25:45.108
Jams...

25:45.152 --> 25:46.457
DOMINIQUE:
I hope you like

25:46.501 --> 25:49.112
our pajama party decor.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.505
Well, everything looks great,
so thank you.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.420
You're more than welcome.
Vanessa's going to sing

25:52.463 --> 25:55.205
"Happy Birthday" to you
Marilyn Monroe-style at 9:00.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.555
Then we'll do the cake.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.513
Then I need a scene
of you two canoodling.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.732
That's fine.
I just have to make

25:59.775 --> 26:01.081
an announcement after the cake,

26:01.124 --> 26:02.778
while everyone's still gathered.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.345
It's your night.Do what you want.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.608
I'll just add the bellsand whistles.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.834
Just pretend likewe are not here.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.185
That fight at the housewas just the undercard.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.752
This is the main event.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.581
I still have my doubts you'll
be able to get this done.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.845
Oh, I don't start deals
I can't close.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.456
BARTENDER:
Here you go, bro.

26:28.499 --> 26:31.938
All right. Just one shot
with the B-day boy.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.201
You know, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to, Dad.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.725
This is not even the first shotI've taken today, Kirby.

26:36.769 --> 26:37.987
All right.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.293
Cheers.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.515
Excuse me.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.044
Oh.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.828
How did it gowith Ramy?Fine.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.656
He wasn't particularly
motivated,

26:54.700 --> 26:56.658
but that's no surprise.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.573
He just needs
some time to adjust.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.575
I think the stability
of a job will help.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.750
But he's beengreat, though.

27:01.794 --> 27:02.838
Oh, yeah?I mean,

27:02.882 --> 27:04.013
he's been on
the straight and narrow

27:04.057 --> 27:05.188
ever since he got out.

27:05.232 --> 27:08.104
Was he on the straight
or the narrow

27:08.148 --> 27:10.019
when he stole the
commissioner's watch?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.760
Oh, Culhane told me.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.023
Can you pass the glitter?

27:14.067 --> 27:15.721
He had a slipup.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.157
But you didn't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.637
Well, I didn't say anything
because I knew

27:18.680 --> 27:19.768
you would throw it
back in my face.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.596
Kirby, he's beenthrough a lot

27:21.640 --> 27:22.684
and he needed a second chance,
and you,

27:22.728 --> 27:24.468
of all people,
should understand that.

27:24.512 --> 27:27.167
Now I'm a charity case
like your convict friend?

27:27.210 --> 27:28.821
No, but it's not like you werequalified for this job

27:28.864 --> 27:29.865
when I handed it to you.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.475
Well, if I'm such a problem,

27:31.519 --> 27:32.955
maybe I shouldn't work
at La Mirage anymore.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.435
I'm not stopping you.

27:34.478 --> 27:37.568
Now I'm not sure if I want you
as my boss or my friend.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.570
Okay, Kirby,
now you're just overreacting.

27:39.614 --> 27:40.746
No, you're underreacting,

27:40.789 --> 27:41.877
because you can't see
what's going on.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.272
FALLON: Hey.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.143
I heard you had Andersdoing shots earlier.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.362
That's pretty impressive.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.798
Yeah, he's alreadyback at the manor,

27:49.842 --> 27:52.061
probably asleep.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.629
All these cameras. It's insane.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.848
Are you having
second thoughts?

27:55.891 --> 27:57.284
No, I'm good.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.764
But I heard the Internet
canceled you.

27:58.807 --> 28:02.855
I'm okay, without any help
from anyone, really.

28:02.898 --> 28:05.901
Alexis was supposed to be
helping me, but it turns out,

28:05.945 --> 28:07.468
the only thing stronger
than a mother's love

28:07.511 --> 28:09.078
is Alexis's self-love.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.733
Alexis was gonna help you
treat your employees better?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.082
No, no, not with that.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.867
She was gonna help
with the public's reactions

28:14.910 --> 28:17.696
to the reviews, which is now
costing me a wedding dress.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.568
MICHAEL:
Have you considered that maybe
this might not be happening

28:20.611 --> 28:22.701
if you weren't such a mean boss?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.920
Whoa. Who said anything
about "mean"?

28:24.964 --> 28:27.183
It's not my fault
if my employees can't take it.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.968
I was treated way worse.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.273
You need to stop blaming
mistakes you're making now

28:30.317 --> 28:31.753
on things that happened
years ago.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.060
Go to the people you wronged,make things right.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.324
Okay. Sorry,I didn't realize we were having

28:37.367 --> 28:40.544
real conversation, but, uh,yeah, no, I guess you're right.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.851
I do have a couple people that
I have to make things up to.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.548
Thank you, Culhane.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.767
And happy birthday.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.560
Now, I would like
to thank you all

28:56.604 --> 28:58.737
for coming out to celebrate
my birthday tonight.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.608
My world wouldn't be as special

29:00.651 --> 29:02.001
without all of you in it.ALL: Aw...

29:02.044 --> 29:04.786
Now, I have someexciting news to share.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
Where are those cameras?

29:06.832 --> 29:08.921
I know you have something
important to say,

29:08.964 --> 29:10.313
but as hostof this party,

29:10.357 --> 29:11.837
I have some news of my own.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.664
I'm sure it can wait.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.015
You want me to wait to announce

29:16.058 --> 29:18.539
that Vanessa's song,
"Do Anything,"

29:18.582 --> 29:20.323
just hit the top
ten in downloads?

29:20.367 --> 29:21.716
Should we play itfor everyone?

29:23.152 --> 29:24.545
Don't ruin her moment.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.808
That is a big deal.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.854
And we should celebrate.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.116
Go on and play it.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.860
Okay, you won this one.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.823
♪ Has anybody told you... I'm so sorry.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.217
I know what it's like to have
Dom steal the spotlight.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.914
I'm gonna have a talk with her
about how she treated you.

29:45.958 --> 29:49.352
I appreciate that.
Now go enjoy your moment.

29:49.396 --> 29:53.835
♪ Never stop you or hold you
back if you tried... ♪

29:53.879 --> 29:55.881
LIAM:
What are you doing here,
Fallon?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.970
I told you, you
didn't have to come.Why?

29:58.013 --> 30:00.233
What, so you could have
some alone time with your ex?

30:00.276 --> 30:01.887
Because from whatI have heard and seen,

30:01.930 --> 30:03.758
you've been relying on him
a little too much.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.325
I mean, shouldn't you
be relying on me?

30:05.368 --> 30:07.066
If this is some sort of attempt

30:07.109 --> 30:10.069
to make yourself seem manlier,
it is failing.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.506
He's always had some sort
of special pull over you.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.334
Why does it sound like you thinkI can't take care of myself?

30:14.377 --> 30:16.162
Because I saw that kiss
in the corner.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.860
Kiss? That was nothing.
It's his birthday.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.340
Well, it didn't look
like nothing to me.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.908
Well, if you think that
I have betrayed you so badly,

30:22.951 --> 30:25.171
then why don't we hold off
on the wedding?

30:25.214 --> 30:27.129
So you want to call it off?No, that's not what I said.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.261
Yeah, but that's what you meant.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.306
No, no, no, no.Please do not tell me

30:30.350 --> 30:33.005
what I meant.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.616
Ha! Yes.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.661
Mwah.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.713
Great. Thank you so much.You started without me?

30:45.756 --> 30:48.063
Started and finished.You're late.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.586
Where's Caleb?

30:49.630 --> 30:51.240
He couldn't make it.

30:51.284 --> 30:54.330
There was some emergency witha water main down at the parish.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.724
The man's always getting pulled
in 18 different directions.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.899
All right, well,
I guess that's unavoidable,

30:57.943 --> 30:59.770
but I do want him involved.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.903
And more importantly,
the board wants him involved.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.862
But you can get any priest
to do that.

31:03.905 --> 31:04.906
Why do you want this one?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.342
I like him.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.909
And I want to surround myself

31:07.953 --> 31:10.433
with positive energy
and positive people.

31:10.477 --> 31:13.697
Good for you.But there's no need to CC Caleb

31:13.741 --> 31:15.482
on future planning sessions.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.484
I'm gonna tell him his serviceswon't be needed anymore.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.964
Well, that's not your call
to make, Cristal.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.791
This whole thing is my call.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.793
So fall in line
or move out of the way.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.926
Caleb's busy, so he'll beon the committee in name only.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.580
And if youdon't like that,

31:26.623 --> 31:28.625
we should go to the boardtogether and explain it to them.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.850
All kids do this, no matterwhether they're three or 30.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.766
Just don't discipline him
while you're angry.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.811
Or holding a weapon.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.639
I would not have thought
to add that advice.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.859
Uh, now we have Frankie
on the line.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.687
Frankie, are you there?

31:46.730 --> 31:49.908
FALLON:
Yes, I, uh, have a question
for Aunt Alexis.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.910
It sounds really loud
from where you're calling.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.302
Are you okay, Frankie?

31:53.346 --> 31:55.000
Uh... Uh...

31:55.043 --> 31:57.089
:Yes. I'm just trying to resolve

31:57.132 --> 31:58.960
a few issues from my past.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.703
Okay. Who damaged you
beyond repair?

32:02.746 --> 32:05.271
Hmm? Who do we haveto take down tonight?

32:05.314 --> 32:08.404
Well, there have been a lot
of people who have damaged me,

32:08.448 --> 32:10.754
including my mother, but I, uh,

32:10.798 --> 32:12.060
I'm here to talk
about my colleagues.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.757
A lot of them don't have

32:13.801 --> 32:16.543
as high an opinion
of me as I thought they did.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.805
And this bothers you?

32:17.848 --> 32:19.807
Well, I would never
admit it publicly,

32:19.850 --> 32:22.070
but yes, yes, it does.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.855
You have to process
the criticism.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.901
Uh, you can't grow without it.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.773
I can see
why they feel that way,

32:29.817 --> 32:31.514
but I have to end the cycle.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.953
I want to. I mean, I-I have
to stop blaming my actions

32:34.996 --> 32:37.216
on the bad people and things
that have happened to me,

32:37.259 --> 32:39.740
but... I don't know how.

32:39.783 --> 32:43.004
That's tough,
but you have to realize

32:43.048 --> 32:44.527
you'll never be the perfect boss

32:44.571 --> 32:47.356
or the perfect friend
or daughter.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.532
But guess what? Nobody is.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.231
Believe it or not,
I'm not the perfect mother.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.233
The only thing that I can change

32:54.276 --> 32:56.017
is what happens next.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.847
We've all been hurt. We justdon't want to pass on that hurt.

32:59.890 --> 33:03.024
Does that make sense?Yeah. Shockingly, it does.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.635
So don't worry about
those reviews, sweetheart.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.681
You're a great boss,

33:07.724 --> 33:08.812
an amazing daughter

33:08.856 --> 33:12.468
and I will always be
in your corner.

33:13.730 --> 33:14.818
There you go. Thanks.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.342
Excuse me. Father.Mm-hmm?

33:16.385 --> 33:17.952
Hey. I heard there was anemergency you had to deal with.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.867
Is everything all right
at the parish?

33:19.910 --> 33:22.913
Uh, no, everything's
fine down there.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.915
Who told you that I, uh,
had an emergency?

33:24.959 --> 33:27.135
Cristal. She said that's why
you weren't at the meeting.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.485
Hmm. Well, she told me
that it was canceled.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.140
Probably just
a miscommunication.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.316
You know, I get
a lot of texts, so, um...

33:34.360 --> 33:36.057
I think I just
read hers wrong.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.232
I guess so.Mm-hmm.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.364
All right, well, good night.

33:38.407 --> 33:39.408
Yeah.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.547
Hey. I'd offer to bake yousome cookies,

33:47.590 --> 33:49.157
but I think I know
what the answer would be.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.332
Hmm.

33:50.376 --> 33:51.899
Hey, good news.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.335
Gunnerson's back tomorrow.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.993
Bad news is,
she's still phlegmy.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.564
Maybe if you weren't so selfish,

34:04.607 --> 34:05.913
you'd make
me one, too.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.487
You guys were great tonight.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.837
Really great.
Command performance.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.012
Your mothertotally believed it.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.927
Well, we had enough timeto prepare

34:19.970 --> 34:22.060
thanks to the heads-upyou gave me on the golf outing.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.193
Well, once I kicked the tires
on my new son-in-law,

34:25.237 --> 34:27.717
I figured I could fill you
both in on your mom's plan.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.893
Okay, but tell the truth,
when you first took Liam

34:29.937 --> 34:32.200
to play golf, were you seriouslytrying to break us up?

34:32.244 --> 34:33.941
Oh, no. Of course not.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.076
Okay, maybe a little bit, but...

34:38.119 --> 34:40.121
then I realized I like Liam.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.255
You're lucky I was
able to get Culhane

34:43.298 --> 34:45.039
on board with the charade.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.868
Are you sure you two can keep
this breakup going

34:47.911 --> 34:50.088
long enough for me to get
the paperwork signed for C.A.?

34:50.131 --> 34:52.829
Oh, yeah. Hey, anythingto screw over my mother.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.875
Oh. I'll toast to that.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.579
Britt!

35:05.755 --> 35:07.540
Why is the safe open?
Where's the money?

35:07.583 --> 35:08.802
I don't know.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.499
I'll call the police.No, wait.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.806
Hold on.What?

35:17.027 --> 35:19.769
Uh, you know what? I, uh...

35:19.813 --> 35:22.381
I just remembered, I took
the deposits earlier today.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.949
But I didn't sign...Yeah, but that's
'cause I couldn't find you.

35:25.993 --> 35:26.950
You know what? Forget it.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.169
Don't worry about it.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.779
Okay.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.356
New wedding announcement
fresh from the printer.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.663
New fonts and everything.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.187
Aw. Well, you were right.
The poem is a nice touch.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.234
But we are gonna hold offon sending these out.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.062
It's fine, it's fine, it's justa slight delay, hopefully.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.803
Well, if you need
relationship advice,

35:53.847 --> 35:57.067
Aunt Alexis is here
for you, Frankie.

35:57.111 --> 36:00.201
Right. So, when did
you know it was me?

36:00.245 --> 36:02.290
The moment I heard your voice.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.118
You are my daughter.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.120
And if you want my advice...I don't.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.514
I don't, but apparently,
lots of other people do.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.517
So, what do you say
about Fallon Unlimited

36:11.560 --> 36:15.216
giving Aunt Alexis
her very own podcast?

36:15.260 --> 36:18.045
Ah. I would love
to work with you.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.177
Great. Let's make a deal.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.309
But I have
other offers.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.832
What? From who?

36:22.876 --> 36:24.269
Details aren't important,

36:24.312 --> 36:27.750
but there is a lot
of multi-platform interest.

36:27.794 --> 36:31.406
Okay, I can go
up to twice a month...

36:32.973 --> 36:35.367
...and a written column
in the online magazine

36:35.410 --> 36:38.413
as often as you want.Sold.

36:38.457 --> 36:41.808
And let's get Gigi on my show,
get you your dream dress.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.376
I think the Gigi ship
has sailed, Mom.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.378
But it's fine.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.423
We'll look great
no matter who we wear.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.864
Hey. I see youshowed up early.

36:54.908 --> 36:57.345
Be grateful.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.391
I was on the fence
about coming in at all.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.088
I said a lot of stupid things
last night

37:01.131 --> 37:03.264
that I didn't mean,
and I'm sorry.

37:03.308 --> 37:06.528
You're one of my best friends,
and I'm an idiot.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.444
Why are you being so nice to me?

37:09.488 --> 37:11.316
This is like Jekyll and Hyde
compared to last night.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.405
Ramy took the night deposits

37:13.448 --> 37:15.189
from the safe in my office.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.278
He must have copied the keyswhen he found them.

37:17.322 --> 37:20.673
Right. And so now you want me
to be your friend again?

37:20.716 --> 37:21.978
It's not like that.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.284
Yes, it is.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.459
You turned your back on me
for him.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.635
You didn't even trust me
enough to let me in.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.463
I-I want to keep this job,
but I'm not ready

37:28.507 --> 37:29.725
to be your friend again.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.205
You mean, like, forever?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.555
Let's just keep things
strictly professional for now.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.644
And next time I tell
you you're being used,

37:35.688 --> 37:36.950
maybe you'll listen.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.737
MICHAEL:Well, you did the shot.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.304
You didn't need to bring a gift.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.219
I thought I should
soften the blow.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.482
I told you you'd know
how Vanessa felt

37:47.526 --> 37:49.092
once the cameras were off.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.312
Well, I was watching Dom
trying to sneak away,

37:51.356 --> 37:52.313
and I got suspicious.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.228
So I followed her.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.708
Don't worry,
it's not a sex tape.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.756
And later, you should scold me

38:00.800 --> 38:02.758
in front of Michael
for being selfish.

38:02.802 --> 38:06.196
That way, he stays invested in
you and the House of Deveraux.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.416
It was a good idea to tell him
about the texting.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.244
Or else he might've ditched
the whole party.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.811
DOMINIQUE:I don't mind being the bad guy,

38:11.854 --> 38:13.247
if that's what it takes.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.683
And there were
no cameras around.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.903
They played me for the show.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.426
I'm sorry.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.993
I know how you feel
about Vanessa,

38:20.036 --> 38:22.952
but I thought
you should know.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.261
Allison.

38:28.349 --> 38:29.481
This is gonna be hard to say,

38:29.524 --> 38:30.873
so I'd prefer you not speak.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.353
You're not gonna fire me,
are you?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.486
What? No.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.836
I'm saying I'm sorry. Okay?

38:36.879 --> 38:39.055
I-I reread some
of the reviews,

38:39.099 --> 38:42.668
and it appears I can be
a little insensitive.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.930
Especially to you.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.453
I-Is this a trap?

38:45.497 --> 38:48.021
I'm doing my best
to turn over a new leaf.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.110
Or at least, you know,
half a leaf.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.112
I want you to send
a company-wide e-mail

38:52.155 --> 38:53.374
telling everyone they will be

38:53.418 --> 38:54.636
getting their
bonuses early.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.855
Okay.
And...

38:55.898 --> 38:57.813
Here is a save the date

38:57.857 --> 38:59.424
to my wedding.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.339
Although not everyone's invited,so I'm asking you

39:01.382 --> 39:02.557
to please keep it
on the down-low.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.385
Oh, my God. Really?

39:04.429 --> 39:05.952
Will Gigi be dressing me?

39:05.995 --> 39:07.519
Uh, what color arethe bridesmaids wearing?

39:07.562 --> 39:08.737
Easy, tiger.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.522
I am asking you
to come to the wedding,

39:10.565 --> 39:11.697
not to be in it.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.394
I do have friends,
and I just recently

39:13.438 --> 39:14.917
learned your last name, so...

39:14.961 --> 39:16.571
But I've worked for you
for over a year.

39:17.616 --> 39:19.269
Yes, you have.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.882
Okay, that's good for today.

39:25.014 --> 39:28.757
CALEB:Hey, did you make up some storyabout me to tell Adam?

39:28.801 --> 39:32.631
I had to explain why
I wanted you off this project.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.936
And why do you?

39:33.980 --> 39:35.242
You know why.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.550
I am feeling guilty enough.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.204
Stop pretending there's not
this thing between us.

39:41.248 --> 39:42.989
What thing?

39:44.643 --> 39:47.297
You're a beautiful woman,
obviously,

39:47.341 --> 39:48.864
but I thought
that we were just...

39:50.083 --> 39:51.693
...working together.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.655
So when you touched
my hand at the manor,

39:56.698 --> 39:58.483
that meant nothing?

39:58.526 --> 40:00.876
Or when you brushed my hair
away from my face

40:00.920 --> 40:03.009
or told me you
were flirting,

40:03.052 --> 40:04.619
there was nothing
behind any of that?

40:04.663 --> 40:06.621
Okay.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.798
I guess there's no point addinga lie to my list of sins.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.844
Um, yes.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.411
I do...

40:13.454 --> 40:15.021
have feelings for you, Cristal.

40:16.718 --> 40:20.983
Tempting a man of God wasn't
exactly in my redemption plan.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.333
And being tempted
wasn't in mine.

40:23.377 --> 40:26.293
Well, what do we do now?

40:28.251 --> 40:29.470
This.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.002
LAURA:
To that Carrington cunning

40:40.046 --> 40:43.615
I have heard so much about.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.878
I did say I'd do anything
to get my company back.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.619
Yes, you did.

40:47.662 --> 40:48.620
And I have good news.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.448
I can hardly wait.

40:50.491 --> 40:53.015
I'm going to fire Carrington
Atlantic's CEO Dustin

40:53.059 --> 40:54.669
in the morning.

40:54.713 --> 40:57.890
So, the Colbys' blackmail plot
against him won't matter.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.587
And the path will be clearfor you to own C.A. again.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.023
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.547
What happened
to your Moldavian deal?

41:02.590 --> 41:04.157
I thought that was supposed
to take at least a month.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.376
I applied some pressure
and closed it early.

41:06.420 --> 41:10.511
So, I broke up Fallon and Liam
for nothing?

41:10.555 --> 41:13.819
Well, I didn't know for sure
this plan would work.

41:13.862 --> 41:17.518
But that should bea pleasant surprise for us all.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.565
You knew exactly what to put onthe table to get what you want.

41:20.608 --> 41:23.568
It's all part
of the game, right?

41:23.611 --> 41:25.004
I do appreciate a woman

41:25.047 --> 41:26.832
who knows how
to get her hands dirty.

41:26.875 --> 41:31.706
And I appreciate that you
can be so ruthless

41:31.750 --> 41:33.578
without getting
emotionally attached.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.582
Wow, look at us.

41:37.625 --> 41:40.759
We haven't even started
massaging the numbers yet.
