Ahh!

00:37.270 --> 00:38.505
Aah! Hey!

00:40.740 --> 00:42.276
- Huh?

00:42.308 --> 00:44.343
- Huh.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.579
Whoa!

00:45.612 --> 00:47.548
This bill from the power company,

00:47.581 --> 00:49.615
they say I haven't paid it, but I did!

00:49.649 --> 00:52.453
They're charging a $3 late fee!

00:52.485 --> 00:53.853
Please, will you call them?

00:53.887 --> 00:57.390
No. I've got a lot going on today.
Handle it.

00:57.423 --> 00:59.460
Fine! Huh! Hmm.

01:00.659 --> 01:03.262
Mom, you look funny!

01:03.296 --> 01:05.132
I'm doing aerobics, Tommy.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.365
Oh! Down, boy.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.468
Can I do "aerob-tics" with you?

01:08.501 --> 01:10.970
Uh, no. Go find a friend to play with.

01:11.004 --> 01:14.308
Hmm. Where, oh,
where can I find a friend?

01:14.340 --> 01:15.575
A friend!

01:15.608 --> 01:17.210
Friend, friend, friend!

01:17.243 --> 01:20.046
Where can I find a friend?

01:21.013 --> 01:22.949
Hey, quit hogging the ball.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.084
I want to put it in!

01:24.117 --> 01:26.286
Not before I shoot it
all over your face!

01:26.319 --> 01:28.822
Hi! Can I play with you guys?

01:28.855 --> 01:30.757
No. You have leg braces.

01:30.790 --> 01:31.792
Huh?

01:31.825 --> 01:33.460
Yeah, loser!

01:33.492 --> 01:35.328
Oh! Aah!

01:35.361 --> 01:36.562
Aaaah!

01:36.596 --> 01:38.564
Aw, no!

01:38.597 --> 01:40.667
My leg braces "breaked."

01:41.085 --> 01:44.070
Identify yourself!

01:44.103 --> 01:46.507
Huh? Who said that?

01:47.301 --> 01:49.343
I repeat, identify yourself.

01:49.742 --> 01:50.978
I'm Tommy.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.912
Target identified.

01:52.945 --> 01:53.914
Who are you?!

01:53.947 --> 01:55.582
I am S.H.O.E.S., which stands for

01:55.614 --> 01:58.317
Secret Hyper Operational
Exoskeleton System.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.420
What does "Tommy" stand for?

02:00.453 --> 02:02.256
Nothing. I can't stand.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.590
Whoa!

02:03.623 --> 02:06.026
See, I was looking for a friend but...

02:06.058 --> 02:08.693
What is "friend"?

02:08.728 --> 02:12.533
Oh. A friend is somebody
you do things with.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.435
Could I be friend?

02:15.467 --> 02:17.637
Whee!

02:17.670 --> 02:20.473
Whoa! That's so fast!

02:20.507 --> 02:22.709
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:22.741 --> 02:24.644
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ha!

02:24.677 --> 02:25.811
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

02:25.844 --> 02:27.713
You ain't seen nothing yet!

02:27.747 --> 02:33.020
Ha! Who-o-o-o-o-o-a!

02:33.052 --> 02:34.054
Ow!

02:35.155 --> 02:35.989
You suck!

02:36.021 --> 02:37.223
But those shoes are awesome!

02:37.257 --> 02:38.391
- Huh?
- Grab him!

02:38.425 --> 02:39.993
Yeah, let's tug 'em off!

02:40.026 --> 02:41.395
Aah! No!

02:41.427 --> 02:42.728
Target identified!

02:42.762 --> 02:43.729
Cool!

02:43.763 --> 02:44.865
Destroy target.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.400
No! Come on, S.H.O.E.S.

02:46.432 --> 02:47.633
Let's get out of here.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.368
Affirmative. Getting out of here.

02:49.401 --> 02:50.536
Whoa!

02:50.569 --> 02:51.737
Hey! Come back with those shoes!

02:51.770 --> 02:54.591
Sir, I've got eyes on S.H.O.E.S.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.978
No, I am not paying a $3 late fee.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.343
Dad, meet my friend S.H.O.E.S.

03:00.475 --> 03:04.016
Well, I'd like to see you try
and take $3 from me, buddy.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.686
Hand it over!

03:05.718 --> 03:07.587
What? No. You'll never get it from me.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.323
Oh, I see.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.158
Well, I better go get my gun,
and we'll settle this like men.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.260
Tommy, they found me. It's over.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.097
Listen, kid. S.H.O.E.S. was
designed for the military,

03:17.129 --> 03:19.765
but some pairs began
developing a mind of their own

03:19.799 --> 03:21.401
and learned how to tie their own laces.

03:21.433 --> 03:24.437
We need to destroy S.H.O.E.S.
before someone gets hurt!

03:24.471 --> 03:26.173
But he's my friend!

03:26.205 --> 03:28.841
No! He's a cold-blooded killing machine!

03:28.875 --> 03:30.743
Yep. He's evil all right.

03:30.776 --> 03:32.411
- Huh?
- Oh, no! They got away!

03:32.444 --> 03:33.680
What? No! Damn it!

03:33.712 --> 03:35.448
He has an underground
lair with prisoners

03:35.481 --> 03:37.010
and a river of blood.

03:37.155 --> 03:39.886
Hmm. This is worse than we thought.
Move out.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.588
We're gonna have to get more creative

03:41.621 --> 03:42.789
to get him away from the kid.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.358
What's all this commotion?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.025
Looks like I'm not the only one

03:46.058 --> 03:48.021
that knows Mr. Pickles is evil.

03:48.126 --> 03:49.263
Ugh. Never mind.

03:49.295 --> 03:53.466
Now, I got two BBs that says
you won't take $3 from me!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.468
You cowards! Get out of here!

03:55.502 --> 03:57.204
Whoa!

03:57.236 --> 03:59.472
S.H.O.E.S.,
we need to find a safe place.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.141
- Okay. In here.
- Huh?

04:02.175 --> 04:04.478
Aah! Tommy, I'm in the bath!

04:04.510 --> 04:06.280
Aaaaaaaah!

04:07.813 --> 04:11.150
- Hold on, Tommy.
- Oh! Whoa!

04:11.183 --> 04:13.486
Ooh, ooh! Oh! Not now, Tommy!

04:13.520 --> 04:14.655
I'm in the middle of something!

04:14.687 --> 04:17.257
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

04:18.824 --> 04:21.894
Oh! Here's A Safe Place.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.663
- Huh?
- Hi.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.831
- Cut!
- Huh?

04:24.863 --> 04:26.666
What are you doing on set?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.301
Are we safe?

04:28.334 --> 04:29.871
Say that again.

04:29.977 --> 04:31.404
Are we safe?

04:31.613 --> 04:33.339
You're Safe all right!

04:33.372 --> 04:38.644
The role of Johnny Safe will
now be played by these shoes.

04:38.677 --> 04:39.680
What?!

04:39.713 --> 04:41.515
Uh-huh!

05:12.911 --> 05:15.715
Hey, Dad, can I borrow the car tonight?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.185
I have a date with Denise DeCarlo.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.653
She is one hot babe.

05:19.685 --> 05:20.986
Va-va-va-va-voom!

05:21.019 --> 05:23.322
Hold it, lover boy.

05:23.355 --> 05:24.658
Did you make the team?

05:24.690 --> 05:27.083
- Uh...
- He made the team all right...

05:27.228 --> 05:28.728
the chess team.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.062
Chess?

05:30.096 --> 05:32.899
You want the car,
make the baseball team.

05:32.965 --> 05:37.793
Maybe then you'll get to first
base with Denise DeCarlo.

05:38.149 --> 05:40.006
But I don't like baseball.

05:40.038 --> 05:41.640
Well, as long as you're in my house,

05:41.673 --> 05:44.577
you live by my rules, or you're...

05:44.610 --> 05:46.980
Outta here!

05:47.012 --> 05:50.483
Aw,
I wish you died in the fire and not Mom.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.753
- Cut!
- Huh?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.521
Oh! Go away, boy.

05:54.553 --> 05:56.222
I'm acting with my friend!

05:58.458 --> 05:59.926
Great work, S.H.O.E.S.!

05:59.959 --> 06:02.596
The network wants to make you the star.

06:02.864 --> 06:03.730
Star?

06:03.762 --> 06:05.364
Yeah, but one thing...

06:05.398 --> 06:06.600
you got to ditch the kid.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.033
Uh... S.H.O.E.S.?

06:08.067 --> 06:09.903
Sorry, Tommy. You're dragging me down.

06:09.935 --> 06:13.239
Detaching. I'm going to be a star!

06:13.273 --> 06:14.408
Ha! Wha...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.742
We've got S.H.O.E.S.!
Move out, move out!

06:16.776 --> 06:17.877
Let's get...

06:17.911 --> 06:19.278
Outta here!

06:20.779 --> 06:22.715
Stupid kid!

06:22.749 --> 06:24.384
Wait! No! Aah!

S.H.O.E.S.!

06:28.420 --> 06:30.757
Hey, look! It's that stupid kid's dog!

06:30.790 --> 06:32.225
Loser!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.461
S.H.O.E.S.!

06:35.495 --> 06:37.297
Where are you, S.H.O.E.S.?

06:37.329 --> 06:39.699
Aah! Oh, no!

06:39.732 --> 06:41.935
Aaaaaaaah!

06:57.684 --> 06:59.886
- Ha!
- Don't dismantle me!

07:01.954 --> 07:03.322
All personnel to the stock room.

07:03.355 --> 07:05.826
We've got a new shipment of S.H.O.E.S.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.060
S.H.O.E.S.?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.295
- Tommy?
- What did they do to you?!

07:09.329 --> 07:11.331
I didn't expect to see you again,

07:11.363 --> 07:13.899
not after I was such a bad friend.

07:13.932 --> 07:16.836
But friends never give up on each other.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.504
- Oh.
- So you and your friend

07:18.538 --> 07:21.174
thought you could outsmart us,
huh, S.H.O.E.S.?

07:21.206 --> 07:22.843
- Whoa!
- Well, I'm gonna cut off

07:22.875 --> 07:25.611
your tongue and rip out your soul!

07:25.644 --> 07:27.680
No! Aaah!

07:27.713 --> 07:29.315
No! Stop killing S.H.O.E.S.!

07:29.348 --> 07:31.985
Fine! I'll let them do it.

07:32.017 --> 07:33.919
- Huh?
- Meet New S.H.O.E.S.!

07:33.952 --> 07:36.689
- New S.H.O.E.S.!
- Now with orthopedic inserts,

07:36.723 --> 07:38.324
and they can fly!

07:38.358 --> 07:40.694
Target identified!

07:40.726 --> 07:43.195
Mr. Pickles!

07:50.956 --> 07:53.873
Normally, he comes when I call,
but

07:53.906 --> 07:56.842
I ignored him, and now he's not coming.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.448
Hey! No dogs allow-Ow!

08:01.480 --> 08:03.382
Aah! Hey!

08:03.415 --> 08:05.533
Get that dog!

08:06.552 --> 08:08.555
Aah!

08:17.197 --> 08:18.564
Yay! Mr. Pickles!

08:18.598 --> 08:19.900
- Huh?
- Help!

08:19.932 --> 08:21.834
Those S.H.O.E.S. are
gonna kill S.H.O.E.S.!

08:21.867 --> 08:23.536
Target identified.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.572
Destroy target.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.240
Ouch! Aah!

08:27.273 --> 08:29.342
Ow!

08:29.375 --> 08:30.410
Destroy!

08:30.442 --> 08:31.644
Aah!

08:31.677 --> 08:32.745
Get him!

08:32.778 --> 08:34.179
Affirmative.

08:34.212 --> 08:35.554
Hey!

08:37.283 --> 08:38.510
Whoa!

08:42.270 --> 08:43.355
Finish him!

08:43.389 --> 08:46.659
Mr. Pickles,
even though you aren't much of a hero,

08:46.692 --> 08:50.864
I want you to know that
you're my best friend.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.067
I thought I was your friend.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.268
You are, S.H.O.E.S.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.403
You can have more than one friend.

08:57.628 --> 08:59.371
So we can all be friends?

08:59.404 --> 09:01.875
- Hi. I am S.H.O.E.S.
- I am S.H.O.E.S., too.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.043
- Nice to meet you.
- S.H.O.E.S. here.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.611
- Hi. My name is Bill.
- Aw, kid!

09:05.644 --> 09:07.346
You ruined everything!

09:07.379 --> 09:09.601
Die!

09:11.551 --> 09:13.787
Nooooooo!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.057
S.H.O.E.S.!

09:17.090 --> 09:21.027
Goodbye, friend.

09:21.059 --> 09:22.561
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:22.595 --> 09:23.964
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:23.996 --> 09:26.699
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:26.732 --> 09:28.934
Whoa!

09:28.967 --> 09:32.204
Whee!

09:32.238 --> 09:34.474
Hey, look down there!

09:34.506 --> 09:36.475
Hi, Bigfoot!

09:38.010 --> 09:39.712
Whee!

09:39.745 --> 09:40.813
Huh?

09:40.846 --> 09:42.481
Whee!

09:42.514 --> 09:43.616
- Run!
- Run!

09:44.594 --> 09:45.985
Get 'em!

09:55.777 --> 09:57.330
Yeah!

09:57.363 --> 10:01.501
"And so they went
on to many other adventures

10:01.533 --> 10:04.336
and explored many other
things with each other,

10:04.370 --> 10:07.006
but that is a different story.

10:07.665 --> 10:09.642
The end."

10:09.676 --> 10:11.177
What are you doing now?

10:11.210 --> 10:13.312
Writing a romance novel.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.615
Did you take care of the power bill,
Stanley?

10:16.649 --> 10:18.317
I handled it, woman.

10:18.350 --> 10:19.785
So manly.

10:19.818 --> 10:20.986
- Come to bed.
- What?

10:21.019 --> 10:23.523
I want to work out an idea with you.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.359
Oh, mama! It's been a while!

10:26.392 --> 10:27.694
Ho-ho!

10:27.726 --> 10:28.927
Ew! Huh?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.529
You said he had an underground lair.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.197
Huh? Can you show me where it is?

10:33.217 --> 10:34.033
Stanley!

10:34.067 --> 10:36.201
Aw! Heck!

10:36.235 --> 10:39.773
The underground lair is in here,
but be careful of the...

10:39.806 --> 10:41.206
Huh?! "Mr. Pickles"?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.143
Yeah, the evil dog.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.445
Evil dog?! What, are you crazy?!

10:45.477 --> 10:48.088
I'm talking about evil shoes!

10:48.273 --> 10:51.283
Huh? Aah!

10:51.317 --> 10:52.286
Eh.
