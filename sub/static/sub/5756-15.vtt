WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:05.021
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS..

00:05.070 --> 00:07.334
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

00:07.370 --> 00:09.065
NOT "WHAT." "WHO."

00:09.110 --> 00:10.463
THAT NEW KID?

00:10.510 --> 00:13.070
I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
I HEARD HE'S SKETCHY.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.099
OH, UH,

00:14.140 --> 00:15.334
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO FIRST,

00:15.380 --> 00:17.143
AND I'LL COUNT TO FIFI'Y.

00:17.180 --> 00:17.976
OKAY.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.239
Aria:
I BARELY REMEMBER JASON.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.484
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM,
HE WAS JUST

00:23.520 --> 00:25.511
ALI'S OLDER BROTHER
DOWN THE HALL.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.484
Hanna:
THAT'S ALISON'S BRACELET.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.181
Spencer:
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE
WE FOUND IN THE WOODS?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.585
SOMEONE MADE A COPY
OF ALISON'S BRACELET.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.451
Hanna: WELL, IF THE BANK
FINDS OUT ABOUT YOUR
UNAUTHORIZED LOAN,

00:34.500 --> 00:37.526
THAT'S LIKE A FELONY, RIGHT?
IT'S ONLY A FELONY
IF THEY FIND OUT.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.265
HEY, WAS THAT MAYA?

00:40.500 --> 00:42.468
HOW IS SHE?
IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.331
I'M NOT SENSING
"GOOD" HERE, EMILY.
MAYBE SHE'S MOVED ON.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.398
FIND A BETTER PLACE
TO HIDE IT.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.146
THERE'S A SHADOW RIGHT THERE,

00:50.180 --> 00:51.204
LIKE SOMEONE WAS
FOLLOWING HER.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.138
SPENCE, DO YOU KNOW
WHO THAT IS?

00:53.180 --> 00:56.286
UH...I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.410
WAIT. WHERE'S IAN?

00:59.460 --> 01:02.156
DON'T WORRY,
HE WENT TO PHILLY
TO BE WITH MELISSA.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.158
I DIDN'T REALIZE
LIFE EXISTED AT
THIS HOUR.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.852
COME ON, GUYS, JUST WALK.
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.596
I ALWAYS HOPED MY FIRST SUNRISE
WOULD HAVE TEQUILA IN IT.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.427
I'LL MAKE COFFEE.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.439
WELL, WHEN IT'S READY
JUST POUR IT DOWN MY THROAT.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.459
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE
LOOKING AT THIS.

01:18.510 --> 01:21.877
I MEAN, WE KNOW
THE SHADOW IS IAN,
RIGHT?

01:21.910 --> 01:23.468
YOU WOKE US UP FOR THIS?

01:23.510 --> 01:24.579
IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:24.610 --> 01:27.545
I COULDN'T LET IT GO.

01:27.580 --> 01:29.138
HAVE YOU BEEN UP ALL NIGHT?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.817
MAYBE.
YOU HAVE.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.317
ONE EYE IS BIGGER
THAN THE OTHER.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.351
YOU LOOK LIKE A STRUNG OUT
POWER PUFF GIRL.

01:34.390 --> 01:36.221
STOP LOOKING AT THE EYE.
JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURE.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.557
WHO'S HAVING COFFEE?

01:37.590 --> 01:40.559
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
WHERE THIS PICTURE

01:40.600 --> 01:42.625
COULD HAVE BEEN
TAKEN FROM.
WHERE?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.467
ALISON'S BEDROOM.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.492
NO, ALISON IS IN THE PICTURE.
SHE CLEARLY DIDN'T TAKE THAT.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.134
OKAY, BUT SOMEBODY
IN HER HOUSE DID.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.535
LIKE WHO,
HER PARENTS?

01:51.570 --> 01:53.504
NO. HER BROTHER.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.269
JASON.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.403
YOU KNOW, MY MOM
RAN INTO HIM AT THE BANK.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.509
HE'S BACK IN TOWN.
WHY?

01:59.550 --> 02:00.710
WE HAVE TO CALL HIM.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.638
EWW. I AM NOT GOING
TO TALK TO HIM.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.112
ME EITHER.
I WILL.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.514
WE NEED TO KNOW
IF HE TOOK THIS.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.860
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

02:16.900 --> 02:19.460
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

02:19.500 --> 02:21.889
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:21.940 --> 02:24.534
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:24.570 --> 02:26.538
* IF I SHOW YOU
THEN I KNOW YOU *

02:26.580 --> 02:29.606
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:29.650 --> 02:32.210
* 'CAUSE TWO
CAN KEEP A SECRET *

02:32.250 --> 02:34.571
* IF ONE OF THEM
IS DEAD *

02:45.530 --> 02:48.693
OKAY, CAN YOU
MOVE THAT MEETING UP?

02:48.730 --> 02:50.823
I'LL NEED TO BE
ON THE ROAD BY FOUR.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.628
OKAY, GREAT.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.558
LET'S GO OVER THE SCHEDULE
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.804
Would you pass me
a banana?

02:59.510 --> 03:01.637
THAT GOT MOVED
TO THURSDAY.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.609
UH-HUH.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.639
WHAT?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.740
WHEN DID THAT
GET ON THE SCHEDULE?

03:08.780 --> 03:11.544
N-NO, IT'S FINE.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.514
DID SHE SAY WHAT
THE APPOINTMENT'S ABOUT?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.619
I'M JUST SURPRISED,
THAT'S ALL.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.878
OKAY. THANKS, DENISE.
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I GET IN.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.523
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

03:25.500 --> 03:29.231
MRS. PO'I'I'ER MADE AN APPOINTMENT
TO SEE ME THIS WEEK.

03:29.270 --> 03:33.229
THE LENDER...
OF OUR UNAUTHORIZED LOAN.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.908
I THOUGHT SHE
CAME TO THE BANK
ONCE A YEAR.

03:35.940 --> 03:37.646
YEAH, WELL,
SHE'S A YEAR EARLY,

03:37.680 --> 03:39.614
AND I'M $50,000 SHORT.

03:39.650 --> 03:40.947
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

03:45.620 --> 03:47.508
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO SCHOOL.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.609
HEY.
HEY...

04:11.650 --> 04:13.572
JASON. I'M--

04:13.620 --> 04:15.815
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR WORKOUT. THIS CAN WAIT.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.842
REALLY. IT DIDN'T
SOUND THAT WAY ON THE PHONE.

04:18.890 --> 04:21.586
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK IN TOWN?

04:21.620 --> 04:24.521
JUST...TAKING CARE
OF FAMILY BUSINESS.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.258
SPENCER,
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

04:29.530 --> 04:30.861
( sighs )

04:34.770 --> 04:36.761
THIS WAS SENT TO ME.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.779
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN
FROM THE SECOND FLOOR
OF YOUR HOUSE.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.074
YEAH. IT DOES.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.647
SO, WHY DO YOU SOUND
NOT CONVINCED?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.318
LOOK, AFTER ALI DISAPPEARED,

04:46.350 --> 04:48.841
WE GOT BIZARRE THINGS
IN THE MAIL.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.440
SYMPATHY CARDS FROM STRANGERS

04:51.490 --> 04:54.357
AND LETTERS WITH
CONSPIRACY THEORIES

04:54.390 --> 04:55.880
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER...

04:55.920 --> 04:57.729
SOMETIMES IT WAS PHOTOS--

04:57.760 --> 05:01.856
BLURRY IMAGES OF A BLOND GIRL
RUNNING AWAY FROM THE CAMERA.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.994
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY ALI.
AND IT'S MY YARD.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.066
AND IT WAS TAKEN
THE NIGHT THAT
SHE DISAPPEARED.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.988
I MEAN, LOOK.
SHE'S GOT THE SAME
YELLOW TOP ON.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.860
SPENCER,
THEY HAVE PROGRAMS NOW

05:10.910 --> 05:13.936
THAT MAKE PHOTOSHOP LOOK LIKE
SCISSORS AND A GLUE STICK.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.107
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.005
MY FAMILY HIRED A P.I.,

05:18.050 --> 05:21.816
I'LL TAKE THE PICTURE TO HIM
AND SEE WHAT HE COMES UP WITH.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.415
SPENCER.

05:28.460 --> 05:32.749
ALI'S MEMORIAL WAS
THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.859
I WAS A JERK.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.788
I-I KNOW THAT NOW.

05:38.830 --> 05:42.709
WELL, THAT WASN'T THE TERM
THAT I WOULD HAVE USED, BUT...

05:43.810 --> 05:44.902
IT WORKS.

06:08.130 --> 06:09.893
GOOD TIME.

06:14.670 --> 06:15.830
EASE UP, FIELDS.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.009
THIS IS A PRACTICE,
NOT A MEET.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.736
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
ATE THEIR WHEATIES
THIS MORNING.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.475
WAY TO HUSTLE,
EMILY.
THANKS, COACH.

06:22.510 --> 06:24.398
PAIGE,
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
SOME COMPETITION.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.077
EMILY, REMEMBER,
SHE LIKES TO WIN.

06:26.110 --> 06:28.146
HAPPY TO HAVE HER BACK.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.080
SO, IS THIS
FOR REAL THIS TIME?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.747
CAN WE COUNT ON YOU
FOR THE FULL SEASON?

06:31.790 --> 06:35.453
YEAH. I WAS DISTRACT ED
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

06:35.490 --> 06:36.457
THAT'S OVER NOW.

06:36.490 --> 06:39.152
OKAY. GOOD.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.726
Ashley; HANNA, STOP WORRYING.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
AT THIS POINT.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.863
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.538
HANNA. HI.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.209
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?
MY MOM.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.798
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.000
HMM?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.975
UH--YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.807
OH! HERE.

06:58.850 --> 07:02.809
I FORGOT TO GIVE THESE
TO YOU LAST NIGHT.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.818
THANK YOU.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.681
OH, I OWE YOU BIG-TIME.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.859
ARE YOU SURE YOUR DAD'S
NOT GONNA MISS THESE?

07:08.890 --> 07:10.152
OH, PLEASE.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.158
HE JOINED THE MUSEUM BOARD
FOR NETWORKING.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.828
THE MAN DOESN'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

07:13.860 --> 07:15.748
A MONET AND A MOJITO.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.222
WELL, HEY,
HOW CAN I GET YOU BACK?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.728
PAY FOR THE EXTRA TOPPINGS
ON MY PIZZA DELIVERY.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.466
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.
OH, AND A DVD RENTAL,

07:23.510 --> 07:26.035
BECAUSE IF I HAVE TO HOLE UP IN
MY ROOM ALL NIGHT AS YOUR ALIBI,

07:26.070 --> 07:27.970
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT
WITH JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.001
WAIT. WHAT ALIBI?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.847
AREN'T YOU BOTH GOING
TO THE MUSEUM THINGIE?

07:31.880 --> 07:33.108
NO, UM...

07:33.150 --> 07:36.210
SPENCER GOT THE TICKETS FOR...

07:36.250 --> 07:37.740
ME AND EZRA.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.485
YOU'RE TAKING MR. FITZ?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.216
I REALLY WISH
YOU'D JUST CALL HIM EZRA.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.081
AND YES, I'M TAKING HIM.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.792
HE JUST...
DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.559
IT'S A SURPRISE.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.068
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FIGURED THAT
A DATE OUT OF TOWN

07:52.100 --> 07:54.989
WOULD GIVE US A CHANCE
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A DATE.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.905
YEAH. UH, I GET IT.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.204
YOU GUYS DO KIND OF HAVE
THE SOCIAL LIVES OF SHUT-INS.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.579
GIRLS?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.917
HI.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.986
HEY, EVERYONE?

08:10.020 --> 08:12.147
CAN I GET EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

08:13.860 --> 08:17.785
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT TEAM SPIRIT LATELY.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.254
WHAT IS SPIRIT?
AND HOW CAN WE CREATE--

08:21.300 --> 08:24.519
ACTUALLY, CAN YOU
NOT OPEN YOUR PRESENTS
UNTIL AFTER I'M DONE?

08:24.570 --> 08:25.969
UM...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.093
LIKE I WAS SAYING,

08:28.140 --> 08:30.859
A LEADER INSPIRES SPIRIT.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.028
THESE ARE MY GIFT TO YOU
TO BOOST MORALE--

08:35.080 --> 08:36.809
ALL RIGHTY, PAIGE,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.806
I'M SURE EVERYBODY
APPRECIATES YOUR GIFTS,

08:38.850 --> 08:40.272
BUT I WANT YOU SWIMMIN',
NOT SHOPPIN'.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.276
ALL RIGHT!
LISTEN UP, SHARKS!

08:42.320 --> 08:44.083
I WANT YOU FOCUSED.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.179
LIKE EMILY.

08:46.220 --> 08:50.020
SHE RENEWED HER COMMITMENT
AND BROKE A RECORD TODAY!

08:50.060 --> 08:51.982
( cheers, applause )

08:52.030 --> 08:54.021
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!
I LIKE THAT!

08:54.060 --> 08:56.620
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
LET'S GET BACK TO CLASS.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.194
COME ON! COME ON!

09:03.870 --> 09:04.905
HEY, PAIGE,

09:04.940 --> 09:06.259
I JUST--

09:19.860 --> 09:21.657
HEY.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.329
MISS MONTGOMERY.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.957
UM...

09:28.000 --> 09:31.959
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
LOOK OVER MY READING ASSIGNMENT.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.232
PERHAPS THIS COULD WAIT
UNTIL AFTER THE MAKEUP TEST
HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.204
ACTUALLY...

09:38.240 --> 09:41.835
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF
YOU COULD JUST REVIEW IT NOW

09:41.880 --> 09:44.178
SO I KNOW I'M ON
THE RIGHT TRACK?

09:45.310 --> 09:46.743
OKAY.

09:51.950 --> 09:54.384
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY WORK SO FAR?

09:54.420 --> 09:56.786
( clears throat )

09:56.830 --> 09:58.388
LOOKS OUTSTANDING.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.852
GREAT.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.393
THEN I'LL TURN IT IN
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.625
GREAT.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.907
( line ringing )

10:15.940 --> 10:17.805
HI, THIS IS ASHLEY MARIN.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.977
PLEASE LEAVE ME A MESSAGE,
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.647
HANNA, WE MISSED YOU
IN P.E. AGAIN TODAY.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.089
I MISSED YOU TOO.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.851
OH. WELL, THAT'S THE THIRD TIME
YOU'VE DITCHED P.E.,

10:29.890 --> 10:32.825
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GIVE YOU DETENTION FOR
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.055
EXCUSE ME,
BUT MY ANKLE
IS STILL THROBBING.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.921
MM-HMM.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD,
BUT I GOT HIT BY A CAR.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.438
I HEARD, BUT I ALSO
SAW YOU COMPLETE

10:40.470 --> 10:43.007
THE SIX-HOUR DANCE
MARATHON ON SATURDAY.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.008
THAT WAS FOR A GOOD CAUSE,
AND MY ADRENALINE KICKED IN.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.133
YOU KNOW WHEN MOMS
GET SUPER-HUMAN STRENGTH

10:47.180 --> 10:51.207
WHEN THEIR KIDS ARE
TRAPPED UNDER A TREE
OR, UH, A HUMMER?

10:51.250 --> 10:54.071
IS THAT WHO PULLED YOU OUT
FROM UNDER THE CAR?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.372
OKAY, WELL,
CALL YOUR SUPER-MOMMY

10:56.420 --> 10:58.980
AND TELL HER THAT YOU'LL BE
COMING HOME LATE THIS WEEK.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.919
SKIPPING GYM?

11:04.960 --> 11:07.394
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO EARN
SOME BAD GIRL STRIPES,

11:07.430 --> 11:08.954
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.969
IF YOU'RE PROPOSING
THAT WE GET MATCHING TATTOOS,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.888
THE ANSWER IS NO.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.353
MOM?

12:10.390 --> 12:13.291
HEY, SWEETIE.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.389
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:17.270 --> 12:20.034
I, UH, I THOUGHT
I'D MAKE SOME PANCAKES.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.265
I HAVEN'T
MADE 'EM IN A WHILE.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.305
YOU WANT TO GET THE MIX?
IT'S IN THAT CABINET.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.379
YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS,

12:39.420 --> 12:43.527
BUT WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY...

12:43.560 --> 12:46.222
GAVE YOU THE STITCHES
BEHIND YOUR EAR,

12:46.260 --> 12:49.149
THEY WANTED TO SHAVE OFF
ALL YOUR HAIR ON THAT SIDE.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.191
AND I TOLD THEM, "NO WAY.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.358
"I KNOW MY KID, AND SHE
MAY BE UNCONSCIOUS NOW,

12:54.400 --> 12:56.334
"BUT IF SHE WAKES UP
WITH A SHAVED HEAD,

12:56.370 --> 12:59.464
SHE IS GONNA GO INTO
PERMANENT SHOCK."

13:03.080 --> 13:05.071
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

13:05.110 --> 13:08.568
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU WILL ALWAYS...

13:08.620 --> 13:10.941
BE MY BABY GIRL,

13:10.990 --> 13:14.380
AND I WILL ALWAYS FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

13:19.530 --> 13:22.351
( sniffling )

13:26.100 --> 13:28.466
YOU WANT SOME BACON?
I'LL MAKE SOME BACON.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.521
PRETTY.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.652
THAN KS.

14:26.690 --> 14:29.124
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR TIMES TODAY.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.469
FIRST FREESTYLE,
NOW BUTTERFLY--

14:31.500 --> 14:35.459
YOU BREAK ANY MORE RECORDS
AND WE'LL HAVE TO TEST YOU
FOR DOPING.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.592
BRING IT ON.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.236
YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE
THAN BREAK RECORDS

14:41.280 --> 14:43.373
IF YOU WANT TO
BECOME TEAM CAPTAIN.

14:43.410 --> 14:45.139
WHO SAID I WANTED
TO BECOME CAPTAIN?

14:45.180 --> 14:46.477
COME ON, EMILY.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.239
YOU CHECKED OUT
ON THIS TEAM FOR MONTHS,

14:48.280 --> 14:50.510
AND NOW YOU CHECK BACK IN
AND ACT LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT?

14:50.550 --> 14:52.108
OF COURS YOU'RE
GUNNING FOR CAPTAIN.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.618
I'M NOT GUNNING
FOR ANYTHING.
GOOD.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.379
BECAUSE BEING SO INTO
THE BREAST STROKE

14:57.430 --> 15:00.354
COULD REALLY END UP
HURTING YOU.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.563
IT MEANS WE ALL KNOW
WHAT TEAM YOU REALLY PLAY FOR.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.592
( scoffs )
YOU KNOW WHAT, PAIGE?
YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.337
IF YOU WANT TO BEAT ME,
WORK HARDER.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.372
HEY, HAN.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.978
OH, HEY.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.238
SO, I'M GONNA GET
A MANI-PEDI AFTER SCHOOL.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.518
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

15:58.550 --> 16:00.450
UH, I CAN'T.
I'VE GOT HOMEWORK.

16:00.490 --> 16:03.687
HOMEWORK? WHAT SUBJECT
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU
THAN YOUR CUTICLES?

16:07.630 --> 16:09.359
HEY...

16:09.400 --> 16:10.662
WHY ARE YOU SO DOWN?

16:10.700 --> 16:13.134
IS IT ABOUT
YOU AND JOHN BREAKING UP?

16:13.170 --> 16:16.367
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GIVE UP ON HIM.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.209
BELIEVE ME,
WITH ALL THE STUFF

16:18.240 --> 16:19.707
THAT EZRA AND I
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH,

16:19.740 --> 16:22.208
WE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HISTORY BY NOW.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.243
WELL, MAYBE IT'S A SIGN
FROM THE UNIVERSE.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.317
MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST...
COOL OFF FOR A WHILE.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.181
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"COOL OFF"?

16:30.220 --> 16:32.188
TAKE A BREAK.

16:32.220 --> 16:36.213
DON'T SEE EACH OTHER IN ROSEWOOD
OR...ANYPLACE ELSE.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.697
HON ESTLY?

16:40.730 --> 16:44.188
I CAN DEAL WITH THE UNIVERSE
THROWING ME CURVEBALLS,

16:44.230 --> 16:47.199
BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA START
COMING FROM MY BEST FRIEND,
THEN I HAVE A PROBLEM.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.435
ARIA, YOU HAVE TO
SNEAK OFF TO PHILLY

16:49.470 --> 16:51.665
JUST TO HAVE A DATE WITH HIM.
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT ME
TO BE WITH HIM.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.372
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.
HE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO'S HURTING ME.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.207
PLEASE, JUST DON'T GO
TONIGHT, OKAY?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.606
I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS DATE.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.515
I THINK THAT BAD FEELING
IS CALLED "JEALOUSY."

17:00.550 --> 17:02.415
THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.
REALLY?

17:02.450 --> 17:04.680
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

17:13.230 --> 17:15.755
WHY IS THIS CALLED
"MEAT" CASSEROLE?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.564
THAT LUNCH LADY
HAS A GIFT FOR SUSPENSE.

17:20.370 --> 17:21.837
WHERE'S HANNA?

17:21.870 --> 17:23.599
WHO CARES.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.107
WHAT?

17:27.340 --> 17:28.375
I DON'T KNOW.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.699
EM, HOW'S SWIM PRACTICE?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.741
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

17:33.780 --> 17:38.342
OKAY. I'VE HEARD
OF COMMUNAL CRAMPS,
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.689
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT
"FIRST REAL DATE" EXCITEMENT?

17:41.720 --> 17:45.121
I MEAN, YESTERDAY YOU WERE
READY TO GIVE ME TONGUE
FOR GIVING YOU TWO TICKETS.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.594
YOU'RE NOT “IN-LC? IT ANYMORE?

17:47.630 --> 17:49.689
I MEAN, YES.

17:49.730 --> 17:52.119
YEAH, I'M...SO INTO IT.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.695
WE'RE...GONNA HAVE
AN AMAZING TIME TONIGHT.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.129
OKAY, SO...

17:57.170 --> 17:58.808
TALK. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR?

17:58.840 --> 18:02.708
I CAN'T DECIDE
BETWEEN MY BACKLESS
OR MY STRAPLESS.

18:02.740 --> 18:06.642
GO WITH THE RED ONE. BE BOLD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, EM?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.616
ABOUT WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

18:10.650 --> 18:14.814
IT'S NOTHING.
JUST SOME GIRL ON MY SWIM TEAM
WHO WANTS ME TO DISAPPEAR.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.556
WHAT'S HER NAME?
PAIGE MCCULLERS.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.387
OH. I KNOW HER.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.297
WE PLAYED FIELD HOCKEY TOGETHER.
WE NAMED A PENALTY AFTER HER.

18:22.330 --> 18:26.721
WHAT'D SHE SAY?
SOME SNARKY COMMENT
ABOUT ME BEING GAY.

18:26.770 --> 18:29.591
I WILL DESTROY HER.
CAN I HELP?

18:29.640 --> 18:31.733
IT'S OKAY.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

18:31.770 --> 18:35.228
ANYONE ELSE THIRSTY?
I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.802
WHO'S THIS FROM?

18:38.850 --> 18:41.842
PAIGE. WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

18:41.880 --> 18:46.112
SHE'S TRYING TO BRIBE
HER WAY TO BECOMING
THE NEXT TEAM CAPTAIN.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.849
DO YOU...THINK
THEY'RE FROM THE SAME PLACE?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.765
IT'S POSSIBLE.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.461
IF THEY WERE,
MAYBE THE STORE OWNER

19:00.500 --> 19:01.933
COULD TELL US WHO BOUGHT
THE FAKE ALISON BRACELET.

19:01.970 --> 19:03.699
YEAH, OR MAYBE EVEN
THE JENNA ONE.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.833
AND WE WOULD KNOW
WHO "A" IS.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.304
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

19:13.880 --> 19:18.510
CHAMBERLAIN EMPLOYED A POLICY
WHERE CONCESSIONS WERE MADE
IN ORDER TO AVOID WAR.

19:18.550 --> 19:21.781
WHO CAN TELL ME
IF APPEASEMENT ACTUALLY WORKED?

19:21.820 --> 19:22.855
ANYBODY?

19:22.890 --> 19:23.925
IT DIDN'T.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.882
WHEN THE TERRITORY WAS ANNEXED,

19:25.930 --> 19:28.649
HITLER'S AGGRESSION
ONLY INCREASED.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.964
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO
SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS

19:31.000 --> 19:33.230
ON WHY APPEASEMENT
DID NOT WORK?

19:33.270 --> 19:34.965
SPENCER.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.867
BECAUSE GIVING IN
TO A BULLY NEVER WORKS.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.969
CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT
A LITTLE BIT?

19:40.010 --> 19:43.741
EVEN IF YOU GIVE THEM
EVERYTHING THAT THEY ASK FOR,
IT'LL NEVER BE ENOUGH.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.668
YOUR ONLY CHOICE
IS TO STAND UP TO THEM,

19:45.710 --> 19:47.769
EVEN IF IT COSTS YOU
SOMETHING.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.776
( bell rings )
VERY NICE.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.744
OKAY, PEOPLE,
PLEASE DO NOT RACE ME
TOWARDS THE DOOR,

19:52.790 --> 19:54.485
IT HURTS MY FEELINGS.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.751
TERM PAPER IS NEXT WEEK.
DON'T FORGET.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.220
Hanna:
MRS.MONTGOMERW

20:08.540 --> 20:10.735
MS. MARIN,
DETENTION IS THAT WAY.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.738
I KNOW, BUT I HAVE TO
TALK TO MRS. MONTGOMERY.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.237
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.679
IT CAN'T. I HAVE TO
TALK TO HER TODAY.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.201
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT EARLIER. MOVE IT.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.287
TAKE IT INSIDE,
TAKE IT INSIDE.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.759
WHOA. ARE YOU
STALKING ME?

20:40.800 --> 20:43.837
YEAH. CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF THAT KNOCK-OFF COLOGNE.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.731
HEY, PRINCESS.
WHERE YA GOIN'?

20:49.780 --> 20:51.645
THE PRINCESS
NEEDS A PEE.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.275
GOOD LUCK. WE GET OUR
BATHROOM BREAK AT TEN AFTER.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.642
( sighs ) I HAVE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:58.690 --> 20:59.816
WHAT'S THE HURRY?

20:59.850 --> 21:01.613
YOU WANT TO BE
THE FIRST IN LINE

21:01.660 --> 21:03.685
TO SEE YOUR BOY
JUSTIN BIEBER'S NEW MOVIE?

21:03.730 --> 21:06.858
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NOT JUST A MOVIE--
IT'S HIS REAL STORY.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.824
ABOUT WHAT--HIS HAIR?

21:08.860 --> 21:11.294
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST DON'T TALK
ABOUT THE BEEBS, OKAY?

21:11.330 --> 21:13.935
YOU DON'T KNOW THE BEEBS,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BEEBS.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.767
OR HIS HAIR.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.803
CALM DOWN, GIRL.
IT'S ONLY AN HOUR.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.877
IN AN HOUR SHE'LL
ALREADY BE IN PHILLY.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.674
WHO?
MRS. MONTGOMERY.

21:24.710 --> 21:27.816
THE TEACHER?
WHY DO YOU CARE?

21:27.850 --> 21:29.977
FORGET TO TURN IN
YOUR HﬁgEWORK?

21:30.020 --> 21:33.046
BUT IF SHE GETS THERE...

21:33.090 --> 21:35.615
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA GET HURT.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.322
IS MRS. MONTGOMERY
RUNNING A TERRORIST CELL?

21:38.360 --> 21:39.679
WHY AM I EVEN
TALKING TO YOU?

21:39.730 --> 21:42.722
JUST TURN AROUND,
SKETCHY.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.734
( clears throat )

21:48.800 --> 21:51.337
WHY DO YOU
GET TO LEAVE?

21:51.370 --> 21:52.860
HMM.

21:52.910 --> 21:55.879
MY SOCIAL WORKER
JUST HAD ME EXCUSED.

21:55.910 --> 21:59.073
YOU KNOW,
EMAIL IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.670
MEET MY SOCIAL WORKER.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.857
* TAKE A LOOK
AT WHERE WE ARE *

22:08.890 --> 22:11.120
* SOMEHOW WE HAVE FOUND
( door buzzer)

22:11.160 --> 22:14.721
* THE POINT OF NO RETURN

22:14.760 --> 22:18.059
* THERE'S NO TIME,
NO WAY OUT *

22:18.100 --> 22:20.091
* GOTTA CROSS THIS BRIDGE

22:20.130 --> 22:22.439
* WE WILL WATCH IT BURN...

22:33.520 --> 22:35.909
( cell phone rings )

22:35.950 --> 22:37.941
HELLO.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.912
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?

22:39.950 --> 22:42.009
YOU LOOK GOOD.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.895
( laughs )

22:47.930 --> 22:50.421
I-I THOUGHT WE WERE
TAKING THE TRAIN.

22:50.470 --> 22:54.531
I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR HEART
SET ON BEING COUGHED ON
BY COMMUTERS, BUT..

22:54.570 --> 22:58.961
SO THIS IS WHAT A REAL DATE
WITH EZRADFAT/IZNLOOKS LIKE.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.129
YOU CAN HANG UP NOW.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.483
( bell rings )

23:48.660 --> 23:52.152
( engine not starting )

23:52.190 --> 23:54.158
( sighs )

23:57.700 --> 23:59.793
I GOT A MESSAGE
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.138
YE--

24:05.710 --> 24:07.132
HAVE A SEAT, GIRLS.

24:12.580 --> 24:16.516
AN INCIDENT INVOLVING
A HOMOPHOBIC COMMENT

24:16.550 --> 24:18.609
HAS BEEN BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION.

24:18.650 --> 24:22.108
NOW, WE HAVE A ZERO
TOLERANCE POLICY--

24:22.160 --> 24:23.718
COACH WALTON,

24:23.760 --> 24:26.957
WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN US,
IT'S OVER NOW.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.651
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

24:28.700 --> 24:30.793
AND THEN I'LL DECIDE
IF IT'S OVER.

24:32.730 --> 24:35.836
THERE IS REALLY
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.671
IN THAT CASE,
YOU CAN GO, PAIGE.

24:47.050 --> 24:50.588
EMILY, IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED,

24:50.620 --> 24:52.588
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP YOU.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.588
IT WAS JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

24:58.630 --> 24:59.858
CAN I GO?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.737
DID YOU TURN THE KEY
QUICKLY?

25:09.770 --> 25:12.659
YES, I DID.
ANY QUICKER AND IT'LL
SNAP OFF IN MY HAND.

25:12.710 --> 25:14.234
OF COURSE THE CAR
HAD TO BREAK DOWN

25:14.280 --> 25:16.168
WHEN I'M ON MY WAY
TO AN ART OPENING.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.178
WHY COULDN'T IT BREAK DOWN
WHEN I'M ON MY WAY TO, SAY,

25:18.210 --> 25:20.041
I DON'T KNOW, JURY DUTY?

25:20.080 --> 25:22.742
IT HASN'T BROKEN DOWN.
IT'S THE KILL SWITCH.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.247
TRY IT AGAIN.
GO AHEAD, JIGGLE IT.

25:24.290 --> 25:28.158
I DID JIGGLE IT.
WELL, TRY IT AGAIN.

25:28.190 --> 25:31.648
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO MASTER
THE FINER ART OF JIGGLING

25:31.690 --> 25:33.794
IF YOU HAD JUST LISTENED TO ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.695
ELLA, PLEASE, NOT AGAIN.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.152
I BEGGED YOU NOT TO BUY
A USED CAR WITH A KILL SWITCH.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.122
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A KILL SWITCH WAS.

25:39.170 --> 25:42.094
IT'S A SWITCH THAT STOPS
THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
TO THE ENGINE

25:42.140 --> 25:44.165
SO THAT THIEVES
CANNOT STEAL THE CAR!

25:44.210 --> 25:47.771
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW,
AFTER I EXPLAINED IT TO YOU.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.732
THAT'S IT.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.077
I WILL HITCHHIKE.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.271
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEXT TIME CALL AAA

25:55.320 --> 25:57.584
INSTEAD OF MAKING ME
DRIVE ALL THE WAY

25:57.620 --> 25:58.712
OUT OF MY WAY
TO HELP YOU.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.183
I DID CALL AAA,

26:00.220 --> 26:02.814
AND WE HAVE USED UP OUR
ENTIRE TOWING ALLOWANCES.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.327
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

26:04.360 --> 26:08.797
IT IS WHEN YOU DRIVE A USED CAR
WITH A STUPID KILL SWITCH!

26:08.830 --> 26:10.627
( sighs )

26:12.270 --> 26:13.225
JASON.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.898
YOUR HOUSEKEEPER LET ME IN,

26:15.940 --> 26:17.828
SAID I COULD
WAIT FOR YOU HERE.

26:19.710 --> 26:23.669
SO...WHAT DID YOUR
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR SAY?

26:25.310 --> 26:28.871
WELL, THE PICTURE...

26:28.920 --> 26:31.081
IS REAL.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.714
AND FOR ALL I KNOW,
I MAY HAVE TAKEN IT.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.785
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN IT?

26:35.820 --> 26:37.720
I HONESTLY DON'T REMEMBER.

26:37.760 --> 26:42.129
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT
THAT WHOLE AUGUST IS A BLUR.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.129
I WAS HIGH FOR MOST OF IT.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.819
YOU WERE?

26:46.870 --> 26:48.861
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.369
IT'S JUST TO ME
YOU WERE ALWAYS

26:53.410 --> 26:56.208
ALI'S STRANGE OLDER BROTHER.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.778
WE NEVER SAW YOU.
YOU WERE ALWAYS BEHIND
A CLOSED DOOR.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.141
YEAH--

27:01.180 --> 27:05.219
GETTING HIGH WITH
A BUNCH OF LOSERS.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.310
YOU REMEMBER THAT PHONY
YOUR SISTER USED TO DATE?

27:08.360 --> 27:11.158
IAN? IAN THOMAS?

27:12.430 --> 27:14.318
WE PARTIED THAT WHOLE SUMMER.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.419
AFTER HE BROKE UP
WITH YOUR SISTER,

27:16.460 --> 27:18.325
HE PRACTICALLY
LIVED AT MY HOUSE.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.237
BUT IAN'S A TRIATH LETE.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.135
HE'S THE POSTER BOY
FOR PREPPY.

27:23.170 --> 27:26.765
POSTER BOY BY DAY
AND PARTY BOY BY NIGHT.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.971
CONVINCING THOUGH,
ISN'T HE?

27:34.920 --> 27:38.117
I DON'T GET IT.
THIS ALWAYS FIXES IT.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.857
YOU CAN ONLY REPAIR THINGS
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE THEY
BREAK FOR GOOD.

27:40.890 --> 27:43.017
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

27:43.060 --> 27:46.757
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CAR.
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

27:46.790 --> 27:48.758
YES.

27:51.100 --> 27:55.161
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
I CAN CALL A CAB.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.963
MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU'LL FIND A DATE

27:57.000 --> 27:59.207
CLASSY ENOUGH
TO PICK YOU UP.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.037
I'M NOT MEETING A DATE.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.049
THIS TICKET WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY THE P.T.A. ONE TICKET.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.709
YOU'RE THE ONE
WEARING A NEW SHIRT--
ARE Y GOING ON A DATE?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.949
OH, MY GOD...

28:12.990 --> 28:14.981
YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.750
ELLA, I DON'T WANT TO--
YOU BOUGHT A NEW SHIRT
FOR THIS PERSON.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.087
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY SOMETHING?

28:19.130 --> 28:22.725
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO DISCUSS.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.899
HAVE YOU BEEN
WORKING OUT?

28:24.930 --> 28:27.296
ELLA.
WHAT?

28:27.330 --> 28:30.060
YOU WALKED OUT ON ME.
REMEMBER?

28:37.410 --> 28:39.401
I THINK
I NEED TO CALL A CAB

28:39.450 --> 28:41.975
UH, IF I'M GOING
TO MAKE IT ON TIME.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.510
NO, I'LL DRIVE YOU.
NO, NO, NO.

28:43.550 --> 28:46.110
WE BOTH DON'T
HAVE TO BE LATE.

28:46.150 --> 28:48.755
NO. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LATE,
AND NEITHER AM I.

28:48.790 --> 28:52.487
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S FINE, I'LL DRIVE YOU.

28:52.530 --> 28:56.523
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
IAN SPENT THAT WHOLE SUMMER
AT ALISON'S HOUSE.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.461
WATCHING ALISON.
I'M OFFICIALLY
CREEPED OUT.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.038
CAN YOU BE CREEPED OUT AND EAT
AT THE SAME TIME? FASTER?

29:03.070 --> 29:04.958
WHY DO WE HAVE TO
EAT DINNER AT FOUR-THIRTY?

29:05.010 --> 29:07.979
BECAUSE THIS APPOINTMENT
IS AT FIVE, AND IT'S FAR AWAY,

29:08.010 --> 29:10.035
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
WE'RE GONNA BE THERE.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.378
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
WHEN MY BLOOD SUGAR DROPS.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.344
WHY DO I HAVE TO EAT?

29:14.380 --> 29:16.371
OH. I GUESS YOU DON'T.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.547
AND WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR A BEAD SHOP?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.184
BECAUSE THIS SHOP
IS AT HER HOME.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.450
SOUNDS LIKE SHE MAKES
DREAM CATCHERS IN HER KITCHEN.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.481
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT THAT?
I'M STUFFED.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.499
IF I EAT ANY MORE
I'LL BE SWIMMING
IN TWO LANES.

29:28.530 --> 29:31.499
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LANE
AND PAIGE'S LANE.

29:31.530 --> 29:33.259
DID THE COACH
KICK HER OFF THE TEAM?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.961
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.968
FOR WHAT SHE SAID.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.366
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THE COACH KNEW ABOUT THAT?

29:39.410 --> 29:41.503
BECAUSE I TOLD HER.
WHAT?

29:41.540 --> 29:44.509
YOU SPOKE TO MY COACH?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

29:44.550 --> 29:47.201
BECAUSE THAT GIRL HAS BEEN
BULLYING PEOPLE SINCE J.V.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.512
AND SHE NEEDS TO BE
PUT IN HER PLACE.

29:48.550 --> 29:51.246
SHE WAS--BY ME,
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.019
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

29:53.050 --> 29:55.211
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D CARE
IF I SPOKE TO YOUR COACH.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.820
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FINE
WITH PEOPLE KNOWING THAT
YOU AND MAYA WERE A COUPLE.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.385
I AM. I'M NOT UPSET THAT
THE COACH KNOWS I'M GAY.

30:00.430 --> 30:03.092
I'M MAD BECAUSE IF I WANTED HER
TO KNOW WHAT PAIGE HAD SAID,

30:03.130 --> 30:05.121
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER MYSELF.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.422
I'M NOT SOME
HELPLESS LITTLE LAMB.
I KNOW THAT,

30:07.470 --> 30:09.859
BUT YOU'RE MY FRIEND
AND I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.367
WELL, I CAN
STAND UP FOR MYSELF.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.301
WELL, YOU NEVER DID
WITH ALISON.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.173
WOW.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.610
THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE
MY FEELINGS DIDN'T GET HURT.

30:22.650 --> 30:25.289
EMILY, I'M SORRY--
I HAVE TO GO.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.312
I JUST REMEMBERED
I HAVE A TEST TOMORROW.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.625
Ezra: SORRY,

30:36.660 --> 30:38.389
I JUST NEEDED
A BREATH OF
FRESH AIR.

30:38.430 --> 30:40.193
Aria: IT'S COOL.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.039
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE ARTIST
IS A NO-SHOW.

30:42.070 --> 30:45.460
IF SOMEBODY THREW ME A PARTY
WITH CHAMPAGNE AND CRAB CAKES

30:45.510 --> 30:48.479
TO CELEBRATE MY WORK,
I THINK I'D TRY AND STOP BY.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.375
YEAH. IF IT WERE MY WORK,

30:50.410 --> 30:53.538
I'D SHOW UP IF PEOPLE PUT OUT
FOLDING CHAIRS AND SWEATY JEANS.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.878
PLUS, I'D BE THERE.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.888
TRUE.

30:57.920 --> 31:01.651
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
THAT THE ARTIST DIDN'T SHOW UP?

31:01.690 --> 31:03.385
NO.

31:03.420 --> 31:07.322
THE ONLY PERSON I CARED
ABOUT SEEING IS YOU.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.089
I'M SORRY.
FOR A SECOND I FORGOT I WAS--

31:17.140 --> 31:20.337
NOT IN ROSEWOOD?
IT'S OKAY. ME TOO.

31:20.370 --> 31:24.443
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE LIMO,
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK.

31:34.390 --> 31:37.279
YEAH. I COULD
GET USED TO THIS.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.995
READY FOR MORE CULTURE?

31:46.230 --> 31:47.959
LEAD THE WAY.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.268
HI, MOM.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.686
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:04.720 --> 32:08.952
I COULDN'T JUST SIT AROUND
IN MY ROOM AND WAIT.

32:08.990 --> 32:11.550
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY TO HER?

32:11.590 --> 32:13.455
I NEED YOU TO GO HOME.

32:13.490 --> 32:16.357
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
TELL HER THE TRUTH?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.391
HAN NA, PLEASE.

32:18.430 --> 32:21.638
I CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.278
SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

32:30.310 --> 32:32.403
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH MRS. POTTER'S HOUSEKEEPER.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.611
SHE CALLED FROM
THE HOSPITAL.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.538
MRS. POTTER
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.412
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.280
THEY COULDN'T REVIVE HER.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.585
POOR THING. I MEAN,
SHE WASN'T YOUNG, BUT STILL...

32:46.630 --> 32:49.394
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME,
DENISE.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.971
I KNOW, BABY.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.611
THAT SMELL
NEVER WENT AWAY.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.379
IT CAME WITH THE CAR.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.718
NO, ACTUALLY IT CAME
FROM MIKE DROPPING
A TURKEY WRAP

33:15.760 --> 33:17.512
UNDERNEATH
THE DRIVER'S SEAT,
REMEMBER?

33:17.560 --> 33:20.358
IT HAD BEEN THERE FOR,
LIKE, A YEAR OR SOMETHING?

33:20.390 --> 33:23.621
MORE. BY THE TIME WE FOUND IT,
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ROAST BEEF.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.026
( laughs )
I DID.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.233
AH.
YEAH.

33:30.270 --> 33:33.262
OH, YOU HAVE
ENOUGH CASH FOR
A CAB RIDE HOME?

33:33.310 --> 33:35.232
YEAH.
OKAY.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.272
WELL, SO,
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.470
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.579
THAN KS.

33:43.620 --> 33:46.418
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DROVE ME
ALL THE WAY HERE.

33:46.450 --> 33:47.587
WHY?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.612
I JUST--

33:50.660 --> 33:53.527
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE
WHO WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.051
WELL, IT'S ONLY FAIR.
I MEAN, I WAS THE ONE

33:56.100 --> 33:58.694
WHO SUGGESTED THAT
WE BUY A USED CAR
WITH A KILL SWITCH.

34:04.570 --> 34:05.559
GOODBYE.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.533
GOODBYE.

34:21.790 --> 34:25.829
( chuckling ) WELL, I KNOW
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.226
OH, HERE IT IS.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.263
I HAVE WONDERFUL
EARRINGS TO MATCH.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.165
THAN KS, BUT, UM,

34:33.200 --> 34:36.533
I JUST CAME HERE TO FIND OUT
WHO BOUGHT THESE TWO BRACELETS.

34:36.570 --> 34:39.266
OH, WELL, LET ME SEE.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.800
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU

34:40.840 --> 34:43.877
THESE BRACELETS WERE MADE
WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

34:43.910 --> 34:47.676
I CHANGED VENDORS.
PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE CLASPS.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.644
YOU DO KEEP RECORDS,
RIGHT?

34:49.680 --> 34:52.285
YES, DEAR, I'M TRYING,

34:52.320 --> 34:56.313
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M A LITTLE BETTER
AT BEADING THAN ORGANIZING.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.555
PLEASE,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.127
WAIT A MINUTE. OH. OH.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.821
HERE IT IS!
YOU FOUND IT?

35:02.860 --> 35:06.660
YES! NOW,
THESE TWO WERE PURCHASED

35:06.700 --> 35:09.168
BY A SPENCER HASTINGS.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.600
DOES THAT HELP, DEAR?

35:27.190 --> 35:28.885
ARIA?

35:28.920 --> 35:30.683
HEY.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.756
I WAS JUST CALLING YOU.

35:32.790 --> 35:36.191
YEAH, I'VE KIND OF
BEEN AVOIDING YOU.

35:36.230 --> 35:37.754
I KIND OF GOT THAT FEELING.

35:37.800 --> 35:42.464
LISTEN, I NEED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.899
LAST NIGHT--

35:46.940 --> 35:50.398
LAST NIGHT WAS ONE OF
THE BEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.203
WAIT. DID YOU GO
TO THE MUSEUM?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.673
YEAH, IN A LIMO.

35:54.720 --> 35:59.419
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT MADE IT LESS THAN PERFECT
WAS BEING IN A FIGHT WITH YOU.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.179
I'M SORRY, HANNA,

36:01.220 --> 36:04.326
I'M...I'M SORRY FOR
GOING OFF ON YOU LIKE THAT.

36:04.360 --> 36:08.854
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY?
BEING WITH EZRA, IT'S A RISK...

36:08.900 --> 36:12.495
BUT HE'S SOMEONE THAT
I'M WILLING TO TAKE A RISK FOR.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.294
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.706
NO, IT DOESN'T.

36:18.740 --> 36:20.799
I GET IT.

36:22.910 --> 36:25.344
SO, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO SAY?

36:25.380 --> 36:26.847
NOTHING. UM...

36:26.880 --> 36:29.246
I'M JUST REALLY GLAD
IT WORKED OUT.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.244
OHH!

37:10.390 --> 37:12.358
(gasping )
WHAT THE HELL?!

37:12.390 --> 37:13.823
I SAW THE LINEUP.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.725
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.421
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:17.460 --> 37:19.963
COACH REPLACED ME
AS THE RELAY ANCHOR WITH YOU.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.332
SO GO AND TALK TO COACH!
LIKE YOU DID?

37:22.370 --> 37:26.909
I WOULD NEVER RAT OUT A TEAMMATE
BECAUSE MY FEELINGS WERE HURT.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.306
I TAKE CARE OF THINGS MYSELF.

37:39.450 --> 37:42.510
YOU ARE LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT STICKS TO THE SIDE OF BOATS

37:42.560 --> 37:44.482
THAT CAN ONLY BE REMOVED
WITH A HACKSAW OR SOMETHING.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.486
VERY NICE.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.498
I THOUGHT FANCY
ROSEWOOD GIRLS LIKE YOU

37:48.530 --> 37:50.327
KNEW HOW TO SAY "PLEASE"
AND "THANK YOU."

37:50.360 --> 37:53.488
WELL, PLEASE PEEL YOUR
SWEATY BODY OFF OF MY LOCKER.

37:53.530 --> 37:54.531
THANK YOU.

38:01.070 --> 38:04.073
SO, YOU WANT TO GIVE IT BACK
TO YOUR TEACHER, TOSS IT,

38:04.110 --> 38:07.876
OR, UH, PUT IT ON
YOUR CHARM BRACELET?
WHAT IS THAT?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.777
IT'S WHAT STOPPED
MRS. MONTGOMERY
FROM GETTING TO PHILLY.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.846
SHE DIDN'T GET THERE?
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

38:13.890 --> 38:16.017
YOU WANT A LESSON
IN POPULAR MECHANICS,

38:16.060 --> 38:18.051
OR DO YOU WANT TO
JUST SAY THANK YOU?

38:18.090 --> 38:19.887
NEITHER.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.490
SO, HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

38:22.530 --> 38:25.397
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.988
WELL, THEN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

38:28.500 --> 38:30.434
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.579
OH, AND, UM, BY THE WAY,
THEY'RE BARNACLES.

38:35.610 --> 38:37.032
WHAT?

38:37.080 --> 38:39.571
THE THINGS THAT
STICK ON THE SIDE OF BOATS.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.119
HEY, I WAS JUST
GOING TO TEXT YOU.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.025
WHY? WHAT'S UP?

38:59.070 --> 39:00.924
I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE DOING
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY

39:00.970 --> 39:03.894
AND HOPING YOU MIGHT WANT TO
GO CLOTHES SHOPPING WITH ME.

39:03.940 --> 39:07.398
SURE. WHY THE SUDDEN
URGE TO SPLURGE?

39:07.440 --> 39:10.432
I JUST THINK IT'S TIME
TO UPGRADE A LITTLE.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.472
SO, HOW WAS YOUR SLEEP-OVER
AT SPENCER'S?

39:13.510 --> 39:15.478
OH, YOU KNOW. THE USUAL.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.614
CHICK FLICK, POPCORN,
COSMO QUIZ, LIGHTS OUT.

39:18.650 --> 39:19.844
HOW ABOUT YOU?

39:19.890 --> 39:23.656
UH, ME?
UM, I HAD A GREAT NIGHT.

39:23.690 --> 39:26.488
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

39:26.530 --> 39:29.556
I WENT TO SEE THIS
REALLY WONDERFUL EXHIBIT.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.125
WHAT?

39:32.170 --> 39:33.967
YEAH, THEY HAD
A BIG OPENING

39:34.000 --> 39:35.968
AT THE PHILADELPHIA
ART MUSEUM.

39:38.100 --> 39:42.070
YOU--YOU WENT LAST NIGHT?
YEAH.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.601
OH, I KNOW,
PARTYING ON A SCHOOL NIGHT,

39:44.650 --> 39:46.868
I KNOW I'M OUT OF CONTROL,
BUT...

39:46.910 --> 39:49.470
IT WAS GREAT, IT WAS REALLY
EXCITING TO MEET THE ARTIST.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.647
IT WAS REALLY EXCITING.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.012
SO, ANYHOW, UM,
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS,
AND S0 DO YOU,

39:55.060 --> 39:56.982
SO MEET ME IN MY OFFICE
AFTER.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.124
YEAH. SURE.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.650
OKAY.

40:18.110 --> 40:19.646
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.978
WHY?
NOBODY'S HOME.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.147
YEAH, BUT MELISSA COULD
COME HOME ANY MINUTE.

40:24.180 --> 40:26.717
GOOD. I WANT HER TO.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.854
WHY ARE YOU
MAKING ME DO THIS?

40:28.890 --> 40:30.949
WHY DO YOU CARE
IF SHE KNOWS?

40:30.990 --> 40:32.981
I'M NOT MAKING YOU
DO ANYTHING, SPENCER.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.624
I'M TELLING YOU,
BY TOMORROW MORNING

40:35.660 --> 40:37.093
MELISSA WILL KNOW
EVERYTHING,

40:37.130 --> 40:39.121
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT

40:39.170 --> 40:42.094
EXCEPT LET HER HEAR IT
FROM YOU FIRST.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.096
FINE.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.028
I'LL TELL HER.

40:46.070 --> 40:47.628
YOU WIN.

40:47.670 --> 40:48.932
BUT THIS IT IS,

40:48.980 --> 40:51.642
BECAUSE I AM SICK
OF YOUR GAMES.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.999
WE ALL ARE.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.109
YOU TRYING TO GET ME
VOTED OFF THE ISLAND?

40:55.150 --> 40:57.015
IT WON'T WORK.

40:57.050 --> 40:59.689
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL
HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.814
I MADE YOU, SPENCER.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.851
I MADE ALL OF YOU.

41:04.890 --> 41:07.552
BEFORE ME, YOU WERE JUST
SOME GOODY-GOODY IN PLAID

41:07.590 --> 41:09.148
WHO DID WHATEVER
MOMMY AND DADDY TOLD HER TO.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.862
YOU ARE SO FULL
OF YOURSELF!

41:11.900 --> 41:14.118
YOU THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE
YOU BROUGHT US TOGETHER

41:14.170 --> 41:15.899
YOU CAN TREAT US
LIKE PUPPETS?

41:15.940 --> 41:19.762
BUT YOU ARE.
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

41:19.810 --> 41:22.199
YOU DON'T EXIST WITHOUT ME.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.105
REALLY, ALI?

41:24.140 --> 41:26.700
THEN TELL ME THIS--

41:26.750 --> 41:29.139
WHAT IS A LEADER
WITHOUT ANY FOLLOWERS?

41:29.180 --> 41:33.981
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER
WE WILL EXIST WITHOUT YOU,

41:34.020 --> 41:36.955
BUT WHETHER YOU WILL
EXIST WITHOUT US.

41:36.990 --> 41:41.723
AND AS AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME ALREADY.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.962
( door slams )

42:04.950 --> 42:10.183
SO THE SHADOW IN THE PICTURE
ISN'T IAN, IT'S YOU?

42:10.220 --> 42:12.154
YEAH.

42:12.190 --> 42:14.954
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US BEFORE?

42:16.100 --> 42:17.727
I DON'T KNOW.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.193
I GUESS THAT
I WAS SCARED.

42:21.230 --> 42:23.790
THIS IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

42:23.840 --> 42:25.637
BUT I THINK THAT
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

42:25.670 --> 42:28.673
BECAUSE THERE WAS
ALWAYS A PART OF ME

42:28.710 --> 42:31.076
THAT WONDERED
IF IT WAS MY FAULT.

42:31.110 --> 42:34.147
I MEAN, I WISHED IT,
AND THEN IT CAME TRUE.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.148
OH, SPENCE,
YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.910
IT WAS JUST
SOMETHING YOU SAID
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

42:38.950 --> 42:42.989
BESIDES, ALI SAID STUFF
TO US THAT WAS WORSE--
MUCH WORSE--RIGHT?

42:46.130 --> 42:47.279
SPENCE?

42:55.170 --> 42:57.991
OH, MY GOD!

42:58.040 --> 42:59.268
IS THAT...

43:01.940 --> 43:03.737
IT'S JASON.

43:13.890 --> 43:16.814
BEADING IS HARD
ON THE EYES, YOU KNOW?

43:16.860 --> 43:18.680
( cat growls )

43:18.730 --> 43:20.129
OH, DON'T BE STARTLED.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.129
THAT'S JUST MY PET.
WHERE WAS I?

43:23.160 --> 43:25.162
OH, YEAH, THE EYES.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.761
YOU HAVE INTERESTING EYES,
DEAR.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.167
THE EYES ARE THE WINDOW
TO THE SOUL.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.702
NOT TO WORRY, DEAR.
( chuckling )

43:35.740 --> 43:39.198
I DID EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.842
( chuckling )
