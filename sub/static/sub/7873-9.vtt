But, honey, Steve is at that age...

to give him a little knowledge.

Tree huggers, I think.

Well, it's clearwhat must be done.

Soon, my pet.
Soon I will feed you the world.

- Coming.

to implant their liberal agendas.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.392
I've dealt with them before,

- Thankyou for seeing us, Principal Lewis.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.679
My husband is just
a teeny bit concerned...

02:27.780 --> 02:30.214
that Steve may not
be ready for sex education.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.309
That's right. Mywife didn't spend 36 hours
squeezing Steve from her birth canal...

02:34.420 --> 02:36.650
soyou could shove his face
right back in there!

02:36.756 --> 02:40.715
The state requires that he take
sex ed in order to graduate.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.318
Fine. Then instead
ofyour bohemian filth fest...

02:43.429 --> 02:46.887

Um, everything, I guess.
I talk a big game...

03:13.226 --> 03:15.285

very little about sex.

- You don't need to know.

- Well, I guess not, but-

03:24.704 --> 03:27.138
See, ifl tell you about it,
it won't be a mystery.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.708
It'll just be a fact-
an ugly, moist fact...

like an octopus.

squatting on your brain, doyou, Son?

03:35.748 --> 03:38.148

- And that's where babies come from.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.487
How did it go with Steve today?

03:42.589 --> 03:45.752

to come with you?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.329
No. This is a father's job.

Besides, sons have complex relationships
with their mothers.
