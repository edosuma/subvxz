03:51.482 --> 03:53.050
Luke, Rick!

03:53.083 --> 03:54.619
Fire, fire! Luke!

03:54.652 --> 03:57.087
Rick! Fire!

03:58.489 --> 03:59.956
Luke, get up.

04:01.626 --> 04:02.926
Luke!

04:07.265 --> 04:08.466
Shit.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.535
Get the canister!

04:12.103 --> 04:13.104
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:14.372 --> 04:17.974
Spray higher.
Aim higher, Tammy.

05:10.026 --> 05:11.995
<i>It's the Early Bird
Sky Watch.</i>

05:12.028 --> 05:14.399
<i>Yesterday's system that ravaged
towns across the panhandle</i>

05:14.432 --> 05:18.669
<i>will shift east and continue
through today with tornadoes.</i>

05:18.703 --> 05:20.036
Hey.

05:23.039 --> 05:24.542
Time to wake up.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.182
It's 5:00.

05:36.721 --> 05:39.055
Farmers, that's who.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.182
Oh!

08:18.215 --> 08:20.184
You're up early.

08:20.217 --> 08:23.754
Yeah, just meeting a friend
for breakfast.

08:25.523 --> 08:28.359
I know why I look like shit.
What's your reason?

08:28.392 --> 08:32.330
Uh, the storm woke me.

08:32.363 --> 08:33.731
What storm?

08:33.764 --> 08:36.200
Jesus, Mom.
How much did you drink?

08:36.232 --> 08:37.602
Don't make something
out of nothing.

08:37.635 --> 08:39.203
And don't take
the Lord's name.

08:39.236 --> 08:42.607
Besides, I'm allowed a night out
once in a while.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.209
You still got me booked
this afternoon?

08:45.242 --> 08:46.644
Yeah.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.750
I thought you said you were
going out for breakfast.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.352
Uh, yeah, just, um...

08:54.385 --> 08:56.487
Who are you going with
this early anyway?

08:56.520 --> 08:59.223
- Just a guy.
- A guy?

08:59.256 --> 09:03.227
Yeah. You don't know him.
He's from out of town.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.629
Hey!

09:04.662 --> 09:07.231
Have fun.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.806
So these windmills,

09:48.839 --> 09:50.574
how soon you think
you can have 'em up?

09:50.608 --> 09:52.410
As soon as can be,
if the land proves suitable.

09:52.443 --> 09:53.944
And that's
a hundred, right?

09:53.978 --> 09:56.414
At 8K a unit.
Still sound good?

09:56.447 --> 09:59.417
Sounds like an answer
to prayers at that price.

09:59.450 --> 10:00.985
Is everything good?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.687
Over there could be karst.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.722
- You gonna run the GPR?
- Yeah.

10:05.756 --> 10:07.458
Karst? What's that?

10:07.491 --> 10:10.327
What it means is there's
a chance the soil's too soft.

10:10.361 --> 10:12.830
This land hadn't been
plowed in years.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.732
Yeah, this kind of thing
runs deeper.

10:14.765 --> 10:17.468
Could be caves or craters
down there.

10:31.015 --> 10:33.451
Did Tom pay his rent
on the cattle yet?

10:33.484 --> 10:37.221
No. Still waiting
on last month too.

10:38.355 --> 10:42.359
Oh, boy.
What is that barn gonna cost us?

10:42.393 --> 10:43.994
We gonna be able
to cover the mortgage?

10:44.028 --> 10:45.996
I'll move some stuff over
from savings,

10:46.030 --> 10:47.865
then I'll go by Tom's

10:47.898 --> 10:51.736
after I'm finished at the clinic
this morning, see what's what.

10:51.769 --> 10:53.037
I'll be back around noon.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.473
Well, remind him
that we're not a charity.

10:55.506 --> 10:56.907
I will.

10:58.642 --> 11:00.611
And how is it
that a mile down the road,

11:00.644 --> 11:02.480
they got rows of those things?

11:02.513 --> 11:06.650
But this land,
this land's not suitable.

11:06.684 --> 11:08.753
They'll figure it out.

11:08.786 --> 11:12.757
One day our grandchildren are
gonna be running this place.

11:12.790 --> 11:14.391
We don't have grandkids, Tammy.

11:14.425 --> 11:16.026
One day we will.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.496
<i>We expect multiple
rounds of severe storms</i>

11:18.529 --> 11:20.664
<i>and could be dealing with
a tornado outbreak</i>

11:20.698 --> 11:22.500
<i>beginning as early as noon.</i>

11:22.533 --> 11:24.034
<i>We will be providing
live details.</i>

11:24.068 --> 11:25.770
Get that seed in yet?

11:25.803 --> 11:27.538
It'll be done today.

11:46.423 --> 11:48.058
What are you thinking about
today's outlook?

11:48.092 --> 11:51.662
It's a nasty setup.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

11:51.695 --> 11:52.930
And after yesterday?

11:52.963 --> 11:54.532
Come on, Peyton.

11:54.565 --> 11:57.301
Hey, where is my kiss?

11:58.969 --> 12:00.404
I'll call you later, okay?
Have a good day.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.540
You too.
What time are you gonna be home?

12:02.573 --> 12:03.808
I don't know.
It's a weather day.

12:03.841 --> 12:05.442
Yeah, well, same for me too.

12:05.476 --> 12:07.411
I just need to know
what time to tell the sitter.

12:07.444 --> 12:09.413
You figure it out.
You always do.

12:09.446 --> 12:10.581
Really?

12:15.586 --> 12:17.688
Hey, Steve, what's up?

12:17.721 --> 12:20.090
No, no, no, it's fine.

12:20.125 --> 12:23.327
What network was reporting that?

12:24.728 --> 12:27.097
No, they shouldn't be
putting that message out.

12:27.132 --> 12:29.900
Well, because
we don't know that.

12:31.635 --> 12:33.704
Well, I spoke to
the National Weather Service

12:33.737 --> 12:35.472
about 20 minutes ago.

12:37.175 --> 12:39.877
Okay, sounds good.
I'll see you soon.

12:40.744 --> 12:42.880
Oh, my gosh.

12:42.913 --> 12:45.482
Oh, no.
Did it fall out again?

12:47.618 --> 12:50.054
Is that better? Okay.

12:53.158 --> 12:55.492
What are you looking at?

13:05.035 --> 13:08.606
I'm glad to know
the birds know what to do.

13:08.639 --> 13:12.509
What do you do
if a watch is issued?

13:13.911 --> 13:16.647
What if a watch
becomes a warning?

13:20.918 --> 13:22.354
That's right.

13:35.099 --> 13:37.668
You will be okay.

13:39.803 --> 13:42.072
You don't know that.

13:45.542 --> 13:48.045
If you want to talk through this
again, I can stay.

13:48.078 --> 13:52.416
I'll do it...
when I'm ready.

14:02.726 --> 14:04.061
Daniel.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.563
Daniel, come here.

14:08.699 --> 14:09.700
Come here.

14:14.105 --> 14:17.808
You gotta know that
until you're honest,

14:17.841 --> 14:20.544
what we're doing,

14:20.577 --> 14:21.812
this is not real.

14:21.845 --> 14:25.683
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna.

14:25.716 --> 14:27.451
You said that before.

14:31.889 --> 14:32.957
Daniel!

14:32.990 --> 14:34.259
- Oh!
- Sorry.

14:34.292 --> 14:35.592
Daniel?

15:08.025 --> 15:09.593
What happened?

15:09.626 --> 15:10.995
Engine light's on
in the wagon again.

15:11.028 --> 15:14.631
Oh. Jeez, Vicky,
you scared the heck out of me.

15:14.665 --> 15:17.768
I thought maybe somebody
got a finger chopped.

15:22.340 --> 15:25.310
Dirty mitts off.

15:25.343 --> 15:28.012
Seriously, if I have to
say it again, I will quit.

15:28.045 --> 15:29.147
No fucking joke.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.615
Come on, you know I'm playing.

15:31.648 --> 15:32.783
I'll do this.

15:32.816 --> 15:34.551
Okay. Please.

15:37.921 --> 15:39.890
I don't think I can do that.

15:39.923 --> 15:41.159
Do what?

15:41.192 --> 15:42.760
You're not worried about
losing your job?

15:42.793 --> 15:46.030
I'm worried
I'm gonna lose my sanity.

15:46.063 --> 15:48.065
We can get this looked at
this afternoon.

15:48.098 --> 15:49.633
I'll give you a call.

15:49.666 --> 15:52.036
Oh, I was supposed to
bring it in last week,

15:52.069 --> 15:53.637
but the twins had flu.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.639
Kinda told my boss
it'd be ready today.

15:55.672 --> 15:57.808
Now there's gonna be weather.

15:57.841 --> 16:00.677
There's always weather.

16:01.845 --> 16:03.781
Come on, Jess.

16:03.814 --> 16:07.185
Okay, well, if we don't have
to order any parts,

16:07.218 --> 16:09.320
still, mid-afternoon
is the best I can do.

16:09.354 --> 16:12.190
- You're an angel
- We both know that's not true.

16:12.223 --> 16:14.558
- I'll call you later.
- Thanks.

16:16.994 --> 16:18.229
- Greg.
- Yeah?

16:18.263 --> 16:20.697
- We need to prioritize this.
- Really?

16:20.731 --> 16:23.201
I'm gonna go next door
and get us a round of coffees.

16:23.234 --> 16:25.370
All right. Hey, uh...

16:25.403 --> 16:28.106
Put the van back, will ya?

16:33.378 --> 16:34.479
<i>Not just for the hills</i>

16:34.512 --> 16:37.348
<i>because listening
could save your life.</i>

16:37.382 --> 16:38.949
<i>It's important you have
multiple ways</i>

16:38.982 --> 16:40.218
<i>to receive warnings.</i>

16:40.251 --> 16:41.352
<i>Make sure you have
fresh batteries</i>

16:41.386 --> 16:42.953
<i>in your weather radio.</i>

16:42.986 --> 16:45.223
<i>Keep your TV or radio
turned up and tuned in</i>

16:45.256 --> 16:47.091
<i>to your favorite
reliable source.</i>

16:47.125 --> 16:50.594
<i>Listen for those sirens,
but don't rely on them alone.</i>

17:20.757 --> 17:22.160
Madeline?

17:25.896 --> 17:30.868
Where, oh, where
is this little baby hiding?

17:30.901 --> 17:33.138
Sometimes it's a little
tricky to see.

17:33.171 --> 17:34.805
Let's see.

17:36.773 --> 17:39.410
Oh, there. There, there, look.
Look at that.

17:39.444 --> 17:42.012
It's that little head
of that little...

17:42.045 --> 17:44.882
little baby boy or girl.

17:44.915 --> 17:48.018
Have you thought about names
at all?

17:48.051 --> 17:51.156
Um, well, I called for...

17:51.189 --> 17:52.457
About abortion.

17:52.490 --> 17:55.293
Oh, I know you did.
I saw that on your chart.

17:55.326 --> 17:57.462
I also saw that
you're 19 years old.

17:57.495 --> 17:59.796
Do you know that that is
just one year younger

17:59.830 --> 18:01.765
than when I got married?

18:01.798 --> 18:03.434
Now, there are a lot of
good reasons to get married,

18:03.468 --> 18:07.305
but oh, having a baby,
now, that is the best.

18:07.338 --> 18:08.805
Have you and your boyfriend

18:08.839 --> 18:10.707
considered getting
married, honey?

18:13.944 --> 18:15.346
Babies...

18:15.380 --> 18:17.915
Babies are a blessing from God.

18:17.948 --> 18:19.450
Do you know
when I had my little boy,

18:19.484 --> 18:21.051
I didn't even hear him cry?

18:21.084 --> 18:24.455
All I heard was an angel
singing down on me, blessing me.

18:24.489 --> 18:26.191
I have to go.
I have to go.

18:26.224 --> 18:28.058
You have been blessed, honey.

18:28.091 --> 18:29.693
I'm sorry. This baby...

18:30.528 --> 18:33.931
Have this baby. Get married.

18:33.964 --> 18:35.832
Consider adoption!

18:37.834 --> 18:40.070
Oh...

18:40.104 --> 18:41.738
my.

18:48.979 --> 18:51.349
Hey. Boy, that was fast.

18:51.382 --> 18:52.816
It's not a real place.

18:52.849 --> 18:54.352
It's just these people
pretending,

18:54.385 --> 18:56.954
so that they can like
convert you or something.

18:56.987 --> 18:58.356
What?

18:58.389 --> 19:00.891
They showed it to me.

19:02.126 --> 19:03.827
That's not right.

19:03.860 --> 19:07.097
Oh, don't look like that.
Come here.

19:07.131 --> 19:08.999
All right.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.908
What if we got married?

19:20.144 --> 19:22.146
I mean, we really haven't
known each other that long.

19:22.180 --> 19:24.249
But you said
that you loved me.

19:24.282 --> 19:27.552
I said I loved
being with you.

19:27.585 --> 19:29.987
Oh, Maddy, this is all
coming out wrong.

19:30.020 --> 19:31.456
I'm sorry.

19:33.324 --> 19:34.858
Just... You know what?

19:34.891 --> 19:38.862
What are you doing?
I got that for you.

19:38.895 --> 19:39.997
Yeah?

19:40.030 --> 19:41.898
Jesus, Maddy,
that was expensive!

19:43.301 --> 19:45.270
Maddy!

19:45.303 --> 19:47.538
Hey, what are you gonna do?

19:47.572 --> 19:49.173
You just gonna leave?

19:51.041 --> 19:52.310
Shit!

20:10.628 --> 20:12.163
Morning.

20:12.196 --> 20:13.464
Hey, wait, wait.

20:13.498 --> 20:15.799
Back it up there, chiquita.

20:17.468 --> 20:19.570
I want one of those
on every bed.

20:19.604 --> 20:21.439
We're fresh out
of the Spanish version,

20:21.472 --> 20:24.442
so you're gonna have to
translate it for your guest

20:24.475 --> 20:26.477
your own self.

20:27.478 --> 20:29.580
I see everything around here.

20:29.614 --> 20:33.083
No, he's not my guest.
He's my fiancé.

20:44.629 --> 20:47.332
Is he living with you?

20:47.365 --> 20:50.101
Mm-hmm. For a short time.

20:50.134 --> 20:51.935
We're buying a house.

20:51.968 --> 20:54.339
I'm signing the papers today.

20:54.372 --> 20:56.840
Uh, you're working today.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.477
Oh, wait a minute.

20:59.510 --> 21:03.381
So from now
to whenever that is...

21:05.249 --> 21:06.883
that's your weekly.

21:09.387 --> 21:11.622
I've been here over two years.

21:11.656 --> 21:13.624
The rate's always been the same.

21:13.658 --> 21:15.360
One person, one rate.

21:15.393 --> 21:17.094
Two people, different rate.

21:17.128 --> 21:18.862
Capisce?

21:24.302 --> 21:26.504
And one more thing, sweetheart.

21:26.537 --> 21:29.140
I don't want to see
that truckload of spics

21:29.173 --> 21:30.375
out front anymore.

21:30.408 --> 21:32.643
If your boyfriend
wants a ride,

21:32.677 --> 21:35.413
he can wait out by the street
like the rest of 'em.

21:46.424 --> 21:48.393
You know "capisce"
is Italian, right?

21:48.426 --> 21:50.128
Don't you start.

21:50.161 --> 21:51.995
The rattle's fixed.

21:52.028 --> 21:54.030
It's parked out by eight.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.402
Oh, don't worry.
I'll get the door myself.

21:57.435 --> 21:59.470
Attagirl.

22:50.488 --> 22:51.522
Get out.

22:53.224 --> 22:56.092
I said get out, puta!

23:24.388 --> 23:27.758
The next thing is signage
for schools, stores,

23:27.792 --> 23:30.528
gas stations, churches,
anything else you can think of.

23:30.561 --> 23:31.629
This is countywide?

23:31.662 --> 23:32.763
Correct, yeah.

23:32.797 --> 23:34.232
What's the message?

23:34.265 --> 23:36.767
"Tornadoes possible.
Be weather aware."

23:36.801 --> 23:38.636
Kim, do you think
that's strong enough?

23:38.669 --> 23:40.638
- They've gone high risk.
- I'm aware.

23:40.671 --> 23:43.541
We need people to respond
calmly and quickly

23:43.574 --> 23:45.376
in the event
that a warning's issued.

23:45.409 --> 23:47.645
If we shout the sky's falling
one too many times

23:47.678 --> 23:49.113
with nothing happening,

23:49.146 --> 23:51.282
no one will take action
when it does.

23:51.315 --> 23:52.517
Are we gonna go over

23:52.550 --> 23:54.418
the infrastructure
response protocol?

23:54.452 --> 23:56.787
Everybody should know their IRP
responsibilities. I know mine.

23:56.821 --> 23:59.557
Does anyone feel the need
to review?

23:59.590 --> 24:02.293
Okay, let's move on.

24:28.185 --> 24:31.054
He sure is
a cute little guy.

24:32.189 --> 24:34.592
Just a little off the bangs
and the back.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.160
- Not too much.
- Okay.

24:36.193 --> 24:38.162
Exactly how
I usually have it, yeah?

24:38.195 --> 24:40.431
She's real good.
She cuts my hair all the time.

24:41.899 --> 24:44.435
- Hi.
- Can we help you?

24:44.468 --> 24:46.704
Oh, hi, Anita.

24:46.737 --> 24:47.738
- Ana.
- Ana, right.

24:47.772 --> 24:48.873
Isn't that what I said?

24:48.906 --> 24:51.309
Can I use the back
for a sec?

24:51.342 --> 24:54.312
- This won't take five minutes.
- Oh, sure.

24:54.345 --> 24:55.112
Hi.

24:55.146 --> 24:56.614
Thanks again
for meeting me here.

24:56.647 --> 24:57.848
My day's chockablock.

24:57.882 --> 25:01.218
Do you mind?

25:13.631 --> 25:15.866
Aww! Your little lion!

25:15.900 --> 25:17.468
Oh, no!

25:21.772 --> 25:24.642
You might actually
have to pick him up.

25:24.675 --> 25:28.613
What's the matter,
my little guy?

25:28.646 --> 25:30.481
Like I said on the phone,

25:30.514 --> 25:33.217
you're getting a great price
on this one.

25:33.250 --> 25:36.253
Really fantastic.
You got any questions?

25:37.388 --> 25:39.357
Um...

25:39.390 --> 25:40.625
I don't think so.

25:40.658 --> 25:44.128
All that's left to do is sign.

25:45.262 --> 25:48.399
If I could get
your signature here...

25:49.800 --> 25:52.136
and here.

25:55.406 --> 25:56.807
That's it.

25:58.275 --> 25:59.710
It's mine.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.780
As soon as
the deposit check clears.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.415
Oh, you need it now?

26:06.283 --> 26:09.520
Um, I'll go right to the bank.

26:09.553 --> 26:10.655
Do me a favor.

26:10.688 --> 26:12.256
Drop it by my office
this afternoon.

26:12.289 --> 26:14.792
- I won't be here that long.
- Of course.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.661
<i>Time for another
weather update,</i>

26:16.694 --> 26:18.396
<i>and I hope
you're all listening</i>

26:18.429 --> 26:19.930
<i>because we're talking
about the potential</i>

26:19.964 --> 26:21.666
<i>for some very dangerous...</i>

26:21.699 --> 26:24.402
How'd it go?

26:24.435 --> 26:26.937
Commission's barely worth it
on deals that small.

26:26.971 --> 26:30.541
Least I can say I've done
my charity work for the day.

26:58.602 --> 26:59.570
Hey!

27:01.338 --> 27:02.873
Unbelievable.

27:05.009 --> 27:09.313
Hey, it's not a herd of dogs.

27:09.346 --> 27:11.582
If you wanna get 'em over here,
you gotta lure 'em, all right?

27:11.615 --> 27:14.585
Go over there to that barn
and get some of that sweet hay,

27:14.618 --> 27:17.988
get it in the truck,
bring it over here.

27:18.022 --> 27:22.460
Go over to that barn
and get some sweet hay, put it...

27:22.493 --> 27:23.761
Daniel!

27:26.497 --> 27:28.332
Get your ass over here.

27:28.365 --> 27:32.336
I told you to get me hands
that know cattle.

27:32.369 --> 27:33.471
He knows.

27:33.504 --> 27:35.005
He don't know his ass
from his elbow.

27:35.039 --> 27:37.608
He don't speak English either.

27:37.641 --> 27:39.744
- He's a good man.
- I said skilled labor,

27:39.777 --> 27:42.480
not just whatever friends and
family you had laying around.

27:42.513 --> 27:45.916
Inefficient labor
cost me money, Daniel.

27:50.054 --> 27:52.256
I'm not done here.

27:57.061 --> 27:59.029
What time of day
you call this?

27:59.063 --> 28:00.097
Morning?

28:00.132 --> 28:03.033
No. Morning was back when
the barn caught on fire.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.034
What?

28:04.068 --> 28:06.504
Where the hell
were you anyway?

28:06.537 --> 28:08.639
You know what? Forget it.
We'll get into it later.

28:08.672 --> 28:11.509
That new guy?
Worthless as tits on a bull.

28:11.542 --> 28:13.377
What new guy?

28:13.410 --> 28:15.045
What do you mean?
You don't have papers on him?

28:15.079 --> 28:17.414
He's been here for days.

28:18.849 --> 28:21.786
God! You smell like
a distillery too.

28:21.819 --> 28:23.954
I can smell you from here.

28:23.988 --> 28:26.423
I hope she was worth it.

28:31.595 --> 28:33.798
- What's your name, buddy?
- Carlos.

28:33.831 --> 28:34.965
I asked him, not you.

28:34.999 --> 28:37.468
You got a work permit?

28:38.836 --> 28:40.538
I no have here.

28:40.571 --> 28:42.540
Don't worry.
He's a good worker.

28:42.573 --> 28:44.408
I don't care if
he's the Wizard of Oz.

28:44.441 --> 28:46.076
He turns up here again
without papers,

28:46.111 --> 28:49.947
my first call's to ICE,
you understand?

28:49.980 --> 28:52.449
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

28:52.483 --> 28:55.452
Good. Make sure he does.

29:22.513 --> 29:23.881
Found you.

30:47.232 --> 30:48.565
Oh!

30:59.244 --> 31:00.577
Oh, God.

31:04.848 --> 31:06.817
Ow! God...

31:12.723 --> 31:15.459
Why don't you
just call Greg?

31:17.861 --> 31:18.996
Come on.

31:19.029 --> 31:21.832
He's not even
dealer-certified.

31:21.865 --> 31:25.103
After what we paid
in repairs last year,

31:25.136 --> 31:26.737
should've just bought
a new one.

31:26.770 --> 31:29.006
Well, we can't afford a new one,
so what do you wanna do?

31:29.039 --> 31:31.242
You wanna take out
a new line of credit?

31:31.276 --> 31:32.843
No.

31:32.876 --> 31:34.578
Okay.

31:34.611 --> 31:36.714
Well, then you call Greg,
tell him to fix it.

31:36.747 --> 31:39.717
If you don't want to do that,
then you rent one.

31:39.750 --> 31:41.585
The important thing
is that we get that seed

31:41.618 --> 31:43.854
into the ground.

31:43.887 --> 31:45.256
Renting's not cheap either.

31:45.290 --> 31:49.493
All right, honey,
what do you want to do?

31:55.032 --> 31:56.633
Damn.

32:01.905 --> 32:03.208
Mr. Mechanico!

32:04.775 --> 32:07.145
You, Mr. Mechanico.

32:07.178 --> 32:09.079
Yeah, you.

32:13.784 --> 32:15.019
Mira.

32:15.052 --> 32:16.620
It's broken.

32:16.653 --> 32:18.189
Take a look.

32:25.062 --> 32:26.030
Hmm...

32:52.990 --> 32:55.659
Greg? Yeah, Rick.

32:55.692 --> 32:57.661
Yes, again.

32:57.694 --> 33:00.798
Uh, listen, I've got...
I've got labor here.

33:00.831 --> 33:05.103
Um, think you could just
sell me some parts?

33:07.405 --> 33:09.207
All right.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.143
Uh, nosotros.

33:13.744 --> 33:15.146
Okay, uh...

33:16.114 --> 33:18.116
Go here.

33:18.982 --> 33:21.152
Get the piezas here.

33:22.153 --> 33:23.954
- El motél.
- ¡Sì!

33:25.123 --> 33:26.090
- All right.
- Bueno.

33:26.124 --> 33:28.259
Okay, good. Adios.

35:00.218 --> 35:02.320
Planning on fixing those nails?

35:02.353 --> 35:04.322
I'm just saying.

35:04.355 --> 35:07.791
It's tacky, and people judge.

35:12.095 --> 35:13.697
Tor watch.

35:17.834 --> 35:21.472
Maddy, is that
what's bothering you?

35:21.506 --> 35:24.074
Or is it something else?

35:24.108 --> 35:25.976
Ah, it's...

35:26.009 --> 35:28.112
Thinking about
my life path, that's all.

35:28.146 --> 35:32.082
You're going to Tulsa
to study cosmetology.

35:32.116 --> 35:34.219
Don't tell me
you're changing your mind

35:34.252 --> 35:36.354
after all the work
you put into it.

35:36.387 --> 35:37.854
The saving.

35:42.393 --> 35:44.295
I'm pregnant.

35:55.139 --> 35:56.407
Stop.

35:57.442 --> 35:59.009
Maddy, please. Stop.

36:01.878 --> 36:05.116
Do you know
how far along you are?

36:05.149 --> 36:08.419
I don't know, like...
seven, eight weeks.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.858
Oh. Here.

36:14.891 --> 36:16.160
Sit down.

36:16.194 --> 36:17.894
Mom, I...

36:20.030 --> 36:21.765
Here.

36:29.039 --> 36:30.441
Who's the father?

36:32.310 --> 36:36.281
Just this guy
from Prairie Rock.

36:36.314 --> 36:39.550
Is it a relationship?

36:39.584 --> 36:42.052
Well, he wants me to,
you know, um...

36:43.920 --> 36:46.324
He wants me not to have it.

36:46.357 --> 36:48.925
And what do you want?

36:50.328 --> 36:52.029
I...

36:52.062 --> 36:54.931
I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

36:56.334 --> 36:58.569
Well, I know you're not
asking my opinion,

36:58.603 --> 37:03.441
but you shouldn't feel pressure
either way,

37:03.474 --> 37:05.809
not from anyone.

37:07.944 --> 37:12.049
You don't have to do anything.

37:12.082 --> 37:15.186
By that, I mean...

37:15.219 --> 37:17.322
it's your body.

37:17.355 --> 37:19.190
Your life.

37:19.223 --> 37:23.960
So do you want to have
a baby right now?

37:23.994 --> 37:25.596
How do I answer that?

37:25.630 --> 37:28.366
I mean, how do you decide?

37:28.399 --> 37:30.967
Are you prepared
to raise a child?

37:33.638 --> 37:36.107
People say that
abortion is murder.

37:38.376 --> 37:39.843
Yeah.

37:40.645 --> 37:42.213
I know those people.

37:42.246 --> 37:45.216
They are pro-life
when the baby's on the inside.

37:45.249 --> 37:48.519
The minute it's out,
it's a burden to society.

37:51.988 --> 37:54.625
I had you pretty young,
you know that.

37:54.659 --> 37:58.095
And I love you more than
anything in the world,

37:58.129 --> 38:00.097
but...

38:00.131 --> 38:03.234
you kinda ruined my life.

38:03.267 --> 38:06.637
You are the best...

38:06.671 --> 38:10.508
and most challenging thing
that ever happened to me,

38:10.541 --> 38:14.545
but you need to know
that raising a child

38:14.579 --> 38:18.249
is 24-7-365 forever,

38:18.282 --> 38:21.652
and it is not easy.

38:21.686 --> 38:25.390
Emotionally, financially,
in every way.

38:25.423 --> 38:27.125
It's just...

38:27.158 --> 38:30.128
I love you, but...

38:30.161 --> 38:32.430
there's reason
you're an only child.

38:33.431 --> 38:35.666
What about God?

38:35.700 --> 38:38.569
God gave us a choice.

38:41.572 --> 38:44.709
And I can't make this one
for you.

38:44.742 --> 38:50.181
But I will be here
no matter what you decide.

38:58.322 --> 39:00.558
Okay, here we go.

39:00.591 --> 39:04.562
Two BLTs and a tuna wrap.

39:04.595 --> 39:07.698
You're not upsetting
my staff, are you?

39:07.732 --> 39:12.603
Oh, no, just a...
mother-daughter moment.

39:14.205 --> 39:16.340
How long has this
been sitting?

39:16.374 --> 39:19.177
You gotta use it straight away,
or it'll affect the shade.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.179
Okay.

39:21.212 --> 39:22.447
Oh, it's...

39:22.480 --> 39:25.216
School closures.
The whole county.

39:29.487 --> 39:31.122
It's Kim.

39:33.491 --> 39:35.726
- Hi, Kim.
- <i>Hey.</i>

39:35.760 --> 39:37.195
I'm sorry to bother you,

39:37.228 --> 39:39.197
but is there any way
you can go get her?

39:39.230 --> 39:43.468
Yeah, um, I need to pick
Peyton up from school.

39:43.501 --> 39:45.736
You go on.
I can finish this.

39:45.770 --> 39:47.605
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

39:47.638 --> 39:50.208
Yeah, no, yeah,
I can be there.

39:50.241 --> 39:51.742
<i>I wish I could
get there myself,</i>

39:51.776 --> 39:53.211
but my hands are tied.

39:53.244 --> 39:54.479
Of course.

39:54.512 --> 39:56.614
I can be there in five.

39:56.647 --> 39:58.783
Hey, hey, give your mother
a kiss.

39:58.816 --> 40:01.152
Can you just hang on
for a sec? Thanks.

40:04.522 --> 40:06.657
I love you, baby girl.

40:12.797 --> 40:14.665
<i>Do you feel comfortable
with this?</i>

40:14.699 --> 40:17.268
- It's fine.
- <i>You're okay?</i>

40:17.301 --> 40:19.237
You know the family plan
is on the fridge.

40:19.270 --> 40:21.239
You know the pillows
and the blankets...

40:21.272 --> 40:22.373
<i>In the hall closet.</i>

40:22.406 --> 40:24.108
I know. Don't worry.

40:24.141 --> 40:25.510
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:25.543 --> 40:27.512
Yeah, of course.
I'll see you later.

40:27.545 --> 40:30.381
Okay. Bye.

40:30.414 --> 40:33.117
Hey, if you gotta be at home
with your kid,

40:33.150 --> 40:35.119
doing like mom things,
then you should go.

40:35.152 --> 40:36.153
We can handle it.

40:37.421 --> 40:40.691
What I need is real-time info
as storms fire.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.161
Great.

40:48.299 --> 40:49.200
- Kim?
- Huh?

40:49.233 --> 40:51.569
- You ready?
- I'll be there in a sec.

40:51.602 --> 40:53.271
<i>Now it is early,</i>

40:53.304 --> 40:54.839
<i>but this outbreak's
already underway.</i>

40:54.872 --> 40:56.807
<i>The tornado's being reported
off to the west,</i>

40:56.841 --> 40:58.009
<i>near the state line.</i>

40:58.041 --> 40:59.810
<i>Storms will reach our counties
around the metro</i>

40:59.844 --> 41:01.412
<i>in just a few hours,</i>

41:01.445 --> 41:03.881
<i>during the most volatile part
of the day.</i>

41:07.752 --> 41:09.587
- All right.
- Thanks.

41:11.722 --> 41:13.591
I got it. Thanks.

41:17.194 --> 41:18.729
All right, don't.
It'll rustle.

41:19.897 --> 41:22.433
All right.

41:22.466 --> 41:25.169
All right, here we go.

41:25.202 --> 41:26.604
Five, four...

41:28.873 --> 41:31.442
<i>Now I have online
the regional emergency manager</i>

41:31.475 --> 41:32.710
<i>from Ethel County.</i>

41:32.743 --> 41:34.211
A very beautiful woman.
I can say that

41:34.245 --> 41:36.314
'cause she happens to be
my wife, Kimberly Jones.

41:36.347 --> 41:37.448
Hello, Kim, you there?

41:37.481 --> 41:39.317
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Brad.

41:39.350 --> 41:40.851
<i>Kim, today's a day
to be vigilant.</i>

41:40.885 --> 41:43.854
Tornado warnings are
just outside our viewing area,

41:43.888 --> 41:45.489
but we're under a PDS

41:45.523 --> 41:48.726
or "particularly dangerous
situation" tornado watch.

41:48.759 --> 41:49.894
<i>What does that mean
for you folks</i>

41:49.927 --> 41:52.229
<i>over at Emergency Management?</i>

41:52.263 --> 41:56.334
Well, for us it means people
need to be aware and prepared.

41:56.367 --> 41:58.202
But shouldn't people
be worried?

41:58.235 --> 42:00.605
No. Prepared is what
people need to be.

42:00.638 --> 42:02.607
Know where your safe place is,

42:02.640 --> 42:04.609
have everything you need
on hand

42:04.642 --> 42:05.876
because if the sirens go off,

42:05.910 --> 42:07.745
you will not have time
to go searching.

42:07.778 --> 42:10.214
Now, severe weather
is pretty common,

42:10.247 --> 42:12.216
but what about school closures?

42:12.249 --> 42:14.619
Well, the potential today
is heightened.

42:14.652 --> 42:15.886
Nothing's a sure thing,

42:15.920 --> 42:18.789
but the ingredients
are coming together.

42:18.823 --> 42:20.358
A PDS watch means

42:20.391 --> 42:23.227
a potential for numerous
destructive tornadoes.

42:23.260 --> 42:25.363
An outbreak.

42:53.557 --> 42:55.159
Hey!

42:56.427 --> 42:57.795
Hey!

42:57.828 --> 42:59.697
Your mom is
a very important lady,

42:59.730 --> 43:02.199
so you get me early.

43:03.701 --> 43:05.302
What's wrong?

43:14.578 --> 43:15.813
Oh.

43:15.846 --> 43:18.816
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh.

43:18.849 --> 43:20.317
What happened?

43:25.456 --> 43:28.292
Oh, no, no, no.

43:28.325 --> 43:29.293
Don't be silly.

43:29.326 --> 43:31.429
She is gonna understand.

43:31.462 --> 43:33.831
Hey, ye... Hey, yeah.

43:33.864 --> 43:37.001
We will talk to her, okay?
Together.

43:37.034 --> 43:41.739
When she gets home, okay?

43:41.772 --> 43:43.307
Okay.

43:43.340 --> 43:45.009
Hey.

43:45.042 --> 43:49.313
What's gonna make this better?

43:49.346 --> 43:51.315
Ice cream?

43:52.349 --> 43:53.751
Or cookies?

44:11.769 --> 44:14.338
<i>Seriously, lame city.</i>

44:14.371 --> 44:15.740
<i>Lame-o-tropolis.</i>

44:15.773 --> 44:17.341
<i>Lame-donia.</i>

44:17.374 --> 44:19.343
- <i>Lame...</i>
- <i>Well, well, well.</i>

44:19.376 --> 44:22.646
<i>Oh! Ha ha!
I wasn't talking about you.</i>

45:04.955 --> 45:06.524
<i>You saved my life!</i>

45:06.557 --> 45:08.425
<i>Did you hear what he said?</i>

45:08.459 --> 45:11.796
<i>Yeah. I cannot be alone
with that guy ever.</i>

45:11.829 --> 45:13.531
<i>He called me your girlfriend!</i>

45:13.564 --> 45:15.966
<i>That's silly.
That's just ridiculous, right?</i>

45:16.000 --> 45:17.968
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

45:19.137 --> 45:21.539
<i>What were you doing
in my shower?</i>

45:44.461 --> 45:46.430
Next load's coming in 20.

45:46.463 --> 45:49.333
Why don't you handle that one?

45:54.605 --> 45:56.841
You know what? Fine.

45:56.874 --> 45:58.475
Hundreds more
where you came from.

45:58.509 --> 46:00.145
Don't do that.

46:00.178 --> 46:04.014
It's not you,
but it is offensive.

46:08.886 --> 46:10.855
You know what I think's
offensive

46:10.888 --> 46:12.990
is people sneaking
into this country,

46:13.023 --> 46:16.127
taking jobs from
taxpaying citizens.

46:16.161 --> 46:19.997
Okay. This is what
you want to talk about?

46:20.030 --> 46:24.602
You got guys working 14,
16 hours a day for minimum wage.

46:24.635 --> 46:25.870
You pay in cash.

46:25.903 --> 46:27.605
Nobody's forcing them
to be here.

46:27.638 --> 46:29.907
But if they say no,

46:29.940 --> 46:32.643
hundreds more
where they came from, hmm?

47:05.676 --> 47:08.679
I don't know that I could be
who you want.

47:10.547 --> 47:13.417
There it is.
That's your answer.

47:17.688 --> 47:19.957
Do you want to live a lie
forever?

47:21.226 --> 47:23.560
I won't.

47:52.723 --> 47:55.693
All right, if I can just
get your autograph.

47:55.726 --> 47:58.862
Oh, um, no, no. Señor...

47:58.896 --> 48:00.965
Mr. Rick, he pay.

48:00.998 --> 48:03.567
Yes. I'm not
asking you to pay.

48:03.600 --> 48:06.603
I need you to sign
to claim receipt.

48:10.607 --> 48:11.709
Okay.

48:11.742 --> 48:16.114
See, this list says...

48:16.147 --> 48:19.117
what's in the box.

48:19.150 --> 48:21.119
I need you to sign...

48:21.152 --> 48:25.856
to say I gave you the parts...

48:25.889 --> 48:28.892
in the box.

48:28.926 --> 48:31.196
You need to sign.

48:32.930 --> 48:34.598
My name.

48:34.631 --> 48:37.034
Yeah. Right there.

48:46.344 --> 48:47.644
Excellent.

48:51.949 --> 48:53.517
Thank you.

48:56.920 --> 48:59.290
Ah, yeah. Big storm coming.

48:59.324 --> 49:00.891
You don't wanna
get stuck out there.

49:00.924 --> 49:02.626
Are you headed straight back?

49:02.659 --> 49:03.894
Thank you.

49:03.927 --> 49:05.629
Drive safe.

49:05.662 --> 49:07.198
Goodbye.

49:11.202 --> 49:12.903
Thank you.

49:12.936 --> 49:14.205
Pleasure.

49:17.074 --> 49:19.177
Hey.

49:19.210 --> 49:21.645
You are in luck
'cause it's all fixed.

49:21.678 --> 49:24.215
Genius. Thank you.

49:25.682 --> 49:27.318
<i>I'm getting
increasingly concerned</i>

49:27.352 --> 49:29.920
<i>about this developing supercell
southwest of metro.</i>

49:29.953 --> 49:31.922
<i>Now, I want to remind folks

49:31.955 --> 49:34.925
<i>if a tornado warning

<i>In this four-disc series,</i>

49:48.972 --> 49:51.276
<i>we're going to learn
basic words.</i>

50:02.387 --> 50:04.088
Maddy? Hey, it's me.

50:09.993 --> 50:11.129
Come on.

50:13.730 --> 50:15.266
Okay, um...

50:15.300 --> 50:18.236
I have to talk...

50:18.269 --> 50:21.705
with my friend outside, okay?

50:21.738 --> 50:25.410
If you need me,
I'm out there, okay?

50:25.443 --> 50:26.643
Okay.

50:28.179 --> 50:29.713
You can't be here.

50:29.746 --> 50:31.715
What, are you just
ignoring me?

50:31.748 --> 50:34.252
No, I'm not ignoring you.
I can't talk to you right now.

50:34.285 --> 50:36.987
I can't have this
hanging over me.

50:37.020 --> 50:39.591
Can we just talk?

50:43.161 --> 50:45.729
- Like two minutes.
- Yeah.

50:45.762 --> 50:47.731
- That's it.
- Okay.

50:47.764 --> 50:48.899
Okay.

51:01.812 --> 51:05.150
Look, all I want to say
is that if you want to have it,

51:05.183 --> 51:07.152
you should have it.

51:07.185 --> 51:11.289
But I don't want to meet it
or see it or be involved.

51:11.322 --> 51:13.023
I wouldn't want you to be.

51:13.056 --> 51:14.925
This morning,
you wanted to get married.

51:14.958 --> 51:16.760
No, don't worry.

51:16.793 --> 51:18.363
I don't.

51:19.796 --> 51:21.432
Look, this isn't
gonna be easy.

51:21.466 --> 51:24.668
And how the hell
would you know that?

51:31.342 --> 51:33.211
I have two already.

51:37.215 --> 51:39.184
This wasn't supposed to happen.

51:39.217 --> 51:40.918
So you have a wife too?

51:40.951 --> 51:44.688
- Maddy, please.
- No, don't, don't touch me!

51:47.492 --> 51:49.460
So you're not getting
any signal from Currents?

51:49.494 --> 51:51.496
The west side, no, but I'm
trying to contact the east.

51:51.529 --> 51:53.198
It shows that my messages
are being received.

51:53.231 --> 51:54.465
Do you have the alerts
going out?

51:54.499 --> 51:56.201
To Calumet, yes.
I'm trying my best.

51:56.234 --> 51:59.337
SBC's gotten a dozen
tornado reports and counting.

51:59.370 --> 52:01.472
Sounds like the worst of it's
out by Coopertown.

52:01.506 --> 52:02.940
Extensive damage.

52:02.973 --> 52:06.710
Large and violent
near Hinckley and Atherton.

52:42.413 --> 52:44.382
Discovered one
in the morning.

52:44.415 --> 52:45.882
Oh, yeah?

52:47.118 --> 52:50.521
What's this drain work?
I didn't see any receipt for it.

52:50.555 --> 52:52.856
Let's not pay it.
Hi, baby.

52:52.889 --> 52:54.992
Well, I gave you everything
that was in the folder.

52:55.025 --> 52:56.994
How are you?

52:57.027 --> 52:58.529
Don't worry about this, baby.
We're gonna get through it.

52:58.563 --> 52:59.997
We always do get through it,

53:00.030 --> 53:02.433
and we're gonna
get through it again, right?

53:02.467 --> 53:07.538
Yeah. This one... Look.
I can't even read that.

53:07.572 --> 53:10.275
- It's the feed store.
- Oh, that's...

53:10.308 --> 53:13.278
They don't write
in English, mister.

53:13.311 --> 53:15.313
Okay.

53:18.583 --> 53:21.885
Luke, what is up
with the sad face?

53:21.918 --> 53:23.053
I'm gay.

53:24.489 --> 53:26.357
What'd you say?

53:27.924 --> 53:29.460
I'm sorry.

53:36.601 --> 53:38.902
Just 'cause you can't
keep a girlfriend...

53:38.935 --> 53:41.071
I'm gay.

53:47.345 --> 53:49.314
I've tried to be
what you wanted. I...

53:49.347 --> 53:52.916
Hard-working, patriotic,

53:52.949 --> 53:54.951
Christian.

53:54.985 --> 53:56.820
Those things?

54:01.225 --> 54:04.462
The purpose
of a man and a woman

54:04.495 --> 54:07.465
is to get married
and make babies.

54:07.498 --> 54:11.068
Anything else transcends
the laws of nature.

54:11.102 --> 54:12.969
Tammy, I'm...

54:15.373 --> 54:16.973
You're not gay!

54:40.665 --> 54:41.632
<i>Hi, this is Maddy.</i>

54:41.666 --> 54:42.633
<i>Sorry I missed you...</i>

54:42.667 --> 54:44.635
Kim, do you have a minute?

54:44.669 --> 54:46.504
<i>I will call you back.</i>

54:46.537 --> 54:48.673
Maddy, I need to know
you guys are home.

54:48.706 --> 54:50.040
Please call me.

54:52.143 --> 54:54.512
Do have any further information
on a specific location?

54:54.545 --> 54:57.248
Sorry.

54:57.281 --> 54:59.150
Yes?

55:01.152 --> 55:02.587
Got it. Thank you.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.428
It's us.

55:25.309 --> 55:27.678
<i>A tornado warning

<i>Ethel, Caddo...</i>

55:31.315 --> 55:32.583

55:32.617 --> 55:34.552
I've been living here
55 years.

55:34.585 --> 55:37.288
I know the difference between
a tornado warning

55:37.321 --> 55:39.055
and a waste-of-time warning.

55:39.089 --> 55:40.691
I'm going outside
to put up some equipment

55:40.725 --> 55:43.428

beat all to hell.

55:48.466 --> 55:50.201
Mom.

55:51.636 --> 55:53.036
Mom, what are you doing?

55:53.069 --> 55:54.472
I'm getting the house ready.

55:54.505 --> 55:56.307
<i>A tornado warning

<i>If you're listening at home,
what I want you to do</i>

56:14.625 --> 56:16.594
<i>is go to the lowest floor
possible.</i>

56:16.627 --> 56:18.729
<i>Find a room in
the center of the house,</i>

56:18.763 --> 56:22.733
<i>ideally an interior
bathroom or closet.</i>

56:22.767 --> 56:24.602
<i>Wrap yourself up

<i>to protect yourself

56:26.237 --> 56:27.738
<i>Don't waste time
opening up windows</i>

56:27.772 --> 56:29.474
<i>like they told you to do
in the '60s.</i>

56:29.507 --> 56:31.342
<i>Tornadoes will do that for you.</i>

56:31.375 --> 56:32.610
If you're on the road,

56:32.643 --> 56:34.745
now's the time
to get to a sturdy building.

56:34.779 --> 56:37.248
If you can't find one,
get in a ditch.

56:37.281 --> 56:40.218
Do not... I repeat...
do not seek shelter

56:40.251 --> 56:41.686
under an overpass.

56:41.719 --> 56:45.122
<i>I'll tell you, this is an HP
high-precipitation supercell.</i>

56:45.156 --> 56:48.226
<i>If this thing's on the ground,
it's gonna be rain-wrapped,</i>

56:48.259 --> 56:50.228
<i>so don't be caught out there
trying to get a view.</i>

56:50.261 --> 56:52.263
<i>You're not gonna see it
till it's on you.</i>

56:54.532 --> 56:56.667
Go, go, go.

57:01.405 --> 57:03.508
<i>If you're not in a safe place,</i>

57:03.541 --> 57:05.543
<i>you need to get there now.</i>

57:07.578 --> 57:09.647
This doesn't have
to be a thing.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.115
And what does that mean?

57:11.148 --> 57:13.384
I can't afford
another kid, Maddy.

57:13.417 --> 57:15.119
Kids are expensive.

57:15.152 --> 57:17.255
But yeah, if you choose
to have it, I'd do my best.

57:17.288 --> 57:18.789
But you gotta understand,

57:18.823 --> 57:21.125
I don't have a lot of money,
all right? I just don't.

57:21.158 --> 57:22.793
<i>To my friends in Minninnewah...</i>

57:22.827 --> 57:24.395
What are you going to do?

57:25.696 --> 57:27.798
You can't leave me
hanging like this.

57:27.832 --> 57:30.301
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know!

57:30.334 --> 57:31.569
- Maddy...
- Stop.

57:31.602 --> 57:32.803
<i>And this is the I-40.</i>

57:32.837 --> 57:35.139
You need to leave.

57:35.172 --> 57:37.408
<i>This thing's basically
riding the interstate, folks.</i>

57:52.456 --> 57:53.558
Stay here.

57:58.729 --> 58:00.598
Hey, hey.

58:08.372 --> 58:11.309
Tornado! Tornado!

58:11.342 --> 58:13.444
Everybody out! Tornado!

58:15.613 --> 58:16.847
Tornado!

58:20.885 --> 58:22.186
Tornado!

58:22.219 --> 58:23.354
Follow me!

58:29.360 --> 58:32.330
- Follow me!
- Hey, where is the manager?

58:42.907 --> 58:44.241
Come on!

58:48.245 --> 58:49.780
Get in!

58:50.648 --> 58:52.483
Mom! Mom!

58:52.516 --> 58:54.118
Mom!

58:54.919 --> 58:56.387
Come here!

58:57.521 --> 58:59.123
Dad! Dad!

59:01.258 --> 59:02.393
Dad!

59:04.395 --> 59:06.364
Dad!

59:06.397 --> 59:07.665
Dad!

59:31.555 --> 59:34.425
Wait! Wait, wait.

59:47.571 --> 59:49.407
<i>How are you?</i>

59:49.440 --> 59:52.309
<i>How... are... you?</i>

59:53.310 --> 59:56.714
<i>En repuesta, puede decir.</i>

59:56.747 --> 01:00:00.418
<i>I... am... fine.</i>

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.976
- I've never seen it like this.
- Shh! Stop it.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.345
You're gonna scare them.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.315
Hey, calm down.

01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:33.718
Everything is gonna be
all right, okay?

01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:44.895
Calm down.

01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:59.610
It's insane out there.
Hail's smashing everything up.

01:00:59.643 --> 01:01:00.878
They say it hit Big Heart.

01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:02.747
- The casino?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:08.352
You sure this is
the safest place to be?

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:10.287
Oh, my God!

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:14.525
What?

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.629
- Get your cart.
- My cart?

01:01:18.662 --> 01:01:20.030
Yes, and go to the kitchen.

01:01:20.064 --> 01:01:23.033
Yes! Go! Now! Fast!

01:01:23.067 --> 01:01:25.369
Everybody listen, please.

01:01:26.804 --> 01:01:28.372
Follow me. This way.

01:01:28.405 --> 01:01:30.407
Everybody come.

01:01:34.545 --> 01:01:36.647
Stay back from the windows!
Back, back, back!

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.315
Keep them coming. Come on.

01:01:50.861 --> 01:01:52.396
Here.

01:01:52.429 --> 01:01:53.330
Everybody in.

01:02:27.731 --> 01:02:30.434
It won't lock.
It won't lock!

01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:32.703
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait.
- What is it?

01:02:32.736 --> 01:02:34.038
Watch out, watch out.

01:02:35.873 --> 01:02:37.708
Hold on. I gotta tie it.

01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:39.577
It should be closing.
Come on.

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:41.011
Hold it.

01:02:45.883 --> 01:02:46.851
You got it.

01:02:46.884 --> 01:02:48.853
- Okay, hold on.
- Okay.

01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:50.487
All right.

01:02:55.759 --> 01:02:58.729
<i>A tornado emergency
for the town of Minninnewah</i>

01:02:58.762 --> 01:02:59.897
<i>and points northeast.</i>

01:03:02.766 --> 01:03:05.603
<i>Folks, this is a
one-in-a-thousand type warning.</i>

01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:01.986
Kim!

01:05:02.019 --> 01:05:04.488
Kim, come on!

01:05:23.907 --> 01:05:25.143
Peyton!

01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:27.077
There's no time, okay?

01:05:39.923 --> 01:05:41.658
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

01:05:55.939 --> 01:05:58.075
- Ana!
- Shh!

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:34.232
Maddy!

01:08:36.134 --> 01:08:37.701
Peyton!

01:08:58.122 --> 01:09:02.493
Still waiting for pictures.
KWBD has a crew en route.

01:09:02.527 --> 01:09:05.263
Okay, here we go, folks.
First shots are coming through.

01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:07.232
And, uh, what are we
looking at here?

01:09:07.265 --> 01:09:09.234
Is this Prairie Rock?

01:09:09.267 --> 01:09:11.536
Is that confirmed?

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:17.508
Okay, these pictures just
coming through now of, uh...

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:20.111
It looks like... Holy...

01:09:20.144 --> 01:09:21.877
It's not a lot.

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:24.848
That looks like
Big Heart Casino.

01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:26.850
I mean, these fields
out here, folks,

01:09:26.883 --> 01:09:30.388
you can see where the tornado
just cut across.

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:32.990
Did you hear anything
from my wife?

01:09:33.023 --> 01:09:36.127
Okay, if you're from, uh,
if you're in Minninnewah,

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.395
the storm has passed.

01:09:37.428 --> 01:09:40.398
The structures are unsound
and, uh...

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:44.269
Peter, just give me a signal
when you get her, okay?

01:09:44.301 --> 01:09:46.537
I want you to stay away
from water, okay?

01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:49.274
If you could safely get to
circuit boards to shut them off,

01:09:49.307 --> 01:09:50.541
that would be great.

01:09:50.575 --> 01:09:54.345
You could turn off,
uh, gas lines and...

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.283
Look, folks, I'm gonna ask
Ashlynn to step in here for me.

01:09:58.316 --> 01:10:00.418
I'm gonna hand over
coverage to her.

01:10:00.451 --> 01:10:02.786
She'll get you through this,
all right?

01:10:05.623 --> 01:10:07.592
- Did you get her?
- There's no cell service.

01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.294
Regional Emergency
Management teams

01:10:09.327 --> 01:10:10.461
will be setting up
relief centers

01:10:10.495 --> 01:10:12.597
at the following locations.

01:10:19.337 --> 01:10:21.938
Daniel, Daniel!

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.156
Ana!

01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:19.590
Ana!

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:54.017
Ana!

01:14:00.424 --> 01:14:02.025
Ana!

01:14:05.429 --> 01:14:07.298
Someone help.

01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:13.571
Help me.

01:14:16.574 --> 01:14:18.041
Ana!

01:14:24.181 --> 01:14:25.316
Ana!

01:14:30.354 --> 01:14:32.055
Ana.

01:14:45.336 --> 01:14:47.204
Oh, man.

01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:53.210
Hold still.

01:14:53.244 --> 01:14:54.478
Put that on there.

01:14:54.512 --> 01:14:56.213
I know, I know, I know.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.455
Help!

01:15:04.488 --> 01:15:06.357
Ah, jeez!

01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:10.628
Oh, shit.

01:15:31.549 --> 01:15:34.118
Oh, my God.

01:15:35.519 --> 01:15:38.255
Oh, my God.

01:15:39.523 --> 01:15:41.258
Holy shit.

01:15:42.393 --> 01:15:44.629
Do you smell gas?

01:15:47.665 --> 01:15:49.266
Hold up.

01:15:50.534 --> 01:15:51.769
Everyone, we have to go.

01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:55.706
We have to go right now.
Come on, let's go.

01:16:16.727 --> 01:16:18.195
Jess?

01:16:19.697 --> 01:16:21.832
Have to find Maddy.

01:16:51.328 --> 01:16:54.865
I know how hard this is,
but this is our job.

01:16:54.899 --> 01:16:57.201
This is what we signed up for.

01:16:59.336 --> 01:17:02.873
We've got a whole town
counting on us.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.358
Come on.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.291
Mom.

01:17:58.929 --> 01:18:00.531
Are you okay?

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.802
Mom.

01:18:08.539 --> 01:18:10.307
Come on, Mom.

01:18:28.559 --> 01:18:29.560
Luke!

01:18:29.593 --> 01:18:31.428
Rick!

01:18:32.696 --> 01:18:34.064
Rick?

01:18:34.098 --> 01:18:35.299
Dad!

01:18:36.867 --> 01:18:39.537
Rick, Rick!

01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:41.672
Dad, Dad!

01:18:41.705 --> 01:18:43.574
Dad!

01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:48.546
Dad.

01:18:48.579 --> 01:18:50.815
Dad, can you hear me?

01:18:50.848 --> 01:18:52.850
Is he breathing?

01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:55.419
Right here, right here.

01:18:55.452 --> 01:18:57.555
No, no, that's too low,
that's too low.

01:18:57.588 --> 01:18:58.722
Do the breathing.

01:18:58.756 --> 01:19:00.691
Rick, come on, baby.

01:19:00.724 --> 01:19:03.427
One, two, three, four.
Wait.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.595
Wait till thirty.

01:19:04.628 --> 01:19:05.963
One, two, three, four...

01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:08.699
- Help!
- Six, seven, eight, nine...

01:19:08.732 --> 01:19:09.834
Daniel!

01:19:09.867 --> 01:19:11.702
Breathe two times.
Big, hon.

01:19:11.735 --> 01:19:13.971
One, two... No more.

01:19:14.004 --> 01:19:15.472
Three, four...

01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:18.562
Oh!

01:21:18.595 --> 01:21:19.997
Oh, my God.

01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:25.736
Ay, mi amor.

01:21:28.605 --> 01:21:30.241
Ay. Shh...

01:21:30.275 --> 01:21:32.710
Come here.

01:21:50.761 --> 01:21:51.996
Hey.

01:21:52.029 --> 01:21:53.998
Wake up!

01:21:54.031 --> 01:21:56.000
Come on, wake up!

01:22:00.305 --> 01:22:01.905
Help!

01:22:01.939 --> 01:22:03.741
Hey!

01:22:03.774 --> 01:22:05.542
Over here! I need help!

01:22:11.081 --> 01:22:13.017
- Be careful.
- Come on!

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.084
Be careful.

01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:22.059
Hey.

01:22:33.804 --> 01:22:35.672
Vicky! Vicky!

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.642
Jess, stay back.

01:22:38.675 --> 01:22:39.910
What is it?

01:22:39.943 --> 01:22:40.911
No, Jess, don't!

01:22:40.944 --> 01:22:43.314
Do not come any closer!

01:22:43.348 --> 01:22:44.915
Vicki, what? Let me help!

01:22:44.948 --> 01:22:46.083
Please don't!

01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:54.825
No! No!

01:23:01.965 --> 01:23:04.068
Jess, don't. I have this.

01:23:04.102 --> 01:23:06.670
- Jess, I don't want you to see.
- No.

01:23:06.703 --> 01:23:09.073
Get her out.
Get her out!

01:23:18.048 --> 01:23:19.683
- I won't...
- Careful.

01:23:19.716 --> 01:23:21.119
Watch it.

01:23:22.287 --> 01:23:23.987
Hey, can you help us?

01:23:24.021 --> 01:23:25.256
My daughter's under here.
Please.

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:33.630
Careful.

01:23:35.133 --> 01:23:36.600
Maddy!

01:23:40.737 --> 01:23:42.140
Okay, watch it.

01:23:45.909 --> 01:23:46.877
Oh, my God.

01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:50.881
Honey, honey.

01:23:50.914 --> 01:23:52.850
Maddy, babe.

01:23:52.883 --> 01:23:53.884
Well, what, is she...

01:23:55.052 --> 01:23:57.388
Vicky, please!

01:23:57.422 --> 01:23:59.756
Switch!

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:01.126
One, two...

01:24:01.159 --> 01:24:02.759
- Three, four...
- Faster!

01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.728
Five, six, seven, eight,

01:24:04.761 --> 01:24:06.164
- Nine, ten...
- Come on, baby.

01:24:06.197 --> 01:24:08.999
11, 12, 13, 14...

01:24:09.032 --> 01:24:14.905
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.781
27, 28, 29...

01:24:24.815 --> 01:24:26.317
- 29, 30.
- Stop!

01:24:35.193 --> 01:24:38.028
It's working, it's working...

01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:39.330
I think.

01:24:39.364 --> 01:24:40.764
It's okay.

01:24:40.797 --> 01:24:42.167
- He's gonna be okay.
- Come on.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.434
He's breathing.

01:24:43.468 --> 01:24:46.204
We gotta get him
out of here. Rick!

01:24:47.472 --> 01:24:50.175
Mom, he's gonna make it.

01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:53.043
I need to take him
out of here.

01:24:53.076 --> 01:24:54.678
One, two, three!

01:25:08.359 --> 01:25:10.093
- This good?
- That's perfect.

01:25:10.128 --> 01:25:13.198
As soon as more people come,
we need to get them registered.

01:25:13.231 --> 01:25:14.332
- I can do that.
- Okay.

01:25:14.365 --> 01:25:16.066
We need to call
the power company,

01:25:16.099 --> 01:25:17.202
get them to shut
the grid down.

01:25:17.235 --> 01:25:19.504
I can do that...

01:25:19.537 --> 01:25:22.072
as soon as we get service.

01:25:26.144 --> 01:25:28.946
She's gotta get to a hospital.

01:25:28.979 --> 01:25:30.348
Can you take them?

01:25:30.381 --> 01:25:32.350
I need to look for Peyton.

01:25:32.383 --> 01:25:33.817
You're not coming?

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.220
I'm gonna keep looking
for Peyton.

01:25:35.253 --> 01:25:37.821
Why don't I stay?

01:25:37.854 --> 01:25:39.856
You two go.

01:25:41.992 --> 01:25:43.394
Uh...

01:25:44.861 --> 01:25:46.264
Are you sure?

01:25:46.297 --> 01:25:47.998
Yeah.

01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:49.267
Thank you.

01:26:36.447 --> 01:26:40.184
<i>Give first responders space

01:26:40.218 --> 01:26:41.885

Excuse me.

01:26:59.237 --> 01:27:01.038
Excuse me.

01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:02.072
Hey, watch him.

01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:05.343
Excuse me.

01:27:06.611 --> 01:27:09.946
Can we load your truck up?
These people are hurt.

01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:14.319
You were all
under this overpass?

01:27:14.352 --> 01:27:15.586
Did you hear me?

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.088
It's Brad, isn't it?

01:27:18.122 --> 01:27:20.358
Under the overpass.

01:27:20.391 --> 01:27:23.461
We need your help.

01:27:23.494 --> 01:27:26.197
Brad, we need your help.

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:27.598
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

01:27:27.632 --> 01:27:29.200
Get the other side of him.
Get the other side.

01:27:29.233 --> 01:27:31.636
- Get him in the truck.
- Come on, come on.

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:33.104
Watch his hand.

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:35.173
Come on.

01:27:35.206 --> 01:27:37.508
It's okay, come on.

01:27:45.416 --> 01:27:47.385
Now, easy with him.
Watch his hand.

01:27:47.418 --> 01:27:49.387
His hand, goddamn it.

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:01.632
Now, I don't know
this guy's name,

01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:04.635
but his fiancée is Ana Gomez.

01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:06.270
- Now, you got that?
- Yeah.

01:28:06.304 --> 01:28:08.373
Now tell whoever
you drop him off with,

01:28:08.406 --> 01:28:10.508
Ana Maria Gomez.

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:12.377
Okay, got it.
Ana Maria Gomez.

01:28:13.411 --> 01:28:15.413
Ana Maria Gomez.

01:28:27.592 --> 01:28:31.562
Just gotta sign this
to get her registered, okay?

01:28:34.165 --> 01:28:36.434
I'm so sorry.

01:28:42.038 --> 01:28:43.408
Help!

01:28:43.441 --> 01:28:46.277
Somebody! Somebody!

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:47.911
Come this way.

01:28:49.714 --> 01:28:53.418
This is where we have
triage set up, over here.

01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:54.585
This way.

01:28:54.619 --> 01:28:57.288
Steve, will you help me?

01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:59.923
We're gonna transfer him.

01:29:01.057 --> 01:29:02.693
Mom, Mom...

01:29:02.727 --> 01:29:05.463
Hold him tight.

01:29:07.198 --> 01:29:08.466
Oh, be careful.

01:29:08.499 --> 01:29:11.602
Baby, just stay with me, baby.

01:29:23.748 --> 01:29:25.750
We will travel with him
soon enough.

01:29:25.783 --> 01:29:28.319
Okay. Thank you.

01:29:28.352 --> 01:29:29.953
Thank you.

01:29:46.103 --> 01:29:47.638
Jess?

01:29:49.106 --> 01:29:50.107
Jess.

01:29:54.245 --> 01:29:55.646
Where's Peyton?

01:29:57.782 --> 01:30:00.083
We kept looking for her, but...

01:30:00.117 --> 01:30:02.520
- What? What?
- I don't know.

01:30:07.525 --> 01:30:08.992
Peyton!

01:30:29.313 --> 01:30:31.014
Peyton!

01:31:28.472 --> 01:31:30.608
Um, they told me
to bring him here.

01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:33.344
Yeah.

01:31:35.212 --> 01:31:36.581
Now...

01:31:36.614 --> 01:31:38.449
you look after him.

01:32:08.913 --> 01:32:11.349
Be about two minutes, okay?

01:32:11.382 --> 01:32:12.383
Yeah.

01:32:22.927 --> 01:32:27.131
Hey! Hey, did you find her?

01:32:28.532 --> 01:32:31.369
I don't think
she could've survived that.

01:32:31.402 --> 01:32:32.637
You just decided that?

01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:34.238
There's no way
you could know that.

01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:36.140
Babe? Babe.

01:32:37.274 --> 01:32:39.143
Oh, my God.

01:32:39.944 --> 01:32:41.412
Oh.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.182
Look at you.

01:32:49.687 --> 01:32:51.422
What the hell are you doing?

01:32:53.591 --> 01:32:55.693
Mom. No, Mom.

01:32:57.428 --> 01:32:59.830
- Leave. Now.
- Mom.

01:33:07.438 --> 01:33:08.839
Hey.

01:33:13.978 --> 01:33:15.312
Hey.

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:38.335
Um...

01:33:41.005 --> 01:33:43.441
Would you get me some water?

01:33:43.474 --> 01:33:45.710
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:33:45.743 --> 01:33:47.745
I'll be right back.

01:34:01.892 --> 01:34:03.027
Maddy, honey.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.595
- Mom...
- You can't possibly...

01:34:05.763 --> 01:34:08.365
Just close the door.

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.776
You're my masterpiece,
you know that?

01:34:26.684 --> 01:34:28.753
Phones are back up.

01:34:28.786 --> 01:34:30.755
Let's get on the horn

01:34:30.788 --> 01:34:32.757
and get more volunteers
communicating with EMS.

01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:35.259
I'm just gonna try my parents.

01:34:36.527 --> 01:34:38.896
We got three more
fire trucks coming in

01:34:38.929 --> 01:34:40.132
from adjacent counties.

01:34:43.801 --> 01:34:46.537
- The grid's supposed to be off.
- Kim was going to do it.

01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:48.906
Hey, can we get
some help over here?

01:34:48.939 --> 01:34:51.275
This one, this one...

01:34:52.676 --> 01:34:54.645
and this one.

01:34:54.678 --> 01:34:55.679
What's happening?

01:34:55.713 --> 01:34:57.648
He's getting an ambulance ride.

01:34:57.681 --> 01:35:00.417
You can fill that out.

01:35:01.819 --> 01:35:04.655
Hey, he's gonna
make it, right?

01:35:04.688 --> 01:35:06.657
- Are you...
- I'm her son.

01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:08.425
No.

01:35:14.431 --> 01:35:16.300
No, he is not.

01:35:34.852 --> 01:35:36.854
Sir, you need to move.

01:35:36.887 --> 01:35:38.856
Excuse us.

01:35:55.639 --> 01:35:58.342
Carlos, Carlos.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.014
Ana...

01:36:08.153 --> 01:36:11.589
Excuse me, I'm gonna ask you
to fill out this form for me

01:36:11.622 --> 01:36:13.624
and get it back to me
as soon as you can.

01:36:16.493 --> 01:36:17.394
Sì.

01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:27.037
Ana, no.

01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:53.664
It's okay.

01:36:59.536 --> 01:37:01.538
Okay.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.656
Do you need help
filling it in?

01:37:18.689 --> 01:37:20.791
Huh?

01:37:20.824 --> 01:37:23.427
No, I'm... I'm fine.

01:37:28.098 --> 01:37:30.434
Is he undocumented?

01:37:35.706 --> 01:37:38.008
Will they send him back?

01:37:39.977 --> 01:37:42.680
Will they help him first if I...

01:37:42.713 --> 01:37:44.215
Yes, yes.

01:37:44.249 --> 01:37:46.617
But even so,
there will be costs.

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:51.689
You need to know
it could be a lot.

01:37:51.722 --> 01:37:53.824
I understand.

01:37:53.857 --> 01:37:56.127
Okay. I'll be right back.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.028
Ana...

01:38:33.897 --> 01:38:35.532
Tranquilo.

01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:16.207
Mama!

01:39:19.676 --> 01:39:21.678
Mama!

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.082
Peyton!

01:39:31.389 --> 01:39:32.689
Peyton!

01:39:32.723 --> 01:39:34.558
Mama!

01:39:37.094 --> 01:39:38.796
Mama!

01:39:39.963 --> 01:39:41.199
Mama!

01:39:41.232 --> 01:39:44.935
- Peyton! Peyton!
- Mama!

01:39:44.968 --> 01:39:47.238
Mama!

01:39:48.406 --> 01:39:49.940
Mama!

01:39:49.973 --> 01:39:51.242
Peyton!

01:39:52.843 --> 01:39:54.078
- Mama!
- Peyton!

01:39:54.112 --> 01:39:55.579
Peyton!

01:39:56.847 --> 01:39:57.848
Okay, baby.

01:40:02.253 --> 01:40:04.222
Stop. Stop, okay?

01:40:04.255 --> 01:40:05.956
Stay back! Stay back.

01:40:05.989 --> 01:40:08.126
Mama!

01:40:10.861 --> 01:40:12.096
Peyton!

01:40:53.904 --> 01:40:54.905
Daniel.

01:41:01.212 --> 01:41:03.181
You okay?

01:41:04.047 --> 01:41:05.316
I am.

01:41:07.784 --> 01:41:08.785
Good.

01:43:43.107 --> 01:43:44.074
Kim!

01:43:44.108 --> 01:43:46.043
Brad!

01:43:46.076 --> 01:43:48.313
- Kim!
- Brad!

01:43:48.346 --> 01:43:49.946
Kim.

01:43:53.083 --> 01:43:54.084
Hi.

01:43:57.655 --> 01:43:59.357
You okay?

01:44:01.359 --> 01:44:03.594
- All right. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:44:03.628 --> 01:44:06.096
- I'm so happy.
- Mm-hmm.
