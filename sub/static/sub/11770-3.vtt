( male )
SO, MY AGENT CALLS,

00:17.633 --> 00:19.600
AND HE HAS AN AUDITION
FOR ME FOR A BIKER.

00:19.633 --> 00:20.233
RIGHT.

00:20.267 --> 00:21.767
SO, I'M JUST PSYCHED,

00:21.800 --> 00:23.933
AND I GET
MY HELL'S ANGELS JACKET ON,

00:23.967 --> 00:25.933
AND MY LEATHER
AND I BUST INTO THE ROOM.

00:25.967 --> 00:29.833
AND THERE'S 30 ACTORS
WITH BICYCLE SHORTS ON,

00:29.867 --> 00:30.900
THE SPANDEX ONES.

00:30.933 --> 00:31.867
( laughing )

00:31.900 --> 00:33.300
AND LITTLE GLOVES,
AND I'M JUST GOING,

00:33.333 --> 00:35.200
"OH, BRUTAL."

00:35.233 --> 00:37.467
HI.
HI.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.633
YOU REMEMBER BRAD,
OR YOU, YOU--

00:40.667 --> 00:41.467
THIS IS BRAD.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.700
HEY, BRAD.

00:42.733 --> 00:44.533
GOSH, I DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR YOU COME IN.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.367
YEAH, WELL, YOU WERE
LAUGHING PRETTY HARD.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.433
I GUESS YOU COULDN'T
HEAR THE DOOR.

00:47.467 --> 00:48.833
THAT WAS FUNNY.

00:48.867 --> 00:52.667
HE WAS TELLING ME
SOME BAD AUDITION STORIES.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.567
YEAH, IT'S HARD
BEING AN ACTOR.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.067
IT IS, IT IS.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.100
IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.433
NO, YOU SEEM
TO BE DOING ALRIGHT.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.067
YEAH.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.267
WELL, UM, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS CONTINUE.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.500
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS,
NO BIG DEAL,

01:04.533 --> 01:05.700
AND I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.800
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

01:06.833 --> 01:08.667
NO, NO, I GOT TO GO,
I GOT AN AUDITION.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.667
YEAH, NO,
I GOT TO GO.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.600
AND I WILL SEE YOU THURSDAY
AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

01:12.633 --> 01:13.867
YEAH, ALRIGHT.

01:13.900 --> 01:14.533
THANKS FOR THE BEER.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.533
YEAH.

01:15.567 --> 01:16.367
OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.333
BYE, BRAD.

01:17.367 --> 01:19.667
BYE.
SEE YA.

01:21.367 --> 01:25.200
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING,
MAYBE I'LL GO OUT AND GET MYSELF

01:25.233 --> 01:28.300
A HETEROSEXUAL SINGLE WOMAN
TO PLAY GOLF WITH.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.167
OH, LARRY, ARE YOU
A LITTLE JEALOUS,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.467
NO, I'M JUST--
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.067
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT I'M GONNA--

01:33.100 --> 01:35.233
I CAN'T HAVE A FRIEND ?

01:35.267 --> 01:36.600
AH, YOU'RE PRETTY NAIVE.

01:36.633 --> 01:37.367
WE CAN'T PLAY TENNIS--

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
PLAY TENNIS,
I DON'T CARE.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.733
HE STILL WANTS
TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.067
HE'S A MAN,
HE'S ATTRACTED TO YOU,

01:41.100 --> 01:42.133
AND HE WANTS
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.133
YOU DON'T
THINK HE DOES ?

01:43.167 --> 01:44.200
NO, I DON'T
THINK HE DOES.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.533
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MEN.

01:45.567 --> 01:46.133
OH, IS THAT RIGHT ?

01:46.167 --> 01:47.333
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.067
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE

01:49.100 --> 01:51.500
PLAYING TENNIS WITH HIM
IF YOU PLAYED TENNIS WITH ME.

01:51.533 --> 01:52.600
YOU WANT TO PLAY
TENNIS WITH ME ?

01:52.633 --> 01:54.067
I'LL PLAY TENNIS
WITH YOU, FINE.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.633
OKAY.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.267
YEAH,
YOU'LL CALL HIM UP,

01:57.300 --> 01:58.633
JUST SAY YOU'RE PLAYING TENNIS
WITH ME ON THURSDAY.

01:58.667 --> 01:59.600
ALRIGHT, I WILL.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.300
ALRIGHT.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.333
THAT'LL BE LOVELY.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.600
BOY, THE RESTAURANT'S
LOOKING GOOD.

02:05.633 --> 02:06.533
LOOKS GREAT.

02:06.567 --> 02:08.300
YEAH, I KNOW, WOW.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.267
YEAH,
THREE WEEKS AWAY.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.567
YOU HAPPY YOU DID IT ?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.767
THIS IS VERY COOL,
I'M GLAD YOU TALKED ME INTO IT.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.733
YEAH, HOW YOU DOING ?

02:15.967 --> 02:17.133
YESTERDAY
I GET HOME,

02:17.167 --> 02:18.567
THERE'S THIS GUY
IN MY LIVING ROOM.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.233
HE PLAYS TENNIS WITH MY WIFE,
HE'S AN ACTOR, YOU KNOW,

02:20.267 --> 02:22.500
I SAID, IT'S WRONG.

02:22.533 --> 02:26.167
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT THIS, WHAT,
THIS HETEROSEXUAL FRIEND ?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.400
WHY IS HE
AT YOUR HOUSE ?

02:27.433 --> 02:28.933
I KNOW, WHY IS HE
AT MY HOUSE, EXACTLY.

02:28.967 --> 02:29.767
AND, YOU KNOW,
SHE SAID,

02:29.800 --> 02:30.967
"THEN YOU PLAY
TENNIS WITH ME."

02:31.067 --> 02:32.300
SO, I SAID, OKAY,
I'LL PLAY TENNIS WITH YOU.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.567
SO, NOW I GOT TO
PLAY TENNIS WITH HER.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.633
THAT'S BETTER
THAN HIM PULLING SOMETHING.

02:35.667 --> 02:36.333
HUH ?

02:36.367 --> 02:37.167
BETTER THAN--

02:37.200 --> 02:38.567
HEY !
OH, GEEZ.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.533
WHAT THE HELL ?

02:39.567 --> 02:40.567
IS THAT COFFEE ?

02:40.600 --> 02:43.100
GIVE ME TABLE SALT,
WE'VE GOT A SPILL.

02:43.133 --> 02:43.933
GIVE ME A TOWEL.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.800
WOW.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.133
ALRIGHT.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

02:49.267 --> 02:51.800
THIS IS AN OLD
RESTAURANT TRICK.

02:51.833 --> 02:55.133
YOU GOT TO DILUTE THE STAIN
WITH CLUB SODA.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.100
UH-HUH.

02:56.133 --> 03:00.700
AND THEN YOU
PUT ON TABLE SALT.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.733
CLUB SODA
AND THEN SALT, HUH ?

03:02.767 --> 03:03.967
THAT'S GONNA
GET THAT STAIN OUT ?

03:04.067 --> 03:05.233
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

03:05.267 --> 03:06.400
GET OUT OF HERE,
REALLY ?

03:06.433 --> 03:07.667
NOW THIS HAS GOT
TO SET A FEW MINUTES

03:07.700 --> 03:08.500
AND THEN IT'LL BE FINE.

03:08.533 --> 03:09.067
IS THAT SO ?

03:09.100 --> 03:10.433
OH, YES.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.100
WELL, I LOVE THAT.

03:12.133 --> 03:13.200
HEY, UH, LARRY.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.067
HEY, RANDY.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.967
WE NEED TO TALK.

03:17.067 --> 03:17.667
YOU GOT A MINUTE ?

03:17.700 --> 03:18.600
SURE.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.467
HEY, RANDY.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.167
UH, HEY, JEFF.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.100
UM, I'M OUT, GUYS.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

03:30.467 --> 03:31.267
OUT, OUT OF WHAT ?

03:31.300 --> 03:33.067
I CAN'T DO THIS,
I CAN'T COOK.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.733
I CAN'T COOK
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.667
I'M NO GOOD,
I SUCK.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.900
WHAT ?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:39.933 --> 03:40.900
YOU COOKED
AT MY HOUSE LAST WEEK.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.433
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.067
YOU DON'T WANT ME,
I'M DOING YOU A BIG FAVOR,
BELIEVE ME.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.233
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT,
PEANUTS ?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.533
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT ?

03:46.567 --> 03:48.067
THAT DIDN'T HELP,
BECAUSE A LOT OF COOKS,

03:48.067 --> 03:50.433
YOU KNOW, IT'S FROWNED ON
WHEN THEY POISON SOMEONE.

03:50.467 --> 03:51.767
WELL, IS IT BECAUSE
HE ASKED FOR KETCHUP ?

03:51.800 --> 03:52.733
I ALWAYS HAVE KETCHUP.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.567
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.500
MY MOM
GAVE ME KETCHUP.

03:54.533 --> 03:55.933
HE LOVES KETCHUP,
SO WHAT ?

03:55.967 --> 03:56.833
YOU CAN'T GO BY HIM.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.300
WHERE'S THIS
COMING FROM ?

03:58.333 --> 03:59.333
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

03:59.367 --> 04:00.867
IT'S COMING
FROM THE PRESSURE.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.067
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A BIG CELEBRITY RESTAURANT,

04:03.067 --> 04:04.300
I'VE BEEN READING
ALL THE PUBLICITY.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.500
IT'S MAKING ME NUTS,
I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.700
WHAT ?!

04:06.733 --> 04:08.067
THIS PLACE IS GONNA
GET REVIEWED, YOU KNOW.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.267
IT'S GONNA
GET REVIEWED.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.933
YOU'VE BUILT THIS UP
IN YOUR IMAGINATION, MAN.

04:10.967 --> 04:11.833
THIS IS CRAZY.

04:11.867 --> 04:12.733
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.633
IT IS NOT ME,
CAN'T DO IT.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.067
JUST, I'M SORRY.

04:16.067 --> 04:16.967
CAN'T.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.800
HEY, RANDY.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.467
LOOK, MAN, I'M SORRY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.100
WHAT ?

04:28.233 --> 04:29.700
HUH.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.200
HE JUST QUIT.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.433
RANDY JUST QUIT ?

04:33.467 --> 04:34.667
WELL, WHY ?

04:34.700 --> 04:37.200
HE WAS UPSET, HE JUST DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE HE CAN DO IT.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.600
HE FELT INADEQUATE AND DIDN'T
THINK HE WAS A GOOD COOK,

04:39.633 --> 04:41.467
AND ALL THE PRESSURE
OF THE RESTAURANT OPENING.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.700
THE REVIEWS, HE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE REVIEWED.

04:42.733 --> 04:43.767
AND ALL THE PUBLICITY.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
A CHEF DOESN'T WANT
TO BE REVIEWED ?

04:44.833 --> 04:46.167
A CHEF DOESN'T
WANT TO BE REVIEWED.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.900
WAS IT THE WHOLE
PEANUT THING ?

04:47.933 --> 04:48.900
IS THAT WHAT UPSET HIM ?

04:48.933 --> 04:51.167
NO, WE NEVER MENTIONED
THE PEANUT THING.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.767
NO, HE JUST,
HE FEELS PRESSURE.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.700
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEAS,
LIKE, THREE WEEKS AWAY,

04:57.733 --> 04:58.600
WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO ?

04:58.633 --> 05:00.267
FIND SOMEBODY.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.067
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY,
BUT WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.233
I DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY, NO.

05:03.267 --> 05:04.800
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.233
JOSH.

05:06.267 --> 05:07.367
JOSH WOULD BE GREAT.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.067
JOSH, THE GUY WHO
COOKS FOR US AT HOME.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.600
HE'D BE FABULOUS.

05:10.633 --> 05:13.800
IF WE COULD COME OVER
AND TRY IT ?

05:13.833 --> 05:15.067
YEAH.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.700
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY WE'D HAVE TO,
WE'D HAVE TO COME OVER

05:17.733 --> 05:19.067
AND SAMPLE IT, RIGHT ?

05:19.100 --> 05:21.067
AH, C'MON OVER
AND YOU CAN SAMPLE IT.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.200
OH, YES,
HE'S A GREAT COOK.

05:23.233 --> 05:24.967
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HOLD HIM BACK, HUH ?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.067
NO, NO.

05:26.067 --> 05:29.233
OH, MY GOD !

05:29.267 --> 05:31.100
HE GOT IT ALL OUT,
THE STAIN'S GONE.

05:31.133 --> 05:33.367
CLUB SODA AND SALT.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.533
THE TRICK IS TO GET
TO THE STAIN BEFORE IT DRIES.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.500
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THAT, UM...

05:45.533 --> 05:47.633
THAT PLACE
FOR YOUR PARENTS ?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.333
I'M GETTING THEM
THAT APARTMENT ON BARRINGTON.

05:49.367 --> 05:50.567
ALRIGHT.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.067
OH.

05:53.067 --> 05:54.533
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I SWEAR TO YOU,

05:54.567 --> 05:56.200
I'M GONNA KILL YOU
WHEN THAT BALL HITS ME.

05:56.233 --> 05:59.667
SO, MY MOTHER WILL START
GETTING THAT NEW TREATMENT

05:59.700 --> 06:01.833
AT CEDAR SINAI AND HOPEFULLY
SHE'LL GET BETTER

06:01.867 --> 06:03.300
AND THEY'LL GO HOME.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.100
HEY, MELANIE, ED.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.533
HEY, HOW ARE
YOU GUYS DOING ?

06:08.567 --> 06:09.733
HEY, GOOD.

06:09.767 --> 06:10.700
LAWRENCE.

06:10.733 --> 06:12.367
WELL, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.667
HI.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.067
BOY, YOU GUYS
LOOK GOOD.

06:15.067 --> 06:16.400
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.367
JUST PLAYING
SOME TENNIS.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.367
PLAYING SOME TENNIS,
YEAH.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
SO ARE WE.

06:19.433 --> 06:20.900
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU GUYS.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.767
THANK YOU.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.633
ALRIGHT.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.133
YEAH,
HAVE A GOOD GAME.

06:25.167 --> 06:25.800
YES.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.600
B'BYE.
YOU TOO.

06:29.633 --> 06:31.633
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ?

06:31.667 --> 06:33.833
I DON'T KNOW.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.600
THEY WERE-- SHE WAS ACTING LIKE
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.667
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CALLED HER ?

06:38.700 --> 06:41.200
I DON'T KNOW,
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO, MAYBE.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.867
UH-HUH.

06:42.900 --> 06:46.500
UM, OH, MY GOD.

06:46.533 --> 06:50.233
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER REALLY
BOUGHT 'EM A WEDDING GIFT.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.600
AND IT'S BEEN
OVER A YEAR.

06:52.633 --> 06:53.633
YEAH,
IT'S OVER A YEAR.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.300
HOW DID WE FORGET
A WEDDING GIFT ?

06:55.333 --> 06:57.867
WE SHOULD JUST
PICK SOMETHING UP.

06:57.900 --> 06:58.733
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT--

06:58.767 --> 07:00.133
FINE, FINE,
WE'LL GET THEM--

07:00.167 --> 07:01.633
EVERY TIME WE RUN INTO THEM
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE THAT.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.700
I KNOW BUT IT'S RIDICULOUS
TO JUST HARBOR A GRUDGE,

07:03.733 --> 07:05.067
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
GET THEM A PRESENT.

07:05.067 --> 07:08.200
WE WENT OUT OF OUR WAY TO FLY
TO CHICAGO TO THEIR WEDDING.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.367
WE SHOULD JUST PICK
SOMETHING UP FOR THEM.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.300
BUY 'EM A CAR.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.633
UH !

07:16.733 --> 07:17.833
UH !

07:20.067 --> 07:21.867
UH !

07:21.900 --> 07:23.600
YOU OKAY ?

07:23.633 --> 07:24.567
UH !

07:24.600 --> 07:25.333
UH !

07:27.500 --> 07:28.300
UH !

07:30.767 --> 07:32.067
IS THAT GOOD ?

07:32.067 --> 07:32.567
IT WAS OUT.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.500
THAT WAS OUT ?

07:33.533 --> 07:34.767
YEAH.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.367
IF WE WERE PLAYING DOUBLES
IT WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GOTTA
STOP THE GRUNTING.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.067
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

07:41.067 --> 07:42.667
YOU GRUNT
ON EVERY SHOT.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.800
EVERY SHOT YOU HIT,
YOU, "UH, UH",

07:44.833 --> 07:46.533
YOU MAKE THIS
DISGUSTING NOISE.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.433
( snorting )

07:48.467 --> 07:49.067
YOU DON'T HEAR IT ?

07:49.067 --> 07:50.200
NO.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.100
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, "NO" ?

07:51.133 --> 07:52.133
THAT'S HOW
I PLAY TENNIS.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.133
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS DOING IT.

07:53.167 --> 07:54.367
WELL, YOU GRUNT
EVERY SHOT.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.467
IT'S REALLY ANNOYING
AND IT'S THROWING ME OFF.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.633
OH, IS THAT,
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE LOSING ?

07:58.667 --> 08:01.667
IT SOUNDS LIKE
PIGS FUCKING.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.600
HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS,
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO LISTEN TO THIS, HUH ?

08:04.633 --> 08:05.667
UH !

08:05.700 --> 08:07.600
I DON'T MIND IT.

08:08.433 --> 08:09.767
UH !

08:10.633 --> 08:12.333
ALRIGHT,
THAT'S A GAME.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.067
AND SET.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.900
( laughing )

08:18.433 --> 08:22.167
I REALLY THINK I'VE FINALLY
FOUND THE PERFECT SOCK.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.867
I'M NOT KIDDING.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.733
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHITE.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.133
YOU DON'T WANT
A WHITE SOCK.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.600
IT'S SORT OF A...

08:29.300 --> 08:31.133
IS THIS BORING YOU ?

08:31.167 --> 08:33.333
I DON'T KNOW,
IF YOU HAD SAID TO ME,

08:33.367 --> 08:35.133
I FOUND A PERFECT PAIR OF SOCKS,
I'D GO, NO KIDDING,

08:35.167 --> 08:37.233
WHERE'D YOU GET THEM,
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE ?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.633
SO, YOU KNOW THAT PLAY,
"TONY AND TINA'S WEDDING" ?

08:43.667 --> 08:45.633
I THINK I MIGHT
GO ON FRIDAY.

08:48.133 --> 08:49.700
OH.

08:49.733 --> 08:50.967
WHAT ?

08:51.067 --> 08:52.933
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU ?

08:52.967 --> 08:55.300
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU'D WANT TO GO.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.867
I'M JUST,
I'M THROWING IT OUT THERE.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.200
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T
I WANT TO GO ?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.900
I ENJOY THE THEATER
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY.

09:00.067 --> 09:03.967
BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS
MIX IN WITH THE AUDIENCE.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.433
SO WHAT,
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

09:05.467 --> 09:06.067
YOU ARE ?

09:06.067 --> 09:06.733
YEAH.

09:06.767 --> 09:07.900
OKAY, GOOD.

09:09.633 --> 09:13.433
WHAT, HOW COME YOU
WANT TO GO SEE THAT ?

09:13.467 --> 09:16.333
UH, I'VE JUST HEARD
A LOT ABOUT IT.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.400
YOU KNOW,
AND BRAD'S IN IT.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.200
SO...

09:25.633 --> 09:26.733
OH.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.700
WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU ?

09:29.733 --> 09:31.300
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
GOING TO SEE

09:31.333 --> 09:35.067
"TONY AND TINA'S WEDDING"
ON FRIDAY NIGHT,

09:35.067 --> 09:37.667
AND...

09:37.700 --> 09:40.433
BRAD IS IN IT.

09:40.467 --> 09:43.900
I WANT US TO GO SEE
"TONY AND TINA'S WEDDING".

09:43.933 --> 09:45.067
OH, DO YOU ?

09:45.067 --> 09:45.833
I DO.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.200
YEAH.

09:47.233 --> 09:49.067
YOU KNOW WHAT, GO SEE
"TONY AND TINA'S WEDDING".

09:49.100 --> 09:50.067
THAT'S FINE.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.933
NO, I WANT US
TO GO TOGETHER.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.100
YEAH, I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.633
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
THAT HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.467
I MEANT, "WE".

09:57.500 --> 09:58.833
I'LL JUST GO
SEE THE SHOW AND GO HOME.

09:58.867 --> 09:59.833
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:59.867 --> 10:00.900
OH, NO, LISTEN.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.667
YOU AND BRAD CAN GO OUT
AND HAVE SOME BEERS.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.567
I WAS SAYING, "WE",
IT WAS THE ASSUMED, "WE".

10:05.600 --> 10:07.233
THERE WAS
NO ASSUMED "WE".

10:07.267 --> 10:09.367
YOU SAID, "I".

10:09.400 --> 10:11.600
YOU'RE READING
THINGS INTO IT.

10:11.633 --> 10:12.200
I DON'T THINK I AM.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.967
I THINK YOU ARE.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.800
I THINK YOU'RE COMPLETELY
READING THINGS INTO THIS.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.033
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:17.067 --> 10:18.000
YOU ARE SO BUSTED.

10:18.033 --> 10:18.967
I AM NOT.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.267
LISTEN, I WANT
TO GO WITH YOU.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.233
NO.

10:22.267 --> 10:23.533
DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO WITH ME ?

10:23.567 --> 10:24.833
I DON'T KNOW.

10:24.867 --> 10:26.567
IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU'LL DO FOR IT.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.933
WELL, I'LL DO JUST
ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:27.967 --> 10:28.600
REALLY,
IS THAT RIGHT ?

10:28.633 --> 10:29.867
YEAH, YEAH.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.133
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT ?

10:31.167 --> 10:32.900
NO, I LIKE THIS.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.000
GETTING IN TROUBLE,
USING SEX TO GET OUT OF IT.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.033
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.667
OKAY, GOOD,
THEN WE'RE BOTH HAPPY.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.033
OH, SHIT.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.567
ALRIGHT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.800
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S CRANBERRY JUICE.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.100
IT'S NOT GONNA
COME OUT ANYWAY.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.367
COME HERE.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.067
OH, NO, NO, WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.667
I SAW THIS THING
AT THE RESTAURANT TODAY.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.433
CLUB SODA AND SALT !

10:50.467 --> 10:51.567
GETS THE WHOLE
STAIN OUT.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.100
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S AN OLD RUG.

10:54.133 --> 10:54.833
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.000
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.133
WAIT 'TIL YOU SEE THIS.

10:57.167 --> 10:59.467
YOU'RE GONNA BE AMAZED,
TIME'S OF THE ESSENCE !

11:05.267 --> 11:07.067
WHERE'S THE SALT ?!

11:08.633 --> 11:09.900
WHERE'S THE SALT ?!

11:09.933 --> 11:11.900
IT'S BY THE STOVE !

11:21.333 --> 11:22.300
I HOPE
I'M NOT TOO LATE.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.267
THAT'S THE ONLY
THING I HOPE.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.067
I HOPE
I'M NOT TOO LATE.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.100
CLUB SODA, OKAY ?

11:28.133 --> 11:31.800
PUT THE CLUB SODA,
USE VERY LIBERALLY,

11:31.833 --> 11:32.367
DO A TAP TAP.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.067
I SAW HIM TAP TAP.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.667
NOW THE SALT,
SALT ALL OVER.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.133
DON'T SPARE THE SALT.

11:39.167 --> 11:43.467
AND YOU ARE GONNA BE AMAZED
AT HOW THIS WORKS.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
THAT'S IT.

11:44.533 --> 11:45.600
THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO DO.

11:45.633 --> 11:50.300
AND, WE'VE, UH...

11:50.333 --> 11:54.200
STILL GOT A FEW MINUTES
'TIL IT DRIES.

11:54.233 --> 11:56.433
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND ?

11:56.467 --> 11:57.633
WHY ?

11:57.667 --> 11:58.567
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.500
C'MON, WE GOT

A WHOLE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

12:02.233 --> 12:03.667
THAT HAS SLAMMED CLOSED.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GAVE ME
A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY ?

12:05.467 --> 12:06.400
HONEY.

12:06.433 --> 12:07.167

12:07.200 --> 12:08.700

12:19.100 --> 12:22.933
WHEN YOU GET UP
TOMORROW MORNING,

12:22.967 --> 12:24.867
THAT STAIN'S

12:24.900 --> 12:27.900

12:43.667 --> 12:44.667
YOU'RE IN

12:44.700 --> 12:45.500
HE'S VERY EXCITED.

12:45.533 --> 12:46.667
HEY, JOSH !

12:46.700 --> 12:47.967
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HE'S EXCITED ?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.467
HE'S SO EXCITED.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.933
HI, GENTLEMEN,
HOW ARE YOU ?

12:50.967 --> 12:51.633
I'M JOSH.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.533
LARRY.

12:52.567 --> 12:53.967
YEAH, JEFF.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.100
JEFF, NICE
TO MEET YOU.

12:55.133 --> 12:57.133
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

12:57.167 --> 13:00.233
FOR POSSIBLY BEING YOUR CHEF
FOR THE NEW RESTAURANT.

13:00.267 --> 13:02.467
I'M GONNA RUN BACK IN
AND DO SOME LAST MINUTE PREP,

13:02.500 --> 13:03.800
BUT I WILL
SEE YOU IN A BIT.

13:03.833 --> 13:04.733
THANK YOU.

13:04.767 --> 13:05.933
THIS IS GONNA
BE FUN, C'MON.

13:05.967 --> 13:06.833
WHAT DID YOU DO,
YOU TOLD HIM ?

13:06.867 --> 13:08.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DID I DO ?

13:08.067 --> 13:09.833
WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT WE WERE COMING TO,

13:09.867 --> 13:10.600
FOR THAT PURPOSE ?

13:10.633 --> 13:11.900
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

13:11.933 --> 13:13.433
JUST TELL HIM
FRIENDS OVER FOR DINNER.

13:13.467 --> 13:14.733
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL HIM
HAT THE WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT.

13:14.767 --> 13:15.733
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

13:15.767 --> 13:17.867
AN AUDITION'S
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.867
WE HAVE THREE WEEKS,
THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.433
THIS IS NOT--
HE'S A GOOD COOK.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.467
RELAX, COME ENJOY.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.333
C'MON, SERIOUSLY.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.700
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

13:35.533 --> 13:37.600
PASS THE, UH,
SALT, PLEASE ?

13:50.900 --> 13:51.767
THAT'S A NICE SHIRT.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.967
YEAH, MY MOM
GOT IT FOR ME.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.900
SHE DROPPED IT OFF
AT THE OFFICE.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.400
WHAT IS THAT, LIKE,
A VELOUR OR SOMETHING ?

13:58.433 --> 14:01.600
DON'T KNOW,
IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.767
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

14:03.800 --> 14:04.433
C'MON.

14:04.467 --> 14:05.567
FOOD ?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.067
YEAH.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.200
GREAT !

14:07.233 --> 14:08.600
YEAH, GREAT.

14:08.633 --> 14:09.567
HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.767
YEAH, MEAT,
HE REALLY DOES MEAT WELL.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.667
TENDER.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.400
YOU WERE RIGHT,
GOOD CALL.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.300
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
LARRY ?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.800
EH.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "EH" ?

14:22.800 --> 14:23.933
EH.

14:23.967 --> 14:25.300
YOU'RE CRAZY.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.800
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
YOU WALKED IN
WITH THIS ATTITUDE.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.067
I DIDN'T WALK IN
WITH ANY ATTITUDE.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.500
YOU DID TOO.

14:29.533 --> 14:30.633
I DID NOT WALK IN
WITH AN ATTITUDE.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.367
JUST AS I
TOLD HIM BEFORE.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.533
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

14:32.567 --> 14:33.367
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.533
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?

14:35.567 --> 14:36.800
'CAUSE YOU WEIGHT,
LIKE, EIGHT POUNDS.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.200
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT FOOD ?

14:38.233 --> 14:40.300
THIN PEOPLE KNOW MORE
ABOUT FOOD THAN FAT PEOPLE.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.800
I HAVE MORE FOOD EXPERIENCE
THAN YOU, MY FRIEND.

14:42.833 --> 14:43.700
OH, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, OKAY ?

14:43.733 --> 14:44.500
WHAT ?

14:44.533 --> 14:45.733
I NEVER GOT LAID A LOT,

14:45.767 --> 14:47.667
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THE GUY WHO LAID MORE THAN ME

14:47.700 --> 14:48.967
APPRECIATED IT
ANY MORE.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.067
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING ?

14:51.067 --> 14:53.467
A GUY WHO GETS LAID A LOT
KNOWS MORE ABOUT--

14:53.500 --> 14:55.067
OH, WAIT, WAIT,
HE MIGHT KNOW MORE ABOUT SEX

14:55.067 --> 14:57.067
BUT HE DOESN'T
APPRECIATE IT ANY MORE.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.500
I APPRECIATE IT.

14:58.533 --> 14:59.833
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SUCH
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.267
ALRIGHT, FINE,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.833
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ?

15:03.867 --> 15:07.433
WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
SOMEBODY WHO WE ALL AGREE ON.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.567
NO, I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ABOUT JOSH ?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.833
HE WORKED HIS HEART OUT
FOR THIS MEAL.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.267
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ?

15:14.300 --> 15:16.533
WE CAN'T HIRE HIM
IF WE DON'T ALL AGREE ON IT.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.200
ALRIGHT, FINE,
YOU TELL HIM.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.633
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL HIM.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.967
JOSH !

15:23.833 --> 15:25.233
GENTLEMEN,
HOW WAS EVERYTHING ?

15:25.267 --> 15:26.333
DID YOU ENJOY
YOUR LAMB ?

15:26.367 --> 15:27.367
WONDERFUL.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.167
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.500
GOOD.

15:29.533 --> 15:31.900
DID YOU ENJOY THE PLUM,
APRICOT, AND MINT CHUTNEY ?

15:31.933 --> 15:33.300
THE CHUTNEY
WAS AMAZING.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.900
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:36.933 --> 15:39.967
LARRY HAS SOMETHING
HE WANTS TO TELL YOU.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.933
YES, LARRY ?

15:41.967 --> 15:45.700
IT WAS GOOD.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.267
I JUST
DON'T THINK IT'S...

15:48.300 --> 15:51.200
IT'S QUITE RIGHT
FOR THE RESTAURANT THOUGH.

15:51.233 --> 15:55.067
WHAT WAS
WRONG WITH IT ?

15:55.900 --> 15:58.167
A LITTLE SAUCY.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.467
A LITTLE TOO SAUCY.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.333
SAUCY ?

16:01.367 --> 16:04.067
YEAH,
KIND OF SAUCY.

16:04.067 --> 16:07.067
WAS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE ?

16:07.067 --> 16:12.667
UH, NOT REALLY.

16:14.367 --> 16:16.467
I GUESS DESSERT'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.900
NO, I'LL STILL HAVE,
TAKE DESSERT.

16:18.933 --> 16:21.200
I'LL TAKE DESSERT TOO.

16:21.233 --> 16:22.067
OKAY.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.500
AND YOU HAVE DECAF ?

16:25.533 --> 16:29.400
I'D LOVE A DECAF TOO,
A LITTLE BIT OF SKIM MILK.

16:29.433 --> 16:30.900
TED ?

16:30.933 --> 16:32.533
NO.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.467
OKAY.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.767
WHAT SHOULD WE GET
FOR THEIR WEDDING PRESENT ?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.800
I LOVE HOW THESE PEOPLE
TAKE THEIR SHOPPING CARTS

16:44.833 --> 16:47.067
AND JUST BRING 'EM HOME
AND LEAVE THEM THERE.

16:47.067 --> 16:49.067
WHAT IS THAT ?

16:49.100 --> 16:53.433
SO, I WAS THINKING MAYBE
THAT STORE ON MONTANA AVENUE.

16:53.467 --> 16:57.700
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
DON'T LIKE NOT DRIVING.

16:57.733 --> 16:59.633
YOU SHOULD'VE
LET ME DRIVE.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.700
IT'S MY CAR.

17:01.733 --> 17:03.200
ON THE WAY BACK
I'M GONNA DRIVE.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.700
WHY ?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.767
I DON'T FEEL I HAVE
A PERSONALITY IN THIS SEAT.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.367
NO, REALLY.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.300
I FEEL VERY...

17:11.333 --> 17:12.300
DULL.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.867
MM-HMM.

17:13.900 --> 17:18.067
YOU WANT ME TO SING
OR YOU WANT THE, UH, RADIO ?

17:18.067 --> 17:20.300
UH, I THINK
I'D RATHER THE RADIO.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.267
ALRIGHT.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.700
( music playing )

17:23.733 --> 17:24.833
WHAT IS THIS,
A TAPE ?

17:24.867 --> 17:26.367
MM-HMM.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH A TAPE ?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.467
I THOUGHT
YOU ONLY BUY CDs.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.333
UM, ACTUALLY A FRIEND
LOANED IT TO ME.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.267
WHO IS THIS ?

17:35.300 --> 17:37.467
IT'S AL GREEN.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.600
WHO GAVE YOU
THIS TAPE ?

17:39.633 --> 17:42.600
BRAD.

17:42.633 --> 17:43.633
IT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT ?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.867
* YOU OUGHTA
BE WITH ME *

17:45.900 --> 17:47.500
"YOU OUGHTA
BE WITH ME" ?

17:47.533 --> 17:48.667
IS THAT WHAT
HE'S SAYING ?

17:48.700 --> 17:51.933
YOU OUGHTA
BE WITH ME.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.467
THAT'S WHAT, THAT'S WHAT
HE'S SINGING ABOUT ?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.867
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU ?

17:55.900 --> 17:56.967
WHAT THE--

17:57.067 --> 17:58.967
WAIT, BRAD
GIVES YOU A TAPE ?

17:59.067 --> 18:01.467
AN AL GREEN TAPE ?

18:01.500 --> 18:02.467
"YOU OUGHTA
BE WITH ME" ?

18:02.500 --> 18:05.633
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I DON'T KNOW...

18:05.667 --> 18:07.533
I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS THING
GETS WORSE EVERY TIME.

18:07.567 --> 18:08.967
NO, LISTEN...

18:09.067 --> 18:12.100
EVERYDAY, THIS STORY IS GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.933
ALRIGHT.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.800
WHAT ABOUT
A NICE BOWL, HUH ?

18:21.833 --> 18:24.200
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY'VE
PROBABLY GOT TONS OF BOWLS.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.633
I MEAN, I'M SURE THEY
WERE REGISTERED SOMEWHERE.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.667
EVERYBODY LIKES A GOOD BOWL
FOR CEREAL AND...

18:28.700 --> 18:31.433
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GONNA
FIND ANYTHING IN HERE.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.600
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE
ALL THIS STUFF, RIGHT ?

18:33.633 --> 18:37.300
DISHES AND STEMWARE,
AND...

18:37.333 --> 18:39.800
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET THEM
A NICE PIECE OF FISH ?

18:39.833 --> 18:42.367
WE SHOULD JUST GO NEXT DOOR
TO THAT WINE SHOP

18:42.400 --> 18:44.300
AND GET AN EXPENSIVE
BOTTLE OF WINE.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.733
LET'S DO THAT.

18:45.767 --> 18:46.533
HOW EXPENSIVE ?

18:46.567 --> 18:49.467
TWO, 250 ?

18:49.500 --> 18:51.800
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S GOT TO BE A GOOD ONE.

18:51.833 --> 18:52.767
'CAUSE THEY'LL KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.133
OH, OF COURSE THEY WILL.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.467
ALRIGHT,
ARE YOU COMING ?

18:55.500 --> 18:58.067
UH, WHAT, BETWEEN THIS
AND A WINE STORE ?

18:58.067 --> 18:59.400
NO, I'LL STAY HERE.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.833
ALRIGHT,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.100
OKAY !

19:06.700 --> 19:07.567
HI.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU FIND ?

19:09.633 --> 19:12.600
OH, UH, NOTHING, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST BROWSING.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.933
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT
BEWILDERED LOOK.

19:14.967 --> 19:16.500
I KNOW IT'S
A LOT TO TAKE IN.

19:16.533 --> 19:17.400
WE'LL JUST, UH...

19:17.433 --> 19:18.467
NO, I'M OKAY.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.967
YOU KNOW,
IF WE NARROW IT DOWN--

19:20.067 --> 19:21.600
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I APPRECIATE IT.

19:21.633 --> 19:23.400
I'M NOT REALLY,
I'M NOT REALLY SHOPPING.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.200
I'M JUST
KIND OF BROWSING.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.333
IF I NEED HELP,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.300
OH, TAKE YOUR TIME.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.067
OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:29.067 --> 19:29.900
GREAT, OKAY.

19:34.067 --> 19:37.300
OH, ALL THE NAPKIN RINGS
IN THE STORE ARE 10% OFF.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.467

19:38.500 --> 19:39.800
NOT JUST THESE,
THERE'S A MILLION MORE.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.067
THEY'RE ALL 10% OFF.

19:41.100 --> 19:41.967
OKAY.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.167
THEY MAKE SUCH
GREAT GIFTS.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.967
OH, WE HAVE, UM,
COME OVER HERE FOR A SECOND.

19:45.067 --> 19:45.900
LET ME SHOW--

19:45.933 --> 19:47.067
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:47.067 --> 19:48.367
I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED
IN BUYING ANYTHING.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.767
BUT THANK YOU.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.400
IF YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE LOW,
SOMETHING MORE AFFORDABLE,

19:52.433 --> 19:54.167
WE HAVE SMALLER ITEMS.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.067
IT'S NOT THAT,
I'M JUST NOT LOOKING.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.700
I'M NOT INTERESTED,
BUT, THANK YOU.

19:57.733 --> 19:59.067
OKAY.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.900
FLATWARE
IS ALWAYS GREAT.

20:03.933 --> 20:04.933
ALRIGHT, LOOK.

20:04.967 --> 20:06.867
CAN YOU STOP FOLLOWING ME
AROUND, PLEASE ?

20:06.900 --> 20:10.067
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN BUYING ANYTHING.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.567
STOP FOLLOWING ME !

20:11.600 --> 20:14.433
UH, I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GIVING YOU THAT IDEA.

20:14.467 --> 20:15.833
ARE YOU,
MAYBE YOU'RE PARANOID.

20:15.867 --> 20:18.467
YOU'VE DONE A COMPLETE CIRCLE
WITH ME NOW IN THE STORE.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.733
WELL, THEN
WHY ARE YOU HERE,

20:19.767 --> 20:21.400
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN BUYING ANYTHING ?

20:21.433 --> 20:23.133
HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF BROWSERS ?

20:23.167 --> 20:25.667
IS THAT WORD UNFAMILIAR TO YOU,
A BROWSER ?

20:25.700 --> 20:27.167
PLEASE LEAVE.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.600
YOU GOT IT.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.200
THANK YOU,
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

20:30.233 --> 20:32.100
I'M WELL
ON THE WAY.

20:36.367 --> 20:40.167
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULD JUST
DROP THIS OFF AT THE LOEBS.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.900
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:41.933 --> 20:43.433
$300.

20:43.467 --> 20:44.467
I KNOW.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.167
SO RIDICULOUS.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.567
BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.967
( cell phone ringing )

20:48.000 --> 20:49.067
HELLO ?

20:49.100 --> 20:51.100
( on speakerphone )
Hey, Cheryl, Brad.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.167
HI, BRAD.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.433
Hey, what's up ?

20:53.467 --> 20:54.533
NOTHING.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.300
LARRY'S IN THE CAR.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.700
Oh, hey,
hey, Larry.

20:58.733 --> 21:00.067
HEY, BRAD.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.067
How you doing ?

21:01.067 --> 21:02.367
PRETTY GOOD.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.267
Hey, Cheryl, still coming
to "Tony and Tina's Wedding" ?

21:04.300 --> 21:05.200
YEAH.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.367
HEY, I'M GOING TOO, BRAD.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.800
Oh, okay, great.

21:08.833 --> 21:11.233
Hey Larry,
still looking for a chef ?

21:11.267 --> 21:14.067
UM, ACTUALLY, I AM.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.067
Well, my friend Paul
is the chef at Alsace

21:16.067 --> 21:17.933
and he's thinking
about leaving.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.600
I KNOW THAT PLACE
ALSACE.

21:19.633 --> 21:20.733
THAT'S A GOOD RESTAURANT.

21:20.767 --> 21:21.967
YEAH.

21:22.067 --> 21:23.067
Hey, you know what ?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.567
Why don't we go eat there
after the show,

21:24.600 --> 21:25.700
and you can
check out the food ?

21:25.733 --> 21:28.433
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.767
Alright, well, uh...

21:29.800 --> 21:30.900
Hey, I'll see you
at the show.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.167
OKAY, BYE.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.433
Take it easy, Cheryl.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.333
"LARRY'S IN THE CAR."

21:39.367 --> 21:41.933
WHAT ?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.700
"LARRY'S IN THE CAR,"
SO, IF YOU, UH,

21:43.733 --> 21:46.333
PLAN ON DOING
ANY DIRTY-TALKING,

21:46.367 --> 21:50.500
BETTER SAVE IT FOR ANOTHER TIME
BECAUSE LARRY'S IN THE CAR.

21:50.533 --> 21:52.100
I WAS JUST
LETTING HIM KNOW.

21:52.133 --> 21:54.067
TO BE POLITE WHEN
YOU'RE ON SPEAKERPHONE,

21:54.067 --> 21:55.067
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW...

21:55.067 --> 21:57.200
OH, YES.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.267
WHO'S LISTENING.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.300
UH-HUH.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.967
I MEAN, I THINK THAT
YOU WOULD BE EXCITED.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.133
HE MIGHT HAVE
FOUND A CHEF.

22:02.167 --> 22:04.233
I ACTUALLY AM, I THINK
THAT COULD BE GOOD.

22:04.267 --> 22:07.067
I'LL CALL TED AND JEFF
AND SET IT UP.

22:07.067 --> 22:07.933
OKAY.

22:07.967 --> 22:10.800
( sirens )

22:10.833 --> 22:12.467
WHAT IS THIS,
OH, MY GOD.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.267
OH, SHIT, THERE'S A COP,
WHAT DO WE DO ?

22:16.300 --> 22:18.100
JUST PULL OVER,
LARRY.

22:18.133 --> 22:21.733
OH, HERE WE GO,
JESUS CHRIST.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.533
WHAT DID
YOU DO ?

22:27.567 --> 22:29.233
LET ME SEE YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE SIR ?

22:29.267 --> 22:31.333
YEAH, CAN I ASK
WHAT I DID ?

22:31.367 --> 22:33.267
SURE CAN.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.267
SIR, WE HAD A REPORT FROM
A YOUNG LADY ON HER CELL PHONE

22:35.300 --> 22:37.200
SAYING YOU'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING HER IN YOUR CAR.

22:37.233 --> 22:39.067
FOLLOWING SOMEONE, WHAT ?

22:39.067 --> 22:41.067
I'M GOING TO DROP OFF
A BOTTLE OF WINE,

22:41.100 --> 22:42.667
IT'S A FRIEND'S HOUSE
IN MORENO.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.067
OKAY, WELL,
WE DID HAVE A--

22:44.067 --> 22:44.933
THIS IS THE GUY.

22:44.967 --> 22:48.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WERE DOING THIS.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.767
THIS GUY CAME INTO
THE STORE WHERE I WORK

22:50.800 --> 22:53.367
AND ACCUSED ME
OF FOLLOWING AROUND,

22:53.400 --> 22:55.633
AND THEN HAD, LIKE,
A LITTLE FREAK-OUT FIT.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.767
AND NOW
HE'S FOLLOWING ME.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.500
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.067
YOU'RE TURNING LEFT
WHEN I'M TURNING LEFT,

23:00.067 --> 23:01.467
YOU'RE TURNING RIGHT
WHEN I'M TURNING RIGHT.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.200
THIS IS, LIKE,
YOUR SICK REVENGE ?

23:03.233 --> 23:04.867
YOU FOLLOW ME AROUND
AND YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT ?

23:04.900 --> 23:05.800
THIS IS
JUST SO IDIOTIC.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.067
WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU ?

23:08.100 --> 23:09.267
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING THIS LADY ?

23:09.300 --> 23:10.600
I'M NOT FOLLOWING HER.

23:10.633 --> 23:13.333
I WAS IN A STORE,
AND SHE WAS FOLLOWING ME.

23:13.367 --> 23:14.300
SHE WAS FOLLOWING ME.

23:14.333 --> 23:15.833
I WAS NOT
FOLLOWING HIM.

23:15.867 --> 23:17.367
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO WORK IN A STORE.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.100
PEOPLE ASK YOU TO LEAVE THEM
ALONE AND YOU HARASS THEM !

23:20.133 --> 23:22.100
FIRST OF ALL
I WAS NOT FOLLOWING YOU !

23:22.133 --> 23:23.233
YOU WERE
SO FOLLOWING ME !

23:23.267 --> 23:24.633
I WAS NOT FOLLOWING YOU,
I WORK THERE.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.767
FOLKS, WE'RE IN A RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD HERE, PLEASE.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.433
LISTEN, WHEN MY HUSBAND
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS,

23:29.467 --> 23:30.467
THERE'S GONNA
BE A PROBLEM.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.433
WHO'S WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND ?

23:31.467 --> 23:32.667
YEAH, YOU ARE,
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU ARE.

23:32.700 --> 23:35.133
SIR, WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY
IN YOUR CAR FOR A MOMENT,

23:35.167 --> 23:36.233
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH YOU.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.067
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE
CALLED FIRST.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.333
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?

23:46.367 --> 23:47.767
I KNOW, BUT DO YOU JUST
DROP BY SOMEBODY'S HOUSE ?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.633
SURE, WHY, YOU GOT A GIFT,
YOU DROP BY.

23:52.067 --> 23:53.200
HELLO.
HEY, MELANIE.

23:53.233 --> 23:53.933
HI.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.733
HEY, ED.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.467
WELL, WE WERE JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.533
OH.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.500
AND THOUGHT WE'D DROP OFF
YOUR WEDDING GIFT.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.333
I'M SORRY IT'S LATE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:03.367 --> 24:05.067
WE CAN'T TAKE YOUR WEDDING,
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

24:05.100 --> 24:05.967
NO.

24:06.067 --> 24:07.600
WE CAN'T TAKE
A WEDDING GIFT NOW.

24:07.633 --> 24:11.067
WE GOT MARRIED
14 MONTHS AGO.

24:11.067 --> 24:13.400
YOU CAN'T GIVE A GIFT
AFTER A YEAR, YOU KNOW THAT.

24:13.433 --> 24:15.367
I KNOW,
THAT'S WHY I'M SORRY.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.867
YOU CAN'T GIVE A GIFT
AFTER A YEAR ?

24:16.900 --> 24:18.300
AND WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER A YEAR ?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.833
YOU JUST CAN'T GIVE IT,
THAT'S THE CUT-OFF.

24:19.867 --> 24:20.933
YOU CAN'T GIVE IT ?

24:20.967 --> 24:22.600
( Cheryl )
YOU CAN GIVE IT
WITH AN APOLOGY.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.300
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL
BOTTLE OF WINE.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.200
WE CAN'T TAKE IT,
YOU KNOW THAT !

24:26.233 --> 24:27.533
IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT,
AND IT'S LATE.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.433
WE JUST SPENT $300 ON
THIS BOTTLE OF WINE FOR YOU

24:30.467 --> 24:31.733
AND YOU'RE NOT
ACCEPTING IT ?!

24:31.767 --> 24:33.067
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME ?

24:33.067 --> 24:34.167
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE GIFT
AFTER A YEAR.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.367
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM

24:35.400 --> 24:37.767
TAKING THE $200
ENGAGEMENT VASE WE GOT YOU.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.333
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
WITH THE SHOWER GIFT.

24:39.367 --> 24:39.933
WHAT'D YOU GET HER ?

24:39.967 --> 24:40.867
THE NIGHTGOWN.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.233
THE NIGHTGOWN,
THAT WAS OKAY.

24:42.267 --> 24:45.933
THEN WE FLEW TO CHICAGO
FOR YOUR LITTLE WEDDING BASH.

24:45.967 --> 24:49.067
YOU'RE INTO US NOW
FOR ABOUT $5,500 AS I SEE IT.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.867
ALRIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,
IT WAS NOT A LITTLE WEDDING.

24:50.900 --> 24:54.167
WE HAD 266 PEOPLE THERE
AND THEN WHY DID YOU COME ?

24:54.200 --> 24:56.400
WHY, BECAUSE SHE PUT A GUN
TO MY HEAD, THAT'S WHY !

24:56.433 --> 24:57.533
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

24:57.567 --> 24:58.767
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT !

24:58.800 --> 25:00.333
YOU CAME 'CAUSE
YOU WANTED TO COME.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.100
OH, YEAH, I WAS DESPERATE
TO GO TO YOUR WEDDING.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.733
IF IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME, LARRY.

25:03.767 --> 25:06.300
OKAY, AND I'M SORRY
THAT YOU CAN'T ACCEPT A GIFT

25:06.333 --> 25:07.867
AFTER 12 MONTHS,
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.200
AND IT'S
THE WAY THINGS ARE.

25:09.233 --> 25:10.367
FINE, OKAY,
THEY DON'T WANT THE WINE.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.333
WE'RE PAST THE CUT-OFF,
WE'RE SORRY.

25:12.367 --> 25:14.067
YOU WOULD DO
THE SAME THING, LARRY.

25:14.067 --> 25:15.400
I KNOW YOU WOULD
DO THE SAME THING.

25:15.433 --> 25:16.733
HEY, BY THE WAY,
DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN THERE

25:16.767 --> 25:18.967
TO CLEAN UP THE MESS
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE RIGHT NOW ?

25:19.067 --> 25:20.900
NO, NO, NO.

25:20.933 --> 25:22.233
THANK YOU !

25:22.267 --> 25:24.300
NEXT TIME CALL.

25:28.567 --> 25:29.667
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS JUST THINKING,

25:29.700 --> 25:31.367
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
WORN A SPORTS COAT.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.900
REALLY, YOU THINK SO,
I MEAN, THAT'S TRUE.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.067
EVERYBODY'S WEARING
A SPORTS JACKET.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.433
WELL, HE'S NOT WEARING
A SPORT JACKET, THAT GUY.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.933
BUT HE MIGHT BE
AN ACTOR.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.600
THAT MIGHT BE PART
OF HIS CHARACTER.

25:39.633 --> 25:40.500
OH.

25:40.533 --> 25:43.533
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,
ACTORS MINGLE.

25:43.567 --> 25:44.833
ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO USE THE BATHROOM.

25:44.867 --> 25:47.233
OKAY, I'LL GRAB A PEW.

25:53.467 --> 25:56.167
HEY, HOW YOU DOING,

25:56.200 --> 25:57.967
ANTOLA,

25:58.067 --> 25:59.067

26:16.767 --> 26:22.167
OH, SHAME SHE'S
GONNA MARRY THAT JERK.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.300
ONLY DOING IT FOR THE MONEY,
SHE DON'T LOVE HIM.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.400
SHE DOESN'T LOVE HIM.

26:27.433 --> 26:30.200
BUT ME AND TINA,
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

26:30.233 --> 26:32.700
WE GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL,
ME AND HER.

26:32.733 --> 26:33.933
OH, DO YOU ?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.300
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
NO ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND, REALLY.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.567
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
A VERY COMPLEX PERSON.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.567
THANK YOU.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.733
WE HAVE A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.400
THAN THAT COCKSUCKER.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.733
THAT COCKSUCKER TONY.

26:45.767 --> 26:46.767
YEAH,
THAT COCKSUCKER.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.467
YEAH,
HE'S A COCKSUCKER, TONY.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.300
YEAH, ONE DAY, ME AND TINA,
WE'LL END UP TOGETHER.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.500
'CAUSE THIS WILL
NEVER WORK.

26:54.533 --> 26:56.533
YEAH, YOU THINK SO ?

26:56.567 --> 26:57.200
OH, YEAH.

26:57.233 --> 26:58.200

26:58.233 --> 26:59.733
THEN I'LL FINALLY
SLIP HER THE SAUSAGE.

26:59.767 --> 27:00.967
OH, IS THAT RIGHT ?

27:01.067 --> 27:01.933
THAT'S RIGHT.

27:01.967 --> 27:03.767
THAT VERY FORMIDABLE
SAUSAGE OF YOURS.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.733
AND SHE WILL BE FOREVER
GRATEFUL, MY FRIEND.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.833
YEAH, IT'S BEEN FUN DOING THIS
LITTLE IMPROV WITH YOU.

27:09.867 --> 27:11.067
IMPROV, WHATEVER YOU

27:11.100 --> 27:13.067
I'LL SEE YOU LATER

27:13.067 --> 27:14.767
AT THE RECEPTION,
