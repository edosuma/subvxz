Vessel <i>Golden Girl,</i>
prepare to be boarded.

00:28.201 --> 00:30.734
That's the first time
I've ever had the cops called

00:30.736 --> 00:32.203
to a party on the ocean.

00:32.205 --> 00:34.104
I-I can't imagine
it's a noise complaint.

00:34.106 --> 00:36.207
Well, we're not the cops,
we're the Coast Guard.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.608
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

00:38.610 --> 00:40.677
Oh. It's
a bachelorette party.

00:40.679 --> 00:43.814
We've just spent the last
ten days cruising South America.

00:43.816 --> 00:45.382
I'm getting married.

00:45.384 --> 00:47.016
Are you aware that
this vessel's been sitting

00:47.018 --> 00:48.385
dead in the water for an hour?

00:48.387 --> 00:49.586
No Mayday call.

00:49.588 --> 00:51.120
No response when
we hailed you.

00:51.122 --> 00:54.524
Uh, sorry.
We were just having fun.

00:54.526 --> 00:56.792
This area of the Gulf
is a known smuggling route.

00:56.794 --> 00:58.328
It's a bad locale for fun.

00:58.330 --> 01:00.830
I'm-I'm sure that
the captain can explain.

01:05.470 --> 01:07.470
Where is he?

01:09.941 --> 01:12.175
We're gonna need
to search the boat.

Special Agent Swanson.

02:06.329 --> 02:07.795
Heard you had a morning.

02:07.797 --> 02:10.064
Just another day
in paradise, Dwayne.

02:10.066 --> 02:12.033
Who's the new guy?
Oh, Sebastian Lund.

02:12.035 --> 02:13.667
Forensic tech.
Agent in training.

02:13.669 --> 02:16.103
Heading over to Georgia
for FLETC soon-- thought we'd

02:16.105 --> 02:18.306
give him some
field experience.

02:19.775 --> 02:21.007
Looking a little green there.

02:21.009 --> 02:23.644
I just... I just need
to get my sea legs.

02:23.646 --> 02:25.045
You know that
we're docked, right?

02:25.047 --> 02:27.080
I do.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.983
Come on.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.086
You got this.
Oh, yeah. It's gonna be great.

02:33.088 --> 02:34.488
<i>The</i> Golden Girl

02:34.490 --> 02:36.222
was on its way back
from a pleasure cruise

02:36.224 --> 02:38.858
of the South American coast--
bachelorette party.

02:38.860 --> 02:40.693
“Girls gone wild” situation.

02:40.695 --> 02:43.330
Not exactly, Christopher.

02:46.701 --> 02:48.501
Loretta.

02:48.503 --> 02:50.103
You beat us here?

02:50.105 --> 02:52.404
Wanted to be able
to tell you things.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.340
Young man is

02:54.342 --> 02:55.808
Daniel Tivoli.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.977
Waiter.
Had his throat slit.

02:57.979 --> 02:59.712
And judging by the
cleanness of the cut,

02:59.714 --> 03:01.213
it wasn't
the killer's first time.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.050
Murder weapon was
a straight razor.

03:06.955 --> 03:08.887
Oh, wow, that's not
just any razor, either.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.590
Hollow ground,
16-millimeter blade,

03:11.592 --> 03:12.791
rounded French point,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.626
three-pin handle.
That's exquisite.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.997
The other victim is the captain.

03:17.999 --> 03:18.895
Jorge Valdo.

03:18.919 --> 03:20.837
Triple tap to the chest.
That's on me.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.684
Remind me not
to piss you off.

03:22.686 --> 03:24.152
Well, I'm glad
you're okay, Swanson.

03:24.154 --> 03:26.119
But I'm wondering why
you brought <i>us</i> here.

03:26.121 --> 03:28.155
The yacht belongs
to Elegance Charters,

03:28.157 --> 03:30.824
a company owned
by one Javier Garcia.

03:30.826 --> 03:34.161
Ciudad Natal Cartel's top man
in New Orleans.

03:34.163 --> 03:36.863
Launders their money.
I know that you've been working

03:36.865 --> 03:39.032
on and off with the FBI
on the cartel case.

03:39.034 --> 03:40.634
Garcia's public enemy
number one.

03:40.636 --> 03:42.669
You can connect him
to the murder?

03:42.671 --> 03:44.905
Not directly,
but maybe to its motive.

03:44.907 --> 03:47.874
<i>I'm guessing the waiter</i>
<i>discovered the captain</i>

03:47.876 --> 03:50.210
and his crew sorting through
whatever used to be in here.

03:50.212 --> 03:51.578
Some kind of a cache.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.913
Yeah, it's common
for drug smugglers.

03:52.915 --> 03:54.547
This one could hold
dozens of keys.

03:54.549 --> 03:55.442
Yeah, but it's empty.

03:55.466 --> 03:56.350
After the waiter
was killed,

03:56.351 --> 03:59.051
I'm guessing someone took
the cargo and the yacht skiff,

03:59.053 --> 04:00.486
left before my team arrived.

04:00.488 --> 04:02.222
Probably headed to the coast.

04:02.224 --> 04:03.523
The captain had two mates.

04:03.525 --> 04:05.658
One's in our custody,
the other's missing.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.628
Connect the drugs directly
to Javier's charter company,

04:08.630 --> 04:10.029
it's a big win.

04:10.031 --> 04:11.598
Christopher,

04:11.600 --> 04:12.898
wrap up here.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.466
Swanson and I'll
go above deck

04:14.468 --> 04:16.836
and start the interviews.

04:16.838 --> 04:18.603
Question the guests.

04:18.606 --> 04:21.373
I'll talk to the suspect,
see if he can...

04:21.375 --> 04:25.010
shed any light
on where this skiff went.

04:25.012 --> 04:26.979
Dwayne Pride?

04:27.815 --> 04:29.481
Oh, thank God.

04:29.483 --> 04:31.149
Eliza, what... Hey.
Thank God.

04:31.151 --> 04:34.620
I am so glad to see
a familiar face.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.655
No one will say
what's going on.

04:36.657 --> 04:38.156
It's okay.
Special Agent Swanson.

04:38.158 --> 04:40.425
Eliza West.
We met a few hours ago.

04:40.427 --> 04:42.193
I didn't realize that
you two knew each other.

04:42.195 --> 04:45.564
Yeah. Mr. Pride is...
my-my guardian angel.

04:45.566 --> 04:47.732
Are you a guest here?

04:47.734 --> 04:50.769
Yeah, this is supposed
to be my party.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.103
I'm getting married.

04:52.105 --> 04:54.839
You'll be receiving
an invitation.

04:54.841 --> 04:57.242
That-that... that's wonderful.

04:57.244 --> 05:00.311
Listen, I need to ask you,
do you know who owns this yacht?

05:00.313 --> 05:01.545
Of course.

05:01.547 --> 05:03.181
My fiancé, Javier.

05:03.183 --> 05:05.149
Javier Garcia's your fiancé?

05:06.218 --> 05:07.485
Congratulations.

05:07.487 --> 05:08.986
Listen, you...

05:08.988 --> 05:10.220
take a seat, okay?

05:10.222 --> 05:11.822
And, um, I'll do
everything I can

05:11.824 --> 05:14.492
to get you guys out of here
as soon as we can.

05:14.494 --> 05:16.394
Thank you.
Yeah.

05:20.833 --> 05:21.999
We're fine.

05:22.001 --> 05:24.301
West as in West
Family Mission?

05:24.303 --> 05:27.537
Her father was murdered in a
carjacking when she was a teen.

05:27.539 --> 05:29.606
I worked the case for JPSO.

05:30.776 --> 05:32.943
Caught the killer. Stayed close.

05:32.945 --> 05:35.378
She is engaged
to the number one target

05:35.380 --> 05:36.913
in the cartel
investigation.

05:36.915 --> 05:39.516
This case just got a whole
lot more complicated.

05:44.022 --> 05:48.491
You want to transfer
permanently to NOLA?

05:48.493 --> 05:50.293
Is this some kind of joke?

05:50.295 --> 05:52.829
No joke, sir.
Field agent slot is available.

05:52.831 --> 05:54.463
I'd like to take it.

05:54.465 --> 05:57.166
I'm-I'm-I'm drowning
in worthless Intel

05:57.168 --> 05:58.600
on Javier Garcia.

05:58.602 --> 06:00.269
I cannot connect him
to laundering money

06:00.271 --> 06:01.770
for the cartels.
I know, sir.

06:01.772 --> 06:03.605
I got two dozen agents
working day and night

06:03.607 --> 06:05.574
to try to find a chink
in his armor.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.776
Timing could be better,
but you've been in D.C.

06:07.778 --> 06:09.011
Dealing with the case
of my career--

06:09.013 --> 06:10.412
and it's supposed
to be yours, too.

06:10.414 --> 06:12.548
Look, I'm not asking for
an immediate transfer.

06:12.550 --> 06:14.279
I'm going to see
this case through.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.752
Tammy,
I've invested in you.

06:16.754 --> 06:18.920
For a bright future.
I mean,

06:18.922 --> 06:20.055
why would you give that up?

06:20.057 --> 06:21.357
Sir...

06:21.359 --> 06:23.726
Special Agent Pride.

06:23.728 --> 06:26.194
You have Isler and Gregorio.
Impress us.

06:26.196 --> 06:27.528
So I just got off a yacht

06:27.530 --> 06:29.664
owned by Javier Garcia

06:29.666 --> 06:31.733
that probably was being used
to smuggle

06:31.735 --> 06:33.268
drugs into New Orleans.

06:33.270 --> 06:34.569
You can prove that?

06:34.571 --> 06:37.239
Interrogated a very
talkative suspect

06:37.241 --> 06:39.507
who confirmed that
he and his partners

06:39.509 --> 06:40.976
were moving contraband.

06:40.978 --> 06:42.310
Who are these partners?

06:42.312 --> 06:44.211
Well, one is-- was...

06:44.213 --> 06:45.446
a Cartel foot soldier,

06:45.448 --> 06:47.147
killed by the Coast Guard.

06:47.149 --> 06:49.049
The other's a man
named Ernesto Blanco.

06:49.051 --> 06:51.352
“Ernesto Blanco.”

06:51.354 --> 06:52.920
He's a Natal lieutenant.

06:52.922 --> 06:55.256
Middleman.
But connected.

06:55.258 --> 06:56.557
You have Blanco in custody?

06:56.559 --> 06:59.093
No, he took off with
the yacht's skip,

06:59.095 --> 07:00.427
along with the contraband.

07:00.429 --> 07:02.263
But our suspect in custody

07:02.265 --> 07:04.564
gave us Blanco's destination.
Lasalle's on his way.

07:04.566 --> 07:05.966
All right, have him come
and get me.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.234
I'll put a team together.

07:07.236 --> 07:09.236
I want Blanco and those drugs

07:09.238 --> 07:11.005
in custody.
Yes, sir.

07:13.042 --> 07:14.708
Oh, this is huge, Pride.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.443
Javier Garcia's
never allowed himself

07:16.445 --> 07:17.977
to be connected to narcotics.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.413
Is there anyone else of interest

07:19.415 --> 07:20.680
on that yacht?

07:20.682 --> 07:22.582
No.

07:22.584 --> 07:24.885
No one important.

07:47.078 --> 07:49.211
That's Ernesto Blanco.

07:49.213 --> 07:51.179
We got agents ready to move
on our say-so.

07:51.181 --> 07:54.949
Coast Guard's got
the waterways blocked too.

07:54.951 --> 07:56.551
We got this guy.

07:58.322 --> 08:00.888
Oh, who's this now?
Well, we'll find out

08:00.890 --> 08:02.190
when we bring them in.

08:02.192 --> 08:04.892
Either one could have
vital information on Javier.

08:05.895 --> 08:07.529
Wait a minute,

08:07.531 --> 08:08.997
they're not smuggling drugs,
that's cash.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.198
Oh, looks like
the mother lode, too.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.432
Probably millions.

08:11.434 --> 08:14.902
Ooh, that changes
everything, Lasalle.

08:14.904 --> 08:17.337
Well, Isler said bring Blanco
and the cargo in, right?

08:17.338 --> 08:19.171
I know, but this money's
being laundered.

08:19.173 --> 08:21.007
This isn't just a drug deal.
We have a chance to see

08:21.009 --> 08:22.875
how Javier's
whole operation works.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.777
You want to pitch it
to Isler first?

08:24.779 --> 08:26.779
Would Pride
pitch it to Isler first?

08:26.781 --> 08:28.680
That's a big fat no.
A'ight.

08:31.519 --> 08:33.251
All agents stand down.

08:33.253 --> 08:35.721
This is no longer a bust,
it's a surveillance operation.

08:35.722 --> 08:39.390
Let's follow the money.

08:40.381 --> 08:43.316
What exactly
are you doing, Gregorio?

08:43.318 --> 08:46.452
Sir, I got a visual
on Ernesto Blanco

08:46.454 --> 08:47.954
and an unknown associate
in a white panel van,

08:47.956 --> 08:50.189
travelling southwest
on River Road.

08:50.191 --> 08:54.193
No, I mean, what exactly
are you doing?

08:54.195 --> 08:56.396
You were supposed to arrest
suspects and seize contraband.

08:56.398 --> 08:58.531
Yeah, we're following millions
in cartel cash.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.433
Probably on its way
to getting laundered.

09:00.435 --> 09:03.436
We got a chance to see how
the sausage gets made, Isler.

09:03.438 --> 09:06.138
Take down Javier red-handed.
Not just his people.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.339
Or you could blow
this whole case.

09:07.341 --> 09:09.207
Now, I'm calling this
little adventure off.

09:09.209 --> 09:10.342
Take them into custody.

09:10.344 --> 09:13.245
Sir, listen...
Now, Gregorio.

09:13.247 --> 09:15.414
Isler?

09:15.416 --> 09:17.615
A minute?

09:17.617 --> 09:19.117
We'll call you back.

09:20.955 --> 09:22.754
You said you'd connect
Ciudad Natal smugglers

09:22.756 --> 09:24.556
to Javier Garcia's yacht.

09:24.558 --> 09:27.525
I expect to see suspects in
cuffs and drugs on the table.

09:27.527 --> 09:29.561
But it's not drugs.
It's cash.

09:29.563 --> 09:31.563
Pride...
We know Javier Garcia's

09:31.565 --> 09:33.134
been laundering money
in New Orleans.

09:33.135 --> 09:34.334
Buying businesses.

09:34.336 --> 09:36.169
Getting a foothold
for the cartel.

09:36.171 --> 09:38.171
We can find out how.

09:39.574 --> 09:40.907
Gregorio should've asked.

09:40.909 --> 09:42.175
She called an audible.

09:42.177 --> 09:43.376
I would've done the same.

09:43.378 --> 09:45.511
Yeah, and that's
what worries me.

09:45.513 --> 09:47.447
D.C.'s expecting a win.

09:47.449 --> 09:48.681
Let's aim high.

09:48.683 --> 09:51.050
Javier in an orange jumpsuit.

09:51.052 --> 09:53.686
The cartel's operation disabled.

09:53.688 --> 09:55.755
Why is Javier Garcia's
fiancée here?

09:56.758 --> 09:58.891
You know about Eliza West?

09:58.893 --> 10:00.760
Her name pops up all over
Garcia's personal life.

10:00.762 --> 10:02.729
Why is she here?

10:02.731 --> 10:04.096
She was on Javier's yacht.

10:04.098 --> 10:05.865
But she doesn't
know anything.

10:05.867 --> 10:08.267
And you were gonna tell this
to me when?

10:08.269 --> 10:11.403
That woman lives with our
target, she knows something.

10:11.405 --> 10:13.705
That woman is a close friend.

10:13.707 --> 10:15.908
I'm asking,

10:15.910 --> 10:17.243
as a courtesy,

10:17.245 --> 10:20.479
let me handle Eliza for now.

10:20.481 --> 10:21.747
We're on a thin ice here, Pride.

10:21.749 --> 10:23.782
Our only advantage
over Javier

10:23.784 --> 10:25.116
is he doesn't
that know we're on to him.

10:25.118 --> 10:26.184
The Coast Guards have his yacht,

10:26.186 --> 10:28.487
you have his fiancée,
our agents

10:28.489 --> 10:29.821
are following his money.

10:29.823 --> 10:31.089
He's not stupid.

10:31.091 --> 10:32.424
He'll figure us out soon.

10:32.426 --> 10:33.825
So we play it tight.

10:33.827 --> 10:37.562
We have Javier come
in for questioning.

10:37.564 --> 10:38.930
We hold him long as we can.

10:38.932 --> 10:40.631
Give Gregorio
and Lasalle time

10:40.633 --> 10:42.533
to track the cash,

10:42.535 --> 10:43.734
see where it goes.

10:43.736 --> 10:46.171
And then arrest Garcia.
Yes.

10:59.786 --> 11:02.320
Oh, Dwayne.

11:02.322 --> 11:05.055
I'd like to call my fiancé.

11:05.057 --> 11:07.358
We already have.
He's on his way.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.994
Can we ask you
some questions?

11:10.996 --> 11:13.496
Well, what can I say?

11:13.498 --> 11:15.699
This was supposed
to be a celebration.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.701
Me and my friends
cutting loose on a cruise.

11:17.703 --> 11:20.437
What made you choose
South America?

11:20.439 --> 11:23.573
It was Javier's idea.
It's where we met.

11:23.575 --> 11:26.409
I was doing charity work in
Colombia for a long time.

11:26.411 --> 11:28.378
Building schools.
And do you know

11:28.380 --> 11:29.679
what Javier does
for a living?

11:29.681 --> 11:31.414
What does Javier's work
have to do with

11:31.416 --> 11:34.116
a waiter being murdered on his boat?
We think the yacht

11:34.118 --> 11:35.952
was being for smuggling.
The waiter

11:35.954 --> 11:37.954
probably saw something
he shouldn't.

11:37.956 --> 11:41.023
And you think it has
something to do with Javier?

11:41.025 --> 11:43.460
Actually...
Just covering our bases.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.662
He's a good man.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.998
You'll like him.
Sure.

11:50.801 --> 11:53.102
Want a cup of tea?

11:53.104 --> 11:54.636
Yeah.

11:54.638 --> 11:56.138
Be right back.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.706
Okay.

11:59.577 --> 12:01.643
She has no idea that
Javier is cartel.

12:01.645 --> 12:04.312
She wouldn't be engaged to him
if she did.

12:05.649 --> 12:07.916
And is there a reason
why we're not telling her?

12:07.918 --> 12:10.051
Javier's dangerous.

12:11.221 --> 12:12.721
He's using her...

12:12.723 --> 12:14.022
for a reason.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.591
I need to find out why.

12:17.895 --> 12:19.961
The less she knows,
the safer she is.

12:19.963 --> 12:22.163
For now, at least.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.476
Oh, I got him.

12:35.478 --> 12:37.044
What exactly is this place?

12:37.046 --> 12:39.480
It's the First Street
Wharf. Trucking depot.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.148
They ship cargo
all over the Southeast.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.778
Probably switching vehicles.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.056
Hey, Patton,
you with us?

12:44.057 --> 12:46.423
Triple P, at your service.

12:46.425 --> 12:48.326
Just got the photos.

12:48.328 --> 12:50.627
Including a beauty shot
of your unknown suspect.

12:50.629 --> 12:52.095
My capable associate
is all over it.

12:52.097 --> 12:53.597
Running the photos
through BRUCE

12:53.599 --> 12:55.265
for facial recognition now.

12:55.267 --> 12:56.633
Swanson, you still with us?

12:56.635 --> 12:58.736
Cartel tried
to take a bite out of me.

12:58.738 --> 13:00.437
Gonna bite back.

13:00.439 --> 13:02.873
Oh, wait, Blanco
and his man are going inside.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.908
We're losing visual.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.177
Depot's got a multiplex
closed circuit security system

13:07.179 --> 13:09.112
on a dedicated server.

13:09.114 --> 13:10.413
Do any of those words
mean you can

13:10.415 --> 13:11.982
give us access to what's inside?

13:11.984 --> 13:14.550
Give me a minute,
I'll be your eyes in the sky.

13:14.552 --> 13:16.819
No, I don't like flying blind.
Ernesto Blanco and that cash

13:16.821 --> 13:18.688
are our only link
to taking Javier down.

13:18.690 --> 13:21.557
Well, Patton's all over it,
all right? We got this.

13:23.561 --> 13:25.160
Special Agent Pride.

13:25.162 --> 13:26.929
Mr. Garcia.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.664
You know each other?

13:28.666 --> 13:30.600
Special Agent Pride
was instrumental

13:30.602 --> 13:32.368
in handling some
unfortunate business

13:32.370 --> 13:35.004
at my son's school
a couple of weeks ago.

13:35.006 --> 13:36.406
How is your son?

13:36.408 --> 13:37.907
Better.

13:37.909 --> 13:39.174
You know why you're here?

13:39.176 --> 13:42.244
A man was murdered on my yacht.

13:42.246 --> 13:43.879
By your crew.

13:43.881 --> 13:46.548
Any idea why?

13:46.550 --> 13:48.517
The <i>Golden Girl</i>
was your charter.

13:48.519 --> 13:50.419
The crew were your employees.

13:50.421 --> 13:52.021
Yes, it's true.

13:52.023 --> 13:54.823
But I don't see to
day-to-day operations.

13:54.825 --> 13:56.959
That's what you said
a couple weeks ago

13:56.961 --> 13:58.527
when your construction company

13:58.529 --> 14:00.896
was responsible
for dumping toxic soil.

14:00.898 --> 14:03.097
The crew...

14:03.099 --> 14:04.800
on your yacht

14:04.802 --> 14:07.068
may have been involved
in smuggling.

14:07.070 --> 14:10.806
You don't seem to have much luck
when it comes to hiring people.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.841
I was warned New Orleans

14:12.843 --> 14:14.842
is a dangerous city.

14:14.844 --> 14:16.610
No, it's proven

14:16.612 --> 14:17.912
to be true.

14:17.914 --> 14:19.480
But my work

14:19.482 --> 14:22.917
and my fiancée are here.

14:24.421 --> 14:26.387
May I see Eliza now?

14:26.389 --> 14:28.022
Not just yet.

14:28.024 --> 14:29.557
<i>Just got an ID</i>

14:29.559 --> 14:32.125
on BRUCE for our
unidentified suspect.

14:33.863 --> 14:36.730
Emile Rojas.
Colombian national.

14:36.732 --> 14:38.398
Sending his résumé your way.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.301
Interpol's been monitoring
this guy for years.

14:41.303 --> 14:42.803
Well, he's connected
to all kind of murders

14:42.805 --> 14:44.071
in South America.

14:44.073 --> 14:45.973
Shootings, stabbings, bombings.

14:45.975 --> 14:49.242
Victims are witnesses,
politicians, drug dealers.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.278
All with one connection
in common.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.645
Ciudad Natal.

14:52.647 --> 14:54.714
Rojas is a <i>sicario.</i> Hit man.

14:54.716 --> 14:56.950
Either Blanco hired him
to take out a target...

14:56.952 --> 14:59.286
Or Blanco <i>is</i> a target.
We need access

14:59.288 --> 15:00.753
to those cameras now.

15:00.755 --> 15:02.089
I got 'em.
They're in a room

15:02.091 --> 15:03.457
in the south side
of the building.

15:03.459 --> 15:04.757
All right, what are they doing?

15:04.759 --> 15:07.794
Talking.
No, something's wrong.

15:07.796 --> 15:09.395
Blanco looks scared.

15:09.397 --> 15:11.564
Oh, damn!

15:11.566 --> 15:13.099
It's a hit! Get in there now!

15:13.101 --> 15:14.501
Let's go!

15:21.775 --> 15:23.476
Dead.

15:23.478 --> 15:24.810
Patton,

15:24.812 --> 15:26.979
where's Rojas?

15:26.981 --> 15:28.247
He's taking
the riverside exit.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.616
Cash must be still in the van.

15:39.459 --> 15:41.627
We lost him.

15:44.665 --> 15:46.865
Everything all right?

15:48.435 --> 15:50.101
Never better.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.603
But I'm afraid
an urgent

15:51.605 --> 15:53.371
business matter
has just

15:53.373 --> 15:55.040
come up that...

15:55.042 --> 15:56.874
requires my full attention.

15:56.876 --> 15:58.209
I'm going to collect Eliza now.

15:58.211 --> 15:59.677
We're not done
asking you questions

15:59.679 --> 16:00.978
about the crew of your yacht.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.647
But I have nothing left to say.

16:02.649 --> 16:04.916
So unless I'm being detained
for some reason,

16:04.918 --> 16:07.085
I assume I'm free to go.

16:09.222 --> 16:11.022
Of course.

16:17.496 --> 16:19.830
Do you think he knows
how cornered he is right now?

16:19.832 --> 16:21.999
Honestly...

16:22.001 --> 16:24.001
I can't tell.

16:24.003 --> 16:26.370
We got a situation.
Blanco was just killed

16:26.372 --> 16:29.173
by a cartel hit man.
He got away with the cash.

16:29.175 --> 16:31.341
Damn it.

16:49.818 --> 16:52.889
Start of the day, we had cartel
lieutenant Ernesto Blanco,

16:52.890 --> 16:54.389
millions in drug money
and a foothold

16:54.391 --> 16:56.024
in the Javier Garcia
investigation.

16:56.026 --> 16:57.625
Now Blanco's dead,

16:57.627 --> 17:00.262
the cash is gone
and Javier's walking free.

17:00.264 --> 17:02.263
Emile Rojas is
a cartel hit man.

17:02.265 --> 17:04.198
He killed Blanco, took the cash,
probably on Javier's orders

17:04.200 --> 17:06.267
after the Coast Guard
seized his yacht.

17:06.269 --> 17:07.535
And where's Rojas now?

17:07.537 --> 17:08.803
In the wind.

17:08.805 --> 17:10.438
Which leaves us where?

17:10.440 --> 17:12.640
I'll tell you where:
screwed.

17:12.642 --> 17:14.809
Rojas is the key here.

17:14.810 --> 17:15.843
Track him down,

17:15.845 --> 17:17.310
scoop him and the money up.

17:17.313 --> 17:19.479
It's what we do, sir.
No, it's what

17:19.481 --> 17:21.647
<i>he</i> does. What we do

17:21.650 --> 17:22.983
is protocol and procedure.

17:22.984 --> 17:24.617
Or we did, until you came south.

17:24.619 --> 17:27.320
Look, I know I messed up.
But we got a real shot

17:27.323 --> 17:29.857
at wrapping Javier up for good.
Had.

17:29.859 --> 17:31.859
No, I... I blame myself.

17:31.861 --> 17:33.727
I let you two
take initiative.

17:33.729 --> 17:34.994
It won't happen again.

17:34.996 --> 17:36.530
You're sitting
this out, Gregorio.

17:36.532 --> 17:37.997
What?

17:37.999 --> 17:39.733
It's as much my case
as it is yours.

17:39.735 --> 17:41.868
Not anymore.
Go back to the office.

17:41.870 --> 17:44.738
Sir, I...
Thank you, Gregorio.

17:54.249 --> 17:56.015
Don't even start.

17:56.017 --> 17:58.251
Gregorio's a good agent.
We need her.

17:58.253 --> 18:00.019
The FBI, NCIS

18:00.021 --> 18:01.988
and the Coast Guard
are working the case.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.356
That's plenty of manpower.

18:03.358 --> 18:05.424
Well, you're the boss.

18:06.994 --> 18:08.627
What is that supposed to mean?

18:08.629 --> 18:10.496
Just acknowledging
your leadership.

18:10.498 --> 18:12.264
Well, you never have before.

18:12.266 --> 18:13.833
Got to work together here.

18:13.835 --> 18:16.034
Okay.

18:16.036 --> 18:18.303
Let's go find that
missing cash.

18:23.677 --> 18:26.711
First Street Wharf ships cargo
all over the Southeast.

18:26.713 --> 18:28.780
Dozens of trucks come
and go by the hour,

18:28.782 --> 18:30.515
moving tons of freight.

18:30.517 --> 18:32.650
We cross-referenced manifests
with deliveries

18:32.652 --> 18:34.819
to or from
Javier Garcia's businesses.

18:34.821 --> 18:36.121
Assuming you haven't
found a connection,

18:36.123 --> 18:37.422
or we'd be on our way.

18:37.424 --> 18:39.724
No. We have a connection.

18:39.726 --> 18:41.926
It's just not to Javier.

18:43.229 --> 18:44.863
River Run Ranch.

18:44.865 --> 18:46.464
The truck from the depot
headed there this afternoon.

18:46.466 --> 18:47.965
Well, if the ranch
isn't connected to Javier,

18:47.967 --> 18:49.434
then who's it connected to?

18:52.873 --> 18:54.906
Javier's fiancée.

18:54.908 --> 18:56.908
Eliza West.

18:56.910 --> 18:58.342
I'm pulling a warrant.

18:58.344 --> 19:01.245
Eliza is not involved
in cartel business.

19:01.247 --> 19:03.014
Then she'll have nothing
to hide.

19:09.923 --> 19:11.522
Dwayne, what is going on?

19:11.524 --> 19:13.023
It's just a
routine search.

19:13.025 --> 19:14.925
Routine for who?

19:14.927 --> 19:16.192
Do you know this man?

19:17.262 --> 19:18.462
Yes.

19:18.464 --> 19:21.432
He was a mate
on Javier's yacht.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.233
Is he in trouble?

19:23.235 --> 19:24.401
He's dead.

19:24.403 --> 19:26.637
We think the man
who killed him

19:26.639 --> 19:29.172
came here with some evidence
we're searching for.

19:29.174 --> 19:30.807
What kind of evidence?

19:30.809 --> 19:32.608
Millions of dollars in cash.

19:34.479 --> 19:35.979
We raise horses here

19:35.981 --> 19:38.381
and train them,
we're not hiding any money.

19:38.383 --> 19:40.683
Don't think it's your money.
It's your fiancé's.

19:41.686 --> 19:43.553
Javier keeps his money
in the bank

19:43.555 --> 19:44.754
just like everyone else.

19:44.756 --> 19:47.890
So are you going to tell her
or am I?

19:52.063 --> 19:54.163
Have you heard of
the Ciudad Natal?

19:54.165 --> 19:56.866
Colombian drug cartel.

19:57.669 --> 19:59.001
In the newspaper.

19:59.003 --> 20:00.670
Javier Garcia's
one of their leaders.

20:02.406 --> 20:05.740
This is ridiculous.

20:06.610 --> 20:08.743
It's true, Eliza.

20:13.384 --> 20:15.985
Javier is an investor.

20:15.987 --> 20:18.820
He owns some motels,
a construction company.

20:18.822 --> 20:19.855
That's all.

20:19.857 --> 20:22.056
I know this is a lot to take in.

20:22.058 --> 20:25.326
He partnered with
my family foundation

20:25.328 --> 20:26.695
to give back to
the community.

20:26.697 --> 20:28.062
He is not

20:28.064 --> 20:29.731
a drug dealer.

20:32.235 --> 20:34.202
We got something here.

20:36.572 --> 20:39.107
Maybe around $3 million.

20:39.109 --> 20:41.876
Lasalle and Gregorio
saw a lot more.

20:41.878 --> 20:43.511
That's enough.

20:45.281 --> 20:47.548
I have no idea
where that came from.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.550
From drug trafficking,
Ms. West.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.185
That's, uh, blood money.

20:53.055 --> 20:54.755
It-- this can't be true.

20:54.757 --> 20:58.726
Well, we'll figure it out
back at my office.

20:58.728 --> 21:00.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
am I being arrested?

21:00.095 --> 21:01.829
No one's under arrest.

21:01.831 --> 21:02.930
Not yet, at least.

21:02.932 --> 21:04.131
Ms. West, do you have a jacket?

21:04.133 --> 21:05.465
One of my agents
will get it for you.

21:05.467 --> 21:08.002
Dwayne, what is happening?

21:08.004 --> 21:09.069
Just wait.

21:09.071 --> 21:10.003
Isler...

21:10.005 --> 21:11.104
Hey, this isn't
up for debate.

21:11.106 --> 21:12.138
She's coming in now.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.773
Now, we tried it your way
this morning

21:13.775 --> 21:15.041
and it blew up in our faces.

21:15.043 --> 21:16.576
She's a person of interest.

21:16.578 --> 21:17.744
Eliza's not stupid.

21:17.746 --> 21:19.445
Push her, she'll call
the family lawyer.

21:19.447 --> 21:21.014
Then what do you suggest?

21:21.016 --> 21:23.349
I've known the girl 20 years.
She trusts me.

21:23.351 --> 21:24.617
Let me speak to her.

21:24.619 --> 21:28.087
We'll find out
everything she knows.

21:32.226 --> 21:34.793
Come on.
Come on.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.598
This is a bad man.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.233
Drug dealer, killer.

21:41.235 --> 21:42.435
God knows what else.

21:42.437 --> 21:44.370
Whew. Remind me not to ask you

21:44.372 --> 21:46.471
to write a eulogy
when my time comes.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.574
If it wasn't for me,
he'd still be alive.

21:48.576 --> 21:50.542
In custody, possibly

21:50.544 --> 21:51.777
informing
on Javier Garcia.

21:51.779 --> 21:52.945
You feel responsible?

21:52.947 --> 21:54.312
I am responsible.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.481
I acted impulsively,
someone died.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.150
Okay.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.220
Then do something about it.
You can't fix what's broken

22:02.222 --> 22:04.122
standing around feeling
sorry for yourself.

22:04.124 --> 22:06.657
Is that the kind of tough love
you give Pride?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.359
All the time.

22:08.361 --> 22:09.994
All right, so
I got something.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.162
Hope it's good.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.497
There were traces

22:12.499 --> 22:14.099
of a white residue
on the garrote

22:14.101 --> 22:15.433
used to kill Blanco.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.235
I figured it could
give us a clue

22:17.237 --> 22:19.937
as to where our killer's
been or where he's going.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.505
See, this is Chinese drywall.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.173
It's part of a huge
batch of shoddy

22:23.175 --> 22:24.842
building supplies
that were used after Katrina.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.210
I remember.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.112
Builders all over the city
were involved.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.280
I thought most of the
drywall was disposed of.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.382
There's at least one
building project in New Orleans

22:32.384 --> 22:34.985
that still stands.
Abandoned years ago.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.019
How do you know?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.155
My ex-husband was the developer.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.624
When the scandal hit,
he skipped town,

22:40.626 --> 22:42.593
building was condemned,
and no one had the money

22:42.595 --> 22:45.762
to tear it down.
It just sits there.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.298
Man, New Orleans' own
mini Chernobyl.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.367
An excellent hideout
for a fugitive.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.169
I'll call Lasalle
and check it out.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.438
Come on, Sebastian.
Mm.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.873
Time for some more
field work.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.307
Oh.

23:01.412 --> 23:03.346
The cartel is building
a foundation.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.881
Legitimate companies

23:04.883 --> 23:06.883
give them the ability
to wield influence.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.818
Your family is one of the most
respected in New Orleans.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.554
If he marries you,

23:11.556 --> 23:13.556
it gives him access
to politicians,

23:13.558 --> 23:15.358
to decision makers.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.261
A cynical way
of looking at life.

23:21.832 --> 23:23.699
You were so young...

23:23.701 --> 23:25.834
when your father was killed.

23:27.171 --> 23:30.572
I made a promise to you
back then. You remember?

23:30.574 --> 23:33.575
You promised to find
the men responsible.

23:33.577 --> 23:36.979
And you did.

23:36.981 --> 23:39.982
Also said that you would
always look out for me.

23:39.984 --> 23:42.016
Exactly.

23:42.018 --> 23:44.252
That's why I'm gonna
show you these.

23:47.191 --> 23:50.225
Victims of the
Ciudad Natal.

23:50.227 --> 23:53.027
Cost of doing business.

23:53.029 --> 23:55.330
That's who Javier
really is.

23:55.332 --> 23:57.531
He wants to do

23:57.533 --> 24:00.034
to New Orleans what he's
already done to Bogota.

24:04.273 --> 24:07.641
Help me, Eliza.

24:07.643 --> 24:11.679
Help me take
down this man

24:11.681 --> 24:14.515
and protect our city.

24:14.517 --> 24:17.117
Your father's legacy.

24:26.295 --> 24:28.929
What do I have to do?

24:45.110 --> 24:48.478
According to Eliza, Javier's
secretive about work.

24:48.915 --> 24:52.783
Handles all the banking
and books himself.

24:52.785 --> 24:55.986
Spends his days dealing
with business, and his evenings

24:55.988 --> 24:57.654
with Eliza and his son.

24:57.656 --> 25:00.391
Sometimes attending charity
events around the city.

25:00.393 --> 25:02.426
Please say
that's not all you have.

25:02.428 --> 25:04.561
Javier's an embed.

25:04.563 --> 25:05.996
He was sent to blend in.

25:05.998 --> 25:07.631
He's not burying bodies
in his yard.

25:07.633 --> 25:09.365
He's careful.

25:09.367 --> 25:11.701
Eliza was there when Ernesto
Blanco murdered an innocent man

25:11.703 --> 25:13.202
on Javier's yacht.

25:13.204 --> 25:16.372
She had three million
in cartel cash at her stables.

25:16.374 --> 25:19.142
He's not that careful. Now, I'm
trying to work with you, Pride.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.377
You said you could talk
to her and get her to cooperate.

25:21.379 --> 25:22.879
I need more.

25:22.881 --> 25:25.848
Javier has an office
in the house.

25:25.850 --> 25:27.417
A computer with
a dedicated server

25:27.419 --> 25:29.052
where he handles
all his business.

25:29.054 --> 25:31.054
If there's a smoking gun,
it's on that server.

25:31.056 --> 25:32.822
Can we hack it?
Patton tried.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.425
It's Fort Knox. NSA-level
intrusion detection system,

25:35.427 --> 25:38.261
firewalls, breach protection.

25:38.263 --> 25:40.563
If we want access, it has to be
someone on the inside.

25:40.565 --> 25:43.599
Not someone. Eliza.
She's our only option.

25:43.601 --> 25:45.067
She lives with Javier,
and he trusts her.

25:45.069 --> 25:47.470
He's using her
for her name and connections.

25:47.472 --> 25:50.639
He discovers she's cooperating
with us, what'll he do?

25:50.641 --> 25:52.040
You have a better option?

25:52.042 --> 25:54.042
Emile Rojas.

25:54.044 --> 25:57.346
The cartel <i>sicario</i> sent in to
clean up the mess on the yacht.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.847
He killed Ernesto Blanco

25:58.849 --> 26:00.949
and took off with the rest
of the smuggled cash.

26:00.951 --> 26:05.420
We get him and the money, we can
leverage him to give up Javier.

26:05.422 --> 26:07.689
It's possible we can
take down the cartel

26:07.691 --> 26:09.157
without putting Eliza at risk.

26:09.159 --> 26:11.426
What's with you and this girl?

26:11.428 --> 26:15.329
Made a promise to her years ago
to keep her safe,

26:15.331 --> 26:17.966
and I intend to honor it.

26:19.235 --> 26:21.603
Any idea where Rojas is?

26:21.605 --> 26:23.304
Lasalle's running down a lead.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.908
Okay.

26:26.910 --> 26:30.644
But if you can't locate him
soon, Eliza's on deck.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.453
<i>I checked the perimeter</i>

26:39.455 --> 26:41.622
of this place. There's no sign
of life anywhere.

26:41.624 --> 26:43.491
If Rojas was here,
he's gone by now.

26:43.493 --> 26:45.326
Well, let's go in
and check it out.

26:45.328 --> 26:47.995
Oh, good idea. Weapon,
in case I need to defend myself.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.898
Flashlight... in case
you need to see.

27:03.811 --> 27:06.712
You smell that?
I smell

27:06.714 --> 27:08.147
so many different things
right now,

27:08.149 --> 27:10.149
you got to be
a little more specific.

27:10.151 --> 27:11.917
Like someone
recently lit a fire.

27:11.919 --> 27:14.786
I got something here.

27:24.865 --> 27:27.331
Guess he's been staying here.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.300
Bathing here, too.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.539
Oh, my...

27:37.477 --> 27:39.678
Guess we found our missing cash.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.446
I'll let Chris know.

27:59.765 --> 28:00.664
Drop the... drop the knife!

28:00.666 --> 28:01.999
Shoot him!

28:02.001 --> 28:04.935
Shoot him already!

28:13.713 --> 28:16.480
You all right?

28:16.482 --> 28:17.780
Fine.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.253
It's over.

28:23.255 --> 28:25.922
Lower the weapon, baby.

28:37.869 --> 28:40.336
<i>Was anyone else hurt?</i>

28:40.338 --> 28:42.438
Gregorio got some
bumps and bruises.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.007
Wondering what
she was doing there

28:44.009 --> 28:46.208
in the first place.
I benched her.

28:46.210 --> 28:48.010
She wanted
to see the case through.

28:48.012 --> 28:50.179
So,

28:50.181 --> 28:52.181
our one suspect is dead,

28:52.183 --> 28:54.916
the rest of the cartel cash
is in ashes.

28:54.918 --> 28:57.453
We need Eliza to access
Javier's computer.

28:57.455 --> 29:00.656
Javier brought a trained
assassin to clean house

29:00.658 --> 29:03.492
and destroy millions
in drug money.

29:03.494 --> 29:05.761
Probably 'cause he
knows we're on to him.

29:05.763 --> 29:07.095
What do you think
he'll do to her

29:07.097 --> 29:08.530
if he finds out
she's cooperating?

29:08.532 --> 29:10.932
And how many others die
if we let him go, Pride?

29:10.934 --> 29:13.101
I won't put Eliza in danger.

29:13.103 --> 29:15.671
It's not your choice.

29:19.442 --> 29:21.509
Ever since my
father was killed,

29:21.511 --> 29:24.979
my family and I have
tried to help people,

29:24.981 --> 29:27.315
to do the right thing.

29:27.317 --> 29:28.949
You know what we're asking?

29:28.951 --> 29:33.621
You want me
to copy his hard drive.

29:33.623 --> 29:35.557
Just show me how.

29:35.559 --> 29:38.793
We'll walk you through
every step.

29:38.795 --> 29:41.628
Well, we better hurry.
Um, Javier's expecting me

29:41.630 --> 29:42.997
for dinner.
Eliza.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.298
Dwayne.

29:44.300 --> 29:47.634
I won't let anybody
else get hurt.

29:47.636 --> 29:51.405
I can handle this.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.882
Special Agent Pride.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.751
Please come in.

30:04.753 --> 30:07.053
Hope it's all right
that I drop by.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.439
I...

30:08.440 --> 30:09.946
I wanted to
apologize.

30:10.093 --> 30:11.726
For what?

30:11.727 --> 30:13.693
How you were
treated yesterday.

30:13.695 --> 30:15.095
FBI's not much
on courtesy.

30:15.097 --> 30:16.629
It's not how
I would have handled things.

30:16.631 --> 30:20.166
Especially
since you're engaged to Eliza.

30:20.168 --> 30:22.568
Dwayne.

30:22.570 --> 30:26.439
I was surprised to find out
you knew each other, but

30:26.441 --> 30:28.874
New Orleans is
such a small city.

30:28.876 --> 30:31.810
It's the biggest small town
in America.

30:31.812 --> 30:36.115
Oh, it's one of my
personal favorites for you.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.354
We must try it.

30:41.356 --> 30:44.156
Uh, sounds good to me.

30:44.158 --> 30:46.391
I'll find some proper
whiskey glasses.

30:46.393 --> 30:48.060
Excuse me.

30:51.966 --> 30:54.032
Wow.

30:54.034 --> 30:56.168
This is a
beautiful home.

30:57.271 --> 30:59.304
Arts and Crafts.

30:59.306 --> 31:01.306
Right off the avenue.

31:01.308 --> 31:03.375
Very New Orleans.

31:03.377 --> 31:06.578
It reminds Eliza
of her family home.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.647
I wanted to make her
feel comfortable.

31:19.292 --> 31:21.058
Okay, I'm in.

31:21.060 --> 31:22.426
What do I do?

31:22.428 --> 31:24.728
Okay, take a deep breath,

31:24.730 --> 31:27.498
strap in and let's
boot that puppy up.

31:30.136 --> 31:32.303
Okay.

31:33.673 --> 31:35.472
It's asking for a password.

31:35.474 --> 31:37.040
Insert the thumb drive.

31:37.042 --> 31:39.276
My packet sniffer will access
the security protocol,

31:39.278 --> 31:41.178
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

31:47.586 --> 31:49.786
Okay. Desktop is up.

31:49.788 --> 31:51.121
Listen.

31:51.123 --> 31:52.823
There's still multiple
fail-safes here.

31:52.825 --> 31:55.192
One wrong command,
and it'll send a message

31:55.194 --> 31:56.726
straight to Javier's phone.

31:56.728 --> 31:59.029
W-Wait. Did you just say,
“one wrong command”?

31:59.031 --> 32:00.630
Don't worry about that.

32:00.632 --> 32:02.165
Just listen to me.

32:02.167 --> 32:03.499
I'm gonna tell you
what to type.

32:03.501 --> 32:05.202
All right? All caps.

32:05.204 --> 32:09.939
CDW CS2, forward slash.

32:09.941 --> 32:13.209
Now hit “enter.”

32:18.282 --> 32:20.583
You know, you got
a beautiful yacht, too.

32:20.585 --> 32:24.320
I... I'm hoping to get it back
to you soon.

32:24.322 --> 32:26.288
Is that possible?

32:26.290 --> 32:28.757
I mean, know it's...
it's a crime scene, and...

32:28.759 --> 32:31.894
Well... I'll shake a few trees.

32:31.896 --> 32:33.562
I'd appreciate it.

32:33.564 --> 32:35.397
Mm.

32:36.467 --> 32:38.600
I'm sorry to-to
keep you waiting.

32:38.602 --> 32:40.435
I'm... I'm going
to go find Eliza.

32:40.437 --> 32:42.371
Okay.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.653
It's taking forever.
Is this normal?

32:59.655 --> 33:00.688
Eliza?

33:02.959 --> 33:04.799
Javier's coming,
I'm out of time.

33:06.396 --> 33:08.897
Eliza? Where are you?

33:08.899 --> 33:10.531
Okay, she can remove
the drive now, we'll get

33:10.533 --> 33:11.766
- most of the files.
- If she pull it now,

33:11.768 --> 33:13.033
we'll lose everything.

33:16.606 --> 33:18.739
Eliza?

33:24.179 --> 33:26.113
Uh...

33:27.364 --> 33:28.079
Got it.

33:28.103 --> 33:30.103
Okay, hurry,
get out of there.

33:38.961 --> 33:40.460
Sorry.

33:40.462 --> 33:43.964
I wanted to find the crystal.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.735
Oh... good idea.

33:50.305 --> 33:51.471
But only two glasses?

33:51.473 --> 33:54.073
Oh, uh, I can't stay.

33:54.943 --> 33:57.076
I'm already late for a--

33:57.078 --> 33:58.912
a board meeting for
the family trust.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.079
Tonight?

34:01.682 --> 34:03.482
I mean, even after everything
you've been through?

34:03.484 --> 34:05.684
Duty calls.

34:05.686 --> 34:07.920
I'm sure you understand, Dwayne.

34:07.922 --> 34:08.754
Of course.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.489
Maybe I should come with you.

34:11.492 --> 34:13.492
Oh, no, no.

34:13.494 --> 34:15.161
That's very sweet.

34:17.665 --> 34:18.996
I'll be okay.

34:29.009 --> 34:30.476
Shall we?

34:48.761 --> 34:49.995
I don't know about you,

34:49.996 --> 34:52.196
but I could use a drink.

35:00.607 --> 35:02.573
Everything all right?

35:03.442 --> 35:05.409
Never better.

35:23.023 --> 35:24.889
Sebastian?

35:26.560 --> 35:27.993
You all right?

35:30.059 --> 35:33.060
Yeah. Pulse is normal,
I'm breathing regular.

35:33.062 --> 35:34.362
There's not a thing
wrong with me.

35:34.364 --> 35:37.432
Why do you look like
someone just died?

35:37.434 --> 35:39.000
Because Tammy almost did.

35:39.002 --> 35:40.502
It's my fault.

35:40.504 --> 35:42.503
It's Emile Rojas's fault.

35:42.505 --> 35:43.905
All right? He's dead.

35:43.907 --> 35:45.907
Tammy's back at FBI.

35:45.909 --> 35:46.941
But she was in trouble.

35:46.943 --> 35:48.242
All right, and I--
I could've helped her,

35:48.244 --> 35:50.744
but I froze up, I was a-afraid
of missing the shot.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.446
Which is why you didn't take it.

35:55.484 --> 35:57.251
I'm not ready to be
a field agent.

35:57.253 --> 35:58.752
Of course not.

35:58.754 --> 36:01.522
That's what training is for.

36:01.524 --> 36:03.724
Don't ever give up.

36:03.726 --> 36:06.192
All right, but keep doing
what you do best,

36:06.194 --> 36:08.228
because right now,
we need you.

36:09.097 --> 36:11.197
Well, I'm gonna

36:11.199 --> 36:12.999
process all the evidence
we got from Rojas's hideout,

36:13.001 --> 36:16.036
try to find some connection
to Garcia.

36:16.038 --> 36:17.270
Adios.

36:17.272 --> 36:18.738
All right, see you, buddy.

36:27.749 --> 36:29.449
You all right?

36:31.352 --> 36:32.585
Surprised Isler let you
back in the building

36:32.587 --> 36:34.320
after disobeying
his orders.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.889
Getting Javier's files put him
in a forgiving vein.

36:36.891 --> 36:38.658
Hmm. Where is he now?

36:38.660 --> 36:40.626
With the forensic accountants,
sorting through the files.

36:40.628 --> 36:42.695
We're hitting Javier
tonight, before he realizes

36:42.697 --> 36:44.063
that we got access
to his computer.

36:44.065 --> 36:45.598
Take out his whole operation.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.833
You should come.

36:46.835 --> 36:48.533
Yeah, well, I...

36:49.770 --> 36:51.203
I'll leave it to pros.

36:54.375 --> 36:55.540
Hey.

36:56.444 --> 36:58.243
Hey...

36:58.245 --> 37:00.045
What you did tonight...

37:01.282 --> 37:02.681
...helped a lot of people.

37:05.185 --> 37:06.852
Thank you.

37:06.854 --> 37:10.288
You stopped me from
making a horrible mistake.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.958
Saved my family's name.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.526
Looked out for me,

37:14.528 --> 37:15.961
the way you always have.

37:17.297 --> 37:18.730
Gonna be hard for a while.

37:18.732 --> 37:21.265
FBI will take you
to a safe house

37:21.267 --> 37:22.833
until Javier
and his organization

37:22.835 --> 37:24.369
are dismantled.

37:24.371 --> 37:26.004
I'll get you home
as soon as I can.

37:26.973 --> 37:29.073
Okay.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.542
Thank you.

37:31.544 --> 37:33.044
Yeah.

37:35.815 --> 37:38.448
Well, I guess this is my ride.

37:38.450 --> 37:41.385
Yeah. Thanks, fellas.

37:43.055 --> 37:44.755
You're gonna be okay.

37:46.592 --> 37:48.191
Yeah.

37:50.897 --> 37:52.596
All right. Pride.

37:52.598 --> 37:54.831
We got an issue.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.569
Something wrong
with Javier's files?

37:59.571 --> 38:01.338
Oh, they're in perfect order.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.606
Hundreds of pages of data
on Javier's business.

38:03.608 --> 38:05.642
A dozen companies,
$50 million in assets,

38:05.644 --> 38:06.976
enough to bury
whoever's in charge.

38:06.978 --> 38:07.877
Then what's wrong?

38:07.879 --> 38:09.946
None of it connects to Javier.

38:09.948 --> 38:10.880
What?

38:10.882 --> 38:12.348
Every company, every account

38:12.350 --> 38:13.550
has Eliza's name on it.

38:13.552 --> 38:14.517
Or one of her relatives.

38:14.519 --> 38:15.685
Well, how is that possible?

38:15.687 --> 38:17.253
The stables.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.922
Javier made Eliza
the sole proprietor.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.857
Every one of his businesses
leads back to it,

38:20.859 --> 38:22.458
or another of
the West family holdings.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.827
Perfect setup to cover himself.

38:24.829 --> 38:26.128
We can take down
the businesses,

38:26.130 --> 38:28.264
but we can't link him
to any wrongdoing.

38:28.266 --> 38:29.865
Javier's free and clear.

38:32.970 --> 38:35.104
Sebastian,
I can't talk right now.

38:35.106 --> 38:36.305
Then I'll do the talking.

38:36.307 --> 38:37.973
I-I analyzed the evidence
that we got

38:37.975 --> 38:40.042
from Rojas's hideout
for DNA and fingerprints--

38:40.044 --> 38:42.010
that place was a petri dish
of biologicals.

38:42.012 --> 38:43.344
Rojas is dead.

38:43.346 --> 38:45.013
We already know he was a hit man
for the cartel, so...

38:45.015 --> 38:46.582
Right, but he wasn't
the only one.

38:46.584 --> 38:48.550
I found DNA of a second <i>sicario</i>

38:48.552 --> 38:49.551
all over that hideout.

38:49.553 --> 38:50.786
A-A Marcos Velasco.

38:50.788 --> 38:52.454
And according to deleted texts

38:52.456 --> 38:53.956
that I got off of Rojas's phone,

38:53.958 --> 38:55.490
his target is Eliza West.

38:57.061 --> 38:58.894
Pride, are you there?

39:14.511 --> 39:15.843
Dwayne?

39:15.845 --> 39:18.212
Have them turn the SUV around
right now!

39:18.214 --> 39:20.147
You're not safe!
What are you talking about?

39:40.102 --> 39:41.468
Eliza!

39:47.009 --> 39:49.475
Oh, no. No!

39:49.477 --> 39:51.444
Eliza... it's...

39:52.447 --> 39:54.614
it's-- it's-- it's okay.

39:57.352 --> 39:59.352
Oh, no.

39:59.354 --> 40:02.122
Oh...

40:22.609 --> 40:25.010
Eliza West's dead.

40:25.012 --> 40:28.280
Along with three agents.

40:28.282 --> 40:30.883
Our entire case
against Javier Garcia

40:30.885 --> 40:32.151
has fallen apart.

40:32.153 --> 40:33.886
Gregorio?

40:33.888 --> 40:35.554
Do you hear me?

40:35.556 --> 40:39.191
Sir, we can still dismantle
his laundering operation.

40:39.193 --> 40:41.926
Not “we,” Gregorio.

40:41.928 --> 40:43.728
If D.C. can't have Javier's head
on a pike,

40:43.730 --> 40:44.796
they want one of ours.

40:44.798 --> 40:46.130
I did what I thought was best.

40:46.132 --> 40:47.832
And I stand by
the calls I made.

40:47.834 --> 40:49.334
Then you stand alone.

40:49.336 --> 40:51.035
You went rogue.

40:51.037 --> 40:53.137
Disobeyed my orders.
Twice.

40:53.139 --> 40:55.573
It's unacceptable.

40:55.575 --> 40:58.375
Your career...

40:58.377 --> 41:00.044
is over.

41:24.670 --> 41:27.137
It's a little early
in the day, King.

41:29.208 --> 41:32.809
I was with the West family
last night.

41:34.446 --> 41:37.047
Trying to explain
what happened to Eliza.

41:38.717 --> 41:40.550
Well, it's not your fault.

41:40.552 --> 41:42.886
But it is, Christopher.

41:44.822 --> 41:47.557
I promised that girl
I'd keep her safe.

41:47.559 --> 41:48.991
I failed.
Simple as that.

41:52.564 --> 41:55.831
Well, there's nothing you can do
sometimes.

41:56.801 --> 41:59.235
There's something I can do.

41:59.237 --> 42:01.771
I can make Javier pay.

42:05.943 --> 42:08.277
He used Eliza for cover,

42:08.279 --> 42:11.147
and then had her killed
when we got too close.

42:11.149 --> 42:14.150
And he's not
getting away with it.

42:14.152 --> 42:16.051
How?

42:16.053 --> 42:18.553
We have no evidence.

42:18.555 --> 42:20.054
And he knows that
we're after him.

42:20.056 --> 42:22.090
I don't know how.

42:24.328 --> 42:26.861
Or when.

42:29.065 --> 42:31.667
But I'm bringing Javier
to justice.

42:32.869 --> 42:34.535
I'm doing it for Eliza.
