You, you seem a little
distracted tonight

01:38.732 --> 01:41.802
my little pork loin.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.238
I was just thinking
about Jennifer and Larry.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.241
They get home
from their honeymoon tonight.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.811
Right about now Larry’s probably
carrying Jennifer

01:50.844 --> 01:54.247
across the threshold
of their new apartment.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.317
‐Isn’t it romantic?
‐Yes, it is.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.520
Unless Cousin Larry
threw his back out...

02:01.387 --> 02:03.590

Cousin Jennifer is carrying him

02:03.624 --> 02:06.259
across the threshold.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.195
Which is still kind of
romantic in a ’90s kind of way.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.200
Well, as long as
the lights are low

02:14.234 --> 02:17.838
and it’s just
the two of us...

02:17.871 --> 02:21.241
why don’t we take advantage
of the situation?

[music continues]

02:56.476 --> 02:58.512
Mary Anne, I need the key
to the apartment.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.982
Okay, Jennifer,
so, I made one little mistake!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.850
It was not
a little mistake.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.185
You didn’t put
the deposit down

03:05.218 --> 03:07.788
on our beautiful new apartment

03:07.821 --> 03:10.323

I, I promise you

03:11.925 --> 03:13.393
by this time tomorrow

03:13.426 --> 03:15.328
we’ll have an even
nicer apartment

03:15.361 --> 03:16.897

03:16.930 --> 03:18.799
That’s fine, Larry,
but until you find that place

03:18.832 --> 03:20.433
I’ll be living upstairs.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.368
Oh, we‐well,

Now, this room
has southern exposure

Larry, I love this house.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.706
It’s everything
I ever dreamed of.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.308
Well, nothing’s too good
for you, sweetheart.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.781
Yes! I won.

And this is one
of my fastest jackets.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.490
Uh, Mr. Dexter, I’d like
to look at the upstairs again.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.491
Sure.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.459
Did you notice
that we have designer faucets

04:20.493 --> 04:22.696
in the master bathroom?

04:22.729 --> 04:25.566
Balki, isn’t this great?
Jennifer loves this house.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.401
Cousin, you are going
to be so happy here.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.403
No, no, not here,
we’re not gonna be living here.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.372
No, Jennifer and I could
never afford a place like this.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.044
Cousin, I, I, I know
you think of me

04:38.078 --> 04:40.346

country pumpkin

04:40.380 --> 04:43.316
who just stepped off
the goat, but...

04:45.418 --> 04:48.421
...why would you show Jennifer
a house that you cannot afford?

04:48.454 --> 04:50.356
Well, Balki,
it’s simple.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.593
See, I promised Jennifer
I’d find her

04:52.626 --> 04:55.428
a terrific apartment to make up
for the one I lost.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.732
I couldn’t.
All I could find was a dump.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.734
Now, when Jennifer
comes back downstairs

05:00.767 --> 05:03.904
I’m going to insist
that we take this house.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.872
She’ll know we can’t
possibly afford it

05:05.906 --> 05:08.509
but I’ll tell her I’m willing
to sacrifice anything

05:08.542 --> 05:09.610
so she can have it.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.777
She still won’t take it

05:10.811 --> 05:13.379

the most wonderful husband

05:13.413 --> 05:14.915

05:14.948 --> 05:16.683
and we’ll live happily

05:33.667 --> 05:35.435

to understand is that

05:35.468 --> 05:37.370

loves this house

05:37.403 --> 05:38.972
the more
she’s gonna love me.

The more Cousin Jennifer
loves this house

isn’t it?

05:53.486 --> 05:54.988

Well, if you really want it

06:04.665 --> 06:07.834
we’ll‐we’ll just sacrifice
a‐and make it work somehow.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.504
I’ll probably have
to work a lot overtime.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.873
Maybe even
get a second job.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.808
We won’t be seeing
each other that much

but, but, hey, if this
is what you want

06:18.545 --> 06:20.581

but it’s too expensive.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.767
Yes, Balki, it’s
a very nice house

06:40.801 --> 06:42.703
but it’s just
really too expensive.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.870

it’s too much‐‐

06:43.904 --> 06:46.006

on the happiness

06:46.039 --> 06:47.741
that living in the house
like this could give you?

how many woman in America

06:56.583 --> 06:57.984
would give their eyebrow

06:58.018 --> 07:00.754
to have a window seat
like this?

07:00.787 --> 07:03.757
What about when it’s one of them
cold Chicago nights

07:03.790 --> 07:06.560
and it’s way too windy
to sit in the window seat?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.029
You want some place
nice and warm to snuggle up?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.531

it’s too much‐‐

Balki’s right.

to pass up.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.612
I can work extra flights.
It’s worth any sacrifice.

Remember,
we made a choice.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.071
Pay for heat
or pay for the rent.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.676
I thought we sold our wedding
gifts to pay for the rent?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.547
No, no,
we sold our wedding gifts

08:33.580 --> 08:35.115
so we could turn on
the electricity.

done anything lately

08:43.957 --> 08:45.726

a lot of stress.

who had to have this house.

this house in the first place.

of opening the door.

I’m so glad you didn’t fall
into that Santa Fe trap.

Uh, I made you
a housewarming gift.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.187
It’s a big batch
of ferret juice.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.623
Just let the fur
rise to the top...

09:51.658 --> 09:53.193
...and then skim it off.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.062
Thank you, Balki.

I’ll just go
wash our glass.

This minimalist look
you’re going for is really

10:12.178 --> 10:14.414
Balki, this isn’t
a minimalist look

10:14.447 --> 10:16.950
it’s a poverty look.

afford anything

10:19.753 --> 10:21.822

It’s your fault
we live like this.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.359
It’s your fault for convincing
Jennifer she wanted this house

10:26.392 --> 10:28.361
and turning my life
into a living hell!

10:30.997 --> 10:33.299
Cousin, if you want
to choke me

10:33.333 --> 10:35.702
if that makes you feel better,
go right ahead.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.304

10:38.338 --> 10:41.407
Okay, alright, I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.276
I’m as much
to blame as you are.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.680
But, I‐I just wanted
Jennifer to be happy

10:46.713 --> 10:47.981
at the start of our marriage.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.150
And now look at me!

10:50.183 --> 10:53.386
Look at me! I mean,
I’m eating airline peanuts.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.721
And, and I’m

10:54.755 --> 10:56.289
and I’m too‐too tensed to...

11:04.130 --> 11:06.399
...perform
my husbandly duties.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.937
Oh, that’s horrible...

11:12.272 --> 11:14.741
...making Cousin Jennifer
take out the garbage.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.315
Larry, I can’t go on
living like this.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.485
This house is cold,
we’re eating airline food

11:25.519 --> 11:27.120
and I just broke
our only glass.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.224
Larry, we can’t afford
this house. We have to move.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.259
Jen, we have been over this.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.161
There‐there’s no way
we can break our lease.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.899
But, but maybe
my night job

11:38.932 --> 11:41.467
at the slaughter house
will come through.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.469
Find a way
to break our lease!

11:43.504 --> 11:45.939
‐Find a way to break‐‐
‐Cousin! Stop it! Stop it!

‐Stop it!
‐Sorry, sorry.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.445
May I make an observation?

11:54.180 --> 11:56.349
I sense
a lot of tension here.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.853
Now, now,
listen to me, cousin

11:59.886 --> 12:01.922
your landlord look
like a nice man.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.924
He look like if you
explain yourself to him

12:03.957 --> 12:05.158
he’ll understand.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.127
Just go to him
and tell him the truth.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.230
Well, you know...

12:10.263 --> 12:11.998
...that might just be
crazy enough to work.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.467
Well, what have we got to lose?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.938
Yeah, I’ll, I’ll go down
and talk to Mr. Dexter

12:17.971 --> 12:19.840
and‐and tell him the truth!

12:19.873 --> 12:21.407
I‐I haven’t tried that.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.344
Maybe he’ll feel sorry for me.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.047
I know I do.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.152
Well, feed me nails
and call me Rusty.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.559
He’s going
to tell the truth.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.528
Oh, Balki, Mr. Dexter will
never let us out of the lease.

12:41.562 --> 12:43.864
We have to help him.
I have a plan!

12:43.897 --> 12:45.031
Oh, God!

12:45.065 --> 12:47.000
[instrumental music]

12:55.375 --> 12:57.878
Come on, Balki. Larry should be
with Mr. Dexter by now.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.350
I just figured out
what you want to do.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.353
You want to call Mr. Dexter
and pretend that we are people

13:07.387 --> 13:09.856
who want to rent the apartment
for more money.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.058
‐That’s right.
‐That is dishonest.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.960
I’m not going
to let you do that.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.863
Alright, fine, Balki.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.465
‐We’ll, we’ll do it your way.
‐Good.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.602
I’ll call Mr. Dexter
and tell him the truth.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.836
Good.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.375
He won’t let us
out of the lease.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.512
It’ll take every dime
we have to pay for the rent

13:31.545 --> 13:34.548
but eventually
we’ll run out of dimes.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.316
We’ll be living on the street.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.287
[gasps]
Oh, look! Look!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.524
Balki, who’s that?

13:43.557 --> 13:45.358
Who’s that digging through
the trash for food?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.395
Mrs. Schlegelmilch?

13:51.532 --> 13:53.433
It’s Cousin Larry.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.301
[gasps]
Oh, and who’s that
pathetic little creature

13:55.335 --> 13:57.538
in rags next to him?

13:57.571 --> 13:58.605
Me?

14:00.907 --> 14:02.242
It’s Cousin Jennifer.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.979
They’re hungry.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.313
Oh, sure, every once
in a while you’ll come by

14:07.347 --> 14:09.182
our little cardboard box
and give us some food.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.918
But one day
you’ll come by and...

14:11.952 --> 14:13.887
...we won’t be there.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.457
Why not?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.227
We’ll be dead.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.429
[crying]

14:23.463 --> 14:26.166
But, hey, the important thing is
you didn’t have to lie.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.201
No, Cousin Jennifer,
I don’t want you to be dead.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.537
We have to be dead.
We’re dead! We’re dead!

14:30.571 --> 14:32.539
I don’t want you to be dead!
I don’t want you to be dead!

14:32.573 --> 14:33.607
Fine. Make the call.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.141
[gasps]

14:35.175 --> 14:36.409
Oh, you’re good.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.180
[clears throat]

14:43.584 --> 14:45.686
‐Hello, Mr. Dexter. This is‐‐
‐No, Balki! Stop!

14:45.719 --> 14:47.487
‐Disguise your voice.
‐What?

14:47.521 --> 14:49.089
Well, pretend
you’re someone else.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.091
‐Who?
‐Anybody! Just do it!

14:51.124 --> 14:53.159
[breathing heavily]

14:53.193 --> 14:55.128
This is Robin Leach...

14:59.432 --> 15:02.135
...wishing you champagne wishes
and caviar dreams...

15:04.470 --> 15:08.074
...from our exclusive
state‐of‐the‐art super villa

15:08.108 --> 15:13.179
in fabulous
Puerta Vallarta!

15:13.213 --> 15:16.282
Not long ago
I was in Chicago

15:16.316 --> 15:19.452
that glittering jewel of steel
and glass quivering

15:19.485 --> 15:23.389
on the edge
of fabulous Lake Michigan...

15:23.423 --> 15:25.559
...and I happened to see
that adorable little house

15:25.592 --> 15:28.562
you had for rent
on fabulous Elm Street.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.030
That’s the one!

15:30.063 --> 15:32.198
That gem of gingerbread

15:32.232 --> 15:35.201
with its tempting turret
towering towards the twilight.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.273
I happened to mention it
to Charles and Di

15:40.306 --> 15:43.510
and the Prince and Princess
of Wales were wowed.

15:43.544 --> 15:47.013
Chic Chuck and Divine Di
said I would be foolish

15:47.047 --> 15:48.549
not to climb
on the Concord

15:48.582 --> 15:52.218
and jet right back here
and take it!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.687
What do you mean
it’s already been rented?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.155
‐No!
‐No!

15:55.188 --> 15:58.324
No! I’ve already
invited Liz and Joan

15:58.358 --> 16:02.128
and Liza and Ivana
for a pull‐out‐all‐the‐stops

16:02.162 --> 16:03.997
fabulous housewarming!

16:04.030 --> 16:05.766
I need that house, Mr. Dexter.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.101
Money is no object.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.370
The‐the current tenant
is there with you?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.239
Fabulous! It’s real‐life drama
at its best!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.743
Mr. Dexter, if you can
get him to break

16:16.777 --> 16:18.545
his lackluster lease

16:18.579 --> 16:20.681
I’ll offer you
a hundred dollars more a month

16:20.714 --> 16:23.016
than you’re getting now.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.652
No? No? Did I say
a hundred dollars more a month

16:25.686 --> 16:26.720
than you’re gettin’ now?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.154
Small change

16:28.188 --> 16:30.524
in the glittering world
of top real estate!

16:32.125 --> 16:34.294
I’ll give you double
what you’re getting now!

16:35.128 --> 16:36.630
No? Triple!

16:36.663 --> 16:39.032
I’ll give you triple
what you’re getting now!

16:39.065 --> 16:42.135
That’s almost
three times as much.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.572
Mr. Dexter,
I need that house.

16:45.606 --> 16:47.741
Call me when the house
becomes available.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.243
My number?
My number is, uh, is...

16:50.276 --> 16:51.578
Wha... My number is

16:51.612 --> 16:53.680
five‐five‐five

16:53.714 --> 16:57.450
four‐six‐nine‐three.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.219
Will I repeat that?

17:00.721 --> 17:03.489
Five‐five‐five‐four

17:03.524 --> 17:06.792
six‐nine‐three‐zero.

17:06.827 --> 17:08.561
No! No! No!

17:08.595 --> 17:10.396
Go! Go! Go!

17:10.430 --> 17:12.165
Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:12.198 --> 17:14.334
I’m gonna kill you!
I’m give up.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.137
Mr. Dexter, uh,
goodbye, Mr. Dexter

17:17.170 --> 17:19.740
and remember to always reach
for your dreams in life and love

17:19.772 --> 17:21.174
and you too will be a winner!

17:21.207 --> 17:23.209
Thank you for joining us.
I’m Robin Leach.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.150
[instrumental music]

17:35.722 --> 17:38.091
‐Balki, where’s Jennifer?
‐She’s upstairs.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.059
‐I gotta find her.
‐She’s upstairs.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.426
‐I gotta talk to her.
‐She’s upstairs.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.828
I gotta tell her
some great news!

17:41.862 --> 17:43.830
Well, cousin, that don’t change
a thing. She’s still upstairs.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.298
Now, why you don’t
tell me your news.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.100
Alright, Balki, Balki, Balki

17:47.133 --> 17:48.569
I just came
from Mr. Dexter’s office

17:48.602 --> 17:49.870
and you’ll never
guess what happened.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.205
Tell me, cousin.
Don’t keep me on suspenders.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.542
Okay. You know, I went
to Mr. Dexter’s

17:55.576 --> 17:57.477
to try to get him to let us
out of the lease.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.679
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

17:58.712 --> 17:59.880
Alright, well, at first
he was pretty firm

17:59.913 --> 18:01.247
he was gonna hold me to it.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.350
B‐but then
I told him the truth!

18:04.384 --> 18:07.420
Me, Larry Appleton!

18:07.453 --> 18:09.823
And here’s the weird part

18:09.856 --> 18:12.125
it worked!

18:12.158 --> 18:13.426
The truth worked!

18:13.459 --> 18:14.861
I don’t know how,
I don’t know why

18:14.895 --> 18:16.329
but it worked!

18:16.362 --> 18:18.498
‐Get out of the city!
‐Well, wait, wait, wait!

18:18.532 --> 18:21.535
It gets better. Y‐you’ll never
guessed what happened.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.369
Tell me, cousin, I never
could guess what happened.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.639
And not in a million years
could I guess what happened.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.674
You’d better tell me
what happened.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.677
‐The phone rang.
‐No.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.447
I could tell from Mr. Dexter’s
end of the conversation

18:34.480 --> 18:37.551
that someone was interested
in renting our house.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.620
And you’re not gonna
believe who it was.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.187
Who?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.388
Robin Leach.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.824
‐No!
‐Yes!

18:43.857 --> 18:46.660
‐No!
‐Yes. Robin Leach!

18:46.693 --> 18:48.562
He wanted to rent the house
and he was willing to pay

18:48.595 --> 18:50.163
more money
than we’re paying!

18:50.196 --> 18:52.332
Well, that’s when
I saw my chance.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.868
Oh, God.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.573
Mr. Dexter was just about
to let me out of the lease

18:59.606 --> 19:01.542
but I was too smart for him.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.782
Please, cousin, don’t tell me
you were too smart for him.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.654
I was way too smart for him.

19:13.687 --> 19:14.921
When Mr. Dexter
wasn’t looking

19:14.955 --> 19:17.924
I copied down
Robin Leach’s phone number.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.793
I’m going to call him.
and sublet the house to him

19:19.826 --> 19:20.794
for three times
what we’re paying.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.697
We’ll make 200 percent profit
every month!

19:23.730 --> 19:25.265
Cousin, there’s something
I think you should know.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.633
Well, hold on,
because I gotta make this call.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.534
Well, there’s something
I’ve got to tell you.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.803
Balki, hold on.
Let me make this call.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.508
Hello!

19:34.541 --> 19:35.776
Pioli’s Pizza?

19:37.878 --> 19:39.379
Why would Robin Leach
call and leave the number

19:39.412 --> 19:40.847
for Pioli’s Pizza?

19:40.881 --> 19:42.549
Well, cousin,
perhaps he’s smitten

19:42.583 --> 19:43.817
with their spectacularly

19:43.850 --> 19:46.452
succulent
Sicilian sausage pizza

19:46.486 --> 19:49.823
with a delicioso deep‐dish
doughy crust!

19:53.459 --> 19:55.461
[instrumental music]

19:57.598 --> 19:59.399
[instrumental music]

20:01.535 --> 20:04.738
Jennifer? Jennifer?

20:04.771 --> 20:07.941
Larry! Larry, I’m glad
you’re home. I have great news.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.376
So do I, you remember
we decided the only way

20:10.410 --> 20:11.878
we could afford this house
was to rent a room?

20:11.912 --> 20:12.946
Yes, I do.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.948
Well, since you were going away
on a long flight

20:14.981 --> 20:16.750
I decided to take
the responsibility on myself

20:16.783 --> 20:18.585
I found us a roommate.

20:18.619 --> 20:19.753
Well, Larry,
that’s very sweet

20:19.786 --> 20:21.922
but I thought that since
you’ve been working overtime

20:21.955 --> 20:23.423
I would take on
the responsibility

20:23.456 --> 20:24.725
of finding a roommate

20:24.758 --> 20:27.360
thereby reducing
your stress.

20:30.531 --> 20:31.665
I found us a roommate.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.733
Well, that’s very thoughtful

20:32.766 --> 20:34.635
but I found
a perfect roommate.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.869
Well, that’s very kind of you

20:35.902 --> 20:37.904
but I found
the perfect roommate.

20:37.938 --> 20:39.372
Come on down!

20:47.714 --> 20:49.349
Mary Anne,
what are you doing here?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.684
I’m gonna live here.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.653
‐She’s gonna live here?
‐Yes.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.988
Well, feed me bran
and call me regular.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.527
I’m gonna live here, too!

21:00.561 --> 21:01.895
[shrieking]

21:03.930 --> 21:05.999
Well, there are
three bedrooms.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.068
And we can split
the expenses.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.436
And still have some money
left over for a few luxuries

21:10.470 --> 21:12.005
like food and heat.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.510
This is great! We’ll have
a big celebration dinner.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.911
I hope you’re all hungry

21:17.944 --> 21:19.980
because I made
a big batch of pig snout.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.583
I’ve got it marinating
right now in orange Kool Aid.

21:25.919 --> 21:29.355
Hey, is this gonna be
great or what?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
Oh‐ho!

21:32.693 --> 21:35.428
[instrumental music]

22:01.021 --> 22:02.989
[sighs]
I’m gonna miss
this apartment, Balki.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.760
We had a lot of good times here.

22:09.896 --> 22:10.964
Yes, we did.

22:12.132 --> 22:13.867
[instrumental music]

22:32.519 --> 22:33.820
[theme music]
