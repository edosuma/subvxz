00:12.890 --> 00:14.830
What are you guys doing?

00:14.860 --> 00:16.730
Shooting a commercial
for sonic boom.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.000
My dad is paying you
to shoot a commercial?

00:19.030 --> 00:20.700
In real money?

00:20.740 --> 00:24.010
'cause I got chicken fingers
for allowance last week.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.980
I'm doing it for free.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.709
I'm hoping when other
stores see it,

00:27.710 --> 00:29.690
they'll pay me to shoot
their commercials

00:29.720 --> 00:32.860
Whoa, you're actually
doing work free?

00:32.890 --> 00:35.590
You're supposed to
get pay not to work.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.670
Have I taught you nothing?

00:38.770 --> 00:40.670
So what's up with
the huge guitar?

00:40.710 --> 00:44.640
Every director needs a "thing."
my "thing" is giant props

00:44.680 --> 00:46.850
And the splits.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.660
Okay, maybe just giant props.

00:55.690 --> 00:57.130
My thing is twitting.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.130
That's right, I join tweeter.
Ever heard of it?

01:00.170 --> 01:02.970
You're just joining tweeter now?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.869
Yep, Ally Dawson is officially

01:04.870 --> 01:06.740
a passenger on a train?

01:06.780 --> 01:09.980
All aboard. a-woot woot!

01:14.890 --> 01:15.990
Ally.

01:18.020 --> 01:21.920
The tweeter train left the
station about two years ago.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.030
And apparently, it left
you stranded there.

01:24.060 --> 01:26.700
Well, I got on this week,

01:26.730 --> 01:29.660
And I'm already up
to 11 followers.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.800
Austin just got 3,000 followers.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.640
This week?

01:34.670 --> 01:36.640
This morning.

01:36.670 --> 01:39.880
I don't get it. I post
really great twits.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.080
Let me see.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.720
"the radiant glow
of a friendly smile

01:44.750 --> 01:47.920
Will warm a heart for
a million miles"?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.990
Is this a twit or
your English paper?

01:51.030 --> 01:53.130
What are you talking about?

01:53.160 --> 01:56.000
Twits are supposed
to be silly and fun.

01:56.030 --> 01:57.806
You put way too much
thought into your twits.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.929
Here, check out
what I posted when

01:59.930 --> 02:03.769
I was eating pancakes with Dez.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.170
"Eating pancakes

02:06.940 --> 02:08.880
With dez."

02:18.650 --> 02:21.920
"chilling at sonic
boom with my buds."

02:24.660 --> 02:25.936
"there is nothing more important

02:25.960 --> 02:28.800
Than the moments you share
with your friends."

02:28.830 --> 02:30.070
twit!

02:30.100 --> 02:33.910
Hey, I just lost
three followers.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.920
When the crowd wants more

02:42.950 --> 02:44.650
I bring on the thunder

02:44.690 --> 02:46.020
'cause you've got my back

02:46.050 --> 02:47.720
And i'm not going under

02:47.760 --> 02:48.996
You're my point, you're my guard

02:49.020 --> 02:50.760
You're the perfect chord

02:50.790 --> 02:53.760
And i see our names
together on every billboard

02:53.800 --> 02:56.830
We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock

02:56.870 --> 02:58.100
We'll make 'em say "hey!"

02:58.130 --> 03:00.770
And we'll keep rockin'

03:00.800 --> 03:04.870
There's no way I could
make it without ya

03:04.910 --> 03:07.910
Do it without ya,
be here without ya

03:07.950 --> 03:10.850
It's no fun when
you're doing it solo

03:10.880 --> 03:13.990
With you it's like,
"whoa," yeah, and i know

03:14.020 --> 03:16.820
I own this dream

03:16.860 --> 03:19.990
'cause i got you with me

03:20.030 --> 03:23.060
There's no way i could
make it without ya

03:23.100 --> 03:26.729
Do it without ya,
be here without ya.

03:26.730 --> 03:30.730
Austin & Ally S01E12
Soups & Stars

03:33.010 --> 03:35.880
Guess who got a job
at Suzy's soups?

03:35.910 --> 03:38.080
You'll never guess
who the owner is.

03:38.110 --> 03:41.810
Wait, don't tell me...
someone named Suzy?

03:43.720 --> 03:46.690
It's miss Suzy, our elementary
school music teacher.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.860
No way! I loved miss Suzy.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.730
She's a big reason why I start
to take music seriously.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.730
She's a big reason why I
to take naps in class.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.000
She was so boring.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.940
So miss Suzy's not
teaching anymore?

04:01.970 --> 04:03.670
No, she's retired,

04:03.700 --> 04:05.740
But she still acts like
a third grade teacher.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.810
She gives us gold stars
for doing good work

04:07.840 --> 04:10.780
And instead of breaks,
she gives us recess.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.750
Ah, recess.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.669
Nothing better than curling up

04:15.670 --> 04:17.690
in the library with
a good book, huh?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.990
What? I hated the playground.

04:22.019 --> 04:24.106
I was always getting nailed in
the head with a dodge ball.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.730
Ah, dodge ball.

04:28.130 --> 04:30.800
So miss Suzy

04:30.830 --> 04:33.830
Still gives out gold stars, huh?

04:33.870 --> 04:37.000
-I never got one of those.
-really?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.939
I got this one for spilling hot

04:38.940 --> 04:40.840
soup on only one customer today.

04:40.870 --> 04:44.110
And this one for going potty.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.680
I wanna go see miss Suzy.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.680
I'm gonna twit an update.
I'm getting good at these.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.720
"cruisin' to Suzy's soups
to see my old teach."

04:55.790 --> 04:59.690
"teachers are like candles.
They light the way for others."

04:59.720 --> 05:02.860
It's like you want to
get hit by dodge balls.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.970
Do you guys have to
make those noises?

05:14.010 --> 05:16.010
Sorry. we'll make
different noises.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.810
Come on, honey.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.680
I'll show you how to do
a setup at the station.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.720
Crackers on your left,
spoons on your right

05:27.750 --> 05:31.020
When you're eating soup,
you never have to bite

05:31.060 --> 05:34.090
As long as you pay
me, it's all good

05:34.130 --> 05:37.900
-la la la la la la la la la la.
-ohh.

05:37.930 --> 05:40.700
Hi, miss Suzy. remember me?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.040
How could I ever forget you,

05:42.070 --> 05:44.740
My little Ally-gator?

05:44.770 --> 05:46.810
She gave us all
nicknames in class.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.810
I was Trish-kabob.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.980
My teachers used to
call me "d-plus."

05:52.010 --> 05:55.050
They put it at the
top of all my tests.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.920
Do you kids need more crayons

05:57.950 --> 05:59.850
To color on your placemats?

05:59.890 --> 06:03.720
Miss Suzy, we're grown up now.
We don't color anymore.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.830
Speak for yourself, Ally-gator.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.860
-ta-dah! -oh!

06:08.900 --> 06:11.700
That shows real potential.

06:11.730 --> 06:14.630
You get a gold star.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.640
Sweet!

06:16.670 --> 06:18.940
Ta-dah!

06:18.970 --> 06:22.740
And you finished all your soup.

06:22.780 --> 06:26.750
-You get a gold star, too.
-awesome!

06:26.780 --> 06:28.850
Lunch has always been
my best subject.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.890
And you get a gold star,
too, Trish-kabob.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.720
Why does Trish-kabob
get a gold star?

06:37.760 --> 06:39.730
She's really improving
at her job.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.060
She's not ladling soup
with her hands anymore.

06:43.730 --> 06:47.640
That's what she thinks.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.670
Well, I just finished my soup.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.740
Do I get anything for that?

06:52.770 --> 06:55.640
Yes, you do.

06:55.680 --> 06:59.050
The nutritious benefits
of a hearty bowl of soup.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.780
This place is awesome.
I'm gonna twit about it.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.950
Wait, where's my phone?

07:06.990 --> 07:09.890
You know, you wouldn't
keep losing your phone

07:09.920 --> 07:12.030
If you didn't carry
around all that junk.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.030
This isn't junk. I
need this stuff.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.000
Really? You need an
anchor, a license plate

07:17.030 --> 07:19.970
And a rubber spider?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.670
Yes, Ally, I do.

07:24.070 --> 07:27.610
-Ah, here it is. -I'm
gonna twit, too.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.040
"eating at suzy's soups.

07:29.070 --> 07:31.780
What's soup, everybody?"

07:31.810 --> 07:33.150
Good one.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.020
I can do a cool twit, too.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.820
Give me a minute to think

07:36.850 --> 07:38.650
Don't think. just do. do.

07:39.950 --> 07:42.860
I just said "do-do."

07:42.890 --> 07:44.960
I gotta twit that.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.790
What do you want me to do?

07:46.830 --> 07:48.809
Put dez's rubber
spider in a bowl

07:48.810 --> 07:50.800
of soup and take a picture of it

07:50.830 --> 07:54.840
- that's pretty funny. -I'll
call it "spider noodle soup."

07:55.910 --> 07:57.870
there.

07:59.810 --> 08:03.650
Thanks, dez. i guess "sder
noodle soup" is pretty funny.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.980
No, austin just said "do-do." -

08:06.020 --> 08:08.020
What up?!

08:14.660 --> 08:17.690
Whoa! are you shooting a
commercial for the science store?

08:17.730 --> 08:19.549
No, I'm shooting that
commercial later.

08:19.550 --> 08:20.900
I'm just lookin for my keys

08:26.800 --> 08:27.900
Hey, Ally.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.670
Hey, guys,

08:30.710 --> 08:32.909
Guess who got 5,000 new
followers on tweeter?

08:32.940 --> 08:34.809
That's right, me.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.980
I hate to toot my own
horn, but toot-toot!

08:38.020 --> 08:40.020
5,000 new followers.
that's awesome.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.720
Go ahead, austin. you
can toot the horn.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.650
Toot-toot.

08:45.890 --> 08:49.090
I guess people do appreciate
my well-thought-out twits.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.690
No, everyone appreciates
that spider picture you took

08:51.730 --> 08:53.930
At miss Suzy's soups.

08:53.970 --> 08:57.070
Wait, you're telling me I
got 5,000 new followers

08:57.100 --> 08:59.870
Just because of
"spider noodle soup"?

08:59.900 --> 09:01.940
Yeah, it's awesome.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.940
It's not awesome for miss suzy.

09:03.970 --> 09:06.680
She sent me home because there
weren't any customers...

09:06.710 --> 09:09.650
-thanks to you. -thanks to me?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.880
Yeah, I'm thanking you. I
got the afternoon off!

09:12.920 --> 09:15.990
No no, Why aren't
there any customers?

09:16.020 --> 09:18.029
People think we have
bugs in our soup

09:18.030 --> 09:19.820
because of that picture you took

09:19.860 --> 09:21.880
If miss Suzy doesn't
get some customers

09:23.790 --> 09:25.700
Oh, man, what did I do?

09:21.880 --> 09:23.790
Soon, she's gonna
out of business

09:27.630 --> 09:29.706
You twitted a picture of a
spider in miss Suzy's soups

09:29.730 --> 09:32.740
And now you're ruining her life.
Come on, Ally, keep up!

09:43.860 --> 09:45.630
Ally!

09:46.830 --> 09:48.700
You look exhausted.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.600
I'm fine.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.770
Thank you for shopping
at sonic change.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.700
Here's your boom.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.869
Okay, I'm exhausted.

09:58.870 --> 09:59.959
I was up all night
trying to figure

09:59.960 --> 10:01.086
out how to save miss
Suzy's business

10:01.110 --> 10:03.010
It's all my fault
she's gonna lose it.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.880
It's not all your fault.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.320
People are making it worse by
putting up more fake pictures.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.320
Look.

10:09.350 --> 10:12.220
An eyeball in a bowl
of miss Suzy's soup.

10:12.260 --> 10:15.330
A cruise ship in a bowl of soup.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.990
Bigfoot in a bowl of soup.

10:18.030 --> 10:22.000
What kind of person would do
this just to get a cheap laugh?

10:22.030 --> 10:24.130
I did the bigfoot one.
funny, right?

10:24.170 --> 10:27.040
Wrong. if miss Suzy
loses her business,

10:27.070 --> 10:29.340
She's gonna hate me even
more than she already does.

10:29.370 --> 10:30.949
What are you talking about?,

10:30.950 --> 10:32.316
you are her favorite
student forever,

10:32.340 --> 10:34.210
Then why hasn't she
given me a gold star?

10:34.250 --> 10:37.110
Do you know how bad
i want a gold star?

10:37.150 --> 10:41.020
You know they're not
real gold, right?

10:41.050 --> 10:43.120
Hey, guys, we just
came from miss Suzy's,

10:43.160 --> 10:45.990
And it was emp-ty.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.990
I guess I can cross
miss suzy off my list

10:48.030 --> 10:50.060
Of potential commercial clients.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.930
Dez, that's it. that's how
we'll save miss Suzy's.

10:54.970 --> 10:57.100
We'll make a commercial

10:57.140 --> 10:59.270
You just saw me cross
her off the list.

11:01.310 --> 11:04.010
No, that's a great idea.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.910
I'll write a jingle,
you can sing it,

11:05.940 --> 11:07.098
- Dez can direct it and Trish

11:07.110 --> 11:08.280
can act in it. -Oh great!

11:08.310 --> 11:10.210
How's this?

11:11.280 --> 11:14.990
Ahh! There's a
spider in my soup!

11:16.920 --> 11:19.120
That was good, but we
probably shouldn't mention

11:19.160 --> 11:21.160
The whole
spider-in-the-soup thing.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.100
Got it.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.130
Ahhh! There's not a spider

11:27.170 --> 11:29.200
In my soup!

11:31.370 --> 11:33.210
Better.

11:38.410 --> 11:40.980
Is this really your jingle
for the soup commercial?

11:41.020 --> 11:44.150
"when life gets you down, and
you need to heal your soul,

11:44.190 --> 11:46.050
Only one thing can suit you,

11:46.090 --> 11:49.090
And it comes in a ceramic bowl"?

11:50.360 --> 11:53.390
Pretty great, huh? I put a lot
of thought into those lyrics.

11:53.430 --> 11:56.060
Look, Ally, you're the
best songwriter I know.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.930
I like where you're going with this.
Keep talking.

11:58.970 --> 12:01.300
- This jingle's not very good.
- Okay, stop talking.

12:01.340 --> 12:04.940
Jingles are about selling things.
What are we selling here?

12:04.970 --> 12:07.170
Love, hope, the triumph
of the human spirit.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.170
No, we're selling soup.

12:09.210 --> 12:12.080
Soup, soup, soup, soup, soup.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.380
Ooh, I like that!

12:15.180 --> 12:18.180
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.150
We should use that for
miss Suzy's commercial.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.290
I like the jingle I wrote.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.320
No offense, but the last
time I took your advice

12:24.360 --> 12:28.160
About what to write, I
ruined miss Suzy's business.

12:28.190 --> 12:30.230
Okay, no biggie.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.230
We'll record your jingle.

12:32.270 --> 12:34.140
Just hang on a second
I just need to

12:34.150 --> 12:35.970
post my hourly
update on twitter."

12:36.000 --> 12:37.909
What kind of person has
nothing better to do

12:37.910 --> 12:39.910
than wait to see what you
are doing every hour

12:39.940 --> 12:41.619
Austin, hurry up! I'm waiting to

12:41.620 --> 12:43.340
hear what fun stuff
you update to."

12:47.950 --> 12:49.196
"chillin' in the practice room."

12:49.220 --> 12:51.950
Man, you live the life.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.930
When the pressure of
life gets you down

13:00.960 --> 13:03.330
And you wanna turn
that frown upside down

13:03.360 --> 13:05.370
Don't be sad, don't be blue

13:05.400 --> 13:08.130
Miss Suzy's got a soup for you.

13:10.070 --> 13:12.210
So what do you think, miss Suzy?

13:12.240 --> 13:15.040
Pretty gold star worthy, huh?

13:15.080 --> 13:18.180
Ally, this jingle
is truly a triumph

13:18.210 --> 13:20.310
Of the human spirit,

13:20.350 --> 13:23.050
But I'm just trying
to sell soup here.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.326
That's what I said! I think
it should be a lot simpler,

13:26.350 --> 13:29.960
Like... soup soup soup
soup soup soup soup.

13:29.990 --> 13:31.336
I'm sorry. I tried to
tell him earlier that

13:31.360 --> 13:33.330
Oh! I love it.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.330
-what? -let's all
sing it together.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.900
One and a two and a...

13:37.930 --> 13:40.370
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.240
This jingle is perfect

13:44.270 --> 13:45.370
For the commercial.

13:45.410 --> 13:49.080
I may not lose my
business after all.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.950
Gold star for you, Austin.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.280
-soup soup soup...
-whoo! awesome!

13:54.320 --> 13:58.190
Congrats on another
gold star, Austin.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.220
What's wrong?

14:01.260 --> 14:03.920
Are you mad miss Suzy
didn't pick your jingle?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.290
Isn't it more important we're
gonna save her restaurant?

14:06.330 --> 14:09.060
I know. I'm happy about that.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.200
It's just miss Suzy is the
only teacher I've ever had

14:12.230 --> 14:14.200
That never gave me a gold star.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.070
Who cares? gold stars are silly.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.240
That's easy for you
to say, Austin.

14:19.270 --> 14:22.010
Good things always happen to
you and you don't even try.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.180
Your life is like a gold star.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.950
That's not true. hey, Look!

14:26.980 --> 14:29.020
I just found 20 bucks.

14:31.150 --> 14:34.990
Miss Suzy was my music teacher.
I looked up to her.

14:35.020 --> 14:36.959
If she says I'm
doing a good job,

14:36.960 --> 14:38.890
then I know I'm
doing a good job,

14:38.930 --> 14:41.060
Ally, do you really need
to have your jingle

14:41.090 --> 14:44.030
In miss Suzy's commercial
just to get her approval?

14:44.060 --> 14:47.130
Well, when you put it like that,

14:47.170 --> 14:49.170
Yes! yes, I do.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.140
I'll make my own commercial,

14:51.170 --> 14:55.040
Use my jingle and
get a gold star!

14:58.010 --> 14:59.980
Ally, that wasn't my point.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.360
It's just a soup commercial.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.379
Ally, you're making
this way more

15:10.380 --> 15:12.300
complicated than it needs to be

15:12.330 --> 15:14.300
What are you talking about?

15:14.340 --> 15:18.170
It is not just a commercial.
We're saving Suzy's soups.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.040
And who knows

15:20.080 --> 15:22.910
Maybe I'll get a gold
star in the process.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.280
Where are my actors?

15:27.120 --> 15:30.990
-Ally, we look ridiculous. -Yeah

15:31.020 --> 15:33.320
These tights are really tight.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.260
Hey, I bet that's why
they call them tights.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.090
So what's with the
giant bowl of soup?

15:41.130 --> 15:43.360
I'm the director. you know
big props are my "thing."

15:43.400 --> 15:45.170
That and tap-dancing.

15:59.410 --> 16:02.180
All right, let's shoot this.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.679
Austin, you're
playing a sailor who

16:05.680 --> 16:07.320
just returned from
being lost sea

16:07.360 --> 16:09.170
Trish, you play his
loyal wife who

16:09.180 --> 16:10.990
Thought you will
never see him again,

16:11.030 --> 16:13.300
Your motivation is your
mutual love of soup.

16:13.330 --> 16:15.200
Okay, we're ready.

16:15.230 --> 16:19.000
-And action! -Ally,
you're not a director.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.240
You don't know how to say action.
And action!

16:24.970 --> 16:27.980
Cornelia, when I
was lost at sea,

16:28.010 --> 16:31.380
I thought of two things
every day to keep me happy

16:31.410 --> 16:34.420
You and soup.

16:36.950 --> 16:38.190
Oh, Benjamin,

16:38.220 --> 16:41.020
I would never have
survived your absence

16:41.060 --> 16:44.290
If not for the warmth
of this wonton soup.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.099
Cut!

16:48.100 --> 16:50.369
Ally, again, you're
not a director.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.040
You don't know how
to say "cut." Cut!

16:56.140 --> 17:00.110
Why is there wonton soup
in this giant soup bowl?

17:00.140 --> 17:02.210
Dez, I told you to get
chickenn noodle soup.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.010
For the last time, Ally,
you're not a director.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.250
Only I can yell at
people on my set.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.679
Dez, what were you thinking?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.250
She told you to get
chiken noodle soup.

17:15.030 --> 17:18.200
What does it matter if it's
wonton or chicken noodle?

17:18.230 --> 17:21.099
Because there was
no Chinese food

17:21.130 --> 17:22.970
In colonial America!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.628
Why don't we just
put a drive-through

17:24.630 --> 17:26.200
here and everyoneng
can get tacos

17:26.240 --> 17:28.339
Ooh, if we're doing
a drive-through,

17:28.369 --> 17:30.980
I'd rather have hamburgers.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.310
Everybody focus.

17:32.340 --> 17:34.980
This commercial has
to be perfect.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.020
Relax, it's just soup.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.150
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup

17:39.190 --> 17:40.990
Soup soup soup soup soup soup...

17:41.020 --> 17:43.320
Stop it! It is more
than just soup.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.230
I want a gold star!

17:46.260 --> 17:48.230
Ally, I'll give you
all my gold stars

17:48.260 --> 17:50.300
If you promise to calm down.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.000
I am calm!

17:53.030 --> 17:54.719
Now if this soup
is gonna be right,

17:54.720 --> 17:56.300
I need to pull this one down.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.969
By enormous noodles,
boil them up,

17:57.970 --> 17:59.270
Cut some giant

18:09.020 --> 18:11.190
-Are you OK -Awesome!

18:16.090 --> 18:20.100
Okay, maybe I do need to
calm down a little bit.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.400
There's a wonton on
my head, isn't there?

18:32.270 --> 18:34.210
There you are.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.180
We've been looking
for you for hours.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.350
I've been in the practice
room this whole time.

18:38.380 --> 18:41.150
- Where were you looking?
- All your favorite places...

18:41.180 --> 18:43.180
The pizza parlor and the arcade.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.920
I don't like either
of those places.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.220
Fine, we went to our
favorite places.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.430
I won a frog.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
Are you okay?

18:55.230 --> 18:57.330
No, I feel terrible.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.139
I got so caught up in
trying to win miss

18:59.140 --> 19:01.140
Miss Suzy's approval that
I ruined her commercial.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.440
Now she's definitely
gonna lose her business.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.940
Ally, have you
seen your tweeter?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.286
You have more followers
than Austin.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.180
What? how did that happen?

19:10.220 --> 19:12.180
Let's just say someone
edited your footage,

19:12.220 --> 19:14.080
Made miss Suzy an
awesome commercial

19:14.120 --> 19:16.419
And posted it on
your tweeter feed.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.060
You can thankd BFF

19:18.090 --> 19:19.960
Trish did that?

19:19.990 --> 19:22.030
No, me. your b.f.f....

19:22.060 --> 19:24.930
Best freckled friend.

19:26.130 --> 19:29.300
That's not at all what it
stands for, but thank you.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.040
No, thank us, too.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.140
We helped, after we
left the arcade.

19:35.410 --> 19:38.110
-I won a frog!

19:38.150 --> 19:39.980
Check it out.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.950
When the pressure of
life gets you down

19:44.990 --> 19:47.390
And you wanna turn
that frown upside down

19:47.420 --> 19:49.120
Don't be sad, don't be blue

19:49.160 --> 19:51.160
Miss Suzy's got a soup for you

19:51.190 --> 19:55.130
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup

19:55.160 --> 19:57.270
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
Soup soup soup soup
soup soup soup... -

20:00.340 --> 20:04.040
Soup soup!

20:04.070 --> 20:05.270
Suzy's soups...

20:05.310 --> 20:07.310
So good, you'll wanna
dive right in.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.180
We do not have spiders!

20:09.210 --> 20:11.280
Oh, Ally.

20:11.320 --> 20:15.150
Your commercial
saved my business.

20:15.190 --> 20:18.360
-I wanna give you something.
-Really?

20:18.390 --> 20:20.460
Ta-dah!

20:22.290 --> 20:25.330
- Coupons for free soup.
- For the whole year!

20:28.370 --> 20:31.270
-miss Suzy, can i ask you something?
-Sure.

20:31.300 --> 20:34.140
How come you give
everyone else gold stars

20:34.170 --> 20:35.370
But me?

20:35.410 --> 20:38.980
Oh, Ally, because you
don't need them.

20:39.010 --> 20:42.050
You're the most talented
student I've ever have

20:42.080 --> 20:44.099
Usually, I just
give gold stars to

20:44.100 --> 20:46.050
people who need
extra motivation.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.050
Like Trish-kob.

20:48.090 --> 20:51.290
Hey, I only broke
10 bowls today.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.360
Oh, well...

20:54.390 --> 20:56.230
Here's a gold star.

20:56.260 --> 21:00.200
Yay! Gold star! Yay!

21:00.230 --> 21:03.300
See? I told you you were
being silly for nothing.

21:03.340 --> 21:06.240
Okay, here it goes.

21:06.270 --> 21:09.140
I know you don't need this,

21:09.180 --> 21:11.940
But gold star

21:11.980 --> 21:13.310
For Ally-gator.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.380
Oh!

21:17.050 --> 21:19.180
You finally got your gold star.
How's it feel?

21:19.220 --> 21:22.250
Eh, not that big of a deal.

21:22.290 --> 21:25.120
Kidding. This is the
best thing ever.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.420
Gold star dance!

21:26.460 --> 21:29.260
Gold star! Gold star!

21:29.300 --> 21:31.200
Who's got a gold star?

21:31.230 --> 21:34.070
Ally's got a gold star!

21:37.070 --> 21:38.400
Dear cornelia,

21:38.440 --> 21:42.010
I'm afraid I must return to sea.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.170
Oh, Benjamin, if
you must leave me,

21:45.210 --> 21:48.240
I want to give you something
to remember me by.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.279
-A guitar? -From sonic boom.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.219
All the instruments you need

21:55.220 --> 21:58.160
At historically low prices.

21:58.190 --> 22:02.160
Sonic boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom!

22:02.190 --> 22:05.190
And cut! Ally is
going to love it.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.759
Where is she anyway

22:06.760 --> 22:08.460
Oh, she is covering
for me in Miss Suzy's

22:08.860 --> 22:09.960
Why would she do that

22:10.460 --> 22:13.960
Sorry I'm late, just
have the best day ever

22:14.305 --> 22:20.175
