WEBVTT

00:02.959 --> 00:04.653
Can't believe she lied to me.

00:04.708 --> 00:07.333
[SCOFFS] Well, this is what you get.

00:09.064 --> 00:10.117
Young man...

00:10.680 --> 00:11.998
[SCOFFS]

00:12.007 --> 00:14.577
Uncle Curtis, we both know
that you can't catch me.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.096
Did that catch you?

00:19.142 --> 00:20.612
Now, now, now.

00:20.737 --> 00:22.560
Pops, maybe this is for the best.

00:23.085 --> 00:24.922
How the hell is this for the best?

00:24.959 --> 00:26.191
Well, you could get your money back,

00:26.202 --> 00:28.524
- and now we can all go home.
- Uh... no.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.203
My mama not gonna give
you that money back.

00:31.204 --> 00:32.339
She spent it.

00:33.565 --> 00:36.459
- What?!
- Yeah. It's gone.

00:39.199 --> 00:40.618
I been duped!

00:41.663 --> 00:44.734
♪ I been duped, and I been scorned ♪

00:45.955 --> 00:47.636
Kind of like you did on Ella.

00:48.206 --> 00:49.692
I didn't dupe her.

00:50.141 --> 00:52.691
Wait, so moving down
here, selling her house,

00:52.737 --> 00:55.294
and not telling her, that's
not duping her? [SCOFFS]

00:55.317 --> 00:56.975
What generation are you from, man?

00:57.614 --> 01:00.138
I'm from the generation
to tear that ass up!

01:00.151 --> 01:01.828
- Oh, okay.
- That's where I'm from.

01:01.851 --> 01:03.243
- I understand.
- Do you really?

01:03.261 --> 01:04.334
- No, I do.
- You dig?

01:04.352 --> 01:05.855
[STAMMERS] Hey, I know the generation.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.333
I can't believe this place!

01:10.061 --> 01:11.387
Look at it... it's a dump.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.763
[CHUCKLES] You right about that.

01:13.781 --> 01:16.430
Telling me this place
made $8,000 a month.

01:17.839 --> 01:19.446
- I'ma kill her.
- Who?

01:19.465 --> 01:20.556
Yo mama.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.846
Hey, man, you ain't gonna touch my mama.

01:24.338 --> 01:25.691
And what you gonna do?

01:26.184 --> 01:27.280
Call the police.

01:28.694 --> 01:30.578
Well, they not coming here, I'm sure.

01:32.074 --> 01:34.847
Telling me this place
made $8,000 a month.

01:35.492 --> 01:37.053
Are you sure you heard her right?

01:37.081 --> 01:38.224
Yes!

01:38.610 --> 01:42.120
That's what she said, $8,000 a month.

01:42.245 --> 01:44.717
Look, the only way this place
is making that kind of money

01:44.731 --> 01:46.186
is if you add a pole in here.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.674
You see what I'm saying?

01:49.014 --> 01:50.640
What you know about adding a pole?

01:50.681 --> 01:52.095
[LAUGHS]

01:52.220 --> 01:53.924
Dad, I am not a little kid anymore.

01:53.924 --> 01:56.540
I am a grown man, all right?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.143
I'm a pole expert.

02:00.013 --> 02:03.578
Well, Mr. Pole Expert, let me
catch you somewhere there's a pole,

02:03.643 --> 02:05.131
unless it's a fire station.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.774
- But Cousin Calvin took me to a strip...
- Hey, man!

02:08.797 --> 02:11.082
- What's wrong with you?
- Snitches get stitches.

02:11.409 --> 02:13.399
- You not supposed to snitch.
- Right.

02:13.827 --> 02:16.554
Well, if this place makes
what you say it makes,

02:16.679 --> 02:18.074
Aunt Ella will be very happy.

02:18.199 --> 02:19.506
But if it doesn't...

02:19.879 --> 02:22.399
Man, she gonna be angrier
than she already is.

02:22.947 --> 02:25.908
And you can forget about trying
to convince her to move forever.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.510
Get out of my way!

02:29.238 --> 02:30.521
Move!

02:31.431 --> 02:32.559
Where you going?

02:33.209 --> 02:34.356
To the church.

02:39.315 --> 02:40.762

02:58.770 --> 03:00.784
Wow, Aunt Ella, you've been
trying to do something like this

03:00.796 --> 03:02.689
in Atlanta for years.

03:02.718 --> 03:05.293
And I would have, if it
weren't for the board.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.555
The board at the church always...

03:08.108 --> 03:11.130
Talking about budget cuts.
Budget cuts, budget cuts.

03:11.189 --> 03:13.668
- Budget, budget, budget cuts!
- I know you were upset.

03:13.675 --> 03:15.960
And the administrators...
They got more raises.

03:15.975 --> 03:18.433
- They do, they did.
- I'm telling you, it was three of them.

03:18.455 --> 03:21.067
Okay, this never puts
you in a good place, okay?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.029
How do you get raises in
the middle of a budget cut?

03:24.075 --> 03:26.351
- That don't make much sense.
- Budget cut, budget cut, raise.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.188
- Sorry, I...
- Budget cut, budget cut, raise.

03:28.188 --> 03:29.878
Okay, Aunt... Aunt Ella, but listen...

03:29.910 --> 03:32.617
- Oxymoron, don't go together.
- Oxymoron, but you know what?

03:32.871 --> 03:35.179
- This is nice. This...
- And the pastor.

03:35.262 --> 03:36.694
not the pastor.

03:36.763 --> 03:39.195
- His lover offerings.
- Oh, please don't.

03:39.227 --> 03:40.835
A different envelope.

03:42.714 --> 03:44.957
Ha! Trimmed in gold!

03:45.007 --> 03:46.790
- You remember that.
- I remember.

03:48.379 --> 03:50.332
That's what they should
have budget cut...

03:50.382 --> 03:51.607
The envelopes.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.717
I remember when they used to have a hat.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.526
Didn't even have a bucket.

03:57.116 --> 03:59.940
Budget cut... then let me tell you,
they budget cut all them baskets.

04:00.953 --> 04:03.053
What I want you to focus on
right now is the happiness.

04:03.062 --> 04:04.850
- This is so great, isn't it?
- What happiness?

04:04.854 --> 04:05.941
- This place.
- Incredible.

04:05.973 --> 04:08.064
Look how happy the kids look.

04:08.341 --> 04:09.860
- They are.
- They are.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.845
That's because they have
somewhere to go after school.

04:11.868 --> 04:15.221
That keeps them out of
trouble and out of the gangs.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.321
Just can't get over all these kids.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.284
Just look at 'em!

04:18.293 --> 04:20.499
It looks like a pain in
the Payne, if you ask me.

04:21.504 --> 04:22.908
Little girl...

04:23.314 --> 04:24.843
[CHUCKLES] I'm sorry, Mom.

04:24.856 --> 04:27.261
You know I be forgetting that
I say stuff out loud sometimes.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.163
- Yes, yes.
- Janine,

04:29.232 --> 04:30.923
do you see that
computer area over there?

04:30.946 --> 04:32.595
You see how she set up a computer area?

04:32.623 --> 04:34.042
Yes, look! You see, Jazzie?

04:34.088 --> 04:36.676
Yeah, old computers. That's exciting.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.196
I think... I think they're nice.

04:39.247 --> 04:40.679
- They are nice.
- Yeah, you're right.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.843
From 15 years ago, those are real nice.

04:44.110 --> 04:48.311
Well, Jazzie, there are some kids
who do not have computers at home.

04:48.348 --> 04:50.725
And parents that do everything for them.

04:50.766 --> 04:51.803
Hmm.

04:53.732 --> 04:55.611
- I think she just read me.
- Yeah.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.835
[LAUGHS]

04:57.876 --> 05:00.036
- Oh, you know that word?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.206
I can throw back to
the '60s, now. Don't...

05:05.324 --> 05:07.088
- I'ma choke her.
- Don't do it.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.819
I wanted to...

05:10.828 --> 05:12.504
Set the computers up just like that.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.176
I know. Hey!

05:14.356 --> 05:17.170
You know, maybe God
was using Uncle Curtis.

05:17.295 --> 05:19.845
Mom, how is God gonna do that?
He don't know Uncle Curtis.

05:19.868 --> 05:21.894
Jazz...

05:21.917 --> 05:24.206
I'm just saying, he
created him and was like,

05:24.220 --> 05:26.210
- [DEEP VOICE] "What did I just do?"
- You know what?

05:26.247 --> 05:27.273
I'm gonna send you out

05:27.280 --> 05:29.940
- to the car in just a moment.
- Did you just do a deep voice for God?

05:29.966 --> 05:31.893
Yes, i... it... it was powerful.

05:31.897 --> 05:33.326
[NORMAL VOICE] You know, he
would sound like that, right?

05:33.341 --> 05:34.830
- He would be powerful.
- Right.

05:34.955 --> 05:36.786
And you would be quiet from now on.

05:37.048 --> 05:38.808
- Wait, did you just say you were gonna...
- Yes,

05:38.841 --> 05:40.684
- yes. In the car, yes.
- I was gonna wait outside? Mom,

05:40.706 --> 05:42.766
in this neighborhood,
anything could happen to me.

05:44.096 --> 05:45.182
Then be quiet.

05:48.336 --> 05:49.961
Okay, I'll play with my phone.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.766
- I really like this.
- So...

05:54.810 --> 05:57.275
- I really like this.
- Does that mean you're gonna stay?

05:57.798 --> 06:00.855
That means that I'm so mad at
Curtis, I can't even think about it.

06:00.881 --> 06:02.584
Which means you're
actually thinking about it.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.977
Janine, please...

06:05.512 --> 06:07.081
- I'm just saying...
- Do you think I should stay?

06:07.099 --> 06:08.677
I... I'm not saying
that, I'm just saying

06:08.688 --> 06:10.170
that you have been
frustrated at the church...

06:10.203 --> 06:11.350
"Budget cut, budget cut, budget cut."

06:11.351 --> 06:12.554
You know, that thing.

06:12.679 --> 06:14.846
And then you've been saying
you needed a change of pace

06:14.860 --> 06:16.437
and your friends have
all been moving away.

06:16.455 --> 06:17.871
- Or dying.
- Jazmine!

06:18.600 --> 06:19.695
I'm sorry.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.466
I'm sorry, I... did I say that out loud?

06:22.481 --> 06:23.560
- Keep it up.
- I did it again.

06:23.575 --> 06:25.104
- Keep it up.
- I'll be quiet.

06:25.121 --> 06:26.220
Okay.

06:27.085 --> 06:30.396
Well, if he had come to me,
and we had talked about this,

06:30.455 --> 06:32.360
then I would have been
much more open to it.

06:32.762 --> 06:33.900
I mean...

06:34.633 --> 06:35.709
This is just...

06:36.402 --> 06:37.445
insensitive.

06:37.556 --> 06:40.183
It's... it's just so rude to me.

06:40.371 --> 06:42.887
Talk about no respect for your wife

06:42.924 --> 06:44.568
of all these years.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.256
I can't do it...

06:46.470 --> 06:48.960
- on that principle alone.
- On that?

06:49.245 --> 06:50.317
This is just...

06:50.442 --> 06:52.561
- this is just so...
- Uncle Curtis.

06:56.327 --> 06:57.345
Yeah.

06:58.202 --> 07:00.347
Okay. So, to be clear,

07:00.369 --> 07:01.482
you're not going to move

07:01.501 --> 07:03.140
- because you're offended?
- Janine...

07:03.155 --> 07:04.190
That's what it sounds like to me.

07:04.315 --> 07:05.351
- Okay.
- Okay, you know?

07:05.365 --> 07:07.577
- How many times has he done this?
- Mom, that ain't right.

07:07.577 --> 07:09.554
- You did not just ask her that.
- Right.

07:10.522 --> 07:12.105
Wrong question.

07:13.124 --> 07:14.229
Listen...

07:14.500 --> 07:15.830
Just think about it.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.790
That's it, just think about it. Instead
of saying "no" because you're mad

07:18.818 --> 07:20.416
or you feel like you need
to teach him a lesson.

07:21.056 --> 07:23.106
Curtis needs to be
taught several lessons.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.819
Hey, have y'all heard the
one about the old dogs?

07:28.708 --> 07:31.485
Have you heard the one
about sticks and stones?

07:32.863 --> 07:35.291
- Actually, no, Mama, I have heard that one.
- Oh.

07:36.212 --> 07:38.474
Well, they didn't tell you
that the "breaking bones"

07:38.502 --> 07:40.763
was because you was in
grown folks's business.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.498
This family... this family, you know...

07:46.014 --> 07:47.534
[CLEARS THROAT] We need Jesus.

07:47.539 --> 07:49.718
There's too much
violence in this family.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.765
I cannot let Curtis
think that this was okay.

07:55.571 --> 07:58.440
I can't... [LAUGHS] Even
if I do love Florida,

07:58.458 --> 08:00.637
and I do love this place,

08:01.268 --> 08:03.180
I can't. I can't do it
because then he's gonna do

08:03.194 --> 08:05.041
something else that I don't like.

08:05.069 --> 08:08.284
Child, you might end up on a
trolley boat to Alaska if you don't.

08:11.029 --> 08:13.295
What happened to that vocal rest premise

08:13.318 --> 08:16.293
- that we were dealing with?
- Just wait. Just, um...

08:17.421 --> 08:20.397
I really love what you
talking about right now.

08:21.378 --> 08:22.350
- Baby...
- Listen, listen.

08:22.364 --> 08:24.584
Mom, I'm sorry, but ain't no man
gonna be treating me like this.

08:24.593 --> 08:26.514
- And I appreciate th... And I appreciate that.
- No man!

08:26.528 --> 08:28.988
But if you don't be quiet, no
one's gonna have a chance to.

08:30.231 --> 08:32.345
- Got it. I got it.
- Okay.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.402
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

08:38.162 --> 08:40.124
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

08:40.174 --> 08:42.472
Yeah, come on, kids.
Time for your snack.

08:42.486 --> 08:44.526
[KIDS CHEERING]

08:46.916 --> 08:48.496
They hungry.

08:48.915 --> 08:50.131
Y'all know nothing.

08:53.531 --> 08:54.949
- Hey.
- Yeah?

08:55.400 --> 08:56.676
Are you all right?

08:56.801 --> 08:58.256
Yeah, mm-hmm.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.752
What happened to your face?

09:01.089 --> 09:02.756
Oh... [LAUGHS]

09:03.502 --> 09:05.326
I'm so clumsy.

09:07.542 --> 09:08.726
No, ma'am.

09:09.186 --> 09:10.503
Did he hit her?

09:10.802 --> 09:12.682
He just got mad, that's all.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.635
I... I forgot and didn't lock the door,

09:14.653 --> 09:17.209
- and I'm always forgetting things.
- Nyla...

09:17.651 --> 09:21.395
Nobody is supposed to
put their hands on you.

09:21.413 --> 09:24.296
Yeah, ever, okay. I
don't care what you did.

09:24.319 --> 09:26.691
And don't make excuses for him,
either. Now, where did he go?

09:26.714 --> 09:28.230
- Um, Jazzie?
- Where?! Where he at?!

09:28.253 --> 09:30.237
- No, I said, "where he at?!"
- Girl, yo!

09:30.269 --> 09:31.928
He gonna hit you,
then run? Where he go?!

09:31.969 --> 09:34.871
I'm fine, I'm fine, I am. I'm fine.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.510
I'm sorry. She's gonna calm down.

09:37.505 --> 09:40.881
Mom, this is not right,
okay? This ain't right.

09:41.724 --> 09:43.662
Now, once again, where'd he go?

09:43.699 --> 09:45.939
I'm fine. I'm fine, I am.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.609
- I'm fine.
- Look at you.

09:47.923 --> 09:49.134
Nyla?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.350
Mm-hmm. There he go.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.182
Come on. We ain't finished talking.

09:55.215 --> 09:57.135
- I don't think so.
- Me, either.

09:57.177 --> 09:58.812
And I know so.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.724
Nyla, I need to talk to you.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.746
And I said you're not.

10:09.935 --> 10:12.288
- Baby...
- Did he just say "baby"?

10:14.328 --> 10:16.705
Now, I know this fool
didn't just say "baby."

10:16.737 --> 10:18.717
- Uh-uh!
- Jazmine!

10:19.661 --> 10:21.840
When did you become an old
black woman from the south?

10:21.854 --> 10:24.166
[LAUGHS]

10:24.291 --> 10:25.410
Right.

10:25.488 --> 10:27.906
Well, that is my birthright! Okay?

10:28.500 --> 10:31.015
And I don't like this at all.

10:32.650 --> 10:34.530
Neither do we, okay?

10:35.055 --> 10:37.090
And she will not be talking to you.

10:37.122 --> 10:39.932
- Yeah, we ain't having that.
- Please, please.

10:40.102 --> 10:42.728
Nyla, I... I just want to apologize.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.865
Well, it ain't accepted. So bye-bye.

10:45.491 --> 10:47.969
- Baby, this ain't none of their business, it's...
- Oh, okay, you one of them deaf dudes.

10:47.974 --> 10:48.974
You didn't hear what I just said?

10:48.988 --> 10:50.807
- Little girl.
- Right, you know what?

10:50.853 --> 10:53.114
Ha, I like this whole defensive
thing you got going on,

10:53.123 --> 10:54.583
but right now, you're doing too much.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.421
- I am?
- Yeah.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.356
Let us handle this, okay?

10:59.139 --> 11:00.105
Thank you.

11:00.106 --> 11:01.995
Okay, listen, I see
what y'all trying to do,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.255
but you trying to go old-school.

11:03.255 --> 11:06.046
I think we need to hit this
dude with the new way, all right?

11:06.120 --> 11:08.921
Jazmine, please. Please...

11:09.381 --> 11:10.726
Okay, go on.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.706
Go ahead and try and teach
kKng James to the New Testament.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.134
Go on, see how that works.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.350
- I got you.
- Listen to me, young man.

11:19.385 --> 11:22.246
Hi, I'm Ella. What's your name?

11:22.292 --> 11:23.634
My name's not your business.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.870
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

11:26.893 --> 11:30.589
Ooh, I'm scared. [LAUGHS]

11:30.630 --> 11:34.033
Well, listen, Not Your
Business, she, um...

11:34.424 --> 11:37.158
She's not going to be
talking to you today.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.621
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

11:38.650 --> 11:40.659
As I said, this is not your business.

11:40.688 --> 11:43.769
- Well, I'm making it my business.
- Okay.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.052
Baby. You gonna let these
people come between us?

11:46.066 --> 11:48.083
Well, looks like we've
already come between you.

11:48.111 --> 11:49.129
And we ain't moving.

11:49.138 --> 11:51.565
Baby, please, you know I'm sorry.

11:51.579 --> 11:52.818
I know, I know.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.559
No, lady, you do not know.
You don't know anything.

11:55.577 --> 11:58.911
- Can we just talk for a second, Nyla, you and me?
- Okay.

11:58.976 --> 12:02.135
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no. I need to talk to him.

12:02.168 --> 12:03.821
It's okay. It's okay.

12:03.946 --> 12:05.549
This will only make him more upset.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.299
Uh-uh, no. You need to step.

12:07.547 --> 12:08.906
Okay?

12:09.274 --> 12:11.803
- Who... who is this little girl?
- Right, little girl.

12:11.859 --> 12:13.738
This little girl is old enough to know

12:13.752 --> 12:15.953
that you ain't supposed to let
anybody put their hands on you.

12:15.972 --> 12:18.086
- Okay, now I said...
- This ain't none of your business.

12:18.307 --> 12:20.061
- Know what? I'm gonna...
- No, no, no, no!

12:20.098 --> 12:21.941
Listen, see, what I need
you to do right now...

12:22.001 --> 12:24.579
Hey, focus. Right here. Mama, okay?

12:24.602 --> 12:26.284
I need you go to over
there with the kids.

12:26.965 --> 12:29.033
But, Mom, I really think y'all
need my help with this dude.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.646
No, I really think you need to go.

12:31.581 --> 12:33.653
- Are you... you sure?
- Exodus.

12:33.676 --> 12:35.251
- 'Cause, Mama, I'm really...
- Jazmine!

12:35.274 --> 12:38.774
- I been doing that cardio...
- Jazmine, go, now.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.826
- Okay.
- The other way.

12:44.046 --> 12:45.543
All right, I'm going.

12:46.915 --> 12:48.803
But I will be right by that door...

12:52.189 --> 12:53.326
Watching.

12:57.541 --> 12:59.342
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no.

12:59.401 --> 13:00.406
Where are you going?

13:00.424 --> 13:01.976
- To talk to him.
- No.

13:02.101 --> 13:03.984
Why can't you talk right here?

13:04.109 --> 13:07.052
- Well, he wanted to talk in private.
- I don't care what he wants to do.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.415
Why?

13:08.540 --> 13:10.962
A real man would just say
what he has to say right here.

13:10.976 --> 13:13.454
So say it, big, tough man.

13:13.998 --> 13:15.269
I'll be right back.

13:15.283 --> 13:17.304
No, no, Nyla. She's right.

13:17.493 --> 13:19.578
You're right. I'll say it.

13:19.795 --> 13:20.844
I'm sorry.

13:21.245 --> 13:23.286
Nyla, you know that I love you.

13:24.682 --> 13:25.765
Just...

13:26.064 --> 13:29.517
- Don't do it again, okay?
- I won't, promise.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.307
Okay, uh... I gotta get to work.

13:32.321 --> 13:33.910
Just be out of here in
time to pick up the kids.

13:34.274 --> 13:35.292
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:36.052 --> 13:37.890
- Love you.
- Love you.

13:41.229 --> 13:44.751
Okay. Okay, okay. Nyla, I... I...

13:44.811 --> 13:46.768
I know you don't really
know us that well.

13:46.791 --> 13:48.648
- No, no, no, I don't. Wait, wait, now.
- Girl, listen.

13:50.186 --> 13:51.788
You cannot just let this happen.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.672
It's not right. You
cannot let this happen.

13:53.691 --> 13:57.141
- I know. I know, but I...
- No, no, no, no buts.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.794
- But I did leave the door unlocked.
- I don't care.

13:59.803 --> 14:02.949
You... it does not matter. He's not
supposed to put his hands on you.

14:02.971 --> 14:05.799
- I know, but I ha...
- Nyla, but what?

14:05.808 --> 14:07.061
I have two kids,

14:07.255 --> 14:09.507
and he took us in,
and he is good to them.

14:10.396 --> 14:12.303
You know he gave us a
place to stay, Miss Ella.

14:13.003 --> 14:14.417
We were homeless.

14:15.237 --> 14:18.640
He's okay. He just
gets upset. That's all.

14:18.714 --> 14:20.567
No, no, no. This is not all right.

14:20.584 --> 14:22.604
This is not all right. That's not all.

14:22.961 --> 14:24.827
What do your kids think?

14:25.420 --> 14:28.372
They're just happy that they
have a roof over heads today.

14:28.562 --> 14:30.818
What do they say when he's hitting you?

14:31.930 --> 14:34.716
- He doesn't hit me.
- Oh, no, no, no. Mm.

14:34.779 --> 14:38.400
Don't you dare say that
this is the first time.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.647
No, I was gonna say
that he is respectful.

14:42.384 --> 14:43.697
Respectful?

14:43.822 --> 14:46.023
He doesn't do it in front of them.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.089
Oh, no.

14:50.018 --> 14:53.673
- Oh, no.
- Baby, you got this all wrong.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.495
I mean... I mean, all
wrong. This is not okay.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.556
- You don't know what I've been through.
- No, I don't.

15:02.953 --> 15:04.277
No, I do not.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.707
But I do know that you
don't have not have to keep

15:06.724 --> 15:08.648
going through it.

15:11.382 --> 15:14.543
Where will me and my kids go? Hmm?

15:15.689 --> 15:18.546
Wait. We can't do another shelter.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.296
All right? We just can't.

15:20.307 --> 15:22.242
I just have to be more careful,

15:22.311 --> 15:26.302
okay, and do what he says.
And this will be fine.

15:26.308 --> 15:28.351
- This will not be fine.
- I'm sorry!

15:29.376 --> 15:30.850
- This will not...
- Sorry.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.629
If you'll excuse me.

15:36.406 --> 15:37.695
Wow.

15:43.457 --> 15:45.841
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Wow. I hope she gets help.

15:46.336 --> 15:50.095
Oh, she's gonna have... lots of help.

15:53.607 --> 15:57.084
- Baby!
- Mnm-mnm. Mnm-mnm.

15:57.136 --> 15:59.618
I saw the RV outside, so
I knew you was in here.

15:59.641 --> 16:01.575
Curtis, don't. Don't
come in here with this.

16:01.604 --> 16:03.913
- Don't "baby" me.
- But, baby, can I finish?

16:03.924 --> 16:06.699
Can I just finish what
I gotta say, please?

16:08.208 --> 16:11.431
Okay? I'm sorry. All right?

16:12.168 --> 16:13.648
- Okay?
- Curtis...

16:13.677 --> 16:15.882
No, let me apologize.

16:17.003 --> 16:20.003
I'm sorry I didn't talk
to you first, baby, okay?

16:21.920 --> 16:24.580
We can go back to Atlanta.
I'll talk to the realtor.

16:25.046 --> 16:26.745
Try to get the money back.

16:27.637 --> 16:30.441
I should have considered your
feelings, Ella. I know that.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.756
Baby, forgive me.

16:34.529 --> 16:36.146
Is that really him talking?

16:37.666 --> 16:41.580
Yeah, 'cause his big dream
turned out to be a big bust.

16:43.918 --> 16:45.190
Oh, what's up, y'all?

16:45.230 --> 16:46.854
Can we go ahead and
head back to Atlanta,

16:46.883 --> 16:48.638
'cause my friends... they waiting on me.

16:48.661 --> 16:50.290
And so are mine.

16:50.330 --> 16:52.501
Well, before we leave, I think
we should all use the bathroom,

16:52.535 --> 16:54.286
'cause you know how Uncle Curtis is.

16:56.530 --> 16:58.689
Yeah, and we don't want
to talk about number two.

17:00.974 --> 17:03.259
Charging you $95...

17:04.491 --> 17:06.201
- A drop.
- Okay.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.155
Um...

17:09.613 --> 17:11.498
no. You guys...

17:12.719 --> 17:14.301
You guys go home.

17:19.407 --> 17:20.963
We're gonna stay.

17:22.633 --> 17:23.968
Say what?

17:24.848 --> 17:26.253
Yes, Curtis.

17:26.289 --> 17:30.163
Maybe this is the next moment in
life that I've been praying about.

17:31.159 --> 17:34.498
I've raised Calvin and C.J.

17:34.538 --> 17:37.039
And definitely helped to raise our kids.

17:37.117 --> 17:38.753
You can say that's right.

17:39.121 --> 17:40.601
- Helped?
- Come on, now.

17:47.424 --> 17:48.794
Baby...

17:49.261 --> 17:51.086
- You sure?
- Yes.

17:52.594 --> 17:53.884
Yes.

17:55.167 --> 17:58.098
Maybe it's time to try
to help somebody else.

18:01.817 --> 18:04.728
No, don't... don't move. Don't
try to get over here close to me.

18:05.896 --> 18:07.646
'Cause...

18:07.992 --> 18:11.434
I'm still mad at you for
how you disrespected me.

18:11.559 --> 18:13.809
I... I apologize. I'm sorry.

18:13.990 --> 18:17.188
Well, wait till you see that
laundromat. Then you really gonna be mad.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.026
Hush in your head. Say something else.

18:21.035 --> 18:23.453
- You saw the place.
- Say something else!

18:23.739 --> 18:25.232
Curtis?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.723
Yes, baby?

18:29.814 --> 18:31.666
- You want to stay?
- Yes.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.304
Yes!

18:37.463 --> 18:41.210
Yeah, but you gonna take me to a hotel.

18:43.052 --> 18:44.290
The kid's right here.

18:44.319 --> 18:47.574
- Don't say it in front of the kids.
- Until the house is ready.

18:47.577 --> 18:49.261
Nice hotel, baby.

- Are you sure you're staying, Aunt Ella?
- Yes, baby, yes.

19:04.661 --> 19:07.032
We're gonna stay right here in Florida.

19:07.157 --> 19:11.443
It's not the moon, so...
We will see you soon.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.621
Okay.

19:13.414 --> 19:15.247
Just go on. Go, go, go.

19:15.285 --> 19:16.905

Mm-hmm. What is it, honey?
