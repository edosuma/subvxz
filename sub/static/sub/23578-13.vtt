WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:04.662
Okay, start to shut up, everybody.

00:05.146 --> 00:06.946
Here we go. Yeah.

00:08.969 --> 00:12.337
All right, come and get 'em, you dogs.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.061
You are now free to begin learning biology.

00:17.971 --> 00:20.055
Yeah, get 'em. Get 'em.

00:20.869 --> 00:23.041
Yeah, bunch of animals.

00:26.747 --> 00:28.931
You see, my plucky little cherubs,

00:29.216 --> 00:31.673
I am outta here.

00:32.485 --> 00:35.820
Yeah, our revenge mission was a success.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.690
Miles is leaving his post at Stanford,

00:38.872 --> 00:40.571
and I am to assume my rightful perch

00:40.640 --> 00:42.373
atop the philosophy department

00:42.442 --> 00:44.575
where my intellect will
be worshiped by students

00:44.644 --> 00:47.025
that don't dry hump
their pillows every night.

00:47.203 --> 00:49.771
Uh, it's my understanding
that an academic chair

00:49.839 --> 00:52.043
is more admin work than
actual student time.

00:52.215 --> 00:54.115
I'll miss you least of all, Scarecrow.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.507
Does this mean we'll get
an actual biology teacher?

00:56.645 --> 00:58.344
Yes, yes, you're finally gonna be taught

00:58.413 --> 01:00.380
by someone who couldn't
get into med school.

01:00.405 --> 01:01.426
Can you even?

01:02.817 --> 01:04.349
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.274 --> 01:18.264
Gosh.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.167
Seems like only yesterday
we were stumbling our way

01:21.236 --> 01:22.769
through our first Miles mission.

01:22.837 --> 01:25.071
Ah, so many good ones, you know.

01:25.140 --> 01:28.207
I liked the planting-his-DNA-
on-a-dead-body one.

01:28.276 --> 01:30.410
I still walk the Maumee River every morning

01:30.478 --> 01:32.545
- looking for a floater.
- Ah, do ya?

01:32.614 --> 01:35.448
I certainly enjoyed our online love affair.

01:35.517 --> 01:38.117
He still thinks I'm a
32-year-old named Linda.

01:55.710 --> 01:58.964
Colin, will you go to the
Sadie Hawkins dance with me?

02:01.048 --> 02:03.382
- Uh-huh.
- Ya pranked!

02:08.889 --> 02:10.556
You really think that a drummer

02:10.625 --> 02:12.339
would go to a dance with a woodwind?

02:23.704 --> 02:26.272
Wow. Man, they must have
rehearsed the crap out of that.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.141
Now who's the chick with
the strong sense of self?

02:29.210 --> 02:31.343
- Her name's Dallas.
- She's the worst.

02:31.412 --> 02:34.146
- The whole drum corps is.
- One time I yawned,

02:34.215 --> 02:36.519
and they threw my mashed
potatoes in my mouth.

02:36.519 --> 02:37.685
Now wait a second. Are you guys saying that

02:37.753 --> 02:39.386
the drum corps are the cool kids?

02:39.455 --> 02:41.055
- 'Cause that's nuts.
- Well, they're above us

02:41.123 --> 02:42.323
on the hierarchy.

02:42.391 --> 02:43.977
The newspaper kids are above them.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.790
I'm not really sure who's at the top,

02:45.790 --> 02:48.324
but I'd like to think it's
some kind of sex-having athlete.

02:48.392 --> 02:50.059
No, no, no, no, no, look. Forget the whole

02:50.127 --> 02:51.427
food chain/hierarchy thing, okay.

02:51.495 --> 02:52.895
Have you guys absorbed nothing

02:52.964 --> 02:54.458
from all the missions that we've done?

02:54.865 --> 02:56.498
There's no
greater pick-me-up

02:56.567 --> 02:58.767
than taking down somebody
who's wronged you.

02:58.836 --> 03:00.141
But, Mr. Griffin...

03:00.662 --> 03:01.870
She has a nose ring.

03:01.939 --> 03:03.105
Forget the nose ring.

03:03.174 --> 03:04.373
Don't be intimidated by that.

03:04.442 --> 03:05.841
That's exactly what she wants.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.177
Now we're gonna get
revenge on the drum corps.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.512
That's what we're gonna do. Yeah.

03:10.768 --> 03:13.135
I'm gonna pull you guys off
the bottom of that food chain.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.596
Technically, we're above the Russian kids.

03:15.665 --> 03:18.329
Not for long. They're acclimating fast.

03:18.601 --> 03:19.835
Commies.

03:20.532 --> 03:22.667
<i>This is a going away video for Jack.</i>

03:22.667 --> 03:23.667
<i>Oh.</i>

03:24.427 --> 03:26.169
<i>Jack, I've never had the opportunity</i>

03:26.237 --> 03:27.537
<i>to say this to
you face-to-face,</i>

03:27.606 --> 03:29.339
<i>but your penis is clearly visible</i>

03:29.407 --> 03:32.323
<i>through your sweatpants.
Okay, have fun in Hollywood.</i>

03:32.544 --> 03:33.543
Wait, what was that?

03:33.612 --> 03:35.248
Rewind. Freeze it.

03:35.647 --> 03:37.313
There. Do you see that?

03:37.382 --> 03:38.748
- Mm-mm.
- Zoom in.

03:38.817 --> 03:40.375
Okay.

03:41.319 --> 03:42.952
Oh, my God.

03:43.021 --> 03:44.787
- Is that a ghost?
- Zoom in.

03:44.856 --> 03:46.322
Ooh.

03:46.391 --> 03:47.624
- No.
- Mm-mm.

03:47.692 --> 03:49.425
That's crazy, right?

03:49.879 --> 03:51.979
We all agree that ghosts aren't real.

03:52.048 --> 03:53.447
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:53.516 --> 03:55.970
- Let's just get back to editing.
- Yeah, okay.

03:57.886 --> 03:58.953
Ah.

03:59.022 --> 04:01.582
Well, good morning, beautiful songbird.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.191
You sound just like the loon
that visited our lake house.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.659
- Oh, yeah?
- He died last summer.

04:05.728 --> 04:07.528
We're pretty sure that
a power line got him.

04:07.597 --> 04:10.564
We found, like, a basket of ribs.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.083
- Like, a charred...
- Helen, Helen, Helen, I...

04:13.583 --> 04:16.237
So, get this. I'm finally leaving Toledo.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.872
- Yeah, I'm free.
- What?

04:17.940 --> 04:19.807
You've only been here three little months.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.208
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Aww.

04:21.277 --> 04:23.244
I once took a nap longer than that.

04:23.728 --> 04:26.065
Of course, I had just
slammed into the straight side

04:26.065 --> 04:28.299
- of a water ski ramp.
- Uh-huh.

04:28.368 --> 04:31.068
My eyes were open and I
was talking, but I was dead.

04:31.481 --> 04:34.482
As I was saying, um, yeah, I'm out of here.

04:34.551 --> 04:36.884
I'm gonna go head the
Stanford philosophy department.

04:36.953 --> 04:40.052
- Hey, not too shabby, huh?
- I know.

04:40.077 --> 04:41.443
Yeah.

04:41.468 --> 04:43.168
I'd say you're going to greener pastures,

04:43.193 --> 04:44.625
but California is on fire.

04:44.961 --> 04:47.318
- Okay.
- Hey, when you leave,

04:47.816 --> 04:51.184
could I please have that
big, fancy professor throne?

04:51.252 --> 04:53.419
- Professor thro...
- Oh, my massage chair?

04:53.488 --> 04:55.054
- Yes.
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

04:55.123 --> 04:57.973
Yeah, you could... you
could really stand to relax.

04:57.998 --> 04:58.995
Oh, thank you.

05:03.306 --> 05:04.908
- Ah.
- Hi, Ralph.

05:05.666 --> 05:08.467
At first, I couldn't
believe you were leaving.

05:08.819 --> 05:10.041
You know, and then I...

05:11.372 --> 05:12.772
took a sharp turn to anger.

05:13.088 --> 05:14.806
Oh, did you punch a hole in the wall?

05:14.807 --> 05:16.239
Oh, tha... no,

05:16.308 --> 05:18.408
I thought it'd be cool
to have an office hammock.

05:18.477 --> 05:20.077
Then I found out the hard way that

05:20.145 --> 05:22.412
drywall does not support a human body.

05:22.481 --> 05:24.147
- Mm.
- But now I've moved on

05:24.216 --> 05:26.188
to the third stage of grief;

05:26.652 --> 05:29.472
bargaining. Jack, I can offer you

05:29.688 --> 05:31.922
two parking spaces.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.790
Now, granted, they're not adjacent.

05:33.859 --> 05:35.625
- Let's see.
- Six-figure salary

05:35.694 --> 05:38.137
or a second floating parking spot.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.727
Okay, I get it, Jack. All right?

05:39.728 --> 05:41.754
I want what's best for you too.

05:42.126 --> 05:44.658
Look, could you at least impart some

05:45.091 --> 05:46.652
words of Ivy League wisdom

05:46.697 --> 05:48.330
to the students at the hit '90s movie

05:48.399 --> 05:50.099
Congo-themed dance this Friday?

05:50.334 --> 05:52.031
Yes... That I can do.

05:52.094 --> 05:54.335
Yeah. Maybe I'll teach 'em
about deterministic living.

05:54.405 --> 05:56.305
Yeah. Or maybe just, uh...

05:56.373 --> 05:57.806
teach 'em about deodorant.

05:57.875 --> 06:01.510
Ralph, the cash for
gold guy is on line three.

06:01.579 --> 06:03.145
Did you already take my chair, Helen?

06:03.214 --> 06:05.047
Oh, I did. Oh, it's so comfortable.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.816
It's like my hind end is
smiling from ear to ear.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.847
All right, everybody, what have we got

06:12.872 --> 06:14.241
for revenge against Dallas?

06:14.651 --> 06:16.033
We could adjust her metronome

06:16.119 --> 06:17.463
so she drums slightly off tempo.

06:17.495 --> 06:19.353
Hmm. That seems like your second

06:19.513 --> 06:21.413
bad idea of the day there, Colin.

06:21.854 --> 06:23.720
No, come on, guys. We need to go bigger.

06:24.066 --> 06:26.291
Did you ever see the movie "Carrie"?

06:26.747 --> 06:29.514
We could stuff the ballot
box so Dallas is voted queen.

06:29.717 --> 06:32.017
And then when she's on
stage getting crowned,

06:32.086 --> 06:34.587
we can humiliate her by covering her...

06:34.655 --> 06:36.422
In pig's blood.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.865
Yeah. Yeah. Whoo.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.160
Anybody else just get goose bumps?

06:41.229 --> 06:42.299
Yeah.

06:42.299 --> 06:43.732
Where will we get pig's blood?

06:43.801 --> 06:46.468
My dad's butcher shop.
We have troughs of it.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.336
Let's do it.

06:48.405 --> 06:50.138
Oh, you know what, guys, keep it going.

06:50.207 --> 06:52.140
I gotta take this call. It's Stanford.

06:53.150 --> 06:54.779
Man, it feels good to say that.

06:54.981 --> 06:55.995
Mm.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.417
- Miles. <i>
- Jack, Jack.</i>

06:59.486 --> 07:01.061
<i>You'll never guess who I'm with.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:04.122
Dean Richardson, hi. Love that tie.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.957
- I'm digging it. <i>
- Well, thank you, Jack.</i>

07:06.026 --> 07:08.821
<i>This shade of red is
Stanford Cardinal.</i>

07:12.632 --> 07:15.059
<i>This guy.</i>

07:15.468 --> 07:16.837
<i>Aw, fun, fun.</i>

07:16.837 --> 07:20.028
<i>Well, Jack, I'm on my way
out, but we are really</i>

07:20.068 --> 07:21.734
<i>looking forward to
having your with us.</i>

07:21.803 --> 07:23.488
<i>You are gonna love having him.</i>

07:23.520 --> 07:26.273
<i>Jack and I are like the same soul</i>

07:26.341 --> 07:28.477
<i>- in two separate bodies.</i>
- Yeah.

07:29.044 --> 07:30.917
<i>Well, Jack, I'm off.</i>

07:32.747 --> 07:35.048
<i>Hey.</i>

07:35.116 --> 07:37.550
<i>Jack, between you and I,</i>

07:37.619 --> 07:39.452
<i>Stanford are really scrutinizing</i>

07:39.521 --> 07:41.454
<i>their faculty's
behavior at the moment.</i>

07:41.523 --> 07:43.423
<i>Turns out one of the
English professors</i>

07:43.491 --> 07:45.425
<i>has been using his faculty website</i>

07:45.493 --> 07:47.340
<i>- to sell ecstasy.</i>
- Wow.

07:47.662 --> 07:48.828
Seems like that's what the dean was on.

07:48.897 --> 07:50.230
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:50.298 --> 07:52.398
<i>But, seriously, keep your nose clean</i>

07:52.467 --> 07:54.200
<i>for the next couple
of days, all right,</i>

07:54.269 --> 07:55.768
<i>you saucy little mongoose.</i>

07:55.837 --> 07:58.771
Will do, you... You fuzzy old, uh...

07:58.840 --> 07:59.973
<i>- Go on. Do... what was it.</i>
- Nope.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.219
I'm not gonna do this.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.280
Yo, you want to hear

08:07.349 --> 08:09.616
- what we've got so far?
- So we'll all go to the dance

08:09.684 --> 08:11.084
- as a group-
- Oh, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

08:11.152 --> 08:13.152
Nope. <i>No mas.</i> <i>No mas.</i> Yeah.

08:13.221 --> 08:15.622
Turns out my Stanford job
is on the line here, guys.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.123
So as much as it kills me to say this,

08:17.192 --> 08:20.426
I cannot douse a teenage girl in blood.

08:20.796 --> 08:23.230
I'm gonna be over here picking
out my California bang pad,

08:23.298 --> 08:24.965
so it's time for you guys to nut up

08:25.367 --> 08:26.625
and do this on your own.

08:27.269 --> 08:28.902
All right? Let's see here.

08:28.970 --> 08:30.303
Bang pad.

08:30.372 --> 08:31.804
Bang pads.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.873
Oh, nope, nope, nope.
That's not a good website.

08:33.942 --> 08:35.475
Okay, so what should we use

08:35.543 --> 08:37.409
as background music for Jack's video?

08:37.479 --> 08:39.044
My vote is the "What a man, what a man,

08:39.114 --> 08:40.647
"what a man, what a man,
what a mighty good man" song.

08:40.715 --> 08:42.881
Michelle, that's too many "what a mans."

08:42.951 --> 08:44.884
I can't help it. I'm rattled.

08:44.953 --> 08:46.386
All I can think about is that ghost.

08:46.454 --> 08:48.588
There has to be a easy explanation for it.

08:48.966 --> 08:51.729
- It was a glare.
- Yeah, plus ghosts only haunt

08:51.729 --> 08:53.028
places that they've died,

08:53.097 --> 08:55.331
and no one's ever died at Whitlock, so...

08:55.631 --> 08:58.021
Unless you count Beehive Beverly

08:58.569 --> 09:00.102
who died of a headfire.

09:00.171 --> 09:01.570
A headfire?

09:01.639 --> 09:03.231
Oh, it's Whitlock legend.

09:03.775 --> 09:05.901
It was 1964

09:06.210 --> 09:07.443
and our Home Ec teacher,

09:07.511 --> 09:09.044
Beverly Sills, was a real tomboy.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.947
Now, that didn't set well
with Principal Thorson.

09:12.132 --> 09:14.984
So he made her put her
hair up into a beehive.

09:15.052 --> 09:16.318
And one fateful day,

09:16.387 --> 09:19.254
she was pulling out zucchini
muffins from the oven

09:19.323 --> 09:20.823
and her beehive caught on fire

09:20.891 --> 09:23.225
and flash-melted down to the scalp.

09:23.294 --> 09:25.909
- Oh.
- Some people say that

09:26.397 --> 09:29.031
she still roams these halls...

09:30.368 --> 09:33.700
Cursed to always wear a beehive.

09:36.675 --> 09:37.745
Ha!

09:39.210 --> 09:40.776
So we'll rig the buckets of blood

09:40.845 --> 09:42.244
the day before in the gym.

09:42.313 --> 09:44.013
We'll get in there by crawling
through the duct system.

09:44.081 --> 09:46.682
- This plan sucks.
- Your attitude sucks.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.417
Okay, dude, stop fighting.
We need to figure out

09:48.486 --> 09:50.519
- how to get into the gym.
- The duct system!

09:50.588 --> 09:53.222
Okay, guys, guys, guys. I'm
not getting involved here.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.823
I'm just letting you
know that every teacher

09:54.892 --> 09:56.925
keeps a master key in their top drawer,

09:56.994 --> 09:59.150
so steal it from them
when they're not looking.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.516
Bingo.

10:33.187 --> 10:34.546
Dudes, like, seriously, disperse.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.186
All right? Y'all looking shady as hell.

10:39.918 --> 10:40.950
Well done, ladies.

10:41.019 --> 10:42.252
Oh, God.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.254
Durbs, put a bell on that collar.

10:44.322 --> 10:45.722
Ooh, my hiccups are gone.

10:45.791 --> 10:47.223
Hey, guys, I'm sorry to scare you,

10:47.292 --> 10:49.635
but how great is this? I mean, it's...

10:49.635 --> 10:51.501
This is like really being
in the movie "Congo."

10:51.571 --> 10:53.871
Durbadook, we have an issue.

10:54.156 --> 10:56.945
- Whitlock is haunted.
- It's Beehive Beverly.

10:56.945 --> 11:00.047
Guys, there's no such
thing as Beehive Beverly.

11:00.116 --> 11:01.449
So there's no Beehive...

11:01.518 --> 11:02.850
Let's...

11:02.919 --> 11:05.086
Let's not say her name a third time though.

11:05.155 --> 11:07.121
You know, just in case.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.365
Silly. It's...

11:16.277 --> 11:19.934
Whoa, we are definitely not
gonna get the deposits back

11:20.003 --> 11:21.335
on these gorilla suits.

11:21.404 --> 11:24.005
This one smells like egg salad.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.538
Oh, boy. Hello, everyone.

11:27.460 --> 11:31.412
The king and queen of the
Sadie Hawkins "Congo" Dance

11:31.481 --> 11:33.114
inspired by the movie

11:33.183 --> 11:35.334
based on the book by Michael Crichton...

11:35.752 --> 11:37.051
the winners are:

11:37.120 --> 11:40.188
Dallas Chaffee and Joshua McLees.

11:40.256 --> 11:41.862
Get your butts up here.

11:42.325 --> 11:43.483
Good job.

11:56.688 --> 12:00.090
Yes, congratulations, Dallas and Joshua!

12:06.465 --> 12:07.537
Wow.

12:13.305 --> 12:14.404
Why isn't it working?

12:14.473 --> 12:16.222
- Pull harder.
- I'm trying.

12:16.710 --> 12:17.907
It must be stuck.

12:18.890 --> 12:22.464
Is everybody having fun
in the Lost City of Zinj?

12:22.848 --> 12:25.882
♪ Amy love "Congo" movie ♪

12:25.951 --> 12:27.584
None of us get that.

12:27.652 --> 12:29.619
We have not seen film. Get to point.

12:29.688 --> 12:31.421
Wow, even the... Even the Russian kids.

12:31.490 --> 12:34.557
You are acclimating quickly.
Well, without further ado,

12:34.626 --> 12:37.527
I would like to introduce
our keynote speaker.

12:37.741 --> 12:41.679
Please welcome my
ex-roomie, Mr. Jack Griffin.

12:44.269 --> 12:45.753
All right, guys. Oh.

12:47.374 --> 12:48.671
Okay. Hi.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.141
I guess my message to you is pretty simple.

12:51.209 --> 12:53.043
Um, you gotta get out of Toledo.

12:53.111 --> 12:54.744
Just get the hell out
of here any way you can.

12:54.813 --> 12:58.748
I got out using my good
looks and my wit and my charm,

12:58.817 --> 13:00.316
but you guys don't have that,

13:00.385 --> 13:01.951
so you'll have to come
up with something else.

13:02.211 --> 13:03.286
Who are you?

13:03.355 --> 13:04.761
You know, you could join a circus.

13:04.786 --> 13:06.169
Yeah, that could be cool.

13:06.169 --> 13:08.465
I know those gypsies tend
to hire, you know, their own,

13:08.511 --> 13:10.378
but you could marry in.
Yeah, that's one way in.

13:10.447 --> 13:12.046
Maybe you wouldn't even
have to work at the circus.

13:12.115 --> 13:13.948
You could just, you
know... You'd make dinner

13:14.017 --> 13:16.355
for when the gypsy comes home.
Just, you know, keep 'em happy.

13:16.355 --> 13:18.750
Otherwise, they'll steal your baby.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.657
It's been a lot of fun,

13:20.726 --> 13:23.220
but I'm sure, sure glad to
be leaving this damn place.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.313
Uh, okay. See ya.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.765
Okay, uh, well...

13:28.834 --> 13:31.868
gypsy's, I think, are an
unjustly maligned group.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.271
They gave us the tambourine.

13:34.340 --> 13:38.208
And if you ask me, Toledo
is a great place to live.

13:38.277 --> 13:39.910
Jack, the ladies have put together

13:39.979 --> 13:41.845
a little bon voyage surprise gift for you,

13:41.914 --> 13:44.281
so take it away, ladies. All right.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.382
Thank you, Durbs.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.684
Oh, Harvard Jack, we're gonna miss you.

13:47.753 --> 13:50.120
We made you this hella
tight good-bye video,

13:50.189 --> 13:52.622
but we just wanted to give
the audience a quick warning.

13:52.691 --> 13:54.091
If you see something behind Coach,

13:54.159 --> 13:55.859
- it's definitely not a ghost.
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.928 --> 13:58.195
Yeah, actually, 90% sure it's not a ghost

13:58.263 --> 13:59.663
because there is no such thing.

13:59.732 --> 14:01.365
Uh, probably not.

14:01.433 --> 14:02.632
Definitely not...

14:02.701 --> 14:03.967
Because they're probably not real.

14:04.036 --> 14:05.469
Definitely. The only thing we know is,

14:05.537 --> 14:06.837
we don't know what we don't know.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.905
It's most likely nothing...

14:09.180 --> 14:11.214
Miles, my main man, how's it going?

14:11.282 --> 14:13.860
Hey, mate, I wish I could say tip -top...

14:14.306 --> 14:15.347
lollipop,

14:15.348 --> 14:18.133
but it's far from that. I'm screwed.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.692
<i>I'm still waiting for
all the details, but</i>

14:20.721 --> 14:22.270
<i>during the faculty sweep,</i>

14:22.309 --> 14:24.275
Stanford traced the IP address

14:24.344 --> 14:26.555
of my cyber sweetie Linda...

14:27.721 --> 14:28.998
to a high school.

14:28.998 --> 14:32.868
<i>Turns out, I've been speaking
to a 16-year-old online.</i>

14:33.486 --> 14:35.338
And I've gotta go on Oprah tomorrow

14:35.338 --> 14:36.830
and try and explain all of that.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.307
I'm done.

14:39.376 --> 14:41.943
Wow, yeah, no that's bad. That's bad.

14:42.012 --> 14:43.778
You know, what can I
say? You know, some people

14:43.847 --> 14:46.848
make bad decisions
purely of their own accord

14:46.916 --> 14:48.249
and, you know, they get punished.

14:48.318 --> 14:50.084
No, sorry, Jack, you don't understand.

14:50.153 --> 14:52.930
This is bad for you as well, I'm afraid.

14:53.757 --> 14:55.473
<i>I recommended you, so...</i>

14:55.893 --> 14:57.835
Stanford's revoking the offer.

14:58.895 --> 14:59.944
<i>I'm tainted,</i>

15:00.197 --> 15:01.627
and I've tainted you.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.732
I've tainted you bad.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.097
Stanford doesn't want you anymore.

15:10.141 --> 15:13.308
When you see the thing behind Coach,

15:13.610 --> 15:16.545
just know that you don't know what that is,

15:16.614 --> 15:18.313
and it's probably nothing.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.816
Because after all, if it was a ghost,

15:20.885 --> 15:23.719
okay, I'm sure we would
have seen a sign by now.

15:31.295 --> 15:33.996
Hell no!

15:35.599 --> 15:36.632
Everybody stay calm!

15:39.770 --> 15:40.736
Oh, God!

16:17.766 --> 16:20.500
No, we're still trying
to figure out who did it.

16:20.502 --> 16:22.001
No, I'm fine. It was just...

16:22.003 --> 16:23.197
It was really scary.

16:23.905 --> 16:25.971
Okay. Okay. Bye, Mom.

16:27.576 --> 16:29.194
Jack, have a seat.

16:30.616 --> 16:34.114
Uh, I am not a man who likes to beg,

16:34.116 --> 16:36.016
but I'm really good at it,

16:36.018 --> 16:38.385
and, uh, I am begging you.

16:38.387 --> 16:40.987
Please, please, stay at Whitlock.

16:40.989 --> 16:43.005
Okay, I can offer you the two

16:43.030 --> 16:45.091
parking spaces from earlier,

16:45.093 --> 16:47.556
a BOGO certificate to the school store,

16:47.863 --> 16:50.940
and... uh...

16:51.333 --> 16:53.601
a surge protector.

16:55.337 --> 16:56.405
Okay.

16:58.507 --> 16:59.958
I... sorry, that worked?

17:00.139 --> 17:01.842
Sure, Ralph. I'll stay.

17:01.844 --> 17:03.252
We're... yes!

17:03.712 --> 17:05.612
Oh, my God, this totally makes up

17:05.614 --> 17:09.415
for the literal bloodbath
that went down on my watch.

17:11.553 --> 17:12.551
Come on.

17:12.554 --> 17:13.990
Just one second.

17:33.243 --> 17:34.883
But we were rid of you.

17:36.485 --> 17:37.532
Nope.

17:38.298 --> 17:40.275
The dean of Stanford found out about

17:40.277 --> 17:41.924
our Miles-Catfish mission

17:41.925 --> 17:43.625
and it came back to bite me in the ass,

17:43.627 --> 17:45.501
so... it's over.

17:46.730 --> 17:47.929
I'm stuck here.

17:49.499 --> 17:51.833
Wow, it's almost Shakespearean.

17:51.835 --> 17:53.068
You ruined yourself.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.714
You know what might cheer you up?

18:01.078 --> 18:02.456
A little revenge.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.447
Maybe we could do a good
old fashion Miles mission?

18:05.449 --> 18:07.509
Oh, yeah, I don't know if you saw,

18:07.617 --> 18:09.846
but Miles' Oprah
interview went really well,

18:10.187 --> 18:12.394
and he's about to get his
own show on her network.

18:13.023 --> 18:14.195
Don't care.

18:16.141 --> 18:18.942
I'll just pop one of these Advil PMs

18:19.062 --> 18:20.105
and go to sleep.

18:20.931 --> 18:22.697
Let's see if we can make today...

18:23.531 --> 18:24.844
become tomorrow.

18:28.037 --> 18:29.703
You said, "There's no greater pick me up

18:29.705 --> 18:31.772
than taking down someone
who's wronged you,"

18:32.015 --> 18:34.343
but now you're just gonna
sit there and do nothing?

18:34.844 --> 18:35.759
Yep.

18:45.086 --> 18:48.455
All right, what is one
quality that Miles has

18:48.457 --> 18:50.490
that Mr. Griffin doesn't?

18:51.427 --> 18:52.860
He's British.

18:52.862 --> 18:56.138
Which means he can get deported.

18:56.163 --> 18:58.611
And what's the number one
reason people get deported?

18:58.934 --> 19:00.634
Exotic animal smuggling.

19:00.636 --> 19:03.470
All we have to do is get
illegal exotic animals,

19:03.472 --> 19:05.739
put them in his house, call the feds,

19:05.741 --> 19:07.975
and, boom, he's deported.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.880
- <i>_</i>
- <i>_</i>

19:14.391 --> 19:16.183
Where would you get the animals?

19:16.185 --> 19:19.191
Yo, my sketchy neighbor breeds snakes.

19:19.615 --> 19:22.022
Yeah, he's always trying
to sell his python eggs.

19:26.862 --> 19:27.892
Hmm.

19:28.431 --> 19:29.439
You know...

19:29.598 --> 19:32.066
guys, there could be something to this.

19:32.068 --> 19:33.267
Give me that.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.669
While we're on takedowns.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.015
I'm putting that Stanford dean on the list.

19:38.055 --> 19:39.383
Fricking hyena.

19:40.469 --> 19:42.485
Oh, if we're making a list,

19:42.487 --> 19:44.476
can we put my karate teacher on it?

19:44.856 --> 19:46.222
- What?
- He laughed

19:46.224 --> 19:48.235
when I fell doing my roundhouse kick.

19:48.993 --> 19:50.451
Guy does sound sucky.

19:50.451 --> 19:51.850
The dictator at CVS

19:51.852 --> 19:54.453
won't let me buy more than seven lighters.

19:54.795 --> 19:57.189
Sure, let's get him. He's toast.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.265
Oh, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,
this should go without saying,

20:00.267 --> 20:02.968
but, uh, we're back
to being a no-bio zone.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.915
Why don't you go ahead and
toss that puppy in here, Sarika.

20:06.184 --> 20:07.344
Let's go.

20:08.976 --> 20:11.597
Yep. There we go.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.491
Yeah.

20:22.491 --> 20:24.296
All right, now we're cooking.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.139
What else we got?

20:26.336 --> 20:28.962
My grandpa insists on cutting my hair.

20:28.964 --> 20:30.363
Oh, that's no good.

20:30.365 --> 20:32.899
My dentist is making me get braces,

20:32.901 --> 20:34.968
but I don't think I need them.

20:36.964 --> 20:39.331
Keep 'em coming. Who else?

20:39.333 --> 20:41.199
Coach Novak for making me do pushups.

20:41.201 --> 20:42.701
The lunch lady with the beard.

20:42.703 --> 20:44.736
Denzel Washington, but
also just to meet him.

20:44.738 --> 20:47.205
- Denzel.
- The kid in the cafeteria

20:47.207 --> 20:49.201
who keeps flicking my nipples.
