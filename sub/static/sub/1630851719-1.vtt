00:13.013 --> 00:16.558
[sultry music playing]

00:20.228 --> 00:23.565
[Gwyneth Paltrow] If you're watching this,
you probably have a pretty good idea

00:23.648 --> 00:25.358
what this series is about.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.902
-We're having sex, it's a show about sex…
-[all laughing]

00:27.986 --> 00:29.571
…we're gonna talk about sex.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.613
Hello.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.700
-[soaring music playing]
-[Gwyneth] I founded goop 13 years ago

00:33.783 --> 00:38.288
to unearth cutting-edge ideas that
could really help us optimize our lives.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.501
We thought it was about time that
we take this approach to sex and intimacy.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.421
Don't resist. Allow it to come through.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.132
You have total permission
to have an erection.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.467
Oh.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.512
We found some
extraordinarily brave volunteers…

00:54.596 --> 00:56.264
[woman]
My mom was a Jehovah's Witness.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.682
They love lesbians.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.851
-[all laugh]
-Yeah, they're huge fans.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.563
[Gwyneth] …willing to reveal
what we normally keep hidden.

01:03.646 --> 01:07.400
Each couple was matched
with a phenomenal practitioner.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.570
So, people come to me sometimes
because they want to learn how to squirt.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
-That's the whole clitoris.
-[man] Hmm.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.867
What is sexological bodywork?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.994
-Would you like me to go further?
-Yeah.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.498
I bet you didn't know you could have
energetic orgasms, did you?

01:21.581 --> 01:22.791
[woman 1] Would you do that?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.709
-Yeah. I think I might.
-Yeah.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.797
I enlisted my friend and intimacy expert,
Michaela Boehm.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.841
We've been in tantra positions
pretty close together.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.884
Oh, yes.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.261
Ah! I feel so much better.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.806
We're gonna have
to work on the sexy factor a bit.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.849
[woman 2] Right there's the sweet spot.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.602
[moans]

01:44.687 --> 01:46.815
-Man, that's kinky.
-[woman 3] This is great.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.900
[man howling softly]

01:48.983 --> 01:50.777
-[groans]
-[moans]

01:50.860 --> 01:53.279
Oh, my God. What just happened to me?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.740
It's probably gonna be
a little embarrassing and weird.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.200
Oh, man. No pressure.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.409
-Okay.
-[all laughing]

01:58.493 --> 02:01.454
Do you want me to put on
the Iron Man suit? Would that relax you?

02:01.538 --> 02:03.540
[all laughing]

02:05.416 --> 02:07.669
So, how are you all feeling about this?

02:07.752 --> 02:09.254
-Excited.
-[Gwyneth] Yeah?

02:09.337 --> 02:10.380
-Curious.
-Nervous.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.006
-A little nervous?
-[participants giggle]

02:12.090 --> 02:14.759
What's the… What's the nervous part?

02:14.843 --> 02:17.762
I think that we don't know
what's coming, necessarily.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.097
-We don't either.
-Yeah.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.014
[laughing]

02:20.098 --> 02:23.226
Yeah, I feel, like, down,
like, ready to do this.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.062
I feel… a little bit old.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.772
-Just…
-[all laughing]

02:28.439 --> 02:31.401
Like the grandmother I am. [laughs]

02:31.484 --> 02:32.694
I feel vulnerable too.

02:33.194 --> 02:39.742
You guys are showing an incredible amount
of bravery and courageousness because,

02:39.826 --> 02:43.830
you know,
this is a particularly vulnerable subject.

02:43.913 --> 02:47.584
It's not only, uh,
just an incredible bravery

02:47.667 --> 02:50.628
for you to show up with each other,

02:50.712 --> 02:53.798
we'll discuss things that
you might have never said to your partner,

02:53.882 --> 02:58.219
and that's really, really wild
when that happens in a relationship.

02:58.303 --> 03:03.641
It's really great that you guys did this,
and we're excited to be a part of this.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.185
Hi, I'm Damon.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.144
And I'm Erika.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.104
And we've been together
for about six years.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.022
Six years.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.608
The first time I saw her,
I think I fell in love with her.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.735
I'm an artist by trade.

03:13.818 --> 03:18.364
When I met her, I was drawing
caricatures out by the beach,

03:18.448 --> 03:22.827
and when I saw her, I literally said,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.413
"Yeah, she looks like
she could be my wife."

03:28.541 --> 03:30.126
[Damon] You know I love you.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.046
Will you marry me?

03:33.671 --> 03:35.548
[Erika] Yeah. I do.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.466
[Damon] You do?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.843
[Erika laughing] Are you crazy?

03:41.596 --> 03:46.059
If I'm completely honest, I think
the number-one thing we have is love,

03:46.142 --> 03:49.062
because communication
is not there a lot of times. [chuckles]

03:49.145 --> 03:53.024
Like, we get frustrated with each other
and, like, argue and fight.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.109
-We have the…
-[stabbing sounds]

03:55.193 --> 03:56.945
We have the dumbest fights.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.656
[interviewer] Do you fight about sex?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.200
We have.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.618
-Yeah. Definitely.
-Yeah.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.912
I'm more experienced than she is.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.289
Sexually, I feel she's very conservative.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.375
[Erika]
Sexually, we're very different people.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.419
That's been a frustrating thing.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.673
So is it fundamentally
a communication issue?

04:16.756 --> 04:20.802
Or it's like a mismatch in sexuality?
How would you characterize it?

04:20.885 --> 04:23.888
I think it's more of
a communication thing than sexuality.

04:23.972 --> 04:28.393
I feel, uh,
once we start having sex, you know…

04:28.476 --> 04:30.186
-It's okay. We're having sex!
-[all laughing]

04:30.270 --> 04:33.481
It's a show about sex.
We're gonna talk about sex.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.234
When I was a kid,
the worst part about going to school

04:36.317 --> 04:37.986
was getting up to go to school.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.863
Once I was at school, everything's good.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.075
-[woman] Great.
-[all laughing]

04:44.867 --> 04:46.744
See, I like to go to school, so…

04:46.828 --> 04:48.997
[all laughing]

04:49.080 --> 04:51.916
Which is like how we are, basically.

04:52.792 --> 04:59.048
We are very different when it comes to,
like, the way we want the other one to be.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.677
I like music and I like sensual,
and he's kind of like…

05:04.178 --> 05:05.013
[giggles]

05:05.096 --> 05:06.472
I like R&amp;B.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.766
-I like soul.
-No, I'm not talking about music.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.934
What? Look…

05:10.018 --> 05:14.689
He'll very much just be like,
"I'm horny. Like, aren't you?"

05:14.772 --> 05:17.525
And for me I'm like,
"Wait. I was just washing dishes." Like…

05:18.192 --> 05:22.572
[Damon] And for me,
I think as a guy, it's way easier.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.282
She turns me on.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.909
I mean,
it's as simple as that, she turns me on.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.580
When she walks around the house,
that's enough to turn me on. But…

05:32.123 --> 05:36.127
I need stimulation more than just, like,
penetration, basically is the point, like…

05:36.794 --> 05:40.256
I've had a penetration orgasm
twice in my entire life.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.469
[Damon] It's hard because
I want her to really enjoy it.

05:44.552 --> 05:49.182
I mean, who else would you want
to please more than anybody else?

05:49.265 --> 05:53.311
So one of the things
that's amazing in this here is

05:53.394 --> 05:55.229
the people you have access to

05:55.772 --> 05:57.482
and how they've been vetted

05:57.565 --> 06:00.943
and what they're about
and how cutting-edge they are.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.947
You're paired up
with a really, really good practitioner.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.159
I think it's gonna be
a really interesting journey.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.872
[upbeat vocalizing]

06:16.709 --> 06:21.547
My name is Jaiya, and I help
couples to have hot, juicy sex lives

06:21.631 --> 06:23.716
by learning more about their sexuality,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.219
and I'm the founder
of the Erotic Blueprints

06:26.302 --> 06:28.221
and the Erotic Blueprint Breakthrough.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.725
People are wired differently
when it comes to their eroticism.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.770
So Erotic Blueprints are
a language to help people understand

06:35.853 --> 06:38.856
more about who they are as erotic beings.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.902
I love that we are here
doing this on camera,

06:42.985 --> 06:44.904
and the reason why I love it is because

06:44.987 --> 06:50.868
I know that if one person viewing this,
it changes their erotic lives,

06:50.952 --> 06:51.786
it's worth it.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.871
[soft percussive music playing]

06:57.708 --> 06:58.876
I love this water.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.628
Oh, check out that statue.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.797
[Erika] Wow, that's beautiful.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.881
[Damon] Wow.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.220
[Jaiya] So, here we are.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.221
[Erika] Here we are.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.305
Here we are.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.101
We're here now to help the two of you,

07:15.184 --> 07:19.021
and so there's
orgasmic pleasure on the plate.

07:19.105 --> 07:23.109
One of the things I wanted to set up
as we talk about your pleasure and orgasm

07:23.192 --> 07:24.777
is that there's no pressure here.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.657
So there's no pressure for you to perform
or have an orgasm or any of that.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.161
The journey is
what I would like to focus on.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.456
So there's five
different Erotic Blueprints,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.999
and the first one is energetic.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.294
And an energetic is someone
who's turned on by anticipation.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.588
They like to have yearning, longing.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.756
So then there's the sensual,

07:45.840 --> 07:49.552
and a sensual is someone who's turned on
by all of their senses being ignited.

07:49.635 --> 07:55.099
That's the senses of smell, taste,
sight, touch, all of that being ignited.

07:55.183 --> 07:59.228
The sexual is someone who's turned on
by what we think of as sex in our culture.

07:59.312 --> 08:04.400
So, intercourse, orgasms, penetration,
genitals, nudity. Those kinds of things.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.112
The kinky is turned on
by whatever's taboo.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.449
So whatever is taboo
for you becomes the turn-on,

08:11.532 --> 08:14.744
and that could be psychological
or it can be more sensation-based.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.371
And then the shapeshifter.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.082
The shapeshifter is someone
who's turned on by all of it.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
So it's the whole smorgasbord.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.253
Nothing is ever too much.

08:25.046 --> 08:29.050
So the both of you have taken
the Erotic Blueprints quiz.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.969
The online quiz tells you what's happening

08:32.053 --> 08:34.680
pretty much from
a mental standpoint of each blueprint.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.266
-[Damon] Yeah.
-And I have your quiz results.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.811
So, what's really interesting
when I'm looking at couples' blueprints

08:40.895 --> 08:43.481
is oftentimes they're opposites.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.484
So they'll have, like, their highest one
is their partner's lowest one.

08:47.443 --> 08:51.155
So, what I thought was most interesting
was your lowest, so I'm gonna start there.

08:51.739 --> 08:55.076
So, in terms of sexual
was your lowest blueprint,

08:55.159 --> 08:57.787
and you were 12.9% sexual.

08:58.788 --> 09:03.417
Damon, your lowest was kinky, 5% kinky.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.418
[laughs]

09:04.502 --> 09:07.672
-But your highest, Damon, is sexual.
-All right.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.884
So when I talk about you speaking
different languages, this is what I mean.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.177
You speak sexual.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.888
With my own partner,
I'm highest in sexual,

09:15.972 --> 09:20.184
so my highest percentage
was sexual on my test as well.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.021
When I would initiate sex with my partner,
I would touch his genitals and be like…

09:24.105 --> 09:26.524
Like, in the car or randomly,
those kinds of things,

09:26.607 --> 09:29.110
and he'd look at me like,
"What are you doing?"

09:29.193 --> 09:31.237
-"I'm trying to drive."
-[Erika] Right.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.949
"I'm trying to do the dishes,
or I'm trying to do other things."

09:35.032 --> 09:38.035
"What is this?" And it feels like
it's coming out of left field.

09:38.119 --> 09:42.540
So, what's interesting, Erika, is
I thought for sure, just talking to you,

09:42.623 --> 09:44.458
that you would be highest in sensual.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.377
-Okay.
-That'd be your highest blueprint.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.671
But you're actually highest in energetic.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.589
Huh.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.300
What's fascinating is
that right under your energetic,

09:52.383 --> 09:53.884
almost the same percentage,

09:53.968 --> 09:54.969
is kinky.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.179
Okay. [giggles]

09:57.263 --> 10:00.433
So you have, like,
energetic and kinky at the top,

10:00.516 --> 10:02.643
and your kinky is the lowest.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.686
Oh, wow.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.105
[Damon chuckles] Energetic kinky.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.064
[women chuckle]

10:07.148 --> 10:09.609
And the picture
that puts in my mind is crazy.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.861
-[Erika giggles]
-What's the picture?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.155
I mean, somebody jumping
and running around, you know…

10:14.238 --> 10:15.906
-"Ah!"
-[laughing]

10:15.990 --> 10:18.284
You know, with the whips and leather, and,

10:18.367 --> 10:20.411
like, "You're not done!
You're not done!"

10:20.494 --> 10:22.413
[laughing]

10:22.496 --> 10:26.751
I think one of the really important things
here is that we'll redefine kink for you,

10:26.834 --> 10:30.630
for you both, like, what that means,
'cause it doesn't have to mean gags.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.591
And then the energetic piece
isn't about, like,

10:33.674 --> 10:36.093
"I have all this energy
and I'm running around."

10:36.177 --> 10:37.637
[laughs] It's about…

10:37.720 --> 10:40.139
It's about creating…
So, do this right now.

10:40.222 --> 10:44.310
So, if you took your arm and
you just put your hand over your arm,

10:44.393 --> 10:47.480
and then just feel.
Like, can you feel heat?

10:48.105 --> 10:52.652
Can you feel, like,
the hairs on your arm like that?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.196
-That… That's energetic.
-[Damon] Yeah.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.907
It's touching somebody
before you're touching them,

10:57.990 --> 10:58.824
Yeah.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.995
It's playing in the energy
of a person's body, not just the physical.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.665
Okay, so I'm gonna bring out some items…

11:05.748 --> 11:06.582
[Erika] Okay.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.418
…that we will be using for sensation play,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.295
or to play in the kinky realm.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.966
-We gotta get one of these for the house.
-[Jaiya] Okay. All right. Handcuffs.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.302
Have you been handcuffed before?

11:18.386 --> 11:19.220
No. [titters]

11:20.137 --> 11:22.014
That looks like a Pokémon tail, so…

11:22.098 --> 11:23.766
[laughing]

11:23.849 --> 11:25.726
-Pokémon tails can stay?
-Yeah.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.269
"Okay," is what I'm hearing.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.562
This is a wok cleaner,

11:28.646 --> 11:33.484
but the way that it's used is kind of
like this for a little bit of sensation.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.903
Okay, I wanna check in
'cause you mentioned chains.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.364
-[laughs]
-The way this is used is not as impact.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.116
Is that a metal flog?

11:40.199 --> 11:44.120
It's… It's to feel, like,
the way this drips and the temperature.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.872
-There's no impact with this item.
-Okay, cool.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.333
All right, and then, like, nipple, um…

11:49.875 --> 11:51.168
-Oh!
-…clamps?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.046
Is this something…
His nipples are sensitive.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.049
-My nipples are sensitive.
-[Jaiya] Not your nipples, your nipples.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.301
Although that could be interesting.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.803
[laughs]

12:00.886 --> 12:03.305
-I love hearing your blueprints talk.
-[Damon] You first then.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.350
These are, like, my Wolverine claws.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.768
[Damon] Whoo-hoo!

12:07.852 --> 12:10.020
-Oh, that's kinda hot.
-[Jaiya] It's hot.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.356
[women laughing]

12:12.440 --> 12:15.735
-I don't know why, but that is.
-What is it with women and knives, man?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.028
[Jaiya] I won't break the skin
or anything with them.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.323
It's mostly just for,
like, the interest of the sensation.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.161
[laughing]
This is crazy, man. This is so crazy.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.997
[Jaiya] You're nervous?

12:28.080 --> 12:28.956
Now I am.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.499
[Jaiya laughs]

12:30.583 --> 12:32.918
She can get excited
with that Wolverine claw.

12:33.002 --> 12:33.836
[Jaiya] Yeah.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.296
All right. Well,

12:35.379 --> 12:38.549
if you don't need anything else,
I think we're ready to get on the table.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.800
[stifled laugh]

12:40.384 --> 12:41.218
Okay.

12:42.052 --> 12:46.348
It's so interesting that the "problems"
that arise in a relationship

12:46.432 --> 12:50.186
are such amazing opportunities.
It's like the universe saying to you,

12:50.269 --> 12:54.565
"Hey, like, knock-knock, you know, you're
not perfect, you have some growing to do."

12:54.648 --> 12:58.152
"You have some learning
to do about yourself."

12:58.235 --> 13:00.237
I once had a therapist that said,

13:00.321 --> 13:03.282
"Your intimate relationship
is a meditation

13:03.365 --> 13:05.367
in everything that's wrong with you."

13:05.451 --> 13:06.494
[laughter]

13:06.577 --> 13:09.079
-I thought it was really…
-That's a very good one.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.166
I can really relate to what you said,
because in our relationship

13:12.249 --> 13:14.376
we've been working
with issues like boundaries

13:14.460 --> 13:16.962
and also different, just, personalities.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.048
I'm more avoidant. Rama's more anxious.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.675
-Should I start?
-Yes, you go ahead.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.344
Okay. My name is Felicitas.

13:24.011 --> 13:24.970
My name is Rama.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.515
I was born in Germany.

13:27.598 --> 13:32.019
So I was born in the Caribbean,
born, um, on the island of Antigua.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.189
My parents, they sent us
to the United States to go to school.

13:35.272 --> 13:40.528
[Felicitas] In 2006, I had just arrived
in upstate New York at Vassar College.

13:41.111 --> 13:46.492
And one of the first girls I met
invited me to her house party,

13:46.575 --> 13:48.077
and in walked Rama.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.120
And I remember saying, "Oh, who's that?"

13:50.204 --> 13:53.082
[Rama] We met in September,
we were married in May.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.210
So, we stayed. We have two children.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.379
We have a daughter,
she's turning 11 this year,

13:58.462 --> 14:00.923
and our son is turning six this summer.

14:01.006 --> 14:07.346
We never really had help from any,
you know, external family members.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.848
So, it was always just us,

14:08.931 --> 14:14.061
and we were buckling down a lot,
and really, our relationship suffered.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.354
And a couple years ago,

14:15.437 --> 14:18.065
it came to a screeching halt
where I decided I can no longer do this.

14:18.148 --> 14:18.983
[Erika] Aw.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.570
We were really close to getting a divorce.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.822
I was the one who initiated.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.660
I felt burnt out by family life,
my responsibilities.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.955
I felt like I'm having
to make most of the decisions.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.000
I didn't feel excited about sex anymore.

14:36.083 --> 14:40.212
It caught me by surprise
because I had blinders on.

14:41.005 --> 14:45.426
From the moment we wake up,
we are at the service to the kids.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.555
Making breakfast, preparing lunch boxes,
getting them dressed for school,

14:49.638 --> 14:51.390
getting them to school,

14:51.473 --> 14:53.976
and then, from there,
we pivot to work mode.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.061
[Felicitas] First things first.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.771
Coffee comes first.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.733
So there's just, uh,
not enough of an environment

15:01.317 --> 15:04.528
that can cultivate intimacy.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.615
From the woman's perspective,
it feels like the guy just wants sex.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.366
And I think from a lot of men,

15:09.450 --> 15:13.704
it is communicated in
a very needy way of, like, expectations.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.041
Like, "This is what I deserve
and this is what you need to give me."

15:17.124 --> 15:20.377
As a woman,
once you have a child to take care of,

15:20.461 --> 15:26.675
your capacity and willingness to take care
of someone else who's an adult diminishes.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.930
The husband does become
like the second or third or fourth child.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.515
For me, that's something I don't want.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.060
I'm giving so much of myself, of my body,

15:36.143 --> 15:39.188
I did not need
any more neediness from anybody.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.483
But we're gonna stick together.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.443
We're gonna figure out what it would take

15:44.526 --> 15:49.281
to make our relationship the center
of this next chapter in our lives.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.284
[soft percussive music playing]

16:03.420 --> 16:07.257
[Michaela] Pretty much everything we want
to do now is get the body ready, right?

16:07.341 --> 16:09.802
To the best of your ability,

16:09.885 --> 16:12.429
get into your worst kind of

16:12.513 --> 16:17.559
"Bad day at work,
kids are super annoying" mood.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.103
-Okay, mood. Okay.
-Mood.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.732
I'm gonna do the totally
overwhelmed Supermom. [laughs]

16:23.816 --> 16:24.817
-Okay, good.
-Yeah.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.945
[Michaela]
That's probably one that he knows. Right?

16:28.028 --> 16:29.655
-Get into that place.
-[Rama] You got it.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.700
-[Michaela] Okay, just look at his face.
-[Felicitas chuckles]

16:32.783 --> 16:36.537
-He's like, "Oh shit!"
-[both laugh]

16:36.620 --> 16:40.290
How I often start out
is what I call diagnostics.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.168
Right? And it's a bit like
you bring your car to the mechanic.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.630
Right? To find out what's working
and what's not working.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.756
So, what happened was,

16:47.840 --> 16:52.177
you went into your thing,
and his whole body had a reaction.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.930
He got that little boy,

16:55.014 --> 17:00.352
"Oh, shit, but I'm gonna do it
because that's what I do, but, oh, no!"

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
Right? You got all of that.

17:02.479 --> 17:06.233
A lot of my work
goes via the lens of embodiment

17:06.316 --> 17:09.778
because the body is
what we need for sex and relationship.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.323
Before we even
talk about sexual engagement,

17:13.407 --> 17:17.369
if his body isn't ready,
we can't even go to the sexual stuff.

17:17.453 --> 17:21.331
We have to get the body
available and online.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.418
It's very, very useful

17:24.501 --> 17:30.174
to actually see the couple in action
and see their bodies in action,

17:30.257 --> 17:34.636
because what they say is wrong
is hardly ever what is wrong.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.889
So, without talking,

17:37.723 --> 17:40.184
you are going to touch in ways

17:40.267 --> 17:42.352
'til you're actually relaxed, right?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.605
[Felicitas] Be, uh, inventive.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.648
Oh, you feel good.

17:50.110 --> 17:50.944
Good.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.866
[Michaela] There were a few
main strands of discovery, right,

17:55.949 --> 18:00.704
within what Felicitas
and Rama were bringing to me.

18:04.208 --> 18:08.170
Rama, he had very nervous,
anxious body patterns

18:08.253 --> 18:12.091
of kind of pulling away
from the ground, so to speak.

18:12.174 --> 18:16.303
So, meaning, not wanting to feel
certain things is the translation to that.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.972
[Felicitas] You don't need to follow.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.432
[Michaela] But don't say anything.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.684
This is part of
what we're trying to figure out.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.603
[Felicitas] Hmm.

18:24.686 --> 18:30.442
[Michaela] Felicitas had, um,
an observant aspect to her body

18:31.193 --> 18:33.320
where she was like,
"Huh, I don't know," right,

18:33.403 --> 18:36.907
and so that kind of critical aspect

18:36.990 --> 18:41.703
directly hooked into
Rama's criticized little boy dynamic.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.290
But when he then displayed
the criticized little boy,

18:45.374 --> 18:51.296
Felicitas would get quite disgusted
and, of course, more critical,

18:51.380 --> 18:54.383
but also withdrew attention and love.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.010
[Michaela] Good.
So, we'll stop there for a second.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.220
Yeah. [laughs]

18:58.303 --> 19:00.639
[Michaela] When trauma patterns of

19:00.722 --> 19:03.851
rejection, pain, when they enter the body,

19:03.934 --> 19:05.686
the body can freeze.

19:05.769 --> 19:10.023
And at that point, there is no
real connection possible anymore.

19:10.107 --> 19:14.278
And so I realized that I couldn't
actually go into the sexual domain

19:14.361 --> 19:17.531
until their bodies and
their nervous systems were open.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.033
So, what you're gonna do
is take your hands

19:20.117 --> 19:23.787
and move them down the front of his body,

19:23.871 --> 19:26.874
down his thighs, and go down with it…

19:26.957 --> 19:27.791
Okay.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.170
…and then push down
onto his feet and look up.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.516
Now you've gotta look up.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.643
-[laughs]
-[Felicitas] You love that.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.064
[chuckling]

19:51.148 --> 19:53.025
[Michaela]
Yeah, I think you got the basic idea.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.276
-Yes.
-How was that?

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
-That was great.
-[laughing]

19:57.279 --> 19:58.822
-It was fun.
-[Michaela] Okay, good.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.242
[vocal harmonizing]

20:15.214 --> 20:16.215
[Jaiya] All right.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.926
So, I'm gonna have you undress
as much as you're comfortable

20:19.009 --> 20:22.471
and lay on the table
face down on top of the sheet.

20:23.805 --> 20:24.723
Face down.

20:24.806 --> 20:28.018
[Jaiya] Now, a way to go
a little deeper from the body perspective

20:28.101 --> 20:29.519
is body mapping.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.105
And so this is…
There's a scale of one to five,

20:32.189 --> 20:35.067
five being highly pleasurable or orgasmic,

20:35.150 --> 20:37.694
and one being like,
"Don't like that at all."

20:37.778 --> 20:41.615
How pleasurable is this kind of touch?
Then we can do it within the blueprint.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.116
So, here's an energetic touch,

20:43.200 --> 20:46.286
or here's a sensual touch,
or here's a kinky touch,

20:46.370 --> 20:49.957
and I kind of combine
those things together into a flow

20:50.040 --> 20:52.167
to create, then, a pleasure map.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.129
-We're actually gonna start energetic.
-All right.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.882
So, we're gonna start up here.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.761
And, Erika, just take
a nice, big, deep breath.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.598
Okay, and we're just
gonna kind of pulse a little.

21:09.017 --> 21:09.935
Like, it got warmer.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.020
-Oh, I did feel that.
-You felt that?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.774
A little pocket where it got warmer.
So now you're feeling some energy.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.067
-Yeah.
-[Jaiya] Yay.

21:17.734 --> 21:21.113
Then what I'm gonna have you do, Damon,
is put your hands where mine are,

21:21.655 --> 21:24.574
and then just come in really slowly.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.536
Yeah, like, kind of what
you're doing there, like, feeling her,

21:27.619 --> 21:30.414
and then, eventually,
you're gonna rest your hands.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.292
I'll have you do once,
since she's sensitive there, one right…

21:33.375 --> 21:34.710
Yeah, did you see that?

21:34.793 --> 21:35.794
[laughs softly]

21:35.877 --> 21:37.004
I love that.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.839
[Jaiya] And you're gonna come up her.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.340
-Does that tickle?
-[Erika] Yeah.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.719
-[Jaiya laughs]
-[Erika] Oh!

21:43.802 --> 21:46.596
[Jaiya] So, in here is really good.
So, right behind the knee.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.597
Yeah.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.684
This is like genitals here.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.311
[Damon] Yeah.

21:52.936 --> 21:57.190
Had you heard of
the Sexual Blueprint theory before?

21:57.774 --> 22:00.569
I know Jaiya's work
and I really appreciate her work a lot.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.946
-It's pretty interesting.
-It's really interesting.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.616
And it makes a lot of sense
to give people something,

22:06.700 --> 22:09.911
a lens through which you can see yourself.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.246
Did you take the quiz?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.040
I'm energetic and I'm kinky.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.166
So I'm energetic as well,

22:14.249 --> 22:16.877
but it's a really
interesting way to approach it

22:16.960 --> 22:19.421
and to create more acceptance of self.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.339
-Yeah.
-Right?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.508
Particularly in an area
that's so fraught with

22:23.592 --> 22:27.262
odd feelings and shame
and things like that.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.975
[Jaiya] Okay, let's bring out
a couple little pleasure items.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.187
And then we're gonna see
what your pain scale is like

22:35.270 --> 22:36.855
with this particular implement.

22:36.938 --> 22:37.814
[Erika chuckles]

22:40.192 --> 22:42.527
-[Jaiya] So right now, where is it?
-Like four.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.946
Like a four? Okay, she's pretty sensitive.

22:45.030 --> 22:45.947
Mm-hmm.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.242
-Okay, does four feel like the sweet spot?
-No.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.328
[Jaiya]
No. You would like to go higher or lower?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.914
-Higher.
-Higher. Okay, so go a little harder.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.295
[Erika] Maybe a little higher.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.549
Yeah, that's nice. I like that.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.511
How pleasurable is that for you?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.055
It's a workout, like a Shake Weight.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.306
[laughs]

23:11.390 --> 23:12.849
How pleasurable is it?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.645
Uh, I…

23:17.187 --> 23:20.690
For me, pleasure-wise,
it just felt like I work here, you know?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.110
I mean, I'm just
giving her the pleasure. Yeah.

23:23.193 --> 23:27.072
So, right now, that's not crossing over
to, like, a lot of pleasure for you.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.242
Yeah. So, we'll keep playing with that.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.578
[Jaiya] For Damon,
his turn-on lies in her turn-on.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.998
So, while the implement
may not be doing it for him,

23:37.082 --> 23:40.001
her turn-on is the thing
that can do it for him.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.004
We can play with a little bit of kink.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.256
Our culture teaches us

23:44.339 --> 23:48.510
it's not okay to not know about sex
or to know exactly what to do.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.304
You can take anything furry, right?

23:51.388 --> 23:54.224
-And you can add something that vibrates.
-[Erika] Oh.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.225
[vibrating]

23:55.308 --> 23:56.810
[Erika chuckles] That's nice.

23:57.519 --> 24:01.898
[Jaiya] And so, it was so brave of Damon
to come in and be willing to learn,

24:02.607 --> 24:04.401
and to let that wall down.

24:04.484 --> 24:09.114
To go, "I love her
and I'm going to hear now."

24:10.323 --> 24:13.452
"I'm gonna open up
to hear now what she's been saying."

24:14.327 --> 24:16.413
That's pretty hot. [laughs]

24:16.997 --> 24:19.207
But part of that
is just giving him some comfort,

24:19.291 --> 24:21.293
that this is okay to play with.

24:21.376 --> 24:26.089
All right, we're gonna play with these,
'cause I know they were exciting.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.050
[laughs]

24:29.134 --> 24:32.262
[Jaiya] They're… You peeked. Okay, so…

24:34.181 --> 24:35.891
[Erika] You okay back there, Damon?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.478
[Jaiya] We're just gonna test…

24:42.689 --> 24:45.400
On a scale of one to five,
how pleasurable is that?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.237
-A four.
-[Jaiya] Four.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.575
Okay.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.913
And this is going to be B.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.789
So what you're gonna do is just drip this.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.293
And we're gonna drip it,
kind of like butt-cracky area, okay?

25:03.960 --> 25:08.882
So you're just gonna drip it down slowly…

25:08.965 --> 25:10.050
Man, that's kinky.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.552
[Jaiya laughs]

25:12.636 --> 25:14.554
[Damon and Erika chuckle]

25:14.638 --> 25:17.432
I actually kinda like that. [giggles]

25:17.516 --> 25:18.642
I bet you did.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.353
You should see it from here.

25:23.730 --> 25:28.652
Just gonna drip it
down slowly, slowly, slowly.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.407
When you think about
someone with a sexual struggle,

25:34.491 --> 25:37.661
my mind goes to chemistry

25:37.744 --> 25:40.163
or, you know,
are you well suited for each other?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.415
What most people don't understand is that

25:42.499 --> 25:45.877
relationship and sex
is actually a skill set.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.087
-Right.
-Right?

25:47.170 --> 25:51.550
And so, if you and I would go and
learn how to, I don't know, play golf?

25:51.633 --> 25:52.717
[laughs] You know?

25:53.510 --> 25:56.263
-Talk about sexy.
-Sexy. Yeah.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.767
So, we would have to have tools and then
we would have to learn proper form.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.270
Right. It's kind of such a simple solve.

26:03.353 --> 26:06.356
Yes. But then, so,
for instance, Felicitas and Rama,

26:06.439 --> 26:11.570
they had a very good relationship that
they had rebuilt from almost separation.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.488
-Right.
-But the spark was totally gone.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.489
Right.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.409
And so, there's a difference between

26:17.492 --> 26:21.454
what makes a relationship good
and what makes sex good.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.171
What we're going to do
is a fact-finding mission,

26:30.255 --> 26:35.260
because you do clearly have
great love and respect for each other,

26:36.052 --> 26:38.680
but we're gonna have
to work on the sexy factor a bit.

26:39.347 --> 26:42.434
[all laugh]

26:43.518 --> 26:45.145
I get it. That's why we're here.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.771
That's why we're here.

26:48.732 --> 26:54.988
Okay, what would you say
is his strongest contribution

26:55.071 --> 27:01.036
or strongest gift in your relational,
romantic sexual relationship?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.704
I think his commitment to me.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.997
[Michaela] Aw.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.168
Yes, that is his strongest contribution.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.087
What is her greatest gift to you?

27:11.755 --> 27:14.090
The things you like about her.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.175
Okay.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.053
So, what I like about you…

27:19.596 --> 27:21.765
is… is your…

27:23.308 --> 27:26.645
You have a very strong sense
of right and wrong.

27:29.564 --> 27:33.485
You are very, uh, committed to

27:34.235 --> 27:36.279
being in the right.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.281
Um…

27:39.074 --> 27:40.283
You…

27:40.367 --> 27:43.328
I appreciate, uh, how much energy

27:43.411 --> 27:50.085
you put into wellness
and sustaining our family,

27:50.168 --> 27:54.506
in terms of the decisions that
you make around diet and lifestyle.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.050
You look after our best interests.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.343
I appreciate that.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.974
I very much enjoy your partnership.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.397
And…

28:11.106 --> 28:13.441
Because it makes his life so much better.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.651
-Because--
-I'm joking.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.153
Oh yeah, it makes my life so much better.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.072
-That's true.
-[Felicitas laughs]

28:19.155 --> 28:24.786
Um, tell him a little bit about what it
felt like for him to say those things.

28:24.869 --> 28:25.745
[Felicitas] Mm-hmm.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.873
I didn't feel very seen
in a lot of those things,

28:28.957 --> 28:33.461
because I felt like they were,
like, my contributions to the family.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.048
I think I was hoping
for you to say something

28:37.132 --> 28:41.302
that wouldn't even necessarily,
like, affect you, do you understand that?

28:41.386 --> 28:44.347
Like, that would have been more about,
"Oh, this is, like, my essence,"

28:45.223 --> 28:47.058
or "I love how you love books."

28:48.518 --> 28:49.686
Uh, right? [laughs]

28:49.769 --> 28:52.105
-But… Okay.
-[Michaela] Yeah, yeah.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.440
Well, that's why…

28:53.523 --> 28:57.569
-There's nothing wrong or right here.
-Right. Yes.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.238
I think this is perfect for,

29:00.822 --> 29:07.495
um, kind of, unfolding the dynamic of
how we're gonna get you really connected.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.622
You have a very specific dynamic.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.668
You pat him on the back
and then you criticize him, right?

29:13.752 --> 29:17.046
And he has this little,
"I'm going to please you, Mommy" thing

29:17.130 --> 29:18.590
and then he has some resentment.

29:18.673 --> 29:23.470
So, that's your dynamic
that we want to break sexually.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.846
-Yes.
-Right.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.808
So I kind of want to upgrade
the operating system a bit.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.101
[all laughing]

29:30.185 --> 29:36.858
And the simplest way to do that
is to give those patterns a different name

29:36.941 --> 29:38.693
so you can access them easily.

29:38.777 --> 29:43.490
So that when you want to be
in that more romantic space,

29:43.573 --> 29:45.867
you can access
a different set of conversation.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.910
Yes. Mm-hmm.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.495
-So. Does that make sense?
-[Rama] Yes.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.038
-It does.
-Okay.

29:50.121 --> 29:53.208
So we're gonna give that woman a name.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.167
[Rama] Mm-hmm.

29:54.250 --> 29:57.921
So, what we're gonna call
the mean schedule, the general,

29:58.004 --> 30:00.298
just because then
we all know what that means.

30:00.381 --> 30:04.219
What's the part that you love
so much when it comes out?

30:04.302 --> 30:06.596
What is that part called?

30:08.223 --> 30:09.891
-Generally…
-Yeah?

30:09.974 --> 30:12.727
-…I refer to her as Feli.
-[Michaela] Yeah.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.313
-Feli. Felicitas is her full name.
-[Michaela] Yes.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.441
Okay. So we've got… I call her Feli.
That was the general name.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.901
-[Michaela] She likes that?
-Yeah.

30:19.984 --> 30:24.656
When I am feeling
very loving in that way,

30:24.739 --> 30:27.242
I call her Felicitas.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.702
So, if I was to give her
a non-general name,

30:29.786 --> 30:32.247
it might be Felicitas, in fact.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.873
-[Felicitas] Ooh.
-[Rama] Felicitas.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.333
-I like that.
-[Michaela] Like that?

30:35.416 --> 30:36.709
Yeah, I do like that.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.752
[Michaela] A-ha.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.420
Okay. See?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.674
And what do you call him
in his regular life?

30:43.508 --> 30:45.468
-Rama.
-Rama. Right.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.720
-So, Rama has a certain personality.
-[laughs]

30:47.804 --> 30:48.721
This is Rama.

30:48.805 --> 30:53.601
So, we're gonna give him a different name,
too, for the sexual occasion.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.647
My parents gave me the name
Ramayana as the middle name.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.315
They always referred to me as Rama.

30:59.399 --> 31:03.236
-Rama is a god.
-Of course. A god. Yes.

31:03.319 --> 31:06.322
-Yes, the Ramayana is the story.
-The… Is the story.

31:06.406 --> 31:10.869
So my name is not the story of Rama,
I am Rama.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.829
-[Michaela] Yes.
-The king warrior.

31:12.912 --> 31:16.040
What you're really saying is,
"I want to be the king…"

31:16.124 --> 31:17.041
[Felicitas] Yeah.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.169
-Mm-hmm. Right.
-"…of this particular kingdom."

31:20.253 --> 31:21.838
-Right.
-Right?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.131
-That's right.
-Yeah.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.091
Okay, look at her now.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.843
[Felicitas] I like that.

31:26.926 --> 31:27.969
[laughs]

31:29.679 --> 31:30.889
[Rama chuckles]

31:30.972 --> 31:32.223
[Michaela] Now we can start.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.100
[both laugh]

31:34.601 --> 31:37.854
[sultry music playing]

31:41.399 --> 31:42.942
[Jaiya] I have blindfolds here.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.153
Uh-oh. Halle Berry in Catwoman.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.988
-[all laugh]
-Right?

31:47.655 --> 31:50.116
[Jaiya] I'm gonna invite you
to play with this energetic touch,

31:50.199 --> 31:52.493
just, like, her inner thighs,

31:52.577 --> 31:55.288
you know, anywhere there's skin exposed.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.916
You can start to play
and dance on her body a little.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.919
I'm just gonna give you
a little, like, free space to just play.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.922
[sensual music playing]

32:07.133 --> 32:08.301
Uh-huh. That's good.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.309
That tickles.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.394
[Jaiya chuckles]

32:30.823 --> 32:31.699
Hey, baby.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.120
It's making me wanna touch him back.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.123
-Uh-huh, a good sign. Did you hear that?
-Mm-hmm.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.584
"It's making me want to touch him back."

32:41.668 --> 32:46.089
Erika and Damon felt like
they were mismatched sexually.

32:46.172 --> 32:50.510
Her blueprint quiz
turned out that she was kinky.

32:50.593 --> 32:54.430
-Mm-hmm. And he was low on kinky, right?
-He was very low on kinky.

32:54.514 --> 32:59.435
If people have fantasies or they're,
you know, they like certain kinks,

32:59.519 --> 33:02.647
where does the resistance
come from the partner?

33:02.730 --> 33:06.734
Are they threatened by it?
Do they think it's off-putting?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.904
-Sometimes it's just unfamiliar.
-Okay.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.324
Because a lot of people assume
that sexual compatibility means

33:13.408 --> 33:15.326
that you both like
exactly the same things.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.244
Right.

33:16.327 --> 33:21.124
There's a whole level of education
which I think is always worth mentioning.

33:21.207 --> 33:24.502
In general, kinky doesn't
necessarily mean whips and chains.

33:24.585 --> 33:28.506
-Right.
-It just means surprise, adventure.

33:28.589 --> 33:32.719
Maybe a little bit stronger touch,
but also being led,

33:32.802 --> 33:35.596
you know, where you kind of
can leave your head behind a bit.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.516
We're going to play
another little kinky game…

33:38.599 --> 33:39.434
Mm-hmm.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.269
…that I think you might like.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.188
So, this game is called Pretty Poses.

33:44.272 --> 33:49.402
And your job is to boss her around, okay?

33:50.111 --> 33:53.322
But it's like you're gonna pretend
like you're a photographer,

33:53.406 --> 33:56.284
and you're looking
for the most beautiful poses.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.328
-Got it.
-So your artist gets to come out again.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.246
Okay.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.541
I'm just gonna start it off,
and then you can kind of come in and play.

34:03.624 --> 34:04.459
[Damon] Okay.

34:04.542 --> 34:08.087
I want you to lower your left leg slowly.

34:08.171 --> 34:11.841
Yes. Yes.

34:11.924 --> 34:15.219
And then take your other knee
and start to raise it as far as you can.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.056
I'm going to give you
a little slack with that.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.974
Yes, right there.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.519
And now arch your back. Yes.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.980
Good. Beautiful.
Now, take one of your hands,

34:26.064 --> 34:29.108
and then just very slowly,
you can touch anywhere on your body

34:29.192 --> 34:31.235
that you want to touch
with one of your hands.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.488
Just very slow. Slow. Slow.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.781
Yes, beautiful.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.282
It's something out of a movie.

34:36.365 --> 34:37.784
-It is.
-Yeah.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.410
Slow. Slow.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.079
Feel your own body.

34:41.162 --> 34:43.498
-Yes. Beautiful.
-[Damon] Oh!

34:43.581 --> 34:45.041
[all laugh]

34:45.124 --> 34:46.876
[Damon] Don't stop what you're doing.

34:46.959 --> 34:50.671
Stretch your right hand
above your head as far as you can take it.

34:53.299 --> 34:57.011
Now start moving
your left hand down your left leg.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.391
And feel it.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.522
[Jaiya] Beautiful.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.817
I love the word "innovation."

35:11.692 --> 35:13.986
Couples who innovate last.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.366
The beautiful thing in the superpower
of the kinky is similar to an energetic.

35:18.449 --> 35:23.412
They could orgasm from something like
the psychology or the game of the play,

35:23.496 --> 35:25.373
as opposed to, like,

35:25.456 --> 35:29.210
having to have their genitals stimulated
the whole time like the sexual.

35:29.293 --> 35:33.214
So, there's all this spaciousness
to their creativity.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.925
And what I find beautiful
about the kinky is

35:36.008 --> 35:37.802
you can play in it
for the rest of your life

35:37.885 --> 35:41.597
and never have explored
all there is to explore.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.558
It is gorgeous. You are gorgeous.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.059
[Damon] Completely gorgeous.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.019
[Jaiya]
Okay, you have permission to speak.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.397
On a scale of one to five,
how pleasurable is this game?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.314
Five.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.732
-Five.
-[chuckles]

35:51.816 --> 35:53.651
So, was that fun for you?

35:53.734 --> 35:55.570
-Sure.
-This is also kinky.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.529
Yeah.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.740
I think it's just also
really helping me get out of my head.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.327
Like, it's really engaging and enjoyable

36:03.411 --> 36:07.999
and feels like we're participating
in something more than just…

36:09.667 --> 36:11.043
you know, intercourse.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.087
[Jaiya] Mm-hmm. Beautiful.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.631
I've been waiting for us
to try something like this,

36:15.715 --> 36:19.010
and this made me realize that,
like, for six years, we haven't been

36:19.677 --> 36:22.513
exploring our sexuality together.

36:22.597 --> 36:27.935
You know, coming from our past experiences
and expecting the other one to catch on.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.148
Her whole body is a wonderland
of pleasure and orgasmic pleasure.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.065
[Damon] Mmm.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.317
Not just her genitals.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.236
You can see that.
Her body, like, twitching or this or that.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.322
Like, it feels really good.

36:40.281 --> 36:45.369
I really learned that she's not
as sexually conservative as I thought.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.539
And that's exciting

36:49.874 --> 36:54.837
for me to a point, because
I'm not kinky, but this kink, I liked it.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.547
So, now I'm like…

36:57.798 --> 36:58.841
I'm just…

36:58.925 --> 37:00.009
[laughs]

37:00.092 --> 37:02.345
Forty-five years old,
learning something new.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.888
[laughs]

37:03.971 --> 37:07.350
Your blueprint is energetic,

37:07.433 --> 37:10.853
and I think you're more
like a psychological kinky

37:10.937 --> 37:15.566
than of the sensation or, like,
spanking or, like, those kinds of things.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.525
They add to it,

37:16.609 --> 37:20.696
but I think yours is more of the game
of "helping me get out of my head."

37:20.780 --> 37:24.242
And kink actually is
helping you get out of your head.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.328
So, those are the main things
for you to just ground in here,

37:27.411 --> 37:29.121
is, like, you're not broken.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.290
There's nothing broken.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.418
What's interesting is that
Damon has had this story

37:34.502 --> 37:36.671
about Erika not being as sexual,

37:37.505 --> 37:43.010
but I think that the more permission
and air he gives her to be sexual,

37:43.094 --> 37:46.555
she is gonna flower and blossom
into something that he's going to be like,

37:46.639 --> 37:50.643
"Whoa," and holding onto
the reins of where that's gonna go.

37:50.726 --> 37:54.563
'Cause it's going
to really blossom and fully flower

37:54.647 --> 37:57.566
and, you know, he's gonna have
a hard time matching it, I think.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.736
And now it's your turn. [laughs]

38:01.821 --> 38:02.655
Yeah.

38:02.738 --> 38:06.742
My blueprint says that I am very sexual,

38:06.826 --> 38:09.370
but it also says that I'm very not kinky.

38:10.955 --> 38:11.789
Yeah.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.958
[interviewer] Are you nervous
to get on the table next?

38:14.041 --> 38:16.085
Yeah, I'm nervous
to get on the table next.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.837
I don't know what's gonna happen.

38:20.631 --> 38:24.135
