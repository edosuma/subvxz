[girl] The forbidden kiss.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.196
We knew that it was wrong,

00:32.490 --> 00:34.784
that he was betrothed to my sister.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.955
But if this wasn't what he wanted,

00:40.415 --> 00:42.792
then why did he come
to the field of desire?

00:44.627 --> 00:45.670
It was fated,

00:46.880 --> 00:48.673
that we should meet like this.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.008
Hey!

00:50.675 --> 00:52.385
Are we hanging out or what?

00:54.345 --> 00:56.431
I just want to finish this chapter.

[dishes clattering]

01:00.393 --> 01:01.478
Oh!

01:04.272 --> 01:06.232
Should we go down and help him?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.444
He wants to do it himself,
but please come help me set the table.

01:10.236 --> 01:14.074
I hate when Dad makes Korean food,
it always tastes like butt.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.494
Regardless, whatever Dad puts
in front of you, take a bite

01:17.577 --> 01:19.621
and say, "Mm, just like Mom's," okay?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.998
I was still eating smushed peas
when Mom died.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.541
[knock at door]

01:23.625 --> 01:24.667
-Hey.
-Hey!

01:24.751 --> 01:26.169
I'm not too late, am I?

01:26.252 --> 01:29.631
I was trying to meditate,
but I ended up falling asleep.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.135
-Smells good, Dr. C.
-Hey, Josh.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.054
Lara Jean.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.641
So, uh... What you cooking?

01:42.644 --> 01:46.856
-If you just rock this back and forth...
-It's supposed to fall off the bone.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.193
Hey, Josh, come hang on to this
while I saw, would ya?

01:50.276 --> 01:54.239
Electric knife's in the kitchen,
it'll have that ready in two seconds.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.157
Looks great, Daddy. I'll be back.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.828
I can't believe we're not going
to see her until Thanksgiving.

01:59.911 --> 02:04.207
Christmas actually, Scotland's too far
to come back for Thanksgiving.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.127
Wait, are you kidding?
We're not gonna see her till Christmas!

02:07.210 --> 02:08.628
Look on the bright side,

02:08.711 --> 02:12.006
Margot won't be taking the car every day,
you can practice your driving.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.052
-I forgot I had to drive with Lara now.
-Feel free to take the bus.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.764
I can give you a ride.
I'm not disappearing, I'm next door.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.391
Or I can drive,

02:21.474 --> 02:24.394
and if we get pulled over,
we'll switch places real quick.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.063
-Top-notch idea, honey.
-What'd I miss?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.816
We were talking
about what a bad driver Lara Jean is.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.403
Yeah, we were, 
but we were also talking about airplanes,

02:33.486 --> 02:36.406
which speaking of...
I have a surprise for you.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.574
Oh...

02:38.408 --> 02:42.162
You couldn't come home for Thanksgiving,
I figured I'd bring home to you.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.748
It's a plane ticket,
I'm coming to Scotland.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.959
Look at Josh stepping up!

02:48.585 --> 02:50.545
You... You already paid for this?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.132
Yeah, I had a Google alert set for flights

02:54.215 --> 02:57.510
as soon as you decided
you wanted to go to school there.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.387
Why?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.854
Mm... Just like Mom's.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.358
[Lara Jean] I guess I should tell you
a little bit about Josh.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.070
He and Margot have been together
for the past two years,

03:16.154 --> 03:19.032
but before Margot even cared
that he existed,

03:19.407 --> 03:21.075
he was my first boyfriend.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.494
Well, space between the words...

03:24.162 --> 03:25.496
boy who was a friend.

03:26.956 --> 03:31.211
I could talk to him about anything.
We really understood one another.

03:31.294 --> 03:35.757
Okay, would you rather only drink water
for the rest of your life,

03:35.840 --> 03:39.844
or you can drink whatever you want,
but it has to have a drop of pee in it?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.221
Clear or yellow?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.098
It has to be a little yellow.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.436
I mean, pee. Definitely pee.
I can't give up Mountain Dew.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.105
Yeah, definitely. Pee's the only answer.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.275
We didn't stop being friends
when Josh and Margot got together,

03:54.359 --> 03:55.693
it was just different.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.403
Water. Definitely water.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.281
Yeah, me too.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.075
Definitely.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.746
They didn't want me to feel left out,
so they invited me everywhere...

04:07.413 --> 04:08.581
even on dates.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.294
They tried to make it
as normal as possible, but...

04:14.545 --> 04:16.464
I still felt like a third wheel.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.219
It's not that I wanted to steal
my sister's boyfriend or anything.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.473
I was super happy for Margot.
She deserves a great guy like Josh.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.850
And so I wrote him a letter.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.852
I wasn't going to send the letter,

04:29.936 --> 04:32.939
it was just for me
to understand how I was feeling.

04:33.231 --> 04:37.068
But really, I guess it was mainly
about how sometimes I imagined

04:37.151 --> 04:40.989
what it would've been like if I'd realized
how I felt about him sooner.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.199
[Margot] ...making me look
like the bad guy.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.953
-[Josh] You know how hard that was?
-You shouldn't have in front of them!

04:50.456 --> 04:53.334
My letters are my most secret possessions.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.794
There are five total:

04:54.877 --> 04:56.337
Kenny from camp;

04:56.421 --> 04:58.006
Peter from seventh grade;

04:58.089 --> 04:59.507
Lucas from Homecoming;

04:59.590 --> 05:01.634
John Ambrose from Model UN;

05:01.718 --> 05:02.719
and Josh.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.725
I write a letter when I have a crush
so intense I don't know what else to do.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.563
Rereading my letters reminds me
of how powerful my emotions can be,

05:13.646 --> 05:14.731
how all-consuming.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.902
And Margot would say I'm being dramatic,
but I think drama can be fun...

05:19.986 --> 05:21.779
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.449
Just as long
as nobody else knows about it.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.746
Your room's a mess.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.718
Are you okay?

05:44.510 --> 05:45.511
Yeah.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.180
Well...

05:48.014 --> 05:51.059
I don't know, I just broke up with Josh.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.477
You did what?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.520
Why?

05:56.647 --> 06:01.319
Before Mom died, she said I should never
go to college with a boyfriend.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.946
But you love him.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.032
I know.

06:08.743 --> 06:12.038
So, do you think
you might change your mind?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.505
No.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.507
No, never.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.344
When I was packing for college,

06:26.427 --> 06:29.389
I had Daddy make a box of things
to take to Goodwill.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.433
I think you should do it too,
I made you a box.

06:33.309 --> 06:37.730
I don't really think there's anything
I can part with at the moment.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.024
Lara Jean, I'm leaving tomorrow.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.027
That means
you're going to be the biggest sister.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.655
You need to set a good example
for Kitty,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.698
no gorging on chips before dinner

06:48.241 --> 06:49.283
and a clean room.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.496
Can we go back to talking
about how you're sad?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.776
[Lara Jean] Margot says
when something is no longer useful,

07:23.860 --> 07:26.904
you either donate it,
recycle it, or throw it away.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.158
I always knew she felt that way
about objects but...

07:32.452 --> 07:35.496
I didn't think she could feel that
about a person.

We'll be right back.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.030

you could think of?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.325
Who am I supposed to eat lunch with?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.536
I think you should look at this
as an opportunity to branch out,

08:15.620 --> 08:16.996
-make new friends.
-No.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.791
-You never know what could happen.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

I can promise you I will never, ever...

08:32.512 --> 08:33.513

08:33.596 --> 08:36.641
We couldn't decide,
so we got you all of them.

08:38.309 --> 08:42.980

but if you stick with it... Come here.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.661

No, that's not Margot.

We're still cool, right?

14:22.820 --> 14:23.946
We can still talk and...

14:25.781 --> 14:27.199
you know, kick it?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.619
Ugh... Don't say "kick it."

14:33.038 --> 14:34.123
Yes, we are cool.

14:35.958 --> 14:36.959
Good.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.253
Good.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.089
Do you want a carrot?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.259
Give me a carrot.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.306
I know what you're thinking,

14:50.389 --> 14:52.600
but we really were cool.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.060
However I felt about Josh...

14:55.144 --> 14:56.353
New album.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.439
...I would never do that to Margot.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.068
The middle school cafeteria
is so ginormous.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.405
Alison wanted to sit at lunch,
but so did Brianna and Katy.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.575
I ended up rotating so everyone had time
next to me, you know?

15:09.658 --> 15:11.869
Yeah, I can totally relate.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.712
Really?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.255
Course.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.553
[boy] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:32.181 --> 15:34.433
Good thing I'm wearing my helmet!

15:42.775 --> 15:43.943
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.402
-How you doing?
-Good.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.570
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.366
You know people usually check behind them
before they reverse

15:50.449 --> 15:53.077
to avoid killing others,
it's a thing we do.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.957
Yeah, I'm just not completely comfortable
with using my mirrors yet, so...

15:58.040 --> 15:59.041
Yeah, clearly.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.503
Think you're gonna be able
to make it out of the parking lot?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.964
Yeah. We're fine.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.924
Really, seriously.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.968
Um, so you should just...

16:09.635 --> 16:10.636
go, seriously.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.223
Sure, whatever you say, Covey.
Hey, you're in charge.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
Who was that?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.066
That was Peter Kavinsky.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.738
-What are we waiting for?
-The rest of the cars to leave.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.240
Oh, my gosh.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.827
Blanche, you simply have to help me.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.497
-What do you think Margot's doing tonight?
-Crack.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.958
Kitty, why would you say that?

16:41.041 --> 16:44.712
It's how Scottish people say fun.
Like, "You're a good craic."

16:45.087 --> 16:46.088
I looked it up.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.757
It's weird not having her here, huh?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.552
It's weird not having Josh here, too.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.013
I miss his Blanche impression.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.222
How many boyfriends

16:55.305 --> 16:58.308
could a naive farmer's daughter
possibly have had?

16:59.518 --> 17:00.519
Fifty-six.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.816
Excuse me?

17:07.401 --> 17:08.402
You know,

17:08.777 --> 17:14.241
Lara Jean, if you had a boyfriend,
maybe you wouldn't have to drive at all

17:14.324 --> 17:15.993
'cause he would take us places.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.620
If that's what it takes,
I think you're stuck with me.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.790
I dunno. What about the guy
you almost killed the other day?

17:22.750 --> 17:23.876
He's dating Gen.

17:23.959 --> 17:24.960
So?

17:27.212 --> 17:28.797
It's not just that...

17:33.260 --> 17:39.767
Don't you find it kinda depressing
that it's Saturday night,

17:39.850 --> 17:43.771
and you're having a Golden Girls marathon
with your little sister?

17:43.854 --> 17:47.483
No. I love the Golden Girls,
and I love hanging out with you.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.027
Okay,

17:50.444 --> 17:53.989
I'm not telling you this
to make you feel bad,

17:54.823 --> 17:56.909
but, Lara Jean,

17:57.576 --> 18:01.830
I'm 11 and I canceled plans

18:02.331 --> 18:03.624
to be here tonight.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.502
And well, you're 16,

18:07.211 --> 18:10.297
and I don't think
you had anything else going on,

18:10.881 --> 18:11.882
am I right?

18:13.634 --> 18:15.427
That is way harsh, Kitty.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.971
The truth hurts, Lara Jean.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.842
What'd you do last night?

18:54.925 --> 18:57.177
I finished another book. It was so good.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.054
Another bodice ripper, you little perv.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.682
-I enjoy them for their camp.
-Yeah, right!

19:01.765 --> 19:05.227
-Don't worry, girl, no judgment.
-Hey! Can I talk to you?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.104
-Um, me?
-Yeah.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.733
Hey, PK, I heard my cousin dumped you
for a college student, that true?

19:12.151 --> 19:16.321
-I heard you have a tail.
-Yep, really cute. Like a little piggy.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.032
I need to talk to...
I need to talk to Lara Jean.

19:19.950 --> 19:20.951
Alone.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.497
If you need me,

19:25.581 --> 19:27.624
I'll be in the nurse's office,

19:28.375 --> 19:29.918
with a migraine,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.129
Googling Justin Trudeau shirtless.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.090
Look, I wanted to say that I really...

19:35.716 --> 19:38.385
I appreciate it,
but it's never gonna happen.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.179
I'm sorry, what?

19:40.762 --> 19:45.851
From what I remember that kiss was hot,
you know, for being in seventh grade,

19:45.934 --> 19:51.481
and I think it's really cool you think
I have golden specks in my eyes.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.695
[echoing] It's just, Gen and I are in
a really weird place right now.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.407
[distorted] I don't know
what you hoped to accomplish. Whoa!

20:03.493 --> 20:04.494
Hey, Lara Jean.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.122
Lara Jean!

20:07.706 --> 20:08.957
Lara Jean, wake up.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.045
Hello? Hey, can I get some help over here?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.464
Hey. Hey...

20:15.923 --> 20:16.924
Wake up!

20:18.383 --> 20:19.468
Are you okay?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.512
-What happened?
-You fainted.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.182
Oh... Okay.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.478
Here, give me your hand.
And the other one, too.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
Come on, you got this.
Here we go. And you're up.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.108
Want me to call someone,
get you some water?

20:36.151 --> 20:37.653
No, I'm okay.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.363
You sure?

20:46.286 --> 20:47.371
Oh, my God.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.501
Oh, my God!

20:53.001 --> 20:54.294
Oh... Okay. Wha...

20:56.797 --> 20:57.798
Hey!

20:58.715 --> 20:59.716
Stop that!

20:59.925 --> 21:01.635
Two more laps for you, Covey!

21:03.345 --> 21:04.972
-Thank you.
-Wait... Wha...

21:05.597 --> 21:06.598
Uh, I...

21:09.476 --> 21:10.477
Lara Jean!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.201
[boy] Hey, Lara Jean, you in there?

21:28.036 --> 21:29.037
No.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.751
["Human Right" by The Strike plays]

21:36.044 --> 21:37.212
Hi, Lucas.

21:37.921 --> 21:38.964
Hey, Lara Jean.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.763
That ascot looks really cool on you.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.307
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.684
It's actually a cravat.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.147
I really like your braid crown.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.190
Oh, cool. Cool.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.817
My sister did it for me.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.028
I...  It's dope.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.408
Do you maybe wanna dance?

22:08.618 --> 22:11.663
Oh, my God. I never thought you'd ask!

22:30.098 --> 22:32.267
Look, I didn't mean to barge in on you.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.937
I saw you run in here and I wanted
to make sure you're OK, and, uh...

22:36.938 --> 22:39.983
thought you might want that back.
It seemed a little personal.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.694
Lucas, I wrote this years ago.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.571
Freshman homecoming, right?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.660
I had a lot of fun that night, too.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.833
But I feel like I should tell you, though,
you know I'm gay, right?

22:56.917 --> 22:57.959
I did not.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.506
Yes. Of course, yes. I... I did. I did.

23:03.090 --> 23:07.052
But don't like tell anyone, though.
I'm out and I'm not ashamed.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.553
You know, my mom knows.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.139
My dad kinda knows.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.350
It's just...

23:14.434 --> 23:16.561
-High school.
-High school. Yeah.

23:27.697 --> 23:28.865
Hey, sweetheart.

23:28.949 --> 23:29.950
Hi, Dad.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.076
All good?

23:33.662 --> 23:38.083
Have you seen a green box? It has fabric
on top, it's round, there's a bow on it.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.670
Wow. No "hi, Dad,"
no "why are you home early?"

23:41.753 --> 23:45.048
Maybe because your patient delivered
in under six hours,

23:45.132 --> 23:48.301
you brought a new life into the world,
and you're home to...

23:48.385 --> 23:52.472
I really need to know.
Mom gave it to me. It's very important.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.851
I don't know. Maybe it went out
with the Goodwill boxes.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.187
The Goodwill boxes?

24:03.817 --> 24:05.527
No, no.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.446
Hey, you got some mail.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.579
This is all your fault!

24:16.746 --> 24:17.956
I hate everyone!

24:20.333 --> 24:21.460
What's her problem?

24:21.835 --> 24:22.919
Moon day?

24:23.211 --> 24:24.337
Moon day?

24:24.588 --> 24:27.799
Menstruation is science,
nothing to do with the moon.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.260
Says you, doctor man!

24:30.385 --> 24:32.846
But the Goddess within says
it's a sacred rhythm

24:32.929 --> 24:35.557
that represents the deepest celebration
of womanhood.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.645
The letters are out. They're out.
There's nothing you can do about it.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.107
Silver lining,
Kenny's letter was addressed to camp,

24:44.191 --> 24:48.528
so at least he'll never find out how hard
you were crushing after Chubby Bunny.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.071
You really oughta relax.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.574
I know you love me.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.868
Loved, past tense.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.244
You're Margot's.

24:56.786 --> 24:59.164
Dear Josh, I lie awake at night

24:59.247 --> 25:01.708
and imagine running my fingers
through your hair.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.586
-Feeling your strong arms aro--
-Shut up!

25:05.754 --> 25:06.796
You're not real.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.717
-I'm more real to you than he is.
-[doorbell rings]

25:11.259 --> 25:12.594
What are you doing?

25:14.804 --> 25:15.805
Nothing.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.309
Lara Jean, Josh is here.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.019
You never saw me!

25:29.361 --> 25:30.362
Ow!

25:30.820 --> 25:33.281
Ow, ow, ow. Ow!

26:01.518 --> 26:02.602
Hey, Covey.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.484
Oh... Anything for your friend?

26:09.568 --> 26:10.569
He's not with me.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.737
I'd like a chocolate shake. Thanks.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.822
-Sure.
-Yeah.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.034
So what you doing here?

26:18.118 --> 26:21.496
I'm just here to take down
one of those chocolate shakes.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.497
Cool.

26:22.998 --> 26:27.544
Actually, I stopped at your house,
your sister said you'd probably be here.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.380
Look, I just wanna be super clear.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.965
-Okay.
-Okay?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.467
I'm flattered, I am, but...

26:35.385 --> 26:37.554
Gen and I, like, just broke up so...

26:37.637 --> 26:39.306
Are you trying to reject me?

26:39.389 --> 26:42.767
Yeah, it didn't really seem like it took
the first time.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.312
Peter Kavinsky,
I'm not trying to date you.

26:45.395 --> 26:49.858
Your mouth is saying something,
but your mouth said something different.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.276
What?

26:53.028 --> 26:55.238
Thank you, uh... Joan.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.997
Okay, um... So here's the thing,
I don't actually like you.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.499
I just had to make it look
like I liked you

27:06.583 --> 27:08.918
so someone else wouldn't think
I liked them.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.504
Oh, okay. Okay, who?

27:11.588 --> 27:12.631
-What?
-Who?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.216
You gotta tell me
who this mystery stud is,

27:15.300 --> 27:19.596
otherwise I'm gonna go on believing
you have a secret tattoo with my face on.

27:19.679 --> 27:20.680
No.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.683
Should I tell the school
that you wrote me a love letter?

27:23.767 --> 27:25.477
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. Um...

27:26.186 --> 27:27.437
It's Josh Sanderson.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.316
Wait, hold on, Sanderson?
Doesn't that guy date your sister?

27:31.441 --> 27:32.275
Yeah...

27:33.026 --> 27:37.072
Well, he dated my sister,
in the past tense.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.742
He also got a letter, so you can see
how awkward and complicated

27:40.825 --> 27:43.953
-that's gonna get if he thinks I like him.
-Hold on. Stop.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.289
I'm not the only guy that got a letter?

27:47.207 --> 27:51.294
Wow, you really think you're special,
then you find out she wrote two guys.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.172
I wrote five,
so don't go feeling too special.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.466
-You wrote five love letters?
-Yeah.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.426
Damn, Covey, you're a player.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.720
Who else did you write letters to?

28:00.804 --> 28:03.598
-If I tell you will you leave me alone?
-Maybe.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.725
Okay, Lucas James.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.976
He's... He's gay.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.812
-You don't know that.
-Everyone knows.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.815
-Who else?
-Um...

28:11.898 --> 28:16.111
Someone from camp and someone
I went to Model UN with in fifth grade.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.030
So, are we good here?

28:19.114 --> 28:21.533
Um... Yeah. No, yeah, we're good.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.493
Okay, great.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.577
Wait, wait, wait.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.662
It's just...

28:26.037 --> 28:29.040
That sparkly bike out front,
is that your ride?

28:30.458 --> 28:31.459
Yeah.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.384
Thanks for driving me.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.552
Yeah, sure.

28:41.219 --> 28:45.306
-Sorry for the whole jumping you thing.
-Coulda been worse, right?

28:47.308 --> 28:49.519
What are you gonna say to Sanderson?

28:50.019 --> 28:53.857
-I guess the truth.
-Yeah, but, you know...

28:53.940 --> 28:56.943
What is the truth? 
Do you like him, do you not like him?

28:57.777 --> 28:59.946
It's not your problem, Peter.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.959
Hey, hold on.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.672
What if you didn't tell him?

29:18.840 --> 29:19.716
What?

29:19.799 --> 29:23.428
What if we let people think
we were actually together?

29:23.511 --> 29:24.929
Just for a little while.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.057
And not just Sanderson. I mean everybody.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.185
Why would you want that?

29:30.268 --> 29:33.354
For starters, when Gen heard 
you kissed me, she went nuts,

29:33.438 --> 29:37.484
and if she thinks you and I are a thing,
she'll want to get back together.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.028
Oh, so you wanna use me as your pawn?

29:40.111 --> 29:45.408
Ah, well, see... Technically, you used me
as your pawn first when you jumped me.

29:48.912 --> 29:52.499
You don't have to give me an answer now,
just think about it, okay?

29:52.582 --> 29:54.626
Yep. Don't hold your breath.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.472
Yo, Sanderson, yeah?

30:08.264 --> 30:09.682
Taking Lara Jean home?

30:10.517 --> 30:11.518
Looks like it.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.276
Hey, how long you two been hanging out?

30:21.236 --> 30:22.237
Uh...

30:23.112 --> 30:24.113
Not long.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.087
[phone beeps]

30:42.257 --> 30:44.050
-[Josh] Will you call me?
-[Lara Jean] Stop.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.303
There's so much I wanna talk about,
music I wanna share,

30:47.387 --> 30:49.180
tattoos I wanna get with you.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.099
Stop. Josh, this cannot happen.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.725
We'd be so great together.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.519
Oh, my God. Shut it.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.567
It's a cool trick, right?

31:01.609 --> 31:03.319
You wanna see me do it again?

31:06.823 --> 31:07.949
Oh, my God.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.001
Hey, Kavinsky!

31:25.008 --> 31:25.842
What?

31:26.426 --> 31:27.510
Let's do this.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.858
I'm going to trig.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.528
-Have a nice day.
-Yeah.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.696
Carry on.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.448
As you were.

31:48.531 --> 31:51.826
So, first things first,
we need to have a contract

31:51.910 --> 31:54.412
so we're on the same page
about the rules.

31:54.746 --> 31:59.375
You got rules? Come on, you really know
how to zap the fun out of a situation.

31:59.459 --> 32:03.129
It's important to know
where you stand on certain issues.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.213
Okay, like what?

32:05.006 --> 32:07.342
For example,
I don't want you to kiss me anymore.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.012
You crazy? Who's gonna believe
we're in a relationship

32:11.095 --> 32:12.513
if I'm not allowed to kiss you?

32:12.597 --> 32:15.183
You may be the James Dean
of this kind of stuff

32:15.266 --> 32:17.101
but I've never had a boyfriend.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.647
You have the references
of an 80-year-old woman.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.024
What does that matter?

32:23.107 --> 32:26.319
It matters because 
I don't want all my firsts to be fake.

32:26.402 --> 32:30.073
If I'm making out with someone,
I'm gonna do it for real.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.741
But you kissed me first.

32:34.452 --> 32:35.870
This is non-negotiable.

32:37.872 --> 32:38.873
Fine.

32:41.334 --> 32:45.588
We need to figure something out
because people are gonna get suspicious

32:45.672 --> 32:47.715
if I'm not allowed to touch you.

32:47.799 --> 32:53.096
Okay, you have a point. How about this?
You can put your hand in my back pocket.

32:53.179 --> 32:56.599
Hand in your back pocket?
What the hell is that?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.059
Sixteen Candles?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.478
It's the opening image.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.939
It's a couples thing.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.358
Yeah, maybe in the '70s.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.443
Sixteen Candles was the '80s.
John Hughes?

33:08.528 --> 33:09.529
-Nothing?
-Mm.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.863
Okay...

33:11.114 --> 33:12.115
Two more rules.

33:12.198 --> 33:15.451
You have to watch Sixteen Candles with me
because it's a classic,

33:15.535 --> 33:19.539
and we can never tell anyone
this relationship is fake,

33:19.622 --> 33:22.166
because it would be too humiliating
for both of us.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.377
Duh, first rule of Fight Club.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.294
What?

33:25.378 --> 33:28.548
Are you serious?
You've never seen Fight Club?

33:29.215 --> 33:32.218
Oh, my God!
Okay, write it down. Double feature.

33:32.301 --> 33:36.222
After we watch the Candles movie,
we are watching Fight Club.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.432
Fight Club...

33:38.141 --> 33:39.851
Sixteen Candles...

33:40.727 --> 33:41.894
No snitching.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.856
Anything else?

33:49.444 --> 33:50.737
I could...

33:51.362 --> 33:52.822
I could write you notes,

33:53.865 --> 33:54.949
every day.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.244
You'd do that?

33:58.327 --> 33:59.328
Sure.

34:01.205 --> 34:04.876
Gen was always on me
to write her them. I never did,

34:04.959 --> 34:07.003
so if I start sending them to you,

34:07.503 --> 34:09.464
she'll be pissed, it'll be good.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.800
How romantic.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.846
Also, you have to come with me
to my lacrosse games and parties.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.974
You have to pick up my sister and I
and drive us to school.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.059
Okay.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.438
But you're coming on the ski trip.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.401
Whoa...
The Adler High ski trip was infamous

34:30.485 --> 34:34.280
for being the location where
more students lost their virginity

34:34.363 --> 34:36.491
than Senior Week and Prom combined.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.409
I have never been.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.286
Obviously.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.370
Um...

34:42.038 --> 34:46.167
That's three months away. Do you think
we're still gonna be doing this?

34:46.793 --> 34:48.836
Let's call it a contingency.

34:49.420 --> 34:53.299
No one in their right mind is gonna let
their boyfriend go without them,

34:53.382 --> 34:56.928
so if we are still doing this
by the time it comes around,

34:58.137 --> 34:59.263
you have to go with me.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.351
I'm certain that by the time
the ski trip comes around,

35:03.434 --> 35:08.022
Peter and I will be ancient history,
and that is the only reason I say...

35:08.106 --> 35:09.774
Okay. Deal.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.251
Come on, Kitty. We're gonna be late.

35:28.334 --> 35:32.088
I hate taking the bus.
Can you please man up and start driving?

35:32.171 --> 35:33.297
Actually...

35:33.381 --> 35:34.465
[car horn honks]

35:38.970 --> 35:41.055
Hey. Y'all ready?

35:41.597 --> 35:43.141
Oh, hell, yes!

35:48.104 --> 35:49.856
Hey, little LJ, what is that?

35:50.231 --> 35:51.816
A Korean yogurt smoothie.

35:51.899 --> 35:55.194
And my name, thanks for asking,
is Katherine Song Covey.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.364
Kitty to my friends.
You can call me Katherine.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.700
Yes, ma'am. She's feisty!

36:01.534 --> 36:03.244
Kitty, put on your seat belt.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.165
So how exactly
do you know my sister again?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.251
I guess I'm her boyfriend.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.171
Can I have some of that?

36:13.880 --> 36:14.881
Sure.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.721
Oh, wow. That is really good.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.764
Hey, what do I have to do

36:23.848 --> 36:26.309
to get you to bring me
one of these tomorrow?

36:26.392 --> 36:27.810
You're driving us again?

36:27.894 --> 36:28.936
Yeah, of course.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.730
Okay, you can call me Kitty!

36:32.481 --> 36:33.399
Progress!

36:43.534 --> 36:48.206
I was used to being invisible,
but now, people were looking at me,

36:48.831 --> 36:50.041
talking about me.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.216
What are you doing?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.300
This is for you.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.016
Good job.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.228
I'll see you in a bit, okay?

37:14.523 --> 37:16.567
It's weird and somewhat off-putting

37:16.651 --> 37:19.862
to be congratulated on doing nothing more
than accepting a note

37:19.946 --> 37:23.157
and having an ass pocket 
for someone to stick their hand into,

37:23.241 --> 37:25.618
but I guess
that's where my life has taken me.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.415
The Kavinsky thing is insane!

37:31.499 --> 37:35.503
Who knew you had a secret boner
for the king of the cafeteria crowd?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.464
I know, I'm just as shocked as you are.

37:38.547 --> 37:39.548
Did Margot freak?

37:40.132 --> 37:42.969
Actually, you know,
I've been avoiding her calls

37:43.052 --> 37:45.554
so she doesn't know yet.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.475
Hi, Margot. How's college?

37:49.934 --> 37:52.895
So listen, did I mention
I have a fake boyfriend?

37:54.230 --> 37:56.607
No? Yeah, it's Peter Kavinsky.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.234
How did it start?

37:58.317 --> 38:03.489
See, that's a funny story,
because it definitely was not because

38:03.572 --> 38:08.077
I was trying to convince your ex-boyfriend
that I wasn't in love with him,

38:08.160 --> 38:09.287
that's for sure.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.122
Oh, shit...

38:12.331 --> 38:14.625
[Skype ringtone beeps]

38:15.251 --> 38:16.168
Hi!

38:16.252 --> 38:21.340
Hi, finally. I feel like we haven't talked
in forever, so tell me everything.

38:21.632 --> 38:22.675
Well...

38:23.050 --> 38:26.846
I'm just making cupcakes tonight
for Kitty's bake sale.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.850
Cupcakes? No.
It's so much easier to do brownies.

38:30.933 --> 38:34.186
Well, I bought all the ingredients
for cupcakes,

38:34.270 --> 38:36.105
and you're not really here, so...

38:36.355 --> 38:39.358
Okay, fine, do cupcakes.
I'm sure they'll be great.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.321
So have you seen Josh at all lately?

38:43.696 --> 38:46.073
What? No. Why would I be seeing Josh?

38:46.532 --> 38:50.953
I don't know, 'cause he's our neighbor?
Is everything okay with you?

38:51.537 --> 38:54.248
No, you know... No, you know, sorry.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.043
I am just so excited
to get to these cupcakes.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.921
I think I'm gonna go and do that,
but it was so good to see you.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.381
-Wait, Lara Jean!
-Bye!

39:09.347 --> 39:10.598
[knock at door]

39:16.312 --> 39:17.313
Hey.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.816
Who are you supposed to be,
the Pillsbury Doughboy?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.652
No, I'm making cupcakes
for Kitty's bake sale.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.780
Can I come in?

39:26.822 --> 39:27.823
-Sure.
-Cool.

39:28.324 --> 39:33.412
You know it's easier if you make something
you can cut into squares like brownies?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.706
My mom used to do it for my brother.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.211
Peter Kavinsky, what are you doing here?

39:40.628 --> 39:43.798
Did you not read my note?
I'm taking you to Greg's party.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.675
-Oh, I'm not going to that.
-Yeah, you are.

39:46.759 --> 39:50.304
One, Gen is gonna be there,
and two, parties are in the contract.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.264
Sorry, Peter, I can't.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.349
A deal's a deal.

39:53.432 --> 39:57.103
You can't what? Is that Peter Kavinsky?

39:58.145 --> 40:00.731
Little Peter Kavinsky,
you're as tall as me now.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.818
-Good to see you again, Dr. Covey.
-You can call me Dan.

40:03.943 --> 40:07.154
I'm here to pick up Lara Jean,
take her to a friend's party.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.449
The parents will be home,
and I will have her home early.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.826
Is it alright if we go?

40:11.909 --> 40:12.910
-Yes.
-No!

40:14.245 --> 40:16.288
I can't go.
I have to finish these cupcakes.

40:16.372 --> 40:19.166
I think Kitty
and I can handle some cupcakes.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.294
Why don't you go have fun
with your friend Peter Kavinsky?

Get dressed, get changed,
you look like a crazy lady.

No drinking. No drugs.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.431
-No hands.
-You got it.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.604
I don't know, Peter. I...

40:40.688 --> 40:43.315
No, we're going. It's in the contract.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.619
-What are you doing? Give me this.
-No.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.913
What? No. Give that back.

-Come on. You know I already got it.

42:04.772 --> 42:05.940
Nice talk.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.071
So... Dish.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.907
What's up with you and Kavinsky?

42:15.074 --> 42:17.451
Oh, no. Don't push her. She's shy!

42:17.535 --> 42:18.661
[girl chuckles]

42:18.744 --> 42:22.456
-What do you wanna know?
-Everything. When? How?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.500
How far? H on B?

42:24.583 --> 42:26.168
H on C?

42:27.336 --> 42:29.713
H up and down on P? T on C?

42:29.838 --> 42:32.174
Sorry, what are we talking about again?

42:32.258 --> 42:35.844
You know, forget it.
Clearly they haven't done anything.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.054
How would you know?

42:37.638 --> 42:39.098
Because I know Peter,

42:40.516 --> 42:41.934
and I know Lara Jean.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.312
I'm gonna get a refill.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.816
Um... can I get you anything?

42:49.149 --> 42:51.318
Like a juice box or chocolate milk.

42:51.402 --> 42:55.906
Peter's going to get me a drink,
but thank you so much for offering.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.866
Ooh. What's up, babe?

42:57.950 --> 42:59.034
Hi.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.917
Why is beer so vinegary?

43:07.001 --> 43:08.043
Oh... It's not.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.838
Kombucha is, though.
I'm driving, remember?

43:11.547 --> 43:12.798
You drink kombucha?

43:14.091 --> 43:15.884
Yeah, it's good for your digestion.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.098
Here. Take a selfie.

43:23.434 --> 43:24.727
Alright. You do it.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.651
Hey. Boo!

43:33.319 --> 43:34.320
Hey.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.447
Hey. I didn't know you came.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.157
Well, here I am.

43:38.741 --> 43:42.202
So you're with Kavinsky, huh?
Guess those letters worked.

43:42.286 --> 43:46.790
-Yeah, but you gotta keep it a secret.
-Your filthy secret's safe with me.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.375
What's that?

43:49.501 --> 43:51.211
Whoa. Hey, occupied.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.426
Lara Jean Covey, really?

43:59.345 --> 44:00.346
What do you care?

44:03.849 --> 44:07.686
Aw, this is so cute! Is this hers?

44:07.770 --> 44:08.854
Come on.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.444
How do I look?

44:17.029 --> 44:19.448
You look good, Gen. You always look good.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.575
Come on, give it back.

44:22.117 --> 44:24.578
No, I'm going to keep it for a while, 'k?

44:25.412 --> 44:27.706
Don't worry, I won't tell.

44:28.707 --> 44:29.708
Go on, try it.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.169
Not gonna lie to you, that sounds nasty.

44:33.796 --> 44:34.797
Bottoms up.

44:35.839 --> 44:39.259
Hey. Do you want to get out of here,
go grab some food?

44:40.886 --> 44:42.930
-Oh no, go ahead. Go, go.
-Okay.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.348
-See you later.
-Bye.

44:45.599 --> 44:46.600
See ya.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.813
You did so good tonight, Gen was pissed.

44:50.896 --> 44:54.441
Yeah, I just hope she doesn't
put glass in my smoothie on Monday.

44:55.984 --> 44:59.530
-I love how you're not afraid of her.
-No, no. I'm terrified of her.

44:59.655 --> 45:02.032
But you don't let her steamroll over you.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.077
Like that day she was being a bitch
about your shoes.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.705
-You remember that?
-Yeah, of course.

45:08.414 --> 45:13.252
I mean, I couldn't say anything
because we were together and everything

45:13.335 --> 45:17.256
but those shoes weren't just cool,
I thought they were kinda hot.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.343
Gen's gorgeous,
but you have way better style.

45:22.720 --> 45:23.721
Thank you.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.764
You need anything else?

45:25.848 --> 45:27.725
Um, no. I think we're good.

45:27.808 --> 45:28.726
Okay.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.810
[phone buzzes]

45:36.024 --> 45:39.903
-She makes me so angry sometimes.
-We're still talking about her?

45:40.028 --> 45:44.742
Tonight, she barely talks to me, we leave,
and I have a thousand texts from her.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.453
-Okay, have you been responding?
-No, I'm...

45:47.619 --> 45:52.124
-I'll just call her when I get home.
-You guys still talk on the phone then?

45:52.708 --> 45:55.961
I mean, not as much as we used to,
but yeah, sometimes.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.132
-What?
-Hmm?

46:00.215 --> 46:01.633
You do this thing,

46:01.717 --> 46:04.970
you have this whole judgy face scenario
going on.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.930
I guess I just think it's really weird

46:07.014 --> 46:09.349
you still talk to your ex-girlfriend
on the phone.

46:09.725 --> 46:10.934
It's not healthy.

46:11.018 --> 46:14.480
Sorry, you're the expert?
You've never even had a boyfriend.

46:14.563 --> 46:18.525
You've only had one girlfriend,
and you're obsessed with her.

46:18.650 --> 46:21.445
That doesn't necessarily
make you The Bachelor.

46:21.528 --> 46:22.613
One, I am not...

46:23.197 --> 46:24.281
obsessed with her.

46:24.364 --> 46:30.078
Okay. So then, prove it.
Don't call her tonight.

46:30.162 --> 46:33.791
For some who's quiet all the time,
you have a lot of opinions.

46:33.874 --> 46:37.252
That's just because no one's been
honest with you before.

46:39.046 --> 46:39.922
Okay, fine.

46:41.215 --> 46:45.344
Be honest with me, then.
Why haven't you ever had a boyfriend?

46:47.137 --> 46:50.182
I don't know.
I guess no one's ever liked me like that.

46:50.265 --> 46:52.392
Lies. I know that those are lies,

46:52.476 --> 46:56.730
because I know for a fact Carlos Myers 
asked you to Spring Formal last year

46:56.814 --> 46:57.815
and you said no.

46:57.898 --> 47:01.276
-Are you keeping tabs on me?
-Come on, Covey, talk to me.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.737
What happened to no secrets? Fight Club.

47:04.321 --> 47:05.155
Remember?

47:07.574 --> 47:10.369
Okay. Um... So love and dating?

47:11.453 --> 47:14.498
I love to read about it,

47:14.581 --> 47:17.626
and it's fun to write about

47:17.709 --> 47:20.003
and to think about in my head, but...

47:22.047 --> 47:23.215
when it's real...

47:25.884 --> 47:27.261
What, it's scary?

47:29.137 --> 47:30.138
Yeah.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.976
Why? Why is that scary?

47:37.020 --> 47:39.898
'Cause the more people
that you let into your life,

47:39.982 --> 47:42.442
the more that can just walk right out.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.824
Just like... Like your mom, right?

47:55.330 --> 47:57.207
Uh, did you know that...

47:58.917 --> 48:00.419
my dad left us?

48:00.502 --> 48:02.671
Yeah. That was a while ago, right?

48:04.715 --> 48:05.799
Two summers ago.

48:07.134 --> 48:10.512
He's got a new wife and kid now.

48:11.638 --> 48:12.681
I'm so sorry.

48:12.764 --> 48:15.934
No, it's fine. It's...
I don't usually talk about it.

48:16.018 --> 48:19.771
I just felt like maybe you'd understand
'cause of your mom.

48:19.855 --> 48:22.524
Not that
it is anywhere near the same thing.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.819
No, it's totally fine.
I completely understand.

48:27.946 --> 48:30.324
Yeah, it's... It's hard, huh?

48:32.242 --> 48:33.243
It's whatever.

48:34.328 --> 48:37.748
We don't have to talk about it,
but it's not whatever.

48:40.417 --> 48:45.047
I think it's funny,
you say you're scared of commitment

48:45.130 --> 48:46.465
and relationships,

48:47.382 --> 48:50.886
but you don't seem to be afraid
to be with me.

48:52.512 --> 48:55.265
-Well, there's there's no reason to be.
-Yeah?

48:56.808 --> 48:57.809
Why's that?

48:59.937 --> 49:01.480
'Cause we're just pretending.

49:03.982 --> 49:07.319
Right, of course, Lara Jean Covey,

49:07.402 --> 49:11.531
ladies and gentlemen, you can count on her
to be honest, always.

49:12.532 --> 49:13.533
Wait, Peter?

49:13.825 --> 49:16.286
-Are we cool?
-Yeah, we're fine, Covey.

49:16.745 --> 49:19.665
Thank you for coming to the party tonight.

50:10.382 --> 50:11.550
[phone beeps]

50:19.516 --> 50:22.436
Fake dating Peter was getting easier
and easier.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.855
I always ate with him in the cafeteria

50:24.938 --> 50:27.691
and was even becoming friends
with some of his friends.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.152
Don't touch my fries.

50:30.235 --> 50:33.363
Listen, Lara Jean, 
I was thinking about your name,

50:33.447 --> 50:36.575
Lara Jean, put them together,
you get Largie! Largie.

50:36.658 --> 50:38.910
They were nothing like my old friends.

50:38.994 --> 50:41.913
-Are you on something?
-I'm on to a new nickname for you.

50:41.997 --> 50:46.626
Largie, it's funny because she's so small!

50:46.710 --> 50:49.296
But it was fun to be part of a group.

50:49.379 --> 50:52.883
Of course, there were still moments
I wanted to disappear.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.427
[doorbell rings]

50:56.887 --> 50:57.846
Hey.

50:57.929 --> 50:59.097
Can we talk now?

51:00.348 --> 51:02.434
I can't believe you're dating Kavinsky.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.019
Why?

51:04.728 --> 51:07.564
Is it so unbelievable
that someone could like me?

51:07.647 --> 51:10.525
No, it's unbelievable that...

51:11.026 --> 51:15.363
you're like the sweet, innocent girl,
and he's a complete dick.

51:15.614 --> 51:16.615
I don't get it.

51:16.698 --> 51:21.328
You know you make me sound really boring,
right, Josh? I'm not that innocent.

51:22.287 --> 51:23.288
Okay.

51:24.539 --> 51:25.540
Okay!

51:26.541 --> 51:30.462
Well, great. If that was the reason
you came over to talk to me...

51:30.545 --> 51:32.422
No, it's... I... Wait.

51:33.757 --> 51:34.633
Look...

51:38.512 --> 51:40.889
Did you mean what you wrote in the letter?

51:42.641 --> 51:45.811
I don't know. Okay?
It was a long time ago.

51:45.894 --> 51:47.646
Well, not for me, alright?

51:47.729 --> 51:52.109
This is all new, so like, I'm...
I'm trying to understand here.

51:52.192 --> 51:55.862
There's nothing to understand.
You should have never seen it.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.197
I did see it!

51:57.823 --> 52:00.659
Alright? So... What am I supposed to do?

52:01.409 --> 52:04.121
-Not tell Margot?
-Margot's not even talking to me.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.915
Alright?
You don't have to worry about that.

52:10.752 --> 52:12.629
I'm sorry. Thanks, I...

52:13.839 --> 52:14.840
That's it?

52:15.090 --> 52:18.927
Margot dumps me, you're dating Kavinsky,
and we can't even be friends?

52:19.010 --> 52:21.429
I don't know
how to be friends with you like this.

52:21.513 --> 52:24.516
We can't go back to how it was
before you and Margot were dating.

52:24.599 --> 52:28.103
We definitely can't go back to how it was
when you were dating.

52:28.186 --> 52:32.149
-If I'd known I was gonna lose both of--
-Stop. Don't finish that sentence.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.276
I just...

52:37.112 --> 52:40.282
-You can't just ignore me.
-No, we can't talk. Sorry.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.545
Go away!

52:54.713 --> 52:58.383
I'm sorry, isn't this character,
Long Dong Duck....

52:58.884 --> 53:00.093
like, kinda racist?

53:00.177 --> 53:02.137
Not "kind of." Extremely racist.

53:02.679 --> 53:04.389
So why do you like this movie?

53:04.639 --> 53:09.394
Why are even asking that question?
Hello, Jake Ryan!

53:11.938 --> 53:14.065
I am way better looking than that guy.

53:14.316 --> 53:15.442
You wish!

53:15.525 --> 53:18.028
Oh, yeah? Incoming!

53:20.280 --> 53:21.448
Whoa. Okay.

53:21.531 --> 53:24.492
I just hoped
that Kitty wasn't getting too attached.

53:24.701 --> 53:25.702
In fact,

53:26.494 --> 53:29.539
I wish we could've kept our families
out of it altogether.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.209
We're so happy to finally meet you.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.879
Peter tells me that you have two sisters.

53:35.962 --> 53:41.259
Yes, I have an older sister who just left
for college, and I have a younger sister,

53:41.343 --> 53:42.344
who's Owen's age.

53:42.427 --> 53:45.222
Aw. Well, your mom must love having girls.

53:45.805 --> 53:48.308
And me? I'm stuck with these two heathens.

53:48.683 --> 53:49.684
Mom, I told you.

53:49.768 --> 53:52.103
Lara Jean's mother passed away
when she was little.

53:55.023 --> 53:57.609
I am so sorry, Lara Jean, I...

53:59.319 --> 54:01.821
Actually, she-- she did love having girls.

54:02.989 --> 54:05.450
Although,
Kitty is definitely still a heathen.

54:10.872 --> 54:13.250
So, Owen's a pretty shy kid, huh?

54:13.500 --> 54:14.501
Yeah.

54:15.126 --> 54:17.295
I think Kitty could help with that.

54:17.504 --> 54:18.588
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

54:19.005 --> 54:19.839
Okay.

54:19.923 --> 54:22.217
I think they would be good friends.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.928
Probably. Yeah.

54:27.514 --> 54:30.934
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what my mom said to you.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.894
No, it's okay.

54:33.728 --> 54:38.149
Honestly, you know, it's nice
talking about her like it's normal.

54:39.025 --> 54:41.778
Like it's not some tragedy.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.913
Is it weird not having your dad around?

54:55.333 --> 54:57.544
It's not as weird as it used to be.

54:59.713 --> 55:04.342
Sometimes I walk around the house
and see he's not in any photos anymore,

55:06.344 --> 55:07.721
and I really miss him.

55:09.931 --> 55:12.934
But then I think about everything
he's doing with his new family

55:13.018 --> 55:16.813
that he used to do with us,
and I get so mad I'm glad he's gone.

55:17.272 --> 55:18.565
You don't mean that.

55:20.442 --> 55:23.028
You can be mad at someone
and still miss them.

55:28.033 --> 55:30.243
I bet you really miss your mom, huh?

55:32.829 --> 55:33.830
Yeah.

55:34.247 --> 55:35.248
Every day.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.585
But you know, it's...

55:39.919 --> 55:42.255
It's been so long now that, like...

55:42.339 --> 55:45.050
Okay, it's like this,
I'll be doing my homework,

55:45.133 --> 55:48.720
or I will be washing dishes or something,

55:48.803 --> 55:51.181
and I'm thinking about my family,

55:51.639 --> 55:56.102
and I forget there was a time where
it wasn't just my dad and my sisters.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.982
And it only happens
for like a quarter of a second, but...

56:01.816 --> 56:04.110
I feel really, really guilty about it.

56:07.155 --> 56:09.282
I've never told anyone that before.

56:10.617 --> 56:11.659
I mean, I get it.

56:12.494 --> 56:13.745
It makes sense to me.

56:15.413 --> 56:18.375
I don't actually hate my dad,
I didn't mean it like that.

56:20.001 --> 56:21.544
At least he's not, you know...

56:24.005 --> 56:25.006
Dead.

56:26.925 --> 56:27.926
Sorry.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.637
It's okay.

56:33.515 --> 56:37.352
It's actually really nice having someone
to talk to about this stuff.

56:38.561 --> 56:39.938
You're a good listener.

56:40.522 --> 56:41.523
Yeah?

56:42.440 --> 56:43.441
Why, thank you.

56:45.443 --> 56:46.486
You are, too.

56:48.154 --> 56:49.155
Thanks.

56:49.948 --> 56:50.949
You're welcome.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.035
Being with Peter was so easy

56:54.119 --> 56:56.871
that sometimes 
I let myself pretend it wasn't fake.

56:57.288 --> 57:00.917
Remind me again why we have
to eat these subs under the bleachers?

57:01.000 --> 57:04.629
Dude, we can't have
these contraband cups out in the open!

57:04.712 --> 57:08.967
Don't want the powers-that-be catching on
to my lunchtime truancy vibes.

57:09.050 --> 57:11.261
P.S. that sub is tight, right?

57:11.344 --> 57:15.306
I don't know, Peter. It's like
you don't have time for me anymore.

57:15.890 --> 57:17.809
All you do is hang out with her.

57:17.892 --> 57:21.521
Am I supposed to wait
while you're off with this college guy?

57:21.604 --> 57:25.942
-We should get out, this sounds private.
-Are you insane? That's your boyfriend!

57:26.025 --> 57:27.819
He's not a good listener.

57:27.902 --> 57:30.572
'Cause he's not at your beck and call
like I am.

57:30.655 --> 57:32.740
Gen, you can't keep doing this to me.

57:33.950 --> 57:37.745
She's not coming on the ski trip, is she?
That's our thing.

57:37.912 --> 57:40.415
What does it matter? You have a boyfriend.

57:41.749 --> 57:42.959
Yeah, but...

57:43.835 --> 57:44.961
maybe by then...

57:45.628 --> 57:46.629
I won't.

57:47.839 --> 57:48.840
Dude!

57:50.133 --> 57:51.926
Gen is after your man.

57:54.345 --> 57:58.016
I'm sorry, I know you don't want
to hear about Peter stuff,

57:58.099 --> 58:01.186
but I needed to talk to someone
I thought might understand.

58:01.269 --> 58:03.480
I feel like the more used to him I get,

58:03.563 --> 58:06.649
the more it's gonna hurt when
he inevitably gets back with Gen,

58:06.733 --> 58:10.737
and I'm so mad at myself
because I should've seen this coming.

58:12.405 --> 58:13.490
Nah, I'm good.

58:15.783 --> 58:19.078
I don't know what to tell you.
That sucks. I'm sorry.

58:19.829 --> 58:20.955
Lara Jean!

58:23.249 --> 58:24.250
Want me to wait?

58:24.918 --> 58:25.960
You'd better not.

58:31.090 --> 58:32.300
I'll see you later.

58:32.383 --> 58:34.344
What do you think people are gonna say

58:34.427 --> 58:36.930
when they see my girlfriend
cozying up to Sanderson?

58:37.013 --> 58:42.101
What do you think, when they hear
you're begging to get back with Gen?

58:42.185 --> 58:45.230
-So you're spying on me now?
-Not intentionally.

58:46.314 --> 58:49.275
Okay, so I was talking to Gen. So what?

58:49.359 --> 58:51.861
You don't even post about us
on your Instagram.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.988
'Cause I don't want my sisters to see.

58:54.322 --> 58:56.157
Yeah, like Kitty's gonna care.

58:56.241 --> 58:58.034
I'm talking about Margot.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.496
Look, Peter...

59:02.622 --> 59:06.501
I don't think either one of us thought
this was going to go on for this long,

59:06.584 --> 59:11.297
but Josh and I are cool, Gen's jealous,
I think that we need to call it.

59:11.381 --> 59:14.926
I can't believe you're trying to break up
with me before the ski trip.

59:15.009 --> 59:16.469
That's in the contract.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.847
-Only if we're still together.
-We are still together!

59:19.931 --> 59:22.559
You're trying to pull out
because you're scared.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.602
What do I have to be scared about?

59:25.937 --> 59:27.313
You tell me, Covey.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.985
How do you tell your fake boyfriend
you can't go skiing with him

59:32.068 --> 59:34.320
because you're starting
to have real feelings?

59:34.779 --> 59:35.780
You can't.

59:36.531 --> 59:37.615
So you pivot.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.451
I'll go if Chris goes.

59:40.868 --> 59:44.706
I'm not denying your right
to put food on the table for your family.

59:44.789 --> 59:49.168
I just think it's odd that a man would
want to become a gynecologist.

59:49.335 --> 59:51.838
Like when you were in college,
you thought,

59:51.921 --> 59:56.092
"I'd really love
to look at vaginas all day."

59:57.552 --> 59:59.679
Gonna leave the kitchen now, Christine.

1:00:01.347 --> 1:00:03.099
-Hi, guys. Hey.
-Hi, honey.

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:04.392
Hi, Dad.

1:00:05.101 --> 1:00:06.102
So, what's up?

1:00:06.185 --> 1:00:09.397
Why's your boyfriend harassing me
about coming on the ski trip?

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:11.733
You know I don't do school functions.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:15.862
Yes, and that is why I told him
I would only go if you would,

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:17.614
knowing that you wouldn't.

1:00:18.865 --> 1:00:19.866
Wait...

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:21.826
You have to go!

1:00:22.327 --> 1:00:25.538
Gen's definitely gonna
make a move on Peter if you stay home.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:26.623
So let her.

1:00:26.706 --> 1:00:30.376
I'm sick of having her little snake eyes
on me all the time.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:31.669
Dude, no!

1:00:31.753 --> 1:00:34.881
Gen always gets what she wants
and it's bullshit!

1:00:35.715 --> 1:00:36.924
You get Peter.

1:00:37.550 --> 1:00:40.678
I'll make sure of it.
I'm coming on that trip.

1:00:40.762 --> 1:00:43.973
I'm really tired of you using me
to get back at Gen.

1:00:44.057 --> 1:00:45.391
It's not just that.

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:49.354
Since you've been with Peter,

1:00:49.437 --> 1:00:50.897
well, I don't know, LJ,

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:53.650
I've never seen you so happy.

1:00:53.941 --> 1:00:55.193
Honey, she's right.

1:00:55.818 --> 1:00:58.029
I'm sorry, I wasn't eavesdropping,

1:00:58.112 --> 1:01:03.785
but I haven't seen you have so much fun
going to parties and making new friends.

1:01:05.244 --> 1:01:07.288
You made your old man very happy.

1:01:12.168 --> 1:01:13.544
That was kind of sweet.

1:01:14.087 --> 1:01:15.088
Yeah.

1:01:19.425 --> 1:01:21.844
Thanks, Dad. See you in a couple of days.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:24.055
We need to talk about your sexual health.

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:26.182
No. No, please, no.

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:29.227
As your father,
I think you're too young to have sex.

1:01:29.310 --> 1:01:31.771
Did you know
most unwanted teenage pregnancies

1:01:31.854 --> 1:01:34.065
are the result of expecting abstinence?

1:01:34.148 --> 1:01:36.984
I know that you're smart enough
not to do things

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:39.153
just because a boy may want you to.

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:40.905
Okay, let's make this end.

1:01:41.072 --> 1:01:43.241
It's your decision. I want you to be safe.

1:01:44.617 --> 1:01:46.285
Why are you giving me these?

1:01:46.369 --> 1:01:47.829
Pulling out's not protection.

1:01:47.912 --> 1:01:49.414
Oh, my God. I'm getting out.

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:54.919
Don't forget to have fun.

1:01:55.002 --> 1:01:58.840
Yes, well, I have a lot of rubbers
for that, specifically.

1:02:08.141 --> 1:02:10.059
Whoa. Hey. Where are you going?

1:02:10.685 --> 1:02:12.520
I'm gonna go sit with Chris.

1:02:12.645 --> 1:02:14.814
Chris? Come on, she's sleeping.

1:02:15.022 --> 1:02:16.482
I saw her Snapchat.

1:02:16.566 --> 1:02:19.402
She was up all night
at this EDM concert thing.

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:22.989
That's more reason to sit with her.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:26.325
Don't want her to go swallowing her tongue
or anything.

1:02:31.539 --> 1:02:32.749
Is this seat taken?

1:02:34.792 --> 1:02:35.793
Uh...

1:02:36.836 --> 1:02:37.670
No.

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:44.051
This was a mistake.

1:02:45.428 --> 1:02:49.640
Tell me about it. I can't believe
I let you convince me to go on a trip

1:02:49.724 --> 1:02:52.101
that requires getting up before 7:00.

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:13.039
Who goes to an EDM concert
on a school night?

1:03:13.122 --> 1:03:14.582
Uh, lots of people do.

1:03:14.665 --> 1:03:18.836
It wasn't necessarily like an EDM concert,
it was more like a rock...

1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:19.921
Oh, okay.

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:24.801
They said, "Greg, make sure everyone
sleeps in their assigned room."

1:03:24.884 --> 1:03:28.387
And I said, "Overruled,
sleep where you want, sluts."

1:03:30.139 --> 1:03:31.682
They're the chaperones?

1:03:31.766 --> 1:03:33.559
See you on Black Diamond, Peter?

1:03:33.935 --> 1:03:36.354
Last down the slope owes the other
a hot toddy.

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:40.942
-Go get your man.
-Are you kidding?

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:45.154
I can't go down the Black Diamond. I don't
even know how to put on the boots.

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:49.283
If you're not gonna ski, what are you
planning on doing all weekend?

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:51.244
I came prepared.

1:03:55.248 --> 1:03:59.877
Oh, no.
That is a major backslide for you. Lucas.

1:03:59.961 --> 1:04:00.962
What's up, dude?

1:04:01.045 --> 1:04:04.006
Can you help me convince LJ
to come ski with us?

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:09.053
Yeah, right. You think I'm going skiing?
It's cold outside, I don't do cold.

1:04:09.136 --> 1:04:10.137
What?

1:04:11.347 --> 1:04:13.224
Well, I have Korean face masks.

1:04:15.142 --> 1:04:17.812
So you guys have been faking it
this entire time?

1:04:17.895 --> 1:04:21.357
Yes, and you have to promise
not to tell anyone, okay?

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:24.110
It's just... I'm so confused.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:26.070
Just had to let it out.

1:04:27.989 --> 1:04:30.491
I do not care about the genesis
of it all.

1:04:30.616 --> 1:04:34.328
I just know homeboy likes you.
I can tell by the way he looks at you.

1:04:34.412 --> 1:04:38.082
-How does he look at me?
-Like you're a sexy little Rubik's Cube.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:41.294
He can't figure you out,
but he's having fun trying.

1:04:42.044 --> 1:04:46.090
It doesn't matter,
he's still so obsessed with Gen,

1:04:46.465 --> 1:04:49.719
and I'm just another of the stupid girls
who fell for Kavinsky.

1:04:50.011 --> 1:04:51.345
It's embarrassing!

1:04:52.638 --> 1:04:57.476
Look, every guy, you know,
gets a bit obsessed with, at first...

1:04:58.477 --> 1:04:59.520
you know...

1:05:00.187 --> 1:05:02.106
bow chicka wow wow...

1:05:02.773 --> 1:05:05.192
Okay, let's look at the facts, shall we?

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:10.197
The whole fake relationship was his idea,
you came up with a no-kissing rule,

1:05:10.281 --> 1:05:14.327
you're trying to break up with him,
and you're carb-loading with a gay man

1:05:14.410 --> 1:05:16.495
while he's probably waiting
in the hot tub.

1:05:17.121 --> 1:05:21.876
So I'd say if anyone stupidly fell
for someone who doesn't like them back,

1:05:22.335 --> 1:05:23.336
it's not you.

1:05:24.086 --> 1:05:25.129
It's Kavinsky.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.299
You think he's waiting for me
in the hot tub?

1:05:28.382 --> 1:05:29.425
Hell yeah!

she'd always play the song twice?

1:22:41.665 --> 1:22:44.709
At least,
usually till they'd kick us outta here.

1:22:44.793 --> 1:22:47.212

I didn't hear anything about it, though.

1:22:58.556 --> 1:23:01.935

1:23:04.104 --> 1:23:06.106
Okay, so that's good news, right?

1:23:06.314 --> 1:23:08.650
I'm officially back to being invisible.

1:23:09.693 --> 1:23:10.694
Hey...

1:23:29.754 --> 1:23:32.298
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

1:23:32.382 --> 1:23:36.928
You didn't even say it wasn't true?
You just let everyone think we had sex?

1:23:37.637 --> 1:23:39.723
I bet you're happy the video leaked.

1:23:41.307 --> 1:23:43.309
You gonna do something about this?

1:23:43.810 --> 1:23:45.437
Hey, everyone, listen up.

1:23:46.062 --> 1:23:50.358
Not that it's anyone's business,
but nothing happened in the hot tub.

1:23:51.234 --> 1:23:55.739
If I hear anybody talking about Lara Jean
or that video, I'm gonna kick your asses.

1:23:55.822 --> 1:23:57.157
You understand?

1:23:59.743 --> 1:24:01.369
Nice job, Kavinsky!

1:24:02.662 --> 1:24:04.205
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:24:04.539 --> 1:24:08.835
Look, I am really sorry about everything.
If I knew who did this--

1:24:08.918 --> 1:24:10.420
I know who did it.

1:24:10.837 --> 1:24:11.963
So should you.

1:24:13.631 --> 1:24:15.842
Yeah, okay. Let me talk to her, okay?

1:24:15.925 --> 1:24:18.636
No.
This is a fight I have to handle myself.

1:24:24.184 --> 1:24:26.561
Um, hi... Personal space, much?

1:24:26.644 --> 1:24:28.438
I know you posted that video.

1:24:29.355 --> 1:24:31.024
Nope, wasn't me.

1:24:31.608 --> 1:24:36.446
But just so you know,
if you have sex in a public place,

1:24:36.529 --> 1:24:38.239
you've gotta deal with consequences.

1:24:38.323 --> 1:24:43.161
It's bad enough if a guy were to do this,
but a girl? That's despicable.

1:24:43.828 --> 1:24:45.914
Yeah, like I said, I didn't do it.

1:24:46.831 --> 1:24:52.087
I'm glad someone did, though. Finally,
everyone is gonna see who you really are.

1:24:52.170 --> 1:24:53.546
What are you talking about?

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:57.050
Peter! He is not as confident
as he pretends to be.

1:24:58.176 --> 1:25:01.096
I am not as tough as I pretend to be.

1:25:02.013 --> 1:25:04.724
And you, Lara Jean Covey,

1:25:04.808 --> 1:25:07.560
you are not as innocent
as you pretend to be

1:25:07.644 --> 1:25:09.729
because you kissed a boy I liked.

1:25:09.813 --> 1:25:11.397
You guys were broken up.

1:25:11.481 --> 1:25:13.233
No, before we even dated!

1:25:14.192 --> 1:25:17.737
-Middle school?
-You knew I liked him and you kissed him.

1:25:17.821 --> 1:25:20.698
It was Spin the Bottle, you psycho,
and it was tongueless!

1:25:20.782 --> 1:25:22.200
It wasn't tongueless to me!

1:25:26.412 --> 1:25:27.455
[door slams shut]

1:25:27.539 --> 1:25:31.084
I always thought no one was paying
attention to what I was doing,

1:25:32.627 --> 1:25:35.380
that the only drama in my life
was in my head,

1:25:37.215 --> 1:25:40.635
but it turns out that
I wasn't as invisible as I thought.

1:25:43.012 --> 1:25:45.932
-So Margot left, huh?
-Yeah, this Sunday.

1:25:47.016 --> 1:25:48.852
Hey, thank you for coming over.

1:25:48.935 --> 1:25:50.520
Yeah, of course.

1:25:50.603 --> 1:25:53.106
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

1:25:53.898 --> 1:25:54.941
See...

1:25:55.525 --> 1:25:57.110
It's like driving, okay?

1:25:57.193 --> 1:25:59.821
I can imagine myself doing it
and it's fine,

1:25:59.904 --> 1:26:02.740
and then I get behind the wheel
and completely freeze up,

1:26:02.824 --> 1:26:04.492
and I don't know what to do.

1:26:04.576 --> 1:26:08.413
Okay... I don't follow.

1:26:10.039 --> 1:26:11.291
Let me start over.

1:26:14.169 --> 1:26:16.713
You were the first boy
I ever really liked.

1:26:17.463 --> 1:26:20.508
Everyone else, all the other letters,
were born out of fantasy.

1:26:22.010 --> 1:26:24.679
But yours was based off
of actually knowing you.

1:26:26.639 --> 1:26:31.311
I didn't realize how I felt about you
until you became Margot's boyfriend.

1:26:34.022 --> 1:26:37.025
But over time,
that feeling just faded away,

1:26:37.108 --> 1:26:38.818
and I missed my best friend.

1:26:39.611 --> 1:26:40.904
And it wasn't love.

1:26:42.030 --> 1:26:46.159
Why didn't you just tell me that?
I feel like I'd have understood.

1:26:46.242 --> 1:26:50.079
Well, I couldn't.
I didn't know until Peter.

1:26:53.750 --> 1:26:55.752
Right, Peter.

1:26:57.337 --> 1:26:59.172
It was real in a different way.

1:27:00.924 --> 1:27:02.258
And I'm really sorry.

1:27:03.635 --> 1:27:08.556
No reason to be sorry, it's like,
I think I know where you're coming from.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.767
It's kind of how it was with Margot and I.

1:27:11.893 --> 1:27:15.063
You know, minus all the fake stuff
and everything else.

1:27:16.522 --> 1:27:19.317
Did you stop loving Margot
after she broke up with you?

1:27:20.235 --> 1:27:22.820
No. Not at first.

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:27.825
At some point it changed, though.

1:27:28.576 --> 1:27:33.623
The longer she was gone,
the more I understood why she ended it.

1:27:37.335 --> 1:27:41.256
-Do you feel the same way about Peter?
-I know you don't like him.

1:27:42.924 --> 1:27:45.426
I like how he stood up for you today.

1:27:45.510 --> 1:27:47.345
He should have done it a lot sooner,

1:27:47.470 --> 1:27:50.848
but then again, he's a jock,
and they're slow learners.

1:27:51.182 --> 1:27:52.475
You are such a snob!

1:27:52.934 --> 1:27:53.935
Yeah.

1:27:55.645 --> 1:27:58.690
Look, if you miss him,
why don't you just tell him?

1:27:59.482 --> 1:28:00.316
I can't.

1:28:01.317 --> 1:28:02.485
And why's that?

1:28:04.904 --> 1:28:07.740
Because if it wasn't real,
I didn't lose anyone.

1:28:09.617 --> 1:28:13.496
But if I say that it was real,
and he still doesn't want me...

1:28:15.248 --> 1:28:16.791
Then at least you'll know.

1:28:17.417 --> 1:28:20.753
You've gotta tell people
how you feel when you feel it.

1:28:21.170 --> 1:28:25.091
You can't sit in your room writing
love letters you're never gonna send.

1:28:25.258 --> 1:28:27.427
Peter wouldn't even be in your life

1:28:27.510 --> 1:28:29.679
if they hadn't gotten out
in the first place.

1:28:29.762 --> 1:28:32.140
Yeah, you definitely have a point.

1:28:33.349 --> 1:28:36.561
I don't know, I'm just tired
of writing love letters.

1:28:36.936 --> 1:28:39.063
It'd be nice to be receiving them.

1:28:39.814 --> 1:28:42.317
Lara Jean, I have something for you.

1:28:43.109 --> 1:28:44.402
Don't kill me.

1:28:45.278 --> 1:28:48.406
It's just,
you were always throwing those away,

1:28:49.073 --> 1:28:52.327
and I thought they were something
you should keep.

1:28:53.911 --> 1:28:55.371
You saved all these?

1:29:03.129 --> 1:29:04.380
"Lara Jean,

1:29:04.464 --> 1:29:07.675
everyone was so impressed
by your presentation in lit,

1:29:08.009 --> 1:29:09.385
but especially me.

1:29:09.886 --> 1:29:12.764
I love having
a smarty pants fake girlfriend."

1:29:19.228 --> 1:29:22.607
"It's so cool how we can talk
to each other about real stuff."

1:29:28.905 --> 1:29:30.531
"You looked so pretty today."

1:29:32.950 --> 1:29:35.286
Still think
you haven't gotten a love letter?

1:30:41.644 --> 1:30:42.687
Hey.

1:30:44.021 --> 1:30:46.649
Hi. I have to tell you something.

1:30:50.528 --> 1:30:51.529
Okay.

1:30:53.114 --> 1:30:54.365
I drove here.

1:30:56.492 --> 1:30:57.493
Really?

1:30:59.245 --> 1:31:02.915
Wow, that's... that's...
that's great, congrats.

1:31:05.001 --> 1:31:06.627
-Thanks.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:31:09.380 --> 1:31:10.548
What's in your hand?

1:31:11.883 --> 1:31:13.009
Oh, uh, nothing.

1:31:13.718 --> 1:31:14.760
Oh, it's nothing?

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:25.813
If you want me to read that,
you need to give that to me.

1:31:29.025 --> 1:31:29.984
Um...

1:31:31.402 --> 1:31:32.737
Can you turn around?

1:31:34.489 --> 1:31:35.490
Please.

1:31:44.332 --> 1:31:45.333
"Dear Peter,

1:31:46.459 --> 1:31:48.085
I need you to know that..."

1:32:00.014 --> 1:32:03.017
I need you to know that I like you,
Peter Kavinsky.

1:32:04.143 --> 1:32:05.520
And not in a fake way.

1:32:08.147 --> 1:32:11.150
And so I guess
that's all I came here to say.

1:32:14.862 --> 1:32:18.824
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Don't I get to say something?

1:32:22.245 --> 1:32:25.831
The reason 
that I went to Gen's room that night,

1:32:27.375 --> 1:32:28.918
was to tell her that it's over,

1:32:30.711 --> 1:32:31.712
because...

1:32:35.925 --> 1:32:38.010
because I'm in love with you, Lara Jean.

1:32:39.428 --> 1:32:40.429
Only you.

1:32:42.223 --> 1:32:43.224
You're what?

1:32:45.226 --> 1:32:49.522
-Wait... How do we do this?
-What do you mean?

1:32:50.439 --> 1:32:53.359
What do you put into a contract
for a real relationship?

1:32:53.442 --> 1:32:54.485
Nothing.

1:32:56.612 --> 1:32:57.822
You gotta trust.

1:33:02.994 --> 1:33:04.912
You gonna break my heart, Covey?
