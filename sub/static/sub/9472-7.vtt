               ¶ ¶              

00:08.475 --> 00:12.644
     This week on "VICE":       
     Young people are rising    
     up in the West Bank.       

00:13.713 --> 00:16.280
        (speaking Arabic)       

00:18.051 --> 00:19.651
          (explosions)          

00:19.752 --> 00:23.788
    This is the kind of thing   
    that really pisses off      
    the Israeli soldiers,       

00:23.890 --> 00:26.391
   and now they've started      
   to shoot back live bullets.  

00:26.493 --> 00:30.828
  And then, the underground     
  cultural revolution in Cuba.  

00:30.930 --> 00:34.265
    Relations are normalizing   
    because all the young       
    people in Cuba              

00:34.367 --> 00:37.968
  are seeing how it is to live  
  in the rest of the world.     

00:38.071 --> 00:40.071
      (speaking in Spanish)     

00:43.677 --> 00:46.477
      (theme music playing)     

00:50.550 --> 00:51.616
            (gunshot)           

00:56.122 --> 00:58.856
     Crowd (chanting):          
     Hands up! Don't shoot!     
     Hands up!

01:07.900 --> 01:09.100
   The effort to broker peace   

01:09.202 --> 01:11.302
   between Israel               
   and the Palestinian people   

01:11.404 --> 01:13.137
 has been going on for decades, 

01:13.240 --> 01:15.773
    <i> and it has failed</i>          
    <i> at almost every step.</i>      

01:15.875 --> 01:18.743
     <i> Now, that hopelessness</i>    
     <i> has given fuel</i>            

01:18.845 --> 01:22.146
        to a new uprising       
        in the West Bank.       

01:22.249 --> 01:26.884
               ¶ ¶              

01:29.456 --> 01:31.556
       (indistinct chattering)  

01:34.894 --> 01:38.095
 Every single day for weeks now 
 Palestinians have been         
 coming here                    

01:38.197 --> 01:40.398
        and clashing with       
        Israeli soldiers.       

01:40.500 --> 01:42.533
       (tires screeching)       

01:53.747 --> 01:56.481
      (indistinct shouting)     

01:57.684 --> 02:00.117
      (speaking in English)     

02:00.219 --> 02:02.052
        (sirens blaring)        

02:15.402 --> 02:17.335
         Shihab-Eldin:          
    <i> All across Palestine,</i>      

02:17.437 --> 02:19.570
  <i> the youth are taking</i>         
  <i> to the streets to protest</i>    

02:19.673 --> 02:22.707
  <i> the current state of affairs</i> 
  <i> in the occupied West Bank.</i>   

02:28.682 --> 02:30.080
  We're in the heart of Hebron, 

02:30.183 --> 02:31.783
     which is,                  
     for many Palestinians,     

02:31.884 --> 02:33.418
    the most extreme example    
 (explosion)                    

02:33.520 --> 02:35.353
      of what life is like.     

02:35.455 --> 02:39.223
 This is the front line between 
 them and the Israeli soldiers  
 who've been firing tear gas.   

02:39.326 --> 02:43.260
  They're rolling tires across  
  the street with cardboard     
  in it burning.                

02:43.363 --> 02:46.864
    This is the kind of thing   
    that really pisses off      
    the Israeli soldiers,       

02:46.966 --> 02:48.966
   and now they've started      
   to shoot back live bullets.  

02:49.068 --> 02:50.768
           (gunshots)           

02:50.870 --> 02:54.138
      (indistinct shouting)     

02:55.442 --> 02:57.542
      <i> For decades,</i>             
      <i> the conflict here</i>        
      <i> has been stuck</i>           

02:57.644 --> 03:00.611
      <i> in the same cycle</i>        
      <i> of bloody violence...</i>    

03:06.553 --> 03:09.721
  <i> ...with near-constant</i>        
  <i> casualties on both sides.</i>    

03:14.093 --> 03:16.394
 <i> But what we found in</i>          
 <i> our time in the West Bank,</i>    

03:16.496 --> 03:19.630
<i>is today, the youth are</i>         
<i>the ones leading the uprising.</i>  

03:19.733 --> 03:23.434
 <i> And just like the young people</i>
 <i> behind the Arab Spring,</i>       

03:23.536 --> 03:27.304
  <i> these kids say</i>               
  <i> that their own government is</i> 
  <i> a big part of the problem.</i>   

03:28.975 --> 03:32.243
 (speaking in Arabic)           

03:44.090 --> 03:45.923
         Shihab-Eldin:          
     <i> The protests we saw</i>       

03:46.025 --> 03:48.292
   <i> were sparked completely</i>     
   <i> by the youth.</i>               

03:48.395 --> 03:51.629
<i>Even the volunteer medics</i>       
<i>that were treating the injured</i>  
<i>were kids.</i>                      

03:51.731 --> 03:54.131
 (speaking in foreign language) 

04:06.579 --> 04:08.646
          Shihab-Eldin:         
  <i> As the casualties poured in,</i> 

04:08.748 --> 04:10.548
   <i> we talked to the protesters</i> 
   <i> on the ground</i>               

04:10.650 --> 04:12.817
      <i> about why they are</i>       
      <i> risking their lives.</i>     

04:16.389 --> 04:18.523
   (speaking foreign language)  

04:40.413 --> 04:42.112
         Shihab-Eldin:          
       <i> The losses here</i>         
       <i> have continued,</i>         

04:42.214 --> 04:45.917
   <i> whether it's</i>                
   <i> from Israeli bullets</i>        
   <i> or Palestinian attacks.</i>     

04:47.420 --> 04:49.454
    <i> And with no leader</i>         
    <i> guiding the uprising,</i>      

04:49.556 --> 04:54.291
      <i> the situation is</i>         
      <i> only intensifying</i>        
      <i> on the ground.</i>           

04:54.393 --> 04:58.629
  <i> We spoke</i>                     
  <i> with Columbia University</i>     
  <i> professor Rashid Khalidi,</i>    

04:58.731 --> 05:01.933
<i>an expert on</i>                    
<i>the Israel-Palestine conflict.</i>  

05:02.034 --> 05:05.369
        What makes              
        this uprising different 
        than previous uprisings?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.038
First is the failure            
of the Palestinian leadership   

05:08.140 --> 05:11.008
<i>to do anything to relieve</i>       
<i>the sense of despair</i>            

05:11.110 --> 05:13.511
<i>that Palestinians</i>               
<i>have been feeling</i>               
<i>in the occupied territories</i>     

05:13.613 --> 05:15.613
<i>since the occupation began.</i>     

05:15.715 --> 05:18.583
The prospects                   
for young Palestinians          
are extraordinarily limited.    

05:18.685 --> 05:23.888
No horizon, no future.          
Things are much worse today     
after Oslo.                     

05:23.990 --> 05:27.959
         Shihab-Eldin:          
  <i> In 1993, the Oslo Accords</i>    
    <i> were supposed to begin</i>     

05:28.060 --> 05:31.428
    <i> a path towards peace,</i>      
    <i> and established</i>            
    <i> an interim government</i>      

05:31.531 --> 05:35.733
<i>in the West Bank known</i>          
<i>as the Palestinian Authority.</i>   

05:35.835 --> 05:39.570
   What was the expectation     
   of the Palestinian Authority?

05:39.672 --> 05:41.906
That this was the embryo        
 of a Palestinian state.        

05:42.008 --> 05:45.776
The Oslo agreement was          
supposed to accomplish          
a continued negotiation.        

05:45.879 --> 05:48.479
The hope was that it would      
lead to a two-state solution,   

05:48.581 --> 05:50.648
and the Palestinians could      
have some arrangement           

05:50.750 --> 05:52.750
for autonomy                    
or self-government              
within that.                    

05:52.852 --> 05:55.920
Unfortunately, it's deluding    
very few people in Palestine    

05:56.022 --> 05:58.523
and a lot of people outside     
into thinking the Palestinians  

05:58.625 --> 06:00.958
are well on the way             
to statehood. They're not.      

06:01.060 --> 06:03.928
They've moved away              
from self-determination         
since Oslo.                     

06:04.030 --> 06:07.398
      <i> So, in a sense,</i>          
      <i> the Palestinian Authority</i>
      <i> itself is an illusion?</i>   

06:07.500 --> 06:12.503
It is.                          
It's a cardboard facade         
behind which nothing exists.    

06:12.605 --> 06:15.339
          Shihab-Eldin:         
       <i> There haven't been</i>      
   <i> any presidential elections</i>  

06:15.441 --> 06:16.841
   <i> in more than ten years,</i>     

06:16.943 --> 06:19.644
<i>since President Mahmoud Abbas</i>   
<i>came to power.</i>                  

06:19.746 --> 06:22.179
     <i> And with polls showing</i>    
     <i> that nearly 70%</i>           

06:22.281 --> 06:24.381
  <i> of the population wanting</i>    
  <i> him out of office,</i>           

06:24.483 --> 06:27.117
    <i> the anger on the streets</i>   
    <i> is palpable.</i>               

06:27.219 --> 06:30.120
 (speaking in foreign language) 

06:56.215 --> 06:57.982
          Shihab-Eldin:         
      <i> Just down the street</i>     

06:58.084 --> 07:00.250
      <i> from Mahmoud Abbas'</i>      
      <i> presidential palace,</i>     

07:00.352 --> 07:04.221
<i>we found a group of protesters</i>  
<i>calling for him to step down.</i>   

07:05.825 --> 07:08.225
 (speaking in foreign language) 

07:38.524 --> 07:40.524
             Shihab-Eldin:      
       <i> A lot of the Palestinian</i>
            <i> youth tell us</i>      

07:40.627 --> 07:44.194
  that they see                 
  the Palestinian Authority     
  as a symbol of the occupation.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.830
                 Why would they 
                 be saying that?

07:45.932 --> 07:47.932
Well, the aspect of             
the Palestinian Authority       

07:48.034 --> 07:50.735
that's most unacceptable        
to Palestinians                 

07:50.837 --> 07:52.637
is its security                 
cooperation with Israel.        

07:52.739 --> 07:55.806
          Shihab-Eldin:         
      <i> That's because under</i>     
      <i> the Oslo Agreements</i>      

07:55.908 --> 08:00.144
 <i> the Palestinian Authority</i>     
 <i> security forces are charged</i>   
 <i> with maintaining the peace,</i>   

08:00.246 --> 08:03.580
    <i> which includes</i>             
    <i> suppressing protests.</i>      

08:03.683 --> 08:07.652
<i>But it's what the PA can't do</i>   
<i>that's angering</i>                 
<i>the Palestinians,</i>               

08:07.754 --> 08:10.187
   <i> which is their</i>              
   <i> inability to stop Israelis</i>  

08:10.289 --> 08:13.223
<i>from creating new settlements</i>   
<i>in the occupied West Bank.</i>      

08:13.325 --> 08:15.626
What has happened since 1967    

08:15.728 --> 08:20.430
is the establishment of         
communities of Israelis inside  
the occupied territories.       

08:20.533 --> 08:23.067
<i>Every place that a settler</i>      
<i>goes, the military goes.</i>        

08:23.169 --> 08:25.636
<i>Every place the military goes,</i>  
<i>restrictions against</i>            

08:25.738 --> 08:28.338
the native population,          
the Palestinians, follow.       

08:28.440 --> 08:32.376
This is why settlements         
are such an enormous factor     

08:32.477 --> 08:34.812
in the West Bank                
and occupied East Jerusalem.    

08:39.652 --> 08:42.886
          Shihab-Eldin:         
  <i> We met up with Daniel Luria,</i> 
  <i> the head of an organization</i>  

08:42.989 --> 08:45.756
<i>that helps move Jewish</i>          
<i>Israelis into East Jerusalem,</i>   

08:45.858 --> 08:49.694
   <i> reclaiming land they say</i>    
   <i> is theirs by divine right.</i>  

08:49.796 --> 08:53.130
          I'm gonna take you now
          to a predominantly    
          Arab neighborhood.    

08:53.232 --> 08:58.169
         And about 12 years ago,
         Jews started to return 
         to the old village.    

09:02.675 --> 09:05.342
      (speaking in English)     

09:11.584 --> 09:13.050
             Okay. Good to know.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.720
                 So you're      
                 carrying a gun?
           Yeah.                

09:16.923 --> 09:20.891
 (speaking in foreign language) 

09:20.993 --> 09:22.126
               What's he saying?

09:22.228 --> 09:26.030
      Um, he says               
      all of this is a lie,     

09:26.132 --> 09:28.165
      and you are robbers.      

09:30.837 --> 09:32.536
This is everything here.        
       This is the center of it.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.938
Whose land is this?             
                Right.          

09:34.040 --> 09:36.140
Whose land is Jerusalem?        
Whose land is Israel?           

09:36.242 --> 09:39.309
             Why can't it be    
             both people's land?

09:40.679 --> 09:42.179
   It can't be.                 
                  Why not?      

09:42.281 --> 09:43.413
   It doesn't work.             

09:43.515 --> 09:46.316
 (speaking in foreign language) 

09:49.889 --> 09:52.589
         You can tell that this 
         is as tense as it gets.

09:52.691 --> 09:54.191
Come, come, come!               

09:55.294 --> 09:58.295
Before 1948, this used to be    
an old synagogue.               

09:58.364 --> 10:00.131
              That's correct.   
And now...                      

10:00.233 --> 10:01.999
    It's been returned. Correct.
It's been returned.             

10:02.101 --> 10:04.534
So, last week there             
were families living here.      
                     Correct.   

10:04.637 --> 10:05.970
And they were                   
the ones who were...            

10:06.072 --> 10:08.105
  And those were illegally      
  squatting in an old synagogue.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.407
For 77 years,                   
they were living here.          

10:10.509 --> 10:11.942
         In a synagogue.        

10:14.280 --> 10:17.248
        Shihab-Eldin:           
   <i> Reconstruction started</i>      
     <i> here immediately,</i>         

10:17.349 --> 10:20.284
<i>but this isn't the only</i>         
<i>new settlement on this block.</i>   

10:20.386 --> 10:23.821
       <i> We met a couple</i>         
    <i> just as they moved in</i>      
       <i> down the street.</i>        

10:23.923 --> 10:25.289
        So, when do you move in?

10:25.391 --> 10:26.824
   (speaking foreign language)  

10:26.926 --> 10:28.525
           Straight away.       
           It's their honeymoon.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.427
      He just got married,      
       he's moving in now.      

10:30.529 --> 10:32.529
          Shihab-Eldin:         
      <i> But as settlers were</i>     
     <i> moving into one house,</i>    

10:32.631 --> 10:36.500
 <i> we met a Palestinian family</i>   
 <i> that was being evicted</i>        
 <i> from theirs.</i>                  

10:36.602 --> 10:38.869
 (speaking in foreign language) 

10:49.381 --> 10:52.183
          Shihab-Eldin:         
     <i> As both sides maintain</i>    
      <i> claims to the land,</i>      

10:52.285 --> 10:56.420
<i>the Israeli settler population</i>  
<i>has increased dramatically.</i>     

10:56.522 --> 11:00.124
The settler population has      
tripled in the last 25 years.   

11:00.226 --> 11:04.295
<i>There were a couple</i>             
<i>hundred thousand after</i>          
<i>about 25 years of occupation.</i>   

11:04.396 --> 11:08.732
There are another 400,000       
for a total of 600,000 today.   

11:10.102 --> 11:11.635
        Shihab-Eldin:           
    <i> The Palestinians see</i>       

11:11.737 --> 11:14.071
      <i> these settlements</i>        
      <i> as a provocation.</i>        

11:14.173 --> 11:15.940
     <i> But when they clash</i>       
     <i> with settlers,</i>            

11:16.042 --> 11:19.443
<i>Israel escalates its security</i>   
<i>measures across the region.</i>     

11:19.545 --> 11:22.980
      <i> Nowhere is this</i>          
      <i> more pronounced than</i>     
      <i> the city of Hebron.</i>      

11:23.049 --> 11:25.983
  So, right now we're crossing  
  through one of the checkpoints
  in Hebron.                    

11:27.753 --> 11:31.755
   <i> Security is so tight here,</i>  
   <i> the city's been divided</i>     
   <i> into sections,</i>              

11:31.858 --> 11:35.292
     <i> with the majority</i>         
     <i> of Palestinians living</i>    
     <i> in an area called H1,</i>     

11:35.394 --> 11:39.230
    <i> and the Israeli settlers</i>   
         <i> living in H2,</i>         
    <i> which is where we were.</i>    

11:39.332 --> 11:42.733
  All of the shops are closed.  
  There's absolutely no one     
  in the streets.               

11:42.835 --> 11:44.401
   It feels like a ghost town.  

11:44.503 --> 11:47.637
  <i> This street we're walking on</i> 
  <i> has been off-limits</i>          
  <i> to Palestinians</i>              

11:47.740 --> 11:50.107
    <i> for years by order</i>         
    <i> of the Israeli military.</i>   

11:50.209 --> 11:52.109
     Right over there is        
     a Palestinian cemetery.    

11:52.211 --> 11:54.544
     If you look,               
     all of the tombstones      
     are written in Arabic.     

11:54.646 --> 11:58.849
  It's literally two feet away  
  from a street where           
  Palestinians can't come.      

12:02.154 --> 12:05.322
 <i> And even on the Palestinian</i>   
 <i> side back in H1,</i>              

12:05.424 --> 12:08.859
     <i> we could see how rigid</i>    
     <i> this divide was.</i>          

12:09.828 --> 12:12.062
 (speaking in foreign language) 

12:42.962 --> 12:44.828
         Shihab-Eldin:          
<i>As more and more kids grow up</i>   

12:44.931 --> 12:46.596
       <i> under the rules</i>         
       <i> of this agreement,</i>      

12:46.698 --> 12:52.303
    <i> it will only feed</i>          
    <i> into more violence</i>         
    <i> and a furthering divide.</i>   

12:52.405 --> 12:55.739
<i>Dr. Hanan Ashrawi was involved</i>  
<i>in the early negotiations</i>       

12:55.841 --> 12:57.174
       <i> of the Middle East</i>      
       <i> peace process,</i>          

12:57.276 --> 13:00.210
 <i> and a former member of</i>        
 <i> the Palestinian Authority.</i>    

13:00.313 --> 13:03.347
Young Palestinians              
taking to the streets           
and throwing rocks              

13:03.449 --> 13:06.450
say they're                     
not just disillusioned          
by the occupation,              

13:06.552 --> 13:09.486
they tell us                    
they're disillusioned           
by their own government.        

13:09.588 --> 13:12.756
 The Palestinian Authority      
is part of the occupation.      

13:12.858 --> 13:16.460
            We're not surprised 
           that the young people
            are disillusioned,  

13:16.562 --> 13:17.828
           <i> and they are angry.</i> 

13:17.930 --> 13:20.264
        <i> They're sending a clear</i>
        <i> message to the world.</i>  

13:20.366 --> 13:23.233
   The peace agenda,            
   the negotiated settlement,   

13:23.336 --> 13:25.135
          the two-state solution
          has not worked.       

13:25.237 --> 13:26.903
             The leadership     
             could not deliver. 

13:27.006 --> 13:29.440
It seems like                   
there's a bigger                
and bigger disconnect.          

13:29.541 --> 13:30.841
       There is a wide gap, yes.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.642
               These perceptions
               are cumulative.  

13:32.744 --> 13:35.012
         If you allow           
         your system to atrophy,

13:35.114 --> 13:36.913
            your leadership     
            to become geriatric,

13:37.016 --> 13:40.884
   <i> then of course you're going</i> 
   <i> to have a situation of total</i>
   <i> discontent and anger.</i>       

13:40.987 --> 13:44.754
           The only way forward 
           is through elections.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.991
       We need elections,       
       we need a new leadership,

13:47.093 --> 13:49.193
           and we need the youth
           to be part of this.  

13:49.295 --> 13:52.629
         Shihab-Eldin:          
<i>Until that happens, the youth</i>   
<i>seem to only gain more resolve</i>  

13:52.731 --> 13:56.967
  <i> in their anger towards</i>       
  <i> both the occupation</i>          
  <i> and their own government.</i>    

13:58.270 --> 14:01.271
   (speaking foreign language)  

14:25.664 --> 14:29.466
        (sirens blaring)        

14:33.839 --> 14:36.306
      America and Cuba          
      have been adversaries     

14:36.409 --> 14:40.077
  since Fidel Castro's          
  Communist revolution in 1959. 

14:40.179 --> 14:43.280
 But this month President Obama 
 has made history               

14:43.382 --> 14:48.919
  by becoming the first         
  sitting US president to visit 
  the country in 88 years.      

14:49.021 --> 14:50.820
  We're focused on the future.  

14:50.923 --> 14:53.757
 And I'm absolutely confident   
 that if we stay on this course 

14:53.859 --> 14:56.460
     we can deliver a better    
     and brighter future        

14:56.562 --> 14:59.129
    for both the Cuban people   
    and the American people.    

14:59.231 --> 15:00.431
       So,<i> muchas gracias.</i>      

15:00.533 --> 15:03.367
   It's part of the so-called   
   "Obama Doctrine,"            

15:03.469 --> 15:05.069
     which is                   
     the president's policy     

15:05.171 --> 15:07.904
      <i> of re-engaging with</i>      
      <i> traditional enemies.</i>     

15:08.006 --> 15:10.307
    And we've been following    
    the process with Cuba       

15:10.409 --> 15:14.378
   since last year at the 2015  
   Summit of the Americas.      

15:14.480 --> 15:19.950
               ¶ ¶              

15:24.957 --> 15:27.691
        (sirens blaring)        

15:32.198 --> 15:35.265
  Smith:                        
  We're here in Panama City     
  at the Summit of the Americas.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.969
   And it's a historic summit   
   because for the first time   
   since Eisenhower,            

15:39.071 --> 15:41.538
   the head of state of Cuba,   
   Raúl Castro,                 

15:41.640 --> 15:43.840
  and the head of state         
  of America, President Obama,  

15:43.942 --> 15:44.975
     are gonna actually meet    

15:45.077 --> 15:47.043
     for the purpose of         
     normalizing relations.     

15:47.146 --> 15:53.584
   Point is,                    
   the United States will not   
   be imprisoned by the past.   

15:53.685 --> 15:55.785
   We're looking to the future  

15:55.887 --> 15:59.456
  and to policies that improve  
  the lives of the Cuban people 

15:59.558 --> 16:04.728
  and advance                   
  the interests of cooperation  
  in the hemisphere.            

16:04.830 --> 16:07.631
      (speaking in Spanish)     

16:14.039 --> 16:16.206
             Smith:             
      <i> Now these statements</i>     
        <i> both represented</i>       

16:16.308 --> 16:20.344
  <i> a sea-change in relations</i>    
   <i> between the US and Cuba.</i>    

16:20.446 --> 16:24.414
    <i> The Obama Doctrine</i>         
    <i> is this administration's</i>   
    <i> foreign policy shift,</i>      

16:24.517 --> 16:27.651
    <i> which now engages</i>          
    <i> in dialogue and treaties</i>   

16:27.753 --> 16:29.486
     <i> with countries like</i>       
     <i> Iran and Cuba</i>             

16:29.588 --> 16:31.755
<i>that have long been considered</i>  
<i>our enemies.</i>                    

16:31.857 --> 16:33.723
      <i> But this decision</i>        
      <i> in particular</i>            

16:33.825 --> 16:37.227
  <i> marks a huge leap forward</i>    
  <i> in our relations.</i>            

16:37.329 --> 16:39.363
<i>Now, that's because</i>             
<i>at the height of the Cold War,</i>  

16:39.465 --> 16:42.032
  <i> the Soviet Union deployed</i>    
   <i> nuclear missiles to Cuba</i>    

16:42.134 --> 16:44.968
   <i> as a strategic check</i>        
   <i> against American power.</i>     

16:45.070 --> 16:48.038
  <i> This triggered</i>               
  <i> the Cuban missile crisis,</i>    

16:48.140 --> 16:49.906
      <i> which brought the US</i>     
      <i> and the Soviet Union</i>     

16:50.008 --> 16:52.842
   <i> to the brink</i>                
   <i> of all-out nuclear war.</i>     

16:52.944 --> 16:54.311
      <i> But even though</i>          
      <i> the crisis ended,</i>        

16:54.413 --> 16:56.547
  <i> the US tightened</i>             
  <i> its economic embargo on Cuba,</i>

16:56.649 --> 16:59.883
   <i> and travel between the two</i>  
   <i> was totally cut off,</i>        

16:59.985 --> 17:04.454
  <i> thereby isolating</i>            
  <i> the Cuban people for more</i>    
  <i> than half a century.</i>         

17:04.557 --> 17:08.791
 <i> Now, to gauge</i>                 
 <i> the attitude within</i>           
 <i> the Cuban government today,</i>   

17:08.894 --> 17:10.560
   <i> we spoke with Abel Prieto,</i>  

17:10.663 --> 17:14.198
  <i> a former minister of culture</i> 
  <i> and a close Castro aide.</i>     

17:15.934 --> 17:20.637
For our audience,               
which is mostly young people,   

17:20.739 --> 17:23.207
there's a fascination           
with Cuba.                      

17:23.309 --> 17:24.741
I was wondering                 
if you could talk a little bit  

17:24.843 --> 17:27.109
about the cultural aspects      
of what's happening in Cuba.    

17:27.213 --> 17:28.978
      (speaking in Spanish)     

18:07.720 --> 18:09.386
We would love to.               

18:12.090 --> 18:14.057
             Smith:             
         <i> So we accepted</i>        
         <i> his invitation</i>        

18:14.159 --> 18:16.893
   <i> to see what's actually</i>      
   <i> happening on the ground</i>     
   <i> in Cuba.</i>                    

18:16.995 --> 18:20.029
     <i> Because we had heard</i>      
     <i> that the country's</i>        
     <i> large youth population</i>    

18:20.132 --> 18:25.068
  <i> was playing a big part in</i>    
  <i> forcing the regime to change</i> 
  <i> its policies.</i>                

18:25.170 --> 18:27.337
    <i> And ground zero</i>            
    <i> for this social movement</i>   

18:27.439 --> 18:30.607
  <i> is Alamar, Cuba's largest</i>    
  <i> housing project,</i>             

18:30.709 --> 18:33.777
     <i> which is a hotbed</i>         
     <i> for political dissent.</i>    

18:35.213 --> 18:37.648
   <i> Edgaro Gonzalez grew up</i>     
   <i> in Alamar</i>                   

18:37.750 --> 18:40.717
  <i> and explained to me just how</i> 
  <i> music had bridged the divide</i> 

18:40.819 --> 18:42.552
  <i> between Cuba and America.</i>    

18:42.655 --> 18:44.821
So, I grew up in this.          
Like, every day, all day,       

18:44.923 --> 18:47.257
all we did all day was          
listen to hip-hop all day.      

18:47.359 --> 18:49.826
           Smith:               
           And how did you learn
           how to speak English?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.461
I listened to Biggie            
every day.                      

18:51.563 --> 18:52.796
                         Yeah.  
         You know?              

18:52.864 --> 18:54.731
       This was my house.       
                           Okay.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.801
I had the only entrance         
to the rooftop over there.      

18:57.903 --> 19:00.103
You know, you just              
went up to the rooftop          

19:00.205 --> 19:02.205
and tried to get                
some signal from Key West.      

19:02.308 --> 19:05.742
            Smith:              
 <i> Though Cuba has been cut off</i>  
<i>politically for over 50 years,</i>  

19:05.844 --> 19:09.145
      <i> their close</i>              
      <i> geographic proximity</i>     
      <i> has actually allowed</i>     

19:09.247 --> 19:11.848
     <i> for music to be shared</i>    
     <i> over the radio.</i>           

19:11.950 --> 19:14.217
 And you just, you know,        
move the antenna around.        

19:14.320 --> 19:16.520
         So, you kinda put it up
         to try to get a signal?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.555
Yeah, try to get a signal.      
                   From Florida.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.056
Yeah, right there.              

19:20.158 --> 19:23.026
        So, what effect did that
        have on the young people
        who live here in Alamar?

19:23.128 --> 19:25.295
Whoa. You know,                 
they be kind of                 
letting love for hip-hop.       

19:25.397 --> 19:27.931
Everybody knew every            
character of the Wu-Tang Clan.  

19:28.033 --> 19:30.334
People love American culture.   

19:32.504 --> 19:35.505
      (speaking in Spanish)     

19:50.288 --> 19:53.657
When we were starting doing     
hip-hop, it got really popular  

19:53.759 --> 19:57.060
the government started          
realizing and said, "Yo,        
we gotta shut this down."       

20:03.068 --> 20:06.169
    And so Reggaeton now        
    would be the most popular   
    in Alamar?                  

20:11.977 --> 20:13.209
             Smith:             
       <i> Now the reason why</i>      

20:13.311 --> 20:15.044
   <i> the government would want</i>   
   <i> to control the music scene</i>  

20:15.146 --> 20:17.681
     <i> is that for decades</i>       
      <i> it was policy here</i>       

20:17.783 --> 20:20.283
      <i> to denounce</i>              
      <i> all things American.</i>

<i>old Cold War rhetoric,</i>          

20:38.537 --> 20:40.704
 <i> the regime is still putting</i>   
 <i> this out today,</i>               

20:40.806 --> 20:44.574
<i>as we saw firsthand at</i>          
<i>the Museum of the Revolution.</i>   

20:45.944 --> 20:47.711
We got the cowboy.              

20:47.813 --> 20:50.614
We got the Caesar.              
Is that Caesar?                 

20:50.716 --> 20:53.450
Bush Jr.                        

20:53.552 --> 20:55.585
       (speaking Spanish)       

21:01.727 --> 21:05.161
     So they're saying thank you
     for being such a bad guy   

21:05.263 --> 21:06.763
              that we then      
              have a revolution.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.932
       So, it goes from         
       Batista to Reagan.       

21:09.034 --> 21:10.634
        What does it say        
        about Reagan?           

21:27.619 --> 21:28.819
            Smith:              
  <i> But what we found out was</i>    

21:28.921 --> 21:31.187
<i>that the bridge between</i>         
<i>cultures couldn't be stopped.</i>   

21:31.289 --> 21:33.389
     <i> And the government was</i>    
     <i> speaking one way,</i>

   <i> and the people another.</i>     

21:36.962 --> 21:40.997

      in Havana with the biggest
      Reggaeton star.           

21:41.099 --> 21:42.999
   And we're gonna interview him
   and talk about Reggaeton     

21:43.101 --> 21:46.336
  and how that's pushed all     
  of these changes even further 

21:46.438 --> 21:48.839
  'cause the government tried   
  to stop it, but they couldn't 

21:48.941 --> 21:51.107

    It goes out all weekend,    

25:25.323 --> 25:28.357

    are normalizing.            

25:28.459 --> 25:30.326
      Because all the young     
      people in Cuba            

25:30.428 --> 25:33.830
  are seeing how it is to live

<i>on our side, it's been driven</i>   
<i>by our political leaders.</i>       

25:43.608 --> 25:45.474
 <i> So we spoke to Ben Rhodes,</i>    

25:45.577 --> 25:47.343
       <i> the deputy national</i>     
       <i> security advisor</i>

In the policy changes           
the president announced,        

25:54.720 --> 25:57.687
in addition to                  
the normalization               
in diplomatic relations,        

25:57.789 --> 26:00.890
we basically are facilitating   
any type of travel that can     
be permitted                    

26:00.992 --> 26:03.193
under a general license,        
which will make it              
much easier.                    

26:03.294 --> 26:05.962
But we also authorized          
certain commercial activity.    

26:06.064 --> 26:07.731

<i>companies to help develop</i>

26:13.438 --> 26:18.274
You'll start to see             
an opening, in certainly        
the economic space.             

26:18.376 --> 26:20.910

<i>and Major League Baseball</i>       
<i>looking to go down there.</i>       

26:24.015 --> 26:28.151
Essentially, a flood            
of interaction between          
Americans and Cubans            

26:28.253 --> 26:30.920
that hasn't taken place         
in over 50 years.               

26:31.022 --> 26:36.793
       Is this part of this new 
       unfolding Obama Doctrine?

26:36.895 --> 26:38.327
Absolutely, it is.              

26:38.429 --> 26:40.864
And the president's view        
is we don't lose anything       
through engagement.             

26:40.966 --> 26:42.698
We can break out of the past,   

26:42.801 --> 26:45.769
but that doesn't mean we have   
to compromise our values.       

26:45.871 --> 26:47.937

making this change,

the things that America         
cares about."                   

26:50.142 --> 26:52.175
Well no, we actually think      
this is a better way            

26:52.277 --> 26:55.245

to normalize                    
relations with Cuba.            

27:40.826 --> 27:45.228
But as of today, Rubio from     
Florida, Cruz from Texas,       

27:45.330 --> 27:50.433
would probably try to push      
back the advances that Obama    
and your government have made.  

27:50.535 --> 27:51.701
Do you think about that?        

27:51.803 --> 27:53.970
           The changes          
           and the announcements

27:54.072 --> 27:56.772
    have been made              
    through executive decisions.

27:56.875 --> 28:03.446
     The next American president
     can undo through the same  
     ways, means,               

28:03.548 --> 28:05.315
   what has been done so far.   

28:05.416 --> 28:08.284
       But I don't think it will
       be easy to do that.      

28:08.386 --> 28:10.987
  Because this is good, not only
  for our both countries,       

28:11.089 --> 28:12.956
         but also for the region
        and for the whole world.

28:13.058 --> 28:17.693
       And I see having         
       a respectful relationship
       that can enrich Cuba     

28:17.795 --> 28:19.795
      and that can              
      enrich the Americans too. 

28:19.865 --> 28:22.631
            Smith:              
  <i> So what President Obama's</i>    
         <i> visit marks</i>           

28:22.734 --> 28:24.433
     <i> is a step where two</i>       
     <i> traditional enemies</i>       

28:24.535 --> 28:27.337
     <i> are for the first time</i>    
     <i> starting a dialogue.</i>      

28:27.438 --> 28:31.140
If you look at the Iran deal,   
the Cuba policy,                

28:31.243 --> 28:33.843
these are seen as these         
hugely controversial things,    

28:33.945 --> 28:36.545
but Americans                   
generally support them.         

28:36.647 --> 28:37.881
                           Sure.
Washington doesn't.             

28:37.983 --> 28:41.717
For whatever reason,            
it's easier to bomb             
another country                 

28:41.819 --> 28:44.787
than it is to sometimes         
engage a certain country.       

28:44.890 --> 28:47.357
<i>If this is really about</i>         
<i>helping the Cuban people,</i>       

28:47.458 --> 28:51.727
<i>97% of the Cuban people</i>         
<i>support normalization</i>           
<i>with the United States.</i>         

28:51.829 --> 28:53.529
<i>What will be</i>                    
<i>interesting to watch</i>            

28:53.631 --> 28:55.498
<i>is how the interaction</i>          
<i>with the United States</i>          

28:55.600 --> 28:57.233
and the interconnection         
with the rest of the world      

28:57.335 --> 29:01.204
helps normalize, not just       
the relationship between        
the United States and Cuba,     

29:01.306 --> 29:05.441
but Cuba's own position in      
the hemisphere and the world.   

29:07.312 --> 29:10.079
