Excellent texture, provocative support.
Try another, you say?

00:42.209 --> 00:44.169
Aren't I the wicked one?

00:44.628 --> 00:48.090
Stewie, I've told you before,
don't eat dirt. It's disgusting.

00:48.173 --> 00:51.343
And I suppose the bilious curds
you force-fed me from your teat...

00:51.426 --> 00:52.594
...were perfectly fine then?

CLEVELAND: Hi. You've got our votes.
LOIS: Thank you, Cleveland.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.067
Someone has to run against
that awful Betsy Lebeau.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.279
She actually opposes background checks
for new teachers!

01:10.362 --> 01:12.239
God knows who she might hire.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.951
TEACHER: So the square of a hypotenuse,

acute angles A and B...

of the squares of the other sides.

Any questions?

01:28.130 --> 01:29.882
It's just something I have to do.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.886
Even if winning means spending time
out of the house and away from my family.

01:33.969 --> 01:37.639
Out of the house? Why, I'd be free
from your oppressive gynocracy!

01:37.723 --> 01:41.977
You should be out giving speeches,
shaking hands, kissing babies!

01:43.478 --> 01:44.980

PETER: Lois, what's with the sign?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.409
Peter, we discussed this.
I'm running for School Board.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.952
You never listen to me.

Yeah, I remember.
Hey, Cleveland. Hey, Quagmire.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.249
Lois, what's with the sign?

02:04.333 --> 02:08.128
You guys? Chris' principal just called.
Chris is in trouble.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.547
That's it! I'm calling the cops!

02:11.840 --> 02:14.051
PRINCIPAL: Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.762
I caught your son peeking
into the girls' locker room.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.013
Oh, Chris!

02:18.096 --> 02:21.183
So what's the big deal? It's normal
for a boy his age to be curious.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.727
I remember when I first noticed
girls starting to develop.

PRESENTER: Welcome to
eighth grade orientation, everyone.

tonight, young man.

Your mother is right, son.
Listen to what it says.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.586
-Peter!
-I didn't say that.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.088
Lee Majors did.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.841
What? Women are things.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.512
Oh, my God! It's Mr. Fargas!

02:58.595 --> 03:00.347
He was my favorite teacher!

03:00.764 --> 03:04.768
Take out your scalpels, kids.
We're going to dissect a clown!

[Students gasping]

[Scalpel cutting tissue]

03:09.273 --> 03:13.277
No wonder this clown died.
His lungs are filled with candy!

03:14.611 --> 03:16.363
Why don't you go say hello?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.283
I'm gonna drop off some campaign flyers
in the teachers' lounge.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.286
PETER: Hey, Mr. Fargas!
It's me, Peter Griffin!

03:22.953 --> 03:25.664
Griffin. Sorry, not on the list.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.458
Don't you remember me?
I was your favorite student.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.544
You taught me everything. Math, science.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.714
You even taught me how
to dance just in time for the prom.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.549
Peter, you start like this.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.718
Like this?

03:38.802 --> 03:41.722
Yeah. Now add a little turn
and do a buck and wing.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.808
Come on, Mr. Fargas,
do the whole darn thing.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.397
Jeez, Mr. Fargas, what happened to you?
Somebody give you a fun-ectomy?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.858
No, they gave me these
by order of the School Board.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.402
They said it evens me out.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.573
FARGAS: Sorry to fly off the handle.
PETER: Here, let me see that.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.035
That's what I think about you taking
chill pills from the Man.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.413
Look, the old Farg made learning fun.
He's what these kids need.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.666
Now get back in that classroom
and teach your "Fargin"' ass off.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.550
Chris, your mother wants me and you
to have a talk.

04:18.634 --> 04:19.676
CHRIS: No!

04:21.053 --> 04:22.846
I was going for a new record.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.600
Now, son, as men, it's only natural for us
to look at naked girls.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.894
Every man does it, even Mr. Rogers.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.898
Hello, neighbor.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.025

04:35.692 --> 04:38.987
But peeping can be dangerous,
so I brought you this.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.993
-Wow! Miss December!
-Yep, the old skin bin.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.413
Now you can look at naked girls
all you want and it's perfectly legal!

04:48.497 --> 04:51.500
Wow, check out the rack on... Mom?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.043
Give me that!

04:53.210 --> 04:56.880
Just a little present your mom gave me
for our anniversary.

can you fix it so I win Homecoming Queen?

05:16.275 --> 05:18.861
Honey, of course I can.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.030
But winning without honor
isn't really winning at all.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.992

-No, it's just as good.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.604
...Randall Fargas seems to have gone
horribly wrong.

We now go live to Action News 5
Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa.

Tom, the eggs being dropped behind me
are not chicken eggs...

California condor.

Welcome back, Fargas.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.912
Oh, my God. He's gonna wipe
that species off the face of the earth!

06:09.995 --> 06:11.955
No, Lois. The janitor'll do that.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.708
I'm getting word
that the Quahog School Board...

06:14.791 --> 06:19.379
...has just dismissed Randall Fargas,
ending his 32-year teaching career.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.717
-What? They can't do that!
-Peter, the man is obviously unbalanced.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.970
In other news, Betsy Lebeau,
School Board President candidate...

06:27.054 --> 06:29.223
...announced today she's pulling out
of the race.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.893
Lebeau's withdrawal leaves housewife,
Lois Griffin, running unopposed.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.979
My goodness! I win by default!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.607
Great. You can get Mr. Fargas
his job back.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.068
I'm sorry! But I do have a mind of my own!

06:41.151 --> 06:43.987
And I happen to agree
with the School Board's decision.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.740
I know you're a feminist
and I think that's adorable...

06:46.823 --> 06:49.201
...but this is grown-up time
and I'm the man.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.913
I'm not giving that lunatic his job back
and that's final.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.960
Lois, I can't let you deprive our children
of a fine teacher like Mr. Fargas.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.295
I'm gonna stop you the only way I can...

07:00.379 --> 07:02.089
...by killing you...

07:02.172 --> 07:04.883
...in the race for School Board President!

07:11.223 --> 07:14.184
Peter, are you sure running against Lois
is such a good idea?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.061
You know how competitive you get.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.730
I can be just as non-competitive
as anybody.

07:18.814 --> 07:22.109
Matter of fact,
I'm the most non-competitive. So I win.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.695
Come on, you can't even handle
losing at checkers.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.968
Peter, since when do you care
about the School Board?

07:48.051 --> 07:50.345
Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap...

07:50.429 --> 07:53.599
...and if running against you
is the only way to get him back...

07:53.682 --> 07:56.894
...then I am gonna run
like the Six Million Dollar Man.

pull any punches on the issues.

than running unopposed.

Is that so?

TOM: Mr. Griffin,
your opening statement, please.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.447
Okay, I'm Peter Griffin. Vote for me.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.494
-Is that it?
-No, this is it.

13:05.577 --> 13:09.206
This is life, the one you get,
so go and have a ball...

13:09.289 --> 13:12.292
...because the world don't move
to the beat of just one drum.

13:12.376 --> 13:15.254
What might be right for you,
may not be right for some.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.089
You take the good, you take the bad...

13:17.172 --> 13:20.509
...you take them both, and there you have
my opening statement.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.845
Sit, Ubu, sit. Good dog.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.222
Okay. Mrs. Griffin?

13:25.389 --> 13:29.685
As a piano teacher, I know how
difficult the education process can be.

13:31.436 --> 13:36.316
That's why, if I'm elected, I promise
to fight for competent teachers...

13:36.441 --> 13:39.862
...a better-funded music department
and updated textbooks...

13:39.945 --> 13:43.740
...that don't refer to the
Civil Rights Movement as "trouble ahead."

[Cheering]

13:44.992 --> 13:46.827
Mr. Griffin, your response?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.704
Maybe something about education?

13:48.787 --> 13:51.623
I have always cared deeply
about young people.

13:51.707 --> 13:55.794
As a rich college-bound student, I once
joined some underprivileged youths...

13:55.878 --> 13:59.464
...in saving a community center
from being converted into a shopping mall.

13:59.590 --> 14:00.883
[Cheering]

14:01.758 --> 14:03.135
Peter, that wasn't you.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.680
That was Adolpho Shabba-Doo
in Breakin' II: Electric Boogaloo.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.265
You watched it last night.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.017
[Booing]

14:12.060 --> 14:13.896
So you're calling me a liar?

14:13.979 --> 14:16.773
I'm gonna take the highroad
and stick to the issues.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.526
The children of Quahog
are our greatest treasure.

14:19.610 --> 14:23.530
They deserve a school board president who
doesn't leave their feminine ointments...

14:23.614 --> 14:27.451
...in the fridge next to the mustard!
That was the worst hot dog I ever ate!

14:28.202 --> 14:30.871
Yeah, she flosses in bed,
she snores like a wildebeest--

14:30.954 --> 14:33.040
TOM: Thank you, Mr. Griffin.
We now move on--

14:33.123 --> 14:35.334
Wait a second, blow dryer,
I'm not done yet.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.377
She freed Willie Horton,
nailed Donna Rice--

14:37.461 --> 14:39.713
-Peter, that's enough!
-Eats babies.

14:40.255 --> 14:44.092
CROWD: [Chanting] Peter, Peter.
LOIS: Just a minute. Listen to me, please!

14:45.177 --> 14:48.347
This election
is about our children's future.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.598
So ask yourself...

14:49.681 --> 14:52.017
...what kind of future
will it be if you elect

14:52.100 --> 14:54.561
a man who has never taught a student...

14:54.811 --> 14:57.105
...or even been to a PTA meeting.

14:57.231 --> 15:00.734
This is a man who believes the plural
of "goose" is "sheep"!

15:00.817 --> 15:02.236
[Audience muttering]

15:02.319 --> 15:05.614
I'm the right person for the job.
Vote for me.

15:05.864 --> 15:06.865
CROWD: Lois!

15:08.825 --> 15:11.411
Wait, I'm not done.

15:12.120 --> 15:17.918
Peter! Come on! Stop.
Shut up! You guys shut up!

15:20.462 --> 15:24.258
LOIS: I didn't enjoy humiliating Peter,
but what choice did I have?

15:24.633 --> 15:27.010
That's okay, Lois. I enjoyed it.

15:27.344 --> 15:31.348
As soon as the polls close,
we can put all this ugliness behind us.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.684
PETER: Lois Griffin is a slut.
LOIS: What?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.978
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.980
I grew up in this town.

15:38.063 --> 15:41.275
Quahog needs a moral,
upstanding school board president.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.110
Someone we can trust.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.154
A lot of nasty things
have been said during this campaign.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.198
But pictures are better than words...

15:48.282 --> 15:50.951
...because some words are
big and hard to understand.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.954
But here's something
everyone can understand!

15:54.037 --> 15:57.624
Do you really want your children's future
in the hands of this?

15:59.501 --> 16:00.586
I know I don't.

16:00.669 --> 16:04.298
CLEVELAND: Paid for by the Peter Griffin
for School Board President Committee.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.383
Sorry, Lois.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.638
"Lewd," "obscene,"
and "a little blurry"...

16:11.722 --> 16:15.434
...just some of the words used to describe
Lois Griffin's prurient pic.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.145
-Good morning. I'm Tom Tucker.
-And I'm Diane Simmons.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.355
Yesterday, voters
overwhelmingly declared...

16:20.439 --> 16:22.357
...that Lois Griffin
is not the kind of person

16:22.441 --> 16:24.026
they want running their schools.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.154
Her husband, Peter Griffin,
was elected by a landslide.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.908
What a great day! I just want to say...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.620
I am so freaking wasted!

16:34.745 --> 16:35.746
[All gasping]

16:36.371 --> 16:39.374
STEWIE: [Thinking] Splendid.
How delightful to have mother back.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.251
BRIAN: I heard that.
STEWIE: Damn!

16:41.585 --> 16:45.339
Don't feel bad, Mom.
All my friends think you're hot!

16:45.547 --> 16:47.466
They can't believe I came out of you!

16:47.549 --> 16:49.343
Lois, I got a joke for you.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.095
How many losers
does it take to make me breakfast?

16:52.179 --> 16:53.889
Just one! You!

16:54.598 --> 16:57.017
I'm just kidding. French toast, please.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.854
Don't even talk to me, Peter.
You humiliated your own wife!

17:01.271 --> 17:04.691
And for what? To get that crazy
Mr. Fargas back in the classroom?

17:04.775 --> 17:06.026
Who?

17:06.109 --> 17:08.153
Peter, I cared about our schools.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.614
All you cared about
was some stupid competition.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.491
Winning was only half the battle.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.285
If you blow this chance to do something
good for our kids...

17:15.369 --> 17:16.578
...you'll be the biggest loser!

17:16.662 --> 17:17.871
Oh, yeah?

17:17.955 --> 17:21.124
Peter Griffin is no loser!
When I'm through with our schools...

17:21.208 --> 17:24.545
...our students'll be so smart
they'll be able to program their VCRs...

17:24.628 --> 17:27.339
...without spilling piping hot gravy
all over myself.

17:32.052 --> 17:36.473
This is Trisha Takanawa, here
with School Board President Peter Griffin.

17:36.932 --> 17:41.144
Mr. President, you've accomplished
so much in just a few short weeks.

17:41.520 --> 17:46.275
Thanks, Connie. I'm very excited about
our progress in revamping our schools.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.654
For starters,
we're making sex education more fun.

17:50.946 --> 17:54.199
"Vagina junction, what's your function?

17:54.283 --> 17:57.661
"Taking in sperm and spitting out babies"

17:57.744 --> 17:59.788
And our schools are the safest around...

17:59.872 --> 18:04.251
PETER: ...thanks to the hall monitor XL-K.
MONITOR: Halt! Present hall pass!

18:04.334 --> 18:07.838
STUDENT: Right here.
MONITOR: Second request. Present pass.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.800
STUDENT: But... Right here!
MONITOR: Security breach!

18:14.761 --> 18:19.391
I guess Little Miss Free Spirit will think
twice before roaming the halls.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.852
PETER: I've restocked
our school library...

18:21.935 --> 18:24.813
...with books of some
of our greatest movies and TV shows.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.232
Because if we don't teach our kids
to read,

18:27.316 --> 18:29.109
how will they ever know what's on?

18:29.193 --> 18:30.986
Mr. Griffin, this is impressive.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.281
I've never seen kids
so enthusiastic about reading.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.783
Thank you. That's what you voted for.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.578
Hey, son, show the folks at home
what you got there.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.623
Good Lord! That's a dirty magazine!

18:42.706 --> 18:44.499
That's mine... Shaft.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.044
There might be a mineshaft
under this library.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.421
All these kids are looking at pornography!

18:49.505 --> 18:51.798
TRISHA: What kind of pervert
gave you kids this filth?

18:51.882 --> 18:54.092
Chris Griffin. He got it from his dad.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.645
CLEVELAND: There's quite a crowd outside.

19:04.853 --> 19:09.775
I haven't witnessed pandemonium like this
since Ridiculous Day down at the deli...

19:09.900 --> 19:13.403
...when prices were so low
they were ridiculous.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.782
You said it, pally.
That's why I brought in the big guns.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.244
Say "how do" to the Ragin' Cajun,
Mr. James Carville.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.662
Oh, God. Oh, jeez!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.497
Did somebody open
the Ark of the Covenant?

19:23.580 --> 19:27.000
Now see, Peter, what you gotta do is
you gotta declare war! War!

19:27.084 --> 19:29.336
Your only chance
of surviving this scandal...

19:29.419 --> 19:32.089
...is to claim that Lois
gave your boy the pornography.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.300
And he's right.
Pin it on the old ball and chain.

19:35.384 --> 19:38.387
I can't do that.
Lois is mad enough at me without...

19:38.595 --> 19:40.806
I'm sorry. I can't look at you!

19:40.973 --> 19:44.434
I mean, I can handle ugly.
But this is like circus ugly.

19:45.269 --> 19:50.023
Lois, I need your help. You gotta come
to my press conference this afternoon.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.401
Lois, I could lose my presidency!

19:52.484 --> 19:55.571
Too bad! I've already lost more than that!

19:55.904 --> 19:58.365
Not my rainbow socks
with the individual toes?

19:58.448 --> 20:01.451
No. I've lost my respect for you.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.622
Because I need those socks.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.458
We now take you live
to Peter Griffin Junior High...

20:08.542 --> 20:10.544
...where embattled School Board President

20:10.627 --> 20:13.088
Peter Griffin is fighting
for his political life.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.840
CROWD: Throw the bum out!

20:15.132 --> 20:18.218
Mom, what are you doing here?
I thought you were mad at Dad.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.388
I am.
I just came to see him twist in the wind.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.891
Are you and Dad gonna get a divorce?

20:23.974 --> 20:26.476
Oh, honey. Maybe.

20:26.768 --> 20:30.397
PETER: "A parent giving porno to their kid
is a terrible thing...

20:30.814 --> 20:33.150
"...but I'm here to tell you
that I'm innocent!"

"My wife, Lois..."

20:47.497 --> 20:48.957
PETER: Lois!

20:51.168 --> 20:56.507
Crap. Look, my wife, Lois, is the most
important person in the world to me.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.843
I gave my son those magazines.

21:00.844 --> 21:05.265
Even worse, I turned a beautiful gift from
Lois into something cheap and tawdry.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.893
I just wanted to win so bad.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.854
Now I know that some things
are more important than winning.

21:10.938 --> 21:14.525
Lois, I only hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.026
LOIS: Oh, Peter!

21:20.030 --> 21:23.408
So you're saying you're not only
a bad father, but a bad husband, too?

21:23.492 --> 21:25.035
Have you the moral authority to lead?

21:25.118 --> 21:28.747
Yes. No. And, screw it. I resign.

21:29.039 --> 21:32.376
DIANE: There's the President,
First Lady Lois.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.045
TOM: Now boarding the helicopter.

21:39.341 --> 21:43.262
And so ends a dark and shameful chapter
in the history of Quahog, Rhode Island.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.430
One which leaves this reporter asking:

21:45.514 --> 21:49.810
How much moral bankruptcy and
perversion must we, the people, endure?

21:49.893 --> 21:52.563
