No, you took off before me
by approximately two seconds,

01:23.209 --> 01:27.248

both mentally and physically
prepared before you accelerated.

I’m sorry we didn’t
make the lecture.
You must be disappointed.

03:33.130 --> 03:37.590
I know how much you
wanted to hear about Sparta

03:37.676 --> 03:39.132
You wanted
to hear about what?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.506
Booth is a big fan
of the Peloponnesian War.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.680
- He was coming with me to a lecture.
- Oh, of course he was.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.849
- Why are you here?
- Dead guy.

03:46.936 --> 03:51.054
And the fact that
they’ve recovered
over $150,000 so far.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.231
Stuff like that makes
a federal prosecutor like me
all tingly.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.025
- Bullet’s made out of copper.
- Why didn’t the shooter
take all that money?

03:57.113 --> 03:59.024
He was only interested
in the kill.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.571
Plus it’s handmade.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.024
- This was Broadsky.
- Broadsky, the sniper?

04:03.119 --> 04:06.031
- Your friend who killed
the Grave Digger?
- He’s not my friend. Okay?

04:06.122 --> 04:09.239
- We were in the service together.
- The bullet severed the C5.

04:09.333 --> 04:13.326
Right. Severing the spinal cord
from the brain stem
is the gold standard for snipers.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.877
We call it
disconnecting the computer.

04:14.964 --> 04:18.502
You can never have
too many cute phrases
for taking a life.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.708
There are no other bullets around here.
It was one shot.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.919
Given the trajectory,
the bullet came from over there.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.004
It had to travel
through all that piping...

04:25.099 --> 04:27.181
and had to be precise enough
to guarantee a kill.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.847
Broadsky did this.
The ID. says the victim
was Walter Crane.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.556
- I bet this is someone
we’d both be trying to put away.
- It doesn’t matter who this was.

04:34.650 --> 04:38.188
Snipers don’t get to
make the call, and Broadsky
doesn’t get to make the call.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.146
This ends now.
Broadsky is mine.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.394
You’re abnormally
quiet today.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.899
Thank you.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.606
Usually by now, you’d have
buried me in factoids...

05:25.701 --> 05:28.317
aboutguns
and historical assassinations.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.575
Yes. For example, were you
aware, uh—

05:31.665 --> 05:34.407
Why are you pinching
your lips shut?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.834
I find that it helps
prevent me from blurting.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.833
My sponsor believes that
it’s very important...

05:39.924 --> 05:42.961
that l restrain
my compulsion to use facts...

05:43.052 --> 05:45.634
to keep people
at arm’s length emotionally...

05:45.721 --> 05:48.463
and that I should actually be having
more conversations like this,

05:52.311 --> 05:55.599
Would it help if we turned
to the case in front of us?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.346
God, yes.

05:57.441 --> 06:01.025
Cause of death
is high-velocity trauma...

06:01.111 --> 06:04.603
resulting in the severing
of the spinal cord here.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.234
Identification found
on the remains...

06:06.325 --> 06:09.488
suggests that this is a man
named Walter Crane.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.069
Walter Crane was born
and raised in Virginia.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.745
That’s correct.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.586
Look at the isotope ratios
from his bone apatite.

06:20.673 --> 06:23.415
Nitrogen levels
suggest a Midwesterner.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.875
I think we need Angela to do
the facial reconstruction.

06:25.970 --> 06:29.303
You would like to ascertain that
this man is indeed Walter Crane,

06:29.390 --> 06:31.005
a construction worker
from Virginia?

06:31.100 --> 06:33.466
It appears that these remains
and this identity...

06:33.561 --> 06:35.301
do not correspond.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.408

that’s exactly what I’m doing.

You’re one fine, fine woman.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.875
Okay, Dad, what do you want?

07:06.969 --> 07:08.709
Your firstborn child.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.922
[ Chuckles ] To a lot of people,
that would totally freak them out.

07:13.017 --> 07:18.728
I heard his name in one bad,
get-down, boogyin’ blues number.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.519
Isn’t that exactly
how you found my name?
Yes, it is. And that’s a fact.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.477
The name I hated so much that
I changed it as soon as I could?

07:25.613 --> 07:28.320
It’s still your name.
Not legally.

07:28.407 --> 07:32.525
Well, what things are
got nothin’ to do
with legal or not legal.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.111
They just are.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.948
Dad, traditionally,
the father of the child...

07:39.043 --> 07:41.034
does have some say
over the name.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.622
Well, sweetness, the child’s name
came to me in a song...

07:45.716 --> 07:49.584
between an E-seventh heaven
and A—minor genius.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.260
It was like hearing it
from the lips of God himself.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.802
All right.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.884
It’s true.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.354
I’ll tell Hodgins.

07:59.438 --> 08:04.273
Well, I guess if you feel
you gotta, then you gotta.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.653
These are the bills found
with the victim’s body.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.118
All hundreds, right?
Yes. But guess
what I found on them.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.742
Blood, on account
that he was shot to death
with a high-powered rifle?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.619
Yes, blood. Of course, blood.
But guess what else I found.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.747
- Does this look like
a guessing face?
- Right. Okay.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.588
- Sodium hypochlorite.
- Salt?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.632
- No. Bleach.
- Guy bleached his money?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.050
- Yeah.
- Why?

08:32.137 --> 08:34.879
You know who this is?

08:34.973 --> 08:36.838
Abraham Lincoln.
He’s pretty famous.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.846
But hundred-dollar bills should
feature Benjamin Franklin.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.723
- You see what happened here?
- Yeah. I get it.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.554
- These are counterfeit bills.
- I got it.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.731
The counterfeiter bleaches
five-dollar bills...

08:45.818 --> 08:47.900
and then reprints over it
with much higher denomina—

08:47.986 --> 08:51.274
Hodgins, I’m a federal agent, okay?
I know how counterfeiting works.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.697
They do that because it’s much,
much tougher to counterfeit
the paper than the printing.

08:53.784 --> 08:56.696
- Okay, yeah. I’m done.
- Dead guy’s a counterfeiter.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.620
That makes sense that Broadsky
would go after a counterfeiter.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.197
Why does that
make sense?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.452
Hey— But why?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.122
Seeley Booth!
Yeah, that’s me.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.828
I checked it out
with Witness Protection.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.705
Our victim
was in the program.
Good.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.924
Funny thing about
Witness Protection.
What’s that?

09:12.010 --> 09:15.468
It sort of comes with
a built-in motive for murder
attached, doesn’t it?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.421
That’s why
they need protection.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.507
Real name—
Walter Coolidge.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.559
Well, it makes sense
that Broadsky would go
after a guy like him.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.183
That’s right.
Broadsky goes after
bad guys.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.980
Doesn’t make him right.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.978
Of course it doesn’t
make him right.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.311
It just bleeds off a little of our motivation
to catch him right away.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.864
Coolidge flipped on Ortiz
and sent him to prison.
Is he still there?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.699
No.
Why?
Thought he had life.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.697
Ortiz isn’t
currently in prison...

09:39.788 --> 09:42.029
because he’s sitting
in your interrogation room.

09:42.166 --> 09:45.658
You’re the best.
Tell me something
I don’t know.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.331
This is nice,
getting out.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.504
It’s like a field trip.
You know?

09:50.591 --> 09:52.047
Remember him?
Sure.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.715
He did some
nice work for me.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.838
Taking your drug-stained
small bills...

09:55.929 --> 09:57.885
and giving them new life
as hundred-dollar bills?

09:57.973 --> 10:00.305
I’m offended
at the allegation.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.383
I hired Walter
as an art consultant.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.139
He testified against you.

10:04.229 --> 10:08.598
Said he saw you give the order
to have three undercover
operatives killed,

10:08.692 --> 10:12.184
- which testimony put you
where you are today.
- And look where that got him.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.235
- Where did it get him?
- Dead.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.564
- Broadsky give you some kind
of proof? A photograph?
- Come on, guys.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.944
Save yourself some pain.
I’m in for triple life.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.661
Seems you know who this guy is.
You should just go get him.
What do you need me for?

10:22.748 --> 10:25.865
I need to know
how you got in touch with him.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.540
Why would I tell you?

10:30.714 --> 10:33.046
I can arrange to
have you transferred...

10:33.133 --> 10:35.340
to a medium-security
federal penitentiary.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.338
And if you don’t,
she’ll send you to Angola.

10:37.429 --> 10:41.263
And no Internet,
which I suspect is the spicy part
of your sex life.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.341
[Chuckling]

10:45.020 --> 10:49.764
If I ever talked to this guy,
which I never did,
it’s because he called me.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.477
And if a target was suggested,
which it never was,

10:54.571 --> 10:56.823
it’s because it came from him,
not from me.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.865
- What was the price?
- Money doesn’t mean much
to me in prison. I forget.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.738
He’s gonna do this again.
You know that.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.821
- Somebody else is gonna die.
- I understand.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.907
Someone as skilled
as your sniper
likes to ply his trade.

11:10.379 --> 11:14.167
I wish I knew more,
but all I did was answer the phone.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.250
Now, when will I be
moving to California?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.086
- Did I say California?
- No.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.216
[ Brennan ]
Why does it
make sense to you...

11:26.311 --> 11:27.892
that Broadsky killed
a counterfeiter?

11:27.980 --> 11:29.686
Counterfeiters
are bad guys.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.389
Look at Broadsky’s victims.
I mean, they’re all people
who got away with somethin’.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.315
Who cares about
his twisted motives?

11:34.403 --> 11:35.734
The question is,

11:35.821 --> 11:37.937
how did Broadsky even know
where to find Coolidge?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.942
He was supposed to be
in Witness Protection.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.490
Okay, if Broadsky
has an inside man
at the US. Marshal’s office,

11:42.578 --> 11:44.864
he’d definitely be able
to track down Coolidge
or the Grave Digger.

11:44.955 --> 11:48.038
But you said
that Broadsky works alone.
Isn’t that what snipers do?

11:48.125 --> 11:51.743
Wow. You’re really—
You’re gonna say it like that?
Not all snipers are the same.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.586
lam not him.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.627
Nothing I said
made any such allusion.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.835
Okay, okay, kids.
Let’s take a breath.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.636
There are only 18 marshals
in the DC. office.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.467
I’ll have their files pulled,
and we’ll see if any of ‘em
have a connection to Broadsky.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.142
[ Booth ]
Right.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.975
This is just what happens,
Hodgins.

12:13.108 --> 12:16.521
He picks the baby’s name.
It’s a family tradition.
And you’re okay with that?

12:16.612 --> 12:18.148

think about it.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.980
But it’s—
it’s our kid, Ange. Ours.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.690
And he’s my dad.
He’s our dad now.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.777

that is so terrible
you had to change it.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.784

I would not fight him on this.

and you can’t win.

what name he’s chosen.
You might love it.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.208

that we should wait
and hear what it is?

12:41.303 --> 12:43.965

you and your father.

- Hey, mind if I join you?

I actually have
a question for you.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.435
Oh, great. Shoot.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.104

I should use during
a murder investigation.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.228

Anyway, Angela’s father—

some interpersonal
family question, or—

it’s complicated, of course,

he was unconscious, Angela.

I don’t know if that would
be a really good idea,

15:41.817 --> 15:43.728
‘cause the information you
have provided Mr. Broadsky...

15:43.819 --> 15:47.232
has resulted in the death
of at least three people.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.234

- You owe him your life.

no one else would be hurt.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.008

Ashwaldt said that Broadsky’s
been using her cabin
because he likes to hunt.

keep doin’ this.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.791
Your words
are quite ironic.
What do you mean?

17:24.878 --> 17:28.791
I imagine Broadsky
would say the same thing
as he stalks his prey.

are such subjective concepts,

17:42.062 --> 17:44.178
how could you ever be sure
you were doing the right thing?

17:44.272 --> 17:47.184
Okay, well, it’s not subjective to me.
There’s good and there’s evil.

as target practice.

that this deer was killed

23:58.229 --> 23:59.969
Yeah. Looks like it.

24:00.064 --> 24:03.101
Although it’s big.
.110 caliber, minimum.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.774
Any larger and we’d have
to call this thing a shell.

24:05.862 --> 24:09.605
How does a single bullet
fragment into 154 fragments?

24:09.699 --> 24:13.442
Well, at first I thought that
it must’ve been a ricochet.
But look at the tip.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.910
There’s no sign
of impact.
Right.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.454
So, what kind of bullet
fragments...

24:18.541 --> 24:20.327
before it hits anything?

24:21.836 --> 24:23.542
What’s this?
It appears to be
the remnants...

24:23.630 --> 24:26.372
from some kind of circuitry
that Vincent dug out
of the deer meat.

24:27.508 --> 24:30.215
What if the circuitry
is part of the bullet?

24:31.846 --> 24:34.633
I mean,
this is a computer chip.
You can program it.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.090
Which suggests
you could program the bullet.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.801
Yeah, which means we’re
looking at something
from the future.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.682
Time travel
is physically impossible.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.981
Yeah, but so is a bullet
that you can program
like a computer.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.060
Like we didn’t
have it bad enough
with the old kind.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.295
Agent Booth.
Is this a bad time?

25:08.383 --> 25:09.873
No, no. Come in.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.801
Look, I don’t want you to think
l have a problem here. Okay?

25:13.888 --> 25:16.345
- Okay.
- I just need to
talk some things out.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.014
Because I’m starting to
talk to myself and I’m
sounding like a loon.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.013
Sure. Have a seat.

25:21.104 --> 25:24.187
It’s this whole thing
with, uh, Broadsky.

25:24.273 --> 25:29.017
Bones keeps, uh, equating me
with him because, you know—

25:29.112 --> 25:33.151
‘cause we were snipers
and, you know,
we’re the same.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.526
Mm-hmm.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.450
Hey, you’re supposed to say,
“No, you’re not the same.”

25:37.537 --> 25:40.074
Do you actually think
| view you and Broadsky
the same way?

25:40.164 --> 25:43.031
I never wanted to pull the trigger.
Do you understand me?

25:43.126 --> 25:46.835
It was a war. It was a necessity.
That was my responsibility.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.082
- I understand.
- It was a terrible act
for the greater good.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.834
Why does Bones
question that?

25:50.925 --> 25:53.507
Does she really,
or are you questioning it?

25:53.636 --> 25:57.470
Why are you asking me questions?
Didn’t I say I wanted to come in
and talk some things out?

25:57.557 --> 25:59.422
Just hear me out
for a second here!

25:59.559 --> 26:01.265
Okay.
[ Exhales ]

26:01.978 --> 26:04.094
I don’t get it.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.179
Broadsky
was a good man.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.481
I don’t understand
what happened to him.

26:08.568 --> 26:13.187
I mean, what gives him the right
to make these kind of calls?

26:17.660 --> 26:20.402
- Would you like me
to answer that?
- Sure. I would love an answer.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.621
Yeah.
That’s why I’m here.
[ Clears Throat]

26:25.793 --> 26:27.909
Being the cause
of someone’s death,

26:28.004 --> 26:30.086
no matter
what the circumstances,

26:30.173 --> 26:32.255
leaves a man
with a great burden.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.878
People deal with that burden
in different ways.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.881
You know, some—
some celebrate it.

26:37.972 --> 26:41.214
They relish the power
as a way of justifying
what they’ve done.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.016
Others, like Broadsky,
they justify another way.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.266
They feel that it’s their destiny
to mete out justice.

26:47.356 --> 26:51.850
They convince themselves
that they have the moral
high ground to make these calls.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.651
It’s the only way they can live
with what they’ve done.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.484
What about me?

27:01.283 --> 27:01.370
From my perspective,
you’re a healthy man.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.235
You can accept
what you’ve done...

27:03.331 --> 27:07.449
and the pain and sadness
and regret that comes with it.

27:07.543 --> 27:12.003
You know, not everybody
has the strength
to deal with that reality.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.377
It’s a testament to you
that you’ve built this life...

27:15.468 --> 27:19.302
with family and friends
who love and respect you.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.720
Booth, that can’t be easy.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.476
It kills me that Bones thinks...

27:27.563 --> 27:30.396
that taking someone’s life
means nothing to me.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.482
Have you talked to her
about it?

27:33.569 --> 27:34.979
We don’t go there
anymore.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.777
- That’s over.
- Okay.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.571
You gotta get back to work,
and l have to get back to work too.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.240
If you need me again,
Booth—

27:41.327 --> 27:43.318
Thanks, really.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.403
I got what I needed.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.000
Okay, so I got
this demo from
the Department of Defense.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.377
This has to be the bullet
that Broadsky used.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.174
It’s called a smart bullet.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.547
More like a bomb.

28:00.638 --> 28:02.174
Well,
essentially it is.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.426
lt matches the damage
to the deer’s skull.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.348
The rifle is an AM-40.

28:06.435 --> 28:09.051
You set the distance you want
the bullet to detonate.

28:09.146 --> 28:12.183
I’m sorry. Why would
anyone want a bullet
to explode in midair?

28:12.275 --> 28:13.765
Well, here’s why.

28:17.989 --> 28:21.732
The rifle is perfect
for fighting insurgents
in Afghanistan.

28:21.826 --> 28:25.068
That’s how he managed
the impossible shot
on the practice range...

28:25.162 --> 28:28.450
and why he built walls
in the middle of a field.

28:28.541 --> 28:31.248
Broadsky’s next target
must be in a location
that’s difficult to access,

28:31.335 --> 28:32.871
othenNise he wouldn’t
need this weapon.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.668
There’s one
little problem.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.667
This bullet has a diameter
of 25 millimeters.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.467
The diameter of
the bullet we recovered
is 20 millimeters.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.091
And the circuitry we found
was custom-made.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.923
You mean Broadsky
made the weapon himself?

28:47.018 --> 28:49.475
Booth says it’s too sophisticated,
even for Broadsky.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.607
Glad you could stop by.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.438
I’m sure you are.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.444
So, about the baby’s name.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.820
Right.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.198
It came to me
during a song.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.200
Can’t be more perfect
than that, can it?

29:10.291 --> 29:15.536
I’m sure it must be
very meaningful... for you.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.746
This is what Angie wants,
you know.

29:17.840 --> 29:23.551
Well, |— I know that
this is, you know, what, uh—
what you want Angie to want.

29:23.638 --> 29:26.300
And since she loves you,
she wants it.

29:26.390 --> 29:30.724
And since I love her,
I’m trying to—
to want it too...

29:30.811 --> 29:32.517
because I want
to make her happy.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.596
Well, that’s probably
good enough.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.397
So, the name
that came to you—

29:37.485 --> 29:41.148
It could work for either a boy or a girl.
That’s the beauty part.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.853

Great.

see that one coming.

what it means?

No. No. That’s okay.

Because it’s not
gonna happen.

Now look, you can— you can
attack me with dogs. Okay?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.384
You can burn me
with a branding iron.

listen to a musical. I don’t care.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.268
Actually,
I’m more of an arms maker.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.192
Oh, and did you make
a smart bullet prototype
for Jacob Broadsky?

31:03.279 --> 31:05.645
In my line of work,
discretion is paramount.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.197
- Discretion can also be
an accessory to murder.

I can’t be charged for
simply selling ammunition.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.320
Well, you see, cher,
I am the law,

31:14.415 --> 31:17.327

your scrawny ass

I like the challenge.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.914

Do you remember when
you and Jacob were first
deployed to Iraq...

31:24.133 --> 31:27.045
and the army didn’t have
enough body armor
for its soldiers?

31:27.136 --> 31:31.254
The Kevlar vest I made you—
how many rounds did that absorb?

31:31.348 --> 31:34.306
- We’re not talking about that now.
- I believe it was three.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.304
A thank you card
would’ve been nice.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.226
The problem is,
Broadsky’s not active military.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.896
He’s on loan-out
for a special assignment.

31:40.983 --> 31:43.725
Yeah, I did my due diligence.
I saw the papenNork.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.901
He probably could’ve shown you
phony passports too.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.354
You’d accept anything that
could make you a little money.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.986
Now it’s a crime to be
a capitalist in America?

31:51.077 --> 31:53.739

so far. Three.

31:53.829 --> 31:58.163

a lot more than that
if memory serves.

were the specs I needed
to design the bullet.

Which were?

Draw!

32:26.362 --> 32:27.898

and a marble floor...

32:36.455 --> 32:39.447
and a ceiling 12 feet high
made of copper.

32:39.542 --> 32:43.251
It has a window on this wall,
1-by-4 feet.

The bottom sill,
eight feet off the floor.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.837
Where did he pick up
the bullets?
He didn’t.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.836
I dropped them off in a locker
at the bus station.

32:49.927 --> 32:52.714
- When?
- He said he needed them by today.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.972
That doesn’t give us
much time, che’ri

of the room...

32:59.395 --> 33:03.013
and cross-referenced them
with architectural plans
on file with DC.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.060
There have to be
tens of thousands.
Yeah.

33:07.403 --> 33:11.863
it narrows down to
a building that had to be
constructed before 1939.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.280
Wait a minute.

33:13.367 --> 33:18.077
Marble, copper ceiling,
before 1939.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.906
Yeah. The parameters
are all in there.

Bones, what do you think?
It fits
the measurements exactly.

33:46.275 --> 33:49.517

are both marble.
The ceiling is copper.

Right. 80, this bathroom
serves two courtrooms.

33:53.991 --> 33:56.152
Shouldn’t we evacuate
the building?
No.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.110
If we do that, Broadsky—
he’s just gonna take off,
wait for another chance.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.032
Snipers are patient.
Like you.

34:01.123 --> 34:04.286
Right now we know the where.
We pretty much know the when.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.991
We just gotta
figure out the who.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.826
We can look through
the dockets...

34:07.963 --> 34:10.124
and identify possible targets
using Sweets’s profile.

your thing yet?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.219
I’ve got the courthouse,

34:14.303 --> 34:17.716

the elevation and distance
of Broadsky’s practice shot.

looking for it now.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.349
Okay, got it.

There is one location
that matches the practice shot.

so you can kill Broadsky...

35:03.310 --> 35:05.642
or because it’s
the best way to stop him?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.265
It’s the only way.

35:07.356 --> 35:11.520
You gotta trust me on this one,
trust that I’m gonna do the right thing.

if we see anything.

35:42.182 --> 35:45.595
The answer’s still no,
and tell her to stop asking.
Booth says stop asking.

35:45.686 --> 35:49.099
I don’t wait well.
I’m an action person.
Waiting makes my teeth hurt.

35:49.189 --> 35:52.272
- Her teeth hurt.
- Okay.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.153
Nothing. Maybe we’re
in the wrong place.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.650
Or the wrong time.

35:59.742 --> 36:03.485
- Maybe Angela got it wrong.
- Or Broadsky saw us?

36:03.579 --> 36:05.160
No, I doubt that.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.989
Well, the courtrooms
are both clear now.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.120
Nothing here
except for a few lawyers
and bailiffs, like that.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.460
The courtrooms
are clear now.
No defendants?

36:13.547 --> 36:16.334
[Brennan]
No defendants?
No female defendants.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.336
There’s a female
defense attorney.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.167
There’s a female
defense attorney.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.254
Any high-profile cases?
Did she set
some psycho free?

36:23.390 --> 36:27.053
Any high-proﬂie cases?
No, she’s just some lackey
from a big firm.

36:27.144 --> 36:29.226
This is the first case
she’s handling alone.

36:29.355 --> 36:32.688
She’s no one important.
Who is she defending?
I mean, what did he do?

36:32.775 --> 36:34.766
[Brennan]
Who is she defending?

36:35.944 --> 36:39.687
Um, Gregory Allen.
Corrupt cop.

36:39.782 --> 36:42.615
Charged with bribery,
accessory to murder.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.862
Looks to me like he’s
looking to plead out.

36:44.953 --> 36:48.411
A bad cop named Allen.
Bribery and murder charges.

36:48.499 --> 36:50.330
Can we just put her
on speakerphone?

36:50.417 --> 36:54.035
- What’s the story?
- Says here he took a bribe...

36:54.129 --> 36:56.290
not to arrest
a hit-and-run driver...

36:56.382 --> 36:58.543
who killed a woman
and two kids.

36:58.634 --> 37:00.215
That sounds like
Broadsky’s target.

37:00.302 --> 37:05.217
Why would Broadsky
focus on the women’s bathroom
if his target is a man?

37:06.934 --> 37:09.095
- Booth?
- Yeah.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.097
Architecture is often
much like the human body.

37:11.188 --> 37:14.351
- What are you getting at?
- There’s a certain symmetry—
anterior, posterior.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.523
- There’s a mirror image.
- Of course.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.352
The men’s bathroom looks
just like the women’s bathroom.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.573

Caroline, the target
is the men’s bathroom.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.780
We’re going
to the other side
of the building.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.501
There he is.
I got Broadsky.

37:42.970 --> 37:45.928
He’s definitely going after the cop.
I’m gonna need you to be my spotter.

37:46.056 --> 37:49.423
No, I’m not trained
for that type of work.
Come on. You’re brilliant.

37:49.518 --> 37:54.012
Just pick up the range finder,
look through it, find Broadsky
and just give me a read.

is on the move,

Wind speed here.
I feel it on my cheek.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.950
I estimate five miles per hour,
coming from the south.

38:13.041 --> 38:17.034
I need wind velocity
on Broadsky there.
You see a flag? Anything?

I don’t see anything.
