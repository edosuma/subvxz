00:47.781 --> 00:50.318
CAN YOU FEEL IT, BABY?
- THE DANCING.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.587
- THE PARADE.
- THE FUCKING.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.423
- AH.
OH, CAN'T WAIT.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.424
- YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR IT?

00:56.457 --> 00:58.092
- HE'S UP FOR IT.

00:58.126 --> 01:02.396
- IT'S MY FIRST PRIDE.
- CAREFUL. PRIDE IS A SIN.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.299
- THEN I'M GOING TO HELL.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.768
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.704
- DON'T EVEN
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.274
- [chuckling]
WHO DID THIS?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.608
- SOME DEMENTED QUEEN...

01:14.642 --> 01:15.609
- OH, MY GOD.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.678
- WITH NO TASTE.
- NICE JOB, MA.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.313
- GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.149
- OKAY, CAN WE HURRY UP
AND EAT, PLEASE?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.451
I'VE GOT APPOINTMENTS
ALL DAY.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.618
- YOU'VE GOT APPOINTMENTS?

01:24.652 --> 01:26.354
- IT'S PRIDE, HONEY.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.389
FACIAL AT 9:00,
PEDICURE AT 10:00,

01:28.422 --> 01:29.857
BIKINI WAX...

01:29.890 --> 01:31.325
AT 11:00.
- [shudders]

01:31.359 --> 01:32.860
- OH, THEN I'VE GOT
TO TAKE GODIVA HER DRESS.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.462
- HERE YOU GO.
- SHE'S MARCHING?

01:34.495 --> 01:36.264
- NO, I'M PUSHING.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.532
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
ACCESSORIZE A WHEELCHAIR.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.501
- WHO'S GODIVA?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.203
- "WHO'S GODIVA?"

01:42.236 --> 01:45.206
DON'T THEY TEACH
YOU FUCKING KIDS ANYTHING?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.808
TIME FOR GAY HISTORY 101.
- OKAY.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.643
- LET ME TELL YOU,

01:49.677 --> 01:53.714
GODIVA IS THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DRAG QUEEN.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.316
- AT LEAST PITTSBURGH'S.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.251
- [chuckles]
- I HAD, UH...

01:57.285 --> 01:59.220
I HAD JUST MOVED HERE FROM
MISSISSIPPI, DIDN'T KNOW A SOUL.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.223
SOMEHOW,
I FOUND MY WAY TO WOODY'S.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.425
I WAS STANDING THERE,
SHE COMES UP TO ME,

02:04.458 --> 02:07.628
AND, UH, AND SAYS,
"YOU ALL ALONE, SUGAR?"

02:07.661 --> 02:11.699
I STOOD THERE WITH MY MOUTH
HANGING OPEN.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.167
- WELL, THINGS
HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.635
- OUCH.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.471
- "WELL, NOT ANYMORE,"
SHE SAID.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.908
"NOW YOU'VE GOT GODIVA,
JUST LIKE THE CHOCOLATE:

02:20.941 --> 02:22.643
DARK AND SWEET!"

02:22.676 --> 02:23.711
SHE INTRODUCED ME
TO EVERYONE

02:23.744 --> 02:25.479
AND EVERYTHING...

02:25.513 --> 02:30.384
INCLUDING MY FIRST PRIDE.

02:30.418 --> 02:35.223
I'M AFRAID
THIS MAY BE HER LAST.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.292
- IF YOU ASK ME, PEOPLE MAKE
TOO MUCH OF THIS PRIDE BUSINESS.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.893
- AS IF YOU'D EVEN KNOW,

02:39.927 --> 02:41.295
CONSIDERING YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN TO ONE.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.730
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN?

02:42.763 --> 02:43.831
- POOR MIKEY'S AFRAID

02:43.864 --> 02:45.466
HE'LL END UP
AS THE TOKEN PRIDE CLIP

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
ON THE 6:00 NEWS.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.402
- WELL, I DON'T EXACTLY
SEE YOU OUT THERE

02:48.436 --> 02:49.870
BEING THE...
GRAND MARSHAL.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.540
- WE ALL HAVE OUR WAYS
OF CELEBRATING.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.408
SOME PEOPLE TAKE IT
TO THE STREETS...

02:54.442 --> 02:56.277
- OTHER PEOPLE
TAKE IT TO THE SHEETS.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.311
- WHA...

02:57.345 --> 02:59.313
- [chuckling]

02:59.347 --> 03:00.914
- SO, LOVE MUFFINS?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.916
YOU READY
FOR THE HIGH HOMO HOLIDAYS?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.818
- YES.
- ABSOLUTELY.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.954
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MADAM PFLAG PRESIDENT?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.756
- WE HAVE
THE BIGGEST GROUP YET.

03:08.789 --> 03:09.590
- CONGRATULATIONS.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.692
- THANK YOU.
- NOW IF ONLY YOUR...

03:11.725 --> 03:14.628
WITTLE PWIDE AND JOY
WOULD MARCH WIF YOU.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.398
- ORDER SOME PANCAKES
AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.799
- NOTHING WOULD
MAKE ME PROUDER.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.835
BUT I'M NOT
A MANIPULATIVE...

03:21.869 --> 03:24.938
GUILT-SLINGING
KIND OF MOTHER.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.741
MICHAEL CAN DO
WHAT HE WANTS.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.381
[voice breaking]
SO WHAT'LL YOU HAVE...

03:33.414 --> 03:35.283
LITTLE ASSHOLE?

03:35.316 --> 03:37.785
- [sighs]

03:44.292 --> 03:45.493
I'LL HAVE THE MARCH
AND THE PARADE.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.860
HOLD THE TEARS.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.629
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.664
- I SAID I'LL MARCH, OKAY?

03:50.698 --> 03:51.665
- [shrieks]

03:51.699 --> 03:52.866
- PFF!
- OH, JEEZ!

03:52.900 --> 03:55.636
- HEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT,
EVERYBODY?

03:55.669 --> 03:59.473
MY--MY KID'S GONNA MARCH
WITH ME IN THE PARADE!

03:59.507 --> 04:02.310
[patrons clapping, cheering]
- CONGRATULATIONS.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.912
- OH, HAPPY DAY.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.485
- GRAPE?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.821
AHH!

04:13.854 --> 04:18.258
[moaning]

04:22.062 --> 04:25.499
MMM, MY OTHER CLIENTS
AREN'T NEARLY AS COOPERATIVE.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.535
- THEY'D BETTER NOT BE.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.637
- [giggles]

04:29.670 --> 04:30.438
AH.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.806
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT?
- MMM.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.642
JUST ENOUGH...

04:34.675 --> 04:36.810
FOR...

04:36.844 --> 04:38.946
THIS.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.047
[both sigh]

04:40.080 --> 04:41.782
- WE HAVE TO SIGN ALL THIS?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.817
- WELL, WE HAVE
DURABLE POWERS OF ATTORNEY

04:43.851 --> 04:45.486
AND LIVING WILL,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.555
JOINT TENANCY AGREEMENT,

04:47.588 --> 04:49.590
RECIPROCAL GUARDIANSHIP
FOR GUS...

04:49.623 --> 04:52.926
- AFTER THIS, SIGNING A MARRIAGE
LICENSE WOULD BE A BREEZE.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.429
- THAT IS WHAT YOU WANTED,
ISN'T IT?

04:55.463 --> 04:58.832
- MMM.
DAMN RIGHT.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.501
YOU AND ME.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
SIGNED...

05:01.935 --> 05:03.837
SEALED...

05:03.871 --> 05:06.374
AND DELIVERED.
MM!

05:06.407 --> 05:08.542
[both moaning]

05:08.576 --> 05:11.345
- [clears throat]
SORRY.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.080
- IS GUS TAKING HIS NAP?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.516
- UH, NO,
BUT I COULD SURE USE ONE.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.017
AH, YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.819
- MY 2:00?
I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT HERE.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.388
- YEAH, WELL YOU TRY
TELLING THAT TO--

05:20.421 --> 05:21.989
- OUT OF THE WAY,
CHICKEN LEGS.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.492
WHERE IS THAT SEXY BEAST?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.560
[both scream]

05:26.594 --> 05:30.831
[laughing]

05:30.864 --> 05:33.434
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
SHE'D PRACTICALLY SHIT?

05:33.467 --> 05:34.702
- YOU CERTAINLY DID.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.504
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.572
- THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS
WHEN YOU'RE IN PITTSBURGH!

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
- YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.910
- WHY TAMPER
WITH PERFECTION, BABY?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.679
[both chuckle]

05:45.713 --> 05:47.981
- THIS IS LINDSAY.

05:48.015 --> 05:48.982
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.952
- AND THIS MUST BE LEDA.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.621
- YEAH.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.456
OOH!

05:55.489 --> 05:57.057
- MMM!

05:57.090 --> 05:59.460
[both laugh]

06:04.432 --> 06:08.469
- PERFORMANCE
OF OUR NEW POOLSIDE COOLERS...

06:08.502 --> 06:11.439
ISN'T WHAT WE'D HOPED FOR.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.641
- UNLESS YOU HOPED
FOR LESS THAN 1% OF THE MARKET.

06:13.674 --> 06:18.479
- WELL, WE NEED TO...
CHANGE OUR IMAGE.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.415
WHEN WOMEN THINK POOLSIDE,
THEY SHOULD THINK,

06:21.449 --> 06:22.750
"COOL,"

06:22.783 --> 06:23.751
"HIP,"

06:23.784 --> 06:25.018
"TRENDY."

06:25.052 --> 06:27.154
THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN

06:27.187 --> 06:29.523
ADD SOME SPUNK
TO OUR CAMPAIGN.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.459
- WELL, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR SPUNK,

06:31.492 --> 06:34.194
MR. POOLE, YOU'VE DEFINITELY
COME TO THE RIGHT MAN.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.630
- THERE'LL ALSO
BE A $50,000 BONUS

06:36.664 --> 06:38.031
IF WE CAN DOUBLE
OUR MARKET SHARE.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.469
SO, UH, GIVE ME
A PROPOSAL,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.170
AND I'LL CONSIDER IT.

06:43.203 --> 06:47.040
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER THIS, MR. POOLE.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.909
YOUR STOCK TOOK A NOSE DIVE
LAST QUARTER,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.044
AND YOU HAVE A SHAREHOLDERS
MEETING IN THREE DAYS.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.514
UNLESS YOU COME UP
WITH SOMETHING FAST,

06:53.547 --> 06:54.782
YOUR LITTLE FAMILY BUSINESS

06:54.815 --> 06:56.116
WILL BE BOUGHT OUT
FROM UNDER YOU

06:56.149 --> 06:57.818
AT 10Â¢ ON THE DOLLAR.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.821
- YOU'RE VERY BLUNT,
MR. KINNEY.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.756
- AND...

07:02.790 --> 07:04.592
YOU'RE OUT OF TIME,
MR. POOLE.

07:04.625 --> 07:09.096
IF YOU WANT ME, HIRE ME.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.230
[door opens]

07:10.263 --> 07:12.466
- THAT WAS
FUCKING BRILLIANT.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.534
- GLITTER AND SHINE.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.837
- TOO BAD YOU'RE WASTING IT
ON SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.806
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD OF CLAYTON POOLE.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.807
- THE GUY WHO...

07:19.840 --> 07:21.542
- HATES GAYS.
- RIGHT.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.544
HE'S ALWAYS DONATING HIS MONEY
TO WORTHY CAUSES,

07:23.577 --> 07:24.945
LIKE
"CASTRATE HOMOSEXUALS NOW,"

07:24.978 --> 07:26.947
"LAUNCH LESBIANS
INTO SPACE,"

07:26.980 --> 07:29.116
"STOP AIDS WITH GUNS."

07:29.149 --> 07:31.719
WELL, NOW, HE CAN DONATE
SOME OF HIS MONEY TO ME.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.787
50 GRAND.
- OHH.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.690
SO WHAT'S THE BIG CONCEPT?

07:36.724 --> 07:37.925
- FUCK IF I KNOW.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.227
- THERE WE WERE
ON OUR MOTORCYCLES...

07:40.260 --> 07:42.730
- JUST SOUTH OF BIG SUR
ON THE COAST HIGHWAY...

07:42.763 --> 07:44.197
- WHEN THIS COP
PULLED US OVER.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.833
- WELL, FOR WHAT?

07:45.866 --> 07:47.901
- SPEEDING. TOPLESS.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.537
- [laughs]

07:49.570 --> 07:50.504
- DID HE GIVE YOU A TICKET?

07:50.538 --> 07:51.772
- WELL, HE TRIED TO GIVE US
MORE THAN THAT.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.140
- HE SAID THE SIGHT OF US

07:53.173 --> 07:55.543
WAS GOING TO CAUSE SOMEONE
TO DRIVE OFF A CLIFF,

07:55.576 --> 07:56.977
THAT HE WAS
GOING TO ARREST US.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.245
- BUT THEN YOU STARTED
FLIRTING WITH HIM.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.714
- NO, NO, MY DEAR,
IT WAS YOU.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.083
- LONG STORY SHORT,
WE'RE BEHIND A ROCK,

08:03.116 --> 08:04.752
HE'S GOT HIS PANTS DOWN...

08:04.785 --> 08:06.587
- AND THIS LITTLE VIXEN
STEALS HIS BOOTS,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.121
AND WE TEAR THE FUCK
OUT OF THERE.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.122
[both laugh]

08:09.156 --> 08:10.791
- WANT SOME MORE WINE?

08:10.824 --> 08:13.026
- YEAH, YEAH.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.529
- SO HOW LONG
ARE YOU IN TOWN FOR?

08:15.563 --> 08:17.731
- TILL THEY KICK ME OUT
OR MY PHOTO EXHIBIT OPENS,

08:17.765 --> 08:19.266
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.901
- LINDSAY'S AN ARTIST TOO,
YOU KNOW.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.003
- ART TEACHER.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.238
- AND HERE I WAS THINKING
WE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.240
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.242
I THINK IT'S GROOVY,
TWO CHICKS RAISING A KID.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.612
BUT TO GO
FROM ZOOMING DOWN THE HIGHWAY

08:31.645 --> 08:34.081
TO ZERO
IN THE SLOW LANE...

08:34.114 --> 08:36.149
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT,
YOU GONNA GET MARRIED?

08:36.183 --> 08:39.152
- ACTUALLY, WE ARE.

08:39.186 --> 08:43.023
- NO SHIT.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.026
GIRL, YOU REALLY HAVE
GONE RESPECTABLE.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.164
- SO BIG WEEKEND
COMING UP, HUH?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.766
- HUH?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.234
OH, PRIDE.
YEAH.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.603
- YOU GOING?

08:55.636 --> 08:56.870
- NOT ONLY AM I GOING,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.338
I'M MARCHING
WITH MY MOTHER'S PFLAG GROUP.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.674
- YOU DON'T SOUND
VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.809
- WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

09:01.842 --> 09:03.276
A LITTLE WORRIED THAT SOMEBODY
FROM WORK MIGHT SEE ME.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.294
- DON'T WORRY.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.928
SOME WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED
TO STRETCH MARKS.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.531
- [laughs]
I DO NOT HAVE STRETCH MARKS!

19:58.565 --> 19:59.966
[grunting]

19:59.999 --> 20:01.601
STOP IT!
[giggling]

20:01.634 --> 20:03.303
- [chuckles]

20:03.336 --> 20:05.572
I DO NOT HAVE STRETCH MARKS!
OW!

20:05.605 --> 20:08.608
- [laughs]

20:11.778 --> 20:15.648
- THANKS.

20:15.682 --> 20:20.487
- OH.
DON'T FORGET THESE.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.255
[door slides]

20:22.289 --> 20:25.024
- PAYING FOR IT NOW?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.894
I SUPPOSE OLDER GENTLEMEN
HAVE TO DO THAT.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.529
- [chuckles]

20:29.562 --> 20:31.298
I KNOW THIS MAY BE
HARDER TO SWALLOW

20:31.331 --> 20:32.899
THAN HIS 10-INCH DICK,
BUT...

20:32.932 --> 20:34.000
- OOH.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.536
- "POOLSIDE"

20:36.569 --> 20:38.771
HAS JUST BECOME "POOL BOY."

20:38.805 --> 20:40.006
- OH, I HATE THAT SHIT.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.909
- EVERYBODY DOES.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.478
BUT ONCE THE FAGS
SEE THIS LABEL,

20:45.512 --> 20:48.481
THEY'LL WANT TO LAP HIM UP.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.351
- POOLE BEVERAGES?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.820
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THAT GUY IS?

20:53.853 --> 20:57.290
- YEAH.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.291
SO?

20:58.325 --> 20:59.826
- SO?

20:59.859 --> 21:00.827
HE HATES US.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.396
- WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS MONEY
IS HIS BUSINESS.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.765
- EXCEPT WHEN IT HURTS US,
THEN IT'S OUR BUSINESS.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.868
- THAT IS MY BUSINESS.

21:13.072 --> 21:16.275
- SHE WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT PRIDE.

21:18.077 --> 21:22.349
SHE SAID, "HONEY, IF I HAVE
TO WHEEL MYSELF OUT THERE

21:22.382 --> 21:26.653
ON A BOARD LIKE
PORGY AND BESS, I'M GOIN'."

21:28.688 --> 21:32.325
SHE WANTED HER HAIR
TO BE THE BIGGEST,

21:32.359 --> 21:37.296
HER GOWN
TO BE THE GLITTERIEST...

21:39.031 --> 21:39.999
JUST, UH...

21:40.032 --> 21:42.769
JUST SO EVERYONE WOULD...

21:42.802 --> 21:43.770
WOULD KNOW THAT NOTHING,

21:43.803 --> 21:46.906
NOT EVEN AIDS...

21:46.939 --> 21:51.478
COULD KEEP HER DOWN.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.880
NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME
WITHOUT HER.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.915
- UNLESS...

21:55.948 --> 21:58.818
- UNLESS?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.653
- UNLESS YOU WORE IT.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.556
- [chuckles]

22:03.590 --> 22:04.857
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.726
- MM.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.595
HONEY, I COULDN'T
FILL HER BRA,

22:08.628 --> 22:10.963
MUCH LESS HER SHOES.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.970
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I STAYED WITH HER

22:18.004 --> 22:21.441
A LITTLE WHILE?

22:24.811 --> 22:28.014
[door opens, closes]

22:31.518 --> 22:34.487
- AH, THAT'S GOOD.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.056
- DON'T GO TOO FAST, NOW.

22:40.627 --> 22:45.398
- JUSTIN!

22:45.432 --> 22:46.799
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:46.833 --> 22:50.503
- HAVING A BLAST.
TIME OF MY LIFE.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.938
MY 500 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.907
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.909
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
GOT AIDS?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.077
- NO.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.613
- YOU WILL,
SOONER OR LATER.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.583
ALL YOU FAGS
END UP HERE.

23:09.556 --> 23:14.026
- OKAY.
LET'S GIVE THIS BITCH A WHIRL!

23:14.060 --> 23:15.027
[kick-starts engine]

23:15.061 --> 23:16.829
- [coughing]
- WHOO!

23:16.863 --> 23:20.567
- [chuckles]
IT WORKS!

23:20.600 --> 23:21.601
HOP ON.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.669
- WHAT?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.771
- GRAB A HELMET.
COME WITH ME.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.541
- SOME OTHER TIME.
- HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

23:30.076 --> 23:33.179
- I THOUGHT WE'RE MARCHING
WITH THE MARRIAGE INITIATIVE.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.146
- IT'S A PARADE.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.015
DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
SO FUCKING CORRECT?

23:36.048 --> 23:37.917
CAN'T WE HAVE
A LITTLE FUN FOR A CHANGE?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.486
- WITH LEDA?

23:39.519 --> 23:41.220
- YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
LEDA'S FUN.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.155
- AND SHE'S ALSO YOUR EX,
AND I'M YOUR PARTNER.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.891
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT US.

23:44.924 --> 23:45.825
- AND WHEN DON'T I?

23:45.858 --> 23:47.527
DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE MEL AND LINZ?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.128
- WE ARE MEL AND LINZ.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.497
AND I HAPPEN
TO LIKE THAT QUITE A BIT.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.631
I THOUGHT YOU DID TOO.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.533
- OH, FOR CHRIST SAKES.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRY AND...

23:53.566 --> 23:54.734
- MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY?

23:54.767 --> 23:55.868
GO ON.

23:55.902 --> 23:59.038
GO RIDE YOUR BITCH
WITH THE GIRLS.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.111
[engine revs]

24:09.749 --> 24:12.719
[dance music plays]

24:12.752 --> 24:14.220
- HUH.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.223
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE MY MARKETING
SAMPLE'S A BIG SUCCESS.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.224
- [coughs]

24:18.257 --> 24:19.726
YEAH, AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO

24:19.759 --> 24:21.694
WAS PUT A GUY IN A SWIMSUIT
ON THE LABEL.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.095
- DON'T THESE PEOPLE
HAVE ANY TASTE?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.997
- AFTER WHERE THEIR TONGUES
HAVE BEEN?

24:25.031 --> 24:27.967
NEVER FEAR. THEY ALSO HAVE
NO MEMORY OR BRAND LOYALTY.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.268
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

24:29.301 --> 24:31.037
POOL BOY WILL BE FORGOTTEN
LIKE A BAD FUCK.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.739
- HMM.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.206
- BUT BY THEN,
I'LL HAVE PAID OFF MY LOFT.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.942
- HEY, SLIM, HOW YA FEELIN'?
- SPEAKING OF FUCKS...

24:35.975 --> 24:38.044
THERE'S TROY.
- CHEERS.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.948
- HOW WAS HE?
- MASSIVE.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.216
I'M STILL BOW-LEGGED.
- [chuckles]

24:44.250 --> 24:46.786
- WHY, THEODORE SCHMIDT,
YOU SEX PIG, YOU.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.588
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.557
- OH, I HAD IT IN ME,
ALL RIGHT.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.658
- YOU'RE GOING TO
SEE HIM AGAIN?

24:51.691 --> 24:53.159
- OH, YOU KNOW,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.895
- THEN GO OVER THERE.
TAKE HIM A POOL BOY.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.598
- I WANT TO DATE HIM,
NOT POISON HIM.

24:58.631 --> 25:02.101
- LOOK AT THEM.
PARTYING.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.604
DON'T THEY KNOW
GODIVA'S DEAD?

25:04.637 --> 25:06.138
- WHY SHOULD THESE PUPS
GIVE A SHIT

25:06.172 --> 25:10.309
ABOUT SOME OLD QUEEN
WHO DIED OF AIDS?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.879
- I'M ALLOWED TO SAY THAT.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.815
I'M AN OLD QUEEN
WHO HAS AIDS.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.751
- BUT DOESN'T IT
UPSET YOU?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.887
I-I MEAN...
- THAT IT COULD BE ME NEXT?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.022
I THINK OF THAT.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.724
I THINK OF IT
EVERY DAY.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.893
NOW COME HAVE
A COCKTAIL.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.761
AND FOR ONCE...

25:28.795 --> 25:32.298
I DON'T MEAN
A HANDFUL OF PILLS.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.100
- DID YA TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BLONDIE SWEET CHEEKS

25:34.133 --> 25:37.670
OVER THERE?

25:37.704 --> 25:41.708
- HEY.
- HEY. HUH?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.242
- TED.

25:43.275 --> 25:48.147
- TED. RIGHT, RIGHT.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TED.

25:48.180 --> 25:52.919
- THAT WAS SO AMAZING
LAST NIGHT.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.186
SO, UH...

25:54.220 --> 25:56.322
YOU STILL UP FOR GOING
TO THE PARADE TOMORROW?

25:56.355 --> 25:58.625
- HUH?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.693
- THE PARADE.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.161
YOU KNOW,
W-WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.029
YEAH, I WAS THINKING, UH,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.196
MAYBE WE COULD
DO A CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH...

26:04.230 --> 26:05.231
- LOOK, BUDDY,

26:05.264 --> 26:08.067
UM, I WAS JUST DOING
MY GOOD DEED FOR THE YEAR.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.904
- GOOD DEED?
WHAT...

26:11.938 --> 26:12.939
- YEAH, SEE, IT'S--

26:12.972 --> 26:15.341
IT'S KIND OF
LIKE A TRADITION.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.844
FOR PRIDE, I GO OUT,
FIND SOME GUY...

26:17.877 --> 26:19.712
LIKE YOU,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.214
AND I GIVE HIM A BREAK.
I GIVE HIM...

26:22.248 --> 26:24.250
HUH, I GIVE HIM ME.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.085
THE FUCK OF HIS LIFE.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.119
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
HE CAN REMEMBER.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.321
IT'S LIKE A SOUVENIR.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.824
IT'S MY WAY OF GIVING BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.994
- SO THAT'S THE GUY.
- [chuckles] YEAH.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.763
- I SEE.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.967
- BUT HEY, THIS YEAR,
YOU'RE THE LUCKY RECIPIENT.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.704
HAPPY PRIDE.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.906
LET'S GO, GUYS.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.374
- SEE YA.

26:48.407 --> 26:51.410
[men chuckling]

26:51.443 --> 26:54.947
*

26:54.981 --> 26:58.350
- SO DID YOU SEE 'EM?

26:58.384 --> 26:59.819
HUH? DID YA...

26:59.852 --> 27:02.689
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
THEY LAPPED THIS SHIT UP?

27:02.722 --> 27:05.091
- SHH.
DON'T WAKE JUSTIN.

27:05.124 --> 27:05.958
- THE BEST PART...

27:05.992 --> 27:08.027
THE BEST PART
IS THAT THE OLD GEEZER

27:08.060 --> 27:10.296
WHO MAKES THIS SHIT
HATES FAGS.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.298
IS THAT A SCREAM OR WHAT?

27:12.331 --> 27:14.066
- DEFINITELY "OR WHAT."

27:14.100 --> 27:17.937
AS IN, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HELPING A CREEP LIKE THAT?"

27:17.970 --> 27:20.139
- WELL, FOR THE PURE...

27:20.172 --> 27:23.042
POETIC IRONY.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.944
COOL, HUH?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.046
OR SHOULD I SAY...

27:27.079 --> 27:28.247
COOLER?

27:28.280 --> 27:31.050
- I SAW HIM.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.886
CHRIS HOBBS.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.087
- ANOTHER DREAM?

27:35.121 --> 27:37.056
- NO, HE WAS
AT THE HOSPICE.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.758
- WHAT THE FUCK
WAS HE DOING THERE?

27:38.791 --> 27:41.293
- IT'S WHERE THEY ASSIGNED HIM
HIS COMMUNITY SERVICE.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.063
- IS THAT SOME SORT
OF SICK JOKE?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.031
- DID HE DO ANYTHING?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.767
- HE SAID THAT HE HOPES
I GET AIDS AND DIE.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.336
- PIECE OF SHIT!

27:52.471 --> 27:55.074
- FORGET IT.

28:00.046 --> 28:03.816
GET SOME SLEEP.

28:03.850 --> 28:04.817
YOU HAVE
A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.186
- I'M NOT GOING.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.455
- AND MISS YOUR FIRST PRIDE?

28:09.488 --> 28:12.291
- WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO BE PROUD OF?

28:12.324 --> 28:16.228
THAT I GOT BASHED
AND DIDN'T DIE?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.764
- IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO,
DON'T MAKE HIM.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.365
- STAY OUT OF IT.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.033
- SURE.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.169
ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE
THE PURE, POETIC IRONY

28:23.202 --> 28:24.303
OF SEEING YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

28:24.336 --> 28:26.873
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIM
TO GO TO PRIDE

28:26.906 --> 28:28.507
WHEN THIS IS
WHAT YOU'RE PROUD OF?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.441
- YEAH,
AND WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.043
THAT YOU'RE TOO
PISS-IN-YOUR-PANTS AFRAID

28:31.077 --> 28:35.714
TO MARCH
WITH YOUR OWN GODDAMN MOTHER?

28:38.284 --> 28:40.419
- FUCK YOU!

28:40.452 --> 28:44.123
[door slides, slams]

28:50.863 --> 28:55.434
- LOOK AT YOU!
MY RAINBOW BABY!

28:55.467 --> 28:59.738
YOU READY TO MARCH IN THE PARADE
AND SEE ALL THE PEOPLE?

29:04.944 --> 29:07.113
- NICE DAY FOR A PARADE.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.415
- UH-HUH.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.852
- HEY, THERE, CUTIE.
- UH...

29:12.885 --> 29:14.386
MELANIE'S OUT DOING A...

29:14.420 --> 29:16.255
A PRACTICE RUN.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.990
AH, COME ON.

29:18.024 --> 29:21.427
COME ON, SWEETIE.
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR RIDE.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.864
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY IF
YOUR PLANS GOT FUCKED UP, BUT...

29:24.897 --> 29:26.498
I DIDN'T FORCE HER.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.835
- WELL, YOU SURE
DIDN'T STOP HER.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.136
THAT BIKE
WAS PRACTICALLY FORGOTTEN

29:30.169 --> 29:31.938
UNTIL YOU HAD
TO REMIND HER.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.273
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT IT WAS IN HER THOUGHTS

29:34.306 --> 29:36.308
BEFORE I BLEW INTO TOWN.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.846
- AND WHY WOULD SHE BE THINKING
ABOUT SOME OLD MOTORCYCLE?

29:39.879 --> 29:43.950
- YOU TELL ME.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985
- BECAUSE PERHAPS ZOOMING AROUND
ON A MOTORCYCLE

29:46.018 --> 29:47.954
BEATS THE SHIT
OUT OF CLEANING UP BABY PUKE

29:47.987 --> 29:49.288
AND NURSING EARACHES.

29:49.321 --> 29:53.425
- [chuckles]
OF COURSE IT DOES.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.994
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY YOU'RE TOGETHER,

29:55.027 --> 29:56.495
FOR A FEW CHEAP THRILLS.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.530
- [sighs]
IT'S JUST BEEN A WHILE

29:58.564 --> 30:00.967
SINCE I'VE SEEN
THE LIGHT IN HER EYES

30:01.000 --> 30:02.568
AND HEAR HER SOUND
AS EXCITED AS SHE DID

30:02.601 --> 30:05.004
RELIVING THE GLORY DAYS
WITH YOU.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.339
- SHE JUST NEEDS TO FEEL
ALL THAT HORSEPOWER

30:07.373 --> 30:12.011
ROARIN' BETWEEN HER LEGS
ONE MORE TIME.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.613
THEN IT'S BACK TO THE GARAGE
FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS.

30:14.646 --> 30:18.284
[chuckles]

30:18.317 --> 30:22.021
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.529
- THIS IS ALAN APPEL,
LIVE ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.265
AND THE PARADE IS JUST
GAINING MOMENTUM NOW, FOLKS.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.335
THE REVELERS
ARE COLLECTING HERE FROM...

30:36.368 --> 30:40.472
- C-O-C-K-A...

30:40.506 --> 30:42.541
T-W-O.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.076
COCKATWO.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.278
- ISN'T "COCKATOO"
SPELLED WITH A "T-O-O"

30:46.312 --> 30:48.347
INSTEAD OF A "T-W-O"?

30:48.380 --> 30:50.482
- NOT IF YOU'RE HAVING
MORE THAN ONE.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.085
- QUITE ASTONISHING,
THERE ARE, UH...

30:53.119 --> 30:55.254
FANTASTIC FLOATS...

30:55.287 --> 30:58.124
- C-CAN WE TURN THIS OFF,
PLEASE?

30:58.157 --> 31:00.059
OF ALL DAYS NOT TO HAVE
LUCY RERUNS.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.293
- THEN DON'T WATCH.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.030
- FINE.
I WON'T.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.232
- GOD, LOOK AT HIM.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.366
- OR HIM.

31:07.399 --> 31:11.904
- [sighs]

31:11.938 --> 31:13.505
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO DOWN THERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.107
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.109
- UH...

31:17.143 --> 31:20.412
WOULDN'T BE THE SAME
WITHOUT GODIVA.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.680
BUT IF, UM...

31:21.713 --> 31:24.516
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO GO, GO.
GO AHEAD.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.517
- NOT ME.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.419
- YOU REALLY SHOULD GO,
MICHAEL.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.256
MAKE YOUR MOTHER HAPPY.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.123
- HOW CAN I?

31:31.157 --> 31:35.594
- GOD, JUST BE BRAVE.
LIKE GODIVA WAS.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.963
- GODIVA WAS A DRAG QUEEN.

31:36.996 --> 31:40.099
- AND, AS SHE USED TO SAY,

31:40.132 --> 31:42.368
"IT TAKES MORE COURAGE
TO WEAR A DRESS FOR AN HOUR

31:42.401 --> 31:44.403
THAN IT DOES TO WEAR A SUIT
FOR A LIFETIME."

31:44.436 --> 31:47.006
- WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT
AS BRAVE AS SHE WAS.

31:47.039 --> 31:51.677
- I GUESS NOT.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.013
- THERE, UM...

31:54.046 --> 31:55.714
THERE'S ONE WAY
YOU COULD GO TO THE PARADE

31:55.747 --> 31:57.984
AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.251
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.354
- "WE CAN REBUILD HIM.
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY."

32:02.388 --> 32:03.489
- GET AWAY FROM ME.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.291
- ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CINCH IT
A LITTLE AT THE WAIST.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.093
- NO!

32:09.061 --> 32:11.097
- * LIFTING ME HIGHER

32:11.130 --> 32:15.134
- OH, DID YOU SEE HIM?
THAT'S A BABE!

32:15.167 --> 32:17.436
OH, YEAH, TOTALLY!

32:17.469 --> 32:19.038
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

32:19.071 --> 32:20.072
- MR. POOLE.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.573
- [chuckles]

32:21.607 --> 32:24.210
- GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.045
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

32:26.078 --> 32:27.313
- FROM THE CROWD,
I SUSPECT

32:27.346 --> 32:29.315
IT'S A HOMOSEXUAL
DRINKING ESTABLISHMENT.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.582
- A GAY BAR?

32:30.616 --> 32:34.053
- * HIGHER AND HIGHER
TO A BETTER PLACE *

32:34.086 --> 32:36.455
- WH--WHY DID YOU TELL ME
TO MEET YOU HERE?

32:36.488 --> 32:37.323
- I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU

32:37.356 --> 32:39.591
TO THE HOTTEST NEW DRINK
ON THE MARKET.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.193
"POOL BOY."

32:41.227 --> 32:44.596
I CHANGED THE NAME,
AND I GAVE IT A NEW LOOK.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.733
QUITE ATTRACTIVE,
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.736
AND THEY CAN'T SELL 'EM
FAST ENOUGH.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.272
- OH, TH--
THIS IS YOUR IDEA?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.440
- YEAH, IT'S GOING
TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.641
- I DON'T WANT
MY ASS SAVED.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.476
- TWO MORE POOL BOYS!

32:57.509 --> 32:59.078
- NOT BY THESE PEOPLE.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.079
- I THINK YOU DO.

33:00.112 --> 33:00.979
IN FACT, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN

33:01.013 --> 33:03.582
MARKETING TO THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.017
- FAGS?

33:05.051 --> 33:06.718
- THEIR MONEY'S
AS GREEN AS THE NEXT.

33:06.752 --> 33:10.256
- WELL, THEY CAN
KEEP THEIR MONEY.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.059
- TELL THAT
TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS MONDAY,

33:13.092 --> 33:15.627
THAT YOU TURNED YOUR BACK
ON A CONSUMER MARKET

33:15.661 --> 33:17.363
WITH AN ANNUAL
DISPOSABLE INCOME

33:17.396 --> 33:22.234
OF HUNDREDS
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

33:22.268 --> 33:25.271
I CAN DELIVER THEM
TO YOU, BUT...

33:25.304 --> 33:27.773
FIRST, I THINK YOU SHOULD
SHOW YOUR COMMUNITY SUPPORT

33:27.806 --> 33:31.377
BY MAKING A NICE,
BIG CONTRIBUTION TO, SAY...

33:31.410 --> 33:35.647
THE GAY MARRIAGE INITIATIVE.

33:35.681 --> 33:40.752
*

33:40.786 --> 33:44.256
- * LIFTING ME HIGHER

33:44.290 --> 33:45.657
* TO A BETTER PLACE

33:45.691 --> 33:48.727
*

33:48.760 --> 33:51.697
[marching band music]

33:51.730 --> 33:55.201
[crowd cheering,
whistles blowing]

33:55.234 --> 34:03.242
*

34:26.732 --> 34:29.468
- I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME HERE.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.270
- WELL, YOU'RE HERE.

34:31.303 --> 34:34.373
AND YOU'RE QUEER,
SO ENJOY IT.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.874
- IT'S JUST
A BIG FREAK SHOW.

34:35.907 --> 34:36.708
- OH, DID YOU THINK YOU WERE

34:36.742 --> 34:38.444
GOING TO FIND PRIDE
AT THE PARADE?

34:38.477 --> 34:40.112
- SO THEN WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE DOING HERE?

34:40.146 --> 34:43.315
- WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE
CHRIS HOBBS DOESN'T WIN.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.555
NOW YOU SHOULD GO
MARCH WITH YOUR MOMMY.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.467
- THEODORE SCHMIDT.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.336
- [sighs]
- FANCY RUNNING INTO YOU HERE.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.438
AND ALL ALONE.

35:06.472 --> 35:07.606
WHERE'S YOUR HOT,
NEW BOYFRIEND?

35:07.639 --> 35:08.674
- OH, HE, UH,
COULDN'T MAKE IT.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.542
- OH, I THOUGHT MAYBE
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN

35:10.576 --> 35:15.547
WITH THIS YEAR'S
GAY PRIDE PITY FUCK.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.183
- YOU BASTARD.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.251
- I KNOW TROY.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.319
- THANKS FOR WARNING ME.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.254
- HEY, ACT LIKE A PUSSY,
GET TREATED LIKE A PUSSY.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.889
- I'M NOT A PUSSY!

35:23.922 --> 35:28.427
- "HAPPY PRIDE,
HOW'S IT GOING?"

35:28.460 --> 35:29.628
ALL RIGHT.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.697
I'LL DO MY BIT FOR PRIDE.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.166
MY WAY OF GIVING BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.567
NEXT TIME, TRY THIS:

35:35.601 --> 35:37.169
"I'M GONNA RIP
YOUR FUCKING CLOTHES OFF

35:37.203 --> 35:41.240
AND MAKE YOU SIT
ON MY 9-INCH DICK."

35:41.273 --> 35:42.708
- BUT I DON'T
HAVE A 9-INCH DICK.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.810
- WELL, IF YOU'RE GOOD,
HE WON'T CARE.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.579
TRY IT.
I DARE YA.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.415

DADDY CALLED YOU "SWEETHEART."

35:57.456 --> 35:58.724
WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING HIM FOR ME?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.527
[Gus crying]

36:01.560 --> 36:03.262
- WHOA, MAMA.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.831
- MAMA NEEDS A FEW HOURS OFF...
- I SEE.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.733

39:13.752 --> 39:15.153
I'M GOING TO RIP OFF
YOUR CLOTHES...

SO WE CAN ALL
GO BACK TO BEING ASHAMED.

UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ALL HAPPENED
TO BE LESBIANS WANTING MY SPERM.

YOU WON'T FORGET THIS ONE.
