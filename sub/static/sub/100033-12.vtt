WEBVTT

00:16.494 --> 00:19.280
- How is Jacob today?
- Same as yesterday.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.108
- Ava.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.831
How is Jacob today?

02:59.875 --> 03:03.270
- That's why I've been looking
for you.

03:20.765 --> 03:24.334
Well, if it isn't
my daily lifesaver.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.510
- Ah--oh, don't forget
that tomorrow

03:26.554 --> 03:28.338
the daycare is closed
until 10:00.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.513
- It is?

03:29.557 --> 03:32.255
Uh, how am I--
what am I gonna do?

03:32.299 --> 03:33.430
- Doesn't Luna
have a babysitter?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.780
- Uh, you're looking at him.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.521
- Friends?

03:37.565 --> 03:38.870
Yeah, you're looking at him.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.829
- Sorry, Dr. Goodwin,
but tomorrow's

03:40.872 --> 03:42.787
the "Breastfeeding Class
for New Moms."

03:42.831 --> 03:44.615
- Right--whose idea was that?

03:44.659 --> 03:46.530
- Yours.
- Yeah, it was mine.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.576
I knew that.
Bye.

03:56.932 --> 04:00.849
- Hello?
- Um, hi, this is, uh,

04:00.892 --> 04:02.677
Max Goodwin,
not sure if you remember me.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.896
We met in the waiting room
at New Amsterdam.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.072
- Mm.
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.859
- Oh, uh, okay.
Sorry, nevermind.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.861
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

04:12.904 --> 04:14.732
How could I forget the doctor
who snuck me in

04:14.776 --> 04:15.907
to my kid's surgery?

04:15.951 --> 04:18.083
- Yeah.
Yeah, right.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.563
Um--

04:19.607 --> 04:21.783
so, the reason I'm calling
is that

04:21.826 --> 04:24.960
it appears Luna has an opening
in her very busy schedule

04:25.003 --> 04:27.397
tomorrow morning
and was wondering

04:27.441 --> 04:31.662
if Bobbi would like to play
some competitive racquetball.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.751
- Oh, wow.
Yeah, Bobbi would love that.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.536
She's been working
on her backhand.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.102
- Good, okay, great.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.974
'Cause Luna has been
practicing her topspin, so--

04:39.017 --> 04:41.672
- Actually, we have
this routine.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.326
We've been spending
our mornings

04:43.370 --> 04:45.372
in Madison Square Park
across from the dog run.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.069
Around 8:00 a.m.?

04:47.112 --> 04:50.333
- Uh, yeah--no, 8:00 a.m. is,
uh, perfect.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.380
I will see you there--
we will see you there.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.643
- Okay.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.734
- Yeah.

04:59.777 --> 05:00.996
- It's not as though
I haven't tried to tell him.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.780
- It's not that hard.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.782
You just say, "Max, Amy and I
are moving to San Francisco."

05:04.826 --> 05:06.436
Boom.
Done.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.090
Unless you were dragging
your size 12's for a reason.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.700
- Woman...

05:09.744 --> 05:11.572
you are way off base.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.356
Am I?
- Yeah.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.750
- Maybe you just prefer
subway rats and dirty slush

05:15.793 --> 05:18.492
over wine country and winters
that feel like spring.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.624
- Ah.
- Thank you.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.409
- Oh, here we go.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.802
About to show you how bad I
wanna go right here, right now.

05:24.846 --> 05:25.977
- All right,
show me what you got.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.152
- All right, look.
Yo, Max.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.893
Can I talk to you for a second?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.373
- Yeah, actually, you're just
the man I wanted to see.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.809
Uh, can you cover
for me tomorrow

05:31.853 --> 05:33.158
at the, uh,
"Pharmacy Formulary Meeting"?

05:33.202 --> 05:34.421
- Look before we get into
all that--

05:34.464 --> 05:35.813
- I know it's boring,

05:35.857 --> 05:37.641
but I've been struggling
with this whole

05:37.685 --> 05:40.427
single parenting thing,
and, um, I have an opportunity

05:40.470 --> 05:42.690
to give Luna a playdate
with this other little girl,

05:42.733 --> 05:44.735
and I just feel like
I need some time to, you know,

05:44.779 --> 05:46.476
be a dad

05:46.520 --> 05:50.524
and try to give her everything
Georgia would've wanted.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.830
- Max, I--
- He'll cover for you.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.006
He will cover for you.
- Really?

05:55.050 --> 05:56.878
- You kidding?
Go be a dad.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.401
- Yeah?
Thank you.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.663
- Mm-hmm.
- Amazing. I owe you, buddy.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.578
Big time.
Thank you.

06:02.927 --> 06:06.670
- Yeah, okay,
that was harder than it looked.

06:06.714 --> 06:07.845
- You're weak.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.937
- Morning.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.678
Yikes.
Hey.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.680
Sounds like Ashley's trying
to break her own record, huh?

06:16.724 --> 06:18.987
- Nonstop screaming for
three days takes dedication.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.510
- Right.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.469
- I think she's determined
to make a point.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.601
A thank you
from Nelson's family.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.168
Isn't that so nice?
- Aw, yeah.

06:26.211 --> 06:30.520
That is lovely.
And out you go.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.566
Okay.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.829
- If you'd read the card,
you'd know they were for

06:34.872 --> 06:36.439
the whole department.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.049
- I'm only making healthy
choices now.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.705
For Martin, for my kids.
Healthy choices, Gladys.

06:41.749 --> 06:42.880
Healthy choices!

06:44.621 --> 06:46.580
- Okay, do you know what?
Just stop.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.496
Rodney, look at me.
This is an emergency room.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.889
Every time you guys update
the system this happens,

06:51.933 --> 06:53.195
and it's unacceptable.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.240
I need to be able to update
patient files.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.894
I need to be able to check
lab results.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.201
I need computers that recognize
the letter "H".

06:59.244 --> 07:00.985
- I fixed the "H" thing.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.857
- Rodney.
- Just give me another minute.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
- I put Louise Galena
in Bay 28.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.557
She definitely has cellulitis
and a severe fungal infection.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.080
- Okay, we're gonna need
a Hematology consult.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.734
Let's page Sharpe.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.475
- Oh, uh, I wouldn't.
It's all connected.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.781
Just to be safe.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.260
- Go and find Sharpe in person

07:15.304 --> 07:17.741
and drag her down here
yourself, and you--yeah.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.003
- Almost got it!

07:19.961 --> 07:21.179
- Thank you.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.833
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.531
It's very exciting.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.576
It is a Phase Two trial
of a vascular endothelial

07:26.620 --> 07:28.491
growth factor receptor
antagonist.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.710
- How many patients
do you anticipate enrolling?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.059
- Funding covers up to 40.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.235
- And are there any
demographic parameters?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.803
- Yes, I am looking for men
and women age 40 to 65

07:35.846 --> 07:37.587
with naive tumors.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.111
Do any of you have patients
fitting that criteria?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.591
Fabulous.
Forward me their files,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.767
and we will get started
on this bad boy.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.988
- Okay, now we have
a lot to cover

07:47.031 --> 07:50.731
so let's start on page one.
Using objective market and...

07:52.820 --> 07:54.082
- Louise, hi.
I'm Dr. Sharpe.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.518
- Hi.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.780
- May I take a look
at your arm?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.739
- Mm-hmm.
- Now that's pretty.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.958
Is it a daisy?
- Daylily.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.525
I like to grow them.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.833
- There's fabric around
the infection sites.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.748
Do you know what it is?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.837
Pantyhose.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.535
Sometimes I try
to hide my extra skin

08:12.579 --> 08:15.103
by wrapping them up.

08:15.146 --> 08:19.150
When I wear the right blouse,
people don't stare so much.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.152
- They make compression
sleeves for that

08:21.196 --> 08:24.199
that won't abrade your skin.
- I can't afford those.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.158
I tried to leave it looser
this time.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.987
- So this has happened before?
- Yeah.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.295
- Okay, we're going to get you
started on some anti-fungals.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.079
Have you feeling better
straight away.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.821
- Know what would actually
make me feel better?

08:37.865 --> 08:42.130
Taking my garden shears and
slicing these things clean off.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.225
- We're gonna do
everything that we can.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.793
Lauren.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.708
Louise Galena just mentioned
self-harm.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.188
- Minister Reid.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.843
Brand new T-shirts, I see?
Very bright.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.628
- Helps if people know
why we're here, Max.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.238
- Yeah, didn't realize it was
our turn again so soon.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.240
- You can always check our
website to see our route.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.068
- Good to know.
- What do you say?

09:07.111 --> 09:09.070
Have a little interfaith
prayer with us today?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.854
We could use your help.
- I think I'll, uh,

09:10.898 --> 09:12.682
stick to helping people
the old fashioned way.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.336
- I think prayer's been around
longer than medicine,

09:14.379 --> 09:16.294
my friend.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.905
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
- You want me to clear
these folks out of here?

09:19.646 --> 09:21.212
- Aw, no, it's fine, Joe.
They're not hurting anybody.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.954
- You got that right.
I heard after they showed up,

09:23.998 --> 09:26.783
some guy who was in a coma
14 years woke up.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.180
- I knew this day would come.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.096
After all these years,
his eyes are finally open.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.185
And he's looking at me!

09:39.056 --> 09:42.059
He's squeezing my hand.
I can feel him!

09:42.103 --> 09:44.714
- Those are reflexive actions
of his brainstem.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.717
- I have been coming
here for 14 years,

09:47.761 --> 09:49.371
sitting by his side,

09:49.414 --> 09:51.895
waiting for him to look at me.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.593
And he is.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.123
People have been known
to wake up from comas, yes,

10:02.166 --> 10:04.299
but that's not Jacob.

10:04.342 --> 10:07.128
He remains in a persistent
vegetative state.

10:08.303 --> 10:11.393
He's not in there, Annie.
- How can you say that?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.917
I mean, how can you know?

10:13.961 --> 10:16.050
Truly?

10:16.093 --> 10:19.140
- This is the miracle
I've been waiting for.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.837
My husband's back.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.843
And now you have to make him
whole again.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.633
- Oh, keep the change.
Thank you.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.243
Hello.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.593
So I see your prayer buddies
have returned.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.682
- It does feel like they're
here more often, doesn't it?

10:39.726 --> 10:40.857
Why?
What's that smile?

10:40.901 --> 10:41.902
- What this thing?
- Yeah.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.338
- It's nothing.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.731
They irk you,
and I find it funny.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.602
- No, I think it's great
they wanna help the sick,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.473
I just don't know how they're
gonna do that from the lobby.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.650
- Although, I gotta say,
right after they showed up

10:50.693 --> 10:52.608
my patient Ashley

10:52.652 --> 10:54.479
who's been screaming at the
top of her lungs for three days

10:54.523 --> 10:56.264
miraculously stopped.
- You don't seriously think

10:56.307 --> 10:58.440
it's from the praying, do you?
- I don't ask questions.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.311
I just enjoy the silence.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.836
Which has allowed me, actually,
to jot down a bunch of ideas

11:02.879 --> 11:04.707
for our Pharmacy Formulary
meeting tomorrow.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
Spoiler alert:
they're some winners.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.319
- Well, you'll be sharing them
with Reynolds

11:08.363 --> 11:11.235
because I have a, um,
playdate.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.541
- You have a playdate?

11:12.584 --> 11:14.369
- Luna and her new friend
have a playdate.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.676
Her mother and I will just
be there for supervision.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.460
You know, make sure
nobody falls off a--

11:18.503 --> 11:20.636
- Yes, Max Goodwin, I fully
support this next step for you.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.768
This is good.
- Not a step, not a step.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.813
Not stepping, just a playdate.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.641
- Yeah, but it's got the word
"date" baked right into it.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.295
- I know,
but play is the first word,

11:27.338 --> 11:28.949
so I don't think it's a date.
- Semantics.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.733
- I don't think it's a date.
- It's a date, it's a date.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.517
- I think it's just playing.
- Boy, you do not stay

11:32.561 --> 11:34.345
in one place for long, do you?
- Could've just paged me.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.696
- It's not really an option.
We just admitted a 13-year-old

11:36.739 --> 11:38.436
who's presenting with symptoms
of a heart attack.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.525
He checks all the CDC boxes,
and you wanted to know if--

11:40.569 --> 11:41.962
- When New Amsterdam
got our first case.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.398
- Yeah, and Reynolds
is with him right now.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.182
- Okay, thanks.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.576
- Jackson has extensive damage
to both of his lungs.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.230
I'm going to have to perform

11:49.273 --> 11:50.666
what is called
a "Bronchial-Alveolar Lavage"

11:50.710 --> 11:52.363
to determine the extent
of his injuries.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.322
- So it's not a heart attack?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.325
- No, CDC is calling it
"EVALI."

11:57.368 --> 11:58.848
- I've never heard of that.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.589
- That's because the disease
is only a few months old.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.766
It stands for E-cigarette
or Vaping Lung Injury.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.594
- Vaping?

12:05.637 --> 12:08.684
- He's an honor student.
He's in all AP courses.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.860
Have you seen him smoking?
- No, never.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.689
- Well, kids have become really
good at hiding these things

12:13.733 --> 12:17.649
sometimes in, uh, plain sight.
It's an epidemic.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.434
- Jack?

12:20.827 --> 12:22.393
- Will he be all right?

12:23.960 --> 12:27.659
- This is an unknown world,
Mrs. Lowe.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.924
- Even now, your son is one
of only hundreds of cases.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.231
But we are gonna do everything
that we can.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.847
- Um, hi, Alice, this message
is for Bobbi, actually.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.500
Unfortunately,

12:42.544 --> 12:44.415
Luna had something
very important come up,

12:44.459 --> 12:48.550
and she can no longer make it
to the playdate tomorrow, so--

12:48.593 --> 12:51.422
uh, sorry for the short notice,
I'm just--um, sorry.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.512
- Looks like you could use some
positive vibes aimed your way.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.777
- I have no problem
with you guys being here,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.474
but I also have
a 13-year-old patient

12:59.517 --> 13:00.954
with a disease that has
no known cure.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.694
So if you and your group
really wanted to help out,

13:02.738 --> 13:04.435
you could try donating
blood or volunteering.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.002
- Max, these people
are donating.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.569
- You know what I mean.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.876
- But I don't think you know
what I mean, hmm?

13:09.919 --> 13:13.880
I love science, medicine.
I believe in them,

13:13.923 --> 13:17.971
but they can't explain what I
appreciate most in this world.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.365
Love, music, heroism.

13:21.409 --> 13:26.588
So we throw our anchor past
the senses into a deeper truth.

13:26.631 --> 13:27.937
The intangible.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.592
- Yeah, well, I guess when
lives are at stake,

13:30.635 --> 13:32.333
I'm just more interested
in the tangible.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.292
- Hey, Dr. G, did you hear?
- Hear what?

13:35.336 --> 13:36.903
- They just told me
I was in remission.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.557
What are the odds, huh?

13:42.082 --> 13:45.041
- Big Mike, that's amazing.
- Give me some.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.525
You mind if I sit in?
- No, man, please.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.702
- This is ridiculous.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.921
- Unbelievable.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.367
- Okay, okay, listen up.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.021
I mean, we have already
cut screens

14:08.064 --> 14:09.500
from patient interactions.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.893
We don't need computers.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.940
All we need is our wits

14:13.983 --> 14:16.986
and some paper.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.901
All right, come on.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.077
Let's do this.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.079
- Since I can't email
prescriptions to the pharmacy,

14:23.123 --> 14:25.081
how are discharged patients
gonna get their meds?

14:25.125 --> 14:28.650
- You'll write them down.
Maybe here on this pad.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.478
And what shall we call
this amazing invention?

14:30.521 --> 14:31.958
This pad on which
we write prescriptions?

14:34.656 --> 14:36.571
- Um, he's got abdominal pain.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.051
- And?

14:38.094 --> 14:40.009
- Usually the computer tells me
what comes next

14:40.053 --> 14:41.881
after I type in the symptom.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.492
- Are you seriously telling me
that one of my residents

14:44.535 --> 14:46.102
doesn't know what to do
about a tummy ache?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.023
Okay, this is ridiculous.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.677
How is there not
a single working pen

14:55.720 --> 14:57.940
in this entire building?
- Here, try this one.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.681
- Incoming!

14:59.724 --> 15:00.900
- All right,
now we're in business.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.684
Watch and learn.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.859
All right, fellas,
what do we got?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.513
- 53-year-old male

15:05.556 --> 15:06.949
complaining of crushing
substernal chest pain.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
- Okay, what's your name, sir?

15:08.820 --> 15:13.521
- Ikaika Namakaokealohahaunele.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.873
- With an "A" or an "E"?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.876
- Ever since I was a kid,
I was big.

15:20.920 --> 15:26.012
By the time I was 20,
I was about 375 pounds.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.014
I could barely walk.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.407
- That must've been
frustrating.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.541
- People'd say I wasn't trying
hard enough to lose the weight.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.717
That it was my fault
I was so fat.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.414
- That's--

15:37.458 --> 15:39.547
obesity is not
a willpower issue.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.983
It's not.
- Mm-hmm.

15:41.027 --> 15:45.553
I've, um, you know--
I've been there.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.771
- So you know.

15:48.251 --> 15:52.516
Then one of my doctors told me
obesity was a disease.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
- Yeah.
- And like any other disease,

15:54.475 --> 15:56.172
it could be treated.
- Yeah, that's correct.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.696
- Well, I was ready to try
damn near anything.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.743
So I started taking
this medication,

16:01.786 --> 16:05.007
and I started losing weight,
and I felt healthier.

16:05.051 --> 16:11.448
I really did, but they never
told me about these skin flaps.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.015
Wasn't like I loved
my body before,

16:13.059 --> 16:14.930
but at least
it was my body.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.108
This makes me feel like
I'm wearing an extra coat.

16:20.283 --> 16:23.678
People stare at me more now
than they did when I was fat.

16:27.638 --> 16:30.163
- Louise, do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

16:34.558 --> 16:36.473
- Hey, there are--
there are surgeries.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.692
You know that right?

16:37.735 --> 16:39.259
Where they remove
the excess skin--

16:39.302 --> 16:42.131
- It's all I think about,
but it costs a fortune,

16:42.175 --> 16:47.093
and my insurance won't pay
for it, so this is my life now.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.617
- No, no, that is not the case.
I'm not giving up on you.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.837
Okay?
Don't you either.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.104
- Helen, hey.
- Hi.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.627
Did any of your patients

16:59.670 --> 17:01.107
get into Dr. Castro's
Stage Two trial?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.804
- Only one.
- Hm.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.067
Not a single one
of my eligible patients got in.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.548
- None?
- None of Dr. Shoji's either.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.593
Now if Dr. Castro's gotten
government funding

17:09.637 --> 17:12.248
for 40 patients,
where are they coming from?

17:18.559 --> 17:21.562
- I flew all the way
from Chicago for this?

17:21.605 --> 17:23.129
- Sam, come on.
- Sorry, it's just--

17:23.172 --> 17:26.219
- Your father's still in there
trying to talk to us.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.830
Trying to communicate with us.
- But he's not.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.312
I mean, why can't you see that?
He's gone.

17:32.355 --> 17:37.012
- Mom, we know how badly you
want Dad to still be here.

17:37.056 --> 17:42.104
We miss him too, but these
are just involuntary movements.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.671
- I mean, at this point

17:43.714 --> 17:44.846
we're all doing involuntary
movements.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.021
- You haven't been here.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.676
Neither of you
have been here enough

17:48.719 --> 17:50.243
to see that these
are different.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.029
- Are these different?

17:55.726 --> 17:56.858
- No.

17:58.207 --> 18:02.037
- Does our father show
any signs of--what is it?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.257
Higher brain function?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.563
- No.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
- And you told us 14 years ago

18:08.174 --> 18:09.871
that it takes more
than a beating heart

18:09.914 --> 18:13.831
to declare someone alive,
so is my father alive?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.312
- He has no cerebral
cortical function,

18:16.356 --> 18:18.793
so I would have to say no.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.144
- You listen to him, Mom?
Please?

18:22.188 --> 18:25.843
He told us this 14 years ago.
He just said it again.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.193
How much longer do
we have to be stuck

18:27.236 --> 18:30.065
at this never-ending wake?

18:33.329 --> 18:36.071
- Sam's right, Mom.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.726
- It looked so real.

18:40.162 --> 18:44.079
- We all want it to be real;
it just isn't.

18:47.300 --> 18:53.219
- What would happen
if we were to, uh...

18:57.397 --> 18:59.790
...To let him go?

18:59.834 --> 19:04.055
- If we were to remove
his, uh, feeding tube,

19:04.099 --> 19:06.319
his body would be deprived
of nutrients,

19:06.362 --> 19:10.366
and within a few days
his organs would start to fail,

19:10.410 --> 19:14.936
but I assure you
that he would not experience

19:14.979 --> 19:16.764
any pain or suffering.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.608
- ...90.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.176
- 50 mils normal saline
at 24 degrees standing by.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.700
- Initial BAL results show
lipid laden macrophages

19:39.743 --> 19:41.528
consistent with
hot chemical burns.

19:41.571 --> 19:44.226
Basically the same
as chemical warfare.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.576
Any ideas?
- Not off the top of my head.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.578
So let's see what
the CDC recommends.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.232
- When's the last time
you had to look up

19:50.276 --> 19:51.842
a treatment guideline?

19:51.886 --> 19:54.193
- I don't know.
Not since I was an intern.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.585
All right, the, uh, CDC

19:55.629 --> 19:57.761
recommends this week,
let's see here--

19:57.805 --> 19:59.894
"vent settings with low tidal
volumes and high P.E.E.P."

19:59.937 --> 20:01.591
- That's temporizing, at best.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.593
- Well, we're all
flying blind here.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.727
Let me try to locate a, uh,
PCSK9 modulator.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.816
A dose or two might knock down
some of the inflammation.

20:08.859 --> 20:13.342
- Based on what evidence?
- Like I said, flying blind.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.783
- He could hear us.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.830
He knew what
we were talking about.

20:22.873 --> 20:26.312
He was begging for us to stop--
- Mom, please.

20:26.355 --> 20:29.793
- Annie, that was an expulsion
of air over his vocal cords.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.622
Just a reflex,
like his eye movements.

20:32.666 --> 20:38.193
- I can't believe I almost made
the biggest mistake of my life.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.630
- Dr. Kapoor,

20:40.674 --> 20:43.807
how long could he live if
she kept the feeding tube in?

20:43.851 --> 20:46.462
- Conservative guess?

20:46.506 --> 20:47.985
Another 20 years.

20:51.859 --> 20:54.557
- I can't do this
another 20 years.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.821
I can't.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.867
Goodbye, Mom.
- You're leaving?

20:59.910 --> 21:01.695
I don't--
I don't know what else to do.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.479
- He's my husband!

21:04.567 --> 21:07.701
- He was.
He was your husband.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.485
And he was my father.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.922
I swear it's like you both died
that day.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.315
- Sam, your mother has--

21:13.359 --> 21:14.447
- She's tethered herself
to this bed.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.839
Never leaving the borough.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.363
Never getting to know
her grandchildren.

21:17.406 --> 21:18.973
14 years wasted and for what?

21:19.016 --> 21:22.281
- I'm not removing
his feeding tube.

21:25.501 --> 21:28.591
- Yeah.
Well...

21:36.469 --> 21:38.949
- Well, despite the chest pains
and labored breathing,

21:38.993 --> 21:40.516
your EKG came back normal.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.996
So maybe there's
an environmental cause?

21:42.039 --> 21:45.608
- What do you do for a living?

21:45.652 --> 21:47.741
- I work the L Train expansion.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.395
- Oh, so we're both
in the Dark Ages.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.354
- You wear a mask
in the tunnels?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.877
- Nah, I don't like
the smell of my own breath.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.924
- You exercise?
- Only if you count smoking.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.752
- All right,
deep breath for me.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.583
- All right, this could be
pulmonary edema.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.367
We're gonna get you on lasix,

22:05.411 --> 22:06.716
and then back to making
questionable health choices

22:06.760 --> 22:07.761
in no time.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.589
- Hey, doc, just remember,

22:09.632 --> 22:11.895
if I drop dead, the L Train's
only gonna take longer.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.636
- Duly noted.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.470
Where's his chart?
- Whose chart?

22:21.514 --> 22:23.559
- Who's got Ikaika's chart?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.996
- Sorry, I was putting
notes on it.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.739
- Is that a coffee stain?
- ...while getting coffee.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.438
- Okay, new rule, people.

22:32.481 --> 22:36.398
The charts don't come with you.
You come to the charts, okay?

22:36.442 --> 22:38.313
Give me that.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.012
- Valentina!

22:42.056 --> 22:44.537
I've, uh,
I've been meaning to ask,

22:44.580 --> 22:46.756
how's enrollment going
on your trial?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.018
- Great.
Thanks.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.803
- You filled all 40 slots?

22:49.846 --> 22:51.631
- I'm only enrolling 15.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.981
- Isn't it our goal to help
as many people as we can?

22:54.024 --> 22:56.462
- My goal is not to help
40 people right now,

22:56.505 --> 22:59.334
but to help millions later when
we bring a new drug to market.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.423
- I just see people
who are suffering now,

23:01.467 --> 23:03.599
and you can help them.
That's why I brought you here.

23:03.643 --> 23:07.473
- Helen, you did not
bring me here.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.475
And I don't appreciate
your tone.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.738
In fact, now that I'm chair,

23:11.781 --> 23:14.567
I don't even have to have
this conversation.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.445
- No.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.492
- Was not the answer
I was hoping to hear.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.581
- We don't cover
brachioplasties.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.930
They're cosmetic.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.454
- No.
No, no, no.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.630
This, uh, this is not cosmetic.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.416
I mean, yes,
technically it is cosmetic.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.156
You busted me,
but, uh, Louise--

23:39.200 --> 23:41.550
her skin leaves her
with a whole host

23:41.594 --> 23:44.423
of very real psychological
and physical problems.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.425
- Sorry.
Her claim is rejected.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.124
- Hardball.
I heard about you.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.822
I can play that game.
May I?

23:52.866 --> 23:56.130
Why don't I reword
Louise's diagnosis?

23:56.173 --> 24:02.049
"Louise Galena has
Body Dysmorphic Disorder."

24:02.092 --> 24:06.401
And that one is in the DSM.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.620
So what do you say?

24:07.663 --> 24:10.057
You wanna try this dance
one more time?

24:10.100 --> 24:12.494
- Mental illness is not
justifiable reason

24:12.538 --> 24:14.017
for cosmetic surgery.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.499
If it were, they'd have to
cover every sad person

24:17.543 --> 24:19.893
who thought a face lift
could cure their depression.

24:19.936 --> 24:23.679
Brachioplasties are coded in
the system as cosmetic,

24:23.723 --> 24:26.116
and there are no enhancements
or modifiers

24:26.160 --> 24:27.857
that will ever change that.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.164
- But this is--this is a life
or death situation, Larkin.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.688
It is.
Louise is depressed.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.908
She's angry.
She's struggling.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.824
She came to us for help,
and we only cured her halfway.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.740
We left he with rolls
of loose skin that chafe

24:40.783 --> 24:42.959
and give her
necrotic infections.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.744
And you're telling me
with all your knowhow,

24:44.787 --> 24:46.659
there's nothing
we can do for her?

24:47.790 --> 24:50.097
- We can cover meds
for the rashes.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.147
- Dr. Kapoor.
Something's wrong with Jacob.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.719
I only had my eyes closed
for a moment.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.939
And when I woke
he was like this.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.723
You have to do something.
You have to bring him back.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.769
- Annie, there is nothing
I can do.

25:09.812 --> 25:13.729
- Surely there's something--
he was improving!

25:13.773 --> 25:15.035
- He wasn't.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.472
Whether his eyes
are closed or open,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.692
whether he's squeezing
your hand or sleeping,

25:19.735 --> 25:23.086
Jacob is not here.
He never was.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.569
- He's all I have left.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.663
- Uh, got the modulator.
Almost to you.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.578
- Jackson popped a lung.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.058
- The ventilator was supposed
to keep him stabilized!

25:38.101 --> 25:40.582
- He was stable,
and then he just crashed.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.236
I can't figure out
what the hell changed.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.678
- Hey, uh, what happened
to the prayer group?

25:49.722 --> 25:51.680
- They left, like,
five minutes ago.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.999
- Oh, there you are.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.261
- I'm on my way out.
Can it wait?

26:07.304 --> 26:08.567
- It's about Castro's
clinical trial.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.220
I have some concerns.
- So I've heard.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.439
- What do you mean?

26:11.482 --> 26:13.049
- Uh, Castro already
came to me.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.355
Apparently she has
some concerns with you.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.270
She has concerns with me?

26:16.313 --> 26:18.141
- Well, that you're having
trouble accepting your new role

26:18.185 --> 26:20.100
in the department, and that
you're overstepping her trial.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.102
- That's--all I did
was point out

26:22.145 --> 26:24.495
that she's leaving
25 patient slots unfilled.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.628
That's 25 patients we could
be helping, but we're not.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.587
- Well, I hear you,
and I agree.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.328
- I should jolly well hope so.
- But NIH is funding the trial.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.766
They're paying us, and Castro
is in the driver's seat.

26:33.809 --> 26:37.465
- Okay, so we just stand by and
watch her cherry-pick patients?

26:37.508 --> 26:39.075
- No, we stand by

26:39.119 --> 26:40.381
and let Castro run the trial
the way she wants

26:40.424 --> 26:43.166
because those are the rules.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.646
- I'm certainly glad to know

26:44.690 --> 26:46.430
that we're all about
following rules these days.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.345
- Helen, that's not what--

27:00.531 --> 27:01.620
- May I?

27:11.542 --> 27:14.589
Your mother loves you
very much.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.636
- She barely knows me.
Or my kids.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.465
- She gave up everything
after Dad's accident.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.212
My wife died
several years ago...

27:31.650 --> 27:34.609
And I would have done
anything to bring her back.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.221
I cannot imagine
if she was still breathing

27:38.265 --> 27:40.702
in front of my very eyes.

27:40.746 --> 27:44.358
As a neurologist,
I know your father is dead.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.318
His soul is gone.

27:48.362 --> 27:51.278
But even I would find it
difficult to say good-bye.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.325
Your mother sees that...

27:56.500 --> 28:00.287
And she's trapped between
life and death.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.683
She wants to move on.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.468
She wants to let go.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.513
- So why can't she?

28:12.647 --> 28:15.476
- Because she has
pushed you both away.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.785
If she lets your father go,

28:19.828 --> 28:21.743
once and for all,

28:21.787 --> 28:24.615
she believes she will be
truly alone.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.197
- We've reached a crossroads,
Rodney.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.851
- Look, closing in.
No, like, for real this time.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.766
- How close are we talking?
- Four keystrokes.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.290
Just gotta pop in my ADMIN
password, and we're home.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.814
Oh.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.685
- Oh, you are so lucky

28:50.729 --> 28:52.513
you're in an emergency room
right now, Rodney.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.342
- Hey, help!
I need help!

28:55.385 --> 28:57.779
- What is it?
- I can't see.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.607
It's my right eye.
I can't see anything!

28:59.650 --> 29:01.522
- Okay, okay, okay.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.829
Uh, we're gonna need a CT
with contrast, and let's page--

29:03.872 --> 29:06.353
no, no,
run and find ophthalmology.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.312
- Mr. and Mrs. Lowe?

29:10.836 --> 29:13.186
So...

29:13.229 --> 29:15.492
your son's lungs
have failed,

29:15.536 --> 29:19.322
and we had to put Jackson
on heart-lung bypass.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.369
- Will he be okay?

29:22.412 --> 29:24.327
- Will he get...

29:24.371 --> 29:26.852
- We just don't know enough
about the disease yet

29:26.895 --> 29:28.375
to make any kind of prediction.

29:28.418 --> 29:29.724
- Vaping's been around
for years.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.291
How can you guys
still not know?

29:31.334 --> 29:32.901
- The products
are always changing.

29:32.945 --> 29:36.513
And they're not being tested;
they're not being regulated.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.341
I mean, we're still learning

29:38.385 --> 29:41.344
what the chemicals are doing
to his body and to his lungs.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.479
I'm sorry,
I wish I had better news.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.655
- What are you saying?

29:47.698 --> 29:50.832
- I'm gonna do everything
in my power to help your boy,

29:50.876 --> 29:54.705
but you need to be
prepared for...

29:55.881 --> 29:57.273
- No.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.842
- It's--
- No!

30:08.937 --> 30:11.374
- Hey, uh, Mr. Reid.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.550
Uh, I checked the website.
You're right, very thorough.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.509
- Max, what are you doing here?

30:15.552 --> 30:16.945
- Um, do you remember
the teenager

30:16.989 --> 30:19.687
that I was telling you about?
He's, uh--

30:19.730 --> 30:22.646
let's say his situation has
exceeded the limits

30:22.690 --> 30:26.999
of, uh, modern medicine,
and he's just a kid.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.696
Uh, he made an honest mistake,

30:28.739 --> 30:32.874
and, uh, he's running out
of time, so I thought...

30:34.484 --> 30:37.836
I thought maybe you guys
could--

30:37.879 --> 30:39.576
- Pray for him?

30:40.621 --> 30:43.842
- Put him in your minds,
or whatever it is that you--

30:45.582 --> 30:48.759
Um, his name is Jackson Lowe,

30:48.803 --> 30:51.414
and he could really use--
- A miracle.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.765
- If you have one to spare.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.292
- Max.
Doesn't work that way.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.295
- Then why do you do it?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.732
I mean, why else do you come in
my hospital?

31:04.775 --> 31:05.907
Why do you come here?

31:05.951 --> 31:07.909
- You know what miracles are?

31:07.953 --> 31:09.780
They're the word
for the shoreline

31:09.824 --> 31:12.740
between what we understand
and what we can't.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.960
- Then what is praying

31:15.003 --> 31:18.528
if not asking for some higher
power to do something helpful,

31:18.572 --> 31:19.921
something useful?

31:19.965 --> 31:22.837
- When we do it right,
prayer changes us.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.752
Not the other way around.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.755
Whether we're praying for
forgiveness, or gratitude,

31:27.798 --> 31:30.018
or guidance,
we're not looking out, Max.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.672
We're looking in.

31:31.715 --> 31:34.805
And if you can find that
shoreline within yourself,

31:34.849 --> 31:37.765
I mean really find it,

31:37.808 --> 31:41.812
that's when you got a shot
at one of your miracles.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.007
- Hey.
Hi.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.445
- Sorry, I'm--

32:05.488 --> 32:08.491
I usually save
my violent outbursts

32:08.535 --> 32:09.971
for somewhere
a little more private.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.799
- Hey, believe me,
there are way worse things

32:11.842 --> 32:13.540
you can do alone
in a stairwell.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.456
- All I was trying to do
was help more people,

32:16.499 --> 32:18.632
and I'm the one who gets
clobbered for it?

32:18.675 --> 32:20.982
- You get clobbered--
I'm sorry, by who?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.810
- Oh--

32:22.853 --> 32:25.595
By the relentlessly unfair and
stupid system we all live in.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.468
- Ah, that.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.687
- Yes, I'm very familiar
with its work.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.995
Do you, um--do you remember
the patient you referred to me?

32:34.039 --> 32:36.824
- Yeah, Louise Galena.
- Galena, yeah.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.087
- So despite substantial

32:39.131 --> 32:40.741
physical and emotional
suffering,

32:40.784 --> 32:42.569
insurance,
in their infinite wisdom,

32:42.612 --> 32:45.485
has decided not to cover
her skin removal surgery.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.748
They're calling it cosmetic.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.793
Cosmetic--
it's just, like--

32:51.099 --> 32:52.840
If you had
a breast cancer patient

32:52.883 --> 32:54.929
who needed a mastectomy,
insurance would cover that

32:54.973 --> 32:56.670
plus the reconstructive surgery
after it, yes?

32:56.713 --> 32:58.498
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!

32:58.541 --> 33:00.717
Because with cancer, insurance
pays to finish the job.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.111
But Louise has been
just abandoned

33:03.155 --> 33:04.765
halfway through a treatment

33:04.808 --> 33:06.593
because even though obesity
is a disease,

33:06.636 --> 33:08.029
it still isn't treated
like one.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.728
- Then let's give her cancer.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.600
- What?

33:39.147 --> 33:40.453
Hello?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.630
Up there?

33:45.501 --> 33:49.157
I'm not really into this whole
praying thing, but, uh...

33:51.116 --> 33:53.944
My parents did a lot of it
when my sister was sick, and...

33:56.208 --> 33:59.167
Didn't do a lot of good,

33:59.211 --> 34:02.518
but...

34:02.562 --> 34:07.175
I could really use
a miracle down here.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.264
And I know that's
not how it works.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.005
Believe me.

34:12.224 --> 34:15.401
But of all the...

34:15.444 --> 34:17.185
chaos in the world,

34:17.229 --> 34:20.406
all the unfathomable,
unspeakable things

34:20.449 --> 34:22.190
that happen to people...

34:25.150 --> 34:27.935
Can't one of them be good?

34:28.762 --> 34:32.026
I don't have anything to, um,

34:32.070 --> 34:36.944
bargain with,
or offer except maybe this...

34:38.250 --> 34:41.209
Empty part of me that...

34:41.253 --> 34:44.430
I'm willing to fill up
with something.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.129
New.

34:50.653 --> 34:53.265
Yeah, anyways.

34:54.570 --> 34:57.138
Jackson could really use
your help.

34:57.182 --> 35:01.099
We're in OR 7
if you need specifics.

35:07.714 --> 35:10.325
There you go.
Hang in there.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.548
- What are we missing?

35:15.591 --> 35:17.506
- Who has Ikaika's chart?

35:17.550 --> 35:19.987
- Something useful to add?
- No.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.120
But he had some dizziness when
I took him to the bathroom.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.599
- Whew, how about his pee,
right?

35:23.643 --> 35:25.384
- What?
- It stank.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.342
How'd you not notice that?
- Glass houses, my friend.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.257
- Psh, no, my pee smells great.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.651
- No, I mean you didn't notice
how swollen his neck was?

35:31.694 --> 35:34.480
I read your notes.
You skipped right by it.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.482
- How would you even
fit that in the notes?

35:36.525 --> 35:39.137
- It isn't a computer.
You can write on the side.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.356
- He's an elephant.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.360
Let's get Ikaika on dialysis.
It's nephrotic syndrome.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.710
- I think I speak for
a few of us here when I ask,

35:47.754 --> 35:49.495
how is he an elephant?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.627
- Well, a bunch of blind people
touching an elephant

35:51.671 --> 35:54.021
when asked, will all say
it's something different.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.588
The person at the trunk
will say it's a snake,

35:55.631 --> 35:57.677
the person at the leg
will say it's a tree.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.722
Only by combining
all of these observations

35:59.766 --> 36:01.289
do we see it's an elephant.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.291
Numb feet, swollen neck,
foul-smelling urine.

36:03.335 --> 36:04.771
It's nephrotic syndrome.
- Huh.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.688
- You had better get
the L Train done on time, okay?

36:10.211 --> 36:11.734
- Okay, Dr. Bloom.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.388
That's it.
Just gotta reboot the system

36:13.432 --> 36:14.694
and this whole place
will be back online.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.746
- You know what?
Take your time.

36:25.531 --> 36:28.447
- Oh, yeah,
that definitely looks like

36:28.490 --> 36:32.277
a dysplastic nevi to me.
And there's one.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.714
Yup, yup,
that one's gonna work.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.411
- Ooh, that dot
looks super cancery.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.283
- Maybe leave this bit
to the oncologist.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.414
- Right.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.329
- Is this really gonna work?

36:41.373 --> 36:44.071
- Louise, patients
with more than 100 moles

36:44.114 --> 36:46.682
are at far greater risk
of developing severe melanoma.

36:46.726 --> 36:49.381
At this point, let's just say
I've lost count.

36:49.424 --> 36:52.210
So I'm going to suggest
we skip the biopsy entirely

36:52.253 --> 36:53.646
and have all
of the skin removed.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.517
Just to be safe.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.780
- And there's definitely
an insurance code for that.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.349
- Does that mean...?

37:01.393 --> 37:03.221
- Your procedure
will be covered fully?

37:03.264 --> 37:04.352
Yeah.

37:05.745 --> 37:09.139
- I don't know what to say!

37:09.183 --> 37:10.793
Thank you!

37:10.837 --> 37:12.752
Ooh, thank you so much!

37:19.846 --> 37:21.239
- Annie?

37:23.719 --> 37:26.418
Tell her.
It's okay.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.292
- We want you to be
a part of our life.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.599
Your life.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.255
- We just want our mom back.

38:29.829 --> 38:34.312
- There are times when even
we find ourselves surprised.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.226
- How did this happen?

38:36.270 --> 38:37.793
- Could be the experimental
agent we used

38:37.837 --> 38:39.491
to reduce the inflammation.

38:39.534 --> 38:43.886
It could be his own body
fighting back the damage.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.367
The CDC is still searching
for treatments,

38:46.411 --> 38:48.935
and there are kids Jackson's
age who haven't been so lucky.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.939
We may never know what helped
your son turn the corner today,

38:52.982 --> 38:56.464
but sometimes
you just take the win.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.423
Right, Max?

38:59.685 --> 39:01.556
- Amen to that.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.649
Uh, hey.
- Hey.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.564
- Uh, sorry about earlier.
- It's fine.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.436
- No, it's not,
so I made up for it.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.351
- Well, I seem to have missed
the making up for it part.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.483
- Yeah, well, I got a call
from our Insurance Liaison

39:15.527 --> 39:17.659
about a patient who had 107
perfectly spaced,

39:17.703 --> 39:19.879
atypical moles
spanning both arms,

39:19.922 --> 39:21.707
requiring
reconstructive surgery.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.883
She thought that sounded
a little suspect.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.451
- Did you approve it?

39:27.495 --> 39:28.801
- Sure did.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.630
Told her today
was full of miracles.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.940
- I hear you're
taking the morning off.

39:37.984 --> 39:41.248
- No, I canceled my thing.
- What thing?

39:41.291 --> 39:43.729
- I accidentally accepted
a date with a woman,

39:43.772 --> 39:45.034
and I am--

39:45.078 --> 39:46.514
not ready for that.

39:46.558 --> 39:47.907
- Someone asked you on a date?

39:47.950 --> 39:49.430
- Yeah, well,
she called it a playdate.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.692
It was for the baby.
She's a mom.

39:50.736 --> 39:51.954
- Oh.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.695
Where was this supposed
to take place?

39:53.739 --> 39:54.827
- Park.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.437
- What time?
- 8:00 a.m.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.352
- Well, that doesn't really
sound like a date.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.876
- To be fair, she didn't
explicitly say it's not a date.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.661
- Then why did you think
it was a date?

40:02.704 --> 40:06.491
- Because I have no idea
what I'm doing.

40:09.755 --> 40:13.628
Max, doesn't Luna deserve
to have a new friend?

40:16.022 --> 40:17.632
