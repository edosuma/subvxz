WEBVTT

00:23.857 --> 00:24.858
You're welcome.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.736
Good morning to you. Why am I welcome?
What am I looking at?

00:27.819 --> 00:31.156
That is a piece of the car
that killed Ted.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.200
Hard evidence that I procured.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.911
Now, you can have it
and run it through the scanner.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.080
-What scanner?
-I told her there was no scanner.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.252
Hey. Good to see you again.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.672
Uh-huh. I'll move past the fact
that you brought in your own cop

00:47.756 --> 00:49.007
and ask where that came from?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.801
This is from Shandy Addams,
the girl that found Ted.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.845
And you went to her?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.722
No, she came to me. Why does that matter?

00:55.972 --> 00:58.141
It matters because there is
a process for these things.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.267
A process?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.854
The process that has given you
no leads or suspects?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.607
You guys have been at this for months
and you have found nothing.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.734
I'm at it for one day, I find this.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.195
Now I wonder what else is out there.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.614
I wanna see everything you have.
All of it.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.158
-I wanna see the whole file.
-No, I can't do that.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.243
Yeah, I know you can do it
because I Googled it.

01:17.577 --> 01:22.082
You're allowed to see it, but there is
a reason that we don't show evidence

01:22.165 --> 01:25.251
-to the loved ones of the deceased.
-I want to see it.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.129
It is disturbing
and it might be hard to handle.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.923
You don't know what I can handle.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.471
Yup.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.723
Good job. Pound it out.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.891
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.776
[Nick] Out of curiosity, are there any
toll roads that branch from the scene?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.822
[Ana] There's the one in PCH
and the ones that lead to Yorba Linda.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.281
[Nick] CCTV from those?

01:55.365 --> 01:58.701
[Ana] Lots, but without a license
or a make of the vehicle, we...

01:58.785 --> 01:59.869
[Ana's voice fades out]

01:59.953 --> 02:02.747
[Nick] You know, in Santa Ana,
we had a case like this.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.833
[heartbeat]

02:12.090 --> 02:13.341
[Ana] Uh... Mrs. Harding?

02:15.760 --> 02:16.594
What?

02:17.679 --> 02:18.555
Are you okay?

02:19.848 --> 02:20.682
I'm fine.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.772
[gasping for breath]

02:27.856 --> 02:29.858
[heartbeat]

02:30.984 --> 02:32.777
[breathing deeply]

02:41.327 --> 02:43.121
[woman] Wood, Wood & Wood.
How can I help you?

02:43.746 --> 02:45.957
[speaking in Greek]

02:46.040 --> 02:47.584
[all laughing]

02:49.169 --> 02:50.712
Girl, you can't just go in there.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.172
-Girl!
-Where is it?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.340
-Judy.
-Steve.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.050
Hi.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.135
Hi.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.469
Sorry to interrupt.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.014
Uh... [speaking Greek]

03:01.556 --> 03:03.808
[all speaking Greek]

03:03.892 --> 03:04.893
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

03:04.976 --> 03:07.604
Bye, guys. God, it's a great suit.
I love your pocket square.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.064
All right. Bye. Thank you.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.817
-Why are you here?
-She's got a piece of the car!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.403
-What are you talking about?
-Jen, she has a piece of our car.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.322
-She's putting it through the scanner.
-Easy.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.365
Which will lead to us
and she'll find out it was me

03:19.449 --> 03:21.242
-so I need to know where the car is!
-Hey.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
Will you calm down, okay?
I'm taking care of it.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.538
-Okay.
-The car is not gonna be a problem.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.664
Why? Where is it?

03:27.081 --> 03:28.166
It's someplace safe.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.043
Is it at your mother's?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.462
-It's at my mother's.
-Oh, great.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.797
I can't wait
to get wrapped up in this with Eileen.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.467
She's at the lake house.
You don't have to worry.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.636
She's been going through
a lot lately, so lay off.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.055
-With what? Her leather allergy?
-Yes, actually.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.264
That's not a real thing.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.725
Oh, that's not a thing. But somehow
you're ruled by the moon?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.230
-Go back to your Greeks.
-Where are you going?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.940
-Don't go to my mom's house.
-I'm going.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.274
Judy!

03:54.484 --> 03:55.568
Bye, girl.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.111
Judy!

03:57.904 --> 03:59.906
<i>Hi! It's Judy. Leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

04:00.448 --> 04:02.116
Judy, hi. Um...

04:03.034 --> 04:04.035
It's me. Uh...

04:04.369 --> 04:05.912
Sorry. I just, um...

04:06.829 --> 04:08.581
[sighs] I really need to talk to you.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.585
I think you're the only person
who would understand. I'm...

04:13.795 --> 04:15.171
I'm at the station and...

04:15.922 --> 04:16.798
I saw...

04:17.882 --> 04:22.470
I saw pictures of Ted after the accident
and I thought I could handle it and I'm...

04:23.596 --> 04:26.557
I don't think I'm handling it now.
Please, can you just call me back?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.185
I guess I just... I need you.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.354
It's gross.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.231
Sorry. Um...

04:34.023 --> 04:35.441
Okay. Bye.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.654
[sighs]

04:39.737 --> 04:41.197
[roller shutter creaks]

04:49.998 --> 04:50.915
Wow.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.501
Told you the car
wasn't gonna be a problem.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.422
This is not what I expected.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.508
Yeah, well, I'm sitting there thinking,
"How do I get rid of this thing?"

05:00.591 --> 05:01.801
It's always gonna be somewhere.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.386
What if it's everywhere?

05:04.012 --> 05:06.681
Right? You dismantle it, you break it down
to the component parts,

05:06.764 --> 05:08.766
you dump them
in three different junkyards in Mexico,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.268
and, poof, the car is gone.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.603
-No car, no crime.
-Exactly.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.897
No matter what they find out,
they don't have evidence,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.608
or an eyewitness tying us to the scene,
they have nothing.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.485
Ted was the only witness.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.071
Yeah. And Ted's dead. So we are good.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.657
[cell phone rings]

05:24.991 --> 05:28.119
-Where did you even learn to do this?
-Online. Watched a few videos.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.332
I pick up things up pretty quick,
you know that.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.293
It turns out certain things come apart
a lot easier than you'd expect.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.627
Yeah.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.631
-Happy birthday, baby.
-What?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.842
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

05:42.925 --> 05:43.926
[gasps]

05:46.471 --> 05:47.930
[cell phone rings]

05:49.974 --> 05:51.851
God, it's Jen. She keeps calling me.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.478
Pick it up. Tell her I said hi.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.021
-No.
-Why?

05:55.104 --> 05:58.441
What if she knows? What if they already
put the piece through the scanner?

05:59.233 --> 06:00.443
The scanner doesn't scare me.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.695
I'm sorry. Would you calm down?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.865
First of all, my dad is buddies
with the sheriff, okay? They golf.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.034
And, B, I grew up with those Laguna cops.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.079
They are beach town cops. The only thing
they're gonna catch is a wave.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.289
They have technology.

06:13.581 --> 06:17.502
Gee, if they can trace these parts
to a junkyard in Rosarito

06:17.585 --> 06:20.046
with one little piece of a car,
then hats off to them.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.964
-I will turn myself in.
-Stop it.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.967
I'm taking care of it, okay?

06:25.176 --> 06:28.137
I'm seeing everything from the outside
and I'm ten moves ahead, I promise.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.597
I won't let anything happen to you.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.517
Okay. Thank you.
But we really need to do it today.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.727
We don't know how fast
things will start moving.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.688
[sighs] I got meetings
back-to-back all day.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.148
My morning's already ruined.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.151
Fine! Go to your meetings
and I'll just finish everything.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.195
Just show me how to use the tools.
I'll keep going.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.572
-Really, Ponyboy?
-Yes.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.658
I can't think of this
as half-finished anymore.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.536
I just really, really need this
nightmare to be over.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.543
Okay.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.005
I will cancel my meetings
and we'll take care of this today.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.175
Thank you.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.385
There you go.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.433
I'm seeing someone.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.103
That's great. I'm super happy for you.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.192
Oh! Look at this wainscoting.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.735
-It's wonderful.
-Mmm.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.322
I'm in a cottage and I am loving life.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.242
[man] Mmm. Honey, you could do
your scrapbooking in that corner.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.201
[woman] Oh, love!

07:32.285 --> 07:35.663
[Christopher] And the light
in this area too. It's just to die for.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.956
-Right, Jen?
-Yup.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.793
I mean, in the morning, the sun just
drapes across this floor and you feel,

07:40.877 --> 07:42.503
I don't know, forgiven.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.588
[woman gasps]

07:44.046 --> 07:46.382
Ooh, this kitchen! Beautiful.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.718
I'm not crazy about
those sliding glass doors.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.386
[Christopher] I hear you. But  that deck!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.180
I mean, let me show you
where the grill goes.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.892
[woman] Now, let's talk modern cabinetry.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.936
I used to be into a more rustic look,

07:59.103 --> 08:02.523
you know, farm style this and that,
the barn door, the porcelain knobs.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.066
But, lo and behold,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.319
now, and if you knew me,
you would not see this coming...

08:06.402 --> 08:08.946
-[heartbeat]
-Now I like sleek. I like simple.

08:09.655 --> 08:13.576
So that's why I'm gravitating
to these more modern fixtures.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.204
This is a bamboo fusion, isn't it?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.830
I don't know, actually.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.292
Wouldn't you say? I think it's
a bamboo fusion or is it a nutmeg finish?

08:21.375 --> 08:22.752
A nutmeg finish or a bamboo fusion?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.296
I saw this on a magazine.
It definitely said, "Bamboo fusion."

08:25.379 --> 08:27.798
I even clipped it out
and saved it for a moment like this.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
I'm always losing things, aren't I, honey?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.135
Ha, don't get me started.

08:31.219 --> 08:36.349
I even got a filing system and I spilled
Earl Grey all over it and tea stains.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.725
-It does.
-[woman] It does.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.268
-I know.
-Isn't that sad?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.771
-Oh, it's so sad.
-No, this is not sad.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.733
-[woman] Oh, honey, are you okay?
-No. Please excuse me for just a second.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.028
-[doorknob rattling]
-Are you okay?

08:49.111 --> 08:53.241
Oh, my God! Do I fucking look okay,
you vapid fucking twat?

08:53.950 --> 08:55.034
[Jen sobbing]

09:01.541 --> 09:02.625
[sobs]

09:04.335 --> 09:06.754
-[Steve] That crazy massage?
-[Judy] That was Sedona.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.215
It wasn't Sedona. It was Santa Fe.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.343
Maybe you went to Sedona
with your new boyfriend.

09:12.426 --> 09:16.847
No. You and I... went to Sedona. Remember?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.226
Remember that room
with the fireplace and the fountain

09:20.309 --> 09:23.771
and you were all, "I don't care about
vortexes," and you became the Vortex Guy.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.939
Okay. I...

09:25.856 --> 09:27.733
I let you talk about it
for, like, two seconds.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.860
-That doesn't make me the Vortex Guy.
-Oh, yeah.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.446
I liked the hike we went on, though.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.199
-Even though I burned my dick.
-[giggling]

09:35.324 --> 09:36.367
Oh, my God.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.661
I almost forgot about that.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.413
That's a "hashtag never forget" for me.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.833
Well, that's what you get for not wearing
any underwear with floppy shorts

09:43.916 --> 09:45.167
and falling asleep in the sun.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.962
You made me not wear underwear
for sperm count, remember?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.509
There's something else
I want to ask about that trip.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.427
What?

09:54.510 --> 09:56.470
Remember when we went to
the Petrified Forest?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.180
Yeah.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.392
Okay. Do you remember the sign
that said if you take any of these rocks,

10:01.642 --> 10:03.769
you're gonna have bad luck
for the rest of your life?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.188
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

10:07.648 --> 10:11.402
Okay. Well, I never told you,
but I heard a radio show about that.

10:12.069 --> 10:16.198
About how these people who had taken rocks
sent them back years later with letters

10:16.282 --> 10:21.412
saying that, "My life has fallen apart,"
or, "My wife left me,"

10:21.495 --> 10:22.913
or, "I lost my job."

10:23.789 --> 10:26.375
And they all attribute it
to stealing a rock from that place.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.797
Did you steal one of those rocks?

10:31.881 --> 10:35.092
Oh, come on! That's such bullshit. Really?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.637
It's just people blaming
their crappy lives on something else.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.055
Perspective, Judy. It's important.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.807
-Perspective and mindset.
-Okay. Fine.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.309
But did you take one?

10:47.938 --> 10:51.400
I mean, I remember wanting to.
But, no, I didn't take one.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.612
-You promise?
-Yeah.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.031
[sighs]

11:00.117 --> 11:01.452
[woman] Here's that healer's info.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.163
She does a thing
where you hold a baby chick.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.541
You just hold a chick. It will help.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.711
[Jen] Thank you so much.
I'm really sorry again.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.172
Okay.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.217
Before you say anything,
I need you to know--

11:16.300 --> 11:17.510
This isn't working.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.845
It wasn't... it wasn't that bad.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.722
It was <i>very </i>that bad.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.393
Let's just say an atmosphere of polish
and professionalism was not achieved.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.477
You know what?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.980
I promise you it will never happen again.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.400
It won't. Because I can't anymore.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.943
You can't what?

11:34.026 --> 11:37.655
-This. All of this.
-What is this? What are you pointing at?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.281
Jesus, help me find my strength.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.910
We can't pretend this is the first time
you've shit the bed on a sale, honey.

11:43.077 --> 11:47.456
You keep driving clients away.
You scare people. You scare me.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.251
So what is happening here right now?
Are you breaking up with me?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.460
Just professionally.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.214
And I didn't want to,
but you've made it impossible.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.133
Okay. Hm...

11:58.968 --> 12:02.221
I know that I haven't been at the top
of my game the last few months,

12:02.304 --> 12:04.598
but I don't know if you've heard,
my husband was murdered.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.976
So, yeah, I haven't
really been in the best place.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.854
Look, I pray for you
and your boys every day.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.981
I have tried to be a good friend to you.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.109
But it's not like your issues
started the day Ted died.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.946
I've been thinking about having
this conversation with you for years.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.117
Ever since the Shorewood condos,
when you ripped apart that ficus.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.079
Oh, my God. You were with me on that.
We both hated that ficus.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.414
It did not belong there.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.293
What about Crystal Cove, when you yelled
at that sweet couple, the Walshes?

12:32.501 --> 12:34.462
What? It wasn't...

12:34.754 --> 12:36.046
She was racist.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.423
She was 80.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.093
Jen, your anger is untenable.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.054
And I don't know how to help you with it.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.891
I just know I can't do this anymore.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.898
I'm sorry.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.998
Hi. Excuse me. Do you know
where I could find Judy Hale?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.209
Never heard of her.

13:14.084 --> 13:14.919
Okay.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.048
-[sighs]
-[Abe] Are you a friend of Judy's?

13:20.424 --> 13:21.342
[Jen] Yeah.

13:22.092 --> 13:22.968
Hi.

13:23.844 --> 13:24.720
I'm Jen.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.015
Oh, you're the nice lady
that she stays with?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.559
And you must be Abe.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.102
My whole life.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.605
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.067
Judy...

13:39.485 --> 13:41.445
-called in sick.
-Really?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.073
I don't think she's sick.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.326
Well, she's probably
with that asshole, Steve.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.494
Hmm.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.579
I think you might be right.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.416
[sighs heavily]

13:54.667 --> 13:55.835
You okay, sweetheart?

13:59.421 --> 14:00.381
Yeah. I...

14:00.965 --> 14:02.466
just had a really shitty day.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.803
Actually, a few shitty years.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.222
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.224
It's okay.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.352
'Cause I think maybe I deserve it.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.145
[Abe groans]

14:15.354 --> 14:19.108
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
I don't believe in deserves.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.112
You think the child at Auschwitz
got what he deserved?

14:23.195 --> 14:25.114
Oh, God. Of course not.

14:25.197 --> 14:29.034
No, I just...
I just think I deserve this day.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.791
Don't be so hard on yourself.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Thanks, Abe.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.340
I can see why Judy loves you so much.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.342
Me too.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.681
Look at us.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.184
Sharing a little Cuervo Tradicional.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.272
Oh, is it <i>tradicional?</i>

14:59.565 --> 15:01.567
-That's how you're supposed to say it.
-[giggles]

15:01.859 --> 15:03.861
You don't have to roll the R
a bit or anything?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.696
[both chuckling]

15:06.947 --> 15:08.782
Man, I can't wait to
get rid of that thing.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.160
I wish I'd never bought you that.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.703
You didn't know.

15:15.205 --> 15:19.251
The truth is, I wish I'd done
a lot of things differently...

15:20.628 --> 15:21.462
with us.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.423
Yeah. Me too.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.177
We were good together.

15:28.636 --> 15:33.182
I know we had some hard times, but...
yeah, there were some great times too.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.936
And I really hope that...

15:38.479 --> 15:39.521
this new guy...

15:41.690 --> 15:43.192
knows how to take care of you.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.611
-Don't do that.
-Do what?

15:45.694 --> 15:49.490
The whole "I hope this new guy
can take care of you the way I did."

15:50.449 --> 15:53.410
And that thing that you're doing
right now with your eyes.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.246
What? I can't use my eyes?

15:57.122 --> 15:59.375
The way that you're
looking at me, just stop.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.960
I'm looking at you like a person.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.170
I do not think you look
at your grandmother like that.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.882
You have no idea how I look
at my grandmother. My grandmother...

16:08.050 --> 16:10.260
-was a very handsome woman.
-[giggles]

16:14.473 --> 16:15.474
She was.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.981
-What?
-It's that.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.400
-That thing.
-Don't know what you're talking about.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.735
-It's not a thing.
-It <i>is </i>a thing.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.321
There's no thing. You're making it
a thing by calling it a thing.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.700
I am definitely not making it a thing.
It is already a thing that exists

16:33.033 --> 16:35.869
and I'm pointing it out.
And you don't need a microscope to see it.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.289
-Oh, so I'm in science class now?
-Oh, yeah.

16:39.915 --> 16:40.916
You are. [chuckling]

16:42.209 --> 16:43.585
-Shut up.
-What?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.965
I know you know what you're doing.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.676
How about we do a little test?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.429
-I'm gonna close my eyes.
-Okay.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.098
-When I open them...
-Mm-hm.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.933
you tell me if there's a thing.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.062
-Are you ready?
-Fine. Sure.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.219
[sighs]

17:39.892 --> 17:41.518
-[knocking]
-Judy?

17:41.977 --> 17:42.811
Oh.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.146
-Hi.
-[Nick] Hey.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.231
Uh... Thought I'd stop by,
see if you're doing okay.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.318
And I came across this piece of pie.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.153
That's very sweet of you.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.113
Come on in.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.117
Can I get you a glass of wine
or a beer or something?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.578
-Beer. Beer would be great.
-Beer it is. All right.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.171
-There you go.
-Thanks.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.341
How you holding up?
I know this morning was a lot to take in.

18:12.966 --> 18:13.842
Yeah.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.303
How was the rest of your day?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.305
Incredibly shitty.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.349
Worst one yet.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.977
Of course not as bad as the day my husband
went for a run and never came back.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.146
Because that was a...
that was a real bummer.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.356
Right.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.069
Anyway, that's very nice of you
to check up on me.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.823
I'm sure none of the reason
you're here is to see Judy.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.658
Oh! Nope. God, no.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.744
No, I'm really...
I'm trying to avoid her, you know.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.788
-Right. By showing up to where she lives?
-Yeah.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.332
Exactly. And ponder what kind
of baked goods she might like.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.459
Mmm. It's carrot cake, by the way.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.296
-Carrot cake.
-And, uh... she's not here.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.715
-He went out for a run?
-Hmm?

18:54.007 --> 18:55.843
Ted. You said
he went for a run that night?

18:55.968 --> 18:56.802
Yeah.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.263
I saw in the file he was wearing Vans.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.935
Yeah. Yeah, he was wearing Vans.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.646
He didn't like running shoes.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.857
Didn't even own any.

19:10.774 --> 19:13.193
Something about toughening up
the bottom of his feet.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.695
-[Nick scoffs]
-Yeah.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.071
Yeah.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.865
This IPA is good.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.741
It's, like, hoppy. It's really hoppy.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.701
Oh, you know what?

19:20.784 --> 19:23.954
I'm so sorry, I really...
I should take myself to bed. I'm just...

19:24.037 --> 19:26.331
-A big day tomorrow.
-Yeah. Okay.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.041
Figuring out my life.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.003
-Yeah, got it.
-I'll tell Judy you stopped by,

19:31.086 --> 19:32.337
-not to see her.
-Mm-hm.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.756
-Not to see her.
-No. Of course not.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.341
-Yeah. Thanks.
-Bye, Nick.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.509
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.969
-Good night.
-Good night.

19:48.103 --> 19:48.937
Okay.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.232
I really did love that car.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.775
I know you did.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.573
-All right.
-Careful.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.410
[Steve] Oh! Uh...

20:06.496 --> 20:09.374
[sighs deeply]
I gotta be honest with you. Um...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.001
I...

20:12.211 --> 20:13.045
I did.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.048
You did what?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.049
Uh...

20:17.591 --> 20:20.010
Take one of the rocks
from the Petrified Forest.

20:22.095 --> 20:22.930
Didn't you?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.349
-No.
-Come on.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.393
No, I did not, Steve.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.103
Why not?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.232
What do you mean, why not?
Because those are sacred rocks.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.692
Because they asked you not to take them.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.528
Because there is a sign there that says,
"This is bad luck."

20:38.612 --> 20:40.906
Oh, please.
My life is ruined because I stole a rock?

20:40.989 --> 20:43.033
But not because I'm a jack-off?
[mutters mockingly]

20:43.158 --> 20:45.160
Come on. I promise you, it doesn't matter.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.787
Everything is gonna be fine.

20:47.704 --> 20:48.705
Okay?

20:50.457 --> 20:51.375
I'll call you later.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.668
[engine revs]

21:20.654 --> 21:21.488
[door opens]

21:23.949 --> 21:24.783
[Jen] Hey.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.202
-What the fuck?
-[Judy] Hi.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.579
Look, I don't even know what to say.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.333
-Jen...
-No. It is so fucked up.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.876
Jen, I'm so sorry.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.421
You were with Steve, weren't you?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.508
I... I was.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.345
You know what? You could at least
have texted me back. Jesus, Judy.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.515
The last time someone that I loved
didn't call me back, he was dead.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.017
Oh, my God.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.311
You're right.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.982
-I'm so sorry. I'm such an asshole.
-I needed you today.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.359
Like, really needed you.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.404
And that's very hard for me to admit.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.741
I'm sorry.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.912
I mean, how did it go
with the police this morning?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.665
I don't wanna fucking talk about it.
I'm going to bed.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.292
Okay?

22:16.376 --> 22:17.210
Steve?

22:18.003 --> 22:18.962
Seriously?

22:20.255 --> 22:21.840
What does that guy have over you, Judy?

22:26.762 --> 22:28.930
-I wish I could say.
-Hmm.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.432
Good night.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.900
[Jen] Okay. Yeah.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.236
Thank you. Thank you so much.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.571
Bye.

24:08.947 --> 24:09.906
It's a new day, Judy.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.324
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.994
They found the make and model
of the car that killed Ted.

24:14.077 --> 24:14.995
-What?
-Uh-huh!

24:15.287 --> 24:18.123
And that was Nick and he's gonna get me
a list of every registered owner

24:18.206 --> 24:20.167
of that kind of car in Orange County.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.961
-Oh, wow!
-I know. Oh, my God.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.882
It's a 1966 Mustang. Isn't that weird?

24:27.382 --> 24:30.093
It's just so weird to know that now.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.221
-It's creepy, right?
-Kinda.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.641
But it's, like, yeah, this happened.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.686
This happened
and this is the person that did it

24:39.769 --> 24:41.938
and this is the car that they drove.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.066
It's... it's amazing, right?

24:45.775 --> 24:47.152
-It's super amazing.
-Yeah.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.698
-But here's where my mind goes right now.
-What?

24:51.781 --> 24:55.202
If you were the person that hit them,
wouldn't you have gotten rid of the car?

24:55.744 --> 24:58.497
I mean, wouldn't that be, like,
the first thing you would do?

24:58.788 --> 25:00.290
-Maybe.
-[scoffs]

25:00.916 --> 25:02.167
But... maybe not.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.630
If you really think about it,
that would look really suspicious.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.298
-Don't you think?
-No.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.800
I mean, if it was me,
I wouldn't get rid of the car

25:10.884 --> 25:12.802
because of how guilty
it would make me look.

25:12.886 --> 25:16.389
It's kind of, like, the worst thing
you could possibly do.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.850
Like putting a fucking bulls-eye
on your head.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.102
-[Judy laughs nervously]
-But, yeah, it doesn't matter.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.606
Even if the person got rid of the car,
we'll still know they had it.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.733
-Right.
-Mm-hm.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.361
All right. I'm gonna shower.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.071
It's a new day, Judy.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.827
[coughing]

25:43.333 --> 25:45.335
[breathing deeply]
