01:37.664 --> 01:41.618
Here, take a swig.
And don't backwash.

01:41.618 --> 01:43.620
Shit!
Don't break it.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.622
Quick, it's almost time
for the nuns' rosary.

01:45.622 --> 01:47.624
This is eighth grade
history, man.

01:47.624 --> 01:50.627
Stealing the sacramental wine?
It's not sacramental
till they bless it, moron.

01:50.627 --> 01:53.129
All clear!
Are you gonna confess this?

01:53.630 --> 01:55.632
I'm gonna tell them
i stole something,
not what!

01:57.250 --> 02:00.253
Go! Form it up!
Form it up!
Let's go, boys!

02:00.503 --> 02:02.505
Hustle, hustle,
hustle, hustle!

02:02.505 --> 02:04.507
There we go.
Straight lines.

02:04.507 --> 02:07.010
Straight lines.
There you go.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.395
Come on, soprano, dicarlucci,
shake a leg.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.898
Jumping jacks. Ten of them.
Count'em down.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.901
One, two, three, four,
two, three,

02:14.901 --> 02:18.905
five, six, seven, eight,
four, five, six, seven,

02:19.155 --> 02:22.158
nine, ten.
Eight, nine, ten.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.777
One, two, three, four,

02:25.028 --> 02:28.531
five, six, seven, eight,
dicarlucci, barber, soprano,
let's go! Sync up!

02:28.915 --> 02:32.535
- What's so funny, gentlemen?
You care to share?

02:32.669 --> 02:36.172
Sorry, mr. Meskimmin.

02:38.541 --> 02:42.045
Okay, kick- outs, boys.
Floor! Kick!

02:42.545 --> 02:44.047
Return! Up!

02:44.547 --> 02:47.050
I'm dizzier than shit.
Kick!

02:47.433 --> 02:49.936
Return! Up!

02:50.053 --> 02:51.554
Fuck.
Here he comes.

02:52.055 --> 02:55.558
Floor. Kick. Turn. Up.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.062
What's going on here?

02:59.062 --> 03:03.449
Come on, stand up.
On your feet. Let's go.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.455
Whoa.
Man!

03:09.455 --> 03:13.076
- I don't feel so good.
- I don't want any excuses.

03:13.576 --> 03:17.714
Mr. Meskimmin,
i gotta go to the bathroom.

03:17.714 --> 03:20.333
Is that alcohol
on your breath?
Oh, no!

03:39.235 --> 03:41.738
Hey, how's the boy?
How am i?

03:42.238 --> 03:45.241
I got dust
up the crack of my ass,
and i'm starvin' to death.

03:45.742 --> 03:48.745
You're doin' an excellent job.
Allow yourself
to take pleasure in that.

03:48.745 --> 03:52.248
Guy's been raggin'
in my fuckin' ear all day.
I'd like to kill the prick.

03:52.248 --> 03:54.250
You hear that, prick?
Get him outta here.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.753
Just get him
the hell out of here!

03:56.753 --> 03:59.756
Is there a problem?
Look, you made
your point, okay?

03:59.756 --> 04:01.758
I made my point?
You made your point.

04:01.758 --> 04:03.760
What point is that?
Enough with this
work stoppage.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.262
This is a union safety official,
and he stays...

04:06.262 --> 04:08.765
until the union
deems this workplace
is free of hazard.

04:08.765 --> 04:11.267
I have the money.
You do?

04:11.267 --> 04:13.770
Christopher,
give the union and call...

04:13.770 --> 04:15.772
and see if this gentleman here
has paid up his union dues.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.274
Then pop one
of these wheel covers.
We'll check the brake pads.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.276
I'll get right on it.

04:22.779 --> 04:26.783
I'll get your money, okay?
We shall return.

04:27.283 --> 04:28.785
Halle- fuckin'- lujah.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.789
Gimmie your cell.
I gotta call carmela.

04:35.792 --> 04:38.795
You sure it was them?
They were drunk in gym class.

04:38.795 --> 04:41.297
Byron barber vomited
all over the teacher.

04:41.297 --> 04:43.299
I didn't even drink it.
I spat it out.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.419
- Anthony.
- On top of this,
you're gonna lie to me now?

04:46.919 --> 04:50.056
He's very sorry, father hagy,
and he's gonna be even sorrier
when he gets home.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.558
Anthony, why don't you
wait outside.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.069
He's suspended for three days.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.571
Well, at least
let me pay for the wine.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.074
The theft of the wine
is not just a crime
against property.

05:08.191 --> 05:10.827
This is an affront to
our holy sacristy.

05:13.196 --> 05:15.948
I've asked dr. Galani--
he's our school psychologist--
to join us.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.703
He's been keeping
an eye on anthony,
meeting with his teachers.

05:20.703 --> 05:22.705
Why don't you pick it up
from there, doctor.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.960
Um, hi.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.465
In many respects, anthony is
a normal, healthy eighth grader.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.967
Sister patricia,
his art teacher,

05:34.967 --> 05:38.971
thinks he shows strong skills
and spacial orientation.

05:38.971 --> 05:42.975
But the thing is, though,
and it's not just
this one incident,

05:42.975 --> 05:47.480
anthony sometimes has trouble
following the rules.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.482
Weighing consequences.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.986
At times, doesn't think
before he acts.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.990
And it's thought that
there's a good possibility...

05:57.990 --> 06:01.494
anthony could be a. D. D.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.496
A. D. D.?
I'm sorry.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.998
Attention deficit disorder.
I knew it.

06:05.998 --> 06:09.001
I always knew
there was something.
Well, what is it?

06:09.001 --> 06:11.003
It's an aggregate
of symptoms--

06:11.003 --> 06:13.506
inattention, impulsivity.

06:13.506 --> 06:17.009
Sometimes, although
not always, hyperactivity.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.512
Of course, to be sure,
we'll need to give him
a thorough evaluation.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.515
All he needs is
a whack upside the head.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.017
If he's got an illness--
it's an illness, right?

06:25.017 --> 06:29.772
You'd hit somebody
who was sick?
You'd hit somebody with polio?

06:31.908 --> 06:35.411
- You hit anthony?
- Nobody gets hit in our house.

06:35.411 --> 06:37.914
Not exactly my idea.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.916
I don't know what the world's
comin' to if you can't
do a little tarantella...

06:40.416 --> 06:42.919
on the kids every
once in a while when
they step out of line.

06:44.420 --> 06:48.424
- So what happens now?
- He'll be given a complete
battery of testing.

06:48.424 --> 06:50.927
Psychological, behavioral,
medical.

06:50.927 --> 06:52.929
Let me ask you a question.

06:53.429 --> 06:57.433
These other kids,
you keepin' an eye on them?
Are you testin' them?

06:57.683 --> 06:59.685
The ones that aren't
named soprano?

06:59.936 --> 07:01.938
There's no immediate plans
for that.

07:02.305 --> 07:04.307
We attend every child
at verbum dei...

07:04.307 --> 07:06.809
according to his own
special set of circumstances.

07:07.059 --> 07:11.063
And so what dowe,
as the parents, do?

07:11.063 --> 07:13.065
Nothin'?

07:13.065 --> 07:16.068
Oh, no. I mean,
anthony's misbehaved.

07:16.068 --> 07:19.071
He should be consequenced.

07:20.456 --> 07:22.458
It's a crime.

07:22.458 --> 07:26.462
To suspend that child
from school with all
the money you give them?

07:26.462 --> 07:28.464
I bet that gym teacher
shit a brick...

07:28.581 --> 07:31.334
when your little friend
puked on his boots,
huh, anthony?

07:32.969 --> 07:35.972
- Wanna encourage him?
- Hey, whatever happened to
"boys will be boys"?

07:36.472 --> 07:40.226
He stole from the church.
They don't make'em
any lower than that.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.229
- What a loser.
- That's enough out of you.

07:43.229 --> 07:46.232
His father was the same way.

07:46.232 --> 07:50.736
I practically lived in
that vice president's office.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.740
- Could we not, please?
- Well, you only remember
what you wanna remember.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.743
Yeah, well, i must've had
another son...

07:57.743 --> 08:01.247
who stole a car
when he was ten years old.

08:01.497 --> 08:04.000
Yeah, he could barely see
over the steering wheel.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.502
He was a hellion, this one.
Him and his little crew.

08:06.502 --> 08:08.504
They used to steal lobsters
on the boats on the shore...

08:08.504 --> 08:12.008
and sell'em for a buck a piece
down on bloomfield avenue.

08:12.008 --> 08:15.511
- Really?
- How many times
do i gotta say this?

08:15.511 --> 08:17.513
I don't want that kind of talk
in front of this kid!

08:17.513 --> 08:21.017
- That stuff is wrong,
and i don't condone it!
- Yeah, sure.

08:21.017 --> 08:23.019
- Who do you think
you're yellin' at?
- What?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.638
- You stupe.
- What did you just say?

08:25.638 --> 08:29.275
- I didn't say anything.
- What's he doin' now?
What's goin' on?

08:29.642 --> 08:31.277
- He yells at me
like amiserable.
- Anthony.

08:31.777 --> 08:35.398
I thought this could wait
till after dinner, but
your father and i have talked.

08:35.398 --> 08:39.402
You are not to play mario cart
or go skateboarding
for three weeks.

08:39.402 --> 08:41.404
And no tv.

08:41.404 --> 08:44.407
- No.
- You're not gonna sit
on that internet either.

08:44.407 --> 08:48.411
Every day, you ride your bike
to green grove retirement home
and visit grandma.

08:48.544 --> 08:51.664
- Oh, that'll be nice.
- It's not fair!

09:02.174 --> 09:05.177
Some fuckin' day, huh?
I feel like a bomb went off.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.683
All the stuff
that doctor was sayin',

09:10.683 --> 09:12.685
i never saw any of that
in anthony.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.188
You never noticed the way
he picks at the tongue
of his tennis shoe?

09:16.188 --> 09:19.191
Like he can't help himself.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.193
If he even has this thing.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.195
Something's goin' on.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.706
Carm.
Yeah?

09:34.090 --> 09:37.093
You think he knows?
I don't know.

09:37.093 --> 09:39.095
She knows.

09:39.211 --> 09:43.466
- Are you--
- really?
What makes you say that?

09:43.966 --> 09:46.852
- Are you in--
- i don't know.

09:46.852 --> 09:50.356
Things she says.
She makes remarks,
like this today with him.

09:52.975 --> 09:56.612
- Are you in the mafia?
- She talk to you...about me?

09:56.729 --> 09:58.731
Talk to me?

10:05.121 --> 10:07.740
Did something happen
on that college trip?

10:09.241 --> 10:11.494
- Happen? -

10:11.494 --> 10:13.879
- like what?
-

10:14.130 --> 10:18.384
i don't know.
She seemed peculiar
when she got back.

10:21.504 --> 10:24.507
I think pretty soon we're
gonna have to, you know,

10:24.507 --> 10:27.009
talk to her
about the business.

10:27.510 --> 10:31.013
Yeah, the two of us
should sit down with meadow,

10:31.013 --> 10:34.517
talk as a family.

10:34.650 --> 10:37.153
And with him,
they'll give him the tests
and we'll see what's what.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.157
Right?

10:43.659 --> 10:45.661
Good night.

10:47.163 --> 10:50.032
Good night.

11:02.044 --> 11:05.548
Maybe i don't wanna admit
there's something wrong
with my kid.

11:05.548 --> 11:07.550
But this all sounds
like bullshit to me.

11:07.550 --> 11:11.053
What do you mean?
If he's got a disease, why
do they tell me to punish him?

11:11.554 --> 11:15.057
Doesn't that sound like bull?
A. D. D. Is
a controversial subject.

11:15.057 --> 11:19.945
Is it a disease or a way
for these psychologists
to line their pockets?

11:23.816 --> 11:27.820
Many children can really benefit
by professional intervention.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.208
- He got in a little trouble.
- You don't consider
his behavior out of the norm?

11:32.708 --> 11:34.710
No.

11:35.711 --> 11:38.214
I don't know.

11:38.714 --> 11:41.217
What do i know about it?
What do you mean?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.836
Oh, i gotta
spell it out for you?

11:43.836 --> 11:47.973
Do you see his behavior
as a reflection of your own?

11:50.976 --> 11:54.980
Look, like i said,
maybe- maybe i don't wanna admit
there's something wrong,

11:54.980 --> 11:59.485
but, you know,
if he's got this thing,
we'll deal with it.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.106
If he had polio,
we'd deal with it.

12:04.106 --> 12:07.109
You pick up the pieces
and you go on from there.

12:08.611 --> 12:10.863
So that's what we're gonna do.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.874
Do you have anything else
you wanna say about this?

12:26.762 --> 12:32.268
Well, last time
you were telling me you had
intimate feelings for me.

12:32.268 --> 12:35.271
But you've not mentioned it.

12:35.771 --> 12:37.773
Intimate feelin's?

12:37.773 --> 12:39.892
I think i said
i was in love.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.395
How are you doing with it?

12:43.896 --> 12:46.398
Well--

12:46.398 --> 12:50.903
i just can't turn off
my feelings'cause you tell me
it's a byproduct of therapy.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.539
I never said you should
turn off your feelings.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.043
Well, i already got
a girlfriend.

12:58.544 --> 13:02.665
She's russian. 24.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.306
How old are you?

13:12.808 --> 13:16.812
I find it interesting that
it took you so long to tell me
you had a girlfriend.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.315
How are you doing with it?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.938
I gotta ask you
one more question about my son.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.943
You think i should...
go easy on him now,

13:30.943 --> 13:33.445
or press him a little harder?

13:33.829 --> 13:35.831
Well, that's difficult to say.

13:37.333 --> 13:41.704
What, you want a raise, maybe,
to figure this out?

13:45.958 --> 13:49.461
Anthony? Anthony jr. ,
you get up!

13:49.461 --> 13:52.965
Why? I don't have to go
to school. I'm suspended.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.967
You are not laying around
in bed all day.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.970
We're not runnin'
a hotel over here.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.472
Get up!
Have some breakfast.

14:00.472 --> 14:03.475
I don't wanna.
I'm not hungry.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.979
What you are gonna do today
is get up and go rake.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.984
You're gonna do
some work around here.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.486
Mom, where's my gray jacket?

14:14.486 --> 14:17.990
I left it downstairs.
What'd you do with it?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.992
Hello?

14:19.992 --> 14:23.495
Anthony jr. ,
turn off that music!

14:23.495 --> 14:25.998
Your father is sleeping!

14:25.998 --> 14:29.001
You said i couldn't
watch tv or play nintendo.
What?

14:29.001 --> 14:31.003
You didn't say anything
about music.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.006
Turn it off right now!
Why?

14:34.006 --> 14:37.760
Because i said so
and your father is sleeping,
for christ's sake!

14:37.760 --> 14:41.764
Mom, i can't find it.
Where is it?

15:03.285 --> 15:05.287
Johnny, come on!

15:06.789 --> 15:08.791
Uncle jun, what are you
doin' here so early?

15:08.924 --> 15:11.927
Where's your old man?
He said he'd be
waitin' outside.

15:11.927 --> 15:15.931
- Want me to go get him?
- Hey. Did you hear
the game last night?

15:15.931 --> 15:17.933
Joey pepitone, three rbis.

15:17.933 --> 15:20.436
No kidding?
My mom made me go to bed.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.438
Anthony, why aren't you
on your way to school?

15:22.438 --> 15:24.440
You miss your bus,
you wanna walk through
the colored neighborhood?

15:24.807 --> 15:28.310
Junior.
Big fancy car.

15:28.310 --> 15:30.813
We're goin' to my sister's
tonight, and you promised
to bring a pork loin.

15:31.063 --> 15:34.066
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Nonstop. Don't you
get sick of yourself?

15:34.316 --> 15:37.953
Dad, could you and uncle jun
give me a ride to school?

15:37.953 --> 15:40.456
Not right now, tony.
You be good, though.

15:40.456 --> 15:43.459
Pay attention to what
those teachers tell ya,
ya hear me, anthony?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.328
Okay.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.333
See ya, ma.
Okay. Be good.

16:05.848 --> 16:09.852
Hey, wait up!
Shit.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.989
- Hey, rocco.
- Come on!
Move, move, move, guys!

16:14.356 --> 16:18.360
Move, move, move!
Hey, john, john,
one more day, man!

16:18.494 --> 16:21.363
Don't make me come after you,
you fuckin' piece of shit!
There's gonna be a huge payoff!

16:21.363 --> 16:24.867
I'll fuckin' kill you,
you piece of shit!

16:27.870 --> 16:30.873
What do you got?
What do you got?

16:31.256 --> 16:34.376
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck
are you bringing me here?

16:34.877 --> 16:38.380
Huh? Who are you
fuckin' with, rocco?

16:40.265 --> 16:42.768
Fuck you!
Motherfucker!

16:42.768 --> 16:44.770
Huh?
You asshole!

16:47.773 --> 16:50.392
Huh, rocco?
Piece of shit!

17:05.624 --> 17:07.626
You're up.

17:07.626 --> 17:11.380
Who the fuck can sleep
with all this shit goin' on?

17:11.380 --> 17:14.383
I was thinkin' about
fuckin' jefferson airplane
this mornin'.

17:14.383 --> 17:18.387
How about that?
1967.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.888
Made me think
about my father.
What about him?

17:23.142 --> 17:25.644
First time i ever saw him
whack the shit out of somebody.

17:26.145 --> 17:28.146
What made you think
about that?

17:29.515 --> 17:31.517
Something to do
with my son, i think.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.519
You know,
what's been goin' on.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.024
Why did your father whack
the shit out of some guy?

17:39.525 --> 17:42.528
I never saw him do
something like that.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.530
I mean, he used to whack
us kids around a little bit.

17:44.913 --> 17:47.166
Really?

17:47.666 --> 17:51.170
Yeah, the belt was his, uh,
favorite child development tool.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.790
Hmm.
This was different, though.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.292
You could tell he knew
what he was doin'.

17:58.927 --> 18:01.930
How did you feel about
your father after that?

18:01.930 --> 18:04.433
I didn't want him
to do it to me.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.553
Seriously.
What do you
want me to say?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.555
I'm just glad
he wasn't a fag.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.558
How did you and your father
get along?
Good.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.061
He was a good guy, my father.
Everybody liked him.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.063
He knew how
to have a good time.

18:18.063 --> 18:22.568
He loved shellfish--
clams, oysters.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.570
Taught us kids how to eat'em.
You put a little worcester
on there, you know.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.572
You suck'em down.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.074
It's good.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.577
My mother never
ate anything raw.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.834
But he wasn't around much.
What did he do
for a living?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.587
Retail meat and provisions.

18:45.591 --> 18:49.845
And a little numbers.
Extortion, loan sharkin'.
How did you feel about that?

18:50.095 --> 18:52.598
How did i feel?
About your father...

18:52.731 --> 18:55.601
being engaged in
illegal activities?

18:55.601 --> 18:59.605
Well, i-- you know,
i never really knew about it.

18:59.855 --> 19:03.358
- When did you find out?
- Who remembers?

19:03.358 --> 19:06.361
But you thought of
that incident this morning.

19:06.361 --> 19:09.998
Are you concerned that
your son is going to
find out about you?

19:10.365 --> 19:12.367
Don't start talkin' to me
about legitimate business.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.753
What about chemical companies?

19:15.254 --> 19:16.755
Dumpin' all that shit
into the rivers,

19:17.256 --> 19:21.260
and they got all these
deformed babies poppin' up
all over the place.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.629
Does he know anything?

19:23.629 --> 19:25.631
I don't know.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.767
- Has he asked you?
- No.

19:28.884 --> 19:32.020
- How are you
gonna handle that?
- I don't know.

19:32.020 --> 19:36.525
- Did you ever talk
to your father about it?
- What, are you kiddin'?

19:43.398 --> 19:46.401
No kiddin', tony.
That doesn't sound
like anthony.

19:46.902 --> 19:49.404
Yesterday, he's a little boy.
Today, i gotta worry about him.

19:49.905 --> 19:51.406
Teenagers.
Yeah.

19:51.907 --> 19:54.409
My daughter's been givin' me
all this feminist shit
about this place.

19:54.409 --> 19:57.913
How it "objectifies women."
You know, shit like that.

19:58.413 --> 20:00.415
These girls are pullin' down
$1500 a week.

20:00.415 --> 20:03.418
This bears no weight
with theprincipessa.

20:03.418 --> 20:05.921
Meadow was one thing,
but this is myson.

20:06.421 --> 20:08.924
Boys are different from girls.

20:09.424 --> 20:11.426
Pussy, kevin and matt,

20:11.426 --> 20:13.929
they ever ask you about
this thing of ours?

20:13.929 --> 20:15.931
I lied through my teeth,
but they knew.

20:15.931 --> 20:18.934
Fuckin' nitwits.
They love me anyway.

20:19.935 --> 20:22.437
It's hard to raise kids
in an information age.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.940
To protect them.

20:29.444 --> 20:31.446
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

20:31.446 --> 20:35.834
Who's got an anniversary
or special occasion?

20:36.084 --> 20:39.588
What are these, antiques?
I was pickin' up
the chinaman's vig,

20:39.588 --> 20:41.590
and the fed- fuckin'- ex van
was wide open.

20:41.590 --> 20:43.592
Guy went in for a burger
or some shit.

20:43.959 --> 20:47.963
No shit? Fedex.
They're usually pretty careful
with those.

20:48.463 --> 20:51.350
- You did this
in broad daylight?
- Nobody saw me.

20:51.466 --> 20:53.468
That's interstate commerce,
you fuckin'mamaluke.

20:53.468 --> 20:56.605
You wanna spend eight years
in prison for a stupid stunt
like that, be my guest.

20:56.605 --> 20:59.608
I'd take a lickin'
but keep on tickin'.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.978
I'm gettin' the fuck outta here.
Jesus christ!

21:03.979 --> 21:05.981
What's with his ass?

21:05.981 --> 21:08.483
He's got a lot on his mind.

21:11.987 --> 21:14.990
And what do you think
is going on
with this one, anthony?

21:15.490 --> 21:17.492
I don't know.
How many more of these
are left?

21:17.626 --> 21:20.495
The quicker you answer,
the faster we'll be done.

21:22.998 --> 21:25.000
Whatever pops
into your mind.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.252
'Cause there's no guy?

21:27.252 --> 21:31.006
Okay, good.
Where do you think he is?

21:32.507 --> 21:34.509
Out buying food
for the horse?

21:36.011 --> 21:38.013
Anything else?

21:39.264 --> 21:41.266
Watching tv, maybe.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.269
Maybe he's watchingsouth park.
Number one was supposed
to be on tonight,

21:44.770 --> 21:46.772
the one where cartman
gets abducted by aliens...

21:46.772 --> 21:49.274
and they give him an anal probe
and it makes him fart fire.

21:56.281 --> 21:57.783
You're home.

21:58.283 --> 22:02.421
You know, if it's bad,
the a. D. D. , they put
anthony in special ed?

22:05.424 --> 22:07.926
Doctors say that?
No, the doctors
don't know anything yet.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.928
They just started the testing
this afternoon.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.431
I just picked up these books
at the mall.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.934
Help me to help my child?
Listen to this.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.437
"Approximately 50% of children
diagnosed with a. D. D...

22:18.937 --> 22:21.440
receive help from
special education teachers
in their school."

22:21.440 --> 22:24.443
We don't even know
that's what he's got.
You're right.

22:24.443 --> 22:29.064
Let's just be ignorant.
Why worry about anything now?

22:30.565 --> 22:34.569
You blame me,
don't you?
Who said anything about that?

22:34.569 --> 22:36.571
No, go ahead.
You blame me.

22:36.571 --> 22:39.074
I blame myself.
For what?

22:39.074 --> 22:41.076
"For what?"

22:42.077 --> 22:44.579
For stayin' with me?

22:44.579 --> 22:47.082
I have two eyes.

22:47.082 --> 22:50.085
Oh.

22:50.085 --> 22:52.087
And who do we blame
our daughter on?

22:52.087 --> 22:54.589
Straight- a student,
national honors society,

22:54.589 --> 22:57.092
featured soloist
in the choir.

22:57.092 --> 22:59.094
Yeah, this isn't
goin' anywhere.

22:59.094 --> 23:02.597
"Like father, like son,"
right? What about
"daddy's little girl"?

23:04.599 --> 23:06.601
What about you?
You and your uncle lenny,
thatobatz.

23:06.601 --> 23:09.104
My son's got that
in his gene pool.
Do i blame you for that?

23:09.237 --> 23:10.739
If it helps you.

23:25.620 --> 23:28.123
Hi, grandma.

23:28.123 --> 23:30.625
Well, look who's here.

23:31.126 --> 23:33.628
Oh, look at that
little face.
Ow!

23:33.628 --> 23:35.630
Ooh.

23:35.630 --> 23:39.634
Pearl, meet me grandson.
This is your grandson?

23:39.634 --> 23:43.138
He rode his bike
all the way over
to visit his grandma.

23:43.138 --> 23:47.142
How do you like that?
How come he's not
in school?

23:47.142 --> 23:50.645
Because he was a bad boy.
Ow!

23:50.645 --> 23:52.647
Yes, he was.
That's why.

23:52.647 --> 23:55.150
Oh, he's a big one!

23:59.154 --> 24:01.656
She had a stroke.

24:01.656 --> 24:05.160
Now half her brain is gone.
Whoa.

24:05.660 --> 24:09.664
So, what shall we do?
What shall we do?

24:09.664 --> 24:12.167
Let's see. Ah.

24:12.167 --> 24:17.172
Let's play scrabble.
You'd be surprised
how good your grandmother is.

24:17.172 --> 24:20.175
I don't think so, grandma.
I'm kinda wiped.

24:20.675 --> 24:22.677
Oh, you're
a 13- year- old boy.

24:23.178 --> 24:25.680
You're too young
to be so tired.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.682
They sent me to
a psychiatrist all morning.

24:27.682 --> 24:32.187
I took, like,
a million tests.
A psychiatrist?

24:32.187 --> 24:35.190
Yeah, you know,
'cause i got suspended
and everything.

24:35.190 --> 24:38.693
They sentyou
to a psychiatrist?

24:38.693 --> 24:40.695
Yeah.

24:40.695 --> 24:44.199
But that's crazy.
That's all nonsense.

24:44.199 --> 24:47.702
That's nothin' but
a racket for the jews!

24:47.702 --> 24:51.339
- Dad goes.
- He does not.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.342
- Yes, he does.
- He does not.

24:54.342 --> 24:57.345
- Yes, he does.
- To a psychiatrist?

24:57.846 --> 25:00.849
- Yeah.
- He does not.

25:01.099 --> 25:05.103
- He does too.
- But why do you say that?
That's ridiculous.

25:05.103 --> 25:07.606
Because it's true.
I heard him and mom
talkin' about it.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.358
What does he need
a psychiatrist for?

25:11.860 --> 25:14.362
Is it okay if i take
that pear, grandma?

25:16.364 --> 25:20.368
He goes to talk
about his mother.
That's what he's doing.

25:20.735 --> 25:24.239
He talks about me,
he complains.

25:24.239 --> 25:27.742
"She didn't do this.
She did that."

25:27.876 --> 25:29.377
Yeah.

25:29.878 --> 25:34.382
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

25:34.382 --> 25:38.003
And this is how
he repays me?

25:46.895 --> 25:49.898
Dad, what's that noise?
Noise?

25:49.898 --> 25:54.269
It's a flat tire.
I asked you to clean those nails
out of the driveway, didn't i?

25:57.022 --> 25:59.024
I was prayin'
for somethin' like this.

25:59.024 --> 26:02.027
I spent too much money
on braces for two years...

26:02.027 --> 26:04.529
not to take you
to the dentist now.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.533
Maybe we should call
the auto club.

26:09.534 --> 26:13.038
We change tires at our house.
Watch and learn.

26:17.542 --> 26:21.546
Yesterday,
with the psychologist,
how'd that go?

26:21.680 --> 26:24.182
Okay.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.185
Yeah?
What'd you guys do?

26:27.435 --> 26:29.437
He made me look at these,
like, pictures and stuff,

26:29.437 --> 26:31.439
and then i had to say
something about them.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.942
What'd you talk about?
Anything interesting?

26:33.942 --> 26:37.445
That's kind of between
me and my therapist.

26:37.445 --> 26:39.948
He told me i didn't have
to say anything
if i didn't want to.

26:39.948 --> 26:42.450
That's what we pay extra for
at that school?

26:48.707 --> 26:51.710
Anthony,
the other night at dinner,
you made a remark.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.713
No, i didn't.
Yeah, you did.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.715
Don't worry about it.
I'm not mad.

26:56.715 --> 27:00.468
I just need to know
what you meant by it.
I didn't mean anything.

27:00.468 --> 27:01.970
Come on.

27:05.974 --> 27:08.476
Some kids at school
said some stuff.

27:08.476 --> 27:12.480
What'd they say?
That you were in the mafia.

27:13.982 --> 27:15.483
And what do you think?

27:15.984 --> 27:19.988
I don't know.
There were all those guys
at uncle jackie's funeral,

27:19.988 --> 27:23.491
and those other guys writing
down license plate numbers
and taking pictures.

27:23.992 --> 27:25.994
Those were feds, right?
Just like ingodfather i.

27:26.494 --> 27:30.999
Uncle jackie's funeral.
Right.
Then i was on the web.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.251
I found this page
with uncle jackie on it.

27:33.251 --> 27:37.255
It said he ran some union
that ripped off these
pension things or something.

27:39.257 --> 27:42.127
Uncle jackie
was a complicated man.

27:42.127 --> 27:44.129
But you loved him,
right?

27:44.129 --> 27:46.631
Yeah.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.134
You didn't see me
on that web thing, did ya?

27:49.134 --> 27:50.635
No.

27:50.635 --> 27:53.138
That's right.

27:53.138 --> 27:57.142
Give me a hand with this thing,
so we can get the algae
scraped off your teeth.

27:59.894 --> 28:02.897
I'm goin' crazy with this shit--
what he knows,
what he doesn't know.

28:04.399 --> 28:06.901
He's gonna find out eventually.
What difference does it make?

28:09.404 --> 28:11.406
Me, my father.

28:11.406 --> 28:13.408
It's probably in
the genes, right?

28:13.408 --> 28:18.413
You know, this a. D. D. Thing.
It's probably all genetical.

28:21.416 --> 28:24.552
But what about pussy?

28:24.552 --> 28:27.055
He's an acquaintance of mine.

28:27.055 --> 28:30.058
This guy is a stone gangster,
and he's got three kids--

28:30.058 --> 28:32.060
one who graduated and two
who are going to villaenova.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.563
- How do you account for that?
- Then you got leopold and loeb.

28:35.563 --> 28:37.565
They cornhole and murder
this kid for fun,

28:37.565 --> 28:41.186
and their father
was a successful businessman,
a fuckin' millionaire.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.439
Do you hold
your father responsible
for what you've become?

28:44.439 --> 28:46.941
Yeah, sometimes
i think about...

28:47.442 --> 28:49.444
what life would've been like
if my father
hadn't gotten mixed up...

28:49.944 --> 28:52.080
in the things
he got mixed up in.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.582
How life
would've been different.

28:54.949 --> 28:58.953
Maybe i'd be sellin'
patio furniture in san diego
or whatever.

28:58.953 --> 29:02.457
We were talking last time
about how you felt
when you became aware...

29:02.457 --> 29:04.459
of your father's
criminal life.

29:04.459 --> 29:07.712
Do you have any more
thoughts on that?

29:09.714 --> 29:11.966
When you first started
therapy, you said...

29:11.966 --> 29:14.969
that you had this dream
about those ducks.

29:15.470 --> 29:19.107
They flew away with your penis.
It was a bad omen.

29:19.107 --> 29:23.111
That something was going
to happen in your family.

29:23.111 --> 29:25.480
Is this the terrible thing?

29:27.982 --> 29:31.736
Look, if you know somethin',
please, quit fuckin' around.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.239
I think it's important
to remember.

29:34.739 --> 29:37.242
You said you liked
the history channel.

29:37.242 --> 29:41.246
He who doesn't understand
history is doomed to repeat it.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.632
Let's talk
about your father.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.634
My father.

29:51.506 --> 29:54.259
- Heads up!

30:03.017 --> 30:07.522
- Why are you smiling?
- Just thinkin' about my uncle.

30:07.522 --> 30:09.524
He used to throw
the ball with me.

30:09.524 --> 30:12.026
The one with whom
you have all the static?

30:12.160 --> 30:13.661
Yeah.

30:14.162 --> 30:16.164
Uncle jun.

30:16.164 --> 30:20.785
He was always practicin'
his curve ball outside,
in front of the house.

30:21.786 --> 30:25.290
I was probably about...
eight or nine.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.294
Then my sister came out.

30:29.677 --> 30:32.547
The one who lives
in california?
Yeah.

30:32.547 --> 30:35.183
Janice.

30:35.183 --> 30:38.186
How does she feel
about your parents?

30:38.186 --> 30:41.189
Who gives a fuck what she
thinks? She calls herself
vishnamatha or somethin'.

30:41.189 --> 30:44.442
Soprano isn't
good enough for her.
Fuckin' wannabe dothead.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.945
Why were you thinking
of your uncle?

30:46.945 --> 30:49.697
I don't know.

30:49.697 --> 30:53.201
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting in the car.

30:53.201 --> 30:57.205
- Why? Where are you going?
- Someplace.

30:59.207 --> 31:01.209
Dad, where are you going?
Can i come too?

31:01.709 --> 31:04.712
No, your mother wants you
to help her get the screens
down to the basement.

31:04.712 --> 31:07.215
No, i wanna go
with you guys.

31:07.215 --> 31:10.218
He said no.
Janice.

31:10.218 --> 31:13.221
Neither one of you's
will be goin' if you talk
to your brother like that.

31:22.597 --> 31:24.599
Go on.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.103
My mother was inside,
cookin' the meat for the gravy.

31:29.103 --> 31:32.607
You know, the red lead,
pork bones and veal.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.359
It was a sunday.
But you said--

31:34.859 --> 31:36.861
i said we'd see.

31:36.861 --> 31:38.863
What's the matter
with that child?
She won't eat.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.866
Please, you won't have to
give me anything for christmas
if you get me this.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.868
And you won't have to tell me
to take the garbage out.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.120
I'm not supposed
to have to tell you
to take the garbage out!

31:46.120 --> 31:48.506
Then why can't i have this?
It isn't fair!

31:49.007 --> 31:51.125
I don't wanna hear about
that stupid electric organ
anymore!

31:51.125 --> 31:53.878
- It's not stupid.
It's fun.
- I said enough!

31:53.878 --> 31:55.880
He won't give me
a moment's peace.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.384
If janice wanted it,
she'd get it. Janice always
gets everything she wants.

31:59.384 --> 32:02.637
Where were they going today?
I don't know why i couldn't go.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.890
- That's because your sister
does as she's told.
- That's right. I forgot.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.393
Janice never does
anything wrong.
She's just perfect, perfect.

32:08.776 --> 32:11.779
You're driving me crazy!

32:11.896 --> 32:14.899
- No, i'm not.
- She said what?

32:15.033 --> 32:17.535
She was high- strung, my mother.
Very dramatic.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.537
Every night to her
is a night at the opera.

32:20.038 --> 32:23.658
I could stick this fork
in your eye!

32:23.658 --> 32:27.161
She wasn't gonna do it.
Holy shit.

32:27.545 --> 32:29.547
That's why
i'm rememberin' all this.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.549
On account of
where they were goin'.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.803
- Where were they going?
- I found out
a couple sundays later.

32:36.054 --> 32:39.057
The toll now stands at
11 dead and 600 wounded,

32:39.557 --> 32:41.559
as well as hundreds
of businesses set ablaze--

32:41.559 --> 32:44.062
mom, i'm going to
the c. Y. O. To play ball.

32:44.062 --> 32:47.565
Take a bat with you.
Look what they're doin'
on springfield avenue.

32:47.815 --> 32:50.818
Looting and sniper fire along
springfield avenue continue...

32:51.319 --> 32:55.323
with mayor lou avenitzio
now placing the blame
on outside agitators.

33:21.849 --> 33:23.351
Come on, dad!
Let's go!

33:23.851 --> 33:25.853
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.

33:26.854 --> 33:28.856
Janice, keep your sticky
fingers off the car.

33:28.856 --> 33:30.858
I just waxed
the damn thing.

33:37.365 --> 33:38.866
Can i steer?

33:39.367 --> 33:41.369
Maybe on the way home,
honey.

33:54.549 --> 33:56.551
Here we are.

34:06.561 --> 34:08.563
Come on.

34:43.097 --> 34:44.599
Uncle jun?

34:44.849 --> 34:48.351
Here.
Buy something nice.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.731
My heart was broken.

35:00.731 --> 35:04.235
You felt your father
was showing favoritism.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.737
I still remember that feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.739
Did you confront them?

35:08.739 --> 35:10.741
Have you been listenin'
to what i've been sayin'?

35:11.242 --> 35:14.245
Kids don't confront
in my family.

35:14.378 --> 35:16.881
But how does this pertain to
the situation with your son?

35:17.381 --> 35:21.886
'Cause this amusement park
was where i found out my father
wasn't like other fathers.

35:21.886 --> 35:25.389
I took the bus this time.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.892
It was three transfers
from newark.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.395
I had this candy bar
in my pocket.

35:31.395 --> 35:35.149
It had sand or lint
or somethin' on it.

35:43.157 --> 35:45.660
Hey, what you doin'?
Where you spittin'?

35:45.660 --> 35:48.162
What do you mean?
I ain't doin' nothin'.
Yes, you did.

35:48.162 --> 35:50.164
You threw that wrapper
on the floor.
Pick it up!

35:50.164 --> 35:53.167
Leave me alone!
Come back here!
You're gonna pick it up!

35:59.423 --> 36:03.177
What in the world?
- I don't know!

36:07.298 --> 36:09.800
There he is!
Stop or i'll shoot!

36:09.934 --> 36:11.435
You're under arrest!

36:11.435 --> 36:14.438
- Stop!
-

36:14.438 --> 36:18.059
- you're under arrest!

36:19.694 --> 36:22.697
Give me your hands!
Guy's name was chicky sasso,

36:22.697 --> 36:24.699
my father's cousin
on his mother's side.

36:24.699 --> 36:28.452
Got out of vietnam
on account of that cop
blew his knee cap off.

36:33.074 --> 36:35.576
What the fuck's the matter
with you cops?

36:35.576 --> 36:37.578
Can't bring your kid to
an amusement park no more?

36:37.578 --> 36:39.580
Daddy!

36:39.714 --> 36:41.716
Daddy!
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, honey.

36:42.216 --> 36:43.718
You go home
to mommy, sweetheart.
We'll take you home.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.472
Why don't you go lock up
themoullions?

36:48.472 --> 36:50.474
They're the ones that are
burnin' down newark.

37:01.102 --> 37:04.105
I wanna call my lawyer.
I'm not sayin' shit
to you guys.

37:04.238 --> 37:06.240
That's johnny boy soprano!

37:09.610 --> 37:11.112
Whoa!

37:11.612 --> 37:14.115
Asshole!
You're hurtin' my wrist!

37:16.250 --> 37:19.253
Get the fuck in there,
clarabell.

37:21.756 --> 37:23.257
He was usin' my sister janice
as a front.

37:23.758 --> 37:25.259
All the guys
brought their daughters,

37:25.760 --> 37:27.762
so that when they did
their business it would
look sweet and innocent.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.014
That must have been
devastating.

37:30.131 --> 37:32.633
Nah, it turned out
it was no big deal.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.386
To see your father handcuffed,
being led away by the police?

37:35.770 --> 37:40.274
Well, at the time, i thought
my head was gonna explode.

37:40.274 --> 37:42.276
He looked...helpless.

37:44.278 --> 37:49.784
But when i got home, my mother
had a different perspective,
which made me feel better.

37:49.784 --> 37:54.155
- So in her pain,
she reached out to you.
- That's one way to put it.

37:54.155 --> 37:57.792
Your father may not be
home for dinner tonight.
Go wash up.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.294
I know.
What do you know?

38:00.795 --> 38:03.798
I saw him gettin' arrested.
What did he do?

38:03.798 --> 38:06.667
He didn't do anything.
They just pick on the italians.

38:06.667 --> 38:08.669
Still, in my heart,

38:08.669 --> 38:11.422
i knew my father
was no freedom fighter.

38:11.422 --> 38:14.809
- So he went to jail?
- No, he came home
in a couple of hours.

38:14.809 --> 38:17.311
We were watchin'
ed sullivan.

38:28.189 --> 38:30.191
Hey. Livia!

38:30.191 --> 38:32.193
Daddy!
Look who's home!

38:33.194 --> 38:35.196
What happened?
What happened?

38:35.196 --> 38:37.698
I stopped at nasto's,
got you some cherry vanilla.

38:37.698 --> 38:40.201
That didn't take long.
Must be in good
with the uppity- ups.

38:40.201 --> 38:42.703
Yeah.

38:42.703 --> 38:44.705
Let this be
a lesson to ya's.

38:44.705 --> 38:49.710
Those stupid cops,
they went to the wrong place,
arrested the wrong guys.

38:49.710 --> 38:52.213
How's my little girl?
You all right, sweetheart?

38:52.213 --> 38:54.215
I'm okay.
Good.

38:54.215 --> 38:57.718
Johnny boy!
Hey, johnny boy! Hey!

38:57.718 --> 39:01.722
Good for you, johnny!
Show those fuckin'
sons of bitches.

39:01.722 --> 39:04.225
What's up, rocco?

39:06.727 --> 39:12.233
So...everything okay here?
I don't understand.

39:12.616 --> 39:15.619
The man your father beat up
was the same one
who was congratulating him?

39:16.120 --> 39:20.491
Yeah, one of'em.
Rocco alatore.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.494
Why did they arrest
your father?

39:23.494 --> 39:25.996
He was in violation
of his parole.

39:25.996 --> 39:28.999
"Association with
known undesirables."

39:28.999 --> 39:31.502
But nothin' ever
happened about it.
It just kinda went away.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.504
He'd been in prison?

39:33.504 --> 39:39.009
He was away when i was little,
but they told me he was
in montana bein' a cowboy.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.016
What?

39:50.020 --> 39:53.157
- My son is doomed, right?
- Why do you say that?

39:53.524 --> 39:55.526
Come on.
This is the part...

39:55.526 --> 39:58.529
where i'm supposed to tell ya
how terrible my father was...

39:58.529 --> 40:02.032
and the terrible things
he did to me
and how he ruined my life.

40:03.534 --> 40:06.537
But i'll tell you somethin'.
I was proud to be
johnny soprano's kid.

40:06.537 --> 40:09.039
When he beat the shit
out of that guy,
i went to the class,

40:09.039 --> 40:11.542
i told'em how tough
my father was.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.677
Do you think that's how
your son feels about you?

40:14.044 --> 40:16.046
Yeah, probably.
And i'm glad.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.048
I'm glad if he's proud of me.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.685
But that's the bind i'm in,
'cause i don't want him
to be like me.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.687
He can be anything
he wants to be.

40:23.938 --> 40:25.940
He could be like, um,
this guy i knew in high school.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.943
His grandfather invented
these little ties that go
on the end of salamis.

40:28.943 --> 40:32.813
He made millions of dollars.
He's sittin' on his ass.

40:32.813 --> 40:35.316
Have you communicated
any of this to your son?

40:35.449 --> 40:37.451
Not in so many words.

40:40.955 --> 40:42.957
Probably not at all.

40:44.458 --> 40:46.460
What difference would it make?
You said so yourself.

40:46.460 --> 40:49.463
It's in the blood.
It's hereditary.

40:49.830 --> 40:53.334
Genetic predispositions
are only that--
predispositions.

40:53.334 --> 40:57.338
It's not a destiny
written in stone.
People have choices.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.590
She finally offers an opinion.

41:00.090 --> 41:04.094
Well, they do.
You think that everything
that happens is preordained?

41:04.094 --> 41:08.098
You don't think that
human beings possess free will?

41:08.098 --> 41:10.484
How come i'm not makin'
fuckin' pots in peru?

41:11.986 --> 41:15.489
You're born to this shit.
You are what you are.

41:15.990 --> 41:20.494
Within that,
there's a range of choices.
This is america.

41:20.611 --> 41:23.614
Right. America.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.617
So, livia, what do you think?

41:26.617 --> 41:29.119
Huh?
Okies and misfits.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.121
That's who goes there--
losers.

41:31.121 --> 41:34.625
The beverly hillbillies.
So now rocco alatore's
a loser?

41:34.625 --> 41:39.129
I know i've had to rough
rocco up because of money, but
the guy's got a fuckin' brain.

41:39.513 --> 41:41.015
He's gonna open
a new book out there.

41:41.515 --> 41:43.517
And after that gets up,
we get a little
cash flow goin'--

41:43.517 --> 41:46.520
oh, mr. Cash flow.
Big business man now.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.890
Well, what do you know
about it? You're scared
of your own shadow.

41:50.391 --> 41:52.893
Reno is growin'
by leaps and bounds, livia.

41:52.893 --> 41:55.396
It's a chance to get in
on the ground floor!

41:55.896 --> 41:58.399
After rocco gets a book up,
he's gonna open
a new supper club.

41:58.399 --> 42:00.150
He wantsmeto run it.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.653
A supper club.
Are you drunk?

42:02.653 --> 42:05.155
Jesus christ almighty!

42:05.155 --> 42:07.157
Fuckin' albacore
around my neck!

42:07.157 --> 42:10.160
Every time i try to do
somethin'-- me and the kids
will go without ya!

42:10.544 --> 42:13.047
They are not goin'
anywhere!

42:13.047 --> 42:16.050
I'd rather smother them
with a pillow...

42:16.050 --> 42:20.054
then take them to nevada!
Always with the drama!

42:26.227 --> 42:28.729
Livia.
Here you are.
Oh, junior.

42:28.729 --> 42:30.731
You scared me to death.

42:30.731 --> 42:33.734
I can't stay,
but i didn't wanna let
another day go by.

42:34.235 --> 42:36.237
Business headaches
like you wouldn't believe.

42:36.237 --> 42:40.608
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You and theotherone,
with all your headaches.

42:41.108 --> 42:44.111
Who, tony?
You shouldn't be
so hard on him.

42:44.612 --> 42:47.114
He's got a lot to learn,
granted, but he's headed
in the right direction.

42:47.248 --> 42:51.252
Where to? Overbrook
state mental hospital?

42:51.252 --> 42:53.120
What?

42:53.621 --> 42:55.623
Hey, uncle jun.
How ya doin'?

42:55.623 --> 42:57.625
Hey.

43:00.628 --> 43:02.630
He's keepin' his hair.

43:02.630 --> 43:06.133
You see, what a good boy,
he comes to visit his mother.

43:08.385 --> 43:10.888
Um, my son's stayin'
for dinner, junior.

43:11.388 --> 43:13.390
I don't suppose
you have time.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.526
You two wanna
visit each other.

43:15.776 --> 43:19.897
Junior's very busy these days
with his headaches.

43:19.897 --> 43:22.399
Not too busy to shoot the shit
with you, tony.

43:22.399 --> 43:24.401
We gotta try
and catch a ball game.

43:24.902 --> 43:27.404
Yeah, you got my number.
All right.

43:28.405 --> 43:30.407
That man...

43:30.407 --> 43:33.911
is so full of himself
since becomingcopporuggi.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.913
He makes me sick.

43:41.669 --> 43:43.671
You remember
the alatores, ma?

43:43.671 --> 43:47.174
Oh, why wouldn't i?
You know, they moved to nevada.

43:47.174 --> 43:52.179
They're billionaires now.
Oh, that rocco alatore,
he was a real go- getter.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.182
Didn't dad
wanna go with him?
Your father?

43:55.182 --> 43:58.686
No.
Yeah, he did.

43:58.686 --> 44:00.688
I remember you guys
talkin' about it.

44:01.188 --> 44:03.691
Alatore was gonna start
a business. Dad was gonna
do a little thing with him.

44:03.691 --> 44:06.694
Oh, well, rocco just got him
all worked up, that's all.

44:06.694 --> 44:09.330
What is this
with all these questions?

44:09.830 --> 44:12.833
Dad wanted to go with him.
You wouldn't let him.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.952
Let him?
Mmm.

44:15.452 --> 44:18.455
What do you mean?
You just tell me...

44:18.455 --> 44:22.960
one time your father didn't do
exactly as he wanted.

44:24.461 --> 44:26.463
I don't know.

44:26.463 --> 44:28.966
Maybe this was his chance
to get out.

44:28.966 --> 44:31.468
Dad was no choir boy,
but maybe with
a little bit of support.

44:31.602 --> 44:35.606
Oh, mr. Sensitive, now.

44:35.606 --> 44:39.610
Well, if it bothers you,
maybe you better talk
to a psychiatrist.

44:43.614 --> 44:46.617
Whoa.
What are you talkin' about,
a psychiatrist?

44:46.984 --> 44:49.486
Well, that's what people do
when they're lookin'...

44:49.486 --> 44:52.122
for somebody to blame
for their life, isn't it?

44:52.122 --> 44:54.124
You're a real stone player,
aren't you, ma?

44:54.625 --> 44:59.129
You threatened
to smother his children.
What does that mean?

44:59.380 --> 45:02.383
Everybody thought dad
was the ruthless one,
but i gotta hand it to you.

45:02.383 --> 45:04.885
If you'd been born
after those feminists,

45:05.386 --> 45:08.389
you woulda been
the real gangster.

45:08.505 --> 45:12.009
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

45:18.015 --> 45:20.651
Hi. Hi, please, sit.

45:21.151 --> 45:25.656
I know you're probably eager
to hear the results
of our testing.

45:25.656 --> 45:29.159
How's anthony doing?
Uh, good, i think.
Don't you think so, tony?

45:29.159 --> 45:31.662
Yeah, i think so.
Okay.

45:31.662 --> 45:35.666
Well, good.
Uh, let's get to it.

45:37.167 --> 45:40.671
The good news is,
no evidence of
learning disability.

45:42.172 --> 45:44.174
Cognitive function,
verbal and nonverbal,

45:44.291 --> 45:47.795
intelligence testing,
arithmetic and
reading evaluation...

45:48.295 --> 45:50.297
all within
the normal range.
Oh, thank goodness.

45:50.297 --> 45:52.800
Got a clean bill of health
from his pediatrician.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.803
No soft sign on
the neurological either.

45:55.803 --> 45:59.807
That's all the good news.
Now, why don't you tell us
the bad news.

45:59.807 --> 46:01.809
Well...

46:01.809 --> 46:04.812
as to whether anthony
has a. D. D.

46:04.812 --> 46:07.314
The results
were interesting.

46:07.314 --> 46:09.316
The a. P. A. Standard
is for the subject...

46:09.817 --> 46:13.821
to manifest six out of
nine possible symptoms
of a. D. D.

46:14.321 --> 46:17.708
In testing, anthony manifested
five of those symptoms.

46:18.208 --> 46:19.710
Five? Really?

46:19.710 --> 46:23.330
He often has difficulty
awaiting his turn;

46:23.330 --> 46:27.835
is often "on the go,"
or acts as if driven by a motor;

46:27.835 --> 46:30.838
often interrupts
or intrudes on others;

46:30.838 --> 46:33.974
and often fidgets
with hands or feet.

46:33.974 --> 46:35.976
He "fidgets with
hands or feet"?

46:36.343 --> 46:38.595
That's right.

46:40.230 --> 46:42.599
You mean, like,
he fidgets?

46:42.983 --> 46:44.485
Uh- huh.

46:44.985 --> 46:46.987
And that's a sickness,
the fidget?

46:47.488 --> 46:51.492
Mr. Soprano, it's one
of nine possible symptoms.
