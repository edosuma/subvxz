WEBVTT

00:14.972 --> 00:17.058
...A squall from the southeast

00:17.058 --> 00:18.976
Last night's severe thunderstorms

00:18.976 --> 00:20.770
... caused damage to oceanographic
buoys in the Florida Straits

00:21.103 --> 00:23.397
I'm not working on my
tan out here, fellas

00:23.397 --> 00:24.857
The storms have dissipated

00:25.233 --> 00:26.984
...And the weather service has
lifted the small craft advisory...

00:39.622 --> 00:40.831
Ho, baby!

00:40.831 --> 00:42.542
That's what I'm talking about!

00:42.792 --> 00:44.168
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Give it here

00:44.377 --> 00:46.420
Come on

00:46.420 --> 00:47.839
Come on, baby

00:48.047 --> 00:49.590
Ain't no use in fighting

00:51.342 --> 00:52.510
Come on

00:53.511 --> 00:54.846
Yo!

01:02.311 --> 01:03.521
It was nip and tuck there for a while

01:04.688 --> 01:06.065
I think I'm a pretty strong guy

01:06.065 --> 01:08.109
but I'm telling ya,
that sucker hit that line!

01:08.109 --> 01:09.110
It was all over

01:09.110 --> 01:10.778
I said, "how am I gonna
get this thing up?"

01:10.778 --> 01:12.989
I'm struggling with it ...

01:16.701 --> 01:19.287
It's your fish, Chief

01:21.914 --> 01:25.418
Sure is gonna look
pretty on my wall

01:25.918 --> 01:27.044
Just give it a good jab

01:27.545 --> 01:28.796
and enjoy the ride up

01:34.886 --> 01:35.887
Oh!

01:36.137 --> 01:37.305
What the hell was that?

01:55.239 --> 01:56.282
This all there is?

01:56.532 --> 01:58.910
Yep. Rest of him's
probably out there

02:00.203 --> 02:02.288
At least we have a hand

02:03.623 --> 02:06.209
So let me ask you a question

02:06.209 --> 02:10.128
You find human body
parts in a shark

02:10.713 --> 02:12.798
... is that murder?

02:13.049 --> 02:15.092
It is when we're looking for lead

03:10.305 --> 03:12.891
I think we're going to need
a bigger body bag

03:12.891 --> 03:15.268
If anybody can find one,
it's you, Alexx

03:15.268 --> 03:16.978
You got that right

03:17.228 --> 03:18.229
All right, fellas

03:18.229 --> 03:20.315
You heard the man. Bag him

03:20.315 --> 03:21.316
My shark now

03:21.316 --> 03:24.569
I'm off to ruin a captain's day

03:27.405 --> 03:29.324
Everything is nautical, I get it

03:29.324 --> 03:31.534
What I want to know is,
did you mark the catch?

03:31.534 --> 03:33.203
Ten foot tiger shark?

03:33.203 --> 03:34.371
You bet your ass

03:34.871 --> 03:37.624
nd that ten-foot tiger shark
is now property

03:37.624 --> 03:40.377
of the Miami-Dade crime lab

03:40.377 --> 03:42.379
And by the way what kind
of a global positioner is that?

03:42.379 --> 03:43.922
I've got precise positioning

03:43.922 --> 03:45.548
if that's what you're asking

03:45.548 --> 03:47.717
"Precise positioning"?
How'd you get that?

03:47.717 --> 03:48.551
The government?

03:48.551 --> 03:49.719
I got friends

03:49.719 --> 03:51.596
I called in a couple of favors

03:51.596 --> 03:53.848
Lucky for us

03:56.434 --> 03:59.270
You got Miami,
Grand Bahamas, Cuba

03:59.270 --> 04:00.897
About a hundred and
seventy miles total distance

04:00.897 --> 04:02.232
We hooked in right here,
fourteen miles out

04:02.524 --> 04:03.525
About a hundred and
seventy miles total distance

04:03.525 --> 04:05.151
We hooked in right here,
fourteen miles out

04:05.151 --> 04:06.319
About what time was that?

04:06.319 --> 04:08.029
8:30 this morning

04:08.029 --> 04:08.988
Mm-hmm

04:09.239 --> 04:10.490
I shark fish

04:10.490 --> 04:11.741
I used to shark fish all the time

04:11.741 --> 04:13.326
I've never gone out in the day

04:13.326 --> 04:14.703
Yeah, well, we got a late start

04:14.703 --> 04:16.329
There was a squall line
pushing through

04:16.329 --> 04:18.498
We couldn't chum or
lay out any lines till sunrise

04:18.498 --> 04:20.166
I'm gonna take this chart,
too, if you don't mind

04:20.375 --> 04:21.209
Wait a minute

04:21.500 --> 04:23.002
First you take my client's shark

04:23.002 --> 04:25.046
then you take my chart?

04:25.046 --> 04:26.381
What do I get?

04:26.381 --> 04:31.136
You get a pass on
your illegal GPS unit

04:55.035 --> 04:58.079
Twenty-eight pounds,
seven ounces

04:58.079 --> 05:00.248
Boy or a girl, Alexx?

05:00.457 --> 05:02.292
Don't rush me

05:05.545 --> 05:06.755
Hmm.  Gynecomastia

05:06.755 --> 05:07.922
Enlarged breast

05:08.131 --> 05:10.383
Would signify female,
but could also be male

05:10.383 --> 05:11.926
No armpit hair

05:11.926 --> 05:14.596
but pronounced hair
on the knuckles

05:14.596 --> 05:16.514
So what are you saying?

05:16.765 --> 05:19.309
What I'm saying is,
I'm not an anthropologist

05:19.309 --> 05:21.019
Could be a big woman
or a small man

05:22.771 --> 05:24.606
Let's get your DNA

05:37.577 --> 05:40.997
Stippling and some
GSR inside the wound

05:40.997 --> 05:43.666
The shot was fired at close range

05:46.086 --> 05:47.003
Que fue?

05:47.003 --> 05:49.255
Ha.  Lovely.
I just got a look at that

05:49.255 --> 05:51.299
tiger shark in the cooler

05:51.299 --> 05:54.260
Liberal eaters, like Speedle

05:54.260 --> 05:56.346
They'll eat anything as
long as it's alive

05:56.346 --> 05:57.514
Alexx?

05:57.514 --> 05:58.681
I heard

06:00.058 --> 06:03.520
Dermal ecchymosis
around the teeth marks

06:03.520 --> 06:07.565
Capillaries inside the deltoid
muscle are hemorrhagic

06:07.857 --> 06:10.819
Blood was circulating at
the time of the injury

06:10.819 --> 06:13.571
That was like ringing the dinner bell

06:13.571 --> 06:15.657
Two thirds of the tiger sharks brain

06:15.907 --> 06:17.992
is dedicated to processing scent

06:25.542 --> 06:27.585
Alexx, how long do you think the victim

06:27.585 --> 06:29.254
was in the shark's stomach?

06:29.254 --> 06:31.005
Well,  I'll have to test the levels of

06:31.214 --> 06:32.674
regurgitative enzymes

06:32.924 --> 06:35.510
Yeah,  sharks regurgitate
anything that they can't digest

06:35.510 --> 06:37.846
Hmm. Like human bones

06:41.599 --> 06:42.767
And metal

06:45.103 --> 06:47.939
Would you give me a times
eight on this tattoo?

06:50.859 --> 06:51.735
Interesting tat

06:51.735 --> 06:52.444
Hmm

06:52.694 --> 06:53.737
Upside-down flag

06:53.737 --> 06:56.990
Yes, that is the international
symbol for distress, isn't it?

06:56.990 --> 06:58.074
And note the fish

06:58.450 --> 06:59.784
It is the ancient symbol

06:59.784 --> 07:01.703
for Christian resistance

07:02.037 --> 07:03.621
Catholic leaders in Cuba also used it

07:03.621 --> 07:05.915
for the anti-Castro rebellion

07:05.915 --> 07:10.420
Which would mean that our
vic was a political prisoner

07:10.712 --> 07:15.592
Yup, and it also means that
we could have a political mess

07:16.342 --> 07:17.844
If he was living on U.S. Soil

07:17.844 --> 07:19.512
he  would have been
processed at Krome detention

07:19.512 --> 07:21.181
And his prints would be on file

07:21.181 --> 07:23.433
But if he was on his way here,
we've got nothing

07:24.684 --> 07:25.477
He was making his way, though

07:25.477 --> 07:27.395
He probably wasn't swimming

07:27.645 --> 07:28.104
Boat?

07:28.104 --> 07:30.398
That would be my guess. Speed?

07:30.398 --> 07:31.941
What have you got?

07:34.569 --> 07:35.653
Well ... he was from Cuba

07:35.653 --> 07:36.821
and he was making a freedom run

07:36.821 --> 07:39.032
Okay, hang on.
You're way ahead of us

07:39.032 --> 07:41.451
Well, based on where
the shark was caught

07:41.451 --> 07:42.535
and simple geography

07:42.535 --> 07:44.496
it's a straight shot from Matanzas

07:44.496 --> 07:46.122
or Villa Clara to Miami

07:46.122 --> 07:48.541
You know what that means?

07:49.167 --> 07:49.751
Elian

07:49.751 --> 07:51.461
Our, uh, victim

07:51.461 --> 07:52.587
wasn't on the boat alone

07:52.587 --> 07:54.672
Okay.  So, Speed,
call the coast guard

07:54.672 --> 07:56.549
make a friend,
and take Eric with you

07:56.883 --> 07:57.592
Aye, aye

08:02.180 --> 08:03.598
You got something for me?

08:03.598 --> 08:05.308
I got a question

08:05.308 --> 08:06.142
Shoot

08:06.643 --> 08:08.103
How old are you?

08:09.270 --> 08:10.772
Hmm. 45. Caliber round, right?

08:12.065 --> 08:14.025
- See the rifling characteristics?
- I do

08:14.025 --> 08:15.985
Now I've got a question for you

08:16.236 --> 08:16.945
Shoot

08:17.153 --> 08:18.363
Do you think that's a Colt?

08:18.363 --> 08:19.155
I do

08:19.364 --> 08:20.907
So do I

08:30.959 --> 08:32.126
This guy was in a hurry

08:32.460 --> 08:34.003
Are you kidding?
Look at that boat

08:34.003 --> 08:35.380
How are you doing?
Eric Delko

08:35.630 --> 08:36.965
Tim Speedle, CSI Miami

08:36.965 --> 08:38.133
Martin, U.S. Coast Guard

08:38.133 --> 08:39.509
We got your call

08:39.509 --> 08:41.177
Got four birds out there
doing coastline patrol

08:41.177 --> 08:43.221
Got a chopper on an
insurance job called it in

08:43.221 --> 08:45.765
What kind of boat are
you guys looking for?

08:45.765 --> 08:47.934
The kind that has blood in it

09:06.036 --> 09:08.621
I got tracks

09:10.206 --> 09:11.750
South side tire's bald

09:22.719 --> 09:26.306
Boat's missing its hull
identification number

09:36.107 --> 09:37.901
Freedom run gone wrong

09:51.498 --> 09:53.291
This didn't work too good

09:54.918 --> 09:56.211
Inhaler

09:56.628 --> 09:58.046
Empty

09:58.880 --> 10:01.174
Artifacts and abandonment

10:02.217 --> 10:04.177
What do you think, Tim?

10:04.177 --> 10:05.637
Feel suspicious?

10:24.739 --> 10:26.241
Hey, Speedle

10:26.866 --> 10:28.451
What do you think you
can do with this?

10:28.451 --> 10:31.204
What, here or back at the lab?

10:36.251 --> 10:37.794
This boat's got a filling

10:38.253 --> 10:40.255
Oh, yeah? What caliber?

10:42.882 --> 10:43.883
Well ...

10:44.634 --> 10:46.678
that's for Calleigh

10:46.886 --> 10:47.929
Hmm

10:49.723 --> 10:52.392
This could be our crime scene

10:52.767 --> 10:54.769
That could be fish blood

10:56.855 --> 10:59.733
And that ... is for Megan

11:19.127 --> 11:21.004
Bullet from the torso

11:21.004 --> 11:22.172
on the left

11:22.172 --> 11:24.466
Bullet from the boat on the right

11:24.466 --> 11:26.968
Two hearts beat as one

11:26.968 --> 11:28.678
Both .45 caliber classic

11:28.678 --> 11:30.305
classic copper jacketed six lands

11:30.305 --> 11:32.599
and groves with a left-hand twist

11:32.891 --> 11:34.684
I've got a twist for you

11:35.310 --> 11:36.644
The blood from the boat:

11:36.644 --> 11:37.645
human

11:37.645 --> 11:41.441
Matches our torso,
who was definitely X-Y.  Male

11:41.441 --> 11:42.609
But John Doe was on that boat

11:42.609 --> 11:44.152
Where's the twist?

11:44.152 --> 11:45.820
Flesh tissue on the bullet
Speedle recovered

11:46.404 --> 11:47.822
from the boat?  X-X

11:56.498 --> 12:01.086
We ... have another victim
out there, ladies

12:10.510 --> 12:12.470
Let's hope he didn't sand
down the impression

12:12.470 --> 12:15.014
Yeah, if he was a pro,
we got nothing

12:15.014 --> 12:16.140
I'm gonna try a little heat separation

12:16.140 --> 12:17.183
see if I can't find

12:17.183 --> 12:18.351
something under the peel

12:18.351 --> 12:19.811
Sounds like a good idea

12:20.061 --> 12:22.563
This boat looks like it went
through Hurricane Andrew

12:22.563 --> 12:25.233
This boat has enough
horsepower in it

12:25.233 --> 12:27.902
to have outrun Andrew

12:29.696 --> 12:32.281
Maybe we're running at night

12:32.281 --> 12:34.409
Never saw the squall coming

12:38.037 --> 12:38.830
Speed!

12:38.830 --> 12:39.747
Yeah?

12:39.747 --> 12:41.582
What does it say on the stern?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.293
Luna Nueva

12:44.293 --> 12:45.420
Moon New

12:45.628 --> 12:46.671
It's "new moon."

12:46.671 --> 12:48.131
Moon cycle, gentlemen

12:48.131 --> 12:49.799
It goes from first quarter to full

12:49.799 --> 12:51.426
then three-quarters

12:51.426 --> 12:52.176
to new

12:54.345 --> 12:56.347
Which means no moon

13:01.728 --> 13:03.229
I'm out

13:06.774 --> 13:08.025
What was that?

13:08.025 --> 13:09.444
What?

13:09.777 --> 13:11.154
Do what you just did again

13:11.362 --> 13:13.239
There you go

13:13.239 --> 13:16.951
Well, that's a sound that
doesn't belong on a boat

13:27.086 --> 13:28.129
Walls like that

13:28.129 --> 13:29.756
take a lot of work to build

13:29.756 --> 13:31.466
There's only one reason

13:31.466 --> 13:33.259
to build a hold like that, my friend

13:33.259 --> 13:34.719
and that is to stash your stash

13:34.719 --> 13:37.430
You can run with at least five
hundred keys in there

13:42.685 --> 13:45.855
It's like Capone's vault, empty

13:46.230 --> 13:47.857
Those are your eyes talking

13:48.316 --> 13:49.734
Look harder

14:02.580 --> 14:04.415
We got something

14:04.415 --> 14:05.124
hmm

14:28.689 --> 14:30.066
That's cocaine

14:33.361 --> 14:35.113
Why fill in the number?

14:35.113 --> 14:37.407
Why not just sand it all
the way down?

14:37.865 --> 14:38.908
I don't know

14:38.908 --> 14:40.660
Maybe it's a guy thing

14:40.660 --> 14:43.162
What?  They'll add on or cover up

14:43.162 --> 14:45.289
but they won't mess up
the chassis?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.459
You know what?
You're scaring me

14:50.878 --> 14:52.797
Okay, we manipulate the pixels

14:52.797 --> 14:55.049
in gray scale and ...

14:55.717 --> 14:58.177
The hull was built in 1972

14:58.428 --> 14:59.512
Do you want to do this?

14:59.512 --> 15:00.054
No

15:00.638 --> 15:02.140
It's a guy thing

15:02.140 --> 15:05.852
It's just that Megan wanted
it ten minutes ago

15:20.950 --> 15:21.951
You beep me?

15:21.951 --> 15:24.245
- Was it 411?
- Yeah

15:24.245 --> 15:25.371
Means I've got info

15:25.371 --> 15:26.873
Your hull ID number ...

15:26.873 --> 15:28.666
got us a registration and a name

15:28.666 --> 15:30.376
Captain Robert Morton

15:30.376 --> 15:31.461
Captain Bob

15:31.461 --> 15:32.879
Talked to the marina manager

15:33.087 --> 15:34.839
Did he give you anything?

15:34.839 --> 15:35.965
A migraine

15:36.174 --> 15:38.843
Said as long as the Captain's
check clears every month

15:38.843 --> 15:40.428
he's the second cousin
to Peter Rabbit

15:40.428 --> 15:41.929
So he knows nothing on the guy

15:41.929 --> 15:43.014
You got it

15:43.014 --> 15:44.182
Find a seat, get comfortable

15:44.390 --> 15:46.851
I want you to watch every
frame for the last two days

15:46.851 --> 15:48.978
See if the captain shows his face

15:51.439 --> 15:52.565
Did, uh, did you clear this with H?

15:52.565 --> 15:54.400
'Cause I'm supposed to be
working on the note

15:54.400 --> 15:55.693
Don't worry about Horatio

15:55.985 --> 15:57.487
It's unclear if I'm working for him

15:57.487 --> 15:59.113
or I'm working for you

15:59.113 --> 16:00.740
You  work for the victim

16:04.494 --> 16:05.620
Donner

16:06.996 --> 16:08.915
Where's Horatio?

16:09.957 --> 16:11.501
Be right there

16:41.406 --> 16:42.281
Cyrillic lettering

16:42.907 --> 16:45.243
The Russians have been
forever dumping

16:45.243 --> 16:47.412
their second-rate surplus
on their island friends

16:47.412 --> 16:48.538
And in this case, we're talking

16:48.538 --> 16:49.789
about Cuba

16:50.289 --> 16:51.791
This girl's been shot in the leg

16:51.791 --> 16:53.418
Very close to the femoral artery

16:53.418 --> 16:54.627
Bled out

16:54.877 --> 16:56.921
Our female bleeder?

16:56.921 --> 16:58.756
Can you see an exit wound?

17:00.717 --> 17:01.551
No

17:01.551 --> 17:02.760
Interesting  tourniquet

17:02.760 --> 17:04.804
Tied tight

17:04.804 --> 17:06.388
Who tried to save her?

17:09.016 --> 17:11.394
Injury like this, she
would've been dead

17:11.394 --> 17:12.979
in under thirty minutes

17:12.979 --> 17:15.397
There's no evidence
of sunburn or exposure

17:15.397 --> 17:16.858
She didn't float here
all the way, did she?

17:16.858 --> 17:18.192
She was on a boat

17:18.192 --> 17:19.484
Our drug boat?

17:20.028 --> 17:21.319
Could be

17:22.405 --> 17:23.489
Take a look at that

17:23.865 --> 17:25.907
You know what that is?

17:25.907 --> 17:28.786
La caridad del cobre

17:29.037 --> 17:30.580
The virgin of charity

17:30.913 --> 17:31.914
And  the patron Saint of Cuba

17:31.914 --> 17:33.207
I've seen these before

17:33.416 --> 17:34.083
Mm-hmm

17:34.459 --> 17:37.003
Families in Miami send
them to their relatives

17:37.003 --> 17:38.796
as a good luck piece
for the journey

17:38.796 --> 17:41.007
That's right, and that ninety
miles of open ocean

17:41.007 --> 17:42.383
will take that good luck
away from you

17:42.383 --> 17:43.509
in two seconds

17:44.093 --> 17:45.928
This is made custom, by hand

17:47.513 --> 17:48.848
Old school ...

17:48.848 --> 17:50.641
with a palm push graver

17:54.312 --> 17:55.855
Tonal variations ...

17:55.855 --> 17:57.732
there's only one or two
guys in Little Havana

17:57.732 --> 17:59.108
who do this bulino work

17:59.108 --> 18:02.320
And not one of them is
going to help us with this

18:17.543 --> 18:19.337
Wet foot, dry foot

18:20.922 --> 18:23.508
All a Cuban immigrant has to
do is touch U.S. soil

18:23.508 --> 18:25.134
and they're here

18:25.134 --> 18:26.677
Unless, of course

18:26.886 --> 18:31.224
the coast guard picks you
up out there on the water

18:31.557 --> 18:33.601
and sends you back to Fidel

18:35.978 --> 18:37.522
If she made it to dry land
she'd have gone through

18:37.522 --> 18:39.273
seventy-two hours of processing

18:39.273 --> 18:41.901
and walked with a green card

18:42.735 --> 18:45.154
She almost made it

18:45.154 --> 18:47.990
She didn't count on getting shot

18:49.367 --> 18:51.452
Ready to play politics?

19:00.586 --> 19:01.587
Bueno, quien juega?

19:01.587 --> 19:02.839
De que tenemos este honor?

19:11.347 --> 19:12.640
Pero quiero saber...

19:15.518 --> 19:16.519
Buenos dias, Senores

19:16.769 --> 19:17.770
Senor Caine

19:18.062 --> 19:18.771
Rolando, por favor

19:19.188 --> 19:19.981
Gracias

19:20.189 --> 19:21.649
A que le debemos este honor?

19:23.860 --> 19:24.861
Basilio ...

19:25.778 --> 19:27.864
bodies are washing up on shore

19:29.907 --> 19:30.992
They wash up all the time

19:31.200 --> 19:32.368
The government doesn't care about

19:32.618 --> 19:33.828
a balsero

19:34.120 --> 19:35.121
Balsera ...

19:35.371 --> 19:36.998
in this case

19:39.667 --> 19:40.668
Nice work

19:40.877 --> 19:42.420
She was wearing it

19:44.130 --> 19:45.423
I'm sorry to hear that

19:45.423 --> 19:46.466
Basilio ...

19:46.466 --> 19:49.552
the last thing this town
needs is to blow up

19:49.552 --> 19:50.595
and you know that

19:50.595 --> 19:52.472
I need your help on this

19:53.389 --> 19:54.766
What's so special about this girl?

19:54.974 --> 19:56.392
She was shot to death

20:00.146 --> 20:02.190
This necklace can only get us so far

20:02.190 --> 20:04.859
All it has to do is get us inside

20:04.859 --> 20:05.610
Horatio, please

20:13.117 --> 20:14.410
So, Senor Caine

20:14.952 --> 20:18.831
Senorita Donner,
are you police officers?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.541
Well, actually, Senor ...

20:21.167 --> 20:24.337
we're Crime Scene Investigators

20:24.337 --> 20:26.047
And I'd like to show you something

20:26.047 --> 20:27.548
to see if

20:27.799 --> 20:29.300
it has any meaning to you

20:52.156 --> 20:55.243
The price of freedom for
Cuban children is high

20:56.285 --> 20:57.995
but worth it

20:58.329 --> 20:59.706
Ramon Grau

21:00.373 --> 21:02.291
Spent two decades
in Fidel's prisons

21:02.667 --> 21:04.210
for arranging safe passage

21:04.669 --> 21:06.963
for thousands of Cuban
kids to the States

21:06.963 --> 21:08.548
I know who he is

21:08.798 --> 21:10.717
Fourteen thousand forty-eight
children to be exact

21:10.717 --> 21:12.969
You're one of Ramon's kids

21:14.679 --> 21:15.471
Tia

21:19.016 --> 21:20.351
Who's that?

21:20.601 --> 21:22.937
My nephew Pedro

21:28.901 --> 21:30.403
Can I speak to him?

21:30.403 --> 21:31.738
We promised you five minutes

21:31.738 --> 21:32.905
It's been five minutes

21:32.905 --> 21:34.032
Finito.  No mas

21:34.032 --> 21:34.907
Hemos terminado

21:34.907 --> 21:37.118
Basilio  I still need somebody to
come down to the morgue

21:37.118 --> 21:38.327
to identify the body

21:38.619 --> 21:41.539
I will make all arrangements personally

21:42.206 --> 21:43.541
Give me a second

21:48.087 --> 21:51.549
Yo perdi a mi esposo recien

21:52.091 --> 21:53.634
I'm very sorry

21:53.926 --> 21:55.595
I'm sorry, too

22:00.725 --> 22:03.394
Her name was Elena

22:05.730 --> 22:07.565
She was my niece

22:11.694 --> 22:13.237
Por favor

22:15.198 --> 22:16.741
We should go

22:20.536 --> 22:21.621
So sorry

22:22.205 --> 22:23.748
Gracias

22:37.845 --> 22:38.846
Horatio

22:39.347 --> 22:40.264
Yes?

22:42.892 --> 22:44.352
Those are my people in there

22:44.352 --> 22:46.354
I meant no disrespect, Basilio

22:46.646 --> 22:48.564
This family is in mourning

22:48.773 --> 22:50.274
And this is not an interrogation

22:50.274 --> 22:52.402
We were up front about our intentions

22:52.610 --> 22:54.153
You cannot go to the well and drink it dry

22:54.153 --> 22:56.280
We need to speak to that boy

22:56.280 --> 22:58.741
And we'll get a warrant if we have to

22:59.367 --> 23:01.577
Us Cubans are a proud people

23:01.577 --> 23:02.787
Que no?

23:04.247 --> 23:05.123
Nos vemos

23:05.707 --> 23:07.125
Amigo

23:15.425 --> 23:16.467
Basilio

23:17.260 --> 23:18.803
Buenos tardes

23:26.851 --> 23:28.895
Horatio, heard you hit
some kind of dead end

23:28.895 --> 23:29.687
You heard right

23:29.687 --> 23:31.314
Just finished the post on the girl

23:31.314 --> 23:33.316
I want to hear about it.
Hang on one second

23:33.316 --> 23:34.859
Calleigh, the bullet?
I'm working on it

23:34.859 --> 23:36.319
- Let me know
- Who community beeped?

23:36.319 --> 23:36.986
That was me

23:36.986 --> 23:38.696
How are we coming along on the note?

23:38.696 --> 23:41.115
Uh, we're not coming

23:41.115 --> 23:42.825
What do you mean?

23:42.825 --> 23:45.495
I pulled Speedle off the note
for the surveillance footage

23:45.495 --> 23:47.080
My call, not his

23:47.080 --> 23:48.790
Finish up on that,
get back on the note

23:48.790 --> 23:50.083
Any DNA on that rope?

23:50.083 --> 23:51.376
In the works

23:51.626 --> 23:52.669
Let me know

23:52.669 --> 23:54.671
Eric, roam and assist, please

23:54.921 --> 23:56.172
You got it

23:56.381 --> 23:57.715
Okay, Alexx, talk to me

23:57.715 --> 23:58.758
The girl ?

23:58.758 --> 24:00.009
Her name is Elena de Soto

24:00.009 --> 24:01.177
Any GSR or stippling?

24:01.177 --> 24:03.388
Yes, and there was something strange

24:03.388 --> 24:04.389
inside the wound track

24:04.389 --> 24:05.515
Found traces of a

24:05.515 --> 24:07.225
synthetic-based material

24:07.225 --> 24:08.643
Not a match to her clothing

24:08.643 --> 24:09.769
- It's at trace
- Is that it ?

24:10.395 --> 24:12.730
She had significant levels
of albuteral in her system

24:12.730 --> 24:13.856
She was asthmatic

24:13.856 --> 24:16.067
We found an inhaler on the boat

24:16.067 --> 24:17.277
My guess?

24:17.277 --> 24:20.488
Bronchospasms triggered
by some kind of stress

24:20.488 --> 24:22.574
My guess is she overmedicated

24:28.746 --> 24:31.082
Her heart went into dysrhythmia

24:31.332 --> 24:33.626
a condition that doesn't go
well with a severed femoral

24:34.085 --> 24:37.213
The tourniquet didn't
buy her a lot of time

24:37.881 --> 24:38.590
Okay

24:38.798 --> 24:39.549
Good

25:07.994 --> 25:08.786
Come on in

25:09.037 --> 25:11.164
You ought to give me the
name of your decorator

25:11.164 --> 25:12.582
Well, it's just a phone

25:12.582 --> 25:14.375
and a desk when
we're not in the field

25:14.918 --> 25:16.628
Any word on the captain?

25:16.628 --> 25:18.671
The detectives still have it,
we're waiting

25:18.671 --> 25:19.839
What do you got?

25:19.839 --> 25:21.716
DNA results from the skin cells

25:21.716 --> 25:24.052
we collected off
Elena De Soto's rope

25:24.052 --> 25:25.637
Somebody else tied that tourniquet

25:25.637 --> 25:26.763
Well, we knew that

25:26.763 --> 25:28.640
No, we know that now

25:28.640 --> 25:30.308
There's significant
commonality in the markers

25:30.308 --> 25:32.227
You think it's a family member?

25:32.227 --> 25:33.937
Maybe the guy in the back bedroom

25:33.937 --> 25:36.147
What about a first cousin?

25:36.147 --> 25:37.398
Closer

25:38.441 --> 25:40.485
I'm thinking brother

25:41.945 --> 25:43.488
Hey, Calleigh

25:43.488 --> 25:45.114
Listen, I was wondering

25:45.114 --> 25:47.450
if maybe I could crash
at your place tonight

25:48.201 --> 25:50.453
I'm trying to keep a low profile

25:50.453 --> 25:52.789
and H has been stirring up
the neighborhood

25:53.248 --> 25:55.708
You know how he is,
he's like a dog with a bone

25:55.708 --> 25:57.335
Yeah, well, he needs
to learn how to let go

25:57.335 --> 25:59.003
'Cause this girl's family doesn't care

25:59.003 --> 26:00.129
about solving the crime

26:00.129 --> 26:01.339
Their niece is already dead

26:01.339 --> 26:04.008
You know, they're thinking we
got to protect the living

26:04.008 --> 26:06.636
I can't say I blame them

26:12.183 --> 26:13.268
On the couch

26:13.518 --> 26:15.562
No midnight tiptoe Deal?

26:15.562 --> 26:16.563
Deal

26:18.231 --> 26:19.774
Check this out

26:21.985 --> 26:24.320
Bullet on the left,

26:24.696 --> 26:27.448
Elena De Soto's leg
Bullet on the right, from John Doe torso

26:28.199 --> 26:29.742
They're twins

26:30.201 --> 26:31.744
They're triplets

26:31.744 --> 26:33.371
They also match the bullet

26:33.371 --> 26:35.582
you guys pulled out of
the Luna Nueva

26:37.208 --> 26:39.794
It must've been some
massacre on that boat

26:47.594 --> 26:50.179
Did your parents make that journey?

26:50.179 --> 26:52.307
Actually, we all did

26:53.516 --> 26:56.060
I was in my mother's belly

27:05.028 --> 27:05.737
Yo

27:07.238 --> 27:07.947
Yo

27:08.489 --> 27:09.741
What's this?

27:11.367 --> 27:12.285
Megan

27:14.329 --> 27:15.830
Still ?

27:15.830 --> 27:16.998
Yep

27:17.916 --> 27:20.710
And you're watching it in real time?

27:22.962 --> 27:24.464
You see that rental truck there

27:24.714 --> 27:26.841
the one next to the Luna Nueva slip?

27:27.133 --> 27:29.052
It's been parked there

27:29.302 --> 27:32.430
for six hours and
twenty-three minutes

27:33.181 --> 27:34.974
You see the driver?

27:35.934 --> 27:37.435
Not a cup of coffee

27:37.727 --> 27:39.646
doesn't have to take a leak

27:40.313 --> 27:41.105
Nothing

27:42.357 --> 27:44.943
What's he waiting around for?

27:46.027 --> 27:51.241
Well, If H is right, that hull can
hold five hundred kilos of blow

27:51.616 --> 27:53.868
That's a lot of reasons to wait around

27:53.868 --> 27:55.745
Five hundred reasons, gentlemen

27:55.745 --> 27:58.248
Speed, get me in closer

28:00.041 --> 28:02.085
All right, zoom in on those back tires

28:06.047 --> 28:08.424
Now, does that tire look
bald to you or not?

28:08.716 --> 28:09.551
Mm-hmm

28:09.968 --> 28:12.387
Let's find this truck

28:28.778 --> 28:30.530
Yes, I am up on the current software

28:30.530 --> 28:32.073
I didn't say anything

28:32.073 --> 28:34.033
Oh, you don't have to

28:34.033 --> 28:36.244
Interesting material

28:36.244 --> 28:39.038
I found in Elena's wound track is olefin

28:39.038 --> 28:41.165
Which is a synthetic fiber

28:41.416 --> 28:43.001
What makes it interesting

28:43.001 --> 28:45.295
is that she was wearing
a cotton dress

28:45.295 --> 28:47.171
John Doe was wearing olefin

28:47.171 --> 28:48.965
Yes, he was

28:48.965 --> 28:50.174
Which give us

28:50.174 --> 28:52.093
a possible series of events

28:52.302 --> 28:53.511
Let's say John Doe

28:53.511 --> 28:55.555
... was shot first
The bullet penetrated his shirt

28:55.555 --> 28:57.724
from point blank range

28:57.974 --> 29:00.226
and some of the material from his shirt

29:00.226 --> 29:01.895
was sucked back into the barrel

29:01.895 --> 29:05.023
That means that the next round fired

29:05.023 --> 29:07.150
would carry that material
into Elena's thigh, right?

29:09.569 --> 29:11.654
We've already got a match
on all three bullets

29:11.946 --> 29:14.949
putting John Doe and
Elena on that boat

29:15.241 --> 29:17.493
The epithelials from the tourniquet

29:17.493 --> 29:19.579
tell us someone
closely related to her

29:19.829 --> 29:22.040
Someone closely related,
like her brother Pedro

29:23.082 --> 29:25.084
He could've tied that tourniquet

29:25.084 --> 29:26.252
Close relatives

29:26.252 --> 29:27.420
travel together

29:30.590 --> 29:34.219
A DNA match makes
him a material witness

29:34.219 --> 29:37.305
And that is a warrant we can get

30:07.627 --> 30:08.169
Hey

30:11.089 --> 30:12.298
The only place in the country

30:12.298 --> 30:14.300
you have to negotiate
with the community

30:14.300 --> 30:16.344
before you serve the warrant

30:16.344 --> 30:17.845
Let's go

30:26.145 --> 30:27.021
Hola, Pedro

30:28.690 --> 30:30.567
Yo me llamo Adell Sevilla

30:30.567 --> 30:35.321
Estos Senores aqui van a
revisar tu cuarto Por favor,

30:35.572 --> 30:37.532
acompaname

32:02.200 --> 32:04.786
We can just ask for a swab

32:09.499 --> 32:10.917
Hold the phone

32:20.677 --> 32:22.428
Colt 45

32:26.140 --> 32:27.684
Let's take him in

32:27.684 --> 32:29.686
Hands behind your back

32:37.033 --> 32:38.660
Detectives found the rental truck

32:38.660 --> 32:40.829
and the Captain at Miami International

32:40.829 --> 32:42.455
They're both are in custody

32:42.789 --> 32:43.832
Yes sir

32:44.040 --> 32:44.958
I will

32:55.802 --> 32:58.096
Coke wrapping must have
picked up some blood

32:58.096 --> 33:00.348
when it was being
loaded off of the boat

33:04.310 --> 33:06.771
Locard's Theory.
Primary transfer

33:06.771 --> 33:08.857
Kind of like going to the bathroom

33:08.857 --> 33:11.109
You can never wipe enough

33:27.709 --> 33:28.710
Horatio

33:28.710 --> 33:30.211
I like that tone

33:30.420 --> 33:31.379
That's an affirmative on the 45

33:31.379 --> 33:33.715
It's the source of all three bullets

33:33.715 --> 33:34.549
Okay

33:34.758 --> 33:36.217
Doesn't that mean we have the guy?

33:36.217 --> 33:38.219
Well, you tell me

33:39.763 --> 33:40.889
You make a run for freedom

33:40.889 --> 33:42.724
you shoot your sister along the way

33:42.724 --> 33:44.851
and then you try to save her life

33:44.851 --> 33:47.187
See, this is why I like ballistics

33:47.187 --> 33:49.063
It's an exact science

33:49.314 --> 33:49.814
Mm

33:58.406 --> 33:59.240
Just takes a sec

34:05.872 --> 34:11.002
The software digitizes the diluted ink pattern

34:11.002 --> 34:13.545
And the algorithm

34:13.545 --> 34:16.757
extrapolates a reversal probability

34:16.757 --> 34:18.885
estimating an image of the original writing

34:19.094 --> 34:19.594
Hmmm

34:23.139 --> 34:24.014
NM28-30

34:26.059 --> 34:28.228
But does it crack the code?

34:28.228 --> 34:31.940
Yeah, it just gives you the puzzle,
it doesn't solve it

34:32.815 --> 34:34.609
Got to crack the code

34:49.623 --> 34:50.625
Que pasa?

34:51.333 --> 34:53.210
Why start shooting?

34:55.045 --> 34:56.047
Stay with me for a minute

34:56.047 --> 34:56.840
Okay

34:56.840 --> 35:00.135
We catalogued all the
personal property on this boat

35:00.135 --> 35:04.472
The shoes, the hairbrushes,
the glasses, the clothing

35:04.472 --> 35:07.267
we've evidence there were
at least twelve people on that boat

35:07.267 --> 35:08.351
Could've been more

35:08.351 --> 35:09.644
Who we do know about

35:09.644 --> 35:12.647
is Captain Bob, Elena,
Pedro, John Doe

35:12.647 --> 35:16.109
and an unidentified
female gunshot victim

35:16.109 --> 35:19.320
Anybody else would have
drowned in the gulf stream

35:19.320 --> 35:20.780
never to be seen again, right?

35:20.780 --> 35:22.657
Average a 150 pounds per person

35:22.657 --> 35:24.826
that's 1,800 pounds,
all near the stern

35:25.034 --> 35:27.120
A thousand pounds of
coke in the right hull

35:27.370 --> 35:29.789
This boat's center of gravity
would have been way off

35:30.832 --> 35:34.794
Seven-foot seas, they were taking
on water in the fishhold

35:34.794 --> 35:37.547
That would panic the
captain, wouldn't it?

35:49.768 --> 35:51.770
He had a decision to make

35:51.770 --> 35:54.397
Save his passengers
or save his drugs

35:55.190 --> 35:56.441
Hey!  Everybody off!

35:56.441 --> 35:58.443
Everybody get off the boat
or we're all going down!

35:59.652 --> 36:02.155
So, if he said jump, would you?

36:02.155 --> 36:05.033
If he had a gun to my head

36:05.033 --> 36:07.243
Let's go put one to his

36:08.953 --> 36:10.455
My boat can't be missing

36:10.455 --> 36:11.790
if I know where it is

36:11.998 --> 36:14.084
Where do you think it is?

36:14.084 --> 36:16.795
I got blindsided by a storm
a couple of nights ago

36:17.045 --> 36:18.421
Had to ditch it south of
Matheson Hammock

36:18.797 --> 36:20.298
We towed it for you

36:20.590 --> 36:22.133
It's out back

36:22.383 --> 36:25.303
Evidence in criminal investigation

36:25.720 --> 36:27.263
Somebody stole it?

36:27.263 --> 36:29.974
Captain Bob, are you
aware that it's a crime

36:30.183 --> 36:33.269
in the State of Florida to build a
secret compartment in a boat

36:33.269 --> 36:37.023
or a car even if the
compartment is empty?

36:37.774 --> 36:38.858
What's the fine?

36:39.150 --> 36:40.443
For trafficking?

36:40.443 --> 36:42.904
I don't know the words to that
song you want me to sing

36:43.154 --> 36:44.197
You own a gun?

36:45.532 --> 36:46.366
Yeah

36:46.616 --> 36:47.951
Where is your gun?

36:49.744 --> 36:52.705
Someone stole it off my boat
a couple of months ago

36:52.705 --> 36:54.374
We have your gun

36:54.707 --> 36:57.377
and we now have your truck

36:57.669 --> 37:01.297
We matched your gun to bullets
we found in two dead bodies

37:01.297 --> 37:04.884
We have evidence of
pure cocaine in your boat

37:04.884 --> 37:06.803
and your rental truck

37:06.803 --> 37:08.930
I think you were trafficking cocaine

37:08.930 --> 37:10.598
into South Florida

37:10.598 --> 37:13.560
got greedy and picked up some
immigrants for extra cash

37:14.144 --> 37:19.065
The thing that you didn't
count on was the storm

37:20.900 --> 37:21.901
Everybody off!

37:22.110 --> 37:24.612
Everybody get off or
we're all going down!

37:40.128 --> 37:41.671
- I want a lawyer
- Hmmm

37:44.966 --> 37:46.426
My dime

37:51.598 --> 37:53.683
Ah, Captain Bob should
have Pedro's lawyer

37:53.683 --> 37:55.393
Might have half a chance

37:55.393 --> 37:56.728
Marin Diaz?
The Cuban Johnnie Cochran

37:56.728 --> 37:58.646
Mm How'd he get him on?

37:58.646 --> 38:00.023
Care to venture a guess?

38:00.023 --> 38:01.065
Basilio?

38:01.065 --> 38:03.443
Ha, there's debt in every favor

38:03.443 --> 38:05.028
Wish me luck

38:05.487 --> 38:06.071
Mm-hmm

38:06.905 --> 38:07.906
Gentlemen

38:08.490 --> 38:09.783
May I?

38:09.783 --> 38:11.159
Be kind, Horatio

38:11.159 --> 38:13.703
As always, Marin

38:13.703 --> 38:15.205
Now, Pedro

38:16.998 --> 38:20.210
The gun that we found in your room

38:20.210 --> 38:23.171
has tied you to two murders

38:23.171 --> 38:26.007
Possession doesn't
make my client a killer

38:26.007 --> 38:28.343
We also have your skin cells
on the tourniquet you used

38:28.760 --> 38:30.053
Allegedly used

38:30.303 --> 38:33.848
Allegedly used to save
your sister's life

38:34.224 --> 38:35.850
Now, are you going to
rebut everything

38:35.850 --> 38:37.227
I'm saying?

38:37.227 --> 38:37.811
Yes

38:38.061 --> 38:38.645
Excellent

38:41.689 --> 38:42.982
Pedro

38:43.566 --> 38:44.651
habla me

38:47.028 --> 38:49.572
You know what that is, don't you?

38:51.699 --> 38:54.619
Now, it was never
door-to-door service

38:54.619 --> 38:55.912
Pedro, you don't have to
answer the questions

38:55.912 --> 38:57.497
The way it works is,

38:57.497 --> 38:59.624
you get dropped off as soon
as you see the lights of Miami

38:59.624 --> 39:01.793
but that night there was
a storm, wasn't there?

39:01.793 --> 39:03.753
And the Captain's boat
was taking on water

39:03.753 --> 39:05.463
He took out a gun

39:05.463 --> 39:07.257
and ordered everybody off

39:07.257 --> 39:10.009
You refused, and he started shooting

39:10.009 --> 39:11.553
I'm taking my client out of this room

39:11.553 --> 39:14.055
until there's a formal
investigation in place

39:14.055 --> 39:15.598
Whatever you want

39:20.687 --> 39:24.482
Pedro, I know that you tried
to save your sister's life

39:35.076 --> 39:37.454
I know you took the rope
out of the inner tube

39:37.454 --> 39:40.039
and made the tourniquet,
but it didn't work

39:40.039 --> 39:41.541
and she bled to death

39:41.541 --> 39:42.667
before she got ashore,
isn't that true?

39:42.667 --> 39:43.835
Pedro, that's it

39:43.835 --> 39:45.211
We're leaving

39:45.211 --> 39:46.087
No!

39:46.087 --> 39:47.422
We are not leaving

40:10.945 --> 40:12.447
I shot her

40:15.575 --> 40:16.576
Why?

40:17.619 --> 40:20.789
We were floating in the
water for hours

40:23.374 --> 40:26.419
Then we saw the boat

40:41.101 --> 40:42.769
The Coast Guard?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.523
I wanted to get her on that boat

40:47.607 --> 40:54.614
Your law says, if you
need medical attention

40:54.614 --> 40:56.408
you have to be taken to a hospital

40:56.408 --> 40:59.285
You were strong enough
to swim ashore, she wasn't

41:00.120 --> 41:01.788
You shot her in the leg

41:01.788 --> 41:03.456
knowing that if she got picked up

41:03.456 --> 41:05.458
she could stay in America

41:05.458 --> 41:08.169
I did what I had to do

42:50.188 --> 42:53.108
I did what I had to do...

43:09.457 --> 43:11.209
The Coast Guard never saw them

43:11.209 --> 43:13.545
Why'd he keep the gun?

43:13.545 --> 43:14.671
Sharks

43:15.380 --> 43:17.424
So what did the
State Attorney offer him?

43:17.424 --> 43:19.551
Testimony for citizenship

43:20.510 --> 43:21.678
Did he take it?

43:21.886 --> 43:23.930
With a heavy heart

43:24.180 --> 43:25.640
We cracked the code

43:25.640 --> 43:28.893
NM 28 dash 30

43:28.893 --> 43:30.145
New moon

43:30.687 --> 43:31.813
28th to the 30th

43:32.147 --> 43:33.148
End of the month

43:33.523 --> 43:34.816
No light

43:35.024 --> 43:37.235
Here or Havana

43:37.485 --> 43:39.529
Perfect for smuggling

43:43.992 --> 43:49.831
Freedom is Light, though,
isn't it, under any moon?

43:50.165 --> 43:51.207
Well said

43:51.499 --> 43:51.958
Mm

43:54.878 --> 43:55.712
Good night

43:55.962 --> 43:56.755
Good night
