( music )

03:08.922 --> 03:11.959
( cheering )

03:18.299 --> 03:20.801
SHE MAKES IT LOOK
LIKES CHILD'S PLAY,

03:20.901 --> 03:22.503
BUT DON'T BE MISTAKEN.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.473
THAT LETHAL REPTILE
ENCIRCLING HER BODY

03:25.573 --> 03:29.076
COULD KILL HER
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.679
( cheering )

03:40.321 --> 03:44.057
WHAT SAY YOU SHOW
THIS PRETTY SENORITA

03:44.157 --> 03:47.595
YOUR APPRECIATIONS ?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.667

HERE YOU GO, DARLIN'.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.714

JONESY !

05:07.608 --> 05:10.077
JONESY !

05:18.018 --> 05:19.953
YOU'VE KEPT
THINGS FROM ME.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.056
YOU WEREN'T READY.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.758
I NEEDED
TO PROTECT YOU.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.795
FROM WHAT ?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.700
YOU WERE ALWAYS
GIFTED, JUSTIN,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.969
BUT YOU NEEDED TIME
TO DEVELOP THOSE GIFTS.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.838
HOW DARE YOU.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.641
WHO WERE YOU TO DETERMINE
WHETHER I WAS READY OR NOT ?

05:40.741 --> 05:43.010
DO YOU KNOW HOW
I HAVE SUFFERED ?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.412
HOW I HAVE
STRUGGLED ?!

05:44.512 --> 05:46.113
HOW DARE YOU ?!

05:46.213 --> 05:48.315
STOP ACTING
LIKE A CHILD.

05:48.416 --> 05:52.520
I HAVE CARED FOR YOU
SINCE WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.189
AND I'VE LIVED
WITH THE BURDEN

05:56.289 --> 05:58.926
OF THIS KNOWLEDGE.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.062
YOU HAVE A DESTINY,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.765
AND NOW IS YOUR TIME
TO FULFILL IT.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.617
RED TIDE'S IN.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.546
( chatter )

08:12.760 --> 08:16.129
HARD TO SLEEP
IN HEAT LIKE THIS.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.884
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING ?

08:36.984 --> 08:40.721
THAT NIGHT WE FOUND
MY MAMA OUT THERE WITH YOU...

08:40.821 --> 08:45.225
HOW'D SHE REALLY
GET OUT HERE ?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.394
I TOLD YA,
SHE WALKED.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.597
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTED ?

08:49.697 --> 08:53.133
DID SHE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU ?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.903
DIDN'T MAKE
NO SENSE.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.171
TELL ME.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.843
"YOU'RE THE ONE."

09:02.943 --> 09:06.947
SHE SAID,
"YOU'RE THE ONE."

09:17.290 --> 09:19.026
SAMSON, SAMSON.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.995
YOUR PROBLEM IS,
YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED

09:22.095 --> 09:24.331
TO STAY OUT OF THINGS
THAT AREN'T YOUR CONCERN.

09:24.431 --> 09:28.602
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AT
THIS CARNIVAL IS MY BUSINESS.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.705
THAT INCLUDES
THE BOY.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.408
STICK TO TELLING THE ROUSTIES
WHERE TO PUT THEIR TENTS.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.746
THAT'S WHERE YOUR
TALENT LIES, LITTLE MAN.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.315
IT AIN'T OVER,
LODZ.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.589
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.492
TEMPORARY SET-BACK.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.163
HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU
A HAND WITH THIS.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.003
WHERE YOU HEADED ?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.639
THOUGHT I'D BUNK
OVER IN THE TENNER

10:05.739 --> 10:06.907
FOR A WHILE
WITH THE CREW.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.911
NAH, WHY DON'T YOU
SLEEP IN MY TENT ?

10:11.011 --> 10:13.080
I DON'T NEED
YOUR CHARITY.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.982
IT AIN'T CHARITY.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.284
NO MORE THAN WHAT
YOU'D DO FOR ME.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.987
YEAH ?

10:21.154 --> 10:24.257
WELL, WHERE YOU
DROPPING ANCHOR ?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.226
I'LL SLEEP
IN THE TRUCK.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.028
TRUCK'S ACES FOR ME.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.064
IT'S JUST A
TEMPORARY SITUATION.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.234
SURE, SUIT YOURSELF.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.047
( bicycle bell )

10:54.688 --> 10:56.757
( knocking )

11:02.195 --> 11:04.031

11:04.131 --> 11:05.498

11:05.598 --> 11:07.667

11:07.768 --> 11:09.469

WOW !

11:13.373 --> 11:14.808
YOU'RE BACK.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.343
HELLO, MR. DOLAN.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.811

VERY HAPPY.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.851

THIS IS A HAPPY DAY.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.987

11:27.087 --> 11:29.923
WELL, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW I WAS LEAVING.

11:30.023 --> 11:34.995
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO LOS ANGELES TO DO MY SHOW.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.065
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE
TO LEAVE SO SOON, MR. DOLAN.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.401
WELL, SURELY YOU COULD STAY
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE... ?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.737
WELL, WHY NOT ?

11:43.837 --> 11:47.074
PLEASE, COME IN.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.218
HEY, SWEETHEART.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.088
HEY.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.531
SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH YOUR MA AND JONES ?

12:11.631 --> 12:15.702
WHY ?

12:15.803 --> 12:20.040
LOOK AT 'EM,
TELL ME IT'S NOTHIN'.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.916
IT'S NOTHIN'.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.296
SOFIE, I'VE GOT
A PROBLEM.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.399
WHAT IS IT ?

12:46.499 --> 12:51.038
I KNOW YOUR MAMA'S HAD
A HARD RUN OF IT AND ALL, BUT...

12:51.138 --> 12:54.374
WELL, I BEEN CARRYIN'
YOU FOR DAYS.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.642
I KNOW.

12:55.742 --> 12:59.779
SHE'S LOSING IT,
SAMSON.

12:59.880 --> 13:04.918
I CAN'T DO THE SHOW
BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN STA

13:05.018 --> 13:07.054
TO BE IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH HER.

13:07.154 --> 13:11.124
I'M SORRY, BUT
MANAGEMENT DON'T LIKE IT.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.927
WHAT ?

13:14.027 --> 13:17.264
NO, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU AND MANAGEMENT--

13:17.364 --> 13:18.999
HE'S STILL THE BOSS.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.968
AND I'M STILL
RUNNING THE CARNIVAL.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.536
SO, I SUGGEST YOU AND
YOUR MAMA SQUARE THINGS AWAY,

13:23.636 --> 13:25.805
OR LOOK FOR
OTHER WORK !

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
IT'S JUST...

13:36.483 --> 13:40.888
NOT A GOOD TIME TO BE
A PROBLEM 'ROUND HERE, SOFIE.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.030
WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS KIND
OF RESPONSE TO A STORY.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.699
BAGS OF MAIL
EVERY DAY.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.534
HUNDREDS OF
PHONE CALLS.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.203
EVERYONE WANTS
TO KNOW, "WHERE,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.205
WHERE IS
BROTHER JUSTIN ?"

13:58.305 --> 14:00.140
AND HERE HE IS.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.442
HERE I AM.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.378
I'M TELLING YOU, JUSTIN,
WE GOTTA GET YOU ON THE RADIO.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.881

GONNA GO NUTS !

14:07.981 --> 14:09.849
GONNA WANT TO HEAR
THE WHOLE STORY,

14:09.950 --> 14:11.151
FROM BEGINNING
TO END.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.686
WHY SHOULD THAT
MATTER TO ME ?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.989
JUSTIN,

14:16.089 --> 14:19.026
MR. DOLAN HAS
HELPED ME SEE

14:19.126 --> 14:21.428
WE'RE MISSING
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.565
100,000 PEOPLE LISTEN
TO HIS SHOW EVERY WEEK.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.101
AND THOSE LISTENERS COULD BE
THE BACKBONE OF YOUR NEW CHURCH.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.638
GOD DOES NOT NEED A RADIO
TO SPREAD HIS WORD, IRIS.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.741
BUT IT SURE
COULDN'T HURT.

14:34.841 --> 14:38.511
30 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE RADIOS
IN THIS COUNTRY, BROTHER JUSTIN.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.647
IT'S A NEW AGE.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.250
PEOPLE ARE MOVED
BY YOUR STORY.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.919
THEY HAVE SENT
IN DONATIONS.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.155
WE MUST THINK OF
THE FUTURE, JUSTIN.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.291
ALL IN GOOD TIME, IRIS.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.935
MR. DOLAN, I WAS
WONDERING, PERHAPS,

15:02.035 --> 15:05.038
IF YOU WOULD CARE TO JOIN US
FOR CHURCH TOMORROW ?

15:05.138 --> 15:09.609
I'M SURE THAT YOU CAN
POSTPONE YOUR TRIP.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.848
WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
MUCH OF A CHURCH-GOER...

15:15.949 --> 15:18.518
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED A STORY.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.088
WELL, HEY.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.190
I'M NOT IN ANY
REAL RUSH.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.239
LET'S TRY AND
GET THERE IN ONE PIECE.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.079
* LISTEN TO
YOUR DADDY... *

16:55.115 --> 16:57.284
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
I NEED AN ARMED ESCORT.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.286
WE'RE LESS THAN A MILE
FROM THE BORDER.

16:59.386 --> 17:03.323
AIN'T SAFE FOR
A WOMAN ALONE.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.159
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GET AT
THE STORE SO BAD, ANYWAY ?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.995
TOOTHPASTE,
RAZOR BLADES.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.697
RAZOR BLADES ?

17:10.797 --> 17:13.700
YEAH, AFTER I BRUSH MY TEETH,
I'M GONNA SLIT MY WRISTS.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.069
THAT AIN'T FUNNY.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.205
JESUS, JONESY.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.674
I JUST GOTTA

17:32.452 --> 17:35.788

BESIDE THE DOOR.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.292
BENEVOLENT ORDER

17:39.392 --> 17:43.130
THIS IS THEIR DEN
OR LODGE OR WHATNOT.

WHERE YOU GOIN', BOY ?

17:46.399 --> 17:47.967

FELLA UP THERE,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.502

THE DEAL IS.

17:49.602 --> 17:55.041
LOOK, THIS IS A SECRET
FRATERNAL BROTHERHOOD.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.745
YOU LET ME

18:08.155 --> 18:10.457
EXCUSE ME.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.658

18:13.126 --> 18:16.463
SO, THIS IS THE BENEVOLENT
ORDER OF TEMPLAR, HUH ?

18:16.563 --> 18:17.897
YEP.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.333

18:21.834 --> 18:24.837
THIS MEAN
SOMETHING TO YOU ?

18:26.005 --> 18:27.440
NOPE.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.778
I THINK MY GRANDPA MAY

MISTER, MISTER.
HUH, TOUGH GUY ?

39:57.463 --> 40:00.165
CHINGA !

40:00.265 --> 40:02.233
QUE TIENE...

40:02.333 --> 40:06.538
BAJO QUE TU
TIENEN NO, NO !

40:10.842 --> 40:13.479
OH.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.095
( knocking )

40:33.098 --> 40:35.166
RUTHIE,
YOU AWAKE ?

40:35.266 --> 40:37.536
RUTHIE ?

40:37.636 --> 40:41.139
IT'S ONE OF
YOUR SNAKES.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.775
I WENT TO THE COOK TENT
TO MAKE MYSELF A CUP OF TEA.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.844
I OPENED THE STOVE
AND IT JUMPED OUT AT ME.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.079
YOU SURE IT'S
ONE OF MINE ?

40:48.179 --> 40:50.115
ANNABELLE'S CAGE
IS EMPTY.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.983
OH LORD.

40:52.083 --> 40:56.622
I'LL GET
MY SHOES ON.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.638
( music )

41:14.339 --> 41:17.543
YOU ARE A VERY
STUPID MAN, SENOR.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.747
WHERE AM I ?

41:21.847 --> 41:24.082
MY ROOM.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.886
I BROUGHT YOU HERE,
REMEMBER ?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.487
NO.

41:29.588 --> 41:32.891
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
ANY FRIENDS BACK THERE.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.894
THAT AIN'T ONE
OF MY STRENGTHS.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.999
I WOULD'VE
DANCED WITH YOU.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.500
OH, NOW YOU TELL ME.

41:42.601 --> 41:46.872
YOU'RE NOT FROM
AROUND HERE, ARE YA ?

41:46.972 --> 41:50.642
NO.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.651
DO YOU WANT A DRINK ?

41:59.751 --> 42:01.352
NO.

42:01.452 --> 42:06.291
I SHOULD BE GOING.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.803
BUT WE HAVEN'T
DANCED YET.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.511
MAYBE SOME
OTHER TIME.

42:26.612 --> 42:30.616
YOU ONLY GET
ONE CHANCE.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.568
( moaning )

43:57.736 --> 44:00.338
( panting )

44:28.166 --> 44:30.668
HE'S MINE.

44:34.740 --> 44:37.242
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN HERE ?

44:37.342 --> 44:39.277
GET OUT !

44:40.378 --> 44:44.549
GET OUT !

44:44.649 --> 44:49.888
YOU STAY OUT OF MY TRAILER,
YOU STINKIN' TWO-LEGGED RAT !

45:02.267 --> 45:04.135
LOOK, LIB.

45:04.235 --> 45:05.636
HERE'S ONE.

45:05.737 --> 45:07.472
IT'S ONLY A $1.49,

45:07.572 --> 45:10.809
AND SAYS IT'S A "SIMPLY DARLIN'
LADY LOU TWO-PIECE FROCK."

45:10.909 --> 45:13.244
AIN'T IT GAY ?

45:13.344 --> 45:16.982
( Samson )
HEY, STUMPY.

45:17.082 --> 45:18.316
WHAT ?

45:18.416 --> 45:21.719
SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YA.

45:23.922 --> 45:26.657
WHO THE HELL
IS THAT ?

45:26.758 --> 45:32.831
RITA SUE, THIS IS
CATALINA DE LE ROSA.

45:32.931 --> 45:36.301
SHE'S GONNA BE
THE NEW COOTCH DANCER.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.137
NICE TO MEET YA.

45:41.339 --> 45:45.043
( congregation singing )

46:06.865 --> 46:08.499
6YOU MAY BE SEATED.

46:10.735 --> 46:12.003
GOOD MORNING,
FRIENDS.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.372
AND WELCOME
TO OUR VISITORS.

46:14.472 --> 46:19.177
MANY OF US BEGIN THE VOYAGE
OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE

46:19.277 --> 46:23.248
UNDER BLUE SKIES
AND UPON CALM WATERS.

46:23.348 --> 46:27.085
BUT WHEN WE SAIL
OUT OF THE HARBOR--

46:27.185 --> 46:30.021
( door opening and closing )

46:30.121 --> 46:33.524
( congregations whispers )

46:34.826 --> 46:37.963
JUSTIN...

46:41.867 --> 46:44.202
MY SON.

46:54.179 --> 46:56.547
I HAVE JOURNEYED
INTO THE WILDERNESS,

46:56.647 --> 47:00.618
AND RETURNED WITH THE LOVE
OF THE LORD IN MY HEART...

47:00.718 --> 47:03.254
AND HIS HOLY MESSAGE

47:03.354 --> 47:06.557
ETCHED UPON MY SOUL.

47:08.393 --> 47:12.597
EVIL EXISTS,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.966
IT IS WRITTEN
IN THE BOOK OF MAN

47:15.066 --> 47:17.435
WITH BLOOD DRAWN
FROM LUCIFER'S VEINS.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.770
WE CANNOT ESCAPE IT.

47:19.871 --> 47:22.340
WE CANNOT
HIDE FROM IT.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.375
WE CANNOT DENY IT.

47:24.475 --> 47:26.577
IT IS PART OF
WHO WE ARE.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.413
WHO I AM.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.949
WHO YOU ARE.

47:31.049 --> 47:33.484
THE EVIL IN YOU

47:33.584 --> 47:37.122
IS THE ROOT
OF YOUR SIN.

47:38.323 --> 47:41.993
AND YOU HAVE
SINNED GREAT SINS.

47:49.034 --> 47:52.337
YOU HAVE LAID DOWN WITH
THE SISTER OF YOUR WIFE...

47:52.437 --> 47:58.243
STOLEN FROM THE CASHBOX
AT YOUR PLACE OF WORK...

47:58.343 --> 48:04.215
CHEATED LONG TIME
FRIENDS IN BUSINESS...

48:04.315 --> 48:08.453
LIED TO YOUR MOTHER
AND FATHER...

48:08.553 --> 48:14.926
YOU HAVE LUSTED FOR
THE LOINS OF A MAN...

48:21.866 --> 48:24.135
AND I...

48:27.672 --> 48:30.675
I HAVE
COMMITTED MURDER.

48:30.775 --> 48:33.979
( congregation gasps )

48:36.414 --> 48:39.750
IN MY HEART, I HAVE
KILLED MEN AGAIN AND AGAIN,

48:39.850 --> 48:41.652
WISHING FOR
THEIR DEATHS

48:41.752 --> 48:45.390
WITH LOATHSOME DESIRE
BORN OF MALICE AND SPITE.

48:45.490 --> 48:49.660
I AM AN EVIL MAN.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.830
I AM A SINFUL MAN.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.967
I AM A MAN.

48:56.067 --> 48:58.636
BUT WE CAN BE SAVED,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

48:58.736 --> 49:00.805
YES, WE CAN.

49:00.905 --> 49:02.573
NOT THROUGH PRAYER.

49:02.673 --> 49:03.808
NOT THROUGH
BIBLE STUDY.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.643
BUT THROUGH
BLOOD AND FIRE.

49:05.743 --> 49:08.546
THE BLOOD OF ATONEMENT,
AND THE FIRE OF RESURRECTION.

49:08.646 --> 49:11.716
FOR ONLY THROUGH DEATH
AND REBIRTH CAN SALVATION

49:11.816 --> 49:13.584
BE HAD BY MORTAL MAN.

49:13.684 --> 49:17.588
JUSTIN CROWE THE MAN
DIED IN THE WILDERNESS.

49:17.688 --> 49:20.191
HE DIED SO THAT
JUSTIN CROWE

49:20.291 --> 49:22.893
THE MESSENGER OF GOD
COULD BE REBORN THIS DAY.

49:22.994 --> 49:24.595
AND ONCE REBORN,

49:24.695 --> 49:27.165
WE WILL WIELD
THE MIGHTY SWORD

49:27.265 --> 49:29.234
OF OUR FATHER
IN HOLY BATTLE,

49:29.334 --> 49:32.603
AND WE WILL STRIKE DOWN
ALL THOSE WHO STAND AGAINST US

49:32.703 --> 49:34.705
INTO THE DEPTHS
OF HELL !

49:34.805 --> 49:36.574
AMEN !

49:36.674 --> 49:37.942
BAPTIZE ME.

49:38.043 --> 49:40.878
JUSTIN...

49:40.978 --> 49:43.648
I BAPTIZED YOU WHEN
YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD.

49:43.748 --> 49:45.850
BAPTIZE ME.

49:45.950 --> 49:48.753
I DON'T UNDERSTAND...

49:48.853 --> 49:51.622
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

49:58.229 --> 50:00.565
I BAPTIZE THEE
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

50:00.665 --> 50:02.333
AND OF THE SON--

50:10.708 --> 50:13.711
FINISH IT.

50:17.715 --> 50:21.086
AND OF
THE HOLY GHOST.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.692
( congregation whispers )

50:33.664 --> 50:35.433
BAPTIZE ME !

50:35.533 --> 50:40.338
BAPTIZE ME SO
I MAY BE REBORN

50:40.438 --> 50:44.775
AND JOIN MY BROTHER
IN HIS HOLY MISSION.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.518
BAPTIZE ME !

50:53.618 --> 50:58.055
BAPTIZE ME !

50:58.156 --> 51:01.126
BAPTIZE ME !

51:01.226 --> 51:03.027
( various voices )
BAPTIZE ME !

51:03.128 --> 51:05.730
BAPTIZE ME !

51:13.704 --> 51:16.040
YES, HE SPOKE
TO ME...

51:16.141 --> 51:17.742
DIRECTLY.

51:17.842 --> 51:20.077
HE KNOWS
WE HAVE THE BOY.

51:20.178 --> 51:22.847
( voice )
OF COURSE HE KNOWS.

51:22.947 --> 51:25.316
BUT WE'LL FIND HIM.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.686
AND THEN,
THE BLOOD WILL FLOW.
