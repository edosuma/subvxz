<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.398 --> 00:02.956
What is this?

00:03.067 --> 00:04.125
Let's just say now you've got

00:04.234 --> 00:06.327
all the sponsorship
you're gonna need.

00:06.437 --> 00:08.268
I'm gonna miss you, cowboy.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.674
You still haven't told them
about me, have you?

00:11.740 --> 00:12.974
No.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.074
I haven't.

00:14.178 --> 00:15.167
But I will.

00:15.279 --> 00:16.245
Promise?

00:16.379 --> 00:17.870
What's going on, Amy?

00:17.982 --> 00:19.381
What is that supposed to mean?

00:19.717 --> 00:21.241
Man, they are stubborn.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.380
Honey, it's just some tests.

00:23.487 --> 00:26.684
Whatever this is, Mom,
I'm not gonna let you do it alone.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.348
Are you breaking up with me?

00:28.459 --> 00:29.983
Kit!

00:31.495 --> 00:32.723
I can't pretend anymore.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.855
This friends thing
is not working out for me.

01:06.563 --> 01:08.827
Well, there was a real bad snowfall
just west of here.

01:08.932 --> 01:11.526
So I hear. Guess they're closing
some roads down early.

01:11.635 --> 01:13.500
Just about froze to death
in my loft last night.

01:13.604 --> 01:16.505
Global warming, they say.
World's coming to an end.

01:16.607 --> 01:17.164
Right.

01:17.274 --> 01:18.263
You want coffee?

01:18.375 --> 01:19.865
Yeah.

01:19.977 --> 01:22.741
So, if it's getting too cold
in that loft of yours...

01:22.846 --> 01:24.780
Sleep on the couch
in front of the fireplace?

01:24.882 --> 01:26.042
No.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.311
You might want to try
a few extra blankets.

01:28.419 --> 01:29.408
Oh, thanks.

01:29.586 --> 01:33.750
I don't want you and your dirty socks
lying all around my living room.

01:34.658 --> 01:35.249
Hey.

01:35.359 --> 01:35.950
Hey.

01:36.126 --> 01:37.286
Scott's gotten some calls

01:37.394 --> 01:39.089
about some wild horses
up in the foothills.

01:39.196 --> 01:41.494
Just about starved.
There's a herd up near Fish Creek.

01:41.598 --> 01:42.895
Up near the fishing cabin?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.890
Yeah. There's some colts, too.

01:45.002 --> 01:47.402
- Colts?
- Oh, don't tell her that.

01:47.504 --> 01:49.904
Snow's gotten so deep, they can't
get to the grass underneath.

01:53.077 --> 01:55.102
If you start feeding them,
they just get all dependent.

01:55.212 --> 01:57.476
It's hard to be dependent
when you starve to death first.

01:57.581 --> 01:59.208
Listen.

01:59.316 --> 02:01.614
It's just not good for them
in the long run.

02:01.718 --> 02:03.982
Dying's not good for them either
in the long run.

02:04.088 --> 02:05.316
See what you started?

02:05.422 --> 02:06.684
I'm sorry. I was just saying.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.257
Well, quit saying and start working

02:08.358 --> 02:11.020
before we're up to our eyeballs
in snow here, too.

02:15.032 --> 02:16.294
Dad.

02:16.967 --> 02:19.197
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:19.937 --> 02:21.336
I just came from the bakery,

02:21.438 --> 02:23.167
and I got the most amazing
butter tarts.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.002
- Want one?
- No, thanks, hon.

02:25.109 --> 02:26.041
Okay. What's the matter?

02:26.143 --> 02:27.667
I spent the last hour in the bank

02:27.778 --> 02:30.008
explaining away
my cash-flow problems.

02:30.114 --> 02:32.480
Not to mention
the huge tax bill I got to pay.

02:32.883 --> 02:34.282
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:34.384 --> 02:36.944
Well, it'll get better.

02:37.054 --> 02:38.885
I may not have
a cattle business anymore,

02:38.954 --> 02:40.585
but at least we still have
the dude ranch.

02:40.724 --> 02:42.248
Yes. And it's doing well.

02:42.359 --> 02:44.827
So, if you need anything,
you just say the word, okay?

02:44.928 --> 02:46.896
- Thanks, honey.
- Okay.

02:48.398 --> 02:51.162
There's that oil guy,
that P.W. Morris.

02:51.268 --> 02:53.566
P.W. What kind of idiot
goes by his initials?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.661
I'm surprised that guy
shows his face in this town.

02:55.772 --> 02:58.002
Yeah. You know what?
I got to run, Dad, okay?

02:58.108 --> 02:59.507
- I'll see you.
- Okay, honey.

03:08.919 --> 03:12.514
Hey, boy.
How you doing?

03:13.590 --> 03:14.716
Hey.

03:15.325 --> 03:18.419
Grandpa? That whole attitude
drives me crazy.

03:18.529 --> 03:21.396
- I think we should do something.
- Yeah, but...

03:21.532 --> 03:24.134
I have a plan.

03:24.134 --> 03:25.761
Of course you do.

03:27.738 --> 03:29.899
I was thinking maybe a road trip.

03:30.774 --> 03:32.071
- Road trip?
- Yeah.

03:32.176 --> 03:33.438
Just you and me.

03:33.977 --> 03:34.909
I'm listening.

03:35.012 --> 03:36.980
Maybe we could take your truck
with a big load of hay

03:37.080 --> 03:39.605
up to Fish Creek,
you know, on Saturday.

03:39.716 --> 03:41.741
Up to Grandpa's fishing cabin.

03:41.852 --> 03:45.288
And feed the wild horses.

03:47.925 --> 03:48.983
Sounds okay to me.

03:49.092 --> 03:51.754
But I don't think Jack's gonna think
it's such a good idea.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.092
Maybe Grandpa
doesn't need to know.

04:49.753 --> 04:51.015
So...

04:51.121 --> 04:53.055
You're a man of many secrets.

04:53.156 --> 04:54.555
What?

04:54.658 --> 04:55.682
Kit.

04:55.859 --> 04:57.156
Kit?

04:57.261 --> 04:59.661
Yeah. You broke up with Kit.

04:59.763 --> 05:00.388
I can't believe

05:00.497 --> 05:01.521
you actually took my advice.

05:01.632 --> 05:03.429
It's not like
you didn't see it coming.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.023
What made you do it?

05:05.135 --> 05:06.830
Hand me that bucket.

05:06.937 --> 05:08.962
Oh, my gosh, Ty.
You know I know.

05:09.072 --> 05:10.835
So, why can't you
just give me the details?

05:11.008 --> 05:13.340
You know, Mallory, there's such
a thing as knowing too much.

05:13.477 --> 05:15.138
No, there isn't.

05:15.245 --> 05:17.213
Don't you have your own love life
to worry about?

05:17.314 --> 05:18.281
Excuse me?

05:18.382 --> 05:20.543
Isn't Jake coming over
for the weekend?

05:20.651 --> 05:22.846
Okay. That has nothing to do
with a love life.

05:22.953 --> 05:24.318
His parents are going to a funeral,

05:24.421 --> 05:26.548
and he's not allowed
to stay home alone.

05:26.657 --> 05:27.885
So, have you told anybody

05:27.991 --> 05:29.549
about your other little thing?

05:29.660 --> 05:31.127
You never stop, do you?

05:31.228 --> 05:32.695
No, I haven't, okay?

05:32.796 --> 05:35.356
It's not public knowledge,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.160
Guess what?
I have an announcement.

05:37.267 --> 05:38.427
Mallory, don't.

05:38.535 --> 05:42.164
Ty here got his online
high school diploma.

05:42.306 --> 05:43.967
He was, like,
in the top 10 percentile.

05:44.074 --> 05:45.405
Good for you, man.

05:45.509 --> 05:47.534
Ty, that is great.
Why didn't you tell us?

05:47.678 --> 05:50.442
Because nobody around here
can tell anybody anything

05:50.547 --> 05:52.344
because everything
is a big mystery.

05:52.449 --> 05:53.416
Yeah, no, Mallory.

05:53.517 --> 05:55.747
Actually you just create mysteries
where there are none.

05:55.852 --> 05:56.477
Yeah, right.

05:56.586 --> 05:57.348
[Phone rings]

05:57.454 --> 05:58.216
I'll get it.

05:58.322 --> 06:00.119
- Good on you.
- Thanks.

06:00.223 --> 06:03.192
Hey, Ty, that's great.

06:03.927 --> 06:05.758
That's awesome. Really.

06:05.862 --> 06:07.386
Thanks.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.660
Mallory's right, though.
Why so secretive?

06:10.767 --> 06:12.826
No reason. I just...

06:12.936 --> 06:15.063
I was gonna tell you,
but guess who beat me to it.

06:15.172 --> 06:16.036
LOU:
Tomorrow?

06:16.139 --> 06:18.164
I'm already gonna be in town,
so, I'll just meet you there.

06:18.909 --> 06:22.367
What? Green Mountain Spa
this weekend?

06:22.479 --> 06:24.879
But that place is booked up,
like, months in advance.

06:24.981 --> 06:25.879
Internet guy.

06:25.982 --> 06:27.711
I think we should stage
an intervention.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.514
Speaking of interventions.

06:32.622 --> 06:33.520
What?

06:33.623 --> 06:35.955
Don't you get it?
He's at a total crossroads.

06:36.059 --> 06:37.526
What are you talking about?

06:37.627 --> 06:39.754
Come on, Amy.
He just got his high school diploma.

06:39.863 --> 06:40.989
He just broke up with Kit.

06:42.132 --> 06:43.690
You did know that, right?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.893
The whole school knows that.

06:46.002 --> 06:48.266
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- I'm working on it.

06:48.372 --> 06:49.134
How?

06:50.173 --> 06:51.470
It's none of your business.

06:51.575 --> 06:54.476
Well, don't screw it up this time.

07:00.951 --> 07:02.885
Come on, Harley.

07:02.986 --> 07:07.787
So, I thought I'd pack us a lunch
so we wouldn't starve tomorrow.

07:08.759 --> 07:09.817
Cool.

07:09.926 --> 07:11.086
Yeah, we can just tell Grandpa

07:11.194 --> 07:12.957
that we're taking the hay
to the dude ranch

07:13.063 --> 07:15.031
and going to see a movie in town
or something.

07:16.099 --> 07:19.193
Okay, here's the deal.
I just talked to Scott.

07:19.302 --> 07:21.202
He said taking hay up there

07:21.304 --> 07:23.932
is the only way
those horses will survive.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.473
So...

07:25.575 --> 07:27.475
What are you saying?
We can go?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.374
Yes.

07:29.479 --> 07:31.504
- That's great.
- I'll pack the truck tonight.

07:31.615 --> 07:33.674
Sounds good. We'll leave
first thing in the morning.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.251
We?

07:35.352 --> 07:38.947
You think I want you two driving
on those icy roads alone?

07:45.962 --> 07:47.953
It wasn't exactly
the weekend I was planning.

07:48.064 --> 07:50.464
Well, has he said anything
about the whole Kit thing?

07:50.567 --> 07:52.535
No. And how weird is that?

07:52.636 --> 07:54.627
He didn't even tell me
he got his high school diploma.

07:54.738 --> 07:55.864
I had to find out from Mallory.

07:55.972 --> 07:57.166
Boys suck.

07:58.241 --> 08:00.835
That's why I kind of wanted
this trip to happen.

08:00.944 --> 08:03.572
There's just so many things
that we need to talk about.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.544
Just talk?

08:04.681 --> 08:05.875
Shut up.

08:06.716 --> 08:08.308
Hey, girls.

08:09.052 --> 08:10.644
Hey, have you talked to Caleb?

08:11.354 --> 08:12.821
Yeah.

08:12.989 --> 08:14.286
Yeah? How is he?

08:14.391 --> 08:15.983
Great.

08:16.092 --> 08:17.719
He hasn't called you?

08:18.895 --> 08:19.919
No, actually.

08:20.063 --> 08:21.826
Oh, my God. You're so lucky.

08:21.932 --> 08:23.126
He's always texting me.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.793
And then when I talk to him,
I can't get him off the phone.

08:25.902 --> 08:29.201
Anyway, what's this I hear
about Ty and Kit?

08:29.306 --> 08:30.432
Drama, drama, drama.

08:34.744 --> 08:35.938
Bye, Grandpa.

08:36.046 --> 08:37.376
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:37.481 --> 08:39.414
We need to talk, you and me.

08:39.515 --> 08:43.111
Now, I'm going up
to the cabin tomorrow

08:43.220 --> 08:44.983
with Amy and Ty for the day.

08:45.155 --> 08:48.420
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mallory and Jake.

08:48.592 --> 08:49.581
We're fine on our own.

08:49.693 --> 08:51.251
Grandpa, I can't.
I have plans.

08:51.361 --> 08:52.259
What plans?

08:52.362 --> 08:55.160
I'm going away for the weekend.
I'm sure I told you.

08:55.265 --> 08:56.527
We don't need a baby-sitter.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.727
What is with you lately?
You're always off gadding about.

08:59.836 --> 09:01.804
Is this still the Internet boyfriend?

09:01.905 --> 09:03.668
Does he have a face?
Does he have a name?

09:03.773 --> 09:05.900
- Yes, he does.
- Probably an alias.

09:06.009 --> 09:07.499
Do I get to meet him?

09:07.611 --> 09:09.010
Yeah, Lou.
When do we get to meet him?

09:09.112 --> 09:10.579
You will.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.012
I just don't like you seeing
a total stranger.

09:13.116 --> 09:15.050
He's not, okay? He's...

09:16.453 --> 09:18.717
He's a good person,
and he's a real gentleman.

09:18.822 --> 09:19.914
And I like him a lot.

09:20.023 --> 09:21.786
As long as he treats you right.

09:21.958 --> 09:22.754
He does.

09:22.859 --> 09:24.759
Yeah, and he isn't an ax murderer.

09:24.861 --> 09:28.524
Or worse, an oilman.

09:36.973 --> 09:39.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:39.442 --> 09:41.706
Let's hit the road.
I am starving.

09:41.811 --> 09:44.609
We should discuss tomorrow.
Going away.

09:44.714 --> 09:45.976
I'm already gonna be in town.

09:46.082 --> 09:47.879
So, I'll just transfer my luggage
into your car.

09:47.984 --> 09:49.110
- We can go from there.
- No.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.481
No? What do you mean, no?

09:50.587 --> 09:53.613
No, I mean, I'll be picking you up
at your house tomorrow at noon.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.384
No, no, no. That's way too much
trouble for you.

09:55.492 --> 09:56.390
I'll meet you here.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.222
No, it's no trouble at all.
And that's what's gonna happen.

09:59.329 --> 10:01.729
Me at your house. Tomorrow.

10:01.898 --> 10:02.990
At noon. Picking you up.

10:03.099 --> 10:05.761
- Okay.
- Good.

10:05.869 --> 10:07.427
One more thing
I wanted to ask you about.

10:07.537 --> 10:08.094
What?

10:08.204 --> 10:10.104
What was that yesterday morning?

10:10.206 --> 10:12.003
Yesterday what?

10:12.108 --> 10:14.406
In town. I saw you see me.

10:14.511 --> 10:15.842
Peter, I didn't see you.

10:15.946 --> 10:17.538
I think you did, Lou.
I think you did.

10:17.647 --> 10:18.579
And then you took off.

10:18.682 --> 10:21.082
I have a distinct feeling it was
because you were with your father.

10:21.184 --> 10:22.173
No, no.

10:22.385 --> 10:25.252
Yeah. Have you told them
about me yet?

10:25.355 --> 10:26.413
I...

10:26.523 --> 10:28.718
You haven't.

10:28.825 --> 10:30.656
You know, it's not...

10:30.760 --> 10:32.523
You just promised
you were gonna do that, Lou.

10:32.629 --> 10:34.290
Peter, look, I will.

10:34.397 --> 10:36.388
I tried. I did. I tried.

10:36.415 --> 00:15.278
Me, I haven't.

10:36.499 --> 10:38.990
It just...
It wasn't the right time.

10:39.102 --> 10:41.195
But when it is the right time, I...

10:43.073 --> 10:44.040
Shoot!

10:52.716 --> 10:56.812
Well, change of plans.

10:56.920 --> 11:01.016
It seems I have to baby-sit
Mallory and Jake

11:01.124 --> 11:03.991
because Lou is off
God knows where.

11:04.094 --> 11:05.721
So, I can't go tomorrow.

11:06.763 --> 11:09.698
So, I guess we can't go either?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.359
Well, here's the thing.

11:12.469 --> 11:17.634
Is this about helping the horses
or is this about Ty?

11:17.741 --> 11:21.404
This is about helping the horses,
what else?

11:22.412 --> 11:23.811
I know about Kit.

11:23.913 --> 11:26.006
And I'd have to be blind

11:26.116 --> 11:28.209
not to see what's been going on
between you two.

11:28.318 --> 11:29.876
You've been circling each other
for months.

11:29.986 --> 11:30.680
Grandpa.

11:30.787 --> 11:33.756
The roads are gonna be
in poor condition.

11:33.857 --> 11:35.757
There's early closures
all over the place.

11:35.859 --> 11:37.349
And the weather's unpredictable.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.394
- Okay, fine, we won't go.
- No.

11:39.496 --> 11:44.524
I'm saying you and Ty
should take the big truck.

11:44.634 --> 11:47.762
'Cause it's safer than
that piece of garbage he drives.

11:47.871 --> 11:50.305
And you'll get a bigger load
of hay on, too.

11:51.441 --> 11:53.773
Thank you.

11:57.313 --> 11:59.747
You won't have any cell phone
reception up there,

11:59.849 --> 12:02.249
so here's a battery
for that old radio up in the cabin.

12:02.352 --> 12:03.842
You still remember
how to use that, right?

12:03.953 --> 12:04.851
I do, Grandpa.

12:04.954 --> 12:06.922
I'll dust the one off here
so we can communicate.

12:07.023 --> 12:07.580
Okay.

12:07.691 --> 12:09.386
Ty, take Highway 40 north.

12:09.492 --> 12:11.858
No shortcuts, and stay off
those mountain side roads.

12:11.961 --> 12:13.087
Okay, okay.

12:13.196 --> 12:14.857
- Watch out for black ice.
- Grandpa.

12:14.964 --> 12:16.727
- Deer.
- Okay, Grandpa.

12:16.833 --> 12:17.959
Bye.

12:18.068 --> 12:19.660
See you, Jack.

12:29.679 --> 12:30.773
Got you! Oh, yeah!

12:30.780 --> 12:33.112
No way! You totally blocked me!
You're such a cheat!

12:33.416 --> 12:34.474
Yeah, right!

12:34.584 --> 12:36.245
I beat you every other time.

12:36.352 --> 12:38.684
- Well, that's 'cause I let you.
- "B" capital "S"!

12:40.156 --> 12:40.986
[Glass breaks]

12:41.090 --> 12:42.079
Look what you did!

12:42.258 --> 12:43.247
I'm sorry.

12:43.359 --> 12:45.759
Hey, you guys better not
have spilled Coke on the couch.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.659
We didn't.
It wasn't anyone's fault.

12:47.764 --> 12:48.788
I'll clean it up.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.890
Do you have, like,
a dust pan or something?

12:53.536 --> 12:55.663
So, when are you heading out
for your weekend?

12:55.772 --> 12:56.670
Soon.

12:56.773 --> 13:00.402
And, listen, Grandpa,
he's coming to pick me up.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.205
- What are you doing?
- I want you to promise that...

13:02.312 --> 13:04.678
Don't pick up the glass
with your fingers, idiot!

13:04.781 --> 13:05.975
Grandpa.

13:06.082 --> 13:08.812
Before you two
trash this place completely,

13:08.918 --> 13:11.512
could I interest you
in lunch at Maggie's?

13:11.621 --> 13:12.781
- Sure.
- Awesome.

13:12.889 --> 13:14.754
All right, then, let's go. Now.

13:16.726 --> 13:17.818
Thanks, Jack.

13:17.961 --> 13:20.555
Don't mention it.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.656
Hey.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.395
I appreciate you coming out
and meeting with me.

13:27.503 --> 13:28.834
It's no problem.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.769
But I'm guessing
you didn't invite me out here

13:30.874 --> 13:31.898
to discuss the weather.

13:32.008 --> 13:34.306
Well, I remember you offered
to buy a piece of Jack's land

13:34.410 --> 13:36.469
when his barn burned down.

13:36.579 --> 13:38.979
But he preferred to depend
on the kindness of strangers.

13:40.350 --> 13:41.783
Are you still interested
in a few acres?

13:42.385 --> 13:44.785
I might be. Who's selling?

13:45.989 --> 13:48.890
Well, I got myself
in a kind of a situation.

13:48.992 --> 13:50.619
Well, I've always admired

13:50.727 --> 13:53.594
that piece of land
between the river and Heartland.

13:53.696 --> 13:55.254
It's got nice views.
Good road access.

13:55.365 --> 13:57.299
It would be easy to service.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.198
So, you're thinking of developing.

14:00.303 --> 14:02.464
Doesn't matter
what I'm thinking, Tim.

14:02.572 --> 14:04.301
I mean, come on.

14:04.407 --> 14:06.068
You might have bought
Ray Phillips' ranch,

14:06.175 --> 14:08.803
but you didn't buy
into his poverty philosophy, did you?

14:09.646 --> 14:11.807
Living like a pauper
on millions of dollars worth of land?

14:11.981 --> 14:13.608
Tossing and turning at night,

14:13.716 --> 14:15.206
worrying about
making your mortgage,

14:15.318 --> 14:17.752
and here's a friendly neighbor
with a checkbook

14:17.854 --> 14:21.153
offering to solve all your problems.

14:21.891 --> 14:23.882
It's not that hard a decision, Tim.

14:52.789 --> 14:54.086
No horses.

14:55.525 --> 14:57.493
They'll come.

14:59.595 --> 15:01.222
It's pretty cool out here.

15:01.331 --> 15:03.799
It's freezing!

15:17.313 --> 15:18.302
Hey.

15:19.482 --> 15:20.881
May I come in?

15:20.984 --> 15:22.918
Sure.

15:23.619 --> 15:25.018
Oh.

15:25.121 --> 15:26.588
Good lord, Ashley.

15:26.689 --> 15:28.179
Mother, don't start.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.383
It's cold in here.

15:29.492 --> 15:31.687
Well, me and this
30-year-old heater here

15:31.794 --> 15:33.159
have a love-hate relationship.

15:33.262 --> 15:35.423
But, hey.

15:35.531 --> 15:36.930
How are you?

15:37.033 --> 15:40.059
Well, actually, I have some news.

15:40.837 --> 15:42.361
The tests results came back.

15:43.239 --> 15:45.332
And it's good.

15:45.441 --> 15:47.841
It's all good.

15:52.448 --> 15:53.540
So, let's go celebrate.

15:53.649 --> 15:55.344
I'll take you to the club
for lunch, all right?

15:55.451 --> 15:56.042
Okay.

15:56.152 --> 15:58.211
- I should change.
- Yeah, you should.

15:59.455 --> 16:01.252
I'm kidding.

16:04.527 --> 16:07.189
So, Kit.

16:07.296 --> 16:09.856
Were you ever gonna tell me?

16:09.966 --> 16:11.729
There's nothing to tell.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.234
Just didn't work out, that's all.

16:14.337 --> 16:16.305
Did you heard from Caleb?

16:17.106 --> 16:20.507
Nope. Ashley has.

16:20.610 --> 16:23.477
Apparently he calls her
all the time.

16:25.281 --> 16:27.078
Not that I was really expecting
to hear from him.

16:27.183 --> 16:30.550
It would just be nice to know
how he's doing, you know?

16:31.220 --> 16:32.949
You're really working up a sweat.

16:33.056 --> 16:35.217
I could use a little more muscle
out of you.

16:35.324 --> 16:36.689
I'm keeping up.

16:36.793 --> 16:37.452
Are you?

16:37.627 --> 16:38.855
Yes!

16:38.961 --> 16:40.758
How about now?

16:40.863 --> 16:42.330
[Knocking on door]

16:43.199 --> 16:44.029
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.465
Sweetie, you're late.
We should get going.

16:46.569 --> 16:48.730
- Where is everybody?
- Out.

16:48.838 --> 16:50.271
Hey, I had them all here waiting.

16:50.373 --> 16:52.739
You were late.
So, don't blame me.

16:52.842 --> 16:55.367
That's convenient.

16:58.414 --> 17:00.882
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

17:00.983 --> 17:02.814
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:02.919 --> 17:06.082
So, you're gonna be okay
in that thing?

17:06.189 --> 17:07.713
It really is cold in there.

17:08.991 --> 17:10.720
I don't mind the cold.

17:10.827 --> 17:13.954
It just gets Ionely without Caleb.

17:15.330 --> 17:17.060
I miss him.

17:17.165 --> 17:18.133
Who knew?

17:19.035 --> 17:22.492
But typical guy. Doesn't call.

17:22.605 --> 17:23.867
I was sure he was gonna call

17:23.973 --> 17:26.167
to tell me how many stupid
belt buckles he was winning.

17:26.275 --> 17:28.402
But nothing.

17:28.511 --> 17:31.309
Well, what can I say?

17:31.414 --> 17:33.939
He's a cowboy.

17:34.684 --> 17:37.414
Look, Ashley, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.545
Move back home. Please.

17:39.655 --> 17:41.885
I mean, come on. We can join
two or three rooms together.

17:41.991 --> 17:43.390
You can have
your own little apartment.

17:43.493 --> 17:45.085
It'll be just like living on your own.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.320
Only it'll have heat.

17:48.498 --> 17:50.830
Just think about it, okay?

17:50.933 --> 17:51.922
Okay.

17:52.101 --> 17:53.500
Good.

17:53.603 --> 17:56.629
Well, thanks for lunch.

17:56.739 --> 17:59.003
I'm really happy about the news.

17:59.742 --> 18:01.733
Thank you.

18:04.347 --> 18:07.009
Well, here's to getting your diploma.

18:07.116 --> 18:09.084
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.883
You've hardly touched your food.
Are you okay?

18:14.991 --> 18:17.221
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.324
Can I ask you something?

18:20.429 --> 18:21.919
Yeah.

18:22.031 --> 18:24.124
You know when you
picked me up at Victor's

18:24.233 --> 18:29.193
and you said that our friendship
wasn't working for you,

18:29.305 --> 18:32.331
that you couldn't pretend?

18:32.441 --> 18:35.137
I can't...

18:35.478 --> 18:37.878
I can't just be your friend.

18:39.215 --> 18:43.618
I guess I want to know
where I stand.

18:44.387 --> 18:46.787
Not just with you,
but with everything.

18:48.191 --> 18:51.524
I have to start making some choices,
what I'm doing with my life.

18:51.627 --> 18:54.858
Yeah. Mallory said
you were at a crossroads.

18:54.964 --> 18:55.931
Yeah, well...

18:56.032 --> 18:58.296
That diploma.

18:58.401 --> 19:01.234
Do you know
what that means to me?

19:01.404 --> 19:03.895
I mean, you're gonna take it
for granted when you get yours.

19:04.006 --> 19:06.839
Me, it's the first time in my life
where I have choices.

19:06.943 --> 19:08.410
And I know that sounds lame, but...

19:08.511 --> 19:09.443
No.

19:09.545 --> 19:11.979
No, it doesn't.

19:13.149 --> 19:15.481
So, what do you want to do?

19:17.420 --> 19:19.217
I've actually been talking to Scott.

19:19.322 --> 19:20.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:20.656 --> 19:23.853
He said I could hang out with him
or, you know, intern.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.949
Apprentice.

19:25.061 --> 19:26.323
Well, that's pretty awesome.

19:26.429 --> 19:28.226
Yeah, yeah. No, it's great.

19:28.331 --> 19:32.131
But we'll see, you know?
We'll see how it all turns out.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.228
Well...

19:38.307 --> 19:40.502
What do you want to do with us?

19:43.646 --> 19:46.012
I guess that's up to you.

19:49.585 --> 19:51.678
[Horses neigh in the distance]

19:52.788 --> 19:54.050
Did you hear that?

19:54.156 --> 19:56.351
[Horses neigh in the distance]

20:29.959 --> 20:31.950
Why are we stopping here?

20:32.061 --> 20:33.824
I'm just gonna grab a coffee.
You want some?

20:34.764 --> 20:37.289
No. You know, there's
way better coffee on the way.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.197
Why don't we just grab something
on the road?

20:39.302 --> 20:41.429
I'm here right now.
It'll take me two seconds.

20:46.142 --> 20:47.609
Val.

20:48.177 --> 20:49.075
Jack.

20:49.178 --> 20:50.839
How are things? Any news?

20:50.946 --> 20:52.538
News?

20:52.648 --> 20:53.410
Oh!

20:53.516 --> 20:56.212
Well, I mean,
I'd like to help Tim out,

20:56.319 --> 20:57.843
but he has to decide.

20:57.953 --> 20:59.181
He said he'd get back to me.

20:59.288 --> 21:00.687
About what?

21:01.390 --> 21:02.084
His land.

21:02.258 --> 21:04.192
So, what about his land?

21:10.232 --> 21:11.358
Fill that up for me?

21:11.467 --> 21:12.729
- Just coffee?
- Yep.

21:13.969 --> 21:15.937
That's the oil guy
that Lou totally destroyed.

21:16.038 --> 21:17.437
Such a jerk.

21:17.540 --> 21:22.773
Jack, am I getting into the middle
of some nasty family feud here?

21:22.878 --> 21:25.142
Tim isn't exactly family.

21:25.247 --> 21:26.646
Right.

21:26.749 --> 21:29.843
Okay, then. Well, look at it
on the bright side.

21:29.952 --> 21:31.078
Once the deal goes through,

21:31.187 --> 21:32.916
you'll have a nice buffer
between the two of you.

21:35.491 --> 21:37.254
Good to see you.

21:40.296 --> 21:43.265
Mallory. Jake. Let's go.

21:47.370 --> 21:51.306
Oh, hey, I just lost an earring here.

21:51.407 --> 21:53.432
Oh, found it.

21:53.542 --> 21:54.440
Yep.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.786
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

22:04.887 --> 22:06.878
The oil guy is the Internet guy!

22:06.989 --> 22:08.115
What?

22:08.224 --> 22:11.159
Lou's Internet boyfriend
is P.W. Morris!

22:11.260 --> 22:12.318
Who?

22:12.428 --> 22:14.828
Jack is gonna go nuts.
Everyone's gonna go nuts.

22:14.930 --> 22:16.192
Come on, you two.
Pick up the pace!

22:16.298 --> 22:17.230
I got things to do.

22:23.806 --> 22:25.103
They're amazing.

22:35.351 --> 22:37.751
You okay?

22:38.754 --> 22:40.312
I don't feel so good.

22:50.966 --> 22:52.695
There's Ghost.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.269
Ghost?

22:54.370 --> 22:55.837
Where?

22:58.407 --> 22:59.635
Right there.

23:03.045 --> 23:05.343
I don't see him.
He's not there.

23:15.758 --> 23:17.055
Ty!

23:18.127 --> 23:19.617
Ty!

23:23.799 --> 23:25.391
Oh, God, Ty.
You're burning up.

23:25.501 --> 23:27.401
I'm okay.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.740
No, just lie still. Please.

23:32.842 --> 23:34.241
Amy.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.828
Don't know why I bother.
I don't have any cattle.

24:00.936 --> 24:02.426
Doesn't much matter
if my gate works.

24:02.538 --> 24:04.165
Yeah, well, that gate
might come in handy

24:04.273 --> 24:07.071
if you want to keep angry
ex-father-in-laws off your property.

24:07.176 --> 24:08.268
What did I do now, Jack?

24:08.377 --> 24:09.810
You know damn well
what you've done.

24:09.912 --> 24:11.243
You've offered to sell Val Stanton

24:11.347 --> 24:13.247
everything on the west side
of your property,

24:13.349 --> 24:14.748
which just happens to be

24:14.850 --> 24:16.681
the part that butts up
against my mine.

24:16.785 --> 24:19.117
I don't have any options.
Look, I'm on my last legs.

24:19.221 --> 24:21.018
I either do this,
or I sell the whole package.

24:21.123 --> 24:23.717
Then, sell her something
on the other side!

24:29.832 --> 24:32.062
RADIO: <i>All secondary roads</i>
<i>south of Highway 40</i>

24:32.167 --> 24:35.534
<i>have been closed due to the snow</i>
<i>and risk of avalanche.</i>

24:35.638 --> 24:38.368
Peter, what are you doing?
Why are we turning around?

24:38.474 --> 24:40.135
It's just as well.
Might as well go home.

24:40.242 --> 24:42.904
What? Why would we do that?

24:43.012 --> 24:45.640
We don't have to go
to Green Mountain Spa.

24:45.748 --> 24:48.239
We can go somewhere else.

24:48.350 --> 24:49.783
Why are you doing this?

24:49.885 --> 24:51.318
I think you know why.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.354
No, I don't.

24:53.455 --> 24:57.619
Because this whole thing, us...

24:57.726 --> 25:00.092
I don't think
it's really going anywhere.

25:00.195 --> 25:01.628
What are you talking about?

25:01.730 --> 25:03.823
Let's be honest.

25:03.933 --> 25:05.332
What am I to you?

25:05.434 --> 25:07.265
I'm an oilman, right?
A parasite.

25:07.369 --> 25:08.996
- Peter.
- No, it's true.

25:09.104 --> 25:12.130
I mean, you can't even bring yourself
to tell your family we're going out.

25:12.241 --> 25:13.435
- That is not true!
- It is true.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.066
I embarrass you or something.

25:15.177 --> 25:17.873
We've been skulking around,
hiding out for weeks now.

25:17.980 --> 25:21.006
And, honestly, I'm done.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.141
Peter!

25:23.650 --> 25:25.241
Wait. Okay.

25:25.454 --> 25:27.479
You're right, okay?
You're right.

25:27.590 --> 25:28.488
Let's go back.

25:28.624 --> 25:30.990
And we'll tell my grandpa,
and we'll tell everybody

25:31.093 --> 25:32.822
because you don't
embarrass me, okay?

25:32.928 --> 25:34.156
Ever.

25:34.296 --> 25:35.695
Ever.

25:35.896 --> 25:38.695
I manage to do that just fine
on my own.

25:41.570 --> 25:43.231
I wouldn't tell Jack if I were you.

25:43.339 --> 25:44.670
Yes, but it's in my head.

25:44.773 --> 25:47.970
And once things are in my head,
they come out of my mouth.

25:48.077 --> 25:51.103
Maybe Ty's right.
Maybe you can know too much.

25:53.882 --> 25:55.315
Oh, boy.

25:59.588 --> 26:03.786
Okay. Things are about to get ugly.

26:05.094 --> 26:06.789
Hey.

26:06.895 --> 26:08.453
Is Grandpa here?

26:10.633 --> 26:11.998
Grandpa?

26:12.134 --> 26:13.123
Lou.

26:13.235 --> 26:14.964
Thought you were on your way...

26:15.104 --> 26:17.231
Hey, Jack Bartlett.
Nice to see you again.

26:18.707 --> 26:22.040
Grandpa,
you remember Peter Morris.

26:22.911 --> 26:25.903
Internet guy.

26:39.895 --> 26:41.726
We need to get out of here.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.092
I can drive.

26:43.198 --> 26:44.529
No, you can't.

26:45.834 --> 26:46.664
Oh.

26:56.345 --> 26:58.370
No signal. Figures.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.447
Where are the keys?

26:59.548 --> 27:01.448
No, you're not driving.
Forget it.

27:16.298 --> 27:18.994
You and him?

27:19.101 --> 27:22.366
He breaks down our fences,
he chops down our trees,

27:22.504 --> 27:24.631
he trespasses on our property,
and you...

27:24.773 --> 27:25.933
Grandpa, just listen.

27:26.041 --> 27:29.067
Of all the people in the world,
you bring him over my threshold?

27:29.178 --> 27:31.544
Hold on here, Jack.
We can talk about this.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.204
Mr. Bartlett to you!

27:33.315 --> 27:34.976
Would you just let me explain?

27:35.084 --> 27:36.483
At least he's not Jack the Ripper.

27:36.585 --> 27:37.244
What?

27:37.419 --> 27:39.944
You. You. Out.

27:40.019 --> 27:41.284
- But...
- Now!

27:41.390 --> 27:42.516
And I want you out, too.

27:42.624 --> 27:43.989
You are not welcome in this house.

27:44.126 --> 27:45.058
Grandpa! Wait!

27:45.194 --> 27:46.718
You and him can do
whatever you want,

27:46.829 --> 27:47.761
but not under this roof!

27:47.863 --> 27:50.229
- Would you stop yelling?
- What the hell is that noise?

27:50.332 --> 27:51.959
[Static from radio]

27:54.369 --> 27:55.768
Do you see? Are you happy?

27:55.871 --> 27:58.135
This is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

27:58.974 --> 27:59.804
AMY:
<i>Grandpa?</i>

27:59.908 --> 28:01.239
Amy?

28:01.343 --> 28:03.573
<i>Grandpa, are you there?</i>

28:03.679 --> 28:05.237
Amy, are you okay?

28:05.347 --> 28:07.941
I'm fine, but Ty is sick.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.176
How sick?

28:12.421 --> 28:13.615
Grandpa, he's really sick.

28:13.722 --> 28:15.417
He can't drive, and I'm afraid to.

28:16.091 --> 28:18.958
Don't even think about driving.

28:19.061 --> 28:21.791
Grandpa, it's snowing
really bad here.

28:22.965 --> 28:24.830
I'll come and get you.

28:24.933 --> 28:26.093
I don't think you can.

28:26.201 --> 28:29.102
Don't you tell me
what I can and can't do.

28:29.204 --> 28:32.196
Okay. I'm just saying the road
through the mountains is closed.

28:32.307 --> 28:33.899
We had to turn back
ourselves, so...

28:39.248 --> 28:42.581
JACK: <i>Amy, listen.</i>
<i>The highway's closed.</i>

28:43.519 --> 28:45.544
Grandpa, I can't hear you.

28:45.654 --> 28:50.284
I said the highway is closed.

28:53.562 --> 28:55.928
Okay.

28:57.232 --> 28:59.723
We'll be fine.
We'll stay here.

29:00.969 --> 29:03.130
We'll be fine.

29:09.812 --> 29:10.779
Hi.

29:11.246 --> 29:12.770
Hi.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.746
What's wrong?

29:14.850 --> 29:17.045
Nothing. I just...

29:17.152 --> 29:19.950
Well, I just needed to talk to you
because I was worried

29:20.055 --> 29:22.819
that you said
you were pining over this...

29:22.925 --> 29:24.222
Over Caleb.

29:25.561 --> 29:28.291
Look, Ashley, I fought with myself
all the way over here

29:28.397 --> 29:30.627
because I really didn't
want to say anything.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.394
But you need to know the truth.

29:32.534 --> 29:33.296
What truth?

29:33.402 --> 29:35.597
You're making a lot
of really bad decisions right now

29:35.704 --> 29:38.036
because you are
under the misguided perception

29:38.140 --> 29:39.164
that you know this guy.

29:39.274 --> 29:40.138
I do.

29:40.242 --> 29:42.142
No, honey, you don't.

29:42.244 --> 29:45.042
He hooked up with you
because he saw an opportunity.

29:45.147 --> 29:46.205
Money, right?

29:46.315 --> 29:49.079
You have this strange,
twisted view of the world.

29:49.184 --> 29:51.277
Not everyone
is motivated by money, Mom.

29:51.387 --> 29:53.355
Especially Caleb.

29:53.455 --> 29:54.922
Is that right?

29:55.024 --> 29:57.356
Then why did it take him
less than 10 seconds

29:57.459 --> 29:59.393
to accept my sponsorship money?

30:00.496 --> 30:02.726
Oh, he didn't tell you?

30:02.831 --> 30:04.731
Well, of course he didn't.

30:05.167 --> 30:08.694
I gave him a check so he could go
on his little rodeo circuit.

30:08.871 --> 30:10.566
You paid him to go away?

30:10.673 --> 30:12.231
No. Uh-uh.

30:12.341 --> 30:15.868
He wanted to go away.
I just made it possible.

30:15.978 --> 30:16.672
Get out.

30:16.779 --> 30:18.747
Ashley, why are you angry with me?

30:18.847 --> 30:20.178
He took the money.

30:20.282 --> 30:21.613
You only paid him for one reason.

30:21.717 --> 30:23.241
To get rid of him!
To buy him off!

30:23.352 --> 30:26.446
Yes, sweetheart.
And he was bought.

30:28.524 --> 30:31.516
I want you to leave. Now.

30:35.280 --> 25:26.454
Well. Okay.

30:54.149 --> 30:57.016
I don't care what it takes.
How many plows have we got?

30:57.119 --> 30:58.245
So, use one of them.

30:58.353 --> 31:02.221
Look, I want the road cleared
by sunrise.

31:02.725 --> 31:04.693
He'll get it done, Grandpa.

31:04.793 --> 31:06.920
You'll be able to drive out there
first thing.

31:07.029 --> 31:09.964
He's a good guy.
Please try to understand.

31:10.065 --> 31:13.466
Lou, you need to realize
that it's pretty much in my blood

31:13.569 --> 31:15.059
to hate these oil guys.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.797
That's how I felt before, too.

31:16.939 --> 31:19.806
But I've gotten to know him,
and he's not just an oil guy.

31:19.908 --> 31:21.705
Well, I haven't gotten to know him.

31:23.278 --> 31:27.908
And it's gonna take me some time
to get used to you dating the enemy.

31:29.551 --> 31:32.748
So, I got one of my guys to take
a plow to your road at dawn.

31:32.855 --> 31:34.254
Great. Okay.

31:35.724 --> 31:37.385
Yeah, we'll get you there.

32:34.917 --> 32:35.576
Ty.

32:40.122 --> 32:42.090
I'd do anything for you.

33:10.219 --> 33:11.277

33:11.386 --> 33:12.182
Morning.

33:12.354 --> 33:14.720
How you feeling?

33:14.823 --> 33:16.256
Better.

33:19.795 --> 33:22.423
Well, your fever's gone.

33:24.032 --> 33:27.365
No wonder.
It's freezing in here.

33:52.594 --> 33:55.358

34:37.606 --> 34:38.630

Hey, boy.

35:33.161 --> 35:34.719
Hey.

35:55.684 --> 35:58.175
Okay.

35:58.687 --> 36:02.123
I know you don't think so,
but we can be friends.

36:02.224 --> 36:03.748
I mean, we are friends, right?

36:03.859 --> 36:05.190
Just...

36:05.293 --> 36:07.523
We can be more than that.

36:07.629 --> 36:09.426
We need to be
more than that 'cause...

36:11.767 --> 36:14.895
'Cause I love you.

36:15.070 --> 36:16.901
I always have, and...

36:17.005 --> 36:20.270
Look, I know I've screwed up.

36:20.375 --> 36:24.471
More than a few times. I know.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.408
I love you so much.

Okay. Great.
No, that's fine. Thanks.

36:47.969 --> 36:49.095
Thank you.

36:49.204 --> 36:52.503
Okay, so, my guy's out there now.

36:52.607 --> 36:54.006
He plowed the road to your cabin.

36:54.109 --> 36:55.736
He says the other ones
will be open soon.

36:55.944 --> 36:58.674

36:59.513 --> 37:00.346
We?

37:00.348 --> 37:01.713
Yeah, I'll come with you.

37:04.252 --> 37:06.482
Fine.

37:08.256 --> 37:10.690
Oh, here.

37:11.092 --> 37:13.492
Take this with you.

37:14.829 --> 37:16.296
And drive carefully, okay?

I will.

- See you in a little bit.
- Okay.

37:30.879 --> 37:33.313
Amy! How the heck
did you get here?

37:35.350 --> 37:36.977
We followed this big plow.

37:37.085 --> 37:40.111
It was from Bedford Oil.
I don't know how they got there.

Ty. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

37:42.324 --> 37:44.588
I'm okay.

37:46.027 --> 37:47.494
You look like hell.

37:47.596 --> 37:49.120
I'm a little sick.

37:49.231 --> 37:50.789
Amy.

37:54.936 --> 37:57.496
Internet guy.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.732
Hey. You okay?

38:01.843 --> 38:03.310
Yeah.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.708
Are you?

38:07.415 --> 38:09.110
Yeah.

38:09.217 --> 38:10.980
I think so.

38:11.086 --> 38:13.111
Come on.
I'll tell you all about it, okay?

38:13.221 --> 38:15.553
You better.

38:28.770 --> 38:30.032
Ashley!

38:30.138 --> 38:31.765
Ashley!

38:32.874 --> 38:35.240
Hey. There you are.

38:39.314 --> 38:40.645
Surprised?

38:40.749 --> 38:41.681
Yeah, you bet.

38:42.517 --> 38:46.317
Well, it's great to be back and...

38:46.421 --> 38:48.548
I missed you a lot.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.355
There's something I got to tell you.

38:51.526 --> 38:54.962
Well, I have something
I want to tell you, too.

38:58.833 --> 39:01.028
Get the hell out of here!

39:02.103 --> 39:02.899
Leave!

39:08.043 --> 39:10.773
And take these, too!

39:16.284 --> 39:18.013
So...

39:18.153 --> 39:21.122
Thanks for what you did.

39:21.222 --> 39:23.281
Oh, hey. Anytime.

39:23.391 --> 39:25.859
Got to rally around
when there's an emergency, right?

39:26.861 --> 39:29.762
You never know when you're
gonna be in a jam yourself, so...

39:29.864 --> 39:31.729
My pleasure.

39:41.676 --> 39:45.942
Don't worry too much about him.
Just give him 20 years or so.

39:46.047 --> 39:47.742
Yeah, right.

39:47.882 --> 39:51.147
Hey, look. I'm sorry.

39:51.252 --> 39:55.052
Right from the start,
I should have told them about us.

39:55.156 --> 39:58.592
If there even is an us anymore.

40:00.929 --> 40:03.727
Well, I guess that road's open
about now.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.661
I mean, we could probably
make a late lunch

40:07.769 --> 40:08.758
in the hotel if you want.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.437
- I'll get my bag.
- It's still in the truck.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.370
Okay, go.

40:13.475 --> 40:14.999
Come on!

40:16.010 --> 40:18.376
Well, look at you.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.475
Next thing, I suppose
there'll be dirty socks

40:21.583 --> 40:23.073
lying all over the place.

40:23.184 --> 40:25.049
This is just temporary, Jack.

40:25.153 --> 40:27.781
Well, it better not be.

40:31.526 --> 40:34.290
Remember a long time ago
I warned you

40:34.396 --> 40:37.422
about getting anywhere
close to my granddaughters?

40:37.532 --> 40:40.126
Nothing happened, Jack.
Obviously.

40:40.235 --> 40:44.035
Okay. Maybe not.

40:44.139 --> 40:46.403
But no kissing
and running this time.

40:46.508 --> 40:47.497
You get my drift?

40:49.778 --> 40:51.973
Yeah, Jack.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.707
I get it.

41:13.768 --> 41:14.632
Jack.

41:15.770 --> 41:17.328
Tim.

41:23.211 --> 41:24.178
What's this?

41:24.279 --> 41:26.440
It's a little something
to help you out.

41:26.548 --> 41:29.312
Should be enough to tide you
over for a year or so.

41:29.417 --> 41:31.351
No. Jack, I appreciate it, but no.

41:31.453 --> 41:33.387
Don't be an ass.

41:33.488 --> 41:37.015
The thought of being boxed in
by Val Stanton on two sides

41:37.125 --> 41:39.093
is more than I can bear.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.430
Beautiful country.

41:47.535 --> 41:48.729
Yeah, it is.

41:49.704 --> 41:52.502
You don't want to sell that.

41:55.043 --> 41:56.476
I'll pay you back, Jack.

41:56.578 --> 41:58.671
Well, don't be in too big a hurry.

41:58.780 --> 42:02.580
I'm planning on gouging you
on the interest.

42:10.558 --> 42:12.583
More tests?

42:12.694 --> 42:15.754
Well, we just got the results back
from the last ones.

42:15.864 --> 42:18.264
Everything was fine.

42:21.603 --> 42:23.833
I see.

42:26.674 --> 42:27.834
Yeah.

42:27.942 --> 42:30.172
Wednesday, next week, 8:00 a.m.

42:30.278 --> 42:32.212
I'll be there.

42:39.521 --> 42:42.115
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

42:56.571 --> 42:58.061
Promise you won't let me win, okay?

42:58.172 --> 43:00.663
- Then, there's no game.
- You wish.

43:00.775 --> 43:04.006
Oh, excuse me.
Are we intruding?

43:04.112 --> 43:05.477
- Yes.
- Yes.

43:05.580 --> 43:09.072
Don't catch what he's got, Amy.

43:09.551 --> 43:11.951
Finally!

43:14.989 --> 43:16.456
So, how are you feeling?

43:16.558 --> 43:19.083
Better. Much better.

43:19.193 --> 43:21.127
Good.

43:21.229 --> 43:24.528
You weren't delirious, were you?

43:24.632 --> 43:27.430
You know, when you told me...

43:27.535 --> 43:28.593
No.

43:28.703 --> 43:29.829
No?

43:29.938 --> 43:30.836
Were you?

43:30.972 --> 43:32.667
No.

43:32.774 --> 43:33.399
Were you?

43:33.508 --> 43:34.998
No.

43:35.908 --> 43:37.098
Say it.

43:38.446 --> 43:39.936
Come on.

43:42.283 --> 43:44.308
Say it.

43:51.292 --> 43:53.157
I love you.
