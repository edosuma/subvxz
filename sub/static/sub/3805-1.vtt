00:58.867 --> 01:00.479
Okay.

01:00.804 --> 01:02.416
So it's you.

01:04.299 --> 01:07.894
Check wind direction.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.222
Find it in the crosshairs.

01:11.421 --> 01:13.033
And when you're ready ...

01:14.245 --> 01:15.857
Slip mig far.

01:22.935 --> 01:26.522
Danish texts: Sublime

02:57.059 --> 03:00.083
London, United Kingdom.

03:03.259 --> 03:05.180
- I'm late. - Yes, sorry.

03:05.523 --> 03:08.309
- You should have called. - I have apologized.

03:10.027 --> 03:14.995
- Have you hygget you? - Yes. It was great.

03:15.143 --> 03:19.230
Hopefully not a weekend with video games and junk food.

03:19.231 --> 03:21.266
We've just been around.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.027
Are you trying to reassure me it does not.

03:24.635 --> 03:26.290
Stop nu.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.930
He's not so bad ...

03:27.931 --> 03:29.785
Not today.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.965
- Goodbye dad. I love you. - Love you too.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.333
Be good to your mother.

03:39.197 --> 03:42.836
- She is quick high. - They do.

03:43.468 --> 03:45.080
How ... what's his name?

03:45.652 --> 03:47.264
Nigel.

03:48.060 --> 03:53.061
- His name is Neil. He is ok. - Is he serious?

03:54.516 --> 03:58.825
- It will not really you know? - Trying just to get a conversation started.

03:58.826 --> 04:01.210
A pity you did not try it when we were married.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.822
Goodbye, Sam.

04:07.482 --> 04:11.875
Alicante, Spain 24 hours later.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.598
Okay, folks. Let's get started.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.959
Say when you have contact with the target. I want you to shadow him.

04:22.269 --> 04:25.668
The call can come at any moment. And when it does, we have to be ready.

04:25.669 --> 04:27.853
The goal in sight. Turn east.

04:28.237 --> 04:29.849
Vent.

04:31.157 --> 04:32.769
Vent.

04:33.861 --> 04:35.468
Move out.

04:35.469 --> 04:38.678
He took the phone out. Maria. Start tracking it.

04:42.173 --> 04:45.142
I want to know what he says and who he talks to.

04:45.797 --> 04:47.409
Say something!

04:47.638 --> 04:51.422
- The number is not known. - So find it quickly.

04:56.963 --> 05:01.294
We do not get a clear signal. Follow him close to the microphone.

05:01.295 --> 05:03.358
Men hold afstand.

05:04.984 --> 05:07.241
Tell what he says.

05:07.555 --> 05:09.055
Give me something!

05:09.056 --> 05:12.537
- I think he said a plan ... - You think?

05:12.832 --> 05:16.817
- Tell him to closer. - Are we closer we get ...

05:19.956 --> 05:22.795
The goal fleeing.

05:22.796 --> 05:26.432
Damn! Charlie 3 Say you have an eye on him.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.169
Confirmed. He is on the way north through the market.

05:33.296 --> 05:34.908
Shoot.

05:35.392 --> 05:40.394
- What? - I repeat. Charlie three, shoot.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.402
Damn!

05:47.606 --> 05:50.789
For God's sake, is there any?

05:50.790 --> 05:53.247
Tell me if I got the bastard.

05:57.697 --> 06:02.281
Vauxhall Cross MI6. 48 timer senere.

06:09.914 --> 06:12.611
What a mess.

06:12.922 --> 06:15.895
The information came from one reliable source in Spain.

06:15.896 --> 06:18.240
- We have no reason to ... - Young man -

06:19.152 --> 06:23.305
- Fernando Lopez. He was only 23 years.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.737
He and his girlfriend -

06:26.048 --> 06:28.097
- Planned their wedding.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.361
They had time in the church.

06:30.672 --> 06:32.969
- They had chosen the equipment. - It was -

06:34.264 --> 06:36.458
- Unhappily. - Miserable!

06:36.792 --> 06:40.169
Our Lord preserved. The media has got wind of it.

06:41.432 --> 06:44.327
I can not just sweep it under the carpet.

06:44.328 --> 06:47.041
I would expect that either.

06:48.672 --> 06:52.513
- What do you expect? - How about a little thing called loyalty.

06:53.457 --> 06:56.994
It sounds like an old-fashioned concept, but once meant something here.

06:57.656 --> 07:00.833
There was a time I could trust, someone covered my back.

07:01.192 --> 07:04.097
Now he has to hurry, to cover themselves.

07:06.080 --> 07:10.415
- Remember who you're talking to. - Come on, Monty, not all that shit.

07:10.416 --> 07:12.449
- Hvabehar? - Of.

07:12.776 --> 07:17.217
Hiding behind thick walls while we are out there, defending the gates.

07:17.945 --> 07:20.425
I know this time we made a mistake.

07:20.721 --> 07:23.161
But what about all the times we do it well?

07:23.480 --> 07:25.092
What about them?

07:26.664 --> 07:31.743
- Even the Spaniards want your head. - And you are eager to deliver it -

07:31.744 --> 07:35.609
- On a silver platter with it all. - You gave the order.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.975
- You were behind the shot. - It had to be that way.

07:38.976 --> 07:40.993
I know it would be that way.

07:41.369 --> 07:44.049
Attack source you said.

07:44.056 --> 07:48.265
Prevents the dominoes from falling over, and here we stand now.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.794
I'm sorry, Bill.

07:53.410 --> 07:57.874
There will be a full investigation. You and your team are suspended.

07:58.849 --> 08:02.617
- With immediate effect. - Let me tell you something.

08:04.978 --> 08:06.590
Now listen.

08:06.914 --> 08:09.066
I could use a game of polishing.

08:09.938 --> 08:13.547
You're pretty good at polishing your halo.

08:18.613 --> 08:23.921
6 months later.

08:36.063 --> 08:39.616
How about I make one of my famous Spanish omelets?

08:40.832 --> 08:42.443
Sam?

08:42.936 --> 08:45.321
Sam. Vil du have en omelet?

08:45.961 --> 08:47.573
No, I am fine.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.586
Hello, sovetryne.

08:57.096 --> 09:00.121
- How are you here tomorrow? - I'm fine.

09:04.608 --> 09:08.335
Only cold me racist, just cold me fremmedhadsk -

09:08.336 --> 09:10.246
- Because you have the right to do so.

09:10.247 --> 09:14.021
But I represent the honest people of all races and religion -

09:14.022 --> 09:17.093
- In this country who are ashamed of the 7/7.

09:17.094 --> 09:18.728
Did you have last night?

09:19.420 --> 09:22.412
- Did you? - Yes. That was nice.

09:23.213 --> 09:27.877
- They refuse full time to participate ... - Are you okay?

09:27.878 --> 09:31.902
I'm fine. Why? You seem different.

09:32.541 --> 09:34.566
I hate? I want ...

09:34.567 --> 09:36.840
- Sam! - I watch the news.

09:37.169 --> 09:40.833
We will integrate people and wants them get a better life ...

09:40.834 --> 09:46.837
- Let's have lunch. I invite. - A 700 years old book -

09:46.838 --> 09:52.949
- There has been misinterpreted and messing people into an incomprehensible power struggle.

09:52.950 --> 09:55.463
We are a multicultural nation.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.434
- Every religion ... - What is it?

09:57.435 --> 10:01.689
- Which we take for us ... Is not yours?

10:03.206 --> 10:05.277
I'm so stupid.

10:05.278 --> 10:09.566
You can call me an extremist. I am extremely against extremism.

10:09.949 --> 10:14.861
I represent people who want to be safe and not threatened by -

10:14.862 --> 10:18.869
- Minority groups that are hiding behind the word racism.

10:18.870 --> 10:22.732
The government must secure the border better.

10:22.733 --> 10:27.301
But they can not because the majority of those who protect our borders -

10:27.302 --> 10:31.852
- Recruited from those populations, we want a diskussion with.

10:31.853 --> 10:35.404
Many of our hardworking border guards -

10:35.405 --> 10:40.422
- Infiltrated by the people we are trying to keep out.

10:41.166 --> 10:44.499
You know what Americans call our capital city, London?

10:44.500 --> 10:47.314
What the US security services call London?

10:47.315 --> 10:50.763
Londonistan. We are direct embarrassing that country.

10:50.764 --> 10:53.660
Because the government has ignored every word we say.

10:54.004 --> 10:57.291
It must be stopped. It is a problem to be solved.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.909
Not by force but through debate ...

11:04.957 --> 11:10.507
Sam Blake?
Sam Joseph Blake?

11:10.891 --> 11:14.203
- Yes. - I already feel that I know you.

11:14.843 --> 11:16.455
Who is it?

11:16.610 --> 11:18.617
Kald mig Jericho.

11:18.618 --> 11:21.282
Whatever you want, I'm not interested.

11:21.283 --> 11:25.185
- I think that you will be. - No thanks.

11:25.186 --> 11:27.235
I would ...

11:49.419 --> 11:51.796
Do I have your attention now?

11:52.483 --> 11:54.034
What the hell is this?

11:54.035 --> 11:59.938
You are an articulate man, you need not spend so ugly language.

11:59.939 --> 12:03.516
- Oh please. - No, you listen to me.

12:03.888 --> 12:07.321
I will tell you about the nature of terror.

12:07.624 --> 12:12.288
It is a primitive instinct. When it strikes, it's serious.

12:12.289 --> 12:15.526
It will be an independent entity. It is palpable.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.608
It is all-consuming.

12:19.198 --> 12:24.261
One can feel the terror, smell it and taste it.

12:24.262 --> 12:28.503
It is greedy and waxes. It involves uncertainty.

12:28.838 --> 12:32.214
Can anyone not help?

12:32.215 --> 12:35.541
Stop now. Whatever it is that you want to emphasize -

12:35.542 --> 12:39.885
- I have made it. - No, not now, but later.

12:39.886 --> 12:43.022
People out there living in the delusion -

12:43.023 --> 12:46.562
- at de en dag rammer
den store jackpot i lotto -

12:46.563 --> 12:49.746
- Or bring in et famous reality show -

12:49.747 --> 12:53.026
- Or that the government will rescue them no matter what they do.

12:53.027 --> 12:56.170
You and I, Sam, we are of a different nature.

12:56.171 --> 12:58.313
We have seen what is behind the curtain.

12:58.314 --> 13:03.059
We have looked into the abyss. We know that the nodule is malignant.

13:05.339 --> 13:06.839
Celebrating!

13:06.840 --> 13:11.161
What I said about foul language, Sam? Do not challenge me.

13:11.519 --> 13:14.232
No more shooting?

13:15.056 --> 13:18.272
So I would ask for consideration.

13:20.135 --> 13:23.806
I hear you. I know that, Sam.

13:23.807 --> 13:25.419
I know what you are.

13:25.696 --> 13:28.679
If for a moment forget that you are employed by the government -

13:28.680 --> 13:31.040
- You look like me.

13:31.098 --> 13:32.598
Listen up.

13:32.599 --> 13:34.786
You hold all the trumps -

13:34.787 --> 13:36.287
- You're in full control.

13:36.288 --> 13:39.936
No matter what I do I will do it.

13:40.241 --> 13:42.128
The kom det.

13:42.432 --> 13:45.168
I wondered when the training would take over.

13:45.488 --> 13:49.814
Build relationships. Ignoring differences. Achieve confidence.

13:49.815 --> 13:52.158
Okay, we'll play it.

13:52.159 --> 13:57.902
But this is not a negotiation. You can not manipulate me.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.598
You are not smarter than me. Remember it.

14:01.599 --> 14:03.211
And what do you want?

14:03.551 --> 14:06.112
You must kill me.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.958
Six people.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.430
At the time.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.647
Hver time.

14:10.648 --> 14:13.291
Seks timer, seks mord.

14:15.258 --> 14:17.681
There is a car for you outside.

14:17.682 --> 14:21.689
You can find the key in the blue trash can at the main entrance.

14:21.690 --> 14:25.255
The clock is ticking, Sam. It's time to go.

14:59.718 --> 15:03.861
Take the watch on. All times are London time.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.292
If you miss a deadline, people will die.

15:06.293 --> 15:08.636
If you call the police, people will die.

15:08.637 --> 15:12.015
Any deviation and delay, people will die.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.273
Do you understand?

15:15.246 --> 15:17.471
I asked you a question, Sam?

15:19.093 --> 15:21.845
- Yes I understand. - I hope so.

15:22.126 --> 15:24.014
I hope it really.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.991
No no no!

15:29.593 --> 15:33.215
Hell! She is a wildcat.

15:33.527 --> 15:35.550
She fought really.

15:36.863 --> 15:38.720
Today's children.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.791
Six goals, six hours. Understood?

15:44.086 --> 15:46.863
I've made it.

15:50.359 --> 15:56.648
Mål nummer 1,
Malden Road, E96EP.

16:15.338 --> 16:17.139
It's good, Lexi.

16:18.915 --> 16:23.939
Really good.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.118
Right there.

16:30.243 --> 16:32.995
You're completely filled with rheumatism.

16:35.451 --> 16:37.659
It has been a few stressful months.

16:39.282 --> 16:41.859
Og and timer intense.

16:43.218 --> 16:44.830
You're really good, you know?

16:45.466 --> 16:47.078
You are now not so naughty.

16:47.418 --> 16:49.030
For an old man, to be?

16:49.259 --> 16:50.915
So old are you better not.

16:52.842 --> 16:54.556
It is not how old you are -

16:54.858 --> 16:56.484
- That's how young you feel.

17:01.528 --> 17:04.535
Why do not you come and soaps to me?

17:04.536 --> 17:07.154
Russell, du er uforbederlig.

17:08.433 --> 17:11.921
- Complaints are you? - Me? Never.

17:15.523 --> 17:17.136
Come on.

17:19.124 --> 17:20.736
What did you say?

17:21.405 --> 17:24.790
I said, get your sexy ass out here.

17:32.402 --> 17:34.014
What are you doing?

17:34.264 --> 17:35.876
Yoga.

17:36.569 --> 17:41.417
Yoga? I give you as not you money.

17:56.016 --> 17:58.842
You are sørme a flexible young girl.

18:17.877 --> 18:21.187
- Hey, Lexi. - I've got it. All.

18:21.188 --> 18:24.038
Good girl. I also trust you.

18:24.716 --> 18:26.773
You let him go now then?

18:27.117 --> 18:29.220
All things in due time, Lexi.

18:29.221 --> 18:35.178
First, you must send the files. They are encrypted. Do not open them.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.867
Be sweet and let me talk to him.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.796
The files, Lexi.

18:39.797 --> 18:42.221
Send files to me.

19:08.816 --> 19:11.727
- What now? - On the road stands a silver colored car.

19:11.728 --> 19:13.293
- Ser du den?
- Ja, jeg ser den.

19:13.294 --> 19:17.333
Take a deep breath and get a grip on yourself. You must take a walk.

19:17.334 --> 19:20.415
When you reach the car, fold up and tighten your shoelaces.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.840
- If the car is it? - Do not worry about it.

19:24.759 --> 19:28.189
- Tell me why you do it here. - Again, think nothing of it.

19:28.190 --> 19:30.807
Put the device fixed under the vehicle.

19:56.397 --> 20:01.862
Go to a safe distance. In the backpack you will find the trigger.

20:27.856 --> 20:29.468
Good boy.

20:37.683 --> 20:41.587
Eight victims with a single shot to the head.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.173
Surely a hunting rifle.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.406
With the precision, it must be a professional.

20:48.052 --> 20:52.083
I want the whole area sealed off. No one in, no one out.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.401
I want the testimony of all. From all.

20:55.501 --> 20:56.701
What is it?

20:56.801 --> 20:59.195
There has been an explosion. Maybe a car bomb?

21:09.930 --> 21:11.683
Australia.

21:12.558 --> 21:14.679
Part of the realm.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.136
It was our catch colonial past.

21:17.438 --> 21:19.821
- Something different now, right? - Yes.

21:19.822 --> 21:22.310
If you want to "down under", you could a subject -

21:22.311 --> 21:25.783
- You must have money and something to offer.

21:26.695 --> 21:28.783
And there is nothing wrong with.

21:29.102 --> 21:32.405
Australians, they have thought of their economy.

21:32.406 --> 21:36.301
They have thought of the future. Australians are smart.

21:36.302 --> 21:38.805
Yes, and while smoking this country down the toilet.

21:38.806 --> 21:41.765
Filled with parasites, criminals and terrorists.

21:41.766 --> 21:43.410
Hell of scum, everybody.

21:43.411 --> 21:47.429
This is exactly the position we do not want people know.

21:47.529 --> 21:48.730
Shit.

21:48.830 --> 21:51.135
I'm not saying that I do not agree.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.607
I hold with eyelets.

21:53.955 --> 21:58.977
But this is all about, we need to show the British public that we are not

21:58.978 --> 22:00.909
A bunch of ignorant racists.

22:01.603 --> 22:04.826
We know how it feels to walk down the street -

22:04.827 --> 22:07.067
- Where we are in the minority.

22:07.068 --> 22:09.499
Surrounded by a culture that we do not understand.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.210
And that will not be integrated.

22:11.211 --> 22:15.547
We know how it is, not daring to take the bus. Imagine if you blew up.

22:15.548 --> 22:17.996
We are not the enemy.

22:19.612 --> 22:21.756
We stand in front of something big.

22:22.756 --> 22:27.195
But we need every patriotic men in this country -

22:27.196 --> 22:29.060
- That stand bag this.

22:30.388 --> 22:33.452
The first thing we have to deal with -

22:34.052 --> 22:36.156
- Is the perception.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.794
- Yes? - I am very pleased, Lexi.

23:34.795 --> 23:38.113
- You're letting him go? - There is just one more thing to do.

23:38.114 --> 23:40.633
I've done everything you asked for. Everything.

23:40.634 --> 23:44.218
You have spent a night with a billionaire and sent an email.

23:44.219 --> 23:46.853
- Not exactly hard, right? - Please.

23:46.854 --> 23:50.781
Just do as you're told, then it is fine. Trust me.

23:57.518 --> 24:00.127
Offeret hed Andrew Harris.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.711
38 years old, lives in the apartment right over there.

24:03.134 --> 24:06.279
We did not get anything out of his girlfriend. She was too upset.

24:07.734 --> 24:10.015
There are no surveillance cameras.

24:10.358 --> 24:12.831
Check whether there are others who watch.

24:14.318 --> 24:17.023
First shootings and now this. I wonder what is going on?

24:17.302 --> 24:18.914
I do not know.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.088
But I think there will be more.

24:22.878 --> 24:28.789
Explosive devices have always been the most powerful weapon in terror.

24:29.176 --> 24:33.639
Even the simplest devices can have the greatest efficiency.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.128
I am very aware of your expertise in this area -

24:37.129 --> 24:40.521
- And it would be foolish not to take advantage of this.

25:36.901 --> 25:41.281
Down on the ground! Both! Lie down! Do not look at me!

25:41.367 --> 25:42.979
Get your head down!

25:58.429 --> 26:00.041
Stay down!

26:11.366 --> 26:12.978
So what?

26:13.357 --> 26:15.468
- He is dead. - Excellent, Sam.

26:15.469 --> 26:17.676
- Two down, two to go. - No, that's enough.

26:17.677 --> 26:21.539
- It is over. I'm done. - Why do you say such a thing?

26:21.540 --> 26:23.099
There were witnesses.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.974
They were just there when I pulled the trigger.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.165
The so gun, so the car.

26:27.484 --> 26:29.683
- They saw me. - And you let them live?

26:29.684 --> 26:31.184
Yes, I let them live.

26:31.185 --> 26:37.016
I can see how it can do it all confusing. I must find a way out.

26:37.017 --> 26:38.560
It is enough. It is final.

26:38.561 --> 26:41.392
Let Joss go and we lost both of them, okay?

26:41.393 --> 26:45.635
He you seen the effect of a nitrogen bomb or a chemical explosion?

26:45.636 --> 26:48.331
You know what happens if you miss the deadline.

26:48.332 --> 26:51.300
I cut it out of cardboard.

26:51.301 --> 26:55.491
Can you live with that on their conscience?

26:56.292 --> 27:00.396
I have sent details of the next target, get it done now -

27:00.397 --> 27:02.757
- Then you are already halfway there.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.180
Can you describe the car?

27:12.587 --> 27:14.652
En sort SUV.

27:15.043 --> 27:19.718
Registration VI63-ZPZ.

27:20.826 --> 27:22.910
Give me a full ballistic analysis.

27:22.911 --> 27:24.541
The parking garage needs to be cleared.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.919
If anyone would complain, please send them to me.

27:27.822 --> 27:29.791
I leave you to cop Hayes.

27:31.823 --> 27:34.328
- Thank you. - We will soon be finished.

27:44.983 --> 27:46.483
Hvorfor her?

27:46.484 --> 27:49.606
Why at this time, which is filled with people?

27:49.796 --> 27:51.708
He must know that he would be seen.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.371
- It's obvious, right? - What?

27:53.372 --> 27:59.595
The man is a lunatic, psychopath soft in the bulb or what to say ?.

27:59.596 --> 28:02.164
It is an all too quick assessment.

28:02.165 --> 28:07.509
We must look at the connection between the victims, perhaps we can predict the next move.

28:07.656 --> 28:11.288
We have a description of the man and his license plate -

28:11.289 --> 28:14.426
- He is quickly caught. - When were you promoted, Hicks?

28:14.427 --> 28:15.927
18 months ago, why?

28:15.928 --> 28:18.650
It is not always that easy.

28:27.509 --> 28:29.843
- I want to talk to her. - Do not worry.

28:29.844 --> 28:32.014
Young Joss is doing well.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.324
I swear, if you hurt her ...

28:34.325 --> 28:38.085
Drop now superfluous and focus on the task.

28:38.263 --> 28:41.516
- Where are you? - Is there in two minutes.

28:41.517 --> 28:44.888
Tik tak, Sam.

29:26.684 --> 29:29.614
Damn it! Where are you?

29:30.252 --> 29:31.864
Where are you?

29:35.292 --> 29:36.904
Damn!

29:42.828 --> 29:44.757
Kom not kom not!

30:07.742 --> 30:11.966
It was 13 minutes late, Sam. Unacceptable.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.590
Hell!

30:18.130 --> 30:22.108
This is a nice little coffee shop. Do not you think?

30:38.788 --> 30:42.548
Konsekvenser, Sam.
Konsekvenser.

30:44.524 --> 30:47.659
- Extremely ... - He also sounded delicious.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.243
- Alone mold. - Who is this guy?

30:50.244 --> 30:52.269
Hey, what happens?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.205
Of the road.

30:55.804 --> 30:59.142
- Did you hear something? - No, I heard nothing.

30:59.708 --> 31:01.320
In do not want it here.

31:01.572 --> 31:04.597
The sums for the ears. I must have them cleaned.

31:04.900 --> 31:08.973
Did you hear nothing at all? Yes, I heard something.

31:54.297 --> 31:56.225
These are from last night.

31:56.481 --> 32:00.480
The girl is one of the first to be shot.

32:00.481 --> 32:04.297
The guy she's with, have keys. This means that he lived there.

32:04.449 --> 32:07.209
It brings it down to three possible people.

32:08.216 --> 32:11.457
We have him. His name is Blake. Apartment 16A.

32:12.088 --> 32:14.407
- Make a full background check. - Are made.

32:14.408 --> 32:16.409
- He is secretly piston. - What?

32:16.410 --> 32:19.852
The military intelligence service. The man is a secret agent.

32:52.745 --> 32:54.357
Hi.

33:04.068 --> 33:05.886
Hej, Lexi.

33:07.094 --> 33:10.439
- I do not do more before I see him. - Or what?

33:10.725 --> 33:14.509
Did not you hear the sirens a few blocks away?

33:14.510 --> 33:18.763
It, Lexi, is the sound of the impact.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.780
The worst of all sound.

33:22.058 --> 33:26.000
Another like you failed -

33:26.001 --> 33:29.673
- With a simple task and could not deliver.

33:29.674 --> 33:34.996
You should not disappoint me in the same way. Are you with?

33:38.179 --> 33:42.769
Do as I say and be reunited with your loved ones.

33:42.770 --> 33:47.124
But failure will be punished. Have you understood it?

33:47.402 --> 33:51.033
No more requirements, Lexi. No more threats.

33:51.034 --> 33:54.680
I have only one thing of you: -

33:54.681 --> 33:57.899
- "Your unconditional obedience."

33:58.538 --> 34:00.411
Have you understood?

34:01.426 --> 34:04.795
There is a bag next to you at the wall.

34:05.373 --> 34:09.819
Pick it up. Do not open it. Do not tamper with what is in the bag.

34:10.138 --> 34:15.732
Put it in your trunk. Sit in the car and head south.

34:16.081 --> 34:21.243
About five minutes you will receive further instructions.

34:21.570 --> 34:23.181
Come away.

34:32.714 --> 34:34.326
Er du okay?

34:35.873 --> 34:37.684
Sorry, I was a little uncomfortable.

34:38.050 --> 34:41.107
Hicks, look at me. You need to focus now.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.155
Are you ready for it?

34:43.443 --> 34:45.054
And.

34:45.202 --> 34:48.730
In the other cases, the shots fired with surgical precision.

34:48.731 --> 34:51.811
As there has been an object even though it is extremely.

34:52.219 --> 34:56.951
This is more random. Clumsy.

34:57.099 --> 34:59.155
So it is perhaps another killer?

34:59.563 --> 35:01.801
I do not know. Maybe.

35:02.704 --> 35:06.227
Surveillance cameras will show something, but in the meantime I have ...

35:06.228 --> 35:08.117
Who is responsible here?

35:12.763 --> 35:14.525
- Who is responsible? - It is me.

35:14.867 --> 35:17.378
- And you are? - I'll take it here.

35:17.379 --> 35:19.961
- Sorry? - Hopefully it will go faster.

35:19.962 --> 35:22.786
Show me some ID?

35:23.996 --> 35:25.496
Siddiq, ikke?

35:25.497 --> 35:28.097
I expect full cooperation with you and your team -

35:28.098 --> 35:29.696
- You should not expect.

35:29.697 --> 35:32.258
I'll take full responsibility.

35:36.881 --> 35:39.705
Phil, you said that you would be here early.

35:39.706 --> 35:42.018
- I really need ... - Roy.

35:42.497 --> 35:44.666
Call me soon as you hear it here.

35:45.098 --> 35:48.274
- Gaz, old friend, how are you? - Fine my friend.

35:48.275 --> 35:51.571
Look at yourself in your best clothes. It has cost the box, right?

35:52.282 --> 35:53.894
- I gotta fit in? - Yes.

35:54.354 --> 35:56.954
Come with me, I need to talk to you.

36:10.089 --> 36:14.578
- Where is Jacko and Big P? - Big P is out on an errand.

36:16.201 --> 36:18.338
He would contact me as soon as possible.

36:18.665 --> 36:21.219
Jacko your damn risk.

36:21.841 --> 36:23.369
I have not heard from him.

36:23.370 --> 36:25.066
I hope you let me down.

36:25.362 --> 36:26.974
I will not take nicely.

36:27.753 --> 36:31.088
- What about you? - I have a few buses on the road.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.088
- And someone coming by train. - Know the rules?

36:34.089 --> 36:38.416
- Yes. - I mean it, no weapons.

36:38.417 --> 36:41.929
No knives, no chains, not even a bloody knuckles.

36:41.930 --> 36:45.273
- If someone has something, it must be away. - It is sorted.

36:45.274 --> 36:47.826
Listen, I have a little surprise for you.

36:48.186 --> 36:52.401
I have been in touch with some old boys from the other side of the river.

36:52.402 --> 36:54.256
You probably know who they are.

36:54.257 --> 36:57.080
I have said that they should interfere with the other.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.745
Mingle with the crowd.

36:59.746 --> 37:03.090
- Maybe nod nastily or two. - Who said you could do it?

37:04.393 --> 37:07.060
- I'm doing you a favor. - I will not see them.

37:07.061 --> 37:12.168
I do not want them around, is that clear?

37:13.175 --> 37:14.942
I must think about it.

37:14.943 --> 37:17.232
- You give them the initiative. - Then let them?

37:18.800 --> 37:21.872
We start nothing.

37:22.487 --> 37:25.081
This is not to initiate anything.

37:26.739 --> 37:28.900
At least not yet.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.505
See? I said that it was him!

39:16.759 --> 39:18.371
Stop ham!

39:18.509 --> 39:22.144
Back! All retires! Back!

39:27.280 --> 39:28.892
Be there!

39:36.652 --> 39:38.264
Listen all together.

39:39.900 --> 39:42.253
Can I have everyone's attention?

39:44.749 --> 39:46.453
Silence!

39:48.483 --> 39:50.095
So.

39:50.483 --> 39:53.314
Before I continue, there is one I will present.

39:53.315 --> 39:55.155
This is Bill Weybridge.

39:55.452 --> 39:57.931
Earlier, the head of MI6.

39:58.683 --> 40:03.097
Blake was on his team, so he is here in an advisory role.

40:03.098 --> 40:05.872
We will focus on the following scenarios:

40:05.873 --> 40:11.322
A. Blake has been radicalized and recruited for terror?

40:11.658 --> 40:16.979
Or two. He's just a simple killer who turns on headshots.

40:17.869 --> 40:19.481
You are wrong.

40:21.518 --> 40:24.268
Sorry, Commissioner, you have something to tell?

40:24.269 --> 40:27.638
I will only observe that, in my opinion, you are mistaken.

40:27.998 --> 40:31.631
Are you sweet to elaborate?

40:31.974 --> 40:37.197
Weybridge, until Blake's expulsion, there was not a stain on him, right?

40:37.198 --> 40:40.756
Correct. Sam Blake is a highly decorated war hero.

40:40.757 --> 40:44.375
Do you think that in the last six months, he has become a terrorist -

40:44.376 --> 40:47.815
- Or built up a hatred for society?

40:48.165 --> 40:51.308
There are other options, but on the whole, yes.

40:51.309 --> 40:53.606
These are the most likely scenarios.

40:53.607 --> 40:58.532
In my experience, are "most likely", it most often is wrong.

40:58.533 --> 41:00.566
Thank you, Commissioner.

41:00.982 --> 41:04.415
- Your observations are noted. - I have not finished.

41:06.686 --> 41:09.647
The key to catch this man is to study his victims.

41:10.013 --> 41:13.911
On the surface they seem unconnected, but we have to look again.

41:14.285 --> 41:18.511
And if we do not find anything, we must look again and again.

41:19.141 --> 41:23.614
There must be something that links two, three or four of them together.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.543
Maybe someone who is trying to hide the relationship.

41:28.198 --> 41:32.399
When we found it, we can begin to determine the killer's motives.

41:32.973 --> 41:36.591
Set in the time I want results.

41:42.653 --> 41:45.479
Come brothers!

41:45.765 --> 41:48.311
Hurry up! Forward!

41:49.169 --> 41:52.411
We have an important mission. And today is a beautiful day.

41:57.629 --> 42:00.943
It was time, what took so long?

42:05.382 --> 42:07.375
God, is it?

42:07.662 --> 42:11.647
God! Where is my phone? Wait a minute.

42:12.838 --> 42:14.450
Give me the police.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.745
No!

42:17.358 --> 42:19.556
Suspect approaching from the north.

42:19.557 --> 42:22.933
Received, proceed with caution. The suspect may be armed.

42:22.934 --> 42:24.582
Stay where you are!

42:26.973 --> 42:28.585
Stop!

42:29.638 --> 42:31.250
Stop!

42:33.301 --> 42:34.913
Call gain!

42:35.790 --> 42:38.223
We are approaching the greenhouse.

42:38.501 --> 42:41.372
The suspect described as armed and extremely dangerous.

42:41.373 --> 42:44.999
Be careful, air support is expected in six minutes.

42:53.963 --> 42:55.653
Good afternoon officers.

42:57.628 --> 42:59.240
Alt okay?

43:01.524 --> 43:03.136
Have you seen this man?

43:04.307 --> 43:05.989
I think not.

43:06.579 --> 43:08.910
Either you have seen him, or have not you?

43:09.180 --> 43:10.792
What is it?

43:11.331 --> 43:14.941
I've never seen him before in my life.

43:17.526 --> 43:20.718
Okay.

43:21.010 --> 43:23.755
Get out of there right away, slowly.

43:24.947 --> 43:28.116
We need immediate reinforcement in the greenhouse now.

43:28.354 --> 43:29.972
Last chance!

43:35.890 --> 43:38.092
Down on the floor, hands behind your head!

43:39.307 --> 43:41.434
Keep your hands up!

43:41.435 --> 43:44.331
Do it! Take it easy!

44:02.253 --> 44:04.318
Reports to the control center.

44:04.574 --> 44:06.502
The suspect escaped.

44:10.855 --> 44:12.850
- Ja?
- Lexi?

44:13.419 --> 44:15.809
Onkel Tony, Gud, er du okay?

44:15.810 --> 44:18.515
- Has he done anything to you? - I'm fine, honey ..

44:19.086 --> 44:22.561
You should know that I do everything he asks me -

44:22.681 --> 44:24.939
- And I'll get you free. I promise.

44:25.059 --> 44:28.215
- I'll get you home. - Lexi, you're a good girl.

44:28.335 --> 44:30.348
Me and Aunt Sue, we love you.

44:30.596 --> 44:33.157
- Yes I know. - Look, Lexi.

44:33.277 --> 44:37.117
No matter what the shit planned, it happens no matter what you are doing.

44:37.237 --> 44:39.629
- But I'm ready. - How can you not say.

44:39.749 --> 44:41.610
Do not do more for him.

44:42.362 --> 44:46.289
Do you understand me, Lexi? He can go to hell ...

44:46.409 --> 44:47.665
Leave him alone!

44:47.785 --> 44:51.568
Very noble, but in the real world you are running out of family.

44:51.688 --> 44:54.195
And I know where Aunt Sue lives.

44:54.553 --> 44:56.935
I have a job for you, Lexi.

44:57.055 --> 44:58.501
Be ready!

45:07.853 --> 45:09.783
We approach os goal.

45:35.270 --> 45:37.424
He shoots at us!

45:48.974 --> 45:52.103
- They are at my heels! - Take the south exit now!

45:55.536 --> 45:57.240
Jump in!

46:04.547 --> 46:06.759
- Yes. - Yes?

46:07.189 --> 46:10.512
Thank you? I do not need thanks. I do not know who you are.

46:10.632 --> 46:13.816
I do not care what you've done. I do not know.

46:13.936 --> 46:17.305
And do not look at me! Stop it!

46:17.959 --> 46:20.025
I will not see your face.

46:22.297 --> 46:25.440
- What? - Let me introduce you to Lexi.

46:25.744 --> 46:28.872
She is, to put it bluntly, a whore,

46:28.992 --> 46:34.720
She prefers enough "escort", it sounds a little more respectable.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.872
Come on, Sam! Himself hello.

46:38.155 --> 46:39.536
Be it so!

46:39.656 --> 46:40.864
Hi.

46:41.264 --> 46:43.919
You and Lexi have much in common.

46:44.039 --> 46:48.191
Like you, she has proven to be a valuable resource.

46:48.311 --> 46:51.912
Tell her that she is doing incredibly well.

46:52.032 --> 46:53.967
He says you do it incredibly well.

46:54.087 --> 46:56.654
Tell her that I am very happy with her.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.505
- He said ... - I heard it.

46:59.625 --> 47:02.029
She is quarrelsome, right?

47:02.307 --> 47:03.919
I like her.

47:29.404 --> 47:31.631
Roy? Det er Pete. Hej.

47:32.449 --> 47:35.936
Take it easy! Take care of your heart. What's wrong?

47:36.847 --> 47:37.980
What?

47:38.226 --> 47:40.703
I also am just come home from a job in London.

47:42.496 --> 47:45.025
Just quietly, I come.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.825
Have I ever let you down?

47:49.503 --> 47:51.345
Precisely, look here.

47:51.663 --> 47:54.664
I get about 20 minutes. No more than half an hour.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.141
I order.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.956
Jill?

48:16.619 --> 48:20.058
It's hot and it's black. In addition, I can not promise anything.

48:23.433 --> 48:25.045
Why today?

48:26.164 --> 48:29.150
When there is twice as much police in the streets?

48:30.460 --> 48:32.198
Why not yesterday?

48:32.877 --> 48:34.489
Eller i morgen?

48:35.353 --> 48:38.813
Why make the effort to increase the risk?

48:39.437 --> 48:42.190
Do you think there is a connection between the shootings?

48:42.828 --> 48:44.670
It can not be a coincidence.

48:45.004 --> 48:47.677
Roy Dixon! What do you know about him?

48:48.390 --> 48:51.397
Han er en tidligere terrorist.

48:52.029 --> 48:57.222
Has degree in sociology and political science.

48:57.516 --> 49:01.237
When he was released from prison, he became politically active.

49:01.357 --> 49:04.117
Formed the Patriotic Alliance.

49:04.237 --> 49:06.973
He has been very busy the past 18 months.

49:07.285 --> 49:09.894
He is intelligent and charismatic, -

49:10.253 --> 49:11.918
- og han har en vision.

49:13.725 --> 49:15.337
He is dangerous.

49:19.756 --> 49:22.142
You should not underestimate her.

49:22.375 --> 49:23.686
What?

49:23.806 --> 49:25.488
Siddiq!

49:26.357 --> 49:28.317
She is very sharp.

49:29.031 --> 49:30.850
You should not shut her out.

49:30.970 --> 49:32.380
She can be a win.

49:32.500 --> 49:37.067
Listen Mr. Wade, we are very grateful for your valuable time -

49:37.187 --> 49:40.474
- But I have done something like this before.

49:40.594 --> 49:41.980
Do you have it?

49:42.575 --> 49:44.752
Frankly, you should go home.

49:46.280 --> 49:48.449
- You look tired. - I'm fine.

49:49.416 --> 49:51.318
Men tak for din omsorg.

49:51.438 --> 49:53.760
So let me put it a different way.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.518
I do not need you.

49:55.638 --> 49:59.827
- Get lost! - Listen, you little arrogant bastard.

50:04.130 --> 50:07.791
- Cares not to knock on? - When it's my own office? No!

50:07.911 --> 50:09.090
Something new?

50:09.210 --> 50:12.497
Some of the victims have connections to the Patriotic Alliance -

50:12.617 --> 50:16.026
- And at least two connections to hooligans.

50:16.753 --> 50:18.667
That you knew already, right?

50:19.543 --> 50:20.913
Close the door.

50:32.073 --> 50:34.534
What you hear now, being in this office.

50:35.561 --> 50:36.680
Understood?

50:37.937 --> 50:42.426
Roy Dixon was interesting since it Political Alliance began to grow.

50:43.065 --> 50:45.953
Six months ago, they were a credible threat.

50:46.073 --> 50:50.217
So we sent agents into among them.

50:50.337 --> 50:53.120
And it occurred to you not come to warn them?

50:53.240 --> 50:55.832
The Protocol provides that they should contact us.

50:55.952 --> 50:58.386
We contact under any circumstances them.

50:58.506 --> 51:01.377
- Inspector, you must understand! - Really?

51:01.497 --> 51:04.514
Are the sharpest in the British secret service?

51:04.634 --> 51:06.445
- No more of your kind. - Stop!

51:06.565 --> 51:07.851
My kind?

51:10.169 --> 51:12.196
- What I thought ... - Let me hear.

51:12.316 --> 51:14.005
What did you mean?

51:14.224 --> 51:17.479
I can promise you, Mr. Dalton, you can not call me anything -

51:17.599 --> 51:20.447
- That I have not already heard a thousand times.

51:20.567 --> 51:22.586
Do not make this into something it is not.

51:22.706 --> 51:24.241
Do not be so childish.

51:24.361 --> 51:27.305
You have no idea what's happening out there, right?

51:32.736 --> 51:35.480
Maybe she should have a sign and participate in the parade?

51:36.137 --> 51:37.749
From nar!

51:39.652 --> 51:42.765
Hicks! Come with me.

51:43.097 --> 51:44.709
Where are we going?

51:48.318 --> 51:51.061
DOWNING STREET 10 Taoiseach

51:53.964 --> 51:56.357
Is Cobra been informed?

51:56.891 --> 51:58.597
Not yet, Prime Minister.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.002
Not that?

52:04.107 --> 52:08.773
In this situation it may be appropriate to consider -

52:09.012 --> 52:10.773
- Alternative options.

52:15.794 --> 52:17.033
Explain!

52:17.761 --> 52:20.411
It seems that Mr. Blake -

52:20.689 --> 52:22.754
- Know Krudttønden.

52:23.336 --> 52:26.882
How can he know?

52:27.193 --> 52:30.426
In the last few hours, a few things have changed.

52:32.369 --> 52:35.977
The shootings, the cafe, what was it?

52:36.864 --> 52:39.922
Smokescreen shooting training, who knows.

52:42.208 --> 52:46.146
On any other day, we would not talk about it here -

52:47.136 --> 52:50.082
- But with tension simmering there.

52:51.025 --> 52:54.954
But if they ignite Krudttønden -

52:55.475 --> 52:57.499
- Do the gods alone know what happens next.

52:59.939 --> 53:06.492
- It's your choice, but ... - You need to hear me say that?

53:07.770 --> 53:11.949
I know the procedure.

53:11.950 --> 53:14.303
Obviously, Prime Minister.

53:17.399 --> 53:20.273
You know why I wanted to be prime minister?

53:21.591 --> 53:23.401
In order to make a difference.

53:24.016 --> 53:28.249
It may seem a bit naive, but it's true.

53:28.680 --> 53:31.758
I want to sit in that position.

53:31.759 --> 53:37.946
In order to make this country better.

53:40.576 --> 53:42.610
But not here.

53:43.856 --> 53:45.746
Never her.

53:48.962 --> 53:51.850
I gathers staff within an hour.

53:55.925 --> 53:57.524
No.

53:57.525 --> 54:02.132
We have a killer on the loose.

54:02.133 --> 54:04.478
He must be shot -

54:04.773 --> 54:07.797
- On-site.

54:12.696 --> 54:14.196
Found it.

54:14.197 --> 54:17.067
Put it in the back seat of the car.

54:17.068 --> 54:18.680
Gently.

54:24.300 --> 54:28.699
- Made. - The finish line is within reach.

54:29.781 --> 54:34.230
What do the police? When will this nightmare end?

54:34.231 --> 54:38.161
These are the questions people ask about the street.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.622
There are concerns everywhere ...

54:41.623 --> 54:44.849
Hey buddy. Have you seen the news?

54:44.850 --> 54:47.226
Someone has lost pacifier.

54:47.537 --> 54:49.819
They find equal everywhere now.

54:50.106 --> 54:52.371
I do not know what the city is going through.

54:54.685 --> 54:56.297
Vent.

54:56.445 --> 54:58.991
Relax completely.

54:59.573 --> 55:01.397
I do not want ballad.

55:01.398 --> 55:03.639
If it's money, so I download them straight.

55:04.646 --> 55:06.759
I do not want your money.

55:10.718 --> 55:12.350
Was it you?

55:14.293 --> 55:16.093
Yes, it was me.

55:17.758 --> 55:20.191
Listen, I'm just a taxi driver.

55:20.429 --> 55:24.910
I drive my car from A to B. I am nothing.

55:25.182 --> 55:26.794
Nonsense!

55:27.001 --> 55:28.501
Who are you?

55:28.502 --> 55:30.341
I'm not lying.

55:30.342 --> 55:32.318
What the hell are you?

55:36.077 --> 55:37.689
Listen -

55:40.296 --> 55:42.249
- I'm not who you think I am.

55:44.208 --> 55:46.017
You do not need to do this.

55:46.840 --> 55:48.452
Yes, I do.

56:05.123 --> 56:11.232
- He is dead. - You killed him quickly, really nice.

56:12.255 --> 56:15.495
Who is next?

56:15.496 --> 56:19.913
Try to hear yourself, a killer, a one man army. Unstoppable.

56:20.631 --> 56:24.015
- I just want my daughter. - Of course.

56:24.016 --> 56:29.817
I understand, do not worry, you will soon receive new instructions.

56:41.525 --> 56:46.754
- Friend t, wait, no panic. - How many people have you killed?

56:46.755 --> 56:48.367
I dag?

56:49.540 --> 56:51.744
- Five. - Do you want to kill me?

56:51.745 --> 56:54.040
- Of course not. - What if you need to?

56:54.041 --> 56:55.936
- So what? - He does not want you dead.

56:55.937 --> 56:58.864
How do you know? You have no idea what he has planned.

56:58.865 --> 57:01.320
You are not a strategic goal -

57:01.321 --> 57:03.913
- But the others are connected in some way.

57:05.912 --> 57:09.312
What is it? What is it?

57:09.313 --> 57:10.872
- I do not know. - What?

57:10.873 --> 57:13.063
- He gave it to me. - Have you seen him?

57:13.064 --> 57:15.591
- Not really. - What do you mean, right?

57:15.592 --> 57:18.519
I do not know, it was dark, I only got a glimpse.

57:18.520 --> 57:20.843
How did he look? Was he big, small?

57:20.844 --> 57:25.992
- He was plain, with black ski mask. - Where was it?

57:33.950 --> 57:36.406
- Yes? - How are you Sam?

57:36.407 --> 57:39.982
- You will not know. - Relax, this is what you do best.

57:39.983 --> 57:46.230
Kill the few to protect the many, You've done well until now.

57:46.231 --> 57:52.201
One like you, loner, degraded person, I can not imagine going to be -

57:52.202 --> 57:54.278
- glad for de
psykologiske vurderinger.

57:54.279 --> 57:58.951
But if you want to open up and talk about what happened in Spain -

57:58.952 --> 58:01.209
- så er jeg her for dig, Sam.

58:02.152 --> 58:03.856
Come to the point.

58:04.176 --> 58:09.835
- Just a killing anymore, so it's over. - Who?

58:10.423 --> 58:12.104
I say who is next?

58:16.322 --> 58:17.934
God, no!

58:19.844 --> 58:22.289
In the bag in the back seat -

58:22.290 --> 58:24.226
- er der en vest, -

58:24.227 --> 58:27.665
- i vesten er der en bombe, -

58:27.666 --> 58:30.921
- You must take the vest and participate in a procession -

58:30.922 --> 58:37.570
- Anti-Islamist group, the Patriotic Alliance, will go past an hour.

58:37.571 --> 58:41.531
If you try to disable it -

58:41.532 --> 58:45.075
- I will kill your daughter. - I'll blow myself up?

58:45.076 --> 58:47.233
I want you to help with the pain.

58:47.234 --> 58:50.209
And kill as many people as possible how?

58:50.210 --> 58:56.064
- Six you said six people. - Racists, Sam, New Nazis -

58:56.065 --> 58:59.507
- It's ridiculous that we call them people.

59:03.177 --> 59:05.769
- I would not do it. - Yes, Sam, will you.

59:06.016 --> 59:11.808
You will do it for Joss, and for the parents and children in mosques -

59:11.809 --> 59:16.928
- Listen to our highly respected Muslim who teaches them about the amazing Quran -

59:16.929 --> 59:21.833
- Without knowing about the explosives, which is a few meters from them.

59:22.137 --> 59:23.945
I'll call again.

59:25.329 --> 59:28.432
- Where was he? - In a prison a few kilometers away.

59:28.433 --> 59:30.928
- It was left ... - Okay, let's run.

59:30.929 --> 59:33.944
- You drive me over there. - Why do you think he is?

59:33.945 --> 59:36.092
- It's the only clue we have. - No no!

59:36.093 --> 59:39.279
- Absolutely not, he's my uncle. - He has my daughter.

59:39.280 --> 59:41.792
Okay, so do not gamble with her life.

59:41.793 --> 59:43.570
Do you trust suddenly on him?

59:43.913 --> 59:49.130
- You think he deliver them? - Do we have any options?

59:49.904 --> 59:51.762
We have a choice.

01:00:09.644 --> 01:00:12.020
Can I trust that everything is in order?

01:00:15.372 --> 01:00:21.149
If the payment is satisfactory?

01:00:23.467 --> 01:00:26.476
Not that being rude -

01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:29.413
- But time is short.

01:00:31.683 --> 01:00:33.295
Har du en pen?

01:00:43.026 --> 01:00:44.638
Okay.

01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:49.627
Have you heard of a pen?

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:58.014
So.

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.870
Sam Blake.

01:01:03.898 --> 01:01:06.819
The only thing that has struck me in a competition.

01:01:07.762 --> 01:01:12.203
For 25 years he was the most talented recruits in training.

01:01:13.913 --> 01:01:17.056
He was even eight hours in a camouflage suit

01:01:17.057 --> 01:01:21.131
hidden in a Somali scrub, -

01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:24.353
- And when the enemy showed his face -

01:01:24.354 --> 01:01:27.347
- Had Sam, a window of 30 seconds to shoot.

01:01:29.882 --> 01:01:31.494
One killings -

01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:34.013
- Prevented a massacre.

01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:39.353
I hope that your respect for him, does not influence your judgment.

01:01:39.427 --> 01:01:42.277
It stopped being a problem after he went berserk.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.832
You can keep the pen.

01:01:51.732 --> 01:01:53.492
Do not let me, Major.

01:01:54.451 --> 01:01:56.365
Jeg vil have Sam Blake, -

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:58.437
- udslet ham.

01:02:24.894 --> 01:02:27.235
- Are you sure it's here? - Yes, it is here.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.429
Stay with me.

01:03:11.462 --> 01:03:13.074
Who is it?

01:03:17.935 --> 01:03:20.214
You disappoint me, Lexi.

01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:24.041
I thought he meant more than a fat bank account -

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.051
- But I was wrong. - No!

01:03:27.234 --> 01:03:29.435
No!

01:03:30.226 --> 01:03:34.314
Stop! Nej! Nej!

01:03:43.131 --> 01:03:45.708
- Dit svin!
- Stop.

01:03:46.019 --> 01:03:48.489
What have I said about your language?

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.113
You did not have to kill him.

01:03:50.114 --> 01:03:55.011
You tried to trick me, I warned you against.

01:03:55.377 --> 01:04:02.001
Would you prefer that it was your daughter, with a bag over your head?

01:04:02.002 --> 01:04:03.904
I think not.

01:04:03.905 --> 01:04:08.297
I have known your exact position, from the moment you took the watch on.

01:04:08.298 --> 01:04:13.307
GPS tracking is a modern marvel, do not you think?

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.280
You have a little more than 52 minutes -

01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:18.640
- Use them wisely.

01:04:18.641 --> 01:04:20.988
It was my fault.

01:04:21.882 --> 01:04:24.696
- Come on. - It should have been me.

01:04:24.697 --> 01:04:27.059
- It should have been me. - Let's get out.

01:04:27.194 --> 01:04:31.481
What should we do, Sam? What's your big plan?

01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:33.218
We have nothing.

01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:43.977
Brethren, please welcome. Mr. Roy Dixon!

01:04:52.418 --> 01:04:54.030
Friends, -

01:04:54.386 --> 01:04:58.212
- Patriots to see you shoulder to shoulder -

01:04:58.514 --> 01:05:05.075
- Stand together against the British citizens claiming to be soldiers of Islam -

01:05:07.283 --> 01:05:10.227
- Warms my heart.

01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:15.451
I know you've put your rivalry aside -

01:05:15.755 --> 01:05:19.388
- Will have to stand together on this one purpose.

01:05:20.067 --> 01:05:24.204
Right now, becomes a holy war -

01:05:24.482 --> 01:05:27.356
- Of terror and cruelty -

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:31.892
- Planned behind closed doors.

01:05:32.275 --> 01:05:37.331
Of the hidden Islamic community in this country.

01:05:38.374 --> 01:05:44.068
These people hide behind their religion, build walls, -

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:46.991
- Suppressing and mutilate women -

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:52.663
- And educate their children to become soldiers and to kill us.

01:05:54.126 --> 01:05:56.655
But we say to them.

01:05:56.974 --> 01:06:00.519
Not anymore! Not anymore!

01:06:08.596 --> 01:06:12.484
We say to them, become integrated or traveling!

01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:19.799
Become integrated or traveling! And if they refuse to integrate.

01:06:19.978 --> 01:06:23.989
So we say to them.

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:27.196
Send dem hjem!

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:43.131
- Put me off. - No, no, you can not do it -

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:47.196
- I can not let you do it, you can not kill them, no matter who they are -

01:06:47.197 --> 01:06:49.742
- You just can not do it. - I have no choice.

01:06:50.566 --> 01:06:52.909
Put me off and leave London.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:56.538
- Get on with your life. - No.

01:06:56.742 --> 01:07:01.974
Okay, I have an idea, I have an idea, trust me.

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:06.667
He is at home around 8:00.

01:07:06.921 --> 01:07:08.533
And.

01:07:08.769 --> 01:07:10.388
Yes, how are the children it?

01:07:11.009 --> 01:07:12.641
Do they behave properly?

01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:16.418
The last thing I need is to come home to noisy children.

01:07:16.778 --> 01:07:18.402
And.

01:07:18.746 --> 01:07:20.358
Talk later.

01:07:21.626 --> 01:07:23.238
Russell.

01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:25.406
Lexi.

01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:29.243
- What are you doing here? - I missed you.

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:32.908
- It is a long time lately. - It is very sweet, honey.

01:07:34.204 --> 01:07:36.315
But I'm afraid I have a meeting.

01:07:36.316 --> 01:07:38.197
Kom nu, Russell.

01:07:38.484 --> 01:07:41.029
You can probably spend ten minutes on me?

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.093
I mean, think about what I can do to you in ten minutes.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:49.125
You do not expect that I pay for it, right?

01:07:49.612 --> 01:07:52.485
No, see it as a frynsegode.

01:08:00.096 --> 01:08:04.207
- What did you have in mind? - One thing at a time, Russell.

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:05.820
What the heck?

01:08:06.721 --> 01:08:10.686
Okay, Sam, det er min ven,
Russell Kincaid, -

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:13.918
- His company won the contract to upgrade the headquarters -

01:08:13.919 --> 01:08:17.353
- So he's pretty good at communication.

01:08:17.703 --> 01:08:19.377
Not true, Russell?

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:23.305
I need to know who finally called me?

01:08:23.865 --> 01:08:28.008
- I suggest you shut me out. - Answer her questions.

01:08:28.009 --> 01:08:32.232
I do not know. Why are not you asking?

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.546
Let's just say that it is not an option.

01:08:34.907 --> 01:08:37.883
So I do not know what to say.

01:08:38.564 --> 01:08:41.624
Okay. Here's what we do.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:46.169
Either you help me, or I'll tell your wife -

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:50.363
- Everything, down to the last detail.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:54.174
You do not.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:07.011
- This is very illegal. - Just do it!

01:09:07.013 --> 01:09:10.390
Become integrated or traveling!

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.124
He Han.

01:09:47.408 --> 01:09:49.290
Call amplification, now!

01:09:50.216 --> 01:09:53.769
Roy Dixon!

01:09:54.118 --> 01:09:57.002
Stop this march, for your people, that they turn ...

01:09:57.003 --> 01:10:01.362
- It is a lawful demonstration. - The ends here.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:04.929
- You're not sorry. - If you do not stop, someone will die.

01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:08.354
If you do not release me, you will be sued for assault.

01:10:08.355 --> 01:10:11.874
You can not control them, it is out of control.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.692
People will die, you will have it on their conscience?

01:10:14.995 --> 01:10:16.834
You miss five people, not?

01:10:16.835 --> 01:10:18.908
Soldiers loyal to the case.

01:10:19.202 --> 01:10:22.073
You are being fooled, Roy. Someone's using you.

01:10:24.642 --> 01:10:28.425
Like fireworks? Of course you can.

01:10:28.426 --> 01:10:30.635
This is spectacular.

01:10:30.986 --> 01:10:36.475
Look at those eyes. You really are your father's daughter, right?

01:10:37.505 --> 01:10:40.539
Five people, no explanation -

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.994
- It makes any sense to you?

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:47.297
- Where are they? - Murdered.

01:10:47.298 --> 01:10:49.674
Salted, shot, beaten to death.

01:10:49.675 --> 01:10:53.211
Maybe you will be the next, or him, or him, or him over there.

01:10:53.338 --> 01:10:56.076
There is something wrong, we know both.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:06.561
Roy, you have to stop it.

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:12.521
Back!

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:14.755
Back!

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.612
Back!

01:11:17.695 --> 01:11:23.287
- Go home! Back! It is over! - Back! This way!

01:11:23.288 --> 01:11:27.343
- Back! It is over. - What are you doing?

01:11:27.344 --> 01:11:29.729
- You are a skiderik? - Not today!

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.976
There will be another day.

01:11:34.296 --> 01:11:37.737
There will be another day.

01:11:58.572 --> 01:12:00.184
Police.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.633
- Satan. - What's wrong?

01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:06.023
A technical error?

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.642
Take it off.

01:12:11.438 --> 01:12:13.050
Slowly.

01:12:22.581 --> 01:12:24.677
What did you do, Sam?

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:29.715
Months of planning and preparation, and you destroy it.

01:12:29.716 --> 01:12:31.328
Shut up!

01:12:31.643 --> 01:12:33.255
I am here now, baby.

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:37.475
I got you.

01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:49.690
Hurry, get out.

01:12:49.691 --> 01:12:52.837
- No father, I am not leaving you. - Listen to what I say.

01:12:54.372 --> 01:12:56.205
Everything will be okay.

01:13:00.465 --> 01:13:02.690
You should not lie to the girl, Sam.

01:13:03.024 --> 01:13:08.162
To say everything will be okay, it's not okay, nothing is okay!

01:13:09.937 --> 01:13:12.330
Maybe she lives one more day -

01:13:12.648 --> 01:13:14.930
- A week or more years.

01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:17.306
What is the difference?

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.354
All she has in store, is suffering, failure and death.

01:13:22.705 --> 01:13:24.317
What is this all about?

01:13:25.897 --> 01:13:28.042
- Spain? - Spain.

01:13:29.256 --> 01:13:32.346
Throw a dart at a world map, Sam -

01:13:32.633 --> 01:13:37.912
- And the chance is that you hit something we're all about, but you know nothing.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.775
That killing innocent people -

01:13:39.776 --> 01:13:43.354
- What you gain by it? - How many people have you killed?

01:13:44.369 --> 01:13:46.330
Have you given up counting?

01:13:47.329 --> 01:13:50.834
You sleep guaranteed good night?

01:13:51.136 --> 01:13:55.615
Even when you have thrown bombs, you find a way -

01:13:55.616 --> 01:13:58.074
- To prove it to yourself.

01:13:58.376 --> 01:14:02.066
- You have no idea what has happened to me. - What a pity for you!

01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:05.442
All the women, poor you.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.090
When it goes beyond people like you, Sam -

01:14:11.433 --> 01:14:16.586
- Your own kind. So it must be very sure to understand? Is not it?

01:14:17.756 --> 01:14:23.463
I told you not? How rude of me.

01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:28.062
The people you killed today, with such accuracy -

01:14:28.701 --> 01:14:30.839
- var MI5.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:37.679
- Secret agents ready to attack. - You are lying!

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.522
Now you will begin to understand the true nature of terror.

01:14:42.801 --> 01:14:44.458
Do it.

01:14:45.065 --> 01:14:46.677
Do it now.

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:52.967
Even now, after all you've been through, you can not get yourself to it.

01:14:53.439 --> 01:14:56.616
Down on the ground, hands on his head. Hurry up! Do it!

01:14:59.943 --> 01:15:03.520
So you will be the hero who surrender?

01:15:04.119 --> 01:15:06.352
Banquet, humiliated?

01:15:07.535 --> 01:15:13.168
Even the old Scottish motherfucker, will laugh his ass off!

01:15:14.022 --> 01:15:16.504
Shut the hell up!

01:15:35.475 --> 01:15:37.087
Far?

01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:41.221
Come tax.

01:15:43.595 --> 01:15:46.429
I said, everything would be okay, right?

01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:52.782
- Er du okay?
- Ja. Og du?

01:15:56.315 --> 01:15:58.421
Dear God!

01:16:00.739 --> 01:16:02.351
Sam!

01:16:09.639 --> 01:16:13.197
All free units to the public car park -

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:15.928
- We received a call that suspects are on site.

01:16:37.651 --> 01:16:40.084
He has a pulse, but it is weak.

01:16:48.786 --> 01:16:50.398
And.

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:53.203
It looks like you need to have your bonus.

01:16:53.497 --> 01:16:56.841
- Why do you sound surprised, Monty? - Nonsense.

01:16:56.842 --> 01:16:58.866
I have never doubted for a second you.

01:16:59.218 --> 01:17:02.147
You've got a serious sur operated by you.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.195
Let me worry about it.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.936
No, leave it be.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.452
Welcome back to the living.

01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:32.108
Mit navn er Sir Alistair Montcrief.

01:18:32.395 --> 01:18:34.340
Monty, if you will.

01:18:34.947 --> 01:18:38.395
It is pleasure finally meeting them, Mr Blake.

01:18:41.442 --> 01:18:44.010
You made us a little worried there.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.460
But fortunately, the right skillful here.

01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:50.436
- Where is here? - Do not worry about it.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:53.818
- The men I killed ... Were they ... - I'm afraid.

01:18:55.121 --> 01:18:59.986
But believe me. We look after their families. We look after our own.

01:19:00.086 --> 01:19:02.387
I murdered them.

01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:05.393
And thus you have saved many thousands of people.

01:19:05.394 --> 01:19:08.906
They sacrificed themselves for the queen and the fatherland.

01:19:09.146 --> 01:19:13.772
- Would you like a cup of tea? - No fucking tea. I want out of here!

01:19:19.579 --> 01:19:21.724
The fact is that you are dead -

01:19:22.338 --> 01:19:24.603
- Officially, that is.

01:19:25.522 --> 01:19:28.292
Held memorial for you last week.

01:19:28.634 --> 01:19:32.050
I pulled a few strands, so you were acquitted and received a medal of honor.

01:19:32.051 --> 01:19:34.860
With great gratitude in every way.

01:19:34.861 --> 01:19:36.250
Wind, wind ...

01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:37.610
Hold on ...

01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:39.223
Am I dead?

01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:41.103
And.

01:19:44.683 --> 01:19:47.004
- I staged my death? - Exactly.

01:19:47.314 --> 01:19:50.881
We got decrypted Bill Weybridges phone -

01:19:50.882 --> 01:19:54.186
- From the one we got intelligence -

01:19:54.187 --> 01:19:57.620
- And it helped us a lot.

01:20:00.155 --> 01:20:04.060
- I want to see my daughter. - Unfortunately, it is excluded.

01:20:04.691 --> 01:20:08.421
Once you get better, peep at it here.

01:20:12.036 --> 01:20:13.648
You are in no hurry.

01:20:15.819 --> 01:20:17.549
I will contact you.

01:20:51.949 --> 01:20:54.278
Secrecy: Code Name Rogue.

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:12.721
Berlin, Tyskland.

01:21:12.722 --> 01:21:16.921
We live in a time where it's kill or be killed.

01:21:17.231 --> 01:21:21.457
Our enemies are developing and we have to adapt.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.961
We need someone who can work outside of normal procedure.

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:32.216
One that will not be kept on a leash system.

01:21:32.866 --> 01:21:37.746
In short, Mr. Blake, we need you.

01:21:37.747 --> 01:21:42.850
