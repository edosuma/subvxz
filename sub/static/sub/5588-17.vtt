00:01.300 --> 00:02.430
Pameron Tucker, you outdid yourself

00:02.469 --> 00:03.790
on these biscuits and gravy.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.900
They are so tasty, they make
you want to slap your mama.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.100
Am I right, Mitchell?
Sure. If that's a thing, why not?

00:08.300 --> 00:09.800
Bless your hearts.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.670
I'm fuller than a dog tick.

00:11.710 --> 00:12.970
Hey, just because they do it...

00:12.980 --> 00:14.270
It's the least I could do,

00:14.280 --> 00:15.780
Since you'uns opened your home to me

00:15.780 --> 00:17.280
For I don't know how many weeks now.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
Three.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.670
I just don't get it.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.880
How could he leave me? I know.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.550
I'm pretty.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.950
There's nothing I won't
let him do in the b-e-d.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.880
Hey, sweetheart, you're such
a big eater, aren't ya, huh?

00:28.890 --> 00:31.020
I can't believe I got left.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.130
Left!

00:32.130 --> 00:34.000
So, Pam got left.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.300
Her husband, bo,
took off with half their stuff

00:36.300 --> 00:38.830
when she was out rounding up
dazed piglets after a twister.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.690
I'm not kidding.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.800
I insisted she stay with us

00:41.800 --> 00:44.630
so I could help build up
her confidence again.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.500
Pam's self-worth has always been
tied to the attention of men.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.480
Which, you know, maybe isn't the
best thing for Lily to witness.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.480
What are you talking about? N-nothing.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.410
I'm probably just imagining it.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.680
I'm not imagining it.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.010
It could be him!

00:57.020 --> 00:59.150
That could be him, you guys!
It could be him!

00:59.200 --> 01:00.080
Get!

01:00.090 --> 01:02.390
That could be him! It could be him!

01:02.390 --> 01:03.520
It's not him.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.800
# Modern Family 7x17 #
Express Yourself
Original Air Date on March 23, 2016

01:21.040 --> 01:22.140
Wow, this is more reading than I did

01:22.150 --> 01:23.640
in my three years at a two-year college.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.810
I'm thinking chili dog,

01:25.860 --> 01:28.010
Just like pops --
may he rest in peace --

01:28.020 --> 01:29.990
Bought me at my first baseball game.

01:30.030 --> 01:31.350
May I be frank?

01:31.390 --> 01:32.580
We have a wiener.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.020
Oh, that's so weirdly sweet.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.280
And it's so cute
how your hair never moves.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.690
It's like a Lego. Mm-hmm.

01:37.690 --> 01:39.750
Hey, I know you!

01:39.760 --> 01:42.960
Coachella, dancing on top of my van.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.870
No, I just have one
of those faces that --

01:44.870 --> 01:46.170
It's Haley, right?

01:46.170 --> 01:48.300
Haley, would you like to introduce us?

01:48.340 --> 01:49.500
Um, okay.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.970
Andy, my boyfriend, this is...

01:52.020 --> 01:52.700
Tom. Tom.

01:52.710 --> 01:53.980
Tomtom.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.110
Is that cherokee?

01:55.110 --> 01:56.440
Uh...

01:56.450 --> 01:57.480
I should --

01:57.480 --> 01:59.080
Bye.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.840
I'm sorry.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.850
Hey, I know that you're
a little wilder than I am.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.150
It's one of the reasons
I fell for you. It's exciting.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.150
You don't have to say that.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.160
No, I mean it.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.030
You know what? Let's forget
about dinner and a movie.

02:13.030 --> 02:15.470
Let's do what wild Haley
would do instead.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.630
Honestly, I've been kind of ready

02:18.680 --> 02:20.900
For wild Haley to chuck
her party pumps in the trash.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.500
Or give them to charity,
blah, blah, blah -- whatever.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.510
But if that's one of the things
that andy liked about me,

02:25.510 --> 02:26.980
I wasn't gonna shut it down.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.380
Okay, well, we can start

02:28.380 --> 02:30.550
at this western place
where I know the bartender.

02:30.590 --> 02:32.550
If you hang back, I can get us
free drinks all night.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.720
It won't look weird, you ordering
two drinks every time you go up?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.320
No.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.520
Then let's turn this mother out.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.320
I got pretty lucky

02:41.360 --> 02:43.520
pulling that expression out of my fanny.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.860
I'm not usually so quick
with party talk,

02:45.860 --> 02:47.720
But I've always had this fear

02:47.730 --> 02:49.600
that Haley would think
I couldn't keep up with her,

02:49.640 --> 02:51.700
so I just tried to survive the night

02:51.700 --> 02:54.160
And not barf on my
dad's old church shirt.

02:56.540 --> 02:57.680
Claire?

02:58.910 --> 03:00.840
Claire?

03:00.880 --> 03:01.940
Claire?

03:01.940 --> 03:03.510
Can we watch the movie now?

03:03.550 --> 03:04.240
Honey?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.750
Answer him!

03:05.750 --> 03:07.680
Honey, please. I just have
to approve this proposal.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.680
I've been working on it all week.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.790
Oh...my...God.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.720
That's right.
Sun never sets on mama's empire.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.790
No, remember the travel
app we signed up for

03:16.830 --> 03:18.550
that gives you the last-minute deals?

03:18.560 --> 03:19.750
Huh?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.960
Three nights in Paris,
first-class airfare,

03:21.960 --> 03:24.790
four-star hotel for basically nothing.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.430
The flight leaves at noon tomorrow.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.970
We have five minutes to answer.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.400
Wait. You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

03:31.410 --> 03:32.640
It's kind of the deal of the century.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.140
Plus, we'd only miss one day of work.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.070
Haley's with Andy.
Luke's on a ski trip.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.580
I don't matter.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.450
Oh, sweetie, by the time we got there,

03:39.490 --> 03:41.620
we would be so messed up
on the time change,

03:41.660 --> 03:44.590
we would just wander around
in, like, a nauseous fog.

03:44.630 --> 03:45.650
Or you could just force yourselves

03:45.700 --> 03:46.820
to stay up all night tonight,

03:46.860 --> 03:48.150
then sleep on the plane tomorrow,

03:48.160 --> 03:49.630
and then when you land in Paris,

03:49.670 --> 03:51.090
your morning will be Paris' morning.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.150
There we go!

03:52.160 --> 03:54.120
Lucky for us, the smart one's home.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.800
It's such a sweet idea,

03:55.840 --> 03:58.730
but I am so tired from work this week.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.460
What is more energizing
than springtime in Paris?

04:01.470 --> 04:05.130
Baguettes baking, mimes miming,
skunks in love.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.770
This is what life is.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.940
C'est la vie, right? Nope.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.300
Joie de vivre.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.770
Better.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.980
Look, someday,
watching movies on the couch

04:12.980 --> 04:14.680
is the only thing we'll be able to do,

04:14.680 --> 04:17.610
but right now, let's fire a warning shot

04:17.620 --> 04:19.420
Right through father time's beard

04:19.420 --> 04:20.680
and spend a weekend in the eternal city.

04:20.690 --> 04:21.690
Rome.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.850
Emerald city.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.130
Seattle or Oz.

04:24.170 --> 04:26.190
She knows where I mean,
and the clock's running!

04:26.240 --> 04:27.860
You really want to do this, don't you?

04:27.900 --> 04:29.790
We'd be back Tuesday
with the story of a lifetime.

04:30.630 --> 04:31.990
Press the orange square.

04:33.130 --> 04:36.100
Pressez-vous le square orange.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.270
Yeah! We're doing it! Aah!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.040
Sorry, sleep! You'll have to wait!

04:42.090 --> 04:43.940
We're setting our watches to Paris time,

04:43.950 --> 04:45.210
Which is...

04:45.250 --> 04:46.340
nine hours ahead.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.450
Okay. Okay, it's 9:30 right now...

04:49.850 --> 04:51.110
Oh, my god! 6:30.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.090
6:30. Oh.

04:55.460 --> 04:56.890
How long's it take
to get the makeup off?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.520
I got out of Saigon faster.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.060
You like what walks out
the door every morning,

05:00.100 --> 05:01.460
so don't complain about the process.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.560
I got a floor sander in the garage

05:02.560 --> 05:04.390
if it'll open up the bathroom sooner.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.870
Aw, feeling a little put-out, Jay?

05:05.910 --> 05:07.800
It's my bathroom, remember?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.660
Manny, there's no pimple there.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.730
It's the underground kind.
I can feel my heartbeat in it.

05:11.740 --> 05:15.570
I retired. I needed a little project.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.510
So I decided to redo our master bathroom.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.580
Yeah, if only someone had told you

05:20.620 --> 05:22.880
that it was going to be
harder and longer

05:22.880 --> 05:24.980
than it looked on Youtube.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.860
Oh, wait!

05:26.900 --> 05:28.890
If you just followed
the simple bathroom schedule

05:28.890 --> 05:31.150
I posted in two places
in english and spanish...

05:31.160 --> 05:32.330
Yes, who does that?

05:32.370 --> 05:34.500
Who puts a schedule up for their family?

05:34.540 --> 05:36.000
Uh, don't go in there.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.900
I need to get my vanishing cream.
I can't find it.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.040
Must've worked.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.840
So funny, I forgot to --

05:43.940 --> 05:46.010
What happened to the shower?!

05:46.050 --> 05:47.380
It was finished!

05:47.420 --> 05:49.610
I started over.
I wasn't loving the grout.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.610
This is gonna take
at least one more week.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.910
Don't upset yourself.

05:52.910 --> 05:55.780
No, you are upsetting myself!

05:55.780 --> 05:57.280
And you're gonna go
and sleep on the couch.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.750
Are you serious?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.050
Fine.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.190
What are you doing?

06:02.190 --> 06:03.420
That's fresh tar in there.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.230
You really want to smell
that all night long?

06:05.230 --> 06:07.430
I get to make one decision
about this bathroom.

06:07.430 --> 06:09.430
The door stays open!

06:09.430 --> 06:10.730
Fine.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.560
Um, in all the bathroom confusion,

06:12.570 --> 06:14.070
instead of my multivitamin,

06:14.070 --> 06:16.100
I may have taken a birth-control pill.

06:16.150 --> 06:17.430
I think you'll be fine.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.410
And anyways, for sure
I won't be needing one tonight!

06:20.850 --> 06:22.010
It may be the pill,

06:22.010 --> 06:23.970
But I'm feeling
a little attacked right now.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.300
_

06:30.850 --> 06:32.380
Mm.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.960
Did you drink that while
it was still on fire?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.820
It's an old habit.

06:35.870 --> 06:37.220
It's how I used to eat my marshmallows.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.530
I love this guy.

06:38.530 --> 06:40.630
And you're so pretty.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.330
It's really good meeting you two.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.860
Haley, I'll give you 20 bucks
to make out with Bianca.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.360
20 bucks?

06:47.370 --> 06:49.240
So, Bianca's a smoker. Didn't love that.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.640
Or the wandering hands.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.350
But it's all a part of
the wild Haley experience.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.640
Aaaaaaah!

06:56.650 --> 06:57.640
Yeah!

06:57.650 --> 06:59.680
Ohhhh, god!

06:59.720 --> 07:01.380
Ohhhhh, no!

07:01.380 --> 07:03.210
Oh!

07:04.820 --> 07:07.320
12 seconds! Not bad!

07:07.360 --> 07:08.720
And it was so fun.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.550
That's why I was screaming.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.600
Wow, what a night, huh?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.190
Sucks it's so late.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.330
Not where we're going.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.530
I know that look -- Vegas!

07:17.530 --> 07:19.230
Come on! You in?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.500
Turtle-y!

07:20.540 --> 07:22.360
I love this idea.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.700
Me too! I was scared we were done.

07:24.710 --> 07:25.770
Let's go.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.040
Oh!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.200
Oh! Oh! That's some tender meats.

07:29.210 --> 07:30.940
Ow. Aah.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.120
I can't sleep when I'm angry.
Never could.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.260
And there's something very
wrong with people who can.

07:46.860 --> 07:49.420
What are you doing sending
e-mails this time of night?

07:50.300 --> 07:52.770
Really?

07:52.770 --> 07:54.100
You want some company?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.900
Gloria's just adjusting
to me being around more.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.270
We're on top of each other --
and not in a good way.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.640
Oh, fun. I was hoping
your sex life would come up.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.810
Look, dad, remodels are tense.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.610
Half the divorces I do
start with a remodel.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.720
Or an underwear model.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.950
Can I get you anything?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.110
You know what a reuben is? Yes.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.410
No, you don't.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.920
This is a reuben.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.920
You grill the bread and
the corned beef separately.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.050
Now, I said "corned beef".

08:17.060 --> 08:18.590
There's no vodka in a martini.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.120
There's no pastrami in a reuben.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.260
You put 'em together.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.730
Then you have kraut, swiss, russian.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.630
Axis, neutral, ally.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.760
That's how you remember.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.270
Got it. Roderigo! Number siete!

08:29.270 --> 08:30.500
What's with people today?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.640
Yeah, it's totally people.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.169
Look, dad, you get so worked up.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.350
You should try doing
this thing that I'm doing

08:36.390 --> 08:38.510
Where I just decide
not to let things bother me.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.840
Really? Yep.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.419
That's why you're here alone
in the middle of the night?

08:41.460 --> 08:43.950
It's just a little hard to get
work done at my house right now.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.580
So, once a year, some sort of
pollen is released into the air,

08:46.590 --> 08:49.590
and for two weeks, Cam has
allergy-induced sleep apnea

08:49.590 --> 08:51.850
and has to use an apparatus
in order to help him breathe.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.590
Is it hideous?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.700
Is what hideous?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.870
I barely even noticed it.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.130
What's challenging is,
Pam has the same condition.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.840
I thought that maybe I could focus

09:07.840 --> 09:10.270
if I could get those
contraptions in sync.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.520
Why did you plug it back in?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.220
Charming.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.180
No, unlike you, I didn't engage,
and I avoided a fight.

09:21.190 --> 09:22.950
So all is well on my side of the street.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.660
Mitchell, there's a pile
of little orange hairs

09:25.660 --> 09:27.020
On your keyboard.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.230
You're picking your eyebrows again.

09:28.230 --> 09:30.060
Like you did when I put
you in little league.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.500
Okay, I am a little stressed.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.300
But it's just 'cause I'm --
I'm buried under work.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.230
And Cam's sister is the
worst influence on Lily.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.310
But I-I can't yell at her
because she's a sopping mess.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.180
So, you know,
who am I supposed to yell at?

09:41.220 --> 09:43.050
My husband, who needs
a machine to breathe?

09:43.090 --> 09:45.180
Well, you better find yourself an outlet.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.740
That's why I have scotch
and golf and cigars.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.640
Otherwise, I'd be a raging jackass.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.880
We're out of rye. Then bake some!

09:51.890 --> 09:53.860
Can you please not yell at the
woman who's bringing us our food?

09:53.900 --> 09:55.090
I -- our food -- stop that.
That's gross!

09:55.090 --> 09:57.090
It's like a fox ran across the table.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.150
We're out of here.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.350
No, I have work to do.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.260
No, you got to blow off some steam.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.530
O-okay, this sounds
a lot like little league.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.560
We better not be going
to a batting cage.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.570
You do not want to put a bat
in my hands right now.

10:07.570 --> 10:08.670
Like you could hit me.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.370
Let's go.

10:10.370 --> 10:11.570
Ba-ba-ba!

10:11.570 --> 10:13.870
Out of that trance!
We're going to France!

10:13.880 --> 10:16.380
I can yawn. It's 2:30 in the morning.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.880
Mais non, mademoiselle!
It's 11:30 in the morning.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.910
Mm.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.180
Thanks for doing these.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.280
Yeah.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.110
Did I mention that -- yes, you did --

10:24.120 --> 10:26.220
that if you wear your
sweatpants low enough,

10:26.220 --> 10:28.680
tonight, I will see London,
I will see France,

10:28.690 --> 10:31.250
and then, yes,
I will see your underpants.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.250
Phil!

10:32.260 --> 10:33.690
You're asleep!

10:33.700 --> 10:35.100
Oh, no, no, no!

10:35.100 --> 10:36.230
It's fine. We can take a nap.

10:36.230 --> 10:38.190
Europeans are always napping.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.060
Actually, that's the
worst thing you can do.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.370
She's right, Claire. Get up.

10:41.370 --> 10:42.460
Why are you still awake?

10:42.470 --> 10:44.200
I'm too excited to sleep.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.710
I'm studying big bang nucleosynthesis --

10:45.710 --> 10:47.240
Well, more specifically

10:47.280 --> 10:49.200
the total baryonic matter
in the universe.

10:49.210 --> 10:49.940
Let's go back.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.450
Dark matter and dark energy

10:51.450 --> 10:53.980
make up 95% of all
of the matter in the --

10:54.020 --> 10:55.580
No! Go away! Stop!

10:55.580 --> 10:57.080
We needed help.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.790
And no surprise, first entry
on howtostayawake.net --

10:59.790 --> 11:00.890
Coffee.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.790
This did it. This is all we needed.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.550
You want to rub my feet?
If you rub mine.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.560
Phil!

11:06.600 --> 11:08.460
The feet! Why'd we do the feet?!

11:09.470 --> 11:11.970
Second tip -- stay active.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.330
You're asleep!

11:17.340 --> 11:19.510
Finally, we found something that worked.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.150
For me.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.080
No! What the hell?!

11:26.180 --> 11:28.410
Aah! Oh, my nana!

11:31.520 --> 11:33.480
Hey.

11:33.490 --> 11:35.190
What do you say we take a walk
and get something to eat?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.750
It's french lunchtime.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.330
Sure. It's worth a shot.

11:38.370 --> 11:39.900
Got to do something first.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
Aah! Why?!

11:43.500 --> 11:44.870
Why would you do that?!

11:46.700 --> 11:48.360
All I'm saying is,

11:48.370 --> 11:50.530
if you're lucky enough
to get this boy Ryan you like,

11:50.540 --> 11:52.140
you hold on with both hands.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.000
'Cause once he's gone, you're nothing.

11:54.010 --> 11:55.540
Okay, you don't really mean that.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.870
I don't know what I mean.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.210
I'm just a woman
running her fool mouth off.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.040
Okay, not exactly the
message of empowerment

12:01.050 --> 12:03.720
we'd like to impart to
our 21st-century daughter.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.190
What's a Demerol shooter?

12:05.230 --> 12:07.660
Okay, you know what?
Let's keep our voices down.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.390
We don't want anyone woken up
and proven correct.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.220
Give me that.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.860
One more drag! No. Stop.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.360
What's the worst it's gonna do? Kill me?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.020
Stop...it!

12:15.030 --> 12:15.960
Hey, I rolled that!

12:17.530 --> 12:20.360
Mama!

12:20.370 --> 12:21.370
Mama!

12:21.370 --> 12:22.660
What?!

12:22.670 --> 12:24.370
Ay. Sorry, sorry. It's you, papi.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.530
What's wrong?

12:25.540 --> 12:26.870
Can you please deal with Joe?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.040
And also get a therapist?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.170
Mama!

12:29.180 --> 12:31.150
Mama! But...

12:31.190 --> 12:32.880
That is not coming from his bedroom.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.180
Mama!

12:34.180 --> 12:35.740
Oh, no!

12:39.090 --> 12:41.790
I wanted a glass of water,
and I got stuck.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.800
_

12:46.730 --> 12:47.760
Damn it!

12:47.800 --> 12:50.260
Why didn't I close that door
so you didn't get stuck

12:50.270 --> 12:52.270
like Manny's gerbil in the glue trap?!

12:52.270 --> 12:53.900
But you said he ran away.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.600
Yes, most of him did.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.000
Take off your slippers.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.180
Oh, yeah, good idea. Don't want
anything bad to happen to them.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.370
Okay.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.540
Wait! What are you doing?!

13:02.590 --> 13:04.070
Are you crazy?!
They're florentine leather!

13:04.080 --> 13:06.050
Ay, Manny, that's what we just told you.

13:06.090 --> 13:07.380
We got them in Chinatown.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.940
Okay, little Joe.

13:08.950 --> 13:12.250
Let's get you out of there.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.280
Okay, come on!

13:13.290 --> 13:14.760
Okay. Ay.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.290
Now we're gonna burn these pajamas

13:16.290 --> 13:18.120
With the towel and the slippers.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.190
Burn them?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.960
It's in my hair, too.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.720
Okay. I will cut it.

13:23.730 --> 13:27.460
Go. Grab some scissors
and run them back to mama.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.570
I'll get the scissors, Joe!

13:30.110 --> 13:32.110
I didn't even want him, and I'm
the only one keeping him alive.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.880
Okay, I just have to smooth this out

13:34.920 --> 13:36.950
So that Jay doesn't notice anything.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.050
You're really going through a lot
of trouble to hide this from him.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.750
You just don't understand.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.280
This is the first time in a fight

13:42.320 --> 13:45.910
That I was 100% right
and Jay was 100% wrong.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.820
That never happens.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.250
And being right is so important?

13:49.260 --> 13:50.830
Get married and then get back to me.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.130
Ay, no! This is stuck! Come help me!

13:56.100 --> 13:57.170
Push!

14:02.270 --> 14:04.400
Oh, no! My birthday Rolex!

14:04.410 --> 14:06.010
Ay, Manny.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.680
We'll take the check, please.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.650
No!

14:11.690 --> 14:12.610
Oh.

14:12.660 --> 14:13.910
Thank you so much.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.350
I want to go to sleep so bad, Phil.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.910
Oh.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.160
Maybe this will keep you awake.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.920
Our house cannot be this far.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.290
We've been walking for...

14:25.330 --> 14:27.690
We've passed this mattress already.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.930
Claire.

14:28.930 --> 14:29.920
It's fate.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.430
God wants me to sleep.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.360
Fight it! Fight it, Claire!

14:33.370 --> 14:34.670
Let me go!

14:34.670 --> 14:36.440
No! No! We're so close!

14:36.480 --> 14:38.210
I can't let you quit!

14:38.250 --> 14:41.470
Oh, God. I'm not gonna go to
sleep on some filthy mattress.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.310
Okay.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.270
For long.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.650
No. No!

14:44.690 --> 14:46.010
No, no. I'm sorry.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.880
I'm so tired from work already.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.380
I won't be any fun in Paris.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.710
You should go.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.390
Meet someone. I don't care.

14:52.430 --> 14:54.260
I just can't do it. I'm sorry.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.150
You know what?

14:58.160 --> 14:59.300
Let's not.

15:00.790 --> 15:03.060
I shouldn't have pushed you.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.160
I know I said all that stuff
about not wanting to get old,

15:05.170 --> 15:07.000
but...

15:07.000 --> 15:09.500
I think I really wanted
to go because I miss you.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.000
Ohhhh.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.640
Because I've been working so much?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.800
Yeah, which is great.
I-I really want that for you.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.540
I-I think I...

15:17.550 --> 15:18.840
I just wanted a little adventure.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.380
But you know what?

15:20.380 --> 15:22.180
We've had so much fun tonight.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.410
When was the last time

15:23.420 --> 15:25.820
I got to stay up until 5:00
in the morning with you?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.150
Give me that hand.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.420
What for?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.490
Oh! That's to wake me up.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.360
Wow. And that is for ever forgetting

15:34.360 --> 15:36.690
that you are the best husband.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.670
Mmmmm. Mmmm.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.070
Oh. What's that for?

15:40.070 --> 15:41.570
For whatever's crawling all over me!

15:41.570 --> 15:43.840
Oh, no! They're on me, too!

15:45.110 --> 15:47.040
$40 for the hour. Songs are in the book.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.200
Anyone want a cocktail?

15:48.210 --> 15:49.910
You know how to make a Manhattan? Yes.

15:49.910 --> 15:51.210
No, you don't. The only Manhattan --

15:51.210 --> 15:52.040
He's got it, dad.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.680
Thank you. Thanks.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.340
So, a karaoke bar, huh?

15:56.850 --> 15:58.250
You know, it's a little
offensive that you think

15:58.250 --> 15:59.880
singing a pop song
is gonna solve my problems.

15:59.890 --> 16:00.960
How gay do you think I am?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.260
Mitchell!

16:02.260 --> 16:03.560
Madonna!

16:03.560 --> 16:05.930
Oh! Yeah. Okay.

16:05.970 --> 16:07.030
Well, come on!

16:07.030 --> 16:09.760
You used to dance and sing
Madonna in the living room.

16:09.810 --> 16:10.890
Fixed you right up.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.230
Ah, I'm not surprised.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.200
You think I haven't changed
at all in 25 years.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.760
If you were surprised,
I wouldn't know it,

16:15.770 --> 16:16.960
since you've plucked out
all your eyebrows.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.910
Madonna, Mitchell.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.640
News flash -- I am not singing.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.240
News flash -- yes, you are!

16:23.240 --> 16:24.310
Ooh. You know what, dad?

16:24.350 --> 16:26.410
You have been really bossy tonight.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.280
With me, with that waitress.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.880
I-I bet that's why you and
Gloria are having problems.

16:30.890 --> 16:31.980
Yeah.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.450
You miss bossing people around at work,

16:33.500 --> 16:34.620
so now you're doing it at home.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.550
If I admitted there was
some truth in that,

16:36.560 --> 16:38.130
could you just give in?

16:38.170 --> 16:39.560
You've been grinding around
like Lola Falana.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.390
I don't know why this
is so important to you.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.600
Can you just let me help you?!

16:43.600 --> 16:45.770
Okay, I'm doing this,

16:45.810 --> 16:48.400
but only because you need it so much.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.500
Come on, girls!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.000
Do you believe in love?

16:52.010 --> 16:54.140
'Cause I got something to say about it.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.900
And it goes something like this.

16:56.910 --> 17:00.740
# don't go for second best, baby #

17:00.750 --> 17:02.620
# put your love to the test #

17:02.660 --> 17:04.190
# you know, you know... #

17:04.230 --> 17:05.520
Watching Mitchell,
I did feel kind of good

17:05.520 --> 17:07.079
about fixing his problem.

17:07.089 --> 17:10.089
Now, being retired, you don't
always feel useful anymore.

17:10.089 --> 17:12.589
It's probably why I keep
tearing up that bathroom.

17:12.589 --> 17:16.760
I guess it wouldn't be the worst
thing to admit to Gloria.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.430
Eh, it'll probably blow over.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.290
# express yourself #

17:20.300 --> 17:21.700
Damn it.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.609
# express yourself #

17:24.650 --> 17:28.339
# hey, hey, hey, hey #

17:28.380 --> 17:30.370
I knew you'd be up, tossing and turning.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.710
Yes, yes.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.440
Why are you calling from the couch?

17:33.450 --> 17:34.550
Not home. Long story.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.780
Look, let me get this out.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.980
I have been going crazy
with the bathroom,

17:37.990 --> 17:40.490
but it's not really about the bathroom.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.960
It's about me not being
sure who I am anymore.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.460
You were 100% right.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.860
I love to hear that, but --

17:45.860 --> 17:47.020
No, you were.

17:47.030 --> 17:49.330
Okay. No rush getting home.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.630
We're fine here.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.630
Please, please, please, please,
please, please! Come on, black!

17:53.630 --> 17:54.900
18 red.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.030
18 red.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.370
So close.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.700
Gambling is the best!

17:58.710 --> 18:00.140
Yeah.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.640
You hand your hard-earned
money to strangers

18:01.640 --> 18:02.200
and pray it comes back.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.850
I know I've had a lot to drink,

18:05.890 --> 18:07.680
but that is not Bianca anymore, is it?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.310
Nope.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.550
I don't want to believe
Clint sold her...

18:11.590 --> 18:13.380
You guys want to get really crazy?

18:13.390 --> 18:14.760
People know where I am.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.060
All-in on one number.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.760
Okay, I guess that's no scarier

18:18.760 --> 18:20.550
than when that glow-stick
broke in my mouth.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.660
Do it.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.170
Andy, that's, like, a month's rent.

18:25.210 --> 18:26.530
Hey, you got to go big or --

18:26.580 --> 18:27.900
Wait -- the black ones aren't $1s?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.100
Really? Okay, could I just --

18:29.100 --> 18:30.200
Sorry, sir. The ball's rolling.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.530
Oh, my gosh.

18:31.540 --> 18:32.670
Andy, what is happening with you?

18:32.710 --> 18:34.200
Why are you doing this?

18:34.210 --> 18:35.840
What are you talking about?
I thought you loved wild Andy.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.570
No, no.

18:36.580 --> 18:37.910
I love normal Andy,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.710
Tomato-soup-and-grilled-cheese Andy.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.280
Still-in-bed-by-11:00 Andy.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.610
Uses-the-word-"tummy" Andy.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.290
Really? Because I've been
doing this whole thing

18:44.330 --> 18:45.520
because I was afraid
you'd get bored and dump me

18:45.520 --> 18:47.010
if I couldn't keep up.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.950
I know you can't keep up.
But I'd rather slow down.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.560
I like the me I am when I'm with you.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.030
Well, I wish you would have
told me that about a minute ago.

18:54.070 --> 18:55.230
Aah! I can't watch!

18:55.230 --> 18:57.070
The stress is murder on my tummy.

18:59.570 --> 19:00.810
Aunt Pam's leaving.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.070
Pameron Jessica Tucker,
where do you think you're going?

19:05.110 --> 19:07.370
Home -- to get down on my knees
and beg bo to come back.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.610
I'm just gonna lie
and tell him I'm pregnant.

19:09.610 --> 19:12.870
No, that is not how mature
people handle their problems.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.280
I will fight you.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.940
You are not going to
crawl back to that man.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.280
You don't have a choice.
You know I can take you.

19:19.290 --> 19:21.130
Oh, yeah, right.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.380
Ooh!

19:23.390 --> 19:25.220
Pameron -- no! Ow! Oh!

19:25.230 --> 19:27.130
Okay, you know what?

19:27.130 --> 19:29.100
You are going to regret that!

19:29.140 --> 19:30.430
Ungh!

19:30.430 --> 19:33.290
Oh, now you poked the bear!

19:33.300 --> 19:34.500
Well, come on, mama bear!

19:34.500 --> 19:35.630
I'm coming!

19:38.970 --> 19:40.730
It's all my fault anyway!

19:40.740 --> 19:42.840
I pushed him away! Aah! Oh!

19:42.840 --> 19:45.340
Because I never listened!

19:46.850 --> 19:48.750
You really want Lily
to think women are weak?!

19:48.750 --> 19:51.090
Get off my daddy!

19:51.130 --> 19:54.020
You're acting this crazy
all over a boy?!

19:54.020 --> 19:55.950
Oh, Lily, I'm so happy
to hear you say that!

19:55.960 --> 19:57.700
Now, pull aunt Pameron's bra strap!

19:59.260 --> 20:01.160
Oh. Okay. So we moved the couch.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.620
Where were you?

20:03.630 --> 20:05.590
I, uh, I had some work to do.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.100
Me too. Get my man back.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.330
Okay. Okay. All right.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.840
As much as I'd love to leave this alone,

20:11.840 --> 20:13.110
I learned something tonight

20:13.150 --> 20:14.880
That I feel like I-I
need to share with you.

20:15.980 --> 20:19.280
You deserve the best in life.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.980
So if the time isn't right,
then...move on.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.780
Second best, it's...

20:24.790 --> 20:25.890
It's never enough.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.060
You'll do much better,
baby, on your own.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.190
Baby.

20:30.190 --> 20:31.350
On your own.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.690
Ohhh.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.690
My God.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.600
You're right.

20:38.130 --> 20:39.490
Yeah.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.060
Don't go for second best.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.070
Put your love --

20:42.070 --> 20:43.500
It's okay. I fixed her.

20:43.550 --> 20:44.900
Madonna fixed her.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.300
_

20:52.980 --> 20:54.480
Don't worry. We've got this.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.480
Take all the time you need.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.980
I'm only finishing a 12-hour shift.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.220
Do you got a nickel
or a dime or anything?

21:00.220 --> 21:01.210
I don't.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.050
Sorry, but...

21:03.060 --> 21:04.730
You're gonna have to make change.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.360
What?!

21:09.360 --> 21:11.330
My mom and dad are going to Paris.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.830
Okay, children informed,
passports secured,

21:14.840 --> 21:16.200
luggage packed.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.100
Oh. What am I forgetting?

21:19.110 --> 21:20.410
Oh, yeah.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.570
Au revoir, Alex!

21:25.580 --> 21:27.780
Next stop -- Paradise City!

21:27.780 --> 21:29.640
Guns'n'roses.
