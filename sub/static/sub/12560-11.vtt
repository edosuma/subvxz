00:00.230 --> 00:02.160
previously on royal pains...

00:02.160 --> 00:03.580
mr.Gardner is stable.

00:03.580 --> 00:06.900
So how about today we save twofor the price of one?

00:06.900 --> 00:10.930
You let a billionairehospital trustee die on your day off.

00:10.930 --> 00:12.620
The gardner family managedto pull a few strings

00:12.620 --> 00:15.900
and have me blackballedat every level-one trauma centerin new york.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.780
Stay in my guest cottageand be my concierge doctor.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.420
You have a sharkin your basement.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.950
This animalwas meant for research.

00:21.950 --> 00:24.730
Are there any humanmedical implications to your research?

00:24.730 --> 00:28.270
Your cpkis slightly elevated,but that's no real causefor concern.

00:28.270 --> 00:32.299
Boris alters his vaguelymedical research plans when he getshis blood results,

00:32.299 --> 00:34.970
then the blood mysteriouslyvanishes from the lab.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.040
Is boris sick?

00:36.040 --> 00:40.280
I know you thinkyou've come to save my life,but I may be saving yours.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.470
Save my life?

00:49.470 --> 00:51.030
I'm not the onewho's sick,boris.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.640
Tell me what's going on.

00:53.860 --> 00:56.780
It's come to my attentionthat the gardners intend

00:56.780 --> 01:00.020
to pressurethe state licensing board to revoke your credentials.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.870
They're aftermy license now?

01:01.870 --> 01:03.930
It's not enoughto blackball me from new york city's hospitals,

01:03.930 --> 01:06.100
take all my money,and run me out of town?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.000
How do you know?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.820
Your name came upin my business here.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.410
What business?

01:11.410 --> 01:16.620
A business that just happenedto come up after you overreactto a moderate cpk spike

01:16.620 --> 01:19.440
and then have your bloodremoved from the lab?

01:19.440 --> 01:22.270
I have obligations all over the world,hank.

01:22.270 --> 01:25.190
You have an illnessand I need to know what it is to be your doctor.

01:25.190 --> 01:27.700
You're an E.R.Doctor,hank,not a diagnostician.

01:27.700 --> 01:28.850
We all diagnose.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.020
Not if youdon't have a license.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.680
The gardnersare not getting my license.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.350
There was no negligence.

01:34.350 --> 01:35.580
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:35.580 --> 01:38.560
Well,that won'tmatter much,will it,if they curry favorwith the board.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.840
Do not underestimatethese people,hank.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.960
Trust me.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.530
I'm good.I'm fine.I didn't get my requisite nine hours,but I'll survive.

01:51.530 --> 01:55.670
So how's boris'new york pad?I'm picturing,like,a cramped fourth-floor walk up?

01:55.670 --> 01:57.930
Yeah,it's a few floorshigher than that.

01:57.930 --> 01:58.930
That's so funny.

01:58.930 --> 02:03.030
In my mind,I'm picturing you in,like,a giant airship being waitedon hand and foot and eating,

02:03.030 --> 02:05.430
like,a lavish breakfast served on fine china.

02:05.430 --> 02:09.039
You know what,evan?Don't be ridiculous.

02:09.039 --> 02:12.230
Anyway,uh,so I've seen boris.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.890
Really?How is the old boy?

02:13.890 --> 02:15.670
Did he bring hispet shark with him?

02:15.670 --> 02:19.030
Oh,let me guess.You can't talk about it'cause of doctor-patient confi-da-da-blah-blah-blah.

02:19.030 --> 02:21.540
You're honestly becomingno fun to talk to.You realize that?

02:21.540 --> 02:24.650
All right,find my lawyer'sphone number,will you?I can't find it in my phone.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.760
I'm sure his business cardis lying around there somewhere.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.360
Henry,I thought youwent back to new york to do things with boris you'renot allowed to tell me about.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.560
You never mentionedanything about laws,lawyers,and lawsuits.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.290
It's nothing.I just want to check inwith him while I'm in town.

02:35.290 --> 02:36.960
All right,I'll text it to you.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.590
Thank you.Are you sure you and divyacan cover today?

02:39.590 --> 02:40.860
Oh,my god.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.570
I still can't believe you'renot gonna be here for this.

02:42.570 --> 02:44.120
This is a giant fish,hank.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.950
Look,this is biggerthan boris' giant fish.

02:45.950 --> 02:48.740
This is the loch ness monsterof fishes.

02:48.740 --> 02:49.910
Yeah,I'm all broken up.

02:49.910 --> 02:51.280
Yeah,you will be once youfind out who this is.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.920
This is the biggest,wealthiest,most exclusive clientwe've ever had by far.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.130
Really?Okay,I'll bite.Who is it?

02:58.130 --> 03:00.250
I have no idea.

03:00.250 --> 03:04.390
Whoever he or she is,they are so famous that we can't even find outtill we get there.

03:04.390 --> 03:05.810
How awesome is that?

03:05.810 --> 03:08.570
And they've already cut mea cashier's check that literally made me tear upa little bit.

03:08.570 --> 03:11.270
Control yourself.Good-bye,ev.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.160
So this mystery boss of yoursmust be into sailing.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.270
There she is.

03:19.270 --> 03:20.470
This is the boat?

03:20.470 --> 03:21.640
No,it's not.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.170
Well,this is what you calla "water toy"?

03:24.170 --> 03:26.210
Oh,man,you should seethe mother ship.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.740
It's gigantic.It's like the enterprise at sea.

03:28.740 --> 03:30.220
Makes this thinglook like-

03:30.220 --> 03:32.090
like something you playwith in the bathtub.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.080
Like something you play within the bathtub.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.640
Well,the scaleis about right,so.

03:38.860 --> 03:40.120
I like this guy.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.420
Hey,this guy likes you.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.390
This is definitely a boil that needs to be lanced.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.790
And I have what I needto take care of it.

03:46.790 --> 03:50.490
Great.Just sign thisnon-disclosure agreement and we'll head out.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.800
I don't need to signany additional documents.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.120
Uh,you don't knowmy boss.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.280
I hardly know him.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.500
Well,we should getto know him.Right,divya?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.720
Oh,"him."So it's a guy.Interesting.So that narrows it down.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.310
I'm not signing anythinguntil I speak with the patient.

04:05.310 --> 04:06.840
And you will.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.100
He's on the main boat.I have to take you out there.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.410
The mother ship?So we see the mother ship?

04:11.410 --> 04:12.430
Oh,bless you.

04:12.430 --> 04:13.790
Absolutely not.

04:13.790 --> 04:17.290
But absolutely not.Yes,we can't sign anythinguntil we discuss it first.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.190
So just give us one second.

Like,are youthe kind of person that just shakes your presents

04:43.800 --> 04:45.200
to see what's in them before you open them?

04:45.200 --> 04:48.170
Evan,this isn'tyour birthday gift.

04:48.170 --> 04:49.700
This is business.

04:49.700 --> 04:52.750
Well,actually,if you'd seen the check,you'd know it'sa little bit of both,

04:52.750 --> 04:56.610
and hankmed doesnot discriminate just because a clientis a little bit secretive.

04:56.610 --> 04:59.960
Ask boris.Yeah.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.970
By the way,bryan,where did youget those top-siders?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.200

Divya,don't be ru-that was a perfectlygood beer.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.180
I don't drink on the job.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.630
And neither do you.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.440
You're not--divya,do not confiscate my beverage.

Di-bryan,what the hellis this?

05:24.410 --> 05:26.830
Well,this isthe water toy,actually.Believe it or not.

05:26.830 --> 05:30.870
Boss told meto tell you that he's sorry andthat he can't wait to see you.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.480
And then he saidsome other stuff that I'm not gonna repeat.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.510
But,trust me,it was pretty funny.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.710
Is she famous?She looks familiar.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.670
Yeah,I can't believe hesent the damn dinghy.He knows I hate it.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.240
Why didn't he sendthe chopper?

05:43.240 --> 05:44.110
Boat's quieter.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.650
Not when I'm throughyelling at him.He knows I get seasick.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.990
Well,you actually don't haveto worry about getting seasick,because we're hankmed.

05:49.990 --> 05:53.340

You're the--you're the "what-stress"?

06:14.520 --> 06:18.270

On the contrary,I'm quite pleasedyou've agreed to stay.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.020
I'd like to run some tests.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.250
That type of muscle contraction is possible with myotonic muscular dystrophy.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.170
I've been around that particular road,hank.

07:21.170 --> 07:24.650
And you've probably talked to motor-neuron specialists,parkinson's,A.L.S.

07:24.650 --> 07:27.170
Spoken with every specialist in the free world

07:27.170 --> 07:29.920
and some in parts of the world that aren't so free.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.070
And they can't tell you what it is?

07:32.070 --> 07:32.680
No.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.940
- Which is why we have to run some-
- no,my hand is feeling better,thank you.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.820
Boris,we have to talk about what's going on with you.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.040
Yes,but not now.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.120
That's an extensive conversation.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.770
Let's talk about your situation.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.520
You've structured a plan,have you?

07:45.520 --> 07:47.330
I called my lawyer.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.390
I made a few calls too.I think I can help.

07:49.390 --> 07:50.670
How?

07:50.670 --> 07:53.250
Perhaps best if you don't know.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.440
No,thank you.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.290
Look,I'll just have my lawyer set up a face to face with the gardner family.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.460
Enough time has passed.I'll just-I'll just explain it to them.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.070
Explain?

08:03.070 --> 08:06.700
Explain.Interesting concept.

08:20.450 --> 08:23.310
You should sit down if you'refeeling nauseated.

08:23.310 --> 08:28.830
Oh,I appreciateyour medical advice,but I find that a little bitof dom does the trick.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.530
It doesn'T.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.850
You should have some water.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.640
We're surrounded by water.I'm sick of it.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.770
Why couldn't I have meta nice rich married guy with a fleet of jets?

08:39.770 --> 08:43.020
Well,nobody's perfect.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.780
At this stage in my life,I can't exactly affordto be choosy.

08:45.780 --> 08:48.340
Wait,you can't be morethan what,30?

08:48.340 --> 08:50.800
Most of them are lookingfor 20 year olds on the side.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.080
Ever consider datinga single person?

08:53.080 --> 08:56.020
Who's gonna pay for my loft?

08:56.020 --> 08:58.110
This boat's insane.It's got everything.

08:58.110 --> 08:59.700
Yeah.

08:59.700 --> 09:05.020
You know,all I really need isjust a couple sails and the big blue sea.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.670
You know,grill a couple of fish.

09:07.670 --> 09:09.800
Just look at the stars.Keep it simple.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.330
Keep it simpleon a 100-foot yacht?

09:12.330 --> 09:16.250
Whoa,it's like walden pond onlywith a luxury sailboat.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.780
I could losethe luxury part.

09:17.780 --> 09:20.270
Whoa,hey,bite your tongue,man.

09:20.270 --> 09:21.830
You tell him,skinny.

09:21.830 --> 09:25.720
You know,you could,you know,sail a smaller boat if you really wanted to.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.810
But he pays a hell of a lotbetter,doesn't he?

09:27.810 --> 09:29.860
Not that much better.Trust me.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.860
Okay,who is thisbenefactor of yours?

09:32.860 --> 09:34.430
It can't hurt to tell us now.

09:34.430 --> 09:37.630
She reads the last page ofmystery novels first as well.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.870
Well,he is a manof mystery.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.840
You know all those insanelyfamous people who lost billions investing

09:43.840 --> 09:46.420
with a guy who stole it and disappeared?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.250
Gary pastotnik?

09:49.250 --> 09:51.300
I mean,half the hamptonswant his head on a platter.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.020
Yeah,the richest,most powerful half.

09:53.020 --> 09:57.080
That guy single-handedly broughtthe word "scoundrel" back into everyday use.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.340
That's my gary.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.640
Wait.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.720
Gary pastotnik?

10:02.720 --> 10:05.750
That guy is like satan,only more evil.

10:05.750 --> 10:09.330
Aside from my therapist,you're the first peopleI've told.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.920
He's the client?

10:10.920 --> 10:13.850
Well,hankmed is treatinga fugitive.

10:13.850 --> 10:16.220
Well,that's just great.That's great.

10:16.220 --> 10:17.560
Happy now?

10:17.560 --> 10:19.420
I don't understand.The money's the same.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.010
Well,actually,no,it's not the same.His money's stolen.

10:22.010 --> 10:25.420
Okay,at the ratesyou're charging,so is yours.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.420
We all know what we are.Nothing left to dobut name the price.

10:28.420 --> 10:33.480
This is why I liketo read the last page first.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.390
Here we are.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.640
*********

11:04.290 --> 11:06.530
- Good morning.
- Good morning,sir.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.560
Good morning,alba.Will you join us?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.830
- Of course.
- I take it youcome here often.

11:14.830 --> 11:19.010
I'm required to.I own it.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.770
Watch yourself,hank.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.290
Hey,miss divorce papers.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.050
Are you avoiding me?

12:07.050 --> 12:09.070
How narcissistic are you?

12:09.070 --> 12:12.070
I was tryingto get some work done.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.660
Did you tell the process server to fake stomach pains?

12:14.660 --> 12:16.540
'Cause that was so good.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.880
Never saw it coming.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.280
Please just sign them.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.670
Okay.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.640
Really?Every page?

12:26.640 --> 12:30.520
If it'll make you happy,yeah.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.740
What's the catch?

12:36.740 --> 12:37.900
Ten minutes of your time.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.730
- For what?
- A surprise.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.720
Don't make that face.You used to love my surprises.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.880
Used to.Past tense.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.170
Ten minutes of your time.I'm gonna tell youwhere and when.

12:45.170 --> 12:47.080
All you have to dois show up.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.340
And then you'll signthe papers?

12:48.340 --> 12:51.400
Every page.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.650
So this iswhere it came from?

13:00.650 --> 13:05.960
Some of these depositboxes have been here since my great-grandfatherbuilt the place.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.910
Really?

13:06.910 --> 13:10.080
He must have spenta lot of years here.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.460
He died soon after,actually.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.340
Accidental drowning,wasn't it?

13:15.580 --> 13:19.690
I've done some research on the kuester vonjugens-ratenicz clan.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.420
Oh,yes?

13:21.420 --> 13:26.190
Your father diedin an airplane crash in the andeswhen he was just 44.

13:26.190 --> 13:30.230
His father died skiingin st.Moritz at 43.

13:30.230 --> 13:33.840
That's just aboutthe age you are now.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.070
Three accidental deaths?

13:37.070 --> 13:39.380
They're lies,aren't they?

13:39.380 --> 13:41.660
This thing you have,it's genetic.

13:41.660 --> 13:45.990
And as you've so diligentlydiscovered,hank,quite fatal.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.320
You've knownyour whole life...

13:47.320 --> 13:49.490
how it would end,yes.

13:49.490 --> 13:53.990
- Medicine is evolving-
- medicine is insufficient.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.360
It doesn't have to be.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.390
As a boy,I watched my fatherget lost in the disease.

14:04.390 --> 14:08.040
He was larger than life,you know?

14:08.040 --> 14:12.400
Then suddenly his muscleswere failing him.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.270
In a year,his mind as well.

14:15.270 --> 14:18.820
He signed off a good dealof our resources to,um...

14:19.970 --> 14:22.840
unscrupulous associates.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.700
Declaration of incompetenceis a sensitive subject.

14:27.420 --> 14:29.820
I'm sorry.I'm just a little confused.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.820
You disappearfrom the hamptons.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.600
You're sick,but you won'tlet me treat you.

14:33.600 --> 14:39.220
Yet you call me hereabout my medical license and now you take meto your bank.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.710
What is going on?Why am I here?

14:40.710 --> 14:44.370
I've grown to appreciateyour integrity,hank.

14:44.370 --> 14:47.780
I want you to do for me whatno one would do for my father.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.080
Stay on with me.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.340
Monitor my condition.Manage my...

14:54.340 --> 14:56.820
challenges.

14:58.050 --> 15:02.160
I'll give you ample timeto decide,of course.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.710
Look,if I agree to do this,and I'm not saying I will,

15:06.710 --> 15:08.700
I will wantto know everything.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.430
A complete medical history.

15:10.430 --> 15:11.420
The real thing.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.130
- What are yourmeasurements,hank?
- What?Why?

15:13.130 --> 15:14.710
You're gonna need a suit.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.160
A suit?

15:16.160 --> 15:19.860
A meeting has been arrangedwith the gardners for this afternoon.

15:19.860 --> 15:23.970
You wanted to face them,now you'll have your chance.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.210
I can't believeyou got us into this.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.480
Sure you can.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.520
I've gotten us into worse.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.940
You saw those zeroson that check and lost all abilityto think.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.540
In his defense,it was a lot of zeros.

15:43.540 --> 15:47.730
Look,it wasn'tjust the money.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.810
Okay,fine,you know what?Yes,money's importantto me.

15:50.810 --> 15:54.020
It's what we use to buy foodand shelter and bling.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.400
But since we gotto the hamptons,it's been different.I've been evolving.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.760
- Into what?
- Don't blame him.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.560
Gary's made of money.He buys anything he wants.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.140
Look,no offense,buddy,but I don't think a shout outfrom the getaway driver's helping me here,so-

16:08.140 --> 16:12.200
hey,look,I did nothelp him get away.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.400
I just help him sail aroundnow that he's gotten away.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.860
Yeah,you're right.

16:18.860 --> 16:20.900
It's no different.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.880
- This is why I didn't wantto come.
- Why?

16:22.880 --> 16:27.670
Because you knewthat he was gonna be some infamous scoundrel that wasgonna tank our reputation?

16:27.670 --> 16:28.810
You just knew it?

16:28.810 --> 16:35.090
Because I knowthat the reality is always disappointing comparedto what you imagine.

16:35.090 --> 16:39.510
And at the end of the day,all that really matters to you is you.

16:39.510 --> 16:42.180
Oh,and money.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.400
You're right,divya.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.010
You're right.That champagnedid not help at all.

16:48.010 --> 16:51.050
Sit down.The fresh air will help.

16:52.890 --> 16:56.520
What the hell?I hate this freaking boat.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.240
No,no,no,don't touch that!Don't touch that!

16:59.240 --> 17:00.860
Whatever!

17:00.860 --> 17:02.830
Don't touch that!

17:06.920 --> 17:09.160
Kylie,don't touch him.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.890
You all right,man?

17:11.730 --> 17:14.490
Oh,my god.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.369
Oh,man.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.349
- Bryan,I'm so sorry.
- That looked really bad.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.450
Oh,my god!

17:22.450 --> 17:23.040
Ow,what?What is it?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.640
Nothing,no,no,it's fine.Oh,my god,you're luckyyou didn't get hurt worse,

17:25.640 --> 17:27.109
'cause that's not that bad.

17:27.109 --> 17:28.790
Kylie,call 911.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.800
They'll call the feds.Gary will kill me.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.500
Maybe we should call him.He'll take care of it.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.280
We need the coast guard.We need themto help us too.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.710
Now!

17:37.710 --> 17:39.010
What the hell'shappening to me?

17:39.010 --> 17:40.910
You're gonna be fine.Go get my bag.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.800
Oh,yeah.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.300
Okay,the fall brokeyour ribs.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.620
A segment of your chestdetached from the rest of your chest wall.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.040
It's called a flail chest.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.510
That sucks.

17:49.510 --> 17:51.630
It could be worse though,right?

17:51.630 --> 17:53.950
Why is he breathingbackwards?Backwards?I'm breathing backwards?

17:53.950 --> 17:55.210
Paradoxically.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.590
He's breathing ironically,what?

17:56.590 --> 18:00.650
The flail segmentof your chest is movingin the opposite direction of the rest of your chest.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.430
It's called paradoxicalbreathing.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.100
I want to breathe forwards.Make me breathe forwards.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.340
We're gonna do everythingwe can,okay?

18:06.340 --> 18:07.270
You'll be just fine.

18:07.270 --> 18:08.600
His chest,it's going in and out.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.960
Stop.Stop,all right?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.830
He needs mechanicalventilation.Maybe surgery.

18:13.830 --> 18:16.210
- I mean,thingsthat we can't do-
- we can't do.

18:16.210 --> 18:17.160
That means he's gonna die.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.690
That means that we're-I can't die.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.330
Divya,I can't die.I've never been in love.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.350
I haven't beenon the apprentice yet.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.690
Stop it!Evan,you're freaking out.

18:24.690 --> 18:26.090
I know.What am I supposed to do?

18:26.090 --> 18:27.050
We're in the middleof the ocean.

18:27.050 --> 18:30.400
The captain's chestis a paradox and you just saidwe can't do anything.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.640
- What am I supposed--
- listen.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.170
I said we can'tdo certain things.

18:34.170 --> 18:37.630
Fortunately bryan is consciousand he's breathing on his own.

18:37.630 --> 18:43.450
So what we can do is we canremain professional and we can keep him comfortableuntil help arrives.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.320
Yeah,I can do that.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.650
Stay professional,evan.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.750
I know.I know that it hurts.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.620
But I'm gonna take careof that.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.700
Hold him still.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.930
Grab his head like this?

18:53.930 --> 18:54.810
Okay,sorry,dude.

18:54.810 --> 18:58.950
The coast guardis asking us where we are.

19:10.310 --> 19:14.390
Okay,I'm here.Let's get it over with.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.980
What's going on?

19:18.980 --> 19:20.140
Think.

19:20.140 --> 19:21.860
I don't have timeto play games.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.970
You know,I don't think they've even paintedthis room since then.

19:25.970 --> 19:27.870
Since when?

19:27.870 --> 19:30.550
You need meto jog your memory for you?

19:30.550 --> 19:34.510
You were lying right herecraving a cheeseburger,onion rings,red jell

19:34.510 --> 19:38.890
-o,and,oh,yeah,chocolate shake.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.020
You want me to sign 'em?

19:44.570 --> 19:47.510
Your shoulder was nasty afterthat surfboard jammed into it.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.400
I visited you here every day.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.020
In fact,I thinkI was the only person in the historyof health services

19:52.020 --> 19:55.030
that looked forwardto visiting the hospital.

19:55.030 --> 19:56.360
You have eight minutes left.

19:56.360 --> 20:01.220
Now both of us knowthe chocolate cravings...

20:01.530 --> 20:03.750
That was just an excuse to getyour brother out of the room.

20:03.750 --> 20:07.900
Right,becauseno patient has ever craved chocolatein a hospital.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.610
Come on,you weren't tryingto get rid of josh?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.020
No...

20:12.020 --> 20:15.020
I wasn'T.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.900
Okay,maybe a little.

20:16.900 --> 20:20.410
I know you stilllove me,jill.I can see it in your eyes.

20:20.410 --> 20:23.240
It's over,charlie.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.080
Still havesix minutes left!

20:39.100 --> 20:40.530
Hello?

20:40.530 --> 20:42.270
Hi.Do you have a second?

20:42.270 --> 20:45.170
Do I have a--yeah.I was just calling you.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.780
No,I called you.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.880
Okay,um,did you find boris?

20:49.880 --> 20:50.930
Yes.

20:50.930 --> 20:52.630
Well,is he okay?

20:52.630 --> 20:54.050
That's a complicatedquestion.

20:54.050 --> 20:58.420
I'm not sure of the answerand unfortunately,that's about all I can say.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.850
So how's new york?

21:00.850 --> 21:02.830
Do you rememberthe gardners?

21:02.830 --> 21:05.430
As in "got you fired"gardners?

21:05.430 --> 21:08.050
Yeah,apparentlythat wasn't good enough.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.300
Now they wantmy medical license.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.650
You didn'tdo anything wrong.

21:11.650 --> 21:13.700
I've learnedthat doesn't always matter.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.940
I'm aboutto meet with them.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.090
Well,good,hank.

21:16.090 --> 21:19.290
Just talk to them human beingto human being.

21:19.290 --> 21:22.100
I would,I'm just not surethey are human beings.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.140
Well,then just be hank.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.900
That I can do.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.130
So I'll be thinking of you.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.250
yeah,hank,break a leg.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.100
At least thatI'd know
how to fix. Thank you.

21:37.890 --> 21:40.630
Yeah,all right,the coast guard wants
to know our heading. What's a heading?

21:40.630 --> 21:42.000
Bryan,what's our heading?

21:42.000 --> 21:46.100
196 at 15 knotsbefore we lost the sail.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.740
He said 196,15 knots.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.930
Hey,gumby,are you gonna turn gary in?

21:50.930 --> 21:52.290
Or more importantly,me?

21:52.290 --> 21:54.540
Did you justcall me "gumby"? No,not you.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.380
Okay,they're having troublefinding
a signal from the boat.

21:58.380 --> 22:03.000
There's a scramblerthat was masking
our location from satellites.

22:05.730 --> 22:08.150
The satellites? What...what happened?

22:08.150 --> 22:09.500
What happened? What happened,divya?

22:09.500 --> 22:12.630
He said that therewas a scrambler or
something and then he just passed out.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.520
He hasa tension pneumothorax.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.530
Okay,come help me.

22:15.530 --> 22:18.850
No,I'm tryingto get us found. I
prefer this jobto one involving blood.

22:18.850 --> 22:22.160
- What does that mean?
- His lung is collapsed andI need to relieve the pressure

22:22.160 --> 22:23.910
or it'll stop blood flowto the heart.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.080
Okay,so his lungis collapsed,she said.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.410
Oh,my god.

22:30.230 --> 22:33.240
I'm sorry about that. Welcome back.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.090
Hey,kylie,cut one of
thefingers on this,okay?

22:36.090 --> 22:37.590
Then cut the tip off,all right?

22:37.590 --> 22:39.080
So it makes a tube shape.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.330

It can't wait. I need to

23:15.600 --> 23:18.650
before he damageshis lungs
further or becomes hypoxic.

24:11.270 --> 24:13.560

24:13.560 --> 24:15.900

Okay,you're gonna needto get leverage to
pull the rib cage backto his chest wall.

25:31.310 --> 25:32.390
Let me look something up.

25:32.390 --> 25:34.050
You're gonna be okay,dude.

25:34.050 --> 25:37.630
We're working on
it,okay? I promise. Right?

25:37.630 --> 25:41.280
Okay,good. There's a splinting
methodyou could try,a pulley system.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.140
Wait,we don'thave a pulley system.
It's a boat. We're on a boat,hank.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.860
There's pulleysin the rigging
and extras in the cockpit.

25:46.860 --> 25:51.150
All right,grab twoand you'll need some
weights and a line to attachhis chest to them.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.570
What should we useto
penetrate the chest wall?

25:53.570 --> 25:55.870
Is there any fishing gearon board?

25:55.870 --> 25:58.350
- I saw a tackle boxnear the cockpit.

26:05.290 --> 26:06.890
Hank,this is kylie.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.260
I'm the disgruntled mistress.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.830
Hello. Nice to meet you.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.190
It's 'cause I didn'tgo to
college and I hate retail.

26:13.190 --> 26:16.080
- Alcohol.
- Go get it. Right.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.590

Okay,what do you need?

26:33.910 --> 26:37.400

26:37.930 --> 26:39.050
Okay. Over here.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.100
- You want to bringhis whole body over there?
- Yes.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.130
- Okay,I'm gonnagrab his legs.
- Okay.

26:45.130 --> 26:48.070
On three. One,two,three.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.890
It's gonna be okay,man.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.610
Let's go.

26:57.630 --> 26:59.440
- You see?
- Yeah,I got you.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.570
- Okay.
- Divya,grab the biggest hooksyou can find.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.580
Oh,my god. Okay. Okay,here we go.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.330
Insert the hookbeneath the broken rib.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.050
Remember,the barb on the end
will make it hardto pull out.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.260
Divya,you can do this. Nice and steady.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.440
Are you surethat's the right
spot? Like,how do you know?

27:19.440 --> 27:20.950
Evan,you're not helping.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.790
Bryan,this is gonna hurt.

27:24.790 --> 27:27.960
First hook... going in.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.710
Yeah,it's definitelyin there.

27:33.510 --> 27:35.770
***** A scrambler,but I...

27:36.140 --> 27:38.340
how big can the oceanpossibly be,hon...

27:38.340 --> 27:39.690
all right.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.150
I can't getthe last hook in.

27:41.150 --> 27:42.770
- Well,push harder.
- It's not working.

27:42.770 --> 27:44.710
All right,evan,give divya a hand.

27:44.710 --> 27:47.580
No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no.
I can'T. I can'T.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.680
You know that thisis a medical
business that we're in,right?

27:49.680 --> 27:51.490
Yes,I...hold on a second. Yes.

27:51.490 --> 27:53.310
Asset balance sheets? Me.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.850
Jamming fish hooksinto
people? That's you.

27:55.850 --> 27:58.590
Evan,this isn't optional.
It's the last one. Let's go.

27:58.590 --> 28:00.700
Yeah,make it happen already.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.060
Hello,mr. Coast guard?

28:04.060 --> 28:07.440
Yeah,this is your faultthat
I have to do this. Here.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.080
Just pretend thatit's a game of
"operation. " Put the gloves on.

28:11.080 --> 28:15.730
Yeah,that's a reallyrealistic game.
I'm probably overqualifiedfor this.

28:16.180 --> 28:20.760
Feel for the rib. Oh,my god. It's
definitely brokenand disgusting.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.940
Pierce the skin rightabove the top rib.

28:25.790 --> 28:28.040
- Piercing it.
- All right,evan,you're doing great.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.340
Now ride the pointof the hook
around the backsideof the rib.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.530
**** What the hellare you talking about?

28:33.530 --> 28:38.030
Evan,evan,be careful. You need to stay
closeto the rib or you'll tear an artery.

28:38.030 --> 28:39.850
Do not tearan artery,gilligan.

28:39.850 --> 28:42.380
Okay,why don't you justsay "no pressure"
too? That would really help here.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.330
- Evan,focus.
- Okay.

28:45.330 --> 28:47.320
- Oh,my god.
- Good. Good.

28:47.320 --> 28:51.110
- Follow the curveof the hook.
- It's coming. It's coming. Good. There.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.710
- All right,evan.
- Hank,I'm attachingthe hooks to the line.

28:53.710 --> 28:58.560
Okay,great. Run them throughthe pulley
and attach the weightsto the other side.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.300
Good. Good. Now let them go.

29:06.530 --> 29:07.910
Oh,my god. Oh,my god. It's working.

29:07.910 --> 29:13.540
Okay. I'm gonna take a nap,throw up...

29:14.630 --> 29:16.560
about seven times.

29:19.430 --> 29:22.090
Thank godthey've found us.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.220
- Hank.
- Boris.

29:43.110 --> 29:47.660
Montecristo. One of
fidel'sshining glories.

29:47.660 --> 29:52.580
Sounds impressiveand
illegal. Yeah,I'll take one.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.640
Tough day?

29:57.190 --> 29:58.750
Yeah. You could say that.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.440
Well,look atthe brighter side,hank.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.030
Diane has decided notto charge
you for the use of her laptop.

30:06.530 --> 30:10.840
While I admireyour passion,hank,you
don't haveto do this on your own,huh?

30:11.400 --> 30:16.720
God created lawyersfor a reason and I
can't imagineit was for their joie d'vivre.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.200
Let them help you.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.220
Look,the gardnersare
not getting my license.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.360
It's just not happening.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.280
As well they shouldn't,but let my
team come hereand develop a new plan.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.180
Thanks,but what I needis fresh
air and some time to myself.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.730
Then take my car. Natan will
drive youaround the park.

30:35.730 --> 30:39.360
If I'm with natan,I
wouldn't exactly be alone.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.940
With natan you couldn'tbe
more alone. Believe me.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.620
I'm not going with natan. But thank you.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.120
- I'll see you later.
- Enjoy.

32:13.330 --> 32:14.650
sorry.

32:20.450 --> 32:21.510
Hey,divya.

32:21.510 --> 32:23.430
We're bringing him in
now. How's he doing?

32:23.430 --> 32:29.060
Stable. Better than I would be,given that
he'sbeing held together by parts of a boat.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.010
You did good. I'm proud of you.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.790
Listen. This one was a reallyclose one.

32:34.790 --> 32:37.140
I'm ready for youto come back,dr. Hank.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.190
Yeah,I'll be backin a few hours
and things will returnto normal.

32:40.190 --> 32:44.450
Okay,great. Only I'm notexactly
sure I know what normal is anymore.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.240
Yeah,that makes twoof us.

32:46.240 --> 32:51.170
I'm telling you,if I pull through
this,no more scramblersor getaway driver.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.400
- What do you mean "if"?
- No,no,no. The doctors are gonnastitch you right up,man.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.200
And before you know it you'llbe
back on the big blue sea.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.200
You're gonna be looking upat the
stars and grilling up some fish.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.750
Are those fish hooks?

33:01.750 --> 33:05.170
Or ribs. Or chicken
is also goodto grill.

33:05.710 --> 33:09.180
I just got seducedby the yacht
and the toysand the money.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.030
Yeah,moneyisn't everything.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.740
Or so I've been told.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.970
Thanksfor everything,huh?

33:14.970 --> 33:18.130
You know,it's...it's what I do.

33:54.140 --> 33:56.710
- I need you.
- I'm sorry,boris. Look,I'm going home.

33:56.710 --> 33:59.310
Hank,it's getting worse.

33:59.310 --> 34:02.760
- Where are you?
- Somewherein battery park.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.820
Okay,look,I'll meet youby the memorial.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.440
- No,I can't get there.
- Why not?

34:09.389 --> 34:11.050
I'm quite blind.

34:18.270 --> 34:19.770
Can you see anything?

34:20.540 --> 34:24.040
Shapes. It's very blurry.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.000
All right,thank you.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.540
Okay,I'm gonna roll upyour shirt sleeve.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.219
That appeared this morning.

34:33.219 --> 34:35.429
- Why didn't you mention it?
- I didn't see the point.

34:35.429 --> 34:38.090
I'm your doctor. That's the point.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.550
It's worsening,yes?

34:41.550 --> 34:43.320
Are you takingany medications?

34:43.320 --> 34:46.449
Because I don'tthink your
sight loss is from your disease.

34:46.449 --> 34:49.719
That rash is emanatingfrom
an injection site.

34:50.449 --> 34:53.750
You've lost your vision and havea
morbilliform rash spreading across your body.

34:53.750 --> 34:57.370
What are you waiting
for,paralysis? Death?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.550
I've given myselfsome injections.

35:00.550 --> 35:02.200
Injections.

35:03.590 --> 35:06.290
The shark. That's what it was for.

35:06.290 --> 35:08.470
You got a shark to
harvestits embryonic cells.

35:08.470 --> 35:10.980
- Very good,detective.
- What were you thinking?

35:11.450 --> 35:13.600
Regulate my immune system,hank.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.400
- Try anything I can.
- Then let me help.

35:33.140 --> 35:37.010
- Well,to say I'm surprisedwould be an understatement.
- Well,I did all I could.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.810
Do I have to check themto
make sure you signed them?

35:38.810 --> 35:40.360
What do you think?

35:54.530 --> 35:56.600
You never change.

35:57.730 --> 36:01.760
You are still just a little kidwho
does what he wants when he wants.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.430
Jill,you're all I want.

36:03.430 --> 36:08.080
Now you tell me when I walkedthrough that door that
there wasn't a part of youthat was happy to see me.

36:09.610 --> 36:11.870
It was nice to see you.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.770
You're my wife.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.850
And you're the only womanI ever loved.

36:34.780 --> 36:35.980
All right.

36:35.980 --> 36:40.400
The symptomswill diminish as the
foreign proteins clearyour system.

36:40.400 --> 36:46.990
Till that time,these steroids I'm giving you
will decrease your body'sinflammatory response.

36:46.990 --> 36:52.390
How can you be so surethat the symptoms
aren't a partof my particular condition?

36:52.390 --> 36:57.300
Well,loss of vision,that rash are
manifestationsof serum sickness.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.420
An immune reactionto heterologous
proteins introduced into the body.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.920
The shark cells.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.550
Maybe the musclecontractions
are part of that reaction too.

37:04.550 --> 37:07.480
We won't know untilthe
proteins clear your system.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.760
Where did you getthe idea to do that?

37:09.760 --> 37:12.460
There's research going onyou
have no idea about,hank.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.450
Boris,you haveto stop immediately.

37:14.450 --> 37:16.420
It's not medicine
you'reputting into your body.

37:16.420 --> 37:18.810
I don't have the luxuryto
be selective,do I?

37:18.810 --> 37:21.160
For once,boris,trust me.

37:21.860 --> 37:24.380
It's why you hired mein
the first place,isn't it?

37:29.890 --> 37:31.850
I can't read that. What does it say?

37:31.850 --> 37:34.840
- "Blue skies."
- Then it's meant for you.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.160
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.400
Your medical license,it's safe.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.130
How? What did you do?

37:42.130 --> 37:43.900
Who's to sayI did anything?

37:43.900 --> 37:48.740
Perhaps the gardnerswere
moved by your idealism.

37:50.340 --> 37:52.520
Much as I am now.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.960
- You leave me alone,hank?
- Sure.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.400
Well,yeah. No. No,I understand.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.790
You're saying,how much?

38:15.740 --> 38:17.880
Yeah,I missed you too.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.610
Divya. How's the captain doing?

38:21.610 --> 38:25.130
Oh,he's itchingto get back on the
boat,which I take is a good sign.

38:25.130 --> 38:27.190
Great. How are you doing?

38:27.190 --> 38:29.620
Very happyto be on solid ground.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.980
I'm gonna go knockon jill's door.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.870
All right,I'm gonna try toget
your brother off the phone.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.460
Good luck with that.

38:35.430 --> 38:37.130
Well,yeah,sorry about that,man.

38:37.130 --> 38:40.130
Let me call you. Absolutely. Bye.

38:40.430 --> 38:41.460
Shall we?

38:41.460 --> 38:43.940
So that was oneof pastotnik's posse.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.740
And he just saidthat if we ride
the chopper with the mistressand go

38:46.740 --> 38:49.160
and see the big dog that
he'll quadruplethe payment.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.380
He will quadruple it.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.280
Okay,evan,you're not
seriously considering doing...

38:52.280 --> 38:57.140
no,no,no. I told himto tell the big dog that
we can't be bought,at least not by fugitives.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.830
You know,if they actually havecriminal
charges pending,that's a different story.

39:00.830 --> 39:03.400
Evan,are you developinga conscience?

39:03.400 --> 39:06.670
I am constantlyevolving,yeah.

39:06.670 --> 39:11.910
- So about beforeon the boat...
- you were very impressive.

39:11.910 --> 39:13.330
I was?

39:13.860 --> 39:17.430
And,uh...and I was wrong.

39:18.050 --> 39:19.250
You were?

39:19.250 --> 39:21.320
I thought you wereall about the money...

39:21.820 --> 39:23.760
but apparently you're not.

39:23.760 --> 39:27.950
So... I'm sorry.

39:30.750 --> 39:31.830
I don't know what to say.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.630
Then don't say anything.

39:34.270 --> 39:35.850
Gumby.

39:38.330 --> 39:40.330
Why gumby?

39:51.860 --> 39:54.200
- So how'd it go?
- 'm not sure.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.120
- My license seemsto be safe.
- Well,that's great news.

39:57.120 --> 40:02.340
Yes,it is. But the lawsuits
haven'tbeen dropped,so blah.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.940
Right.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.910
So how was it beingin the city?

40:08.910 --> 40:10.410
Great.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.560
Great.

40:15.090 --> 40:19.710
Being back theremade me realize
this is whereI want to be.

40:20.470 --> 40:21.940
It is?

40:22.310 --> 40:28.030
Remember you asked meif I planned
on staying past the summer? I do.

40:28.570 --> 40:31.110
And I'd like to with you.

40:36.110 --> 40:37.600
Right.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.190
Okay,um,here's the thing.

40:42.870 --> 40:49.470
I don't know if I can...
be with you... right now.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.240
Okay,why not?

40:55.810 --> 41:01.490
Because... I still have to
figure thingsout with my husband.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.730
Okay. Got it.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.460
Can you just pick a channel?

41:30.460 --> 41:33.540
I'll pick a channelwhen I find
something worth picking,okay?

41:33.540 --> 41:37.340
How can you knowwhat's good? You're
on each channelfor,like,two seconds.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.800
- There,you happy?
- Oh,yeah,that's funny. Oh,that's really funny.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.580
Let me get a beer.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.660
Boris.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.840

My family medical history.

41:57.010 --> 42:00.410
Doctor. Boris,I can't read german.

42:00.410 --> 42:03.040
I never saidit would be easy.

42:05.410 --> 42:08.830
- See you later,hank.
