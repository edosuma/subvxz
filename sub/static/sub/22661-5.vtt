WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:04.238
Oh, hey, I'll take the kids
to school.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.673
I want to talk
to the principal, again,

00:05.706 --> 00:07.608
about letting Kate play
on the boys' soccer team.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.610
Why are you making yourself
crazy with this?

00:09.643 --> 00:11.412
Even if the school agrees,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.781
you know the boys
are gonna be jerks about it.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.683
Remember that Disney movie

00:15.716 --> 00:17.418
where they put the donkey
on the football team

00:17.451 --> 00:18.652
to kick the field goals?

00:19.653 --> 00:22.390
He did not fit in.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.758
Yeah, I remember that movie.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.295
They went all the way to
the Super Bowl with that donkey.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.464
Okay, kiddos, finish up.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.300
We're out the door
in two minutes.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.502
Hey, Adam. We met a guy at
breakfast who wants to apply to

00:34.535 --> 00:36.704
be foreman of the mini-mall job.
Oh, is he any good?

00:36.737 --> 00:38.372
Been running a
table saw 25 years

00:38.406 --> 00:40.441
and is only missing
one finger.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.610
Put him on top of the pile.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.246
I can't wait until
there's a new guy at work.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.514
I've gotten enough guff.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.182
It's time for me
to dish some out.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.518
And believe you me,
I've got guff to give.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.521
You keep using
words like "guff,"

00:53.554 --> 00:56.390
I doubt your life
is gonna change much.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.493
Hey, uh, just out of curiosity,
why does it have to be a guy?

00:59.527 --> 01:00.228
What do you mean?

01:00.261 --> 01:02.263
Well, all the applicants
are men.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.864
Well, the job is foreman.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.267
It's for a man.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.537
No, that's not why.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.871
Okay, look, my crew

01:10.904 --> 01:12.440
are big, tough guys,

01:12.473 --> 01:13.841
so I need an even bigger,
tougher guy

01:13.874 --> 01:15.543
to boss them around.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.511
Plus, we have Porta-Potties.
Those things don't flush.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.447
It's no place for a lady.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.482
You are the father
of two daughters.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.185
Would you want Emme and Kate
being denied opportunities?

01:24.218 --> 01:27.155
At a construction site? Yes.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.857
Look, I do what I do

01:29.890 --> 01:31.692
so they can have
the kind of namby-pamby jobs

01:31.725 --> 01:36.197
where your boss has a ponytail
and you can call in sad.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.200
So, women can only do
namby-pamby jobs?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.635
No, no, I just...

01:49.543 --> 01:52.513
Why is everyone so quiet?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.515
'Cause you're about
to get it, Dad.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.152
No, no, no, no, no.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.521
We are having a friendly
talk that I am gonna win.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.922
Okay?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.857
But just in case I don't,
go wait in the car.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.527
I bet Mom says a bad word.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.396
Oh, I bet she says
all of them.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.664
How many bad words are there?

02:10.698 --> 02:14.435
Four big ones and there's,
like, 12 words for butt.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.841
Okay, look, I'm-I'm not saying
women are worse than men.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.777
I'm just saying
they're different.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.347
Why did we even go see
Wonder Woman?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.517
What? It's true.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.252
Why can't we say it?

02:31.285 --> 02:34.688
Because there are
other people in the room.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.361
Look, men are better
at some things

02:40.394 --> 02:42.863
and women are better at others.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.433
You know, I have to say...
(clucks tongue)

02:45.466 --> 02:46.900
you're kind of being a sexist.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.837
Okay, well, you
don't have to say it.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.672
Look, I am not a
sexist. All right?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.675
I'm just saying what everyone
else is thinking. Right, guys?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.377
Uh, I completely agree with you,

02:56.410 --> 02:57.978
as soon as she leaves.

02:58.011 --> 03:03.684
I would hire a woman because,
again, I am not a sexist.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
But no women want this job.

03:05.386 --> 03:09.223
Uh-huh. A-And where did you
advertise for this job?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.660
I told these guys.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.897
You know there
are websites

03:16.930 --> 03:18.899
with qualified people
looking for jobs.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.734
Maybe you should
look there.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.470
Fine. I will.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.637
And I bet there'll be
some women on there.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.738
I'll bet there will.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.774
And you should find one.
I will.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.442
And interview her.
Fine.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.943
Fine.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.720
I've never seen anyone
lose that slowly before.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.626
Okay, Leonard, thanks
for stopping by.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.296
Oh, here, take this with you.
No need to waste it.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.698
(chuckles)

03:50.731 --> 03:52.833
He totally failed my "what's
your favorite lunch" question.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.836
Caesar salad? (scoffs)
He's not one of us.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.506
We've interviewed
seven guys today

03:58.539 --> 03:59.640
and none of them
are any good.
Yeah, well,

03:59.673 --> 04:02.009
all right, we're almost done.
We just got one more.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.444
A lady.
Really?

04:03.477 --> 04:04.645
You actually did that?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.480
Yeah, because I am not a sexist.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.048
So, we're gonna
interview this girl,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.851
who's never gonna get the job,
and then grab some lunch.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.321
(knock at door)
All right, that's
her, so remember,

04:13.354 --> 04:15.856
she's just a person trying to
get a job, so act professional.

04:15.889 --> 04:16.857
Goes without saying.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.792
Come on in.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.328
Hey.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.662
I'm Zara.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.498
Hey, mama.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.903
*

04:40.080 --> 04:40.881
So, Zara, uh,

04:40.914 --> 04:42.049
what do you like
about construction?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.617
What's there not to like?

04:43.651 --> 04:46.487
I get to smash stuff,
get to drive big machines,

04:46.520 --> 04:47.821
and when you're finished,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.757
there's something there
that wasn't there before.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.760
Good answer.
Mm, yeah.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.663
The last guy said he liked
how easy it was to quit.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.599
I see you went to college.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.667
In this job,
we build colleges.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.702
We don't go to them.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.438
If you look at the next line,
you'll see that I got a degree

05:04.472 --> 05:05.773
in construction management.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.742
Oh, a big fancy
college girl.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.444
I'm sorry. I can't
give you guff.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.645
You seem lovely.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.515
Zara, the issue
I'm having here

05:14.548 --> 05:16.850
is you don't have a ton
of on-site experience.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.587
Yeah, it's hard for a woman
to get a job on a work site.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.922
Guys just hire other guys.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.692
What?
What?
What?

05:24.725 --> 05:27.428
Look, I have enough
experience to know

05:27.461 --> 05:28.996
that you'd already
have your roof up

05:29.029 --> 05:31.799
if your guys weren't shooting
dice behind that forklift.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.767
Don, you said you were
gonna handle that.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.570
I did. They cut
us in for 20%.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.472
That's how we got
the fancy coffee maker.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.673
I'll take care of this.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.481
ZARA: Hey! Get
back to work!

05:47.515 --> 05:50.017
Every minute you're on your
ass, I'm docking your pay!

05:50.050 --> 05:52.386
Oh, they're moving now.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.888
Look, Big Ernie just ran
into a hole.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.024
Oh, it's okay. Little
Ernie is helping him out.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.127
Ah. Now they're both
in the hole.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.098
Nice guys.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.834
Very impressive.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.802
I haven't seen Big
Ernie run that fast

06:08.836 --> 06:11.539
since his ex-wife
came down here.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.140
You know, I-I think
she's hired.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.743
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
I have one last question.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.812
If you were ordering lunch
today, what would you get?

06:18.846 --> 06:19.780
Oh, answer's
always chili.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.882
Yeah, she's hired.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.584
This is amazing.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.586
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.888
You won't regret it.
I will work my tail off for you.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.022
Hey, you earned it.

06:29.056 --> 06:29.990
I'm sorry. Before you go...

06:31.158 --> 06:32.426
You look so familiar.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.527
Have we met?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.796
(laughs)
Nice try, gramps.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.902
No, I-I really think I know her.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.737
It's because she's attractive.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.138
It happens to me all the time.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.675
People see this
and they think they know me.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.579
Although, often, they just
think I'm Rachel Maddow.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.880
This is so great.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.848
Not only is Zara perfect
for the job,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.917
but when Andi sees
that I hired a woman,

06:56.950 --> 06:59.086
she's gonna feel bad
for calling me a sexist.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.521
Then you know
what I'm gonna see?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.456
Regret face.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.693
Ah, regret face, the rarest of
all the wife faces.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.995
I saw a touch of that
on my wedding day.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.900
Hey, honey.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.568
Welcome home.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.239
Wow, you seem chipper.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.943
Ah, just a great day
to be alive.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.646
I was very productive,
met a lot of guys,

07:25.679 --> 07:26.914
hired a new foreman.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.683
Oh, yeah? Did you go
with Mr. Nine Fingers?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.151
No, no.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.253
No, not him.
Went with someone else.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.123
This one's got body parts
the other guys wish they had.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.991
Okay, so, get this.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.193
I just got off the phone
with Kate's principal

07:40.227 --> 07:42.496
and he said the administration
would discuss

07:42.530 --> 07:43.731
putting Kate on the team.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.865
They don't mean that.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.834
That's the same trick
I use on you.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.002
Sexism.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.740
It is the scourge
of our country,

07:52.773 --> 07:54.107
but what are you gonna do?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
(doorbell rings)

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
Oh, that's probably
the new foreman coming by

07:57.244 --> 07:58.546
to get the start paperwork.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.813
I'll get it.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.915
I'm very excited
to get it.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.754
Andi, meet the new guy.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.055
It's a lady.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.862
Hey. I'm Zara.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.196
Zara, this is my wife, Andi.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.598
Hey.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.833
That stunned look
on her face is, uh,

08:19.867 --> 08:20.834
it's 'cause
she's not used

08:20.868 --> 08:22.570
to seeing women in construction.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.938
She's kind of old-fashioned.
(laughs)

08:26.273 --> 08:28.108
Here's your, uh,
here's your paperwork.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.143
Great, thanks.
Yeah.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.279
Oh, was there a reason why you
didn't just e-mail this to me?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.947
Yes, yes, there was.
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:38.251 --> 08:43.591
Wait a second, you actually
hired a woman as your foreman?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.793
Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.962
Perhaps now you'd like to
take back calling me a sexist?

08:48.996 --> 08:50.230
I mean, that word
starts off great,

08:50.263 --> 08:52.666
but then goes
downhill real fast.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.135
You know what...

08:55.168 --> 08:57.270
maybe I misjudged you.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.941
There it is.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.045
The regret face. Oh.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.147
It's just,
it's so beautiful.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.315
I almost can't look
straight at it.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.583
It's like an eclipse.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.252
(laughs)
No, I'm serious.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.154
I'm so proud of you.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.723
Yeah?
Yeah, I mean, you were

09:15.756 --> 09:17.057
a dusty old seed

09:17.090 --> 09:19.960
and now you're-you're
just, you're blossoming

09:19.993 --> 09:21.962
into a beautiful
flower husband.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.099
I really am.
Yeah, I'm, uh,

09:26.133 --> 09:27.901
I'm-I'm changing
people's lives.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.970
I think they're gonna
put me on a stamp.
(laughs)

09:31.972 --> 09:35.008
Hey. I was waiting in my car
for Zara to leave.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.044
I figured out
how I know her.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.080
What?
She was a dancer
at the Tassel Castle.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.317
What? I thought that
place closed down.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.056
(clears throat)

09:49.089 --> 09:51.992
I mean, what's
the Tassel Castle?

09:52.025 --> 09:54.728
It's the-the strip club
down at the airport.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.731
Oh, Don.

09:57.765 --> 10:01.068
And a little bit Adam.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.037
I think our new foreman may have
left something off her résumé.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.739
Wha...

10:05.773 --> 10:08.742
is he saying that you hired
an exotic dancer?

10:08.776 --> 10:11.244
Apparently.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.815
Although, I don't know why
he's saying it in front of you.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.218
Oh, Adam.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.854
And now only Adam.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.223
No, no, no, no.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.658
You-you were proud of me.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.659
I was blossoming.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.094
I was...

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
I was gonna be on a stamp.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.099
Ugh.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.001
I guess this isn't the first
time an airport stripper

10:34.034 --> 10:35.736
ruined a husband's day.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.979
Hey, don't be mad
at me, be mad at Don--

10:46.013 --> 10:47.114
he went to
the strip club.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.849
Bad Don.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.283
I didn't go
for the girls,

10:50.317 --> 10:51.985
Marcy and I used to go
for the hot wings.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.221
You get in free
if you bring your wife.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.024
That's a real peek
behind the curtain.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.759
No, no, no, you can't go
behind the curtain.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.260
They're very serious
about that.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.796
And I'm sure it was Zara.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.798
She was going by the name
Amber Breeze.

11:06.099 --> 11:10.771
I am just not comfortable
with you working ten hours a day

11:10.804 --> 11:13.173
with somebody who used to dance
for schlumpy perverts.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.308
Hey. Don't call
my wife schlumpy.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.744
Geez.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.114
Uh... okay,

11:21.148 --> 11:22.049
so, you want me
to fire her

11:22.082 --> 11:23.784
because she used to
dance for a living?

11:23.817 --> 11:25.052
That sounds sexist.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.854
You're the sexist!

11:26.887 --> 11:28.055
That is not what I meant.
Okay, yeah,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.356
I know what you meant.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.091
And frankly,
it saddens me.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.494
Okay, how could you, the
mother of two daughters,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.163
be so judgmental?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.031
That's women keeping women
down, that's what that is.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.868
I am not a sexist.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.137
I just... I'm suspicious
of strippers.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.174
So she's a stripperist.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.378
Look, I believe

11:51.411 --> 11:54.782
that any woman should be able
to have any job. Right?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.817
Unless she's a stripper
and it's with my husband.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.118
I mean, come on,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.753
you're out there
building things

11:59.787 --> 12:01.121
and getting all sweaty.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.791
I mean, you're so sexy
when you're sweaty.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.292
I am?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.196
Oh. I've been
taking showers

12:09.229 --> 12:11.064
all these years
like an idiot.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.803
She has to go.
All right?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.104
There is not a wife
in America

12:17.137 --> 12:18.972
who would disagree with me.
Okay, wait, hang on,

12:19.006 --> 12:20.507
hang on, we're getting
all bent out of shape

12:20.540 --> 12:23.276
about something Don says he
remembers seeing years ago.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.813
I mean, Amber Breeze?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.015
I'm pretty sure that's the
name of the air freshener

12:28.048 --> 12:29.349
in the Porta-Potties.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.853
Look, look.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.354
Before we do anything,

12:34.387 --> 12:37.190
we have to find out
if it's even true.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.992
Okay, well,
you said you were sure.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.227
How confident are you?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.163
Very.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.098
Like 50-50.

12:49.102 --> 12:49.970
Hey, did you hear
anything from school

12:50.003 --> 12:51.471
about me playing on
the boys' soccer team?

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206
Oh, not yet.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.075
Are you sure you really
want to do this?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.944
I mean, I've been telling
you since you were two:

12:56.977 --> 12:59.412
stay away from boys,
they are gross.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.414
I just want to be
on the best team.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.884
Okay, okay,

13:03.917 --> 13:05.218
but those boys
only want one thing

13:05.252 --> 13:08.121
and it's not for you
to play the goalie.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.193
Honey, she's growing up.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
She's gonna be blocking
a lot of balls.
Don't...

13:21.301 --> 13:22.469
Don't do that.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.105
That's my baby.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.207
All right, look, Zara's
gonna be here any minute

13:27.240 --> 13:28.508
to go over these
blueprints with me

13:28.541 --> 13:30.243
and then we'll just ask her
if she was a dancer.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.279
Well, no, we can't
just ask her.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.347
I mean, if we're wrong, we're
just gonna look like jerks.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.883
Okay, uh, oh.
Well, how about

13:35.916 --> 13:37.150
if I drop a dollar
bill on the floor

13:37.184 --> 13:38.451
and we see how
she picks it up?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.153
Huh?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.225
I mean, if she, like,
if she, like,

13:45.258 --> 13:48.195
crawls across the floor
to get it, case closed.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.031
Or we could try
literally anything else.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.301
Fine, we'll do it
the slow way.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.137
Okay, and if it turns out
to be true, she's out.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.271
(knocking at door)

13:58.305 --> 13:59.907
I'll get the door.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.477
Hey, come on in.
Hey.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.114
I stopped by the job site
to get the guys started

14:07.147 --> 14:10.450
and I noticed that the whole
crew wasn't wearing shirts.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.518
Is that normal?

14:11.551 --> 14:12.986
No, they're just not used

14:13.020 --> 14:14.254
to having a girl around.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.622
They're trying to impress you.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.258
Well, I was impressed by
the amount of back hair.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.295
Hey, uh, you know,
speaking of not wearing shirts,

14:22.329 --> 14:25.232
Andi, do you think it's weird
to not wear a shirt at your job?

14:25.265 --> 14:28.068
Well, yeah, I mean, I've
always worn shirts at my job.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.970
You know.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.339
But I bet there are
some jobs out there

14:32.372 --> 14:34.074
where-where you
don't have to.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.242
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.409
Like a lifeguard.
Mmm.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.012
Or a TV show
lifeguard.
Right.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.148
Uh...

14:41.181 --> 14:42.649
Zara, can you think of any more?

14:42.682 --> 14:45.252
Lion tamer.

14:45.285 --> 14:49.622
True. True, true, true, true,
yeah, very true, yeah.
Hmm, yeah.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.131
(quietly):
No.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.104
Uh, you know, I know
it's kind of early,

15:04.137 --> 15:05.405
but, boy, I would like a beer.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.107
Andi, what's the name
of that beer you like?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.308
Amber something?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.078
I don't know,
I'll drink anything.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.946
Andi...

15:12.980 --> 15:15.015
The beer Don
was talking about.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.349
(mouths)
Oh!

15:16.383 --> 15:19.086
Oh, set me up again.
(scoffs)

15:19.119 --> 15:20.420
You know, I had--
all right,

15:20.453 --> 15:22.389
I've had enough of this, okay?
Hey, Zara,

15:22.422 --> 15:23.556
you know, uh, we heard

15:23.590 --> 15:26.126
that... you might have been

15:26.159 --> 15:28.661
a dancer at the Tassel Castle.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.398
Yes, I was a stripper.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.402
Well, there it is.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.239
Okay, uh, Zara...
ZARA: Wait.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.108
Is this gonna be a problem?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.043
Because I really don't want
to lose this job.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.345
You guys are the only ones
that gave me a chance.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.259
Andi?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.128
What, it's-it's none of my
business who you hire.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.996
I don't like
to get involved.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.067
Look, it's...

16:07.100 --> 16:09.669
it's not like the Tassel Castle
was my dream job.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.570
My parents didn't
approve of me

16:10.603 --> 16:13.540
doing construction
because I was a woman.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.574
They wouldn't pay
for my school,

16:14.607 --> 16:17.510
so I had to find a job
where I could work nights,

16:17.544 --> 16:20.647
go to school during the day and
make enough money to pay for it.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.282
I did what I had to do.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.052
And I know some people
might judge me.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.056
But I don't care.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.523
I'm proud of myself.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.324
I wasn't gonna
let anybody

16:31.358 --> 16:34.061
tell me how
I could live my life.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.428
Wow, that...

16:35.462 --> 16:37.397
that is so inspiring.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.433
I can't believe
you even thought

16:40.467 --> 16:42.102
about firing
her over this!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.640
Man...

16:47.674 --> 16:49.676
Zara's been through some stuff.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.379
Yeah, her parents, huh?
Yeah, what were they thinking?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.414
I don't know, but... (scoffs)
that was quite a story.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.115
I know.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.051
Well, every dancer has a story.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.658
How do you know?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.695
Don told me.
Uh-huh.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.499
(Kate sighs heavily)

17:12.532 --> 17:15.168
I just got an e-mail
from the principal.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.303
They decided that
I'm not allowed

17:16.336 --> 17:17.504
to play on the boys' team.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.339
Oh, honey,
I'm so sorry.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.808
I just, I don't understand
why it's such a big deal.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.511
I don't like people telling me
how to live my life.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.481
You know what?
Neither do I.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.583
You want to play on the
boys' soccer team, we're
gonna make it happen.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.352
Go upstairs, get your
brother and sister--

17:32.385 --> 17:33.786
we're all gonna take you
to school today, okay?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.290
What's gotten into you?

17:37.324 --> 17:40.193
You heard Zara's story--
her parents didn't support her,

17:40.227 --> 17:43.396
she ended up spinning
her tassels down at the airport.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.601
Andi, what is our number one job
as parents?

17:48.635 --> 17:50.437
To... give our kids...

17:50.470 --> 17:52.339
love and security?
Nah.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.406
That's number two
and number three.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.575
Number one is to keep our
daughter off the pole.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.879
Okay?

17:59.912 --> 18:04.351
So I am gonna make damn
sure that I support Katie.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.454
Ooh. You're getting
all sweaty.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.723
I like it.
Oh.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.560
Really? Okay, all right, well,
keep that on a low simmer,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.595
and we'll meet back here
for lunch, okay?
Okay.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.630
All right. Uh, how-- how
sweaty do you want me?

18:17.664 --> 18:21.334
Like a... like a farmer,
or late for a plane?

18:21.368 --> 18:24.137
Like a farmer
who's late for a plane.

18:25.505 --> 18:29.542
Wow. Never a dull moment
with you. Ha-ha!

18:29.576 --> 18:31.478
*

18:33.513 --> 18:35.548
Okay, my wife has something
to say, so I am gonna stand here

18:35.582 --> 18:37.184
and make sure you listen to her.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.318
Huh?

18:38.351 --> 18:39.786
Release the
kraken, honey.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.255
You know, I have listened
to all of your excuses

18:42.289 --> 18:43.523
about how it's
not practical

18:43.556 --> 18:45.192
to have a girl
on the boys' team,

18:45.225 --> 18:46.426
but the bottom line is,

18:46.459 --> 18:47.660
you're the one
that's been stopping it,

18:47.694 --> 18:49.762
because you're a sexist.
(chuckles) Boom!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.664
Sexist. Boom!

18:51.698 --> 18:54.367
Yeah, and I'm not just
gonna say that to your face,

18:54.401 --> 18:56.169
I'm gonna say it
on the Internet.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.604
I'm on Twitter.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.272
Okay? I have 18 followers.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.907
And they all
have followers, too.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.642
I'm gonna make you
go viral.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.444
So you need
to ask yourself:

19:04.477 --> 19:06.679
which side of history
do you want to be on?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.481
Oh. Boom. History.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.583
(mouths)

19:14.554 --> 19:16.823
So, what happened?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.426
You're in.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.361
(laughing):
Really? Yes!

19:21.394 --> 19:22.829
Thank you!
Oh, hey...

19:22.862 --> 19:24.831
Don't thank me--
your mom did it.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.599
Yeah, you should
have seen his face.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.536
Is that what I look like
when you yell at me?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.704
You guys are awesome.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.673
So, you want
to walk me to class?
No, we can't.

19:33.706 --> 19:37.644
We have to be escorted
out by security.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.448

19:43.250 --> 19:44.951
(sighs)

19:44.984 --> 19:48.721
No, no, no.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.591
What? The whole crew's doing it.
It's Fresh Air Friday.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.628
That's not a thing.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.563
It isn't?
Nah.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.265
Don!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.233
Well, I can't put
my shirt on now--

20:00.267 --> 20:01.668
I'm covered in baby oil.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.743
Hey, honey.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.745
How was soccer practice?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.548
We're still not allowed
back on campus.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.987
You were right.
Boys are gross.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.324
You got to get me
back on the girls' team.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.964
The kids do this
to us every time.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.401
(sighs)

20:34.434 --> 20:36.469
They get excited
about something,

20:36.503 --> 20:38.004
we make it happen,
and then they quit.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.308
Hey, guys. I was thinking
about playing the clarinet.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.709
No.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.011
But I really want to.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.713
No, you don't.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.949
Yeah, you're right.
I'll just go play video games.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.784
There you go.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.324
And that's how we're
doing that from now on.
(scoffs): Yeah.
