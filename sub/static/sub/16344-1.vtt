00:06.548 --> 00:09.258
It's about to come, it's about to come,
it's about to come.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.225
In your face, in your hair.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.659
I can't believe
you bid $1200 for this.

00:35.827 --> 00:39.288
I have a really good feeling
about this. Trust me.

00:46.463 --> 00:51.216
Yesb you bought this all.

00:51.801 --> 00:56.638
And now you're rollin' in this heap.

00:56.806 --> 01:01.018
But you paid You paid.

01:01.478 --> 01:06.815
You paid for this dirty Berber rug.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.693
Which isn't actually so bad...

01:09.861 --> 01:13.489
because I think you can get
these stains out with a little club soda.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.664
This is all worthless.
Keep looking. We'll find something.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.335
Bingo. Shh.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.255
This is ridiculous, Michelle,
it's such a waste of time.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.174
What's that?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.804
"Found footage" that we found.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.849
Wouldn't it be amazing if it was one of those
celebrity sex tapes and we could sell.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.643
My God, my God. Put it in.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.603
All right.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.782
Carlsbad Police, what's your emergency?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.200
Five.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.535
Excuse me?

01:59.702 --> 02:01.620
Five.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.622
Five.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.457
Five what, ma'am?

02:05.625 --> 02:11.839
Five dollar footlong.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.716
- Ma'am, what's your emergency?
- I'm a man, douche bag.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.719
My voice is altered because
I've got eight demons in me...

02:17.887 --> 02:19.388
all taking turns to speak.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.431
- Anyway, I killed five people.
- I'm sorry?

02:21.599 --> 02:25.227
I served them six-inch tuna subs
that I wiped my ass with.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.355
- They all died from toxoplasmosis.
- Who?

02:28.523 --> 02:31.567
The entire cast of The Artist
including that dog Uggie.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.860
What?

02:33.027 --> 02:34.444
Send the police, jerk-off.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.781
And if you're hungry,
I still have half a sandwich left.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.664
The Carlsbad community
was leveled by tragedy today...

02:45.832 --> 02:48.000
as three clergy members
were found dead.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.128
47 p.m. in the evening...

02:51.296 --> 02:55.507
there was a call into our office
in a facsimile...

02:55.675 --> 03:01.889
saying that there may have been
or might be a murder situation.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.851
But we cannot confirm or deny
that the cast of the film The Artist...

03:06.019 --> 03:09.563
has been murdered
in the basement of this house.

03:09.731 --> 03:14.818
I, myself, am not a fan of the film.
Didn't really get it.

03:22.368 --> 03:26.788
Hi, my name is Dana Rosti
and we're shooting a documentary.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.791
Why are you shooting a documentary?

03:29.959 --> 03:32.085
Well, when I was 10 years old...

03:32.253 --> 03:35.422
my father murdered some people
in our basement.

03:35.590 --> 03:40.761
And I just found out that he murdered them
while an exorcism was being performed.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.387
On him.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.847
By clowns.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.099
Without his pants.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.977
I'm sorry, can we stop for a second?

03:50.438 --> 03:54.441
After six months of going to trial,
my dad was proven not guilty...

03:54.609 --> 03:58.403
based on insanity,
but I didn't believe that.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.405
Wait a minute.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.911
Yeah! Aah! Aah!

04:06.579 --> 04:09.248
It's the Olympics. Whoo!

04:09.457 --> 04:12.459
Ooh! Hello.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.048
How about a five-way?

04:18.216 --> 04:22.386
A year later, he was transferred to one of the
top psychiatric facilities in the world...

04:23.054 --> 04:27.349
which happens to be in Italy,
which is, like, in a whole other country.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.104
- Are we recording?
- We're on.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.356
- And this is camera one?
- Yeah.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.733
And this is camera two?

04:36.901 --> 04:38.568
And this is the Steadicam.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.487
And this is my 3D camera?

04:44.325 --> 04:47.536
And this is my motion-capture camera?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.747
Okay.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.416
Let's do this.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.918
You came on a very good day today,
Miss Rosti.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.422
Your father is in very high spirits.

04:59.215 --> 05:02.926
Italy had cutting-edge equipment,
brilliant doctors.

05:03.094 --> 05:07.014
I need three CCs
of marinara, stat.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.225
So listen, there's a good chance
he might not even remember you.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.477
Okay.
Don't take offense to that.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.272
It's just part of the disease.
Right.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.574
Okay.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.618
Let's just go
with one camera, okay? Great.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.755
Dad? Do you remember me?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.342
Connect the dots.

05:45.219 --> 05:49.181
Connect the dots. Connect the dots.
Connect the dots.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.932
Connecticut. No, dumb-ass.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.810
Connect the dots.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.271
I'd rather play Candy Land or Jenga
or something...

05:56.439 --> 05:58.690
I'd rather play Connect the Dots
and Dana Shut Up.

05:58.858 --> 05:59.983
Okay.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.700
Great. Now, give me your phone.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.285
What? Give me your phone.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.412
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.998
I'm getting it out of my purse.
Give me your phone.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.170
And, bam!

06:20.338 --> 06:24.758
You just bought me two Taiwanese hookers
for the price of one on Croupon.

06:25.927 --> 06:30.180
Listen, I came here because I have
to tell you something really important.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.474
Shh.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.192
Dad. Now, get out of here!

06:42.360 --> 06:44.361
I ain't got time for you no more.

06:44.529 --> 06:48.490
"Out," he said. Away with you.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.327
Out. I'm a pretty princess.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.579
- Say it!
- You're a pretty princess.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.790
- Louder!
- You okay?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.334
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.212
Finally. Ling Mi One and Ling Mi Two.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.256
Who's sitting on my face first?

07:04.424 --> 07:08.677
Since that day,
I never went back to see my old man.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.644
While I was building a career,
I was looking for the man of my dreams.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.187
And I found him...

07:19.355 --> 07:23.358
the way all attention-seeking,
narcissist slut-bags do.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.118
Dana.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.619
Ha, ha.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.789
That's me. That's not you guys.

07:37.957 --> 07:42.210
Okay, here. Just hold that.
That's for you . Okay.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.299
Will you accept this rose?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.384
I would love to.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.058
Okay.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.563
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.107
Want this? Yeah, ride that donkey.
Yeah. Yeah.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.235
Yeah. Join in, dude. Join in. Come on.

08:07.778 --> 08:12.574
Aaron and I fell in love and got married
three months later.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.456
He had a beautiful 2-year-old daughter
named Liz.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.084
And a New York strip for you,
young lady. I forgot.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.339
It was just a matter of time before
I picked up the whole mothering thing.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.966
It's good. All right.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.428
Can't have a steak
without your steak knife.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.096
Good girl. Good girl.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.182
Yummy.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.227
Okay, eat up, ducky,
they're starving in Africa.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.483
Liz grew up so fast.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.904
She was your typical teenage daughter
with a few issues to work out.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.074
No, honey, now, don't. Don't...

08:55.952 --> 08:57.869
We had Jonah about a year ago.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.790
People say we're overprotective,
but I don't really see it.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.333
Our family was growing...

09:03.501 --> 09:06.628
so it was time to move out
of our cramped one-bedroom rental...

09:06.796 --> 09:09.798
that we shared
with the 12-member Rodriguez family.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.466
After an exhaustive search...

09:11.634 --> 09:14.928
I found that the house I grew up in
was available.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.515
This is amazing.
It's so peaceful here, honey.

09:18.683 --> 09:23.353
I know, sweetheart.
Another big milestone for the Galen family.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.022
Okay. Let's do this.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.568
Okay.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.361
Welcome to the new house, everyone.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.447
Well, this is my beautiful daughter
coming down our new stairs.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.326
There is my little man
with my favorite gal. Hello, sweetie.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.536
Okay.

09:41.163 --> 09:45.792
This house will work. I just
took the biggest dump upstairs.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.921
Felipe.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.466
Yes, missus?
It's time for Jonah's bath.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.803
No, no, no.
Sorry, not tonight, missus.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.931
Just kidding. Ha, ha, ha.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.059
Baby, come over here.
If I may propose a little toast?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.812
Very romantic. Well, thank you.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.523
To nothing but beautiful memories
in our new home.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.983
Babe.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.943
I love you. I love you.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.487
Cheers. Cheers.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.997
Make sure you record every moment.
This is gonna be riveting to watch.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.042
I just wanna document
our first full week in this house.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.251
I'll edit it later.

10:28.419 --> 10:32.172
It's all part of the master plan, babe.
I'm gonna do it at the same time.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.382
It's so...

10:35.718 --> 10:37.093
Text.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.555
Yes. What?

10:40.723 --> 10:41.848
I got the meeting.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.726
Honey, that's wonderful.
I know.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.811
They wanna schedule for next week.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.314
Baby, I'm so proud of you.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.943
This is a big deal, honey.
It's the Umbrella Corporation.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.405
If I get this, I won't have to consult
for anyone again.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.699
And you won't have to work
the corners anymore.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.452
Baby, you've worked so hard for this.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Thank you.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.708
Hey, you feel like
christening the new house?

11:08.876 --> 11:11.086
Well, the kids are asleep.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.255
You know how to turn me on.
Yeah? Wanna move some boxes, baby?

11:14.423 --> 11:17.759
The only box I'm interested in
is yours.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.688
Either one of you losers
might wanna take care of this.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.945
You should get out.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.906
Mommy and Daddy
are playing gardener.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.452
Order a pizza. Unh.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.787
Mushrooms?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.290
Green peppers and mushrooms.

11:51.836 --> 11:56.589
First full night in this house,
total awesomeness.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.217
Let me get this here.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.469
There we go.

12:06.142 --> 12:10.478
- What? What? What is this mess?
- Who tossed around all the furniture?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.981
Liz, what the hell happened here?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.859
Don't know. I was just about
to post my nudes on Twitter...

12:16.026 --> 12:18.862
and then I came in here
and saw this.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.534
Baby? Dana?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.788
What the hell?
Who redecorated the room?

12:28.956 --> 12:33.460
You know, it's actually pretty nice,
in a retro kind of way.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.838
Honey, it looks like Neil Patrick Harris
threw up in here.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.300
For chrissakes.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.931
My God.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.518
Wait. What?

12:50.686 --> 12:54.189
Dana doesn't know how to cook.
Where did all this food come from?

12:55.065 --> 12:59.027
Aaron, what the hell
is going on here?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.071
Yeah, Dad, this is fucking weird.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.532
But for some reason, I wanna shoot it.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.369
I don't know what this is either.
Could be your classic suburban burglar...

13:08.537 --> 13:10.413
or a practical joke
by Martha Stewart.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.874
You're wrong on both counts. Heh.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.710
It's just sweet old me, Paula Bean.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.798
I just wanted y'all to taste
my new low-fat recipe.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.770
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.150
You guys shooting a reality show
or something?

13:39.318 --> 13:42.153
No. No, that's my daughter Liz.
Hi, babe.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.822
Hey, sunshine.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.574
You like things that dangle?

13:46.742 --> 13:49.285
We're gonna saturate this space
with cameras.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.496
Okay? I'm gonna put one up
in that corner.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.667
Right? That way you get it coming this way. One
up in this corner, opposite direction. Boom.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.377
One from the dining room. Bam.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.088
Triangulation of coverage.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.882
Put one over the stove, right,
get it pointed this way.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.759
One on top of the TV,
pointed this way.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.136
That way we get the full coverage
in here, okay?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.055
All right, yeah. That's good.
Okay.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.432
I forgot
to put this on the list.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.476
You can install a camera
on this?

14:13.644 --> 14:16.271
No. To fuck on.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.107
Then I install a camera.
Ha-ha-ha!

14:19.275 --> 14:21.526
Okay, there's more house.
Let's go.

14:21.694 --> 14:26.281
We got one directly above the crib
and the one over here up the bunny's ass.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.700
Hey.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.243
This seems sturdy, right?

14:30.411 --> 14:35.164
Good for a nice blowing, right? You just
slide in between the slats and then...

14:35.332 --> 14:37.333
We'll get another one right here
coming in.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.880
We got this one pointed directly this way
and then one directly over the bed.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.133
Wait, why our bed?
Don't worry about it.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.303
Look at this fucking
great bathroom.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.972
Shit,
this is fucking beautiful.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.474
We're gonna stick one here
pointed at the bathtub.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.144
We got one high in this corner,
directed at the shower.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.396
And then one in the toilet.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.231
Excuse me?

16:17.768 --> 16:19.769
What are you doing
in my shower?

16:19.937 --> 16:23.564
Get out, out, out.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.447
Really?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.034
Sorry.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.495
These are my nieces.

17:00.269 --> 17:06.607
I love the pool heaters.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.654
Morning, honey.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.741
Somebody slept in this morning.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.160
I like sleeping.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.997
Especially when it's
sweet dreams about you.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.291
Hi. What is that?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.336
What?
There's writing on your face.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.839
Yeah, I do that every night.
It's good for the skin.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.468
What the hell is going on here?

18:16.804 --> 18:21.140
And this is exactly why we have cameras,
so we can get to the bottom of this stuff.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.018
What the...

18:24.186 --> 18:26.646
My God.
My God, honey, we have ghosts.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.441
Okay, okay. No, honey, it's okay. I think
you're being a little over dramatic.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.819
I'm sorry, really?
What would you call that?

18:32.986 --> 18:36.405
It could be a million different things.
Like what?

18:36.573 --> 18:40.743
Could be the air conditioning,
window was left open.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.120
Scientologists.

18:42.746 --> 18:46.999
No. I am sorry, honey, those are ghosts
and I am freaking out right now.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.460
Okay, Dana. Dana, look at me.
Calm down, okay?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.295
They're not ghosts.

18:51.463 --> 18:55.800
There is no such thing
as ghosts. Trust me.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.927
Okay, fine.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.054
Attention, all ghosts.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.307
If you're here with us right now
in this house...

19:03.475 --> 19:06.477
for the love of Jesus,
give us a sign.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.649
Okay. I guess you're right,
honey.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.239
Goddamn Scientologists.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.625
I just don't understand
why this is happening to us.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.878
I think I do.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.880
What?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.385
It all started when I was 7.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.263
I was getting drunk with my sister.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.850
We'd use tiny teacups,
that way our parents never knew.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.768
Don't put that there. Why?

19:47.936 --> 19:51.898
Because Jeremy's sitting there. Jillian,
you gotta stop with this ghost thing.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.191
You sound crazy.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.194
I'm not crazy,
I'm just telling you the truth.

19:58.947 --> 20:03.075
Sorry, Jillian, that one
was a little tougher to pinch off.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.452
Facial.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.662
Okay. Tea me up.

20:06.830 --> 20:11.250
But Jeremy Lin wasn't even a Knick back
then and I didn't know you had a sister.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.920
She was deported to Guatemala
when I was 10.

20:14.087 --> 20:18.090
But that's not the point.
The point is that two years after that...

20:18.258 --> 20:21.344
my father killed the entire cast
of The Artist...

20:21.511 --> 20:23.888
including Uggie the dog.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.766
Why? That was a great movie.

20:26.934 --> 20:30.311
Frankly, I don't understand
why the whole film had to be silent.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.520
But anyway...

20:31.688 --> 20:36.067
it wasn't until I was 20 years old that I
found out my father killed those people...

20:36.235 --> 20:37.485
during an exorcism.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.862
What?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.407
I know. It's crazy? Yeah.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.327
He's been in a psychiatric hospital
in ltaly ever since.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.665
Who's the person that walked you down
the aisle and comes over for the holidays?

20:50.832 --> 20:54.043
Sweetie. He's just an actor.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.837
His name's Joel Solomon.
He's very talented.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.465
I called him Pop-Pop.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.050
Listen, I...

21:01.218 --> 21:03.636
I really think we should call in
the Ghost Brothers.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.181
No way. Honey, those guys
are scam artists. You know that. No.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.517
Okay. Are you coming to bed?

21:10.894 --> 21:16.065
Not yet, I'm only halfway done with this,
honey. I need at least 45 more minutes.

22:00.485 --> 22:06.574
Babe, I've missed your touch.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.619
It's long since we...

22:15.709 --> 22:18.919
I know, it's all gone.
Let's get something to eat.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.921
Let's get some milk.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.383
What the...?

22:25.927 --> 22:29.805
I just bought two containers of milk.
Who drank it all?

22:32.100 --> 22:34.769
Hello, we are the Ghost Brothers,
here to investigate.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.233
It is so thick in here, dude.
So many ghosts in the air!

22:41.401 --> 22:44.528
I know what you mean.
It's like we're breathing in ghosts.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.781
Dude, I am choking
on a ghost right now.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.241
- I am choking on a ghost.
- Spit that ghost out.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.912
Spit that ghost out right now.
Spit it out! I'll punch it out if you want!

22:53.080 --> 22:54.372
Guys!

22:54.539 --> 22:56.957
You guys are professionals, right?

22:57.125 --> 23:00.252
Yeah, 100 percent.
We even have business cards.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.214
Call me the middle man.
There you go. Super legit.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.758
Call us because we're always open. Daily.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.844
Did you hear that?
That TV just turned on!

23:09.012 --> 23:11.222
We're gonna die.
Here we go, let's go.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.766
Rack them up, dude.
This is what we've been training for.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.144
I turned it on.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.398
She turned it on. So...

23:20.982 --> 23:23.651
She's possessed by ghosts!
She's possessed by ghosts!

23:29.449 --> 23:31.951
My Lord! I am a...

23:32.953 --> 23:35.830
My God.
These ghost readings are off the charts.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.457
Dude, there are 57 ghosts
in that bathroom over there.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.043
What?
Three in my pee stream. Off the record.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.003
Where are you getting
these numbers from?

23:44.464 --> 23:46.173
A ghost was just born
in my hand.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.843
What do we do?
Flamboyant scream?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.010
Duh.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.139
Stop it! Stop!

23:53.306 --> 23:57.601
My God! My God! My God!

23:57.769 --> 23:58.769
Ooh.

23:59.187 --> 24:02.773
Seriously? This is what you
brought into our house?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.818
All right, so we found about 70 ghosts
in your house total.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.736
Fifty-five up there
in your bedroom.

24:07.904 --> 24:11.323
Also, it's our day off,
so we charge double for that.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.618
So, whatever you guys think is fair.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.912
So, basically, free?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.499
I was thinking moreover, like, $3.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.668
Fine, deal. Go.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.337
Thank you so much. Hell, yeah.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.382
If you need us, we will be in our van,
watching the perimeters.

25:27.901 --> 25:32.112
A door doesn't wake you? You deaf?
I knew I had to step up my game...

25:32.280 --> 25:34.698
or I'd get kicked out of the house.

25:43.166 --> 25:47.253
I love the pool cleaners.
I love the pool cleaners.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.673
I love the pool cleaners.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.389
Do the left nut.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.391
Left nut.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.977
My hair.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.744
There's something about the way
You do your thing

26:26.001 --> 26:28.586
I can't take my eyes off you.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.221
- Liz, you have a visitor.
- What the...?

26:44.352 --> 26:45.811
Good morning, young lady.

26:45.979 --> 26:52.526
Hey. I was just looking for my earring.
There it is.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.821
Who said you could come to my room?

26:55.989 --> 27:00.075
Well, I apologize for barging in.
Your mother gave me permission.

27:00.243 --> 27:03.287
Well, what if I didn't want you
to come up?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.373
I had a sneaking suspicion...

27:06.916 --> 27:09.543
you did. And how's that?

27:10.337 --> 27:14.256
By the very way you were staring at me.

27:14.424 --> 27:19.219
Say what? I wasn't staring at you, dude.
I was writing in my journal.

27:27.020 --> 27:30.564
Look, I don't know what you want,
but I'm really busy.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.359
I was just about to pierce my pancreas.

27:35.236 --> 27:40.532
I just came to say hello.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.578
Hello Hello.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.622
Come to Abe.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.252
Shit-burger.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.421
What?

27:54.589 --> 27:58.425
Gotta go, babe. Getting the
hairy eyeball from my sweet slut.

27:58.968 --> 28:00.928
Yeah. Check you later, though.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.222
Can't wait to get inside
that oval office.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Stay free.

28:08.311 --> 28:12.272
But wait! I didn't even get to show you
my Apple product placement!

28:20.031 --> 28:21.448
Is this thing on?

28:21.616 --> 28:24.034
Hello, America! Hello, America!

28:24.202 --> 28:28.288
All right, we came here expecting to find
a bunch of ghosts and guess what?

28:28.456 --> 28:30.541
We did.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.001
I didn't say any of that just now.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.295
You're possessed.
Dude, kill me.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.885
I'm trying, but I can't. Why?

28:42.053 --> 28:44.805
Because I'm possessed too.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.975
We're both possessed by ghosts!
We're both possessed by ghosts!

28:54.941 --> 28:57.234
Ooh! Gotta go.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.987
Call you tomorrow. Goodbye.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.824
Yes, Miss Liz?

29:03.992 --> 29:06.910
I thought maybe we could talk.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.455
Come on in. Come on.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.415
Sit down.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.376
Don't worry about that.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.546
Felipe was just tanning.
Just some tanning.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.089
There you go, sit down.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.350
Heh, heh.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.520
Don't worry, they don't bite.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.898
Ay-ay-ay. Ahem.

29:36.149 --> 29:39.485
So, what can I help you with?

29:39.652 --> 29:41.320
It's about a boy.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.781
Of course it is.

29:43.948 --> 29:48.702
His name is Abraham and I just don't know
if I've already blown it with him.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.707
I really like him.
I think about him all the time.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.760
There are certain things you can do to...
How you say?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.094
To win him over.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.387
Like what?

30:08.306 --> 30:11.517
It's called "Roofie and Bang."

30:11.684 --> 30:14.686
A "Roofie and Bang"?

30:17.398 --> 30:22.653
Just put one of those in his Amaretto Sours
and he's yours for the rest of the night.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.531
And the best thing is that they wake up
the next morning...

30:25.698 --> 30:28.617
not knowing I stuck my cheese
between their crackers.

30:28.785 --> 30:33.622
Ha, ha! It's fabulous. Have fun.
Heh, heh.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.437
No.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.282
Poor little baby.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.369
Are you hungry?
Are you hungry, baby Jonah?

33:17.537 --> 33:22.666
Come here. Just kidding.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.920
What a good boy. Yeah.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.672
Shh!

34:33.529 --> 34:35.947
Help me! Aah!

34:51.714 --> 34:53.547
Unh!

35:17.990 --> 35:21.368
Jesus Christ.
Dude, are you okay?

35:25.039 --> 35:27.499
What the hell is this doing here?

35:27.667 --> 35:30.377
I gotta know,
who the hells are you? You?

35:30.545 --> 35:32.504
I'm directing. We're...

35:32.672 --> 35:35.924
Leave me alone!

36:04.745 --> 36:06.454
Sweet Lord.

36:06.622 --> 36:10.333
My God.

36:10.501 --> 36:14.421
No. No. No, no, no.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.218
Thank God.

36:20.386 --> 36:24.514
If that thing had been left out another hour,
we would've had ourselves a murky pool.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.766
Hey, Felipe.

38:02.863 --> 38:05.448
Bam! Dutch oven, bitch.

38:48.534 --> 38:49.701
Aw, baby.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.371
Thank you, honey.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.753
Your nose is cold.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.547
Baby, the eggroll.

39:02.715 --> 39:05.175
Teeth, teeth, teeth.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.719
You need a haircut.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.574
There's so much...
Get it off me. Get it off me.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.831
Good morning, sweetheart.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.501
Hi. Hi.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.462
You know, I gotta tell you...

39:42.630 --> 39:45.715
that was a really nice surprise
you gave me last night.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.718
I'm telling you, baby...

39:48.886 --> 39:53.098
it's moments like those
that make this marriage so exciting.

40:00.022 --> 40:03.191
What? This...

40:12.034 --> 40:13.201
You want to mess with me?

40:13.369 --> 40:17.122
You've messed with the wrong person,
jerk-off.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.165
Aaron, what are you doing?

40:19.333 --> 40:23.461
Dana, they have crossed the line
and I am not taking their crap anymore.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.046
Sweetheart, please.

40:25.214 --> 40:30.009
I think if we just lay low
and we don't interact, they'll go away.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.762
Yeah.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.557
Okay.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.308
Okay, fine. Okay. All right.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.352
I'm giving it one week. That's it.
Okay.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.562
Got it? Yes.

40:40.729 --> 40:43.731
I've got a big interview
and I am not gonna have it screwed up...

40:43.899 --> 40:46.276
by a bunch of ghosts.
I understa...

40:46.444 --> 40:50.655
Sweetie, we have to go. We have to run
those illegals across the border.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.866
My God. Is it noon already?
Baby, yeah.

40:53.033 --> 40:56.369
Go, go.
Illegals don't keep in the heat, sweetie.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.921
He maintains a strict plant-based diet.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.934
Beat an egg white.
I made it faster than the machine.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.185
Over the counter. One.

42:02.353 --> 42:06.898
Yes. One, two, three, go.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.601
Yeah, baby.

42:44.937 --> 42:48.314
That's right. That's it. It feels...
Feels so good.

42:48.482 --> 42:50.817
So smooth. You're a dirty little one.

42:50.985 --> 42:54.362
You're a dirty little minx. You...

42:54.738 --> 42:56.364
Look at it. Look at it.

43:02.162 --> 43:04.706
And you thought we couldn't fit
20 of them into one van.

43:04.873 --> 43:09.377
Well, once again, honey, you were right.
Thank you, sweetie.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.342
- Honey, do you smell something burning?
- No.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.721
Something's burning.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.895
Ew.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.733
Ectoplasm.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.036
Son of a bitch!

43:45.539 --> 43:47.457
Aaron, you're wasting all of it.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.335
Don't worry, honey.
It's only the cheap stuff from Tijuana.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.920
I just don't get what this is gonna prove.

43:53.088 --> 43:56.215
It's gonna prove
that we're not going out of our minds.

43:56.383 --> 43:59.010
If anyone or anything
is coming into this room...

43:59.178 --> 44:03.014
we'll have a clear idea
of what we are dealing with.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.977
Whoo!

44:35.756 --> 44:37.382
What was that?

44:37.841 --> 44:40.176
Holy sweet nuts.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.016
Sweet potato pancakes,
would you look at that?

44:47.184 --> 44:48.643
It's scary.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.145
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

44:51.313 --> 44:52.730
So scary. Don't get too...

44:52.898 --> 44:54.732
Look.

44:54.900 --> 44:59.529
Honey, he's just a witty-bitty thing.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.323
It's so cute.

45:03.325 --> 45:05.201
No. I knew it, honey. He's a baller.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.954
No. It's okay.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.206
You know what they say about big feet.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.584
Don't worry, baby. Don't wo...

45:13.752 --> 45:15.002
They end here.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.713
This is weird.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.756
My God. Did you leave that open?

45:18.924 --> 45:21.300
What, the...?

45:21.760 --> 45:22.969
No.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.054
We are so fucked.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.112
I'm the raccoon that snuck into your attic.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.447
Scratchy, scratchy.

45:42.614 --> 45:45.658
Now your power bill's through the roof.
Whoo!

45:45.826 --> 45:48.411
If you got home insurance
where you got car insurance...

45:48.579 --> 45:51.164
then you're gonna have to pay
for this by yourself.

45:51.331 --> 45:55.418
So get Upstate. You'll save money
and be better protected from mayhem...

45:55.586 --> 45:57.253
like me.

46:01.133 --> 46:04.093
Okay, ducky, so you wanna
give him his baba in half an hour...

46:04.261 --> 46:06.888
and give him the soy formula
because he's had a lot...

46:07.055 --> 46:09.932
Bitch, I got it covered.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.810
Get the hell out.
Okay. Bye, now, sweetie.

46:12.978 --> 46:16.230
Okay. Okay.
And we're shoving now.

46:16.398 --> 46:17.857
That's good.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.070
He's okay. He'll walk it off. Just go.

46:23.238 --> 46:26.073
I got you. It's okay.
Bye, buddy.

46:28.035 --> 46:31.537
You smell like a dumpster. Yeah.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.099
Shh.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.060
My bad.

47:03.278 --> 47:06.113
Dude, seriously.

47:07.115 --> 47:09.242
Dude, they dropped me all the time.

47:09.409 --> 47:11.410
Look how good I turned out.

47:29.763 --> 47:33.766
The Tasmanian monkey is not one
to shy away from a good ass-humping.

47:33.934 --> 47:37.135
With its muscular hind legs and powerful
thrusts that can pull a 1 -ton truck...

47:38.689 --> 47:40.898
this rare species is...

47:47.114 --> 47:50.157
Sorry to barge in.
I just locked myself out of the house.

47:50.325 --> 47:53.160
Can I use your phone? Yeah.

48:00.794 --> 48:03.045
You mind if I take my pants off?

48:03.964 --> 48:06.841
No.

48:07.467 --> 48:11.387
You mind if I deep French kiss you
while I fondle your 12-year-old boy ass?

48:12.264 --> 48:13.556
Okay.

48:22.190 --> 48:23.524
My name is Alice...

48:23.692 --> 48:25.818
and this is my world.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.964
Shit! You guys gotta get out of here.

48:47.132 --> 48:48.507
But we just got started.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.218
I don't care! Get out! Okay!

48:55.515 --> 48:57.892
Guess we'll just have to do each other.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.311
Leave.

49:03.065 --> 49:05.358
Well, hello...

49:05.525 --> 49:10.363
Maybe your friends would care to stay
for a libation?

49:10.530 --> 49:12.073
Or two.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.951
No.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.370
Baby.

49:19.998 --> 49:22.208
You and I belong together.

49:22.918 --> 49:24.585
You know...

49:24.753 --> 49:30.633
I greatly apologize
for intruding upon your privacy.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.552
Not at all . Sit down.

49:34.429 --> 49:37.056
Can I get you something to drink?

49:37.224 --> 49:39.225
Amaretto Sour?

49:39.393 --> 49:42.186
No, I don't think that'll be nece...
Why, thank you.

49:42.354 --> 49:44.730
Is that John Wilkes Booth?
Where?

49:45.691 --> 49:47.900
My mistake. I hate that guy.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.402
Me too.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.529
Anyways...

49:51.697 --> 49:52.780
I'm glad you're here.

49:53.573 --> 49:54.824
As am I.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.701
You look thirsty.

49:57.786 --> 49:59.745
Drink, drink, drink.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.415
All the way.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.126
Good boy.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.629
Come to Abe.

50:10.132 --> 50:11.173
Yeah.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.554
I'm Abe Lincoln.

50:18.056 --> 50:20.266
Wow, you know,
I am feeling a little sleepy.

50:20.434 --> 50:21.600
Don't fight it.

50:21.768 --> 50:25.563
Show me the Lincoln Monument.
Yeah, I want you to go to the South.

50:25.731 --> 50:26.981
Yeah, take me to the South.

50:27.149 --> 50:30.443
You wanna see the Lincoln Monument?
Show it to me.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.536
Sorry, bitch. He's mine.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.079
What in tarnation?

50:42.247 --> 50:45.041
You're in good hands now, papi.

50:45.208 --> 50:49.754
Felipe was the one who created
the Roofie and Bang.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.465
Hey! Let me out!

50:53.258 --> 50:56.635
I want to free your penis slaves.

51:02.601 --> 51:04.268
Rats!

51:05.020 --> 51:07.396
Your nipples...

51:07.564 --> 51:10.191
they taste like copper pennies.

51:17.783 --> 51:20.868
I'd like to invite you to the Teabag Party.

51:24.915 --> 51:25.956
Abraham?

51:26.792 --> 51:27.875
Abraham!

51:28.043 --> 51:31.504
Help me! Help me! Help me!

51:32.672 --> 51:35.341
Abe Lincoln's getting teabagged!

51:39.805 --> 51:40.846
No, stop it!

51:43.517 --> 51:45.226
Take this, you dragon tattooed slut!

52:03.870 --> 52:04.414
Abraham.

52:14.923 --> 52:16.799
Abraham?

52:18.593 --> 52:20.136
Abraham.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.221
Abraham!

52:24.766 --> 52:30.020
Let me in!

53:22.240 --> 53:25.743
Mom, Dad, it's me, Jonah.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.995
Where do I start?

53:28.163 --> 53:30.331
It was just supposed to be for one night.

53:30.498 --> 53:31.916
I wanted to be cool, you know?

53:32.083 --> 53:36.170
I wanted to be more than just a baby
in the crib.

53:36.338 --> 53:39.256
And then things got a
little out of control.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.356
Excuse me! Excuse me, please!

53:55.523 --> 53:58.317
You're all gonna have to shut this down...

53:58.485 --> 54:00.778
or I'm gonna have to call the cops.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.879
It's about time we had a proper date night.

54:19.047 --> 54:20.923
Well, it was a wonderful night.
Yeah.

54:21.091 --> 54:25.594
I'll tell you what I am excited about.
Having a chocolate muffin for dessert.

54:25.762 --> 54:28.138
That is for tomorrow, young man.

54:28.974 --> 54:32.726
Wow. Honey, there's no mess.

54:32.894 --> 54:34.019
I'm so impressed.

54:34.187 --> 54:37.189
I told you, Liz is responsible
to handle all of this.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.900
You know, once again you were right.
Thank you, dear.

54:44.197 --> 54:45.781
Shh, shh.

54:47.575 --> 54:50.286
Hey, Jonah.

54:53.915 --> 54:55.916
Is that a wine cooler?

55:12.225 --> 55:15.352
Ooh! Look at that.
Honey Badger don't give a shit.

55:15.520 --> 55:19.898
He'll just run through your bedroom while
you're sleeping. Honey Badger don't care.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.208
It's not even fun anymore.

55:45.884 --> 55:46.967
Honey?

55:47.135 --> 55:50.179
Honey, wake up.
I already gave you a handgie.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.222
Did you hear that?

55:52.390 --> 55:54.516
Something downstairs.

55:59.731 --> 56:02.274
No, no, no.

56:03.943 --> 56:05.944
Damn it, no.

56:12.744 --> 56:14.203
My God.

56:14.371 --> 56:15.996
No!

56:16.164 --> 56:17.581
Sweetie!

56:18.249 --> 56:21.168
Damn it. What is it?

56:21.336 --> 56:24.129
Someone ate
my chocolate muffin.

56:24.297 --> 56:25.339
Yeah.

56:27.592 --> 56:29.134
Babe?

56:31.846 --> 56:33.764
My God.

56:37.143 --> 56:40.020
That's seven years bad luck.
I know.

56:45.944 --> 56:48.654
They swapped out all the family photos.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.156
I gotta document this.

56:53.159 --> 56:54.660
Honey?

56:56.496 --> 56:58.372
Something's breathing on me.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.750
And it smells like chocolate muffin.

57:01.918 --> 57:03.168
Wow.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.922
A lot of them look like they're
from the turn of the century.

57:07.715 --> 57:09.091
And now it's feeling me up.

57:11.344 --> 57:13.470
Ooh.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.348
Who's a naughty ghost?
Wow, baby, you gotta look at this.

57:16.516 --> 57:20.978
The ghost's great grandfather's ghost
is in a picture with President Roosevelt.

57:21.146 --> 57:24.481
Yeah, you're a bad ghost!
Do it to me like it's paranormal!

57:24.649 --> 57:27.025
- Looks like Hitler's ghost is here.
- Yeah.

57:27.193 --> 57:29.862
Yeah! Yeah, fuck me
like you don't know me!

57:30.029 --> 57:31.822
God, you're such a big ghost!

57:31.990 --> 57:35.033
- God, I love poltergeists! Yeah!
- Right, right, right.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.209
Okay.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.628
Whoa!

57:46.838 --> 57:49.173
Close the door!
Close the door! Close it!

57:49.340 --> 57:50.716
Sorry.

57:54.429 --> 57:57.973
Hello. Hi. Come on in. Hi.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.601
- We weren't expecting visitors.
- No, that's okay.

58:00.768 --> 58:03.520
- It's small, but we get by.
- Didn't mean to intrude.

58:03.688 --> 58:05.981
- Sit down, welcome to our humble abode.
- Welcome.

58:06.149 --> 58:07.232
We know it's not much.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.236
Hey, what you guys saw back there,
totally nothing.

58:11.404 --> 58:13.572
Hey, guys, we're not here to judge.
Yeah, no.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.908
- That was actually science, okay?
- Yeah.

58:16.075 --> 58:20.579
We can't really get into it because it's...
Guys, it's fine. It's fine. Listen.

58:20.747 --> 58:23.582
Things are getting worse
at the house.

58:23.750 --> 58:27.794
Um, hey, why are you filming all of this?

58:28.796 --> 58:30.923
I just feel the need
to record everything.

58:31.090 --> 58:32.758
Good call.
Yeah, good call, my man.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.510
We actually do the same thing.

58:34.677 --> 58:36.011
Camera twins. Let's go.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.554
Okay, look, guys... Okay.

58:37.722 --> 58:39.973
We really, really need your help.

58:40.141 --> 58:42.059
All right. Step number one.

58:42.227 --> 58:45.646
You gotta hire yourself
a Hispanic gay manny, all right?

58:45.813 --> 58:48.273
But he's not gonna do
any of his chores.

58:48.441 --> 58:51.485
- Instead, this is the kicker.
- Here's the kicker. I love this part.

58:51.653 --> 58:55.280
This is great. He's gonna be up in his room
all day with some secret lover...

58:55.448 --> 58:58.450
that nobody really knows
or understands at all.

58:58.618 --> 59:01.370
I'm sorry. Are you frigging kidding me?

59:02.455 --> 59:04.164
What Effing?

59:04.332 --> 59:06.917
You've just described
our manny Felipe.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.460
Great. Awesome. All right.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.587
I'll check that one off. Moving on.
Cool.

59:10.755 --> 59:12.464
All right, here we go. Number two.

59:12.632 --> 59:16.593
You're gonna have to do a very bad job
at raising a teenage girl, okay?

59:16.761 --> 59:19.471
That way she can have a very rebellious
phase in her teens.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.640
I'm talking tattoos.
I'm talking piercings.

59:21.808 --> 59:24.685
I'm talking things to do with dragons.
You get my drift?

59:26.771 --> 59:29.815
You guys...? Okay.
Great. You guys already have that.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.234
Here's number three.
Aaron, this is just for you.

59:32.402 --> 59:35.404
All you gotta do is stumble upon
two naked dudes in their van.

59:35.572 --> 59:38.949
That's it. That's all there is to it.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.691
Aaron! Aaron!

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.152
No, no! Aah!

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.446
Aaron!

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:19.740
No.

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:58.528
Fuck. I forgot the crisps.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:10.666
Good morning.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.462
How long have you been up?
Honey?

01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:18.882
You okay? Hello?

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.593
Dana?

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:25.389
Dana. Honey, talk to me. What are you...?

01:01:32.313 --> 01:01:33.730
Holy mother of cotton.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:38.652
Dana. Baby? Baby. Say some...

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.490
"Get out of my house...

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.451
buttnuts"?

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:52.332
Hello?

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:55.085
Hello, sir.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.504
You wanna come here?

01:01:57.672 --> 01:02:01.591
No, no. That's fantastic, sir.
My house is your house.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.260
Bye-bye.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.931
Dana, that was the CEO
of the Umbrella Corporation.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:11.810
He's coming here. Isn't that great? Wha...?

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.311
Right.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:18.191
I've gotta figure out how to get
you depossessed before he gets here.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.823
But since you're unconscious anyway...
No.

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:26.408
Okay.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:47.804
Sluggy?

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.516
Sluggy Kornnutz, exorcism specialist.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:09.034
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
and all of his saviors...

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.661
I command you, evict this body...

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:16.833
and return back to the bowels of hell
from whence you came.

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:20.295
Defiant one.

01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:23.632
They hate this.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.230
What? What? What? What's going on?

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:42.901
She's being possessed by the
her inner demons.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.737
We all have them.
We try to fight them on a daily basis...

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:49.074
whether it's eating the last half-pint
of strawberry ice cream...

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.076
or shooting up an armful of smack...

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:54.037
Sluggy. Please.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.581
Sorry.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.543
Time to bring out the big guns.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.671
What are you doing?
An intervention.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.423
Stop, stop. Stop it.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:09.344
What? What's wrong?
You're not shooting my wife.

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:16.726
Suit yourself.
We'll stick with the chosen plan.

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:08.361
I'm okay. I'm back.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:13.241
Mazel tov Mazel tov!

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:30.425
You've got 20 minutes
to knock my socks off.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:34.888
But first, I need your bathroom.
I just sharted myself.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:51.279
Very impressed.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.450
You've got everything covered.
Thank you.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.161
What do you know about umbrellas?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.497
I'm sorry?

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:04.709
What do you know about umbrellas?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.881
You...

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.011
use them when it rains?

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.681
Aaron...

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.934
you're hired.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:24.354
My God.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:29.275
All right. Hi.
My God. Hey. Thanks, guys.

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:33.405
All right, enough.
Listen, I need to use your bathroom again.

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:37.534
This time, not only did I shart,
but I peed myself too.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.744
Of course...

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:46.459
You didn't pay your electric bill?
That's a loser move.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:48.628
Winners pay their bills.

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:52.757
No, no, no, I pay my bills. All the time.
I'm a winner. Ask anybody.

01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:56.386
There's a short. There's a short
in the breaker. It happens all the time.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.554
I know that you've got a plane to catch,
so why don't we just go out and...?

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.771
Thank you, honey.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:12.193
I've done some messed-up shit
in my life...

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:15.321
but that is insanity.

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:17.782
Aaron, you're fired.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:22.454
What...? Wait, wait, no, no, no.
I can explain. I can explain.

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:25.498
Wait, sir. Sir. Right over here.
Look. Look in the closet. See?

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:27.125
We've got three umbrell... Look.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:30.670
Look, one of the umbrellas is already open
in case it rains in the house.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.799
Sir, just give me one more chance, please.
I'm gonna borrow your dog for a few days.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.760
I don't know if... Fantastic.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.304
Baby.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.599
There's something about the way
You do your thing.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:46.561
Generic? Loser.

01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.483
Damn it.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.902
Damn it! Shit!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.114
Yes. Now, that felt good. Bloody good.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.159
So you think that's funny?

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.704
Why don't you come out
and show yourself, you son of a bitch?

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:06.748
You're so stupid. Ha, ha, ha.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:10.126
Yeah, sure, it's easy to haunt people
when you're invisible.

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:13.671
Come out here, you wuss.
I'm a ghost.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.389
- Holy shit.
- Calm down.

01:08:23.557 --> 01:08:27.185
Now is not the time for fear.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.020
That comes later. Ha, ha, ha.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:31.981
What?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:36.027
I said, calm down.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:40.573
Now is not the time for fear.
That comes later.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.202
I'm sorry, I'm not getting it.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.790
You dumb-ass.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.584
I said, calm down.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.837
Now is not the time for fear.

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:56.171
That comes later.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.634
Okay. No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.136
Shit. God.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.234
What on earth is going on
down there?

01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:21.865
Honey, hi.
You think you could give me a hand?

01:09:25.618 --> 01:09:29.831
Why is Manuel
the Guatemalan gardener shirtless?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.127
All right. I got you now.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.630
Been waiting a long time.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.846
This is some good shit.
The best.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.433
Buttery, isn't it? Amazing.

01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:56.649
That's my cock.

01:09:57.776 --> 01:10:00.195
You'd think it would be circumcised.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.912
This is the scary part.

01:10:11.832 --> 01:10:13.917
Ha, ha, ha.
What the hell is going on?

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:19.797
Welcome! Welcome to
the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:24.052
May the odds be ever in your favor.
Ha, ha, ha.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.805
For the love of God, please have mercy!

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:31.893
I don't want my ass
to be branded!

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.128
My God. Honey.

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:00.797
It's the Ghost Brothers.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:04.592
Take that, douche bags!
Take that, douche bags!

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.010
You saved our lives.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.097
Thank you so much.

01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:23.111
Yeah,
we're getting out of here.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:30.076
No. No, dude.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.040
Abe Lincoln, bro.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:39.419
Hey, hey, hey, Abraham Lincoln!
Ho-ho-ho.

01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:42.630
What are you doing?
Killing ghost hunters.

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.299
But you're a vampire slayer.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.552
Yeah, well, getting tea-bagged by a ghost
changes a man.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.014
My God!

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:55.518
No, no, no! Please, don't! Don't!

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:57.312
Die, you son of a bitch.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.063
Die!

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.483
Abe Lincoln's getting Tased.

01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:05.570
Leave my dad alone, bitch.

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:08.948
Liz? Honey.

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:11.075
Honey, you look great.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:12.744
What happened to you?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:18.666
Guys, I'm so sorry for being the rebellious,
skanky, slutty teenager for so long.

01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:23.379
You two deserve better than that.
You've been the most amazing parents...

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:25.173
and I love you both so much.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.175
- Honey. We love you.
- We love you.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.261
That's an ax.
That's an ax in my arm.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.847
There is one more bit of exciting news.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.224
You got off the meth?
Your herpes cleared up?

01:12:35.392 --> 01:12:37.143
You're not a lesbian anymore?
No.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.479
I met the most amazing guy...

01:12:39.646 --> 01:12:43.608
and he's brought so much positivity
to my life on so many levels.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:47.528
Mom and Dad,
meet my new boyfriend Otto.

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:53.034
Isn't he the sweetest?

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.705
Does Otto have a five-year plan?

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:01.042
He's Jewish.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.545
I love Jews.
That's a good plan. I like it.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:22.271
I stood face to face
and fought off an attack...

01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:25.108
and I know that you
want all of the facts.

01:13:25.275 --> 01:13:29.153
So stick a fin in your ear
and dig out the wax!

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.832
Felipe!

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.084
I'm just kidding!

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.879
The cameras they had taped
and the mouse was afraid...

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.382
that his ass would get laid.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.677
If my ass would get laid!

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.060
- Hey, gang!
- Dad?

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:02.645
I know, I know.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:06.649
Yeah, I got kicked out of the hospital
for lewd misconduct, whatever that means.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.276
So I thought I'd stay with you.

01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:12.530
No, we don't have the...
Cool. Come in, ladies. We got company.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.782
Awesome. Discount whores.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.325
The best.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.828
This is...

01:14:19.371 --> 01:14:20.621
Bah!

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:25.460
Okay, well, if you need me, I will be
upstairs doing the Jamaican Donut.

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:29.005
Yeah. It's like yoga,
except it's stinky.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:32.758
Then we'll do a Pittsburgh Platter,
Cleveland Steamer. We'll mix it up.

01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:36.345
- So that was your real father?
- Yeah.

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:38.639
I like him.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.433
I like him a lot.

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:47.899
Are you effing kidding me? This is the
biggest piece of crap video I've ever seen.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:50.234
I know.
We aren't getting squat for it.

01:14:50.402 --> 01:14:51.903
I don't know.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:56.324
Well, I thought it was pretty damn good.

01:14:56.783 --> 01:15:00.119
Could one of you be a dove
and get me another tub of popcorn?

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:03.539
Extra butter, please,
with a splash of patchouli oil?

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:01.384
I like the taste of honey.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.762
This ain't from a honey bee

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:08.849
I like the sea and sunshine

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.936
I like to feel I'm free

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:34.291
I like the icy water
I like to feel I'm tall

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:38.462
I like your lips on my lips

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.465
I'll catch you when you fall

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.093
I like it that way.

01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:47.596
Yes, I like it that way

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:51.308
I like it that way.

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:54.854
Yes, I like it that way

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:15.291
I like the color purple.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:19.295
It makes my world go round

01:19:19.504 --> 01:19:26.010
I like the shady palm tree
When I lay on the ground

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:28.095
I like it that way.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.682
Yes, I like it that way

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.603
I like it that way.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:39.315
Yes, I like it that way

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:45.654
I like it that way.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.241
Yes, I like it that way

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:52.953
I like it that way.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:55.498
