WEBVTT

00:03.869 --> 00:05.521
Sweetheart, look,

00:05.565 --> 00:07.739
I meant to come home last night,
all right?

00:07.782 --> 00:09.217
[sighs]

00:09.260 --> 00:12.347
Yeah, my class ran late,
and I had all those papers...

00:12.391 --> 00:14.086
What are you accusing me of?

00:15.652 --> 00:17.739
Look, I can't deal with this
right now.

00:17.782 --> 00:19.913
I got to go.
I'll call you later.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.130
[phone beeps off]

00:22.173 --> 00:23.391
[groans]

00:23.434 --> 00:24.956
[grunts]

00:28.347 --> 00:29.739
[sighs]

00:29.782 --> 00:32.000
[keypad beeping]

00:32.043 --> 00:34.000
[quietly]:
Come on.

00:36.391 --> 00:38.391
Hey, it's me.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.826
I'm starting
to really lose it here.

00:42.869 --> 00:44.826
I can't keep lying to my wife.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.869
It's killing me.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.521
We need to end this.

00:50.565 --> 00:51.913
Can we meet?

00:51.956 --> 00:54.130
I'm at the park across
from the Hayes Hotel.

00:54.173 --> 00:56.173
I'll see you soon.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.260
[phone beeps off]

01:02.347 --> 01:04.304
[sighs]

01:05.565 --> 01:07.739
[grunts]

01:40.695 --> 01:43.652
Yes, I know, I got it.
For the 188th time, I got it.

01:43.695 --> 01:45.913
Yes. The balloons,
and the streamers.

01:45.956 --> 01:48.739
I know, I know.
What? No, no, no.

01:48.782 --> 01:49.826
No strippers this year.

01:49.869 --> 01:50.956
No!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.434
[backpack thuds on desk]

01:52.478 --> 01:54.608
I got to go. I'll call you back.

01:54.652 --> 01:56.043
Planning a party, Tony?

01:56.086 --> 01:58.043
Not exactly.

01:58.086 --> 01:59.739
It's my father's birthday.

01:59.782 --> 02:01.695
He's planning, I'm paying.

02:01.739 --> 02:02.913
In all kinds of ways.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.304
Well, sounds like
he's really into it.

02:04.347 --> 02:06.521
[wry chuckling]:
Oh, yeah, he's into it.

02:06.565 --> 02:08.652
Like a little
sorority girl.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.086
[in high-pitched voice]:
It's my birthday.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.217
My birthday?
Not even a present.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.695
Makes my head hurt.

02:13.739 --> 02:15.826
At least your dad
gets in the spirit.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.043
Mine hates birthdays.

02:17.086 --> 02:18.217
ZIVA:
My father attended

02:18.260 --> 02:19.608
every birthday party.

02:19.652 --> 02:21.043
But his mind was always
elsewhere.

02:21.086 --> 02:25.130
Yeah, I remember one year--
I think I was seven--

02:25.173 --> 02:27.347
I spent all day making
this huge card for my dad.

02:27.391 --> 02:30.086
Used paint, glitter,
special paper, the works.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.000
I gave it to him that night,

02:32.043 --> 02:34.478
and, uh, he handed it
back to me, and said,

02:34.521 --> 02:35.956
"You can do better. Try again."

02:38.739 --> 02:40.608
That is a terrible story, McGee.

02:40.652 --> 02:42.608
Eh, it's just the way he is.

02:42.652 --> 02:44.391
TONY: Yeah, but
McGee's old man

02:44.434 --> 02:46.000
is a legend, right?

02:46.043 --> 02:47.478
Called him the
Great Santini.

02:47.521 --> 02:49.347
ZIVA: Wait a minute.
He's a magician?

02:49.391 --> 02:51.086
I thought he was a Navy admiral.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.826
The movie, Ziva--
The Great Santini,

02:53.869 --> 02:56.086
starring the great
Robert Duvall who played

02:56.130 --> 02:59.913
the ruthless military pilot
and brutal family man

02:59.956 --> 03:02.043
Bull Meechum.
Please don't.

03:02.086 --> 03:03.869
TONY [imitating Duvall]:
There's those that's got 'em,

03:03.913 --> 03:05.695
and those that don't.

03:05.739 --> 03:07.043
Gonads, son!

03:07.086 --> 03:08.391
Big brass ones!

03:08.434 --> 03:09.826
And there it is.

03:09.869 --> 03:11.130
Kind of makes
sense that

03:11.173 --> 03:13.043
you'd end up working
for Gibbs, McMeechum.

03:13.086 --> 03:14.521
There are similarities.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.521
He's got big, brass ones.

03:16.565 --> 03:18.217
They're like bowling balls.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.260
That is disgusting.

03:19.304 --> 03:20.695
I'm talking about

03:20.739 --> 03:22.086
tough love tactics, Tony.

03:22.130 --> 03:23.869
The veneer of
impenetrability.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.695
His skill at turning one
word into a rallying cry.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.260
Gear up.

03:28.304 --> 03:30.130
Guess that's two
words, isn't it?

03:30.173 --> 03:31.478
Something funny,
DiNozzo?

03:31.521 --> 03:33.304
No, boss.
Grabbing my gear.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.086
Got a dead Navy officer
downtown.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.130
Nothing funny about that.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.695
[camera shutter clicking]

03:39.739 --> 03:42.347
[siren blaring]

03:42.391 --> 03:43.826
Ambushed from behind, boss?

03:43.869 --> 03:45.695
Maybe. How many shots, Duck?

03:45.739 --> 03:47.043
Just one

03:47.086 --> 03:48.956
that I can see,
and it was devastating.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.739
It's a single gunshot wound
to the side of the head.

03:51.782 --> 03:53.739
Through and through.

03:53.782 --> 03:55.391
Never saw it coming.

03:55.434 --> 03:56.739
JIMMY:
He was just enjoying

03:56.782 --> 03:58.043
a beautiful fall morning.

03:58.086 --> 03:59.826
The sun is out,
the birds are chirping.

03:59.869 --> 04:02.434
All is right
with the world and...

04:02.478 --> 04:05.391
and then, out of nowhere, bam.

04:05.434 --> 04:06.521
Lights out.

04:06.565 --> 04:09.086
Kind of poetic,
if you ask me. I...

04:10.652 --> 04:13.043
But you did not ask me,
and I apologize.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.043
Time of death, Duck?

04:15.086 --> 04:16.173
Couple of hours ago.

04:16.217 --> 04:17.173
Details?

04:17.217 --> 04:18.652
Uh, Navy Lieutenant Paul Booth.

04:18.695 --> 04:20.913
32 years old,
married, no kids.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.652
Wife's being notified
as we speak.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.565
Police are ruling
out robbery, boss.

04:24.608 --> 04:27.086
Cash, credit cards--
everything's still on him.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.695
ZIVA:
Except this.

04:29.739 --> 04:31.130
Found it in the grass.

04:31.173 --> 04:34.000
Could be a company badge.

04:34.043 --> 04:35.304
Here's something weird.

04:38.347 --> 04:39.304
Well, looks like a burn.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.043
Not any burn
I've ever seen.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.565
Wow. What was this guy into?

04:44.608 --> 04:46.347
TONY:
I don't know.

04:46.391 --> 04:47.782
Maybe you can tell us, Tim.

04:47.826 --> 04:49.695
Me? Why?

04:51.391 --> 04:52.565
This can't be mine.

04:52.608 --> 04:53.782
TONY:
You sure about that?

04:53.826 --> 04:54.956
It's got your name on it.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.434
McGEE:
Matte-white card stock

04:56.478 --> 04:57.434
with clean border

04:57.478 --> 04:59.086
and seven-point
Helvetica font.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.130
Oh, my God.

05:00.173 --> 05:01.652
McGee.

05:01.695 --> 05:04.652
Boss, I don't know what this is.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.434
I don't even know this guy.

05:06.478 --> 05:09.347
Well, he knew you.

05:19.434 --> 05:21.260
TONY:
Lieutenant Paul Booth,

05:21.304 --> 05:23.695
late 2003, right after
you started here, McGee.

05:23.739 --> 05:25.826
Ring a bell?

05:25.869 --> 05:28.000
No. I still
can't place him.

05:28.043 --> 05:29.956
Okay. Here he
is last year.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.739
Anything?

05:31.782 --> 05:33.434
[sighs]

05:33.478 --> 05:35.086
No, and I've
checked old files.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.000
He wasn't a friend of a victim,

05:37.043 --> 05:38.347
or a witness in any case.

05:38.391 --> 05:39.826
I mean, none
of this makes sense.

05:39.869 --> 05:41.695
How could he have my business
card from eight years ago?

05:41.739 --> 05:43.000
I don't even have
one of those.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.260
Sit, McGee.
We'll figure it out.

05:44.304 --> 05:45.826
Boss, I don't know him, I swear.

05:45.869 --> 05:47.869
Sit.

05:49.739 --> 05:52.608
Lieutenant Paul Booth,
AKA McGee's mystery friend,

05:52.652 --> 05:53.652
served two tours

05:53.695 --> 05:55.521
overseas before joining

05:55.565 --> 05:56.695
the Reserves in 2007.

05:56.739 --> 05:58.086
Criminal background?Nothing.

05:58.130 --> 05:59.652
By all accounts,
a model officer.

05:59.695 --> 06:01.434
Made lieutenant in
just three years.

06:01.478 --> 06:03.217
C.O. says he was
"highly focused

06:03.260 --> 06:04.695
and driven to succeed."

06:04.739 --> 06:07.043
Officials at Waverly
University said the same thing.

06:07.086 --> 06:08.652
Booth taught there
as a math professor.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.565
He was praised
by colleagues and students.

06:10.608 --> 06:11.826
You know, it looks like

06:11.869 --> 06:13.434
teach was skipping class
the past few months.

06:13.478 --> 06:15.739
Taught courses five days a week
for three years, and then...

06:15.782 --> 06:18.043
Look at this-- last spring,
he cut his schedule down.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.521
One class. Once a week.

06:20.565 --> 06:21.956
That's right.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.130
Officials say
he gave no specific

06:24.173 --> 06:25.478
reason for the change.

06:25.521 --> 06:27.695
McGEE:
Maybe he was working
someplace else.

06:27.739 --> 06:28.739
ZIVA:
Abby I.D.'d the symbol
on the badge

06:28.782 --> 06:30.521
as the logo for something called

06:30.565 --> 06:32.608
the Telles Research Group.

06:32.652 --> 06:34.173
Get me an employee
database.

06:34.217 --> 06:36.391
Boss, Telles is locked up tight.

06:36.434 --> 06:39.173
For me to get in, I'd have to
bypass the Pentagon's mainframe

06:39.217 --> 06:41.304
and go straight into
their secure server.

06:41.347 --> 06:42.565
Which I'll happily do.

06:43.608 --> 06:44.826
Why is this group so secret?

06:44.869 --> 06:46.608
These guys develop
all kinds of things,

06:46.652 --> 06:47.913
from children's car seats

06:47.956 --> 06:49.739
to advanced military spyware.

06:49.782 --> 06:50.826
They got their
headquarters out

06:50.869 --> 06:52.000
in the middle of
Virginia somewhere.

06:52.043 --> 06:53.260
[computer chirps]

06:53.304 --> 06:55.434
Boss, I'm in.

06:55.478 --> 06:57.043
Booth was employed as an analyst

06:57.086 --> 06:58.434
in January 2010.

06:58.478 --> 07:01.695
Reported to Telles
vice president John Westfal.

07:01.739 --> 07:02.782
Yeah? And?
That's it.

07:02.826 --> 07:04.521
All the other files
are classified.

07:04.565 --> 07:07.608
Find out what they're hiding.

07:07.652 --> 07:10.478
Tony, Ziva,
go talk to Westfal.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.521
[crying softly]

07:15.478 --> 07:18.521
Mrs. Booth?

07:18.565 --> 07:22.391
Please tell me this
isn't happening.

07:25.565 --> 07:27.521
Sit down.

07:27.565 --> 07:29.478
[sighs]

07:29.521 --> 07:31.521
[groans]

07:38.086 --> 07:41.347
What do you know about
your husband's work?

07:41.391 --> 07:43.956
Paul loved what he did.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.956
He was a great teacher.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.304
When did you last talk?

07:48.347 --> 07:51.391
This morning... pretty early.

07:51.434 --> 07:53.434
Before 6:00, I think.

07:53.478 --> 07:55.347
He sound upset?

07:55.391 --> 07:58.043
More... anxious.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.478
Like he needed
to get off the phone with me.

08:01.521 --> 08:03.304
He was like that a lot lately.

08:03.347 --> 08:06.347
For a long time, I thought
it was because he was...

08:06.391 --> 08:08.391
he was seeing someone else.

08:08.434 --> 08:10.434
But then...

08:12.739 --> 08:15.086
What?

08:17.826 --> 08:20.782
[sighs]

08:20.826 --> 08:24.304
A few weeks ago,
he came home really late.

08:24.347 --> 08:27.652
I looked outside
to make sure it was him, and

08:27.695 --> 08:29.304
that's when I saw...

08:33.391 --> 08:36.826
There was someone was parked
across the street, Agent Gibbs.

08:36.869 --> 08:38.478
Watching him.

08:38.521 --> 08:39.869
Who?

08:39.913 --> 08:41.608
I don't know.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.782
It was a man, I think.

08:43.826 --> 08:45.826
It was hard to tell
in the dark.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.347
You ever see him again?

08:51.217 --> 08:52.695
When?

08:52.739 --> 08:55.260
Last night.

08:55.304 --> 08:57.956
And the night before that.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.826
MAN:
We're self-sufficient.

09:02.869 --> 09:04.652
We installed solar panels,

09:04.695 --> 09:07.869
and we're hoping to raise
our own cattle this year.

09:07.913 --> 09:11.173
Is that why you set up shop
so far out of DC?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.869
So you could milk cows?

09:12.913 --> 09:16.173
We believe a certain amount
of isolation breeds creativity.

09:16.217 --> 09:18.565
Well, Lieutenant Booth
was certainly isolated.

09:18.608 --> 09:21.304
Mm, not even his wife knew
he was here.

09:21.347 --> 09:24.347
Paul was very aware of the
delicate nature of our work.

09:24.391 --> 09:27.304
We were very up-front
when we recruited him.

09:27.347 --> 09:29.565
Were there problems?

09:29.608 --> 09:32.043
No. Never.

09:32.086 --> 09:35.260
No, Paul was a top analyst.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.000
He loved this place; he
loved working in the garden.

09:41.043 --> 09:44.478
None of this will ever
be the same without him.

09:47.434 --> 09:51.043
TONY:
We need to know what you really
do here, Mr. Westfal.

09:51.086 --> 09:54.086
I have a feeling it's more
than just growing tomatoes.

09:54.130 --> 09:57.130
WESTFAL:
Max Ellswood founded Telles

09:57.173 --> 10:02.260
in 1965, in order to develop
cutting-edge military strategy.

10:02.304 --> 10:05.130
His theories have been used
in every war since Vietnam.

10:05.173 --> 10:07.391
His passing was a sad day.

10:07.434 --> 10:09.956
But his legacy lives on.
Telles remains

10:10.000 --> 10:12.304
the first choice when it comes
to military innovative design.

10:12.347 --> 10:13.695
And what designs

10:13.739 --> 10:15.565
was Lieutenant Booth
working on when he died?

10:15.608 --> 10:17.217
I'm afraid that's classified.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.391
Ah. Well, it is important that
we know what he was involved in.

10:20.434 --> 10:22.695
My hands are tied,
Agent DiNozzo.

10:22.739 --> 10:24.608
I can't release
such information.

10:24.652 --> 10:25.956
Can't or won't?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.782
I've said all I need to say.

10:27.826 --> 10:29.434
You can find your way out.

10:29.478 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, thank you.

10:32.043 --> 10:35.043
Huh.

10:35.086 --> 10:36.826
[phone buzzing]

10:36.869 --> 10:38.000
[beep]

10:38.043 --> 10:39.913
That's the third time
in an hour.

10:39.956 --> 10:42.043
I know. I am so sorry.

10:42.086 --> 10:44.782
Will not happen
again, I promise.

10:44.826 --> 10:46.391
Well, there's plenty of time

10:46.434 --> 10:48.869
to turn off each other's calls
once you're married, Mr. Palmer.

10:48.913 --> 10:50.565
I'd advise you not to start

10:50.608 --> 10:53.391
before you've even
exchanged wedding vows.

10:53.434 --> 10:54.956
How'd you know
it was Breena?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.434
You're a man in love.

10:56.478 --> 10:57.565
[chuckles]

10:57.608 --> 10:59.956
I've been there
many times myself,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.913
though not much
lately.

11:02.956 --> 11:04.130
[sighs]

11:04.173 --> 11:06.000
It's just all this
wedding planning stuff--

11:06.043 --> 11:07.260
it just has us on edge.

11:07.304 --> 11:09.086
She's having a hard
time making decisions.

11:09.130 --> 11:14.043
I'm just trying to help, but
everything I say seems wrong.

11:14.086 --> 11:15.565
What should I do?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.826
Just give her
what she wants.

11:16.869 --> 11:18.434
I have no idea what that is.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.739
Welcome to the rest
of your life, Jim-Boy.

11:19.782 --> 11:20.608
[sighs]

11:20.652 --> 11:21.869
What do you got, Duck?

11:21.913 --> 11:24.043
Enough to raise
troubling questions.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.826
Captain Booth died
from trauma

11:26.869 --> 11:29.217
from a single gunshot wound
to the head

11:29.260 --> 11:30.869
with massive
skull fracture

11:30.913 --> 11:33.173
and disbursement
of brain matter.

11:33.217 --> 11:36.173
We also found bullet fragments
lodged in his skull.

11:36.217 --> 11:40.782
These would indicate that the
killer stood about 20 feet away.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.043
Abby is doing tests.

11:42.086 --> 11:44.000
That's not all.

11:44.043 --> 11:45.869
These markings

11:45.913 --> 11:48.217
on the ends of his fingers
are proving mysterious.

11:48.260 --> 11:49.652
Mr. Palmer.

11:49.695 --> 11:51.304
The fingertips
were inflamed,

11:51.347 --> 11:52.739
cracked, and bleeding.

11:52.782 --> 11:55.000
Strongly indicates
a chemical burn.

11:55.043 --> 11:56.260
Drugs?
Possibly.

11:56.304 --> 11:58.913
I've ordered tox screens
and additional panels.

11:58.956 --> 12:01.652
Jethro, this was carried out
with precision.

12:01.695 --> 12:05.347
The proximity to the victim, the
lack of physical evidence.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.478
This is a killer
with considerable skill.

12:10.913 --> 12:12.695
TONY:
Bank records show
Lieutenant Booth

12:12.739 --> 12:13.608
cashed out all his accounts

12:13.652 --> 12:15.000
the day before he died.

12:15.043 --> 12:16.260
Everything was put
into a trust fund

12:16.304 --> 12:17.608
under his
wife's name.

12:17.652 --> 12:18.608
Close to a hundred grand.

12:18.652 --> 12:19.608
He knew he was
in trouble.

12:19.652 --> 12:21.521
Also knew
he was being followed.

12:21.565 --> 12:23.434
Metro Police say he filed
a report last week.

12:23.478 --> 12:25.521
Claimed that someone tried
to run him off the road.

12:25.565 --> 12:26.695
You get a description
of the car?

12:26.739 --> 12:29.608
Yes, a dark-colored sedan--
unknown model.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.043
McGee, e-mails.

12:31.086 --> 12:32.652
I'm still sifting
through Booth's personal e-mails

12:32.695 --> 12:34.260
and Navy correspondence,

12:34.304 --> 12:35.565
but cell phone
records do show

12:35.608 --> 12:37.782
that he made three calls
just before his death.

12:37.826 --> 12:38.565
To who?

12:39.782 --> 12:42.521
The first was to his boss,
John Westfal,

12:42.565 --> 12:44.521
at 5:47 a.m., second

12:44.565 --> 12:47.478
to his wife at 6:01,
and the last call,

12:47.521 --> 12:49.434
just two minutes
before his murder, was made

12:49.478 --> 12:51.565
to an unlisted number.

12:51.608 --> 12:53.695
I'm tracing that number now.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.000
Who is Penelope Langston?

13:05.086 --> 13:05.956
McGee.

13:10.130 --> 13:12.608
Hey, stop.

13:12.652 --> 13:14.608
Boss, I can't right now,
I'm sorry.

13:17.043 --> 13:18.304
She's your what?

13:18.347 --> 13:19.521
And you never
told me?

13:19.565 --> 13:20.521
What, do I have to tell you
everything?

13:20.565 --> 13:21.782
Yes, you do.

13:21.826 --> 13:24.347
Now, listen, does she
know we're coming?

13:24.391 --> 13:26.521
If you learn to make
a bonsai tree...

13:26.565 --> 13:28.434
McGEE:
Penny.

13:28.478 --> 13:31.086
Timothy--
excuse me, kids.

13:31.130 --> 13:32.434
Sweetheart,

13:32.478 --> 13:34.347
how come
the long face?

13:34.391 --> 13:37.608
Have you not been eating those
wheatgrass honey squares I sent?

13:37.652 --> 13:40.043
I told you, they flush out
all the toxins.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.304
And you must be Tony DiNozzo.

13:42.347 --> 13:44.043
I have heard
so much about you.

13:44.086 --> 13:45.043
Well, it's a pleasure.

13:45.086 --> 13:46.869
I wish I could
say the same.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.652
[stammers]

13:48.695 --> 13:49.652
Tony DiNozzo,

13:49.695 --> 13:50.913
this is Penelope
Langston,

13:50.956 --> 13:52.391
my grandmother.

13:52.434 --> 13:53.739
Oh, that word--

13:53.782 --> 13:56.478
grandmother-- so old-fashioned
and so patriarchal.

13:56.521 --> 13:57.739
You call me Penny.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.304
Listen, as much
as I love

13:59.347 --> 14:01.304
a surprise visit,
especially from Timothy...

14:01.347 --> 14:02.478
Penny.

14:03.347 --> 14:04.521
We need to talk.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.652
About Lieutenant Paul Booth.

14:12.391 --> 14:14.347
I know.

14:14.391 --> 14:16.391
I know he's dead.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.695
I tried reaching him
at the university.

14:27.739 --> 14:29.304
They gave me
the news.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.130
How do you know
the lieutenant?

14:31.173 --> 14:32.434
Not for the reason you think,

14:32.478 --> 14:33.739
I can assure you.

14:35.521 --> 14:38.217
He's much too young for me
and not at all my type,

14:38.260 --> 14:40.521
and your dear grandfather,

14:40.565 --> 14:43.217
rest his soul,
would not approve.

14:43.260 --> 14:44.652
You don't want
to talk to me, fine,

14:44.695 --> 14:46.130
but Gibbs is going to have
questions and he's not

14:46.173 --> 14:47.521
going to be nice
about it, trust me.

14:47.565 --> 14:49.565
I think you forget
that I staged a sit-in

14:49.608 --> 14:51.086
with Gloria Steinem
at our nation's capitol

14:51.130 --> 14:52.652
and spent seven nights

14:52.695 --> 14:53.826
in prison--

14:53.869 --> 14:56.130
or jail, really--
after the Selma riots

14:56.173 --> 14:57.521
in '65...

14:57.565 --> 15:00.043
And three in Chicago
after the '68 convention.

15:00.086 --> 15:02.000
And I think I can handle
this Gibbs person.

15:02.043 --> 15:03.304
Genghis Khan
couldn't handle Gibbs.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.217
You should talk to
your grandson, Penny.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.478
Why did Lieutenant Booth call
you right before he died?

15:11.956 --> 15:14.173
[sighs]
Paul was a student of mine.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.695
He was so bright
and thoughtful

15:15.739 --> 15:18.217
and loved math and science
as much as I did.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.043
Both his parents
had passed.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.782
He needed help getting
through some tough times,

15:21.826 --> 15:23.086
and I was there. We...

15:23.130 --> 15:24.391
we stayed in contact.

15:24.434 --> 15:25.521
About what?

15:25.565 --> 15:28.086
Oh, God, professional
things mostly.

15:28.130 --> 15:29.652
He was having
work problems.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.434
Problems with the
Telles Research Group?

15:31.478 --> 15:35.304
Telles? No, with
his work at Waverly.

15:35.347 --> 15:37.086
Oh, since when
was Paul working

15:37.130 --> 15:39.043
for those
imperialist nut-jobs?

15:39.086 --> 15:42.391
Well, that is a, uh,
pretty strong opinion

15:42.434 --> 15:44.739
about a group most people
don't even know exists.

15:44.782 --> 15:47.304
I have strong opinions
about all kinds of things

15:47.347 --> 15:50.826
and I was the wife of
an admiral for 40 years.

15:50.869 --> 15:52.695
Our pillow talk
was enlightening.

15:52.739 --> 15:54.739
Please don't say
"pillow talk."

15:54.782 --> 15:57.260
Okay, how about
postcoital embraces?

15:57.304 --> 15:59.478
[clicks tongue]

15:59.521 --> 16:03.000
Nelson confided in me
about all kinds of things.

16:03.043 --> 16:03.956
So...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.043
what do you know about Telles?

16:06.086 --> 16:08.260
I know that it's a think
tank for the military,

16:08.304 --> 16:10.043
going back to Vietnam.

16:10.086 --> 16:11.521
That's about it.

16:11.565 --> 16:13.347
And Booth never said anything
else about his work there?

16:13.391 --> 16:15.000
No, not a word.

16:15.043 --> 16:17.652
I know you, Timothy, and
I know when you are trying

16:17.695 --> 16:21.000
to fit a square peg
into a round hole.

16:21.043 --> 16:22.913
Sweetheart,

16:22.956 --> 16:24.608
stop trying to
make connections

16:24.652 --> 16:26.695
where there aren't any.

16:26.739 --> 16:29.000
You're so much
better than that.

16:31.739 --> 16:34.652
She's lying.

16:34.695 --> 16:37.347
Some grandson
you are.

16:37.391 --> 16:39.695
You know, my dad used to do
this thing when he...

16:39.739 --> 16:41.826
You'd ask him a question and
he didn't want to answer it,

16:41.869 --> 16:42.956
he'd turn the tables,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.608
tell me I was the one
with the problem.

16:44.652 --> 16:46.652
From what you've said
about your pops,

16:46.695 --> 16:49.086
Penny doesn't seem
anything like him.

16:49.130 --> 16:51.913
I didn't think so,
until now.

16:52.826 --> 16:55.391
You know,
I've always trusted her.

16:55.434 --> 16:56.913
She's someone
I depend on.

16:56.956 --> 16:59.086
Why would
she do this?

16:59.130 --> 17:00.086
I don't know.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.608
There's gotta be a reason.

17:01.652 --> 17:04.782
I don't think she'd
just mislead you.

17:04.826 --> 17:06.869
Unless she has
something to lose.

17:06.913 --> 17:08.956
Well, I guess we have to figure
out what that is, right?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
[scoffs]

17:10.043 --> 17:11.260
You see how stubborn she is.

17:11.304 --> 17:13.043
If I push too hard,
I'm gonna push her away.

17:13.086 --> 17:15.739
Family.

17:15.782 --> 17:18.043
Well, you might not
have a choice, Tim.

17:21.086 --> 17:23.043
[car door closes]

17:27.739 --> 17:28.695
Hey, Abby.

17:28.739 --> 17:30.565
Gibbs, I'm in here.

17:30.608 --> 17:32.608
Here, give me
your hand.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.521
Aah.

17:34.565 --> 17:35.826
It's hot, right?
Yeah.

17:35.869 --> 17:38.130
So imagine how
Lieutenant Booth felt.

17:38.173 --> 17:39.478
Burned by a copy machine?

17:39.521 --> 17:41.173
Yeah, this very machine,
actually.

17:41.217 --> 17:42.347
It was in his basement.

17:42.391 --> 17:43.739
It's, like,
a hundred years old.

17:43.782 --> 17:44.739
Crazy, right?

17:44.782 --> 17:47.173
Let me show you
something crazier.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.695
The lieutenant's fingerprints
were singed

17:49.739 --> 17:51.695
and they tested positive
for high levels

17:51.739 --> 17:56.217
of iron oxide and tungsten
sulfide, aka rust and oil.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.347
You put those
two together

17:57.391 --> 17:58.608
and take a wild
guess what you get.

17:58.652 --> 17:59.739
Come on,
guess, guess, guess.

17:59.782 --> 18:01.565
Okay, observe.

18:01.608 --> 18:03.782
Every time
he made a copy...

18:05.739 --> 18:08.521
...the printer toner
and the heat of the glass

18:08.565 --> 18:09.565
burned his fingers,

18:09.608 --> 18:10.782
but he kept doing it,

18:10.826 --> 18:12.173
like, over and over
and over and over again.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.521
That's dedicated.

18:13.565 --> 18:17.869
I would estimate he made
like 4,000 copies, Gibbs.

18:17.913 --> 18:19.130
I mean, whatever
he was copying

18:19.173 --> 18:21.043
must have been
really important.

18:21.086 --> 18:22.869
Maybe enough to
get him killed.

18:24.652 --> 18:25.913
Thanks.

18:25.956 --> 18:29.695
Tony... I was right.

18:29.739 --> 18:30.695
Penny never
taught Booth.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.217
She retired before
he enrolled.

18:34.043 --> 18:35.043
I got to know what she's hiding.

18:35.086 --> 18:37.000
Guessing it's more
than you think.

18:37.043 --> 18:38.869
McGee, talk to me.

18:38.913 --> 18:40.565
Well, uh, boss, I'm
trying to penetrate

18:40.608 --> 18:42.086
Telles' top
secret files,

18:42.130 --> 18:43.695
but the, the code is
overly complicated.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.652
It's almost
indecipherable.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.826
Decipher it.

18:47.869 --> 18:50.173
Well, that's, that's just it,
I can't.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.565
I mean, I will,
I will, I am.

18:54.608 --> 18:56.478
DiNozzo.

18:56.521 --> 18:58.391
I'd like everyone to say
hello to Andrew Pike,

18:58.434 --> 19:02.000
former analyst and rival of
Telles founder Max Ellswood.

19:02.043 --> 19:04.260
He was fired and banned
from the building.

19:04.304 --> 19:05.173
State employee records show

19:05.217 --> 19:06.565
that Pike
became erratic

19:06.608 --> 19:08.173
after he was turned down
for a promotion.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.521
Ellswood called him
"an egomaniac

19:09.565 --> 19:11.173
with a violent streak."

19:11.217 --> 19:13.652
Where is he now?
ZIVA:
Last known address
is in Virginia,

19:13.695 --> 19:15.347
but it is
from 1972.

19:15.391 --> 19:16.565
Boss, that's not the
only Telles employee

19:16.608 --> 19:18.130
who's had issues.

19:18.173 --> 19:19.826
Found several messages in
Lieutenant Booth's e-mail cache,

19:19.869 --> 19:22.130
all from John Westfal,
all referencing

19:22.173 --> 19:23.782
something called
the Anax Principle.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.304
Could have been
what he was copying.

19:25.347 --> 19:26.347
Put it up.

19:28.565 --> 19:32.434
ZIVA: "The Anax Principle is
privileged information, Paul.

19:32.478 --> 19:36.260
Time to come clean before things
get out of control."

19:36.304 --> 19:38.304
Maybe Westfal was
the one who lost control, huh?

19:40.260 --> 19:41.913
This is insane.

19:41.956 --> 19:44.347
I already told everything I know
to your other agents.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.304
You didn't tell them
about the Anax Principle.

19:46.347 --> 19:48.608
[clock chiming]

19:51.478 --> 19:54.434
All right, what
do you know?

19:54.478 --> 19:56.217
Not enough.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.217
We were hoping
you'd fill us in.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.913
It's highly classified
material, Agent Gibbs.

20:00.956 --> 20:02.565
Not even our top
military commanders

20:02.608 --> 20:03.652
know of its contents.

20:03.695 --> 20:05.000
Sounds like
Lieutenant Booth knew

20:05.043 --> 20:06.217
more than you wanted him to.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.130
Why the e-mails?

20:08.173 --> 20:09.521
Was there a fight?

20:09.565 --> 20:11.086
No, absolutely not.

20:11.130 --> 20:13.304
Where were you the morning
that Booth was shot?

20:13.347 --> 20:15.217
I was home.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.521
Was asleep.

20:16.565 --> 20:18.130
Got anybody
that can verify that?

20:18.173 --> 20:20.217
No.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.043
I know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

20:22.086 --> 20:23.521
I didn't kill Paul.

20:23.565 --> 20:25.086
I was mad at him, yes.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.304
About what?

20:26.347 --> 20:28.739
He was stealing
from me; from us.

20:28.782 --> 20:30.782
I caught him
taking files

20:30.826 --> 20:33.478
for the Anax Principle,
close to 4,000 pages

20:33.521 --> 20:35.347
of privileged
documents.

20:35.391 --> 20:37.478
I didn't say
anything at the time

20:37.521 --> 20:39.304
because I was trying
to get the files back,

20:39.347 --> 20:42.347
but that doesn't
matter now.

20:42.391 --> 20:44.086
Why not?

20:44.130 --> 20:45.434
When I confronted him,

20:45.478 --> 20:48.260
he admitted that he had
given them to someone.

20:48.304 --> 20:49.173
To who?

20:49.217 --> 20:51.000
I don't know.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.608
He was
very protective.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.521
Just said she was
a close friend.

21:07.956 --> 21:09.913
I thought I knew
everything about you.

21:09.956 --> 21:12.869
I thought I
could trust you.

21:12.913 --> 21:14.173
You can.

21:14.217 --> 21:16.043
I know about your
work for Telles...

21:16.086 --> 21:18.173
and I know
about the papers

21:18.217 --> 21:20.956
you and Lieutenant
Booth stole.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.043
Where are they?

21:22.086 --> 21:23.043
You have to tell me.

21:23.086 --> 21:24.304
I can't.

21:24.347 --> 21:26.913
It's for your own good.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.913
Do you know the kind
of trouble you're in?

21:29.956 --> 21:33.000
I made a promise to Paul
to keep his family safe.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.434
I'm yourfamily.

21:36.434 --> 21:40.782
I'm sorry, Timothy,
I... I can't.

21:40.826 --> 21:43.000
I love you, but I can't.

21:44.956 --> 21:46.739
[car engine revving]

21:46.782 --> 21:50.043
[tires squealing]

21:50.086 --> 21:51.869
Penny! Watch out!

21:51.913 --> 21:53.217
Come on!

21:53.260 --> 21:56.739
[tires screeching,
engine revving, both grunting]

21:58.086 --> 22:00.217
[grunts]

22:08.913 --> 22:11.695
DMV records show that the black
sedan's been registered

22:11.739 --> 22:13.521
to multiple Peppy Car
Rental agencies

22:13.565 --> 22:14.478
over the past
two years.

22:14.521 --> 22:15.652
We're still trying
to figure out

22:15.695 --> 22:17.347
which agency had the sedan
as of today.

22:17.391 --> 22:19.130
You I.D. the driver?Nothing yet.

22:19.173 --> 22:20.695
Witnesses gave
no clear description.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.260
But one woman claims

22:22.304 --> 22:23.869
she saw a man
behind the wheel,

22:23.913 --> 22:25.130
but she could not
determine his age.

22:25.173 --> 22:27.000
Keep looking.

22:27.956 --> 22:30.086
Hey...

22:30.130 --> 22:32.000
How's she holding up?

22:32.043 --> 22:33.434
[sighs]

22:33.478 --> 22:35.913
Well, she's a little shaken,
but otherwise okay.

22:35.956 --> 22:37.869
Ducky's checking
her out right now.

22:37.913 --> 22:39.826
She still won't talk?

22:39.869 --> 22:40.956
She threatened
to stage a hunger strike

22:41.000 --> 22:42.608
in the lobby,
if I kept pushing her.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.347
Does she realize
what kind of danger she's in?

22:44.391 --> 22:45.956
Boss, you don't understand.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.043
Once she gets committed to a
cause, there's no stopping her.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.869
Can't wait forever, McGee.

22:49.913 --> 22:51.521
Get her to talk.

22:51.565 --> 22:53.130
McGee-- Or I will.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.695
[phone ringing]

22:55.739 --> 22:58.347
Very Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo. How can I help you?

22:58.391 --> 23:00.913
Uh, Lieutenant Booth's murder

23:00.956 --> 23:02.086
is an ongoing investigation.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.391
I'm afraid I'm gonna have

23:03.434 --> 23:04.652
to give you the standard
"no comment." Thank...

23:06.086 --> 23:08.130
What about the Anax Principle?

23:09.565 --> 23:10.695
Uh-huh.

23:10.739 --> 23:13.652
We'll be in touch.

23:16.565 --> 23:17.695
DiNozzo?

23:17.739 --> 23:20.086
That was Michael Sheedy,

23:20.130 --> 23:22.217
senior editor
at the DC Chronicle.

23:22.260 --> 23:23.347
Yeah? So?

23:23.391 --> 23:24.434
Apparently,
he's been communicating

23:24.478 --> 23:25.521
with Penelope Langston

23:25.565 --> 23:27.217
about the Telles
Research Group

23:27.260 --> 23:28.913
and the Anax Principle.
She's meeting

23:28.956 --> 23:30.695
with him tonight.

23:30.739 --> 23:32.565
Wait's over.

23:32.608 --> 23:34.608
Go.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.130
Agent Gibbs,
I always knew

23:39.173 --> 23:41.695
that my grandson
would introduce us.

23:41.739 --> 23:45.086
I just never imagined
that it would be like this.

23:46.652 --> 23:49.304
You failed to tell me
he was so handsome, Timothy.

23:49.347 --> 23:50.478
[sighs]

23:50.521 --> 23:51.782
Great eyes.

23:53.869 --> 23:55.869
Why are you talking
to the press?

23:55.913 --> 23:59.043
I'm a free citizen,
Agent Gibbs.

23:59.086 --> 24:01.043
I can talk
to whomever I want.

24:01.086 --> 24:04.086
Are you giving them information
about the Anax Principle?

24:06.130 --> 24:08.086
That's really none
of your business.

24:08.130 --> 24:10.000
Oh, yeah, it is.
Hmm.

24:10.043 --> 24:12.869
Since you've done nothing but
lie for the past two days.

24:14.086 --> 24:18.608
Your inflated sense of authority
does not impress me.

24:18.652 --> 24:20.695
I have never been
a fan of fascism.

24:20.739 --> 24:23.869
What are you hiding,
Ms. Langston?

24:23.913 --> 24:26.000
I'm not hiding anything. I...

24:27.130 --> 24:29.565
I was protecting a friend.

24:29.608 --> 24:31.173
I doubt that.

24:31.217 --> 24:32.521
I think you're
protecting yourself.

24:32.565 --> 24:35.000
There's only
one reason for that.

24:35.043 --> 24:37.000
Enlighten me, Agent Gibbs.

24:37.043 --> 24:40.043
You know something about
Lieutenant Booth's death.Boss...

24:40.086 --> 24:42.217
Maybe you're involved with
something way over your head.

24:42.260 --> 24:44.434
No...Maybe you're covering
for the real killer...

24:44.478 --> 24:45.391
Enough!

25:01.826 --> 25:03.260
Go home, McGee.
You can't be a professional.

25:03.304 --> 25:04.521
Go home.

25:04.565 --> 25:06.260
Boss, I won't let
you treat her like that.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.695
She's my grandmother.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.434
She's also the lead witness
in a murder investigation.

25:09.478 --> 25:11.478
What do you want me to do,
needlepoint my questions?

25:11.521 --> 25:13.739
Penny had nothing to do with
Lieutenant Booth's death.

25:13.782 --> 25:15.695
I never said she did.What are you
going to do,

25:15.739 --> 25:18.695
you going to break her
down till she cracks?That's how it's done, Tim.

25:18.739 --> 25:20.434
I don't like this any
better than you do.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.869
I know that she's
a family member.

25:21.913 --> 25:24.304
She means everything to me.

25:24.347 --> 25:26.304
I respect that.

25:26.347 --> 25:29.434
This is about murder.
A guy is dead.

25:29.478 --> 25:32.695
Enough. We find what's
in those papers.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.086
We find Booth's killer.

25:37.217 --> 25:39.260
And she's the one
that can tell us.

25:46.304 --> 25:48.043
She'll talk to me.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.695
You worked as an analyst
for the Telles group,

26:10.739 --> 26:12.956
and then you quit. Why?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.260
Don't do this, Timothy.
Please don't.

26:17.304 --> 26:19.173
Your experience with
the Telles Group--

26:19.217 --> 26:20.608
I need to know everything.

26:20.652 --> 26:22.260
I knew I shouldn't have given
Paul your business card.

26:22.304 --> 26:24.260
I just--
at the time, I thought...

26:24.304 --> 26:26.478
Penny.

26:26.521 --> 26:28.260
Now.

26:33.043 --> 26:36.000
PENNY [over speaker]:
The paper I published--

26:36.043 --> 26:38.130
caught Max Ellswood's
attention.

26:38.173 --> 26:41.695
He asked me to be the first
female analyst to work

26:41.739 --> 26:43.434
on something called
the Anax Principle.

26:45.043 --> 26:47.130
It was 1968.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.347
Oh, of course I said yes.

26:49.391 --> 26:53.391
And I've regretted that decision
all my life.

26:53.434 --> 26:55.043
What happened?

26:55.086 --> 26:57.173
They lied.

26:57.217 --> 26:59.000
[chuckles]
What else is new.

26:59.043 --> 27:02.304
I was told that I was
working on something

27:02.347 --> 27:05.217
that would keep
our men in Vietnam safe.

27:05.260 --> 27:07.826
But in a...
a few years in, I learned

27:07.869 --> 27:10.608
that I wasn't helping anyone.

27:10.652 --> 27:15.217
Instead, I was, I was creating
a weapon of destruction.

27:15.260 --> 27:18.043
I wanted to make amends.

27:18.086 --> 27:20.434
You know, warn people. I...

27:20.478 --> 27:21.521
They silenced you?

27:21.565 --> 27:25.347
Like anybody could
shut me up?

27:25.391 --> 27:28.043
I took action, Timothy.

27:28.086 --> 27:30.391
I armed myself with
the First Amendment.

27:30.434 --> 27:33.086
We were just about
to go to print

27:33.130 --> 27:34.391
when the war ended,

27:34.434 --> 27:37.304
and the Anax Principle
was abandoned.

27:39.782 --> 27:42.782
Or so we thought.

27:42.826 --> 27:44.391
Penny, what is it?

27:44.434 --> 27:47.304
Oh, sweetheart...

27:47.347 --> 27:48.869
it's better you don't know.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.782
How'd you meet Lieutenant Booth?

27:53.826 --> 27:57.043
Like me, Paul was lied to.

27:57.086 --> 28:02.043
He learned that I was one
of the last living members
from the original group,

28:02.086 --> 28:03.652
and sought me out.

28:03.695 --> 28:08.913
We agreed to finish
what I'd started.

28:10.695 --> 28:13.739
I convinced him...

28:13.782 --> 28:15.478
that we were doing
the right thing.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.826
It's not your fault.

28:21.826 --> 28:24.521
You inspired him.
You taught him so much.

28:27.739 --> 28:30.956
About how to stand up
for himself.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.130
About how to be
exactly who he was,

28:34.173 --> 28:35.826
no matter what
anyone else thought.

28:35.869 --> 28:37.086
Especially his father.

28:41.043 --> 28:43.000
He'll always love you for that.

28:46.130 --> 28:48.782
You've never told me
this before.

28:48.826 --> 28:51.130
It's the truth.

28:56.608 --> 28:59.826
Do you have any idea
who did this?

29:04.695 --> 29:08.608
All the way from the lovely
tropical island of Bali,
courtesy of our friends

29:08.652 --> 29:11.652
at the State Department,
say hello to Andrew Pike.

29:11.695 --> 29:13.043
I already told the guy
from State

29:13.086 --> 29:14.521
I don't even know
this Paul Booth.

29:14.565 --> 29:16.521
But you do know about
the Anax Principle.

29:18.695 --> 29:19.826
How do you even...?

29:19.869 --> 29:22.347
That was something
I created years ago.

29:22.391 --> 29:23.565
But that's-- it's...

29:23.608 --> 29:25.478
all over now.

29:25.521 --> 29:27.913
Not according
to Penelope Langston.

29:27.956 --> 29:30.130
The project started up
again last year.

29:30.173 --> 29:33.782
She said you harbored anger
against Max Ellswood and Telles.

29:33.826 --> 29:35.695
Claimed they stole
your idea.

29:35.739 --> 29:39.000
And one day you'd
make them pay.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.086
Yeah, I felt betrayed
and rejected.

29:42.130 --> 29:45.652
But I was 23. Thought I'd change
the world and then...

29:45.695 --> 29:47.043
Then what?

29:47.086 --> 29:51.043
Ellswood wanted to market
the Anax Principle.

29:51.086 --> 29:52.565
I just wanted it
to be a test--

29:52.608 --> 29:55.782
a new kind of experiment.

29:55.826 --> 29:58.347
I left and never looked back.
That was 39 years ago.

29:58.391 --> 30:00.869
How long have you
been in Bali?

30:00.913 --> 30:03.739
39 years.

30:04.913 --> 30:07.869
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

30:07.913 --> 30:11.869
but I never meant for
that project to go public.

30:14.739 --> 30:17.391
It is a threat
to our way of life.

30:22.608 --> 30:25.086
Boss, I'm just one firewall away

30:25.130 --> 30:27.347
from Telles'
top-secret files.

30:27.391 --> 30:29.826
It's taken me a while, but I
think I'm actually getting in.

30:32.565 --> 30:33.565
Got it.

30:33.608 --> 30:34.869
All right.

30:34.913 --> 30:38.086
Searching all projects
between 1967

30:38.130 --> 30:39.478
and 1972.

30:43.739 --> 30:45.347
Boss, Andrew Pike was right.

30:47.913 --> 30:51.043
Ooh, a caterpillar.

30:51.086 --> 30:53.347
Scary.

30:53.391 --> 30:55.347
I do not understand.

30:55.391 --> 30:56.260
Watch.

30:56.304 --> 30:57.695
It's a hybrid.

30:57.739 --> 30:59.521
It's part insect, part machine.

30:59.565 --> 31:02.826
The Anax Principle merges
technology with nature.

31:02.869 --> 31:05.086
Ellswood said that war should
not only be fought

31:05.130 --> 31:07.434
on the battlefields,
but in the fields themselves.

31:07.478 --> 31:09.086
He wanted to change the game.

31:09.130 --> 31:11.434
The hybrid's remote controlled,
mutates quickly.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.608
can infiltrate crops,
multiply fast.

31:13.652 --> 31:15.217
It's like a genetically
engineered plague.

31:15.260 --> 31:17.391
Has the potential to kill
thousands of people.

31:17.434 --> 31:19.304
Yeah, no wonder it was
kept a secret.

31:19.347 --> 31:22.043
Not anymore.

31:22.086 --> 31:25.130
Penny's meeting with Michael
Sheedy at the DC Chronicle.

31:25.173 --> 31:27.217
I'd rather she not
go alone, boss.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.739
GIBBS:
Go.

31:30.739 --> 31:32.217
McGEE:
This place is empty.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.347
PENNY:
That must be Michael.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.391
Okay, there's my signal.

31:50.086 --> 31:52.347
McGEE:
Why isn't he getting out?

31:56.304 --> 31:58.043
Penny, wait.
Something's not right.

31:58.086 --> 31:59.217
Timothy, I'm perfectly capable

31:59.260 --> 32:01.000
of handling this...[tires squealing]

32:01.043 --> 32:03.565
Look out!
Look out!

32:04.869 --> 32:06.043
Oh, no, Michael!

32:06.086 --> 32:07.739
Oh, Michael!

32:13.304 --> 32:15.304
[crying quietly]

32:23.521 --> 32:24.869
ZIVA: Ducky's finishing,
but the evidence still points

32:24.913 --> 32:27.478
to our killer.Another execution, boss.

32:27.521 --> 32:29.130
He won't stop till he gets
what he wants.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.608
He wants me.

32:31.434 --> 32:33.521
No, we don't know that yet.

32:33.565 --> 32:34.782
Yeah, we do.

32:36.652 --> 32:39.043
McGee, analysts who developed
the Anax Principle.

32:42.869 --> 32:44.826
TONY:
John Westfal never said he was

32:44.869 --> 32:45.826
part of the original group.

32:45.869 --> 32:47.304
[typing]

32:47.347 --> 32:49.304
PENNY: Wouldn't be
the first time he lied.

32:49.347 --> 32:51.000
Was he a problem?

32:51.043 --> 32:54.391
John was a rich, entitled kid.

32:54.434 --> 32:55.521
Ellswood took him
under his wing,

32:55.565 --> 32:57.173
promised him things.Like what?

32:57.217 --> 32:58.478
Gave him the reigns,

32:58.521 --> 32:59.782
let him make decisions
he shouldn't have made.

32:59.826 --> 33:02.086
He got power hungry?Telles is John's whole life.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.521
He'd do anything
to keep power.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.173
Maybe even kill.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.521
The rental car was paid for
using a private account

33:08.565 --> 33:10.608
and the signature belongs
to none other than...

33:10.652 --> 33:11.521
John Westfal.

33:11.565 --> 33:13.000
Bring him in.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.913
It's a forgery.

33:24.956 --> 33:26.043
I didn't sign this.

33:26.086 --> 33:27.869
I'm not playing
games, Mr. Westfal.

33:27.913 --> 33:30.565
Well, someone's setting me up
to ruin my good name.

33:30.608 --> 33:33.260
We can do this easy or
we can do this hard--

33:33.304 --> 33:34.347
it's your choice.

33:34.391 --> 33:37.260
I'm not a violent person,
Agent Gibbs.

33:37.304 --> 33:39.304
I would never kill anyone.

33:39.347 --> 33:41.086
Got witness testimony
and a stack of evidence

33:41.130 --> 33:42.086
that says otherwise.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.347
No, you're wrong.

33:43.391 --> 33:44.434
Prove it.

33:49.913 --> 33:51.913
That's what I thought.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.739
Paul was right.

33:55.782 --> 33:58.130
It was evil.

33:58.173 --> 34:02.130
That's what he called
the Anax Principle--

34:02.173 --> 34:06.521
pure evil-- and I knew it
but I just kept working.

34:06.565 --> 34:08.043
I couldn't stop myself.

34:08.086 --> 34:10.260
Had to protect your power.

34:10.304 --> 34:13.043
I don't have any power.

34:13.086 --> 34:15.086
[laughing]:
I never did.

34:17.652 --> 34:21.782
Paul... Paul had
all the guts.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.260
He had courage.

34:23.304 --> 34:26.347
He took risks,
spoke the truth...

34:27.391 --> 34:29.565
...and I

34:29.608 --> 34:32.695
just fell in line,

34:32.739 --> 34:35.913
did whatever the ones
at the top told me to do.

34:38.304 --> 34:40.347
I admired him,
Agent Gibbs.

34:41.652 --> 34:44.043
Why would I kill him?

34:48.043 --> 34:49.130
Abbs, got your message.

34:49.173 --> 34:50.130
What's up?

34:50.173 --> 34:51.217
Gibbs, hi, lots.

34:51.260 --> 34:52.652
Um, the bullet
fragments

34:52.695 --> 34:55.173
that came from Lieutenant
Booth-- total dead end.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.043
No pun intended.

34:58.086 --> 35:00.391
And second-- and
this is good-- um,

35:00.434 --> 35:03.000
Ducky found traces
of a strange material

35:03.043 --> 35:04.695
on our second victim,

35:04.739 --> 35:06.739
and you're not going
to believe what it is.

35:06.782 --> 35:08.608
It's a highly unusual,
one-of-a-kind,

35:08.652 --> 35:11.086
super strong carbon fiber
that was used

35:11.130 --> 35:13.130
to craft
military weapons.

35:14.304 --> 35:15.260
When?

35:15.304 --> 35:16.869
Oh, like,
like, way back,

35:16.913 --> 35:19.000
like the '50s or the '60s.

35:19.043 --> 35:20.826
I mean, it's not
that far back for you,

35:20.869 --> 35:22.913
but, for me, that is like,
that's, like, way...

35:22.956 --> 35:24.695
So...

35:24.739 --> 35:26.391
I traced
the carbon fiber back

35:26.434 --> 35:28.260
to the manufacturer
in Louisiana.

35:28.304 --> 35:31.000
They make
experimental stuff but

35:31.043 --> 35:33.956
they also make
some combat weapons,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.434
including one
just like this bad boy.

35:37.478 --> 35:39.478
It's a limited edition
combat-approved

35:39.521 --> 35:42.956
.45-caliber handgun
dubbed the "Black Hand."

35:43.000 --> 35:45.956
It was used during Vietnam
for only two years--

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
1962 and 1963.

35:49.043 --> 35:50.956
Abbs, zoom in right here.

35:58.652 --> 36:00.608
TONY:
Our killer's a G.I. Joe?

36:00.652 --> 36:02.173
Was.

36:02.217 --> 36:04.782
Number of Telles analysts
who served in the military?

36:04.826 --> 36:06.130
[typing]

36:07.173 --> 36:08.826
Three--

36:08.869 --> 36:10.043
Andrew Pike,
Max Ellswood,

36:10.086 --> 36:13.000
and a low-level analyst
named Eric Velez.

36:13.043 --> 36:14.521
How many army?

36:14.565 --> 36:16.043
[typing]

36:16.086 --> 36:18.565
Just two-- Ellswood and Velez.

36:18.608 --> 36:19.565
Years served?

36:19.608 --> 36:20.956
Ellswood
from 1955

36:21.000 --> 36:24.956
to 1963 and Velez from...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.826
That can't be right.

36:28.347 --> 36:29.782
McGee, come on.

36:29.826 --> 36:31.565
Velez didn't serve
until the first Iraq War.

36:31.608 --> 36:32.869
Enlisted in 1990.

36:34.043 --> 36:35.826
Well, come on,

36:35.869 --> 36:38.173
I love science fiction
as much as the next guy,

36:38.217 --> 36:39.565
but Ellswood's
long gone.

36:39.608 --> 36:41.347
His plane crashed into
the Rockies 23 years ago.

36:41.391 --> 36:43.130
They find the body?

36:45.739 --> 36:47.739
No.

36:49.739 --> 36:51.391
Ducky, it's McGee.
Is Penny there?

36:51.434 --> 36:52.652
DUCKY:
She left.

36:52.695 --> 36:53.913
What do you mean she left?
When?

36:53.956 --> 36:55.000
About an hour ago.

37:07.913 --> 37:09.913
[rustling]

37:09.956 --> 37:11.130
Hello?

37:11.173 --> 37:13.173
[rustling continues]

37:17.956 --> 37:20.347
I said who's there?

37:27.739 --> 37:29.739
Max.

37:32.782 --> 37:34.652
Heard you've been
keeping yourself

37:34.695 --> 37:39.434
rather busy these
days, Penelope.

37:39.478 --> 37:41.652
But then, I'd expect
nothing less.

37:43.565 --> 37:47.130
Always such a busybody.

37:47.173 --> 37:51.260
Had to prove you were
as good as the boys.

37:52.739 --> 37:54.739
All these years...

37:54.782 --> 37:57.695
we thought you were dead.

37:57.739 --> 38:00.913
Yes, well, I was.

38:00.956 --> 38:04.260
The day the military pulled
the plug on my creation,

38:04.304 --> 38:05.521
it killed me.

38:05.565 --> 38:09.173
I had no reason
to be here anymore.

38:09.217 --> 38:10.478
But when I found out

38:10.521 --> 38:14.434
they'd green-lit
the project again, I felt ...

38:14.478 --> 38:16.086
reborn.

38:16.130 --> 38:19.739
So you can imagine
how upset I was

38:19.782 --> 38:24.521
when I also heard you were up
to your old tricks.

38:24.565 --> 38:27.521
Out to destroy
my legacy.

38:27.565 --> 38:29.130
Don't move.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.869
I wasn't about
to let that happen.

38:35.739 --> 38:38.478
You were wrong, Max,
about the Anax Principle.

38:38.521 --> 38:41.391
About everything.

38:42.956 --> 38:44.260
I did great things.

38:44.304 --> 38:46.173
And I will again.

38:46.217 --> 38:47.521
GIBBS:
No, you won't.

38:52.521 --> 38:54.695
Please don't.
Don't do this.

38:54.739 --> 38:56.000
Don't do this.

38:56.043 --> 38:57.869
Already done.

38:57.913 --> 39:00.000
You can't!
This is wrong!

39:00.043 --> 39:01.173
This is wrong!

39:01.217 --> 39:02.782
I've done great things!

39:02.826 --> 39:06.260
They need me!
They need me!

39:06.304 --> 39:08.260
They can't do it
without me.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.130
[laughter]

39:14.173 --> 39:15.826
One year,
Timothy became

39:15.869 --> 39:18.478
obsessed with my red pumps,
you know?

39:18.521 --> 39:19.652
He wore them
everywhere.

39:19.695 --> 39:22.652
I mean, to the grocery store,
to church...

39:22.695 --> 39:24.000
What'd the preacher
have to say about that?

39:24.043 --> 39:26.130
"Hey, kid, don't upstage me."

39:26.173 --> 39:29.478
As he's teetering down
the aisle to the front.

39:29.521 --> 39:31.739
And I... Hi, honey.

39:31.782 --> 39:32.695
Hi.

39:32.739 --> 39:33.826
[all laughing]

39:33.869 --> 39:34.826
What's so funny?

39:34.869 --> 39:36.434
The red pumps.

39:36.478 --> 39:39.347
We were just really
enjoying that story.

39:39.391 --> 39:41.043
[Ziva, Tony laugh]

39:41.086 --> 39:42.521
You little cross-dresser you.

39:42.565 --> 39:43.608
Does the Pope know?

39:43.652 --> 39:45.086
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, darling.

39:45.130 --> 39:46.434
You know, it's healthy

39:46.478 --> 39:48.913
to explore all sides
of yourself.

39:48.956 --> 39:50.217
I was five.

39:50.260 --> 39:52.043
Yeah, that's what's sort
of brilliant about it.

39:52.086 --> 39:53.521
[Tony and Ziva
continue laughing]

39:53.565 --> 39:55.000
It's getting late.

39:55.043 --> 39:57.260
Way past your date's
bedtime there, Tony.

39:58.652 --> 39:59.956
And I gotta get you home, Penny.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.652
No need.
I already have a ride.

40:02.695 --> 40:05.043
With who?

40:05.086 --> 40:07.304
It's been a pleasure
to meet you both.

40:07.347 --> 40:08.739
And Ziva, Tony...

40:08.782 --> 40:10.086
Until next time,
mon cherie.

40:10.130 --> 40:12.130
Timothy's lucky to have you.

40:12.173 --> 40:13.521
No, weare the lucky ones.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.913
Whoa.

40:19.173 --> 40:21.521
[whispering]:
Oh, that Tony DiNozzo.

40:23.608 --> 40:25.347
[chuckles]
It comforts me

40:25.391 --> 40:26.260
to know that you're with

40:26.304 --> 40:29.000
such a good
group of people.

40:29.043 --> 40:31.173
I'll admit even Gibbs
has begun

40:31.217 --> 40:33.000
to grow on me
a little bit.

40:33.043 --> 40:36.391
His cold despotic ways?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.217
Really part of his charm.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.043
Who knew?

40:40.086 --> 40:41.652
He actually reminds me
a lot of...

40:43.391 --> 40:45.086
...you know,
a little bit.

40:45.130 --> 40:48.652
Yeah, in other words...

40:48.695 --> 40:52.434
he loves you, but has
no idea how to show it.

40:55.260 --> 40:56.391
Does he?

40:56.434 --> 40:59.217
Oh, sweetheart,
he loves you so much.

40:59.260 --> 41:01.782
He always has, Timothy.

41:01.826 --> 41:04.478
Deeply.

41:07.086 --> 41:08.695
You need to take the
first step, Timothy.

41:08.739 --> 41:10.391
Call him.

41:12.130 --> 41:15.086
It's been almost seven years.
I wouldn't know what to say.

41:15.130 --> 41:18.391
Oh, you're a smart boy.
You'll figure it out.

41:20.304 --> 41:22.869
Oh, here's my ride.

41:26.565 --> 41:27.869
Wait, is this a date?

41:27.913 --> 41:29.521
No, just a cocktail, Timothy.

41:29.565 --> 41:32.043
DUCKY:
Or cocktails.

41:33.130 --> 41:35.478
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

41:35.521 --> 41:39.130
[whispers]:
Sweetheart, call him.

41:45.782 --> 41:47.130
And you, Doctor,
good evening.

41:47.173 --> 41:49.217
So have you made up
your mind?

41:49.260 --> 41:50.434
English or Italian?

41:50.478 --> 41:52.043
I think Korean.[chuckles]

41:52.086 --> 41:54.260
I'd like to have
a bunch of little pots.

42:12.869 --> 42:19.739
[phone line ringing]

42:19.782 --> 42:20.739
MAN:
Hello.

42:20.782 --> 42:22.478
Hi... Dad?

42:22.521 --> 42:25.000
It's me, Tim.
