00:04.338 --> 00:06.240
Hi.

00:06.274 --> 00:07.608
Hey.
So--

00:07.641 --> 00:09.643
If I hold this bag
of groceries like this,

00:09.677 --> 00:12.413
can you tell
I'm pregnant?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.352
I can tell.

00:18.386 --> 00:23.391
But then, I'm not part
of the Rhythm Nation.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.260
We're having dinner
with your parents,

00:26.294 --> 00:27.661
and if your mother finds out
that I'm pregnant

00:27.695 --> 00:30.064
because I had unsafe sex
on an airplane

00:30.098 --> 00:30.964
and haven't told
the father yet

00:30.998 --> 00:32.166
because he's engaged
to another woman,

00:32.200 --> 00:37.171
she is going to find some way
of making it sound sordid.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.144
Fine. I'll wear a baggy coat,
but with pockets.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.378
I'm keeping
this fudge close.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.616
Still, I do not want them
to find out yet.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.153
God only knows
what your mother can say.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.322
Oh, I'm guessing it's something
in the ball park of,

00:54.355 --> 00:55.356
"Don't worry, dear.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.160
Hardly anyone uses the term
bastard anymore."

01:01.429 --> 01:02.263
Or "I would have thought
a girl like you

01:02.296 --> 01:05.866
would have a purse
full of condoms."

01:05.899 --> 01:09.603
Those come way too easily
for you.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.273
You know what?

01:12.306 --> 01:13.641
I'm not going.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.542
We have to go.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.877
My parents
are officially back together

01:16.910 --> 01:18.679
since my father broke off
his affair with Tina.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.713
They want
to celebrate it.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.216
Fine, then we'll just talk
about that.
Whoa.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.617
I said celebrate it.
Not acknowledge it.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.586
As far as their concerned,
it never happened.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.587
That's crazy.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.721
That's Connecticut.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.424
I'm serious. That's what it says
on the license plate.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.193
"Nothing potentially awkward".

01:32.226 --> 01:35.363
With a picture of a beaver
looking the other way.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.633
[upbeat jazz music]

01:45.439 --> 01:46.474
Really?

01:46.507 --> 01:53.447
Are you sure you have all
the astronauts you need?

01:53.481 --> 01:56.317
All right.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.619
Well, thanks for checking.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.421
Stephanie is it?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.523
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.693
Well, thank you, Warren.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.629
Hey, honey.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.500
How you holding up since
you got fired from Jack Talk?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.802
Honestly, Kare--

02:14.835 --> 02:17.205
I'm a Chad Lowe.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.575
There are no jobs
out there.

02:21.609 --> 02:25.513
And I've even checked
outer space.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.481
Trust me, honey.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.452
You do not want to work
in outer space.

02:31.485 --> 02:37.191
Nope. You just spend your whole
day chasing floating poop.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.299
Oh Jackie, come on.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.335
I mean, I don't know
who you're trying to kid.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.470
We both know
there's only one thing

02:49.503 --> 02:51.472
that you ever really
wanted to be.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.441
A strategically
placed staple

02:53.474 --> 02:56.544
in an Abercrombie
& Fitch catalogue.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.512
No, honey.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.281
An actor.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.650
That's the only thing
that you've ever

03:02.683 --> 03:05.519
been passionate about
in your entire life.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.321
And look at you.
You're built for it.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.690
You've got those short legs
and a big torso.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.793
And a wobbly head
like Al Pacino.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.464
Oh, never mind.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.765
I can't go back.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.301
I said farewell
to acting not once.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.871
Not twice.
But thrice times.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.839
That's my
Shakespearian training.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.808
You never lose it.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.579
I do miss it.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.547
Well, of course
you do, honey.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.317
And you've clearly
been looking for auditions.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.485
I mean, come on.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.453
There's a copy of Backstage
magazine right here.

03:39.487 --> 03:44.692
Or, as I like to call it,
Waiter Weekly.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.496
Well, I'd be lying if I said
I only bought it

03:48.529 --> 03:50.298
to hide the copy
of Latino Inches

03:50.331 --> 03:52.400
I was reading
on the subway.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.768
I do want
to get back in, Karen.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.506
Both to acting
and Latino men.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.276
Hey. Look at this
right here.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.511
Here's something
you'd be good for.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.813
It's for a new
TV cop show.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.816
The role
of Squealing Queen #3.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.487
Squealing Queen?

04:13.521 --> 04:18.426
How would I even begin
to play that?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.362
Karen, you're bending
my ethnic porn.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.666
Oh, God.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.635
I wish I still had
my acting teacher Zandra.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.403
She was
an incredible coach.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.872
The second
your acting was fake,

04:31.905 --> 04:35.709
she put a cigarette out
in your ear.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.515
Hi, hi.
Hey.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.784
There's my son.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.620
Look at him.
So good with clothes.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.688
Is there anything
you can't wear?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.557
Well, mom's clothes.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.726
Remember we talked about that
when I was ten?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.662
I was never angry
you were wearing 'em.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.696
I was angry
you had them tailored.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.365
Grace--

04:57.398 --> 05:02.436
I can't wait to get you kids
down in the basement.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.572
Or as I refer to it now,
the microbrewery.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.640
Oh, you know,
George has taken up

05:06.674 --> 05:08.442
the most
magnificent hobby.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.543
He's fermenting hops.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.578
Wow.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.613
I haven't been down
to the basement in years.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.682
And not since I turned it
into a roller disco

05:14.715 --> 05:16.917
for my Sweet 16 party.

05:18.652 --> 05:23.557
Mom and I had such
a good time.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.426
So you're making beer?

05:25.459 --> 05:26.460
No, no, no--
it's not beer.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.563
It's small batches
of boutique ale.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.999
And, by the way, I call
the first one Georgie's Girl.

05:32.032 --> 05:37.638
Because it's bubbly,
full bodied, and 6% alcohol.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.474
God, you guys
look so cute

05:40.508 --> 05:45.646
ever since you got
back to the future.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.880
The DVD.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.382
Great movie.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.450
Really brings
people together.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.419
Not that
you had an affair--

05:52.753 --> 05:55.623
I brought fudge.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.025
Come on, kids.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.627
Have a Georgie Girl.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.561
You gotta try it.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.529
Be careful when you drink it,
will you?

06:01.562 --> 06:04.632
Because I lost a cigar
during the process.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.869
None for me, thanks.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.003
Why? You pregnant?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.706
No. No, I'm not pregnant.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.508
I'm--
An alcoholic.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.877
It's a shock, I know.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.746
And beer
is a real problem.

06:18.779 --> 06:22.416
That's how she got
that big gut.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.887
Thanks for that.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.724
I-I am pregnant.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.792
Oh, thank God.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.762
I would hate to think
that you stopped drinking

06:34.795 --> 06:38.666
for some
emotional problem.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.434
Grace, that is fantastic.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.902
Who's our little girl?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.771
Hey who--I mean?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.439
Don't look at me.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.475
I haven't been near that thing
since college.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.544
Well whether you like it
or not,

06:50.578 --> 06:53.046
I'm gonna tell you what I think
about you being pregnant.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.682
Dad, why don't
you take us downstairs

06:54.715 --> 06:55.816
and show us
how beer is made.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.551
It's okay.

06:57.585 --> 07:02.823
Marilyn, I got pregnant with my
ex-husband's baby by accident.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.092
Well darling,
I was about to say

07:05.125 --> 07:08.496
that I think you are going
to make a wonderful mother.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.964
And whatever
I can do to help,

07:10.998 --> 07:12.900
I'm here.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.036
Thank you.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.746
Oh, look who
I brought.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.750
It's Zandra,
your old acting teacher.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.520
Oh, my God.
Zandra, how are you?

07:32.553 --> 07:37.758
Where's that ham sandwich
I ordered, you walking fart?

07:37.791 --> 07:41.529
So Z, thanks for helping me
with this audition.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.630
I couldn't do it
without you.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.864
Here's the scene
I'm working on.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.033
Now, you read
the part

07:46.066 --> 07:48.001
of hard-boiled
Detective Chuck Rafferdy.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.503
He's one of the leads.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.839
And I'll be reading
Squealing Queen #3,

07:51.872 --> 07:54.608
who says,
"Eek. Dropped your gun."

07:54.642 --> 07:57.578
I don't want
your magazine.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.514
I just wanna know
when we're gonna land.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.919
You see that, Karen?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.087
She's trying to get me
to understand

08:07.120 --> 08:10.157
that I am the pilot
of my own career.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.527
Really?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.829
Because it seems like
she's just trying

08:15.863 --> 08:18.832
to suck ketchup
out of her hair.

08:18.866 --> 08:22.703
These fries
are too thin.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.941
Mmm. Too thin.

08:27.975 --> 08:28.942
Good point.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.944
There's not a lot
on the page.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.781
Yeah. I don't
know, honey.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.784
I took a dropper full
of cat tranquilizer this morning

08:36.817 --> 08:39.687
and even I think
she's little off.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.857
Karen,

08:43.891 --> 08:48.829
this woman is a genius
and clear as a bell.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.798
I know you.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.601
You're Jack McFarland.

08:53.634 --> 08:59.006
The worst actor
I ever saw.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.073
Oh, my God, Karen.
You're right.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.108
She's crazy.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.680
She's talking
absolute nonsense.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.948
What am I going
to do now?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.683
I can't go on
that audition.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.886
Not without Zandra.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.121
Honey, come on.
You don't need her.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.959
Hell, I can put
a cigarette out in your eye.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.061
In my ear, Karen.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.696
Not my eye.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.867
You obviously have
no understanding of the craft.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.838
Hey, Grace--
Look what I found in the attic.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.975
Almost broke my neck tripping
over Will's old Easy Bake Oven.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.977
It's a gift for me?

09:37.010 --> 09:37.978
For the baby.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.081
Oh, that's nice too.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.115
Hey, what's that?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.884
Oh, your dad just
gave it to me.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.253
It's a baby blanket,
and, oh, it's beautiful.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.055
And it's mine.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.123
Oh George, that was
so thoughtful of you.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.992
My mother made it
when Will was born and--

09:52.025 --> 09:54.161
Don't let the Pierre Cardin
label fool you.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.964
He sewed it in
when he was eight.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.002
I'm so touched.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.003
It's been
dry cleaned, right?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.672
Oh, are you kidding?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.139
If this one didn't see it
come back once a week

10:06.173 --> 10:08.942
folded over a hanger,
he cried and cried.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.145
Wait a minute.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.748
You gave Sam
his baby blanket.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.849
And you gave Paul his.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
But you're giving mine
to Grace?

10:17.985 --> 10:18.919
What do you want
to do with it?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.888
Let it sit in the attic
for another 40 years.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.155
Whenever Will was upset,

10:22.189 --> 10:25.859
he would clutch that blanket
to his chest.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.060
Oh, sweet.
Thank you, George.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.996
This way it stays
in the family.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.264
Yeah. Sort of.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.766
Let's eat, huh?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.901
It kinda smells
like Drakkar Noir.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.902
Oh, he slept on it

10:34.935 --> 10:36.937
well into junior high.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.181
Thanks for taking me
to this dance club, Karen.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.818
You know, get my mind off of
not auditioning.
Oh.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.820
I don't know
about this place.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.688
It's kind of lame.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.789
No music.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.824
There's no lights.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.358
There's no bar.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.960
These losers look like
they'd go home

10:59.993 --> 11:02.229
with any buck-toothed fool.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.464
Hey, Adam.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.201
Hey, Ken.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.369
Jack McFarland?

11:09.402 --> 11:10.804
Is Jack McFarland here?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.907
I'm Jack McFarland.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.943
Your audition's next.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.444
What?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.347
They think I'm gonna audition
to be at this club?

11:20.380 --> 11:21.381
Jackie, how stupid
are you?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.750
This is your audition.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.384
I tricked you.
Look around!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.723
I can't believe you, Karen.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.158
I said
I wouldn't do this.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.727
Jack--

11:33.761 --> 11:35.963
I'm scared.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.297
Of what?

11:37.330 --> 11:40.500
It's only acting,
for God's sake.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.269
I mean,
how hard can it be?

11:42.302 --> 11:45.205
Kate Beckinsale
can do it.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.275
You know what
you're scared of?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.243
You're scared
of doing something

11:50.277 --> 11:51.745
on your own
for once in your life.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.314
I mean it, Jackie.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.348
Whether it's me
paying your rent

11:55.382 --> 11:57.450
or Will
paying your bills.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.286
Or Zandra helping you out
with your auditions,

11:59.319 --> 12:00.320
it's always something.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.521
And you know what, honey?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.391
It was cute
when you were younger.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.526
It's not cute anymore.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.762
Karen.

12:08.796 --> 12:09.997
Don't Karen me.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.999
For years now,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.401
I've watched you flip
from career to career

12:14.434 --> 12:15.468
and you always
come back to this.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.469
And you know why?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.505
Because this
is the only thing

12:18.538 --> 12:21.308
that you have ever
really cared about.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.810
And now--

12:22.843 --> 12:25.545
It's the only thing
you've got, Jackie.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.783
So, when they
call your name,

12:29.817 --> 12:35.755
you go in there and squeal
like your life depends on it.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.792
Because honey--

12:38.826 --> 12:40.794
It does.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.463
This is it, Jackie.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.932
You've run out
of options.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.233
Jack McFarland--

12:46.266 --> 12:47.234
We're waiting.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.237
Break a leg, Jack.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.014
Why are you
washing dishes?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.015
We haven't
even had dessert.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.052
There is dessert, right?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.289
We had dessert.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.958
That cheese
and fig thing?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.862
Uh, WASPS.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.331
What's wrong with you?

13:18.365 --> 13:22.335
You've had it
all through dinner.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.536
Is this about
the blanket?

13:23.570 --> 13:24.838
Yes. Of course it's
about the blanket.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.473
I don't want
to discuss it.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.008
I certainly don't want
to discuss it with them.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.309
I am stuffed.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.344
Uh, boy. Me too.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.046
I, uh--I'm just going to go
gas up the car.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.047
I'll be back
in about five minutes.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.148
You and your rituals.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.417
You always have to fill
the tank right after dinner.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.418
Where you going?
Burrito place.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.486
Get me two.
You got it.

13:39.519 --> 13:43.556
Will, you want to go for a ride
with the old man?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.092
No thanks.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.094
You okay?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.495
I'm good.

13:48.528 --> 13:53.033
Really? You barely said
two words at dinner.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.868
You want two words?

13:54.902 --> 13:55.936
Fine. I'll give you
two words.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.405
My blanket.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.007
Now what does
that mean?

14:00.040 --> 14:03.010
Are you upset
I gave the blanket to Grace?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.913
I'm upset that you didn't
save it for me.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.014
What do you want to do?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.481
You still want to sleep
with that thing?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.484
You know he slept with it
for so long

14:11.518 --> 14:12.519
I finally had
to tell him

14:12.552 --> 14:15.555
a black man robbed us
and took it.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.425
Only now, I realize
really how awful that sounds.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.928
I mean today I would
just say a man.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.663
Arab man.

14:23.696 --> 14:29.136
I want my blanket so that
I can give it to my baby.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.539
Since when are you
gonna have a baby?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.908
I'm not,
but I might one day.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.576
Didn't occur to me.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.810
There's a shocker.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.547
It didn't occur to you that
your gay son might have kids.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.581
Now what does
that mean?

14:41.614 --> 14:42.749
You wanna have kids,
have kids.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.452
You know, I've got a bunch
of blankets up in the attic.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.686
You know what?
I could take any one of those.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.455
And then Will,
you can have this one back.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.057
That's not what this
is about, Grace.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.658
It's about my father,
after all these years,

14:51.691 --> 14:54.928
just assuming that I'm not
gonna have kids because I'm gay.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.364
Will, aren't you being
a little dramatic?

14:57.397 --> 14:58.398
Well that's what we gays do,
isn't it?

14:58.431 --> 15:01.368
Get overly dramatic?

15:03.136 --> 15:06.073
Here we are,
back in the gay minefield.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.409
The flowers are prettier,
but the bombs are still there.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.644
You think
this is funny?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.213
No, I think it's frustrating
that every time

15:13.246 --> 15:15.382
you got a problem with me,
it's because you're gay.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.484
That's because me being gay
is the problem.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.485
It's always
been the problem.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.619
You keep saying
you've accepted it,

15:19.652 --> 15:22.422
but everything you do
makes it obvious you haven't.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.623
How dare you talk--
Who wants dessert?

15:23.656 --> 15:24.591
to me like that?

15:24.624 --> 15:27.394
After all I've done
to accept who you are.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.129
All you've done?
Wow. Is it that much work?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.964
He was trying to do something
nice for me.
Grace--

15:30.998 --> 15:32.732
Please stay out of this.
You know what?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.135
I don't need to stay here
and have this conversation.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.436
No, dad--
We are finishing this.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.005
Please, Will.
Just stop this.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.006
No, he doesn't want
to stop.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.507
I think
he's enjoying this.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.510
You think I enjoy having
a father who's ashamed of me?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.412
Don't you put words
in my mouth.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.713
I never said
I was ashamed of you.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.880
Then answer me this--

15:47.914 --> 15:50.717
Would you or would you not
prefer that I was straight?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.751
Will, enough.
No.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.054
I want to hear him say it.
What?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
Do I think your life
would be easier?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.757
Do I think
you'd be happier?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.758
So that's a yes?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.227
I didn't say prefer.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.428
No, but that's
what you mean.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.529
You're just not saying
the words.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.997
Fine. You want the words?

16:04.031 --> 16:07.667
Yes. I'd prefer
you weren't gay.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.773
Well, thanks.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.143
Come on, Grace.
Oh please. Don't go, Will.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.045
Not like this.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.519
Well, um--

16:27.620 --> 16:31.058
Thanks for the blanket.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.633
Say there--

16:40.667 --> 16:44.071
You look like a cute little
out of work gay boy.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.674
I don't suppose
you'd be interested

16:47.707 --> 16:49.509
in hopping around
for pocket change

16:49.542 --> 16:51.478
and answering
to the name poodle?

16:51.511 --> 16:55.615
Hmm. Do I get to play
with those?

16:59.186 --> 17:02.589
Of course.

17:02.622 --> 17:07.060
And thank you
for noticing.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.561
Do you have a card?

17:08.595 --> 17:09.796
I already have
one of you,

17:09.829 --> 17:12.499
but I think I may have
destroyed him.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.569
[gasp]
Honey, how'd it go?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.605
How'd it go?

17:18.638 --> 17:21.074
Thanks to you,
I blew it.

17:21.108 --> 17:25.112
Well, whatever it takes
to get the part.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.219
No. I was so overwhelmed
by what you said,

17:32.252 --> 17:33.853
I almost didn't
get the words out.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.589
I didn't do any
of my trademark moves.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.726
Like sad puppy.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.229
Or dream state.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.267
I didn't even
indicate distance.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.270
I just said the line
like a nothing.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.872
You couldn't even
tell I was acting.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.841
I was just natural
and unforced.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.810
Like I wasn't
even me. Like--

17:57.844 --> 17:58.845
I became this whole other person
or character.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.547
It was awful.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.252
I've absolutely no flair
for the dramatic.

18:05.285 --> 18:10.590
Dear God,
whatever will become of me?

18:10.623 --> 18:14.794
Well, don't worry, honey.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.828
You'll be fine.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.130
Because you tried.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.765
So you didn't
get this part.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.200
You'll get
the next one.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.169
I'm really
proud of you.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.771
Jack McFarland?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.306
I know, I know.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.208
I didn't get the part
of the Squealing Queen.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.876
No, you didn't.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.745
You got the part
of Detective Chuck Rafferdy.

18:32.779 --> 18:37.384
Chuck Rafferdy?

18:39.652 --> 18:40.820
The straight, angry cop
with a drinking problem

18:40.853 --> 18:42.155
who beats on his wife?

18:42.189 --> 18:44.791
And they say
the sitcom is dead.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.327
I can't believe it.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.330
But that's one
of the leads.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.631
How is this possible?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.900
They said you
just were Chuck Rafferdy--

18:53.933 --> 18:55.302
A devastated narcissist

18:55.335 --> 18:58.338
careening toward
a dismal future.

18:59.639 --> 19:04.877
Okay, now I know
I'm good

19:04.911 --> 19:07.647
because I don't even know
half of those words.

19:10.883 --> 19:15.655
I know
it's been two days.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.424
When are you gonna
talk to your dad?

19:17.457 --> 19:19.426
And talk about what?

19:19.459 --> 19:21.194
I'm still gay.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.295
I have no good news
for him.

19:22.329 --> 19:26.199
Well, he obviously has something
he wants to say to you

19:26.233 --> 19:28.868
'cause he's left you
like six messages.

19:28.901 --> 19:29.902
I'll call him later.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.871
I'm not ready yet.
Not now.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.341
Can we just
sit here awhile?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.909
Sure.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.216
Oh look it--look at that.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.985
The baby kicked.

19:46.018 --> 19:46.953
It's happened
a couple of times now.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.689
It's amazing.
I know.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.958
She's gonna be
a soccer player.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.262
Or he's gonna be
a Rockette.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.996
[phone ringing]

19:57.029 --> 19:59.232
Oh, my God.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.236
It's your dad.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.771
Come on. You have
to talk to him. Please?

20:04.804 --> 20:07.807
Just--Come on.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.847
Hey, dad.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.249
Hi, mom.

20:16.283 --> 20:19.386
Oh, my God.
Where are you?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.788
I'll be right there.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.790
I love you, too.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.394
Will?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.262
My dad had
a heart attack.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.464
Oh, my God.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.999
Are they
at the hospital?

20:33.032 --> 20:35.802
Yeah.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.337
But he didn't make it.

20:38.971 --> 20:39.038
