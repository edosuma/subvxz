<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:03.436 --> 00:04.801
Were you thinking about college?

00:04.871 --> 00:06.566
-It can wait.
-For what?

00:06.673 --> 00:09.233
He's in shock now that you're officially
off the market.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.675
-It's true, Dim. Haley's preggers.
-Brooke!

00:11.745 --> 00:14.612
The Phoenix effect isn't uncommon
in cardiac patients.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.981
They grow remorseful, introspective,
sometimes even joyous.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.952
I've decided to run the dealership for Dan.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.582
You've given up a lot for Dan.
He doesn't deserve a brother like you.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.318
Actually, he deserves better.

00:26.393 --> 00:30.329
We were two lonely people
together for one night.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.293
No one else needs to know.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.856
Don't be a stranger, okay?

00:34.934 --> 00:38.028
-You and Haley still married?
-Yeah, she hasn't thrown me out, yet.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.265
We can take the cameras, put them out...

00:40.340 --> 00:42.274
people can take pictures
for the wedding wall.

00:42.409 --> 00:46.106
I will not give you my blessing
for destroying my son's life...

00:46.179 --> 00:49.546
or, and you can trust me on this,
your own.

00:49.616 --> 00:52.608
I remember the person
that you used to be.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.846
Why not just be him again?

00:55.221 --> 00:59.419
Would you ask Lucas to drop by?
I'd really like to see your brother.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.830
I think it needs
to come down on the left some.

01:47.907 --> 01:51.934
-No, it's gotta come down on the right.
-Our left is your right.

01:52.545 --> 01:54.172
Then why are we arguing?

01:54.247 --> 01:58.411
Nathan, what do you think?
Thai, Mexican? Chinese is always good.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.881
Tim, you just ate.
How is it possible you're still hungry?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.651
I'm not ordering food.
I'm ordering strippers.

02:06.292 --> 02:10.092
What? You guys got married so fast,
I got screwed out of being the best man.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.631
And I am not getting screwed out
of a bachelor party.

02:12.699 --> 02:15.167
I was going to be the best man, right?

02:15.235 --> 02:18.432
-He's like a dog with a bone, Hales.
-Great. Let's get him neutered.

02:18.505 --> 02:22.066
Come on, Haley. It's just a stripper.
It's harmless fun.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.042
You know, Tim's right.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.502
See? Fun!

02:27.947 --> 02:30.609
Yes, but so much more fun
when you haven't seen it before.

02:30.683 --> 02:31.775
Nice.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.209
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.213
Haley, let the boys have their fun.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.960
Besides, what's good for the goose
is even better for you.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.087
They can have
their little testosterone-fest...

02:44.164 --> 02:46.997
ogle some dial-a-date.
And you get to have a bridal shower...

02:47.066 --> 02:50.502
and rake in loot from all the guests.
This is so a fair trade.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.765
I so don't need loot.

02:52.839 --> 02:57.242
-Okay, Sunny Hill Lodge?
-It's kitschy.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.471
So is this thing.

03:00.146 --> 03:04.105
No. That is a bridal shower code red.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.549
I'm on it.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.690
-I'm glad you came, Son.
-You wanted to see me?

03:21.134 --> 03:25.468
Yes, I did. I want to do something
I should have done a long time ago.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.498
I want to apologize to you
and to your mother.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.070
I'm sorry, Lucas, for everything.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.413
-You okay?
-I went to go see Dan.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.981
-I'm not gonna hide from him, you know.
-Yeah, I know.

03:48.461 --> 03:51.453
-How did it go?
-He freaked me out.

03:52.098 --> 03:54.123
What did he say this time?

03:54.534 --> 03:58.095
That he was sorry.
You know, the scary part...

03:59.072 --> 04:00.699
was that it seemed like he meant it.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.936
Do you want me to go talk to him,
maybe go see him with you?

04:04.010 --> 04:08.276
No. I'm okay.
I'm just not gonna run from him anymore.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.584
Sometimes you just gotta let it go.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.385
You could've told me about the strippers,
instead of ambushing Haley with it.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.191
-You knew about it.
-I knew you were talking about it.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.665
I didn't know you were gonna order them
in front of my wife.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.760
Did you get married or castrated? Fine.

04:31.771 --> 04:35.332
You want me to cancel the stripper,
tell the boys it's off?

04:35.408 --> 04:36.773
-No.
-See...

04:36.843 --> 04:39.641
you're just as excited as I am.
I know you, man.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.878
Whatever.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.009
You're telling me this girl shows up,
all hot and willing, you wouldn't go there?

04:46.085 --> 04:48.246
-Tim, I'm married.
-Right.

04:48.888 --> 04:53.587
Keep telling yourself that. But that ring
doesn't erase your past, Nate.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.726
Some of us still remember
who you used to be.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.436
<i>Parts department,pick up line four.</i>

05:17.183 --> 05:20.448
Looking sharp. You settling in okay?

05:22.255 --> 05:25.588
Typical Dan. He did everything himself.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.627
Never let anyone help him
with the big stuff.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.861
-Anything I can do to help?
-Yeah.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.990
You can come back and work for me,
like old times. What do you say?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.592
Well, I would say, ''Thank you,''
but I don't know.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.832
It might be a little strange getting a check
with Dan's name on it.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.602
No. Actually, it feels pretty good.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.007
Well, the job's yours if you want it.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.275
Thanks, Keith.
You know, I'll let you get back to work.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.044
That's exactly what I've been avoiding.

05:51.250 --> 05:56.051
I have to get Dan's signature on these,
and despite my best efforts...

05:56.122 --> 05:58.352
I'm all out of excuses not to.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.291
Are you guys still having problems?

06:02.462 --> 06:03.861
Actually, no.

06:04.263 --> 06:07.630
I don't know what drugs they're pumping
him full of, but he's kind of...

06:07.700 --> 06:10.225
-polite.
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.363
I didn't think that we'd be able
to put aside our differences...

06:13.439 --> 06:15.566
like you and Nathan have. But...

06:16.042 --> 06:19.011
who knows?
Maybe they'll keep him medicated.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.169
This is Keith.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.145
Okay. I'll be right there.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.185
I gotta run.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.347
You know, if you want...

06:33.292 --> 06:36.420
-I can take those papers to the hospital.
-Are you sure?

06:38.030 --> 06:40.498
Yeah. No problem.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.730
-AII right. I'll see you.
-Okay.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.675
-Need some help?
-Nope.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.581
Just straightening up for your party.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.876
Haley, you don't need to. It's just the guys.

07:00.953 --> 07:04.389
They've seen it like this.
In fact, they made it like this.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.152
I don't mind.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.716
Besides, if we're gonna have a skanky ho
in the place...

07:08.795 --> 07:10.729
at least it should look nice.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.493
I'm kidding. Sort of. Maybe.

07:13.833 --> 07:17.462
Haley, this bachelor party
is more for Tim than it is for me, okay?

07:17.537 --> 07:20.404
He's threatened by the fact
that Lucas threw us a reception...

07:20.473 --> 07:22.964
so this is his way of proving
he's still my best friend.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.977
Yeah, what's next?
Lap dances for world peace?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.875
I'm not all tweaked about your shower.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.906
It's a bridal shower, Nathan!
It's gonna be the most boring thing ever.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.043
Your shower is going to totally kill.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.023
-Normally, killing is not good, so--
-Nope, but this time it is. Eyes forward.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.350
What's that for?

07:40.426 --> 07:42.417
Don't worry about it.
Leave the shower to me.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.487
I'm gonna teach Haley James, Scott...

07:45.565 --> 07:48.193
whoever you are right now,
how to have some serious fun.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.565
Tomorrow night, I'm Tutor Girl.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.631
Hey.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.344
Hi, Karen.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.842
You look fantastic. It's a whole new you.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.583
Yeah. Thanks.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.922
So how are things going at the dealership?

08:13.726 --> 08:17.025
Good. I think it's gonna be okay.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.890
Good.

08:23.870 --> 08:28.170
You know what? I better be getting back.
See you around.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.870
Okay.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.355
Good to see you, Lucas.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.052
Keith needs some signatures from you.

08:53.966 --> 08:57.060
<i>Portable x-ray</i>
<i>to nurse's station Four West.</i>

09:02.341 --> 09:04.070
You know, I was thinking.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.141
My doctor's putting me
through cardiovascular rehab.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.738
I thought you might like to join me.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.916
So you want to be workout buddies?

09:12.985 --> 09:17.012
It would be a good chance
to spend time together, get to know you.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.457
You had my whole life to do that.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.789
Well, life's given me a second chance.
Maybe you will, too.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.633
Do you think
we'd even be having this conversation...

09:29.702 --> 09:32.068
if you weren't on the outs with Nathan?

09:32.338 --> 09:35.671
That's not it.
But I understand your trepidation.

09:38.444 --> 09:43.040
I know I haven't exactly given you
a lot of reasons to trust me in the past.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.550
Look, would you do me a favor,
and put a copy of this in the lockbox...

09:49.622 --> 09:53.786
in my bottom desk drawer? There's a key
taped underneath the drawer.

09:55.895 --> 09:56.987
Yeah.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.159
Lucas.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.000
You might not trust me, but I trust you.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.608
My nose is starting to itch.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.153
-AII right.
-Hi. Am I interrupting something?

11:28.220 --> 11:31.383
-Hi, Haley.
-Hi. This is some weird guy thing...

11:31.457 --> 11:32.856
I'm never gonna understand, right?

11:32.925 --> 11:34.051
-Pretty much.
-Great.

11:34.126 --> 11:38.085
Well, at least I came to the right place.
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:38.297 --> 11:39.389
Yeah.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.058
We gotta go get eggs anyway.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.162
-Let's roll.
-Eggs?

11:44.737 --> 11:46.204
So what's up?

11:49.775 --> 11:51.299
Yo, Fergie!

11:53.345 --> 11:54.369
Sorry.

11:54.447 --> 11:58.747
How about you roll me down the street,
and see if you can hit me on the fly?

12:02.788 --> 12:05.382
So you know about
this whole bachelor party thing, right?

12:05.458 --> 12:08.154
Haley, look. It's just goofy guy stuff, okay?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.890
I know. I just wish he'd done
his goofy guy stuff before we got married.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.297
He would have if you'd
have gotten married 10 years from now.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.325
Joking. Sorry.

12:18.838 --> 12:22.296
Would you just look after him?

12:24.143 --> 12:27.442
I'll tell you what. I will sacrifice myself...

12:28.214 --> 12:31.115
and go to the bachelor party
to take care of Nathan.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.080
You're so heroic.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.953
Thank you.

12:36.055 --> 12:39.957
Check it out. We got these trash cans
set up like bowling pins, right?

12:40.025 --> 12:43.825
So I figure we just gonna roll Mouth's
squirrelly little ass right on into them.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.126
I so got next.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.593
Medication will treat the symptoms...

12:50.669 --> 12:54.867
but the best treatment for you now
is a radical lifestyle change.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.171
So we're gonna put you
on a physical therapy regimen...

12:58.244 --> 13:01.702
and you can start that as soon
as you're released the day after tomorrow.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.306
So what are we talking about, Doc?
Weights? Treadmill?

13:04.383 --> 13:08.285
More like some stretching, short walks.

13:08.554 --> 13:11.751
You have to understand, Dan.
You're looking at a long road back.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.850
And the road is called the rest of your life.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.499
The hospital gave me the name
of their best physical therapist.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.900
And there's also a nurse who can move in
with you at the beach house.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.962
I want to come home, Deb.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.848
-Dude, smell me.
-Dude, kiss my ass.

13:36.916 --> 13:40.613
Seriously, I want to smell nice
for the talent that's coming over later.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.587
-Tim, just say ''the stripper.''
-Fine, the stripper.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.681
AII right,
which one makes me smell available?

13:45.758 --> 13:49.216
I've got Flesh on this side
and this French stuff on this side.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.529
-That's not mine.
-Well it was in your bathroom.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.533
Tim, what are you doing
with my perfume?

13:56.302 --> 13:58.065
AII right, I am off.

13:59.305 --> 14:03.435
AII the important numbers are
by the phone: police, fire, pimps.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.272
-Thanks for worrying about us.
-I'm not worried about you.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.870
Have your fun. Just remember...

14:10.783 --> 14:12.375
you're married now.

14:12.451 --> 14:15.284
She's here. Stripper time.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.046
It's just you.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.555
Not the thrill it used to be?

14:22.027 --> 14:23.221
Hi.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.797
Okay, I left some $1s on the counter,
in case you don't have any change.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.268
Don't spend it all in one place.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.502
What's wrong with Dim?

14:37.576 --> 14:41.273
Don't take it personally.
He thought you were the stripper.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.709
We prefer to be called exotic dancers.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.045
Nice.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.614
-Who the hell are you?
-Where's the stripper?

14:59.031 --> 15:03.968
I cannot believe you rented this
for my shower. Brooke, this is crazy.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.428
And by ''crazy,'' she means, thank you.

15:06.505 --> 15:10.236
Yeah, God. Brooke, thank you.
I'm blown away by all this.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.668
You're welcome.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.805
I think someone feels a little guilty
about the whole pregnancy rumor.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.840
Well, water under the bridge.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.250
-Forget the water. Let's have champagne.
-Yes.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.652
Champagne?
How much is that gonna cost?

15:23.722 --> 15:26.589
Who cares? It's on my dad's credit card.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.116
I don't know, you guys.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.253
The last time I drank,
I threw up in Dan's lap, and....

15:33.699 --> 15:36.327
-Give it to me.
-That's my girl.

15:36.402 --> 15:40.839
AII right.
A toast to a nice, normal bridal shower.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.271
To nice.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.706
And normal.

15:49.682 --> 15:54.051
-What's that?
-It's just a nice and normal blindfold.

15:54.420 --> 15:58.049
-For what?
-For the nice, normal guest of honor.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.795
-You sure you know this guy?
-He works with me at Hot & Twisted.

16:11.503 --> 16:15.564
-Great. Even losers don't know me.
-Just read the damn quiz.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.169
''When your boyfriend kisses you, he, A--''

16:20.312 --> 16:22.837
-What the hell are you reading?
<i>-COSMOgirl!</i>

16:23.515 --> 16:24.880
Keep going.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.713
''When your boyfriend kisses you, he...''

16:26.785 --> 16:28.810
''A: Looks deeply into your eyes.''

16:28.887 --> 16:30.718
''B: Closes his eyes.''

16:30.789 --> 16:33.349
''C: Cradles your head softly.''

16:33.425 --> 16:35.120
''D: Unhooks your bra.''

16:35.194 --> 16:37.890
It's D. It's definitely D. You go for the bra.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.989
Now Tim, you realize you're supposed
to be answering as a girl.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.229
I know. And I'd want a boyfriend
who isn't afraid to go up my shirt.

16:44.303 --> 16:47.864
-And hopefully someday you'll find him.
-Okay, this sucks.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.134
What kind of bachelor party is this?

16:50.209 --> 16:52.109
No booze, no strippers.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.912
I thought you guys had the best parties.
This is lame.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.972
My brother's setting up the stripper,
so we won't be disappointed.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.950
I just hope the stripper's not a guy.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.283
I remember the last time you were
on stripper duty.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.881
AII right, I wasn't gonna crack this out
until later, but what the hell.

17:05.958 --> 17:10.190
Let's set the mood with a little something
from my dad's porno stash.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.693
I was up late one night
and I heard my dad watching this.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.102
-The chick in it goes absolutely nuts.
-Sweet.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.013
<i>Oh, honey. Oh, baby.</i>

17:32.484 --> 17:35.180
-Tim, is that your mom?
-Step mom.

17:36.955 --> 17:40.118
-Dude, your mom's a slut!
-Step mom.

17:44.196 --> 17:48.064
-Can you see?
-What is going on, you guys?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.334
What is this?

17:54.406 --> 17:58.775
This is a lingerie fashion show, girlie.
We figured since you're married now...

17:58.844 --> 18:01.904
you need to wear something
a little less conservative for Nathan.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.880
Something a little more....

18:03.949 --> 18:05.246
-Slutty.
-That's it.

18:05.317 --> 18:06.511
No.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.776
Hit it, girls.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.215
Sugar and spice.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.156
Look, that's cute.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.249
Nice.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.054
Go, Bevin.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.057
Oh, my gosh.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.397
Go, Charlotte.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.505
-That's hot!
-Very sexy.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.769
Yeah, Theresa. I call that red hot.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.782
Okay.

18:44.156 --> 18:45.851
How did you....

18:45.924 --> 18:50.088
After all the money that I've spent
in this place, they owed me a few favors.

19:01.907 --> 19:05.866
Want some coffee?
It's not the fancy competition, but....

19:06.612 --> 19:08.580
I love your coffee, Karen. You know that.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.275
So it's not the coffee you're avoiding.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.651
I'm just...

19:15.721 --> 19:18.315
having a hard time
being around you right now.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.950
But before the proposal
we were friends, Keith.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.962
I mean, can't we at least try
to go back to the way we were then?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.691
I don't think so.

19:27.933 --> 19:31.562
You know,
sometimes it's just better to move on.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.464
Kind of like you did with Peyton's dad.

19:35.674 --> 19:40.008
I haven't seen Larry in ages.
You know there's nothing there.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.979
But even if there was,
I mean, your idea of moving on....

19:43.048 --> 19:45.949
Does it mean cutting me out
of your life completely?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.411
I don't want to.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.518
And I have to.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.434
Haley, are you coming out, kitten?

20:05.504 --> 20:07.472
-I am not coming out.
-Come on out, Hales.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.702
See, if you don't come out,
then we're coming in.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.008
-The schoolgirl look.
-I don't know.

20:18.150 --> 20:22.086
Nathan Scott is going to blow a fuse
when he sees you in this.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.116
You guys,
there is no way I can pull this off.

20:25.190 --> 20:30.184
No. Actually, I'd leave that up to Nathan,
especially after our next stop.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.328
Man, I still can't believe
you pulled off this keg, dog.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.994
Well, you can thank Brooke
and the fake ID she made me.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.335
-Tell the truth. You get with that, or what?
-A gentleman never tells.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.603
-Man, that's just Mouth for ''No.''
-Come on.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.645
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

20:51.850 --> 20:54.842
What is wrong
with youth of America today?

20:56.221 --> 20:59.213
-Time to protect and serve.
-Let's go.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.162
Okay, everybody.

21:12.237 --> 21:16.503
This is a very important moment
in our little Haley's life.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.840
The moment
when she becomes a woman...

21:20.579 --> 21:24.310
at least,
according to the State of North Dakota.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.251
It's your very first fake ID.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.914
Trudy Gill? I get it: Tutor Girl.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.820
Why are we stopping?

21:34.893 --> 21:38.420
What do you mean it's going to take
at least an hour to send somebody out?

21:38.497 --> 21:41.557
Let me explain to you
the law of supply and demand:

21:41.633 --> 21:43.191
If I supply the credit card...

21:43.268 --> 21:46.203
I get to demand that you get
somebody out here to fix the car!

21:46.271 --> 21:48.671
-Brooke, I really.... I can just call Lucas.
-No!

21:48.740 --> 21:51.368
-I already tried. His phone's off.
-AII right.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.710
Good.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.517
There you go.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.453
-What seems to be the trouble?
-It's probably the engine.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.789
-I see exactly what the trouble is.
-Great. Can you fix it?

22:12.064 --> 22:14.965
Sure. I've got a tool that can fix anything.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.810
I am gonna kill you.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.813
Nice performance, Cameron Diaz.

22:33.151 --> 22:34.812
You, too, Gwyneth.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.518
That's gotta be the stripper.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.292
Sweet. They're in costume.

22:42.728 --> 22:45.219
Did my brother deliver, or what?

22:45.697 --> 22:50.157
We witnessed a keg being brought up
to this apartment. Are you boys of age?

22:50.235 --> 22:52.396
-In our prime.
-Let's see some ID.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.803
Let's see some hot girl-on-girl.

22:56.441 --> 22:58.739
Damn, these strippers are strong.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.407
I can feel your breasts against my back.

23:02.481 --> 23:06.440
Better yet, forget the keg. Arrest the perv.

23:07.352 --> 23:10.913
You're hurting me. Does that cost extra?

23:23.335 --> 23:24.859
The moon roof.

23:36.648 --> 23:40.106
-Officer, there's been a misunderstanding.
-He thought you were a stripper.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.881
I can see your thong strap, Foxy Brown.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.585
-Never mind.
-Yeah, take him.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.867
I've never been so horny!

24:05.444 --> 24:07.742
Hey, its girls gone wild!

24:12.484 --> 24:13.678
Haley?

24:21.760 --> 24:23.785
Sorry, we're closed.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.626
Is everything all right? Is Dan okay?

24:29.734 --> 24:31.895
The doctors are ready to release him.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.097
-That's good news.
-Yeah.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.842
Let me grab some coffee.

24:38.443 --> 24:42.243
-Dan says he wants to come home.
-Let me grab some liquor.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.417
I'm confused.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.316
I thought the divorce went through.

24:52.557 --> 24:56.891
Technically, no. Dan had the heart attack
before signing the papers.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.487
While signing the papers, actually.

25:00.832 --> 25:04.461
You know, Dan has a team of doctors
who are taking care of him.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.527
Who's taking care of you?

25:07.772 --> 25:10.673
Right now,
whoever's name is on that bottle.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.912
-Maybe the heart attack is a sign.
-It is a sign.

25:16.982 --> 25:20.315
It's a sign that you've gotta stop
doing what's best for Dan...

25:20.385 --> 25:22.853
and start doing what's best for you.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.388
Maybe it's moving on.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.323
Maybe it's trying
to put the pieces back together.

25:27.392 --> 25:31.226
But either way,
do it because it's right for you.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.643
Come on!

25:48.346 --> 25:51.315
If I wanted a lap dance,
I would have stayed home.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.476
No, tonight's going to be a little different.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.180
I rented out the back room
and hired an instructor.

25:56.254 --> 25:57.949
An instructor for what?

25:59.090 --> 26:01.581
Stripping is not just about
taking your clothes off.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.720
It's about getting in touch
with your own body.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.757
And once you do that,
you're gonna find an inner confidence...

26:09.301 --> 26:12.532
that you never had before.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.466
I think you'll be amazed
at just how empowering it is.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.472
-Clearly.
-So where's Haley?

26:21.212 --> 26:23.339
She's not gonna go for this.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.384
Haley, just take it nice and easy.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.246
Show me the pole.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.282
Haley!

26:31.556 --> 26:33.581
That's gonna leave a mark.

26:34.559 --> 26:35.583
Oh, my God.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.859
So, look. I know...

26:38.930 --> 26:42.263
we haven't taken the training wheels
off this whole brother thing.

26:42.334 --> 26:46.703
But I want to ask you something.
I went down to the dealership today...

26:46.771 --> 26:51.037
-and I found some pictures.
-The ones of you in his desk.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.534
You know about those?

26:53.612 --> 26:57.241
Yeah, it's part of the reason I hated you
all those years.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.683
He said he wants me
to help him with his rehab.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.655
And what did you say?

27:06.925 --> 27:09.723
I said I wouldn't be a stand-in Nathan.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.685
-Night, man.
-Take it easy.

27:11.763 --> 27:12.957
AII right, guys.

27:13.031 --> 27:15.625
Yeah, we should probably go bail Tim out.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.396
-Looks like we got Timmed again.
-Yeah.

27:18.603 --> 27:21.629
-You might as well head out, too, man.
-You sure?

27:21.706 --> 27:23.230
Yeah, don't worry about it.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.869
You know what?
Actually, I have something for you.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.318
It's for your new job.

27:36.521 --> 27:40.355
Keith needs some help at the dealership.
And he's a good boss and I figure...

27:40.425 --> 27:43.656
it pays better
than what you're making now, right?

27:44.462 --> 27:46.089
Thank you, man.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.727
-Later.
-AII right.

27:49.801 --> 27:50.961
Hey, Lucas.

27:52.570 --> 27:56.939
Look, I understand if you have to find out
about Dan yourself.

27:57.642 --> 28:01.373
Whatever you decide to do,
it's not gonna affect you and me.

28:01.913 --> 28:05.747
He's come between us before.
Let's just not let it happen again.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.717
Thanks, man.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.564
Excuse me, Miss Davis.
Your credit card's been declined.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.142
Thank you.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.747
Well, then. Looks like we have a problem.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.087
So what's your policy on IOUs?

28:58.503 --> 29:01.700
You must be Nathan. I'm Simone.
Sorry I'm late.

29:01.773 --> 29:05.174
No, that's okay.
But the party's actually over.

29:05.243 --> 29:08.474
I don't think so.
The party's just getting started.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.719
Wild night?

29:18.556 --> 29:20.490
More like a long night.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.160
I hope it's not too late
to give you your show.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.559
Thanks, but it's okay.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.163
You sure? I'm already paid for.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.903
No, I think I'm good.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.536
Or at least you're trying to be.

29:37.075 --> 29:40.875
-It's fine. I can call a cab to pick me up.
-Okay.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.543
In the meantime...

29:45.350 --> 29:48.547
I have an idea about what we can do
while we wait.

29:50.255 --> 29:54.055
I cannot believe my stupid parents
didn't pay their credit card bill.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.686
We've got $140 in cash at most.
So what are we going to do?

29:58.229 --> 30:00.561
-I'm going to take care of it.
-How?

30:01.099 --> 30:02.225
A little negotiation.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.700
Brooke, you cannot talk your way
out of a $1,000 bill.

30:04.769 --> 30:08.136
Don't be silly. A girl can do anything
she puts her mouth to.

30:11.276 --> 30:14.268
Hi. I was wondering if there might be...

30:14.345 --> 30:16.609
an alternate way to settle this bill.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.375
It's a strip club, honey.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.821
How dirty are you willing to get?

30:31.930 --> 30:34.091
''How dirty are you willing to get?''

30:34.165 --> 30:36.998
Well, I hope this is dirty enough for you.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.801
Here. Drink this.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.270
It'll help you
with your hangover tomorrow.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.865
What's in it?

30:44.943 --> 30:47.173
You don't want to know. Drink up.

30:47.245 --> 30:50.043
You don't want my help
washing the dishes? I totally can.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.844
Absolutely not.
The guest of honor is not doing the dishes.

30:52.917 --> 30:56.580
We're probably gonna be here for a while.
You should just take that limo home.

30:56.654 --> 30:59.384
I think Mrs. Scott's had a long night.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.157
Mrs. Scott.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.856
You guys probably think I'm crazy
for getting married.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.626
No. Well, maybe a little.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.863
You guys totally have the whole
Nick and Jessica thing going on...

31:11.936 --> 31:15.463
just without the stalkerazzi
and the chickeny tuna.

31:16.808 --> 31:20.938
Yeah, I guess I can't really help it
if I found the guy I want to be with...

31:21.012 --> 31:23.674
my first time out.
Isn't that what it's all about?

31:23.748 --> 31:27.206
If we're not out there looking for the one
we want to be with forever...

31:27.285 --> 31:29.082
then what are we doing?

31:30.054 --> 31:31.385
Having fun?

31:31.456 --> 31:34.914
Love is fun. This kind of love is, anyway.

31:36.561 --> 31:40.019
Actually, I'd really like to go home
to my husband, if you don't mind.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.225
-Class dismissed.
-Thank you.

31:43.268 --> 31:46.897
I'm all right.
Thank you so much for tonight.

31:46.971 --> 31:50.065
-Thank you, guys.
-You won't be thanking us tomorrow.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.237
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.440
Come on, Goldilocks. Grime is money.

32:02.654 --> 32:03.780
<i>No good!</i>

32:03.855 --> 32:05.482
I thought you'd be good at this game.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.353
I was going easy on you before.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.791
I'm about to take
the safeties off now, though.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.294
I'm shaking.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.123
Funny. People usually call me
before the wedding.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.269
So what's it like being married?

32:20.571 --> 32:25.531
I love it. And Haley, she's great.
And she's the one for me.

32:26.844 --> 32:28.869
Even if one's all you get?

32:31.316 --> 32:32.578
<i>Nails it!</i>

32:33.151 --> 32:35.119
Game over for you, baby.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.523
Driver? Take me home to my guy.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.746
What are you doing here so late?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.510
You know, I could ask you
that very same thing.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.578
I'm just trying to catch up.
Even though it's Dan Scott Motors...

33:09.654 --> 33:12.384
-I still want to do well, you know?
-Yeah.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.450
-So, what's up?
-Well...

33:16.527 --> 33:19.291
I wanted to thank you for the job offer...

33:19.664 --> 33:22.292
and tell you that I can't accept it.

33:24.969 --> 33:26.197
Okay.

33:27.872 --> 33:32.434
But I offered the job to Nate.
I hope that's okay with you.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.978
Well, I know he could use the cash.

33:35.046 --> 33:38.846
And the guidance, too.
Look, Keith, you've always helped me out.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.218
Now it's Nathan's turn.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.655
-AII right, I'll get out of your way.
-No, you're fine.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.557
I'm just trying
to find those inventory printouts.

33:54.999 --> 33:59.493
How long ago did you call that cab?
I think it should've been here by now.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.599
I have a confession to make.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.332
I didn't call a cab. My car's outside.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.705
You're really cute, Nathan.

34:10.481 --> 34:13.882
You're young. You're athletic.

34:14.819 --> 34:16.514
You suck at video games.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.484
I was paid a lot of money
to show you a good time tonight.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.855
If your idea of a good time...

34:21.926 --> 34:24.554
is getting your butt kicked
by a girl on PlayStation...

34:24.629 --> 34:26.358
I'm fine with that.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.626
But there's also a lot
of other things I'd be fine with.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.496
There's a lot of things
I'm good at, Nathan...

34:36.908 --> 34:39.502
keeping a secret is only one of them.

34:40.844 --> 34:44.212
I'll be in the bedroom.
You decide what you want.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.451
I want you.

35:25.223 --> 35:26.815
God, I love you.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.798
How was the stripper?

35:36.367 --> 35:39.302
Pretty good at <i>NBA Live.</i>

35:40.204 --> 35:43.901
Other than that, I had no interest in her.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.736
I actually had to ask her to leave.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.076
How was the shower?

35:52.650 --> 35:56.882
-It was educational.
-Yeah? What did you learn?

35:58.289 --> 36:02.487
Only what I already knew.
You are the one that I want.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.352
Yeah, me, too.

36:08.232 --> 36:09.927
Where you going?

36:10.001 --> 36:12.697
You know how I said
tonight was educational?

36:12.770 --> 36:15.398
Honey, you're gonna love the homework.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.972
I was thinking about what Haley said.

36:23.814 --> 36:26.908
You know,
how it's all supposed to be for love.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.515
Kind of scary.

36:30.087 --> 36:33.614
Yeah. Do you think she's right?

36:34.125 --> 36:38.027
I know she is.
But that's not the part that scares me.

36:39.664 --> 36:41.256
Then what does?

36:44.202 --> 36:47.660
People are gonna disappoint you,
I get that.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.768
I kind of expect that.

36:50.508 --> 36:54.740
But what if you wake up one day and
realize that you're the disappointment?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.647
What's on your mind, Brooke?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.921
I was just thinking...

37:09.827 --> 37:12.193
about how we're gonna pay for this limo.

37:22.940 --> 37:26.876
I spoke to the lawyer about the situation
with Nathan and Haley.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.606
He says it's going to be a lot tougher
than he thought.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.741
It doesn't look like there's any way
to invalidate their marriage.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.785
-There's nothing we can do?
-Legally.

37:39.624 --> 37:42.889
You look surprised. Why?
Because that's something you would say?

37:42.960 --> 37:45.190
No. I was just thinking...

37:45.263 --> 37:47.788
that maybe we don't have to take
such drastic measures.

37:47.865 --> 37:52.564
Snap out of it, Dan.
Phoenix effect or not, I need some help.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.035
They're teenagers, Deb.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.534
Once the newlywed sex wears off,
they'll realize...

37:57.608 --> 38:00.702
the only thing keeping this marriage afloat
is a minimum-wage job...

38:00.778 --> 38:04.805
pushing pretzels with no benefits.
Then money problems will kick in...

38:04.882 --> 38:08.545
and they'll start to wonder
why they rushed into the whole thing.

38:10.354 --> 38:14.848
Their marriage will probably self-destruct
and we won't even have to lift a finger.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.693
And what if it doesn't?

38:17.795 --> 38:21.128
I had a heart attack, Deb, not a lobotomy.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.772
I thought you had to be at work.

38:28.839 --> 38:31.831
I'm not gonna take the job
at the dealership.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.410
I offered it to Nathan. He needs it more.

38:35.579 --> 38:38.013
And besides,
I'm gonna have my hands full at the cafe.

38:38.082 --> 38:39.344
The cafe?

38:39.417 --> 38:43.444
Well, seeing as you're going to be so busy
with college and classes...

38:43.954 --> 38:47.515
somebody's got to take care of things
at the cafe, right?

38:47.658 --> 38:48.920
Maybe so.

38:55.433 --> 38:56.525
Bye.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.300
Do me a favor.

39:00.571 --> 39:03.472
Don't change when you come home
from work today.

39:04.208 --> 39:07.871
-I'm kind of into the whole mechanic thing.
-No problem, ma'am.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.658
What's going on?

39:24.161 --> 39:25.355
Come on.

40:13.944 --> 40:15.468
I'll be inside.

40:21.786 --> 40:25.347
Those pictures
in the lockbox don't change anything.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.390
Don't even think for a second that they do.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.623
I know I can't change our past, Lucas.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.657
But I'm hoping I can change our future.

41:45.135 --> 41:46.159
