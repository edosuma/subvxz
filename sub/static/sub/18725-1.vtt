00:45.459 --> 00:48.032
Well?

00:48.170 --> 00:51.290
The symbols
are definitely canaanite.

00:51.423 --> 00:54.175
And you can translate them?

00:54.301 --> 00:56.294
Is it the map to...

00:56.429 --> 01:02.052
at first glance, but I shall have
to study it. I shall need time.

01:02.185 --> 01:05.850
That is impossible, professor huston.

01:05.980 --> 01:10.358
- Who the hell is this?
- You will translate it now.

01:10.485 --> 01:13.770
Like hell he will. Come on, professor.

01:16.866 --> 01:18.859
Open this door!

01:18.994 --> 01:21.745
When it is translated.

01:27.044 --> 01:29.083
My door!

01:33.300 --> 01:35.209
Now...

01:35.344 --> 01:37.882
you will translate it,

01:38.013 --> 01:40.006
professor.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.681
- Where is this place, anyway?
- That way.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.775
Then why are we going this way?

02:33.904 --> 02:37.487
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.867
Miss huston, trust me.

02:40.995 --> 02:43.533
It's a jungle out there.

03:13.945 --> 03:17.895
- We lost our shadow.
- What does he mean, "shadow"?

03:18.033 --> 03:20.524
We've been followed
for the past few hours.

03:20.661 --> 03:24.955
- What do you mean, "followed"?
- I mean that we go somewhere

03:25.082 --> 03:28.914
and someone sneaking around
behind us tags right along.

03:29.044 --> 03:32.164
- But why?
- You're more likely to know that than i.

03:32.298 --> 03:34.337
You tell me.

04:05.707 --> 04:08.115
There it is. Tongola.

04:09.002 --> 04:11.042
Umbopo, make camp on that rise.

04:11.171 --> 04:14.256
I come. It is safer
to enter tongola in numbers.

04:14.383 --> 04:17.300
We won't be there long enough
to get in trouble.

04:20.514 --> 04:24.642
- What did umbopo mean, "safer"?
- Tongola's not noted for its hospitality.

04:24.769 --> 04:27.935
Well, then maybe we should
take him with us.

04:28.064 --> 04:31.065
- Maybe they should all come with us.
- Uh-uh.

04:31.192 --> 04:33.861
The trouble in tongola is dogati.

04:33.986 --> 04:37.190
For heaven's sake, sergeant,
stop that dreadful music.

04:37.323 --> 04:40.158
I cannot. Colonel bockner's orders.

04:40.702 --> 04:45.280
Sergeant, if you wish to continue
swallowing, stop the music.

04:46.291 --> 04:51.202
Colonel bockner? Your nauseating
breakfast is getting cold.

04:51.963 --> 04:55.664
Get away. Get away. Go away!

04:57.803 --> 05:00.969
What animals. What filth.

05:01.098 --> 05:03.505
How can you stand this place?

05:03.642 --> 05:06.976
These filthy animals
have been most profitable for me.

05:07.104 --> 05:11.351
Ah, ja. Because you are turkish
and unprincipled. Primitive.

05:11.483 --> 05:14.484
Like this godforsaken country.

05:14.612 --> 05:20.816
You don't even appreciate good music.
This was wagner, you turkish imbecile.

05:22.954 --> 05:25.789
You realise I'm getting impatient?

05:25.915 --> 05:28.999
Very impatient.
So is the german reich and the army.

05:29.127 --> 05:33.789
- The german occupation of africa...
- be silent! I too am growing impatient!

05:33.923 --> 05:38.466
Of your pompous preening,
you knackwurst-eating hypocrite.

05:38.595 --> 05:40.089
Imbecile.

05:57.364 --> 05:58.942
Our welcoming committee.

05:59.074 --> 06:02.526
- Mr stealth is still hot on our trail.
- What does he want?

06:02.661 --> 06:05.235
Someone doesn't want you
to find your father.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.199
There.

06:16.676 --> 06:20.887
I have seen her. She has come
into the city. Quatermain is with her.

06:22.098 --> 06:24.340
Quatermain.

06:24.475 --> 06:29.387
Well, here we are in beautiful tongola,
so I think it's time you levelled with me.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.978
Levelled with you? I don't understand.

06:32.108 --> 06:34.860
You've been holding out on me
since the beginning.

06:34.986 --> 06:40.526
We want the route to the mines, dogati.
The mines. Quatermain is no problem.

06:40.659 --> 06:44.277
So stop quivering at the mention
of his name, you turkish coward.

06:44.413 --> 06:49.240
I have a problem with quatermain.
He considers himself a man of principle.

06:49.376 --> 06:53.588
And like you, he objects to my meagre
existence in this miserable town.

06:53.714 --> 06:59.053
So what? He will be no problem
for germany. We will simply kill him.

07:04.016 --> 07:06.092
- Prisoners?
- Slaves.

07:06.227 --> 07:08.516
- Dogati's doing.
- Dogati?

07:08.646 --> 07:11.315
For a hundred bucks
you can own one for life.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.652
- A hundred bucks? That's terrible.
- You can always bargain.

07:21.826 --> 07:28.161
Colonel, soon the girl will be ours. And
quatermain will be grovelling at my feet.

07:44.892 --> 07:47.928
Miss huston, meet the mapaki.

07:50.397 --> 07:52.686
(speaks mapaki language)

07:53.567 --> 07:57.150
We'll talk about it later, boss. Excuse me.

08:03.411 --> 08:07.574
Don't worry,
they were just grocery shopping.

08:07.707 --> 08:09.783
Cannibals.

08:09.917 --> 08:14.164
I hired you to take me to the house
of isis, not to take me on a tour.

08:14.297 --> 08:17.832
- It's just in the next courtyard.
- Thank you.

08:17.967 --> 08:21.336
You take, sir? Very very cheap.
Make good pet, sir.

08:21.471 --> 08:23.677
(all shouting)

08:47.873 --> 08:49.498
Miss huston?

08:52.086 --> 08:53.913
Miss huston?

08:54.839 --> 08:56.666
Jessie?

08:59.343 --> 09:01.466
Have you seen a girl? An american girl?

09:01.596 --> 09:03.719
- I have...
- I don't wanna buy...

09:03.848 --> 09:06.719
- buy for the lady.
- Get out of my way.

09:11.564 --> 09:14.269
I'll take that rug.

09:27.456 --> 09:30.373
Sorry. Wrong colour.

09:34.630 --> 09:36.539
Let me out this minute!

09:36.674 --> 09:41.668
What wondrous weavers we have
here in tongola. A talking rug.

09:52.398 --> 09:54.854
(yells angrily)

10:50.416 --> 10:52.658
Whoa. Whoa!

11:06.391 --> 11:08.051
Jessie...

11:08.185 --> 11:10.224
oh, no.

11:21.865 --> 11:23.905
(shouting)

11:42.345 --> 11:43.590
(door opens)

11:46.683 --> 11:49.352
How do you lock this thing?

11:49.477 --> 11:54.388
There. Now, how else may I help
such a lovely lady in distress?

11:54.524 --> 11:56.813
- Are you kassam?
- I am kassam.

11:56.943 --> 12:00.988
Great. You don't know
how glad I am to see you.

12:01.114 --> 12:05.361
- I'm looking for my father, jediah huston.
- He was to meet you here today?

12:05.494 --> 12:08.697
- No, not today.
- Perhaps you can browse while you wait.

12:08.830 --> 12:12.615
He wrote two months ago saying
he was coming to see you about a map.

12:12.751 --> 12:16.831
Many people come to see me
about many maps.

12:16.964 --> 12:21.460
Ah. This is a fascinating piece.
Egyptian, from the age of the pharaohs.

12:21.594 --> 12:26.968
Some other time. You must remember
him. He's a tall, thin man, grey hair.

12:27.099 --> 12:31.144
- It's a very special map.
- I have many very special maps.

12:31.270 --> 12:34.639
There. It suits you. And these too.

12:35.316 --> 12:39.777
Can't you people take "no" for an answer?
I don't wear bracelets.

12:39.904 --> 12:43.984
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you trying to pull here?

12:44.117 --> 12:47.652
Nothing. We were discussing your father
and a very special map.

12:50.749 --> 12:53.037
- Quatermain!
- My table!

12:53.168 --> 12:56.288
In town an hour and already
you're keeping bad company.

12:56.421 --> 12:59.956
Please. I was merely showing her
some egyptian slave bracelets.

13:00.092 --> 13:02.843
She's seen enough.
Get her out of that thing.

13:02.970 --> 13:06.136
If you like these, I'm sure
I can make you a very good price.

13:06.265 --> 13:09.883
Tell you what. I'll give them to you
at half cost. Half price.

13:10.019 --> 13:14.645
Where's my father,
you cheap-suited camel jockey?

13:15.608 --> 13:18.395
I am deeply offended.
I said before, I know nothing.

13:18.527 --> 13:21.481
Before, you didn't have
a gun pointed at your nose.

13:21.614 --> 13:24.781
Yes, it's coming back to me.

13:24.909 --> 13:28.029
Huston, you say? Huston...

13:29.122 --> 13:31.410
thin, tall man.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.249
Grey hair.

13:33.376 --> 13:37.041
Yes, he was here.
He examined the map and then left.

13:37.172 --> 13:40.623
- What map?
- Will you stop stalling?

13:40.759 --> 13:43.463
- I am too embarrassed to say.
- Give it a try.

13:43.595 --> 13:46.549
To king solomon's mines.

13:46.681 --> 13:48.923
- What?
- You see? Quatermain knows.

13:49.059 --> 13:51.976
There are hundreds of fake maps.
Hundreds of them.

13:52.104 --> 13:55.722
Unscrupulous merchants
palm them off on unsuspecting tourists.

13:55.857 --> 13:59.440
Any merchant will sell you a map.
All faked.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.108
Maps? Maps? Forget about the maps!

14:02.239 --> 14:07.115
Tell me where my father is.
Make him tell me where my father is!

14:07.244 --> 14:09.320
Please don't touch it. It's priceless.

14:09.455 --> 14:15.078
Priceless and not for sale?
That's just not you, kassam.

14:18.214 --> 14:21.049
Formaldehyde.
The egyptians used natron. This is new.

14:21.175 --> 14:25.718
- 4,000 years old and you call it new?
- More like four days. It's still wet.

14:25.847 --> 14:27.804
You don't think...?

14:57.254 --> 14:58.914
- Rupert!
- "Rupert"?

14:59.048 --> 15:02.998
- "Rupert"? I've been swindled.
- You killed my father's assistant!

15:03.135 --> 15:06.551
Where is her father,
you towel-headed creep?

15:06.681 --> 15:08.554
I do not know, I swear.

15:08.683 --> 15:11.387
Talk, kassam,
or I'll slice you into croc food.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.888
I bought an authentic mummy.
I've been swindled, believe me.

15:15.022 --> 15:18.142
If you don't start talkin',
I'm gonna start slicing.

15:18.276 --> 15:20.814
Please, please. No, no.

15:20.945 --> 15:22.143
No.

15:22.280 --> 15:27.191
I have a sick child. Practically blind.

15:41.758 --> 15:44.843
My statue! Oh, my god!

15:46.221 --> 15:49.306
Kassam, I'm gonna have to shoot you
before she kills me.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.758
That's bad luck for me.

15:51.894 --> 15:53.851
(mutters)

15:56.023 --> 15:59.641
These symbols... they're canaanite.

15:59.777 --> 16:01.402
Oh, my god.

16:01.529 --> 16:03.901
This is it, isn't it? This is the map.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.107
Yes, yes. But you've ruined it.

16:06.242 --> 16:08.994
- This is a map?
- Yes. You see?

16:09.120 --> 16:15.205
The belly is the plain of nalog, leading to
the twin mountains, the breasts of sheba.

16:15.335 --> 16:19.333
A dead rupert, the map -
this proves my father was here.

16:20.382 --> 16:23.798
- Kill me and you'll never find huston.
- Then he is alive?

16:23.927 --> 16:26.252
- Yes. Dogati and bockner have him.
- Bockner?

16:26.388 --> 16:31.975
It disgusts me. Greedy men trying to force
professor huston to translate the map.

16:32.102 --> 16:34.675
- Where is he?
- Your father is stubborn.

16:34.813 --> 16:40.318
That's what's kept him alive. And that's
why they want the girl, to use as leverage.

16:40.444 --> 16:43.065
I am personally repulsed
by such a concept.

16:43.197 --> 16:46.566
- Where is he?
- I do not know.

16:47.618 --> 16:48.946
Aagh.

16:53.791 --> 16:56.709
(gunshots)

16:56.836 --> 17:01.165
No more pushing me around! Get up!
You're trapped, both of you.

17:04.969 --> 17:07.638
- I'll take care of him.
- Jessie, no!

17:07.763 --> 17:10.053
I'll fix him.

17:12.644 --> 17:15.598
Thank you, miss huston.

17:19.317 --> 17:21.855
You took care of him all right.

17:23.029 --> 17:25.402
If we live through this, which is doubtful,

17:25.531 --> 17:29.031
remember - guns you shoot,
knives you throw.

17:32.414 --> 17:34.870
Watch this, kassam.

17:36.085 --> 17:40.960
You've got two choices - run like hell
or climb up and put it out so we can talk.

17:41.090 --> 17:44.007
- You've got 20 seconds.
- Allahu akbar!

17:44.510 --> 17:47.131
Come on. Let's get out of here.

18:04.572 --> 18:06.150
(speaks turkish)

18:11.162 --> 18:12.822
Come on.

18:12.956 --> 18:14.450
Coward.

18:14.583 --> 18:18.581
Seeing you dying is going to
give me such pleasure, quatermain.

18:18.712 --> 18:21.037
I've got it!

18:37.648 --> 18:43.687
- They've still got my father.
- Getting killed won't help him. Hide her.

18:43.821 --> 18:45.648
No!

18:48.659 --> 18:52.609
- Umbopo, please let me go.
- I'll protect you.

18:56.835 --> 19:03.371
This ends your stupidity in tongola.
A map destroyed, time wasted - a disaster.

19:03.508 --> 19:08.466
The map is here, in huston's head,
and we have him.

19:08.597 --> 19:14.433
Schweinehund! Your refusal to talk, your
impertinent stubbornness, is delaying us.

19:14.561 --> 19:17.598
Tomorrow we take the train
for the german camp in barumba,

19:17.731 --> 19:22.477
and there I will have only two words
to say to you: "talk or die."

19:22.987 --> 19:25.691
That's three words.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.574
You...

19:42.673 --> 19:46.967
if by the time we reach barumba you have
not revealed the way to the mines,

19:47.095 --> 19:51.721
I will peel off your skin,
inch by wretched inch.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.307
Was machen sie hier überhaupt?

19:55.437 --> 19:59.019
Sorry, pal. No sprechen sie the language.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.522
"Gun" I understand.

20:05.364 --> 20:07.736
Mind if I smoke?

20:20.379 --> 20:22.455
I've got it!

20:33.059 --> 20:35.550
Get in!
Dogati and the germans are on my tail.

20:35.686 --> 20:39.056
- Umbopo, come on. Come on.
- Come on.

20:39.190 --> 20:42.191
Come on. Come on, get in.

20:47.073 --> 20:50.027
- What's this?
- It's a dummy.

20:53.663 --> 20:56.071
They come in handy sometimes.

21:14.310 --> 21:16.349
I'll take it.

21:22.151 --> 21:24.025
Brace yourselves.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.659
Faster! Faster!

21:45.884 --> 21:48.457
- Watch out!
- Oh, my god!

21:56.728 --> 22:01.640
(muezzin chanting the call to prayer)

22:13.746 --> 22:16.319
Move these people! Drive over them!

22:16.457 --> 22:18.082
No.

22:18.209 --> 22:21.163
Get away. Give me this gun.

22:21.295 --> 22:24.462
- It's suicide.
- Scheiße!

22:24.590 --> 22:28.006
- We can't leave father here.
- I know where they're taking him.

22:41.441 --> 22:43.600
Morning.

22:50.826 --> 22:54.444
Hey, come on. Get up. Time to get up.

22:54.580 --> 22:56.656
God.

22:56.790 --> 23:00.159
- Morning already?
- Yeah. We got a train to catch.

23:04.548 --> 23:06.956
You know what I was dreaming about?

23:07.093 --> 23:09.335
What?

23:09.470 --> 23:10.929
Never mind.

23:11.055 --> 23:16.013
We have to get a few things straight.
Finding your father is not gonna be easy.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.220
That means...

23:18.354 --> 23:20.014
pretty.

23:20.148 --> 23:24.691
So that means you will do what I say
when I say and how I say.

23:24.819 --> 23:29.861
And if you got any other little secrets
lurking around, you better tell me now.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.661
- Crank it up, umbopo.
- You know everything.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.906
Besides, you should understand
why I was so secretive.

23:36.039 --> 23:40.286
After all, what did I know
about the great white african hunter?

23:40.419 --> 23:44.167
You could have stolen my map,
slit my throat and buried me.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.963
Hell, I could still do all that.
Umbopo, hop in.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.425
Umbopo.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.797
I guess he doesn't trust your driving.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.847
He doesn't trust anything
that moves without eating grass.

24:04.569 --> 24:08.234
Come on, umbopo. Get in.

24:08.364 --> 24:12.492
So when you're not terrorising
darkest africa, what do you do?

24:12.619 --> 24:17.446
I'm a student. Archaeology. You can
imagine studying archaeology in lowa.

24:17.582 --> 24:22.410
So when my father went to london
to teach, I tagged along.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.538
Quatermain...

24:24.673 --> 24:26.183
I'd like to thank you.

24:26.209 --> 24:29.338
You've... well, you've
been very kind to me.

24:29.364 --> 24:31.949
Kindness had nothing
to do with it.

24:31.975 --> 24:35.563
It's the thought of all
those ten-pound diamonds.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.560
You don't even believe in the mines.

24:38.687 --> 24:44.108
No, I think it's the thought of rescuing
a damsel in distress that appeals to you.

24:44.234 --> 24:47.568
Miss huston, you are not in distress,
you cause distress.

24:47.696 --> 24:48.672
(whistle)

24:48.697 --> 24:51.367
Ah, here it comes. The train to barumba.

24:52.076 --> 24:54.115
Umbopo!

25:04.172 --> 25:06.544
Here she comes.

25:10.970 --> 25:14.055
Do you think it's gonna stop?
I don't think it's gonna stop.

25:14.182 --> 25:17.516
- It'll stop.
- It's not gonna stop.

25:17.644 --> 25:19.518
(whistle blows)

25:25.902 --> 25:28.358
Nope. It's not stopping.

25:29.323 --> 25:31.362
It's gonna stop.

25:32.785 --> 25:35.572
It's not gonna stop.

25:35.704 --> 25:37.911
It's gotta stop.

25:38.999 --> 25:41.158
Damn. It's not stopping. Come on.

26:08.738 --> 26:12.902
I'm gonna look for your father. My hunch
is they've got him in the caboose.

26:13.034 --> 26:16.450
Don't even think about it.
Umbopo will take care of you.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.157
Oh, great.

26:39.353 --> 26:42.769
Halt! Wo gehst du hin? Komm zurück.

27:33.576 --> 27:35.948
(guard shouts in german)

28:48.903 --> 28:51.442
(soldiers wolf-whistle)

28:57.120 --> 28:59.908
Was machst du denn hier,
mein schätzchen?

29:00.999 --> 29:04.831
Ich besuche meinen liebling -
herr bockner.

29:08.590 --> 29:11.627
Surprise, dogati!

29:11.760 --> 29:14.002
Uh... hm...

29:14.138 --> 29:16.463
sehr gut, junge!

29:16.599 --> 29:19.220
Very good, guys. Yeah.

29:19.352 --> 29:21.558
Yeah.

29:21.687 --> 29:25.899
Great reflexes, boys.
I'm proud of you guys.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.148
Well, hey.

29:28.277 --> 29:29.985
May I?

29:30.113 --> 29:32.568
Let's have some fun!

29:32.699 --> 29:34.526
(plays camptown races)

29:34.659 --> 29:36.865
♪ doodah, doodah

29:39.039 --> 29:41.411
♪ oh, doodah day

29:49.299 --> 29:51.837
auf wiedersehen!

30:06.358 --> 30:11.020
I have had enough!
But obviously you have not had enough.

30:11.155 --> 30:14.820
Have you? Eh? Have you?

30:15.910 --> 30:17.784
Gib her!

30:19.372 --> 30:21.614
Will you talk?

30:21.749 --> 30:23.956
Will you? Will you?

30:24.085 --> 30:26.125
Will you?

30:27.463 --> 30:29.705
Look what you did.

30:30.341 --> 30:33.841
Unless you reveal the way to the mines,
I will pluck out your eye

30:33.970 --> 30:36.342
and crush it underfoot like a grape.

30:36.473 --> 30:41.467
I will do this with various parts
of your body until you are but a stub.

30:41.603 --> 30:44.141
And I will not give you
the luxury of dying.

30:44.272 --> 30:48.021
- Make him talk.
- (train clanks and squeaks)

30:57.912 --> 31:00.403
- Did you find him yet?
- Shh! Keep out of sight.

31:05.628 --> 31:07.502
- Daddy! No!
- Jessie!

31:07.630 --> 31:11.331
- Jessie!
- Put me down, you ape! Put me down!

31:11.467 --> 31:15.216
- No! Don't put me down!
- I don't believe this.

31:15.346 --> 31:18.133
For god's sake, get back up here!

31:18.266 --> 31:19.844
Quatermain!

31:19.976 --> 31:21.803
No!

31:51.050 --> 31:52.923
Shack?

31:53.928 --> 31:55.422
Bring me his head.

32:05.648 --> 32:11.235
What a wondrous surprise. Professor,
if you do not tell me the way to the mines

32:11.362 --> 32:17.198
I will pluck out your daughter's eyes
and crush them underfoot like a grape.

32:17.327 --> 32:22.368
I will do this with various parts of her
body... but you know all this, don't you?

32:28.255 --> 32:30.627
All right. All right. I'll tell.

32:30.757 --> 32:35.669
Don't tell him, daddy.
You don't have to tell him anything.

32:35.804 --> 32:37.963
All right. Tell him a little.

34:01.059 --> 34:07.560
As a reward for your cooperation, I will
ask sergeant dorfman to kill you. Quickly.

34:07.691 --> 34:10.525
Food, food, food.

34:10.652 --> 34:14.353
I find that torture
gives me such an appetite.

34:15.657 --> 34:17.068
(gunshot)

34:18.994 --> 34:21.235
Mensch, die kommen von beiden seiten!

35:00.870 --> 35:05.616
This is to punish you
for not talking for so long.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.827
Look what you've done again!

35:09.337 --> 35:13.916
You know, I find you most attractive.

35:14.051 --> 35:18.049
- You're a swine.
- I was not talking to you!

35:18.180 --> 35:22.047
I was talking to your father.
But I'm not fussy.

35:22.184 --> 35:24.889
I'd rather bring pleasure than pain.

35:30.901 --> 35:34.567
Come here. Come here.

35:37.867 --> 35:41.153
Come. Come here, little one.

35:48.044 --> 35:50.879
Come, strudel. Don't be shy.

35:51.005 --> 35:53.841
Adolf dorfman will be good to you.

35:53.967 --> 35:56.292
Very kind.

35:56.428 --> 36:00.722
I see in your eyes
you find me attractive too.

36:02.976 --> 36:04.768
Quatermain!

36:26.208 --> 36:28.450
- Umbopo! Glad you made it.
- Yes.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.875
Hold this.

36:37.553 --> 36:39.427
I've got it!

36:46.312 --> 36:50.441
Come on. We gotta get out of here,
they may come back for us.

36:50.567 --> 36:53.410
I feel so ashamed. I
told them everything.

36:53.437 --> 36:55.883
You've nothing to be ashamed of.

36:55.989 --> 36:58.445
There's a village near here.
We'll patch you up.

36:58.575 --> 37:02.407
- No, you must leave me here.
- No, daddy. We're not leaving you.

37:02.538 --> 37:04.826
The important thing
is stopping those men.

37:04.957 --> 37:08.824
Forget it. Let those primates get
themselves killed chasing a fantasy.

37:08.961 --> 37:11.666
It is not a fantasy, mr quatermain.

37:14.216 --> 37:18.463
My whole life has been spent
searching for king solomon's mines.

37:18.596 --> 37:23.887
If they fall into the hands of those men,
my whole life will have been wasted.

37:24.769 --> 37:30.273
Promise me you'll get to the mine first.
Promise me you'll stop them. Please.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.816
Even now, they may have
too great a head start.

37:34.362 --> 37:38.739
I'm gonna do it, quatermain,
whether you help me or not.

37:41.911 --> 37:45.696
- Umbopo, get the professor to the village.
- I'll join you later.

37:51.421 --> 37:56.380
I don't believe in the mines.
But I'm beginning to believe in you.

37:56.510 --> 37:58.170
(plane approaches)

37:58.303 --> 38:00.343
Come on.

38:02.391 --> 38:03.554
Wait.

38:06.312 --> 38:08.684
Be careful, professor.

38:09.899 --> 38:12.520
Looks like it's landing.

38:18.950 --> 38:22.615
It's landing.
There must be an airfield. Come on.

38:33.631 --> 38:37.250
- Haben sie das flugzeug überprüft?
- Jawohl. Die maschine ist in ordnung.

38:45.686 --> 38:48.058
- Ladies first.
- Thanks.

38:50.899 --> 38:52.559
Keep down.

38:52.693 --> 38:57.236
- Heute ist bestimmt wieder was los.
- Ja, ich hoffe, es rührt sich was.

38:59.241 --> 39:02.195
- Hi, boys.
- Was machst du denn hier, schätzchen?

39:02.328 --> 39:04.700
Ich warte auf dich.

39:08.459 --> 39:13.833
Great. Get in the plane, quick.
Get in the plane! Come on. Hurry.

39:13.965 --> 39:19.090
Great. Now I'm gonna spin the propellor
and you press this red button. Got it?

39:19.220 --> 39:22.091
I spin the propellor,
you press the red button.

39:23.850 --> 39:27.800
- The red one. Push the red one.
- I'm pushing.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.555
Push harder.

39:34.945 --> 39:36.487
Hey! Jessie!

39:36.613 --> 39:39.816
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't stop it!

39:49.418 --> 39:53.795
- I don't know how to do this.
- The throttle!

39:53.923 --> 39:57.374
Let go of the throttle!

39:59.053 --> 40:01.259
If I live I'm gonna kill her.

40:01.389 --> 40:04.343
He, die haben mein flugzeug geklaut!

40:04.475 --> 40:07.476
Die klauen das flugzeug!

40:07.603 --> 40:09.430
(alarm)

40:14.527 --> 40:18.655
- Stop it!
- Will you hurry up?!

40:38.427 --> 40:41.381
Hey! I'm on your side, remember?

40:50.398 --> 40:52.853
My father always wanted a boy.

40:54.902 --> 40:58.603
- He'd know how to drive this thing.
- Jessie!

41:00.450 --> 41:03.071
For pete's sake, slow down!

41:20.011 --> 41:24.424
It just took off.
Don't worry, I'll get the hang of it.

41:26.602 --> 41:30.434
- Are you nuts?
- It's like driving a car! Brrm!

41:31.440 --> 41:33.563
Are you absolutely nuts?

41:36.987 --> 41:40.652
Just look after yourself! Hang on!

41:43.994 --> 41:45.655
(jessie screams)

41:47.039 --> 41:48.082
Real bullets.

41:50.376 --> 41:52.998
Aaaargh!

42:03.640 --> 42:06.724
So, you are wanting to play chicken?

42:06.851 --> 42:10.303
I have never yielded. Never!

42:10.438 --> 42:12.312
Up!

42:13.692 --> 42:15.234
Up! Up!

42:17.779 --> 42:20.235
Ah, so, you are not a coward.

42:20.365 --> 42:22.821
(gasping)

42:23.368 --> 42:27.069
Pull back on the stick! Pull back on the...

42:27.206 --> 42:29.744
for god's sake, open your eyes!

42:29.875 --> 42:32.366
Very brave.

42:32.503 --> 42:38.588
But if you have eine kleine brain in your
head, you will be pulling away now!

42:39.093 --> 42:42.427
It's right there between your legs!
Pull on it!

42:45.808 --> 42:47.433
Nein...

42:48.603 --> 42:50.560
nein...

42:50.688 --> 42:52.895
nein!

42:54.859 --> 42:57.694
What was that?

42:57.821 --> 43:00.394
(groans)

43:06.288 --> 43:09.538
Where the devil
has that schweinehund gone?

43:41.741 --> 43:44.825
Mind if I get in now?

43:52.252 --> 43:54.624
Ok, I've got it.

44:03.180 --> 44:06.880
(ride of the valkyries by wagner
plays on gramophone)

44:17.069 --> 44:19.311
(sings along)

44:24.493 --> 44:28.361
We must cross rivers, climb mountains.
Must we listen to this too?

44:28.497 --> 44:32.163
I told you, this is wagner,
and I admire his music.

44:32.293 --> 44:35.294
Wagner is the greatest composer
that ever lived.

44:35.421 --> 44:38.091
- You mean he's dead?
- Of course.

44:38.216 --> 44:42.510
- Allah be praised.
- You are an uncultured barbarian.

44:42.637 --> 44:44.131
Hey.

44:44.264 --> 44:47.929
That must be dogati and the boys.
Let's go down and take a look.

44:48.059 --> 44:51.428
Maybe we can stir something up.

45:04.284 --> 45:07.202
Zurück! Lhr verdammten
schwarzen idioten!

45:07.329 --> 45:12.371
With their great understanding of german,
that should bring them back.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.039
Zurückkommen! Hierher zu mir!

45:15.171 --> 45:17.709
What are these?

45:18.966 --> 45:20.793
Drop 'em and you'll find out.

45:42.574 --> 45:43.819
Ah.

45:43.950 --> 45:47.699
They're coming back.
They're coming back. You see?

45:47.829 --> 45:52.456
With these primitive natives,
it's not the question of language.

45:52.584 --> 45:55.669
It's the aura of authority, of command.

45:55.796 --> 45:59.710
I commanded them
to come back here to me...

45:59.842 --> 46:03.008
and they are running away.

46:03.137 --> 46:06.340
That's all they can do,
these primitive cannibals!

46:06.474 --> 46:12.263
Running away and eating people.
Eating people and running away.

46:12.396 --> 46:17.771
Have you ever seen the german army
run away? Well, I ask you. Have you?

46:19.362 --> 46:20.642
(elephants trumpeting)

46:20.780 --> 46:23.532
I'll show you!

46:33.710 --> 46:36.711
There's a lot of smoke
coming out the back.

46:37.297 --> 46:38.672
Damn.

46:40.008 --> 46:44.220
And there's some brown goop
leaking out the side.

46:44.888 --> 46:46.928
Double damn.

46:50.477 --> 46:53.015
We're gonna have to put her down.

47:00.988 --> 47:06.658
We'll jump for it. When she hits, she might
blow. It's our best chance. Come on.

47:09.372 --> 47:12.408
Here we go. One, two, three, follow me.

47:15.503 --> 47:18.587
- You all right?
- I don't know yet.

47:20.175 --> 47:23.176
I never should have let you fly it.

47:23.303 --> 47:27.003
At least we're headed
in the right direction. Look.

47:27.140 --> 47:29.714
The twin mountain peaks.

47:30.685 --> 47:36.724
The breasts of sheba. If you'd crashed
between them, we'd be at the mines.

47:36.858 --> 47:40.441
Ok, ok. Next time we steal a plane,
I'll let you crash it.

47:40.571 --> 47:42.610
(explosion)

47:55.044 --> 47:57.202
- Trouble?
- Nah.

48:01.133 --> 48:03.173
(yells)

48:08.266 --> 48:10.424
That's trouble.

48:25.075 --> 48:28.740
- What are they saying?
- You don't want to know.

48:47.723 --> 48:52.350
- Isn't that the guy from...
- yeah. Nice to be among friends.

49:01.362 --> 49:04.648
A time for discretion, not valour.

49:05.617 --> 49:06.992
Stop!

49:09.204 --> 49:13.830
I think I'm gonna run out of bullets
before they run out of spears.

49:21.633 --> 49:24.338
Did you see his necklace?

49:24.469 --> 49:27.636
Yeah. A little pretentious for my taste.

49:27.764 --> 49:30.469
(yells in mapaki language)

49:36.148 --> 49:39.731
- They're friendly. How nice.
- Sure could have fooled me.

49:39.860 --> 49:43.110
And that necklace - 21st dynasty.

49:43.239 --> 49:45.860
- So?
- When solomon was king of israel.

49:56.336 --> 49:58.909
- So?
- So, don't you see?

49:59.047 --> 50:03.127
It's just more proof
that the mines aren't a legend.

50:03.259 --> 50:05.501
That's a comfort.

50:08.390 --> 50:10.098
What's wrong?

50:10.225 --> 50:13.511
Jessie, they're having us for dinner.

50:14.271 --> 50:17.889
Well, couldn't we just beg out?
I mean, without offending them?

50:18.025 --> 50:21.643
They're not inviting us to dinner.
They're having us for dinner.

50:21.778 --> 50:24.483
(gasps)

50:24.615 --> 50:26.572
Oh, goodness gracious.

50:28.869 --> 50:31.443
Well, do something! You're the adventurer!

50:31.580 --> 50:35.910
Sure. You take the thousand on the right.
I'll take the thousand on the left.

50:36.043 --> 50:37.870
(speaks mapaki language)

50:38.004 --> 50:40.459
Apparently they prefer white meat.

50:40.590 --> 50:42.167
- Ow!
- Agh!

50:42.300 --> 50:43.379
(shouts)

50:43.509 --> 50:46.214
- Oh, quatermain, I'm scared.
- You too, huh?

50:46.345 --> 50:47.970
Ow!

50:49.349 --> 50:51.637
Don't worry. I'm working on a plan.

50:51.768 --> 50:53.844
- You are?
- Yeah.

50:55.188 --> 50:59.565
(jessie) I can't believe this!
I don't wanna die!

50:59.693 --> 51:03.311
- I don't wanna die!
- Hey, jessie.

51:03.446 --> 51:05.569
Hey, look on the bright side, huh?

51:05.699 --> 51:07.822
At least we're the main course!

51:07.951 --> 51:11.071
Oh, sure! The brave joke!

51:11.204 --> 51:14.205
Well, I don't need to die with dignity!

51:14.333 --> 51:16.372
I wanna scream!

51:17.628 --> 51:20.000
(screams)

51:20.130 --> 51:22.918
(cannibals echo the scream)

51:30.057 --> 51:32.513
We're not dead yet, jessie.

51:32.643 --> 51:35.810
I hope they choke on us. (Spits)

51:44.614 --> 51:47.900
Not exactly my choice for a last meal.

51:48.034 --> 51:50.821
- How's that plan coming?
- Uh...

51:50.954 --> 51:53.623
still a few details to work out.

51:53.748 --> 51:55.788
Excuse me.

52:06.386 --> 52:08.593
Quatermain?

52:08.847 --> 52:09.890
Quatermain?

52:14.395 --> 52:16.352
Oh, it's... it's getting hot.

52:16.480 --> 52:19.980
It's gonna get hotter. Follow me.

52:20.109 --> 52:21.817
Did you find a door?

52:21.944 --> 52:24.020
Just do what I do.

52:24.155 --> 52:25.982
Come on.

52:38.628 --> 52:42.495
It's rocking. It's rocking.
Good. Come on. More.

52:57.064 --> 52:59.436
- When it goes... when it goes, hang on.
- Ok.

52:59.566 --> 53:01.725
- Hang on tight.
- Ok. Go.

53:16.959 --> 53:19.830
- One more time.
- Ok.

54:01.463 --> 54:04.832
Seem... seemed like
a good idea at the time.

54:52.891 --> 54:55.050
Are you hurt?

54:56.520 --> 54:58.513
- Are you hurt?
- Oh!

54:58.647 --> 55:01.565
Oh, god! Everything's moving.

55:01.692 --> 55:03.732
(moans)

55:05.696 --> 55:09.030
Just let me lie here for a week.

55:09.158 --> 55:11.566
Anything broke? Hm?

55:12.453 --> 55:15.123
Oh, everything's spinning.

55:16.708 --> 55:19.377
God, there's eight of you.

55:20.420 --> 55:23.337
Hey, come on. We gotta get out.

55:23.465 --> 55:24.507
Uh-oh.

55:26.343 --> 55:28.584
Go on! Shoo! Go away!

55:28.720 --> 55:31.211
Not a good idea.

55:31.348 --> 55:34.598
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Uh...

55:34.726 --> 55:38.345
wait him out.
He'll get bored and wander off.

56:12.432 --> 56:18.850
Did anyone ever tell you you look
ravishing with... onions in your hair?

56:18.980 --> 56:20.605
Thank you.

56:21.566 --> 56:26.691
- Think I should wear them all the time?
- Oh, yes. Delicious.

57:25.883 --> 57:28.634
Dogati! Come on.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.967
Quick.

57:44.819 --> 57:45.861
Come on.

57:52.285 --> 57:54.954
Gut gemacht. Mach so weiter.

57:57.624 --> 57:59.747
Quatermain's gun.

57:59.876 --> 58:03.292
Then he has been... eaten?

58:04.130 --> 58:06.586
Blind optimism.

58:06.716 --> 58:10.050
Till I see the body, he's not dead.

58:10.178 --> 58:14.805
- Bet you never had this much fun in lowa.
- Or exercise.

58:15.726 --> 58:17.469
Can we stop for a second?

58:17.603 --> 58:21.814
Not till we put more jungle between us
and dogati. Can you make another hour?

58:21.940 --> 58:24.147
Can you?

58:24.276 --> 58:27.147
Jessie, there's no time to... jessie?

58:28.113 --> 58:30.569
Jessie? What the...?

59:36.976 --> 59:40.096
- They washed my shirt.
- Yeah.

59:40.229 --> 59:41.937
Me too.

59:42.065 --> 59:47.023
You're not gonna...
put it on right away, are you? Kinda hot.

59:48.071 --> 59:49.898
Here.

59:55.954 --> 59:57.994
Thank you.

01:00:07.257 --> 01:00:09.297
Thank you.

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:18.176
Why are they bringing me all these
things? Why are they making such a fuss?

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:22.306
Maybe they've never seen
a white woman before.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.682
Maybe.

01:00:24.817 --> 01:00:27.688
Well, at least they're friendly.

01:00:28.654 --> 01:00:30.564
- Obugwa.
- What?

01:00:30.698 --> 01:00:33.320
Obugwa! They must be obugwa.

01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:38.078
Another tribe that legend says
guards the way to king solomon's mines.

01:00:38.206 --> 01:00:43.793
Unhappy with the world the way it is,
they live upside down hoping to change it.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.791
- Oh, that's sad.
- Mm.

01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:51.051
Must be hell to keep your change
in your pockets.

01:00:58.268 --> 01:01:01.055
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:04.896
Looks like...

01:01:05.025 --> 01:01:08.062
like floating stars.

01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:13.821
What are they bringing me now?

01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:17.783
Maybe it's some new kind of cocktail.

01:01:36.474 --> 01:01:39.012
What's goin' on?

01:01:39.144 --> 01:01:44.565
Maybe they think you're their queen
or priestess or something.

01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:49.437
Or maybe just the most beautiful woman
they've ever seen.

01:01:50.447 --> 01:01:51.562
Really?

01:02:14.889 --> 01:02:16.763
Let's get outta here.

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:26.975
Good shot.
Unfortunately he was on our side.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.227
Hey.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:41.573
Donnerwetter.
They are dropping like ripe plums.

01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:54.549
Thanks for the ride, fellas!

01:03:02.521 --> 01:03:06.222
Isn't that exactly like that other statue?

01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:12.528
How nice of the obugwa. They want
to show us the way to the mines.

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:37.554
Gagoola! Gagoola!

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:40.221
Gagoola!

01:03:40.477 --> 01:03:42.055
Gagoola!

01:03:42.312 --> 01:03:44.352
Gagoola!

01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:18.281
When they come for you,
I'll go for prune face.

01:05:18.412 --> 01:05:22.872
If I can get a hold of her, maybe I can
bargain our way outta here. What the...?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.954
Let go. Let go!

01:06:00.413 --> 01:06:02.904
No! No! No!

01:06:05.043 --> 01:06:07.534
No! Let him down!

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.532
Please let him down. Please.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.261
We didn't do anything to you.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.138
Please let him down.

01:07:28.254 --> 01:07:30.923
Oh, please don't kill him.

01:07:32.884 --> 01:07:35.125
Please.

01:07:35.261 --> 01:07:37.301
I love him.

01:08:01.413 --> 01:08:03.240
Holy mackerel!

01:08:20.015 --> 01:08:23.265
You're gonna be sorry
when he gets to you.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:08.055
I am twala,
the rightful ruler of the kukuwanas.

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:27.636
Jessie.

01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:39.319
Put me down! Let go of me!

01:10:41.954 --> 01:10:43.863
Quatermain!

01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:52.290
Idiot! Forget quatermain. Let's go
for the mines. Here is the highway.

01:10:52.423 --> 01:10:54.711
Alle hinter mir her! Los!

01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:59.338
When the mine is ours,
remind me to cut out this idiot's tongue.

01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:05.924
This is gagoola's
secret passage to the mines.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:09.347
- Why did they take jessie?
- Follow me.

01:11:10.817 --> 01:11:14.186
Come on! Follow me! Hurry!

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.360
Give me that.

01:11:25.457 --> 01:11:27.864
You idiot. You've led us into a trap.

01:11:28.001 --> 01:11:31.951
You saw the markings. You don't
understand the markings, do you?

01:11:32.089 --> 01:11:34.330
Turkish imbecile.

01:11:37.177 --> 01:11:39.847
The breasts of sheba.

01:11:44.309 --> 01:11:46.848
After you, colonel bockner.

01:11:47.897 --> 01:11:50.185
Turks are afraid of fire?

01:11:53.319 --> 01:11:55.062
Germans too.

01:11:55.196 --> 01:11:56.820
Back!

01:12:01.619 --> 01:12:05.154
I can't read the markings!
We'll follow quatermain.

01:12:34.278 --> 01:12:36.436
No! This way.

01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:38.611
Around here.

01:12:57.844 --> 01:12:59.219
Quatermain!

01:12:59.345 --> 01:13:02.263
I kill you with your own gun!

01:13:06.561 --> 01:13:07.604
No. Stay.

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.874
Looks like they're getting into trouble.

01:13:31.003 --> 01:13:34.087
The diamonds belong
to the german reich!

01:13:34.214 --> 01:13:36.966
We will not be denied!

01:13:37.092 --> 01:13:40.462
The german army will not stand for it.

01:13:40.596 --> 01:13:42.838
Help me. Help...

01:13:43.975 --> 01:13:45.766
let's go.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.265
Das ist ja scheußlich.

01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:51.516
Stop them. Kill them! Fire!

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.619
My gramophone. Fritz! Idiot!
My gramophone. Save my gramophone.

01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:07.246
I'm sinking! I'm sinking!

01:14:07.374 --> 01:14:09.699
Stop sinking. That's an order.

01:14:11.253 --> 01:14:14.004
I'm happy. No more wagner.

01:14:14.131 --> 01:14:16.622
Follow it. Follow it.

01:14:16.758 --> 01:14:21.467
We're all going to get killed!
We've got to get back!

01:14:26.101 --> 01:14:28.059
Now, herr colonel bockner.

01:14:28.187 --> 01:14:31.852
Follow me, herr colonel bockner.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:24.032
At last. The mines of solomon.

01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:28.574
And only one man stands between us
and limitless wealth.

01:15:32.086 --> 01:15:37.377
From now on, I am in command.
Make sure you don't forget it.

01:15:37.508 --> 01:15:39.382
Follow it.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:41.550
Go first.

01:16:31.689 --> 01:16:33.931
No. Wait.

01:16:34.067 --> 01:16:36.522
Gagoola will kill her.

01:17:00.969 --> 01:17:02.132
Now.

01:17:07.184 --> 01:17:10.849
Get her out of these things.
Come on, let's go.

01:17:15.443 --> 01:17:17.482
Follow me.

01:17:23.367 --> 01:17:26.037
Do not step on this stone.

01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:28.531
This one.

01:17:32.752 --> 01:17:34.496
Come on.

01:17:46.808 --> 01:17:49.679
The queens of the kukuwanas.

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:14.669
Sheba, first of the queens.
You are so like her.

01:18:15.421 --> 01:18:18.790
When I saw you, I knew I must return.

01:18:18.925 --> 01:18:24.963
When gagoola saw you, she knew to keep
her power, you must be sacrificed.

01:18:48.414 --> 01:18:50.240
Quatermain!

01:18:50.374 --> 01:18:53.825
You will never leave here
with the diamonds!

01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:57.544
The german army will not stand for it!

01:19:03.512 --> 01:19:08.934
Just in case, go there. If you find
nothing, come back here and wait. Go.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.768
Go.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:57.896
They got in. Run!

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:10.244
My god.

01:20:14.794 --> 01:20:19.373
You could buy lowa
with a handful of these.

01:20:24.679 --> 01:20:27.349
Quatermain! I'm coming!

01:20:31.603 --> 01:20:34.557
No time to be choosy.
Grab what you can and let's get out.

01:20:39.528 --> 01:20:41.568
Come on!

01:20:55.253 --> 01:20:56.877
Hamid!

01:20:57.922 --> 01:20:59.749
Coward.

01:21:03.136 --> 01:21:04.511
Quatermain!

01:21:04.762 --> 01:21:07.336
Quatermain!

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.638
Are you dead?

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:13.809
Are you kaputt?

01:21:16.608 --> 01:21:18.648
(clicking)

01:21:30.748 --> 01:21:34.366
- That's enough.
- Just one more.

01:21:44.512 --> 01:21:45.887
Can you move it?

01:21:46.013 --> 01:21:49.928
The whole kukuwana tribe
couldn't budge this thing.

01:21:59.944 --> 01:22:01.688
Oh, no.

01:22:01.821 --> 01:22:04.277
They gotta be kidding.

01:22:06.243 --> 01:22:08.698
I'll see if I can stop it.

01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:11.911
Get on the other chest!

01:22:23.135 --> 01:22:25.377
The lid. I'll get the lid.

01:22:31.143 --> 01:22:33.930
Help me with this thing, will ya?

01:22:37.483 --> 01:22:41.184
- Get it over to the chest.
- Watch your head.

01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.987
Prop it up on this corner.

01:22:46.117 --> 01:22:48.406
- Wait. Watch my hand.
- Careful.

01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:50.825
Careful.

01:22:50.955 --> 01:22:54.241
- Pray. Pray this works.
- Oh, god, I hope so.

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.747
Ah. That ought to...

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.585
give us a... minute to think.

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.343
Damn!

01:23:10.142 --> 01:23:12.597
Jessie, come over here.

01:23:13.479 --> 01:23:18.105
- I don't think I can get through.
- Yes, you can. Hurry.

01:23:32.123 --> 01:23:34.578
This one better hold.

01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:41.925
Oh, good. It worked.

01:23:44.511 --> 01:23:47.298
- What's that? Oh, my god!
- Quatermain!

01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:49.470
Oh, quatermain!

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:53.434
Water.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:57.144
- Looks like they thought of everything.
- It's getting deeper.

01:23:57.274 --> 01:24:00.275
Oh, quatermain, there's no way out.

01:24:02.279 --> 01:24:07.155
Jessie, don't panic. Don't panic.
It'll probably run out of water.

01:24:07.284 --> 01:24:10.285
I think I'll get out of this thing, anyway.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:14.540
There's plenty of air, and I'm right here,
so don't be scared.

01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:19.459
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
Do I look scared to you?

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:26.302
It's just a snake, sweetheart. It's only
a snake. Don't look at it. Don't look.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:30.427
It's only a snake. Keep 'em closed one
minute longer. One minute longer.

01:24:30.558 --> 01:24:32.800
Go! Go! Go on!

01:24:33.853 --> 01:24:37.305
- Is it gone yet?
- It's gone. It's gone.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.102
- All right, jessie. It's all right.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:24:42.237 --> 01:24:47.658
Oh, quatermain, if this is it,
I mean if this is the end,

01:24:47.784 --> 01:24:51.284
quatermain, I just want you to know that...

01:24:53.957 --> 01:24:56.164
I swallowed a bug.

01:24:56.293 --> 01:24:59.413
Hey, good. It'll keep your strength up.

01:24:59.546 --> 01:25:04.505
Quatermain, the only one who thinks
your stupid jokes are funny is you!

01:25:04.635 --> 01:25:09.712
Find the highest place.
At least we'll die young!

01:25:09.849 --> 01:25:11.722
Quatermain...

01:25:11.851 --> 01:25:14.686
I love you, quatermain!

01:26:01.443 --> 01:26:04.065
For me.

01:26:04.321 --> 01:26:06.895
For me.

01:26:07.033 --> 01:26:09.571
All this for me.

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:17.077
For me.

01:26:22.632 --> 01:26:24.708
And what for me?

01:26:27.137 --> 01:26:29.841
And what for me?

01:26:29.973 --> 01:26:32.096
You think you kill me?

01:26:33.727 --> 01:26:36.182
Old turkish invention.

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:41.899
Now you are the fool.
You are the imbecile!

01:26:42.903 --> 01:26:47.779
Never call a turk an imbecile
unless you make sure he's dead.

01:26:48.283 --> 01:26:52.068
With all this, germany will
win the war and rule the world.

01:26:52.204 --> 01:26:56.154
- You and I will be heroes!
- But I don't want to be a hero.

01:26:56.292 --> 01:26:58.368
Now,

01:26:58.878 --> 01:27:01.416
fill your hat.

01:27:08.721 --> 01:27:11.259
And your pockets.

01:27:16.104 --> 01:27:18.974
- And your mouth.
- What?

01:27:19.524 --> 01:27:23.023
You heard what I said. Eat the stones.

01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:26.237
You're mad. You're insane.

01:27:27.115 --> 01:27:29.155
What use are the stones inside me?

01:27:29.284 --> 01:27:33.946
Don't trouble yourself, my friend.
When I get you home, I will split you open.

01:27:35.165 --> 01:27:36.576
Now,

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:39.544
eat the stones.

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:55.852
Now swallow. Now swallow them!

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:03.644
Swallow!

01:28:06.322 --> 01:28:08.149
More!

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.661
Now swallow.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:25.047
Now more. More!

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.593
Now more, you fat pig!

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:41.395
(shouts)

01:28:50.034 --> 01:28:52.869
Move, you german pig!

01:29:03.006 --> 01:29:06.505
You made me swallow the stones,
but I forgive you.

01:29:06.634 --> 01:29:10.086
German laxatives are the best in the
world. They will work wonders.

01:29:10.221 --> 01:29:13.922
I shall think of you as
I sit down to, uh...

01:29:15.185 --> 01:29:17.806
count my blessings.

01:29:27.489 --> 01:29:30.989
But I will not shoot you.
I will bury you alive.

01:29:31.118 --> 01:29:36.742
Only this time
you better die properly, silly turk.

01:29:45.007 --> 01:29:47.795
Auf wiedersehen.

01:30:06.738 --> 01:30:08.612
Jessie.

01:30:49.324 --> 01:30:52.029
- We'll have to swim.
- Wait.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:00.160
Come.

01:31:11.096 --> 01:31:13.255
Stay where you are!

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:16.842
You have diamonds. Take them out.

01:31:16.977 --> 01:31:19.136
After all,

01:31:19.271 --> 01:31:26.021
diamonds are no good
to the dead, are they?

01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:35.828
Put them in here.

01:31:42.086 --> 01:31:44.791
All of them, I said.

01:31:54.182 --> 01:31:55.807
In here.

01:31:59.896 --> 01:32:02.566
Come get 'em yourself.

01:32:06.737 --> 01:32:09.192
Childish people.

01:32:15.579 --> 01:32:17.619
Step back.

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:36.299
The german army will not stand for it!

01:32:57.289 --> 01:33:00.409
No, don't! The diamonds
belong to the mountain.

01:33:25.693 --> 01:33:28.943
Go on, umbopo. Get her out of here!

01:33:43.587 --> 01:33:45.295
At last.

01:34:52.741 --> 01:34:56.870
Quatermain! We go together!

01:36:09.195 --> 01:36:15.234
Far be it from me to pry, but you might've
told me about yourself and the diamonds.

01:36:15.368 --> 01:36:18.073
Do not be sad
that you leave without the diamonds.

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:24.824
For you are the last to see the mountain's
secrets. That memory you'll have forever.

01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:27.001
Goodbye, umbopo.

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:44.732
- You know, I'm gonna miss umbopo.
- Yeah.

01:36:44.857 --> 01:36:48.985
- But he made me feel guilty at the end.
- Guilty? About what?

01:36:49.111 --> 01:36:55.316
Well, I thought you and your father
should come out of this with something.

01:36:56.536 --> 01:36:58.575
Well,

01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:02.832
I won't feel guilty if you won't.

01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:07.087
I didn't want you to go through
all of this for nothing.
