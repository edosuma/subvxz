02:32.902 --> 02:36.280
Did you knock 'em dead, Corky?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.906
I did everything right.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.538
You mean it went perfect?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.748
You're first time on your own.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.834
Me not there to see.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.963
Don't make it
more than it was.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.717
Now don't give me
that inferiority crap.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.761
Now, did the lift go okay?

02:59.888 --> 03:00.762
I never did it better.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.847
Open.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.599
Now, when you're
rich and famous,

03:03.725 --> 03:05.058
don't you forget me.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.268
I'll never forget you.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.353
Open...

03:12.692 --> 03:14.902
There are not
three guys alive

03:15.028 --> 03:17.988
that can do what you can
with those cards.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.240
I'm tellin' ya, kid,

03:20.366 --> 03:22.618
you're as good as the game.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.746
Sure, sure, sure.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.998
Another Houdini.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.751
Where you scared?

03:30.877 --> 03:33.712
I sure was when I started.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.298
Well, I wasn't calm.
But then,

03:36.424 --> 03:37.633
I wasn't all that worried.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.134
I figured I'd uh...

03:39.260 --> 03:41.053
done all the practicing
I could so what the hell.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.806
Were you the only magician?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.974
Yes, sir.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.476
The men all wanted
to be Bob Dylan

03:47.602 --> 03:49.811
and the girls did mostly
Barbara Walters imitations

03:49.938 --> 03:53.774
or sang Dolly Parton songs.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.985
Some of them panicked before
they got up to perform.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.780
Not you though?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.157
No, not me.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.992
See, the guy who was
in charge of everything

04:04.118 --> 04:06.203
ran things so well.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.956
He had one of those
hourglass egg timers

04:09.082 --> 04:10.874
and when he turned
it over you started,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.962
and when the sand
was finished so were you.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.004
Good evening.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.298
(audience talking and laughing)

04:26.099 --> 04:27.683
Tell me, kid,

04:27.809 --> 04:30.269
did you begin with
some flourishes?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.228
Yeah.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.562
You always taught me

04:32.689 --> 04:35.315
that they were the
best attention grabbers.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.651
Was I, was I right?

04:37.777 --> 04:38.944
It was amazing.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.280
Everybody quick
shut up and watched.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.990
No more whispering.

04:43.116 --> 04:43.907
Nothing.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.659
And once you had 'em Corky,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.995
then what did you do?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.664
Well, I quick told this
pudgy lady at the ringside

04:50.790 --> 04:52.207
to please pick
any card she wanted

04:52.333 --> 04:54.835
as long as it was the
big casino, the ten of diamonds.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.504
Okay, would you please
show the card to the audience?

05:01.175 --> 05:02.259
And I forced it
on her perfectly.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.928
Everybody loved it a lot
and laughed.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.055
And then I went
straight into rising aces.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.899
Did the lift work great?

05:18.026 --> 05:19.401
Yes, sir.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.863
The sand was really running
out of that hourglass.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.365
And I told myself
to forget it

05:25.491 --> 05:26.992
and just concentrate
on the moves.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.077
So, I took my time
and made it work

05:29.203 --> 05:31.496
and everybody applauded
like crazy.

05:32.582 --> 05:37.336
(audience talking and laughing)

05:47.430 --> 05:51.975
So I just took a couple of bows
and I got off.

05:59.233 --> 06:03.779
Oh, kid,
don't bullshit me.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.078
I really did
do everything right.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.455
Really.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.582
Only nobody much cared.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.002
And?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.590
And?

06:27.261 --> 06:28.428
Go on.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.138
I guess I just cracked.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.890
"You stupid sons of
bitches," I said,

06:32.016 --> 06:33.392
"Don't you know
how hard that was?"

06:33.518 --> 06:35.852
"That's a thousand hours
of my life you just saw."

06:35.978 --> 06:39.064
They don't care
from heart, kid.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.526
They just want
to be entertained.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.115
I guess I didn't do you
proud all in all.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.326
But did you
talk to the people?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.830
Did you use your charm?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.249
I can't, and you know that.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.759
Corky,

07:10.221 --> 07:14.474
you want to be
as good as the game?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.435
Don't you?

07:16.561 --> 07:19.396
You know I do.

07:19.522 --> 07:27.112
Then you better find yourself
some charm, kid.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.989
How?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.784
You'll think of something.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.380
(crowd clamoring)

07:58.311 --> 08:00.520
Hey man, why don't you--

08:05.735 --> 08:08.945
Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.864
Oh, yes sir.
He's right inside.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.032
Thank you.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.784
Say my man, how come
he jumps ahead of us?

08:18.664 --> 08:22.542
I guess this boy Withers
is your latest sensation, hmm?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.170
How are ya, sit down.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.131
Jesus, you booked him
into a very classy spot, Ben.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.424
And I found him here.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.219
You know, it's not easy
getting him to move.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.261
You want a beer?
It's safe.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.222
Sure.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.265
He likes this place?

08:37.390 --> 08:41.186
Well, he bombed here
his first time out, you know?

08:41.312 --> 08:44.022
But he didn't get--
Hey, get him a beer, garcon.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.273
Sure, Budweiser?

08:45.399 --> 08:46.483
But he didn't give up.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.235
He just worked his
ass off for a year.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.946
He come back
and he hit it big.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.366
There's never been
a magician like him.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.244
You dragged me down
here for a magician?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.579
Come on, Ben.
I run a goddamn network.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.082
We can't book those guys
on kiddy shows anymore.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.125
Now listen,

09:04.252 --> 09:06.545
your old man got his start
working for me

09:06.671 --> 09:07.546
you little fart.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.090
Don't tell me what bombs.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.051
Magic is misdirection.
That's all it is.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.262
And misdirection is
getting the people to look

09:15.388 --> 09:18.473
in the wrong place
at the right times.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.058
So?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.310
So naturally, magic has had
a little trouble on the tube.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.728
Why?

09:23.854 --> 09:29.442
Because you can't misdirect
the goddamn camera.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.694
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:30.820 --> 09:34.447
a warm welcome for
Mr. Corky Withers.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.158
(audience applauds)

09:45.751 --> 09:47.168
Good evening.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.211
Good evening.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.048
Ordinary deck of cards.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.175
Loaded with stage presence.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.177
I can't decide, does he
remind me more of Errol Flynn

09:56.304 --> 09:57.596
or Valentino?

09:59.640 --> 10:00.974
Thank you.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.268
Young lady, would you please
pick any card you want?

10:03.394 --> 10:07.022
As long as it's the big casino,
ten of diamonds?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.940
Will you show
the audience please?

10:10.484 --> 10:13.111
Dynamite opening, Ben.
Does he actually get better?

10:13.237 --> 10:14.738
That's hard to believe.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.657
Well he got a little nervous
on account he knows we're here.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.284
My teacher was a great man.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.162
His name was Merlin, and uh...

10:22.288 --> 10:24.664
No, seriously
his name was Merlin, Jr.,

10:24.790 --> 10:27.000
and this is his version
of the rising aces.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.335
And here were are,
here are the four aces.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.210
One,

10:29.337 --> 10:30.211
two,

10:30.338 --> 10:31.296
three,

10:31.422 --> 10:32.631
four.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.798
I'm going to place them
back on top of the deck.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.384
And would you
please pick any card?

10:36.510 --> 10:38.678
Just pick any card.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.888
Good.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.349
Look at the card, remember it,

10:42.475 --> 10:44.351
and cover the aces.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.269
Thank you.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.396
All right uh...

10:48.522 --> 10:52.192
I'm sorry, I did that wrong.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.152
You're not supposed to
cover the aces in this trick.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.570
Um, I'm sorry.

10:55.696 --> 10:56.780
One sec.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.366
He's gonna pull
a five card left.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.283
Watch him,

11:00.409 --> 11:02.118
just watch him, will ya?

11:02.244 --> 11:04.204
Goddamn drunks.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.664
He's not liftin'
just the top card.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.083
He's gonna grab five.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.334
Sir, if you think
you can do better,

11:09.460 --> 11:10.794
you're welcome to try.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.295
Just gimme a hand
getting up there, schmucko.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.713
And step aside.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.632
Okay, you're on.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.175
Okay.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.762
What's going on?

11:20.888 --> 11:21.930
Thank you.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.056
You really think
you're that good do you?

11:23.182 --> 11:26.309
I'll guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.436
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.230
Ohh! Thank you.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.066
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:33.192 --> 11:33.817
Thank you.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.193
Ahh...

11:35.319 --> 11:36.319
You ruined the rising aces.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.405
So what, screw it.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.532
You see the broad
with the big jugs?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.325
You mean the ah,
young lady in the feathers?

11:42.451 --> 11:44.244
Yeah, I see her so what?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.539
Wonder if she'd like a
roll in the shavings with me?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.624
I don't think
you're very funny.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.251
Well they do.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.461
Thank you.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.171
Thank you.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.134
A nice gimmick, the dummy.
What's his name?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.677
Fats.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.928
Don't encourage him.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.389
I will now change
a diamond into a heart.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.433
I guess the reason
I'm such a great lover is um--

12:06.559 --> 12:08.601
I don't want to hear about your
sex life if you don't mind.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.311
Tell us all about yours then.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.188
Everybody likes short stories.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.899
Shh, Don't encourage him.
Please, ladies and gentlemen.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.489
That's really a clever shtick.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.365
Thank you.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.284
All right,

12:24.410 --> 12:25.326
pick a diamond.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.369
Huh?

12:26.495 --> 12:27.495
I said pick a diamond.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.789
All right.

12:29.915 --> 12:34.127
It can change into a
heart while I'm holding it.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.379
Well, go on,
show the audience.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.465
If you're so great,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.175
change it
while I'm holding it.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.926
You won't give it back to me?

12:45.556 --> 12:48.224
Well, that's another
trick you've ruined.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.476
Let's see,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.019
I'll just have to
think of something else.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.189
You mean you're not gonna
change my diamond into a...

12:56.650 --> 12:58.151
Jesus Christ.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.486
What?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.739
It turned into a heart
while I was holding it.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.536
How'd he do that?
How'd he do that?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.246
How did he do it?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.498
How many times
do I have to tell you.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.792
Do you want to
get out of here alive?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.335
The kids good,
I'll give him that.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.753
Sure he's good.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.215
I got me maybe the best
magician in 50 years.

13:20.341 --> 13:24.177
Team'd with the first
x-rated dummy on the block.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.012
Eat your heart out.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.391
You say he really
bombed here first time?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.726
Yes.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.852
Of course he didn't have
the dummy with him then.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.521
The dummy helps.
No question.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.522
Right.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.272
Local talent?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.774
No.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.858
He was brought up near
Grossinger's in the Catskills.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.527
I think his old man
was a limey.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.404
Came here to work in a
health club and gave massages.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.781
Somethin' like that.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.698
(knock on the door)
It's me.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.450
Shit, It's old Gangrene.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.619
Gangrene.
(laughing)

13:49.745 --> 13:50.829
That's funny.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.163
Quick intro.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.874
Corky, our visitor from
New York, George Todson.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.459
How do you do, sir?

13:56.585 --> 13:57.836
You have a lot of potential.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.379
Hey, what about me?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.880
You're terrific too, Fats.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.257
Thanks, Mr. Wigston,

14:02.383 --> 14:03.341
I mean Tubeston.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.801
- Todson.
- Todson.

14:04.927 --> 14:05.718
(laughing)

14:05.845 --> 14:07.387
Now that's what I call funny.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.389
Hey, you'll strain
your pacemaker.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.473
Behave yourself.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.934
Come here a second, will ya?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.686
Ah, by the way,

14:14.812 --> 14:17.313
how did you change
the diamond to the heart?

14:17.439 --> 14:19.566
I'm the misdirection dummy.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.900
While we're bullshittin',

14:21.026 --> 14:22.569
you could bring an
elephant on to the stage.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.613
Which is why this magician
will not bomb on the tube.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.990
Why?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.950
Because the goddamn
camera watches their faces

14:29.076 --> 14:30.535
and not Corky's hands.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.370
So you live and you learn.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.371
- See ya.
- Bye.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.540
Yeah, all right.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.749
How'd it go?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.294
Sen-fuckin'-sational.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.545
See I'm catchin'.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.255
What happens next?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.466
Well, we reel 'em in slow.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.428
The same kind of
low key build up

14:48.554 --> 14:50.763
we gave
Steve Martin last year.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.682
I'm not lettin' you
near New York,

14:52.808 --> 14:54.809
till we're close
to making a deal.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.311
So I just stay here?

14:56.437 --> 14:57.937
No, first,
I'd like to book you

14:58.063 --> 15:01.316
in a small lounge
in Vegas for the experience.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.609
Then the area talk shows.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.361
You know,
Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.738
All leading to Carson.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.282
And if he asks
you to come back,

15:09.408 --> 15:10.783
I think he will,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.619
that should do it.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.622
So, you keep motor
mouth here in line,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.541
while I work on them
droolers at the network.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.294
It should take five,
maybe six months.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.964
Now, when I buy
you a free lunch

15:25.090 --> 15:27.884
at the
Four Seasons in New York,

15:28.010 --> 15:29.636
you'll know you're home free.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.471
Sound okay?

15:31.597 --> 15:32.555
Yes, sir.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.599
You're a good kid, Corky.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.736
Hey, you know what I think?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.947
No, what do you think?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.033
We're gonna be a star.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.631
(city noise)

16:33.158 --> 16:34.492
Zachary!

16:34.618 --> 16:36.536
Seems like I'm
breaking the law.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.037
I'll see that no one
touches it, sir.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.582
No one must ever touch a Rolls,
but a Rolls man.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.542
Yes, sir.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.798
Margo, will you
show this gentleman

16:48.924 --> 16:50.675
to Mr. Greene's table please?

17:06.775 --> 17:07.316
Hi.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.734
Hi.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.154
Is everything all right?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.865
They want me?
The uh, network people I mean.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.575
May I?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.992
Yeah, thank you.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.787
Have a cigar for later, Corky.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.667
Take two, they're are big.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.755
I invented
conspicuous consumption.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.591
Don't you forget that.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.470
If you're trying to
get my attention you got it.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.015
Will you do me a favor kid?

17:39.141 --> 17:41.976
Will you try not
to turn shit heel?

17:42.102 --> 17:45.897
It's almost an automatic
once a guy makes it big.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.192
I'd love to see
you beat the odds.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.693
Maybe I won't make it big.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.737
Come on, tell me.
What is it?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.614
Two years ago,
you couldn't get arrested.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.575
Two years from now
you are going to have it all.

17:57.701 --> 18:01.996
Corky,
NBC wants a pilot special.

18:02.122 --> 18:02.955
What's that?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.041
What's that,

18:05.167 --> 18:07.794
it's what they gave
Rich Little a while back.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.045
Menu, sir?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.630
Ah, you see, when
they're hot for somebody

18:10.756 --> 18:12.131
like they're hot for you,

18:12.257 --> 18:13.716
they make a contract which
hinges on the first show.

18:13.842 --> 18:14.967
And if it hits,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.345
you're off and running
for a bunch more.

18:19.723 --> 18:20.723
Terrific.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.141
That's why they call me
the Postman,

18:22.267 --> 18:26.145
I always deliver.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.563
Is it set and, everything?

18:27.689 --> 18:29.482
It's set but
it's not set, set.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.527
There's agent stuff like who
pays how much for publicity,

18:32.653 --> 18:33.861
how much for the guest stars.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.988
You'll have to
take a medical exam

18:36.115 --> 18:38.116
and stuff like that.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.079
Now what's wrong?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.748
Um...

18:45.874 --> 18:49.794
I don't think I'm going
to take the medical exam.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.089
Any particular reason?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.799
Principle.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.468
What the hell does
that mean, principle?

18:59.012 --> 19:00.179
Do you remember
that first night

19:00.305 --> 19:01.973
when you came backstage
at the uh, Stardust

19:02.099 --> 19:05.852
and you said, you wouldn't
mind representing me?

19:05.978 --> 19:06.769
Do you remember what I said?

19:06.895 --> 19:07.937
You're goddamn right.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.188
You said that
I could represent you

19:09.314 --> 19:11.816
but you didn't want to sign.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.693
That was principle too.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.820
Because if we're
happy with each other,

19:15.946 --> 19:17.113
our word should be enough.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.699
To hell with signing
some piece of paper.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.952
Why is this with the
medical exam principle?

19:23.078 --> 19:25.746
Because they're saying
something wrong with me.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.248
And I say I'm fine.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.000
I'm fine.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.209
I don't need any doctors

19:30.335 --> 19:32.795
poking around inside me,
that's all.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.422
Are you serious about this?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.801
I mean, is this a deal breaker?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.847
Yeah, I guess it is.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.811
Sadie, Sadie.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.146
I have to put you on hold.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.857
Sadie, what's the first
rule for being an agent?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.817
Never forget an
act that killed Lincoln.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.694
Head of the class.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.031
Get me Bernstein in Legal.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.075
Corky has turned impossible.
I don't believe it.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.369
Well, I should have
been a cesspool cleaner

20:05.495 --> 20:08.664
like my mama wanted.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.082
Corky's so cheap,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.250
last night he sent his
girlfriend out to hustle.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.878
It's not true, not true.
Just ignore him.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.171
When she came
back this morning,

20:15.297 --> 20:16.339
he asked how much she'd
gotten and she said

20:16.465 --> 20:18.174
"Sixteen dollars
and ten cents."

20:18.300 --> 20:20.051
Corky said "Ten cents?

20:20.177 --> 20:21.886
My God,
who gave you ten cents?"

20:22.012 --> 20:23.804
And she said "Everybody."

20:23.931 --> 20:25.890
Dammit.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.226
Everybody, she said,

20:28.352 --> 20:29.727
Body, body, body.

20:29.853 --> 20:30.978
Dody, dudy, duny.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.980
And she said--
And she said--

20:33.106 --> 20:34.774
And she said everybody.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.401
(phone ringing)

20:40.364 --> 20:41.447
Hello?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.324
I've been having
meetings for hours.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.743
I couldn't budge 'em, Cork.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.828
I thought you
said they wanted me?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.747
Well they do Cork, but--

20:49.873 --> 20:51.249
Didn't you explain
about the principle?

20:51.375 --> 20:54.126
Now kid,
this is network policy.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.254
It's legal policy.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.588
Now I'm sitting here

20:57.714 --> 20:59.799
with three of our
genius lawyers,

20:59.925 --> 21:01.759
my God, their IQ's alone

21:01.885 --> 21:03.970
must total up to 100.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.265
Now we have called
NBC a dozen times

21:07.391 --> 21:08.599
and they are not,

21:08.725 --> 21:10.893
I repeat not about to spend

21:11.019 --> 21:13.813
a half a million bucks only
to find out on taping day

21:13.939 --> 21:15.231
that there's some
kinda health problem.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.691
There's no problem!

21:16.817 --> 21:17.608
Corky!

21:17.734 --> 21:18.943
Make 'em understand.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.861
(hangs up phone)

21:23.031 --> 21:25.700
Well...

21:25.826 --> 21:28.077
Shoo, will you, fellas.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.954
Let me handle this alone.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.080
Yep, right.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.707
Good luck, Ben.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.299
(phone ringing)

21:41.425 --> 21:42.800
Yeah.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.969
Now kid, I don't have to ask you
what the trouble is.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.804
'Cause I know
what the trouble is.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.389
I've told you once before.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.933
It's just success, kid.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.143
Please believe me.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.895
You want success
but you're afraid of it.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.063
Now that happens to

21:56.189 --> 21:57.898
everybody at this stage.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.400
I'm not afraid.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.319
Now you stay right there.
and I'll be right over

22:01.445 --> 22:02.695
and we'll talk it through.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.904
I'm not afraid.

22:04.031 --> 22:04.989
Hang tight, kid.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.032
I'm on my way.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.575
I won't be here!

22:08.785 --> 22:11.579
(ominous music)

22:42.402 --> 22:45.154
We should hit Grossinger's
inside another 20 minutes.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.447
Never mind that.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.032
Take your next left.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.241
Here.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.919
Keep going into town.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.151
Your place?

23:24.277 --> 23:26.487
I was brought up here.

23:26.613 --> 23:30.366
Must remember it being
a whole lot bigger, huh?

23:30.492 --> 23:31.450
No.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.122
Want to look around?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.374
No point.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.126
Family all gone, huh?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.255
Yeah.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.006
Ah, you're lucky.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.177
I live with four brothers,

23:50.303 --> 23:52.430
all assholes.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.167
I don't want to come on
like some ghoul, but...

24:21.293 --> 24:23.002
Do you got people in there?

24:24.504 --> 24:25.796
People?

24:28.216 --> 24:30.092
Just family.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.487
You look a lot like yourself,
you know that?

24:49.613 --> 24:51.363
Yeah, I caught you on the
Carson Show a couple times.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.324
You must make
a ton for that, huh?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.950
How'd you luck into that?

24:55.076 --> 24:58.621
You know, see, I sing great.
I know they'd cream over me.

24:58.747 --> 25:01.123
My agent,
William Morris, arranged it.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.501
Is this Morris guy
a personal friend of Carson's?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.919
Is that how that works?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.171
William Morris is the name
of a agency, not a guy.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.172
Oh.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.632
Hold it, right here.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.175
Pull over to your left.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.054
Fine.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.722
Hey, this is Lake Melody,
ain't it?

25:22.395 --> 25:23.437
I'll be right back.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.580
(door bell)

25:47.337 --> 25:50.297
Anybody?

25:50.423 --> 25:52.049
Anybody home?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.136
What do you want?

25:56.263 --> 25:58.264
A cabin.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.976
We're kinda closed.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.228
Something above the lake
is what I'm after.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.355
It's just the kind of place
I'm looking for.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.190
I won't be disturbed here.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.400
That's for sure.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.194
But like I said,

26:12.320 --> 26:15.072
we're kinda closed.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.617
$50 bucks a night.
In advance.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.119
We just re-opened.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.788
If you don't want me waitin'?

26:22.914 --> 26:24.582
How you gonna
get to Grossinger's?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.375
I'll call a local cab
when I need one.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.376
How much?

26:27.502 --> 26:31.255
$80 bucks,
not countin' tip.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.923
Okay.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.508
Ah...

26:34.634 --> 26:37.261
Here's a hundred
for the driving,

26:37.387 --> 26:39.179
and another hundred,

26:39.306 --> 26:41.932
for a favor.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.559
Name it.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.854
You didn't bring me here,
okay?

26:49.566 --> 26:50.733
Okay.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.026
Good.

26:52.152 --> 26:52.735
Thanks.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.341
What you see
is what you get.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.384
The um,
the bedroom's back there

27:17.510 --> 27:19.428
and the kitchenette
and the bathroom across.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.347
Fine.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.806
Here's your key.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.159
Help!

27:42.827 --> 27:44.995
Help!

27:45.121 --> 27:47.414
Calling all schmucko's.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.832
Save me.

28:03.264 --> 28:03.931
Hi.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.308
Hi.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.821
Jesus Christ.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.073
This is Grossinger's?

28:26.204 --> 28:28.664
I wonder if her ass
is on ball bearings.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.165
Shut up.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.460
Oh, sounds like
I stepped on a corn.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.088
Sorry.

28:36.214 --> 28:40.259
No, it's just that I carried
her picture all these years.

28:40.385 --> 28:44.221
And she didn't remember me.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.848
Awe.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.744
He didn't remember me.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.756
Hello?

29:18.882 --> 29:21.425
Sorry to bother you.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.386
Oh, that's all right.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.392
No soap.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.561
I didn't think you'd like it.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.729
You leaving now?

29:33.855 --> 29:36.523
No, I didn't mean
no soap that way.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.734
I meant there wasn't any soap,

29:38.860 --> 29:40.611
or towels either.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.906
Oh, come on in here
and grab one.

29:45.492 --> 29:50.579
Oh, oh my God,
you brought Fats.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.582
You thought
Peg didn't remember.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.626
Awe.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.796
You knew who I was too?

29:58.922 --> 30:00.297
Yeah.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.389
Well, why didn't you two
at least grunt at each other?

30:09.516 --> 30:12.392
He's just as cute
as he is on the tube?

30:12.519 --> 30:13.393
Cute?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.436
Virile, yes.

30:14.562 --> 30:15.479
Sexy, yes.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.523
Ronald Reagan is cute.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.443
Oh please, could I hold him,
I'll be careful.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.820
Oh, he's heavy.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.488
Husky you bimbo.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.073
His lips didn't move.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.284
That's because you're not
stroking my levers sweetheart.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.494
Right in there.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.871
Oh, she goosed me.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.414
Ignore him, go right ahead.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.457
Okay.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.376
There.

30:38.461 --> 30:38.961
And there.

30:39.087 --> 30:39.837
I see.

30:39.963 --> 30:43.215
(moaning)

30:46.970 --> 30:48.470
I love it.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.933
Hey, she hugged me
to her bosom.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.893
I suspect she
found me irresistible.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.520
Don't we all?

30:56.646 --> 30:58.730
She asked you
over for dinner, huh?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.400
How long are
you going to stay?

31:01.526 --> 31:02.818
I don't know, why?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.444
If you stayed late,
that might mean

31:04.571 --> 31:06.446
you was getting
hugged to her bosom too

31:06.573 --> 31:08.532
which just might
make old Fats jealous

31:08.658 --> 31:10.450
and we wouldn't want that,

31:10.577 --> 31:12.494
would we now?

31:12.620 --> 31:13.912
Hmm?

31:17.000 --> 31:20.419
You never really told,
why you were here.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.629
Hiding.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.549
Gotta get my head on straight.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.010
My agent,

31:28.136 --> 31:29.803
he looks like
the Ancient Mariner

31:29.929 --> 31:32.306
in that poem we
hated in high school.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.557
He's negotiating
for a shot for me

31:33.683 --> 31:36.393
to maybe make it big.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.520
We argued.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.647
But I thought it
was just principle.

31:40.773 --> 31:44.526
The truth is probably
I'm scared of success.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.904
That's all.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.782
You always were this
weirdly timid person, Cork.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.242
That's for sure.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.497
Your folks still
run this place?

31:57.624 --> 32:00.042
No, they took
a motel in Florida.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.335
Gave this place to me.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.463
But I just couldn't
make a go of it.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.505
Too bad.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.510
The Catskills are dying
and that's the truth.

32:10.637 --> 32:14.014
Me and Duke
are lookin' to sell.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.559
God, you're beautiful.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.144
Don't I wish.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.692
I had such a crush on you.

32:25.818 --> 32:29.947
No one ever accused you
of having good taste, Cork.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.616
When I moved away
I whittled you a present,

32:32.742 --> 32:34.618
a wooden heart.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.036
You never gave
it to me though.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.372
I lost it
before I got it finished.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.628
I knew you had a crush on me.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.463
I was always pretty for you.

32:46.589 --> 32:47.798
I didn't say pretty.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.300
You didn't pick up on
my Duke mention either.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.802
After all, he is my consort.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.637
My spouse.

32:53.763 --> 32:58.976
I'm very big on
enlarging my vocabulary.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.686
Are you very big on Duke?

33:00.812 --> 33:03.105
We seem to separate
what seems like,

33:03.231 --> 33:05.607
every full moon,

33:05.733 --> 33:10.696
it hasn't been your everyday
Walt Disney type marriage.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.197
Where is he?

33:14.450 --> 33:15.701
Quick business trip.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.499
I'm sorry.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.584
Tell me, does he...

33:24.711 --> 33:27.629
does he still
look like James Dean?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.592
Hey.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.470
Hey.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.809
Hearty burgundy.

33:40.935 --> 33:44.730
Very medicinal.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.023
Peg?

33:46.733 --> 33:49.818
Admit it, now I'm beautiful.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.536
How was the orgy?

33:59.662 --> 34:01.246
Did you score?

34:03.916 --> 34:04.791
The high point of the evening

34:04.917 --> 34:06.835
was when
I reduced her to tears.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.550
That-a-boy, schmucko.

34:14.844 --> 34:18.554
Hey, when are we movin' on?

34:18.681 --> 34:20.639
Tomorrow.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.976
The day after.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.228
Soon.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.567
Peggy Ann Snow,
Peggy Ann Snow,

34:30.693 --> 34:35.112
please let me follow,
where ever you go.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.408
Why'd you close the door?

34:38.534 --> 34:41.578
I'm contemplating
taking a piss, do you mind?

34:41.704 --> 34:44.706
Ooh, fancy-yancy.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.793
Hey stick your head
out here one sec.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.592
Was you thinkin' about her?

35:15.363 --> 35:16.822
...Stuff like that.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.075
So how long did you
work with this Merlin guy?

35:20.201 --> 35:22.869
Ah, I worked for him...years.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.122
But uh,
he taught me everything.
But I never performed.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.957
Never like...never on my own.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.792
Why not?

35:28.918 --> 35:30.877
Probably afraid I'd fail.

35:31.003 --> 35:31.670
Dope.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.008
It wasn't 'til the week
he took really sick.

35:37.135 --> 35:41.805
And uh, he begged me
that I got the guts to try.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.058
Did you bring any
tricks up with you?

35:45.184 --> 35:45.976
No.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.227
I don't do tricks.

35:47.353 --> 35:50.272
Tricks means something
set up beforehand.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.690
A box with a fake lid.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.191
A stacked deck of cards.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.818
I don't do that.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.279
Will you just use
whatever's available?

35:57.405 --> 35:58.905
Yeah.

35:59.031 --> 35:59.948
Ah.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.074
Here.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.284
Amaze me.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.036
A stone?
Oh, come on, will ya.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.456
Well that was available.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.125
- Oh, do it again. Do it again.
- Do what again?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.044
Oh, come on.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.296
Okay.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.673
You bastard.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.842
You bastard.
I really love magic.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.802
No magic, it's just skill.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.679
All explainable.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.098
I don't think
I want to believe that.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.766
Can you explain everything?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.518
Pretty much.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.812
What can't you explain?

36:30.938 --> 36:33.273
Look,
I don't want to get into this.
Magic's just to entertain.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.525
You're not supposed
to take it seriously.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.611
What can't you explain?

36:39.822 --> 36:43.033
Merlin, his wife was
his assistant before me.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.952
They were close.
They really cared.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.495
Those last days
in the hospital with her

36:47.622 --> 36:50.874
he claimed he could
read her mind.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.877
You believe that don't you?

36:54.003 --> 36:55.253
I don't know.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.172
I want to, I guess.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.506
See in their act,

36:58.633 --> 37:00.926
they used to do a lot
of phony telepathy crap.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.427
Mostly cards.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.888
Then at the end they both
wanted to do it for real.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.973
To prove to each other
how much they cared,

37:07.099 --> 37:08.725
is how he put it.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.894
Do you know
the exact procedures they
did and everything?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.312
Sure.

37:12.438 --> 37:14.731
Look, I don't want to
get into this.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.774
Oh, it'll be fun.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.608
Come on.

37:16.734 --> 37:17.192
I'd fail.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.568
So what.

37:18.694 --> 37:21.947
I don't want you thinkin'
bad of me let's say.

37:22.073 --> 37:22.697
Okay.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.032
Forget the whole thing.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.158
I'm trying to get away
from pressure, please.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.868
So who's putting
you under pressure?

37:26.994 --> 37:27.953
Not me.

37:28.079 --> 37:28.995
Just thought
it might be a kick.

37:29.121 --> 37:30.956
But it's forgotten.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.255
Now we've each
shuffled a deck, okay?

37:38.381 --> 37:39.422
Now you take mine.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.010
So...

37:46.138 --> 37:47.806
just spread your cards
like this.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.018
Fine.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.311
Okay.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.106
Now take one card, any card.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.607
Look at it.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.111
And remember it.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.362
Now what?

38:02.488 --> 38:03.613
Now come on,
you must really look at it.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.991
I'm looking, I'm looking,
don't be mad.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.075
Okay.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.411
Just concentrate
on that one card.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.996
Now, gather your cards up.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.838
Place the card back face down.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.965
Good.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.925
Just cut the cards once.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.391
Just take my deck.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.934
Look for your card.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.269
When you find it,

38:34.395 --> 38:35.687
take it out.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.983
Tell me when you've found it.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.072
Okay.

38:46.198 --> 38:46.948
Okay?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.074
What happens now?

38:48.200 --> 38:50.368
What happened
with Merlin was uh,

38:50.494 --> 38:52.996
she put the card
next to her heart.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.041
And uh, he went through
her deck kind of like this.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.917
Ah...

39:05.885 --> 39:06.801
What's my card?

39:06.927 --> 39:07.677
I don't know.

39:07.803 --> 39:10.055
You must really think hard.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.139
Okay.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.392
Okay,
I'm thinking really hard.

39:14.518 --> 39:18.188
Well?

39:18.314 --> 39:19.606
I'm sorry.

39:19.732 --> 39:23.443
Well, don't stop.
I'm concentrating my ass off.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.819
Okay.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.204
My God it's red isn't it?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.039
It's red.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.832
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.042
I give away nothing.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.086
Come on concentrate,
just concentrate.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.392
Hey.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.601
Show me.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.904
We came close, what the hell.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.072
Sit down, Peg!

40:09.198 --> 40:10.156
Get back down!

40:10.282 --> 40:11.574
That was your fault.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.118
You started out fine,
but then you let me drift.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.869
Jesus Cork, forget it.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.247
I was in bad shape in New York,
Peg, and I had to run.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.165
Where do you go
when there's no place to go?

40:19.291 --> 40:21.000
You go home.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.086
Except there was nothing
but empty houses and
old cemeteries.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.921
And I figured
I'd stop by here

40:25.047 --> 40:26.339
and ask your folks about you.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.133
Where were you living,
what city, how many kids?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.426
Never expected
to find you here.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.302
I've loved you
all my goddamn life.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.097
I needed a piece of good news
about Peggy Ann Snow.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.933
Shuffle the goddamn cards,
fast!

40:37.059 --> 40:39.102
We're gonna do it right
this time.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.938
I just know we will,
because we both want it a lot.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.112
Give me your deck.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.283
Take my deck.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.244
Spread the cards.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.287
Take your card.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.204
Pick it out.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.414
Look at it.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.208
Put it back on top.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.005
Now, cut the deck once.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.011
Take my deck,
look for your card.

41:18.267 --> 41:22.270
When you find it, tell me.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.147
Look at me.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.400
Should I think now?

41:27.526 --> 41:28.860
Yes, very hard.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.195
I am.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.196
You're not, I can tell
by your eyes your not.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.864
Well, I'm frightened is why.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.073
Nothing to be afraid of.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.033
If it goes bad.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.451
It won't go bad,

41:36.577 --> 41:38.620
not if two people want
something as much as this.

41:38.746 --> 41:42.165
There must be nothing
in your mind but your card.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.375
Nothing in your mind but--

41:47.087 --> 41:49.130
What?

41:49.256 --> 41:50.924
My card.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.350
Concentrate.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.520
(clock ticking)

42:13.322 --> 42:15.198
Just think, think hard.

42:38.764 --> 42:41.140
Is it--

42:41.267 --> 42:42.767
Please is it--

42:46.146 --> 42:48.690
Is it the three of clubs?

42:52.403 --> 42:53.945
The three of clubs?

43:02.371 --> 43:03.871
I didn't fail.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.832
I didn't fail.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.376
I didn't fail.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.379
I didn't fail.

45:11.667 --> 45:14.585
I'll bet they don't give
service like that at
Grossinger's.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.634
Drop in again in 15 years.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.470
Why the jokes?

45:24.596 --> 45:28.141
I'm kind of feeling
my way along.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.309
I never fooled around before.

45:30.436 --> 45:33.521
True.

45:33.647 --> 45:36.315
I guess sex wasn't
that big a deal in my life.

45:39.987 --> 45:43.114
What about Duke?

45:43.240 --> 45:45.825
Mainly,
he blew in my ear a lot.

45:45.951 --> 45:47.452
True.

45:47.578 --> 45:52.290
I deceived him into
thinking it drives me mad.

45:52.416 --> 45:55.585
He tongues away at me
and I moan a lot but--

45:55.711 --> 45:58.421
secretly I'm making
a grocery lists.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.841
(laughing)

46:01.967 --> 46:04.594
Oh, I can be
a very crappy lady

46:04.720 --> 46:06.929
when I put my mind to it.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.974
Come here.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.603
Let's you and me take off.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.146
Just us.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.814
You don't care for Duke
and you know it.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.441
I dump Duke,

46:18.567 --> 46:20.276
and you'd leave Fats,
that's your offer?

46:20.402 --> 46:23.863
Yeah, just say the word
and we'll go.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.449
A man appears after 15 years.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.493
Says run away with me.

46:28.619 --> 46:32.121
A girl ought to at least
be able to take a bubble bath.

46:32.247 --> 46:34.040
Think about it, right?

46:36.627 --> 46:40.505
Why in the hell were you so
shy all those years ago, huh?

47:00.984 --> 47:02.485
Hey, what do you say
sports fans.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.694
Nah.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.447
What's the matter?
Getting your period?

47:06.573 --> 47:08.449
Feeling kinda blue.

47:08.575 --> 47:09.909
I miss the city bad.

47:10.035 --> 47:11.536
Oh, the country grows on you.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.162
So does fungus.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.751
I told you once
already we'd leave.

47:18.877 --> 47:19.669
When?

47:19.795 --> 47:23.506
When I want to, now drop it.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.508
What's so great here?
Tell me that.

47:25.634 --> 47:26.926
Simmer down, okay?

47:27.052 --> 47:28.219
Okay.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.516
Hey, how's this for a solution?

47:33.642 --> 47:35.685
You stay around here
and turn hayseed

47:35.811 --> 47:38.145
and I'll head
back to Manhattan.

47:40.983 --> 47:42.984
I take it the silence
means no?

47:43.110 --> 47:48.197
Discussion's over.
That's all.

47:48.323 --> 47:49.574
I want out of here!

47:49.700 --> 47:50.700
Simmer the hell down!

47:50.826 --> 47:52.493
- Just because--
- Watch it mister!

47:52.619 --> 47:53.995
- Just because some--
- You've been warned!

47:54.121 --> 47:56.372
Just because some
sagging bitch of an ingenue

47:56.498 --> 47:57.498
drops her pants for you!

47:57.624 --> 47:58.499
Shut up!

47:58.625 --> 47:59.750
Corky, you do it so good.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.627
You're even better
than the garbage men.

48:01.753 --> 48:02.837
(screams)

48:06.508 --> 48:08.551
Hey Ben,

48:08.677 --> 48:09.677
how do you like it?

48:09.803 --> 48:10.553
I think it's going
to be terrific.

48:10.679 --> 48:11.721
What's with Gangrene?

48:11.847 --> 48:13.389
Blue Cross
repossess your tongue?

48:13.515 --> 48:14.849
Come on in, shut up.

48:14.975 --> 48:15.975
Come on in Ben, I'll do the
whole routine for you?

48:16.101 --> 48:17.393
How the hell did
you ever find me.

48:17.519 --> 48:18.519
You're amazing.

48:18.645 --> 48:20.271
I'll bet it was
that kid cab driver.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.398
He must've called
the office and found ya.

48:22.524 --> 48:23.649
Is that right, that's it?

48:23.775 --> 48:25.568
Yeah, I told him
I was with William Morris.

48:25.694 --> 48:26.736
He looked like a hustler,

48:26.862 --> 48:27.862
so I gave him a
hundred to shut him up.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.989
How much did
you give him to talk.

48:30.115 --> 48:31.115
Doesn't matter.

48:31.241 --> 48:32.491
Right, right,
right, right, right.

48:32.618 --> 48:33.784
Right, you're here,
that's the main thing.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.620
That's it, right.

48:35.746 --> 48:36.871
Come on, grab yourself a seat.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.664
And uh, watch.

48:38.790 --> 48:40.708
Just remember that
I haven't got this anywhere

48:40.834 --> 48:42.585
near performance level yet.

48:42.711 --> 48:46.589
How long ya
been like this kid?

48:46.715 --> 48:47.965
Like what?

48:48.091 --> 48:49.592
Oh my God, you don't think
that was for real?

48:49.718 --> 48:51.677
How'd you think I rehearse?

48:51.803 --> 48:52.803
It's no good.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.598
It's for the act
for Christ sakes!

48:55.724 --> 48:56.974
Watch now.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.434
Ladies and Gentlemen,

48:58.560 --> 48:59.727
for your viewing pleasure.

48:59.853 --> 49:00.978
My version of
the Miser's Dream.

49:01.104 --> 49:02.146
Was it a wet dream?

49:02.272 --> 49:02.855
Shut up.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.023
Imagine if you will.

49:04.149 --> 49:05.149
When I have a wet dream
all that happens

49:05.275 --> 49:06.609
is I wake up
covered with sawdust.

49:06.735 --> 49:07.777
If you don't stop interrupting

49:07.903 --> 49:08.986
I'm going to put
a contract out on you

49:09.112 --> 49:10.446
with a mafia woodpecker.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.490
Oh, what I wouldn't
give for a woodpecker.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.742
Will you be quiet?

49:14.868 --> 49:16.077
Don't encourage him,
ladies and gentlemen.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.620
It's really a great beginning,
isn't it, Ben.

49:17.746 --> 49:20.748
Is this why you wouldn't
take the medical exam?

49:20.874 --> 49:22.917
You figured
somebody'd find out?

49:23.043 --> 49:24.210
Bullshit!

49:24.336 --> 49:27.546
I'll take the stupid exam!

49:27.673 --> 49:28.798
I was afraid of
success like you said.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.424
I needed to get
my head on straight.

49:30.550 --> 49:31.842
I'll take the exam,

49:31.969 --> 49:32.510
do the show,

49:32.636 --> 49:33.594
whatever you want.

49:33.720 --> 49:36.430
What I want kid?

49:36.556 --> 49:39.433
What I want is for
you to see somebody.

49:39.559 --> 49:40.810
Who? Who would I see?

49:40.936 --> 49:41.978
Quit with the games!

49:42.104 --> 49:42.979
Quit with the yelling!

49:43.105 --> 49:44.271
Shut up!

49:44.398 --> 49:45.398
He should show a little
grati-fuckin'-tude.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.524
You been slavin' away,

49:46.650 --> 49:47.733
comin' up with
the great new stuff.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.402
That was blockbuster
material, mister.

49:49.528 --> 49:51.070
When I come back with
Woody the Woodpecker,

49:51.196 --> 49:52.655
they'll plotz in Vegas.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.615
That's funny.

49:54.741 --> 49:56.325
Nothin's funny.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.077
Not anymore.

49:58.203 --> 50:00.621
What are you gonna do?

50:00.747 --> 50:02.748
I'm gonna make
a few phone calls.

50:02.874 --> 50:04.125
Tell people you mean?

50:04.251 --> 50:07.503
Corky, you ain't in control!

50:11.008 --> 50:12.842
Ben,

50:14.803 --> 50:17.179
you owe me a listen
don't you think?

50:26.940 --> 50:29.567
Yeah, I was kind of out
of control back in the city.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.986
I uh...

50:32.112 --> 50:36.490
I could feel myself starting
to slip down the iceberg.

50:36.616 --> 50:37.992
So you took off,

50:38.118 --> 50:39.618
and now you're fine?

50:39.745 --> 50:41.078
Sure.
On account of Peg.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.705
The local town pump,
terrific knockers.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.457
Look Fats, please.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.709
Come on, will ya?

50:46.835 --> 50:47.710
Sorry.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.795
Um...

50:49.921 --> 50:51.589
I've known her
ever since high school.

50:51.715 --> 50:54.884
I never figured I'd have
a chance with her, but uh,

50:55.010 --> 50:56.635
now everything's changed.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.512
She believes in me.

50:58.638 --> 50:59.638
Listen,

50:59.765 --> 51:03.934
girls are for
down the line, kid.

51:04.061 --> 51:07.688
Right now,
you gotta let me help you.

51:07.814 --> 51:09.106
I know a lot of people.

51:09.232 --> 51:10.649
Beautiful doctors.

51:10.776 --> 51:11.817
He means headshrinkers.

51:11.943 --> 51:13.235
He just thinks
you're a fruit cake.

51:13.361 --> 51:14.695
He doesn't, he never said that,
he's on our side.

51:14.821 --> 51:15.863
He's the villain.

51:15.989 --> 51:18.741
Don't forget that.
Never forget that.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.576
Hey, kid.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.081
I'm gonna ask you
to do something.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.791
It's a little something

51:26.917 --> 51:29.001
anybody ought to
be able to do.

51:29.127 --> 51:30.503
Now if you can do it, fine.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.506
We'll forget this whole thing.

51:33.632 --> 51:35.007
But if you can't,

51:35.133 --> 51:39.595
we'll think about getting
you to see somebody fast.

51:39.721 --> 51:42.765
Is it a deal?

51:42.891 --> 51:44.725
Name it.

51:44.851 --> 51:48.354
Make Fats shut up
for five minutes.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.786
Five minutes.

52:03.912 --> 52:06.789
I can make him shut up
for five years.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.290
Wonderful.

52:25.725 --> 52:28.894
I feel like the village idiot,

52:29.020 --> 52:30.604
if you want to know the truth.

52:38.947 --> 52:41.532
Can we talk or is it going to
be strictly semaphore?

53:07.893 --> 53:09.310
How long so far?

53:12.981 --> 53:17.818
There's 30 seconds.

53:17.944 --> 53:19.612
Gosh, that's uh...

53:19.738 --> 53:22.072
Four and a half minutes to go.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.991
Think I'll make it?

53:36.087 --> 53:38.380
Don't happen to have
another of those, do ya?

53:44.721 --> 53:46.305
Thanks.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.935
"Take two, they're big."

53:51.061 --> 53:53.020
Remember when
you said that, Ben?

53:53.146 --> 53:56.106
A pro never forgets
his good lines, kid.

54:00.779 --> 54:02.613
How long now?

54:05.867 --> 54:07.618
Coming up to a minute.

54:13.959 --> 54:18.921
Do you think we'll
laugh about this some day?

54:19.047 --> 54:20.881
We might.

54:21.007 --> 54:22.299
Make a terrific scene

54:22.425 --> 54:24.051
if you ever decide to write
your autobiography.

54:24.177 --> 54:27.304
Hey, I know what
you should call it, um...

54:27.430 --> 54:29.014
"Failing Upwards", or,

54:29.140 --> 54:33.143
"How to Succeed
in Show Business, by
Outliving Everybody".

54:38.775 --> 54:40.526
Two minutes yet?

54:46.032 --> 54:48.492
A minute forty-five.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.666
This is very cruel of you,
you know that?

54:58.003 --> 54:59.837
I don't mean it to be.

55:04.551 --> 55:08.012
I don't know if I'll ever
be able to forgive you.

55:08.138 --> 55:11.932
Well, that would be sad.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.976
Time?

55:14.102 --> 55:15.936
It's uh...

55:16.062 --> 55:18.856
two and a half minutes to go.

55:28.033 --> 55:30.617
I can't make it.

55:32.954 --> 55:36.540
Well, I didn't think you could.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.086
Hello everybody.

55:41.212 --> 55:42.504
This is Mrs. Norman Main.

55:42.630 --> 55:43.714
My mother thanks you,
my father thanks you,

55:43.840 --> 55:45.257
my sister thanks you,
and I thank you.

55:45.383 --> 55:46.842
You have nothing
to fear but fear itself.

55:46.968 --> 55:48.677
Nothing to give but
blood sweat and tears.

55:48.803 --> 55:50.012
Nothing to lose
but your change.

55:50.138 --> 55:51.055
Here he is boys.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.181
Here he is world.

55:52.307 --> 55:55.351
Here's Fats.

55:59.606 --> 56:00.731
You're not lettin'
him outta here.

56:00.857 --> 56:02.900
He's the villain,
don't forget that.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.235
Hey, I think you better
sit down.

56:05.362 --> 56:07.279
Hey kid,

56:07.405 --> 56:09.740
I have lived through
Tallulah Bankhead

56:09.866 --> 56:11.700
and the death of Vaudeville.

56:11.826 --> 56:13.035
I don't scare easy.

56:13.161 --> 56:14.703
But I need my chance.

56:14.829 --> 56:16.747
Your only chance
is to get help fast

56:16.873 --> 56:19.041
and that's what I'm
going to see happens.

56:21.878 --> 56:25.130
Don't, ever raise
a hand to me again.

56:25.256 --> 56:27.966
You're taking my one chance.

56:28.093 --> 56:30.469
I'm your one chance.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.141
He's right.

56:36.267 --> 56:37.059
The Postman's right.

56:37.185 --> 56:39.019
You're crazy.

56:43.983 --> 56:45.317
I tried to stop him didn't I?

56:45.443 --> 56:47.986
Tried, tried?

56:48.113 --> 56:51.031
You failed.

56:51.157 --> 56:53.909
God damn it.
Look at me.

56:54.035 --> 56:56.453
You know it's
the hatch for you.

56:56.579 --> 56:57.746
There's nothing wrong with me.

56:57.872 --> 56:59.206
I know that,
and you know that.

56:59.332 --> 57:01.750
But all those piss ant
dolts who run the world,

57:01.876 --> 57:03.877
they hate us
because we're special.

57:04.003 --> 57:06.046
They'll put you somewhere
dark and moody.

57:06.172 --> 57:07.756
Don't talk that way, please.

57:07.882 --> 57:09.049
Cut the migraine shit.

57:09.175 --> 57:10.384
Don't you care about anything?

57:10.510 --> 57:12.761
Christ, don't you care
about the girl?

57:15.181 --> 57:16.974
Peg?

57:17.100 --> 57:17.808
I love Peg.

57:17.934 --> 57:19.059
I hope she loves you too.

57:19.185 --> 57:20.811
So on visiting day
she can bring crayons

57:20.937 --> 57:22.146
and the two of you's
can color together.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.230
What do you want from me?

57:23.356 --> 57:24.857
You know goddamn well what.

57:24.983 --> 57:25.524
I don't!

57:25.650 --> 57:26.400
Liar.

57:26.526 --> 57:27.651
- Tell me!
- Weakling.

57:27.777 --> 57:29.278
- I'm not, I'm not!
- Stop the Postman!

57:29.404 --> 57:31.029
- I can't!
- Gutless fuck!

57:31.156 --> 57:32.573
- I can't!
- Stop the Postman!

57:32.699 --> 57:34.116
How, how with what?

57:34.242 --> 57:36.577
Me, me, me, me, me!

57:42.208 --> 57:43.083
(Fats screaming)

57:45.628 --> 57:46.253
(Fats screaming)

57:51.468 --> 57:52.301
(Fats screaming)

57:56.055 --> 57:57.014
(Fats screaming)

58:01.352 --> 58:03.145
(thud)

58:10.653 --> 58:11.987
Cork?

58:15.074 --> 58:16.867
What's up, what is it?

58:17.577 --> 58:20.537
Oh, I meant to ask.

58:20.663 --> 58:24.124
Do you want me unthaw
the asparagus tips,

58:24.250 --> 58:28.587
or the French-cut green beans?

58:28.713 --> 58:29.880
Either.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.298
No fair.

58:31.424 --> 58:37.304
You're the man you've
got to make the decision.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.972
Asparagus tips.

58:41.059 --> 58:43.393
Hey what are you
doing in the woods?

58:43.520 --> 58:45.938
Walkin', thinkin'.

58:46.064 --> 58:47.105
About me?

58:47.232 --> 58:50.067
You changin'
your mind about me?

58:50.193 --> 58:52.444
Jesus no.

58:52.570 --> 58:55.155
Better not you bastard.

59:03.039 --> 59:05.666
(groaning)

59:27.272 --> 59:28.188
Well, what is it?

59:28.314 --> 59:30.190
My head, you broke it.

59:30.316 --> 59:31.108
Well, what'll I do?

59:31.234 --> 59:33.193
Can't think, help me.

59:33.319 --> 59:34.111
I will don't worry.

59:34.237 --> 59:36.029
I'll take care.

59:36.155 --> 59:37.281
Ah.

59:37.407 --> 59:38.824
You're hurtin' me.

59:40.410 --> 59:41.159
Sorry.

59:44.455 --> 59:46.206
There you are,
that should do it.

59:46.332 --> 59:47.624
That better?

59:47.750 --> 59:48.709
I guess.

59:48.835 --> 59:49.918
Good.

59:55.508 --> 59:56.675
All right.

59:59.178 --> 01:00:01.555
Does it show?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.348
Well...

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:07.019
Well, I'll slip you into your
overall outfit with a cap.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:11.523
And uh, nobody will
be able to tell a thing.

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.984
- Hey, Fats?
- Yeah.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:19.239
- I've been doin'
some thinking.
- Yeah.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:21.575
What would you say if I uh...

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.328
if I called the police
and told?

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.038
You ain't being logical.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.831
Look, Gangrene
was taken care of

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.374
because he was going
to have you put away.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.419
If you tell the cops,
they'll have you put away.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.219
Well, what'll we do with him?

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.680
Bring me any identification
he's got on him.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:44.723
Why?

01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:46.266
Time for a little dip.

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:47.934
After dinner get yourself
some stones

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.063
and stuff 'em in his pockets.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.273
But I'm not that
strong a swimmer.

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:57.361
Just dog paddle out to the
middle and drop him down.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.945
I know this lake.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:00.238
There's snapping turtles out
there. Everybody said that.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.698
Once there was a
water moccasin scare.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.241
I don't care if the
Loch Ness monster's out there,

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.035
and he's ravenous.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:22.344
Do it beautifully.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.355
(screaming)

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:29.948
Hello?

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.622
Good morning.
Coffee's on.

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.213
Coffee's ready.

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:47.757
- Good.
- Careful.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:52.012
Uh, Duke got home
very late last night.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.513
He didn't much like the idea

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:55.682
of me being here alone
with a man.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.767
He's watching us now.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.608
Uh, do you think it's wise

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.736
for me to come up there now?

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.530
I think he wants to
watch us together.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:14.075
Oh.

01:05:15.786 --> 01:05:17.579
Give me five minutes.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:20.999
Hey.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.046
Has he got a telescope?

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.423
Because if he doesn't,

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:29.841
I'd like to say that

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.760
going to bed with you is maybe

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.596
the best three things
that ever happened to me.

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:36.681
And I'd love some coffee.

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:38.391
And I adore you.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:40.894
And I take it
with cream and sugar.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.355
And your breasts
belong in the Louvre,

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.814
which is a museum in Paris

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.983
that I plan on visiting with
you once you get wise

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.486
and decide to leave
the old ear blower.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.532
Are you ever somethin'.

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:11.049
Hello?

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:13.718
We're in the kitchen.

01:06:13.844 --> 01:06:14.761
Hi Duke.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:17.013
How are you?

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.598
Come on in, sit down.

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:21.393
Yeah, thanks.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.936
Doing okay.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.108
You take your coffee how?

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:29.651
Everything.

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:34.114
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to greet you.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.825
Help with the
entertaining and all.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.743
But somebody's
got to earn a living.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.872
You're still in
real estate, right?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:46.626
No, I gave that up.
It was dull.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.503
What I really like
is the out a doors.

01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:50.547
Go fishing, hunting.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.800
That probably seems dull
to someone like you.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.635
No, not at all.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:57.053
Fine, thanks.

01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:01.474
And I do a little
sellin' nowadays.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.226
Sundries, like that.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.648
I'm surprised Peg here
didn't bring you up to date.

01:07:08.774 --> 01:07:10.650
Well, she may have.

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:13.528
The truth is,
once I start drinking wine,

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:15.613
you can forget about me.

01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:26.458
Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.752
You don't happen to
have a penis do you?

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.670
My last one caught
Dutch Elm Disease

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.714
and it's murder
getting an erection.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.924
(laughing)

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.092
God damn, that's clever.

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.886
Don't tell schmucko.
Tell me.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.846
'Cause I'm the talent.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.890
Shh.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:45.393
(muffled scream)

01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:47.062
Do you travel
a lot in your work?

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.814
How do you do that?
I mean, that's terrific.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.984
I'm really glad you're here
for me to see this.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.613
Are you going to be good?

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:59.240
I mean it.
You promise?

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:04.079
Okay.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.623
Ask him if he's
glad I'm here too?

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.753
Yeah, the both of you.

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:12.879
Thank you.

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:17.716
How long are you going to be?

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:19.219
Quick as I can.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.763
As long as it takes me to
board up those far cabins.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:24.890
Don't stay out too long.
You'll get soaked.

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:27.852
How'd I do?

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:29.479
Just unbelievable.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:30.939
Too bad Fats wasn't here.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:32.689
He might of been a little help.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.734
Gotten a couple of laughs.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:39.322
You're always unbelievable.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.200
Oh, brains as well as boobs.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.831
Corky, do you drive a Rolls?

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.667
No.

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:36.754
Well there's somebody's
white Rolls parked down there.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.673
Shit.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.263
It's gotta be Gangrene's.
Why would he leave it though.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:46.221
Who's is it?

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.807
My agent.

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:49.475
He's rich as hell.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.935
But still you just don't leave
an $80,000 car and walk away.

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:53.854
He must have come
looking for me.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:54.814
Looking for you?

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.648
Yeah.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:56.983
He's left the keys.

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:03.823
Yeah, look if I level with you,

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:05.366
you won't let this get around?

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:08.995
I'm in hiding.

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:10.705
A lot of career problems.

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:13.917
I haven't been
behaving all that normal.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.335
Well, can you find out
what's happened to him?

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.294
This cars been here
a couple of hours.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.214
Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.842
Hey, would you mind
getting it unstuck?

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:24.928
Me driving an $80,000 car,

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.095
I'd mind that a lot.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.434
Sadie?

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.978
Sadie?

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:36.689
It's me.

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:38.399
Is he in?

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:41.945
Please.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.781
(dial tone)

01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:54.749
Don't yell at me Goddamn it.

01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:57.502
I'm sick of hearing
about my erratic behavior.

01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:01.339
How the hell
did you ever find me?

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:06.219
I tipped that bastard cabbie
so he wouldn't tell.

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:11.975
We were on a long walk
is why you didn't find anybody.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:18.982
Never mind who the we is,
finish about the car.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.692
Ha, ha.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.277
I'd love to have seen that.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:25.905
You hitchhiking
a ride to Grossinger's.

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:28.449
Why didn't you have 'em
come and un-stick the car.

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.536
Quit yelling.

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.914
I should a known,
nobody touches your Rolls
but a Rolls man.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.624
Sorry.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.209
Duke's on his way.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:44.173
Yes, sir.
That was the we.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.136
Yes sir, a lot.

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:51.764
It's not ridiculous.
We grew up together.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:52.974
Yes she's married.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.893
But I think she's
leaving him for me.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.021
The marriage was over.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:02.984
I'm not talking
about puppy love, Ben.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.320
I'm talking about salvation.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:11.284
Some fish.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.077
Some fish he takes me for.

01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:14.787
Your old pal
I'm talking about.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:16.205
I suspected.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.207
His story's so full a holes.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.126
Why do you keep
repeating that?

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.879
So a car is here, who care?

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.298
Besides, Corky agrees with you.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.675
It's a crazy story,
but there it is.

01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:30.261
Some happy coincidence.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:32.096
A guy drives 90 miles

01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:34.432
and you and Corky just happen
to be off in the woods

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.809
when he's snoopin'.

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.311
You put out for him
in the woods, did ya?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.104
I love it when you're drinking.

01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:45.485
Well,
why didn't you tell me about

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.987
this Goddamn
legendary walk before?

01:12:48.113 --> 01:12:49.030
No comment.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:49.947
Listen,

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:51.908
I know his story's bullshit

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.327
because I got the car out
of the mud and it was nothing.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:55.995
If I can do it, anybody can.

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.997
Maybe he tried.
Maybe he couldn't.

01:12:58.123 --> 01:12:59.999
He's old.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.959
Corky never said he was old.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:03.127
He must of to me.

01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:04.879
When?

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:07.048
When we were
having dinner, probably.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:11.010
He got squiffed fast
and flaked out.

01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:12.970
That's what he said earlier.

01:13:13.097 --> 01:13:16.307
And how did you know
he was old, did you see him?

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:17.725
Answer me, I'm talking to you!

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:19.060
No, I didn't see him.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.145
Why not?
He must've wrung the bell.

01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:22.772
I mean the guy drives 90 miles,

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.148
he's gonna ring the goddamn
doorbell, wouldn't you agree?

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:26.359
I didn't hear any bell.
Now quit this.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.403
Why not? What were you doin'
that was so--

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.533
Did he ring while you were
screwin', is that it?

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:34.492
That is it, isn't it?

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:35.660
No it isn't.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.869
Why didn't you
invite him in to watch?

01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:38.371
Shut your dirty mouth.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:39.747
Did you screw Corky?

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.124
No!

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.750
I'll pound you all day,
you keep lying!

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.085
I'm not lying!

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:45.336
The truth, the goddamn truth!

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.379
Did you fuck him?

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:48.798
No I didn't!

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:59.058
But I wanted to.

01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:03.938
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:07.066
If you don't like fishin'
I'll let you row.

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:10.027
Just had a good talk with Peg.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:13.239
Like to have one with you now.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:15.074
I'll grab a jacket.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:17.410
Where is Peg?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:21.205
She's in town
making a decision, she said.

01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:22.457
Oh.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.101
What are you doin' that for?

01:14:42.227 --> 01:14:44.103
Uh, habit.

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:45.438
Hey, we trust each other
don't we?

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:46.564
Of course.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.149
You seem upset.

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:50.193
Should I be?

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:54.989
Get in the front.

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:35.196
What are you lookin' for?

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.739
Nothin'.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:45.331
You're the one wants to fish.

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:47.917
Why don't you try over there.
Here I'll do the rowing.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:50.253
I know the best holes.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.255
When I get us there
you can take over.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.281
I'm not much on booze.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.283
I told you that.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.368
You told me a lot of things.

01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:24.287
What's that supposed to mean?

01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:07.204
Peg said you screwed her
last night.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.456
(laughing)

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.291
Damn.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.544
I told her to keep it a secret.

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.296
You think it's funny, do you?

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.089
Is that why you
brought me out here?

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:20.134
Try to get me to admit to
something that never happened?

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.388
If it is I'd like to
go back in now, Duke.

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:28.267
What she said was,

01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:34.106
she wanted to
go to bed with you.

01:17:34.232 --> 01:17:39.403
I'm loosin' her Corky,
and I don't know what to do.

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:41.489
All she does is
talk about you, Duke.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.575
You're not losing anybody.

01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:49.455
What I said before,
about quitting the real estate
business,

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:53.042
there was never any
real estate business to quit.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:56.379
She came in when I was on top.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.298
And she stuck with me
all the way down.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:01.300
Goddamn it.

01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:02.760
Oh, that's heavy.

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:08.891
Duke, I said I'd
like to go back in now.

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.479
This feels like a whale.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:15.231
God, I'm cold,
let's get the hell in.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:19.068
It's comin' loose.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:24.407
Hey, you're breakin' my pole.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.616
I'm trying to help you,
that's all.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:27.660
Well, don't help.

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:29.120
It's comin' now.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:46.512
It's comin'.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:05.573
Goddamn log.

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:12.705
Any of that scotch left?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:14.373
Thought you didn't like booze?

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:17.793
I'm freezing my nuts off,
that's all.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:18.919
Thanks.

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:24.425
Thanks.

01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:43.319
I wonder who he is.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.737
See what his wallet says.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.071
Jesus Christ,

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.406
I was thinking' he might
be your Rolls Royce guy.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:48.574
Gangrene?

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.367
You must be kidding' me.
He's about 6'3".

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.205
Nothin'.

01:19:58.877 --> 01:19:59.877
He's stripped clean.

01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:01.253
It doesn't make sense.

01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:03.380
Must be some identification.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.260
Jesus Christ,
he might still be alive.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:09.428
Fantastic.

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:10.763
I'll do the kiss of life.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:11.889
You run up to the house,
call Normandy Hospital.

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:12.848
Tell 'em to get over.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:13.557
Right.

01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:16.727
And stay at the house
'til they get there

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:18.479
so you can direct 'em
straight here.

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:19.480
Gotcha.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:45.167
(ominous music)

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:16.824
Ben Greene.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.118
Gangrene.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:22.496
Son-of-a-bitch.

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:24.665
He is the Rolls guy.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:52.609
Oh.

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:13.422
Jesus.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.382
Jesus.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.011
Don't panic.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:20.512
My God,
what have you done!

01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:21.597
I said don't panic.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.182
My God,
what am I going to do?

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.017
Well, pick me up dumb-dumb
and I'll tell ya.

01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:32.316
Listen to me.

01:24:34.527 --> 01:24:35.694
Listen to me.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.782
Well, sit down then, dummy.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.659
Alright.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.956
You're gonna zoom
to my suitcase and whip out
one of those

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.501
nice long pieces of canvas.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.672
Well clean my face
and you won't throw up.

01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:00.594
Okay.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.096
You're gonna take the canvas

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.556
and you're gonna wrap
part around Duke here,

01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:06.642
and part of it
around Gangrene.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.852
Then you're gonna
get a nice big rock

01:25:08.978 --> 01:25:11.105
and wrap the rest around it.

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:13.148
Take that out a my mouth.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.566
Then you're gonna row out

01:25:14.692 --> 01:25:16.568
and dump the bundle
over the side.

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:17.820
And if you do it right,

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:21.115
I'll be able to say
atta-boy, schmucko.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:23.242
Two birds with one stone.

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:05.868
Hi.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:06.910
Hi.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:09.496
You've had
quite a day I guess.

01:26:09.622 --> 01:26:11.123
Whatever.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.250
Where's Duke.

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:15.169
We had a blow up.

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:17.880
He tried to get me to admit
we'd gone to bed together.
But uh...

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.174
when he couldn't he told
me he was going to go hunting

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.343
and I should get the hell out
by the time he got back.

01:26:28.933 --> 01:26:30.517
Are you coming with me?

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.525
Are you coming with me?

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:42.821
I gotta know.

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:44.364
Who wins,

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:45.657
me or Duke?

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:54.166
If I'm a prize,

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.794
then you're the winner.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.338
And as soon as Duke gets back

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:01.840
and I can tell him
in person that I'm leaving,

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:03.342
we can take off.

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:11.016
Gee you know
I...I...I don't think you
should put yourself through

01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:14.937
a big emotional scene
like that, do you?

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:18.899
Well, I gotta leave Duke
with his pride.

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:22.194
We spent a lotta
years together and ah...

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.072
he's gotta understand
that he didn't fail.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:27.032
We failed together.

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:32.704
So let's the both of us pack,
okay.

01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:36.083
Don't try arguing
me out of this.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.251
He's got to be home soon.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:41.922
He can't hunt
at night time, right?

01:27:42.048 --> 01:27:43.340
Okay.

01:27:44.467 --> 01:27:47.719
Oh, my God.
She's leaving Duke for you.

01:27:47.845 --> 01:27:49.930
Fan-fucking-gradly,
fan-fucking-tastic.

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:52.224
Thank you sports fans.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.059
Well, where are we off to?

01:27:54.185 --> 01:27:55.269
Now don't get emotional
about this.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.938
About what, about what?

01:27:58.064 --> 01:28:00.691
I think maybe
there's just going to be two
of us on the honeymoon.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:01.858
What's the punch line?

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.277
You're gonna leave me behind?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:05.696
Come on buddy,
quit the kiddin'.

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:06.905
My head's on straight on now.

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:08.031
I want to get to know her,
that's all.

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:09.908
Take her places.
Show her things.

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.952
Paris, maybe, like that.

01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:13.704
The Eiffel Tower.
The Louvre.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:14.871
You know?

01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:16.081
Schmucko, you've never
been to Paris.

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:17.833
What's this "show her" routine?

01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:22.879
I'll be good.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:23.755
You'll see.

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:25.799
I wanna see Paris too.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.719
You want me to come crawling?

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:30.053
You want me to beg?

01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:32.389
Okay, this is me, Fats,

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:33.682
and I'm beggin'.

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:34.725
It's not easy for me either.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.893
It is.
It is easy.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.146
You won't be alone.

01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:46.320
I'll tell.

01:28:49.198 --> 01:28:51.325
What will you tell?

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:53.076
Everything.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.176
I will.

01:29:15.933 --> 01:29:18.018
I swear.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:20.979
In the middle of the act,

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:23.148
one night,
when you don't expect it.

01:29:23.274 --> 01:29:27.402
I'll scream,
there's bodies in Lake Melody.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:32.866
I don't see that happening.

01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:37.371
I'm doing a single now.

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.098
(stairs creaking)

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.516
Duke?

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:01.186
Duke?

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:49.169
How'd it go?

01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:50.212
Duke understand?

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.838
We haven't talked yet.

01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:55.300
You mean he isn't back yet?

01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:56.927
Christ, Peg.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.178
Got kinda scary up there.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:31:59.346
And I wanted a drink,

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:02.015
but I didn't much
wanna drink alone.

01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:08.104
Well, let's just go.
Let's get the hell out.

01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:09.397
Send him a telegram.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:12.275
I'm sorry, my mind's made up.

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.319
Besides, he can't be
much longer.

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:16.112
You don't know that.

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:19.115
He was drinking heavy
when he left here.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:21.910
Did he take a flashlight
with him? Did you notice?

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:23.328
All I noticed

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:24.621
was that big goddamn
elephant gun he was carrying

01:32:24.747 --> 01:32:28.124
when he hinted
I vacate the premises.

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:29.251
Come on,

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.627
it's stupid waiting around.

01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:33.129
Then I'm stupid.

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.090
I didn't say you were stupid.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.633
I said waiting was.

01:32:36.759 --> 01:32:38.677
I'm aware of your opinion
on the subject.

01:32:38.803 --> 01:32:40.470
Well, try agreeing with me
for once.

01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:42.305
Instead of being stubborn.

01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:44.307
Give it a rest, Cork.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:50.272
(singing)
Ah...

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:55.318
Sweet mystery of life
at last I've found you.

01:32:55.444 --> 01:32:57.195
Fasten your
seat belts everybody.

01:32:57.321 --> 01:33:00.615
It's going to be a
bumpy night.

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:03.159
I'm here to save you two
from yourselves.

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:06.997
Want me to do
something dazzling?

01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:09.165
You do magic too?

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.458
Corky does magic.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.085
I only do tricks.

01:33:13.462 --> 01:33:15.672
Hey, I got just the thing, Peg.

01:33:15.798 --> 01:33:17.090
Bring me a couple
a decks of cards

01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:18.842
and I'll read your mind.

01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:21.469
What do you mean?

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:22.637
I'll pull the same
card from your deck

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:25.307
that you pulled from mine.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.350
That's not a trick.
You can't do that.

01:33:27.476 --> 01:33:28.768
Sure.

01:33:28.894 --> 01:33:29.978
You just peek at the bottom
card after shuffling

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:31.771
and it's easy as apple pie.

01:33:31.897 --> 01:33:34.357
Corky makes a big deal
production number out of it
sometimes.

01:33:34.483 --> 01:33:38.278
Like when he's got some bimbo
stewardess he wants to screw.

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:39.904
He makes him think
their minds have touched.

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:41.448
Never fails.

01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.033
You'll never know
how many people

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:45.327
want to believe in magic.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.251
Oh shit.

01:33:57.381 --> 01:33:58.214
Peg.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.342
Peg, please.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.761
- Please, please come--
- Leave me alone.

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:04.304
Were you laughing
every second.

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:05.472
Please, please.

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:10.393
Was I funny you
bastard son-of-a-bitch?

01:34:10.519 --> 01:34:11.144
Oh!

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:12.270
Let me explain.

01:34:12.396 --> 01:34:15.231
Hey, hey.

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:16.650
Jesus.

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:21.321
Listen to me you schmuck.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:25.408
You gotta please just
answer me one small question?

01:34:25.534 --> 01:34:27.285
Why'd you think
I blew the whistle?

01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:30.246
Ah, because I was leaving.
Because you were jealous.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:33.625
Wrong, schmucko.
I did it because I could.

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:35.210
See?

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:37.212
Why didn't you stop me?

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:40.632
Answer, you didn't
because you couldn't.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:44.511
Look at him.
He still doesn't understand.

01:34:44.637 --> 01:34:45.637
Better sit down kid

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:48.723
while I hit you
with an explanation.

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:53.728
Ever since we got together,
I laid low.

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.105
It was best for the act.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.564
I let you share the limelight.

01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:58.775
If there's one
thing about me, I'm big.

01:34:58.901 --> 01:35:00.777
But then earlier today,
when I begged ya,

01:35:00.903 --> 01:35:02.112
pleaded not to be left behind

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:04.155
and you pissed ice water
all over me,

01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:08.034
well, that tore it.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.453
If I'm boring you,
please walk around.

01:35:10.579 --> 01:35:12.330
I don't care.

01:35:12.456 --> 01:35:16.292
Fats, don't start in on me.
Please don't.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:17.711
Listen, I took a failure.

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:19.421
With the charm of
Tricky Dickey Nixon.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:21.047
I made us skyrocket.

01:35:21.173 --> 01:35:23.299
It's not gonna be you and her,
it's gonna stay you and me.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:25.343
Except from now on
even that's changed.

01:35:25.469 --> 01:35:26.469
It's me and you.

01:35:26.595 --> 01:35:28.096
You said I've got
a weak stomach.

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.681
- You look tired.
- I'm not.

01:35:29.807 --> 01:35:31.433
- Then what are you
yawning for?
- I'm not yawning.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.934
You gotta wake you up.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.686
- Crawl around.
That should help.
- You think?

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:36.479
Hey yeah, it does help.

01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:38.356
Say thank you, Fats.

01:35:38.482 --> 01:35:39.357
Thanks.

01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:40.608
Thanks, Fats.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.485
With feeling, like I'm doing.

01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:44.404
I'm filled with
grati-fucking-tude.

01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:45.488
Gee, you've got talent
after all.

01:35:45.614 --> 01:35:46.322
Let's see what else
you can do.

01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.324
Fats says smile.

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:49.617
Fats says frown.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.494
Fats says touch the ceiling.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.329
Fats says spin around.

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:55.039
Fats says get a knife.

01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:57.667
What?

01:35:57.793 --> 01:36:00.086
Get a knife.

01:36:00.212 --> 01:36:01.337
Come on.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:03.673
From my suitcase.

01:36:03.799 --> 01:36:05.341
Yeah.

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:06.593
I know where it is.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:08.094
I wonder what we
could do with it?

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.345
Hey, I could whittle something.

01:36:09.472 --> 01:36:11.139
I'm good at that,
and fast too, name it.

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:14.309
No. I'm looking for something
with a little more pizzazz.

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:17.937
Don't do it.

01:36:18.063 --> 01:36:21.441
You really love
old Peg, don't ya?

01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:23.109
Oh please, don't kill her.

01:36:23.235 --> 01:36:24.778
Schmucko, easy.

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.863
I wouldn't dream of depriving
you of that pleasure.

01:36:26.989 --> 01:36:28.114
No, I can't do it!

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.116
There's that old
bug-a-boo of yours again.

01:36:30.242 --> 01:36:31.117
lack of confidence.

01:36:31.243 --> 01:36:33.203
I won't and you can't make me!

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:35.371
Wow, I really stepped
on a corn that time.

01:36:35.498 --> 01:36:36.372
If I can't make ya,
I can't make ya.

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:38.291
- How's your head, Cork?
- Fine!

01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:39.834
Thought you might
be getting' a migraine.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.710
No!

01:36:40.836 --> 01:36:42.212
Shows how wrong you can be.

01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:45.256
(screaming)

01:36:47.676 --> 01:36:49.385
Open those baby blues.

01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:52.347
Looks to me like one
of those gut wrenchers.

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:55.558
It's getting bad fast.

01:36:55.684 --> 01:36:56.768
Please!

01:36:56.894 --> 01:37:00.480
Drilling right into the brain,
is it?

01:37:00.606 --> 01:37:02.565
(moaning in pain)

01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:05.652
Surprise.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:06.528
Came fast.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.655
It can go fast.
Yeah?

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:09.489
Oh yes.

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:11.366
Not so deep anymore?

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.909
No, not so deep.

01:37:13.035 --> 01:37:14.577
It'll all be gone soon.

01:37:14.703 --> 01:37:18.289
Uh...thanks, Fats.

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.172
Want it a hundred times worse,
and a hundred days long?

01:37:26.298 --> 01:37:28.466
No.

01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:33.096
Then take the knife
on up the hill, lover.

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:39.269
And kiss the girl goodbye.

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:58.454
(door rattling)

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:00.582
Duke?

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:05.837
I left schmucko
down at the cabin.

01:38:05.963 --> 01:38:07.714
Open up, huh?

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.758
You and me gotta
have a quick palaver.

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:12.802
Corky, there's nothin' to say.

01:38:12.928 --> 01:38:15.263
I told ya,
he's at the cabin.

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:19.601
You and me are the only ones
who can straighten this out.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.436
Go away, Cork.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.478
Fats.

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:24.606
All right, go away, Fats.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:25.982
That's better.

01:38:26.108 --> 01:38:29.569
At least we know
who we are now.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:32.530
Hey, I've got a present
that'll make you smile.

01:38:32.656 --> 01:38:34.073
Promise it will.

01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:36.784
He made it for you, Peg.
For you to remember him by.

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:40.496
See, he's leaving now and he
wants you to have this.

01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:42.582
Have what?

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:44.792
A wooden heart.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:47.712
He whittled it for you
before he sent me up.

01:38:47.838 --> 01:38:51.257
He's quick with his hands.

01:38:51.383 --> 01:38:54.636
Leave it outside the door.

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.512
Take his heart, Peg.

01:38:56.639 --> 01:39:01.267
So he'll know you don't
feel contempt for him.

01:39:01.393 --> 01:39:04.437
Oh, I never felt that.

01:39:04.563 --> 01:39:06.689
At least that's something.

01:39:06.815 --> 01:39:10.818
I'll leave it by the door.

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:12.362
Bye.

01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:29.462
Wait a minute,
you didn't leave.

01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:32.465
Brains as well as boobs.

01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:35.426
Anytime you feel like playing
with my levers you'll call?

01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:38.888
Sure, sure.

01:39:39.014 --> 01:39:40.390
Peggy Ann Snow,

01:39:41.183 --> 01:39:42.392
Peggy Ann Snow,

01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:44.352
please let me follow

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:46.312
wherever you go...

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:53.444
(ominous music)

01:41:13.942 --> 01:41:17.653
She liked my heart.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.990
She smiled when
she picked it up.

01:41:21.116 --> 01:41:24.660
She looked so
pleased and everything.

01:41:24.787 --> 01:41:26.579
I made her happy.

01:41:26.705 --> 01:41:27.747
Me.

01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.916
No tricks or anything.

01:41:31.794 --> 01:41:33.753
What's wrong?

01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:36.714
I don't know how to say this,
since I haven't got a stomach,

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.468
but my stomach hurts.

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:41.761
Bad?

01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:43.763
Gettin' bad.

01:41:43.889 --> 01:41:45.807
Gettin' real bad.

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:47.475
Yeah.

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:52.063
What's goin' on?

01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:54.899
We're dying I think
is what it is?

01:41:55.025 --> 01:41:56.943
Dyin'?

01:41:57.069 --> 01:41:58.611
Yeah,

01:41:58.737 --> 01:42:01.864
I put the knife deep in me.

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:05.701
Christ, it's spreadin'.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.870
Yeah.

01:42:07.996 --> 01:42:12.875
Don't leave me here alone.

01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.545
Don't worry.

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.880
Can you get over here.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:20.091
All right, I'll try.

01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:37.567
Put me flat.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:39.902
Here.

01:42:47.703 --> 01:42:49.036
Why didn't you leave?

01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:50.913
Go with her when
you had the chance?

01:42:51.039 --> 01:42:52.915
She'd never of gone with me.

01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:54.917
She'd have turned me down.

01:42:55.043 --> 01:42:58.588
I couldn't even get her
to open the door by myself.

01:42:58.714 --> 01:43:00.631
It was never me.

01:43:00.757 --> 01:43:02.675
Always us.

01:43:02.801 --> 01:43:05.845
Schmucko,

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:09.140
us was you.

01:43:09.266 --> 01:43:10.933
What?

01:43:11.059 --> 01:43:13.769
It was you all the time.

01:43:19.234 --> 01:43:24.238
I hope I don't die first,
is all.

01:43:27.826 --> 01:43:30.620
I think we'll go together.

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:32.246
Chances are.

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:17.875
Hey Cork?

01:44:18.001 --> 01:44:19.627
Hey, it's me.

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:22.672
I...I changed my mind.

01:44:25.133 --> 01:44:28.177
Let's give it a whack okay?
See how it goes?

01:44:28.303 --> 01:44:30.012
What do ya say?

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:35.101
I'm warning you Cork,

01:44:35.227 --> 01:44:37.019
don't play hard to get with me.

01:44:37.145 --> 01:44:38.271
'Cause I'm a woman see,

01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:40.940
and I can always
change my mind again.

01:44:45.904 --> 01:44:50.783
You may not get this
oppor-fuckin'-tunity tomorrow.
