00:18.533 --> 00:25.567
♪ ♪

00:42.433 --> 00:45.567
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:45.567 --> 00:46.600
I'm John Oliver.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.967
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:47.967 --> 00:49.800
And we must begin tonight

00:49.800 --> 00:52.100
with James Comey,
who just an hour ago,

00:52.100 --> 00:54.233
sat down for an eye-catching
interview with ABC.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.567
Now, we haven't seen it yet,

00:55.567 --> 00:57.033
because we tape this show
at 7:00,

00:57.033 --> 00:59.100
but even just the clips
this week

00:59.100 --> 01:01.033
have been tantalizing.

01:01.033 --> 01:02.567
- I start to tell him about

01:02.567 --> 01:05.367
the allegation was that he had
been involved with prostitutes

01:05.367 --> 01:08.266
in a hotel in Moscow in 2013

01:08.266 --> 01:10.266
during a visit
for the Miss Universe pageant,

01:10.266 --> 01:14.500
and that the Russians
had filmed the episode.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.500
- Really weird.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.834
- Yeah, James Comey

01:19.834 --> 01:22.633
thought that conversation
was "really weird."

01:22.633 --> 01:24.934
And I will remind you,
that this is a man

01:24.934 --> 01:28.000
who has seen
Anthony Weiner's emails.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.333
And, look, the Comey interview
is just the end

01:30.333 --> 01:33.934
of a ludicrously dramatic week
that started with this.

01:33.934 --> 01:36.066
- Breaking news tonight,
and it's a bombshell.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.800
The FBI raids the office

01:37.800 --> 01:41.166
of President Trump's
personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.433
- It's true.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.467
The President's personal lawyer
got raided.

01:44.467 --> 01:48.066
Which has apparently left Trump
"pissed, flailing, and upset"

01:48.066 --> 01:51.467
with "anger beyond
what anyone can imagine."

01:51.467 --> 01:53.066
Which is really
saying something,

01:53.066 --> 01:54.934
given that Trump's anger level
is permanently

01:54.934 --> 01:56.934
somewhere between
"child who accidentally

01:56.934 --> 01:59.400
ate a pound of cocaine throwing
a tantrum in a Kmart"

01:59.400 --> 02:02.233
and "Alec Baldwin after being
told the other party

02:02.233 --> 02:03.633
"is finishing dessert
and the table's going to be

02:03.633 --> 02:05.700
another 10 or 15 minutes."

02:05.700 --> 02:08.700
Now, Cohen dominated
the news for days,

02:08.700 --> 02:10.400
particularly when it emerged
that Donald Trump

02:10.400 --> 02:11.867
was not
the only political figure

02:11.867 --> 02:13.800
for whom he'd arranged
hush money.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.033
- Top Republican fundraiser
Elliott Broidy

02:16.033 --> 02:18.066
says Cohen negotiated
a settlement

02:18.066 --> 02:20.734
reportedly worth $1.6 million

02:20.734 --> 02:22.367
with a former
"Playboy" playmate

02:22.367 --> 02:24.000
who claims she became pregnant

02:24.000 --> 02:26.367
as a result
of a consensual affair.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.500
Today,
Broidy resigned his post.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.500
- Yes, the deputy finance chair
of the RNC cheated on his wife

02:32.500 --> 02:35.066
with a former "Playboy" model
and paid her off

02:35.066 --> 02:36.567
and has now resigned,

02:36.567 --> 02:38.533
presumably so he
can start his new job

02:38.533 --> 02:40.600
as a big ol' bullfrog
who sits on a lily pad

02:40.600 --> 02:42.467
all the doo-dah day.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.867
Now, on top of all of this,
Speaker of the House

02:44.867 --> 02:46.300
Paul Ryan
unexpectedly announced

02:46.300 --> 02:47.500
he wouldn't seek reelection,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.200
Trump pardoned Scooter Libby,

02:49.200 --> 02:51.066
and it came to light
that "The National Enquirer"

02:51.066 --> 02:52.834
may have paid a doorman
at Trump World Tower

02:52.834 --> 02:54.567
to keep quiet about rumors
that Trump had fathered

02:54.567 --> 02:57.433
a secret child with
his housekeeper in the 1980s.

02:57.433 --> 03:00.333
Oh, and on Friday night,
we bombed Syria.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.633
And look, there are those
who would argue

03:02.633 --> 03:04.166
that something had to be done

03:04.166 --> 03:06.100
in response to Assad's
suspected chemical attack.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.734
But there
are legitimate debates

03:07.734 --> 03:09.667
over whether Trump
had the authorization

03:09.667 --> 03:12.100
to order these strikes
and whether this risks

03:12.100 --> 03:14.667
drawing us
into a longer-term conflict

03:14.667 --> 03:16.433
for which we have
no clear strategy.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.066
But don't worry on that front,
because Trump

03:18.066 --> 03:21.000
has already declared
"mission accomplished,"

03:21.000 --> 03:23.633
something even Ari Fleischer,

03:23.633 --> 03:25.433
George W. Bush's
press secretary,

03:25.433 --> 03:26.700
responded to by saying,

03:26.700 --> 03:28.433
"I would have recommended
ending this tweet

03:28.433 --> 03:30.867
with not those two words."

03:30.867 --> 03:34.967
But this morning, in
a not-remotely-surprising turn,

03:34.967 --> 03:37.533
Trump doubled down
on the phrase.

03:37.533 --> 03:40.367
- President Trump defended the
use of "mission accomplished,"

03:40.367 --> 03:43.133
tweeting: "The Syrian raid was
so perfectly carried out

03:43.133 --> 03:45.400
"with such precision that the
only way the fake news media

03:45.400 --> 03:47.333
"could demean was by my use

03:47.333 --> 03:48.633
"of the term
'mission accomplished.'

03:48.633 --> 03:50.066
"I knew they would seize
on this

03:50.066 --> 03:52.000
"but felt it is such
a great military term

03:52.000 --> 03:54.800
it should be brought back.
Use often!"

03:57.367 --> 03:59.367
It does not fill you
with confidence

03:59.367 --> 04:00.967
to have a president
who announces,

04:00.967 --> 04:02.133
"I know I'm repeating one of

04:02.133 --> 04:03.500
"the most notorious
political blunders

04:03.500 --> 04:05.333
"in recent history.
I meant to do it.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.867
Everyone should do it, and I'm
gonna do it again forever."

04:08.867 --> 04:12.233
I've got to say, if Trump's
intention was to descend so far

04:12.233 --> 04:14.567
into self-parody
that he's somehow burrowed

04:14.567 --> 04:17.500
through the earth's crust
and come out the other side,

04:17.500 --> 04:20.233
mission fucking accomplished.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.667
And now, this...

04:27.400 --> 04:29.700
- I don't know how much hip-hop
you listen to.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.367
There is a famous song,
"It's Going Down in the DM."

04:32.367 --> 04:35.367
That refers to what happens
with direct messaging.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.867
You know, we're talking
about Rick Gates.

04:36.867 --> 04:39.567
I don't know if you ever listen
to the rapper Kevin Gates

04:39.567 --> 04:42.233
who says,
"All my diamonds shining

04:42.233 --> 04:43.767
'cause they're
really diamonds."

04:43.767 --> 04:46.600
Call it the Dr. Dre rule
of politics.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.200
When you diss Trump,
you diss yourself.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.100
Lauryn Hill famously said,

04:51.100 --> 04:52.834
"It ain't about what you cop,

04:52.834 --> 04:54.166
it's about what you keep."

04:54.166 --> 04:55.633
To paraphrase Kanye West,

04:55.633 --> 04:58.200
you'll have to wait
for the 35th of nevuary.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.133
The 35th of nevuary.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.467
Well, you know what
Kanye calls that

05:01.467 --> 05:03.000
is the 35th of nevuary.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.166
I'm worried
that we're gonna run out

05:04.166 --> 05:05.333
of our Kanye references.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.600
Here's how the rapper Drake

05:06.600 --> 05:08.300
explains that narrative lesson,

05:08.300 --> 05:11.266
"You can't listen to me talk
and then tell my story."

05:11.266 --> 05:14.266
"You can't listen to me talk
and go tell my story. Nah.

05:14.266 --> 05:17.200
It don't work like that
when you love somebody."

05:17.200 --> 05:19.233
There's a saying in hip-hop
that can also apply

05:19.233 --> 05:21.333
to Russian meddling.
"Can't stop, won't stop."

05:21.333 --> 05:23.700
My view is,
"I am heavy on the beat.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.266
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
tell you that?"

05:27.667 --> 05:28.767
- Word up.
- Word.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.834
- Moving on.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.934
Our main story tonight
involves taxes,

05:35.934 --> 05:38.600
essentially,
the government's GoFundMe page.

05:38.600 --> 05:43.100
Now, today is April 15, which
means you have just 45 minutes

05:43.100 --> 05:46.000
to file your taxes,
except relax. Don't panic.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
because thanks to the weekend
and a holiday,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.500
the deadline is actually
April 17th this year.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.367
Except don't relax.
Do panic.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.367
That's still not enough time
to do it right.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.266
You're fucked.
You're absolutely fucked.

05:56.266 --> 05:59.533
And you're going to jail,
Anthony.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.567
Many people are perplexed and
mystified by our tax system,

06:02.567 --> 06:05.000
perhaps best exemplified
by this Instagram video

06:05.000 --> 06:06.700
from Cardi B.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.834
- You know, the government
is taking 40% of my taxes.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.700
and, Uncle Sam, I want to know
what you are doing

06:13.700 --> 06:15.200
with my fucking tax money.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.700
what is y'all niggas doing
with my fucking money?

06:17.700 --> 06:20.133
What is y'all doing
with my fucking money?

06:20.133 --> 06:22.100
I want to know.
I want receipts.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.166
I want everything.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.200
I want to know
what y'all niggas

06:24.200 --> 06:25.533
doing with my fucking money.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.867
What is y'all niggas doing
with my fucking money.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.066
Uncle Sam,
I wanna know what the fuck

06:28.066 --> 06:29.367
y'all doing with my
motherfucking money.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.266
- Well--Well, Cardi,

06:31.266 --> 06:32.967
if you really want to know
where your money's going,

06:32.967 --> 06:35.200
may I present to you
the recently-passed

06:35.200 --> 06:39.066
omnibus spending package!

06:39.066 --> 06:40.300
Whoo!

06:42.000 --> 06:44.767
Because it turns out, Cardi,
your fuckin' money

06:44.767 --> 06:47.433
goes to your fuckin' military,
your fuckin' health care,

06:47.433 --> 06:49.266
and your fuckin'
social security

06:49.266 --> 06:51.000
and veteran
and unemployment benefits.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.233
Everything else is just some
fuckin' discretionary shit

06:53.233 --> 06:55.066
and, of course, interest.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.734
Now, as you may recall,
late last year,

06:57.734 --> 06:59.700
Republicans passed
and Donald Trump signed,

06:59.700 --> 07:01.133
a tax reform bill.

07:01.133 --> 07:03.100
And in selling it,
Trump made some clear promises

07:03.100 --> 07:04.734
about who stood to benefit.

07:04.734 --> 07:08.233
- Our focus is
on helping the folks

07:08.233 --> 07:11.533
who work in the mailrooms and
the machine shops of America.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.133
The plumbers, the carpenters,
the cops, the teachers,

07:14.133 --> 07:16.867
the truck drivers,
the pipe fitters,

07:16.867 --> 07:18.667
the people that like me best.

07:18.667 --> 07:22.400
- Well,
that's clearly nonsense.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.967
Because if this bill were
really helping the people

07:24.967 --> 07:27.567
that like Donald Trump best,
it would exclusively benefit

07:27.567 --> 07:29.500
Eric Trump, Roseanne Barr,

07:29.500 --> 07:31.066
and anyone who has
ever looked both ways

07:31.066 --> 07:34.400
before whispering,
"It was the Jews."

07:34.400 --> 07:38.934
And the truth is, for all
Trump's talk of pipe fitters,

07:38.934 --> 07:41.467
the biggest tax rate cut,
by far,

07:41.467 --> 07:43.000
actually goes to businesses,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.800
with the top
federal corporate tax rate--

07:44.800 --> 07:46.667
the tax
on a company's profits--

07:46.667 --> 07:49.867
going from 35% to just 21%.

07:49.867 --> 07:52.700
And, to be fair, many
policy makers on both sides

07:52.700 --> 07:55.066
had argued
that the 35% federal rate,

07:55.066 --> 07:57.800
among the highest in the world,
should actually come down.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
But to be even fairer,
most companies didn't pay 35%.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.200
In fact, before the bill was
signed, the effective rate--

08:04.200 --> 08:07.867
the amount companies actually
paid--was closer to 24%.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.266
And some large companies
have historically paid

08:10.266 --> 08:11.667
far less than that.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.033
You may remember
a few years ago,

08:13.033 --> 08:15.200
people were furious about this.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.433
- GE had profits of
$14.2 billion in 2010,

08:19.433 --> 08:22.633
$5 billion of that
made in the United States,

08:22.633 --> 08:25.400
but the company's expected
U.S. tax bill?

08:25.400 --> 08:28.400
A grand total of $0.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.300
- Okay,
so when the total is zero,

08:31.300 --> 08:33.934
you can't call it
a "grand total."

08:33.934 --> 08:36.533
There is literally
no total less grand,

08:36.533 --> 08:38.767
except maybe Total cereal,

08:38.767 --> 08:41.600
and that's just because
it tastes like your spoon

08:41.600 --> 08:43.734
somehow missed the cereal
and now you're just eating

08:43.734 --> 08:45.700
the box that it came in.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.834
And GE may well say,

08:47.834 --> 08:49.400
"Well, hold on.
That's just one year."

08:49.400 --> 08:53.433
But a recent study found
that between 2008 and 2015,

08:53.433 --> 08:57.667
18 large, profitable companies,
including General Electric,

08:57.667 --> 09:01.667
paid no federal income tax
at all over the entire period.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.767
None at all,
and that is a staggering total.

09:04.767 --> 09:07.500
Which is what they used to call
"Total with Raisins"

09:07.500 --> 09:09.800
until they got more honest
and changed it to

09:09.800 --> 09:12.467
"Total with Raisins
But Who Gives a Shit."

09:12.467 --> 09:15.633
So tonight,
in honor of upcoming tax day,

09:15.633 --> 09:17.467
we thought we'd give
you just a glimpse

09:17.467 --> 09:19.066
of the lengths companies
will go to

09:19.066 --> 09:22.000
to legally avoid taxes,
both here and abroad.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.567
Now, corporate tax avoidance

09:23.567 --> 09:26.266
has a long and infuriatingly
proud history.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.867
In the 1980s, for instance,
a lawyer named John Carroll Jr.

09:29.867 --> 09:33.133
came up with a tactic to move
U.S. companies offshore

09:33.133 --> 09:36.033
to avoid taxes, and his firm
celebrated him with--

09:36.033 --> 09:38.667
and this is true--
a 13-minute operetta

09:38.667 --> 09:40.633
staged in his
New York apartment.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.800
And I'll give you
just a very small taste.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.333
- Wow.

09:54.333 --> 09:57.500
We may have just found
the only musical resistant

09:57.500 --> 09:59.300
to race-blind casting.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.500
You can't go "Hamilton"
on this one,

10:01.500 --> 10:05.133
because those people
really have to be white.

10:05.133 --> 10:08.467
Now, the tax dodge being
celebrated there

10:08.467 --> 10:10.166
involved taking
an American company

10:10.166 --> 10:11.667
and headquartering it
in Panama,

10:11.667 --> 10:13.000
where taxes were lower,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.567
something its creator
called "the Panama Scoot,"

10:15.567 --> 10:17.967
which sounds like
the name of a tiny elf

10:17.967 --> 10:19.200
in a cowboy hat.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.734
"Howdy there.
My name's Panama Scoot,

10:21.734 --> 10:24.433
and I sleep in your boot!"

10:24.433 --> 10:27.133
And offshore scooting
is actually something

10:27.133 --> 10:29.600
of a common theme
in corporate tax avoidance.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.967
For decades, companies have
hunted for ways to get

10:31.967 --> 10:33.400
their money to friendlier
tax havens,

10:33.400 --> 10:34.734
like the Cayman Islands.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.667
You may remember
that during the 2012 election,

10:36.667 --> 10:39.300
it emerged that Mitt Romney
had money in companies

10:39.300 --> 10:42.367
in the Caymans, which led
to this magnificent clip

10:42.367 --> 10:44.533
of John Stossel
saying the one thing

10:44.533 --> 10:45.734
he probably
shouldn't be saying

10:45.734 --> 10:47.767
to the person he's speaking to.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.066
- Mitt Romney pays taxes

10:50.066 --> 10:53.867
and all the money earned
from the Cayman entities.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.567
- I would think it would be
like pirate heaven.

10:56.567 --> 10:59.033
Some pirate would go
and steal all the money.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.734
- Oh! Come on, Stossel!

11:02.734 --> 11:04.133
Come on!

11:04.133 --> 11:06.367
You can't say the word "pirate"

11:06.367 --> 11:08.633
to a guy with an eye patch!
You can't!

11:08.633 --> 11:10.266
It's not fair.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.166
It's like me sitting down
across from you

11:12.166 --> 11:14.400
and calling you
"Bootleg Geraldo."

11:14.400 --> 11:17.633
Yes, yes, it's obvious,
but it's also lazy and hurtful.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.367
That's an indoor thought.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.400
And tax havens have become

11:22.400 --> 11:24.767
magnets to corporations
who try and shift

11:24.767 --> 11:26.734
as much of their profits
there as possible.

11:26.734 --> 11:28.967
It's a major reason why,
in 2016,

11:28.967 --> 11:32.767
nearly 2/3 of the profits
made by American multinationals

11:32.767 --> 11:35.700
outside the U.S. were booked
in just six low

11:35.700 --> 11:37.333
or zero-tax countries.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.667
And it's a lot easier
to move profits offshore

11:39.667 --> 11:41.033
than you might think.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.800
- An increasingly popular way

11:42.800 --> 11:44.700
particularly pharmaceutical

11:44.700 --> 11:48.767
and high-tech companies like
Google avoid paying the 35%

11:48.767 --> 11:51.800
is to shift their patents,
computer code,

11:51.800 --> 11:54.166
pill formulas, even logos

11:54.166 --> 11:56.567
from their U.S. bases
to their outpost

11:56.567 --> 11:58.166
in low-tax countries.

11:58.166 --> 12:01.133
- Today, a company can move

12:01.133 --> 12:04.500
predominantly all of its assets
just on paper.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.633
- You can push a button
and move your algorithms,

12:07.633 --> 12:08.867
you know, or--
- Or Coca-Cola

12:08.867 --> 12:10.500
could take their recipe
out of the vault.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.333
- Yeah, yeah.
- And put it in a Swiss vault.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.567
- And then it's Swiss.
- Yeah.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.133
- Yeah.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.600
Coke could put their recipe
in a Swiss vault,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.333
and their profits
would move offshore.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.967
That is roughly how it works.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.467
Although for the record,
just being in a Swiss vault

12:24.467 --> 12:26.900
doesn't automatically
make something Swiss.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.200
That's why we don't call
this "Swiss gold."

12:29.200 --> 12:30.967
We call it "Nazi gold."

12:30.967 --> 12:33.200
Those are Hitler bucks,
you Swiss fucks.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.967
And this happens all the time,

12:36.967 --> 12:39.166
and the best innovators
in Weaselly accounting

12:39.166 --> 12:40.600
have arguably
been tech companies.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.700
Look at Apple.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.834
For years,
they've been deferring

12:42.834 --> 12:44.767
paying U.S. taxes
on foreign profits

12:44.767 --> 12:46.066
by stashing the money

12:46.066 --> 12:48.066
overseas
and not bringing it back,

12:48.066 --> 12:50.100
so much so that,
at the end of last year,

12:50.100 --> 12:53.800
they had $269 billion
parked overseas.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.433
And when their CEO, Tim Cook,
appeared in front of Congress

12:56.433 --> 12:59.533
a few years back, he was
very defensive about that.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.734
- We pay all the taxes we owe,

13:02.734 --> 13:04.934
every single dollar.

13:04.934 --> 13:08.033
We don't move intellectual
property offshore

13:08.033 --> 13:09.700
and use it to sell our products

13:09.700 --> 13:12.333
back to the United States
to avoid taxes.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.133
We don't stash money
on some Caribbean island.

13:16.133 --> 13:18.867
- Now, he was technically
correct there.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.433
Because Apple didn't stash

13:20.433 --> 13:22.867
their money
on a Caribbean island.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.600
They did, however,
have it stashed

13:24.600 --> 13:26.867
on this island, Ireland.

13:26.867 --> 13:30.066
Which is, it is true,
not in the Caribbean.

13:30.066 --> 13:33.133
So one word made
a lot of difference there.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.100
It's like if somebody said,
"The one thing I can promise

13:35.100 --> 13:37.400
you is that this refrigerator
is absolutely not

13:37.400 --> 13:40.266
full of severed
Caribbean heads."

13:40.266 --> 13:41.734
Maybe that is technically true,

13:41.734 --> 13:43.834
but I'm still gonna pass
on the sparkling water.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.867
And when Ireland indicated

13:45.867 --> 13:47.533
that it planned
to change its tax laws,

13:47.533 --> 13:51.066
Apple found a new shelter
for profits on this island,

13:51.066 --> 13:54.300
the Isle of Jersey, a tax haven
in the English Channel,

13:54.300 --> 13:57.133
which is, again, not
technically in the Caribbean.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.834
Although when you really
look at it,

13:58.834 --> 14:01.066
you could almost mistake it
for the Caribbean

14:01.066 --> 14:04.033
if you squint a little,
drink nine pints of beer,

14:04.033 --> 14:06.567
and hold a picture of the
Caribbean in front of it.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.166
Now, meanwhile, Google

14:08.166 --> 14:10.166
used a slightly different
tax workaround,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.767
sending its money on something
of a world tour.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.367
- Google licensed some
of the intellectual property

14:15.367 --> 14:17.100
it created here in the U.S.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.000
to a subsidiary in Ireland.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.500
But it turns out Google's
overseas profits

14:21.500 --> 14:23.200
don't even get taxed there

14:23.200 --> 14:25.867
because Google then reportedly
funnels those profits

14:25.867 --> 14:27.166
through the Netherlands

14:27.166 --> 14:30.333
and then to,
of all places, Bermuda,

14:30.333 --> 14:33.066
where the corporate
tax rate is zero.

14:33.066 --> 14:35.633
- Now, that tax trick
actually has a name.

14:35.633 --> 14:39.100
It's called the double Irish
with a Dutch sandwich,

14:39.100 --> 14:41.834
which sounds like
a disgusting sex act

14:41.834 --> 14:45.700
or an even more disgusting
Waffle House menu item.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.934
It's when someone opens up
a baked potato,

14:48.934 --> 14:51.500
farts in it, and closes
it again really quick.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.333
That's what it is.
That is exactly what it is.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.367
And when Google's CFO was asked

14:57.367 --> 14:59.100
about their tax policies
at a conference,

14:59.100 --> 15:01.934
his answer nearly got him
laughed off the stage.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.300
- We pay all our taxes
in every jurisdiction

15:05.300 --> 15:07.734
to the full extent
that the law allows us.

15:07.734 --> 15:09.433
And that's what we do.

15:09.433 --> 15:13.700
We pay every penny of tax
we owe to everybody everywhere.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.200
- Okay, the reaction
to the sentence

15:16.200 --> 15:19.834
"I pay all my taxes" should
never be incredulous laughter

15:19.834 --> 15:22.066
unless you are
a very wealthy dog

15:22.066 --> 15:24.533
who has just spoken
for the first time.

15:24.533 --> 15:27.200
And here is where I have some
good news and some bad news.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.100
The good news is
that Trump's tax bill

15:29.100 --> 15:31.367
actually forces companies
to pay taxes

15:31.367 --> 15:33.200
on all the money
they've stashed overseas.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.500
The hope is that they'll
then bring it home

15:35.500 --> 15:36.867
in something
called "repatriation."

15:36.867 --> 15:39.333
The bad news is, the tax
they're being forced to pay,

15:39.333 --> 15:41.934
which may've once been
35%, remember,

15:41.934 --> 15:45.200
has been slashed to
as little as 8% to 15%,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.900
which seems less like
a punishment

15:47.900 --> 15:50.567
and a lot more like
actively rewarding companies

15:50.567 --> 15:51.700
for tax avoidance.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.800
But Steve Mnuchin,
Treasury Secretary

15:53.800 --> 15:55.934
and objectively
good-looking man,

15:55.934 --> 15:58.567
argued that this would be
a huge benefit

15:58.567 --> 16:00.300
to America's workers.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.834
- We will have a one-time tax

16:02.834 --> 16:06.066
on overseas profits
which will bring back

16:06.066 --> 16:09.333
trillions of dollars
that are offshore

16:09.333 --> 16:12.667
to be invested here in
the United States

16:12.667 --> 16:15.467
to purchase capital
and to create jobs.

16:15.467 --> 16:17.166
- Now, I know it was hard
to pay attention

16:17.166 --> 16:19.233
to what he was saying,
'cause you just automatically

16:19.233 --> 16:21.233
undressing the guy
with your eyes,

16:21.233 --> 16:23.333
and you do it whenever
he opens his mouth.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.066
Am I right?
I'm definitely right.

16:25.066 --> 16:28.567
The guy's a California 10.
He's a smoke show.

16:28.567 --> 16:31.867
But what he's saying there is,
giving these companies

16:31.867 --> 16:34.033
a break on the taxes
they owe is worth it

16:34.033 --> 16:36.133
because it will lead
to job creation.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.367
And that is hard
to completely disprove,

16:38.367 --> 16:40.567
because anything,
theoretically,

16:40.567 --> 16:41.834
could lead to jobs.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.834
You can say
"I'm dipping this badger

16:43.834 --> 16:45.600
in fudge to create jobs."

16:45.600 --> 16:47.567
And I can't prove
that you won't create

16:47.567 --> 16:49.467
any jobs by doing that.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.367
But I would argue that,
if creating jobs

16:51.367 --> 16:54.300
is your main goal, there are
probably better ways to do it.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.133
Now, luckily,
we actually have the benefit

16:56.133 --> 16:57.967
of a test case here,
because in 2004,

16:57.967 --> 16:59.633
we basically did
the exact same thing

16:59.633 --> 17:02.433
under the American Jobs
Creation Act.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.667
It offered
a one-year tax holiday

17:04.667 --> 17:06.767
where companies could
bring back overseas profits

17:06.767 --> 17:09.200
at just a 5% tax rate.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.033
The idea was that they would
then create jobs.

17:12.033 --> 17:14.667
But when the Senate looked
at the employment numbers

17:14.667 --> 17:17.266
of the 15 companies that
brought back the most money,

17:17.266 --> 17:20.367
This is what they found:
these are the average numbers

17:20.367 --> 17:23.633
of U.S. jobs at those companies
over a five-year span.

17:23.633 --> 17:26.667
Here is where the big,
supposedly job-creating

17:26.667 --> 17:28.633
tax holiday kicked in,
and that

17:28.633 --> 17:30.633
is pretty fucking
underwhelming.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.367
I'd argue that's the most
useless, ineffective holiday

17:33.367 --> 17:36.300
since Arbor Day,
and I'm sorry, Arbor Day.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.834
But you're Secretary's Day
for trees,

17:37.834 --> 17:39.734
and we all need to accept that.

17:39.734 --> 17:42.900
In fact, instead of hiring
workers, across the board,

17:42.900 --> 17:45.400
companies mostly rewarded
their shareholders,

17:45.400 --> 17:49.300
using 94 cents out of every
dollar they brought home

17:49.300 --> 17:51.266
on stock buybacks
and dividends,

17:51.266 --> 17:53.433
something you can read about
in the bestselling book

17:53.433 --> 17:56.400
"Yeah, No Fucking Shit They
Did That" by acclaimed author

17:56.400 --> 17:59.333
"Everyone Who Knows Anything
About Corporations."

17:59.333 --> 18:01.600
And look,
for many of those companies,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.700
that may have been
the best use of their money.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.100
There is no point in hiring
people that you don't need,

18:06.100 --> 18:08.734
but the Trump administration
is fiercely insisting

18:08.734 --> 18:10.934
that this time,
their tax holiday

18:10.934 --> 18:12.600
is already creating jobs.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.633
And some companies have seemed
happy to play along.

18:15.633 --> 18:17.333
Apple put out a press release

18:17.333 --> 18:19.266
not long after the tax bill
was signed titled

18:19.266 --> 18:22.600
"Apple Accelerates U.S.
Investment and Job Creation,"

18:22.600 --> 18:25.633
bragging they were about
to create over 20,000 new jobs.

18:25.633 --> 18:28.300
And Trump was quick
to take credit.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.100
- President Trump tweeting
in response,

18:30.100 --> 18:31.467
"I promise my
policies

18:31.467 --> 18:33.200
"would allow companies
like Apple to bring

18:33.200 --> 18:35.166
"massive amounts of money back
to the United States.

18:35.166 --> 18:38.300
"Great to see Apple follow
through as a result of

18:38.300 --> 18:40.900
tax cuts."
All caps.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.600
- Okay, first, that's a solid
read from Jake Tapper there.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.633
In fact, I think all anchors
should be forced to shout

18:47.633 --> 18:50.066
whenever Trump uses
all caps in tweets.

18:50.066 --> 18:52.100
I'll show you.
This morning,

18:52.100 --> 18:53.934
the president announced
that he was,

18:53.934 --> 18:56.266
"heading to see the...
border wall...

18:56.266 --> 18:58.800
prototypes in California."

18:58.800 --> 19:03.467
or, "Today, the president
wished all Americans a...

19:03.467 --> 19:06.066
Happy Easter!"

19:06.066 --> 19:07.600
But...

19:07.600 --> 19:10.900
for all Trump's excitement,
those 20,000 Apple jobs

19:10.900 --> 19:12.533
were probably going
to happen anyway,

19:12.533 --> 19:14.734
given that the hiring
was entirely consistent

19:14.734 --> 19:16.667
with what Apple was doing
in the United States

19:16.667 --> 19:18.266
before the tax cut bill passed.

19:18.266 --> 19:20.266
and Tim Cook knows this.

19:20.266 --> 19:22.033
This is how he responded
when asked

19:22.033 --> 19:23.934
just how much
of his hiring spree

19:23.934 --> 19:26.367
was down to
Trump's new tax plan.

19:26.367 --> 19:27.934
- There are large parts of this

19:27.934 --> 19:29.800
that are a result
of the tax reform,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.367
and there's
large parts of this

19:31.367 --> 19:33.633
that we would have done
in any situation.

19:33.633 --> 19:35.967
And so I haven't spent
a lot of time

19:35.967 --> 19:37.767
in categorizing those two.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.633
Because to me
this is about America.

19:40.633 --> 19:43.834
It's not about which bucket
you put things in.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.834
- Yeah, but actually,

19:45.834 --> 19:47.934
it does matter which bucket
you put things in,

19:47.934 --> 19:50.233
because I would rather put
things in a bucket labeled

19:50.233 --> 19:52.934
"smart economic policy"
than one labeled

19:52.934 --> 19:54.867
"Put money in here.
I like money.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.166
Thanks, dummies.
Tim Cook."

19:57.166 --> 19:59.433
And look,
there are legitimate debates

19:59.433 --> 20:02.500
over how and how much we
should tax corporate profits,

20:02.500 --> 20:05.200
but we just had a huge chance
to reform our tax code.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.467
And we absolutely blew it,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.300
because effective tax reform

20:09.300 --> 20:11.100
is not just
about lowering rates.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.266
It's about closing loopholes.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.734
For instance, one reasonable
idea raised last year

20:15.734 --> 20:18.300
was forcing companies
to pay a minimum tax

20:18.300 --> 20:20.600
in every single country
they operate in.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.066
It's a bit complicated,

20:22.066 --> 20:24.867
but that may well have reduced
their abuse of tax havens.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.767
But that proposal never even
got out of committee.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.166
So the result here is
that our tax code is still

20:30.166 --> 20:32.533
full of loopholes,
and however much Trump talked

20:32.533 --> 20:36.233
about how tax reform would
benefit cops and pipe fitters,

20:36.233 --> 20:38.934
it's worth knowing that once
he got behind closed doors,

20:38.934 --> 20:41.000
his message seemed to change.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.200
- We're told the president
is still celebrating

20:43.200 --> 20:45.567
passage of the Republican
tax cut bill.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.367
Sources
with firsthand knowledge

20:47.367 --> 20:50.700
tells CBS news that he told
a group of wealthy people

20:50.700 --> 20:53.200
at his exclusive
Mar-a-Lago estate,

20:53.200 --> 20:56.633
"You all just got
a lot richer."

20:56.633 --> 20:58.200
- That's right.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.133
So on Tuesday, as you scrape
together your taxes,

21:01.133 --> 21:03.600
and, like Cardi B, wonder
what Uncle Sam is doing

21:03.600 --> 21:06.066
with your
motherfucking money,

21:06.066 --> 21:08.467
rest assured that
Donald Trump's tax reform

21:08.467 --> 21:10.467
continues
to let companies engage

21:10.467 --> 21:12.266
in sophisticated
tax-avoidance schemes.

21:12.266 --> 21:14.533
And to those companies,
I say this.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.066
On behalf of America,

21:16.066 --> 21:19.700
please enjoy this double Irish
with a Dutch sandwich.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.467
I made it for you myself.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.400
Eat it while it's hot.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.967
And now, this.

21:31.734 --> 21:33.967
- But the press
may need to rethink

21:33.967 --> 21:37.166
this approach and take
some advice from Jay-Z.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.133
"We know
the pain is real,

21:39.133 --> 21:42.600
but you can't heal
what you never reveal."

21:42.600 --> 21:44.367
I don't know how much
you listen to Jay-Z,

21:44.367 --> 21:46.233
but you know he said,
"If money talks,

21:46.233 --> 21:48.166
the whole world is about
to hear me out."

21:48.166 --> 21:50.633
As Jay-Z would say, "Either
love me or leave me alone."

21:50.633 --> 21:54.233
As you know Jay-Z says, "What's
better than one billionaire?

21:54.233 --> 21:55.266
Two."

21:55.266 --> 21:57.600
As Jay-Z said, "Men lie,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.533
women lie,
numbers don't lie."

21:59.533 --> 22:01.667
A wise man told me,
"Don't argue with fools,

22:01.667 --> 22:04.967
'cause people from a distance
can't tell who is who."

22:04.967 --> 22:06.834
"I plead the fifth
when it comes to the fam."

22:06.834 --> 22:08.100
"I'm like a dog.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.100
I never speak,
but I understand."

22:10.100 --> 22:12.967
"I'm not a businessman.
I'm a business, man."

22:12.967 --> 22:15.000
Jay-Z always says,
"The streets is watching."

22:15.000 --> 22:17.066
"The streets is watching."
"The street is watching."

22:17.066 --> 22:18.734
- Also, nobody mentioned
reasonable doubt.

22:18.734 --> 22:20.333
You have to acquit.

22:26.066 --> 22:27.433
- Moving on.

22:27.433 --> 22:31.367
Finally tonight,
we'd like to talk about Alaska,

22:31.367 --> 22:33.166
the state we purchased
from the grizzly bears

22:33.166 --> 22:34.433
for 50 pounds of salmon.

22:34.433 --> 22:37.033
You stupid fucking bears.

22:37.033 --> 22:39.500
Now, specifically,
we're going to take a look

22:39.500 --> 22:42.266
at one of Alaska's
endangered resources.

22:42.266 --> 22:44.533
- One of Alaska's last
Blockbuster stores

22:44.533 --> 22:46.467
is closing
to retail sales today.

22:46.467 --> 22:49.000
The latest closure follows
multiple Blockbusters

22:49.000 --> 22:51.166
shutting their doors
for good in the past year.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.467
The North Pole Blockbuster
closed in March,

22:53.467 --> 22:55.333
the Wasilla store in January,

22:55.333 --> 22:58.033
and the Eagle River location
last July.

22:58.033 --> 22:59.367
- Wow.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.200
We seem to be rapidly
losing something

23:01.200 --> 23:04.667
I didn't even know we had,
which is a weird feeling.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.800
it's like if Bigfoot
walked out of the woods

23:06.800 --> 23:08.834
with a gun to his head,
saying he exists,

23:08.834 --> 23:11.200
there were four of him,
but he just brutally murdered

23:11.200 --> 23:13.700
his wife and two kids and he's
not feeling great about it.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.166
Please don't do it, Bigfoot!

23:15.166 --> 23:16.433
We'll give you a second chance

23:16.433 --> 23:19.266
if you just let us look
at your big, weird feet!

23:19.266 --> 23:20.367
But it's true.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.734
Despite the fact
that Blockbuster

23:21.734 --> 23:23.700
filed for bankruptcy in 2010,

23:23.700 --> 23:27.100
there are apparently four
independently owned franchises

23:27.100 --> 23:29.166
still operating in the U.S.,

23:29.166 --> 23:30.800
three of which are in Alaska,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.734
which actually makes
a little bit of sense.

23:32.734 --> 23:34.934
Because internet coverage
is sparse up there,

23:34.934 --> 23:37.734
and without unlimited data,
streaming has been expensive.

23:37.734 --> 23:39.934
And to listen to an employee
at one of those stores,

23:39.934 --> 23:42.467
their very presence
is almost magical.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.600
- I have people who come
into the parking lot

23:44.600 --> 23:45.967
just to take pictures
of the building,

23:45.967 --> 23:48.333
people who come in
and they'll walk around,

23:48.333 --> 23:49.934
like "Whoa."

23:49.934 --> 23:51.333
And you know that person

23:51.333 --> 23:53.200
hasn't been in a Blockbuster
in a long time.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.066
You can just tell because
they'll also be like,

23:55.066 --> 23:58.300
"Oh, my god, I can't believe
you guys are still here!"

23:58.300 --> 24:00.266
- What a fun

24:00.266 --> 24:01.900
but potentially
passive-aggressive

24:01.900 --> 24:03.266
interaction that was.

24:03.266 --> 24:05.667
"wow, I thought you has-been
losers had been thrown

24:05.667 --> 24:07.166
"into the trash heap
of history!

24:07.166 --> 24:08.967
"But you weren't!
Good for you!

24:08.967 --> 24:11.266
"I'm off to stream literally
anything I want!

24:11.266 --> 24:13.834
See ya later, punchline!"

24:13.834 --> 24:15.767
But as internet coverage
improves,

24:15.767 --> 24:17.333
those few remaining
Alaskan Blockbusters

24:17.333 --> 24:18.867
are under serious threat.

24:18.867 --> 24:22.200
If only there were a fun,
movie-themed way

24:22.200 --> 24:23.967
for them to draw people
in, you know,

24:23.967 --> 24:25.900
the way that planet Hollywood
sucks you in

24:25.900 --> 24:28.400
with the chance to dine
alongside the baseball mitt

24:28.400 --> 24:31.000
that out-acted Madonna
in "A League of Their Own"

24:31.000 --> 24:33.066
or Patrick Swayze's
clay erection

24:33.066 --> 24:36.233
from the movie "Ghost"
or Tom Cruise's original wife.

24:36.233 --> 24:39.166
You know, incredible pieces
of movie history.

24:39.166 --> 24:42.200
The problem is, there's no way
for a Blockbuster in Alaska

24:42.200 --> 24:43.934
to get memorabilia like that.

24:43.934 --> 24:45.900
Or is there?

24:45.900 --> 24:48.233
Because a few weeks ago,
you may remember we told you

24:48.233 --> 24:50.367
about "Russell Crowe:
The Art of Divorce,"

24:50.367 --> 24:51.767
an auction in which,

24:51.767 --> 24:53.166
to celebrate
the end of his marriage,

24:53.166 --> 24:55.600
he was selling artifacts
from his career,

24:55.600 --> 24:57.200
from the "Gladiator" chariot

24:57.200 --> 24:59.066
to this leather jockstrap

24:59.066 --> 25:01.100
he wore in the film
"Cinderella Man,"

25:01.100 --> 25:02.467
which was expected to attract

25:02.467 --> 25:05.800
an absolutely ridiculous $500.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.166
Well, the auction took place
last weekend,

25:08.166 --> 25:09.400
and you'll be glad to know

25:09.400 --> 25:12.834
that no one paid $500
for that jockstrap.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.533
- One of the more curious items

25:14.533 --> 25:16.967
that went under the hammer
was a leather groin protector

25:16.967 --> 25:19.533
used by Crowe in the film
"Cinderella Man."

25:19.533 --> 25:22.533
It sold for $7,000
to a telephone bidder.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.967
It's not clear what they plan
to use it for.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.000
- Holy shit.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.233
$7,000!

25:30.233 --> 25:32.567
That is a big price to pay
just to find out

25:32.567 --> 25:35.567
what Russell Crowe's
balls smelled like in 2005.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.934
I'm guessing lilacs with just
a hint of spoiled venison.

25:38.934 --> 25:40.433
Now, you should know,

25:40.433 --> 25:42.300
that there's been some
speculation out there

25:42.300 --> 25:44.600
that we were the ones
who bought the jockstrap.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.233
And I will admit,
it does sound like something

25:47.233 --> 25:48.533
that we would do.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.834
You know,
buy Russell Crowe's jockstrap

25:50.834 --> 25:52.433
and send it
to one of the last remaining

25:52.433 --> 25:53.800
Blockbusters in Alaska.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.000
Even that sentence
is absolutely incredible

25:56.000 --> 25:57.333
to say out loud.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.667
The bad news is,
we didn't do it.

25:59.667 --> 26:02.133
I'm sorry.
It wasn't us.

26:02.133 --> 26:03.633
We didn't buy it.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.033
We did though.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.433
We did.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.000
We absolutely did.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.000
Are you not entertained?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.166
Are you not entertained?

26:18.166 --> 26:20.834
Now, what we didn't do,

26:20.834 --> 26:22.800
what we didn't do,

26:22.800 --> 26:25.834
what we did not do is buy
anything else at the auction.

26:28.433 --> 26:30.567
Except we did though.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.600
Because what happened was,
let me explain,

26:32.600 --> 26:35.467
it was 4:00 a.m. over here,
and you know what happens

26:35.467 --> 26:37.367
when you start online shopping
late at night.

26:37.367 --> 26:38.967
You wake up the next day
and you think,

26:38.967 --> 26:41.400
"Oh, shit,
what did I just buy?"

26:41.400 --> 26:44.266
Well, this was very much
one of those times.

26:44.266 --> 26:47.100
Because we didn't just get
a jockstrap.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.033
We got a bunch of pointless
Russell Crowe memorabilia,

26:50.033 --> 26:52.133
and I can think of no more
fitting place

26:52.133 --> 26:54.867
for them to reside than
an Alaskan Blockbuster.

26:54.867 --> 26:57.600
So please join me
for a guided tour.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.333
First--come with me.

27:00.333 --> 27:04.300
First, there is Russell Crowe's
director's chair

27:04.300 --> 27:05.834
from the film
"American Gangster,"

27:05.834 --> 27:08.300
a movie I had completely
forgotten he was in.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.233
But he obviously remembered,

27:10.233 --> 27:12.867
because he not only took
the back from his chair,

27:12.867 --> 27:15.333
he took the one from
Denzel Washington's as well.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.533
Which obviously we also bought.

27:17.533 --> 27:20.066
Now--by the way,

27:20.066 --> 27:21.800
Denzel Washington's cost
more than his.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.033
Now, you're probably thinking:

27:24.033 --> 27:25.934
Well, do you have one
of Russell Crowe's

27:25.934 --> 27:27.266
iconic movie costumes?

27:27.266 --> 27:29.700
You know, something
from the movie "Gladiator"?

27:29.700 --> 27:33.300
Well, no, but only because
we got something even better,

27:33.300 --> 27:35.900
The vest he wore in
"Les Misérables"!

27:35.900 --> 27:37.867
Oh, yes,

27:37.867 --> 27:41.800
a movie which "Tacky Vest
Weekly" called "a triumph!"

27:41.800 --> 27:43.200
And that's not
the only costume.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.367
Because we also got this hood

27:45.367 --> 27:48.300
that he wore
in 2010's "Robin Hood,"

27:48.300 --> 27:51.233
which looks like something
a circumcised penis

27:51.233 --> 27:53.266
would wear to administer
a lethal injection.

27:53.266 --> 27:55.300
And finally, we all know

27:55.300 --> 27:57.500
that Russell Crowe wore
a leather jockstrap

27:57.500 --> 27:58.867
in the film
"Cinderella Man."

27:58.867 --> 28:01.967
And it is famously worth
$7,000.

28:01.967 --> 28:05.000
But that movie
also apparently featured

28:05.000 --> 28:07.967
this satin robe and gym shorts!

28:07.967 --> 28:10.834
I presume it did.

28:10.834 --> 28:12.367
I presume it
featured them.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.300
To be honest, I've never seen
"Cinderella Man,"

28:14.300 --> 28:17.033
despite now owning thousands
of dollars' worth

28:17.033 --> 28:18.533
of props from it,
and to be honest,

28:18.533 --> 28:19.934
I'm never going to see it.

28:19.934 --> 28:22.533
It is $13 on amazon.

28:22.533 --> 28:26.367
Why would I pay $13 to own
the movie "Cinderella Man"?

28:26.367 --> 28:28.934
That's an unforgivable waste
of money.

28:28.934 --> 28:30.700
Besides,
I don't need to see it.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.934
I've seen the jockstrap.
I basically get it.

28:32.934 --> 28:36.033
The point here is,
to the manager of the only

28:36.033 --> 28:38.100
remaining Blockbuster
in Anchorage, Alaska,

28:38.100 --> 28:40.400
at 5600 Debarr Road,
number five,

28:40.400 --> 28:42.767
all of this shit
is yours.

28:42.767 --> 28:46.300
Just call us
in the next 48 hours,

28:46.300 --> 28:48.300
and we will send it to you.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.133
And I really hope the Internet
is good enough up there

28:51.133 --> 28:52.333
for you to see this in time,

28:52.333 --> 28:54.066
because if we do not
hear from you

28:54.066 --> 28:57.266
in the next two days,
I know a transportation museum

28:57.266 --> 28:58.900
in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

28:58.900 --> 29:01.400
that I'm sure could make room
for a new exhibit.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.767
That's our show!
Thank you so much for watching!

29:03.767 --> 29:05.200
See you next week!

29:05.200 --> 29:06.667
Good night!

29:06.667 --> 29:08.700
Are you not entertained?

29:08.700 --> 29:10.834
Are you not entertained?
