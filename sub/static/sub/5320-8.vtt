WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:02.548
All right, Taco Corp has taken

00:02.600 --> 00:04.050
a little bit of a hit with
the whole drone situation.

00:04.102 --> 00:05.551
However,

00:05.603 --> 00:08.289
EBDB Prime is still
in full swing, guys.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.026
Deliver anything you want,

00:10.111 --> 00:11.494
any time of day or night.

00:11.529 --> 00:12.611
Can you deliver me a new team?

00:12.697 --> 00:14.413
Because I lost
to Jenny last week,

00:14.499 --> 00:15.865
and it's driving me bananas.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.668
I mean, Golden Tate
gets 98 yards.

00:18.703 --> 00:21.337
If he falls forward, he gets
a hundred yards, and I win.

00:21.372 --> 00:23.456
If I saw that dude, I'd
punch him in the face.

00:23.541 --> 00:25.624
KEVIN: Oh, you'd Percy
Harvin Golden Tate?

00:25.710 --> 00:27.677
Yeah, and I wouldn't even
pretend to get migraines either.

00:27.712 --> 00:28.844
PETE:
I lost last week.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.296
You don't see me bitching
about it, okay?

00:30.381 --> 00:31.547
You lost to the Coin.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.299
You lost to a random flip

00:33.384 --> 00:34.684
of a metallic object.

00:34.719 --> 00:36.052
Yeah, I lost to the coin, too.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.553
Swallowed a penny last week.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.055
I couldn't poop for days.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.690
When your bench outscores
your starters

00:40.725 --> 00:42.892
two weeks in a row,
it's time to make some changes.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.810
So from now on,
all my fantasy decisions

00:44.896 --> 00:47.029
will be made
by the flip of a coin.

00:47.065 --> 00:48.114
What?!

00:48.199 --> 00:49.231
What do you mean,
all your decisions?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.117
Yes, try me.

00:51.202 --> 00:52.368
All right, Pete, I'd like
to propose a trade.

00:52.403 --> 00:53.486
Talk to the Coin.

00:53.571 --> 00:55.237
You trade me Marcus Mariota

00:55.323 --> 00:57.990
and I will give you my kicker,
Justin Tucker.

00:58.076 --> 00:59.677
KEVIN: No.
ANDRE: Wait, Pete, that's, no.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.576
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Pete, Pete,

01:00.628 --> 01:01.711
come on, he's tricking you.

01:01.746 --> 01:03.245
You can't do that. No way.
Pete.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.381
Coin says yes, trade approved.

01:05.416 --> 01:06.256
What?! For real?
Yeah.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.249
You're gonna do that trade?

01:07.335 --> 01:09.168
Coin speaks, I listen.

01:09.253 --> 01:10.970
I just Justin Tuckered you, man.

01:11.055 --> 01:13.139
We'll see what happens.
Loving that trade.

01:13.224 --> 01:15.224
And I'm loving my
match-up against Kevin

01:15.259 --> 01:17.226
in Cook County Court this week.

01:17.261 --> 01:19.095
Wait, you're going up
against Ruxin?

01:19.180 --> 01:21.514
This guy is representing
an asshole.

01:21.599 --> 01:22.982
Mr. Rivers is a complicated man.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.266
He's a slumlord

01:24.352 --> 01:26.352
whose apartment building
has asbestos in it,

01:26.437 --> 01:27.770
and this man refuses
to remove it.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.321
RUXIN:
I would argue that

01:29.407 --> 01:31.524
your clients have been smuggling
asbestos out in their lungs,

01:31.609 --> 01:33.109
and I might
countersue for theft.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.360
ANDRE:
Kevin's totally right.

01:34.445 --> 01:35.828
All building owners
are total assholes.

01:35.913 --> 01:37.446
What's going on with you?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.115
My garage is under construction.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.866
So?
So?

01:40.952 --> 01:42.273
So, there's no parking
in my area,

01:42.286 --> 01:43.586
so I have to park, like,
a half a mile away.

01:43.621 --> 01:45.254
Who cares?
So what? The entrance to the lot

01:45.289 --> 01:47.373
is, like, all uneven,
and my undercarriage

01:47.458 --> 01:49.759
is getting ripped up
on a nightly basis.

01:49.794 --> 01:50.960
What?
I'm back in.

01:51.012 --> 01:53.012
My undercarriage
is taking a beating

01:53.097 --> 01:55.097
every single night,
and I can't take it anymore.

01:55.133 --> 01:56.465
Really? How's your tailpipe?

01:56.517 --> 01:57.466
Oh, my tailpipe

01:57.518 --> 01:58.801
is just getting hammered, too.

01:58.853 --> 01:59.802
It's like pow,
pow-pow, pow-pow.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.187
Sounds like your whole rear end

02:01.272 --> 02:02.772
is getting a ton of action.

02:02.807 --> 02:04.223
Yeah, but not the type
of action you want.

02:04.308 --> 02:06.692
I mean, my undercarriage
is getting abused.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.810
'Cause you don't like
the rough stuff.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.979
No, I want a nice, smooth entry.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.730
There is the whole concept
of using protection.

02:11.816 --> 02:13.282
There are these rubber tubes
that you can put

02:13.317 --> 02:14.617
over your tailpipe
that kind of protect it

02:14.652 --> 02:16.118
from anything untoward
getting in there.

02:16.154 --> 02:17.987
I don't want to put a rubber
on my tailpipe, you know?

02:18.072 --> 02:19.655
I like my car to be
able to feel the road.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.906
Yeah.
Mm.

02:20.992 --> 02:22.291
Andre's undercarriage
is getting damaged

02:22.326 --> 02:24.960
'cause of all the sex
he's having in his butt.

02:25.029 --> 02:25.726
Yeah.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.881
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:31.216 --> 02:32.668
ANDRE:
Ridiculous.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.587
Sucks.

02:35.741 --> 02:37.389
Come on!

02:37.475 --> 02:38.571
What?

02:38.691 --> 02:40.676
Can I park here or not?

02:43.231 --> 02:45.347
(groans)

02:46.267 --> 02:47.483
Oh! Aah!

02:47.518 --> 02:49.101
Aah!

02:51.022 --> 02:51.904
No!

02:51.989 --> 02:52.822
No! No!

02:52.857 --> 02:54.356
No!

02:54.442 --> 02:55.774
MAN:
Excuse me, sir.

02:55.860 --> 02:56.820
Are you in need of help?

02:56.828 --> 02:58.661
I can't find a space.

02:58.696 --> 03:00.246
We have space for you.

03:00.331 --> 03:01.697
Really?

03:01.749 --> 03:03.249
We have a parking lot
right across the street.

03:03.334 --> 03:04.583
Find yourself a parking space

03:04.669 --> 03:05.835
and come on in.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.786
(speaking Korean)

03:07.872 --> 03:09.288
Thank you so much for this.

03:09.373 --> 03:11.423
You sure it's okay to park
in your parking space?

03:11.509 --> 03:12.925
For tonight, it's okay.

03:13.010 --> 03:14.927
Usually it's reserved
for members of the congregation.

03:15.012 --> 03:16.762
Uh, I'd like to join
your congregation.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.264
Well, let me get you
a parking pass.

03:18.349 --> 03:20.099
Halleluiah!

03:20.184 --> 03:21.350
(pastor speaks Korean)

03:21.385 --> 03:23.802
♪ Free parking! Halleluiah! ♪

03:23.888 --> 03:25.471
♪ Free parking! ♪

03:25.556 --> 03:26.939
♪ Halleluiah! ♪

03:27.024 --> 03:28.724
God bless this parking lot!

03:28.776 --> 03:31.727
(yawns)

03:31.779 --> 03:33.729
(rain falling)

03:33.781 --> 03:35.231
You know, babe,

03:35.283 --> 03:37.233
I know it is not Wednesday,

03:37.318 --> 03:40.903
but what if it was
missionary Monday?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.992
Oh.

03:47.078 --> 03:48.911
(sighs)

03:50.414 --> 03:52.248
(thunder rumbling)

03:56.470 --> 04:00.055
My love, you look
so beautiful in this...

04:00.091 --> 04:02.925
big shirt.

04:05.146 --> 04:07.012
(groans)

04:10.401 --> 04:11.600
PETE:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

04:11.686 --> 04:13.102
What?!
Who does this?

04:13.154 --> 04:15.938
Oh, come on, you guys have
never done sleep sex before?

04:15.990 --> 04:16.822
No!
Come on.

04:16.908 --> 04:17.990
No one does that.

04:18.075 --> 04:19.692
I'm married, right?

04:19.777 --> 04:21.694
You never tried to sneak
in the side door?

04:21.779 --> 04:23.445
Yeah, of course I've done
the spoon slip.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.330
Thank you.
But she's conscious

04:24.415 --> 04:25.698
to say, "No, Ruxin.

04:25.783 --> 04:27.283
Go downstairs
and watch your tape."

04:27.335 --> 04:28.167
Oh.

04:28.252 --> 04:29.785
This is, like, Cosby-esque.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.121
It is not Cosby-esque,
thank you.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.956
At least he has the dignity
to serve them a drink.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.791
Yeah, I mean, I've heard of
"you snooze, you lose,"

04:35.843 --> 04:37.876
but with you, they really lose.

04:37.962 --> 04:39.628
(chuckles)
TACO: I don't see a problem with it.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.964
Thank you. Women have sex with me
all the time while I'm sleeping.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.599
What?
How?

04:43.634 --> 04:45.235
Well, I'm fully erect
while I'm sleeping.

04:45.269 --> 04:46.602
You guys aren't?
No. No.

04:46.637 --> 04:48.103
How do you keep from
rolling out of bed?

04:48.139 --> 04:50.055
Oh, I'm gonna fall out. Nope.

04:50.141 --> 04:50.973
Oh, I'm gonna
fall out. Nope.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.141
You got to be kidding me.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.692
Marcus Mariota is injured?

04:53.778 --> 04:55.110
Okay!

04:55.146 --> 04:56.195
Ooh, looks like that trade

04:56.280 --> 04:57.479
worked out for somebody.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.481
Guys, the Coin abides,
I'm telling you.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.649
I'm thinking about applying this

05:00.735 --> 05:02.284
to all of my real-life decisions
as well.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.986
I smell something rancid here.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.831
What's that you're getting
a whiff of, Ruxin?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.122
Come on, Ruxin, what's happening
behind your back?

05:07.158 --> 05:08.207
Coin collusion.

05:08.292 --> 05:09.875
That doesn't exist.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.160
It's like I went
to bed last night

05:11.245 --> 05:13.045
and a coin just slipped
right in next to me,

05:13.130 --> 05:15.214
and I wake up in the morning,
and I'm sore,

05:15.299 --> 05:18.091
and there's a bunch of pennies
right around my waist.

05:21.871 --> 05:23.120
PETE:
<i>Well, Haddock put us</i>

05:23.205 --> 05:24.455
through another
leadership seminar today.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.540
We are so focused
on leadership skills.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.175
America needs to focus more
on followship skills.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.878
Yeah.
Oh, shit. That's Golden Tate, guys.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.429
PETE: Hey, Golden,
what are you doing here?

05:32.515 --> 05:34.965
It's my bye week, and I figured
I'd come hang out in Chicago,

05:35.051 --> 05:36.600
and once Taco figured out
I wasn't a cereal,

05:36.685 --> 05:38.635
he hit me up.

05:38.721 --> 05:40.471
Yeah, I'm as surprised
as you guys are.

05:40.556 --> 05:41.855
What'd I tell you, Ruxin?

05:41.891 --> 05:43.057
EBDB Prime delivers.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.191
You wanted to punch Golden Tate

05:44.226 --> 05:45.309
in the face?

05:45.394 --> 05:46.443
(chuckles)
Here he is.

05:46.529 --> 05:47.644
Hello, Ruxin.

05:47.730 --> 05:48.896
Hi, Golden.

05:48.981 --> 05:49.980
I didn't want to...

05:50.066 --> 05:51.648
punch you in the face.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.400
I mean, that'd be cra...
Pete, back me up on this.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.985
Right?
(sighs)

05:55.071 --> 05:56.236
Oh, he said it.

05:56.288 --> 05:57.204
KEVIN: Ooh...
Mm.

05:57.239 --> 05:58.539
RUXIN:
Okay, yes.

05:58.574 --> 05:59.740
It's just that you kind
of under delivered

05:59.825 --> 06:00.958
for me in fantasy this week.

06:01.043 --> 06:02.576
Under delivered?

06:02.661 --> 06:03.827
I had 98 yards.

06:03.913 --> 06:05.079
And I needed a hundred.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.331
So you kind of
shit the bed for me,

06:07.416 --> 06:08.715
and since your bed is
right next to my bed,

06:08.751 --> 06:10.050
you kind of shat up my bed.

06:10.086 --> 06:11.885
I am nowhere near your bed.

06:11.921 --> 06:13.754
I hate when you fantasy people
try to tell me

06:13.806 --> 06:14.972
how to do my job.

06:15.057 --> 06:16.590
Fantasy players are the worst.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.143
How would you like if I turned
your livelihood into a game?

06:19.228 --> 06:21.345
Well, it just so happens
that Kevin and Ruxin

06:21.430 --> 06:23.263
have a match-up in
court this week.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.349
TATE: You might be onto something.
TACO: Yeah.

06:25.434 --> 06:28.352
What do you think about
a workplace fantasy league?

06:28.437 --> 06:30.487
Ooh, workplace fantasy league.

06:30.573 --> 06:31.989
I love it! Which
one's your pick?

06:32.074 --> 06:32.823
Oh.

06:32.908 --> 06:34.575
I'll take Ruxin.
What?

06:34.610 --> 06:36.443
Doesn't look like much,
but I'm sure he get vicious

06:36.529 --> 06:38.028
once the suit goes on.

06:38.114 --> 06:40.080
Well, I guess that leaves me
with this guy.

06:40.116 --> 06:41.498
I don't mind being the underdog.

06:41.584 --> 06:42.833
PETE: Might not want to
sleep with him, though.

06:42.918 --> 06:45.419
His wife did that,
kind of regretted it.

06:45.454 --> 06:47.788
All right, workplace fantasy week one.
(whoops)

06:47.840 --> 06:50.124
I expect some good trash talk
on my MyFace board.

06:50.176 --> 06:50.958
Plenty of it.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.127
All right.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.595
Ha. No.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.213
Taco.

06:56.298 --> 06:58.182
Come on. Oh, my God.

06:58.267 --> 06:59.466
Will you stop it.
What?

06:59.518 --> 07:01.685
KEVIN:
<i>How was your day, babe?</i>

07:01.770 --> 07:02.970
Good, how are you?

07:03.022 --> 07:04.138
Mm. I'm good.
Yeah?

07:04.190 --> 07:05.389
Um, just wanted to go over

07:05.474 --> 07:08.859
something with you,
mm, last night.

07:08.944 --> 07:10.360
First of all,
you looked beautiful.

07:10.446 --> 07:12.529
Thank you.
And, you know, we started to kind of

07:12.615 --> 07:14.982
kiss a little bit and then...

07:15.034 --> 07:17.534
it was just sort of like
we were in a car together

07:17.620 --> 07:18.952
and we were going
to go on a trip

07:18.988 --> 07:20.154
and then I looked over
and you just fell asleep,

07:20.239 --> 07:22.990
so I figured, "Mm...

07:23.042 --> 07:25.826
Maybe I'll just, like,
drive around for a while."

07:25.911 --> 07:27.995
Sleep sex.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.246
Yes.

07:29.331 --> 07:30.414
I am sorry.

07:30.499 --> 07:31.665
That was not cool,

07:31.750 --> 07:33.250
and I will never try
to have sex with you

07:33.335 --> 07:34.585
while you're asleep again.

07:34.670 --> 07:35.802
Thank you.

07:35.838 --> 07:36.920
But I wasn't asleep.

07:37.006 --> 07:37.921
Excuse me?

07:38.007 --> 07:39.173
I wasn't asleep.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.340
I thought you knew...

07:40.426 --> 07:41.341
How would I know
that you weren't...

07:41.393 --> 07:42.509
What...?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.595
I mean, my eyes were closed,
I was so tired,

07:44.680 --> 07:46.396
but I just figured
I'd go along with it.

07:46.482 --> 07:48.515
Really? Just go along with it?
Yes.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.516
The bigger question, Kevin,

07:49.602 --> 07:50.901
is why you would keep going

07:50.986 --> 07:52.686
if you thought I was asleep.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.521
Uh, because you moaned.

07:54.573 --> 07:55.939
I mean, I kissed your neck
and then you moaned,

07:56.025 --> 07:57.658
so I was like, "Oh, oop,
here we go, let's do it."

07:57.693 --> 07:59.193
Yeah. I moaned
'cause I was like,

07:59.278 --> 08:01.195
"Oh, Jesus,
let's just do it."

08:01.280 --> 08:03.030
I don't know the difference
in the moans.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.781
I mean, they're kind of
the same moan. I get it.

08:04.867 --> 08:06.583
You couldn't be bothered
to open your eyes,

08:06.669 --> 08:07.701
roll over...

08:07.753 --> 08:09.169
I mean, that's, like,

08:09.205 --> 08:10.254
the definition of phoning it in.

08:10.339 --> 08:11.955
Are you mad at me right now?

08:12.041 --> 08:13.540
A-A little bit.
I'm a little hurt.

08:13.592 --> 08:15.259
Y... You know what?

08:15.344 --> 08:16.927
This is embarrassing.
You think?

08:17.012 --> 08:18.428
I mean, is this the first time

08:18.514 --> 08:20.047
that you've ever done
this whole... (snores)

08:20.099 --> 08:21.798
Is this the first time
you've done this?

08:21.884 --> 08:22.599
Yes.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.301
Me, too.

08:24.386 --> 08:25.686
Okay.

08:25.721 --> 08:26.603
Okay.

08:26.689 --> 08:27.471
First time.

08:33.895 --> 08:36.647
So, it turns out she wasn't sleeping.
Really?

08:36.732 --> 08:39.232
So I told you guys,
I didn't Cosby her.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.284
No, you're just so boring at sex

08:41.370 --> 08:43.370
that your wife would rather
pretend to be asleep

08:43.405 --> 08:45.072
than openly witness

08:45.124 --> 08:47.124
you jackhammering away at her.
Okay.

08:47.209 --> 08:48.709
Enough.
Does Pete make you do that?

08:48.744 --> 08:50.244
Let's just...
If she were asleep,

08:50.296 --> 08:51.576
you could put a Pete mask on her

08:51.580 --> 08:52.796
and she wouldn't even know.

08:52.881 --> 08:54.248
Can we just get back
to the issue at hand,

08:54.300 --> 08:55.415
which is beating the Coin?

08:55.501 --> 08:56.800
We gotta beat this Coin.

08:56.885 --> 08:58.218
Yes. Your job this week.

08:58.254 --> 08:59.169
I need your help.

08:59.255 --> 09:00.254
How can I help?

09:00.339 --> 09:01.722
I need Philip Rivers.

09:01.757 --> 09:03.307
What am I, just gonna put him
on the waiver wire?

09:03.392 --> 09:04.424
What are you gonna do?

09:04.476 --> 09:05.559
I've got priority
on the waiver wire.

09:05.594 --> 09:07.561
All season long,
you guys make fun of me,

09:07.596 --> 09:08.979
calling me
the waiver miser--

09:09.064 --> 09:11.148
which I think, by the way,
is slightly anti-Semitic--

09:11.233 --> 09:13.350
Mm.
but right now, it's gonna pay off.

09:13.435 --> 09:15.102
You want me just
to dump Philip Rivers?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.437
I mean, I-I can do that,
because I also have Drew Brees.

09:17.489 --> 09:19.273
Whoa, you have Drew Brees
and Philip Rivers?

09:19.358 --> 09:21.241
Yes, because I have
foresight, Ruxin.

09:21.277 --> 09:22.359
I think it's hindsight

09:22.444 --> 09:24.278
to a great lineup in 2010.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.079
If I do dump Rivers,

09:26.115 --> 09:27.447
you better deliver that Coin.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.449
Oh, trust me.
If you give me Rivers,

09:29.535 --> 09:31.118
I will deliver the Coin to you.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.669
And no one can
find out about this.

09:32.755 --> 09:33.870
No one.

09:33.956 --> 09:36.623
If anyone hears about it,
deny, deny, deny.

09:36.675 --> 09:38.125
Cosby style.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.960
♪ ♪

09:47.686 --> 09:49.519
Andre?

09:49.605 --> 09:51.138
Lane.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.439
Do you go to this church?

09:52.474 --> 09:54.474
Oh, yes.

09:54.526 --> 09:55.726
Yes, I-I do.

09:55.811 --> 09:57.227
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

09:57.313 --> 09:58.593
Well, walk with me
in fellowship.

09:58.614 --> 10:00.014
Right now?
Yeah, into the sanctuary.

10:00.032 --> 10:00.981
Well...

10:01.033 --> 10:02.482
O-Okay, yeah.

10:02.534 --> 10:04.151
Okay, yeah.
God's waiting.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.621
Korean Jesus just gets me, you know
Yes.

10:07.656 --> 10:09.122
in a way that Macedonian Jesus
never got me.

10:09.158 --> 10:11.658
I just wish I spoke more Korean.
Andre...

10:11.744 --> 10:13.627
language is overrated.

10:13.662 --> 10:15.662
Right.
When I was traveling in Saudi Arabia,

10:15.748 --> 10:17.331
I got picked for a jury.
Mm-hmm.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.665
And I participated.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.000
We sentenced the man to death.

10:20.085 --> 10:21.565
And I didn't understand
a single word,

10:21.637 --> 10:22.586
but I knew in my heart

10:22.671 --> 10:24.171
that he had stolen that melon.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.506
Yeah, but what do you do
during the hymns?

10:26.592 --> 10:28.308
Sometimes I just sing
Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors,"

10:28.344 --> 10:29.593
but with nonsense syllables.

10:29.678 --> 10:30.677
That sounds great.

10:30.729 --> 10:32.179
Thanks.
Hey, homie?

10:32.231 --> 10:33.397
Yeah.
Salvation's this way.

10:33.482 --> 10:35.015
Come on.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.350
I'm just afraid that I've become

10:36.435 --> 10:38.318
old and boring
to Jenny, you know?

10:38.354 --> 10:39.736
I have to find a way
to spice things up with her.

10:39.822 --> 10:41.021
Say no more.

10:41.106 --> 10:43.023
I hear you loud and clear.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.491
Incest threesome.
Let's do this.

10:44.526 --> 10:46.526
No. Dear God, no.

10:46.578 --> 10:47.778
You're gonna have
to hold Jenny's legs up.

10:47.863 --> 10:49.329
They look kind of heavy.
And you and I?

10:49.365 --> 10:51.031
Probably do no more
than kissing.

10:51.083 --> 10:51.865
No. The...
Okay?

10:51.917 --> 10:53.166
Oh, my ears hurt,

10:53.202 --> 10:54.618
but my heart is happy.

10:54.703 --> 10:55.669
How are my MacArthur boys doing?

10:55.704 --> 10:57.003
Fine.

10:57.039 --> 10:58.038
Not fine.

10:58.123 --> 10:59.005
I'm trying to have a threesome

10:59.041 --> 11:00.040
with Kevin and Jenny,

11:00.125 --> 11:01.508
but this guy keeps
cockblocking me.

11:01.543 --> 11:02.876
Bro!

11:02.961 --> 11:05.762
You're not gonna let
your own bro bro-bone you, bro?

11:05.848 --> 11:07.714
No! No, I'm not!

11:07.800 --> 11:08.682
You didn't want
to have a threesome

11:08.717 --> 11:09.883
with me and Crazy Tiffany,

11:09.968 --> 11:10.767
you don't want
to have a threesome

11:10.853 --> 11:11.768
with me and your wife.

11:11.854 --> 11:13.553
I'm starting to think it's me.

11:13.605 --> 11:15.389
It <i> is</i> you, dummy.
It is you.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.141
I just want to spice things up
between me and my wife.

11:18.227 --> 11:19.309
Ooh, boy.

11:19.395 --> 11:20.360
I'm not a miracle worker.
Mm.

11:20.396 --> 11:21.728
Oh! Speaking of which,

11:21.780 --> 11:24.564
we have some unfinished
business, Mr. Ruspin.

11:24.616 --> 11:25.565
(laughs)

11:25.617 --> 11:26.650
TACO:
Do you have a moment

11:26.735 --> 11:27.901
to fill out a short survey

11:27.953 --> 11:30.620
about your recent transaction
with EBDB Prime?

11:30.706 --> 11:31.738
No.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.240
Okay. "No."

11:33.325 --> 11:34.324
Thank you.
That was the only question.

11:34.410 --> 11:35.158
What?

11:35.244 --> 11:36.960
Mr. Ruxin. Mr. MacArthur.

11:37.045 --> 11:38.412
Judge Hardy would like
to see you in his chambers.

11:38.497 --> 11:39.246
Judge Hardy?

11:39.331 --> 11:40.247
Immediately. Let's go.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.092
Uh, excuse me, sir.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.082
Do you have a moment

11:42.134 --> 11:43.083
to fill out a short survey

11:43.168 --> 11:44.134
about EBDB Prime?

11:44.219 --> 11:45.252
No.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.136
Let's go.
Perfect.

11:46.221 --> 11:47.471
"No."

11:47.556 --> 11:48.755
Thank you very much!

11:48.807 --> 11:51.091
(singing boisterously in Korean)

11:51.143 --> 11:52.976
(Andre singing nonsense)

11:55.097 --> 11:55.929
I praise you!

12:00.652 --> 12:02.235
Counselors,

12:02.271 --> 12:05.272
I just heard
some disturbing news.

12:05.324 --> 12:08.191
My bailiff overheard
a conversation between you two.

12:08.277 --> 12:09.943
Sounded like collusion.

12:10.028 --> 12:10.861
What?
What?

12:10.946 --> 12:12.412
Something about "Mr. Rivers"

12:12.448 --> 12:13.613
and "coin" was mentioned.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.248
Are you trying to fix this case?

12:15.284 --> 12:17.117
Oh, no...
No, sir. No.

12:17.202 --> 12:18.535
KEVIN:
We're not talking

12:18.620 --> 12:20.454
about Mr. Tom Rivers,
the filthy slumlord...

12:20.539 --> 12:22.289
<i>Alleged</i> filthy slumlord.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.374
KEVIN: We were talking about
Philip Rivers, the quarterback...

12:24.460 --> 12:26.259
Who looks like
a 1950s soda jerk.

12:26.295 --> 12:28.845
Um, I'm going to drop him
onto the waiver wire

12:28.931 --> 12:30.514
so that Ruxin can pick him up

12:30.599 --> 12:32.132
and beat a team called the Coin.

12:32.217 --> 12:33.633
That's all.
Oh, my, my, my, my.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.769
Just fantasy football.
Sure.

12:35.804 --> 12:37.354
That's funny,
'cause I play fantasy football.

12:37.439 --> 12:38.438
Really?
That's right.

12:38.474 --> 12:40.557
My team is Roe
v. Wade Phillips.

12:40.642 --> 12:41.725
That's a clever name.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.693
Thank you.

12:43.779 --> 12:45.061
I'm in a league
with Justice Alito's

12:45.147 --> 12:47.113
Antonio Brown
v. the Board of Education.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.449
Ha! Wordplay.

12:49.485 --> 12:51.234
Tied for first, by the way.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.236
We would never dream

12:53.322 --> 12:54.704
of colluding.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.824
Well, that's 'cause
you're in first place.

12:57.876 --> 13:00.710
You know, if you cheat
in fantasy football,

13:00.796 --> 13:03.046
how long before you cheat
in my courtroom?

13:03.131 --> 13:04.381
It'll be...
be a while.

13:04.466 --> 13:05.715
At least, like, five years.

13:05.801 --> 13:07.167
Colluding is cheating.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.469
You will not cheat
in my courtroom

13:09.505 --> 13:11.004
and you will not cheat
in fantasy football.

13:11.089 --> 13:11.972
Do we understand each other?

13:12.007 --> 13:13.056
Absolutely, sir.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.841
Never again--
in the courtroom or out.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.676
Thank you.
Do we understand each other?

13:16.728 --> 13:17.894
Your Honor, I promise

13:17.980 --> 13:19.846
I will never collude
in your courtroom.

13:19.898 --> 13:20.847
And fantasy football.

13:20.933 --> 13:21.932
Mm-hmm.

13:22.017 --> 13:22.983
No, no.

13:23.018 --> 13:24.901
"Mm-hmm" is not gonna cut it.

13:24.987 --> 13:27.854
Sir, I will never collude
in your courtroom...

13:27.940 --> 13:29.739
HARDY:
And...

13:29.825 --> 13:31.191
in...

13:31.243 --> 13:33.026
(mouthing)

13:33.111 --> 13:34.578
(very quietly):
...fantasy football.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.696
HARDY: You will not collude
in fantasy football

13:36.782 --> 13:38.365
or in my courtroom.
Say it.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.450
Sir, I promise you
that I will never,

13:40.536 --> 13:43.203
in your courtroom
or in fantasy football, collug.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.704
It's-it's "collude."

13:44.756 --> 13:45.705
Colluge.

13:45.757 --> 13:46.540
<i>Collude.</i>

13:46.592 --> 13:47.374
Exactly.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.377
Say it, Counselor.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.178
I will not collude
in your courtroom

13:52.214 --> 13:54.047
or in fantasy.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.799
That wasn't so hard, was it?

13:55.884 --> 13:57.434
See yourselves out, gentlemen.

13:57.519 --> 13:59.269
Good day, Your Honor.

14:01.189 --> 14:03.390
Couldn't you say "collude"?

14:03.442 --> 14:06.059
Oh, you couldn't just say
that your team name sucks?

14:06.111 --> 14:07.727
Roe v. Wade Phillips?
Sucks.

14:07.779 --> 14:09.145
I mean, it's lame.
It really is.

14:09.231 --> 14:10.230
He's not even a player.
I know.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.481
All right, I'm hungry,
I got to eat.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.283
Okay, uh, so you'll
just drop Rivers?

14:13.368 --> 14:14.234
No.

14:14.319 --> 14:15.702
No, what, are you crazy?

14:15.737 --> 14:17.737
I prematurely
dropped the Cincy D,

14:17.789 --> 14:19.823
and now I'm not gonna
get a quarterback?

14:19.908 --> 14:21.741
That means I've got nothing.
That's your problem, not mine.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.793
So what am I supposed
to do about quarterback?

14:23.879 --> 14:25.295
I don't know, pick up Andy
Dalton off the waiver wire.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.420
You know that I'm a
card-carrying member of the ADL.

14:27.466 --> 14:28.582
What is the ADL?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.216
The Andy Defamation League,

14:30.252 --> 14:31.551
where I get together
with a group of people

14:31.587 --> 14:32.867
and talk shit about Andy Dalton.

14:32.888 --> 14:34.421
Why would you talk shit
about Andy Dalton?

14:34.473 --> 14:36.756
Well, for starters,
he's a ging'.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.341
No Rivers.

14:39.561 --> 14:41.628
(growls)

14:45.293 --> 14:46.843
LANE: Andre.
ANDRE: Yeah.

14:46.878 --> 14:49.128
We missed you at the bibimbap-luck.
The what then?

14:49.214 --> 14:51.097
I signed you up to
bring the bulgogi.

14:51.182 --> 14:54.801
I was busy, I'm sorry, I-I'll do
the next bi-bum-bop-bop-bum-bim.

14:54.886 --> 14:56.386
Listen, Andre, I think maybe

14:56.471 --> 14:58.971
you're just using this
church for the free parking.

14:59.057 --> 15:00.390
And you don't even care
about the community.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.058
How dare you, okay?

15:02.143 --> 15:03.893
This church is my home,
all right?

15:03.945 --> 15:06.813
I don't just use it
for free parking.

15:06.898 --> 15:08.197
Andre!
Oh, hey!

15:08.233 --> 15:10.032
Chips and dip, buddy, we got it.

15:10.068 --> 15:11.068
You-you can't park there!

15:11.119 --> 15:12.368
You park here all the time.

15:12.404 --> 15:14.070
We have as much of a right
to park here as you do.

15:14.155 --> 15:15.788
Shit.
Andre,

15:15.874 --> 15:17.573
uh, do you... do you
know those people?

15:17.659 --> 15:18.574
No, I'm sorry,
I-I was just telling them

15:18.626 --> 15:19.575
they can't park there.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.043
That's Kevin and Jenny.

15:21.079 --> 15:22.128
You've known them
since high school.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.296
They don't care for you.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.465
Yeah, tho... uh,
those people, yes.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.749
Those people I know.

15:26.801 --> 15:27.800
Well, they-they shouldn't
be parking in the lot

15:27.886 --> 15:28.751
I know.
if they're not members.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.087
Pastor, they-they, um...

15:31.139 --> 15:32.054
are part of my charity group.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.339
We build houses.

15:33.425 --> 15:35.174
Kind of like Habitat for Humanity,
Oh.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.093
but, uh... we
do it better.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.346
- You know, I... I think it's okay
for them to park here today. - Yeah, yeah.

15:40.432 --> 15:41.764
Yeah, oh, thank you so much.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.983
If you do construction,
there's, uh, a big leak

15:44.068 --> 15:46.235
at the top of the church roof.

15:46.271 --> 15:48.311
Maybe you could patch it up.
PASTOR: Oh, great idea.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.239
How about tomorrow
night, uh, Monday night?

15:50.275 --> 15:52.108
Monday, yeah, well,
I, you know, I...

15:52.193 --> 15:53.443
I normally have a standing...

15:53.528 --> 15:54.911
Okay, Monday night it is.

15:54.946 --> 15:55.945
After evening services.

15:55.997 --> 15:56.829
After...
This is beautiful.

15:56.915 --> 15:57.997
But maybe you can help.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.415
(chuckles)
I wish.

15:59.451 --> 16:02.368
Uh, tomorrow night,
I'm shaving ironic mustaches

16:02.454 --> 16:04.954
to donate to children
who've lost their eyebrows.

16:05.039 --> 16:07.173
Of course.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.459
ANDRE:
<i>I know nothing about carpentry.</i>

16:09.544 --> 16:12.011
This Korean Jesus is screwing me
every chance he gets.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.429
Well, speaking
of getting screwed,

16:13.465 --> 16:15.298
Ruxin is gonna lose to the Coin.

16:15.383 --> 16:16.933
Now you just got to beat
him in the courtroom.

16:16.968 --> 16:18.601
I know, I need a big game
at work this week.

16:18.636 --> 16:21.471
You do. I'm gonna take advantage
of our amazing parking spot

16:21.523 --> 16:22.355
and go run some errands.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.473
Okay.

16:23.558 --> 16:24.440
Bye. Bye.
One for me?

16:24.476 --> 16:26.526
(TV playing indistinctly)

16:26.611 --> 16:27.727
Hey, Andre, get your feet
off your couch.

16:27.812 --> 16:28.694
It's a foot couch.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.196
That's the butt couch.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.864
Hey, Kevin.
Hey, what's up?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.366
And Andre.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.485
I said hi to you,
like, three days ago.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.119
Kevin, I got you something

16:37.155 --> 16:40.406
that's gonna help with your
super-boring sex life.

16:40.492 --> 16:41.657
What, is that a parachute?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.992
It's a sex swing.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.160
What?

16:44.212 --> 16:45.495
It's a little chewed up,

16:45.547 --> 16:47.079
'cause I use it as a
net to go crabbing with.

16:47.165 --> 16:48.798
And I'm not sure what the guy
I bought it from on Craigslist

16:48.833 --> 16:50.583
did with it
before selling it to me.

16:50.668 --> 16:52.335
Oh, so it's
a secondhand sex swing.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.836
It's a sharing economy, brother.

16:53.888 --> 16:54.969
Get that thing out of here.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.138
It's dumb.
ANDRE: Wait, wait.

16:56.174 --> 16:57.423
That's just technically
a harness, right?

16:57.509 --> 16:59.342
Yeah, it could support
up to four people.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.760
I could use that at the church,

17:00.845 --> 17:02.228
I mean, to get up
to the ceiling.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.313
Oh, I've used it in a church
before-- it works great.

17:04.348 --> 17:06.648
If Andre uses it, it definitely
won't be a sex swing then.

17:06.684 --> 17:07.964
No, I'm gonna
dry-clean it first.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.268
TACO: Oh, you don't
have to clean it.

17:09.354 --> 17:11.521
Just a little bit
of sea salt on it.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.439
Oh, no, there's some come.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.193
I lost 'cause of you.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.528
You're gonna pay,
shit-sipper.

17:18.613 --> 17:20.195
Quit bitching, baby Ruxin.

17:20.281 --> 17:22.031
TACO (laughs):
This is personal.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.532
Fellas, save it for the game.

17:25.369 --> 17:27.369
Mr. Rivers.
Mr. Ruxin, thank you.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.421
Gonna win this
one for you today.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.423
Hey, Kevin!

17:30.508 --> 17:32.124
I need a big work game
out of you, buddy!

17:32.210 --> 17:33.876
Ruxin, I'm counting on you, bud.

17:33.962 --> 17:35.878
Don't let me down.

17:35.964 --> 17:37.213
Yeah, but no pressure.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.265
Yeah, no pressure.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.101
All rise.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.970
The Honorable Raymond
Hardy's presiding.

17:44.055 --> 17:44.887
Be seated.

17:48.226 --> 17:49.692
Fire-crotch is
gonna crush you.

17:49.727 --> 17:50.943
No way.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.812
Mr. Tate, big fan.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.780
Wish you'd stayed in Seattle.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.283
But in my courtroom,
we all try to keep quiet.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.485
Sorry, Your Honor,
we've been tailgating.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.571
(gavel bangs)
I call this court to session.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.906
Counselor, first witness.

18:03.992 --> 18:05.575
The State would like to call

18:05.660 --> 18:07.710
Mr. Thomas Rivers
to the stand please.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.339
Mr. Rivers, how many
different lawsuits

18:11.424 --> 18:13.090
are currently pending
against you now?

18:13.176 --> 18:14.392
I object.

18:14.477 --> 18:15.509
Goes to character, Your Honor.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.677
I'll allow it.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.347
Yes, that's a point.
It's early.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.349
Oh, well, if we're
going to character,

18:21.434 --> 18:24.352
my client wouldn't have sex with
his wife while she was sleeping,

18:24.437 --> 18:26.320
unlike the degenerate
opposing counsel.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.356
Uh... Objection,
Your Honor.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.607
I-I'd like that stricken
from the record.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.826
Oh, damn.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.910
Mr. Ruxin, do you have
a point here?

18:32.995 --> 18:34.578
Yeah, my point is
if he's willing

18:34.664 --> 18:36.697
to penetrate his wife
while she sleeps,

18:36.749 --> 18:40.951
what's to say that he would not
sodomize Lady Justice herself?

18:41.037 --> 18:43.704
Your Honor, number one,
my wife was not sleeping.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.122
She just couldn't be bothered

18:45.208 --> 18:46.888
to move around or open
her eyes during sex.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.626
That's all.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.845
And what does that say about him
as a lawyer and as a lover?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.513
It says I'm courteous.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.848
And I would like that
<i>in</i> the record please.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.300
I don't want to win like this,
but I'll take it.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.026
Your Honor, how could
you possibly believe

18:58.054 --> 18:59.637
anything the defense
counselor is saying

18:59.722 --> 19:01.806
when he lied to you
in your chambers,

19:01.891 --> 19:03.274
saying he wouldn't collude
in fantasy football

19:03.359 --> 19:04.859
and then turned around
and did exactly that.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.610
Inadmissible, that's hearsay.

19:06.696 --> 19:09.063
No, no, not if you call him
to the stand, Kevin.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.197
Oh, is it?
Yeah, dude.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.615
Yeah, all right, bro.

19:11.701 --> 19:13.117
Come on, shark-Ruxin,
we need at TD.

19:13.202 --> 19:15.202
And that's enough
out of you two.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.987
Your Honor, I would like to add
one more thing to the record.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.656
Counselor here lied to you

19:18.741 --> 19:19.740
and told you that he
liked your team name,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.325
when in fact he insulted it.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.663
Did you insult my team name?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.415
Yes or no?
Come on, Counselor.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.749
Well?

19:28.835 --> 19:32.002
Roe v. Wade Phillips
is a stupid name.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.055
I mean, you got a hundred
years of football.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.924
Reggie Bush v. Frank Gore.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.642
Dred Bart Scott.

19:38.728 --> 19:40.227
I mean, these are just
off the top of my head.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.229
Objection, Your Honor, they're
not off the top of his head.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.398
He has a list on his phone
called "Team-names-comma-puns."

19:44.434 --> 19:45.816
Oh, please.

19:45.902 --> 19:47.268
You think I can't just
come up with those?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.569
All right, fine,
I want to see your phone.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.237
Oh, you want to see my phone?
Yeah, come on, dude.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.439
Give me your phone. Dude, give me your phone
Come at me, bro.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.107
Come at me, bro.
State's exhibit A, bro.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.275
State's exhibit A, bro.
(gavel slams)

19:54.327 --> 19:55.276
Fine, you know what?

19:55.328 --> 19:56.444
I'll smack your exhibit D

19:56.496 --> 19:57.411
right into your exhibit Bs.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.579
(gavel slams)

19:58.614 --> 19:59.947
That's it, ejected,
both of them!

19:59.999 --> 20:00.948
What? Ejected? Ejected?
Get 'em out of here.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.867
Come on, two ejections?
Oh.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.952
It's garbage time here.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.953
We won, Golden!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.037
No, we won, Taco!

20:07.123 --> 20:08.205
Gattaca!
We won!

20:08.291 --> 20:10.125
God, I hate my team.

20:12.848 --> 20:14.515
(Andre sings to himself)

20:14.600 --> 20:17.101
Time to get some Spackle.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.521
(grunts)

20:25.277 --> 20:27.861
It's time for the Sp... Whoa.

20:27.913 --> 20:29.697
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:29.782 --> 20:30.914
(shouts)

20:31.867 --> 20:33.200
(thuds, grunts)

20:33.285 --> 20:34.835
(speaking Korean, laughing)

20:37.957 --> 20:40.174
(shouts in Korean)

20:41.677 --> 20:42.926
Don't look!

20:43.012 --> 20:44.595
Close your eyes!
Pastor Kim, close your eyes!

20:44.680 --> 20:46.046
ANDRE:
Oh, hey.

20:46.098 --> 20:47.047
Little help.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.632
You are against God.

20:48.718 --> 20:51.134
You are excommunicated
from this congregation.

20:51.254 --> 20:52.224
What about my parking?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.133
(shouts in Korean)

20:53.424 --> 20:53.924
What?

20:55.129 --> 20:57.123
Is that a yes or no?
I don't understand.

20:57.243 --> 20:57.970
Andre?

20:58.677 --> 21:00.424
What are you doing with my old sex swing?

21:00.806 --> 21:01.642
Ugh.

21:01.762 --> 21:12.159
