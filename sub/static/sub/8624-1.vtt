01:21.640 --> 01:23.961
<i>Hello, darling. It's your mother.</i>

01:24.480 --> 01:27.962
<i>Thank you for showing me
your new apartment.</i>

01:29.920 --> 01:32.161
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

01:33.160 --> 01:35.481
<i>I mean, how can you live like that?</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:39.691
<i>Anyway, would you call me back?
Let's get together again.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:41.886
<i>I love you.</i>

05:15.000 --> 05:16.286
<i>Control.</i>

05:17.440 --> 05:18.885
<i>It's all about control.</i>

05:21.160 --> 05:23.401
<i>Every dictatorship has one obsession.</i>

05:23.960 --> 05:24.961
And that's it.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.564
So, in ancient Rome,

05:28.040 --> 05:30.361
they gave the people bread and circuses.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.284
They kept the populace busy
with entertainment.

05:36.680 --> 05:41.129
But other dictatorships use
other strategies to control ideas.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.045
The knowledge.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.009
How do they do that?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.850
Lower education.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.489
They limit culture.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.605
Censor information.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.321
They censor any means
of individual expression.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.124
And it's important to remember this,
that this is a pattern

06:02.880 --> 06:05.611
that repeats itself throughout history.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.406
Okay.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.923
See you next week.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.841
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.046
How are you?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.201
I'm good.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.044
<i>See, every dictatorship,</i>

08:15.560 --> 08:17.847
there's only one obsession
and that's control,

08:17.920 --> 08:19.843
they wanna have control over the people.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.722
In ancient Rome,
they gave bread and circuses,

08:26.560 --> 08:28.608
<i>they kept the populace
busy with entertainment.</i>

08:31.720 --> 08:34.087
<i>In other dictatorships,
they have other strategies.</i>

08:36.640 --> 08:39.610
<i>To limit information,
to limit ideas and knowledge.</i>

08:42.120 --> 08:43.280
<i>How do they do that?</i>

08:43.880 --> 08:46.770
<i>They lower education, limit culture.</i>

08:48.720 --> 08:51.963
<i>They censor any means of self-expression.</i>

08:53.960 --> 08:56.804
<i>But it's important to remember this,
this is a pattern</i>

08:57.280 --> 08:58.361
<i>that repeats itself</i>

08:59.480 --> 09:01.130
<i>throughout history.</i>

09:25.640 --> 09:28.120
You don't go to the movies, do you?

09:29.440 --> 09:30.441
Movies?

09:31.480 --> 09:33.323
Yeah, are you a movie guy?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.010
In your free time, I mean?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.402
I don't know,

09:41.840 --> 09:45.083
I don't go out that much,
I don't really like movies.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.564
You don't have to go out
to enjoy a good flick at home.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.926
That's true.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.242
I usually just rent them.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.761
Most people don't these days,

09:59.840 --> 10:02.081
but it's What I do.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.927
Is there a reason why
you're asking me this?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.161
No.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.603
'Cause you brought it up and
I thought, you know, maybe

10:08.680 --> 10:11.047
you had a recommendation,
or you saw a movie that you liked

10:11.120 --> 10:12.690
and you wanna tell me about it.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.367
Sure, I mean, there's always something.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.366
I could go for something cheerful.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.880
Where There's a <i>Will</i> There's a Way.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.166
It's true.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.688
No, it's a movie, I saw
it a little while ago,

10:41.160 --> 10:44.687
but I remember, I liked it.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.005
Where There's a <i>Will</i> There's a Way.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.161
Yeah, that's it.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.885
Local film, if you...

10:51.080 --> 10:52.764
I'll keep it in mind.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.490
I think I'm drunk.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.729
You wanna go to bed?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.444
You wanna go to bed?

12:47.360 --> 12:52.207
No, I'm gonna finish grading these papers
and then I'll come join you, okay?

13:41.680 --> 13:44.251
<i>Mr. Henderson, my husband will be back.</i>

13:44.320 --> 13:46.926
<i>Your husband just won
a heck lot of money from me.</i>

13:47.120 --> 13:49.321
<i>By the look in his eye
he didn't have an intention to...</i>

14:56.240 --> 14:57.605
Stop!

14:58.440 --> 14:59.441
Stop!

14:59.840 --> 15:01.729
Okay, okay, Okay-

15:07.120 --> 15:08.610
What's wrong?

15:28.120 --> 15:29.770
I'll call you tomorrow.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.450
Sorry I'm late.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.601
All right.

18:04.840 --> 18:09.164
Last class we talked about dictatorship,
so today we'll start with Hegel.

18:11.920 --> 18:17.131
It was Hegel who said that all
the greatest world events happen twice.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.601
And then, Karl Marx added,
the first time it was a tragedy,

18:21.680 --> 18:23.728
and the second time it was a farce.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.206
<i>It's strange to think...</i>

18:29.920 --> 18:31.570
<i>A lot of the world's thinkers are worried</i>

18:31.640 --> 18:35.486
<i>that this century will be
a repetition of the last one.</i>

18:37.520 --> 18:41.684
<i>And there's an interesting observation,
a creative act of memory</i>

18:41.760 --> 18:44.206
<i>to remember something,
to remember somebody...</i>

20:43.000 --> 20:46.163
<i>I'm looking for Call me L8R or
Passenger Without</i> a <i>Ticket.</i>

24:05.560 --> 24:06.561
Shit.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.441
Anthony?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.045
Anthony!

24:30.440 --> 24:32.568
Hey, long time no see!

24:32.760 --> 24:35.650
I couldn't tell it was you with that beard.
Is that for a movie?

24:35.720 --> 24:36.721
Yeah.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.051
Man, you haven't been around here
for ages.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.050
Yeah, I don't know how long it's been.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.645
Six months, I'd say.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.082
Six months or more.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.648
Yeah, so how's everything?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.121
Great.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.605
Are you meeting someone here?
'Cause there's no one around.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.561
- No?
- No,

24:55.680 --> 24:57.160
you know no one
comes in on Saturdays.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.729
I was supposed to pick up the thing...

25:06.200 --> 25:07.690
For the movie.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.847
And I forgot it was Saturday...
'Cause my head is, like...

25:11.760 --> 25:16.049
You actors are something else. Hold on,
let me see if there's anything for you.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.161
Great.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.524
Yeah, here it is, look.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.042
That looks like it's it. That's
definitely it. That's definitely it.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.043
- There you go. All right?
- Okay.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.043
- Hey, don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.646
- Good luck with that movie.
- Great, I will... Yes.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.089
Anthony Claire.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.888
3650 Rathburn Road.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.681
<i>Hello?</i>

29:10.160 --> 29:12.527
- Good afternoon, I'm calling...
- Hey.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.326
- I'm calling to speak to...
- Where are you <i>calling</i> from?

29:16.440 --> 29:18.602
I'm sorry, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.364
I'm calling to speak to
Daniel Saint Claire, the...

29:20.440 --> 29:21.726
<i>Anthony?</i>

29:22.920 --> 29:24.684
<i>Anthony, you called home.</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:27.002
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.003
<i>What are you doing?</i>

29:29.240 --> 29:31.447
<i>- My name's not Anthony.
- You're not Anthony?</i>

29:31.560 --> 29:35.531
No, I'm calling to speak to
Daniel Saint Claire, the actor.

29:37.040 --> 29:42.604
If I'm not mistaken, that's Anthony
Claire's name that he uses for the movies.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.529
For his work.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.721
<i>Right.</i>

29:49.000 --> 29:53.050
<i>Right, well, Daniel isn't here right now,
maybe I could get him to call you back.</i>

29:54.720 --> 29:56.370
Okay, I'm sorry to bother you.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.445
<i>What?</i>

30:01.520 --> 30:02.521
What?

30:09.160 --> 30:10.730
L... L.-

30:12.240 --> 30:13.730
<i>Who is this?</i>

30:18.200 --> 30:19.929
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

30:20.000 --> 30:21.650
He doesn't know me.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.006
No.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.811
- Okay. I'm gonna... I'll call back later.
- Anthony?

31:32.520 --> 31:33.681
<i>Hello?</i>

31:33.760 --> 31:35.683
Hello, this is Anthony...

31:36.320 --> 31:38.482
This is Anthony Claire, isn't it?

31:38.560 --> 31:40.130
<i>Who's calling?</i>

31:43.560 --> 31:47.531
I called before. I was talking...
I talked to your wife. Crazy.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.250
<i>You're the one.</i>

31:49.320 --> 31:50.924
<i>And you call here again,
I will call the police...</i>

31:51.000 --> 31:54.004
I... No, no. Just hear me out.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.889
Can you say something again?
Can you talk again?

31:58.320 --> 31:59.560
<i>Who is this?</i>

31:59.640 --> 32:02.962
That's crazy. That's amazing.

32:03.040 --> 32:06.203
Our... Your voice is just like mine.
Do you hear my voice?

32:06.320 --> 32:08.368
Your voice is just like mine.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.691
Shit.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.520
- Listen...
- Sorry, please, please, please.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.807
Just listen to me for a second.
Just listen, okay? Just hear me out.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.803
I know this sounds crazy.
I'm sorry. I got excited before.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.450
When I get excited, I just
act a little strange.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.124
So just hear me out for a second.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.567
I've seen three of your movies.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.610
And you're great in them.
You're great in them.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.250
We look exactly alike.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.527
And I called your wife earlier today.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.650
And she said that...
She thought that I was you.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.769
And I'm just... I'm confused.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.561
And I know this call must be just
as confusing for you as it is for me.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.723
And I just... My name is Adam Bell.
I'm a history teacher.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.643
And I just think that we should meet.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.809
Hey, hey, hey, okay. Okay.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.884
Listen to me. Never call here again.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.726
Who was that?

33:20.800 --> 33:22.643
It was that same guy.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.841
What did he want?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.046
I don't know. He sounded crazy.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.691
Like, he sounded
like a stalker or something.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.047
- A stalker?
- Yeah, he said that he was a fan of mine.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.885
That he wanted to meet up or something.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.605
What?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.605
- No.
- Yeah.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.569
You're messing with me.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.211
Right?

33:55.880 --> 33:57.803
Anthony?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.930
Do you want to get something to eat?

34:02.920 --> 34:04.809
Who was on the phone?

34:07.040 --> 34:09.884
Helen, the same guy who called before.
The same guy.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.042
That's who was on the phone.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.882
I told you that.
Why would I tell you any differently?

34:17.360 --> 34:18.565
Are you lying to me?

34:20.040 --> 34:21.451
L.-

34:25.480 --> 34:27.244
You're lying to me.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.129
You're acting crazy.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.922
I'm not crazy. Who was on the phone?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.685
I told you it was a man
who was on the phone.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.764
Are you seeing her?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.083
Helen, I don't want to get into this.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.083
Are you seeing her again?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.280
We need to get something to eat.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.402
Let's go get something to eat and then...

34:53.480 --> 34:54.641
I don't want to get anything...

34:54.719 --> 34:57.166
it was a man! It was a man.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.524
What do you think it was,
a jealous husband?

35:00.600 --> 35:01.761
Yeah.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.051
I don't want to get into this again. Okay?

35:06.120 --> 35:07.326
I don't want to get into this.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.363
I'm going for a walk.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.768
- Yes.
- Yeah, <i>it's</i> me, man.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.844
That's so strange.
I had a feeling that you were gonna call.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.968
<i>You had a feeling, what's that mean?</i>

38:36.080 --> 38:39.926
It's a, you know, just a figure of speech.
It's not...

38:40.000 --> 38:41.650
<i>Right. All right.
Well, look, I've been thinking about it.</i>

38:41.720 --> 38:43.165
<i>I wanna meet.</i>

38:46.560 --> 38:49.166
- Okay.
<i>- I know</i> a <i>place called the Breezeway Inn.</i>

38:49.240 --> 38:52.244
<i>It's about an hour outside the city.
Do you know where that is?</i>

38:53.320 --> 38:54.685
No.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.491
<i>All right. Well, then I'll call you
on Sunday with directions.</i>

38:57.560 --> 39:00.404
- 1.-00, okay?
- Okay.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.970
<i>All right.</i>

39:04.160 --> 39:06.527
- Well, see you soon.
- Yeah.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.562
<i>Yeah, I'll see you soon.</i>

40:27.960 --> 40:29.041
Hello.

40:33.440 --> 40:34.487
Hi.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.681
Is everything all right?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.011
How many months are you?

41:01.440 --> 41:02.851
Six.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.890
That's nice.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.810
I should be going.
I have a class, I have to teach in it.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.726
Never know how your day is gonna turn out.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.450
Have a nice day.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.324
<i>What's up, honey?</i>

42:06.640 --> 42:07.926
<i>Hello?</i>

42:09.160 --> 42:10.446
<i>Hello?</i>

42:33.600 --> 42:35.090
Hi.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.208
It is a scorcher out there.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.244
The last 10 minutes of my run,

42:45.320 --> 42:48.847
this 22-year-old kid or
something like that, he was...

42:48.960 --> 42:51.327
He was following me the whole time.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.849
Never gonna beat this kid.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.085
And he dropped.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.165
Do you think that I should cut my beard off
'cause it's fucking hot?

43:01.840 --> 43:05.287
Wait, why did you call me earlier?
Did you call me for a reason?

43:06.800 --> 43:09.963
Honey, where are the blueberries?

43:12.800 --> 43:14.484
Where are the blueberries?

43:14.560 --> 43:16.847
I told you, like, two days ago.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.446
The organic blueberries.
Not the conventional blueberries.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.363
I can't use 'em in the shake.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.850
What's wrong?

43:23.920 --> 43:26.605
<i>I wasn't... Only I was saying 'cause I
read it in a magazine that blueberries,</i>

43:26.680 --> 43:28.760
<i>the organic ones are better
than conventional ones...</i>

43:41.400 --> 43:43.880
Are you gonna tell me what's wrong?

43:49.360 --> 43:50.646
L.-

43:54.800 --> 43:56.404
I went to...

44:00.600 --> 44:02.568
I went to see that guy.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.327
Who? What're you talking about?

44:09.720 --> 44:10.960
The guy on the phone.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.088
I went to his work.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.243
Why did you do that?
That's dangerous, honey.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.049
I wanted to know.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.450
Are you okay?

44:35.080 --> 44:37.367
He had the same voice.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.281
He looks exactly like you.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.766
What do you mean, "Exactly like me"?

44:51.400 --> 44:53.243
What's happening?

45:03.960 --> 45:07.089
I don't... Really don't know
what you're talking about.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.330
I think you know.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.730
I think you know.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.526
Hello?

49:35.280 --> 49:36.725
I told you.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.321
- Show me your hands, man.
- Why?

51:17.280 --> 51:19.123
Come on, show me your hands.

51:41.720 --> 51:44.007
Maybe we're brothers.

51:46.680 --> 51:50.048
We're not... We're not brothers.
We're not brothers.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.170
How do you know?

51:54.440 --> 51:56.090
Do you have a...

51:57.240 --> 51:59.846
Do you have a scar on your chest?

52:09.000 --> 52:10.490
This one?

52:21.920 --> 52:23.649
You do, don't you?

52:28.960 --> 52:30.325
L.-

52:30.400 --> 52:33.324
- When's your birthday?
- This was a bad idea.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.007
I think I made a mistake here.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.484
I have a...

52:40.560 --> 52:41.800
I have this. I went to...

52:41.880 --> 52:45.521
The company that represents you,
they gave that to me... To you.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.563
I'm sorry.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.405
I'm sorry.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.364
Don't worry, honey.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.809
That guy won't be calling here again.

54:36.520 --> 54:37.806
Fuck.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.650
There must be some difference.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.807
There isn't.

59:40.680 --> 59:43.001
It cannot be exactly the same.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.565
We are.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.641
Did you take your clothes off
in front of him?

59:49.720 --> 59:50.767
No.

59:52.600 --> 59:54.443
Okay, then.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.090
You didn't eat.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.525
The last thing you need is to be meeting
strange men in hotel rooms.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.850
You have enough trouble
sticking with one woman, don't you?

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.326
Here.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.921
I don't like blueberries.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.847
Of course you do, and they're good for you.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.731
I am going to pretend I never heard a word
of what you just told me.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.930
I just wanted your advice.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.482
You don't want advice.
I don't wanna hear any more about this.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.685
You are my only son.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.961
I am your only mother.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.408
You have a respectable job,
you have a nice apartment,

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.245
and since we're being frank here,

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.400
I think you should quit that fantasy
of being a third-rate movie actor.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.807
Eat those. You want some coffee?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.770
<i>I have a question for you.</i>

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.371
Did you fuck my wife?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.605
Did you fuck my wife?
Did you sleep with my wife?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.645
You fucked my wife!

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.485
Did you fuck my wife?

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.446
That's good. That is fuckin' good.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.763
This is what's gonna happen.
You're giving me your clothes and your car.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.004
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.363
<i>Tomorrow, I bring her home.</i>

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.690
<i>And I'm gonna come back here,</i>

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.606
<i>bring back all your things, and I'm gonna
disappear from your life forever.</i>

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.769
<i>And then I'll be gone.</i>

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.847
What are you doing here?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.645
What the fuck is this place, man?
You live here?

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.726
I have some questions for you.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.010
Please go or I'll call the police.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.160
Go ahead, call the police.
What are you gonna tell 'em?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.364
What are you gonna tell 'em, man?

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.409
Why'd you come looking for me?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.367
I don't know. I don't know. I just...

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.161
I needed to know.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.361
You need to know. Yeah. Okay.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.809
But when you called my house,
you talked to my wife.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.565
Why'd you do that?

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.362
She happened to pick up the phone.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.805
Okay. Yeah, but...

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.240
Can I ask you something, just man to man?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.564
Did you sleep with my wife?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.327
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.765
Did you fuck my wife?

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.087
This is crazy.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.329
Just answer the question, man.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.520
Just answer my fuckin' question
and then I will leave.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.561
You're fuckin' crazy.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.485
All right.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.086
I'm fuckin' crazy? I'm fuckin' crazy?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.643
I'm fuckin' crazy?

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.929
I'm fuckin' crazy?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.443
You brought my wife into this, man.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.205
So I'm gonna bring your girlfriend
into the picture as well.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.840
You want me out of your life?
This is what's gonna happen first.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.450
You're gonna give me
your clothes and your car.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.329
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.687
I'm gonna bring her back home tomorrow,
and I'm gonna come back here,

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.807
and I'm gonna bring back all your stuff

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.929
and I'm going to disappear
from your life forever.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.045
Then we will be even.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.569
Mr. Claire. Good afternoon.
Everything good?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.802
Yeah, I just...

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.161
Forgot my keys.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.570
Is Mrs. Claire not home?

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.489
Do you want me to open the door for you?

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.249
That'd be perfect. Yeah.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.359
I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.169
Can't get out of my head.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.120
I know I shouldn't talk about this,

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.090
but I'd love to go back.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.606
I heard they changed the lock
and sent out new keys.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.768
But I don't think I'm on the list.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.845
I need to go back.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.162
I'll see what I can do. I don't...

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.720
I don't know if that's
going to be possible.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.564
Call me if you hear anything.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.765
After you.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.246
- Okay. Here you go, Mr. Claire.
- Thank you.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.926
Hello?

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.003
- Anthony?
- Hi.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.764
The light's on, you freaked me out.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.321
Sorry.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.361
What're you doing home?
I thought you were at your mom's.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.085
I canceled it, I...

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.480
Should've called.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.562
I stayed longer at the pool,

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.082
'cause I thought you weren't
gonna be home.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.285
Do you need anything?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.721
I'm fine.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.811
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.681
Okay.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.966
Are you sure you don't need anything?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.881
'Cause you...

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.527
When you came in
and you said that you went to the pool,

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.922
I just thought maybe
that you've been there for a long time,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.527
and you had to walk home
or whatever and you must be...

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.886
ls everything okay?

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.486
You're six months pregnant,
so I didn't know.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.160
No, I'm fine.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.483
Why don't you come to bed?

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.881
L.-

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.968
Aren't you gonna take your clothes off?

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.566
Yeah.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.210
Did you have a good day at school?

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.526
What?

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.965
Forget it.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.366
What? What? What?

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.125
Mary. Mary. MEW-

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.641
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.650
The ring. The mark on your finger.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.966
What are you talking about?

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.761
I've always had this.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.488
No. No!

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.802
Who are you?
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.928
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.088
- Don't touch me!
- What are you talking about?

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.522
The ring. The mark on your finger.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.686
What's wrong?

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.761
What's wrong?

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.211
I just couldn't sleep.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.448
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.050
I'm sorry.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.331
Why are you doing this to me?

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.170
What? What am I doing to you?

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.489
I want you to stay.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.126
- Stop the car.
- Stop the car? Stop the car?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.169
<i>- Stop the fucking car.
- I'll stop the fucking car.</i>

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.486
<i>You want me to stop the car?</i>

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.240
Get out. I'm sick of this shit.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:28.960
<i>I can't even talk to you.</i>

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.327
- Fuck you.
- You're behaving like a child.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.765
<i>You're not a man.</i>

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.808
- I'm not a man?
- Enough. You don't need to get me started.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.041
<i>I'm not a man?</i>

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.087
I'm not a fucking man? Get out! Get out!

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.400
- Get out! Get the fuck out!
- Let go!

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.122
<i>Sunshine, a high of 24 today,
clear tonight with a low of 13.</i>

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.250
<i>Here's James with a look at traffic.</i>

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.364
<i>The westbound Lake Shore is closed
between Bathurst and Strone,</i>

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.523
<i>as crews clean up debris from a collision
that happened early this morning.</i>

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.769
<i>Police have not released
any details at this time,</i>

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.842
<i>but we do know there was only one vehicle.</i>

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.121
I forgot to tell you
that your mother called.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.244
You should probably call her back.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.841
Okay.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.880
