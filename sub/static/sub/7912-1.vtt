01:13.456 --> 01:15.958
My name's Marlowe.
The general wanted to see me.

01:15.959 --> 01:19.517
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

01:21.731 --> 01:25.447
- I'll tell the general that you're here.
- Thank you.

01:38.381 --> 01:39.832
Morning.

01:45.155 --> 01:46.986
You're not very tall, are you?

01:48.291 --> 01:49.978
Well, I tried to be.

01:52.428 --> 01:54.455
Not bad-looking...

01:54.864 --> 01:56.698
...though you probably know it.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.111
Thank you.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.790
- What's your name?
- Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

02:02.772 --> 02:05.340
That's a funny kind of name.

02:05.341 --> 02:06.675
You think so?

02:07.877 --> 02:10.579
What are you? A prizefighter?

02:10.580 --> 02:12.247
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's that?

02:12.248 --> 02:16.734
- A private detective.
- You're making fun of me.

02:24.828 --> 02:26.777
You're cute.

02:29.666 --> 02:32.610
The general will see you now, sir.

02:39.843 --> 02:41.977
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood.

02:41.978 --> 02:44.346
You ought to wean her.
She's old enough.

02:55.358 --> 02:58.227
- This is Mr. Marlowe, general.
- How do you do, sir?

02:58.228 --> 03:00.229
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.022
Brandy, Norris.

03:02.632 --> 03:06.168
- How do you like your brandy, sir?
- In a glass.

03:06.169 --> 03:08.570
I used to like mine with champagne.

03:08.571 --> 03:10.739
Champagne cold as Valley Forge...

03:10.740 --> 03:13.375
...with about three ponies
of brandy under it.

03:13.376 --> 03:15.207
Come, come, man!
Pour a decent one.

03:16.045 --> 03:19.181
I like to see people drink.

03:19.182 --> 03:20.974
That'll do, Norris.

03:21.384 --> 03:23.619
You may take off your coat, sir.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.254
Thank you.

03:25.255 --> 03:28.395
Too hot in here for any man
with any blood in his veins.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.960
You may smoke too.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.224
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

03:35.365 --> 03:40.102
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

03:40.103 --> 03:44.439
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.075
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

03:47.076 --> 03:49.878
Little I can eat, and
my sleep is so near waking...

03:49.879 --> 03:51.546
...it's hardly worth the name.

03:51.547 --> 03:56.336
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

03:56.586 --> 03:59.888
The orchids are an excuse
for the heat.

03:59.889 --> 04:02.424
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

04:02.425 --> 04:03.575
Nasty things.

04:03.927 --> 04:06.261
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

04:06.262 --> 04:09.742
Their perfume has the rotten
sweetness of corruption.

04:13.469 --> 04:15.000
Tell me about yourself.

04:15.571 --> 04:18.440
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.142
I can still speak English
when my business demands it.

04:21.144 --> 04:23.345
I worked for the
district attorney's office.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.290
Inspector Bernie Ohls
said you wanted to see me.

04:26.716 --> 04:29.201
You didn't like working
for the district attorney?

04:30.553 --> 04:34.923
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

04:36.092 --> 04:38.657
I always did, myself.

04:39.228 --> 04:41.138
What do you know about my family?

04:41.397 --> 04:44.066
Well, you're a widower,
a millionaire.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.134
You have two daughters.
One unmarried...

04:46.135 --> 04:49.615
...and one married to a man
named Rutledge, but it didn't take.

04:49.639 --> 04:52.204
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

04:52.442 --> 04:55.503
Both pretty and both pretty wild.

04:56.946 --> 05:00.125
- Why'd you want to see me?
- I'm being blackmailed again.

05:00.249 --> 05:01.383
Again?

05:01.384 --> 05:04.720
About a year ago, I paid a man
named Joe Brody $5000...

05:04.721 --> 05:07.089
...to let my younger daughter alone.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.500
What does that mean?

05:10.126 --> 05:12.389
It means, "Hm!"

05:12.795 --> 05:15.438
It didn't go through the DA
or I'd have heard.

05:15.598 --> 05:18.280
- Who handled it for you?
- Shawn Regan.

05:18.301 --> 05:22.204
There must be some reason why
he isn't handling it this time.

05:22.205 --> 05:24.039
Shawn has left me.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.951
- I thought I hadn't seen him lately.
- A month ago, without a word.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.381
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

05:32.382 --> 05:35.784
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more.

05:35.785 --> 05:38.925
And that at least
he'd have said goodbye.

05:40.690 --> 05:42.032
That's what hurt.

05:43.159 --> 05:44.793
You knew him too?

05:44.794 --> 05:48.030
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico...

05:48.031 --> 05:50.265
...and I was on the other side.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.134
We swapped shots
between drinks...

05:52.135 --> 05:54.241
...or drinks between shots.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.639
My respects to you, sir.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.656
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.980
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.081
But you knew that.

06:06.082 --> 06:08.149
No, I didn't.

06:10.253 --> 06:12.687
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

06:12.688 --> 06:16.992
No one was more pleased than I
when you took him on as your...

06:16.993 --> 06:18.444
...whatever he was.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.295
My friend.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.363
My son, almost.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.635
Many an hour he sat with me,
sweating like a pig...

06:26.636 --> 06:31.373
...drinking brandy and telling
stories of the Irish Revolution.

06:31.374 --> 06:33.175
Well, enough of that.

06:33.176 --> 06:34.549
Here.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.443
Read the other side.

07:04.307 --> 07:06.334
These her signatures?

07:06.709 --> 07:09.211
- Who's Arthur Geiger?
- I haven't any idea.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.546
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

07:11.547 --> 07:14.346
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

07:14.484 --> 07:17.452
I met her in the hall
and she did that to me.

07:17.453 --> 07:20.655
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

07:20.656 --> 07:21.990
Well?

07:24.026 --> 07:27.195
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

07:27.196 --> 07:28.608
They alike?

07:28.798 --> 07:32.601
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

07:32.602 --> 07:35.370
Vivian is spoiled, exacting...

07:35.371 --> 07:37.272
...smart and ruthless.

07:37.273 --> 07:42.140
Carmen is still a little child who
likes to pull the wings off flies.

07:42.678 --> 07:45.447
I assume they have
all the usual vices...

07:45.448 --> 07:48.509
...besides those they've
invented for themselves.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.520
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe...

07:51.521 --> 07:54.222
...it's because my hold
on life is too slight...

07:54.223 --> 07:56.458
...to include any
Victorian hypocrisy.

07:56.459 --> 07:59.628
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have...

07:59.629 --> 08:03.398
...and who indulges, for the first
time, in parenthood at my age...

08:03.399 --> 08:05.008
...deserves all he gets.

08:06.135 --> 08:07.666
Well?

08:13.943 --> 08:15.435
Pay him.

08:15.711 --> 08:19.125
- Why?
- She signed these notes, didn't she?

08:23.419 --> 08:26.855
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $5000 to?

08:26.856 --> 08:29.925
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.227
I think he called himself a gambler.

08:33.229 --> 08:35.530
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

08:35.530 --> 08:36.943
They may be.

08:36.966 --> 08:38.719
Think they are?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.372
You want me to take this Geiger
off your back, right?

08:44.373 --> 08:46.174
Want to know anything?

08:46.175 --> 08:47.943
I just want to get rid of him.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.011
Might cost you a little.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.154
Thanks for the drink.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.951
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.281
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

09:10.433 --> 09:14.803
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.372
About the money, the general
has instructed me...

09:17.373 --> 09:20.008
...to give you a check
for whatever you require.

09:20.009 --> 09:21.743
Instructed you how?

09:21.744 --> 09:25.046
I see, sir. I forget
that you're a detective.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.515
By the way he rang his bell, sir.

09:27.516 --> 09:29.784
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

09:29.785 --> 09:32.287
Good for you.
I don't need any money now...

09:32.288 --> 09:35.428
...but when I do, I get
$ 25 a day and expenses.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.660
- How did she know I was here?
- She saw you through the window.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.496
I was obliged to tell her
who you were.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.989
I don't know as I like that.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.734
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

09:45.735 --> 09:48.169
Just having fun trying
to guess what they are.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.923
This way, sir.

09:52.742 --> 09:55.541
- Go right in. You're expected.
- Thanks.

10:00.216 --> 10:02.401
You wanted to see me?

10:07.657 --> 10:09.724
So you're a private detective?

10:09.725 --> 10:12.060
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

10:12.061 --> 10:15.463
Or else they were greasy men
snooping around hotel corridors.

10:15.464 --> 10:17.073
You're a mess, aren't you?

10:18.668 --> 10:20.568
I'm not very tall either.

10:20.569 --> 10:24.339
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

10:24.340 --> 10:27.008
I doubt if even that would help.

10:27.009 --> 10:30.412
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

10:30.413 --> 10:31.864
It shouldn't be too tough.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.316
I'd have thought
it took a little effort.

10:34.317 --> 10:35.690
Not too much.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.119
What will your first step be?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.455
- The usual one.
- There's a usual one?

10:40.456 --> 10:42.657
Sure there is.
It comes with diagrams...

10:42.658 --> 10:46.394
<i>...on page 47 of How to be a
Detective in Ten Easy Lessons...</i>

10:46.395 --> 10:48.880
...and your father
offered me a drink.

10:48.964 --> 10:50.932
You must've read one
on comedy.

10:50.933 --> 10:54.069
- Hear what I said about the drink?
- I'm serious. Father's...

10:54.070 --> 10:56.869
- I said your father...
- Help yourself!

10:59.575 --> 11:02.410
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.313
I want this case handled with
the least worry to him.

11:05.314 --> 11:07.649
That's the way
I was going to handle it.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.585
I see. No professional secrets?

11:10.586 --> 11:13.054
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

11:13.055 --> 11:14.664
Then, what...

11:19.028 --> 11:21.513
- How'd you like Dad?
- I liked him.

11:21.697 --> 11:24.299
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.138
I suppose you know who he is.

11:27.536 --> 11:29.865
You don't have to play poker with me.

11:29.905 --> 11:32.090
- Doesn't Dad want to find him?
- Do you?

11:32.308 --> 11:35.276
Of course. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.762
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.382
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

11:40.383 --> 11:43.184
I don't see what there is
to be cagey about.

11:43.185 --> 11:44.597
I don't like your manners!

11:44.653 --> 11:47.522
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

11:47.523 --> 11:50.325
I don't mind if you don't
like my manners. I don't either.

11:50.326 --> 11:51.993
I grieve over them evenings.

11:51.994 --> 11:54.729
I don't mind your drinking
your lunch out of a bottle.

11:54.730 --> 11:57.165
But don't waste your time
cross-examining me.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.770
People don't talk to me like that!

12:02.905 --> 12:06.408
Do you always think
you can handle people...

12:06.409 --> 12:08.476
...like trained seals?

12:08.611 --> 12:10.378
I usually get away with it too.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.580
How nice for you.

12:12.581 --> 12:15.146
Just what is it you're afraid of?

12:17.052 --> 12:19.220
Dad didn't see you
about Shawn, did he?

12:19.221 --> 12:20.516
Didn't he?

12:20.556 --> 12:22.657
Could you find him
if Dad wanted you to?

12:22.658 --> 12:24.345
Maybe. When did he go?

12:24.693 --> 12:25.827
About a month back.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.396
Drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

12:28.397 --> 12:31.266
They found his car parked
in some private garage.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.635
They? Who's they?

12:33.636 --> 12:35.048
Dad didn't tell you.

12:35.237 --> 12:39.207
He told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.409
That's what you wanted me to say.

12:41.410 --> 12:44.846
I'm sure I don't care
what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.137
I'm wasting your time.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.677
Goodbye, Mrs. Rutledge.

12:55.424 --> 12:57.258
Oh, Norris.

12:57.259 --> 13:00.428
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge
didn't want to see me.

13:00.429 --> 13:03.987
I'm sorry, sir.
I make many mistakes.

13:32.528 --> 13:34.929
- Did you find what you wanted?
- Yes, thanks.

13:34.930 --> 13:38.233
You don't look like a man who'd
be interested in first editions.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.458
I collect blondes in bottles too.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.488
Can I be of any assistance?

14:00.489 --> 14:04.125
<i>Would you happen
to have a Ben Hur, 1860?</i>

14:04.126 --> 14:07.362
<i>- A what?
- Do you have a Ben Hur, 1860?</i>

14:07.363 --> 14:08.619
A first edition?

14:08.697 --> 14:11.099
No, no, the third, the third!

14:11.100 --> 14:13.601
The one with the erratum on page 116.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.094
I'm afraid not.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.705
How about a Chevalier Audubon,
1840, full set?

14:17.706 --> 14:18.856
Not at the moment.

14:18.874 --> 14:20.483
You do sell books?

14:20.676 --> 14:23.111
What do those look like? Grapefruit?

14:23.112 --> 14:26.014
They look like books.
Maybe I'd better see Mr. Geiger.

14:26.015 --> 14:28.880
- He's not in just now.
- That's a pity because...

14:38.427 --> 14:40.795
I said, Mr. Geiger is not in!

14:40.796 --> 14:43.965
I heard you.
You needn't yell at me.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.936
I'm late for my lecture on
Argentine ceramics, so I won't wait.

14:47.937 --> 14:49.537
The word is "ceramics".

14:49.538 --> 14:52.073
And they ain't Argentine,
they're Egyptian!

14:52.074 --> 14:54.709
You did sell a book once, didn't you?

14:54.710 --> 14:56.477
I'll run along to the library.

14:56.478 --> 15:00.350
Or I could go to that bookstore
across the street, couldn't I?

15:00.583 --> 15:01.761
Do so.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.151
Thank you.

15:26.141 --> 15:28.076
Is there something I can do for you?

15:28.077 --> 15:31.674
- Would you do me a small favor?
- It depends on the favor.

15:31.981 --> 15:35.149
- You know Geiger's bookstore?
- I think I may have passed it.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.177
You know Geiger by sight?

15:37.486 --> 15:39.317
What's he look like?

15:39.321 --> 15:41.923
Wouldn't it be easier to go
and ask to see him?

15:41.924 --> 15:44.030
I've already done that.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.561
Know anything about rare books?

15:47.229 --> 15:48.760
You could try me.

15:48.764 --> 15:51.065
<i>Do you have a Ben Hur,
1860, third edition...</i>

15:51.066 --> 15:53.093
...with a duplicated line
on page 116?

16:01.610 --> 16:03.637
Or a Chevalier Audubon, 1840?

16:09.952 --> 16:12.887
Nobody would. There isn't one.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.988
The girl in Geiger's bookstore
didn't know that.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
I see.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.851
You begin to interest me, vaguely.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.365
I'm a private dick on a case.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.437
Perhaps I'm asking too much...

16:29.438 --> 16:31.884
...although it doesn't seem
too much to me.

16:34.510 --> 16:37.034
Geiger's in his early forties...

16:37.112 --> 16:38.904
...medium height...

16:38.914 --> 16:40.326
...fattish...

16:41.350 --> 16:44.852
...soft all over,
Charlie Chan mustache...

16:44.853 --> 16:46.265
...well-dressed...

16:46.288 --> 16:48.512
...wears a black hat...

16:48.757 --> 16:51.926
...affects a knowledge
of antiques and hasn't any...

16:51.927 --> 16:55.396
...and I think his left eye is glass.

16:55.397 --> 16:57.464
You'd make a good cop.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.987
Thanks.

17:01.470 --> 17:04.191
Gonna wait for him to come out?

17:05.808 --> 17:08.542
They don't close
for another hour or so.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.877
And it's raining pretty hard.

17:10.878 --> 17:12.252
I got my car and...

17:16.218 --> 17:18.419
That's right.
It is, isn't it?

17:18.420 --> 17:22.757
It just happens I got a bottle
of pretty good rye in my pocket.

17:22.758 --> 17:24.511
I'd rather get wet in here.

17:26.361 --> 17:28.009
Well!

17:38.407 --> 17:42.463
Looks like we're closed
for the rest of the afternoon.

17:47.449 --> 17:51.853
- Tell me more about this business.
- There isn't much to tell.

17:51.854 --> 17:53.502
What's the matter?

17:53.622 --> 17:56.526
I'm just wondering if you have to...

17:57.426 --> 17:59.650
Not necessarily.

18:06.602 --> 18:09.401
Little things like that make an...

18:09.938 --> 18:11.625
Hello!

18:25.020 --> 18:28.578
I hate to tell you, but that's
Geiger's car driving up.

18:29.825 --> 18:31.392
Who's the man getting out?

18:31.393 --> 18:34.297
Geiger's shadow.
His name's Carol Lundgren.

18:35.164 --> 18:36.197
Thanks.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.367
- If you ever want to buy a book...
- A Ben Hur, 1860?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.780
With duplications.

18:40.803 --> 18:42.254
So long.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.102
So long, pal.

23:10.839 --> 23:12.095
You're cute.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.142
And you're higher than a kite.
Come on, wake up.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.623
I know you. Doghouse Reilly.

23:19.214 --> 23:21.715
- You're cute.
- What do you know about this?

23:21.716 --> 23:23.783
Mr. Geiger, here on the floor.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.492
He's cute too.

23:27.722 --> 23:31.158
You got a dead man at your feet.
How did it happen?

23:31.159 --> 23:33.724
You talk a lot, Reilly.

23:34.696 --> 23:36.449
Come on!

23:43.438 --> 23:45.139
Lie down there and be quiet.

23:45.140 --> 23:47.246
All right, Reilly.

26:48.256 --> 26:50.087
Come on, we're going.

27:28.296 --> 27:30.297
- Good evening.
- Is Mrs. Rutledge in?

27:30.298 --> 27:31.790
- No, sir.
- The general?

27:31.800 --> 27:34.443
- He's asleep.
- Good. I got something in the car.

27:34.836 --> 27:36.903
She's all right.
Is the maid around?

27:37.372 --> 27:39.006
Yes, I'll get Matilda.

27:39.007 --> 27:41.041
Now wait a minute.
Not as I'm leaving.

27:41.042 --> 27:43.844
I haven't been here.
You haven't seen me at all.

27:43.845 --> 27:45.679
Kid hasn't been out of the house.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.614
I understand.
May I get you a cab?

27:47.615 --> 27:49.839
No, I'm all right.
Put her car away.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.399
- Hello, Bernie. Come in.
- Hello, Phil.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.695
Don't you ever go to bed?

30:20.735 --> 30:22.266
What you been doing?

30:22.270 --> 30:23.565
Just sitting around.

30:23.605 --> 30:25.292
All evening?

30:26.307 --> 30:27.407
What is it?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.209
Does it have to be something?

30:29.210 --> 30:31.912
You're a friend, but when
a man from Homicide...

30:31.913 --> 30:34.281
...just drops in at 2 a.m.,
I kind of...

30:34.282 --> 30:36.016
Working on cipher, huh?

30:36.017 --> 30:37.584
Just fooling around.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.853
You're working for the Sternwoods,
right?

30:39.854 --> 30:41.385
Thanks to you.

30:41.389 --> 30:43.023
Done anything for them yet?

30:43.024 --> 30:45.248
I started today.
Then the rain came.

30:45.627 --> 30:49.563
All right. They seem to be
a family that things happen to.

30:49.564 --> 30:51.865
There's a Packard
belonging to them...

30:51.866 --> 30:54.966
...washing around in the surf
off Lido Pier.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.671
And there's a guy in it.

30:57.672 --> 30:59.406
Couldn't be Regan, could it?

30:59.407 --> 31:01.121
Shawn Regan.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.011
That Irish ex-legger
old Sternwood hired...

31:04.012 --> 31:06.146
...to do his drinking for him?

31:06.147 --> 31:08.582
What would he be doing down there?

31:08.583 --> 31:11.527
What would anybody
be doing down there?

31:11.553 --> 31:14.721
That's what I'm going to Lido
to find out. Wanna come?

31:14.722 --> 31:16.331
Yeah, I do.

31:16.724 --> 31:19.367
- How's the weather?
- Clearing up.

31:19.627 --> 31:23.068
- What time did that call come in?
- About 15 minutes ago.

31:24.032 --> 31:27.290
- What kind of car you say it was?
- Packard.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.152
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hi, Ed.

31:45.186 --> 31:46.678
I see he's out.
Who is he?

31:46.688 --> 31:50.557
Owen Taylor. Sternwood's chauffeur,
according to his license.

31:50.558 --> 31:52.926
- What's the story?
- You can see it from here.

31:52.927 --> 31:55.295
There's where he went
through the railing.

31:55.396 --> 31:57.431
The rain stopped here about 9 p.m.

31:57.432 --> 32:01.841
The broken rails are dry inside.
That would put it about 9:30.

32:10.244 --> 32:11.979
Let's have it, doc.

32:11.980 --> 32:15.182
His neck's broken and something
hit him across the temple.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.351
What made the bruise?
Steering wheel?

32:17.352 --> 32:19.186
Whatever it was, it was covered.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.289
The wound had bled under
the skin while he was alive.

32:22.290 --> 32:24.191
- Blackjack?
- Could be.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.643
Bernie, funny thing.

32:25.660 --> 32:28.161
The hand throttle is set
halfway down.

32:28.162 --> 32:30.497
Thanks, Jim. So long, doc.

32:30.498 --> 32:32.722
All right, boys. Take him away.

32:36.004 --> 32:39.406
- Could be drunk or a suicide.
- Yeah, but it isn't.

32:39.407 --> 32:41.642
You know anything about Owen Taylor?

32:41.643 --> 32:43.844
Only that a few
Sternwood chauffeurs...

32:43.845 --> 32:47.103
...lost their jobs because
of the younger daughter, Carmen.

32:47.248 --> 32:49.349
Tell me what
you're working on, Phil.

32:49.350 --> 32:51.218
They told me blackmail.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.325
Who were they after? Carmen?

32:54.088 --> 32:56.657
This doesn't look like
the way you'd handle it.

32:56.658 --> 32:58.792
You know, I got a feeling that...

32:58.793 --> 33:01.854
Me? I didn't do this.

33:02.363 --> 33:04.431
What were you going to say, Phil?

33:04.432 --> 33:07.734
Give me another day, Bernie.
I may have something for you.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.422
Okay. Let's go home.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.335
- I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

33:22.684 --> 33:24.371
Do you remember me now?

33:24.719 --> 33:25.869
Now, see here!

33:25.920 --> 33:28.758
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

33:28.890 --> 33:32.993
I got something to sell.
Something Geiger wants. Is he in?

33:32.994 --> 33:35.495
No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

33:35.496 --> 33:37.998
Drop the veil.
I'm in the business myself.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.467
Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

33:40.468 --> 33:43.306
No, that wouldn't do.
If you'd come back tomorrow...

33:43.471 --> 33:45.263
Say, Agnes, you...

33:46.007 --> 33:47.721
Come on, Carol.

33:50.411 --> 33:52.125
Hurry up, will you?

33:53.181 --> 33:55.248
- Perhaps...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

33:55.249 --> 33:57.084
- What do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

33:57.085 --> 33:58.952
You'd better come tomorrow.

33:58.953 --> 34:01.138
In the morning? Early?

34:01.489 --> 34:04.171
Because it looks like
you're moving today.

34:15.703 --> 34:17.966
All right, driver. Let's go!

34:22.677 --> 34:25.581
Around the corner, then take it easy.

34:25.847 --> 34:28.648
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.022
I'm your girl, bud.

34:30.051 --> 34:31.842
It wouldn't be bad.

34:31.985 --> 34:36.277
That station wagon coming out
of the alley. That's the one.

35:21.669 --> 35:23.837
Here, sugar.
Buy yourself a cigar.

35:23.838 --> 35:27.140
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

35:27.141 --> 35:28.291
Day and night?

35:28.309 --> 35:31.867
Night's better.
I work during the day.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.591
- Good morning.
- You do get up.

35:44.592 --> 35:47.561
I was thinking you worked in bed,
like Marcel Proust.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.400
- Who's he?
- A French writer.

35:51.933 --> 35:54.118
Come into my boudoir.

36:02.210 --> 36:03.910
You don't put on a front.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.012
Not much money in this work
if you're honest.

36:06.013 --> 36:07.308
Are you honest?

36:07.348 --> 36:10.851
- We're starting that again?
- I'm sorry. Also, about yesterday.

36:10.852 --> 36:13.920
- Perhaps I was rude.
- We were both rude.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.856
You want to see me about Taylor?

36:15.857 --> 36:17.963
So you know about that.

36:18.492 --> 36:21.528
- Poor Owen.
- The DA's man took me down to Lido.

36:21.529 --> 36:23.930
He knew more about him than I did.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.900
He knew Owen Taylor wanted
to marry your sister.

36:26.901 --> 36:29.302
Perhaps it wouldn't
have been a bad idea.

36:29.303 --> 36:31.504
You see, he was in love with her.

36:31.505 --> 36:34.226
But I didn't come here about Owen.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.011
You still can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

36:38.012 --> 36:39.579
Not without his permission.

36:39.580 --> 36:42.418
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

36:43.918 --> 36:47.087
You better look at this.
A messenger brought it today.

36:47.088 --> 36:48.880
"Eight thirty-five".

36:48.923 --> 36:50.610
That's right.

36:52.093 --> 36:54.238
She takes a nice picture.

36:54.362 --> 36:56.830
They want 5000 for
the negative and prints.

36:56.831 --> 36:58.243
The demand came how?

36:58.266 --> 37:00.467
A woman phoned me
after it was delivered.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.969
- What else?
- There has to be something else?

37:02.970 --> 37:05.338
This thing isn't
worth $5000 to anybody.

37:05.339 --> 37:07.445
- They think it is.
- Why?

37:07.575 --> 37:09.876
She said if they didn't
get the money today...

37:09.877 --> 37:12.913
...I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

37:12.914 --> 37:15.315
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.728
What kind of a jam?

37:16.751 --> 37:18.582
I don't know.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.955
You know where
this picture was taken?

37:21.956 --> 37:25.158
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Or when?

37:25.159 --> 37:26.726
Talk to Carmen about it?

37:26.727 --> 37:29.529
She was asleep when I left.
She was sick last night.

37:29.530 --> 37:32.732
- She go out at all?
- Servants say she didn't.

37:32.733 --> 37:33.883
You?

37:33.901 --> 37:37.734
I was out all evening.
Police already checked that.

37:38.205 --> 37:40.193
Go ahead and scratch.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.312
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

37:45.313 --> 37:47.995
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

37:48.082 --> 37:50.350
- Why? You think...
- That he knew about this?

37:50.351 --> 37:52.182
I don't rule him out.

37:53.087 --> 37:54.988
Outside of what the woman said...

37:54.989 --> 37:57.593
...you don't know why
they want $5000 for it?

37:59.961 --> 38:01.795
That's why I came to you.

38:01.796 --> 38:05.498
There's five fingers on any glove.
Why didn't you go to the police?

38:05.499 --> 38:08.201
You were afraid they'd find
something I couldn't sit on.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.470
Then where would the Sternwoods be?

38:10.471 --> 38:13.336
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

38:20.081 --> 38:23.181
Police headquarters, please.

38:24.151 --> 38:25.982
Hello, this is Mrs...

38:28.422 --> 38:30.567
Hello. What do you want, please?

38:31.092 --> 38:32.225
What?

38:32.226 --> 38:33.757
I called you?

38:33.761 --> 38:35.553
Say, who is this?

38:35.896 --> 38:39.366
Sergeant Reilly?
There isn't any Sergeant Reilly here.

38:39.367 --> 38:42.232
Wait a minute.
You'd better talk to my mother.

38:45.272 --> 38:47.299
Hello. Who's this?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.010
The police?
This isn't a police station.

38:50.011 --> 38:51.462
If you know it, why did...

38:51.512 --> 38:55.031
Look, this is not a police station!

38:55.082 --> 38:57.450
What was that you said?

38:57.718 --> 39:00.583
My father should hear this.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.361
Hello. Who is this?

39:04.592 --> 39:06.693
Yeah, but she just told you that...

39:06.694 --> 39:08.628
You're the police!
He's the police.

39:08.629 --> 39:11.651
Well, that's different.
What can I do for you?

39:12.166 --> 39:13.617
I can do what?

39:13.701 --> 39:14.851
Where?

39:14.869 --> 39:18.663
Oh, no! I wouldn't like that,
and neither would my daughter.

39:18.873 --> 39:21.508
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

39:21.509 --> 39:24.649
You like to play games, don't you?

39:24.879 --> 39:26.780
Why did you stop me phoning?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.882
Because I'm working for your father.

39:28.883 --> 39:33.186
Or because I think I'm beginning to
like another one of the Sternwoods.

39:33.187 --> 39:35.869
I prefer the second reason.

39:36.023 --> 39:40.860
Well, let's get back to business.
Have you got $5000 in cash?

39:40.861 --> 39:42.662
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

39:42.663 --> 39:45.598
- Where from, your father?
- I'd rather not.

39:45.599 --> 39:47.169
Where would you get it?

39:47.201 --> 39:49.469
Well, from Eddie Mars.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.537
The gambler?

39:50.538 --> 39:53.440
That explains why you
haven't got $5000 in cash.

39:53.441 --> 39:55.233
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

39:55.543 --> 39:58.478
- How do you know he'll give it to you?
- I can get it.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.880
I've been a good customer
of Eddie Mars'.

40:00.881 --> 40:02.373
Another reason:

40:02.383 --> 40:06.186
There's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

40:06.187 --> 40:09.405
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

40:09.423 --> 40:11.411
That doesn't interest you?

40:12.026 --> 40:15.048
It might make it easier
for me to find him.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.496
If I were looking for him.

40:18.365 --> 40:20.333
Is Regan mixed up in this?

40:20.334 --> 40:23.570
No. Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

40:23.571 --> 40:26.773
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

40:26.774 --> 40:30.188
- Tell you what?
- What you're trying to find out.

40:30.744 --> 40:32.579
You know, it's a funny thing.

40:32.580 --> 40:35.115
You're trying to find out
why I was hired.

40:35.116 --> 40:36.950
And I'm trying to find out why you...

40:36.951 --> 40:39.252
You could go on forever,
couldn't you?

40:39.253 --> 40:42.197
It'll give us something
to talk about next time.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.999
Among other things.
Oh, Mrs. Rutledge.

40:45.059 --> 40:48.277
You wanted me to do something
about this, didn't you?

40:48.295 --> 40:49.996
That call, how'd you leave it?

40:49.997 --> 40:52.298
She's to call me at 6 p.m.
with instructions.

40:52.299 --> 40:54.467
Phone me when you've heard from her.

40:54.468 --> 40:57.170
Since you're going
to pay five grand for these...

40:57.171 --> 40:58.663
...you'd better take this.

40:58.672 --> 41:00.857
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

41:04.044 --> 41:05.845
Well, it wasn't intentional.

41:05.846 --> 41:08.070
Try it sometime.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.252
- What are you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly.

41:46.253 --> 41:48.388
The man that didn't grow very tall.

41:48.389 --> 41:50.993
What's the matter?
Couldn't you get in the house?

41:51.458 --> 41:53.787
Come on. I've got a key.

41:54.662 --> 41:58.142
- Where'd you leave your car?
- Around in back.

42:14.515 --> 42:16.007
Looking for something?

42:16.016 --> 42:18.518
How much do you remember
about last night?

42:18.519 --> 42:21.921
Remember what?
I was sick last night. I was home.

42:21.922 --> 42:24.624
Before you went home.
In that chair there.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.060
You remember, all right.

42:27.061 --> 42:29.696
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb!

42:29.697 --> 42:32.966
- Were you the one who was here?
- How much do you remember?

42:32.967 --> 42:35.134
Are you the police?

42:35.135 --> 42:37.103
No, I'm a friend of your father's.

42:37.104 --> 42:39.131
Who killed Geiger?

42:39.707 --> 42:41.238
Who else knows about it?

42:41.242 --> 42:43.176
What, that he's dead?
I don't know.

42:43.177 --> 42:47.080
Not the cops, or they'd be camping
here. Was it Joe Brody?

42:47.081 --> 42:49.605
Joe Brody. Who's he?

42:50.150 --> 42:52.552
I don't know how much trouble
you're used to...

42:52.553 --> 42:55.455
...but I hope you've had plenty
of practice dodging it.

42:55.456 --> 42:56.868
Did Brody kill him?

42:56.890 --> 42:58.538
Kill who?

43:02.630 --> 43:04.497
Yes, Joe did it.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.068
He did?

43:07.935 --> 43:09.230
Why?

43:09.770 --> 43:11.182
I don't know.

43:11.205 --> 43:13.640
But you're ready to tell
the police he did it?

43:13.641 --> 43:15.642
That is, if we can get
the photograph.

43:15.643 --> 43:16.676
You mean...?

43:16.677 --> 43:19.612
It's gone. I looked for it.
Brody took it with him.

43:19.613 --> 43:21.876
I've got to go home now.

43:22.116 --> 43:25.852
I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.321
I wouldn't say anything
about anything.

43:28.322 --> 43:31.791
That you were ever here.
Not even to your sister.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.977
Just leave it to Reilly.

43:34.395 --> 43:37.077
Your name isn't Reilly...

43:50.377 --> 43:53.713
Excuse the casual entrance.
The bell didn't answer.

43:54.148 --> 43:55.443
Mr. Geiger around?

43:55.482 --> 43:57.150
We don't know where he is.

43:57.151 --> 43:59.716
We found the door open
and just stepped in.

44:01.288 --> 44:02.897
- Friends of his?
- Business.

44:03.123 --> 44:05.111
We dropped in for a book.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.893
Any message if he comes back?

44:06.894 --> 44:10.229
No, I don't think so.
We won't bother you.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.839
Just a minute.

44:12.366 --> 44:13.933
The girl can go.

44:13.934 --> 44:17.070
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Suppose I don't want to talk?

44:17.071 --> 44:19.020
I've got two boys out in the car.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.307
It's like that, eh?

44:23.477 --> 44:25.387
Run along, angel.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.839
Your story doesn't sound right.

44:33.887 --> 44:36.032
That's too bad.
Got a better one?

44:36.990 --> 44:38.861
Maybe I can find one.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.734
Blood.
Quite a lot of blood.

44:47.735 --> 44:49.566
Is that so?

44:49.570 --> 44:52.514
- Do you mind?
- No, I'm used to it.

44:52.639 --> 44:55.041
I think we'll let
the police in on this.

44:55.042 --> 44:57.488
- We'll have some law...
- Yeah. Why not?

44:58.178 --> 44:59.473
Who are you, soldier?

44:59.513 --> 45:01.614
Marlowe.
I'm a private detective.

45:01.615 --> 45:03.146
- Who's the girl?
- A client.

45:03.150 --> 45:06.185
Geiger tried to throw a loop on her.
We came to talk.

45:06.186 --> 45:10.423
- Convenient, the door being open.
- Wasn't it? How'd you have a key?

45:10.424 --> 45:12.325
- That your business?
- Could be.

45:12.326 --> 45:13.699
I could make yours mine.

45:13.727 --> 45:16.631
You wouldn't like it.
The pay's too small.

45:17.765 --> 45:20.500
All right, I own this house.
Geiger's my tenant.

45:20.501 --> 45:23.202
- Now what do you think?
- You know some nice people.

45:23.203 --> 45:25.230
I take them as they come.

45:25.606 --> 45:26.784
Got any good ideas?

45:26.874 --> 45:29.275
One or two.
Somebody gunned Geiger.

45:29.276 --> 45:31.511
Or somebody got gunned
by Geiger, who ran away.

45:31.512 --> 45:34.614
Or he had meat for dinner
and likes to butcher in the parlor.

45:34.615 --> 45:38.251
No, I don't like it either.
Maybe you'd better call downtown.

45:38.252 --> 45:40.620
I don't get it.
I don't get your game.

45:40.621 --> 45:41.955
Don't you, Mr. Mars?

45:42.456 --> 45:44.891
Wondered why you didn't
ask me who I was.

45:44.892 --> 45:47.914
You're telling me Geiger was
in a racket of some kind.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.896
- What racket?
- I wouldn't know.

45:49.897 --> 45:52.198
But I'll tell you
something you missed.

45:52.199 --> 45:54.803
Somebody cleaned out
Geiger's store today.

45:54.902 --> 45:56.569
You talk too much.

45:56.570 --> 45:59.016
You really got those boys outside?

46:00.707 --> 46:01.857
Open the door.

46:01.875 --> 46:04.936
Open it yourself.
I already got a client.

46:09.216 --> 46:11.517
It's all right.
Just proving something.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.467
While you're here, look him over.

46:18.959 --> 46:20.860
- Pardon me.
- Who is he?

46:20.861 --> 46:23.796
Philip Marlowe, Hobart Arms,
Franklin Street.

46:23.797 --> 46:26.098
Special license,
deputy badge and all.

46:26.099 --> 46:27.277
All right, outside.

46:27.334 --> 46:29.602
- A shamus.
- The man said, outside.

46:29.603 --> 46:33.580
He said that.
That's what the man said.

46:35.342 --> 46:37.134
He kills me.

46:38.846 --> 46:40.024
Is he any good?

46:40.080 --> 46:43.015
Who? Sidney?
He's company for Pete.

46:43.016 --> 46:44.233
All right, talk.

46:44.284 --> 46:46.686
Not to you.
I already got a client.

46:46.687 --> 46:48.788
Who cleaned out Geiger's store?

46:48.789 --> 46:51.757
Lots of weather we're having.
Did it rain at Las Olindas?

46:51.758 --> 46:53.826
I might make it worth your while.

46:53.827 --> 46:55.358
I might make it worth yours.

46:55.362 --> 46:58.064
What do you care
who cleaned out Geiger's store?

46:58.065 --> 47:00.233
- I could make you talk.
- It's been tried.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.685
And?

47:01.969 --> 47:03.903
Why don't you call the cops?

47:03.904 --> 47:06.469
I think you'd better
get out of here.

47:07.207 --> 47:10.999
By the way,
how's Mrs. Mars these days?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.446
You take chances, Marlowe.

47:13.803 --> 47:15.752
I get paid to.

47:35.488 --> 47:38.323
Mrs. Rutledge. I've been
waiting to hear from you.

47:38.324 --> 47:41.160
<i>I'm sorry.
I have nothing to tell you.</i>

47:41.161 --> 47:43.428
<i>- She didn't call?
- No, she didn't.</i>

47:43.429 --> 47:47.365
Did you get the money
in case she does?

47:47.366 --> 47:52.369
<i>I have the money. I'll get in touch
with you as soon as she calls.</i>

47:52.370 --> 47:56.203
All right, I'll stay
right here until you call.

49:20.883 --> 49:22.295
Geiger?

49:22.317 --> 49:24.184
- You said what?
- Arthur Geiger.

49:24.185 --> 49:26.186
The guy with the blackmail racket.

49:26.187 --> 49:29.589
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- You're Joe Brody?

49:29.590 --> 49:31.858
- So what?
- So you're Joe Brody.

49:31.859 --> 49:34.293
And you don't know Geiger.
That's very funny.

49:34.294 --> 49:37.963
You've got a funny sense of humor.
Take it somewhere else.

49:37.964 --> 49:41.400
Joe, you got Geiger's stuff.
I got his sucker list.

49:41.401 --> 49:43.334
Don't you think we ought to talk?

49:43.335 --> 49:44.786
Now!

49:45.838 --> 49:48.598
All right. If you think
you got something.

49:53.044 --> 49:54.614
You alone, Joe?

49:55.446 --> 49:57.591
Except for this.

49:58.183 --> 50:02.618
My, my, such a lot of guns
around town and so few brains.

50:02.619 --> 50:04.787
You're the second guy
today that thinks...

50:04.788 --> 50:08.006
...a gat in the hand
means the world by the tail.

50:08.826 --> 50:10.692
Put it down, Joe.

50:10.693 --> 50:13.461
The other guy was Eddie Mars.
You ever hear of him?

50:13.462 --> 50:16.698
If he gets wise to where you were
last night, you'll hear of him.

50:16.699 --> 50:18.499
What would I be to Eddie Mars?

50:18.500 --> 50:20.501
I don't know if you don't.

50:20.502 --> 50:22.903
Look, don't get me wrong.

50:22.904 --> 50:24.505
I'm not a tough guy.

50:24.506 --> 50:25.684
Just careful.

50:25.841 --> 50:27.333
You're not careful enough.

50:27.342 --> 50:30.376
That play with Geiger's stuff
was terrible.

50:30.377 --> 50:33.913
Don't kid yourself I won't
use this if I have to.

50:33.914 --> 50:35.048
What's your story?

50:35.049 --> 50:37.349
Why don't you ask
your friend to come out?

50:37.350 --> 50:39.418
She must get tired
of holding her breath.

50:39.419 --> 50:41.253
Come on out, Agnes.

50:41.254 --> 50:42.387
Hello, sugar.

50:42.388 --> 50:44.423
I knew you were trouble.
I told Joe...

50:44.424 --> 50:47.562
Ask Mrs. Rutledge to come out too.

50:49.695 --> 50:50.873
What did you come for?

50:50.929 --> 50:53.431
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I don't need you.

50:53.432 --> 50:54.465
Keep out of it!

50:54.466 --> 50:56.566
I don't want you here.
Will you get out?

50:56.567 --> 51:00.003
But he won't let me.
He's curious, bothered and wondering.

51:00.004 --> 51:02.272
You bet I'm wondering
and I'll find out.

51:02.273 --> 51:03.907
- Sit down.
- Stop waving that gun.

51:03.908 --> 51:06.876
I didn't do anything.
Can't you talk without that?

51:06.877 --> 51:08.408
Don't argue with the man.

51:08.411 --> 51:11.113
- You're ruining things.
- I'm not. If you'd...

51:11.114 --> 51:12.606
Say, look!

51:12.616 --> 51:14.215
What are you up here for?

51:14.216 --> 51:17.986
To keep her from paying you off,
and to take the cops off your neck.

51:17.987 --> 51:19.321
What cops?

51:19.355 --> 51:23.070
The cops that want to know
where the lead in Geiger came from.

51:23.491 --> 51:25.125
Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

51:25.126 --> 51:26.894
- I didn't know...
- The cops don't yet.

51:26.895 --> 51:28.766
He wasn't alone
when you shot him.

51:29.264 --> 51:33.232
Either you didn't notice that
or you got scared and ran away.

51:33.233 --> 51:35.401
But you had nerve enough
to take the film.

51:35.402 --> 51:38.237
And nerve enough
to come back and hide the body.

51:38.238 --> 51:39.839
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

51:39.840 --> 51:42.274
So you could clean out the store...

51:42.275 --> 51:44.996
...before the law knew
there was a murder.

51:45.044 --> 51:48.413
You take chances. It's lucky
for you I didn't shoot Geiger.

51:48.414 --> 51:52.116
But you can step off for it anyway.
You're made-to-order for the rap.

51:52.117 --> 51:53.295
You think you've got me?

51:53.351 --> 51:54.568
- Positive.
- How come?

51:54.619 --> 51:59.088
I told you, there was a witness.
Now don't go simple on me.

51:59.089 --> 52:01.691
You mean Carmen.
She'd say anything.

52:01.692 --> 52:03.826
So you have got that picture.

52:03.827 --> 52:05.461
I guess you think I'm dumb.

52:05.462 --> 52:07.697
Just average, for a grafter.

52:07.698 --> 52:10.265
You see, either you were
there last night...

52:10.266 --> 52:13.135
...or you got the picture
from somebody who was.

52:13.136 --> 52:14.836
You knew Carmen was there...

52:14.837 --> 52:18.039
...because you had your girlfriend
threaten Mrs. Rutledge.

52:18.040 --> 52:21.108
The only way you could have known
was by being there...

52:21.109 --> 52:23.945
...and seeing what happened.
Or having the picture.

52:23.946 --> 52:25.096
Make sense?

52:25.113 --> 52:26.408
Who are you?

52:26.447 --> 52:28.982
A guy who gets paid to do
people's laundry.

52:28.983 --> 52:31.718
And all I'll get out
of it is that picture.

52:31.719 --> 52:34.087
How about some dough?
I'm down to nickels.

52:34.088 --> 52:37.842
Not from my client.
Get the picture, Joe.

52:41.661 --> 52:43.532
Stay right there.

52:46.999 --> 52:49.026
Here. Watch him.

53:02.113 --> 53:04.113
- Take it easy.
- I want my picture.

53:04.114 --> 53:05.801
- Now...
- I want my picture.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.641
You shot Geiger.

53:09.419 --> 53:10.714
Hold it!

53:12.688 --> 53:16.404
Get up. You look like a Pekinese.
And since I'm collecting guns...

53:16.859 --> 53:18.860
Sit down, sugar.
Now where were we?

53:18.861 --> 53:21.843
Oh, yes, you were just about
to get something.

53:31.572 --> 53:33.473
There better not be
any more prints.

53:33.474 --> 53:35.044
There won't be.

53:40.346 --> 53:42.831
Can I have my picture now?

53:43.950 --> 53:45.100
Can I have my gun?

53:45.151 --> 53:46.301
Later.

53:49.221 --> 53:51.555
You're cute. I like you.

53:51.556 --> 53:56.260
This is nothing. I got a Balinese
dancing girl tattooed on my chest.

53:56.261 --> 53:58.405
You better take her home.

53:59.830 --> 54:01.865
I suppose I should thank you.

54:01.866 --> 54:04.704
No, just don't lie to me next time.

54:04.969 --> 54:06.800
Come on, Carmen.

54:08.471 --> 54:10.080
Hold it, Joe.

54:15.178 --> 54:17.745
You got off easy, Joe.
What's the matter, sugar?

54:17.746 --> 54:20.081
- He gives me a pain...
- Goes for me too.

54:20.082 --> 54:21.416
You got the photos.
Get out.

54:21.450 --> 54:23.217
- Where's the pain?
- In my...

54:23.218 --> 54:24.285
Get out!

54:24.286 --> 54:26.920
Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

54:26.921 --> 54:28.177
I told you to get out.

54:28.222 --> 54:30.323
What difference does it make now?

54:30.324 --> 54:32.626
Why'd you put the bee
on Mrs. Rutledge?

54:32.627 --> 54:36.128
I tapped the old man six months ago.
I figured it might not work twice.

54:36.129 --> 54:38.564
Why'd you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him?

54:38.565 --> 54:41.167
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

54:41.168 --> 54:45.537
I figured she might have a thing
or two she wouldn't want him to know.

54:45.538 --> 54:48.139
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that too.

54:48.140 --> 54:50.442
Say, Joe, how'd you get that picture?

54:50.443 --> 54:52.810
You got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

54:52.811 --> 54:55.279
I don't know anything about it.
Do I, Agnes?

54:55.280 --> 54:57.848
- But you just gave it to me.
- A half-smart guy.

54:57.849 --> 54:59.583
That's what I always draw.

54:59.584 --> 55:03.519
Never once a man who's smart
all the way around the course.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.815
Did I hurt you much?

55:04.855 --> 55:06.589
You and every other man.

55:06.590 --> 55:08.082
Where'd you get that picture?

55:08.258 --> 55:09.826
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

55:09.827 --> 55:13.240
- Got an alibi for last night?
- I was here with Agnes.

55:14.063 --> 55:15.831
That's a great witness.

55:15.832 --> 55:18.867
You can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

55:18.868 --> 55:20.240
A couple of murders?

55:20.268 --> 55:23.537
I mean two murders. Where were you
about 7:30 last night?

55:23.538 --> 55:24.911
Where were you?

55:24.940 --> 55:27.108
All right, I was watching
Geiger's place.

55:27.109 --> 55:28.560
Why?

55:28.577 --> 55:31.778
- To get something on him.
- Look at me while you're talking.

55:31.779 --> 55:34.247
It was raining hard
and I was in my car.

55:34.248 --> 55:38.250
There was a car out front and another
down the hill. I was in back.

55:38.251 --> 55:40.185
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

55:40.186 --> 55:43.455
There was a big Packard near
where I was, so I took a look.

55:43.456 --> 55:45.858
It was registered to the Sternwoods.

55:45.859 --> 55:49.760
Nothing happened, so I got tired
of waiting and I went home.

55:49.761 --> 55:51.963
Know where that Packard is now?

55:51.964 --> 55:54.132
It's in the sheriff's garage.

55:54.133 --> 55:57.701
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier this morning.

55:57.702 --> 55:59.503
There was a dead man in it.

55:59.504 --> 56:02.506
It was pointed toward
the pier and the throttle pulled out.

56:02.507 --> 56:04.908
- You can't pin that on me.
- I can try.

56:04.909 --> 56:06.700
Sit down, Joe.

56:08.645 --> 56:11.981
The dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffeur.

56:11.982 --> 56:14.983
He went up to Geiger's
because he was sweet on Carmen.

56:14.984 --> 56:17.719
He didn't like the games
Geiger was playing.

56:17.720 --> 56:20.889
He let himself in the back
with a jimmy and he had a gun.

56:20.890 --> 56:24.791
The gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

56:24.792 --> 56:28.428
Owen ran with the film.
You went after him and got it.

56:28.429 --> 56:30.731
All right, you're right.
I heard the shots...

56:30.732 --> 56:33.900
...and saw him run out and
enter the Packard and away.

56:33.901 --> 56:35.313
I followed him.

56:35.335 --> 56:37.859
He turned west on Sunset.

56:38.071 --> 56:40.039
And beyond Beverly...

56:40.040 --> 56:44.209
...he skidded off the road
and came to a stop.

56:44.210 --> 56:46.745
So I came up and played copper.

56:46.746 --> 56:50.348
He had a gun. He was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

56:50.349 --> 56:53.384
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

56:53.385 --> 56:55.491
That's the last I saw of him.

56:56.388 --> 57:00.257
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly.

57:00.258 --> 57:02.926
And you want me to believe
somebody came along...

57:02.927 --> 57:05.929
...ran that car to the ocean,
pushed it off the pier...

57:05.930 --> 57:07.764
...then hid Geiger's body?

57:07.765 --> 57:10.065
- Well, I didn't...
- Somebody did.

57:10.066 --> 57:12.467
You wanted time to take over.

57:12.468 --> 57:14.436
You can't prove I did it.

57:14.437 --> 57:16.605
I don't particularly want to.

57:16.606 --> 57:21.014
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

57:21.443 --> 57:23.889
Maybe you and I can make
a little deal.

57:24.513 --> 57:25.886
Go ahead.

57:32.019 --> 57:33.392
Maybe she's back.

57:33.421 --> 57:36.103
If she is, she hasn't got her gun.

58:55.627 --> 58:57.458
You got a match, bud?

59:00.665 --> 59:02.932
What'll it be, kid?
Me or the cops?

59:02.933 --> 59:04.464
What do you want?

59:07.672 --> 59:10.615
Sit in that car,
back of the wheel. You drive.

59:15.412 --> 59:19.623
As soon as this police car goes by,
we're going to Geiger's house.

59:20.516 --> 59:22.984
By the way, Carol,
you shot the wrong guy.

59:22.985 --> 59:25.275
Brody didn't kill Geiger.

59:26.121 --> 59:27.833
All right, let's go.

59:50.042 --> 59:53.679
- You got a key. Let's go in.
- Who said I got a key?

59:58.383 --> 59:59.678
All right, come on!

01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:02.868
Maybe you need this.

01:01:11.148 --> 01:01:13.097
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Bernie?</i>

01:01:13.216 --> 01:01:15.050
<i>Is this who I think it is?</i>

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.619
It's Marlowe.
How are you fixed for red points?

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.032
<i>I haven't got any.</i>

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:20.585
Who has?

01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:23.825
I got some cold meat set out,
might interest you.

01:01:23.826 --> 01:01:25.426
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:01:25.427 --> 01:01:29.263
You find a gun on Owen Taylor
when they fished him out of the drink?

01:01:29.264 --> 01:01:33.434
- That's police business.
- I know it's police business.

01:01:33.435 --> 01:01:36.536
But if they did,
it had three empty shells in it.

01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:39.172
You come up to
7244 Laverne Terrace...

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:41.574
...off Laurel Canyon.
I'll show you where the slugs went.

01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:44.518
<i>- I'll be right out.
- I'll be waiting for you.</i>

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:47.142
What did you hide Geiger's body for?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.148
- Do you admit shooting Brody?
- Take a jump, Jack.

01:01:50.149 --> 01:01:52.817
He doesn't have to admit it.
Here's his gun.

01:01:52.818 --> 01:01:54.269
Come on.

01:01:56.855 --> 01:01:59.723
You too, Phil.
The DA is waiting for us.

01:01:59.724 --> 01:02:02.627
On the way, you and I
can have a little talk.

01:02:09.033 --> 01:02:11.733
The DA isn't going
to like this very much.

01:02:11.734 --> 01:02:13.402
Yeah, I know.

01:02:13.403 --> 01:02:15.370
Cronjager'll be there too.

01:02:15.371 --> 01:02:17.124
That won't help.

01:02:17.273 --> 01:02:20.875
Maybe I can needle him enough
to take the heat off you.

01:02:20.876 --> 01:02:22.629
Appreciate it.

01:02:23.612 --> 01:02:24.762
Thanks.

01:02:33.588 --> 01:02:35.989
- Evening, Mr. Wilde.
- Hi, Marlowe.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:37.591
Hi, Cronjager.

01:02:37.592 --> 01:02:39.458
- You know Marlowe?
- I know him.

01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:42.127
Sit down. Unless
you'd rather be on your feet.

01:02:42.128 --> 01:02:43.345
You'd better start.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.098
I guess the best way to begin is...

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.578
...to ask Cronjager what he's got
on the Randall Place killing.

01:02:50.236 --> 01:02:51.648
Brody was the name.

01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:55.473
We got Brody with two slugs in him,
two guns that hadn't been fired...

01:02:55.474 --> 01:02:58.475
...a dame trying to start a car
that didn't belong to her.

01:02:58.476 --> 01:03:00.577
Hers was next to it.
The same model.

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:03.914
She acted rattled.
We brought her in and she talked.

01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:06.849
- She didn't see the killer...
- That's all you got?

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.885
- It only happened an hour ago.
- I know.

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:11.654
- You expect the movie of the killing?
- Not from you.

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:14.590
That'll do.
Go ahead, Bernie.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:18.227
Your killer's down below, handcuffed.
Here's the gun he used.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.363
- Marlowe got him for you.
- How...?

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.298
Oh, yeah, there are a couple
more deaths involved.

01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:27.368
One of them in your territory.
Maybe you know about it.

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:29.703
- Marlowe uncovered them too.
- Keep going.

01:03:29.704 --> 01:03:33.740
And the car that was lifted out
of the ocean with a dead guy in it.

01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:34.891
What about it?

01:03:34.942 --> 01:03:38.978
The guy was chauffeur to a rich family
that was being blackmailed.

01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:42.015
Mr. Wilde recommended Marlowe
to the family through me.

01:03:42.016 --> 01:03:44.200
He'd been playing it
close to the vest.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.010
I love private dicks who do that.

01:03:47.186 --> 01:03:49.454
And you don't have
to be so coy about it.

01:03:49.455 --> 01:03:51.490
I don't have to be coy.

01:03:51.491 --> 01:03:53.624
I don't often get to be coy with you.

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.826
I dig up stuff
your men don't see.

01:03:55.827 --> 01:03:57.962
- My men don't...
- That's enough.

01:03:57.963 --> 01:04:01.331
Sit down, captain.
And you, Bernie, go on with it.

01:04:01.332 --> 01:04:04.634
Well, this chauffeur
killed a guy last night.

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:06.636
A guy named Geiger.

01:04:06.637 --> 01:04:09.639
He ran a racket, back of
a bookstore on Hollywood Blvd.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.607
In your territory.

01:04:11.608 --> 01:04:15.624
But you hadn't heard about Geiger,
had you? Or the racket.

01:04:16.212 --> 01:04:18.414
Marlowe, tell it to them.

01:04:18.415 --> 01:04:20.248
- Well...
- I hadn't heard...

01:04:20.249 --> 01:04:21.816
- You want to talk?
- Go ahead.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:23.618
You'd better get this down.

01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:26.484
Yesterday, General Sternwood
showed me a letter...

01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:29.923
Brody stalled, but when Agnes
didn't back him up...

01:04:29.924 --> 01:04:32.159
...he began to get cold feet.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.495
While I was persuading Brody to talk,
the doorbell rang.

01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:40.032
He opened it and somebody shot him.
Well, you know the rest.

01:04:40.033 --> 01:04:43.903
Outside of Taylor, Lundgren and Brody,
nobody knew about Geiger.

01:04:43.904 --> 01:04:46.010
His secretary.
She got it from Brody.

01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:48.039
No one else was near the house?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.043
So all you failed to do was report
a murder that happened last night?

01:04:52.044 --> 01:04:55.779
You fooled around all day so he
could commit a second killing today.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.549
That's all?
I was in a tough spot. I was wrong.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:02.686
But I wanted to protect my client.
I didn't know he'd gun for Brody.

01:05:02.687 --> 01:05:03.787
Just worked out that way.

01:05:03.788 --> 01:05:06.623
That's police business.
You're still in a tough spot.

01:05:06.624 --> 01:05:08.291
Have you told it complete?

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:11.995
I left out personal details and
intend to keep on leaving them out.

01:05:11.996 --> 01:05:14.396
- Why?
- My client's entitled to protection.

01:05:14.397 --> 01:05:17.132
You think.
I got another idea.

01:05:17.133 --> 01:05:18.867
You could lose your license.

01:05:18.868 --> 01:05:23.204
Your division's got two murders,
both solved, with both killers.

01:05:23.205 --> 01:05:25.706
I don't see what you can gain
by starting trouble.

01:05:25.707 --> 01:05:27.775
Besides, there are
other people in this.

01:05:27.776 --> 01:05:30.144
What you bring out
wouldn't do any good.

01:05:30.445 --> 01:05:34.199
If Marlowe wants to forget it,
your office can take the credit.

01:05:34.782 --> 01:05:36.650
I hate to let him get away with it.

01:05:36.651 --> 01:05:41.440
Besides, it won't do you any good
by watching this over in the papers.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:46.825
- What do you want?
- I've got a prisoner to turn over.

01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:48.540
So long, Wilde.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.485
Eddie, you can go.

01:05:56.502 --> 01:05:59.563
Just a minute.
Leave that notebook here.

01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:07.744
You'll have to make another
statement for our files.

01:06:07.745 --> 01:06:10.546
You think we can keep
the two killings separate...

01:06:10.547 --> 01:06:13.032
...and keep Sternwood's
name out of it?

01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:15.584
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:15.652 --> 01:06:18.520
Know why I'm doing this
instead of tearing your ear off?

01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:22.393
- I expected to lose both of them.
- You should have.

01:06:22.491 --> 01:06:25.860
- What are you getting for all this?
- $ 25 a day and expenses.

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:29.363
- That's $50 and a little gasoline.
- About that.

01:06:29.364 --> 01:06:32.833
For that, you're willing
to get in touch with the law...

01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:34.768
...and lose your license?

01:06:34.769 --> 01:06:37.411
I don't like it, but I'm on a case.

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:40.973
Just what did General Sternwood
really want you for?

01:06:40.974 --> 01:06:43.142
To settle this business with Geiger.

01:06:43.143 --> 01:06:48.146
Are you sure it didn't have anything
to do with that ex-bootlegger Regan?

01:06:48.147 --> 01:06:49.403
What makes you say that?

01:06:49.449 --> 01:06:53.518
I had an idea that he thought
Regan was mixed up in this.

01:06:53.519 --> 01:06:56.921
And he really wanted you
to find out that Regan isn't.

01:06:56.922 --> 01:06:59.323
Shawn's no blackmailer.
I know him.

01:06:59.324 --> 01:07:01.391
You'd better find him and make sure.

01:07:01.426 --> 01:07:02.721
Maybe I had.

01:07:02.761 --> 01:07:05.361
- And buy Bernie a box of cigars.
- I'll do that.

01:07:05.362 --> 01:07:09.165
- He's earned it.
- Someday, Cronjager'll blow up and bust.

01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.770
- So long, Mr. Wilde.
- So long.

01:07:18.541 --> 01:07:19.575
Thanks, Bernie.

01:07:19.576 --> 01:07:22.610
Forget it.
Cronjager's always been my pigeon.

01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:23.906
What happens now?

01:07:23.946 --> 01:07:25.747
Looks like I'll get paid off.

01:07:25.748 --> 01:07:27.515
That'll end it, huh?

01:07:27.516 --> 01:07:29.183
I don't know, Bernie.

01:07:29.184 --> 01:07:31.151
This began as a case of blackmail.

01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:33.954
All at once, things started
to happen for no reason.

01:07:33.955 --> 01:07:35.982
No reason at all.

01:07:37.592 --> 01:07:40.259
- Now it's over...
- You think there's more.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.594
Well, so do you.

01:07:41.628 --> 01:07:43.963
What's your dope
on Regan's disappearance?

01:07:43.964 --> 01:07:47.933
Missing Persons has all we've got.
It boils down to one thing:

01:07:47.934 --> 01:07:52.342
Eddie Mars' blonde wife disappeared
the same time Regan did.

01:07:53.672 --> 01:07:55.962
Mars ever ask you to find her?

01:07:56.642 --> 01:08:00.010
Could be people want us
to think they ran off together.

01:08:00.011 --> 01:08:01.645
Is that just a hunch?

01:08:01.646 --> 01:08:02.902
Almost.

01:08:03.681 --> 01:08:05.212
Why don't you play it?

01:08:05.216 --> 01:08:08.433
That's what the DA said.
I think I will.

01:08:14.992 --> 01:08:17.259
- Well!
- Good morning.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.791
And how are you today?

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:21.085
Better than last night.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.978
Come on in.

01:08:27.469 --> 01:08:29.336
No answer on your telephone.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:31.325
It was unplugged.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.608
I wanted to get some sleep.
I was tired.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:38.278
I was worried and wanted to know
what happened after I left.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.380
Worried or curious?

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:43.082
Both.
Then I read the morning papers.

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:46.618
We were lucky. We managed to keep
the Sternwoods out of it.

01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:49.354
My father and I were
both very pleased.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:51.790
He hopes you didn't involve
yourself too deeply.

01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:53.457
You tell him you were there?

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:55.660
Nothing would be gained
by telling him.

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:59.912
You're probably right. Anything
special you wanted to see me about?

01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:05.135
Dad asked me to give you a check.
He considers the case closed.

01:09:05.136 --> 01:09:06.587
It is, isn't it?

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:08.638
Well, as regards Geiger, yes.

01:09:08.639 --> 01:09:13.505
Then it's completely closed.
I hope this is satisfactory.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:15.684
Five hundred!

01:09:15.712 --> 01:09:19.728
It's a lot more than I expected,
but welcome just the same.

01:09:21.116 --> 01:09:22.216
Here you are.

01:09:22.218 --> 01:09:25.486
Here's the three promissory notes
and Geiger's card.

01:09:25.487 --> 01:09:29.090
As for the photographs, I'll destroy
them myself, if you don't mind.

01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:31.291
We appreciate what you've done.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.627
Someday, my father wants
to thank you himself.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.129
Fine, I'll come and
drink more of his brandy.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.346
Maybe he'd talk some more
about Shawn Regan.

01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:42.635
My brandy's just as good.

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.203
If you can stop being
a detective long enough...

01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:46.805
...to have a drink with me.

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:48.874
I'd like to. I like brandy.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:50.746
I have lots of it.

01:10:07.358 --> 01:10:09.923
"Completely closed".

01:10:18.668 --> 01:10:20.869
<i>- Long distance.
- Hello, long distance?</i>

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.350
This is Philip Marlowe at Main 9-1494.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.575
<i>Hello? I have Mr. Mars for you.</i>

01:10:27.576 --> 01:10:29.800
Thanks. Put him on.

01:10:30.746 --> 01:10:32.617
Hello, Mr. Mars?

01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:35.348
Hello, Eddie.
This is Phil Marlowe.

01:10:35.349 --> 01:10:38.285
<i>- I called because I want to see you.
- Sure. When?</i>

01:10:38.286 --> 01:10:42.577
<i>- I could drive up tonight.
- Okay, come ahead.</i>

01:10:58.203 --> 01:10:59.890
Good evening.

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:06.276
Mr. Mars around? I'm Marlowe.
He's expecting me.

01:11:06.277 --> 01:11:09.115
Wait here and I'll find out.

01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:18.242
<i>He would spend it on the ponies</i>

01:11:18.288 --> 01:11:22.264
<i>He would spend it on the girls</i>

01:11:22.425 --> 01:11:26.795
<i>Buy his mother lovely roses</i>

01:11:26.796 --> 01:11:31.348
<i>For her dear old hennaed curls</i>

01:11:31.866 --> 01:11:35.843
<i>But when his wife said, "Sweetie...</i>

01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:41.072
<i>... what did you get for me?"</i>

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:46.036
<i>He socked her in the choppers</i>

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:49.848
<i>Such a sweet, sweet guy was he</i>

01:11:49.849 --> 01:11:54.219
<i>And her tears flowed like wine</i>

01:11:57.189 --> 01:12:00.992
<i>She's a real sad tomato</i>

01:12:00.993 --> 01:12:04.054
<i>She's a busted valentine</i>

01:12:04.096 --> 01:12:08.298
<i>Knows her mama done told her</i>

01:12:08.299 --> 01:12:11.601
<i>That a man is darned unkind</i>

01:12:11.602 --> 01:12:14.467
<i>I'm a telling you, mister</i>

01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:18.149
<i>She was a sob, sob sister</i>

01:12:19.109 --> 01:12:20.909
<i>Lying on a pillow</i>

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.127
<i>Weeping like a willow</i>

01:12:22.612 --> 01:12:26.588
<i>My, oh, my
How that baby could cry</i>

01:12:27.983 --> 01:12:31.486
<i>And her tears flowed like wine</i>

01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:35.934
<i>Yes, her tears flowed like wine</i>

01:12:37.892 --> 01:12:41.987
- Hello, boys.
- Stop it. He's waiting to see you.

01:12:46.867 --> 01:12:48.017
Thanks.

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:53.605
Glad you came.
You never been here before?

01:12:53.606 --> 01:12:55.774
First time.
I wouldn't be here now...

01:12:55.775 --> 01:12:59.778
...if you hadn't told me
I could come up here if I needed help.

01:12:59.779 --> 01:13:01.151
Drink?

01:13:05.817 --> 01:13:08.352
I like the way you've
handled this whole thing.

01:13:08.353 --> 01:13:11.921
It made me sore at first, but I see
now you knew what you were doing.

01:13:11.922 --> 01:13:14.067
You and I could get along.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:17.160
I like to pay my bills as I go.

01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:19.881
- How much do I owe you?
- For what?

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:22.106
Still careful, huh?

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.634
All right, then.
I want some information...

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:27.779
...about Shawn Regan.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.908
You got it from
the Bureau of Missing Persons.

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.476
- You get around.
- My boys do.

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.410
- Where is he?
- I haven't any idea.

01:13:37.411 --> 01:13:39.446
You didn't bump him off, did you?

01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:41.281
No. You think I did?

01:13:41.282 --> 01:13:43.767
- That's what I came to ask.
- You're kidding.

01:13:43.818 --> 01:13:45.728
All right, I'm kidding.

01:13:47.687 --> 01:13:51.520
You didn't do it and your boys
aren't good enough to. I knew Regan.

01:13:52.158 --> 01:13:54.185
You said you weren't looking for Regan.

01:13:54.194 --> 01:13:56.961
I wasn't then.
Maybe I just got curious.

01:13:56.962 --> 01:13:59.997
I finally got it
that the general was worried...

01:13:59.998 --> 01:14:02.700
...Regan might be mixed up
in this blackmail business.

01:14:02.701 --> 01:14:05.202
Sternwood can turn over now
and go back to sleep.

01:14:05.203 --> 01:14:09.376
It was Geiger's own racket.
I did some inquiring myself today.

01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:12.309
When Geiger and Brody got gunned,
it finished it.

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.409
- That, I'm sure of.
- It's finished, then.

01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:20.382
The general thinks like you do.
He paid me off today.

01:14:20.383 --> 01:14:22.150
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:25.320
I wish he'd hire you to keep
that daughter of his home.

01:14:25.321 --> 01:14:26.988
- She's there now.
- I heard her.

01:14:26.989 --> 01:14:28.857
She's not very popular here.

01:14:28.858 --> 01:14:31.959
When she loses, she doubles and
I get a fistful of paper.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.195
- If she wins, she takes my money.
- Don't you get it back?

01:14:35.196 --> 01:14:38.465
- She spends it somewhere else.
- Oh, she goes on the cuff.

01:14:38.466 --> 01:14:40.689
Keep her out of here, then.

01:14:41.702 --> 01:14:44.737
- I took the trip for nothing.
- Sorry I can't help you.

01:14:44.738 --> 01:14:46.739
You mind if I look
the place over?

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:49.142
Take that door,
it comes out behind the tables.

01:14:49.143 --> 01:14:51.610
No, thanks. I'll go out
with the other suckers.

01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:53.512
Maybe someday I can do
you a favor.

01:14:53.513 --> 01:14:54.546
Maybe.

01:14:54.547 --> 01:14:56.837
There's one thing that puzzles me.

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:59.898
You don't seem in a hurry
to find that wife of yours.

01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:03.287
I hear she's not the kind of wife
a guy wants to lose.

01:15:03.288 --> 01:15:06.790
Could it be you know where she is,
and maybe Regan too?

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:10.767
Stop being curious. What's between
me and my wife is between us.

01:15:11.095 --> 01:15:12.351
Sorry.

01:15:13.197 --> 01:15:16.533
Oh, Eddie, you don't have
anybody watching me, do you?

01:15:16.534 --> 01:15:18.734
Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe?

01:15:18.735 --> 01:15:19.768
No. Why should I?

01:15:19.769 --> 01:15:23.505
I can't imagine, unless you're worried
about where I am all the time.

01:15:23.506 --> 01:15:25.691
I don't like you that well.

01:15:26.742 --> 01:15:28.312
So long, Eddie.

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:36.816
Mr. Marlowe?

01:15:36.817 --> 01:15:38.923
- Mrs. Rut...
- Mrs. Rut...

01:15:39.921 --> 01:15:40.954
You better take it.

01:15:40.955 --> 01:15:43.823
Mrs. Rutledge wants to
see you before you go.

01:15:43.824 --> 01:15:45.491
She's at the center table.

01:15:45.492 --> 01:15:47.323
Thank you both.

01:15:49.062 --> 01:15:50.863
Mr. Marlowe. Mrs. Rutle...

01:15:50.864 --> 01:15:52.656
Mrs. Rutledge wants to see me.

01:15:52.999 --> 01:15:54.799
- How did you know?
- He told me.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.002
She sure is picking them tonight.
Just won eight in a row.

01:15:58.003 --> 01:16:01.483
- I didn't hear him tell you anything.
- He didn't.

01:16:09.614 --> 01:16:12.682
What kind of game is this?
Go on. Spin the wheel.

01:16:12.683 --> 01:16:13.783
I want another play.

01:16:13.784 --> 01:16:16.152
I'm sorry. You have
more than $ 14,000 there.

01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:17.853
The table cannot cover your bet.

01:16:17.854 --> 01:16:19.555
Don't you want your money back?

01:16:19.556 --> 01:16:20.706
I sent for Mr. Mars.

01:16:20.757 --> 01:16:22.548
- Lady...
- Do you want to cover it?

01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:27.862
The lady.

01:16:27.863 --> 01:16:30.931
- Something the matter?
- I'd like one more play.

01:16:30.932 --> 01:16:32.842
All this on the red.

01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:34.972
Cover her bet in even thousands.

01:16:35.036 --> 01:16:38.639
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.540
Wish me luck, Marlowe.

01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.342
You wanted to see me.

01:16:42.343 --> 01:16:45.044
The people I came with want to stay...

01:16:45.045 --> 01:16:47.981
...so I thought maybe
you'd like to drive me home.

01:16:47.982 --> 01:16:50.249
- Sure.
- Are you ready, lady?

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:53.088
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- So am I.

01:17:07.932 --> 01:17:09.227
Number five, red!

01:17:14.438 --> 01:17:15.849
You did all right.

01:17:15.872 --> 01:17:20.124
I'll get my car while you collect,
and meet you outside.

01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:23.360
Cash me in.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.958
Good night.

01:18:51.925 --> 01:18:54.159
This is a gun, lady.
I want that money.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.142
Yell and I'll cut you in half.
Give me that bag!

01:18:59.698 --> 01:19:01.843
Hello, pal. Easy!

01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:05.269
Somebody's always giving me guns.

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.720
You can turn around now.

01:19:07.839 --> 01:19:12.968
I don't like people who play games.
Tell your boss...

01:19:13.578 --> 01:19:15.264
...when you wake up.

01:19:16.747 --> 01:19:18.042
Nice work.

01:19:18.081 --> 01:19:19.782
Are you my bodyguard now?

01:19:19.783 --> 01:19:21.117
Looks like it.

01:19:21.151 --> 01:19:22.943
You ready to go?

01:19:28.958 --> 01:19:32.227
Why are you trembling?
Don't tell me you were scared.

01:19:32.228 --> 01:19:34.595
I'm not used to being hijacked.
Give me time.

01:19:34.596 --> 01:19:37.064
Hijacked? Is that what it was?

01:19:37.065 --> 01:19:38.674
What else?

01:19:50.844 --> 01:19:53.111
You're still shaking.
What's the matter?

01:19:53.112 --> 01:19:56.548
You weren't worried about me?
Afraid I'd get hurt?

01:19:56.549 --> 01:19:59.532
When did you begin
to feel that way about me?

01:20:02.354 --> 01:20:04.221
Why are we stopping?

01:20:04.222 --> 01:20:06.328
To settle something.

01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:08.537
All right...

01:20:08.894 --> 01:20:11.261
...let's begin with
what Mars has on you.

01:20:11.262 --> 01:20:13.763
If he had, would it
be any of your business?

01:20:13.764 --> 01:20:15.365
You've already been paid.

01:20:15.366 --> 01:20:16.739
Yeah, by you.

01:20:16.767 --> 01:20:20.202
- Are you after more money?
- I guess you've got a right to ask.

01:20:20.203 --> 01:20:24.834
No, I've already been well-paid.
I've got another reason.

01:20:24.908 --> 01:20:27.237
You like my father, don't you?

01:20:27.377 --> 01:20:28.526
Why don't you stop?

01:20:28.844 --> 01:20:32.180
Remember I said I was beginning
to like another Sternwood?

01:20:32.181 --> 01:20:34.287
I wish you'd show it.

01:20:34.349 --> 01:20:36.795
That should be awful easy.

01:20:44.859 --> 01:20:46.571
I liked that.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.510
I'd like more.

01:20:54.967 --> 01:20:56.955
That's even better.

01:20:58.037 --> 01:20:59.332
All right.

01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:03.008
Now that's settled.
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

01:21:04.342 --> 01:21:06.677
- So that's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.

01:21:06.678 --> 01:21:09.346
Kissing you is all right.
I'd like to do more of it.

01:21:09.347 --> 01:21:11.648
But I want to find out
what Mars has on you.

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:14.584
- If you say that again...
- I'll keep saying it till I find out.

01:21:14.585 --> 01:21:17.253
I told Eddie Mars
I was coming up to see him.

01:21:17.254 --> 01:21:19.021
When I arrived, you were there.

01:21:19.022 --> 01:21:21.390
You two staged an act.
He let you win money...

01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:23.558
...and then sent a man
to take it away...

01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:26.358
...to prove there was
nothing between you.

01:21:26.863 --> 01:21:28.013
You're shaking again.

01:21:28.197 --> 01:21:31.032
- Take me home.
- Sure I will.

01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:32.766
But first, open that bag.

01:21:32.767 --> 01:21:36.036
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

01:21:36.037 --> 01:21:39.173
Make a sap out of me,
or else stop playing me for one.

01:21:39.174 --> 01:21:41.207
Take me home.

01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:43.743
All right, but that's as far
as I'll carry you.

01:21:43.744 --> 01:21:46.609
From now on, you can
take care of yourself.

01:21:56.823 --> 01:21:58.235
<i>Hello, Phil?</i>

01:21:58.258 --> 01:22:01.826
<i>- Hello, Bernie. What's up?
- I want to see you right away.</i>

01:22:01.827 --> 01:22:03.694
I haven't had breakfast.

01:22:03.695 --> 01:22:05.396
<i>It's 2:00.</i>

01:22:05.397 --> 01:22:08.832
<i>If you're not here in 30 minutes
you'll be eating on the county.</i>

01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:13.069
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:15.137
All right, I'll be there.

01:22:23.513 --> 01:22:26.548
Don't you know better than to wake
a man at 2 p.m.?

01:22:26.549 --> 01:22:28.694
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:30.919
You're to lay off the Sternwood case.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.187
- Who says so?
- The DA.

01:22:33.188 --> 01:22:35.098
The DA, huh?

01:22:37.158 --> 01:22:39.448
He must have changed his mind.

01:22:40.395 --> 01:22:42.863
- Who changed it for him?
- General Sternwood.

01:22:42.864 --> 01:22:44.498
Personally?

01:22:44.499 --> 01:22:47.867
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the general.

01:22:47.868 --> 01:22:50.772
He talked to the daughter,
Mrs. Rutledge.

01:22:51.605 --> 01:22:54.372
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

01:22:54.373 --> 01:22:57.842
There's no law says a man can't
work on a case without a client.

01:22:57.843 --> 01:22:59.060
Keep his hand in.

01:22:59.111 --> 01:23:01.479
I'm just supposed to
tell you to lay off.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.714
I know, you just work here.

01:23:03.715 --> 01:23:07.129
All right, you told me to lay off.

01:23:07.152 --> 01:23:09.353
I'm getting breakfast.
Want a cup of coffee?

01:23:09.354 --> 01:23:10.885
No, thanks.

01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:47.287
<i>- Sternwood residence.
- Hello, Norris? This is Marlowe.</i>

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:48.544
<i>Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...</i>

01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:51.256
I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

01:23:51.257 --> 01:23:53.626
<i>I don't think it
would be possible tonight.</i>

01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:56.495
<i>- Why not?
- I've been trying to call you.</i>

01:23:56.496 --> 01:23:59.297
<i>Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.</i>

01:23:59.298 --> 01:24:02.556
<i>If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.</i>

01:24:04.103 --> 01:24:05.837
Hey, sugar, you got a match?

01:24:05.838 --> 01:24:07.524
Sure thing.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.946
<i>Hello, Marlowe?</i>

01:24:12.076 --> 01:24:13.449
Thanks.

01:24:16.013 --> 01:24:17.613
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

01:24:17.614 --> 01:24:21.050
<i>I wanted to tell you
you can stop worrying...</i>

01:24:21.051 --> 01:24:23.819
<i>... and call off your bloodhounds.
We found Shawn.</i>

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.310
You found Shawn?

01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:28.356
<i>Yes. He's been in Mexico.
He hasn't been very well.</i>

01:24:28.357 --> 01:24:29.574
What happened?

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:32.694
<i>An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.</i>

01:24:32.695 --> 01:24:34.528
<i>I'm leaving at once to meet him.</i>

01:24:34.529 --> 01:24:35.980
I see.

01:24:35.997 --> 01:24:38.899
I suppose the general's quite pleased.

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.802
<i>We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.</i>

01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:44.070
Thanks for telling me.

01:24:44.071 --> 01:24:45.366
Have a nice trip.

01:24:45.406 --> 01:24:47.591
<i>I will. Goodbye.</i>

01:24:47.608 --> 01:24:49.139
Goodbye.

01:25:23.073 --> 01:25:24.407
Say, mister...

01:25:24.607 --> 01:25:25.757
...would you please...

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.260
This is just our way
of saying, "Lay off".

01:26:14.918 --> 01:26:17.019
You the guy that's been tailing me?

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.789
Yeah. My name's Jones.
Harry Jones.

01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:22.773
- I want to see you.
- Swell!

01:26:23.494 --> 01:26:25.627
Did you want to see
those guys jump me?

01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:28.113
I didn't care one way or the other.

01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:31.099
You could've yelled for help.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.350
A guy's playing a hand, I let him
play it. I'm no kibitzer.

01:26:35.971 --> 01:26:38.077
You got brains.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.403
Get my hat, will you?

01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.516
Help me up to my office.

01:27:01.527 --> 01:27:04.595
That working-over they gave you
was the best I've seen.

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:06.545
And I've been around too.

01:27:06.732 --> 01:27:08.566
Used to run a little liquor.

01:27:08.567 --> 01:27:11.301
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

01:27:11.302 --> 01:27:13.565
- Tough racket.
- Terrible!

01:27:13.905 --> 01:27:17.808
- Sit down. You make me nervous.
- Maybe you don't believe me.

01:27:17.809 --> 01:27:19.259
What do you want?

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:20.649
That's better.

01:27:20.677 --> 01:27:22.208
I'm selling something, cheap.

01:27:22.379 --> 01:27:23.713
For a couple of C's.

01:27:23.747 --> 01:27:25.539
Don't let me stop you.

01:27:25.549 --> 01:27:29.106
- Don't you want to even know who I am?
- I already know.

01:27:29.318 --> 01:27:30.351
You're not a cop.

01:27:30.352 --> 01:27:33.054
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

01:27:33.055 --> 01:27:35.490
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:37.491
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

01:27:37.492 --> 01:27:39.293
How'd you know that?

01:27:39.294 --> 01:27:42.663
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

01:27:42.664 --> 01:27:44.231
She's too big for you.

01:27:44.232 --> 01:27:46.560
That's a dirty crack, brother.

01:27:46.867 --> 01:27:49.012
I suppose you're right.

01:27:51.805 --> 01:27:54.945
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

01:27:55.209 --> 01:27:56.778
Cut the babble.
What is it?

01:27:57.009 --> 01:27:58.910
Will you pay for something?

01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:00.782
- If it what?
- Helps you find Regan.

01:28:02.048 --> 01:28:03.198
This is getting funny.

01:28:03.249 --> 01:28:07.017
I'm supposed to pay you two C's
for telling me I'm looking for Regan.

01:28:07.018 --> 01:28:08.986
People are always
telling me that.

01:28:08.987 --> 01:28:11.093
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

01:28:11.256 --> 01:28:13.123
Do you want to know what I've got?

01:28:13.124 --> 01:28:14.654
I don't know.

01:28:14.658 --> 01:28:17.961
200 buys a lot of
information in my circle.

01:28:17.962 --> 01:28:20.430
Would you pay it to know
where Mars' wife is?

01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:23.232
Would you pay $ 200 for that, shamus?

01:28:23.233 --> 01:28:25.025
I think I might.

01:28:25.034 --> 01:28:26.721
- Where?
- Agnes found her.

01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:30.539
She'll tell you when she has
the dough in her hand.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:34.375
- You might tell the cops for nothing.
- I ain't so brittle.

01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:36.364
Agnes must have something
I didn't see.

01:28:36.578 --> 01:28:38.446
I ain't tried to pull anything.

01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:41.381
I came here with a proposition.
Take it or leave it.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:43.316
One right guy to another.

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:47.354
You start waving cops at me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.689
I am.

01:28:48.789 --> 01:28:50.123
Okay, 200 it is.

01:28:50.423 --> 01:28:52.391
- Have you got the money?
- Where's Agnes?

01:28:52.392 --> 01:28:55.094
You know Puss Walgreen's office?
Fulwider Building?

01:28:55.095 --> 01:28:56.862
428 in the back?

01:28:56.863 --> 01:28:58.664
No, but I can find it.

01:28:58.665 --> 01:29:00.765
Can you meet me there
in an hour?

01:29:00.766 --> 01:29:02.734
- I guess so.
- You bring the dough.

01:29:02.735 --> 01:29:04.762
I'll take you to Agnes.

01:29:48.409 --> 01:29:51.208
Who are you?
What do you want?

01:29:56.082 --> 01:29:58.109
I wanted to see you.

01:30:00.787 --> 01:30:01.920
Who are you?

01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:05.022
I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

01:30:05.023 --> 01:30:06.593
Canino?

01:30:07.926 --> 01:30:11.162
Sure, I thought you would remember.

01:30:11.163 --> 01:30:12.196
What do you want?

01:30:12.197 --> 01:30:14.664
Why have you been following Marlowe?

01:30:14.665 --> 01:30:16.116
- Who says I've been?
- I do.

01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:19.936
That was a mistake, your mistake.
Eddie Mars don't like it.

01:30:19.937 --> 01:30:23.906
Sit down and quit stalling!
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

01:30:23.907 --> 01:30:27.443
All right, there's no harm telling.
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

01:30:27.444 --> 01:30:29.645
She has to leave town.
That takes dough.

01:30:29.646 --> 01:30:31.379
She tried to
get it through Marlowe.

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.081
Why would he pay?

01:30:33.082 --> 01:30:35.616
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody?

01:30:35.617 --> 01:30:37.885
The young Sternwood girl was there.

01:30:37.886 --> 01:30:39.573
But Marlowe didn't say that.

01:30:40.588 --> 01:30:43.423
Agnes figured it was carfare
when she got hold of him.

01:30:43.424 --> 01:30:45.325
- You get it?
- Sure, I get it.

01:30:45.326 --> 01:30:47.589
- Where's this Agnes?
- What do you care?

01:30:47.628 --> 01:30:49.829
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:51.164
What's the matter, Jones?

01:30:51.198 --> 01:30:53.997
Ain't you ever seen a gun?
Where's the girl?

01:30:54.368 --> 01:30:57.069
You want me to count three,
like a movie?

01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:58.782
Where's Agnes?

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:01.618
You win.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.375
She's in an apartment...

01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:05.482
...at 28 Court Street.

01:31:06.679 --> 01:31:08.666
Apartment 301.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:10.864
I guess I'm yellow.

01:31:11.082 --> 01:31:13.384
You just got good sense.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:17.518
I ain't gonna hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

01:31:17.788 --> 01:31:18.938
Nervous, ain't you?

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:21.858
- Maybe you need a drink.
- I don't think so...

01:31:21.859 --> 01:31:23.730
You got a glass?

01:31:26.162 --> 01:31:27.312
At the water cooler.

01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:45.673
There you are, pal.
Drink her down.

01:31:46.514 --> 01:31:47.664
Well, drink it!

01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:50.016
What do you think it is, poison?

01:31:50.017 --> 01:31:52.582
I bet that Agnes
wouldn't turn it down.

01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:55.304
No, I'll bet she wouldn't.

01:32:02.528 --> 01:32:04.215
What's funny?

01:32:05.764 --> 01:32:07.556
Nothing's funny.

01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:10.828
So long, Jonesy.

01:32:44.899 --> 01:32:49.235
Information, give me the number
of apartment 301, 28 Court Street.

01:32:49.236 --> 01:32:51.185
<i>Thank you. One moment, please.</i>

01:32:52.739 --> 01:32:56.908
<i>- Courtview Apartments.
- This is Police Identification Bureau.</i>

01:32:56.909 --> 01:32:59.778
You got a girl living there
named Agnes Lowzier?

01:32:59.779 --> 01:33:01.913
<i>Nobody by that name here.</i>

01:33:01.914 --> 01:33:04.716
Have you got a brunette with
green eyes...

01:33:04.717 --> 01:33:08.686
...either alone or with a little guy,
weighs about 115 pounds...

01:33:08.687 --> 01:33:10.921
...wears a gray hat and gray suit?

01:33:10.922 --> 01:33:13.329
<i>Sorry. Nothing like that.</i>

01:33:14.259 --> 01:33:17.293
Somebody just gave out
the wrong address.

01:33:17.294 --> 01:33:18.745
Thanks.

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:40.856
You did all right, Jonesy.

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:43.714
But you left me high and dry.

01:33:57.864 --> 01:33:58.998
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:33:58.999 --> 01:34:01.900
<i>- What did you say?
- I said, "Who is this?"</i>

01:34:01.901 --> 01:34:04.230
Hello, Agnes. This is Marlowe.

01:34:04.336 --> 01:34:06.137
Marlowe, the man you want to see.

01:34:06.138 --> 01:34:08.584
<i>Is Harry there?</i>

01:34:08.941 --> 01:34:10.040
Yeah, he's here.

01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:12.776
<i>- Put him on, will you?
- He can't talk to you.</i>

01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:15.537
<i>- Why?
- Because he's dead.</i>

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.160
Your little man died to keep
you out of trouble.

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:21.484
I got your money for you.
Do you want it?

01:34:21.485 --> 01:34:23.619
<i>- Yeah, I want it.
- Have you got a car?</i>

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:26.689
<i>- Where can I meet you?
- Rampart and Oakwood.</i>

01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:29.057
I'll be there in half an hour.

01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:49.668
What happened to Harry?

01:34:49.743 --> 01:34:53.046
There's no use going into that.
You don't really care anyway.

01:34:53.047 --> 01:34:56.081
Just put it down your little man
deserved something better.

01:34:56.082 --> 01:34:57.455
Here's your 200.

01:34:59.552 --> 01:35:02.888
Joe and I were riding on Foothill
Boulevard a couple of weeks ago.

01:35:02.889 --> 01:35:05.723
We passed a brown coupe and
I saw the driver.

01:35:05.724 --> 01:35:07.391
It was Eddie Mars' wife.

01:35:07.392 --> 01:35:09.994
- There was a fellow with her. Canino.
- I know him.

01:35:09.995 --> 01:35:13.297
<i>Some people you don't forget,
even if you've only seen them once.</i>

01:35:13.298 --> 01:35:16.900
We got curious and Joe tailed them.
Do you know where Realito is?

01:35:16.901 --> 01:35:19.469
About 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:22.072
Off the highway,
there's a garage and paint shop...

01:35:22.073 --> 01:35:23.289
...run by a guy named Huck.

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:26.775
Hot-car drop, likely.
And a frame house right behind it.

01:35:26.776 --> 01:35:28.346
That's where Mars' wife is.

01:35:28.411 --> 01:35:30.412
- You sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

01:35:30.413 --> 01:35:33.848
Art Huck's, 10 miles east of Realito.
Is that right?

01:35:33.849 --> 01:35:36.718
So long, copper. Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.

01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:39.440
Your kind always does.

01:37:45.433 --> 01:37:46.583
What do you want?

01:37:46.601 --> 01:37:49.335
Open up.
I got a flat on the highway.

01:37:49.336 --> 01:37:53.889
Sorry, mister, we're closed
for the night. Better try Realito.

01:38:04.751 --> 01:38:06.282
All right.

01:38:06.285 --> 01:38:08.115
Come on in.

01:38:10.355 --> 01:38:12.556
You'd scare off
a lot of trade with that.

01:38:12.557 --> 01:38:14.859
You can get yourself hurt
kicking on doors.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.010
Cut it out, Art.

01:38:16.128 --> 01:38:17.578
The guy's right.

01:38:17.595 --> 01:38:22.345
You run a garage, don't you?
Go ahead. Give him a hand.

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.473
Thanks, mister.

01:38:25.802 --> 01:38:27.703
I suppose you can fix flats?

01:38:27.704 --> 01:38:31.140
Good as you can make them,
but I'm working on a spray job.

01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:33.404
It's too damp
for a good spray job, Art.

01:38:33.643 --> 01:38:35.343
You got time to fix his tire.

01:38:35.344 --> 01:38:36.875
- But I don't...
- Get moving!

01:38:37.513 --> 01:38:38.691
Sure.

01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:40.615
Here's the key to the back.

01:38:40.616 --> 01:38:43.337
Put the spare on.
That'll make it easier.

01:38:47.822 --> 01:38:50.424
Yeah, I took a skid up at the corner.

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:54.527
A front tire went.
Lucky to find some help.

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:56.595
You live around here?

01:38:56.863 --> 01:38:59.506
Just drove in from Reno
and Carson City.

01:38:59.599 --> 01:39:02.895
Came the long way around, huh?
Business trip?

01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:04.620
Partly.

01:39:05.771 --> 01:39:07.505
Having your car painted?

01:39:07.506 --> 01:39:09.240
Just a spray job.

01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:12.654
Art's pretty slow.
He should've been finished by now.

01:39:13.745 --> 01:39:15.393
All right, Art.

01:39:15.413 --> 01:39:17.676
Take him in the house.

01:39:35.031 --> 01:39:37.019
You'd be Mrs. Eddie Mars...

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.334
...the blonde that was
supposed to run off with Regan.

01:39:40.335 --> 01:39:42.206
That's right.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.888
Hello, angel.

01:39:50.945 --> 01:39:54.425
Move that light, will you?
Or move me.

01:39:59.786 --> 01:40:02.507
I thought I'd find you here.

01:40:03.256 --> 01:40:05.691
I suppose we're in the house
back of the garage.

01:40:05.692 --> 01:40:08.020
Maybe you'd better stop talking.

01:40:10.929 --> 01:40:14.487
The boys don't take
any chances, do they?

01:40:15.133 --> 01:40:16.702
Where are they?

01:40:17.368 --> 01:40:19.369
Out digging a grave?

01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:21.838
You had to go on
with this, didn't you?

01:40:21.839 --> 01:40:22.989
Where are they?

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.574
They've gone down
the road to telephone.

01:40:25.575 --> 01:40:29.252
Call up Eddie Mars,
find out what to do with me.

01:40:29.279 --> 01:40:30.810
I could tell them that.

01:40:30.814 --> 01:40:33.015
Why did you have to go on?

01:40:33.016 --> 01:40:35.775
Too many people told me to stop.

01:40:36.719 --> 01:40:38.987
Light me a cigarette,
will you, angel?

01:40:38.988 --> 01:40:40.400
Why'd you make trouble?

01:40:40.823 --> 01:40:42.490
Eddie never did you any harm.

01:40:42.491 --> 01:40:45.025
I wasn't in love with Shawn.
We were friends.

01:40:45.026 --> 01:40:47.027
If I hadn't hidden
when Shawn disappeared...

01:40:47.028 --> 01:40:48.996
...the cops would've been sure
he killed him.

01:40:48.997 --> 01:40:50.409
Maybe he did kill him.

01:40:50.431 --> 01:40:51.726
Eddie's not that kind.

01:40:51.766 --> 01:40:54.634
- You mean Eddie never kills anybody.
- No.

01:40:54.635 --> 01:40:57.081
You really believe that, don't you?

01:40:57.437 --> 01:41:00.206
How do you suppose
I found out you were here?

01:41:00.207 --> 01:41:02.440
Little man named Jones told me.

01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:04.876
Funny little guy. Harmless.
I liked him.

01:41:04.877 --> 01:41:09.114
Came to sell me the information
because I was working for Sternwood.

01:41:09.115 --> 01:41:11.782
How he came to know,
it's a long story.

01:41:11.783 --> 01:41:14.385
Canino, your husband's man,
got to him first...

01:41:14.386 --> 01:41:16.587
...while I stood around like a sap.

01:41:16.588 --> 01:41:18.322
I was in the next room.

01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:21.736
Now the little man is dead.
But Eddie didn't do that, did he?

01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:24.427
He never kills anybody,
he just hires it done.

01:41:24.428 --> 01:41:25.606
You're lying!

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:27.964
You think he's just
a gambler, don't you?

01:41:27.965 --> 01:41:30.566
I think he's a blackmailer,
a hot-car broker...

01:41:30.567 --> 01:41:32.176
...a killer by remote control.

01:41:32.402 --> 01:41:36.118
Anything with money pinned to it,
anything rotten...

01:41:38.674 --> 01:41:40.937
Ask him when you see him.

01:41:43.345 --> 01:41:45.613
Well, we got rid of her.

01:41:45.614 --> 01:41:47.447
She's all right.
I like her.

01:41:47.448 --> 01:41:49.549
You like too many people.

01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:53.687
- I wonder if you'd do that for a man.
- None that I've ever met.

01:41:53.688 --> 01:41:57.056
Then there's nothing to do
but wait till Canino gets back.

01:41:57.057 --> 01:41:58.958
He doesn't know
I was there.

01:41:58.959 --> 01:42:01.824
You know what he'll do
when he finds out, don't you?

01:42:01.828 --> 01:42:04.863
Beat my teeth out then kick me
in my stomach for mumbling.

01:42:04.864 --> 01:42:07.532
- That'll be just the start...
- Stop talking that way!

01:42:07.533 --> 01:42:09.634
You should have gone to Mexico.

01:42:09.635 --> 01:42:12.203
- But then you couldn't, could you?
- Stop it.

01:42:12.204 --> 01:42:14.838
Border patrol would have
checked you through alone.

01:42:14.839 --> 01:42:17.107
People would have
seen you without Regan.

01:42:17.108 --> 01:42:21.124
It was safer for you to come here,
especially for Eddie.

01:42:21.446 --> 01:42:23.713
Will you stay out of this
if I let you go?

01:42:23.714 --> 01:42:25.048
No.

01:42:25.949 --> 01:42:27.780
Take this thing out of my mouth.

01:42:43.765 --> 01:42:45.675
That's better.

01:42:46.167 --> 01:42:47.959
Get a knife and cut these ropes.

01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:02.044
Watch your fingers.

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:09.725
Don't cut toward your hand.

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:15.826
- Who's got a key to these handcuffs?
- Canino.

01:43:15.827 --> 01:43:17.395
I don't suppose
there's a gun around?

01:43:17.396 --> 01:43:19.461
None that I know of.

01:43:29.205 --> 01:43:31.690
The boys made a fast trip.

01:43:32.242 --> 01:43:33.929
What can you do?

01:43:35.412 --> 01:43:38.479
Look, angel. I'm gonna
leave you in a tough spot.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.514
That's all right.

01:43:39.515 --> 01:43:42.350
- How do I get out of here?
- That door leads to a porch.

01:43:42.351 --> 01:43:44.485
As soon as I've gone,
you count to 20.

01:43:44.486 --> 01:43:46.395
- Then scream your head off.
- I will.

01:43:47.355 --> 01:43:49.840
All right. Start counting.

01:44:20.385 --> 01:44:23.027
Get going, Art.
You heard what I said!

01:45:43.425 --> 01:45:45.412
There! Behind the wheel!

01:45:47.762 --> 01:45:49.057
Over here, Canino!

01:46:07.246 --> 01:46:08.424
Here.

01:46:08.481 --> 01:46:10.744
That looks like the key.

01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:17.115
We'll have to take his car.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:32.401
How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

01:46:32.402 --> 01:46:34.926
About eight or 10 miles to Realito.
Why?

01:46:35.071 --> 01:46:38.574
When Eddie's wife fixes my car
and he finds out what happened...

01:46:38.575 --> 01:46:39.724
...there'll be trouble.

01:46:39.942 --> 01:46:42.109
You'll be in it
just as much as I will.

01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:44.216
I don't mind,
as long as you're around.

01:46:46.415 --> 01:46:49.349
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for what you did.

01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.142
You looked good. Awful good!

01:46:51.552 --> 01:46:54.421
I didn't know they made them
like that anymore.

01:46:54.422 --> 01:46:55.914
I guess I'm in love with you.

01:46:59.292 --> 01:47:01.393
Will you go to the police with me?

01:47:01.394 --> 01:47:02.728
I can't.

01:47:02.762 --> 01:47:04.174
Why not?

01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:07.532
What if I told you
I killed Shawn Regan?

01:47:07.533 --> 01:47:09.678
Would you tell the police that?

01:47:10.469 --> 01:47:12.732
I will if you take me there.

01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:16.340
I'm not going to.

01:47:16.341 --> 01:47:18.748
Look, angel, I'm tired.

01:47:18.877 --> 01:47:21.612
My jaw hurts, my ribs ache,
I killed a man back there...

01:47:21.613 --> 01:47:24.648
...and stood by while
a harmless guy was killed.

01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:26.021
I can't say it all happened...

01:47:26.049 --> 01:47:28.751
...because Geiger tried to throw
a loop over Carmen.

01:47:28.752 --> 01:47:30.283
They'll swarm your house...

01:47:30.287 --> 01:47:32.588
...so fast that every closet
in your family...

01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:36.068
...will look like a police convention.

01:47:36.325 --> 01:47:38.193
They'll all ask the same question...

01:47:38.194 --> 01:47:39.725
..."Where's Shawn Regan?

01:47:39.729 --> 01:47:42.731
Why did Mars hide his wife so
it looked like she ran off with Regan?"

01:47:42.732 --> 01:47:46.200
Why did you hide out there?
You're playing with dynamite.

01:47:46.201 --> 01:47:48.702
- If I...
- I won't ask any more questions.

01:47:48.703 --> 01:47:51.505
I won't even ask you
how you got into this mess.

01:47:51.506 --> 01:47:53.740
I'll ask Eddie,
if I can get there quickly.

01:47:53.741 --> 01:47:55.768
Why are you doing that?

01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:58.734
I guess I'm in love with you.

01:48:41.684 --> 01:48:44.208
Hello. Let me talk to Mr. Mars.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.760
Hello, Eddie.
This is Marlowe.

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:49.957
Yeah, Marlowe,
or what's left of him.

01:48:49.958 --> 01:48:52.225
That Canino's a pretty good boy.

01:48:52.226 --> 01:48:55.170
You'll have trouble getting
another as good.

01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:57.953
What's the matter, Eddie?
Can't you talk?

01:48:58.265 --> 01:49:00.967
I'm in Realito, the same
place Canino called from.

01:49:00.968 --> 01:49:03.002
Only now it's me that's calling.

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.913
I want to see you.

01:49:06.005 --> 01:49:09.741
Why don't you go to the police?
I just killed your best boy.

01:49:09.742 --> 01:49:12.266
Do you want to see me
or don't you?

01:49:12.745 --> 01:49:13.923
All right. Where?

01:49:15.613 --> 01:49:19.368
Las Olindas is too far.
Not your apartment either.

01:49:20.218 --> 01:49:21.368
Your house?

01:49:21.519 --> 01:49:24.161
You mean the one
that Geiger lived in?

01:49:24.822 --> 01:49:26.771
All right. When?

01:49:28.025 --> 01:49:30.354
How long will it take me
to get there?

01:49:31.595 --> 01:49:34.079
I'll be there just as quick as I can.

01:49:35.832 --> 01:49:37.933
- It worked.
- You're taking an awful chance.

01:49:37.934 --> 01:49:40.224
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

01:49:41.371 --> 01:49:44.205
Go and make sure
that back door is locked...

01:49:44.206 --> 01:49:47.581
...and then close these curtains.
I'll get rid of the car.

01:49:58.686 --> 01:50:01.209
You're the one who's shaking now.

01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:03.599
I'm scared, angel.

01:50:03.823 --> 01:50:05.850
I'm sore too.

01:50:06.092 --> 01:50:09.294
Mars has been ahead of me
all the way. Way ahead!

01:50:09.295 --> 01:50:13.088
If I don't get the jump on him
this time, we're cooked.

01:50:25.843 --> 01:50:27.596
Here they are.

01:50:30.814 --> 01:50:32.345
Watch the back.

01:50:32.349 --> 01:50:35.685
If you see anybody coming,
yell like you did before.

01:50:49.164 --> 01:50:51.388
- What?
- The curtain! Stop it swinging.

01:51:40.843 --> 01:51:43.311
I got here first.
Put those scissors down.

01:51:43.312 --> 01:51:44.999
Put them down!

01:51:48.617 --> 01:51:50.408
Turn around.

01:51:58.059 --> 01:51:59.667
Over there.

01:52:08.601 --> 01:52:10.171
Sit down.

01:52:13.139 --> 01:52:15.206
There's two men out in back.

01:52:15.207 --> 01:52:17.574
- Watch them.
- Hello, Mr. Mars.

01:52:17.575 --> 01:52:20.296
- You double-crossing...
- I told you to sit down.

01:52:23.448 --> 01:52:25.949
And leave her out of it.
She's all right.

01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:28.751
She kept her deal.
She didn't tell me a thing...

01:52:28.752 --> 01:52:31.387
...except that she killed Regan.
I didn't believe that.

01:52:31.388 --> 01:52:33.890
Regan's dead,
but she didn't do it.

01:52:33.891 --> 01:52:36.324
It was Carmen, wasn't it?
How'd it happen?

01:52:36.325 --> 01:52:38.960
- She didn't tell...?
- I asked you how it happened.

01:52:38.961 --> 01:52:42.097
- Carmen liked Regan.
- But he liked your wife.

01:52:42.098 --> 01:52:43.899
He said no to Carmen.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:47.468
She gets mad when anybody says that.
I've seen her that way.

01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:51.071
She was high. When it was over,
she couldn't remember much about it.

01:52:51.072 --> 01:52:52.681
I've seen her that way too.

01:52:52.908 --> 01:52:55.074
- You hid the body.
- You can't prove it.

01:52:55.075 --> 01:52:57.544
It's just as bad for you
if I prove it to myself.

01:52:57.545 --> 01:52:59.345
Then you blackmailed
Mrs. Rutledge...

01:52:59.346 --> 01:53:01.681
...by telling her
what Carmen had done.

01:53:01.682 --> 01:53:04.183
How did you prove to her
that Carmen had done it?

01:53:04.184 --> 01:53:05.635
Prove it to me.

01:53:05.652 --> 01:53:07.103
You've seen her when she's that way.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.187
Sure I have. Have you?

01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:12.232
Why didn't you know her
when you walked in here?

01:53:12.391 --> 01:53:16.028
You're pretty smart,
but I've been waiting for this one.

01:53:17.429 --> 01:53:18.579
What are you gonna do?

01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:21.098
I said you're smart.
You walked in without a gun.

01:53:21.099 --> 01:53:23.700
You'd agree to everything,
just like you're doing now.

01:53:23.701 --> 01:53:25.669
When I left,
things would be different.

01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:28.305
That's what those boys
are doing out there.

01:53:28.306 --> 01:53:31.040
But everything's changed now,
since I got here first.

01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:32.675
Angel, get on the floor!

01:53:32.676 --> 01:53:34.543
Don't get excited, Marlowe.

01:53:34.544 --> 01:53:37.746
If anything happens, if there's
any shooting, you'll just...

01:53:37.747 --> 01:53:40.949
What do you think will happen now?
What'll your boys think?

01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:43.685
What'll they do to
the first one out that door?

01:53:43.686 --> 01:53:45.217
Who's it gonna be, you or me?

01:53:45.221 --> 01:53:47.255
- Now look...
- You look at this!

01:53:47.256 --> 01:53:49.165
Haven't you ever seen a gun?

01:53:49.457 --> 01:53:51.558
Want me to count,
like in the movies?

01:53:51.559 --> 01:53:53.193
That's what Canino said to Jonesy.

01:53:53.194 --> 01:53:55.562
- Don't go crazy!
- Jonesy took it better.

01:53:55.897 --> 01:53:58.081
- That's one, Eddie.
- Don't! Don't!

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.636
That's two, Eddie!

01:54:01.235 --> 01:54:03.341
Don't shoot! It's me, Mars!

01:54:47.009 --> 01:54:48.265
Bernie?

01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:50.141
This is Marlowe.

01:54:50.512 --> 01:54:52.546
I've got some more red points for you.

01:54:52.547 --> 01:54:55.215
<i>- Who is it this time?
- Eddie Mars.</i>

01:54:55.216 --> 01:54:56.816
His boys got him.

01:54:56.817 --> 01:54:59.586
There's more to it than that.
He killed Regan.

01:54:59.587 --> 01:55:01.038
I'll tell you when I see you.

01:55:01.055 --> 01:55:02.231
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:55:02.289 --> 01:55:06.125
The same place, Laverne Terrace.
Come up and get me out of here.

01:55:06.126 --> 01:55:08.761
And watch yourself.
They may still be outside.

01:55:08.762 --> 01:55:10.332
<i>Right away.</i>

01:55:18.437 --> 01:55:20.004
It won't take him long.

01:55:20.005 --> 01:55:22.607
Wait a minute, let me do the talking.

01:55:22.874 --> 01:55:27.322
I don't know what I'll tell him,
but it'll be pretty close to the truth.

01:55:27.712 --> 01:55:29.812
You'll have to send Carmen away...

01:55:29.813 --> 01:55:31.514
...from a lot of things.

01:55:31.515 --> 01:55:33.621
They have places for that.

01:55:33.817 --> 01:55:36.957
Maybe they can cure her.
It's been done before.

01:55:37.487 --> 01:55:41.581
We'll have to tell your father
about Regan. I think he can take it.

01:55:41.724 --> 01:55:44.014
You've forgotten one thing.

01:55:44.493 --> 01:55:45.749
Me.

01:55:49.297 --> 01:55:51.168
What's wrong with you?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.485
Nothing you can't fix.
