06:18.140 --> 06:21.660
It was a mistake. Can't we
just work something out here?

06:21.940 --> 06:24.180
Mistake or no mistake, you
just destroyed private property.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.820
And from the smell of your breath,
I suggest you take the ticket.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.460
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.540
I don't know, I thought
you'd take you home.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.100
Touching an officers uniform
is considered an assault?

06:33.940 --> 06:35.540
Were you aware of that?

06:35.780 --> 06:37.180
You look pretty hot in tan.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.380
It's not tan, it's beige!

06:43.580 --> 06:44.940
Hey, take it easy!

06:45.140 --> 06:48.460
Another step and you'll pissing
lightning bolts into next week, ok?

07:05.980 --> 07:08.020
Pretty much your average day in college

07:08.980 --> 07:12.140
Hey Kelly, I wasn't sure you'd
be coming back for spring break.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.700
Yeah, I'm here

07:15.740 --> 07:18.140
I can only assume you're down
here to get on one of those boats

07:18.420 --> 07:21.860
No, I came down here to pick up
my little sister for music lessons.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.140
What about yourself?

07:23.940 --> 07:27.460
I'm just waiting for my ride. Todd and his
friends, we're gonna go check out some music.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.380
Todd Dupree?

07:29.980 --> 07:31.580
Remind me who you're
going out with again?

07:32.180 --> 07:34.260
You gotta have standards
ok, thats all I'm saying

07:35.740 --> 07:37.340
Todd's a really good DJ.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.580
Kelly! Let's go. Jump in we're late.

07:45.660 --> 07:49.140
He says he's got backstage passes
for Planners, you should come.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.620
I would, but I'm pretty much under
house arrest with Shing Tsing and Laura.

07:52.820 --> 07:53.900
Too bad

07:55.300 --> 07:56.420
We'll miss you.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.020
I gotta go.
- Come on, we gotta go!

07:59.620 --> 08:03.260
I hope to see you before...

08:04.060 --> 08:05.340
... before you leave.
Pretty smooth Jake.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.180
Hey asswipe! Cool shirt!

08:20.260 --> 08:22.260
Nice horn. Thanks

08:22.980 --> 08:24.620
Nice boobs

08:25.460 --> 08:26.340
Thanks

08:26.580 --> 08:30.100
I have a training bra but I
don't like to wear it, it itches.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.500
Tell me about it.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.820
Who are you waiting for?

08:35.059 --> 08:36.700
My brother Jake. He's 17.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.179
And he'll like your boobs too.
- They all do.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.700
Come on, let's go.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.980
What happened to you?

08:42.220 --> 08:44.100
I don't want to talk
about it, ok. Let's go.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.300
Hi Jake.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.580
Try to not stare at her boobs.

08:47.900 --> 08:48.900
Shut up.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.380
I like your shirt.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.180
Why? You wanna throw
something at me too?

08:53.780 --> 08:55.820
No, actually I like The Pixies.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.820
Danni, Danni, Danni,
where the hell is Crystal?

08:58.020 --> 08:59.140
She's over there with Andrew.

08:59.180 --> 09:01.540
She went to buy sunscreen.

09:01.660 --> 09:02.500
Sunscreen?

09:02.540 --> 09:04.380
Andrew, Crystal, we
don't need sunscreen.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.060
We need body paint,
condoms. We need Ready Whip

09:06.260 --> 09:11.740
Tell her to come tomorrow I want bleach blonde booty
at the marina. I gotta get my first shot off by noon.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.580
Make sure those titties
are nice and perky!

09:16.860 --> 09:17.660
Who's this?

09:17.940 --> 09:20.940
This is Jake. He's a local.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.180
Sandrat huh? You know your
way around the lake? -Yes.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.700
You wanna job? I'll pay you cash.

09:27.420 --> 09:28.460
No bullshit Jake.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.780
My guide didn't show
and I need somebody asap.

09:31.180 --> 09:34.700
I need someone with ambition, someone
who is willing to take chances...

09:34.900 --> 09:36.740
... If, you, know, what, I, mean.

09:37.020 --> 09:39.140
Sir, you talk funny.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
Yeah, well, you're short! Hold on,
- This is Derick

09:45.460 --> 09:47.940
Don't you disappoint me
motherfucker. I told you!

09:48.180 --> 09:51.180
I want the biggest Goddam boat
this podunk town has to offer

09:51.420 --> 09:52.580
Who is that?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.100
Derick? He's the director.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.660
So you're like a, er.. actress or what?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.820
I am a 'Wild Wild Girl'.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.740
What's a 'Wild Wild Girl', Jake?

10:06.460 --> 10:09.620
Of course we know boats! Fuck
the waiver! You signed the waiver!

10:09.980 --> 10:11.140
So, Jake baby, are we gonna do this?

10:11.900 --> 10:14.700
Do what?
- The job! Location scout! Get us around, show us the spots...

10:14.940 --> 10:17.780
the G-spots. I need a local.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.380
I need you.

10:20.980 --> 10:22.540
We're talking about
life lesson here Jake.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.380
Great, 10am, tomorrow. Don't be late.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.940
And... wear a different shirt

10:29.540 --> 10:31.140
I we'll see you tomorrow Jake.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.220
Actually, tomorrow he's...

11:06.180 --> 11:08.340
-Jake Why'd you bother to knock, if
you're just gonna walk straight in?

11:08.580 --> 11:09.980
Am I disturbing you?

11:10.540 --> 11:15.340
No, I'm just doing homework,
and stuff for school.

11:18.540 --> 11:22.100
Laura has been telling me that you
may have some other plans for tomorrow

11:22.500 --> 11:24.900
I don't know what she's talking
about. I'm 100% baby-sitting.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.300
What? No, we don't want babysitter.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.580
Yeah mum. Especially not Jake.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.220
I'm serious, mum, we dont need one.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.060
Out, out, out.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.780
Jake, you know I don't have a backup.

11:42.180 --> 11:45.580
I know mum. Don't worry, you know
how crazy this week is for you.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.300
And dont worry, I'll take
care of the nitwits, ok?

11:48.740 --> 11:52.620
Remember, if you do not fulfill their
responsibilities, I have power to arrest

11:52.900 --> 11:54.580
and imprison you.

11:54.860 --> 11:57.940
Mum, I'm not 12. playing on
the sheriff card doesn't work.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.460
No?
- No!

12:00.860 --> 12:02.500
As I said, I'll take care of them, ok?

12:03.900 --> 12:05.180
OK.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.700
Now get outta here -I promise next
year I'll try to find another solution.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.020
OK?
- Ok.

12:19.980 --> 12:21.860
Oh and Jake. -Come on Mum! Really?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.060
It's time for dinner.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.940
OK, alright, I'll be right there.

12:52.540 --> 12:53.820
Hope I didn't wake the kids?

12:54.060 --> 12:55.740
They'll sleep through anything.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.940
So, Maggy said yesterday was
the last time she saw him?

12:59.180 --> 13:00.500
Yeah, just before midnight.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.980
She said Matt took a
boat to catch some bass.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.460
She drove around the lake
all night looking for him.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.340
Where's the boat?.
- Over there.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.540
Feeling like a skinny dip?

13:22.540 --> 13:24.940
Yeah, if we can make it
to the end of the pier

13:25.340 --> 13:27.220
You mean I'm to old, or too heavy?

13:27.300 --> 13:28.420
I think you're too chicken-shit!

13:31.900 --> 13:33.780
By the way, Gordon called last night.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.060
Yeah?

13:35.180 --> 13:38.940
He said that U.S.G.S. recorded heavy
seismic activity below the lake.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.220
Really?

13:40.460 --> 13:42.900
Yeah, they're sending in a
team of seismologist divers

13:44.300 --> 13:47.180
And he told them that
you're gonna escort them out!

13:47.500 --> 13:48.740
Jesus Christ.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.940
We've just been invaded by 20,000 kids

13:51.220 --> 13:52.940
makes us a little busy at the moment.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.260
I know. That's what I told him

13:56.260 --> 13:58.020
This doesnt sound too good

14:13.780 --> 14:16.060
So, what time are the
divers gonna get here?

14:16.380 --> 14:17.660
He said around 10.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.020
Shit.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.540
Come on, just a little more.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.420
I can't get it

14:48.920 --> 14:50.920
Jules!

14:54.420 --> 14:55.620
Give me your hand!

15:03.620 --> 15:05.460
Do you think a propeller
could've done this?

15:05.740 --> 15:07.500
I doubt it. Look at the
bones. Nothing broken

15:07.820 --> 15:11.540
It looks like toxic,
are acidic decomposition

15:11.860 --> 15:13.780
it's as it this body has
been in the water for weeks

15:15.460 --> 15:18.540
What would you say if I told that
I'm thinking about closing the lake?

15:19.540 --> 15:23.500
...at least until we get an autopsy report
- An autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days

15:24.780 --> 15:26.860
It'd be easier to drain
this lake, than close it.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.260
I's a big financial week for this town.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.400
I'm gettin too old for this

16:38.740 --> 16:41.260
We're not liying to mum.
- Yeah, we won't lie to mum.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.820
Come on guys, every year it's
the same. I'm stuck here with you

16:45.020 --> 16:46.300
and miss all the spring break fun.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.620
You mean spring break boobies!

16:48.820 --> 16:50.500
What if I give you guys the
cash for the baby-sitting?

16:50.740 --> 16:51.860
Sixty bucks and you gotta deal.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.580
Sixty? But I'm only getting paid forty.

16:53.860 --> 16:55.820
Twenty dollar deception surcharge!

17:01.460 --> 17:04.099
Don't pick up the phone,
don't answer the door

17:04.339 --> 17:05.900
and don't leave the house.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.460
OK? I'm counting on you guys.

17:08.780 --> 17:09.780
Alright?

17:22.380 --> 17:24.380
Town rules son. You throw a peice of trash
in the lake, you gotta pick up 10 peices

17:40.980 --> 17:45.020
After the dive, our presence is requested at
'Cocomos' The Arizona State cheerleading team.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.740
Hi, I'm Sheriff Forester.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.820
Bob Gordon asked me to
take you out to the site.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.220
It's nice to have a welcoming
committee around here

17:51.340 --> 17:53.140
I assume that's technical equipment too?

17:53.580 --> 17:54.820
Yeah, Sam, give them back.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.260
According to the epicenter coordinates

17:59.380 --> 18:00.980
we need to go here.

18:02.260 --> 18:04.900
Ok, that's about 20 minutes out

18:05.660 --> 18:06.780
Ready when you are. -Alright

18:11.180 --> 18:14.260
You dont see many women working Law
Enforcement out here in cowboy country.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.980
You dont see a lot of cowboys though

19:48.700 --> 19:49.620
Kelly.

19:50.100 --> 19:50.700
Jake.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.500
Who exactly are you baby-sitting here?

19:55.580 --> 19:58.140
This is a funny story actually.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.580
Wow. Look at those idiots.

20:05.980 --> 20:07.020
Yeah, it's terrible.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.700
Sandrat! Hey Sandrat,
I'm talking to you.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.700
Where the hell have you been?
We've got the girls lubed up

20:14.940 --> 20:17.060
We're ready to roll. I'm
docking your paycheck!

20:17.300 --> 20:18.500
Let's go.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.220
Now I see what you've been
scouting last 15 minutes.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.260
Kelly, it was great to see you,
I know you gotta get going...

20:28.540 --> 20:30.060
Hi Kelly, I'm Derick Jones.

20:30.780 --> 20:31.540
Hi

20:32.500 --> 20:33.380
You know this guy?

20:34.380 --> 20:36.300
Jake? Jake is my boy!

20:36.540 --> 20:39.500
He's the man with the plan!
The insight, the knowledge!

20:40.340 --> 20:43.740
Great. Those girls, they
aren't with you are they?

20:44.420 --> 20:46.300
Yes, why? Are you into girls?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.940
No, I'm just showing him around town.
All the hotspots, stuff like that.

20:50.820 --> 20:54.820
The job is called location scout,
and Kelly you should come with us.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.260
Today we're gonna be
making movie history.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.420
No, she's got other plans already.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.660
Kelly do you like champagne?

21:05.740 --> 21:09.940
I love champagne, actually I love...

21:10.820 --> 21:12.380
I would love to come on
your boat Derek, thanks.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.220
Come on, let me...
let me help you aboard.

21:25.860 --> 21:29.940
Hey Kelly baby. What happened
to hanging with us today?

21:30.180 --> 21:32.460
Who's that guy? Is he your boyfriend or something?
- No, he's just a boy from school...

21:32.700 --> 21:35.660
...who said he has back-stage
passes, when actually, he doesn't!

21:37.060 --> 21:38.660
Come on Kelly!

21:38.900 --> 21:40.140
T-shirts for you.

21:43.860 --> 21:44.860
What the fuck.

21:45.080 --> 21:45.960
That was Derick Jones!

21:46.180 --> 21:47.460
Is that Jake Forester?

22:00.060 --> 22:05.500
See you at 4 in wet t-shirt contest.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.460
Dave, we have to talk about this

22:09.700 --> 22:11.020
We told Jake that
we'd stay at the house.

22:11.820 --> 22:13.460
I told him that I would fish.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.460
I can't if there are no fish.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.060
The lake's too busy.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.420
Come on. Sand Island is really close

22:30.700 --> 22:32.180
I should've brought my trombone.

22:32.540 --> 22:36.220
No way! "Be a girl and
sunbathe or something!

22:37.340 --> 22:40.780
When I become a rock star, just
see if I let YOU be in my group!

22:41.540 --> 22:43.140
Give me a break!

22:43.460 --> 22:45.700
You play the trombone!

22:57.340 --> 23:04.100
Here we go ladies... a little Champagne...
- Thanks... the finest your gas station has to offer

23:09.420 --> 23:12.180
Cheers!

23:12.380 --> 23:14.500
to our newest 'Wild Wild Girl'

23:17.940 --> 23:20.460
That's why we came here. Derick
wants to capture innocence.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.380
It's all about innocence

23:22.580 --> 23:24.060
Just like her.

23:29.900 --> 23:33.980
Don't worry. Derick's just making his play.
You might as well ask him not to breathe

23:34.180 --> 23:37.460
It's the rules. Show a girl
a camera and she WILL perform.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.140
It's like a law of physics.

23:39.420 --> 23:41.260
I've seen that guy charm the
pants off a lot of ladies.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.260
She's not messing up your party is she?

23:45.060 --> 23:46.260
What do I care. She's not my girlfriend.

23:47.540 --> 23:50.380
This is great. I'm having a great time.

23:50.660 --> 23:53.740
We're going wild, I'm going wild.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.660
Hey, Jake. How far is
this place? Come on!

23:57.020 --> 23:58.860
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there

24:00.540 --> 24:02.380
Speaking of going wild...

24:03.340 --> 24:05.580
you haven't seen anything yet!

24:41.620 --> 24:43.820
Why not join us?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.900
Hey, what's up guys?
- Close that door, you're ruining our shot!

25:52.180 --> 25:54.500
Come on Sandrat. Get with the program.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.980
Here they come, here they
come. Here come my nymphs.

26:00.140 --> 26:01.420
Oh my God!

26:03.940 --> 26:06.260
Check it out! The fish, with boobies

26:07.780 --> 26:10.060
If all fish look like
that, I would fuck fish!

26:13.020 --> 26:15.380
Looking good ladies. You
like this, right Jake?

26:15.620 --> 26:18.020
You should be paying us today,
not the other way around!

26:24.380 --> 26:27.300
Look at these goddess aquatic
bitches. This is hot Andy!

26:27.500 --> 26:29.100
This is so hot. This
is what it's all about

26:29.860 --> 26:33.300
Beer, sun and naked hunnies
making out under water!

26:44.700 --> 26:48.380
Mum, what's going on there?

26:50.980 --> 26:52.940
How come you didn't
pick up the home phone?

26:53.300 --> 26:54.620
I've been trying to reach you.

26:57.020 --> 27:00.980
I was outside. I can go and
get it if you need me to.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.700
No, that's okay.

27:06.540 --> 27:07.540
Oh my God!

27:07.860 --> 27:08.780
What?

27:10.620 --> 27:13.980
Nothing, just kids.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.860
They're outside fishing...

27:18.980 --> 27:20.140
... and it's really nice to see them...

27:21.020 --> 27:22.300
... playing with each other.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.980
Put your ass on the glass!

27:26.940 --> 27:28.580
Jake is someone there with you?

27:31.700 --> 27:32.860
No, no, no. Just the kids on the lake.

27:33.060 --> 27:35.340
It's crazy here. You know how it is.

27:35.620 --> 27:38.940
Honey, I don't want Zane or Laura
near the lake today, you hear me?

27:39.980 --> 27:43.900
OK, we will stay home
and we'll watch TV.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.500
OK, I gotta go. Thank
you so much for this

27:48.420 --> 27:50.260
I'll try to come home early, ok?

27:51.340 --> 27:53.260
Ok, ok. I love you. I gotta go.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.700
Kelly?

28:01.540 --> 28:03.140
Kelly, where are you?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.140
Kelly?

28:57.980 --> 29:01.220
Jake, you missed the rest of the show.

29:02.660 --> 29:04.780
Let's go. Towels for the girls.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.260
Wow! Great! good work.
Way to tie up a canoe

29:13.780 --> 29:17.780
I must've gotten my knots mixed up.

29:17.860 --> 29:18.180
So you catch zero fish, and lose us our only
boat. Today is just full of accomplishments

29:18.260 --> 29:19.340
Jake's gonna kill us.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.060
Somebody will see us. See,
there are some boats over there.

29:23.780 --> 29:27.220
Don't waste your time. They'll
never see us, it's way too far.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.020
Hello!

29:36.580 --> 29:38.020
Hello!

29:54.180 --> 29:55.620
We need help!

29:57.020 --> 29:58.300
We're over here!

29:59.540 --> 30:01.180
Help us, somebody.

30:05.260 --> 30:06.940
We're over here, help!

31:02.980 --> 31:04.380
Woah! Look at the size of that!

31:04.700 --> 31:06.580
What is it? A cavern system?

31:07.540 --> 31:10.060
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.980
You see this gap here? -Yes.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.820
The quake opened that up,
now it's a connecting passage.

31:17.540 --> 31:18.620
A lake under a lake?

31:18.780 --> 31:20.860
That's right. I'm afraid
it's still your jurisdiction.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.820
This is part of an old volcanic
ridge all over this area.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.580
That's the beauty of it.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.620
We're gonna be the
first ones to explore it.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.180
I don't know why you get
s o excited by that crap.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.260
All we ever see is rocks and sand.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.220
I should warn them, it's
not very pretty down there.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.860
Tourists treat this lake
like it's a garbage can.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.540
How's it going down there?

32:02.260 --> 32:04.300
Sheriff said that it's a
real treasure trove down there

32:04.740 --> 32:09.700
so I've got dibs on the old
body spray, and 'Jugs' magazines

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
- I got dibs on home appliances.
- I got missing college girls

32:19.300 --> 32:20.500
Oh my God!

32:21.940 --> 32:23.700
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.500
Focus on the task.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.180
At least 200 feet Novak

32:41.220 --> 32:42.540
Almost full visibility.

32:48.420 --> 32:51.220
You should see this. It's amazing!

32:53.820 --> 32:56.460
Novak, do you hear me?
- Yes, copy that

33:01.260 --> 33:04.860
You're about 90 feet to the
entrance of the connecting cave

33:08.900 --> 33:10.700
It looks like single file time

33:11.580 --> 33:12.420
I'll go first

33:12.455 --> 33:14.740
No, I should de the preliminary scout.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.660
Anyway, you'll get us stuck!

33:16.700 --> 33:17.940
Baby, I'm like an eel.

33:18.100 --> 33:22.260
Electrical eel can get into
small spaces that it is shocking.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.100
That's weird

33:24.940 --> 33:27.460
Here they are and they're splitting up

33:31.140 --> 33:34.620
Is everything alright? I'm
losing you a little bit here.

33:48.780 --> 33:50.820
I'm getting a serious
drop in temperature

33:50.855 --> 33:51.780
it's at least 30 degrees colder.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.660
You're probably at the
mouth of the underwater lake

33:56.860 --> 33:58.100
Do you see anything?

34:00.420 --> 34:02.340
I'm entering the cave

34:24.219 --> 34:25.900
Jesus!

34:25.940 --> 34:27.659
It seems endless.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.340
You gotta see this.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.820
This is incredible

35:42.180 --> 35:44.260
What do you see down there?

35:46.140 --> 35:47.220
Something just bit me!

35:48.740 --> 35:51.780
Yes, okay, I thought you
like that kinda stuff?

36:02.100 --> 36:05.740
Sam! Sam! Answer me!

36:21.020 --> 36:23.420
Something's happening.
- What? I don't know. Give me my flippers.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.300
Oh my God!

37:39.140 --> 37:42.980
Your body is a temple, and now
it is time to thank the Gods.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.140
Andrew, camera.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.180
Come on you. No, no, no.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.420
No, thanks. I think I've
already had too much.

37:51.455 --> 37:53.780
Come on, don't you want to
worship at a beautiful altar.

37:53.820 --> 37:57.620
I know you prefer champagne, but you
believe us, you can trust Crystal.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.780
Come on Derick, she said no.

38:01.020 --> 38:05.260
No, she said 'no thanks', there's a difference. She
understands that gratitude is the right attitude.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.740
Kelly, come on, trust us. It's never
cheating if it's with another chick!

38:10.775 --> 38:11.700
Come on. -Try.

38:11.735 --> 38:12.660
Come on, it's fun

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
Have fun, do it! Everybody's doing it

38:15.750 --> 38:17.150
You're not trying to
take away her fun are you?

38:17.500 --> 38:20.540
She's er... she's not my girlfriend.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.140
Fine! I'll do it.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.620
First you lick the salt -ok

38:30.140 --> 38:31.460
Here we go, come over here

38:31.660 --> 38:33.700
Then you suck up the tequila.

38:40.220 --> 38:43.820
You don't have to do it.
- I don't think we need any of your babysitting here Jake.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.140
OK.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.780
And to try with Jake and Kelly?

39:21.815 --> 39:22.660
What?
- What?

39:22.695 --> 39:23.620
I think not.

39:24.940 --> 39:28.500
Come on guys, are we shooting porn
today or not? Lets make a decision

39:33.420 --> 39:35.140
Thanks Crystal. Come Kelly.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.420
Yes, and salt.

39:44.260 --> 39:45.540
A little tequila.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.060
Let's go.

40:23.060 --> 40:26.060
Mr. Goodman?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.320
Coming.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.480
I'm coming, hold your horses

40:33.880 --> 40:35.880
The store is closed

40:44.320 --> 40:47.080
I want to know what the hell
this thing is doing in my lake?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.560
Where did you catch this?

40:50.600 --> 40:51.680
In the middle of the lake.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Where there are 2 people dead!

41:00.640 --> 41:03.760
Oh my!God! "Oh my" yeah that's right

41:04.520 --> 41:05.880
Excuse me, but is
that a fucking Piranha?

41:06.560 --> 41:09.800
And it's not the only one.
- There are thousands.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Thousands! And they're pissed!

41:12.280 --> 41:13.760
I heard about these things happening.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.120
It's like those baby alligators in
New Jersey, someone leaves them...

41:17.320 --> 41:18.560
... and then they bread.
- What?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.160
Who released these fish into the lake?

41:22.400 --> 41:23.720
What are you talking about?

41:24.360 --> 41:27.120
This particular of piranha

41:27.320 --> 41:29.560
vanished from the face of the earth

41:29.720 --> 41:32.040
more than two million years ago!

41:35.280 --> 41:36.520
Where's he going?

41:41.480 --> 41:44.560
Allow me... to introduce...

41:48.960 --> 41:54.320
The Pygocentrus. The original piranha

41:55.160 --> 41:57.520
They used to swim the Colorado River

41:58.200 --> 42:01.240
Right up until the Ice Age.

42:02.200 --> 42:05.720
I don't understand how
you found one... alive?

42:09.840 --> 42:13.280
We discovered a subterannean lake,
through a rift created by the quake

42:13.720 --> 42:17.280
How could it have survived so
long, cut off from the surface?

42:18.120 --> 42:19.600
Cannibalism.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.360
They must have fought
each other to survive.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.040
See.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.320
Scars.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.080
See the eyes.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.840
Jesus. It's like they're
staring abck at you

42:36.280 --> 42:40.760
No, no, no. Not staring. Sensing.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.360
God! Dont do that.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.520
Piranhas hunt in packs.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.400
Not for protection, but
for overwhelming force.

42:56.840 --> 42:59.200
They're organised, methodical

43:00.680 --> 43:05.600
The first bite draws the
blood, the blood draws the pack

43:05.880 --> 43:07.840
How do I stop them?

43:08.200 --> 43:11.400
Sorry, you're not actually thinking
about going back out onto the lake?

43:11.480 --> 43:16.280
They are killing machines but they are
still fish. You can catch them or kill them.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.000
But if there really
are thousands... -Yes?

43:21.640 --> 43:24.720
Yesterday would have
been a good time to start.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.320
Shit.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.800
My little brother and sister.

44:38.400 --> 44:39.800
Are they waving for help?

44:40.480 --> 44:43.960
I don't know. They should
be home. I should be home.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.560
Jake, what are you doing?
You're gonna miss my money shot

44:47.000 --> 44:49.360
It's my familly alright!
They could be in trouble

44:49.920 --> 44:54.040
You'll be in trouble if you don't
get my flying cacas right now!

44:54.080 --> 44:56.240
What the hell is wrong with you man?

45:00.400 --> 45:01.680
What's wrong with me?

45:03.920 --> 45:06.520
Oh Godamit, your missing it,
your missing it, your missing it.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.160
Oh you missed it!
What is wrong with you?

45:12.480 --> 45:15.000
Listen, they're stranded out there.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.600
They might need my help

45:18.400 --> 45:21.880
Listen to me. My mum is sheriff.

45:36.840 --> 45:41.640
OK. Let's swing by the island.
Throw the minnows in the boat.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.520
It'll be fun.

46:08.720 --> 46:09.760
Get me up!

46:22.640 --> 46:23.760
Get me up!

46:24.360 --> 46:25.560
What's going on?

46:40.600 --> 46:42.600
Alright Lake Victoria, are
you ready for some titties?!

47:04.320 --> 47:07.640
Look at those weapons of masturbation!

47:11.520 --> 47:13.000
Change!

47:36.240 --> 47:37.560
Yes, we need the National Guard...

47:37.800 --> 47:41.400
...We need the Coast Guard! I need all
the forces you have the power to deploy!

47:43.040 --> 47:45.520
Everybody back to the beach!

47:47.480 --> 47:49.280
Everybody back!

48:03.560 --> 48:05.640
<i>Read the Bible.</i>

48:06.520 --> 48:10.040
Don't talk about faith. Take the
boat. No more talk about faith

48:19.080 --> 48:20.160
What the hell?

48:28.360 --> 48:31.560
This is the Lake Victoria
Sherrifs Department,

48:31.760 --> 48:35.080
The Sherrif has declared an emergency.

48:35.115 --> 48:37.880
Don't worry, we've got beer over here!

48:38.480 --> 48:40.080
Cannonball!

48:43.240 --> 48:45.960
I need you out of the water, now!

49:20.280 --> 49:23.120
Jake? Why is he here?

49:23.155 --> 49:23.880
I don't know.

49:23.915 --> 49:26.200
We are so busted.
- No, he is.

49:26.235 --> 49:27.840
I didn't even catch a fish!

49:27.920 --> 49:30.040
Slow down.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.720
OK, Jake,I'm not taking the fall
for this. It was all Zanes idea

49:44.200 --> 49:47.040
I paid you $60 to stay
home. What do you mean.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.560
I'll give you 40 and we are quits.

49:48.760 --> 49:51.840
How about you get on a boat,
go home and end of story.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.800
Just get on the boat.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.400
We should've been on the beach an hour
ago for the muthafucking main event.

50:00.435 --> 50:02.240
Let's go!

50:03.000 --> 50:06.240
Be careful pulling away from here.
The rocks can strip away the engine

50:15.880 --> 50:18.400
Why don't you go and get some rest. Take Zane and
Laura with you, I don't want them anywhere near them.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.280
The water is so clear.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.760
What kind of fish was that?

50:27.960 --> 50:29.000
I don't know.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.120
I'm gonna make them take
us home right now, ok?

50:34.160 --> 50:35.120
What is that?

50:35.800 --> 50:36.640
What happened?

50:38.720 --> 50:39.840
Are you okay?

50:41.200 --> 50:42.440
I think we hit something.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.200
Andrew! Andrew, what
the hell is going on?

50:52.720 --> 50:54.520
I don't know. We're stuck on something.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.560
Well, fix it Godamit

50:56.960 --> 50:59.640
There are rocks everywhere.
- Yeah, they're down here.

51:00.280 --> 51:01.280
What happened?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.280
I think there's something
caught on the prop

51:05.500 --> 51:06.580
Stay here.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.060
Crystal, get the sand rat up here

51:11.300 --> 51:13.940
I said get the fucking sand rat
up here! What's wrong with you?

51:14.980 --> 51:16.380
Why can't you go get him yourself?

51:25.420 --> 51:29.300
I'm just down here thinking how this
whole fucked up day is your fault.

51:32.740 --> 51:36.460
You wont help us with the new bitch, you don't do a fucking
thing I tell you and you take us way the fuck of course!

51:39.060 --> 51:44.180
I get it, you're new at
this. I'm cool with that...

51:44.215 --> 51:45.140
but what you're doing...

51:46.620 --> 51:48.500
what this is...

51:48.700 --> 51:50.580
there's a word for it...

51:51.700 --> 51:53.660
It's a boat word, er what is it?

51:54.980 --> 51:57.100
Mutiny! Is that what
this is? Is it a mutiny

51:59.820 --> 52:03.060
Relax Derek, ok? It's
just getting a little wild

52:09.940 --> 52:12.980
If anyone should be down there
helping, it oughta be you!

52:15.820 --> 52:16.820
Let me do that. Let me do that!

52:18.060 --> 52:19.020
Let me do it!

52:28.620 --> 52:30.460
This is an emergency. I need
everyone out of the water now!

52:30.495 --> 52:33.100
Get out of water now!
This is an emergency!

52:33.135 --> 52:34.140
Get out of the water now!

54:08.860 --> 54:11.460
Come on! Come on!

55:06.140 --> 55:08.420
Oh my God!

55:26.700 --> 55:28.660
Oh my God!

55:47.700 --> 55:48.700
What are you doing?

55:50.740 --> 55:51.860
Where are you going?

55:52.340 --> 55:54.860
Throw me a gun!
- It's fully loaded

56:14.860 --> 56:17.940
Swim to the beach! Get out of water!

56:44.660 --> 56:47.180
Get out of water!

57:11.180 --> 57:12.340
Come on!

57:27.100 --> 57:29.420
Todd, what are you doing?

57:34.620 --> 57:39.140
Get the fuck out of the way!

58:57.100 --> 58:58.620
You're gonna kill the engine.

59:05.580 --> 59:09.300
Zane, Laura, hold on to something
and get back from the glass.

59:13.260 --> 59:14.220
Come on!

59:14.620 --> 59:15.620
Come on!

59:16.060 --> 59:16.900
Yes, yes!

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.980
Holy shit!

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.780
Let's go!

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.180
Are you okay?

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.060
Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.340
Where is Kelly?
- It is on the other side.

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.300
There.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.780
Kelly! Kelly!

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.580
Jake!

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.780
Get out of the water!

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:53.660
I cant find a way to you.
Get out through the skylite

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.540
Jake!

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.260
Let's go. I don't want you to see this.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.540
They took my penis! They took my penis.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.980
Jake hurry up, the
water's getting higher

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.060
Jake!

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.020
Kelly!

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.020
Hurry up!

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.300
Chew on this muthafuckers!

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.660
Everybody out!

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:21.940
All ashore!

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.220
Everybody out!

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.940
No! No!

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.900
Hold this.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.100
This is Sheriff Forester.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.180
Mum?
- Jake.

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.740
I'm sorry, I screwed
up. We're on the lake.

01:05:33.775 --> 01:05:34.700
What?

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:35.860
Where are Laura and Zane?

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.340
They're with me on the boat.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.380
Oh my God, Jake.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.700
Whatever you do, do not enter the water!

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.660
You don't understand,
Mum. Our boat is sinking.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.220
Where are you?

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.420
What are you doing?

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.860
I'm coming with you.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.020
Let's go.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.020
That's mum.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.300
Mum! Hey!

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.940
How are we gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.420
The rope. Do you think it will reach?

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.420
Jake, I'm gonna throw you the rope. I
want you to tie it to the highest railing

01:06:51.455 --> 01:06:52.380
Okay, Mum.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.380
Tied?
- Yes.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.460
Back up a bit.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.100
Watch out for rocks.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.420
Watch out!

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.220
Ready?
- Yes.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.820
Yes.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.340
Keep it tight. I've got my radio

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.740
Hold on.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.700
Mum, are you okay?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.140
Is this everybody on the boat?

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.620
No, Kelly is stuck down in the
cabin. We can't get her out.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.620
We can't get her out.
- Kelly?

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.460
God! Kelly?

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.220
Can you reach my arm?

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.460
Help me get out of here.
Water is getting higher!

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.500
- Can you reach the skylite? It
doesn't matter. It's fucking stuck!

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.340
Jake!

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.899
I'm scared!

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:25.180
Please help!

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:30.460
Mum, hurry!
- Kelly?

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:33.500
- Were gonna die. We
are not gonna die, OK?

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.899
I need your help! Please!

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:46.859
The only way to reach it under the ship.

01:08:46.895 --> 01:08:47.819
All of the rope.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.740
What are you talking about?
We can't leave her there.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:54.260
When we all go over the
rope, I'll come back for her.

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:56.500
I'm not leaving without her mum!

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.779
Jesus, Jake! The only way to get to
her is for you to get into the water

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:02.260
I'm not gonna let you do that!

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.819
The reason she got on
this boat was coz of me

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:06.620
This is my fault.

01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:11.500
I'm not going without her.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.180
This isn't gonna hold
much longer. Let's go!

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:18.060
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura
across and when I get back,

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.620
we are gonna do this. Together.

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:22.819
OK.

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.779
We're gonna keep the 2 little
ones between us, you go first.

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.779
Can you do this?
- You better believe it! I don't pole dance for nothing!

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.540
You have a lot of explaining to do.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.620
Ready?

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.500
Be careful, don't look down. Let's go.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.460
Just like at the playground guys,

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.420
... hand over hand

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.780
Don't look down.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.940
Don't look down, alright.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.580
Come on, you can do this.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.060
Don't look down.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.620
GET OFF ME!

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.260
No! No!

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.580
Godammit!

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.900
Laura, listen to me!

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.220
If you move fast, it will not get you.

01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:14.180
You have to move now!

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.500
Come on!

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.700
OK guys, you're here.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.100
You did it.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.300
Let's go, keep moving!

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:54.340
Are you ok?

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.740
Cut the engine.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.140
What are you doing?

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.980
Jake, what are you doing?

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:04.820
What are you doing?

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.100
Jake!

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.620
Jake, do not!

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.340
They want blood, don't they?

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.900
Well, we'll give them.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:26.260
Wet T-shirt,
wet t-shirt.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.980
Jake!

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.420
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.740
We're gonna get out of here. Both of us!

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.500
I'm in! I you need to pull us out
as fast as possible! Do you copy?

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.820
Ok, we're ready when you are.

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.540
Jake, what are you doing?
They're gonna come back.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.260
I gave them a snack. That's gonna
hold them off for a while at least

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.860
I need you to tie these together ok?
- Why?

01:14:18.895 --> 01:14:19.820
Just do it!

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.620
Where are you going?

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.740
Jake!

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.580
Hold your breath, we'll swim
to the bottom of the boat.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.660
I need you to hold on tight.
Can you hold on tight to me?

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:03.340
I need you to pull us out in 10 seconds, do you copy?
- We copy. 10 seconds from your signal.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.900
Get the kids down.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.860
10.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.220
6... 5... 4...

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.180
... 3... 2... 1

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.900
Come on!

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.860
Come on, fucking thing!

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.860
Oh my God!

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.820
Holy shit!

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.540
Are you okay?

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.180
Kick your legs, come on!

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.460
Let's go!

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.300
You're alright.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.700
Breathe, you're ok.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.180
You're alright.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.660
Oh my God! It's good
to have you on board!

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.340
Shit.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.940
Look mum, over there.

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.740
They died.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.060
They're all dead.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.540
You did it Jake!

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.660
Hey, it worked.

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.980
I thought dynamite fishing is
illegal in these parts sheriff?

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.140
Sheriff! Sherrif?

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.220
Yes, this Julie.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.380
Julie, we have a major problem.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.700
I'm looking out at a school of dead piranha.
It's not all of them, but it's a good start.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.020
You don't understand.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.740
The specimen you left with me

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:22.900
has no mature reproductive organs.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.460
What? What are you talking about?

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:31.380
The piranhas that killed those
divers, the ones you're hunting for...

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.380
They're not fully developed!

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.740
They're the babies!

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.860
Babies?

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.540
Well, where are the parents?
