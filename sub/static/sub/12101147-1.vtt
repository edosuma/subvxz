And I'm scared.

58:08.110 --> 58:10.986
Because I'm getting
really good at it.

58:13.449 --> 58:15.991
I'm starting to like it.

58:26.086 --> 58:29.338
[laughing] oh, sweetie,
do you really think

58:29.381 --> 58:31.965
we befriended you because
of your personality?

58:32.009 --> 58:33.550
It's the yacht, darling.

58:33.636 --> 58:34.885
[laughs]

58:34.970 --> 58:36.637
and god knows I certainly
didn't marry beau

58:36.722 --> 58:38.514
for his brains or good
business sense

58:38.557 --> 58:41.350
so clearly we'll never be
able to afford one.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.351
[sighs]

58:44.146 --> 58:45.521
[laughs]
yes!

58:53.322 --> 58:58.659
Honey, I'm sorry about the joke
about your brains last night,

58:58.744 --> 59:02.996
I got carried away
with my gisselle act.

59:03.082 --> 59:04.456
There were points
in the conversation

59:04.542 --> 59:07.209
where even I couldn't
tell the difference.

59:09.797 --> 59:11.922
Where are you going?

59:12.007 --> 59:14.049
I'm want to call paul.

59:19.139 --> 59:22.808
He said if you ever call to just
tell you he's unavailable.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.393
How is he doing?

59:24.436 --> 59:27.729
<i> He's been getting worse</i>
<i> and worse, gisselle.</i>

59:27.773 --> 59:30.816
He's even started sleeping
in your grandmére's shack,

59:30.901 --> 59:35.070
<i> saying it reminds him of when</i>
<i> he and ruby were younger.</i>

59:35.114 --> 59:37.406
It's so unfair.

59:37.449 --> 59:40.701
They were the most perfect
couple in the world.

59:40.786 --> 59:45.122
<i> Two people living</i>
<i> a fantasy romance.</i>

59:45.207 --> 59:48.208
Yeah, well, maybe
it was a fantasy.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.260
Gisselle.

59:59.972 --> 1:00:01.263
Bruce.

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:03.098
How on earth did you get in?

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:06.268
Well, I lived here for years,
remember?

1:00:06.353 --> 1:00:08.228
I know every nook
of this place.

1:00:08.314 --> 1:00:10.772
Well, now that you've found
your way in,

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:13.942
use those same skills
to find your way out.

1:00:14.028 --> 1:00:17.404
I'm not going anywhere
until I get what I deserve.

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:20.032
That will was not fair

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:23.160
and I deserve my share
of the family fortune,

1:00:23.245 --> 1:00:24.661
and you're gonna give it
to me.

1:00:24.747 --> 1:00:26.622
There's nothing in the world
you can say

1:00:26.665 --> 1:00:31.501
to make me give you even
one penny of that money.

1:00:31.587 --> 1:00:34.463
Wait a minute,
did you do this?

1:00:34.548 --> 1:00:39.468
Because only ruby could do
something like that.

1:00:44.933 --> 1:00:46.224
Oh...

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.143
[laughs]

1:00:48.228 --> 1:00:49.519
you're ruby.

1:00:49.605 --> 1:00:50.729
Bruce, you're drunk.

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:51.980
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:00:52.066 --> 1:00:53.607
Yes, I do.

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:55.442
I know you're up to something,

1:00:55.527 --> 1:00:57.277
and I'm gonna tell
the whole world about it

1:00:57.363 --> 1:00:59.029
unless you give me
what I want.

1:00:59.114 --> 1:01:03.158
'cause once I start pulling
at threads,

1:01:03.202 --> 1:01:05.911
something's gonna unravel.

1:01:05.996 --> 1:01:09.414
You're not gonna say a word
because I know enough

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.458
about all of your
back-alley deals

1:01:11.543 --> 1:01:13.210
and the crap you pulled

1:01:13.295 --> 1:01:15.045
when you were the dumas
family fixer

1:01:15.130 --> 1:01:17.381
to discredit you up
and down the state.

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:18.840
And if I really need to,

1:01:18.926 --> 1:01:20.634
I know and gisselle
once messed around

1:01:20.719 --> 1:01:22.511
while my father was dying.

1:01:22.596 --> 1:01:24.846
And what's that gonna look like
to polite society?

1:01:24.932 --> 1:01:26.890
A creepy old man
making an advance

1:01:26.975 --> 1:01:30.560
on his sweet little underage
future stepdaughter?

1:01:30.646 --> 1:01:31.395
That's not true.

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:32.854
Yes, it is.

1:01:32.898 --> 1:01:35.482
You've always been inappropriate
towards me and gisselle.

1:01:35.567 --> 1:01:36.858
No.

1:01:36.944 --> 1:01:38.735
And you can't prove any of that.

1:01:38.821 --> 1:01:42.155
Well, I bet if I start
pulling at threads

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:44.825
something will unravel.

1:01:47.329 --> 1:01:48.787
That's what I thought.

1:01:48.872 --> 1:01:50.414
Now, get out of my house.

1:01:50.499 --> 1:01:51.707
I have company coming

1:01:51.792 --> 1:01:54.710
and I don't want you here
when they arrive.

1:01:57.339 --> 1:02:01.216
I'm just worried about
who I'm becoming.

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:06.179
There is power in gisselle's
assertiveness that feels good,

1:02:06.265 --> 1:02:10.225
but it also feels... Ugly.

1:02:10.269 --> 1:02:12.060
Well, the fact that
you're worried about it

1:02:12.146 --> 1:02:14.730
tells me you'll
never become gisselle.

1:02:14.773 --> 1:02:18.900
You'll always be that
kind-hearted ruby on the inside.

1:02:18.944 --> 1:02:21.111
Will I, though?

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:23.822
Today, with bruce...

1:02:23.907 --> 1:02:27.909
Gisselle just took over
and it felt right.

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:32.581
Sometimes anger
is justifiable.

1:02:32.624 --> 1:02:35.167
You have lived the real truth
of that statement.

1:02:35.252 --> 1:02:37.169
So have you, my friend.

1:02:37.254 --> 1:02:40.088
[phone rings]

1:02:40.174 --> 1:02:41.673
excuse me.

1:02:41.759 --> 1:02:45.510
[phone rings]

1:02:45.596 --> 1:02:47.429
<i> jeanne: Ruby is dead.</i>

1:02:48.348 --> 1:02:49.765
Ruby is dead?

1:02:49.850 --> 1:02:53.101
<i> Yes, she... She died</i>
<i> this afternoon.</i>

1:02:53.145 --> 1:02:57.647
Paul was there holding her hand
as she went.

1:02:57.733 --> 1:03:01.234
Oh my god, jeanne,
this is awful.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:05.405
Paul has requested that you
not bring pearl to the funeral.

1:03:05.491 --> 1:03:09.117
If you even bother coming
at all.

1:03:16.460 --> 1:03:20.545
[sobbing]

1:03:20.631 --> 1:03:24.508
they're thinking it's me
who died.

1:03:24.593 --> 1:03:30.722
I just couldn't bear the sadness
and anger in jeanne's voice.

1:03:30.808 --> 1:03:36.311
And then they said,
"if you come at all."

1:03:36.355 --> 1:03:38.855
of course we're coming
to the funeral.

1:03:38.941 --> 1:03:41.817
We're not monsters.

1:03:45.030 --> 1:03:48.156
Oh, my god.

1:03:48.242 --> 1:03:51.117
I am going to my own funeral.

1:03:59.294 --> 1:04:01.127
I'm so sorry for your loss,
madame gisselle.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:03.171
Your sister was
a wondrous person.

1:04:05.217 --> 1:04:08.510
Paul really believes
he's burying ruby?

1:04:08.595 --> 1:04:11.304
In a way, he is.

1:04:17.145 --> 1:04:18.353
Oh ruby.

1:04:20.607 --> 1:04:22.524
My sweetest sunshine.

1:04:26.613 --> 1:04:28.321
I miss you.

1:04:30.784 --> 1:04:33.326
That's my true love.

1:04:37.749 --> 1:04:40.709
I'll never know another
like ruby landry.

1:04:49.803 --> 1:04:53.471
She's gone.

1:04:53.557 --> 1:04:56.558
She's never coming back,
gisselle.

1:05:01.773 --> 1:05:04.190
It's over.

1:05:16.330 --> 1:05:20.415
I'm sorry, gisselle.

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:25.378
I didn't know it was gonna end
this way.

1:05:28.467 --> 1:05:30.091
[sobs]

1:05:30.177 --> 1:05:36.932
this is so surreal,
watching people cry over me,

1:05:36.975 --> 1:05:41.227
and gazing into a coffin that's
supposed to have my body in it.

1:05:41.271 --> 1:05:44.773
It makes me feel
absolutely ghoulish.

1:05:55.744 --> 1:05:59.829
Paul is a complete shadow
of himself.

1:05:59.915 --> 1:06:02.958
I don't know if he'll ever
come back to us.

1:06:03.001 --> 1:06:04.751
I don't know what you want me
to do about it.

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:07.754
Oh, stop your pretending.

1:06:07.839 --> 1:06:10.840
I know what you
and your lover did.

1:06:10.926 --> 1:06:12.217
I don't know what
you're talking-

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:16.012
I always knew that you would
destroy paul.

1:06:16.098 --> 1:06:17.639
Ruby.

1:06:20.227 --> 1:06:23.269
Maybe my husband,
beau and I,

1:06:23.313 --> 1:06:25.814
can help paul get back
on his feet.

1:06:25.899 --> 1:06:28.817
I'd rather ask the devil
himself for help.

1:06:30.404 --> 1:06:37.951
I just want you to know
that I know

1:06:38.036 --> 1:06:40.620
why my son is
so broken-hearted

1:06:40.664 --> 1:06:46.543
and I will not sit by
and let him suffer.

1:06:46.628 --> 1:06:49.295
Without you suffering
twice as much.

1:06:50.132 --> 1:06:51.297
-Paul's missing.
-What?

1:06:51.383 --> 1:06:52.298
-He's gone.
-Where?

1:06:52.384 --> 1:06:53.925
I don't know,
he just ran off.

1:06:54.011 --> 1:06:56.052
He was talking crazy about how
he couldn't live without ruby.

1:06:56.138 --> 1:06:57.345
Where did he go?

1:06:57.389 --> 1:06:58.471
We have to stop him.

1:06:58.557 --> 1:06:59.806
<i> Jeanne: I don't know,</i>
<i> I don't know.</i>

1:07:04.354 --> 1:07:05.687
This way.

1:07:11.528 --> 1:07:13.403
How do you know
about this place?

1:07:13.488 --> 1:07:15.655
Ruby used to describe it to me
in detail.

1:07:15.741 --> 1:07:17.198
She and paul
used to come here

1:07:17.284 --> 1:07:18.992
to be together
when they were kids.

1:07:19.077 --> 1:07:21.995
Somehow it's the only thing I
ever remembered that she said.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:25.040
Have some respect for the dead,
gisselle.

1:07:25.083 --> 1:07:26.916
I'm sorry.

1:07:27.002 --> 1:07:29.044
That was uncalled for.

1:07:32.299 --> 1:07:33.882
Shall we?

1:08:05.624 --> 1:08:06.664
There!

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:08.249
He's under there!

1:08:17.594 --> 1:08:19.010
[gasps]

1:08:19.096 --> 1:08:21.930
he couldn't live
without his ruby.

1:08:22.766 --> 1:08:24.766
Honey, come back!

1:08:28.438 --> 1:08:33.733
[sobbing]

1:08:33.819 --> 1:08:40.949
[wailing]

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:43.660
it's okay.

1:08:43.745 --> 1:08:45.036
It's gonna be okay.

1:08:45.122 --> 1:08:46.788
Alright.

1:08:46.873 --> 1:08:48.289
It's okay.

1:09:02.931 --> 1:09:07.183
-Are you okay?
-No.

1:09:07.269 --> 1:09:09.185
Fair enough.

1:09:09.271 --> 1:09:10.770
I just wanted to let you know

1:09:10.856 --> 1:09:17.360
that a special little someone's
here and wants to say hello.

1:09:17.445 --> 1:09:19.654
Thank you, sweet pearl.

1:09:19.698 --> 1:09:22.490
I really needed to see
your smile today.

1:09:22.534 --> 1:09:26.369
[child's laughter]

1:09:26.454 --> 1:09:28.121
you know, all I ever wanted
was for you

1:09:28.165 --> 1:09:32.041
to have a better life
than I had.

1:09:32.127 --> 1:09:34.294
You deserve it,
baby girl.

1:09:41.094 --> 1:09:42.135
What on earth is it?

1:09:42.179 --> 1:09:44.053
How dare you disturb me
like this?

1:09:44.139 --> 1:09:45.263
Sorry, ma'am.

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:47.015
There's a young woman
at the door for you.

1:09:49.019 --> 1:09:50.351
I'll be down in a minute.

1:09:50.395 --> 1:09:52.020
As you wish.

1:09:53.607 --> 1:09:55.523
Go back to daddy, pearl.

1:10:06.244 --> 1:10:08.077
Jeanne, hi.

1:10:08.163 --> 1:10:10.079
What are you doing here?

1:10:10.165 --> 1:10:11.414
My parents asked me

1:10:11.499 --> 1:10:13.666
to deliver this news to you
in person, gisselle.

1:10:13.752 --> 1:10:17.337
First, we would prefer if you
did not attend paul's funeral.

1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:20.006
Second, paul and ruby's daughter

1:10:20.091 --> 1:10:21.883
belongs with her grandpére
and grandmére,

1:10:21.927 --> 1:10:23.468
not her self-centered aunt.

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:27.138
So your promises,
your obligations, are over.

1:10:27.224 --> 1:10:32.060
You can go back to living your
life of pleasure and not worry.

1:10:32.103 --> 1:10:34.812
Oh, that's okay.
I'm sort of getting used to it.

1:10:34.898 --> 1:10:35.897
And so is pearl.

1:10:35.941 --> 1:10:38.233
It seems she thinks
I'm her mama.

1:10:38.318 --> 1:10:39.275
Hmm.

1:10:39.319 --> 1:10:42.237
And yet you are not
her mother.

1:10:46.326 --> 1:10:47.408
Mrs. Gisselle andreas,

1:10:47.452 --> 1:10:49.202
I represent octavious
and gladys tate.

1:10:49.287 --> 1:10:51.120
They have filed
a custody lawsuit

1:10:51.206 --> 1:10:52.664
and a judge has issued
a court order saying

1:10:52.749 --> 1:10:54.874
that we will take your niece,
pearl tate, with us

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:56.918
back to her grandparents.

1:10:57.003 --> 1:10:58.753
No, there's been some
sort of misunderstanding-

1:10:58.838 --> 1:11:01.339
I'm afraid not and I can't
leave without the child.

1:11:01.424 --> 1:11:03.258
We are prepared to charge
you with obstruction

1:11:03.343 --> 1:11:04.926
if you choose not
to cooperate.

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:06.552
Ultimately, the courts
will decide,

1:11:06.638 --> 1:11:09.764
but until then pearl will be in
the custody of her grandparents.

1:11:11.893 --> 1:11:13.851
What the hell is going on here?

1:11:13.937 --> 1:11:16.604
They're taking pearl, beau.
They're taking pearl.

1:11:16.690 --> 1:11:17.605
Slow down.

1:11:18.566 --> 1:11:20.483
They're claiming custody
of pearl.

1:11:20.568 --> 1:11:21.943
They filed a court order.

1:11:22.028 --> 1:11:25.446
The lawyer, the police,
they've come to get her.

1:11:25.532 --> 1:11:26.990
This is what gladys meant by

1:11:27.075 --> 1:11:29.659
making ruby suffer twice
as much as paul.

1:11:29.744 --> 1:11:31.452
She's taking vengeance.

1:11:31.496 --> 1:11:32.829
It'll be all right.

1:11:32.914 --> 1:11:35.623
We can figure it out.

1:11:35.667 --> 1:11:38.835
They can't take our baby
away from us.

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.461
Please, don't do this.

1:11:40.547 --> 1:11:42.588
Mrs. Andreas, don't make this
harder or more dramatic

1:11:42.674 --> 1:11:45.758
than it needs to be,
especially for the child.

1:11:56.521 --> 1:11:58.313
It's okay my sweetest pearl.

1:11:58.356 --> 1:11:59.647
You're just going on a trip

1:11:59.733 --> 1:12:01.941
to grandmére and grandpére's
house for a while.

1:12:02.027 --> 1:12:03.443
They'll take good care
of you

1:12:03.486 --> 1:12:05.653
and then I will
come get you back.

1:12:08.325 --> 1:12:09.657
[exhales]

1:12:30.138 --> 1:12:32.180
mommy!

1:12:32.265 --> 1:12:33.139
It's okay.

1:12:33.892 --> 1:12:34.682
It's okay.

1:12:36.478 --> 1:12:38.186
It's okay.

1:12:38.229 --> 1:12:40.188
<i> [pearl crying]</i>

1:12:41.691 --> 1:12:46.194
[sobbing]

1:12:55.538 --> 1:12:57.413
what if we tell the truth?

1:12:57.499 --> 1:13:00.541
We just say gisselle and I
switched places.

1:13:00.585 --> 1:13:03.044
To hell with what
everyone thinks.

1:13:03.088 --> 1:13:05.463
We have to be strategic
about this.

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:09.759
No, beau, I am tired of lying.

1:13:09.844 --> 1:13:12.553
I said a long time ago that
the most important thing

1:13:12.639 --> 1:13:15.223
was to live a good life.

1:13:15.266 --> 1:13:17.350
To be honest and always do
the right thing,

1:13:17.394 --> 1:13:20.395
but look at what I've become.

1:13:20.438 --> 1:13:25.900
I only recognize myself
when I look in my baby's eyes.

1:13:25.944 --> 1:13:29.946
So I'm gonna get back
to being who I really am.

1:13:30.031 --> 1:13:33.533
And I'm gonna start
by telling the truth.

1:13:38.998 --> 1:13:41.874
I switched places with gisselle
to be with the man I love.

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:45.002
If we can prove that you're ruby
then beau can testify

1:13:45.088 --> 1:13:46.379
to being the father
of the child.

1:13:46.464 --> 1:13:47.713
Of course.

1:13:47.799 --> 1:13:49.382
And yet you say there are
no birth certificates

1:13:49.467 --> 1:13:52.552
or medical records of your birth
or your sister's.

1:13:52.637 --> 1:13:54.137
I'm afraid not.

1:13:54.222 --> 1:13:56.931
My sister and I were born
in swamp country.

1:13:56.975 --> 1:13:59.475
No doctors, no hospitals,

1:13:59.561 --> 1:14:02.437
which means no paperwork
or birth certificates.

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:05.648
I hear there's something
called dna technology,

1:14:05.733 --> 1:14:07.400
which will be able
to clear this up

1:14:07.485 --> 1:14:09.110
with a simple blood test
one day.

1:14:09.195 --> 1:14:11.446
But we're years away
from that.

1:14:11.531 --> 1:14:13.406
A handwriting sample?

1:14:13.491 --> 1:14:15.241
Their penmanship
is clearly different.

1:14:15.326 --> 1:14:18.286
That's hardly conclusive.

1:14:18.371 --> 1:14:19.620
What about the doctor

1:14:19.706 --> 1:14:22.874
who originally treated gisselle
for encephalitis?

1:14:22.959 --> 1:14:24.792
We can't call on him.

1:14:24.878 --> 1:14:27.920
I made a deal financially
and he disappeared west.

1:14:28.006 --> 1:14:30.256
Uh-huh. Very well.

1:14:30.341 --> 1:14:33.426
The staff at the ranch
or the dumas mansion?

1:14:33.511 --> 1:14:36.304
None of them knew
what was happening.

1:14:36.389 --> 1:14:38.306
We were very careful.

1:14:38.391 --> 1:14:40.516
So the tates believe
that they buried ruby tate

1:14:40.602 --> 1:14:44.145
and there was a death
certificate issued in your name.

1:14:44.230 --> 1:14:46.189
Yes.

1:14:46.274 --> 1:14:49.150
I can't believe we did so
much to convince the world

1:14:49.194 --> 1:14:51.819
I was gisselle
and we did it so well

1:14:51.905 --> 1:14:56.282
that now no one will believe
the truth.

1:14:56.326 --> 1:14:59.243
This may end up being your word
against the tates,

1:14:59.329 --> 1:15:02.330
and we'll do our best to tell
your story as sympathetically

1:15:02.415 --> 1:15:06.000
as we can, but this will be
assigned to a bayou court,

1:15:06.044 --> 1:15:07.627
with a bayou judge,

1:15:07.712 --> 1:15:10.796
so we will likely be at a
significant disadvantage.

1:15:10.882 --> 1:15:13.633
And prepare for the press
to have a field day.

1:15:13.676 --> 1:15:15.718
We're prepared for that,

1:15:15.803 --> 1:15:17.803
as long as it means
we can get pearl back.

1:15:17.847 --> 1:15:19.805
If you really want my advice,

1:15:19.891 --> 1:15:22.183
I say you should go over
to the tate's

1:15:22.268 --> 1:15:26.187
and do whatever is necessary
to avoid this trial.

1:15:33.071 --> 1:15:37.073
Mrs. Tate, as one mother
to another,

1:15:37.158 --> 1:15:39.659
I beg of you, please
let this matter go.

1:15:39.744 --> 1:15:44.705
I am doing what is best
for this baby.

1:15:44.791 --> 1:15:47.708
That child does not belong with
a pair of pathological liars.

1:15:47.794 --> 1:15:49.043
For better or for worse,

1:15:49.128 --> 1:15:51.629
your son offered to make
a home for ruby and pearl.

1:15:51.714 --> 1:15:53.714
It was for worse.

1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:55.174
Look at where he is now.

1:15:55.218 --> 1:15:57.552
I understand that, mrs. Tate.

1:15:57.637 --> 1:16:01.347
But hurting another family
won't solve anything.

1:16:01.391 --> 1:16:05.851
In fact, when paul saw the love
between ruby and I

1:16:05.937 --> 1:16:10.773
he agreed to help us have
a real shot at being a family.

1:16:10.858 --> 1:16:13.526
[laughs]

1:16:13.611 --> 1:16:15.027
if this is about the money,

1:16:15.113 --> 1:16:18.489
we can sign over anything we
might stand to gain from it.

1:16:18.575 --> 1:16:21.409
You think I'm worried
about money?

1:16:21.452 --> 1:16:28.541
My son is dead
because of you.

1:16:28.626 --> 1:16:29.917
Get out of my house.

1:16:30.003 --> 1:16:32.503
And out of our lives.

1:16:35.592 --> 1:16:40.261
You put your sister's face on
and you crawled into her skin.

1:16:40.346 --> 1:16:43.264
Now, live there.

Counsellor, do you have
an opening statement?

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:24.764
Thank you, your honor.

1:17:24.849 --> 1:17:27.016
I'd like to leave that statement
for my client,

1:17:27.101 --> 1:17:29.101
ms. Ruby tate.

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:43.282
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1:17:43.368 --> 1:17:46.452
nothing but the truth,
so help you god?

1:17:48.748 --> 1:17:49.997
I do.

1:17:50.083 --> 1:17:51.791
<i> Please be seated.</i>

1:17:55.672 --> 1:18:00.800
So you are telling this court
under oath

1:18:00.843 --> 1:18:04.804
that paul tate married you,
took in someone else's child,

1:18:04.847 --> 1:18:08.974
provided you and her with an
unbelievably lavish lifestyle,

1:18:09.018 --> 1:18:15.439
and then when you committed
adultery right under his nose,

1:18:15.525 --> 1:18:18.025
he didn't bat an eye?

1:18:18.111 --> 1:18:21.862
And then he agreed to take in
your dying sister,

1:18:21.906 --> 1:18:25.533
assume the responsibilities
of her daily care,

1:18:25.618 --> 1:18:30.204
lie to his entire family,
saying that you were her,

1:18:30.248 --> 1:18:35.918
and then when she, I mean "you"
passed away

1:18:36.003 --> 1:18:41.006
he became so distraught
that he took his own life.

1:18:41.092 --> 1:18:45.010
This is the story that you
expect us to believe?

1:18:45.096 --> 1:18:48.055
I... Uh...

1:18:50.143 --> 1:18:52.893
No more questions, your honor.

I just adored them.

1:19:06.367 --> 1:19:09.577
Ruby was such a wonderful girl.

1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:13.164
I was... I was so touched
she asked me to um,

1:19:13.249 --> 1:19:17.918
help decorate her and paul's
beautiful home.

1:19:18.004 --> 1:19:22.798
I can't possibly imagine paul
doing the things they are...

1:19:22.884 --> 1:19:24.550
They're saying that he did.

1:19:24.594 --> 1:19:26.719
She said earlier that...

1:19:26.804 --> 1:19:30.806
That names are just
a formality.

1:19:30.892 --> 1:19:38.272
But I was there when my paul
collapsed with grief,

1:19:38.316 --> 1:19:43.736

"ruby, my sweet ruby, ruby."

Not as long as I live.

No.

1:22:13.471 --> 1:22:15.346

You didn't want your son paul

1:22:19.644 --> 1:22:21.769
It wasn't simply because
you didn't think

1:23:02.645 --> 1:23:09.108
Your honor, when I was a young
man I was hunting in the bayou

young woman.

And though I was married
to gladys at the time,

1:23:26.877 --> 1:23:32.297
I gave in to my desires
that night.

was ruby's mother.

are not for you.

1:25:41.846 --> 1:25:44.471
I've told you, never touch
mommy's stuff.

1:25:44.557 --> 1:25:48.142
Sorry, momma.
They're just so pretty.

1:25:48.227 --> 1:25:50.310
Come here, sweet love.

1:25:52.022 --> 1:25:53.814
What do you think?

1:25:53.899 --> 1:25:55.149
Does that look like mommy?

1:25:55.192 --> 1:25:56.150
Mm-hmm.

1:25:57.778 --> 1:25:59.778
Hello, my lovely ladies.

1:25:59.822 --> 1:26:00.821
Daddy!

1:26:05.161 --> 1:26:08.287
Mommy, can I rub your belly
and say hi to the boys?

1:26:08.330 --> 1:26:10.330
Sure you can, sweetie.

1:26:13.419 --> 1:26:14.751
[gasps]
I felt them kick!

1:26:14.837 --> 1:26:19.256
[laughs]

1:26:19.341 --> 1:26:21.049
to fate.

1:26:21.135 --> 1:26:22.342
And family.

1:26:22.428 --> 1:26:24.178
To fate, and family.

1:26:24.263 --> 1:26:26.430
To fate, and family.

1:26:26.515 --> 1:26:28.515
[laughs]
