00:13.972 --> 00:14.806
Hello!

00:15.974 --> 00:16.808
Hello!

00:17.475 --> 00:18.309
Help!

00:23.106 --> 00:25.567
-There's something in the cemetery!
-Stay back, Neophyte.

00:25.650 --> 00:29.029
Kyle sent me on a bogus challenge,
to dig up a grave and a monster showed up.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.615
I think it's the beast that's killing
all the pledges, it attacked me and Kyle.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.534
[male voice] Not pledges.

00:37.328 --> 00:42.751
Neophytes, of which you are neither,
because you failed your test.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.753
Tell the truth, Kyle.
We both know you were there.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.129
I know of no one named Kyle.

00:46.755 --> 00:50.300
You know what? Fuck you
and fuck your bullshit test.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.554
-Do it.
-[Jack] Do what?

00:55.889 --> 00:59.142
Those magic fun bags are useless.
It did nothing

00:59.225 --> 01:01.019
-against that monster.
-I gave you an order.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.605
[whoosh]

01:04.522 --> 01:05.565
[bang]

01:05.648 --> 01:08.193
[sound of crows cawing]

01:10.320 --> 01:11.154
Care to explain?

01:14.449 --> 01:16.534
Put your fucking mask back on.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.791
Pick him up.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.092
[sound of crows cawing]

01:45.730 --> 01:46.689
[male voice] Wow!

01:48.316 --> 01:50.527
Looks like dick face
can't handle his liquor.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.862
[laughs]

01:52.946 --> 01:53.863
[Kyle] Classic.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.174
I deserve another chance.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.470
The chemistry building?
That's on the other side of campus.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.057
Kyle sandbagged me.
He set me up with a fake test.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.934
Yeah, you just wanna take those doors.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.894
Even if you don't think
I deserve another shot,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.480
you have to use your magic
and hunt down whatever that beast is.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.857
Be quiet.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.699
What the hell was that thing?

02:38.658 --> 02:39.826
Some kind of a test?

02:39.909 --> 02:42.203
Your so-called "beast" wasn't any test.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.664
-Why are you talking about magic?
-Because I've seen it.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.041
And I'm not talking about your gold coin,

02:47.125 --> 02:48.960
birthday magician,
sleight-of-hand bullshit.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.714
I saw stolen eyes project
a dead woman's final memories.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.091
I followed someone in.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.510
A total idiot.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.471
Kyle.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.226
-He isn't a total idiot.
-You went out with that guy?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.145
Phew.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.646
Okay.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.982
Show me a freshman
who doesn't make mistakes.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.110
How's his head? Still ringing?
Sidebar?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.197
-I knew that was you under the robes the--
-I shouldn’t have switched powders.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.239
Yeah, but you did.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.158
And I appreciate it.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.784
But why did you?

03:24.078 --> 03:26.247
Because I realized there are things
you need to remember.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.666
Like what?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.794
Like that The Order can be really cruel
to an outsider.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
Yeah, I'm starting to figure that all out.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.216
Too bad the others
didn't get the same opportunity.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.969
Look, I'm sorry that you didn't make it,
but there are no second chances.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.679
Stay out of this.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.890
We have this under control.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.017
If somebody doesn't do something,

03:46.726 --> 03:49.646
if you don't do something,
people are going to keep dying, Alyssa.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.154
[Lecturer] "The needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few."

03:59.364 --> 04:02.909
It's not only a line from the single
greatest bromance in cinematic history,

04:02.992 --> 04:06.246
it is also an example
of what form of ethical thought?

04:07.997 --> 04:08.831
Anyone?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.377
Anybody? Nobody?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.797
Of course not, who needs ethics
when you got a trust fund?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.424
Notebook, come on.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.010
Don't leave me hanging.
I know you know the answer.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.512
Utilitarianism.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.472
Yes. And that is?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.683
[Jack]
The theory that the best action to take

04:26.766 --> 04:29.435
is the one that provides the most good
for the most people.

04:29.894 --> 04:30.853
Exactly.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.606
But utilitarianism requires

04:33.690 --> 04:35.942
that everybody
be on the same page, morally.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.111
And when was the last time that happened?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.446
Think about it like this.

04:40.738 --> 04:44.117
The many are vegetarians.
The few

04:44.617 --> 04:45.660
are cannibals.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.662
ETHICAL RELATIVISM

04:49.122 --> 04:50.581
That is an example of...

04:52.166 --> 04:53.001
Seriously?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.629
There are, like, 25 other people in here.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.298
I know. It's a new record.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.049
And yet, I'm asking you, Jerry.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.260
Jack.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.262
Ethical relativism.

05:05.054 --> 05:05.972
And that means?

05:07.515 --> 05:09.517
"To thine own self be true."

05:10.059 --> 05:11.227
Exactly!

05:11.311 --> 05:13.855
Be your own moral compass.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.609
[Lecturer]
Now, who wants to talk about motivation?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.986
Nobody? Awesome.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.322
Bi-pedal, huh?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.740
Most of the time.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.285
And... had a long snout? Short snout? What?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.579
Longish, mostly teeth.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.623
It was kind of hard for me to see
'cause he had his foot on my back.

05:39.088 --> 05:39.922
Something like that?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.008
Yeah.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.427
Something like that.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.096
Sounds like you've got yourself
a werewolf problem.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.724
[Jack] Just like that?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.225
Werewolf?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.853
-Well, you got another explanation?
-No.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.898
But I actually I saw it and I still
can't believe it. and you're all like,

05:56.981 --> 06:00.026
-Hey, Wednesday, it must be a werewolf.
-Magic, champ.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.028
You said it yourself.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.782
Did you know there was a string
of grisly murders

06:05.865 --> 06:07.658
right here in town back in the 90s?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.870
Never solved. Could be your werewolf.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.872
Why would a werewolf attack Neophytes?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.040
Mm.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.377
-The youngest meat is the sweetest.
-That's gross.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.878
And Neophytes are

06:18.961 --> 06:22.799
a very specific target, especially given
the amount of students on campus.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.719
Pete, we gotta find this thing.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.597
Or we...

06:31.557 --> 06:33.726
we could just let nature take its course.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.063
You're a bloodthirsty old man,
you know that?

06:37.146 --> 06:38.564
Yeah, it worked last time.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.982
That kid got...

06:41.025 --> 06:43.027
dead, very tragic but...

06:45.738 --> 06:46.739
you got in.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.243
This has nothing to do
with getting in, Pops.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.745
If I don't do something,
then I'm just another asshole

06:52.829 --> 06:54.664
that doesn't care about anyone
except himself.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.291
EDWARD COVENTRY TURNING MEDICAL
PHILANTHROPY ON ITS HEAD

07:04.382 --> 07:05.800
[gentle knock on door]

07:11.722 --> 07:14.559
[door clatters open]

07:18.855 --> 07:19.897
You asked to see me?

07:21.941 --> 07:24.110
[door clatters shut]

07:32.118 --> 07:34.579
Kyle told me quite the story

07:34.662 --> 07:36.581
about last night's test.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.668
Did a Neophyte claim to be attacked
by some kind of monster?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.420
He did.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.258
Was he drinking?
The freshmen have been known to drink.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.802
I believe he may be telling the truth.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.722
Or at least, he believes
he was telling the truth.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.226
Do you care to explain the reason
for the Olympic-level mitigation?

07:59.687 --> 08:00.730
This morning,

08:01.564 --> 08:04.192
I went to the graveyard and I found these.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.361
Circumstantial at best.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.363
I also...

08:10.615 --> 08:11.532
found this.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.788
We know that before she died,
Drea saw some kind of beast.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.585
There are reports of similar attacks,
dating all the way back to the 1800s.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.588
The description of this monster
matches what Jack...

08:27.548 --> 08:30.468
the Neophyte claimed he saw.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.346
THE BEAST IS BACK

08:33.429 --> 08:34.555
If it is...

08:35.431 --> 08:38.476
-a werewolf...
-Well, then this situation requires

08:38.559 --> 08:40.603
far more experienced practitioners.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.688
And we have those.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.529
Thank you, Magus.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.785
It's just--

08:55.868 --> 08:57.495
[door bangs shut]

09:15.054 --> 09:15.888
Shit.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.663
Don't think the hamburger's necessary.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.791
-What? Hamburger's not good enough for it?
-Yeah, Pops.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.835
I forgot to tell you,  a real snob.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.378
Prime rib or nothing.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.130
You keep it up.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.675
Well, then I won't give you this.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.678
[cocks gun]

09:55.970 --> 09:57.430
You want me to take a gun to school?

09:58.848 --> 10:01.767
-What? That's bad now?
-Do you watch the news ever?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.021
If you mean the mainstream media.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.981
Oh, say crisis actor, I dare you.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.149
I don't think--

10:09.108 --> 10:11.777
Besides... I'm fresh out
of silver bullets.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.781
I know a guy. We're good.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.867
[hasty footsteps]

10:17.950 --> 10:18.868
[door clicks]

10:37.136 --> 10:38.387
[Jack] Wish me luck, Mom.

10:55.863 --> 10:56.822
[sighs]

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
[snarling]

11:11.587 --> 11:12.463
The campus.

11:16.092 --> 11:16.967
[sighs]

11:36.570 --> 11:38.698
-[sound of laughter]
-That was actually great.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.574
Oh, shit!

11:41.117 --> 11:41.951
Jack?

11:44.578 --> 11:45.579
Amir, let's go.

11:47.915 --> 11:48.999
[Jack sighing]

11:49.375 --> 11:50.209
[Amir] Hey.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
Whoa, dude, it's me. It's Amir.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.006
This? Safety first.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.217
-We should get a selfie.
-No.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.636
Looks like congratulations are in order.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.098
You remember. I thought you were gonna be
like Todd, his memory just wiped.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.683
Well, congratulations, man.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.144
-You deserve it.
-Thank you.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.522
Amir, we're going to miss "appy hour."

12:12.189 --> 12:14.108
Oh, like happy hour.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.654
I didn't like everyone
in my Boy Scout troop either, so...

12:19.405 --> 12:20.239
Hey...

12:23.033 --> 12:25.286
did you happen to see a big dog
come through here?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.747
-What?
-Forget it.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.624
-You sure they didn't do something to you?
-No.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.754
Listen, Amir, do me a solid, though, okay?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.297
-What?
-Get back to your dorm.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.799
Whatever killed Weston and Drea
is still on the loose...

12:40.009 --> 12:41.385
and I like my friends not dead.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.720
Okay.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.430
I mean, not dead is preferred, so, yeah.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.307
Yeah, I'll get home.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.227
Dude, it really should've been you
who got picked.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.937
-At least it wasn't Gregory.
-Yeah.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.189
Peace.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.613
[female] God! My hair's deflated!
You're paying for--

13:00.696 --> 13:03.824
[male] Seriously, Amir. You have to stop
hanging out with that townie.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.207
[door clicks open]

13:12.416 --> 13:13.334
[door shuts]

13:16.295 --> 13:17.463
[Jack sighs]

13:25.971 --> 13:27.598
You look like I feel.

13:27.973 --> 13:28.974
Sorry to hear that,

13:29.433 --> 13:30.810
because I feel like death.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.353
I wonder if Weston...

13:33.229 --> 13:34.563
feels dead?

13:35.105 --> 13:37.733
-That's pretty cold, Clay.
-Dude, think about it.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.820
One minute, he's just across the hall.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.781
The next minute, he's gone.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.784
Makes you wonder
if he was ever really alive.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.203
-Yeah, Clay?
-After all,

13:49.411 --> 13:52.081
what do we really know about him

13:52.498 --> 13:53.833
before he showed up here?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.419
How do we even know
if he actually existed?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.214
How do we know if...

14:01.423 --> 14:04.552
any of us actually exists?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.011
Clay.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.973
Do you mind? I need some time alone.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.225
Cool.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.810
-Thanks
-Yeah.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.481
Emotions. Are they intense or what?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.488
-You want me to go? Oh, okay, I will go.
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:27.116 --> 14:27.950
[door shuts]

14:35.708 --> 14:42.006
[church bells ringing]

14:42.089 --> 14:45.509
[woman screams]

15:02.776 --> 15:05.279
[woman's voice]
Oh, my God, he's here! It's Amir!

15:10.034 --> 15:14.580
[sound of flies buzzing]

15:32.348 --> 15:33.933
[Jack] <i>And I like my friends not dead.</i>

15:34.058 --> 15:35.225
[Amir] <i>Not dead is preferred.</i>

15:43.901 --> 15:45.903
TODAY'S SPECIAL
TOMORROW'S OK

15:49.365 --> 15:52.117
-You're going to think I'm insane.
-Already there.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.871
I think I know what's killing everyone.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.541
Don't you mean "who"?

16:00.167 --> 16:01.585
No, definitely what.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.089
Oh, you mean, like, the weapon?

16:05.631 --> 16:08.342
What is it? Is it like a machete?
A parang?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.928
-A werewolf.
-Oh, a mythical creature.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.013
I've seen it, okay? It's chased me.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.933
Also, I've chased it,
which I think I need to do again.

16:17.768 --> 16:21.897
Dude, are you seriously asking me
on a werewolf hunt?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.400
And clearly, I'm the Mayor of Crazytown
and I'll be going.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.193
Because I am in.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.195
What if I'm wrong?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.488
Dude...

16:30.072 --> 16:31.323
what if you're right?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.914
-What's with all the hamburger?
-I don't know.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.374
Tradition.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.334
Okay, then meet me there.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
No, do not invite her, please.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.467
God, it's such a shit-hole.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.553
-Here we go.
-You'd think for what my parents pay,

16:52.636 --> 16:54.138
there'd at least be turndown service.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.182
No, there's not even a maid
or anything. That's--

16:58.183 --> 16:59.351
Excuse you!

17:00.060 --> 17:01.520
[Randall] Pretty badass, Morton.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.689
Using fellow students as bait.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.025
That's not what we're doing.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.569
We're not following
suspected pledges around,

17:08.652 --> 17:10.863
hoping a werewolf
will show up to kill them?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.197
Shit.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.700
[both] That's exactly what we're doing.

17:14.783 --> 17:18.287
-We need a better plan.
-Dude, trust me, this is a great one.

17:18.912 --> 17:19.997
[Randall] Go get her!

17:40.893 --> 17:43.020
[Jack gasps]

17:43.103 --> 17:44.313
Whoa, whoa, hey!

17:45.272 --> 17:46.482
-Alyssa?
-Okay.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.609
Jack, touch me again, I'll kick your ass.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.986
-Really?
-What are you doing here?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.780
The same thing as you, apparently.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.907
I told you we had this under control.
Go home.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.409
This is The Order's solution?
A single student?

17:59.453 --> 18:00.287
Oh, wait.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.122
Are you out here on your own?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.917
I can't let another person
get butchered, all right?

18:05.000 --> 18:05.876
Well, me neither.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.089
You want to help?
Keep an eye on Brandon.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.632
It's already taken care of.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.636
You brought someone else in? Who?

18:15.719 --> 18:17.387
Somebody that believed me.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.306
-I told you--
-Relax.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.642
I made up a story that Brandon
seemed depressed. It's fine.

18:22.017 --> 18:22.851
That's it?

18:23.936 --> 18:24.770
That's it.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.731
So, we'll team up?

18:29.608 --> 18:31.777
As long as you can improve
your surveillance game.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.237
Oh, my game is weak?

18:42.037 --> 18:42.996
Don't mess up.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.291
[Vera] We were foolish.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.585
I was foolish.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.171
I underestimated the threat.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.176
There is a creature out there,

18:56.927 --> 19:01.431
born or cursed by magic
that is tearing apart our recruits.

19:02.099 --> 19:02.975
Yeah.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.353
-It's hard to believe.
-Yes.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.109
Sometimes we don't want to see
what is right in front of us.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.322
[Vera] Magic swirls all around us.
It is in the air that we breathe.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.950
Please, do not be so naive

19:20.033 --> 19:23.036
as to think we are the only ones
who could harness its power.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.710
Find out everything you can about
werewolves. Especially how to kill one.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.504
-Silver--
-And God help the first one of you

19:32.588 --> 19:33.881
that says "silver bullets."

19:35.424 --> 19:36.675
Bull... bullfrogs.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.719
Shut up.

19:42.973 --> 19:43.849
[sighs]

19:44.725 --> 19:45.851
Excellent.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.563
What are you doing? Get to work.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.708
Why'd you pick Belgrave?

20:12.461 --> 20:15.088
Because my family lives on the West Coast.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.215
Okay.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.842
So, what else do you do
besides hate your family?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.677
I don't hate them.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.095
I just...

20:23.639 --> 20:24.765
don't want to be them.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.433
Come on. How bad can they be?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.937
Are you going to pretend
you haven't Googled me?

20:30.395 --> 20:33.774
I've been busy with secret societies
and monster hunting.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.691
Right.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.779
[Jack]
Tell me something true about yourself.

20:41.990 --> 20:42.866
Er...

20:46.119 --> 20:48.914
My real life started
when I was accepted into The Order.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.459
I was following my parents' playbook
until then.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.128
This is mine.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.133
What about you?

21:01.718 --> 21:02.636
What about me?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.223
Was Belgrave your idea, or are you
following someone else's playbook?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.645
Oh, she's heading into the house party.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.858
Wow. She's starting early.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.443
Yeah.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.280
Looks like a real classy event.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.865
Wanna head in?

21:24.783 --> 21:25.617
Mm...

21:26.785 --> 21:27.744
Let's hang back.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.289
-See how it plays out.
-Yeah.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.632
No.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.761
No, I will not move my fundraiser.
They can move theirs. Yes.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.346
Margaret.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.473
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.853
Thank you. You have yourself a lovely day.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.192
You expected this bag of herbs
to protect the Neophytes

21:59.318 --> 22:00.819
how, precisely?

22:01.236 --> 22:04.323
Ah, at the time, we were dealing
with an unidentified threat.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.659
-And now it's identified?
-I have an operating theory.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.747
The disciples are researching
more specific defenses as we speak.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.541
I'm sure the victims will be reassured
by your commitment.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.626
If only we could resurrect them
from the dead.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.795
Yes. If only.

22:19.171 --> 22:23.425
Now, unless there's anything else,
I do have a day job to attend to.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.970
By all means. I'm late for a call
with the Grand Magus as it is.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.390
He's very concerned,
especially after I explained to him

22:30.474 --> 22:33.435
how badly you bungled
this year's selection process.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.397
Mm. Well, each Neophyte,

22:37.689 --> 22:41.318
in their own way, displayed
the characteristics that we search for.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.488
And yet, here you are without
enough bodies to fill the slots.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.575
Not... at all.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.995
Given that your son, Gregory,

22:52.079 --> 22:53.914
was our first alternate,

22:53.997 --> 22:57.584
and that we now, unfortunately,
have an opening.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.002
-Tragic.
-Yes.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.546
-Tragic.
-But after all...

23:02.547 --> 23:04.925
who could have predicted
such terrible events?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.804
I hope you find your monster.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.265
-I'm sure we will.
-I'll see you at the initiation ceremony.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.982
[Alyssa] I think we've lost her.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.360
Maybe one of us should go around back.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.908
-Nope. There she is.
-Where?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.285
Porch. Oh, my God.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.623
[Jack] Ugh! She's eating his face.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.835
[girl laughs]

23:40.419 --> 23:42.796
Is that flirting in your world?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.298
That's not any kind of flirting.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.717
Sounds like I should be
taking pointers from you.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.386
-You wish.
-Sure do.

23:53.723 --> 23:54.891
[guy groans]

23:56.726 --> 23:58.645
-[guy wretches]
-[girl gasps]

23:58.728 --> 24:00.355
-[Jack gasps]
-[girl yells]

24:00.439 --> 24:01.565
Asshole!

24:03.400 --> 24:04.401
Move!

24:05.068 --> 24:07.070
Move! Ugh!

24:27.090 --> 24:31.136
[half-sobbing]

24:40.770 --> 24:41.813
[crying] Stupid.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.273
Just stupid.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.193
The girl can move.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.904
-Bars are open.
-Good point.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.994
Forget it, asshole. You lost your chance.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.872
-Who's that?
-[girl] This is an original Herndl!

24:58.955 --> 24:59.831
[snarls]

24:59.915 --> 25:02.250
You do not puke on a Hern--
[bang]

25:02.334 --> 25:03.376
Oh!

25:03.460 --> 25:06.296
[gasps for breath]

25:06.379 --> 25:08.089
[chokes and screams]

25:08.173 --> 25:10.300
[Jack gasps]
[smash]

25:10.926 --> 25:11.760
[girl gasps]

25:11.843 --> 25:13.428
[Jack gasps]

25:15.514 --> 25:17.390
[Jack] Ah! It's not human.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.433
I've got eyes!

25:19.518 --> 25:20.810
It doesn't!

25:20.936 --> 25:22.395
-[sound of knife blade]
-[crash]

25:22.479 --> 25:23.480
[Jack coughs]

25:25.190 --> 25:26.608
-[Jack coughs]
-[Alyssa gasps]

25:33.073 --> 25:35.075
[Alyssa gasps]

25:35.450 --> 25:36.826
[Alyssa chokes]

25:39.287 --> 25:43.041
[Jack groans]

25:44.501 --> 25:46.294
[Jack shouts]

25:47.379 --> 25:48.838
[female voice] <i>Return to me.</i>

25:49.464 --> 25:51.925
[hurrying footsteps]

25:52.050 --> 25:54.052
[Jack and Alyssa coughing]

25:58.181 --> 26:00.517
Ah! That was no werewolf.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.563
It wasn't human either.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.816
-Why did it just stop?
-I don't know.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.527
Look at this.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.279
It's mud.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.992
How the hell are we supposed to...
hunt a mud monster?

26:17.325 --> 26:18.326
We don't.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.120
Come on.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.957
Don't break up the band now.
We just fought our first monster together.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.500
Good night, Jack.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.211
[sound of metal]

26:29.212 --> 26:30.255
[Alyssa sighs]

26:30.797 --> 26:34.259
-[Jack] You think she's gonna be okay?
-[Alyssa] That thing went the other way.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.386
I guess it got what it wanted.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.139
-What do you think that is?
-That's what I have to figure out.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.307
Alone.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.142
At least, let me walk you back to campus.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.769
Or...

26:45.895 --> 26:47.522
I could walk you back.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.358
Okay, sure.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.243
Hey.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.538
Seriously, how come you didn't
magic that thing?

27:05.040 --> 27:07.208
I'm years away from that kind of skill.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.628
[Jack] Do you at least have a wand?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.212
Or a crystal ball?

27:11.671 --> 27:13.548
Tarot cards? A black cat?

27:14.382 --> 27:16.635
-You got nothing.
-[Alyssa] Ridiculous.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.520
[Randall] So, now it's a "mud monster?"

27:29.022 --> 27:31.232
I can't think of a better way
to describe it.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.694
Any idea what it is?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.279
Where it went?

27:36.780 --> 27:37.906
What it's after?

27:38.865 --> 27:42.327
-It kills pledges. That's all I've got.
-But what is it targeting you?

27:42.911 --> 27:44.162
You're not even a pledge.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.623
And why stop killing Gabrielle?

27:46.915 --> 27:50.085
That attack, it just petered out
like it didn't matter.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.796
Amir.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.006
Drea. Weston.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.719
They gotta have something in common.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.639
[male voice] I can't believe you got in.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.141
Seriously, you gotta have horseshoes
up your ass or something.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.811
-Well, luck had nothing to do with it.
-Shut up. Whatever.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.604
-Drinks are on you.
-Oh, yeah. Two.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.939
[bartender] Yeah, you got it.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.067
What if...

28:14.859 --> 28:16.319
What if they were being eliminated

28:16.403 --> 28:18.780
to make room for someone
who couldn't make it on his own?

28:20.699 --> 28:21.616
So...

28:22.701 --> 28:24.994
-you're the killer.
-Not me, dumb-ass.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.210
This place needs a VIP section.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.628
Wouldn't you say?

28:34.170 --> 28:35.255
You're telling me!

28:40.677 --> 28:42.804
WAKE UP DEAD IMPERIAL STOUT

28:43.722 --> 28:46.641
-[Alyssa] I think I know what it is.
-[Jack] I think I know who's behind it.

28:47.976 --> 28:51.646
It's a golem. Centuries-old magic
used to make anthropomorphic...

28:52.772 --> 28:55.400
-You know what that means?
-We go to the same school.

28:56.651 --> 29:00.155
The golem is created
from clay, mud, or metal.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.867
Its master bestows life with a magic word,
etched on the forehead.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.704
-And it must be hard to write in metal.
-Also, harder to erase.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.664
The word is what keeps the golem alive.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.374
So, who is it?

29:12.667 --> 29:15.754
Gregory. He was never
going to make it into The Order, was he?

29:17.088 --> 29:17.922
No.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.674
So, I think he created the golem

29:19.758 --> 29:22.469
and ordered it to kill Neophytes
until he got in,

29:22.802 --> 29:24.554
-which he did.
-Last night.

29:24.888 --> 29:28.016
Yeah. Which is why it didn't kill us,
or pursue Gabrielle.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.101
It was ordered to stand down.
Mission accomplished.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.019
No.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.898
No, Gregory couldn't do this. He couldn't
even finish his subservience test.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.566
You just said slap a mannequin together

29:36.649 --> 29:38.735
and scribble a magic word
on the forehead.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.612
Is that really what you heard?

29:41.404 --> 29:44.199
Wow. Besides, even if Gregory could do
this kind of magic,

29:44.282 --> 29:45.867
he thought he was a sure thing.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.994
That's true. He's pretty lazy.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.454
Okay.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.040
So, we track down the golem,
find out who created it,

29:52.123 --> 29:54.501
-destroy it, and then dinner and a movie.
-Jack.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.170
Too aggressive? Right.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.672
Aggressive openings aren't good.
Just the movie.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.301
The Order will stop this thing
and punish whoever's responsible,

30:03.384 --> 30:04.969
but you have to stay out of it.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.139
I just think it would make more sense
if we worked together.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.433
I need you to say it, Jack.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.352
-Seriously?
-Say the words.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.146
Okay.  I won't go look for the golem.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.733
-It's for your own safety.
-No worries.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.153
Now, all we're talking about is the nail
in the coffin of my life-long mission.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.781
-Mission?
-Mission, dream. Same thing.

30:26.908 --> 30:27.909
Okay.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.203
Well...

30:32.664 --> 30:33.540
take care.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.124
Yeah.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.085
You, too.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.466
"You, too." Dork.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.093
"Take care."

30:45.426 --> 30:46.261
Idiot.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.986
<i>Have you ever wondered why you exist?</i>

31:12.078 --> 31:15.081
<i>What do we really know about him...</i>

31:17.417 --> 31:18.877
<i>before he showed up here?</i>

31:19.335 --> 31:22.380
<i>How do we even know</i>
<i>if he actually existed?</i>

31:29.721 --> 31:32.599
<i>How do we know if any of us</i>

31:32.932 --> 31:35.184
<i>actually exists?</i>

31:41.733 --> 31:42.984
[door opens softly]

31:43.318 --> 31:44.152
Clay?

31:44.235 --> 31:45.069
[door shuts]

31:45.153 --> 31:46.195
Clay.

31:47.113 --> 31:49.699
I told you not to touch my shit.

31:51.743 --> 31:52.619
Sorry.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.957
I suppose I should probably thank you.
Because of you, I live again.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.500
I have a purpose.

31:59.876 --> 32:00.835
What did I do?

32:01.252 --> 32:03.463
You figured it out. But now...

32:04.172 --> 32:05.465
now, I have to kill you.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.100
-[metallic boom]
-[Jack gasps]

32:16.225 --> 32:17.226
Does it hurt?

32:17.977 --> 32:18.811
Death?

32:19.312 --> 32:22.023
No, I'm not trying to be a dick.
It's a legit question.

32:22.690 --> 32:25.443
Oh, you obviously can't answer me.
That makes sense.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.696
[muffled gasps]

32:28.821 --> 32:30.657
How long does it take humans to die?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.201
[muffled yells]

32:33.785 --> 32:35.787
Okay, now I feel
like you're just being a dick.

32:36.162 --> 32:41.084
[muffled yells]

32:42.543 --> 32:44.087
[crash of glass]

32:44.170 --> 32:50.218
[muffled yells]

32:52.720 --> 32:55.556
[muffled roars]

32:57.183 --> 32:59.227
[muffled yells]

32:59.310 --> 33:05.441
[muffled yells continue]

33:05.525 --> 33:06.776
[ringing sound]

33:08.111 --> 33:09.320
[thump]

33:09.404 --> 33:11.406
[sound of rubble falling]

33:11.614 --> 33:15.827
[Jack pants]

33:23.751 --> 33:24.836
[Vera] Gregory Crain.

33:25.378 --> 33:29.132
You have been summoned
by the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.384
Will you heed the call?

33:32.176 --> 33:33.011
I will.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.929
Take these, Acolyte,
and begin your service.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.305
[heavy thud]

33:46.232 --> 33:47.400
[Jack] There's your killer.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.360
He's a golem.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.070
His name is Clay.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.239
It's hilarious, right?

33:54.532 --> 33:57.326
Hopefully, you can use your magic
and figure out who made it

33:57.410 --> 34:00.538
because the way I see it, whoever
created that is the real monster.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.584
Also, you need to rethink
your secret door.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.795
[door rattles shut]

34:24.103 --> 34:25.188
[male voice] The head.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.111
And the messenger.

34:38.034 --> 34:38.951
[bird tweets]

34:48.961 --> 34:50.463
Who created you?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.215
Margaret Crain.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.716
[shocked murmurs]

34:56.135 --> 34:57.720
[Clay] Oh, hey, Jack. Hey, no hard--

34:58.096 --> 34:59.680
[ringing sound]

35:10.316 --> 35:11.442
Let go of me!

35:14.403 --> 35:15.530
You can't do this.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.493
I'm a member of the Gnostic Council,
you have no right!

35:24.622 --> 35:25.706
The son, too.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.461
I'm a legacy! Mom, you ruin everything!

35:32.505 --> 35:33.589
This is all your fault.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.551
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

35:37.051 --> 35:38.010
You have no right--

35:38.261 --> 35:39.262
[door shuts]

35:45.101 --> 35:48.312
It appears you've been summoned.
Will you heed the call?

35:51.941 --> 35:55.153
[Vera] This is the part where you say yes,
Mr. Morton.

35:57.738 --> 35:58.573
Yes.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.721
Jack Morton.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.936
With an entrance like that,
we'll be expecting great things from you.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.941
[Jack] He was right there and I just...

36:34.317 --> 36:36.360
stood there, looking like an idiot.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.613
My own dad didn't even recognize me.

36:38.696 --> 36:41.532
[Pete] Why would he?
He doesn't even know you exist.

36:42.116 --> 36:46.204
The Order was supposed to be our ace
in the hole, our weapon against him.

36:46.287 --> 36:49.373
And now he's my boss! And he knows magic.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.168
Pete... they're monsters.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.419
Mm.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.714
And then there are the real monsters.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.133
Yes!
That werewolf is still out there, too!

37:05.473 --> 37:06.599
It's gonna be okay, sport.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.185
I can't even think that.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.563
‘Cause from where I'm sitting, I'm boned.

37:15.107 --> 37:16.567
Then change your seat...

37:17.652 --> 37:20.029
because we just won this fucker.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.826
The whole reason for you getting
into The Order was to

37:26.285 --> 37:28.579
get you close to that son-of-a-bus driver.

37:31.749 --> 37:32.959
We thought, what?

37:34.460 --> 37:37.630
Five years for you to graduate
and use The Order's influence

37:37.713 --> 37:41.509
to place you in a job close to Coventry?
Here we are, two weeks in...

37:42.510 --> 37:44.804
you're already in the same room as him.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.140
We've got him right where we want him.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.478
And we're gonna make that asshole pay...

37:53.437 --> 37:54.772
for driving your mother...

37:56.399 --> 37:57.858
to suicide.

38:12.957 --> 38:13.958
Plus...

38:15.543 --> 38:17.044
you get to learn magic!

38:19.046 --> 38:19.880
Yeah.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.341
-Magic.
-Yeah.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.760
Fucking magic!

39:26.864 --> 39:28.282
Edward, please.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.619
What wouldn't you do for your son?

39:34.205 --> 39:37.583
Oh, I wouldn't put his needs or my own
above the needs of The Order.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.587
And I wouldn't put myself in a position
where I had to choose his fate.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.466
The Fenestrated Man,

39:46.050 --> 39:47.259
Morlock's Lament

39:48.177 --> 39:49.178
or Solomon's End.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.890
I... I can't choose.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.184
You can and you must.

39:57.019 --> 39:58.020
Pick one, or I will.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.150
The Lament.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.487
-Damn you, the lament.
-That's what I'd choose.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.531
The pain is excruciating,

40:08.906 --> 40:10.074
but death is quick.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.326
Morlock's Lament. You may proceed.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.248
-Clay, stop. I command you.
-He's not yours to command anymore.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.376
Edward, please.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.975
Tell me if this hurts, okay?

40:37.601 --> 40:41.063
[Margaret cries out]

40:41.147 --> 40:43.149
[Margaret screams]

40:53.033 --> 40:55.870
Nope. This is one of your stupider ideas.
