00:13.398 --> 00:15.665
Ok, sorry. We shall
start over again

00:15.896 --> 00:17.998
Alright. Hi everybody.

00:18.997 --> 00:21.564
This is gonna be the
beginning of our journey

00:22.430 --> 00:24.364
It's me, going to get
a little flashlight

00:25.263 --> 00:28.131
Little, but very very powerful

00:28.896 --> 00:29.931
Anyway, enough chatter

00:30.098 --> 00:31.861
Let me explain what
you're gonna see

00:31.863 --> 00:34.664
It will be me, my buddy Bart

00:35.398 --> 00:36.631
That crazy violent bastard

00:37.364 --> 00:38.397
And the whole bunch from Riga

00:38.399 --> 00:41.064
where we met while attending
the Erasmus program

00:41.831 --> 00:42.864
At least some of us...

00:44.365 --> 00:46.765
...in fact, Mandy came from the US for
some other reason I can't remeber

00:47.663 --> 00:48.364
Well, the thing is

00:49.330 --> 00:52.664
Gioia, the italian girl,
invited us to a castle

00:53.631 --> 00:56.165
lost in the woods,
in the North of Italy

00:57.364 --> 01:00.032
and she told us the place
is haunted

01:00.630 --> 01:01.932
by a witch

01:03.063 --> 01:04.631
Vanja went crazy for that

01:05.364 --> 01:06.697
he said we shouldn't go

01:07.897 --> 01:10.695
but it looks like he's pretty
curious about the whole thing

01:10.697 --> 01:12.797
he's studying to be a priest

01:13.430 --> 01:14.630
I must leave you now

01:17.364 --> 01:18.897
See you in Montemale

01:20.063 --> 01:21.864
It will be so much fun

weirdos

03:14.298 --> 03:17.096
Please John, you've gotta
put that thing down

03:17.098 --> 03:20.761
Hey, just relax, you know you're
far more presentable than that one

03:20.763 --> 03:22.794
You'll give a very good
impression, I'm sure

03:22.796 --> 03:24.762
They will be super-happy
getting to know you

03:24.764 --> 03:25.798
Listen, John, I...

03:27.231 --> 03:30.364
See? It's even on time,
although we're in Italy

03:31.230 --> 03:32.296
Prepare yourself. Quickly.

03:32.298 --> 03:33.861
Couldn't we just say "hello!"?

03:33.863 --> 03:36.697
No way. Go. Lean over there.

03:37.031 --> 03:38.032
there

04:46.763 --> 04:47.764
John

04:49.630 --> 04:52.363
Are you planning to bother us with
that thing for the whole trip?

04:53.796 --> 04:55.597
It's a pleasure to see you,
too, Gioia. How was your trip?

04:55.896 --> 04:56.561
Good

04:56.563 --> 04:57.830
Vanja, just hold this, please

04:58.664 --> 04:59.997
Bart, let me hug you

05:03.064 --> 05:04.197
How are you, man?

05:07.230 --> 05:08.628
I'm sorry, I don't smoke

05:08.630 --> 05:09.564
May I, miss?

05:17.364 --> 05:19.864
Guys, here is Eveline,

05:20.430 --> 05:22.198
my lovely girlfriend

05:24.664 --> 05:26.195
I just can't believe it

05:26.197 --> 05:28.661
I was going to ask her
out for tonight - Well done

05:28.663 --> 05:31.195
I couldn't help getting you
guys in touch with her

05:31.197 --> 05:34.698
I'm sure you will find
yourselves nicely together

05:35.730 --> 05:37.664
Alright, hi everybody

05:39.630 --> 05:43.698
I know it was supposed to be a reunion
trip between Erasmus friends, but

05:44.296 --> 05:45.564
John kept insisting

05:46.731 --> 05:48.795
I hope it won't be
a bother for you

05:48.797 --> 05:52.128
What are you talking about, Eve? If
you're with John, you're with us

05:52.130 --> 05:53.864
Oh, I already love you

05:55.864 --> 05:57.364
So what do you
think about her?

05:58.763 --> 05:59.896
...eventually that doesn't
concern you, I hope...

05:59.898 --> 06:02.894
John, please, it's only a
matter of time, you'll see

06:02.896 --> 06:05.931
...I will persuade you to
enter the seminary as well

06:06.796 --> 06:08.294
Oh yeah, you can count on that

06:08.296 --> 06:10.564
So guys, what shall we do?

06:11.430 --> 06:13.231
Alcohol shopping?

06:19.396 --> 06:20.830
Oh John, come on

06:24.163 --> 06:26.665
The most capacious
trunk of its type

06:28.430 --> 06:29.597
Best grip

06:31.631 --> 06:35.163
Best quality of the finish

06:38.130 --> 06:41.427
Reliability, endurance,
cost effectiveness

06:41.429 --> 06:45.564
Come for a free ride at
the nearest dealership

06:46.162 --> 06:46.794
Come on, John,

06:46.796 --> 06:48.263
we're leaving

07:09.430 --> 07:10.597
No way

07:11.831 --> 07:15.227
- you were actually shooting a video?
- Why surprised, Gioia?

07:15.229 --> 07:18.395
He's been chasing us with
that camera all the time

07:18.397 --> 07:20.260
he's quite a puzzling lad

07:20.262 --> 07:23.197
We were not being exactly
"rational" that night

07:23.930 --> 07:25.964
You too were so cute

07:38.696 --> 07:40.932
Listen here: Piemonte,
land of <i>masche</i>

07:41.864 --> 07:43.065
Land of... what?

07:43.663 --> 07:44.630
<i>masche</i>

07:45.530 --> 07:47.731
people who mumbles,
while casting a spell

07:48.631 --> 07:53.765
Apparently, this castle was one of the
historical residence of Joanna of Naples

07:54.329 --> 07:58.998
because this countries, as all being
part of the County of Provence

07:59.163 --> 08:01.227
belonged to the
Kingdom of Naples

08:01.229 --> 08:05.664
and Joanna was the last of its
name to rule over both territories

08:06.863 --> 08:09.664
eventually, rumours has it she
was quite an easy woman

08:09.831 --> 08:12.331
and therefore she
didn't have any heir

08:12.431 --> 08:14.131
but only lots of lovers

08:14.730 --> 08:15.698
Go, Joanna...

08:16.630 --> 08:18.260
she managed not to get trapped

08:18.262 --> 08:21.331
Truth is that she was a
very good female ruler

08:21.431 --> 08:22.897
and that's why

08:23.097 --> 08:25.427
they used to talk
behind her back...

08:25.429 --> 08:27.029
many resenting men

08:27.031 --> 08:28.428
Good, Gioia...

08:28.430 --> 08:29.762
you did your homework

08:29.764 --> 08:32.164
Oh-oh, "girl power"

09:05.830 --> 09:08.731
I wonder who did they expect
to see arriving at their door

09:09.931 --> 09:12.030
Maybe an innocent
family on vacation

09:13.630 --> 09:15.297
Poor kids, can you imagine how
scared they would be by them?

09:20.663 --> 09:22.263
John, hey, John

09:22.930 --> 09:23.931
come up here

09:24.397 --> 09:25.363
look

09:49.897 --> 09:50.897
This must be my room

09:54.229 --> 09:55.598
If that...

09:57.263 --> 09:59.264
if that makes you happy...

10:11.230 --> 10:14.298
He's saying that the
kitchen we've just seen...

10:15.664 --> 10:16.831
...was the kitchen
of a rich manor...

10:18.196 --> 10:21.564
...but now is just powered
by a gas tank, so...

10:22.196 --> 10:23.064
let's not...

10:26.663 --> 10:27.664
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..

10:28.262 --> 10:29.330
The door is closed

10:30.230 --> 10:31.730
...ok, this part is forbidden

10:33.097 --> 10:35.298
- ok ok
- this part only is for rent

10:39.363 --> 10:41.230
ok, the living room is here

10:59.130 --> 11:00.130
what's in there, John?

11:01.663 --> 11:04.564
I think they use to
have watchers here...

11:05.696 --> 11:08.030
- ...I see monitors...
- Monitors?

11:09.130 --> 11:10.730
...but I bet
they're not working

11:12.697 --> 11:15.164
Alright, the owner told me they were
planning to turn it into a resort

11:19.997 --> 11:20.997
Yes, sorry

11:34.663 --> 11:37.363
It's the old watcher's
lock out post...

11:38.263 --> 11:39.665
...but it's not in use anymore

11:42.029 --> 11:43.730
Thank you, mr...

11:50.796 --> 11:52.893
...you and your wife
have been very kind

11:52.895 --> 11:57.797
My friend Mandy, thanks you very
much and says you've been very kind

11:58.963 --> 12:00.364
We should take a
picture all together

12:00.664 --> 12:02.928
Mandy, maybe this
people don't want to...

12:02.930 --> 12:04.331
Oh come on,
don't be ridiculous

12:09.329 --> 12:10.330
Ok, perfect

12:11.063 --> 12:11.731
Ok, great, let's go

12:12.630 --> 12:13.564
Ok, you guys ready?

12:15.363 --> 12:17.163
Three, two, one...

12:22.863 --> 12:25.097
...oh my God, it's disgusting

12:26.663 --> 12:28.829
- ...I look terrible
- No, you don't

12:29.895 --> 12:31.964
And you Bart, you turned away

12:33.097 --> 12:35.264
Gioia you even closed
your eyes - Sorry

12:36.429 --> 12:37.330
I mean, come on,
let's take another one

12:37.963 --> 12:38.765
Ok... quick.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.963
Three, two, one...

12:53.631 --> 12:55.764
Yeah... that's a little better

12:56.796 --> 12:57.863
...wait

12:58.631 --> 12:59.564
what the...

13:04.364 --> 13:05.830
That's incredible...

13:06.997 --> 13:09.797
...whoever is missing
this panorama, up to me,

13:10.663 --> 13:11.829
doesn't even deserve to live

13:14.397 --> 13:18.097
Oh, oh, luckily this one
will escape my fury

13:19.763 --> 13:22.631
turn around so you won't
have to kill yourself

13:23.630 --> 13:24.630
Hey, please, we're
here just to have fun

13:25.330 --> 13:26.363
You know how it works, John...

13:27.564 --> 13:29.264
...if you wanna be romantic
you can't act like an idiot...

13:30.631 --> 13:31.698
...the two things just
don't go together well

13:33.429 --> 13:35.697
Couldn't we just avoid talkin' crap
and think about our plan for tonight?

13:37.262 --> 13:38.829
Ya, well said Bart,

13:39.430 --> 13:40.327
I'm gonna go get changed

13:40.329 --> 13:41.631
You look great even like this

13:42.697 --> 13:43.961
you know that, you beauty?

13:43.963 --> 13:46.164
Oh, John, you
understand nada...

13:46.763 --> 13:47.631
just, vanish

13:50.829 --> 13:52.928
I don't know... maybe I
should let it go, but...

13:52.930 --> 13:55.598
...it's that thought that
doesn't let me go

13:56.396 --> 13:58.564
I'm so curious about
understanding it

13:59.729 --> 14:02.597
it's just as if this
story concerns me

14:03.162 --> 14:03.997
Well, I can see that

14:05.130 --> 14:07.565
paths of temptation are
various and powerful

14:08.863 --> 14:11.597
but that's exactly why we
must prove we are stronger

14:12.429 --> 14:14.297
consciousness can help faith

14:15.664 --> 14:17.631
but there are also boundaries
you shouldn't go beyond

14:17.930 --> 14:18.364
What?

14:19.162 --> 14:20.327
guys, what are
you talking about?

14:20.329 --> 14:23.661
- I see, you did put 2+2 together, too, right?
- John, please

14:23.663 --> 14:25.096
Well, come on

14:25.830 --> 14:27.231
"forbidden wing",

14:27.963 --> 14:30.164
"Mr and mrs Di Napoli",

14:30.297 --> 14:32.264
- ...medieval Spice Girl
- Her name's Joanna

14:33.929 --> 14:36.727
Alright, alright, Joanna...
but who's she?

14:36.729 --> 14:38.394
we didn't really
get to know that

14:38.396 --> 14:40.630
You wouldn't really
"enjoy" discovering that

14:41.062 --> 14:45.128
...not you - not him, not
me, I'd say neither Mandy

14:45.130 --> 14:47.896
can we just stop that here?
How about that?

14:47.997 --> 14:50.261
It doesn't even involve
you, apparently

14:50.263 --> 14:53.897
If ever I'll get the opportunity
I couldn't help catching it

14:55.029 --> 14:57.630
that would be quite
a big discovery

14:58.663 --> 14:59.964
Maybe Bart is right, Vanja...

15:01.397 --> 15:03.597
just let it be: it's fairy
tales, only fairy tales

15:04.630 --> 15:05.727
Eve, what do you think?

15:05.729 --> 15:06.997
I don't know...

15:08.130 --> 15:10.297
I think you're missing
an amazing sunset

15:10.896 --> 15:11.764
Well said, Eve

15:12.663 --> 15:13.663
let's go, Mandy

15:15.029 --> 15:15.830
wait

15:16.930 --> 15:17.930
where's Mandy?

15:31.862 --> 15:32.863
Hello...

15:38.396 --> 15:40.564
Oh, very good, Bart

15:42.063 --> 15:44.630
I was just running
out of alcohol

15:50.196 --> 15:53.096
We shall thank you, Lord,
for all that you give us

15:53.830 --> 15:55.963
Gioia's pasta and...

15:56.429 --> 15:57.096
beer

15:57.696 --> 15:58.297
Yeah, sure...

15:58.896 --> 16:00.364
thank the Lord

16:04.695 --> 16:06.663
I wanted to thank you all

16:07.230 --> 16:08.364
thanks to everybody

16:09.097 --> 16:09.997
I love you and...

16:10.862 --> 16:12.696
I'm sorry for ruined your trip

16:13.963 --> 16:15.864
Don't say that.
Why should you?

16:16.629 --> 16:17.264
we love you, too

16:18.129 --> 16:19.629
I told you you'd be fine here

16:20.163 --> 16:21.164
you stubborn

16:24.963 --> 16:25.931
To Eve...

16:26.629 --> 16:28.930
let's chug it

16:30.696 --> 16:31.696
To Eve

16:32.695 --> 16:34.597
Hope you don't
mind if I swig it

16:35.696 --> 16:37.697
Hey, wait. Wait a minute

17:49.997 --> 17:52.697
Fuck it! Let's just go

17:55.730 --> 17:57.697
Let me show you a
little trick I learned

17:58.396 --> 17:59.663
from Gioia's fellow countrymen

18:00.729 --> 18:01.630
in Erasmus - What exactly
are you talking about?

18:03.296 --> 18:05.996
Everybody knows: italian
guys

18:07.230 --> 18:08.230
are the slickest

18:10.162 --> 18:13.964
Go on, Bart, I wanna see
what's behind that stupid door

18:16.129 --> 18:17.729
Thank you, Mandy, for this

18:18.430 --> 18:19.131
Where did you get that?

18:22.062 --> 18:25.298
So, this is definitely something
you don't learn on the Internet

18:26.262 --> 18:28.796
Learn on the Internet?
Oh my God

18:30.029 --> 18:31.629
what's the world coming through?

18:32.097 --> 18:32.797
Quiet

18:33.996 --> 18:36.930
This is definitely
interesting stuff

18:38.063 --> 18:39.864
<i>Cinéma direct</i>

18:41.363 --> 18:42.163
One

18:45.029 --> 18:45.797
Two

18:48.363 --> 18:49.363
Three

18:51.862 --> 18:52.863
Four

18:57.263 --> 19:01.864
everyone is ready to find out where
the ancient ghosts of this castle

19:02.730 --> 19:04.596
keep their cleaning tools?

19:08.130 --> 19:09.597
Freeze

19:11.030 --> 19:12.597
I'll go first

19:21.263 --> 19:22.664
It's been even too easy

19:24.230 --> 19:27.031
not a long time passed

19:27.763 --> 19:28.996
since the last one

19:29.795 --> 19:30.796
opened it

19:35.796 --> 19:39.664
And just like Indie
in the Temple of Doom

19:40.396 --> 19:42.596
here is our heroes

19:43.196 --> 19:44.563
moving forward

19:45.962 --> 19:47.362
in the darkness

19:48.396 --> 19:50.564
John, am I really the
one who as to be teased?

19:53.695 --> 19:55.297
What are you gonna
do with that, Mandy?

19:56.630 --> 19:57.297
Fashion advices
for black masses?

19:58.162 --> 19:59.663
Hey, that's not a bad idea

20:03.297 --> 20:05.564
Hey girls, look over there

20:06.330 --> 20:07.331
John

20:14.329 --> 20:16.131
What the hell

20:17.663 --> 20:19.394
...is this?

20:19.396 --> 20:20.797
An old book, John

20:22.163 --> 20:24.163
Cleaning tools, uh?

20:25.830 --> 20:28.031
What's this, Vanja?
Do you know that?

20:30.429 --> 20:31.597
It might be

20:35.862 --> 20:36.863
no wait

20:37.362 --> 20:38.230
What?

20:39.129 --> 20:41.030
Earlier Vanja talked about

20:42.262 --> 20:44.362
a book written by Joanna

20:44.463 --> 20:45.597
a cursed book

20:46.597 --> 20:48.829
Well, technically to be cursed
is not the book,

20:50.230 --> 20:51.897
but the ones who read it

20:53.130 --> 20:54.131
Very well

20:56.263 --> 20:59.564
we found out the
breakthrough for tonight

21:02.197 --> 21:04.097
Come on, Bart,
give it to Vanja

21:05.295 --> 21:07.130
so he can bother us
with a cursed sermon

21:10.695 --> 21:13.696
I won't read that book
and for sure not from here

21:14.929 --> 21:17.996
Alright, alright...
let's go back to the hall

21:18.895 --> 21:20.296
Yeah, let's go back

21:27.930 --> 21:29.231
Gioia, do not...

21:31.630 --> 21:33.597
...well it can't
really be, come on

21:34.362 --> 21:35.629
It's written in latin

21:40.630 --> 21:42.231
Then it could really be

21:43.396 --> 21:44.363
How do you know it's
written in latin?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.130
I studied it at school,
I can recognize it

21:48.261 --> 21:49.663
not that I remember
it so well, but

21:50.696 --> 21:52.263
I'd like to take a better look

21:54.663 --> 21:55.664
Jesus

22:01.795 --> 22:03.163
John, you jerk!

22:04.030 --> 22:05.730
keep your grabby hands off of me

22:17.163 --> 22:18.163
And...

22:19.362 --> 22:20.764
cut! Perfect

22:22.830 --> 22:25.564
And just like in
"Raiders of the lost ark"

22:26.930 --> 22:27.964
here's our villains
unveiling the cursed trunk

22:28.696 --> 22:29.630
Shut up, retard

22:30.795 --> 22:33.296
let's listen what Miss
Di Napoli has to say

22:34.296 --> 22:35.664
Quiet, you two

22:36.261 --> 22:37.997
let's create a nice mood

22:43.396 --> 22:44.931
Gioia, please

22:45.663 --> 22:46.263
I'll give it a try

22:47.130 --> 22:48.297
it seems quite simple but...

22:49.029 --> 22:50.596
Vanja, will you help me?

22:51.629 --> 22:52.863
I told you we shouldn't...

22:54.261 --> 22:55.363
Please, please I beg you,
just don't be a pain in the ass

22:57.662 --> 22:58.663
Ok

23:06.696 --> 23:09.630
<i>Upon this papers here,
I seal the memories</i>

23:10.663 --> 23:11.131
<i>of Joanna of Anjou</i>

23:12.463 --> 23:15.229
<i>sovereign of the Kingdom fo
Naples, who never got married</i>

23:16.395 --> 23:17.829
<i>and lived as a free
and happy woman</i>

23:19.228 --> 23:20.563
Correct, but...

23:21.663 --> 23:22.829
...I don't think it's a
good idea to go on

23:24.029 --> 23:26.564
What? Oh, come on, it
seems interesting to me

23:27.161 --> 23:27.795
hear this

23:29.830 --> 23:31.664
<i>My people keeps hating me</i>

23:32.695 --> 23:34.629
<i>and these lines are
dedicated to them</i>

23:35.429 --> 23:37.230
<i>so that they can
learn the...</i>

23:38.862 --> 23:39.863
...virtue?

23:40.695 --> 23:41.696
Yes

23:42.629 --> 23:43.696
...<i>virtue of gratitude,</i>

23:45.196 --> 23:47.097
<i>which they totally ignore,
as for their lack of wisdom</i>

23:48.929 --> 23:49.729
I see

23:50.629 --> 23:51.329
That's abusive words

23:52.496 --> 23:54.864
...go further, let's see if
she can scold them even more

23:55.997 --> 23:57.930
...<i>everyone of
them shall be cursed</i>

23:58.696 --> 23:59.696
<i>those who</i>

24:00.428 --> 24:01.563
<i>just for my habit</i>

24:02.762 --> 24:03.931
<i>of spending my time
behind these walls</i>

24:04.662 --> 24:05.630
<i>in solitude</i>

24:06.196 --> 24:06.863
<i>declared me a</i>...

24:08.062 --> 24:10.031
Vanja, this stands
for witch, right?

24:10.629 --> 24:11.664
I don't...

24:13.229 --> 24:14.229
Yes, Gioia, yes

24:15.228 --> 24:16.830
it's exactly as I feared

24:17.396 --> 24:18.564
Let's go further

24:19.428 --> 24:20.996
<i>...they declared
me a witch,</i>

24:22.095 --> 24:22.797
<i>spreading a bad
reputation about me</i>

24:23.696 --> 24:24.296
<i>in perpetuum</i>

24:25.929 --> 24:27.330
<i>I've been a good ruler</i>

24:27.663 --> 24:30.060
<i>but still they
weren't grateful</i>

24:30.062 --> 24:31.230
<i>shall them be cursed...</i>

24:31.395 --> 24:32.663
Gioia close that
book immediately

24:34.395 --> 24:36.697
or we will seriously regret that

24:37.996 --> 24:40.563
"or we will
seriously regret that"

24:41.128 --> 24:42.329
Vanja, please stop

24:43.063 --> 24:44.130
nobody follows you

24:45.630 --> 24:47.163
...<i>If my morals, as
they're defined loose</i>

24:47.295 --> 24:49.629
<i>have offended you
right to that point</i>

24:50.762 --> 24:51.663
<i>you shall than suffer
an equal injury</i>

24:53.129 --> 24:55.263
<i>beacause I'm not the one
who deserve your hatred</i>

24:55.428 --> 24:57.262
<i>but it's truly the
other way round</i>

24:58.128 --> 24:58.996
<i>Shall my anger fall...</i>

25:05.428 --> 25:06.597
Ok, monk

25:07.396 --> 25:08.997
Let's just let Joanna be

25:10.962 --> 25:14.162
But now you're dancing with me

25:15.161 --> 25:17.129
- Come on
- No, Gioia, please...

25:20.261 --> 25:21.262
Music

25:22.129 --> 25:23.664
I definitely cannot miss that

25:25.763 --> 25:28.163
Come on, come on,
Vanja, loosen up

25:28.762 --> 25:29.563
loosen up

25:36.762 --> 25:38.363
Shit, battery is dying

27:53.695 --> 27:54.696
wake up

27:55.696 --> 27:56.697
What the fuck!
Go away, go away!

27:57.795 --> 27:58.796
Good morning

27:59.663 --> 28:00.263
Let's go downstairs, come on

28:02.961 --> 28:04.229
Five more minutes

28:05.395 --> 28:07.262
Okay, than you'll give me an
explanation

28:08.629 --> 28:09.563
about the destination
for nightime wandering

28:10.428 --> 28:11.162
What are you talking about?

28:12.363 --> 28:13.728
Tonight I woke up, I
was awake for a while

28:13.730 --> 28:14.959
and you were not there

28:14.961 --> 28:16.159
Eve,

28:16.161 --> 28:19.597
maybe you don't know that,
but John is well known for his

28:20.162 --> 28:20.893
"nightime robberies"

28:20.895 --> 28:22.130
at the fridge

28:22.862 --> 28:24.259
They're just fantasies

28:24.261 --> 28:26.093
Did you get up on the
wrong side of the bad?

28:26.095 --> 28:28.962
Yes - Let me go check if
you left anything to drink

28:29.428 --> 28:30.296
Go, go

28:34.395 --> 28:36.362
Good morning, miss

28:38.128 --> 28:40.827
- Morning, Bart
- Morning

28:48.695 --> 28:49.995
What's up, guys?

28:51.695 --> 28:52.329
where is...

28:53.196 --> 28:53.996
Vanja is outside for a walk

28:55.062 --> 28:56.096
- do you want some?
- Why not

28:57.895 --> 28:58.895
John, listen to this

28:59.762 --> 29:01.129
You know, Gioia download some

29:02.261 --> 29:02.930
papers about the
story of the castle

29:03.662 --> 29:04.329
Wait... downloaded?

29:04.928 --> 29:05.362
Yeah, she did

29:06.495 --> 29:08.664
back at home... still no
connection here, don't worry

29:09.229 --> 29:10.963
Yeah... interesting...

29:11.796 --> 29:13.794
but

29:13.696 --> 29:15.030
I'm having breakfast now

29:16.161 --> 29:17.329
I found a text about
our friend Joanna

29:18.029 --> 29:19.029
It says

29:19.762 --> 29:20.763
she adored this place

29:21.996 --> 29:24.664
but local people thought
she was a <i>masca</i>

29:25.663 --> 29:26.930
which means
<i>witch</i>. remember?

29:27.428 --> 29:28.195
and

29:28.795 --> 29:29.630
apparently

29:30.363 --> 29:31.363
she used to

29:32.095 --> 29:33.329
bring her lovers here

29:34.196 --> 29:35.995
to drive them crazy in love

29:37.195 --> 29:38.596
And one of them,
named Caracciolo,

29:39.395 --> 29:40.828
lived here with her
for a few years

29:41.696 --> 29:43.063
except she sudden left him once

29:44.696 --> 29:45.995
and he jumped out the window,
as he couldn't stand the pain

29:47.428 --> 29:49.696
...and the Queen got quite
hit by his extreme actions

29:50.696 --> 29:52.859
rumours say she
still around here

29:52.861 --> 29:53.963
remorseful,

29:55.128 --> 29:56.730
looking for a body to possess
in order to

29:57.629 --> 29:58.629
come back to life

29:59.595 --> 30:01.263
and to get back to the
feelings she used to get

30:01.861 --> 30:02.630
Right...

30:03.362 --> 30:04.062
how do you know that?

30:05.428 --> 30:06.597
Don't you remember?

30:07.894 --> 30:09.564
I am a powerful clergyman!

30:12.861 --> 30:14.664
No, I... I've studied,
too, you know

30:16.261 --> 30:17.762
Well... shall we eat, though?

30:20.662 --> 30:21.596
thanks for cooking, Bart

30:27.395 --> 30:28.962
what's the plan for tonight?

30:39.630 --> 30:41.663
well, maybe, it's an
electrical contact

30:45.395 --> 30:46.863
...or maybe,

30:48.696 --> 30:49.896
is Joanna calling?

30:50.762 --> 30:51.963
what do you think, Vanja?

30:58.662 --> 31:01.663
Joanna's calling!

31:02.629 --> 31:04.329
will you answer that?

31:12.828 --> 31:14.729
you're not as funny
as you once were

31:15.630 --> 31:16.230
you shitty priest

31:17.662 --> 31:18.663
farewell

31:27.630 --> 31:28.263
Bart

31:34.128 --> 31:35.728
I couldn't help
thinking about you

31:36.363 --> 31:36.996
what can I do?

31:37.829 --> 31:38.829
I don't...

31:39.428 --> 31:40.296
All these years

31:41.061 --> 31:41.896
so many times, I...

31:43.395 --> 31:46.596
I realized that I can't really
get that night out of my mind

31:48.028 --> 31:51.029
Gioia, you know, what happens
in Erasmus there remains

31:52.261 --> 31:53.564
How can you say that?

31:54.661 --> 31:56.063
you're lying to yourself
and you know that

31:56.162 --> 31:57.628
We already talked
about it, ok?

31:57.630 --> 31:59.695
Yeah, we talked
about it on Skype

32:04.261 --> 32:06.962
I wouldn't say you
would have the courage

32:07.095 --> 32:09.195
to tell me the same
things in person

32:11.395 --> 32:13.262
John! Mind your own business

32:13.862 --> 32:15.196
Ok, I'm sorry

32:16.329 --> 32:18.629
It's just that I was
getting into it

32:21.828 --> 32:22.828
I don't know...

32:23.395 --> 32:24.329
If... this place...

32:25.228 --> 32:27.229
maybe... we should just go away

32:28.695 --> 32:30.563
That won't happen

32:31.662 --> 32:32.759
Gioia, I understand
your point, but

32:32.761 --> 32:34.693
we have two more days here

32:34.695 --> 32:35.729
it's not a long time

32:36.695 --> 32:37.693
let's enjoy

32:37.695 --> 32:39.126
You're right, but, Vanja...

32:39.128 --> 32:39.963
Vanja...

32:40.862 --> 32:41.963
...don't mind Vanja's words

32:42.729 --> 32:44.696
curses just don't exist

32:45.629 --> 32:46.629
It's us that a...

32:48.262 --> 32:49.329
...that actually exist

32:49.929 --> 32:50.696
Well said!

32:51.961 --> 32:52.962
And me...

32:53.829 --> 32:54.930
I still got to shoot something

32:56.196 --> 32:57.196
and so...

32:58.396 --> 32:59.363
cut!

33:00.261 --> 33:01.259
Hello guys!

33:01.261 --> 33:04.026
Unfortunately there's no
internet connection here

33:04.028 --> 33:07.695
so you're gonna see this once
I'll get back to the 21st century

33:08.694 --> 33:09.663
So

33:11.229 --> 33:11.862
If

33:12.894 --> 33:14.226
you end up in a place like this

33:14.228 --> 33:18.193
remember not to bring a furnished
collection of clothes with you

33:18.195 --> 33:21.129
because no one is gonna
rightfully evaluate it

33:21.961 --> 33:22.760
If

33:22.762 --> 33:23.829
and I'm saying "If"

33:24.396 --> 33:25.363
you get the chance to

33:26.228 --> 33:28.628
spend a nice evening, with

33:29.195 --> 33:30.029
quite an atmosphere

33:31.162 --> 33:33.194
no one is gonna notice
what belt you wear

33:33.196 --> 33:36.195
or if you wear a even or
odd number of bracelets

33:37.128 --> 33:38.930
Yeah, that's quite a drama!

33:41.996 --> 33:42.996
Ok, good

33:44.129 --> 33:45.729
let's see what you're
able to do, bud

33:46.396 --> 33:47.563
Understand?

33:48.761 --> 33:50.696
even if we achieve great
results through science

33:51.628 --> 33:53.562
how do we know
how it is generated?

33:54.329 --> 33:55.796
the source must be supernatural

33:56.661 --> 33:57.727
beyond human comprehension

33:57.729 --> 33:59.061
I understand, but

33:59.063 --> 34:03.162
If there were a god, don't you think
he would show up a little more?

34:03.262 --> 34:06.360
God already shows up

34:06.362 --> 34:08.695
but the eyes we need to see him

34:09.261 --> 34:10.661
are not these ones

34:11.996 --> 34:13.629
they are these ones

34:14.628 --> 34:15.929
and then these ones

34:16.129 --> 34:18.426
Well done, Vanja!
Now I figured it out

34:18.428 --> 34:20.293
it's all about picking up girls

34:20.295 --> 34:22.393
Don't be silly, John,
we were just talking

34:22.395 --> 34:24.759
okay? Mind your own
business instead

34:24.761 --> 34:25.762
Why would you...

34:28.661 --> 34:29.695
What's up, John?

34:31.960 --> 34:32.962
I can hear noises

34:34.962 --> 34:35.962
Noises?

34:36.395 --> 34:37.297
from where?

34:38.695 --> 34:39.696
As if they were...

34:40.428 --> 34:41.362
...behind the wall

34:47.161 --> 34:48.562
that's us, Eve

34:49.829 --> 34:51.696
that's us, last night

34:52.828 --> 34:53.995
What the fuck?

34:54.996 --> 34:55.996
Let's go see

34:56.728 --> 34:57.362
Vanja, you come with us

34:59.629 --> 35:00.629
Quiet

35:01.628 --> 35:02.629
wait...

35:03.695 --> 35:05.096
I'll take off the headphones

35:11.695 --> 35:12.728
can you hear that?

35:15.362 --> 35:17.595
they come from behind that door

35:18.861 --> 35:20.963
Well, yes... I think so

35:22.128 --> 35:23.895
Yes, they can
hear, John, go on

35:33.629 --> 35:34.863
What the fuck is going on?

35:39.396 --> 35:40.562
right...

35:41.427 --> 35:42.595
...it's us

35:43.129 --> 35:43.961
sleeping

35:45.328 --> 35:46.763
Old monitors not in
use anymore, uh...

35:48.427 --> 35:49.762
that old bastard!

35:52.929 --> 35:54.230
What's wrong with the picture?

35:55.095 --> 35:56.662
it looks like it's trembling

35:58.662 --> 36:01.230
somebody is
fast-forwarding it, buddies

36:02.395 --> 36:03.963
what's the meaning of all this?

36:08.629 --> 36:09.562
are they spying on us?

36:20.328 --> 36:21.929
Wait. What is that shadow?

36:25.062 --> 36:26.360
I've got an idea

36:26.362 --> 36:27.663
What do you mean?

36:30.095 --> 36:31.096
Nothing

36:34.695 --> 36:36.130
I told you you woke up

36:40.828 --> 36:41.829
What?

36:43.427 --> 36:44.995
I can't remeber that

36:48.695 --> 36:49.696
I...

36:54.427 --> 36:55.662
Eve...

37:04.328 --> 37:05.329
Eve...

37:06.061 --> 37:06.828
listen to me, please

37:08.196 --> 37:09.596
my love, listen to me, please...

37:21.062 --> 37:22.996
I have no memory of that

37:23.427 --> 37:24.261
I swear!

37:24.761 --> 37:26.425
John always acts
like the idiot he is

37:26.427 --> 37:27.459
it's not your fault

37:27.461 --> 37:30.259
I really don't understand
your stupid idea, but

37:30.261 --> 37:32.595
we have a bigger problem now

37:33.162 --> 37:33.795
And what is that?

37:34.829 --> 37:36.595
Why is the oldie spying on us?

37:37.229 --> 37:38.696
Hey, wait...

37:39.661 --> 37:40.662
what is that?

37:49.096 --> 37:49.895
Gioia, I thought...

37:50.628 --> 37:51.095
Nightwalking, uh?

37:52.096 --> 37:53.729
how about getting some sleep?

37:55.628 --> 37:56.629
There's more of a problem

37:57.095 --> 37:57.995
look

37:58.995 --> 38:00.095
I have to protect you, Gioia

38:00.962 --> 38:01.792
You said we shouldn't read it!

38:01.794 --> 38:02.994
Ok. I don't wanna
be here anymore!

38:02.996 --> 38:04.260
let's go back to the hall

38:04.262 --> 38:05.296
Let's go back

38:21.628 --> 38:23.229
What were you
planning to do, Vanja?

38:23.829 --> 38:24.793
I can't see that

38:24.795 --> 38:25.727
You should, instead

38:25.729 --> 38:27.663
I explained that to you

38:28.362 --> 38:29.193
you must face those things

38:29.195 --> 38:30.628
you can't just let them go

38:31.362 --> 38:32.260
there's no way out

38:32.262 --> 38:34.193
So why did you ask
to stop reading it?

38:34.195 --> 38:36.326
Because I thought we
still had the chance to...

38:36.328 --> 38:37.492
Guys, what are
you talking about?

38:37.494 --> 38:41.595
- me and Mandy - am I right Mandy?
- we just can't understand

38:42.095 --> 38:43.096
once in a while

38:43.829 --> 38:44.596
I feel the same as her

38:45.794 --> 38:46.996
Oh, did I hurt you?

38:53.795 --> 38:54.796
Gioia's right

38:55.795 --> 38:57.062
Vanja had as fooled

38:57.795 --> 38:58.393
Yeah, that's the point

38:58.395 --> 38:59.696
I didn't!

39:00.395 --> 39:00.996
I just wanted to save us, but

39:02.228 --> 39:03.229
seeing what happened tonight

39:04.095 --> 39:05.627
I'm afraid is actually too late

39:05.629 --> 39:06.496
What do you mean?

39:07.629 --> 39:09.259
I think what happened
between you and John

39:09.261 --> 39:11.030
it's not really your fault...

39:11.694 --> 39:12.695
nor his

39:13.829 --> 39:14.930
it's the Book

39:16.128 --> 39:17.129
Yeah, right

39:17.996 --> 39:18.663
how didn't I think about it?

39:19.762 --> 39:21.130
whenever I'd get caught
in bed with a girl

39:21.729 --> 39:22.596
I can always say

39:23.161 --> 39:23.762
it's because of a Book

39:24.661 --> 39:25.628
that's clever, Vanja

39:26.662 --> 39:27.763
Quiet Bart, Eve and John
are still arguing...

39:29.428 --> 39:30.926
Hey, hey, I was only
teasing him, ok?

39:30.928 --> 39:32.029
Eveline

39:32.629 --> 39:33.260
a great power

39:33.262 --> 39:34.926
is sealed inside the book

39:34.928 --> 39:37.595
a power that
can take control of our actions

39:38.629 --> 39:39.696
You're just a lier, a cheat

39:40.261 --> 39:41.258
how can you defend him?

39:41.260 --> 39:43.094
I wouldn't believe you'd
like that retard so much

39:43.096 --> 39:44.093
I don't

39:44.095 --> 39:45.762
I know what I'm talking about

39:46.628 --> 39:47.261
we should all be aware...

39:47.862 --> 39:48.696
Right, well

39:49.395 --> 39:50.361
I'll show you how aware I am

39:55.695 --> 39:57.195
Eveline, please, don't do that

39:58.228 --> 39:58.963
- I cannot force you to...
- <i>I...</i>

40:00.161 --> 40:00.762
<i>...Joanna of Anjou,
I shall curse you</i>

40:01.861 --> 40:03.695
<i>you fools, you means,
you miserables</i>

40:04.695 --> 40:05.329
<i>I dedicated to
you my life</i>

40:06.429 --> 40:07.295
<i>and my sweat... and
that's how you reward me</i>

40:08.428 --> 40:09.130
<i>You will pay
your blood price</i>

40:10.327 --> 40:11.095
<i>that will continously
flow from your veins</i>

40:12.227 --> 40:13.595
<i>my name will echo
in your ears</i>

40:14.794 --> 40:15.295
<i>Joanna of Anjou,
Joanna of Naples</i>

40:16.028 --> 40:16.663
<i>Joanna "masca"</i>

40:18.962 --> 40:20.659
Vanja, what did she read?

40:20.661 --> 40:21.762
what's going on?

40:21.928 --> 40:23.863
It's a curse, it's
a terrible curse

40:30.662 --> 40:31.963
- Are you alright?
- Yes

40:32.828 --> 40:34.059
- Curse, uh?
- Yeah

40:34.061 --> 40:35.262
Bullshit...

40:36.428 --> 40:37.595
it must have happened
something outside

40:43.294 --> 40:44.828
I'm really sick of you

40:45.795 --> 40:47.763
just go to hell,
all of you

42:32.828 --> 42:33.829
Eve...

42:34.628 --> 42:35.361
are you there?

42:36.427 --> 42:37.595
would you let me in?

42:43.094 --> 42:44.762
how about you
coming down to eat?

42:45.628 --> 42:47.195
everybody is seated and ready

42:47.894 --> 42:48.895
No

42:50.629 --> 42:51.629
Well

42:53.195 --> 42:55.062
I could say you would have liked
to be on your own for a while, so

42:56.061 --> 42:57.629
I brought you something to eat

42:58.862 --> 42:59.862
can I come in?

43:00.695 --> 43:01.728
Just go away

43:57.895 --> 43:58.896
Nothing

43:59.995 --> 44:01.596
she won't come downstairs

44:03.894 --> 44:06.094
no moving scene

44:07.160 --> 44:09.061
narrating the big...

44:11.662 --> 44:12.663
...Eve's return

44:16.195 --> 44:17.094
Stop

44:19.894 --> 44:21.795
I know I'm gonna
regret this, but

44:22.761 --> 44:23.762
just keep the camera on

44:25.729 --> 44:27.596
we should create
a nice atmosphere

44:28.161 --> 44:29.262
What do you mean?

44:30.395 --> 44:32.563
Let's just forget
this bad moment

44:33.160 --> 44:34.628
it's us five

44:35.194 --> 44:36.329
as it was in Riga

44:37.661 --> 44:38.562
and this is definitely
something to record

44:39.195 --> 44:40.195
But... I...

44:41.961 --> 44:42.961
Eveline

44:43.829 --> 44:45.029
she's all alone in her room

44:45.227 --> 44:47.093
You can't really
do anything, John

44:47.095 --> 44:50.159
I'll have to figure out
what trouble did she got in

44:50.161 --> 44:51.961
by reading that page of the Book

44:53.127 --> 44:54.195
Vanja, stop this
nonsense and shut up

44:55.362 --> 44:57.128
Right, isolation
is not good for her

44:57.728 --> 44:58.729
nevertheless

44:59.427 --> 45:01.194
we need to wait the right moment

45:02.060 --> 45:03.128
to break it, in the right way

45:04.661 --> 45:05.729
it won't be only a matter
of time, I'm afraid

45:07.227 --> 45:08.228
Yes, but

45:09.095 --> 45:09.796
we shall not do it right now

45:10.695 --> 45:11.696
Bart's right

45:13.094 --> 45:14.762
we should enjoy the night

47:20.629 --> 47:21.858
What do you want?
Leave me alone

47:21.860 --> 47:22.859
What's wrong with you?

47:22.861 --> 47:23.895
Have you watched, Bart?

47:24.961 --> 47:26.662
Mandy, John...
after what happened...

47:27.094 --> 47:27.760
it's so wrong

47:27.762 --> 47:28.828
It's always been like this

47:29.928 --> 47:31.296
far worse things happened in
Erasmus, you know that

47:31.760 --> 47:32.595
Worse?

47:34.960 --> 47:36.393
now we come to this very point

47:36.395 --> 47:40.259
you don't even want to pretend that
was something nice to remember

47:40.261 --> 47:41.828
I didn't mean that, Gioia

47:43.227 --> 47:44.228
it's us

47:44.893 --> 47:45.858
us five

47:45.860 --> 47:46.894
like in the past

47:47.760 --> 47:48.528
and it's a good thing, right?

47:49.827 --> 47:50.727
Not everything
is exactly the same

48:18.161 --> 48:19.762
John, come on, stop it

48:21.860 --> 48:22.662
hey guys

48:23.661 --> 48:24.563
come over here,
all of you

48:25.793 --> 48:26.794
smile

52:26.727 --> 52:27.728
Gioia

52:28.628 --> 52:29.262
what are you doing here?

52:30.161 --> 52:31.162
is everything alright?

52:32.027 --> 52:33.627
That's just what was missing

52:34.828 --> 52:37.192
couldn't you give a hand instead
of causing me a stroke?

52:37.194 --> 52:39.694
I'm sorry, I didn't
want to scare you, I just...

52:40.661 --> 52:41.694
wanna be quiet

52:42.427 --> 52:43.594
Quiet?

52:44.927 --> 52:46.561
have you heard all this noise?

52:47.160 --> 52:48.061
What noise?

52:49.160 --> 52:50.161
Do you mean...

52:50.961 --> 52:52.928
The piano, the radio

52:55.760 --> 52:57.361
I heard nothing, Gioia

52:59.295 --> 53:00.795
How about you being
awake, though?

53:02.160 --> 53:03.561
did you go back to
the forbidden wing?

53:04.027 --> 53:04.695
What?

53:08.194 --> 53:09.561
you still don't get it...

53:11.728 --> 53:12.560
What should I get?

53:13.927 --> 53:15.761
Vanja, I don't like
what's going on here

53:17.027 --> 53:19.059
maybe Eveline shouldn't
be coming with us

53:19.061 --> 53:20.195
Do not blame Eveline

53:21.061 --> 53:23.062
hatred must not be fed

53:24.628 --> 53:25.762
I've never said

53:26.693 --> 53:27.694
I hate her

53:28.261 --> 53:29.561
do I look like I could?

53:30.727 --> 53:31.929
I just said

53:33.628 --> 53:35.628
she's not good for the
balance of the group

53:36.195 --> 53:36.828
Oh, it's not only that

53:37.861 --> 53:39.728
we could have caused some...

53:40.628 --> 53:41.195
derangement, here

53:42.628 --> 53:44.662
there are forces that are
actually trying to...

53:45.294 --> 53:46.695
...arise and we just...

53:47.694 --> 53:48.694
...tickled them

53:49.394 --> 53:51.029
You scare me this way, Vanja

53:53.360 --> 53:54.661
Just trust God...

53:55.426 --> 53:56.594
Gioia

53:57.327 --> 53:58.327
it's so simple

53:59.627 --> 54:00.628
Maybe it's so simple,

54:01.326 --> 54:03.128
maybe we should just go away

54:04.693 --> 54:06.594
It's not a solution, we
can try indeed, but...

54:07.693 --> 54:09.296
We've awaken something

54:10.161 --> 54:11.261
that won't leave us so easily

54:12.128 --> 54:13.262
it will follow, everywhere

54:14.160 --> 54:15.161
until we face it

54:16.860 --> 54:19.161
what are you talking
about, Vanja?

54:19.928 --> 54:21.562
Actually

54:22.294 --> 54:23.595
I'm too tired
to understand it

54:25.994 --> 54:27.295
Take some rest,

54:28.027 --> 54:29.162
you might need it

54:31.161 --> 54:32.095
Ok

54:32.694 --> 54:33.695
see you tomorrow

54:36.293 --> 54:37.294
Night, Gioia

55:58.394 --> 55:59.562
Bart

56:00.693 --> 56:01.694
hey, buddy

56:02.128 --> 56:02.862
are you awake?

56:14.628 --> 56:15.661
What's going on, John?

56:16.394 --> 56:17.661
Don't you hear that?

56:19.960 --> 56:20.894
John,

56:22.027 --> 56:24.161
I was going to smash
your face once, remeber?

56:25.193 --> 56:26.194
and I should have

56:27.861 --> 56:29.261
ok, good, you got it

56:31.061 --> 56:33.995
now, why the hell you wanna
start from where we left?

56:36.628 --> 56:37.929
I suggest you to put
that...

56:38.827 --> 56:40.160
evil toy down
and go away

56:40.827 --> 56:41.827
understand?

56:42.294 --> 56:43.295
Quiet

56:44.995 --> 56:45.961
can you hear that?

56:49.794 --> 56:50.795
What the hell...

56:51.426 --> 56:52.392
Let's go, Bart

56:52.394 --> 56:53.661
I wanna find out what it is

56:54.394 --> 56:55.129
It must be Vanja

56:56.693 --> 56:59.761
apparently monks are worse than
priests at making sick jokes

57:00.361 --> 57:01.095
Oh, come on

57:08.728 --> 57:09.728
still nothing...

57:10.326 --> 57:11.193
what the hell

57:12.661 --> 57:13.661
Are you happy now?

57:21.060 --> 57:22.627
Doesn't it look odd to you?

57:23.193 --> 57:23.894
nobody's upstairs

57:25.794 --> 57:26.595
No

57:27.727 --> 57:29.327
it doesn't look "odd" to me

57:30.159 --> 57:31.160
it's the wind

57:31.627 --> 57:32.594
Right

57:33.326 --> 57:34.594
or maybe some giant bird

57:35.893 --> 57:37.694
just nested upon the
chandelier support on the wall

57:38.194 --> 57:39.128
Yeah...

57:39.728 --> 57:40.662
giant bird

57:43.226 --> 57:44.961
John, I'm going back to bed

57:47.160 --> 57:48.193
I know that...

57:49.327 --> 57:50.695
...that thing
is not comfortable

57:51.259 --> 57:52.027
but I don't give a shit

57:53.259 --> 57:54.628
so I advice you to do
the same thing

57:55.393 --> 57:56.360
good night

58:41.059 --> 58:42.093
<i>So...</i>

58:43.660 --> 58:45.861
<i>even our Spielberg,
here, fell in the trap</i>

58:47.426 --> 58:49.093
<i>he wakes me up in the
middle of the night</i>

58:49.960 --> 58:50.695
<i>for a swinging chandelier</i>

58:51.393 --> 58:52.160
<i>does it make any sense?</i>

58:55.693 --> 58:57.561
Who the hell is
having fun behind us?

58:57.860 --> 58:58.294
Him

58:58.761 --> 58:59.194
John

59:00.027 --> 59:00.661
you know

59:01.693 --> 59:02.261
you're the first suspect, right?

59:02.927 --> 59:03.562
- Me?
- Yeah

59:04.127 --> 59:04.828
I am the victim

59:05.995 --> 59:06.929
I have to sleep
in that fuckin'...

59:07.660 --> 59:08.661
shit, what a stiffneck

59:09.361 --> 59:10.825
But I swear is not even Vanja

59:10.827 --> 59:11.962
- Are you sure?
- Yeah

59:13.094 --> 59:13.991
- Hey
- John

59:13.993 --> 59:14.992
Shut up

59:14.994 --> 59:16.662
Hey, Vanja

59:17.260 --> 59:18.324
what do you say?

59:18.326 --> 59:20.659
how do you explain all the
things that happened?

59:20.661 --> 59:21.562
What do you want, John?

59:22.661 --> 59:23.728
- Just leave me alone
- No, I won't

59:25.327 --> 59:27.727
I wanna know what your God
would say about these jokes

59:29.159 --> 59:31.058
I bet you're one of
those, aren't you?

59:31.060 --> 59:31.991
Those?

59:31.993 --> 59:33.991
Yeah, right:
those who?

59:33.993 --> 59:35.594
Those ones who hear the voices

59:35.695 --> 59:38.292
and carry out
supernatural orders

59:38.294 --> 59:41.061
like Joanne d'Arc, just
to stay among "Joannas"

59:41.861 --> 59:42.862
Come on, guys

59:43.727 --> 59:44.993
there must be an explanation

59:45.861 --> 59:47.061
either John is a retard,

59:47.794 --> 59:48.827
either John is stupid

59:49.393 --> 59:50.024
it's quite simple

59:50.026 --> 59:50.725
Hey now, you listen to me

59:50.727 --> 59:52.158
I can't let you say this things

59:52.160 --> 59:53.659
ok? I'm not stupid

59:53.661 --> 59:54.627
- I'm...
- Stop!

59:55.260 --> 59:56.261
stop it, you two

59:56.994 --> 59:58.094
stop it everybody

59:58.994 --> 59:59.994
you mustn't fight

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:01.929
you'll make things worse

01:00:03.327 --> 01:00:03.961
Vanja, we're trying to
overcome our fears, don't...

01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:05.294
You don't get it

01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:07.060
nobody does

01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:09.360
I have to go

01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:10.792
Where?

01:00:10.794 --> 01:00:11.726
I go

01:00:11.728 --> 01:00:14.261
where I can stay in
peace, together with God

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:15.960
I go praying

01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:18.625
as you all should do,
together with me

01:00:18.627 --> 01:00:19.794
Yeah, praying...

01:00:20.628 --> 01:00:21.628
asshole

01:00:22.326 --> 01:00:23.127
Ok...

01:00:23.894 --> 01:00:24.991
I'm getting back inside

01:00:24.993 --> 01:00:27.228
Oh come on, Mandy, do
not make a scene, you too

01:00:56.793 --> 01:00:59.595
Please don't tell me you're
considering the idea of going by foot

01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:01.292
It will be a half-day
walk, at least

01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:02.661
No cellphones working, yet?

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:03.828
No

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.295
I'll call the janitor

01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:07.628
he gave me his number

01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:11.893
and may Vanja's God end it well

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.561
meaning he comes

01:01:14.426 --> 01:01:15.827
and pick us up, immediately

01:01:16.393 --> 01:01:17.093
I'll make the call

01:01:18.194 --> 01:01:18.894
Oh come on, Gioia,
let Bart call

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.361
He would trust the voice
of a girl more than a boy

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.795
it's far better

01:01:23.694 --> 01:01:24.358
If that's your wish

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.294
let's hope he answer, though

01:01:25.892 --> 01:01:26.695
Number, please

01:01:27.293 --> 01:01:28.294
0 6

01:01:29.393 --> 01:01:30.561
9 8

01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:32.694
9 3

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.061
No service

01:01:43.294 --> 01:01:44.160
What are you talking about?
Give it to me

01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:56.828
Ok, we need to stay calm

01:01:58.259 --> 01:01:59.993
Is there anything going
on track today or what?

01:02:00.859 --> 01:02:01.794
I said we need to stay calm

01:02:02.693 --> 01:02:03.194
Yeah, indeed, guys

01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:04.562
we just need to relax

01:02:05.761 --> 01:02:06.526
tomorrow the van will be back
we can get a ride to the city

01:02:06.528 --> 01:02:08.361
Yes, but,
what do we do now?

01:02:09.661 --> 01:02:10.493
we make a video-review
of this shitty place

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.093
and ruin the reputation
of the oldies, uh?

01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:16.794
do you wanna go first?

01:02:17.694 --> 01:02:18.662
No, John drop that

01:02:19.227 --> 01:02:20.228
ok, ok

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:23.728
let's wait for Vanja to
be done with his prayers

01:02:24.327 --> 01:02:25.061
in the end

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.562
it's all about us

01:02:28.026 --> 01:02:29.027
together

01:02:29.826 --> 01:02:30.725
including him

01:02:30.727 --> 01:02:32.192
Gioia please don't
start with this...

01:02:32.194 --> 01:02:33.227
Yeah, let's move forward

01:02:33.826 --> 01:02:34.692
and first of all

01:02:34.694 --> 01:02:35.860
let's take Eve back to us

01:03:35.727 --> 01:03:36.728
Eve?

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:39.194
hey, it's us

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:41.127
only girls

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.627
would you let us
in for a moment?

01:03:47.427 --> 01:03:48.228
Eve

01:03:48.827 --> 01:03:49.726
we have to talk

01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:53.160
if you won't let us
in, please come out

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:55.928
we need to know
what to do next

01:03:58.759 --> 01:04:00.260
Eve, come on, please

01:04:01.259 --> 01:04:02.726
- we just wanna leave
- But...

01:04:04.093 --> 01:04:06.193
we need to stick together
in order to do that

01:04:08.294 --> 01:04:09.294
how about...

01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:11.726
...coming down to
talk about that

01:04:12.326 --> 01:04:12.927
down in the hall

01:04:54.926 --> 01:04:56.561
<i>Please, Eve, come on</i>

01:04:57.259 --> 01:04:58.160
<i>I beg you, I'm sorry</i>

01:04:59.326 --> 01:05:00.760
<i>but please come
out here now</i>

01:05:06.259 --> 01:05:07.960
<i>Eve! what's going on?</i>

01:05:19.094 --> 01:05:19.993
Eve

01:05:20.693 --> 01:05:21.694
where are you?

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.861
Shit...

01:05:26.194 --> 01:05:27.328
She's not there

01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:31.561
but...

01:05:32.727 --> 01:05:33.827
she didn't even jumped off
the window, don't worry John

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.028
Let's go look for her

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.760
Ok, but...

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:42.562
...we need someone
that stays here,

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.160
just in case she comes back

01:05:46.194 --> 01:05:47.194
I'll stay here

01:05:47.927 --> 01:05:49.161
you go and find her

01:05:49.893 --> 01:05:50.595
Are you sure, Mandy?

01:05:51.626 --> 01:05:52.861
Eve could be angry with you

01:05:53.693 --> 01:05:54.694
I know but

01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:56.927
I have to apologise to her

01:05:57.792 --> 01:05:58.826
even if it wasn't my fault

01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:02.727
maybe if we find ourselves alone
it would be easier to talk

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.561
Good call, Mandy

01:06:06.693 --> 01:06:08.027
Ok, let's go then

01:06:13.226 --> 01:06:14.227
Guys

01:06:16.726 --> 01:06:17.727
nothing, just

01:06:19.859 --> 01:06:22.060
please come back soon,
if you can't find her

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.562
Mandy,

01:06:24.892 --> 01:06:26.626
lock yourself into
the room if it feels safer

01:06:27.327 --> 01:06:28.061
we'll be back in a minute

01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:29.227
Ok

01:06:29.959 --> 01:06:30.794
I'll see you in a minute

01:06:31.393 --> 01:06:32.028
In a minute

01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:41.593
Hi everybody

01:06:42.194 --> 01:06:43.627
today's vlog is

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.161
dedicated to all of you

01:06:47.294 --> 01:06:48.295
who can stop thinking
about the holidays

01:06:49.393 --> 01:06:50.360
so

01:06:51.426 --> 01:06:54.027
what do you think the
best training suit for...

01:07:13.693 --> 01:07:14.594
Guys

01:08:07.094 --> 01:08:08.992
If she's not outside
where did she possibly go?

01:08:08.994 --> 01:08:09.959
I don't really understand

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.827
maybe she's back in her
room talking to Mandy

01:08:12.393 --> 01:08:13.328
Let's go back upstairs

01:08:20.727 --> 01:08:21.727
wait a minute, guys

01:08:22.892 --> 01:08:24.295
maybe I should go by myself

01:08:27.225 --> 01:08:28.125
Ok,

01:08:28.127 --> 01:08:29.560
- are you sure John?
- Yeah

01:08:32.225 --> 01:08:33.260
would you mind to wait?

01:08:35.393 --> 01:08:36.560
Ok, Bart

01:08:37.658 --> 01:08:38.689
I'll go get my stuff
in my bedroom

01:08:38.692 --> 01:08:39.660
would you take me there?

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:41.791
I'll stay here just
in case she comes back

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:43.124
she would take the
stairs sooner or later

01:08:43.126 --> 01:08:44.225
Okay, if I don't find her

01:08:44.227 --> 01:08:45.790
I'll be back here
with Mandy, ok?

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:46.893
Ok, perfect

01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:53.260
Mandy?

01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:54.892
Eve?

01:08:55.926 --> 01:08:57.260
could you please open the door?

01:08:58.993 --> 01:08:59.827
come on

01:09:01.126 --> 01:09:03.993
first of all let's leave
this fucking place

01:09:05.394 --> 01:09:07.228
we will talk about everything

01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:09.359
once we'll be back in town

01:10:13.193 --> 01:10:14.194
What the fuck...

01:10:15.693 --> 01:10:16.694
oh shit!

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360
shit!

01:10:35.227 --> 01:10:36.360
Jesus Christ...

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:54.359
shit

01:13:58.326 --> 01:13:59.327
Help me

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.160
please

01:14:05.027 --> 01:14:06.028
Vanja, help me, please

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.661
I can't understand

01:14:11.158 --> 01:14:12.160
Don't you worry

01:14:13.259 --> 01:14:14.260
where is Gioia?

01:14:16.393 --> 01:14:17.560
What?

01:14:19.258 --> 01:14:20.260
Where is Gioia?

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.727
<i>Gioia is here, with me</i>

01:14:27.325 --> 01:14:28.159
Who are you?

01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:36.727
<i>I'm the one</i>

01:14:37.426 --> 01:14:39.560
<i>who resides inside here</i>

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:40.793
Tell me your name

01:14:44.692 --> 01:14:45.826
<i>Xariar Imne</i>

01:14:46.927 --> 01:14:47.924
I can't understand
that language

01:14:47.926 --> 01:14:49.027
that's useless

01:14:49.759 --> 01:14:51.260
<i>Lilith, Hekmet,</i>

01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:53.126
<i>Abrahel, Molock</i>

01:14:53.727 --> 01:14:54.727
Oh Lord,

01:14:55.627 --> 01:14:56.594
you great, you God

01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:58.660
set us free, oh Lord

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.561
set us free from any kind

01:15:01.259 --> 01:15:03.259
of evil spell, charme, sourcery

01:15:03.994 --> 01:15:05.226
from any occult evil

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.661
oh Lord, set us free

01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:11.660
from any evil spell

01:15:12.093 --> 01:15:13.193
from any istinct

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.093
of death and distruction

01:15:15.826 --> 01:15:16.960
we shall ask in prayer

01:15:18.126 --> 01:15:20.059
<i>You fear me,
you dirty...</i>

01:15:20.692 --> 01:15:21.127
No

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.794
it's you that fear me

01:15:23.693 --> 01:15:24.359
you fear my faith

01:15:25.093 --> 01:15:25.693
in the name of which

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.360
I order you to leave
this body in peace

01:15:29.226 --> 01:15:30.960
<i>I am killing you</i>

01:15:33.192 --> 01:15:34.192
No

01:15:35.226 --> 01:15:36.594
in the name of God

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.693
I send you back, Joanna

01:15:39.426 --> 01:15:41.092
I send you back to Hell

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.160
to the flames you came from

01:16:42.693 --> 01:16:43.661
<i>To you</i>

01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:46.561
<i>who swear at the one
that guarded on yourselves</i>

01:16:47.627 --> 01:16:48.627
<i>To you</i>

01:16:49.926 --> 01:16:51.293
<i>who's holding
pitchforks and sticks</i>

01:16:52.393 --> 01:16:53.560
<i>To you</i>

01:16:54.259 --> 01:16:55.127
<i>who settled this country</i>

01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:57.257
<i>To you</i>

01:16:57.259 --> 01:16:58.661
<i>who does not own a single</i>

01:16:59.692 --> 01:17:00.926
<i>crumb of this Kingdom</i>

01:17:02.693 --> 01:17:03.827
<i>I shall dedicate</i>

01:17:04.993 --> 01:17:06.594
<i>to you all these
words and whispers</i>

01:17:07.826 --> 01:17:10.126
<i>I shall send to you
my tireless spirit</i>

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:11.661
so that

01:17:12.793 --> 01:17:15.092
<i>it could harass
your sleep</i>

01:17:15.992 --> 01:17:16.993
<i>and by tying</i>

01:17:18.126 --> 01:17:19.027
<i>this rope
around my neck</i>

01:17:20.425 --> 01:17:22.226
<i>I shall extract my soul</i>

01:17:23.258 --> 01:17:24.594
<i>and this
unbearable burden</i>

01:17:25.793 --> 01:17:27.593
<i>that you're now
putting on me</i>

01:17:28.292 --> 01:17:29.593
<i>I shall put it on you</i>

01:17:30.425 --> 01:17:31.660
<i>To you</i>

01:17:32.359 --> 01:17:33.560
<i>and your posterity</i>

01:17:35.325 --> 01:17:36.327
<i>for ever</i>
