00:26.193 --> 00:27.610
- Tag. You're it.
- You're it.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.987
- No, I tagged you last.
- Uh-uh.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.366
- Wanna go fishing?
- No fish. They're frozen.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.577
- No, they don't freeze.
- What do they do? Just die?

00:36.745 --> 00:40.790
- No. Hey, look at this car.
- Wow. A beauty.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.751
- Isn't that neat? It's a Ford.
- It's not a Ford.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.545
Yeah, it is. Then what is it?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.464
I don't know, but it's not a Ford.
I've been in one.

01:06.150 --> 01:10.820
Hey, Leonard, what are you doing?
What's it look like?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.989
Somebody might be coming.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.408
Keep a lookout, James.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.953
- No one's here.
- No one's coming.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.581
- My turn's next.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.713
What's wrong, Leonard?

01:58.202 --> 02:00.161
Leonard, honey.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.413
- What?
- Better get dressed.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.416
Your breakfast is just about ready.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.588
- Come on. We'll be late.
- Hi, Albert. James.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.548
Hurry up.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.259
- Hi, Mr. Dylan.
- Morning.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.678
They won't let me play with them.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.890
- You always study.
- Of course he does.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.230
- I'm a natural at this stuff.
- Let's see you pass the test.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.069
We're going to begin today
with a history test.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.656
Keep your eyes on your own papers
and at the recess bell

02:36.824 --> 02:40.034
bring your composition books
up to my desk.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.841
So, what are we gonna do today?
I don't know.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.804
Oh, hello, boys.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.390
Hi, Mrs. Lowe.
Can Leonard come and play today?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.351
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Better not today.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.061
Well, how about tomorrow?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.689
I'm afraid he won't be well
by then either.

03:51.857 --> 03:55.568
- When will he be well?
- I don't know.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.492
Thanks for coming by.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.152
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.113
One moment, please.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.448
Excuse me...
You gotta ask her.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.243
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

05:27.411 --> 05:30.121
Oh, Dr. Horowitz,
can you hold the line?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.164
Bainbridge Hospital,
can I help you?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.292
Yes. Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in a board meeting.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.920
Can I take a message,
or would you like...? Bye.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.630
Yes?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.842
Yes, I'm Dr. Malcolm Sayer.
I have an appointment.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.594
Take a seat, please.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.639
Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

05:48.807 --> 05:52.601
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

05:52.769 --> 05:56.355
I can connect you to the cafeteria
but they will have to page him.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.525
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.319
Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in the boardroom.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.781
I can take messages, or you can
call back in about 45 minutes.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.037
When you say "people,"
you mean living people?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.788
Mm-hm.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.751
Well, I'm here to apply
for a research position

06:16.918 --> 06:18.711
in your neurology lab.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.880
Neurology lab?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.465
We have an x-ray room.

06:22.632 --> 06:27.595
This is a chronic hospital, doctor.
The position is for staff neurologist.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.431
You will be working with
patients, people. Yes.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.559
A "doctor" doctor.
Doctor.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.313
Carmel Institute? Tell me about that.
Anything with patients there?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.398
Earthworms.
I'm sorry?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.609
It was an immense project.

06:41.777 --> 06:45.988
I was to extract one decagram
of myelin from 4 tons of earthworms.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.656
Really?
Yes.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.743
I was on that project
for five years.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.830
I was the only one who believed in it.
Everyone said it couldn't be done.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.709
It can't.
I know that now. I proved it.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.171
Maybe before, at St. Thomas?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.716
All research?
Oh, yes.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.011
This isn't going to work.
Ben, we're totally understaffed.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.263
He's never worked
with human beings.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.724
His research talents
would be wasted here.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.811
If it wasn't a state law...
Excuse me. But, uh...

07:17.562 --> 07:21.857
You're clearly looking for someone
with more of a clinical background.

07:22.025 --> 07:26.904
As much as I need a job, there must be more
applicants suitable for this position.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.908
Thank you, anyway.
Dr. Sayer, back in medical school.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.620
You couldn't have graduated
without some clinical experience.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.749
You took a pulse, you took
a temperature. You did diagnosis.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.211
Oh.
Well, there you have it then.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.214
You do want the job, don't you?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.263
Hey, it's this way, doc.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.141
You spend much time
at chronic hospitals?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.892
I, um...

07:57.060 --> 08:00.146
You'd remember.
Guess not then.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.441
- Hi.
- Hey, Christina.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.194
You see, doc, we got MS,
Tourette syndrome,

08:07.362 --> 08:08.904
Parkinson's disease.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.074
Some of them,
we ain't even got a name for.

08:13.869 --> 08:14.952
How are you?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.871
What are all these people
waiting for?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.080
Nothing.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.916
How do they get well?
They don't, they're chronic.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.085
We call this place the Garden.
Why?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.921
Because all we do
is feed and water them.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.298
Thanks, man.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.927
Mr. Kean, I would like to ask...

08:32.095 --> 08:35.097
I was born in 1911
in Kingsbridge, New York.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.433
I came here in July 1955.

08:37.601 --> 08:42.270
Prior to July 1955, I resided
at the Brooklyn Psychiatric Center,

08:42.438 --> 08:45.649
Brooklyn, New York.
Prior to that, I was a person.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.696
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.814
Gets easier.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.068
You don't think it will, but it does.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.857
Oh, no, Buttercup. Oh, good.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.735
No, go to your house. Go. Go.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.946
Go home.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.739
Good.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.417
Good morning, doctor.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.670
I have a new arrival for you.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.424
She was brought in late last night.
Here's her file.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.647
Hello. I'm Dr. Sayer.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.944
Do you know where you are?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.575
Can you hear me?

12:21.825 --> 12:23.742
"Diagnosis."

12:36.047 --> 12:37.840
"Medical insurance." Hm.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.010
Oh, God.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.138
Her name is Lucy Fishman.

14:08.306 --> 14:12.351
She was found by neighbors with her sister
several days after her sister died.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.436
She has no other
living relatives

14:14.604 --> 14:17.397
and they say she has
always been as she is now,

14:17.565 --> 14:20.234
with no response
or comprehension.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.610
And yet...

14:24.447 --> 14:26.281
A reflex.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.910
If she batted it away,
I might call it a reflex.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.870
But she didn't. She caught it.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.830
It's still a reflex, doctor.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.166
I'm sorry. If you were right,
I would agree with you.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.294
It's as if, having lost
all will of her own to act,

14:39.629 --> 14:41.713
she borrows the will of the ball.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.799
The will of the ball?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.551
Excuse me.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.929
This is ridiculous.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.975
Trying to make
a good impression, right?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.143
A good impression.
That's it, isn't it?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.354
You're still settling in.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.733
Miss Costello, will you see to it that Dr.
Sayer's patients that are waiting outside

15:01.901 --> 15:04.528
are rescheduled for tomorrow.
Yes, sir.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.781
Borrows the will of the ball.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.951
That's great.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.414
Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
Okay.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.292
Let us know
if she catches anything else.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.526
I'll be fired.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.945
It's all right. I'll go back to school.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.741
Did I forget something?
No.

15:51.576 --> 15:55.120
I just wanted to say to you
I preferred your explanation

15:55.538 --> 16:00.709
and that I'll look after things
for you until you've settled in.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.712
Good night, doctor.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.881
Thank you.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.134
Thank you very much.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.659
Hello.
Hi.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
I'm Dr. Sayer.
I'm Waheedah.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.580
Waheedah. How are you today?
I'm fine, thank you.

16:44.087 --> 16:48.674
Yes. Oh, sorry. What form?

16:49.217 --> 16:51.218
Yes, I'll hold.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.886
Mm-hm.

16:57.016 --> 17:02.562
Oh. Okay. Three, two.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.315
Oh, thank you.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.942
Bye.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.452
Hello.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.389
- Contact.
- Roger.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.475
Yippee! We made it, Orville.
We're in orbit.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.854
Oh, goody.
Now we can try being weightless.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.526
Let's celebrate
with delicious NestlÃ©'s Quik.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.404
Nothing makes chocolatey milk
like Quik, you know?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.323
That great NestlÃ©'s chocolate flavor
is out of this world.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.617
Out of this world.

17:57.785 --> 18:02.372
Hello, up there. Time to recharge
with delicious NestlÃ©'s Quik.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.865
Lucy. Um...

18:37.617 --> 18:39.659
You're out of the hole.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.547
Um, could...?
Anthony.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.924
Anthony.

18:54.091 --> 18:58.094
Could you help me move this?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.783
Excuse me.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.260
Lucy, you're almost there.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.886
Come on.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.222
Lucy.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.615
Here's the water, Lucy.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.701
Here it is, Lucy.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.454
The water is...

20:12.962 --> 20:15.964
I don't know why your nails
grow so fast.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.636
It must be all that Jell-O
they give you.

20:21.888 --> 20:26.308
Jell-O, Jell-O. Day after day.

20:26.726 --> 20:31.062
Red Jell-O, yellow Jell-O.
Every day, Jell-O.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.733
Hurry up. You don't wanna miss
the laundry truck.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.155
I forgot to tell you,
Mrs. Cooper passed away.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.158
Remember her?
She was nice.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.368
Always a kind word.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.662
Her dog I could have
done without.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.497
Excuse me.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.666
Hello.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.795
Does he ever speak to you?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.673
Of course not. Not in words.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.885
He speaks to you in other ways?

21:02.470 --> 21:04.137
How do you mean?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.806
You don't have children.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.433
No.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.020
If you did, you would know.

21:19.362 --> 21:22.238
This is "atypical schizophrenia."

21:23.282 --> 21:26.326
"Atypical hysteria," this one.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.206
"Atypical nerve impairment."

21:31.499 --> 21:34.751
"No change since
last examination."

21:35.044 --> 21:37.587
"No change or therapy
recommended."

21:37.755 --> 21:39.756
That's very nice.

21:40.466 --> 21:44.719
This one is "no change,"
dated 9-11-44.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.471
Sorry.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.642
That's 25 years.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.853
You'd think, at a certain point,
all these atypical somethings

21:54.021 --> 21:55.730
would amount
to a typical something.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.817
Uh-huh.
But a typical what?

21:59.568 --> 22:00.568
Doctor?
Yes?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.989
Wanna go for a cup of coffee
somewhere or something?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.241
Tea?

22:07.493 --> 22:10.912
Oh, normally, I would say yes.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.247
I made other plans.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.457
Right, right, right.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.085
Well, some other time. All right.
Oh, yes.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.963
I'm over here. Good night.
I'm right there. Night.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.099
"Encephalitis lethargica."

23:13.726 --> 23:15.685
Where is it? Where is it?

23:16.437 --> 23:18.730
"Encephalitis lethargica."

23:22.359 --> 23:25.028
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.
I thought someone left the lights on.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.238
I found it. I found the connection.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.074
They all survived encephalitis.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.243
Years before they came here.
See? In the 1920s.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.662
That's very nice. Yes.
Isn't it wonderful?

23:34.830 --> 23:37.165
I'll come back later.
Please.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.024
How many have you found there?

24:04.401 --> 24:07.403
Five, and I believe
there are more.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.199
How are they?

24:13.035 --> 24:17.205
Just as you described them back
then, "insubstantial as ghosts."

24:18.874 --> 24:23.253
Only I guess many of them
were children then.

24:24.630 --> 24:29.050
Yes. Children who fell asleep.

24:32.221 --> 24:36.599
Most died during the acute stage
of the illness.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.562
Those who survived, who awoke,

24:41.063 --> 24:44.065
seemed fine,
as though nothing had happened.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.484
We just didn't realize

24:46.652 --> 24:49.654
how much the infection
had damaged the brain.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.910
Years went by, five, 10, 15,

24:56.912 --> 25:02.000
before these strange
neurological symptoms would appear.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.085
But they did.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.257
I began to see them
in the early 1930s.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.345
Old people brought in
by their children.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.932
Young people brought in
by their parents.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.644
They could no longer
dress themselves

25:22.271 --> 25:24.022
or feed themselves.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.442
They could no longer speak
in most cases.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.444
Some families went mad.

25:31.113 --> 25:34.949
People who were normal
were now...

25:36.952 --> 25:38.661
elsewhere.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.956
What's it like to be them?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.292
What are they thinking?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.629
They're not.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.218
The virus didn't spare
their higher faculties.

25:53.761 --> 25:57.055
We know that for a fact?
Yes.

25:57.806 --> 25:58.890
Because?

25:59.058 --> 26:02.685
Because the alternative
is unthinkable.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.567
- He has a crush on you.
- Oh, stop.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.069
- He does.
- No, he doesn't.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.905
- He asked for your number.
- Come on.

26:56.073 --> 26:57.448
He did.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.746
Ow!

27:07.876 --> 27:11.254
I'm all for fixing this place up,
but what are we doing?

27:11.422 --> 27:13.047
I have a hunch.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.925
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.761
What's stopping Lucy
from crossing to the fountain?

27:18.929 --> 27:20.263
Nothing.
Exactly.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.265
The visual field just stops.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.768
There's a void. There's no pattern.
No visual rhythm.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.354
Nothing to compel her
to keep going.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.065
So we're making something.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.275
Exactly.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.820
All right, Lucy.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.589
She's... Yes.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.326
She's looking out the...

28:30.751 --> 28:33.336
Where's that article? Where is it?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.964
This the right issue?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.469
This is last year's. I can't find it.

28:43.472 --> 28:47.392
I'd like to know more about your son.
Certainly.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.650
Something was wrong, they said,
with his hands.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.860
He couldn't write anymore.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.196
He couldn't do the work.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.825
I should take him out of school,
they said.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.326
He was 11.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.871
Slowly, he got worse.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.499
He'd call me and I'd come in.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.836
And he'd be sitting at his desk
in a trance.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.088
One hour, two hours.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.674
Then he'd be okay again.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.096
One day I came home from work,
found him in his bed.

29:25.514 --> 29:29.267
He kept saying, "Mom. Mom."

29:31.103 --> 29:33.104
His arm like this, reaching.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.399
"What do you want, Leonard?"

29:36.567 --> 29:38.192
He never spoke again.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.861
It was like he disappeared.

29:41.238 --> 29:45.616
Later that year,
I took him to Bainbridge.

29:47.327 --> 29:53.416
It was November 14th, 1939.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.043
He was 20 years old.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.755
What did he do for those nine years
he was in this room, Mrs. Lowe?

29:59.923 --> 30:01.716
He read.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.551
He loved to read.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.052
He read all the time.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.846
Really?

30:08.640 --> 30:11.142
Well, that's all he could do.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.623
That's enough.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.170
Leonard.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.507
All right, Leonard, we're finished.

30:47.387 --> 30:51.933
Nothing, nothing, nothing
and nothing.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.436
Don't tell me. It's one of your statues.
Exactly.

30:55.604 --> 30:56.771
How did I guess that?

30:56.939 --> 30:58.731
Pass the salt, will you?

31:00.734 --> 31:03.361
But what about this?

31:04.279 --> 31:07.031
Heh, heh. What do you mean "this"?
It's a strobe.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.325
You're wrong.

31:09.493 --> 31:13.329
All of this before is the strobe.
This is me saying his name to him.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.293
Excuse me.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.464
What does that mean?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.977
Hey!
Sorry.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.980
Right down the middle.
Hum it in there. Hum it in there.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.731
Home run. Home run.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.817
I can catch a ball.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.485
Hey, doc, throw me the ball.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.363
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.533
Get back.
Hey, I can catch a ball.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.620
- Doc. Hey.
- I said, get back.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.791
- Is this all of them?
- Yes.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.085
Bring them in here with the others.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.356
I should have given David
his divorce.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.735
I just thought he really would want
to be a father to his son.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.820
Excuse me.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.781
The patients have been given
their morning medication.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.742
That's good.

32:33.619 --> 32:37.997
Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time.
Wanna come with me, please.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.043
Beth?
Yeah.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.964
One of the most beautiful arias
ever written.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.925
Watch them closely
for any reactions.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.741
"Call me Ishmael.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.917
Years ago,
never mind how long precisely,

33:23.085 --> 33:24.960
having little or no money

33:25.128 --> 33:28.005
and nothing particular
to interest me on shore..."

33:29.716 --> 33:32.093
Leonard, I know you can hear me.

33:32.260 --> 33:36.097
I want you to try and respond
when I speak your name.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.226
See, it's not just any music.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.562
It has to be the music
that's right for them.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.824
It's like they're only moved
by music that moves them.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.535
I haven't found anything
that moves Bert yet.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.967
They'll sit like that all day
if I let them.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.761
I have to play the first card.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.687
L.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.108
Leonard.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.025
L.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.305
This is Frank.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.183
If you could just me help me
get him to his feet.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.685
There's something else
that reaches him.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.146
What?
Human contact.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.940
If you could just stand over there
for a minute.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.944
He can't walk without me.
If I let go of him, he'll fall.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.239
I'm not gonna let you fall.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.325
But...

35:20.202 --> 35:22.411
he'll walk with me anywhere.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.459
It's like the ball,
only it's my will he's borrowing.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.378
The will of another human being.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.221
Just let it glide.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.223
Gentle. Gentle.

35:55.612 --> 36:02.159
I'll begin by moving the pointer to L,
for Leonard.

36:03.078 --> 36:07.289
When you begin to move the pointer,
I'll stop and you take over.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.291
Do you understand?

36:10.043 --> 36:12.253
All right. I'm beginning.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.174
Very good.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.560
No, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.562
My fault. I, uh...

36:34.359 --> 36:35.734
I.

36:40.949 --> 36:44.118
L. Oh, good, good.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.078
Now the E.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.248
K.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.375
Dyslexia.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.962
E. Good, good.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.965
S.

37:00.927 --> 37:01.969
P.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.515
You're spelling something else.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.336
Rilke.

37:56.358 --> 37:59.693
His gaze
From staring through the bars

37:59.861 --> 38:04.907
Has grown so weary
That it can take in nothing more

38:05.075 --> 38:09.078
For him, it is as though
There were a thousand bars

38:09.245 --> 38:13.874
And behind the thousand bars
No world

38:14.876 --> 38:19.254
As he paces in cramped circles
Over and over

38:19.714 --> 38:22.299
His powerful strides
Are like a ritual dance

38:22.467 --> 38:27.554
Around a center
Where a great will stands paralyzed

38:29.057 --> 38:33.227
At times, the curtains of the eye
Lift without a sound

38:33.395 --> 38:34.853
And a shape enters

38:35.021 --> 38:38.190
Slips through the tightened silence
Of the shoulders

38:38.358 --> 38:41.777
Reaches the heart, and dies

38:49.494 --> 38:51.245
Have you heard of
the drug L-dopa?

38:51.413 --> 38:54.581
What?
It's a synthetic dopamine.

38:54.749 --> 38:59.712
Oh, yes, I did.
For Parkinson's patients, yeah. Why?

38:59.879 --> 39:00.921
Nothing.

39:01.089 --> 39:04.299
Sign the petition now.
Thousands of young men

39:04.467 --> 39:06.093
are dying every day.
Sorry.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.596
Help us get out of this illegal war.
Sign up now.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.515
A hundred years would pass

39:11.683 --> 39:14.518
before modern neuropathology
would even allow us

39:14.686 --> 39:19.148
to actually locate the damage
in the Parkinsonian brain.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.025
Yes.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.820
With our development
of the drug L-dopa,

39:25.321 --> 39:27.031
we can, for the first time,

39:27.198 --> 39:31.035
promise the Parkinsonian patient
a more normal life.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.121
By administering L...

39:35.832 --> 39:38.042
Thank you. Yes, um...

39:38.418 --> 39:40.294
I'm very curious about this drug,

39:40.462 --> 39:43.964
and I wonder if you've come across
anyone who might have...

39:44.132 --> 39:46.508
Excuse me, doctor?

39:47.719 --> 39:52.347
Sayer. I'm curious if you've come
across any patients with encephalitis?

39:52.515 --> 39:56.226
After I'm through, Dr. Sayer.
If you wouldn't mind.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.816
- Excuse me.
- As I was saying,

40:02.984 --> 40:05.986
by administering L-dopa...

40:10.492 --> 40:13.494
Do you think a Parkinsonian tremor
taken to its extreme,

40:13.661 --> 40:15.996
would appear as no tremor at all?

40:20.335 --> 40:22.669
You talking to me?
Oh, yes.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.967
Imagine you accelerated
a Parkinsonian hand tremor

40:29.135 --> 40:31.887
to the point of immobility in the...

40:32.806 --> 40:34.264
Suppose there's a patient

40:34.432 --> 40:36.850
with Parkinsonian compulsions
accelerated:

40:37.018 --> 40:40.687
The hand tremor, the head bobbing,
ticking, quickening of speech.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.148
Might they not all cave in
on themselves

40:43.316 --> 40:45.901
and, in effect,
turn a person into stone?

40:47.278 --> 40:50.197
I don't know. Maybe.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.077
Well, do you think L-dopa
would help the situation?

40:55.245 --> 40:59.039
Dr. Sayers, right?
Heh, heh.

40:59.541 --> 41:03.001
I'm just a chemist, doctor.
You're the physician.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.838
I'll leave it to you to do the damage.

41:12.971 --> 41:16.974
You know, Freud believed in miracles,
prescribing cocaine like candy.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.809
We all believed in cortisone,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.228
till our patients
went psychotic on it.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.563
And now it's L-dopa?

41:22.730 --> 41:25.607
With all due respect, it's
rather too soon to say that.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.317
Well, with all due respect,

41:27.485 --> 41:30.696
I think it's rather way
too soon to say that.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.991
Let the chemists do the damage,
doctor.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.618
But I...

41:48.256 --> 41:49.756
Dr. Kaufman?
Yeah.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.925
Did you read this case?

41:52.093 --> 41:54.720
"New drug lets shaking
palsy patients eat Jell-O."

41:54.888 --> 41:58.182
Yes, I read them, doctor.
I read them all. Dutifully, soberly.

41:58.349 --> 42:02.519
All 30 cases had Parkinson's.
Mild Parkinson's.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.855
Your Parkies,
if that's what they are,

42:05.023 --> 42:06.607
haven't moved in decades.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.026
Look at it again, sir.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.781
Now, you know better
than to make a leap like that.

42:15.450 --> 42:19.036
You want there to be a connection.
That doesn't mean there is one.

42:19.537 --> 42:24.166
What I believe, what I know,
is these people are alive inside.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.005
How do you know that, doctor?
Because they catch tennis balls?

42:33.092 --> 42:34.635
I know it.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.305
How many did you think
I'd let you put on it?

42:38.473 --> 42:39.640
All of them.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.811
Some. One.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.693
One. With the family's consent,
signed.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.746
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?

43:04.332 --> 43:05.707
No. Um...

43:07.168 --> 43:10.921
Well, his symptoms
are like Parkinson's,

43:11.506 --> 43:13.423
but then again, they're not.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.844
Then what will this medicine do
for him?

43:19.514 --> 43:22.849
I don't know what it will do for him,
if anything at all.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.727
What do you think it'll do?

43:27.146 --> 43:31.108
I'm not sure, because it was designed
for a totally different disorder.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.236
What do you hope it'll do?

43:35.738 --> 43:39.116
I hope it'll bring him back
from wherever he is.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.329
To what?

43:45.039 --> 43:46.790
To the world.

43:50.420 --> 43:53.922
What's there here for him
after all these years?

43:56.551 --> 43:57.884
You.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.262
You're here.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.969
All of it, please.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.615
At 200 milligrams,
he showed no response.

45:01.783 --> 45:03.867
Maybe the acid
in the juice neutralized it.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.286
Maybe he needs more.
Maybe he needs less.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.042
I'll try it in milk.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.871
Five hundred milligrams.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.420
Mets 2, Giants 2. Bottom half...

45:56.587 --> 45:59.214
I'll call if there's any change.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.341
Yes.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.638
Here's the pitch, on the way.

46:06.806 --> 46:08.890
It's swung on. A high fly ball.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.725
Thank you.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.903
Night, Sara.
Good night.

49:01.522 --> 49:05.525
It's quiet.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.863
It's late.

49:10.406 --> 49:12.866
Everyone's asleep.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.749
I'm not asleep.

49:21.751 --> 49:25.503
No. You're awake.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.849
May I?

49:55.576 --> 49:57.410
Me.

51:04.478 --> 51:05.520
Leonard.

51:09.775 --> 51:12.152
There's someone here to see you.

51:28.669 --> 51:31.546
Ma. Ma.

51:33.466 --> 51:34.841
Mom.

51:36.302 --> 51:38.344
Oh, my baby.

51:57.198 --> 51:58.364
My name is Eleanor.

52:00.201 --> 52:01.618
Eleanor.

52:04.538 --> 52:09.626
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

52:14.548 --> 52:18.593
Ladies? Please.
Oh, now what did I do?

52:21.347 --> 52:23.389
Oh, my goodness.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.269
How do you do, sir?

52:28.729 --> 52:30.480
My name is Margaret.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.566
Margaret.

52:34.235 --> 52:36.486
Beth.
Beth.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.493
Anthony.

52:46.914 --> 52:49.749
Anthony, how are you?

52:51.377 --> 52:54.087
Great, man. How are you?

52:55.214 --> 52:57.966
Great too.
Ha, ha, ha.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.468
All right, man.

53:01.470 --> 53:03.388
You meet him?
Didn't he look good?

53:03.556 --> 53:04.931
Yeah.

53:07.601 --> 53:10.937
- Don't eat so fast.
- He's doing fine.

53:11.105 --> 53:13.690
I mean, he's starving, right?
He was starving.

53:13.983 --> 53:17.068
I don't think I could deal with losing
30 years of my life. Could you?

53:17.236 --> 53:19.279
I can't even imagine it.

53:21.574 --> 53:23.700
- Potatoes?
- Hey.

53:23.868 --> 53:27.412
Come on, try something else.
He does realize it, doesn't he?

53:33.627 --> 53:35.712
Now, Leonard,
turn this way, please.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.131
It's a camera called
a Polaroid.

53:38.299 --> 53:39.924
Thank you.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.970
Takes a picture
in less than a minute.

53:44.138 --> 53:45.388
Amazing.

53:45.556 --> 53:49.434
Now, if you could try this.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.982
Splendid, that's wonderful.

53:56.150 --> 53:59.444
I'd like you to walk now
to the end of the room.

53:59.612 --> 54:02.196
Good. Ready?

54:02.364 --> 54:03.656
Go.

54:05.326 --> 54:09.203
Very good.

54:12.499 --> 54:14.500
And back now.

54:17.212 --> 54:20.590
Dr. Sheck to X-ray.
Dr. Sheck to the X-ray.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.677
That was very quick, really.
Let me get some more film.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.736
You have to at least lay down.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.780
You need the rest.

55:33.080 --> 55:36.874
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.919
If I close my eyes, I'll...
You'll sleep.

55:40.295 --> 55:45.216
When you wake up in the morning,
it'll be the next morning.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.593
I promise.

57:51.927 --> 57:54.303
Happiest day, man.
Far out.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.222
Yes, I...

57:57.224 --> 57:59.225
Look out.
Poison.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.647
What a wonderful place
the Bronx has become.

58:20.497 --> 58:23.166
That's my school.
Really?

58:31.758 --> 58:35.261
Is that classical?
You pick any type of music you want.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.186
What's that?
It's rock 'n' roll.

58:44.938 --> 58:47.106
Come on.
No.

59:10.881 --> 59:13.758
Come on.
Go get it, boy. Go get it.

59:13.926 --> 59:16.844
Attaboy.
Come on, give it back.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.772
Come on in.
No, no.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.984
Come back in. Something happened
while you've been away.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.278
Pollution. I don't think this is wise.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:19.365
Leonard, that's not wading,
that's swimming. Come on, Leonard.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.452
Leonard, I don't know if the
hospital is covered for this.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.746
Leonard.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.000
Come on.
No, no. Not...

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.085
Come on in.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.510
Leonard, the tide's coming in.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.112
That's the periodic table
of elements.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.240
I can date my introduction
to science by that.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.244
It's wonderful, really. It's...

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:07.955
It's the universe at its essence.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:10.666
You see,
you have your alkaline metals.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.753
You have your halogens,
your inert gases.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.172
Every element has its place
in that order.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.591
You can't change that.

01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:22.261
They're secure, no matter what.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:23.804
You're not married?

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.724
Me?

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.976
No.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:32.438
I'm not very good with people.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.273
I, um...

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.942
I never have been, Leonard.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.778
I like them.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.825
I wish I could say I had more than a
rudimentary understanding of them.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.581
Maybe if they were
less unpredictable.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.710
Eleanor would disagree with you.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.965
Eleanor?
Miss Costello.

01:02:02.094 --> 01:02:04.136
Oh, of course.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.306
She's spoken to you about me?

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.020
What did she say?

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.649
That you are a kind man.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:20.820
That you care very much for people.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:29.286
I'd like to put the rest
of the group on the drug.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.580
I realize this may be
somewhat expensive.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.708
When you say expensive,
you have any idea how much money?

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:38.421
Yes, I talked to Ray.
I have an estimate, um...

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:41.674
Thank you. The pharmacist says

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:47.596
to put the others on the same dosage
as Mr. Lowe would be, um, 12,000.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.724
How much?
$12,000.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.017
A month?
Yes.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.937
I can't go before the board with that,
doctor.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.524
I was thinking of speaking directly
to the patrons.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.902
The few patrons this hospital has
already give what they can.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.281
We'll convince them to give more
than they're accustomed to giving.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:11.454
Perhaps if they see Mr. Lowe.
I think you overestimate the effect

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.207
that Mr. Lowe has on people, doctor.
We're talking about money.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.960
There was an extreme rigidity
of the axial musculature.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.922
A gross impairment
of the postural reflexes.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.092
An autonomic dysfunction.
It is a brain stem type of rigidity.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.594
A meningismus.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:12.723
What's most striking
is the profound facial masking,

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.351
or deafferentation,
which we now know

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.562
should not to be confused
with apathy or catatonia.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.530
Some things could reach him,
though.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:33.536
The mention of his name,
notes of a particular piece of music.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.288
Or the touch
of another human being.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.002
But awakenings were rare
and transient,

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.879
lasting only a moment or two.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:48.092
The rest of the time, he remained, as
you see him here, in a metaphorical,

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:53.180
if not physiological,
equivalent of sleep, or even death.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:57.351
This was his condition when found by
me in a remote bay of this hospital,

01:04:57.519 --> 01:05:01.647
and the quality of his life
for the last 30 years.

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.324
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:17.663
My name is Leonard Lowe.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:23.627
It has been explained to me that
I have been away for quite some time.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.674
I'm back.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:50.863
Okay, here we go.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.450
Take her away.
Okay.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.910
Thank you very much.
Sure.

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.537
Thank you.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:12.259
In the United States,
antiwar protesters organized

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:15.137
a national moratorium
to demonstrate opposition...

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.699
Dr. Sayer.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.577
What is it?
It's a fucking miracle.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.253
Where are my glasses?
On your face.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.463
Oh. Thank you.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.645
I just feel so...

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.276
Beth, close the door.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.446
I'm talking.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.661
Light.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.623
I'm loose.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.083
I'm scared.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.793
Hello?

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:35.843
- Where is this?
- Don't worry.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:40.681
I'm walking.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:43.809
Who are you?

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.644
Get up, get up.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.664
Thank you for coming.
Things are different.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.499
- Miriam.
- Miriam.

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.168
Miriam.
Good morning.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.170
- Look at that.
- Come on, Miriam.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.046
- Miriam. Miriam.
- I'm so excited.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.299
Come on, Miriam.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.595
If you don't eat this food,
I'm gonna be in trouble.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.848
Lucy.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.100
I...

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.354
I had the strangest dream.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.398
I have to take
your blood pressure.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:34.693
I've been sitting for 25 years,
you missed your chance.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.821
Are you okay?

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:40.866
I need some makeup.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:43.952
Okay. I think we can
take care of that.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:48.372
And I need some dye for my hair.
Black.

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:52.085
Black? Rose, are you sure?

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.379
Yes. It's always been black.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.216
Dr. Sayer,
something about fruit trees.

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:59.676
Prune the fruit trees.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.386
I will.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.307
I want a steak, rare. Ah.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.643
Mashed potatoes and gravy.
String beans.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.729
I was aware of things,
but nothing meant anything to me.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.774
There was no connection to me.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.274
There was a war or two.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:22.407
This morning,
I went to the bathroom all by myself.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.787
Do it, do it, do it.
Heh, heh, heh.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.332
I liked them better the other way.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.586
Protesters marched from a meeting...

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:35.837
Where did they go?

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.550
Rolando, can you speak to me?

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.301
It's Miss Costello.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.849
Do you understand me?

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.313
Lucy...

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:55.190
what year is it?

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.193
What year is it?

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.950
It's '26, silly.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.286
Miriam.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:10.372
Miriam. Come on, Miriam, be a sport.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.458
- It will only take a second.
- Don't touch.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.793
- Miriam.
- Don't.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.962
Oh, jeez, I'm getting tired of this.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.047
Come on, Miriam.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.887
I'm convinced. I really am.

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.850
"Like crowds storming the Bastille,

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:33.729
the mighty Mets stormed
their locker room shortly after 9:00

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.064
on their night to remember

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.984
and touched off
one of the loudest, wildest,

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:43.405
wettest victory celebrations
in baseball history.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:48.076
Released from bondage and ridicule
after seven destitute seasons,

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.745
they raised the roof...

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.997
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly...

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.918
- Of Shea Stadium."

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.170
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.839
Sidney.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.176
Hi, Sidney.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.094
Hi.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.360
Are we gonna go
to the same place?

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.362
- I don't know.
- Stay together.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.949
Stop. Pay attention.
Stay together. Bring up the back.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.867
Everybody stay together,
come on.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.703
Bye. Bye.
Here.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.957
Bring Leonard.
Anthony, get Leonard. It's all right.

01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.920
Wait. Leonard. Len.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.048
Len, come on, come on, come on.

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:47.552
- Please, stay with the group.
- Hurry up.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.263
Come on now.
Stay together.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:52.557
Hurry up.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.355
Okay, everybody get in. Back here.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:02.025
- Okay, no pushing, no pushing.
- Just hop.

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.861
Hey, doctor, I wanted to ask you

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.905
how my father is.
The same.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.117
Try and make room.
Ma, maybe you shouldn't go.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.704
Oh, no. Of course I wanna go.
Don't be ridiculous.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.080
I'm gonna take the stairs.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:17.541
It's crowded.
We'll go another time.

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:21.128
You can't be there, Leonard,
or the door won't close. Thank you.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:22.796
Bert, stop jumping!

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.927
Sidney's going.
He's a patient, Mom.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:33.140
He's not the same kind of patient.
But he's still a patient, you're not.

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:35.100
I'm your mother.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.728
Are there any
other mothers going?

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:39.438
Joseph.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.605
Wait a minute.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.941
Now, what have you done
to your hair?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:47.195
Yes, Bert. That's a tire.
I know it's a tire, I'm not an idiot.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.322
There's your bus, Ma. There, go.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.074
Have fun.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:53.368
Don't you worry about it.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.621
They treat me like an asshole.
We'll take care of that.

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:58.790
See you guys.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:00.834
- There.
- All right?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.628
- Bye-bye.
- Come on.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.758
- Rolando. Rolando.
- You go in the back.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.678
Now, move on back, please.
Right here.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:15.098
You ready, Leonard?
I decided not to go. I'm gonna stay.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.350
Why? What's wrong?
I'm okay, just...

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:18.810
Bye, Leonard.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.520
Wave.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:26.359
I'm...

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.111
Doctor, come on already.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:31.573
I'm... All right. Leonard, are you sure?
Are you all right?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.826
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'll see you later.
Have a good time.

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.036
- We...
- Come on.

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:38.246
Have a good time.
I'm coming.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.583
Bert.
Bye, you guys. Have a good time.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.210
Bye-bye
Bert, sit down.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:47.422
- Fish sticks, please.
- Okay.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.509
- Got those french fries.
- Okay, here you go.

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:53.845
Hi. Um...

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:56.389
Meatloaf, please.

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:01.019
Here you go.
Thank you.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.022
Meatloaf.
Meatloaf too.

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:08.401
Thank you.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.612
There you go. Okay?

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:15.033
- Next.
- I'd like fish sticks.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.618
Are you following me?

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.790
Oh, I'm sorry, I was only kidding.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.543
I saw you upstairs just now.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.171
Are you visiting someone?

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:29.798
Uh, no.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.591
You work here.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.719
I live here.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.097
You're a patient?

01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:38.598
That's a dollar 80, baby.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.268
You don't look like a patient.
Heh, heh.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:43.812
I don't?

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.281
Can I help you?

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.581
I've always loved Carnegiea,
haven't you?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.457
Dr. Sayer.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.794
What is it, Anthony?
Did you choose this place?

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.045
Why?

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.505
I always come here.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.966
Why? I mean,
don't get me wrong, doc.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.259
This is a nice place.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:17.596
But after the first hour,
it loses something.

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:20.599
Anthony seems to think
the group is bored.

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.434
They are.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:25.312
I thought about taking them
to the opera house.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.355
The opera?

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:32.152
The Museum of Natural History...
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.280
Just a lot of dead stuffed things.
You know:

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.699
Oh, well, um...

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.785
Where else is there?

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:23.828
Is it legal again?
Yes, for some time.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:26.790
What can I get you?
Well...

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.918
A Rob Roy on the rocks.
A what?

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.379
Could you make that
a virgin Rob Roy?

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.679
I work the night shifts at this diner.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:45.517
So sometimes before work,
I'll come see my father.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.353
He used to go to all the games,

01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:52.440
so I like to read him
the sports pages.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.528
I don't even know if he knows
I visit him or not.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.447
My mother doesn't think so.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:01.866
But you do.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:08.039
Well, sometimes
I think I see something.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:11.167
You know, I think I see a change.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.463
And for a moment,
I see him like he was.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.549
You know, before the stroke.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:21.052
And then it's gone.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.972
I don't even know if I saw anything.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.266
Does that make any sense?

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.393
Yeah. Yes.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.568
Okay, my troop, back to the ward.

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.529
Come on. Danny.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:43.616
Bill, Deon. Come on.
Put your fork down. Let's go.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.745
So why are you here?

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.164
Come on, hurry up.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.583
I receive medication.

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:53.209
For what?

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.754
Let's go, come on.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.632
Without it,
I'm sort of like your father.

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:09.142
But I'm okay now.

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:11.644
That's good. Heh, heh.

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:36.920
Please. No. No.

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:41.383
I agree.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.834
Thank you, Rose. Ay!

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.336
And I was so sure

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.714
he was over-easy with bacon,
wheat toast and black coffee,

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:24.551
I brought him his food
without taking his order.

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:27.178
Know what he says?
"You forgot the tomato."

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.682
Did you bring it?
No. We were out of them.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.643
That's why I didn't get it
in the first place.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:38.523
Visiting hours
are from 3 to 6 every day.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.025
Good afternoon.
Bainbridge Hospital.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.736
Well...

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.698
it was really nice talking to you,
Leonard.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.533
It was nice talking to you too.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.705
Bye-bye.
Bye.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.125
Paula?
Yeah?

01:19:57.918 --> 01:19:58.960
He knows.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:01.754
Your father.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:03.631
He knows you visit him.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:10.597
Bainbridge Hospital.

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:12.932
See you.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.354
Well, I could interrupt.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.732
One moment, please.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:23.485
Come on. I want you
to meet a wonderful man.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:27.572
Can you believe this?
Doctor, these are my friends.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.240
Hello.
He's my doctor.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.117
Isn't he the cat's meow?

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:32.952
I wanna show you the sunroom.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:49.260
Miriam, I don't know how to tell you
this, so I'm just going to say it.

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.304
Your husband...

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:59.354
He was granted a divorce from you
in 1953.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.025
Thank God.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:12.450
Whoa. Look at that.
Pontiac Firebird 400 engine.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:15.787
Firebird.
Oh, now, that's a car.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.289
Morning, Lucy,
may I have your hand?

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.709
Take me away from this place.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:29.092
Rum. Right here.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.429
I guess I lose.
Well, I guess your luck is changing.

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:36.516
Very nice.

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:40.645
How's it going?
How's it going?

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.355
Yeah. How do you feel?

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.903
Well, my parents are dead,
my wife is in an institution,

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.992
my son has disappeared
out West somewhere.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.746
I feel old and I feel swindled.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.498
That's how I feel.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.171
I stopped by the hobby shop.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.757
I got more pencils.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.720
And I got this.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:17.223
A small T-square.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.183
That's Good.
Oh, I can use that.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.769
Oh, good, okay. Good.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.856
Let's start a new room.
Hi, Leonard.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.360
Hi.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.949
That's really nice.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.411
I'll be right back.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.205
Leonard.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:49.714
He never talked about girls before.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:53.801
He certainly never had
anything to do with them.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:58.681
It's a bit ridiculous,
all this girl business.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.392
Don't you think?
He's a grown man, Mrs. Lowe.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.895
You know what he said to me?

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:05.980
I should take a vacation.

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:09.067
I should go away for a few days
and relax.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:12.111
I'm sure he meant you deserve
a vacation, which you do.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.574
I can't leave him alone in this place.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.284
He'd die without me.

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:23.581
Girls.

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:37.929
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:39.806
Dr. Sayer?

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.101
Dr. Sayer, I've gotta talk to you.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:46.437
Leonard?
Yes. I think it's important...

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:50.024
I think it's important
some things were said that...

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.901
Well, I just gotta talk to you.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:53.319
What kind of things?

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.947
Things that matter,
that have happened to me,

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:58.783
things that I've come
to understand. Things.

01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:01.285
Where are you calling from,
Leonard?

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.121
Your office.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.289
It's very late.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.125
Is it?
Leonard.

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:11.129
You stay there, I'll be right over.
Good.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:22.306
Leonard? Leonard?

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.643
Dr. Sayer, sit down. Sit down.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.896
Why? What's wrong?

01:24:29.356 --> 01:24:32.150
We've got to tell everybody.
We've got to remind them.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:35.653
Remind them how good it is.
How good what is, Leonard?

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:42.076
Read the newspaper.
What does it say? All bad.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:43.494
It's all bad.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.582
People have forgotten what life's about.
Forgotten what it is to be alive.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.167
They need to be reminded.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.211
Reminded of what they have
and what they can lose.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:57.175
And what I feel is the joy of life,
the gift of life, the freedom of life,

01:24:57.342 --> 01:24:58.718
the wonderment of life.

01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:02.221
He kept saying that people
don't appreciate the simple things.

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:06.100
Work, play, friendship, family. It's...

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:09.979
And he was so excited,
he talked till 5:00 in the morning.

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:12.940
I don't know whether
this is liberation, mania...

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:16.194
Or love?
Yes.

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.864
What he's saying is right though.
We don't really know how to live.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:22.325
But at 5 in the morning...

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:25.203
Waheedah. How are you?

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.206
I'm fine.
Very good.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:51.562
Mr. Lowe? Are you all right?
Yeah.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.910
What is it that you want now?
The simplest thing.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.079
And that is?

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:14.627
To have the choice to go for a walk
if I want to, like any normal person.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.757
You are free to go for a walk.

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:23.094
I am? Alone?

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:27.390
What difference would that make?

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:29.600
Look, I'm not a criminal.

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:33.688
I've committed no crime,
I'm not a danger to myself or to others.

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:37.942
And yet, I'm still not allowed to go
for a walk on my own by myself.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.321
You didn't wake a thing,
you woke a person.

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:43.823
I am a person.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.743
Mr. Lowe, are you at all aware

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:51.831
of the unconscious hostility you're
exhibiting toward us right now?

01:26:51.999 --> 01:26:54.125
How can I be aware
if it's unconscious?

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:55.877
Nora, please.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:02.049
I'm curious. What would you
do if you went out?

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:09.557
I'd go for a walk, I'd look at things,
I'd talk to people.

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.643
I'd decide if I wanna go
in this direction, or that direction,

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:14.604
or straight ahead.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:17.481
I would do all the things
that you take for granted.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:23.321
And that's it?
That's it.

01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:30.453
All right, then, we'll certainly
take this into consideration,

01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:32.830
and we'll let you know.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:44.425
Dr. Sayer.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.013
Are you all right?
Yeah. I was aware of that.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:51.724
It was nothing. I was nervous.
What did they say?

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:57.188
They said there was
insufficient data at this time.

01:27:57.356 --> 01:28:01.901
That continued observation was
necessary for a complete diagnosis.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:06.072
They said it's a different world out there
and you may not be prepared for it.

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:09.617
They couldn't be held responsible
for what might happen to you.

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:12.203
They said no.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:20.211
And what did you say?

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:24.215
They don't have to listen to me.
Did you agree with them?

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.385
Yes.

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:33.474
Leonard, I don't think
we're out of the woods yet.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.394
I'm not sure that this is nothing.

01:28:36.687 --> 01:28:38.229
It's an experimental drug.

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:40.564
We need time
to evaluate things before...

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:44.068
Bye.
Leonard.

01:28:44.403 --> 01:28:45.903
Leonard.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.906
Leonard, where are you going?

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:50.658
For a walk.

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:54.245
Leonard. Leonard.

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:01.168
This is Dr. Sayer.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.754
Dorquez, please call the pharmacy.

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:06.257
Miss Dorquez,
call the pharmacy, please.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.598
Where are you going?
I'm going outside.

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:17.101
No. Patients not allowed
beyond this point.

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.103
I'm going for a walk.
No, no. I'm sorry.

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:22.189
Please, don't make it hard
on yourself.

01:29:24.151 --> 01:29:26.819
- I got him. I got him.
- Leonard, stop.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:29.947
- I just wanna go for a walk.
- He's not a mental patient.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:33.617
This is unnecessary. Let him go.
Please, he's not violent.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:36.245
He's not violent.
He is not a mental patient.

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:39.665
Will you let go? You will hurt him.
Will you let go of him?

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.377
Will you stop, please?
Let go of him.

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:47.923
I don't understand it.
He was never any trouble before.

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:51.469
He was quiet and polite
and respectful.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.637
He never demanded anything.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.473
He was never disobedient.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.892
Because he was catatonic,
Mrs. Lowe.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.979
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:05.357
I'm sorry.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:08.402
I don't know who that is up there.

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:11.030
I don't think he knows.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:14.825
You've turned Leonard
into something he's not.

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:19.497
It's not us that's defective, it's them.
We're not in crisis, they are.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.248
- Yeah.
- They are.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:24.335
We've been through the worst
and survived. They haven't.

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:27.588
They fear it. They fear it.
Right.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.174
- Because they know.
- They know. They know.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.343
- They know.
- They know.

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:33.928
They know, they know

01:30:34.096 --> 01:30:37.681
because we remind them...

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.186
We remind them
that there's a problem...

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:45.189
There's a problem
that they don't have an answer to.

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:48.651
And they'll never be healers
until they realize this,

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:54.240
until they start to see the problem,
until they admit there is a problem.

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:57.618
And that the problem isn't us.
We're not the problem.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.954
It's them. They're the problem!

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:03.541
It's them!
They're the problem.

01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:05.793
They're the problem.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.922
They're the problem!
They're the problem! It's them!

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:12.299
They're the problem!

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:18.139
He's lived 30 years
without the ability to release anger.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.473
As have the others.

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:22.393
I think his behavior
is more natural than the others.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:26.689
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia,
these are signs of normal behavior?

01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:29.275
Yeah, because he's in that place.
Oh, is that it?

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:32.153
Yes, we wake him up
and then lock him up in a cage.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.780
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.

01:31:34.948 --> 01:31:38.284
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics
up there refusing to eat.

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:41.245
Now, they have no idea
why they're refusing to eat.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:45.082
How long should I let that go on?
He knows why. He wants out.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:48.711
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not
the messiah of Ward 5.

01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:50.963
He's a man in trouble.

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:54.133
He wasn't resurrected,
he was administered a drug by you.

01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:57.261
A drug that's fallen short
of its miraculous reputation.

01:31:57.429 --> 01:31:59.555
The others are fine.
They show no signs...

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:01.432
He's been on it longer, doctor.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:08.898
Now, I sympathize with him,
I've tried to accommodate him.

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:12.776
But I will not let him endanger
the health of the rest of the patients.

01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.784
It will help if you wait for me
out there.

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:22.369
Thank you.

01:32:23.914 --> 01:32:25.122
Excuse me.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.625
- Excuse me.
- We can't allow it.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:29.877
He's all right.

01:32:33.465 --> 01:32:35.090
He's all right.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.770
How are you today?

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.731
I'm all right. How are you?

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:53.901
Never better.

01:32:56.529 --> 01:32:58.489
What's the purpose
of these gentlemen?

01:32:58.657 --> 01:33:01.992
Oh, these gentlemen protect me.

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:05.996
I wish I didn't need them.
Someone's trying to hurt you?

01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:08.999
Who?
Who? Heh, heh.

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:11.669
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:15.422
One never knows.
Someone I least expect, I expect.

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:18.008
Look at history.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:23.013
Leonard, every patient on this ward
thinks there's a plot against him.

01:33:23.348 --> 01:33:25.182
They're mistaken, they're crazy.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.066
You've gotten worse.

01:33:37.696 --> 01:33:39.863
The drug's not working.

01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:44.576
All these things you're experiencing
are side effects.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.287
They're making you behave this way.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:49.540
I appreciate you coming to see me,
but I have things to do.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:52.251
Leonard, Leonard,
please, look at yourself.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:55.713
No, look at yourself.
I have a sickness.

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:59.883
Sickness took me out of the world,
and I fought to come back.

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:05.639
I fought for 30 years, 30 years,
and I'm still fighting.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.725
But you have no excuse.
Me?

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:10.436
Nothing to do with me.
You have no excuse.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:13.230
You're just a scared and lonely man
with nothing.

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:16.275
No life, nothing.
You're the one that's asleep.

01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:21.655
Your medicine could be taken away.
They can do that.

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:26.702
You could wake up in the morning
and it won't be there.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:32.291
Leonard.

01:34:33.043 --> 01:34:34.752
Get away from me!

01:34:51.353 --> 01:34:54.146
I'm all right. Thank you.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:57.191
I just fell. I'm fine.

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:01.899
Sayer.

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.543
Help me.

01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:40.521
Can you walk?

01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:44.608
I won't let them take
the medicine away, Leonard.

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.777
We'll work together with it.

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:53.742
All we're saying is you're taking
an unnecessary risk.

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:57.454
He's had a reaction to the drug.
He has acquired some tics.

01:37:57.622 --> 01:38:00.499
But he's not as concerned
with his appearance

01:38:00.667 --> 01:38:03.627
as the affect it may have
upon the other patients.

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:06.129
We'll be working with his dosage.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:08.465
He's aware,
and he's prepared for any effects.

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:10.801
But he wants the others
to be prepared as well.

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:15.055
- You've gotta help me with this.
- Yes, doctor. Okay.

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:30.362
Hey, Len.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.322
Welcome back.
Thanks.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:37.578
Hi, Leonard.
How you doing?

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.454
How you feeling?
You all right?

01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:42.833
Gee, it's swell to see you.
What's up, Bert?

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:48.255
It got so quiet around here.
Ha, ha. Because we're waiting for you.

01:38:57.682 --> 01:39:00.100
That's wonderful, Miriam.

01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:06.523
You're looking good, Len.
You're looking better every day.

01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:07.983
Yeah?

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:15.991
What if he's just had enough of it?

01:39:16.159 --> 01:39:19.369
What if it's just a matter of time
for all of us?

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:24.916
There's no reason to think

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:27.753
what's happening to Leonard
will happen to you.

01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:29.254
Why not?

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:33.050
Well, you're all individuals.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:36.094
And you're well.

01:39:37.055 --> 01:39:38.930
Aren't you?
Yes.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.990
That was lovely, Lucy.

01:39:57.659 --> 01:40:01.912
I learned that song
a long, long time ago.

01:40:05.458 --> 01:40:07.250
I know what year it is.

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:13.757
I just can't imagine
being older than 22.

01:40:14.092 --> 01:40:15.926
I've no experience at it.

01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:20.931
I know it's not 1926.

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.310
I just need it to be.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.202
How are you, Leonard?

01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:44.830
Never better.

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:53.296
How are the others?
Are they talking about me?

01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:55.215
They're scared.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.467
Well, they should be.

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:04.391
Can you stop this?

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:06.476
I'm not sure, but I'm trying.

01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:09.938
Don't give up on me.
I won't.

01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:25.495
Four twenty-five, yes.
Four twenty-five. Okay.

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:28.999
Here we go, 425.

01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:34.921
I got a postcard from my son.

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:37.340
I'm all right,
and then everything stops.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:39.843
Look at this,
I got a postcard from my son.

01:41:40.011 --> 01:41:42.512
No warning,
it's like a light switch going off.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.014
It happens that fast.

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.475
Something has to happen
to bring me back.

01:41:46.642 --> 01:41:49.603
A sound or a touch.

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:52.606
And then I can move again,
I'm okay again.

01:41:52.774 --> 01:41:54.316
Thanks.

01:41:58.321 --> 01:42:01.239
It's not that it feels bad,
it's just that it's nothing.

01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:05.076
I feel nothing, like I'm dead.

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:11.208
Nothing.

01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:14.544
Gets to be like I'm not
a person anymore.

01:42:14.712 --> 01:42:17.214
Just a collection of tics.

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:20.258
Not that I mind them necessarily.

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:23.094
Sometimes they make life
kind of interesting.

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:25.972
Though I'm not sure who's in control,
me or them.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:29.392
What I do mind is knowing
that they shouldn't be there.

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:32.646
Back to 5.

01:42:32.814 --> 01:42:34.898
Okay. Five. Five.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:46.284
Just a little more. Just...
Okay, all right.

01:42:46.702 --> 01:42:49.955
It feels good when I'm working.
I feel good here.

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:54.292
Book list is coming along well.
I'd love to see it.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:56.461
It's here somewhere.

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:04.386
That's all right,
some other time.

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:10.141
Leonard. Leonard.
Ugh!

01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:13.937
What's happening?
You're having an oculogyric crisis.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:15.605
Get the camera.

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:18.316
Get the camera.
Get the camera.

01:43:18.484 --> 01:43:20.360
Oh, God.

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.288
I can't do this.
I'm turning the camera off.

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:32.956
No, no. Watch, watch, watch.

01:43:33.124 --> 01:43:35.000
Watch, watch, watch.

01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:41.464
Learn, learn, learn.

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:44.175
Learn for me. Learn.

01:43:44.886 --> 01:43:46.636
Let's see this

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:51.766
- Six twenty-five.
- All right, 625.

01:43:51.934 --> 01:43:55.061
Six seventy-five, if... Just...
Six seventy-five.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:56.313
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:44:13.039 --> 01:44:14.831
I can't read anymore.

01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:17.792
I can't keep my eyes in one place.

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.503
I keep going back
to the beginning, beginning,

01:44:20.671 --> 01:44:22.881
beginning, beginning,
beginning...

01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:28.011
I've let everybody down. I have.
No.

01:44:28.179 --> 01:44:30.180
I've let you down.
No, you have not.

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:34.351
I have, I have. I'm grotesque.
You are not. It's not true.

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:37.312
I won't listen to you talk like this.
I'm grotesque. Look at me.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.731
Look, and tell me I am not.
Tell me I'm not.

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:42.108
You're not.
Well, this isn't me.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.694
This is... This isn't me.

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:03.880
When my son was born healthy,
I never asked why.

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:06.508
Why was I so lucky?

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:10.303
What did I do to deserve
this perfect child?

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:12.722
This perfect life?

01:45:13.015 --> 01:45:14.391
But when he got sick,

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:18.186
you can bet I asked why,
I demanded to know why.

01:45:18.354 --> 01:45:20.772
Why was this happening?

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:27.946
There was nothing I could do about it.
No one I could go to and say:

01:45:28.114 --> 01:45:34.577
"Stop this. Please, stop this.
Can't you see my son is in pain?"

01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:40.417
My son is in pain. Please, stop this.

01:45:41.711 --> 01:45:44.587
He's fighting, Mrs. Lowe.
He's losing.

01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:12.282
Here you go.

01:46:12.575 --> 01:46:14.826
Uh, I worked,

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:18.246
had friends over, went dancing.

01:46:18.414 --> 01:46:20.331
That's about it, not much.

01:46:20.499 --> 01:46:22.292
That's great, you know.

01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:26.838
I've never done any of those things.
You will.

01:46:30.259 --> 01:46:33.136
They'll never let me out
of this place.

01:46:36.057 --> 01:46:37.974
And they shouldn't.

01:46:39.852 --> 01:46:45.315
I am still not well, as you can see.

01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:54.491
You know,
I feel well when I see you.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:01.122
And...

01:47:17.306 --> 01:47:20.558
I won't see you anymore.

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:36.741
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:48:01.058 --> 01:48:02.475
Look.

01:48:33.007 --> 01:48:35.425
Isn't that sweet?

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:58.651
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

01:51:00.571 --> 01:51:02.405
My name is Leonard Lowe.

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:06.367
It has been explained to me
that I have been away

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:08.161
for quite some time.

01:51:10.456 --> 01:51:11.748
I'm back.

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:15.251
What's it like to be back?

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:19.547
I thought it was a dream at first.

01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:22.592
What made you realize
it wasn't a dream?

01:51:24.595 --> 01:51:27.263
When I spoke
and you understood me.

01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:51.662
You told him I was a kind man.

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:56.793
How kind is it to give life

01:51:57.336 --> 01:51:59.796
only to take it away again?

01:52:01.507 --> 01:52:04.384
It's given and taken away
from all of us.

01:52:07.304 --> 01:52:09.555
Why doesn't that comfort me?

01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:14.310
Because you are a kind man.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:29.200
Because he's your friend.

01:53:05.529 --> 01:53:07.989
The summer was extraordinary.

01:53:08.157 --> 01:53:11.367
It was a season of rebirth
and innocence.

01:53:11.535 --> 01:53:13.202
A miracle

01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:17.707
for 15 patients and for us,
their caretakers.

01:53:18.375 --> 01:53:22.712
But now we have to adjust
to the realities of miracles.

01:53:24.047 --> 01:53:27.884
We can hide behind the veil of
science and say the drug failed.

01:53:28.218 --> 01:53:31.053
Or that the illness itself
had returned.

01:53:31.221 --> 01:53:36.726
Or that the patients were unable to cope
with losing decades of their lives.

01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:40.062
But the reality is
we don't know what went wrong

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:42.773
any more than we know
what went right.

01:53:43.984 --> 01:53:49.405
What we do know is,
as the chemical window closed,

01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:54.035
another awakening took place.

01:53:57.915 --> 01:54:02.835
That the human spirit
is more powerful than any drug.

01:54:04.588 --> 01:54:07.590
And that is what needs
to be nourished.

01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:15.806
With work, play, friendship, family.

01:54:18.352 --> 01:54:20.603
These are the things that matter.

01:54:23.357 --> 01:54:25.733
This is what we'd forgotten.

01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:32.740
The simplest things.

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:44.043
Well, ahem, good night.

01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:45.753
Good night.

01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:41.350
Eleanor!
Yes?

01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:43.853
Um...

01:55:53.614 --> 01:55:55.615
Eleanor? Um...

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:57.450
What's wrong?

01:55:58.869 --> 01:56:01.871
I was wondering,
what are you doing tonight?

01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:04.999
If you have other plans, I...

01:56:05.167 --> 01:56:07.418
No, I was...
Because I was wondering...

01:56:07.586 --> 01:56:10.713
You have no plans?
No, I have no, uh...

01:56:10.881 --> 01:56:12.882
Because I was wondering if you...

01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:16.844
We... Well, you and I could, um...

01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:22.558
If we could, um,
go for a cup of coffee.

01:56:24.227 --> 01:56:25.728
Yes.

01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:28.022
I'd love to.

01:56:35.530 --> 01:56:37.239
My car is over here.

01:56:37.407 --> 01:56:40.076
What do you say we just walk?

01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:41.827
Okay.

01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:22.201
Let's begin.
