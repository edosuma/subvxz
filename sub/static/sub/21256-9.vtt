you, romantic feelings.

00:12.632 --> 00:14.166

10:15.634 --> 10:17.468
It went in to remission.

10:19.405 --> 10:21.239
But it's back now.

10:24.443 --> 10:27.478
And the prognosis... is not good.

10:30.416 --> 10:32.050
So...

10:32.084 --> 10:34.552
I'm gonna take my daughter back,

10:34.586 --> 10:38.723
and she's gonna undergo
a few rounds of chemo.

10:38.757 --> 10:40.658
And we're gonna hope for the best.

10:44.930 --> 10:46.998
Please don't tell her I told you.

10:54.408 --> 10:56.902
The limo is here you
guys. Let's go, chop-chop.

10:58.232 --> 11:00.567
(SIGHS) I forgot to tell
you who else is chaperoning.

11:00.601 --> 11:02.002
- Hmm?
- Tess.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.203
(CHUCKLES)

11:03.237 --> 11:04.871
Well, I'm sorry I can't make it,

11:04.906 --> 11:06.706
but it's not a school
sanctioned dance, so...

11:06.741 --> 11:10.577
Yeah. I'm sure that
you're very, very sorry.

11:10.611 --> 11:13.079
Maybe Tess can tell me more
about how straight she is.

11:13.114 --> 11:15.248
I don't understand why
this bothers you so much.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.716
You're the one who
always points out that...

11:16.751 --> 11:19.019
that the crush you had on
her wasn't reciprocated.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.922
Hello, handsome!

11:21.956 --> 11:24.291
You look like you're going
to a firing squad, not a prom.

11:24.325 --> 11:25.759
- Hey!
- I don't have a date,

11:25.793 --> 11:27.394
I can't dance, and I'm
probably gonna see Emma,

11:27.428 --> 11:29.029
- so I wish I was going to a firing squad.
- Funny.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.230
Woo-hoo! Here they come!

11:30.264 --> 11:33.233
You're the next contestant
on "Who's Going to the Prom?"

11:33.267 --> 11:34.768
- Wow!
- Come on, ladies!

11:34.802 --> 11:36.670
- Okay, pictures please!
- You look great!

11:36.704 --> 11:37.871
Uh, so, just so we're clear,

11:37.905 --> 11:39.940
you're not riding in
the limo with us, right?

11:39.974 --> 11:43.076
Just to be clear, you're welcome
for chaperoning your rebel prom.

11:43.110 --> 11:44.511
So, that will be torture enough.

11:44.545 --> 11:46.346
- I will drive myself.

- Uh, no, that's Callie's.

Mine's meeting us at the prom.

12:05.116 --> 12:07.150

beautiful corsage though.

- Did I say something?

- I was there.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.345
I saw him.

21:21.379 --> 21:23.147
I thought you weren't going.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.882
What? So you went with him?

21:25.884 --> 21:27.985
No, I didn't go with him.

21:28.019 --> 21:29.320
He came on his own.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.189
I don't appreciate being spied on.

21:32.223 --> 21:33.591
I was worried about you.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.092
I can take care of myself.

21:35.126 --> 21:37.461
And if you saw me with AJ,

21:37.495 --> 21:40.164
all you had to do was ask
what he was doing there.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.266
You don't have to...

21:42.300 --> 21:44.902
play games or try to trap me in a lie.

21:46.404 --> 21:48.339
And you don't have to
be threatened by him.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.377
Is that why you're not
taking the internship?

21:53.411 --> 21:54.478
Cause you don't trust me?

21:54.512 --> 21:56.547
Well, it was pretty easy
for me to steal you from him,

21:56.581 --> 21:58.449
so how hard could it be

22:01.286 --> 22:03.520
I am not a piece of property.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.623
You didn't steal me from anyone.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.893

think of me, then this is done.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.937
- Hey. So, I'm back.
- Hey.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.706
- I was wondering if you'd like to...
- Aren't we gonna dance?

22:21.741 --> 22:23.174

Yes, I was wondering
if you'd like to, um...

22:35.321 --> 22:38.056

that we're having later.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.326

Basically, Logan's girlfriend
thinks I'm after him,

23:36.182 --> 23:38.950
so I asked Wyatt to be
my pretend ex-boyfriend

23:38.984 --> 23:40.852
who I'm back with, but...

23:40.886 --> 23:42.454
he's loaded.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.389

26:19.945 --> 26:21.846
And I didn't say anything then,

26:21.881 --> 26:23.548
because it wasn't a firm offer.

But it is now.

It's a new charter.
