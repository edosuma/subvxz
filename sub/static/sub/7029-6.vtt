00:00.909 --> 00:03.580
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.580 --> 00:05.950
that famous stone is it on the island it

00:05.950 --> 00:07.850
was in chime phrase when I thought if

00:07.850 --> 00:09.330
these are part of a bigger puzzle we've

00:09.330 --> 00:11.750
got three new pieces let's see what we

00:11.750 --> 00:14.820
found here do you think he's an art all

00:14.820 --> 00:16.104
right these two pieces seem to be part

00:16.104 --> 00:19.070
of the same stone you could probably

00:19.070 --> 00:21.194
match them right up what we got a 5 when

00:21.194 --> 00:22.619
we drill these homes the chambers were

00:22.619 --> 00:27.250
the real treasures if he put an X on the

00:27.250 --> 00:31.340
spot this was good work on Diaz Jack

00:31.340 --> 00:32.340
Empire

00:32.340 --> 00:35.300
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:35.300 --> 00:37.000
where people have been looking for an

00:37.000 --> 00:40.289
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:40.289 --> 00:43.770
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.770 --> 00:47.370
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:47.370 --> 00:50.809
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.809 --> 00:54.789
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.789 --> 00:59.329
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:59.329 --> 01:02.564
and according to legend one more will

01:02.564 --> 01:07.860
have to die before the treasure 
can be found

01:19.120 --> 01:21.990
while the process of exploring 10x has

01:21.990 --> 01:25.930
been temporarily put on hold Rick lagina

01:25.930 --> 01:28.520
has decided to focus his attention on

01:28.520 --> 01:30.840
the hundreds of strange carvings that

01:30.840 --> 01:33.920
have been found all over the island

01:33.920 --> 01:37.100
carvings that may provide information

01:37.100 --> 01:39.840
not only as to where treasure could lie

01:39.840 --> 01:43.250
buried but who buried it and perhaps

01:43.250 --> 01:48.470
even more important what it is Rick

01:48.470 --> 01:50.840
lagina knows there is no better source

01:50.840 --> 01:53.350
of information about Oak Island and its

01:53.350 --> 01:56.240
history than his friend and partner dan

01:56.240 --> 02:00.430
Blankenship at 92 dan has spent more

02:00.430 --> 02:03.150
than 50 years determined to solve the

02:03.150 --> 02:05.110
220 year old mystery

02:05.110 --> 02:07.880
dad

02:13.680 --> 02:17.340
got a question for you Ally you can if

02:17.340 --> 02:20.640
you want okay but I'm gonna catch you

02:20.640 --> 02:23.790
you know those thats stolen the H or the

02:23.790 --> 02:26.780
famous H o stone oh yeah is it on the

02:26.780 --> 02:29.250
island that's the first question not

02:29.250 --> 02:32.070
that I know of rich I remember it many

02:32.070 --> 02:35.110
years ago and it was on the island when

02:35.110 --> 02:37.750
I was doing drilling on on that field

02:37.750 --> 02:40.230
and I don't know maybe about 20 years or

02:40.230 --> 02:42.080
so it just disappeared

02:42.080 --> 02:46.450
in 1921 a huge boulder covered with

02:46.450 --> 02:48.980
carved inscriptions was found on the

02:48.980 --> 02:51.930
northern shore of Oak Island believing

02:51.930 --> 02:53.650
it might have been placed there to mark

02:53.650 --> 02:56.430
the location of buried treasure

02:56.430 --> 02:59.150
searchers demolished it using dynamite

02:59.150 --> 03:02.150
and dug underneath it although nothing

03:02.150 --> 03:05.791
was found in 1936 treasure hunter

03:05.791 --> 03:08.440
Gilbert Hedden saved some of the larger

03:08.440 --> 03:11.520
fragments including one which featured

03:11.520 --> 03:15.270
an H a cross and a circle with a dot in

03:15.270 --> 03:17.630
the center

03:17.630 --> 03:19.069
I don't know what to make all these

03:19.069 --> 03:21.550
inscribe stones who found them when they

03:21.550 --> 03:23.410
found them none of that is well

03:23.410 --> 03:26.010
documented correct we don't know where

03:26.010 --> 03:27.459
they came from

03:27.459 --> 03:31.120
there's urban myths about them so you

03:31.120 --> 03:33.620
know we're gonna leave no stone unturned

03:33.620 --> 03:36.160
are you certain that it's gone I haven't

03:36.160 --> 03:40.670
seen it I've never seen it I've never

03:40.670 --> 03:42.500
seen it so you don't know if someone

03:42.500 --> 03:45.400
took it so it could be still there

03:45.400 --> 03:48.040
someone had to move it I mean it didn't

03:48.040 --> 03:50.090
move by itself they're big yeah

03:50.090 --> 03:53.310
I asked Nolan if he had taken it then he

03:53.310 --> 03:54.700
said no you didn't take it

03:54.700 --> 03:57.780
just like he didn't take them big rocks

03:57.780 --> 04:01.060
huh uh-huh rocks are those the ones that

04:01.060 --> 04:03.000
are concreted into his floor three

04:03.000 --> 04:05.810
there's three in there Oh in there's

04:05.810 --> 04:09.599
stones in the floor of the museum a land

04:09.599 --> 04:12.730
surveyor by trade Fred Nolan came to Oak

04:12.730 --> 04:17.089
Island in 1961 working in cooperation

04:17.089 --> 04:19.860
with landowner Mr Chappell and treasure

04:19.860 --> 04:22.440
hunter Robert Restall he helps survey

04:22.440 --> 04:26.860
virtually every inch of the 140 acre

04:26.860 --> 04:28.350
Island

04:28.350 --> 04:31.860
in 1963 Noland purchased a large number

04:31.860 --> 04:34.620
of acres near the islands north shore

04:34.620 --> 04:38.300
and in 1969 he built a small Museum on

04:38.300 --> 04:42.110
the mainland just across the causeway

04:42.110 --> 04:44.050
there he displayed evidence he had

04:44.050 --> 04:46.860
accumulated for nearly a decade

04:46.860 --> 04:49.830
including artifacts pictures and news

04:49.830 --> 04:52.000
articles about the search for treasure

04:52.000 --> 04:55.160
on Oak Island and in the center on the

04:55.160 --> 04:58.210
floor he embedded several large stones

04:58.210 --> 05:01.310
in concrete stones he had removed from

05:01.310 --> 05:02.310
the island

05:02.310 --> 05:05.250
although Noland closed the museum in

05:05.250 --> 05:08.640
1990 and later sold the property he left

05:08.640 --> 05:11.900
the stones still embedded in the floor

05:11.900 --> 05:13.010
could one of them have been the

05:13.010 --> 05:16.970
mysterious H o stone great put them

05:16.970 --> 05:18.631
stones in concrete over there in the

05:18.631 --> 05:19.631
middle of his floor

05:19.631 --> 05:22.190
why don't I know one that it did I'm

05:22.190 --> 05:24.460
wondering if it has something to do with

05:24.460 --> 05:27.400
the stone triangle since it was fine I

05:27.400 --> 05:29.460
would be surprised if it did not have

05:29.460 --> 05:32.610
something to do with the stone triangle

05:32.610 --> 05:35.970
in 1897 treasure hunter Frederick Blair

05:35.970 --> 05:38.610
discovered a mysterious triangle made of

05:38.610 --> 05:42.320
round stones on oak islands South Shore

05:42.320 --> 05:44.000
each of the sides of the triangle

05:44.000 --> 05:47.210
measured 10 feet long and its apex

05:47.210 --> 05:49.880
pointed TrueNorth directly toward the

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
money pit

05:50.880 --> 05:53.640
although it was destroyed by Robert

05:53.640 --> 05:56.710
dunfield's extensive excavations there

05:56.710 --> 05:59.220
are many who believe that it and the

05:59.220 --> 06:01.140
numerous other carved stones on the

06:01.140 --> 06:03.530
island offered important clues to

06:03.530 --> 06:07.690
solving the Oak Island mystery dan do

06:07.690 --> 06:09.790
you know who owns the property now yeah

06:09.790 --> 06:12.290
by the name of public cover we should go

06:12.290 --> 06:15.180
check it out hey babe it's still there

06:15.180 --> 06:16.820
hey it's one more piece of the puzzle

06:16.820 --> 06:20.960
how many times I need 300 for a 300

06:20.960 --> 06:23.770
piece puzzle let's go see if we can make

06:23.770 --> 06:25.550
that happen yeah I think that's a good

06:25.550 --> 06:26.550
idea

06:26.550 --> 06:28.450
all righty what see you later dad okay

06:28.450 --> 06:30.860
Dave there's a story here first and

06:30.860 --> 06:32.360
foremost it's always been that way for

06:32.360 --> 06:34.560
me when I was a little boy tonight

06:34.560 --> 06:36.360
I wanted to know those I wanted the

06:36.360 --> 06:39.169
answers to those questions as of yet we

06:39.169 --> 06:49.290
have a phone

06:49.290 --> 06:51.740
after placing a call to Barry and Karen

06:51.740 --> 06:54.430
public cover the owners of what was once

06:54.430 --> 06:57.050
Fred Nolan's Oak Island Museum we ready

06:57.050 --> 07:00.460
to do this

07:00.460 --> 07:02.870
Rick lagina along with Dave Blankenship

07:02.870 --> 07:05.290
and Jack Begley head over to the place

07:05.290 --> 07:07.720
where they believe important clues might

07:07.720 --> 07:11.270
lie cemented into the floor they have

07:11.270 --> 07:13.650
made arrangements to remove the stones

07:13.650 --> 07:16.540
and return them to the island that is if

07:16.540 --> 07:18.940
they can pry them loose without causing

07:18.940 --> 07:21.720
any damage you bought the property from

07:21.720 --> 07:24.060
Fred right when when you purchased it

07:24.060 --> 07:26.570
did he relate anything about it or where

07:26.570 --> 07:28.980
he found it how it came to be well he

07:28.980 --> 07:31.230
told us they were very valuable to the

07:31.230 --> 07:33.030
Oak Island story and that he had found

07:33.030 --> 07:35.390
them on the island and wanted to keep

07:35.390 --> 07:37.520
them where they would be safe forever so

07:37.520 --> 07:38.950
we mounted them in concrete in the

07:38.950 --> 07:48.160
middle of the building by all means

07:48.160 --> 07:53.310
we bought the property were peeking in

07:53.310 --> 07:55.830
through the window looking at this going

07:55.830 --> 08:00.570
what what can this be we think there are

08:00.570 --> 08:02.840
actually three here are they laid out in

08:02.840 --> 08:06.240
any specific way he didn't indicate that

08:06.240 --> 08:09.479
but Fred is very very into the way rocks

08:09.479 --> 08:12.790
point on his property and every rock on

08:12.790 --> 08:15.100
his property he feels this pointing that

08:15.100 --> 08:17.919
direction for a reason

08:17.919 --> 08:20.270
so he may have done that that wouldn't

08:20.270 --> 08:22.880
surprise me that's why I asked she may

08:22.880 --> 08:25.180
have laid him specifically examined

08:25.180 --> 08:28.460
something to him or maybe that's how he

08:28.460 --> 08:30.460
found him I think Fred Nolan is an

08:30.460 --> 08:31.800
absolute true believer

08:31.800 --> 08:34.610
he's as obsessed as anybody else but he

08:34.610 --> 08:37.349
has to fight internally in himself to

08:37.349 --> 08:38.990
release all this stuff that he kept so

08:38.990 --> 08:41.339
private for so long we're only guessing

08:41.339 --> 08:43.509
all of us know other than the fact that

08:43.509 --> 08:44.670
you say that Fred felt they weren't

08:44.670 --> 08:53.170
important oh well obviously no there

08:53.170 --> 08:55.399
could be some markings on the underside

08:55.399 --> 08:57.399
no well if you do grab that jacket we

08:57.399 --> 08:59.089
can find out what's on the other side of

08:59.089 --> 09:00.999
them all right

09:00.999 --> 09:02.809
like most things regarding Oak Island

09:02.809 --> 09:06.670
nothing's easy Fred had put in concrete

09:06.670 --> 09:09.069
for God's sake so you don't know we have

09:09.069 --> 09:11.779
to jackhammer moat but it's interesting

09:11.779 --> 09:13.420
that he felt that they were that

09:13.420 --> 09:16.779
important to make certain they were

09:16.779 --> 09:18.420
preserved or not lost

09:18.420 --> 09:23.600
Hey

09:23.600 --> 09:36.680
today it would be nice there you go

09:36.680 --> 09:40.120
on the mainland just across the causeway

09:40.120 --> 09:42.850
from Oak Island Rick lagina Dave

09:42.850 --> 09:45.490
Blankenship and Jack Begley are in the

09:45.490 --> 09:47.889
process of removing three large stones

09:47.889 --> 09:57.619
embedded in concrete giving an I are old

09:57.619 --> 09:59.730
man but you know what when Jack

09:59.730 --> 10:02.139
relinquished the the jackhammer David

10:02.139 --> 10:04.389
stepped right in as he always does I

10:04.389 --> 10:06.249
mean he's right there on the spot

10:06.249 --> 10:08.259
willing to do whatever whenever you may

10:08.259 --> 10:11.139
need sweating bullets no disrespect to

10:11.139 --> 10:14.079
Jack but you know kudos to David okay

10:14.079 --> 10:17.459
dude let's see what we found here if we

10:17.459 --> 10:21.679
found anything ready let's see what do

10:21.679 --> 10:27.550
you see you nice Roman numeral yeah look

10:27.550 --> 10:36.850
at one and maybe x and x you're right

10:36.850 --> 10:39.819
that's definitely carved away why the

10:39.819 --> 10:43.410
app you have a little bit of water left

10:43.410 --> 10:51.660
what were those do you think this is a

10:51.660 --> 10:55.399
not P or P

10:55.399 --> 10:59.050
re it looks like

10:59.050 --> 11:03.529
ar e could this stone be one of the

11:03.529 --> 11:06.440
fragments of the huge boulder that also

11:06.440 --> 11:10.129
included the missing a Joe stone just

11:10.129 --> 11:12.089
maybe it's part of the H o stone and

11:12.089 --> 11:13.519
maybe if these are part of a bigger

11:13.519 --> 11:15.449
puzzle we've got three new pieces

11:15.449 --> 11:17.179
they're big and they're heavy yeah and

11:17.179 --> 11:18.489
they don't always fit together but at

11:18.489 --> 11:22.130
least there's three more I think what we

11:22.130 --> 11:25.110
need to do is find an expert not only to

11:25.110 --> 11:27.019
look at the carvings themselves but to

11:27.019 --> 11:29.279
get the carvings to become more visible

11:29.279 --> 11:32.439
I mean somebody who knows what they're

11:32.439 --> 11:35.899
looking at

11:35.899 --> 11:40.050
after an exciting day on the mainland

11:40.050 --> 11:42.439
Rick lagina is once again focused on

11:42.439 --> 11:45.269
what is perhaps the biggest clue of all

11:45.269 --> 11:48.930
the money pit into this end he and Dave

11:48.930 --> 11:51.199
Blankenship have brought underwater

11:51.199 --> 11:53.860
visualization expert Brian Abbott back

11:53.860 --> 11:56.910
to the island so Brian I'm you know

11:56.910 --> 11:58.110
obviously glad you're back

11:58.110 --> 12:00.110
okay thanks of course the issue is

12:00.110 --> 12:04.660
valley 3 we'll all right earlier this

12:04.660 --> 12:06.199
year Brian Abbott

12:06.199 --> 12:09.179
used to scanning sonar to confirm data

12:09.179 --> 12:11.730
suggesting that a man-made chamber

12:11.730 --> 12:14.139
complete with wooden posts and possibly

12:14.139 --> 12:17.149
human remains are lying at the bottom of

12:17.149 --> 12:21.699
borehole 10x now Brian has been invited

12:21.699 --> 12:24.860
back to put a similar device down a hole

12:24.860 --> 12:28.110
that lies near the original money pit

12:28.110 --> 12:30.450
the same hole were Rick Craig and the

12:30.450 --> 12:32.940
team found evidence of the mysterious

12:32.940 --> 12:35.290
wooden vault that was first discovered

12:35.290 --> 12:37.310
by treasure hunters Frederick Blair and

12:37.310 --> 12:40.929
William Chappell back in 1897 you think

12:40.929 --> 12:45.189
you're on the vault

12:45.189 --> 12:47.360
rictus humming that if Brian can get

12:47.360 --> 12:50.049
images that prove there is a 7-foot tall

12:50.049 --> 12:52.139
wooden vault down near the bottom of the

12:52.139 --> 12:55.040
money pit he can convince Marty and

12:55.040 --> 12:57.279
their partners to dig it up using a

12:57.279 --> 13:00.110
relatively experimental method known as

13:00.110 --> 13:02.350
a freeze ring a freeze ring is probably

13:02.350 --> 13:05.100
the technology we would utilize if we

13:05.100 --> 13:08.129
saw target in there it's not a new idea

13:08.129 --> 13:10.540
there was a study by some engineering

13:10.540 --> 13:13.040
students actually McGill University and

13:13.040 --> 13:14.689
McGill so we've known about it but it's

13:14.689 --> 13:18.540
very very expensive because digging in

13:18.540 --> 13:20.899
the money pit area is likely to cause

13:20.899 --> 13:23.730
flooding at any depth below 60 to 90

13:23.730 --> 13:26.100
feet the freeze ring method would

13:26.100 --> 13:28.519
literally freeze any modern water that

13:28.519 --> 13:30.959
surrounds the excavated area and could

13:30.959 --> 13:34.440
cause it to collapse in the case of the

13:34.440 --> 13:36.930
wooden vault a series of holes would be

13:36.930 --> 13:38.929
drilled in a circular pattern

13:38.929 --> 13:42.859
approximately 150 feet deep then a

13:42.859 --> 13:45.670
cooling agent such as glycol would be

13:45.670 --> 13:48.649
pumped into each hole literally freezing

13:48.649 --> 13:51.369
the ground solid and allowing for a safe

13:51.369 --> 13:52.369
excavation

13:52.369 --> 13:57.629
we've got a head and got Jordan Valley

13:57.629 --> 13:59.929
well drillers to come in because there

13:59.929 --> 14:02.850
is an obstruction at about 141 all right

14:02.850 --> 14:04.990
so we're gonna have him kind of swab out

14:04.990 --> 14:07.660
the hole and hopefully get that

14:07.660 --> 14:10.639
obstruction out of the way we feel like

14:10.639 --> 14:12.579
the best opportunity is put the sonar

14:12.579 --> 14:15.339
back in immediately upon Jordan pulling

14:15.339 --> 14:17.410
his tools out I don't know what's your

14:17.410 --> 14:19.019
thought on well we can give it a shot

14:19.019 --> 14:21.879
I'll have to be careful because if you

14:21.879 --> 14:24.569
create this vacuum or you create this

14:24.569 --> 14:27.189
flow of sediment coming in it could trap

14:27.189 --> 14:29.910
the sonar pin it in there what's the

14:29.910 --> 14:39.709
little one cost 35 40

14:39.709 --> 14:41.709
yeah you got some toys up here too yeah

14:41.709 --> 14:43.660
couple three you want to drive some sure

14:43.660 --> 14:48.019
absolutely fun okay let's all cross your

14:48.019 --> 14:51.569
fingers hope it's not plugged yeah all I

14:51.569 --> 14:55.949
can say in 1897 drilling master William

14:55.949 --> 14:58.230
Chappell while working for treasure

14:58.230 --> 15:00.769
hunter Frederick Blair found what they

15:00.769 --> 15:03.550
believed to be a 7-foot tall wooden

15:03.550 --> 15:05.220
vault

15:05.220 --> 15:07.410
since want the team has recently named

15:07.410 --> 15:11.379
the tester vault was discovered 143 feet

15:11.379 --> 15:14.609
below ground well driller Jordan Rogers

15:14.609 --> 15:17.610
has reamed or cleared the area just

15:17.610 --> 15:20.009
above the vault with this drill before

15:20.009 --> 15:23.089
we leave the hall we could go to 180

15:23.089 --> 15:25.000
well let's figure out how much hole we

15:25.000 --> 15:27.649
got here hopefully we got some Jordan

15:27.649 --> 15:29.990
will next drop a measuring cable down

15:29.990 --> 15:32.529
the hole making note of where it lands

15:32.529 --> 15:35.300
this will determine the amount of open

15:35.300 --> 15:38.069
space there is underground

15:38.069 --> 15:40.549
we got five six feet of open hole is

15:40.549 --> 15:42.740
enough to image yeah that's right come

15:42.740 --> 15:43.899
on give me a good number

15:43.899 --> 15:50.109
1:48 Brian you got about seven feet open

15:50.109 --> 15:52.419
hole all right sounds good we got about

15:52.419 --> 15:54.619
seven drops that we can do that good

15:54.619 --> 15:58.410
enough as it is lowered down the hole

15:58.410 --> 16:01.359
the ms1000 takes lateral scans in a

16:01.359 --> 16:04.489
circular pattern making a 3d image of

16:04.489 --> 16:07.309
the space around it I hate to jinx us

16:07.309 --> 16:09.259
but the day's starting off good we'll

16:09.259 --> 16:10.980
get that in the hall let's go

16:10.980 --> 16:11.980
I'm ready to roll

16:11.980 --> 16:20.269
they don't trip

16:20.269 --> 16:27.629
okay let's drop it in you do what

16:27.629 --> 16:29.899
happens let me know when it hits water

16:29.899 --> 16:32.819
at the money pit

16:32.819 --> 16:35.129
underwater visualization expert Brian

16:35.129 --> 16:38.040
Abbott is using a scanning sonar device

16:38.040 --> 16:40.290
to verify the existence of a wooden

16:40.290 --> 16:43.980
treasure vault some 143 feet below the

16:43.980 --> 16:50.999
islands surface water okay keep going

16:50.999 --> 16:52.329
yeah

16:52.329 --> 16:55.980
we want to get the sonar done 145 feet

16:55.980 --> 16:59.389
underground and have it do its work then

16:59.389 --> 17:01.290
come out with clear and concise imagery

17:01.290 --> 17:04.880
that says hey guys Here I am come get me

17:04.880 --> 17:08.060
what do you wanna do now okay

17:08.060 --> 17:15.980
go six inches in okay seeing anything at

17:15.980 --> 17:19.930
all just letting this scan all the way

17:19.930 --> 17:22.440
around and it's not showing me anything

17:22.440 --> 17:25.829
it's like completely kind of closed off

17:25.829 --> 17:32.200
so let's go six inches more okay so

17:32.200 --> 17:36.951
we're roughly at 145 ish what do you got

17:36.951 --> 17:40.440
anything hang on a second

17:40.440 --> 17:49.280
seeing anything at all now 145 issues

17:49.280 --> 17:51.210
where we should be seeing something

17:51.210 --> 17:53.790
that's where the core was yeah six

17:53.790 --> 18:00.850
inches more yeah okay

18:00.850 --> 18:06.290
nothing Brian hang on a second

18:06.290 --> 18:09.280
it's widening out a little bit we may

18:09.280 --> 18:13.350
have gone from foot after two feet oh

18:13.350 --> 18:19.940
you got a bigger void yeah a bigger void

18:19.940 --> 18:22.620
as Brian Abbott found the space he needs

18:22.620 --> 18:24.380
to get an image of the mysterious

18:24.380 --> 18:27.930
underground cavity where are we at one

18:27.930 --> 18:30.640
we're at six and a half feet in so

18:30.640 --> 18:32.740
you're close to tagging bottom yep so

18:32.740 --> 18:34.990
it's just got a you know fine little

18:34.990 --> 18:37.510
cavity going down you saw nothing

18:37.510 --> 18:39.880
angular or not enough all I got is an

18:39.880 --> 18:41.440
outline of something so I think we're

18:41.440 --> 18:43.200
just kind of in a another kind of

18:43.200 --> 18:45.490
straight shaft of unconsolidated

18:45.490 --> 18:48.300
sediment the money pit is the most

18:48.300 --> 18:50.390
difficult to excavate that it's ever

18:50.390 --> 18:52.380
been in the 220 years since it was found

18:52.380 --> 18:55.280
you have 44 shafts so it's probably

18:55.280 --> 18:57.700
voids undergrown because of those very

18:57.700 --> 18:59.790
unstable it's a huge challenge

18:59.790 --> 19:04.620
okay well here's where I'm at I don't I

19:04.620 --> 19:08.630
I don't think this is gonna work yeah I

19:08.630 --> 19:11.890
think we'll pull it yeah slowly bring it

19:11.890 --> 19:12.890
out

19:12.890 --> 19:14.990
although Rick Brian and the team could

19:14.990 --> 19:17.300
not get a clear image of the object in

19:17.300 --> 19:20.200
the money pit they do know based on last

19:20.200 --> 19:22.650
year's discovery that there is something

19:22.650 --> 19:24.990
of interest down there let's clear up

19:24.990 --> 19:26.330
clear up the site

19:26.330 --> 19:28.650
unfortunately the hole that was drilled

19:28.650 --> 19:31.800
last year is simply too narrow and too

19:31.800 --> 19:34.350
impacted with mud and sediment to get a

19:34.350 --> 19:37.410
good reading the only way to be certain

19:37.410 --> 19:40.600
what lies at the bottom is to dig a hole

19:40.600 --> 19:47.310
more than 143 feet straight down

19:47.310 --> 19:51.230
before the Sun sets on Oak Island Rick

19:51.230 --> 19:53.400
lagina is hoping that the day will not

19:53.400 --> 19:56.370
be a total disappointment and to this

19:56.370 --> 19:58.850
end he has invited stone structure

19:58.850 --> 20:02.020
expert and local historian Terry Deveau

20:02.020 --> 20:03.910
to meet him at the Oak Island visitor

20:03.910 --> 20:06.830
center which also is the site of the

20:06.830 --> 20:12.880
islands Museum welcome back my pleasure

20:12.880 --> 20:15.350
rick is hoping that Terry can help

20:15.350 --> 20:18.250
evaluate the large carved stones that he

20:18.250 --> 20:20.730
and the team recently retrieved from the

20:20.730 --> 20:22.720
small house on the other side of the

20:22.720 --> 20:25.690
causeway the ones formerly placed there

20:25.690 --> 20:36.760
by treasure hunter Fred Nolan alright

20:36.760 --> 20:38.610
these are the points of interest if you

20:38.610 --> 20:41.910
will oh I've never seen this oh these

20:41.910 --> 20:44.590
are the actual inscribed stones mr.

20:44.590 --> 20:45.810
Nolan owned it interesting enough to

20:45.810 --> 20:47.780
actually remove it from the island and

20:47.780 --> 20:50.280
to safeguard it he found that important

20:50.280 --> 20:53.570
and I don't know why Terry Mike you take

20:53.570 --> 20:56.310
a look at this you think if this is

20:56.310 --> 20:59.580
natural or is this is man-made

20:59.580 --> 21:02.270
definitely man-made up here what's then

21:02.270 --> 21:06.210
are you look here Terry you see this

21:06.210 --> 21:08.170
there's a straight line yes and then you

21:08.170 --> 21:10.020
have this this semicircle right could

21:10.020 --> 21:13.060
that be the letter D or I think so that

21:13.060 --> 21:15.190
looks like a day to me yeah and that

21:15.190 --> 21:17.620
that hold

21:17.620 --> 21:18.900
looks like it kind of matches the

21:18.900 --> 21:20.740
curvature of this edge doesn't okay

21:20.740 --> 21:23.590
these two pieces seem to be part of the

21:23.590 --> 21:25.930
same stone the two pieces of a puzzle

21:25.930 --> 21:27.720
you could probably match them right up

21:27.720 --> 21:33.000
two pieces of a puzzle pieces that

21:33.000 --> 21:37.290
actually fit together nice like a glove

21:37.290 --> 21:39.271
got a match right there all right so we

21:39.271 --> 21:47.700
have our a d d e and probably an M

21:47.700 --> 21:51.360
could it be an H for heading that would

21:51.360 --> 21:54.950
explain a lot if it was headin could it

21:54.950 --> 21:57.160
be that the carvings on the stones are

21:57.160 --> 21:59.940
referencing Gilbert Hedden the man who

21:59.940 --> 22:02.490
searched for treasure on Oak Island back

22:02.490 --> 22:06.590
in the 1930s it seems like an armed

22:06.590 --> 22:10.140
living anything else did Rick and the

22:10.140 --> 22:13.751
team just discover an important clue one

22:13.751 --> 22:16.730
so important that treasure hunter Fred

22:16.730 --> 22:19.700
Nolan believed he had to hide it and

22:19.700 --> 22:21.690
cement it into the floor of a small

22:21.690 --> 22:25.730
building off the island

22:25.730 --> 22:28.600
we truly appreciate you coming we

22:28.600 --> 22:33.580
learned a little bit but it will keep

22:33.580 --> 22:41.490
looking that's all we can do at the

22:41.490 --> 22:43.720
start of another day of treasure hunting

22:43.720 --> 22:47.070
on Oak Island Rick and Marty lagina have

22:47.070 --> 22:49.380
arranged to meet a man who is offered to

22:49.380 --> 22:52.100
tell them not only what is buried on the

22:52.100 --> 22:55.260
island but who buried it and how to

22:55.260 --> 22:59.310
retrieve it Oh who's here John O'Brien

22:59.310 --> 23:01.170
this is my brother Marty hi Marty how

23:01.170 --> 23:02.870
you doing pleased to meet you sir to

23:02.870 --> 23:03.870
meet you come on

23:03.870 --> 23:05.310
why not I think you're more or less

23:05.310 --> 23:07.140
familiar with this right oh yeah I

23:07.140 --> 23:09.720
pretty well know what's going on all

23:09.720 --> 23:11.930
right yeah here's the thing Jim what we

23:11.930 --> 23:15.410
want to do is find out what's in cavity

23:15.410 --> 23:18.170
at Jan 35 I want to see that post I want

23:18.170 --> 23:19.910
to get a piece of it I want the box

23:19.910 --> 23:22.730
that's a lot of the box yeah let's get

23:22.730 --> 23:26.220
the boxes out nobody does all this work

23:26.220 --> 23:32.291
to hide marbles but you know what my

23:32.291 --> 23:33.850
understanding is you want to show us

23:33.850 --> 23:35.420
some stuff here you want to see some

23:35.420 --> 23:36.810
stuff do we want to take a little tour

23:36.810 --> 23:38.980
what do you want to do now I would like

23:38.980 --> 23:41.610
to go down to the so Shore all right

23:41.610 --> 23:45.660
let's go down there okay

23:45.660 --> 23:48.260
with more than 35 years of experience in

23:48.260 --> 23:50.710
the mining industry author and oak

23:50.710 --> 23:53.970
island historian John O Brien is an

23:53.970 --> 23:56.600
expert at retrieving precious objects

23:56.600 --> 23:59.120
from often impossible to reach locations

23:59.120 --> 24:03.880
he has also been obsessed with solving

24:03.880 --> 24:06.150
the mystery since first hearing about

24:06.150 --> 24:08.630
the island and later visiting it as a

24:08.630 --> 24:12.520
young boy growing up in nearby Halifax I

24:12.520 --> 24:14.120
was just young following when they first

24:14.120 --> 24:16.510
come on the island last week at a

24:16.510 --> 24:18.300
meeting with Rick and members of the

24:18.300 --> 24:21.570
team John O'Brien shared the story of an

24:21.570 --> 24:24.250
amazing discovery his father made while

24:24.250 --> 24:28.030
visiting Oak Island in the early 1960s

24:28.030 --> 24:30.170
my father and one of his best friends

24:30.170 --> 24:32.170
Charlie they were on the UM and they

24:32.170 --> 24:35.550
told me that they had found a rock and

24:35.550 --> 24:39.250
it was shaped like an ice-cream cone

24:39.250 --> 24:42.490
the top was flat they said and the comb

24:42.490 --> 24:45.501
went like that arrow going down what

24:45.501 --> 24:49.260
they did was they uncovered all around

24:49.260 --> 24:52.730
and there was hieroglyphs it was carved

24:52.730 --> 24:57.490
in the rock so then he used latex paint

24:57.490 --> 25:00.470
to get the images that were on the rock

25:00.470 --> 25:02.710
Charlie and dad decided that they would

25:02.710 --> 25:04.870
send these to her University in the

25:04.870 --> 25:07.840
United States to find out what kind of

25:07.840 --> 25:10.680
writing or hieroglyphs it was and I was

25:10.680 --> 25:13.840
there when a box came back and there was

25:13.840 --> 25:16.390
an envelope there and the latex things

25:16.390 --> 25:19.870
were inside and Charles read that these

25:19.870 --> 25:22.380
hieroglyphs that were written on there

25:22.380 --> 25:24.150
came from Central America

25:24.150 --> 25:29.300
a cone-shaped stoned with hieroglyphs

25:29.300 --> 25:32.870
from Central America but before we try

25:32.870 --> 25:35.610
to find out what treasure was here we

25:35.610 --> 25:37.700
have to figure who did the work on Oh

25:37.700 --> 25:40.490
God but I believe that this was the work

25:40.490 --> 25:49.230
done of the Aztec empire
the Aztec

25:49.230 --> 25:51.960
empire hiding treasure on Oak Island

25:51.960 --> 25:55.500
could such a fantastic theory be even

25:55.500 --> 26:00.310
remotely true thriving from 1428 to 1521

26:00.310 --> 26:04.430
the Aztecs are thought to have been a

26:04.430 --> 26:06.820
relatively advanced and culturally

26:06.820 --> 26:10.570
sophisticated civilization their capital

26:10.570 --> 26:12.960
Tenochtitlan was an elaborately

26:12.960 --> 26:15.050
engineered city of pyramid-shaped

26:15.050 --> 26:19.330
temples all decorated with gold as well

26:19.330 --> 26:21.420
as an ingeniously designed water

26:21.420 --> 26:22.420
distribution system

26:22.420 --> 26:28.750
in 1519 the Spanish led by Hernando

26:28.750 --> 26:31.950
Cortez began a ruthless campaign to

26:31.950 --> 26:33.921
destroy the influence of the Aztec

26:33.921 --> 26:37.180
people in the region and thus seal the

26:37.180 --> 26:40.180
fate of the Empire

26:40.180 --> 26:41.780
but what remained a mystery to the

26:41.780 --> 26:44.970
Spanish was the fate of the Aztecs vast

26:44.970 --> 26:48.450
stockpiles of gold and jewels they were

26:48.450 --> 26:50.970
thought to have simply vanished could

26:50.970 --> 26:56.920
they really be on Oak Island

26:56.920 --> 27:00.090
that was the Mayans ship became ashore

27:00.090 --> 27:03.270
and they discovered belogorsk lay in the

27:03.270 --> 27:06.260
sediment to the visas of Americans that

27:06.260 --> 27:09.730
was worth more than ol pal Igor scant

27:09.730 --> 27:13.240
clay otherwise known as blue clay was

27:13.240 --> 27:15.460
widely used by the ancient Mayans to

27:15.460 --> 27:18.530
adorn their temples it is also known to

27:18.530 --> 27:21.860
have medicinal properties although large

27:21.860 --> 27:24.510
deposits appalling Gorsky clay are not

27:24.510 --> 27:27.550
known to exist in mexico it is fairly

27:27.550 --> 27:29.670
common in areas of the southeastern

27:29.670 --> 27:34.470
United States in 2011 researcher Richard

27:34.470 --> 27:36.540
Thornton published his explosive

27:36.540 --> 27:39.110
findings concerning what he believes to

27:39.110 --> 27:41.900
be Mayan ruins in northern Georgia

27:41.900 --> 27:44.270
ruins which are believed to date back

27:44.270 --> 27:48.490
1,100 years hey Rick is

27:48.490 --> 27:54.000
to play during an excavation just a few

27:54.000 --> 27:57.580
weeks ago Rick Marty and Jack Begley

27:57.580 --> 28:00.210
found a large quantity of blue clay

28:00.210 --> 28:02.340
while digging at a spot where researcher

28:02.340 --> 28:04.600
Robert Marcus indicated the treasure

28:04.600 --> 28:06.770
might be found I know that's amazing

28:06.770 --> 28:09.440
stuff could the proof that blue clay can

28:09.440 --> 28:11.960
be found on Oak Island help validate

28:11.960 --> 28:13.190
John O'Brien's theory

28:13.190 --> 28:18.960
the significance of the social shaft was

28:18.960 --> 28:21.570
that was the first shaft put down to

28:21.570 --> 28:23.440
establish a mine here

28:23.440 --> 28:27.430
the Aztecs found the blue clay that they

28:27.430 --> 28:30.270
wanted they knew they could mine that

28:30.270 --> 28:32.250
they probably put a shaft in about eight

28:32.250 --> 28:34.401
foot round and they would have hit

28:34.401 --> 28:38.220
belogorsk I play at 50 feet so just

28:38.220 --> 28:42.100
simple basic mining always 300 feet was

28:42.100 --> 28:44.830
the extent of their ventilation there

28:44.830 --> 28:46.980
would have to be a ventilation shaft

28:46.980 --> 28:48.650
it's probably hidden that's why I

28:48.650 --> 28:50.590
figured there was another shaft up there

28:50.590 --> 28:52.090
and all of a sudden I looked at one it's

28:52.090 --> 28:56.190
the money pit shaft and when the Aztecs

28:56.190 --> 28:58.710
came to hide the treasures they knew

28:58.710 --> 29:00.460
there was an old mine here they

29:00.460 --> 29:02.670
remodeled it and made it into a trap in

29:02.670 --> 29:06.230
fact they made the whole mine into a

29:06.230 --> 29:09.420
trap according to John O'Brien's theory

29:09.420 --> 29:11.800
after the Aztec people buried their

29:11.800 --> 29:13.309
sacred treasures on the island

29:13.309 --> 29:16.490
they remodeled an abandoned Mayan

29:16.490 --> 29:18.940
mineshaft to serve as a lure for

29:18.940 --> 29:22.030
would-be treasure seekers they also

29:22.030 --> 29:24.110
booby-trapped it with flood tunnels to

29:24.110 --> 29:26.000
thwart all who came looking for their

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
treasure

29:27.000 --> 29:30.980
according to Aztec beliefs the souls of

29:30.980 --> 29:33.110
the dead had to pass through nine levels

29:33.110 --> 29:36.240
to obtain eternal rest or their ultimate

29:36.240 --> 29:41.520
reward in 1804 when the money pit was

29:41.520 --> 29:44.860
first excavated to 90 feet nine levels

29:44.860 --> 29:47.080
of oak platforms had been unearthed at

29:47.080 --> 29:49.850
10-foot intervals and in the center of

29:49.850 --> 29:52.750
the ninth platform was an embedded stone

29:52.750 --> 29:55.320
with mysterious carvings that when

29:55.320 --> 29:58.250
removed opened a supposed flood trap

29:58.250 --> 30:00.190
that is defeated every major search

30:00.190 --> 30:02.880
sense

30:02.880 --> 30:04.760
so John is there anything buried here in

30:04.760 --> 30:06.960
this area this general vicinity I don't

30:06.960 --> 30:09.820
believe so I believe that the Aztecs

30:09.820 --> 30:13.150
treasure is not here it's just like a

30:13.150 --> 30:20.990
couple hundred yards over there

30:20.990 --> 30:23.690
while visiting Oak Island mining expert

30:23.690 --> 30:26.970
and author John O'Brien has just made

30:26.970 --> 30:29.110
one of the most amazing claims ever

30:29.110 --> 30:32.670
about the 220 year old mystery method

30:32.670 --> 30:35.290
yes he believes that what is buried on

30:35.290 --> 30:37.250
Oak Island could very well be the

30:37.250 --> 30:40.150
priceless treasures of the Aztec empire

30:40.150 --> 30:43.050
okay what are we doing here this is the

30:43.050 --> 30:46.570
stone at the absolute bottom of Nolan's

30:46.570 --> 30:50.380
cross after leaving the South Shore

30:50.380 --> 30:53.120
O'Brien and the team have arrived at one

30:53.120 --> 30:55.290
of the mysterious cone-shaped boulders

30:55.290 --> 30:57.500
that form a curious megalith the

30:57.500 --> 31:01.520
grouping known as Nolan's cross first

31:01.520 --> 31:03.980
discovered by Oak Island landowner and

31:03.980 --> 31:08.400
treasure hunter Fred Nolan in 1981

31:08.400 --> 31:11.420
although many Oak Island theorists

31:11.420 --> 31:15.320
suggest that the so-called cross can be

31:15.320 --> 31:17.179
linked to everything from the Knights

31:17.179 --> 31:20.100
Templar to the lost works of William

31:20.100 --> 31:23.040
Shakespeare no one has ever been able to

31:23.040 --> 31:26.880
determine its true purpose

31:26.880 --> 31:28.440
would you believe you're standing on a

31:28.440 --> 31:35.250
cliff I believe is you took the topsoil

31:35.250 --> 31:38.190
off here 30 feet down to bedrock but

31:38.190 --> 31:40.320
just like a couple hundred feet over

31:40.320 --> 31:43.860
there the bedrock is a hundred and

31:43.860 --> 31:50.450
eighty feet down when the Aztecs came to

31:50.450 --> 31:53.510
hide the treasures they wanted no sign

31:53.510 --> 31:56.050
of anything going on above they come up

31:56.050 --> 31:58.950
underneath a cliff and they bring all

31:58.950 --> 32:00.980
their goods everything to fill the

32:00.980 --> 32:03.450
chambers then they plug them the

32:03.450 --> 32:07.090
entrance is way down deep meanwhile

32:07.090 --> 32:09.610
there's no evidence anything going on so

32:09.610 --> 32:13.200
that the top would look understood

32:13.200 --> 32:15.380
according to John O'Brien's theory the

32:15.380 --> 32:17.600
Aztecs who were skilled at building

32:17.600 --> 32:20.840
canals and waterways came to Oak Island

32:20.840 --> 32:25.400
sometime in the early 16th century here

32:25.400 --> 32:27.220
Aztec engineers built dams and

32:27.220 --> 32:30.260
artificial beaches on both sides of what

32:30.260 --> 32:34.000
were once two separate islands they then

32:34.000 --> 32:37.390
dug shafts into cliff faces horizontally

32:37.390 --> 32:39.300
and then refilled the dammed area with

32:39.300 --> 32:44.590
rocks and mud creating

32:44.590 --> 32:46.360
O'Brien's research has also led him to

32:46.360 --> 32:49.000
believe that the huge megalithic

32:49.000 --> 32:51.850
boulders which form Nolan's cross could

32:51.850 --> 32:54.490
provide the key to finding out where the

32:54.490 --> 32:56.920
Aztec treasure chambers still remain

32:56.920 --> 33:00.059
hidden

33:00.059 --> 33:03.660
they planned on coming back to retrieve

33:03.660 --> 33:06.690
it I don't think that they would have

33:06.690 --> 33:09.760
gone in that lagoon and dig down there

33:09.760 --> 33:11.980
to retrieve it all they have to do was

33:11.980 --> 33:15.710
come here and find this cross why the

33:15.710 --> 33:18.610
shape of a cross John why was that

33:18.610 --> 33:21.370
important to that every ancient

33:21.370 --> 33:25.020
civilization of the world had the cross

33:25.020 --> 33:28.610
but to the Aztec Mayan the cross was

33:28.610 --> 33:32.800
rejuvenation and revival it it was like

33:32.800 --> 33:35.460
a tree growing up and the cross beams

33:35.460 --> 33:38.230
were the branches where civilization was

33:38.230 --> 33:41.050
going to be destroyed they knew that but

33:41.050 --> 33:44.290
the plan there would be a revival that

33:44.290 --> 33:46.790
their civilization would rise again and

33:46.790 --> 33:49.870
where would you put the treasures that

33:49.870 --> 33:52.100
you wanted to keep that were history you

33:52.100 --> 33:54.990
would put them at the roots this is the

33:54.990 --> 33:58.440
root of the cross right here according

33:58.440 --> 34:00.960
to the Mesoamerican culture the world

34:00.960 --> 34:03.870
was represented by a world tree with the

34:03.870 --> 34:06.110
heavens above it and the underworld

34:06.110 --> 34:10.099
below - the Aztecs the tree symbolized

34:10.099 --> 34:13.309
both life and death with the arms and

34:13.309 --> 34:15.469
trunk of the tree symbolizing the

34:15.469 --> 34:19.699
cardinal directions and their deities

34:19.699 --> 34:23.549
four of the rocks of the cross are on

34:23.549 --> 34:26.668
the east side of the island only two

34:26.668 --> 34:30.020
were on the west side the key rocks are

34:30.020 --> 34:33.010
on this side and they knew that's the

34:33.010 --> 34:35.869
spot they would dig and it's exactly

34:35.869 --> 34:38.799
between that rock and the next rock over

34:38.799 --> 34:42.730
there 147 feet between them

34:42.730 --> 34:45.248
that's a ritual measurement of the

34:45.248 --> 34:47.299
Aztecs and I bet you that's where they

34:47.299 --> 34:53.530
hit it it's exact on this cross in 1986

34:53.530 --> 34:55.379
archaeologists discovered that the

34:55.379 --> 34:59.749
number 147 was significant in the ritual

34:59.749 --> 35:02.769
architecture of both the Mayans and the

35:02.769 --> 35:05.760
Aztecs according to John O Brien the

35:05.760 --> 35:07.960
halfway mark between the bottom two

35:07.960 --> 35:12.769
boulders of Nolan's cross is exactly 147

35:12.769 --> 35:16.390
feet you're saying the place to dig if

35:16.390 --> 35:18.380
you were in charge of this here

35:18.380 --> 35:21.000
expedition is halfway between this rock

35:21.000 --> 35:24.190
and the next one on the cross yes right

35:24.190 --> 35:27.809
in the middle of 147 each way below that

35:27.809 --> 35:30.839
and below the bedrock are the chambers

35:30.839 --> 35:34.799
where the real treasures hid no no

35:34.799 --> 35:36.240
okay John what are we gonna find when we

35:36.240 --> 35:38.680
drill these holes I believe there's two

35:38.680 --> 35:42.940
chambers there one is the historical

35:42.940 --> 35:46.420
religious artifacts of an empire a 16

35:46.420 --> 35:48.820
million people and in the other is the

35:48.820 --> 35:53.160
tomb of the god King Montezuma and it's

35:53.160 --> 35:56.400
sitting there it's been sitting there

35:56.400 --> 36:00.411
since about 1521 I'll bet my hat on it I

36:00.411 --> 36:06.880
won't need we have a plethora of wild

36:06.880 --> 36:09.579
theories out here now to add to that

36:09.579 --> 36:11.450
we've got the treasure of the Aztecs

36:11.450 --> 36:16.589
well okay that seems a stretch to me but

36:16.589 --> 36:18.560
what if he's right my goodness what if

36:18.560 --> 36:19.769
he's right

36:19.769 --> 36:22.499
but even if John O'Brien's incredible

36:22.499 --> 36:25.930
theory is true proving it will still

36:25.930 --> 36:28.930
remain a considerable challenge for Rick

36:28.930 --> 36:31.570
Marty and their partners because the

36:31.570 --> 36:34.309
marked location of the treasure cache is

36:34.309 --> 36:37.799
not on their land but on land owned by

36:37.799 --> 36:40.680
the man who discovered Nolan's cross

36:40.680 --> 36:43.779
Fred Nolan so you're indicating to us

36:43.779 --> 36:46.640
that further search regarding your

36:46.640 --> 36:48.690
theory would have to of necessity

36:48.690 --> 36:52.490
operate on Fred's property so in order

36:52.490 --> 36:55.140
for this to work we'd have to reach out

36:55.140 --> 36:56.210
to mr. Nolan

36:56.210 --> 36:58.029
mr. Nolan would have to agree to work

36:58.029 --> 37:00.980
with us and agree to work with you in

37:00.980 --> 37:02.920
terms of the development or the

37:02.920 --> 37:05.240
exploration of your theory right yeah I

37:05.240 --> 37:07.430
know what a land mine that is right yes

37:07.430 --> 37:10.980
I know all about it although most of the

37:10.980 --> 37:14.210
140 acres of Oak Island is either owned

37:14.210 --> 37:16.290
or controlled by the laginas and their

37:16.290 --> 37:19.630
partners 20 acres are owned privately

37:19.630 --> 37:23.320
and 16 of those are owned by Fred Nolan

37:23.320 --> 37:27.060
a man who has so far been reluctant to

37:27.060 --> 37:30.999
collaborate with them so John look thank

37:30.999 --> 37:32.589
you very much for coming on the island

37:32.589 --> 37:34.660
it's intriguing like a lot of things are

37:34.660 --> 37:37.609
out here let us kick it around and we

37:37.609 --> 37:38.999
will certainly get back with you and see

37:38.999 --> 37:40.849
what the consensus is so I want to thank

37:40.849 --> 37:42.779
you one of the interesting things about

37:42.779 --> 37:44.609
John O'Brien's theory was simply this he

37:44.609 --> 37:46.650
put an X on the spot

37:46.650 --> 37:48.940
the unfortunate thing is the X's on mr.

37:48.940 --> 37:51.440
Nolan's property now could we reach some

37:51.440 --> 37:54.910
sort of agreement perhaps but as of

37:54.910 --> 37:57.030
right now we cannot proceed with John's

37:57.030 --> 37:59.170
theory we got to talk to dad and see if

37:59.170 --> 38:01.690
we can get Fred on board too yes yes

38:01.690 --> 38:02.690
that would be great

38:02.690 --> 38:03.690
Cheers thanks a lot

38:03.690 --> 38:20.960
okay guys we I think have reached the

38:20.960 --> 38:22.690
point where we gotta take a deep breath

38:22.690 --> 38:24.619
and figure out what the hell would

38:24.619 --> 38:27.819
decide exactly what we're gonna do right

38:27.819 --> 38:29.990
after an exciting week that has brought

38:29.990 --> 38:33.059
not only new clues but an incredible new

38:33.059 --> 38:36.200
theory Rick and Marty lagina have

38:36.200 --> 38:37.960
gathered with their partners in the warm

38:37.960 --> 38:40.869
room for an important meeting we need to

38:40.869 --> 38:50.079
deal with
just as dan Blankenship has

38:50.079 --> 38:52.950
spent the past 50 years trying to solve

38:52.950 --> 38:56.319
the Oak Island mystery Fred Nolan has

38:56.319 --> 38:58.660
been working toward the same goal for an

38:58.660 --> 39:02.609
even greater amount of time for a while

39:02.609 --> 39:04.599
the two men even worked together as

39:04.599 --> 39:07.650
partners until a series of professional

39:07.650 --> 39:10.769
disagreements grew into a bitter rivalry

39:10.769 --> 39:13.220
that has lasted to this day what was

39:13.220 --> 39:17.079
going on in this island was a feud in my

39:17.079 --> 39:19.630
opinion it's about as strong as any

39:19.630 --> 39:22.440
you've ever heard about although Dan and

39:22.440 --> 39:25.180
his former partner David Tobias and

39:25.180 --> 39:28.180
later Rick and Marty lagina along with

39:28.180 --> 39:30.370
Craig tester controlled most of Oak

39:30.370 --> 39:33.000
Island including the money pit area and

39:33.000 --> 39:36.489
Smith's Cove Fred Nolan controls much of

39:36.489 --> 39:39.869
the mysterious triangle-shaped swamp he

39:39.869 --> 39:43.470
also owns the area were in 1981 he

39:43.470 --> 39:45.410
discovered a number of large megalithic

39:45.410 --> 39:48.150
boulders boulders which when viewed from

39:48.150 --> 39:50.730
the air formed the shape of an enormous

39:50.730 --> 39:54.420
cross you're not going to forgive and

39:54.420 --> 39:55.420
forget

39:55.420 --> 39:58.119
40 years of

39:58.119 --> 40:03.799
very contentious issues and it's left

40:03.799 --> 40:07.059
its wounds we can't do anything unless

40:07.059 --> 40:08.819
we have a real deal with the new ones

40:08.819 --> 40:11.869
and rig has done a great job of calming

40:11.869 --> 40:16.420
down the tensions here friends got a lot

40:16.420 --> 40:17.880
of information on the swamp

40:17.880 --> 40:19.901
he's probed it for years and years and I

40:19.901 --> 40:21.740
think it's a lot of information let's go

40:21.740 --> 40:23.549
get a deal with them we've made a

40:23.549 --> 40:27.410
working relationship offer ie we fund

40:27.410 --> 40:30.380
several drill sites he put sex on the

40:30.380 --> 40:33.190
spot and within that framework of that

40:33.190 --> 40:35.359
that proposal I think we can add the

40:35.359 --> 40:37.390
swamp extension agreement and then

40:37.390 --> 40:39.460
thoughts that works for everybody okay

40:39.460 --> 40:43.700
okay Rick go get it are we done here

40:43.700 --> 40:48.390
then yeah all right yay let's pool this

40:48.390 --> 40:50.940
meeting up and go do something

40:50.940 --> 40:53.940
well ending the feud also lead to a new

40:53.940 --> 40:57.349
beginning a cooperative partnership that

40:57.349 --> 41:00.670
could reveal important information and

41:00.670 --> 41:02.900
even more exciting discoveries

41:02.900 --> 41:07.799
or could the wounds inflicted on the two

41:07.799 --> 41:11.769
men simply be too deep and too infected

41:11.769 --> 41:12.769
by mistrust

41:12.769 --> 41:16.880
to ever have a chance to heal perhaps

41:16.880 --> 41:20.069
the answer lies buried somewhere on Oak

41:20.069 --> 41:23.339
Island and deep beneath a patch of

41:23.339 --> 41:29.739
ground that is yet to be explored next

41:29.739 --> 41:32.500
time on the curse of Oak Island deal

41:32.500 --> 41:34.289
with Nolan how does that strike you with

41:34.289 --> 41:36.900
mixed emotions it's time to quit the

41:36.900 --> 41:38.619
fighting I don't want to be an obstacle

41:38.619 --> 41:40.940
anymore welcome to the team

41:40.940 --> 41:44.880
ready to put it in the ground Fred right

41:44.880 --> 41:49.529
on your squat looks like to man baby

41:49.529 --> 41:51.210
there's a cavity in this slate that

41:51.210 --> 41:52.680
would be the most important discovery on

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
Oh God

41:55.980 --> 41:57.129
that's actually metal
