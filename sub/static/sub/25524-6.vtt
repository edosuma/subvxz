WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.976
I want to know how the best
bawd in London

00:03.000 --> 00:04.320
snags a virgin.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.240
Secure me a pretty maid
and be sure to test her

00:07.320 --> 00:08.720
about her virtue.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.640
I want you to go to Justice Hunt

00:10.720 --> 00:12.320
and to tell him that
Margaret Wells

00:12.400 --> 00:15.800
is forcing girls
to work against their will.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.760
I can't marry him.
You will marry him!

00:17.800 --> 00:19.960
There's a little Quiggy
growing inside me.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.480
I'm a Spartan too.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.520
You've killed. With one stab.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.000
Charlotte sent me.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.640
And what does Charlotte
want us to do?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.120
We need to buy a virgin.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.200
What are you doing?
This man is a liar

00:32.280 --> 00:33.640
and a thief, put him out.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.960
Get off me.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.880
Unsullied virgin
or deceitful whore.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.720
On this occasion, you lose.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.400
Lydia.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.040
Lydia, let me out!

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

02:22.560 --> 02:24.800
Will?

02:24.840 --> 02:27.280
Something isn't right.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.160
It's been too long.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.840
You'll know soon enough.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.440
Open the door!

02:41.960 --> 02:42.800
What happened?

02:42.840 --> 02:43.840
Where's Charlotte?

02:43.880 --> 02:45.560
I was beaten, we've failed.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.960
The lady will
conclude you upstairs, sir.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.120
The bastards broke
my sparring arm.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.280
No, no, no, no, no.
Your shoulder's out.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.680
No, don't come near it.
What are you doing?

03:05.280 --> 03:07.840
Villain!

03:07.960 --> 03:09.160
What happened?

03:09.280 --> 03:11.440
When I asked to take
the girl out the house,

03:11.560 --> 03:14.000
the pretense fell.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.000
I was held and beaten
by a pack of wankhanded fops.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.280
And what of Charlotte?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.800
Last I saw, she was
spinning lies into gold.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.840
And the kidnapped girl?

03:26.880 --> 03:28.400
What's happened to him?

03:28.440 --> 03:30.000
We should have told the law!

03:30.120 --> 03:32.280
The law's as useless
as paps on a man!

03:46.000 --> 03:48.960
Go and tell Nancy, Fan.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.880
I expect to be informed every
time she so much as coughs,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.120
and you have let her
leave my house!

03:55.160 --> 03:59.160
You lumpen, feebleminded dolts!

04:06.280 --> 04:07.560
When you marry,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.280
Amelia will be
your unpaid housekeeper,

04:10.360 --> 04:13.000
so you won't need me.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.216
So I'd like to suggest that

04:14.240 --> 04:17.360
This is about Mrs. Scanwell.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.920
It's calumny.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.279
It says she was once

04:20.360 --> 04:25.120
a depraved and wanton harlot.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.240
Poor Mrs. Scanwell.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.040
She'll be glad
of her blindness today.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.560
ls there substance in this?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.336
What does it matter if
she once played the strumpet

04:34.360 --> 04:35.120
for her bread?

04:35.160 --> 04:36.920
Of course it matters!

04:37.000 --> 04:38.920
Who did this to her?

04:39.040 --> 04:41.160
Whom has she offended?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.240
That's the right question.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.920
Pay me to be your eyes and ears

04:45.040 --> 04:46.600
and I'll help you find out.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.480
Holy God,

04:56.560 --> 04:59.360
thank you for this bread.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.840
Thank you for my daughter

05:01.920 --> 05:05.720
who lights my path.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.240
Let her not flounder.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.680
Show her her duty.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.600
Let her know righteous love.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.160
Will I read you the paper,
Mrs. Scanwell?

05:18.240 --> 05:21.800
Seems you should know
quite a bit of love yourself.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.560
"Covent Garden, London.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.160
Mrs. Scandal,
or The Perverted Converted."

05:29.240 --> 05:31.800
"Londoners may have noticed
a blackclad figure

05:31.840 --> 05:34.480
outside Litreal Street
magistrates' court."

05:37.240 --> 05:39.560
That girl will be
grateful to you

05:39.600 --> 05:41.400
for the rest of her life.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.720
What a superb entrance
to the profession.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.480
When you come next time,
I'll have her kiss your feet.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.720
Perhaps not my feet.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.360
Ã€ bientÃ´t, Mrs. Quigley.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.360
Goodbye, your lordship.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.560
Charlotte. Charlotte!

06:07.600 --> 06:08.400
Shush, shush, shush!

06:08.480 --> 06:10.920
Shush, stop that noise!

06:11.040 --> 06:12.360
Your sister is indisposed.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.720
Go home to your kennel
on Greek Street.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.840
Must I tell Lord Fallon
that you barred me?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.040
He's my keeper now.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
Sit.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.680
Assure your sister
that all is well...

06:36.720 --> 06:39.480
or the girl you stole
will find a short future

06:39.560 --> 06:43.120
with the foulest pimp
on Cheapside.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.680
Lucy.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.360
I've had a drink too many.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.040
My head is quite stricken.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.600
Mine too.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.040
My new keeper is intoxicating.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.840
Lord Fallon.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.240
He's a big fish for you,
little minnow.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.600
Here I am between
two blossoming branches

07:12.720 --> 07:14.800
of the Wells tree.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.360
May I talk to my sister alone?

07:19.400 --> 07:22.000
How do you like Lord Fallon?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.280
Very well.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.800
But I need your advice.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.120
Not this morning.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.240
My head's full
of dandelion clocks.

07:35.360 --> 07:40.360
You should talk to Ma,
as you always do.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.600
You left without telling me.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.896
What on Earth possessed you
to come on foot?

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
You could have had my carriage.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.280
I didn't like to wake you.

07:50.360 --> 07:54.160
I'm at your service
every hour of the day.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.800
I wanted to see Charlotte.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.240
Miss Wells, a delight, always.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.160
Lucy was telling me
of her happy fortune.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.840
I find myself bereft
without her.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.920
Come and see me.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.720
I will.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.280
The man with your sister.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.840
I saw him with a bloody knife
in his hand

08:26.920 --> 08:28.376
the night Justice Cunliffe
was killed.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.720
Lord Fallon? He did it.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.880
And he was excited
when he done the deed.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.640
I saw it with my own eyes.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.480
Go to Greek Street,
tell my mother.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.840
He played my eunuch.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.360
We deflowered a vestal
last night.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.440
You and your friends
would have relished it.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.480
Mrs. Quigley!

09:04.520 --> 09:05.720
The molly boy.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.080
What of him?

09:07.120 --> 09:11.080
I heard him conspire
with Charlotte.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.600
About what? Out with it!

09:12.720 --> 09:15.720
He slandered Lord Fallon.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.200
How?

09:17.240 --> 09:20.000
He accused you of killing
Justice Cunliffe.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.240
What an absurd mistake!

09:22.360 --> 09:24.120
Charlotte has sent him
to her mother

09:24.200 --> 09:25.360
in Greek Street.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.360
He's a turncoat,
perilous to us both.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.960
Finish him.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.840
I need to meet with my banker.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.760
I'll follow you, my love.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.120
Take her home.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.000
Let's leave.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.240
Let's run away.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.480
Why do you laugh?
I'm in earnest.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.360
I won't leave.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.840
I'm working to gain
my freedom and a wage.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.080
Yes, but we have to be
true to ourselves.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.480
Even if it means penury.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.360
I am true to myself.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.760
I shouldn't have
dallied with you.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.600
I've spoilt your peace.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.720
ls that what I am?

10:33.760 --> 10:36.080
A dalliance?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.600
Then I'll marry the justice
and be damned a liar.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.480
Amelia.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.720
Doubt he'll have you now.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.416
Rasselas.
Come this way quickly.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.760
No, I must get to my mother.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.440
She's been viciously abused.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.600
Peter!

12:12.840 --> 12:14.600
She all right?
She's not breathing!

12:14.640 --> 12:16.520
Get some help!

12:27.840 --> 12:30.840
Rapists triumph,
murderers go free

12:30.880 --> 12:32.320
while you merrily come wooing.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.840
I want to speak
to Mrs. Scanwell.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.840
Justice, I know
what you must think.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.120
My daughter has not
been tainted by my sins.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.840
You withheld the truth from me.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.120
That is a deception.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.440
Amelia has not deceived you.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.600
 I am a justice of the peace.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.320
My reputation must be
unimpeachable.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.640
Quigley was forcing me
to confound Mrs. Wells

12:48.720 --> 12:49.960
and I wouldn't.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.240
She has me enmeshed
in the snare of my past

12:52.360 --> 12:54.240
but I defied her.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.600
What past?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.480
I told her to do her worst.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.600
She's an old trollop,
God love her.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.120
Think what you will of me,

13:02.240 --> 13:04.840
but my daughter's heart
is true and it's pure

13:04.880 --> 13:06.120
and she has given it to you.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.600
Mags!

13:07.640 --> 13:09.480
Mags!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.480
There's been a stabbing.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.840
Come quick.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.600
Come, Amelia. Gently.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.960
We found her in the street.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.640
She's bleeding hard.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.480
No, my darling, don't die.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.520
Come on.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.880
Help's coming,
don't you dare die.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.336
The justice is here,
he'll help us.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.000
Come on, Amelia.

13:47.600 --> 13:52.360
Clear the parlor
and get blankets.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.840
Nance, tell her mother.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.080
Your girl, she's been injured.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.720
A knife, some sharp object.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.720
Amelia.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.360
She lives.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.960
Who did this?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.480
We don't know, I'm sorry.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.200
Not even she, not even Quigley.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.480
No, no.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.120
God, don't take my child.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.120
Come now, come now, come now.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.120
She needs your strength,
not your woe.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.240
Come on.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.600
Girls, the table, move it.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.080
Lay her in front of the fire.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.600
Fetch water and we need
to build up the fire.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.096
There's a servant
at the judge's house,

14:36.120 --> 14:37.480
Violet Cross, bring her.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.120
You go for a surgeon.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.720
Darling.

14:44.760 --> 14:45.840
My darling.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.240
God is good.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.320
God is good
and He loves you well.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.600
Don't leave, don't leave.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.480
I'm dressing.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.480
Yes, I can see that.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.240
Your amethysts would
go well with that.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.000
Leave us.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.880
I won them in a bidding war.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.720
Along with first use
of a virgin.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.080
What have you done?

15:51.120 --> 15:52.360
Where is Charlotte?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.520
I don't think Charlotte
was her name.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.696
Not that I listened to the girl,

15:55.720 --> 15:57.120
she was blubbing tediously.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.360
Almost distracted me
from her unspoiled flesh.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.200
How could you?
Because I wanted to discover

16:03.240 --> 16:06.000
why my irrational sister

16:06.080 --> 16:10.520
was conspiring
with blacks and harlots.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.880
Why would you plot destruction

16:12.000 --> 16:13.480
upon a retch like Mrs. Quigley?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.480
Because she is a beast
and so are you!

16:15.520 --> 16:19.200
Quigley's done you
personal wrong, hasn't she?

16:19.240 --> 16:22.840
And as I lay
on my costly virgin,

16:22.880 --> 16:27.120
I fell to wondering
what that wrong could be.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.240
Fuck!

16:37.960 --> 16:42.960
It's been too many moons
since I broke a girl.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.080
None of them...

16:49.120 --> 16:52.720
none of them
could hold a candle to you.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.720
You remain the most perfect
act of my whole life.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.240
She blackmails you,
doesn't she??

17:11.280 --> 17:15.200
Did something happen
in the years that I was away?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.160
Tell me. I can help you.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.200
Get your damn hands off me.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.040
I will leave you forever.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.720
How?

17:35.800 --> 17:38.000
Where would you go?

17:38.040 --> 17:41.640
You prove
your incapacity every day.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.040
Your treachery
is hurting like a knife.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.160
I could not bare that girl
being raped.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Tried what I could
to prevent it.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.280
So rather than say,

18:15.400 --> 18:18.280
"I disapprove" or...

18:18.400 --> 18:20.720
"Must you tread this path?"

18:20.800 --> 18:22.040
you sought to ambush me?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.000
I sought to rescue her.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.240
With your muse, Lady Fitz?

18:27.320 --> 18:28.760
lt was not her doing.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.000
Fancy you, falling for the
tricks of a spoilt grandee.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.200
Your final lesson
in being a bawd.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.320
Own what you have done.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.480
I want her ready for tonight.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.720
Where's my brave sausage today?

19:19.800 --> 19:22.000
He's all upset.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.480
You and my mother.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.440
This animosity will stop.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.480
I need my sausage.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.760
No arguing.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.240
Charles...

19:42.280 --> 19:43.320
we need you on the door.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.480
I'm busy caring for Emily.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.520
She's in a delicate state

19:48.640 --> 19:51.520
with Quigley minor.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.480
And I can tell you
he's going to be

19:53.560 --> 19:55.800
a feisty little chap.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.240
Congratulations.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.680
Why did you tell her?

20:04.720 --> 20:07.720
It should be our secret.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.480
Mr. Sausage wants
the whole world to know.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.040
God help me.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.000
Don't tell me,
he's got work to do in there.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.480
I like Emily,
but she's a lazy jade

20:25.520 --> 20:27.520
and he's about as useful
as a cushion.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.480
There'll soon be
another mouth to feed.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.200
No!

20:31.240 --> 20:32.800
Charles Quigley's got seed?

20:32.920 --> 20:35.240
lf it's his.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.080
lf this was truly
a house of exotics,

20:37.200 --> 20:39.480
we'd have a black bawd.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.000
Should be you.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.456
ls there a business
in this whole town

20:43.480 --> 20:45.560
run by women of our color?

20:45.680 --> 20:47.240
We could do it.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.520
What's he doing?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.720
He must sear the wound,
stop the blood.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.720
Violet Cross, you've spun
your glamour around my child.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.560
You keep back!

21:24.280 --> 21:28.000
She's done this
many times before...

21:28.040 --> 21:30.440
to girls as young as ten.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.200
My mother was one of them.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.760
I wanted to avenge her.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.240
It blinded me.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.240
She will pay for
what she's done.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.520
And he will too...

21:51.640 --> 21:54.160
the beast that raped you.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.720
And what of you?

21:58.760 --> 22:00.080
How will you pay?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.720
You decide.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.160
You...

22:08.240 --> 22:10.640
you've taken my family from me.

22:13.160 --> 22:17.240
I will never let them see
what I have become.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.640
I want you to lose
your family too

22:24.720 --> 22:27.720
so you can pay with my curse.

22:29.160 --> 22:33.280
Not on my family,
they've not harmed you.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.520
Nor had mine harmed you.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.320
You have killed their child.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.280
My men are out there now
looking for witnesses.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.240
Whatever her mother may be,
Amelia is blameless.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.080
From where I'm standing,
all girls are blameless.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.720
Even those with used cunnies.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.680
Like poor Kitty Carter.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.480
lt goes badly.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.200
They're starting to pray.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.680
Ma?

23:09.720 --> 23:12.000
You're wanted.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.960
Go home and wait for me.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.320
How is Miss Scanwell? Alive.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.440
The devil's own smile
across her belly.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.960
lt was meant for me.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.040
I recognized the man
who killed Justice Cunliffe.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.320
He was at Quigley's.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.960
He came after me.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.880
Miss Scanwell got between us.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.280
So that is it. I must run.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.176
A rich man like that
will search until I'm dead.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.720
No, no.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.440
Give me the bastard's name.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.320
Lord Fallon.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.480
You lie.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.960
Upon my life, Lord Fallon.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.640
Lucy.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.760
What troubles you?

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
Why did you leave?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.160
Last night...

24:06.240 --> 24:07.480
I fear the Charis made me speak

24:07.560 --> 24:11.000
of some strange inventions.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.760
Don't tell anyone what I said.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.320
It was the stuff
of smokewreaths.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.000
You are more remarkable
every day.

24:23.080 --> 24:27.800
You deserve to be here,
elevated, by my side.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.480
Queen of your realm.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.240
London is a charnel house.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.800
I have a sudden desire
to see you under a brighter sun.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.280
Travel with me.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.080
Where?
To the temples of Greece.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.800
Will we lay among the ruins

24:47.920 --> 24:49.880
on the bones of the dead?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.040
You have to make
an appointment.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.560
Madam! Let me see him!

25:00.680 --> 25:01.720
Madam!

25:01.800 --> 25:03.000
Lucy!

25:04.720 --> 25:05.960
Damn you, Ma.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.320
Get out!

25:07.440 --> 25:09.280
Come away from him, my love.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.000
Charlotte needs you, not I.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.200
Let me talk to you alone
for a moment.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.800
This is Fallon's house.

25:17.920 --> 25:22.640
We have no secrets.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
Mrs. Scanwell's daughter

25:24.760 --> 25:27.000
was found stabbed
and dying in the street

25:27.080 --> 25:28.720
not this halfhour past.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.760
He did it.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.560
That's absurd.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.560
It cannot be so.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.200
You insult me most bizarrely.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.000
She's lying
at Greek Street now,

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
halfway between this world
and the next.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.720
Why would he do such a thing?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.800
She was in his way,
so he slashed her down.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.480
I'm sorry to hear it, Ma,

25:53.560 --> 25:56.080
but what you speak of
is madness.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.720
lt's not his first slaughter.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.320
He stuck Justice Cunliffe

25:59.440 --> 26:01.000
and he was witnessed in the act.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.440
The corrupt judge
who would have hanged my sister?

26:03.480 --> 26:06.720
I cannot say it any clearer,
this man is a killer!

26:11.400 --> 26:13.040
So am I.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.160
What have you told him?

26:21.240 --> 26:24.280
Lucy and I
are in perfect harmony.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.520
What you did, my love...

26:29.640 --> 26:32.200
was in defense
of your own person.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.320
You know the blame
does not rest at your door.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.080
This man is cold murder.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.880
Forgive me,

26:41.960 --> 26:44.040
but I can no longer
have her in my house.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.480
Then put her out.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.240
Let us understand
each other, Ma.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.880
Say nothing to
the hirelings of the law

27:21.960 --> 27:24.280
or I'll tell them
that sweet Lucy

27:24.400 --> 27:26.760
killed my friend Sir George.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.720
My silence will not save you.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.520
Miss Scanwell may survive.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.240
She knows your powdered face.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.680
Wounds fester...

27:40.720 --> 27:42.960
and she's like to die.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.720
It would be better
for your Lucy if she did.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.800
Be silent...

27:53.920 --> 27:56.000
or your lovely daughter hangs.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.000
Yeah!

28:35.800 --> 28:39.040
Look, cherries
from your Cherry.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.560
You're too sumptuous.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.720
I love them.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.000
Yeah!

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I need to talk to Charles.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.040
Out.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.520
Emily!

28:52.640 --> 28:54.000
Be nice.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.480
Stay away from him.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.400
I'll throw you in a poxy sack.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.000
Lord Fallon's puffed her up

29:07.040 --> 29:08.480
with his highwrought lies.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.480
They're running through her
like a spell.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.080
We must get her out.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.560
She won't come for her ma.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.240
She follows you like
a little lamb, Nance.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.680
And her pa too.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.800
Coax her.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.400
What will you do?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.480
Tend the sick.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.920
No you won't.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.016
You're gonna have a fight
with Quigley

29:39.040 --> 29:40.240
around the Golden Square.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.216
There's not a single inch of me

29:44.240 --> 29:46.440
that you don't know.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.880
Make sure you get her, Nance.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.800
lt's done.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.720
She's in a whore's raiment.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.960
Has it all been a lie?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.240
Every hour you've been
in my house?

30:57.400 --> 31:00.440
You are so impressive.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.280
You're fearless and clever

31:03.400 --> 31:06.640
and you made me feel the same.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.760
I was yours...

31:08.880 --> 31:12.320
until your auction for rape.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.800
Why must you pander
to the basest of desires?

31:14.920 --> 31:16.240
I pander to men.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.720
I give them what they want.

31:17.800 --> 31:22.080
Until yesterday,
I wanted you to be my mother.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.240
You think I've been
a monster to that girl...

31:29.280 --> 31:32.000
but every word I said
to her is true.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.000
I'm giving her a better life.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.280
The shock of entering
she'll soon forget.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.480
What was your shock?

31:39.560 --> 31:43.680
Some hairy stranger
in the dark, like mine?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.800
Or was it somebody you knew?

31:47.640 --> 31:52.000
I thank him every day

31:52.040 --> 31:54.200
for the knowledge
that he gave me.

31:56.720 --> 32:01.320
He taught me that love
is strongest when it's cruel.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.720
He gave me fortitude.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.520
I've given that legacy
to all my girls.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.240
It's the lesson
I was teaching you.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.680
Does it ease your pain...

32:17.720 --> 32:19.160
inflicting it upon others?

32:22.320 --> 32:25.480
I will be your daughter,

32:25.560 --> 32:27.920
but this must stop.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.320
This is not the way
to be a bawd.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.720
What other way is there?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.480
Let the girl go free.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.480
The dwarf is here.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.080
Make it wait.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.680
She says she's been
blown on a breeze

32:48.720 --> 32:52.000
of plots and treachery.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.720
What brings you?

33:07.760 --> 33:10.720
Miss Lacey weaves her web
around your son

33:10.760 --> 33:13.920
and she's not the only spider.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.200
Margaret Wells,

33:24.240 --> 33:27.480
a rich woman
with a cloudhigh wig,

33:27.560 --> 33:30.160
and your courtesan, Charlotte,

33:30.240 --> 33:32.320
they all conspire against you.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.520
Charlotte?

33:37.640 --> 33:41.240
She is the glue
that brings them all together.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.200
My daughter until yesterday?

33:48.240 --> 33:49.760
Cursed liar!

33:54.160 --> 33:56.080
Do you feel wronged?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.440
Have I wronged you, Lydia?
Have I lied?

33:58.480 --> 33:59.960
Well, here's the truth.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.480
You stink of rape and death

34:03.560 --> 34:06.880
and I hate... I hate you!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.016
Get the girl from upstairs
and bring her down

34:10.040 --> 34:13.840
or I swear I will choke this
farroweating sow to death.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.880
Shut up, you!

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
Charlotte!

34:22.120 --> 34:23.520
No, no!

34:23.600 --> 34:25.880
No! Do not sully yourself!

34:32.120 --> 34:36.000
I will not see my hate
drift past onto my child.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.760
I'm taking her home.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.440
And if you try to stop us,

34:54.480 --> 34:57.480
either you or me will die.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.480
Ma...

35:02.560 --> 35:05.480
the girl,
we cannot leave her behind.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.200
There's nothing you can do.

35:07.320 --> 35:10.080
Your daughter.

35:10.160 --> 35:14.040
I've made her just like me.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.320
She's now a Quigley to the core.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.200
Never.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.040
I came here thinking
I would kill her

35:29.120 --> 35:31.160
and then I saw you.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.600
Why'd you stop me?

35:33.680 --> 35:37.280
I would not have that
on your soul!

35:37.360 --> 35:39.920
She bought you
for a poxy pair of shoes.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.680
That was all you're worth.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.160
I curse myself for telling you.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.080
It was selfish to speak of it.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.400
She took you
when you were just a child.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.000
And I did as much to you.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.560
I'm sorry.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.480
I'm sorry.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.360
I know.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.000
Your Ma, she's in a fight!

36:40.040 --> 36:42.480
Charlotte Wells has her hands
around her throat.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.960
How do you know that?

36:49.160 --> 36:50.480
Where have you been?

36:52.960 --> 36:56.280
Is Quigley paying you to spy?

36:56.360 --> 36:59.520
Must I shake you
to jangle all her coins?

36:59.600 --> 37:02.320
Why do you hate her?

37:04.640 --> 37:08.400
Going somewhere, Lord Fallon?

37:08.480 --> 37:11.320
The Archon wants to see us.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.920
I'm taking my mistress
out of town.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.400
No you're not.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.600
I told him that a justice

37:15.680 --> 37:17.680
has been sniffing
around my boots.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.920
He will see us... now.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.800
Send the carriage
for Charlotte.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.320
I have an errand first.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.360
I must bid farewell to a friend.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.520
I can't leave London
while she's still at Quigley's.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.960
What a loyal sister you are.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.320
Be loyal to me.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.640
Thank you...

38:19.760 --> 38:22.080
for your care of her.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.800
I do it for her safety.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.520
You have your wish now.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.160
Her marriage flounders

38:32.280 --> 38:36.200
and you are free to cast
your glamour once again.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.120
I have never stood in her way.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.200
It's you that's thwarted her,
not I.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.480
Here.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.360
Tell me how she looks.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.320
Better than before.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.480
So there is a witness
who saw you stab the justice

39:34.520 --> 39:36.880
and you have what
in trying to dispatch him?

39:36.960 --> 39:38.480
lt was an accident.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.376
A girl still lives who can
name you as her attacker.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.040
I didn't see her,
she moved into my path.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.800
His response to this disaster

39:43.880 --> 39:45.840
which puts us all at risk
is to run.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.360
I was not running.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.080
At Thermopylae,
the Spartans didn't flee.

39:49.160 --> 39:53.280
You are the liability,
you drunken, careless oaf.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.960
This enmity will never do.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.440
Only together
are we unassailable.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.920
We shall neither falter
nor flinch.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.160
Will you tell the others?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.040
There's no need...

40:06.120 --> 40:07.640
unless you run.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.520
I have the Wells girl
as my surety.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.160
And witnesses can perish.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.760
ln Sparta, the defenses
were impregnable.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.480
And deserters had their bollocks
ploughed into the soil.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.800
My ma was small.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.480
"Any flotsam passing,"
she'd say.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.000
"You cling to it.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.120
Keep yourself afloat."

40:42.200 --> 40:44.840
I chose the wrong raft.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.680
I'm sorry.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.520
I should put you out.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.560
But that would upset
my softhearted Charles.

41:01.600 --> 41:05.920
So from now on,
Cherry Dorrington,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.360
you're my little spy,
do you understand?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.160
From now on...

41:14.280 --> 41:17.120
you work for me.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.360
I fear for her, Charlotte.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.280
Look after her for me.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.600
Mumma.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.600
Charles!

41:57.680 --> 41:59.320
My own boy.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.080
Those Wells women won't stop
until I am dead.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.800
This is their doing.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.320
This hatred has to stop.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.600
lt will, I promise you.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.000
I will burn their house down.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.280
I will burn them both.

42:17.360 --> 42:18.280
Don't say that.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.760
I will see them die in agony.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.040
No, Mumma, no.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.520
And your horrid
doxy plots with them.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.480
She's their familiar,
their pert demon.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.200
You cannot say
anything about her.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.640
lt breaks my heart
how she abuses you.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.360
That's enough.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.400
Emily's going to have my baby.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.280
She's part of our family now.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.256
I couldn't fart without fear
of giving myself away.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.880
I couldn't belch,
I couldn't swear.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.760
How those girls of hers live,

42:47.840 --> 42:50.400
quelling their spirits,
constantly daunted and afraid.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.960
There's some part of her
that's missing,

42:54.000 --> 42:58.160
some box in a machine
where her heart used to be.

43:00.480 --> 43:04.200
I want to roar and scream

43:04.320 --> 43:06.960
and shout,
"I am Charlotte Wells!"

43:08.960 --> 43:10.800
And so you are.

43:16.080 --> 43:21.120
Fanny, you look after
that baby.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.520
Are you going soft?

43:23.600 --> 43:25.280
Hey.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.040
Now where?

43:29.120 --> 43:30.920
Our family is here.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.080
I want news of Amelia.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.960
Let one of your girls go.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.840
I spoke harshly
to her mother this morning.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.480
I will not add to her woes.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.960
Take care of things for me.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.680
What else?

44:14.480 --> 44:17.200
Why do you think
Lord Fallon's your enemy?

44:17.320 --> 44:19.440
He was going to help you.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.600
He can protect us both.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.280
He can protect this whole house.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.480
You should be loyal to him.

44:25.560 --> 44:28.440
Lucy, you're not
talking like yourself.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.000
Maybe I'm becoming myself.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.960
Properly, for the first time!

44:37.680 --> 44:39.160
Charlotte.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.120
Your ladyship's here.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.480
I'm not done with you.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.840
I've always been a flop
beside her.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.640
That's what you all think,
isn't it?

44:58.320 --> 45:00.760
What are you talking about?

45:03.360 --> 45:07.360
Why can't you see that Fallon
is my first success?

45:13.480 --> 45:16.120
Tell Charlotte I've gone to bed.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.040
I need to see the justice.

45:40.760 --> 45:44.640
You'd do anything to save
your child, wouldn't you?

45:44.760 --> 45:47.920
You know I would.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.600
We are the same in that.

45:51.680 --> 45:58.320
Tell me, what is the punishment
for murder, Mr. Hunt?

45:58.400 --> 46:00.480
lt is death.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.760
Even when a person
has confessed?

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
Murder is murder.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.200
Then so be it.

46:12.320 --> 46:15.000
I confess to the murder
of Sir George Howard.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.000
He was with my daughter, Lucy,

46:20.040 --> 46:23.840
and she was screaming "no."

46:23.920 --> 46:26.480
Anger overcame me...

46:26.520 --> 46:27.960
You do not refuse me.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.800
...when I stuck him
with a knife.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.480
And then I put my hands
around his neck

46:41.560 --> 46:44.680
and I pressed until
his throat collapsed.

46:49.960 --> 46:52.960
We made it look like
he was drunk

46:53.000 --> 46:57.040
and I paid lackeys
to dump his body in the park.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.000
ls this true?

47:06.160 --> 47:08.040
As I breathe.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.440
Do you understand
the consequence

47:11.480 --> 47:13.120
of what you have just said?

47:19.960 --> 47:21.920
Please wait.

47:28.840 --> 47:31.040
Why have you told him
such a thing?

47:33.320 --> 47:37.800
lt is my reckoning,
Mrs. Scanwell.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.280
Tell me...

47:42.040 --> 47:44.600
am I to hope for salvation?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.520
My prayers will be with you.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
And mine with you.

48:03.800 --> 48:07.480
My secret is a child.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.200
A daughter,
born when I was very young.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.640
She's at a private
boarding school in Chelsea.

48:15.760 --> 48:19.920
Sometimes I ride
and watch her from the park.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.680
I've never tried to contact her.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.480
That's how she survives.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.600
You must move her.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.680
Lydia is vengeful.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.400
So is my brother.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.880
He bragged this morning,
selfsatisfied,

48:39.960 --> 48:41.200
at what he'd done.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.080
The girl he raped,

48:47.160 --> 48:49.600
she cursed me.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.480
lt was his crime, not yours.

48:54.640 --> 48:59.040
And everything he did
was in punishment of me.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.480
How?

49:00.520 --> 49:03.160
Why?

49:03.280 --> 49:04.960
For rejecting him.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.080
When I was very young,

49:11.160 --> 49:13.080
he damned me with his lust.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.800
My child, she is his.

49:17.880 --> 49:20.360
He doesn't know.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.080
You're not damned.

49:25.160 --> 49:26.840
I am.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.440
You will be sentenced tomorrow.

49:48.080 --> 49:51.160
Now that I'm here...

49:51.280 --> 49:53.520
I can tell you the name
of the man

49:53.600 --> 49:55.400
who stabbed Amelia.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.360
It is Lord Fallon.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.360
When you arrest him,

50:05.440 --> 50:07.400
he will tell you a foul lie,

50:07.480 --> 50:09.560
he will say it was my Lucy

50:09.640 --> 50:12.480
who killed his friend
Sir George.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.480
But you'll know that isn't true

50:15.560 --> 50:17.800
because I confessed

50:17.880 --> 50:21.760
and his lie means nothing.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.680
Mrs. Wells.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.120
What can I do for you?

50:37.880 --> 50:41.320
Have grace toward my daughters.

50:42.760 --> 50:45.960
I'm cursed, you're damned.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.960
What a pair we are.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.200
No one has ever
touched me since.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.280
No one ever will.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.000
Why should you
forever be alone?

51:06.360 --> 51:08.280
Let me break his spell.

51:21.680 --> 51:25.680
For you, what can I do?

51:26.920 --> 51:29.960
I know what's to come.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
So don't make a pageant
of my hanging.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.440
Do it quietly...

51:35.480 --> 51:37.200
and do it fast.
