♪♪

00:06.640 --> 00:07.806
Nature.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.476
Makes us sneeze,
puts us in the infirmary.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.177
Nature.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.946
What's he got
against nature?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.280
Isn't he running
the Nature Club?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.448
He's only running
the Nature Club

00:16.450 --> 00:18.183
because it was either that
or the Ski Club.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.952
So why didn't he choose
the Ski Club?

00:19.954 --> 00:21.687
He can't run the Ski Club
because of what happened

00:21.689 --> 00:23.722
and the Mount Sun Lodge
when they were our age.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.057
Nature.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.760
The only place
a bear can kill ya from.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.195
Nature.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.897
Well, what happened
at the ski lodge?

00:31.899 --> 00:33.298
(whispers)
A mountain girl
kissed him.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.900
I didn't kiss her back.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.336
Nature.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.738
How 'bout I throw you
back in the street where
ya came from, you waif?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.510
Those were very bad times
for Cory and Topanga,

00:44.512 --> 00:47.413
but everything's fine now,
except we can't ski ever

00:47.415 --> 00:49.715
or say "ski"
or walk downhill.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.383
So why is he all upset
with nature?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.018
Guess where the hike is.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.421
The Mount Sun Lodge.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.022
Nature.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.724
(clattering)

01:00.361 --> 01:01.693
What are you doing, Dad?

01:01.695 --> 01:05.030
The ski lodge was almost
the end of Cory and Topanga,

01:05.032 --> 01:06.565
America's sweethearts.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.535
And now, I know something's
gonna happen there for you.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.504
So, I am preparing ya...
for nature.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.577
We're just going up
to see the leaves change color.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.446
Nature puts on a great show
when it wants to.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.447
Indeed, Zay.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.781
The leaves seem
to scream out...

01:22.783 --> 01:24.516
-"Hey, look at me!"
-"You think I'm pretty!"

01:24.518 --> 01:26.885
"But I'm actually dead."

01:26.887 --> 01:29.555
The preceding was brought to you
by the Smarkle Corporation.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.457
Explaining big concepts
with little words...

01:31.459 --> 01:32.825
(snazzy tone)
for you.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.228
All right, before
we get on the bus,

01:36.230 --> 01:39.298
I want to talk to you guys
about the other kind of nature.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.600
The human kind.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.868
Here it comes.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.704
Ohh, I've been on
these kind of trips before.

01:47.041 --> 01:50.209
We made our plans,
we had our blueprints.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.278
Well, you know
what's gonna happen to
all your little teenage plans?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.379
Nothin'!

01:54.381 --> 01:55.848
Why not?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.718
Because I am gonna
be your chaperone,

01:59.720 --> 02:04.389
and I will be doggin' you
every step like a dog.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.458
What makes you think
we're like that, Matthews?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.026
Get a load of Yogi
and Darby over here.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.729
Uh, they go by Yoby now.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.998
Yeah. Didn't you see their ad
in the school newspaper?

02:16.604 --> 02:18.070
Well...
(chuckles)

02:18.072 --> 02:19.805
it's not Yoby
I'm worried about anyway.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.906
Yoby's forever.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.010
It's this three-headed,
creeping triangle

02:25.012 --> 02:26.845
that won't die
that concerns me.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.514
-Why do you have to...
-Bring that up...

02:28.516 --> 02:30.449
For?

02:30.451 --> 02:34.453
Because the triangle is going
to the great outdoors.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.456
So, we are gonna need
some great chaperons.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.591
We got this completely
under control, Matthews.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.194
My human nature is
completely under control

02:42.196 --> 02:44.863
and there's nothin' or nobody
who could ever change that.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.266
Hey, kiddies.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.435
(giggles nervously)

02:50.437 --> 02:51.737
I'm wrong.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.073
Here we go.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.377
You're my chaperone.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.648
-I invited him.
-I love you!

03:02.650 --> 03:04.149
I'm coming too.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.185
I invited her.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.386
I'm smart.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.520
We'll be watching over you.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.555
'Kay.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.023
My name's Josh,
and I'll be with you

03:11.025 --> 03:13.725
all day and all night,
so no monkey business.

Who does that?

04:20.194 --> 04:21.460
Nobody.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.029
Ooh! Bay window!

04:24.031 --> 04:25.430
Bay window right now.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.234
Lauren did not age well.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.469
I'm just saying.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.273
Hey, did anyone else feel like
Mr. Matthews' nature lecture

04:34.275 --> 04:35.641
was completely pointed at us?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.042
Isn't everything?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.644
Hey, we put the brakes
on the whole triangle thing

04:38.646 --> 04:39.945
so that Maya could
find herself.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.880
Yes. I needed
to find myself,

04:41.882 --> 04:45.550
you Cactus Pete Huckleberry
horseback-ridin' Ranger Rick.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.252
Huh hugghhrr, huh hugghhrr,
huh hugghhrr-hugghhrr!

04:47.254 --> 04:48.453
And she's back...

04:48.455 --> 04:49.955
And we're back on.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.458
Yeah, except
for one other thing.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.397
Hey, Boing has nothing
to do with this, okay?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.399
He's just a fantasy.
You don't go out
with a fantasy.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.501
You only think
about him all the time.
What's the matter with you?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.369
Yeah, I'm real messed up.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.673
When's the first nature hike,

05:07.675 --> 05:08.940
dreamboat?

05:08.942 --> 05:10.575
Smackle, do you even know
who this is?

05:10.577 --> 05:12.577
-He's Maya's Boing.
-Then why would
you call him dreamboat?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.613
Look at him.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.648
Okay, while Cory and Topanga
are checking us in,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.517
let me welcome you all
to Mount Sun Lodge,

05:18.519 --> 05:19.985
where we are here
to turn our thoughts

05:19.987 --> 05:22.321
away from our
indoor relationships

05:22.323 --> 05:24.523
and towards our relationships
with the outdoors.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.259
Yeah, I don't think so,
Cub Scout.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.867
You brought them here
on Couples Weekend?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.869
Of course I did.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.771
"Nature Sez:
Tree's A crowd."

05:39.773 --> 05:40.806
Huh.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.507
"Moonlight Walk:
Triangle Trail."

05:42.509 --> 05:43.542
Huh.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.411
"Riley, Maya, Lucas:
Enough Already!"

05:47.481 --> 05:48.680
Huh.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.361
I'm sorry you had to miss
the first hike, Riley.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.131
Oh, I've been having
a really nice time, actually.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.400
Looking at things,
talking to people.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.941
-You two stay away
from each other.
-(both whimper)

06:20.247 --> 06:22.714
-How was it?
-Oh, just like you'd think.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.182
Farkle wandered off the trail,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.884
and Maya broke the rules
and went after him.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.353
Maya, you broke the rules?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.688
Yeah. She always
breaks the rules,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.656
but this time,
she could have been killed.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.758
It's like you never know
when to stop.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.559
-Farkle.
-She saved my life.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.194
Wait, what happened?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.330
I was chasing a rare
Achemon Sphinx Moth
for my collection.

06:38.332 --> 06:39.765
I have one.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.767
He was flying around
like he was taunting me,

06:41.769 --> 06:42.901
and no one taunts Farkle!

06:42.903 --> 06:43.969
-F-lehh.
-F-lahh!

06:45.406 --> 06:47.672
I grabbed him out of the air,
looked him in the eye, and said,

06:47.674 --> 06:50.542
"Achemon?
(scoffs) Ache-mine!"

06:50.544 --> 06:53.512
Now tell them
what really happened, honey.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.746
He tricked me.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.248
He flew over there,
and I went after him

06:56.250 --> 06:57.749
and slipped off
the edge of the trail.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.784
I was hanging on
by a tree branch.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.851
I was hanging
by my fingertips.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.287
Maya tears off,
jumps up, and saves him.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.555
What were you doing?

07:03.557 --> 07:05.090
I was saving Smackle.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.425
What happened to you?

07:06.427 --> 07:09.728
I was all,
"Help, Lucas. Help."

07:09.730 --> 07:11.396
All while Farkle was
hanging from a tree?

07:11.398 --> 07:12.631
No, every chance I get.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.368
Come on, Lone Star.
You're not really mad at me.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.637
You like when we tangle.
That's what you like about me.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.871
You just don't want
to admit it.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.375
No, it's not, Maya.

07:23.377 --> 07:24.776
I don't think it is.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.752
Why are you with us?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.487
'Cause as crazy
as you two are,

07:35.489 --> 07:37.355
you're nowhere near
as messed up as them.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.826
You okay?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.161
Oh! Yeah.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.930
Yeah, I was just sitting here
and this leaf blew in.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.298
You ever see
a color like this?

07:47.468 --> 07:49.634
It knew it had to leave the tree
and become something else.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.769
It knew it was time.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.571
You're always such a romantic.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.573
I am. I love romance.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.108
This triangle
has to die right now.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.343
What? Why?

07:58.345 --> 07:59.511
How?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.079
We've tried before.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.481
Yeah.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.050
But this time,
there's something stronger.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.086
Seasons change.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.688
It's nature.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.558
And nature knows that it's time
for the triangle to die.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.301
Okay, triangle over.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.803
Our mothers told us
that you made a choice.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.439
Yeah, I did,
but this shouldn't be my choice.

08:27.441 --> 08:28.707
It should be a decision
that we all make.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.442
I got no pride.
Just flip a coin.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.143
Let's get a pizza.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.512
Movie night!

08:33.514 --> 08:35.313
-Movie night!
-Both: Coward!

08:35.315 --> 08:36.348
I know.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.782
All right, we got
a bunch to pick from,

08:37.784 --> 08:38.817
so let's see
what we got here.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.018
I want a spy thriller.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.720
Two spies in love
with lots of danger.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.855
Why does it always gotta be
danger with you?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.790
(gasps) Romance!
I want to cry my eyes out!

08:45.792 --> 08:48.159
Boy meets girl,
boy stays with girl,

08:48.161 --> 08:50.228
nothing bad happens.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.697
The end.
(chokes up)

08:53.967 --> 08:57.369
Okay, so dangerous life with you
and crying my eyes out with you.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.703
That's what we got here?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.838
No other choices?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.740
Oh, believe me,
the story of your lives

09:01.742 --> 09:03.408
is better than
whatever we got here.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.378
Okay, well,

09:06.380 --> 09:07.979
if we're actually
gonna decide this,

09:07.981 --> 09:10.916
then we should imagine
what our lives would
be like together.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.250
Okay.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.352

09:53.527 --> 09:55.427
Huckleberry Bond.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.873
All right, let's go over
the mission.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.141
The Purple Cat is evil.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.277
She must be destroyed
or she'll destroy us.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.545
Got it.

10:14.548 --> 10:15.814
Careful.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.483
We're in Purple territory now.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.559
The cool cat howls
at the moon.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.327
Purple is the color
of midnight.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.830
The triangle is sharp
and pointed,

10:31.832 --> 10:33.298
and somebody
will get hurt.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.969
Why we talkin' like this?

10:37.971 --> 10:38.970
Just say "meow"
and come in.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.973
Meow and come in.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.347
Welcome to
The Purple Cat Club,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.851
where the world is yours
and there's only one rule:

10:52.853 --> 10:54.219
Don't open that curtain!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.890
Other than that,
have fun.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.462
Well, looky here,
ladies and gents.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.864
Two new players.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.132
They call me The Bomb.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.600
You got a real name?

11:08.602 --> 11:10.135
Yup.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.637
I'mma call you
whatever you want.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.938
Wise choice.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.507
And what do they call
you, handsome?

11:15.509 --> 11:16.941
They call me Crybaby.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.009
Why?

11:18.011 --> 11:21.680
(cries)
I don't know.
I wish they'd stop.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.382
What's your name, gorgeous?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.884
The name's Bond.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.485
Huckleberry Bond.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.687
(growls)

11:28.689 --> 11:29.821
Smackle!

11:29.823 --> 11:31.856
I'm with you
in this too?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.560
Gorgeous is with me, chipmunk.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.062
We're the power couple
of the world

11:37.064 --> 11:38.897
and there's nothing that
could ever tear us apart.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.900
Who dat?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.235
The name's Boing.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.737
Uncle Boing.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.972
I'm three years older than you.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.642
You're three years older
than me in this too?

11:50.644 --> 11:52.043
And I'm a billionaire.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.446
(whimpers)

11:55.882 --> 11:57.048
Don't matter!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.683
'Cause we're
the power couple
of the world,

11:58.685 --> 12:00.919
and there's nothing that
could ever tear us apart.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.658
-The Purple Cat!
-The Purple Cat!

12:06.660 --> 12:08.359
-The Purple Cat!
-Purple Cat!

12:08.361 --> 12:09.461
Ow.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.565
All right, nobody move.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.467
I got a little something to say.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.673
This isn't how it would be!

12:21.675 --> 12:24.042
You're just jealous that
our lives together would be

12:24.044 --> 12:27.178
action and adventure
and Lucas and I would
save the world.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.947
You'd-- you'd tear
each other into pieces.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.950
What are y'all looking at?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.418
You.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.453
We've been watching this thing
for the past two years.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.522
Wanna see how it ends.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.023
You think we'd tear
each other to pieces?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.125
Yeah, I can see it.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.960
Stop helping her.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.394
This doesn't need any help.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.897
I know you two.
I know how this ends.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.932
(spy music plays)

12:47.934 --> 12:50.301
Well, you two are new
to my establishment.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.072
Huckleberry Bond and...

12:54.074 --> 12:55.974
The Bomb.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.980
Trust me, I know
what "The Bomb" is,
and you ain't it.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.449
And I got a feeling that
your name isn't Huckleberry.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.351
It's Lucas, ma'am.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.053
(Texan accent)
It's Lucas, ma'am.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.088
I don't sound like that.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.158
I durr sar
fooeey garducky!

13:13.160 --> 13:14.959
You're a couple?

13:14.961 --> 13:17.061
We're gonna save
the world, sister.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.831
Hmm.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.667
Tell me, Lucas,

13:22.669 --> 13:25.970
if this ol' world
was gentler and kinder
and didn't need savin',

13:25.972 --> 13:28.139
what would you do in it?

13:28.141 --> 13:31.342
Well, uh, I've never told
anybody this before,

13:31.344 --> 13:34.312
but I've kind of always wanted
to be a veterinarian.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.980
(gasps)
You hear that, Violet?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.916
We got ourselves a doctor!

13:37.918 --> 13:39.684
She does know that
that's a stuffed cat, right?

13:41.822 --> 13:42.887
Okay.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.825
Hey, Maya,
what are you doin'?

13:46.827 --> 13:47.859
You know what
I'm gonna do.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.861
Why? They got one rule here.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.429
All you gotta do is
not break one rule.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.964
This is how I live
my life, Huckleberry.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.199
You're either with me
or you're not!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.034
(The Purple Cat gasps)

13:56.036 --> 13:58.036
Now that's a bomb.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.772
Opening the curtain
started the timer.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.540
All you gotta do
is cut the red wire.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.375
You knew what I was like
from the day you met me.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.177
Yeah. I didn't think
you would destroy
the world.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.213
Hey, if you're not gonna
destroy the world,
why do anything?

14:08.215 --> 14:09.447
All you gotta do
is cut the red wire.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.449
In five seconds,
your world will end

14:11.451 --> 14:12.817
and my world will begin.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.720
I will do my evil laugh now.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.555
(shrill laugh)

14:17.557 --> 14:19.824
Hey! Smile at me
exactly the same.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.159
(timer beeps)

14:21.161 --> 14:22.927
(cartoon explosion sounds)

14:24.030 --> 14:25.129
(cat yowl)

14:25.131 --> 14:27.165
Maya, we'd rather argue
with each other

14:27.167 --> 14:28.366
than save the world.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.834
Wah-wah.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.469
Well, there's a new world now.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.537
My world.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.139
And it's fabulous.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.041
Yeah? What's it look like?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.480
(cartoon explosion sounds)

14:43.416 --> 14:44.582
(cat meow)

14:44.584 --> 14:46.084
(romantic music plays)

14:46.086 --> 14:49.220
(Texan accent)
Well, here I am.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.624
Just a country boy
in a big ol' city.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.228
Wherever will I find a...

14:57.230 --> 15:00.098
kind, loving soul

15:00.100 --> 15:01.933
who'd enjoy my stories

15:01.935 --> 15:04.335
about birthin' the horses?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.373
I'm Riley.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.576
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!

15:21.221 --> 15:22.253
Sorry.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.422
I'm so quirky
and clumsy.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.190
Boys hate that.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.258
I'm Lucas.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.626
I love it.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.827
(twinkle sound)

15:34.301 --> 15:35.800
(romantic music plays)

15:35.802 --> 15:37.068
We should just say goodbye

15:37.070 --> 15:39.537
while we love each other
so, so much.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.873
Goodbye.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.809
(music stops)

15:45.745 --> 15:47.278
-I can't live without you.
-(music resumes)

15:47.280 --> 15:48.813
What a horrible
two seconds that was.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.316
-Lucas?
-Riley?

15:51.318 --> 15:52.617
Is it just me,
or has our love

15:52.619 --> 15:54.953
made the entire world
a better place?

15:58.558 --> 15:59.924
And look!

15:59.926 --> 16:02.160
There's Auggie as cupid
because we had to get him in.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.163
(harp plays)

16:05.165 --> 16:06.764
You're right, Riley.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.166
Look at everybody.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.902
Everyone is together.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.770
The world is at peace.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.305
Everyone is in love.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.273
How can you tell?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.275
I'm that tall.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.544
Well, get back down here
and kiss me.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.350
-Wait a minute.
-(romantic music winds down)

16:25.352 --> 16:26.985
What?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.786
Where is she?
You know that she'd never
let us kiss each other.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.888
-I have your results.
-(dramatic music plays)

16:32.158 --> 16:33.925
It's the worst possible news.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.593
Do your findings concur
with mine?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.261
You mean that
it's the worst possible news?

16:37.263 --> 16:38.963
Mm, yes, those findings.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.299
What bad could possibly happen?

16:41.301 --> 16:42.834
Everyone is in love.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.302
The world is happy.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.503
(harp plays)

16:45.505 --> 16:47.338
What could you have
possibly come up with?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.539
Oh, nothing.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.774
Except everybody's
gonna be dead.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.709
Why does everybody
always have to be dead?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.011
I will show you.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.312
(harp plays)

16:54.314 --> 16:56.314
Dr. Boing and I have been
working with each other,

16:56.316 --> 16:58.216
next to each other,
every single day.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.917
Tell them our research, Boing.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.021
Unfortunately, we are
still unable to make you

17:03.023 --> 17:04.389
not three years younger than me.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.690
-The other research.
-Oh!

17:05.692 --> 17:08.292
Uh, you all have
gooey sap disease.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.395
G.S.D.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.529
You're all feeling
things too much.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.498
It's melting you
from the inside.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.833
You all caught it
from Patient Zero.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.001
Guess who's Patient Zero?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.069
I am!

17:18.071 --> 17:20.705
But I just want
everybody to be in love.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.708
-I feel it so much that it...
-Hurts? Mm.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.210
Yes, and now you've hurt
everybody else, Riley,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.912
because not
everybody's like you.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.915
-Not everybody
can handle so much...
-Wonderful emotion.

17:30.917 --> 17:31.983
...gooey sap.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.518
Well, I don't believe you.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.752
The world is better for it.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.788
What bad could possibly happen?

17:38.224 --> 17:39.290
(grunts)

17:41.261 --> 17:42.326
(whimpers)

17:44.230 --> 17:46.097
Okay, well,
that's just them.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.899
Lucas and I are still alive.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.867
And now the Riley death scene.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.169
I wanna be in it!

17:52.105 --> 17:53.337
Oh.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.343
(sickly tone)
Lucas.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.879
Please go.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.183
I don't want you
to see me like this.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.254
Where are you going?
I'm dying!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.858
Riley, please don't leave me.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.626
There isn't anybody else
in this world.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.395
'Cause we're
the perfect couple?

18:17.397 --> 18:20.965
No, because there isn't
anybody else in this world.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.301
Except for her.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.869
And she's with him.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.436
Hey, no, no,
she's not with me.
I'm older than her.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.206
That's even gonna matter
when everybody else it dead?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.607
Okay, maybe not
if everybody else is dead.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.609
Wait a minute,
so you're saying

18:31.611 --> 18:32.877
when we get back
to real life,

18:32.879 --> 18:34.579
all I gotta do is
get rid of everybody else?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.147
-Maya, it's about them now.
-Wait a minute.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.049
Seriously, all I have to do
is get rid of everybody else?

18:38.051 --> 18:40.718
Yeah, that's it.
That-- that's all
you gotta do.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.120
Wait, hold on.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.055
So you're saying no matter
who I end up with...

18:44.057 --> 18:45.490
It's the end of the world.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.724
Way to go.

18:46.726 --> 18:50.128
That can't happen in my world,
'cause I know that

18:50.130 --> 18:52.330
true love will
always keep us alive.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.499
(flatline beep)

18:54.501 --> 18:55.900
(grunts)

18:57.971 --> 18:59.337
Riley?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.105
What happened?

19:01.107 --> 19:04.142
"Blah, blah, blah..."

19:04.144 --> 19:05.176
Wait a minute!

19:05.178 --> 19:06.811
I wasn't even
plugged in to anything!

19:08.581 --> 19:09.847
Maya!

19:13.186 --> 19:14.986
(applause)

19:16.523 --> 19:18.256
Wait, no, stop.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.857
None of that is
what's going to happen.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.325
We care about
each other too much

19:21.327 --> 19:22.827
to let anything
like that happen, right?

19:22.829 --> 19:23.961
I hope so.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.530
We do.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.098
So, I hope
you guys aren't looking
for some big fight...

19:27.100 --> 19:29.433
'Cause there
isn't gonna be one.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.836
-(all whimper)
-But we wanted one!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.538
They already said
there isn't gonna be one.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.972
-But I wanted one!
-You wanna have one?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.307
-Yeah!
-No.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.675
Boy, that was a quick one.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.450
Maybe my dad was right.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.986
Maybe we can't decide this.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.489
Maybe only nature can,

19:51.491 --> 19:53.691
because nature is
what's stronger than us.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.826
So our lives are
just gonna depend

19:55.828 --> 19:57.862
on whatever nature
decides to do with us?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.697
Or what we do
with our human nature.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.233
Aren't we smart enough
to know what to do?

20:02.235 --> 20:03.568
I believe we are.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.153
You know what?
She's right.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.737
No matter what we decide,
this is our world

20:06.739 --> 20:09.006
and it's only the right decision
if we stay friends.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.641
We can control that, right?

20:12.245 --> 20:14.345
Actually, this brings up
an interesting question.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.480
Who is in control
of your life?

20:16.482 --> 20:18.549
I am! Now go to bed.

20:19.819 --> 20:20.985
Lesson over.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.490
Yeah, it's a good thing
you invited me here.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.827
Riles, you want help
up the stairs?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.329
Not really tired.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.563
Mom?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.398
Is it okay
if I stay awake for a bit?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.499
Just a bit.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.403
Come on, Riles.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.606
You really think nature
is just gonna have an answer

20:41.608 --> 20:43.458
blow in with the wind?

20:43.459 --> 20:45.309
Just want to look
at the sky a while.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.725
Thought you could use this.

21:34.727 --> 21:38.296
Oh, thanks,
but I was just looking
at the sky a while.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.332
Okay, but could you take
one of these anyway?

21:41.334 --> 21:42.633
Because hot.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.570
You here with
the New York group?

21:46.572 --> 21:47.838
Yeah.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.474
That's why you like the sky.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.842
Why?

21:51.844 --> 21:53.944
Well, because you can't really
see it in New York.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.079
Why not?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.415
Too much ambient light.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.751
This is where they keep
all the stars, huh?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.086
Yeah.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.587
I'll tell you a secret.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.856
When everyone else
has gone upstairs,

22:05.858 --> 22:08.926
I sit right where you are
and I'll watch this sky too.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.663
-It's amazing, isn't it?
-Yeah.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.032
And it goes all night.
