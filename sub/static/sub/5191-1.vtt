01:56.652 --> 02:00.690
THIS RIP SEEMS TO BE OUT OF SYNC.

02:00.790 --> 02:03.859
In order to fix it, use mkvmerge:

02:11.167 --> 02:13.970
A) Click 'Add' to load the movie
(or just drag the mkv file into mkvmerge)

02:14.003 --> 02:17.608
B) Highlight the AC3 audio track and click
the 'Format specific options' tab.

02:26.516 --> 02:28.652
C) On 'Delay (in ms)', enter "200" with no quotation marks.

02:28.719 --> 02:30.687
D) Make sure you have enough HDD roo for the new file
before clicking 'Start muxing'.

02:30.787 --> 02:32.856
In a few minutes you should get a properly synched file.
These subs here are synched accordingly.

02:32.923 --> 02:36.827
If you didn't notice anything wrong with the audio
in the first place and want to just leave it as it is,
please re-synch my subs for them no to show up too late.
Set them to -200 ms with Subtitle Workshop or any other software.

02:46.336 --> 02:48.872
Enjoy your movie. :)
