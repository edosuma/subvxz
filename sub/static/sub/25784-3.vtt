Just threw my Poquito Más

Listen, I'm just glad
you're finally getting
your own place.

03:09.165 --> 03:11.873
Yeah. I mean,
I'm not gonna lie,

03:11.957 --> 03:13.749
staying at Daniel's
is kinda nice.

03:13.832 --> 03:16.998
What's so nice about
sleeping on the couch?

03:17.082 --> 03:19.290
Um... yeah.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.290
Ohh, girl, no.

03:23.374 --> 03:25.915
The couch got uncomfortable,
so we just started

03:25.998 --> 03:27.249
sleeping in bed together.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.082
But just side by side.
Platonically.

03:29.165 --> 03:32.040

- It's not like we fuckin'.

03:32.123 --> 03:33.415

03:33.499 --> 03:35.791
I mean, has the thought
crossed my mind? Yeah.

03:35.873 --> 03:37.415
Do I think about it a lot?
Duh.

03:37.499 --> 03:40.082
Am I thinking about it
right now? No.

03:40.165 --> 03:41.499
Yeah.

03:41.582 --> 03:43.998
But it's more than that,
you know? We...

03:44.082 --> 03:46.707
We really started connecting,
and I just don't
want to mess that up.

03:46.791 --> 03:47.915

03:57.832 --> 03:59.873

04:03.123 --> 04:06.249
So I figure we can
put the poster here

04:06.332 --> 04:08.624
so that the applicants
can get to know us, too.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.957

04:20.666 --> 04:23.165

04:23.249 --> 04:24.998

04:25.082 --> 04:26.749

Geoffrey Canada.

04:26.832 --> 04:29.541
Oh, for real?
That's crazy.

04:29.624 --> 04:33.624
The work he's done
with the Harlem Children's Zone
is just amazing.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.791
- He's a personal hero.
- Yeah, I am excited, too.

04:36.873 --> 04:38.832
It's about time we hired
another person of color.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.873
I literally
couldn't agree more.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.207
Though technically,
I think it's illegal

04:44.290 --> 04:45.541
to hire anyone
because of their race.

04:45.624 --> 04:48.499
Right. But we're not
about to waste time

04:48.582 --> 04:49.957

no offense.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.749
No. We've given white people
enough time.

- What do we do?

09:03.749 --> 09:06.415
We work with
musically gifted kids
in the neighborhood.

09:06.499 --> 09:09.749
We give 'em private lessons.
We expose them to
different kinds of music.

09:09.832 --> 09:11.541

stuff like that.

09:11.624 --> 09:13.415
That's so cool.

my mom took me to see

09:15.749 --> 09:17.249
- Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
- OK.

09:17.332 --> 09:21.499

but it was dope.

09:54.791 --> 09:57.040
that they still need to install
DocuSign on my computer?

09:57.123 --> 09:59.873
- Oh, we don't use DocuSign.
- Huh?

09:59.957 --> 10:01.499
You can encrypt and send
with Adobe,

10:01.582 --> 10:04.123
but that's like a whole thing,
so we just use a courier.

10:04.207 --> 10:06.499
Really? DocuSign
is so much faster.

10:06.582 --> 10:07.707
Sorry.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.957
Pickups are usually
9:00, noon, and 5:00

10:10.040 --> 10:13.040
But if Rashad's doing the run,
it's more like 5:30.

10:13.123 --> 10:14.957
He lucky he cute.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.915
Ohh. OK.

10:19.290 --> 10:21.749
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, it's fine.

10:21.832 --> 10:24.249
We just did things
a different way
at my old firm.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.332
And over here
are the mailboxes.

10:35.415 --> 10:37.415
You'd be responsible
for keeping this area clean.

10:37.499 --> 10:39.666
Tenants just leave
PennySavers everywhere.

10:39.749 --> 10:41.499
Where's the trash?

10:41.582 --> 10:44.499
- That'd be Trina in 2A.
- ( laughs )

10:44.582 --> 10:48.666
Shouldn't laugh.
Trina got problems. So...

10:48.749 --> 10:50.666
you don't have any experience
managing apartments?

10:50.749 --> 10:53.998
Well, no, but
I'm a great problem-solver,

10:54.082 --> 10:56.873
I did a ton of research,
and I'm confident
I can handle it.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.165
- Research, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.249 --> 11:00.915
Did you learn
how to work a plunger?

11:00.998 --> 11:03.624
Don't you just kinda...

11:03.707 --> 11:06.123
plunge?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.541
- There's more to it than that.
- This is part-time?

11:09.624 --> 11:11.457
Sure,
but you gotta be on call.

11:22.123 --> 11:23.624
It's a lot of wood.

11:28.707 --> 11:30.873
So this is renting
for 1500?

11:30.957 --> 11:33.165
Well, not if you're
the property manager.

11:33.249 --> 11:34.541
For you it'd be 750.

11:34.624 --> 11:36.374
I'm sorry, seven-fif-what?

11:36.457 --> 11:39.374
Look, your references
checked out,
you got a college degree,

11:39.457 --> 11:42.040
and not on of them
online shits like the gardener.

11:42.123 --> 11:44.791
How you gonna learn
about horticulture on the 'net?

11:57.332 --> 11:59.541
Roger:

12:07.123 --> 12:11.915
♪ Just so good
at being in trouble... ♪

12:11.998 --> 12:15.582

out of my track.

12:15.666 --> 12:17.873
I put the strings in there
for a reason.

12:17.957 --> 12:20.499
Um, actually,
those are mine.

12:20.582 --> 12:23.207
Oh ho ho ho!
I'm sorry, baby.

12:24.998 --> 12:27.499
You know I been listening
to that Nordic music, right?

12:27.582 --> 12:29.123
Yeah, from Nordic...land.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.582
That's the sound
I wanted to come through.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.624
And it's like,
it's my motherfuckin' track.

12:33.707 --> 12:36.040
People gonna think
I'm about that simple shit,
you know?

12:36.123 --> 12:38.791
I hear you.
For what it's worth,
I thought it was a bop.

12:38.873 --> 12:41.040
And when you get
to the next level,

12:41.123 --> 12:42.957

I don't know.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.749
Hey, if you ever need a bitch
to play the tambourine,

12:48.832 --> 12:50.791
I'm available.

12:50.873 --> 12:52.666
Oh, you available?

12:52.749 --> 12:54.249
- For the right project.
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.998 --> 13:01.040
Hey, I meant to tell you,
um, I got a job offer.

13:02.541 --> 13:03.832
To manage an apartment.

13:03.915 --> 13:05.749
( laughs ) What?

13:05.832 --> 13:08.123
More importantly,
I can move out

13:08.207 --> 13:10.123
and finally
find my own spot.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.374
That just sound
like hella work.

13:12.457 --> 13:15.499
You managed to lock yourself
out of my place four times?

13:15.582 --> 13:19.165
Five. 'Cause one time
it happened back-to-back.

13:19.249 --> 13:22.457
So you're gonna be doing that,
working at We Got Y'All,

13:22.541 --> 13:24.873
and  driving Lyft?
That's a lot.

13:24.957 --> 13:27.082
Yeah, but you been so cool,

13:27.165 --> 13:28.832
I don't want to keep
bumming it at your spot.

13:28.915 --> 13:30.915
You're not bumming.
All right?

13:30.998 --> 13:32.249
You're not bumming.

13:32.332 --> 13:34.457
I like you bein' there.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.290
Why don't we just,

13:40.873 --> 13:42.832
What you gonna do
when tenants don't
pay their rent, huh?

13:42.915 --> 13:45.666
You gonna shake somebody down?
You ain't tough.

13:45.749 --> 13:48.290
- I can be tough.
- Uh-huh.

13:48.374 --> 13:50.332

took my clothes?!

13:55.415 --> 13:58.873
Hey, I am gonna
go for a walk at lunch,
if you want to join me.

13:58.957 --> 14:02.374
I am in a Fitbit challenge
with my mother-in-law,
and I cannot lose.

14:02.457 --> 14:04.207
Well, I was actually
gonna work through lunch.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.873
I want to get a head start
on the Coleman case.

14:05.957 --> 14:07.541
I can help if you want.

14:07.624 --> 14:09.541
I'll just put
the Fitbit on my dog.
She ain't gonna know.

14:09.624 --> 14:11.541
Oh, wow, OK.
Thank you.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.499
- No problem.
- Appreciate it.

14:15.915 --> 14:20.541
Wow. Um, I thought these boxes
were going into storage.

14:20.624 --> 14:22.541
Your office is  the storage.

14:22.624 --> 14:24.666
Ha ha. OK.

14:24.749 --> 14:26.791
It's just, at my old firm,

14:26.873 --> 14:28.791
we used offsite storage.

14:28.873 --> 14:31.082
It's actually convenient
when you get used to it.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.749
Oh.

Then they sling loose files
in my office like
it's a damn Kinkos.

14:47.499 --> 14:51.624
And y'all, I got to log
my own billable hours--
by hand.

14:51.707 --> 14:53.791
Like, did I get
a demotion?

14:53.873 --> 14:55.415
You got problems
with white firms,

14:55.499 --> 14:57.541
problems with black firms--
you runnin' out of races.

14:57.624 --> 14:59.624
First of all, there are
Mexican law firms, too.

14:59.707 --> 15:01.707
I see them on
the back of buses
all the time.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.832
- Racist. Mm-mm.
- Molly: My point is,

15:03.915 --> 15:06.415
why do black businesses always
have to be on the struggle?

15:06.499 --> 15:07.915
Tiffany:
I'm with Molly on this one.

15:07.998 --> 15:09.582
We have to do better.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.957
We can't just leave it all
up to Chadwick Boseman.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.541
Right? If you're
gonna be a black law firm
in Century City,

15:15.624 --> 15:17.582
then be
a Century City law firm.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.415
It's like when black people
buy big-ass houses
and can't furnish it.

15:20.499 --> 15:23.082
My uncle got
an 8,000-square-feet house

15:23.165 --> 15:24.666
and just a bean bag.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.165
OK, you're being
mad judgmental right now.

15:27.249 --> 15:29.123
Are you sure you're not
looking down on them

15:29.207 --> 15:30.624
because  they're
a black law firm?

15:30.707 --> 15:33.332
We are harder on ourselves
than white people sometimes,

15:33.415 --> 15:37.499
because we've been conditioned
not to trust each other.

15:37.582 --> 15:39.207
Where'd my drink--

15:39.290 --> 15:41.457
Did you steal my drink?

15:41.541 --> 15:42.707
Kelli, the bartender took it.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.332
The black one.

15:44.415 --> 15:47.499
See? Like Tiffany--
you love Beyoncé,

15:47.582 --> 15:49.332
but did your ass
sign up for Tidal?

15:49.415 --> 15:52.123
Of course I did.
I just don't ever
go on it.

15:52.207 --> 15:53.666
Kelli:
And I hate to admit it,

15:53.749 --> 15:55.873
but even I have
a white accountant.

15:55.957 --> 15:58.082
- Kelli, what?
- Don't "at" me!

15:58.165 --> 16:00.082
( à la NeNe Leakes )
I said what I said!

16:00.165 --> 16:03.332
Look, you sound negative. OK?

16:03.415 --> 16:04.957
Just give it time.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.332
Change is hard.

16:06.415 --> 16:07.582
Amen to that.

16:07.666 --> 16:08.998
I mean, I love my baby--

16:09.082 --> 16:11.582
do I love not fitting
any of my clothes? No.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.499
Do I love that y'all
have a group chat
without me? No.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.541
- Wha...?
- No, we don't.

16:16.624 --> 16:18.374
We definitely do.
For sure.

16:18.457 --> 16:20.541
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.

16:20.624 --> 16:21.707
( laughing )
It's fine.
It's fine.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.624
It's fine. It's fine.

16:23.707 --> 16:25.332
It's. Fine.

16:25.415 --> 16:27.582
- OK.
- OK?

16:27.666 --> 16:30.832
This... is my new journey.

16:30.915 --> 16:32.290
And Molly,
maybe this is yours.

16:32.374 --> 16:34.749
( sighs )
I guess.

16:34.832 --> 16:37.040
I just hope you're not
complaining like this
at your job.

16:37.123 --> 16:38.249
No, just to y'all.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.832
Woman:
Carter, party of four.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.332
And a half!

16:41.415 --> 16:44.624
There gonna be
twelve more months
of this shit?

16:44.707 --> 16:46.998
Wait, what?

16:47.082 --> 16:49.832
So, none of you replied
to my email about Palm Springs.

16:49.915 --> 16:51.873
Or did you guys
talk about it
amongst yourselves?

16:51.957 --> 16:53.415
Hmm.

16:54.957 --> 16:57.541
Issa, I can see
over your shoulder.

16:57.624 --> 16:59.666
No,
that's about something else.

16:59.749 --> 17:00.998
Girl, we got your email.

17:01.082 --> 17:02.998
And yes, the Airbnb
works just fine.

17:03.082 --> 17:04.707
Kelli:
Oh, speaking
of needing places to stay,

17:04.791 --> 17:06.332
Issa, an apartment
came through.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.374
It's in your budget,
only got a half-bath,

17:08.457 --> 17:11.957
but there's a YMCA
up the block where
you can shower after 6:00.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.123
Ooh, that sounds promising.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.082
Yeah, actually, I'm good.

17:16.165 --> 17:20.249
I think I'm gonna tell Daniel
that I'm gonna stay longer.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.374
Oh, brown bread!
And they got a mix?

17:22.457 --> 17:23.666
I'ma Yelp that.

17:23.749 --> 17:27.082
Wait. Staying longer?

17:27.165 --> 17:28.082
Why?

17:28.165 --> 17:30.123
I told you not
to sleep in his bed.

17:30.207 --> 17:31.582
- Kelli: Unh-unh!
- Really?

17:31.666 --> 17:34.415
So you figured out
how to pay him after all.

17:34.499 --> 17:36.332
Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat! Ass.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.415
No. See, y'all
don't understand.

17:38.499 --> 17:40.123
We're not even
sleeping together,

17:40.207 --> 17:42.123
and we're getting along great.

17:42.207 --> 17:43.832
So what's the problem?

17:43.915 --> 17:47.415
It's Daniel. You and Daniel
is always  a problem.

17:47.499 --> 17:50.165
But it's not this time.
You know why?

17:50.249 --> 17:51.707
Because we're talkin' and shit.

17:51.791 --> 17:53.582
He's been there for me,

17:53.666 --> 17:56.290
and I think I'm finally
seeing him for who he really is.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.582
You're seein' him
because you don't got nut
in your eye.

17:58.666 --> 18:00.415
Ooh, duck confit. Yes.

18:00.499 --> 18:01.915
What Kelli...

18:01.998 --> 18:05.415
is trying  to say...

18:05.499 --> 18:07.249
is we care about you!

18:07.332 --> 18:09.624
- Yeah.
- And we don't want to see you

18:09.707 --> 18:11.582
end up in something
that, you know,

18:11.666 --> 18:13.290
- is not...
- ...great.

18:13.374 --> 18:15.165
Y'all, this is the first time

18:15.249 --> 18:17.666
that there's nothing
in the way of us
getting together.

18:17.749 --> 18:19.415
- So isn't that worth exploring?
- All: No!

18:19.499 --> 18:21.957
Y'all are just gonna
Greek chorus on a bitch?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.541
- All: Yes!
- Ya dumb bitch!

18:30.374 --> 18:33.123
I just,
I think it's on us

18:33.207 --> 18:35.624
to support
low-performing schools.

18:35.707 --> 18:37.374
Especially when
the federal government doesn't.

18:37.457 --> 18:40.666
Exactly. And programs
like yours have
tangible results.

18:40.749 --> 18:43.290
- So  tangible.
- Yeah.

18:43.374 --> 18:44.749
- Wow!
- Wow!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.998
- ( both laughing )
- "Wow."

18:47.082 --> 18:48.541
It is so good
to meet you right now.

18:48.624 --> 18:50.249
We Got Y'All

18:50.332 --> 18:51.582

five-year plan...

18:55.499 --> 18:57.457
Oh, yeah, good things
come in fives.

18:57.541 --> 19:01.457
- Yeah.
- Five-dollar foot-longs,

19:01.541 --> 19:04.582
um, Five Guys Burgers,

19:04.666 --> 19:08.582

19:17.998 --> 19:19.832

- OK?

19:19.915 --> 19:22.374
- I'll be right back. OK.
- OK.

19:30.624 --> 19:31.915
I like your sweater.

19:31.998 --> 19:34.541
Oh, thank you!
I found it outside.

19:34.624 --> 19:36.499
- At a flea market.
- Oh. ( laughs )

19:36.582 --> 19:39.290
I shoulda
led with that.

19:39.374 --> 19:41.582
So, how do you
like it here?

19:41.666 --> 19:44.791
Oh, it's--- it's great,
yeah. It's cool. I like it.

19:47.415 --> 19:49.249
How is it for you?

19:53.749 --> 19:56.207
You know.
They are how they are.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.998
Oh, yeah. I know.

19:58.082 --> 20:00.624
But honestly,
it's like any job.

20:00.707 --> 20:02.873
There's the good, the bad...

20:02.957 --> 20:04.624
Yeah. So how long
have you worked here?

20:04.707 --> 20:06.832
Uh, five years.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.707
Wow! So you must
really like it, then.

20:22.749 --> 20:23.957
( typing )

20:37.624 --> 20:40.915
We started the monthly meetings
to evaluate our client base.

20:40.998 --> 20:43.541
We needed a new way
to discuss case strategy.

20:43.624 --> 20:46.582
It's also an opportunity for us
to mentor the first-years.

20:46.666 --> 20:50.123
I love the collaborative
approach. The teamwork,
all of it.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.165
Guys, I'm so excited
to get started.

20:56.832 --> 20:59.457
So, where's Malcolm?
What, is he on CB time?

20:59.541 --> 21:01.332
( polite laughter )

21:01.415 --> 21:04.791
I love us. We are
so black up in here.
Can't even start on time.

21:04.873 --> 21:08.040
Actually, Malcolm
usually takes a call,

21:08.123 --> 21:11.374
and we get the meeting started
before he comes in.

21:11.457 --> 21:14.082
Oh. Right.
Of course.

21:14.165 --> 21:18.249
Maybe at her old firm
they started every meeting
on time.

21:18.332 --> 21:21.873
( all snickering )

21:27.749 --> 21:28.957
Daniel:
Appreciate you, dawg.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.666
Good-lookin',
good-lookin'.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.541
- What's up, nigga?
- What's up, my G?

21:34.624 --> 21:35.749
- You straight?
- You know.

21:35.832 --> 21:37.915
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:37.998 --> 21:39.749
You remember my boy Daniel
from the club
the other night, right?

21:39.832 --> 21:42.332
Yeah, yeah, the night
my boy got shot.

21:42.415 --> 21:44.873
Damn, for real?
He OK?

21:46.249 --> 21:47.791
Nah.

21:49.957 --> 21:51.165
Spyder:
So what y'all niggas got?

21:51.249 --> 21:52.624
Is it bangin'?

21:52.707 --> 21:53.957
Hey, K, go ahead

21:54.040 --> 21:55.666
play him that track
we worked on.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.332
( flips switch )

21:57.415 --> 21:58.915
Hey, you know
who got titties?

21:58.998 --> 22:01.666
- Viola Davis.
- Here we go.

22:01.749 --> 22:04.749
( Daniel's original
instrumental track playing )

22:16.290 --> 22:18.332
Whoo! That's hot.

22:21.666 --> 22:22.707
( turns music off )

22:22.791 --> 22:25.374
Yeah, you know,
we, uh... ( laughs )

22:25.457 --> 22:27.957
we actually have
another version, too,
though.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.499
Right?

22:34.457 --> 22:36.457
( sighs )

22:38.040 --> 22:40.915
( Khalil's mix plays )

22:51.123 --> 22:53.290
Oh. Damn, that shit hot, too.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.082

22:56.165 --> 22:57.457
Spyder:
Man, I don't know.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.415
I like the rock shit
in the first one,

22:59.499 --> 23:01.832
but the drums is bangin'
on the second.

23:01.915 --> 23:03.082
I don't know.

23:03.165 --> 23:05.290
Hey, what you think?

23:06.707 --> 23:08.998
Nigga, are you watching
"This Is Us"?

23:09.082 --> 23:10.624
( laughs )

23:10.707 --> 23:14.249
( sighs ) Yeah, bro,
I don't know. It's tough.

23:14.332 --> 23:15.915
Khalil:
You know what, though?

23:15.998 --> 23:18.666
Don't even trip, my nigga.
I got some other shit.

23:18.749 --> 23:20.332
Spyder:

- Yes, I see him.
- 'Bout time.

23:38.123 --> 23:39.290

23:39.374 --> 23:41.123

and for the lady,

23:45.165 --> 23:46.957
- Thank you.
- Daniel: Thank you.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.791
You notice
the heavy emphasis
he put on "Asian"?

23:49.873 --> 23:52.332
Hmm. That was rude.
I don't know why.

23:52.415 --> 23:54.499
You see that?
They got here after us

23:54.582 --> 23:56.040

got they entrees.

No, it's a mirror.

24:15.791 --> 24:19.123
- OK, OK, OK.
- Thank you.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.123
Anyway, I just wanted
to take you out

24:21.207 --> 24:24.165
to say thank you
for everything you've done,

24:24.249 --> 24:26.374
for letting me
stay with you...

24:26.457 --> 24:28.499
Yeah. Of course.

24:28.582 --> 24:31.415
And  I wanted to let you know

24:31.499 --> 24:34.332
that I took
the property manager job.

24:34.415 --> 24:36.249
So I'm movin' out.

24:37.374 --> 24:40.541
Oh. Uh... cool.

24:42.374 --> 24:45.832
Yeah, I just thought
it would be good
for both of us.

24:45.915 --> 24:50.499
That way we have our own space
while we... figure this out.

24:50.582 --> 24:52.707
If that's what you want.

24:53.957 --> 24:56.040
OK, what's goin' on?

24:56.123 --> 24:59.082
I feel like you've been upset
all night. Is it me?

25:01.123 --> 25:03.332
It's just some shit
with Khalil.

25:03.415 --> 25:06.040
What happened?

25:06.123 --> 25:08.541
He got mad I played
my version of the track
for Spyder,

25:08.624 --> 25:10.873
so it's whatever,
it's whatever,
it's whatever.

25:10.957 --> 25:12.207
( scoffs )

25:12.290 --> 25:15.415
Why would you do that
when he knows what Spyder likes?

25:15.499 --> 25:18.457
'Cause it's my music.

25:18.541 --> 25:21.123
So does that mean
you're not gonna
work together anymore?

25:21.207 --> 25:23.332
I mean, it is what it is.

25:23.415 --> 25:25.040
Really?

25:25.123 --> 25:27.207
But that was
a good opportunity.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.624
Maybe you should...
apologize.

25:29.707 --> 25:31.666
( laughs )

25:31.749 --> 25:33.290
What?

25:33.374 --> 25:35.207
Uhh.

25:35.290 --> 25:38.624
I just think it's funny
you  givin'  me  career advice.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.749
What does that mean?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.374
I mean, you don't
really know what it's like

25:45.457 --> 25:47.624
to really care
about what you do, Issa.

25:47.707 --> 25:48.832
I do care about--

is all over the place.

for these drinks.
Everything good?

26:07.624 --> 26:09.332
