[bacon sizzles]

00:05.614 --> 00:09.052
[blender whirrs]

00:09.096 --> 00:12.099
<i>â™ª</i>

00:12.142 --> 00:13.230
Hey, hey, hey!

00:13.274 --> 00:15.406
Stop that. Stop it!

00:15.450 --> 00:17.495
What are y'all doing, man?
It's 3:00 in the morning!

00:17.539 --> 00:20.063
You can't be fryin'
and blendin' and what-not-in'.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.022
My bad, dog.
We try to keep it down.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.067
This is Lisa.
- Hey.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.677
I'm sorry too
but he just had to try

00:25.721 --> 00:27.679
my famous tequila smoothie.
- Mm-hmm.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.465
And did y'all have to try
my special maple glaze bacon

00:30.508 --> 00:31.901
from the back
of the freezer too?

00:31.944 --> 00:34.991
Kenan, this energy
is not very "impromptu vous."

00:35.035 --> 00:36.340
"Impromptu vous?"

00:36.384 --> 00:37.646
What, are we speaking
French now?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.256
What's French
for stop scratching up

00:39.300 --> 00:40.953
my Teflon pan with that fork?

00:40.997 --> 00:44.261
Nah, man, "Impromptu Vous"
is the app we met on.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.916
I hit her up at 11:00
and went to a Creole spot.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.570
Then a strip escape room.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.354
And we escaped.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.052
Came back here
for some breakfast

00:52.095 --> 00:54.402
and some sex.
Sexfast, if you will.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.360
- Y'all did all that tonight?
- Yeah, it's a Saturday night

00:56.404 --> 00:57.361
on "Impromptu Vous,"

00:57.405 --> 00:58.884
y'know what I mean?
- Hm.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.538
- What'd you get into?
- You don't have to answer that

01:00.582 --> 01:02.584
if you don't want to.
- Who me? Oh, well,

01:02.627 --> 01:04.498
I swept out the garage.
That was a lot of fun.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.979
And then my littlest one,
Birdie, she caught the hiccups

01:07.023 --> 01:09.199
so I tried to scare them
out of her for like four hours.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.331
My goodness.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.375
And then I went to bed

01:11.419 --> 01:12.376
and caught up on my "Datelines"

01:12.420 --> 01:13.769
and "Nightlines"
and "Frontlines."

01:13.812 --> 01:15.423
Pretty much all my lines.
- Please go to bed.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.555
Yeah, you right. Goodnight.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.774
- He looked tired.
- You know what?

01:18.817 --> 01:20.123
I'ma leave y'all some bacon.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.342
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to break up your sexfast.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.343
I'm a really nice guy.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.387
It's just that this bacon

01:23.431 --> 01:24.997
is like $50 a strip, you know?

01:25.041 --> 01:26.390
I import it from Canada.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.696
And it's just
a lot of shipping costs

01:27.739 --> 01:29.393
and tariff fees
and stuff like that.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.395
But you know,
I'll put people over money

01:31.439 --> 01:32.396
any day of the week.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.615
- Kenan!
- Goodnight.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.617
Kenan, Kenan!

01:35.660 --> 01:38.098
Da-da-daddy.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.447
- That's me!
- Kenan

01:39.490 --> 01:40.796
Okay!

01:41.275 --> 01:43.277
For tomorrow's school lunch.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.235
Crab legs and olives? Birdie.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.715
Don't judge,
I like what I like.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.804
Yeah, man, she's trying
to get her carne swerve on.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.588
Well, Aubrey, can you please
help me with her?

01:50.632 --> 01:53.113
You know what would help
with all of this?

01:53.156 --> 01:55.289
A shopping list.
- She's not wrong.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.900
[laughing] Kids.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.685
They see something,
they just gotta have it.

02:00.729 --> 02:01.947
Ooh-ah!

02:01.991 --> 02:03.645
Cotton candy grapes.

02:03.688 --> 02:04.820
Mm-mm--

02:04.863 --> 02:06.909
mmm.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.780
Oh, man. That's amazing.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.955
So you're not gonna
wash them off or nothing?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.480
They've been sprayed.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.569
Hey. Can I talk to you
about this morning?

02:14.612 --> 02:16.353
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that, man.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.659
I didn't mean to leave
that mess.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.313
I feel wrong asking
Lisa to help me clean up.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.749
You know I'm a freak,
but I'm a feminist.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.534
- Not that. Not that.
- Okay.

02:23.578 --> 02:26.668
I was thinking like,
maybe I deserve a little fun.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.192
So, I might be
ready to get on that app

02:29.236 --> 02:31.325
and "Impromptu Vous" too.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.414
Ooh, well, well, well!

02:33.457 --> 02:36.286
Welcome to the booty dome!
- Keep your voice down.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.201
Why would you want
the profile of somebody

02:38.245 --> 02:39.333
that tells you
everything about 'em

02:39.376 --> 02:40.638
before you even
go out with them?

02:40.682 --> 02:42.205
Uh, so you know
what you're getting into,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.250
like a movie trailer?

02:43.293 --> 02:44.816
Where's the fun in that?

02:44.860 --> 02:48.733
You know what I say?
Just enjoy the ride.

02:48.777 --> 02:52.781
Sir, you can't just eat
the produce.

02:52.824 --> 02:56.219
Uh, real life, one.
The ride, zero.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.612
You know now I understand

02:57.655 --> 03:00.267
why those grapes
are so amazing.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.573
They've been
touched by an angel.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.488
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.229
That ain't gonna work.
Ain't gonna work.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.013
Try one, I dare you.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.799
If I'm wrong, I'll buy
every grape in the store.

03:10.842 --> 03:14.629
- He ain't got no job.
- He don't.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.153
What?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.329
- Oh, that's good.
- Right, you see?

03:19.373 --> 03:21.984
Now, listen, I know
of a little Greek place

03:22.027 --> 03:25.335
that serves an even better
grape and feta salad.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.858
And I'd like to take you there.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.513
Uh, Gina.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.559
Okay. Okay, here.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.821
Yeah, just write
your number down here.

03:32.864 --> 03:35.127
- He closed, he closed.
- Get outta--

03:35.171 --> 03:36.433
- Awesome.
- Call me.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.000
- I'll call ya.
- Oh, uh, what is your name?

03:38.043 --> 03:41.656
- Rick.
- Rick, okay.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.701
Gina.

03:43.745 --> 03:44.920
I don't know a thing about her.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.052
But I know it's gonna be
a hell of a ride.

03:47.096 --> 03:50.404
Well, look at you,
the smoothest cat in produce.

03:52.493 --> 03:55.409
- Give it a go Kenan.
- Oh, yeah, you got this.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.454
- Yeah.
- Yeah, kiss that.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.804
I think I shall.
Check this out.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.458
Invite her to
the booty dome, playa.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.731
Sir, you cannot do that.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.342
Oh, yeah? Would it change
your mind

04:15.385 --> 04:17.952
if I offered
to share some with you?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.172
Security!

04:20.216 --> 04:21.348
No, Rick said that I--

04:21.391 --> 04:22.610
where the hell is Rick?

04:22.653 --> 04:24.438
My own brother? I'm sorry.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.091
It's All right security!
You ain't got--

04:26.135 --> 04:28.180
oh, he runnin'.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.747
How about a sports segment

04:29.791 --> 04:33.751
about injuries called
"ATL's Greatest ACLs."

04:33.795 --> 04:36.580
Ooh, even the name
makes me tingle in places.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.321
Okay, Pam,
I keep telling you

04:38.365 --> 04:40.236
that we can't base
our programming decisions

04:40.280 --> 04:41.933
off your lady tingles.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.067
Well, they picked the last
three Super Bowl winners.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.242
Guys.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.809
The worst possible thing

04:47.852 --> 04:50.899
you could ever imagine
happened.

04:50.942 --> 04:54.381
[car alarm blaring]

04:57.384 --> 04:58.994
[camera snaps]
- Got it!

04:59.037 --> 05:00.517
[screams]

05:00.561 --> 05:03.085
Morning, Miss Tami.
Apologies for getting ya.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.913
You have a swell day now.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.481
David! Call my lawyer!

05:07.524 --> 05:09.396
Oh!
I thought you were gonna say

05:09.439 --> 05:11.136
somebody was checking
browser histories.

05:11.180 --> 05:14.792
Oh, my God, you got gotcha-ed
by that tabloid parasite Brett.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.186
Yes, he got a picture
of my face.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.927
My un-made-up face.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.669
People love pictures
of women with no makeup.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.889
And by people, I mean Pam.
I am one of those people.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.456
Pam.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.545
Once he posts those photos
I'll be a joke.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.982
I mean, everything I've worked
so hard for will be gone.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.767
I am so sick
of this double standard

05:32.810 --> 05:34.986
that women live with
every single day.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.380
It's the 21st century
and we still have to cater

05:37.424 --> 05:39.339
to this unrealistic
standard of beauty

05:39.382 --> 05:41.297
that keeps women bound in Spanx

05:41.341 --> 05:43.430
and makeup and six inch heels.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.649
- Yeah!
- Both my baby toes are dead.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.129
And they are not coming back

05:47.172 --> 05:48.783
unless you get one of them
Jesus toes.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.175
So you know
what we gotta do?

05:50.219 --> 05:51.176
Change the system?

05:51.220 --> 05:52.439
Nope, that'll never happen.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.355
We are gonna pay
to get those pictures back.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.399
Oh, thank God.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.705
Yep, it's what
Kenan makes me do

05:57.748 --> 05:59.533
every time Brett
catches him acting sloppy.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.317
Wake up, Kenan!

06:01.361 --> 06:02.753
[camera snaps]

06:02.797 --> 06:05.103
- Ahh.
- Hey, Kenan!

06:05.147 --> 06:07.758
I said I would pay
for the chicken, that's my bad.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.370
And Kenan's weak-ass bladder
cost me double.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.762
That dumpster
was behind a school!

06:11.806 --> 06:13.721
What?

06:15.331 --> 06:16.767
No. No.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.421
- What about this?
- No.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.988
- Okay, how 'bout that one?
- Hell no.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.164
- Aight, check that one out.
- Oh, no.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.340
Come on, man.
People like to see me in suits.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.429
This is about showing people
your fun side, dog.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.517
Like, look at this, man.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.649
Look at this picture
right there.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.042
That says, "Oh, he's fun, sexy

06:31.086 --> 06:32.435
and way too comfortable
with his body."

06:32.479 --> 06:33.697
Okay?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.003
Let's just skip
to the profile, man.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.396
Type this.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.442
"I'm a 38-year-old
single zaddy.

06:39.486 --> 06:43.794
I ain't here for a long time
but I'm here for a good time."

06:43.838 --> 06:45.230
Zaddy.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.668
Z-A-D-D--

06:47.711 --> 06:50.932
why are you not typing?
Are your thumbs broke?

06:50.975 --> 06:51.976
I'm sorry, man.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.630
I don't want that
on my profile.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.327
I don't want
to present myself like that.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.329
Are you sure because
this is how it's done, fam.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.766
You said you wanted this.
- I do.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.420
But I don't want
these women out there

07:00.463 --> 07:02.465
thinking I'm like you.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.901
What up, nerds?

07:03.945 --> 07:06.034
Hey, what's up, Big Rick!
Where you headed to?

07:06.077 --> 07:08.732
Having dinner with Gina.
In the real world.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.473
Okay, you know
these online dates

07:10.517 --> 07:12.432
don't happen in the phone,
right?

07:12.475 --> 07:14.738
- Really?
- Hey, uh...

07:14.782 --> 07:16.131
What you mean
when you said you don't want

07:16.174 --> 07:18.786
people to think you like me?
- Oh, nothing, man.

07:18.829 --> 07:19.917
You know, I'm just, you know,

07:19.961 --> 07:21.745
I'm more like
a responsible father

07:21.789 --> 07:23.747
that people look up to
in the community, you know?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.096
Like a--I'm like a deacon.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.403
Kind of, and you're like a--
- Satan?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.752
No. No, man,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.319
I'm just saying like,
you're free.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.408
That's what it is.
You like wild and reckless,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.975
you don't have
no responsibilities.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.368
So nobody looks up to you
because, you know, you Gary.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.674
Oh.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.981
I'm just gonna get some gum,

07:40.024 --> 07:41.504
condoms. I'm out.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.985
All right, have a good night
Big Rick!

07:44.028 --> 07:45.247
All right, come on, man,
let's get back to my profile.

07:45.290 --> 07:48.119
Oh, you got this, deacon.
You got this.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.339
Y'all go ahead,
wing it from the soul, brother.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.123
Okay.
[clears throat]

07:52.167 --> 07:53.603
Hello, ladies.

07:53.647 --> 07:57.955
38-year-old single girl dad.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.174
Very blessed.

07:59.217 --> 08:02.917
Looking for a night
of fun and respect.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.222
No, no.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.834
Mutual respect.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.879
That is the sexiest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.055
You know what? Let's go ahead
and search for some matches

08:11.099 --> 08:13.928
around the area,
see what pops up.

08:15.843 --> 08:19.542
Oh. Ooh, matches already.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
Come on now.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.763
Here we go, phone.
- It's not an eight ball.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.416
Hey, there you go.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.418
One for your boy, I knew it
was coming through.

08:26.462 --> 08:27.507
Look at--oh.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.464
No, that's just a reminder

08:28.508 --> 08:30.814
to record "Frontline."

08:35.123 --> 08:36.515
Okay.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.039
Okay, this is nice.
This is nice, man.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.129
Thanks for doing this, man,
you know.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.174
A double date kind of makes it
a little easier.

08:43.217 --> 08:45.873
Oh, it's all good, man.
This is my world, you know.

08:45.916 --> 08:50.094
I'm trying not to get too
reckless and ruin it for you.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.096
- Gary.
- Oh, Janay.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.187
Ooh, look at you.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.581
Seems like that algorithm
working well

08:58.625 --> 09:00.017
for your brother, right?

09:00.061 --> 09:01.802
Yep, she looks
like a very nice match.

09:01.845 --> 09:02.933
For you.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.326
Yes.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.894
I'm sure my match
is in here somewhere.

09:06.937 --> 09:09.026
Hey.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.854
Are you Ashley?
- Ashley.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.203
Nice to meet you, I'm Kenan.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.640
R--right.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.337
I love your...smock?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.339
Ah, it's a frock.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.514
I'm glad we matched.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.038
You're the sweetest man
in morning news.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.605
Thank you very much.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.173
So, why don't you
catch me up on Ashley?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.523
Well I'm the principal
at St. John's Elementary.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.177
I take care of my grandmother

09:29.220 --> 09:31.005
and I foster
skittish chihuahuas.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.833
I've got a pic.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.312
Hey, that's a...

09:34.356 --> 09:35.836
that's a lot of teeth.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.838
You know, why don't we just
get y'all some drinks?

09:37.881 --> 09:39.230
Just water for me.

09:39.274 --> 09:42.320
Or as I call it,
Earth's cocktail.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.322
Yeah.
That's a fun way to talk.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.063
- Uh-huh.
- Real fun.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.109
I guess I don't
need a drink either.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.808
Uhh, how's that boring-ass
profile treating you, deacon?

09:51.852 --> 09:53.854
Hey, man, we still trying
to get to know each other.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.116
Okay.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.597
Question.
What the hell is that?

09:57.640 --> 10:02.210
Is she praying
over the peanuts?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.994
Yeah. I like this.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.605
This is going well.
- Yeah?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.304
[snickers]

10:12.699 --> 10:14.265
Hello, Brett.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.658
Well, I'll be!

10:15.702 --> 10:19.053
It's the lovely ladies
of "Wake Up With Kenan."

10:19.096 --> 10:20.402
Okay.

10:20.445 --> 10:23.057
Don't worry, that one's
just for my personals.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.017
Brett. I have a right
to look amazing in my photos.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.540
And to privacy.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.542
- Sure, sure.
- Hand them over

10:30.586 --> 10:33.589
or I'm gonna kick you
in your tingly places.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.594
I'm sure we can settle this
like civilized human beings.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.815
I'll kill the photos
for $20,000

10:41.858 --> 10:44.252
and a shot of some of y'alls
feet meat.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.906
Again, just for my personals.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.951
20 grand? For her?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.779
That's like Kelly Ripa money.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.912
Yeah, I've never paid
2,000 For Kenan.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.654
Well, the market wants
what the market wants

10:54.697 --> 10:57.744
and right now the market wants
white ladies looking terrible.

10:57.787 --> 11:01.269
We'll give you 3,000 but
no meat from any of our feet.

11:02.183 --> 11:06.753
Mm, 15,000 or the photos
will go live tomorrow.

11:06.796 --> 11:07.928
Okay, there's no way--

11:07.971 --> 11:10.104
- I'll pay it.
- What?

11:10.147 --> 11:11.932
Tami, are you sure?

11:11.975 --> 11:13.411
Yeah. I am.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.630
You'll have it tomorrow.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.546
Well, I appreciate all y'all.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.809
You ladies have
a real nice night.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.812
An awful human being.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.335
Great manners though.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.902
<i>I wanna know, what is this?</i>

11:28.862 --> 11:30.907
Mmm.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.213
And you speak Greek.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.650
This night
is full of surprises.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.608
Like that kitchen fire
at the restaurant.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.132
Yeah, I still don't know why
they make

11:38.175 --> 11:40.047
those chef hats so flammable.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.744
Yeah.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.399
But, hey,
you and I are gonna end up

11:44.442 --> 11:45.879
right where
we're supposed to be.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.973
[door creaks]

11:53.016 --> 11:54.322
- Gina?
- Oh.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.237
What the hell is this?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.499
Any chance he's your brother?

11:57.542 --> 11:59.109
Oh, no, it's my husband.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.198
Who's not the only one
who can have meaningless sex

12:01.242 --> 12:03.113
with randos. Sorry.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.724
Hi, I'm Rick.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.161
I'm gonna
knock your teeth in.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.728
Wait, wait, wait.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.689
Uh-oh,
secret shots at the bar.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
That's not
the Kenan from the profile.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.258
No, no, no.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.782
They just here to help me
have a great night, you know.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.088
I've never been out
with a principal before.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.350
It's cool.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.699
Oh, yeah?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.614
Are you enjoying how
she's measuring how far

12:25.657 --> 12:27.485
my date's shorts are
from her knees right now?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.966
Yeah.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.576
I love that.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.102
You know, I also loved when
she made me tuck in my shirt.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.844
And I love all 150
creepy-ass photos of her dog.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.628
- Oh, that's fun.
- And you know I loved

12:39.671 --> 12:41.325
when she told the DJ to turn
the music down

12:41.369 --> 12:43.545
so we could all hear
how awful she is.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.938
You might wanna chill, fam.

12:44.981 --> 12:48.028
Your date is great
and mine sucks.

12:48.071 --> 12:51.248
She really, really sucks, man.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.077
At least I am who I say I am.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.992
Hey, girl!

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
Look at you.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
Still loving that
frock by the way.

12:59.517 --> 13:00.997
You are fake.

13:01.041 --> 13:05.219
Your show should be called
"Fake Up with Kenan."

13:05.262 --> 13:06.524
What?
Now, Ashley, don't leave.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.917
I'm sorry. I'm a good guy.

13:07.961 --> 13:11.573
I just maybe had too many
of the Earth's cocktails.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.794
There goes your congregation,
deacon.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.712
Okay, now help me decide
which of my children

13:20.756 --> 13:22.366
gets to go to college.
I'm leaning towards Braden.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.368
Richard's sweet
but he's kind of a dumb-dumb.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.413
Wait a minute.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.544
You're blowing up
your kids' future

13:26.588 --> 13:27.807
for these pictures?

13:27.850 --> 13:28.851
Where'd you think
I was gonna get it?

13:28.895 --> 13:29.983
No offense but I thought

13:30.026 --> 13:31.506
you'd just
drive outside Atlanta

13:31.549 --> 13:33.551
to some rundown plantation.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.423
Great Grammy on the veranda
would be like,

13:35.466 --> 13:37.425
"It's under the floorboards,
Tami."

13:37.468 --> 13:38.687
Yeah, right.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.906
Most of my people's homes
had wheels.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.342
Oh, that's cool.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.213
Well, look, you can't
pay Brett all that money.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.780
You don't understand.
I haven't been seen

13:44.824 --> 13:45.868
without makeup
since I could walk.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.087
I'm a pageant kid.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.305
both: Oh.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.874
You were a little
Tami Boo Boo.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.137
Every day it was
"Don't gain weight, Tami."

13:54.181 --> 13:56.270
"Don't forget to put in
your fake teeth, Tami."

13:56.313 --> 13:58.533
"Don't tell anybody
you have chickenpox, Tami."

13:58.576 --> 14:02.015
To win you have to be pretty
and perfect.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.974
And those photos are not.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.368
I don't have a choice.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.152
Let me tell you
a little story, Tami.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.546
When I hurt my knee
and pro tennis was out,

14:11.589 --> 14:15.724
I said, "Pam,
you're a sparkling personality.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.030
Try broadcasting."

14:17.073 --> 14:19.510
But everyone was like,
"Put on a dress.

14:19.554 --> 14:23.384
You got great legs, get your
wicked boobs out there."

14:23.427 --> 14:26.822
But I wanted the world
to see the real me.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.476
Eventually "Wake Up with Kenan"
happened

14:28.519 --> 14:30.957
and I became
America's sweetheart.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.089
- You did that.
- Yeah.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.440
And if it hadn't happened,
then what?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.094
Well at least I could
live with myself

14:38.138 --> 14:41.924
because I made the right choice
for me, not them.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.753
I'm gonna always choose Pam

14:44.796 --> 14:48.104
'cause Pam is freakin' great!

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
- Hm.
- Yeah.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.108
You're right,
Pam is freakin' great.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.981
And so is Mika!
Mika's friggin' great too.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.373
And you know what?
- That's right.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.679
- This is happening.
- What?

14:57.722 --> 14:58.985
Bam, bam!

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
- Damn!
- Oh, dear God.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.511
That's right.
Take it all in, y'all.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.948
This is all Mika, baby!

15:05.992 --> 15:07.167
This is a restaurant.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.910
Please put your shoes back on
or leave.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.477
Well, you know what?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.131
I choose me.

15:15.175 --> 15:18.656
And Tami,
you should choose you too.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.006
Goodnight, ladies.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.314
Do her toes
even touch the ground?

15:24.358 --> 15:25.141
[shudders]

15:25.185 --> 15:27.056
Man, you were wrong.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.102
"Impromptu" does not know
how to match people.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.234
When you put up
that boring-ass profile,

15:31.278 --> 15:33.715
you got a boring-ass principal,
that's the science.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.195
I'ma go get us
some more rounds.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.719
Don't blame "Impromptu Vous."

15:37.762 --> 15:39.634
For this? Ha!

15:39.677 --> 15:40.765
Don't beat yourself up.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.680
You were more than
sweet to her.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.944
I mean, before you
cussed her out at the bar.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.858
Oh, no, no.
I didn't cuss now.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.208
My rants are always clean.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.861
I'm like the Sinbad
of hurting feelings.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.473
[laughs]

15:52.516 --> 15:54.605
Well, I guess all it took
was getting dumped

15:54.649 --> 15:58.131
and a couple of drinks
for someone to loosen up.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.220
I don't know. Maybe.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.048
If we would have matched up,

16:02.091 --> 16:03.179
I definitely
would have swiped right.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.920
[Saweetie's "Tap In" plays]

16:04.964 --> 16:06.704
Oh! Oh, this is my song!

16:06.748 --> 16:08.663
Come dance with me.
- I'm--nah--I'm okay.

16:08.706 --> 16:09.794
Gary'll be right back.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.361
You know you
want to dance with me!

16:11.405 --> 16:12.841
- No, no, no--
- Come dance with me.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.147
All right,
I guess I'm dancing.

16:14.190 --> 16:18.281
Whoa, okay, if you insist.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.067
Oh, I can't fight the music.
- Yes, no one can.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.720
Oh, you son of a bitch!

16:22.764 --> 16:24.896
[grunts]

16:24.940 --> 16:26.724
Oh, I was carrying
all the tension

16:26.768 --> 16:28.378
in my lower back.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.032
Yeah, that's all that guilt

16:30.076 --> 16:31.468
from the way you've been
treating Gina.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.904
You're right.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.384
- And Gina?
- Yes.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.039
You gotta stop playing
games with handsome randos.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.128
We're people too.
- I get that now.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.303
Guys, you're gonna
have some highs,

16:40.347 --> 16:42.175
you're gonna have some lows.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.438
But just be good to each other.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.744
And?
both: Enjoy the ride.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.659
There we go, we got it.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.445
Oh! And to think
I was gonna kick your ass.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.448
And to think I was gonna
make sweet love to your wife.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.753
[cackles]

16:55.797 --> 16:57.233
Whoa!

16:57.277 --> 17:00.106
- Ohh.
- Oh.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.461
<i>â™ª</i>

17:18.906 --> 17:21.779
Kenan. What the holy hell?

17:21.823 --> 17:23.085
It's not what it looks like.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.131
Yes, it is.
Don't front for him.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.480
You calling me Satan

17:26.522 --> 17:28.743
and you out here
freaking my date.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.614
Well, technically
you called yourself Satan.

17:30.658 --> 17:33.878
- Shut up, Kenan!
- Hey, Gary, man, I'm sorry.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.097
I don't know what happened,

17:35.141 --> 17:36.794
but maybe we can talk
about this at home?

17:36.838 --> 17:39.449
I mean, we don't really want
to make a scene right?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.321
Yes, we do.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.192
You want everybody
to think that you're perfect,

17:43.236 --> 17:44.628
but you're not perfect.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.717
Kenan Williams
ain't perfect, y'all.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.111
As a matter of fact,
when he does laundry,

17:49.155 --> 17:51.287
he mixes his dish towels
with his underwear

17:51.331 --> 17:53.289
so his underwear
smells like wet eggs

17:53.333 --> 17:55.291
and his dish towel
smells like booty.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.163
Gary, man, I'm warning you.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.425
Bring it down.

17:58.468 --> 18:01.384
I ain't bringing down
nothing.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.473
Well, don't make me
make you bring it down.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.648
Oh, come on, fight already.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.128
Oh, no,
I ain't gon' fight my own--

18:06.172 --> 18:07.738
- Ah!
- Oh!

18:07.782 --> 18:09.827
- Let's fight! Let's fight!
- Get off--get off!

18:09.871 --> 18:14.876
No!

18:14.919 --> 18:16.312
- Get off of me!
- No!

18:16.356 --> 18:17.574
You smell like dish towels!

18:17.618 --> 18:20.360
[muffled cries]

18:25.147 --> 18:27.062
Oh, hey, I'm sorry
about the nose blood

18:27.106 --> 18:28.150
I got in your backseat there.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.238
Can you still
give me five stars?

18:29.282 --> 18:30.631
I'm definitely gonna
give you five stars.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.806
Okay, he's leaving, All right.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.199
What you want five stars for?

18:33.242 --> 18:35.026
Ruining everybody's night?

18:35.070 --> 18:36.898
Hey, look, man.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.553
I'm sorry once again
for the disrespectful twerk.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.684
But you ain't have
to call me out in front

18:40.728 --> 18:42.208
of everybody like
that either though.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.774
I'm tired of you acting
like you better than me, man.

18:43.818 --> 18:47.169
You all, "Oh, I'm perfect Kenan
and you, you just Gary."

18:47.213 --> 18:48.605
I'm sorry, man.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.172
Me saying that
and making that profile,

18:50.216 --> 18:51.478
yeah, I was, I was tripping.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.001
About what?

18:53.044 --> 18:55.351
Because I gotta be
Daddy Kenan.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.049
And PTA Kenan,
and "Wake Up with Kenan" Kenan.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.877
I mean, I don't ever
get to be just

18:59.921 --> 19:01.488
"freakin' on the dance floor
Kenan"

19:01.531 --> 19:03.011
or "freakin'
in the bedroom Kenan."

19:03.054 --> 19:04.317
Why not?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.014
Where else would you freak?

19:06.057 --> 19:07.711
Well, I mean.
What will people think?

19:07.755 --> 19:09.974
Who cares
what people think, man.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.325
Like, why you put so much
pressure on yourself?

19:12.368 --> 19:13.761
Dude, all of us who love you

19:13.804 --> 19:17.982
are gonna love you
any which way you are.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.245
Aight?

19:19.288 --> 19:21.682
- Aight.
- Aight.

19:21.725 --> 19:22.900
Sorry again
about that beat down.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.859
Psh! What are you
talking about, man?

19:24.902 --> 19:26.165
I wrestled you sloppily, bro.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
I don't know, man,
your boy got 'em hard.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.690
You know, man,
I ain't easy to get down.

19:29.733 --> 19:30.952
[animal shrieking]
- Whoa! Street cat!

19:30.995 --> 19:32.606
Okay!
- What is that--a bat?!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.437
Yeah, my bad again, man.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.352
Me too, man, for real.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.701
Damn, Rick.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.529
Somebody didn't enjoy
the ride tonight, huh?

19:42.572 --> 19:45.358
Well, actually
the ride's not over.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.359
Hi.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.751
Oh, snap.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.927
- Hi.
- You got company.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.625
And a first responder?

19:51.668 --> 19:53.409
Uh, thank you
for your service.

19:53.453 --> 19:54.758
Goodnight, nerds.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.847
- Right away?
- All right, Ricky Boy!

19:56.891 --> 19:58.849
No, really. Goodnight.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.155
<i>Thank you, Charlene.</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:01.939
Surprisingly, your rendition
of "Uptown Funk"

20:01.983 --> 20:03.550
did not cure my hangover.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.899
[bell rings]

20:04.942 --> 20:07.467
Okay, that's enough
of the bells, Charlene!

20:07.510 --> 20:09.251
All right, thank you very much.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.339
Okay, up next,

20:10.383 --> 20:12.254
Tami is doing
a very special thing

20:12.298 --> 20:16.127
that I'm just finding out about
while I'm reading this, now.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.955
Uh, Tami?

20:17.999 --> 20:21.089
So yesterday,
some very unflattering photos

20:21.132 --> 20:26.616
were taken of me and I was
scared of them going public.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.618
But some friends
helped me realize

20:28.662 --> 20:31.839
I don't need to be scared.

20:31.882 --> 20:35.146
Those photos will
be posted later today.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.931
But...

20:36.974 --> 20:41.370
I wanted to give you...

20:41.414 --> 20:43.111
the exclusive first.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.722
I'm tired of pretending to be
perfect all the time.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.725
[exhales]

20:48.769 --> 20:51.685
This is me, Tami.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.382
The real Tami.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.298
- Whoo! We love you, Tami!
- That's it!

20:56.342 --> 20:59.170
I'd still go out with you.
I would.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.999
And if you're tired
of pretending too, join me.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.610
Join me!

21:03.653 --> 21:05.829
- Oh!
- Way to go, Jack, yes!

21:05.873 --> 21:07.440
Okay, who's next?

21:07.483 --> 21:08.919
Hoo-ah! Oh, man.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.226
Whoo, boy, boy, boy,
that feels much better.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.272
- Yeah, Kenan!
- Come on, man.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.882
Let your insecurity fly.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.405
- Hell no, I'm good.
- We love you.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.278
- Y'all tripping.
- Right.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.238
<i>My back doctor suggested this.</i>
