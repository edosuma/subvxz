WEBVTT

00:01.679 --> 00:04.846
I'm pregnant.
You're going to be a father.

00:04.849 --> 00:06.717
I promised myself
that this disease

00:06.719 --> 00:08.387
would die with me.

00:08.389 --> 00:10.824
Sometimes promises
have to be broken.

00:10.826 --> 00:14.030
Maybe after the wedding,
I shouldn't stay in London,

00:14.032 --> 00:17.467
because maybe I could kiss
another patient.

00:17.469 --> 00:18.603
Divya.

00:18.605 --> 00:21.841
Miss Newberg and I
are moving in together.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.644
You invested in companies
that didn't exist.

00:23.646 --> 00:24.812
Okay, let's start there.

00:24.814 --> 00:26.113
Allegedly didn't exist.

00:26.115 --> 00:27.815
Yeah,
you're going to jail, dad.

00:27.817 --> 00:29.517
If you desire for your father

00:29.519 --> 00:31.785
to have a less stressful
environment,

00:31.787 --> 00:33.587
I can make those arrangements.

00:33.589 --> 00:35.656
I was just thinking,
I mean, it's been a while.

00:35.658 --> 00:37.391
Maybe we should get together.

00:37.393 --> 00:40.227
I'd like that.

00:40.229 --> 00:41.695
Marisa's not moving out, huh?

00:41.697 --> 00:43.797
No.
Looks like we are.

00:58.247 --> 01:00.884
What kind of man kicks two
wonderful kids out of his house?

01:00.886 --> 01:03.520
- We're not kids anymore, dad.
- You are to me.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.858
And wherever I have a home,
you'll always have one too.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.693
You mean wherever
miss Newberg has a home?

01:08.695 --> 01:10.563
- Yeah.
- I'm just kidding, pop.

01:10.565 --> 01:12.266
Thanks for taking us in
off the streets.

01:12.268 --> 01:13.534
Yeah, we wouldn't last long

01:13.536 --> 01:15.036
out on the rough beaches
of southampton.

01:15.038 --> 01:18.273
Oh, and when I join
miss Newberg in Manhattan,

01:18.275 --> 01:21.176
her place is all yours
until next summer.

01:21.178 --> 01:22.745
What?
That's awesome.

01:22.747 --> 01:25.716
Uh, given what
we're about to walk into,

01:25.718 --> 01:28.820
you might want to hold off
on relocating to fifth Avenue.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.723
Please.
It's gonna go my way.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.227
Absolutely, dad.
I know it.

01:34.229 --> 01:37.764
All right.
Well, let's go find out.

01:58.555 --> 02:00.923
Filmmaker.

02:00.925 --> 02:03.792
Documentarian.

02:03.794 --> 02:07.229
Raj, please.

02:07.231 --> 02:11.368
Hardly a way
to support a family.

02:11.370 --> 02:14.238
He doesn't do it for the money.

02:14.240 --> 02:18.743
Why not?

02:18.745 --> 02:20.612
He doesn't need to.

02:20.614 --> 02:22.648
Ah, Adam comes from money.

02:22.650 --> 02:25.852
Is that what
attracted you to him?

02:25.854 --> 02:28.021
Can we please change
the subject?

02:28.023 --> 02:30.858
Now that's passion.

02:30.860 --> 02:34.095
Listen to the music.

02:34.097 --> 02:36.598
Destiny has rhythm.

02:38.635 --> 02:41.571
And it's clear you two
are fated for each other.

02:45.176 --> 02:46.677
What are you doing?

02:46.679 --> 02:48.713
Well, we feel fated
to take a break.

02:48.715 --> 02:50.315
A break?

02:50.317 --> 02:53.685
Divya, this is tango boot camp
for your wedding.

02:53.687 --> 02:56.789
You did not hire
a world-famous choreographer

02:56.791 --> 02:58.925
to watch you take a break.

02:58.927 --> 03:01.060
So for the next two days,

03:01.062 --> 03:04.064
there are no breaks.

03:04.066 --> 03:05.532
There is only tango.

03:05.534 --> 03:09.102
Now dance.

03:14.976 --> 03:17.377
Where'd you find
this guy again?

03:17.379 --> 03:19.546
He was a patient.

03:19.548 --> 03:23.049
Earlier this summer,
he dislocated his toe.

03:23.051 --> 03:27.387
Technically, I shouldn't
have told you that.

03:27.389 --> 03:30.790
Well, add it to the list.

03:32.893 --> 03:34.894
Thanks for agreeing
to this interview, Jill.

03:34.896 --> 03:37.831
So...Ever hiked
the appalachian trail?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.432
Well, uh...

03:39.434 --> 03:42.236
There's no wrong answer,
in case you're wondering.

03:42.238 --> 03:44.671
Then, no, I haven't.

03:44.673 --> 03:47.874
Well, put it at the top
of your to-do list.

03:47.876 --> 03:49.810
I'd still be up
on the Franconia Ridge

03:49.812 --> 03:51.978
if there wasn't important work
to be done here.

03:51.980 --> 03:54.180
At your annual
m.S. Fundraiser.

03:54.182 --> 03:55.849
That is one half of my agenda.

03:55.851 --> 03:59.319
And the other half?

04:01.255 --> 04:03.490
You.

04:03.492 --> 04:05.891
I thought
this was an interview.

04:05.893 --> 04:09.161
It was.
Now it's an offer.

04:09.163 --> 04:12.331
Help me launch
a South American fleet

04:12.333 --> 04:15.234
of my mobile
medical clinics, Jill.

04:15.236 --> 04:17.503
Just like that?

04:17.505 --> 04:20.672
You've improved a hospital,
founded a community clinic,

04:20.673 --> 04:22.440
and the worst thing
I've heard about you

04:22.442 --> 04:24.910
is that you got drunk
one night recently

04:24.912 --> 04:26.411
and woke up with a tattoo?

04:26.413 --> 04:28.247
- It's just a little...
- A flower.

04:28.249 --> 04:29.649
Shoulder... I know.

04:29.651 --> 04:32.185
You do do your homework.

04:32.187 --> 04:34.955
And I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to sound skeptical.

04:34.957 --> 04:38.125
Well, I didn't say
there wasn't a catch.

04:38.127 --> 04:40.394
I need you to start Monday.

04:40.396 --> 04:43.097
That's a pretty catchy catch.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.566
Yeah, you'll be in D.C.
for a two-week orientation,

04:45.568 --> 04:47.535
then montevideo for 6 months.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.036
Montevideo?

04:49.038 --> 04:51.306
Southernmost capital city
in the americas

04:51.308 --> 04:54.075
and home of the world's
longest carnival.

04:54.077 --> 04:55.477
You'll love it.

04:55.479 --> 04:57.345
Well, I'll have
to think about that.

04:57.347 --> 04:59.980
And I'll have to look over
this agreement.

04:59.982 --> 05:02.849
I'm sure your lawyer will find
it more than reasonable.

05:02.851 --> 05:04.884
And I have to get a lawyer.

05:04.886 --> 05:07.154
Here.

05:13.994 --> 05:17.030
Well, I was gonna
walk you through it myself.

05:17.032 --> 05:20.734
Unfortunately, um, my vision
just became blurry.

05:20.736 --> 05:22.035
It happens every now and then.

05:22.037 --> 05:24.403
Can I contact
your doctor for you?

05:24.405 --> 05:27.639
The one I trust the most
is in Tokyo at the moment.

05:27.641 --> 05:30.742
Well, the one I trust the most
is much closer.

05:30.744 --> 05:34.246
I don't understand.

05:34.248 --> 05:36.948
- Which part?
- What just happened?

05:36.950 --> 05:39.818
It didn't go your way, dad...

05:39.820 --> 05:41.252
Our way.

05:41.254 --> 05:43.187
Didn't sid
make a good case in there?

05:43.189 --> 05:44.722
Not good enough, apparently.

05:44.724 --> 05:46.391
All right,
what about an appeal?

05:46.393 --> 05:47.792
I don't think
an appeal's gonna...

05:47.794 --> 05:50.295
No, no, no, I got
to figure out my next move.

05:50.297 --> 05:51.997
Dad, look at me.

05:51.999 --> 05:53.932
What?

05:53.934 --> 05:57.436
There are no moves
left to make.

05:57.438 --> 06:02.075
In 48 hours...

06:02.077 --> 06:04.712
You're going to prison.

06:41.248 --> 06:44.248
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

06:49.675 --> 06:52.277
can you tell me a little bit
about what you're experiencing?

06:52.279 --> 06:53.811
It's a flare-up

06:53.813 --> 06:55.847
of my relapsing-remitting
course of M.S....

06:55.849 --> 06:57.349
uh, blurry vision,

06:57.351 --> 06:59.050
weakness,
numbness in the limbs.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.120
I self-administer 44 micrograms
of interferon subcutaneously

07:03.122 --> 07:04.188
three times a week.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.524
Um, I also get achy joints,

07:06.526 --> 07:09.593
and I'm a little hungry.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.196
I guess you can tell me a lot
about what you're experiencing.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.431
I was diagnosed as a sophomore

07:14.433 --> 07:15.966
at the university
of new Mexico.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.135
I've lived with it a while.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.070
M.S. Diagnosis in college...

07:21.072 --> 07:22.339
That's not easy.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.075
Yeah, I wanted to drop out,

07:25.077 --> 07:26.576
but I also wanted to become

07:26.578 --> 07:29.312
the first college graduate
in my family.

07:29.314 --> 07:32.148
- So you stuck it out.
- Yeah.

07:35.586 --> 07:39.488
Prescribe her
100 milligram P.O., B.I.D.,

07:39.490 --> 07:41.189
and schedule a follow-up
in two weeks.

07:41.191 --> 07:43.325
Done...

07:43.327 --> 07:45.127
And done.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.795
And...

07:46.797 --> 07:48.164
Done.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.901
Yeah. That is it
for all old business.

07:51.903 --> 07:56.840
Thanks
for a great summer, Divya.

07:56.842 --> 07:59.610
We couldn't have done it
without you.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.449
Okay.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.517
- Okay.
- Good.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.453
Okay.

08:09.455 --> 08:10.654
- Okay.
- All right.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.988
So moving on to new business.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.090
Yep, yep, yep.
What do you got, bro?

08:14.092 --> 08:16.893
Well, first thing
on the post-Divya agenda...

08:19.195 --> 08:21.730
Surprise!

08:23.633 --> 08:24.966
That was...

08:24.968 --> 08:26.468
Cruel!

08:26.470 --> 08:28.070
But still kind of awesome.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.171
- Totally awesome.
- Yeah.

08:29.173 --> 08:31.006
Evan wrote the script.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.743
And designed the cake.

08:33.745 --> 08:37.246
And, uh, Evan has got
one more surprise for you.

08:37.249 --> 08:40.751
While Hank stays here
and holds down the fort,

08:40.753 --> 08:44.722
I will be representing Hankmed
at your wedding.

08:44.724 --> 08:45.957
Shut up!

08:47.359 --> 08:50.593
I can't believe I'm so happy
about this, but I am.

08:50.595 --> 08:52.295
Paige is gonna be
my plus-one,

08:52.297 --> 08:55.031
and we will both have
the sea bass, please.

08:55.033 --> 08:58.500
Thank you, guys.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.268
Really, for...

09:00.270 --> 09:01.769
For all of this.

09:01.771 --> 09:04.071
Divya, you may have seen
your last patient of the summer,

09:04.073 --> 09:07.641
<i>but you will always,
always be a part of Hankmed.</i>

09:07.643 --> 09:09.410
Group hug right now,

09:09.412 --> 09:10.778
<i>golden girls style.
Do it.</i>

09:10.780 --> 09:13.281
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

09:17.621 --> 09:20.089
- Hey.
- Dad.

09:20.091 --> 09:22.325
Pop?

09:31.668 --> 09:33.502
I'm worried about him.

09:33.504 --> 09:35.871
Me too.
Is he gonna be okay?

09:35.873 --> 09:37.439
Yeah,
he'll... he'll get better.

09:37.441 --> 09:38.940
In prison?

09:38.942 --> 09:40.175
A prison without fences.

09:40.177 --> 09:41.910
It's got dormitory housing,

09:41.912 --> 09:43.611
a computer library,
and shuffleboard.

09:43.613 --> 09:46.580
I just don't want to see him
waste his final hours of freedom

09:46.582 --> 09:48.416
feeling sorry for himself,
you know?

09:48.418 --> 09:49.750
I should go talk to him.

09:49.752 --> 09:52.353
Isn't prison punishment enough?

09:52.355 --> 09:53.955
I'm gonna miss you.

09:53.957 --> 09:56.657
So what do you think about Ben?

09:56.659 --> 09:58.125
Pretty remarkable.

09:58.127 --> 10:00.561
Manages to do well
and do good at the same time,

10:00.563 --> 10:02.430
takes charge of his own health,

10:02.432 --> 10:05.567
and he's a role model for people
with a very tough condition.

10:05.569 --> 10:07.469
I'm not impressed.

10:07.471 --> 10:09.838
Yeah, you know,
his motto is so simple,

10:09.840 --> 10:11.340
yet so powerful.

10:11.342 --> 10:12.975
"You are not your disease."

10:12.977 --> 10:14.543
Yeah,
he's a very inspiring guy.

10:14.545 --> 10:16.446
Which is probably why my board

10:16.448 --> 10:18.248
seems so willing to give me
a six-months leave

10:18.250 --> 10:19.516
on short notice.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.384
They're trying
to score points with him

10:21.386 --> 10:23.854
and his well-endowed
foundation.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.723
So I guess the question is...

10:26.725 --> 10:28.824
What do you think of Ben?

10:28.826 --> 10:30.826
I think he's a unique guy

10:30.828 --> 10:33.462
offering me
a unique opportunity.

10:33.464 --> 10:35.263
Okay, so why
are you having doubts?

10:35.265 --> 10:37.732
Well, I'm worried

10:37.734 --> 10:41.068
about who's gonna run
our clinic.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.469
Don't.

10:42.471 --> 10:46.239
I'm happy to clinic-sit
for you while you're away.

10:46.241 --> 10:48.141
How short's the notice?

10:49.645 --> 10:51.678
You said "short notice."

10:51.680 --> 10:53.913
How short?

10:53.915 --> 10:57.149
I'd leave in three days.

10:58.686 --> 11:01.887
That is short.
Yeah.

11:07.493 --> 11:10.028
The woman
must demand the passion,

11:10.030 --> 11:13.666
and the man must create it,
especially for a strong woman.

11:13.668 --> 11:15.100
Thank you, Niko.

11:15.102 --> 11:16.835
Listen to the music.

11:16.837 --> 11:19.337
You must burn in her fire.

11:19.339 --> 11:21.006
Prove yourself, raj.

11:21.008 --> 11:22.540
Burn in her fire?

11:25.311 --> 11:26.778
That's right.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.714
And prove yourself.

11:32.286 --> 11:34.420
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:34.422 --> 11:35.822
You do feel a little warm.

11:35.824 --> 11:37.324
Yes, from burning in your fire.

11:37.326 --> 11:40.394
Or from coming down
with a fever.

11:40.396 --> 11:43.997
Life is fever.
Love is fever.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.669
Maybe Niko's right.

11:49.671 --> 11:52.105
You tried to tell me
what you needed.

11:52.107 --> 11:53.840
I didn't listen.

11:53.842 --> 11:57.310
Raj, you shouldn't live
without passion either.

11:57.312 --> 11:59.045
Tell that to your father.

11:59.047 --> 12:00.846
He works me to within
an inch of my life

12:00.848 --> 12:04.717
six days a week.

12:04.719 --> 12:08.220
Doesn't leave much time
or energy for passion.

12:08.222 --> 12:12.993
Well, beats his plan for me...

12:12.995 --> 12:14.394
For us.

12:14.396 --> 12:16.897
Wedding, babies, more babies.

12:16.899 --> 12:19.133
Yes...

12:19.135 --> 12:21.636
That plan.

12:21.638 --> 12:24.006
I guess we're fated to it.

12:29.612 --> 12:32.080
Fate and obligation are two
very different things, raj.

12:38.121 --> 12:39.655
Nicely done.

12:39.657 --> 12:41.490
Now you are dancing the tango.

12:44.462 --> 12:47.563
Okay, Mr. "life is fever."

12:47.565 --> 12:50.500
I need to examine you,
listen to your lungs.

12:50.502 --> 12:51.768
I assure you it's nothing.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.170
I must have caught a cold
from Olga,

12:53.172 --> 12:54.672
my new protege in the Ukraine.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.107
When were you with her?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.942
Two days ago in Kiev.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.579
But now I am here, and I'm
ready to begin my vacation,

13:00.581 --> 13:03.949
as soon as I've taught you both
how to dance properly.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.218
Your health is more important.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.887
If I can tango, I'm healthy.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.323
And if you can't tango,
I will be sick.

13:20.898 --> 13:24.200
Hey.
So how'd it go with dad?

13:24.202 --> 13:27.404
Um, to be honest,

13:27.406 --> 13:29.940
I thought I spoke
with great wisdom and eloquence.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.509
I'm sure it was
the gettysburg address

13:31.511 --> 13:33.177
of pre-incarceration
pep talks.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.312
And?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.182
I don't think
he heard a word of it.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.617
If he did, he didn't let on.

13:38.619 --> 13:40.319
He was just staring at the wall
the whole time.

13:40.321 --> 13:43.723
Don't worry, Ev.
He'll be fine.

13:43.725 --> 13:46.226
Yeah. Yeah.

13:46.228 --> 13:48.761
Hank?

13:48.763 --> 13:50.764
I have a confession.

13:50.766 --> 13:53.132
No. No.
Don't have a confession.

13:53.134 --> 13:55.567
Why must you always
have a confession?

13:55.569 --> 13:58.070
Ugh. Okay. All right.

13:58.072 --> 14:00.572
Like a band-aid,
let's go.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.176
So after dad got out
of the hospital...

14:06.179 --> 14:08.412
- Boris approached me.
- Okay.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.947
And he offered to send dad

14:09.949 --> 14:12.983
on an all-expenses-paid
vacation.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.919
And now that dad
could actually use the help,

14:14.921 --> 14:17.254
we're dead to Boris.

14:19.057 --> 14:20.657
You're pissed
I didn't tell you.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.760
No.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.296
I'm glad you didn't tell dad.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.698
What? Why?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.300
I don't want to see dad
go to prison,

14:28.302 --> 14:29.968
but he's going.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.339
He can pay for his mistakes
and then start a new life.

14:33.341 --> 14:36.242
Not a life in hiding
or on the run,

14:36.244 --> 14:38.178
never being able
to see his family again.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.280
So you think
I did the right thing?

14:40.282 --> 14:44.184
By not presenting him
with an irresistible temptation?

14:44.186 --> 14:46.486
Yeah, I do.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.332
Good morning, kiddos.

15:04.334 --> 15:05.667
Hey.

15:05.669 --> 15:08.636
Pop, what's going on?

15:08.638 --> 15:10.238
Evan convinced me
to stop sitting around

15:10.240 --> 15:12.040
feeling sorry for myself.

15:12.042 --> 15:14.143
Gettysburg, anyone?

15:14.145 --> 15:16.078
- Good call, dad.
- Yeah.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.913
So what are you gonna do?

15:17.915 --> 15:20.149
I'm gonna hit
the sandwich shop.

15:20.151 --> 15:22.785
Then maybe some golf
with me and Paige later?

15:22.787 --> 15:25.821
All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll meet you in one hour.

15:25.823 --> 15:28.690
Awesome. Dad. Hank?

15:28.692 --> 15:31.059
I got to see a patient
before his fundraiser starts,

15:31.061 --> 15:32.727
and then I'll meet you guys
as soon as I can.

15:32.729 --> 15:34.195
Awesome.

15:34.197 --> 15:35.463
I'll go set it up.

15:35.465 --> 15:39.500
I'm gonna call Paige.

15:39.502 --> 15:41.368
Dad, I want you to know

15:41.370 --> 15:43.603
how proud of you I am
for going through with this.

15:43.605 --> 15:46.506
You're proud of me
for going to prison?

15:46.508 --> 15:50.578
No, I'm proud of you
for taking responsibility.

15:50.580 --> 15:54.749
Well, the credit
goes to my boys.

15:54.751 --> 15:58.219
You know, when I'm on my own,
Hank, I'm weak.

15:58.221 --> 16:01.190
When you boys are there for me,

16:01.192 --> 16:06.162
somehow I find the strength
to do the right thing.

16:06.164 --> 16:10.299
I'm really happy to hear that.

16:10.301 --> 16:11.834
Enjoy your smoked ham and brie.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.435
I will see you on the links.

16:13.437 --> 16:16.237
You bet.

16:24.313 --> 16:26.113
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting?

16:26.115 --> 16:27.581
- Yes, you are.
- No, you are not.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.585
I was just about to leave.
No, Marisa...

16:31.921 --> 16:33.889
I understand
how you feel about this.

16:33.891 --> 16:35.290
<i>Perfecto.</i>

16:35.292 --> 16:37.760
Now call me when you respect
how I feel about it.

16:37.762 --> 16:39.261
I will be in Manhattan
until then.

16:39.263 --> 16:40.696
<i>- No, Marisa...
- Ya.</i>

16:43.634 --> 16:45.868
Boris, uh, I'm here because...

16:45.870 --> 16:47.470
Yes, once again,

16:47.472 --> 16:49.138
I know exactly why
you're here, Mr. Lawson.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.973
Of course you do.

16:50.975 --> 16:53.275
You know,
it's a very generous offer.

16:53.277 --> 16:55.544
You're taking
an enormous risk for me.

16:55.546 --> 16:57.513
I'm not doing it for you.

16:57.515 --> 17:00.582
Well, who are you doing it for?

17:00.584 --> 17:04.152
For those who would be
better off in your absence.

17:07.189 --> 17:09.590
You're doing it for them.

17:12.194 --> 17:14.529
When do you turn yourself in
to the federal marshals?

17:14.531 --> 17:18.200
My boys
are taking me at 6:00.

17:18.202 --> 17:21.303
My driver
can pick you up at 5:00.

18:00.478 --> 18:03.278
Hey. John legend...
that's crazy.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.547
I know. He's amazing.

18:05.549 --> 18:09.818
Hey, so, um...

18:09.820 --> 18:11.420
I'm taking the job.

18:11.422 --> 18:14.524
Oh.
Okay, great.

18:14.526 --> 18:15.892
- Yeah.
- Congrats.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.660
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:17.662 --> 18:19.295
It was a really tough decision,

18:19.297 --> 18:21.397
but I ultimately
realized that...

18:21.399 --> 18:23.700
Hi, there.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.602
I'd like to, uh, talk
to you both,

18:25.604 --> 18:29.073
but, um, I should
probably start with Hank.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.474
Of course. Sure.

18:30.476 --> 18:31.842
Uh, please let me know

18:31.844 --> 18:33.978
if there's anything
I can do to help.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.780
What's going on?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.148
My leg weakness is increasing,

18:38.150 --> 18:40.418
even with that
high dose of steroids.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.520
Um, okay,
well, there's literature

18:42.522 --> 18:44.255
on the benefits
of plasmapheresis

18:44.257 --> 18:46.157
when the steroids
begin to fail.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.826
I will consult the specialist
at Hamptons heritage.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.963
I always knew
it was a progressive disease,

18:51.965 --> 18:54.265
and I've always
been prepared for this.

18:54.267 --> 18:58.303
I just hoped it wouldn't
happen this soon

18:58.305 --> 19:01.340
and certainly not right before
I'm supposed to go onstage

19:01.342 --> 19:02.641
in front of 200 people

19:02.643 --> 19:05.844
and tell them
not to be afraid of m.S.

19:05.846 --> 19:07.546
Well, Ben,
you don't look scared to me,

19:07.548 --> 19:08.981
not even a little bit.

19:08.983 --> 19:10.515
And those 200 people,

19:10.517 --> 19:14.718
well, they still need
to hear it.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.320
Thank you.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.589
Thanks.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.399
Are you ready
to seek my center?

19:28.401 --> 19:32.437
Mm, if I'm not too busy
chasing my desire.

19:33.841 --> 19:36.208
We're not gonna be ready
in time for the wedding, are we?

19:36.210 --> 19:39.045
It'll be like everything else
in our relationship.

19:39.047 --> 19:43.616
We'll fake it.

19:49.758 --> 19:51.957
How long have you
been like this?

19:51.959 --> 19:54.159
- I was coughing all night.
- And this morning?

19:54.161 --> 19:56.328
I couldn't get up.

19:56.330 --> 19:57.896
What happened when you tried?

19:57.898 --> 20:00.532
My legs wouldn't hold me.

20:06.071 --> 20:09.307
Here, here...

20:20.254 --> 20:22.089
Get my bag
from the car, please,

20:22.091 --> 20:24.825
and on your way out, call 911.

20:29.664 --> 20:32.700
I first hiked the appalachian
when I was 19.

20:32.702 --> 20:34.835
Greatest experience of my life.

20:34.837 --> 20:36.270
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

20:36.272 --> 20:37.771
A month later
when I was diagnosed,

20:37.773 --> 20:40.340
I remember the first thought
that went through my head...

20:40.342 --> 20:42.409
"I'd never hike again,"

20:42.411 --> 20:46.948
because that's what my disease
meant to me...

20:46.950 --> 20:49.884
sacrifice, inability,

20:49.886 --> 20:54.824
a slow decline
into a meaningless existence.

20:54.826 --> 20:56.526
But I woke up the next day

20:56.528 --> 21:00.730
and decided
I was not my disease.

21:00.732 --> 21:04.435
And every summer since then,
I've done two things...

21:04.437 --> 21:06.570
raise money for m.S.

21:06.572 --> 21:10.139
And walk 100 Miles
of the appalachian.

21:10.141 --> 21:12.075
I am not my disease.

21:12.077 --> 21:13.709
No one is.

21:19.115 --> 21:21.517
Tens of thousands of people

21:21.519 --> 21:24.786
are diagnosed
with m.S. Each year.

21:24.788 --> 21:27.089
Uh, rude much?

21:27.091 --> 21:29.558
Uh, I'm searching
his medical history.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.759
Why?

21:30.761 --> 21:32.227
Tens of thousands of people...

21:32.229 --> 21:34.896
- Just one sec, Jill.
- Lose hope each year.

21:34.898 --> 21:39.835
Tens of thousands of people
start that slow decline

21:39.837 --> 21:41.737
into a meaningless existence.

21:48.911 --> 21:50.946
- Hank.
- Just a sec.

21:50.948 --> 21:52.614
No, Hank,
something's not right.

21:56.352 --> 21:59.354
People like you and me,
we have the resources

21:59.356 --> 22:02.724
to help bring these people

22:02.726 --> 22:04.959
out of despair

22:04.961 --> 22:08.063
and help them proclaim,

22:08.065 --> 22:11.065
"I am not my disease."

22:11.067 --> 22:14.069
Thank you.

22:18.674 --> 22:21.008
I think he just went blind.

22:21.010 --> 22:23.344
And I think I know why.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.796
Are you gonna tell me
what you're thinking,

22:28.798 --> 22:30.298
or are you gonna make me guess?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.933
I'm thinking
about his diagnosis.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.100
Well, what about it?

22:33.102 --> 22:34.735
Well, he was 19 when he got it.

22:34.737 --> 22:36.036
Yeah, a lot of m.S. Patients

22:36.038 --> 22:37.404
become symptomatic
around that age.

22:37.406 --> 22:38.605
Yeah, only a few weeks

22:38.607 --> 22:40.240
after hiking through
the appalachian trail?

22:40.242 --> 22:42.509
- What are you saying?
- His meds aren't working.

22:42.511 --> 22:44.912
He has chronic joint pain,
which doesn't line up with m.S.,

22:44.914 --> 22:46.547
and I'm starting
to wonder about something.

22:46.549 --> 22:48.749
Okay.
What's the next step?

22:48.751 --> 22:51.085
I need your lab to run
one more test on his blood.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.490
So how's your vision?

22:56.492 --> 22:59.393
Uh, it's back,
though a bit blurry.

22:59.395 --> 23:03.064
You're Jill Casey, right?

23:03.066 --> 23:06.401
Well, hopefully
it'll keep improving.

23:06.403 --> 23:08.637
It never got
that blurry before.

23:08.639 --> 23:12.340
So I guess I should speak
to my neurologist

23:12.342 --> 23:15.610
about plasmapheresis.

23:15.612 --> 23:18.446
Actually, I'd hold off on that.

23:18.448 --> 23:19.814
Why?

23:19.816 --> 23:21.516
I combed through
your medical history,

23:21.518 --> 23:24.719
and it looks like you were never
tested for lyme disease.

23:24.721 --> 23:27.590
I'm, uh, pretty sure
I was tested for everything.

23:27.592 --> 23:30.092
They probably just ran
out of room on my chart.

23:30.094 --> 23:32.161
Yeah. Right.

23:32.163 --> 23:36.599
Right, but do you specifically
remember being tested for lyme?

23:36.601 --> 23:40.904
What's your point,
Dr. Lawson?

23:40.906 --> 23:43.941
You may not have m.S.

23:48.379 --> 23:50.847
That's absurd.

23:50.849 --> 23:53.182
Maybe, but Hamptons heritage

23:53.184 --> 23:55.618
is running a lyme titer
just in case.

23:55.620 --> 23:58.654
You think
you're the first doctor

23:58.656 --> 24:00.923
to have a hospital
run my blood?

24:00.925 --> 24:03.392
I think the doctors
who diagnosed you 20 years ago

24:03.394 --> 24:06.595
may have overlooked a disease
not endemic to new Mexico.

24:06.597 --> 24:08.965
The appalachian trail,
on the other hand...

24:08.967 --> 24:10.467
and every specialist I've seen?

24:10.469 --> 24:12.603
They may have simply accepted
the diagnosis

24:12.605 --> 24:14.138
you walked in the door with,

24:14.140 --> 24:16.007
because most of the time
that's just the way it works.

24:16.009 --> 24:17.809
I have m.S.
It's a fact.

24:17.811 --> 24:19.510
- Why?
- Because look at me!

24:19.512 --> 24:22.180
I am M.S.!

24:22.182 --> 24:24.449
A lot of people
would be surprised to hear that

24:24.451 --> 24:26.484
coming from you.

24:31.224 --> 24:32.991
Can you offer proof
of diagnosis?

24:32.993 --> 24:34.325
Not yet, but...

24:34.327 --> 24:37.395
then all you can offer
is wild speculation...

24:37.397 --> 24:39.531
And false hope,

24:39.533 --> 24:43.068
which I learned to ignore
a long time ago.

24:50.343 --> 24:52.311
Great shot, Paige.

24:52.313 --> 24:54.180
I'm sorry, guys.

24:54.182 --> 24:57.350
It was the only tee time
left in the Hamptons.

24:57.352 --> 24:58.785
I think it's adorable.

24:58.787 --> 25:01.055
Yeah, and you know
how much I love windmills.

25:01.057 --> 25:02.423
I do, as a matter of fact.

25:02.425 --> 25:04.024
Oh, excuse me.

25:04.026 --> 25:05.893
I have to go putt through
the mouth of a giant lobster.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.295
Enjoy.

25:08.297 --> 25:10.963
You told her.

25:10.965 --> 25:12.165
Told her what?

25:12.167 --> 25:14.633
How you feel about her.

25:18.738 --> 25:20.972
- I did, actually.
- Mm-hmm.

25:20.974 --> 25:23.007
The other night.

25:23.009 --> 25:24.742
Turns out
she feels the same way.

25:24.744 --> 25:28.079
About you?
Who wouldn't?

25:28.081 --> 25:29.814
How did you know that?

25:29.816 --> 25:31.816
The look on your face.

25:31.818 --> 25:33.785
There's a look that says that?

25:33.787 --> 25:36.421
Ho, ho, there's a look.

25:36.423 --> 25:38.357
I'm gonna miss playing golf
with you, dad.

25:38.359 --> 25:40.226
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna miss the golf,

25:40.228 --> 25:42.394
because I've got shuffleboard
to fall back on.

25:42.396 --> 25:45.297
- Right.
- Nailed it.

25:45.299 --> 25:47.033
But I am gonna miss
spending time

25:47.035 --> 25:48.768
with the hottest couple
in the Hamptons.

25:48.770 --> 25:50.436
No, you won't.

25:50.438 --> 25:51.705
Tell him.

25:51.707 --> 25:55.576
We are gonna bring
the heat to you.

25:55.578 --> 25:56.911
You are?

25:56.913 --> 25:58.780
Yep, we're already
planning our first trip

25:58.782 --> 26:00.181
down to Coleman, Florida.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.617
But don't worry, Eddie.

26:02.619 --> 26:04.886
We'll let Hank
and your shmoopy tag along.

26:04.888 --> 26:06.320
Yeah, shmoopy can come.

26:06.322 --> 26:08.423
You know, whether
you come to visit or not,

26:08.425 --> 26:10.791
I can't tell you how much
the thought means to me.

26:10.793 --> 26:12.459
Dad...

26:12.461 --> 26:14.394
and I'm so grateful

26:14.396 --> 26:18.664
for the time we get to spend
together right now.

26:18.666 --> 26:20.733
You have a problem?
Is that Hank?

26:20.735 --> 26:22.635
Yeah. Yeah.
He had an emergency,

26:22.637 --> 26:25.638
so he'll meet us
at Newberg's, all right?

26:25.640 --> 26:28.642
But he'll be there by the time
you need to ship out.

26:33.949 --> 26:36.951
Your clinical diagnosis
is pneumonia,

26:36.953 --> 26:38.620
probably bacterial.

26:38.622 --> 26:40.088
Or you admitted me

26:40.090 --> 26:42.491
because you couldn't face
your final lesson.

26:42.493 --> 26:44.060
Your doctors here

26:44.062 --> 26:47.630
will examine your sputum
and continue antibiotics.

26:47.632 --> 26:49.031
And all I can do is lie here.

26:49.033 --> 26:51.400
No, no.
You can contact Olga.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.569
It's likely that she has
pneumonia as well,

26:53.571 --> 26:55.838
and she should get treatment
wherever she is.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.441
I will call her right away.

26:58.443 --> 27:00.109
Divya...

27:00.111 --> 27:04.347
I felt indebted to you
after you fixed my toe.

27:04.349 --> 27:06.416
Now you rescued me from this.

27:06.418 --> 27:10.353
Well, I guess I was fated to.

27:10.355 --> 27:12.889
I wish you two the very best.

27:12.891 --> 27:16.493
Now, please, go practice.

27:19.864 --> 27:21.331
So he'll be okay?

27:21.333 --> 27:24.034
Well, now that he's here,
he should be.

27:24.036 --> 27:26.636
You were right
about his coughing.

27:26.638 --> 27:28.605
What did you assume?

27:28.607 --> 27:31.307
That you were simply
suffering separation anxiety

27:31.309 --> 27:32.675
from your job.

27:32.677 --> 27:35.145
Well, they are not
mutually exclusive.

27:35.147 --> 27:37.080
My point is I'm impressed.

27:37.082 --> 27:38.781
I hospitalized a man
with a cough.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.449
I'd never seen you
in action before...

27:41.451 --> 27:44.119
taking control,
making decisions,

27:44.121 --> 27:48.057
in your element.

27:48.059 --> 27:50.727
Well, I love what I do.

27:50.729 --> 27:52.162
I can tell.

27:52.164 --> 27:55.600
And I see just how much
you're giving up...

27:55.602 --> 27:58.603
For us.

27:58.605 --> 28:01.573
Well, I guess we both
have a lot to learn...

28:01.575 --> 28:04.509
Starting with the tango.

28:24.795 --> 28:26.262
That's Boris' car.

28:26.264 --> 28:28.164
I wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.567
I'm sorry
I wasn't here sooner, but...

28:31.569 --> 28:34.571
I'm here now.

28:34.573 --> 28:36.840
And so am I.

28:36.842 --> 28:39.074
We're both here...

28:39.076 --> 28:42.978
With you, for you.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.813
Whether that really
does make the difference,

28:44.815 --> 28:47.649
well, that's for you to decide.

28:55.924 --> 28:57.691
You sure you don't want
to be there for me

28:57.693 --> 29:01.761
on a tropical island?

29:01.763 --> 29:04.197
What?
I'm kidding.

29:04.199 --> 29:05.999
I'm just checking.

29:06.001 --> 29:07.768
Let's catch a plane.

29:07.770 --> 29:09.937
I can't wait.

29:15.110 --> 29:17.178
Here you go, tiger.
Buckle up.

29:25.823 --> 29:27.223
Thank you.

29:30.961 --> 29:32.562
What's this?

29:32.564 --> 29:34.831
Proof of diagnosis.

29:39.604 --> 29:43.274
My lyme titers are elevated.

29:43.276 --> 29:47.745
Take your time
processing all of this.

29:47.747 --> 29:49.146
I wonder when exactly

29:49.148 --> 29:52.983
I started living in ignorance
of my own advice...

29:52.985 --> 29:57.387
When I let m.S. Become
not just my disease,

29:57.389 --> 30:00.957
but my identity.

30:00.959 --> 30:04.227
I know this is a shock, Ben,
but it's also a reprieve.

30:04.229 --> 30:06.863
Your prognosis just took a turn
for the better.

30:06.865 --> 30:08.697
Lyme disease can be treatable.

30:08.699 --> 30:11.568
In fact, there's a shot you
could be symptom-free after...

30:11.570 --> 30:14.871
A couple of months
of ceftriaxone.

30:16.374 --> 30:18.809
I've been doing some homework.

30:18.811 --> 30:20.477
Something tells me

30:20.479 --> 30:22.312
you're gonna get to know
lyme disease

30:22.314 --> 30:23.914
every bit as much
as you did m.S.

30:34.359 --> 30:37.527
Dude, do you really need
to take all that?

30:37.529 --> 30:39.329
I'm prepared
for every contingency.

30:39.331 --> 30:41.165
Oh, okay, good.

30:41.167 --> 30:42.732
Except for my girlfriend
being late.

30:42.734 --> 30:44.201
You don't take off
for six hours.

30:44.203 --> 30:45.669
I know. I want
to take full advantage

30:45.671 --> 30:47.004
of the business-class lounge.

30:47.006 --> 30:48.939
They've got hot towels, man,
and free Internet.

30:48.941 --> 30:51.641
- Mm. Thank God for airports.
- Oh, and don't forget,

30:51.643 --> 30:53.677
dad's gonna call at some point
in the next 24 hours,

30:53.679 --> 30:55.079
after he gets processed.

30:55.081 --> 30:56.380
You know how I'll remember?

30:56.382 --> 30:57.848
My phone'll ring,
so that'll help.

30:57.850 --> 30:59.316
But thank you.

30:59.318 --> 31:01.485
Can you believe
dad's in prison?

31:01.487 --> 31:02.853
I know.

31:02.855 --> 31:05.522
It's definitely surreal.
Yeah.

31:05.524 --> 31:07.591
I'm just glad
he made the right decision.

31:07.593 --> 31:09.526
He did that
because of you, you know.

31:09.528 --> 31:12.329
You always understood him
better than anyone.

31:12.331 --> 31:13.864
You knew all his tricks.

31:13.866 --> 31:15.866
You're the one
who was right about him...

31:15.868 --> 31:17.501
From the day he got out here...

31:17.503 --> 31:20.705
About giving him
a second chance.

31:20.707 --> 31:22.507
Maybe it doesn't matter
who was right

31:22.509 --> 31:24.476
about the man he used to be.

31:24.478 --> 31:26.978
He's a better man now.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.980
Amen to that, brother.

31:35.855 --> 31:37.422
- Dude.
- Hey.

31:37.424 --> 31:39.257
You're such a diva.

31:39.259 --> 31:42.160
<i>All right, guys, I guess
I don't need all this stuff.</i>

31:42.162 --> 31:44.328
- Yeah.
- Actually, you might.

31:44.330 --> 31:45.829
What's that supposed to mean?

31:45.831 --> 31:48.332
- I had a crazy thought.
- Evan's favorite kind.

31:48.334 --> 31:51.034
What if we made
a few quick stops

31:51.036 --> 31:52.169
on the way back from London?

31:52.171 --> 31:53.470
Quick stops where?

31:53.472 --> 31:56.807
I don't know...
Paris, Rome, Athens.

31:56.809 --> 31:59.877
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

31:59.879 --> 32:01.712
That sounds amazing.

32:01.714 --> 32:03.948
That sounds
ridiculously amazing.

32:03.950 --> 32:05.749
But I can't.
Why not?

32:05.751 --> 32:08.252
- Yeah, why not?
- 'Cause I...

32:08.254 --> 32:10.420
Hankmed...
I can't go awol right now.

32:10.422 --> 32:11.855
We're already short a Divya.

32:11.857 --> 32:14.524
Uh, Paige,
will you excuse us a sec?

32:14.526 --> 32:16.327
Just one sec.
Could we?

32:16.329 --> 32:17.728
- Hold on. One sec.
- Yeah.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.697
Uh, dude, what are you doing?

32:19.699 --> 32:21.699
What? I can't just
leave you high and dry.

32:21.701 --> 32:24.535
I'll be low and wet
till you get back, trust me.

32:24.537 --> 32:27.706
The summer's over.
Business is slowing down.

32:27.708 --> 32:30.475
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime, man,

32:30.477 --> 32:34.613
especially of your lifetime.

32:34.615 --> 32:37.049
Take it.

32:37.051 --> 32:38.551
Please.

32:38.553 --> 32:41.354
Wow.
You really mean it.

32:41.356 --> 32:44.425
If you don't go with her,
I will.

32:48.830 --> 32:51.499
I'm about to leave
on my dream vacation

32:51.501 --> 32:55.970
from my dream job
with my dream girl.

32:55.972 --> 32:58.105
Thank you, bro.

33:03.211 --> 33:05.012
Evan?

33:07.582 --> 33:10.517
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:37.542 --> 33:40.211
The birthplace of hankmed...

33:40.213 --> 33:43.581
I never took you
for the nostalgic type.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.683
I couldn't think
of a better place

33:45.685 --> 33:47.652
to thank you for your vision.

33:47.654 --> 33:49.153
It was hardly a vision.

33:49.155 --> 33:50.989
Well, your projections
were convincing.

33:50.991 --> 33:55.126
Well, they were based
on, uh, creative math.

33:55.128 --> 33:56.461
I know.

33:58.799 --> 34:00.866
I wanted to thank you too

34:00.868 --> 34:03.502
for believing in me,

34:03.504 --> 34:05.637
betting on me.

34:05.639 --> 34:08.273
It paid off, big-time.

34:11.210 --> 34:13.277
The keys to the hankmed mobile?

34:13.280 --> 34:15.179
You'll look after it for me?

34:15.181 --> 34:17.547
Selling it
was harder than I expected.

34:17.550 --> 34:20.317
The market for an SUV full
of medical supplies is limited?

34:20.319 --> 34:21.818
Extremely limited.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.719
Well, I'm pretty attached
to my current vehicle,

34:23.722 --> 34:25.188
but I'll keep yours safe.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.389
Maybe drive it to a follow-up
from time to time.

34:27.391 --> 34:30.293
Please don't forget
to follow up with Niko.

34:30.295 --> 34:31.962
I don't know.
Something's bothering me

34:31.964 --> 34:33.397
about the time line
of his illness.

34:33.399 --> 34:34.731
Divya...

34:34.733 --> 34:35.899
They should test
for strep pneumonia.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.601
I mean, maybe even
legionnaire's.

34:37.603 --> 34:38.902
- Divya.
- Yeah?

34:38.905 --> 34:42.540
This table does
funny things to you.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.542
It's gonna be
an adjustment, huh?

34:44.543 --> 34:46.643
I've just got to listen
to the music.

34:46.645 --> 34:48.712
Uh, what music?

34:49.815 --> 34:53.516
It is the first rule
of tango...

34:53.518 --> 34:55.451
listen to the music.

34:55.453 --> 34:58.321
Any second
it can change on you.

34:58.323 --> 35:00.656
You have to be ready to pivot

35:00.658 --> 35:03.492
and move
in an entirely new direction.

35:03.494 --> 35:07.730
Best of luck
in your new direction.

35:07.732 --> 35:10.366
I know it'll take you
to amazing places.

35:23.014 --> 35:25.916
So how are you gonna keep
yourself busy?

35:25.918 --> 35:27.752
Well, there's the clinic.

35:27.754 --> 35:29.954
And apparently
not everyone out here

35:29.956 --> 35:32.123
jumps ship after labor day.

35:34.027 --> 35:36.427
Yeah, I can't believe
the summer's over.

35:36.429 --> 35:38.363
I can't believe
you're leaving the Hamptons.

35:38.365 --> 35:39.764
I know.

35:39.766 --> 35:42.534
There's a first time
for everything.

35:42.536 --> 35:45.571
Yeah, just
when we were starting...

35:45.573 --> 35:47.173
Yeah.

35:47.175 --> 35:48.975
Let's not focus on that.

35:48.977 --> 35:50.310
It's too painful for you.

35:50.312 --> 35:52.379
I get it.
It's cool.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.314
No, I'll miss you...

35:54.316 --> 35:55.749
A lot.

35:55.751 --> 35:57.852
But I don't want to end
our last day together

35:57.854 --> 35:59.220
talking about that.

35:59.222 --> 36:01.656
I just want to enjoy
being here...

36:01.658 --> 36:04.159
With you...

36:04.161 --> 36:06.027
Right now.

36:06.029 --> 36:07.829
I love that idea.

36:30.825 --> 36:33.126
Oh, I'm glad
I didn't miss you guys.

36:33.128 --> 36:35.062
So Jill's still coming?
Good.

36:35.064 --> 36:36.530
What, you thought
she got cold feet?

36:36.532 --> 36:37.731
Eh, it's a big job.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.800
I've been left standing
at the heliport before.

36:41.270 --> 36:44.505
Anyway, uh, I'm glad
you made it also.

36:46.509 --> 36:48.342
I want to thank you
for everything,

36:48.344 --> 36:51.345
starting with the fact
that I have no achy joints

36:51.347 --> 36:54.715
for the first time
since I can remember.

36:54.717 --> 36:57.851
I am so happy
to hear that, Ben.

36:57.853 --> 37:02.188
You know, I'm always looking
for great doctors too.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.490
You know any?

37:04.492 --> 37:06.492
Seriously,
if you get bored here

37:06.494 --> 37:07.893
and want to see the world...

37:07.895 --> 37:09.595
Well, I appreciate the offer,

37:09.597 --> 37:13.232
but, uh, I'm still getting
to know the Hamptons.

37:24.079 --> 37:26.347
This is Hank.

37:33.690 --> 37:36.057
Didn't we say
our good-byes already?

37:36.059 --> 37:37.492
Are there a lot of people
around you?

37:37.494 --> 37:39.928
What do you mean are there
a lot of people around?

37:39.930 --> 37:41.363
It's an airport.

37:41.365 --> 37:44.399
Divya, Niko doesn't have
a community-acquired pneumonia.

37:44.401 --> 37:46.935
He has an infection...

37:46.937 --> 37:48.970
<i>Caused by yersinia pestis.</i>

37:48.972 --> 37:50.739
Everything okay?

37:50.741 --> 37:53.341
Are you or raj symptomatic?

37:53.343 --> 37:56.178
No.
N-no symptoms so far, no.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.381
You know you can't get
on that plane, right?

37:58.383 --> 37:59.749
I understand.

37:59.751 --> 38:02.653
I assume that
you have notified the CDC?

38:05.258 --> 38:06.558
Never mind.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.493
I will, uh, keep you posted.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.830
No need.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.932
Divya, what's going on?

38:13.934 --> 38:15.967
We are going into quarantine.

38:15.969 --> 38:17.402
Quarantine? Why?

38:17.404 --> 38:18.603
Because we need to make sure

38:18.605 --> 38:20.338
that we didn't catch
what Niko has.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.741
Hi.
I'm Divya Katdare.

38:22.743 --> 38:24.409
Thank you, ma'am.

38:24.411 --> 38:27.412
Pneumonia?

38:27.414 --> 38:29.381
The plague.

38:29.383 --> 38:32.083
The plague,
in the 21st century?

38:32.085 --> 38:34.386
Pneumonic plague,
to be specific.

38:34.388 --> 38:36.455
That still sounds pretty bad.

38:36.457 --> 38:37.622
Is it deadly?

38:37.624 --> 38:40.425
Only if left untreated.

38:48.168 --> 38:50.602
So what happens now?

38:50.604 --> 38:52.171
Well, they'll, um...

38:52.173 --> 38:54.173
they'll get us
prophylactic antibiotics.

38:54.175 --> 38:56.141
And they'll monitor us.

38:56.143 --> 38:57.543
For how long?

38:57.545 --> 38:59.611
At least a week,

38:59.613 --> 39:03.248
longer if we develop symptoms.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.084
We'll have to postpone
the wedding.

39:08.520 --> 39:12.256
Raj...

39:12.258 --> 39:14.191
We have to cancel the wedding.

39:14.193 --> 39:15.726
Cancel?

39:15.728 --> 39:16.960
What are you saying?

39:16.962 --> 39:20.030
I'm saying
that it's the plague.

39:20.032 --> 39:22.933
Did you need the locusts
and the hail as well?

39:25.704 --> 39:28.739
Look...

39:28.741 --> 39:32.944
I'm sorry, but I can't go
through with this.

39:32.946 --> 39:36.947
The universe has sent me
one message too many.

39:42.186 --> 39:45.088
What happened
to our obligation?

39:48.526 --> 39:51.896
Ignoring my obligation
will be hard.

39:51.898 --> 39:55.733
But ignoring my fate
would be harder.
