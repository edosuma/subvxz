00:06.990 --> 00:07.979
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.191 --> 00:10.716
- Thanks for covering.
- Lf you don't know, ask.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.794
You mean the EMS Medical Director
is a real person?

00:13.997 --> 00:15.396
Yeah, he's an ER doc.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.793
I thought it was a name
on top of memos.

00:18.001 --> 00:18.933
Not when I do it.

00:19.135 --> 00:22.298
- You're a Pediatric Emergency Fellow?
- One under the boss.

00:22.505 --> 00:24.370
You're thinking of starting over?

00:24.574 --> 00:27.304
It's a means to what I want,
which is to stay here.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.205
I'm an ER doc, just like you.

00:29.412 --> 00:32.870
Not like me. You acted without
the consent of your colleagues.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.814
Reece can't hear talking or the phone.
It's a severe-to-profound loss.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.656
Excuse me. You gonna be long?

00:47.864 --> 00:49.798
No, almost done. Just a minute.

00:51.034 --> 00:53.867
- Why start with the copy room?
- Got a work order.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.562
Well, other rooms in the ER
need paint more than this one.

00:57.774 --> 01:00.402
Lady, I just do
what they tell me to do.

01:02.846 --> 01:05.815
So how was your skating party?
Did you have fun?

01:06.316 --> 01:07.442
Yeah.

01:08.184 --> 01:10.345
Mostly kids from your soccer camp?

01:10.720 --> 01:12.210
Some.

01:12.922 --> 01:14.287
Juliet?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.483
It's Julianne. She wasn't there.

01:17.694 --> 01:19.218
So who was there?

01:19.829 --> 01:22.059
Just kids.

01:27.403 --> 01:28.597
Hello?

01:29.305 --> 01:31.967
Oh, hi, Mom. I just knew it was you.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.635
Yeah.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.368
Oh, no. I had a great time.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.212
Oh, you'll never guess who was there.

01:40.316 --> 01:44.047
Well, Stephanie, she had this
sort of yellow sweater.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.355
Remember that time I went
to the mall with you...

01:47.557 --> 01:51.049
...and I saw that orange sweater
that really matched my blue skirt?

01:51.895 --> 01:54.659
Well, this one looks even better.

01:56.599 --> 01:57.793
Interim?

01:58.001 --> 01:59.366
Yes.

02:00.670 --> 02:04.697
Well, has there been any change
in my responsibilities?

02:04.908 --> 02:07.069
No, it's just around the table...

02:07.277 --> 02:10.713
...we felt that "interim"
was a more accurate term.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.712
So you're the Interim Chief, Kerry.

02:14.651 --> 02:15.948
Fine.

02:16.152 --> 02:20.054
But, Don, it has been over 90 days
since Dr. Morgenstern resigned.

02:20.256 --> 02:23.089
Then policy dictates
that a permanent chief be named.

02:23.293 --> 02:25.853
It's all in the process.
We've put out feelers.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.690
Thus far we have
four outstanding candidates.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.388
We're forming a committee.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.228
So four candidates, including me?

02:33.703 --> 02:36.331
Actually, you make it five.

02:38.441 --> 02:39.772
Just one more thing.

02:39.976 --> 02:43.503
You know, I did a performance
review of Doug Ross.

02:43.713 --> 02:46.648
You gave me an evaluation
of the ultra-rapid detox.

02:46.850 --> 02:51.014
Yeah. This is an overall
evaluation of his work.

02:51.221 --> 02:55.385
It'll help in deciding whether he
should be made an ER Pedes Attending.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.923
I'll pass it along.

02:58.061 --> 02:59.187
Thank you.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.496
Dr. Carter?

03:02.832 --> 03:04.356
Ethan Luitly, remember?

03:04.567 --> 03:07.764
The guy next door plays Pumpkins
so loud I can't study.

03:07.971 --> 03:09.268
He told me he'd stop.

03:09.472 --> 03:13.169
- It's okay now but I'm sensitive...
- I'm late. Can we talk later?

03:13.376 --> 03:16.743
- Oh, God! Log jam.
- Dude! It's flooding my stall!

03:16.946 --> 03:18.379
Not again!

03:18.581 --> 03:20.173
All right, I'll fix it.

03:21.417 --> 03:22.714
Come out. I'll fix it.

03:22.919 --> 03:25.479
Shut off the water
before it floods the hall.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.953
- Lift the lid.
- I've done this before.

03:29.158 --> 03:33.094
- Just pull the chain.
- Maintenance uses the shut-off valve!

04:28.484 --> 04:30.247
Randi, have you seen my student?

04:30.453 --> 04:32.284
She was just looking for you.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.319
- What?
- You're looking mythical.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.756
Carter, Curtain 4, LOL,
weak and dizzy.

04:38.962 --> 04:42.125
Hey, Mark? What does...

04:43.166 --> 04:45.191
What does "interim" mean to you?

04:45.401 --> 04:46.766
"In-between."

04:46.970 --> 04:49.734
Do you think that's
a stronger word than "acting"?

04:49.939 --> 04:52.169
Your new title?
I liked "acting" better.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.570
They're forming a review committee.

04:54.777 --> 04:57.268
- Anspaugh told me.
- He asked me to be on it.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.847
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- Why not? I can be impartial.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.848
But my hat's in the ring
and we work together.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.250
I'd hate for there to be
any suggestion of favoritism.

05:07.457 --> 05:10.585
- You don't think I should?
- Well, I just want to be fair.

05:10.793 --> 05:12.727
No problem. I'll pass.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.797
Hey, want to sneak away for lunch?
Rosebud. On me?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.968
- What's the occasion?
- Just to talk.

05:19.168 --> 05:21.193
- About what?
- Over lunch.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.134
- Okay, sure.
- Good.

05:25.308 --> 05:26.900
Hi. Is Carol around?

05:27.110 --> 05:28.099
Yeah. She's just...

05:28.311 --> 05:30.745
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah. I am reborn.

05:30.947 --> 05:32.881
- Oh, God, you look great!
- Thanks.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.812
- Where did you go again?
- The Laurentian Wilderness.

05:36.019 --> 05:39.113
I'd stay away from anyplace
with "wilderness" in its name.

05:39.322 --> 05:41.381
It was great.
I was in the music camp.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.684
We jammed all night long, every night.

05:43.893 --> 05:46.123
Rock, salsa, gospel, whatever.

05:46.329 --> 05:48.524
That kind of "wild" I can get with!

05:48.731 --> 05:51.894
Jeanie, this is Lynette,
our own nurse practitioner.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.569
Welcome. I'm not on until noon, guys.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.467
I'm doing paperwork,
so tell me if you need help.

05:57.673 --> 06:01.109
Volunteering? You did just come
straight from the wilderness.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.743
Well, here you go.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.479
How about John Esmond?

06:04.680 --> 06:07.308
Seven years old, losing weight,
no insurance, Curtain 2.

06:07.517 --> 06:08.506
- Sure.
- Thank you.

06:08.718 --> 06:11.312
- It's 8:30 already!
- Hello.

06:11.521 --> 06:13.113
You know how long we waited?

06:13.423 --> 06:16.119
Sorry about that.
Hey, John. My name is Jeanie.

06:16.325 --> 06:20.523
I'm putting this thermometer under
your arm. Hold it there for me.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.397
Has he complained
of cramps or diarrhea?

06:24.600 --> 06:27.262
No. But look what he threw up.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.267
- What are those?
- Roundworms.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.197
- Worms?
- Yeah.

06:31.407 --> 06:35.104
- How's everything going?
- Well, you know, back to civilization.

06:35.945 --> 06:38.846
My findings are nearly identical
to the audiologist's.

06:39.048 --> 06:41.744
With the results of both tests
being so close...

06:41.951 --> 06:43.646
...I'd say this is reliable data.

06:43.853 --> 06:46.048
I've done research
on cochlear implants.

06:46.255 --> 06:48.485
How they've restored
hearing to the deaf.

06:48.691 --> 06:52.092
But implant surgery requires
destruction of residual hearing.

06:52.295 --> 06:56.288
But what difference does it make
if the surgery will allow him to hear?

06:56.499 --> 07:00.492
Given the FDA criteria,
he's not a candidate at this time.

07:00.703 --> 07:04.605
Your son can be helped by less
invasive methods. Hearing aids.

07:05.475 --> 07:09.138
- The new digital hearing aid.
- Paired with intensive speech therapy.

07:09.479 --> 07:12.573
What about sign language?

07:12.882 --> 07:16.875
Why limit him to signing when
we can teach him to hear and speak?

07:17.987 --> 07:19.113
Okay.

07:20.623 --> 07:24.889
So, what do we do to get
this digital hearing aid?

07:27.697 --> 07:30.962
So they do this thing with scallops
and a white wine sauce...

07:31.167 --> 07:32.759
What is this lunch about?

07:32.969 --> 07:33.958
All in good time.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.468
Just tell me. You can't keep secrets.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.038
- I'm in control. It's a new me.
- Really?

07:39.242 --> 07:41.073
Could the "new you" see a kid?

07:41.277 --> 07:45.008
- He's got a parasite infection.
- I have 10 minutes. I have paperwork.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.306
Is it bad?

07:46.516 --> 07:48.814
It might kill your interest
in the scallops.

07:49.418 --> 07:51.818
Yeah, found these in the copy machine.

07:53.122 --> 07:55.818
Hey, throw that in Dr. Ross' box.

07:56.092 --> 07:58.424
Dr. Carter, do you remember me?
Roxanne?

07:58.628 --> 08:00.960
I spoke to you
at Jerry's surprise party.

08:01.164 --> 08:03.724
- You were selling disability insurance.
- Right.

08:03.933 --> 08:06.231
I'm "more likely
to be maimed than killed"?

08:06.435 --> 08:08.494
Sorry, I didn't mean to pressure you.

08:08.704 --> 08:10.831
I'm here to sign up
one of your nurses.

08:11.340 --> 08:15.276
But my toe is still a little sore.
The one I dropped the weight on.

08:15.478 --> 08:18.845
- Would you mind taking a look?
- Sure. Hop up here.

08:20.783 --> 08:23.650
Did I tell you I'm also
selling mutual funds now?

08:23.853 --> 08:26.845
I just started.
Such an exciting arena.

08:27.123 --> 08:29.523
- A little tender right there.
- Sorry.

08:29.725 --> 08:32.250
Selling straight funds
or variable annuities?

08:32.461 --> 08:33.894
You know about annuities?

08:34.096 --> 08:37.929
Once your Keogh's maxed out, you need
a vehicle for tax-deferred income.

08:38.134 --> 08:41.399
But most people can't lock up
their money until retirement.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.469
That's where muni bonds come in.

08:43.673 --> 08:47.234
Well, this is healing.
It'll just take a little more time.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.673
Avoid stomping your feet.
You'll be fine.

08:49.879 --> 08:53.610
- No slam dancing to the Beastie Boys?
- Slow dancing.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.084
Whatever you say, Dr. Carter.

08:57.153 --> 08:58.347
Thank you.

09:06.229 --> 09:08.424
This is rather nostalgic.

09:09.165 --> 09:11.633
My last day as a Surgical Fellow.

09:12.268 --> 09:16.102
At least it's a beginning
of something rather substantial.

09:16.305 --> 09:19.536
A gastroplasty
on a 400-pound gentleman.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.237
Did I make the wrong choice?

09:24.447 --> 09:25.846
It's not for me to say.

09:26.048 --> 09:29.245
Still, I wouldn't mind
hearing your opinion.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.351
Is there some ominous portent
in that long pause?

09:35.558 --> 09:38.288
I just can't imagine
being an intern again.

09:38.894 --> 09:40.919
I'm determined not to whine about it.

09:41.130 --> 09:44.065
And I feel very good
about not leaving the hospital.

09:45.268 --> 09:47.395
You might as well take a coffee break.

09:47.603 --> 09:50.197
Our patient just expired in the SICU.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.976
- What's this?
- Rodney MacMullen, 48.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.044
- Oh, God!
- Carving knife versus forehead.

09:58.247 --> 10:01.478
Good vitals, no visual complaints
but drunk and combative.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.844
Lucy, come on!

10:03.052 --> 10:08.388
Damn beans! You give them work,
they don't care! Son of a bitch!

10:09.025 --> 10:10.583
All right, everybody.

10:10.793 --> 10:12.158
Be nice and gentle.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.953
On my count:

10:14.163 --> 10:17.132
One, two, three.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.728
Pancho must die.
I'll blow his brains out

10:19.935 --> 10:22.665
- Hold him down.
- I got his legs. Lucy, get his arm!

10:22.872 --> 10:24.134
I'll get restraints!

10:24.340 --> 10:29.039
CBC, Chem-7, PT, PTT,
type and cross for two units.

10:29.245 --> 10:31.406
Pupils equal, react to light.

10:31.614 --> 10:33.377
- Sir, hold still.
- Let me get up.

10:33.582 --> 10:36.176
- How do I tie him?
- Tie his wrist to the frame.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.876
- Gram of Ancef?
- Do you have any allergies?

10:39.088 --> 10:41.283
- Just let me up!
- Go with the Ancef.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.253
Carol, can you hold his head?

10:43.459 --> 10:46.189
I want to look in the mouth.
Sir, open your mouth.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.386
- He's tied!
- Okay, Lucy, take a look.

10:48.597 --> 10:52.055
The blade's in the oropharynx
and penetrated the frontal sinuses.

10:52.268 --> 10:55.396
- Missed the eyes completely.
- Son of a bitch!

10:57.573 --> 10:59.097
Lucy!

10:59.308 --> 11:02.800
Lucy, you tied him to the rail,
not the frame. You don't listen.

11:03.012 --> 11:05.003
Hey, hey! Don't spit!

11:05.314 --> 11:08.909
Carol, give him five Haldol, I.M.
Sir, don't spit.

11:09.118 --> 11:10.346
Put this on.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.987
Not you, Lucy! Him!

11:18.594 --> 11:20.084
- Dana, this is Dr. Ross.
- Hi.

11:20.296 --> 11:22.321
Hey, Dana. How are you feeling?

11:22.531 --> 11:23.589
I'm okay.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.164
Any more pain?

11:25.368 --> 11:27.598
It's still there a bit
but I don't mind.

11:27.803 --> 11:30.465
All right. Let's take a look
at the damage here.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.707
Now, how exactly did this happen?

11:32.908 --> 11:37.345
I moved up for the goal
and had a side kick right in the net.

11:37.546 --> 11:40.174
And as soon as my foot
touched the ball...

11:40.416 --> 11:41.678
...I heard a crack.

11:41.884 --> 11:43.977
Then I went to take a step...

11:44.854 --> 11:47.789
...and it just gave out
and started hurting.

11:48.324 --> 11:51.555
Did you collide with anybody?
Anybody fall on top of you?

11:51.761 --> 11:54.025
- No.
- Anybody kick you in the shin?

11:54.730 --> 11:57.198
No. All I did was kick the ball.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.925
- What's wrong?
- It's a severe break.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.161
I want to understand how it happened.

12:02.371 --> 12:05.101
We're gonna get you
some more pain medication.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.003
And we're gonna run some tests.
All right?

12:08.210 --> 12:10.440
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:14.617 --> 12:15.641
Did you see that?

12:15.851 --> 12:18.547
The bone looked like
it exploded from the inside.

12:18.754 --> 12:21.848
- I want a CT-guided needle biopsy.
- Tumor?

12:22.057 --> 12:24.890
Remotely possible it's an infection.
The parents?

12:25.094 --> 12:27.324
One of the soccer moms
is calling them.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.623
We need their consent for the biopsy.

12:33.369 --> 12:35.064
You have a call on 35.

12:35.271 --> 12:38.798
A Mr. Davidson from some
insurance company calling you back.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.202
What is this?

12:40.409 --> 12:42.934
- They found it in the copy room.
- It's not mine.

12:43.145 --> 12:45.045
- It has your name on it.
- Thanks.

12:45.247 --> 12:47.272
He has the same coverage I have.

12:48.451 --> 12:49.975
No insurance covers it?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.518
So if I needed them,
you wouldn't buy them?

12:53.055 --> 12:55.182
Well, that's not acceptable.
Listen...

12:56.358 --> 12:58.417
Can I speak
to your superior, please?

12:59.628 --> 13:02.563
Fine! Fine! I'll call him back.

13:02.832 --> 13:04.231
Problem, Peter?

13:05.401 --> 13:07.528
Just bureaucracy. Drives you crazy.

13:07.736 --> 13:10.034
So I'm supposed to treat
this knife wound?

13:10.239 --> 13:13.834
It's not just a knife wound.
No hurry, I gave him five of Haldol.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.706
We got a hostage crisis and shootout.
They'll need a triage officer.

13:17.913 --> 13:21.041
They'd want someone more experienced.
I start tomorrow.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.549
- The rush is the best part.
- Maybe we'll see you on TV.

13:24.753 --> 13:27.722
- A shootout?
- Yeah, Wild West. How about it, doc?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.720
Tell Dr. Weaver that
I'm going on a run.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.425
800, 850...

13:35.631 --> 13:38.191
...$920.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.630
Malik, could I ask you a question?

13:40.836 --> 13:43.737
- Which do you think is the better vein?
- Let's see.

13:44.306 --> 13:46.467
- That's the one. Big and straight.
- Okay.

13:46.675 --> 13:48.905
Just slide it in.
He can't feel anything.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.774
It's going in.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.011
Got a flash. I'm advancing.

13:56.218 --> 13:59.483
Sapphire pinkie ring?
This man ain't got no class.

13:59.688 --> 14:01.451
Hooked up the line.

14:01.957 --> 14:03.891
Got the tape.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.327
How come it's not running in?

14:14.637 --> 14:15.626
It's infiltrated.

14:15.838 --> 14:18.773
- You went through the vein.
- No, I was really careful.

14:18.974 --> 14:21.204
You gotta be kind of
Zen with it, okay?

14:21.410 --> 14:24.004
Now, watch the master, okay?

14:24.780 --> 14:28.443
It's not about seeing.
It's not about feeling.

14:28.651 --> 14:30.346
It's about knowing.

14:30.553 --> 14:32.748
Malik, you got a phone call in Admit.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.388
- It's in.
- Okay.

14:34.590 --> 14:35.989
Now, finish it up.

14:36.191 --> 14:37.818
I'll take it out there.

14:38.027 --> 14:39.051
- Okay?
- Yep.

14:39.261 --> 14:41.229
Now, keep an eye on this guy too.

14:42.231 --> 14:45.530
When you finish, there's a
head lac to irrigate in Curtain 2.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.125
Wow!

14:48.337 --> 14:52.569
Oh, the knife tip is posterior
to the uvula and the oropharynx.

14:54.376 --> 14:56.844
So everything under control in here?

14:57.379 --> 14:58.505
It's fine.

14:59.682 --> 15:02.446
I asked Malik for some help
with the IV.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.778
Good. Use the nurses.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.118
That's an important lesson.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.567
We exchanged gunfire.
The assailant is down.

15:20.769 --> 15:22.930
- Bomb squad's checking him.
- Bomb squad?

15:23.138 --> 15:25.971
He took four employees hostage
with explosives.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.075
- What's his problem?
- He works here.

15:28.277 --> 15:29.676
Guess he didn't like it.

15:30.112 --> 15:32.546
The docs are here. How's he doing?

15:32.748 --> 15:36.548
<i>The guy's covered in dynamite.</i>
<i>Got chicken wire all over his body.</i>

15:36.752 --> 15:38.879
<i>Lots of blood coming out of his neck.</i>

15:39.088 --> 15:41.147
- How long's he been down?
- Ten minutes.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.723
- Can we get in?
- When we clear the explosives.

15:43.926 --> 15:45.985
Clark, can I send a doc in there?

15:46.795 --> 15:51.095
<i>Well, I've cut the main fuse.</i>
<i>But it's not safe without a 7B suit.</i>

15:51.300 --> 15:52.858
- What's that?
- A bomb suit.

15:53.068 --> 15:55.229
- Put me in that thing.
- Wait a minute.

15:55.437 --> 15:58.270
If anyone goes, it should be you.
You're the doctor.

15:58.474 --> 16:01.773
I'm not pressuring you.
If he dies, it wouldn't ruin my day.

16:01.977 --> 16:04.275
But it just looks bad
on the evening news.

16:04.747 --> 16:05.907
Sure. I'll go in.

16:06.248 --> 16:09.581
Jeanie, hey.
That was Pathology about Dana.

16:09.785 --> 16:12.982
Full workup will take a while.
Looks like Ewing's sarcoma.

16:13.188 --> 16:15.679
- Lf you want to beg off...
- No, I want to help.

16:15.891 --> 16:16.858
Good.

16:17.092 --> 16:19.492
Female, 77, found unconscious
in her home.

16:19.695 --> 16:23.825
Her name is Emily Holmes. She says
she has very good health coverage.

16:24.033 --> 16:26.627
We found her with BP 90/60, pulse 120.

16:26.835 --> 16:28.860
Started a line.
She arrested en route.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.868
- History?
- No meds in the bathroom.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.064
Does she have any medical problems?

16:33.275 --> 16:37.109
I'm just her neighbor. She always
seemed all right. Just forgetful.

16:37.813 --> 16:40.611
Let's get her on a monitor,
7.5 ET tube.

16:40.816 --> 16:45.412
There were three newspapers at her
door, so I knew something was wrong.

16:45.621 --> 16:46.610
All right, I'm in.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.183
Bag her.

16:48.791 --> 16:49.917
Full compressions.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.685
- V-fib, no pulse.
- Charge, 200.

16:52.895 --> 16:54.886
Is she dead? What's happening?

16:55.197 --> 16:56.687
- Can I help?
- Everyone clear.

16:56.899 --> 16:57.991
Clear.

17:00.069 --> 17:01.627
Sinus tach.

17:03.672 --> 17:06.266
I got a pulse.
Why do you think she arrested?

17:06.474 --> 17:10.741
Could've had an MI. Could be septic,
hypoxic, electrolyte imbalance.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.503
BP's 90 palp.

17:12.748 --> 17:15.876
Let's start her on dopamine.
Let's get a 12-lead.

17:16.085 --> 17:20.181
- She's not out of the woods yet.
- Does that mean she's gonna die?

17:20.589 --> 17:23.114
That's a possibility.
Do you know her family?

17:23.325 --> 17:25.520
I never saw anyone come to see her.

17:25.728 --> 17:29.721
I only ask because my sister's
on a waiting list...

17:29.932 --> 17:32.457
...for an apartment in the building.

17:33.969 --> 17:37.996
I don't really understand why
a biopsy was done for a broken leg.

17:38.207 --> 17:42.507
The fracture didn't match what Dana
said had happened. It seemed unusual.

17:42.945 --> 17:46.244
- How?
- It may have been caused by a tumor.

17:46.882 --> 17:49.214
- A tumor?
- It weakened the bone.

17:49.418 --> 17:50.817
We have more tests...

17:51.019 --> 17:54.648
...but the biopsy showed blue cells,
malignant cells.

17:54.857 --> 17:56.518
Are you saying she has cancer?

17:56.725 --> 17:59.250
Everything is still
in the diagnostic stage.

17:59.461 --> 18:00.928
You're not certain, then.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.621
The indication is that
there is a sarcoma.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.925
So you should speak
with an oncologist.

18:06.135 --> 18:07.932
Oh, no. I don't believe this.

18:08.137 --> 18:09.604
Oh, here she is.

18:10.038 --> 18:11.437
Hey, honey.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.039
How are you feeling?

18:13.242 --> 18:16.268
Did you hear how it happened?
It was so stupid.

18:16.478 --> 18:18.742
I'm sure you played a hard game.

18:20.916 --> 18:22.383
How much longer?

18:22.751 --> 18:25.777
With detonators,
all this damn wire...

18:25.988 --> 18:27.717
I hate amateurs.

18:28.090 --> 18:30.684
The wacko must have spent
hours wrapping this.

18:31.894 --> 18:36.922
Oh, God, his guts! His guts
are coming out under this stuff.

18:37.132 --> 18:40.192
Don't cut any more, okay?
That's small intestine.

18:40.669 --> 18:42.660
It's all wrapped up in the wire.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.429
His pulse is getting weaker.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.041
We gotta get him to the ER.
Is that black box a bomb?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.072
I got rid of the dynamite.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.975
Let's be safe and wrap it
in a ballistic blanket.

18:53.182 --> 18:55.707
If it blows,
no one gets hurt except Boris.

18:55.918 --> 18:58.614
Zadro, get the gurney down here now.

18:58.821 --> 19:00.288
<i>We're moving him out.</i>

19:01.323 --> 19:04.815
Dr. Olivas said that with these
digital hearing aids...

19:05.027 --> 19:08.554
...he'll be able to understand
and talk as well as you and I.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.124
So he won't be deaf?

19:10.332 --> 19:13.529
His residual hearing
is something that we can work with.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.396
If he does the treatment...

19:17.005 --> 19:19.667
...twice a week for an hour.
One of us has to be with him.

19:20.209 --> 19:21.972
- I can do that.
- Well, so can I.

19:22.177 --> 19:25.840
This treatment...
It's natural hearing input.

19:26.048 --> 19:29.506
The more we talk to him,
the better his speech will develop.

19:30.185 --> 19:33.712
You're gonna be okay, honey.
Hear that? You're gonna be okay.

19:34.022 --> 19:35.580
- Of course he is.
- Yeah.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.855
There is one thing, though.
This hearing aid is expensive...

19:40.062 --> 19:41.927
...and my insurance won't cover it.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.529
Why won't they?

19:43.732 --> 19:46.200
If no one's covered,
neither are the elderly.

19:46.401 --> 19:48.869
Oh, that's so low.

19:49.071 --> 19:51.164
Yeah. I hate asking this...

19:52.374 --> 19:56.504
...but it's $5000 and I've only got
$2700 in the bank. So I was...

19:56.712 --> 20:00.808
Peter, I said that we share everything
and I meant everything, okay?

20:01.683 --> 20:05.676
It means we share everything.
Don't worry about it.

20:05.888 --> 20:08.288
Just be happy that
something can be done.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.021
Okay?

20:17.399 --> 20:20.698
PH, 7.32.
PO-2, 345 on 100 percent.

20:20.903 --> 20:23.497
Good. Good.
Turn it down to 50 percent.

20:23.705 --> 20:26.071
- Check another gas in a half an hour.
- Okay.

20:26.275 --> 20:29.210
- Is this Emily Holmes?
- Yes.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.108
John Carter.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.611
She was found in her apartment.

20:33.815 --> 20:38.047
Margo Aikin. I authorize admissions
for Blue Beacon, her HMO.

20:38.253 --> 20:39.686
This lady's a DNR.

20:43.692 --> 20:47.389
She came in full arrest. She didn't
have any papers or any family.

20:47.596 --> 20:49.427
Let's step outside.

20:51.033 --> 20:54.093
I don't know what your plans are,
but I can't admit her.

20:54.303 --> 20:55.668
This patient's critical.

20:55.871 --> 20:59.500
Dr. Carter, I can't justify
an expenditure of $5000 a day...

20:59.708 --> 21:03.542
...on a patient who should not be
alive, does not want to be alive.

21:03.745 --> 21:06.942
I wasn't gonna let her die.
That's not what we do here.

21:07.149 --> 21:09.140
Her choice was not to be resuscitated.

21:09.384 --> 21:12.319
It's in the HMO file.
That's the guideline I follow.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.614
She's on a vent.
You have to take her.

21:15.424 --> 21:16.914
No, I don't.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.286
You tubed her. You take her.

21:25.867 --> 21:26.891
Four units O-neg.

21:27.102 --> 21:30.128
- What's his airway?
- Intubated in the field.

21:31.039 --> 21:34.270
- Hey, what's going on?
- GSW. Bomb squad is coming with him.

21:34.609 --> 21:35.598
Bomb squad?

21:35.811 --> 21:37.506
This the guy with the dynamite?

21:37.713 --> 21:39.112
- Should be safe.
- "Should"?

21:39.314 --> 21:42.511
- Gunshot wound to neck and abdomen.
- BP was 100 palp.

21:42.718 --> 21:46.484
Very gently on my count:
One, two, three...

21:48.056 --> 21:50.616
Open this blanket nice and easy.

21:53.662 --> 21:58.031
Eviscerated bowel. CBC, chem panel,
coag, type and cross for four.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.997
- Gram of cefotetan.
- Pressure's down to 85 systolic.

22:01.203 --> 22:03.330
- I'll throw in a subclavian.
- You want O-neg?

22:03.538 --> 22:04.698
Yeah. Two units.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.898
Bowel's wrapped around
this chicken wire. What is this?

22:08.110 --> 22:10.670
May be a detonator.
I won't know till it's open.

22:11.546 --> 22:13.741
- Can it go off?
- Lf there's a blasting cap.

22:13.949 --> 22:15.348
Just don't mess with it.

22:15.550 --> 22:17.814
Jeanie, let's irrigate
with some saline.

22:18.020 --> 22:21.854
Let's get some sterile lap pads.
Come on. Oh, man!

22:22.057 --> 22:23.957
We'll resect this mess in the O.R.

22:24.159 --> 22:25.490
You're coming with us.

22:25.694 --> 22:28.288
Someone get some scrubs
for Officer Clark.

22:28.497 --> 22:30.590
- Okay, I'm in. Hook me up.
- Pulse ox 98.

22:30.799 --> 22:34.394
- Let me get this under there.
- Come on. Clean it out. Good.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.071
It's shorting!
You got about five seconds!

22:37.439 --> 22:40.931
Everybody out of here!
Out! Now! Let's go!

22:41.176 --> 22:44.942
2000, 3000, 4000...

22:59.394 --> 23:02.727
All right! We've got
an open bowel in here!

23:03.098 --> 23:06.261
Let's move, people!
Let's get him up to the O.R.!

23:06.468 --> 23:08.663
- I got the line.
- O.R. 2 is ready.

23:10.505 --> 23:11.494
There you go.

23:11.706 --> 23:15.142
So this is shrimp?
And what's the red shredded stuff?

23:15.343 --> 23:16.674
That's Maui onions.

23:16.878 --> 23:19.745
- No pepperoni, cheese, tomatoes?
- It's gourmet.

23:19.948 --> 23:24.681
The bomber spoiled my gourmet lunch.
So the heroics give you an appetite?

23:24.886 --> 23:28.947
Oh, no. The running from
the Trauma Room gave me an appetite.

23:30.792 --> 23:33.022
- What is this lunch about?
- Yeah.

23:33.228 --> 23:36.026
All right. Okay. First a reading.

23:36.264 --> 23:41.258
"Performance Review, Dr. Douglas Ross,
by Kerry Weaver, M.D."

23:41.736 --> 23:45.069
- Where did you get that?
- It was found in the copying machine.

23:45.273 --> 23:48.299
"Dr. Ross repeatedly demonstrates
a complete disregard...

23:48.510 --> 23:50.410
...for policies and procedures.

23:50.712 --> 23:53.875
For example, in regard
to patient discharge..." Wait.

23:54.082 --> 23:57.381
Okay. "In spite of mandatory
counseling to correct a history...

23:57.586 --> 23:59.451
...of disrupting workplace behavior...

23:59.654 --> 24:02.885
...Dr. Ross exhibits ongoing problems
with impulse control."

24:03.091 --> 24:05.616
That's right, Kerry. I'm a psycho.

24:05.827 --> 24:09.092
She could've given that
to the Pedes Review Committee.

24:09.297 --> 24:11.857
It's too late.
I brought you here...

24:12.067 --> 24:16.595
...because I wanted you to toast
the new Pedes ER Attending: Me.

24:17.672 --> 24:18.661
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.434
A buddy on the committee
told me at 6:00 a.m.

24:21.843 --> 24:24.937
I'm approved.
They're telling Anspaugh right now.

24:25.147 --> 24:27.809
I am so proud of you.
I am so thrilled.

24:28.016 --> 24:29.643
Aren't you thrilled?

24:31.153 --> 24:33.383
He's got his doubts
a little bit, right?

24:33.655 --> 24:37.716
Whatever my doubts were,
in all honesty...

24:37.993 --> 24:41.156
...I'm very happy for you.
Happy for both of you.

24:45.867 --> 24:48.165
Mark, Rachel's here.
She wants to see you.

24:48.603 --> 24:49.831
Sure.

24:52.174 --> 24:53.937
She seems a little upset.

24:55.043 --> 24:56.067
Honey, what's up?

24:56.278 --> 24:59.611
Dad, can you come outside?
There's sort of a problem.

25:00.115 --> 25:02.174
He was ill when we left Vermillion.

25:02.384 --> 25:05.046
We got a rodeo in Louisville
8:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

25:05.253 --> 25:08.188
It's colic for sure.
I ain't seen a load in 12 hours.

25:08.757 --> 25:12.352
Don't worry. My dad can help you.
He's a doctor.

25:12.561 --> 25:13.858
Honey, I'm not a vet.

25:14.396 --> 25:18.196
Last time he got impacted,
mineral oil enema did the trick.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.860
We don't have the facilities to treat
animals, but we can find you a vet.

25:23.438 --> 25:27.738
Nearest large-animal is in
Buffalo Grove. Two hours in traffic.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.104
Dad, we gotta help him. Please?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.771
He's one of the finest
roping horses there is.

25:36.384 --> 25:39.979
Poor thing. If he goes down
in the trailer, he could die.

25:40.188 --> 25:42.850
That's right, miss. He sure could.

25:43.391 --> 25:45.018
That would be tragic.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.624
What's his name?

25:46.828 --> 25:49.160
Cherry Blossom. Say hi, Cherry.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.729
Hi, Cherry.

25:51.199 --> 25:54.225
Don't worry.
My dad's gonna make you all better.

25:55.570 --> 25:58.937
It's clean. No money in tobacco,
polluting chemicals, mining.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.438
It's like charity.
But it's an investment.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.907
- It's a White Hat Fund.
- What's the return?

26:04.112 --> 26:07.343
Over the past five years
it's been about 7.9 percent.

26:07.549 --> 26:10.279
You got anything dirtier
with a better upside?

26:10.485 --> 26:11.452
Sure, here you go.

26:11.686 --> 26:14.951
Pure petrochemicals:
17.4 percent return.

26:15.156 --> 26:19.115
Dr. Carter? My toe is feeling
so much better since you retaped it.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.818
- Good.
- Why don't we get together sometime?

26:22.030 --> 26:25.295
Maybe a little hot talk
about dollar-cost averaging...

26:25.500 --> 26:28.094
I'm really not much
of a customer these days.

26:28.303 --> 26:30.203
This isn't really a sales pitch.

26:30.405 --> 26:31.736
You work out?

26:33.174 --> 26:36.803
- Yeah, when I can find the time.
- Well, it's hard to find the time.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.947
I get free passes at the Artemis Club.

26:40.148 --> 26:43.845
It's good for a workout and sauna.
I'm there every night about 7.

26:44.052 --> 26:46.452
- Thanks. You careful with your toe?
- Yeah.

26:46.655 --> 26:49.920
I exercycle, light weights.
Great therapy after a hard day.

26:50.125 --> 26:53.993
It's much more fun when someone else
is there. It makes the time fly.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.293
Well, today is not really
a good day for me.

26:57.666 --> 27:00.601
- But some other time. I'll come by.
- Whenever.

27:00.802 --> 27:02.963
- He's not moving any air.
- Pulse ox 88.

27:03.171 --> 27:06.299
- Gotta tube him. How much you weigh?
- 260.

27:06.508 --> 27:08.738
Yosh, 180 of ketamine, 180 of sux.

27:08.943 --> 27:10.501
Conni, 8.0 ET.

27:10.745 --> 27:11.734
I can't breathe.

27:11.946 --> 27:14.608
We need to put a tube
in your throat to help you.

27:14.816 --> 27:17.444
We'll give you medicine
to make you sleep.

27:17.652 --> 27:19.313
- Meds onboard.
- Put him down.

27:19.521 --> 27:20.920
We need a vent in here.

27:21.122 --> 27:24.489
- I need suction.
- Pulse ox is falling. Eighty-five.

27:24.826 --> 27:27.454
I don't really need this distraction.

27:27.662 --> 27:29.755
Yosh, give me cricoid pressure.

27:32.033 --> 27:33.796
Damn! I can't see the cords.

27:36.538 --> 27:40.599
Bag him! Conni, give me a number
four Mackintosh. His neck's too big.

27:40.809 --> 27:43.778
- Pulse ox 89.
- We don't have a number four blade.

27:43.978 --> 27:46.845
- Anesthesia will have one.
- He's paralyzed.

27:47.115 --> 27:50.016
Yeah, keep bagging him.
His pulse ox is up to 90.

27:50.218 --> 27:51.651
Dr. Greene?

27:51.853 --> 27:54.549
They sent this down from Surgery.
Can I keep it?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.917
Keep it here. The cops will want it.

27:57.125 --> 27:59.958
- How's it going?
- Weaver's having trouble intubating.

28:00.161 --> 28:01.753
Needs a bigger blade.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.128
- Everything okay?
- Status asthmaticus, needs intubation.

28:09.337 --> 28:11.498
Bull neck.
I need a number four blade.

28:11.706 --> 28:15.164
- Mind if I take a look?
- You'll deprive him of oxygen, Mark.

28:20.582 --> 28:23.107
Okay. Yeah, you're right.
It's a tough one.

28:23.551 --> 28:25.985
- Yosh, cricoid pressure.
- We tried that.

28:26.388 --> 28:28.913
Pulse ox is falling. Get out, Mark.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.116
Backwards, upwards, to the right.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.059
I can see.

28:34.262 --> 28:35.559
Good. Okay, I'm in.

28:37.065 --> 28:38.191
Bag him.

28:39.801 --> 28:44.170
Don't let them bag him too fast.
He's got a long expiratory phase.

28:45.774 --> 28:46.763
- You Dr. Weaver?
- Yes.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.806
Can you sign off on this order?

28:49.010 --> 28:51.638
- You put the copier back?
- It's not going back in.

28:51.846 --> 28:54.144
They're converting it
to a Pediatric Exam.

28:54.349 --> 28:57.614
See? We're taking out a wall.
It'll look real good.

28:58.186 --> 28:59.414
Thank you.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.717
- Dr. Weaver?
- What do you want?

29:01.923 --> 29:05.518
- About that patient in Trauma 1...
- Why is she here? We need the bed.

29:05.727 --> 29:08.924
I tried to get her admitted
to the unit but she's a DNR.

29:09.130 --> 29:11.121
Her HMO won't authorize admission.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.563
She can't stay in the ER.
Get her admitted or transfer her.

29:14.769 --> 29:17.363
She's intubated.
She's not stable for transfer.

29:17.572 --> 29:21.440
You want to be Chief Resident,
don't come to me when things go wrong.

29:21.643 --> 29:25.101
Deal with this yourself.
Improve your problem-solving skills.

29:25.313 --> 29:27.713
Randi, get me Dr. Anspaugh!

29:38.927 --> 29:40.360
Hello, Peter.

29:40.762 --> 29:41.854
Hey.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.890
I suppose we should talk.

29:46.835 --> 29:49.360
Elizabeth, this isn't
a good time for me.

29:49.838 --> 29:52.932
Yeah, I know. It's been a rough day.

29:53.141 --> 29:54.972
The bomber and...

29:57.312 --> 29:59.712
I'd like to get
something out in the open.

29:59.914 --> 30:02.348
I know it's not been easy
being with me.

30:02.550 --> 30:06.316
But if it's not working out, and
if you and Carla are back together...

30:06.521 --> 30:09.081
...I'd appreciate hearing it from you.

30:09.624 --> 30:12.525
What? What are you...?

30:14.262 --> 30:16.526
It's got nothing to do with that.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.961
You've been avoiding me.
What's happened?

30:19.167 --> 30:22.034
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm dealing with some things.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.932
Well, what things? What is it?

30:29.143 --> 30:31.168
Reece is hearing-impaired.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.314
- How bad?
- He's profoundly deaf.

30:36.651 --> 30:38.380
Peter, I'm so sorry.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.789
I didn't tell you about it...

30:44.292 --> 30:45.691
...because it's private.

30:47.362 --> 30:50.661
I haven't been avoiding you.
It's just that, you know what?

30:51.633 --> 30:54.067
I don't know how to talk about that.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.833
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.

31:01.743 --> 31:03.142
How's he doing, Rachel?

31:03.344 --> 31:04.675
He's okay.

31:04.879 --> 31:06.972
You been around horses much?

31:07.181 --> 31:08.808
Sure got a way with them.

31:09.017 --> 31:11.508
Keep him still.
I'm gonna put the tube in.

31:11.719 --> 31:13.584
If you can hold the tail just...

31:16.090 --> 31:17.887
Easy. Easy, boy.

31:19.928 --> 31:22.055
Good. Tube's in.

31:23.531 --> 31:26.625
Jerry, why don't you go ahead
and squeeze the lavage bag?

31:26.834 --> 31:28.768
I'm not gonna get kicked, am I?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.871
No. He's as sweet as they come.

31:32.173 --> 31:35.506
Nice and easy. Don't worry, boy.
We're not gonna hurt you.

31:35.710 --> 31:37.575
Nothing's gonna shoot out, is it?

31:37.779 --> 31:40.475
No, it shouldn't.
You know, not for a while.

31:41.115 --> 31:43.083
Okay. Here goes.

31:43.284 --> 31:44.979
Nice and easy.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.642
Good.

31:47.388 --> 31:49.015
Nice, even flow.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.624
Hey. How you doing?

31:55.663 --> 31:57.426
What's an oncologist?

31:57.632 --> 32:00.863
He's a doctor that deals
with abnormal cell growth.

32:01.069 --> 32:02.696
He's a cancer doctor?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.505
Why can't you be honest with me?

32:09.677 --> 32:13.044
My parents were talking
to an oncologist outside the room.

32:14.115 --> 32:15.776
He said something about...

32:16.884 --> 32:18.112
...amputation.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.981
They're with him right now.

32:21.422 --> 32:25.188
There were indications in your biopsy.
You may have a tumor.

32:30.231 --> 32:32.222
That means they'll cut off my leg?

32:35.303 --> 32:39.262
The specialists will look at their
options and then make a decision.

32:40.642 --> 32:42.303
Stop ducking my questions!

32:43.311 --> 32:44.938
Can't you be honest?

32:45.913 --> 32:47.073
All right.

32:48.282 --> 32:49.510
Okay.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.144
Amputation offers us the best choice.

32:52.353 --> 32:55.584
I don't want to live without my leg.
I'd rather be dead.

32:55.790 --> 32:59.157
When they finish diagnosis,
they'll talk about all treatments.

32:59.661 --> 33:01.788
Treatments that could save my leg?

33:02.597 --> 33:04.792
The kind of tumor that you have...

33:06.534 --> 33:09.230
...amputation offers us
the best chance.

33:13.441 --> 33:15.671
If they amputate...

33:16.244 --> 33:17.836
...is it certain I'll live?

33:20.314 --> 33:21.303
No.

33:24.285 --> 33:26.344
But it's your best shot, kiddo.

33:28.990 --> 33:33.359
If you were my daughter,
I would try to persuade you to do it.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.657
Would you still do it if I said no?

33:43.738 --> 33:45.433
We get all the facts.

33:46.607 --> 33:50.475
It's a decision you and your
parents will have to make together.

33:56.484 --> 33:57.644
Okay?

34:01.522 --> 34:04.548
You have power of attorney
for over 700 clients?

34:05.359 --> 34:07.452
So you've never actually even met her?

34:08.663 --> 34:09.789
Yes.

34:10.831 --> 34:14.199
Yeah, any information that you...
Could you fax it over?

34:14.569 --> 34:16.935
I guess that's what we'll do.

34:17.371 --> 34:18.929
Thank you very much.

34:20.742 --> 34:22.402
Everything okay, Carter?

34:23.411 --> 34:25.436
Yeah, I intubated a DNR patient.

34:25.646 --> 34:29.172
HMO won't admit her, no family,
only a lawyer with durable power.

34:29.382 --> 34:31.214
And he's never even met her.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.481
- What are you thinking about?
- I don't know.

34:35.123 --> 34:39.389
I mean, should I extubate?
It just seems kind of wrong.

34:39.594 --> 34:42.027
DNR means she did not
want heroic measures.

34:42.295 --> 34:45.663
The real question is whether or not
you're ready to do it.

34:47.268 --> 34:49.532
- Have you ever done it?
- Yeah, once.

34:49.737 --> 34:51.329
But I had family support.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.054
Vitals are stable, pulse ox 98.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.985
I weaned her off the dopamine.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.683
I'm going to turn off the vent.

35:13.895 --> 35:15.419
Do an apnea test.

35:15.630 --> 35:18.929
- Should I get an Attending?
- I already talked to Dr. Greene.

35:20.334 --> 35:21.926
She's a DNR.

35:24.505 --> 35:26.097
She didn't want this.

35:40.988 --> 35:44.947
- Spontaneous respiration.
- Just one breath. That might be it.

35:46.994 --> 35:50.020
No, she's breathing on her own.
I'm gonna extubate.

36:12.987 --> 36:15.285
Let's give her five liters of oxygen.

36:23.197 --> 36:26.928
Hey, any luck?
Dr. Greene wants an enema update.

36:27.134 --> 36:29.068
No. No movement yet.

36:29.303 --> 36:32.329
I'm learning all about
taking care of horses.

36:32.773 --> 36:36.174
It might not hurt to let him out
a bit, let him walk around.

36:36.377 --> 36:38.208
Movement's good for colic.

36:38.946 --> 36:42.245
You want to get in and give him a pat?
Help me ease him out?

36:43.851 --> 36:46.445
I don't have any experience
with horses.

36:46.654 --> 36:48.781
I never even touched one before today.

36:48.990 --> 36:51.322
You'll be fine.
Just don't show any fear.

36:51.525 --> 36:54.016
And don't worry about
showing him who's boss.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.286
Come on, Blossom.

36:57.498 --> 37:00.194
You got all these nice folks
concerned about you.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.699
Come on. Come on.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.699
Come on. Come on, good boy.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.449
Hey, now! You brought us
some good luck, son.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.450
Hey, Mark.

37:20.688 --> 37:21.985
Can we talk?

37:22.189 --> 37:25.716
- I was going out to see the horse.
- Yeah, it's important.

37:25.927 --> 37:27.326
What's up, Kerry?

37:27.662 --> 37:29.254
Let's go in the lounge.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.161
Did you know Doug Ross
was made a Pedes Attending?

37:34.368 --> 37:37.701
That they're fixing up
a suite of rooms for him?

37:38.039 --> 37:39.529
Yeah. He told me at lunch.

37:40.541 --> 37:43.840
Really? Oh.
Well, I was told by the painters.

37:44.045 --> 37:47.537
I had to read it on a work form.
What's going on around here?

37:48.115 --> 37:51.380
- What do you mean?
- Why was I left out of the loop?

37:51.585 --> 37:56.079
Kerry, Ross is the new Pedes
ER Attending. That's a fact of life.

37:56.557 --> 37:59.720
We should learn to accept it
and move on, okay?

38:00.061 --> 38:02.256
Wait a minute.
How can I "move on"...

38:02.463 --> 38:07.025
...when you express disfavor about
Ross as an Attending to my face...

38:07.234 --> 38:10.829
...and then celebrate his dubious
achievement behind my back?

38:11.038 --> 38:14.804
- Is this really about Ross?
- Yes. Yes, it's about Ross.

38:15.009 --> 38:19.378
- I don't think he's qualified.
- The hospital doesn't agree.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.070
You're not angry about him.

38:21.282 --> 38:23.773
This is about you
obsessing over a silly title.

38:24.318 --> 38:25.842
Make a decision, Kerry.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.817
You want to be a doctor
or an administrator?

38:29.457 --> 38:31.425
I'm gonna go examine a horse.

38:35.129 --> 38:39.088
I finished my write-ups on the chest
pain and the altered mental status.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.860
I need you to cosign
these charts before I go.

38:42.636 --> 38:43.728
Yeah.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.833
Those PVCs?

38:49.744 --> 38:50.972
That's right.

38:51.612 --> 38:53.637
Shouldn't we give something for that?

38:55.816 --> 38:56.805
No.

38:58.452 --> 38:59.817
V-tach!

39:00.254 --> 39:01.448
You shock that, right?

39:04.592 --> 39:05.650
Not this time.

39:15.469 --> 39:17.460
Watch. V-tach...

39:19.540 --> 39:20.768
...V- fib...

39:22.309 --> 39:24.004
...then asystole.

39:25.413 --> 39:27.813
She's not suffering.
It's what she wanted.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.197
I'll sign those charts now.

40:00.481 --> 40:04.247
Dr. Ross? You spoke to
our daughter about treatment.

40:04.452 --> 40:06.682
She's very upset.
Why would you do that?

40:06.887 --> 40:09.014
Why did you advise against amputation?

40:09.223 --> 40:12.624
I didn't advise against it.
I said it was her best chance.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.990
But you gave her other alternatives.
We want her to live.

40:16.464 --> 40:19.456
So do I. But she has to accept
what'll happen to her...

40:19.667 --> 40:22.727
...not end up fighting some edict
that gets handed down.

40:22.937 --> 40:25.269
- This is our decision, not hers.
- She's 15.

40:25.473 --> 40:29.204
She's old enough to be involved
in decisions about her own health.

40:30.111 --> 40:31.169
Stay away from her.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.114
You don't speak to her again.
Understood?

40:35.382 --> 40:38.044
All right.
To survive, she needs your support.

40:38.252 --> 40:41.881
She has to feel that you are working
for her, not against her.

40:44.258 --> 40:45.316
Let's go.

40:50.998 --> 40:51.987
Yeah.

40:52.199 --> 40:55.999
On the search committee for chief,
have you set the days for meetings?

40:56.203 --> 40:59.001
Yes. I was sorry to get
your message this morning...

40:59.206 --> 41:01.333
...that you won't have time
to participate.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.602
I've shifted some things around
and made some room.

41:04.812 --> 41:08.578
Really? We're getting together
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6 p.m.

41:08.782 --> 41:11.342
- Lf you can make it.
- I'd like to be involved.

41:11.585 --> 41:12.677
Good.

41:14.088 --> 41:15.612
I've lived in worse places.

41:15.823 --> 41:18.189
It just needs fresh paint,
some posters.

41:18.392 --> 41:21.190
I can live anywhere
as long as I've got music.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.989
- Sure you're up for this?
- I worked for Best Buy.

41:24.198 --> 41:27.326
I assembled systems all day long.
What have you got?

41:29.003 --> 41:30.595
Bose. Top of the line.

41:30.804 --> 41:32.931
This is a very expensive system.

41:33.140 --> 41:36.337
I guess these are the cables
that go with that?

41:36.544 --> 41:38.307
Actually, those are RCA cables.

41:38.512 --> 41:41.879
You must've hooked up
your VCR through your amplifier.

41:42.082 --> 41:45.210
I don't know. Some guy came over
and hooked it all up.

41:54.862 --> 41:56.955
You got a CD? We could try this out.

41:57.698 --> 41:59.063
Yeah, sure.

42:02.670 --> 42:04.433
"Jimmy Smith."

42:04.638 --> 42:06.196
- Jazz?
- Jazz.

42:06.407 --> 42:07.601
Organ.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.185
I like it.

42:23.090 --> 42:24.250
You know...

42:24.458 --> 42:28.588
...my doctor said
that slow dancing is okay.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.664
It might even be therapeutic.
