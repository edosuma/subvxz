00:05.839 --> 00:07.590
-[cell phone chimes]
-[chuckles]

00:09.592 --> 00:11.302
Mmm! "I love you." From P.

00:12.095 --> 00:12.929
Who’s P?

00:13.388 --> 00:15.849
Papito.  I text myself encouragements.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.354
I love you, too,  papito.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.818
Look at you, all in love
with your secret girlfriend.

00:26.901 --> 00:27.902
[cell phone chimes]

00:29.279 --> 00:31.865
[chuckles]

00:31.948 --> 00:33.491
You’re the one with the girlfriend.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.243
Yeah. [chuckles]

00:35.785 --> 00:38.246
Hey, come on, no phones at dinner.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.956
-[cell phone chimes]
-[chuckles]

00:42.417 --> 00:44.836
What? This could be Dr. Berkowitz.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.172
But you laughed.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.340
Leslie's jokes are not funny.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.344
Knock, knock. Who's there? Who cares?

00:55.096 --> 00:58.224
Well, he was nice enough
to let me come home early

00:58.308 --> 00:59.392
so we could eat together.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.769
He had plans, so it worked out.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.646
-Did he mention where he was going?
-I didn't ask.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.190
Did he mention who he was going with?

01:05.273 --> 01:06.816
Mami,  I don’t know.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.235
Why do you care anyway?
Aren’t you two just friends?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.071
Sí,  of course.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.865
Did he turn right or left
out of the parking lot?

01:16.534 --> 01:19.746
Just look at his Facebook.
He checks in everywhere.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.748
Last week, he checked in
at his attorney’s office

01:21.831 --> 01:24.209
and wrote, "Hashtag,
my daughter is suing me."

01:26.252 --> 01:28.880
Syd and I would never stalk each other
on social media.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.633
I don’t want to stalk him.

01:32.091 --> 01:35.220
I want to know exactly where he is
and follow him there.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.265
-Show me,  papito.
-Okay.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.893
He just checked in downtown at the opera.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.896
"Hashtag, just checked in
downtown at the opera."

01:46.940 --> 01:48.942
But I always accompany him to the opera.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.402
[scoffs]
It’s not like he took another woman!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.780
[all laugh]

01:53.863 --> 01:55.323
You think so?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.952
Mami,  no. Because that’s ridiculous.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.620
He probably took a family member.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.539
Yeah. Like his daughter, who is suing him.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
[speaking Spanish]

02:06.793 --> 02:09.003
[in English] He can take whoever he wants.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.588
Abuelita,  are you okay?

02:10.672 --> 02:11.923
I am fine,  papito.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.842
I am very, how do you say...

02:13.925 --> 02:17.178
Very chill.  ¡Carajo!

02:22.267 --> 02:23.852
Yeah. That ain’t chill.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.564
[theme song playing]

03:20.033 --> 03:21.701
I'm going to the opera.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.039
Mami,  really?
You’re gonna go spy on Dr. Berkowitz?

03:26.581 --> 03:27.665
How are you going to hide

03:27.749 --> 03:30.168
looking like the Latina
Breakfast at Tiffany's?

03:32.837 --> 03:35.924
I’m not wearing earrings.
He will never recognize me.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.469
My God,  Mami,  this is crazy.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.388
Also, opera tickets are expensive.
How are you gonna afford it?

03:43.139 --> 03:45.016
Hummer limo's downstairs.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.479
-She roped you into this?
-Are you kidding? I’m thrilled!

03:49.562 --> 03:52.815
My third stepmother used to take me
to the racetrack to spy on Father.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.026
For the longest time,
I thought she was saying,

03:55.109 --> 03:57.779
"Your father is with Rebecca, that horse!"

04:01.407 --> 04:02.784
I need to put on my lipstick.

04:03.743 --> 04:10.416
Okay. So your secret girlfriend is P...
Pearl? Patricia? Padmini?

04:10.500 --> 04:13.002
Ooh... Maybe P’s not a student.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.463
Mrs. Perez, the lunch lady?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.759
Yeah. I have a thing for hairnets
and tater breath.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.806
I am going to find out
who your secret girlfriend is.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.600
Papito,  if you have a secret girlfriend,
I need to know about it.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.436
Also, you're not allowed
to have a girlfriend or keep secrets.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.066
Hey, how are you and Max doing?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.276
[shushes] That's a secret.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.737
But, um... [clicks tongue]

04:40.905 --> 04:43.491
We doin’ real good. [chuckles]

04:43.574 --> 04:47.161
All right. So you guys exclusive?

04:47.245 --> 04:48.579
Yeah. Of course.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.540
I mean, I... Well, I think.

04:50.623 --> 04:54.377
I keep him pretty busy
with our regular once-a-week thing.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.587
Let me just check my calendar.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.465
Yep. There are seven days in a week.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.262
Yeah, but he doesn’t have time
to meet anybody else.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.930
He has a full-time job.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.599
-You met him at work, didn’t you?
-Why don't you shut up?

05:10.101 --> 05:10.935
[sighs]

05:11.019 --> 05:12.729
Is this something I should worry about?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.857
Max probably has women
throwing themselves at him.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.900
Can’t argue with you there.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.986
He could have anyone, but he chose you.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.491
Okay, I know that’s not the end
of that sentence.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.621
So, Schneider,
are you ready for the opera?

05:30.705 --> 05:33.416
You mean our secret spy mission, Lydia?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.294
The name is Bond.

05:36.377 --> 05:40.798
James Lydia Margarita del Carmen Inclan

05:40.882 --> 05:45.511
Maribona Leyte-Vidal de Riera Bond.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.724
[instruments tuning]

05:49.807 --> 05:50.641
Do you see him?

05:51.642 --> 05:52.894
No. Not yet.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.395
[gasps]

05:54.479 --> 05:55.855
What is it?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.190
I found him.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.858
He's sitting next to a woman!

05:58.941 --> 06:00.651
[gasps]

06:02.153 --> 06:03.237
What does she look like?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.656
Old. Very old.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.494
It's like someone wheeled in her coffin
and dumped her into her seat.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.582
Must be his mother.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.294
I'm glad there's nothing to worry about.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.505
Can we stay?
We haven’t even heard the fat lady sing.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.298
That's where that comes from.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.133
No!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.843
[stutters] What's happening?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.220
I was wrong.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.263
Leslie just took the hand
of a beautiful woman

06:29.347 --> 06:31.182
who was sitting on his other side.

06:31.265 --> 06:35.186
How dare he have other friends!

06:36.896 --> 06:39.524
It’s like I’m back at the racetrack
with my stepmom.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.193
What’s next?
Throw a mint julep in his face?

06:43.194 --> 06:47.532
I am going to grab him by the  aguacates...

06:50.409 --> 06:54.038
and feed them to that soprano!

06:56.332 --> 06:57.834
Not as fun. But I’m down.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.340
[Max moans softly]

07:05.133 --> 07:06.634
[chuckles] That's nice.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.097
Especially that. I came over here to talk.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.269
I want to talk about what’s going down.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.604
The sitch.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.065
Ya feelin’ me?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.485
-I would like to be.
-No! [laughs]

07:27.405 --> 07:29.657
I need to know
you're not sleeping with anyone else.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.536
Oh...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.249
Okay. [grunts]

07:39.083 --> 07:42.420
Yeah. We never really talked about it.
It's not a big deal. Whatever.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.838
But are you?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.051
-Yeah.
-[scoffs]

07:51.012 --> 07:52.013
Since when?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.306
Since last night.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.685
But don’t worry, we just cuddled.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.562
[shudders] That is so much worse!

08:00.771 --> 08:01.606
[sighs]

08:07.862 --> 08:08.905
This is Luna.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.573
[chuckles]

08:10.656 --> 08:13.367
She's hairy but pretty cute.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.996
I'm petsitting for my cousin
while she’s in Orlando.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.708
[scoffs] You really got me going there.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.919
I was about to go all psycho on you.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.795
I was looking to see
what I could set fire to.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.048
I had my eye on that football.
But it doesn’t matter.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.926
What’s important is
you’re not sleeping with anyone.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.302
Just me, myself and I.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.724
I still need to hear you say it, though.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.187
Penelope, I am not sleeping
with anyone else.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.233
And I’m really happy
you want to be exclusive.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.068
Ew.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.612
Do we have to call it that?

08:50.988 --> 08:54.075
That's what you want, right?
To be a couple?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.787
A couple of people
who don’t sleep with anyone else

08:57.870 --> 09:00.665
and don’t need labels! [chuckles]

09:00.748 --> 09:02.500
It’s still 45 minutes once a week.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.419
Ten minutes of blah, blah.
ten minutes of eats and drinks,

09:05.503 --> 09:07.880
five minutes of... [kisses]
fifteen minutes of... [grunting]

09:09.006 --> 09:10.591
And five minutes of "Where’s my bra?"

09:10.675 --> 09:11.509
Up top!

09:13.511 --> 09:14.345
Hey, Alex.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.223
You won’t tell us
who your secret girlfriend P is.

09:17.306 --> 09:21.143
So, we pulled up your Instagram
and narrowed it down to 15 possible girls.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.522
Incidentally, "15 possible girls"
would be a great name

09:24.605 --> 09:26.566
for a genderqueer punk band.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.949
I know she’s crazy, but, Syd, come on,
you’re better than this.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.326
Aw... I’m really not.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.413
-Is it her?
-No.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.998
-Is it her?
-No.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.251
-Is it her?
-That’s Selena Gomez! I wish.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.128
Me, too.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.215
What? I have a type.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.472
Wait, it didn’t occur to me until now,
but P could totally be a boy.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.766
[Alex sighs]

10:02.059 --> 10:06.147
Elena, I’ve been waiting
for the right time to tell you...

10:07.148 --> 10:08.190
but I’m straight.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.698
Feels good to say it out loud.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.411
Come on, Alex, let us help you.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.831
I mean, I made this happen.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.709
And I’m a girl, who likes girls,

10:26.792 --> 10:29.545
which means I know everything
there is to know about girls.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.005
[chuckles] I’ll say.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.423
Please don’t say.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.178
If I tell you some stuff,
can you leave me alone?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.347
I can't guarantee that, but spill!

10:40.139 --> 10:42.224
[sighs] Okay!

10:42.308 --> 10:43.476
Her name is Paige.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.853
She doesn’t go to our school,
she’s at St. Teresa’s,

10:45.936 --> 10:48.814
and... she’s left-handed

10:49.523 --> 10:51.067
and lactose intolerant.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.070
She seems interesting.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.822
She’s flawed
and she’s comfortable announcing it.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.949
-I like her.
-I like her, too.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.117
We like her.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.078
Oh, good, ‘cause I really cared.

11:03.454 --> 11:07.333
-Why have you been keeping her a secret?
-It's not respectful.

11:08.167 --> 11:13.172
Um... None of my friends like her
and I wish we could all hang out.

11:13.255 --> 11:17.635
So if you like her,
then who cares what other people think?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.430
What do you want, Alex?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.100
I want this to end.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.647
But I’d also like to keep seeing her.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.858
Then do what makes you happy.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.028
Thanks, guys. That actually does help.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.864
Great! Okay, now let’s plan
the perfect date.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.575
Look up left-handed-friendly restaurants
in Los Angeles.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.371
What are you doing?

11:45.454 --> 11:48.124
You said to do what makes me happy.
So, peace!

11:50.334 --> 11:53.921
I cannot believe
that Leslie is with that woman.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.799
And she is letting him
hold her hand like a...

11:57.383 --> 11:58.801
Dirty horse?

11:58.884 --> 12:02.138
[opera music playing]

12:02.221 --> 12:04.640
Let’s make him jealous.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.309
Dale,  put your arm around me.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.229
[laughs]

12:10.312 --> 12:11.564
Ay,  no!

12:14.358 --> 12:20.489
Now, I am going to drop my program
and you will check out my  fondillo.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.868
What’s a  fondillo...  Oh, there it is!

12:26.036 --> 12:29.957
-So, look for me. What are they doing now?
-Uh...

12:31.500 --> 12:33.544
Well, she’s letting go of his hand.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.798
Ooh, looks like
she’s heading for the bathroom.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.682
Wow!
She really hauled  fondillo  outta here.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.828
Nice shade.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.331
Is it Scarlet Sunrise?

13:10.414 --> 13:12.416
-Yes, it is.
-[chuckles softly]

13:12.500 --> 13:13.876
How did you know?

13:13.959 --> 13:17.755
-It is my shade. [laughs]
-Ah...

13:19.215 --> 13:21.675
I really like those heels.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.762
Marshalls.
Worth $50 but I got them for $10.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.016
Never pay full price for fabulous.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.813
So are you, eh...

13:35.231 --> 13:36.857
Are you here with your husband?

13:37.483 --> 13:41.028
On a date. With a very nice doctor.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.364
Ah... [chuckles]

13:43.447 --> 13:44.323
And you?

13:44.823 --> 13:49.662
A date, too, with a much younger man.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.497
Oh...

13:52.081 --> 13:54.708
-Good for you. Mmm.
-[chuckles]

13:54.792 --> 13:55.960
What does he do?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.714
Did I mention he is much younger?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.010
[sighs] I should get back.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.721
-Me, too. It was very nice meeting you.
-Mm-hmm.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.849
And what is your name?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.226
Esme.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.312
It was a pleasure to meet you, too...

14:15.396 --> 14:16.772
-Lydia!
-[gasps]

14:19.984 --> 14:21.068
How do you know my name?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.571
I know everything about you and Leslie!

14:23.654 --> 14:25.656
You're the wallpaper on his phone!

14:26.073 --> 14:28.951
I tried to make him delete it,
but neither of us knows how.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.458
Estúpido  smartphone.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.170
[in Spanish]
Wait a minute. You speak Spanish?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.047
[in Spanish] Of course. I’m Puerto Rican.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.382
And I'm Cuban!

14:43.465 --> 14:45.384
[exclaims] When did you arrive?

14:45.467 --> 14:48.971
In ‘62. [chuckles] What about you?

14:49.054 --> 14:50.431
In '74.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.640
That's great!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.267
[in English] I don’t like you.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.522
[in English] Well,
it seems Leslie has a type.

14:59.773 --> 15:04.904
I'm like the younger, taller,
more attractive version of you,

15:04.987 --> 15:07.072
who is smarter as well.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.828
Well, I look younger than you.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.415
And I feel taller than you.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.877
And after me, they broke the mold.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.714
It probably disintegrated with age.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.762
Leslie deserves better than you.
And that is me!

15:29.887 --> 15:32.389
Ah, you think so, huh?

15:32.473 --> 15:35.851
-[speaking Spanish]
-[gasping]

15:35.935 --> 15:38.979
-[cackles]
-[screaming]

15:42.107 --> 15:44.485
That shade has been discontinued!

15:44.568 --> 15:48.238
I know. I bought a case of it
before they sold out.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.698
-[exclaims]
-[laughs]

15:52.785 --> 15:58.040
Stay away... from my... friend!

16:02.503 --> 16:06.215
I spoke to Max
and he is not seeing anyone else.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.885
Oh, good. So, he’s not sleeping with
or dating anyone else?

16:10.469 --> 16:11.804
Why'd you separate those things?

16:11.887 --> 16:14.014
-What things?
-Sleeping together and dating.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.224
‘Cause they’re different.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.142
No, they’re not. Are they?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.853
[groaning] Oh, my God.

16:23.065 --> 16:27.695
Dating someone is getting to know them,
wearing pants.

16:27.778 --> 16:32.658
Sleeping with someone is not getting
to know them, not wearing pants--

16:32.741 --> 16:33.659
I get it!

16:33.742 --> 16:36.286
So, what? Now I need to have
another conversation with Max

16:36.370 --> 16:37.788
to see if he’s dating other women?

16:38.497 --> 16:41.041
Or you could just stalk him on Instagram.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.919
That's so weird you follow him,
'cause you don’t even follow me.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.047
So I can read your
boring inspirational quotes?

16:47.131 --> 16:50.718
"You can spell impossible
without 'I'm possible.'"

16:53.721 --> 16:56.765
My cousin, Christina, texted me
and told me she needed that!

16:58.892 --> 17:02.479
Okay, so I don’t see any pictures
of women on here.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.815
-That’s a good sign, right?
-Not necessarily.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.984
We need to check out what he’s tagged in.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.987
-Oh...
-What? What? What is it?

17:10.070 --> 17:11.697
I don’t think I should tell you.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.700
Women in your family
don’t handle these things well.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.037
The manager of the opera said your mother
was the biggest diva he’s ever seen.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.039
And think about where he works!

17:20.622 --> 17:22.207
Just give me that damn phone.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.461
Oh...

17:26.086 --> 17:30.132
He’s tagged in so many photos with...

17:30.215 --> 17:32.843
Really? Leggymeggy35?

17:34.970 --> 17:37.931
Here they are at a barbecue,
at a Dodgers game.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.061
At the beach,
where she's falling out of her bikini top!

17:42.853 --> 17:44.229
Wow...

17:45.856 --> 17:49.026
I don’t think Meggy’s
ever seen her leggies.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.829
Are those all things
you got from Dr. Berkowitz?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.539
Who? And yes!

18:04.249 --> 18:05.709
[laughs]

18:05.793 --> 18:08.712
Remember when he bought you
this jar opener at the Dollar Store?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.048
That's what that is?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.385
I thought it was a ThighMaster.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.181
[sighs]  Ay, Mami...

18:21.517 --> 18:24.937
I know you say you're just friends,
but admit it.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.856
You have feelings for him, don’t you?

18:28.482 --> 18:32.027
Bueno,  I will admit
that I am sad to lose him.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.612
The cheater!

18:34.404 --> 18:36.657
-Who is just my friend.
-[clicks tongue]

18:37.449 --> 18:39.618
But you can’t really be mad
at Dr. Berkowitz.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.621
Don’t you think it’s unfair
to expect a commitment

18:42.704 --> 18:44.331
when you’re not interested in dating him?

18:44.414 --> 18:46.667
-I don’t want to.
-Then he’s allowed to date other people.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
-But I don’t want him to.
-But you can’t control that.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.505
-But I don’t like it.
-But it's not fair to him.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.841
-Oh...
-What’s wrong?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.385
I just realized I’m you.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.390
One can dream.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.149
Okay, so, I know you’re not sleeping
with anyone else.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.525
But are you dating someone else?

19:11.608 --> 19:14.528
I don't know if you know this,
but those are two separate things.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.113
I knew it!

19:18.282 --> 19:19.658
What’s going on?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.035
I checked Instagram...

19:23.078 --> 19:26.665
and I saw that you were tagged
in a bunch of photos by Leggymeggy35.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.083
So, who is that?

19:30.752 --> 19:31.587
[sighs]

19:32.045 --> 19:33.881
Look, Penelope...

19:34.965 --> 19:38.969
I love spending 45 whole minutes
with you a week.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.722
But I want more.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.684
Right.

19:45.767 --> 19:51.064
So, I mean, do I like you?
Yeah, I do. A lot.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.610
Why do you think I have
a bottle of rosé in my fridge?

19:54.818 --> 19:57.779
Or DVR  Scandal?  Or have a throw?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.951
I’m not a rosé-drinking,
Scandal -watching guy with a cold lap.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.745
[chuckles softly]

20:05.454 --> 20:08.916
But on the off-chance you want to spend
some actual time together...

20:09.833 --> 20:11.376
I have all those things ready.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.134
What was that?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.014
You taped  Scandal  for me. [chuckles]

20:26.308 --> 20:27.476
I’m four behind.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.020
Glad you’re happy.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.148
Still gonna need to hear you say it.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.320
Can’t you look into my eyes
and see what I’m trying to say?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.864
Guys can’t do that. You gotta say it.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.449
[sighs]

20:44.034 --> 20:45.369
Fine.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.456
I want to be your girlfriend.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.252
And that would make me your...

20:54.002 --> 20:55.087
Boyfriend.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.672
Oh, my God.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.798
[both chuckle]

20:58.757 --> 20:59.800
[sighs]

21:04.263 --> 21:05.389
So...

21:06.098 --> 21:09.059
When do you think you might tell
Leggymeggy35 to beat it?

21:09.142 --> 21:12.229
Later tonight?
Or right now is as good a time as any.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.650
Ooh, I could,
but my family's gonna be really upset.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.776
Why?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.361
She’s my cousin.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.571
What?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.449
Why didn’t you just tell me that?

21:25.158 --> 21:26.493
And miss all this?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.791
-You’re good.
-Mmm.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.544
When do you think you'll tell your family
we're dating

21:35.627 --> 21:37.004
and I'm not Schneider's friend?

21:37.462 --> 21:39.923
'Cause that's an embarrassing thing
to have people think.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.015
Okay, everybody, I have an announcement.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.149
All right, everybody, I'm seeing somebody.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.818
-[Lydia] Oh...
-[Elena] Ooh!

21:59.901 --> 22:02.863
Who is he? Or she? Or they?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.074
[sighs] She’s been like this all day.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.579
It is a man.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.834
Oh...

22:16.501 --> 22:19.546
-It is a stallion!
-[scoffs]

22:22.924 --> 22:24.926
Everybody say hi again.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.261
-Hi, Max.
-Hi. [chuckles]

22:26.928 --> 22:27.763
Tell me, Max.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.601
Did you want a wedding in a church
or a wedding on the beach?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.019
There is a right answer.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.772
Okay, everybody say bye to Max!

22:36.855 --> 22:38.857
-Bye.
-[Elena] Bye, Max!

22:39.441 --> 22:41.818
-We’ll have you over for dinner real soon!
-Okay.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.322
-Oh, hey, Doc.
-Hey.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.326
Hi, everyone.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.288
We all have stuff to do, right?

22:53.997 --> 22:57.125
Yeah, I’m actually
meeting a friend for pizza.

22:58.502 --> 23:02.297
Oh. Meeting a friend for pizza?

23:02.380 --> 23:04.925
I think I might be hungry for pizza, too.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.301
Okay.

23:08.970 --> 23:09.805
[door closes]

23:12.265 --> 23:14.768
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.311
No need.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.483
This is my curse.
Everybody falls in love with me.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.904
They can't have me

23:25.987 --> 23:28.907
and it drives them to do crazy things
like date women

23:28.990 --> 23:31.660
who look like me
after being hit by a typhoon.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.506
I’m sorry if I hurt you, Lydia.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.467
The only reason
I went out with Esme is that

23:47.551 --> 23:52.764
you made it very clear that you wanted to
just be friends.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.810
And I want more than that.

23:57.978 --> 23:58.895
I know, Leslie.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.315
And I understand.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.443
But to tell the truth...

24:06.403 --> 24:09.781
I could never really
give my heart to you because...

24:10.824 --> 24:13.410
it already belongs to someone else.

24:15.162 --> 24:15.996
Berto.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.208
[shakily] He is the love of my life.

24:22.002 --> 24:27.007
And I cannot see myself being romantic
with anyone else.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.510
It is how you say...

24:31.595 --> 24:33.305
I am exclusive.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.184
[sniffles]

24:37.267 --> 24:38.852
I understand.

24:40.437 --> 24:44.733
And, you know, things really
don’t have to change between us.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.359
We could still be friends.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.153
No.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.741
Esme is not going to be comfortable
with you coming here

24:52.824 --> 24:55.202
to grab something that I cannot reach...

24:56.411 --> 24:59.498
or dry the dishes or water the plants.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.044
We had some wild times, didn’t we?

25:05.003 --> 25:07.881
Yes. And the opera. [inhales deeply]

25:07.964 --> 25:10.258
[speaking Spanish]

25:11.176 --> 25:14.471
[in English] But she will never allow you
to take a more beautiful

25:14.554 --> 25:17.516
and elegant woman who is smarter as well.

25:20.977 --> 25:21.811
So I...

25:23.188 --> 25:24.522
I guess it’s over?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.161
Oh! Wait. Wait.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.248
I have something to give you.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.172
It is Scarlet Sunrise.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.132
For your new friend.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.596
Thank you, Lydia. I'm sure Esme...

25:57.264 --> 25:58.765
This will make her very happy.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.183
I'm so glad. [chuckles softly]

26:01.726 --> 26:06.189
Hey, you know, maybe one day
the two of you could be friends.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.817
I would rather eat my own hand.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.452
I don’t get it, Syd.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.706
I mean, he took his
lactose-intolerant girlfriend for pizza?

26:22.789 --> 26:26.293
[chuckles]
Clearly we have more work to do.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.877
All right. Keep you posted.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.516
Papi?

26:54.738 --> 26:55.989
[door closes]
