00:15.140 --> 00:16.306
- Jon.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.226
Jon.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.520
Wake up.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.771
Santa's here.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.982
Come on, let's go see him.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.006
- It's him.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.019
- Jon.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.854
Jon.

02:52.005 --> 02:52.839
- Shit.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.848
- I'm on foot pursuit, northbound.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.671
- Fall City, River Street.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.821
- Jon?

06:46.948 --> 06:47.782
- Hi, Mom.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.124
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.794
- How was your drive?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.212
- Oh, it was fine.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.257
Is Alex here?

07:05.716 --> 07:08.761
- His deployment has been extended.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.140
He won't be home for another six months.

07:20.022 --> 07:20.857
- Jon.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.610
- Dad.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.862
- So, where's your car?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.281
- It's in the shop right now.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.911
- I spoke with Eugene
down at the post office,

07:33.911 --> 07:35.454
and you start tomorrow morning.

07:35.454 --> 07:39.250
- Dad, look, I didn't come here to work.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.002
- Oh, you have rent?

07:41.002 --> 07:42.712
- I'm actually in-between
places right now.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.464
- Oh, I see.

07:45.464 --> 07:49.719
So, your uh, your car is
in the shop, you don't have

07:49.719 --> 07:53.097
any place to live, and for
the first time in over a year,

07:53.097 --> 07:55.558
you tell us you're comin'
home just for a holiday visit?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.601
- Yes, Dad!

07:58.436 --> 08:00.396
- You are welcome to be for Christmas,

08:01.314 --> 08:04.233
but if you wanna stay any
longer, you'll need to pay rent.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.289
- Lock your keys in?

09:43.291 --> 09:44.917
- Um...

09:44.917 --> 09:46.961
Uh, yes, yeah, yeah I did.

09:51.966 --> 09:52.800
- Don't worry.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.387
I come from a long line of car people.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.308
So, I'm kind of a pro.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.653
Tah-dah!

10:14.363 --> 10:15.323
You can keep that.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.743
- Thanks, um--

10:18.743 --> 10:21.245
- Olivia.
- Olivia, Jon.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.955
- Happy to help, Jon.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.542
Have a good day, don't
lock the hanger in now.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.376
- Thank you!

11:09.377 --> 11:10.419
- Not open yet.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.381
- Jon?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.884
I should've known it was you.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.095
What, you still can't read?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.473
Or speak, for that matter.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.142
What's it been, 10 years?

11:26.352 --> 11:27.603
- What're you doing here?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.272
- Looks more like 30.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.776
I'm just here mindin' my business.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.821
Good luck with the big words.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.276
- Jon!

12:22.533 --> 12:24.368
Well, if it isn't Jon Price.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.870
- Hey, Gene.
- Come in, come in.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.246
Don't be shy.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.956
I can't tell you how
good it is to see you.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.459
What's it been, about three years?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.501
- Five.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.130
- It's gonna be great havin'
another Price at the old USPS.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.382
Followin' in your dad's footsteps?

12:38.382 --> 12:40.843
- Look, I don't know what my
dad said, but I'm actually

12:40.843 --> 12:42.761
going back to Spokane
in just a couple weeks,

12:42.761 --> 12:45.055
right after Christmas.
- Oh.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.515
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.603
Well, I suppose we can
use you as seasonal help,

12:50.644 --> 12:52.271
if that's what you need right now.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.356
- Yeah, that'd be good.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.232
- Good mornin', Eugene.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.151
I was goin' over the P
routes from last week.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.694
I noticed a couple of things--
- Derek.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.279
I want you to meet our new hire.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.740
- Jon.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.492
- You know each other?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.035
- High school.

13:06.035 --> 13:06.869
- Well, that's great.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.038
Derek, will you get Jon started?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.624
And when you're done, come by my office.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.542
I want to hear what you've been up to.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.840
- Alright, come on.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.845
I need you to start,

13:24.845 --> 13:27.056
by cleaning and organizing
the storage room.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.893
Look, it's not like there
was an opening here, alright?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.020
Eugene gave you a job out of pity,

13:33.020 --> 13:34.855
and we need to find
something for you to do.

13:34.855 --> 13:39.109
And right now, that means
cleaning the storage room.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.305
- Sorry, we're closed!

14:49.305 --> 14:50.681
- Oh, no, I was just, hey.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.613
- You son of a bitch!

15:05.613 --> 15:09.283
What you doin' in my truck?

15:15.789 --> 15:17.082
Merry Christmas, Jon.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.636
- Oh, my god!

15:32.765 --> 15:34.099
Are you alright?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.144
Let me help you.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.899
Let me help you, okay, okay.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.733
Hold on.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.661
You stay here and I'll call the police.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.745
- No, hey.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.498
Look, I'll take care of that.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.958
Really, I should just go, it's fine.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.044
- Hold on.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.529
What happened?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.074
- Just the...

16:33.450 --> 16:35.619
End to a really bad...

16:36.829 --> 16:37.663
Year.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.961
- I think with stolen cars,

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
the rate of return is pretty high.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.718
Usually it's just some moron
who wants to take the stereo.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.888
- Yeah.
- And besides.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.140
The year isn't over yet.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.392
- Huh?

16:58.392 --> 17:02.730
- Well, you said you've had a
bad year, it's not over yet.

17:03.897 --> 17:04.732
- Great.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.942
- Okay, that sounded bad.

17:06.942 --> 17:11.655
What I meant was, there's still
time for things to change.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.573
I've been there.

17:14.116 --> 17:18.287
Okay, I didn't get beat up
while my car was being stolen,

17:18.287 --> 17:19.788
but, I mean...

17:21.582 --> 17:22.583
Here it is.

17:23.666 --> 17:27.171
It's Christmas, and I've
got a daughter at home,

17:27.212 --> 17:31.008
and I'm right in the middle of a divorce.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
- I'm sorry.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.597
- It's okay.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.185
At least I have a car.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.605
Oh, my gosh, that wasn't funny.

17:44.605 --> 17:48.150
I'm so sorry, I was just--
- No, it's okay.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.610
It was funny.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.444
It was.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.659
- We're doing okay.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.661
My daughter and I.

18:00.537 --> 18:05.542
We're just holding onto
hope as best we can.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.589
I mean, she's four, how was
she supposed to understand

18:10.589 --> 18:12.216
her daddy not being around?

18:13.300 --> 18:17.304
And to make things worse, I
can hardly be there for her.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.181
She's with a sitter right now.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.143
Oh.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.480
I have to go.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.357
Okay.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.443
I'm sorry to run out like this.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.656
I'm sure my sitter's fallen asleep by now.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.366
- Oh, no, it's okay.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.333
I thought you said your
family are car people?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.794
- No.
- Sorry, that wasn't funny.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.671
- No, I mean, it was.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.048
It's just, it's my battery.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.509
Can you push?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.646
They all own cars!

19:07.646 --> 19:08.856
- What?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.441
- My family, they all own cars!

19:11.483 --> 19:15.737
That makes them car
people, right?

19:18.657 --> 19:21.952
Woo, thank god!

19:23.579 --> 19:24.496
- Or, thank Jon.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.542
- I'd offer you a ride but--
- No, no, it's okay.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.376
I don't live far.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.714
- Why don't you come by tomorrow at five?

19:33.714 --> 19:36.300
I can give you a thank-you
haircut, on the house.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.720
- I will, five o'clock?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.554
- Yeah.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
- Alright.
- Okay.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.684
Good luck with your truck and
the police and don't forget,

19:46.810 --> 19:49.605
the year isn't over yet.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.370
- I'm goin' home.
- Not yet.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.538
The lobby needs to be done, tonight.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.915
- It really doesn't.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.458
Unlike you, I have a life.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.794
- It's the holidays at the post office.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.087
You don't get a life here.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.382
And you need to be in uniform.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.713
- Hello.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.923
Hello.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.009
- Alex.
- Alex?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.260
Hey!

21:43.260 --> 21:44.553
How's it goin'?

21:44.553 --> 21:47.347
- You know, about
as good as the desert gets.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.017
- Where are you now?
- Afghanistan.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.768
I mentioned that in my last letter.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.438
- Oh, yeah.
- So, where are you now?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.273
Are you still in Spokane?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.191
Are you back in school?
- Spokane?

21:58.191 --> 22:01.111
No, I'm here, in Fall City.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.406
Working at the post office.

22:04.406 --> 22:08.201
- Oh, dude, I'm
sorry, how's that going?

22:08.201 --> 22:10.370
- Well, to be totally honest,

22:10.370 --> 22:12.748
things have been pretty shitty lately.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.001
I just, uh, I don't know.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.173
- Oh, that sucks, what's going on?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.133
- Well--

22:23.175 --> 22:26.511
Oh, man, I'm out of minutes.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.973
- Already? Dude, I haven't--

22:29.973 --> 22:33.435
- Sorry, man, can't call.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.770
Be there for Christmas.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.563
- You'll be here for Christmas?

22:36.563 --> 22:38.065
- Won't!

22:38.065 --> 22:40.692
But I hope Santa knows--

22:40.692 --> 22:42.861
In Afghanistan.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.739
- Well, didn't Dad tell you?
Santa was killed in action.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.200
Hello?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.327
Hello.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.245
Alex.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.289
Alex!

22:55.624 --> 22:57.584
Piece of shit!

22:57.584 --> 22:58.585
- Santa died?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.010
- Died?

23:07.010 --> 23:08.428
It's actually worse than that.

23:08.428 --> 23:11.389
Santa Claus isn't real.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.892
He never was, it's just your parents.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.811
You're better off knowing that now, kid.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.896
- My mom said he was real.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.106
- Well, she lied!

23:19.106 --> 23:21.399
Everybody lies, including your mom!

23:21.399 --> 23:25.237
- Excuse me?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.738
- Olivia, I, uh--

23:26.780 --> 23:28.198
- I don't believe this.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.909
I don't believe this, get in the car.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.203
What makes you think
it's any of your business

23:33.203 --> 23:34.955
to tell my daughter anything?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.415
No, I have tried so hard,

23:37.415 --> 23:40.669
so hard to make a nice Christmas
for her and you come along

23:40.669 --> 23:43.088
and you take away her
childhood in two seconds!

23:44.131 --> 23:45.215
You know what?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.758
I'm glad that guy beat you up.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.260
I just wish I could've helped!

23:58.228 --> 24:01.731
No, no, you've done enough!

25:10.133 --> 25:11.843
What do you want?

25:11.843 --> 25:12.928
- I, uh...

25:14.387 --> 25:15.430
Still need a haircut.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.228
- Fine.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.062
Sit.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.452
So, what are we gonna do?

25:39.079 --> 25:40.580
- I was hoping I could
talk to your daughter--

25:40.580 --> 25:42.666
- No, about your hair.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.168
What are we gonna do about your hair?

25:45.168 --> 25:48.630
- Well, I like how it is, so
a little shorter, I guess?

26:20.662 --> 26:21.538
So...

26:23.415 --> 26:24.833
What's your daughter's name?

26:29.087 --> 26:29.921
- Adiel.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.215
- Adiel?

26:32.257 --> 26:33.091
That's unique.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.304
- She doesn't think
Santa is coming anymore.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.723
- Yeah, about that.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.100
- It was the worst possible
thing you could've told her.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.853
I've been working really hard
to give her a nice Christmas

26:44.853 --> 26:46.896
so that she can have something to trust,

26:46.896 --> 26:48.356
and then you come along.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.153
- Yeah, it wasn't a good day.
- Yeah, you made sure of that.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.328
- There used to be a
barber shop near here.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.750
I was probably just a
little older than Adiel.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.172
And it was there that my dad decided

27:12.172 --> 27:16.760
to tell me the truth about Santa Claus,

27:17.719 --> 27:20.180
right before my grandpa's funeral.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.309
My grandpa,

27:24.309 --> 27:27.479
he used to dress up like
Santa Claus every year,

27:27.479 --> 27:29.564
and he'd always be there
when my brother and I

27:29.564 --> 27:33.068
would sneak out of our
room and we'd see him

27:33.068 --> 27:35.028
putting toys under the Christmas tree.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.698
I wish more kids could
be so lucky to see that.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.035
It just made it that much more real.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.418
And, all at once,

27:52.420 --> 27:53.671
Santa was gone,

27:55.507 --> 27:57.926
and so was the man who
made him real for us.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.182
Look, I know none of this
explains what I did, but I just...

28:04.182 --> 28:05.016
- Jon?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.620
I just, uh...

28:27.122 --> 28:29.290
Wanted to say I was sorry.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.489
- Hey, son.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.116
How was your day?

29:46.784 --> 29:47.619
- It's fine, Mom.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.164
- Do you wanna talk about it?

29:52.624 --> 29:55.376
You know, sometimes it really helps to--

29:55.376 --> 29:56.711
- Really.

29:56.711 --> 29:57.545
I'm fine.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.089
- Okay.

31:15.790 --> 31:16.624
- Come in.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.676
John, what can I do for you?

31:26.676 --> 31:27.677
- Hey, Eugene.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.513
Do you know where this came from?

31:36.394 --> 31:37.812
- Looks like the North Pole.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.569
It must've been a treat, you
kids getting these each year.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.821
We didn't get much feedback from it.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.573
- It came from here?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.116
- Sure!

31:50.116 --> 31:52.744
This was probably written by your grandpa.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.578
- What?

31:54.954 --> 31:58.875
- Every year, Central
allows local volunteers to

31:58.875 --> 32:01.586
take care of the letters to
Santa from their zip code.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.256
Your grandpa used to come
to work with your dad

32:05.256 --> 32:06.257
and write back.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.386
- So, who does it now?

32:11.679 --> 32:12.555
- Let me show you.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.314
I used to try to get to some when I could.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.692
A few employees did, too, but
it's been hard to find people

32:24.692 --> 32:25.860
or time in recent years.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.337
- Oh, is he still living out there?

32:44.337 --> 32:46.923
- Yeah, he is, he's
still got his farm going.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.220
- Oh, hello there.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.973
Shouldn't you be with your mom?

32:55.973 --> 32:57.975
- Vegetables are boring.

32:57.975 --> 32:59.894
- Yes, they are.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.854
- I wanna find the candy canes.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.317
- Do you remember me?

33:06.317 --> 33:07.860
- Yeah, you're an asshole.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.616
- You probably shouldn't say that.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.703
- That's what my mom said, I
heard her talking on the phone.

33:17.829 --> 33:22.834
- Well, I guess that's me, or Jon.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.377
That's my name, Jon.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.212
- What're you looking for?

33:26.212 --> 33:29.382
- Well, that's a good question.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.677
Very profound.

33:32.677 --> 33:37.098
- What does that mean?
- It's a word that, hey, look.

33:37.140 --> 33:41.269
I'm sorry for being an,
for being so mean to you.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.273
All those things that I said,
I didn't mean them okay?

33:45.273 --> 33:47.900
- Why did you say it
if you didn't mean it?

33:47.900 --> 33:52.905
- Well, 'cause Santa isn't for adults.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.907
Santa just brings toys to kids.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.868
- Why isn't Santa for adults?

33:57.744 --> 33:59.579
- Well, that's another good question.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.583
Well, I guess you could say--
- Jon?

34:05.668 --> 34:08.045
- She come up to me, I swear.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.255
- You shouldn't swear.

34:10.255 --> 34:11.674
- It's okay.

34:11.674 --> 34:12.675
I'm glad it's you.

34:13.717 --> 34:17.096
When I see Adiel talking to
strangers, it freaks me out.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.514
- She's really smart.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.310
- Mommy, can we
get some marshmallows?

34:22.310 --> 34:25.855
- Listen, I wanted to thank
you for the car battery.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.774
You really didn't have to do that.

34:27.774 --> 34:32.110
Also, I'm sorry about your
hair, I can fix it anytime.

34:32.152 --> 34:34.112
- Marshmallows, marshmallows.

34:34.112 --> 34:35.656
- No, not today, sweetheart.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.202
Anyway, we have to be going.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.411
- Right, of course.
- Jon has marshmallows.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.080
Can he make cookies with us?

34:45.123 --> 34:48.418
- Well, I do have marshmallows.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.510
- Oh, your stars look beautiful.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.220
- Pretty.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.181
We have to have two for everyone.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.183
Look at that, I did amazing!

35:02.225 --> 35:04.060
Now can I do it in the middle?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.728
- Now you can do it in
the middle, here you go.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.980
Do you wanna trade with me?

35:07.980 --> 35:11.150
I think it's ready, I
think you can decorate it.

35:11.150 --> 35:15.404
And then just itsy-bitsy, oh,
that's too much, sweetheart.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.698
- It's for keeping out the bad guys.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.534
- Like this guy?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.035
Charge!

35:22.245 --> 35:25.164
Charge, he's gonna get, oh, no!

35:27.750 --> 35:28.960
No!

35:31.420 --> 35:34.215
- Now I'm gonna attack you!

35:34.215 --> 35:37.051
Oh, Adiel!

35:37.051 --> 35:38.719
- I'm so sorry.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.597
- It's past your bedtime.

35:44.851 --> 35:45.685
It's okay.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.634
Oh, you don't need to do that.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.553
- Sorry.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.096
- No, I didn't mean...

36:23.222 --> 36:24.515
Thank you.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.310
Sorry to make you wait.
- Oh, that's okay.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.185
- Have a seat.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.021
- What?

36:42.700 --> 36:45.119
College didn't agree with me,

36:46.078 --> 36:50.082
and I definitely didn't agree with it.

36:50.082 --> 36:53.711
But I was expected to go,
supposed to find my path.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.965
But that path just led
to academic probation,

36:59.383 --> 37:02.887
so when a new semester came
around, I just didn't re-enroll.

37:06.682 --> 37:10.186
- When I found out that
I was having Adiel,

37:10.186 --> 37:12.230
I was completely in shock.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.776
I thought I would have
time for so many things.

37:18.569 --> 37:23.240
But now, I can't imagine
my life without her.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.285
I never would have imagined

37:27.286 --> 37:29.246
that the hardest moment in my life

37:30.373 --> 37:33.125
would've led to some of the best.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.593
There.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.439
- Thanks for letting me come over.

37:55.439 --> 37:58.651
- It was nice to see Adiel smiling again.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.071
- Maybe I can come by again?

38:04.323 --> 38:05.157
- Listen.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.954
I'm not really looking for
a relationship right now.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.124
I'm sorry if that's blunt,

38:13.124 --> 38:16.252
but I just wanna be upfront with you.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.464
Life's been so unstable lately,

38:21.590 --> 38:23.926
and I'm still just trying
to figure it all out.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.013
It was nice having an actual grownup

38:27.013 --> 38:28.389
to talk to tonight, though.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.102
I just don't wanna give
you the wrong idea.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.020
- No, that's fine.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.983
If a friend is what you need right now,

38:40.234 --> 38:41.485
then that's what I'll be.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.447
- I could definitely use a friend.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.658
- So, I'll see you again?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.578
Okay.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.454
Goodnight.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.667
Hey.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.962
Tell Adiel to write a
letter to Santa Claus.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.005
- What?

39:01.047 --> 39:03.049
- Just address it to the North Pole.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.759
I'll make sure she gets a response.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.219
- Okay, I will.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.054
- Alright.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.264
- Goodnight.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.451
- "Dear Santa, thank you for
the Star Wars stuff last year.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.037
"Does Rudolph have a red nose?

39:33.037 --> 39:38.000
"This year, I want a
helicopter and some candy.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.627
"Your best pal, Joshua."

39:43.547 --> 39:44.548
Dear Joshua.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.678
Helicopters are awesome.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.769
I've been thinking maybe I could
do more than just cleaning.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.270
- There's not a lot of
sense in training you

39:58.270 --> 39:59.855
if you're leaving in a few weeks.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.732
- Actually, I was thinking

40:01.732 --> 40:04.151
I would stick around a while longer.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.736
- Now, that's what I wanna hear.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.905
- "Santa, I have been very good.

40:07.905 --> 40:11.283
"Can Big Bird visit me
with Cookie Monster too?"

40:11.325 --> 40:14.245
"Dear Santa, this year
if you bring presents

40:14.245 --> 40:18.207
"that need batteries, please
bring batteries, Gabby."

40:18.207 --> 40:20.042
- Derek, I'd like you to show Jon

40:20.042 --> 40:20.876
the auto-sort system today.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.671
Then I need you to get
him a key to the building.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.631
- Dear Daniel.

40:25.631 --> 40:26.715
Dear Megan.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.093
Dear Gabby, I'll bring batteries.

40:29.093 --> 40:33.013
- This is auto-sort, each stack
has an ad code next to it.

40:33.013 --> 40:35.724
Punch that into the machine,
you run each one through.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.733
- Jon, hey!

40:44.733 --> 40:45.568
- Hey.

40:45.568 --> 40:50.573
I was wondering if I, if you
could, wanted to eat lunch.

40:52.032 --> 40:52.908
- Sure!

40:52.950 --> 40:56.871
Just give me a second, okay?

40:56.871 --> 41:00.374
- How's it goin', man?
- Good, how are you?

41:17.808 --> 41:20.102
- Thursday
night is spaghetti night.

41:20.102 --> 41:20.936
- Do you wanna come?

41:22.104 --> 41:23.564
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.774
- That'd be awesome.
- We even have salad.

41:25.774 --> 41:26.984
- Okay.
- Okay!

41:26.984 --> 41:28.527
- Salad.

41:28.527 --> 41:29.987
- Gonna chop up your pasta?

41:33.574 --> 41:34.491
Chop it up.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.828
We'll help you chop the pasta.

41:58.015 --> 41:58.849
Shh.

42:02.394 --> 42:03.854
I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

42:03.854 --> 42:04.688
- Okay.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.309
Out like a light.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.187
- You have a record player.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.021
- Yeah.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.148
It was my mom's.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.734
- There's nothin' quite like 'em.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.862
All the pops and scratches.

43:16.635 --> 43:17.469
- Hmm, yeah.

43:18.846 --> 43:22.975
Now, this is Christmas.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.894
- I'm not seeing Chipmunks
Christmas in here.

43:25.894 --> 43:26.729
- Chipmunks?

43:27.605 --> 43:28.772
- No chipmunks?
- Shh!

43:29.857 --> 43:31.358
- I'm sorry.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.865
- Chipmunks are fine,
but that's not Christmas.

43:40.659 --> 43:43.287
- I don't think we can be friends anymore.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.121
- Okay.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.294
I have one that I bet you'll love.

44:26.538 --> 44:28.999
♪ The snow is falling ♪

44:28.999 --> 44:29.833
- Well?

44:31.293 --> 44:34.004
- Yeah.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.839
- This is a good one.

44:42.888 --> 44:47.893
- We can still be friends.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.288
- It wasn't the best tent in the world.

45:08.288 --> 45:12.501
I mean, just a little bit of
rain, we'd wake up in puddles!

45:12.501 --> 45:16.505
But Alex insisted we do it
every night the entire summer.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.174
And we didn't even sleep
on pads or anything.

45:19.174 --> 45:22.386
I think my back is still out
of alignment from that summer.

45:25.764 --> 45:29.226
- Oh, god, I can't
imagine having my brother

45:29.226 --> 45:31.145
halfway around the world like that.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.814
I thought my sister was far away,

45:33.814 --> 45:35.732
and she's only in North Carolina.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.154
- Do you have any family in Washington?

45:41.196 --> 45:44.450
- No.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.909
I came out here for school.

45:47.202 --> 45:48.954
And then I met my husband.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.874
And he's from here, so...

45:53.959 --> 45:55.210
This is where I stayed.

46:00.215 --> 46:02.718
- Do you mind if I ask what happened?

46:05.762 --> 46:07.097
- It's a long story.

46:10.684 --> 46:14.229
He wasn't taking things seriously.

46:15.564 --> 46:19.943
I was the one working,
all through the pregnancy.

46:21.695 --> 46:25.491
I told him if he didn't step
it up, that he needed to leave.

46:27.367 --> 46:30.829
We've been doing counseling
sessions at my church, but,

46:30.829 --> 46:32.539
they haven't been going very well.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.542
The truth is, I don't
want Adiel growing up

46:35.542 --> 46:36.960
without a father around.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.465
Things have been so hard on her
lately and she still doesn't

46:41.507 --> 46:43.926
fully believe that
Santa's coming this year.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.804
I'm just trying to make ends meet,

46:49.264 --> 46:51.058
let alone be there for Adiel.

46:53.101 --> 46:54.603
And it just seems like,

46:56.605 --> 46:58.565
no matter how hard I try,

47:00.567 --> 47:04.071
everything just still falls apart.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.159
- Mommy?

47:10.702 --> 47:12.412
- Oh, sweetie, what's wrong?

47:12.412 --> 47:16.083
- I had the spider dream, can
you read me a bedtime story?

47:16.917 --> 47:18.961
- It's a little late for a bedtime story.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.673
Here, let me get you a
drink of water, okay?

47:34.810 --> 47:35.644
- Jon?

47:36.562 --> 47:38.230
Will you read me a bedtime story?

47:39.231 --> 47:40.065
- I don't know.

47:41.441 --> 47:42.568
What kinda stories do you like?

47:42.568 --> 47:45.320
- I like the frog and bird
one, it's right there.

47:46.905 --> 47:47.739
- Okay.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.206
"Once there was a frog
who lived in the swamp.

47:57.165 --> 48:00.877
"Far below the leafy trees, he would swim,

48:00.877 --> 48:02.963
"and warm himself in the sun.

48:05.757 --> 48:09.219
"One day, the bird
called down to the frog.

48:09.219 --> 48:12.848
"'From up here, I can touch the sky.'

48:12.889 --> 48:16.893
"The frog replied, 'down here,
I can explore everything,

48:16.893 --> 48:19.354
"'under the trees and in the water.'

48:20.397 --> 48:24.026
"'You've got the land
and I've got the sky.

48:25.110 --> 48:29.615
"'Together,' said the bird,
'we've got everything covered.'"

48:31.575 --> 48:33.076
- Jon?

48:33.076 --> 48:35.704
- Yeah?
- Are you spending the night?

48:38.498 --> 48:39.750
- No, sweetie.

48:40.792 --> 48:41.627
He can't.

48:44.546 --> 48:45.797
- I'm gonna go.

48:48.216 --> 48:52.929
♪ Silent night ♪

48:52.929 --> 48:56.933
♪ Holy night ♪

48:56.933 --> 49:00.520
♪ All is calm ♪

49:00.520 --> 49:04.399
♪ All is bright ♪

49:04.399 --> 49:10.656
♪ Round yon virgin, mother and child ♪

49:59.830 --> 50:03.291
- Oh, Jon, I wasn't
expecting you to be in here.

50:03.291 --> 50:04.960
I just came to bring these in.

50:06.211 --> 50:09.631
- My shift doesn't start
until eight, I was just, uh--

50:09.673 --> 50:12.718
- It's okay, I was hoping
you'd do some of this.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.428
That's quite a stack.

50:14.428 --> 50:15.846
- I'm actually hoping
that we can get these

50:15.846 --> 50:18.974
on the outgoing trucks
the morning of the 23rd.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.143
That way, the kids could
have them by Christmas Eve.

50:21.184 --> 50:23.854
- That will certainly make their day.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.646
- Gene.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.150
A few weeks ago, you mentioned that

50:28.150 --> 50:29.985
there was an assistant position available.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.194
- Yes?

50:31.194 --> 50:33.405
You know Derek's interested
in that position, too?

50:33.405 --> 50:34.239
- Sure.

50:35.240 --> 50:40.245
- But you know, more than
experience, more than knowledge,

50:40.245 --> 50:43.165
what I look for in that
position is strong character.

50:44.166 --> 50:47.586
You keep up the good
work, we'll keep talkin'.

50:47.586 --> 50:48.420
- Thanks.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.073
"Dear Santa.

51:17.073 --> 51:20.535
"Thank you for the presents
last year, I loved them a lot.

51:20.535 --> 51:23.997
"This year, the only thing I want is a

51:23.997 --> 51:27.334
"original Care Bear called Wish Bear.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.169
"Adiel."

51:32.380 --> 51:33.215
A Care Bear?

51:43.850 --> 51:44.851
Oh, come on.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.866
Hey, Mom, do you mind if borrow your car?

51:59.866 --> 52:01.952
I've got a couple of
errands I need to run.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.496
- Sure, I just need it back by tonight.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.330
- Thanks.

53:40.383 --> 53:41.968
- Olivia, slow down and just give--

53:41.968 --> 53:44.429
- No, I don't wanna stay here
and listen to him talk at me--

53:44.429 --> 53:47.140
- Olivia, I tried to tell--
- Derek.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.516
- You're always telling me something,

53:48.558 --> 53:50.977
and I'm tired of hearing it.
- What do you want from me?

53:50.977 --> 53:52.062
- I want you to listen,

53:52.062 --> 53:54.606
and stop talking over me all the time!

53:54.606 --> 53:55.690
I don't wanna be here!

54:01.279 --> 54:05.200
- Just give her a chance--
- Okay, Adam, please.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.463
- No no no, I'm just
getting more groceries, okay?

54:18.463 --> 54:19.547
I'm coming right back.

54:24.552 --> 54:25.387
- Hey.

54:26.262 --> 54:27.389
- Jon?

54:27.389 --> 54:29.391
- Could I help?
- No, I've got it.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.477
- I come bearing gifts.

54:33.561 --> 54:36.106
- Jon, I'm not really up for
anything right now, okay?

54:36.106 --> 54:38.483
I just need some time alone.

54:38.483 --> 54:40.485
- Okay, yeah, maybe I can take Adiel to--

54:40.485 --> 54:42.028
- No, Jon!

54:42.070 --> 54:44.322
I mean we need time alone.

54:44.322 --> 54:47.742
I just, I can't do this.

54:47.742 --> 54:49.577
Not right now, things are too hard.

54:51.287 --> 54:52.122
- I understand what you're going through.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.874
- Dammit, Jon, will you
please listen to me?

54:54.874 --> 54:58.169
You don't understand,
I don't wanna do this!

55:51.806 --> 55:54.893
- It was a family
emergency in Oregon, I think.

55:54.893 --> 55:55.935
- But Derek?

55:57.062 --> 56:00.273
I guess the young were
bound to inherit the Earth.

56:00.273 --> 56:01.733
- Wait, what?

56:01.733 --> 56:02.942
What's Derek inheriting?

56:03.818 --> 56:06.112
- Assistant Post Master for now.

56:06.112 --> 56:07.989
- Eugene promoted him this morning.

56:07.989 --> 56:08.823
- What?

56:21.795 --> 56:22.629
- Jon?

56:23.838 --> 56:25.215
I need to speak with you.

56:25.215 --> 56:26.758
- Why is this door locked?

56:26.758 --> 56:28.301
- Privately, if you don't mind.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.648
Oh, nice, you think you own
the place already, don't you?

56:41.648 --> 56:44.484
- Jon, have you ever been
convicted of a felony

56:44.526 --> 56:47.237
or served time in prison?
- What does that have to...

56:50.281 --> 56:52.158
That's none of your damn business.

56:52.158 --> 56:53.368
- We have to let you go.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.705
- You don't have the authority to do that.

56:57.705 --> 56:59.165
- I do, actually.

56:59.165 --> 57:01.000
- Oh, of course.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.336
Mr. Assistant Post Master!

57:03.336 --> 57:05.797
Congratulations, by the way,
on the promotion, I didn't

57:05.839 --> 57:08.299
think you and your purple
car would last another week!

57:08.299 --> 57:10.301
- Federal employees can't
have been to prison.

57:10.301 --> 57:11.719
- Where's Eugene?

57:11.761 --> 57:13.680
- You need to get your things and leave.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.056
- Where's Eugene?

57:16.015 --> 57:19.144
- He had a family emergency,
he's in Oregon for two weeks.

57:19.144 --> 57:21.938
He already knows, it was called
into Central this morning.

57:21.938 --> 57:22.772
It's done.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.281
Jon, you're not allowed back here anymore.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.700
- Yeah what do you think I'm
gonna do, steal someone's mail?

57:34.576 --> 57:36.619
- Jon, you're fired!

57:36.619 --> 57:38.872
Now, get out of here
before I call the police.

58:38.139 --> 58:40.683
- Oh, you're home, I thought
you had to work today?

58:41.768 --> 58:43.519
- No.
- Well, good.

58:43.519 --> 58:45.104
I could use your help.

58:45.104 --> 58:47.273
I wanted to make some cookies
for friends at work tomorrow.

58:47.273 --> 58:49.067
You're welcome to take some
to work, too, when we're done.

58:49.067 --> 58:51.402
- I'm really not in the mood right now.

58:51.402 --> 58:52.237
- Look, Jon.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.617
I know you've been through
a lot recently, but,

58:57.617 --> 59:01.371
it's Christmas, New Year,
it's time for new beginnings.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.665
- New rent?
- Everybody pays rent, Jon.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.500
- Not to their parents.

59:05.500 --> 59:06.918
You're supposed to be helping me.

59:06.918 --> 59:10.296
- We're trying to help you,
trying to help you learn.

59:10.296 --> 59:13.091
- I know how to learn,
I know how to pay rent.

59:13.132 --> 59:14.384
That's not what I need right now.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.010
- Then what? What, Jon, what do you need?

59:16.010 --> 59:17.595
- I don't know, I just,
I need, maybe some--

59:17.595 --> 59:19.514
- What, a break?
- Yes!

59:19.514 --> 59:21.849
- You've been on a break for years!

59:21.891 --> 59:24.352
- Yeah, I'm sorry, let me
just get right back to school.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.437
- You're not in school because you quit!

59:26.437 --> 59:28.147
- Oh, Mom.
- It's true!

59:28.147 --> 59:30.858
You talk about life like it's
taken everything from you,

59:30.858 --> 59:34.028
but you're the one who keeps
throwing everything away!

59:34.028 --> 59:36.531
Blame it on academic probation,
blame it on whatever,

59:36.531 --> 59:39.867
but you chose to stop going to classes.

59:39.867 --> 59:41.327
You were fired from your job,

59:41.327 --> 59:45.039
because you chose to
break into somebody's car!

59:45.081 --> 59:49.460
You lost your apartment
because you lost your job.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.005
These are your choices,
Jon, no one else's!

59:52.005 --> 59:53.506
- Fine, Mom, yeah, fine!

59:54.382 --> 59:56.759
I've made mistakes, I know!

59:56.759 --> 59:58.428
But not everything is like that!

59:58.469 --> 01:00:00.888
Some things are just gonna
fall apart no matter what.

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.348
Like life is gonna dangle something

01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:03.641
right in front of your face and then

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:06.519
snatch it away without you
having done anything wrong.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:08.271
Have I made crap choices?

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.605
Sure!

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:11.316
But everyone has.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:15.445
But sometimes, life is just plain shit!

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:22.827
- That's true.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:25.663
- Okay?

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:27.790
- Okay.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:32.837
- Okay.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.717
I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:10.625
Come on.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:18.091
Really?
- Whisky.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.649
- You got anything you wanna
say before I kick your ass?

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.734
- Shut up, Jon.
- Unbelievable.

01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:38.361
Unbelievable!

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.072
You have me mopping floors
and then you take a promotion

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.199
you didn't deserve and fire me with it.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:46.285
Oh, you've got big balls or a death wish

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:48.329
to show your face around me right now.

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:50.623
- I didn't fire you.
- I'm sorry, what?

01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:53.000
- I said, I didn't fire you!

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.585
And you shouldn't have been
hired in the first place.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:55.920
So don't give me your pity story.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.048
- You don't know me, you
don't know anything about me.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.800
- Save it for a judge, Jon.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.803
You should be comfortable
standing in front of one by now.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.471
- Hey!

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.347
Relax.

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:12.728
- You don't know why I needed
that job, and it sure as hell

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.814
was a better reason than your shitty car.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:15.898
- Drop the car.
- What?

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.358
You're mumbling again, I can't hear you.

01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:19.152
- I sold the car, okay?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:19.986
So, drop it.

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:22.447
- What?

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.576
- Been trying to for a month.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:29.579
It's sold now, okay, it's gone.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.959
I just, I needed the money.

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:37.753
- Needed the money?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.965
For what?
- For life, Jon.

01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:42.425
And I didn't take that promotion, okay?

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.260
Eugene gave it to me.
- No, he told me that--

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.596
- Yeah, he probably would
have given it to you.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:51.017
He talked about you like you were family.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.019
But then he found out about your felony.

01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:56.230
He said a new start could
be a good thing for you.

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:58.191
Now you could really spread your wings.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:02.987
- What about you?

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:05.990
- I have a family, Jon.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.286
A wife and a little girl.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.456
I wasn't providing.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:17.376
I need that money.

01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:21.214
I need it for my family.

01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:08.886
- Yeah.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:14.308
- Hey.

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:15.142
Jon.

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:19.647
Do you have a minute?

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:20.898
- Sure.

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:24.068
- I, um, talked with Eugene the other day,

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:26.487
and he told me how you'd
been writing those letters

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:28.281
from Santa like Grandpa did.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.741
Comin' in early and everything.

01:04:33.744 --> 01:04:34.662
Got this, uh...

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.293
This box has a bunch of his
old things in it and I...

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.632
It seems like you might wanna see it.

01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:02.607
- Thanks.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.735
- You know, I realized today that,

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:09.947
I wasn't much older than
you are when Grandpa died.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.075
It was hard.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.746
I know it was for you,
but it was for me, too.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:23.669
I'm sure I felt a lot like
you do now, a little lost.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:28.674
You see, when
you were first born, uh,

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:35.973
I was pretty scared, I, I
didn't know how to be a dad.

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.560
And with Grandpa around,
I relied on him a lot.

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:43.606
So, when he was gone, it was hard.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:47.568
But you know, going through
this box, I realized that

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.529
he had his fair share of struggles, too.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.866
In spite of those troubles, he was,

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.619
he was still the same old Grandpa.

01:06:06.587 --> 01:06:08.047
He'd be proud of you, Jon.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.967
Excited that you wrote
those letters like he did.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.899
- Can I
help you find anything?

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.026
- Yeah, actually, I'm
trying to do a really nice

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:54.528
Christmas dinner for a friend
of mine and her daughter.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:56.697
- No, no.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:59.366
Let's just put that right there.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:01.994
This is a potato.

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:04.622
Until they're tender, you
stick a fork into it and it

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:07.541
can come out 15 minutes, the
same time as the cranberries.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.794
These are parsnips.

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.921
They're kind of like carrots,
a little bit different.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.755
- Okay.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.343
- So, instead,

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.763
and it'll look really flashy and cool.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.599
I have full confidence
you're gonna be alright.

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:26.935
Alright.
- Thanks so much.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.145
- You're so welcome.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.488
- Yeah, hold on.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.805
- I know it's not the same
without Alex here, but,

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.642
I just thought, just for tonight,

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:12.398
we could pretend that
he's safe and with us.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:17.611
- Thank you, dear.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:21.948
- Thanks, Mom.

01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:33.961
- Years ago, during my summers,
I worked as a deck hand

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:38.131
on a small coast skimmer
making logging runs and,

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:42.845
we'd come back into Seattle,
most of the time we were empty

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.265
but on this particular night,

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:48.309
Christmas Eve,

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.604
we carrying toys.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.818
- With the radar out, I was
certain we were off course.

01:09:57.818 --> 01:10:01.488
Now, I was worried, because
it was Christmas Eve,

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:04.575
and I knew our cargo was full of toys.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:08.078
Then, I looked up from the wheelhouse,

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:10.372
and through the thickness of the fog,

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:14.752
I saw a small but bright
red light in the sky.

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:15.586
- Santa Claus.

01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:22.635
- Well, I can't say for sure,
but that light guided us

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.386
all the way to the docks.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:31.602
And after we moored, I
walked out onto the deck,

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.648
and I distinctly heard bells disappearing

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.067
with the red light into the fog.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:32.913
- Yeah, I'm in.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.374
Looks like the back door's been opened.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.084
I'm checkin' the front now.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.050
- Suspect's exiting the back.

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:51.992
- No!

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.952
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.583
- Are you alright?

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:01.752
- Can you help?

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.380
Please!

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.385
- I gotta call the police.
- No!

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.554
I have to hurry.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.984
- You better run.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:42.431
- Mommy?

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.682
- He's goin' around back.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.521
- It's Santa Claus!

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:23.365
- Dear Derek.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.784
I'm sorry for writing a letter.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:29.162
It's sometime easier for me to
get my thoughts out this way.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.874
I can't tell you how often
I wish I could go back

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:34.918
and change everything.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.671
Change what happened and what I said.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:39.714
But I know I can't.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.677
I can only work on moving
forward and start again.

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:47.806
My pride got in the way and
I let it blind me to the fact

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.016
that you were working to do better.

01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:53.228
Adiel's been struggling lately,

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:56.648
and I've recently been
reminded how important it is

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:58.733
to have a loving father around her.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.905
I know saying sorry in
a letter isn't the same,

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:05.907
so I'd love to tell you in person.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:09.703
If you're willing, I would
love to have you back

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:11.496
for Christmas with Adiel and I.

01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:15.417
We'll be here on Christmas Eve.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.085
I hope you will be as well.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.130
I understand if you don't wanna come,

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.842
but know that a new beginning
is here waiting for you.

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:25.677
And for us.

01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:28.430
Love, Olivia.

01:20:17.437 --> 01:20:18.271
- Hey.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:25.320
Jon?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.127
Where did you get this?

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.256
- Sorry, I shouldn't have taken it.

01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:48.844
But just know that she wants you back.

01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:51.721
They both do.

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.599
- How do you even know--
- Just...

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.269
Take care of them.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:20:59.646
Okay?

01:21:52.657 --> 01:21:54.701
- Do you
think he jumped in the water?

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:57.078
- Catch
hypothermia, if he did.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:01.499
I'll bet he ran underneath
while we were comin' down.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:48.833
- Hello.
- What're you doin' sleepin'?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:51.503
It's Christmas!
- Alex?

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:54.172
Hey, I thought you weren't
gonna be able to call?

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:56.382
- They were able to
set up a satellite connection.

01:24:56.382 --> 01:24:58.676
Just for today, I hope that's alright.

01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:00.887
- No, that's great, that's great!

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:02.639
- So, how is everything?

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.975
- Oh, geez!

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:06.893
Where do I start?

01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:11.856
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:13.024
Yeah.

01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:14.984
Yeah, that Derek.

01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:16.945
Yeah, so it turns out they
didn't even have a job

01:25:16.986 --> 01:25:19.989
for me at all, so, I just
ended mopping floors all day.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:25.370
And then it was right before
I talked to you last, yeah.

01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:28.164
Uh-huh, hold on.

01:25:28.164 --> 01:25:31.251
And is if that isn't bad
enough, I have to work late,

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:36.422
so I miss her, okay, but it
does get worse than that.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.928
They actually sent a letter to
the post office that morning.

01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:42.929
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:42.929 --> 01:25:44.055
No, it's okay.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:45.807
Yeah, I was actually thinking that.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:50.520
Yeah, maybe next semester.
- Oh, that would be great!

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.481
You totally should--

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.440
Jon?
- I know.

01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:58.736
- It was nice talkin' to you.
- It was.

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:01.239
- Don't forget to write!
- I won't, I promise.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:04.617
Alex?

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:44.240
- Yes, finally!

01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:46.701
I got this!

01:26:48.119 --> 01:26:49.537
Thank you, Dad.

01:27:02.675 --> 01:27:07.597
- Are you so excited? We got
so many more presents to open!

01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:14.270
- Jon?

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:19.317
It is you.

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.159
You look terrible.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.745
Are you okay?

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:31.579
- Yeah.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:34.290
Actually, I'm good.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.336
- What is this?

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:40.880
- That's for Adiel.

01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:44.175
- Adiel?
- Yeah.

01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:46.344
That's what Adiel asked
Santa to bring her.

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:51.140
- Clever little girl.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:51.975
- What is it?

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:57.772
- Jon this is what I asked Santa
for when I was Adiel's age.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.483
She must have remembered, I
told her that I asked for it,

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:01.526
and I never got one.

01:28:03.152 --> 01:28:04.112
- So, it's for you.

01:28:06.739 --> 01:28:11.744
Look, Olivia, I just hope you
got everything you wanted.

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.121
- I did.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:16.499
- Good.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.837
- And what about you?

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:21.713
- I will.

01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:24.549
Someday.

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:25.383
I know I will.

01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:30.096
I should go.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:32.640
- Hey.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.652
