00:02.170 --> 00:03.649
Previously
on "Life Sentence"...

00:03.690 --> 00:05.738
Stella: Fate literally
brought us together.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.953
You are the only man
I have ever loved.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.048
You got a married woman
pregnant, Aiden.

00:10.090 --> 00:11.171
It's time to deal with it.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.699
_ I'm in.
Anything you need, Marlene.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.434
I helped Lizzie get into
a writer's retreat

00:14.490 --> 00:16.049
so she could finally focus.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.397
You know I'm gonna
kill you, right?

00:17.450 --> 00:19.054
Maybe I'm not ready
to date.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.750
I'm Lauren.
I'm Peter.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.016
Lauren?
Aiden?

00:24.060 --> 00:25.232
What are you doing here?!

00:25.280 --> 00:28.068
I live here
with my father.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.327
We got a lot of bills to pay.

00:29.370 --> 00:32.715
And my savings
aren't gonna last forever.

00:32.770 --> 00:36.855
I'm just a sailor
swimming backwards

00:36.900 --> 00:40.985
I'm just a fish
out in the sea

00:41.040 --> 00:43.077
I'm just a preacher
in the graveyard

00:43.130 --> 00:44.427
Morning, babe.
Morning.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.120
Telling everyone but God
to follow me

00:46.170 --> 00:48.081
There are some days
when it seems like the sun

00:48.130 --> 00:50.087
is shining just for you,

00:50.130 --> 00:51.438
like in the movies...

00:51.480 --> 00:55.610
and everything is perfectly
in sync.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.970
Today was one of those days.

01:02.010 --> 01:04.888
This is for all those dreams
I believed in

01:04.930 --> 01:07.627
I mean, I was still figuring
out how to support myself

01:07.670 --> 01:09.274
without my parents' help.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.277
You know, I've been thinking --
I want to get a better job.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.196
Hmm. Really?
What do you have in mind?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.151
No idea. I just think it's
a little demeaning to have

01:16.200 --> 01:17.850
a 20-year-old as a boss.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.289
I just want something that
makes me feel independent

01:20.340 --> 01:21.728
and like I'm taking steps
forward.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.295
Mm-hmm.And more money would be good.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.115
Ooh, that sounds like a plan.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.207
Not yet, but it will be.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.160
I just needed a sign.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.648
I'll be just fine

01:32.700 --> 01:34.475
Huh.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.137
And I wasn't the only one
trying to figure out my life.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.045
Aiden was getting his first
taste of what it felt like

01:42.100 --> 01:44.614
to be the third wheel.

01:44.660 --> 01:47.140
Sorry. Just trying
to go anywhere else,

01:47.190 --> 01:48.919
"cause this is awkward.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.758
Lauren,
this is my son, Aiden.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.848
It is nice to meet you,
Aiden.

01:53.890 --> 01:56.018
Your dad speaks
very highly of you.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.754
Aiden, sit.
I'll get you some coffee.

01:57.810 --> 02:01.246
This is for all those dreams
I believed in

02:01.290 --> 02:03.804
This is
a wild, wild world...

02:03.860 --> 02:07.239
I appreciate your not telling
him that we slept together once.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.031
Hasn't come up.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.345
Diego was trying to figure out
how to take care of two kids

02:13.390 --> 02:14.255
while Lizzie was away.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.166
I'll be just fine

02:16.220 --> 02:18.860
Thank you, Frank.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.264
Sure you don't want me
to babysit?

02:21.310 --> 02:23.358
The last time you did that,

02:23.400 --> 02:24.561
Fiona ended up
in the hospital.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.657
Well, that is
not gonna happen.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.132
Oow!

02:28.190 --> 02:30.318
I won't let anyone tell me
that I ain't fine

02:30.360 --> 02:33.318
And Wes was trying to make
a living making furniture.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.622
It was his dream.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.627
And it was super sexy.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.889
Oh, hey.

02:38.940 --> 02:42.194
Sawdust all over me.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.709
Oh, wow.
That chair is beautiful.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.636
Seriously, you're
so good at this.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.149
I can't figure out how you
haven't sold anything yet.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.111
Mm. Maybe 'cause there's
three handmade furniture shops

02:52.170 --> 02:53.467
on Main Street alone.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.386
Well, I believe in you.

02:55.430 --> 02:56.864
You will make it happen.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.298
Speaking of making
things happen,

02:58.350 --> 03:00.307
the coffee shop is
opening a new location,

03:00.350 --> 03:02.307
and there's a manager
position available.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.909
I'm gonna apply.That's great, babe.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.916
I know.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.359
And there's
a significant raise.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.301
Oh, that
makes you my sugar mama.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.136
Yeah, it does.
Mm-hmm.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.319
Hi.

03:17.370 --> 03:19.316
Hello.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.407
So, what do I need to apply

03:21.460 --> 03:23.235
for the manager position
at the new location?

03:23.290 --> 03:26.282
Pretty much just one good arm
and a high-school diploma.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.458
Great.
I have both of those things.

03:28.510 --> 03:31.502
Cool. I'm doing the interviews,
so I can vouch for you.

03:31.550 --> 03:33.689
I just need you to
fill out a packet

03:33.730 --> 03:36.290
and get me a copy
of your diploma.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.775
Thank you for being SO
supportive. No problem.

03:38.820 --> 03:42.609
I love the thought of you
not working here anymore.

03:42.650 --> 03:45.517
You ruined a nice moment.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.569
We had moved out
of the old house,

03:49.620 --> 03:52.134
but I had some boxes
I hadn't picked up yet.

03:52.180 --> 03:53.397
Hey, little sis.
Whatcha doing here?

03:53.450 --> 03:56.351
I'm looking for my
high-school diploma.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.536
You know, I can't believe

03:57.580 --> 03:58.615
that, with everything
I went through,

03:58.670 --> 04:01.924
I still found time
to graduate.

04:01.980 --> 04:05.325
Neither can I.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.496
Why are you talking
like that?

04:06.550 --> 04:07.938
What are you not telling me?

04:07.980 --> 04:09.323
I think this is a conversation
you should have with Dad

04:09.370 --> 04:11.452
or Mom or anyone but me.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.933
Aiden...

04:13.990 --> 04:16.812
Have you ever really taken
a good look at that thing?

04:16.860 --> 04:18.293
No. Why?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.642
"Honorary"?

04:24.690 --> 04:26.089
Oh, my God.
Are you saying

04:26.130 --> 04:27.689
that I didn't graduate
from high school?

04:27.740 --> 04:29.731
No, you're saying that.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.599
But I am not disagreeing
with you.

04:35.530 --> 04:38.443
Don't worry about a thing

04:38.490 --> 04:42.142
You'll learn to live again

04:42.190 --> 04:44.056
You're gonna learn
to live again

04:44.100 --> 04:49.550
Oh, oh, oh

04:49.590 --> 04:50.978
I need another beer.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.363
You want one?

04:52.420 --> 04:53.376
It's 10:00 a.m.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.548
I know.
I can tell time.

04:55.590 --> 04:58.412
I graduated.

04:58.470 --> 05:00.336
God, I cannot believe
that Mom and Dad

05:00.380 --> 05:01.552
lied to me about this, too.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.295
It was Dad's idea.

05:03.340 --> 05:04.683
This really sucks.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.869
Yeah, I can't imagine what
it'd feel like to find out

05:06.910 --> 05:08.469
that all my accomplishments
were fake.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.340
Actually, I can't imagine
what it would feel like

05:10.390 --> 05:11.994
to have accomplishments.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.529
Wait. What do you mean,
they're allfake?

05:13.570 --> 05:16.562
Is there anything that
they didn't lie to me about?

05:16.620 --> 05:17.519
You are
their biological daughter.

05:17.570 --> 05:20.039
Oh, my God.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.000
Well...

05:22.060 --> 05:24.961
So, I didn't really win
the science fair?

05:25.020 --> 05:27.443
Stella, you kept
a moldy potato as a pet.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.309
Well...

05:29.370 --> 05:32.408
Well, what about this
stupid pie

05:32.460 --> 05:33.541
Oh, yeah.
Did I win that?

05:33.590 --> 05:35.319
Yeah, that is real.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.543
But I think the medical
marijuana should have counted

05:37.590 --> 05:39.410
as a performance-enhancing
drug.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.546
How am I supposed to start
the next chapter of my life

05:42.600 --> 05:44.853
if I never even finished
the last one?

05:44.900 --> 05:46.550
Oh, I'm gonna kill Dad.

05:47.210 --> 05:51.477
Well, I definitely
want to see that.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.738
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

05:55.790 --> 05:58.043
You didn't tell me
they were stopping by.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.649
Diego: Grandma.I didn't know.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.088
-Hey!
-Hi!

06:01.140 --> 06:03.040
Uh, any chance you could
watch these guys today?

06:03.100 --> 06:04.829
I got sales calls all afternoon,
and Stella said

06:04.880 --> 06:06.666
she was gonna tag in later,
but I'm kinda stuck.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.576
Actually, we're on our way
to a pottery class...

06:08.620 --> 06:11.408
which, of course,
plans can change.

06:11.450 --> 06:12.497
We would love
to watch them.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.451
Oh, amazing.
Okay, I owe you one.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.843
I'll be back as soon
as I can, okay?

06:15.890 --> 06:17.142
Just be good for Grandma.
-Bye.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.237
Okay, come on,
you little nuggets.

06:19.290 --> 06:20.416
Let's go play.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.849
How do two women
make a baby?

06:22.900 --> 06:25.073
Oh, well,
this should be fun.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.633
You got a solid C.

06:26.690 --> 06:30.297
I can't give you a higher grade,
because you didn't earn it.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.729
Why did you forge
my high

06:32.780 --> 06:34.908
Uh, we'll talk
about this later, okay?

06:35.650 --> 06:37.778
Please tell me the truth.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.787
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

06:39.830 --> 06:43.346
That would be an awesome title
for my autobiography.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.435
What's he doing here?

06:44.490 --> 06:45.525
He is enjoying the scenery

06:45.570 --> 06:47.049
and then hitching
a ride to Marlene's.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.310
Hey, ladies.
I didn't say "class dismissed."

06:51.360 --> 06:53.886
I'm trying to get a management
position at the coffee shop,

06:53.930 --> 06:55.887
but I can't because
my diploma's worthless.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.841
Honey,
I'm sorry we lied to you.

06:57.890 --> 07:00.678
Let's just apply that
across the board.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.372
We wanted you to have as much
of a normal life as you could.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.854
I get it.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.029
But from on now, please let me
earn things on my own...

07:09.080 --> 07:10.423
for real.

07:10.470 --> 07:13.076
No more fake trophies
for moldy potatoes, okay?

07:13.120 --> 07:15.555
Deal.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.251
I would love to go
to the sorority mixer.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.120
I got to check on
my baby mama real quick.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.649
How late is it going?Woman: 2:00.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.179
I'm gonna try and make it.Mm-hmm.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.480
This is Marlene's house?

07:28.530 --> 07:29.486
Is she rich?

07:29.530 --> 07:30.611
Apparently.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.912
I had no idea.

07:31.970 --> 07:33.745
We always do it at our house
or the bathroom

07:33.800 --> 07:35.313
at the place
she gets her nails done.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.577
Oh.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.314
Oh, hey,
if it's cool with you,

07:38.370 --> 07:42.068
I'm gonna keep this thing on in
case her husband's still here.

07:42.110 --> 07:43.498
Good luck.

07:46.590 --> 07:47.933
So, he

07:47.980 --> 07:50.540
Yeah, he just packed up
his stuff and got out.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.501
Whew! I'm surprised
he'd walk away from all this.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.369
I mean, you...

07:55.430 --> 07:56.647
and all of this.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.590
Yeah, well, he wants
nothing to do with me.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.516
Or this baby.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.994
And it's my house.

08:03.170 --> 08:06.561
I run a multi-level
marketing skin care company.

08:06.610 --> 08:07.953
That's batter.
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.958
I just have to live here
all by myself,

08:13.400 --> 08:16.620
You know...if you are
going to be lonely,

08:16.670 --> 08:19.799
I could maybe just...
move in with you.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.399
If my baby's going to be
living here,

08:21.450 --> 08:23.669
it makes sense for me
to be close by.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.620
You would do that for me?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.149
Absolutely.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.326
I'm a giver.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.453
Do you want to go
for a swim?

08:32.510 --> 08:34.023
We have a pool?

08:34.070 --> 08:35.720
Stop it!

08:42.780 --> 08:43.679
Ohh.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.730
Hey, you.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.647
Hi.
What's all this for?

08:47.700 --> 08:50.306
I'm studying for my GED.

08:50.350 --> 08:51.340
GED?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.561
I thought you graduated
high school.

08:52.610 --> 08:53.566
So did I.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.520
It's a whole thing.

08:55.570 --> 08:56.787
You okay?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.001
No.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.529
I mean, I knew
I was way behind in life,

08:59.580 --> 09:00.741
but thanks to my dad,

09:00.800 --> 09:02.450
I'm even further behind
than I thought.

09:02.490 --> 09:04.754
If I want this manager
position, I need my GED,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.314
like, yesterday.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.496
Ugh!

09:08.540 --> 09:10.588
Why is trigonometry so hard?

09:10.630 --> 09:12.712
Well, you know,
I'm pretty good with numbers.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.807
Well, that makes one of us.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.807
You want to help me study?Sure.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.727
Okay, let's start
with functions.

09:17.770 --> 09:19.670
What are they?

09:19.730 --> 09:22.859
Well, in trigonometry,
the function relates

09:22.910 --> 09:25.163
the angle of the triangle
to...

09:38.830 --> 09:41.219
Mm...

09:51.190 --> 09:52.191
Wes: I know.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.537
It's nice to "see you,"
as well.

09:53.590 --> 09:54.751
Wes?

09:54.810 --> 09:57.233
I can't believe
it's been eight months.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.713
I don't believe you.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.023
Okay, well,
why don't you show me?

10:02.070 --> 10:04.767
That's it.
Show me everything.

10:04.820 --> 10:05.946
Oh, that isbad.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.685
All right, hold it there.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.778
Just let me finish.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.642
Nice. Oh!

10:12.690 --> 10:15.000
What the hell
is going on in here?!

10:15.040 --> 10:16.257
Who the hell are you?!

10:16.310 --> 10:17.732
Who the bloody hell are you?

10:17.790 --> 10:20.748
I asked you first,
sexy British lady!

10:28.750 --> 10:30.013
Who are you?

10:30.060 --> 10:31.619
My name is Linda.

10:31.670 --> 10:32.887
Well, back off, Linda.

10:32.930 --> 10:33.920
This is my husband.All right, Stella, stop.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.664
You're spiraling.
Am I?

10:35.720 --> 10:37.449
Because I think I'm having
a perfectly normal reaction

10:37.500 --> 10:39.150
to you cyber-sexing some woman
in the middle of the night.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.759
No, no, no. Linda's
a wealth-management client

10:40.810 --> 10:41.766
of mine in London.

10:41.810 --> 10:43.505
It's morning there.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.200
Why would you think
that we were cyber

10:45.250 --> 10:46.763
Because he's not
wearing any pants.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.073
What?!I only dress up the part
that's on camera.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.554
Sorry.
Oh.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.079
Do you just want
to maybe call me back?

10:52.120 --> 10:53.554
Yes, thank you.
I will.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.477
Thank you.
sorry.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.079
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you --

10:57.130 --> 10:59.599
But I rescued you
from finance.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.527
You said you hated that job.

11:01.570 --> 11:02.958
Well, "hate's" a strong word.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.308
And they say you don't miss
something till it's gone.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.260
You missed
wealth management?

11:07.310 --> 11:08.869
I missed being good
at something, Stells.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.968
You're good at wood.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.092
Chairs.
Wood chairs.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.369
Yeah, well, you're the only
one who seems to think so.

11:15.410 --> 11:17.720
Plus, I like knowing
that I was helping take care

11:17.760 --> 11:19.194
of our little family.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.015
I'm getting
that manager job.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.549
I know you are.
I do.

11:22.590 --> 11:26.322
But until you do,
I can help us get by.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.078
Okay.
Okay.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.337
All right, thank you.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.828
Hey, Pops.
What's with the box?

11:44.870 --> 11:47.009
Just some more stuff
from the house.

11:47.050 --> 11:50.042
Hey...I know I said
that we were all adults

11:50.100 --> 11:53.445
and things shouldn't be
weird with Lauren here,

11:53.490 --> 11:56.881
but, uh...they are.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.750
They really are.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.110
Your bedroom doesn't have
a wall on it.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.884
So I think it might be best

12:03.940 --> 12:06.807
if you found
somewhere else to live.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.761
Found it.
And it has a pool.

12:08.810 --> 12:11.768
So if you want to take a dip,
feel free to come on over.

12:11.810 --> 12:12.936
Over to where?

12:12.990 --> 12:14.242
Marlene's.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.759
- She also has
a rain shower and a sauna.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.857
And she's kinda cool.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.901
I never really bothered
to talk to her much,

12:20.950 --> 12:23.510
but I think she's going
to be a good mom.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.255
I guess I'm happy for you.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.950
I'm gonna miss this place.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.650
Take good care of it.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.919
Word of warning -- The hot water
never really gets past warm,

12:30.960 --> 12:32.951
and there's
a small rodent problem.

12:33.010 --> 12:35.911
The problem is small,
or the rodents are small?

12:35.970 --> 12:36.960
You'll find out.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.405
See ya 'round, Pops.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.919
You may now
"bang in peace."

12:49.890 --> 12:53.326
Dude, I am so glad
that you finally decided

12:53.380 --> 12:54.802
to come play
kickball with me.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.021
Yeah, man.

12:56.070 --> 12:58.380
Tell me again, though --
What is kickball?

12:58.420 --> 13:01.947
Okay, basically, it's soccer
mixed with baseball

13:01.990 --> 13:05.949
mixed with dodgeball
mixed with beer.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.217
Yeah,
I don't know about this.

13:07.260 --> 13:08.603
Oh, you're gonna love it.

13:08.650 --> 13:10.436
Plus, I-I think
it'll be good for you

13:10.480 --> 13:12.869
to work out some of
that stress, you know?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.217
I'm not stressed.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.739
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

13:16.790 --> 13:18.303
Oh-oh-oh

13:18.360 --> 13:23.309
I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do

13:23.360 --> 13:25.829
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

13:25.890 --> 13:27.403
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah!

13:27.450 --> 13:32.411
I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do

13:33.760 --> 13:34.932
Ohh!

13:38.990 --> 13:41.413
Hey!

13:41.470 --> 13:42.767
Hey!

13:47.910 --> 13:51.699
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
la-la-la

13:51.740 --> 13:54.300
Stella: I hated that Wes had
to go back to his old job.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.864
But the good news was,
I was feeling pretty confident

13:56.920 --> 13:58.570
about my GED.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.042
Hello, Earth to barista.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.046
I'd like a half caf,
please.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.831
Hi. Sorry.
I was just studying...

14:04.880 --> 14:07.747
Wait.
Heidi Lynn Brennan?

14:07.800 --> 14:10.110
Stella Jane Abbott?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.311
From 9th grade?

14:11.370 --> 14:13.020
Aren't you supposed
to be dead?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.585
I was.

14:14.630 --> 14:17.895
But here I am.
Living the dream.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.499
Oh.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.769
Would you mind?

14:21.810 --> 14:24.507
So, you beat cancer,

14:24.550 --> 14:26.723
and now you work
in a coffee shop.

14:26.770 --> 14:29.080
Well, I don't just work here.
I'm the manager.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.124
There's a dead rat by the
Dumpster with your name on it.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.217
Well, I will be.

14:33.260 --> 14:35.388
I'm up for a promotion.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.250
But what about you?
What are you up to?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.914
I'm a particle physicist.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.995
We're working on taking data

14:40.050 --> 14:41.609
from the highest
energy collisions

14:41.660 --> 14:44.698
in the Large Hadron Collider
to "rediscover"” the Higgs boson.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.741
Sub-particles
are kind of my jam.

14:46.790 --> 14:50.272
And I guess...
coffee grinds are yours.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.833
Yeah.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.699
I should get going.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.921
It was nice seeing you.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.846
Yeah!

14:56.890 --> 14:58.847
Really good seeing you, too.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.153
Was it?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.634
Or was it soul

15:02.680 --> 15:04.546
It was kind of that.

15:04.590 --> 15:06.934
I can't believe the girl
named Most Likely to Eat Paint

15:06.990 --> 15:08.947
is now a physicist.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.207
That's a great story.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.810
You know who'd love
to hear all about that?

15:12.860 --> 15:14.294
That dead rat.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.990
Also, I need your application
by end of day tomorrow

15:16.040 --> 15:17.383
if you still want that gig.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.864
Don't forget to list
some references.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.607
Oh. Wait. I thought
you were vouching for me.

15:21.650 --> 15:25.041
It would have been easy to ask Dr. Grant for a recommendation,

15:25.090 --> 15:28.139
but I was avoiding him
for obvious reasons.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.739
How long you been married?Six months.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.440
It's a shame I didn't meet you
seven months ago.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.181
I figured my old oncologist
was the perfect reference.

15:36.230 --> 15:38.141
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

15:38.190 --> 15:39.715
Have you seen
Dr. Chang?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.148
Uh, she's on vacation.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.759
Bummer.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.710
I was hoping she could write
a recommendation letter

15:44.760 --> 15:47.115
for this manager position
at the coffee shop.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.241
Do you need a recommendation
for that?

15:48.290 --> 15:50.463
You wouldn't think so,
but yes.

15:50.510 --> 15:53.855
Also, I...

15:53.900 --> 15:55.641
brought you something.

15:59.430 --> 16:01.296
I don't think
we have a pool here.

16:01.350 --> 16:06.299
See, you put them
on the rails of your bed

16:06.350 --> 16:08.170
so you don't bump up
against the metal.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.689
Oh.
That's actually kinda cool.

16:10.750 --> 16:11.911
Thanks.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.098
Yeah, I don't like
to show up empty-handed.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.448
What's that?

16:15.490 --> 16:18.835
Oh, I'm trying
to get my GED.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.700
Wish I could help, but I
haven't started high school yet.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.103
Just make sure
that you finish.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.629
And get proof.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.456
My family pretended that
I graduated from high school

16:26.500 --> 16:28.457
just for the photo op.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.810
It seems like people lie
a lot when you're sick.

16:30.850 --> 16:33.547
Like, you're probably gonna die
anyway, so what's the point?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.079
Exactly.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.077
But you know what the best way
to get back at them is?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.987
Don't die.

16:41.260 --> 16:44.082
Ugh. I forgot how much
I hate the food here.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.347
It's the worst.

16:45.390 --> 16:47.119
I used to tell them
that it made me sicker

16:47.180 --> 16:49.217
than the chemo and demand that
they bring me Chinese takeout.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.261
Really?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.391
No.
But I thought it.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.431
My inner monologue's
pretty fierce.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.049
I'll tell you what.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.263
Tomorrow I will bring you
something edible for dinner.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.617
How 'bout a burger?

16:59.670 --> 17:01.968
Done.
I'll even throw in a milkshake.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.226
I'm lactose intolerant.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.839
Oh.
Good to know.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.403
No cheese on the burger.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.404
Bye!

17:07.460 --> 17:10.281
Bye.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.106
Good game, man.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.152
So, no stress, huh?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.247
Nope.

17:17.290 --> 17:18.894
Really?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.203
You can talk to me, man.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.071
I hate my job.
Every second of it.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.166
Okay.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.165
There he is.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.904
So, why are
you even doing it?

17:28.960 --> 17:32.567
Because, man, taking care
of Stella is my top priority.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.738
So if that means I have
to go back into finance,

17:34.790 --> 17:36.269
then that's what I've got
to do.

17:36.310 --> 17:37.618
Family first.
I respect that.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.220
I mean, I've just been
seeing one client.

17:40.270 --> 17:41.522
She made a few calls
on my behalf,

17:41.580 --> 17:43.264
and now this firm
wants to offer me

17:43.320 --> 17:45.789
a full-time consulting gig.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.887
So, you gonna take it?

17:46.930 --> 17:49.103
I don't know,
'cause if I do, it means

17:49.150 --> 17:51.585
I wouldn't have time
to build furniture anymore.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.847
It...

17:52.890 --> 17:54.369
Maybe I'm just not
the sort of guy

17:54.420 --> 17:56.809
who gets to follow
his dream, you know?

17:56.850 --> 17:58.989
I mean, maybe I'm the sort
of guy who gets to help

17:59.030 --> 18:01.544
someone else follow theirs.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.558
That is something
that I can relate to.

18:08.340 --> 18:09.865
Thanks for this, man.

18:09.910 --> 18:12.163
I'm telling you,
being able to talk to someone

18:12.220 --> 18:13.290
about this kind of stuff...

18:13.350 --> 18:15.045
I'm always here for you.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.956
I'm not sure if the guys want
you back on the kickball field,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.220
but any time you want
to grab a beer...

18:20.270 --> 18:22.352
I'm your guy, all right?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.652
Appreciate that.
Yeah.

18:23.710 --> 18:25.576
Mm.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.839
A little piece of advice
from someone who's been married

18:27.880 --> 18:30.144
a little bit longer
than you... Mm-hmm.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.238
...don't just talk to me
about this stuff, all right?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.055
Talk to your wife, too.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.327
Trust me.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.767
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

18:45.820 --> 18:48.243
Uh, Marlene has
an ultrasound appointment.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.109
Oh. Isn't he a doll
for coming with me?

18:50.170 --> 18:53.208
Well, he is the father,
so less of a "doll"

18:53.260 --> 18:54.864
and more of a "duh,
he should be here."

18:54.910 --> 18:57.607
See? I'm killing it
at this father thing.

18:57.650 --> 18:59.789
I've even started
designing the nursery.

18:59.830 --> 19:02.265
You guys
are getting pretty cozy.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.221
Well,
we are living together.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.307
Oh.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.010
So that happened.

19:08.050 --> 19:09.358
Yes, it did.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.926
I don't want to be late,
so I'm gonna go in.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.234
Do you want to see
the baby, Stella?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.009
We were thinking about you
being the godmother.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.280
And this is baby's
first big moment!

19:19.330 --> 19:21.196
Wow. Um...

19:21.240 --> 19:22.457
How could I say no?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.844
You can't.
I'll see you in there.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.502
<i>Hey!
Ow!</i>

19:28.550 --> 19:29.688
Don't you think
it's a little soon

19:29.730 --> 19:30.947
to be shacking up
with Marlene?

19:30.990 --> 19:32.549
A week ago, you were
hiding from her.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.250
Times have changed.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.075
I'm a grown-up now, Stella.

19:36.130 --> 19:38.383
Aiden, this is a huge step.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.602
Don't do it for
the wrong reasons.

19:39.650 --> 19:42.642
I'm totally in control
of the situation.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.999
O.B.:
There's the heart.

19:48.530 --> 19:51.261
And there is the heartbeat.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.669
Aiden;
That's our baby.

20:05.550 --> 20:06.938
You want to get married?

20:06.980 --> 20:08.288
Oh, my God, Aiden!

20:08.330 --> 20:09.411
Oh, my God, Aiden.

20:09.460 --> 20:10.598
Yes!
Yeah?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.369
Yes!

20:14.250 --> 20:15.809
I can't believe it.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.203
O.B.: I can.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.254
Proposals happen in here
more often than you'd think.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.489
Okay.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.044
I hate to break this up,
but I need a urine sample.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.785
Bathroom's right this way.
I'll show you.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.399
Okay.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.534
We should have a -- a barbecue
at my place tomorrow

20:42.580 --> 20:44.139
so I can tell everyone
the good news.

20:44.190 --> 20:45.271
Is it good news?

20:45.330 --> 20:47.139
Or is it totally insane,
Aiden?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.417
You barely know her.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.541
You barely knew Wes.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.456
That is
not the same thing.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.239
Wes is the love
of my life.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.543
I knew it from the minute
that I met him.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.897
You don't love her.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.339
The minute I heard
that heartbeat, Stell,

20:59.380 --> 21:02.293
it took my breath away.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.466
Who knows?

21:03.520 --> 21:05.989
Maybe Marlene and I
will fall in love,

21:06.040 --> 21:07.906
and maybe we won't.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.657
But at least I'll be able
to look my kid in the eye

21:10.700 --> 21:13.749
and say, "I tried."

21:13.790 --> 21:16.225
I have to admit,
I'm conflicted.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.090
On one hand, I think you're
making a huge mistake,

21:18.140 --> 21:21.576
but on the other, I'm
actually kind of proud of you.

21:21.620 --> 21:24.362
So, you'll keep it secret
till the barbecue?

21:24.410 --> 21:26.310
Oh, Dad's head
is going to explode.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.531
I know.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.319
I'm counting on it.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.543
Look at us, hmm?

21:31.590 --> 21:32.842
Getting our lives started...

21:32.900 --> 21:36.063
me with my oops baby
and you with your GED.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.761
Yeah, we're just
a couple of overachievers.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.503
Woman: You may begin.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.813
You have three hours to finish.

21:44.860 --> 21:46.680
It had been a long time

21:46.740 --> 21:49.346
since I had to take
a standardized test.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.563
I actually used to be
pretty good at them.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.610
At least, I thought I was.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.480
But maybe I wasn't.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.840
I mean, my parents lied to me
about everything,

22:02.880 --> 22:05.406
so maybe I was never
really good at them at all.

22:21.290 --> 22:22.985
Look at me.

22:23.030 --> 22:25.761
I'm such
a confident little idiot.

22:27.730 --> 22:30.427
I thought I was such a genius.

22:32.430 --> 22:33.909
But, nope.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.821
It was all a lie.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.736
The only thing I knew
for sure --

22:39.790 --> 22:42.521
There was no way
I could pass this test.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.879
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.399
Hey!

22:49.450 --> 22:50.531
How'd it go?

22:50.580 --> 22:52.491
Not good.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.850
So, the next time
you should check to see

22:54.890 --> 22:56.972
if there's something to
celebrate before spending money

22:57.020 --> 22:59.364
we don't have
to celebrate me passing a test

22:59.420 --> 23:00.672
I couldn't even take.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.506
What do you mean,
you couldn't even take it?

23:02.550 --> 23:04.279
I froze.

23:04.330 --> 23:05.855
I choked.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.028
High-school math was hard enough
when I was in high school,

23:08.080 --> 23:10.594
but eight years later, it
is pretty much impossible.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.720
Okay.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.771
It's not the end
of the world, okay?

23:13.820 --> 23:15.208
You didn't even need
that job.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.774
Plus, to be honest,
an extra $4 an hour

23:17.830 --> 23:19.480
wasn't gonna make much
of a difference around here.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.999
It wasn't just about
the money, Wes.

23:21.050 --> 23:22.609
It was about proving
to myself

23:22.660 --> 23:24.003
that I could do
something for myself,

23:24.050 --> 23:26.178
without everyone having
to help me all the time.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.609
I know,
and you will, okay?

23:34.190 --> 23:36.841
In the meantime,
I have been offered

23:36.890 --> 23:39.052
a full-time
consulting position.

23:39.110 --> 23:40.885
Now, I know it's not
what you wanted for me,

23:40.940 --> 23:42.544
but it means
I can support us --

23:42.590 --> 23:44.103
No, you can't.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.151
You hate that world, and
I won't let you go back to it.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.850
You won't let me
go back to it?

23:47.900 --> 23:51.370
Stella, look, my savings
aren't going anymore, okay?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.818
They're gone.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.203
They're done,
so it's time for us

23:54.250 --> 23:55.593
to start living
in the real world.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.550
I'm trying to start living
in the real world,

23:57.610 --> 23:59.476
but it's a little hard
when you're trying

23:59.520 --> 24:00.908
to protect me from it.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.213
I am not trying
to protect you from it.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.603
Really?
Yes.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.219
Then why did you give up
on your dream to support me?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.693
And why did you lie
to me about it?

24:08.750 --> 24:10.479
I will figure something out.

24:10.530 --> 24:11.702
I survived cancer, Wes.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.184
I can handle real life.

24:13.230 --> 24:14.789
Fine. So, let's say
that I quit my job

24:14.840 --> 24:16.660
and we lose the apartment.

24:16.710 --> 24:19.839
How are
you gonna handle that?

24:19.890 --> 24:21.585
Do you know what's worse
than doing a job

24:21.630 --> 24:23.325
- I don't love
just to support us?

24:23.370 --> 24:25.589
It's knowing that you would
resent me for doing that.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.359
What

24:30.550 --> 24:32.109
It's the real world
calling.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.242
I have to work.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.384
Usually when Wes and I fight,

24:43.430 --> 24:45.740
we don't speak to each other
the next day,

24:45.780 --> 24:48.249
so I thought I'd try
something different.

24:48.310 --> 24:49.436
Morning.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.823
Hey.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.565
Something that moved me now

24:53.620 --> 24:55.702
Were you up all night
working?

24:55.750 --> 24:57.570
Yeah.

24:57.620 --> 24:58.576
Look, I'm sorry.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.884
I shot straight as an arrow

25:00.930 --> 25:03.627
I don't resent you,
and I...

25:03.670 --> 25:06.753
I appreciate what you're
doing to support us.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.418
Thank you.

25:10.460 --> 25:14.192
And, Stells, I'm sorry
I lied to you. Again.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.117
It's a habit
I have to break.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.549
You still gonna walk me
to work?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.819
Yeah.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.520
Yeah, I could use
a cup of coffee,

25:25.560 --> 25:27.904
I've got my head
in the clouds

25:27.960 --> 25:30.258
Oh, my love,
love is beginning now

25:30.310 --> 25:31.869
Resolving things
felt a lot better

25:31.920 --> 25:34.389
than leaving things unsaid.

25:34.440 --> 25:38.570
But we weren't
exactly back in sync.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.875
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

25:42.930 --> 25:47.049
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

25:47.110 --> 25:49.272
Oh, oh

25:49.330 --> 25:53.710
Oh, my love,
love is beginning

25:53.760 --> 25:58.414
We have found
something worth living for

25:58.460 --> 26:02.374
I've got my head
in the clouds

26:02.430 --> 26:06.594
Oh, my love,
love is beginning

26:06.650 --> 26:12.737
Oh, my love,
love is beginning now

26:15.090 --> 26:17.081
I'm not gonna lie --
It was weird

26:17.140 --> 26:20.519
going to a family function
at Marlene's McMansion.

26:20.570 --> 26:23.039
It was also weird
showing up alone.

26:23.100 --> 26:25.228
There she is!
Oh. Hi.

26:25.270 --> 26:27.489
So, while Aiden played host...

26:27.540 --> 26:28.621
Damn it!

26:28.670 --> 26:30.752
...] went to go find Mom.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.451
So, that's where
my khakis went.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.491
I wanted to look nice
for today.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.541
Well, you certainly do.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.943
Ahh!

26:44.990 --> 26:47.300
Look, I know you think
this is about the house,

26:47.340 --> 26:48.159
and it was.

26:48.210 --> 26:49.723
But now it's about our kid.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.646
I wanna be here when she
brings him or her home.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.738
I think it's important.Oh, it isimportant.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.738
I'm sorry. Did you
just agree with me?

26:56.780 --> 26:57.918
Wow!

26:57.960 --> 26:59.348
This dad thing suits me.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.789
I think I'm gonna be
pretty darn good at it.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.652
Before we had you all,
I thought that, too.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.576
Yeah.

27:06.620 --> 27:09.533
The first part of being
a good dad is just showing up.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.355
And you're doing that.

27:12.410 --> 27:14.230
Thanks.

27:15.890 --> 27:18.063
Wow.
This is embarrassing.

27:18.110 --> 27:19.760
We all wore
our dad pants.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.850
Ida: You don't have to
feel guilty

27:23.900 --> 27:26.858
about Wes making sacrifices
for you, Stell.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.766
Marriage
is a give and take.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.549
It's like
Lizzie and Diego.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.295
She helped him when
he was in college,

27:32.340 --> 27:34.422
and now he's supporting her,
and he's not upset.

27:34.470 --> 27:36.120
Yeah, maybe not at her,
but he threatens to kill me

27:36.170 --> 27:38.298
every time he seems me.

27:38.350 --> 27:42.435
I just wish it felt like
Wes' sacrifice was worth it.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.265
Oh.

27:43.310 --> 27:44.869
Frank!
Come on, buddy!

27:44.920 --> 27:46.081
Careful.
Ah!

27:46.140 --> 27:47.869
I'm seriously
gonna kill you.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.445
Frank!
Wow.

27:49.490 --> 27:50.525
Stop it!

27:51.880 --> 27:53.052
Aiden: Attention, please!

27:53.100 --> 27:56.092
May I have
everyone's attention?

27:56.150 --> 27:58.573
All right, you're all
probably wondering why Marlene

27:58.630 --> 28:00.667
and I asked you here today.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.714
Now, I know we've only known
each other two months,

28:04.770 --> 28:05.760
but given the circumstances --

28:05.810 --> 28:06.800
We're getting married!

28:06.850 --> 28:08.932
Yeah!

28:11.550 --> 28:13.814
Hey, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.589
Did I miss anything?Mm. Yeah.

28:15.650 --> 28:18.551
You most certainly did.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.601
So?

28:19.650 --> 28:21.084
What do you think, guys?

28:21.130 --> 28:24.953
We think, in life, it's always
better to be optimistic.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.650
-Mm.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.952
We hope so.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.650
-It is a beautiful ring.
-Oh, thank you.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.179
So, did you really
buy her that ring?

28:32.230 --> 28:33.652
No, she's keeping
her old one.

28:33.710 --> 28:35.269
It's super dope, right?

28:35.320 --> 28:36.970
Romantic.

28:37.010 --> 28:39.798
Check it out -- my baby.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.626
-Aiden, sweetie.
-Oh.

28:41.670 --> 28:43.229
-So sweet.
-Marlene.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.011
Peter: Stell Belle,
I almost forgot.

28:46.070 --> 28:48.539
I have something
for you.

28:48.590 --> 28:49.500
What's this?

28:49.550 --> 28:52.850
It's your
high-school diploma.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.288
I-I don't understand.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.899
I spoke to your principal.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.464
He owes me a favor 'cause I
helped his son get into college.

28:58.510 --> 29:01.992
Dad, I asked you not to do
these things for me anymore.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.692
Look, I know I'm terrible at
math, but I'm figuring it out.

29:05.740 --> 29:07.435
I'm going to figure it out.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.211
I don't want you to struggle
because of my mistake.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.829
Let me protect you
from that.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.042
Um, this is not gonna
go well for you.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.706
Dad, I just...

29:16.750 --> 29:19.060
I want to start my life
on my own terms.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.829
I don't want to start it out
on a lie.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.053
Speaking of lies...

29:23.100 --> 29:25.011
Aiden showed me
Marlene's sonogram.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.619
He said he's known her
for two months,

29:26.670 --> 29:30.800
but look at the gestational age
in the corner.

29:30.850 --> 29:32.193
This isn't Aiden's baby.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.709
See?
You aregood at math.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.510
Well, this is awkward.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.904
Yeah. Definitely one of
the weirdest family dinners

29:47.960 --> 29:49.086
we've ever had.

29:52.130 --> 29:53.950
Can't believe
it's not my baby.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.174
Maybe it's for the best.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.743
Mm.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.349
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.220
Wes:
So, this is terrible timing...

30:02.270 --> 30:04.318
but I have
a little work emergency.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.234
Bye, babe.
Bye.

30:07.280 --> 30:10.921
So, we, uh, still
making those burgers?

30:12.890 --> 30:15.063
I didn't think so.

30:15.110 --> 30:18.284
Honey, do you need us
to stick around?

30:18.330 --> 30:21.857
No, I think
this is a me problem.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.122
Bye, Mom.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.991
I am
not taking that diploma.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.212
You are so stubborn.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.477
I wonder
who I get that from.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.259
Sweetie,
if you hadn't gotten sick,

30:38.310 --> 30:39.914
you would have earned
all those credits.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.303
But you did get sick.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.226
So I'm just trying to help you
make up for lost time.

30:43.270 --> 30:46.058
I have to learn how to succeed
or fail on my own, Dad.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.182
And it's not always gonna be
pretty, but that's the only way

30:48.230 --> 30:50.756
I'm gonna find out what
I'm good at, or who I am.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.756
You're my little girl.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.972
Not anymore.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.193
You have to let me go,
Dad.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.410
What?

30:59.460 --> 31:00.632
No.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.115
You'll always be
my little girl.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.334
You can't expect me to stop
being your father.

31:06.380 --> 31:10.556
And I'm always gonna try
to help you any way I can.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.989
Well...

31:13.040 --> 31:14.906
I'm not always
gonna like it.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.646
And I'm pretty sure you'll let
me hear about it when you don't.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.782
Okay, give me
the damn envelope.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.353
Why?
You gonna destroy it?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.004
Maybe.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.069
Diego: Hey, Ida.

31:38.110 --> 31:40.329
Okay. Just keep walking.
Pretend you don't hear.

31:40.370 --> 31:42.190
Uh-huh.
Uh, Ida.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.938
Hey. There's this, uh,
with a doctors' association,

31:45.990 --> 31:47.378
and is there any chance
you could watch the kids

31:47.420 --> 31:49.889
for a couple hours?
Three, tops.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.032
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't
an emergency, but...

31:52.080 --> 31:55.163
Of course.
I'm always happy to help.

31:55.210 --> 31:56.257
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.769
Yeah.
Amazing.

31:58.820 --> 32:00.959
Can Grandpa come?

32:01.000 --> 32:01.990
Please?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.779
Pretty please?

32:03.830 --> 32:05.434
Do you have any plans?

32:05.480 --> 32:08.040
Just drinking alone
and moping in the dark.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.909
But I can move that
to tomorrow.

32:11.490 --> 32:13.572
Poppy:
I'll wait for you at home?

32:17.190 --> 32:19.101
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.013
Do we ever get
to stop being parents?

32:23.070 --> 32:24.014
Nope.

32:24.070 --> 32:24.969
Never.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.839
You're a parent for life.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.675
It's like being
on the Supreme Court.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.540
Some days, I glance
in the mirror, and I swear

32:30.600 --> 32:32.284
I look as old
as Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.809
That's ridiculous.

32:34.860 --> 32:36.419
You're thriving.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.334
Thank you for that.

32:40.390 --> 32:42.609
And thank you for
doing this with me.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.039
You think these two will
drive their parents as crazy

32:45.090 --> 32:46.171
as ours drove us?

32:46.220 --> 32:48.086
Oh, God, I hope so.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.041
That's justice.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.442
Instead of destroying
my diploma,

32:54.490 --> 32:58.142
I decided
I'd put it to good use.

32:58.190 --> 33:01.626
Okay, here is my application
and my diploma,

33:01.670 --> 33:03.104
which is totally real,
but between us,

33:03.150 --> 33:05.107
it's not totally real,
but it doesn't even matter.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.800
I was
just a few credits short.

33:06.850 --> 33:09.842
And I know that I can do this
job, but even more than that,

33:09.900 --> 33:12.028
I need this job
to move forward in life

33:12.070 --> 33:14.459
so that my husband's
sacrifice means something.

33:14.510 --> 33:15.409
Sorry.

33:15.470 --> 33:17.120
The job's
already been filled.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.161
No. Really?

33:18.210 --> 33:19.632
Yeah.
And it's too bad.

33:19.690 --> 33:21.647
I was really looking forward
to never seeing you again.

33:21.690 --> 33:23.943
You know, most people
find me pretty likable.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.037
Everybody does. And you
don't even have to try.

33:26.090 --> 33:27.478
It's infuriating.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.830
I used to try,
and still nobody liked me.

33:29.870 --> 33:31.269
So I gave them
a reason not to.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.607
Took my power back.

33:32.660 --> 33:33.650
I like you.

33:33.700 --> 33:34.610
No, you don't.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.219
No, I don't.
You're super mean.

33:36.270 --> 33:37.749
You know, it takes time
to figure out

33:37.790 --> 33:39.189
what you want to do
in life.

33:39.230 --> 33:40.664
And there's really
nothing wrong

33:40.710 --> 33:42.701
with working here
until you do.

33:49.590 --> 33:51.490
Hey.

33:51.550 --> 33:54.064
Hey.

33:54.110 --> 33:57.068
I didn't know
it wasn't yours.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.282
I swear,
I'm not a bad person.

33:59.340 --> 34:01.206
I know
you're not a bad person.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.161
You're a great person,
Marlene.

34:03.210 --> 34:06.293
If you weren't, I wouldn't
have proposed to you.

34:06.340 --> 34:09.161
Right. About that.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.348
Are we...

34:11.389 --> 34:12.994
Yeah, of course not.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.699
Sorry.

34:14.739 --> 34:17.744
I just don't know how
I'm gonna do this alone,

34:17.790 --> 34:20.304
and I really like
your family,

34:20.360 --> 34:23.739
and I don't want to be as --
as bad a mother as mine was.

34:23.800 --> 34:28.179
Hey, you're gonna be
a great mother.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.880
Thank you.
For saying that.

34:30.929 --> 34:35.844
I guess I have to tell
my ex about the baby.

34:35.889 --> 34:37.197
Probably.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.504
Look, just 'cause
we're not together

34:39.550 --> 34:42.985
doesn't mean I'm not gonna be
around when the baby's born.

34:43.030 --> 34:44.338
I can help out.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.259
You're not gonna do that.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.428
Be honest with me.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.693
I'm probably
not gonna do that.

34:57.740 --> 35:02.780
To finally find your way
inside

35:02.830 --> 35:07.222
Hey, could you just stay
and talk for a while?

35:08.620 --> 35:11.089
I could really use
someone to talk to.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.800
Sure.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.233
Don't cry.

35:18.630 --> 35:21.065
You're gonna be okay.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.548
Say hello to my little friend!

35:26.600 --> 35:28.329
Boom!

35:29.690 --> 35:30.987
Okay! Ugh!

35:31.040 --> 35:32.292
Okay.

35:32.340 --> 35:35.071
Okay!
Frank: Yay!

35:35.130 --> 35:36.382
What you guys doing?

35:36.430 --> 35:37.340
Playing "Scarf ace,"

35:37.390 --> 35:39.040
waiting for Diego
to get here.

35:39.090 --> 35:40.251
Mom and Dad were exhausted,

35:40.310 --> 35:42.301
so I said I'd take over,
give 'em a break.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.660
Why don't you guys go inside,
put on a movie?

35:44.700 --> 35:46.179
Something R-rated
and real bloody.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.392
Yes!
Kidding.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.703
Go on.
Together: Aw!

35:53.100 --> 35:55.364
You okay?

35:55.410 --> 35:56.969
I would have been
a good dad.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.669
I know.

36:01.720 --> 36:05.156
It was just nice feeling like
I had a purpose for a second.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.419
Like maybe my life
was finally beginning.

36:07.460 --> 36:08.461
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:08.510 --> 36:10.638
I got this amazing
second chance,

36:10.690 --> 36:12.943
and I can't even get a job
managing a coffee shop.

36:12.990 --> 36:14.549
Do you want to manage
a coffee shop?

36:14.600 --> 36:17.206
No,
but I want to be able to.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.345
You know, I told Dad
that I wanted him

36:20.390 --> 36:21.562
to let me fail on my own,

36:21.610 --> 36:22.953
but now that I know
what it feels like,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.469
I think that I was wrong.Oh, come on.

36:25.530 --> 36:27.396
You don't want to go back
to winning fake trophies

36:27.440 --> 36:28.919
for moldy potatoes?

36:28.960 --> 36:29.870
Mm.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.831
Yeah, you're right.
I don't.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.836
You know, there's
a difference between failing

36:35.880 --> 36:37.097
and being a failure.

36:37.150 --> 36:39.369
You're only a failure
if you give up.

36:39.410 --> 36:41.230
Is that what
you tell yourself?

36:41.280 --> 36:42.497
Every single day.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.847
I just wish I had a dream.
Something to go after.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.153
I mean, the last time I even
let myself think about my dream,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.897
I was 15, and I wanted
to marry Prince Harry.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.374
That is
a handsome ginger.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.331
He's like the Mario Lopez
of gingers.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.246
The man has held up.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.291
He's so hot.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.388
You don't need
some big dream, Stell.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.603
You just need something
that matters to you.

37:07.220 --> 37:09.040
Which reminds me...

37:09.090 --> 37:10.649
I have a sorority mixer
later tonight.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.429
Would you like to join me

37:12.490 --> 37:14.652
I think I will pass.

37:17.230 --> 37:18.356
I have somewhere to be.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.237
That's when I realized
even though it wasn't

37:22.280 --> 37:25.272
technically a job since I didn't get paid a cent,

37:25.330 --> 37:27.492
I was already doing
something that matters.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.804
I'm late.Yeah, I know.

37:29.850 --> 37:31.022
I'm sorry.

37:31.070 --> 37:32.674
Whatever.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.449
Oh.

37:34.510 --> 37:36.467
How is it?

37:36.510 --> 37:38.467
So good.
Whew!

37:38.510 --> 37:39.898
Okay, I was, like,
really worried

37:39.950 --> 37:41.463
that I'd get it
all the way here, and you'd be,

37:41.520 --> 37:42.988
like, not hungry
or too tired

37:43.040 --> 37:44.383
or super mad at me --

37:44.430 --> 37:45.420
It's fine.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.686
I forgive you.

37:46.740 --> 37:48.469
MmMmm.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.909
Want some company?

37:50.960 --> 37:51.950
Sure.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.435
Eating alone kind of sucks.Yeah.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.221
I know.

37:56.270 --> 37:58.352
My family used to visit me
all the time when I was sick,

37:58.400 --> 38:00.710
but some nights, the timing
just didn't work out.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.093
I used to hate eating alone,

38:02.140 --> 38:04.404
but now it actually
sounds kind of nice.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.622
Quiet.

38:05.670 --> 38:08.458
The real world is noisy.

38:11.370 --> 38:13.543
Can I ask
you something?

38:13.590 --> 38:15.149
Anything.
Of course.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.279
How did you get through
the hard times?

38:18.330 --> 38:21.243
Like, how did you believe
you were gonna make it?

38:26.730 --> 38:30.428
I didn't
always believe that.

38:30.480 --> 38:34.439
But I had people
in my life that did.

38:38.090 --> 38:40.696
And so do you.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.572
It's kind of nice to talk to
someone who's been through it.

38:48.630 --> 38:52.180
It's already 8:30.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.583
Hey!
-Hey.

38:53.630 --> 38:54.711
Thank you for coming
to pick me up.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.455
Yeah, of course.
Is everything okay?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.626
Oh, yeah.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.808
I just wanted you to see
that you're not

38:59.850 --> 39:01.852
just making
rich people richer.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.892
And because of you,
I can be there for Sadie

39:04.950 --> 39:07.373
when her aunt can't be,
and I can teach

39:07.430 --> 39:10.513
Allison there seven different
ways to tie a headscarf,

39:10.560 --> 39:13.348
and I can hold Marla's hand
when she does chemo

39:13.390 --> 39:16.121
and remind her that the universe
doesn't make us face anything

39:16.170 --> 39:18.172
that we're not strong
enough to handle.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.437
[ Alexander Cardinale's
"Made for You" playing ]

39:19.480 --> 39:23.394
Never did believe

39:23.440 --> 39:25.784
I'm sorry that
I didn't recognize

39:25.840 --> 39:27.831
what your sacrifice
meant sooner.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.760
I am so happy that I can
help you do this,

39:31.800 --> 39:36.795
and it is okay for us
to lean on each other.

39:36.850 --> 39:38.193
Took a train downtown

39:38.240 --> 39:40.846
Speaking of
leaning on each other,

39:40.900 --> 39:44.370
does that closet over there
look familiar to you?

39:44.420 --> 39:48.334
Is that where we had make-up sex
after Dr. Chang's party?

39:48.380 --> 39:50.769
It is, indeed.

39:50.820 --> 39:54.461
And, you know,
it's always empty.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.510
Come on.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.085
And just like that,

39:57.130 --> 39:59.121
the sun was shining again
just for me.

39:59.170 --> 40:01.252
Oh, oh

40:01.310 --> 40:02.607
Creepy Janitor:
What the hell?!

40:02.660 --> 40:04.048
Not empty.

40:04.090 --> 40:05.694
Sorry,
Creepy Janitor.

40:05.750 --> 40:09.618
Darling, I was made for you

40:11.140 --> 40:13.222
And, sure,
some days were still a grind,

40:13.280 --> 40:14.702
but I didn't care...

40:14.760 --> 40:16.626
Hmm.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.581
Nice work, Abbott. Thank you.

40:18.630 --> 40:21.236
Becky, grab the mop.
The bathroom's flooded.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.590
...because I was
moving forward --

40:23.630 --> 40:24.677
we all were.

40:27.030 --> 40:28.065
Hey, baby.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.589
A whole chapter?
That's amazing.

40:30.640 --> 40:31.983
Ah -- Okay, hold on.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.169
Hey, who wants to talk to Mommy?
Come here.

40:34.210 --> 40:36.520
-Me! M
-Me!e!

40:36.560 --> 40:38.039
Hey, one at a time!

40:38.080 --> 40:39.809
Come here!

40:39.870 --> 40:42.646
And sometimes a step forward
can feel like a step back.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.566
I know
I'm gonna regret this,

40:44.610 --> 40:48.695
but, uh, you want
to live here with me?

40:48.750 --> 40:51.526
Really?
You'd do that?

40:51.570 --> 40:53.652
Thanks, Dad.
It means a lot.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.576
You already moved your stuff in,
didn't you?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.224
Yeah, I did.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.702
But it's not.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.626
Oh, oh, oh

41:00.670 --> 41:02.980
Oh, oh

41:03.020 --> 41:03.794
Hi.

41:03.850 --> 41:05.102
Hey.
What are you doing up?

41:05.150 --> 41:07.232
I thought you could
use some company.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.712
Oh.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.670
You want a spanking?

41:10.720 --> 41:14.463
I do,
but I'm on a call.

41:14.510 --> 41:15.853
Oh!
Hey, Linda.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.369
Hello, Stella.

41:18.430 --> 41:19.682
You're very saucy.

41:19.730 --> 41:21.550
Linda, you mind
if I call you back?

41:21.600 --> 41:22.863
Of course.

41:22.910 --> 41:24.218
Okay.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.433
Okay, I'm ready.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.517
But just because
you're moving forward

41:28.570 --> 41:31.039
it doesn't mean you should
forget where you came from.

41:31.090 --> 41:34.048
Been searching high and low

41:35.620 --> 41:38.317
The one thing that is true

41:38.360 --> 41:42.706
Darling, I was made for you

41:42.760 --> 41:47.402
Oh, I was made for you
