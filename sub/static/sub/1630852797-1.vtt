00:55.513 --> 00:57.594
What's going on, no!

00:57.636 --> 00:58.469

01:32.184 --> 01:33.397
No, no, no!

01:33.439 --> 01:34.896

01:34.938 --> 01:38.290

01:38.332 --> 01:39.332

02:20.373 --> 02:21.206
Oh God!

03:18.892 --> 03:20.311
From Rikers to Atlanta.

03:20.353 --> 03:24.186
It's all the same.

03:41.793 --> 03:44.210
I spent
five years in Rikers Island.

03:44.252 --> 03:46.009
Today I'm being transferred
in a County Jail

03:46.051 --> 03:47.511
in Atlanta, Georgia

03:47.553 --> 03:48.803
to be released.

03:49.921 --> 03:50.965
So I thought it was cool

03:51.007 --> 03:55.007
until I ran into the man
that killed my brother.

03:57.977 --> 04:00.477
And that shit came right back.

04:03.815 --> 04:06.095
Move it, inmate.

04:06.137 --> 04:07.570
Say, bro.

04:07.612 --> 04:10.290
Who the fuck is this nigga?

04:10.332 --> 04:13.415
Blood on my hands is his brother's.

04:33.511 --> 04:34.766
What's up, homie?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.468
They call me Rilla.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.815
I know who you is, big dog.

04:38.857 --> 04:40.107
Just call me E.

04:50.673 --> 04:51.890
That your little man?

04:51.932 --> 04:52.893
Yeah.

04:52.935 --> 04:55.102
Little soccer player, man.

04:56.123 --> 04:59.123
Shit, can't wait to get home to him.

05:00.455 --> 05:02.955
Prison's fucked up, big dog.

05:04.135 --> 05:08.805
My kids not come to see
me a long time ago, man.

05:08.847 --> 05:09.638
You gotta get up outta here, man

05:09.680 --> 05:12.013

07:32.769 --> 07:33.560

with him before.

07:41.193 --> 07:43.034
Look, fuck all that, all right?

07:43.076 --> 07:45.631
Listen, all I need is a stage

07:45.673 --> 07:46.954
and your stamp of approval

07:46.996 --> 07:49.436
and the bag is gonna follow.

07:49.478 --> 07:50.429
Hmm.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.250
You're gonna have to talk to Mr. Denver.

07:52.292 --> 07:53.488
I'll call you tomorrow.

07:53.530 --> 07:54.689
Ain't no need.

07:54.731 --> 07:59.648
Coz we gonna be there tomorrow!

08:31.744 --> 08:34.732
We have a developing
story out of East Atlanta.

08:34.774 --> 08:37.861
Future rap star Rilla has
been shot multiple times

08:37.904 --> 08:40.221
at the popular Turnt studios.

08:40.263 --> 08:41.981
Somehow he survived the attack

08:42.023 --> 08:44.763
only to be arrested hours later.

08:44.805 --> 08:47.888
Now we go to Bill who is on location.

08:49.207 --> 08:51.520
This is a very sad and unfortunate story

08:51.562 --> 08:53.782
because his brother wasn't so lucky.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.119
He too was gunned down earlier this year

08:56.161 --> 08:58.988
and was on the verge of
becoming a rap superstar.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.820
Yes, this is very sad indeed, Bill.

09:01.862 --> 09:05.264
And it raises a very serious question.

09:05.306 --> 09:08.262

10:00.584 --> 10:03.320

10:03.362 --> 10:05.351
Joe right now.

10:05.393 --> 10:07.776
But I think he out tomorrow.

10:07.818 --> 10:09.688
So I think it's gonna
be one of them niggas.

10:09.730 --> 10:10.826
Battle rappers?

10:10.868 --> 10:11.785
Yup, yup.

10:12.942 --> 10:14.229

10:14.271 --> 10:16.285

10:16.327 --> 10:17.815

10:22.545 --> 10:23.712

10:27.610 --> 10:30.434
Fuck but none of that, you feel me?

10:30.476 --> 10:31.726
Nice to know.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.034

10:36.076 --> 10:37.909
Oh, big fella a problem?

10:37.951 --> 10:39.111

10:39.153 --> 10:40.570
Fully loaded ENT.

10:43.867 --> 10:45.189

10:45.231 --> 10:49.484
You know, Russ told
me about your brother.

10:49.526 --> 10:50.923
But Marcus is the money man here

10:50.965 --> 10:52.632
for a lot of people.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.321
He has to be greenlit.

10:56.363 --> 10:58.787
That ain't gonna happen.

10:58.829 --> 10:59.662
Mhmm.

11:00.501 --> 11:01.642
He make the wrong move,

11:01.684 --> 11:04.582
I send him up there with his brother.

11:04.624 --> 11:07.882
In here, it's the fist in the yard.

11:07.924 --> 11:10.967
Out there, it's a bang to the forehead.

11:11.009 --> 11:12.526

11:12.568 --> 11:14.443
My whole
goal is to get home to my son.

11:14.485 --> 11:17.235
But if a nigga's gonna act crazy,

12:00.178 --> 12:03.471

12:03.513 --> 12:05.471
Now you know why I'm here.

12:05.513 --> 12:07.592

I do.

12:13.962 --> 12:16.129
You always was a real one.

12:17.175 --> 12:19.192
You taught me that.

12:19.234 --> 12:21.050
Let me look out for you,

12:21.092 --> 12:24.592
and let your enemies become mine.

12:25.993 --> 12:29.211
You the one that made
me go back to Ladonna.

12:29.253 --> 12:30.810

12:30.852 --> 12:32.709
You was telling me right.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.584
You made me want love.

12:35.892 --> 12:39.336
For the first time my mind was clear.

12:39.378 --> 12:41.295
And I owe you for that.

12:44.350 --> 12:45.749
I'm sorry I ain't come to see you.

12:45.791 --> 12:48.402
I just didn't want to see you locked up.

12:48.444 --> 12:51.750
Pssh, it's all good, it ain't shit.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.542

13:05.851 --> 13:08.929
Oh, no no no, this ain't no handout.

13:08.971 --> 13:10.962
Now I love your ass but

13:11.004 --> 13:12.508
you're gonna have to go
through the same shit

13:12.550 --> 13:14.268
as everybody else.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.824
I wanna sign you to the double R

13:16.866 --> 13:20.050
with a contingency that you
place in Turnt this season.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.342
You know your brother-in-law,

13:21.384 --> 13:24.479

13:24.521 --> 13:25.742
he running it now.

13:25.784 --> 13:27.519
I ain't no rapper, Rita.

13:27.561 --> 13:29.304
Yeah I did see that.

13:29.346 --> 13:30.513
He deserve it.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.429
I mean, you don't have
to be a rapper, Rilla.

13:35.471 --> 13:38.341
You just have to take care
of your family, that's it.

13:38.383 --> 13:40.462
I mean you lost everything.

13:40.504 --> 13:42.462
I didn't lose everything.

13:42.504 --> 13:43.504
My mama did.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.018

13:47.060 --> 13:49.475
She died from the coronavirus.

13:49.517 --> 13:52.408
That put me in a deep place mentally.

13:52.450 --> 13:55.211
So by the time I was being transferred,

13:55.253 --> 13:58.347
I was happy, I was on
my way to see my son.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.795
Then I seen this nigga face,

14:06.576 --> 14:08.171
and all that shit came back to me.

14:13.493 --> 14:16.827
So right now to be honest with you, Rita,

14:16.869 --> 14:19.371
I might not make it out this bitch.

14:19.413 --> 14:20.689
Wait a minute, you're telling me

14:20.731 --> 14:22.321
the nigga that killed Kenny is in here?

14:22.363 --> 14:25.510
Let's go, Stanford.

14:25.552 --> 14:29.642
Rilla, look, he gonna
die in here, you not.

14:29.684 --> 14:30.934
Do you hear me?

14:32.050 --> 14:32.883
Rilla!

14:34.146 --> 14:36.007
Get your mind right and stay focused.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.110
You're not gonna die in here,

14:37.152 --> 14:39.290
you're getting out of
here, do you hear me?!

14:39.332 --> 14:41.036
Bones, motherfucker.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.906
Fuck, man.

14:57.948 --> 14:58.781
Fuck!

15:00.364 --> 15:02.663
Hey, what's up, you good, big dog?

15:02.705 --> 15:04.802
My card ain't working.

15:04.844 --> 15:06.382
Oh, shit, the one from Rikers?

15:06.424 --> 15:07.506
Yeah.

15:07.548 --> 15:08.642
Oh yeah, they canceled Speedcom.

15:08.684 --> 15:09.822
They gave us some new shit.

15:09.864 --> 15:11.666
Everybody all fucked up
right now though, big dog.

15:11.708 --> 15:12.823
- Ain't close.
- Straight up.

15:12.865 --> 15:14.222
I ain't been able to use my phone

15:14.264 --> 15:15.055
this whole year.

15:15.097 --> 15:15.978
Yeah, me neither.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.821
Who you trying to call?

15:17.863 --> 15:19.421
What the fuck you mean?

15:19.463 --> 15:21.279
Chill out, bro.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.521
On the plug.

15:22.563 --> 15:24.201
I'm getting my dude out.

15:24.243 --> 15:25.875
You got a line?

15:25.917 --> 15:27.540
Yeah, I do.

15:27.582 --> 15:29.749
All right, come on, pop.

15:49.966 --> 15:50.919
Take the cares.

15:50.961 --> 15:52.665
I'll get a glass of white wine please.

15:52.707 --> 15:54.166
- Si.
- Thank you.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.375
Vino blanco.

16:06.522 --> 16:07.355
Ola.

16:08.214 --> 16:09.419
Ola, Maggy.

16:09.461 --> 16:10.977
This guy's gonna give you and ready.

16:11.019 --> 16:13.440
You call and give his message.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.047
Si, bueno.

16:15.089 --> 16:16.665
What's the number?

16:16.707 --> 16:18.124
Appreciate you.

16:20.822 --> 16:21.777
Hello?

16:21.819 --> 16:22.652
448553013.

16:47.282 --> 16:48.239
Hello?

16:48.281 --> 16:49.480
Ladonna?

16:49.522 --> 16:51.601
Who's calling?

16:51.643 --> 16:52.476
Hello?

16:54.026 --> 16:55.193
Yeah, it's me.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.684
Yeah they moved me from Atlanta.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.896
Oh that's good, is it better?

16:59.938 --> 17:01.188
Yeah.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.258
The whole
compound know the only person

17:07.300 --> 17:10.259
that got a line out was
Jimenez and his wife.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.944
You know me, I'm staying out the way.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.358
So they watching him.

17:13.401 --> 17:15.164
Which means they watching me.

17:15.205 --> 17:16.708
But I'm ready.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.540
What's up with Kevin?

17:17.583 --> 17:20.396
Oh, my dad went to go
pick him up from school.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.356
Oh, okay.

17:23.058 --> 17:25.003
Let me know-

17:25.046 --> 17:27.463
You ain't good here, nigga.

17:29.738 --> 17:32.779
And you sit or get your
big head ass knocked down.

17:32.821 --> 17:33.654
Hello?

17:36.806 --> 17:37.716
Hello?

17:37.758 --> 17:40.122
My mans already smoked
your ho ass brother.

17:40.164 --> 17:42.141
Fuck is you talking about?

17:47.530 --> 17:49.863
I'm gonna kill this nigga!

18:05.947 --> 18:08.194
Get the fuck down, get the fuck down!

18:08.236 --> 18:09.334
All right, need assistance.

18:09.376 --> 18:10.167
Back off, back off.

18:10.209 --> 18:11.618
Lock it down!

18:11.660 --> 18:15.676
- Rilla, you straight bro?
- Man down, man down.

18:15.718 --> 18:17.635
Mommy, mommy!

18:18.755 --> 18:20.953
- Mommy!
- Kevin, where are you?

18:20.995 --> 18:23.774
It's time for dinner and
mommy can't find you.

18:23.816 --> 18:25.802
I'm in here.

18:25.844 --> 18:26.677
What?

18:29.168 --> 18:31.096
Kevin, come here.

18:31.138 --> 18:33.138
What did I tell you
about playing in there?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.736
It's dangerous and you could get hurt.

18:35.778 --> 18:37.437
If I didn't hear you calling for me

18:37.479 --> 18:39.618
you would have been gone,
what would have happened?

18:39.660 --> 18:42.856
And I would be gone forever?

18:42.898 --> 18:45.092
You don't wanna be
away from mommy, do you?

18:45.134 --> 18:45.967
No.

18:46.818 --> 18:48.373
You're mommy's boy?

18:48.415 --> 18:49.597
Always.

18:49.639 --> 18:51.736
Oh, come here.

18:51.778 --> 18:53.267
All right, listen, go wash your hands

18:53.309 --> 18:55.892
and get ready for dinner, okay?

19:02.456 --> 19:03.873
Hey, baby girl.

19:05.242 --> 19:08.492
One hand, I can't be more proud of you.

19:11.042 --> 19:13.560
Even downright amazed.

19:13.602 --> 19:17.019
Mm, what's on the other hand?

19:19.340 --> 19:22.797
The way you take care
of that boy as your own,

19:22.839 --> 19:24.089
that's amazing.

19:25.955 --> 19:26.746
But...

19:26.788 --> 19:29.021
Dad, like I told you before,

19:29.063 --> 19:30.835
Kevin is a part of Labarius.

19:30.877 --> 19:32.746
All right, I loved him.

19:32.788 --> 19:35.103
You would do the same thing for mom.

19:35.145 --> 19:37.478
Yeah, but we were married.

19:39.042 --> 19:42.792
Plus your mother was no
drug dealing murderer

19:43.887 --> 19:46.658
and damn sure wouldn't
be in anybody's prison,

19:46.700 --> 19:48.459
away from you in the first place.

19:48.501 --> 19:51.260
I don't think he
actually killed anybody.

19:51.302 --> 19:55.156
He just has this, like street persona.

19:55.198 --> 19:57.365
Besides, when he was good,

19:59.143 --> 20:00.643
things were great.

20:01.842 --> 20:03.261
I doubt that.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.500
What about his real mother?

20:05.542 --> 20:06.931
I'll raise she's worse than him.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.802
Hey, you wash them good?

20:08.844 --> 20:09.890
Yes, ma'am!

20:09.932 --> 20:11.517
Pizza, pizza, pizza!

20:11.559 --> 20:12.892
Let's go, boy.

20:29.254 --> 20:32.506
Look, you can't give so much of yourself

20:32.548 --> 20:35.881
that you don't have enough for yourself.

20:37.912 --> 20:41.096
Don't you want a child of your own?

20:41.138 --> 20:43.471
What are you trying to do?

20:44.670 --> 20:45.587
Love you.

20:55.559 --> 20:58.886
♪ It comes too low ♪

20:58.928 --> 21:03.322
♪ Something about the way things end up ♪

21:03.364 --> 21:05.947
Damn, you smoking without me?

21:06.902 --> 21:08.735
What's wrong with you?

21:15.605 --> 21:16.855
First of all,

21:18.864 --> 21:21.447
I almost lost my brother today.

21:23.765 --> 21:26.348
He was almost killed in prison.

21:27.482 --> 21:29.065
Besides this music,

21:30.380 --> 21:32.797
he's all I got in this world.

21:33.730 --> 21:34.521
What you mean?

21:34.563 --> 21:35.480
You got me.

21:37.039 --> 21:38.499
Got you?

21:38.541 --> 21:41.283
You have a son that I don't even know.

21:41.325 --> 21:45.182
And I feel like you
hiding something from me.

21:45.224 --> 21:47.141
But you love me, right?

21:50.184 --> 21:51.017
Yes.

21:53.439 --> 21:54.356
Okay, look.

21:55.657 --> 21:57.401
I have a son.

21:57.443 --> 22:00.326
His name is Kevin, and he's six.

22:00.368 --> 22:02.656
I lost custody of him.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.519
Think about him all the time.

22:05.561 --> 22:08.083
His father's bitch got him.

22:08.125 --> 22:11.375
That's the only reason why I came back.

22:12.361 --> 22:14.201
Now fuck all that.

22:14.243 --> 22:16.410
When your brother get out?

22:17.722 --> 22:19.972
He actually out tomorrow.

22:21.181 --> 22:23.098
I can't wait to see him

22:23.981 --> 22:25.564
back in the studio.

22:27.144 --> 22:29.042
Will you take me to pick him up?

22:29.084 --> 22:31.751
Yeah, anything you want, baby.

22:34.377 --> 22:35.377
Thank you.

22:37.577 --> 22:40.761
And I'm sorry about your son.

22:40.803 --> 22:43.136
I know what that feels like.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.643
Me and my brother was
taken away from my mom

22:46.685 --> 22:48.963
when we were kids.

22:49.005 --> 22:51.005
But she never came back.

22:53.781 --> 22:56.403
So, Jugg raised me,

22:56.445 --> 22:58.643
taught me how to rap,

22:58.685 --> 23:01.435
and everything else in this life.

23:03.746 --> 23:04.537
Yeah, but you know,

23:04.579 --> 23:07.662
there's always room for new teachers.

23:22.056 --> 23:25.264
You know how prison work, nigga?

23:25.306 --> 23:27.139
It's like a ecosystem.

23:28.162 --> 23:30.419
Things run a certain way.

23:30.461 --> 23:33.113
OG, I ain't worried
about none of them niggas.

23:33.155 --> 23:36.061
You know how I made it this long?

23:36.103 --> 23:38.153
By staying out the way.

23:38.195 --> 23:40.415
But I stay in line of the bullshit

23:40.457 --> 23:42.207
that's going on here.

23:43.042 --> 23:47.757
Now, you know you got a
problem with dude out there.

23:47.799 --> 23:50.141
But that was out there.

23:50.183 --> 23:52.579
In here, he the money man.

23:52.621 --> 23:53.974
What that mean though, I'm saying-

23:54.016 --> 23:55.753
- Like I said.

23:55.795 --> 23:57.960
It's not just the inmates.

23:58.002 --> 24:00.313
That man money run all
through the compound.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.917
Somebody gotta replace that.

24:01.959 --> 24:05.037
Everybody in the compound
know you ain't kill him.

24:05.079 --> 24:07.066
But the COs feel like that
you sent the unauthorized hit

24:07.108 --> 24:10.701
and for that, they don't want you in here.

24:10.743 --> 24:13.000
I ain't worried about them, homie.

24:13.042 --> 24:14.574
Sorry to bring that shit
to your cell though.

24:14.616 --> 24:16.381
Nah, nah, don't worry about me.

24:16.423 --> 24:17.476
They know how I get down.

24:17.518 --> 24:18.941
I'm solid.

24:18.983 --> 24:19.936
You really gotta watch out

24:19.978 --> 24:24.116
for these young motherfuckers
trying to pull rank though.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.259
See, you new here.

24:26.301 --> 24:28.756
So I'ma show you all the pockets

24:28.798 --> 24:32.099
so you can get home to your son, nigga.

24:32.141 --> 24:35.058
After that, ain't nothing I can do.

24:37.924 --> 24:40.174
Yeah, I respect it, yeah.

24:44.158 --> 24:48.317
So you the one that
turned my sister out, huh?

24:48.359 --> 24:50.537
Nah, I'm just playing, Zina, right?

24:50.579 --> 24:52.781
Yep, Zina Holloway.

24:52.823 --> 24:54.499
You must be doing something right.

24:54.541 --> 24:57.421
'Cause she happy and that's
all I give a fuck about.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.472
I am.

24:58.514 --> 24:59.956
But we should take you to a hospital.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.789
Fuck, no.

25:00.831 --> 25:02.873
This nigga killed Faze last night.

25:02.915 --> 25:04.157
You talking about Faze?

25:04.199 --> 25:05.640
The nigga that owned Fully Loaded?

25:05.682 --> 25:07.614
Yeah, yeah, a beef
with some ho ass nigga

25:07.656 --> 25:09.376
that entered the compound this week.

25:09.418 --> 25:11.440
Some bitch ass nigga named Rilla.

25:11.482 --> 25:13.160
Ooh, bullshit.

25:13.202 --> 25:15.412
You know this nigga?

25:15.454 --> 25:17.923
Yeah, Faze, he killed
his brother years ago.

25:17.965 --> 25:19.746
Plus that's my baby daddy.

25:19.788 --> 25:22.157
But when I see him, he's on sight.

25:22.199 --> 25:23.336
So this nigga owe you child support

25:23.378 --> 25:25.248
or something?

25:25.290 --> 25:27.290
Nah, total opposite.

25:27.332 --> 25:29.613
He made me lose my child.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.621
I pulled like 20 bodies for him.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.453
I did all his dirty work.

25:33.495 --> 25:36.696
Soon as I had to go away,
he turned his back on me.

25:36.738 --> 25:39.176
I ain't seen my son in five years.

25:39.218 --> 25:41.755
I don't have no idea how to find him.

25:41.797 --> 25:43.613
Well what about his girl?

25:43.655 --> 25:45.209
Didn't you say she had him?

25:45.251 --> 25:49.157
I mean we gonna run into that
goofy bitch sooner or later.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.699
What's her name?

25:51.595 --> 25:53.512
Ladonna or some shit.

25:57.935 --> 25:59.423
Yo, that's it right there!

25:59.465 --> 26:00.256
Turn around!

26:00.298 --> 26:01.089
For what?

26:01.131 --> 26:05.048
This the shit we looking
for, turn it around.

26:08.548 --> 26:11.523
Where the fuck is the phone log?

26:11.565 --> 26:13.051
Where the fuck is the log at?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.991
Your husband called from prison yesterday.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.366
I need that log.

26:20.292 --> 26:21.125
Shut up.

26:28.617 --> 26:30.617
Got that bitch.

26:31.481 --> 26:33.738
And you better not say shit

26:33.780 --> 26:35.613
'cause I will be back.

26:37.945 --> 26:38.945
Ass bitch.

26:40.293 --> 26:41.460
Find it, baby.

26:48.821 --> 26:49.778
What you gonna do?

26:49.820 --> 26:51.148
We need to kill that bitch.

26:51.190 --> 26:53.199
Faze was like my motherfucking brother.

26:53.241 --> 26:55.324
I wanna make this motherfucker feel it.

26:55.366 --> 26:56.783
Find the address.

27:57.546 --> 27:58.987
Hold, not right now, not right now,

27:59.029 --> 28:00.362
my son in there.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.215
I'm
trying to stay out the way

28:44.257 --> 28:46.753
so I can get outta here.

28:46.795 --> 28:50.673
But I almost lost that chance yesterday.

28:50.715 --> 28:54.775
I ain't seen my girl Ladonna
and my son in five years.

28:54.817 --> 28:55.772
She's been taking care of him

28:55.814 --> 28:58.033
since I've been in prison.

28:58.075 --> 28:59.325
She a real one.

29:07.792 --> 29:10.209
What happened to your hand?

29:11.357 --> 29:14.069
Is that why the phone cut off?

29:14.111 --> 29:15.513
Don't tell me you've been in here fighting

29:15.555 --> 29:17.638
and you about to get out.

29:20.809 --> 29:23.349
When is this gonna end?

29:23.391 --> 29:25.934
I mean when are you gonna grow up?

29:25.976 --> 29:28.299
I ain't trying to hear
that shit right now.

29:28.341 --> 29:31.491
You know what, it's all about you.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.673
Everything is about you.

29:33.715 --> 29:37.716
You don't give a fuck
about nobody but you!

29:37.758 --> 29:39.967
I know I put you through a lot.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.574
But I love you and my son.

29:42.616 --> 29:44.366
Yeah, I doubt that.

29:46.442 --> 29:50.355
You don't think I wanted
to have your child?

29:50.397 --> 29:51.653
But I would not want to have a child

29:51.695 --> 29:55.028
who's not gonna have a father, a family!

29:58.115 --> 30:01.577
I thought we were gonna get married.

30:01.619 --> 30:03.068
But your past came back with you

30:03.110 --> 30:06.233
and it sure as hell came back with me.

30:06.275 --> 30:09.854
I give your son the love that he needs.

30:09.896 --> 30:13.063
Love that you ain't never give nobody.

30:14.015 --> 30:16.793
What you came down here to beat me up?

30:16.835 --> 30:19.497
Huh, that's what you came down here to do?

30:19.539 --> 30:21.232
I told you when I get out of here,

30:21.274 --> 30:22.995
I'ma take care of my family.

30:23.037 --> 30:25.155
That's what I'm talking about.

30:25.197 --> 30:26.313
If you cared about your son,

30:26.355 --> 30:28.595
you would never have him
around drugs and shit!

30:28.637 --> 30:30.195
I love my son.

30:30.237 --> 30:32.773
I wouldn't put him in
a situation like that.

30:32.815 --> 30:34.595
This is legit business.

30:34.637 --> 30:36.297
I don't know how you
expect me to believe

30:36.339 --> 30:38.006
either one of those.

30:39.074 --> 30:40.814
You don't even know.

30:40.856 --> 30:43.356
Rita Robinson want to sign me.

30:44.738 --> 30:47.315
I mean I didn't know better.

30:47.357 --> 30:49.440
But I guess it's a start.

30:52.237 --> 30:55.530
You wanna bring Kevin
to see me next week?

30:55.572 --> 30:58.617
Yeah, he wanna be here when you get out.

30:58.659 --> 30:59.971
He has a surprise for you.

31:00.013 --> 31:01.351

That ain't gonna bring
my brother back, is it?

32:01.070 --> 32:02.203
No.

32:02.245 --> 32:03.703
All that money I'm
circulating up in there

32:03.745 --> 32:04.602
and he still get killed?

32:04.644 --> 32:05.967
Unauthorized.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.380
That nigga jumped the light.

32:08.422 --> 32:11.668
Trust me, he probably
won't be making it out.

32:11.710 --> 32:12.983
You sure it was Rilla?

32:13.025 --> 32:14.468
I'm positive.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.674
I told you I was tussling
with the big ass nigga.

32:16.716 --> 32:17.549
Yeah.

32:18.526 --> 32:20.227
Streets know.

32:20.269 --> 32:21.418
And they love Rilla's ass

32:21.460 --> 32:24.101
so that shit ain't gonna be easy.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.988
And this is your time now.

32:26.030 --> 32:29.863
So don't go fucking it
up like my brother did!

32:33.644 --> 32:34.477
I'm out.

32:39.173 --> 32:40.708
Yo.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.667
Turn this shit back up.

32:44.409 --> 32:46.484
What's up, man?

32:46.526 --> 32:47.545
What's happening?

32:47.587 --> 32:48.420
Hey.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.327
What's good, boy?

32:51.369 --> 32:52.927
What's happening, brother?

32:52.969 --> 32:54.145
You good?

32:54.187 --> 32:55.695
All right, come on.

32:55.737 --> 32:58.509
Let's get in there, man.

32:58.551 --> 32:59.384
Ah!

33:00.656 --> 33:03.239
What's good, you know who I am?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.057
My daddy?

33:09.099 --> 33:10.753
Yeah, that's right.

33:10.795 --> 33:12.977
Your daddy home now.

33:13.019 --> 33:14.897
What's up, what you
doing right there, man?

33:14.939 --> 33:16.318
You a little rapper?

33:16.360 --> 33:19.734
That's the only music he listens to.

33:19.776 --> 33:22.040
Let me hear something.

33:22.082 --> 33:22.983
Oh, go ahead Kevin.

33:23.025 --> 33:25.654
Let your father hear what you got.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.279
Oh, come on, Kevin.

33:28.914 --> 33:30.254
My name is Kevin

33:30.296 --> 33:31.537
and if you mess with me

33:31.579 --> 33:32.892
I'm going to beat you up.

33:32.934 --> 33:33.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:33.936 --> 33:35.499
You can't run around beating people up.

33:35.541 --> 33:36.817
Where you get that from?

33:36.859 --> 33:37.650
You.

33:37.692 --> 33:39.697
Yeah, he found your music on his iPad

33:39.739 --> 33:42.059
and then he sneaks and listens to it.

33:42.101 --> 33:43.217
Aigh't, well look,

33:43.259 --> 33:44.721
we're not gonna listen to me no more

33:44.763 --> 33:45.976
or anybody else.

33:46.018 --> 33:48.699
You understand, that's bad, you dig?

33:48.741 --> 33:50.459
No more of that.

33:50.501 --> 33:51.292
Yeah?

33:51.334 --> 33:52.801
Straight soccer.

33:52.843 --> 33:53.895
We cool with that?

33:53.937 --> 33:54.728
Yes.

33:54.770 --> 33:57.499
Okay, what type of position you play?

33:57.541 --> 33:58.561
Striker.

33:58.603 --> 33:59.798
Striker?

33:59.840 --> 34:01.899
What does a striker do?

34:01.941 --> 34:04.118
I just kick the ball real hard.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.533
But I keep slipping and falling

34:05.575 --> 34:08.983
because my shoes are old and not good.

34:09.025 --> 34:12.108
Oh, no wonder why you keep falling.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.998
Uh-uh, we gonna have to fix that.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.838
The next game, I'ma have some new shoes.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.518
We gonna fix that, right?

34:18.560 --> 34:19.899
Yeah, but it's today.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.036
That was his surprise.

34:21.079 --> 34:22.973
I was gonna tell you
when we got in the house.

34:23.014 --> 34:25.498
Oh, man, that's wonderful.

34:25.541 --> 34:28.697
First day home and I get
to watch my son kick butt?

34:28.739 --> 34:29.989
Yeah, let's go!

34:39.934 --> 34:41.016
Mr. Denver?

34:41.953 --> 34:42.914
She's here.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.206
Great, great.

34:46.455 --> 34:47.290
Have a seat.

34:47.331 --> 34:48.326
Thank you.

34:48.368 --> 34:49.868
Thanks, Valerie.

34:51.116 --> 34:54.674
So, Cortney mentioned you wanted
to speak with me personally

34:54.716 --> 34:56.708
so I immediately cleared my schedule.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.303
Yes, thank you so much
for taking the time.

34:59.345 --> 35:01.074
My pleasure.

35:01.116 --> 35:02.956
As you know, things can
get pretty busy around here

35:02.998 --> 35:04.740
whenever we start a new season.

35:04.782 --> 35:06.455
Yes, the industry is in an uproar

35:06.497 --> 35:10.112
waiting for the winner
of Turnt every season.

35:10.154 --> 35:11.255
So let me ask you this,

35:11.297 --> 35:13.396
how many seasons has it been on air?

35:13.438 --> 35:15.874
My wife and I founded it back in 96.

35:15.916 --> 35:17.833
Wow, congratulations.

35:19.053 --> 35:20.677
Thanks.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.107
You know, we had to make a few adjustments

35:22.149 --> 35:23.487
because of the pandemic.

35:23.529 --> 35:24.916
But we're still going strong.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.367
And I tell you what,

35:26.409 --> 35:29.214
the streaming and
virtual events, now king.

35:29.256 --> 35:30.230
Yes.

35:30.272 --> 35:32.451
The internet is where it's at.

35:32.493 --> 35:34.574
That's actually the reason
why I wanted to take

35:34.616 --> 35:36.051
a meeting with you.

35:36.093 --> 35:40.207
Do you remember Labarius
Stanford, AKA Rilla?

35:40.249 --> 35:41.710
I sure do.

35:41.752 --> 35:42.712
How could I forget?

35:42.754 --> 35:44.174
He was shot on our
property a few years back.

35:48.819 --> 35:50.644
Please don't tell me you're here

35:50.686 --> 35:52.414
to discuss that young man.

35:52.456 --> 35:54.090
Actually, I am.

35:54.132 --> 35:56.291
Artists like him make your show.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.830
Your audience tunes in
to see people like him

35:58.872 --> 36:00.712
because that's who they can relate to.

36:00.754 --> 36:02.447
That's true.

36:02.489 --> 36:05.150
But you do know our
ratings hit an all time low

36:05.192 --> 36:07.390
after that event took place.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.690
And you know, the fact he
went to prison right after

36:09.732 --> 36:12.170
caused us to lose sponsors left and right.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.748
Truthfully, it hurts the other contestants

36:13.790 --> 36:15.633
more than it hurts the show.

36:15.675 --> 36:17.908
Well I can't argue with you on that.

36:17.950 --> 36:20.452
I mean this show has been
a backbone for many artists

36:20.494 --> 36:22.271
since I started my record label.

36:22.313 --> 36:26.528
In fact, my most successful
artist started on Turnt.

36:26.570 --> 36:27.783
I guess what I'm trying to say

36:27.825 --> 36:30.868
is that the hip-hop
genre has a lot of fans

36:30.910 --> 36:34.494
and I think that you should
think about bringing it back.

36:34.536 --> 36:37.329
I can't promise you that.

36:37.371 --> 36:39.908
But I can promise I'll think about it.

36:39.950 --> 36:41.348
I have a question.

36:41.390 --> 36:42.181
Shoot.

36:42.223 --> 36:44.369
Why is this so important to you?

36:44.411 --> 36:48.532
We all know Rita Robinson
only signs female artists.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.828
Is this a chess move,

36:49.870 --> 36:52.751
you're looking to sign
your first male artist?

36:52.793 --> 36:53.988
You can't ask me to take a risk

36:54.030 --> 36:55.947
if you're not ready to.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.431
Mr. Denver, do you
know why my record label

37:03.473 --> 37:04.890
is so successful?

37:06.049 --> 37:06.884
No.

37:06.926 --> 37:09.124
Because all my risks will be lower

37:09.166 --> 37:11.009
than my counterparts.

37:11.051 --> 37:13.287
Because you leave everyone
else to take the risks?

37:13.329 --> 37:16.996
No, because I take
them when others don't.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.657
You have a nice day, Mr. Denver.

37:29.126 --> 37:30.224
Your daddy's still here?

37:30.266 --> 37:31.724
No, he at the airport.

37:31.766 --> 37:35.025
Oh man, I thought
he'd be retired by now.

37:35.067 --> 37:36.405
Shoot, he still hate me?

37:36.447 --> 37:37.905
No, this his last year at Delta.

37:37.947 --> 37:40.364
And yeah, he still hates you.

37:44.289 --> 37:46.844
Are you going to sleep
in mommy's room too?

37:46.886 --> 37:48.340
Son, what you mean?

37:48.382 --> 37:51.527
You six years old, you still
sleeping with your mama?

37:51.569 --> 37:54.305
No, my uncle sleeps in there sometimes

37:54.347 --> 37:57.178
but I have my Spiderman
bed in my own room.

37:57.220 --> 38:00.072
Mmm, you just
get ready for the game.

38:00.114 --> 38:00.905
Okay.

38:00.947 --> 38:01.947
All right.

38:06.093 --> 38:07.310
It's not like that.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.352
Jan, look.

38:09.414 --> 38:11.376
I need to hold the keys to your car.

38:11.418 --> 38:13.007
Aren't you gonna make it to his game?

38:13.049 --> 38:14.135
Of course.

38:14.177 --> 38:15.532
I got something to do.

38:15.574 --> 38:18.071
What you need to do
just went in the house.

38:18.113 --> 38:20.935
No, what I gotta do is
take care of my damn son.

38:20.977 --> 38:21.810
So let me.

38:23.591 --> 38:24.833
It ain't no gas in there

38:24.875 --> 38:25.932
and I ain't got no money.

38:44.673 --> 38:47.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm chilling, man.

38:47.174 --> 38:49.534
I'm proud of you, dog.

38:49.576 --> 38:52.100
This where the sidewalks get you huh?

38:52.142 --> 38:53.269
Sidewalks?

38:53.311 --> 38:54.273
What you talking about, man?

38:54.315 --> 38:56.869
Yeah, staying on the
sidewalks off the street.

38:56.911 --> 38:59.991
Yeah.

39:00.033 --> 39:00.946
You know what though,

39:00.988 --> 39:03.310
it was actually your sister
that kept me off the street.

39:03.352 --> 39:04.892
Now she family oriented,

39:04.934 --> 39:07.230
she a piece of you, your
brother, your mother.

39:07.272 --> 39:09.633
When all that shit fell apart,

39:09.675 --> 39:11.911
hate to say it but she
don't want this no more.

39:11.953 --> 39:13.896
You know, I tried to
stick around but it was,

39:13.938 --> 39:15.624
I can dig it, bro.

39:15.666 --> 39:17.649
I understand death.

39:17.691 --> 39:19.384
My mama died, she just lost it.

39:19.426 --> 39:22.172
She's the one that took it the worst.

39:22.214 --> 39:24.151
It was tough on here.

39:24.193 --> 39:25.649
But...

39:25.691 --> 39:28.071
Rita told me to give you this.

39:28.113 --> 39:29.947
She got a package for you.

39:29.989 --> 39:32.268
Your CD, My Brother's Keeper

39:32.310 --> 39:34.988
has been streaming for five years nonstop.

39:35.030 --> 39:36.584
So there's a check in there.

39:36.626 --> 39:38.094
Streaming, what's that?

39:38.136 --> 39:40.012
Well, it's like buying a record

39:40.054 --> 39:42.049
but you just listen to it on your phone.

39:42.091 --> 39:43.064
Check it out.

39:43.106 --> 39:44.606
Yeah, let's see.

39:45.670 --> 39:46.503
Oh, man.

39:48.256 --> 39:49.839
- Right.
- Rita, mm.

39:50.741 --> 39:52.344
She really fucking with you, bro.

39:52.386 --> 39:54.135
Yeah I see.

39:54.177 --> 39:56.170
I appreciate you though, bro.

39:56.212 --> 39:58.775
Real talk, holding it down for me.

39:58.817 --> 40:01.923
I don't trust a lot of
people with Ladonna,

40:01.965 --> 40:04.403
to take care of my family.

40:04.445 --> 40:05.778
But I trust you.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.544
Like I said, there's a lot of people,

40:09.586 --> 40:12.685
back then, that was
really rocking with you.

40:12.727 --> 40:14.477
But today, it's Rita.

40:15.425 --> 40:17.241
Like she really fucking with you, dog.

40:17.283 --> 40:19.168
She put all this shit together.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.719
I'm about to go see her right now.

40:20.761 --> 40:21.552
You do that.

40:21.594 --> 40:22.525
- All right, bro.
- All right.

40:22.567 --> 40:23.358
You be easy.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.567
All right, holla at you.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.602
I spent my whole life

40:32.644 --> 40:34.479
jeopardizing my freedom,

40:34.521 --> 40:37.644
putting myself and family in harm's way.

40:39.506 --> 40:42.423
My brother lost his life behind me.

40:50.899 --> 40:52.180
After he died, I promised

40:52.222 --> 40:54.819
that I was gonna keep his dream alive.

40:54.861 --> 40:56.445
Which I did.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.404
But I wasn't no rapper.

41:00.177 --> 41:02.427
All I knew was the streets.

41:03.299 --> 41:05.144
So I wasn't gonna rest till I got revenge.

41:08.417 --> 41:11.584
I surrounded myself with real killers.

41:12.621 --> 41:15.480
This is blood here, this physical form.

41:15.522 --> 41:17.082
Put that shit up.

41:17.124 --> 41:21.876
I was
blinded by fake loyalty.

41:21.918 --> 41:23.139
I knew the game.

41:24.183 --> 41:26.516
You die by what you live by.

41:31.970 --> 41:34.861
But you know what the
hardest thing for me was?

41:34.903 --> 41:36.697
She raised me way better than this.

41:36.739 --> 41:38.826
Now you call that motherfucker,

41:38.868 --> 41:41.396
and tell him his days are numbered.

41:41.438 --> 41:45.250
You fuck with my family,
I fuck with yours!

41:45.292 --> 41:47.897
And
she deserved more from me.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.106
But I'm gonna make it right this time.

42:05.347 --> 42:06.180
Mama.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.819
I felt like I let you down.

42:15.882 --> 42:18.715
I ain't do what you told me to do.

42:20.017 --> 42:22.017
I blame myself for that.

42:24.464 --> 42:25.415
I was supposed to help Kenny

42:25.457 --> 42:27.624
the way I was supposed to.

42:29.836 --> 42:31.753
But I'm gonna fix that.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.388
'Cause I love you

42:38.316 --> 42:39.733
and I love Kenny.

42:54.685 --> 42:57.935
I'ma bring it home for Kenny this time.

43:00.609 --> 43:03.359

Thank you.

That's why you do it big.

46:37.432 --> 46:39.568

46:39.610 --> 46:40.692
Rita Robinson.

46:40.734 --> 46:42.203
- Yeah.
- You know it!

46:42.245 --> 46:45.167
All right, so what's going on?

46:45.209 --> 46:48.847
Well, this is Frank
Lester, our attorney.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.071
Nice to meet you, brother.

46:50.113 --> 46:53.926
And this here is Thriller,
our super producer.

46:53.968 --> 46:54.824
How you doing?

46:54.866 --> 46:55.852
I got some heat for you.

46:55.894 --> 46:57.909
Oh yeah, I heard it
when I was coming in.

46:57.951 --> 46:59.062
You wanna get on this one?

46:59.104 --> 47:00.104
- Yeah, that sound right.
- Yeah.

47:00.146 --> 47:02.262
She's dope as fuck.

Okay then.

47:04.156 --> 47:05.101
Here, let me play it,

47:05.143 --> 47:06.656

47:12.643 --> 47:14.560
You can rock with this?

47:16.675 --> 47:18.658
Oh, excuse me, I gotta take this.

47:18.700 --> 47:20.697
This is my son.

47:20.739 --> 47:22.776
Mm-mm, don't even worry about it.

47:22.818 --> 47:24.402
He's not yours, okay?

47:24.444 --> 47:27.138
So now you see why I had
to go get him, right?

47:27.180 --> 47:30.597
I see why you got your man out of jail.

47:31.484 --> 47:32.721
Get away from
him, get away from him.

47:32.763 --> 47:34.500
That's it, you got it, Kevin.

47:34.542 --> 47:35.505
Kick it!

47:35.547 --> 47:36.703
Go, go, go, kick it!

47:42.885 --> 47:44.886
- Good job Kevin, good job!
- Good job!

47:44.928 --> 47:46.578
Is he the best on his team?

47:46.620 --> 47:48.545
He might be, that's his first goal.

47:48.587 --> 47:49.701
Oh yeah?

47:49.743 --> 47:51.926
His first one, hasn't scored one yet.

47:51.968 --> 47:53.723
I guess it's 'cause you here.

47:53.765 --> 47:54.598
Oh, no.

47:55.432 --> 47:56.763
Look.

47:56.805 --> 48:00.145
I know I pushed through a
lot of things but I got you.

48:00.187 --> 48:02.342
I'll get you a new
house, new car, all that.

48:02.384 --> 48:05.790
We can get back to where we was at.

48:05.832 --> 48:06.665
Look.

48:09.104 --> 48:12.305
I just want you to focus
on Kevin right now,

48:12.347 --> 48:15.042
try and get my career back.

48:15.084 --> 48:18.582
What, you seeing
somebody else or something?

48:20.284 --> 48:24.145
You got things going on in your life?

48:24.187 --> 48:25.770
That's real though.

48:26.784 --> 48:29.820
I respect it.

48:49.299 --> 48:50.132
Daddy!

48:52.892 --> 48:53.932
I scored!

48:53.974 --> 48:55.050
Did you see me?

48:55.092 --> 48:57.448
Yeah, we seen you, you did wonderful.

48:57.490 --> 48:58.690
Hey man, nice meeting you.

48:58.732 --> 49:00.047
I just wanted to come by and tell you

49:00.089 --> 49:01.932
thank you for the donation to the team.

49:01.974 --> 49:03.417
Parents really appreciate it.

49:03.459 --> 49:04.325
Yeah, that's what's up.

49:04.367 --> 49:05.441
You'll see a lot more of me.

49:05.483 --> 49:06.606
Man, we look forward to it.

49:06.648 --> 49:08.492
- Good job, Kevin.
- Good job, man.

49:08.534 --> 49:11.410
Hey man, I see that win, dog.

49:11.452 --> 49:13.967
You rocked that joint huh?

49:14.009 --> 49:14.842
Good job.

49:39.719 --> 49:40.680
How'd he do?

49:40.722 --> 49:42.077
He scored a goal.

49:42.119 --> 49:42.952
Wow.

49:44.039 --> 49:44.872
Amazing.

49:46.519 --> 49:50.186
Maybe because his father
decided to show up.

49:51.424 --> 49:52.797
Amazing what kids can accomplish

49:52.839 --> 49:54.241
when their father's in their life.

49:54.283 --> 49:55.724
Daddy, please.

49:55.766 --> 49:56.742
Look, here, baby.

49:56.784 --> 49:58.204
Go in the house and get
ready for dinner, okay?

49:58.246 --> 49:59.913
Take that, will you?

50:06.143 --> 50:08.620
He don't know what a
real father supposed to do.

50:08.662 --> 50:10.185
Real father stays in the child life

50:10.227 --> 50:12.122
until their last day on earth,

50:12.164 --> 50:14.077
no matter how old they get.

50:14.119 --> 50:16.422
See, I'm a real father.

50:16.464 --> 50:20.102
I had your child in my
home for five years.

50:20.144 --> 50:22.638
And you stand here with
all this fancy shit on

50:22.680 --> 50:24.627
like you're supposed to be somebody,

50:24.669 --> 50:26.752
but you ain't shit to me.

50:28.404 --> 50:31.462
It takes a real man to be a real father.

50:31.504 --> 50:35.461
All you wanna do is just be a real nigger.

50:35.503 --> 50:37.177
Imagine somebody did this to your child.

50:37.219 --> 50:39.762
Daddy, please, just...

50:39.804 --> 50:40.887
Dad, just go.

50:46.665 --> 50:49.753
Look, I am so sorry about that.

50:49.795 --> 50:51.212
Nah, it's cool.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.077
He right.

50:54.119 --> 50:56.679
Sat down for five years
and thought about that.

50:56.721 --> 50:58.295
But I ran into Cortney.

50:58.337 --> 50:59.670
Wait, Cortney?

51:00.653 --> 51:02.578
Like you seen Cortney?

51:02.620 --> 51:04.170
Yeah.

51:04.212 --> 51:05.415
What'd he say?

51:05.457 --> 51:07.411
Is everything good with y'all?

51:07.453 --> 51:09.310
Yeah, everything's wonderful.

51:09.352 --> 51:10.317
He's 100.

51:10.359 --> 51:12.494
He did what he say he was gonna do.

51:12.536 --> 51:15.819
So we can get up out of here ASAP.

51:15.861 --> 51:16.694
Wait.

51:18.006 --> 51:18.839
Labarius.

51:19.902 --> 51:23.069
I told you, I don't want that no more.

51:25.237 --> 51:27.070
I've given you enough.

51:30.718 --> 51:31.551
Right.

51:35.561 --> 51:36.394
Kevin.

51:40.820 --> 51:42.420
Yes, Daddy?

51:42.462 --> 51:44.631
Wait, who is that?

51:44.673 --> 51:46.006
Rita Robinson.

51:47.617 --> 51:51.390
You know what, why don't
you take your son with you?

51:51.432 --> 51:52.265
Listen.

51:53.250 --> 51:55.670
Daddy will be back, couple of days.

51:55.712 --> 51:57.511
Gonna get the house you wanted, right?

51:57.553 --> 51:59.555
With a big swing set
and a swimming pool?

51:59.597 --> 52:01.034
Yeah.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.131
Let me see your phone.

52:02.173 --> 52:04.206
For what, you ain't
got no business in there.

52:04.248 --> 52:06.248
Let me see your phone.

52:08.392 --> 52:09.225
Now look.

52:11.069 --> 52:13.850
You call me anytime you need me,

52:13.892 --> 52:14.683
you see that?

52:14.725 --> 52:16.045
This is your special ringtone.

52:16.087 --> 52:17.334
There's Daddy.

52:17.376 --> 52:20.959
So use this so Daddy
know that you calling.

52:30.553 --> 52:32.202
I'ma make a store run real quick.

52:32.244 --> 52:33.334
A'ight well don't be too long

52:33.376 --> 52:34.387
'cause we gotta get outta here.

52:34.429 --> 52:35.846
A'ight.

52:39.238 --> 52:41.405
So you must be the boss.

52:45.382 --> 52:47.020
Excuse me?

52:47.062 --> 52:49.002
I'm Rita Robinson, and you are?

52:49.044 --> 52:51.322
I'm Mr. Henry, Ladonna's father.

52:51.364 --> 52:52.807
I know who you are.

52:52.849 --> 52:55.900
The only female music
producer in the business.

52:55.942 --> 52:57.356
I have a question.

52:57.398 --> 53:00.640
Why would a woman, a black woman

53:00.682 --> 53:03.309
who so-called cares about her people

53:03.351 --> 53:06.480
affiliate herself with a
man that don't give a fuck

53:06.522 --> 53:07.865
about his son,

53:07.907 --> 53:10.019
let alone a black man?

53:10.061 --> 53:11.946
I would think that
given the current state

53:11.988 --> 53:13.375
of the black man in America

53:13.417 --> 53:16.544
that you would identify with Rilla.

53:16.586 --> 53:17.836
Ha ha, I see.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.260
You in love with him.

53:21.302 --> 53:22.469
Just remember.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.282
The heart fools the mind.

53:26.324 --> 53:28.715
They say
your past will creep up on you

53:28.757 --> 53:30.840
when you least expect it.

53:32.276 --> 53:36.244
There was a reason why Zina
Holloway was on my team.

53:36.286 --> 53:37.779
She's a killer.

53:37.821 --> 53:40.720
But her soft spot is kids.

53:40.762 --> 53:41.595
Fuck!

53:43.652 --> 53:45.014
Then
out the blue I see Russ.

53:45.056 --> 53:45.997
- Homeboy.
- What's up, homie?

53:46.039 --> 53:47.039
When the hell you get out?

53:47.081 --> 53:47.872
What's going on with you, man?

53:47.914 --> 53:49.349
Your girl with you?

53:49.391 --> 53:51.237
Man, ain't shit,
boy, how you been, man?

53:51.279 --> 53:52.379
I'm chilling,
man, I thought you got out

53:52.421 --> 53:53.432
at the same time.

53:53.474 --> 53:54.917
Man, hell no, bro.

53:54.959 --> 53:56.599
No I had like a month left.

53:56.641 --> 53:58.631
Them folk fuck around and came to my cell

53:58.673 --> 53:59.717
and got me up out of there.

53:59.759 --> 54:01.114
Ain't no shit, you know ask no question.

54:01.156 --> 54:02.415
- You feel me?
- That's crazy.

54:02.457 --> 54:03.957
What you got going on now though?

54:03.999 --> 54:05.180
Shit I'm trying to get in the studio.

54:05.222 --> 54:06.013
Trying to get like you.

54:06.055 --> 54:07.384
Oh, for sure, for sure.

54:07.426 --> 54:09.187
I'm gonna go to Starlight tonight.

54:09.229 --> 54:10.326
You wanna hop in with me?

54:10.368 --> 54:11.159
Starlight?

54:11.201 --> 54:11.992
Yeah.

54:12.034 --> 54:13.447
Hell yeah, shit, let me
just drop my little ho,

54:13.489 --> 54:15.560
whip out, and shit, I'll pull up with you.

54:15.602 --> 54:16.732
All right,
cool, we'll follow you.

54:16.774 --> 54:17.690
- All right.
- All right.

54:17.732 --> 54:20.482
- Yeah, yeah.
- Give me a minute.

54:24.049 --> 54:25.648
Yo, where your sister at?

54:25.690 --> 54:26.521
She's somewhere around here.

54:26.563 --> 54:27.663
What the fuck is wrong with you?

54:27.705 --> 54:28.809
Man, I almost had this nigga!

54:28.851 --> 54:31.241
Really, what you mean you almost had?

54:31.283 --> 54:32.495
He had another nigga with him.

54:32.537 --> 54:33.375
And?

54:33.417 --> 54:34.633
There was kids out there!

54:34.675 --> 54:37.582
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

54:37.624 --> 54:39.506
I don't give a fuck when kids are around

54:39.548 --> 54:41.464
or who they belong to.

54:41.506 --> 54:45.026
If they in the way, then
they just in the way.

54:45.068 --> 54:47.283
And I thought you was a killer.

54:47.325 --> 54:48.219
Listen here.

54:48.261 --> 54:50.424
All that subliminal shit you talking

54:50.466 --> 54:52.946
is gonna get you killed
right here in this studio.

54:52.988 --> 54:54.905
Reference my son again.

54:57.569 --> 54:59.403
Z, what the fuck is you doing?

54:59.445 --> 55:02.604
Damn, sis, you got a bad bitch.

55:02.646 --> 55:03.646
I like that.

55:04.769 --> 55:05.769

56:05.696 --> 56:07.029
How you doing?

56:08.907 --> 56:11.150
Wait, everything straight?

56:11.192 --> 56:14.169
What, I can't just come and see you?

56:14.211 --> 56:15.044
Yeah.

56:16.656 --> 56:18.489
Course you could come see me.

56:18.531 --> 56:19.370
But you're not gonna sit here and act

56:19.412 --> 56:21.662
like Rilla ain't come home.

56:22.528 --> 56:24.671
We can't act like it's cool.

56:24.713 --> 56:27.546
It's not, it's actually fucked up.

56:30.950 --> 56:33.871
You know he came to see me today.

56:33.913 --> 56:36.949
I looked this man in his
eyes after five years

56:36.991 --> 56:38.385
and guilt hit me.

56:38.427 --> 56:41.711
All right, well you
think I don't feel bad?

56:41.753 --> 56:43.584
When do we get to live our lives?

56:43.626 --> 56:45.290
When can it be about us?

56:45.332 --> 56:46.915
Rilla's living his.

56:48.393 --> 56:51.230
Look, I just can't turn this off.

56:51.272 --> 56:52.939
I love you, Cortney.

56:54.153 --> 56:55.596
You love me?

56:55.638 --> 56:56.471
Yeah.

56:57.568 --> 56:58.485
You sure?

57:00.969 --> 57:02.052
I can't tell.

57:03.071 --> 57:04.738
Maybe here too much.

57:05.685 --> 57:07.803
All right, I love you too.

57:07.845 --> 57:09.262
Just making sure.

57:10.212 --> 57:12.043
But I know Rilla.

57:12.085 --> 57:13.563
At this time, Ad,

57:13.605 --> 57:14.396
things is what they is,

57:14.438 --> 57:16.813
I think we need to leave this alone.

57:16.855 --> 57:18.401
We have to.

57:18.443 --> 57:22.526
Well, I think that it's
a little late for that.

57:35.563 --> 57:36.480
Oh, shit.

57:37.803 --> 57:38.636
Well.

57:40.119 --> 57:42.370
Guess we're gonna have to figure it out.

57:42.412 --> 57:43.498
- Okay.
- You wanna figure it out?

57:43.540 --> 57:44.373
Yeah.

57:45.229 --> 57:46.062
Okay.

58:05.603 --> 58:06.435
What up though?

58:06.477 --> 58:08.047
How are you today, my brother?

58:08.089 --> 58:09.463
I'm doing good.

58:09.505 --> 58:11.539
You must have made your mind up.

58:11.581 --> 58:12.706
Well, yes.

58:12.748 --> 58:14.207
Rita obviously knows her shit

58:14.249 --> 58:16.445
so I'm inclined to agree, but,

58:16.487 --> 58:19.485
my only quirk is that
this is a family show.

58:19.527 --> 58:20.903
And if any bullshit breaks out

58:20.945 --> 58:23.346
I will have no choice
but to permanently ban

58:23.388 --> 58:25.139
artists like this from my show

58:25.181 --> 58:27.762
and I will hold you fully responsible.

58:27.804 --> 58:29.678
Do you understand?

58:29.720 --> 58:32.226
Oh yeah, I understand.

58:32.268 --> 58:34.263
- You know-
- Cortney.

58:34.305 --> 58:35.939
Are you sure you want
to put your whole career

58:35.981 --> 58:37.866
on the line for this guy?

58:37.908 --> 58:41.965
People like this will always
screw good people over.

58:42.007 --> 58:43.085
Yeah, that's true but,

58:43.127 --> 58:44.730
you know sometimes good people

58:44.772 --> 58:47.022
will screw people over too.

58:48.043 --> 58:49.543
Talk to you later.

59:00.813 --> 59:02.158
Just give me the tracks and the beat,

59:02.200 --> 59:03.434
you know what we gonna do, right?

59:03.476 --> 59:04.307
Come on, bro.

59:04.349 --> 59:05.282
- I got you.
- Absolutely.

59:05.324 --> 59:06.349
All right, well listen,

59:06.391 --> 59:08.750
we need at least one of them to be a hit.

59:08.792 --> 59:11.550
So I'm locking you and
Thriller in the studio

59:11.592 --> 59:13.237
all day tomorrow.

59:13.279 --> 59:14.510
And as soon as Cortney get here,

59:14.552 --> 59:16.229
we just gonna go over the rest.

59:16.271 --> 59:17.854
And here is your contract.

59:17.896 --> 59:20.129
You can have your lawyer
take a look at that.

59:20.171 --> 59:21.486
If you have any questions at all,

59:21.528 --> 59:23.027
do not hesitate to give me a call.

59:23.069 --> 59:24.574
My phone always on.

59:24.616 --> 59:27.783
You can get that back to me right now.

59:29.117 --> 59:30.950
Hey, what up though?

59:32.025 --> 59:34.334
You all right?

59:34.376 --> 59:35.726
Ah, yeah, I'm good.

59:35.768 --> 59:36.559
- I'm good.
- You know,

59:36.601 --> 59:39.448
you the only person I know
that say "What up though?"

59:39.490 --> 59:43.150
Yeah well, where I'm from
everybody say it, so...

59:43.192 --> 59:44.586
But look, I gotta quick out

59:44.628 --> 59:46.516
so I'ma get right to it.

59:46.558 --> 59:48.474
First thing is I had to pull some strings

59:48.516 --> 59:51.790
as y'all probably
imagine to get this done.

59:51.832 --> 59:55.684
So we gonna get y'all on the
next upcoming show, okay?

59:55.726 --> 59:58.190
Bro, the judges were reluctant to do this

59:58.232 --> 01:00:00.324
because they know I used to manage you.

01:00:00.366 --> 01:00:03.764
And they scared about violence, okay?

01:00:03.806 --> 01:00:05.491
But look, the good thing is

01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:07.870
if y'all pick the right song and kill it,

01:00:07.912 --> 01:00:09.028
the world is yours.

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:10.646
The world is ours.

01:00:10.688 --> 01:00:11.899
- Yes.
- Right?

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:12.732
Right.

01:00:12.774 --> 01:00:16.064
So we had Kenny here,
we had you here before.

01:00:16.106 --> 01:00:18.020
So the time is now.

01:00:18.062 --> 01:00:20.821
All right, and what's the bad news?

01:00:20.863 --> 01:00:24.282
Well, well, well, the bad news is,

01:00:24.324 --> 01:00:26.485
if something do happen,

01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:28.322
they gonna fire me

01:00:28.364 --> 01:00:30.245
and they gonna ban rap
music from the show.

01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:33.375
Point blank, no questions, over.

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.841
All right, well check this
out, that's not gonna happen.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.363
So you can dead that, we
ain't even thinking like that.

01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:39.446
- Dead.
- Right.

01:00:39.488 --> 01:00:40.279
Okay.

01:00:40.321 --> 01:00:41.895
So y'all give it up for my boy Rilla.

01:00:41.937 --> 01:00:43.167
Okay.

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:44.546
- All right.
- That's right.

01:00:44.588 --> 01:00:45.379
- All right.
- That's right.

01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:47.205
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:48.203
You ready?

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:50.429
Like a motherfucker.

01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.283

I mean us as black people

01:02:25.384 --> 01:02:27.191
we gotta fight 10 times harder

01:02:27.233 --> 01:02:30.635
dealing with this
institutional racist bullshit.

01:02:30.677 --> 01:02:33.355
And all we trying to do is
just create generational wealth

01:02:33.397 --> 01:02:36.379
for our kids, and they can
create it for their kids.

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.899
You're right.

01:02:37.941 --> 01:02:40.194

Thank you.

01:02:52.862 --> 01:02:56.629
I just hope that he gets it
before it's too late, you know?

01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:59.314
You should fly him out
here so I could talk to him,

01:02:59.356 --> 01:03:01.878
tell him about jail and the streets,

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.774
and just maybe he stays his little ass

01:03:03.816 --> 01:03:05.351
on the sidewalk like Cortney.

01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:07.467

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:57.948
About to do a Kesha on that nigga.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:59.407

01:04:01.052 --> 01:04:02.153
Kesha?

01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:04.584
You know, from New Jack City.

01:04:04.626 --> 01:04:07.464

01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:13.966
Nigga you can't go up

That ain't the move.

01:04:15.605 --> 01:04:16.622
You know I had to go in there

01:04:16.664 --> 01:04:20.100
and beg them people for my brother's body?

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:22.142
They said dead or alive,

01:04:23.528 --> 01:04:26.563
he's still property of the state.

01:04:26.605 --> 01:04:28.424
So basically I had to buy his body back

01:04:28.466 --> 01:04:30.126
just to give him a funeral.

01:04:30.168 --> 01:04:31.140

01:19:31.382 --> 01:19:34.060
You have reached the one

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.574
- and the only Star.
- No.

01:19:36.616 --> 01:19:37.449
No!

01:19:43.299 --> 01:19:44.971
What up, yas?

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:47.321
- You have reached the one
- Baby, pick up!

01:19:47.363 --> 01:19:50.172
and the only Star.

01:19:50.214 --> 01:19:52.870
If you just saw that fat ho,

01:19:52.912 --> 01:19:54.271
Fuck!

01:19:55.937 --> 01:19:58.187
I should have never left.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.581
Cortney!

01:20:52.439 --> 01:20:53.618
What's up, Zina?

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.661
What happened?

01:20:55.703 --> 01:20:57.517
Same shit always happened.

01:20:57.559 --> 01:20:58.898
Black men killing each other

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.773
and calling it a fucking rap beef.

01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:06.077
Rilla straight?

01:21:06.119 --> 01:21:06.952
He hit.

01:21:07.819 --> 01:21:11.580
Police looking for him
and that dude he be with.

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:13.253
Mmm, you know where he at?

01:21:13.295 --> 01:21:16.712
I'm just trying to make sure he straight.

01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:19.351
He probably with Rita.

01:21:19.393 --> 01:21:20.258
You know, she just bought a studio

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.317
down on Walker street.

01:21:23.192 --> 01:21:24.192
All right.

01:21:26.893 --> 01:21:27.684
Wait.

01:21:27.726 --> 01:21:30.009
Hey, Zina, wait, what you about to do?

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.550
Zina.

01:21:31.592 --> 01:21:32.425
Zina!

01:21:36.301 --> 01:21:37.134
Damn.

01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:01.439
Fredo!

01:22:16.685 --> 01:22:19.056
Call Rita Robinson.

01:22:19.098 --> 01:22:20.059
What the fuck?

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.377
I can't talk right now, Cortney,

01:22:21.419 --> 01:22:23.539
they just tried to kill us in a drive-by.

01:22:23.581 --> 01:22:26.016
Rita, that was Zina.

01:22:26.058 --> 01:22:27.280
Was it a black old school?

01:22:27.322 --> 01:22:28.496
Yeah.

01:22:28.538 --> 01:22:30.204
She was just up here looking for Rilla.

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:31.200
That was Zina.

01:22:31.242 --> 01:22:32.033
Are you okay?

01:22:32.075 --> 01:22:33.033
No, I'm straight.

01:22:33.075 --> 01:22:35.303
But listen, I'ma have to
hit you back, all right?

01:22:35.345 --> 01:22:36.698
All right.

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:37.573
Damn!

01:22:47.071 --> 01:22:49.468
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, hey!

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.628
- Hello?
- Rilla.

01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:51.461
What's up, babe?

01:22:51.503 --> 01:22:52.808
Yeah your baby mama
just came through here

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:54.223
and tried to kill us.

01:22:54.265 --> 01:22:55.098
Oh, man!

01:22:56.589 --> 01:22:58.040
Listen, babe.

01:22:58.082 --> 01:22:59.323
You're gonna have to fly back to Cali.

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:02.641
I'm about to act fucking crazy out here.

01:23:02.683 --> 01:23:04.850
Rilla, where's your son?

01:23:07.304 --> 01:23:08.625
Hey yo bruh, I gotta go, man,

01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:09.785
I gotta get my son!

01:23:09.827 --> 01:23:11.422
Where you going?

01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:13.797
All right, I'm out.

01:23:14.701 --> 01:23:15.701
Here I come.

01:23:22.912 --> 01:23:23.869
Cortney!

01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:24.970
What the hell happened?

01:23:25.012 --> 01:23:27.770
Look, Brad, do whatever you gotta do.

01:23:27.812 --> 01:23:29.572
Just calling to see if you're safe.

01:23:29.614 --> 01:23:31.947
Oh yeah, okay, eat a dick.

01:24:08.483 --> 01:24:10.400
Tired of him already.

01:24:15.923 --> 01:24:16.756
Ah, go!

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:19.686
Jesus, get out, go!

01:24:19.728 --> 01:24:20.561
Go!

01:24:27.808 --> 01:24:28.823
- What do you want?
- Where your fucking daughter

01:24:28.865 --> 01:24:30.080

- I don't know.

01:24:30.122 --> 01:24:31.178
Where that bitch at?

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.240
She took my son!

01:24:32.282 --> 01:24:33.532
I don't know!

01:26:04.832 --> 01:26:08.499
Yo, let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:26:16.111 --> 01:26:18.786
911, what's
your emergency please?

01:26:18.828 --> 01:26:20.395
Hello?

01:26:20.437 --> 01:26:21.270
Hello?

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:26.637
2-5 copy, standing by.

01:26:35.322 --> 01:26:36.689
I'm just waiting for the officer

01:26:36.731 --> 01:26:39.731
to come to take the statement, okay?

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.966
How you doing, sir?

01:26:45.008 --> 01:26:45.969
How many dead?

01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:46.966
One.

01:26:47.008 --> 01:26:49.889
Both the mother and son are unharmed.

01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:51.598
- All right.
- Okay.

01:26:58.107 --> 01:27:00.190
I'm Detective Kruthers.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.433
Oh my god.

01:27:05.324 --> 01:27:07.585
There's no way Rilla can deny you.

01:27:07.627 --> 01:27:09.238
You look just like your father!

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.530
You know him?

01:27:11.822 --> 01:27:13.766
Unfortunately.

01:27:13.808 --> 01:27:15.409
There's two other shootings tonight.

01:27:15.451 --> 01:27:17.265
One at Turnt Studios,

01:27:17.307 --> 01:27:18.841
and another one at a recording studio

01:27:18.883 --> 01:27:21.409
owned by Rita Robinson.

01:27:21.451 --> 01:27:22.242
Officer.

01:27:22.284 --> 01:27:23.085
Yes, sir?

01:27:23.127 --> 01:27:24.043
Can you take the boy?

01:27:24.085 --> 01:27:26.502
He doesn't need to hear this.

01:27:29.107 --> 01:27:30.068
I'll be right there, okay?

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:32.652
- It's okay.
- I'll be right out.

01:27:32.694 --> 01:27:34.230
So how many more people have to die

01:27:34.272 --> 01:27:35.855
before you're next?

01:27:36.979 --> 01:27:39.479
Your father is dead right now!

01:27:40.936 --> 01:27:42.999
You gotta stop protecting that guy.

01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:44.791
I fucking hate him!

01:27:46.272 --> 01:27:47.355
You should.

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.063
Come on, let's get some air.

01:27:56.394 --> 01:27:58.151
Let's just go for a ride.

01:27:58.193 --> 01:27:59.392
No, I don't want to leave him.

01:27:59.434 --> 01:28:01.232
Bitch, I said get in the car.

01:28:01.274 --> 01:28:02.065
No!

01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:05.701
Get your ass in the car!

01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:41.674
You telling me

01:28:42.616 --> 01:28:46.449
that your brother in law
fucked your old lady?

01:28:47.828 --> 01:28:50.925
And she raising your
son from another bitch,

01:28:50.967 --> 01:28:55.722
and your baby mama just
popped at your new bitch?

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:59.044
Look, I just killed her bitch!

01:28:59.086 --> 01:29:01.002
And you want us to go down to

01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:03.447
your womans there at the house?

01:29:03.489 --> 01:29:05.329
Bro, you trippin!

01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:06.644
Man, nigga crazy.

01:29:06.686 --> 01:29:08.853
Save all the jokes, man.

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:34.740
What's happening, bro?

01:29:34.782 --> 01:29:37.326
Yo, they kilt the old man.

01:29:37.368 --> 01:29:39.002
What about my son and Ladonna?

01:29:39.044 --> 01:29:41.534
The copper man took her.

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:44.614
And took your son too, brother.

01:29:44.656 --> 01:29:45.656
Man, what?

01:29:53.046 --> 01:29:54.823
What's up, bro?

01:29:54.865 --> 01:29:56.280
Shot it up, man.

01:29:56.322 --> 01:29:57.905
Zina ain't playing.

01:29:59.115 --> 01:30:01.532
Wish I knew where she was at.

01:30:02.566 --> 01:30:03.783
She ain't playing but

01:30:03.825 --> 01:30:04.994

01:30:05.036 --> 01:30:06.253
Shit, we all hot, man.

01:30:06.295 --> 01:30:07.556
I can't even go see my son,

01:30:07.598 --> 01:30:09.105
I can't go to police station.

01:30:09.147 --> 01:30:12.743
I can't do nothing right
now till that bitch is dead.

01:30:12.785 --> 01:30:14.551
I can dig that, but,

01:30:14.593 --> 01:30:16.555
shit, you know I got somebody

01:30:16.597 --> 01:30:18.503
if you need to take care of that shit.

01:30:18.545 --> 01:30:20.712
Shit, somebody like who?

01:30:21.985 --> 01:30:23.872
The nigga really cap, bro.

01:30:23.914 --> 01:30:26.666
I fought the nigga knees back in the day.

01:30:26.708 --> 01:30:29.441
I'm the one that had his
ass out, truth be told.

01:30:29.483 --> 01:30:33.341
But, bro, if you need me, I got you, bro.

01:30:33.383 --> 01:30:34.722
Just let me know.

01:30:34.764 --> 01:30:36.169
All right, let's just
get out of here, man.

01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:37.560
It's two on five over here.

01:30:37.602 --> 01:30:39.269
Shit, say no more.

01:31:14.178 --> 01:31:15.511
Fucker.

01:31:22.197 --> 01:31:23.494
Nigga, this shit look suspect.

01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:24.489

01:31:24.531 --> 01:31:25.722

01:31:25.764 --> 01:31:27.347
You don't trust me?

01:31:28.404 --> 01:31:31.002
Man, you know how many niggas

01:31:31.044 --> 01:31:34.711
I'm here to help you,

This the spot right here.

01:31:40.988 --> 01:31:42.071
Ain't to bad.

01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:50.337
See, this shit cool.

01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:51.712
Relax, my nigga.

01:33:15.249 --> 01:33:16.749
Ah, you made it.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.573
What the fuck?

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.677
You a snitch!

01:33:24.719 --> 01:33:26.656
You a dead ass nigga, nigga.

01:33:26.698 --> 01:33:28.156
- Shut up, man.

01:33:28.198 --> 01:33:29.321

01:33:29.363 --> 01:33:31.321
You're right, he's a snitch.

01:33:31.363 --> 01:33:33.157
He's my snitch.

01:33:33.199 --> 01:33:36.238
And young man, don't let
me see you in here again.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.222
Now get the hell out of my office.

01:33:38.264 --> 01:33:40.264
Thank you, Mr. Warden.

01:33:44.528 --> 01:33:46.028
He's my Takashi.

01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:02.297
And brought you to me, you know why?

01:34:02.339 --> 01:34:06.219
Because I promised that he
won't go back to prison.

01:34:06.261 --> 01:34:07.667
Motherfucker's right.

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:09.714
And you know I'm a man of my word.

01:34:09.756 --> 01:34:13.089
Oh, shit!

01:34:25.521 --> 01:34:29.854
I've been waiting to kill
your ass for five years.

01:34:33.519 --> 01:34:35.852
Hello sir, can I help you?

01:34:37.583 --> 01:34:38.416
Fuck!

01:34:41.239 --> 01:34:44.259
I've had surveillance on your son

01:34:44.301 --> 01:34:46.468
and that bitch over there.

01:34:58.953 --> 01:35:01.313
But she didn't wait, did she?

01:35:01.355 --> 01:35:04.435
She had a little entanglement
with your brother-in-law.

01:35:04.477 --> 01:35:06.310
These hos ain't loyal.

01:35:07.197 --> 01:35:08.379
Fuck you.

01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:12.094
I ain't scared of you, bitch ass nigga.

01:35:12.136 --> 01:35:13.469
Where's my son?!

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:19.689
You gonna die.

01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:20.522
Oh, shit!

01:35:26.739 --> 01:35:29.989
That's a good motherfucking question.

01:35:31.819 --> 01:35:34.319
Now where the fuck is my son?!

01:35:36.722 --> 01:35:38.639
You are not the mother!

01:35:42.835 --> 01:35:45.002
You know what, bye, bitch.

01:35:47.195 --> 01:35:48.269
Please don't kill me,

01:35:48.311 --> 01:35:49.793
- I'm pregnant!
- Fuck out of here.

01:35:49.835 --> 01:35:52.113
As bad as
it hurt to hear her say that,

01:35:52.155 --> 01:35:54.091
Fuck out of here, bitch.

01:35:54.133 --> 01:35:55.081
I
still gotta make sure

01:35:55.123 --> 01:35:55.933
she get up out of here.

01:35:55.975 --> 01:35:58.273
She ain't got nothing to do with it.

01:35:58.315 --> 01:36:01.426
This nigger a dirty ass cop.

01:36:01.468 --> 01:36:03.678
Our son is at the precinct.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.073
You wanna get your son back, right?

01:36:07.115 --> 01:36:08.365
I can help you.

01:36:10.272 --> 01:36:14.269
We just gotta get rid of
these two motherfuckers

01:36:14.311 --> 01:36:18.031
and the system has no choice
but to give him to you!

01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:20.770
'Cause you're his mother!

01:36:20.812 --> 01:36:22.971
Dumbass nigger, she's
gonna kill you anyway.

01:36:23.013 --> 01:36:25.527
Nah, man, I'ma kill you first, nigga!

01:36:25.569 --> 01:36:27.090
For bailing out on us after you got back

01:36:27.132 --> 01:36:29.006
with this bitch?

01:36:29.048 --> 01:36:31.814
I lost my son behind you, my nigga.

01:36:31.856 --> 01:36:35.683
All them niggas I had to kill for you?

01:36:41.788 --> 01:36:43.451
Where you at, son?

01:36:43.493 --> 01:36:45.910
At the police station.

01:36:45.952 --> 01:36:47.202
Where is mommy?

01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:49.490
Hey, baby.

01:36:50.428 --> 01:36:54.891
This mommy, we gonna be
back together real soon.

01:36:54.933 --> 01:36:55.850
I love you.

01:36:56.964 --> 01:37:00.091
This is not my mommy!

01:37:00.133 --> 01:37:01.830
Where is my mommy?

01:37:01.872 --> 01:37:03.510
I want my mommy!

01:37:03.552 --> 01:37:05.359
Son, don't cry.

01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:08.425
Daddy and mommy right here.

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:34.161
Keep my son away from what got me here.

01:37:41.343 --> 01:37:42.182
Baby.

01:37:42.224 --> 01:37:43.395
Hey baby, mommy's right here,

01:37:43.437 --> 01:37:45.270
mommy and daddy, okay?

01:38:35.698 --> 01:38:36.958
The
prosecutor watched the video

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.772
on Zina's phone.

01:38:38.814 --> 01:38:41.436
And seeing that I wasn't
the one that killed Jugg

01:38:41.478 --> 01:38:45.369
or his sister, so they
dropped all charges.

01:38:45.411 --> 01:38:48.014
And who do you think was waiting on me?

01:38:48.056 --> 01:38:48.889
Yup, Rita.

01:38:51.339 --> 01:38:54.456
This woman ain't never turn her back on me

01:38:54.498 --> 01:38:56.478
or act fake with me.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.853
If anything, she pushed me to be better.

01:39:02.477 --> 01:39:04.271
Ladonna's a beautiful woman.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:07.331
Always be mama's baby, right?

01:39:07.373 --> 01:39:09.951
But she
outgrew me a long time ago.

01:39:09.993 --> 01:39:11.918
It's time for her to live her life.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:15.118
I have never seen Ladonna
this happy before.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.970
Cortney's a good dude

01:39:17.012 --> 01:39:19.929
and I know he gonna treat her good.

01:39:22.425 --> 01:39:24.855
Kevin is gonna live in LA with me and Rita

01:39:24.897 --> 01:39:26.730
and Rita's son Johnny.

01:39:28.178 --> 01:39:30.181
As far as me rapping,

01:39:30.223 --> 01:39:33.034
well I ain't ever been no rapper.

01:39:33.076 --> 01:39:34.072
But the wierdest thing happened.

01:39:34.114 --> 01:39:35.811
Do that one more time.

01:39:35.853 --> 01:39:37.206
Rita
still worked her magic

01:39:37.248 --> 01:39:40.814
and finally got her first
male artist to go number one.

01:39:40.856 --> 01:39:43.247
That's right, my son.

01:39:43.289 --> 01:39:44.291
Kevin is the one that'll keep

01:39:44.333 --> 01:39:47.751
my little brother's dream alive.

01:39:47.793 --> 01:39:49.543
