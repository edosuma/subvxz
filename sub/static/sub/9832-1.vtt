01:27.629 --> 01:29.245
Ben?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.170
Ben?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.428
Ben.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.512
Get up, get up, get up.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.675
Late, late, late.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.974
Ben?

01:40.142 --> 01:41.902
Come on, honey. Get up.
We're seriously late.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.560
All right, you may think this
is funny, but this is so not...

01:47.858 --> 01:48.894
funny.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.309
I'm not kidding around
anymore, Ben.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.526
You make yourself appear
right this instant.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.656
Ben?

01:58.702 --> 02:00.034
Ben?

02:00.329 --> 02:03.868
The clock is ticking, Ben.
Come on now.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.661
Ben.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.336
Anna?

02:09.338 --> 02:10.419
Oh, good.
You're already up.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.080
You forgot to wash my shirt.

02:12.382 --> 02:16.092
I told you 100 times, today is
purple shirt day at school.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.048
I didn't forget.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.715
Actually, I was up half the
night thinking about it.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.017
Yeah, right.

02:23.018 --> 02:27.854
And I concluded that you are too
special to look like everyone else.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.559
So, orangy red.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.941
That's your color.
Few can carry it off.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.397
Now, uh... Would you help
me find your brother?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.483
You lost Ben?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.157
No.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.741
I didn't lose Ben.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.194
Ben?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.078
Ben?

02:49.294 --> 02:50.956
All right, Ben. Fine.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.462
You explain to your
teacher why you're late.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.124
Your daddy said he had a very
important case this morning,

02:56.426 --> 02:57.712
and he had to go to work early.

02:58.011 --> 03:02.005
And he left us here to be
responsible, that we could...

03:02.307 --> 03:03.969
Shit.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.180
You're so not funny.
Not funny, and you're also late,

03:07.479 --> 03:10.187
and that means you have to
get dressed right now.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.395
Stay. No. Stay. Ben. Ben.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.903
This is not funny, Ben. We've
got to get you dressed.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.816
We're running so late.
This is not a game. Ooh.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.075
Come on.
Help me out. Ben.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.412
Come on, Ben, really.
We're so late.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.324
I don't want to go to school.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.626
No.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.627
Mommy!

03:31.795 --> 03:34.458
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweetie.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.546
Ben, you look like you're
having such a good time.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.756
- But we're running a little late.
- Ben.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.907
Sweetie, I thought you were supposed
to be wearing purple today.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.718
- She forgot to wash it.
- Oh, hey.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.010
Mmm, what a hug.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.813
I'll handle it
from here, Isabel.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.645
I'm sure you will, Jackie.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.656
Oh, my gosh.
She made you a lunch?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.536
Okay. Come on.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.438
Mom, why do we have to
listen to this classical stuff?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.769
Because I like
it, and I'm driving.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.901
And when you get your own
car, you can pick the music.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.529
Why does Isabel
wear Daddy's underpants?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.815
Doesn't she have
underpants of her own?

04:44.117 --> 04:47.861
Uh, well, I saw a whopping pile of
laundry sitting on the washing machine.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.779
Perhaps Isabel's
underpants are in there.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.947
They're right next
to my purple shirt.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.616
I'm never speaking
to her again.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.002
Never say never.
Here's your vitamins.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.912
She's always
messing up my life.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.047
It's not fair to say always.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.583
I hate her.
She's such a witch.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.343
Hey. No name-calling.
Use your words.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.846
I hate when you say that.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.175
Now that's a beginning.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.215
Hate is a totally
acceptable word.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.120
You just have to be careful
when you use it.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.727
And only use it when you
truly detest something.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.022
Like what?

05:15.106 --> 05:17.849
Well, like... The planet Uranus.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.991
I hate that. It's a
terrible name for a planet.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.277
Your anus.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.062
Yeah.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.981
- And the hokey-pokey.
- The hokey-pokey?

05:25.283 --> 05:26.843
The hokey-pokey.
I hate the hokey-pokey.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.368
Putting your foot in and out
at weddings. It's terrible.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.200
Oh, Ben!

05:32.499 --> 05:35.367
I hate when you do that.
I can smell your breakfast.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.251
Point well taken.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.919
Right here, let's just calm...
Ladies, let's just calm down.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.254
She'll be here.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.169
She will be here.
Isabel, where are you?

05:46.471 --> 05:47.507
Come on. Any word?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.006
Yeah, she's on
her way up here.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.326
She's on her way.
I promise you.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.350
- Oh, really?
- Yes

05:51.476 --> 05:53.342
- How do you know?
- I have sixth sense.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.765
I'm here.
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.099
What a crisis.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.377
White pants, black top, and if it's the
black top, is it the white or black bra?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.642
And I just picked this...

06:00.944 --> 06:01.944
All righty.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.398
I'm here.
I'm lame.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.529
You got a Froot Loop
in your hair.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.954
All right. Get me the
digital camera right now.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.289
Russell, get this out of here,
please. Thank you.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.624
Quick.
Come on, boys.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.584
Here you go.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.436
- Why is she shooting this?
- I don't know why.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.764
Isabel, we have been
waiting for an hour.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.971
I know, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.636
Why are you shooting this?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.434
Because I'm brillant.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.474
And I see something you don't.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.517
So stand back and trust
me, why don't you?

06:43.820 --> 06:44.856
Oh, I trust you.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.715
I just don't understand why you're
shooting the craft service guy

06:47.824 --> 06:51.363
when I've got five male models in
very expensive suits over here.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.659
Thank you, ladies. That's lovely.
It's a wrap, everybody.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.949
No! No, no.
It's not a wrap.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.992
Not a wrap.
She's kidding.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.127
You're kidding,
aren't you, Isabel?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.836
I'm not kidding, actually. And if
you meet me back here in an hour,

07:06.134 --> 07:08.296
I will prove to you
why you hired me,

07:08.595 --> 07:10.075
even though I wouldn't
sleep with you.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.854
She's got such
a great sense of humor.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.444
Let's see if I can save

07:31.743 --> 07:33.655
both our jobs.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.080
Wow.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.541
- The little guy in the suit.
- I like it.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.250
- What do you think?
- I like it.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.087
- I like it. Good work.
- I like it, too. Very creative.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.298
- Congratulations, Duncan.
- Thank you.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.962
Congratulations, Duncan.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.343
Well, the suit
takes pounds off him.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.387
While change is
exhilarating for an adult,

08:01.690 --> 08:04.148
it can be quite
a challenge for a child.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.066
I won't get that.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.613
That's fine.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.658
Change. You were
talking about change.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.819
Well, the fact that
you two are remarrying

08:17.122 --> 08:21.457
obviously has Anna overjoyed, and she's
very excited about the move to Switzerland.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.708
She said we are remarrying?

08:24.004 --> 08:24.878
Mmm-hmm.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.213
And my concern is that Anna seems
apathetic towards her work,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.625
knowing she's leaving
before the semester.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.715
- Mrs. Franklin, we are not...
- No plans on getting...

08:34.014 --> 08:36.506
- Remarried. There's no move...
- To Switzerland.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.390
- No.
- Really?

08:39.686 --> 08:40.802
Really.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.645
Well, then my concern for Anna,

08:43.940 --> 08:45.772
is that she...

08:46.985 --> 08:48.567
- Are you here?
- I'm here.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.214
Because you don't seem
like you're really here.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.238
I'm here.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.718
The judge is about to rule on a motion
that could make or break this case

08:53.742 --> 08:56.262
I've been working on for eight months,
but have I answered my beeper?

08:56.286 --> 08:59.074
So turn it off.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.332
I'm wondering if there's
anything going on at home

09:01.541 --> 09:06.161
that could possibly be intensifying
Anna's need to create this fantasy.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.274
I've been seeing another
woman for the past year.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.193
In the three short years since our divorce,
he's seen a number of women, and...

09:11.217 --> 09:14.572
I saw a few women when we first split up, but
I've been seeing one woman for the past year.

09:14.596 --> 09:18.242
- Without very much warning to the kids...
- After discussion with her and the kids, I might add,

09:18.266 --> 09:20.661
- she moved in last month.
- He's living with a woman half his age.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.621
- Isabel's not half my age.
- We're not discussing your age.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.645
Then why bring it up?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.750
When they go to your house,
they want to be with you.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.265
They want to be
with their father.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.503
When they come to my house,
they want to be part of my life.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.893
Isabel's part of my life.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.439
Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking
about your life, your needs,

09:34.741 --> 09:38.655
but are you really in touch
with what Anna needs?

09:38.953 --> 09:41.866
Anna needs a home where
she feels safe and loved.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.477
- What I'm trying to give her.
- I thought that's what she already had.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.743
I would walk through
fire for Anna.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.045
Gladly.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.545
Any day of the week.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.879
Except Thursday, when Isabel
forgot to pick them up.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.250
Jackie, she was five minutes
late, for Christ's sakes.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.794
- Well...
- She was five minutes late.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.681
I'm wondering if Anna could be
responding to the underlying hostility

10:00.975 --> 10:04.389
that exist between your
girlfriend and Mrs. Harrison.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.475
Well, of course
she's responding to it.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.608
Mrs. Franklin, do you think
any of this is easy for us?

10:10.902 --> 10:12.902
Do you think it's easy for
Jackie to watch her kids

10:12.946 --> 10:14.858
being looked after
by another woman?

10:15.156 --> 10:19.821
Not to mention a woman who really
has no experience being a mother.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.611
Of course, Jackie's going to be

10:21.913 --> 10:24.200
irrational, hostile,

10:24.499 --> 10:25.910
defensive.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.580
Thank you, Luke.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.294
I didn't say that. Why would I say that you
and Daddy are getting back together?

10:37.554 --> 10:41.343
Sometimes people make up stories about
things that they wish would happen.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.036
I don't want that to happen.
Why would I want that to happen?

10:44.060 --> 10:46.143
Okay, pick a card, any card.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.144
Because you're upset?

10:48.439 --> 10:50.351
You know, because
Isabel moved in, and...

10:50.650 --> 10:53.734
I'm not upset. I'm not gonna
get myself upset over her.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.690
Okay, tear it in half.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.232
- Look, sweetie, if it means that...
- Again.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.150
- If you really...
- Again.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.327
- If you want...
- And again.

11:04.873 --> 11:05.989
Time out.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.162
If you don't want to talk about
this now, it's okay, really.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.326
You don't have to.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.042
But don't look me in
the eye and lie to me.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.878
It hurts my feelings,
I get angry, and...

11:17.177 --> 11:20.297
Anyway, you're only allowed so many lies
before it starts showing in your face,

11:20.430 --> 11:22.296
and you wind up looking like...

11:23.933 --> 11:24.683
Like who?

11:24.684 --> 11:28.177
Well, he's not president
anymore, so why be petty?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.936
I'm sorry I said it. I...

11:33.234 --> 11:35.977
I guess sometimes I just...

11:36.279 --> 11:39.488
You know, sometimes I do
wish you and Daddy would...

11:39.782 --> 11:42.490
- Well, you know.
- Yeah.

11:43.328 --> 11:47.413
I figured if I said it out
loud, it just might come true.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.953
Yeah, I know.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.685
It's not that I can't cook,
it's that I choose not to cook.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.061
There's a big difference.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.973
Well, you don't have to cook.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.814
Could we... Save some
of the wine, will you?

12:18.488 --> 12:21.981
- I need it for the sauce.
- It's too late.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.945
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.326
Mmm-mmm.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.708
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.958
- You better get it.
- Okay.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.715
Hello?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.667
<i>Hello?</i>

12:43.221 --> 12:44.257
Who was there?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.467
Nobody there.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.266
- I missed you today. Yeah,
- I missed you, too.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.022
- I miss you every day.
- How was your day, baby?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.557
It was pretty good, except I
gotta go back to Pittsburgh.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.486
No.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.275
Yeah, I gotta go
tomorrow till Sunday.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.982
Oh, but I'll have to order in.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.776
Well, we got the kids
for the weekend,

13:07.078 --> 13:11.823
so I figured that you
and the kids and me

13:12.125 --> 13:14.913
could all go to Pittsburgh.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.669
Yay!
Never gonna happen.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.048
No? Come on, we could
get a great hotel room.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.293
We could go take in a
baseball game or something.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.053
- What do you think?
- Pass. No, no, no.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.466
All right. Well, then I'll
call the baby-sitter.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.975
What for?

13:32.270 --> 13:35.434
I don't expect you
to handle them yourself.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.192
- Hmm.
- What?

13:41.362 --> 13:45.572
Can't handle them myself.
That's what you mean, isn't it?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.072
No.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.627
Hello?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.677
You don't trust me to be
alone with your kids.

14:07.972 --> 14:08.680
Yes, I do.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.094
- No.
- Of course I do. It's just that...

14:11.392 --> 14:13.759
- What?
- Well, that they're a handful.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.305
Luke, by keeping me apart from
them, it's like you're saying,

14:17.607 --> 14:19.644
"Hey, kids, this is fun.
Keep on hating her."

14:19.942 --> 14:21.587
Oh, come on, don't say that.
They don't hate you.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.897
Really?

14:23.488 --> 14:24.649
Look in their eyes, honey.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.529
Look in your ex-wife's eyes.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.861
Jackie's just trying
to protect the kids.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.152
What do you expect?
It's hard for her.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.572
And it's complicated. You don't
understand. You don't have kids.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.366
Okay, um, so,

14:37.668 --> 14:40.706
it's just complicated
for you and Jackie.

14:41.005 --> 14:45.466
For me, it's pretty simple,
because I don't have kids.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.843
Look, I'm trying to
make things work here,

14:48.137 --> 14:50.407
trying to give you guys some time
to get used to living together.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.799
All right, then.
Back off just a little bit.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.640
And give me a chance, okay?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.272
Hello.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.688
<i>Hello.</i>

15:08.991 --> 15:10.732
What is your problem, asshole?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.947
You are my problem.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.159
You're absolutely right, baby.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.287
Your kids don't hate me.
I'm just...

15:23.589 --> 15:26.047
I'm just paranoid.
Call your daughter.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.463
I trust you.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.765
Really?

15:33.975 --> 15:37.139
I'll give you a chance,
if you still want it.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.478
- I do.
- You sure?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.138
Yes.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.440
Okay.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.457
Don't fight
with me when I'm hungry.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.991
So, how long are you
going to be out of town?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.497
Sunday morning.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.157
Well, I'm worried.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.251
About what?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.539
About being alone
with her all weekend.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.125
I mean, what if she
burns the place down?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.256
Well, just keep an eye on her and

16:08.551 --> 16:11.419
make sure you've always got
the fire extinguisher handy.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.591
- You ready to launch her?
- Yeah.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.508
- Okay. Give her a good push.
- Give her a good push.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.646
So, why did she move
in with you, anyways?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.390
Because we love each other and...

16:25.693 --> 16:27.855
because we want to
share our lives together.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.692
Well, you already had
a life with Mommy.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.778
But Mommy and I weren't
getting along very well,

16:34.076 --> 16:37.945
and it wasn't fair to you guys,
us fighting all the time.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.614
I fight with Anna all the time.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.499
Can I move out?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.831
No. But you guys
are brother and sister.

16:46.297 --> 16:50.086
Well, you were husband and wife.
Doesn't that mean something?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.298
Yes. It does.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.216
But... Well,

16:59.936 --> 17:01.643
when you get older,

17:01.938 --> 17:05.396
your relationships get
a lot more complicated.

17:06.817 --> 17:10.231
And there are all kinds
of feelings flying around.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.064
And sometimes,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.279
some of those feelings change.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.744
But did you fall out
of love with Mommy?

17:27.003 --> 17:29.291
Well,

17:31.008 --> 17:32.795
yeah.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.881
I guess I did.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.593
I still love your mom.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.682
It just became a
different kind of love.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.687
That's all.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.976
We're still really good
friends, and we always will be.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.938
Can you ever fall out
of love with your kids?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.526
No.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.402
That is impossible.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.827
- Like <i>Mission: Impossible?
- Yeah. Exactly like Mission: Impossible..</i>

18:11.048 --> 18:13.506
Powdered lizard brains.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.549
Crushed werewolf ears.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.010
And vampire eyes.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.187
Whoa!

18:28.399 --> 18:29.685
God.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.192
Cool.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.496
Check it out.
Magic potion.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.334
It's cocoa.

18:54.634 --> 18:59.299
I put a spell on it. Whoever drinks
it will go to sleep for 1000 years.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.197
Whatever. If you spill
any on my drawing,

19:01.307 --> 19:04.050
I will put you to sleep
for 1000 years.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.352
Hey, you guys.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.683
I have a surprise for you.
Come over to the sofa.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.142
Please?

19:12.193 --> 19:14.776
With a little enthusiasm.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.357
Sit down.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.323
All right, and close your eyes.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.904
Please.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.489
Okay.

19:25.873 --> 19:30.243
Okay, now. Don't open them
till I tell you to, okay?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.415
And open.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.171
- Wow!
- What do you think?

19:35.466 --> 19:36.466
Will he eat my bunny?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.510
No. Puppies
don't eat bunnies.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.670
Anna, what do you think?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.430
Well, I'm allergic to dogs.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.342
Uh, your daddy
didn't tell me that.

19:47.645 --> 19:51.605
Well, he doesn't know much about me.
He's never around.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.061
Why don't we name the puppy?
Puppy needs a name.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.979
I know. Isabel.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.235
I beg your pardon?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.900
Well, he kind of
smells like you,

20:03.202 --> 20:06.195
and I'm allergic to you, too.
Fits perfectly.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.882
Ben, why don't you name that
puppy, and I'll be right back?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.491
Listen, young lady,
let's get one thing straight.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.575
Don't touch my things.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.717
Look, I would really like
it if we could get along.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.885
- I don't have to listen to you.
- Yes, you do.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.645
No, I don't.
You're not my mother.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.273
Thank God for that.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.782
What I meant, and perhaps
I didn't say it well,

20:48.080 --> 20:51.118
is that you have a great mom,
you don't need another one.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.581
But I would like to be
treated with some respect

20:54.879 --> 20:57.041
when you are in this house.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.499
Well, this is my dad's house.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.212
Well, this is my house, too.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.675
Well, this is my room, so treat
it with some respect and get out.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.643
All right.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.742
"Run, run, run,
as fast as you can.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.329
"You can't catch me.
I'm the stinky cheese man."

21:34.627 --> 21:38.462
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
I made it specially for you.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.167
Yes, of course.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.298
Special cocoa.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.636
Delicious.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.603
"A little boy looked up
and sniffed the air,

21:58.901 --> 22:00.642
- "and said..."
- No, now you're cheating.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.857
You skipped the part
about the cow.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.521
Mmm.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.862
It's bedtime. Can we finish
this in the morning?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.198
No. Now we have to start
from the beginning,

22:11.497 --> 22:13.363
and you have to
read the whole thing.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.999
I can't sleep otherwise.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.535
Okay.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.664
"Once upon a time, there
was a little old woman

22:23.843 --> 22:25.209
"and a little old man..."

22:25.511 --> 22:28.345
"Who lived together
in a little old house."

22:28.639 --> 22:30.722
Hey, you are
on to something there.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.632
Why don't you
read to me a little bit?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.973
"They were lonely,
so the little old lady

22:36.272 --> 22:41.518
"decided to make a man
out of stinky cheese.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.186
"She gave him a piece
of bacon for a mouth

22:44.488 --> 22:47.276
"and two olives
for eyes..."

22:49.493 --> 22:52.406
Isabel?
Isabel?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.162
Isabel?

23:00.504 --> 23:04.418
Food poisoning. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.460
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.638
Oh, my God.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.353
What's the matter?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.889
I killed her.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.315
<i>♪ Killed her, killed her ♪</i>

23:26.614 --> 23:27.614
<i>♪ Killed her ♪</i>

23:59.313 --> 24:01.475
- Good morning.
- It is 7:23.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.606
You were supposed
to be here at 6:30.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.063
She has missed her
morning riding lesson.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.649
No, it's Monday. Her riding
lesson is on Tuesday.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.988
Except for the third Tuesday of the
month, which switches to Monday,

24:13.285 --> 24:15.993
and in November, when
she rides on Thursdays.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.779
I mean, it is not
that difficult.

24:18.082 --> 24:22.201
Don't you have some little black agenda
book that you can write all this down in?

24:22.503 --> 24:25.337
May I have a cup
of coffee, please?

24:25.631 --> 24:27.588
We don't have coffee.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.715
Good morning, Betty Ford.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.844
Hey, monkey-man.
Hi, sweetie. How are you do...

24:33.138 --> 24:34.345
Anna?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.549
Anna?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.056
Sweetie, go change your shirt.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.042
What happened to Anna?
What did you do?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.265
Maybe you could just
back off me a little bit.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.308
What happened?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.811
Nothing happened.
I...

24:50.739 --> 24:54.323
Luke was in the shower
this morning, and...

24:54.618 --> 24:59.738
Anna sort of walked in
without even knocking.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.157
Well, I don't see why
that would upset her.

25:02.459 --> 25:07.579
I mean, there have been people in our
family that have taken showers before.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.874
Well, I was in there with him.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.010
And did either of you

25:18.308 --> 25:20.721
talk to her
about it afterwards?

25:21.020 --> 25:25.230
No. I thought it would be
uncomfortable for her.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.274
You mean for you.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.024
A 12-year-old girl is trying
to cope with the fact

25:32.322 --> 25:36.362
that her father is never moving
back in here with his family.

25:36.660 --> 25:41.451
She sees her father naked in the shower
with another woman for the first time,

25:41.749 --> 25:44.537
and you think it would be
better for her

25:44.835 --> 25:46.667
if everyone just pretends
nothing happened?

25:46.962 --> 25:50.706
I am so unbelievably sick
of your imperious bullshit.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.648
I never said I was
June fucking Cleaver...

25:52.926 --> 25:54.821
Look, you don't use that kind
of language in this house.

25:54.845 --> 25:55.947
And if every time
life hits her hard,

25:55.971 --> 26:00.386
you want to have some 12-hour conversation
every third Tuesday of the month,

26:00.684 --> 26:03.017
you go right ahead, lady.
I have a life.

26:03.312 --> 26:07.306
Oh, and I don't?
Because I have children?

26:10.360 --> 26:13.228
You know what your problem is?
You are so self-involved.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.147
You couldn't be a mother.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.362
Maybe the problem
here is your daughter.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.152
And that she is a spoiled,
wise-ass little brat.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.037
Get out of my house.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.198
Get out.

26:25.501 --> 26:29.290
Are you sure? I didn't see
that on the schedule.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.950
Honey, I've got your
Halloween costume.

26:40.974 --> 26:44.012
Let's see if it's
the right size, okay?

26:44.311 --> 26:46.177
A hippie?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.472
Didn't you say you
wanted to be a hippie?

26:48.774 --> 26:50.606
That was last month.

26:50.901 --> 26:54.941
Oh, well, okay. What do you
want to be this month?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.155
Elvis.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.819
Elvis?
What kind of Elvis?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.326
You mean, like black
leather jacket Elvis?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.701
Gold lame Elvis.

27:02.996 --> 27:07.206
Gold lame Elvis. Like, that's
pre-drugs, pre-chubby, pre-army,

27:07.501 --> 27:09.663
- pre-bad-movie, all of that Elvis?
- Yeah.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.874
Oh, honey, um...

27:13.340 --> 27:14.581
Uh...

27:15.676 --> 27:20.341
When Daddy was washing
Isabel in the shower,

27:20.639 --> 27:23.347
what did you think
that was about?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.135
Well, sex, of course.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.887
Oh.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.350
Okay.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.483
Why does Isabel scream?

27:34.778 --> 27:37.065
- Scream?
- During sex.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.071
How do you know
she screams during sex?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.198
I live in the same country.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.903
Um...

27:47.749 --> 27:50.116
- Why are you asking me?
- Just checking.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.206
I like to talk
to you about stuff.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.417
I like talking to you
about stuff, too.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.628
So, since Daddy's
gonna be working,

27:57.926 --> 28:01.215
do you want to do something
on Saturday, just you and me?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.353
Sure, but it's gonna have
to be in the evening,

28:03.640 --> 28:07.554
'cause I'm helping Bonnie Lyons
move into her apartment and...

28:08.395 --> 28:12.514
So you're gonna be with Isabel.

28:12.816 --> 28:13.852
Again?

28:14.151 --> 28:15.642
That really sucks.

28:15.944 --> 28:19.813
Well, you're gonna be at a professional
photo shoot in Central Park.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.074
You guys are gonna
have a lot of fun.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.904
Switch your hands. Put your top
hand down and your bottom hand up.

28:27.206 --> 28:31.291
Dylan, can you take just one step up
for me, please? Just one big step.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.498
Rapunzel, if you could reach
your hand out like that again?

28:34.796 --> 28:37.880
Wouldn't it be cool if her
hair came out of her armpits?

28:38.175 --> 28:40.041
Oh, sick.

28:40.344 --> 28:43.587
I think we can get this
finished before lunch.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.241
All right, folks,
we like this light.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.025
We're gonna try and get
this in before lunch.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.642
Well, come on, it's been five hours.
We're hungry.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.894
Yeah, we're starving.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.727
Um, get yourself another
ice cream, okay?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.142
And I'll be done soon.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.651
I promise.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.521
We're rich.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.700
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.834
Where's your brother?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.956
I don't know.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.002
Ben?

29:25.055 --> 29:26.387
Ben?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.640
What if he's kidnapped?

29:27.641 --> 29:29.849
He's not kidnapped.
He's just... He's hiding.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.143
Ben!

29:31.395 --> 29:32.431
Maybe he's in the castle.

29:32.729 --> 29:37.349
- That's a good idea.
- Don't touch me, you bring bad luck.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.519
Ben!

29:41.822 --> 29:43.529
Ben?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.036
Ben!

29:59.840 --> 30:01.081
Ben!

30:03.218 --> 30:04.629
Ben!

30:06.888 --> 30:09.631
Okay, watch very carefully.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.644
Come on, come on, come on.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.107
All right.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.453
Ben? Ben.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.320
- Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.784
Oh, baby.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.119
- Are you all right?
- I knew where I was all the time.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.011
- I'm sure you did.
- We found him in the zoo.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.292
In the zoo.
My God.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.379
Hold his hand, don't let
him out of your sight.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.758
Jackie, I am so sorry...

30:47.054 --> 30:50.593
I'm gonna say this one
time, so listen carefully.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.808
That woman is to have nothing
more to do with my children.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.139
Our children.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.771
Do you realize what could
have happened to your son?

30:59.066 --> 31:02.525
How lucky we are that the police
found him instead of some lunatic?

31:02.819 --> 31:05.340
I mean, they could... Jackie, you
don't have to make it any worse.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.009
Isabel is sorry. She feels terrible.
It could have happened to anyone.

31:08.033 --> 31:08.908
Not to me.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.741
You've made mistakes.
People make mistakes.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.181
Well, I am not gonna sit here
and wait for the next one.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.245
I'm not gonna watch our children fall
through the cracks of this arrangement.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.144
- Just calm down...
- No, I'm not gonna calm down.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.168
I'm going to a lawyer.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.219
Don't do that. We promised
we'd never do that.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.709
Well, we've broken a lot of
promises, haven't we, Luke?

31:24.007 --> 31:25.464
Don't take this out on him.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.028
- It's my fault.
- Isabel, why don't you just...

31:27.052 --> 31:29.135
Honey, I'm so sorry.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.759
But you're not making this
any easier on anybody.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.345
It is not my job to
make it easier for you.

31:35.644 --> 31:40.560
It is my job to take care of those children,
and they don't want to be with you.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.223
I'm getting a court order,

31:42.526 --> 31:45.860
and you are never going to be
with these children again, alone.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.441
Do you understand?
Ever.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.540
- Mommy?
- What, sweetie?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.130
It's not Isabel's fault that I ran away.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.045
No, you're right.
That was your fault.

32:12.347 --> 32:16.341
But it's her fault for not taking care of
my precious son as if it was her priority.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.135
Which means her
most important job.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.896
Isabel's job is she works.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.977
Ben, mommies work, too.
They work very hard.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.360
In fact, I work harder as a mommy than
I ever did when I had an outside job.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.020
I just don't get paid.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.484
Does Isabel make
a lot of money?

32:31.783 --> 32:32.783
Well, people like Isabel,

32:32.826 --> 32:37.571
who think only about themselves,
often do make a great deal of money.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.868
I think she's pretty.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.124
Yeah. If you like big teeth.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.418
- Mommy?
- What, sweetie?

32:47.716 --> 32:50.880
If you want me
to hate her, I will.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.577
What do you want?

33:18.872 --> 33:20.488
Anna left her soccer
stuff at the loft.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.077
Figured she might
need it this week.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.617
Thanks.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.421
Did you talk to the lawyer?

33:30.675 --> 33:34.419
Yep. I have an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.054
Don't do this.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.495
You're going to tell me not to put
the kids in the middle of a war.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.806
Luke, I'm doing this
for their own well-being.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.345
Partly.

33:44.648 --> 33:47.391
And partly you're doing it
because you're mad.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.059
You know the kids aren't
in any real danger.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.103
This is about Isabel,
and you know it.

33:52.405 --> 33:55.273
She made one mistake,
but she's trying. She's learning.

33:55.575 --> 33:59.159
Oh. Slugs have a faster
learning curve, okay?

33:59.454 --> 34:01.411
Trees. Clams.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.870
Give her some time, will you?
Don't drive her away.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.790
I'm supposed to care about her?

34:09.089 --> 34:11.376
You're supposed to care about
me, like I care about you.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.860
Like you cared about me three
years ago, when you walked out?

34:13.885 --> 34:16.284
- You kicked me out!
- You were gone long before I asked you.

34:16.513 --> 34:22.554
- Don't give me this shit. I was working, for God's sake!
- I didn't have any choice...

34:22.851 --> 34:24.717
I'm sorry. Look,
let's wait a second.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.933
Don't...

34:27.232 --> 34:30.771
Please don't do this thing
with the lawyers.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.813
The kids'll be okay
if we're okay.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.900
I'd do it for you.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.169
Okay, I'm gonna give
you one last chance.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.511
Thanks.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.802
Thanks.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.928
Good night.

35:30.712 --> 35:31.670
This is incredible.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.191
This is the one that I like the best.
She's got a really long...

35:34.424 --> 35:36.882
- She's great in that.
- He couldn't be more flexed.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.715
- Yeah, very studly.
- C-14.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.637
Excuse me.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.011
You know, the way he's leaning
back, and he's more...

35:44.184 --> 35:45.584
Bill. Bill!
Kill that music, please.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.718
No. No, but that looks passive.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.434
This is dynamic. He's going
up, he's gonna get that girl.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.644
You're the photographer.
You're the genius.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.308
Isabel, it's Anna's school.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.024
They're looking for Luke.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.678
- Hello.
<i>- Yeah, I'm looking for Luke Harrison.</i>

36:02.702 --> 36:03.822
No, he's not here.
This is...

36:03.870 --> 36:06.408
<i>The children are here waiting for
their mother to pick them up.</i>

36:06.706 --> 36:08.386
Well, are you sure
you have the right kids?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.578
<i>Yeah, Anna and
Ben Harrison. Why?</i>

36:10.877 --> 36:14.245
Because Jackie Harrison would
never forget to pick up her kids.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.427
<i>I'm sure that's true,
but they're still waiting.</i>

36:16.633 --> 36:17.953
Are you absolutely
sure it's them?

36:18.009 --> 36:19.671
<i>Positive, lady. No
one's picked them up.</i>

36:19.969 --> 36:21.409
Okay <i>. We're locking
up in 30 minutes.</i>

36:21.513 --> 36:22.713
Of course.
I'll be right there.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.173
<i>Okay.</i> I will pick them up.
Thank you.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.011
What?

36:27.310 --> 36:29.914
Isabel, may I remind you that the
clients are gonna be here at 4:30?

36:29.938 --> 36:31.582
- I know, so I have to hurry.
- Is everything okay?

36:31.606 --> 36:33.501
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't worry. I'll be back,

36:33.525 --> 36:35.266
and I will dazzle you
with my punctuality.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.649
Mmm.
To the button.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.653
Isabel, don't do this.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.621
Hi, guys.

36:57.924 --> 37:01.508
- Barbecue. I know they're your fave.
- Wait.

37:04.681 --> 37:08.140
How could she just
forget us? I mean...

37:08.977 --> 37:12.266
Yeah. That's something
you would do.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.732
To tell you the truth,

37:17.861 --> 37:20.774
I did.

37:23.158 --> 37:27.243
Your mother had to help a
friend with this emergency,

37:27.537 --> 37:30.029
and so she called me
to switch days.

37:30.331 --> 37:34.245
But I got caught up at work and
just forgot all about you.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.544
Mommy!

37:35.712 --> 37:37.624
My little chick.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.089
How are you, sweetie?
I'm sorry you got stuck.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.216
Were you scared?

37:44.637 --> 37:46.253
- You must be starving.
- Yeah.

37:46.556 --> 37:47.922
Yeah? You hungry?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.624
- You want a good meal?
- Yeah. Yes.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.516
How'd you do on your math?

38:07.452 --> 38:09.865
Who is it?

38:10.163 --> 38:12.997
It's Jackie.
May I come in?

38:13.416 --> 38:14.702
Sure.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.384
I have another appointment
this afternoon, and I...

38:27.889 --> 38:31.758
I need somebody to take
the children to the park.

38:32.060 --> 38:36.521
And have federal agents jump out of the
bushes and serve me with a court order?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.877
How many years do you get in this state
for giving second-rate care to minors?

38:39.901 --> 38:41.858
Whatever it is,
it's not enough.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.112
Well, look, I'm on thin ice
already with my boss, all right?

38:45.406 --> 38:46.942
Fine. When I ran out
of here yesterday,

38:47.242 --> 38:48.802
I actually thought
he was gonna fire me.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.029
I can get somebody else.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.412
Wait. God.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.617
I'll figure something out.
I'll do it.

39:03.299 --> 39:06.258
After-school snack.
Refrigerate if possible.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.970
Band-Aids, Neosporin, hand
wipes, Kleenex, Tylenol.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.928
Why not just bring
the whole pharmacy?

39:13.685 --> 39:15.405
Ben likes to be read to.
You know <i>Dr. Seuss</i> ?

39:15.603 --> 39:17.185
Not personally.

39:18.273 --> 39:21.311
Do you have a word limit that
you have to hit every day,

39:21.609 --> 39:23.771
or may I finish?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.984
Here's the kids' schedule, my beeper
number, in case of emergency.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.491
If not, I'll see you
at 5:00 at the park.

39:30.785 --> 39:35.200
All I'm asking is that my children
still be alive when I get there.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.492
Jackie, I wanted to
ask you something, uh...

39:41.170 --> 39:43.082
There's a Pearl Jam
concert on the 5th,

39:43.381 --> 39:45.748
and I would like to take Anna.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.009
Is that a weekday?

39:49.929 --> 39:52.262
I think it's a Thursday.

39:52.557 --> 39:57.769
You want to take a 12-year-old girl to
a Pearl Jam concert on a school night?

39:59.397 --> 40:03.107
I just thought it would be something
nice that she and I could do together.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.895
It's ridiculous.
She's too young.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.189
It's spread?

40:44.484 --> 40:46.020
But I did...

40:46.319 --> 40:49.687
I did everything right.
Everything I was supposed to do.

40:49.989 --> 40:55.075
We found some cells in your
lymph nodes, in three of them.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.950
But you said the last
time that you got it all.

40:59.248 --> 41:02.227
So if you were wrong the last time, there's
a good chance you're wrong this time,

41:02.251 --> 41:05.619
- because the last time you...
- The last time was a year ago.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.632
We found a tiny lump, we treated it.
We thought we got it all.

41:09.926 --> 41:13.920
We were hopeful, but there
were no guarantees.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.307
But people... You...
We can beat it.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.264
I mean, you can...
People beat it all the time, right?

41:21.562 --> 41:22.643
Every day, more and more.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.271
Okay.
So, what's the plan?

41:24.565 --> 41:27.808
What do we do? Another
round of radiation?

41:28.611 --> 41:30.443
Chemotherapy.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.656
That's necessary?

41:35.994 --> 41:38.907
Let's give it our best shot.

41:40.206 --> 41:44.541
Right. Okay. Excuse me,
I gotta get the kids.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.873
We'll discuss this
at your next appointment.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.130
And you should share this with
your kids and your ex-husband.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.133
How would his worry or my kids'
worry make any difference?

41:53.428 --> 41:55.420
Sooner than later.

41:56.389 --> 41:57.925
You need to.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.267
Jackie?

42:00.268 --> 42:03.056
Okay. Okay.
Think about it.

42:18.828 --> 42:19.909
Hi.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.365
I see her.

42:26.753 --> 42:27.753
Hi.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.377
- How are you?
- Hi.

42:29.672 --> 42:30.833
Thanks for coming.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.248
You're welcome.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.791
You look pretty.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.459
Thanks.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.680
Listen...

42:38.806 --> 42:41.844
I'm glad you called, 'cause there's
something I want to tell you, too.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.884
Oh. Okay.
Well, you go first.

42:44.187 --> 42:47.021
Well, let me have a drink here.

42:55.031 --> 42:58.399
I'm going to ask
Isabel to marry me.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.072
- Wow.
- Yeah.

43:05.374 --> 43:08.458
I know you don't think
much of her... Oh...

43:08.753 --> 43:10.710
She's a special person. Uh-huh.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.121
She really is, Jackie.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.756
And now... Why are
you telling me this?

43:18.054 --> 43:19.545
I want you to tell me
that it's okay.

43:19.847 --> 43:20.927
You don't need my approval.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.140
The kids do.

43:22.225 --> 43:23.841
- Good evening.
- Ah.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.537
Would you and your wife
care to look at the menu?

43:25.561 --> 43:27.097
- I'm not his wife.
- Oh.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.433
No, thank you.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.352
Give me a drink,
though, please?

43:31.651 --> 43:34.564
This... This...
Whatever this is.

43:35.071 --> 43:38.860
I think it's gonna be
hard for the kids.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.367
And I... I was hoping we
could tell them together.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.450
And that'd make it easier for the kids?
Or for you?

43:45.748 --> 43:47.956
Because, you know, you can't
just decide to be a "we,"

43:48.251 --> 43:49.891
an "us," whenever
it's convenient for you.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.081
- We... No, we are over.
- We are over.

43:52.380 --> 43:56.124
We are still their parents
for the next 100 years.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.524
Why?

44:15.903 --> 44:19.772
Just tell me why
you think this marriage

44:20.074 --> 44:23.408
is gonna work, and ours didn't.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.111
Um, what did you want
to talk to me about?

44:44.223 --> 44:46.260
Nothing. It's, um...

44:47.226 --> 44:51.311
I think we have
quite enough to deal with

44:51.606 --> 44:53.939
just with your news.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.706
Mmm.

45:13.836 --> 45:17.329
- Good morning.
- Good morning, baby.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.548
I got something for you.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.709
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

45:24.472 --> 45:28.716
Mmm. But you have to
wake up to get it.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.051
Oh, okay.

45:36.317 --> 45:37.853
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.315
I'm awake.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.301
Hmm.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.181
Uh...

46:10.476 --> 46:11.434
You shouldn't have?

46:13.729 --> 46:16.437
The first time I got married,

46:16.732 --> 46:19.349
we'd been together
since college.

46:19.652 --> 46:24.488
And marriage just seemed
like the next step.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.613
It was just something
that happened.

46:29.203 --> 46:33.117
But I think for two people
to really love each other,

46:33.416 --> 46:37.285
to really commit to each other,

46:37.586 --> 46:39.543
it has to be...

46:41.257 --> 46:44.045
It has to be an act of will.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.460
Or a decision.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.846
And I think two people
have to live that decision

46:50.141 --> 46:52.133
every day,

46:52.435 --> 46:56.179
even when things are hard
and you feel like giving up.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.563
You have to

46:58.858 --> 47:01.475
hang on to that decision,

47:04.613 --> 47:08.482
that choice to love each other,

47:09.076 --> 47:12.114
even if it's only by a thread.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.114
I...

47:16.125 --> 47:18.663
Let that thread break once.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.546
This time it won't.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.965
Will you marry me?

47:34.268 --> 47:37.011
Yes. Yes, I will.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.599
Sweetheart,
don't get upset.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.238
I'm not upset.
Why would I be upset?

47:52.536 --> 47:55.370
I mean, no one asked me
when you got a divorce.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.576
No one asked me if I
wanted a new mother.

47:57.875 --> 48:00.333
No one even asked me
if I liked her.

48:00.628 --> 48:03.712
If you guys don't care about keeping our
family together, then why should I?

48:04.006 --> 48:07.340
Anna, Daddy and I tried
very hard, really we did.

48:07.635 --> 48:10.423
No, you didn't. All you did was
name-call. I heard you.

48:10.721 --> 48:13.759
You didn't even try
to use your words.

48:14.558 --> 48:15.674
Okay, buddy.

48:15.976 --> 48:19.640
Baby, Isabel's not gonna
take my place as your mom.

48:19.939 --> 48:21.055
No.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.316
It's just that Isabel's
gonna be in your life,

48:24.610 --> 48:28.274
and hopefully you can
learn to accept her.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.313
Hmm?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.823
Oh, sweetheart.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.447
Oh, honey.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.828
You know,
life is full of hard things.

48:44.130 --> 48:46.713
And sometimes
it isn't fair, and...

48:47.425 --> 48:48.836
But, you know,
you have a choice.

48:49.135 --> 48:53.254
You can either take the hard things
and make your life better,

48:53.556 --> 48:55.673
or make it worse.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.511
Like how?

49:01.355 --> 49:06.521
Like trying to see
the good side of Isabel,

49:07.361 --> 49:09.978
and what she brings
to your father's life

49:10.281 --> 49:12.193
and to yours.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.470
You know, there comes
a time in every family

49:15.494 --> 49:18.908
when you've got to
be there for each other.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.455
Okay.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.537
I'll be there for you.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.837
How about you, buddy?

49:28.549 --> 49:29.790
Yeah.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.423
You'll be there?

49:31.719 --> 49:33.005
Yeah.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.189
Oh, damn it.

49:56.285 --> 49:58.618
What's the problem?

49:59.413 --> 50:00.904
Nothing.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.168
It looks good.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.175
I can't get the trees
to look real.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.883
Hmm.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.592
Mind if I try?

50:20.518 --> 50:23.010
I already messed it up anyway.

50:25.689 --> 50:30.275
Let's see. First a
little brush-smooshing.

50:30.569 --> 50:31.650
Smooshing.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.733
Very technical term.

50:49.338 --> 50:51.250
Cool. Where'd you
learn how to do that?

50:51.549 --> 50:54.713
I took an art class
when I was at NYU.

50:57.930 --> 51:01.014
Why don't you give it a try?

51:02.309 --> 51:05.268
It helps if you make
that little "psh-psh."

51:16.156 --> 51:17.442
Thanks.

51:18.951 --> 51:20.658
You're welcome.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.624
I was thinking about
what you said about Isabel.

51:32.756 --> 51:33.590
Uh-huh?

51:33.591 --> 51:35.628
You know, seeing the
good side of her,

51:35.926 --> 51:37.337
and, you know, you're right.

51:37.636 --> 51:39.116
She knows all about
clothes and stuff,

51:39.346 --> 51:42.510
and she knows every rock 'n'
roll song ever written.

51:42.808 --> 51:45.801
I mean, she's kind of
like a kid herself.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.220
- Like a big sister.
- Yeah.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.139
She knows all the cool
junk-food places to eat at.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.774
I'll bet.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.980
Once you get to know
her, she's kind of cool.

51:55.279 --> 51:56.395
Yeah?

51:58.574 --> 52:02.193
But don't tell her
I told you. I...

52:02.494 --> 52:05.202
- I just...
- It's our secret.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.576
Thanks.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.412

- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah.

53:14.566 --> 53:17.604
Mmm. Well, you are one lucky boy,
because, guess what.

53:17.903 --> 53:19.714
You get to watch a tape tonight.
I'm going out.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.024
Colleen's baby-sitting.

53:21.323 --> 53:22.859
Yeah! Cool.

53:23.158 --> 53:26.117
And you are
wearing make-up?

53:26.912 --> 53:29.996
- Well, no. Isabel gave it to me.
- Oh.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.824
No, she just put a little on
in the car, playing around.

53:33.544 --> 53:36.662
Oh. Well, you
don't usually see that color

53:36.964 --> 53:39.331
in the afternoon,
except on working girls.

53:39.633 --> 53:43.092
Anyway, um... Wash your
face, because, uh,

53:43.387 --> 53:45.049
you and I are going out
in 10 minutes.

53:45.347 --> 53:48.010
- On a school night?
- Uh-huh.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.012
- Pearl Jam?
- Yeah.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.518
Oh, Mom, you are the coolest.

53:52.813 --> 53:55.476
You only live once, right?

53:56.024 --> 53:58.687
Isn't my mom the coolest?

54:01.238 --> 54:04.026
It was a great idea.
Thanks.

54:05.284 --> 54:06.650
Have fun.

54:18.046 --> 54:21.005
Chemotherapy. There's a
day's dose stored here.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.213
This is a portable IV.
Feel it.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.132
- It's pretty light.
- Yeah, nice and slim.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.638
You can wear it everywhere.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.548
Play tennis, jogging.

54:30.851 --> 54:34.845
- You can hide it right under your clothes.
- That's cool.

54:35.355 --> 54:36.641
Side effects?

54:37.775 --> 54:40.768
Some days you'll experience
drowsiness, nausea,

54:41.069 --> 54:44.358
and then other days,
you'll feel perfectly fine.

54:44.656 --> 54:46.864
Am I gonna lose my hair?

54:47.159 --> 54:47.950
Maybe.

54:47.951 --> 54:51.410
Maybe not.
It varies with each person.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.946
Let's do it.

54:54.249 --> 54:56.741
- Good.
- When?

54:58.212 --> 54:59.919
I'm available tomorrow evening.

55:00.756 --> 55:03.214
Oh, tomorrow evening's bad.
It's spaghetti and meatball night.

55:03.509 --> 55:08.095
Ben really looks forward...
Okay. Tomorrow's good. Fine.

55:17.231 --> 55:18.231
Hello?

55:18.524 --> 55:20.436
Hi, honey.
How are you doing?

55:20.734 --> 55:23.317
Mom! I've been
waiting for your call.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.945
<i>- Mom, you're not gonna believe it.</i>
- What?

55:26.240 --> 55:29.028
<i>- I'm telepathetic.</i>
- You mean telepathic.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.908
That's what I said.

55:31.203 --> 55:32.910
I just discovered it today.

55:33.205 --> 55:34.867
I can read minds.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.165
<i>No way.</i>

55:36.333 --> 55:38.325
Yeah, I just tried it
with Dad and Isabel.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.835
- And guess what.
<i>- What?</i>

55:41.129 --> 55:44.122
I always knew exactly
what they were thinking.

55:44.424 --> 55:47.167
- That is incredible.
<i>- Want me to read yours?</i>

55:47.469 --> 55:50.303
- Absolutely.
<i>- Think real hard about something.</i>

55:50.597 --> 55:52.759
- I'm thinking.
<i>- Close your eyes.</i>

55:53.058 --> 55:54.674
Okay.

55:54.977 --> 55:59.392
- Concentrate.
<i>- I am concentrating.</i>

56:02.317 --> 56:04.730
You're thinking about me.

56:05.028 --> 56:08.442
Wow. That is amazing.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.231
What else?

56:10.534 --> 56:13.823
And you're wishing you were
here instead of where you are.

56:14.121 --> 56:16.955
Oh, that's for sure.

56:17.249 --> 56:19.206
<i>Where are you, anyway?</i>

56:19.501 --> 56:24.792
I'm in bed with the flu,
and I'm green and barfing.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.547
<i>I knew that.</i>

56:26.842 --> 56:29.209
And you're wishing you were
here making me spaghetti.

56:29.511 --> 56:32.595
So I wouldn't have
to eat Daddy's sucky lamb chop.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.301
Oh, you're right about that.

56:34.600 --> 56:37.684
<i>- See? I'm pathetelic.</i>
- Telepathic.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.186
That's what I said.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.561
- Mommy?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

56:41.857 --> 56:43.098
When am I going to see you?

56:43.400 --> 56:45.312
<i>Tomorrow, after school.</i>

56:45.611 --> 56:50.072
Oh. I was wishing
I would see you tonight.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.741
Well, we're just gonna have to
have one of our dream dates

56:54.036 --> 56:56.369
and meet somewhere
special, in our dreams.

56:56.663 --> 56:59.872
Where haven't we been in a while?
How about Disneyland?

57:00.167 --> 57:02.784
Nah. Last time
the lines were too long.

57:03.086 --> 57:04.998
Okay.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.084
The beach.

57:07.382 --> 57:11.171
Yeah.
On a hot summer day.

57:11.470 --> 57:13.928
With gigantic waves.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.714
- And boogie boards.
<i>- And corn dogs.</i>

57:17.017 --> 57:19.179
Yeah. Awesome.

57:19.478 --> 57:23.597
Cool. All right, now don't forget
to put on your sun block, okay?

57:25.150 --> 57:28.314
It's a dream, Mom.
You don't need sun block.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.525
That's right. I forgot.

57:33.033 --> 57:35.275
<i>- Mommy? You still there?</i>
- Yeah.

57:35.577 --> 57:37.113
Ben,
time for dinner.

57:37.412 --> 57:39.119
I gotta go.
See you tonight, okay?

57:39.414 --> 57:40.780
All right.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.494
I'll see you in my dreams.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.285
<i>- Bye, Mom. I love you.</i>
- Bye.

58:08.777 --> 58:11.269
She doesn't really have that
killer instinct, does she?

58:11.571 --> 58:13.608
Defense, fall back.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.868
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:32.467 --> 58:33.674
Are you feeling all right?

58:33.969 --> 58:36.006
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm great.

58:36.304 --> 58:37.424
You look a little bit tired.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.134
I hate when
people say that.

58:39.433 --> 58:42.972
It's a polite way of telling you
'you look like shit'.

58:43.270 --> 58:48.356
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm just...
- I have some things on my mind.

58:53.321 --> 58:56.405
You've been really busy lately.

58:57.325 --> 59:00.409
Are you seeing somebody?

59:03.790 --> 59:06.373
Ah, no. I wish that was
the reason I was tired.

59:06.668 --> 59:08.250
I... Um...

59:11.048 --> 59:13.290
I've been spending a little
time with my old boss,

59:13.592 --> 59:16.926
trying to decide whether or not I'm
gonna go back to Random House.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.007
- Really? That would be great.
- Yeah.

59:19.306 --> 59:22.299
Oh, Ben.
Easy, easy, easy.

59:25.395 --> 59:27.182
Ben, Ben, Ben, be careful, sweetie.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.723
You are a dead man,
Captain Blood.

59:30.025 --> 59:32.187
Ow!

59:32.486 --> 59:34.899
Ben. Ben.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.533
Ow.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.244
Man, that was really cool.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.451
- Sweetie, can you move your leg?
- Yeah.

59:46.750 --> 59:47.957
- Does it hurt?
- No.

59:48.251 --> 59:49.332
Are you okay?

59:49.628 --> 59:53.668
Yeah, but can I still go
to Tucker's party tomorrow?

59:54.674 --> 59:58.293
Um, probably. But we gotta get it cleaned
up and have somebody look at it, okay?

59:58.595 --> 59:59.835
Gotta go to the emergency room.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.845
Yeah.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.399
- Five stitches.
- Is he okay?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.481
- Yeah, he's doing fine.
- He's not crying?

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.191
Can I see my son now, please?

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.197
I need your
insurance information.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:21.803
- Here, I'll do this.
- Oh, thanks.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.739
He's in 152.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.329
I don't see any broken bones.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.835
'Cause you don't have any.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.294
I'm very proud of you.
You were awfully brave today.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.627
It didn't hurt that bad.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:40.043
Besides, it'll be cool to
show my friends.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:41.345
Yeah.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.466
Hey, would you do me a favor?

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:47.099
Um... Maybe.
Depends what it is.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:50.512
Will you ask Dad to give me
a white dove for Christmas?

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.771
- We'll see.
- Come on!

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.935
Every magician needs a white
dove, a real one. They do.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.819
Well, that's a long way off,

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.594
and I think that we should talk
to your mom and just see, okay?

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:02.903
Ow, ow, ow.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.318
- Did it hurt again?
- Yeah.

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:08.579
Lay back.
Take a deep breath.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:13.993
Will you sing me a song?

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.789
My mom always sings
to me when I get hurt.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.171
Okay, um,

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:27.348
hard to think of
a song on the spot.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:35.356

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:39.235

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.754
A little bit.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.055
Puts a girl
on the spot.

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:13.664
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.994
- Hi, it's Jackie.
<i>- Hi.</i>

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.205
Look, I just got a call
from Random House,

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.943
and they want me to come in and
meet an editor this afternoon,

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.371
but I'm afraid I won't get back in time to
pick up Ben at Tucker's birthday party.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.754
- Do you...
<i>- Yeah, no problem. I can do it.</i>

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.053
Oh, good, great.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.221
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.301
Yeah, well...

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.175
Ben'll be happy, too,

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:35.886
that you'll pick him up, yeah.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.179
<i>- What time?</i>
- It's 4:30.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.481
<i>What's the address?</i>

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:42.183
At 22 Williams Road.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.570
<i>Okay, I'll be there.</i>

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:45.696
Great.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:47.401
<i>Sure. See you later.</i>

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.565
- Thanks.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:38.656
How hard can this be?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.006
Okay.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.801
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.583
<i>Directory assistance. What city?</i>

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.018
- Manhattan.
<i>- What listing?</i>

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:05.979
The number for
Random House, please.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.643
<i>Please hold.</i>

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.115
<i>Hello.</i>

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.982
Hi, may I speak with
Jackie Harrison, please?

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.446
<i>I'm sorry.
Mrs. Harrison's not here.</i>

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.862
No, she has a meeting
with the editor today.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.203
I'm picking up Benjamin from a birthday
party, and I lost the address.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.493
I just need to speak to her
for one quick second.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:25.127
<i>Um, Miss, I'm the senior editor.</i>

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:31.043
<i>I haven't seen Mrs. Harrison since
she left Random House 11 years ago.</i>

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.841
Uh, okay.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.676
Um, thanks anyway.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.058
<i>- Balloons.</i>
- I beg your pardon?

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:44.723
<i>Just look for a house with balloons.
It never fails. The kids'll be there.</i>

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.981
Thanks very much.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:32.863
Hey.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.231
Hey, look at you.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.240
Come here.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.401
Can you see me?
Hi.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:40.820
You had a good time, huh?

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.238
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.244
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.034
Let's get that shirt cleaned.
How was Tucker's party?

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.124
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.455
- Did he like the present?
- Yeah.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.465
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.630
Did they have
the snake guy or...

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:56.678
Snake!

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.261
The snake guy.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.555
It bit Tucker.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.433
- It bit Tucker?
- Did it eat him?

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.924
Did you have any trouble finding
the place with my directions?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.589
No.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.427
Well, thanks.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.891
I know your secret.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.774
I saw the airline tickets and
the note from your new boss.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:00.237
I know you're not working at Random
House in New York. I talked to them.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.323
You're taking the kids
and moving to Los Angeles.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:07.285
What the hell are you doing reading my
mail and snooping around behind my back

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.746
like some little dishonest...

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:15.506
Dishonest? I wouldn't have to snoop
around if you were honest with Luke.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.792
I would have thought this was
the answer to your prayers.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.679
You lose the witch and her two
little brats in one swoop.

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.840
Simplifies everything.
You get your life back.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.462
Come on. There are plenty of
publishing houses in New York.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.178
Surely you can get a job here.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:33.770
So I'm supposed to rearrange my life so
that I can accommodate your schedule?

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.399
If you are so damned concerned,

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:36.935
why don't you get a new career?

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.104
Why don't you and Luke
move to Los Angeles?

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:43.321
Oh, but you can make plans to rearrange
everyone else's life without consulting us.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.203
Bicoastal parenting.
People do it all the time.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.296
Luke gets the kids one month during
the summer and every other holiday.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.060
It's not ideal,
but people make it work.

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.747
No, you can't do that. You can't
take Luke's kids away from him!

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:54.880
Yes, I can.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.167
No, we can't live like that.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.957
We?

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.738
Look. Luke has a problem with this,
you tell him to talk to me.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.179
This is not about you.
This is not your problem.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.635
It is my problem.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:07.140
Why is that?

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:12.013
Because I'm going to marry this man and
we're going to share our life together.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.022
I love him.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:21.068
These kids are everything to him and he
would be devastated not to be near them.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.198
And if...

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.118
Huh.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.800
You guessed the wrong secret.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.974
Charlie Drummond is, um,

01:09:56.275 --> 01:10:00.394
a colleague of mine from Random
House in New York, and she...

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.656
She moved to the west coast office
and I'm gonna be crashing with her

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:07.034
while I'm getting
protein injections

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:10.241
that are recommended
by my oncologist.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.203
You can only get
them in Los Angeles.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.367
Oncologist?

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.662
Yeah.
Life's a tradeoff.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:22.299
It's finally legal to smoke dope,
but you gotta have cancer.

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:29.302
Are you dying?

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:37.310
Not today.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.566
We'll beat it.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.532
- It's a walk in the park.
- Yeah.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.323
Thanks for the "we."

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.955
You're not alone
in this, you know.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.341
You don't have to go
through this by yourself.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.342
You know that.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:10.389
You understand what I'm saying?

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.897
What are we gonna
tell the kids?

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.862
I think we should
tell them the truth.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.536
They can handle it.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.458
It should have
been me instead of you.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:48.127
I'll go along with that.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.810
Look out.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:06.603
You didn't see.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:08.238
Whoosh! Gotcha.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.094
I don't
understand what to do.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:12.118
They're organic.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.574
Did he beat you?
Here, look, 35 marshmallows.

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:17.615
35. Your sister put them in.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.535
So, what's going on?
Who's gonna marry who this time?

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.124
Mommy's marrying Isabel.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:24.381
Oh, so cute.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.296
Oh, no.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.755
Guys, Mommy's sick.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.054
You still have the flu?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.339
No, I have cancer.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:35.883
Do you know what that is?

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.854
It's what Aunt Mary died from.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:43.064
Aunt Mary had a different kind.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:47.854
There are lots of different kinds,
and hers was very, very bad.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.157
Is yours bad?

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.740
I've been working with a doctor
to get better for a while now,

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.327
and she says we have
every reason to hope

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.958
that I'm gonna be fine.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.254
Huh.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:06.959
Check this out, Anna.
Look at this.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.258
This is so cool.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:09.920
No, it's okay.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:14.074
Look at this. I don't even have to go
to the hospital to get my medicine.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.098
It comes right in this.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.427
This looks like Game Boy.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.763
It kind of is, huh?

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.181
It's gonna make me strong,
so I can fight the disease.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.309
It's cool, huh?

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:25.724
Can I catch cancer?

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.440
No, sweetie.
It's not contagious.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:32.027
So you've known about
this for a long time?

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.737
Yeah.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.402
And you never told me.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:41.165
Sweetheart, your mom wanted to wait
until the right time to tell you.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.873
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.
Look, I just...

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.438
I know how scared
I get when you're sick,

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:51.129
and I thought it would be best to wait
for a while until it got smaller.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:54.044
So you lied! You lied
when you never told me.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:57.590
If you lied then, maybe you're lying now.
I can never believe you again!

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.930
I made a mistake.
Anna, people make mistakes.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.849
- Where's Isabel?
- What?

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.001
It's Thursday. We're
supposed to be with Isabel.

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.210
She should have
picked us up by now.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.234
I'd rather be with Mommy.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.940
Well, she's dying.
Isabel is your mother now.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:13.195
Anna, don't say that!

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.196
Anna!

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:21.075
You do not run out
on your mother.

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.620
No, that's your job.

No way! I can't believe
she would...

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:57.213
After the way he was
with all the girls in the class.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.975
Oh, how... I didn't know
anything about this.

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.463
She was afraid you'd
make a big deal about it.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:05.167
They've been going out for two weeks, which
of course in the 6th grade doesn't mean anything.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.260
They don't go anywhere.
They don't even have lunch together.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:11.199

I had kids of my own once.

in the lunch yard,

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:18.077

Anyway, that's the whole
point of going out, right?

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:27.983
So that one of them
can dump the other one,

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:32.933
and they can act out this passionate,
adult soap opera tragedy.

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:34.308
She must be devastated.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.747

and he's with 10 of his
butt-kissing little weasels...

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.433
Ooh, you don't
like his friends.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:04.566
They all yell, "There goes the
virgin queen" or "the ice princess"

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.228
or some real clever cut like
that, like it hurts my feelings.

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.943
You didn't let him kiss you.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.574
Not with my mouth open.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.577
That's my girl.
Good for you.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:22.288
Does that mean, though, that you let
him kiss you with your mouth shut?

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.461
Mom.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.328
Oh, sorry.
Okay, right.

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:29.207
What do you say to him when
he says something like that?

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.924
I call him a fart face or pervert
or something equally lame.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.839
Sweetheart, you have
to just ignore him.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.975
He doesn't exist. You don't see him.
You don't hear him.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.306
He's just nothing.
He's not there.

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:43.688
You are too much
of a woman

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:48.898
to even bother with such
a little boy as him.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:50.863
You're kidding, right?

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:52.730
No, all he wants
is the attention.

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:55.241
Once he doesn't get it,
he might try harder,

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:58.028
but then he'll get
frustrated and give up.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.447
So I just ignore him,
keep my mouth shut.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.160
Yep.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.040
Well, you think Isabel
would do that?

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:12.967
It's just she's younger.
Maybe she remembers how to do this.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.466
So this'll work, huh?

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.355
Hi, sweetie.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.733
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:12.860
Is it time for you to go to LA?

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:16.899
No, it's still night time
and it's snowing.

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.488
I got a baby-sitter
for Ben.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:23.450
Do you want to go someplace
special with me right now?

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:24.749
Yeah.

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:27.250
Okay. Just you and me.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:07.411
I'm never, never
going to forget this.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.996
Never say never.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:12.899
There's a loophole, you know.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:19.261
You can say "never, never" if you
mean it enough to say it twice.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.224
I'll remember always, always.

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:34.229
Promise, promise.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:04.135
<i>Let's have that carriage move back
to the end of the street and start again.</i>

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.221
<i>Everybody, keep moving.</i>

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.930
<i>Go back to the starting point,
turn around and come back.</i>

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.233
It's 1:45.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:19.612
Want a lens?

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:21.613
Thanks, everybody!
That's a wrap!

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.651
Thank you for
a great day, folks.

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.306
<i>- That's a wrap everybody.</i>
- No.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.743
It's 1:45. I told you I have
to pick up Anna and Benjamin.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.498
Thanks, guys.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.203
You're not...
You have to finish.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.942
No. I've got it. It's in the can.
Coop can wrap the equipment.

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:37.255
This is my star account.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:40.508
These clients need choices.
They need variety.

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:44.011
I've shot at 20 different angles,
so they'll have plenty of variety.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.639
- Trust me.
- I don't.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:51.515
What are you saying?

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:56.771
I'm saying that...
That you're the best I've got.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.777
Probably the best
I've ever worked with.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:04.191
But these last couple of
months, your work is slipping.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.985
It's still fine,
but you've lost your edge,

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:10.121
your focus, your dedication.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.616
And your attitude

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:16.332
is very disappointing.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:21.083
You're making
a career decision here.

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:26.676
If you walk now, I'm gonna
have to let you go.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:37.432
I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:42.528
Isabel.

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.908
Oh, damn.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:54.032
It's okay, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.719
Hey, guys.

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:16.637
Sorry I'm late.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:23.652
- Hey, Benjamin?
- Yeah?

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:25.467
Why don't you go sit
in the car, buddy?

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:26.699
Okay.

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:29.568
- Don't drive away.
- I won't.

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:31.819
What happened?

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:37.458
You know that boy I was telling
you about, Brad Kovitsky?

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:39.085
Yeah.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.211
Well, he's been
a real jerk lately.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.247
My mom told me to ignore him.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:44.836
So today,

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:46.501
I did.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:49.090
- And you know what he called me?
- No.

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:53.929
He called me "Frosty the Snow
Bitch" in front of everyone.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.353
Well, men can be scum.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:27:59.392
Yes, they can.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.811
Is that little bastard around here?
I'll kick his ass.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.690
No, his mother's
always on time.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:11.074
I have an idea.

01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:14.533
No, thanks. I don't need
advice from a stepmother.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.574
Oh.

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.623
Okay, yeah.

01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:26.667
I can see how sitting out here
in the cold and snow, crying,

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:32.760
seems like a far superior idea
to listening to a stepmother.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:36.847
But, for kicks,
let's lose the title.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.095
Seems to me you have a choice.

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.138
You can either pretend
to be an adult,

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:43.398
or you can actually be one.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.026
So,

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:50.611
sit here in the cold, crying,

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:53.527
by yourself,

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:58.369
or do something about it,

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.203
together.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:03.294
Crying.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.917
Do something.

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:09.170
Hmm?

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.383
What's it gonna be?

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.552
Do something.

01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:18.434
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.811
Well, can we start by covering
up my hairy stepmother wart?

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.818
Because it must be showing.

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:30.988
You punk.

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:34.526
It's cold. Come on, let's go.
Benjamin will drive us home.

- after school...
- Oh, come on!

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:53.716
...you walk up to him
with attitude.

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.846
You hear me?

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:59.555
And you say,
"Listen up, limp dick,

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.723
"'cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:12.068
"As far as your pitiful knowledge
of what a woman really wants goes,

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:21.914
Uh...

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.790
What is it?

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:25.876
Hmm. Uh...

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:30.339
It's an...

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:33.074
It's an incredibly disgusting and
not even remotely sexy thing

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:36.387
that I once heard described in a movie
that I would never take you to go see.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:37.922
But it is real.

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:39.886
Now,

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:42.051
the clincher.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.308
You walk away,

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.690
then you

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:50.101
whip around

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:52.440
and say,

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.197
"The guy I see
is in high school,

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:57.734
"and it has to be said,

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:02.451
"he laughs his ass off
whenever we talk about you."

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:05.617
But I don't know anyone
in high school.

01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:08.787
There will be a suitable boy

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:14.881
outside your school on Monday at
2:30 with a very expensive bike,

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:17.420
and he will be a stone fox,

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:20.635
even if I have to call
an escort service.

01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.684
I've had the worst day,

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:25.515
until now.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.682
Me, too.

- Thanks.
- Okay?

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.337
Surprise!

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:57.964
Why is she in a wheelchair?

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:02.553
She's traveled a long way and she's tired,
so give her a hug and be real gentle.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.309
Look at this guy.
Hi!

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:08.186

What a great surprise.

Hey, let me out!
Come on!

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:30.088
- Who's gotta get out?
- Let me out!

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.168
- Hey!
- Sorry.

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:34.963
I'm in the family, too,
you know.

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:36.590
Thank you.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:46.310

We have a surprise for you.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.265
- No way!
- Yes.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.250
- What is it?
- We can't tell you. It won't be a surprise.

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:52.390
Yes, you can. Tell me.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:54.649
- Ben, tell me.
- No way.

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:57.106
- Come on, tell me.
- No way.

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.405
Close your eyes.

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:02.825
Step, step.

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:06.078
No, almost. You're almost there.
Don't open your eyes.

01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:07.954
Come on, please,
just a little peek?

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:09.831
Oh, gosh.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.617
No, wait. Come in.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.411
Come in.
All right, ready?

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:17.127
One, two, three, open!

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.558
Oh.

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.565
Wow.

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:46.118
Isn't it great?

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:48.244
Isabel did it.

01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:03.544
- Isabel.
- Yeah?

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:07.716
Um, I'm working on a Christmas
project for Ben and Anna,

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:11.010
and there aren't any recent
photos of me with the kids,

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:14.476
and I was... I was
just wondering if, um,

01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:16.686
you'd take some.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.398
Sure. Love to.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.987
Thanks.

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:30.367
Hey, guys, wait up.
Wait up for me.

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:39.876
Stop right there for a second.
Oh, great.

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:41.842
Perfect.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.252
Benjamin, that's a dazzling
display of horsemanship.

01:34:44.554 --> 01:34:47.422
Come on, you lazy horse.
Giddyap!

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:50.011
No, no!

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:02.687
"One day, five men
came in very funny hats

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:09.156
"to pick the biggest, fastest, roughest
bull to fight in the bullfights in Madrid."

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:36.095
Hi, Mom!

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.976
Anna, Anna, Anna!
Whoa!

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:49.067
Are you okay?
There we go.

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:51.119
Almost.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.288
Well, almost not falling.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:56.039
That was the first time he fell.

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:59.418
Awesome fall.
You're gonna try it again?

01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:00.712
Yeah.

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:01.713
One over here, everybody.

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:05.465
- Oh, cheese!
- Cheese.

01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:08.844
- Are you gonna go back?
- Yeah.

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:10.174
- For more?
- Yeah.

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:11.589
All right.

01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:14.133
Go for it.
I'm watching.

01:36:20.566 --> 01:36:23.126
You know, Ben was born in two hours,
went straight to the breast,

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:25.941
and camped there
for the next four days,

01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:30.074
always with this mischievous
look on his face,

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:33.281
like he had a secret
or something.

01:36:33.579 --> 01:36:37.448
And his, uh, blanket
always looked like a cape.

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.288
Even the nurses said so.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.583
He loves hearing that
story over and over,

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:46.965
about how he was
born a magician.

01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:49.421
And her?

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.804
Twenty-eight hours.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:56.054
The doctors wanted
to go in and get her, but...

01:36:56.352 --> 01:36:58.264
I knew she'd come
in her own time.

01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:01.021
That's just the way she is.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:03.899
Can't let anybody rush her.

01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:07.527
I'll keep that in mind.

01:37:09.782 --> 01:37:11.648
Ow!

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.047
Didn't work, did it?

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.965
I'm sorry.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:36.553
Hey, you did
everything you could.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:39.619
But there's still
some options available.

01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:42.228
There's a treatment in Paris,
one in Switzerland,

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.803
and they come
highly recommended.

01:37:43.983 --> 01:37:45.645
Thanks, but...

01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:51.029
I think I wanna spend
my time at home,

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:53.816
with my family.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:57.119
Yeah.

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:03.534
Christmas will be here
before you know it.

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:45.732
I thought you might
need one of these.

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:46.953
I do.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:48.712
It looks great.

01:38:58.141 --> 01:38:59.382
Wait a minute.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:00.925
A little more.

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.435
A little more.
Okay.

01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:06.016
I think that's fine.
Stop.

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:07.772
Oh, perfect.

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:11.018
Smells great, too.

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:12.946
Mmm.

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:14.321
Thanks.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.584
What are we supposed
to do without you?

01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:34.876
You'll be fine.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:38.382
You're a great father.

01:39:43.352 --> 01:39:45.059
I just never really...

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:49.268
I didn't give you
the chance to realize it.

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:57.614
Thank you.

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:03.445
Merry Christmas.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:26.552
As for your pitiful knowledge
of what a woman really wants,

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.937
I'm not wasting my time
on some pathetic loser

01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:30.792
who doesn't even know
what snow-blowing is.

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:31.852
Ooh, loser!

01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:33.687
Anna, good one.

01:40:33.986 --> 01:40:36.148
Oh, and the guy I see
is in high school,

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:41.909
and it has to be said that every time we
talk about you, he laughs his ass off.

01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:43.819
Yeah, right.

01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:48.161
You don't believe me?
He's standing right over there.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.253
No way.

01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:03.679
Well, believe it.

01:41:12.108 --> 01:41:13.974
You rule, Anna!
You really rule!

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:15.643
- You blew it.
- Loser.

01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:18.813
- He's a model.
- You're such a retard.

01:41:19.115 --> 01:41:21.823
- Loser.
- Yeah, I know.

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:26.069
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:28.739
I'm here to pick up
my kids from school.

01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:31.374
Who is that?

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:34.940
He looks familiar. He looks like
that guy that's in his underwear

01:41:34.964 --> 01:41:36.400
on the side of a bus
for Calvin Klein.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:37.784
No, fully dressed
for Ralph Lauren.

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:38.883
- What?
- What?

01:41:38.884 --> 01:41:39.884
- Huh?
- No.

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:41.418
Oh!

01:41:42.805 --> 01:41:44.592
Go, Anna!

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.636
He's such a loser.

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.727
Moron.

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:58.314
Oh, it worked, it worked,
it worked, it worked!

01:42:00.656 --> 01:42:02.397
Did you see the look
on Brad's face?

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.158
- Thank you so much!
- Oh, honey.

01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:13.580
Okay, "limp dick" I know.

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:16.586
What exactly
is "snow-blowing"?

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.672
It doesn't matter. I
didn't explain it to her.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.447
You're gonna have
to explain it to me,

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:23.950
because I'm gonna have to explain
it to about 20 or 30 parents

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:25.925
that are gonna call
in the next half-hour.

01:42:26.223 --> 01:42:27.098
Give them my number.

01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:29.967
I think they're gonna wanna talk
to Anna's mother, thank you.

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:34.263
What is it that you're worried about?
Looking bad at the PTA?

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:36.022
Are you defending what you did?

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:37.233
Right to the ground.

01:42:37.234 --> 01:42:38.545
You put filth
in my child's mouth.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:40.686
- Oh, please.
- You had her lie about that model.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:43.981
And it worked like a charm.

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:47.902
And you became a hero,
and I became a schmuck.

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.697
Basically, you taught my child

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:56.790
that I am a loser who doesn't
really care about her pain.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:58.448
That's not what
I was trying to do.

01:42:58.547 --> 01:43:00.334
Well, that's what you did.

01:43:00.633 --> 01:43:04.343
Did you think that I didn't have some
dirty words for that little putz?

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:06.378
That I couldn't figure
out some low blows?

01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:07.922
You weren't passing them out.

01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:11.638
I believe, in a crisis, you have
an opportunity to learn something.

01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:13.802
That's deep.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:15.641
It was a lie.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:19.229
Winning without dignity
or grace is not winning.

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:22.941
She has to figure out who she is so
she can stand up to peer pressure,

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:25.322
so that she can steer
her own course.

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:29.610
She wasn't steering her own course.
She was steering yours.

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:33.155
Oh! That's what parenting
is all about, little girl.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:36.291
They are pleading for you to tell
them how to do the right thing,

01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:38.952
and sure as hell,
that's what you've done.

01:43:39.255 --> 01:43:42.293
The next time something happens
and the stakes are really high,

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:44.711
she's gonna look back on this
and she's gonna remember

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.672
how easy it was
and how good it felt.

01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:50.555
And she's going to stand up for herself.
Dear God, what have I done?

01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:54.343
You have turned her into you.

01:43:56.313 --> 01:43:58.851
That's what this is about.

01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.150
That's all this is about.

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.901
Oh, how would you know
what this is about?

01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:04.795
You haven't been here
from the beginning,

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:08.073
worrying every minute of every day
that the decisions you're making

01:44:08.367 --> 01:44:11.110
are gonna shape the people
that they are going to be.

01:44:11.412 --> 01:44:15.156
And you are not what
I want my children to be.

01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:22.000
I don't want that either.

01:44:23.215 --> 01:44:27.710
But this isn't about me or you.
It's about them.

01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:31.801
And believe it or not,
I am trying.

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:38.972
And I do have their very
best interests at heart.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:12.321
- Would you like a drink?
- Patron, please, double.

01:46:14.243 --> 01:46:15.905
What's up?

01:46:23.794 --> 01:46:26.502
Last year, I lost Ben.

01:46:27.423 --> 01:46:30.541
- What?
- In the supermarket.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:34.419
You're lying.

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:36.509
It's true.

01:46:36.807 --> 01:46:41.552
That's impossible. You could never
lose that kid for one second.

01:46:44.607 --> 01:46:45.768
I did.

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:49.771
Ben never mentioned it.

01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:53.321
He just remembers I found him.

01:46:54.366 --> 01:46:56.949
Why didn't you tell me?

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:01.575
You know why.

01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:11.332
I never wanted to be a mom.

01:47:14.303 --> 01:47:17.387
Well, sharing it
with you is one thing.

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:20.806
Carrying it alone
the rest of my life...

01:47:23.687 --> 01:47:26.521
Always being compared to you.

01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:29.645
You're perfect.

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:32.610
They worship you.

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:38.154
I just don't want to be looking over
my shoulder every day for 20 years,

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:41.320
knowing

01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:44.786
that someone else
would have done it right,

01:47:45.084 --> 01:47:47.041
done it better,

01:47:47.336 --> 01:47:49.794
the way that I can't.

01:47:50.464 --> 01:47:53.457
What do I have that you don't?

01:47:54.718 --> 01:47:57.210
You're Mother Earth incarnate.

01:47:57.513 --> 01:48:00.802
You're hip and fresh.

01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:04.093
- You ride with Anna.
- You'll learn.

01:48:09.358 --> 01:48:11.975
You know every story,

01:48:12.277 --> 01:48:14.894
every wound,

01:48:15.197 --> 01:48:17.029
every memory.

01:48:19.785 --> 01:48:24.155
Their whole life's happiness
is wrapped up in you.

01:48:24.456 --> 01:48:27.369
Every single moment.

01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:32.708
Don't you get it?

01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:38.089
Look down the road
to her wedding.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:45.342
I'm in a room alone with her,

01:48:48.897 --> 01:48:50.934
fitting her veil,

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.646
fluffing her dress,

01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:57.896
telling her,

01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:01.782
"No woman has ever
looked that beautiful."

01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:13.957
And my fear is

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:17.415
that she'll be thinking,

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:24.005
"I wish my mom was here."

01:49:27.352 --> 01:49:29.685
And mine is

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.347
she won't.

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:40.443
But the truth is

01:49:40.908 --> 01:49:43.571
she doesn't have to choose.

01:49:44.745 --> 01:49:47.533
She can have us both,

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:50.782
love us both.

01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:55.833
And she will be a better
person because of me

01:49:56.548 --> 01:49:58.790
and because of you.

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:03.841
I have their past,

01:50:06.809 --> 01:50:09.597
and you can have their future.

01:50:29.498 --> 01:50:31.330
Hey, guys,
it's Christmas!

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:32.542
Wake up!

01:50:32.543 --> 01:50:35.456
I hope there's a white dove.
I hope there's a white dove.

01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:38.212
I hope there's a white dove.
I hope there's a white dove.

01:50:38.507 --> 01:50:40.214
There's gotta be a white dove.

01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:43.422
Hark, I hear the gentle
sounds of Benjamin.

01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:49.766
We'd better get out there before he
starts ripping open all the presents.

01:50:51.937 --> 01:50:56.398
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,
have a little patience.

01:50:57.442 --> 01:50:59.399
Can I open my presents now?

01:51:00.028 --> 01:51:03.021
Um, actually, your mom wants
you guys to go upstairs

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:07.693
and open presents with her first. And
then we'll open presents down here, okay?

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:09.987
Hmm, okay.

01:51:10.289 --> 01:51:12.030
Me first.

01:51:32.686 --> 01:51:34.598
Merry Christmas.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.099
Sweetie, I think this
has your name on it.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.659
Wow, a real magician's cape!

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:55.869
- Awesome!
- Whoa.

01:51:56.752 --> 01:51:58.709
Here. Come here,
I'll help you with it.

01:51:59.004 --> 01:52:01.212
What does it have all over it?
Could you see?

01:52:01.506 --> 01:52:02.997
Pictures of me and you.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.758
And this one right here?
See that one?

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:09.217
That's our first official photo
of you and me as a couple.

01:52:09.514 --> 01:52:10.514
See that?

01:52:10.724 --> 01:52:13.182
Did you know I was
good-looking right away?

01:52:13.477 --> 01:52:16.891
Everybody in the whole hospital was
talking about it. Are you kidding?

01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:20.853
But this good-looking
was beyond my imagination.

01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:27.522
Are you dying?

01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:34.953
What do you think?

01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:36.911
Yes.

01:52:37.209 --> 01:52:40.202
Then I won't see you anymore.

01:52:40.837 --> 01:52:44.421
Well, you won't
see my body, but...

01:52:44.716 --> 01:52:48.926
You know how a caterpillar
becomes something else?

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:52.972
- A butterfly.
- Yeah.

01:52:53.267 --> 01:52:56.385
You just have to
think of me as, um,

01:52:56.895 --> 01:52:59.262
off flying somewhere, hmm?

01:52:59.564 --> 01:53:02.432
And, of course, the magician

01:53:02.734 --> 01:53:04.475
knows the secret,

01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:07.695
that just because you
don't see something,

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.323
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:53:13.954 --> 01:53:17.868
So even though it might
seem like I'm gone,

01:53:18.333 --> 01:53:20.950
the magician knows better.

01:53:22.254 --> 01:53:24.792
So where will you be?

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:30.760
Right here.

01:53:31.054 --> 01:53:34.968
Right here,
inside the magician.

01:53:35.767 --> 01:53:37.679
Can I talk to you
when you're there?

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:40.220
Always.
Always, always.

01:53:40.522 --> 01:53:44.562
You won't hear my voice,
but deep inside,

01:53:45.235 --> 01:53:48.444
you'll know what I'm saying.

01:53:50.115 --> 01:53:51.526
It's just not good enough.

01:53:51.825 --> 01:53:52.986
No.

01:53:53.285 --> 01:53:57.871
No, of course it isn't,
because it isn't everything.

01:53:58.165 --> 01:54:01.909
And we want everything,
don't we? Yeah.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:06.204
But we still have one thing,

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:09.419
one of our greatest things
we're gonna always have.

01:54:09.718 --> 01:54:11.960
You know what that is?

01:54:12.512 --> 01:54:14.799
Our dreams.

01:54:15.098 --> 01:54:18.262
We can still meet
in our dreams.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.643
We can talk
to each other there,

01:54:21.396 --> 01:54:25.686
and go for walks together in
the summer and in the winter

01:54:25.984 --> 01:54:28.567
and in the rain and the sun.

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:32.355
I can come and pick you up
and we can go flying.

01:54:36.828 --> 01:54:38.569
Nobody loves you like I do.

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:40.204
No.

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:43.075
Nobody ever will.

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:56.922
Hi, I brought you some tea.

01:54:57.224 --> 01:54:58.590
Oh, merry Christmas, baby.

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:01.054
Merry Christmas.

01:55:01.353 --> 01:55:02.594
Look what Mom made me.

01:55:02.896 --> 01:55:05.058
Wow!

01:55:05.357 --> 01:55:07.474
I'm gonna show Dad and Isabel.

01:55:07.776 --> 01:55:10.143
- Here.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:55:10.862 --> 01:55:12.273
Oh, Mom,

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:14.939
will you make sure Dad knows how
to double-knot my sneakers,

01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:18.110
the way you do for school
in the morning?

01:55:18.412 --> 01:55:19.994
Yes.

01:55:20.288 --> 01:55:22.075
Thanks.

01:55:25.293 --> 01:55:27.330
That's yours.

01:55:33.802 --> 01:55:35.464
Oh, wow!

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.337
- It's a quilt.
- Mm-hmm.

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.840
And it has our pictures on it.

01:55:40.058 --> 01:55:42.050
Here, put it here.

01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:45.187
Whoa.

01:55:46.314 --> 01:55:49.273
It's kind of like a scrapbook
you can keep warm with.

01:55:49.568 --> 01:55:52.857
It's so beautiful. I've
never seen anything like it.

01:55:53.155 --> 01:55:55.272
See your horse here and
your medals that you got.

01:55:56.116 --> 01:56:00.110
Remember this? That was that dress you
wouldn't take off in pre-K for three weeks.

01:56:00.412 --> 01:56:01.744
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

01:56:02.038 --> 01:56:04.872
Your first step.
Look at your foot.

01:56:05.542 --> 01:56:10.253
Look at that little chubby-cheeked thing.
Look at you.

01:56:14.176 --> 01:56:16.088
Are you scared?

01:56:17.137 --> 01:56:18.719
A little.

01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:21.718
Mostly I was scared for you,

01:56:22.017 --> 01:56:26.853
but I'm not anymore, because
I know you're gonna be okay.

01:56:29.649 --> 01:56:32.062
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:35.353
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:36.941
Oh, sweetie.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.606
Oh, my sweetie.

01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:40.696
It's okay.

01:56:40.994 --> 01:56:42.201
It's okay to miss me.

01:56:42.496 --> 01:56:44.203
It's okay.

01:56:45.081 --> 01:56:49.075
You can miss me and
you can take me with you.

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.920
You can.

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:55.082
I mean, when you're
in trouble, have me there.

01:56:55.383 --> 01:56:58.376
When you fall in love,
have me there.

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:00.089
You can.

01:57:00.388 --> 01:57:03.756
I mean, that's how... That's how
people go on forever, you know,

01:57:04.059 --> 01:57:06.893
because somebody
takes them along.

01:57:07.187 --> 01:57:09.053
Hmm? On your graduation

01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:13.726
and your wedding and when
you have your babies.

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:19.147
Take me along, will you?

01:57:19.991 --> 01:57:22.404
Always, always and always.

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:29.874
You have made my life

01:57:30.168 --> 01:57:32.034
so wonderful.

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:35.455
Take that with you, too, okay?

01:57:35.757 --> 01:57:37.293
Okay.

01:57:52.691 --> 01:57:56.105
Wow, Mom,
it's so cool!

01:57:56.403 --> 01:57:58.235
Let's see what
you got there, Ben.

01:57:58.530 --> 01:58:00.271
I don't know.

01:58:07.038 --> 01:58:09.746
What's the matter, honey?
You look a little disappointed.

01:58:10.041 --> 01:58:11.041
Huh?

01:58:11.126 --> 01:58:13.584
No. Everything's great, Mom.

01:58:13.878 --> 01:58:14.712
Uh-huh.

01:58:14.713 --> 01:58:16.045
I love my presents.

01:58:16.339 --> 01:58:20.549
Hey, guys, it looks
like we forgot one.

01:58:22.721 --> 01:58:25.088
It's got your name
on it, buddy.

01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:26.551
Abracadabra!

01:58:28.184 --> 01:58:29.766
What a beautiful cage.

01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:31.302
Yeah.

01:58:32.856 --> 01:58:34.438
It's empty.

01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:38.438
Well, let's try it again.

01:58:39.529 --> 01:58:43.569
I think maybe this time you
should say the magic words.

01:58:44.242 --> 01:58:46.609
Abracadabra!
Allakazam!

01:58:46.911 --> 01:58:49.574
Allakazoom!
Boom!

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.953
- Oh, my!
- It worked!

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:30.786
Why doesn't everybody get on
the sofa for a picture, huh?

01:59:31.081 --> 01:59:34.449
Baby, can you put that
birdcage on the floor for me?

01:59:37.962 --> 01:59:40.454
And I'll set up here.

01:59:44.928 --> 01:59:46.669
All right.
There you go.

01:59:46.971 --> 01:59:50.214
On the count of three, I want
to see big Christmas smiles.

01:59:50.517 --> 01:59:52.679
One, two...

01:59:53.478 --> 01:59:54.889
Benjamin.

01:59:55.188 --> 01:59:56.770
Three.

01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:59.102
Excellent.

01:59:59.401 --> 02:00:01.814
Good one. Okay, now let's get
one with the whole family.

02:00:02.112 --> 02:00:03.444
Isabel?

02:00:09.994 --> 02:00:14.079
Okay, let me just reset this.

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:18.210
