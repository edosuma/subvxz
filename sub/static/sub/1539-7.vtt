wants to talk.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.354
Tell falcone we'll talk.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.822
But not today.

11:30.824 --> 11:34.492
Don't be that way.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.362
"alive" is a very
broad category.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.631
A man with no hands

11:39.633 --> 11:41.199
Can still be alive.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.535
There are 50 cops in here.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.270
Try something.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.538
Everybody out.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.211
Please?!

12:08.127 --> 12:10.395
Go, boss.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.963
Get out of here.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.565
Jim...
Go.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.633
I can handle this.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.182
Well, how now, jim?

13:01.881 --> 13:04.282
(grunts)

13:09.855 --> 13:11.923
(panting)

13:40.019 --> 13:43.521
♪ ♪

14:01.574 --> 14:03.074
Jim?

14:03.076 --> 14:06.277
(whistles)

14:11.083 --> 14:12.750
Jim?

14:16.589 --> 14:19.958
Why are you hiding
from me, jim?

14:36.008 --> 14:37.075
Officer:
Hey!

14:37.077 --> 14:38.476
What the...?

14:40.646 --> 14:42.046
(screams)

14:46.051 --> 14:47.418
There!

14:54.393 --> 14:56.361
(tires screeching)

15:05.271 --> 15:06.804
You need a ride?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.746
Go, go, go, go, go!

15:25.724 --> 15:27.992
(groaning)

15:30.462 --> 15:32.230
No.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.733
No, please.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.614
Twenty-eight.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.553
(gasps, groans)

15:55.555 --> 15:57.789
(rats squeaking)

15:59.058 --> 16:01.526
Ah. You're back.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.228
How do you feel?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.597
Terrible.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.566
Where am I? Who are you?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
I'm a friend of
montoya and allen.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.070
I just took two bullets
out of you

16:12.072 --> 16:13.538
And sewed you up.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.206
Now I'm checking
to see how you're doing.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.240
So...

16:16.242 --> 16:18.710
Who are you,
what city are we in,

16:18.712 --> 16:20.478
And what day of
the week is it?

16:21.780 --> 16:23.314
I'm james gordon.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.716
We're in gotham.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.452
It's Friday.
Why are there rats?

16:27.454 --> 16:30.755
It's the dissection lab
at the university.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.258
I gather you're a fugitive
from the mob.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.561
Can't go to the
hospital, said crispus.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.230
Very exciting, I must say.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.432
How long have I been out?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.534
Just a couple of hours or so.
You're very lucky.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.304
No vital organs were...
Whoa, whoa, lie back down.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.705
Okay? You are hurt.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.374
Just a week or so in bed...

16:49.376 --> 16:50.641
No, I have to go.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.377
James, you have lost
a lot of blood.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.812
You have to do as I say
and lie back down.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.014
If you don't, you could die.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.815
I have to stand.
Can you help me?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.083
Okay, okay.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.351
Crispus?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.552
He said
he's leaving already.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.221
I have to go. Now.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.689
Sure.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.058
Some clothes would
be good though.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.332
This is about tradition, values.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.000
Snitches get stitches...

17:16.002 --> 17:17.268
That's how it's
always been.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.903
You need to hand him over, sal.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.171
I know.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.539
I should.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.241
But what can I say?

17:23.242 --> 17:26.077
The little guy amuses me.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.346
Don falcone is going to be
very unhappy.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.848
You want to start a war
over this punk?

17:30.850 --> 17:31.916
War?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.785
Whoa.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.720
He's that important
to you, is he?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.688
Oh, no.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.223
He means nothing to us.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.193
Respect is what matters here.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.929
Respect I understand.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.264
Penguin!

17:46.266 --> 17:48.332
Come on out here.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.170
Don't be scared. She won't bite.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.504
You won't bite him, will you?

18:00.479 --> 18:02.146
Hello, penguin.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.749
Hello, ms. Mooney.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.819
Maroni: Penguin,
ms. Mooney and her boss,

18:07.821 --> 18:12.023
Mr. Falcone,
feel disrespected by you.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.391
Oh, dear.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.227
Well, that certainly
has never been my intention.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.996
Maroni: Well, respect is
very important to them.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.999
Now, I want a sincere apology
from you

18:22.001 --> 18:23.601
For making them feel that way.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.404
Oh, gosh, of course.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.473
If I've in any way

18:28.475 --> 18:30.775
Caused anyone to feel
a lack of respect,

18:30.777 --> 18:32.410
I apologize.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.679
Sincerely.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.414
Maroni:
There you go.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.449
Can't say
fairer than that.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.922
Bloodshed, then.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.991
I'm glad.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.227
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.030
And you...

18:53.032 --> 18:55.666
You little

18:55.668 --> 18:59.303
Scaly-faced bitch.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.972
(inhales sharply)

19:00.974 --> 19:04.475
Oh... What I'm gonna do to you.

19:06.411 --> 19:10.781
"torture" is far too nice
of a word.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.018
I'm sorry you feel
that way, fish...

19:14.020 --> 19:15.353
(grunts)

19:21.527 --> 19:26.063
Only my friends... Call me fish.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.740
(laughing)

19:40.913 --> 19:42.980
(church bell tolling)

19:55.093 --> 19:56.827
Hey, sisters!

19:58.530 --> 19:59.597
How's it hanging?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.076
Holy...!

20:12.078 --> 20:13.744
(horn blaring)

20:13.746 --> 20:16.247
(women screaming)

20:16.249 --> 20:18.482
(tires screeching)

20:27.759 --> 20:29.460
Tell your boss
falcone won't let

20:29.462 --> 20:31.362
Any of maroni's trucks
over the bridge.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.697
Not till he
gives up penguin.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.899
So, listen, you got
to get hurt a little.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.634
You want a beating or a bullet?

20:36.636 --> 20:37.969
Why we got to get hurt?

20:37.971 --> 20:40.771
Because we're sending a message
this is a serious issue.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.607
We'll tell him it's serious.
No problem.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.208
Ah, you know what?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.377
(men screaming)

20:49.348 --> 20:52.350
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?!

20:52.352 --> 20:54.819
That's $3 mil per
week right there!

20:54.821 --> 20:56.721
Son of a bitch!

20:56.723 --> 20:58.723
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.291
Very aggressive move,
isn't it?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.159
An overreaction.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.527
They want to scare you.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.196
Oh, is that right?
You think that they think

21:05.198 --> 21:06.330
That don maroni can be scared?

21:06.332 --> 21:08.532
Of course, you're right. No.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.369
But why, then, would they
react so ferociously?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.870
Why do they want me
back so badly?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.138
I know why.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.973
Because they know I got

21:15.975 --> 21:17.408
A stone moneymaker here.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.010
A golden goose.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.345
They know it, and they
don't want us to have him.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.347
Right, penguin?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.181
Honk, honk.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.750
(chuckles)

21:26.585 --> 21:27.885
What?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.487
Honk, honk.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.088
It's what geese say.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.256
(laughs):
Oh, right, right.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.491
Honk, honk.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.426
So, fine, he's a goose.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.428
Maybe we can negotiate a price,

21:37.430 --> 21:39.330
Pay them off.
Yeah.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.464
Yes.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.266
Caution is wise.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.136
The falcone clan still is
number one, after all.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.305
Paying them off is
the safe thing to do.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.839
Screw safe.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.275
They want to push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?

21:51.277 --> 21:52.843
I'll push right
back, harder.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.846
Hit them where
it hurts. Today.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.281
You know best.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.417
If that's how you want
to play it,

21:59.419 --> 22:02.553
I think I know
just the spot to hit them.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.230
Montoya:
I owe you an apology.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.233
You were telling the truth,
and I wouldn't believe you.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.802
Maybe my personal feelings
towards barbara

22:17.804 --> 22:19.103
Got tangled up in there.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.304
And that was wrong.

22:20.306 --> 22:21.539
Forget it.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.307
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry
for misjudging you,

22:23.309 --> 22:26.010
And I'm very glad
that we're on the same side now.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.783
Yeah, me, too.

22:34.152 --> 22:35.820
So barbara's safe though?

22:35.822 --> 22:37.455
You're sure she's safe?

22:37.457 --> 22:40.524
I'm sure.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.528
(allen groans)

22:44.530 --> 22:46.230
Gordon, is that you?!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.300
It's all right, alfred.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.701
It's all right. He's a friend.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.969
We couldn't risk
a direct approach;

22:51.971 --> 22:53.137
There's people looking for me.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.172
Ah, right.
(groans)

22:55.174 --> 22:57.408
Sorry about that, mate.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.210
Can't be too careful.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.581
In a spot of bother,
are we, sir?

23:05.150 --> 23:08.152
Gordon: Renee montoya
and crispus allen.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.422
Pleased to meet you.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.558
Bruce, I promised I would find
your parents' killer.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.328
I'm not sure I'm going to be
able to keep that promise.

23:17.330 --> 23:20.331
It's a long story, but I'm
kind of in a tight spot.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.266
I've upset some powerful people.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.268
Stop treating me like a child.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.405
Explain.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.606
Bruce, you are a child.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.774
You don't need to know...

23:29.776 --> 23:30.941
You expect to die!

23:32.444 --> 23:34.145
I'd like to know why.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.349
Is it connected
to my parents' murder?

23:38.351 --> 23:41.085
Yes, it's all connected.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.488
Somehow.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.324
Bruce...

23:47.326 --> 23:49.794
I will do my best
to work this thing out.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.328
But if I don't,

23:51.330 --> 23:55.199
Montoya and allen here will
take over your parents' case.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.534
I've told them
everything I know.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.702
You can trust them,
one hundred percent.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.104
One hundred percent.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.278
Bruce, these are
good detectives.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.448
If anyone can find
the truth, it's them.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.390
Thank you.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.060
Sir, what can we do
to help you now?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.728
Nothing.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.831
From here on in,
I have to go it alone.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.666
I don't want anyone
else caught up in this.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.634
I have to go.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.036
You can hardly walk.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.905
I'll be fine.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.428
(men chattering in russian,
laughter)

25:05.504 --> 25:08.005
This way.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.542
Not much further.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.750
It's there.

25:31.596 --> 25:34.164
(chatter continues)

25:39.104 --> 25:41.171
(men screaming)

25:47.846 --> 25:49.613
(gunfire stops)

25:54.052 --> 25:56.587
Oswald:
Told you.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.422
Easy as pie.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.558
There must be a million
dollars' worth here.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.094
Yeah, you told us, all right.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.096
You're clever.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.799
You're very clever.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.702
I sense a sarcastic
and hostile edge to your tone.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.970
Hostile?

26:14.105 --> 26:15.606
You got that right.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.976
You ain't no golden goose,
you're a yellow rat snitch,

26:18.978 --> 26:21.245
And you got maroni
all twisted.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.281
I'm so glad we're finally
clearing the air at last.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.783
That's it.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.585
Act smart, okay?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.787
'cause all I got
to do right now

26:29.789 --> 26:32.222
Is put a bullet in
your brain right here.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.724
Bang.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.759
See, then I go back
and I tell the boss

26:35.761 --> 26:37.227
That one of niko's
men shot you.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.696
Gee, that's too bad.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.030
End of story.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.566
(chuckles)

26:42.568 --> 26:45.202
Yes, that's clever enough.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.505
I never doubted
your intelligence.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.974
That's not your problem.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.043
Oh, I got a problem, huh?
I got a problem.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.845
No, you got a problem.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.146
What's my problem, schmo?

26:56.148 --> 26:58.082
What drives you?

26:58.084 --> 27:00.484
What's your passion?

27:00.486 --> 27:04.054
When you know what a man loves,

27:04.056 --> 27:06.357
You know what can kill him.

27:06.359 --> 27:09.059
Do you believe this guy?

27:09.061 --> 27:11.195
For you, it's money.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.030
You love money.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.367
More than power
and respect.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.236
You're a skinflint, mr. Carbone.

27:21.039 --> 27:23.107
A cheapskate.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.177
What are you guys playing at?
Let me go!

27:27.179 --> 27:28.846
Sorry, frankie.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.582
As I say, a cheapskate.
Carbone: Hey, come on!

27:31.584 --> 27:33.550
Hey...
Consequently,

27:33.552 --> 27:35.686
You don't pay
your people enough.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.688
No, you know me.
You don't want to do this.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.924
It is a sad fact...
You don't want
to do this.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.693
No. No. No, no!

27:42.695 --> 27:44.728
...That there is no loyalty
among thieves.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.499
(grunts)

27:48.501 --> 27:49.700
(groaning)

27:49.702 --> 27:52.536
The simple offer
of a substantial pay raise

27:52.538 --> 27:55.372
Is all it took to sway
these fine men.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.975
(screaming)

27:57.977 --> 28:01.178
So, you see,
<i>that's</i> your problem!

28:01.180 --> 28:03.347
Your greatest passion

28:03.349 --> 28:06.216
Becomes your greatest weakness!

28:09.354 --> 28:11.422
(chuckling)

28:16.294 --> 28:19.663
Love, mr. Carbone.

28:19.665 --> 28:22.299
(chuckles)

28:22.301 --> 28:24.368
Love conquers all.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.939
Shh.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.394
My friend.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.664
My good friend,
today is a sad day.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.133
Nikolai was
like a son to me,

28:56.135 --> 28:58.902
Just as frankie
was a son to you.

28:58.904 --> 29:02.072
We've both lost
precious family members.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.074
My condolences to you.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.909
And mine to you.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.845
I want this violence to stop.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.346
Business is good.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.615
The arkham project
is a gold mine.

29:11.617 --> 29:14.251
Wayne enterprises
is back in play.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.819
Life is good
for all of us.

29:15.821 --> 29:19.690
Why risk all of that
and go to war over trifles?

29:19.692 --> 29:24.294
Your little man there is
obviously very valuable to you.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.029
We'll let you have him.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.264
Unharmed.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.666
Our gift to you.

29:29.668 --> 29:31.335
And as a show of

29:31.337 --> 29:34.772
Mutual respect,
you give us something in return.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.641
Like such as what?

29:37.643 --> 29:40.010
How about real estate?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.880
One of your warehouses
on the river maybe.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.782
That's not gonna work.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.183
I mean, I like this fella,

29:46.185 --> 29:50.020
But we're talking about
a warehouse on the river.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.293
Maroni:
Yeah.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.495
Indian hill.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.898
I'll give you
indian hill.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.400
I'm not familiar with the name.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.835
It's in arkham.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.570
It's a toxic waste dump

30:06.572 --> 30:08.539
On top of
an indian burial ground.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.073
It's worthless.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.542
Falcone:
No.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.911
Nothing is worthless.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.512
Even nothing is
worth something.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.814
We'll take it.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.817
As a token of
our mutual respect, yes?

30:19.819 --> 30:21.652
You got it, my friend.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.288
It's all love.

30:27.091 --> 30:28.625
It's a pleasure
seeing you all.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.397
Um, I heard vic zsasz
tore up the gcpd,

30:33.399 --> 30:34.998
Tracking down gordon.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.767
Did you catch him yet?

30:36.769 --> 30:38.769
We're working on it.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.404
Well, good luck
with that.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.407
There's nothing more dangerous
than an honest man, huh?

31:07.165 --> 31:08.498
(knocking)

31:08.500 --> 31:10.334
Bullock: Jimbo,
it's me. Open up.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.069
(knocking)

31:13.037 --> 31:14.438
Hey.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.206
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna kill you.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.208
I should, but I ain't.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.943
Glad to hear it.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.546
Obviously, you figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look,

31:22.548 --> 31:24.214
Because it'd be
the first place they'd reject

31:24.216 --> 31:25.282
As being too obvious.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.885
I-I'm sorry,
I'm being rude.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.987
This is the duchess
of devonshire.
(laughs)

31:29.989 --> 31:32.256
Duchess, jim gordon, putz.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.390
Marsha. Hi.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.225
Right.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.793
Baby, why don't you
explore a little bit.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.829
Find the bedroom,
put on your birthday suit.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.030
(laughs)

31:40.032 --> 31:43.867
And I'll find you
in a jiffy, okay? Hmm?

31:43.869 --> 31:45.569
So I've been thinking.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.271
You're still
a douche bag.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.772
But you have
the moral high ground.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.073
So I'm gonna back your play,

31:50.075 --> 31:51.075
Whatever it is.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.643
I figure
I'm doomed anyhow.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.811
I might as well join
the good guys.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.580
Thank you.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.814
So what is your play?

31:57.816 --> 31:59.549
I mean, you got one, right?
You said you did.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.152
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting
falcone and the mayor

32:02.154 --> 32:04.621
For the framing
of mario pepper.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.291
Conspiracy, poj,
rico, the works.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.660
Well, that's a...
That's a hell of a plan.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.061
You sit down with
a panel of chimpanzees

32:11.063 --> 32:13.563
And a bucket of crack
and come up with that one?

32:13.565 --> 32:16.066
I figure whatever else happens,
we'll stir things up.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.467
We might even make the papers.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.002
Oh, yeah, we're gonna make
the papers, all right.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.604
We're gonna be dead
in the streets

32:20.606 --> 32:22.406
In time for the evening edition.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.174
Well, at least the people
will know the truth.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.809
And we'll go out
doing our jobs,

32:25.811 --> 32:27.110
Enforcing the law.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.012
That's the best
inspirational speech you got?

32:29.014 --> 32:30.580
Doing our jobs?

32:30.582 --> 32:31.848
You don't have to join me.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.050
No, I'm game.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.818
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.721
Now, if you'll excuse me
for one minute,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.390
Just gonna take care
of some business.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.792
Duchess!

32:43.594 --> 32:45.529
Marco!

32:45.531 --> 32:47.464
Marsha:
Polo!

33:03.881 --> 33:05.349
Jumping catfish.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.050
Good morning,
mayor james.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.385
Gordon, you scared...

33:08.387 --> 33:09.920
Scared the bejeebers
out of me.

33:09.922 --> 33:11.355
Almost spilled
my coffee.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.589
Sorry.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.857
Sir, you're
under arrest.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.192
That's not funny.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.627
Depends where you're sitting.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.465
Might want to take
a look at this.

33:32.877 --> 33:34.978
How you doing, guys?

33:34.980 --> 33:36.980
I'm here to have a chat
with mr. Falcone.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.982
Sure thing, mr. Mayor.

33:50.661 --> 33:54.231
(door opens, closes)

34:01.039 --> 34:03.740
Carmine falcone,
you're under arrest.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.276
Bullock:
Move.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.880
Lie down right over there.
Stay quiet.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.181
What on earth are you thinking?

34:12.184 --> 34:13.750
We're thinking
we'll take you both to jail

34:13.752 --> 34:15.719
And charge you with conspiracy

34:15.721 --> 34:17.920
To pervert the course
of justice.
Try and take me in,

34:17.922 --> 34:19.755
You won't make it
to the end of the street.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.591
That's exactly what I said.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.960
This is a lawful arrest.
If you resist, you will be shot.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.362
I see.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.197
We all die together
in a blaze of glory.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.833
If that's how it works out,
that's fine with me.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.101
How about you, harvey?

34:31.103 --> 34:32.436
Fine by me.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.603
Oh, god.
Falcone:
I envy you boys.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.340
Having nothing to lose
must be liberating.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.975
Must feel pretty good.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.444
Yes, it does.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.478
Suppose you did have
something to lose.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
What would you do then?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.181
Suppose,
for instance,

34:44.183 --> 34:47.684
I had a knife to barbara kean's
throat right now.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.386
Would you still
be so brave?

34:49.388 --> 34:50.454
You don't.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.955
I'm telling you I do.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.290
You're a liar.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.558
I have many faults,

34:54.560 --> 34:56.893
But I'm not a liar.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.196
Victor zsasz has barbara.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.931
You know victor.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.401
You're lying. She's far away.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.969
She came back.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.338
Came right to me
to plead for your life.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.474
You have a good
woman there.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.542
She loves you
very much.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.411
Too much.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.415
Prove it.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.883
Prove you have her.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.685
I could.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.453
But I won't.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.022
I want you to believe me.

35:27.425 --> 35:28.658
It's obvious, jim. He's lying.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.393
Am I?

35:30.395 --> 35:32.596
If you think so,

35:32.598 --> 35:35.132
Go ahead and try to bring me in.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.733
You'll be dead,

35:36.735 --> 35:39.436
So you won't know what
happens to barbara.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.304
But it won't be pretty.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.506
Lying.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.941
On my mother's grave.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.244
Drop your gun,

35:47.246 --> 35:49.713
And barbara won't be
harmed in any way.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.453
Those muffins
smell good.

35:56.455 --> 35:59.256
None for you, creep.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.058
She can have one
if she wants.

36:02.060 --> 36:05.262
No, thank you.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.164
(ringtone playing)

36:19.977 --> 36:21.511
Got it.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.419
What a shame.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.790
Oh, this is embarrassing;
he straight-up

36:33.792 --> 36:35.559
Bluffed you into folding.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.761
We could've gone out like
heroes; now we're fish food.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.633
Okay, so it
wasn't a bluff.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.069
Falcone:
I'm sorry if she was

36:46.071 --> 36:47.737
Mistreated a little.
We needed to be

36:47.739 --> 36:50.040
Sure she had nothing
useful to tell us.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.341
Untie her, victor.

36:53.811 --> 36:55.078
I'm sorry.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.815
What am I gonna do with you?

36:58.817 --> 37:01.718
By rights, you
have to die.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.020
Whoa, hello.
Uh, I'm late for work.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.490
Quite an adventure.
I'll be on my way.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.126
Falcone:
Such a waste though.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.562
Gotham needs men like you,
both of you.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.965
Strong men
with principles.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.299
I wish I could
make you see

37:16.301 --> 37:17.934
I'm not the enemy.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.769
The system is
not the enemy.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.938
The enemy is anarchy.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.075
But I told you that
before, didn't I, jim?

37:25.077 --> 37:26.543
Yes, you did.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.812
You didn't listen though.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.848
Do we get a last meal or a smoke
or anything, or just talk?

37:31.850 --> 37:34.217
Falcone: But today,
you believed me.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.152
You trusted my word.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.922
That's a good first step.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.824
Perhaps there's still
hope for you.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.532
Yes.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.002
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.837
Wait a minute.
Quiet.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.542
It's been a
pleasure, barbara.

37:59.544 --> 38:02.012
I do admire
a brave woman.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.315
What's the catch?

38:05.317 --> 38:07.083
Jim, he said we could go.
Let's not haggle here.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.919
What's the catch, mr. Falcone?

38:09.921 --> 38:12.756
I want you to think
about what I said.

38:12.758 --> 38:16.393
I want you to
understand the truth.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.794
That's all I ask.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.330
The catch is...

38:20.332 --> 38:23.033
Someday soon,
you'll see I'm right.

38:41.519 --> 38:42.952
Barbara...

38:42.954 --> 38:44.954
I'm sorry.

38:44.956 --> 38:48.792
I was just trying
to help, and...

38:48.794 --> 38:51.027
I don't know what...

38:56.834 --> 38:58.301
I love you so much.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.138
(thunder rumbling)

39:15.252 --> 39:16.519
Mmm.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.821
Excellent.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.089
Delicious!

39:19.091 --> 39:20.357
Yes.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.925
I followed the recipe.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.893
You're right, mr. F.,
cooking is easy.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.264
I'm sorry you had
to see all that earlier.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.433
Not pleasant.

39:30.435 --> 39:31.901
I understand.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.236
Business is business.

39:33.238 --> 39:34.471
Mm-hmm.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.940
Yes, it is.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.676
I'll go see to
the chickens.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.581
(chickens clucking)

39:44.583 --> 39:46.616
(falcone clucking)

39:46.618 --> 39:48.685
Any eggs, my dears?

39:59.463 --> 40:00.764
Don falcone.

40:06.036 --> 40:07.470
My friend.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.105
Good to see you.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.607
I was just thinking

40:10.609 --> 40:12.642
About the night
we met.

40:17.314 --> 40:20.183
Cut them down.

40:22.386 --> 40:23.553
Where's the snitch?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.388
I want to
speak to him.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.462
Cobblepot, is it?

40:35.499 --> 40:38.568
Condemned men are
honest men, I find.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.371
What can you tell me
before you go?

40:48.379 --> 40:49.712
Don falcone.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.815
It is a great
honor, sir.

40:51.817 --> 40:56.519
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...

40:56.521 --> 40:58.822
If you grant me
one last request.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.657
Which is what?

41:00.659 --> 41:02.192
(sniffles)

41:02.194 --> 41:04.527
Give the job of killing me
to james gordon.

41:04.529 --> 41:07.030
Why him?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.065
He's the only man
under your sway

41:09.067 --> 41:10.500
Who has a conscience.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.368
The only one
who might be persuaded

41:12.370 --> 41:13.570
To spare my life.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.039
Why would I agree to that?

41:16.041 --> 41:17.907
I want you dead.
You're a snitch.

41:19.343 --> 41:23.246
If you agree
and gordon spares me,

41:23.248 --> 41:25.114
Then I will become <i> your</i> snitch.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.517
For life.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.487
I will come back to gotham
under a different name,

41:30.489 --> 41:32.755
And I will work my way
into the maroni family,

41:32.757 --> 41:34.290
And I will snitch for you.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.993
I am excellent at
this sort of work.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.628
I have a gift for it.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.997
I really do, sir.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.178
Deal.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.081
Gordon will get the
job of killing you.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.951
Thank you, sir.

42:01.953 --> 42:05.855
What is the valuable secret?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.992
Oh, yes.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.493
Fish mooney
and nikolai the russian

42:10.495 --> 42:13.196
Only pretend to hate each other.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.664
They're lovers.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.033
And fish is
pushing nikolai

42:17.035 --> 42:19.102
To take your place.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.539
Is that so?

42:22.541 --> 42:23.773
Yes, sir.

42:23.775 --> 42:27.110
But only so fish
can take over from him.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.449
That is a good secret.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.587
It's almost uncanny.

42:37.589 --> 42:40.924
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.560
We got rid of
nikolai painlessly,

42:43.562 --> 42:45.828
And maroni thinks
you're a wizard.

42:45.830 --> 42:49.165
You really do
have a gift.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.900
But I think we're
making a mistake

42:50.902 --> 42:52.835
Letting gordon live.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.337
He's trouble.

42:54.339 --> 42:58.107
Thank you so much
for sparing him.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.809
I appreciate the favor.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.277
(thunder rumbling softly)

43:01.279 --> 43:02.979
Don't worry.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.781
He'll see the light.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.015
One way or another.

43:06.017 --> 43:08.084
I guarantee it.
