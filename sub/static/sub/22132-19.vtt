are you sure you sorry yeah no I'm not

03:31.949 --> 03:35.519
sure but you know how can water plays
tricks on you think you can see my shoes

03:35.520 --> 03:38.520
on the water like shoulda stayed on the
beach

03:46.729 --> 03:50.149
what happened uh the clapping she's part
of it

03:50.150 --> 03:51.450
what clock

03:51.449 --> 03:54.449
come on my gosh she's wrapped up in it

03:55.080 --> 04:01.110
Jason kind of painting this morning
whitish kind of see Jewish 0 the current

04:01.110 --> 04:02.580
like my grandma's house

04:02.580 --> 04:06.239
I just got a call from ems she to make
it

04:07.080 --> 04:09.819
yeah

04:09.818 --> 04:11.409
god bless you made it

04:11.409 --> 04:14.409
sorry

04:45.269 --> 04:57.930
step my interval stink my stroke is
collapsed haven't been paying attention

04:57.930 --> 05:01.230
and all of a sudden I only have 10 days
before the xterra triathlon

05:01.829 --> 05:03.870
you think I'm not with the time you

05:03.870 --> 05:08.430
right che how did better than you think
being in shape is not like being in race

05:08.430 --> 05:11.670
shape though and I didn't want to do
well I wanted to win

05:11.670 --> 05:18.870
can I help you know thanks for the offer
but I hate seeing you so disappointed

05:19.649 --> 05:22.979
now you're not the only one what about
my sponsor Valley total fitness

05:22.980 --> 05:26.490
we may have been doing so much to help
me and I would hate to disappoint them

05:26.490 --> 05:28.949
with a poor showing you have to do it

05:28.949 --> 05:33.089
yeah I've already committed look I'm
just gonna have to go over there and get

05:33.089 --> 05:36.089
my foot which

05:38.740 --> 05:41.740
thanks for standing by no problem

05:42.399 --> 05:45.939
Sean I need a favor big time

05:45.939 --> 05:49.418
what is it I want to take a leave of
absence

05:49.418 --> 05:53.529
I don't think that's such a good idea
right now ten days just until after the

05:53.529 --> 05:54.489
maui race

05:54.490 --> 05:58.509
Jesse this isn't a summer gig you can't
come and go with every race I know that

05:58.509 --> 06:02.650
I've dreamt about winning a triathlon
for my entire life it's the reason I

06:02.649 --> 06:04.388
came to Hawaii in the first place

06:04.389 --> 06:08.710
I'm committed to compete I thought you
were committed to this team

06:08.709 --> 06:12.069
I am but this race is important and I
need time to Train

06:12.699 --> 06:15.699
goodbye and good luck

06:18.069 --> 06:20.019
that's horrible

06:20.019 --> 06:23.149
because you know how much this team
means to me

06:23.149 --> 06:26.149
and what about putting your personal
needs in front of this team and leaving

06:26.149 --> 06:29.149
this team short a person in that
horrible -

06:39.740 --> 06:45.168
son I have an idea about Jesse let me
work with her gone out of everyone I

06:45.168 --> 06:47.930
thought that you would understand why I
did what I just did

06:47.930 --> 06:51.740
I would love to suggest you run that
race hell I think with her ability she

06:51.740 --> 06:56.300
could do great and it kills me to see
the disappointment in her eyes look at

06:56.300 --> 06:59.990
what it will do to this team and we're
all making sacrifices here with our

06:59.990 --> 07:05.150
personal time and are our goals not
gonna let the fabric break down now

07:05.149 --> 07:11.029
what about Jesse what do you mean her
spirits just she's tough she'll think

07:11.029 --> 07:14.568
this through and in the end you'll see
that I was right on the main reason

07:14.569 --> 07:17.449
which wanted me here was to improve the
physical ability of the team

07:17.449 --> 07:21.379
ok here's your chance with Jesse she's
motivated

07:21.379 --> 07:24.529
let me see how much better I can make
her all part of team training

07:26.300 --> 07:29.840
all right fine do it make her better
make us all better but she is not

07:29.839 --> 07:32.839
running in that race we don't need that
kind of distraction

07:34.959 --> 07:37.579
yeah

07:37.579 --> 07:38.848
yeah

07:38.848 --> 07:41.848
yeah

07:48.449 --> 07:53.848
it's not your truck that's coming into
your time what reason your intervals are

07:53.848 --> 07:57.449
off it's not because your stroke and you
know all about it

07:57.449 --> 08:04.199
it's my field it's what I do and I do it
well you're right it's not my stroke my

08:04.199 --> 08:05.550
concentration

08:05.550 --> 08:09.028
I just can't seem to focus there are too
many distractions

08:09.028 --> 08:12.749
well the training you've been doing with
the team has been pretty intense but not

08:12.749 --> 08:14.789
designed towards building to a peek

08:14.788 --> 08:18.628
you need to restructure everything
you're doing and any more road work

08:18.629 --> 08:22.650
it doesn't matter if I racing off the
team there's no chance that Sean's gonna

08:22.649 --> 08:24.209
change his mind

08:24.209 --> 08:28.680
I talked to Sean so if there was no
chance would I be here talking to you

08:28.680 --> 08:32.038
he knows you do wow that's a surprise

08:32.788 --> 08:36.328
maybe I can just suck it up and try
harder

08:36.328 --> 08:40.977
how much time do you have 10 days till
the race Jesse over training is not the

08:40.979 --> 08:45.600
answer is how you train and how do you
suggest i trained well there's this new

08:45.600 --> 08:49.079
thing now called the computer maybe
you've heard of it sounds familiar

08:49.078 --> 08:53.189
will measure you and run some tests to
show what just put yourself in my hands

08:53.190 --> 08:55.079
get you where you need to be

08:55.078 --> 08:58.318
sounds like a nice offer yes it does
doesn't it

08:59.730 --> 09:03.930
so why the charity all of a sudden
you're just an excuse for me to do what

09:03.929 --> 09:04.708
I do

09:04.708 --> 09:08.099
Sean skeptically doesn't think I can do
it or maybe he doesn't think you can do

09:08.100 --> 09:12.060
it but I know I can improve your
performance so dramatically when shawn

09:12.059 --> 09:15.059
says I can do that I can do it with the
others

09:16.200 --> 09:18.740
ok

09:18.740 --> 09:20.329
let's do it

09:20.328 --> 09:23.328
yeah

09:25.938 --> 09:28.938
hey Jason

09:30.409 --> 09:33.409
familiar

09:34.139 --> 09:37.919
this is a model named ki Hong bikini she
was garden

09:38.480 --> 09:43.278
Obama cool yeah , close the ancient
rulers from what the legend says that

09:43.278 --> 09:47.570
she would travel the islands and your
evil people into the water and then if I

09:47.570 --> 09:49.260
book

09:49.259 --> 09:55.259
wait wait wait let me that's right so do
you think that i saw ki halloween

09:55.259 --> 10:00.299
mhm and you think the mall this up
lizard in the woman's form killed the

10:00.299 --> 10:00.779
girl

10:00.779 --> 10:04.199
Oh Jason just so you know she had just
been tried for murder

10:04.200 --> 10:07.200
she was just released for insufficient
evidence

10:07.200 --> 10:09.778
you're talking like a crazy person

10:09.778 --> 10:13.470
Jason I'm telling you you saw me how we
hanging I mean just look anything like

10:13.470 --> 10:16.470
this

10:19.889 --> 10:22.889
there's something the matter I'll tell
you suffered

10:23.649 --> 10:28.389
don't believe everyone wives tale you
here Paul Bunyan tooth fairies don't

10:28.389 --> 10:33.009
believe in hershey no i don't but
anyways I didn't see her and you did so

10:33.009 --> 10:34.800
only

10:34.799 --> 10:37.799
you know

10:48.759 --> 10:50.289
yeah

10:50.289 --> 10:55.750
now why when I heard you're going to try
and Jesse didn't I think to myself

10:56.289 --> 10:59.769
yeah it was always the first to lend a
helping hand and she's such a great

10:59.769 --> 11:04.089
power of Jesse's why did I think what
has she got up their slave

11:04.089 --> 11:08.680
I don't know perhaps you're a natural
Senate or maybe have difficulty with

11:08.679 --> 11:14.169
strong women or maybe your mother was
scared by a kangaroo i don't care i

11:14.169 --> 11:17.289
don't like people in my face about was
basically none of their business

11:17.289 --> 11:20.559
well I know how much this race means to
jesse and if you spoil it for her

11:20.559 --> 11:24.219
it'll rip her guts out I do we'll deal
with it won't we

11:24.220 --> 11:30.310
you can count on it hey Jess hey Allie
and I stayed on

11:30.309 --> 11:33.429
very good

11:33.429 --> 11:36.429
I mostly believed you meant it

11:37.509 --> 11:39.250
it's getting up

11:39.250 --> 11:42.759
Ali thinks i'm going to ruin your dream
destroy your chances and live your life

11:42.759 --> 11:44.200
and spirit and tatters

11:44.200 --> 11:47.200
don't forget to fasten your seat belt

11:48.879 --> 11:51.939
yeah

12:57.710 --> 13:00.470
yeah

13:00.470 --> 13:03.470
yeah

13:11.750 --> 13:14.750
yeah

13:29.500 --> 13:32.500
yeah

13:34.019 --> 13:36.720
yeah

13:36.720 --> 13:40.160
yeah

13:40.159 --> 13:50.059
yeah

13:51.528 --> 13:54.528
yeah

13:59.789 --> 14:04.649
yeah

14:05.580 --> 14:09.570
sharp

14:09.570 --> 14:13.470
yeah you lived on this island longer
knife

14:13.470 --> 14:16.470
what do you think about all these myths
and stories

14:17.279 --> 14:20.939
well I can tell you my favorite one is
the one about not cutting your hair at

14:20.940 --> 14:23.790
night cutting your hair and that's bad

14:23.789 --> 14:28.799
oh yeah the lizard will steal your soul
or the one about the woman in all white

14:28.799 --> 14:30.509
with all white dog

14:30.509 --> 14:34.019
now if you see you're on the road you're
supposed to pick her up and you believe

14:34.019 --> 14:35.159
this stuff

14:35.159 --> 14:39.539
Polynesians had no written language so
the way they kept their history was

14:39.539 --> 14:43.649
through stories that were passed on from
generation to generation sometimes these

14:43.649 --> 14:47.370
stories got a little village at this
number is small right but it always

14:47.370 --> 14:49.019
starts finish

14:49.019 --> 14:52.980
every Hawaiian myth began with you know
some sort of truth

14:52.980 --> 14:56.279
so you believe the stuff

14:56.279 --> 14:59.279
well I put it to you like this I don't
not

15:02.299 --> 15:11.809
yeah

15:11.809 --> 15:14.809
yeah

15:18.190 --> 15:24.670
the computer will read these points and
generate an image of you as a structure

15:24.669 --> 15:29.229
points and axis fulcrums and hinges
levers

15:29.230 --> 15:32.740
it's not like an engineering project
well that's exactly what the body is a

15:32.740 --> 15:33.909
complex machine

15:33.909 --> 15:36.909
all right

15:43.440 --> 15:45.100
yeah

15:45.100 --> 15:49.990
so what's happening you're being
measured the longer the leg the longer

15:49.990 --> 15:50.830
the step

15:50.830 --> 15:55.270
it's that simple you can practice all
day maximize with the leg can do but you

15:55.269 --> 15:59.079
can never change the physics computer
will tell us what your body is capable

15:59.080 --> 16:01.629
of and we will work towards it

16:01.629 --> 16:05.350
so you just want me to keep going back
and forth right

16:05.350 --> 16:08.350
ok now face towards me stretch your arms
bend down

16:09.730 --> 16:12.730
keep going yeah

16:14.639 --> 16:17.639
yeah

16:23.990 --> 16:29.028
we need to find out how you burn oxygen
how fast your heart delivers blood to

16:29.028 --> 16:32.450
your muscles and how hard you can work
your muscles before they become deprived

16:32.450 --> 16:37.520
of oxygen in the blood equals energy how
efficiently you use energy will tell us

16:37.519 --> 16:39.919
whether you're a sprinter or a long
distance runner

16:39.919 --> 16:42.919
pick up the pace

16:44.179 --> 16:47.289
yeah

16:47.289 --> 16:50.439
your reaction time your bone density and
body fat

16:50.440 --> 16:53.320
when we have all these numbers the
computer will tell us what your body can

16:53.320 --> 16:56.320
do it faster

17:00.419 --> 17:04.019
wait

17:04.700 --> 17:08.420
the wages where

17:09.838 --> 17:16.549
yeah

17:16.549 --> 17:19.549
yeah

17:50.940 --> 17:54.570
that's how to do

17:54.569 --> 18:00.299
you're in great shape I like that you're
in the top range of all the categories

18:00.299 --> 18:06.299
pretty much maxed out your potential but
you can't win a triathlon

18:07.170 --> 18:11.759
you won't even finish in the top ten but
it's the bike race

18:12.509 --> 18:16.109
he's never say you cannot be competitive
in the bike race look I know the bikes

18:16.109 --> 18:19.379
not my best event but Jesse the
triathlon is an endurance contest

18:20.190 --> 18:23.789
so your numbers have to match these
numbers I don't need you to tell me what

18:23.789 --> 18:25.889
the iron man is I eat sleep and dream it

18:25.890 --> 18:29.400
look you're not listening to what I'm
saying to you hear the numbers say that

18:29.400 --> 18:30.720
you are a fabulous swimmer

18:30.720 --> 18:33.779
I think that you would win that leg of
the contest right now

18:33.779 --> 18:36.869
so you start out ahead but by the end of
the bike race

18:36.869 --> 18:40.859
you'd be back in the pack too far back
what about the run

18:40.859 --> 18:45.000
it doesn't matter that you can run you'd
be too far back to catch up

18:45.000 --> 18:49.980
well then we'll just build up my biking
skills you can lift weights all day and

18:49.980 --> 18:53.849
never look like Arnold Schwarzenegger
you could pedal till the day you die and

18:53.849 --> 18:55.439
you'll never be world class

18:55.440 --> 18:58.559
you can try as hard as you want but
you'll never win a race that includes

18:58.559 --> 19:01.778
biking

19:01.778 --> 19:04.990
sorry

19:04.990 --> 19:06.299
sometimes

19:06.299 --> 19:09.299
that's the way it curves

19:13.048 --> 19:16.048
I don't know why I came back here I
don't know i'm expecting to see

19:16.669 --> 19:21.320
well you're not going to hear the legend
says that she only lowers the equal

19:25.660 --> 19:28.700
look

19:28.700 --> 19:32.179
over there

19:32.179 --> 19:35.179
is that her

19:36.740 --> 19:39.740
I don't know

19:41.220 --> 19:42.740
bit

19:42.740 --> 19:45.500
but a campaign we can see her

19:45.500 --> 19:48.500
maybe in her eyes were evil no one

19:49.519 --> 19:51.990
yeah

19:51.990 --> 19:55.420
yeah

19:55.420 --> 19:55.980
thank you

19:55.980 --> 19:57.610
we did

19:57.609 --> 19:58.808
I'm gonna go asking

19:58.808 --> 20:01.808
yeah

20:07.410 --> 20:10.410
Jason

20:26.410 --> 20:29.860
yeah

pull out that seems to be the best thing
all around just so just concerning to

24:35.950 --> 24:39.519
have someone come up to you and tell you
that because of jeans or bone structure

24:39.519 --> 24:42.369
the length of your fingernail that you
have no chance at winning

24:42.369 --> 24:46.299
well I'll get over it Getty

24:46.299 --> 24:49.299
whoever wins this rice is you have a
once in life

24:56.329 --> 24:57.750
that's it

24:57.750 --> 25:03.029
you have more heart than anyone I not if

oh you're gonna hurt my feelings and my
head more than that

25:30.659 --> 25:35.129
why couldn't you just be straight with
Jesse I was straight with Jesse

25:35.128 --> 25:40.230
completely one hundred percent straight
that race meant everything to her and

25:40.230 --> 25:43.440
you purposely built up a hype so you
could not go back down

25:43.440 --> 25:47.190
I'm disappointed you think that's what I
did that's exactly what you did and it

25:47.190 --> 25:59.038
was vicious and it was cruel man . i
need to talk to you

25:59.038 --> 26:03.898
oh boy you said that I wasn't good
enough

26:04.528 --> 26:08.368
that's not exactly what I said I said
you weren't good enough to be guaranteed

26:08.368 --> 26:09.058
to win

26:09.058 --> 26:12.480
leave that up to me you also said that
you could make me better

26:12.480 --> 26:16.589
yes I did so make me better I can make
you better

26:16.589 --> 26:20.609
I don't do miracles no guarantees no
tricks to winning the xterra

26:21.210 --> 26:24.210
I'll take whatever you can do to give me
that extra edge

26:25.048 --> 26:30.298
you just do what you do and leave the
rest to me what do you say I say

26:30.298 --> 26:36.480
congratulations for what we're finding
your mental game you didn't have it

26:36.480 --> 26:39.240
before you were you were to accepting -
nice

26:39.240 --> 26:43.349
Jesse that's why you were blowing your
times don't don't get disappointed get

26:43.349 --> 26:44.248
pissed

26:44.249 --> 26:47.308
don't get upset go into a blind rage

26:47.308 --> 26:52.019
sometimes you have to have your guts
ripped out before you find out if you

26:52.019 --> 26:53.029
have them

26:53.029 --> 26:54.940
yeah

26:54.940 --> 26:58.390
see you in the morning

26:58.390 --> 27:01.390
sorry if I disturbed you

27:08.059 --> 27:11.059
yeah

27:18.359 --> 27:21.179
you were expecting hi

27:21.180 --> 27:24.180
let's say I was hoping she'd come back

27:27.929 --> 27:31.440
dawn I am I misjudged you

27:33.538 --> 27:36.309
okay you're not the first

27:36.309 --> 27:39.309
sometimes you're just not what you
appear to be

27:42.319 --> 27:43.069
yeah

27:43.069 --> 27:46.069
well for what it's worth

27:47.180 --> 27:50.310
I was wrong

27:50.309 --> 27:54.480
you were here for Jesse and the team all
along

27:55.829 --> 27:58.829
that's worth a lot

28:08.558 --> 28:11.910
take it

28:11.910 --> 28:15.250
and that was

28:15.250 --> 28:18.250
- power

28:24.799 --> 28:27.799
No

28:32.659 --> 28:35.659
and you

28:37.349 --> 28:40.349
you know

29:02.970 --> 29:05.970
No

29:14.000 --> 29:17.480
yeah

29:21.069 --> 29:24.069
yeah

29:27.140 --> 29:30.140
yeah

29:38.109 --> 29:42.769
not bad

29:42.769 --> 29:46.309
God you haven't had to be one of my best
times ever well you got your adrenaline

29:46.309 --> 29:48.470
going out to pressure you need that

29:48.470 --> 29:51.620
so that's the secret is not getting my
emotions involved

29:51.619 --> 29:54.769
that's part of it ok so what's the rest

29:54.769 --> 29:58.940
controlling your emotions it's like
remember when we work the banzai

29:58.940 --> 30:02.360
pipeline for the first time when we got
there there wasn't a ripple

30:02.359 --> 30:06.019
the body was flat the bay com that I
need to start this race

30:06.019 --> 30:10.309
no emotion then as we watch the water
from somewhere deep in the ocean swells

30:10.309 --> 30:13.970
began slowly at first just like you in
this race

30:13.970 --> 30:18.140
you need to let your emotions rise like
those waves remember how they came first

30:18.140 --> 30:21.800
the four-footers then the six footers
then the eight footers the power

30:21.799 --> 30:25.609
building like a great rage highly 12
foot waves crashing on the rocks

30:26.269 --> 30:29.960
relentless angry emotional yeah that's
the rest of it

30:29.960 --> 30:32.960
Wow

30:35.960 --> 30:41.600
keep your elbows in

30:43.190 --> 30:46.549
don't need a break anything to you me

30:46.549 --> 30:49.549
no way good go ahead and send now we're
going to go here

30:52.369 --> 30:55.489
okay here's the deal

30:55.490 --> 30:58.910
you're as good as you can be physically
even if you weren't there is nothing we

30:58.910 --> 31:02.840
can do about it in the next week anyway
but i keep studying the computer numbers

31:02.839 --> 31:06.559
and I found something I think i can get
you a three percent boost in your wind

31:06.559 --> 31:08.869
oxygen utilization three percent

31:08.869 --> 31:12.500
I know it doesn't sound like much but no
hey it's an extra stroke in 200

31:12.500 --> 31:16.579
freestyle and in the two mile swim it
could mean an extra minute if you pulled

31:16.579 --> 31:19.970
ahead of the pack by a minute in the
swim then even if you hold your own in

31:19.970 --> 31:23.390
the bike race and I can blow me away in
the run and that's how I think you're

31:23.390 --> 31:24.560
gonna win

31:24.559 --> 31:27.859
thanks let's go

31:32.059 --> 31:40.129
okay thanks again you when I when what I
hope not that race I told you not to run

31:40.130 --> 31:40.970
in

31:40.970 --> 31:47.420
you said he knew Jesse when we started
out I may not have told you everything

31:47.420 --> 31:50.240
you like to me

31:50.240 --> 31:53.269
I didn't think it would matter I thought
when she started training you'd realize

31:53.269 --> 31:57.619
you couldn't win this race and you lose
interest but Sean things changed

31:57.619 --> 32:02.839
Jesse changed she can win this race can
she yes the xterra is tougher than any

32:02.839 --> 32:05.179
other triathlon and Jesse can win it

32:05.180 --> 32:09.230
and that's supposed to change things
because she's trained for this dream I'm

32:09.230 --> 32:11.990
supposed to break all the rules and make
an exception

32:11.990 --> 32:15.829
you know every day is in Saturday on
Saturday

32:16.460 --> 32:19.789

nothing to say about what you do on

it really wasn't a hard decision to make

in fact I think that all the training
that I've been doing for the iron man
