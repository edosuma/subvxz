WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.442
WHY ISN'T ANYBODY WORKING?

00:08.442 --> 00:10.744
WHAT'S THE POINT, MAN?
THE FACTORY'S CLOSING DOWN.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.614
WE ALL NEED
TO FIND NEW JOBS.
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE,
GEORGE.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.616
LOOK, I'M FREAKED OUT
ABOUT FINDING A JOB, TOO,

00:15.616 --> 00:17.618
BUT THIS FACTORY
IS STILL RUNNING,

00:17.618 --> 00:19.620
AND WE STILL HAVE ORDERS
TO GET OUT,

00:19.620 --> 00:21.622
AND WE ARE GONNA FILL
THOSE ORDERS,

00:21.622 --> 00:23.624
BECAUSE WE TAKE PRIDE
IN OUR WORK.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.960
YEAH, WELL, PRIDE IS NOT
GONNA KEEP MY LIGHTS ON.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.262
(chuckles)
THAT'S OKAY, GINA,

00:28.262 --> 00:29.963
BECAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

00:29.963 --> 00:32.533
LIGHT DOES NOT
LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.836
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE PAPER FOR ME.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.638
TIME TO MOVE TO PLAN B.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.840
IF THE FACTORY'S MOVING
TO MEXICO,

00:39.840 --> 00:41.575
THEN I'M GOING WITH IT.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.644
ERNIE, THEY'RE ONLY HIRING
MEXICAN CITIZENS.

00:43.644 --> 00:47.715
WELL, THEN I'LL SNEAK
ACROSS THE BORDER, MAN.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.651
I'LL HIDE IN THE TRUNK
IF I HAVE TO.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.020
OH, QUE LA!
HIDE IN A TRUNK?

00:53.020 --> 00:55.756
NOBODY CARES
IF YOU GO THAT WAY.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.861
EVERYBODY, LISTEN.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.530
GET BACK TO WORK.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.665
YEAH, GET BACK TO WORK,
SUCKERS.

01:04.665 --> 01:08.636
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MOM?
YOU DON'T WORK HERE ANYMORE.

01:08.636 --> 01:12.140
NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT ME?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.375
YOU DIDN'T SHAVE
YOUR BACK TODAY?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.147
WAYNE BOUGHT THIS FOR ME.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.416
IT MAKES YOU LOOK
LIKE A HIGH-PRICED HOOKER.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.418
THANK YOU, GINA.
(chuckles)

01:24.418 --> 01:27.421
I FEEL LIKE
A HIGH-PRICED HOOKER.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.790
HEY, THE RENT-TO-OWN
FURNITURE KING

01:29.790 --> 01:33.026
NEEDS A RENT-TO-OWN QUEEN.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.695
HEY,
WHO'S THAT WITH JACK?

01:34.695 --> 01:37.798
MAYBE IT'S THE GUY FROM MEXICO
WHO BOUGHT THE FACTORY.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.800
MAYBE THE LAYOFFS
ARE STARTING NOW.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.836
NO WAY. THEY PROMISED US
THREE MORE WEEKS OF WORK.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.773
IF THIS IS OUR LAST DAY,
I'M GOING DOWN SWINGING.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.608
I'M GONNA TELL THIS GUY
HE JUST CAN'T

01:47.608 --> 01:50.478
TAKE OVER OUR FACTORY
AND GIVE OUR JOBS TO MEXICANS.
YES!

01:50.478 --> 01:52.480
THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS AMERICA.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.882
(Benny) YES!
WE'VE GOT OUR OWN MEXICANS.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.884
(cheering)

01:59.153 --> 02:00.654
OH, GEORGE, GOOD.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.724
I WANT YOU TO MEET ENRIQUE VEGA,
THE HEAD OF AeroMayan.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.460
MR. VEGA'S GONNA BE HERE
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.596
JUST TO WATCH
HOW WE OPERATE.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.734
'SUP?

02:16.604 --> 02:18.772
'SUP?

02:18.772 --> 02:21.942
YOU GOT A LOT OF ANGRY
FACTORY WORKERS OUT THERE.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.378
YOU'RE PRETTY BRAVE
COMING IN HERE BY YOURSELF.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.679
GEORGE, I HAPPEN TO BE

02:25.679 --> 02:28.849
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN
IN MEXICO.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.851
I DON'T GO ANYWHERE BY MYSELF.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.492
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.927
WELCOME TO YOUR FACTORY.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.499
I'M SURE THAT, UH,
EVERYONE OUT THERE

02:45.499 --> 02:48.302
REALLY SEES ME
AS A BAD GUY, BUT, UH--

02:48.302 --> 02:51.004
OH, WELL, I DON'T SEE YOU
AS THE BAD GUY.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.773
BOUGHT ME OUT FOR 20 MIL,

02:52.773 --> 02:55.709
AND HE WANTS ME TO CONSULT
AT HIS PLANT IN CANCÃºN.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.911
DOES "CONSULT" MEAN
DRINK TEQUILA ON THE BEACH

02:57.911 --> 02:59.913
UNTIL YOU PASS OUT?

02:59.913 --> 03:03.717
I PLEAD THE CINCO.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.622
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT,

03:08.622 --> 03:10.624
KNOWING YOU'RE RUINING
ALL THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES?

03:10.624 --> 03:13.527
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORRYING
ABOUT THE WORKERS, GEORGE.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.929
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.498
JIMMY.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.633
IF THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA BE,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.635
LET ME TELL YOU, VATO,
I PULL HAIR, I BITE,

03:21.635 --> 03:23.504
AND I AIN'T AFRAID
TO YELL "RAPE."

03:23.504 --> 03:24.938
VATO, GO FOR IT.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.509
RELAX.

03:28.509 --> 03:32.246
I WANT YOU TO WORK FOR ME
IN MY U.S. OFFICE IN PHOENIX.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.316
THAT'S A CONTRACT.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.618
YOU'RE OFFERING ME A JOB?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.553
YOU'RE ONE HELL OF A MANAGER,

03:39.553 --> 03:42.823
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO COORDINATE
MY SALES IN THE U.S.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.892
YOU INTERESTED?

03:55.135 --> 03:58.306
I'M GONNA SAY YES...

03:59.807 --> 04:02.810
BUT THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE
THINK THAT I'M GIVING YOU HELL.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.313
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
TO THINK THAT I SOLD OUT!

04:05.313 --> 04:09.483
I ASSUME THERE'LL BE BENEFITS
AND A HEALTH CARE PLAN!

04:12.386 --> 04:15.389
THERE WILL BE!

04:15.389 --> 04:19.192
AND A CORNER OFFICE
WITH A VIEW!

04:19.192 --> 04:23.764
COMPANY CAR!
6-FIGURE SALARY!

04:23.764 --> 04:27.635
DOES THAT INCLUDE
A DOLLAR SIGN AND COMMAS?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.306
NO!

04:40.381 --> 04:42.683
THANKS FOR HAVING
CONFIDENCE IN ME.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.754
THAT'S A GENEROUS OFFER,
AND I WILL ACCEPT IT GLADLY.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.956
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

04:48.956 --> 04:51.825
I WILL ACCEPT IT GLADLY!

04:53.193 --> 04:56.330
(cheers)

04:57.731 --> 05:00.934
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:03.971 --> 05:07.107
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:07.107 --> 05:08.676
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:11.845 --> 05:14.948
**

05:20.588 --> 05:22.956
ANGIE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.425
HEY, HONEY.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.628
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.530
HELLO!

05:29.530 --> 05:32.533
I FORGOT WHAT I NEEDED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.803
I READ THAT WHEN
MEN LOSE THEIR JOBS,

05:35.803 --> 05:39.106
THEY CAN FEEL EMASCULATED.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.475
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS

05:41.475 --> 05:46.414
AND REMIND YOU THAT
YOU ARE STILL ALL MAN TO ME?

05:46.414 --> 05:49.650
NO, YOU--YOU DON'T NEED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.652
I GOT A GREAT OFFER TODAY.

05:51.652 --> 05:56.424
ANGIE, YOU ARE GONNA BE
MAKING LOVE TO A RICH MAN.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.292
GEORGE, WE HAVE SAVINGS.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.029
WE DON'T HAVE
TO RESORT TO THAT!

06:03.997 --> 06:07.334
NO!

06:07.334 --> 06:09.503
COCHINA,
GET YOUR MIND STRAIGHT.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.706
I'M THE RICH MAN.
OH.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.709
THE GUY WHO BOUGHT THE FACTORY
OFFERED ME A JOB, ANGIE,

06:15.709 --> 06:18.812
WITH A COMPANY CAR, A CORNER
OFFICE AND DOUBLE MY SALARY!

06:18.812 --> 06:21.782
OH, HONEY, THAT'S GREAT!
(laughs)

06:21.782 --> 06:24.552
START PACKING, BABY.
WE ARE MOVING TO PHOENIX!

06:27.354 --> 06:30.257
PHOENIX?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.392
WOW. MOVING TO PHOENIX.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.561
(knock on door)

06:33.561 --> 06:35.062
DAMN, THAT'S ERNIE.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.766
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE JOB.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.901
BREAK IT TO HIM GENTLY.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.536
GEORGE!
I'M NOT TELLING HIM.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.337
YOU BEEN RICH
FOR TWO MINUTES,

06:44.337 --> 06:47.541
AND ALREADY YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE LITTLE PEOPLE, SELFISH.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.480
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE!
I FIGURED IT OUT, MAN.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.748
YOU AND ME SHOULD
START A BUSINESS TOGETHER.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.518
YEAH, WITH YOUR SALES
AND MANAGERIAL EXPERIENCE,

06:57.518 --> 06:58.752
AND MY ABILITY TO RUN

06:58.752 --> 07:01.321
A 3-PHASE,
BIG-BORE METAL LATHE--

07:01.321 --> 07:03.323
AS LONG AS
IT'S A PRE-'97 MODEL--

07:03.323 --> 07:05.058
WE COULD DO ANYTHING.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.794
UH... (clears throat)

07:06.794 --> 07:09.129
A-ACTUALLY, ERNIE, UM...

07:09.129 --> 07:13.100
(sighs) VEGA
OFFERED ME A JOB, BRO.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.402
I-I'M, UH...

07:15.402 --> 07:17.971
I'M-A MOVE TO PHOENIX.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.576
WOW, PHOENIX.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.579
WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S GREAT FOR YOU, GEORGE.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.247
NO, NO, MAN,
IT'S--IT'S--

07:27.247 --> 07:28.849
IT'S NOT THAT GREAT.

07:28.849 --> 07:33.587
(stammers) THERE--THERE'S
NO ROACH COACH, MAN, SO...

07:33.587 --> 07:35.656
I GOTTA EAT
IN A DINING ROOM.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.558
A-A-AND IT'S
GONNA BE NOISY

07:37.558 --> 07:40.227
BECAUSE THE HEALTH CENTER
THAT THEY SHARE

07:40.227 --> 07:42.229
WITH A MODELING AGENCY
IS RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.232
SO ALL DAY I'M-A HEAR
LIKE THAT--"HEY, GIRL,"

07:45.232 --> 07:47.635
WHAT-TCHA.
(imitates high heels clicking)

07:49.202 --> 07:51.639
WELL, I-I-I GUESS

07:51.639 --> 07:54.441
YOU GOTTA TAKE
WHAT YOU CAN GET, HUH?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.510
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MAN.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.146
I'M SORRY, MAN.
I MEAN, I...

07:59.146 --> 08:02.149
YOU KNOW, I WISH
I COULD TAKE YOU WITH ME.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.753
HEY, DON'T BE
SORRY FOR ME, VATO.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.989
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
YOUR VICTORIES ARE MY VICTORIES.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.325
HEY, HEY, NOW I'M GONNA HAVE
SOMEPLACE TO CRASH IN PHOENIX

08:12.325 --> 08:16.897
WHENEVER I DRIFT THROUGH
THE SOUTHWEST LOOKING FOR WORK.

08:18.465 --> 08:22.636
I CAN'T STOP WINNING.
YAY, ERNIE.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.238
(door closes)

08:29.677 --> 08:31.411
(sighs) THAT WAS ROUGH.

08:31.411 --> 08:35.315
IT'S HARD WHEN GOOD NEWS FOR YOU
IS BAD NEWS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.417
(cries) I DON'T WANNA GO.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.086
WHAT?

08:39.086 --> 08:41.521
WELL, I JUST
STARTED THINKING

08:41.521 --> 08:44.625
OF ALL THE THINGS
WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.794
I MEAN, GEORGE...

08:46.794 --> 08:49.162
WE--WE FELL IN LOVE HERE.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.465
WE CONCEIVED
OUR CHILDREN HERE.

08:52.465 --> 08:57.337
WE STILL HAVE THAT, ANGIE.
WE'RE TAKING THE COUCH.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.206
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.609
ANGIE, BUT THIS IS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY, OKAY?

09:01.609 --> 09:03.611
I WANT YOU TO BE EXCITED.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.813
I AM, BUT I'M SAD, TOO.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.548
I FEEL TWO THINGS.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.784
ESTÃ¡LOCA,
FEEL TWO THINGS!

09:10.784 --> 09:14.421
WELL, PICK THE EASY ONE
AND LET ME DEAL WITH THAT.

09:14.421 --> 09:19.593
NOW...
I FEEL UNSUPPORTED.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.394
(sobs) THAT'S THREE THINGS.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.598
I COME HOME UNEMPLOYED,
YOU WANNA TAKE ME UPSTAIRS.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.635
I TELL YOU
I GOT A GREAT NEW JOB,

09:27.635 --> 09:29.637
AND YOU WON'T STOP CRYING.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.873
I CAN NEVER DO NOTHING
IN THIS HOUSE.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.279
(sighs)
DAD, I WAS JUST THINKING.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.749
REALLY? AND WHAT
WAS THAT LIKE, HUH?

09:41.749 --> 09:45.152
DID IT TICKLE
THE INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.120
I'M SERIOUS.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.556
I DON'T WANNA
MOVE TO PHOENIX.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.058
I DON'T WANNA
CHANGE SCHOOLS.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.961
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE HERE.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.963
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR MOM WOULD TELL YOU?

09:55.963 --> 09:59.132
SHE'D SAY, "MAX, YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE NEW FRIENDS IN PHOENIX,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.902
AND IT'S ALL
GONNA WORK OUT."

10:01.902 --> 10:05.405
WHERE IS MOM?
UPSTAIRS CRYING.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.108
SEE? NOBODY WANTS TO GO.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.812
MAX, YOU ARE GOING WITH US.
END OF DISCUSSION.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.014
FINE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE OLD

10:14.014 --> 10:16.116
AND I'M MAKING THE DECISION
WHERE YOU LIVE,

10:16.116 --> 10:19.152
I'M PUTTING YOU IN
THE WORST PLACE I CAN THINK OF.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.288
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
TELL YOU THIS,

10:21.288 --> 10:25.392
BUT I'M TERRIFIED
OF THE PLAYBOY MANSION.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.468
HEY, GEORGE.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.537
HEY, VIC.

10:37.537 --> 10:41.174
JUST CAME BY TO SEE IF ANGIE'S
FEELING BETTER ABOUT THE MOVE.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.677
NO, MAN,
AND IT'S KILLING ME.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.179
I GOT THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY

10:46.179 --> 10:48.381
AND EVERYBODY'S MAKING ME
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.119
WELL, MOVING YOUR FAMILY'S
NEVER EASY.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.320
BUT TRUST ME,

10:53.320 --> 10:56.223
ONCE THEY GET TO PHOENIX,
THEY'LL LOVE IT.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.624
IT'S A GREAT TOWN.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.626
WHY DON'T YOU
MOVE WITH US, VIC?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.862
ANGIE WOULD LOVE THAT.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.130
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.365
THE HEAT, THE DUST,
ALL THE OLD PEOPLE--

11:05.365 --> 11:07.234
IT'S DEPRESSING, MAN.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.840
ANYWAY...

11:12.840 --> 11:16.376
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU GO, GEORGE.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.214
A POCKETKNIFE?

11:21.214 --> 11:25.652
MY FATHER GAVE ME THAT
WHEN I LEFT CUBA.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.855
I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.326
WOW, I MEAN,
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.964
YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS WANTED ONE, BUT I...

11:36.964 --> 11:41.201
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
HAD A DAD TO...

11:41.201 --> 11:43.336
I KNOW, MIJO.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.339
I BET THIS HAS
A LOT OF MEMORIES FOR YOU.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.640
OH, YEAH.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.142
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

11:49.142 --> 11:52.145
MY FATHER AND I
WOULD GO OUT TO THE FIELDS

11:52.145 --> 11:55.248
AND CASTRATE THE PIGS
WITH IT.

12:00.653 --> 12:05.125
I BET MY DAD AND I
WOULDA CASTRATED PIGS, TOO.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.105
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

12:18.105 --> 12:20.740
WHY ARE YOU SHRINKING?

12:24.177 --> 12:27.580
MOM, YOU THINK
I'M MAKING A MISTAKE

12:27.580 --> 12:29.416
MOVING TO PHOENIX?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.419
YOU HAVE TO GO
WHERE THERE'S WORK, GEORGE.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.487
THANK YOU.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.926
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:38.926 --> 12:41.761
OH, UM... AHEM--TAKING
A PICTURE OF MAX FOR WAYNE.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.264
YOU KNOW, HE THINKS
IF HE HAS A PHOTO

12:44.264 --> 12:46.266
OF A LITTLE MEXICAN BOY
ON HIS DESK,

12:46.266 --> 12:49.402
HE'LL BE ABLE TO SELL MORE
FURNITURE TO LATINOS.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.475
THAT'S A PICTURE OF ME.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.277
ARE YOU TAKING THIS

12:57.277 --> 12:59.746
BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY?

12:59.746 --> 13:02.916
PLEASE. (scoffs)

13:02.916 --> 13:05.518
YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.554
NO, I'M NOT.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.424
MOM, ADMIT IT
OR I'LL TELL WAYNE

13:11.424 --> 13:15.162
TWO OF THE THREE REASONS
WHY YOU CAN'T DONATE BLOOD.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.937
FINE.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.908
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.977
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.912
YOU JUST TOLD ME TO.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.847
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WOULD.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.415
I'M GETTING GUILT
FROM EVERYBODY,

13:35.415 --> 13:38.618
BUT THE ONE TIME I NEED YOU
TO BE A COLD, UNCARING MOTHER,

13:38.618 --> 13:40.220
YOU CAN'T GIVE THAT TO ME.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.090
WELL, I AM SORRY.
IT'S JUST HOW I FEEL.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.293
I'VE NEVER BEEN AWAY FROM YOU
FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.295
STOP IT!

13:48.295 --> 13:51.865
WHAT KIND OF TWISTED,
MENTALLY DERANGED GAME

13:51.865 --> 13:53.300
ARE YOU PLAYING?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.104
NEXT THING,
YOU'LL PROBABLY TELL ME

13:57.104 --> 14:00.140
HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.342
I DO CARE ABOUT YOU.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.978
THAT'S IT!

14:10.683 --> 14:12.685
(knock on door)

14:12.685 --> 14:16.589
HEY, GEORGE.
LOOK, MAN, IF YOU'RE COMING
OVER HERE TO TELL ME YOU'RE SAD

14:16.589 --> 14:19.526
TO SEE ME GO, Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.229
I DIDN'T COME DOWN HERE
TO TELL YOU THAT.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.464
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU,
CONCEITED.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.103
BUT DON'T READ THIS CARD
UNTIL I LEAVE, ALL RIGHT?

14:30.103 --> 14:32.305
MAN, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

14:32.305 --> 14:34.674
I NEED YOUR KEYS
TO THE FACTORY.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.245
WE'RE GONNA
TAKE OVER THE BUILDING.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.613
WE'RE GONNA OCCUPY IT
AND SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.615
THEN WE'RE GONNA
MOVE ALL THE MACHINERY

14:42.615 --> 14:45.152
OUT TO THE PARKING LOT
AS A PROTEST.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.520
YEAH, BUT WON'T THAT
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM

14:47.520 --> 14:50.223
TO PUT IT ON TRUCKS
AND MOVE TO MEXICO?

14:50.223 --> 14:54.894
NOT IF WE COVER 'EM WITH BUTTER
SO THEY'RE ALL SLIPPERY.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.296
WHAT-TCHA?

14:56.296 --> 14:58.999
YEAH, SO I NEED
YOUR KEYS TO THE FACTORY

14:58.999 --> 15:01.001
AND ALL YOUR BUTTER.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.303
LOOK, MAN, HERE'S
WHAT YOU GUYS NEED TO DO.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.373
YOU NEED TO LOCK YOURSELVES
IN THE FACTORY, RIGHT?

15:06.373 --> 15:09.476
AND CALL EVERY NEWSPAPER
AND RADIO STATION.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.279
YOU GOTTA PUT PRESSURE
ON THE NEW OWNER

15:12.279 --> 15:15.348
TO MAKE HIM RETHINK
WHAT HE'S DOING.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.018
YOU THINK THAT WOULD
ACTUALLY WORK?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.886
LOOK, IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.289
UH...

15:22.289 --> 15:24.324
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS...

15:24.324 --> 15:27.194
YOU GUYS CAN'T DO THIS
ON YOUR OWN, MAN.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.396
I'M GOING DOWN THERE.
HEY, ARE YOU SURE, GEORGE?

15:29.396 --> 15:32.199
THIS COULD MESS UP
YOUR JOB IN PHOENIX.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:32.199 --> 15:34.201
MAYBE I WANNA
MESS UP MY JOB IN PHOENIX.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.668
YOU GUYS NEED A LEADER.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.670
YOU DON'T GO TO WAR
WITHOUT A GENERAL.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.672
YOU DON'T PLAY FOOTBALL
WITHOUT A QUARTERBACK,

15:39.672 --> 15:42.475
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PACK
OF WOLVES WITHOUT THE HEAD WOLF.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.013
WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT?
THE--THE LONE WOLF.

15:46.013 --> 15:50.083
HOW CAN A LONE WOLF
LEAD A PACK?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.684
HE'S ALONE.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.888
WHAT IF THEY'RE FOLLOWING,
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW IT?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.724
YOU WANNA ARGUE ABOUT WOLVES,

15:57.724 --> 16:00.927
OR YOU WANNA
GO DOWN TO THE FACTORY?
NO, I WANNA GO TO THE FACTORY.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.331
BUT CAN WE TALK
ABOUT WOLVES ON THE WAY?

16:06.233 --> 16:08.935
AND WE'RE GONNA STAY HERE
UNTIL WE CONVINCE HIM

16:08.935 --> 16:10.937
TO KEEP THESE JOBS
IN AMERICA.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.006
THANKS FOR PUTTING US
ON THE AIR.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.607
HEY, EVERYBODY, WHO PLAYS

16:14.607 --> 16:16.209
YOUR FAVORITE
JAMMING OLD-SCHOOL HITS?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.211
(all) DR. FUNKENSTEIN
AND RODNEY!

16:18.211 --> 16:21.381
(all cheer)

16:21.381 --> 16:23.616
GEORGE.
ANGIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:23.616 --> 16:26.219
WELL, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
AND I HAD TO COME DOWN.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.720
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
DOING THIS

16:27.720 --> 16:29.856
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE L.A.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.459
YEAH, DAD,
I'LL MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.495
I'LL TEACH THOSE NEVADA KIDS
HOW TO SKATEBOARD.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.366
MAX, PHOENIX IS IN ARIZONA!

16:39.366 --> 16:42.102
SEE, THE MOVE'S
ALREADY A GOOD THING.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.171
HE LEARNED A NEW STATE.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.007
HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS FOR US.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.143
LOOK, IT'S NOT
JUST FOR YOU.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.412
ALL I HAD GROWING UP
WAS MY MOM,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.581
AND HALF THE TIME
SHE WASN'T THERE.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.451
NOW I'M SURROUNDED BY FAMILY
AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.453
LOOK, THAT'S ALL
I EVER WANTED, ANGIE,

17:00.453 --> 17:02.989
AND I'M GONNA FIGHT
TO KEEP IT.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.025
HEY, WHEN DO THE COPS GET HERE?
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.827
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.863
DON'T LET HER FOOL YOU, GEORGE.
YOUR MOM'S HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.034
THAT'S IT. THE THING I WAS GONNA
SHOW YOU ON THE FORKLIFT?

17:16.269 --> 17:20.673
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT JOINING
THE 8-FOOT-HIGH CLUB.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.908
HE DON'T NEED IT.

17:21.908 --> 17:25.512
HE'S ALREADY A MEMBER
OF THE 4-FOOT-HIGH CLUB.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.681
GEORGE... DO YOU HAVE
ANY EXTRA SLEEPING BAGS?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.683
LOOK, ANGIE, YOU GUYS
CAN'T STAY HERE.

17:30.683 --> 17:35.888
YES, WE CAN. I AM WITH YOU
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.226
THANKS, BABY.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.694
BUT, UH,
IF I SEE YOUR MOM AND WAYNE

17:41.694 --> 17:43.896
MAKE A MOVE
TOWARDS THAT FORKLIFT,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.465
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.934
THEY'LL NEVER
GET UP THERE.

17:47.934 --> 17:51.138
ERNIE COVERED IT ALL
WITH BUTTER.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.209
(footsteps approaching)

18:03.116 --> 18:04.684
LOPEZ, WAKE UP.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.354
STOP, SALMA,
I GOT A CRAMP.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.160
OH, VEGA.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.594
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.863
I PAID $20 MILLION
FOR THIS COMPANY.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.966
THEY THREW IN
A SET OF KEYS.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.169
COME IN MY OFFICE.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.179
I OFFERED YOU A GREAT JOB.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.680
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED

18:33.680 --> 18:35.748
AT THE WAY
YOU'RE PAYING ME BACK.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.484
YOU'VE EITHER
GOT A LOT OF GUTS,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.653
OR YOU'RE THE DUMBEST MAN
I'VE EVER MET.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.223
MAYBE I'M BOTH.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.994
LOOK, I CAN'T LEAVE THIS FACTORY
AND MY HOME, OKAY?

18:47.994 --> 18:49.562
THEY MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.864
WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH
WITH ALL OF THIS?

18:51.864 --> 18:55.402
HEY, I GOT YOU HERE, DIDN'T I?
NOW HAVE A SEAT.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.705
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW
WE CAN KEEP THIS FACTORY OPEN.

18:58.705 --> 19:02.575
GEORGE, YOUR PEOPLE
GET $16 AN HOUR.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.877
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE PAY IN MEXICO?

19:04.877 --> 19:08.481
$2.75. LOOK, I KNOW ALL
THE REASONS YOU'RE DOING THIS.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.884
I ALSO KNOW THAT
MOST OF YOUR BIG CONTRACTS

19:11.884 --> 19:13.353
ARE IN THIS COUNTRY,

19:13.353 --> 19:16.323
AND A BUNCH OF BAD PUBLICITY
IS GONNA COST YOU MONEY.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.492
ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN.
THE FACTORY STAYS.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.664
REALLY?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.834
YES, AND SINCE
JACK AND MEL

19:27.834 --> 19:29.836
ARE GONNA COME DOWN
TO MEXICO,

19:29.836 --> 19:33.005
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN
THIS PLACE BY YOURSELF.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.608
REALLY?

19:35.608 --> 19:38.245
YOU'RE A TOUGH NEGOTIATOR.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.013
I GUESS I AM.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.515
AND ALSO, UH...

19:42.515 --> 19:45.252
THE MAYOR FOUND OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.254
HE OFFERED ME
SOME TAX INCENTIVES

19:47.254 --> 19:49.756
THAT I COULDN'T TURN DOWN.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.992
THE DEAL WAS DONE
BEFORE I CAME IN HERE TONIGHT.

19:52.992 --> 19:57.864
ALL I HEARD WAS THE MAYOR
LISTENS TO GEORGE LOPEZ.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.567
SO I'M IN CHARGE, RIGHT?
NOBODY ABOVE ME?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.502
YOU'RE THE BEST
AT WHAT YOU DO.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.737
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
THIS COMPANY MAKING MONEY,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.507
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SEE ME HERE.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.677
DON'T SCREW IT UP.
THANK YOU.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.082
WHAT DID VEGA WANT?

20:16.082 --> 20:19.386
HEY, THE FACTORY'S STAYING OPEN,
AND I'M IN CHARGE.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.421
WELL, HE'S EITHER
A GIANT GAMBLER,

20:21.421 --> 20:24.857
OR HE'S THE DUMBEST MAN
I EVER MET.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.060
MAYBE HE'S BOTH.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.996
HEY, HEY, MOM, YOU KNOW,

20:29.996 --> 20:33.866
PART OF THE, UH, THE REASON
THAT I DECIDED TO STAY HERE

20:33.866 --> 20:36.369
WAS BECAUSE THAT YOU SAID
THAT YOU CARED ABOUT ME.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.037
OH, YEAH.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.907
WELL, THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.077
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.580
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.716
OH, GEORGE, STOP
BEING SUCH A BABY.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.285
IF YOU WANT ME TO PROVE
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU,

20:52.285 --> 20:55.021
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME
OVER THERE WITH A BIG STICK

20:55.021 --> 20:58.925
AND KNOCK SOME CANDY
OUT OF YOUR BIG PIÃ‘ATA HEAD.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.031
WELL, WADDLE OVER HERE
AND TRY IT,

21:05.031 --> 21:06.566
YOU NASTY LITTLE PENGUIN.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.906
YOU COMING OVER
FOR DINNER TOMORROW, MOM?

21:13.906 --> 21:16.476
OH, YEAH, I'LL BE THERE.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.278
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
UH, WE CANCELED IT.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.914
I WASN'T COMING, ANYWAY.
