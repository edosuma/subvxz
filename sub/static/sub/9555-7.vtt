Potsie, you got to sing out.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.385
I can't hear with you
blowing in my ear.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.580
Oh, man, what kind of
rehearsal is this?

02:01.688 --> 02:03.816
The drummer stays after school,
Malph's late,

02:03.924 --> 02:05.585
and you think
you're Boots Randolph.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.182
What are you yelling at me for?

02:07.294 --> 02:08.728
Boots.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.388
Boots Cunningham.

02:10.497 --> 02:11.396
(Plays note)

02:11.498 --> 02:12.397
Please, please.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.466
Hey, guys.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.591
.Hey, Malph.
.Hey, Malph.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.191
Malph, where you been?
It's about time.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.862
- I've been doing band business.
- Oh...

02:17.971 --> 02:18.938
You're gonna love this.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.371
I'm introducing
a whole new sound.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.636
A new sound, huh?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.575
What'd you do,
learn how to play the piano?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.907
(chuckles) Learn how to play...

02:26.013 --> 02:27.606
You haven't got it, Rich.

02:27.714 --> 02:28.704
Forget the piano.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.839
Wait till you see this.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.509
I've got a boom-ba.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.518
<i>BOTH:
Boom-ha'?</i>

02:33.620 --> 02:35.520
<i>Boom-ha, baby.</i>

02:35.622 --> 02:37.021
<i>(boom-ha danging)</i>

02:39.393 --> 02:40.417
(strums loudly)

02:40.527 --> 02:43.588
That was terrible.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.961
You never did like
"Stardust" anyway.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.365
Oh, Richard, Warren.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.834
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Mrs. C., Joanie.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.770
Ralph, oh, I see
you're-you're rehearsing

02:53.874 --> 02:55.808
for Joanie's Sweet 16 party.

02:55.909 --> 02:59.038
Mrs. C., I've got a whole
new sound for the band.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.308
Oh, what'd you do,
learn to play the piano?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.405
(laughs)

03:05.552 --> 03:06.849
It's a one-joke family.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.216
(strums loudly)

03:08.321 --> 03:12.019
Mom, if he plays this
at my party, I'll stay 15.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.684
Never mind. Ralph will behave.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.159
Now, listen, dear.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.424
Are you sure that you wouldn't
rather have your party

03:17.531 --> 03:19.966
in the ballroom
of the Pfister Hotel?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.468
Oh, no.
Mom, I grew up here at Arnold's.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.298
I've always hung out here.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.565
Well, I guess you're right.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.572
Young girls shouldn't
hang out at hotels.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.664
No.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.042
(French accent):
Oh, madame.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.011
Mademoiselle.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.604
Al and I talked it over.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.684
We're going with
the "Gay Paree" theme.

03:37.784 --> 03:38.683
I guessed.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.344
<i>Mais oui, madame.</i>

03:40.454 --> 03:43.947
Just imagine the finest
of French cooking.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.118
And for the piéce de résistance,

03:47.227 --> 03:51.095
I just finished an eight-foot
ice carving of the Eiffel Tower.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.429
But, Alfred, the party
isn't for five days.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.205
Clarence, clear out
the refrigerator!

04:01.541 --> 04:03.873
Well, that all just
sounds wonderful, Joanie.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.968
Now, what do I tell your father?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.639
Oh, uh, it's $12 a person, Mom.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.116
You know I can't
tell your father that.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.117
Alfred!

04:12.219 --> 04:14.984
Alfred, now, about this
$12 a person...

04:15.088 --> 04:18.250
Uh, Rich,
it's the "Gay Paree" theme.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.916
- Ah, terrific.
- Wait! Gay Paree!

04:20.026 --> 04:21.391
It's the cancan!

04:21.495 --> 04:23.486
<i>Humming
{boom-ha changing)</i>

04:31.772 --> 04:36.073
Well, there goes
50 cents for ten lessons.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.202
You should take
a dollar's worth.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.906
Oh, good-bye, Alfred.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.507
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.581
$1.19.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.727
Hi, sweetheart.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.528
Oh, Howard.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.626
What are you doing,
gift-wrapping tonight's dinner?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.034
No, Howard.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.835
Just more out-of-town gifts
for Joanie's birthday.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.841
This is from your cousin,
the Nortons.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.411
Well, I hope
it's something good.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.809
Remember last year,
when their Alice was confirmed,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.246
we sent them
a very expensive gift.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.114
Yes, Howard, but what is
a little girl gonna do

05:19.219 --> 05:21.017
with an electric drill?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.715
It's the thought
that counts, Marion.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.383
Besides, it had four speeds.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.687
(imitating drill)

05:26.793 --> 05:30.354
Stop playing, Howard,
and just take all this outside.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.528
Uh, Daddy! You're home early!

05:36.636 --> 05:40.539
No, I'd say
I got here just in time.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.474
Oh, uh, uh, this is my dad,
and, uh, this is my...

05:44.578 --> 05:45.943
Don't-don't tell me.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.309
This is your sister.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.313
(clicks tongue)

05:48.415 --> 05:51.043
(laughs)

05:51.151 --> 05:53.711
Uh, no. This is my mom.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.050
Folks, this is
Terrence Corrigan.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.056
But you can call me Tip.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.388
How do you do, Terrence?

06:00.493 --> 06:03.292
Tip Corrigan,
the star quarterback?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.956
Oh, boy, Tip Corrigan,
the quarterback!

06:06.066 --> 06:07.932
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.435
Oh, I-I'd love to stay
for dinner, Coach,

06:10.537 --> 06:13.563
but, uh, well,
you know how it is.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.300
Oh, yeah, sure, I understand.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.672
But you remember that
you're welcome here anytime.

06:17.777 --> 06:18.869
Right, Marion?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.778
Good-bye, Terrence.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.214
Uh, catch you later, sport?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.513
Oh, sure. Okay, Tip.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.146
No, Dad, I think
he was talking to me.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.587
Oh. Excuse me.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.351
Okay. (chuckles)

06:32.459 --> 06:34.427
Your pop's got
some sense of humor.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.494
Yeah.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.960
Got to go.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.735
Thanks, Tip.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.133
I love the sweater.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.899
Yeah, knew you would.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.736
It's made for you.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.469
(clicks tongue)

06:50.577 --> 06:51.476
Hey.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.546
See you.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.842
Bye.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.940
HOWARD: You take care
of that throwing arm, now!

06:58.051 --> 06:59.018
(laughs)

06:59.119 --> 07:00.644
Boy, oh, boy,
how do you like that?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.744
Yeah.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.654
Sweet 16, dating
the star quarterback, huh?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.658
Boy, our Joanie
has really matured.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.659
Yeah.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.990
Oh, and he gave me his sweater.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.893
You know, every girl
in the world wanted his sweater,

07:10.997 --> 07:12.123
and he gave it to me.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.757
(singsong):
Me, me, me, me, me.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.130
He gave it to me, me...

07:15.235 --> 07:16.225
(laughs)

07:32.652 --> 07:36.213
Now, I ask you, is this dazzling
or is this dazzling?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.452
Oh, Arthur, you just
take my breath away.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.493
That's formal coveralls.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.688
Well, a man...
a man has got to dress up

07:43.797 --> 07:46.289
when he's getting
an honorary degree from...

07:48.001 --> 07:50.629
MARION: "Home Study School
of Auto Repair."

07:51.972 --> 07:55.567
This is a very,
uh, uh, prestig... uh...

07:55.675 --> 07:57.871
pres... uh, important place,
you know.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.503
Oh, I know, I know.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.671
I've seen
their matchbook covers.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.614
Let me ask you a question.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.777
Are you sure that Shortcake

08:06.886 --> 08:09.651
understands that I can't make it
to her Sweet 16 party--

08:09.756 --> 08:11.747
it being the same day
and all that, huh?

08:11.858 --> 08:13.189
Oh, certainly, she understands.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.091
I mean, this is
such a big honor for you.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.527
The biggest.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.930
Only one other guy got an award
from this place, Bob Hope,

08:21.034 --> 08:23.298
and I'm picking it up in person.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.668
Arthur, I'm so proud of you.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.036
(chuckles)

08:28.141 --> 08:31.634
Oh, Arthur, I wish Joanie
could find a nice wonderful boy

08:31.745 --> 08:33.577
like you or Bob Hope,

08:33.679 --> 08:36.775
instead of this boy Tip
that she's going with.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.078
Arthur...

08:39.184 --> 08:41.085
she's just so young.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.417
Hey, cool yourself, Mrs. C.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.185
Young ladies change steadies
like socks.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.989
But you should hear the stories
I hear about him.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.221
Terrible!

08:50.330 --> 08:53.459
You could tell me.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.866
Well, he goes with
a million girls at once.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.339
Yeah.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.637
Now tell me one of those
terrible stories.

09:03.743 --> 09:07.646
Oh, it's just that I hear
horrible stories about him.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.841
I hear, you know, stories
about you, too, Arthur, but...

09:09.949 --> 09:11.212
Whoa.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.614
...I know they can't be true.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.652
What?

09:13.753 --> 09:14.948
The stories
that I hear about you.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.685
(chuckles) Mrs. C.,
I hope you have a wonderful day.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.123
Whoa.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.932
Oh, you miss me, Tip?

09:32.038 --> 09:34.405
No kidding?

09:34.507 --> 09:37.499
Why, I just saw you
a half hour ago.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.442
Yeah, a half hour's a long time.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.741
Yeah.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.780
Um...

09:41.881 --> 09:44.248
Uh, well, uh, uh...

09:44.350 --> 09:47.047
Oh, good, I found it. (chuckles)

09:47.153 --> 09:48.814
Cub Scout training.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.447
Yeah, I got to go, too.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.685
Good-bye, super hunk.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.321
Are you talking to Potsie?
(chuckles)

09:57.430 --> 09:58.420
Funny.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.657
It was Tip.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.097
Oh.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.397
Hey, listen, can I speak to you
for a second?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.595
What's the occasion?

10:04.704 --> 10:07.537
You haven't set foot in here
since 1955.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.972
Well, looks like you haven't
cleaned it since then either.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.277
Oh, you liked that one, huh?

10:12.378 --> 10:13.470
Oh, not especially.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.708
But I smile a lot
when I'm in a good mood.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.445
Oh, uh, Tip, huh?

10:19.552 --> 10:20.951
Yeah.

10:21.054 --> 10:25.514
Rich, you're the first to know,
I'm in love.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.820
(laughs)

10:26.926 --> 10:28.621
Oh, now, wait.
Before you say anything,

10:28.728 --> 10:30.287
I've heard all those stories
about Tip,

10:30.396 --> 10:31.830
and he told me himself.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.296
But that's all over now.

10:33.399 --> 10:36.096
It's true love for me and Tip.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.331
And you know what he said
to me today?

10:39.439 --> 10:41.737
"Go out for a pass"?

10:42.775 --> 10:44.038
Uh, what did he say
to you today?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.875
He said, "Rosebud,

10:46.980 --> 10:50.439
"you're the only girl
I've ever really cared about,

10:50.550 --> 10:53.178
and you're really special
to me."

10:53.286 --> 10:54.845
Yeah.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.286
Joanie, look, this is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.621
You see, uh,
you're 16 years old,

11:00.727 --> 11:04.595
and-and, well, this is
just a case of puppy love.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.927
Oh, no, Rich!

11:07.033 --> 11:09.400
It's-it's more than puppy love.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.700
I... l-l get a queasy feeling
in my stomach when I see Tip.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.400
Joanie, there's more to love
than queasiness.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.408
Oh.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.807
And when I think about him,

11:18.912 --> 11:20.380
my hands get all,
you know, all...

11:20.480 --> 11:21.641
Yeah, I know, I know.

11:21.748 --> 11:22.738
- Sweaty palms
- Yeah.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.873
- And the queasy stomach.
- Uh-huh.

11:23.983 --> 11:27.851
Mine, mine, mine.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.388
Yeah, I-I've been
through all that.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.457
I know what you're
talking about.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.550
Look, you're gonna meet
a lot of Tips

11:34.661 --> 11:36.060
before you find the right one.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.494
So just don't fall
too hard, okay?

11:38.598 --> 11:41.067
Just don't want to see you
get hurt. Careful.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.364
Thanks for worrying, Rich,
but I'm not gonna get hurt.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.564
This is true love
for me and Tip.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.141
All right, all right.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.576
But if you need anybody
to talk to, I'm always here.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.340
Thanks, big brother.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.407
Well, you keep these records.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.920
I'm a little too old for
"Toot Toot Tootles the Tugboat."

12:05.658 --> 12:08.320
Rosebud...

12:11.731 --> 12:15.565
...before I give you my sweater,
I just want you to know that

12:15.668 --> 12:19.002
I like you better than
any girl I've ever known.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.574
And...

12:21.674 --> 12:23.699
-you're really special to me.
- You're really special to me.

12:23.810 --> 12:24.902
Oh, hiya, baby!

12:25.011 --> 12:26.240
Don't "baby" me!

12:26.346 --> 12:28.075
Now, now, Joanie, hold on.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.774
So I'm special, huh?

12:29.882 --> 12:32.681
Everybody was right
about you, Tip.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.482
You're a... you're a real creep!

12:35.588 --> 12:37.386
Oh, and-and here's your sweater.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.458
Give it to someone
who'll enjoy it.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.458
I'm off!

12:40.560 --> 12:42.426
Now, wait a second, baby.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.428
We can work
this whole thing out.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.521
Now, now, why don't you and I
take a nice drive

12:46.633 --> 12:47.964
up to Inspiration Point, huh?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.091
(giggles)

12:49.202 --> 12:51.364
Why don't you go alone
and jump off.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.702
Now, now, Rosebud,
give us a kiss.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.002
Don't "Rosebud" me.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.873
Here's your kiss.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.536
Ow!

12:59.646 --> 13:01.171
(chuckles)

13:02.181 --> 13:04.172
(chuckles)

13:04.284 --> 13:06.981
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.781
(chuckles) Hey, Al.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.161
Joanie, what's the matter?

13:20.266 --> 13:24.134
Oh, nothing I couldn't handle.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.263
Al, have you ever
heard of anyone

13:27.373 --> 13:30.968
that-that didn't have a date
for their own Sweet 16 party?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.741
Yeah, yep, YEP, YEP-

13:38.384 --> 13:41.615
♪ ...in my heart. ♪

13:51.664 --> 13:53.223
- Hey, Shortcake!
- Shh!

13:53.333 --> 13:55.097
Fonz, my parents are sleeping.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.566
-(snaps fingers)
- Forgot.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.969
Middle class keep
very strange hours.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.905
Hey, look, I got
a two-hour ride ahead of me

14:03.009 --> 14:04.773
before I pick up my M.A.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.076
Master of Auto Reparations.

14:08.948 --> 14:09.847
Don't ask.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.213
Look, before I go,

14:12.318 --> 14:13.911
I want you to have this.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.250
I wrapped it myself.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.188
Oh, Fonz.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.059
Oh, it's a sachet.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.220
Yeah, that's French for
"smells good."

14:25.998 --> 14:27.159
And, look, you know what?

14:27.266 --> 14:29.462
The saleslady said you put this
in your dresser drawers,

14:29.569 --> 14:32.698
it makes your clothes
smell like rosebud.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.300
- Rosebud.
- Yeah.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.309
What's the matter?
You already got one?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.970
You don't like it?
I can return it.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.740
- You're not hurting my feel...
- No, no, Fonz, no.

14:41.848 --> 14:45.250
I love it, and that's so sweet.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.820
Oh, Fonz, I broke up
with my boyfriend,

14:47.920 --> 14:50.719
and-and I don't have a date
for my Sweet 16.

14:50.823 --> 14:55.522
Well, I don't think that guy
shows very good taste.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.088
(Snaps fingers)

14:59.198 --> 15:02.828
I know a guy that would be crazy
to take you to your party.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.131
You do?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.637
I do.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.673
What's he like? Is he cool?

15:08.775 --> 15:10.573
Very, very.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.405
Oh.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.105
He wears a leather jacket, huh?

15:14.213 --> 15:16.011
Everywhere but the shower.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.379
Well, thanks.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.384
But I can't.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.215
You're turning down a date
with the Fonz.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.312
What, are you crazy?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.325
I can't let you take me
'cause you feel sorry for me.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.895
Sorry?

15:28.995 --> 15:32.863
Hey, I would be very proud
to have you on my arm,

15:32.965 --> 15:36.833
taking you to your own party.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.166
You're gonna take those
pin curls out first, right?

15:41.207 --> 15:42.106
Thanks, Fonz.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.869
Uh, I'm pretty popular tonight.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.206
Dad and Richie asked me, too.

15:46.312 --> 15:50.271
Don't you understand after
us three, it is all downhill?

15:53.252 --> 15:55.653
Thanks, but, uh...

15:55.755 --> 15:58.781
you go pick up your degree
and don't worry about me.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.154
<i>I'm 16.</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:02.227
I'm mature.

16:02.328 --> 16:05.889
I may not be happy, but,
uh, honestly, I'll handle it.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.488
Thanks.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.931
Let me tell you something.

16:11.938 --> 16:16.307
That is the nicest turndown
I have ever gotten.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.869
As a matter fact,

16:19.979 --> 16:23.745
that's the only turndown
I ever got.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.477
Whoa.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.721
<i>MARION:
Are you ready, Joanie?</i>

16:35.828 --> 16:36.852
JOANIE:
Coming!

16:36.963 --> 16:40.194
- Oh, Joanie.
- Oh, Joanie.

16:40.299 --> 16:41.494
Wow, you look great.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.500
Thanks.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.434
Uh, I have an announcement.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.198
I'm not going to my party.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.272
What?

16:47.373 --> 16:48.898
What do you mean?
It's your party.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.036
Some Sweet 16 party--
my mom had to get me a date.

16:53.145 --> 16:56.137
Hey, there is nothing wrong
with Burton Fitch.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.086
Now, listen, young lady,
you are going to that party.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.211
Now, don't be silly.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.789
You'll have a good time.

17:03.890 --> 17:04.789
(doorbell ringing
repeatedly)

17:04.891 --> 17:05.949
Oh, oh, that's probably him.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.492
L-I want to get it.
I'll get it, Mom.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.083
I don't want you to appear to be
overly anxious.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.095
That's no problem, Rich.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.098
(doorbell continues ringing)

17:14.200 --> 17:15.497
(voice breaking):
Hi.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.126
Uh, doorbell's stuck.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.567
Got a screwdriver?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.332
Well, I-l don't think
we need a screwdriver.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.998
- Here, just...
-(ringing stops)

17:22.108 --> 17:23.040
(chuckles) Thanks.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.040
It's all right.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.234
I guess I should have knocked.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.742
Uh, no problem.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.507
Well, it's, uh... it's nice
seeing you again, Burton.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.140
Oh, nice seeing
you, too, Dickie.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.919
Have a nice time, Joanie.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.682
We'll see you later, Dickie.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.953
(Burton chuckles nervously)

17:40.059 --> 17:40.992
HOWARD:
Hello.

17:41.093 --> 17:41.992
Hi, Burton.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.153
Boy, did you grow up!

17:44.263 --> 17:45.321
Didn't she grow up?

17:45.431 --> 17:46.421
Thank you, Burton.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.398
Boy, you really grew up neat!

17:48.501 --> 17:49.764
Didn't she grow up neat?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.598
- Burton, isn't that candy?
- Boy, you...

17:51.704 --> 17:52.762
- Candy?
- Under the arm.

17:52.872 --> 17:53.964
Oh.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.097
Right. Here.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.971
Oh! I'm sorry!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.067
L-I can wash them off,
if you want.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.441
Oh, don't worry, Burton.

18:00.546 --> 18:01.604
Accidents happen.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.375
It's all right,
I'll get it.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.574
- Howard...
- Mm?

18:04.684 --> 18:05.845
You're on a diet.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.413
I was just gonna help you
pick them up.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.753
Uh, Mom, uh, well,
we'd better get going.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.189
Oh, yeah, we really should go.

18:14.293 --> 18:18.730
By the way,
I-l brought a Sweet 16 corsage.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.526
- For you. Yeah.
- For me.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.862
May I pin it on you?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.436
Sure, go ahead.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.937
It's really nice.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.042
Well, I could pin it here,
but you wouldn't like that.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.805
Why don't you try
the waist, huh?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.608
- All right.
<i>- I'll</i> hold it.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.614
(chuckles)

18:36.716 --> 18:38.081
She'll hold it.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.883
Oh, isn't that sweet?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.012
16 sugar cubes.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.988
Before we go,
I'd like to get a picture.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.684
Burton, will you and Joanie
stand over there

18:46.792 --> 18:48.692
-for just a minute?
- Sure.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.761
Yeah, that's it.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.852
Now, smile, Joanie.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.556
- Come on.
- All right.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.826
Oh, that's fine.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.866
Now, hold it.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.696
- Ah! Good, good, good.
- Good, good.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.863
Uh, Marion, you go stand
next to Joanie.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.633
Burton, would you take
one of the family?

19:01.741 --> 19:02.731
Oh, sure.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.503
Please.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.736
- All set.
- All right.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.472
All you have to do is
just look through there.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.446
- Uh-huh.
- And click the little button.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.572
Everybody ready?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.708
- All set.
- Say cheese!

19:16.622 --> 19:18.386
I guess I pushed
the wrong button.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.959
- Yeah.
- Yes, you did, Burton.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.946
<i>Voifé, c 'est magnifique.</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:24.114
Oh, Alfred, you're the Picasso
of hamburgers.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.987
(normal voice):
Do you want to eat it

20:26.092 --> 20:28.322
or should I frame it for you?

20:30.362 --> 20:31.625
You better frame it.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.756
A critic.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.356
(scoffs)

20:36.402 --> 20:40.270
So, the very next day, Jenny...

20:40.372 --> 20:42.033
You know Jenny?

20:42.141 --> 20:44.633
Oh, no, I don't go to Jefferson.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.677
I know.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.974
I thought everybody knew Jenny.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.514
(chuckles):
Well, anyway,

20:49.615 --> 20:51.879
Jenny got caught for smoking.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.478
In the boys' room!

20:55.588 --> 20:56.646
(giggles)

20:56.756 --> 20:59.418
Uh, Joanie, could I talk to you
for a second?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.492
Oh, sure.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.561
Uh, be right back.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.151
Great party, isn't it?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.526
Yeah, a real doozy.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.066
Look, Joanie,
our moms set this up,

21:08.167 --> 21:09.601
and it's-it's just not working.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.329
I mean, we've been here
over an hour,

21:11.437 --> 21:12.632
and I don't know anybody here,

21:12.738 --> 21:14.672
and you're having fun
without me.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.038
Well, you're not
leaving now, are you?

21:17.143 --> 21:18.872
L-I messed up the whole evening.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.241
- Hey...
- But, Burton...

21:20.346 --> 21:22.314
Happy Sweet 16, Rosebud!

21:22.414 --> 21:24.280
Oh. What are you doing here?

21:24.383 --> 21:25.851
This is a private party.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.885
Hey, baby-

21:27.987 --> 21:30.513
I decided to give you
another chance.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.647
(chuckles)

21:31.757 --> 21:34.124
- I'm warning you, Tip, I bite.
- Oh.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.887
Hey, bucko.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.626
You heard her.
It's a private party.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.200
Uh, I can handle it, Rich.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.790
(clears throat)

21:42.902 --> 21:45.337
I think the lady
wants you to leave her alone.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.565
Hey, beat it, junior.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.335
You don't want to mess with
Tip Corrigan, huh?

21:50.442 --> 21:52.809
Tip Corrigan?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.812
The Tip Corrigan?

21:54.914 --> 21:55.904
(chuckles):
Yeah.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.744
I didn't know! (laughs)

21:57.850 --> 22:00.012
Gee, could I shake your hand?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.314
Sure, kid.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.354
Great!

22:03.455 --> 22:06.117
Ow! That's my arm!

22:10.496 --> 22:13.989
And don't come back
until you learn some manners!

22:19.038 --> 22:20.528
Wow.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.767
So much for the floor show.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.401
And now, for tonight's
main attraction,

22:25.511 --> 22:27.843
our very own Sweet 16 girl...

22:29.648 --> 22:31.138
Excuse me.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.480
Sweet 16 young lady...

22:35.287 --> 22:38.154
...will share this dance
with her favorite fella.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.216
Joanie.

22:41.327 --> 22:42.920
Please stay.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.894
The next dance is for you, okay?
