01:03.733 --> 01:06.133
EPISODE 1

01:46.100 --> 01:47.400
Why are you so startled?

01:49.900 --> 01:52.133
I didn't know that you were coming here.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.400
Seung-ryong Hong is dead.

01:57.633 --> 01:58.933
All our agents

01:59.000 --> 02:00.066
were also found dead.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.000
Let's take a walk.

02:09.966 --> 02:13.033
Have you heard of Pan-European Picnic?

02:15.066 --> 02:16.833
In 1989,

02:17.933 --> 02:19.900
Hungary, a then-communist country,

02:20.766 --> 02:22.733
opened its borders

02:22.900 --> 02:24.400
to exile thousands of East Germans

02:24.666 --> 02:26.733
to West Germany.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.166
This led to

02:29.866 --> 02:32.266
the fall of the Berlin Wall,

02:33.500 --> 02:35.433
which led to the end of the Cold War.

02:39.566 --> 02:40.466
You have

02:41.333 --> 02:42.566
a solo mission.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.933
Just like Hungary played

02:48.666 --> 02:51.766
a pivotal role
in the reunification of Germany,

02:52.400 --> 02:53.633
you'll be able play the same role

02:53.700 --> 02:56.166
in reunifying the Korean Peninsula
if you succeed in your mission.

04:04.366 --> 04:05.900
Who is the assassination target?

04:06.200 --> 04:07.266
It's Seong-cheol Yun.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.033
The president of
the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium?

04:13.266 --> 04:14.133
That's right.

05:16.366 --> 05:18.733
Report the situation of the square
every two hours.

05:21.466 --> 05:22.366
Where are the snipers?

05:22.733 --> 05:23.633
I've placed them

05:23.700 --> 05:26.366
in a triangular position, so their ranges
are overlapped by one another.

05:30.900 --> 05:31.900
What about that building?

05:32.466 --> 05:34.200
We will completely close the building.

05:39.466 --> 05:42.000
-Keep track of the South Korean agents.
-Yes, sir.

05:42.366 --> 05:45.533
See if we can jam satellite transmissions
between South Korea and the U.S. that day.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.466
Yes, sir.

06:19.533 --> 06:20.533
There's one-minute left.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.533
Okay.

06:37.766 --> 06:38.666
Final report.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.966
Ready.

06:41.633 --> 06:42.633
Ready.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.133
Ready.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.466
All set.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.566
President Yun!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.466
Are you okay, sir?

07:17.966 --> 07:18.900
Ambulance!

07:20.400 --> 07:21.300
Call an ambulance!

08:06.566 --> 08:07.400
Stop the car.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.566
I've succeeded in the mission.

08:36.466 --> 08:38.299
I'm hiding in the safe house.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.400
I've been shot,

08:42.666 --> 08:44.466
so I can't escape by myself.

08:46.433 --> 08:47.466
I'm requesting a rescue.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.333
For now,

08:51.466 --> 08:52.766
it's impossible

08:53.966 --> 08:54.933
to escape this place.

08:57.066 --> 08:58.833
All I can say to you now

09:00.900 --> 09:02.933
is to comply with the rules for agents.

09:04.366 --> 09:05.233
Sir,

09:06.900 --> 09:08.900
I have a reason that I must return alive.

09:10.933 --> 09:11.766
Please help me.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.066
Sir.

09:18.100 --> 09:18.933
Sir.

10:34.466 --> 10:35.900
His location has been identified.

10:36.433 --> 10:37.266
Move out.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.466
POLITICS AND DIPLOMACY OF THE U.S.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.933
Things that everyone

13:38.466 --> 13:40.800
in the world believes to be true

13:40.966 --> 13:43.066
turn out to be false time to time.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.666
That is...

13:46.800 --> 13:47.833
That is especially true

13:48.000 --> 13:50.800
when it comes to political ideology.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.600
You, the one that just came in.

13:54.866 --> 13:55.733
Yes, sir.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.066
Who assassinated President Kennedy?

13:59.100 --> 13:59.966
Wasn't it Booth?

14:00.733 --> 14:02.166
John Wilkes Booth

14:02.333 --> 14:03.433
assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.466
Oh, right.

14:04.533 --> 14:05.566
Oswald, it was Oswald.

14:06.133 --> 14:06.966
That's right.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.033
Oswald

14:09.566 --> 14:11.300
was killed by Jack Ruby,

14:11.666 --> 14:13.566
two days after he was arrested.

14:14.533 --> 14:15.366
However,

14:16.066 --> 14:18.166
there are a few conspiracy theories

14:18.766 --> 14:19.666
regarding the death

14:19.733 --> 14:22.000
of President Kennedy.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.633
Does anyone here
know about the conspiracy theories?

14:31.000 --> 14:31.966
Yes?

14:33.266 --> 14:34.933
Some claim that it was the CIA

14:35.300 --> 14:37.600
or Director Hoover of the FBI
who had him killed.

14:37.966 --> 14:39.500
Also, there are people who claim that

14:39.733 --> 14:42.533
it was done by the Soviet Union, Cuba
or the U.S. military-industrial complex.

14:42.766 --> 14:44.266
Which theory

14:44.500 --> 14:47.000
do you think is the most credible?

14:47.733 --> 14:48.600
I found

14:48.766 --> 14:51.366
the theory of the U.S. military-industrial
complex the most convincing.

14:51.633 --> 14:52.466
Why do you think so?

14:52.833 --> 14:56.133
President Kennedy decided to withdraw
U.S. forces from Vietnam.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.733
So the military-industrial complex,
which had to sell its arms,

14:58.800 --> 15:00.566
had a good reason to kill him.

15:02.966 --> 15:03.933
What do you think about it?

15:06.533 --> 15:07.466
Well...

15:08.366 --> 15:11.366
Conspiracy theorists full of skepticism
produce nonsense claims.

15:21.866 --> 15:24.500
As you know, the Vietnam War stepped up
after the Gulf of Tonkin incident

15:24.666 --> 15:27.833
where the North Vietnamese attacked
a U.S. destroyer.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.100
But according to the Pentagon Papers
released in 1971,

15:31.366 --> 15:32.966
there's a possibility
that the U.S. military

15:33.066 --> 15:36.033
manipulated the incident to make
a reason to intervene in the war.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.200
Kennedy,

15:38.466 --> 15:40.633
who planned to withdraw U.S. forces,
was killed in 1963,

15:41.066 --> 15:42.266
and the Gulf of Tonkin incident

15:42.733 --> 15:46.666
that got the U.S. involved
in the Vietnam War place in 1964.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.666
And the then-Vice President Johnson
who was involved

15:53.333 --> 15:55.700
with the industrial-military complex
became president of the U.S.

15:56.866 --> 15:58.966
If someone still says
that it's all just a mere conjecture

15:59.066 --> 16:00.900
of conspiracy theorists,
even after knowing this,

16:02.333 --> 16:04.566
wouldn't he be too naive or foolish?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.133
Do you want to sit here?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.599
Well,

17:07.666 --> 17:08.933
we just met in the class...

18:00.600 --> 18:01.633
How is campus life?

18:02.100 --> 18:03.133
I think it'll be fun.

18:03.866 --> 18:04.766
"Fun"?

18:05.033 --> 18:06.900
-For  you ?
-You,

18:07.066 --> 18:08.566
will meet my girlfriend soon.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.033
You already made one
on the very first day?

18:12.333 --> 18:13.466
She's the love of my life.

18:14.233 --> 18:15.333
Give me a break.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.900
Let's go!

18:50.733 --> 18:53.166
It's 56 minutes, 23.03 and 23.06 seconds.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.866
-Bravo, let's go for it!
-Bravo, let's go for it!

19:13.933 --> 19:14.800
-Alpha!
-Alpha!

19:21.366 --> 19:22.500
Aren't they creepy?

19:23.066 --> 19:24.633
How can they stand
in front of the targets?

19:25.366 --> 19:26.400
Tell me about it.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.500
This match

19:31.666 --> 19:33.200
will be very fierce.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.466
Three shots between the eyes

19:36.933 --> 19:38.233
and three shots on the belt buckles.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
The time limit is

19:39.833 --> 19:40.733
30 seconds.

19:47.066 --> 19:48.033
Lights!

20:04.800 --> 20:05.700
What is it?

20:05.866 --> 20:06.766
Why aren't they shooting?

20:19.566 --> 20:20.600
Okay. Bull's eye.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.000
Alpha wins!

20:52.666 --> 20:53.833
That can't be right.

20:56.466 --> 20:57.433
Goodness.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.400
-Gosh.
-Sergeant Kim,

21:01.466 --> 21:02.533
great job.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.800
This isn't fair.

21:03.866 --> 21:05.233
That was a really hard shot to make.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.233
Don't play around during drills.

21:08.633 --> 21:09.966
Yes, sir.

21:15.266 --> 21:16.300
Crazy kid.

21:32.466 --> 21:33.666
Are you still up?

21:34.033 --> 21:34.866
Yes.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.566
Goodness.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.166
Are you...

21:41.533 --> 21:43.100
Are you studying right now?

21:46.966 --> 21:48.033
You were grumbling

21:49.300 --> 21:51.066
when the captain told you
to attend the college,

21:51.133 --> 21:54.366
saying it's a punishment.
But you're studying now?

21:57.066 --> 21:59.300
If you're going to study like that,
just go to sleep.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.733
I'm just reading it.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.233
What?

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
I'm just reading it.

22:05.633 --> 22:06.666
You weirdo.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.200
Goodness.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.066
Gosh.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.833
Just go to bed.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.733
It's for your sake.

22:17.933 --> 22:18.833
Today,

22:19.066 --> 22:21.166
we'll discuss about the Gulf War.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.166
Before we start,

22:23.233 --> 22:24.733
can anybody tell us

22:24.900 --> 22:26.333
about the implications of the Gulf War?

22:31.333 --> 22:32.233
Yes.

22:33.366 --> 22:34.366
The Gulf War

22:34.466 --> 22:37.666
is a war that broke out
at the Persian Gulf

22:38.566 --> 22:40.933
for 44 days from January 16th
to February 28th, 1991.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.300
On August 2nd, 1990,

22:43.566 --> 22:46.766
The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein,
invaded Kuwait.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.866
So coalition forces from 36 nations
including the U.S.,

22:49.066 --> 22:51.966
Great Britain, Germany,
France and the Republic of Korea

22:52.133 --> 22:55.166
completely expelled Iraqi troops
from Kuwait.

22:55.433 --> 22:56.533
Okay, good.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.100
In that war,

22:59.533 --> 23:00.566
it was reported

23:01.200 --> 23:07.066
that 4,000 tanks, 2,140 artillery pieces,
1,856 armored vehicles

23:07.233 --> 23:10.266
and 240 combat aircraft
of the Iraqi military were destroyed.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.766
Good. Thank you.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.366
Regarding casualties,

23:13.433 --> 23:16.666
the death toll of Iraqi forces
was over 100,000 men.

23:16.766 --> 23:19.100
Also, 300,000 injured, 150,000 missing,

23:19.166 --> 23:20.800
and 60,000 were captured.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.533
However, losses in the coalition forces
were insignificant.

23:34.733 --> 23:36.266
Interpreting the war's implications

23:36.433 --> 23:38.633
with mere numbers
that were just crammed into your head

23:38.933 --> 23:41.666
is something
that's excessively naive or foolish.

23:42.833 --> 23:44.800
I believe it's important to understand

23:44.866 --> 23:46.733
that the Gulf War
wasn't just a territorial dispute

23:46.800 --> 23:49.233
but the intention of great powers
to reorganize the world order

23:49.500 --> 23:51.266
underlies the war's break out.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.300
So what we should pay attention to

23:56.100 --> 23:57.933
are the causes of Gulf War syndrome,

23:58.333 --> 24:00.566
and the hidden motives of the great powers

24:00.633 --> 24:03.966
regarding the distribution
of oil resources.

24:08.666 --> 24:09.666
Excellent.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.933
Hey.

24:32.800 --> 24:33.666
What?

24:34.200 --> 24:37.166
You just repeatedly branded me as a naive
and foolish person. And you say "what?"

24:37.233 --> 24:38.066
Goodness.

24:38.866 --> 24:40.833
I'm not that foolish, okay?

24:41.533 --> 24:42.800
I just said

24:42.866 --> 24:44.366
what I saw and felt.

24:44.733 --> 24:45.833
You're driving me crazy.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.233
I guess you don't know who I am.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.566
I'll give you a chance to get to know me.

25:04.066 --> 25:05.133
Let's go have some tea.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.066
Well,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.600
having a chat over a cup of tea
isn't my style.

25:22.766 --> 25:23.800
I prefer a good drink.

25:28.266 --> 25:29.333
Gosh.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.366
I'd be grateful.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.466
So you like to drink.

25:36.633 --> 25:38.666
Well, I don't hate it.

25:38.733 --> 25:41.400
Do you have any favorite place?

25:41.466 --> 25:43.633
I do have one. Let's go there.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.166
I'm almost an expert in mixing drinks.

25:52.866 --> 25:54.200
The ratio matters the most.

25:56.266 --> 25:57.600
Good.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.733
All right.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.233
Try it.

26:03.766 --> 26:05.133
I'm sure you'll find it perfect.

26:16.666 --> 26:18.266
Wow, you drink well.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.433
How is it? Isn't it perfect?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.166
It's a bit mild.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.800
Let me mix one.

26:23.966 --> 26:25.733
Sure, if you want to.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.433
Will you be all right?

26:47.233 --> 26:48.566
Bottoms up.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
Wow.

27:01.133 --> 27:02.766
You're a very good drinker.

27:02.833 --> 27:03.733
Wow.

27:04.366 --> 27:06.100
Oh, my.

27:13.000 --> 27:13.866
It's me.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.566
I'm not coming back tonight.

27:16.666 --> 27:17.600
Hey, wait.

27:17.666 --> 27:18.933
You're going all the way already?

27:19.866 --> 27:20.800
No.

27:21.466 --> 27:23.166
Technically, I am not going home.

27:23.233 --> 27:24.100
You brat.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.033
I knew it when you said
she's the love of your life.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.966
You two just met.

27:29.033 --> 27:29.866
Shut it, you punk.

27:30.033 --> 27:30.866
I'm hanging up.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.766
Gosh, what a little...

27:35.166 --> 27:36.166
Gosh!

27:36.566 --> 27:37.966
Damn it.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.366
So did you learn a lot about me?

27:48.066 --> 27:49.066
Well...

27:49.933 --> 27:50.866
Yes.

27:51.233 --> 27:52.266
What do you think?

27:53.900 --> 27:54.833
Well...

27:54.900 --> 27:55.800
It's a bit weird

27:55.966 --> 27:57.600
to say this myself,

27:59.033 --> 28:00.566
but I really didn't memorize

28:00.633 --> 28:02.400
the things I said during the lecture.

28:03.733 --> 28:04.900
Really, I remember everything

28:05.066 --> 28:06.300
I read just once.

28:08.633 --> 28:09.766
You don't believe me, do you?

28:11.633 --> 28:12.600
Wait.

28:15.733 --> 28:16.600
Oh.

28:17.733 --> 28:20.066
PORK RIBS GRILLED SAURY PORK NECK
GRILLED CLAMS

28:23.166 --> 28:25.633
PORK SKIN PORK RIBS GRILLED CLAMS
GRILLED SAURY GRILLED CROAKER

28:26.766 --> 28:27.900
Done.

28:28.266 --> 28:29.166
Check it.

28:29.233 --> 28:30.100
Check what?

28:30.166 --> 28:32.066
Ask me any menu on the wall.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.533
Why should I do that?

28:34.800 --> 28:37.400
It's because you think
I'm a naive and foolish person.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.166
Just ask me anything. Come on.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.166
Just give it a shot.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.266
Well...

28:44.700 --> 28:45.833
Then recite all the menus here.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.366
The small ones or the big ones?

28:48.733 --> 28:49.666
Well...

28:50.100 --> 28:51.100
The one above the small one?

28:52.366 --> 28:53.800
The one above the small one.

28:54.933 --> 28:55.866
Okay.

28:56.933 --> 29:00.366
Pork skin, pork ribs, grilled clams,
grilled saury, grilled croaker,

29:00.666 --> 29:04.566
broiled pollack, chicken gizzard,
chicken feet, clam stew, shrimps and eels.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.366
Then, six-dollar menu?

29:11.233 --> 29:14.566
Pork ribs, grilled saury, pork neck
and grilled clams.

29:21.833 --> 29:22.800
Got it?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.566
The customer service center's
phone number?

29:28.066 --> 29:29.600
It's 0803342888.

29:37.666 --> 29:38.733
The barcode number?

29:40.566 --> 29:47.266
It's 9, 9... and 064210033 and 9.

29:55.366 --> 29:56.966
The more you get to know about me,

29:57.066 --> 29:58.466
the more surprises you'll find.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.700
Cheers.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.800
Are you okay?

30:17.700 --> 30:19.133
You don't know about me, yet.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.600
I hardly get drunk with this.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.100
Pass me your glass.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.966
-Are you not drinking?
-No, I'm about to.

30:53.133 --> 30:54.033
Bottoms up.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.333
Hey, hey! Get up!

31:13.400 --> 31:14.900
We need to close now!

31:15.866 --> 31:16.933
Goodness.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.400
It's going to be morning soon.

31:19.733 --> 31:21.433
Please wake up!

31:25.666 --> 31:26.566
Where is...

31:27.400 --> 31:29.300
She paid the bill and left.

31:38.533 --> 31:39.566
Goodness.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.233
Gosh.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.133
Be careful.

32:34.933 --> 32:37.233
You must be lucky today.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.100
I was in such great condition today.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.933
It's you who's lucky.

32:42.566 --> 32:44.233
If only my condition
wasn't the worst today,

32:44.300 --> 32:45.966
you would have been as good as dead.

32:48.133 --> 32:48.966
Hey,

32:49.466 --> 32:50.466
how was it?

32:50.933 --> 32:51.866
What do you mean?

32:52.466 --> 32:54.600
You've been sluggish the whole day.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.766
I guess that wench was incredibly good.

32:58.166 --> 32:59.033
Come on.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.600
You can't call my girlfriend
a wench, you idiot.

33:05.666 --> 33:07.400
Now, I'll hear you scream.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.100
In 1972,

33:43.233 --> 33:45.333
when the Olympics
was being held in Munich,

33:46.533 --> 33:48.700
The Black September Organization

33:48.966 --> 33:50.633
took in many Israeli hostages.

33:51.633 --> 33:53.666
Since then, the world
has seen and understood

33:54.133 --> 33:55.233
the agony of Palestinians.

33:55.966 --> 33:57.433
I believe all of you are aware of this,

33:57.500 --> 33:59.666
but I'd like to look deeper into it...

34:15.233 --> 34:17.133
That's all for today.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.166
Thank you.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.266
-Sir.
-Yes?

34:27.333 --> 34:31.166
Do you remember that girl? I mean...

34:32.466 --> 34:35.066
She talked about the Gulf War,
and you said she was excellent.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.400
-Right, I said she was excellent.
-Yes.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.199
She hasn't been around these days.

34:39.566 --> 34:41.800
Well, I have no idea.

34:42.066 --> 34:43.166
Isn't she your student?

34:43.433 --> 34:45.933
She was an auditor.

34:46.566 --> 34:49.199
I accepted her
because the department office asked me to,

34:49.733 --> 34:51.366
but I don't even know her name.

34:51.966 --> 34:52.900
Why?

34:53.266 --> 34:54.199
Did something happen?

34:54.266 --> 34:55.566
No, not really.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.833
Thank you.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.066
So, who is she?

35:31.133 --> 35:32.466
I know nothing about her.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.066
I don't even know her name

35:36.000 --> 35:37.066
and where she lives.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.733
Gosh.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.866
I feel as if I'm possessed by something.

35:41.466 --> 35:43.233
What a weird wench.

35:46.900 --> 35:47.733
I'm sure

35:47.900 --> 35:51.166
that the wench is a gold digger
who bewitches naive guys like you.

35:52.266 --> 35:54.766
You should consider yourself lucky,
since nothing happened to you.

35:56.433 --> 35:58.466
Goodness.

36:00.733 --> 36:02.600
Hey, I'm going to meet my friend
from my hometown.

36:02.666 --> 36:03.700
Why don't you come with me?

36:05.600 --> 36:07.033
Let's have a drink and forget about her.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.100
No, thanks.

36:22.066 --> 36:23.000
Sang-hyun.

36:24.566 --> 36:26.200
It's been a long time.

36:26.566 --> 36:28.100
Tell me about it.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.666
It's been about three years, right?

36:29.733 --> 36:30.766
No, it's been much longer.

36:30.866 --> 36:33.000
We last met before I enlisted
in the special task force.

36:33.100 --> 36:36.333
-Is that right? It's good to see you.
-It's nice to see you.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.166
Let me pour you a shot.

36:38.233 --> 36:40.666
-No, let me pour you one first.
-It's okay. Please let me.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.533
It's been a really long time.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.566
Indeed.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.766
-Let's have a toast.
-Okay.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.533
How are you doing?

36:51.500 --> 36:53.900
Well, I'm a soldier.
I have nothing special going on.

36:54.066 --> 36:55.066
What about your business?

36:55.133 --> 36:56.566
I heard that the IT industry is booming.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.200
Well,

36:58.266 --> 36:59.500
I'm just making ends meet.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.866
No way. Come on.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.366
You and Jung-woon, who's a prosecutor,

37:03.433 --> 37:04.466
are the most successful ones

37:04.533 --> 37:06.366
from our hometown, right?

37:08.600 --> 37:09.466
I also want to

37:10.166 --> 37:12.266
get into business after I retire.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.666
You'll hire me, won't you?

37:14.166 --> 37:15.500
Sure, if you want,

37:15.666 --> 37:17.066
I'll hire you anytime.

37:17.466 --> 37:18.366
Thank you.

37:18.433 --> 37:19.666
No problem.

37:22.266 --> 37:23.766
Please let me pour you a drink.

37:23.833 --> 37:24.900
Over here!

37:24.966 --> 37:25.800
Over here.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.533
Hey, hey.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.500
Gosh.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.666
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

37:53.233 --> 37:55.233
This is Jin-ah Han.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.366
She is the manager
of our planning department.

37:59.100 --> 38:01.966
She's so dogged that she even attends
a grad school despite her busy schedule.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.900
How is he? He's handsome, isn't he?

38:13.266 --> 38:14.100
Well,

38:14.866 --> 38:15.766
if it's okay with you,

38:16.466 --> 38:18.366
I'd like to treat you to another drink.

38:18.733 --> 38:19.733
Well...

38:19.900 --> 38:20.766
I'm sorry.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.900
I should go home early today.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.300
Hold on a second.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.200
Sang-hyun, can we talk?

38:37.300 --> 38:38.133
How is she?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.266
Isn't she fine?

38:40.300 --> 38:41.366
Gosh,

38:41.766 --> 38:43.000
she's more than fine.

38:43.966 --> 38:44.800
I've never seen

38:44.866 --> 38:47.300
such beautiful lady.

38:51.466 --> 38:52.433
I'm counting on you.

38:53.633 --> 38:54.566
It's...

38:54.733 --> 38:55.933
all up to you now.

39:18.266 --> 39:19.300
We just met in the class.

39:22.066 --> 39:23.066
I prefer a good drink.

39:38.533 --> 39:40.200
Hyun-jun!

39:40.333 --> 39:41.633
Hyun-jun!

39:43.233 --> 39:44.733
Are you crazy?

39:45.266 --> 39:46.833
Yes, I am crazy.

39:47.366 --> 39:48.666
Did something good happen?

39:49.066 --> 39:50.100
Hey.

39:50.766 --> 39:55.166
It's  you  who will see
my girlfriend soon, you punk.

39:58.433 --> 40:00.066
It's sad that you were bewitched

40:00.133 --> 40:01.700
by that gold digger.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.566
But as I just found the lady I love,

40:04.866 --> 40:06.766
why don't you console yourself with that?

40:06.833 --> 40:07.666
What is she like?

40:12.066 --> 40:14.266
She works for the company
of my hometown friend.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.233
My heart is pounding so much
that I can't even describe her.

40:18.300 --> 40:21.000
She's exactly my type,
and she's killer hot.

40:21.733 --> 40:22.633
In six months,

40:23.300 --> 40:24.400
I'll make her mine.

40:24.766 --> 40:25.700
And in a year,

40:26.300 --> 40:27.333
you'll attend our wedding.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.366
You psycho.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.733
I'm very disturbed right now.
Stop annoying me,

40:31.800 --> 40:32.833
and go to sleep.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.400
Gosh, you little brat.

40:38.066 --> 40:39.900
Are you still not over that gold digger?

40:41.066 --> 40:42.200
Hey,

40:42.366 --> 40:44.433
I'll treat you to something nice.
Let's go out.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.333
You don't want to? Fine.

41:08.833 --> 41:09.866
You said let's go out.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.066
Step one.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.200
Step two.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.166
Hey! Wait, stop, stop.

41:48.266 --> 41:49.266
What is it now?

41:49.533 --> 41:51.200
We were ordered to stand by
in the barrack.

41:51.633 --> 41:52.900
Aren't you a bit apprehensive?

41:54.266 --> 41:56.233
I like you because you're so fickle.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.433
But if we get caught,

41:59.866 --> 42:01.233
we'll be locked up in the guardhouse.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.966
It was you who woke me up
and suggested that we go out.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.200
Okay. Fine.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.233
I feel like it was a dream.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.600
Was she that hot?

42:20.333 --> 42:23.266
I think I'll never be able to meet
someone like her ever again.

42:23.433 --> 42:24.333
I'm serious.

42:27.866 --> 42:28.866
What are you laughing at?

42:29.566 --> 42:30.533
Hey,

42:30.800 --> 42:31.966
I just met

42:32.233 --> 42:34.366
such a woman.

42:34.766 --> 42:35.900
You met yours in your dreams,

42:35.966 --> 42:38.000
but mine is real.

42:39.966 --> 42:40.966
Gosh.

42:41.066 --> 42:41.966
Fine.

42:42.033 --> 42:44.433
I'll hook you up with one
in the same league tonight.

42:44.500 --> 42:45.666
Gosh.

42:45.833 --> 42:46.766
No, thanks.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.266
Hey, pick one.

43:14.566 --> 43:16.500
I'll help you tonight.

43:24.433 --> 43:25.700
They're just your type.

43:26.733 --> 43:27.700
You brat.

43:34.733 --> 43:36.766
Hey, hey. Look at her.

43:37.233 --> 43:38.300
The one next to the pillar.

43:38.900 --> 43:40.066
Wow.

43:40.833 --> 43:41.800
Yes.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.366
Not really my type.

43:45.433 --> 43:48.400
Gosh, you're so unnecessarily picky.

43:49.433 --> 43:53.100
You don't even deserve her.

43:57.833 --> 43:58.900
Hey, hey.

43:58.966 --> 43:59.800
Wait here.

44:06.433 --> 44:08.133
Grow up. Gosh.

44:16.833 --> 44:18.533
I'm with my friend

44:19.133 --> 44:21.133
over there.
Why don't you have a drink with us?

44:29.233 --> 44:30.233
I'm sorry.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.566
Damn it. Open your damn eyes.

44:37.433 --> 44:38.400
What are you looking at?

44:38.866 --> 44:39.800
What now?

44:40.366 --> 44:42.400
I opened my eyes because you said so.

44:45.633 --> 44:46.933
Are you kidding me?

44:52.066 --> 44:54.466
When a grown-up says sorry,
just shut your mouth.

45:00.433 --> 45:01.900
Behave yourself.

45:01.966 --> 45:04.100
And mind your manners
with the ladies here, you jerk.

45:09.866 --> 45:10.933
It's nice to meet you.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.566
Let's have a drink.

45:22.966 --> 45:24.166
Where are you going?

45:26.200 --> 45:27.133
Gosh.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.400
You're back. Come sit here.

45:33.266 --> 45:35.066
-He's my friend.
-Hello.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.666
-This is Mi-suk Lim.
-Hello.

45:37.366 --> 45:38.733
She's very tall,

45:39.100 --> 45:40.333
and she used to be a model.

45:44.733 --> 45:45.700
Well...

45:46.666 --> 45:47.766
My friend

45:48.100 --> 45:49.966
grew up in the U.S.

45:50.533 --> 45:52.533
He doesn't really understand Korean.

45:55.433 --> 45:56.433
Are you okay?

45:56.500 --> 45:57.366
I'm okay.

45:57.633 --> 45:58.700
Okay.

45:58.866 --> 45:59.766
Thank you.

46:27.233 --> 46:28.166
Well...

46:28.766 --> 46:30.000
Are you

46:30.266 --> 46:31.666
here with three friends?

46:35.033 --> 46:36.733
Do you live nearby then?

46:39.033 --> 46:39.900
Sa-woo, run.

46:49.700 --> 46:51.366
That jerk. Damn it.

46:52.366 --> 46:53.266
Well,

46:54.333 --> 46:55.633
please pay our bill.

46:57.933 --> 46:59.033
Hey, stop that jerk!

47:01.166 --> 47:02.266
Stop right there, you jerk!

47:02.633 --> 47:03.500
Damn it!

47:04.966 --> 47:06.333
Hey, hurry up!

47:08.933 --> 47:10.066
Damn it, you idiot.

47:10.333 --> 47:11.600
Hey, wait for me!

47:14.233 --> 47:15.466
Hey, stop there!

47:42.133 --> 47:43.066
Damn it.

47:53.166 --> 47:54.333
Damn it.

47:56.633 --> 47:59.100
Are you trapped, you little rat?

47:59.666 --> 48:00.766
Gosh.

48:01.633 --> 48:02.633
Damn it.

48:02.700 --> 48:05.566
-You're going to get a kick in the face.
-How much should I spank you?

48:06.033 --> 48:07.733
Wait. Hold on.

48:08.533 --> 48:09.466
Let me catch my breath.

48:09.933 --> 48:11.233
You're so stupid.

48:12.266 --> 48:14.733
Damn it, how could that jerk
just leave me behind?

48:14.800 --> 48:16.500
Are you looking for someone?

48:17.500 --> 48:19.766
STRONG SOLDIER UNDER ORDERS

48:26.900 --> 48:29.066
You call yourself a lethal weapon.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.733
Yet, you picked a fight
with young students?

48:33.233 --> 48:34.966
They were not just young students

48:35.066 --> 48:37.666
but bulky athletes.

48:37.933 --> 48:39.233
I didn't fight with them.

48:40.366 --> 48:41.766
It was just a survival instinct--

48:41.833 --> 48:42.800
Shut up.

48:44.100 --> 48:45.033
For ten days,

48:45.700 --> 48:48.933
run 50 laps of training ground,
fully geared up.

48:49.100 --> 48:49.933
Sorry?

49:23.433 --> 49:24.333
Sa-woo!

49:26.466 --> 49:27.333
Are you tired?

49:32.933 --> 49:33.933
You're such a jerk.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.233
Gosh.

49:45.533 --> 49:47.866
You coward.
How could you run away by yourself?

49:49.500 --> 49:51.233
Hey, please forgive me.

49:52.500 --> 49:53.933
I pity the guys in Bravo team

49:54.366 --> 49:57.100
who will carry out operations,
while fully trusting such a coward leader.

49:57.666 --> 50:01.066
I feel so sorry for them.

50:01.533 --> 50:02.766
You're really upset, aren't you?

50:03.033 --> 50:04.000
Get lost.

50:07.300 --> 50:08.233
You told me to get lost.

50:11.166 --> 50:12.000
Keep going.

50:12.366 --> 50:13.333
Damn it.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.333
Gosh, he's such a punk.

50:31.000 --> 50:31.833
What is it?

50:33.133 --> 50:34.200
It was my fault

50:34.766 --> 50:35.766
that Sa-woo got in trouble.

50:37.066 --> 50:38.133
Please forgive me.

50:40.866 --> 50:42.166
Why was it your fault?

50:42.766 --> 50:44.033
We sneaked out together.

50:44.766 --> 50:45.600
So?

50:45.766 --> 50:46.966
The fight...

50:48.100 --> 50:49.433
I actually started it, first.

50:55.300 --> 50:56.900
Are you out of your mind?

50:57.366 --> 50:59.866
What good is it to volunteer
and suffer this?

51:00.333 --> 51:02.433
Damn it. I didn't know
it would turn out this way.

51:03.166 --> 51:04.600
What are you raising your voice for?

51:05.266 --> 51:06.700
Be quiet already, damn it.

51:07.066 --> 51:07.933
What?

51:08.400 --> 51:09.766
What?

51:10.333 --> 51:11.166
Hey,

51:11.233 --> 51:12.633
I went to see the company commander

51:12.700 --> 51:14.166
to save you, you moron.

51:14.533 --> 51:16.666
I wouldn't have to suffer like this
if you didn't tell him!

51:16.733 --> 51:18.266
I didn't know it would turn out this way!

51:18.333 --> 51:19.533
Why on earth did you tell him?

51:19.700 --> 51:21.133
I did it for you!

51:21.200 --> 51:23.733
For me? You just made it worse!

51:24.000 --> 51:24.900
Gosh.

51:25.066 --> 51:26.266
Start pulling it!

51:26.333 --> 51:27.433
You  pull it.

51:29.200 --> 51:31.333
Damn it, pull it harder!

51:33.700 --> 51:35.033
Damn it.

52:03.533 --> 52:05.033
Close the door already.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.566
What brings you here, sir?

52:48.733 --> 52:49.900
Where are we heading to?

53:25.900 --> 53:27.500
PERSONAL RECORD

54:56.633 --> 54:57.600
Get changed.

55:38.133 --> 55:39.033
Sa-woo.

55:39.700 --> 55:40.533
Sa-woo Jin.

55:40.700 --> 55:41.600
Wait,

55:41.666 --> 55:42.966
what is this place for?

55:43.266 --> 55:44.466
Shut up and follow me!

55:57.666 --> 55:58.700
Where am I?

55:58.966 --> 56:00.066
Who are you?

56:00.766 --> 56:02.600
Tell me why you're doing this to me!

56:07.100 --> 56:08.033
What is this?

56:08.300 --> 56:09.966
What did you just do...

56:10.233 --> 56:11.233
You...

56:19.200 --> 56:20.366
TTX injected.

56:20.533 --> 56:22.666
He is starting to show muscle contractions
and dyspnea.

56:35.566 --> 56:36.966
What did you...

56:37.266 --> 56:38.366
Sa-woo Ji.

56:39.266 --> 56:42.566
You will answer my questions.

56:48.433 --> 56:49.900
I can't breathe.

56:51.866 --> 56:53.200
Tell me about the operation area

56:53.266 --> 56:54.733
and what the operation is about.

56:55.200 --> 56:58.233
ECG, EMG and EKG checked.

56:59.333 --> 57:00.600
All readings are reacting

57:00.933 --> 57:02.500
to the TTX within the normal ranges.

57:11.266 --> 57:12.233
Tell me about the progress.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.100
We injected 0.1mg of TTX.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.966
Inject him with pentothal in an hour.

57:19.033 --> 57:20.000
Yes, sir.

57:45.666 --> 57:47.533
You better keep in mind

57:48.233 --> 57:50.366
that the most painful part
hasn't even begun yet.

57:58.600 --> 57:59.566
Pentothal.

58:01.233 --> 58:02.366
Inject him with pentothal.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.033
Pentothal injected.

58:13.300 --> 58:14.266
Check his condition.

58:14.633 --> 58:15.900
The EKG readings went down.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.366
Dilatation of pupils confirmed.

58:43.133 --> 58:44.700
If his body reacts to pentothal normally,

58:44.966 --> 58:46.600
he'll find it hard to open his eyes.

58:47.066 --> 58:49.666
But please take a look at the results
of his EGG and the lie-detector.

58:51.033 --> 58:53.133
All variables are
within the normal ranges.

58:56.333 --> 58:59.266
He's perfectly controlling his emotions.

59:03.833 --> 59:05.200
Increase the pentothal dosage.

59:05.633 --> 59:06.600
Are you sure?

59:06.866 --> 59:07.766
Do it.

1:00:18.133 --> 1:00:19.100
I'm going to ask you again.

1:00:20.866 --> 1:00:21.900
What is your mission

1:00:23.633 --> 1:00:25.866
in the current operation?

1:00:30.566 --> 1:00:31.733
Surrender, Hyun-jun Kim.

1:00:33.766 --> 1:00:35.333
You're just making it hard on yourself.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:37.733
If we overdose you,

1:00:39.033 --> 1:00:40.133
you're going to die.

1:01:03.066 --> 1:01:06.100
Secure the interrogation room
and release the tranquilizing gas.

1:01:06.166 --> 1:01:07.166
Leave him.

1:01:44.300 --> 1:01:45.866
Welcome to the NSS.

1:01:46.633 --> 1:01:47.666
Where am I?

1:01:47.866 --> 1:01:51.233
Let's just say this is where people defeat
the enemies that threaten the nation.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:52.700
Yamamoto Takashi.

1:01:52.766 --> 1:01:55.166
He's Japanese with Syrian citizenship.

1:01:55.700 --> 1:01:58.633
This will be the first official mission.
for agents Hyun-jun Kim and Sa-woo Jin,

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:09.766
-Please take a shower first.
-Why don't we do it together?

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.300
This is a perfect device

1:02:13.366 --> 1:02:14.966
that's capable of wireless transmission.

1:02:17.766 --> 1:02:19.033
Please track the GPS coordinates.

1:02:19.666 --> 1:02:21.200
Find out Takashi's possible escape routes.

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:23.766
Target identified. Target identified.

1:02:27.266 --> 1:02:29.966
Once I set my mind to it,
I never lose my target.

1:02:30.433 --> 1:02:31.300
Myung-ho Cho?

1:02:31.666 --> 1:02:33.533
He's the front runner
in the presidential election.

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:35.166
MYUNG-HO CHO

1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:37.933
TK1, TK2, Code EX.

1:02:38.566 --> 1:02:41.066
The center window on the top floor
of the building across the street!
