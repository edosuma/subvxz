01:18.560 --> 01:19.834
Go on!

01:34.280 --> 01:36.176
Seem a little lonely. Need some company?

01:36.200 --> 01:37.576
Make some time for you, little missy.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.989
- Yeah!
- Come on, move! Get out of the way!

01:40.120 --> 01:41.678
- Hurry.
- Quickly.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.440
Hurry.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.519
- Move it!
- Come on, come on!

01:46.600 --> 01:49.068
- Get out of the way, now!
- Come on.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.554
Fire in the hole!

01:58.880 --> 02:01.189
Another wagon coming from town!

02:01.280 --> 02:03.350
That's Mr. Bogue's gold!

02:03.440 --> 02:05.078
Hyah! Hyah!

02:09.280 --> 02:10.952
Hyah!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.471
Move. Get out of the way!

02:19.480 --> 02:20.708
Out of the road!

02:20.800 --> 02:22.199
This gold's heavy.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.874
- Must be a lot in there.
- You folks stay back!

02:24.960 --> 02:26.712
Stay away from the gold!

02:26.800 --> 02:28.776
- Get right inside. You, get up there!
- Get going!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.313
There's more gold in the wagon.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.070
Hurry up. Get the rest of those cases.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.833
Ain't right how these
men are being treated.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.399
They fought in the war.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.358
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Line your asses up and get paid.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.471
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go! Move!

02:50.600 --> 02:52.431
- All right, boys, line up.
- Move. Come on!

02:52.520 --> 02:54.351
Get that wagon back to the mine.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.274
Let's move! Move!

03:08.360 --> 03:09.588
What about our water?

03:09.680 --> 03:12.877
Bogue's gonna come back,
and he's gonna try and take this land.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.016
- What about our families?
- What about Bogue?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.632
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

03:16.800 --> 03:18.233
Our crops are dying!

03:18.320 --> 03:19.920
He's telling us that the water's poison?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.080
- It's a lie!
- It is a lie.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.616
Otherwise, why does he have Blackstones
keeping us away from it?

03:23.640 --> 03:26.120
- He's just a man, Turner.
- He's a man with an army, Phillips!

03:26.160 --> 03:29.096
- He's a man with a claim to mine a mountain.
- He's trying to run us out of town.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.936
And his miners are camping
on the edge of our town!

03:30.960 --> 03:32.440
A man seizing our land.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.631
A man with dozens of hired guns
on his payroll.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
We know that, Turner.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.189
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that?
- We will.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.616
- But how? With what?
- We're just farmers.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.834
To Bogue?

03:42.880 --> 03:45.161
- There are laws on our side.
- Bogue is the law, Matthew.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.475
Bought and paid for.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.456
- Even got our sheriff on his payroll!
- And his deputies.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.153
- And that's why I say we fight.
- I say we fight. Yeah.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.896
I ain't fighting,
and I ain't leaving neither.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.776
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- God will provide.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.856
That is right, Brother Phillip.
The Lord surely will provide.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.269
Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.616
If you just reason with him...

04:00.640 --> 04:01.993
...he'll give you a fair share.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.275
- Oh, yeah. Right. Sure he will.
- Fair share, Gavin?

04:04.360 --> 04:05.998
You're the only one making money here!

04:06.080 --> 04:08.469
No, you and your whores.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.715
Now, Ben, that ain't fair.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.496
You know that.
You were there the other night.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.873
You know that's a lie now, Gavin!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.281
- Please, brothers and sisters...
- You know that's a lie.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.077
- Please, brothers and sisters.
- Reason?

04:20.399 --> 04:22.595
Ask the Dennehys
how far reasoning got them.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.736
He burned all the Dennehys' crops!

04:23.760 --> 04:25.352
- Our farms are rotting.
- That's right.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.736
It's only a matter of time
before he drives all of us out of here.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.876
For the sake of our children,

04:30.360 --> 04:32.794
I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.336
- To where?
- And where are we gonna go?

04:34.360 --> 04:36.336
- I know you're scared.
- I've given everything I have.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.193
We all are, but we came far to get here.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.794
Suffered losses too painful to bear
to make this our home.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.154
- Praise God.
- Amen.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
We did it.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.029
All of us.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.748
Together.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.075
This valley is ours.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.880
- I agree with Matthew.
- I'm with Matthew.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.279
This is the Lord's house.
It's no place for guns.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.277
There are women and children.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.798
Shh.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.239
Oh!

05:34.320 --> 05:35.514
Mr. Bogue.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.911
This is what you love, what you'd die for.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.033
And what your children

05:55.360 --> 05:58.318
and your children's children
will work on, suffer for,

05:58.440 --> 06:00.510
be consumed by.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.997
Look at me, boy. Come on up here.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.711
Come on, boy. Come on!

06:21.680 --> 06:23.477
It's okay, son.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.397
Now, I come here for gold.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.639
Gold.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.874
This country has long equated democracy
with capitalism,

06:36.720 --> 06:38.551
capitalism with God.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.279
So you're standing not only in
the way of progress and capital.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.351
You're standing in the way of God!

06:45.640 --> 06:48.154
- And for what? Hmm?
- No, preacher.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.069
You want to help me out?

06:50.760 --> 06:52.318
Let's find out.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.237
Put your hand in there for me.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.075
Go on.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
Go on.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.478
Land.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.198
This is no longer land.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.793
The moment I put a pin in the map,

07:19.880 --> 07:22.189
the day I descended
into this godforsaken valley

07:22.280 --> 07:23.679
and cast my gaze upon it,

07:23.760 --> 07:26.877
it ceased to be land and became...

07:29.280 --> 07:30.480
That's it. Pull your hand out.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.913
Dust.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.948
Go on, sit back down.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.232
This is your God?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.234
$20 for each parcel of dust,
that is my offer.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.056
- My land is worth three times that!
- You can't do that.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.116
We have to think of our families.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.376
This valley's worth more than that.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.296
- You're stealing our land!
- And our livelihood.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.799
It won't sweeten.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.232
It'll only sour.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.936
- They're coming in!
- Everybody on out!

08:02.960 --> 08:04.188
Get out of here! Go on!

08:04.280 --> 08:06.157
What are you doing? This is God's house.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.751
Both of you! Stay here!

08:10.840 --> 08:13.752
You're not going anywhere. Stay here!

08:13.840 --> 08:15.558
No, no, no!

08:15.680 --> 08:17.477
- No, please, no!
- Get down.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.391
Somebody help her. Come on. Come on.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.078
- Get out!
- It's the Lord's house!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.277
- Move!
- Get the hell out of here!

08:28.840 --> 08:30.592
No! Don't!

08:31.280 --> 08:32.474
Please!

08:32.600 --> 08:35.193
Do not turn your back on the Lord.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.751
Please stop.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.576
- Please, stop it!
- Leave him alone!

08:39.600 --> 08:40.736
Stay down, preacher!

08:40.760 --> 08:44.035
- I'll return to Rose Creek in three weeks.
- Stop moving.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.190
Those of you who accept my offer,

08:46.280 --> 08:48.840
whose signed deeds are on my desk
when I return...

08:48.960 --> 08:50.837
- Matthew!
- ...shall get their $20.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
Get off him!

08:52.040 --> 08:53.792
Those of you who do not,

08:54.280 --> 08:56.236
may your good Lord help you.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.599
I'll help you. I'm sorry. Let me help you.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.159
The Lord's watching.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.120
What kind of man are you?

09:10.320 --> 09:12.709
What'd these people ever do to you? Huh?

09:13.800 --> 09:15.552
For what, Bogue?

09:16.320 --> 09:17.514
For land?

09:18.480 --> 09:19.708
For land?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.515
No!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.831
Matthew!

09:50.200 --> 09:51.235
Isabel, no!

09:53.040 --> 09:54.598
Son of a bitch.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.790
- No, Caleb!
- Oh, my God.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.836
Down, down! Stay down.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.713
No, no.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.709
No!

10:14.880 --> 10:16.791
Leave the bodies where they lay

10:17.920 --> 10:19.320
and let 'em look at 'em a few days.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.277
No!

10:21.360 --> 10:23.271
- My God.
- No!

10:23.800 --> 10:27.110
No! No!

10:28.640 --> 10:30.198
Caleb.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.191
Please, God, don't take him.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.096
Come on, Leni. We have to
get the baby away from the church.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.856
- It's on fire. Come on, come on, come on.
- No, no.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.269
Come on, come with us. Come on, Leni.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.277
This is the Lord's house.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.616
- Come on, there's a fire!
- Something's on fire!

10:41.640 --> 10:44.518
- Let's put it out, men. We can't leave this!
- Shit, it's on fire!

10:44.600 --> 10:46.096
It'll be burned to the ground
if we don't hurry!

10:46.120 --> 10:47.473
- Stay back!
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.993
- Stay back.
- Stay back, men!

10:49.080 --> 10:50.376
Come on, we're just trying to help.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.914
You don't get paid to help. Move!

10:56.920 --> 10:58.433
- I can't.
- I'm fine.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.551
Come on. Come on. Come with us.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.839
Damn wheel's busted. I can't fix it!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.359
Got a long ride ahead of us.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.349
Well, lookee there.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.797
You know where you are, cowboy?

13:34.520 --> 13:36.397
Oh, get right here. Get right here.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.591
Yeah, I'm hoping to change my luck.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.069
- These cards are shit.
- Deal.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.598
Now, let's try to keep
civil this round, okay?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.199
I'm looking at you, Lucas.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.033
Just play the damn game, Faraday.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.440
What the hell is he doing here?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.914
Shot of busthead.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.837
Sorry, don't carry that kind, cowboy.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.030
Well, in that case, I'll have a double.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.960
- What's that for?
- Information.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.271
Looking for a man. Big fella.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.634
'Bout your size.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.200
What's his name?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.312
Name his mama gave him
was, uh, Daniel Harrison,

15:20.440 --> 15:23.034
but sometimes
he goes by the name of Powder Dan.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.874
Killed a tenant farmer
and his son in cold blood.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.393
Stole the man's plow horse.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.075
Man's wife tried to intervene.
Took advantage, then killed her, too.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.518
- Ain't heard of him.
- Well, like I said, he use different names.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.428
Had a bullet scar on his,
uh, left shoulder.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.948
Right there.

15:42.120 --> 15:46.432
Now, Powder Dan ran with an outlaw,
name of July Bully.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.794
May he rest in peace.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.958
- He's dead?
- Yes, sir.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
How'd he die?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.360
I whispered in his ear.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.955
Yeah, what's that?

15:56.760 --> 15:57.795
Come here.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.551
Bring them in

16:09.640 --> 16:10.959
Bring them in

16:12.040 --> 16:14.474
From the fields of sin

16:15.840 --> 16:18.513
Bring them in

16:30.920 --> 16:32.512
He shot my damn foot!

16:39.480 --> 16:43.189
Come on, hey. Settle down, mister. Come on.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.471
Come on, easy.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.709
I got a family, mister.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.631
They're better off without you.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.151
Somebody fetch the sheriff.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.576
- Get the sheriff!
- Get the sheriff.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.715
- Get the sheriff!
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.832
I'm gonna kill you, Faraday.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.229
You son of a bitch. Deal with you later.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.680
- Well, I know it.
- Go on out.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.715
Come on, come on.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.112
Dan, you dead?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.872
Pity. I had just ordered a drink from him.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.550
Money for blood's a peculiar business.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.600
He started shooting
everyone in cold blood!

18:12.760 --> 18:14.656
- And he's still in there, yeah.
- That son of a bitch!

18:14.680 --> 18:15.874
- There he is!
- There he is!

18:15.960 --> 18:17.234
- That's him!
- That's him!

18:17.320 --> 18:18.896
- Sheriff! Sheriff!
- He shot him in cold blood!

18:18.920 --> 18:20.478
My name is Sam Chisolm.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.712
I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
of the circuit court in Wichita, Kansas.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.518
I'm also a licensed peace officer

18:26.600 --> 18:30.309
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas,
Nebraska, and seven other states.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.189
Now, this man is wanted on charges
in Nebraska,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.872
expedited by federal writ,

18:36.680 --> 18:38.750
under Common State Law Enforcement Act.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.753
Yes, sir.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.070
Wire Judge Talbot in
Wichita for the reward.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.798
Half the money goes to the man's widow.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.474
And you can hold my part for me
till I get back.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
Where you headed?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.317
Off into the mountains, hunting a vaquero.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.832
No, Miss Emma. I'll do it.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.436
- Excuse me. Are you a bounty hunter, sir?
- No, sir.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.696
Yeah, that's Powder Dan.
Get him on outta here.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.915
I have need of a man with
your qualifications.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.274
You can't afford me.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.193
Well, can you at least describe the rates
or offer up the particulars?

19:18.360 --> 19:20.430
Rose Creek.
It's only four days' ride from here.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.637
A rich man has overtaken the town.
He's killed half a dozen men.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.679
He's got the sheriff on his payroll
and Blackstone agents in his employ.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.399
Well, you don't need a bounty hunter,
you need an army.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.317
And we intend to hire one, sir.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.236
Guess you weren't expecting
to see me again, were ya?

19:46.160 --> 19:49.277
Wild Bill? Is that you? You look like shit.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.078
Ain't no Wild Bill.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.073
They call me

19:54.080 --> 19:55.718
the Two Gun Kid.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.936
Keep your hands away
from your weapons, Faraday.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.554
- Hands up. Hands up.
- Hands away from the...

20:01.840 --> 20:03.273
Get his guns, Dicky.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.199
Don't try nothing.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.750
Oh, a pretty one.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.676
What's that, a Peacemaker?

20:10.760 --> 20:12.318
Now turn around.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.233
I'm not for sale.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.476
Mister. Mister!

20:19.280 --> 20:21.032
You intend to make me chase?

20:21.960 --> 20:23.279
I have a proposition.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.113
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss.
- Missus.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.239
I'm not sure if my friend
filled you in on the details.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.389
Enough of 'em.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.830
Then why won't you at least listen?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.115
We're simple farmers.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.636
Decent, hard-working people
being driven from our homes.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.597
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.193
Women and children
without food or essentials.

20:45.280 --> 20:49.114
All because some man named Bogue wants
to mine our valley and take it from us.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.429
Bartholomew Bogue?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.589
You know of him?

20:53.880 --> 20:55.233
Heard the name.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.958
What's this?

21:05.440 --> 21:06.998
Everything we have.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.632
That's what it's worth to us.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.515
Been offered a lot for my work
but never everything.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.190
That man murdered my husband.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.870
Killed him dead in the
middle of the street.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.514
So you seek revenge.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.355
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.711
But I'll take revenge.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.318
The Two Gun Kid.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.038
That's my name now.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.348
'Cause you got two guns?

21:44.440 --> 21:46.396
- Maybe not.
- Told you it was a stupid name.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.277
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.759
Faraday, walk!

21:50.000 --> 21:52.195
Just mad 'cause Mama gave him
the name Earl.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.880
What do you want to do with him?

21:53.920 --> 21:56.354
How 'bout we take him over
into that mine there?

21:56.960 --> 21:58.598
- Uh...
- Whoa.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.591
This is as good a place as any.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.749
Into the mine, Faraday.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.200
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.759
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.711
But I will not go in that mine.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.873
There's rats in there.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.794
Virginia City? Three days past?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.632
Best you remember who'd you cheat
out of $50 in a card game!

22:15.720 --> 22:19.110
I assure you I did not have to cheat
to beat the likes of you two.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Easy.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.719
Gentlemen, allow me a moment
to show you something quite miraculous.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.309
You just show us our money, Faraday!

22:28.400 --> 22:29.549
Fifty-two cards.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.108
- Pick a card.
- We ain't playing no game.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.794
You've got the drop on me.
You'll get a hoot outta this.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.616
Come on, Earl,
just pick one real quick.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.517
You know how I like magic.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.634
- All right, keep the gun on him.
- Got it trained right on him.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.399
No tricks now.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.954
Don't let me see it.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.600
Show your associate.
Commit the card to memory.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.109
When you're ready,
put the card back in the deck.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.359
Don't try nothing.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.640
Keep your gun on me.
That's very good, Earl.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.836
Now, there's no way
I can know what your card is

22:59.920 --> 23:01.239
because I didn't see it.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.030
- Yet...
- Come on. Let's go!

23:04.240 --> 23:07.755
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

23:09.680 --> 23:10.874
your card.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.554
That ain't his card.
Man, you ain't no magic man.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.675
That's not it? Hold on.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.513
Quit playing around
before I blow your goddamn head off.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.115
Oh, remember the plan, Earl.
I get to kill him.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.239
You didn't let me finish.

23:23.760 --> 23:27.673
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.352
Is this your card?

23:32.440 --> 23:34.192
Now, you see? That was worth it, wasn't it?

23:34.280 --> 23:35.696
- That was kind of good.
- Pretty good.

23:35.720 --> 23:36.869
That was...

23:38.800 --> 23:42.588
No, you just killed my brother. Huh?

23:42.680 --> 23:45.035
- Should I kill you?
- No. Please.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.350
Would you like to see another magic trick?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.028
No.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
Yeah.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.719
It's called The Incredible...

23:51.800 --> 23:53.153
No.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.637
Disappearing...

23:59.160 --> 24:00.195
Ear.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.360
Oh, my ear!

24:07.640 --> 24:12.077
We are never gonna cross paths again.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.040
Please don't kill me.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.159
Keep your money, please.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.234
I didn't want to kill him.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.917
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.392
The only way in is the valley floor,

24:50.480 --> 24:53.438
and the main road in and
out is to the west.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.919
Where's the mine?

24:55.560 --> 24:56.629
Here.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.790
- And where's Bogue?
- Sacramento.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.711
Back in less than three weeks.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.230
And how many men you say
you got left in town?

25:04.320 --> 25:05.469
Forty, maybe.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.634
Farmers. Not fighters.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.856
You understand what it means
when you start something like this?

25:11.880 --> 25:14.235
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.398
Whoa!

25:22.680 --> 25:25.433
What are you waiting on?
Just get him under control.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.516
Spend all night at the saloon,
and then you can't even control a silly horse.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.431
Come on, lad, get in there!

25:31.520 --> 25:33.317
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.312
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,
so he oughta be careful.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.630
- Easy, easy, easy!
- I require my horse back.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.240
That horse.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.551
Two days past.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.995
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.150
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.358
That, sir, is a lie.
A complete, absolute...

25:53.640 --> 25:54.868
Good Lord.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.416
- Easy.
- I thought that was a dream.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.715
I thought you were a leprechaun.
That was real?

25:58.800 --> 26:02.429
Uh, I was mistaken.
I would like to buy my horse back.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.273
Though I am light of funds at the moment.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.714
So...

26:08.560 --> 26:10.516
Seems we have ourselves
a Mexican standoff,

26:10.600 --> 26:14.070
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,
and I'm not sure how that ends.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.469
With you walking away

26:17.280 --> 26:18.599
without your horse.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.188
Now, why'd you have to go
and touch your gun for?

26:24.240 --> 26:26.674
We were in the middle
of a gentlemen's negotiation.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.875
Come on!

26:34.240 --> 26:35.456
How much for his horse?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.352
$25 for the horse.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.237
Seven and two bits for the saddle.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.197
Our paths cross again.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.399
To what do I owe the pleasure?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.754
Come on.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.990
Took a job. Looking for
some men to join me.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.229
Is there money in it?

27:03.520 --> 27:04.589
And who's she?

27:05.200 --> 27:06.269
Joan of Arc.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.593
My name's Emma Cullen.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.389
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.550
Well, I do have an
affinity for shiny things.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.315
- Is it difficult?
- Impossible.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.949
- How many you got so far?
- Two.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.429
- What, them?
- You and me.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.151
Sending a woman to gather guns
is not very chivalrous.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.312
I volunteered.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.758
Insisted, actually.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.236
Lot of fire in that one.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.833
Begs the question.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.556
Whose execution do we seek?

28:20.440 --> 28:22.112
Bartholomew Bogue.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.431
Bart Bogue? The robber baron?

28:27.520 --> 28:28.896
Means there's gold in the equation,

28:28.920 --> 28:30.936
but gold don't do you much good
when you're buried with it.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.640
You want out, feel free to leave.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.869
Just leave my horse.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.068
'Cause I paid for it.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.235
Just speaking out loud.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.034
Twenty miles east of here.
Volcano Springs. Supply station.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.192
You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.271
- Goodnight Robicheaux?
- That's right.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.360
The Angel of Death.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.590
Meet me outside of Junction City
in three days.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.961
Yeah, I ain't there,
then it means I'm dead and you can...

28:53.480 --> 28:54.515
You can keep my horse.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.918
You're with me. Come on, let's go.
Come on. Hyah!

29:01.080 --> 29:02.354
Three days.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.232
The gun. The gun!

30:24.600 --> 30:26.192
Give it to him.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.198
He was already dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.114
- You been sleeping in here?
- He doesn't snore much.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.515
- You Vasquez?
- What's this to you?

30:45.600 --> 30:48.239
Here. I'm gonna tear up a warrant.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.440
I just want to make sure
I'm talking to the right man.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.829
- No.
- Shh, shh.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.392
Poor likeness.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.549
You a bounty hunter?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.278
Duly sworn warrant officer.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.589
Where is your gun?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.671
Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.310
Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.674
Maybe he had it coming.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.016
Doesn't matter to me either way.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.635
- Why? You intend to get that reward?
- That depends.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.598
Got a business proposition for you.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.994
Well, does this business involve her?

31:21.440 --> 31:22.998
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.594
- Get me out of here! Let me out of here!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.110
You wipe that smile off your face.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.230
Oh, laugh now. Get it outta your system.

31:33.760 --> 31:37.514
After our business is concluded, what then?

31:37.600 --> 31:39.511
There'll still be a lot
of men after your hide.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.477
- And that should give me comfort?
- Should.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.599
I won't be one of 'em.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.113
You're loco, my friend.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.640
Si.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.196
Hyah! Hyah!

32:21.000 --> 32:22.718
Hyah!

32:22.800 --> 32:24.279
Let me tell you the game.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.194
- Go on, now!
- Fastest gun wins.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.388
Winner take all.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.110
Hope you've all put your bets down.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.994
Arcade.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.279
Billy Rocks.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.352
On my gun.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.238
Whoo!

32:51.040 --> 32:52.440
Yeah, how about that, boys?

32:52.480 --> 32:54.160
- That's good.
- That was pretty good, huh?

32:55.360 --> 32:57.351
- Billy wins.
- What?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.556
Are you blind? Come on, Eddy.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.589
- You're a liar!
- Oh, come on, Arcade.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.956
- Hey, come on, we all saw me win, now.
- Yeah!

33:07.400 --> 33:09.216
- Double down!
- We all want some more!

33:09.240 --> 33:10.360
Why don't we do it for real?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.616
- Come on, Arcade, back off.
- No, no, double down.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.234
Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.436
I want no part of this.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.796
- Double or nothing!
- It's your funeral, Arcade.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.838
Double or nothing.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.554
He called it.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.038
Whoa!

33:43.240 --> 33:44.559
All right.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.073
He's lost his mind.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.800
- He ain't got a chance.
- It ain't right.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.080
Billy?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.149
On my gun.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.552
- Oh!
- Sh...

34:12.440 --> 34:14.016
- Never seen anything like this.
- What the hell was that?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.837
- Oh, come on, now.
- I think he killed him.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.295
- He killed him, right?
- What the hell?

34:17.320 --> 34:19.356
Damn!

34:20.199 --> 34:21.239
Damn it, Arcade.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.918
- Man, he got it.
- What was that?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.072
- Damn!
- See? I told you. I told you!

34:33.400 --> 34:35.868
I ain't in the habit of
paying off cheaters.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.598
I'll be keeping my money.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.438
Easy, Goodnight. He's drunk.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.678
He don't mean it.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.955
Mr. Robicheaux,
if I'd known it was you, that was your man,

34:48.040 --> 34:50.040
I never would've made
such a disrespectful comment.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.552
It's all right, son.
You just pay me double.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.119
Yes, sir.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.470
- Damn fool.
- Goodnight Robicheaux?

35:04.160 --> 35:05.957
Sam Chisolm sent us.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.518
- All right, get him outta here.
- That's gotta be real rough.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.480
I said,
what do you think I'm paying for?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.877
"Duly sworn warrant officer

35:19.960 --> 35:22.474
"from Wichita, Kansas,
and seven other states."

35:22.840 --> 35:26.196
- Do we have the same man?
- Yeah, believe we do.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.396
Should we talk somewhere more private?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.590
Nah, I like it right here.
Billy, you like it here?

35:30.680 --> 35:32.511
Oh, yeah.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.596
- How'd y'all meet?
- Ooh, how did we meet, Billy?

35:39.680 --> 35:43.070
I was serving a warrant on him
for the Northern Pacific Railroad.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.270
Warrant for what?
Killing a man with a hairpin?

35:49.400 --> 35:51.436
Now, now,
you're gonna have to pay for that.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.949
That is funny.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.837
Here's what it is.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.708
I found Billy
down in an old redneck saloon in Texas,

36:01.800 --> 36:02.856
and all these good ol' boys,

36:02.880 --> 36:05.474
they didn't want to serve
Billy's kind, all right?

36:05.600 --> 36:10.071
So this, uh, petite son of a bitch
took on the whole room bare-knuckled.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.197
I watched in awe, and I said to myself,

36:13.280 --> 36:17.193
"Goodnight, this is not a man to arrest,
this is a man to befriend."

36:17.560 --> 36:21.314
- You make your living off of his alley fights?
- Equal shares.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.717
Between fights, Goody helps me
navigate the white man's prejudices.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.835
Mmm-hmm.

36:25.920 --> 36:30.152
I keep him employed,
and he keeps me on the level.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.880
Well, Mr. Chisolm told
us to come fetch you,

36:32.960 --> 36:35.136
but he didn't say anything
about your friend over there.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.230
Wherever I go, Billy goes.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.035
Yes, sir.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
We understand each other.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.628
Well, day-and-a-half ride
to Junction City. We got two days.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.915
Let's do a half day of drinking.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.757
I like you.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.912
Ha-ha-ha!

37:23.000 --> 37:25.560
- Sam Chisolm!
- Goodnight Robicheaux.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.513
Oh, sight to see,
even with a storm on our backs.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.073
Yeah. Rain ain't nothing but wet.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.754
Well, what we lose in the fire
we will find in the ashes.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.910
That's right.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Oh, yeah.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.351
- Ah...
- This is Billy Rocks. He's with me.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.670
Sam, uh, that's Billy.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.399
He come with Goodnight.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.440
I don't know about this one.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.160
Who's this?

37:52.040 --> 37:53.632
- We work for her.
- Uh-huh.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.198
Well, enchanté, mon cher.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.234
- Emma Cullen.
- Your hands are cold, Emma.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.673
Are you nervous?

38:04.400 --> 38:05.958
Don't be.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.268
Goodnight's my name.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.113
That Billy is pretty nifty
with them pigstickers.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.398
Oh, good, we got a Mexican.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.952
Oh... yippee, yippee, yippee, ándale.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.791
Oh? Ooh, oh...

38:22.880 --> 38:24.199
Olé, muchacho.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.953
What a merry band we are.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.197
Me a gray, Chisolm a blue,

38:36.280 --> 38:38.510
Billy, a mysterious man of the Orient,

38:38.920 --> 38:40.148
a drunk Irishman,

38:40.240 --> 38:42.151
a Texican,

38:42.240 --> 38:44.470
a female and her gentleman caller.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.950
This is not going to end well.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.557
I'm Mexican, cabrón.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.148
No such thing as a "Texican."

38:54.240 --> 38:56.231
Try telling that to my granddaddy.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.871
He died at the Alamo.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.157
New Orleans Greys, long barracks, bayonets.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.390
Blood. Teeth.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.313
Mauled by a horde of teeming brown devils.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.677
My grandfather was one of those devils,
you know.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.352
Toluca Battalion.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.510
Hey. Maybe my grandfather
killed your grandfather, huh?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.431
Mmm, what a charming thought.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.470
I sense we are bonding.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.911
So we're talking about the same Jack Horne.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.195
The Jack Horne. The legend Jack Horne.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.350
Legend? Legend, my ass.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.317
Yeah, he might've killed 300 Crow,

39:35.400 --> 39:37.391
but he ain't never met
the Pigeon brothers before.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.556
And you saying that's Jack Horne's rifle?

39:40.120 --> 39:42.190
- It was Jack Horne's rifle.
- Uh-huh.

39:42.720 --> 39:46.952
And there's an Army fort
want to pay $1,000 for proof of death.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.269
Rifle'll do.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
You have no body?

39:50.840 --> 39:53.354
Well, you see, Len here
smashed a boulder over his head.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.200
Fell off a cliff.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.192
Snuck up on him, huh?

39:57.280 --> 39:59.635
Just what the hell
are you trying to imply?

40:05.080 --> 40:06.115
Oh, my Lord.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.040
Mmm.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.549
The Pigeon brothers
weren't famous very long.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.235
These two ungodly creatures

40:34.680 --> 40:36.272
broke a rock on my head.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.598
Robbed me of my possessions.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.432
I trailed 'em for two days.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.875
Guess they got
what they deserved, Mr. Horne. Uh...

40:44.520 --> 40:45.999
My name is Sam Chisolm.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.277
We met about six years ago up in Cheyenne.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.238
Now, I got a right,

40:57.320 --> 41:01.996
by the Lord and by the law,
to take back what belongs to me.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.239
Are we in agreement?

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
Yeah.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.200
Yes, sir.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.879
You still collecting scalps?

41:14.920 --> 41:18.117
The government don't pay
a bounty on redskins anymore.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.553
You must be out of work.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.840
Now, that's part of
another story, ain't it?

41:27.240 --> 41:28.719
Yes, it is.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.639
We, uh... We're looking
for some men, Mr. Horne,

41:33.760 --> 41:36.228
some good men like yourself, to do a job.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.993
Going after a fella,
name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.595
Just... Well, just thought
you'd be interested.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.036
I believe that bear
was wearing people's clothes.

42:24.760 --> 42:28.309
Never trust a people
who bury their dead above the ground.

42:28.440 --> 42:31.432
Don't call the alligator
"big mouth" till you cross the river.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.736
- Are you in the army?
- No, sir.

43:22.760 --> 43:27.788
I figured 'cause you carry this
army-issue Open Top.45 Long Colt.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.518
Took you for a soldier.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.440
You know how to shoot that thing?

43:31.520 --> 43:35.069
- If I had to, I reckon.
- If you had to?

43:36.120 --> 43:40.113
Tell you what, for a sip of your whiskey,
I'll teach you a few lessons.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.993
Lesson one.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.995
This

43:51.040 --> 43:52.553
means don't shoot.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.313
You got it?

43:56.400 --> 43:57.992
Now watch this one.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.040
Now, lesson two.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.358
Take this card out of my hand.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.715
You take the card, you live.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.392
You don't, you die.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.591
Come on, Teddy.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.993
Focus.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.118
You got to be quick.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.676
You just lost your first gunfight.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.878
Try it again.

44:39.720 --> 44:43.599
Lesson two. It was never about the cards.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.316
Now, I'll give you a third lesson.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.789
Think you need that more than I do.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.670
Why don't you just take the rest,
Mr. Faraday?

44:56.760 --> 44:58.079
Well, I think I will.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.038
Oh.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.156
The fire still burns.

45:17.800 --> 45:21.509
We have heard the chimes at midnight.
Have we not?

45:21.600 --> 45:23.830
So what's the play here, Sam, huh?

45:24.440 --> 45:25.475
What's the payout?

45:26.200 --> 45:27.872
Little gold, hmm?

45:27.960 --> 45:29.871
Cash money, hmm?

45:29.960 --> 45:30.960
Diamonds?

45:31.560 --> 45:32.560
You ain't changed.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.352
Everything that, uh...

45:37.760 --> 45:40.035
Everything they have,
that's what they offered.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.838
Everything? Yes?

45:43.640 --> 45:46.712
She's about the same age
your sister'd be by now, huh?

45:46.800 --> 45:48.153
Yeah, she is.

45:53.840 --> 45:57.515
Just making sure we're fighting
the battle in front of us, not behind.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.039
Smell that?

46:33.200 --> 46:34.792
What smell?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.600
- The smoke?
- It's blood.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.719
- He's been tracking us.
- I'll be damned.

46:57.400 --> 47:01.234
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.471
You are hallucinating.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.039
So am I.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.360
Where there's one,
there's more.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.040
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.916
Comanche?

47:27.920 --> 47:29.069
We come in peace.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.200
Vasquez.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.352
You speak Comanche?

47:41.440 --> 47:42.998
Some.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.513
You speak...

47:53.560 --> 47:56.074
...white man's English?

47:58.840 --> 47:59.840
Some.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.948
Where's your tribe? Huh?

48:05.120 --> 48:09.318
The elders told me my path is different.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.915
My path is different, too.
My path... Our path.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.151
We go to fight wicked men.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.399
Probably, we all die.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.677
I'm called Red Harvest.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.596
- What'd he say?
- Said he's with us.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.196
Gonna fix him some breakfast. I had mine.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.313
Let's get this fire started.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.157
- Mr. Paley, come on in.
- All right, sweetheart.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.958
Buy me a drink, sugar.

50:58.680 --> 51:00.272
Better get her all nailed down.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.240
I keep telling him.
He just don't listen.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.479
Kristen.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.200
Hyah. Come on!

51:16.160 --> 51:17.513
That man's trouble.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.993
Afternoon, gentlemen.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.310
Town's got a ban on firearms.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.795
Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.

52:15.880 --> 52:19.031
You don't mind me asking,
but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.552
These men are deputies.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.755
Awful lot of deputies
for such a small place, ain't it?

52:26.240 --> 52:27.240
What's his story?

52:28.520 --> 52:31.876
Ah. My, uh, manservant. He's harmless.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.116
Saved his life in Shanghai,

52:36.920 --> 52:38.478
debt of honor and the like.

52:39.640 --> 52:42.757
Now, you don't mind
giving up those guns, do you?

52:42.840 --> 52:45.308
Absolutely. Law and order, I say.

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
Sheriff?

53:00.280 --> 53:02.840
Now, I must tell you that
I'm more than happy to cooperate.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.673
I can't say the same thing
for my compadres behind you.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.356
Quite a batch of strays.

53:44.800 --> 53:48.952
I'll say a prayer for you.
You know, a little prayer.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.556
Yeah, you'll make a hell of a rug.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.319
And you'll be murdered

53:55.320 --> 53:57.993
by the world's greatest lover.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.678
All right.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.832
All right.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.799
What's your aim here, mister?

54:07.120 --> 54:08.473
Well...

54:09.680 --> 54:13.912
I hear that there are some cowards
running security here,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.992
so I figured we'd come down here
and look after all this gold.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.274
Cowards?

54:18.400 --> 54:21.312
Blackstone detective agents. Cowards.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.157
Now, Blackstones are good, union busting,

54:25.280 --> 54:28.955
back-shooting homesteaders
and women, but

54:29.040 --> 54:31.576
you put 'em up against some real men,
men that know what they're doing...

54:31.600 --> 54:33.192
You sure you don't want my gun?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.116
Now, you do know who we work for, right?

54:37.200 --> 54:41.193
The force he can bring to bear?

54:43.360 --> 54:44.873
You tell Bogue

54:46.120 --> 54:47.872
if he wants his town,

54:50.160 --> 54:51.513
come see me.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.554
I don't believe he heard you.

55:03.960 --> 55:04.960
Meh-koo!

55:49.280 --> 55:51.111
Go on, horse.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.949
No!

57:16.040 --> 57:17.871
Devil, don't shoot. I'm the proprietor.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.076
No!

57:33.520 --> 57:35.795
Lord, give me clear vision!

57:36.040 --> 57:37.314
Clear sight!

57:51.240 --> 57:52.912
Hyah!

58:39.880 --> 58:41.393
Hyah! Hyah!

59:07.640 --> 59:08.640
Hyah!

59:11.240 --> 59:12.240
Hyah! Hyah!

59:22.280 --> 59:23.793
Go on, shoot him.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.793
Take the shot.

59:26.840 --> 59:28.353
Take that shot.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.792
Take the damn shot!

59:41.720 --> 59:43.233
Give me that.

59:48.680 --> 59:49.715
It's jammed.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.079
How'd we do?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.759
I got five.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.632
- I got six.
- Hey.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.191
- What'd you get?
- Six.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.272
I got seven.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.680
You wanna try and tie it up?

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.312
Huh, chingado?

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.717
Say when, güero.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400
Hey.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.229
Come on out of there.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.551
Come on. Come on!

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.793
Take off that gun belt.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.194
You all right?

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.952
Nice and easy.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.839
Take off that badge, too.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.228
I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.231
Consider this a recall.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.958
Now, you're gonna deliver
a message to your boss.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.712
Mister, you already sent him a message,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.320
only you're not gonna like his answer.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.830
Tell him we have his town,
we have his whole valley.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.354
He want it back,
he's gonna have to make a deal with us.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.238
He don't make deals.
You can ask anybody here.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.517
He's just gonna send as many men
as it takes to squash you flat.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.680
We'll be waiting.
In the meantime, you tell him this.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.669
Lincoln. Like the president. Say it.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.432
Lincoln, like the president.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.556
That's right. Lincoln, Kansas.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.416
And you tell him if he
don't show up himself,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.318
he ain't nothing
but a yellow-bellied sapsucking coward.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600
Go on, git.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.028
Git.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.314
Hey.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.039
Sam Chisolm. Say it.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.111
Sam Chisolm.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.712
Yes, sir.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.796
Well, this is quite the welcome party.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.758
- Where is everybody?
- I think we killed 'em all.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.314
No, they're here.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.154
They just want to make sure their candle
is lit before they blow out the match.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.915
Everyone! Come on! Come out!

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.072
- Come out!
- Come on out, everybody!

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.552
What's the matter with y'all?

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.312
Don't you see what they just did?

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.636
Come on! Come out!

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.916
These men are here to help us!

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.152
- Come on!
- Well, look at that.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.840
- Come on!
- Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.195
- Come on!
- Is he dead?

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.952
Come on. Get away.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.235
It's okay.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.155
Come on, don't be afraid.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.358
I have assembled these men
and offered fair pay.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.074
Who picked you to deal on our behalf?

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.197
Seems I was the only one
with balls enough to do so.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.754
So I did.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.999
As I said, these men are here to help us.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.760
Mr. Chisolm?

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.670
Uh, my name is Sam Chisolm,

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.878
and, uh, I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
in Wichita, Kansas.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.995
Uh, also, a licensed peace officer

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.833
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas
and seven other states.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.559
Now, what happened here was

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.752
just an opening skirmish.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.432
The real battle is yet to come.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.035
The idea is that when it comes,
it'll be on our terms.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.953
- On our terms?
- Yeah, there's no way in hell.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.713
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men
and slaughter us all.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.792
If you want to leave, leave.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.435
Just don't take anything
you didn't bring with you.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.400
You want to keep your town,
you're gonna have to fight for it.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.279
Now, we're here to help you,
but you got to help us.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.238
We're gonna need every somebody out here
to help us fight.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.756
Good Lord! Are you suggesting we wait here
to face retaliation?

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.955
- Hell, yeah, he is.
- What?

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.237
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.
- I beg pardon, sir.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.072
The spirit here is willing,

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.196
- but we are not killers.
- That's right.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.590
Most aren't, till they're looking
down the barrel of a gun.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.151
Now, I never shot anything
that could shoot back at me.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.874
But this is our home.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.256
- Damned if I won't defend it.
- That's right.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.256
And now let me tell you,
these men that are coming here,

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.633
they're gonna underestimate you.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.960
That'll be their first mistake.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.595
That's all well and good,
but we don't have enough time.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.760
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,
that was eight days ago.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.195
- One week.
- That only leaves us... No, one week?

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.952
- One week?
- One week.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.156
Three days' ride to Sacramento
with the bad news,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.470
one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.039
Seven days, that's all you got.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.839
For goodness' sake.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.713
We'll get started in the morning.
Get a good night's rest.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.031
May be your last for a while.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.392
I'll have some more beans.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.590
Like being in one of them damn zoos.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.717
Fame is a sarcophagus.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.640
You read those in a book,
or you just make 'em up as you go?

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.349
I'll try to use
one-syllable words from now on.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.631
What... What's a syllable?

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.198
White people's food...

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.713
...is for dogs.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.949
What'd he say?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.557
He asked that you kindly stop
staring at his hairline.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.874
I will.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.520
As long as he stops
licking his lips over mine, hmm?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.720
Ah...

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.875
These bodies don't get buried
in the church graveyard.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.473
You take 'em to Boot Hill.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.120
I expect
we'll make ten miles by sundown.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.590
I suppose that undertaker's
gonna get some business out of this deal.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:08.229
I guarantee you, there ain't
no reason to be running off scared.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.914
Hate to see y'all go like this, now.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.155
Now, now, won't you reconsider?

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.200
Hyah!

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.795
Who'd have thought
we'd travel this many miles

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:32.749
just to have the good people of Rose Creek
turn tail and leave us to die?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.675
Well, some people have died for much less.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.039
Behold.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.193
Our army approaches.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.870
Oh, good, they brought their pitchforks.
We may stand a chance after all.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.876
Lord, keep me from judgment.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.874
Gun on your shoulder.
Right shoulder.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.073
Knives. There's nothing to it.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.676
Oh, boy.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.233
Who here fought
in the War of Northern Aggression?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.955
Mmm. Not me.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.473
What is this? Come on.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.993
Throw.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.593
Slash.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.117
Stab. That's it.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
Yah!

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.720
Yah!

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:49.712
That simple.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.631
- Like hell.
- Hey.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.553
- How the hell we gonna learn to do that?
- Get back here!

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.834
Get back!

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.353
Fire!

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.750
Jesus wept!

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.988
Reload!

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.274
Statistically speaking,
they should've hit something.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.112
Y'all starting to piss me off.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.397
How many times I got to tell you
to keep your foot up underneath you, huh?

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:22.278
Come on, now.
Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:23.479
Jesus!

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.955
Teddy...

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.948
Expect more from you, son.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.200
The recoil is not to be shunned,
it's to be absorbed.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:32.510
I ain't shunning a damn thing, sir.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.872
You trying to make me angry?
Is that what it is?

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.393
- Do you...
- Oh!

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.917
That's the second time for you.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.720
- Go make me some eggs.
- The damn hammer...

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.234
No, I don't wanna hear it!
Have a nice afternoon.

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.015
You gonna point...
You gonna point that rifle at me?

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.154
No, sir.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.678
You cut the ears off a mule,
don't make him a horse.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760
Leave your weapon.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.536
I'm trying to help you.
You understand?

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.074
Keep the target soft,
pull the trigger slow.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.118
- So slow. You can't pull it slow enough.
- Like that?

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.156
Let the shot surprise you.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.113
All right, now.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.678
Fire when ready.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.028
Fire!

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.357
Think I pinched my finger.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.154
Bless their hearts.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.559
That's hard to do.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.518
This many men and miss that many targets?

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600
Twice?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.880
I'm looking at a line of dead men.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.317
You gotta hate what you're firing at!

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.992
Hate it! Come on!

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.753
Get some gravel in your craw!

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.637
Goddamn sons of bitches!

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.755
All right.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.357
These men need inspiration.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.115
- Inspire them.
- Yeah.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.192
You are Goodnight Robicheaux, after all.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.678
Aint'cha?

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.671
I can hit sand, but we need the lead.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.318
Twenty-three confirmed kills at Antietam.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.829
This is one of Connolly's
Confederate sharpshooters.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.753
Dubbed "the Angel of Death."

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.388
Do what he does.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.558
He's a legend.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.832
Or is that all you are?

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.350
Whoa!

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.496
- That's some fancy shooting there.
- He did it. He did it.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.801
- That's why they call him Goodnight.
- You're telling me.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.598
- Can you believe that?
- That's fantastic.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.555
Told you.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.318
Y'all go home, polish your rifles,
maybe the glint'll scare 'em off.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.312
We ain't gonna shoot no more?

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.752
So this is our trap.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.314
It might work. Pin 'em in there.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.400
Well, it might, if we can teach
more than half of these townsfolk

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.239
to hit the broad side
of a barn at ten paces.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.151
Come up with a few surprises.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.037
We'll need more than a few.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.917
It's a box of death.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.788
So melt the elements, with fervent heat.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.871
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.233
What do you think?

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.033
Reminds me of this fella I used to know.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.997
Fell off a five-story building.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.480
Passed each floor on the way down.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.677
People inside heard him say,
"So far, so good!"

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.189
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.831
I make good on my horse yet, Sam?

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.672
So far, so good. Let's go get some ammo.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Come on.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.951
Mr. Bogue wants this mine stripped
before he gets back.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.079
Move it, you lazy dogs!

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.028
Move that gold out!

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.878
Fire in the hole!

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.478
That sounded like a gunshot!

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.399
It's coming from the cliff.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.919
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.150
- Keep the powder down.
- Look-it, right there.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.272
These ain't Bogue's guys.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.557
Yup. They done killed them all.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.674
This mine is now closed.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.152
You men are free to go.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.918
Or you can stay and fight.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.516
- This will help.
- Yeah.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.557
I've always wanted to blow something up.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.239
Go back inside.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.280
Whoa-hoa-hoa!

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.357
Mr. Chisolm, what's this?

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.075
Reinforcements.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.196
- What's that on the wagon?
- Dynamite.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.840
Dynamite? Where you gonna put that stuff?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.276
- Your place.
- My place? Why my place?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.193
Oh, Lord. Please be careful with it.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.232
My town. My gold. How?

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.312
It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue,
I couldn't...

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.876
There just wasn't enough.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.753
And that I'd be a coward?

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.319
Uh...

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.352
If you didn't come to Rose Creek. Yes, sir.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.670
- He said his name was Chisolm?
- Sam Chisolm.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.990
- From Lincoln?
- Like the president.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.513
He name his price?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.670
He didn't have one. Just terms.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.039
All men have a price.
Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.514
Not this man.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.357
How many men you say?

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.236
- Seven.
- Seven? Seven?

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.670
Seven men ride into my town,

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.716
dispatch with 22 of the best guns
money can buy?

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.896
Is that what you're telling me?

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.720
They fought like three
times that, Mr. Bogue.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.588
Bullshit.
It was nothing but the element of surprise.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.039
Hey.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.479
Surprise.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.437
You think Rockefeller
had to do things himself?

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.555
Vanderbilt?

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.200
Everything I have, I worked for it.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:47.035
Not like them, with their fancy friends
and their pocketed politicians.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.475
I want land, you know what I do.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.669
I take it.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.591
You know what history will say
about Rose Creek?

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.194
Nothing.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.669
It won't have existed for long enough.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.637
But history will remember me,

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.669
and what I built.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.436
Mr. Denali,
recruit an army to go back with us.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320
Pretty.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.274
I mean good.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.519
Your shooting is good. Do it again.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.831
Sight the lowest part of the V,
cheek resting against the...

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.392
I had a father, thank you.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.560
I didn't.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.355
Whoo! God dang it, I'm good.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.833
Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.075
I mean, why are you here

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.990
fighting someone else's fight?

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.200
I needed my horse back,
and this was the price.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.672
Six pounds of pressure.
That's all that's required to kill a man.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.796
And they say the nightmares never go away.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.036
Those nightmares,
they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.513
You might want to wear some pants
if you're fixing to fight.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.176
Bogue will come from the south.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.350
Now, he'll prefer high ground,

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.794
but we'll try to lure him into town,
turn it into a shooting gallery.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.078
Now, if we can create enough confusion,
maybe we can get them to break ranks.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.754
That's a lotta
open space here, Sam.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.400
I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.795
We're not.
We're gonna let 'em in.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.037
Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here,
leave this open here,

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.111
make this into a graveyard.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.310
Goodnight, you're our
best shot with a rifle.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.709
You find high ground
that gives you a clear line of sight,

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.519
you keep Bogue in your sights
once the chaos starts.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.056
Now, we have some shotguns.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.629
We can get the men who can't shoot,
place 'em in front of each door.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.438
It's hard to miss a doorway.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.478
We could dig trenches.
Shoot all the way out that way.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.757
Trouble with taking one of these positions,
you can't ever get down.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.798
Now, whatever happens, Bogue can't leave.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.096
How do we even know
Bogue's gonna show?

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.873
- He'll show.
- And if he just shoots you in the head?

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.077
Then just shoot him in the head.
Hell, I don't know, uh, avenge me.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.991
If we can lure him into the bottleneck,
close the door behind him,

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.310
each group fire and advance,
we stand a chance.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.839
Worst-case scenario,
all is lost and we blow the mine.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.200
This right
here is the best spot.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.630
Can we take position up there? Is it safe?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.312
Anything left up there to stand on?

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.038
Won't have to go too far
to pray for forgiveness.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.313
There you go.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.190
But there is no forgiveness
for men like you, güero.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.999
Don't call me güero.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.638
What's güero mean, anyway?

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.315
- Handsome? Debonair?
- Yeah, something like that.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.992
No, this is our stronghold.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.832
You funnel them all towards the church.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.035
Where am I?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.395
You keep the women and children
safe and out of harm...

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.754
I aim to fight.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.874
Well, if it comes to that,
then we're all dead, ain't we?

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.677
Let's hope if we die, we've confessed.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.355
Goody.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.200
You all right?

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.634
What do you say, Sam,
about 50 or 75 yards out?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.555
That's our trench.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.439
Ditches on each side!
The rest of y'all stand to the side!

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.830
We're gonna need another ditch
by the livery. See that?

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.628
Good, and heave!

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.234
- All right, tie it up, now.
- Put your weapon...

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.037
Make sure you paint the whole thing.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.111
Very smart, smoking, huh?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.036
- Whoa!
- Three minutes.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.593
That's too much land to cover.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.113
Where them eggs come from?

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.790
A chicken's ass, you dummy.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.471
Did I introduce you to my wife?

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.356
Her name is Ethel, and I love her.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.670
Hello, Ethel. Charmed.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.157
And I consider her to
be the love of my life.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.909
And she is a no-bullshitter,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.200
- she's a straight shooter.
- All right, calm down, now.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.993
Put the gun away, son.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.310
- Her name is Ethel.
- Put it away.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.356
And you'll show her some goddamn respect.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.759
Yeah.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.112
It's Maria you can disrespect.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.911
Don't tell Ethel about Maria.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.118
Wait, wait, wait. My Maria, cabrón? Hmm?

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.148
You have a Maria?

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.760
I have three Marias!

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.513
That's not right.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.716
The owl followed me here.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.952
- Nothing's following you.
- I heard the voice.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.216
- Goody...
- I heard the voice.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.879
- Goody.
- Billy, I heard it.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.238
I pull that trigger in violence again,
I'm gonna die a ghastly death, Billy.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.878
I heard it.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.896
- Same thing, it's not the same thing.
- Yeah, it is.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.356
No, a woman's a woman,
a gun's a gun, in the Lord's eye.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.112
They're just dreams, Goody.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.031
You talk about guns, you talk about women,

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.960
you talk about 'em separately.
It ain't right.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.434
Sure it is. Sure it is, my friend.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.472
I had a wife once.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.997
Had a family. Had some children, too.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.877
- One time.
- Mmm?

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.349
Now the stitching'll outlast you,
I imagine.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.715
That's... That's very nice of you.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.791
I didn't ask you to do that.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.675
I didn't ask you to ask.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640
Mmm. Mmm.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.918
You quit staring.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.353
I didn't ask her to do that.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.512
Well, the lady just did some poking
and sticking for you.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.108
Maybe you should consider
returning the favor, you know?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.996
Okay, all right.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.037
- Evening, Mr. Chisolm.
- Preacher.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.231
- Ah, what a beautiful night it is.
- Yes, it is.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.353
I just wanted to take a moment
to come up here

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.069
and to thank you
for everything that you've done for us.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.711
It's been a long while since we've been able
to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.758
Before you and your men arrived,

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.594
all of our everyday pleasures
had been taken from us.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.431
To have those back,
even if only for a moment,

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.040
well, it might not mean that much to you,

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.078
but, by God,
we are all eternally grateful to you.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.157
More than you know, preacher.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.911
Last thing I wanna be doing
is playing cards.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.638
- All night.
- All night.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.756
You know, some of these folks
ain't gonna make it.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.795
Yeah.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.598
- Here we go. Easy. Easy.
- Steady.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.955
- Throw me the other end!
- Here you go.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.837
- Whoa, whoa!
- Okay, pues.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.956
- That far enough?
- That'll do!

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.796
All right, two or three more
of those, then we're good.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.757
That's it, right there.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.390
Look. Look. Look.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.678
Watch your head now, Teddy.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.318
Now you can pray for us, Father.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.995
My brother, I will pray for you
until I forget how to pray.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.672
Water, Mr. Chisolm?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.600
This is a grand day
in the history books of Rose Creek!

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.111
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm, sir.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.111
Vindication, brothers and sisters!

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.715
- Water, Mr. Horne?
- Thank you, miss.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.792
For God's glory!

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.515
Bogue comes with his men.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800
When?

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.632
Dawn.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.512
The Lord said, "Where there
are two or three gathered in My name,

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.874
"I will be there."

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.679
You just gonna run off
before you get your cut of the gold?

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.077
Well, y'all gonna be dead
this time tomorrow, Sam.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.716
I believe every man's got the right
to choose where he dies, if he can.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.476
Well, that kind of talk
may work with these other sons of bitches,

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.198
but I know why you're here.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.115
And it's not for the benefit of mankind.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.270
You run out on these people, Goody,

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.114
and you gonna be disappointing
more than just them or me.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.715
Remember what you said to me
when them Billy Yanks

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.756
were kicking my sorry ass
six ways to Sunday?

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.319
- Mmm-hmm. I remember.
- Yeah?

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.437
You asked me why I wanted to save
a piece of rebel trash like you,

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.800
and I told you the war was over.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.136
- But it ain't over, Sam.
- Yes, it is.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.515
No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:03.070
It keeps going on and on and on.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.438
- I seen so much death.
- The war is over

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.317
for both of us.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.429
What we lost in the fire,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.032
we'll find in the ashes.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.114
I need you.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.758
I've become everything I despise. I...

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.718
- I'm faint-hearted...
- Mmm.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.074
And I'm a coward.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.388
Bye.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.677
You remember me as I was.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.720
Come on.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.913
...hallowed be Thy name.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.479
Thy kingdom come,

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.837
Thy will be done,

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.229
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.788
Give us this day our daily bread

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.950
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.393
You all right?

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.474
Well...

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.080
Where's Billy?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.233
It looks like he's started to drink.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.190
All right. Well...

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.230
Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.436
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.951
What about you?

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.632
I...

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.233
I believe I'm gonna see this through.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.197
These people deserve their lives back.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:56.508
I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.480
You know, I knew that tomorrow
was gonna be a dark day.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.996
And now that there's one less of us,
gonna be darker.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.314
But to be in the service of others

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.516
with men that I respect,

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.113
like you all...

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.755
Well, I shouldn't have
to ask for more than that.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.272
- I'll see you in the morning.
- All right.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.114
I'm hungry.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.070
Wait. Hell, you speak English?

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280
So?

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.757
You little shit.
We got a lot to talk about.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.038
Don't walk away from me!

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.952
I'll take his place.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.116
- Who?
- Goodnight.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.117
Just saw him ride out.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.595
Thank you for the strength
that you have given me.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.195
It's time.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.696
Come on, children!

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.096
- Come on.
- Children, quickly, please, go on.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.475
- Let's go.
- Come on, hurry!

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.439
Hurry, children!

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.400
Come on, come on.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.318
Now get on down in there. Come on.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.913
Watch your step.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.716
Easy, easy.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.880
Steady.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:18.880
Hyah, hyah.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.239
Easy now, easy.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.839
Chisolm?

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.034
It's him, all right.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.440
It's only minutes.

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.576
Shh!

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.592
We're safe. Nothing to fear.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.680
Yeah.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.078
Mr. Denali.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.190
Keep it clear!

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.229
- Come on!
- Steady!

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.960
That's it, straight on!

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.834
- Mask up.
- All together. Come on.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.949
Bring 'em up!

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.789
Steady on, boys! Steady on!

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.159
Mind your sister.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.228
Come on, line up, boys.
Steady on, steady on!

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.080
Hyah! Hyah!

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.096
Shoot whoever you see!

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.429
Don't spare a soul, do you hear me?

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.016
Go around! Go around!

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.473
Go through the miners' camp!

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.868
Just stay with me, boys!

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.557
Drain all the blood
from their bodies, you hear me?

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.719
I'm counting.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.835
Five.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640
Four.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.196
Three.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.194
Two.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.312
Let's go, come on!

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.595
One!

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.915
One!

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.468
Hold! Hold!

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.835
Shh, shh, shh.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.955
Keep your line!

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.520
Head to the left!

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.876
Pull!

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.136
Watch your back coming in!

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160
Get him!

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.800
I can't see 'em from here!

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.157
Hey! Easy, easy, easy!

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.960
Let's do it!

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.109
- Now!
- Come on!

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.111
- Let's go!
- Shoot, shoot!

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.635
Dig in! Keep shooting!

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.869
I got him!

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.756
Here they come! Stand your ground!

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.074
- Through here, go!
- Cut him off round that bend!

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.760
Get him! Go!

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.635
Watch your right!

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.228
- Shoot! Go around, fire!
- Head him off, over there!

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.829
There's another one up top!

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.120
Over there!

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:28.758
"Although I walk through the valley

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.115
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.078
"for Thou art with me."

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.600
That's it! Unload on him!

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.995
I got him!

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.269
- Here!
- There!

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.953
Go 'round, go 'round!

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.553
- Ain't no way through!
- Come on!

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.269
Push the wagon!

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.714
Get to the church!

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.960
Let's go, come on!

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.598
Now! Now!

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.232
Hyah! Hyah!

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.416
There's too many of 'em.
They're gonna kill all of us!

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.670
No! No! Stay down!

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.909
Keep shooting!

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080
Whoa!

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.160
Whoa!

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.199
What are you doing there?

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.713
Get back to the livery stable!

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.474
Just keep moving!

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.559
They're gonna kill us all!

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.793
We're outnumbered!

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.955
Go around the barn!

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.632
We're clear, we're clear!

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.515
Keep shooting!

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.994
Light up that wagon!

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.636
- They're on that roof!
- Push them wagons!

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.075
Block 'em in!

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.555
They got us trapped!

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.154
Ain't no way out!

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.629
Go, go, go!

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800
Open 'em up!

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.319
Go get the wagon.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.029
Head to the church!

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.074
Into the church!

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.233
Bring the fight to these cowards!

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.878
Yeah, let's kill these bastards!

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.431
- Wagons! Wagons! Let's go.
- Hurry, güero!

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.560
Light 'em up and lock
these sons of bitches in here!

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.198
Lock 'em up! Let's...

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.315
Güero, man!

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.069
- Light it up!
- Yeah.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.680
That's far enough. Leave it, let's go!

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.913
Are you okay, güero?

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.472
So far, so good.

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.880
Can't get out! It's a dead end!

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.636
- We're trapped!
- Go the other way!

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.913
- We still have men there, sir.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.675
I'm going!

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.029
- Go.
- Keep shooting!

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.189
They're trapped!

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.439
Keep shooting!

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.879
Keep shooting, güerito!

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.150
Go 'round! It's blocked!

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.720
Now!

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.595
Come on!

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.953
They got the devil's breath!

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.036
They got a goddamn Gatling gun!

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.795
Let 'em have it.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.715
Let's run!

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.069
Get the fuck...

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.794
Gavin, damn it!

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.712
Take cover!

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.791
- Go on, Miss Emma.
- Get down!

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.960
They have a Gatling gun!
A Gatling gun!

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.395
Get inside! Inside, inside!

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.589
- Billy!
- Hey, Goody!

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.029
- Go! Gun!
- Gatling gun!

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.758
Move, get out of the way, go on!

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.879
Get down, get down!

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.189
Go on, Miss Emma, go!

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.392
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.675
They're reloading! Stay down! Stay down!

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.432
Get down!

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.555
The children.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.755
- Get down.
- Get down!

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.114
- Get down against the wall, come on!
- Hey, Goody!

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.635
- Yeah, I see 'em, I see 'em.
- Let's go, Billy!

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:12.520
We gotta get these kids outta here.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.159
All right, everybody, come on.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.576
- Everyone, up the stairs.
- Quick, quick.

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.000
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Be careful.

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.716
Can't walk. They got my leg, sir.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.274
Schoolteacher, what are you doing up here?

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.634
I want to stay.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.073
Come on, now, get outta here!

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.760
Wrap that leg! Stop the bleeding.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.676
Find some ammo. You did good...

01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.909
Shit!

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.840
Ah!

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.552
We are giants put on this earth

01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.076
to rid it of evil and to
keep all that is good!

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.278
- Straight to the field. Come on.
- Quickly. Quickly!

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.736
- Go on, children, hurry.
- Come on.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:09.829
- Quickly.
- To the field.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.313
- Keep going, keep going!
- Anthony!

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:51.628
- Quickly now.
- Anthony!

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.278
- Pa! Quickly!
- Go, go, go.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.713
- You can't...
- Go, go, go!

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.720
- Come on. Stay together.
- Let's go! Go, go, go.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.552
Keep going! To the ridge line!

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.159
Come on. Just keep going.

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.838
Get down. Get down!

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.353
Come on. Come on.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.152
Get down!

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.835
They're coming!

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.911
We're running outta ammo, boys!

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.357
- Shit, Billy.
- I knew you'd come back.

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:30.918
You did, did you?
How'd you know that?

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.594
- You forgot this.
- Whoo!

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.348
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yeah!

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.997
You're a disgrace.

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.560
Over there! Over there!

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:15.600
Ammo, ammo!

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.993
This is all we've got.

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.279
This reminds me of
what my daddy used to say.

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:24.675
What's that, Goody?

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.520
What?

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.353
Well, my daddy used to say
a lot of things, you know.

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.190
- You all right?
- Hell yeah.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.998
So far, so good.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.718
I might need a new vest.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.716
Damn, we gotta do something
about that gun.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.435
Hey.

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.909
You know what?

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.153
We're even.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.992
For the horse. You don't owe me anything.

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.354
Well, you owe me.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.760
What's that?

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.549
Cover.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.119
Come on! Come on!

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.200
Over here!

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.914
- This side, Goody.
- Hyah!

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.719
- Ride, Faraday, ride!
- Hyah!

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:47.880
What do we have here?

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.999
Get the two in the back.

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:08.960
Hit the steeple.

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:19.315
I got him!

01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:36.995
Oh, Goody.

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:47.680
Hah!

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.480
Come on, boy!

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:03.160
Why don't you stay down, boy?

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.753
Let's go, boys.

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.600
Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.120
Dynamite.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:01.356
I've always been lucky with one-eyed jacks.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.869
Dynamite!

01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.509
Bring them

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.151
Bring them in

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.154
Chisolm?

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.633
Should I know that name?

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.630
You should know it from your obituary.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.035
Ah.

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.233
We connected, somehow?

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.436
14th of October, 1867.

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:31.397
Did you hire renegade Greys to pillage
and steal land in Kansas?

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.238
Homesteaders.

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.519
Good people trying
to make a life for themselves,

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:40.715
like these people here.

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.596
If God didn't want 'em sheared,

01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.750
he wouldn't have made 'em sheep.

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.109
Ahhh!

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.035
No.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.120
Pick it up.

02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.391
Go on, pick it up. Pick it up.

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.595
Pick it up!

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.637
You a God-fearing man? Huh?

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:03.755
Yeah.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.630
Please, just leave.

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:33.871
Please leave me be! Please!

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.193
Please.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.192
I... I beg your pardon.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.552
I've done you wrong.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:48.959
God.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:54.879
I want you to pray with me.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.955
All right?

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.115
Come on.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:05.120
All right?

02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.551
- Ask for forgiveness.
- Wait.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.633
- Yeah, you can.
- I...

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.757
You close your eyes, and you pray.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.673
Pray for my mother

02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.159
that your men raped.

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.796
Go on, pray. You pray.

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.560
Pray for my two sisters...

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.478
...that your men murdered.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.995
That they strung up.

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.736
Did they pray
when they put the rope around my neck?

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:39.113
Did they pray then?

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.120
Pray, pray.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.273
I remember. Chisolm...

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.873
- I remember.
- You remember?

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.234
I said pray.

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:56.233
No.

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.879
Hallelujah.

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.196
Killing me won't give you
the satisfaction you want!

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.198
"Our Father..."

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.280
Say it.

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.957
"Who art in heaven.

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.393
"Hallowed be Thy name." Say it.

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.395
"Thy kingdom come..." Go on.

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.360
Come on.

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:25.114
Say it.

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.879
Amen.

02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.274
Faraday?

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:45.079
Thank you, Father.

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.429
Preacher.

02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:57.191
I'm gonna take good care
of your men, Mr. Chisolm.

02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.548
Proper.

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.359
You made it? You made it through!

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.474
Let's go.

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.896
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm.

02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:20.280
Take care of Jack, Teddy.

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.550
- Miss Emma.
- Thank you.

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.474
- Thank you so much, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:46.630
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:48.472
Godspeed, men.

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:54.519
Mom, is it over?

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:57.360
Mommy?

02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:00.079
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:10.033
That's all right.
As long as I can walk, I'll be fine.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.470
Whatever they were in life,

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:55.273
here, at the end,

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:59.911
each man stood with courage and honor.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.152
They fought for the ones
who couldn't fight for themselves,

02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:07.158
and they died for them, too.

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:10.636
