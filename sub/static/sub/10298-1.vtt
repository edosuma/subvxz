picture-perfect day like this.</i>

01:34.601 --> 01:36.067
Mom, please.

01:36.067 --> 01:38.400
Is this how I'm gonna spend
my Labor Day weekend?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.334
Sitting between
my mother

01:40.334 --> 01:41.968
and a pizza
with everything?

01:44.968 --> 01:46.801
The holiday
got you down, Kel?

01:46.801 --> 01:48.400
Let's just pretend
it's a normal day.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.100
Get up on the table,
dance around,

01:50.100 --> 01:51.434
and me and Mom
will put dollars

01:51.434 --> 01:53.234
down your blouse.

01:54.501 --> 01:55.601
Now, Bud,

01:55.601 --> 01:57.300
not everything
Reverend Felcher says

01:57.300 --> 01:58.934
from the pulpit
is true.

01:58.934 --> 02:00.234
Ha, ha, ha.

02:03.367 --> 02:06.167
Greeting, vultures.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.100
You meal ticket's here.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.667
Guess where
I have been.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.767
Locked in the trunk
of your car

02:27.767 --> 02:29.934
with a dead cat?

02:29.934 --> 02:30.934
And no one understands

02:30.934 --> 02:33.133
why I scream
on the way home.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.534
Anyhow,
I was thinking,

02:34.534 --> 02:36.968
how could we have
a perfect Labor Day?

02:36.968 --> 02:37.968
And then it hit me.

02:37.968 --> 02:39.801
While all those
families of morons

02:39.801 --> 02:42.167
are wasting their time
going to the beach,

02:42.167 --> 02:44.367
guess where we're gonna be.

02:44.367 --> 02:46.067
No, not another
family barbecue.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.400
Yes, a family
barbecue!

02:48.400 --> 02:51.801
Who's going to give it
a "Whoa, Bundy," here?

02:51.801 --> 02:54.234
Huh?

02:54.234 --> 02:55.934
No one? Fine.

02:55.934 --> 02:58.801
Oh, Al. Honey,
don't get us wrong.

02:58.801 --> 03:00.167
It's not that
we don't enjoy

03:00.167 --> 03:02.167
sweltering
in the back yard,

03:02.167 --> 03:04.067
being bitten
by horseflies

03:04.067 --> 03:06.067
and watching you scratch
your sweaty back

03:06.067 --> 03:07.734
with our salad forks.

03:07.734 --> 03:11.033
But, honey,
just once

03:11.033 --> 03:13.200
we would like to do
something we want.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.267
We can't do something
that you want,

03:15.267 --> 03:16.934
and I'll tell you why.

03:16.934 --> 03:20.133
Because it's Labor Day,
not Leech Day.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.634
That's Christmas.

03:22.634 --> 03:24.067
It's not Parasite Day.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.901
That's Mother's Day.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.934
See, this is a holiday
for the working guy.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.767
It celebrates
all the people who work,

03:30.767 --> 03:33.701
so that all the people
who don't

03:33.701 --> 03:36.534
can live longer and
have more than he does.

03:36.534 --> 03:37.901
So tomorrow...

03:37.901 --> 03:41.133
unless, God willing,
I die in my sleep...

03:41.133 --> 03:44.868
I get up for me
and celebrate for me.

03:44.868 --> 03:50.367
Tomorrow is Al Bun-Day.

03:50.367 --> 03:53.601
Gee, I thought
that was Al-oween.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.167
I don't want to sit
around the house

03:57.167 --> 03:58.734
all day and sleep.

03:58.734 --> 04:01.934
It's like being
at school.

04:01.934 --> 04:04.000
No, the difference between
here and school

04:04.000 --> 04:06.334
is you'll be out of here
when you're 18.

04:14.334 --> 04:17.634
Now, tomorrow your job
is to go shopping.

04:17.634 --> 04:20.666
Why can't we shop today?
Traffic too light?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.334
Because, if you were
paying attention

04:22.334 --> 04:23.601
all these years,

04:23.601 --> 04:25.400
you'd know that
Al Bundy doesn't barbecue

04:25.400 --> 04:26.701

04:28.667 --> 04:30.167
to get me fresh meat,
fresh cheese,

04:30.167 --> 04:31.400
and fresh charcoal.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
And watch those chips.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.868
I don't want you
getting anything

04:33.868 --> 04:36.234

"natural ingredients."

04:36.234 --> 04:37.701
Now, kids,

04:37.701 --> 04:40.300
since we're all gonna spend
the whole day together tomorrow,

04:40.300 --> 04:41.467

04:42.501 --> 04:44.234
Oh, and don't forget.

04:44.234 --> 04:47.567
I don't want my ketchup
in those plastic squeeze things.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.801
I want bottles,
just like the Pilgrims had.

04:49.801 --> 04:53.133
I wish you could
have seen your father

04:53.133 --> 04:54.801
when he was
in high school,

04:54.801 --> 04:56.100
before all this happened.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.434
As I recall,
they almost did.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.634
I can't wait
to have kids

05:04.634 --> 05:06.434
so I can
make them suffer.

05:06.434 --> 05:07.901
And when they ask
who their dad is,

05:07.901 --> 05:09.334
you can play
"Wheel of Father."

05:16.801 --> 05:18.434

in all this.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.367
Your job
is very important too.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.467
You get to bring the benches
from the basement

05:22.467 --> 05:25.133

the bird doody.

the excitement, Peg?

05:35.133 --> 05:37.901
Oh, Al, I've given up
on excitement.

05:37.901 --> 05:40.167
I'm going for relief.

05:40.167 --> 05:42.200

to a little promise

just last spring.

wouldn't come for free.

for her sainted ashes
