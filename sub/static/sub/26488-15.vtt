Come on.

00:01.398 --> 00:03.164
Cook your signature dish.

00:03.453 --> 00:05.364
It's perfect for family dinner.
What is your problem?

00:05.388 --> 00:07.533
Sure. There's nothing better
than pitting family

00:07.557 --> 00:09.034
against one another in a contest

00:09.058 --> 00:11.270
to guarantee a stressless
and loving meal.

00:11.294 --> 00:12.905
Hey... whatever it takes
to get us all together,

00:12.929 --> 00:14.140
I'm down with that.
Thank you.

00:14.164 --> 00:15.441
Uh, and I think you will find

00:15.465 --> 00:17.143
my mandarin orange chicken miraculous.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.244
Mmm, thanks.
Do you want one?

00:18.268 --> 00:19.245
Dad!
Yes. She wants one.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.713
What?
We said no campaigning.

00:20.737 --> 00:23.249
Exactly. <font color="#80ffff">(COUGHING)</font>
Waffle potato pancakes.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.817
Hey...
Oh, thank you, that was very subtle.

00:24.841 --> 00:27.086
Waffle potato pancakes,
always Yukon Gold,

00:27.110 --> 00:29.955
always hand shredded.
And thank you.

00:29.979 --> 00:33.092
Thank you to my brilliant
and lovely sister

00:33.116 --> 00:37.496
for not cooking, so that we might
truly enjoy this meal. <font color="#80ffff">(CLAPPING)</font>

00:37.520 --> 00:38.509
<font color="#80ff80">HENRY:</font> Yes. Thank you.

00:38.533 --> 00:41.066
Well... it is my signature dish.
Thank you, thank you.

00:41.090 --> 00:43.035
Now dig in.
Okay.

00:43.059 --> 00:44.937
Um... c-can we say grace?

00:44.961 --> 00:46.672
Oh, we don't do that, sweetie.

00:46.696 --> 00:48.107
Well, why not?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.675
Yeah, we'll talk about it
at home, okay?

00:49.699 --> 00:51.444
It's fine with us.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.878
But not with the man
who never takes off

00:52.902 --> 00:54.380
his John 3:30 bracelet.

00:54.404 --> 00:57.316
Well, that's about faith.
And this is personal.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.151
I-I'm happy to talk about this later.

00:59.175 --> 01:00.519
I just don't think we should casually

01:00.543 --> 01:01.520
participate in a ritual

01:01.544 --> 01:03.088
we haven't defined for ourselves.

01:03.112 --> 01:04.690
Well, Annie casually
participated in saying grace

01:04.714 --> 01:06.692
at Gwendolyn's house,
and she liked it.

01:06.716 --> 01:09.462
This really isn't the time
or the place to discuss it.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.696
Exactly. So in the meantime,
if she wants to say

01:10.720 --> 01:12.131
a prayer and be thankful,
it wouldn't hurt anyone.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.132
And I think that this should

01:13.156 --> 01:15.234
be a family meeting for another time.

01:15.258 --> 01:18.337
What if the McCords say grace
and, Annie, you can join in?

01:18.361 --> 01:21.263
What if you two don't put
me on the spot like this?

01:23.900 --> 01:26.045
Mandarin chicken, anybody?

01:26.069 --> 01:27.580
I'm not campaigning, just asking.

01:27.604 --> 01:28.981
Do you remember the prayer
you said at Gwendolyn's house?

01:29.005 --> 01:31.050
Soph.
<font color="#80ff80">ANNIE:</font> Yeah.

01:31.074 --> 01:34.920
"God is great, God is good.
Let us thank him for this food."

01:34.944 --> 01:35.921
There we go. Amen.
Amen.

01:35.945 --> 01:38.090
Annie, do you want chicken?
Yes.

01:38.114 --> 01:39.032
Yum.

01:39.056 --> 01:41.427
<font color="#80ff80">HENRY:</font> Okay, what,
these-these are vegan, right?

01:50.226 --> 01:51.504
I can't get past it.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.128
You should really try.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.343
Was it really such a big deal

01:57.367 --> 01:59.278
that his eight-year-old daughter
wanted to say

01:59.302 --> 02:00.779
a prayer before dinner?

02:00.803 --> 02:02.281
What, he can't participate

02:02.305 --> 02:04.850
in anything until he's defined it?

02:04.874 --> 02:06.485
What-what is that?
Babe, a lot of couples have struggles

02:06.509 --> 02:08.561
around the role religion is
gonna play in their lives.

02:08.585 --> 02:10.923
Yes, of course.
Remember us after Stevie was born?

02:10.947 --> 02:15.194
Yes, but the difference is,
you... are a sane person

02:15.218 --> 02:18.030
who is willing to listen
and respect the fact

02:18.054 --> 02:19.665
that your wife was
still working through

02:19.689 --> 02:23.369
some issues about organized religion.
Yes, and you were able

02:23.393 --> 02:24.837
to understand that it was
important to me to have the kids

02:24.861 --> 02:26.038
get some exposure to it.
Fine.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.842
Maybe Will and Sophie...
just haven't had that talk.

02:29.866 --> 02:32.011
Still... he couldn't
just do it for Annie?

02:32.035 --> 02:35.414
Have the-the big talk later?

02:35.438 --> 02:36.849
I don't know.

02:36.873 --> 02:40.152
You can't just put your kid
in the middle of a scene

02:40.176 --> 02:44.813
like that to defend some
vague... you know...

02:47.483 --> 02:48.984
...principle.

02:51.821 --> 02:54.400
So you're just deliberately
not getting involved.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.703
Bingo.

02:57.727 --> 03:00.806
Because you think that I'm-I'm
too parental with Will?

03:00.830 --> 03:02.708
Correct.

03:02.732 --> 03:05.744
Well, I was, actually...

03:05.768 --> 03:10.749
sort of like his parent.
And I feel a responsibility

03:10.773 --> 03:13.052
to help when he...

03:13.076 --> 03:14.075
does these things that are...

03:14.099 --> 03:15.487
Yeah, but then you just
talk in that tone of voice,

03:15.511 --> 03:17.056
and he gets angry and defensive,

03:17.080 --> 03:20.215
and he can't take in a word you say.
...so extraordinarily stupid.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.102
Maybe you should talk to him.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.939
Uh, no.
He respects you.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.610
You could give him
some... religious advice.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.845
Babe, he's a grown man.
It would be a perfect time for you

03:39.869 --> 03:41.780
to trot out your old pal Aquinas.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.016
I'm not gonna talk to him
about his adult behavior.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.017
It wasn't all that adult.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.820
Stop it.

03:47.844 --> 03:51.690
Look... you're going away tomorrow.

03:51.714 --> 03:54.393
Why don't you join me in this bed

03:54.417 --> 03:57.452
and we can not talk about it?

03:59.122 --> 04:00.633
Okay.

on the seventh floor

04:09.799 --> 04:14.046
into a horrifying fever dream.

I don't have to go to
Afghanistan with this crowd.

04:23.446 --> 04:25.557
The signing of the Afghanistan
Rebuild-Renew Agreement

04:25.581 --> 04:27.333
would be the event of the
year if we can pull it off.

04:27.357 --> 04:30.562
Hey! Leave it! Thank you.

04:30.586 --> 04:32.231
You're right. It could get tense.

of details to work out

04:33.890 --> 04:36.035
with President Sharza
about the spending

04:36.059 --> 04:38.937
of this $10 billion aid
package we're sending them.

04:38.961 --> 04:40.973
Yeah, well, they've done
everything they promised

04:40.997 --> 04:42.841
in terms of meeting
their human rights benchmarks

04:42.865 --> 04:44.510
and allowing the Taliban
to be a part of the government.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.045
So, they'll be tough,
but it'll work out,

04:46.069 --> 04:47.780
because it's $10 billion
and they need it.

04:47.804 --> 04:49.548
And Gordon Becker
will get that drawdown

04:49.572 --> 04:51.784
on close to 90,000 troops.

04:51.808 --> 04:54.253
Still no women allowed
in government, though.

04:54.277 --> 04:57.823
That must have been a hard
concession for M-Sec to make.

04:57.847 --> 04:59.391
You have no idea. Majority of Afghans

04:59.415 --> 05:00.826
wanted the Taliban
involved in the government,

05:00.850 --> 05:02.661
and they weren't willing
to budge on that.

05:02.685 --> 05:05.064

another hundred years or so.

Of course he is. His one
and only mother is turning 70.

Okay. I've got to write
M-Sec's remarks

05:32.181 --> 05:35.828
for the signing in Kabul.
I'm only one man.

05:35.852 --> 05:39.832
Remarks for Kabul, useless
unappreciated gift for Mom...

05:39.856 --> 05:40.999
see what I'm saying?

05:41.023 --> 05:42.401
Well, maybe don't go
with something so useless.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.203
Or maybe just wait
for another birthday.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.604
I mean, she's probably
gonna live forever, right?

05:45.628 --> 05:47.439
Damn it. Okay,
I-I'll get the work done,

05:47.463 --> 05:48.807

No. It's not my job anymore.

Yeah, our turf, but now

about the food and who supplied it.
Genius.

Yeah. It's gonna leave

in Kabul for the secretary

06:35.645 --> 06:37.256

06:37.280 --> 06:41.326
Amina Salah... the former
Afghan minister of education,

who lost her job in the peace deal

06:43.052 --> 06:44.596

Okay, now you're just showing off.
Yep.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.068
Okay, everyone. Fill your plates
and find your seats.

06:50.092 --> 06:53.238
And we can thank
Secretary Becker when he arrives

06:53.262 --> 06:55.040
for this generous spread.

06:55.064 --> 06:57.009
I-I... Gordon, I hear you.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.544
But there's been relative peace

06:58.568 --> 07:00.245
in Afghanistan for over a year,

07:00.269 --> 07:03.081
and contrary to our biggest concerns,

07:03.105 --> 07:05.250
Taliban has not taken
over the government.

07:05.274 --> 07:06.351
Then you haven't heard me.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.619
'Cause the hardliners
are already pushing back

07:07.643 --> 07:09.354
on the conditions we put on 'em

to receive the aid package.
They're not gonna leave $10 billion

07:12.648 --> 07:14.326
sitting on the table.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.861
This is last-minute posturing.

07:15.885 --> 07:17.963
Look, I can admit,
the deal's turned out

07:17.987 --> 07:19.097
better than I expected,

07:19.121 --> 07:21.333
but it's a fragile peace.
I know.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.334
We've lost some good people

07:22.358 --> 07:24.036
to green-on-blue attacks.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.438
Well, we've lost far fewer soldiers

07:26.462 --> 07:27.873
than an all-out military attack

07:27.897 --> 07:29.508
would have cost us.
I-I know that.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.577
I-I understand the
benefits, Elizabeth.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.378
Believe me, I'm on
the side of the deal.

07:33.402 --> 07:35.081
Nobody wants the troops
home more than I do.

07:35.082 --> 07:35.963
I know.

07:35.964 --> 07:38.517
It's just my job to
anticipate the problems.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.374
I mean, I've always been open to it.

17:03.398 --> 17:07.711
Thanks. Sophie's always
been rigidly opposed.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.914
And we never

17:09.938 --> 17:12.983
talked about it much at all
until last month

17:13.007 --> 17:15.586
when I looked into sending Annie
to a private Catholic school,

17:15.609 --> 17:17.821
purely for the educational benefits,

17:17.846 --> 17:20.223
and Sophie completely freaked out.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.492
Accused me of wanting
to cloister her away

17:22.517 --> 17:24.194
with antiquated religious ideas

17:24.219 --> 17:25.829
about the role of women in society,

17:25.854 --> 17:30.367
something, something, and its
inherent poisonous patriarchy.

17:30.391 --> 17:32.703

I wanted to boil her in oil.

from that, and now suddenly

at the family table.

Well, I can tell you what
it's not about... religion.

17:48.843 --> 17:51.155
Mm.
I mean, come on,

17:51.179 --> 17:52.590
is that the only thing you guys

17:52.614 --> 17:53.891
have been fighting about recently?

17:53.915 --> 17:56.927
Because the tension
in the air seemed a little

17:56.951 --> 18:01.332
thick to be just an argument
about saying grace.

18:01.356 --> 18:04.224
Yeah. We fight all the time.

18:05.326 --> 18:07.738
We always have.

18:07.762 --> 18:11.509
The thing is, the making up...

18:11.533 --> 18:13.644

it can to ban social media,

but we both know repression
only feeds innovation.

Even if the parents are ambivalent,

19:20.435 --> 19:22.479
they get pressure from the community.

19:22.503 --> 19:25.049
Honor killing is a
marginalized custom,

19:25.073 --> 19:27.251
mostly found in the
more rural provinces

19:27.275 --> 19:29.520
where it can't accurately be policed.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.155
Some of our research indicates

19:31.179 --> 19:33.891
there has actually been
an uptick in the practice

19:33.915 --> 19:35.593
since you helped forge the deal

19:35.617 --> 19:37.728
with President Sharza's
government and the Taliban.

19:37.752 --> 19:40.965
Well, that contradicts the information

19:40.989 --> 19:43.367
the State Department received.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.203
Honor killings are reported
to be significantly down.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.738
It was a benchmark

19:47.762 --> 19:50.441
that the Afghan government had to meet

19:50.465 --> 19:52.309
in order to qualify
for the aid package.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.253

20:02.277 --> 20:05.122
on the ground who keep us informed.

20:05.146 --> 20:08.359

could be monumental

20:24.332 --> 20:26.043
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am,

First of all, we didn't take her.

20:36.844 --> 20:40.724
Farhana Radi came to us
asking for protection

20:40.748 --> 20:42.126
from an honor killing,

20:42.150 --> 20:44.628
a practice that is outlawed
in your country.

20:44.652 --> 20:47.698
Yes. It is easy to be disgusted
by such a barbaric practice.

20:47.722 --> 20:51.035
We have made progress,
but it's a strenuous process.

20:51.059 --> 20:53.971
I'm aware of that.
But isn't, isn't this

20:53.995 --> 20:57.274
the perfect opportunity
to take a strong stand?

20:57.298 --> 21:00.277
Hardly. I'm fighting day
and night to hold together

21:00.301 --> 21:01.478

21:01.502 --> 21:04.615
having the Taliban as
part of my government.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.450
Your actions with this girl put me

21:06.474 --> 21:08.652
and my government
in a precarious position.

21:08.676 --> 21:10.087
And we are working on a solution.

21:10.111 --> 21:11.522
There is no time.

21:11.546 --> 21:13.957
The story of the U.S.
Secretary of State

21:13.981 --> 21:16.093
allowing one of her staff
to kidnap an Afghan girl

21:16.117 --> 21:17.361
and keep her in the embassy

21:17.385 --> 21:19.530
is all over the news.

21:19.554 --> 21:22.232
And until this catastrophe
is resolved,

21:22.256 --> 21:25.169
consider the entire
Rebuild-Renew Agreement on hold.

21:25.193 --> 21:29.740
Mr. President,
I urge you to reconsider.

21:29.764 --> 21:31.809
This agreement is the solution

21:31.833 --> 21:34.712
to so many problems
for both our countries.

21:34.736 --> 21:38.349
Not to mention you'd be walking
away from $10 billion

21:38.373 --> 21:40.417
in economic aid.

21:40.441 --> 21:43.387
If you don't release
the girl to her family,

21:43.411 --> 21:45.122
the Taliban will seize the moment

21:45.146 --> 21:46.990
and paint a picture
of my government as weak.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.527
Then it will be only a matter
of time before they take over.

21:50.551 --> 21:51.895
Then what will happen?

21:51.919 --> 21:54.565
We will end up once again
mired in war and terrorism,

21:54.589 --> 21:56.790
and I cannot allow that.

its numbers in terms
of verified honor killings,

22:11.356 --> 22:13.568
the true numbers are underreported.

22:13.592 --> 22:15.002
I got in touch with some contacts

22:15.026 --> 22:18.206
on the ground there...
NGOs and medical examiners...

22:18.230 --> 22:20.875
and the truth is,
the Afghan government gathers

22:20.899 --> 22:23.244
its info from police departments
and medical examiners.

22:23.268 --> 22:25.713
And, big surprise,
these government employees

22:25.737 --> 22:27.682
aren't always pressured
to be absolutely accurate

22:27.706 --> 22:29.550
about the cause of death
for many young women.

22:29.574 --> 22:31.819
So, if you release Farhana
and she were to die

22:31.843 --> 22:33.287
at the hands of her family,

22:33.311 --> 22:35.923
there's a good chance it'll
be reported as something else.

In here.

<font color="#80ffff">(SINGSONGY)</font> Surprise.

38:38.731 --> 38:40.241
Henry told me.

38:40.265 --> 38:41.799
How was Afghanistan?

38:44.069 --> 38:45.914
Harrowing.

38:45.938 --> 38:48.049
Speaking of...

38:48.073 --> 38:50.251

If the name of the game
is beat up on Will,

38:54.179 --> 38:56.581
I'm way ahead of you.
I didn't mean it like that.

38:58.550 --> 39:00.651
Just worried about you.

39:01.654 --> 39:04.599
And disappointed in me.

39:04.623 --> 39:06.134
No.

39:06.158 --> 39:08.403
No?
Come on.

<font color="#80ffff">(SIGHS)</font> I'm...

about how to be married?

39:23.676 --> 39:26.655
I was 13 when my role models died.

39:26.679 --> 39:29.257
It-it just...

39:29.281 --> 39:30.992
it just looked like

39:31.016 --> 39:33.395
you find someone
who doesn't drive you crazy,

39:33.419 --> 39:35.430
and then you have dinner,

39:35.454 --> 39:39.334
talk about work, watch TV.

39:39.358 --> 39:42.137
Or you-you play Scrabble.

39:42.161 --> 39:44.929
Sometimes go on vacations. They...

39:45.931 --> 39:49.010
...they made it look easy,

39:49.034 --> 39:51.212
I guess, and...

39:51.236 --> 39:54.616
the minute my marriage wasn't easy,

39:54.640 --> 39:58.119
I-I thought
I was doing it wrong, or...

39:58.143 --> 40:00.488
she was.

40:00.512 --> 40:03.014
They fought plenty.

40:04.016 --> 40:05.427
Uh-huh.
Sure.

40:05.451 --> 40:06.661
Come on.

40:06.685 --> 40:09.531
Mm, nothing serious.

parents visiting again?

40:18.430 --> 40:20.731
Will.

40:22.601 --> 40:25.947
You were younger, so you
idealized them more.

40:25.971 --> 40:28.383
Or paid less attention.

40:28.407 --> 40:30.719
Well, you figured it out.

40:30.743 --> 40:31.886
Somehow.

40:31.910 --> 40:33.354
Henry and I

40:33.378 --> 40:35.356
often joke that we were fixed up

40:35.380 --> 40:38.293
by a couple of romantic idiots
in their 20s.

40:38.317 --> 40:40.061
Happened to work.

40:40.085 --> 40:41.963
That's because you work at it.

40:41.987 --> 40:43.198
That, too.

40:43.222 --> 40:44.866
Yeah.
Yeah.

Marriage is...

40:51.597 --> 40:54.075
a mystery.

40:54.099 --> 40:55.376
And a miracle...

40:55.400 --> 40:56.878
And an ordeal.
That is

40:56.902 --> 40:59.748
exactly what Henry says.
Right.

40:59.772 --> 41:02.974
You guys <i>did</i> do some bonding.
We did, yeah.

Listen, I'm sorry if I...

...parent you.

41:10.249 --> 41:12.761
It's not my job anymore,

41:12.785 --> 41:15.152
and I'm gonna let it go.

They all went to dinner.

41:23.862 --> 41:25.540
They said they'd bring you back

41:25.564 --> 41:27.108

I can't. I can't take it.

41:37.342 --> 41:39.888
I can't just stand here

At-at least let me.

Just don't get any shell in there.

41:55.761 --> 41:57.305
And that is not parental.

41:57.329 --> 41:59.574
It's just advice.

41:59.598 --> 42:02.033
Okay, I'm gonna back off now.
