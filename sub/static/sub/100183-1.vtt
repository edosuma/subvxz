00:01.936 --> 00:03.952
<i>Last season</i>
<i>on</i> Black Lightning...

00:04.029 --> 00:05.673
You've been classified
a clear and present meta-human
threat to national security.

00:05.697 --> 00:08.331
The Pit is a black site
which exists on no map

00:08.408 --> 00:09.888
<i>and from which
there is no escape.</i>

00:09.943 --> 00:11.813
<i>I've been studying
Green Light for some time now.</i>

00:11.837 --> 00:14.963
And I understand
its components
and neurological effects

00:15.040 --> 00:16.506
better than anyone.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.892
<i>Ever since I came back alive</i>

00:18.969 --> 00:21.022
<i>and when I'm around people</i>
<i>and when I look at them,</i>
<i>it makes them tell the truth.</i>

00:21.046 --> 00:22.398
I don't want anything
to do with you.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.522
Mom.

00:24.716 --> 00:25.716
I'm sorry.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.685
Oh, my God.
Stand back!

00:28.762 --> 00:30.353
Those meta-humans
are out of the pods.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.897
<i>Odell's gonna wanna claim them.</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:33.690
<i>You are close to stabilizing</i>

00:33.767 --> 00:36.026
the pod kids,
the Markovians know it.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.652
And if they can obtain you

00:37.729 --> 00:41.990
and force you to do the same
for their meta-human army...

00:42.001 --> 00:43.909
They'd be
the most powerful country
in the world.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.203
I'm swearing in
Black Lightning, Thunder,

00:46.279 --> 00:47.537
and whatever you're calling
yourself.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.424
The Markovian War is coming.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.551
And Freeland is ground zero.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.566
<i>Name.</i>

01:09.136 --> 01:10.602
Maryam Luqman.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.029
<i>Date of birth.</i>

01:12.764 --> 01:14.865
April 16th, 2004.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.077
<i>Confirm.</i>

01:29.781 --> 01:32.749
<i>Confirmed.
Your enhancement?</i>

01:32.826 --> 01:35.210
I don't know
the technical name for it,

01:35.287 --> 01:36.807
but I can blend into
any environment,

01:37.831 --> 01:39.098
basically making me invisible.

01:39.958 --> 01:41.216
Like a chameleon.

01:41.293 --> 01:42.562
<i>When did you start using
Green Light?</i>

01:42.586 --> 01:44.010
I didn't.

01:44.087 --> 01:45.595
I've been here almost a month

01:45.672 --> 01:46.805
and you ask me

01:46.816 --> 01:47.940
the same questions.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.011
I go...

01:53.989 --> 01:55.272
I went

01:55.348 --> 01:57.116
to a private school, Chatiers.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.085
Most of the kids
there were white,

02:01.188 --> 02:02.871
so everything
about me stood out.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.328
Kids learn about Muslims
on social media

02:10.339 --> 02:12.214
and the news,
and they make comments.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.801
"Is that a bomb
in your backpack?"

02:17.537 --> 02:20.005
They filled my locker
with pork ribs,

02:20.015 --> 02:22.891
and they would call me names
like "Bacon Slice."

02:26.046 --> 02:27.046
Anyway, I...

02:30.217 --> 02:32.609
The school, they were
having a gym party,

02:34.196 --> 02:35.865
and I wanted to go
and, for the first time,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.049
my parents said that I could.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.535
My friends and some boys,

02:41.612 --> 02:42.861
they thought it would be funny

02:42.872 --> 02:44.329
to put Green Light in my food.

02:45.690 --> 02:46.999
Of course, I flipped out,

02:49.236 --> 02:51.214
they accused me of using drugs,
kicked me out of school,

02:51.238 --> 02:52.932
and by the time that
the girls could confess

02:52.956 --> 02:55.799
what they did,
it was already too late.

02:57.127 --> 02:58.487
They had already
put me in a pod.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.046
<i>Name.</i>

03:01.056 --> 03:02.264
You know my name.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.060

03:06.970 --> 03:08.187

03:09.231 --> 03:10.439

03:26.940 --> 03:28.698
<i>Confirmed.</i>

03:28.775 --> 03:30.492
<i>Your enhancement?</i>

03:30.568 --> 03:32.252
I don't have
no enhancements, man.

03:32.329 --> 03:34.329
I don't got powers,
I don't got none of that, man.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.708
Look at me. Do I look like
I got enhancements?

03:38.785 --> 03:40.096
Only enhancements
I got is hypertension

03:40.120 --> 03:42.095
and type two diabetes.

03:42.172 --> 03:44.589
<i>When did you start
using Green Light?</i>

03:44.600 --> 03:45.907
You gotta be...

03:45.909 --> 03:47.709
Yo, when y'all
gonna let me out of here, man?

03:49.587 --> 03:50.587

<i>Confirm.</i>

04:13.903 --> 04:14.920
<i>Confirmed.</i>

04:19.534 --> 04:20.616
No.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.420
I'm not answering
another damn question

04:23.496 --> 04:25.430
until I speak to my family.

04:30.721 --> 04:32.354
My father took me to the clinic

04:33.840 --> 04:35.440
to get the vaccine and...

04:49.356 --> 04:52.124
<i>Please return to your NICHE
and you will be emancipated.</i>

04:55.695 --> 04:57.829
<i>♪ Last night</i>
<i>I saw a superhero</i>
<i>He was black ♪</i>

04:57.840 --> 05:01.750
<i>♪ He said,</i>
<i>"This is for the street</i>
<i>Black Lightning's back" ♪</i>

05:01.826 --> 05:04.085
It's been precisely 37 days
since the children

05:04.162 --> 05:06.004
escaped from their pods
and most of them

05:06.015 --> 05:07.505
have not been located.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.849
The government's reaction?

05:08.925 --> 05:11.134
Separating any suspected child
from their parents,

05:11.211 --> 05:12.844
and putting them
into detainment facilities

05:12.855 --> 05:14.346
like the one behind me
until they've been

05:14.356 --> 05:16.473
cleared of the meta gene.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.475
Just moments ago
we were told by a source

05:18.551 --> 05:20.351
that Deputy Chief Henderson
will be holding

05:20.387 --> 05:22.312
a press conference
later today regarding

05:22.389 --> 05:24.147
the government's quarantine
of Freeland.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.523
We hit the streets
of Freeland to see

05:25.534 --> 05:27.317
how its residents are reacting.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.869
Where is Black Lightning?

05:28.945 --> 05:30.019
I don't see him.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.655
I blame his black ass,
that's right.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.824
Soon as he come back,
got all these soldiers

05:34.901 --> 05:36.034
rolling up in these streets,

05:36.045 --> 05:37.535
arresting anybody they want,

05:37.546 --> 05:39.371
they don't care nothin'
about our community.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.214
People just gonna have
to face the fact

05:41.291 --> 05:43.041
that Black Lightning is dead.

05:43.052 --> 05:45.552
And that Blackbird has taken
his place.

05:45.629 --> 05:48.671
She cares more
about the people anyway.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.007
<i>And that's the overriding
question in the streets.</i>

05:51.084 --> 05:52.358
<i>Has Black Lightning, who appears</i>

05:52.360 --> 05:54.043
<i>to have abandoned
the city again,</i>

05:54.121 --> 05:56.513
<i>been replaced by the woman
people are calling Blackbird.</i>

05:56.589 --> 05:58.523
<i>I'm Jamillah Olsen,
for Clap Back News.</i>

06:09.745 --> 06:11.027
I'm scared.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.121
- Easy now.
- -I'm scared.

06:14.232 --> 06:15.248
Back up.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.552
This right here

06:28.371 --> 06:29.471
is an abomination.

06:31.082 --> 06:32.757
Really is.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.569
Freeze.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.788
Stay where you are.
Stop now.

06:56.483 --> 06:59.084
Get on the ground.
We will shoot you.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.586
Light his ass up.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.020
Ned?

07:27.889 --> 07:29.156
Ned Creegan?

07:34.354 --> 07:36.371
I prefer Cyclotronic.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.491
Cyclotronic?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.460
That's funny.

07:41.870 --> 07:42.994
Ned.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.379
Why all you metas gotta come up

07:44.456 --> 07:47.457
with these corny ass names
for yourselves?

07:47.534 --> 07:48.636
You about to give me another one

07:48.660 --> 07:49.825
of your speeches, Commander?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.837
You abandoned
your sisters, your brothers,

07:52.848 --> 07:54.756
- and your country...
- The only time

07:54.832 --> 07:57.133
my country ever cared about me

07:57.210 --> 07:59.719
was when they found out
I had powers.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.189
Did they try and cure me?

08:03.216 --> 08:04.216
Help me?

08:05.602 --> 08:06.768
No.

08:06.844 --> 08:09.229
They put me in every
war zone on this planet,

08:09.305 --> 08:12.199
killing over and over
and over again.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.025
- You were a soldier.
- Come on.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.535
I was a petty criminal.

08:15.612 --> 08:17.111
Doing time for stealing
a minivan.

08:17.188 --> 08:19.206
Not a murderer, an assassin.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.916
You made me that.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.293
That's true.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.912
I did.

08:25.989 --> 08:29.508
And I have to take
full responsibility.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.677
No.

08:33.955 --> 08:35.013
Uh-huh.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.939
Markovians breached the compound

09:34.950 --> 09:37.909
with a special ops
strike team and one meta.

09:37.986 --> 09:39.110
All dead.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.946
<i>- The children?</i>
- All accounted for.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.415
<i>Put Freeland on lock down.</i>

09:43.959 --> 09:44.959
Copy.

09:47.612 --> 09:49.296
I'm Commander Carson Williams.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.049
Welcome.

10:20.812 --> 10:22.048
You know those children
aren't getting out

10:22.072 --> 10:24.155
of that place anytime soon.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.167
And maybe you guys are used
to seeing this kind of stuff,
but I'm not.

10:27.243 --> 10:29.077
That was a war zone back there.

10:29.153 --> 10:32.080
That Cylophonic, tronick,
whatever the hell his name was,

10:32.156 --> 10:33.790
he was trying
to get to those kids.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.844
And we're just riding back
like nothing happened?

10:35.868 --> 10:37.752
Some of those children
came from the clinic.

10:37.829 --> 10:39.295
Is that a coincidence?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.297
Betty, you are a nurse.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.216
Just do your job.

10:43.292 --> 10:45.352
How they got there,
what happens to them

10:45.428 --> 10:48.638
is up to the government,
not you and not me.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.473
Has the clinic
become one more place

10:50.550 --> 10:52.078
to identify metas,
then turn them over

10:52.102 --> 10:53.601
to the government?

10:53.678 --> 10:56.771
We were there with
the good Reverend
and the Congresswoman

10:56.848 --> 10:58.189
to make sure the government

10:58.200 --> 11:00.367
is treating
those children humanely

11:00.443 --> 11:01.776
and according to the law.

11:01.853 --> 11:03.370
You think that's humane,

11:03.446 --> 11:05.613
collars on their necks
like dogs?

11:05.690 --> 11:07.365
Anissa, you're okay with this?

11:07.376 --> 11:09.042
Of course not.

11:09.119 --> 11:10.609
- Stop the van.
- Betty, wait.

11:10.687 --> 11:13.371
I'm not gonna be
a part of this,
it's wrong, Anissa.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.290
It's wrong, that thing attacked
the facility for a reason,

11:16.367 --> 11:18.126
and these idiots,
including this bitch

11:18.202 --> 11:19.555
sitting in the front seat
of this van,

11:19.579 --> 11:21.003
know more than she's telling us.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.441
Those are children
being separated

11:22.465 --> 11:23.948
from their families.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.103
And ain't no telling
what happened
to their parents.

11:26.127 --> 11:28.845
Betty, don't. Betty, what,
are you gonna walk? Betty.

11:28.921 --> 11:29.979
Betty, come back.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.525
The door is open
if you wanna follow her.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.024
I don't give two shakes
of a lamb's ass

11:42.101 --> 11:43.901
what you need or what you want.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.987
There's no way
I'm going on television

11:46.063 --> 11:47.864
and letting myself
or this department

11:47.940 --> 11:50.032
become the face of
your experiment gone wrong.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.034
You will follow orders,
Deputy Chief.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.828
I'm not a part of
your damn army.

11:53.905 --> 11:55.913
You and everything,

11:55.990 --> 11:59.083
from the heavens
to the smallest crawling thing

11:59.094 --> 12:02.554
in this stain on
the map you call a city,

12:03.414 --> 12:04.723
is under my command.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.266
And either you will
follow orders,

12:06.342 --> 12:09.552
or I will find the next person
in line for your job do it,

12:09.629 --> 12:11.438
fire your black ass,
and make sure

12:11.514 --> 12:12.664
you don't find another job

12:12.666 --> 12:15.433
until you've defaulted
on your mortgage,

12:15.444 --> 12:17.277
your daughter's
school tuition dries up,

12:18.179 --> 12:20.822
and your wife leaves you.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.619
- Hey.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.834
Hey, enough.

12:33.661 --> 12:34.661
Get off of me.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.134
I'm guessing
you don't understand

12:39.158 --> 12:41.384
the situation, Deputy Chief.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.961
This ain't no damn street fight,

12:43.972 --> 12:46.923
this country is
on the brink of war.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.809
How we handle this crisis
in Freeland will determine

12:49.886 --> 12:51.636
the future of warfare.

12:51.712 --> 12:54.856
Now you either with us,
or you with them.

12:57.343 --> 13:01.446
News conference before
the day is out.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.640
Wait, what are you doing,
they're watching?

13:28.716 --> 13:30.299
- I don't care.
I missed you.
-Oh.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.260
Besides, I'm horny as hell.

13:32.336 --> 13:34.011
I missed you too.
Okay.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.513
Can we go home?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.431
Well, you gotta get
out of this suit, don't you?

13:37.442 --> 13:39.475
- Yes.
- So then let me help you.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.823
Sorry to interrupt.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.869
What the hell is your problem?

13:49.946 --> 13:52.872
There was a Markovian attack
on one of our facilities today.

13:52.949 --> 13:55.491
They sent in a strike team
and a meta

13:55.568 --> 13:58.286
to try to take the children.

13:58.362 --> 14:00.037
Well, sounds like
a personal problem to me.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.873
Not really, Mr. Pierce.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.333
There is a clear and present
Markovian threat,

14:04.410 --> 14:06.502
and until that is eliminated,

14:06.579 --> 14:09.055
we cannot allow you to leave.

14:09.132 --> 14:10.515
Or you, Dr. Stewart.

14:10.592 --> 14:11.799
What?

14:11.876 --> 14:13.395
Whoa, law, you don't get to
say a damn thing

14:13.419 --> 14:14.786
about what my wife can do.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.897
The only person more valuable
than Black Lightning

14:17.974 --> 14:21.183
at this point in time
is your wife.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.486
They already have Dr. Jace.

14:23.563 --> 14:27.398
So consider this protective
custody for your good

14:27.409 --> 14:30.568
and the greater good
of the country.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.079
Agent Odell, now I only
came here because

14:33.156 --> 14:37.083
we agreed that my girls,
my wife, would be left alone.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.254
And you made the best decision
for you and your family.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.245
Yeah, well,
my patience is running thin.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.498
Believe me,
you don't want to see me
when I lose my patience.

14:44.575 --> 14:47.710
I'd like to see that,
just not now.

14:47.787 --> 14:51.255
But as a gesture of good faith,

14:51.266 --> 14:53.224
- go ahead, you can take
that off now.

15:00.591 --> 15:01.733
Have a, um...

15:03.278 --> 15:04.278
good night.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.401
<i>An 8:30 pm curfew
begins immediately.</i>

15:12.478 --> 15:14.236
<i>Anyone found on
the streets of Freeland</i>

15:14.313 --> 15:15.622
<i>without the proper paperwork</i>

15:15.698 --> 15:18.574
<i>will be subject to arrest
or prosecution.</i>

15:18.651 --> 15:21.535
<i>Freeland PD is working closely
with the ASA</i>

15:21.612 --> 15:25.247
<i>to help Freeland get through
these extreme circumstances.</i>

15:25.324 --> 15:27.926
<i>So, we ask the public
to please cooperate.</i>

15:28.002 --> 15:30.252
<i>If you see anything
or hear anything</i>

15:30.329 --> 15:32.162
<i>that you feel will lead
to meta engagement,</i>

15:32.164 --> 15:36.801
<i>- please call our hotline
at 1-800-55...</i>

15:36.811 --> 15:38.803
It's getting worse.

15:38.879 --> 15:40.605
God, I'm so glad
Dad's coming home.

15:41.173 --> 15:42.440
Me too.

15:43.393 --> 15:45.193
Man, this is all so bizarre.

15:46.887 --> 15:49.322
<i>Code word "bizarre" confirmed.</i>

15:49.399 --> 15:50.657
Call Gambi.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.942
<i>-Calling Gambi. Call secured.</i>

15:53.019 --> 15:56.445
- Girl, Gambi pimped
your ride out.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.948
- <i>I'm here.</i>
- All the kids are in cages.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.909
Metas everywhere,
military everywhere,

16:01.986 --> 16:04.087
Yo, it had to be at least
50 of them.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.340
Betty's face and Ms. Reek's
smug, satisfied face...

16:07.417 --> 16:10.751
Ooh, I swear it took everything
I had not to

16:10.828 --> 16:11.961
go off up in there.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.629
We need you
in that clinic, Anissa.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.067
It's a hot spot
for identifying metas,

16:15.091 --> 16:16.966
so you did the right thing.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.300
Soon as your father gets home

16:18.377 --> 16:19.688
we'll come up
with a plan for the facility

16:19.712 --> 16:21.336
to get those kids out.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.305
<i>Oh, and there was
a new meta there as well.</i>

16:23.382 --> 16:26.308
<i>He said his name was,
uh, Cyclotronic?</i>

16:26.385 --> 16:28.936
He can make things
disintegrate into nothingness.

16:29.013 --> 16:30.813
It was just like
this weird black ash,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.940
<i>then this Commander
Carson Williams</i>

16:33.017 --> 16:35.952
called the meta
by his real name,
uh, Ned Creegan?

16:36.029 --> 16:37.820
<i>All of it was crazy.</i>

16:37.831 --> 16:39.447
I gotta go, Anissa.

16:39.523 --> 16:41.198
<i>I may have found a weakness
in the ASA's perimeter.</i>

16:41.209 --> 16:42.500
<i>Talk soon.</i>

17:11.097 --> 17:13.564
<i>Anissa, good to see you.</i>

17:13.575 --> 17:16.534
<i>-Would you like for me</i>
<i>to turn on the lights?</i>
- Yes, please.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.246
- Shonda.
<i>- What's up?</i>

17:20.323 --> 17:23.324
- Play Chaka Khan.
<i>- Of course.</i>

17:35.263 --> 17:38.097
<i>♪ I will love you anyway ♪</i>

17:38.174 --> 17:40.883
<i>♪ Even if you cannot stay ♪</i>

17:40.960 --> 17:44.437

17:44.514 --> 17:47.440
<i>♪ Here is where

18:05.293 --> 18:07.126
- Mirror, mirror.
<i>- Of course.</i>

18:22.626 --> 18:24.301
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, Uncle Gambi.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.870
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

18:25.872 --> 18:27.972
Okay. But listen,
Dad was supposed
to come home today.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.649
Odell stopped by the house

18:29.725 --> 18:31.537
and said that Mom and Dad
have to stay with the ASA,

18:31.561 --> 18:33.486
<i>something about helping
fight the Markovians.</i>

18:33.563 --> 18:34.979
Your mother's research
is important

18:34.989 --> 18:37.064
to understanding
and controlling these metas

18:37.141 --> 18:39.650
and your father
is biologically priceless.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.569
Odell is protecting his assets.

18:41.645 --> 18:43.195
Okay, so what do we do?

18:43.272 --> 18:44.446
We follow the plan.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.990
Your father can
take care of himself,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and your mother certainly
can hold her own.

18:48.077 --> 18:49.836
We have to continue
to destabilize

18:49.912 --> 18:52.171
the ASA's presence in Freeland.

18:52.248 --> 18:55.166
The soldier you saw
at the facility is
Commander Williams.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.095
He's like your father
in that he is a product of

18:57.119 --> 18:59.512
the original vaccine trials.

18:59.589 --> 19:01.505
He's a meta
that can mimic the powers

19:01.516 --> 19:03.674
of any other meta that
he comes in contact with.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.686
Sheesh, that's
a hell of a power to have.

19:06.762 --> 19:08.407
<i>He needs a special serum
to keep him healthy.</i>

19:08.431 --> 19:11.015
<i>He's basically got
sickle cell for metas.</i>

19:11.091 --> 19:13.809
The other meta you saw is
exactly who Williams
said he was,

19:13.886 --> 19:16.312
Ned Creegan, Cyclotronic man.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.355
He was a part of
the government's
meta force project

19:18.366 --> 19:19.815
that was run by Williams.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.332
<i>I found an ASA convoy with metas</i>

19:21.393 --> 19:22.860
<i>heading to the detention center.</i>

19:22.871 --> 19:24.612
<i>I need you to intercept it.</i>

19:24.688 --> 19:27.948
The window of opportunity
is small, but will be fruitful.

19:28.025 --> 19:29.600
Okay.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.620
<i>Everything you need
is on your computer screen.</i>

19:32.696 --> 19:35.173
<i>- Jennifer all set?</i>
- Yep, she's at the house.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.750
<i>Excellent.</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:39.835
<i>- Be careful out there.</i>
- Got it.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.095
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

20:03.227 --> 20:04.285
Down on the ground...

20:05.321 --> 20:07.330
- Freeze.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.844
I hope you all don't mind.

20:30.921 --> 20:32.688
We gonna take us a small detour.

20:40.014 --> 20:41.030
These days,

20:42.599 --> 20:43.783
everything's live...

20:44.476 --> 20:46.235
in HD.

20:46.312 --> 20:49.121
And we're watching it
like it's a form of
entertainment.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.249
Like it's a reality show.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.460
We see kids in cages.

20:55.871 --> 20:59.790
We see children
taken from their parents.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.918
Some of them may never
ever see their parents again.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.878
Now, does that sound
familiar to you?

21:04.955 --> 21:08.140
But the president
and his administration say
they're breaking the law.

21:08.217 --> 21:09.842
What laws
are these children breaking?

21:09.918 --> 21:12.136
- They say the parents are
breaking the law.
-How?

21:12.212 --> 21:14.305
All the parents are trying to do

21:14.381 --> 21:16.223
is get their children
out of Freeland,

21:16.234 --> 21:19.485
so that they won't be
taken away because
they might be a meta.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.822
Not long ago, Jim Crow

21:22.898 --> 21:25.116
was the law of the land.

21:25.192 --> 21:28.369
Laws are not infallible,
my dear. Remember that.

21:30.814 --> 21:32.197
Listen, I gotta stop now.

21:32.274 --> 21:33.949
Just one more question.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.744
Blackbird stole a bus
transporting people.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.131
No one knows what happened
to those people,

21:38.155 --> 21:39.913
and several soldiers
are near death.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.656
What do you think
about her actions?

21:41.734 --> 21:44.021
We don't know what happened
to Black Lightning,
if he's dead.

21:44.045 --> 21:45.886
We don't know what happened
to Thunder.

21:45.963 --> 21:48.672
But it is good to know
that we have somebody
out in them streets

21:48.683 --> 21:49.757
fighting for the people.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.273
Even though she's
breaking the law?

21:52.544 --> 21:55.813
See, there you go
with that "law" again.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.692
I'mma pray for you, sister.

21:59.769 --> 22:00.860
Thank you, Reverend Holt.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.445
It's good to see you.

22:11.522 --> 22:13.364
I was just talking about you.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.157
You're a celebrity now,
young lady.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.376
Everybody's a celebrity
nowadays, Rev.

22:17.453 --> 22:19.879
I don't know about that.

22:19.955 --> 22:21.255
- Listen.
- Yeah.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.132
Be ready,

22:23.209 --> 22:25.167
we'll get them through
and across soon.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.752
It's gotta be soon.

22:26.829 --> 22:29.338
Room is getting crowded,

22:29.415 --> 22:32.641
and a room full of
scared meta children
ain't a good combination.

22:32.718 --> 22:33.768
I hear you.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.903
People are saying
Black Lightning's dead.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.411
Feels like he is in here.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.759
Excellent work.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.203
How's everyone holding up?

23:59.205 --> 24:01.805
Oh, we gotta get them
out of Holt's church, ASAP.

24:01.882 --> 24:03.234
It's getting crowded,
and a lot of them

24:03.258 --> 24:04.870
are losing their faith
and their patience.

24:04.894 --> 24:07.489
The hole in the perimeter
should be big enough
by tomorrow night.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.188
All right, good.

24:09.264 --> 24:12.691
Wait. You, uh,
you had something
you wanted to show me?

24:12.768 --> 24:14.243
I picked this up
a few moments ago.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.947
<i>Cap, I, uh...
what the hell?</i>

24:19.024 --> 24:20.583
<i>Spit it out, Barnes.</i>

24:20.659 --> 24:23.785
<i>Uh, Cap, a leopard
just ate Sergeant Thomas.</i>

24:23.862 --> 24:25.287
<i>- A what?
- A leopard.</i>

24:25.364 --> 24:26.663
<i>It just ate, Sergeant...</i>

24:27.991 --> 24:29.124
<i>No!</i>

24:29.201 --> 24:30.553
It was a little odd
to say the least,

24:30.577 --> 24:31.594
so I took a look around.

24:46.552 --> 24:47.552
That's Grace.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.205
Another one?

24:58.897 --> 24:59.997
Yeah.

25:08.699 --> 25:09.699
Thank you.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.582
Hey.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.084
Hi.

25:22.546 --> 25:25.186
You were at
the detention center today
with the clinic delegation.

25:28.302 --> 25:32.020
Sorry, I'm...
I'm Jamillah Olsen.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.022
I'm a reporter
for Clap Back News.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.466
In town, I thought,
for a couple of days,

25:35.468 --> 25:39.027
but now that no one can
go in or out, kinda stuck.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.163
You always come to bars
lookin' for stories?

25:41.607 --> 25:42.607
No.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.378
I come to bars looking
for a beautiful woman
like you to talk to.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.247
Talk?

25:50.324 --> 25:52.383
- Yeah, talk.
-Okay, so you
shooting your shot.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.293
Maybe.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.123
You're a reporter?

25:59.958 --> 26:00.958
Indeed.

26:04.921 --> 26:08.682
So, if you're trying
to find somebody
who doesn't want to be found,

26:08.759 --> 26:10.225
how do you go about that?

26:10.302 --> 26:11.527
Depends on the person.

26:12.387 --> 26:13.467
You trying to find someone?

26:18.619 --> 26:19.619
I am.

26:33.533 --> 26:34.969
I don't usually do
this kind of thing.

26:34.993 --> 26:35.993
I'm not judging.

26:36.953 --> 26:38.433
- I don't do it that often.
- Okay.

26:39.539 --> 26:41.590
I mean...
I'm just saying that...

26:41.667 --> 26:44.760
Damn it, woman, this is not
an interview. Okay?

26:44.836 --> 26:45.936
Just nervous, I guess.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.105
Don't be. Come here.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.020
You okay?

27:06.692 --> 27:07.750
Yeah.

27:09.027 --> 27:10.619
That didn't sound
very convincing.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.177
When I went to the bar...

27:20.348 --> 27:21.797
I was hoping to...

27:21.873 --> 27:23.140
Run into your ex, Grace?

27:24.343 --> 27:25.717
Right, I told you.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.972
Now I'm here with you,

27:31.049 --> 27:33.233
and it's like, what am I
even doing? Like...

27:35.020 --> 27:36.153
It's called loneliness.

27:37.889 --> 27:38.947
That's why you're here.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.817
I suffer from it as well,

27:41.893 --> 27:44.536
and you shouldn't feel bad
for wanting a cure,
because it hurts.

27:49.451 --> 27:51.418
No pressure, but...

27:53.572 --> 27:57.091
I'm here if you ever want
to get another drink or talk.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.283
'Cause whatever this is...

28:01.514 --> 28:02.514
it's good.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.446
I've been talking
to some of the people
in the community.

28:08.470 --> 28:10.512
They think

28:10.589 --> 28:14.358
the clinic is being turned into
a place where they identify
possible metas

28:15.927 --> 28:16.927
for the government.

28:17.405 --> 28:18.405
Hmm.

28:22.267 --> 28:25.193
You know people think a lot.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.578
Like I thought...

28:26.655 --> 28:29.531
I thought that reporters
dealt in facts, not rumors?

28:29.542 --> 28:30.565
Ouch.

28:36.531 --> 28:37.531
Hey.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.426
Oh. Where is she?

28:42.788 --> 28:43.788
All right.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.598
This damn girl.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.706
<i>Please step in.</i>

29:34.005 --> 29:35.005
You winning or losing?

29:36.675 --> 29:37.682
Excuse me?

29:37.759 --> 29:38.817
You winning or losing?

29:40.178 --> 29:41.603
I always win.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.447
You mind if I sit down?

29:44.566 --> 29:45.616
Yeah, go for it.

29:49.571 --> 29:50.571
What's your name?

29:51.189 --> 29:52.614
Jennifer.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.282
Jennifer, it's nice to meet you.

29:54.359 --> 29:55.417
Nice to meet you, too.

29:57.362 --> 29:58.673
I guess if there's a bright side

29:58.697 --> 30:00.497
to all these police
and soldiers being around,

30:00.508 --> 30:03.135
it's at least we can walk
the streets without worrying
about the 100.

30:03.159 --> 30:04.902
There is that, but...

30:04.904 --> 30:07.139
you aren't afraid they may
pick you up one day,
put you in a camp?

30:07.163 --> 30:08.305
Nah.

30:09.758 --> 30:12.467
Okay, real talk? I'm like
crazy paranoid about it.

30:17.674 --> 30:18.674
Get in.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.903
I said get in.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.630
Oh, it's over, buddy.
Good night.

30:35.025 --> 30:36.124
Man...

30:39.371 --> 30:40.754
Turn that damn thing off.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.720
What the hell is wrong with you?

30:48.797 --> 30:51.006
Uncle Gambi did not make
that cloaking device

30:51.082 --> 30:52.435
so you could be
running the streets.

30:52.459 --> 30:53.925
You do know that
there's a curfew?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.680
Okay, so you just gonna not,
you ain't gonna say anything.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.348
- It hurts, Anissa.
- What?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.817
It hurts.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.227
My powers, they're growing
inside of me.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.678
And if I don't use them,
it hurts.

31:11.269 --> 31:12.494
Who was that boy?

31:12.571 --> 31:13.662
He was nobody.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.405
I met him
at the pizza joint, okay?

31:15.416 --> 31:17.532
He was walking me
to the metro, that's it.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.368
Look, I know
all of this is hard for you.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.713
You can't be just
a regular teenager.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.541
All that drama
since we was in that motel

31:26.618 --> 31:28.960
has robbed you
of any kind of normalcy.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.670
You don't deserve this.

31:30.747 --> 31:32.347
We don't always get
what we deserve.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.157
That's true.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.051
But, Jen, you can't be
out here like this.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.678
You don't know if that boy's
a spotter or what.

31:38.755 --> 31:41.565
We don't know when Odell plans
on letting Mom and Dad out.

31:42.425 --> 31:44.610
All we got is us.

31:45.887 --> 31:48.063
It's way too dangerous.

31:48.139 --> 31:49.898
I'm telling you right now
if I lose you,

31:49.975 --> 31:51.700
- I'm gonna lose my mind, girl.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.578
Seriously. So please, Jen,
for real.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.165
If you need to go out again,
just let me know.

31:58.784 --> 31:59.784
Promise me that.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.153
I promise.

32:04.322 --> 32:05.464
- I promise.
- All right.

32:06.324 --> 32:07.925
Come here.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.011
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.597
You know, the test...

32:14.666 --> 32:17.142
the experiments they did on me,

32:17.219 --> 32:19.603
must have opened a door
in me in some kind of way.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.764
Well, you've always
been able to see through...

32:22.841 --> 32:25.141
Yeah, but not without the suit.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.727
Gambi's tech was always
interfacing with my powers.

32:27.804 --> 32:31.031
This... This vision
comes from within.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.953
Like, naturally clearer.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.321
Tobias?

32:38.332 --> 32:40.281
In a bad shape.

32:40.358 --> 32:41.878
Doesn't look like
he's gonna make it.

32:42.244 --> 32:43.284
Issa?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.795
Oh, he looked fine.

32:46.197 --> 32:47.580
I need to talk to Odell.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.007
I need to see Issa.

32:49.084 --> 32:52.636
Lynn, you can't do that.

32:52.713 --> 32:54.849
The first thing he's gonna
want to know is
how you found out.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.014
Well, I'll lie.

32:56.091 --> 32:59.467
And if he uses Issa
to make you answer?

33:11.389 --> 33:12.389
You okay?

33:17.112 --> 33:18.112
I'm dying.

33:20.115 --> 33:21.164
How?

33:21.742 --> 33:22.742
Old age.

33:24.378 --> 33:25.877
Time catching up to me.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.090
<i>Where is the briefcase?</i>

33:36.056 --> 33:37.264
Where's the briefcase?

33:38.583 --> 33:39.883
Hidden.

33:39.959 --> 33:41.018
<i>Where?</i>

33:42.563 --> 33:43.687
Where?

33:44.923 --> 33:45.923
I don't know.

33:47.050 --> 33:48.525
Ask him again.

33:52.147 --> 33:53.521
Where's the briefcase?

33:53.598 --> 33:56.524
I don't know.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.412
<i>When's</i>
<i>the last time he saw</i>
<i>the briefcase?</i>

34:00.489 --> 34:02.405
When's the last time
you saw the briefcase?

34:02.482 --> 34:05.208
When that bitch Lightning
came flying through my window.

34:06.036 --> 34:08.378
What's in the briefcase?

34:09.447 --> 34:10.464
What's in the briefcase?

34:12.117 --> 34:13.277
I don't think you wanna know.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.043
Why?

34:15.120 --> 34:17.387
Because what's in it can...

34:19.882 --> 34:21.058
Ask him again.

34:26.348 --> 34:27.606
What's in the briefcase?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.443
Proctor wasn't a rogue agent.

34:40.454 --> 34:43.279
<i>He was always meant to be
a scapegoat.</i>

34:43.356 --> 34:46.074
Proctor was working directly
under orders from Odell,

34:46.150 --> 34:48.085
<i>who received his orders
from POTUS.</i>

34:50.112 --> 34:52.464
Odell was sent to Freeland
to follow three orders.

34:53.366 --> 34:55.467
Obtain all meta subjects.

34:55.543 --> 34:57.627
Turn the metas into weapons.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.130
And clean the Freeland project
of anything and anyone

35:00.140 --> 35:02.257
who could link POTUS
to the program.

35:26.149 --> 35:27.149
You're gonna kill me.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.953
So you can read minds now?

35:32.030 --> 35:34.548
No. Snakes bite.

35:37.702 --> 35:40.295
A lot of wisdom
for a kid like you.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.681
I stopped being a kid
as soon as I got these powers.

35:46.377 --> 35:47.510
Wish I had a choice.

35:49.005 --> 35:52.107
Your powers are
simple but devastating,

35:53.861 --> 35:55.569
and the truth is so rare

35:58.014 --> 35:59.489
and so dangerous.

36:06.356 --> 36:07.556
I thought you came to kill me?

36:14.572 --> 36:15.572
I did.

36:30.213 --> 36:31.971
I want to know
what Issa is doing here.

36:32.048 --> 36:34.566
He's here because
the Markovians have
no more use for him.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.018
Markovians?

36:37.095 --> 36:38.737
Yes, Mrs. Pierce,
the Markovians.

36:38.813 --> 36:41.356
The people I told you
we were at war with,

36:41.432 --> 36:43.775
the people who are trying
to destroy our country,

36:43.851 --> 36:46.152
the people who want to
either enslave

36:46.229 --> 36:48.863
or murder your children,
Mrs. Pierce.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.082
Yes, the damn Markovians.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.279
Apologies.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.214
It's been, as they say,

36:59.242 --> 37:00.258
one of those days.

37:02.837 --> 37:07.557
They kidnapped him
from his sister's home,

37:07.634 --> 37:10.810
tortured him for information
that he didn't have,
and left him for dead.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.054
What?

37:13.131 --> 37:14.764
I know this is hard.

37:14.775 --> 37:16.524
You cared deeply for him.

37:16.601 --> 37:20.353
If you'd like,
you can say your goodbyes

37:20.430 --> 37:22.030
before we turn him over
to his family.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.312
I'd like that.

37:29.981 --> 37:30.981
Thank you.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.083
I'll make it happen.

37:34.444 --> 37:36.077
Where the hell are we?

37:36.154 --> 37:39.455
Quiet! I told you,
people are listening.

37:39.466 --> 37:40.581
Don't be shushing me.

37:40.658 --> 37:41.967
I'm a grown-ass man,

37:42.043 --> 37:44.919
and I want to know
where the hell
are we going?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.755
There are
voice-activated sensors
in these woods.

37:47.832 --> 37:51.134
If you value
your daughter's life,
you'll shut the hell up.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.261
This could be
some kind of setup, y'all.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.648
We don't know
who's behind this mask

37:54.672 --> 37:56.072
and who she could be
working for.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.177
Sorry.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.200
Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:06.351 --> 38:07.826
Guys, come on. Let's go, quick.

38:07.902 --> 38:10.328
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

38:11.397 --> 38:12.822
<i>Jen?</i>

38:12.833 --> 38:13.957
Yeah, we're still clear.

38:24.377 --> 38:25.377
Oh, damn!

38:26.662 --> 38:29.597
Hey. You got 'em coming
from all sides and fast.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.537
Stand down.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.144
Is she all right?

39:34.581 --> 39:36.864
Not the right move, Jen.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.808
- Jen!
- What?

39:38.810 --> 39:41.588
The Markovians are hunting down
any metas they can get
their hands on.

39:41.612 --> 39:44.705
Uncle Gambi, you saw them
blow Anissa through that hole.
She could be dead.

39:44.782 --> 39:45.782
She could be.

39:47.577 --> 39:48.893
She could be.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.930
But we just have to wait,
do this the right way,

39:50.955 --> 39:54.015
so we don't endanger her,
you, or your parents.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.384
What's the point
of having powers
if I can't use 'em?

39:56.461 --> 39:57.718
I know this is tough,

39:57.795 --> 39:59.220
but this is
part of your training,

39:59.231 --> 40:00.438
probably the toughest part.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.148
Patience.

40:08.022 --> 40:09.022
What do we need to do?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.733
You go home, we wait.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.695
If we don't hear from Anissa
by tomorrow, we come up
with a plan

40:15.771 --> 40:16.955
to bring her back across.

40:29.660 --> 40:32.753
Mrs. Pierce, uh, Dr. Stewart,

40:32.830 --> 40:34.630
I know
what you must think of me,

40:34.641 --> 40:37.091
and to be honest,
it's probably all true.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.601
But what is also true

40:40.147 --> 40:42.814
that your chances
of dying a natural death

40:44.509 --> 40:45.733
are not good.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.768
You come from a family of metas

40:47.845 --> 40:51.698
and the Markovians
are hunting you.

40:51.774 --> 40:53.608
So, believe me when I say

40:53.684 --> 40:55.776
that you and your family

40:55.853 --> 40:58.329
are in the best hands possible.

40:59.899 --> 41:00.915
Mine.

41:32.390 --> 41:33.698
Damn.
