00:43.600 --> 00:46.922
<i>My parents
say there's no such thing as a bad day.</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:49.361
<i>That it's all how you look at it.</i>

00:49.440 --> 00:51.886
<i>What can I tell you? Parents.</i>

00:53.080 --> 00:54.320
<i>Here is what I know.</i>

00:54.960 --> 00:56.803
<i>They're wrong.</i>

00:56.880 --> 01:01.169
<i>My name is Alexander,
and I'm the expert in bad days.</i>

01:01.200 --> 01:05.330
<i>This guy knows what I'm talking about.
That's not coming off.</i>

01:05.400 --> 01:09.246
<i>Did I mention my dad
is a relentless optimist?</i>

01:09.320 --> 01:10.606
We're in the home stretch.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.641
<i>And look at Mom.</i>

01:11.720 --> 01:14.451
<i>She's not fooling anyone
with that "Mom smile."</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:20.810
<i>Believe it or not,
by the time we got home...</i>

01:20.840 --> 01:23.161
<i>this van was in better
shape than we were.</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:27.087
<i>There's my sister Emily, the actress.</i>

01:29.520 --> 01:32.091
<i>Always ready to take a bow.</i>

01:32.160 --> 01:37.371
<i>Anthony, my brother, a total winner
with a great sense of style.</i>

01:38.560 --> 01:40.130
<i>And baby Trevor.</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:43.682
<i>Sorry, pal.
Definitely not coming off.</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:48.368
<i>Bottom line, today was an epic disaster.
The worst day possible.</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:50.647
<i>Everyone in my family would agree.</i>

01:50.680 --> 01:54.002
<i>But what they don't know,
is it was all my fault.</i>

01:54.040 --> 01:55.963
<i>And it wasn't over yet.</i>

02:29.080 --> 02:30.570
You overslept, bud.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.965
Don't blow my didgeridoo!

02:32.040 --> 02:34.008
What's it for, then?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.922
<i>You're invited!
Philip Parker turning 12.</i>

02:52.080 --> 02:53.081
Tomorrow night?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.771
No!

02:55.800 --> 02:57.450
He's the trick to... Good morning!

02:57.520 --> 02:59.329
Oh! There she is!

02:59.400 --> 03:02.290
You are going to be so impressed.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.283
I made what is known as...

03:04.360 --> 03:07.284
the crustless quiche, the frittata.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.765
Wow. What is this?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.446
Two months ago, you couldn't even
grill cheese, and now...

03:11.520 --> 03:13.682
Oh, that looks so good.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.684
- Oh.
- Mmm. Egg and cheese.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.966
Excellent.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.286
Thank you.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.846
So, what are you gentlemen up to today?

03:21.920 --> 03:22.921
Well, let's see.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.167
Em has a dentist appointment
this morning...

03:25.240 --> 03:26.287
Right, right.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.721
And then the two of us
are going to Mommy and Me Yoga.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.211
- Oh, with Summer?
- Yes.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.566
Will you tell her I still exist?

03:31.640 --> 03:34.086
I will. And then when he takes his nap,

03:34.120 --> 03:35.645
I'm gonna send out some resumes.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.801
Good.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.406
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
A thing distinctly hard to say
but harder still to do.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.251
We'll beat a tattoo at a minute or two
and a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tattoo...

03:44.320 --> 03:45.481
and the dragon will come
to the beat of the drum

03:45.520 --> 03:46.646
at a minute or two to two today...

03:46.720 --> 03:47.801
at a minute or two to two.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.649
- I need to pee.
- You have gum in your hair.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.762
A big black bug bit a big black bear...

03:51.800 --> 03:52.961
No!

04:00.560 --> 04:04.007
Anthony! Alexander!
Accelerate. Come on!

04:04.040 --> 04:05.405
One minute!

04:07.000 --> 04:08.889
Hey, if it ain't broke, right?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.441
Guess what?

04:15.520 --> 04:18.250
Philip Parker's having
his birthday party tomorrow night.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.361
That's when
you're having your birthday party.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.368
I know! And I just got the invitation.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.164
He's going all-out, Dad.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.004
He's getting an energy drink bar,

04:25.080 --> 04:27.606
a Korean taco truck, a live band.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.681
That sounds legit.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.802
I think he's having black lights
and a karaoke machine.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.046
Oh, I love karaoke parties.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.089
Look, can I compete with all of that?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.887
Oh, come on,
your birthday's gonna be great.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.282
It's gonna be fun. We're gonna have
pizza. I'm gonna make a cake.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.124
Maybe some volleyball in the pool.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.851
Philip Parker's having a fog machine
and we're having pizza?

04:45.880 --> 04:47.325
- Don't worry.
- You're drinking coffee?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.361
What about my party?

04:48.440 --> 04:49.487
Since when did
you start drinking coffee?

04:49.520 --> 04:50.851
I'm not a morning person.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.929
- Can you check his diaper?
- Oh.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.206
You just dropped Bumble Bee.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.160
- You drop Bumble Bee?
- I think he might be wet.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.168
No. Bumble Bee. There you go.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.280
Wish I could be there, bro,

05:00.360 --> 05:01.566
but I got prom tomorrow night.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.761
I thought that was next week.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.841
It is what it is.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.201
I'll probably be wiped out
from my <i>Peter</i> Pan premiere...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.844
but I'll be happy to sing for you
and all of your friends.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.881
Oh! No, no, no.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.961
<i>Think of</i> a wonderful thought...

05:10.040 --> 05:12.566
Oh, probably Mrs. Gibson. Okay.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.730
Honey, Dad's taking Emily to the dentist.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.330
I've got Anthony. So you're in carpool.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.721
- Take a frittata. It's a crustless quiche.
- There you go.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.171
What did you do to your hair?

05:20.240 --> 05:21.480
Oh, nothing.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.564
Say hi to Mrs. Gibson!
Remember your manners.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.689
Hi, Becky!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.684
Hey, Alexander.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.610
Oh, are you okay?

05:47.360 --> 05:50.204
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.361
Let's go, kids.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.923
<i>And so I cry sometimes
when I'm lying in bed</i>

05:55.040 --> 05:58.601
<i>Just to get it all out, what's in my head</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:03.481
<i>And I, I am feeling a little peculiar...</i>

06:05.080 --> 06:06.889
<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

06:08.960 --> 06:10.450
Pretty scary, right?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.846
<i>Lord of the Flies is beautiful, Alexander.</i>

06:13.920 --> 06:15.445
It's a deep and meaningful allegory

06:15.520 --> 06:17.488
about our own messed-up society.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.601
Yeah, totally.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.404
That's what I meant with "scary."

06:20.480 --> 06:23.131
The society stuff. Crazy.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.803
Hey, check out this app.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.326
He puts your face on
some bikini model's body.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.930
It's really gross and sexist.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.291
This is gonna be hilarious.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.810
- What are you doing?
- Wait, hold on!

06:32.880 --> 06:34.000
- No, no, no.
- I'm not done.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.321
Hey, babe.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.440
Is everything okay?
Your last text was so cold.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.531
No, I said, "See you at school"?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.688
Yeah. I'm your girlfriend, Anthony.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.282
You really should end your texts
with "x-o-x-o" or "I heart you."

06:52.320 --> 06:55.688
You can make a heart
with the less-than sign and a three.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.848
Yeah, I'll try to remember.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.123
So, a bunch of the girls were talking,
and they're all going in limos.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.128
We are getting a limo tomorrow, right?

07:03.160 --> 07:05.640
No, I am taking
my driver's test tomorrow, babe.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.489
The first thing I wanna
do as a licensed driver

07:07.520 --> 07:09.363
is chauffeur you to the prom.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.209
It'll be romantic and stuff.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.161
Oh. Well, I do want it to be romantic.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.440
It Will be.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.207
Oh. Also, I have it
from a very good source who says...

07:19.280 --> 07:20.850
we're being crowned Duke and Duchess

07:20.880 --> 07:22.689
at the Royal Court
tomorrow night at prom.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.200
- That's so tight!
- I know. Isn't it like the best thing ever?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.522
This is
the worst thing ever.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.971
These look so real.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.725
I can't believe
Elliot text-bombed the whole school.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.802
Don't worry about it, man.
Elliot's an idiot.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.405
No one's even gonna look at these.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.120
Hey, Paul.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.406
Philip, my man.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.805
Nice boobs, Alexander.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.649
Since when are you friends
with Philip Parker?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.768
We go to the same
psychopharmacologist.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.844
He's got ADHD, too. He's super nice.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.881
No, he's not.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.169
He's throwing a huge party tomorrow,
and it's not even his actual birthday.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.924
His is next week.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.287
You realize it's just gonna
be you and me at my party.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.681
- Actually, it might just be you.
- What?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.684
You've gotta come.
You're my best friend.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.890
Okay, but personally,
I think you should just postpone.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.605
Philip's popular
and everybody's gonna be there.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.130
Plus, his party sounds pretty dope.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.680
Dude, last year
your dad tap-danced with a cane.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.328
Another bad party could
ruin your rep forever.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.843
Your dad's a nice guy, but trust me...

08:27.920 --> 08:30.127
you do not want
your entire social life in his hands.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.366
Whoo!

08:33.440 --> 08:34.679
Great job!

08:34.760 --> 08:36.524
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

08:36.600 --> 08:39.808
Breathe. You gave birth.
You can do this.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.280
Two. One.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.604
Take your baby back to the womb.
They love it there.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.966
I think that it's so cool when a guy can
step up to be a full-time fommy.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.601
A what?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.121
A father-mommy.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.964
Oh! Okay.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.646
Um, yeah,
I guess I'm sort of a fommy by default.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.443
I was in aerospace,
and I got transitioned out of my job.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.527
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.080
No, that's okay. I get to spend
more time with this little guy.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.641
Excuse me.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.164
Hello?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.850
Yes, this is Ben Cooper.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.404
Tomorrow?

09:18.480 --> 09:19.925
Yes, that's good.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.529
Okay, I'll see you then.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.443
I look forward to it, Greg. Bye-bye.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.080
Good news?

09:26.560 --> 09:28.050
Yeah! I landed an interview.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.485
Hey! That's great.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.166
What do you think of that?
What do you think of that?

09:32.240 --> 09:35.244
Fommy just landed an interview.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.446
Fommy.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.161
Did you hear him say that?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.241
Yes!

09:40.320 --> 09:41.446
He just said Fommy!

09:41.480 --> 09:43.323
- You just said my name!
- Aw!

09:43.400 --> 09:46.051
Guys, he just said Fommy.
Did you hear him say Fommy?

09:46.120 --> 09:47.326
I'm Fommy. Fommy!

09:47.440 --> 09:48.646
That was so cool.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.842
It's so adorable!

09:50.920 --> 09:53.161
I am Fommy, and he said it.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.322
So, with our celebrity readings,

09:55.360 --> 09:57.442
our great grassroots
marketing campaign...

09:57.520 --> 09:58.567
Thank you, Julie...

09:58.640 --> 10:00.404
and the positive reviews
we have coming in...

10:00.480 --> 10:03.882
we are poised for a really strong roll-out.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.440
Tomorrow, we are
going to ask America...

10:06.520 --> 10:08.727
"Who is ready to jump on the potty?"

10:08.800 --> 10:13.124
And I'm confident our sales are going
to leap over expectations.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.804
I know I would have
appreciated this book

10:14.880 --> 10:16.882
when I was potty-training my kids!

10:16.920 --> 10:18.331
That's Alexander, my son.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.806
Thank you, guys!

10:20.880 --> 10:22.962
Thank you for all your support with this.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.889
Oh, man.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.008
I hope that was
thorough enough for you, Nina.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.202
Well, I'm going to need you to make

10:32.280 --> 10:34.521
an incredible effort
on "the Potty" tomorrow.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.005
On "the Potty."

10:36.040 --> 10:38.486
- What?
- You can count on me.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.281
Good. Because if this goes well,
I'm going to make you VP.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.407
Really?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.488
Have you run
Children's Lit and Young Adult.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.210
Oh! Thank you!

10:47.240 --> 10:48.526
Thank you.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.169
I'm going to need you

10:51.240 --> 10:53.641
every second of every minute
of every day.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.927
- Got it.
- 24/7, 365.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.246
That's a lot of numbers.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.321
Is that a joke?

10:58.800 --> 11:02.247
I have four kids that I'll just have
to carve out a little time to see.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.965
Right, right, of course.
Of course you will.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.042
Isn't that one of
your darling little babies right there?

11:07.080 --> 11:08.161
Yeah, it is.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.042
So you're seeing him right now.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.605
All right, country reports.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.042
As you all know,
this is your big project this semester.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.320
- So, what I think...
- Mr. Rogue?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.925
Yeah, Alexander.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.445
I would like to take Australia.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.443
I know a ton about it.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.482
And I have my own didgeridoo.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.804
Yeah, I'm sure there a lot of students
here who want Australia. Am I right?

11:33.840 --> 11:36.081
So to be fair, this semester...

11:37.480 --> 11:40.290
I'm going to let the globe
decide what country.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.441
We'll start with you, Alexander.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.806
You ready? Here we go.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.446
Australia. Australia. Australia.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.931
What will it be?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.209
Ha! Djibouti.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.602
Look at that, the Horn of Africa!
All right, Djibouti!

11:51.640 --> 11:52.846
Dji... what?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.844
Who's gonna be next here?
Philip Parker. Here we go.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.681
Australia.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.808
So, like,
Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.325
That's Austria, not Australia.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.805
- Can we switch?
- No.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.922
Okay, Albert Morio.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.282
Lebanon. That's good.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.806
Partner up,
everybody! Get your aprons on. Guys.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.681
Uh, Becky...

12:19.800 --> 12:21.643
do you want to partner?

12:21.760 --> 12:24.604
Okay. You can take lab notes.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.728
.5 milligrams of boron.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.331
Boron... Boring!

12:35.840 --> 12:38.446
So, Becky, I'm having
a birthday party tomorrow night.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.561
It was only gonna be guys, but I can...

12:41.640 --> 12:45.008
Oh, thanks, but I'm going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.849
I think everyone is.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.526
He has a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.609
So do we!

12:51.680 --> 12:54.331
We have a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.450
- Oh, my God!
- Well, yeah...

12:56.520 --> 12:57.726
My lab book!

12:57.800 --> 12:59.848
Put it out!

13:03.920 --> 13:04.921
Put it out!

13:14.560 --> 13:15.925
Who's responsible for this?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.081
Alexander!

13:24.160 --> 13:25.924
Hey, Alexander! Hold up.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.650
Hey, hold up!

13:27.720 --> 13:29.609
I'm leaving for a conference

13:29.680 --> 13:31.762
and nobody signed up
to take Melvin home.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.683
I can't leave him alone all weekend.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.050
So, what do you want me to do?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.084
Well, you'll make
a furry friend a little less lonely.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.811
Unbelievable.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.327
Cool, we're hosting a guinea pig.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.481
All right!

14:16.400 --> 14:17.401
Sorry we're late.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.442
We had a little
diaper trauma at Trader Joe's.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.601
Hello!

14:21.640 --> 14:23.210
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.282
There's my big boy. Hi!

14:26.240 --> 14:28.163
There you are. Hi, big guy.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.124
- What is that?
- Melvin.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.281
We're hosting
Melvin this weekend.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.361
Oh, boy.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.122
Alexander, would you grab that
and wash it off, please?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.123
He needs Bumble Bee like he needs air.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.201
I know, honey pie.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.567
And after that, the pig goes upstairs.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.801
Shh, it's okay.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.804
Bumble Bee's
just getting a bath. It will be right back.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.207
Alexander, we could use Bumble Bee.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.287
Bumble Bee is coming right back,
right back, right back any second.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.401
Oh! Dad, don't!

15:01.360 --> 15:02.521
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

15:02.600 --> 15:05.524
What was that?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.009
Honey, Bumble Bee's gone.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.243
<i>Peter</i> Pan is going to be awesome.

15:17.320 --> 15:21.689
Today, Mr. Brand said that I am the most
poised and elegant Peter Pan...

15:21.720 --> 15:23.324
he's ever had
the privilege of working with.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.250
No way! Wow.
When is that, again? Just remind me.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.011
- Mom, hello! It's tomorrow afternoon!
- Of course.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.088
Please be on time
and don't be embarrassing.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.247
Best behavior.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.890
Honey, please don't
embarrass our daughter.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.485
- Dad, that includes you.
- I know.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.090
I'll be there, honey, don't worry.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.049
Guess who's getting
crowned Duke at the prom tomorrow.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.690
Really? Congratulations.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.207
Yeah, it's not official,
but Celia heard from a good source.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.406
It's kind of crazy.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.289
I'm dating the hottest girl in school...

15:47.360 --> 15:49.442
I'm getting crowned at prom,
and once I get my license tomorrow...

15:49.520 --> 15:52.364
I kind of have
everything I've ever wanted.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.528
- Hashtag blessed, you know.
- Wait.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.608
Once you get your license tomorrow?

15:56.680 --> 15:58.045
I'm taking my test after school.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.167
Dad already said it was cool.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.326
You said it was cool?

16:00.360 --> 16:03.045
I said it was doable.
Not cool. I said it was doable.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.246
Okay.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.049
It will be fine. We'll make it.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.531
Okay, guys, I have some news.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.243
Nina said that
if the book launch goes well tomorrow...

16:11.280 --> 16:14.045
you could be looking at the new
Vice President of Lone Hill Press.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.161
Honey, wow!

16:15.880 --> 16:16.881
That's big.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.088
Yeah, it would
be a lot more hours at work...

16:19.120 --> 16:22.408
I already feel like I live there some days,
but the raise would be nice.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.761
Awesome. I have some news as well.

16:25.560 --> 16:29.281
I got a call today. I have an interview
for a game design firm.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.646
They're looking for engineers.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.484
- Wait, video games? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.927
Your aerospace engineering dad
might be designing video games.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.764
- That's so cool.
- I know. I know.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.171
Oh!

16:38.240 --> 16:41.403
The best news of all...
Guess who spoke his first word today?

16:43.520 --> 16:44.521
Trevor.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.840
- No!
- Yes.

16:45.920 --> 16:46.921
What did you say?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.405
What was it?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.805
He said fommy.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.291
- He said fommy?
- Yeah.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.243
- What's that?
- Father-mommy.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.484
I didn't know that was a word.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.562
Wow,
we all had pretty big wins today.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.045
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.167
I had a crap day.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.129
What is that smell?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.721
It's Vegemite.
It's from Australia, and back off!

17:04.760 --> 17:05.761
Hey, hey, hey!

17:05.839 --> 17:07.444
Easy. You're gonna have
a good day tomorrow.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.324
It's your birthday. You have friends
coming over, it's gonna be a great party.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.449
Actually, you can forget it,
because I'm canceling my party.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.970
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.246
Nobody's coming.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.961
They're all going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.205
Who is this Philip Parker?

17:20.280 --> 17:23.409
He's a really cool kid
with a hot tub and ADHD.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.488
- I'm gonna call his mom...
- No!

17:25.560 --> 17:28.609
No, no, no.
We're gonna forget about Philip Parker.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.927
Whoever comes to the party comes.
It's gonna be great.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.803
Trust me, nobody is coming.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.521
Elliot Gibson texted pictures of me
in a butt thong to everyone at school.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.365
My best friend
is suddenly best friends with Philip...

17:39.440 --> 17:42.205
because they go to the same
dumb psychopharmacologist.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.089
I didn't get Australia
for my school report...

17:44.160 --> 17:47.562
and I burned down the science lab
with Becky Gibson's lab notes.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.007
- What did you do?
- You burned down the science lab?

17:50.080 --> 17:52.003
Dude, big deal.
So things didn't go your way today.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.491
Go my way?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.045
It was a totally wrecked bad day.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.246
And it's not just today!

17:56.880 --> 17:58.928
It is every single day. Every day!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.970
You don't even care
because your lives are all so perfect!

18:02.000 --> 18:03.365
No, we care. We care, honey.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.249
- What?
- Sweetie.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.440
Where's Bumble Bee?

18:06.520 --> 18:09.729
Alexander murdered it,
so now he's going to cry all night.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.211
- Can't you just get him a new one?
- No.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.203
It's only Bumble Bee.
It's the only one he likes.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.401
It's gotta be Bumble Bee.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.561
I can't deal with this.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.165
I'm going to rehearse in the car.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.725
Maybe this is the time
to wean him from the pacifier.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.006
Honey, easy for you to say.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.530
You're not here with him all day.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.765
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought
Any merry little thought</i>

18:29.840 --> 18:31.569
<i>Think of Christmas, think of snow</i>

18:31.640 --> 18:33.369
<i>Think of sleigh bells, off you go</i>

18:33.440 --> 18:35.488
<i>Like reindeer in the sky</i>

18:35.520 --> 18:39.684
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

18:55.080 --> 18:56.161
Anthony?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.328
I feel like no one understands me.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.531
I do. l get you.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.331
You do?

19:05.960 --> 19:08.611
Yeah. Come on, you're amazing.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.721
Really?

19:11.560 --> 19:12.641
You think I'm amazing?

19:12.720 --> 19:16.042
Honestly, I love you so much.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.769
I love you, too.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.371
I love you more.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.881
No, I love you more.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.651
And don't get me started
on that cute little butt of yours.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.881
What?

19:32.920 --> 19:33.921
What?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.161
Why are you "what" -ing me?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.446
What's your problem?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.208
<i>- Excuse me'?
- You know what? You're so annoying.</i>

19:39.280 --> 19:41.040
Why can't you just chill out?
For one second?

19:41.600 --> 19:42.806
You're exhausting.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.041
Are you kidding?

19:47.600 --> 19:49.602
Sorry, Celia. That was my idiot brother.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.611
Celia?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.931
Seriously?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.090
Now she won't pick up!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.443
I'm worried about Alexander.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.723
I mean, of all the years for
everyone to bail on his birthday.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.641
He's been so moody
since I had Trevor and started work.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.284
Don't worry about it. He's 12.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.685
Everybody's moody at that age.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.966
How's he already 12?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.849
I know. Just happened.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.489
That's the problem.
Everything is just happening so fast.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.521
Yeah.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.647
This house is like a train station.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.245
Everyone's coming and going...

20:28.600 --> 20:30.602
and Trevor's first word was "Fommy."

20:32.040 --> 20:33.724
- Maybe I misheard that.
- I don't think you did.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.801
Honey, come on.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.963
I got the kids covered.
I got the house covered.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.004
You're killing it at work.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.209
Things have never been better.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.601
Oh, please.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.960
- Never been better?
- It's true.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.001
Ben...

20:47.840 --> 20:49.842
you've been unemployed
for the past seven months.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.525
Aren't you stressed out?

20:52.560 --> 20:53.766
Yeah. A little bit.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.204
Why aren't you freaking out more?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.843
What good would freaking out do?

20:58.880 --> 21:01.167
Then I'd just be freaked out
and unemployed.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.850
Tomorrow I'm gonna nail that interview.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.526
Big day tomorrow.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.370
It's 12:01, Melvin.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.806
It's my birthday.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.404
You ever feel alone in the world?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.203
I just wish they understood!

21:35.880 --> 21:37.882
I just wish they knew what it felt like...

21:37.960 --> 21:40.884
to have a terrible, horrible,
no good, very bad day!

22:28.920 --> 22:30.285
Shouldn't you guys be up?

22:30.920 --> 22:32.001
Who hit snooze?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.167
- What time is it?
- Who hit snooze?

22:33.240 --> 22:35.083
- It's morning. It's morning.
- Okay, okay. Go, go, go.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.120
- I have to take a shower.
- All right. Okay, okay.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.764
All right, okay. All right.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.444
Does anyone know
where the diapers are?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.281
I'm in here!

22:51.920 --> 22:52.921
Hey, honey?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.361
Wow! You look terrible. Are you okay?

22:56.440 --> 22:59.171
No, I'm not okay.
Peter Pan can't have a cold, Dad.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.521
Okay.

23:03.960 --> 23:04.961
Oh, come...

23:06.120 --> 23:07.121
Harsh.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.243
Bro, I gotta take a shower. I gotta
get to school. Celia won't call me back.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.008
No! No way, not today!

23:15.120 --> 23:16.326
Get out, dude.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.407
Get out!

23:17.480 --> 23:19.608
Why today?
This is the worst day! No!

23:25.240 --> 23:26.890
I am so late. Emily?

23:26.960 --> 23:28.644
I'm coming in for a razor, honey.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.364
- Mom!
- Mom!

23:30.440 --> 23:31.771
Mom, get out!

23:31.840 --> 23:32.841
I'm sorry!

23:32.880 --> 23:35.884
Sorry. Sorry. I'll wear pants!

23:36.760 --> 23:38.569
Mother!

23:47.080 --> 23:48.684
- Good morning.
- Speak for yourself.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.365
Oh.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.526
- Dad?
- Yeah!

23:51.600 --> 23:54.285
Trevor's peeing! Where's his diaper?

23:54.360 --> 23:55.441
I'm looking!

23:55.880 --> 23:56.881
Oh!

23:59.200 --> 24:00.804
Hey! There's the birthday boy.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.841
Okay, come here.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.169
Okay, you know what?
I want you to have a great day.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.248
You are the captain of your ship.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.322
Steer your ship with positivity.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.601
Oh! Come on!

24:12.720 --> 24:14.529
What is wrong with you people?

24:14.560 --> 24:15.561
Anthony!

24:15.680 --> 24:16.761
Dad, are you okay?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.251
Look, you're older already.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.608
I'm sorry, honey, I have to run.
I have a huge event...

24:21.680 --> 24:23.091
and my foot is killing me.
I'm already late.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.366
Ben, put a diaper on it.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.566
We'll celebrate tonight, okay?

24:25.600 --> 24:26.601
I'm trying.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.928
Emily!

24:46.560 --> 24:48.562
Emily? Emily!

24:50.080 --> 24:51.809
You left the light on in my car all night.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.881
The battery's dead.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.082
I'm the one who had to rehearse
in a cold car, and now I'm sick!

24:56.160 --> 24:57.241
Peter Pan!

24:58.280 --> 25:00.203
- What happened to your head?
- Ben, we gotta go!

25:00.240 --> 25:01.401
It's a zit. Is it that bad?

25:01.440 --> 25:02.566
You should put a Band-Aid on that.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.604
Ben! We have got to go!
You are my ride. Let's go, people.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.251
Alexander, into the car.
We have got to go!

25:08.360 --> 25:10.647
Everybody, out of the house!
Broom it out!

25:12.280 --> 25:14.521
Get out of your comfort zone.
Push it. Push it.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.409
You miss Bumble Bee, don't you?

25:16.440 --> 25:17.601
Why is Anthony driving?

25:17.640 --> 25:18.926
I feel sick enough as it is.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.325
I need practice for my driver's test today.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.562
Okay! Then can we at least
change the music, please?

25:26.680 --> 25:28.364
That's good. Leave that!

25:28.440 --> 25:30.408
You like that? Yeah! That's good.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.885
Wonderful.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.086
I can't believe I'm sick.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.249
I cannot believe that
this guy is 12 years old.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.281
Thanks, Dad.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.243
This is not gonna work for me.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.363
You're gonna have to get around there,
make a left on Brookwood.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.249
- There's no room.
- Get aggressive!

25:44.280 --> 25:46.123
We have places to be.
You're doing great.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.162
Mom, do you mind? Please.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.844
What? Because of this morning?

25:51.160 --> 25:53.128
It's not the first time
I've seen your penis, Anthony!

25:53.160 --> 25:55.128
- Mom saw your penis?
- Yep!

25:55.240 --> 25:56.760
I've seen yours too, Alexander.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.160
I've seen every penis in this car!

25:58.480 --> 25:59.481
Every penis.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.080
Come on!

26:01.320 --> 26:02.651
Excuse me, sir!

26:03.000 --> 26:05.924
Excuse me, sir,
in the ironic Mini Cooper!

26:06.000 --> 26:07.889
You're gonna have
to put down the latte...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.128
and move or I am gonna
come and do it for you!

26:10.160 --> 26:12.447
Sir, I am gonna come... Thank you, son.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.646
Easy, hon.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.284
Nice and slow. Nice and slow, sweets.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.924
Gently, gently.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.001
There you go, honey.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.531
Move, move, move.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.721
Go, go, go.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.131
It's okay, baby.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.764
Mom's gotta go. Have a good day.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.080
Do you have lunch money?

26:36.160 --> 26:37.446
- Yes?
- Got it.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.521
Love you.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.641
Mom!

26:41.240 --> 26:43.129
This is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work!

26:43.200 --> 26:46.044
Let's go! Fold in.
Woodwinds, make a window!

26:46.120 --> 26:48.043
Come on! Let's go, kids!

26:48.080 --> 26:50.162
The bell is ringing! Go, march, march!

26:50.680 --> 26:53.365
Move it on in there. Fold in. Hustle!

26:53.680 --> 26:56.001
Excuse me! Excuse me! Okay, come on!

26:57.000 --> 26:58.729
This day is so cursed.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.721
Everybody move out of the way.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.320
Just move out of the way.
Make a window!

27:06.360 --> 27:07.805
- Go. Here.
- All right.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.769
Goodbye. Take your stuff.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.564
Have a good day, honey!

27:12.640 --> 27:13.641
Here we go, boys.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.931
Celia!

27:20.000 --> 27:21.650
Celia, wait up! What's wrong?

27:21.720 --> 27:23.529
You haven't answered your phone
since last night.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.484
Why do you care?
I thought I was so exhausting.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.846
I wasn't talking to you.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.405
I was talking to my idiot brother.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.960
- Whatever.
- I tried calling you back!

27:31.000 --> 27:33.082
I really didn't feel like talking to you.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.003
I just don't think you understand...

27:35.080 --> 27:37.924
the emotional responsibilities
that come from having a girlfriend.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.445
Wait, are you breaking up with me?

27:42.440 --> 27:43.771
What about tonight?

27:44.240 --> 27:45.446
I don't even wanna go.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.166
Sorry. Morning!

27:52.240 --> 27:53.241
Good morning!

27:54.880 --> 27:56.245
Try calling again!

27:56.280 --> 27:58.169
Sorry I'm late. I had a little car trouble.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.765
My husband had to drop me off.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.923
- What happened?
- This happened!

28:03.440 --> 28:05.647
And not just the cover. No.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.610
15 times throughout the book.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.291
But it must be
some horrible mistake at the printer!

28:11.320 --> 28:14.529
I don't know, Cooper.
You're the one who did the final proof!

28:14.600 --> 28:16.443
We can't have that in a children's book!

28:16.520 --> 28:19.683
We just pulled the plug on publication.
So, that's good.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.849
But we have an even bigger problem.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.127
Celebrity readings. Dick Van Dyke!

28:26.160 --> 28:27.400
I've been calling all morning,
but I can't get through.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.566
Oh no.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.642
I will get down there.
I will fix this. I will take care of this!

28:30.680 --> 28:32.364
He won't read it.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.450
You can count on me!

28:35.880 --> 28:39.362
Oh, Abby, great. I need to borrow
your car. It's a work emergency.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.523
I ride a bike, actually. It's good
exercise and good for the planet.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.125
Just tell me where it is!

28:44.840 --> 28:47.366
Dude, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.646
Have you heard about Philip Parker?

28:48.720 --> 28:50.961
I don't wanna hear anything more
about his amazing party.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.241
No. It's canceled.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.967
What?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.650
Yeah! He woke up with chicken pox.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.085
He texted me this picture.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.003
These things are everywhere.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.086
Oh!

29:01.160 --> 29:02.650
They're even in his butt crack.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.006
So, his party's not on?

29:05.040 --> 29:06.849
No! So everyone's coming
to yours again!

29:06.880 --> 29:08.848
- Really?
- Great, right?

29:08.880 --> 29:10.325
His pox is your gain.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.481
Oh.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.681
I gotta go. I gotta go.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.161
Becky!

29:16.720 --> 29:18.848
Becky, Becky. Wait, wait up.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.361
Hi!

29:21.000 --> 29:23.685
I am really sorry
about burning your binder yesterday.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.927
Today's a new day,
and I thought that we could go ahead...

29:26.000 --> 29:27.729
and sail our ships with positivity!

29:28.520 --> 29:29.681
Wow, okay.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.171
Anyway, Philip Parker has chicken pox.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.486
But my party's still on.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.811
So if you want to swing by,
it's gonna be pretty cool.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.644
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.480
I actually feel bad Philip's gonna miss
such a sweet party, but...

29:44.520 --> 29:46.409
what can you do when you got the pox?

29:47.040 --> 29:49.042
Okay, maybe.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.970
Fantastic! Maybe I'll see you later then.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.042
Okay. See you.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.361
See you!

30:01.720 --> 30:02.960
No.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.291
Should I put more over here?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.204
Hey, birthday boy!

30:13.240 --> 30:14.571
<i>Nothing goofy, Dad.</i>

30:14.600 --> 30:17.080
- What? Alexander?
- Yeah...

30:17.120 --> 30:20.010
and we're gonna need enough food,
cake and drinks for 50 kids.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.367
- Everyone's coming.
- Okay, okay. Hold on. Now hold on.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.731
What are you talking about?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.410
<i>Philip Parker has chicken pox.</i>

30:25.440 --> 30:27.090
<i>- The Party's on!
- Hey!</i>

30:27.120 --> 30:28.804
That's fantastic. I mean, for you.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.850
<i>Yeah. And guess what? Elliot got
busted for text-bombing the school.</i>

30:31.920 --> 30:35.083
So I took your advice
and steered my ship with positivity.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.288
And now Becky Gibson
might be coming, too.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.771
<i>So no magic tricks.</i>

30:38.840 --> 30:40.888
No tap dancing, nothing dorky.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.365
<i>- You got it.
- I'm</i> turning <i>12.</i>

30:42.440 --> 30:44.841
Got it. 12-year-old cool straight up.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.320
- Do it right now.
- It's just allergies.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.441
Really?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.925
Hey, Em. What's up?

30:50.440 --> 30:53.523
They're making me miss dress rehearsal
to lay down in the infirmary.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.443
Oh! And Anthony called me.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.443
Celia broke up with him.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.811
They're going to prom tonight.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.930
Apparently not anymore.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.600
Can I be excused?

31:20.360 --> 31:21.361
Yes.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.966
What?

31:29.040 --> 31:30.485
Listen...

31:30.520 --> 31:32.284
I am sorry about last night.
You have to believe me.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.163
I would never say
those things about you.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.484
And tonight, I'm going
to make it up to you.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.486
X-O-X-O.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.001
I heart you.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.642
Look, I just want
everything to be perfect tonight.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.965
Please...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.331
be my date for the prom.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.646
This isn't <i>Gossip Girl,</i> you two.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.761
Get back inside, Celia.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.686
See you tonight.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.641
Yes!

32:16.800 --> 32:18.325
<i>Let's go, Wreck-It Ralph.</i>

32:18.360 --> 32:20.522
Principal's office now!

32:20.600 --> 32:22.364
Are you sure I can't just
drop him off with you?

32:22.400 --> 32:24.004
Honey,
there's no way. Not today.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.690
<i>What happened to the babysitter?</i>

32:25.720 --> 32:27.404
Oh, she had to cancel again.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.528
You know what? It's okay.
I'll just take him with me.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.085
<i>You're taking Trevor to the interview?</i>

32:31.160 --> 32:32.207
Yeah, I'll be fine.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.004
<i>How's he doing without Bumble Bee?</i>

32:34.040 --> 32:35.883
Um, he is...

32:35.920 --> 32:38.048
He is hanging in there.
He's doing okay.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.248
<i>Okay, honey.
I gotta go. I gotta go. Good luck!</i>

32:40.320 --> 32:41.401
Thanks, you too, hon.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.727
Hey, Anthony, what's up?

32:44.800 --> 32:46.404
<i>Dad, I broke a trophy case
and got suspended.</i>

32:46.480 --> 32:48.403
<i>- What?
- You have to come and pick me up.</i>

32:48.440 --> 32:50.044
No! You gotta be kidding me.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.440
<i>They say you need to come get me.</i>

32:51.480 --> 32:53.289
No, no. You're gonna
have to wait at the Principal's

32:53.360 --> 32:54.725
office till I'm done with my interview.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.841
<i>Fine, I'll be here.</i>

32:55.880 --> 32:57.211
Okay, bye.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.807
On your left! I'm on your right!

33:16.280 --> 33:17.964
On your right. On your left.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.687
Are you okay?

33:20.760 --> 33:21.761
I'm good. I got it!

33:22.120 --> 33:23.610
I'm good. Don't worry!

33:29.800 --> 33:30.881
Excuse me.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.809
Mr. Van Dyke. Mr. Van Dyke!

33:32.880 --> 33:35.280
I have been trying to reach you
because I'm here to save you.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.249
I'm from the publishing company.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.442
Let me start again. I'm not crazy.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.567
Please welcome
legendary performer...

33:40.600 --> 33:41.886
- No, no.
- That's my cue.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.763
We'll have a little chat later, all right?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.723
This is not something we should
leave until afterwards.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.205
We wanna have
a chat right now, Mr. Van Dyke!

33:47.280 --> 33:49.567
Please welcome Mr. Dick Van Dyke!

33:51.600 --> 33:52.806
Please!

33:56.840 --> 33:58.171
I insist that you get him.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.924
And I insist you stay right there.

33:59.960 --> 34:00.961
- Hi, kids!
- Sir!

34:01.040 --> 34:02.280
And hi, moms and dads.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.328
There was a misprint! Just two minutes!

34:04.400 --> 34:06.482
If you guys don't know who I am,
ask your parents.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.521
And if they don't know...

34:07.600 --> 34:08.840
have them ask their parents.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.811
We're gonna have a great time today.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.882
- I'm gonna read to you.
- You're not gonna want to say-!

34:14.960 --> 34:17.201
I'm gonna read from a very special book.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.281
You ready?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.049
Get out of my way. I need him. Sir!

34:20.159 --> 34:23.527
"Today's the day. You're growing up!

34:23.600 --> 34:24.965
"I'm here to help you...

34:25.080 --> 34:26.411
take that dump!"

34:26.480 --> 34:28.005
Please don't, sir!

34:28.040 --> 34:29.804
"Take that dump in the pool!

34:31.000 --> 34:32.764
"Take that dump on the bed!

34:33.440 --> 34:37.445
"But, don't take a dump on your,
on your brother's head.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.322
"You can take a dump like a frog.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.487
"I'll take a big dump like a dog!"

34:43.159 --> 34:44.685
No! It's "jump"!

34:44.719 --> 34:47.041
It's just jump, sir. Not dump.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.801
Would you excuse me for a moment?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.001
I never agreed to do this kind of...

34:50.080 --> 34:51.320
There was a misprint.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.250
Jump like a frog. One little letter.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.328
It was a mistake!
It was meant to be jump! I'm so sorry.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.011
There she is, right there,
with the bad hair! She's behind this.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.326
Okay, we got this. We got this, right?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.681
You good? You cool? You ready?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.047
You ready to nail this? All right.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.403
Oh, wow!

35:34.400 --> 35:35.731
Hey, man, guys are ready for you.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.962
- Let's go.
- Oh, great, thank you.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.086
At first we thought it was a little weird

35:41.200 --> 35:42.247
that you even applied for this job...

35:42.320 --> 35:45.767
because we're pretty young and you're...

35:46.240 --> 35:47.241
Older.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.481
Kind of decrepit.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.480
But then we took a look at your resume,

35:51.520 --> 35:52.931
and your experience is awesome.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.722
You're part of
the space station design team.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.889
You have a Ph.D.
in orbital mechanics. I mean, for real?

35:58.920 --> 35:59.921
For real.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.361
Sorry.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.371
Hey, you.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.208
He's a little out of sorts today.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.082
It's so hard
to find the Bumble Bee pacifier.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.203
It would blow your mind. Anyway...

36:16.240 --> 36:17.765
Here you go.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.689
He's just gonna play for a while.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.127
And, kids are crazy.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.761
They're fun.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.841
Yeah.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.649
So, what were we talking about?

36:26.720 --> 36:28.290
We're thinking about
launching this game.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.608
We want it to be a space station
simulation strategy game.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.644
We want it to be authentic
and completely immersive.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.563
That sounds really exciting.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.090
That's in my wheelhouse.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.690
Great! We wanna hear some ideas.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.848
I guess my first idea would
be modular evolution.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.251
Cool.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.567
Space stations are not static.
They grow over time.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.008
So you would want to start with
perhaps a small space station...

36:49.080 --> 36:51.447
and grow it into
an enormous space station.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.761
And I think players
should have that opportunity.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.689
They could add greenhouses.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.171
They could add labs.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.765
They could grow a space station...

36:59.600 --> 37:01.329
as big as their imagination.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.961
- Uh... Your kid.
- Oh!

37:04.040 --> 37:05.644
You know what, that'll be fine.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.967
Because we can get daycare,
so that won't be an issue.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.485
No, no, no.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.521
Your kid right now...

37:11.680 --> 37:13.523
his face is all green.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.682
Oh! Wow, Trev.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.011
Trevor. I know.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.721
That's not for eating.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.171
Yoshi, what's up, man?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.089
<i>Good news to report or what?</i>

37:25.160 --> 37:27.925
Actually, we have
a Skype call we gotta take.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.365
But we will call you back.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.571
Okay. You'll call me back?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.161
- Yeah.
- All right.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.683
Great. All right, we'll head out.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.886
You ready to go?

37:41.200 --> 37:42.281
Anthony,

37:42.360 --> 37:45.682
of all the days for you to get sent home,
it had to be today?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.046
Dad, it was a freak accident!

37:47.120 --> 37:48.360
Don't!

37:50.440 --> 37:51.566
What happened to Trevor?

37:54.200 --> 37:55.361
That's real mature, Dad.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.441
Hey, Salamander.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.686
Hey, Dad!

38:07.080 --> 38:09.048
Whoa! What happened to Trevor?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.521
He ate a delicious
green marker for lunch.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.568
- Why are you here?
- Shut up.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.688
Em, I thought you had to stay
to get ready for your play.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.721
I need drugs.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.326
Real drugs. The nurse will
only give me baby aspirin.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.731
What happened to Trevor?

38:20.760 --> 38:23.445
Emily, we're not gonna pump you
full of medicine. You're not a cyclist.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.444
I'm not asking for steroids.
I need cough syrup, something.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.409
Wait, Dad! How was your interview?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.240
It was not a good fit.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.450
But, you know? We'll see what happens.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.641
It was fine.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.721
Try again next time.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.801
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Brand.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.167
I know she's not 100%, but...

38:38.240 --> 38:40.402
as they say, the show must go on.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.482
So, if you could get her back here
by 3:00 for hair and makeup...

38:42.560 --> 38:43.561
that would be tremendous.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.081
Em, you look terrible.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.525
Maybe you should have
your understudy do it?

38:47.560 --> 38:51.007
No! Nobody wears
those tights but me. Pharmacy, pronto!

38:52.120 --> 38:53.610
Nobody wears the tights but her.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.611
<i>Any available cashier to register two.</i>

39:02.680 --> 39:04.250
Extra strength or regular?

39:04.320 --> 39:05.924
What do you think?

39:05.960 --> 39:07.610
Excuse me. Do you have
a Bumble Bee pacifier?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.005
Does it have to be Bumble Bee?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.081
It has to be the Bumble Bee.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.531
Yes, because this ain't gonna last.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.840
Thank you.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.206
Hey, how'd the reading go?

39:14.280 --> 39:15.840
<i>It could've gone better.</i>

39:16.280 --> 39:17.770
<i>Honey, I'm sure it was great.</i>

39:17.840 --> 39:18.921
Uh, well...

39:19.520 --> 39:23.241
<i>Well, you know what,
I'm sure it was not that bad, really.</i>

39:23.960 --> 39:27.248
That girl with the awful hair, I think.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.921
No, no. I thought, maybe... No, it's bad.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.291
<i>It was bad. It was lose-my-job bad.</i>

39:32.320 --> 39:33.685
Really?

39:33.760 --> 39:36.650
Anthony, come on! No, please. Stop it.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.125
- No, I'm just...
- Stop it!

39:38.160 --> 39:39.810
What are you doing?
Why is Anthony with you?

39:39.880 --> 39:41.325
He was suspended from school...

39:41.440 --> 39:42.885
<i>for destroying school property.</i>

39:43.280 --> 39:45.123
- What? What happened?
- It's fine.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.525
It was an accident.
I'll tell you about it later.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.080
Okay, so, Em is getting her cough syrup.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.770
I'm taking Anthony to his driver's test.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.484
And, good news!

39:52.520 --> 39:54.807
50 kids are coming over tonight.
The party is on!

39:54.840 --> 39:55.841
<i>Boy, this is...</i>

39:55.960 --> 39:58.645
- Maybe I should meet you. I'm not far.
<i>- It's</i> fine!

39:58.680 --> 40:01.445
Hon, I'm totally... Hold on.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.323
No, we don't have one.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.203
Daddy wishes he could swear right now.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.047
Hey, question.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.049
Permanent marker,
do you know if it's poisonous?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.560
Because he might have ingested some.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.841
What?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.450
<i>- Ben!</i>
- Honey, honey...

40:13.480 --> 40:14.686
- I'm coming!
- No, no, no! I'm good.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.125
Tell Trevor Mama's on her way!

40:21.600 --> 40:23.045
Nobody's home.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.246
Call 'em, dude.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.688
Anthony, are you sure
you're up for this today?

40:32.760 --> 40:34.967
Dad, it's now or never.
I promised Celia.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.368
All right. Well, anything worth
doing is worth doing well.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.320
Try not to kill anybody.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.165
Hello. Yeah.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.364
I'm not gonna be back
for a while, so, the gate's open.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.050
Just go in, start setting everything up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.366
<i>Are you sure you guys can handle this?</i>

40:51.440 --> 40:53.204
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
We'll be ready to party.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.241
<i>Okay-</i>

40:54.320 --> 40:55.560
- Okay, great.
- See you later.

40:55.680 --> 40:56.681
Thanks.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.567
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.568
Emily, just the recommended
dosage, please.

41:01.640 --> 41:02.720
That stuff's pretty strong.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.561
Hi, guys.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.880
Hey, there's Mama.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.046
Why is my baby green?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.411
Well, things went a little awry today.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.441
Honey.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.521
- Look who it is.
- Ben, he's green.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.561
- I know.
- What is this?

41:11.640 --> 41:14.723
It's marker. It's fine.
How did it go? How was the reading?

41:14.760 --> 41:17.570
It was awful. I think I pretty much
flushed my career down the potty.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.721
Why, what happened?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.444
Never mind. Can I have the wipes?

41:22.520 --> 41:24.249
- Dad!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.243
I told you this day was cursed.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.281
Sorry.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.601
Cooper. Anthony Cooper.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.727
- All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck, baby.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.922
<i>- Here you go.
- Anthony Cooper.</i>

41:33.120 --> 41:34.121
Wait, Anthony!

41:34.960 --> 41:36.564
Please don't do it today.
You're gonna fail.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.726
Alexander...

41:37.760 --> 41:39.091
give your brother some space, please.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.407
Yeah, the next time you see this face,
it's gonna be on my driver's license.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.521
It's not coming off.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.931
Just hurry up! I need to get to my play.

41:43.960 --> 41:44.961
What kind of a person...

41:45.040 --> 41:46.087
It's not poisonous.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.890
I don't think it's poisonous.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.446
Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm really excited...

41:59.480 --> 42:01.130
There are only two things
you need to know.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.130
My name is Ms. Suggs
and I'll be your driving examiner.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.050
Now, you may be
the big man on campus out there...

42:07.120 --> 42:09.441
but in this minivan, I'm the B.M.O.C.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.965
You get me?

42:11.000 --> 42:14.925
Now put your hands at 10 and 2,
and show me what you can do.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.528
Hi, Mom, how you doing?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.123
How's your day going so far?

42:21.160 --> 42:23.128
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- What?

42:23.160 --> 42:25.288
Just make this little call.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.401
Okay.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.085
Yeah, it's...

42:33.520 --> 42:35.602
Cooper! Where are you?

42:35.640 --> 42:37.802
<i>My family had a little situation, so...</i>

42:37.840 --> 42:39.649
Really? That's funny.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.650
Because we're having
a little bit of a situation here!

42:42.720 --> 42:45.326
<i>The phones are going crazy.</i>

42:45.400 --> 42:47.004
What happened at that reading?

42:47.360 --> 42:49.010
Well, it was a really good crowd.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.764
It was a big, big crowd. Big turnout.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.850
And the parents seemed
to have a lot to say.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.161
- They responded.
<i>- Did they?</i>

42:57.200 --> 43:00.886
Did they respond
to Dick Van Dyke asking their toddlers...

43:00.960 --> 43:02.928
if they could take a dump like a dog?

43:03.520 --> 43:05.488
<i>I thought I could count on you.</i>

43:05.600 --> 43:07.204
We'll discuss this later.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.048
I look forward to...
I look forward to that.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.005
Tell me something, Anthony.
Are you a senior citizen?

43:21.680 --> 43:23.011
No, ma'am.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.681
Well, then why are you driving
15 miles an hour in a 25 mile zone?

43:25.760 --> 43:26.761
Come on, speed it up.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.761
That's right. That is right. Boy.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.562
Change lanes.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.120
Now, I want you to take a right up here.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.362
All right. Okay.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.725
Celia's calling.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.246
It's my girlfriend.
Probably wants to talk prom plans.

44:03.320 --> 44:07.086
Tonight's the prom.
Well, I'll just ignore that.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.610
It seems like
she's very anxious to talk to you.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.090
No. No, no. I'm driving.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.242
I would never answer
the phone when I'm driving.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.481
No.

44:16.560 --> 44:17.680
No matter what circumstance.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.166
But, you know,
proms don't happen every day.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.287
That's true.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.568
You sure?
It'll just be super quick. It's not...

44:24.640 --> 44:27.883
What's important to you
is important to me.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.401
Right?

44:32.080 --> 44:34.128
Hey, Celia.
I can't really talk right now, but...

44:34.200 --> 44:37.090
- Put the phone down!
- What?

44:37.120 --> 44:39.521
Put the mobile device down now!

44:39.600 --> 44:40.681
Hey, eyes on the road!

44:41.760 --> 44:43.091
No, no!

44:46.120 --> 44:47.451
You're gonna kill us!

44:54.600 --> 44:55.647
What is wrong with you?

44:57.840 --> 44:59.046
What are you doing?

44:59.120 --> 45:03.250
What are you...
What are you doing? You fool!

45:07.760 --> 45:09.125
You tricked me!

45:09.480 --> 45:10.606
Get outta this car.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.806
- You get out of this car.
- You're evil!

45:12.960 --> 45:14.291
You prom creep!

45:14.480 --> 45:16.482
- I don't think he passed.
- Get out!

45:16.520 --> 45:17.521
Get out!

45:38.160 --> 45:39.286
This is your fault.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.444
If you hadn't caused a fight
between me and Celia...

45:41.480 --> 45:42.481
I would've never picked up that call...

45:42.560 --> 45:43.641
- and failed my test.
- No, no, no.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.001
Anthony, you are
not passing the blame on this one.

45:46.040 --> 45:48.486
I told you today might not be a good day
to take the test.

45:48.520 --> 45:49.851
Dad, I had to take the test today.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.006
No, you didn't have
to take the test today.

45:51.080 --> 45:52.570
It is all Alexander's fault.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.688
If he hadn't dropped Trevor's
paci down the disposal...

45:54.720 --> 45:57.371
I never would have
rehearsed in a cold car and gotten sick.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.481
That's also your fault.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.409
If you hadn't
left the battery on in my car all night...

46:00.480 --> 46:01.481
I wouldn't have been late to work...

46:01.520 --> 46:03.170
and Dick Van Dyke
wouldn't be mad at me.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.646
Chim Chiminey wants to kill me!
Can you imagine?

46:05.680 --> 46:08.604
Mom, Trevor was crying!
Where was I supposed to rehearse?

46:08.680 --> 46:12.002
How were you able
to hit every parking meter on that street?

46:12.120 --> 46:13.724
When I was in the bathroom
this morning, Mom saw me naked!

46:13.800 --> 46:15.723
I don't think you left a speck of paint!

46:15.800 --> 46:18.121
Her fault!
She's an evil woman.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.771
Boom, boom, boom,
one right after the other.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.211
Stop, you guys!

46:23.040 --> 46:24.451
Okay, stop!

46:25.840 --> 46:27.524
It was my fault.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.803
I'm to blame for all of it. For everything.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.291
Yeah, see? I told you.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.964
No, hold on, hold on.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.281
Alexander, what are you saying?

46:36.360 --> 46:37.361
Okay, look.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.846
Last night I made
myself a birthday sundae

46:39.880 --> 46:41.450
and I made a wish on a candle...

46:41.520 --> 46:44.808
and I think I cursed this day
for all of you.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.530
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.846
I just wanted you guys
to know what it was like...

46:47.880 --> 46:50.724
to have a massively
horrible, terrible day.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.569
So I wished it...

46:52.640 --> 46:54.244
and now you're all having one.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.361
Alexander,
as incredible as it would be...

46:56.400 --> 46:58.482
for you to have
that kind of supernatural ability...

46:58.560 --> 46:59.766
I don't think you can
actually curse a day, buddy.

46:59.840 --> 47:02.047
Yeah, sweetie,
this isn't your fault.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.366
We just bit off
more than we could chew today...

47:03.400 --> 47:04.561
and it isn't going our way.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.364
No, look, I did curse the day.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.880
I don't know how,
but I did, and it worked.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.570
And now Emily's gonna miss her play...

47:10.600 --> 47:13.251
and Anthony's not gonna be
able to drive Celia to the prom.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.566
He's been waiting all year to make out
with her in the back of the van.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.364
Okay, we don't need to hear that.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.004
Okay, I'm sorry.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.404
I'm really sorry.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.761
Just forget my party.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.723
It'll be a disaster anyway.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.130
Apology not accepted.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.441
Look...

47:35.240 --> 47:39.450
this day is not ruined,
because this day is not over yet.

47:39.480 --> 47:40.845
Dad, you're so right.

47:40.960 --> 47:44.123
I may be sick, but there's no way
I'm missing opening night.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.446
I may have wrecked the van...

47:45.480 --> 47:48.324
but I'm not missing prom
with Celia. I can't.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.325
Look, we are not
going to let this day get the better of us.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.283
It's like last week at Target
when Dad lost Trevor for 45 minutes.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.446
- Okay.
- Yeah.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.244
And the store manager
wanted to call the cops...

47:59.280 --> 48:01.282
but Dad said, "No!"

48:01.320 --> 48:02.970
- We found him.
- "We are gonna keep looking."

48:03.040 --> 48:04.041
We will keep looking for my baby?

48:04.120 --> 48:05.281
"We will find my baby."

48:05.360 --> 48:06.646
They sealed the doors. It was fine.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.648
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

48:08.680 --> 48:09.806
Okay, guys, okay.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.803
It's past 3:00, so if we're gonna go,
we gotta do this now.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.001
Are we ready, Coopers?

48:13.080 --> 48:15.321
All right! Clap those hands
if you believe in fairies!

48:15.400 --> 48:16.970
Emily, are you okay?

48:17.080 --> 48:20.289
Mom! Positivism. Let's do this thing.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.765
Get in there, get in there.

48:21.800 --> 48:23.689
- Buckle, buckle!
- Buckle, buckle!

48:25.320 --> 48:26.651
Go, go, go, go, go!

48:27.720 --> 48:30.291
It seems we may
have accidentally given your tux away.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.401
Well, get it back.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.482
Sir, I cannot un-tux a client.

48:33.520 --> 48:35.682
My sister's Peter Pan
and we've got 10 minutes till curtain.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.484
You better un-tux something.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.206
There is one option.
You might be able to pull it off.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.880
All right, fire up. Come on, let's go.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.206
Coopers on the move!

49:01.360 --> 49:02.361
We got it.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.244
All right. Anthony, find a seat.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.521
Break a leg, Em.

49:06.680 --> 49:07.727
I'm here!

49:07.920 --> 49:08.921
Get some more of this.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.001
Honey? Hon, hon.

49:10.880 --> 49:14.282
Em. Em. Sweetie,
I think you've had plenty of that.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.680
It's okay, honey.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.529
- Peter Pan is here, everybody!
- Excuse me, people.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.881
- Everybody, Peter's here!
- Excuse us, excuse us.

49:20.960 --> 49:21.961
- You look so pretty.
- Superstar coming through.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.041
Superstar

49:23.080 --> 49:24.570
Excuse me, everyone.

49:24.600 --> 49:25.601
All right.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.210
I love your outfit.

49:30.800 --> 49:31.801
Okay.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.051
I said 3:00.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.560
You have no idea
the kind of day we are having.

49:37.640 --> 49:38.680
It's a miracle we're here.

49:38.720 --> 49:40.840
Well, you're late,
which is not professional behavior.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.564
No! And it's not professional...

49:42.600 --> 49:44.568
because this is an eighth grade
production of <i>Peter</i> Pan.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.450
And if you could take
one look at our minivan...

49:47.520 --> 49:49.284
Mr. Brand, I am not somebody

49:49.360 --> 49:51.328
that you wanna mess with right now.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.965
So grab her some green tights
and a harness...

49:54.040 --> 49:55.280
and fire up her Tinker Bell!

49:55.360 --> 49:57.169
As soon as you
have your costumes on...

49:57.240 --> 49:58.446
go for your hair.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.726
Way to go, Daddy-O!

49:59.760 --> 50:01.285
- Break a leg, sweetie.
- Good luck!

50:01.360 --> 50:03.880
Show's about to start, Emily.
We've got to get you going.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.924
Everything's under control.
Yeah. You okay?

50:15.000 --> 50:16.286
Yeah.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.329
- I'm excited about this.
- Yeah.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.447
It's gonna be great.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.521
Yeah, I think so.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.967
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Father.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.044
Now, you two be quiet
and I'll tell you a story.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.804
What sort of story?

50:37.840 --> 50:39.205
The best sort.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.727
One filled with
magic and fairies and savage pirates...

50:42.800 --> 50:44.131
called Never Never Land.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.605
Hi, hello!

50:46.840 --> 50:48.126
Whoa! No!

50:48.520 --> 50:50.682
I'm a little boy
named Peter Pan!

50:51.840 --> 50:53.490
- Hello! How are you?
- What's wrong with her?

50:53.560 --> 50:54.641
It must be the cough syrup.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.324
So good to see you.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.648
Peter Pan is in the house!

51:01.400 --> 51:02.640
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought</i>

51:02.720 --> 51:03.960
Get the hook and get her down!

51:04.080 --> 51:05.320
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

51:05.360 --> 51:07.442
- Oh, no!
- Hook her down! Hook her!

51:07.480 --> 51:08.641
I'm floating. I'm floating.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.681
Get her!

51:12.360 --> 51:14.647
<i>Reindeer in the sky</i>

51:15.160 --> 51:16.844
<i>Let go!</i>

51:17.040 --> 51:18.724
- Get her down!
- Let go of me!

51:19.240 --> 51:20.480
Let go of me right now!

51:21.240 --> 51:22.241
<i>Let go!</i>

51:23.360 --> 51:25.681
<i>Everybody, fly!</i>

51:33.520 --> 51:35.200
She's okay. She's all right. There she is.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.280
Ta-da!

51:37.840 --> 51:40.127
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.680
Oh, my God, Josephine, hi!

51:42.720 --> 51:44.290
Daniel, hi!

51:44.360 --> 51:47.842
Hi! Hello, everybody.
Take some pixie dust!

51:48.520 --> 51:51.205
Thank you, thank you!

51:53.960 --> 51:56.042
How much cough syrup did she have?

51:56.080 --> 51:58.048
Clearly, way too much.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.366
There she is.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.210
- Hi!
- Hey, honey.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.761
Wow.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.410
Well, that was
an incredible thing to watch.

52:12.440 --> 52:15.205
I think I broke Captain Hook's nose.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.487
Sweetie, it's not your fault.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.291
We shouldn't have let
you go out there today.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.567
No, you can't fool around
with medicine, hon.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.721
Emily. Emily.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.762
Dude, you crushed it!

52:25.840 --> 52:27.808
I gotta change into my tux.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.648
- Mr. Brand?
- Not now.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.760
Can't speak.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.246
Honey, it's all going
to be okay. Trust me.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.761
Love you, Dad.

52:42.520 --> 52:43.760
Love you, too.

52:48.440 --> 52:53.128
Okay, sweetie.
Okay, honey. That felt good.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.246
You get that out.

52:55.320 --> 52:56.446
Let's go outside and get you some air.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.845
I'm sorry.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.570
No, honey, it's fine.

52:59.600 --> 53:01.090
- Okay.
- It's fine.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.842
- When did she start eating carrots?
- Uh...

53:08.440 --> 53:12.047
Your sister has excellent aim.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.161
Can I have another towel?

53:14.600 --> 53:16.170
Thanks. Oh, man.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.280
Hello?

53:22.200 --> 53:23.486
Hey, Greg.

53:24.960 --> 53:26.644
No, now's a fine time.

53:27.640 --> 53:28.880
You did?

53:29.720 --> 53:32.644
No, I'm not surprised.
I thought it was a killer interview also.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.041
Uh-huh.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.284
You wanna meet? Okay.

53:39.360 --> 53:41.328
Well, now actually
isn't a really good time.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.283
No. No, no, no.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.731
- Go, go, go!
- Drinks at Nagamaki?

53:44.800 --> 53:46.404
- Go!
- Could you hold on a second, Greg?

53:46.480 --> 53:48.482
Alexander, I appreciate
what you're trying to do...

53:48.520 --> 53:50.124
but our plate is full.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.288
We got too much
going on tonight, kiddo.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.482
Dad, curse or no curse...

53:54.520 --> 53:56.045
just go for it!

54:00.840 --> 54:02.001
Greg, we're gonna go for it.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.486
Yeah, I will see you
at Nagamaki later, okay?

54:04.560 --> 54:09.088
Okay. Good. I look forward to it.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.161
Awesome!

54:10.200 --> 54:12.680
Okay. I reek.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.803
You do. Oh, look. Wait.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.251
This looks like your size.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.482
I'm not going to wear a pirate blouse.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.285
Pirate or puke, your choice.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.690
It's okay, Em.

54:32.560 --> 54:36.360
It took a lot of courage
to fly out on that stage tonight.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.691
Do you have any idea
how proud we are of you?

54:41.880 --> 54:45.202
You've always just
put yourself out there.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.124
You are fearless.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.962
You're willing
to show the world who you really are.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.883
That's amazing.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.328
But if you're ever
about to take the stage on Broadway...

54:56.360 --> 54:59.489
and you decide to drink
a bottle of cough syrup, give me a call.

54:59.560 --> 55:00.891
Let me talk you out of it.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.409
Ladies, care to do some pillaging?

55:09.040 --> 55:10.804
Okay. All right.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.364
All right, how did I end up blue?

55:39.400 --> 55:40.686
Celia's gonna love it.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.205
It's totally retro.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.241
Just own it, kiddo.

55:43.360 --> 55:46.125
You look ridiculous.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.923
Go get your Duchess, Duke.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.610
My little boy...

55:57.600 --> 55:59.329
in a tuxedo, going to prom...

56:00.440 --> 56:02.124
in sneakers.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.007
Wow. You look amazing.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.649
What are you wearing?
You look like Willy Wonka.

56:19.520 --> 56:20.931
I'm trying something different.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.331
What's going on?

56:28.680 --> 56:30.284
Oh...

56:30.320 --> 56:32.527
Yeah, I kind of failed my driver's test.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.321
Oops.

56:52.440 --> 56:53.851
You look beautiful, Celia.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.965
'Course I do.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.206
Yeah, that's a sick dress.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.521
I hope this isn't
too much wind for you, Celia.

57:00.560 --> 57:02.881
It's actually helping
with the vomit smell.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.490
So is everybody hungry?

57:10.520 --> 57:12.329
- I am.
- I am.

57:12.360 --> 57:13.441
They're coming to dinner?

57:13.520 --> 57:15.522
Don't worry.
They're not gonna sit at our table.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.645
- How about some music?
- Yes. Yes.

57:20.240 --> 57:21.241
Oh.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.327
No surprise, the radio's broken.

57:57.560 --> 58:00.404
This is just something
that we do for fun sometimes.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.724
Figured it'd make you laugh.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.890
We're going to Nagamaki!

58:12.920 --> 58:14.684
What? Are you kidding me?

58:14.760 --> 58:16.762
- Nagamaki!
- They cook it on the table.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.370
They cook it right on the table.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.925
Like a fondue, but not.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.041
Supposed to be
a very authentic Japanese restaurant.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.366
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

58:36.440 --> 58:37.601
Thank you.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.287
Konnichiwa. Welcome to Nagamaki!

58:41.360 --> 58:42.441
Table for two, please.

58:42.520 --> 58:43.601
Right this way.

58:45.560 --> 58:46.561
There they are.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.001
You okay?

58:49.280 --> 58:50.281
Yeah.

58:51.600 --> 58:54.365
Honey, come on.
Ben, you're the smartest guy I know.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.966
You're literally a rocket scientist.
You've got these guys.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.930
Is it better tucked in?

59:01.800 --> 59:03.564
You hesitated. Here we go.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.130
- Go get them, buccaneer.
- Thanks. Bye.

59:05.160 --> 59:07.527
- Good luck.
- Good luck, good luck.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.641
Hey, fellas.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.329
Is that a pirate's blouse?

59:18.440 --> 59:19.441
Yaar!

59:23.320 --> 59:24.890
Yes, it be!

59:24.960 --> 59:26.121
Yaar-some!

59:26.520 --> 59:28.329
Climb aboard, matey!

59:29.160 --> 59:30.241
How's he doing?

59:30.320 --> 59:31.685
He looks like he's having fun.

59:31.760 --> 59:32.761
He does?

59:32.800 --> 59:34.086
They look impressed.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.321
Oh, good.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.643
That is exactly what I am talking about.
You have multi-players...

59:38.760 --> 59:40.285
<i>Survivor-style.</i>

59:40.320 --> 59:41.810
It's Survivor on a space station.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.080
That's so cool. Multi-player.
What do you think?

59:43.160 --> 59:44.650
- Yoshi's gonna flip.
- It would be sick.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.841
To Ben.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.566
The space pirates.

59:47.640 --> 59:48.880
- Space pirates.
- Space pirate.

59:56.320 --> 59:58.368
Are you sure you're not adopted?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.842
You should try a shrimp.
They're really good.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.041
I'm allergic to shrimp.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.002
You should know
what your girlfriend's allergic to.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.326
Yeah, sorry.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.886
X-O-X-O?

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.528
Anthony, I just can't believe, on the most
important night of our lives...

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.881
you brought me to a place
where I have to watch my food...

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.450
get cooked in front of me.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.170
Who goes to Nagamaki
before the prom?

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.570
It's so amazing, okay?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.047
Look! It's Hope and Dale
and Heather and Dave!

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.088
Hey, guys-.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.924
Hey, Celia. What's up, Anthony?

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.050
O-M-G! You look beautiful.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.610
- Love it.
- Thanks.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.409
Don't you guys just love this place?

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.766
Totally. I die for it.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.044
Oh, my God, me too.
I'll catch you guys later?

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.201
Okay.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.601
Space pirate!
Space pirate! Space pirate!

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.369
Sake bomb!

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.604
It sounds like it couldn't be going better.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.367
Chef Ananda! Shrimp me.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.561
Oh!

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.361
You ready?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.606
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.006
One! That was one.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.761
Yeah!

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.841
Fire it up!

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.561
Three!

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.081
Four!

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.161
Keep it going.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.761
Five!

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.561
Six!

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.801
Seven!

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.761
Eight!

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.086
Nine!

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.121
Ten!

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.366
Mom, Dad's on fire!

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.441
<i>I</i> hope so!

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.084
No, no, no. He's really on fire!

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.890
Drop and roll, Ben. Drop and roll.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.161
Drop and roll!

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.001
Stop, drop and roll, honey.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.081
Dad?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.645
I still have me arms!

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.731
Thank you for your time.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.648
Nice job, you really nailed it.
Really nailed it, Ben!

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.241
You know who you are?
You're the flaming pirate of Nagamaki!

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.650
- Thank you!
- Whoa!

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.724
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.441
Are you okay?

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.445
Yeah! I'm good.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.690
I'm fine.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.281
It's all good.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.241
It's all good.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.201
Dad...

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.722
you don't always
have to steer your ship with positivity!

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.161
You keep us up
and we really appreciate it.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.487
But some days are just bad.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.925
Nothing can fix it.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.041
Trust me.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.847
I would know.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.490
At least we're all together now.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.484
It's my job to take care of you guys.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.924
And, make sure
you don't have bad days.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.131
- And when you do, it's on me!
- Ben.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.801
I think that you just...

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.569
got to have the bad days so you can
love the good days even more.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.408
This day has been terrible!

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.761
Terrible day.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.250
Yeah! A horrible day!

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.806
A no-good...

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.526
Very bad day!

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.885
You know what I think?

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.405
I think this day sucks!

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.487
Yes! It does.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.561
Thank you!

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.090
I love you guys.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.121
Come here.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.886
Ow!

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.326
Can't breathe!

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.364
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally. Come with us.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.569
Okay, cool. All right, so, good news.
They have room...

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.080
and they said we could go with them.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.926
Uh...

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.041
I don't know.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.640
What do you mean, you don't know?

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.369
We're not going in some busted-up
minivan with your crazy family.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.240
You know what, go without me.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.561
Excuse me?

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.207
You want me to go
to the prom without you?

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.688
Yes. That's what I want.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.845
I'm sticking with my family tonight.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.807
You're choosing them over me?

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.043
Yes, Celia. I am.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.326
Because they're my family.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.641
And if they're crazy,
then I guess it makes me crazy, too.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.530
Have fun at the prom, Duchess.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.491
What are you doing?

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.570
Forget it.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.051
So, what? No prom?

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.121
It's junior prom. The real one's next year.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.130
What about Celia?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.651
I realized there's
more important things than Celia.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.842
- You sure?
- Very.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.281
Good to have you on board.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.361
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.607
What was that for?

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.520
I didn't wish you happy birthday yet.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.805
<i>When there's</i>
a <i>smile in your heart</i>

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.804
<i>There's no better way to start</i>

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.646
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.041
<i>When you leave your past behind</i>

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.561
How did he get in there?

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.886
It's okay.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.240
Dad, be careful.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.850
There it goes.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.406
It's okay.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.566
Stay behind me.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.680
Wow.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.329
Guys, there is a kangaroo out there.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.321
And an emu.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.284
And a cockatoo.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.364
And a wallaby.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.929
Wow,
you really know your animals.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.201
Yeah, they're all Australian.
What's going on?

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.886
I don't think they were
meant to be presented in quite this way.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.166
- No.
- Hi!

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.086
You must be the Coopers.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.643
Hey, yeah!
This was supposed to be a petting zoo?

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.887
A confined Australian petting zoo.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.846
Yeah, it is. One of the pens was
open and the kangaroo got out.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.570
Oh, yeah, the kangaroo.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.688
There was also a crocodile
in our entry hall.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.244
So sorry about that.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.448
We had him in the pool,
and we got distracted.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.801
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll put him back in the pen.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.330
Okay, you got him from here on out?

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.169
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Thanks.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.326
We got you, Mr. Cooper.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.205
- It'll be fine, right?
- Yeah.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.645
- I don't think he's gonna get out again.
- No.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.484
You guys did all of this for me?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.527
Yeah! Your mom and I thought you
might enjoy a night in the Outback.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.011
You can pet him if you want.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.407
His name's Winston.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.121
Hello, Winston.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.851
This is amazing.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.365
Okay, guys?
We've got guests coming any minute.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:20.890
So here's what we have to do.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.611
Emily, you're on music.
Anthony, fire up the barbie.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.408
Mom, snacks.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:26.970
Alexander, why don't
you help Mom keep

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.649
Trevor away from
anything that will eat him?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.603
Baby safety. 10-4.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.205
I think we're all good now.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.366
Super Coopers!

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.401
Super Coopers!

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.209
Lenny! Get back here.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.486
Lenny! Someone get him!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.569
- I am on it!
- Ben!

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.051
Lenny!

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.206
- Ben!
- Dad?

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.341
Lenny!

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.081
Okay!

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.245
That was pretty good!

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:14.725
Where are you?

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.966
Where are you?

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.086
Hey!

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.091
Hey there...

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.765
Party kangaroo.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.801
I'm Ben...

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.721
and I want you to join me...

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.966
back at the party.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:47.560
Yeah!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.965
Nice work, Mr. Cooper.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.087
Thank you, Dwayne.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.929
Come here, Lenny. Here we go.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.651
What's up, man?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.520
Pretty cool, huh?

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.329
This party's gonna be killer, dude.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.641
Hey, guys!

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.090
Your dad is hardcore!

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.685
Dude, did you see that?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.450
- Hey! Hey!
- G'day.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.244
You must be my Australian cowboys.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.129
- We sure are.
- Awesome!

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.891
Wow! You guys are in good shape.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.006
Hey, Nina, how are you?

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.325
It's the video game guys!

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.920
Uh-huh.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.485
- Yeah.
- No, it's a great time to talk.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.524
No. Just a little bit of the hair
was singed.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.211
- Really?
- I know.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.685
I know that was a lot of shrimp!

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.761
Dude!

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.241
Hey, you came!

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.240
Happy birthday!

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.721
This looks amazing!

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.490
Yeah, thanks.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.331
Look, this has been
a really, really crazy day.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.049
Looks like it turned out
pretty good to me.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.401
Yeah.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.651
Have a good weekend, Nina...

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.926
Have a good weekend, Greg.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.764
- And thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your call.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.841
Thanks.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.005
How are you? How was that call?

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.530
It was great. I got the job!

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.486
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.326
It's fantastic!

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.289
They thought I was fun!

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.361
Even after you singed your arms...

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.050
Even after the thing and the thing.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.320
"I still have me arms"?

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.562
I was a fiery pirate! They loved it!

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.201
Wow!

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.170
You know what the best thing is?

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.324
As long as I'm getting the work done...

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.129
I can make my own hours.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.090
I'll be able to still do carpool
and see the kids all the time.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.962
Wow, I am so happy for you.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.010
What about you?
What about your call? How did it go?

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.287
Dick Van Dyke's reading went viral.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.885
500,000 hits today.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.605
You're kidding me.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.483
Nina says the book
is gonna be huge.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.925
That is fantastic, sweetie!

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.961
Yeah...

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.201
it's great!

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.611
I cannot believe
we pulled this party off.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.129
We really turned this day around.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.001
What's that?

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.361
What are they doing?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.004
That's the Thunder from Down Under.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.969
They're supposed to be
authentic Australian cowboys.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.001
They're not.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.487
No, no, no!

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.564
Guys? Guys, PG!

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.971
PG! Keep it PG!

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.560
Please!

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.330
Oh, no.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.846
Go, Alex!
Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex!

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:10.321
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.328
<i>After today, I know that...</i>

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.362
<i>even terrible days aren't so bad</i>

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.363
<i>when you're surrounded
by the people you love.</i>

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.966
Make a wish, kiddo.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.201
<i>Because it turns out...</i>

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.730
<i>the worse things</i> are...

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.410
<i>the better this family gets.</i>

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.166
To more days like this.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.361
No!

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.323
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.522
<i>For us, this bad</i> day...

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.005
<i>was the best day ever!</i>
