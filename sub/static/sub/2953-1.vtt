00:39.356 --> 00:40.505
<i>I'm gonna tell you something.</i>

00:42.670 --> 00:44.307
<i>I been a bad man.</i>

00:45.451 --> 00:48.516
<i>I've been a very bad man, most of my life.</i>

00:48.858 --> 00:50.705
<i>I learned to not trust anybody.</i>

00:52.560 --> 00:54.952
<i>I lost my faith in mankind.</i>

01:06.239 --> 01:08.921
<i>I decided I wanna do one thing...</i>

01:11.267 --> 01:12.824
<i>in my life.</i>

01:14.292 --> 01:17.209
<i>One good thing, in my life, before I die.</i>

01:28.346 --> 01:30.470
<i>Even if I die in the process.</i>

01:32.773 --> 01:35.540
<i>I need to do that for my own absolution.</i>

02:14.930 --> 02:16.658
John, come on in.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.505
As always, I... I appreciate the courtesy.

02:20.733 --> 02:21.821
Please.

02:27.374 --> 02:28.794
We have a situation.

02:29.015 --> 02:32.597
Well... you usually got a situation
when you call me. Ain't that right?

02:37.452 --> 02:40.027
Kamal Mekhi, Afghani national.

02:40.567 --> 02:44.008
He's attempting to procure stealth technology
for the Iranians and I think he can do it.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.355
Intel says that he has very close ties to Pakistan.

02:47.628 --> 02:50.619
But, he's very smart and very well protected.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.480
Which folks hired you to hire me, now?

02:56.831 --> 02:59.928
- John, i-it's a new column.
- A new column?

03:00.195 --> 03:02.179
You're a very unique player in our world, John.

03:03.255 --> 03:06.435
And I only come to you when I know
you're the only guy who can do the job.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.108
Well, I mean, I can do it quietly, man.
You know that. I can do it quietly.

03:15.465 --> 03:18.579
But if you're using me for some kind of
political gain, I'll come back and kill you.

03:18.664 --> 03:20.009
I just want you to know that.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.274
Listen. Does that mean, uh...
does that mean you'll do it?

03:23.560 --> 03:25.339
It means, I'm gonna check him out.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.541
And, um... if turns out that he's really a bad guy

03:30.679 --> 03:33.003
and he's really an enemy of the
United States of America...

03:33.801 --> 03:38.424
or he's really funding terrorist
activity, or any of those things...

03:39.032 --> 03:41.110
I'll make him disappear.

04:14.594 --> 04:15.977
Hey, Johnno.

04:22.052 --> 04:24.824
- How was the flight?
- Long, but good to see you.

04:26.608 --> 04:29.264
Everything's set up. Safe
house and gear, operational.

04:29.626 --> 04:31.983
Exit route goes hot as soon as you make the call.

04:32.676 --> 04:33.931
We playin'?

04:34.687 --> 04:36.220
- Hop.
- Rock and Roll.

04:36.806 --> 04:37.944
I'll get started.

05:40.621 --> 05:41.716
How many?

05:42.087 --> 05:44.378
Unknown, two cars, windows blacked out.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.308
Get ready to go in, on my mark.

06:08.276 --> 06:11.025
Diana, stunning, as always.

06:26.882 --> 06:28.884
Thirty girls a month.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.231
You know us men and our appetites.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.161
Boss'd actually like to do more.

06:35.443 --> 06:41.669
We can talk. Actually, my uncle is coming
from Kabul, for my aunt's funeral.

06:42.406 --> 06:45.704
And he's very close to Kamal's cousin.

06:45.756 --> 06:50.471
The man with the connections. I
think he'd like to meet the Boss.

06:50.991 --> 06:53.430
He's sick of Kamal.

06:54.102 --> 06:57.333
- Like all of us.
- Well, I'll be sure to pass along the invitation.

06:57.493 --> 07:00.812
Kamal is becoming a real risk.

07:01.715 --> 07:04.506
And you know this, as well as me.

07:07.539 --> 07:10.256
How is the fuckin' Afghani parasite, tonight?

07:30.429 --> 07:34.097
Yeah, I bought them from Diana. She has good taste.

07:34.940 --> 07:38.750
You should talk to her, you
know, if chicks are your thing.

07:39.934 --> 07:41.823
But you're certainly not my type.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.040
You know, you've been drawing a lot
of attention to yourself, lately.

07:45.623 --> 07:47.817
I'm not talking about that now.

07:48.361 --> 07:52.532
I don't fucking work for you. There is
only one way the product gets to you.

07:53.097 --> 07:57.115
Me. And I do whatever the fuck I want.
Just like the Boss.

07:57.173 --> 08:00.804
How's that for attracting fucking attention?

08:01.737 --> 08:03.995
The Boss wanted to relay his concerns.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.765
See, some of us really aren't into taking risks.

08:08.130 --> 08:11.238
Don't worry. You think I'm a tribal peasant?

08:11.829 --> 08:16.203
I went to Oxford. I'm smarter and
better connected that you'll ever be.

08:18.777 --> 08:20.085
Sure.

08:20.854 --> 08:22.987
But just so you should know,
the Americans aren't happy.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.819
Oh, fuck the Americans. Get the
hell out of here, now what the...

08:37.607 --> 08:40.075
- Have a good night.
- Oh, fuck you!

08:46.938 --> 08:51.826
Now, we're gonna go in, when they come out.
Nobody's gonna see us. Make it clean.

09:01.462 --> 09:03.155
How was the party?

09:05.583 --> 09:08.984
You know, it'd be a shame to be stuck inside
tonight, on such a beautiful evening as this.

09:10.089 --> 09:12.175
Maybe I will take a walk.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.040
Fresh air will do me good.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.766
Hey, what's the score?

12:39.782 --> 12:41.495
One more coming up the stairs.

12:54.677 --> 12:56.166
What the fuck is the...

13:02.132 --> 13:04.527
But I'm protected, what the fuck is...

13:05.669 --> 13:07.575
OK. Take it easy, man. Take it easy.

13:09.566 --> 13:12.301
Listen. Um...

13:12.718 --> 13:17.572
My family is very rich. What the... what is
wrong with you? What's your problem, man?

13:18.168 --> 13:20.149
Where your family got that money?

13:21.344 --> 13:25.003
This is my family business. Is not your business.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.561
Your family business is a problem, but,

13:27.579 --> 13:31.178
your mouth is even a bigger problem.
You're kind of a liability.

13:31.179 --> 13:33.907
And do you think this is about me?
Get out of here, man.

13:34.290 --> 13:38.795
No-no-no, it's not about you. It's about my bosses.

13:40.642 --> 13:42.665
You're the American?

13:50.813 --> 13:52.526
Leave the girls.

15:36.379 --> 15:40.082
- Is the shopping done?
- Yeah, man, I got everything that was on the list.

15:40.241 --> 15:42.105
It's all done and done right.

15:43.374 --> 15:47.445
- Anything to return?
- No, man, I'm just waiting for reimbursement.

15:47.524 --> 15:49.783
<i>There's been a timing change.</i>

15:50.488 --> 15:51.978
Well, what does that mean?

15:52.521 --> 15:56.727
The exit route is, uh... closed, well, delayed.
We got a problem on our end.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.565
Look, there's nothing to worry about, John.
I would let you know otherwise, alright?

16:00.612 --> 16:03.666
Right now, the exit wagon is
parked, until I get the go, no-go.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.539
<i>So, just stay invisible, until I get back to you.</i>

16:08.027 --> 16:09.359
Roger that.

16:12.261 --> 16:14.060
We got a little delay.

16:15.352 --> 16:19.764
- Oh. Should we be concerned?
- I mean, the problem is the job's not over, yet.

16:19.807 --> 16:23.743
What I would recommend is, we go over to
the Danube Club, have a drink and just relax.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.484
Lay low. We're ghosts, always ghosts.

16:28.091 --> 16:31.844
- And, uh... we get out of here,  right away.
- OK.

17:04.881 --> 17:08.651
- Give me, uh... some scotch. Johny Walker.
- OK.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.492
And some cigars.

18:54.244 --> 18:55.275
Hey.

18:57.444 --> 18:58.795
Sorry, a little late.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.135
I got a massage.

19:00.323 --> 19:02.458
Took me a little bit longer than expected.

19:02.483 --> 19:07.145
- You must have had a massage with a happy ending.
- I'm telling you, the women here are amazing.

19:07.822 --> 19:09.601
You don't see this in Hong Kong.

19:10.618 --> 19:14.786
I don't know, man. Back in the day, were
pretty good in Hong Kong, too, you know.

19:23.781 --> 19:27.085
Let me ask you something. Three years ago...

19:31.121 --> 19:32.716
I was walking by...

19:37.355 --> 19:43.176
You and your boss went to get out of a car and...
there was a little girl in there.

19:44.051 --> 19:47.916
Bad guys jumped up, to kill your boss.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.595
And it looked to me like...

19:50.845 --> 19:55.818
the little girl was gonna die, in the process.
I'm an operator, so it's second nature, for me.

19:56.470 --> 19:59.833
I went in and did some bad things to those folks.

20:00.471 --> 20:02.951
And they were gone forever. Just so happens...

20:02.983 --> 20:09.548
the guy I saved... he was one of the big
godfathers of Hong Kong. That was your boss.

20:11.327 --> 20:13.970
He gives you to me, for a year...

20:14.193 --> 20:18.669
as a... gift, for a debt that he thought...

20:18.838 --> 20:20.454
he owes me.

20:21.649 --> 20:25.653
That was three years ago.
Why I can't get rid of you?

20:32.589 --> 20:34.412
Remember the Macau job?

20:35.607 --> 20:36.808
I do.

20:36.895 --> 20:40.214
- Well, you saved my life, on that one.
- That's what we do.

20:41.123 --> 20:42.495
That's what we do.

20:42.546 --> 20:45.499
From that point on, this was no
longer about repaying a debt.

20:46.033 --> 20:50.515
OK? You became my 'hintai.' My brother.

20:52.226 --> 20:54.101
Where I come from, there's a saying.

21:01.281 --> 21:03.719
It means, when the knives come
out, if you're my brother,

21:03.738 --> 21:06.233
I'll be there for you. No words need to be spoken.

21:06.912 --> 21:08.819
As the tong's enforcer,

21:08.831 --> 21:13.092
the Red Pope, I'll do whatever
it takes to honor them.

21:16.380 --> 21:17.835
That's how we do, man.

21:18.014 --> 21:21.784
We live together, we die together.
We walk together, we fight together.

21:22.068 --> 21:23.189
Damn right.

21:35.388 --> 21:37.315
Talk about living.

21:37.495 --> 21:38.932
Excuse me, Johnno.

21:41.893 --> 21:42.985
Hey.

21:45.921 --> 21:47.915
- How are you?
- Hi, how are you?

21:47.972 --> 21:50.046
- OK, what's your name?
- I'm Angela.

21:50.095 --> 21:51.966
Angela, OK. I'm Chi.

21:52.046 --> 21:53.104
Hi, Chi.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.937
You can run, but I'm gonna catch ya.

24:14.551 --> 24:15.884
Help me.

24:17.138 --> 24:18.238
Help!

24:18.257 --> 24:19.641
Help me.

24:25.772 --> 24:27.272
Help! Help!

24:33.191 --> 24:37.054
Please! Please, help me. They will kill me.
Please, please, help me.

24:37.274 --> 24:39.321
- Please-please-please, please help me.
- This are none of your business.

24:39.477 --> 24:40.817
Don't you touch me, man.

24:41.976 --> 24:43.464
- Stay out of this.
- Please, they will kill me.

24:43.924 --> 24:45.405
That's enough, come on.

24:50.483 --> 24:52.625
You heard the woman. Leave her alone.

25:06.899 --> 25:08.925
- No, you don't...
- Let her go.

25:43.390 --> 25:45.415
- We have to leave.
- Separately.

25:46.059 --> 25:48.155
Let me know where to meet with you, though.

25:54.742 --> 25:56.072
Wait!

26:01.836 --> 26:03.668
Please. Please, please.

26:03.716 --> 26:07.175
- What are you doing here, man?
- I ha-I have nowhere to go, OK?

26:08.938 --> 26:10.246
They will kill me.

26:10.275 --> 26:12.568
Well, move fast and get away from here.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.944
Go on.

26:15.413 --> 26:16.904
- Get out of here.
- No.

26:23.185 --> 26:27.168
Listen to me. I have done
everything I can do for you.

26:27.327 --> 26:29.956
Please, get out of the car, you have
very little time, before they come.

26:30.003 --> 26:33.978
I just know you must be an important man, OK?
I see that, and...

26:34.034 --> 26:36.989
what happens to me doesn't matter.
I know that, too.

26:41.905 --> 26:43.685
But you're not like them.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.277
Please.

26:52.568 --> 26:53.966
You're sure I'm not like them, huh?

26:53.985 --> 26:56.964
Yes, you're not like them.
But you're not like them.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.276
- Would you bet your life on it?
- Yes.

27:14.379 --> 27:16.701
Yeah, I'm not like them.

27:45.316 --> 27:48.356
The Afghani got hit tonight. High-end pros.
The perimiter guard guard didn't see a thing.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.214
What should we do about it?

27:50.264 --> 27:52.985
Do about it? That waste of space was a liability.

27:54.252 --> 27:56.369
You know what? He just happened to
be the direct line to our product,

27:56.388 --> 27:58.523
so I guess what we're gonna have to do is...

27:58.535 --> 27:59.939
- get another line.
- How are you?

28:00.314 --> 28:02.189
I'm well, this fine night. How about yourself?

28:02.590 --> 28:06.135
Thank you, fine. You've got four
messages and Victor needs to see you.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.267
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

28:07.326 --> 28:10.372
Well, there's something else. three of our
men got taken down at the Danube Club.

28:10.797 --> 28:13.537
They were chasing a girl. We
think it's connected to the hit.

28:13.562 --> 28:14.680
What girl?

28:14.682 --> 28:18.487
Well, she was with, uh... our friend.

28:21.653 --> 28:23.010
Shit.

28:23.499 --> 28:26.878
- What about the men?
- Well, he left them alive, on purpose.

28:27.010 --> 28:28.578
- He?
- Yeah.

28:28.596 --> 28:33.096
- So, you're saying one guy did this?
- Well, he had a partner. An Asian guy.

28:33.137 --> 28:35.035
But the girl went with him.

28:47.704 --> 28:49.368
You brought the girl here?

28:50.062 --> 28:53.118
Yeah, I really fucked up, man. I broke protocol.

28:59.649 --> 29:02.153
Listen, there's a lot of
eyes on us, at the club, OK?

29:02.411 --> 29:06.923
Now this girl? We don't know who she is, who's
tryin' to kill her and why. This is dangerous, man.

29:07.282 --> 29:09.833
I just didn't wanna see them
slaughter her, you know?

29:14.697 --> 29:16.504
Alright, what's your plan?

29:16.696 --> 29:19.342
What I was gonna do is just
give her a little bit of money and

29:19.701 --> 29:22.666
drop her off in a safe place. Then
you and I get the fuck out of here.

29:22.691 --> 29:24.442
Yeah, we're gonna need some help.

29:24.467 --> 29:26.660
I got a Russian friend.

29:26.758 --> 29:31.248
I'm gonna call him and see if he can get us
a clean extraction and some of our tools.

30:04.142 --> 30:08.676
You wanna tell me what happened? We kinda need
to know what's goin' on, so we can help you.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.457
You don't wanna know.

30:15.649 --> 30:18.073
Yeah, we better know... if
you want us to help you.

30:18.260 --> 30:21.604
If you wanna stay alive, I think you
kinda gotta level with us, otherwise

30:21.991 --> 30:24.368
I'm out. You gotta tell us everything

30:24.756 --> 30:28.379
and you gotta listen to every
motherfucking thing I tell you to do.

30:28.422 --> 30:29.647
They will kill you.

30:29.672 --> 30:31.181
Oh, no.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.997
What shall we do, Chi?

30:33.031 --> 30:34.337
I'm terrified.

30:34.883 --> 30:36.190
Should we run?

30:38.423 --> 30:40.415
Why don't you just humor us?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.335
I was supposed to come here...

30:47.707 --> 30:51.064
to take care of babies, for rich families.

30:51.824 --> 30:53.619
Three years.

30:55.761 --> 30:58.267
Three fucking years!

31:00.085 --> 31:01.888
John, take a look at this.

31:10.916 --> 31:15.199
You wanna tell me about these? I mean,
they were in the coat you were wearing.

31:15.200 --> 31:19.650
See, something isn't right and it's really not
smart for us to go ahead and expose ourselves...

31:20.508 --> 31:23.307
without knowing exactly what's happening, so...

31:24.408 --> 31:26.063
I don't know, man.

31:26.371 --> 31:28.022
I'm thinking about maybe...

31:29.146 --> 31:33.322
givin' her some money... and
sendin' her on her way.

31:33.884 --> 31:37.943
Unless she tells me everything, and I
don't think she's telling me everything.

31:42.392 --> 31:45.775
Take a look at this. There's a
page, torn out, with names on it.

31:47.359 --> 31:49.617
Nadia and Sofia.

31:51.567 --> 31:52.965
Who's Sofia?

31:56.679 --> 31:59.579
Sofia was my sister!

32:04.535 --> 32:07.305
And he beat her to death with a pipe!

32:13.304 --> 32:17.299
Do you know who he is, or where he
took you, or anything like that?

32:20.661 --> 32:23.626
It was strange from the start, OK?

32:27.631 --> 32:31.683
A woman came first and... looked us over and...

32:34.895 --> 32:36.788
and then they came.

32:38.535 --> 32:41.296
And they got me, Sofia and two other girls.

32:41.314 --> 32:42.358
These are the girls.

32:44.705 --> 32:49.331
Then they took us to this... nightclub, and...

32:50.208 --> 32:54.910
and we went down, to a strange room...
like a kitchen.

32:58.452 --> 33:01.268
And this guy was there...

33:01.694 --> 33:03.931
with his mask.

33:10.949 --> 33:12.811
Say you aren't afraid!

33:14.080 --> 33:17.013
There! You like that?

33:20.420 --> 33:24.542
There are some sick people, in this world, OK?

33:25.666 --> 33:28.244
But if they have enough money...

33:29.367 --> 33:32.489
they'll get away with anything!

33:38.329 --> 33:39.521
Bitch!

33:42.264 --> 33:43.764
Look at her.

33:44.383 --> 33:45.903
Look at her.

34:17.741 --> 34:21.116
Someone's... someone's gotta live.

34:28.255 --> 34:31.579
Lay still, or I'll cut you open, you bitch.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.156
Nadia, take the camera! Run!

34:37.174 --> 34:39.274
Run, Nadia, run!

35:01.544 --> 35:04.051
You can run, but I'm gonna catch ya!

35:10.758 --> 35:12.248
Bitch.

35:20.664 --> 35:21.856
OK.

35:22.626 --> 35:25.096
Now, you'll have to pay for this.

35:41.323 --> 35:43.629
She won't get far. Go get her.

35:48.024 --> 35:51.931
You know who he is, or where he
took you, or anything like that?

35:52.600 --> 35:54.083
I don't know.

35:56.330 --> 36:01.450
All I know is that... they have a very
powerful syndicate here, and you guys...

36:02.049 --> 36:05.014
you guys, you just beat up their men, at the bar.

36:08.497 --> 36:10.234
Nadia.

36:11.068 --> 36:12.940
I'm gonna tell you something.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.344
I've been a bad man.

36:17.061 --> 36:20.410
I've been a very bad man, most of my life.

36:22.957 --> 36:25.616
I learned to not trust anybody.

36:26.666 --> 36:29.727
I lost my faith in mankind.

36:32.032 --> 36:35.532
I believe that everybody out
there, is out there to fuck me.

36:39.266 --> 36:44.872
So, I decided, I wanna do one thing, in my life.

36:46.402 --> 36:49.497
One good thing, in my life, before I die.

36:50.447 --> 36:53.131
Even if I die in the process.

36:57.135 --> 36:59.195
I wanna find this guy.

37:06.087 --> 37:08.821
I wanna find him and I wanna kill him.

37:11.847 --> 37:15.288
I need to do that, for my own absolution.

37:19.382 --> 37:21.193
He had a camera.

37:22.694 --> 37:24.802
When I escaped, I took it.

37:27.018 --> 37:30.636
He filmed everything. Everything!

37:39.465 --> 37:41.916
I can show you where I hid it.

38:20.514 --> 38:23.166
Deathly silence.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.055
It's not a good sign.

38:26.762 --> 38:30.307
Seems we may have hired the
wrong team for the Afghani job.

38:43.786 --> 38:45.193
We?

38:46.181 --> 38:50.018
I guess that'd be me, sir. I hired
the wrong team for the Afghani job.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.703
Shut up, Colt.

39:04.023 --> 39:06.131
We need to sort this shit out.

39:06.617 --> 39:08.526
Get Van Horn on the phone.

39:09.471 --> 39:11.687
Look, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.441
<i>The Afghani job was going smoothly.</i>

39:14.666 --> 39:18.964
Until three of my men, all of a
sudden, got jumped, in a bar.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.508
Well, that sounds like a bad day,
all around, now, doesn't it?

39:24.511 --> 39:28.806
Do you have any idea how quickly I
can get rid of you and your men?

39:31.453 --> 39:34.950
Look, I thought the Afghani job was...
gonna take care of everything.

39:35.175 --> 39:36.315
Clean, done and done.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.314
<i>One of your men has taken a woman.</i>

39:38.332 --> 39:40.054
She belongs to me.

39:40.455 --> 39:42.779
Now you listen, very carefully.

39:43.564 --> 39:45.517
I want her back.

39:51.470 --> 39:55.235
John... now, you didn't say
anything about rescuing a woman.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.104
Well, it wasn't exactly part of the plan.

39:57.299 --> 39:59.260
<i>Well, that's gonna be a bit of a problem.</i>

39:59.303 --> 40:03.189
The guy who ordered he hit, he wants to
know why you took her and where she is.

40:04.248 --> 40:06.756
I wonder what he's so interested in her for, man?

40:06.899 --> 40:10.382
Look, that's not a question I was gonna
ask, considering we broke protocol.

40:10.693 --> 40:13.569
Now look, we get the girl back to
them and this all goes away.

40:15.752 --> 40:17.970
Well, remember, you owe me a
lot of fuckin' favors, so

40:17.995 --> 40:21.653
just buy me some time, so I can figure
a way out of this shit. You hear me?

40:25.791 --> 40:28.060
<i>We got the lock. Sending address.</i>

40:28.139 --> 40:29.261
Got it.

40:30.641 --> 40:32.144
We got a lock on him.

40:33.794 --> 40:35.886
Well, go and get my property.

40:46.579 --> 40:47.771
Good.

40:49.425 --> 40:50.617
Right.

40:51.048 --> 40:53.848
Right. Fifteen Tankarnya.

40:54.526 --> 40:57.657
Clean up this mess. Let me know
when you've got the girl.

41:15.805 --> 41:17.820
I'm a friend of John's.

41:32.897 --> 41:34.689
This is Sergei.

41:34.689 --> 41:36.371
He's, uh... my brother.

41:36.569 --> 41:38.249
And you should trust him.

41:38.322 --> 41:40.772
I've trusted him many times.

41:42.741 --> 41:45.740
We're gonna need a clean extraction.
Nice and quiet, nice and quick.

41:45.788 --> 41:48.535
- How soon?
- Well, I'd say, 24 hours, huh?

41:52.877 --> 41:54.297
Give me two hours.

41:54.794 --> 41:58.861
There's a bad guy here that we need to
find and, uh... give him a kiss goodnight.

41:59.672 --> 42:04.229
After we do that, there's a camera we're
gonna grab. And we're out of here.

42:04.253 --> 42:06.253
That's all we want, right now.

42:06.586 --> 42:08.869
You two guys go to the address in the notebook.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.788
Find out who this guy is.

42:18.803 --> 42:20.414
OK, let's rock and roll.

42:20.446 --> 42:22.082
Let's rock and roll.

43:14.831 --> 43:16.920
Hey, buddy, uh... you wanna... you have a light?

43:18.752 --> 43:19.911
Thanks.

43:30.874 --> 43:34.578
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.
Answer, you live. Lie, you die.

43:34.780 --> 43:36.002
Understand?

43:37.757 --> 43:39.127
You understand?

43:45.880 --> 43:47.695
He only speaks Russian.

43:48.564 --> 43:50.743
That's why I brought my translator.

43:51.922 --> 43:53.129
What's in this building?

44:03.918 --> 44:05.018
Girls.

44:05.043 --> 44:06.244
What girls?

44:10.376 --> 44:12.376
What girls?

44:15.975 --> 44:17.535
Human trafficking.

44:18.671 --> 44:19.963
Tell me who runs it.

44:22.801 --> 44:24.125
Pull 'em.

44:42.308 --> 44:43.735
Jesus!

44:44.645 --> 44:45.927
What'd he say?

44:47.657 --> 44:50.892
He said it's run by the fuckin' syndicate.

44:51.066 --> 44:53.686
Everything's run by the syndicate.
What the fuck is the syndicate?

44:53.874 --> 44:55.316
I'll check my sources.

45:02.073 --> 45:03.265
Hey.

45:07.721 --> 45:09.969
I haven't eaten in days.

45:11.378 --> 45:13.771
And I'm a bit cold, also.

45:14.024 --> 45:17.596
There's a place, couple of doors down.
Some great food.

45:17.752 --> 45:19.834
I'll pick up some clothes, as well.

45:22.350 --> 45:26.253
You're obviously not safe, if you leave here.

45:29.703 --> 45:32.869
Before we start, is there
anything I should know about you?

45:33.606 --> 45:36.736
My father, he used to work
with John, in these regions.

45:38.630 --> 45:41.304
Odessa used to be a safe city.

45:43.448 --> 45:44.856
When?

45:47.492 --> 45:49.391
Before all this.

45:54.060 --> 45:56.790
This is nothing, compared to where I come from.

46:47.315 --> 46:49.383
I'm not gonna go.

46:49.706 --> 46:51.501
I'm gonna be here with you.

46:54.847 --> 46:57.771
I'm just gonna talk to the doctor,
for one second, sweetheart.

46:58.934 --> 47:00.134
OK?

48:05.356 --> 48:08.096
- Nadia, you OK?
- How did they find us?

48:31.494 --> 48:33.652
They'll recognize your face.

48:36.728 --> 48:39.014
Only if I go inside.

48:56.499 --> 48:58.977
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.

48:59.420 --> 49:01.775
- Hey. Excuse me.
- What?

49:02.054 --> 49:04.995
Do you mind I buy a ticket, for a second?
I need to talk to her. Yeah, come here.

49:05.396 --> 49:06.671
Hey!

49:06.690 --> 49:08.940
Hey, it's me. It's me, Chi. Do you remember me?

49:09.567 --> 49:10.779
- Angela, right?
- Yeah?

49:10.789 --> 49:12.605
Just need to talk to you, for a second, OK?

49:12.712 --> 49:15.514
Now, those guys I was fighting...
hey. Those guys I was fighting?

49:15.996 --> 49:18.669
Who were they? Do you have any idea?
Cops, or anything?

49:19.491 --> 49:20.970
I-I don't know, but...

49:21.530 --> 49:24.380
They had-they had some kind of...
badges, or something. I...

49:24.523 --> 49:25.892
- Some kind of badges?
- Yeah.

49:26.030 --> 49:28.319
What kind badge? Do you have any idea?

49:29.612 --> 49:30.913
Hey, leave him alone!

49:30.953 --> 49:32.431
And do you know where they went?

49:32.480 --> 49:35.374
Um... St. Andrew's Hospital?

49:35.802 --> 49:37.711
Somebody took them to St. Andrew's hospital?

49:37.900 --> 49:39.029
- Yeah.
- OK.

49:41.040 --> 49:45.643
Thank you. I, uh... here's a little something
for you. Just, uh... just keep it.

49:45.661 --> 49:46.674
- Thanks.
- OK. I'll

49:46.693 --> 49:49.730
catch you next time, OK? Alright? You're welcome.

49:51.961 --> 49:53.647
Let's go. Let's go.

50:22.225 --> 50:25.940
These are from the security cameras in the club.
These are the guys, right?

50:26.226 --> 50:28.864
Diplomatic military security.

50:29.228 --> 50:31.706
- How do you know?
- They're not Ukrainian.

50:32.739 --> 50:34.464
I wonder what he's showing them.

50:50.638 --> 50:52.797
Hey, I wanna have a chat with them.

50:53.184 --> 50:54.578
No problem.

51:07.896 --> 51:10.672
We have no contact from the
team we sent to Tankarnaya.

51:12.827 --> 51:15.577
Look, this guy's not going anywhere any time soon.

51:15.654 --> 51:17.274
He's after something.

51:17.752 --> 51:22.078
Whatever it was that the girl took from the Boss...
for some reason, the American wants it now.

51:23.297 --> 51:25.683
Send more than our team. Make
sure they don't fuck this up.

51:26.052 --> 51:28.328
- Will do.
- I'm gonna chat with the Boss.

51:41.715 --> 51:45.215
<i>Fifteen Tankarnya. Copy that. Arriving now.</i>

51:45.334 --> 51:48.524
<i>Make sure you take the girl alive.
Kill everyone else there.</i>

52:45.305 --> 52:47.522
You're hanging around with the wrong people.

52:54.563 --> 52:56.055
Holy fuck!

53:19.698 --> 53:21.973
<i>Victor, he's running with the girl.
I'm on his tail now.</i>

53:33.008 --> 53:35.666
Do you remember exactly where you hid the camera?

53:36.861 --> 53:37.961
Of course.

53:37.990 --> 53:42.212
Well, that would be good, because once we get in
there, we're not gonna have any time, you hear?

53:42.430 --> 53:43.830
Hang on!

54:06.370 --> 54:08.939
Alright, I'll take those two.
Watch my back, alright?

56:17.453 --> 56:19.613
Alright, so tell me about the girl.

56:20.111 --> 56:21.519
Fuck you, chink.

56:28.754 --> 56:32.129
That's Chi, not chink. That's not polite.

56:32.797 --> 56:35.753
Now, when I get pissed off, I
do crazy, fucked up things.

56:36.525 --> 56:40.428
Like pouring hot scalding
water on people's faces, OK?

56:41.716 --> 56:43.686
- So who do you work for?
- Fuck you.

56:47.388 --> 56:48.580
Huh?

56:49.048 --> 56:50.688
We work for the Boss.

56:52.019 --> 56:54.144
The Boss? Who the fuck is the Boss?

56:54.801 --> 56:56.038
What does he want with the girl?

56:56.063 --> 56:57.274
You don't know?

56:57.299 --> 56:59.890
Yeah, I don't know. That's
why I'm asking you, asshole.

57:08.457 --> 57:11.184
Oh, soup! Even better.

57:36.065 --> 57:38.166
<i>Ralphie, I need a favor.</i>

57:38.291 --> 57:40.469
- <i>What can you tell me about the syndicate?</i>
- Shit.

57:40.487 --> 57:41.987
<i>It's important.</i>

57:45.185 --> 57:46.377
Yeah, OK.

57:50.233 --> 57:52.152
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah.

57:52.195 --> 57:54.610
The "Boss." Mean anything to you?

57:55.350 --> 57:58.985
Just checked my sources. He's the
head of the local syndicate.

58:07.164 --> 58:10.557
Yeah, so these guys are operators,
working for someone called the Boss.

58:10.582 --> 58:12.537
Head of the local syndicate.

58:12.562 --> 58:15.024
- <i>You got the camera yet?</i>
- No, we're on our way to get it now.

58:15.248 --> 58:16.694
OK, we'll meet you. Where?

58:16.919 --> 58:18.920
It's a place called Club One.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.349
Club One, you know it?

58:21.739 --> 58:24.570
- Would it be open this time of day?
- Yeah, it never closes.

58:24.595 --> 58:25.917
We'll be there in ten.

59:03.780 --> 59:05.221
It should cover it.

59:11.223 --> 59:12.261
Follow me.

59:32.070 --> 59:34.061
The real exit is over there.

59:43.204 --> 59:45.497
Keep your head down, they'll be lookin' for you.

59:56.629 --> 59:58.029
<i>Danko.</i>

59:58.048 --> 01:00:00.238
- Meet me at Club One.
- <i>The Boss's club?</i>

01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:02.069
Yeah, they're here.

01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:39.706
- Upstairs. This way.
- Whatever happens, don't run.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.236
Stick onto me, got it?

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:57.479
- So, I see, I hid inside there.
- Alright, get in and out, quick.

01:00:57.497 --> 01:00:58.697
OK.

01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:30.078
- So, this is the place, huh?
- Da, that's the place.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.065
Never closes, huh?

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:54.573
- You take that side. I'll go here.
- OK.

01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:21.190
I want them all. Go.

01:02:26.188 --> 01:02:29.492
- You guys go around the back.
- Yeah, I'll have them all soon.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:31.510
OK.

01:02:53.175 --> 01:02:54.367
Hey!

01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:58.575
- What are you doing here?
- Hanging out. What are you doing here?

01:02:58.586 --> 01:03:00.135
Hanging out.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.108
Go.

01:03:04.126 --> 01:03:06.326
- But why?
- Go! Go now!

01:03:41.677 --> 01:03:46.517
I figured, if they caught me, they still would
not have the evidence of what that monster...

01:03:46.567 --> 01:03:48.715
did to my sister and to the other girls.

01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:53.925
- It's what drove me to keep going.
- Ah, you did the right thing.

01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:58.541
Your sister's, uh... not be gonna
have died in vain. So, let's do this.

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.730
There he is.

01:04:20.348 --> 01:04:21.548
John!

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.843
Come on. Back door. Go.

01:05:30.673 --> 01:05:31.876
Who sent you?

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:34.596
Fuck you!

01:05:39.392 --> 01:05:40.657
For Sergei.

01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:53.278
Come on, Victor's waiting.

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:27.531
Got you, motherfucker. Come on guys, hurry up!

01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:29.588
Put him in the back.

01:06:30.563 --> 01:06:32.145
Faster, faster, faster. Go, go, go!

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:39.244
What are we going to do?

01:06:39.263 --> 01:06:42.066
We're gonna follow them, and
we're gonna get Chi back,

01:06:42.091 --> 01:06:46.349
and then we're gonna probably have to do
some bad things to some of the people there.

01:07:51.407 --> 01:07:57.205
Hey, Colt. No, I haven't got the camera. Yeah, I
know. I know. But I have something else, instead.

01:07:57.257 --> 01:07:59.112
OK, I just got here.

01:08:41.906 --> 01:08:45.447
- Yes, sir.
- Now, why don't you sound surprised?

01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:49.299
Well, they located my safe house. I think
you're the only one who coulda done that, so...

01:08:49.934 --> 01:08:51.537
Why'd you rat me out?

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:54.932
<i>I admire you, John. Always have.</i>

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.147
<i>Always had your six, you know that.</i>

01:08:57.513 --> 01:08:59.116
<i>But now you know too much.</i>

01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:03.265
Which means it comes down to me and you.
And I'm gonna choose me.

01:09:09.559 --> 01:09:11.002
You know better than that, son.

01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:13.158
<i>I suppose I do.</i>

01:09:13.178 --> 01:09:15.944
<i>See, the thing of it is...</i>

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.738
<i>There's a big difference between...</i>

01:09:18.798 --> 01:09:20.880
a real warrior and a wannabe.

01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:23.578
Wannabes are always talkin'.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.390
And that's the deal with you, Van Horn, you're
always talkin', you always give your position away.

01:09:29.524 --> 01:09:31.782
<i>Real warriors, they don't really say much.</i>

01:09:32.303 --> 01:09:33.868
<i>They just do what they gotta do.</i>

01:09:34.067 --> 01:09:36.053
John, you were supposed to clean up a mess for me.

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:38.993
Clean it up and go away. No harm, no foul.

01:09:40.705 --> 01:09:42.542
Now look what you made me do.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:44.627
<i>And you know how much I hate to travel.</i>

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:51.374
Listen, man... everybody knows
you don't have the camera.

01:09:51.935 --> 01:09:54.868
You don't understand, my friend,
it's not about the camera any more.

01:09:54.942 --> 01:09:57.130
It's not two against one here, John.

01:09:57.174 --> 01:09:58.687
It's two against us.

01:10:02.337 --> 01:10:03.775
You nailed a lot of us.

01:10:05.203 --> 01:10:06.898
I don't care about the Boss.

01:10:09.047 --> 01:10:10.916
<i>I think you're saying you set me up?</i>

01:10:12.029 --> 01:10:15.088
This is kind of what we call,
in the old school, a reversal.

01:10:15.113 --> 01:10:18.697
If I were you, man, you have to
start lookin', really quick.

01:10:19.094 --> 01:10:22.266
Be careful, man, you have to watch your six, now.

01:10:23.068 --> 01:10:24.468
Somebody's comin'.

01:10:25.144 --> 01:10:27.622
- Alright, listen, I'm gonna give you this.
- John, no, please.

01:10:27.647 --> 01:10:29.982
Just listen to me and do what I say.
That was the deal we made.

01:10:30.007 --> 01:10:32.203
Take this. Go on.

01:10:33.713 --> 01:10:38.196
Point it and you shoot. Stay in the car. Don't
get out of the car for nothin', you hear me?

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:48.172
So, I finally get to meet, Chi.

01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:52.502
And I finally get to meet you, Van Horn.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:56.085
So, what'd my good buddy, John, tell you about me?

01:10:57.756 --> 01:11:00.704
He said you're a bald, middle-aged, wannabe.

01:11:03.433 --> 01:11:05.236
Shut him up.

01:11:12.362 --> 01:11:14.968
Hit me a little harder next time, motherfucker.

01:12:02.606 --> 01:12:04.158
He's already here.

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:08.761
You go that way. You come with me.

01:14:03.325 --> 01:14:04.904
That's for Sofia.

01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:10.875
You bitch. The Boss should have
killed both of you whores.

01:14:21.865 --> 01:14:23.427
That's for me.

01:17:13.482 --> 01:17:14.682
We're done here.

01:17:49.636 --> 01:17:51.439
You got shot, you alright?

01:17:53.678 --> 01:17:54.932
Yeah, I'm all good.

01:17:55.423 --> 01:17:58.201
See now, don't say I never
did nothing for you, man.

01:18:00.025 --> 01:18:03.562
- Guess I still got three years, huh?
- What do you got?

01:18:13.838 --> 01:18:15.845
Van Horn's phone, you wanna take a look?

01:18:35.922 --> 01:18:37.322
Van Horn?

01:18:37.741 --> 01:18:39.540
No, try again.

01:18:40.478 --> 01:18:41.926
Been expecting your call.

01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:45.521
You have something of mine. I
hope you're gonna give it back.

01:18:46.707 --> 01:18:49.206
Man, I have problems with that, you see, uh...

01:18:50.011 --> 01:18:53.363
<i>Finally, I figured out why you
ordered Afghani to get killed.</i>

01:18:53.388 --> 01:18:55.522
You ordered the hit on Afghani because

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:58.433
he knew about all the sick shit that you do.

01:18:58.481 --> 01:19:01.087
<i>You don't want everybody to
know your little secret, right?</i>

01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:04.628
- What secret?
- <i>Yeah, your little secret, bitch.</i>

01:19:05.319 --> 01:19:09.365
You know, the one that you recorded on your
camera, that you always record on your camera?

01:19:09.572 --> 01:19:13.386
All the bad habits that you have
and you record on your camera.

01:19:14.909 --> 01:19:18.526
- What do you want?
- <i>I wanna see you in person.</i>

01:19:19.738 --> 01:19:22.908
I wanna see you in person. You know?

01:19:23.002 --> 01:19:25.207
That'll be good for business, won't it?

01:19:25.864 --> 01:19:27.462
<i>Be good for you, good for me.</i>

01:19:29.087 --> 01:19:30.361
Yeah, I'm good with that.

01:19:31.697 --> 01:19:34.320
What about my nightclub, two hours.

01:19:35.196 --> 01:19:38.539
- Right back where it all started.
- Fuck you, bitch.

01:19:44.851 --> 01:19:46.043
John.

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:02.989
I got something for you.

01:20:04.285 --> 01:20:07.552
That's enough for you to really start a new life.

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.642
Get yourself together.

01:20:11.677 --> 01:20:12.769
No.

01:20:17.469 --> 01:20:19.521
I have nothing to go back to.

01:20:24.469 --> 01:20:26.160
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:30.094 --> 01:20:34.283
You are tough, aren't you? Well, hug?

01:20:40.582 --> 01:20:41.976
Listen to me.

01:20:43.133 --> 01:20:46.497
You're hurt. I want you to take
care of yourself. Take care of her.

01:20:48.695 --> 01:20:50.336
How's my boy Sergei?

01:20:52.794 --> 01:20:54.194
He didn't make it.

01:20:58.913 --> 01:21:00.326
I'll be right back.

01:21:38.058 --> 01:21:41.867
Bang on time. Good punctuality. I like that.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:45.112
Would you like to join me, at my table?

01:22:05.428 --> 01:22:06.739
So, here we are.

01:22:09.553 --> 01:22:10.753
Now, what do you want?

01:22:15.843 --> 01:22:17.062
I want to kill you.

01:22:19.964 --> 01:22:22.096
I don't think so, not today.

01:22:24.676 --> 01:22:26.064
I'm protected.

01:22:26.606 --> 01:22:28.121
So cut the crap.

01:22:28.767 --> 01:22:30.103
You got something for me?

01:22:32.422 --> 01:22:35.899
Well... as promised, here's your camera.

01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:38.707
It's kind of a reminder of all your good work.

01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:47.277
Yeah.

01:22:49.624 --> 01:22:50.847
Kill him.

01:22:55.363 --> 01:22:57.017
Where's your little friend?

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.343
Let's finish this.

01:23:18.949 --> 01:23:20.489
So you're Chi, huh?

01:23:24.524 --> 01:23:26.068
What the fuck are you?

01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:29.796
I'm the last thing you're ever gonna see.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.972
That's the best you can do?

01:24:43.363 --> 01:24:44.563
Not bad.

01:24:44.907 --> 01:24:48.250
I did like those lads. So let's try this.

01:24:55.394 --> 01:24:56.866
So sure about that now?

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.332
I'm positive.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.927
Alright, you son of a bitch.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.827
OK, I think I've had about enough of this shit.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.585
It's time for you to die.

01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:00.919
- You're out, bitch.
- What now?

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:04.653
What about up close and personal?

01:26:37.264 --> 01:26:39.634
Get up. Get up and fight, bitch.

01:26:43.662 --> 01:26:45.737
No, no more.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:35.814
Why'd you come back?

01:27:37.019 --> 01:27:41.599
- When the knives come out...
- No words need to be spoken.

01:28:05.423 --> 01:28:07.930
<i>That was the last job I ever did for anybody.</i>

01:28:12.276 --> 01:28:14.428
<i>I just figured it was time for a new beginning.</i>

01:28:18.557 --> 01:28:21.303
<i>Time for me to turn my sights
in a different direction.</i>

01:28:24.607 --> 01:28:26.759
<i>Time for me to start things over.</i>

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.290
<i>As for Chi...</i>

01:29:33.784 --> 01:29:37.334
<i>with the debt finally paid,
he decided to stay behind.</i>
