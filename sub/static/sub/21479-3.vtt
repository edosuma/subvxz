00:01.160 --> 00:02.130
Previously on The 4400...

00:02.200 --> 00:03.030
RYLAND:
All right, listen up, everyone.

00:03.100 --> 00:03.200
We're at DEFCON One.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.030
SKOURIS:
A comet cannot change course.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.000
RYLAND:
This one has.

00:08.060 --> 00:09.500
SKOURIS
Then it's not a comet.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.430
REPORTER:
We're not sure
what's just happened.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.630
The light is gone

00:11.700 --> 00:13.200
and thousands of people

00:13.260 --> 00:14.860
have just suddenly appeared...

00:15.030 --> 00:16.137
SKOURIS:
A lekinetic
insurance salesman,

00:16.201 --> 00:18.563
a clairvoyant eight-year
old, and now some kind

00:18.636 --> 00:19.000
of sad sack
super vigilante.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.000
They can't hurt me.

00:22.060 --> 00:24.000
No one can.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.130
And those are only
the ones we know about.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.860
Unless you can think
of anyone else.

00:28.930 --> 00:31.000
There's nothing to tell.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.000
DANNY:
I just want to know what's
going on between you two.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.060
Yore my brother.

00:40.130 --> 00:41.860
She's your girlfriend.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.730
It's all good.

00:45.230 --> 00:47.830
No. Wee not
actually a couple.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.830
So, it's just you
and the baby?

00:48.900 --> 00:51.360
No. It'll be the three of us.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.930
What the hell
did you do to Kyle?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.760
I didn't do anythingo him!

01:00.930 --> 01:02.400
Then can I go home?

01:02.730 --> 01:03.200
Home?

01:03.260 --> 01:04.200
With you.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.600
I don't like being here alone.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.200
You don't like
being alon either.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.500
They said draining the fluid
might not be enough--

01:11.560 --> 01:12.400
That more might build up,

01:12.630 --> 01:13.700
and if it does...

01:13.760 --> 01:19.130
then Kyle will suffer
permanent brain damage.

01:22.030 --> 01:26.530
MAN:
The time I lost is gone.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.100
ll never get it back.

01:28.160 --> 01:33.700
But my years in the dark
didn't kill me

01:34.100 --> 01:36.430
and my work remains.

01:40.060 --> 01:42.000
And even though
I might not understand

01:42.060 --> 01:43.160
what's happening to me,

01:43.230 --> 01:46.660
I have faith
in the final outcome.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.800
After all...

01:48.860 --> 01:52.000
I'm doing
what I was intended to do,

01:52.030 --> 01:54.000
becoming what
I was meant to be.

01:54.060 --> 01:56.330
I look forward to corresponding
with you again.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.800
I know it's been a long time.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.800
I tell you this
as a courtesy.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.230
You can observe my work,

02:05.300 --> 02:09.660
but there's no point
in ting to interfere with it.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.160
I'm now in full command
of my talents.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.160
I hope the world is ready.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.730
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security reses

02:22.100 --> 02:23.960
to divulge the names
or the whereabouts

02:24.100 --> 02:26.560
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.

02:26.630 --> 02:30.400
Confirmed reports
of unusual abilities

02:30.460 --> 02:31.660
have the public panicked,

02:31.730 --> 02:34.760
and yet this man
sitting beside me

02:34.830 --> 02:37.500
says we have nothing
to worry about.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.130
I'm sure most of you
still recognize him,

02:40.200 --> 02:44.100
even though he's been away
for the past 28 months.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.430
I'm talking about
Mr. Jordan Collier,

02:47.500 --> 02:48.830
who recently breached

02:48.900 --> 02:49.200
the government's
wall of silence

02:50.460 --> 02:54.500
and chose to out himself
as one of the notorious 4,400.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.230
Jordan...

02:58.300 --> 02:59.930
why?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.160
Why now, why here?

03:02.230 --> 03:03.160
What's your agenda?

03:03.300 --> 03:05.300
I have no agenda.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.030
But someone had to put
a human face on the 4,400.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.400
We have been demonized
enough by people like you.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.330
Well, if you're implying
this is a witch hunt,

03:14.400 --> 03:16.030
I disagree.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.560
You're not the one
being burned at the stake.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.760
Breakfast is ready.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.630
Shouldn't I be
saying that to you?

03:22.700 --> 03:24.230
( mutes audio )

03:29.630 --> 03:34.530
Maia, thank you
very much.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.700
This beats a can of Coke
and slice of cold pizza.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.060
And I promise,
I will get better

03:40.130 --> 03:42.500
at being the grownup
in this relationship.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.600
It's okay.

03:43.660 --> 03:46.000
I like bei the grownup.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.300
You know, I think

03:47.360 --> 03:49.400
you're going to have a good time
with Mrs. Banky

03:49.460 --> 03:52.000
'cause I hear
she's a very cool baby-sitter.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.230
Oh, and I talked to Mr. Ryland

03:55.300 --> 03:56.530
about getting permission
to get you enrolled in school

03:56.600 --> 03:57.230
because that
would be nice, right?

03:59.630 --> 04:01.300
Yeah.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.200
School might be fun.

04:04.630 --> 04:05.530
Diana...

04:05.600 --> 04:08.260
you're not going
to like what's in there.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.900
Oliver Knox disappeared
August 22, 1983,

04:26.960 --> 04:27.230
five nights
after the last

04:29.200 --> 04:31.060
of the eight
bodies turned up

04:31.130 --> 04:32.530
And he moved back
to Friday Harbor when?

04:32.600 --> 04:33.700
About three weeks ago.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.100
19 days before
the latest body turned up.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.500
You know, it could
be coincidence.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.530
And  the letter the guy
sent appears genuine,

04:40.600 --> 04:42.500
but this latest victim
wasn't a prostitute.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.960
The eight original ones were.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.160
Coincidence.

04:45.230 --> 04:46.800
That's  the kind
of positive thinking

04:46.860 --> 04:48.760
we like to encourage
in this department.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.860
Because if it is Knox,
then it means we've got

04:50.930 --> 04:53.700
a 4400 serial killer
on our hands,

04:53.760 --> 04:55.630
and if that's not
a worst-case scenario,

04:55.700 --> 04:57.400
it'll sure as hell do for one.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.860
It's the kind
of hot button issue

04:58.930 --> 05:00.700
that Barbara Yates
lives for.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.400
So I guess wre taking
a trip up to Friday Harbor.

05:03.460 --> 05:04.630
Bring me back a T-shirt.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.230
Alex...

05:06.300 --> 05:08.460
OFFICER:
National Threat
Assessment Command--

05:08.530 --> 05:11.460
NTAC. Are you here about Knox?

05:12.100 --> 05:12.630
Got it in one.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.030
It's a small town.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.960
Oliver reappeared
after 21 years in the wind

05:17.060 --> 05:18.760
and he dsn't look
a day older.

05:18.830 --> 05:21.300
We connected the dots.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.200
So you two going
to take over my
investigation?

05:24.260 --> 05:24.430
Let's just say
we'll be cooperating
wi your department

05:27.060 --> 05:29.600
until we've established
Knox's guilt or innocence.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.060
I could use
some fresh air...

05:31.130 --> 05:33.460
and some cooperation.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.900
His alibi's airtight.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.760
TOM:
Alibi or not,
we're still going

05:38.830 --> 05:39.930
to want to talk to him.

05:40.000 --> 05:40.400
Anything else
you can tell us?

05:43.030 --> 05:46.560
You want to know
about Knox?

05:46.630 --> 05:49.300
When he was 15, he was
bow hunting with his cousin.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.700
There was an accident.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.060
Knox ended up with
an arrow in his chest.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.660
ff
His cousin panicked and ran.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.530
Knox woke up lying
in a pool of blood

05:59.600 --> 06:01.360
with this arrow sticking
out of his chest.

06:01.630 --> 06:02.630
So l me guess.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.560
He pulled it out,
and he cauterized the wound?

06:04.630 --> 06:05.900
Even better.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.637
He stood up
and walked four miles into town.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.603
Strolled
into the emergency room

06:10.666 --> 06:12.730
and checked himself
in at the front desk.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.930
All this with
an arrow in his chest.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.300
Years later,

06:16.360 --> 06:18.100
I asked him if it
really happened that way.

06:18.160 --> 06:18.400
He said every
word was true.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.160
I told him that must
have been the walk from hell.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.760
"Not at all," he said.

06:25.830 --> 06:26.360
"It was exhilarating."

06:28.330 --> 06:31.160
He felt like he could
have walked forever.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.260
That's Oliver Knox.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.630
( vocalist sings mysterious
melody over pop beat )

06:48.700 --> 06:51.330
* So long ago *

06:51.400 --> 06:53.930
* Another life *

06:54.000 --> 06:58.060
* I can feel
your heartbeat *

06:58.130 --> 07:00.400
* It's not a dream *

07:00.460 --> 07:03.360
* Remember us *

07:03.430 --> 07:07.500
* I can see it in your eyes *

07:07.560 --> 07:10.760
* We'll find our place in time *

07:10.830 --> 07:16.730
* Our place in time
beyond the sun *

07:16.800 --> 07:20.200
* We'll find our place in time *

07:20.260 --> 07:25.260
* Our place in time
to call our own *

07:25.330 --> 07:25.500
( vocalist sings
mysterious melody )

07:39.800 --> 07:40.900
TOM:
Mr. Knox?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.430
Mr. Knox.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.900
We have a few
questions to ask you

07:43.960 --> 07:45.760
about the death
of Theresa Baron.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.100
Sheriff Conrad call you

07:47.160 --> 07:49.300
or did you jump
to the same conclusion he did?

07:49.360 --> 07:50.830
Not exactly a big jump.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.500
You were on the police
roll out back in '83.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.730
Along with a number
of other people.

07:56.800 --> 07:56.900
Did you know Ms. Baron?

08:00.500 --> 08:01.330
No.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.430
She was born after
I was abducted.

08:04.500 --> 08:10.560
Look, I know how tempting
the math is on this murder.

08:10.630 --> 08:13.530
I  disappear in '83,
the killings stop.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.430
Here I am
and the poor girl is dead.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.830
We noticed.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.230
And if were
in your shoes,

08:19.330 --> 08:20.900
you know, I'd probably
want me to be guilty too.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.130
It would be so convenient.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.900
But I almost feel bad
I can't oblige you.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.400
I did not kill that woman.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.260
Listen, can I get you
some water or something?

08:32.330 --> 08:33.429
I mean, if we're going to talk,

08:33.500 --> 08:36.360
we might as well be civilized
about it, right?

08:37.159 --> 08:37.400
No. No.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.460
We've taken up
enough of your time.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.559
Thanks.

08:40.630 --> 08:42.000
Conrad told me the story

08:42.360 --> 08:44.630
about how you got shot
in the chest that day.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.960
Jim does love to talk.

08:47.030 --> 08:48.430
Would you like
to see the arrow?

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
I have it inside.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.900
Th won't be necessary.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.600
How's Kyle?

08:59.660 --> 09:02.830
We don't know yet.

09:08.630 --> 09:11.400
Um, about last night.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.900
The kiss.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.030
That...

09:16.260 --> 09:18.400
and other things.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.930
We've  kind of got
a lot to talk about.

09:21.000 --> 09:21.530
No, we don't.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.100
Shawn.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.330
You have a gift.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.330
Nikki.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.360
When did you get here?

09:31.430 --> 09:31.700
How's Kyle?

09:32.500 --> 09:33.900
He's still in intensive care,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.600
but Uncle Tommy
says he's stable.

09:35.660 --> 09:39.030
I guess whatever they're doing
to him this whole time worked.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.300
For now, anyway.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.230
Listen, I'm starving.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.960
Yowant to come with us
to the cafeteria?

09:52.130 --> 09:55.530
Yeah, I'll bring you
a burrito.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.460
Why don't you start
with something easy.

10:03.530 --> 10:06.560
Tell me about your relationship
with your parents.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.400
My parents?

10:08.460 --> 10:10.560
They used to argue
about money a lot.

10:10.630 --> 10:13.230
That was before they split up.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.530
They divorced?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.700
Yeah, I was 14.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.000
Do you remember how
that made you feel?

10:19.630 --> 10:20.400
Depressed.

10:20.460 --> 10:24.130
I don't know. Angry, maybe.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.560
Why don't you tell me
about the rest of your family.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.600
They're gone.

10:30.660 --> 10:33.960
I've got a few cousins
outside of Saint Lis

10:34.030 --> 10:38.760
who  remember me as a picture
in an old photo album.

10:39.630 --> 10:41.500
Well, my husband
married another woman.

10:41.560 --> 10:41.660
My brother hates that I'm back.

10:49.030 --> 10:49.660
What's the point of this?

10:51.430 --> 10:51.630
Look... you want to help m

10:55.900 --> 10:58.500
Help me find a job.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.660
Tell me what to say
when they ask me how old I am...

11:01.730 --> 11:03.700
or about my work experience,

11:03.760 --> 11:07.360
or-or tell me how to explain
that 50-year gap in my resume.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.660
Everyone says that the world

11:08.730 --> 11:10.330
has-has-has changed
for the better,

11:10.400 --> 11:12.230
that people don't judge you
by the color of your skin.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.230
Well, let me tell you something:
I'm still being judged,

11:14.360 --> 11:15.660
and you're sitng there
asking me

11:15.730 --> 11:20.130
about my-my relationship
with my parents?

11:21.160 --> 11:23.660
Let's talk about this hostility

11:23.730 --> 11:25.360
that you're manifesting
towards me.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.830
Danny, you
wanted to see me?

11:31.900 --> 11:35.330
Thanks, Peter.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.830
So, this is where
you rk, huh?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.200
Yeah. What's up?

11:40.260 --> 11:42.860
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about something, Uncle Tommy.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.660
Is this about Shawn?

11:45.660 --> 11:48.500
How'd you know?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.430
( sighs ):
I'm listening.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.630
He, uh... he had
a fight at school
a few weeks ago.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.460
He might've
killed the guy if
I didn't step in.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.460
What'd he do to him?

11:59.530 --> 12:02.800
Well, it sounds crazy,
but... I don't know.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.300
It was like Shawn
was draining the life

12:05.360 --> 12:07.460
out of him somehow...

12:07.530 --> 12:10.960
and I'm not the
only one who saw it.

12:11.030 --> 12:15.630
What made you deci
to tell me now?

12:15.700 --> 12:19.200
Just thought
yoshould know.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.300
( birds chirping )

12:22.360 --> 12:22.830
( insects buzzing )

12:46.700 --> 12:48.700
Beautiful,
aren't they?

12:50.700 --> 12:51.500
I wonder if that's

12:51.560 --> 12:54.660
where we were.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.060
What's everybody doing here?

13:00.630 --> 13:01.830
Whatre you
doing here?

13:02.630 --> 13:04.230
I don't know.
I wanted to see it--

13:04.630 --> 13:07.130
where we came back.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.630
I figured it'd be a good place
to come and think,

13:09.700 --> 13:11.500
you know, clear my head.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.460
Most people come for
the conversation.

13:14.530 --> 13:16.800
Well, there's not
a lot of that going on.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.330
Oh, give it time.

13:18.400 --> 13:18.530
Around 11:00,
this place becomes

13:20.700 --> 13:24.160
one big group
therapy session.

13:25.230 --> 13:28.730
( car approaching )

13:37.660 --> 13:39.700
I'm sorry
to interrupt...

13:39.760 --> 13:43.700
but I just had
to see this myself.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.930
My name's Jordan Collier.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.960
Some of you may recognize me,

13:50.030 --> 13:52.630
and if you
do, you know

13:52.700 --> 13:56.030
I'm one of the 4400
just like you.

13:56.100 --> 14:00.100
I'm impressed
that you found each other,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.100
and I'm glad
that you've come

14:02.160 --> 14:04.430
in support of
each other.

14:04.500 --> 14:09.800
And, uh... I'm cold,

14:09.860 --> 14:12.860
and I have to guess
that you guys are
cold, too...

14:14.530 --> 14:16.160
...so I want to suggest
that we continue

14:16.230 --> 14:18.130
these get-togethers indoors.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.500
I have a place nearby.

14:19.560 --> 14:19.760
It's warm, it's spacious...

14:23.030 --> 14:25.300
anI wanto invite all of you

14:25.360 --> 14:25.700
to meet me there
next Thursday afternoon.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.300
You listen to the news.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.130
You read the paper.
You hear the talk.

14:34.200 --> 14:39.030
Seems like the entire world
is turning against us.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.660
Well, what are we going to do
about it?

14:41.730 --> 14:43.030
We going to give up?

14:43.060 --> 14:45.800
We going to run
and hide? Maybe.

14:48.030 --> 14:49.930
Or maybe... just maybe,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.260
we build a world of our own.

14:56.130 --> 14:59.860
This is the spot where we found
Theresa Baron's body.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.430
We went over everything
pretty good.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.260
Yeah, well,
we have the toys.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.760
We like to take 'em out of
the box every once in a while.

15:11.830 --> 15:14.700
The killer posed
her after she
was dead, right?

15:14.760 --> 15:15.800
There should've been

15:15.860 --> 15:17.960
blood, handprints
all over the place.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.630
It rained the day
we found the body.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.430
The whole scene
was washed clean.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.360
Yeah, but if he dragged her
over here, he had

15:23.430 --> 15:23.630
to grab onto
something.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.660
Tom.

15:38.500 --> 15:38.800
CONRAD:
I'll be damned.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.930
( tires squealing )

15:49.000 --> 15:50.760
His name is Philip Lopez.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.930
He did 18 years on an aggravated
rape conviction.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.260
He was paroled
six months ago.

15:54.330 --> 15:54.660
We just got confirmation.

15:55.530 --> 15:56.930
His prints were found
at the scene

15:57.000 --> 15:58.260
of Theresa Baron's murder.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.300
TOM:
All right.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.760
Everyone set?

16:02.830 --> 16:05.300
Go.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.060
Lopez!

16:10.830 --> 16:12.760
( grunting )

16:12.830 --> 16:14.900
( banging door )

16:17.160 --> 16:18.400
Tom.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.430
The suicide note says
he killed all nine women.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.600
He wrote that only
his "time away"

16:38.030 --> 16:39.100
kept him from doing more.

16:39.160 --> 16:39.530
Do the dates
make sense?

16:40.700 --> 16:43.630
Lopez was up here
working as seasonal labor

16:43.700 --> 16:44.100
during the first round
of killings.

16:46.860 --> 16:51.100
Guess we owe Oliver Knox
an apology.

17:02.130 --> 17:04.060
( man whistling eee tune )

17:04.130 --> 17:08.300
( shutter clicking )

17:19.230 --> 17:20.660
Excuse me.

17:20.730 --> 17:24.359
CaI get a cranbey
juice and seltzer?

17:24.430 --> 17:27.800
And, uh... give
me another of
what he's having.

17:27.859 --> 17:28.000
Vengo subito.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.800
Vuolo giaccho con quello?

17:33.030 --> 17:34.130
Excuse me?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.760
Sorry, I, uh...

17:35.900 --> 17:37.430
I'm going to Florence
in four days,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.200
and  I didn't want to seem
like a tourist

17:39.260 --> 17:40.260
when I get there
Oh.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.430
Ice?
Yeah, a little.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.600
I studd, uh,
Italian in college.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.060
Really?

17:47.130 --> 17:49.960
Tu sci bella...

17:50.030 --> 17:53.830
come il tramanto
di Duomo.

17:53.900 --> 17:58.560
"Beautiful as a sunset
over Duomo."

17:58.630 --> 18:01.300
That is very good.
You get an A-plus.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.960
And yoget a free round.

18:04.030 --> 18:06.930
Grazie.
Hey, Felicia,

18:07.000 --> 18:07.100
can I get a beer?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.630
Ne a refill, friend?

18:12.660 --> 18:14.130
Thanks.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.960
Listen, I, uh...

18:16.030 --> 18:18.130
I know we don't know
each other,

18:18.200 --> 18:20.200
but I have something
I want to show you.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.160
So, what's her name?

18:29.230 --> 18:32.100
I don't know, but...

18:32.160 --> 18:35.230
I can tell you something
about her.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.130
( whispering

18:51.400 --> 18:54.230
( whistling eerie tune )

19:04.930 --> 19:05.200
Hello? I'm so sorry I'm late.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.130
Oh, hey, Iris.
How did we do today?

19:12.200 --> 19:12.300
I can't come
back here.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.300
What? Why?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.060
That child.

19:17.130 --> 19:19.330
I'm sorry.
You'll find someone.

19:27.030 --> 19:29.660
I told her that we wouldn't
be seeing each other

19:29.730 --> 19:32.260
for a couple of weeks.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.260
Why... why did
you tell her that?

19:34.330 --> 19:37.830
'Cause she was
going to be called
for jury duty.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.760
She thought
I was kidding.

19:39.830 --> 19:44.000
A few hours later,
her husband called.

19:44.130 --> 19:48.860
And she got a summons
for jury duty?

19:49.830 --> 19:50.160
Wellhey, come here.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.430
It's okay, all right?
It's okay.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.200
( monitor beeping )

20:02.730 --> 20:03.730
What are you doing

20:03.800 --> 20:04.200
here so late?

20:05.430 --> 20:06.630
Well, mom said

20:06.700 --> 20:09.230
he was getting worse.

20:11.760 --> 20:14.900
Thfluid's building
inside his skull again.

20:14.960 --> 20:19.400
Why did they take me
d leave him like this?

20:19.460 --> 20:21.260
We were both on the beach
that night.

20:21.330 --> 20:22.860
I don't understand.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.560
I wish I could
remember something,

20:24.630 --> 20:26.530
'cause I keep
thinking...

20:26.600 --> 20:27.900
think it would help.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.200
Tom said that you were here
the night

20:30.200 --> 20:34.460
that Kyle had that jump
in his brain activity.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.760
And he was getting better,

20:36.830 --> 20:40.660
and now he's dying.

20:40.730 --> 20:44.260
Shawn, did you do something
to him?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.260
( gasping )

20:56.960 --> 20:59.300
Shawn, tell me.
Just talk to me and tell me...

20:59.360 --> 21:00.660
Aunt Linda, no, I
didn't do anything.
Please...

21:00.760 --> 21:04.900
I told Uncle Tommy, and
I'm telling you, oy?

21:04.960 --> 21:05.330
I got to go.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.230
( monitor beeping )

21:16.330 --> 21:18.530
I wish we could talk
to aoctor about it.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.530
And say what? "My baby
may be some kind of alien,

21:22.600 --> 21:25.230
and by the way,
I know what it's thinking"?

21:25.300 --> 21:26.360
Yeah, all that'll do

21:26.430 --> 21:28.700
is get me thrown
right back into quarantine.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.130
I was there today
to register our new address.

21:31.200 --> 21:31.360
Oh, thank you
for doing that.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.130
I can't stand
going back there.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.800
I ran into Gary Branskul.

21:36.860 --> 21:40.000
He had the bed
next to mine.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.800
He told me
about some get-together

21:41.860 --> 21:42.100
Jordan Collier's
throwing.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.500
Hey, Jordan Collier.
He's the-the hotel guy.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.800
Yeah. Turns out
he's one of us.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.360
LILY:
Yeah, we should go.

21:52.430 --> 21:55.160
( giggling ):
Richard, come on.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.330
You can't tell me
teenagers didn't
make out in 1951.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.330
Yeah, in a parked car
by the lake.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.330
Ohin a parked
car by the lake.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.460
That's very cute.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.500
( echoing, overlapping voices ):
Let me tell you something...

22:18.000 --> 22:21.460
( voices continue )

22:40.060 --> 22:41.730
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

22:41.800 --> 22:43.330
Are you crazy?

22:43.400 --> 22:43.500
Get out of the road!

22:49.800 --> 22:51.100
I killed them.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.760
I killed them all.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.230
I killed them all.

22:55.300 --> 22:55.530
Hands... hands up.

22:56.430 --> 22:58.530
Keep your hands up.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.200
CONRAD:
Her name was Gayle Keating.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.530
She worked at a
local video store.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.760
They found her body in
Frick Park this morning.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.600
Her blood was
all over him.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.200
He spoke
for five minutes straight

23:10.260 --> 23:11.660
when we first brought him in.

23:11.730 --> 23:14.600
Confessed to Gayle's death
and the other nine murders.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.900
Hasn't said
a word since.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.700
Philip Lopez
killed Theresa Baron.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.400
He said so in his suicide note.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.130
We found her shirt
in his apartment, his prints...

23:22.200 --> 23:25.200
I know, but this morning,
Charlie Staley confessed

23:25.260 --> 23:26.600
to the same murder.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.260
And they both claim to be behind
the original round of killings?

23:29.330 --> 23:31.300
Yeah, only Charlie's 39.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.300
He was five years old

23:33.360 --> 23:34.900
when the first death
happened.

23:35.260 --> 23:36.300
And we can
eliminate Lopez

23:36.360 --> 23:38.030
as a suspect in the original
murders as well.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.160
How do you fure that?

23:39.360 --> 23:40.760
checked Lopez's
prison records.

23:41.130 --> 23:41.900
He's left-handed.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.260
According to the
autopsy reports

23:43.330 --> 23:44.330
in the '80s,

23:44.400 --> 23:46.300
the Friday Harbor killer
was right-handed.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.200
So, Lopez kills one girl,
Staley kil the other,

23:49.400 --> 23:52.430
and neither one of them
committed the original crimes?

23:52.500 --> 23:54.260
Why would they confess
to murders

23:54.330 --> 23:56.530
they cldn't possibly
have committed?

24:00.660 --> 24:02.630
Pieces don't quite
fit together, do they?

24:02.700 --> 24:06.000
Until you add Knox
into the puzzle.

24:06.060 --> 24:07.730
He disappears,
the killings stop.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.500
He came back,
they started again.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.630
So, let's say

24:10.700 --> 24:12.400
Knox is involved
somehow.

24:12.460 --> 24:14.200
That means what,
he's...

24:14.260 --> 24:18.230
he's forcing these men
to do his murders for him?

24:18.300 --> 24:18.960
Could be.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.500
The question is how.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.500
I mean, why would he want
more than one person

24:22.560 --> 24:24.130
to admit to the original crimes?

24:24.200 --> 24:26.000
One confession,
we might stop digging,

24:26.060 --> 24:27.830
but two--
it just gets our attention.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.060
Well, maybe he can't control
everything they do.

24:31.130 --> 24:31.930
What if Knox
can force

24:32.000 --> 24:33.460
people to kill?

24:33.530 --> 24:35.160
But only
by convincing them

24:35.230 --> 24:38.300
that they really are
the Friday Harbor killers.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.100
In for one murder,
in for them all.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.200
( Collier chuckling )

24:46.360 --> 24:47.660
Good, good.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.360
Hi. Welcome.

24:50.430 --> 24:51.500
1969, huh?

24:51.560 --> 24:52.930
Well, the good news

24:53.000 --> 24:55.930
is your bell bottoms
are back in yle.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.300
( chuckling )

24:57.360 --> 24:59.860
Hi.

24:59.930 --> 25:03.230
So, there's this one guy--
I was just talking to him--

25:03.300 --> 25:05.030
and he was gone
for 40 years,

25:05.100 --> 25:06.330
and he came back

25:06.400 --> 25:08.660
and picked everything up
without missing a beat.

25:08.900 --> 25:09.960
And then there's me.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.760
I'm ne for three years,
and I come back,

25:11.830 --> 25:14.000
and it's like my whole life
has fallen apart,

25:14.200 --> 25:15.330
everything's different...

25:15.400 --> 25:17.960
I kn. Shawn, look,
the thing to remember

25:18.030 --> 25:20.800
is that most of us feel
the same way you do.

25:20.860 --> 25:23.600
Well, some of us are
more different than others,

25:24.430 --> 25:25.060
if you know what I mean.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.830
I'm not sure I do.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.860
Okay, I had this fight
with a guy at school,

25:29.930 --> 25:32.600
and I know it's going
to sound crazy...

25:32.660 --> 25:36.360
ff
I really can't hear
the specifics right now.

25:36.430 --> 25:37.730
Not yet, anyway.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.030
I have a lot
of interviews

25:39.300 --> 25:42.360
over the next few weeks,
and I have to be able to deny

25:42.430 --> 25:43.930
what I need to.

25:44.000 --> 25:44.500
Look, I, I know you're feeling
confused right now,

25:47.330 --> 25:49.060
and I
can't blame you.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.360
But it sounds to me
like you've been given a gift.

25:52.430 --> 25:55.030
That's, uh,
that's what Nikki called it.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.360
Well, Nikki's right,
whoever she is.

25:57.430 --> 26:00.300
And about this gift--
don't let  scare you.

26:00.530 --> 26:02.830
You will find
the right way to use it.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.560
Okay.

26:07.030 --> 26:10.800
Well, what can I do for you
this afternoon... ly, '93?

26:10.860 --> 26:12.830
Don't worry, it's not a line.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.460
Though I do have to say

26:14.530 --> 26:16.830
you're the most attractive
abductee

26:16.900 --> 26:18.460
I've met all afternoon.

26:18.530 --> 26:19.800
I'm Jordan Collier.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.530
I'm throwing this rty.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.000
Oh. Nice to meet you.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.060
( chuckling )

26:24.130 --> 26:25.900
RICHARD:
Here you go.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.000
Thank you.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.500
Do I detect a little
romance brewing

26:29.560 --> 26:30.530
among the 4400?

26:30.600 --> 26:32.660
( chuckling ):
You have a good eye.

26:32.730 --> 26:34.560
Well, I'm just
happy you two

26:34.630 --> 26:37.630
are getting something
positive out of all this.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.130
You're Jordan Collier?

26:39.200 --> 26:41.230
Yes. See, he's
not afraid of me.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.860
I, I'm a little lightheaded.

26:45.860 --> 26:46.430
It's hot.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.130
Yeah, I should sit down.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.730
Uh, why don't I
find you a seat, huh?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.400
I'll get you
some water.

26:52.460 --> 26:53.800
Thank you.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.360
Thank you.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.960
You want me

26:59.030 --> 27:00.730
to, uh, call a docto or...?

27:00.800 --> 27:02.260
No, m not sick.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.600
It'll pass.

27:03.660 --> 27:04.800
Here you go.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.100
COLLIER:
Well, that good.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.200
If you're not sick,
then what's, uh...?

27:09.260 --> 27:11.230
RICHARD:
It's just
morning sickness.

27:11.300 --> 27:11.730
You're pregnant.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.460
Uh... first trimester.

27:17.530 --> 27:17.730
Well, that explains it

27:19.660 --> 27:21.930
Congratulations to both of you.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
( chuckling )

27:24.060 --> 27:25.600
Did I say

27:25.660 --> 27:26.960
something wrong?

27:27.030 --> 27:28.660
I-It's a little
more complicated than that.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.800
Richard's
not the father.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.230
I-I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

27:35.530 --> 27:37.430
but I was when I got back.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.530
Strange, huh?

27:40.600 --> 27:43.630
Well, interesting
is more like it. Uh...

27:43.700 --> 27:45.460
Kind of makes
you wonder

27:45.530 --> 27:46.360
what the hell
they have in mind--

27:46.430 --> 27:48.430
whoever took
us, I mean.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.000
You haven't ld your counselor
about this, have you?

27:51.560 --> 27:53.460
We haven't told anyone.

27:53.530 --> 27:56.060
Well, I'd keep it that way
for now.

27:57.830 --> 28:00.030
Look, how are you guys managing?

28:00.100 --> 28:01.830
You have everything
you need?

28:01.900 --> 28:03.800
Yeah, everything except a job.

28:03.860 --> 28:05.800
I was a pilot in the Air Force.

28:05.860 --> 28:08.360
Supposed to be drawing
a pension, but...

28:08.430 --> 28:10.230
that hasn't come through yet.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.760
I've applied
for flight instructor jobs.

28:12.830 --> 28:13.560
I even filed a application
with Seattle P.D.

28:15.660 --> 28:18.860
But every time they find out
I'm one of the 4400...

28:18.930 --> 28:20.630
the job suddenly goes away.

28:20.700 --> 28:24.230
Well, look, I may have something
you'd be interested in.

28:24.300 --> 28:24.660
Doesn't involve flying,

28:25.900 --> 28:29.060
but given ur background
in the military, uh...

28:29.130 --> 28:33.630
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.660
Foundation?

28:34.730 --> 28:36.060
For the 4400.

28:36.130 --> 28:37.560
Anyway, if
you'renterested,

28:37.630 --> 28:39.800
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?

28:39.860 --> 28:41.560
( chuckling ):
I'll be there.

28:41.630 --> 28:42.700
Good.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.130
The rash of violence

28:44.200 --> 28:45.960
involving the 4400 continues,

28:46.030 --> 28:49.400
with sources telling us tonight
that Homeland Security

28:49.460 --> 28:51.760
is investigating
a possible connection

28:51.830 --> 28:53.830
between the Friday Harbor
murders

28:53.900 --> 28:55.630
and an undisclosed returnee.

28:55.700 --> 29:01.160
That hypocritical,
self-righteous,
irresponsible bitch.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.030
Oh, I-I take it
he doesn't like her show.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.160
He doesn't like her.

29:06.230 --> 29:07.630
When we were with the FBI,

29:07.700 --> 29:10.760
she disclosed the name of a
juror in a RICO prosecution.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.260
Judge declared a mistrial.

29:12.330 --> 29:14.200
Three years of work
down the drain.

29:14.260 --> 29:16.300
You know,
she blindsided me once.

29:16.360 --> 29:16.760
That is not going
to happen again.

29:18.730 --> 29:20.800
( phone ringing )

29:21.030 --> 29:22.700
Tom Baldwin.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.830
Yeah, sure.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.860
I see.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.460
We'll be there.

29:31.530 --> 29:33.100
That was Conrad.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.400
He got another letter.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.430
"I decide
who lives and who dies.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.700
My judgment is final,
and more verdicts are coming."

29:40.760 --> 29:43.400
The date's clipped from
this morning's paper.

29:43.460 --> 29:45.730
It couldn't have been composed
by Charlie Staley--

29:45.800 --> 29:46.030
not from jail.

29:47.430 --> 29:50.830
You telling us this letter's
from the Friday Harbor killer?

29:50.860 --> 29:52.800
It's genuine.

29:52.860 --> 29:55.230
He describes wound patterns
on the original victims.

29:55.300 --> 29:56.930
We kept that private.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.160
If you really believe
Knox is involved in this,

30:00.760 --> 30:01.630
why the hell is he out
there walking around?

30:01.760 --> 30:02.760
Let's pick him up right now.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.630
We can't do that.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.500
The bottom line is
we need to know exactly

30:06.730 --> 30:08.600
how he's connected
to these murders

30:08.660 --> 30:09.330
before we
can bring him in.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.600
So, what do we do--

30:10.660 --> 30:11.860
wait for
another girl

30:11.930 --> 30:12.200
to turn up dead?

30:13.200 --> 30:16.630
I think
we can do better than that.

30:23.930 --> 30:26.260
That's $27.75--
your change.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.800
Thank you.

30:29.530 --> 30:29.830
Who's this?

30:30.630 --> 30:31.760
Let me tell you

30:31.830 --> 30:32.860
something about her.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.330
Her name's Felicia

30:34.400 --> 30:35.930
( quietly ):
and she works over
at the bar...

30:36.000 --> 30:38.600
( continues speaking quietly )

30:43.200 --> 30:45.370
W or maybe a tax audit,lling
but I didn't think I'd merit

30:45.430 --> 30:47.300
an invitation
into the belly of the beast.

30:47.370 --> 30:50.200
Consider it a tribute to
the size of your bully pulpit.

30:50.270 --> 30:51.370
I'm flattered.

30:51.430 --> 30:52.470
Don't be.

30:52.530 --> 30:54.770
DC is calling
for your head.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.870
I want you to dial back
on the 4400.

30:58.130 --> 30:59.270
Not going to happen.

30:59.330 --> 31:01.070
I'm a journalist;
I answer only to my viewers.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.400
Don't you hide behind
freedom of the press.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.830
What you do isn't journalism;

31:04.900 --> 31:07.400
it's shouting "fire"
in a crowded theater,

31:07.470 --> 31:08.330
and you're going to stop

31:08.400 --> 31:10.200
before the stampede
begins.

31:10.270 --> 31:12.300
( quietly ):
Yeah.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.700
You have
a really strong face.

31:13.770 --> 31:14.030
Seriously, Dennis,
you should come on my show.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.400
You're getting in the way
of my job, Barbara.

31:19.470 --> 31:20.900
And if you're going to continue
interfering

31:20.970 --> 31:22.430
with Department of Homeland
Security,

31:22.500 --> 31:23.830
I'd advise you to tread lightly.

31:23.900 --> 31:27.400
And what are you going to do,
disappear me?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.770
I asked for your cooperation.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.130
And I've chosen not to give it.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.370
Fair enough.

31:33.430 --> 31:35.500
Don't forget to get
your parking

31:35.570 --> 31:38.230
validated
on the way out.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.770
This healthcare plan is
incredible.

31:43.370 --> 31:45.100
Yeah, well,
the maternity coverage

31:45.170 --> 31:45.400
should provide
for all yo doctors' visits

31:47.700 --> 31:49.930
and hospital care
once the baby's born.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.930
Mr. Collier, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.870
Say you'll take the job?

31:55.370 --> 31:57.000
( chuckles softly )

31:57.070 --> 31:57.300
( cell phone rings )

31:58.430 --> 32:01.270
I'm sorry.ne moment;
I have to take this.

32:01.330 --> 32:02.570
Yeah, Len.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.800
Oh, good, good.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.870
The whole property?

32:07.400 --> 32:09.300
Excellent. 26 million.

32:09.370 --> 32:12.200
Yes, I want you tolose.

32:12.270 --> 32:14.970
Well, don't worry about
the board of directors, Len.

32:15.030 --> 32:15.570
They voted me back in as CEO
when I returned, didn't they?

32:19.200 --> 32:19.430
I will handle them.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.530
Call me when
it's done. Okay.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.000
( phone beeps off )

32:24.070 --> 32:27.630
Real estate deals-- they're
never over till they're over.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.500
So are you going to come
to work for me or not?

32:33.900 --> 32:36.530
I can start tomorrow.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.270
Mr. Ryland--
Phil Gibson.

32:44.330 --> 32:44.570
This is an honor.

32:45.670 --> 32:46.930
Uh, Barbara will be
very disappointed

32:47.000 --> 32:48.430
she wasn't able to
meet with you herself.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.430
Actually,
I prefer to speak to you.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.300
Great. First, just let me
say right off the top, sir,

32:53.370 --> 32:56.130
that any information that
you give us about the 4400

32:56.200 --> 32:57.930
will never be
traced back to you.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.370
I'm glad to hear that

32:59.430 --> 33:01.370
because I have something
very important to pass on.

33:01.430 --> 33:03.030
Great. Do you mind
if I tape this, sir?

33:03.100 --> 33:03.200
Quick and simple.

33:04.770 --> 33:05.200
I want Barbara Yates's
coverage of the 4400 to stop.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.900
What do you mean "stop"?

33:09.970 --> 33:11.230
I mean it ends.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.070
She stops
covering the story, period.

33:14.130 --> 33:16.130
Uh, listen, uh, Mr. Ryland,

33:16.200 --> 33:20.230
Barbara has sole ahority
over her editorial content.

33:20.300 --> 33:20.600
It's Barbara. Barbara
says what Barbara wants.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.070
There's nothing I
can do about it.

33:24.130 --> 33:24.530
You're her producer--
produce.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.870
I don't think you
know what it's like

33:30.000 --> 33:31.930
to work in this
business theseays.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.030
We're not
Walter Cronkite here.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.670
You want to talk
about the old days?

33:36.730 --> 33:36.970
In the old days,
I would need a warrant

33:40.070 --> 33:43.070
to tap all your phones,

33:43.130 --> 33:45.200
to freeze all your assets,

33:45.270 --> 33:47.970
and to prevent you
from ever being a passenger

33:48.670 --> 33:50.970
on any airline in the world.

33:51.030 --> 33:54.770
But like you say,
it's not the old days anymore.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.270
Now you've worked
for Barbara Yates

33:56.670 --> 33:57.870
for a long time,
since the beginning,

33:57.930 --> 34:01.230
and I'm guessing that you know
where the bodies are buried.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.930
Draw me a map.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.300
( Kyle laughs )

34:17.370 --> 34:19.699
KYLE ( voice-over ):
You're just afraid
my dad will kick yr ass

34:20.600 --> 34:21.570
if I come home
smelling like beer.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.500
Evil cousin Shawn.

34:24.570 --> 34:26.570
Corrupter of the innocent.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.570
( whooshing overhead )

34:31.699 --> 34:35.000
( screaming in pain )

34:35.070 --> 34:37.500
( gasping )

34:37.570 --> 34:38.330
Help!

34:38.400 --> 34:38.500
Help me, Shawn! Shawn, help me!

34:39.870 --> 34:41.830
( screams )

34:41.900 --> 34:44.330
( Shawn screams in pain )

34:44.400 --> 34:47.929
( screams, grunts )

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
( screaming abruptly stops )

34:53.230 --> 34:56.030
( gasps ):
Oh, my God.

35:05.030 --> 35:05.670
Excuse me.

35:07.430 --> 35:07.670
I-I lost my dog.

35:08.330 --> 35:09.900
Could you help me find him?

35:09.970 --> 35:11.270
I haven't seen him.

35:11.630 --> 35:13.270
He's a-a wirehaired terrier.

35:13.630 --> 35:14.570
His name's Boss.

35:14.630 --> 35:16.770
I haven't seen him.
Could you let me by?

35:17.630 --> 35:19.600
This isn't funny.

35:20.130 --> 35:21.330
I'll scream.

35:21.670 --> 35:23.100
Yes, you will.

35:23.170 --> 35:24.170
( screams )

35:24.230 --> 35:25.370
Don't move!

35:25.670 --> 35:26.830
( grunting )

35:26.900 --> 35:28.370
MAN:
Felicia has to die!

35:28.430 --> 35:30.970
She has to!

35:31.030 --> 35:33.470
( man grunting )

35:36.570 --> 35:40.600
TOM:
This man, what did he say
to you, Mr. Mitchell?

35:41.630 --> 35:44.000
You've been following me?

35:44.070 --> 35:46.800
No. Actually,
we were following Knox.

35:46.870 --> 35:49.830
You know, I really like
the composition of this shot.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.270
It's nice cozy symmetry.

35:52.870 --> 35:54.900
Now, what did he say to you?

36:01.200 --> 36:01.600
You keep at him.

36:03.730 --> 36:06.000
We'll bring in Knox,
sit him down next to his friend.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.300
See what they have
to say to each other.

36:17.530 --> 36:17.770
Knox! Open up!

36:19.730 --> 36:21.700
Tom!

36:29.730 --> 36:31.670
Knox!

36:48.770 --> 36:52.700
( garbled police radio
transmission )

36:59.170 --> 37:02.730
( garbled radio transmission )

37:17.670 --> 37:21.270
( garbd radio transmission )

37:25.700 --> 37:27.970
Tell me the police have someone
at the girl's house.

37:28.630 --> 37:29.530
She refused an escort.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.170
She's leaving for Italy
in the morning.

37:34.130 --> 37:36.800
( phone ringing )

37:40.400 --> 37:42.730
Hello?

37:43.400 --> 37:46.300
Hello?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.000
( gasps )
Excuse me.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.170
I-I lost my dog.

37:50.230 --> 37:51.500
Can you help me find him?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.670
He's a wirehaired terrier.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.000
His name's Boss.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.230
( laughs )

37:58.200 --> 37:59.900
( panting )

38:00.730 --> 38:03.000
( grunts )

38:03.070 --> 38:05.470
( panicked panting )

38:05.530 --> 38:06.670
( grunts )

38:06.730 --> 38:09.300
( panicked panting )

38:09.370 --> 38:12.870
( panting, screams )

38:12.930 --> 38:14.870
Somebody, help me!

38:14.930 --> 38:16.800
( rens wailing )

38:16.870 --> 38:18.300
Stay back!

38:18.830 --> 38:20.130
Let her go! Let her go, Knox!

38:20.830 --> 38:22.200
Knox, get away from her,

38:22.830 --> 38:24.800
or I'll shoot!

38:27.170 --> 38:28.630
( crying )

38:28.770 --> 38:31.100
( panicked cries )

38:36.670 --> 38:38.300
( grunts in pain )

38:38.700 --> 38:39.930
I think you bre my nose.

38:40.470 --> 38:41.200
Stay down!

38:41.270 --> 38:42.300
Hey, you got me all wrong.

38:42.370 --> 38:42.730
Let me tell you a story...

38:43.430 --> 38:44.330
Not a word. Not a word.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.670
Not a word.

38:46.730 --> 38:48.500
TOM:
...damn serial killer.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.200
This guy murders eight people
before he's abducted.

38:51.270 --> 38:52.670
They send him back,

38:52.730 --> 38:54.570
d he picks up
right where he left off.

38:54.630 --> 38:58.500
In '83, Knox was your
garden-variety psychopath.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.000
They sent him back enhanced.

39:00.230 --> 39:01.500
Big difference.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.500
Well, it makes whoever took
him sound pretty nasty.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.170
They also
sent back Shawn.

39:05.230 --> 39:05.830
And Maia.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.830
Yes, I know, Tom.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.500
And for that,
I'd like to thank them.

39:09.570 --> 39:09.830
But it all seems
so random.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.530
Maybe.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.570
Until you start to look
at the bigger picture.

39:14.630 --> 39:17.000
Orson Bailey kills
Adam Kensington.

39:17.070 --> 39:19.370
Revenge murder--
open-and-shut.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.570
Carl Morrisey is
a well-intentioned,

39:21.630 --> 39:21.870
but hapless vigilante
o ends up dead.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.670
Like I said, random.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.030
Yeah, but we know that
Adam Kensington's company

39:28.100 --> 39:30.370
was perpetrating a massive
fraud on the public.

39:30.430 --> 39:33.670
And now we've learned,
since Carl Morrisey's death,

39:33.830 --> 39:35.530
his neighbors
have formed a watch committee

39:35.600 --> 39:35.870
that's helping
to protect Bradley Park.

39:37.330 --> 39:39.870
Anyone starting
to see a pattern?

39:39.930 --> 39:43.100
What, you're talking about
some kind of ripple effect?

39:43.170 --> 39:46.830
Diana Skouris
to the head of the class.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.300
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.

39:49.370 --> 39:51.100
But positive change
in these two cases.

39:51.170 --> 39:52.400
Wait a minute. What?!

39:52.470 --> 39:53.930
Who-whoever sent them back,

39:54.000 --> 39:54.170
you're saying they planned
for these changes to take place?

39:56.970 --> 39:58.130
What about
the Knox killings?

39:58.200 --> 39:59.530
There's nothing
positive there.

39:59.870 --> 40:02.170
Or maybe
we have seen the ripples yet.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.170
Excuse me.

40:12.230 --> 40:16.730
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you.

40:23.970 --> 40:28.300
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you!

40:28.370 --> 40:31.830
( no audio )

40:33.830 --> 40:35.000
( no audio )

40:44.130 --> 40:46.400
NEWSWOMAN ( on TV ):
Police aren't saying

40:46.470 --> 40:49.600
who is behind the release
of this closely guarded secret.

40:49.730 --> 40:51.600
A doment containing the names

40:51.670 --> 40:53.970
and the current addresses
of all the 4400

40:54.030 --> 40:55.770
has appeared on the Internet,

40:55.830 --> 40:58.200
and is now posted
on more than 20 sites.

40:58.270 --> 41:00.530
Authorities
aren't confirming the leak,

41:00.600 --> 41:02.970
butheir efforts
to shut down the sites

41:03.030 --> 41:04.430
with an emergency injunction

41:04.500 --> 41:06.430
suggest the list is genuine.

41:06.500 --> 41:12.070
We will have more on this
breaking story as it develops.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.500
machine beeps rhythmically )

41:22.570 --> 41:23.130
What are you doing here, Shawn?

41:33.130 --> 41:35.630
Kyle?

41:38.270 --> 41:41.130
( raspy, strained ):
How long...

41:43.070 --> 41:43.170
...have I been in the dark?

41:47.130 --> 41:50.430
( crying )
