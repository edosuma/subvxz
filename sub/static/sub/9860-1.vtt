01:51.978 --> 01:58.657
"I have got the treasure of love."

01:58.751 --> 02:05.930
"I have got the treasure of love."

02:06.459 --> 02:13.069
"My guru gave me
this invaluable gift."

02:13.166 --> 02:17.205
"I accepted it gratefully."

02:17.303 --> 02:24.016
"I have got the treasure of love."

02:24.110 --> 02:31.528
"I have got the treasure of love."

02:44.998 --> 02:46.375
Here you go son of Dashrath...

02:46.432 --> 02:48.378
take your bow.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.115
Chaubey sir,
a humble request...

02:55.275 --> 02:57.277
kindly give me a new bow.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.550
This breaks
when I pull it...

02:59.646 --> 03:01.523
then I've to stop the play
and glue it.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.161
Who told you to pull it like
Lord Rama?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.092
Adjust!

03:05.151 --> 03:06.994
Help boss!

03:07.187 --> 03:08.962
These shoes
are tight!

03:09.055 --> 03:10.398
The nails hurt!

03:10.557 --> 03:14.027
Instead of laughing in the
scene they make me cry!

03:14.127 --> 03:17.939
<i>The aunt who ﬂayed
Raven behave you...</i>

03:18.231 --> 03:21.075
had a smaller shoe size.
So what can I do?

03:21.167 --> 03:22.874
Inflation is on a rise.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.449
If I had bought new shoes for you
I couldn't have afforded food...

03:25.505 --> 03:27.815
and we would've had
to eat your shoes for dinner.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.717
You also adjust!

03:29.976 --> 03:32.115
Once Prem Dilwala...

03:32.212 --> 03:35.489
finds out about
all this...

03:35.548 --> 03:38.461
he will "adjust" boss!

03:39.852 --> 03:41.160
We'll begin our play...

03:41.221 --> 03:43.497
with the scene where...

03:43.890 --> 03:48.999
Sita is picking
flowers in the garden!

04:15.488 --> 04:19.630
Let's have some rocking songs!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.311
Brother.

04:32.805 --> 04:35.149
Glory to Lord Rama!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.653
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

04:37.710 --> 04:40.190
Glory to all the saints!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.487
Glory to all the devotees!

04:42.548 --> 04:45.859
Glory to Lord Rama!

04:46.185 --> 04:47.755
Some use their hands well...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.101
while some use their feet.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.533
But I use both well!

04:55.028 --> 04:56.405
Where are you going?

04:56.829 --> 05:00.606
Who narrates Rama's story here?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.144
You, Mr. Prem.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.037
Me...

05:04.437 --> 05:09.716
and what do I do before
I start narrating?

05:10.009 --> 05:12.580
You make a grand entry.

05:12.812 --> 05:20.253
And right before my entry you
were misbehaving, that too with Sita!

05:20.486 --> 05:21.897
Sorry my mistake.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.456
Pardon me Lord...

05:23.523 --> 05:29.963
but if anyone tries to
disrupt your beautiful tale...

05:30.363 --> 05:34.812
it makes your devotee very angry!

05:38.738 --> 05:40.547
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

06:01.994 --> 06:05.373
"Let there be an uproar
that shocks the neighbor."

06:05.431 --> 06:08.844
"Let us glorify compassion."

06:15.475 --> 06:18.922
"A story of Rama and Sita
and propriety and modesty."

06:19.011 --> 06:22.288
"Teaching the way of love."

06:22.615 --> 06:25.994
"The girl and the guy
will both learn."

06:29.422 --> 06:32.665
"The girl and the guy
will both learn.."

06:32.759 --> 06:35.262
"Ram and Sita's unique.."

06:36.062 --> 06:43.105
<i>"..love story."</i>

06:44.570 --> 06:47.642
We next move on to King Janak's court...

06:47.907 --> 06:51.081
where Lord Rama
is sitting with a smile.

06:51.144 --> 06:55.320
Ravan is proudly...
staring at the bow!

06:55.381 --> 06:59.295
And then he arrogantly steps forward!

07:12.698 --> 07:18.239
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

07:19.305 --> 07:22.878
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

07:22.942 --> 07:26.253
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

07:26.345 --> 07:29.349
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

07:29.449 --> 07:32.828
"Be ashamed of your deeds."

07:32.885 --> 07:36.458
"Ravan, you better
leave this place."

07:36.522 --> 07:40.265
"Why are you angry?"

07:43.262 --> 07:46.436
"Why are you angry?"

07:46.499 --> 07:49.969
"Ram and Sita's unique.."

07:50.036 --> 07:56.453
<i>“..love story.“</i>

08:03.549 --> 08:08.999
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

08:10.156 --> 08:13.694
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

08:13.759 --> 08:17.070
"Love is easy to get."

08:17.163 --> 08:20.167
"Love is easy to get."

08:20.233 --> 08:23.578
"Listen Chotu, Bhappu,
Raju, Gopal, and Gappu..."

08:23.669 --> 08:27.207
"you too will meet
the princess of your dreams."

08:27.273 --> 08:30.652
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

08:33.980 --> 08:37.222
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

08:38.918 --> 08:40.828
"Don't you see it?"

08:40.886 --> 08:47.532
"It's a love story."

08:58.304 --> 09:04.846
Prem Bhaiya (BROTHER),
I still can't understand why you...

09:05.044 --> 09:07.718
Our town's unrecognized actor...

09:07.847 --> 09:09.656
why are you still
talking like a woman?

09:09.782 --> 09:11.693
You're not playing Sita anymore.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.328
You make me so angry!

09:14.420 --> 09:16.093
What is it about Uphaar Foundation...

09:16.188 --> 09:18.964
that once again you're
donating all your earnings to it?

09:19.125 --> 09:21.366
Uphaar Foundation is run by....

09:21.694 --> 09:24.903
Princess Maithili of Devgarh.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.255
Ma'am, I know that the
Princess is in Delhi these days.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.390
She has a big fashion boutique there.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.361
Very good!

10:57.423 --> 11:00.097
But when is she coming back?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.866
She was here last year...

11:01.961 --> 11:05.499
on Sunday,
20th September at 3:30pm.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.874
She came in her flying chariot.
I remember.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.380
I don't know when
she's coming here next.

11:11.437 --> 11:14.611
But next week, she's
coming to Pritampur!

11:15.508 --> 11:16.714
Pritampur!

11:17.109 --> 11:21.319
It's only a day's journey from here.

11:21.881 --> 11:25.351
The Princess is engaged to
Vijay Singh, the Prince of Pritampur.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.954
And next week is
the Prince's coronation...

11:28.020 --> 11:29.966
she will definitely
attend that!

11:30.690 --> 11:33.796
Why don't you meet her there?

11:34.593 --> 11:36.595
She won't meet me.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.331
Of course she will.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.876
And when you do meet her....

11:39.965 --> 11:42.912
give your donation
box to her personally.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.743
She'll be really happy.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.713
Okay.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.052
Why don't you come along too?
For moral support!

11:49.108 --> 11:51.054
I won't go.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.520
I won't...

11:52.578 --> 11:54.785
Who's even asking you?

11:54.880 --> 11:58.225
You're my compulsory companion!

11:58.384 --> 12:01.456
Let's Pritampur... rrrrrrr!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.837
Your Highness,
the estate of Pritampur...

12:16.902 --> 12:22.250
that you'll be inheriting from
the Late King, it's rather expensive.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.753
I've heard it's worth billions.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.455
Should I put it at...

12:26.846 --> 12:28.154
let me not give it a figure.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.385
It's wow!

12:30.049 --> 12:31.323
How do you feel?

12:32.351 --> 12:33.921
I feel blessed.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.897
Your Prime Minister,
Deewan Saheb, was saying that...

12:35.955 --> 12:39.334
guests from all over the world
will be attending your coronation.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.803
The entire estate will be decorated...

12:41.861 --> 12:45.434
and you'll be crowned
with pomp and show.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.068
By the way, in today's times....

12:48.134 --> 12:51.081
"silly" is not the word, but...
I do find it funny.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.480
What do you say?

12:55.074 --> 12:57.281
You think traditions are funny?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.552
No, I...

12:59.712 --> 13:01.749
Is this clown here to waste my time?

13:02.014 --> 13:02.958
Sir.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.523
Excuse me!

13:06.919 --> 13:08.660
Following our traditions...

13:08.721 --> 13:11.497
is more important to
me than being the King.

13:11.557 --> 13:12.399
Next.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.368
So on that day we'll
see you in royal attire...

13:15.594 --> 13:21.237
armed with the royal sword, riding
an elephant amongst an army of horses?

13:21.700 --> 13:22.644
Yes.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.079
That day no one in
Pritampur will need to cook.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.042
Every resident...

13:26.105 --> 13:29.552
Every resident will be a royal guest.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.281
We'll decorate this
palace like a bride.

13:32.344 --> 13:33.789
<i>There“ be ﬁreworks.</i>

13:34.180 --> 13:36.456
Everyone will be chanting one thing...

13:36.515 --> 13:38.517
"Glory to King Vijay Singh!"

13:38.584 --> 13:41.394
Not Vijay Singh... "Glory to Pritampur!"

13:41.620 --> 13:43.429
Get my fencing gear
ready for tomorrow.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.896
That was close Ajay.
Very good!

14:30.569 --> 14:33.311
- Ow, Bhaisaheb (ELDER BROTHER)...
- Bhaisaheb wins!

14:40.346 --> 14:41.950
Happy Holi!

14:43.515 --> 14:44.858
You rascal...

14:46.752 --> 14:47.958
Bhaisaheb... no!

14:54.960 --> 14:57.338
Well done Princes!

15:03.202 --> 15:03.942
No!

15:04.169 --> 15:04.772
Yes.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.443
No, no... no is good, sir. No is fine.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.914
You guys were brilliant.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.682
Yes!

15:17.016 --> 15:18.222
Thank God sir...

15:18.284 --> 15:21.094
Thank God this wasn't a
real competition between you two...

15:21.153 --> 15:22.996
and just a practice.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.162
Thank you.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.963
Sir, this friendly match...

15:26.058 --> 15:27.401
will greatly entertain...

15:27.493 --> 15:30.565
the guests at the coronation.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.972
- What do you say?
- Not bad.

15:32.031 --> 15:35.069
Your Highness, Princess Maithili
has sent her confirmation.

15:35.167 --> 15:38.011
She'll be arriving in Pritampur
on Friday by the 2 o'clock train.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.914
We'll have to make
security arrangements.

15:41.006 --> 15:44.078
Who will be going
to the station to receive her?

15:44.710 --> 15:46.053
Bhaisaheb first.

15:46.111 --> 15:50.651
Bhaisaheb, I'm going to organize
a bouquet of 1,000 red roses.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.456
Please... take it with a smile.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.490
Tell him.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.963
Superb sir.

15:55.020 --> 15:55.998
Thank you.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.795
I think I'll avoid it.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.767
Because when people see us together...

15:59.825 --> 16:01.429
they start blessing us oddly.

16:01.527 --> 16:06.499
Your Highness, as per tradition...

16:06.765 --> 16:10.372
your sisters should
go to receive the Princess.

16:23.115 --> 16:27.393
After mom passed away,
whenever I missed her as a child...

16:27.720 --> 16:29.324
father used to say...

16:29.388 --> 16:32.926
'You're not alone Vijay,
you have two more mothers...'

16:32.992 --> 16:34.062
'...Ajay's mother..'

16:34.226 --> 16:36.035
'...Chandrika and Radhika's mother.'

16:36.128 --> 16:39.837
'You're very fortunate
to have such a big family.'

16:39.932 --> 16:41.434
Fortunate?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.572
We're all living separately,
aloof from each other.

16:44.636 --> 16:47.549
Because of our common activities,
I sometimes speak to Ajay.

16:47.639 --> 16:48.811
But my sisters...

16:49.108 --> 16:51.554
I wonder what they have against me.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.487
The King wanted you
to keep the family united.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.082
I did what I could...

16:56.148 --> 17:00.255
but if my sisters don't respond,
then I can't go any further!

17:06.657 --> 17:09.263
When family members fall apart...

17:09.461 --> 17:12.499
it takes almost a lifetime
to bring them together.

17:12.731 --> 17:15.644
But should we stop trying?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.881
Let's try again.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.886
I'll inform Chandrika and Radhika...

17:29.948 --> 17:32.929
that the Prince is
coming to meet them tomorrow.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.494
We'll go in the same royal carriage...

17:36.555 --> 17:40.435
in which you played
together as children.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.933
We'll request them...

17:43.028 --> 17:47.374
to receive their would-be
sister-in-law at the station.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.901
Have a seat, I'll call her.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.535
Chandrika!

18:24.570 --> 18:25.742
Chandrika!

18:54.233 --> 18:56.873
- Greetings.
- Mr. Bhandari, you? Here?

18:57.669 --> 19:00.206
Princess Chandrika called me.

19:00.405 --> 19:06.822
As the royal family's lawyer she wants
me to understand why you're here...

19:06.979 --> 19:08.617
..and then she'll meet you.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.257
She'll meet you...

19:15.754 --> 19:17.529
It's not what you think Mr. Bhandari.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.264
A brother's here to
meet his younger sisters.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.597
It's a bit personal.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.898
I'll meet her myself.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.242
Chandrika.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.977
Whatever we discuss will
be in front of the lawyer.

19:32.171 --> 19:32.945
Chanda!

19:33.472 --> 19:34.382
Enough!

19:43.649 --> 19:44.525
Your Highness!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.724
Chandrika! Chandri...

19:47.085 --> 19:47.790
Your Highness!

19:49.454 --> 19:50.990
Chuttan, let's go!

20:06.838 --> 20:10.479
I went there as per your advice
Deewan Saheb, and that was my mistake.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.455
If this is what family's like,
then every one's better-off alone!

21:54.179 --> 21:54.884
Chuttan!

23:32.477 --> 23:34.354
We've arrived in Pritampur!

23:34.446 --> 23:36.289
No we haven't reached Pritampur yet...

23:36.348 --> 23:38.954
there's a 30 minute halt
to eat food or use the washroom.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.357
- 30 minutes?
- Go on! Get it over with.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.157
Sit.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.130
- Does anyone want to use the washroom?
- No!

23:43.221 --> 23:46.498
No, right?
Driver, let's be on our way... quickly.

23:46.625 --> 23:47.865
What's the hurry?

23:47.959 --> 23:49.438
Will you find your bride there?

23:49.661 --> 23:53.507
Not a bride, a Goddess...
to whom he'll make an offering.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.544
Taunting tone but the right answer.

23:55.767 --> 23:59.476
Son, won't you buy fruits
and flowers to honour the Goddess?

24:03.375 --> 24:07.619
"My heart beats fast."

24:08.847 --> 24:12.590
"My heart is racing."

24:26.331 --> 24:31.906
"I have to meet her today."

24:31.970 --> 24:37.215
"I have to meet her today."

24:37.275 --> 24:42.918
"Let me take a gift for her.
Let me thank her."

24:42.981 --> 24:48.727
"Let me take snacks and sweets."

24:49.054 --> 24:54.561
"I have to meet her today."

24:54.626 --> 25:00.076
"I have to meet her today."

25:29.294 --> 25:32.332
So many medicines?
Is someone really unwell?

25:33.231 --> 25:34.107
Yes.

25:45.777 --> 25:51.591
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

25:51.650 --> 25:57.259
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

26:00.025 --> 26:05.771
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

26:05.830 --> 26:11.781
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

26:14.039 --> 26:19.580
"Let me buy various
kinds of snacks."

26:19.644 --> 26:25.287
"Something spicy and
something bitter and sour."

26:25.717 --> 26:31.326
"I have to meet her today."

26:31.423 --> 26:36.771
"I have to meet her today."

26:42.767 --> 26:46.681
"My heart beats fast."

26:48.139 --> 26:51.814
"My heart is racing."

26:54.245 --> 26:58.318
"My heart beats fast."

26:59.784 --> 27:02.390
Only one watermelon for the Princess?

27:02.887 --> 27:05.424
Is someone else also buying
the entire market like us?

27:05.624 --> 27:10.698
Yes... the rest of the watermelons
have been bought by that gentleman...

27:11.062 --> 27:15.909
he's the head security officer
of the Pritampur royal family.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.652
No I don't want anything.

27:44.796 --> 27:45.570
Thank you sir.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.405
Have some guava, really sweet.

27:49.234 --> 27:53.649
Sorry sir. I didn't have
any other way to impress you.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.384
Please, arrange a small
meeting with the Princess.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.312
We've come from really far...

27:59.411 --> 28:03.291
facing many difficulties
to meet Princess Maithili.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.992
Sir, just a brief meeting.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.430
Yes, of course.
I'll arrange a meeting for you.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.600
We Pritampur dwellers
take good care of our guests.

28:13.825 --> 28:14.530
Come.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.803
In the car?

28:16.327 --> 28:18.364
I'll get our luggage...

28:25.370 --> 28:27.407
Bhaiji (SIR)...
I love you, Bhaiji!

28:27.772 --> 28:30.218
Even Kanhaiya has
never loved me so much.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.082
So Bhaiji what can we show you?

28:33.611 --> 28:35.784
The plays of Chota Bheem,
Bal Hanuman...

28:35.947 --> 28:37.984
or the Ladies' Special...
Jai Santoshi Maa!

28:38.316 --> 28:41.320
- No... do you have a CD or something?
- Yes, of course.

28:41.419 --> 28:42.693
- We do have a CD.
- We do have a CD.

28:43.354 --> 28:46.927
We'll show him the
best one... how about this?

28:47.025 --> 28:49.528
No... I had a viral during
the performance.

28:49.661 --> 28:53.473
This is our interpretation
of Vrindavan's 'Raas-Leela' for you.

28:53.531 --> 28:54.839
I'm not interested.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.606
No, Bhaiyaji,
you'll have to watch it.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.410
For the sake of your mother...
for the sake of your cow!

28:59.471 --> 29:01.781
For the sake of the
milkman that milks the cow!

29:10.415 --> 29:12.759
What a view!

29:12.884 --> 29:15.091
The Maharaja must
have had great vision!

29:15.186 --> 29:17.029
This is our royal fort.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.702
Take a seat and I'll arrange
for your stay.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.737
Yes we'll sit.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.270
Sir will we get an attached bathroom?

29:25.330 --> 29:28.675
No it's okay. There are fields
and valleys... it's natural.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.713
All we need is cold
water for bathing...

29:30.769 --> 29:33.045
it keeps the body
contract and strong.

29:33.138 --> 29:36.585
- And hot water for drinking.
- For voice and bowel movement...

29:36.775 --> 29:37.651
Yes.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.449
You'll get 24 hours room service too.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.022
- Love you Bhaiji.
- Sir how about a demonstration?

29:42.080 --> 29:43.150
"Radha said..."

29:43.214 --> 29:45.820
No I don't want to see anything.
I've some work.

29:46.017 --> 29:46.654
I'll be right back.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.664
No problem, you go freshen up.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.030
We'll recreate Vrindavan
for you right here.

30:24.956 --> 30:28.062
- Sir...
- Not now. Give the packet.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.707
Doctor if you need any other
equipment or anything else...

30:38.903 --> 30:40.576
it’ll be arranged immediately.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.979
Nothing should happen to the Prince.

30:49.214 --> 30:52.058
Only a handful of us
are left of the Late King's...

30:52.116 --> 30:53.527
trustworthy people.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.164
The future of this
family lies in your hands.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.265
You arrived at the accident spot
at the right time...

31:02.360 --> 31:03.668
thus he survived.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.467
Otherwise such a fatal attack!

31:06.664 --> 31:11.170
His survival is the result
of everyone's prayers.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.583
Why didn't we take him
to the hospital, with security?

31:16.507 --> 31:19.716
When our dear ones cross
all limits of humanity...

31:20.111 --> 31:22.091
then no security can do anything.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.686
When's the coronation?

31:25.316 --> 31:26.294
In four days.

31:26.517 --> 31:28.360
The King decided this date...

31:28.419 --> 31:30.695
according to astrology,
on his death bed.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.596
It can be inauspicious to postpone it.

31:34.192 --> 31:37.366
Doctor it's a case of cerebral
concussion with cerebral edema.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.942
These wounds on his
body will heal soon.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.405
But he's suffered
internal head injuries.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.140
But don't worry...

31:49.540 --> 31:51.577
there are signs of recovery.

31:52.043 --> 31:53.181
Thank you doctor.

31:54.178 --> 31:58.320
No one should know that
the Prince has been kept here.

32:31.249 --> 32:38.224
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

32:38.923 --> 32:42.598
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

32:42.694 --> 32:46.540
"Let's go color Radha."

32:46.597 --> 32:50.443
"Delicate little Radha
is shy of Kanha."

32:50.635 --> 32:54.583
"Lets the lover
only a glimpse of her beauty."

32:54.639 --> 32:58.086
"A shiver runs up her spine."

32:58.142 --> 33:01.851
"Let's go."

33:01.946 --> 33:05.689
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

33:05.750 --> 33:09.493
"Let's go."

33:19.697 --> 33:26.615
Sir, you've always said that
God helps those in great trouble.

33:28.773 --> 33:34.519
"Kisna has taken a liking to
your fair complexion, Radha."

33:34.579 --> 33:39.653
"He wonders
how to color you during Holi."

33:40.284 --> 33:41.695
"Let's go."

33:41.753 --> 33:42.891
What are you trying to say?

33:42.954 --> 33:44.558
Sir the Prince survived this time....

33:44.622 --> 33:48.798
but we still don't know
who's behind this fatal attack.

33:49.327 --> 33:52.865
If he can attack once,
he can attack again.

33:55.466 --> 33:59.846
The Prince can only remain safe here,
when there's another Prince out there!

33:59.904 --> 34:01.508
Is this the time to joke?

34:01.706 --> 34:04.016
Send those two clowns
back immediately!

34:09.112 --> 34:10.114
Yes Your Majesty?

34:10.313 --> 34:13.523
Deewan Saheb,
Maithili and I've been trying...

34:13.583 --> 34:17.464
to call the Prince since a while,
but his phone's switched off.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.032
Maybe he's busy.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.928
We've received
the Princess' schedule...

34:23.460 --> 34:25.202
we’ll all be there to receive her.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.908
Congratulations to all of you!

34:28.299 --> 34:29.676
Thank you.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.014
Guests will be arriving
from all over the world...

34:37.108 --> 34:39.485
along with national
and international media.

34:39.543 --> 34:43.650
What will we tell the Princess
and these people about the Prince?

34:43.915 --> 34:45.860
And how?

35:01.265 --> 35:02.835
Prem Bhaiya?

35:03.201 --> 35:07.274
Did you ever hear that
the King visited our place? - No.

35:07.371 --> 35:10.250
Did mom ever visit
this kingdom? - No.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.820
It's all mom's fault...
he could have been your brother today!

35:13.878 --> 35:18.520
It's just a coincidence that
you two look alike. Nothing more.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.932
I've heard that you're
a very good actor.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.294
Are you hesitating?

35:25.356 --> 35:26.562
Hesitating?

35:27.058 --> 35:32.633
Bapu (UNCLE)...if we decide to imitate
you, even your wife will get confused.

35:32.730 --> 35:37.770
The point is that he wants
me to pose as the Princess' fiance...

35:37.835 --> 35:38.870
for four days!

35:38.936 --> 35:42.907
And four days also include four
nights! What are you talking Bapu?

35:43.007 --> 35:44.452
He'll wake up right?

35:44.509 --> 35:47.046
Or then Prem Bhaiya and
she might end up getting married.

35:47.111 --> 35:48.112
Shut up!

35:49.380 --> 35:52.486
Don't you understand
the gravity of the situation?

35:52.583 --> 35:55.154
It's a matter of the
Prince's life and death.

35:55.586 --> 35:59.932
Bapu we refuse to
deceive our Princess.

36:00.057 --> 36:03.163
Bapu has no maturity.
Let's go!

36:03.327 --> 36:05.898
You're not deceiving her.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.535
In fact you're protecting her fiance!

36:09.734 --> 36:14.376
What if the Princess'
fiancé is attacked again?

36:14.672 --> 36:17.016
What will she go through?

36:22.813 --> 36:24.952
How much money will you charge?

36:25.349 --> 36:27.090
Immature Bapu!

36:27.185 --> 36:29.597
This is our Princess' future home.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.793
It's a matter of our pride and honour!

36:32.857 --> 36:35.463
There's no question of money!

36:40.698 --> 36:44.111
Keep a straight face! Sit straight!

36:51.976 --> 36:53.887
Bapu!

36:54.345 --> 36:56.256
When you have
Dashrath's experience...

36:56.314 --> 36:58.453
why are you getting
impatient like young Laxman?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.586
Let young India work too.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.723
Don't you dare touch anything
of the royal household.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.195
You've a role to play here as well...

37:07.458 --> 37:09.938
your role is of
a senior photographer.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.473
Who's come here
for the coronation.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.339
You've been trying to create a book...

37:14.432 --> 37:16.708
of all the royal family
pictures since 1970.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.337
The beard is fine, so are the clothes.

37:18.569 --> 37:19.775
But you haven't thought of a name yet.

37:19.837 --> 37:21.714
You're such a useless writer.

37:21.772 --> 37:25.151
It's the height of naivety. If Masoorie
uncle was alive, he would've slapped you.

37:25.209 --> 37:26.586
But I'll think of something.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.180
I found a name!

37:28.312 --> 37:29.256
Naadaan Masoorie.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.418
I told you I'll think of something.

37:31.515 --> 37:34.257
I've got it. Naadaan Masoorie!

37:35.052 --> 37:37.089
Why aren't you wearing your shoes?

37:37.655 --> 37:38.895
Put them on me.

37:39.924 --> 37:43.872
I'm not allowed to touch anything
of the royal household, right?

37:45.396 --> 37:47.933
- Bapu!
- Leave me!

37:48.466 --> 37:51.879
Bapu! There should be
some give and take in life.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.782
If you've given me the Prince's role,
give me the freedom to live like him.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.514
Get that blue book
from the book shelf.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.818
Oh come on Bapu is
this a job for a Prince?

38:01.912 --> 38:03.323
Here's your book.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.621
What the...

38:06.550 --> 38:07.824
Masoorie!

38:08.619 --> 38:09.996
Have a look Masoorie...

38:10.054 --> 38:11.556
Listen carefully!

38:12.223 --> 38:13.497
When you pull the blue book out...

38:13.591 --> 38:16.470
it opens this secret
door into the Prince's office.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.298
One of us will be here 24 hours a day.

38:19.397 --> 38:21.809
If there's any emergency,
come inside immediately.

38:21.866 --> 38:22.640
Follow me!

38:22.700 --> 38:24.907
I said, follow me!

38:24.969 --> 38:27.677
Now you'll be shown
a DVD of the Prince.

38:27.738 --> 38:31.743
Observe his style
and the way he speaks.

38:32.877 --> 38:36.791
Look Masoorie,
all our dreams have come true.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.495
Sir, let them eat something first.

38:40.951 --> 38:44.398
They can do anything
while watching the video.

38:44.922 --> 38:47.528
I’m so happy you guys are here!'

38:47.792 --> 38:50.033
'Love you guys!
Thank you!'

38:51.195 --> 38:52.799
Due to weak digestion...

38:52.863 --> 38:54.433
the Prince eats only boiled food.

38:54.732 --> 38:58.475
What's the point of being a Prince if
he eats only green stuff... health freak!

38:58.536 --> 39:00.516
He's like a goat!

39:00.838 --> 39:02.408
From tomorrow you'll
get only boiled food.

39:02.473 --> 39:03.679
- Bapu.
- Shut up!

39:03.741 --> 39:04.719
- Bapu.
- Shut up!

39:04.809 --> 39:05.651
- Ba...
- Shut...

39:05.710 --> 39:06.620
- "..pu...
- up!"

39:07.645 --> 39:13.118
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

39:13.517 --> 39:16.088
The Prince speaks many languages.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.927
He speaks French,
Italian and German fluently.

39:18.989 --> 39:23.597
- A... aa... e... ee... u... uu.
- Well said!

39:24.462 --> 39:28.274
- You don't need to overact for this.
- Overact?

39:28.366 --> 39:32.337
We'll declare that the Prince is observing
a vow of silence for the next four days.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.479
These are the Prince's step-sisters...

39:37.541 --> 39:39.350
Princess Chandrika...

39:39.510 --> 39:41.353
Princess Radhika.

39:45.549 --> 39:50.396
This is that driver Chuttan who took
the royal carriage to the mountains.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.827
The day we lay our hands on him...

39:52.923 --> 39:56.962
we’ll prove that this conspiracy
was planned by these people.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.000
The Prince's step-brother, Ajay Singh.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.805
The Prince's secretary, Sameera.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.407
The Prince's distant relative...

40:03.467 --> 40:07.847
and the estate's CEO,
the cunning Chirag Singh.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.354
Bhaisaheb's flag is still up.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.824
This means he's still alive.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.589
Don't worry sir.

40:20.751 --> 40:26.224
We'll soon find out where
Deewan Saheb has hidden him.

40:26.490 --> 40:30.597
And anyway,
after falling from such a height...

40:30.728 --> 40:33.470
he's probably even
having difficulty breathing.

40:42.540 --> 40:47.785
This beautiful lady from
the 1940s is now yours.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.259
And for the one who told me...

40:51.348 --> 40:55.592
that Bhaisaheb is going to
meet the sisters without any security.

40:56.153 --> 40:59.225
For her... this evergreen girl.

41:00.391 --> 41:01.335
Thank you sir!

41:01.392 --> 41:04.373
You've a big heart, sir... very big.

41:04.862 --> 41:08.309
You've done the big thing
by planning this accident, Chirag.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.546
You've liberated me.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.509
You're lucky you don't
have an elder brother...

41:14.672 --> 41:16.242
to whom you're always compared.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.457
And papa passed away...

41:23.881 --> 41:28.955
but decided that his elder
son will pass all my bills.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.428
Only then can I survive.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.259
And what did the elder son do?

41:34.959 --> 41:39.499
He rejected every bill,
like one does with contractors!

41:40.965 --> 41:43.138
Today for the first time
I have given something

41:43.434 --> 41:44.606
without his permission.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.313
Enjoy!!

41:53.944 --> 41:57.482
Sir, if the younger prince finds out...

41:57.581 --> 42:01.028
that his elder brother
passed all his bills...

42:01.752 --> 42:03.356
and it was you...?

42:04.255 --> 42:07.828
Sameera, these Kings don't have time...

42:08.025 --> 42:11.199
to check every cheque
book and voucher.

42:11.395 --> 42:13.272
That's our job.

42:15.065 --> 42:19.104
We can shake the very
foundation of these palaces.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.680
And this is just the
beginning of my plan...

42:21.739 --> 42:24.345
and your gifts, Sameera.

42:25.409 --> 42:27.389
Let's take a nice picture of you...

42:27.745 --> 42:28.985
- come on!
- Okay.

42:36.787 --> 42:37.788
Yes, sir.

42:38.088 --> 42:41.592
Bhaisaheb has ordered to make arrangements
to welcome the Princess tomorrow.

42:41.659 --> 42:44.799
He's personally going to the
station tomorrow to receive her.

42:44.962 --> 42:47.238
How's it possible? Huh?

42:50.601 --> 42:52.308
The Prince will be here soon.

42:52.369 --> 42:55.316
I'll find out everything
and inform you Chirag sir.

42:55.472 --> 42:57.042
- Sameera.
- Yeah?

42:57.207 --> 43:00.154
- I want to introduce you to a special guest.
- Oh! Yes, yes!

43:00.277 --> 43:01.756
- Come.
- Please.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.388
Hello, dear.

43:04.648 --> 43:07.390
Sameera, the Prince's orders are...

43:07.484 --> 43:11.864
that you'll look after Mr. Masoorie
until the coronation.

43:12.256 --> 43:16.329
His travel arrangements, comfortable
stay... that's your responsibility.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.836
But the Prince didn't
tell me anything.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.433
He told me... to tell you.

43:22.132 --> 43:22.735
Okay.

43:22.833 --> 43:28.909
Sameera... a camera stand for
Mr. Masoorie, please.

43:29.907 --> 43:30.908
Right away.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.143
Of course.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.120
Why are you involving
me with this girl?

43:38.182 --> 43:40.355
Don't you see I've immersed
in my character?

43:40.417 --> 43:44.388
Look, don't let Sameera
anywhere near Prem Dilwala.

43:44.488 --> 43:46.161
What if she gets suspicious?

43:47.625 --> 43:48.797
But...

43:50.361 --> 43:53.604
- Consider this a part of your role.
- This? How?

43:53.664 --> 43:56.042
- You've heard of love?
- Hmmm.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.478
That's what you feel for her.

43:58.636 --> 44:02.812
You've fit this angle of love
nicely in this story.

44:02.873 --> 44:03.715
WOW!

44:04.208 --> 44:06.552
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:06.644 --> 44:09.250
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:09.313 --> 44:11.554
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:11.615 --> 44:13.993
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:14.084 --> 44:16.291
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:16.353 --> 44:18.458
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

44:23.427 --> 44:26.067
The Princess is arriving.
Concentrate!

44:26.230 --> 44:27.675
I know.

44:29.400 --> 44:33.507
Do Bapu and Mrs. Bapu always fight?
He's always sullen.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.843
He isn't married.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.575
You mean virgin Bapu!

44:37.374 --> 44:39.547
You're observing a vow of silence,
keep your mouth shut!

44:39.777 --> 44:41.154
Give this to the Princess.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.323
Sanjay!!

44:46.250 --> 44:47.354
The Princess!

45:10.207 --> 45:15.919
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

45:15.979 --> 45:21.622
"I might say that I look up to her."

45:24.555 --> 45:29.868
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

45:30.160 --> 45:35.701
"I might say that I look up to her."

45:39.136 --> 45:41.878
Long live the Princess!

45:42.139 --> 45:43.345
Give the flowers.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.150
Not to me, to the Princess!

46:19.443 --> 46:22.117
I hope you had a comfortable journey.

46:22.412 --> 46:24.085
Yes... thank you.

46:24.314 --> 46:25.816
How are you?

46:26.016 --> 46:27.324
All okay.

46:27.684 --> 46:29.129
How's grandma?

46:29.219 --> 46:30.596
She's fine.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.927
In fact she also wanted to come...

46:32.990 --> 46:36.233
but couldn't
due to her knee problem.

46:37.027 --> 46:39.303
She sends her love.

46:39.997 --> 46:43.274
The Prince is observing
a vow of silence for a few days.

46:43.567 --> 46:44.875
Vow of silence?

46:45.068 --> 46:49.847
He says that people observe
a vow of silence for inner peace.

46:49.907 --> 46:52.547
He has his own ways!

47:00.918 --> 47:04.832
By the way,
the Prince is allowed to hum.

47:06.456 --> 47:09.562
We've made arrangements for
your stay at the royal guest house...

47:09.626 --> 47:13.005
but before that you'll have
lunch with the Prince at the palace.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.507
Serve properly,
there shouldn't be any mistakes.

47:18.602 --> 47:22.140
And the Prince shouldn't
break his vow of silence.

47:28.579 --> 47:30.115
Thank you.

48:13.924 --> 48:17.736
I'm sorry, but
I can't take this any longer.

48:18.962 --> 48:23.001
I've been a self-confident
girl all my life.

48:23.267 --> 48:26.646
But for the first time
I'm losing my bearings.

48:27.304 --> 48:30.717
I need to know
where I'm going wrong.

48:34.778 --> 48:37.725
Your Highness, we've been
engaged for five months...

48:37.781 --> 48:42.526
and we've hardly communicated
more than five times!

48:43.020 --> 48:45.967
I know you're not
ready for this marriage...

48:46.023 --> 48:49.129
and you couldn't go against
the Late King's orders.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.762
You're already burdened
with a lot of responsibilities...

48:51.828 --> 48:54.206
and you don't want
to add another one.

48:54.364 --> 48:57.743
Especially, when there's already
so much tension in the family.

48:58.035 --> 49:02.279
I understand that those
who are independent-minded...

49:02.439 --> 49:05.318
don't like to be bossed around.

49:05.709 --> 49:07.279
But is this fair?

49:07.878 --> 49:13.988
If we want to spend our lives together,
we can't live like strangers.

49:14.484 --> 49:20.594
I can't live in fear, not knowing
when you'll get angry or yell at me.

49:24.261 --> 49:27.037
I always wanted people around us...

49:27.097 --> 49:29.304
so that a scene isn't created.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.076
I don't even know you.

49:34.271 --> 49:35.944
Your Highness...

49:36.974 --> 49:41.354
if you're not happy,
then we can go our separate ways.

49:41.511 --> 49:43.081
I'm happy in Delhi.

49:43.146 --> 49:46.423
Uphaar Foundation
and my business keep me busy.

49:46.516 --> 49:49.690
I'll make grandma understand,
no problem.

49:50.120 --> 49:54.034
I didn't even know that
you're observing a vow of silence.

49:58.595 --> 50:00.074
I'm sorry.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.270
But it's your mistake

50:05.369 --> 50:07.076
and you'll agree with me.

50:07.137 --> 50:10.118
You never expressed
your feelings to me.

50:10.173 --> 50:12.119
Because if you had,
then I would've listened...

50:12.175 --> 50:14.348
and if I'd listened,
I would've appreciated it...

50:14.411 --> 50:16.015
and understood.

50:16.213 --> 50:18.250
So... how do I make up for this?

50:18.348 --> 50:22.023
Will you finish this, or should
I order a special watermelon for you?

50:22.119 --> 50:24.656
What about your vow
of silence for inner peace?

50:24.755 --> 50:25.961
Vow of silence!

50:26.023 --> 50:30.438
You see... a great scholar
Baba Prem told me...

50:30.527 --> 50:33.667
that until you don't
spread happiness in the world...

50:33.830 --> 50:36.242
you can't attain inner peace.

50:36.299 --> 50:38.006
You want to know my secrets?

50:38.135 --> 50:39.978
My highs, my lows...

50:40.070 --> 50:42.141
..my ups, my downs?

50:42.205 --> 50:43.513
Give me a minute.

50:43.774 --> 50:45.219
Deewan...

50:45.842 --> 50:47.219
Saheb!

50:48.779 --> 50:50.622
What's wrong, your Highness?

50:51.848 --> 50:54.089
You took a vow of silence!

50:54.184 --> 50:57.097
I decided to break it.

50:57.421 --> 50:58.832
Does not matter.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.460
We need to show the
Princess "those-those" places...

51:01.558 --> 51:03.799
where I spent my childhood.

51:04.094 --> 51:06.802
Please make the arrangements.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.546
Move it!

51:11.935 --> 51:13.107
Move it?

51:17.607 --> 51:19.917
The Prince studied in this
school till 8th grade.

51:19.976 --> 51:21.978
This school was built in 1907.

51:22.079 --> 51:25.424
It's architecture was believed
to be very modern in those days.

51:25.515 --> 51:28.724
There was an All-India Kabbadi
Competition held here in 1921.

51:28.785 --> 51:32.995
The All-Asian Hockey Tournament
was held here in 1945.

51:33.056 --> 51:35.627
There was a Literary
Conference in 1960.

51:35.759 --> 51:39.138
These arches are world famous!
You won't find these...

51:41.164 --> 51:44.577
Let me tell you a world
famous story from 3rd grade.

51:44.668 --> 51:48.946
I used to trick my teacher,
bunk school... and bathe here...

51:51.241 --> 51:52.413
Naked!

51:52.909 --> 51:53.649
Huh?

51:57.581 --> 51:59.288
Deewan Saheb, is this true?

51:59.382 --> 52:01.828
Deewan Saheb himself
was my swimming coach.

52:01.918 --> 52:05.263
He taught me freestyle,
butterfly and breast stroke.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.594
Say yes, or else I'll
tell her that you also...

52:07.657 --> 52:11.662
used to bathe here
with me... naked!

52:14.131 --> 52:15.633
Those were the days.

52:15.699 --> 52:17.076
Today's a better day.

52:17.134 --> 52:20.581
Come Deewan Saheb let's
show the Princess our diving point.

52:20.670 --> 52:21.512
No, no...

52:28.311 --> 52:30.848
What are you looking
there for Sweetie?

52:30.947 --> 52:32.756
I'm the one worth looking at.

52:33.016 --> 52:34.051
What do you want?

52:36.253 --> 52:37.926
A blue car?

52:40.056 --> 52:41.433
What is happening, Chirag?

52:42.492 --> 52:45.336
Sameera isn't able to report
anything, and you're quiet as well.

52:45.595 --> 52:47.768
I understand that even
after such a great fall...

52:47.864 --> 52:49.741
..Bhaisaheb survived medically.

52:49.833 --> 52:53.371
But, receiving the Princess
personally at the station...

52:53.503 --> 52:55.983
and now giving her
a tour of the estate...

52:56.206 --> 52:57.207
<i>No!</i>

52:58.542 --> 53:00.749
This can't be Bhaisaheb!

53:04.181 --> 53:06.354
Something's definitely wrong, sir.

53:12.322 --> 53:13.995
Very wrong!

53:28.305 --> 53:29.978
How are you doing,
Bhabhi (SISTER-IN-LAW)?

53:30.040 --> 53:31.348
Welcome to your future home.

53:31.408 --> 53:32.887
Hi Ajay, how are you?

53:32.976 --> 53:37.186
- Bapu... what's with the kisses?
- They're saying hello.

53:38.448 --> 53:39.927
- What are you doing?
- Hello!

53:41.117 --> 53:42.596
By the way,
I can't believe it!

53:42.652 --> 53:46.225
He's giving you a tour of the estate...
how romantic!

53:48.625 --> 53:51.333
He's won so many polo
tournaments in this club.

53:51.428 --> 53:52.338
Hey, wait a minute!

53:52.429 --> 53:55.239
Bhabhi, I'm sure you
remember the tournament...

53:55.298 --> 53:59.144
..that Bhaisaheb played
on your engagement day?

54:06.343 --> 54:08.983
Anyways I'll leave
the two love-birds alone... okay?

54:09.079 --> 54:10.752
Okay, Bhaisaheb.

54:11.348 --> 54:14.693
- Enjoy.
- Okay. And over here...

54:17.721 --> 54:21.828
Bapu, what was he trying to instigate?
Scoundrel!

54:21.925 --> 54:24.565
You and your "those-those" places!

54:30.367 --> 54:34.440
You had invited all your
friends to meet me that day.

54:34.738 --> 54:36.945
We were all joking...

54:37.007 --> 54:43.424
and I said that you'd look
better without your moustache.

54:45.115 --> 54:49.996
I don't know what made you so angry
that you left me alone and came here.

54:50.086 --> 54:52.498
No, no... don't cry.

54:53.957 --> 54:58.497
Actually... that was my
style of expressing love.

55:01.164 --> 55:02.973
You love me?

55:03.033 --> 55:03.943
Yes...

55:05.001 --> 55:06.844
very much.

55:07.837 --> 55:10.340
But I don't know how to express it.

55:11.241 --> 55:14.688
Let's go...
for a romantic walk?

55:34.731 --> 55:36.005
Ram-Laxman!

55:36.599 --> 55:37.634
Come here!

55:37.701 --> 55:38.736
Quickly quickly!

55:38.835 --> 55:40.280
Like the wind!

55:40.337 --> 55:41.475
Terminators!

55:41.705 --> 55:43.343
Diary! Pen!

55:43.573 --> 55:44.677
Where are you two from?

55:44.841 --> 55:45.615
Gujarat.

55:45.809 --> 55:48.517
Silly boys... sit here...

55:49.312 --> 55:50.791
and turn around.

55:53.983 --> 55:55.223
Before we go any further...

55:55.318 --> 55:57.798
list all your complaints now.

55:58.054 --> 56:01.194
Moustache,
shirt, tie, pant, underwear, vest...

56:01.291 --> 56:02.429
don't leave anything out.

56:02.525 --> 56:04.129
Open your heart.

56:04.728 --> 56:08.676
But don't make me write
that I don't love you.

56:15.839 --> 56:19.912
"You come closer
whenever you want."

56:23.713 --> 56:27.820
"You go away whenever you want."

56:29.018 --> 56:31.624
Oh God!

56:39.662 --> 56:43.235
"You come closer
whenever you want."

56:43.533 --> 56:47.504
"You go away whenever you want."

56:47.604 --> 56:51.381
"You always do as you please."

56:51.441 --> 56:55.548
"Yet you say you love me."

56:55.812 --> 56:59.954
"I accept my mistake
and my misbehavior."

57:00.016 --> 57:02.963
"Love makes me do crazy things."

57:03.019 --> 57:07.161
"We break up and patch up
as per your wishes."

57:11.094 --> 57:15.042
"We meet whenever you wish."

57:19.035 --> 57:22.847
"You always do as you please."

57:23.039 --> 57:26.816
"What kind of a lover are you?"

57:28.178 --> 57:31.591
Wow! You look like a father of nine.

57:32.382 --> 57:35.625
Now you like a father of none!

57:36.019 --> 57:38.522
Sorry I made you wait.

57:43.493 --> 57:44.836
Moustache?

57:45.495 --> 57:48.237
Romance, Deewan Saheb. Romance.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.608
You won't understand
the romance of young India.

57:50.667 --> 57:53.443
The Princess didn't like my moustache,
so I shaved it off.

57:53.503 --> 57:56.916
Princess, do you not like my nose?
Should I cut that off too?

57:56.973 --> 57:58.281
What do you say Deewan Saheb?

57:58.341 --> 58:00.821
You can cut anyone's
nose any time sir.

58:00.877 --> 58:02.117
Of course.

58:02.212 --> 58:03.555
About turn.

58:08.051 --> 58:08.586
This is the temple...

58:08.685 --> 58:11.222
where the Prince's first
birthday was celebrated.

58:11.454 --> 58:13.627
The foundation of this
temple was laid in 1953...

58:13.723 --> 58:15.498
by the Chief Minister himself.

58:15.558 --> 58:17.469
Many Union Cabinet ministers
graced the occasion as well.

58:17.627 --> 58:19.538
The place was packed.

58:19.596 --> 58:24.511
Flowers were being showered
from one entrance to the other.

58:26.035 --> 58:27.605
Hey! Come here.

58:27.871 --> 58:28.849
I said stop!

58:28.905 --> 58:30.646
Bapu, stop your preaching.

58:30.874 --> 58:32.376
As soon as you start
the geography of some place...

58:32.475 --> 58:35.684
it reminds her of her history,
and I've to pull out this diary.

58:35.845 --> 58:38.985
You'll tell the Princes
only what I tell you. Understand?

58:39.082 --> 58:39.753
Huh?

58:41.384 --> 58:42.294
Okay Bapu.

58:42.418 --> 58:45.661
From your own experiences with ladies...

58:45.722 --> 58:49.397
tell me how do I cajole this lady?

58:50.193 --> 58:51.001
I...

58:51.060 --> 58:52.061
Waiting Bapu.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.572
Telling.

58:53.663 --> 58:57.110
Bapu, you've zero
experience with ladies.

58:57.166 --> 59:00.409
Your wisdom is
incomplete... Virgin Bapu!

59:01.838 --> 59:04.444
I'll tell the world
that you're a Virgin Bapu!

59:06.009 --> 59:09.286
You haven't seen
this lamp decoration before....

59:09.512 --> 59:12.493
recently we've been
doing it every evening.

59:12.549 --> 59:17.521
The Late King would enjoy
poetry in the light of these lamps.

59:18.421 --> 59:22.927
He used to spend quality
time with the Queen here.

59:22.992 --> 59:25.336
Oh... how sweet.

59:28.031 --> 59:29.977
- Bapu.
- What?

59:30.033 --> 59:34.140
Quality time out here? Weren't
there enough rooms in the palace?

59:34.237 --> 59:35.341
Keep quiet!

59:35.705 --> 59:37.548
- But Bapu...
- Now shut up!

59:43.913 --> 59:48.293
That night I had arranged
a special barbeque for you there.

59:48.885 --> 59:51.161
It took me three hours...

59:51.354 --> 59:56.565
to get ready in your
favourite short dress.

59:57.193 --> 01:00:01.107
And only because
we promised each other...

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:04.245
that we wouldn't fight that evening.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:08.576
We'd only talk about love.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.345
And you...

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:14.551
And I...?

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:18.656
'So what if I took you in my arms?
What else is love?'

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.256
Isn't this what you said?

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:26.499
We couldn't discuss
our future or our feelings.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:30.797
If only you understood
what a girl really wants.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.907
That was our last fight
and also our last meeting.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.135
Prince, you didn't
leave any stone unturned?

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.578
You're messing up everything!

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.979
Quality time before marriage?

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:45.585
Now it's confirmed that
the Prince is a rascal!

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:34.558
"I still have to learn
the finer nuances of love."

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:38.896
"Teach me if you have the time."

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:46.780
"Teach me how to impress a lover
with sweet talk."

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:50.716
"Teach me how to
make her give up anger."

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:54.619
"You make mistakes
and act innocent."

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.124
"Stop these tricks."

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:02.323
- "Don't try to impress me.
- Don't make things worse."

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.958
"Don't even try to
patch up with me."

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.902
"You can make
the evening lovely."

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:23.145
"You can make
the night beautiful."

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.955
"I accept whatever punishment
you give me."

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:35.325
"Just give me smile."

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:43.700
Spit it out!

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:44.803
Spit it out!

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:45.839
I said spit it out!

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:48.239
Camel, return my diary!

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:51.471
Give it back,
you won't be able to digest it!

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:52.740
You'll get diarrhea.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.543
Brother Camel! Brother Camel!

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.582
Please.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:56.911
I beg of you, Brother Camel.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.712
I touch your feet, Brother Camel.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:02.484
Brother Camel. I will even kiss you,
Brother Camel.

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:08.892
I'll take this one... pack this.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.898
Oh Bhaiji...

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:19.531
I have to eat boiled food because
of the Prince's weak digestion.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.905
On top of that I
have to lie 25,000 times.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.705
As soon as your Prince
wakes up from coma...

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.972
I’ll put a full stop to all this.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:29.947
And I'll ask for a cheque
of Rs.25,000 for Uphaar Foundation.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.019
Is that less?

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.921
Come in. Come in. Come in.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.985
What are you eating?

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.723
Well, I won't lie to you.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.962
The doctor has forced
me to eat boiled food...

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:51.233
but sometimes I eat what I like.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.506
But your weak digestion?

01:03:55.598 --> 01:04:00.047
Princess... it's all in the mind!

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.377
Hold this.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.216
Where are you going?

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:07.914
- I'm thirsty, going to drink water.
- Here, I have water.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.818
Not from a bottle like a baby.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:15.291
Like a kid,
with kids, full of life!

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:20.228
Kids, now I'll help
you drink water. Come on!

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:21.993
Here you go!

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.806
Drink up!

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.407
Enough, now my turn!

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.629
What's all this?

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.039
Chandrika!

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.768
Fix your tie.
Let's go home.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:04.937
Hi, Chandrika!

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:11.580
I'm coming there!

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.953
Where've you been?

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.436
Radhika, you're looking so different.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:34.035
So grown up, so cute.

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:35.471
You'll live a long life.

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:39.410
I bought this silver bracelet today,
just like those we wore in school.

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.277
Give me your hand.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:00.463
Rickshaw!

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.268
- Listen Chandrika...
- Let's go!

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.288
Princess Maithili
and Princess Chandrika...

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:31.264
used to study together
in boarding school.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.266
They were very good friends.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.326
They were called the Royal Fairies.

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:40.567
But ever since Maithili
got engaged to our Prince...

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:44.969
Chandrika broke
all ties with her.

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:47.510
The elder sister has
a lot of self-respect...

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:51.608
she heads the accounts
department of a small school.

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:56.948
Both sisters live in a rented
house with basic amenities.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.122
Radhika!

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.826
Radhika, open the door!

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:06.094
It must be the mechanic
with the serviced fridge.

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:11.337
Good morning, Radhika!

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.806
Your Santa Claus brother
with the big heart...

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:17.274
has brought you a new TV,
new fridge, new washing machine

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:22.611
and in bonus has also brought
a microwave, a kettle and a football.

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:30.347
Your big brother's
also brought two big beds...

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:33.893
and two queen size mattresses
for my two Princess sisters.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.486
Come on, unload everything.
And give me that.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:40.967
And as bonus, I've brought
this key and that car.

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:45.339
Please accept all my gifts.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:51.238
And Chanda,
let's just bury the past!

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.807
Of course.

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:57.749
But before that can
we talk in private. Please?

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.716
So what's your offer?

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:12.664
There's no offer,
I just brought some gifts.

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:13.698
And...

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.062
a request. Keep this.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:23.243
From one royal fairy
to the other... a gift of love.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:28.680
By taking these you want us to
accept that you've won and we've lost?

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:32.712
There's no winning or losing
amongst siblings.

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:35.948
What relationships is
he talking about Mr. Bhandari?

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:40.389
Which anyone can buy in the market?

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:45.488
Where one starts a relationship
only for his advantage!

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:50.894
Please ask him Uncle...

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:55.874
what does the
Queen's son want...

01:08:56.866 --> 01:09:00.609
from the King's mistress' daughters?

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:10.817
And if you're here to show
your greatness and generosity...

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.487
then pardon me,
but we don't need your favours.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.661
Take everything back!

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.090
Didn't you hear me?

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:29.809
And if it's against the future King's
honour to take these things back...

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.344
then it's perfectly alright.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:35.974
We have no such honour to
lose by throwing these things out.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.788
Come Radhika!

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.474
Hey, put that in the center!

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.343
And reflect this
light in that direction...

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:44.145
the poor girls are melting
like ice-cream in the sun.

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:45.412
One minute...

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:48.420
girls... shake your waists.

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:54.690
You'll be on the front
page of my book, wonderful!

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.026
Ready?

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:00.626
Shake!

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.471
You're taking a still picture, right?
So why should I shake?

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.671
Don't try to teach me!

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:11.971
Click fast!

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:12.971
Yeah!

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.176
Sameera, what's happening?

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:21.350
Sir I'm busy with this uncle.

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.723
And where are you Chirag?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.188
I'm outside the palace sir.

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.660
Getting cars ready for the guests.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.059
Oh, I see.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.093
And I'm ready for my sherwani trial...

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.667
that I'm wearing for the coronation.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:40.365
The coronation is tomorrow!
What are we doing?

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:44.742
There are still 24 hours
left for the coronation sir.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:50.049
And I'm keeping my eye on every single
thing, and on every single person!

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:13.803
Hello.

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.139
Go carefully Chaudhary.

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.469
And feed the Prince with care.

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.771
Yes sir.

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.418
Dilwale!

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.458
Is this the time to sleep?

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:37.152
I wasn't sleeping I was thinking...

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.857
these royal men wear
such tight clothes.

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:44.529
Bapu, what if someone
has to go to the washroom? - Hey!

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.502
It's confirmed, now I know!

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.097
I don't like jokes all the time.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.506
Lower your feet, stand up!

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:51.408
Yes devil... I mean Deewan!

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:55.571
You created such a big scene
at the sisters' house yesterday...

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:58.550
thankfully everything
remained within their home.

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:01.486
Today's function is at
the garden close to their house.

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.489
Nothing should go wrong, understand?

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:08.418
Bapu, the sisters'
mother was not a Queen?

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:12.563
None of your business!
They aren't your sisters!

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:18.972
Yes Sanjay.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:20.832
Fine.

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.834
Princess Maithili is waiting for you...

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.538
in the Prince's personal suite.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:31.209
Remember,
the Princess isn't yours either!

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.418
Bapu's lost it. Totally mad.

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.405
I'm waiting.

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:07.586
Get well soon, Prince...
Bapu's making my life miserable.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:14.984
Oh drat!

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:25.364
Beautiful lady,
there's still some time for this!

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:32.536
Another secret... a secret passage!

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.715
That goes from one heart to the other?

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.851
I've brought food
from Haldiram's shop.

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:43.549
Your doctors will be at the party so
they won't let you eat it... eat fast!

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.423
Did you come specially for this?

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.462
I also wanted to say sorry...

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:55.758
for all the complaints
that I made you write.

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:59.601
I've realized what true love is.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:05.936
The Prince went to his sisters'
house to make amends, for my sake.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:10.149
If that isn't true love,
then what else is it?

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.751
Your coronation functions start today.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:22.019
Will you find a better hostess
than me... to make them memorable?

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.515
Pardon me, Princess...

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:48.555
we called you and the
Prince here before the guests arrived.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.420
Actually, we needed to discuss
today's program with the Prince.

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.459
That's okay Deewan Saheb...
I also wanted to check...

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.790
whether the flower
arrangement in the banquet area...

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.990
is as we decided earlier.
Excuse me!

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.794
- Hold on.
- Yes, Bapu?

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:02.597
- Take this.
- Oh a book?

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.334
The "History of Our Kings".

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.806
Your speech today will
be in pure Hindi. - Huh?

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.467
Yes, memorize it.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:12.202
Today's protocol, first your speech...

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:15.146
followed by classical music...

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:18.141
after that classical dance....

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:20.349
and then finally lunch!

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.921
Oh... lunch Bapu.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.320
Boiled for you.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:24.513
- No!
- Yes!

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.054
Yeah.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.367
If I were the same old Maithili...

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:48.947
then I definitely would
have misspelled your name.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:02.193
Jiji (SISTER)! I'm going to school
for football practice.

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:05.788
No, we won't step
out of the house today.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:09.295
Why should we stay at home
because of the Prince's function?

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:12.233
No arguments Radhika!
I don't want anyone to think...

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.431
that we're a part of
their happiness in any way.

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:16.169
Come help me.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.437
Radhika!

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:45.663
- It's okay I'll redo it.
- No, no.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:50.574
Today my football loving
sister will decorate this with you.

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:54.336
If I don't make her your
assistant in this function...

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.507
then my name isn't...

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.911
the name you're writing so lovingly.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.011
But for this, I need your permission.

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:03.056
I want to forget
that I'm a King's son.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:07.184
I want to pretend that I'm a villager,
for the betterment of the family.

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:10.091
- Please help!
- Permission granted.

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:14.390
- Then you'll also have to play along.
- Play along?

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:19.199
Imagine that we're enacting
the play of Ram-Leela, and you...?

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:24.438
Sita will do exactly...
what Lord Rama wishes.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.682
A warm welcome to everyone.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.788
And now our future King...

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:40.360
will address all
of you with a few words.

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.292
I request His Majesty...

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.877
Ladies...!

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.353
Ladies and Gentlemen!

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.886
As always, it's time to...

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:15.861
give a long speech in pure Hindi...

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:19.327
the length and breadth of which...

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:25.338
can bore you, put you
to sleep, and make you run away.

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:27.638
This ground has a history...

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:35.476
that long ago people
played "Padh Kanduk" (FOOTBALL)...

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:40.919
So for the satisfaction of our
ancestors' spirits...

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.980
can we play football again,
why not?

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:58.267
Sorry sir...

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.202
Bhaiji...

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.102
Bhaiji...

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:04.875
Sir...

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:14.314
Sir! Did you get cold feet
at the thought of playing football?

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:17.186
Where's your youthful energy?

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:21.457
Your Highness,
you just challenged a Punjabi.

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:25.162
I haven't lost my youth or my game.

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.627
You let it be.

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:27.564
<i>I see...</i>

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:30.728
Then come on friends,
let's show them what we can do.

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:34.530
Let's go get them!

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:38.669
- Buckle up, friends!
- Let's go!

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.846
Come on my heroes!

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:48.917
Sir, one minute!

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.489
Another hero!

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.250
Poor hero.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:55.551
Dear ladies... while the
gentlemen play football...

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.722
you can chatter and gossip.

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.595
Excuse me!

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.127
Yes.

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:04.696
What do you mean
'chatter and gossip'?

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.067
We'll play too.

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:11.935
Look who's asking for the moon!

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:16.812
Pardon me Princess, playing
football isn't your cup of tea.

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:20.114
Your place is in the
kitchen cutting vegetables...

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:22.345
cut... cut... cut... cut... cut!

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:28.628
Hey, what nonsense! We can also play!

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.960
Ma'am, why're you sitting
shy like a new bride?

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.399
Do you want to spend your life in the
kitchen, or prove something to them?

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:39.495
You're challenging a Punjabi woman?

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.701
Enough of cooking and cleaning.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.069
All day, just 'open the door...
close the door...

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.911
open the door... close the door!'

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.178
The time has come to show...

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.150
what girls can do
on the playing field.

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.985
So let's rock girls
and kick some ball!

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:57.955
Yeah!

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:01.123
Let's get on the field!

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:05.925
Excuse me, excuse me!
You're all mistaken!

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.627
Sorry, Deewan Saheb,
we can't take you in our team...

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:11.169
our team's full!
We give you to the girl's team!

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.536
- Take him away!
- What joke is this?

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.270
- Deewan Saheb how do we play this game?
- I don't know.

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.973
You just need to kick the ball.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.142
They don't remember birthdays,
anniversaries, or love!

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.752
- Sir, goalkeeper.
- Yes.

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:31.382
- Masoorie uncle... backward.
- No, no, forward.

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.754
<i>Forward.</i>

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:36.194
Referee... full on cheating, or else...

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.335
How was my acting?

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.137
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.075
She's watching too.

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:56.542
Today can I also forget
that I'm a Princess?

01:22:56.604 --> 01:23:00.984
And pretend that I'm a village girl...
who loves a village boy!

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:15.565
"Come here, you carefree girl."

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:20.129
"You have become quarrelsome."

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:30.647
"Rude and arrogant
is your behaviour."

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:36.451
"Let's fight it off."

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:40.287
"Let's fight it off."

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:44.724
"You want a fight
and you'll get it."

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:47.991
"Give it your best shot."

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:53.665
"Let's fight it off."

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:58.072
"Let's fight it off."

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.210
Ouch!

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:07.653
Goal!

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:13.887
Referee foul! Foul! This is not fair!

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:22.400
Radhika go wash and
dry these clothes. - Jiji.

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:23.795
Go!

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.352
Goal!

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.792
Goal!

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.226
No!

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.731
Sister, one goal.

01:24:55.824 --> 01:25:01.775
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:07.542
"Do not stare at me."

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:13.244
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:18.484
"Do not stare at me."

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.628
"Scared you are to look into my eyes.
What kind of a man are you?"

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:27.757
"How will you make me yours?"

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:33.534
"Let's fight it off."

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:37.508
"Let's fight it off."

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:38.841
Ouch!

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.812
Goal!

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:57.255
- Yeah?
- Good news sir!

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.639
Ouch!

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.440
What are you doing?

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.709
Go away!

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.461
Oh come on!

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:53.844
Ouch!

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:56.881
Ouch!

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:43.295
Ouch!

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:24.530
Let's go!

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:42.718
Start packing Radhika. We won't stay
in this estate for another minute.

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:54.030
Hurry up Radhika!

01:29:56.991 --> 01:30:00.700
Do sisters leave their
families before marriage?

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:04.743
Please stop your fake
filmy dialogue and gestures!

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:07.113
Do you really care about us?

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:11.139
Do you actually know what
we're going through and what we want?

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.109
What do you want?

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:18.514
We want the palace you live in!
Will you give it?

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.357
The same palace where your
mother lived with the King...

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:26.591
but the doors were
always closed for our mother.

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.998
All her life our mother
shed tears in this house...

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:32.469
while the King had one celebration
after the other over there.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:36.498
The same palace where you'll
celebrate with your Queen.

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.566
We want that palace!

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.710
Go away! Attend to your guests!

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:56.990
The palace will be given to you.

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:04.060
This is your filmy
brother's promise to you.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.867
With what right did you promise
the sisters this palace?

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.638
I thought it'll make them happy...

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.842
but only for my knowledge Bapu...

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.109
is this palace more
important than their happiness?

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:20.618
Only the Prince has the right
to ask this question, not you!

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.278
Would he have refused?

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:25.846
In that case... the Prince
needs to learn a lot from us!

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.893
What did you say?

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:30.429
Look Deewan Saheb
everything's going well...

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.260
someday you'll give us an award.

01:31:32.353 --> 01:31:33.889
You want an award?

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.559
Here's your award!
Bloody clowns!

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.230
Sanjay, get the car
now and drop them...

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:42.069
at the same market
you picked them up from.

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:46.168
I've endured your daily antics,
but not anymore!

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.049
And what are you waiting for?

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:52.276
The Prince is fully
aware of our cover up...

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:55.411
he's said he'll be present
for his coronation tomorrow.

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:58.423
Don't forget that we've also
nabbed that driver Chuttan...

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:02.484
soon he'll confess who
conspired to kill the Prince!

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:05.822
Dilwale, you're not
needed here anymore...

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.921
<i>out“!</i>

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.193
Get out!

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:11.698
How can artists be respected
in a place where humanity isn't?

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.761
Let's go Prem Bhaiya!

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:18.842
Hello.

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:20.945
What?

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:32.755
When we got here...

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.158
the Prince wasn't here, and...

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:45.703
Deewan Saheb,
we found this note here.

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:49.702
'We're taking him with us.'

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:55.737
'There's no need for
two Princes in one kingdom!'

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:01.075
Deewan Saheb?

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:02.646
I'm fine!

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.487
Careful Deewan Saheb!

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.269
How's Bapu?

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:29.906
He suffered another asthma attack.

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.914
He already has high sugar...

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.283
the doctor has advised
him rest.

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:39.557
We added to his tension didn't we?

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:47.394
Deewan Saheb, I'll find the
Prince and bring him back...

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.264
he’ll be fine.

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:52.504
I know the Prince will be fine.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.965
Chuttan is in our custody...

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:58.608
Ajay knows if
he hurts the Prince...

01:33:58.766 --> 01:34:01.804
then we'll make
Chuttan confess in public...

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:04.509
his secret will be exposed.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:14.320
Your Majesty, in order to
save one of your sons...

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:18.791
..we’ll have to strike
a deal with the other.

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:25.566
Forgive me Your Majesty,
I couldn't unite your children...

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:29.273
you always wanted
them to stay together...

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:33.574
you built the Sheesh Mahal
(PALACE OF MIRRORS) with that dream...

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:37.980
Kids have a look!

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:49.055
Gifts for all of you!

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:53.923
This is for you... for you...
and for you!

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:57.258
Deewan Saheb this
Sheesh Mahal is a symbol...

01:34:57.324 --> 01:35:00.066
of these children's innocence.

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:03.038
Their mothers are different and...

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:06.267
that was my weakness.

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:12.541
But their hearts are one,
and that's their strength!

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:22.816
I want the children to
keep visiting this Sheesh Mahal...

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.690
and every mirror here...

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.932
should reflect their
golden childhood to them!

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:34.606
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:39.301
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.871
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:48.080
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:52.582
"Life was simple."

01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:57.621
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:02.031
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:06.367
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:53.683
"Without you, darling,
everything seems unreal."

01:36:53.741 --> 01:37:03.526
"Days and evenings
are spent in loneliness."

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:09.590
"Without you, darling.."

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.838
I'll click a photo too.

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:18.334
She can't take a photo!

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:20.401
She can't take a photo!
Not her... not her....

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.139
Ajay let her click!

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.741
Ajay!

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.819
Ajay!

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:33.291
Ajay, give me your hand!
Come on!

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:36.221
- Bhaiya!
- Ajay!

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:41.460
Ajay don't be scared!

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:44.066
Bhaiya!

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:45.827
Give me your other hand!

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:47.902
Come on Ajay!

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:50.272
- Take care of the kids.
- Kids, move!

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.006
Ajay!

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:55.972
Ajay, give him your hand.
Be careful.

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:18.303
Now your teaching your
kid to take others' kids lives?

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:22.438
This teacher will only
remain your mistress!

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:24.874
If I see her again I'll kill her!

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:28.208
I'm not going to entertain
your first wife's son...

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:30.373
and your mistress!

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:34.644
'Since that day both the mothers
refused to send their children here.'

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:38.815
'The feud between the women
shattered the King's heart...'

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:44.692
'...he decided to divide his home,
properties and estate.'

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.731
'The children could no
longer meet each other...'

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:50.893
'...and the Sheesh Mahal
was closed forever!'

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:59.773
I advised him to let the children
spend their childhood together...

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:02.473
so that hatred would not affect them.

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:04.573
That's exactly what happened.

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:07.812
Spending one's
childhood with siblings...

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:13.221
is as sacred as reciting
the 'Bhagwad Gita' or the 'Ramayana'.

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:20.263
You must have been a
saint in your past life Bapu.

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:25.966
Will you desert your
Bapu in such circumstances?

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:32.342
Mature Bapu,
now I want to hear your story.

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:37.276
The King had three women...
what about you?

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.411
Tell me Bapu!

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:49.222
The simplicity you both have
is your biggest award Kanhaiya.

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:52.589
Tomorrow is the coronation...

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.699
since you've helped me so far,
please help a few days more...

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:59.928
until we find the Prince.

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:06.344
If possible, return these siblings
their childhood...

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:13.676
shower some of your love on them too.

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:22.854
The royal honour is now
in your hands Prem Dilwale!

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:34.502
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.632
Glory to Princess Maithili!

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.937
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.979
Glory to Princess Maithili!

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:42.946
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:45.142
Glory to Princess Maithili!

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:47.446
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.886
Glory to Princess Maithili!

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:03.691
These two here? During the coronation?

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:08.468
Sir I've heard that this imposter
is giving them this palace today.

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:09.332
What?

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:12.741
Calm down. Everyone will
get their share. Don't cry!

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.048
Chandrika?

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:21.143
I'll leave as soon as
my work is done uncle.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.084
Sit here!

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.628
Respected guests...

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:09.327
I've been bestowed with the responsibility
to officiate this historical event...

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:13.835
in a few moments,
the Prince will be crowned...

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:18.309
as per traditional
rituals and customs.

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:25.411
But before that I want
to read out the Prince's declaration.

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:33.380
'I want to apologize to all those...'

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:39.689
'...whom I have knowingly
or unknowingly hurt.'

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.862
'Every family has
misunderstandings...'

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:47.129
'...and when your own hurt you,
it's far more painful.'

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:51.565
'I can't bring back
the time that's passed...'

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.875
'...but I can share the pain.'

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:58.143
'And in order to share
my sisters' pain...'

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:03.149
'...I want to gift them
this palace!'

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:13.632
'Not just the palace, I would like to
share with my sisters...'

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:17.324
'...everything that I have inherited.'

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:22.872
'Mansions in London and Switzerland...'

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:25.000
'...the Esha Nagar farmhouses...'

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:28.636
'Properties, jewellery and factories.'

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:33.245
'All the legal
documents are here...'

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:36.352
'...let’s share everything together!'

01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:01.870
Chandrika,
now you have a share in everything...

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:06.346
as my share,
can I get my sister back?

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.421
You're right Chandrika...

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:20.295
brother, sister are just words.

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:25.031
What truly matters
is the brother sister bond...

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:28.471
which gives you every
right to get upset...

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:33.100
but no one can take
away my right to win you over.

01:44:39.172 --> 01:44:42.847
I've heard that as a child,
when I used to play cricket...

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:48.291
Chanda would insist on being
the first one to wish me good luck.

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.895
Remember Chanda?

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:56.100
And today when I'm
embarking on this journey...

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:58.727
to take the traditions
of this family forward...

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:03.570
won't you encourage me again Chanda?

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:53.790
If you still have any reservations...

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.520
then count me as an outsider.

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:09.507
"Happiness and sorrow
are not real."

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:15.704
"Wealth is not real either."

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:23.914
"And so are attachments."

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:36.798
"Real is the corner of the heart.."

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:44.767
"that treasures love."

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:51.311
"That treasures love."

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:33.247
"I have found love."

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:35.618
"I have found love."

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:37.987
"Love has brought him."

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.354
"Love has taken over me."

01:47:41.688 --> 01:47:42.792
"He has come."

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:45.196
"He sang."

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:47.564
"I have found love."

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:55.510
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:02.083
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

01:48:02.409 --> 01:48:06.858
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:11.623
"I have found love."

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:15.565
"I have found love."

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:18.000
"I have found
the treasure of love."

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.402
"I have found
the treasure of love."

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:22.800
"Our meeting seems inevitable."

01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:24.365
"I have found
the treasure of love."

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:30.341
"I have found
the treasure of love."

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:17.793
"Do I express or suppress my love?"

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:27.269
"I wonder why I feel so exited."

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:32.603
"Happiness is everywhere."

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:37.172
"I am blushing red."

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:41.875
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:46.687
"I have found love."

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:50.626
"I have found love."

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:53.061
"I have found the treasure of love."

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.429
"I have found the treasure of love."

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.695
"I am in seventh heaven."

01:49:57.891 --> 01:49:59.336
"Treasure of love."

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:05.369
"I have found the treasure of love."

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.635
"Love has taken over me."

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:10.106
"He has come."

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:12.544
"Love has brought him."

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.912
"He has come."

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:17.452
"Love has brought him."

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:19.548
"I have found love."

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:22.054
"Love has taken over me."

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.422
"He has come."

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:26.756
"Love has brought him."

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:29.159
"I have found love."

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.825
"I have found love."

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.866
There's some time for this too!

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.179
Listen.

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.115
How do I look?

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.692
<i>My god...</i>

01:50:54.748 --> 01:50:56.159
careful!

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:58.020
Here you go.

01:50:58.118 --> 01:51:00.689
If I knew you opened a
restaurant here every night...

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.266
then I would have
given you company.

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:03.323
What's the name of your restaurant?

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:06.200
- Prem Dilwala Restaurant.
- Nice name.

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:08.296
- What was the menu day before?
- Vegetable Curry.

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:11.340
- And yesterday?
- Baked peas.

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:14.106
- And today?
- Buttered Okra.

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:16.147
- Buttered Okra!
- Yes.

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:19.842
Sometimes you don't
act like a Princess.

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:23.581
Why? Have I become too
naughty these days? - No, no!

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:35.967
The thing is... when I'm happy
I become free!

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:40.834
But now I'll be a good girl.

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:44.033
- I want to eat okra too.
- No it's too spicy.

01:51:44.864 --> 01:51:47.538
'It's all in the mind!'

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:55.851
- Please sit up...
- Never!

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:58.518
We have to share everything.

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.494
We'll share everything...

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:14.197
highs and lows, ups and downs!

01:52:36.516 --> 01:52:40.157
- I want to drink water too.
- Right away.

01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:09.758
These lamps are complaining today...

01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:13.286
'Why hasn't the wedding
date been fixed yet?'

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:17.129
The couple doesn't
get to fix the date...

01:53:18.091 --> 01:53:20.537
your grandma will fix it.

01:53:27.033 --> 01:53:29.035
You know...

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:35.619
I sometimes get the feeling
that you're not the same man...

01:53:35.975 --> 01:53:38.182
that you're someone else...

01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:41.123
who's come from far away...

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:44.286
to take my loneliness away!

01:53:45.585 --> 01:53:47.531
But you know what...

01:53:48.454 --> 01:53:50.331
who cares...!

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:55.396
That day I made you write
several complaints...

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:59.534
today I'll speak again and you write...

01:54:00.166 --> 01:54:02.578
but this time on my back!

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:21.097
"Had it been
the night of our union.."

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:29.897
"I wonder
what would have happened."

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:40.950
"I wonder what would
have happened."

01:54:54.187 --> 01:54:59.967
"Love brings with it
a strange kind of yearning."

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:06.407
"A yearning evident
in the mind, body, and eyes."

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:12.043
"Darling, come to me."

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:21.317
"Darling, come to me.
I long for you."

01:55:21.881 --> 01:55:30.960
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:55:50.143 --> 01:55:52.953
There's no need to be
so reserved in love.

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:06.099
Queens used to get adorned here...

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:09.533
won't you adorn your Queen tonight?

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:25.878
"This kind of yearning
sometimes leads to destruction."

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:38.501
"A clean image gets marred."

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:51.147
"Examples of change of heart
are a many."

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:56.586
"Beautiful dreams make me yearn."

01:56:57.477 --> 01:57:03.018
"Yearning full of
need and indulgence."

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:11.794
"Come to me, darling.
I yearn for you."

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:21.904
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:32.955
Remember this place?

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:38.456
It's the same place
where I fought with you...

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:41.061
over something...

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:47.534
imagine that the same
barbecue is set up there...

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:52.972
I've worn your favourite
dress again...

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:54.568
and...

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:10.118
"Your love and affection
is not meant for me."

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:22.772
"Stop yourself
from getting attracted to me."

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:35.350
"Undeserved love will
take away peace of mind."

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:40.823
"Feel the yearning in my breath."

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:47.427
"The tinkling of my anklets and bangles
give away the yearning inside me."

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:50.432
"Come to me, darling."

01:58:53.359 --> 01:58:56.169
"I yearn for you."

01:58:56.596 --> 01:59:05.448
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:12.919
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:19.157
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:24.766
"I want to spend my life with you."

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:31.741
"I want to spend.."

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:36.075
"my life with you."

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:46.047
What if I tell you
I have no right to this?

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:55.064
The love I gave you in these
past four days was false, Princess.

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:21.918
Grandma says that true love resides
not on the lips... but in the eyes...

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:27.864
and your eyes are reflecting
your true love, Your Majesty!

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.768
Deewan Saheb!

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:43.937
Who is it?

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:55.548
Your Highness?

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:58.252
I'm back Deewan Saheb...

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:00.058
I'm back.

02:01:02.054 --> 02:01:03.658
Your Highness!

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:13.335
Dilwale?

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:18.106
Bapu, I can deceive you as the Prince...

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:23.250
but I can't deceive
the Princess anymore.

02:01:24.543 --> 02:01:32.223
Bapu, let the pride of the
royal family stay in the royal family.

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:38.562
Why did I come here to meet her?

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:40.638
Why did I stay here?

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:43.633
Why couldn't I understand this before?

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:48.368
Bapu, we must bring the Prince back.

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.649
- So you...?
- Sir.

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:56.082
What is it Sanjay?
Any news of the Prince?

02:01:56.142 --> 02:01:57.485
No sir.

02:01:57.777 --> 02:02:03.022
But there's someone who claims
he can take us to the Prince.

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:06.495
Happy Diwali Deewan Saheb.

02:02:08.254 --> 02:02:10.393
Prem Dilwale.

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.498
Prem Dilwala.

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:17.934
City Ayodhya.

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:20.343
Devotee of Lord Rama.

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.977
I must admit Deewan Saheb...

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:28.482
that even at this age
you did all this so cleverly.

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:31.077
But you made one mistake...

02:02:32.345 --> 02:02:39.490
you kept an 80 year old watchman
to take care of the Prince!

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:16.429
The effect of the injection
will last 3 to 4 hours. Take him away!

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:29.411
Congratulations Prem Dilwale.

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:32.244
Your desire is fulfilled.

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:36.047
Now the Princess can be yours.

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:40.579
The Princess can be yours.

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:43.827
Every loyal person
has the same fate.

02:03:45.384 --> 02:03:48.422
Get to the point.
Why have you come here?

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:53.368
I'll take Dilwale to the same
place where I'm holding the Prince.

02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:56.804
In exchange,
I want Chuttan's freedom.

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:58.373
And for one day tomorrow...

02:03:58.431 --> 02:04:02.345
I want Kanhaiya and
Dilwala in the same roles...

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.574
that you've had them play so far.

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:05.740
Why?

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:08.784
It's Diwali time Deewan Saheb.

02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:13.823
Let's play a few rounds of cards.
What do you say Dilwale?

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:19.396
Does Ajay know you're here?

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.824
What... Sanjay?

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:25.534
Get out of here!

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:27.962
You're one of Ajay's best friends...

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:30.165
at least don't deceive him!

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:33.402
Get out!
We don't accept your deal.

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:37.838
I'll come with you.

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:43.450
Allow me one more mistake
Deewan Saheb.

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:47.083
For the Princess' sake!

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:53.624
<i>Your Maps“?</i>

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:58.358
Vijav?

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:04.968
I’m going out to
get your wedding gift!'

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:27.894
Here's that Sheesh Mahal...

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:39.740
this is where Vijay
Singh is imprisoned.

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:43.541
Ajay is celebrating
Chuttan's freedom here.

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:48.151
Freedom!

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:52.847
Hey!

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.425
Someone else is here today...

02:06:01.487 --> 02:06:05.492
who wants to be a
part of your happiness.

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:10.163
Sir now that we've
achieved our goal...

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:13.137
what orders do
you have for this poor soul?

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:16.839
Deewan Saheb turned
him into a puppet.

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:41.194
Under my reign, no one has
to dance to anyone's tunes.

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.279
Sir.

02:06:55.107 --> 02:07:00.022
Sir to make today's victory
memorable, let's take a picture...

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:02.025
with you dressed in
the Late King's attire.

02:07:02.181 --> 02:07:05.890
I've got the dress here and
I've got a great photographer.

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.487
Mr. Masoorie!

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.064
- Greetings.
- Come on.

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:30.381
Follow me!

02:07:30.609 --> 02:07:34.250
I want to see these
two brothers battle.

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:36.020
Just like it's in the books.

02:07:36.181 --> 02:07:40.459
Whoever dies, one will
end up in the royal cemetery...

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:44.463
and the other will
be royally escorted to jail.

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:50.203
The Late King built this mirror
maze for his children to play in...

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:55.473
little did he know that one
day his lineage would end here.

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:18.059
This is Vijay Singh's fury...
eager to avenge every traitor!

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:26.109
Here's the key to his freedom...

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:31.743
if you can, save your Lord Rama
from committing a sin!

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:00.272
Raja Bhaiya!

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:09.810
'Congratulations Prem Dilwale!'

02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:12.014
'Now the Princess can be yours.'

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.954
'The Princess can be yours.'

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.855
'The Princess can be yours.'

02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:27.801
Dilwale... the Princess can be yours.

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:44.281
My not trusting you... means your death.

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:47.284
Aren't you scared of death?

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:51.525
If I had made a mistake... I
would be scared.

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:59.999
I've come to take you
back to your Princess...

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:01.966
where your sisters
are waiting for you...

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.672
your family is waiting for you.

02:10:05.798 --> 02:10:07.175
No!

02:10:07.432 --> 02:10:11.608
I have no family!
They're all selfish!

02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:15.847
A brother goes to meet his sister,
but she calls a lawyer!

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.979
A brother tries to kill his brother!

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:20.148
Is this what you call a family?

02:10:20.345 --> 02:10:22.416
I'll kill Ajay!

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:29.462
Why do you want to tarnish the
reputation of the princess' fiance?

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:37.269
Every family has problems...

02:10:37.496 --> 02:10:41.467
but blessed are
those who have a family!

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:44.579
Well said Dilwale!

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:47.116
But families also have a rule...

02:10:47.206 --> 02:10:51.086
the one at fault gets punished!

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:53.316
- Wait Raja Bhaiya!
- Enough!

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:58.618
For your sake I'll give Ajay Singh
an opportunity... to put up a fight!

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.730
RBI-i Bhaiya!

02:11:09.728 --> 02:11:11.435
Stop, Raja Bhaiya!

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:32.156
You managed to escape one maze...

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:36.666
but fate won't always favour you.

02:11:40.359 --> 02:11:43.363
Now no one can stop the battle!

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.244
Get up!

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:12.565
Get up Bhaisaheb!

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:55.606
Forgive me!

02:13:47.352 --> 02:13:51.926
"Friendship with brother,
fun with sisters."

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:56.496
"A heart like a kite in the sky."

02:13:56.595 --> 02:14:01.135
"All these were
relationships of the heart."

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:05.511
"With neither doubt nor jealousy."

02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:10.083
"There were no disagreements."

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:15.182
"Mirro, take me back
to my childhood."

02:14:54.152 --> 02:14:56.063
Raja Bhaiya, enough!

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:57.896
He's your brother.

02:14:57.989 --> 02:14:59.696
He's my enemy!

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:03.733
If that's so,
then excuse me.

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:25.718
Why such brotherly love for
your enemy, Raja Bhaiya?

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:35.102
If you hit it's a punishment.
But if someone else hits it's a crime.

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:38.207
This only happens in blood relations...

02:15:38.363 --> 02:15:40.070
in families.

02:15:41.199 --> 02:15:43.145
That's not true!

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:47.012
If that's not true...
then there's your brother...

02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:49.074
go kill him!

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:04.161
Raja Bhaiya, you're still
hiding your feelings...

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:06.461
why don't you tell your brother...

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:10.371
'I'm very lonely!
Let's go home.'

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:15.542
And you,
look into your brother's eyes!

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:21.144
Is it possible that he wouldn't
fulfill any of your desires?

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:25.982
You let the world convince you
to kill your own brother?

02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:31.523
All you siblings are
bound by the same link...

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:35.725
you're all looking for that same love
that you lost in this Sheesh Mahal...

02:16:35.787 --> 02:16:38.790
only your ways of looking are wrong!

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:40.929
Bhaiya!

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:12.618
What are you doing here?
Get lost!

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:15.424
Anyone else?

02:18:35.639 --> 02:18:39.679
How do brothers ask for
forgiveness, Bhaisaheb?

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:42.323
By hugging each other.

02:18:43.214 --> 02:18:47.526
Then hug me gently,
I'm in a lot of pain.

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:50.058
Come here!

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.284
It's not over yet Your Highness!

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:24.689
'Imagine that I've worn your
favourite dress again... and...'

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:06.598
You can go in Princess.

02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:11.265
To the one, who truly belongs to you.

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:20.616
Forgive me, but the one you
were spending time with so far...

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:22.716
had been planted by me.

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:13.063
The old wounds have healed completely.

02:22:13.258 --> 02:22:19.265
Now His Majesty needs
to eat and rest well.

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:23.207
- Goodnight sir.
- Goodnight Doctor.

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:40.926
I am sorry that you had
to go through this embarrassment.

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.364
Thank you!

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:52.308
Your Majesty,
Dilwala is here to see you.

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.109
Just a second.

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:02.381
You want to go inside for a bit?

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:05.254
Thank you.

02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:09.518
Deewan Saheb, send him in.

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:22.169
Your Majesty, before anyone
discovers our secret...

02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.966
Dilwala has come to take your leave.

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:32.503
Okay... Papa's car will go drop him
Deewan Saheb.

02:23:32.604 --> 02:23:33.674
Yes.

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:36.076
Goodbye Sir.

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:44.649
Dilwale,
you've broken many traditions...

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:47.959
you made the royal
guests play football....

02:23:48.052 --> 02:23:52.194
you told everyone that I
used to bathe naked in the lake!

02:23:55.627 --> 02:23:58.699
And you didn't keep
a moustache either...

02:24:00.031 --> 02:24:01.374
why?

02:24:02.567 --> 02:24:06.674
Sir, it made your Princess happy!

02:24:12.877 --> 02:24:17.485
Thank you... I can't
stop you from leaving...

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:22.095
but tell me, what can I do for you.

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:27.730
You're a very good son...

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:30.197
you're a very good brother...

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:33.772
can't you be that companion...

02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:38.774
that the Princess
is looking for in you?

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:48.488
Okay, I will try my best.

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.561
Raja Bhaiya, one more request...

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:58.931
Kanhaiya!

02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:01.800
- Give me this...
- No this one.

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:11.211
We had brought these
gifts for the Princess, will you...

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:12.780
Sure.

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:07.960
Bapu, I'll take your leave.

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:15.041
Do visit us some day... for quality time!

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:23.584
And Bapu you didn't
answer that question.

02:26:23.674 --> 02:26:27.850
You can tell me today...
I'm leaving and there's nobody around.

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:37.332
While taking care of the royal family,
I didn't get any time...

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:43.795
Now if you ask anything else
I'll slap you!

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:58.481
Go away from here... go!

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.697
Sit.

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:44.258
"You are as enchanting as
all the scriptures put together."

02:27:48.292 --> 02:27:56.074
"A symbol of virtue and truth,
just like Sita."

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:48.092
Oh!!

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:52.161
New drama?

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:55.098
Come friends.

02:28:55.259 --> 02:28:58.433
Take your seats... faster!

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:01.401
Dear friends...

02:29:01.666 --> 02:29:07.344
early morning Lord Vishnu
visited me in my dream!

02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:10.345
He said 'Chaubey... hey Chaubey!'

02:29:11.042 --> 02:29:12.680
'Become pure.'

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:16.725
And he also said that...

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:22.526
'Chaubey you should stay
in touch with the rich and famous!'

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:25.157
So why don't you invite
the King here sometime?

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:28.303
Or better still, take me there...

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:30.396
for tea...

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:33.570
- Om!
- No!

02:29:33.731 --> 02:29:35.335
Oh!

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:37.674
Chaubey uncle.

02:29:37.868 --> 02:29:41.873
Prem Bhaiya,
Grandma from the royal family is here...

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:52.656
Grandma!

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:15.444
In all these years I've never
seen such a blissful Diwali.

02:30:15.506 --> 02:30:17.508
The royal family of Pritampur...

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:22.614
is joyfully celebrating
unique festivities...

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:24.853
all because of you!

02:30:28.252 --> 02:30:31.392
You've given us this gift...

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:35.127
and there is a tradition
in our royal families...

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:39.698
we give a gift
in exchange of a gift!

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:18.070
Dilwale.

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:22.580
We fought a lot after
we got engaged...

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:26.017
we tried to humiliate each other.

02:31:26.077 --> 02:31:32.494
But after you left, I tried
to be the one you asked me to be...

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:42.461
and I said nothing to
her, nor did I interrupt her...

02:31:43.094 --> 02:31:45.404
just listened.

02:31:45.763 --> 02:31:49.301
And we both came to
the conclusion that...

02:31:50.134 --> 02:31:55.641
the companion that our Princess
has been looking for...

02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:58.677
is our very own Dilwala.

02:31:59.143 --> 02:32:01.020
Prem Dilwala!

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:09.222
The Princess belongs
to the royal family.

02:32:09.286 --> 02:32:11.698
If the royal family
is what's separating us...

02:32:11.755 --> 02:32:15.703
then you'll have to
include us in your family today.

02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:21.266
As you know, I don't know
how to talk filmy nor do I like it...

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.572
but I'm still trying.

02:32:23.968 --> 02:32:28.383
Two days after Diwali,
today is Bhaidooj (BROTHER'S DAY)...

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:32.076
we’ll celebrate it this year!

02:33:14.218 --> 02:33:16.425
Sisters celebrate this festival...

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:20.292
but it's called Brother's Day...

02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:29.041
this brother too wants to be
a part of your family!

02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:39.013
Our families are no longer separate...

02:33:39.076 --> 02:33:43.286
we are now one family...
which Prem has brought together!

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:46.650
Any other order?

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:58.405
"My heart beats faster."

02:34:00.297 --> 02:34:04.006
"My heart is racing."

02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:23.356
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he likes."

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:29.132
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

02:34:31.962 --> 02:34:37.640
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he likes."

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:43.447
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

02:34:45.909 --> 02:34:51.484
"Let me buy something sweet
and spicy, something he likes."

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:57.123
"Let me buy some
snacks and confectionary."

02:34:57.621 --> 02:35:03.196
"I have to say it to him today."

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:08.869
"I have to say it to him today."

02:35:15.839 --> 02:35:17.375
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:35:17.741 --> 02:35:20.517
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:24.457
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:29.923
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:34.333
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:38.765
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:44.377
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:36:01.719 --> 02:36:10.867
"Darkness was all around me.
My dear ones were far away."

02:36:11.562 --> 02:36:20.482
"I know now the value of
dreams and relationships."

02:36:21.105 --> 02:36:25.815
"I understand love now."

02:36:25.909 --> 02:36:30.153
"Nobody cared for me
like you did."

02:36:30.447 --> 02:36:34.953
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:39.660
"I have found love."

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:43.637
"I have found love."

02:36:43.827 --> 02:36:46.103
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:36:46.163 --> 02:36:48.473
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:36:48.532 --> 02:36:52.378
"I feel overwhelmed
that I have found love."

02:36:53.303 --> 02:36:58.582
"I have found the treasure of love."

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:00.611
"He conquered."

02:37:01.979 --> 02:37:03.151
"He came."

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:05.420
"He brought love."

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:07.787
"I have found love."

02:37:09.019 --> 02:37:10.498
"I have found love."

02:37:10.522 --> 02:37:26.522
