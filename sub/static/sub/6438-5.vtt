00:03.154 --> 00:04.822
<i>You have given Caesar mission?</i>

00:04.889 --> 00:06.957
<i>He secrets himself among the rebels.</i>

00:07.025 --> 00:10.093
Greater glory than
the death of your enemy.

00:10.161 --> 00:12.262
Advance!

00:12.330 --> 00:14.531
I ordered them to stand
ground but they fled.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.567
What punishment would
you have me inflict?

00:16.635 --> 00:17.868
Decimation.

00:17.936 --> 00:20.671
Fifty men, fifty stones.

00:20.739 --> 00:25.442
<i>Five stained with the promise of death.</i>

00:25.510 --> 00:28.278
See this last thing that
I ask of you to its end,

00:28.346 --> 00:31.314
and I will fill your ship
with all the riches

00:31.382 --> 00:32.816
this city yet holds.

00:32.884 --> 00:34.317
Let us see it done then brother.

00:34.385 --> 00:37.821
<i>Spartacus, Crixus and</i>
<i>the others have gone mad.</i>

00:37.888 --> 00:39.222
<i>Get your weapons,</i>

00:39.290 --> 00:41.158
Keep watch over the Cilicians.

00:41.225 --> 00:42.993
You seem you favor
their fucking company.

00:43.895 --> 00:45.562
You will regain sense.

00:45.630 --> 00:48.098
It is you who has lost sense.

00:48.166 --> 00:50.601
Yet I now doubt path he travels.

00:50.668 --> 00:53.337
Then perhaps the time has come,

00:53.405 --> 00:55.506
to forge our own.

02:13.056 --> 02:14.496
See them cleaned of blood and salted,

02:14.523 --> 02:16.791
to hold rot at length.

02:16.859 --> 02:19.094
They maybe yet some purpose.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.434
<i>Agron.</i>

02:26.502 --> 02:27.735
I would share a moment.

02:27.803 --> 02:30.438
I have no time nor desire.

02:30.506 --> 02:32.973
Perhaps Castus is less taken.

03:04.470 --> 03:07.972
I do not care for the way
his eyes frame upon you.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.441
A gaze I grew familiar with

03:10.509 --> 03:12.410
when we were yet slaves to Batiatus.

03:12.477 --> 03:14.078
I fear return to days of old.

03:19.884 --> 03:21.117
There are many who believe
Crixus holds higher ground,

03:21.185 --> 03:23.019
with the slaughtering of the prisoners.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.960
And where do you stand, in such regard?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.035
With you.

03:40.102 --> 03:43.705
And always shall upon field of battle.

03:53.314 --> 03:55.281
Return to the villa.

03:55.349 --> 03:58.317
I would have guard Laeta
and her people in my absence.

03:58.385 --> 03:59.506
Is it wise leaving city walls

03:59.553 --> 04:01.354
with so much unsettled within them?

04:04.091 --> 04:05.091
Should you not attempt words

04:05.159 --> 04:10.863
and the healing of festering wound?

04:10.931 --> 04:12.965
I'm done with words.

04:16.002 --> 04:19.605
[ indistinct conversation ]

04:19.673 --> 04:21.507
Oh, you must learn our tongue.

04:21.575 --> 04:25.011
You know what cruses she rains upon you.

04:25.079 --> 04:27.180
[ speaking German ]

04:30.852 --> 04:33.220
I prefer the bliss of ignorance.

04:33.288 --> 04:35.756
As all men should, huh.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.996
We break for Sicilia,
and the promise of blood.

04:42.063 --> 04:43.397
It is ill time for drink.

04:43.465 --> 04:46.133
I but lend support to brother Lugo.

04:47.602 --> 04:49.002
I fear the water.

04:49.070 --> 04:52.472
And the monsters within it.

04:52.539 --> 04:55.141
All has been prepared for
your voyage, King Spartacus.

04:55.208 --> 04:59.778
As agreed upon.

04:59.846 --> 05:02.747
With many times its weight to follow.

05:06.118 --> 05:07.653
More than enough
for wine--

05:07.720 --> 05:10.656
and for soft lips around you cock huh,

05:10.723 --> 05:14.426
to remove lingering thoughts
of the Syrian boy.

05:14.494 --> 05:17.296
You do not sail with us?

05:17.363 --> 05:19.597
Heracleo is for more pressing matters.

05:19.665 --> 05:21.466
I paid for your services.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.201
You paid for my ship.

05:23.268 --> 05:24.435
And who shall helm it?

05:24.503 --> 05:29.239
That is what I pay Tryphon for.

05:29.307 --> 05:32.609
Good fortune, King Spartacus.

05:32.676 --> 05:39.015
I shall raise a cup in your honor.

05:39.082 --> 05:40.158
Come Captain.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.627
[ laughter ]

06:10.180 --> 06:14.016
<i>Let this night be forever remembered.</i>

06:15.285 --> 06:16.385
Begin!

06:33.038 --> 06:41.014
You wish to fight now?

06:41.081 --> 06:47.554
Where was such lust for blood
when stood against Spartacus?

06:47.622 --> 06:53.328
We are mired in piss
and shit because of you.

06:53.396 --> 06:56.097
Because you turned and fled
like frightened children

06:56.165 --> 07:00.570
in the face of our enemy.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.974
It is cruelest fate that
you yet draw breath.

07:04.042 --> 07:06.977
While the man who stood ground beside me

07:07.045 --> 07:08.545
was struck from this world

07:08.613 --> 07:10.547
for your fucking cowardice!

07:17.388 --> 07:19.990
[ horn blows ]

07:39.780 --> 07:42.281
I would not have our stores fall
below reasonable note.

07:42.349 --> 07:44.817
See more grain brought
from holdings in Sicilia.

07:44.885 --> 07:46.453
Imperator.

07:50.525 --> 07:52.125
Senator Metellus.

07:52.193 --> 07:53.961
Apologies for lack of proper reception.

07:54.029 --> 07:56.263
I was unaware you'd strayed so far

07:56.331 --> 07:58.499
from the comforts of mother Rome.

07:58.566 --> 07:59.733
I seek neither vain formality

07:59.801 --> 08:01.435
nor luxurious appointment.

08:02.704 --> 08:05.005
Only answer to singular question,

08:05.073 --> 08:06.574
why did the Senate granted you an army

08:06.642 --> 08:08.042
only for it to stand idle

08:08.110 --> 08:12.047
half day's march from Sinuessa?

08:12.115 --> 08:13.582
The Senate did not grant me an army.

08:13.650 --> 08:16.118
They granted command.

08:16.186 --> 08:18.321
Every horse, every sword,
every man your eye lays upon

08:18.388 --> 08:22.024
was purchased with coin
from my own vaults.

08:22.091 --> 08:23.592
Shall be set to purpose by the will

08:23.660 --> 08:25.694
of Marcus Crassus alone.

08:25.762 --> 08:27.763
And was it your will that
sounded retreat against

08:27.831 --> 08:30.533
Spartacus in inaugural confrontation?

08:30.601 --> 08:32.402
You were dispatched to balm

08:32.470 --> 08:33.903
grievous wound suffered against him.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.205
Not to inflict further injury

08:35.273 --> 08:36.940
with such unfortunate news.

08:37.008 --> 08:40.744
A minor skirmish foolishly engaged.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.746
Those who turned from their
duty have been dealt with.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.149
News that also inflames ear.

08:45.216 --> 08:47.819
Is it true you exhume
putrid spectre of decimation?

08:48.988 --> 08:52.224
I but give needed lesson in commitment.

08:52.291 --> 08:54.493
When next my soldiers face Spartacus

08:54.560 --> 08:57.929
it shall be the rebel
who falls to misfortune.

08:57.997 --> 08:59.197
The people shall greet such event

08:59.265 --> 09:01.567
with celebration.

09:01.634 --> 09:04.570
As they greet word of Pompey's
victory in Hispania.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.541
He has defeated Sertorius?

09:09.609 --> 09:11.176
And soon shall be once
again upon our shores

09:11.244 --> 09:12.544
with his own legions.

09:13.580 --> 09:14.980
It shall be of a comfort...

09:15.048 --> 09:18.250
if Spartacus yet plagues us.

09:18.318 --> 09:21.287
Spartacus shall be far from thought

09:21.354 --> 09:24.090
in advance of the
adolescent butcher's return.

09:24.158 --> 09:26.459
Your tongue rattles bold noise.

09:26.527 --> 09:28.929
But here you sit absent
thunder and purpose.

09:30.765 --> 09:33.100
What would you have me do?

09:33.167 --> 09:36.270
Hurtle myself against
city walls in mad attempt.

09:36.338 --> 09:39.307
I would have you bring
this to an end, Imperator.

09:40.142 --> 09:42.544
A thing already set to motion.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.882
Caesar is within Sinnuessa,

09:47.950 --> 09:49.384
secreted among the rebels.

09:49.451 --> 09:50.985
Caesar?

09:51.053 --> 09:52.387
You would place our fate

09:52.454 --> 09:54.789
in the hands of that
arrogant fucking boy?

09:54.857 --> 09:56.491
Spartacus will not be put to grass

09:56.559 --> 10:00.362
by brute force, as Pompey
would surely attempt.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.364
He's a man of keen intellect,

10:02.432 --> 10:04.033
and must be dealt with in kind.

10:04.101 --> 10:07.403
You speak as though you admire the man.

10:07.471 --> 10:09.172
He came from humble beginnings,

10:09.239 --> 10:13.076
and now even the Senate
trembles before him.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.679
I find no greater cause for admiration.

10:15.746 --> 10:17.748
The Senate does not
tremble--

10:17.815 --> 10:20.217
except in anger that you fail to act.

10:21.886 --> 10:26.823
I but wait for proper opportunity.

10:26.890 --> 10:30.426
Yet if a small force
advanced upon above Sinuessa

10:30.494 --> 10:32.328
would assuage fear...

10:32.396 --> 10:33.929
How many men?

10:33.997 --> 10:36.265
How many did you travel with?

10:39.102 --> 10:41.904
You would seek to order my men
to do what you will not?

10:41.972 --> 10:44.439
I would seek to include you
in glorious victory.

10:44.507 --> 10:47.610
If thought does not appeal, return home.

10:47.677 --> 10:51.192
And leave matters of war
to the men who wage them.

11:05.295 --> 11:06.662
You give me sword?

11:06.729 --> 11:10.565
You've proven yourself
trusted, Lyciscus.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.300
And I would see you well armed,

11:12.368 --> 11:14.636
were another attempt made upon my life.

11:14.704 --> 11:16.738
Gratitude.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.374
I long to see it put to proper use.

11:19.442 --> 11:20.875
As do I.

11:20.943 --> 11:22.777
A desire well shared.

11:22.844 --> 11:26.848
Soon we shall throw open gate,

11:26.916 --> 11:30.418
and split Roman ass
with cocks hard of purpose.

11:32.454 --> 11:34.355
What of Spartacus?

11:34.423 --> 11:36.691
Will he return from voyage
upon sea to join us?

11:36.758 --> 11:39.093
Spartacus is no longer among us?

11:39.161 --> 11:40.128
I was down at the docks when he departed

11:40.195 --> 11:42.330
with Gannicus and the Cilicians.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.498
You did not know of this?

11:44.566 --> 11:45.699
No. I did not.

11:45.767 --> 11:48.168
He protects the fuckin' Romans.

11:48.236 --> 11:50.671
And now treads water with
Heracleo, absent word?

11:50.739 --> 11:52.539
Heracleo does not sail with them.

11:52.607 --> 11:54.375
He remains in Sinuessa?

11:54.443 --> 11:57.011
With his man Castus.

11:57.078 --> 12:00.114
They are for drink, and baser pleasures.

12:00.181 --> 12:02.049
And what of Agron?

12:02.116 --> 12:03.484
Was he stroking Spartacus' cock

12:03.551 --> 12:04.919
when ship set to wave?

12:04.986 --> 12:06.020
I didn't see him.

12:09.558 --> 12:14.128
Seek Heracleo, and gain
knowledge upon subject.

12:14.195 --> 12:15.796
We will have words
have words with Agron.

12:18.366 --> 12:20.300
The fucking chasm widens.

12:31.311 --> 12:33.712
Gratitude, for the food.

12:33.780 --> 12:37.449
And the protection you
provide my people.

12:37.517 --> 12:39.185
I do only as commanded.

12:39.252 --> 12:41.620
It is still a kindness,

12:41.688 --> 12:42.888
much appreciated.

12:42.956 --> 12:45.791
She fuckin' appreciates us.

12:52.866 --> 12:55.602
You and your people

12:55.669 --> 13:00.639
would have us all for the afterlife.

13:00.707 --> 13:03.576
As we would have you.

13:06.280 --> 13:12.018
But for the mercy of Spartacus.

13:12.085 --> 13:14.821
Give way or see brains upon the ground.

13:14.889 --> 13:16.523
Turn from whatever
intentions cloud mind.

13:16.590 --> 13:18.625
You will not lay hands
upon these people!

13:18.692 --> 13:23.263
We give no fuck towards your Roman pets.

13:23.331 --> 13:26.433
Why has Spartacus left the city?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.540
Where did you hear of this?

13:27.602 --> 13:29.336
Give fucking answer.

13:29.403 --> 13:31.972
Seek it from the man himself
upon his return.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.476
I thought more of Spartacus,
than a coward

13:35.543 --> 13:38.479
of secrets and schemes.

13:38.546 --> 13:41.048
As you schemed to slaughter these
Romans against his command?

13:41.116 --> 13:43.284
They are the enemy.

13:43.351 --> 13:46.154
No different to the ones we
suffered beneath as slaves.

13:49.558 --> 13:54.863
Or the ones who took
your brother's life.

13:54.931 --> 13:57.466
There stood a time when you
followed your own heart

13:57.533 --> 13:59.334
in matters of blood.

13:59.402 --> 14:01.403
What does it tell you?

14:10.546 --> 14:12.781
That we are different men now.

14:17.654 --> 14:19.688
Not all of us.

14:22.759 --> 14:26.062
Let Spartacus know I will have
words, when he returns.

14:38.975 --> 14:41.543
[ yelling and indistinct conversations ]

14:50.119 --> 14:53.521
I have born witness to
many of your mad plans.

14:53.589 --> 14:57.124
Never did I believe they
would lead us across the seas.

14:57.192 --> 15:00.395
Last I found myself upon them,
I was in chains.

15:02.164 --> 15:03.431
Bound for Roman soil.

15:03.499 --> 15:05.466
My wife taken from me.

15:05.534 --> 15:07.903
A thing they shall eternally regret.

15:07.970 --> 15:11.640
Of that I have no doubt.

15:11.708 --> 15:12.708
Yet of current intentions,

15:12.742 --> 15:16.812
my mind is of less certainty.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.148
Crixus runs wild within the city,

15:19.215 --> 15:22.051
Crassus threatens growing storm without.

15:22.118 --> 15:25.521
Time ill considered for assault
towards wheat in Sicilia.

15:25.588 --> 15:30.626
Heracelo tells of shipments
large in the gathering.

15:30.694 --> 15:33.396
I would sever a blow to the man himself,

15:33.464 --> 15:34.497
not his purse.

15:34.565 --> 15:36.866
The food is meant to feed his army.

15:36.934 --> 15:39.536
Seizing it will aid in weak them,

15:39.604 --> 15:42.139
and force Crassus to fall
to desired path.

15:42.206 --> 15:43.306
Point well made.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.845
One perhaps you would
divine absent my words,

15:47.912 --> 15:49.647
were head not forever steeped in wine.

15:49.714 --> 15:51.982
(laughs)

15:52.050 --> 15:54.151
A man must do what he can
to brace he can embrace

15:54.219 --> 15:56.287
against the shit of a simple day.

15:56.354 --> 15:59.423
I hold you towards loftier esteem.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.859
As would most loyal to our cause...

16:01.926 --> 16:03.227
if I were to fall.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.965
You know my thoughts
towards the subject.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.800
I am no leader.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.336
You proved yourself
more one than Crixus,

16:12.404 --> 16:14.439
when streets unfortunate
with unfortunate blood.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.341
Had Naevia not put me to ground,

16:16.408 --> 16:19.111
I may have spilt the same.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.179
No.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.347
You would not have.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.687
They come to land.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.791
And blood of fucking Romans.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.834
Perhaps one day you will find
reason closer to heart,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.238
to assume deserved mantle.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.940
And perhaps I will fall this very night.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.677
And leave you to weep
with the other women.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.421
<i>Keep formation!</i>

17:07.926 --> 17:09.728
<i>[ yelling ]</i>

17:46.998 --> 17:48.899
You wish to leave us?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.234
Sanus will send you on your way!

18:00.043 --> 18:03.012
Crassus well provides us.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.547
No escape.

18:04.615 --> 18:06.216
All dead.

18:06.283 --> 18:09.119
Let us see what more
he has to offer this night.

18:27.739 --> 18:31.475
<i>I look into his eyes, and no
longer gaze upon the boy I knew.</i>

18:31.542 --> 18:36.079
I have witnessed cold distance
in his stare.

18:36.147 --> 18:38.382
You should break words
and draw him near,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.250
where he belongs.

18:40.318 --> 18:43.387
Nothing do I crave more.

18:43.454 --> 18:45.322
Yet he has to find his own path,

18:45.390 --> 18:48.458
or be forever lost.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.227
Of course.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.363
I speak my heart, absent thought.

18:53.431 --> 18:56.667
It weighs heavy, seeing
one so loved cast adrift.

18:56.735 --> 19:00.070
I can offer him no light
upon welcoming shore.

19:03.842 --> 19:10.247
Yet you may appear as
bright as the North Star,

19:11.316 --> 19:13.418
constant in its guidance.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.756
I'd do anything to ease the suffering

19:17.824 --> 19:20.960
of both son, and noble father.

19:28.568 --> 19:32.103
When you are within my arms,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.706
the world falls from concern.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.841
You will forever find me there.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.611
Until the gods tumble from the heavens.

20:28.763 --> 20:32.199
At last the fucking dice from favor.

20:32.267 --> 20:36.403
I shall see balance of what
you have stolen returned.

20:36.471 --> 20:41.742
I shall see balance of wine
drained from cock.

20:42.744 --> 20:45.580
The night is young
and so are the whores.

20:45.647 --> 20:50.051
Linger, see both properly aged.

20:50.119 --> 20:52.888
Another game, then.

20:52.956 --> 20:55.524
I came about winnings easily,

20:55.592 --> 20:57.726
I would part with them hard.

20:59.029 --> 21:02.564
Would that all profited
so in dealings with Spartacus.

21:02.632 --> 21:07.703
I fear blood soon to
replace desired coin,

21:07.770 --> 21:12.407
when news meets of the rebel
king's madness in Sicilia.

21:12.475 --> 21:15.311
It is a thing to trouble thoughts.

21:15.378 --> 21:18.681
And Spartacus commanding your ship,

21:18.748 --> 21:23.352
forcing you to shore as he sails
towards uncertain fortune.

21:23.420 --> 21:26.889
A decision made of own fucking mind,

21:26.956 --> 21:30.559
absent cracks threatening foundation.

21:30.627 --> 21:33.830
To set upon holdings of the richest man

21:33.897 --> 21:36.466
in all the Republic

21:36.534 --> 21:41.572
is invitation for calamity and collapse.

21:41.639 --> 21:45.042
Spartacus moves against
Crassus on Sicilia?

21:45.110 --> 21:48.512
I would clear head and cock,

21:48.580 --> 21:52.083
before more piss flows
from errant tongue.

21:52.151 --> 21:53.718
<i>Move my darling.</i>

21:53.786 --> 21:55.420
<i>Come on.</i>

21:55.487 --> 21:58.589
I think Crixus would be
eager to learn this.

22:01.793 --> 22:03.594
Pause.

22:03.661 --> 22:08.165
Let us see what more can
be drawn from Cilician waters.

22:08.233 --> 22:09.933
I was of similar mind.

22:23.582 --> 22:25.116
You must eat.

22:27.186 --> 22:30.189
The man resents we yet draw breath.

22:30.257 --> 22:32.825
You do not stand object
of his displeasure.

22:34.628 --> 22:36.329
Agron. Pause a moment.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.596
Spartacus is due upon docks.

22:37.664 --> 22:38.697
I would greet his return.

22:38.765 --> 22:40.333
And I would have much need of words.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.535
I yet have none to break.

22:42.602 --> 22:44.482
Is it a common trait among
men east of the Rhine

22:44.504 --> 22:47.373
to run from a fight?

22:47.441 --> 22:49.375
No.

22:49.443 --> 22:51.043
Yet I have learned it one
of a Syrian to shit

22:51.111 --> 22:52.912
lies from mouth and deem
them sweetest nectar.

22:52.946 --> 22:54.113
I have not broken trust with you.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.447
You were with Castus.

22:55.515 --> 22:58.283
After I commanded you
remain absent his company.

22:58.351 --> 23:00.352
Commanded?

23:00.420 --> 23:03.355
The collar that once bound
my neck is but distant memory.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.891
Do not think I will slip it
'round again for you.

23:05.959 --> 23:08.060
Do not raise fucking hackle.

23:08.128 --> 23:09.528
If I had been discovered
with the Cilician

23:09.596 --> 23:11.964
after promises made to you,
you would be of equal passion.

23:12.032 --> 23:13.272
I came upon Castus in the street

23:13.333 --> 23:16.102
while Crixus and the others
were seized with madness.

23:16.169 --> 23:17.369
We broke for you and Spartacus,

23:17.371 --> 23:21.807
absent time even for words
to pass between us.

23:21.875 --> 23:25.545
And I am to believe
of all within the city

23:25.612 --> 23:27.780
he miraculously appears by your side?

23:27.848 --> 23:29.849
As I would believe you.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.186
In all things.

23:34.855 --> 23:38.324
Agron, we have a fuckin' problem.

23:41.861 --> 23:44.363
<i>How many crest hill?</i>

23:44.431 --> 23:46.098
Thirty by count.

23:46.166 --> 23:48.901
Perhaps more concealed by dawn's mist.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.169
Scouts.

23:50.236 --> 23:53.038
Their numbers stand to few for advance.

23:57.477 --> 24:04.082
Soon they shall swell,
their legions crashing upon us.

24:04.150 --> 24:06.084
Then perhaps we should send message

24:06.152 --> 24:08.353
of the folly of such an attempt.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.289
Gather weapons,
and prepare to open gate!

24:12.357 --> 24:13.724
[ cheering ]

24:13.792 --> 24:16.293
Spartacus would not allow
foolish attack on Crassus.

24:16.361 --> 24:19.830
Whilst he lays assault
on the man in Sicilia?

24:19.898 --> 24:22.533
He moves towards Crassus,

24:22.600 --> 24:24.702
and yet we're to sit here stoking cock.

24:26.171 --> 24:29.539
Let us show Crassus that
all the coin in the world

24:29.607 --> 24:32.876
will not stay his blood
upon fucking ground!

24:35.046 --> 24:39.015
You do not lead these people.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.284
Perhaps it's time I should.

24:42.987 --> 24:44.554
<i>Crixus!</i>

24:49.726 --> 24:51.727
Why are you assembled
with rising intent?

24:51.795 --> 24:54.830
To meet those of Rome,
gathered upon hill.

24:54.898 --> 24:58.134
He's given order to throw open gate.

24:58.202 --> 24:59.435
I would see it opened as well.

24:59.503 --> 25:02.038
[ cheering ]

25:02.106 --> 25:04.006
At last he falls to fucking reason.

25:04.074 --> 25:08.010
Well you mistake me.

25:08.078 --> 25:10.646
I do not give command to
see Crassus' men engaged.

25:10.714 --> 25:12.948
Then what moves purpose?

25:13.016 --> 25:16.352
I would see what remains
of our Roman guests released.

25:16.419 --> 25:18.587
[ murmuring ]

25:20.656 --> 25:22.090
You set them free?

25:22.158 --> 25:23.558
You have lost fucking mind.

25:23.626 --> 25:27.596
As you have lost voice
in all decisions of worth.

25:31.701 --> 25:36.504
Attempt to raise gate
in advance of my word.

25:36.572 --> 25:40.108
And you will find it
forever shut behind you.

26:09.904 --> 26:11.838
It seems another life.

26:11.906 --> 26:13.140
When we were embraced by the warmth

26:13.208 --> 26:16.443
of your father's villa.

26:16.511 --> 26:18.946
For some a place of each chill.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.150
When last did food pass lips?

26:23.218 --> 26:25.085
A thing of no care.

26:25.153 --> 26:27.921
To me nothing stands more so.

26:27.989 --> 26:29.690
Let us fall to the comfort of my tent,

26:29.757 --> 26:31.758
and turn from unforgiving ground.

26:34.829 --> 26:37.264
I remain with my men.

26:37.332 --> 26:40.401
As the Imperator would have it.

26:40.468 --> 26:45.873
Your father cares for you
more than you know.

26:45.940 --> 26:49.710
His hand offered
through touch of my own.

26:52.014 --> 26:54.281
You come to me upon his order?

26:54.349 --> 26:57.317
He has chosen to make gesture.

26:57.385 --> 26:59.787
Just as you must choose
how it is received.

27:19.807 --> 27:21.675
What of your men that set upon us?

27:21.742 --> 27:23.610
They now stand willing to see us live?

27:23.678 --> 27:28.682
They are no longer my men,
nor stand for reason.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.785
I will see you from the city,

27:30.852 --> 27:32.586
and far from their wrath.

27:32.654 --> 27:34.622
Would you have come to such compassion

27:34.690 --> 27:36.657
in advance of unfortunate events.

27:36.725 --> 27:38.492
We've both been deeply wounded by them.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.594
You have suffered but annoying scratch.

27:40.662 --> 27:41.662
Do not seek to place it upon level

27:41.730 --> 27:42.863
with severed fucking limb.

27:42.931 --> 27:44.932
I seek nothing, except
the parting of ways.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.002
From you, and those who would
break from my command.

27:50.472 --> 27:53.341
You forced Crixus and
the other from Sinuessa?

27:53.409 --> 27:55.744
They'd remain within cursed walls.

27:55.811 --> 27:58.446
I am for Sicilia with those yet loyal

27:58.514 --> 28:00.081
and points beyond.

28:00.149 --> 28:02.517
The mighty Spartacus.

28:02.585 --> 28:04.353
Turning from noble cause.

28:04.420 --> 28:07.122
I but choose another path.

28:07.190 --> 28:11.661
One slick with blood, as any you travel.

28:11.729 --> 28:13.463
One Rome set me upon.

28:13.530 --> 28:16.499
Be thankful I leave its shores.

28:16.567 --> 28:20.069
And pray to your gods I never return.

28:21.471 --> 28:23.339
[ crowd yelling ]

28:28.546 --> 28:29.512
<i>Move them back.</i>

28:29.580 --> 28:31.314
Move! Stay back!

28:34.351 --> 28:36.787
We shall have your blood upon a day!

28:42.059 --> 28:45.969
You are blessed because
Spartacus stands a fool.

28:52.236 --> 28:53.904
Move aside.

29:29.176 --> 29:30.342
You put us all at risk!

29:30.410 --> 29:32.311
I but move more to victory!

29:32.379 --> 29:34.113
By setting our enemies to the winds?

29:34.180 --> 29:35.514
You place wrath upon errant hem.

29:35.582 --> 29:37.216
Crassus stands truer enemy.

29:37.284 --> 29:39.852
And you deliver weapon
into waiting hands.

29:39.919 --> 29:42.154
Laeta and the others have
been among us too long.

29:42.222 --> 29:44.790
What they might
have heard or laid eyes--

29:44.858 --> 29:47.492
They laid eyes on two brothers divided.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.428
A chasm we must bridge.

29:49.495 --> 29:51.596
One widen by your schemes in Sicilia.

29:51.664 --> 29:54.166
A thing Crassus will believe as well.

29:54.234 --> 29:56.001
When Laeta tells him of it.

29:58.972 --> 30:03.341
You release her, so he
will know of your plans?

30:03.409 --> 30:05.477
And when he moves to halt them...

30:05.544 --> 30:08.513
We shall see the man
and his legions to their end.

30:13.619 --> 30:15.754
Heracleo and his ships
will carry half our forces

30:15.821 --> 30:16.955
in waves to Sicilia.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.223
Sanus and a clutch
of trusted men to ensure

30:18.290 --> 30:20.191
the Cilicians stay true to bargain.

30:20.259 --> 30:21.726
Am I to remain in the city?

30:21.794 --> 30:24.128
With those known to be loyal to you.

30:24.196 --> 30:27.332
At least that is
what Crassus will believe.

30:27.399 --> 30:29.534
The Roman bodies we have salted
will be clothed to our cause,

30:29.601 --> 30:33.004
and placed to give
the illusion of presence.

30:33.072 --> 30:35.105
You shall lead your forces
through northern gate

30:35.173 --> 30:36.607
and across Melia Ridge,

30:36.675 --> 30:38.676
while we set upon Crassus'
grain holdings on the island.

30:38.743 --> 30:39.877
He will have no choice but to break men

30:39.945 --> 30:41.679
in order to protect his supplies.

30:41.746 --> 30:43.614
Dividing his legions...

30:43.682 --> 30:45.316
Giving you time to crest the ridge...

30:45.384 --> 30:46.951
and drop upon his remaining forces

30:47.018 --> 30:49.653
while they yet believe you
within city walls.

30:49.721 --> 30:51.956
I will be too few to defeat him.

30:52.023 --> 30:52.990
Alone, perhaps.

30:53.058 --> 30:55.760
Yet I would not have you so.

30:55.827 --> 30:57.194
We shall slip from Sicilia

30:57.262 --> 30:59.597
after Crassus' men have
landed to engage us.

30:59.664 --> 31:03.568
And from the sea
we shall join our brothers.

31:06.338 --> 31:10.975
Setting upon Crassus' weakened
forces from two sides.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.011
You knew of this, when we broke words?

31:13.078 --> 31:14.746
I held only Agron to confidence.

31:14.813 --> 31:15.780
Gannicus being brought to knowledge

31:15.848 --> 31:18.950
during return from sea.

31:19.018 --> 31:21.019
I could not risk Laeta and the others

31:21.086 --> 31:22.954
discovering true intention.

31:23.022 --> 31:23.988
You fucking shits!

31:24.056 --> 31:26.391
You have been disagreeable of late.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.493
Any wonder you and your woman
were left from fold?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.628
<i>We must move past it.</i>

31:30.696 --> 31:32.430
Or fall to ruin.

31:36.236 --> 31:37.336
Diotimus told of the bridge

31:37.403 --> 31:40.138
being impassable this late in season.

31:40.206 --> 31:42.707
A thing the Romans will believe as well.

31:42.775 --> 31:45.811
You shall prove them in gravest error.

31:45.878 --> 31:48.013
A lesson I long to teach.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.017
See our people quietly upon land.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.152
And make swift return for more.

31:54.220 --> 31:56.354
I shall try not to kill to many Romans

31:56.422 --> 31:58.056
short of your presence.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.725

33:44.298 --> 33:46.399

with the Cilicians.

that yet serve beneath him.
