WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:13.346
After this, the current policy
of containment may...

00:14.139 --> 00:15.807
no longer be viable.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.977
I need response plans from each of you.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.771
-So, that we can consider--
-What's there to consider?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.440
Are you seeing this?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.818
We need to turn that city
into a parking lot.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.571
Put in your plan, General.

00:30.822 --> 00:34.409
Now, let's take the next 48 hours
to consider options,

00:34.492 --> 00:36.244
and then reconvene for a final vote.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.628
Oh, my God.

00:46.254 --> 00:50.008
Yeah. And it would've been a lot worse
if Major hadn't been there.

00:52.677 --> 00:56.473
-Um... Liv, there's something else.
-More than this?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.934
You know how we've been looking for
Beanpole Bob?

01:01.728 --> 01:04.105
-We found him.
-Well, that's good, isn't it?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.069
[Martin] Liv...

01:09.819 --> 01:12.280
So, does the name Beanpole Bob
mean anything to you?

01:12.363 --> 01:14.866
Drug chemist for Mr. Boss,
the Da Vinci of Utopium,

01:14.949 --> 01:17.077
and according to Ravi, he's you.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.415
Yes, that was me.
I was experimenting.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.461
Then one thing lead to another,
and behold, Utopium.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.838
You invented Utopium?

01:29.255 --> 01:32.050
Did you make the batch that ended up
at the Max Rager boat party?

01:32.133 --> 01:34.135
I'm sorry.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.678
I should've told you.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.807
Should've told me that you're responsible
for turning me into a zombie?

01:39.307 --> 01:42.435
That you are responsible for
the very existence of zombies? You think?

01:45.271 --> 01:47.690
Just please tell me
you still have the formula.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.652
What? Why do you want that?

01:50.735 --> 01:51.903
Ravi developed a cure,

01:51.986 --> 01:54.155
but the Utopium from that batch
is a key component.

01:54.239 --> 01:59.410
Liv... I was high 24/7 back then.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.163
It's all a blur. I wish I could.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.957
-Great. Got it.
-[phone vibrating]

02:05.917 --> 02:06.960
And now, I've got a body.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.921
Thanks for nothing, Bob.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.760
[theme music playing]

02:21.933 --> 02:24.894
I can't believe I trusted a junkie.
What was I thinking?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.814
It's not your fault. Believing in people
isn't a character flaw.

02:27.897 --> 02:31.192
-Duplicity, on the other hand...
-Seriously, guys, you're killing me.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.028
-Just doing our job, Don E.
-You have no idea how hard it is

02:34.112 --> 02:36.656
to run a successful small business
in a zombie economy.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.158
I just rebranded.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.119
Now that there's cops crawling
all over the place, no one's buying.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.454
Do you have to make everything
so murder scene-y?

02:43.538 --> 02:45.373
It is a murder scene.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.378
Oh...

02:50.795 --> 02:52.881
So, this is where the magic happens.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.258
Ravi's first time in a brothel,
message received.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.220
Room belongs to Bunny La Fonda.
Real name unknown.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.098
According to Candy,
the victim asked for her specifically,

03:02.181 --> 03:03.808
but no one has seen her in over an hour.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.894
We put out an APB, no hits so far.

03:06.060 --> 03:10.064
Body was found by a waitress, human,
named Jane Harland.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.317
They took her to the kitchen
to get her things,

03:12.400 --> 03:13.735
then they'll bring her in for questioning.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.986
Who's the victim?

03:15.069 --> 03:17.989
[sighs] Frank Chisel.
Private Investigator.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.033
And a colossal pain in the ass.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.868
So noir.

03:21.951 --> 03:26.080
Clive, you'll be the perpetually
annoyed cop, who's a thorn in Liv's side.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.082
Not much of a stretch, really.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.044
And I'll be the faithful assistant,
loyal to a fault,

03:31.419 --> 03:33.463
but forever destined
to be taken for granted.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.715
Also not much of a stretch.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.800
Careful what you wish for.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.802
[moody blues music playing]

03:56.027 --> 03:57.195
[thunder rumbling]

04:00.156 --> 04:01.574
Have a seat, Miss Harland.

04:03.284 --> 04:06.621
This is our medical examiner, Liv Moore.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.706
It's so dark in here.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.417
Yeah, sorry, bulb blew.
Power went off from the storm.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.462
Rain's coming down harder
than spent slugs.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.880
Yep.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.423
[thunder rumbling]

04:17.882 --> 04:21.177
You told Officer Jenkins that
you were bringing a drink order

04:21.261 --> 04:23.680
to Bunny La Fonda's room
when you found the body, correct?

04:23.888 --> 04:24.973
[sniffles]

04:25.640 --> 04:28.643
-Who ordered the hooch? Bunny or the John?
-Bunny did.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.603
So, the bandage on your finger,
what happened?

04:30.687 --> 04:34.357
When I saw the body,
I dropped a glass and cut myself.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.944
But I swear I didn't have
anything to do with it.

04:38.027 --> 04:38.861
[Clive] That's all right.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.448
We just need a blood sample to test
against the blood found on the scene.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.868
What about Bunny La Fonda,
do you know her real name?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.036
Friends or family?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.122
I haven't worked there that long.

04:50.623 --> 04:54.836
Do you think Bunny did that to him?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.138
Wipe your tears, kid.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.057
In this town, there'll be plenty more
where they came from.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.645
[thunder rumbling]

05:16.065 --> 05:20.236
Still nothing on Bunny La Fonda's
real name or current whereabouts.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.905
Sounds like she's going for
the clean sneak.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.118
So would I, if I'd just buried an ice pick
in a man's skull.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.997
There's a million stories
in this zombie city,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.374
dollars to donuts, this one ends with us

05:33.458 --> 05:35.168
-sending Bunny to the big house.
-[telephone ringing]

05:37.962 --> 05:41.049
Babineaux. We'll be right there.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.552
Bunny's dead.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.095
[inhales deeply]

05:46.512 --> 05:48.347
Make that a million and one.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.024
Ice pick.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.027
Same as Chisel.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.946
[Clive] The freezer thermometer
logs fluctuations in temperature.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.699
The kitchen closed at 9:00 last night,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.452
but the freezer door was opened
for a few minutes around 11:00.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.163
Well, that's long enough
to drag a body inside.

06:12.497 --> 06:16.084
That means Bunny was likely killed
about an hour before Chisel died.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.295
And an hour before Jane said
Bunny ordered those drinks.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.422
Jane Harland lied to us.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.593
Poured us a tall glass of crocodile tears
and we dipped our bills.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.262
I sent a couple of unis to her address,
but--

06:28.346 --> 06:29.514
She's in the wind.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.848
And Bunny ain't talking.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.975
Corpses are funny that way.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.854
Uh, there's a lot
we can deduce from a body.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.523
That's literally our job.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.859
My job is piecing together
who popped this pro skirt and why.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.363
-Yeah, mine, too.
-Mmm. I also aim to help solve murders.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.823
What are you up to, Jane?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.659
What is your connection
to Bunny and Chisel?

06:49.742 --> 06:52.120
And what kind of flimflam
were you mixed up in

06:52.203 --> 06:54.288
that you had to put them
both to sleep last night.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.792
Tag her and bag her, Doc.

07:01.337 --> 07:05.091
You know, I was kidding about the whole
"taken for granted assistant" thing.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.759
[door opens]

07:06.843 --> 07:08.344
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.973
-Did you know her that well?
-Not really, but you know.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.810
Why the long face, Don E?

07:17.145 --> 07:19.730
-Bunny got killed.
-Oh. Bunny...

07:20.773 --> 07:23.234
-She was so skilled!
-Right?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.654
This is such a hassle right now.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.616
-A hassle?
-It's not a huge hassle,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.286
we'll just replace her,
but we're rebranding.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.163
Launching karaoke night...

07:35.246 --> 07:39.125
-Dude, that's the rainy day fund.
-Have you been out there, Don E?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.002
It is a rainy day.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.629
Damn... Bunny.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.674
-Do we know who done it?
-Cops are asking a lot of questions

07:46.757 --> 07:49.802
-about Jane Harland.
-The waitress, she's their suspect?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.554
-Mmm-hmm.
-Huh!

07:52.972 --> 07:55.475
Didn't see that coming.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.852
[Liv] You never do.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.231
You get lost in that innocent face

08:02.315 --> 08:05.860
and those big shinning eyes pleading
for you to be her white knight,

08:05.943 --> 08:07.778
and lift her out of her nightmare.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.200
And before you know it,
she slipped an ice pick in your spine.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.952
Casual as putting a pen back in the holder
at the bank.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.500
Wait, where are you going? Darce?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.293
[door opens, closes]

08:22.418 --> 08:23.794
What's her problem?

08:23.878 --> 08:26.881
That dame's got you dizzy, Don E.
It's what dames do.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.758
But I'll tell you something.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.219
They can't break your heart...

08:35.598 --> 08:37.558
if you never let them near it
in the first place.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.359
It's 8:00 in the morning.

08:47.193 --> 08:51.239
[Ravi] Bunny La Fonda,
mid 20s, 5'4", 110 pounds.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.992
Time of death about 11:00 p.m.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.419
There was a hard rain that night,
the kind that turns streets into rivers.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.880
Rained so hard...

09:08.756 --> 09:12.134
the house cats almost felt bad
for the rats in the alley.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.387
Oh...

09:14.470 --> 09:15.721
Almost.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.723
Is this a bad time?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.643
Uh, Liv's not here at the moment.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.603
That's probably for the best.

09:23.104 --> 09:27.483
I assume she mentioned
my history with Utopium?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.026
It came up.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.112
She told me about your cure.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.366
I'm sorry, I can't remember
what went into the batch

09:35.449 --> 09:37.451
that ended up at that boat party.

09:37.868 --> 09:42.331
But between what you know,
and whatever I can remember,

09:43.040 --> 09:46.252
maybe we can try
and piece it back together.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.297
I wanted to write a symphony.

09:49.755 --> 09:55.428
A crescendo of MDA, mephedrone,
psilocybin, 2C-B...

09:55.511 --> 09:56.554
2C-B?

09:56.637 --> 09:57.513
It's easy to miss

09:57.597 --> 09:59.098
-if you're not looking for it.
-[sighs]

09:59.181 --> 10:02.393
So, how did you develop a cure
without knowing exactly how

10:02.977 --> 10:04.812
the initial chemical reaction
was catalyzed?

10:05.062 --> 10:08.441
I was injecting my test rats with
concentrated Max Rager.

10:08.524 --> 10:12.653
-Their prefrontal cortex's lit up.
-Really? Max Rager?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.824
They took that off the market though,
didn't they?

10:16.907 --> 10:20.953
They did. Fillmore-Graves bought the
company, they still have a stock pile.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.247
You know, I know a guy who works there.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.416
-Lucky for you.
-Indeed.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.211
So, if 2C-B was part
of the chemical composition...

10:29.295 --> 10:30.421
[voice fading]

10:30.504 --> 10:32.965
All I'm saying is,
your father was pretty helpful,

10:33.049 --> 10:34.967
I learnt a lot about reworking the cure.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.053
Could be he's working an angle.

10:37.553 --> 10:41.432
I suppose, but you worked hard to
build a relationship with Martin.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.727
Are you sure you're ready to give up?

10:45.394 --> 10:49.023
-Just think about it.
-Or you could not think about it,

10:49.732 --> 10:56.197
and take a vacation to a little place
called Margaritaville. Who's in?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.618
Oh, come on! I packed up my office today.

11:00.910 --> 11:05.748
My entire career, all that work,
all that effort, fit into one file box.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.668
Look, I need to blow off some steam
like we used to in college after finals.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.421
Sorry, sister.
I got a double murderer to track down.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.759
Fine. More margs for me.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.221
How hard can it be?

11:21.055 --> 11:25.101
They're dying kids, that has to be one of
the top five easiest types of kidnapping.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.937
Not when they know their Freylich brains
are zombie cures.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.482
-Some of them are taking precautions.
-So, up your game.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.901
Get more guns, more guys.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.529
Get one of those net traps Ewoks used.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.572
[Candy] We're all closed up,
anything else...

11:41.283 --> 11:42.618
Ma'am.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.912
-Who's your friend?
-None of your business.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.373
Speaking of business,

11:47.456 --> 11:50.418
go get what you need, get back over
the wall and nab me some more kids.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.753
I've got work to finish. All of you, out.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.134
-[Bubba] After you.
-Hi, I'm Candy.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
[door creaks]

12:10.020 --> 12:14.316
Why, Jane Harland.
What brings you by, this hour?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.153
That's my business.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.198
Which makes it none of yours.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.749
-Cute gun.
-You think I won't use it?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.418
I'm pretty sure you will.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.462
You killed two people already,
what's one more?

12:35.546 --> 12:37.673
What I can't help but wonder though, is...

12:38.257 --> 12:41.135
-Why return to the scene of your crimes?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.471
Well, yeah, that's why I asked.

12:44.221 --> 12:48.184
Just tell me why you killed her.
The PI? Whatever.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.561
But why'd you have to do Bunny like that?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.397
Let's say I saw an opportunity.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.858
Sure, been there.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.903
[bottle breaking]

13:00.279 --> 13:02.490
Hmm. That's better.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.328
Now, let's try this again,
what are you doing here?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.665
What'd you do that for?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.503
It's always the pretty ones.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.382
Ah. Well, I guess I'm glad you came back.

13:22.426 --> 13:26.222
Who are you, Jane, and what are you up to?

13:27.973 --> 13:30.434
We have anything around here
to crack open a skull?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.360
Still no word from the joint chiefs?

13:39.443 --> 13:40.486
No, last time I checked,

13:40.569 --> 13:43.322
they were "formulating a response,"
"they'll notify us," et cetera.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.490
Great.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.912
Please tell me this has nothing to do with
zombie rampages or--

13:49.995 --> 13:51.163
Just boring stuff.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.957
Yeah. Okay. Bring it on.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.335
A few of our security scanners haven't
been logging keycard IDs properly.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.670
Possible we might need an upgrade.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.506
With any luck, we'll get the bugs
worked out of the keycard system

14:00.589 --> 14:02.758
right before they bomb us
back to the Stone Age.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.724
What are you doing back here?
It's nine o'clock.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.811
-Go home, get some sleep.
-I'll sleep when I'm dead.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.229
You're already dead.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.274
We're all already dead, Clive.
We just don't know it yet.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.733
Cool.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.528
Well, I've got
Jane's apartment staked out.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.531
Been talking to anyone
who might know where she's hiding.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.241
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.826
Except search Chisel's office.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.911
Might tell us why
he was looking for Bunny

14:30.995 --> 14:32.621
or what Jane had to do
with either of them.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.331
That's why I filed for a warrant.

14:34.415 --> 14:38.085
Always by the book, Babineaux.
You clear many cases that way?

14:38.168 --> 14:40.379
Almost all of them, as you know.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.131
In my book, almost doesn't cut it.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.632
We're not talking about your book.

14:44.133 --> 14:48.178
We'll pick it back up tomorrow,
by the book, my book.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.057
-Understand?
-Who understands this crazy world?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.560
Good. I'll see you in the morning.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.903
He's right.

15:04.486 --> 15:08.032
The smart thing to do is go home
and wait for the warrant.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.040
But no one ever accused me
of being all that smart.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.407
-Looking for this?
-The classic lamp-reveal.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.410
You set this up just for me?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.455
The only way I'd do anything for you
is in your dreams, blondie.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.291
Does that mean you're not going to share
whatever you found in that book?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.836
All that's in here is Chisel's
client list, what's that to you?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.714
Color me curious what sort of trouble
Bunny had gotten herself into.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.968
-She was a valued employee.
-She was a hooker.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.971
Who brought such joy to so many,
what's more valuable than that?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.056
I'm guessing, to you,
just about anything else.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.767
Freeze, get your hands up!

16:18.811 --> 16:21.814
-Miss Moore?
-Keep your bracelets on your belts, kids.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.607
This is a dead man's office,

16:23.691 --> 16:25.943
I'm sure he wouldn't mind us
having a look around.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.862
To be continued.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.200
I'm counting on it.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.499
You should probably go, too.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.179
Sorry, I thought everyone had gone
home for the night.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.390
Almost. Don't mind me.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.936
-You new here?
-New-ish.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.021
Huh.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.356
-Crawford.
-Major. Nice to meet you.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.151
-Well, I'm off. Don't work too hard.
-[laughs]

17:10.696 --> 17:13.657
-Why do you have two keycards?
-What?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.452
One on your cart and one on your belt.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.704
I only get one and I run the place.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.207
-Something wrong?
-No... [stutters]

17:23.250 --> 17:24.877
You didn't sell that so well, Crawford.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.172
-You better come with me.
-What?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.841
-Why?
-Because I asked you a simple question,

17:30.924 --> 17:32.551
and you broke out in a cold sweat.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.014
I'd just like you to come with me
and answer a few questions.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.474
[breathes heavily]

17:59.244 --> 18:03.582
You broke into Chisel's office?
After I explicitly told you not to?

18:03.832 --> 18:05.959
No one would've been wise
if Blaine hadn't shown up.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.629
What was he up to?
That's the real question.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.255
Did you get an answer?

18:10.339 --> 18:14.426
-The same usual smarmy evasiveness.
-So, that's "no answer."

18:15.385 --> 18:18.305
You're doing a lot of hand-wringing
over diddly-squat, Lieutenant.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.848
My hands have a right to be wrung.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.684
You committed multiple felonies
while I was asleep.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.770
Son of a bitch. His hands.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.940
Blaine was doing the same thing Jane was.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.817
Yeah, I remember.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.195
-You sure it was exactly the same thing?
-Sure as eggs is eggs.

18:34.321 --> 18:38.117
That's what was different.
Blaine's eaten Jane Harland's brain.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.868
Tough to do without killing her.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.455
Okay.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.750
Let's bring him in.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.673
[Clive] You can't smoke in here.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.884
What are you going to do?
Arrest me for smoking?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.094
Yes.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.679
We go by the book around here.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.515
Of course you do.
So, what's the charge this time?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.183
The murder of Jane Harland.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.978
-Jane was murdered?
-Cut the act, you grifter.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.313
-You're not fooling anyone.
-That'd be a first.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.774
Why would I murder some waitress?

19:11.441 --> 19:13.110
-I barely knew the girl.
-What about Bunny?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.778
-You knew her.
-Suppose I did?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.488
Suppose you tell us why
Jane would want to kill her?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.866
Suppose I've been wondering
that same thing myself?

19:18.949 --> 19:20.617
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.120
Suppose you spill your guts,
before I spill 'em for you.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.372
Suppose you both give it a rest.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.126
Where did you even find
Jane's body, anyway?

19:30.544 --> 19:32.504
-We didn't.
-I see.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.049
Is that going to make it tough
to pin her murder on me?

19:36.216 --> 19:37.676
I'll think you'll find me up to the task.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.599
I get it, my father hired you to find me.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.976
A cure? Are you serious?

19:46.894 --> 19:49.438
No, I'm working. Bring it here.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.860
You had a vision.
Shake it up and pour it out, DeBeers.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.029
I did have a vision.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.116
Of a world where a guy like me
can get a fair shake.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.534
I'll give you a fair shake.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.078
-Liv!
-That was just a love tap.

20:05.621 --> 20:09.166
You want the real thing, you two-bit heel?
Tell us what you really saw.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.752
Nothing but the stars, now.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.630
Maybe a lawsuit to go with them.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.050
Anything else for tonight?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.135
You're free to go.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.138
It's almost too easy sometimes.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.398
He had it coming.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.609
Sure, he might have
a prison sentence coming, too,

20:36.109 --> 20:39.655
but you had to go slap-happy.
You might've just blown our shot.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.867
Go home, eat a brain tube, you don't need
to be on Chisel's brain anymore.

20:44.952 --> 20:49.581
And until you get him out of your system,
you're off the case.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.797
I'll get Chisel out of my system...

20:58.382 --> 21:01.301
as soon as I get some answers.

21:02.052 --> 21:06.848
Crawford, Davis, civilian, hired by Enzo
right before he put him away.

21:07.849 --> 21:08.934
What'd we get on the keycards?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.227
One clean, the other stolen.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.272
Reprogrammed to register a blank ID
at any point of entry.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.399
-Do we know where he used it?
-Storage warehouse.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.234
Twelve entries, all in the last two days.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.321
-What'd he want from there?
-Max Rager. Had a case hidden in his cart.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.075
Enzo hires this guy,
gives him a doctored keycard,

21:25.158 --> 21:28.161
six weeks later,
he starts stealing Max Rager.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.415
Maybe Enzo's recruiting outside
of Fillmore-Graves, re-organizing--

21:31.498 --> 21:33.583
Enzo's a lackey, not a strategist.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.502
And Justin's dead.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.214
Someone else must be pulling the strings.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.263
[growls]

21:56.523 --> 21:57.733
Punch a hole in that wall.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.240
[grunts]

22:06.783 --> 22:08.160
[speaking French]

22:12.205 --> 22:16.918
Here's to the zombie cortex-stimulating
properties of Max Rager.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.547
All the pieces of our plan
are finally in place.

22:21.006 --> 22:25.135
Our zombie foot soldiers
can now obey our commands.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.182
The US delegates we scratched
are awaiting instruction.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.185
Are your people prepping for exit?

22:33.268 --> 22:35.729
The team's in place,
and coyote routes are good to go.

22:36.146 --> 22:41.651
Good. Soon, we set
the new world order in motion.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.572
<i>And zombies just love hot sauce, don't we?</i>

22:45.655 --> 22:47.574
<i>So, of course, we'd have some</i>
<i>you could borrow.</i>

22:47.657 --> 22:50.452
<i>Sorry. I guess</i>
<i>that was kind of insensitive. So...</i>

22:50.535 --> 22:51.661
Hey, Grandma.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.539
-Hey, kiddo. You finish all your homework?
-Yeah.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.917
What is all that?

22:57.375 --> 23:00.587
The usual. Fate of the world, et cetera.

23:01.379 --> 23:02.380
What are you watching?

23:02.464 --> 23:06.134
<i>Hi, Zombie! </i>It's this show
about a zombie family in Seattle

23:06.218 --> 23:07.636
who moves in next door to humans.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.429
There is such a thing?

23:10.514 --> 23:11.765
Scoot over.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.683
[indistinct chatter over device]

23:15.435 --> 23:16.561
Hmm.

23:17.562 --> 23:21.691
So, what? They're putting hot sauce
on birthday cake?

23:22.526 --> 23:24.236
They put hot sauce on everything.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.446
Sounds like your grandfather.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.827
[Don E] Darcy, come on.
This is like the tenth message I've left.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.080
Just tell me what I did wrong,
so I can apologize or whatever, would you?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.834
Barkeep! Whiskey sour. Hold the sour.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.129
We're one zombie hooker short, Candy.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.798
Shouldn't you be in the back...
on your back?

23:45.215 --> 23:46.216
[sarcastic chuckle]

23:47.717 --> 23:48.885
Darcy called on the bar line.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.638
-What'd she say?
-To stop calling her.

23:56.726 --> 23:59.646
So, does the name Martel
mean anything to you?

24:01.064 --> 24:02.149
No.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.109
I saw it on the invoice
at Chisel's office,

24:04.192 --> 24:06.361
and I'm just now realizing
why it sounded familiar.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.947
Jacob Martel.
Bought one of our black market cures?

24:09.030 --> 24:10.866
-Yeah.
-I think Chisel was trying

24:10.949 --> 24:13.243
to deliver it to Bunny, and I think
Jane Harland killed her for it.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.162
A cure? So, where is it?

24:15.662 --> 24:17.080
Right where Jane came looking for it.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.084
Here. Right under our noses.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.795
[exclaims softly]

24:24.296 --> 24:26.923
Alyssa Martel. Bunny La Fonda's real name.

24:27.424 --> 24:30.635
Missing since 2016. Father, Jacob Martel.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.221
Did I ever tell you
that I always wanted...

24:33.305 --> 24:35.599
to be a paleontologist when I grew up?

24:35.932 --> 24:37.934
I bet that's a hard job to get fired from.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.645
You don't find any dinosaur bones,
you're just like... "Nope.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.856
No... dinosaurs died here."

24:42.939 --> 24:46.234
Jacob Martel's been paying Chisel
some serious scratch for months.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.529
Boom! Case closed.
All right, let's go dancing.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.907
Bunny's father hired Chisel
to find his daughter.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.700
Chisel tracked her to Don E Be Goodz.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.745
But how does Jane fit in?
What's her motive?

25:03.376 --> 25:06.504
BFF code says you can't let me drink alone
two nights in a row.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.673
Grab your coat. Let's go.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.552
[Chisel] Go to your room.
I'll meet you there.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.065
[gasps]

25:26.441 --> 25:28.944
That's it. Bunny's dad bought her a cure.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.780
But Jane catches the scent,
she bumps off Bunny,

25:31.863 --> 25:34.157
takes her place,
kills Chisel when he shows up,

25:34.407 --> 25:36.117
and makes off with the cure.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.203
So... now is the case closed?

25:38.286 --> 25:41.373
Jane knows that the fuzz'll pat her down
when she's brought in.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.251
So, she stashes the cure at the bar.
She goes back for it.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.211
Blaine's there. He puts her on the spot.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.922
Jane clams up. Blaine croaks her,
eats her brain.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.007
That does sound very Blaine.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.052
But what if he hasn't found it yet?

25:54.135 --> 25:56.221
We aren't going dancing, are we?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.557
We're going to Don E Be Goodz.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.769
Goodz enough!

26:08.316 --> 26:10.443
Dude, we already looked everywhere.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.363
I get why you think Jane stashed a cure,
but it's not here.

26:13.571 --> 26:15.073
It has to be.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.577
Where did you stash the cure, Jane?

26:20.161 --> 26:23.581
You only had a couple of minutes
before the flatfoot brigade showed up.

26:25.375 --> 26:29.421
Okay. What song says everything sucks,

26:29.504 --> 26:31.756
but I'm over it,
but I'm still kind of pissed?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.551
Bunny's room. No, too much heat.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.553
The bathrooms.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.346
Too much traffic.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.181
Tequila. Neat.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.851
-Salt and lime?
-What am I, 16?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.020
The kitchen.

26:47.605 --> 26:48.440
To the kitchen.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.192
I'll make less of a rumpus alone.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.571
[man singing indistinctly]

27:11.254 --> 27:12.297
[crowd applauding]

27:15.508 --> 27:17.552
Keep it going for Mel! Mel!

27:17.719 --> 27:20.680
All right. Up next is Peyton.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.931
Peyton.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.268
Oh, wow! It's that Peyton.
Please welcome to the karaoke stage,

27:25.352 --> 27:27.354
your former acting mayor.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.105
Shut up, song wench.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.984
Okay. This one's for you... Seattle.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.028
But mostly for me.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.212
You're a clever girl, Jane.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.673
You know that cure's worth enough
on the open market to kill for it.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.469
So, where do you squirrel it away?

28:08.978 --> 28:10.355
You again.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.689
Surprised?

28:11.773 --> 28:14.526
To find you lurking
in the shadows? Hardly.

28:14.943 --> 28:19.280
What can I say? I saw you head this way,
and my curiosity was piqued.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.367
Here's hoping that curiosity
has the same effect on you

28:22.450 --> 28:23.868
as on the proverbial cat.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.871
-Why so hateful, Moore?
-How long you got?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.623
For you? All night.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.668
-Keep it in your pants, kitten.
-You've got me all wrong.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.170
All wrong is exactly what you are.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.340
Well, if the shoe fits...

28:40.969 --> 28:42.679
[breathing heavily]

28:44.931 --> 28:46.725
I was hoping you'd do that.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.070
Whatever. I'm done.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.534
Peyton Charles, everyone.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.620
You suck as mayor and as a singer!

29:07.704 --> 29:08.913
[men chattering, booing]

29:12.375 --> 29:13.334
[groans]

29:14.127 --> 29:15.920
-What?
-[glass shatters]

29:16.004 --> 29:19.007
Seriously? On karaoke night?

29:31.936 --> 29:33.438
You throw like a girl.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.315
You're damn right I do.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.108
[groans]

29:57.796 --> 30:00.924
How many lives you think I'd save
if I ended yours right now?

30:01.174 --> 30:02.175
You're no killer.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.718
I'm warming to the idea.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.428
[both grunt]

30:11.601 --> 30:12.644
[panting]

30:13.102 --> 30:16.022
Try me, palooka.
I'll give you something to cry about.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.484
There's two of us... and only one of you.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.861
[Clive] Check your math, big man.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.238
[door opens]

30:32.163 --> 30:34.165
-I got your message.
-Thanks.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.502
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

30:38.962 --> 30:42.215
And I'll bet you a Buffalo nickel
to a Canadian dime,

30:42.757 --> 30:44.259
that's Jane's blood.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.012
Lucky we already have a sample of hers
to test it against.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.057
You're going down, blondie.
Once and for all.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.812
Crybaby killed her. I saw the whole thing.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.064
I'll make a full statement
as soon as I talk to my lawyer.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.650
-Wait, what?
-Sorry, Crybaby.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.528
Can't go around killing people
and expect to get away with it.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.453
What about this one, sir?
Witnesses say she started the bar fight.

31:12.996 --> 31:13.997
Just cut her loose.

31:17.542 --> 31:22.505
All those in favor of launching
Operation Seattle Salvation?

31:27.343 --> 31:28.553
And opposed?

31:31.931 --> 31:34.767
Five for, five against.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.395
You're the tie-breaker, Chairwoman.

31:39.939 --> 31:43.651
Zombies, until recently,
were the stuff of fiction.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.530
Now, they are a reality.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.909
But not the monsters
that we once imagined.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.162
Not monsters? You've seen the footage.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.707
They have the capacity
to become monsters, yes.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.669
But does that make them any different
from any of us?

32:01.753 --> 32:04.339
Because any one of us
could have been a zombie.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.675
Even you, Glenn.

32:08.092 --> 32:12.180
And the only way I'd know is if I saw you
putting hot sauce in your coffee.

32:12.805 --> 32:16.351
I cannot in good conscience
support the killing of innocent people

32:16.434 --> 32:18.937
for fear of what they might become.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.314
So, the nays have it,

32:21.397 --> 32:24.067
and I will advise the President
of our decision.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.487
Thank you all.

32:36.412 --> 32:39.415
All I'm saying is, next time you
and Peyton get into a bar fight,

32:39.499 --> 32:41.918
-I'd like to be there.
-We did all right without you.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.963
Oh, I know. I don't need to participate.
I just want to watch.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.050
Are we absolutely sure Blaine
didn't already find the syringe?

32:49.133 --> 32:51.678
No. We searched him, searched the bar.
Came up empty on both.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.305
[Liv] He wouldn't have followed me
into the kitchen if he already had it.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.226
A trench coat for every day of the week.
Got to admire his commitment.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.437
I saw him put the cure into his coat.

33:01.854 --> 33:04.232
But if it wasn't in the one he was wearing
when we found the body,

33:04.315 --> 33:05.441
and it wasn't at the bar...

33:09.237 --> 33:11.864
"Bonewhistle's Dry Cleaners."
Where have I seen that before?

33:14.993 --> 33:17.078
In the mirror. At the crime scene.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.288
In the frame, with the pictures,
there was a dry cleaner's ticket.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.333
Chisel couldn't risk bringing something
as valuable as the cure into the bar.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.794
So, he put the cure in his coat,
dropped his coat at the cleaners.

33:24.877 --> 33:27.463
Then brought Bunny the ticket,
so she could pick up the cure herself.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.966
We got to get to that ticket
before Blaine figures it out.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.232
What's the occasion?

33:47.483 --> 33:48.985
Darcy agreed to hear me out,

33:50.236 --> 33:52.530
and I have no idea what I'm gonna say.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.367
How do I fix this?
I don't even know what I did wrong.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.327
It's not rocket science.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.874
Knowing you, I'm sure she had
a legitimate reason to be pissed.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.294
Start by admitting that.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.629
You should be able to figure out the rest.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.174
Huh. That actually makes sense.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.509
Then my work here is done.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.935
Good luck, Don E.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.489
Great. What now?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.491
[Don E mocking]

34:47.085 --> 34:48.961
[Blaine] Hoping to find
the dry cleaning slip?

34:49.128 --> 34:50.671
Looks like someone beat us to it.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.215
Looks like someone beat you.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.426
Nice work. How did it feel?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.386
Like Christmas in July.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.224
Call the cleaners, get them
to hold Chisel's coat until we get there.

35:01.307 --> 35:02.308
Hands on the wall.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.481
[telephone ringing]

35:37.677 --> 35:39.470
-You all set?
-You bet.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.139
Where are we headed?

35:41.597 --> 35:43.975
Corvallis, Oregon.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.768
Perfect.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.460
Hey.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.629
I'm really sorry.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.840
Okay. For what?

36:16.632 --> 36:18.551
Okay, I... I don't know.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.388
But I'm sorry for whatever it was.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.311
Okay, I'm sorry, too.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.648
It's just, when Bunny died,

36:32.732 --> 36:34.609
all you cared about
was finding a replacement.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.528
And it made me wonder
if you'd act the same way when...

36:38.196 --> 36:39.322
you know...

36:39.614 --> 36:41.657
No. No.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.578
It's not... that I didn't care.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.624
It's... it's just a lot of people
in my life have died.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.878
But, Darce, I'll never be able
to replace you.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.632
Because I love you.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.592
Really?

37:05.264 --> 37:06.265
[gasps]

37:06.807 --> 37:08.893
Darcy... Uh...

37:10.353 --> 37:11.187
Bennet?

37:11.938 --> 37:12.897
Darcy Bennet...

37:16.234 --> 37:17.360
will you marry me?

37:19.820 --> 37:21.239
Screw it. Yeah, why not?

37:28.079 --> 37:31.499
Candy? The trivia genie
slash cosmetologist slash zombie madame?

37:32.208 --> 37:34.168
Clive said the woman
who picked up Chisel's coat

37:34.252 --> 37:35.503
matched her description.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.546
Checked her apartment. She's gone.

37:37.630 --> 37:41.425
-Looks like a clean getaway.
-Another day, another cure lost.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.722
-How's the hangover, babe?
-Hmm.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.558
It's a fitting end to my career as mayor.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.646
I don't remember doing anything.
All I'm left with is the pain.

37:54.146 --> 37:57.775
Oh, I feel like a shower hook is stabbing
into my brain.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.612
-Oh. Too soon?
-Yeah.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.406
Too soon for what?

38:03.489 --> 38:06.742
Some guy at Fillmore-Graves
impaled himself on a shower hook.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.660
-What?
-Yeah.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.912
We caught him using a doctored keycard
to steal Max Rager.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.872
So, he killed himself.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.208
[Liv] Oh, my God. Seems a bit extreme.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.626
Tell me about it.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.753
[Ravi clears throat]

38:27.638 --> 38:28.639
What's up?

38:28.723 --> 38:32.351
In the lab, I told your father
about Max Rager's effects

38:32.435 --> 38:35.313
on the zombie rats.
He had a lot of questions.

38:35.396 --> 38:38.274
So what? You think
that he got some wingnut

38:38.357 --> 38:40.651
to infiltrate Fillmore-Graves
and steal Max Rager?

38:41.027 --> 38:42.987
Maybe he was working an angle after all.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.364
I know you've gotten close,
but given his track record--

38:45.448 --> 38:48.117
There is one door at his house
that's heavily bolted.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.829
Maybe there is something behind it
he doesn't want anyone to see.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.125
He's got an NA meeting tonight.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.420
[thunder rumbling]

39:55.643 --> 39:56.894
Liv.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.729
That's Utopium, all right.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.023
January 31st, 2013.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.242
Fall 2014.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.204
October 3rd.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.791
October 6th, October 14th...
One of these has to be the tainted batch.

40:18.916 --> 40:19.959
[door opens]

40:21.210 --> 40:22.294
[footsteps]

40:25.798 --> 40:26.674
Grab them. Let's go.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.720
[thunder rumbling]

40:41.021 --> 40:42.106
[Liv gasps]

41:04.128 --> 41:05.171
[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

41:05.337 --> 41:08.299
This is US Army General Glenn Mills.

41:08.507 --> 41:11.010
I believe we have an agenda in common.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.930
And I think we can be of use
to each other in achieving it.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.394
I'm listening.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.571
[theme music playing]
