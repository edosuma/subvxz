WEBVTT

02:18.764 --> 02:21.506
All right, line 'em up. Single file.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.466
Everybody out.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.957
- Hey!
- Get back in line.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.706
Did you hear me?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.258
This chick needs a doctor.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.169
Look, I won't say it again.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.256
Relax.

03:05.018 --> 03:09.854
She'll be all right.
You two, take care of this prisoner.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.441
Come on, now. Move. Follow me.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.381
Over to the desk.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.804
These numbers are your new names.
Make sure you don't lose them.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.135
Go in that room.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.653
Hey. I think I had this one the last time.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.784
Shut up!

04:15.380 --> 04:19.999
Karen Brent, there's no room
for revolution in here. Remember that.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.337
(Warden) OK, strip 'em and get 'em wet.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.687
Ain't you been in the can before, honey?
It don't warm up.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.921
Bobbie?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.616
(Shrieks)

05:33.542 --> 05:34.577
Ohh.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.534
(Giggling)

05:39.756 --> 05:40.370
Ohh.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.003
Ooh.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.060
Ohh!

05:55.146 --> 05:56.728
Mm.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.897
Ohh.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.063
Hey! Cut it out.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.154
Ohh!

06:07.576 --> 06:08.941
Ohh! Ohh!

06:12.372 --> 06:14.238
Ohh. Ooh.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.874
Ooh.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.137
(Means)

06:34.394 --> 06:36.010
Oh!

06:40.775 --> 06:45.690
That's enough. Now dry off, go across
the hall, and get dressed. Hurry up.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.863
Fuck!

06:48.950 --> 06:52.659
It's the closest we're going
to get to a man for a long time.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.517
Enjoy it?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.642
Jealous?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.320
Keep it up, and you'll go blind.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.401
Piss off!

07:39.334 --> 07:42.201
(chirping)

07:46.675 --> 07:49.133
Ooh! You work fast, don't you?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.927
I like to make things comfortable.

07:52.013 --> 07:56.803
If you know the right people in here,
you can get anything you want.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.136
How many times
you been in the can, Ronda?

08:00.230 --> 08:03.814
This makes four.
I've got a bad eye for cops.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.517
They look like any other trick to me.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.649
Hey, what'd they bust you for?

08:09.739 --> 08:12.197
I like expensive things.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.991
And you got caught stealing them.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.240
Let's drop the true confessions.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.366
These people you know here.
Can they get guns?

08:22.460 --> 08:26.579
To get a gun, you need something to trade
that's pretty damn valuable.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.381
What you got, besides your ass?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.672
- Is there a way out?
- You mean breaking out?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.804
Not one that's worked.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.179
You in here for something heavy?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.636
A parking ticket!

08:42.731 --> 08:45.348
Just a question.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.525
What about your guerrilla friends
on the outside?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.773
Can't <i>they</i> do something for you?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.361
(Dog barking)

08:52.449 --> 08:53.814
(Foreign language)

09:15.680 --> 09:18.263
Daniels! Up!

09:18.349 --> 09:21.011
- What d'y0u want?
- Come with me.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.855
- What's this about?
- Come on!

09:39.954 --> 09:42.867
Densmore must be feeling horny tonight.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.745
She was drooling over Daniels
this morning.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.328
Seemed to dig you, too.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.464
What's her scene?

09:52.550 --> 09:54.791
She's got this thing going with Logan.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.629
That's the other matron.
But she likes a lot of side action.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.593
If she digs you, things in here
can be a hell of a lot easier.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.105
(Ronda) Too bad.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.901
She got tired of me.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.402
We started off badly this morning, Daniels.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.579
That's unfortunate.

10:24.666 --> 10:29.331
Having an inmate dislike me
makes my job that much tougher.

10:31.881 --> 10:36.091
But discipline is something
that must be maintained.

10:37.846 --> 10:43.262
And the more... intelligent prisoners,

10:44.352 --> 10:46.593
well, they realise that,

10:46.688 --> 10:49.225
and they cooperate with me.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.477
In every way.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.856
(Daniels) Oh, I'm all
for cooperation.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.813
Good. I'm glad.

10:59.784 --> 11:04.824
And now that we're buddies,
how about letting me get back to sleep?

11:05.540 --> 11:08.248
What's your hurry?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.877
I mean, it's...
it's much more comfortable here.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.046
Here, have a drink.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.426
Have a drink.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.179
It'll help you to relax.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.773
What's the matter? Don't you indulge?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.898
When I feel like it.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.904
All right.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.902
I won't force you, Daniels.

11:43.995 --> 11:48.330
We'll just see how long it takes you
before you come to me.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.626
- And not very long, I'll bet.
- Just as long as you don't force me.

11:57.425 --> 12:01.214
Your attitude is gonna make it
very tough for you in here.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.967
(Densmore) You can get your ass
kicked in.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.511
Or maybe that's it.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.063
Maybe that's what you want.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.402
I should have known
by your attitude this morning.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.494
Well, it's gonna be a pleasure.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.795
- How's that?
- Asshole!

12:36.881 --> 12:39.714
- You leave her alone.
- Get the hell outta here!

12:39.801 --> 12:44.216
- Get clown. You've had too much to drink.
- Will you leave me alone?!

12:44.305 --> 12:47.093
I've told you before,
leave the prisoners alone!

12:47.183 --> 12:50.016
My wrist!
You're breaking my goddamn wrist!

12:55.817 --> 12:58.229
(Logan) Get her outta here.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.239
Densmore?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.497
- Yeah.
- All she wanted was a piece of ass.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.454
- Next time we'll send you.
- All right.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.583
I'll kill that bitch.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.850
Why don't you just leave me alone?

13:36.357 --> 13:39.224
Here, this'll make it feel better.

14:40.171 --> 14:43.254
(Densmore) Brent!
You can rest if you like.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.244
(Engine starts)

15:28.511 --> 15:32.049
(indistinct chatter)

15:36.018 --> 15:39.977
(Silverware rattling)

15:47.572 --> 15:50.690
Hey, Brent. Did you have a good morning?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.990
Beats working in a field.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.570
The rest of us had to make up for you.
That's not too cool.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.242
Hey, bitch! I'm talkin' to you.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.749
Look, you had your chance,
you didn't want it.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.332
So get off my ass.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.677
Excuse me, Ronda.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.513
Hey! Easy! I just washed my hair.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.526
(General uproar)

16:42.793 --> 16:44.909
(Logan) All right!

16:46.005 --> 16:48.121
OK.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.584
You've been asking for it.
A day in the oven.

16:52.094 --> 16:57.305
A terrorist and a hooker.
You two should have lots to talk about.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.766
(Daniels) Ow! These walls are on fire!

17:06.858 --> 17:09.442
Shit! Keep your ass down!

17:09.529 --> 17:11.111
Oh!

17:12.365 --> 17:14.481
This ridiculous box.

17:16.661 --> 17:21.781
I really don't believe you, Daniels,
giving me shit about going with Densmore.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.333
I just don't like
holding up somebody else's end.

17:25.419 --> 17:30.164
Everybody shares everything.
You're the revolutionary.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.875
You should be able to dig on that.

17:32.969 --> 17:37.213
I'm looking for a way out of this camp,
and I'll do anything I have to.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.674
That's cool.
Just don't put any extra weight on me.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.180
I need out just as much as you do.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.638
- Maybe more. Oh!
- Oh!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.972
(Karen) Stop pushing!

18:15.553 --> 18:17.965
OK, come on. You're being transferred.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.969
- Where to?
- The city. Maximum security.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.138
Some questions need answers.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.683
Come on.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.864
- What makes Brent so important?
- She has contacts for guns and money.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.664
And she's close to the top.

18:46.751 --> 18:50.494
- And her friends will try and get her back?
- We'll be ready.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.137
- What's this for?
- We have to take special care of you.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.011
- I'm sure you understand.
- Uh-uh.

19:04.101 --> 19:09.187
- Hook me up with somebody else.
- Why? I thought you two liked each other.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.514
Come on, let's go.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.351
You sure make a darling couple.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.686
Get in.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.866
Go sit down.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.678
You're asking for it.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.157
(Densmore) I hope our police escort
is on time.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.466
They're expecting somebody.
Your friends, maybe?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.426
- Maybe.
- Ooh.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.603
How bad are you? You got
somethin' to say with them?

20:32.690 --> 20:37.730
What about you? I thought you were
in for smack, sale and possession.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.859
I was steam clean.
They planted me because they know me.

20:41.949 --> 20:46.614
They know my old man, too.
He's the biggest dealer on this island.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.662
I guess they wanna find out
about the people we know.

20:49.749 --> 20:54.038
Yeah. I can't handle the way
those national cops ask questions.

21:18.486 --> 21:21.945
- (Man 1) What the hell is this?
- (Man 2) Get them off the road.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.074
(Gunfire)

21:33.000 --> 21:35.162
Easy on the bus! Karen's in there!

21:46.597 --> 21:50.591
We're supposed to have help waiting.
Where in the hell are they?

21:53.646 --> 21:56.434
Dammit!
Where's the help you promised me?

22:13.457 --> 22:15.198
Argh!

22:18.337 --> 22:20.248
Get Karen!

22:34.562 --> 22:36.178
Come on.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.188
(Sirens wailing)

22:39.275 --> 22:41.312
Look, there's Karen!

23:07.094 --> 23:09.961
- What about Karen?
- She'll have to handle it.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.257
Fall back! Fall back!

24:05.486 --> 24:08.979
(Panting)

24:09.657 --> 24:13.070
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm not going any further.

24:13.160 --> 24:19.247
- Don't start that again. It's been settled.
- I have till tomorrow. Time's running out.

24:19.333 --> 24:24.169
Dig? We happen to be where we are,
which is good for me, tough shit for you.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.336
I can't help that.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.585
We're turning around.

24:29.677 --> 24:32.590
Listen, bitch.
You can stick that up your ass.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.591
Now let's go!

24:34.682 --> 24:38.141
If I don't get there,
my people don't get the guns they need.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.390
Then everything we've been after
is a bust.

24:41.480 --> 24:46.099
We're trying to set this island free.
You're black! You understand, don't you?

24:46.193 --> 24:49.402
I understand about me,
just like you did back at that prison.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.321
- This is different.
- My ass!

24:52.408 --> 24:55.400
I've spent the last two years
living with a prick I hate,

24:55.494 --> 24:59.488
so I could beat him out of enough cash
to get me what I've been after all my life.

24:59.581 --> 25:03.074
There's a boat waiting to get
me and my money out of here for good,

25:03.168 --> 25:06.752
and some jive-ass revolution
don't mean shit to me.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.581
- I've had money all my life.
- My heart bleeds for you.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.337
It didn't get me anything, ever.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.471
Is this two-bit hick island
important to you?

25:16.557 --> 25:20.801
If it is, maybe your
good life back home got old,

25:20.894 --> 25:23.761
and this is the little rich chick's new toy.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.473
How about it, little sister?

25:58.307 --> 25:59.638
Ow!

26:09.401 --> 26:10.812
(Karen) Bitch!

26:24.374 --> 26:25.990
Shit!

26:51.068 --> 26:53.435
- Sefior Galindo.
- Cruz.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.067
A disappointing performance.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.364
Three of the terrorists are dead.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.489
- The rest were lucky to...
- Three dead men are nothing.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.446
The minister wanted to question
the two women you let escape.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.165
My responsibility
was for the police escort.

27:08.252 --> 27:12.371
Your responsibility is what I tell you it is.
We want those women.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.626
We've already set roadblocks.
They'll be caught.

27:18.178 --> 27:21.762
For your sake, I hope so.

27:21.849 --> 27:25.888
Take that as a personal message
from the minister.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.766
(Bells toll)

27:38.031 --> 27:41.114
Hey, Lee. I've got an idea. Quiet.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.031
(Nuns scream)

28:19.656 --> 28:23.024
Hello, Sisters. Could I offer you a ride?

28:42.179 --> 28:45.046
- Where are you headed, Sisters?
- Uh, to town.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.930
Oh, that's too far to walk.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.479
- Lucky I came along.
- Mm. We prayed that you would.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.651
(Man) The black one.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.608
Your friend, Juana.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.160
She has escaped from prison.

29:09.539 --> 29:13.908
Tell me where Lee is going,
and there is no more pain.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.959
- (Buzz)
- (Woman cries out)

29:17.047 --> 29:19.084
- (Buzz)
- (Screams)

29:27.683 --> 29:29.048
(Buzz)

29:32.479 --> 29:35.141
No one betrays me, Juana.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.059
No one runs away. Ever.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.983
You know that.

29:43.824 --> 29:47.567
I cannot afford
to let her be captured again.

29:47.661 --> 29:50.574
She knows too much.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.123
What the two of you have going,
I know about that.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.918
And I know she told you her plans.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.003
- (Buzz)
- (Screams)

30:08.307 --> 30:09.797
- (Buzz)
- (Screams)

30:09.933 --> 30:13.972
Out of all the girls that work for me,

30:14.062 --> 30:17.771
you're one of the ones
I bring to this house.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.020
You're lucky.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.772
Your drugs are the best,

30:22.863 --> 30:28.074
and you don't have to sweat your ass off
screwing drunks in one of the houses.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.662
Tell me where she is,
and nothing will change.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.747
Oh, please, Vic.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.043
I don't know.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.081
You don't talk... you don't need this.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.665
No!

30:44.760 --> 30:47.001
- No!
- Tell me, Juana.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.262
Oh, God, Vic! Please!

30:52.184 --> 30:55.142
I swear I don't know!

30:55.228 --> 30:57.890
I'd tell you, I swear it!

31:05.072 --> 31:07.530
She's telling the truth.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.857
Oh, God.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.887
Vic...

31:36.978 --> 31:40.892
Vic, I'd never lie to you.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.347
Never.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.729
I'd do anything you say. I always have.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.485
You believe me, don't you?

31:52.536 --> 31:55.073
Of course I believe you.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.953
Only I had to be sure.
You understand, don't you?

32:01.628 --> 32:04.495
You are still my baby.

32:09.177 --> 32:12.295
- I want to talk to Rocco.
- Everybody get out.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.475
The black bitch. Find her.

32:21.565 --> 32:24.557
OK. And when I do, she's dead.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.940
You bring her to me.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.948
She has got $40,000 of my money.

32:33.034 --> 32:36.698
- I want it back.
- Is it the money, Vic?

32:38.039 --> 32:41.657
I sell more junk
than anybody on the islands,

32:41.751 --> 32:44.834
and I have more whores
humping in my houses.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.710
Should one bitch matter to me?

32:50.093 --> 32:51.959
I was just asking.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.306
Find her. Just find her.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.013
(Driver singing)

33:09.529 --> 33:12.146
Look out!

33:18.497 --> 33:22.411
- What's that?
- It's a charm bracelet.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.885
(Groans)

33:44.189 --> 33:46.851
Son of a bitch.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.617
The one that killed Paris,
I got him right in the neck.

34:02.707 --> 34:06.291
- It was beautiful!
- Yeah. I bet we killed six of them.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.540
- Maybe more.
- Yeah.

34:08.630 --> 34:12.168
- Only we lost three of our own.
- And we didn't get Karen.

34:13.260 --> 34:18.551
Let's not jack off. Our asses got kicked
today, because we have no firepower.

34:20.641 --> 34:24.260
And we'll keep getting beat
until we get the money and the guns.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.938
If we don't find Karen by tomorrow night,
we're not going to get them.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.686
Her contacts
would never turn them over to us.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.188
She got away. That's good.

34:34.614 --> 34:39.949
She's chained to another prisoner,
and that's bad. We'll see what happens.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.404
- Why can't we look for her?
- Cops are all over the countryside.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.580
No, we'll wait.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.204
Maybe she'll be able to come here.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.754
If not... she's smart enough
to be in San Carlos.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.128
I've got Amato watching Cruz
and the other pigs.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.086
When they know something, we'll hear.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.187
Easy, huh?

35:36.259 --> 35:38.170
Nasty little boy.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.449
(Daniels) There'd better be two seats together.

36:25.225 --> 36:28.763
Sister, what if this thing hits a roadblock?

36:30.313 --> 36:33.146
I don't know. Do you feel like hiking?

36:34.234 --> 36:35.816
No.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.486
We're going the wrong way.
We've gotta get off.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.194
It's the right way for me, baby.

37:28.288 --> 37:31.906
You screw up this deal for me, I'll kill you.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.453
That's some heavy talk
for a woman of the cloth.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.084
What would our friends over there say?

37:43.219 --> 37:47.759
I'm as sick of dragging your ass
as you are pulling mine.

37:47.974 --> 37:51.467
But I ain't given' up this ride
till we get somewhere we can snap loose.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.973
So quitjivin' me.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.576
You get this one.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.508
(Gunfire)

39:18.147 --> 39:22.562
Station one to Cruz, station one to Cruz.
Come in, please. Over.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.571
All right, Daniels, it's time
to straighten out a couple of things.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.154
My people broke me out
cos they need me.

39:35.248 --> 39:39.082
I've got to meet them
in San Carlos by tomorrow night.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.160
Until we can separate,
you're 00min' along.

39:42.255 --> 39:47.546
Who put you in charge? San Carlos
is all the way across this fucking island!

39:47.635 --> 39:51.299
I've got friends in Los Robles.
That's a hell of a lot closer.

39:51.389 --> 39:55.508
They'll snap us loose and get me off this
island. Then I don't care where you go.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.809
You'd be in a cell right now
if it wasn't for me.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.979
Yeah, yeah.
But what have you done for me lately?

40:04.152 --> 40:09.238
All right. So we're stuck with each other.
We've gotta get outta here.

40:10.325 --> 40:14.034
Let's keep it together
until we can find a way out of these.

40:15.288 --> 40:17.325
Right on.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.479
(Country music on jukebox)

40:46.611 --> 40:50.024
Yep. I swear it, Captain.
You got a problem.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.983
See, I don't like cops, and cops
don't like me, so why should I help you?

40:55.078 --> 40:58.070
Can you explain that?

40:58.164 --> 41:01.748
For the same reason
you do everything else, Ruben.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.575
Money.

41:04.671 --> 41:07.254
10,000 reward.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.299
He's a smart man, Alfredo.

41:13.096 --> 41:16.589
- What kind of women are worth that much?
- These two are.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.558
Dead or alive.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.313
- You want a drink, Captain?
- No, thank you.

41:33.032 --> 41:37.367
Why don't you keep the reward
and get the prisoners yourself?

41:37.453 --> 41:39.911
- (Yells)
- Cut that shit!

41:44.752 --> 41:49.371
We could do that, but it would take
more time than we want to spend.

41:51.009 --> 41:56.175
Bullshit! This guy is a cop. No cop
would give you the sweat off his balls.

41:56.264 --> 41:58.551
Now, we got big problems,
mostly farmers.

41:58.641 --> 42:02.430
That means no payoffs for the pigs,
so the pigs stay out. How am I doin'?

42:02.520 --> 42:06.514
He don't know the territory
or the people, so he needs us.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.063
Very sharp thinking, Ruben.

42:18.745 --> 42:21.203
Now, what about it?

42:28.379 --> 42:29.835
Listen.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.334
(Fiddle solo on jukebox)

42:32.425 --> 42:34.666
Ain't that beautiful?

42:36.721 --> 42:39.179
Will you find them?

42:40.099 --> 42:45.640
A reputation for helping cops is shit
for my image, so keep out of my province.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.764
Deal.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.192
Cruz.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.493
You want a woman?

43:07.335 --> 43:09.952
Lupe, go say hello to the captain.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.969
(Birdsong)

43:39.283 --> 43:40.648
(Woman) Oh!

43:41.410 --> 43:43.242
(Moaning)

44:08.813 --> 44:11.475
I sure hope he can hold it!

44:16.779 --> 44:18.816
(Man yawning)

44:33.254 --> 44:34.836
Antonio.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.961
If she comes, have her wait.
I'll be talking to you.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.849
The roadblock.
She's going in the wrong direction.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.677
All I know is she got away again.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.229
And she needs help.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.864
A reward for Ruben Rojas?
He should be hanged.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.443
You want the women. He can find them.

45:06.579 --> 45:09.537
We have a police force
to capture criminals,

45:09.665 --> 45:12.157
not to contract other criminals for the job.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.959
I've got men watching Ruben.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.839
- Dare I tell that to the minister?
- I don't know.

45:19.926 --> 45:22.338
- It's a disgrace.
- That's true.

45:26.182 --> 45:28.674
Is that all you have to say?

45:30.269 --> 45:33.512
Your attitude
will be included in my report.

45:34.315 --> 45:35.976
Galindo.

45:37.068 --> 45:40.777
I almost forgot.
I met a friend of Ruben's today.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.981
- I'm not the least interested.
- Her name is Lupe.

45:44.909 --> 45:47.776
She tells me
she's a good friend of yours, too.

45:53.793 --> 45:56.285
How about the minister?

45:56.379 --> 45:58.916
Does he know her too?

45:59.006 --> 46:01.964
When you give him the report, ask him.

46:02.051 --> 46:04.133
Or if I see him, I will.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.461
Yes, yes... Yes.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.092
Keep up the fine work, Captain.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.691
Let's get out of the captain's way.
Come along.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.520
Your desk is filthy!

46:23.614 --> 46:25.651
(Whistles nonchalantly)

46:43.259 --> 46:48.004
(Lounge music playing)

46:48.264 --> 46:51.222
Cruz has Ruben Rojas looking for them.

46:51.309 --> 46:54.017
Ten big ones for a reward.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.845
Where are they going?

46:56.939 --> 47:00.477
Is she following the other one,
or is she following Lee?

47:02.069 --> 47:04.106
I don't know.

47:05.197 --> 47:08.030
Stay close to it.

47:08.117 --> 47:11.826
It's his territory. He warned us to stay out.

47:12.580 --> 47:18.701
That greasy cowboy. He doesn't
have the balls to pressure us.

47:36.395 --> 47:39.012
He doesn't have the balls.

47:48.157 --> 47:50.239
I don't see anybody. Do you?

47:50.326 --> 47:52.192
No. Uh-uh.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.493
Shall we?

48:05.091 --> 48:07.799
That's gonna take too long.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.210
- Can you work that thing?
- I need a flame.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.592
Get me one of those sticks.

48:13.682 --> 48:15.093
Hi.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.227
We thought no one was home.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.555
I was asleep.

48:23.901 --> 48:26.768
Too much to drink, you know.

48:28.364 --> 48:31.231
We were kidnapped.
Bandits from the hills.

48:31.325 --> 48:34.192
They took us from school.

48:36.288 --> 48:39.371
Oh, that's too bad.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.916
I like schoolgirls.

48:44.338 --> 48:45.920
Drink?

48:55.850 --> 48:57.887
Good, huh?

48:58.602 --> 49:00.843
Will you get us out of these chains?

49:00.938 --> 49:02.724
(sniggers)

49:04.400 --> 49:06.437
Little students.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.686
I'm not as stupid as I look.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.815
I know who you are,

49:12.908 --> 49:15.650
and I'll get a piece of the reward.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.987
And I'll make Ruben very happy.

49:19.957 --> 49:24.747
Look, you don't wanna turn us in.
We've got friends that can help you.

49:31.677 --> 49:34.089
You could be our friend.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.842
Don't you wanna be our friend?

49:37.725 --> 49:40.342
Are you going to be nice to Luis?

49:42.396 --> 49:44.728
Both of you?

49:44.815 --> 49:47.523
Nicer than you'll ever know.

49:57.453 --> 50:00.616
Luis don't have to make deals.

50:00.706 --> 50:03.118
Luis takes what he wants...

50:03.209 --> 50:05.450
when he wants!

50:07.087 --> 50:08.452
Help!

50:22.853 --> 50:25.561
Lee, help me! Get something!

50:35.658 --> 50:37.865
Is he dead?

50:38.744 --> 50:41.486
Get that fucking thing lit.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.666
(D09 barks)

50:50.756 --> 50:52.963
- Shit!
- Come on, come on! Cut us loose!

50:53.050 --> 50:55.917
No, there's no time.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.386
Get those rags.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.596
Get that rag there.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.316
Hurry!

51:36.719 --> 51:39.177
(Country music on radio)

51:50.983 --> 51:53.691
Hey, boss, I think you're offbeat.

52:08.083 --> 52:11.201
(D0gs bark)

52:14.465 --> 52:18.208
- The body is Luis.
- You sure it ain't one of the girls?

52:18.302 --> 52:21.294
Not unless they hung like horse.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.471
Ah, well. That'd be Luis.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.765
What do we do now, boss?

52:26.852 --> 52:30.846
We gonna sleep. We'll get 'em
in the morning. They ain't far.

52:30.939 --> 52:33.806
- We sleep in the house, boss?
- Alfredo!

52:34.652 --> 52:38.236
Why don't you sleep out here
and take care of the boys?

52:43.827 --> 52:45.818
(Jungle noises)

53:19.905 --> 53:22.772
(Ruben) Somebody killed our man
Carlos here and stole the dogs.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.233
He's supposed to be watching the dogs.

53:32.918 --> 53:36.661
Looks like old Carlos
had one mother fucker of a night.

53:36.755 --> 53:40.419
- The dogs are gone.
- The women took them, boss?

53:42.553 --> 53:45.045
I don't know. Maybe.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.970
- Somebody did.
- How are we gonna find 'em now?

53:50.060 --> 53:53.598
Well, asshole, why don't you get down
on all fours and we'll follow you!

53:53.689 --> 53:55.896
I dunno how we gonna find 'em!
They're headed for the river,

53:55.983 --> 54:00.318
so that's where we're going,
if that's all right with everybody!

54:01.822 --> 54:04.484
Get a shovel and cover that up.

54:36.774 --> 54:41.894
(Country music on radio)

55:08.972 --> 55:12.431
- S0meb0dy's following us.
- No shit.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.555
Haul ass.

55:30.494 --> 55:33.657
You wanted to supervise from the field?

55:33.747 --> 55:37.957
- Here we are.
- They wouldn't harm us, would they?

55:47.261 --> 55:49.673
Been workin' hard, babe?

55:51.306 --> 55:53.343
You've covered a lot of ground today.

55:55.143 --> 55:58.135
The deal was no cops.

55:58.230 --> 56:00.688
It's only me. No others.

56:00.774 --> 56:02.856
The car isn't marked.

56:02.943 --> 56:04.354
Out.

56:09.408 --> 56:12.867
You know Sefior Galindo, of course.
His office pays the reward.

56:12.953 --> 56:16.287
That is absolutely correct, Rojas.
We have definitely...

56:16.373 --> 56:17.955
Cut!

56:35.142 --> 56:37.804
Which one of 'em's
got the biggest pecker?

56:39.354 --> 56:41.391
The captain. Eight.

56:44.151 --> 56:46.233
Him? Four.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.687
Maybe less.

56:48.780 --> 56:51.021
Eight to four...

56:54.369 --> 56:57.327
- Drop 'em.
- This is an outrage. I'll see to it...

56:57.414 --> 56:59.872
Drop 'em.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.549
Eight.

57:25.067 --> 57:27.104
- Four?
- No.

57:27.194 --> 57:29.231
Three and a half.

57:32.616 --> 57:36.234
Old buddy, I'm gonna do you a big favour.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.114
(Preys)

57:39.081 --> 57:41.118
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

57:41.625 --> 57:43.616
(Preys)

57:48.131 --> 57:50.873
I don't wanna see your rotten ass
around here no more.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.209
Sure. Anything you...

57:56.515 --> 58:00.349
I'll see you again,
when I come to pick up my money.

58:29.339 --> 58:32.127
- Come on, get up!
- (Panting) I can't. I can't.

58:32.217 --> 58:34.254
Get up!

58:56.116 --> 58:58.528
(Dogs barking)

58:58.618 --> 59:01.485
(Daniels) Sounds close. Wait a second.

59:04.666 --> 59:09.035
Here, puppy. Hello, doggy.
Here, boy. Here, puppy.

59:09.129 --> 59:12.997
- What are you doing?
- Shut up! Here, puppy. Here, puppy.

59:13.133 --> 59:16.797
Good puppy. Good puppy. Good doggy.

59:18.388 --> 59:21.130
Oh, good dog. Good dog.

59:21.224 --> 59:24.057
Here, hold him. Good dog.

59:24.144 --> 59:25.555
Yes.

59:29.357 --> 59:31.598
Don't let him go.

59:32.444 --> 59:36.608
Here, my little friend.
Wear them in good health. Now go. Go on!

59:37.282 --> 59:41.276
Run, you little bugger!
Run! Go on! Go on!

59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.094
(Panting)

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.098
(Country music on radio)

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:18.897
I heard your music! Who else could it be?

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.573
Sorry, Manuel, old buddy.
You just ain't my type.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:25.490
But your daughters are. Oh, Manuel.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:31.371
You've been keeping
some secrets from me, old buddy.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.930
My, my, my.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.257
How you have grown.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:02.695
No, Ruben! Put me down, Ruben!
Put me down!

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.817
Hey, Manuel.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.495
Get some men to watch the river.
Those women are coming this way.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.869
(Foreign language)

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:14.914
(Barks)

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:22.342
Grab him!

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.901
Go home, you little faker.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:44.027
- Karen.
- How can you tell? Sight, or smell?

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:49.286
By the way her mind works.
They went the other way.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.704
To the river.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.998
Turn around.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.535
Here.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.955
(Man shouts)

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:51.136
(Foreign language)

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.659
Hoy! (Foreign language)

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.855
(Ruben and girls frolicking)

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.900
These figures better be right.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:47.150
Of course they're right.
I always make Ruben happy.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.403
Manuel Bagnio always makes him happy.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.951
Your daughters make him happy all right.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.615
(Roars)

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.952
Go, man!

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.472
- Get off him! Get off him!
- Leave me alone!

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:25.981
- Oh, come on!
- I told you to get off him!

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.228
Let's play it by ear.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.361
Geronimo!

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.368
Ruben! Come see the reports.
The payoffs are good.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.920
- (Ruben growling)
- (Girls laughing)

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.963
Ruben!

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:54.555
Come on, let's talk business.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.303
- (Ruben laughs)
- (Girl) Come on, man!

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.721
(Karen laughs)

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:07.786
Get him, Lee!

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:12.503
- Hit him!
- It's OK. I've got him.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.335
Fuck that! Hit him! Shit!

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.466
- Someone just drove in with the dogs.
- Who are they?

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:57.260
- I don't know.
- Get the men together.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.798
- Boss!
- (Laughter)

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.099
- Boss!
- Boss!

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.769
- What the hell is it?!
- Get dressed, boss. Quick!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.142
- What is it?
- Somebody's got our dogs.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:10.065
Oh, shit!

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:24.163
(Mumbling a song)

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.788
Papa, would you please leave the room?

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.465
We've got to get dressed.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.073
All right, fucker. Them's my dogs.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.165
I guess they are. They look like you.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.444
You gonna give me them dogs back?

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.359
No.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.130
They do look like you!

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.443
I wish I knew what all that shooting was.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.656
You go look.
I'll wait for you on the other side.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:26.173
We've lost a lot of time. Get the dogs.
See if they can pick up the scent.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.365
In a couple of hours we'll be there.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:55.489
My friend Leonardo
will give you a ride to San Carlos.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.787
- I promise.
- You sure?

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:01.868
He owes me his life.
Him and Vic had an argument.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:05.204
Leonardo wanted out.
Vic wanted him shot.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:10.543
I like the guy, so I asked Vic
not to do it, and he let him go.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.711
- He owes ya.
- Mm.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.640
And he's a fisherman. We'll use his boat.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.970
- You wanna come?
- No. I can't.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.767
- We'd better go.
- Uh-uh.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.476
Not until we've had our dessert.

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:00.012
(Vehicles approaching)

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.584
It's Ernesto.

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:27.911
Ernesto!

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:31.338
Ernesto! Here!

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.304
Karen!

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.519
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi, Bonito.

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.605
What are you doing here?
We thought you'd try for San Carlos.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.909
- Too long a story.
- We had no other choice.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:02.454
This is Lee Daniels, a friend of mine.

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:06.374
- Hi.
- We have to take her to Los Robles.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.665
- All right.
- Oh, good.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:12.167
How about bustin' these chains?

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:32.354
You'll have to wear those bracelets
for a while.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.436
Who cares?

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.236
How'd you find us?

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.613
We wanted to return these.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.366
You mean you had the dogs
we were runnin' from?

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.370
We stole them last night
from the place you burnt down.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.828
Come on. We've got
a lot of travelling to do.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.761
Leonardo's boat.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:04.508
So that's why she's headed here.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.552
I should have known.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:10.308
You should have killed him
when you had the chance.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.515
It's not too late.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:16.695
It's gonna take some work this time.
I think he's got help.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.983
Yes. Nothing comes easy.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:40.843
- Like shooting fish in a barrel.
- If they fall for it.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.140
Why shouldn't they?
Just keep the men out of sight.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:35.325
- We could do a lot with that money.
- I plan to.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:39.458
Hey, why don't you go home to your
silver spoon, and really get behind it?

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.755
Take Romeo with you.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.420
Uh-uh. That's not revolutionary.

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:50.597
Look, I've been a revolutionary
ever since I was 13,

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.846
the first time I was paid to do it.

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.645
Now, baby, I've just won the war.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.348
- That's all there is?
- Yeah.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:10.235
Where is everybody?

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:15.865
Maybe we should
pick up our marbles and go home.

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.331
It's a little late for that.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:36.098
- What's the matter?
- It smells like an ambush.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.850
- Maybe I'm wrong.
- What are we gonna do?

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.184
- Which one is your boat?
- The near one, on the right.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:48.235
Get ready to board.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.213
Ready?

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.516
Nice to have met you.

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:31.732
(Gunfire)

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.711
(Gunfire in distance)

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.610
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.783
- Sure?
- I said yes. Now get your ass on that boat.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.538
Lee! Come on, come on!

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.210
Shit! I left my spare clip in the truck.

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.503
It's all right!

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.562
- She's getting away.
- The hell she is.

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:38.405
Cast off! Let's go!

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.664
Karen!

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.153
Karen?

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.341
Look out!

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.800
(Brakes squealing)

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.565
(Sirens wailing)

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:26.115
- Have you called Galindo yet?
- Yes, sir. He's on his way.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.202
Twelve years a captain.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.454
I'll be a major before dinner.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.411
Congratulations, sir. It's long overdue.

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.713
It's better to win, isn't it?

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:52.144
(Waves lapping)
