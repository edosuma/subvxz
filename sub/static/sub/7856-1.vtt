00:57.389 --> 00:58.989
Argh!

01:33.989 --> 01:35.389
Evening, sir.

01:46.429 --> 01:47.989
The new librarian, miss.

01:53.629 --> 01:55.669
Henry Cavendish. How do you do?

01:55.709 --> 01:59.269
I'm Virginia Lewthwaite,
Lord Hellion's fiancee.

01:59.309 --> 02:00.749
He's been called away to London

02:00.789 --> 02:03.789
so I'm afraid I must suffice
in his absence.

02:03.829 --> 02:07.469
I shall try not to keep you
from your occupations.

02:07.509 --> 02:09.068
On the contrary,

02:09.109 --> 02:10.829
I'd welcome the company.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.749
We're very isolated here,
Mr Cavendish.

02:13.789 --> 02:15.989
I fear you'll be bored.

02:16.029 --> 02:17.949
I welcome the seclusion.

02:17.989 --> 02:20.469
It gives me time to write.

02:20.509 --> 02:21.469
You're an author?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.269
I only claim to be budding.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.869
I think...

02:24.909 --> 02:27.349
there will be plenty here
to inspire me.

02:30.029 --> 02:31.509
Is the wedding imminent?

02:32.509 --> 02:34.949
The 6th of June.

02:34.989 --> 02:39.309
A very small affair, as my fiance
lost his first two wives.

02:44.229 --> 02:45.389
Line.

02:45.429 --> 02:47.069
'In tragic circumstances.'

02:47.109 --> 02:48.349
'Cut!'

02:48.389 --> 02:51.829
If Miss Fontaine would deign
to learn her lines

02:51.869 --> 02:53.349
before coming on set,

02:53.389 --> 02:55.789
it would save us all a lot of time,

02:55.829 --> 02:58.189
which, as you know, means money.

02:58.229 --> 03:01.669
Something that is in
painfully short supply.

03:01.709 --> 03:04.709
And do try and inject
some ingenuousness.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.749
You're meant to be a virgin bride.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.669
I've seen more innocence
on a ten bob tart.

03:11.709 --> 03:13.549
You would know, darling.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.309
Miss Swain,

03:17.349 --> 03:19.949
may I borrow you
for a moment, please?

03:23.549 --> 03:26.149
Could you demonstrate
to Miss Fontaine

03:26.189 --> 03:29.709
what innocence sounds like?

03:29.749 --> 03:31.549
I'm Virginia Lewthwaite,

03:31.589 --> 03:32.909
Lord Hellion's fiancee.

03:34.309 --> 03:37.429
He's been called to London,
so I'm afraid I must suffice...

03:37.469 --> 03:40.829
I'd murder the little tart before
taking acting lessons from her.

03:41.909 --> 03:43.749
Miss Fontaine! Reset.

03:43.789 --> 03:45.109
Let's try again.

03:46.589 --> 03:49.189
They were forced to move
out of their last place

03:49.229 --> 03:52.189
because of complaints about noise.

03:52.229 --> 03:53.669
And this film,

03:53.709 --> 03:55.269
The Demon Brides.

03:55.309 --> 03:57.069
In the name of all that's unholy...

03:58.189 --> 04:00.989
And you such a movie buff, Mrs M.

04:01.029 --> 04:02.989
I like a proper one,

04:03.029 --> 04:08.709
like, oh, Casablanca
or The Prisoner of Zenda,

04:08.749 --> 04:11.749
but this rubbish is just an excuse
for blasphemy and...

04:13.029 --> 04:15.029
..and scantily clad women.

04:15.069 --> 04:16.589
Isn't that right, Father?

04:16.629 --> 04:19.668
We rather enjoyed Virgin Vampires
at the Odeon last month.

04:19.709 --> 04:20.909
Isn't that right, Father?

04:20.949 --> 04:24.349
It raised some interesting
theological questions.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.189
Well, I do hope you'll sign
the petition

04:26.229 --> 04:27.989
on behalf of the parish council.

04:28.029 --> 04:30.069
Not so fast, Mrs McCarthy.

04:30.109 --> 04:32.869
One of the actors is a chum,
and I've asked him round

04:32.909 --> 04:35.109
to answer any parochial concerns
you may have.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.589
There he is now.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.829
If she thinks I'm going to let
my opinion be swayed

04:41.869 --> 04:44.429
by some B-list actor...

04:44.469 --> 04:46.469
Hello. I'm Rex Bishop.

04:46.509 --> 04:47.509
Ooh!

04:51.629 --> 04:53.189
Hello. Father Brown.

04:53.229 --> 04:55.029
And this is our Parish Secretary.

04:55.069 --> 04:57.629
Mrs McCarthy is one
of your greatest fans.

05:00.749 --> 05:02.509
And...

05:02.549 --> 05:03.549
cut!

05:04.989 --> 05:07.429
That was wonderful, darling.

05:13.749 --> 05:15.109
Care to explain, Billy?

05:15.149 --> 05:16.549
We're spreading.

05:16.589 --> 05:18.149
Vivian wanted cuts.

05:18.189 --> 05:20.029
I'll have no lines left
at this rate.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.189
He might as well have hired
a cleavage.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.789
This is her.

05:24.829 --> 05:27.309
The old hag would stop at nothing
to sabotage my career.

05:27.349 --> 05:28.989
Get me a martini.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.389
I need some lubrication
for all that screaming.

05:31.429 --> 05:34.589
I hate this place. Ditto.

05:34.629 --> 05:35.909
There's only one thing for it.

05:35.949 --> 05:37.469
We'll have to run away together.

05:37.509 --> 05:39.229
Sweet William.

05:39.269 --> 05:42.349
But then we'd have to live in
a garret and I don't want that.

05:43.629 --> 05:44.989
I want what she's got.

05:48.509 --> 05:50.109
Careful, Billy.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.909
That girl will break your heart.

05:54.349 --> 05:57.389
So I said,
"Madam, I am sorely tempted,

05:57.429 --> 05:58.589
"but your husband

05:58.629 --> 06:01.429
"is the middleweight boxing champion
of the world

06:01.469 --> 06:03.069
"and my face is my fortune."

06:05.149 --> 06:07.669
You're a long way from Hollywood,
Mr Bishop.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.549
Los Angeles is hot and sticky.

06:10.589 --> 06:12.789
And you can't get
a proper cup of tea.

06:12.829 --> 06:15.469
Oh, and another scone, Mr Bishop?

06:15.509 --> 06:17.669
I thought you'd never ask,
and call me Rex.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.509
If I may call you...

06:19.549 --> 06:21.749
Rex! Bridget!

06:21.789 --> 06:27.029
Bridget, the Celtic goddess
of fire and wisdom, and...

06:27.069 --> 06:30.909
creator of the finest strawberry
scone I've ever tasted.

06:30.949 --> 06:34.229
Do tell us what the film
is about, Rex.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.589
Well, it's about a demon lord

06:37.629 --> 06:40.869
who sacrifices his wives to the
devil on their wedding night

06:40.909 --> 06:44.349
and reincarnates them
as demon brides.

06:44.389 --> 06:45.989
Hardly Chekhov, I'm afraid.

06:46.029 --> 06:47.549
Sounds jolly good fun.

06:47.589 --> 06:49.789
Although I'm not sure Mrs McCarthy
would approve.

06:49.829 --> 06:52.829
Oh, no! Why don't you see
for yourselves?

06:52.869 --> 06:55.429
As my guests tomorrow.
The full tour.

06:55.469 --> 06:56.509
Oh!

06:58.949 --> 07:01.309
Pull back. Pull back.

07:01.349 --> 07:05.429
And if Miss Fontaine could try and
look like she's in a drugged stupor.

07:05.469 --> 07:07.629
It shouldn't be too much
of a stretch.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.309
And cue, darling.

07:10.349 --> 07:12.749
Exto malikus.

07:12.789 --> 07:15.189
Exto vascatis.

07:15.229 --> 07:17.829
Exta invero Hellion.

07:17.869 --> 07:21.829
Oh, cut! Cut! Cut!

07:21.869 --> 07:24.629
For the last time,
this is a closed set!

07:24.669 --> 07:27.149
These are the representatives
of the Parish Council.

07:27.189 --> 07:29.389
I don't care if it's the Pope
and his entourage.

07:29.429 --> 07:30.789
What are they doing here?

07:30.829 --> 07:32.229
You invited them.

07:32.269 --> 07:34.189
Told Rex to do his bit for PR,

07:34.229 --> 07:37.149
or, to use your words,
schmooze the local yokels.

07:40.189 --> 07:43.189
I do apologise for my oaf
of a husband.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.869
Bebe Fontaine.

07:45.909 --> 07:47.629
Hello. Hello.

07:47.669 --> 07:48.909
Welcome to hell.

08:00.389 --> 08:05.349
And now the local lunatic fringe
are getting up a petition.

08:05.389 --> 08:09.149
And, to cap it all, I've been
receiving death threats.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.429
Some maniac calling himself Arulus.

08:12.469 --> 08:15.909
Seems to think I'm the devil
reincarnated.

08:15.949 --> 08:18.149
Can't think what gave him that idea.

08:18.189 --> 08:20.349
Interesting choice of objects d'art.

08:20.389 --> 08:24.509
Now, that is the death mask
of the demon lord.

08:24.549 --> 08:26.909
Must be a non-speaking part.

08:26.949 --> 08:28.309
Hasn't got a mouth.

08:28.349 --> 08:30.629
His face has been melted
with holy water.

08:30.669 --> 08:31.909
Will that work, Father?

08:31.949 --> 08:33.589
Don't think so, no.

08:33.629 --> 08:36.429
Billy Neville.
Author of this masterpiece.

08:36.469 --> 08:38.669
Put a priest into the castle.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.109
What for?

08:40.149 --> 08:42.989
Oh, add some colour.
Bells and smells.

08:43.029 --> 08:45.309
He can turn wine into blood,

08:45.349 --> 08:47.269
bread into flesh.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.629
Why would a demon lord

08:48.669 --> 08:51.229
have a Catholic priest
living under his roof?

08:51.269 --> 08:53.469
You're the writer,
think of something,

08:53.509 --> 08:55.309
and I want it by four.

08:55.349 --> 08:57.149
What's she doing here?

08:57.189 --> 09:00.069
She, my darling,
is entertaining our guests,

09:00.109 --> 09:02.229
which is more than can be said
for you.

09:02.269 --> 09:06.069
May I introduce Miss Paulette Swain,

09:06.109 --> 09:09.949
one of our fastest rising stars?

09:09.989 --> 09:11.709
And what part do you play?

09:11.749 --> 09:14.829
A foul demoness in thrall
to a devil.

09:14.869 --> 09:17.429
I'm something of a writer myself.

09:18.509 --> 09:20.949
You must tell me where you get
your inspiration from.

09:20.989 --> 09:22.989
From everything around me.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.749
Ars vitam imitator.

09:25.829 --> 09:27.389
Art imitates life.

09:27.429 --> 09:28.629
This isn't art.

09:32.749 --> 09:34.589
You must leave, Virginia.

09:34.629 --> 09:35.789
Are you mad?

09:35.829 --> 09:37.149
I'm due to be married tomorrow.

09:37.189 --> 09:39.989
Yes, I'm mad. I can't be sane
when I'm with you.

09:43.509 --> 09:46.909
My father is deeply indebted
to Lord Hellion.

09:46.949 --> 09:49.149
If this marriage doesn't
take place tomorrow,

09:49.189 --> 09:50.789
he'll be ruined

09:50.829 --> 09:52.389
and my family dishonoured.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.109
Cut!

09:59.149 --> 10:02.549
Is it too much to ask for you people
to learn your damn lines

10:02.589 --> 10:06.629
before stepping onto my set?
You're costing me a fortune.

10:06.669 --> 10:10.349
Principles to their dressing rooms
now.

10:10.389 --> 10:13.509
I want you word perfect by five.

10:15.189 --> 10:17.029
We're in detention, I'm afraid.

10:17.069 --> 10:19.269
I don't have trouble
remembering my lines.

10:19.309 --> 10:20.749
You don't have any lines.

10:20.789 --> 10:23.709
Feel free to stay
and we'll reconvene later. Yes.

10:25.629 --> 10:27.549
Universal Studios!

10:27.589 --> 10:29.709
They've offered me a movie
starting in the spring.

10:29.749 --> 10:31.589
Escape the garret, Billy.
Clever boy.

10:31.629 --> 10:34.629
Nicholas Ray's directing and Robert
Mitchum's lined up for the lead.

10:34.669 --> 10:37.309
You seem to forget
that you're contracted to me

10:37.349 --> 10:39.549
for your next two movies.

10:39.589 --> 10:43.389
In your own words, any typewriter
monkey could churn out this dross.

10:43.429 --> 10:45.149
I don't want any monkey.

10:45.189 --> 10:47.109
I want the monkey I've got.

10:47.149 --> 10:49.309
So you can just get back to Universal

10:49.349 --> 10:51.429
and tell them
that you're not available.

10:51.469 --> 10:53.549
And I want those amendments by four.

10:55.349 --> 10:58.229
Till then, I'm watching rushes.

10:58.269 --> 11:00.629
Do not disturb...

11:00.669 --> 11:02.749
under pain of death.

11:07.389 --> 11:08.429
Ergh!

11:08.469 --> 11:10.589
Oh! Jesus, Mary and J...

11:10.629 --> 11:14.549
Sid. And now he's got X-ray eyes.
How did you know it was me?

11:14.589 --> 11:16.869
Brylcreem, Gold Flake and engine oil.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.829
And what exactly do you think
you're doing, Sidney Carter?

11:19.869 --> 11:21.949
I'm earning ten bob a day
as an extra, Mrs M.

11:21.989 --> 11:22.869
Ladies.

11:24.029 --> 11:25.629
Tough job,

11:25.669 --> 11:27.989
but someone's got to do it. Ta-ta.

11:28.029 --> 11:30.189
Ooh-ho-ho-ho!

11:39.829 --> 11:41.589
'Foul demoness! You're nothing...

11:41.629 --> 11:44.989
'You're nothing but a foul...
You're nothing but a foul demoness.

11:45.029 --> 11:47.789
'You're nothing...' 'Take one.'

11:49.349 --> 11:52.309
'If divorce were an option,
I'd have done it years ago.

11:53.909 --> 11:55.669
'Yes. Well...'

11:55.709 --> 11:58.909
Yes. No. No, it's not
still a possibility.

11:58.949 --> 12:01.389
He's got a ten-year option
on my contract

12:01.429 --> 12:03.029
and you can bet your boots

12:03.069 --> 12:05.669
I'll never work in this
or any other town again.

12:08.309 --> 12:12.989
No, trust me, darling, the only way
I'll escape my caro marito

12:13.029 --> 12:14.789
is with one of us in a box.

12:53.829 --> 12:55.829
Argh!

13:08.469 --> 13:10.429
Are you going to tell us
what happens?

13:10.469 --> 13:13.669
And spoil the ending for
when we see it at the cinema?

13:13.709 --> 13:16.109
Oh, somebody's changed their tune.

13:16.149 --> 13:17.749
This is a morality tale

13:17.789 --> 13:21.029
where the godly triumph
over the forces of evil.

13:21.069 --> 13:23.949
Nothing blasphemous in that
now is there, Father?

13:26.709 --> 13:28.109
Morning, Father.

13:31.109 --> 13:33.189
Shall we say our goodbyes? Yes.

13:36.629 --> 13:38.549
Vivian, open up.

13:39.749 --> 13:41.909
I got here at four as ordered
and the door was locked.

13:41.949 --> 13:43.749
And apparently he hasn't
left the wing.

13:43.789 --> 13:47.189
Perhaps he's had a heart attack?
I'll break it down. Vivian!

13:53.749 --> 13:56.949
A good secretary
always keeps a spare.

13:56.989 --> 13:58.189
What a woman!

14:05.709 --> 14:07.749
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.389
I'll call the police.

14:15.269 --> 14:17.309
What happened? Is he dead?

14:24.629 --> 14:26.789
Per istam sanctam unctionem
et suam...

14:26.829 --> 14:30.109
If you're praying for his soul
then you're wasting your time.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.109
Sir.

14:48.149 --> 14:50.389
Did no-one tell them
it's the day of rest?

14:57.549 --> 15:00.749
To Vivian. May he rot in hell.

15:00.789 --> 15:02.189
Shut up, Bebe.

15:02.229 --> 15:04.509
Medicinal. For the shock.

15:04.549 --> 15:06.109
Thank you, Billy.

15:06.149 --> 15:08.709
Oh, please.
You'd think you were grieving.

15:08.749 --> 15:11.309
We all know you loathed him
as much as the rest of us.

15:11.349 --> 15:13.149
Try to keep it together, old girl.

15:13.189 --> 15:14.949
So, what happens now?

15:14.989 --> 15:17.429
I suppose the show must go on.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.669
I'd rather be on a yacht
in the south of France.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.669
Wouldn't we all?
But have you forgotten

15:21.709 --> 15:23.469
that you are the new owner
of Cardinal?

15:23.509 --> 15:26.709
Hardly. The first person
she telephoned was Vivian's lawyer.

15:26.749 --> 15:28.749
What am I supposed to do?

15:28.789 --> 15:31.509
Appointing a new
director would be a start.

15:31.549 --> 15:33.829
Fine. Rex is new Director.

15:38.109 --> 15:39.549
There now. Wasn't that easy?

15:43.669 --> 15:47.469
At least the killer was good enough
to leave a signature.

15:47.509 --> 15:49.709
Any idea on this Arulus?

15:49.749 --> 15:52.509
The victim's been receiving
death threats.

15:52.549 --> 15:55.789
"Your fate approaches.
Apocalypse 20:10."

15:55.829 --> 15:58.389
How's your Bible knowledge, Sir?

15:58.429 --> 16:00.709
Hazard a guess. Erm...

16:00.749 --> 16:04.509
Apocalypse 20:10:
"And the false prophet

16:04.549 --> 16:08.829
"shall be tormented by day
and by night for ever and ever."

16:08.869 --> 16:11.229
It's like I said a prayer
and there you were.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.429
Thank you, Padre.

16:14.469 --> 16:18.189
And now my sergeant here will
escort you from my crime scene.

16:18.229 --> 16:21.149
It's just that I was here when
the body was discovered and I think

16:21.189 --> 16:24.829
I may have inadvertently removed
a significant piece of evidence.

16:26.189 --> 16:27.709
A piece of wax.

16:27.749 --> 16:29.509
Wax?

16:29.549 --> 16:33.069
From a gothic horror film set?
What next?

16:33.109 --> 16:34.549
A coal from Newcastle?

16:36.509 --> 16:38.829
But it's an unusual shape,
don't you think?

16:38.869 --> 16:40.869
Leave it with one of my men,

16:40.909 --> 16:43.109
I'll see it gets the attention
it's due.

16:43.149 --> 16:44.429
Sir?

16:44.469 --> 16:47.989
In you come, Constable.
The Padre was just leaving.

16:55.149 --> 16:57.349
Inspector Mallory.
Kembleford Police.

16:58.389 --> 17:00.669
I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs Wolsey.

17:00.709 --> 17:04.348
Well, that makes one of us.
I prefer Miss Fontaine.

17:05.509 --> 17:07.829
Did my husband suffer, Inspector?

17:07.868 --> 17:09.069
I do hope so.

17:15.029 --> 17:17.949
I'd like you all to account
for your movements

17:17.989 --> 17:20.469
between two and four this afternoon.

17:20.509 --> 17:22.749
Shouldn't you be looking for this
Arulus fellow?

17:22.789 --> 17:25.909
I could, but I'd be wasting
my time, as it wasn't him.

17:28.029 --> 17:30.269
Because of the death threats,

17:30.309 --> 17:33.709
Mr Wolsey stationed extra security
guards on the wing

17:33.749 --> 17:37.309
who are adamant that nobody entered
or left the building

17:37.349 --> 17:40.069
between two, when his
secretary went home,

17:40.109 --> 17:42.709
and 4:15, when the body
was discovered.

17:42.749 --> 17:45.469
Are you saying it was one of us?

17:45.509 --> 17:50.149
I'm saying that as the only people
in this part of the building

17:50.189 --> 17:51.589
at the time in question,

17:51.629 --> 17:54.549
I'd like you all to account
for your movements.

17:54.589 --> 17:57.229
I was in my office doing
amendments for Vivian.

17:57.269 --> 17:59.389
I was learning lines in
my dressing room. Me too.

17:59.429 --> 18:02.229
Me three.
On Vivian's orders, I hasten.

18:03.629 --> 18:07.189
During this time, did anyone see
or speak to Mr Wolsey?

18:09.949 --> 18:11.629
Oh, dear.

18:11.669 --> 18:13.509
I think somebody is lying.

18:17.469 --> 18:20.029
When you're ready, Miss Fontaine.

18:22.149 --> 18:26.589
I opened my dressing room door
to put my shoes out for wardrobe

18:26.629 --> 18:29.949
and somebody was
going into my husband's office.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.829
Isn't that right, Miss Swain?

18:33.869 --> 18:34.869
Is this true?

18:36.709 --> 18:38.109
Yes.

18:38.149 --> 18:40.109
And you lied because...?

18:40.149 --> 18:42.109
Because it was confidential.

18:42.149 --> 18:44.789
I was signing a contract
for my part in his next movie.

18:44.829 --> 18:46.229
What part?

18:48.709 --> 18:49.869
My part.

18:52.349 --> 18:54.709
Oh, you little tramp!

18:54.749 --> 18:55.949
What time was this?

18:55.989 --> 18:57.029
Around three.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.069
Vivian thought it required
someone...youthful.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.069
Yet not someone who can act.

19:02.109 --> 19:03.709
And what time did you leave?

19:03.749 --> 19:05.389
You're sacked!

19:05.429 --> 19:08.629
About ten minutes later, when I can
assure you he was alive and kicking.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.789
You can't sack me.
I've got a contract.

19:10.829 --> 19:13.389
In that case, I'll just have
to content myself

19:13.429 --> 19:14.829
with making your life a misery.

19:19.509 --> 19:21.709
I mean, talk about a catfight.

19:21.749 --> 19:24.229
Half the crew heard it.

19:24.269 --> 19:27.029
Anyway, Mallory's convinced
it was an inside job.

19:28.749 --> 19:31.749
Mrs McCarthy's our resident
movie expert -

19:31.789 --> 19:34.029
what do you know
about Bebe Fontaine?

19:34.069 --> 19:38.589
What I know is that she was born
Ursula Donnell

19:38.629 --> 19:41.589
and educated by the
Sacred Heart Sisters in Dublin.

19:41.629 --> 19:44.309
So, a good Catholic Irish girl.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.429
Oh, not so you'd notice now.

19:47.389 --> 19:50.149
She was married at 17
to Vivian Wolsey

19:50.189 --> 19:53.229
and he old enough to be her father.

19:53.269 --> 19:55.869
And they didn't live
happily ever after.

19:55.909 --> 19:58.909
Rumour has it, she wanted a divorce,

19:58.949 --> 20:01.789
but that would have been
the end of her career.

20:01.829 --> 20:04.629
See, she was contracted
to the Cardinal Studios,

20:04.669 --> 20:08.109
so none of the other studios
would have touched her.

20:08.149 --> 20:10.309
Oh, motive aplenty, I'd say.

20:10.349 --> 20:11.789
I doubt it was Paulette Swain.

20:11.829 --> 20:13.549
How do you figure that, milady?

20:13.589 --> 20:15.469
She'd just landed her
first leading role.

20:15.509 --> 20:17.269
She's hardly going to kill
the golden goose.

20:17.309 --> 20:19.669
That young writer looked
pretty murderous

20:19.709 --> 20:22.909
when Vivian refused to release him
from his contract.

20:22.949 --> 20:24.309
What do you think, Father?

20:25.869 --> 20:27.669
I think that the problem
with three actors

20:27.709 --> 20:30.189
and a writer is that they all
lie for a living.

20:31.349 --> 20:33.829
Well, I'm certain it isn't
Rex Bishop.

20:33.869 --> 20:36.509
Mmm, he is hiding something.

20:36.549 --> 20:38.549
Yes.

20:38.589 --> 20:42.029
Like why is he starring
in a Cardinal B-movie in Kembleford?

20:44.669 --> 20:47.869
In sickness and in health,

20:47.909 --> 20:49.949
to love and to cherish...

20:51.349 --> 20:53.069
..till death do us part.

20:57.909 --> 21:00.109
And cut. Thank you, everybody.

21:00.149 --> 21:03.589
Let's go again with a little less
smoke this time.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.589
Miss Fontaine, may I have a word.

21:06.629 --> 21:10.069
I was wondering if you could be
a little more bereft.

21:11.309 --> 21:13.309
Hardly an emotion I'm familiar with.

21:13.349 --> 21:16.749
Just try to bear in mind that you're
being bound in matrimony

21:16.789 --> 21:19.469
to a man you don't love while
the man that you do love

21:19.509 --> 21:21.789
has gone inexplicably AWOL.
Mr Bishop.

21:24.229 --> 21:27.269
Can I prevail on you to accompany me
to the cutting room?

21:37.469 --> 21:39.469
Demon Bride. Scene 25.

21:39.509 --> 21:40.749
Take 3.

21:42.989 --> 21:45.269
Closer on the cleavage.

21:45.309 --> 21:46.629
Closer!

21:48.029 --> 21:49.509
And action!

21:52.189 --> 21:54.109
Henry's aroused.

21:54.149 --> 21:55.949
Can we get some arousal in here?

21:55.989 --> 21:58.869
Which means try
and look like you're enjoying it!

21:58.909 --> 22:01.149
All right, that's enough!
Please stop that now.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.869
I'd like a word in private, please.

22:05.309 --> 22:06.709
If you don't mind, ladies.

22:11.869 --> 22:13.269
You might get a better performance

22:13.309 --> 22:16.229
if you refrained from bawling me out
in front of the cast and crew.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.309
It's putting me
off my stride, old chap.

22:18.349 --> 22:20.789
You're not in Hollywood now,
old chap.

22:20.829 --> 22:25.389
Clearly, but manners costeth
nothing, as my nanny used to say.

22:25.429 --> 22:28.029
Did Nanny tell you that
photographs do?

22:28.069 --> 22:30.269
Which means for the duration
of our arrangement

22:30.309 --> 22:31.709
you will do things my way.

22:33.309 --> 22:34.749
Good boy.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.109
Reset. We'll go again.

22:37.229 --> 22:38.909
Not if I kill you first.

22:45.229 --> 22:47.509
It was a trifle.
An artistic disagreement.

22:48.589 --> 22:50.909
And these photographs?

22:50.949 --> 22:53.629
Publicity shots. They were shocking.

22:53.669 --> 22:54.709
I demanded new ones.

22:56.149 --> 23:00.749
This is an unusual project
for Rex Bishop to attach himself to.

23:00.789 --> 23:02.389
I was homesick for Blighty,

23:02.429 --> 23:06.149
fancied a change of scene amidst
the glories of the Cotswolds.

23:06.189 --> 23:10.069
You've gone on record describing
Cardinal Productions as...

23:11.469 --> 23:14.349
..boils on the backside
of the movie industry.

23:14.389 --> 23:16.989
Have I really?
I say, that's rather good.

23:19.109 --> 23:20.829
This isn't a joke, Mr Bishop.

23:20.869 --> 23:22.149
Clearly not, Inspector,

23:22.189 --> 23:25.549
which is why I would appreciate
you getting to the point.

23:25.589 --> 23:29.229
I think Vivian Wolsey
was blackmailing you.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.589
You've no proof of that. Yet.

23:34.629 --> 23:37.349
But I've applied for a warrant
to search Mr Wolsey's personal files

23:37.389 --> 23:40.509
and when I find something
incriminating,

23:40.549 --> 23:42.429
that gives you the hat-trick -

23:42.469 --> 23:44.629
means, motive and opportunity.

23:44.669 --> 23:47.429
So until then, Mr Bishop,
don't go anywhere.

23:50.229 --> 23:54.749
Lady Felicia.
Looking delectable as ever.

23:54.789 --> 23:57.349
If only I could return
the compliment, Inspector.

24:01.709 --> 24:02.829
What's going on, Rex?

24:05.589 --> 24:07.589
Vivian was blackmailing you?

24:07.629 --> 24:10.429
I don't think anyone believes
I'm here of my own volition.

24:10.469 --> 24:12.029
Because you're homosexual.

24:15.109 --> 24:16.789
How did you know?

24:16.829 --> 24:18.749
Despite certain encouragements,

24:18.789 --> 24:21.589
you've never tried to get me
in to bed.

24:21.629 --> 24:24.149
The only other explanation is
I'm losing my allure...

24:24.189 --> 24:26.029
I think we both know that
isn't the case.

24:27.909 --> 24:32.229
If the police find those photographs
I'll end up in prison.

24:32.269 --> 24:34.589
Nonsense, we'll think of something.

24:34.629 --> 24:35.869
I need a miracle.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.429
I can't promise you that,

24:38.469 --> 24:40.909
but I might have the next
best thing.

24:46.389 --> 24:49.069
Ah, Mrs McCarthy, just the woman.

24:49.109 --> 24:52.389
Dress suiting a saint,
eight letters.

24:52.429 --> 24:55.269
Two letters,
requiring urgent reply -

24:55.309 --> 24:58.429
Bishop Talbot and the bank manager.

24:58.469 --> 24:59.629
If you're not too busy.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.989
I'll give them
my immediate attention.

25:07.349 --> 25:08.509
Ignatius.

25:09.589 --> 25:10.909
Beg your pardon?

25:10.949 --> 25:14.069
Dress suiting a saint.
It's an anagram.

25:14.109 --> 25:15.629
Hello?

25:15.669 --> 25:18.309
Of course it is.
You're a genius, Mrs M!

25:18.349 --> 25:20.269
Father! May we have a word, please?

25:21.989 --> 25:23.149
In private.

25:32.789 --> 25:35.589
Vivian got his hands on some
negatives,

25:35.629 --> 25:40.389
taken when I was younger and
considerably less wise.

25:43.549 --> 25:45.229
And which...

25:45.269 --> 25:47.709
You can speak
freely in front of Father Brown.

25:49.229 --> 25:51.589
And which involved another man.

25:51.629 --> 25:56.469
I thought you might like some tea
and one of my scones.

25:56.509 --> 25:58.469
How wonderful, Bridget.

25:58.509 --> 26:00.389
Shall I be mother...?

26:00.429 --> 26:02.029
I can manage.

26:02.069 --> 26:04.149
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.

26:04.189 --> 26:05.549
But I....

26:08.229 --> 26:10.229
So, you see what this means, Father.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.669
Yes.

26:11.709 --> 26:14.229
Inspector Mallory's got
the bit between the teeth,

26:14.269 --> 26:17.189
and he won't rest
until he finds the negatives.

26:17.229 --> 26:20.229
Even if he can't make a murder
charge stick you face ruin...

26:21.269 --> 26:22.669
..and imprisonment.

26:22.709 --> 26:24.069
I'll kill myself first.

26:24.109 --> 26:25.509
That won't be necessary.

26:25.549 --> 26:28.549
Because if Inspector Mallory finds
the real killer,

26:28.589 --> 26:29.949
he'll call off the hunt.

26:38.749 --> 26:40.309
What can I do for you, Father?

26:41.709 --> 26:42.589
May I?

26:51.949 --> 26:55.549
I was wondering if you'd like
prayers said for you husband's soul.

26:56.829 --> 26:59.989
Vivian didn't have a soul
and he wasn't a Catholic.

27:00.029 --> 27:01.629
But you are.

27:01.669 --> 27:05.229
And you of all people should know
that he may have been seeking God

27:05.269 --> 27:06.589
up to the moment of death.

27:08.389 --> 27:10.389
I assure you he'd have hated it.

27:11.989 --> 27:13.829
In which case, you have my blessing.

27:15.069 --> 27:16.669
He was your husband.

27:16.709 --> 27:19.109
He broke every one of
our wedding vows -

27:19.149 --> 27:21.949
except for "till death do us part".
Did you kill him?

27:24.829 --> 27:25.829
Sadly, no.

27:27.469 --> 27:30.069
But you did send the death threats.

27:30.109 --> 27:31.549
Why would you say that? Arulus.

27:33.989 --> 27:36.949
It's an anagram. You couldn't resist
using your real name.

27:38.869 --> 27:40.669
"Ursula" Donnell.

27:40.709 --> 27:43.189
Well, to be sure,
I wouldn't be lying

27:43.229 --> 27:44.709
to a man of the cloth.

27:47.469 --> 27:49.349
It was only me little joke

27:49.389 --> 27:52.429
because I knew it would scare
the bejesus out of him.

27:52.469 --> 27:54.469
And it worked.

27:54.509 --> 27:56.309
Like all bullies he was a coward.

27:57.549 --> 28:00.149
That much hatred will
destroy your soul.

28:00.189 --> 28:03.389
It's too late for that.
I sold it to the devil.

28:03.429 --> 28:06.069
And the irony is I did it for God.

28:06.109 --> 28:07.229
How so?

28:08.629 --> 28:10.909
SHE SIGHS

28:10.949 --> 28:15.749
Vivian had a fearsome reputation.
King of the casting couch.

28:15.789 --> 28:19.109
They said he used to have
a hidden camera in his office

28:19.149 --> 28:21.269
to film his conquests.

28:21.309 --> 28:26.029
I was 17 years old and
fresh out of convent school.

28:26.069 --> 28:28.389
And I turned him down.

28:28.429 --> 28:30.549
That must have taken
a lot of courage.

28:32.269 --> 28:34.629
It was my downfall.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.709
No-one says no to Vivian.

28:38.949 --> 28:42.589
Now conquest wasn't enough,
he wanted ownership.

28:42.629 --> 28:48.309
And a wedding ring proved both cheap
currency and good publicity.

28:48.349 --> 28:50.109
So you see, Father,

28:50.149 --> 28:53.349
that's where being a good little
Catholic girl got me.

28:53.389 --> 28:56.069
And now...

28:56.109 --> 28:57.429
I am lost.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.469
No, no.

29:01.309 --> 29:03.069
God doesn't give up that easily.

29:04.669 --> 29:06.949
I'm past penance,
so what do you suggest?

29:08.669 --> 29:09.829
I think...

29:11.829 --> 29:14.709
..that you should love yourself,
as much as He loves you.

29:17.669 --> 29:20.069
Miss Fontaine,
we're ready for you on set.

29:26.309 --> 29:28.509
What's this. A deputation?

29:28.549 --> 29:30.709
My Universal offer is
still on the table.

29:30.749 --> 29:32.589
We want to be
released from our contracts

29:32.629 --> 29:34.189
when the Demon Brides is finished.

29:34.229 --> 29:36.589
Both of you? I'm going with him.

29:36.629 --> 29:39.269
You think I'd want to stay here
after everything that's happened?

29:39.309 --> 29:41.309
Consider yourself terminated.

29:41.349 --> 29:44.149
But you, Billy, you're special.

29:44.189 --> 29:48.629
Too damn good for Cardinal,
but why should I let you go?

29:48.669 --> 29:50.829
Because you're not your husband.

29:53.189 --> 29:54.309
Go, then.

29:55.549 --> 29:56.949
As for her, good riddance.

29:58.389 --> 29:59.829
We're going to Hollywood.

29:59.869 --> 30:01.029
We sure are, pardner!

30:08.629 --> 30:10.269
What are you doing here, Father?

30:10.309 --> 30:12.229
Don't answer that. Stupid question.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.189
And action.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.229
Right, Bebe.

30:15.269 --> 30:18.069
Virginia begins to undress,
ready for her wedding night.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.109
She's all alone, or so she thinks.

30:20.149 --> 30:21.949
Pan off to the painting. That's it.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.989
Action, Cooper! Eyes. Aye, aye!

30:25.029 --> 30:28.229
Good, good. And...cut!

30:28.269 --> 30:29.389
Sid. With me.

30:41.309 --> 30:42.229
So...

30:44.389 --> 30:45.709
What are we looking for?

30:53.789 --> 30:56.469
Vivian Wolsey was a voyeur...

30:57.709 --> 31:00.509
..and a leopard doesn't change
his spots.

31:00.549 --> 31:01.829
Sorry. You've lost me.

31:03.589 --> 31:06.189
Why isn't the screen facing
the projector?

31:08.509 --> 31:09.509
Hmm.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.789
Film is an illusion.

31:14.189 --> 31:16.949
And he was a master of making
the real look fake...

31:18.709 --> 31:20.029
..and the fake look real.

31:46.229 --> 31:47.549
Shut the door, please, Sid.

31:59.149 --> 32:02.549
I assume you know someone who can
develop this film.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.069
A hidden camera? What on earth for?

32:06.269 --> 32:07.549
Oh, dear God.

32:09.189 --> 32:10.069
That was quick.

32:11.229 --> 32:12.789
I called in a favour.

32:12.829 --> 32:15.109
So, at three o'clock,
Paulette Swain visits the boss

32:15.149 --> 32:17.269
to sign for a starring role
in his next movie.

32:17.309 --> 32:19.709
And an hour later, he was dead.

32:19.749 --> 32:22.189
The village hall projector's
ready in the study.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.309
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.

32:28.869 --> 32:30.509
And cut!

32:30.549 --> 32:31.709
Check the gate!

32:31.749 --> 32:35.949
Thank you very much, Paulette,
that was a thing of beauty.

32:37.429 --> 32:39.069
Gate clear!

32:39.109 --> 32:39.949
Print it!

32:41.709 --> 32:43.149
Mrs Wolsey.

32:43.189 --> 32:46.949
I have a warrant to search
your husband's personal files.

32:46.989 --> 32:49.869
I take that to mean you are no
closer to finding his killer.

32:51.429 --> 32:52.829
I wouldn't say that, Madam.

33:00.349 --> 33:01.669
Set up for scene 14!

33:07.189 --> 33:08.509
To my leading lady.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.909
I don't understand.

33:10.949 --> 33:13.389
No-one's ever believed in me
like this, Vivian.

33:13.429 --> 33:15.389
I don't know how to thank you.

33:15.429 --> 33:16.949
You're not that innocent.

33:20.069 --> 33:22.149
Darling, the camera loves you.

33:23.949 --> 33:25.949
And I'm going to make you a star.

33:28.149 --> 33:30.429
No, no! I've changed my...

33:30.469 --> 33:32.349
No! Get off!

33:32.389 --> 33:35.669
Good! A little bit of resistance,
I like that.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.909
No, no, I won't!

33:38.709 --> 33:40.589
Oh, no, you don't.

33:43.069 --> 33:46.629
Nothing in this life is free.

33:46.669 --> 33:49.669
I own you now!

33:49.709 --> 33:51.669
Ah!

33:57.229 --> 33:59.509
Why haven't you taken
this to the police?

34:00.829 --> 34:03.349
Because it's not the whole story.

34:03.389 --> 34:04.989
What happened afterwards -

34:05.029 --> 34:08.228
the mask,
the desecration of the body -

34:08.268 --> 34:10.949
wasn't the act of a frightened
young woman.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.989
It was cool-headed,
it was meditated.

34:15.029 --> 34:17.389
It required strength,

34:17.429 --> 34:18.389
imagination...

34:20.029 --> 34:22.029
..a flair for the dramatic.

34:22.069 --> 34:24.029
In fact, it required a writer.

34:26.309 --> 34:27.509
I don't deny it was me.

34:31.829 --> 34:34.629
I killed him. Oh, God,
what's going to happen to me?

34:38.829 --> 34:41.509
Nothing. Go, clean yourself up.

34:41.549 --> 34:44.188
Say nothing and trust me.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.469
Trust me and no-one will know
anything. Go!

34:58.869 --> 35:00.069
Have we a key to this?

35:00.109 --> 35:02.869
No, sir. But I can find
the secretary and ask.

35:09.989 --> 35:13.189
Seems our Mr Wolsey liked
to eavesdrop.

35:13.229 --> 35:15.429
'You arranged the body

35:15.469 --> 35:17.549
'and then tried to put
the blame on Arulus.'

35:17.589 --> 35:19.269
Isn't that Father...? Ssh!

35:19.309 --> 35:22.349
'So now you know the truth.
What are you going to do?'

35:22.389 --> 35:24.389
But this isn't the truth.

35:24.429 --> 35:25.829
Not even half of it.

35:27.869 --> 35:30.869
I expect you wondered where
this had got to.

35:30.909 --> 35:32.069
What the hell is that?

35:33.309 --> 35:37.429
"At first," Dostoevsky said,
"art imitates life.

35:38.949 --> 35:41.229
"Then life imitates art.

35:42.549 --> 35:47.909
"Then life takes its very
existence from art."

35:47.949 --> 35:50.189
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

35:53.669 --> 35:56.469
It's all in here, isn't it, Billy?

35:58.749 --> 36:02.149
The beautiful young innocent
in thrall to the devil.

36:02.189 --> 36:06.189
The heroic young scribe who rescues
her by killing the demon.

36:08.789 --> 36:12.389
"Henry flung the holy water
in Lord Hellion's face

36:12.429 --> 36:16.189
"and it solidified like wax,
suffocating his screams."

36:18.189 --> 36:22.269
If you're praying for his soul then
you're wasting your time.

36:22.309 --> 36:25.949
'I suppose you removed its partner
when you took off the mask.'

36:28.389 --> 36:29.389
'I don't understand.'

36:31.269 --> 36:33.469
You didn't kill Vivian.

36:33.509 --> 36:36.509
He was alive when you left the room.

36:37.549 --> 36:39.549
Oh, God,
what's going to happen to me?

36:41.989 --> 36:44.949
Nothing. Go, clean yourself up.

36:44.989 --> 36:47.669
Say nothing and trust me.

36:47.709 --> 36:50.069
Trust me
and no-one will know anything. Go!

36:53.629 --> 36:57.509
The impediment to all your hopes
injured, but not fatally.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.149
So you decided to finish the job.

37:05.549 --> 37:07.589
Wax to suffocate a demon.

37:09.189 --> 37:11.709
A simple matter of blocking
up the air holes.

37:13.269 --> 37:19.949
'And then you locked the door and
waited while he suffocated to death.'

37:19.989 --> 37:21.349
He's good, isn't he, sir?

37:21.389 --> 37:23.229
I hope you're taking this down.

37:23.269 --> 37:26.869
'If you ever leave the Priesthood,
I see a future for you as a writer.'

37:26.909 --> 37:29.109
'But this isn't a work
of imagination.

37:29.149 --> 37:32.749
'I'm sure that if the police fit
this to the mask

37:32.789 --> 37:34.629
'they'll find it exact...'

37:36.349 --> 37:39.589
'What are you doing!?'
Let's go, Sergeant.

37:39.629 --> 37:42.949
Erm, where to, sir? Am I psychic?!

37:42.989 --> 37:46.349
Get every available man
and spread out till we find them.

37:52.109 --> 37:54.469
Help! Somebody help me!

37:54.509 --> 37:55.829
With me!

37:55.869 --> 37:57.949
Oh! Oh!

37:57.989 --> 37:59.589
Oh, for God's sake!

38:00.789 --> 38:02.309
Begging your pardon, Madam.

38:06.069 --> 38:07.869
Goodfellow! Ma'am.

38:11.069 --> 38:15.189
Celluloid.
It'll go up like dynamite.

38:15.229 --> 38:16.789
An unfortunate accident.

38:16.829 --> 38:19.709
You're crazy. You made me
think that I was a murderer.

38:19.749 --> 38:23.349
Vivian had us both trapped.
I saw a way of escape.

38:23.389 --> 38:24.709
I did it for us.

38:24.749 --> 38:26.629
There is no us, Billy.

38:26.669 --> 38:29.589
We're going to Hollywood.
You said you'd come with me.

38:29.629 --> 38:31.869
Only to escape my crime.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.309
I needed to get as far
from here as possible.

38:34.349 --> 38:36.949
Lies! You wanted to be with me.

38:36.989 --> 38:39.229
I was grateful. That's all.

38:40.629 --> 38:42.269
I killed that devil for you.

38:43.469 --> 38:45.349
You killed him for yourself.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.029
And now you are the demon.

38:48.229 --> 38:49.469
It's all over, Billy.

38:50.949 --> 38:53.189
But it's not too late
to save your soul.

38:54.589 --> 38:56.269
My soul doesn't belong to me
any more.

38:58.589 --> 38:59.909
You can change your mind.

39:01.869 --> 39:02.749
Go to hell, Billy.

39:04.829 --> 39:05.989
Then you go together.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.389
I'll have that.

39:12.429 --> 39:14.509
You're under arrest.
You are not obliged to speak.

39:14.549 --> 39:15.549
Get off me!

39:18.709 --> 39:20.989
You're lucky I was here, Padre.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.229
Thank you.

39:24.509 --> 39:25.509
Thank you.

39:29.629 --> 39:31.989
And action!

39:41.589 --> 39:43.589
"Save me, Henry..."

39:43.629 --> 39:45.429
Save me, Henry.

39:45.469 --> 39:48.069
My hero, Henry.

39:48.109 --> 39:52.309
Can you explain to me
why I am spouting these inanities?

39:52.349 --> 39:54.469
Because it's the end of the movie.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.069
Well, I want a different ending.

40:12.069 --> 40:15.389
Given the evidence on film,
I doubt charges will be pressed.

40:20.789 --> 40:22.949
You're no good to anyone
frozen to death.

40:24.709 --> 40:27.669
At least your photos are still
undiscovered.

40:27.709 --> 40:31.109
Until they fall into a different
pair of wrong hands.

40:31.149 --> 40:33.989
Well, in a manner of speaking,
they already have.

40:34.029 --> 40:36.989
Vivian's secret cubbyhole
contained more than a camera.

40:37.029 --> 40:38.629
So where are they now?

40:40.149 --> 40:43.309
Well, I suppose you'd call it
tampering with the evidence.

40:43.349 --> 40:44.949
I burnt the negatives.

40:44.989 --> 40:46.829
It seemed the prudent thing to do.

40:47.989 --> 40:51.189
That is remarkable. I don't know
how to thank you, Father.

40:53.269 --> 40:56.109
Ah! Well, there is something.

41:27.469 --> 41:29.829
"Directed by Bebe Fontaine."

41:29.869 --> 41:33.069
Well, Rex was a liability,
so someone had to.

41:33.109 --> 41:35.749
Turns out it's much more fun
than acting.

41:35.789 --> 41:37.749
And if Muriel Box can do it...

41:37.789 --> 41:40.269
A woman director. I say.

41:40.309 --> 41:43.389
Cardinal's next production will
star Paulette Swain. Ah!

41:47.109 --> 41:50.549
I'm glad to see you have
put your past behind you.

41:50.589 --> 41:53.029
Well, we had more in common
than I realised.

41:53.069 --> 41:55.509
Any girl that says no to
Vivian has my respect.

41:55.549 --> 41:58.229
Our leading ladies are required
for their photocall

41:58.269 --> 42:00.629
but I do hope the rest of you
enjoy the movie.

42:00.669 --> 42:02.589
Oh, yes.

42:02.629 --> 42:04.109
Thank you.

42:04.149 --> 42:06.989
Thank you so much for inviting us.

42:07.029 --> 42:09.989
It was the least I could do, Father.

42:10.029 --> 42:11.629
You have my eternal gratitude.

42:15.789 --> 42:18.029
Eternal gratitude for what exactly?

42:20.429 --> 42:24.029
Oh, Father, I know how
you like to keep things to yourself

42:24.069 --> 42:26.069
but I'm curious to know the secret

42:26.109 --> 42:28.909
that is fit for everyone
else's ears but mine.

42:31.429 --> 42:33.629
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

42:33.669 --> 42:35.429
The truth is...

42:35.469 --> 42:39.469
Father Brown helped Rex recover
some...photographs.

42:39.509 --> 42:41.509
And you couldn't tell me
that because...?

42:41.549 --> 42:43.989
Because we didn't want
to disappoint you.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.949
Cos the other party involved was,

42:46.989 --> 42:49.029
I'm sorry to say...

42:49.069 --> 42:50.309
married.

42:51.909 --> 42:53.989
Not...

42:54.029 --> 42:57.789
Not Lana Turner.
There have been rumours.

42:57.829 --> 42:59.869
My lips are sealed.

42:59.909 --> 43:03.429
And I know I can rely on you to be
the soul of discretion, Mrs M -

43:03.469 --> 43:07.109
after all, you're not one to gossip.

43:07.149 --> 43:08.349
Sidney.

43:24.469 --> 43:26.629
Virginia. Henry!

43:36.269 --> 43:37.749
What kept you?

43:37.789 --> 43:39.829
I had to wait for reinforcements.
