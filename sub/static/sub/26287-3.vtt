No, a different situation.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.160
My dad called.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.450
And he is coming to L.A.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.700
for a few days.
When?

02:16.700 --> 02:17.910
Well, he is coming today.

Today?!
Listen, I didn’t
want to tell you

02:20.040 --> 02:22.200
because I did not want
to ruin your week.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.950
You invited him to my 30th?

02:23.950 --> 02:24.750
He invited himself.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.750
And, honey, he just wants
to be supportive.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.830
He is rearranging a lot
of things to be here.

02:30.830 --> 02:34.870

he’ll tell us all about them.

How I get with him?
The way you get.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.040
He’s always trying
to show me up.

02:49.040 --> 02:49.700
Our wedding.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.290
That was a beautiful toast.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.120
During our vows.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.200
Who interrupts the groom
to give a toast?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
He always tries

02:56.200 --> 02:58.160
to steal my thunder.
Really?

02:58.160 --> 03:00.660
And you know he does.
Roger. He doesn’t need

03:00.660 --> 03:01.160
to steal your thunder

03:01.160 --> 03:04.250
because he was a federal judge.
Federal judge.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.200
I know. I can’t forget.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.000
You know why?
Because he won’t let me.

03:09.830 --> 03:12.200
That’s him.

03:12.200 --> 03:17.120
I bet you five dollars he

03:21.040 --> 03:24.330

03:25.620 --> 03:27.790

that you’re here

03:31.200 --> 03:33.290

Are you kidding?

03:33.290 --> 03:33.580
I wouldn’t miss it.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.700
30 years in the same place,
that’s quite an achievement.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.750

03:38.750 --> 03:40.370

03:40.370 --> 03:42.750
Oh, the big book tour.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.700
Roger, have I got
a treat for you.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.620
Really?
I wrote down a few
thoughts on the plane.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.000
And it would be my pleasure

03:50.000 --> 03:52.200
to present your little plaque
to you tomorrow.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.330
Yeah, well, you know what?
That’s...

03:54.330 --> 03:56.330
Such a generous offer, Daddy.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.330
Wh... Right?
Such a gener...

03:57.330 --> 04:00.450
But, however, we, uh,
unfortunately,

04:00.450 --> 04:03.950
just, uh, locked
in a presenter. Yep.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.160
Uh, bad timing.
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

04:06.160 --> 04:06.910
Who’d you line up?

04:06.910 --> 04:10.290
It’s...
It’s not finalized yet,

04:10.290 --> 04:13.200
and you know I’m supposed to be
kind of hush-hush about it,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.750
but, um, it’s the mayor.
Mm-hmm.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.200
Oh.
Right.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.660
The mayor.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.290
Well, in that case,

04:20.290 --> 04:21.790
objection overruled,

04:21.790 --> 04:22.870
as I’ve been known to say.

04:22.870 --> 04:27.120
:
Because you’re a federal judge.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.500
Natalie.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.160
Can I...?

04:35.160 --> 04:37.290
Yes, please. Come in.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.370
So, what do you think?

04:42.370 --> 04:43.290
It’s not so bad, right?

04:43.290 --> 04:46.580
Yeah. Uh, I know I’m
a few minutes early,

04:46.580 --> 04:48.790
but Andrew wanted
to beat the traffic.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.250
Andy the proctologist?

04:50.250 --> 04:50.700
Anesthesiologist.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.750
Right. Right. The guy who
puts everyone to sleep.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.950
So how’s Maya?
Is she, uh, excited

04:56.950 --> 04:59.330
about her first night
in the motel?

04:59.330 --> 05:00.290
Um, yeah.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.160
Sort of.
Look, it’s not you.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.750
She just has trouble
sleeping in unfamiliar places.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.410
Yeah, I know.
That’s why I got her

05:06.410 --> 05:09.000
the same sheets
from her bed at home.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.160
My Little Pony?

05:11.160 --> 05:14.870
Cole, she hasn’t had
these sheets in years.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.080
Yeah.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.250
Why would she?

05:17.250 --> 05:18.160
That’s so silly.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.200
Yeah.
They’re comfy, though.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.330
So, Maddie’s mom is dropping her
at your office after school.

05:22.330 --> 05:26.580
These are her PJs,
inhaler and allergy meds.

05:27.700 --> 05:31.160
Look, Ojai is just
a couple of hours away,

05:31.160 --> 05:32.330
so if anything happens...

05:32.330 --> 05:34.120
Nothing’s gonna happen.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.500
I got this.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.040
Okay.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.250
You know, if something’s
going on with you,

05:39.250 --> 05:40.910
or you’re not ready...

05:40.910 --> 05:42.580
She’s my daughter, okay?

05:42.580 --> 05:43.870
I can handle one night.

05:43.870 --> 05:47.120
You go and party
your ass off with Andy,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.410
the proctologist.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.830
Anesthesiologist.

05:49.830 --> 05:50.830
Proctologist.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.120
Anesthesiologist.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.950
Proctologist.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.580
Morning, Roger.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.250
We got a gunshot victim.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.120
Single bullet
to the chest.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.830
What are you doing?

06:08.830 --> 06:10.620
Telling you about the case.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.750
Yeah, but you don’t
just dive in.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.450
We got to banter a little.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.290
You know, grease the
wheel, prime the pump.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.790
Share some things
on your mind.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.620
Is he for real?

06:21.620 --> 06:22.870
Unfortunately.

06:22.870 --> 06:25.290
Oh, here’s something.

06:25.290 --> 06:25.660
I just found out

06:25.660 --> 06:27.370
that my father-in-law
is staying with us.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.000
Well, that’s funny,
my daughter’s staying with me.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.910
No, no.
You don’t

06:31.910 --> 06:34.410
change topics
mid-banter.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.700
You have to wait for the lull.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.700
Bailey, help me out here.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.370
You do have to wait
for the lull.

06:40.370 --> 06:41.330
Wow. So many rules.

06:41.330 --> 06:44.120
Okay, you know what?
Let’s just dive in.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.000
Bailey, what do we got?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.040
All right,
our victim is Larry Mandel.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.000
Worked at a restaurant
around the corner.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.750
This morning, out of the blue,
he decides to quit.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.200
Walks out and employees
hear a gunshot.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.700
As if someone’s waiting for him.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.120
Sobriety medallion.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.830
BAILEY:
Sober living and halfway houses
give those out.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.120
Cole, I know
that you think banter

07:03.120 --> 07:04.660
is just idle chatter,

07:04.660 --> 07:06.120
but it’s not.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.410
It’s communing, listening,

07:07.410 --> 07:09.910
creating a rapport.
Hey, look at that, Roger--

07:09.910 --> 07:10.790
today’s lottery drawing.

07:10.790 --> 07:16.540
He doesn’t get the concept
of the lull.

07:16.790 --> 07:20.540
Next two numbers
are 40 and 47.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.660
How the hell did you do that?

07:26.660 --> 07:30.620
Looks like
Larry’s number came up.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.580
♪ ♪

07:38.450 --> 07:40.830
He had the winning numbers
written on his arm.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.450
Killer must’ve
grabbed the ticket.

07:42.450 --> 07:43.950
So the theory is
somebody rigged the lottery.

07:43.950 --> 07:46.580
Or there’s a special
sharpie out there

07:46.580 --> 07:48.120
that can predict the future.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.330
Magic sharpie theory.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.540
Well, let’s start digging.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.200
Is there something else?

07:55.200 --> 07:57.370
Actually, yeah.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.330
Okay, you know how tomorrow
is my 30th?
Mm.

08:01.330 --> 08:02.830
Who’s presenting the plaque?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.830
No one. The plaque’s
just kind of there.

08:04.830 --> 08:07.620
Okay, good. Because you’re
friends with the mayor, right?
Roger.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.040
No offense, but if I’m gonna
call in a favor to the mayor,

08:10.040 --> 08:12.910
it’s not gonna be
to present you with a plaque.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.160
What’s going on?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.250
Trish’s dad is in town.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.620
The judge is here?
I love him.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.120
Former judge.
Not a judge anymore.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.410
Problem solved;
have Don do it.

08:20.410 --> 08:23.000
I still get misty when I think
about his toast at your wedding.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.330
"Love is like a painting
that’s never finished."

08:26.330 --> 08:27.540
That toast is the exact reason

08:27.540 --> 08:28.450
why Don can’t speak
at my ceremony.

08:28.450 --> 08:32.620
He’s a shameless spotlight thief
whose mission in life
Wh... Oh, come on.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.540
is to make me look this small
in front of Trish.

08:35.540 --> 08:38.450
Roger, with family,
generosity of spirit

08:38.450 --> 08:40.200
is our most valuable resource.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.250
Do you know where
I heard that?

08:41.250 --> 08:44.540
If you say Don’s toast,
I might have to shoot you.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.250
I’ll make some calls.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.200
Thank you.
Thank you.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.330
It was Don’s toast.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.200
We call this
the bullpen.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.910
It’s cool, right?

08:54.910 --> 08:58.660
And this is Daddy’s desk.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.830
And this is my mug.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.410
Yeah, I’ve seen a mug before.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.700
Okay. So, uh...

09:04.700 --> 09:08.200
How about I, uh, take you
for a tour in the precinct?

09:08.200 --> 09:11.080
I just want to do my homework.

09:12.450 --> 09:15.500
Oh, studious.
I like it.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.910
What subject?

09:16.910 --> 09:17.950
Why do you care?

09:17.950 --> 09:20.000
Well, because I’m your dad

09:20.000 --> 09:21.910
and dads care about
these things.

09:21.910 --> 09:25.330
I don’t know. Math.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.950
Well, is it math or not?

09:27.950 --> 09:29.080
Yeah.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.700
Why didn’t you
just say math?

09:31.700 --> 09:32.870
I don’t know.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.120
Should we start over?

09:35.120 --> 09:36.000
Did I do something wrong here?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.120
’Cause the last time you spent
the night, it was so fun.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.790
Dad. I was nine.

09:40.790 --> 09:41.750
That was a long time ago.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.250
BAILEY:
Hey, Cole, I’ve got something.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.370
Rocco Ricci.
Lived in a halfway house

09:46.370 --> 09:47.540
with our dead
dishwasher.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.250
And he won the lottery
six months ago.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.910
Can’t be a coincidence.

09:50.910 --> 09:52.330
Murtaugh wants
to pick him up now.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.120
Already? Maya just got here.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.000
I don’t need a babysitter, Dad.
I’m 12.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.500
Okay, I know, but I just don’t
want anything to happen to you.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.540
I’m in a police station.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.410
Literally the safest place
I could be.

10:03.410 --> 10:06.200
Okay, well,
you have my cell, right?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.660
I’m gonna be back soon.

10:07.660 --> 10:10.500
And I just want to say that,
Maya, having you here,

10:10.500 --> 10:12.200
it is great.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.120
It’s a nightmare.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.120
Put me in a room with
a guerilla insurgent

10:16.120 --> 10:17.540
and I can break him,
no problem.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.290
Can’t crack my
12-year-old daughter.

10:19.290 --> 10:21.580
Well, see,
that’s your first mistake.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.450
You underestimate
the enemy.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.870
12’s tough.
Not quite an adult,

10:25.870 --> 10:28.080
hate to be treated
like a kid.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.330
I’m drowning, man.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.160
What do I do?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.870
There’s nothing you can do.

10:32.870 --> 10:35.080
She’s gonna hate you
till she’s 16.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.410
And then she’ll need money.

10:36.410 --> 10:38.540
No, I’m not giving up yet.

10:38.540 --> 10:40.660
All I need is a little luck.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.120
Ha. Good luck with luck.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.950
There’s no such thing as luck.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.200
Life is just a slew

10:45.200 --> 10:47.120
of random,
meaningless events,

10:47.120 --> 10:51.580
one after the other,
interrupted by Don.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.790
Great pep talk, Roger.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.200
So Bailey says this Rocco
guy lived with Larry

10:58.200 --> 11:00.160
in a halfway house
six months ago,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.660
then he wins the lottery
and moves here.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.200
Must’ve cost a fortune.
Not surprised.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.250
Statistically,
most lottery winners

11:06.250 --> 11:08.120
end up broke within five years.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.040
Aren’t you a
ray of sunshine.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.450
It’s true.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.410
LAPD!

11:33.410 --> 11:35.370
Drop him! Now!

11:48.540 --> 11:51.450
I got him!
Get the little guy.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.580
Drop it, or he dies.

12:28.950 --> 12:31.950
Hey, don’t shoot, man.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.410
I’m getting a plaque tomorrow.

12:46.950 --> 12:48.790
Oh, man!

12:50.830 --> 12:53.290
And you don’t believe in luck?

12:56.050 --> 12:57.060
Any luck IDing the body?

12:57.260 --> 12:59.390
I sent the photos to gang unit
so they can decode these tats.

12:59.390 --> 13:02.550
Nothing yet.
Oh, they’re Eastside AP.

13:02.550 --> 13:03.970
Says it on his arm.

13:03.970 --> 13:05.510
You speak Armenian?

13:05.510 --> 13:07.850
No. I can read it a little bit.

13:07.850 --> 13:08.300
Whoa, who are they?

13:08.300 --> 13:11.010
Maya, what are you doing? You
shouldn’t be in here.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.680
Get out. Now.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.220
I just want to see.
How’d he die?

13:14.220 --> 13:17.350
Out now. Okay? Or you’re
gonna be in big trouble.

13:17.350 --> 13:19.260
No. I didn’t do anything.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.010
That’s it.

13:20.010 --> 13:22.300
You’re going back
to the motel.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.600
I’m punishing you.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.010
What does that mean?

13:25.010 --> 13:26.970
Well, it means...

13:28.800 --> 13:30.600
Bailey?
Uh, don’t drag me into this.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.260
Okay, fine. You know what?
You’re going straight to bed.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.100
It’s 4:00. What about dinner?

13:35.100 --> 13:38.300
Well, then dinner first,
and then no dessert.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
I never have dessert.
Then no TV.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.550
No phone.
And then you’re gonna eat

13:42.550 --> 13:44.050
all your vegetables.
Fine.

13:44.050 --> 13:48.220
You know, you suck
at this dad thing.

13:49.510 --> 13:51.470
MURTAUGH:So, Rocco,

13:51.470 --> 13:53.850
who were those guys?
No idea.

13:53.850 --> 13:54.260
But all I can say

13:54.260 --> 13:57.100
is 300 pounds of human
drops out of the sky

13:57.100 --> 13:58.050
and lands on the dude--

13:58.050 --> 13:59.390
you and me,
luckiest guys on Earth.

13:59.390 --> 14:02.550
Don’t forget you were
strangled this morning.
Sure.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.390
But still, I won the lottery.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.800
That’s not luck. You cheated.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.010
I didn’t cheat.

14:08.010 --> 14:08.850
A stranger came up to me in AA,

14:08.850 --> 14:11.220
told me he could give me
numbers, guaranteed winners.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.140
Said all I have to do
is split the jackpot.

14:13.140 --> 14:15.850
This stranger-- did
he give you a name?

14:15.850 --> 14:20.010
Nope. Called himself
my guardian angel.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.470
MURTAUGH:
No.

14:24.470 --> 14:26.800
No, this is not happening.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.100
No, I got...
I got plenty of time for this.
MURTAUGH: Don.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.890
Don, what are you doing here?
I had a meeting

14:30.890 --> 14:33.220
downtown with my publisher,
so I thought I’d pop in.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.550
You didn’t tell
me that the judge

14:35.550 --> 14:36.890
was a published author.

14:36.890 --> 14:37.430
Former judge.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.350
It’s a lifetime honorific.
You know,

14:39.350 --> 14:42.010
like "general"
or-or "president."

14:42.010 --> 14:42.720
California Penal Code,

14:42.720 --> 14:46.220
Pocket Edition.Edited by
the Honorable Donald Bennett.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.140
Oh.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.850
So more editor than an author.

14:49.850 --> 14:52.350
Well, I wrote the foreword,

14:52.350 --> 14:53.600
but Elena Kagan, uh,

14:53.600 --> 14:56.180
I think she called it
groundbreaking.

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
:
"Groundbreaking."

14:57.180 --> 14:59.010
Yeah, listen, Don,

14:59.010 --> 15:00.180
we’re glad you dropped by,

15:00.180 --> 15:03.390
but we’re in the middle
of taking a witness statement.

15:03.390 --> 15:04.140
Yeah, I know. Brooks told me

15:04.140 --> 15:07.970
that you’re, uh,
looking into lottery rigging?

15:07.970 --> 15:08.890
Yeah.

15:08.890 --> 15:09.760
May I make a suggestion?

15:09.760 --> 15:11.970
Not right...
Please, yeah.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.140
Follow the money.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.680
Little phrase I coined
during the days

15:15.680 --> 15:17.970
when I was
on the criminal court bench.

15:17.970 --> 15:18.760
Follow the money?

15:18.760 --> 15:22.350
Follow the money.
It-It means looking into...
I-I know

15:22.350 --> 15:23.010
what it means.

15:23.010 --> 15:26.600
It is the bedrock of
criminal investigation.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.050
Everybody says it.

15:28.050 --> 15:29.600
After I coined it.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.140
I did not
know that.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.680
That is awesome.

15:36.630 --> 15:39.050
COLE:Silent treatment, huh?

15:39.050 --> 15:39.880
Okay.

15:39.880 --> 15:43.920
I lasted a week in a sleep
deprivation box in Caracas,

15:43.920 --> 15:46.710
so this is nothing.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.800
Okay, fine, you’re unpunished.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.000
But you have to talk to me.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.050
Still?

15:56.710 --> 16:01.210
Man, you could teach classes
at Langley.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.880
Texting and driving.
Great example.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.750
I wasn’t.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.840
I was gonna ask you
to read it for me.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.130
Do you mind?
Whatever.

16:14.130 --> 16:14.800
It’s from Murtaugh.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.710
He says he’s got a lead
at the Frabble Shack.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.380
What’s the Frabble Shack?

16:18.380 --> 16:22.590
You don’t know? They have, like,
the best milkshakes in L.A.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.750
Can I come?

16:23.750 --> 16:26.840
Maya, it’s an investigation.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.380
Please?
Wait, hold on,

16:28.380 --> 16:30.920
you actuallywantto
spend time with me?

16:30.920 --> 16:33.130
I want a Frabble.

16:33.130 --> 16:35.750
I’ll take it.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.050
Stay in the car, okay?
Okay.

16:43.550 --> 16:45.880
What flavor do you want?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.000
You decide.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.170
Hey, Dad.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.750
Thanks.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.380
♪ For some ♪

16:54.380 --> 16:56.210
♪ This is all a game... ♪

16:56.210 --> 16:57.500
Excuse me.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.090
Hi. Welcome to Frabble Shack.

17:00.090 --> 17:02.960
Looks like a good
kid. How old is he?

17:02.960 --> 17:03.880
He’s eight.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.340
Tell him not to get any older.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.590
I do, but he just won’t listen.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.630
What can I get you?

17:09.630 --> 17:12.710
I would like two
Strawberry Frabbles.

17:12.710 --> 17:13.300
Biggest you got.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.750
MURTAUGH:
Why don’t you make it three.

17:16.420 --> 17:19.170
Did I just see your daughter

17:19.170 --> 17:20.210
in a car on an investigation?

17:20.210 --> 17:23.050
It’s fine. The morgue
was way worse.

17:23.050 --> 17:24.710
So, we got a lead, or
you just craving dairy?

17:24.710 --> 17:29.500
This is where Rocco would come
meet his, uh, guardian angel.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.000
And the victim’s credit card

17:31.000 --> 17:32.550
was charged here last week.

17:32.550 --> 17:33.880
WOMAN:
Victim?

17:33.880 --> 17:34.800
Did something happen?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.130
Have you seen either
of these two men

17:37.130 --> 17:39.590
in here before?
Uh...

17:39.590 --> 17:40.800
I think so.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.210
Yeah, they-they were meeting
one of our regulars.

17:44.210 --> 17:45.670
Guy’s in here almost every day.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.090
Mateo.
He’s right over there.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.500
COLE:
Mateo. LAPD.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.500
We have a few questions.

17:57.630 --> 18:00.090
Stay in the car.
I got you strawberry.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.710
Hey, that could be evidence.

18:20.710 --> 18:21.630
One of us should go down there

18:21.630 --> 18:22.960
and get it
before it gets run over.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.590
Good call. Thanks, Roger.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.420
No, I don’t... Okay.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.750
Mateo.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.380
Come on down, buddy.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.880
You don’t need to do this.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.590
No, this is what I deserve.

18:36.590 --> 18:39.750
No, whatever you did,
we can talk about this, okay?

18:39.750 --> 18:44.380
Hey, that’s close
enough! Come on!
Okay. Okay, I’m stopping.

18:50.050 --> 18:52.250
Just tell me
what happened.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.590
Is this about Larry?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.670
I didn’t kill him.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.750
But it’s all my fault.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.960
Look, I work for the lottery,
and I tried to make up

19:00.960 --> 19:04.670
for what I did, but it just
made everything worse.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.670
Make up for what?

19:06.670 --> 19:09.210
Come on, just
talk to me,

19:09.210 --> 19:09.960
all right?

19:09.960 --> 19:14.590
30 years on the force,
and it ends like this?

19:19.750 --> 19:20.840
What did you do?

19:20.840 --> 19:23.090
I promise you,
I’ll understand.

19:23.090 --> 19:25.170
I killed someone.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.630
I was drunk.

19:26.630 --> 19:27.840
I shouldn’t
have been driving.

19:27.840 --> 19:31.380
And I’ve been... I’ve been
c-carrying that for years!

19:31.380 --> 19:34.800
Do you even know
what that’s like?

19:34.800 --> 19:35.380
Yes, I do. I do.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.750
Okay?
I’ve killed people, too.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.710
Too many to count.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.050
Not all them
deserved it.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.420
Because of me, a...

19:46.420 --> 19:49.050
nine-year-old boy is dead.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.050
I have to live
with that

19:51.050 --> 19:52.670
every day of my life.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.340
But I live with it.

19:54.340 --> 19:56.630
And so can you.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.750
MAYA:
Dad?

20:00.340 --> 20:01.800
Maya.

20:03.460 --> 20:06.250
MAN: What’s wrong with you?!

20:07.250 --> 20:09.340
What are you doing here?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.710
Maya!

20:19.630 --> 20:21.500
Holy crap.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.130
Hey, Cole,

20:23.130 --> 20:24.460
did you see that?

20:24.460 --> 20:26.670
What are the odds?

20:27.130 --> 20:29.210
COLE:
Maya!

20:31.880 --> 20:34.130
After the accident, I, uh...

20:34.130 --> 20:37.210
changed my name,
and I got clean.

20:37.210 --> 20:41.050
I got a job working IT for
the Lottery Commission

20:41.050 --> 20:44.210
and decided I needed
to make amends, so...

20:44.210 --> 20:47.550
I saw a-a loophole
in the lottery code,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.750
and I started
finding people

20:49.750 --> 20:51.210
who were down on their luck

20:51.210 --> 20:53.460
and giving them winning numbers.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.090
Wow.

20:54.090 --> 20:57.460
You’re like a real-life
Robin Hood.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.670
Except he didn’t keep half.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.710
Rocco said you split
the winnings.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.210
Not with me.
Really?

21:04.210 --> 21:05.710
Then with who?

21:05.710 --> 21:07.840
MATEO:
Um...

21:07.840 --> 21:09.250
Mateo’s alibi checks out.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.880
But he was working
with someone.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.710
Might be our killer.

21:13.710 --> 21:16.130
How’s Maya?

21:16.130 --> 21:17.630
I don’t know.

21:17.630 --> 21:20.630
She was just staring out
the window the whole way back.

21:20.630 --> 21:22.630
Oh, kids are resilient.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.090
I once lost RJ at the zoo.

21:24.090 --> 21:27.670
I found him three hours later
doing laps in the otter tank.

21:27.670 --> 21:30.050
They bounce back,
although that smell

21:30.050 --> 21:32.130
never went away.

21:32.130 --> 21:34.550
No need for the applause.

21:34.550 --> 21:35.090
What happened?

21:35.090 --> 21:37.300
I just got Mateo
to give up his partner.

21:37.300 --> 21:37.630
Were you guys even listening?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.250
I didn’t hear.
I didn’t even know
you were in the room.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.920
Okay, I need
to work with more women.
Wait, wait,

21:42.920 --> 21:44.840
wait, wait.
You gonna tell us

21:44.840 --> 21:46.050
or not?

21:46.050 --> 21:48.590
Who was Mateo working with?

21:51.960 --> 21:56.250
Rowdy Rodney,
Mr. Lottery Commissioner.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.300
Where you going, pal?

21:59.300 --> 22:03.050
Me? Just... headed to the gym.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.550
Ugh. What a relief.

22:04.550 --> 22:06.380
See, Levon here
was thinking that

22:06.380 --> 22:08.460
you were skipping town
with the money you owe us.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.710
You do have our money,
don’t you, buddy?

22:11.710 --> 22:12.880
I had it. I did,

22:12.880 --> 22:15.750
but someone hacked
the account.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.750
The money is... gone.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.960
Gone

22:19.960 --> 22:21.880
’Cause Serj isn’t laughing.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.090
Serj laughs at everything.

22:23.090 --> 22:25.550
Give me time.
I can get it back.

22:25.550 --> 22:27.340
You know, first the loudmouth

22:27.340 --> 22:28.380
dishwasher,
and now this.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.300
Got to tell you, Rodney,
don’t think you’re worth it.

22:31.300 --> 22:34.130
Please. I’ll get
the money. I will.

22:37.340 --> 22:38.670
You see that, Rodney?

22:38.670 --> 22:39.880
The man loves comedy.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.750
Find the money, Rodney.

22:41.750 --> 22:44.750
Next time, no one’s laughing.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.300
Didn’t know what kind
of pizza you like,

22:49.300 --> 22:51.840
so I got you
four different kinds.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.880
I can get you more, though.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.050
I just want
to go to bed.

22:55.050 --> 22:58.380
It’s our only night together.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.420
I thought we could hang, maybe

23:01.420 --> 23:02.420
watch pay-per-view.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.420
You want to hang out?

23:04.420 --> 23:07.130
Fine. Let’s talk.

23:07.130 --> 23:09.630
I want to know
about the people you killed.

23:09.630 --> 23:14.670
Maya, sometimes adults have
to say things that are not true.

23:14.670 --> 23:15.420
So you were lying?

23:15.420 --> 23:17.710
Dad, you worked
in the CIA.

23:17.710 --> 23:19.380
I know you’re not perfect.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.500
Maya, can we just drop it?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.300
That kid,

23:23.300 --> 23:25.300
the one who died--

23:25.300 --> 23:27.920
what was his name?

23:31.090 --> 23:32.000
Hey, how about a night swim?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.130
I’ll bet your mom
never lets you do that.

23:34.130 --> 23:36.090
You’re ignoring me.
Very mature.

23:36.090 --> 23:38.630
I’m not ignoring you.
Then talk to me.

23:38.630 --> 23:41.630
I am. I will. I just...

23:41.630 --> 23:43.960
I...

23:45.750 --> 23:48.300
I have to go to the bathroom.

24:04.550 --> 24:05.340
Dad?

24:05.340 --> 24:10.130
Come on. You can’t
hide in there forever.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.710
I just want
to know what happened.

24:22.710 --> 24:25.050
WOMAN:Get up!

24:26.210 --> 24:27.380
Get up now!

24:27.380 --> 24:29.750
WOMAN:He’s gone.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.800
You got to let go.

24:36.670 --> 24:37.840
Fine.

24:37.840 --> 24:41.880
Guess I’ll just keep
making it up in my head.

24:47.670 --> 24:49.750
His name was Hanni.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.130
I called him Velcro.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.750
He, uh...

24:53.750 --> 24:56.710
He used to follow me everywhere.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.550
Never let me
get away with anything.

25:01.550 --> 25:04.550
Lot like you.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.000
How’d he die?

25:15.380 --> 25:17.710
Dad?

25:28.550 --> 25:30.960
He was shot.

25:32.590 --> 25:35.750
I didn’t see him there, but...

25:36.880 --> 25:39.960
...he was there because of me.

25:47.050 --> 25:50.590
Have you ever
killed anyone on purpose?

25:52.750 --> 25:55.130
I have.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.420
It was part
of the job.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.300
I never hurt anyone
unless I had to.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.920
To protect people.

26:06.090 --> 26:09.550
Do you understand?

26:10.920 --> 26:13.460
I think so.

26:16.380 --> 26:19.840
You’re one of the good guys,
right?

26:19.840 --> 26:22.880
I try to be, Maya.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.630
I really try.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.210
Any more questions?

26:31.050 --> 26:35.840
Yeah. We still going
for a night swim?

26:42.210 --> 26:45.250
Hey, hope nobody’s hungry.

26:46.050 --> 26:46.920
I see no one’s hungry.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.130
Baby, I didn’t know you
were coming for dinner.

26:49.130 --> 26:51.670
Yeah.
Dad said he saw you at work,
and you were working

26:51.670 --> 26:53.250
through dinner.
DON:
Well, I just

26:53.250 --> 26:54.300
assumed
you’d be running down leads

26:54.300 --> 26:55.920
after I pointed you
in the right direction

26:55.920 --> 26:57.380
on your, uh...
After you did what now?

26:57.380 --> 26:59.840
Yeah, Pop-Pop’s just
telling us how he helped you.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.340
Judge, jury and
executioner.

27:00.340 --> 27:03.460
Yeah, baby, sit down.
We’ll get a plate.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.170
DON:
Yeah, plenty of food.

27:05.170 --> 27:06.050
Grab a seat, Roger.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.960
Actually, that’s
my seat right there.

27:09.130 --> 27:12.000
You know what? I want
to take you guys out to dinner

27:12.000 --> 27:13.880
tomorrow after
the ceremony.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.750
I talked to
Wolfgang, and, uh,

27:15.750 --> 27:17.250
he said we could
have the back room.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.460
Is the mayor going
to be joining us?

27:20.460 --> 27:21.090
I don’t know.

27:21.090 --> 27:23.050
The mayor’s coming
to your shindig?
It’s pending.

27:23.050 --> 27:25.710
Don’t tell me he’s canceling
at the last minute.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.420
I mean, that’s not right.

27:26.420 --> 27:27.250
He’s a friend of mine.
Let me give him a call.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.710
Dad, Daddy.
No, don’t, don’t, don’t.
Don’t. Don’t. It’s okay.

27:29.710 --> 27:33.210
You only have one 30th.
That’s disrespectful.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.500
I got to call.
Hey, look, look.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.380
Hey, ah, okay,
the mayor’s not coming.

27:37.380 --> 27:38.300
You happy?

27:38.300 --> 27:40.380
He never was coming.

27:40.380 --> 27:42.460
Why do you always do this?

27:42.460 --> 27:44.090
What is your thing, man?

27:44.090 --> 27:44.840
What

27:44.840 --> 27:47.250
Okay.
You show up, and
you showmeup.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.630
That’s what you do
all the time.

27:48.630 --> 27:49.300
You’re doing it right now.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.170
TRISH: Let’s...
You are sitting in my chair,

27:51.170 --> 27:52.000
you know it’s my chair.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.090
However, you remain
seated in my chair.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.630
Roger, it is not a big deal.

27:56.630 --> 27:58.420
Don, do I come
to your house,

27:58.420 --> 28:00.050
and sit on your throne?

28:00.050 --> 28:01.300
Hmm?
I’m a guest.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.050
Are you actually saying
you want me to move?

28:04.050 --> 28:05.590
Yes!
No, he’s not saying that.

28:05.590 --> 28:07.170
He understands.

28:07.170 --> 28:08.380
Would it kill you

28:08.380 --> 28:12.340
to give me just one thing, man?

28:12.340 --> 28:15.710
One thing!

28:21.670 --> 28:22.500
Oh, no, it’s too cold.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.750
Oh, you think that’s cold?
You should try

28:23.750 --> 28:25.170
freediving
in the Arctic.
You’ve done that?

28:25.170 --> 28:29.050
No. But I’m just saying
you should try it.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.460
Maybe we should go back inside.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.750
What? No way.

28:34.750 --> 28:38.710
A Cole never backs down
from a challenge, okay?

28:38.710 --> 28:40.300
Come on. It’ll be fun.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.420
Come on, Maya.
You can do this.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.840
I know you can.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.500
Ready?

28:46.340 --> 28:48.340
One...

28:48.340 --> 28:50.590
two...

28:50.590 --> 28:52.170
three.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.050
All right!

28:55.050 --> 28:56.630
Nice dive.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.710
Dad?

29:04.710 --> 29:08.880
Okay, you know what else
sounds fun? The emergency room.

29:11.130 --> 29:14.090
Okay, breakfast time.
You got a choice of

29:14.090 --> 29:16.630
nougat, caramel,
gummy... for me.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.210
This is my
breakfast.

29:18.210 --> 29:19.300
Every day.

29:19.300 --> 29:23.000
Maya is gonna be having
muesli and prunes.

29:23.000 --> 29:23.670
Gross.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.710
Cole, can I talk to you
for a second?

29:25.710 --> 29:27.960
Sure.

29:32.630 --> 29:35.800
Okay, listen, I know
I screwed up, all right?

29:35.800 --> 29:38.670
But to be fair, I think
that the "No Diving" signs

29:38.670 --> 29:40.130
at the motel are
not up to code.

29:40.130 --> 29:42.800
Six stitches, Cole,
in her head.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.050
And that’s not even
the worst part.

29:46.050 --> 29:49.000
She told me what happened.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.250
She told you?

29:50.250 --> 29:52.170
Of course. She’s 12.

29:52.170 --> 29:54.960
I think she’s still
working through it.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.670
That’s why I wanted
to come clean, you know?

29:57.670 --> 30:00.670
I wanted to tell her about
the kid and how he died.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.800
Wait. What kid?
What are you talking about?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.420
Wait, what are you
talking about?

30:06.420 --> 30:07.340
She told me she accidentally

30:07.340 --> 30:11.460
wandered into the morgue.
You told her about a dead kid?

30:11.460 --> 30:12.170
No.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.670
I mean, yes, but only
because she overheard me

30:14.670 --> 30:16.380
try to talk down a jumper.

30:16.380 --> 30:16.880
She saw a jumper?!

30:16.880 --> 30:19.590
Wow, this conversation
got away from me fast.

30:19.590 --> 30:21.750
Let me try to explain.
Cole, no.

30:21.750 --> 30:24.250
No, no, no.
You don’t need to explain.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.090
This is my fault.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.750
I should never
have let you watch her.

30:26.750 --> 30:30.300
I ignored my instincts,
which I never do.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.420
I guess I was just
hoping that...

30:33.420 --> 30:35.380
That what?

30:36.130 --> 30:39.250
That you’re someone you’re not.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.670
Permission to
approach the bench?

30:53.670 --> 30:55.420
You may.

30:57.460 --> 30:58.250
You know,

30:58.250 --> 31:01.920
this has been
one of the more...

31:01.920 --> 31:05.300
eventful visits,
has it not?

31:05.300 --> 31:06.300
It has.

31:06.300 --> 31:09.130
And about what Roger
said last night...

31:09.130 --> 31:11.090
No, don’t even
think about it.

31:11.090 --> 31:13.300
He’s a very excitable man.
He is.

31:13.300 --> 31:16.630
And that’s one of the
reasons I love him.

31:17.130 --> 31:19.130
He’s my
husband, Daddy.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.500
Mmm.
And he’s not wrong.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.130
You provoke him.
What?

31:24.130 --> 31:25.500
Daddy, the mayor? You knew

31:25.500 --> 31:28.590
the mayor wasn’t coming to
Roger’s ceremony, because

31:28.590 --> 31:29.710
I told you he wasn’t.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.960
Uh, sweetheart,
uh, uh, I forgot.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.170
No, you did
not forget.

31:33.170 --> 31:34.550
You don’t forget anything.

31:34.550 --> 31:37.050
And I think you know
exactly what you were doing,

31:37.050 --> 31:40.170
even if you
don’t know why.

31:40.170 --> 31:42.170
Daddy?

31:42.170 --> 31:45.840
Don’t make me choose
between the two of you.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.210
Okay?

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
I heard what happened.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.250
How are things
with the judge?

31:59.250 --> 32:00.710
Trish still has me
in the doghouse.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.880
Wouldn’t let me leave
without carrying this.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.090
Pocket Penal Code.
You never know

32:05.090 --> 32:06.590
when that might
come in handy, Rog.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.250
You want it?
Mine’s signed.

32:08.250 --> 32:08.920
Yeah. Anyway,

32:08.920 --> 32:10.880
where are we with Rodney,
the lottery commissioner?

32:10.880 --> 32:12.750
He’s in the wind.
But according to his brother,

32:12.750 --> 32:15.630
he’s a gambler, in debt
big-time with the Armenians.

32:15.630 --> 32:16.920
And your human Frogger act
paid off.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.590
Tell him what you found
on the laptop.

32:18.590 --> 32:19.250
Well, before you caught Mateo,

32:19.250 --> 32:21.960
he hacked into Rodney’s
bank account and emptied it all.

32:21.960 --> 32:22.880
All seven million dollars.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.960
Okay, well, the Armenians
are gonna be after it.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.460
So, Bailey, we need to...

32:27.460 --> 32:28.630
Follow the money?

32:28.630 --> 32:30.880
We need to find the funds.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.550
You’re right.
That’s totally different.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.460
Totally different.
You might’ve coined something.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.630
Max, go grab your lunch
from the fridge.

32:41.630 --> 32:44.550
Your ride’ll
be here soon.
Okay.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.550
S-Sorry, we’re-we’re
not open yet.

33:00.550 --> 33:04.000
That’s okay.
We’re not here to eat.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.460
No.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.210
No, no.
Don’t be scared,
sweetheart.

33:07.210 --> 33:10.460
I hear you have
a guardian angel.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.750
Bridget Gerhart. The waitress
from the Frabble Shack. She said

33:13.750 --> 33:15.090
that Mateo ate
there all the time.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.170
Her husband’s the one
that Mateo killed.

33:17.170 --> 33:18.380
He called himself
a guardian angel.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.050
I wonder if he was
watching over her.

33:20.050 --> 33:20.800
BAILEY:
Someone just initiated a

33:20.800 --> 33:23.090
seven million dollar withdrawal
from Bridget’s account.

33:23.090 --> 33:25.130
The IP address matches
the Frabble Shack.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.420
They must’ve
found her.

33:26.420 --> 33:27.710
Did you call
the restaurant?

33:27.710 --> 33:28.710
The line’s dead.

33:28.710 --> 33:29.420
Bailey, call the bank.

33:29.420 --> 33:31.750
Tell ’em to put a hold
on the account.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.300
We need to stall.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.090
You’re stalling.

33:39.090 --> 33:39.710
Get it done.

33:39.710 --> 33:41.920
Mateo told me what he did
to your husband.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.590
You don’t want to make your kid
an orphan, do you?

33:46.880 --> 33:48.590
What was that?

33:49.880 --> 33:51.380
Go check.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.630
Max, run!

34:02.960 --> 34:07.170
I’ll go after the kid.
You find Bridget.
Okay.

34:25.090 --> 34:26.000
LAPD!

34:27.210 --> 34:27.840
Get down!

34:33.920 --> 34:36.000
You stay there.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.050
Hey, Fatty!

35:19.670 --> 35:21.630
You stabbed me.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.800
Don can never know.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.170
NATALIE:So you can have

35:38.170 --> 35:41.550
any breakfast you want and
you are picking a Frabble?

35:41.550 --> 35:45.210
Dad got one for me yesterday,
but I never got to have it.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.670
Yesterday was
a little crazy, huh?

35:47.670 --> 35:48.590
Yeah, kinda.

35:48.590 --> 35:52.920
He really has no idea
how to be a dad.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.550
That’s my fault.

36:05.550 --> 36:08.590
I should’ve taken things
slower with the two of you.

36:08.590 --> 36:10.750
No, Mom,
it’s a good thing.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.420
At least
now I know

36:12.420 --> 36:14.630
he wants to try.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.210
Aah!

36:30.300 --> 36:32.130
Hold on, kid!

36:34.250 --> 36:34.800
You okay?

36:34.800 --> 36:37.460
We’re gonna climb down now,
all right?

36:40.550 --> 36:42.800
We’re not climbing down.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.210
We have to find-find another way

36:44.210 --> 36:46.590
to get out of here, all right?

36:49.920 --> 36:52.840
NATALIE:
Oh, there’s something going on
in the Frabble Shack.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.460
Looks like it’s closed.
Move it, let’s go.

36:54.460 --> 36:57.630
I’m sorry, sweetie.
No Frabble today.

36:57.630 --> 36:58.130
That’s okay.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.880
Maybe Dad can take me
another time.

36:59.880 --> 37:04.090
Maya, I know he’s not like
other dads...

37:05.590 --> 37:07.460
...but he would do

37:07.460 --> 37:08.460
anything for you.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.090
I want you
to know that.

37:11.090 --> 37:12.130
It’s okay.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.920
I’m one of the good guys.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.170
I promise.

37:15.170 --> 37:18.550
There you go.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.460
I got you.

This looks so good.

You went all out, Avery.

Don’t tell anybody, but I

out of the motor
pool budget.

Look, I need your help.
Okay.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.510
Should I hit him
with a "Dad’s old" joke

37:54.510 --> 37:56.050
or hit him
with a bald joke?

Ooh, I feel like you got to go
with the old joke first.

37:57.890 --> 38:01.390
Old joke?
Uh, neither. There will be

38:01.390 --> 38:03.510
no roasting.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.800
And the rest is history,

38:15.800 --> 38:20.850
Hey, guys, can I, uh, get
a minute with the judge, please?

38:20.850 --> 38:24.140
Hey, uh, I appreciate
you coming, Don.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.300
Oh, your big day--

38:25.300 --> 38:26.050
I wouldn’t miss it.

38:26.050 --> 38:28.890
And this is not easy
for me to say,

38:28.890 --> 38:32.140
but I want to thank you

38:32.140 --> 38:32.510
for saving my life.

38:32.510 --> 38:35.300
You know, Dershowitz said
my forward was a little long,

38:35.300 --> 38:39.430
but thank God it was.
Yeah, right?

38:42.470 --> 38:44.720
I’m sorry about...

38:44.720 --> 38:46.680
how I spoke to you
the other day.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.640
For better or worse,
you’re the...

38:49.640 --> 38:51.140
one person on planet Earth

38:51.140 --> 38:53.470
that makes me feel
that insecure.

38:53.470 --> 38:55.430
Oh. So you think
you’ve cornered

38:55.430 --> 38:58.100
the world’s market
on insecurity?

38:58.100 --> 38:59.800
Come on. You, Don?

38:59.800 --> 39:02.050
You were a federal judge.

39:02.050 --> 39:06.050
I was a lot of things. I was
a judge, a husband, a father.

39:06.050 --> 39:09.550
But that all
falls away. You’ll see.

39:09.550 --> 39:13.010
When I was young...

39:13.010 --> 39:18.050
Patricia thought the sun
rose and set with me.

39:18.050 --> 39:21.140
:
She still does.

39:21.350 --> 39:22.510
You know, what’s funny,

39:22.510 --> 39:25.050
when you’re young,
you worry that your kids

39:25.050 --> 39:28.720
will wind up with someone
not good enough for them.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.720
But I tell you,
the real fear

39:31.720 --> 39:37.640
is that they’ll wind up
with someone better than you.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.140
You full-on dove
under the table.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.970
I did not dive.

41:23.970 --> 41:25.050
Crouched, maybe.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.140
I’ve seen crouches. You dove.

41:27.140 --> 41:28.140
Okay, fine, I dove.

41:28.140 --> 41:31.050
And even though
it was nothing,

41:31.050 --> 41:34.430
you got down there with me.

41:34.430 --> 41:36.390
Cole,

41:36.390 --> 41:40.100
I forgot how safe

41:40.100 --> 41:41.390
you made me feel.

41:41.390 --> 41:45.390
And I know that when Maya’s
around you, she feels that, too.

41:45.390 --> 41:47.050
MAYA:
You guys done talking

41:47.050 --> 41:47.470
about me yet?

41:47.470 --> 41:50.100
Uh, you were supposed
to wait in the car.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.220
Yeah, that’s her move.

41:52.220 --> 41:53.890
Maya reminded me

41:53.890 --> 41:56.180
that she was promised
a night at her dad’s.

41:56.180 --> 42:00.720

spent it in the ER, so...
