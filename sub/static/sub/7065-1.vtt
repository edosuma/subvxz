Clear.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.799
Low Boy, Low Boy, this is Black Cat.

04:38.825 --> 04:40.555
E.T.A. Romeo LZ, one-niner.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.825
We are hot. Copy.

04:47.160 --> 04:47.774
Come on.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.565
Get out there! Go, go!

04:51.915 --> 04:54.210
Come on!

04:57.463 --> 04:59.923
Get in.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.636
Cover, cover. On the roof.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.393
Go!

05:19.235 --> 05:20.515
This is Low Boy.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.220
Package is wrapped.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.629
Ladies and gentlemen.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.631
Three weeks ago...

05:41.716 --> 05:44.843
Russian and American special forces...

05:44.927 --> 05:47.846
apprehended the self-proclaimed leader of Kazakhstan...

05:47.930 --> 05:50.182
General Ivan Radek.

05:53.603 --> 05:58.690
The forces of Radek were directed towards the suppression of democracy.

05:58.775 --> 06:04.321
His nuclear arsenal could have brought the world into a new cold war.

06:04.405 --> 06:08.033
But thanks to the support of one of the world's greatest leaders...

06:08.117 --> 06:10.410
Radek is now in prison.

06:15.291 --> 06:19.836
Today, we are honouring this brave man.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.547
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend...

06:22.632 --> 06:26.426
the president of the United States of America.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.569
The dead remember our indifference.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.905
The dead remember our silence.

06:46.989 --> 06:50.700
I came here tonight to be congratulated.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.286
But today, when I visited the Red Cross camps...

06:53.371 --> 06:56.540
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees...

06:56.624 --> 06:59.751
fleeing from the horror of Kazakhstan...

06:59.836 --> 07:02.212
I realized I don't deserve to be congratulated.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.423
- None of us do.
- What's he doing?

07:04.507 --> 07:05.351
Let's speak the truth.

07:05.377 --> 07:06.450
That's not the speech.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.053
The truth is, we acted too late.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.765
Only when our own national security was threatened...

07:13.850 --> 07:16.560
did we act.

07:16.644 --> 07:20.939
Radek's regime murdered over 200,000 men, women and children...

07:21.023 --> 07:23.150
and we watched it on TV.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.943
We let it happen.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.155
People were being slaughtered for over a year...

07:28.239 --> 07:33.326
and we issued economic sanctions and
hid behind the rhetoric of diplomacy.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.662
How dare we?

07:35.746 --> 07:40.417
The dead remember, real peace is not just the absence of conflict.

07:40.501 --> 07:45.213
It's the presence of justice.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.967
And tonight I come to you with a pledge to change America's policy.

07:49.051 --> 07:54.097
Never again will I allow our political self-interest...

07:54.182 --> 07:57.309
to deter us from doing what we know to be morally right.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.854
Atrocity and terror are not political weapons.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.608
And to those who would use them:

08:04.692 --> 08:06.693
Your day is over.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.656
We will never negotiate.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.952
We will no longer tolerate, and we will no longer be afraid.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.082
It's your turn to be afraid.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.388
Good evening.

08:52.414 --> 08:54.140
Can I get you to open the briefcase?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.461
The Russian was a nice touch.

08:58.487 --> 08:59.349
Tell my mother.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.214
She wanted me to study French.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.123
You know what you committed us to, sir?

09:03.149 --> 09:05.443
Yeah, I know exactly what I committed us to.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.511
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Air Force One.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.347
Please present your equipment for inspection.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.307
W-We were just inspected at the gate.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.352
Sir, this plane carries the president
of the United States, although we—

09:22.436 --> 09:23.488
I understand.

09:23.514 --> 09:25.213
I'm terribly sorry.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.984
Please place your thumb on the ID pad.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.286
Access cleared.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.006
Hello there.

09:56.032 --> 09:58.622
I'm Melanie Mitchell, deputy press secretary.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.991
I'll be takin' you in from here.

10:00.017 --> 10:00.999
Oh, Miss Mitchell.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.059
It is so nice to finally meet you in person.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.770
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.773
So, if, uh, you boys are all clear?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.276
Now, you know the president's on a very tight schedule.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.446
So, this is how it works: During
the flight, two members of your crew...

10:14.530 --> 10:16.781
will be allowed outside the press area for filming.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.076
You'll get exactly ten minutes with the president, 20 with the crew.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.085
Listen, Gary, the president is ready to take Congress on.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.087
He's not gonna kiss their ass for each vote.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.466
Let 'em vote us down and stand on their record.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.527
Yeah, I'm with him now.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.868
I'll call you from the plane.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.640
What do they say about the speech?

10:38.666 --> 10:40.580
Your speech is leading the news.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.892
- They're already calling it the "Be Afraid" speech.
- Good.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.936
With all due respect, sir, next time you
want to make a major policy departure...

10:47.021 --> 10:51.566
you might want to discuss it with your
National Security Advisor first.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.843
- We did discuss it, Jack.

10:52.869 --> 10:56.262
- We discussed it in private, which is where I thought it would remain.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.776
Well, now it's public.

10:58.802 --> 11:00.809
Now it's policy.

11:00.868 --> 11:01.660
- Get behind it.

11:01.686 --> 11:04.854
- The allies are gonna be very upset
they weren't consulted about this.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.624
It might come back and bite us in the ass in November.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.211
It's the right thing to do, and you know it.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.757
There goes the neighbourhood.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.010
If you'd like, I think we have time for a quick tour.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.578
- It would be delightful.

11:20.604 --> 11:22.205
- Good. 
- Andrei, Boris.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.344
Just follow me.

11:23.370 --> 11:27.544
Ahead of this staff cabin is Secret Service, right here.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.178
Don't ever try to go past 'em without an escort.

11:30.204 --> 11:31.464
You will be very sorry.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.692
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.277
Thanks for the warning.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.613
And here we have our in-flight offices.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.801
Mr President!

12:01.804 --> 12:02.626
Over here!

12:02.652 --> 12:04.789
Over here, Mr President!

12:04.849 --> 12:09.185
A lot of the plane's features are classified,
but I can tell you that it's bullet-resistant...

12:09.270 --> 12:12.939
and that it's even protected against the pulse of a nuclear blast.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.401
I'm not sure that's very comforting.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.403
Up those stairs is the cockpit...

12:18.487 --> 12:23.158
along with the most advanced communications
centre on or above the face of the earth.

12:23.242 --> 12:27.162
We could run the whole country from
here, or even a war if we had to.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.206
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts right from up there.

12:30.291 --> 12:30.984
- Melanie? - Yes?

12:31.010 --> 12:32.233
- The president's arriving.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.297
They should all take their seats.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.111
Right away.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.798
I'll get out of here and let you all get some sleep.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.263
Mr President, welcome aboard, sir.

12:54.289 --> 12:55.632
Hey, Danny. How are ya?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.276
- Mr President.
- Mr President.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.195
Change in plan, Danny.

13:00.221 --> 13:02.138
Let's go to Barbados.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.420
- Anything you want.

13:03.446 --> 13:05.767
You're the president. 
- Boy, I wish.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.952
- Mr President.
- Mr Gibbs, where's my bunch?

13:08.037 --> 13:08.747
The ballet ran late.

13:08.773 --> 13:09.979
They'll be here in five minutes.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.463
Okay. Lewis, you tape the game?

13:11.489 --> 13:13.233
Oh, it was a real squeaker, sir.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.078
Lewis, don't brief me on it.

13:15.104 --> 13:17.654
I want to watch it, for Christ's sake.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.215
- We'll be under way in about 30 minutes, sir.
- Okay.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.109
Mr President- 
- Sir?

13:21.135 --> 13:23.159
Yeah, could you put the game on now, please?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.088
Yes, sir. - Yeah, Jack.

13:24.114 --> 13:26.454
The Iraqis have mobilized two armoured brigades towards—

13:26.514 --> 13:28.970
Just got it. Gimme 15 minutes.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.959
Get the guys together.

13:31.018 --> 13:31.885
Repel them, repel them.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.060
Make them relinquish the ball.

13:33.086 --> 13:34.195
Hear about Notre Dame, Jim?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.589
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Don't tell me the score.

13:36.615 --> 13:37.257
- Great game.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.000
- Mr President.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.760
- We need to strategize, smooth some things out politically.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.334
What was that?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.509
Oh, it's not so important.

13:42.535 --> 13:43.930
- It's damage control. Now, what if-

13:43.989 --> 13:45.338
- Gimme a minute alone, will ya?

13:45.364 --> 13:47.725
- What if a quote, high-ranking White House official—

13:47.785 --> 13:49.193
Just give me a few moments alone, please.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.895
A quote, high-ranking White House official...

13:50.955 --> 13:52.956
- unquote, were to qualify what you said last night, leak it to...
- Stop.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.612
Drop it. Drop it.

13:53.638 --> 13:54.387
Do your self a favour.

13:54.413 --> 13:55.233
The Washington Post?

13:55.292 --> 13:56.001
It's policy.

13:56.027 --> 13:58.862
Drop it, or find yourself another ride home. Yeah?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.140
Mr President, the Russian news crew's with us.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.281
I told them you'd give 'em a sound bite...

14:01.340 --> 14:02.625
about life in the White House.

14:02.651 --> 14:04.450
There is no life in the White House.

14:04.510 --> 14:09.097
- You said it. The president needs some time alone.
- Aha.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.199
Fourteen-thirteen Michigan!

14:11.225 --> 14:13.167
All right, Mr President.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.691
That wasn't you napping during the performance, was it, Tom?

14:19.775 --> 14:22.527
No, ma'am, it was very enjoyable.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.732
Come on, Alice. You can finish it on the plane.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.347
Let's not keep your father waiting.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.591
- Just try and smile, sweetheart, okay?

14:27.617 --> 14:28.892
- Quick picture, Alice? 
- Alice! Alice!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.216
One picture for me?

14:30.242 --> 14:32.437
Thank you very much, Alice.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.443
...up over the ball.

14:33.469 --> 14:35.315
Second and five at the Notre Dame 28.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.835
Hudson split wide, Muhammad the l-back. Gives
to Muhammad over the right side, number 25.

14:38.919 --> 14:42.297
He's hit hard by Ron Davis and—

14:43.966 --> 14:45.884
Shh. Daddy's asleep.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.473
How was the ballet?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.642
- It was great!
- Ow!
- Oh!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.353
- Brat. Are you trying to kill me?
- Dad-Daddy!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.207
- Was it really good?

14:58.233 --> 14:58.880
Did you enjoy it?

14:58.906 --> 14:59.526
Did you love it?

14:59.552 --> 15:00.198
- It was great!

15:00.232 --> 15:03.067
- Men in tights. Did you hear my speech?
- Yeah.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.653
- "Yeah"?
- You're gonna get yourself re-elected.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.697
That's what I keep tellin' them.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.913
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the aircraft commander.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.610
We'll be taking the runway in just a few moments.

15:16.636 --> 15:17.732
So, are you guys comfortable?

15:17.791 --> 15:20.919
- Yes, very.
- I brought you VIP press kits.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.922
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.915
...he's allowed to jam that receiver-

15:36.941 --> 15:38.044
- Pass interference.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.133
That's cheating!

15:39.159 --> 15:41.089
Only if they get caught.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.025
- Dad.
- Way of the world, kiddo.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.620
The ball's marked at the 37-yard line.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.222
Let's call it third and a long three.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.992
Why didn't you take me with you when
you went to the refugee camp today?

15:55.621 --> 15:58.831
Well, for one thing, it's not 100% secure.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.163
You got your whole life to live, baby.

16:04.189 --> 16:06.823
You don't need to see that kind of stuff.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.134
Come on, Dad. It's not like I don't see it on the news.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.599
It's different on the news.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.413
All I'm saying is, I'm ready.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.099
You know, for things you don't think I'm ready for.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.677
Maybe I'm not ready.

16:17.703 --> 16:19.794
I'm 12 years old, Dad.

16:19.853 --> 16:24.315
In the caveman days, I'd be having children of my own.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.568
That's what we call progress, young lady.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.761
You're missing the best part of the game.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.072
God.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.868
Well, we're so looking forward to seeing you.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.359
- I just can't tell you—

16:37.385 --> 16:39.147
She is so anxious to grow up.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.631
Oh, I know, she's—

16:40.666 --> 16:43.122
Yes. The both of us.

16:43.148 --> 16:45.111
Okay. Bye-bye.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.216
Well, she couldn't stay your little girl forever, Jim.

16:50.300 --> 16:56.180
Well, I was hoping it would last till she was 14 or 15 or 50.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.144
They hated your speech, didn't they?

17:01.228 --> 17:03.688
They're afraid we won't have the guts to back it up...

17:03.772 --> 17:06.858
and that if we do, it'll be political suicide.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.153
Remember our first campaign?

17:09.179 --> 17:10.678
In the House?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.232
Yeah. 
- Yeah.

17:11.258 --> 17:12.888
Downstate, driving around with, uh...

17:12.948 --> 17:14.056
Who's that kid, our volunteer?

17:14.082 --> 17:15.558
That— Remember, with the- 
- Henry.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.577
- Henry, with the convertible...
- Yeah.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.163
- With the broken top, and the—
- Snow comin' in.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.415
Yeah, and we were the only three
people who thought you could win that.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.893
You didn't give a damn.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.944
You knew what needed to be done, and you did it.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.705
And you spoke from your heart.

17:29.731 --> 17:31.657
And that's what I heard tonight.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.346
Well, it felt good.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.849
Yeah, I'll bet it did.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.939
Sir—

17:47.024 --> 17:48.377
Sorry to interrupt.

17:48.403 --> 17:50.468
Everybody's assembled, sir.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.784
United States Air Force One.

17:57.868 --> 18:02.413
It is an honour to clear you for immediate take-off on runway two-five.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.115
Air Force One clear for take-off.

18:04.141 --> 18:06.150
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.849
In Moscow tonight, President Marshall defended...

19:02.933 --> 19:05.434
the joint military action against the Radek regime...

19:05.519 --> 19:08.813
an act the administration had been calling a one-time intervention.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.524
But, in a rare display of emotion, the president alluded...

19:11.608 --> 19:14.694
to a major change in U.S. Foreign policy, when he stated...

19:14.778 --> 19:18.281
that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist government.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.326
Meanwhile, in Kazakhstan, Radek's ouster
has stalled the neocommunist revolution.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.204
These are two of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard brigades...

19:25.289 --> 19:26.642
- that have been moved north.

19:26.668 --> 19:27.926
- He knows we're watching.

19:27.952 --> 19:29.258
He knows we'll retaliate.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.669
Why the hell is he sending tanks to the border?

19:31.753 --> 19:34.463
Could be a response to your speech, Mr President.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.591
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law out there.
- Very funny.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.540
Think there's one or two he hasn't shot yet.

19:39.566 --> 19:41.412
What does State have to say?

19:41.471 --> 19:44.682
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.665
Let's not waste any more time.

19:46.691 --> 19:48.336
Send the Nimitz back in.

19:48.395 --> 19:52.648
...we're leaving Berlin's airspace, and—
...and Roger-

19:52.733 --> 19:54.650
- Gibbs.
- Guys.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.871
- Sleepin' on the job?
- No, sir.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.888
Hey, guys. 
These are the advance team reports...

20:23.972 --> 20:26.849
from the, uh,
Miami field agent.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.851
- Take a look at 'em.
- Thank you.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.029
Smoke. There's smoke!

21:27.869 --> 21:30.496
Steward!
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin!

21:30.580 --> 21:33.145
Everybody move to the back of the plane.

21:33.171 --> 21:33.983
Now! Please!

21:34.042 --> 21:35.286
Smoke! Smoke!

21:35.312 --> 21:37.320
Notify the cockpit!

21:46.680 --> 21:49.307
Come on! Come on!

21:49.391 --> 21:52.018
Mr President, stay back.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.898
Get down! Everybody down!

22:06.950 --> 22:08.499
- Oh, my God!
- Code Red!

22:08.525 --> 22:10.165
We have a Code Red, Jeremy!

22:10.191 --> 22:11.587
Shots fired on board.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.930
Flight deck Code Red acknowledged.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.148
Bridges, lock that door, now.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.834
- Yes, sir.
- Flight control, this is Air Force One declaring emergency.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.573
Get down! Get down!

22:18.599 --> 22:19.618
Cover up!

22:19.644 --> 22:20.888
Stay back!

22:24.593 --> 22:26.719
Move up!
I'll cover ya!

22:26.803 --> 22:29.513
Go! Go, go!

22:29.598 --> 22:30.916
What's goin' on? 
- Shots fired, sir!

22:30.942 --> 22:32.333
My family! 
What about my family?

22:32.392 --> 22:33.937
- We're handling it, sir.

22:33.963 --> 22:36.010
- Boy Scout's comin' out! 
Cover!

22:36.036 --> 22:37.571
Cover! Give him cover!

22:37.606 --> 22:39.815
- Daddy?
- Alice, get back!

22:39.900 --> 22:43.903
- Daddy!
- Alice? Alice, get down!

22:43.987 --> 22:44.665
Around here!

22:44.691 --> 22:46.555
Take him around here!
Get down!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.510
Ramstein Tower, this is Air Force One.

22:48.536 --> 22:49.433
We are Code Red.

22:49.493 --> 22:54.205
Shots fired on board. Request emergency
assistance. E.T. A: 15 minutes.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.227
Air Force One, acknowledged.

22:55.253 --> 22:56.357
We are scrambling our fighters.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.334
Emergency equipment will be standing by.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.289
Get him to the escape pod.

23:11.315 --> 23:13.916
Boy Scout is headed to the vault.

23:13.975 --> 23:17.353
- The football! The football!
- There it is.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.463
Get around here!

23:21.489 --> 23:24.343
Get him down to the pod!

23:25.821 --> 23:27.738
- Don't move!
- Everybody, head down!

23:27.823 --> 23:29.782
Get the president!

23:32.411 --> 23:33.263
Move! They're on us!

23:33.289 --> 23:34.311
Where's my family?

23:34.371 --> 23:35.623
Get in the pod, sir. Get in!

23:35.649 --> 23:36.856
What about my family?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.691
Air Force One, landing runway 09.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.284
I repeat, runway 09.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.187
Roger. Turning to heading 185.

23:50.213 --> 23:51.871
Descending to 5,000 feet.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.532
Hurry, he's in the escape pod.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.596
Ramstein.
This is Air Force One.

24:25.622 --> 24:27.490
Emergency pod has been deployed.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.593
I repeat.
The emergency pod has been deployed.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.821
Ramstein Tower, acknowledge.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.747
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.940
Are the scenario options ready to look at?

24:42.966 --> 24:43.923
Just about, sir.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.025
- Has General Northwood arrived?
- Yes, he has.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.526
Give me an update.

24:49.552 --> 24:51.034
Madam Vice-President, this way.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.206
We'll avoid the press.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.315
Is the president secure?

24:53.341 --> 24:55.893
Not yet. The recovery team will have him very soon.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.915
Air Force One, this is Halo Flight Lead.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.202
You are now under escort.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.801
All airspace has been cleared.

25:14.827 --> 25:16.622
Alert forces have been mobilized.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.456
Is everyone here?

25:17.482 --> 25:18.666
We're workin' on it.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.866
How the hell did this happen?

25:19.892 --> 25:21.544
How the hell did they get Air Force One?

25:21.603 --> 25:24.021
Gentlemen. Mr Secretary.

25:26.149 --> 25:30.361
Ramstein Tower, we are at ten miles
northwest to final, coming in red hot.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.670
Roger, Air Force One, wind is zero-niner-zero at one-two.

25:33.696 --> 25:34.974
You are clear to land.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.833
They're landing.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.417
- Hey, what are you guys-

25:47.443 --> 25:48.320
- Get down now!

25:54.177 --> 25:58.639
Open the door!
Open the door!

26:08.024 --> 26:10.859
Open! Open the door!

26:10.944 --> 26:12.962
No matter what happens, we land this aircraft.

26:12.988 --> 26:13.846
Is that understood?

26:16.199 --> 26:18.951
Come on, come on.
Flaps, 30.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.453
Flaps, 30.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.880
If we land, we're finished.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.903
- No!
- Get the fuck in the air!

26:59.075 --> 27:01.160
Now! Take this plane up!

27:03.163 --> 27:05.247
Up! Up!

27:07.083 --> 27:09.168
- Get us back in the air now!
- Artie!

27:11.046 --> 27:13.172
- Take it up!
- Artie—

27:13.256 --> 27:16.175
Get this plane back in the air now,
or you die!

27:17.886 --> 27:20.054
- Get up now!
- No!

27:35.362 --> 27:38.405
Get him!

27:49.209 --> 27:51.752
No! Jesus!

28:11.606 --> 28:14.024
Come on, come on!

28:14.109 --> 28:16.735
Come on!

28:54.858 --> 28:57.025
Air Force One, this is Ramstein Tower.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.194
- Contact those F-15s.
- Sir.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.239
I want them to keep Air Force One in visual contact at all times.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.677
What are our airborne scenarios?

29:03.703 --> 29:05.309
There are no airborne scenarios.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.394
Well, we'd better start generating them, hadn't we, General?

29:07.420 --> 29:09.146
And they better be damn good, and they better work.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.081
How long can they stay up there with the fuel they have?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.792
- That's a question of air speed. Wind.
- Altitude.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.383
We need an Air Force One pilot in here.

29:15.409 --> 29:17.571
Any educated guesses as to where they might be going?

29:17.630 --> 29:19.390
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria—
- Those are guesses.

29:19.416 --> 29:20.783
I don't know if they're educated.

29:20.842 --> 29:21.994
So we better notify our allies.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.040
We'll need secure airspace.

29:23.066 --> 29:24.311
Could we keep that under wraps?

29:24.345 --> 29:25.373
- We'll do our best.

29:25.399 --> 29:27.731
- If you could just try and relax, Kathryn.

29:27.757 --> 29:28.816
I'm in charge here.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.942
Well, I don't know, Walter.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.585
It seems to me that they're in charge.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.877
- Air Force One, this is Ramstein Tower.
Please respond.

29:39.903 --> 29:40.969
- We're heading home.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.033
- Air Force One, this is Ramstein Tower.
- Let's get him.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.619
State your intention.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.621
- Don't hurt me!
- Go.
- Yes, I will.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.623
- Here.
- Go.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.253
The president.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.923
The president is no longer on board.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.966
He made it to the pod and escaped.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.968
Keep moving!

30:19.400 --> 30:23.111
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered—

30:23.196 --> 30:26.323
the same crew that was cleared to fly on Air Force One.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.909
- Jesus.
- Oh, please tell me it's not that easy.

30:28.993 --> 30:32.329
No. You would have to generate fake ID, photo, fingerprints-

30:32.413 --> 30:33.929
- Could be with a little help from Moscow.

30:33.955 --> 30:35.858
- How would they get the weapons on board the plane?

30:35.917 --> 30:38.053
There's no way to get weapons aboard Air Force One.

30:38.079 --> 30:38.735
It's impossible.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.119
Well, there are enough weapons
already on board to take Panama.

30:41.145 --> 30:42.197
But who has access to them?

30:42.257 --> 30:44.306
- You think someone on the plane helped them?

30:44.332 --> 30:46.869
- What if somebody did, and they're still on the plane?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.729
Who do they trust up there?

30:48.755 --> 30:49.955
Who do we trust?

30:52.183 --> 30:55.185
Madam Vice-President?
Mr Secretary.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.928
All compromised nuclear launch codes have been cancelled.

30:58.954 --> 31:00.340
New codes are active.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.027
Ramstein, the president's escape pod has been located.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.530
We're homing in at 285 degrees.

31:11.786 --> 31:12.662
There it is.

31:12.688 --> 31:15.314
Ramstein, we have a strong signal.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.624
E.T. A: Two minutes.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.297
Oh, my God!

31:26.426 --> 31:28.969
Where is the wife and daughter?

31:30.597 --> 31:32.402
Just wait. 
- I want to talk to him.

31:32.428 --> 31:33.665
Wait, wait, wait.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.976
No, let me go.

31:36.060 --> 31:40.105
Let me see him.
Let me—

31:41.566 --> 31:43.483
Where is my husband?

31:45.945 --> 31:46.999
He has fled.

31:47.025 --> 31:50.098
The coward chose to save himself.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.075
- Yes!
- Yes!

31:52.160 --> 31:56.705
But one can always strike a bargain.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.666
No, you listen to me.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.337
I don't know who you are or what you want...

32:03.421 --> 32:06.381
but you will never get it.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.134
He will not negotiate.

32:10.845 --> 32:16.183
Really?
His wife. His daughter.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.520
A man could not live with himself.

32:20.605 --> 32:24.816
And it would be such bad politics.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.201
- I think he will negotiate.
- Oh, my God.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.589
Escape pod is visually acquired.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.926
Location off Ramstein is 284 degrees...

32:51.010 --> 32:52.970
12 miles out.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.025
All the weapons have been collected.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.694
Nevsky, check the plane again.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.696
You have the first watch.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.755
I'll check downstairs.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.185
Ready.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.163
It's Air Force One.

34:51.188 --> 34:53.197
They want to talk to the vice-president.

35:05.269 --> 35:09.022
Hello, can you hear me?

35:09.107 --> 35:12.938
This is the vice-president of the United States.

35:12.964 --> 35:14.761
To whom am I speaking?

35:14.821 --> 35:18.740
This is the person who controls Air Force One...

35:18.825 --> 35:21.535
the world's most secure aircraft.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.164
What is it that you want?

35:26.249 --> 35:29.709
We'll get to that.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.547
- I would like to speak to the First Lady.
- No.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.675
- No. Why?
- I need to know that they're safe.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.646
The president is safe.

35:38.672 --> 35:41.329
But then, you must know that.

35:41.389 --> 35:45.225
He ran from here like a whipped dog.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.645
I'm sure you can't wait for him to
get back to making the decisions...

35:48.729 --> 35:53.358
so you can stop sweating through that silk blouse of yours.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.365
What is the condition of the people on board?

36:00.449 --> 36:04.077
- Some are dead.
- Jesus.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.769
What are your intentions?

36:05.795 --> 36:07.272
What arrogance...

36:07.331 --> 36:10.750
to think you could ever understand my intentions.

36:10.835 --> 36:14.254
I want to understand what it is that you want.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.340
What do I want?

36:17.425 --> 36:23.180
When Mother Russia becomes one great nation again...

36:23.264 --> 36:26.641
when the capitalists are dragged from the Kremlin...

36:26.726 --> 36:29.686
and shot in the street...

36:29.770 --> 36:33.773
when our enemies run and hide in fear...

36:33.858 --> 36:35.775
at the mention of our name...

36:35.860 --> 36:40.447
and America begs our forgiveness—

36:40.531 --> 36:44.993
on that great day of deliverance...

36:45.077 --> 36:47.454
you will know what I want.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.625
We can give you a forum for your grievances.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.960
We can contact the Russian government.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.838
But you must understand that it will take some time.

36:56.923 --> 36:57.807
Oh, really?

36:57.833 --> 37:01.368
Well, when you talk to the president, you might remind him...

37:01.427 --> 37:05.472
that I am holding his wife, his daughter, his Chief of Staff...

37:05.556 --> 37:08.725
his National Security Advisor, his classified papers...

37:08.809 --> 37:11.895
and his baseball glove!

37:11.979 --> 37:17.150
If he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow...

37:17.235 --> 37:20.487
to release General Radek.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.322
Fifty for one.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.341
It's a good deal.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.643
How's your blouse?

37:29.455 --> 37:32.832
What assurances do I have that you'll keep your word?

37:32.917 --> 37:37.379
I'll wait for confirmation that General Radek has been released.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.507
Until then...

37:41.842 --> 37:45.011
I will execute a hostage every half an hour.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.392
You have my word.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.604
You must understand that we—

37:54.689 --> 37:56.982
- Hello?
- They're off!
- Hello?

37:59.443 --> 38:01.903
- Dave's the language expert.
- Damn it.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.698
Nobody does this to the United States.

38:04.782 --> 38:08.410
The president will get back his baseball
glove and play catch with this guy's balls.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.308
We can't do anything in half an hour.

38:10.334 --> 38:11.313
We need more time.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.130
He's a zealot. Tough to negotiate with.

38:13.156 --> 38:14.733
All you can do is wear them down.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.752
Mr Secretary!
Mr Secretary, sir.

38:24.885 --> 38:28.763
We found the escape pod.
It's empty.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.061
So where's the president?

38:38.649 --> 38:41.860
I think we have to acknowledge the possibility...

38:41.944 --> 38:44.237
that the president...

38:44.322 --> 38:46.281
may be dead.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.995
Why wouldn't they tell us?

38:52.079 --> 38:55.915
Diversion, trying to buy some time.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.752
Could have happened at a crossfire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate.

38:58.836 --> 38:59.908
Damn right we'll retaliate.

38:59.934 --> 39:02.197
We'll release General Radek into the goddam atmosphere.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.146
It doesn't add up.

39:03.172 --> 39:06.284
That terrorist knew that we'd recover the pod in short order.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.595
He expected that we'd be talking to Marshall.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.943
Let's not bury him yet.

39:09.969 --> 39:12.165
He could still be alive in that plane.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.809
Let's not forget, this president is a Medal of Honour winner.

39:14.894 --> 39:18.772
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter rescue
missions than any other man in my command.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.165
- He knows how to fight.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.134
- Then he's taking a terrible chance with his life.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.988
The element of surprise is a formidable advantage in combat.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.949
If he's up there, he's the best chance that we have.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.619
That pod was designed for a reason, General.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.580
He has no right to take chances with his life.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.658
Everything is all right.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.041
What does the psych profile say?

41:41.067 --> 41:42.440
How far do they say he'll go?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.745
He's a Radek loyalist.

41:43.771 --> 41:46.486
That tells us all we need to know, doesn't it?

41:46.545 --> 41:48.752
He'll see this thing through to the last hostage.

41:48.778 --> 41:49.572
Or his own death.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.467
You release this bastard and all of Central Asia will go up in flames.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.113
- I'm well aware of that, Walter.

41:54.139 --> 41:57.121
- Bring back the old Soviet Empire under a flag of genocide?

41:57.181 --> 42:00.475
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

42:00.559 --> 42:05.355
I hate to say this, but 50 people is a small
price to pay to stop that from happening.

42:05.439 --> 42:07.145
Even if one of them is the president?

42:07.171 --> 42:09.384
The presidency is bigger than any one man.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.123
- Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

42:11.149 --> 42:14.055
- Can't we release him today and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

42:14.114 --> 42:15.893
- We caught him before, we catch him again.

42:15.919 --> 42:18.142
- If Petrov releases Radek, his government will fall.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.390
I promise you that.

42:19.416 --> 42:21.729
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

42:21.789 --> 42:24.958
You go to catch him again, you're gonna find him in Moscow.

42:25.042 --> 42:29.003
With all respect, Mr Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics. We need options.

42:29.088 --> 42:29.925
It's not an option.

42:29.951 --> 42:31.027
We need a decision.

42:31.053 --> 42:32.198
- It's not her decision.

42:32.258 --> 42:32.908
- Oh?

42:32.934 --> 42:34.235
- This is a military situation.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.560
I'm the Secretary of Defence.

42:35.594 --> 42:36.449
Check your regs.

42:36.475 --> 42:39.414
In the absence of the president, the buck stops here.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.516
Get the Attorney General with a copy of the Constitution.

42:41.600 --> 42:46.479
We have— oh, my God—
19 minutes.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.023
I'm gonna consult with President Petrov.

42:59.493 --> 43:03.371
...37-yard line.
Let's call it third and a long three.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.178
It's gonna be a double tight end set.

43:05.204 --> 43:06.274
Alexander and Brooks.

43:06.333 --> 43:09.460
Malcolm is split wide again right behind the tailback.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.945
Madam Vice-President, I'm sorry.

47:07.971 --> 47:09.225
I cannot release him.

47:09.284 --> 47:12.703
We would train all our military might against this one target.

47:12.788 --> 47:14.997
I assure you, though, he wouldn't stay at large for long.

47:15.082 --> 47:18.362
Maybe so, but millions of lives are hanging in the balance.

47:18.388 --> 47:20.027
I am trying to save a nation!

47:20.087 --> 47:21.171
As am I.

47:21.197 --> 47:25.533
No nation can easily survive the loss of nor soon replace a great leader.

47:25.592 --> 47:29.762
Now, let us be pragmatic. 50 lives means nothing in the grand scheme.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.848
Well, then, let me be equally pragmatic.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.517
Our president took a great risk to come to your aid...

47:34.601 --> 47:37.395
against strong opposition in both parties and among our allies.

47:37.479 --> 47:39.730
It would be politically impossible to do so again.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.900
If it meant saving his life, I would gladly do it.

47:42.985 --> 47:46.445
But I would have to know for sure, and you cannot tell me he's alive.

47:46.530 --> 47:50.283
- Can you?
- No, Mr President, I cannot.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.689
Then there is nothing I can do.

47:52.715 --> 47:54.812
I am truly sorry. Goodbye.

47:58.208 --> 47:58.761
Okay, Walter.

47:58.787 --> 48:00.318
You and your generals get to work.

48:21.023 --> 48:24.317
He was in Afghanistan with me for five years.

48:26.236 --> 48:29.155
Find out who killed him or you lie down next to him.

48:46.381 --> 48:50.134
Okay. They can't keep the plane in the air indefinitely.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.553
There are only four possible landing sites in Kazakhstan...

48:52.638 --> 48:56.390
that are still controlled by Radek's forces;
we have to go in and take all of them.

48:56.475 --> 48:57.198
Can we do it?

48:57.224 --> 48:59.669
I'd rather take my chances in the air.

48:59.728 --> 49:02.134
No, I just looked at the airborne scenarios.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.042
They're no good.

49:03.068 --> 49:03.948
Can we do this?

49:03.982 --> 49:06.317
In the time we have? Messy.

49:06.401 --> 49:08.986
Three more minutes before they execute the first hostage.

49:09.071 --> 49:12.531
- You have to buy us some more time.
- All right.

49:18.538 --> 49:20.039
It's time.

49:21.083 --> 49:24.418
Transfer the phone to the conference room.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.154
You, both. Come here.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.573
No. No.

49:56.326 --> 49:58.661
Now!

50:13.051 --> 50:15.052
They will transfer the call here.

50:17.264 --> 50:21.017
So, let's just wait.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.192
Excuse me.

50:31.611 --> 50:32.724
Sir, if you will permit me.

50:32.750 --> 50:35.056
I am the National Security Advisor at the White House.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.283
I'm the man the president would be listening to.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.286
I believe that you are negotiating right now with the vice-president?

50:40.370 --> 50:44.040
Unfortunately, in our system of government,
the vice-president is like the Queen of England.

50:44.124 --> 50:47.752
She can't even get airline tickets without talking to somebody like me.

50:47.836 --> 50:52.048
Therefore, let me speak to the White House, because I promise you...

50:52.132 --> 50:54.633
I'm the one person who can make this all work out.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.933
Has he been released?

51:03.018 --> 51:05.154
I've contacted the Russian government.

51:05.180 --> 51:06.921
We've set things in motion...

51:06.980 --> 51:09.273
but at this point we have to be realistic.

51:09.357 --> 51:12.026
It's going to take more time.

51:12.110 --> 51:14.153
More time?

51:19.785 --> 51:24.038
Your National Security Advisor has just been executed.

51:24.122 --> 51:26.624
He's a very good negotiator.

51:26.708 --> 51:29.251
He bought you another half hour.

51:39.638 --> 51:44.058
Mrs Marshall, Alice...

51:44.142 --> 51:47.186
if you please, come with me.

52:25.433 --> 52:28.185
It's the first time you ever seen a man killed, huh?

52:28.270 --> 52:30.229
Leave her alone.

52:31.898 --> 52:36.777
You think I am a monster that I would kill this man?

52:36.862 --> 52:40.364
Somebody's son?

52:40.448 --> 52:42.741
Somebody's father?

52:44.286 --> 52:47.788
I am somebody's son too.

52:47.873 --> 52:50.541
I have three small children.

52:51.877 --> 52:55.129
Does that surprise you?

52:58.091 --> 52:58.971
Tell her to answer.

52:58.997 --> 53:00.201
You leave her alone.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.469
Shut up!

53:06.892 --> 53:09.685
Why did you kill him?

53:09.769 --> 53:13.314
Because I believe.

53:13.398 --> 53:17.693
When I shoot this man I know in that instant...

53:17.777 --> 53:20.863
how deep was my belief...

53:20.947 --> 53:25.576
that I would turn my back on God himself...

53:25.660 --> 53:29.038
for Mother Russia.

53:29.122 --> 53:33.584
My doubts, my fears, my own private morality-

53:35.921 --> 53:40.007
it dissolve in this moment...

53:40.091 --> 53:42.468
for this love.

53:44.596 --> 53:48.265
You know, your father he has also killed.

53:48.350 --> 53:51.560
- Is he a bad man?
- That's not true.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.562
Why?

53:53.647 --> 53:58.943
Because he does it in a tuxedo with
a telephone call and a smart bomb?

54:00.487 --> 54:03.072
You are a monster.

54:03.156 --> 54:06.617
And my father is a great man.

54:06.701 --> 54:09.370
You're nothing like my father.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.650
What's the goddam number?

54:45.031 --> 54:45.963
What city, please?

54:45.989 --> 54:47.434
Washington, D.C., please.

54:47.460 --> 54:48.500
The White House.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.081
Just a moment. Here's the number.

54:50.107 --> 54:51.979
Can you connect me to that number?

54:52.038 --> 54:54.707
- There's a connect fee of one dollar, sir.
- Fine.

55:09.597 --> 55:11.108
White House switchboard.

55:11.134 --> 55:12.958
How may I direct your call?

55:13.018 --> 55:15.519
All right, listen.
Listen carefully.

55:15.603 --> 55:17.772
This is an emergency call from Air Force One.

55:17.798 --> 55:18.881
This is the president.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.025
Connect me to the vice-president, please.

55:21.109 --> 55:23.902
Who did you say is calling?

55:25.780 --> 55:28.157
- This is the president.
- Yeah, right.

55:28.241 --> 55:29.242
And I'm the first lady.

55:29.268 --> 55:30.100
Don't cut me off.

55:30.126 --> 55:31.251
This is an emergency.

55:31.286 --> 55:34.419
Sir, the president doesn't call this particular phone number.

55:34.445 --> 55:35.606
So, whoever you are...

55:35.665 --> 55:37.875
- Trace the call.
- Get a life.

55:37.959 --> 55:42.046
Follow your standard security procedure...

55:42.130 --> 55:44.381
and trace the goddam call.

55:44.466 --> 55:45.283
Okay, sir.

55:45.309 --> 55:48.577
You wanna make a federal case out of this, fine by me.

55:56.936 --> 55:59.621
Look- Anyone there?

55:59.647 --> 56:02.049
Don't move!

56:02.108 --> 56:03.429
I traced the call, sir.

56:03.455 --> 56:04.718
Give me the gun.

56:04.778 --> 56:07.488
- Are you there?
- Very slowly.

56:07.572 --> 56:08.396
Oh, my God.

56:08.422 --> 56:11.642
I'll put you right through, Mr President.

56:15.580 --> 56:17.581
Good. Go.

56:17.665 --> 56:20.584
The switchboard has a call from someone claiming to be the president.

56:20.668 --> 56:23.212
She traced it back to the White House satellite account.

56:23.296 --> 56:26.033
The caller's gone but the line is still active.

56:26.059 --> 56:27.199
Put it through.

56:28.426 --> 56:31.845
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.215
You know who I am.

56:33.241 --> 56:36.166
I'm the president of the United States.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.185
Yes!

56:38.269 --> 56:40.229
Don't think that means I don't shoot you.

56:40.313 --> 56:42.940
Put your hands behind your head and move.

56:52.033 --> 56:53.277
This is your lucky day.

56:53.303 --> 56:54.953
What more could my people do?

56:54.979 --> 56:56.979
Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

56:57.038 --> 56:59.748
Even if they tried, we're equipped with tactical countermeasures.

56:59.833 --> 57:00.471
He's talking to us.

57:00.497 --> 57:01.397
What are you telling me?

57:01.423 --> 57:02.134
What do you mean?

57:02.168 --> 57:03.447
I just want you to feel secure.

57:03.473 --> 57:04.750
That way no one will get hurt.

57:04.776 --> 57:06.138
The computer'll fly circles...

57:06.172 --> 57:09.758
around any missile they fire at us,
and they'll hit just a shock wave.

57:09.843 --> 57:12.386
- He's telling us what to do.
- Believe me...

57:12.470 --> 57:15.305
all that'd happen is we'd get knocked off our feet, that's all!

57:15.390 --> 57:17.391
Shut up, goddam it!

57:17.475 --> 57:20.811
My God. Is he saying what I think he's saying?

57:20.895 --> 57:23.147
- If we're going to act we have to act now.
- It's too risky.

57:23.231 --> 57:25.315
The president is up there with a gun to his head.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.026
He's asking us to do that to Air Force One?

57:28.111 --> 57:29.303
He's not asking.

57:29.329 --> 57:33.724
Your commander in chief has issued a direct order. Do it!

57:38.455 --> 57:40.956
Sir, are you sure that's what you want me to do?

57:41.040 --> 57:42.184
You heard me, Carlton.

57:42.210 --> 57:44.860
And let's pray it works the way it's supposed to.

57:44.919 --> 57:46.780
Okay, boys, give me some room.

57:46.806 --> 57:49.907
I've just been ordered to fire on Air Force One.

58:03.104 --> 58:06.398
I'm in position.
Missiles are armed.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.400
All right.

58:10.111 --> 58:11.418
Target is acquired.

58:11.444 --> 58:12.888
I have a good lock.

58:14.365 --> 58:16.533
God, I hope this works.

58:16.618 --> 58:18.619
Fox three!

58:40.433 --> 58:42.434
What's going on?

58:43.394 --> 58:45.091
The Americans fired at us.

58:45.117 --> 58:46.421
I have no control.

58:47.482 --> 58:49.441
The computer is flying.

59:07.252 --> 59:10.128
- Mom!
- Are they crazy?

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:17.279
This is Marshall.
Anyone there?

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.617
We're here, Mr President.

01:00:18.643 --> 01:00:20.599
Where's my family? 
Are they safe?

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:22.579
Well, the terrorists claim they're holding them.

01:00:22.605 --> 01:00:23.310
We can't confirm.

01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:24.519
Who are they?

01:00:24.545 --> 01:00:26.313
What do they want?

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:28.498
They're Russian ultranationalist radicals.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:33.128
- They want General Radek released from prison.
- Radek?

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:34.328
What are our tactical options?

01:00:34.354 --> 01:00:35.989
We're working on that, Mr President...

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.508
but the bastards do have us in a corner.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:39.774
There is no rescue attempt?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.286
I ruled out a midair rescue.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.519
There's nothing we can do while the plane is still in the air.

01:00:43.545 --> 01:00:45.165
Then we gotta get this plane on the ground.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.643
Take me off the goddam speakerphone.

01:00:47.669 --> 01:00:48.877
Where's Bennett?

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:52.522
- Mr President.
- We cannot release Radek.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:55.567
They're gonna shoot a hostage every half hour until we do.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.779
I don't want a plane full of dead people.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:03.033
Jim, they shot Jack Doherty.

01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:05.535
Oh, Christ.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.885
Kathryn, we can't give in to their demands.

01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:08.939
It won't end there.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.500
And if you die on that plane, does it end there?

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:15.128
Kathryn, we've got a job to do, whatever the cost.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.130
- Mr President, l—
- Kathryn...

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:21.301
if you give a mouse a cookie—

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:27.015
He's gonna want a glass of milk.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.268
We've gotta get this plane on the ground.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.322
- Has Bazylev returned?
- No.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:32.456
Get the plane on the ground.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.771
This man down there evades us.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.690
My patience is running out.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.541
I thought I'd ask you to come and join us.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:01.253
It's starting to feel a little empty up here.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.631
Sit down, please.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.348
Come.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.866
Tell me your name again...

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.368
for the record.

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:39.040
Melanie.
Melanie Mitchell.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:44.087
You travel often with the president.

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:49.134
- Yes.
- So you, you know everyone on the plane.

01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:53.179
Yes.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:57.225
I bet they like you, huh?

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:00.228
You're a nice person, yes?

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:06.568
Okay. I guess so.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.464
You are trembling.

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:30.300
Why are you afraid?

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:35.305
Because I don't wanna die.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:38.224
I don't wanna die.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:44.105
Tell me, what am I doing at this moment?

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:47.984
You're pointing a gun at me.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.612
Thank you, Melanie.

01:05:50.696 --> 01:05:54.366
This is to the Secret Service agent in the baggage deck.

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.744
I will count to ten.

01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:01.748
And if you do not surrender, this nice woman will die.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.627
- No.
- One.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.479
No, please, don't. - Two.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:08.989
Don't do this.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.035
No! - Three.

01:06:10.061 --> 01:06:12.200
Let me talk to him.

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:14.844
- Four.
- I beg you, please.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.472
- Five.
- Let me talk to the agent!

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:20.600
- Six.
- He might listen to me!

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.520
- Seven.
- Please, I beg you. Don't do this.

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:25.939
- Eight.
- Don't do this, please!

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:28.191
- Nine.
- No!

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.706
God.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:52.382
Let's just think about that one for a moment...

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:55.510
and then we'll start again.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:07:00.724
Next time, I'll choose someone more important.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:24.080
I know what you are thinking, First Lady.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:26.374
You want me dead.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.561
Well, it may come to that.

01:07:28.587 --> 01:07:30.445
In a war, people die.

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:33.089
This isn't war.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.884
You just murdered an unarmed woman!

01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:40.346
You, who murdered 100,000 Iraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas...

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.892
are going to lecture me about the rules of war?

01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:47.604
Don't!

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:50.057
Mr President. How can I help you?

01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:53.384
Chief, you could help me dump some fuel.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.087
Who's down there on the baggage deck?

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.555
The Russian said it was a Secret Service agent. 
Who?

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.288
We have no idea, sir.

01:07:58.314 --> 01:07:58.833
We lost contact.

01:07:58.859 --> 01:08:01.101
Melanie was shot because one of your men wouldn't show himself.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.967
I wanna know who the son of a bitch is.

01:08:02.993 --> 01:08:04.938
We'd like to know ourselves. 
- Sir?

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:08.041
It's someone who's smart enough to know
if you're hunting with one bullet...

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.522
you wait for a clean shot.

01:08:09.548 --> 01:08:11.319
What are you saying, Major?

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:15.381
I'm saying, sir, whoever that is down there, he may be our only hope.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:19.385
Our only hope is that Washington complies with this bastard.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.514
Because, any minute now, another one of us is dead.

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:26.392
And you know what?

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.229
I'm afraid it might be me.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.011
Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?

01:08:35.037 --> 01:08:35.969
Yeah, I see it.

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:38.545
Pop it open. 
There should be a red switch.

01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:39.389
Toggle it up.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.658
Hang on.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.203
Okay, we got some indicator lights here.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.456
To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:52.085
There's no switch, Mr President,
so you'll have to cross the wires.

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:53.979
Open the fuel control door.

01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:55.279
Hang on here.

01:08:57.174 --> 01:08:59.509
There should be five of them.

01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:00.719
Do you see them, sir?

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:02.245
Yeah, I see 'em. Yeah.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.550
Jesus. A lot of goddam wires.

01:09:04.576 --> 01:09:06.124
All right, is, um—

01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:10.854
All right, we got five: Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:11.678
- Okay, just hang on.

01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:12.787
Let me double-check something.

01:09:12.813 --> 01:09:14.616
- Come on, man. 
Oh, for Christ's sake, hurry up!

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:17.443
Sir, if you get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds, and the plane will crash.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.988
Well, then, we don't want to get the wrong wire, do we?

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.260
First, cut the green wire.

01:09:22.286 --> 01:09:24.809
Green wire. Okay. Green.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:31.707
- Okay, cut.
- And then, cross that with the-

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.578
With the, with the what?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.987
Hello? Cross it with the what?

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.924
Say again.
Cross the green wire with the, with the-

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:46.264
For Christ's sake.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:51.102
Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.729
Cross with—
Green—

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:59.611
I'm countin' on ya, red, white and blue.

01:10:16.253 --> 01:10:19.923
Sirs, it looks like Air Force One is losing fuel.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.304
We're losing fuel.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.766
Somebody is pumping it out of avionics.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.067
I'm going downstairs.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.487
Take Sergei.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.830
If it isn't us coming out, shoot.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:30.994
A magazine, quickly.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.543
Are you okay?

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.220
Sergei? Kolchak?
What's happening?

01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:53.391
He's dead. Give us a hand.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:08.156
Madam Vice-President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.616
I've been reading through your press kit.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:16.039
I understand Air Force One is able to refuel in midair.

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.887
Well, we need fuel.

01:12:18.913 --> 01:12:20.860
And we need it now.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:24.005
I'm sure we can come to some sort of arrangement.

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:27.175
If you land the plane, we'll trade fuel for hostages.

01:12:27.259 --> 01:12:28.895
This is bullshit.

01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:31.037
It's simple physics.

01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:33.197
Without fuel the plane crashes.

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:34.374
Everybody dies.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.726
We're trying to do everything that we can.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.853
- Tell me what I want to hear...
- I need—

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:41.189
or I will execute a member of the senior staff...

01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:45.068
and continue killing one hostage every minute...

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:49.572
until the plane crash or refuelling plane arrive.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.412
Well, what do you say?

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.958
- Fuel's on its way.
- Thank you.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.465
They'll refuel us.

01:13:10.677 --> 01:13:12.845
Ready.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.818
Everything all right?

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.403
Yes.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.620
Move.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.259
Jim. 
What are you doing here?

01:13:55.285 --> 01:13:57.039
Mr President! 
- I never left.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.644
Gibbs.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.255
Watch the door.

01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:07.258
Where's my family?

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:08.566
They took 'em to another part of the plane.

01:14:08.592 --> 01:14:09.385
We haven't seen them since.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.299
We've got weapons now.

01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:11.721
We should try to retake the plane.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.170
Not while they've got Grace and Alice.

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:14.182
I can't take that chance.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:17.326
What about trying to disable the plane and force them to land?

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.174
I tried to do that. I dumped some fuel.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.189
And now they're gonna refuel us in midair.

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:25.960
- A refuelling tanker? Jesus.
- Sir?

01:14:26.044 --> 01:14:28.746
There may be a way to get these people off the plane.

01:14:28.772 --> 01:14:29.822
What do you mean?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.134
We have emergency parachutes in the tail cone, but we're too high.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:36.012
If we could somehow get a message to the refuelling tanker...

01:14:36.096 --> 01:14:38.264
get him to drop to 15,000 feet, we could jump.

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:40.106
- They've disabled the phones.

01:14:40.132 --> 01:14:41.598
They control the radios.

01:14:41.624 --> 01:14:43.027
- No. M-Mr President?

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.407
Sir? The fax machines.

01:14:44.433 --> 01:14:46.756
Told ya the phone lines are out.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:51.068
No, voice lines and faxes are on two different systems of encryption.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:54.697
You disable one, be very easy to overlook the other.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.244
If this works, you get to be Postmaster General.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.330
- Come with me. Get these people ready to go.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:07.001
Remember: 15,000 feet and 200 knots, otherwise it's suicide.

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:09.045
I don't need this.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.715
Good luck, people.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:23.384
Give me a pen.

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.003
Where are we sending it?
- Situation room.

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:31.234
It makes me so proud, Mr President, that you stuck with us.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:34.612
- Thanks.
- Whatever happens.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:05.810
- Yes!
- Come on.

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:25.788
Madam Vice-President, the Attorney General's here.

01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:31.144
Thank you for coming, Andrew.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:32.139
Hello, Kathryn. Walter.

01:16:32.165 --> 01:16:33.471
- It's good that you're here.

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.590
I'm told that you want my interpretation as to what...

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.842
- the Constitution says about this situation.
- Yes, yes.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:40.678
Now, Andrew, my understanding is that...

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.514
if the president is out of contact in a military situation...

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.183
the Secretary of Defence is in charge as second in command.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.936
- Yes, of course.
- Good. Then that settles it.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.938
It doesn't settle it at all.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:55.318
The president is not merely out of contact, he is also under duress:

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:59.030
His family is held hostage, possibly himself a hostage.

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:03.659
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th Amendment...

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:06.162
uh, surely just as if he'd had, uh, a stroke.

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:09.332
I think the president would dispute that any incapacity exists.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:14.462
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists.

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:18.799
The president may be alive, but he may not be the president.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:22.336
- Madam Vice-President, I think you need to see this.

01:17:22.362 --> 01:17:23.704
...CNN breaking news.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:29.727
We interrupt programming to bring you this breaking news bulletin.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:35.483
CNN has received unconfirmed reports that Air Force One has crashed.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:36.996
Oh, my God.
- The presidential aircraft...

01:17:37.022 --> 01:17:37.885
How'd they get that?

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:38.661
I don't know.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:41.555
Was en route from Moscow when it began its Mayday hail.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.180
I repeat, we have unconfirmed reports...

01:17:43.206 --> 01:17:45.267
Call the pressroom. 
We have to issue a statement.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:48.663
- That the president's plane has crashed in Eastern Europe.
- Walter. General.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.751
This follows an earlier unconfirmed report
of an aborted landing at a U.S. Air base-

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.879
These guys have—

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.103
- Take this.
- Got it.

01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:21.519
Bruce, has Air Force One crashed?

01:18:21.545 --> 01:18:23.681
Look, as far as I know that is a rumour.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.081
Where'd the story come from?

01:18:25.107 --> 01:18:27.309
I don't know where that story came from.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.402
Listen, listen! I cannot confirm anything at this point.

01:18:30.428 --> 01:18:31.913
Anything you can tell us?

01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:33.007
Anything at all?

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:40.881
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a statement.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:48.848
The president's plane, Air Force One, has been hijacked.

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:52.393
- Who are the hijackers?
- Please—

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:55.479
Ladies and gentlemen, please let me finish.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:59.442
For security reasons I cannot divulge
the identity of the hijackers...

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:02.236
or who was on board the plane.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.239
But I am here to assure the American people...

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:08.617
that we are doing everything we can to resolve the situation.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:13.164
For the safety of all the people on the plane...

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.416
I cannot tell you any more than I already have.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.693
I'm sure you understand that.

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.527
Is James Marshall still the president?

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.297
I am coordinating with the National Security Council...

01:19:21.381 --> 01:19:24.175
at the White House pending the president's return...

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.343
and, yes, James Marshall is still the president.

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:31.015
At this time—

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:35.936
At this time I would like to ask all Americans...

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.527
to pray for the safety of everyone on board Air Force One.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.529
Thank you.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.377
Where is the president?

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.055
Everything all right down there?

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.559
Yes.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:45.005
Folks, listen up.
Listen up.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.379
This is your main rip cord.

01:20:46.405 --> 01:20:48.742
As soon as you clear the plane, give it a yank.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:52.531
If your chute doesn't open, this is the lollipop, your reserve chute.

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:53.622
Pull it down. Clear?

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:17.415
Air Force One.

01:21:17.441 --> 01:21:19.773
Air Force One, do you read?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.585
Yes, we read.
Go ahead.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:25.087
Air Force One, this is Extender 1-0.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:28.966
- We have been instructed to refuel you.
- Go ahead.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:33.470
Drop to 15,000 feet and slow to 200 knots.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.181
Acknowledged.
Two hundred.

01:21:41.479 --> 01:21:43.188
They got the fax. 
- Fax.

01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:45.633
Sir, your chute. 
- No, no.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:46.478
Oh, please, sir.

01:21:46.504 --> 01:21:48.469
I'm not leaving without my family.

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:53.198
Okay, Air Force One, you need to open your receptacle door.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:57.620
Pull the yellow lever on the upper control panel.

01:21:57.704 --> 01:22:01.165
- Done.
- Go ahead and close distance, nice and easy.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.837
Almost there.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.561
Where are your chutes, guys?

01:22:10.587 --> 01:22:13.035
We stay with the president, sir.

01:22:14.387 --> 01:22:16.347
Thank you.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.568
All right. That's close enough.

01:22:24.594 --> 01:22:25.714
Here we go!

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:33.707
Go, go! 
- Go!

01:22:33.733 --> 01:22:36.266
Go! Come on! 
Come on!

01:22:37.535 --> 01:22:39.453
Go check. Do it!

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:40.689
Go! You, come on!

01:22:40.715 --> 01:22:42.272
Come on, come on!

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.550
The hostages are gone!

01:23:18.618 --> 01:23:23.205
We've got—
Okay, so far 25 chutes.

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.288
I can't hold her. 
I can't hold her!

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:49.048
What are you doing, Air Force One?

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:51.567
Break away! Break away!

01:23:57.657 --> 01:23:59.992
Sir! Can you reach my hand?

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:13.986
Everybody break!

01:24:14.012 --> 01:24:15.157
Now, now, now!

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:33.567
- Don't move!
- Let me save him!

01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:36.236
He's the president, for God's sake!

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.655
Go get him!

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:49.124
Grab my hand!

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.961
Major!

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:58.342
I got ya.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.187
We have the president.

01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:13.161
We've lost the tanker?

01:25:13.187 --> 01:25:13.966
What else?

01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:15.363
They're counting 32 survivors.

01:25:15.389 --> 01:25:17.261
That means they still have hostages.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.571
- What about the first family?
- No word yet.

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:21.782
Losing hostages will make the terrorists even more desperate.

01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:25.452
Madam Vice-President, we got Air Force One on the line.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:29.289
This is Vice-President Bennett.
We're listening.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:31.291
I now hold hostage...

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:35.838
the president of the United States of America.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:40.968
Soon we shall enter the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan.

01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:46.306
You will cease your military escort at the border.

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.809
If you violate our airspace...

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:53.147
I will execute a member of the first family.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:54.749
- Tell our fighters to back off.
- Right.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:56.508
Let's get NATO on the line and make sure they—

01:25:56.568 --> 01:26:00.112
- I want that B brief-
- Get me Ops.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:06.618
You said a presidential incapacity could be
declared by the majority of the cabinet.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:07.735
Would you sign it?

01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:09.479
Under the circumstances.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.623
See who else would.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.343
Move! Come on. Move!

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.307
Move!

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:31.518
Dad!

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:34.354
Oh, Jim! Jim!

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.798
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.592
I know. If you go, we go.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:02.424
You've been very busy downstairs...

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:06.803
haven't you?

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.973
Killing my men.

01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:30.410
- No!
- You don't wanna do this.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.236
I'm what you came for.

01:27:34.262 --> 01:27:36.108
Don't forget that.

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:38.293
Then I kill them.

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:42.297
Just one. You pick.

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:45.102
That's what you do in the White House.

01:27:45.128 --> 01:27:46.201
You play God.

01:27:53.184 --> 01:27:58.397
Go ahead.
Which one lives?

01:27:58.481 --> 01:27:59.286
I love you.

01:27:59.312 --> 01:28:01.508
I love you. - Go ahead.

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:12.264
You're not here for this.

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.021
You want something.

01:28:15.915 --> 01:28:18.667
- What is it?
- Radek.

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:20.267
How can I do that? I can't do that.

01:28:20.293 --> 01:28:22.154
Well, then you die, the three of you.

01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:23.540
I'll do anything to save my family.

01:28:23.566 --> 01:28:25.157
Don't ask me for something I can't give!

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:29.011
The most powerful man on the earth and now,
suddenly, there are things you cannot do?

01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:30.795
This is very curious.

01:28:30.821 --> 01:28:33.248
Stop with your fuckin' lies!

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:35.392
No!

01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:46.153
Petrov will never give up Radek.

01:28:46.237 --> 01:28:47.602
Petrov is a dog.

01:28:47.628 --> 01:28:50.015
He does what you tell him.

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:56.997
Tell him to do this.

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.426
Petrov used me.

01:28:58.452 --> 01:29:01.860
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed.

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:03.999
He wanted a personal victory.

01:29:04.025 --> 01:29:05.530
Petrov hates Radek.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:07.144
Of course he hates Radek.

01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:09.159
Radek is everything he is not:

01:29:09.218 --> 01:29:12.137
A great man, a strong man.

01:29:12.221 --> 01:29:17.059
Are you saying he would refuse you?

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.951
You'd be playing right into his hands.

01:29:19.977 --> 01:29:21.380
Are you an idiot?

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.482
You'd make him into a hero:

01:29:23.566 --> 01:29:26.318
The man who stopped the terrorists.

01:29:26.402 --> 01:29:29.154
Or better yet, the man who stopped me.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.242
You talk as if you have nothing to do with this.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:39.081
This is all your doing.

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:42.709
This infection you call freedom—

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:45.379
without meaning, without purpose.

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:50.592
You have given my country to gangsters and prostitutes.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:55.639
You have taken everything from us.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:01.269
There is nothing left.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.821
Call him.

01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:21.331
No. No.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:27.246
No. 
- No!

01:30:27.272 --> 01:30:28.613
No! Leave her!

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:31.049
- No!
- Leave her!

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:33.385
- No.
- I have no choice.

01:30:36.013 --> 01:30:36.847
You have the choice.

01:30:36.873 --> 01:30:37.631
Leave her alone.

01:30:37.657 --> 01:30:38.982
This is between you and me.

01:30:39.016 --> 01:30:42.102
You lose a child, it hollows you out.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:43.989
We're soldiers.

01:30:44.015 --> 01:30:46.298
You take my life.

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:50.610
Have you no honour?

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:52.696
- I'll count to five.
- No.

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.906
- It's gonna be all right, honey.
- One.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.784
- It's gonna be all right.
- Two.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:00.036
I'll do it.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.331
- Yes.
- I'll do it.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:11.089
You just leave my family alone.

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:19.514
Leave 'em alone.

01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:41.703
Sir, the president of the United States.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.414
Mr President.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.877
We just got an intercept.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:53.073
The president called Petrov and asked him to release Radek.

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:53.872
He can't do that.

01:31:53.898 --> 01:31:55.158
He must have no choice.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:57.844
We have a choice.

01:31:57.929 --> 01:31:59.971
I have the signatures of the majority of the cabinet...

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:02.516
attesting to the president's incapacity.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.608
Sign it and you can overrule him.

01:32:04.634 --> 01:32:06.336
No, l-I won't do that.

01:32:06.395 --> 01:32:09.397
The United States does not negotiate with terrorists.

01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:11.983
It's been our bedrock principle for 25 years.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:13.403
You can't give in to them now.

01:32:13.429 --> 01:32:15.387
It'll be open season on the United States.

01:32:15.446 --> 01:32:19.241
Many more will die.

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:24.788
Jim isn't making this decision as a president,
he's making it as a husband and a father.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:29.751
History will judge you by what you do right now, Kathryn.

01:32:29.835 --> 01:32:31.920
For God's sake, sign it.

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:50.647
No.

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:08.832
You are released.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:15.255
I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released.

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:18.842
I repeat: General Radek is now being released.

01:33:40.364 --> 01:33:44.576
Yes. Yes. 
General Radek has been released.

01:33:49.373 --> 01:33:52.042
It is confirmed.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:57.464
They are releasing
the general.

01:33:57.548 --> 01:34:01.635
- Now what?
- Now we return to our homeland...

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:04.804
where Radek will decide how best to use you...

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:09.351
now that we know you are willing to negotiate.

01:34:09.435 --> 01:34:12.354
Our nation needs so many things.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:14.846
You said you were gonna release us.

01:34:14.872 --> 01:34:16.591
Forgive me. I lied.

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.319
Listen.

01:36:13.058 --> 01:36:15.977
Honey, stay down. Jim!

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.915
Dad!

01:36:36.999 --> 01:36:37.935
Sir, are you hit?

01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:39.776
Stay with the major, honey.

01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:41.212
Alice, get in the cockpit.

01:36:41.238 --> 01:36:43.196
Don't worry. 
Come on. Lie down.

01:36:43.255 --> 01:36:45.215
Grace?

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:48.885
Grace!

01:36:52.598 --> 01:36:55.099
Jim! Jim!

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.227
Grace!

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:13.116
Let her go!

01:37:13.142 --> 01:37:15.520
Not until Radek is safely away.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.407
Jim! Call it off!

01:37:18.433 --> 01:37:20.149
Don't give up Radek!

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:23.503
If anything happens to the general, your wife will die!

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:25.755
Don't! Jim!

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.513
Comrades.

01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:35.849
Our forces have arrived for the general.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:38.059
They'll pick him up any minute.

01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:40.103
You hear that?

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:42.564
It's almost over, Mr President.

01:38:15.973 --> 01:38:23.980
Drop the gun!

01:38:28.652 --> 01:38:34.198
You make one mistake when you killed my pilot, Mr President.

01:38:34.283 --> 01:38:37.160
No one left to fly the plane.

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:42.999
And no parachute.

01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:48.546
Whatever happens...

01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:51.341
you lose and I win.

01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:48.606
Get off my plane.

01:40:07.459 --> 01:40:11.212
- You all right?
- They're leading the general to the courtyard.

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:16.384
Go. Go! Call Petrov!

01:40:57.009 --> 01:41:00.094
Stop! Don't move.

01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:20.823
They killed him.

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:26.057
They killed Radek!

01:41:26.083 --> 01:41:27.396
Radek is dead.

01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:32.169
He almost got away.

01:41:32.195 --> 01:41:33.897
Did you hear me, sir?

01:41:33.923 --> 01:41:35.138
Radek is dead.

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:36.731
Yes! It's the president.

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.574
We have retaken the plane!

01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:52.605
- How's he doin'?
- Not good, sir.

01:41:52.689 --> 01:41:54.941
- I don't suppose you know how to fly.
- No, sir.

01:41:55.025 --> 01:41:55.980
- Come along, Major.

01:41:56.006 --> 01:41:57.677
I'll need a co-pilot. 
- Yes, sir.

01:41:59.696 --> 01:42:01.676
How long since you've flown, sir?

01:42:01.702 --> 01:42:03.141
Twenty-five years.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.953
Little planes. Never jets.

01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:09.468
Nothin' like this. 
Anybody there?

01:42:09.494 --> 01:42:11.482
Yes, we're here, sir.

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.459
All right.
You got somebody that can help me fly this thing?

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.670
- Sir, this is Colonel Jackson.
- Bob.

01:42:15.754 --> 01:42:17.746
We need to get you out of hostile territory.

01:42:17.772 --> 01:42:18.656
Good idea, Bob.

01:42:18.715 --> 01:42:21.384
I need for you to look above the central video screen.

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.866
There's a series of L.E.D. Numbers.

01:42:23.892 --> 01:42:26.289
Now, one of them should read 110.

01:42:26.348 --> 01:42:28.224
- Got it.
- That's your course heading.

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:31.185
Now, just below there's a knob surrounded by hash marks.

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:35.481
I want you to turn that knob counterclockwise to two-niner-zero.

01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:37.650
Two-niner-zero.

01:42:37.734 --> 01:42:40.027
- We're turnin', Bob.
- Good.

01:42:42.781 --> 01:42:44.873
This course'll take you out of Kazakhstan.

01:42:44.899 --> 01:42:46.017
You're okay, baby.

01:42:46.076 --> 01:42:48.286
Now, sir, we can't land this plane on autopilot...

01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:50.830
so we're gonna need to go over a few things.

01:42:50.914 --> 01:42:54.208
- First, let's plan—
- Where's the nearest safe landing site?

01:42:54.293 --> 01:42:57.503
Incirlik, Turkey.

01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:59.986
General Northwood. 
- Madam?

01:43:00.012 --> 01:43:01.699
What's that?

01:43:01.758 --> 01:43:04.604
Madam Vice-President, that red dot represents MiGs.

01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:07.038
On a course to intercept Air Force One.

01:43:07.097 --> 01:43:09.265
Christ, they took off from Aktyubinsk.

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:12.351
The base commander there is loyal to Radek.

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:16.189
General, send our fighters into Kazakhstan.

01:43:16.273 --> 01:43:18.733
Order them to use any and all means to protect the president.

01:43:18.817 --> 01:43:22.028
When you're on final approach, I want
you to keep the throttles mid-range.

01:43:22.112 --> 01:43:24.530
- Right.
- Mr President, can you hear me?

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:27.700
- Yes, Kathryn.
- We're tracking six MiGs closing on your position.

01:43:27.784 --> 01:43:30.703
I'm sending in our F-15s
to protect you.

01:43:30.787 --> 01:43:33.206
- Shit.
- She say MiGs?

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:34.571
Yeah, she said MiGs.

01:43:34.597 --> 01:43:37.735
Honey, get in that seat and put a seat belt on.

01:43:37.794 --> 01:43:40.880
We're havin' a little trouble here.

01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:45.384
Guys, these MiGs get closer, I'm gonna have to manoeuver this thing.

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:47.247
How do I get it off autopilot?

01:43:47.273 --> 01:43:50.414
Push the button on the yoke by your left thumb.

01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:52.558
I'll try a little, uh, right turn.

01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:54.767
Just keep your moves smooth and steady.

01:43:54.793 --> 01:43:56.045
It's all flying, sir.

01:43:56.104 --> 01:43:58.648
Just step on the ball, huh?

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:00.900
That's right.
Just like riding a bike.

01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:04.528
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit, bearing 090.

01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:06.989
Jettison tanks and push it up.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.164
These MiGs, how far away are they?

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:19.460
Never mind.

01:44:38.021 --> 01:44:39.204
We've got one comin' at us.

01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:40.631
Countermeasures are activated.

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:43.109
Left turn.

01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:49.240
- Jesus Christ!
- We need some help here.

01:44:49.324 --> 01:44:51.016
U.S. Fighters, this is Air Force One.

01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:51.976
We are under attack.

01:44:52.002 --> 01:44:53.169
Where the hell are you?

01:44:53.203 --> 01:44:55.955
Air Force One, this is Halo Flight closing on your position.

01:44:56.039 --> 01:44:57.040
E.T. A: Two minutes.

01:44:57.066 --> 01:44:59.066
We may not be here in two minutes.

01:45:07.009 --> 01:45:09.927
We're hit!

01:45:10.012 --> 01:45:11.546
Christ! Um, we're on fire.

01:45:11.572 --> 01:45:13.164
We got an engine on fire.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:14.626
Number four engine is on fire.

01:45:14.652 --> 01:45:16.334
Pull the fire handle overhead.

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:18.394
Okay, I got it.
 I got it.

01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:22.883
Christ, we're rolling right.

01:45:22.909 --> 01:45:24.884
Left rudder. You have to compensate.

01:45:24.943 --> 01:45:26.512
Should I pull back on number one engine?

01:45:26.538 --> 01:45:27.762
Negative. You'll slow down.

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.864
You have to trim it out.

01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:29.889
How do I do that?

01:45:29.948 --> 01:45:33.576
- Knob. Aft pedestal.
- Jesus Christ!

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.833
We got a red light here. 
Oh, Christ.

01:45:35.859 --> 01:45:37.730
Looks like we're losing fuel.

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:43.210
Halo Flight, everybody lock a bandit.

01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:47.423
Stand by for max range, and Fox three!

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:07.026
Kill one! Kill one!

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:13.808
Kill two! 
Four more bandits bearing 090.

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.309
Halo Flight engage.

01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:21.707
Good guys are here.

01:46:23.293 --> 01:46:24.887
- Air Force One, bug out west.

01:46:24.913 --> 01:46:26.612
We'll cover you. 
- You got it!

01:46:29.007 --> 01:46:29.614
Sir, pull up!

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.829
You got one on your tail!

01:46:30.855 --> 01:46:31.992
Get him off my tail!

01:46:34.137 --> 01:46:34.817
Missile away.

01:46:34.843 --> 01:46:36.831
Air Force One, break left and climb!

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.642
Shit!
Sir, we've lost countermeasures.

01:46:41.144 --> 01:46:42.001
This is Halo Two.

01:46:42.027 --> 01:46:44.296
They've lost countermeasures.
I'm goin' in.

01:46:52.864 --> 01:46:53.599
Two's down!

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:54.803
Halo Two is down!

01:46:54.829 --> 01:46:57.435
Air Force One, are you still with us?

01:46:57.494 --> 01:46:59.703
Yes, we're still here.

01:47:03.959 --> 01:47:05.872
Bandit's above us. Bandit's above us!

01:47:05.898 --> 01:47:07.862
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

01:47:16.555 --> 01:47:18.752
The last three MiGs are bugging out, sir.

01:47:18.778 --> 01:47:19.457
We're clear!

01:47:19.516 --> 01:47:21.392
Yes!

01:47:23.353 --> 01:47:25.560
Bob, are you still there? 
- Yes, sir.

01:47:25.586 --> 01:47:27.673
We've a little problem here.

01:47:27.732 --> 01:47:28.896
My rudder is sluggish.

01:47:28.922 --> 01:47:30.509
Let me take a look, sir.

01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:39.285
Oh, man. 
Sir, you're torn up pretty bad out here.

01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:41.328
Do you have any elevator control?

01:47:41.413 --> 01:47:42.585
Sluggish too.

01:47:42.611 --> 01:47:45.316
And we're still losing fuel.

01:47:45.375 --> 01:47:47.501
Okay.

01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:49.758
We got a problem up here.

01:47:49.784 --> 01:47:52.823
Sirs, Air Force One is badly hit.

01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:55.759
With the damage, there's no way they can land.

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:03.642
I'm sorry, sir.

01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:05.000
Thanks for your help.

01:48:05.026 --> 01:48:07.087
I'll stay on your wing, sir.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:11.150
Take it straight and steady until we figure out what to do.

01:48:11.234 --> 01:48:13.235
Sir...

01:48:15.071 --> 01:48:16.906
you did great.

01:48:37.135 --> 01:48:38.238
They can't control the plane.

01:48:38.264 --> 01:48:40.204
The engines are failing, and they're losing fuel.

01:48:40.263 --> 01:48:42.223
There must be something we can do to help them.

01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:46.769
- General, is that our airstrip strike team?
- Yeah. Why?

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:49.522
I just had a wild idea.

01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:52.066
Time is critical.
Start turning north.

01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:55.694
- You'll get more details en route.
- Yes, sir.

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:58.614
Change of orders acknowledged.

01:49:03.078 --> 01:49:05.079
Try to hold your heading, sir.

01:49:05.163 --> 01:49:09.041
They'll be rejoining from the south in about 25 minutes.

01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:12.253
- All right. - We know it's risky.
- Understood.

01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:14.505
But we are all out of options.

01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:18.384
- Dad?
- Yeah, baby?

01:49:18.468 --> 01:49:19.665
It'll be okay.

01:49:19.691 --> 01:49:21.912
Everything's gonna work.

01:49:37.195 --> 01:49:39.572
Concerned Americans have gathered here at the White House...

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:44.368
to await word on the president and his family,
but CNN has learned that Air Force One...

01:49:44.452 --> 01:49:47.871
is severely crippled and virtually unlandable.

01:49:47.956 --> 01:49:51.250
Sources report that the first family is still trapped on board...

01:49:51.334 --> 01:49:55.254
and a daring midair rescue operation is said to be under way.

01:49:58.133 --> 01:50:00.467
Air Force One, this is Liberty 2-4, approaching on your left side.

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:03.429
- Do you read?
- Air Force One, loud and clear.

01:50:03.513 --> 01:50:05.157
Gibbs, they're here.

01:50:05.183 --> 01:50:06.415
Get the door.

01:50:06.474 --> 01:50:09.268
- Yes, sir.
- We'll need 10,000 feet, 200 knots.

01:50:09.352 --> 01:50:11.729
We gotta get her slowed down now.

01:50:13.064 --> 01:50:16.317
Air Force One and Liberty 2-4, this is AWACS Blue Star.

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:19.028
We have you on radar contact.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:34.168
Liberty 2-4, they're almost out of fuel.

01:50:34.252 --> 01:50:35.136
Roger, Blue Star.

01:50:35.162 --> 01:50:37.863
Air Force One, you've got to keep the wings level.

01:50:37.922 --> 01:50:41.717
If the engines fail, sacrifice altitude to maintain airspeed.

01:50:47.557 --> 01:50:50.447
- Ready!
- Liberty 2-4, ramp leader.

01:50:50.473 --> 01:50:52.503
First man is on his way.

01:50:52.562 --> 01:50:55.481
Back up. Easy.

01:50:55.565 --> 01:50:58.192
Air Force One, come left six.

01:51:01.863 --> 01:51:02.742
- How's my speed?

01:51:02.768 --> 01:51:04.428
- It's good. Everything's good.

01:51:04.454 --> 01:51:05.791
See if you can hold it.

01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:07.896
A little more left, sir.

01:51:07.922 --> 01:51:09.561
Three, two, stop.

01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:21.573
Take my arm!

01:51:21.599 --> 01:51:23.701
Pull me in!

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.136
Come on! Come on!

01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:30.445
Unhook me!

01:51:30.471 --> 01:51:32.584
I got it! I got it!

01:51:32.644 --> 01:51:34.603
Good!

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:38.113
Liberty locked in.

01:51:38.139 --> 01:51:39.925
Where's the president?

01:51:39.984 --> 01:51:42.403
Up in the cockpit.

01:51:53.915 --> 01:51:55.065
Just lost another engine.

01:51:55.091 --> 01:51:57.067
Liberty, we just lost another engine.

01:51:57.127 --> 01:51:59.882
Liberty 2-4, acknowledged.

01:51:59.908 --> 01:52:02.239
Sir, time to go.

01:52:02.298 --> 01:52:03.671
Who's gonna fly the plane?

01:52:03.697 --> 01:52:05.492
I'll take care of that, sir.

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:08.095
- Got it.
- Go!

01:52:08.179 --> 01:52:09.461
Ramp to pilot.

01:52:09.487 --> 01:52:11.957
Second P.J.'s on the way.

01:52:21.025 --> 01:52:22.688
Mr President, this way.

01:52:22.714 --> 01:52:24.303
My family first.

01:52:24.362 --> 01:52:27.990
- Sir, I have orders to take you off this aircraft.
- Them first.

01:52:31.327 --> 01:52:33.746
Blue Star, the third parajumper is boarding Air Force One.

01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:35.046
Standing by for recovery.

01:52:35.072 --> 01:52:37.357
Roger. Moving into the receiver position.

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:45.257
- Dad?
- You'll be all right, honey.

01:52:45.341 --> 01:52:48.927
- Promise?
- Promise. Close your eyes.

01:52:49.012 --> 01:52:52.264
You can do it.
Just hold on tight.

01:52:52.348 --> 01:52:55.017
It's okay. Don't worry.

01:52:59.981 --> 01:53:03.984
- She's okay.
- Ah, Dad!

01:53:05.862 --> 01:53:06.757
Hang on! Hang on!

01:53:06.783 --> 01:53:09.097
Ramp to pilot. We got her.
We got her.

01:53:09.157 --> 01:53:10.975
Got her? 
Here you go.

01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:12.559
Yeah. I got you.

01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:18.624
I'm right behind you.

01:53:29.093 --> 01:53:30.213
That's it. Come on.

01:53:30.239 --> 01:53:31.829
There, get your hand!

01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:34.139
Just hang on! Hang on!

01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:35.926
- You're next, sir.
- Him next.

01:53:35.952 --> 01:53:37.334
He's wounded. 
- Yes, sir.

01:53:37.393 --> 01:53:38.239
No, you go.

01:53:38.265 --> 01:53:40.879
Come on, Shep. Come on, pal.

01:53:47.278 --> 01:53:49.863
We've lost another engine.

01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:56.052
Air Force One, you're sinking too fast.

01:53:56.078 --> 01:53:58.438
We only have time for one more retrieval.

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:02.204
We're passing 3,000 feet.

01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:04.319
Impact in less than two minutes.

01:54:04.379 --> 01:54:07.005
Get the president out of there!

01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.467
Right here! Right here!

01:54:09.493 --> 01:54:11.869
Easy there. Hurry up!

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:14.905
- He's on.
- Sir, get your harness ready!

01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:16.206
It's time to go!

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:17.495
What about the other team?

01:54:17.521 --> 01:54:19.459
There's no time for the other team.

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.216
I can only take one more.

01:54:21.242 --> 01:54:23.005
No! We're all going!

01:54:23.064 --> 01:54:24.579
- That's impossible, sir.

01:54:24.605 --> 01:54:26.967
I have to take you. 
- Mr President...

01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:29.987
it's time to get you off this plane.

01:54:30.071 --> 01:54:32.114
Go, sir. Go!

01:54:34.158 --> 01:54:36.785
Please, go.

01:54:45.461 --> 01:54:47.629
It was you?

01:55:00.852 --> 01:55:01.985
Give me the strap.

01:55:02.011 --> 01:55:04.087
I trusted you with my life.

01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:06.328
So will the next president.

01:55:06.354 --> 01:55:08.050
Now, give it to me!

01:55:10.945 --> 01:55:12.362
You have to release the cable.

01:55:12.388 --> 01:55:14.181
We're descending through 1,200 feet.

01:55:16.367 --> 01:55:18.827
I'm getting off this plane!

01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:35.510
Seven hundred.

01:55:37.388 --> 01:55:39.640
Five hundred.
We have to pull up.

01:56:09.504 --> 01:56:12.297
Blue Star, Air Force One is down.

01:56:12.382 --> 01:56:15.092
I repeat, Air Force One is down.

01:56:15.176 --> 01:56:17.719
Liberty 2-4, do you have the president?

01:56:21.432 --> 01:56:22.703
Shift your weight around!

01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:23.542
You can do it!

01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:31.108
- Liberty, do you have the president?
- Stand by.

01:56:31.192 --> 01:56:33.694
Wind him in! Wind him in!

01:56:44.956 --> 01:56:48.834
- That's it!
- Hang on, sir! Hang on!

01:56:48.918 --> 01:56:51.878
We got him!

01:56:54.257 --> 01:56:56.883
Liberty 2-4 is changing call signs.

01:56:56.968 --> 01:56:59.344
Liberty 2-4 is now Air Force One.

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:12.983
Mr President, welcome aboard, sir.
