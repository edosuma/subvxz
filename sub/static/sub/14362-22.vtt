- And that just goes to show you--
- Oh, okay.

Dad, we didn't leave
Uncle Rusty, did we?

'Cause as someone

on more than one occasion,

it's not a good feeling.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.344
No, I told him we were leaving.

He's meeting

I'm a super competitive person.

it was classic Uncle Rusty.

What does that mean?

You know, like, when he made you
take that test for him

18:16.332 --> 18:18.033
or when he sold
all your clothes.
