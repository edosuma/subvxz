   Ladies and Gentlemen,  
welcome to the Drake Show.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.047
 Tonight's special episode
is going to be filled with

05:47.080 --> 05:51.785
thrills, and chills, and 
my own personal favorite.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.687
Lots and lots of
  that red shit 

05:53.720 --> 05:57.724

 all our bodies. 

06:00.327 --> 06:01.628

  They're going to   
fucking kill me here!

06:11.972 --> 06:14.708
<i>Somebody say something!</i>
<i>Don't just stand there!</i>

06:14.741 --> 06:17.110
You know, ever since our 
mother brought Logan home

06:17.143 --> 06:20.647
from the hospital, I knew
he was a fucking coward. 

06:20.680 --> 06:22.382
<i>[muffled speaking]</i>

06:22.415 --> 06:23.917

You'll never fucking
    see me again.   

06:25.919 --> 06:28.288
Just please, I can't
feel my legs, Drake.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.856
He wants mercy from the Drake.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.491
From the Drake...

06:31.524 --> 06:34.394
  And he should know  
better than anybody...

06:34.427 --> 06:36.062
mercy ain't my style.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.631
What do you want from me?

06:37.664 --> 06:40.901
Logan is no longer my brother.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.570
Our relationship 
has been severed.

06:43.603 --> 06:48.174
  And now he's all  
alone in this world,

06:48.208 --> 06:50.777

You can't let him
    do this!     

06:56.883 --> 06:58.451
 It's not just MY 
life he's ruining.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.053
<i>Please.</i> 
<i>Help me.</i>

07:08.628 --> 07:10.130
You're a fucking animal Drake!

07:10.163 --> 07:12.632
You're a shitty fucking
 weird little animal.  

07:12.666 --> 07:17.137
The way I see it, I'm a
fucking miracle worker,

07:17.170 --> 07:20.407

  your legs now?  

07:46.132 --> 07:47.200
Can ya?
 Huh!  

07:47.233 --> 07:49.436
Was there something else
you wanted to say to me?

Why?

15:06.639 --> 15:08.374
Does that frighten you?

15:08.408 --> 15:12.111
  If you've got money to    
spend, nothing frightens me.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.578
Not if they give a
fuck about living.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.548
So how many people
have you killed?  

15:48.581 --> 15:51.851
   What am I?   
A mathematician?

from your rotten skin.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.332
 Well you better cut 
one to Mother Theresa

16:39.365 --> 16:40.867
so you can give it
to her while she's

16:40.900 --> 16:43.269

What did you think?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.120
 He was gonna put a 
ring on your finger?

  chief of police now.   

17:47.233 --> 17:48.935
Good day sir.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.470
No, no please,
 take a seat. 

17:53.039 --> 17:55.908
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.511
 <i>Let me guess, you</i>  
<i>rode in on the rail?</i>

17:58.544 --> 18:00.446
That's right.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.016
So I understand you've been
        having a little bit

18:04.050 --> 18:07.253
of difficulty with one
   of our young men.  

18:07.286 --> 18:08.688
[sighs]

18:08.721 --> 18:11.857
Well, I think you're gonna
need a lot of dump trucks.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.893
Dump trucks?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.328
I don't follow you.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.029
  You get out there,  
get all the criminals,

18:17.063 --> 18:18.164
put 'em in dump trucks.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.767
Take em to a landfill
 site and bury them. 

18:21.801 --> 18:24.036
Put 'em in the ground.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.471
I'm not too sure

18:25.504 --> 18:28.074
I know what you're trying
        to say here, sir.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.376
What I'm trying
to say is that 

18:30.409 --> 18:35.548
people don't go bad
like they do here. 

18:35.581 --> 18:38.117
        Look,       
if I'm being honest,

18:38.150 --> 18:41.153
I can't argue with
 anything you say.

 <i>Crime in this city has</i>

18:59.939 --> 19:02.808
You better get those officers
       and send them packing.

19:02.842 --> 19:07.213
  And start this whole   
operation all over again.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.448

 you and your brother to bed.

 <i>can I...</i> 

25:27.126 --> 25:30.863
tell you something
   about bears?   

25:30.896 --> 25:33.265
Sure.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.672
<i>The bear is a solitary animal.</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:43.876
<i>They like their space.</i>

25:43.909 --> 25:47.780
They live in a magic circle.

They mind if you're
 like a mile away, 

25:50.749 --> 25:53.919
   but if you get   
inside their circle,

25:53.952 --> 25:56.722
<i>they will maul you.</i>

25:56.755 --> 25:59.992
If a bear's claw would
ever strike your face,

26:00.025 --> 26:04.229
 it would take your whole 
face right off your skull.

<i>nose, your lips.</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:08.333

And you would die from it.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.738
Wow.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.840
 I didn't know bears
could be so vicious.

26:14.873 --> 26:18.444
  They are   
wild animals.

26:20.612 --> 26:26.185
There's something else about
 bears not many people know.

26:26.218 --> 26:30.389
 <i>If a bear gets hooked on</i>
<i>the taste of human blood,</i>

26:30.422 --> 26:34.860
he becomes a man killer.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.830
He'll go on a rampage

26:37.863 --> 26:40.432
and has to be destroyed

26:42.868 --> 26:45.304

26:45.337 --> 26:50.976

That's funny,

 Yeah, 
are ya?

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.618

and have a good night's rest.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:56.092
     But other people,     
they don't got beds at all.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.294
Instead they gotta
 find an alleyway,

  <i>or a park bench where some</i> 
<i>fucker's not gonna stab them.</i>

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:03.966
  <i>But just because</i> 
<i>they don't got beds</i>

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.802
   <i>doesn't mean</i>  
<i>they're homeless.</i>

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:09.939
 Cause guess what, they've got
the biggest home of any of us.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.709
It's called the Streets!

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:16.546
<i>And right now, we're all</i>
<i>standing in their home,</i> 

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:21.684
  <i>so maybe we should show</i>  
<i>them some god damn respect.</i>

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.286
<i>If this is their home,</i>

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.922
  they've got a right to  
keep it clean, don't they?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.624
<i>And sometimes on the streets,</i>

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:31.427
 a broom just ain't  
gonna fucking cut it.

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:34.330
   That's when you  
gotta get a shotgun!

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:37.767
 So if you want to
kill me, go ahead.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.469
But I'll warn you.

Tonight I have a special
   treat for you all.   

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:30.353
The culmination of one of
the bloodiest spectacles 

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.088
we have ever witnessed.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:35.091
 Everybody please

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.960

<i>A man I'm sure you've</i>

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.547
Ladies and Gentlemen,
without further ado, 

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.616
let's bring on the
 man of the hour. 

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:06.622
<i>The one responsible for the</i>
 <i>death of my favorite son.</i> 

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.391
<i>And here he is,</i>

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:14.063

Get your hands off me,
      you demons!     

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.768
You're crushing my smokes.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.736
When God lost his son,

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.105
he knew he'd get him
 back in a few days.

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.341
 <i>He never had to mourn,</i> 
<i>not for a single second.</i>

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:28.311
   <i>But, I know I</i>   
<i>can't get son back.</i>

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.346
          So,          
what does that make me,

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:33.316
when I know more about pain

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:37.687
than the most powerful
being in the universe?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.389
You're a fool.

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:43.359
And a shitty father.

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.232
Take him to the glory hole.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.908
Look up at all those people.

<i>I'm your God.</i>

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:04.480
<i>They fear me more</i>
  <i>than anything.</i> 

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:09.485
<i>And that fear is what saves</i>
   <i>their lives everyday.</i>   

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.921
 If I want something
from them I take it.

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.956
<i>If they try to fight</i>
 <i>back I kill them.</i>  

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.124
Fucker.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:17.193
They live to please me.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.995
Because if they don't,

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:21.264

fucking heads!

Eventually,
  evil...  

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:42.084
will turn against evil.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:44.420
