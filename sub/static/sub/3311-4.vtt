WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:09.043
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.380
HOW BLEEPIN' DIFFICULT
IS IT FOR YOU PEOPLE

00:12.413 --> 00:14.748
TO FIND A BLEEPIN' PAIR OF
SHOES IN THIS BLEEPIN' HOUSE?

00:14.782 --> 00:16.250
ARE ANY OF THESE THEM?

00:16.284 --> 00:18.686
NO. RHONDA... BLUE!
OKAY? TRY AGAIN.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.388
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:20.421 --> 00:23.491
I'M SENSING THERE MAY BE A
"BLEEPIN'" PROBLEM IN HERE.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.993
WE'RE AT DEFCON 2. WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE WITH MY BLUE PUMPS?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.662
- ME? WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE WITH YOUR SHOES?
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GOES AROUND

00:28.696 --> 00:30.464
PICKING THINGS UP AND
PUTTING THEM AWAY.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.566
YES. I INTENTIONALLY LIKE
HIDING YOUR FOOTWEAR

00:32.600 --> 00:34.535
SO THAT YOU HAVE THE
PLEASURE OF SEARCHING FOR IT

00:34.568 --> 00:36.704
SO THAT EVERY DAY FEELS
LIKE EASTER SUNDAY.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.739
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING ALL
DRESSED UP FOR ANYWAY

00:38.772 --> 00:40.641
IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
A CITY COUNCIL MEETING?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.177
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE
TO SEE THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:43.211 --> 00:44.745
TAKING GOVERNMENT
MATTERS SERIOUSLY.

00:44.778 --> 00:48.682
AND NOTHING SAYS "SERIOUS" LIKE
HIGH HEELS AND A PLUNGING NECKLINE.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.584
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.420
GO! LOOK. FIND.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.255
YOU KNOW WHAT? A
"PLEASE" WOULDN'T HURT.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.589
- PLEASE.
- OUCH.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.359
THANKS. COULDN'T
DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.094
HE'S SO SENSITIVE SOMETIMES.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.263
WE ARE GONNA BE LATE TO THE
TRANSPORTATION HEARING.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.532
OH, WE'RE DITCHING IT.
YEAH, JUST THIS ONCE.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.534
I THOUGHT YOU AND I COULD
CHECK OUT THAT NEW BAR

01:06.567 --> 01:08.236
WE KEEP SAYING WE'RE
GONNA HIT AND NEVER DO.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.572
OOH, I WAS THERE LAST NIGHT.
IT WAS CRAZY HOT.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.807
BUT SO LONELY WITHOUT YOU.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.810
LOOK, I SPEND ALL DAY AT MY JOB...
THAT I LOVE...

01:16.844 --> 01:19.380
THEN I COME HOME TO THESE FREAKIN' KIDS...
THAT I LOVE...

01:19.413 --> 01:21.482
BUT I JUST NEED A LITTLE
ME TIME, YOU KNOW?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.584
A LITTLE SELF-LOVE.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.154
- I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.
- OKAY.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.589
LET'S FIND YOUR SHOES AND HIT THE BAR.
FIRST ROUND'S ON ME.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.559
OH HEY, UM, NOBODY
CAN KNOW, OKAY?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.627
I JUST DON'T WANT JUDGEY
LOOKS FROM THE KIDS AND JOE.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.496
Joe: I THINK I FOUND 'EM.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.332
BECAUSE... THAT'S WHY THIS
TRANSPORTATION HEARING IS SO VITAL.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.268
- MMM.
- HEY, JOE.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.736
SORRY. I USUALLY PUT THESE
BACK AFTER I WEAR THEM.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.740
WOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
FIND ANYTHING IN HERE.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.076
IT'S LIKE BEING INSIDE
A WOMAN'S MIND.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.779
IF THIS WERE MY MIND,
IT WOULD BE PARIS.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.814
AND YOU WOULD BE AN
UNLIMITED CREDIT CARD.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.651
YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE
A SYSTEM HERE.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.321
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD GET
ONE OF THOSE CLOSET COMPANIES

02:00.354 --> 02:02.156
TO COME IN HERE AND
REORGANIZE EVERYTHING.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.325
WHAT? THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.
I COULD DO THAT.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.494
- THAT COULD WORK.
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.729
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER LET A MAN
MESS AROUND IN MY CLOSET.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.866
A WOMAN'S CLOSET IS HER MOST
SACRED, INTIMATE, PERSONAL SPACE.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.336
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS
PIZZA A WEEK AGO.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.606
FINE. HAVE AT IT.
WORK YOUR MAGIC.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
GREAT. I WILL GET
STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

02:20.674 --> 02:24.111
OH, AND BEFORE I DO, IF THERE'S
ANY SPECIFIC PERSONAL ITEMS,

02:24.144 --> 02:26.180
YOU MAY WANT TO RELOCATE
THEM PRIOR TO...

02:27.248 --> 02:29.650
OH YES! OH.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.819
- ( laughs )
- ( clattering )

02:33.754 --> 02:36.624
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:36.657 --> 02:38.926
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:41.795 --> 02:44.565
HOW ABOUT "FLESHEATERS
2: MORE FLESH EATING"?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.600
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I NEVER
SAW "FLESHEATERS 1."

02:46.634 --> 02:48.236
I HATE NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.605
WELL, THEY'RE FLESHEATERS
AND THEY EAT FLESH.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.542
I'M ALL CAUGHT UP THEN.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.211
WELL, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
DON'T WAIT UP.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.380
THESE TRANSPORTATION
HEARINGS CAN TAKE FOREVER.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.649
BUT THAT'S MY JOB, SO WHOO!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.718
OH HEY. IS IT OKAY IF I MEET
JUSTIN AT THE MALL TOMORROW?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.720

03:08.256 --> 03:10.624
DON'T WE WANT TO KNOW
WHO THIS JUSTIN GUY IS?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.393
YES. YES WE DO.

03:12.426 --> 03:16.196
- SOME GUY.
- JUST SOME DROPPED-OUT-OF-SCHOOL GUY.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.499
- WHAT?
- HE DID NOT DROP OUT.

03:18.532 --> 03:22.403
HE FLUNKED SENIOR YEAR AND DECIDED
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS CAR.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.440
WHO NEEDS AN EDUCATION? IT
JUST LEADS TO A FUTURE.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.908
IT'S LAME.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.379
OKAY, NOT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD
NEEDS A HIGH-SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.381
JUSTIN ALREADY HAS A JOB.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.882
YEAH, DELIVERING PIZZA.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.751
OH, DID HE DELIVER YOUR FACE?

03:37.785 --> 03:40.954
OKAY OKAY, FINE. MALL... JUST THE MALL.
I GOTTA GO.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.390
HEY!

03:43.757 --> 03:46.794
JUST REAL FAST. UM...

03:46.827 --> 03:49.663
DROPPED-OUT PIZZA-DELIVER-BOY...
HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THAT?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.399
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CRUSH.

03:51.432 --> 03:55.269
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S HOOKING UP
WITH CHARLES MANSON... OR SHEEN.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.838
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, 'CAUSE BOTH THOSE
GUYS ACTUALLY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL.

03:57.871 --> 04:01.909
UM, I'M JUST SAYING THAT BAD
BOYS ARE USUALLY CALLED BAD BOYS

04:01.942 --> 04:03.744
FOR, YOU KNOW, A REASON.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.680
JOE, IT'S A MALL. THEY
CAN'T HAVE SEX THERE...

04:06.714 --> 04:09.617
NOT EVEN AT BROOKSTONE, OKAY?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.619
NOW PLEASE LET ME
GET OUT OF HERE...

04:11.652 --> 04:14.288
BECAUSE I HAVE CITIZENS
WAITING TO YELL AT ME.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.393
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE STOCK TIP.
THAT WAS JUST SO...

04:19.427 --> 04:21.362
TEDIOUS.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.531
OH, WHAT A BUST.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.334
I WONDER IF I CAN CATCH THE END
OF THAT TRANSPORTATION HEARING.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.469
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF
MEN WITH HAIR HERE.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.670
CHECK THOSE GUYS OUT.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.639
PLEASE, "LAWYERPALOOZA"?

04:31.672 --> 04:35.008
THERE'S NOTHING SEXY ABOUT
BORING SUITS WITH A BLACKBERRY.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.244
OH, BUT ON YOU IT'S ADORABLE.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.480
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD
THIS ALL NIGHT,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.649
BUT THOSE ARE SOME
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SHOES.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.518
- AND THEY MATCH YOUR EYES.
- REALLY?

04:44.552 --> 04:45.786
REALLY?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.888
FIRST THING I NOTICED
WHEN I WALKED IN HERE.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.990
WELL, THAT AND YOUR SMILE.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.693
REALLY?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.795
NOW LET ME GUESS... I'M
VERY GOOD AT THIS.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.030
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A
PILATES INSTRUCTOR.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.801
AND YOU'RE A PRINCESS OF SOME KIND.
HOW'D I DO?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.803
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.938
- WHAT ARE YOU LADIES DRINKING?
- SURPRISE ME.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.541
- VODKA ROCKS.
- YES IT DOES.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.743
- BACK IN A JIFF.
- YUM!

05:09.777 --> 05:13.347
SHOW SOME DIGNITY. I'LL
WRESTLE YOU FOR HIM.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.016
RHONDA, YOU'RE MY FRIEND;
YOU'RE MY RIGHT-HAND WOMAN.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.853
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT OVER A GUY.
YOU'RE FIRED.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.855
THAT'S GONNA BE $12.

05:21.889 --> 05:25.359
OH, YOU'RE THE BARTENDER...
TENDING BAR.

05:25.393 --> 05:28.429
WELL, I ONLY DO THIS ON THE NIGHTS
WHEN I'M NOT PLAYING GUITAR.

05:28.462 --> 05:32.666
OKAY, LET'S WRESTLE.
MUD, OIL OR JELL-O?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.468
ENGLISH MUFFIN'S ALL YOURS.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.771
I LIKE 'EM TALL, DARK, AND
NECK-DEEP IN LAW-SCHOOL DEBT.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.708
HEY, NICE BLACKBERRY.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.711
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY, PRINCESS? I
CAN'T IMAGINE YOU'RE A LAWYER.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.780
NO, I WORK FOR THE CITY.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.818
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT A COP, BECAUSE I
KIND OF HAVE A SPEEDING PROBLEM.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.955
WELL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.426
WOW, LOOK AT THAT SCAR.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.595
YOU MUST HAVE REALLY SCREWED
UP SOME GUY'S DRINK ORDER.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.331
NO, I LEARNED THE HARD WAY,
IF YOU'RE GONNA PARASAIL,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.700
DON'T DO IT IN
SHARK-INFESTED WATER.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.770
I JUST SPENT HALF AN
HOUR HITTING ON A GUY

06:09.803 --> 06:13.073
BEFORE I REALIZED I ALREADY DATED
AND DUMPED HIM A YEAR AGO.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.609
IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL
THEM APART IN THOSE SUITS.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.711
YOU REALLY HAVE TO START A
TAG-AND-RELEASE PROGRAM.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.713
THAT'S IT... TIME TO HEAD HOME.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.783
OH WAIT, YOU'RE MY RIDE. CAN YOU
JUST HANG OUT A FEW MORE MINUTES?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.819
BUT IF WE LEAVE NOW, I STILL HAVE TIME
TO WATCH A RERUN OF "SEX AND THE CITY"

06:25.853 --> 06:27.888
WHILE CRYING BITTERLY TO MY CAT.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.659
BUT HE'S A GUITAR PLAYER
WHO SWIMS WITH SHARKS.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.760
UH, I CAN GIVE YOU A LIFT...

06:32.793 --> 06:35.128
IF YOU DON'T MIND RIDING
ON THE BACK OF A HARLEY.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.465
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
( opera playing )

06:56.984 --> 06:59.487
I LIKE RHONDA'S NEW BIKE.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.624
AH, THANKS FOR TAKING
THE SCENIC ROUTE HOME.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.392
ISN'T THE RIVER
BEAUTIFUL AT NIGHT?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.160
I VOTED TO CLEAN IT UP.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.097
HI. I'M JOE.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.965
HELLO, MATE. I'M DYLAN.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.968
- HEY.
- DYLAN IS MY NEW FRIEND

07:15.002 --> 07:18.038
THAT I JUST BEFRIENDED.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.707
OH, AT THE
TRANSPORTATION HEARING?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.075
YEAH, TONIGHT'S TOPIC
WAS ABOUT CARPOOLING

07:22.109 --> 07:23.911
AND MOTORCYCLE-POOLING.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.979
AMAZING.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.049
YEAH, SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
SOMEONE WOULD BE WAITING UP.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.852
NO WORRIES. I'M FAMILIAR
WITH OPEN RELATIONSHIPS.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.854
OH GOD NO, WE DON'T HAVE
AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.689
NO, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY RELATIONSHIP.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.658
WELL, WE HAVE A WORKING RELATIONSHIP...
I'M HIS BOSS.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.727
- TECHNICALLY I'M FREELANCE.
- HE'S MY NANNY.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.662
IT'S A VERY TEMPORARY
SITUATION ACTUALLY.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.096
I HEAR YA.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.165
I'M ONLY BARTENDING TILL
MY MUSIC CAREER KICKS IN.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.834
I'M A SINGER/SONGWRITER.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.736
OF COURSE HE IS.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.204
HOW LONG YOU BEEN A BARTENDER?

07:51.238 --> 07:54.708
UH, IN APRIL, THAT'LL
BE 12 YEARS.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.046
KINDA HARD TO QUIT.
LADIES LOVE A BARTENDER.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.951
YEAH. I'M SURE BONO IS JUST BIDING
HIS TIME TILL HE GETS YOUR JOB.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
WELL, I BETTER HIT THE TRAIL.

08:05.586 --> 08:09.189
ABSOLUTELY. 'CAUSE THAT...
THAT TRAIL NEEDS SOME HITTING.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.992
OH, ALMOST FORGOT...

08:17.164 --> 08:19.733
WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT
COULD HAVE MADE THAT HOTTER

08:19.767 --> 08:21.969
IS IF MY NANNY WEREN'T WATCHING.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.008
( engine starts )

08:28.041 --> 08:31.779
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

08:33.246 --> 08:37.084
SO THAT WAS DYLAN, HUH?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.086
YES IT WAS...

08:39.119 --> 08:41.855
DYLAN McENGLAND.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
WAS THERE EVEN A HEARING
AT ALL TONIGHT?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.196
THERE WAS A HEARING. I
JUST DIDN'T GO TO IT.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.531
I GET IT, YOU KNOW? YOU
SPEND ALL YOUR FREE TIME

08:51.565 --> 08:53.701
TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS. YOU NEED
TO BLOW OFF A LITTLE BIT OF STEAM.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.803
I'M NOT YOUR DAD, YOU KNOW?
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.571
I CERTAINLY CAN DO WHAT I WANT,

08:57.605 --> 09:02.142
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT BEING JUDGED BY
MY NANNY-PERSON-WAITER-UPPER GUY.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.844
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

09:03.877 --> 09:07.681
HE'S JUST NOT WHAT I PICTURED AS
MEL BURKE-BOYFRIEND MATERIAL.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.251
- THAT'S ALL.
- OH, YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME PICTURING THAT, DO YOU?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.553
UH, NO NO. IT'S JUST
THAT WHEN I DO,

09:13.587 --> 09:16.556
I IMAGINE SOMEBODY
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

09:16.590 --> 09:19.760
SPECIFICALLY JUST
A LITTLE MORE...

09:19.793 --> 09:21.729
JUST NOT HIM.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.632
YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT
YOUR BUSINESS, JOE.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.566
OKAY? I DON'T NEED YOU ALL
UP IN MY PERSONAL LIFE.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.736
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.739
OH YEAH, I GOT THOSE DIVIDERS FOR
YOUR BRA DRAWER WE TALKED ABOUT.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.240
- OH THANK YOU!
- YEAH OKAY.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.145
HEY MEL, DID YOU EVER
READ "MOBY DICK"?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.848
OF COURSE I DID. WELL, I MEAN
I READ THE CLIFF'S NOTES...

09:40.881 --> 09:42.750
WELL, I SAW THE MOVIE...
PART OF THE MOVIE.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.719
HEY, I SAW "JAWS"!

09:45.753 --> 09:48.989
WHOA WHOA WHOA, YOU BETTER JUST BE
TAKING THOSE OUTSIDE FOR SOME FRESH AIR.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.724
I'M TAKING THESE BABIES TO
GOODWILL ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.827
OH, THIS IS THE SKIRT THAT GOT ME
BACKSTAGE AT THE 'N SYNC CONCERT.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.729
AND I... NEVER MIND.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.866
OH, I WANT TO KEEP THIS...

09:58.899 --> 10:00.734
AND THIS. AND THIS!

10:00.768 --> 10:02.636
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WEAR ANY OF THOSE.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.338
BUT I STILL WANT THEM.
THEY'RE LIKE MUSEUM PIECES.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.741
WHAT MUSEUM? THE "SLUTSONIAN"?

10:07.775 --> 10:10.610
( laughs )

10:10.644 --> 10:11.812
AHEM!

10:11.845 --> 10:15.348
WHOA, THAT MOBY DICK
IS ONE CRAZY WHALE.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.587
WOW. AWESOME SKIRT.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.623
- SEE?
- IT'S SO ANCIENT, IT'S RETRO.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.793
WELL, LOOK AT THAT, BURKE. IT'S BEEN
SO LONG SINCE YOU'VE BEEN COOL,

10:25.826 --> 10:27.795
IT'S FINALLY COMING BACK
AROUND AND YOU'RE COOL AGAIN.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.862
I GET IT, I GET IT.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.831
CAN I BORROW THIS
SATURDAY NIGHT?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.733
A BUNCH OF US ARE GOING
TO HANG OUT AT JUSTIN'S.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.768
SURE.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.838
OH WAIT! UH, WAIT.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.874
UH, JUSTIN'S HOUSE? THERE'S GONNA
BE SUPERVISION THERE, RIGHT?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.609
THERE'S GOING TO
BE ADULTS THERE.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.077
DEFINE "ADULTS."

10:44.111 --> 10:46.914
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE
WHO CAN BUY BEER.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.986
OKAY, AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
PARENTAL, WHERE ARE HIS PARENTS?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.788
JUSTIN DOESN'T NEED PARENTS.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.924
HE'S MATURE ENOUGH TO
HAVE HIS OWN PLACE.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.926
WELL, THEN HE'S TOO
MATURE FOR YOU.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.694
BUT I REALLY LIKE HIM.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.863
- OF COURSE YOU LIKE HIM. HE'S A...
- BAD BOY.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.332
YEAH, HE'S A BAD BOY...
HE'S COOL; HE'S DANGEROUS.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.001
LET ME TELL YOU, HE WON'T LOOK
SO COOL IN BETWEEN CONTRACTIONS

11:08.035 --> 11:10.838
- IN THE MATERNITY WARD.
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT'LL HAPPEN

11:10.871 --> 11:12.973
FROM ONE LITTLE PARTY STRAIGHT
TO THE DELIVERY ROOM.

11:13.006 --> 11:17.811
HEY, MAYBE ON THE WAY THERE, I CAN
ROB A BANK TO SUPPORT MY METH HABIT.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.314
SUDDENLY MY "C" IN SPANISH
DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.083
ZAPATOS.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.890
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE GOT A "C."

11:29.923 --> 11:33.160
HEY, I HANDLED THAT LENNOX THING
PRETTY WELL, DON'T YOU THINK?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.229
SURE. YEAH SURE.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.998
WHOA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SURE"?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.901
THERE'S A "BUT" COMING, ISN'T THERE?
I CAN SEE A "BUT" IN YOUR FACE.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.270
- YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
- YEAH I DO.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.272
I DON'T THINK YOU DO, BUT
I'M GONNA TELL YOU ANYWAY.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.107
LET'S JUST FORGET THE FACT
THAT YOU JUST CAME DOWN

11:47.140 --> 11:48.809
ON YOUR NIECE FOR
DATING A BAD BOY,

11:48.842 --> 11:51.011
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING
YOU'RE DOING. THAT'S IRRELEVANT.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.714
BESIDES THAT, I
JUST THINK THAT...

11:54.748 --> 11:58.118
YOU KNOW, YOU DESERVE A LOT BETTER.
THAT'S ALL.

12:01.354 --> 12:05.258
THAT WAS OUT OF LINE. I
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.860
I APOLOGIZE.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.768
I GOT NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.
I JUST FORGOT MY KEYS.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.771
ZAPATOS.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.715
WOW. I THOUGHT THE
RESTAURANT WAS GOOD.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.252
ELO'S IS AWESOME. MY
MANAGER RECOMMENDED IT.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.855
OH, YOU ALREADY HAVE A MANAGER?
EXCELLENT.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.356
YEAH WELL, RIGHT NOW
HE'S MY BARISTA.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.893
BUT AS SOON AS I HIT, I'M
TOTALLY MAKING HIM MY MANAGER.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.462
HEY, IT'S YOU.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.297
THAT'S MY ALBUM COVER.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.499
OH, WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE ALBUM?
MAYBE I'VE HEARD IT.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.871
IT ISN'T FINISHED YET. BUT IT
ALL STARTS WITH THE POSTER.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.006
AND THIS IS GONNA
BE MY FIRST SINGLE.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.811
♪ YOU AND YOUR EYES SO BRIGHT ♪

12:57.845 --> 12:59.947
♪ BRIGHT BRIGHT ♪

12:59.980 --> 13:03.516

LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT ♪

13:03.550 --> 13:05.485

13:05.518 --> 13:08.288

13:08.321 --> 13:11.959

13:11.992 --> 13:15.295

13:15.328 --> 13:17.230
OH, THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.468
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO FINISH 'CAUSE...

13:21.501 --> 13:22.769
'CAUSE WHAT?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.772
WELL, I HAVE A HARD TIME...

13:25.805 --> 13:27.540
- FINISHING STUFF?
- YEAH.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.778
UM, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE WERE IN A
BETTER PLACE WITH THE KISSING THING.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.914
ABSOLUTELY. LET'S
GET RIGHT ON THAT.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.421
OH! OH, I'M SORRY.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.557
OH NO, MY COMPLEX FILING SYSTEM.

13:44.591 --> 13:48.395
HEY, THESE ARE PARKING
TICKETS AND BILLS

13:48.428 --> 13:49.997
AND THEY'RE NOT OPENED.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.933
WHAT CAN I SAY? THEY'RE
ALL JUST SO DEPRESSING.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.136
MEL?

13:56.169 --> 14:00.540
THE ONLY THING I WANT TO PAY
RIGHT NOW IS ATTENTION...

14:00.573 --> 14:02.809
TO YOU.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.145
OKAY, THAT WAS CUTE.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.182
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE THREE
UNPAID PARKING VIOLATIONS,

14:09.216 --> 14:12.519
THE OHIO BUREAU OF MOTOR VEHICLES WILL
PUT A BLOCK ON YOUR REGISTRATION.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.887
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.822
I REGISTER MY BIKE
IN MY COUSIN'S NAME.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.590
THAT WAY I NEVER HAVE
TO DO JURY DUTY.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.526
DYLAN, OKAY, IF YOU'RE
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN...

14:19.559 --> 14:21.294
WHICH I AM. YEAH.
THREE YEARS NOW.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.830
"YANKEE DOODLE" AND ALL THAT.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.500
WELL, THEN SERVING ON A JURY IS ONE OF
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES.

14:27.534 --> 14:32.039
MMM, JURY DUTY. I DON'T THINK I
COULD SIT STILL FOR THAT LONG.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.874
OKAY LOOK, DYLAN, I LIKE YOU.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.610
YOU'RE VERY SWEET AND YOU
OBVIOUSLY WORK OUT A LOT.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.612
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST...

14:39.646 --> 14:42.615
I JUST DON'T SEE THIS
RELATIONSHIP GOING ANYWHERE.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.017
( sighs )

14:44.051 --> 14:48.355
WELL, YOU FINALLY
FINISHED ONE THING.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.866
ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S
WHAT I'VE GOT SO FAR...

14:59.899 --> 15:01.634
WE'VE GOT SNAG-PROOF
SWEATER STORAGE HERE;

15:01.668 --> 15:03.203
OFF-SEASON CLOTHING HERE;

15:03.236 --> 15:05.572
OH, AND I EVEN ROUGHED OUT A LITTLE
SECTION EXCLUSIVELY FOR YOUR UGGS.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.575
I DON'T KNOW HOW ONE PERSON WITH ONLY
TWO FEET COULD HAVE SO MANY UGGS,

15:08.608 --> 15:11.878
BUT REGARDLESS, IT'S
AN UGG-SPECIFIC ZONE.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.981
WELL, MY UGGS AND I THANK YOU.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.882
YOU KNOW, A CLOSET SAYS
A LOT ABOUT A PERSON.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.218
IT'S KIND OF A REFLECTION
OF ONE'S LIFE...

15:18.251 --> 15:21.254
YOU KNOW, LIKE, WHO YOU
CHOOSE AS A BOYFRIEND.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.524
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
ROUGH OUT A LITTLE SPACE

15:24.557 --> 15:26.559
FOR MY PERSONAL BOUNDARIES.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.296
YEAH SURE, OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE DOWN YOUR DRAWERS...

15:30.663 --> 15:33.066
AND PAINT THEM OUT
ON THE DRIVEWAY.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.635
LISTEN, ABOUT THE OTHER THING,

15:35.668 --> 15:38.571
UM, YOU KNOW, YOU
WERE KINDA RIGHT.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.641
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.610
ABOUT DYLAN... YOU WERE RIGHT.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.379
I WAS SUCKED IN BY ALL THE
BAD-BOY ACCOUTREMENTS, YOU KNOW?

15:46.413 --> 15:49.182
THE BODY, THE BIKE,
THE ACCENT, THE BODY.

15:49.216 --> 15:53.053
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE
WAS NOTHING THERE.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.554
SO I SAID GOODBYE.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.589
YOU CAME HOME AT 4:00 A.M.

15:56.623 --> 16:00.193
YEAH, IT WAS A LONG GOODBYE.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.695
YOU KNOW, 10 YEARS AGO, DYLAN
WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT FOR ME.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.132
BUT BY THE TIME YOU REACH 30, YOU
NEED A BETTER REASON TO DATE A GUY

16:05.165 --> 16:08.401
THAN, "DID YOU HEAR HIM TALK? HE
SOUNDS JUST LIKE DAVID BECKHAM."

16:09.402 --> 16:10.703
( door slams )

16:10.737 --> 16:12.372
OOH, ANGRY DOOR-SLAMMING.
LENNOX IS UP.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.974
HEY, LENNOX.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.146
HEY, LENNOX.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.481
OH GOD, WE AREN'T GOING
TO TALK, ARE WE?

16:21.514 --> 16:24.017
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE COMING
DOWN ON YOU SO HARD,

16:24.051 --> 16:25.952
BUT I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.221
I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SO EASY TO
FALL FOR A BAD BOY LIKE JUSTIN,

16:28.255 --> 16:31.291
BECAUSE AS IT TURNS
OUT, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW,

16:31.324 --> 16:33.160
I'VE BEEN DOING THE
VERY SAME THING.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.694
HERE'S MINE.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.964
WOW. HE'S HOT.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.366
DOES HE HAVE A FACE?

16:39.399 --> 16:41.668
OH SORRY.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.071
OH, NOT THAT ONE. OH NO.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.573
OH THERE. THERE, THAT'S DYLAN.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.042
MAN, HE'S SMOKIN'.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.711
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS
NOTHING BEYOND THAT.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.081
SO I ENDED IT.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.117
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY GOODBYE
TO SOMETHING THAT'S FUN AND DANGEROUS,

16:57.150 --> 17:00.753
BUT ULTIMATELY, THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS ARE JUST DEAD ENDS.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.555
DO YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.091
YEAH, I GET IT...

17:04.124 --> 17:07.727
BAD BOYS BAD; VIRGINITY GOOD.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.529
THAT'S IT.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.664
NOW JUST REPEAT THAT
UNTIL YOU'RE 30.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.572
( phone twittering )

17:19.606 --> 17:21.741
JUSTIN, HEY.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.610
YOU JUST DROPPED ME OFF.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.645
YEAH, I KNOW, I MISS YOU TOO.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.748
BUT DON'T BE CLINGY.
NOBODY LIKES THAT.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.784
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. MY AUNT'S
SOUND ASLEEP IN BED RIGHT NOW.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.755
OR STANDING RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.458
- ( phone beeps )
- WHERE DO WE START HERE, LENNOX?

17:38.491 --> 17:41.394
CURFEW VIOLATION,
BALD-FACED LYING?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.795
OH MY GOD, IS THAT MY SKIRT?

17:42.829 --> 17:44.764
YEAH, IT MAKES A
CUTE BELT, RIGHT?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.134
YEAH, I LIKE HOW YOU DID THAT WITH THE...
WAIT, STOP!

17:47.167 --> 17:49.336
LOOK, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
SNUCK OUT TO SEE JUSTIN

17:49.369 --> 17:51.304
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY
TOLD YOU NOT TO.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.506
- BUT AUNT MEL...
- DON'T "BUT AUNT MEL" ME!

17:53.540 --> 17:55.408
OH MY GOD, I SOUNDED LIKE
MY MOTHER JUST THEN.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.577
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE MORNING.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.180
GO. GO GO.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.552
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.288
GO GO. WAIT.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.693
WELL, LOOK WHO'S BACK.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.828
- ALL RIGHT, JOE?
- DYLAN.

18:15.862 --> 18:19.199
AH, HE WAS JUST LEAVING. I...
I MEANT TO TELL HIM GOODBYE.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.600
I MEAN, I REALLY MEANT
TO TELL HIM GOODBYE,

18:20.633 --> 18:22.569
BUT SOMEHOW GOODBYE TURNED
INTO "HEY, COME OVER."

18:22.602 --> 18:25.071
SO ANYWAY, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TELL HIM GOODBYE AGAIN.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.140
THIS IS GOODBYE?

18:27.174 --> 18:30.543
YEAH. LOOK, DYLAN, I THINK
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

18:30.577 --> 18:32.179
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.147
OH, THIS SPEECH AGAIN.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.715
THIS TIME I MEAN IT.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.151
HEY, AUNT MEL, HERE'S YOUR...

18:38.185 --> 18:42.289
- WELL, HELLO.
- HOW YOU DOIN'?

18:42.322 --> 18:47.160
HAVE YOU MET MY FRIEND DYLAN...
McLOVIN'?

18:47.194 --> 18:50.730
OH YEAH, I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
YOU WITH YOUR SHIRT ON.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.132
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S LATE.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.469
AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE
TO JUST GO TO BED... ALONE.

18:56.503 --> 19:00.507
AND THINK VERY HARD ABOUT THE EVENTS
THAT HAVE TRANSPIRED HERE TODAY

19:00.540 --> 19:02.509
AND THEN FORGET ABOUT
THEM ENTIRELY.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.478
HEY MEL, CALL ME IF YOU EVER
WANT TO SAY GOODBYE AGAIN.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.651
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.655
YOU TELL ME THAT BOY BOYS ARE OFF LIMITS,
YET YOU'RE HIDING ONE IN YOUR BEDROOM?

19:15.688 --> 19:18.725
IT'S GOING SO GREAT.
JUST BRING IT HOME.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.527
OKAY... OKAY,
HERE'S THE THING...

19:20.560 --> 19:22.462
THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.532
I CAN DO THINGS AT 32 THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T DO AT 15.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.367
I KNOW BECAUSE I DID THEM.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.835
YOU SAW MY CLOTHES.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.239
THAT'S NOT FAIR. HOW COME
I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.140
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOU TO GET HURT.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.443
THE ONLY REASON I DID THOSE
THINGS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE

19:36.476 --> 19:39.579
WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND
WHO CARED ENOUGH TO TELL ME NO.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.249
OH! YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.584
AND I'M KEEPING YOUR SKIRT.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.557
SHE'S VERY UNHAPPY WITH YOU.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.692
- ( door slams )
- WELL, THAT'S THE JOB, RIGHT?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.794
IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.663
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.532
- BUT, UM...
- THERE'S ALWAYS A "BUT" WITH YOU.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.701
NO, IT'S JUST THAT

20:01.734 --> 20:03.836
YOU SAID YOU WERE THROUGH
WITH THE BAD BOYS.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.307
I AM. I MEAN, I TOTALLY
GET IT UP HERE.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.776
IT'S JUST TAKING A WHILE
TO WORK ITS WAY DOWN.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.345
'NIGHT.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.614
GOOD NIGHT.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.285
- HEY, JOE?
- YES?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.389
THANKS FOR TELLING ME NO.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.558
ANYTIME.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.805
JOE, IT'S AMAZING.
I MEAN, THANK YOU.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.773
I COULD NEVER HAVE
DONE THIS BY MYSELF.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.476
OBVIOUSLY. OH, AND
CHECK OUT THIS.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.312
YOU READY?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.880
YEAH, BABY.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.417
- MY BAGS!
- YEP.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.419
AND THEY ARE IN RAINBOW ORDER.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.655
OH, THAT IS SO OBSESSIVELY

20:55.688 --> 20:58.691
COMPULSIVELY WONDERFUL.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.660
OH, AND ONE LAST THING.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.429
HERE YOU GO.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.598
WHAT IS THIS? MY OLD CLOTHES!

21:05.632 --> 21:07.767
MY FAVORITES. YOU
DIDN'T THROW THEM OUT.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.370
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE SAYING THERE'S
NONE OF THAT WILD PARTY GIRL LEFT.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.805
SO I MANAGED TO FIT ALL YOUR ADULT
RESPONSIBLE CLOTHING IN HERE

21:12.839 --> 21:15.775
AND STILL KEEP SOME OF
THOSE TRASHY THINGS

21:15.808 --> 21:18.578
THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER
WEAR AGAIN IN PUBLIC.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.780
I CAN WEAR THIS AGAIN.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.715
NO.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.916
WELL...

21:23.950 --> 21:27.654
OH, THIS IS WHAT I
WORE TO MY PROM.

21:27.687 --> 21:31.591
OH, STILL SMELLS LIKE WHISKEY SOURS, C.K.
ONE AND A BARN FLOOR.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.861
WELL, OUR PROM THEME WAS
"NIGHT AT THE RODEO."

21:34.894 --> 21:37.897
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE NOT GONNA THROW
THIS OUT; WE'RE GONNA BURY THIS.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.738
