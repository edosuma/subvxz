00:00.033 --> 00:02.367
-You were planning a wedding?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.567
You paid her nothing?

00:05.700 --> 00:08.200
"How dare you call me
before my wedding

00:08.266 --> 00:10.133
asking me for money,"
is what she said.

00:11.367 --> 00:12.667
And hung up in my face.

00:12.734 --> 00:15.166
She was a stressed bridezilla.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.233
Exactly.

All rise.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.800
Have a seat, please.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.433
Good morning, Judge.
We have case number 1025,

00:51.500 --> 00:52.567
Jones versus Fields.

00:52.633 --> 00:53.567
Thank you.

00:53.633 --> 00:54.633
You're welcome.

00:55.734 --> 00:58.266
Ms. Fields, I'm going to
start with you in this case.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.533
You were planning a wedding?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.667
-Yes, ma'am.
-On what date was the wedding?

01:01.734 --> 01:02.700
Sunday, May 30th.

01:02.767 --> 01:03.834
[Judy] Did it take place?

01:03.900 --> 01:04.800
Yes, ma'am.

01:04.867 --> 01:05.834
Is this your husband?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.200
-[Fields] Yes, ma'am.
-Are you happy?

01:07.266 --> 01:09.033
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.767
Good. Both look very happy.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.734
-[Fields] Two months tomorrow.
-[Judy] Two.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.734
Well, keep counting them
that way with this smile.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.000
Yes, ma'am.

01:17.066 --> 01:18.367
[Judy] And you had
a pretty good wedding day.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.433
-Amazing.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.066
Great. When you were
planning the wedding,

01:21.133 --> 01:24.033
according to what I read in
the complaint and your answer,

01:24.100 --> 01:26.600
you were looking for someone to
do the makeup for your wedding.

01:26.667 --> 01:27.600
Yes, ma'am.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.033
[Judy] And you did a search
and you found someone

01:30.100 --> 01:32.233
who came recommended,
and that was the plaintiff.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.233
[Erica] Yes.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.900
And on what date did you
make an appointment to see her?

01:35.967 --> 01:37.300
Well, actually
before that, Your Honor,

01:37.367 --> 01:40.633
I had a phone consultation with her
on Friday, April 23rd.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.433
Okay, and you made
an appointment to see her.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.033
The first appointment
was Sunday, two days later,

01:45.100 --> 01:46.133
the 25th of April.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.300
Okay. And you went
to her place of business.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.066
Was it a studio or her home?

01:50.133 --> 01:51.066
A studio.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.834
[Judy] In the phone conversation
that you had with her

01:52.900 --> 01:55.000
on the 23rd, did you get a quote

01:55.066 --> 01:58.000
for what her services
would be in total?

01:58.066 --> 02:00.333
Yes, ma'am.
So, the verbal quote was up to,

02:00.400 --> 02:02.300
it was for myself on site,

02:02.367 --> 02:04.934
and up to four bridesmaids.
I only needed three.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.867
And how much was that?

02:05.934 --> 02:07.300
Six hundred seventy-five dollars.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.033
And I do have a copy
of that quote.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.033
[Judy] I'm going to get to that

02:10.100 --> 02:11.033
-in a minute.
-Yes, ma'am.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.600
And after you left the studio,
where did you go?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.400
To have engagement photos done.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.533
How long did that take?

02:15.600 --> 02:18.567
The engagement photos?
[laughs] Forever.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.834
Yeah, for about
five or six hours,

02:20.900 --> 02:23.133
we were being photographed
at multiple locations.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.266
Okay, so it would be
fair to say, Ms. Fields,

02:26.333 --> 02:29.100
you had your makeup
done on a Sunday,

02:29.166 --> 02:31.400
which is not
a regular work day.

02:31.467 --> 02:32.967
-Yeah.
-And you had

02:33.033 --> 02:35.467
your makeup done on that Sunday

02:35.533 --> 02:38.033
in order to take
your engagement photos?

02:38.100 --> 02:39.166
-Um...
-That--

02:39.233 --> 02:41.633
-There's no equivocation there.
-Okay.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.633
[Judy] When one takes
engagement photos--

02:43.700 --> 02:45.000
I've been through enough weddings

02:45.066 --> 02:48.400
of my children
and grandchildren to know

02:48.467 --> 02:50.333
that when you take
engagement photos,

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
you get your makeup done.

02:51.467 --> 02:54.000
I wasn't planning to.
I don't wear makeup typically.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.934
[Judy] Well, whether
you plan to typically,

02:56.000 --> 02:57.266
it is too serendipitous

02:57.333 --> 03:00.600
that out of 365 days a year--

03:00.667 --> 03:02.233
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] --that the one day

03:02.300 --> 03:03.667
that you had your test makeup,

03:03.734 --> 03:05.900
you also had
a very long photoshoot

03:05.967 --> 03:08.900
for your engagement party
at multiple locations.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.166
-Yes.
-I can't get that

03:10.233 --> 03:11.166
through my head,

03:11.233 --> 03:13.867
that that was serendipitous
and unplanned by you.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.333
Yes, ma'am.
I did. I apologize.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.066
Right. And now,
I'd like to see from you,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.266
Ms. Jones,
a copy of the contract.

03:23.266 --> 03:26.533
So here is the proposal
and the contract.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.734
[Judy] And can you give me
some idea, Ms. Jones,

03:39.800 --> 03:42.533
of how long the makeup application took?

03:42.600 --> 03:43.767
It usually only takes
like 45 minutes,

03:43.834 --> 03:45.900
but it was during conversation,
so it was a little bit longer.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.700
It was like an hour
and maybe 15 minutes.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.033
Do you remember what time
Ms. Fields got there?

03:50.100 --> 03:51.667
No, I don't remember
exactly what time.

03:51.734 --> 03:52.700
-Her appointment was--
-[Judy] Do you remember

03:52.767 --> 03:54.767
-what time you got there?
-We were supposed to be there,

03:54.834 --> 03:56.900
if I'm not mistaken, at noon.
And I got there--

03:56.967 --> 03:58.867
I text her and told her
I was a few minutes late.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.467
She said it was fine.
I got there.

04:00.533 --> 04:01.900
-[Judy] Okay.
-She was waiting for me.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.934
Were you wearing the clothes
you were going to wear

04:04.000 --> 04:05.367
at the engagement photos?

04:05.433 --> 04:07.300
-No, ma'am.
-Then you had to go home to--

04:07.367 --> 04:09.367
and change in order to get
the engagement photos?

04:09.433 --> 04:10.433
Yes, ma'am.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.367
-What?
-[Jones] No,

04:11.433 --> 04:13.000
she had the clothes on.
She left my studio,

04:13.066 --> 04:14.600
-went straight to the site.
-[Erica] No, ma'am.

04:14.667 --> 04:15.700
-What was she wearing?
-[Erica] I have pictures of

04:15.767 --> 04:17.133
-my engagement photos.
-So, here is the photo

04:17.200 --> 04:18.266
-that she had on.
-[Judy] I'd like to see.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.800
-[Jones] It was-- yeah.
-I'd like to see it.

04:19.867 --> 04:20.900
[Jones] Mm-hmm.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.467
And she also made it
her profile picture.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.834
[Judy] Okay, just a second.
Ms. Fields?

04:30.900 --> 04:31.867
Yes, ma'am.

04:31.934 --> 04:33.133
This is your husband?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.300
-[Erica] Yes.
-[Judy] Do you remember

04:34.367 --> 04:35.333
what color shirt

04:35.400 --> 04:37.433
you were wearing
for the engagement photos?

04:37.500 --> 04:41.000
-Uh, yes, ma'am.
-It was... I'm sorry.

04:41.066 --> 04:42.200
Yes, ma'am.
It was, uh, red.

04:42.266 --> 04:43.467
-[Judy] It was red.
-Yes, ma'am.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.300
And your wife
was wearing polka dot dress

04:46.367 --> 04:48.066
with red, big red rose.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.066
Yes, ma'am.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.033
So, those were
the engagement photo.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.266
-Mm-hmm.
-That's what you were wearing.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.734
Well, you were wearing
that to the studio?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.166
[Erica] No, ma'am.
I left church.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.700
I came to her
in a black one-piece unit,

04:57.767 --> 04:58.734
similar to what she's wearing.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.066
And that's the picture
I sent her

05:00.133 --> 05:01.967
-from the engagement photos.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:02.033 --> 05:02.967
That's not what I was wearing.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.500
This is not what
she was wearing, she said,

05:04.567 --> 05:05.633
-[Erica] No.
-when she came to your studio?

05:05.700 --> 05:06.900
-That is what she was wearing.
-No, I have a picture.

05:06.967 --> 05:08.633
Okay.
Can I see your photo, please?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.367
Yes, ma'am. Unfortunately,
it's in my phone

05:10.433 --> 05:11.834
because I didn't know
it would be privy,

05:11.900 --> 05:13.500
but this is
when I left her studio.

05:13.567 --> 05:14.800
That was in her parking lot.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.066
Okay, great.
I'll just take a quick look.

05:20.633 --> 05:21.633
-[Erica] No rose.
-[Judy] Oh, my goodness,

05:21.700 --> 05:22.633
those are some lashes.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.633
-[Erica] Yeah.
-[inhales sharply]

05:23.700 --> 05:24.633
[audience laughs]

05:24.700 --> 05:27.066
Can I get some of those?

05:27.133 --> 05:28.467
[Erica] Thank you, sir.

05:28.533 --> 05:31.700
[Judy] Okay. I'm reading
this initial retainer,

05:31.767 --> 05:33.967
and Sarah's viewing the contract

05:34.033 --> 05:35.700
'cause I'm gonna look at it
in a second.

05:35.767 --> 05:39.367
It says that when you left,
you were supposed to give her

05:39.433 --> 05:41.200
a retainer of 300 dollars

05:41.266 --> 05:42.300
if you signed the contract.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.100
-Yes.
-Did you give it to her?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.767
Uh, it was verbally agreed,
and I have--

05:45.834 --> 05:46.734
[Judy] No, no, no.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.734
-That's not what I asked.
-I'm sorry.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.834
-No, I did not.
-Did you give her any money?

05:49.900 --> 05:51.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] How much money

05:51.166 --> 05:53.300
-did you give her?
-Thirty dollars cash for a tip.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.767
-[Judy] As a tip?
-Yes.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.467
[Judy] So, other than the tip,
you didn't give her any money?

05:57.533 --> 05:58.467
No, ma'am.

05:58.533 --> 05:59.367
But you did sign the contract.

05:59.433 --> 06:02.133
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Did the contract provide

06:02.200 --> 06:04.667
that at the time
of signing of the contract,

06:04.734 --> 06:07.133
you were supposed
to give her the deposit?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.934
[Erica] No, ma'am.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.333
It just says May 21st
was the entire amount was due.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.967
There's no deposit date.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.066
That's correct.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.233
Okay, well,
it's a little confusing.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.867
It says that the deposit
must be paid in advance.

06:24.934 --> 06:27.800
Well, advance can be a day
in advance or two days in advance.

06:27.867 --> 06:31.000
But there is,
according to the contract,

06:31.066 --> 06:33.734
a 300-dollar deposit
that's due in advance.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.567
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] That's non-refundable.

06:35.633 --> 06:36.967
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Did you pay her

06:37.033 --> 06:38.867
-the 300 dollars?
-No, ma'am.

06:38.934 --> 06:40.066
Now tell me why not?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.367
We had a verbal agreement

06:41.433 --> 06:43.533
and later confirmed
by her in writing,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.734
that May 7th was when
the deposit would be due.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.133
Okay. Did you ask her
because you confirmed,

06:49.200 --> 06:50.300
and you signed this contract?

06:50.367 --> 06:51.233
Yes, ma'am.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.266
[Judy] This is my question.
She does your makeup.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.767
-Yes.
-She shows you the contract.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.200
-Yes.
-[Judy] You say that's fine,

06:56.266 --> 06:57.900
because we've already
agreed upon the price.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.433
-Yes, ma'am.
-She needs a deposit

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
-to hold the date.
-[Erica] Yes.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.834
I want you to understand
how that usually works.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.200
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] If you're going to

07:04.266 --> 07:05.433
hold the date,

07:05.500 --> 07:07.200
you say I'm going
to sign the contract

07:07.266 --> 07:10.533
and give you a deposit,
the same day, that's what happens.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.133
When you-you took
a wedding venue,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.633
that's what usually happens
when you take a wedding venue.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.567
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-You go, you sign the contract.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.033
On the day you sign
the contract,

07:19.100 --> 07:21.633
you give them a deposit.
I assume that's what you did.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.266
Um, the wedding venue was paid
in full the day we visited.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.066
Okay, but it was paid well before.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.300
-Yes.
-But usually

07:27.367 --> 07:28.867
-you give someone a deposit.
-[Erica] Yes.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.500
And they hold the date,

07:30.567 --> 07:32.233
because this is
a service business.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.100
It's a service venue,
it's a service, makeup artist.

07:35.166 --> 07:40.767
So the 7th of May,
the delay in giving her a deposit

07:40.834 --> 07:45.200
for sure had to be
because you asked for it.

07:45.266 --> 07:46.934
She never gave me a date
for the deposits,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.367
so that's why I asked if I could
just pay it on the 7th.

07:49.433 --> 07:52.500
Well, because you seem
like an intelligent woman.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.600
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-The contract says

07:54.667 --> 07:56.867
that the deposit
must be paid in advance.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.867
-Yes.
-[Judy] By the way,

07:57.934 --> 08:00.433
you should change the contract

08:00.500 --> 08:04.000
by saying the deposit
must be paid

08:04.066 --> 08:06.000
at the time of
signing the contract.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.600
-After this, I have.
-Yes, ma'am.

08:07.667 --> 08:08.867
-[Judy] You did?
-Yes, ma'am.

08:08.934 --> 08:11.567
[Judy] Okay, so you understand
that there was...

08:11.633 --> 08:12.767
[Jones] It's a little shaky, a little.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.200
It's a little shaky.

08:14.266 --> 08:15.934
-Yes.
-Because certainly

08:16.000 --> 08:20.467
she wasn't doing your makeup,
even yours for a tip.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.233
-I agree.
-So, at minimum,

08:23.300 --> 08:26.066
you know
that you owe her the deposit.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.000
-Yes.
-[Judy] At minimum.

08:27.066 --> 08:29.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] So, ultimately,

08:29.166 --> 08:30.533
you breached the contract,

08:30.600 --> 08:33.467
and you breached the contract
by canceling her service.

08:33.533 --> 08:36.467
-She canceled.
-Well, I read your answer.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.767
You tell me in your words

08:37.834 --> 08:39.667
what you want me
to believe happened.

08:39.734 --> 08:42.233
So, when we spoke
over the phone and in studio,

08:42.300 --> 08:43.700
we did verbally agree

08:43.767 --> 08:44.967
that I would pay the deposit May 7th.

08:45.033 --> 08:47.233
She didn't have a definite date
that she wanted it paid. But I--

08:47.300 --> 08:49.433
No, no, no, no.
You understand what I mean.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.734
-[Erica] Okay.
-Ms. Fields,

08:50.800 --> 08:52.767
you're supposed to pay
the deposit

08:52.834 --> 08:55.233
the day you sign the contract.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.033
She didn't issue me
an invoice till May 1st.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.667
See, it's not an invoice.
Uncross your arms.

08:59.734 --> 09:01.100
Don't get angry.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.734
So far, it looks like you're
ahead of the game, right?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.033
Yeah.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.033
You should have
paid the deposit

09:08.100 --> 09:10.266
at the time
you signed the contract.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.900
You knew that it said
300-dollar deposit.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.767
The 375 was paid
on the day of the wedding.

09:15.834 --> 09:16.667
You knew that.

09:16.734 --> 09:19.300
And you knew that, sir,
'cause you came with her, right?

09:19.367 --> 09:20.300
Yes, ma'am.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.533
[Judy] Did you have
any money with you?

09:21.600 --> 09:23.500
-Uh, yes, ma'am.
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.967
[Judy] Well, if you
had money with you,

09:25.033 --> 09:26.834
why didn't you give her a deposit

09:26.900 --> 09:28.133
when you signed the contract?

09:28.200 --> 09:31.467
Then all you had to do
was do $375

09:31.533 --> 09:32.567
on the date of the wedding.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.834
Finished.
You used the makeup.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.633
You went and did
your engagement pictures

09:36.700 --> 09:39.767
using her service,
and didn't pay her anything.

09:39.834 --> 09:43.300
So, at minimum,
you owed her for her service.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.133
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Which is one hour,

09:45.200 --> 09:49.734
and that charge
was minimally 300 dollars

09:49.800 --> 09:54.100
because she was going to do you
and up to four bridesmaids

09:54.166 --> 09:56.200
for another $375.

09:56.266 --> 09:57.433
I mean, if you think about it,

09:57.500 --> 09:59.934
because that's what
the package included.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.900
Okay. So now, why don't you
tell me the story

10:03.967 --> 10:04.900
that you're going to tell me

10:04.967 --> 10:07.600
about how she breached
the contract?

10:07.667 --> 10:09.734
So, May 3rd, I was at work,

10:09.800 --> 10:12.333
and I received a phone call
from Donyale, out of the blue,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.734
uninitiated by myself,
and she told me

10:14.800 --> 10:16.834
that she had other
business opportunities

10:16.900 --> 10:19.367
for the same day as my wedding
that were willing to pay

10:19.433 --> 10:21.900
before our agreed-upon
deposit due date,

10:21.967 --> 10:23.567
and that she wanted me
to pay her

10:23.633 --> 10:25.000
in advance of our agreement.

10:25.066 --> 10:26.600
And I told her
that I didn't have it.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.400
To be honest,
I got paid that Friday and--

10:28.467 --> 10:29.567
He said he had money.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.300
I didn't ask him for it.
He wasn't my husband yet.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.600
Just a second.
Now you can sit down.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.734
He said he had money.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.734
Yes, ma'am.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.467
[whispers] Over there. Perfect. Perfect.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.667
[theme music]

10:43.734 --> 10:45.433
You're hollering
to the top of your lungs

10:45.500 --> 10:46.934
and I'm like, hold up,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.133
I didn't call you for all this.
So, I just became quiet.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.300
I let her vent, and at that--

10:50.367 --> 10:52.400
She was a stressed bridezilla...

10:52.467 --> 10:54.133
-[Jones] Exactly.
-is what you're describing.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.166
Exactly. And I just let her be

10:56.233 --> 10:58.033
because sometimes
you just need to get it out.

11:03.266 --> 11:05.266
[theme music]

11:09.400 --> 11:11.233
[narrator]
<i>Makeup Artist Donyale Jones</i>

11:11.300 --> 11:14.633
<i>claims Erica Fields</i>
<i>refused to pay for services.</i>

11:14.700 --> 11:18.934
<i>Erica is countersuing Donyale</i>
<i>for making false accusations.</i>

11:19.000 --> 11:21.333
So, she wanted
her money before?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.367
[Erica] Yes, on the 3rd.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.533
And you said to her?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.767
I will pay you on Friday
based on our agreement.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.100
The 7th. And she decided
to cancel because--

11:29.166 --> 11:32.233
No, not she decided.
What did she say to you?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.734
She said that she needed me

11:33.800 --> 11:35.200
to pay her
of what I was going to do.

11:35.266 --> 11:36.767
And I said,
"I don't, I'm at work.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.300
And I can't really have
this conversation right now."

11:39.367 --> 11:41.633
I said, "If you feel the need
to take the other business

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
because they can pay early,

11:42.767 --> 11:44.667
go ahead and take
the other business."

11:44.734 --> 11:46.000
She canceled the contract
and said--

11:46.066 --> 11:49.033
Did not cancel the contract.
What did she say?

11:49.100 --> 11:50.834
She did say
that she was going to bill me

11:50.900 --> 11:52.667
for the trial service
for 80 dollars.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.367
And I received that invoice.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.266
Okay. Now, why did you
call her on the 3rd?

11:57.333 --> 11:58.934
Because it had
gotten to that point.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.600
And I did get a phone call
from one of my facial clients

12:01.667 --> 12:03.200
that wanted to book that Sunday.

12:03.266 --> 12:05.133
So, either I was going
to put them on a Saturday,

12:05.200 --> 12:06.333
or I was going to put them
on a Sunday,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.600
but I wanted to make sure

12:07.667 --> 12:10.133
that she was paying me
my money on that Friday.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.700
Okay, because that's what
you had agreed to,

12:12.767 --> 12:14.166
-to accept the deposit on Friday.
-Yeah, I did.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.200
Yeah, I did.
I did agree to that.

12:16.266 --> 12:17.500
-[Judy] Okay.
-She said she had just

12:17.567 --> 12:18.767
paid the venue all this money.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.734
So I did. And we had just
came out of COVID.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.233
So, I mean, I have a soft heart.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.266
Okay, so you had agreed
on the 7th,

12:24.333 --> 12:26.633
you called her on the 3rd
and you said,

12:26.700 --> 12:28.333
"I want to make sure
you're going to do this booking

12:28.400 --> 12:29.934
because I have
another opportunity."

12:30.000 --> 12:31.800
I couldn't even
get the sentence out

12:31.867 --> 12:33.133
before she went AWOL.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.633
I couldn't even finish
the sentence. So, she--

12:35.700 --> 12:38.367
No, when you say she went AWOL,
that's a conclusion.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.567
I want you to tell me
what she said.

12:40.633 --> 12:43.033
Oh! "How dare you
call me on the 3rd?

12:43.100 --> 12:45.400
This is 27 days
before my wedding

12:45.467 --> 12:47.600
asking me for money,"
is what she said.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.600
[Judy] And what did you say?

12:48.667 --> 12:50.734
[Jones] I couldn't say nothing
because she kept going.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.834
And I just became quiet

12:51.900 --> 12:54.266
because you're hollering
to the top of your lungs.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.967
And I'm like, hold up.
I didn't call you for all this.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.867
So, I just became quiet.
I let her vent.

12:58.934 --> 13:00.800
She went venting
for about ten minutes

13:00.867 --> 13:03.734
about other vendors and other
things that were going on

13:03.800 --> 13:05.633
that had nothing to do with me.
And at that--

13:05.700 --> 13:07.800
She was a stressed bridezilla...

13:07.867 --> 13:09.600
-[Jones] Exactly.
-is what you are describing.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.834
Exactly. And I just let her vent

13:11.900 --> 13:13.233
because sometimes
you just need to get it out.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.967
So, I let her vent,
didn't say nothing.

13:15.033 --> 13:17.567
And at that point, I was
thinking in my mind, I'm like,

13:17.633 --> 13:20.200
"This lady probably is not
going to pay me my money."

13:20.266 --> 13:22.066
And in the conversation,
she said,

13:22.133 --> 13:24.200
"Just cancel my contract,
just cancel.

13:24.266 --> 13:25.967
I'll find somebody else,
just cancel it."

13:26.033 --> 13:27.734
I said, "Is that,
if that's what you want,

13:27.800 --> 13:29.867
I will surely do that."
"Yes."

13:29.934 --> 13:32.066
I said, "Okay. Well,
I will still be billing you

13:32.133 --> 13:33.633
for the services
that I did do,

13:33.700 --> 13:34.734
which is the 80 dollars."

13:34.800 --> 13:37.500
I did say that,
and she said, "Okay, fine,"

13:37.567 --> 13:38.734
and hung up in my face.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.667
Okay. Did you bill her
for the 80?

13:40.734 --> 13:41.700
I did.

13:41.767 --> 13:42.700
[Judy] Did she pay you?

13:42.767 --> 13:44.834
Nope. She looked
at all the invoices.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.500
Okay. Just a second.

13:46.567 --> 13:48.500
Now, Ms. Fields,
we're gonna come back to you.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.200
Yes. Yes, ma'am. I was at work.

13:50.266 --> 13:53.066
Just a second.
I don't give a rat's behind

13:53.133 --> 13:55.834
where you were
and how stressed you were.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.433
I actually believe her.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.433
I didn't go off on her.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.533
[Judy] Just a second.
I actually believe her.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.500
-[Erica] Okay.
-[Judy] Yeah.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.533
-You know why I believe her?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.400
It all sounds very reasonable.
I mean, I'm visualizing this.

14:07.467 --> 14:09.800
You signed a contract,
you didn't pay.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.200
He had the money.

14:11.266 --> 14:14.734
And he was with you
in his red shirt and jacket,

14:14.800 --> 14:17.033
but he didn't pay the deposit.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.667
You agreed,
which is perfectly fine,

14:19.734 --> 14:22.100
that you would pay her
on the 7th.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.133
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-So, you saw her

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
on April 25th, and you said,

14:25.266 --> 14:26.834
"I will pay you on May 7th."

14:26.900 --> 14:28.467
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Or before.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.133
I mean, you certainly
could pay her before.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.200
You didn't.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.600
She gets a call from
another one of her clients

14:33.667 --> 14:36.333
who say, "I'd like to book you
on the same day as the wedding,"

14:36.400 --> 14:38.867
which was May 30th.

14:38.934 --> 14:42.767
And whatever the conversation
was, she said to you,

14:42.834 --> 14:45.500
"Okay, we're probably
not a good fit."

14:45.567 --> 14:47.700
She was prepared
to cancel the contract,

14:47.767 --> 14:48.800
which you would sign.

14:48.867 --> 14:49.934
-[Erica] Yes.
-She said,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.700
"Just pay me
my 80 dollars for the makeup,"

14:53.767 --> 14:57.700
which is a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.467
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Eighty dollars.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.233
You said fine and hung up.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.000
You didn't send her
the 80 dollars.

15:03.066 --> 15:04.567
-No.
-You did, in fact,

15:04.633 --> 15:06.400
report her
to the Better Business Bureau.

15:06.467 --> 15:08.400
-[Erica] And others.
-Why?

15:08.467 --> 15:10.967
Because she continued
to call me at work.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.734
To ask for her 80 dollars.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.767
Um, it goes deeper
than that, Your Honor.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.266
Well, how much deeper?
This is the lady you never met.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.467
-Exactly.
-[Judy] This is a lady

15:18.533 --> 15:19.467
you've never met.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.133
So, how could it go deeper?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.834
It's not as if
you shared a boyfriend,

15:22.900 --> 15:23.967
you shared an ex-somebody.

15:24.033 --> 15:25.000
We share an acquaintance

15:25.066 --> 15:26.900
that I didn't know
that we shared.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.700
What difference
does that make?

15:28.767 --> 15:32.000
The acquaintance has been
kind of sort of after me.

15:32.066 --> 15:36.800
And I have now taken matters up
with that acquaintance

15:36.867 --> 15:38.533
and this is some, the person

15:38.600 --> 15:40.533
that's whose makeup
she did on the 30th.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.734
[Judy]
Okay, so she told the story

15:42.800 --> 15:45.800
that you had a service,
you didn't pay for it?

15:45.867 --> 15:47.000
Yes, ma'am.

15:47.066 --> 15:48.300
[Judy] Because
she sent you an invoice

15:48.367 --> 15:50.066
and what you should have done
was pay the invoice.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.033
-Okay.
-[Judy] Okay.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.100
And you got the invoice.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.600
There's no question about that.

15:53.667 --> 15:54.600
-And you ignored it.
-Yes, ma'am. I did.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.967
[Judy] Okay.
And what I care about is

15:57.033 --> 15:58.900
why you didn't pay
the 80 dollars.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.600
Why should she work for you
for nothing?

16:01.667 --> 16:04.834
You take the benefit
of her expertise

16:04.900 --> 16:07.867
and use it to take
all of your engagement photos.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.367
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-Which was pre-planned,

16:09.433 --> 16:13.200
and then not use her
as per the contract.

16:13.266 --> 16:16.000
I don't understand why you think
you don't owe her

16:16.066 --> 16:18.667
at least what you agreed to,
which was the 80 bucks.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.367
I never agreed
to the 80 dollars.

16:20.433 --> 16:21.633
-That's not true.
-[Judy] Well, well--

16:21.700 --> 16:23.533
did you think she was going
to do your makeup for free?

16:23.600 --> 16:26.033
I did not, Your Honor,
and just-- I agree with you.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.700
If she hadn't agreed
to the 80 dollars,

16:27.767 --> 16:29.700
you would have been stuck
with the contract.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.967
-Yes, ma'am. I understand.
-Which is a lot more.

16:32.033 --> 16:32.967
I understand now.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.300
-Do you?
-[Erica] I do now.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.300
I mean, when you explain it,
yes, ma'am, I do.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.367
I apologize. I do.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.433
Okay, because her lawsuit now

16:39.500 --> 16:42.066
is much more than just
the 80 dollars.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.233
-[Erica] Yes, ma'am.
-Because

16:43.300 --> 16:46.533
she says that you
maliciously filed reports

16:46.600 --> 16:49.800
to the regulatory institutions
that regulate her business.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.867
[Erica] Yes.
Now I would like to see,

16:51.934 --> 16:54.600
please, the report that
she filed and what happened.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.233
-[Jones] Okay.
-[Judy] As there are two parts.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.567
[Jones] So, the BBB.
That's this one,

16:58.633 --> 17:01.000
it's her response at the bottom
and mine at the top,

17:01.066 --> 17:03.333
and it's still open
because we're here.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.900
And then the second one
is with TDLR,

17:06.967 --> 17:09.467
which is Texas Department
of Licensing and Regulation,

17:09.533 --> 17:12.467
which is where I host
my aesthetician license under.

17:12.533 --> 17:13.500
Can I see those?

17:13.567 --> 17:15.233
Where she opened
an investigation with that.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
[Judy] Thank you.

17:23.734 --> 17:25.433
Well, I'm reading
your complaint.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.333
[Erica] Yes, ma'am.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.033
[Judy] And your complaint
is a little disingenuous,

17:30.100 --> 17:34.266
because what you say here is,
"She canceled the contract,

17:34.333 --> 17:37.734
and she sent me a bill
for an 80-dollar trial run."

17:37.800 --> 17:40.000
-[Erica] Yes.
-[Judy] "She chose to dishonor

17:40.066 --> 17:42.467
her signed contract and cancel."

17:42.533 --> 17:44.100
Which I don't think
happened at all.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.600
I think that she agreed
to cancel the contract.

17:46.667 --> 17:47.967
Otherwise,
you would be responsible

17:48.033 --> 17:49.700
for the whole contract.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.333
You would be responsible.
There's no question.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.467
You have a signed deal.

17:52.533 --> 17:53.900
I didn't ask her
to cancel, Your Honor.

17:53.967 --> 17:54.867
[Judy] No, no, no, no.

17:54.934 --> 17:57.066
I know
what the conversation was.

17:57.133 --> 18:00.467
I actually do know,
like I could hear it,

18:00.533 --> 18:04.066
like there was stress
and if you had said to her,

18:04.133 --> 18:06.700
"I'm absolutely going to
pay you on the 7th."

18:06.767 --> 18:07.767
That's three more days...

18:07.834 --> 18:09.066
-[Erica] I did.
-Four more days.

18:09.133 --> 18:10.233
No way.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.900
She asked me
to pay her that day.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.567
She said she needed me
to pay her that day

18:13.633 --> 18:15.467
because the other person
was willing to pay that day

18:15.533 --> 18:17.200
and I told her I couldn't
until the 7th

18:17.266 --> 18:19.367
and she said, "Then I'm gonna
have to cancel your contract

18:19.433 --> 18:20.400
because I'm asking you to pay."

18:20.467 --> 18:21.400
Is that what happened?

18:21.467 --> 18:23.200
Absolutely not.
It's a facial client.

18:23.266 --> 18:24.867
I could have easily moved them
to a Saturday.

18:24.934 --> 18:27.333
You're a wedding,
that's an all-day service.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.333
Yeah.
It didn't happen that way.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.433
-[Erica] The makeup she did--
-Ms. Fields,

18:30.500 --> 18:31.467
-it didn't happen that way.
-Was for a bridal shower--

18:31.533 --> 18:34.166
for my, the girl we know together.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.600
-It was not for facials.
-[Judy] Okay.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.367
This was-- this was
an unnecessary overkill.

18:38.433 --> 18:41.166
[theme music]

18:41.233 --> 18:43.133
It's like if you
lift your spoon out

18:43.200 --> 18:45.934
without rinsing it off,
and instead of saying,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.100
"Listen, I'm not your maid,
clean up after yourself,"

18:49.166 --> 18:51.266
she packs your bags
and says goodbye.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.667
That would be an overkill, right?

18:52.734 --> 18:54.033
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Yeah.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.667
[theme music]

19:05.667 --> 19:07.967
[narrator] <i>Makeup artist Donyale Jones</i>

19:08.033 --> 19:09.500
<i>is accusing Erica Fields</i>

19:09.567 --> 19:11.533
<i>of refusing to pay for services</i>

19:11.600 --> 19:14.033
<i>and reporting her</i>
<i>to regulatory agencies.</i>

19:14.100 --> 19:18.467
This was an unnecessary
"I'm an unhappy lady,

19:18.533 --> 19:21.400
and I'm going to take
my aggressions out on somebody

19:21.467 --> 19:22.900
who's trying to make a living."

19:22.967 --> 19:25.667
This was unnecessary.
What kind of work do you do?

19:25.734 --> 19:27.166
I'm an accountant
and a business analyst.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.667
And she continued to call me

19:28.734 --> 19:30.033
which is the same date
that I filed that

19:30.100 --> 19:31.233
because she kept calling me.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.000
She wanted her 80 dollars.

19:33.066 --> 19:34.767
Well, at first, she wanted
her 80 dollars.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.834
She sent you a bill
for 80 dollars,

19:36.900 --> 19:38.834
you didn't pay the bill
for 80 dollars.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.700
Instead you called
the Better Business Bureau.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.500
I don't understand
what you were thinking.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.066
I was-- I was upset.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.600
Doesn't sound like
you're losing, right?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.700
-Oh, no--
-[Erica] I was upset. Honestly.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.266
I don't care
if you were upset or not.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.100
You should have sent her
the 80 dollars.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.800
She worked on you for nothing.

19:52.867 --> 19:56.467
She made you look gorgeous
for your engagement pictures,

19:56.533 --> 19:58.567
which you loved, for nothing.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.433
So, at least send her
the 80 dollars

20:00.500 --> 20:01.467
when she sent a bill.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.734
If you would've answered
her bill immediately

20:03.800 --> 20:05.100
by sending the 80 bucks,

20:05.166 --> 20:06.567
she wouldn't have kept
calling you.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.567
I understand.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.333
You just decided to ignore her.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.900
Well, she got
really unprofessional.

20:10.967 --> 20:12.367
[Judy] No, no, no, no,

20:12.433 --> 20:15.500
not when she sent you the bill
for 80 dollars.

20:15.567 --> 20:19.166
If you had immediately
sent her the 80 dollars,

20:19.233 --> 20:22.867
she would not have called you
again and again for her money.

20:22.934 --> 20:23.834
[Erica] Yes, ma'am.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.367
How'd you expect her
to contact you for the money?

20:26.433 --> 20:28.500
In writing. I asked her
to contact me in writing.

20:28.567 --> 20:29.967
Why should she
contact you in writing?

20:30.033 --> 20:31.967
Then she'd be,
then she's gonna charge.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.233
Because of things that are--

20:33.300 --> 20:35.333
she's saying that
I verbally said are not true.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.333
So, that's why

20:36.400 --> 20:37.333
I asked for it in writing.
What difference did it make?

20:37.400 --> 20:40.600
For 80 dollars,
it would have been over.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.066
Aren't you understanding that?

20:42.133 --> 20:44.500
You should learn that in
your married life with him.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.734
Don't sweat the small stuff.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.433
For 80 dollars,
which was a fair amount of money

20:50.500 --> 20:52.233
to cancel a deal,

20:52.300 --> 20:55.266
because after all,
once you sign that contract,

20:55.333 --> 20:57.734
Ms. Fields,
you are obligated to pay her

20:57.800 --> 20:59.700
675 dollars,

20:59.767 --> 21:02.266
whether you use her
or don't use her.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.100
-Okay.
-[Judy] That's your obligation.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.700
She says, "You know what,

21:05.767 --> 21:07.467
I don't want to deal
with this person.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.600
Just pay me
for the day that you came in

21:09.667 --> 21:10.633
that I spent with you,"

21:10.700 --> 21:13.266
which is a reasonable
amount of money. Very.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.100
Eighty dollars to do
your makeup for an hour.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.133
She took a lot of time;

21:16.200 --> 21:18.467
it wasn't just that she was
going to do your makeup,

21:18.533 --> 21:19.667
one and done.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.300
She was trying to impress you

21:21.367 --> 21:23.266
that she could do
a beautiful job,

21:23.333 --> 21:24.400
so you would retain her.

21:24.467 --> 21:25.967
-I agree.
-[Judy] For the whole wedding.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.734
I mean, you know,
it's very, very easy.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.667
So, this first thing
that I'm reading was overkill.

21:31.734 --> 21:32.667
Mm-hmm.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.166
[Judy] Now I'm
looking at the next one.

21:39.133 --> 21:44.400
This complaint, complaint
intake monitoring system, CIMS.

21:44.467 --> 21:45.633
That's what
they left at my door

21:45.700 --> 21:47.367
when they finished
their investigation.

21:47.433 --> 21:48.400
[Judy] Just a second.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.867
While they finished
the investigation,

21:49.934 --> 21:52.000
it was received on May 18th.

21:52.066 --> 21:55.867
And May 18th was
two weeks before your wedding.

21:55.934 --> 21:58.767
So, two weeks
before your wedding,

21:58.834 --> 22:00.900
you must have been
more stressed than you were

22:00.967 --> 22:02.567
She continued
to call and text me.

22:02.633 --> 22:05.166
[Judy] Why didn't you
just send her the money?

22:05.233 --> 22:07.100
It became a matter
of principle with you.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.100
It did, honestly.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.700
[Judy] Yeah. Well, you had
nothing else to do.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.800
You couldn't win
against anybody else.

22:11.867 --> 22:14.700
Why did you even in the midst
of planning your first wedding...

22:14.767 --> 22:15.700
How old are you?

22:15.767 --> 22:16.900
-Forty-one.
-[Judy] Forty-one.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.533
In the middle of planning
your first wedding,

22:18.600 --> 22:20.700
you're trying to put
this woman out of business,

22:20.767 --> 22:22.667
whose makeup you loved.

22:22.734 --> 22:24.934
-Well, I got--
-Whose makeup you loved.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.333
It's not that she did
a terrible job.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.700
She got involved at work.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.900
I got in trouble at work
for things that she did.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.633
[Judy] It doesn't matter to me.

22:32.700 --> 22:37.066
The problem, as Shakespeare said,
lies with you.

22:37.133 --> 22:40.200
You looked to get out of paying
for a service.

22:40.266 --> 22:42.333
And I don't think you looked
to get out of paying

22:42.400 --> 22:44.367
for the service
because of the money.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.367
-No, it wasn't the money.
-I think it was because

22:46.433 --> 22:49.133
you were really stressed
with everything else.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.000
-Agreed.
-And you took it out on her.

22:51.066 --> 22:52.767
And I think
that that's unreasonable.

22:52.834 --> 22:55.367
I do. I think that
that's very unreasonable.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.633
And minimally,
since you both agreed

22:57.700 --> 22:59.900
to modify the contract
to 80 dollars,

22:59.967 --> 23:02.166
that's minimally
what the plaintiff would get.

23:02.233 --> 23:04.200
She's suing for
a lot more than that

23:04.266 --> 23:06.200
and she's suing
for reporting her

23:06.266 --> 23:08.033
to the Better Business Bureau,

23:08.100 --> 23:09.834
which is going to give her
a negative rating,

23:09.900 --> 23:14.467
to the place that licenses her,
which is now on file

23:14.533 --> 23:17.233
all because you were
in a snit over the fact

23:17.300 --> 23:19.934
that you were stressed
over planning a wedding.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.200
Do you understand, sir?

23:21.266 --> 23:22.200
Yes, ma'am.

23:22.266 --> 23:24.133
[Judy] It's like if you
lift your spoon out

23:24.200 --> 23:26.600
without rinsing it off
in your house,

23:26.667 --> 23:29.600
and instead of saying,
"Listen, I'm not your maid.

23:29.667 --> 23:32.367
Clean up after yourself,"
which sounds familiar to me,

23:32.433 --> 23:35.266
I've even said it
a couple of times myself,

23:35.333 --> 23:37.667
she packs your bags
and says goodbye.

23:37.734 --> 23:39.066
That would be
an overkill, right?

23:39.133 --> 23:42.400
Yes, ma'am. [laughs]

23:42.467 --> 23:43.867
This was overkill.

23:43.934 --> 23:47.633
Plaintiff is suing in the amount
of 5,000 dollars,

23:47.700 --> 23:49.934
which I think is a bit
of an overkill myself.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.233
Are you still working?

23:51.300 --> 23:53.333
-Currently, yes.
-[Judy] Okay, great.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.300
So, she owes you 80 dollars
for the makeup,

23:56.367 --> 23:57.900
and she owes you
2,000 dollars

23:57.967 --> 24:00.700
for making trouble for you
that she had no right to do.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.934
-Okay.
-[Judy] And that was malicious.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.300
That's the judgment
of the court,

24:04.367 --> 24:05.433
2,080 dollars.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.400
Judgment for the plaintiff,
your counterclaim's dismissed.

24:07.467 --> 24:08.533
We're done. Thank you.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.767
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

24:09.834 --> 24:12.166
[theme music]

24:12.233 --> 24:13.967
I'm elated.
And I'm-I'm thankful

24:14.033 --> 24:15.934
that the judge saw
between all the lies.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.266
She was just unprofessional

24:17.333 --> 24:19.433
and wanted money earlier
than agreed upon.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.367
Guess she was trying to
get me to do something for nothing.

24:21.433 --> 24:24.100
I absolutely do now that
the judge has explained that.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.367
And the way she explained it
made sense.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.867
And I wish I had just given her
the 80 bucks and no tip.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.600
She could have just paid it
and we would have been done.

24:29.667 --> 24:30.734
I'm glad it's over.

24:31.166 --> 24:34.066
So, usually when two people
want to modify a contract,

24:34.133 --> 24:36.467
that usually has to be done
in the same form

24:36.533 --> 24:38.200
as the original contract was,

24:38.266 --> 24:39.967
so in this case,
it was in writing.

24:40.033 --> 24:41.567
So, usually any modification

24:41.633 --> 24:42.834
would also need to be
in writing.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.066
That's true.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.333
So why did you let them
off the hook?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.633
Well, it seemed to me
that the plaintiff

24:48.700 --> 24:50.233
was being very reasonable.

24:50.300 --> 24:53.900
And she said, "All right,
maybe this is not going to work.

24:53.967 --> 24:57.700
Just pay me for the hour
that we spent together."

24:57.767 --> 24:59.967
And that would be
by quantum meruit;

25:00.100 --> 25:01.900
pay for just the work
that was done,

25:01.967 --> 25:03.934
and not for anything
in the future,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.066
which seemed totally reasonable.

25:06.133 --> 25:09.600
And I actually believe
that the defendant said,

25:09.667 --> 25:11.300
okay, and hung up.

25:11.367 --> 25:13.233
The woman sent her a bill
right away.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.600
She didn't pay it and had
no intention of paying it.

25:16.667 --> 25:19.166
The woman agreed to say,
"We're done.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.333
Just pay me the 80 bucks

25:20.400 --> 25:22.667
that I usually charge somebody
for a day's work."

25:22.734 --> 25:24.734
I thought that that was
unconscionable.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.500
I still think
it's unconscionable.

25:26.567 --> 25:30.800
So, that's why
we massaged the rule.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.800
Sometimes you get to do that.

25:33.867 --> 25:34.800
For justice.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.633
For justice.
That's absolutely right.
