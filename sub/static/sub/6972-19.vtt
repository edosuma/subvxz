00:17.300 --> 00:19.300
Play ball!

00:29.700 --> 00:31.200
Ball four!

00:31.200 --> 00:33.200
Take your base!

00:36.400 --> 00:38.700
That's it, Moose!
You're getting close now! Bring it, son!

00:38.700 --> 00:41.000
Moose couldn't find the plate
if you nailed it to his ass.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Shut your pie hole, Piney.
Kid's got to learn.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.600
Come straight over the top, Moose.
Straight over the top. Come on!

00:48.400 --> 00:51.000
Ah, damn.
Exley's up.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.800
Back up! Exley's up!
Back up!

01:01.100 --> 01:03.800
You sure your boy got the right
prescription in those spectacles?

01:03.800 --> 01:09.200
Ah, don't worry, Ex. See, I told him to throw it
right at your big, nappy, home-run-hitting head.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.300
So you can bet a hundred clams that
ball's going anywhere but there.

01:19.900 --> 01:24.100
Foul! Foul ball!
Foul! Foul ball!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.500
Ball!

02:03.100 --> 02:06.700
- Moose! Straight over the top.
- Over the top. Yes.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.199
Hey, Ex. I heard the Yankees
have been calling you.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.200
I'm fine playing here in the Cactus
leagues. It's nice and quiet.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.500
Ball!

02:21.500 --> 02:24.100
Leave the cactus alone, son!

02:24.700 --> 02:28.200
Gee, I don't know, Ex. The Yanks could
use those 60 home runs a year.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.100
Well, now that, uh, Jackie Robinson's
up there in the Bigs...

02:31.100 --> 02:33.000
...people are saying you're going to be next.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.700
The first black Negro man of color
in the American League.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.700
Shoot, Ex, you'll be famous, man.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.800
I don't want to be no famous man.
Just want to be a man.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.400
Over the top! Over the top!
Over the top, man!

02:58.700 --> 03:01.800
Fair ball! Home run!
Home run!

03:03.900 --> 03:06.000
Sixty-one.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
What do you boys want? We're just
playing a baseball game, here.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.300
We got no beef with you, sir. It's that black
Babe Ruth hiding behind you.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.200
Josh Exley.
That's all we come for.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.100
Well, you can't have him.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.600
We heard the Yankees want
to let a Nigger play ball...

03:54.600 --> 03:58.500
...so we just figure we're going to play
with him a little bit some first.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.100
Now, all you Niggers and Nigger-lovers!

04:02.100 --> 04:04.300
You can go home!

04:04.300 --> 04:06.500
It's Ex we want.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.700
That's what I'm talking about, Moose,
straight over the top.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.100
Come on, straight over
the top with it.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.700
Come on, get the guns.
Get the guns.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.600
You boys ain't so tough without
your shotguns, are you, fellows?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.700
You ain't nothing but a coward.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.200
Hiding behind your mama's bedsheet.
Let's see your face.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.400
Holy mother of...

05:16.100 --> 05:17.700
In The Big Inning

05:18.900 --> 05:22.400
It's a gorgeous day for baseball
here in the City of The Angels...

05:22.400 --> 05:26.700
...and I'm told it's a gorgeous day
all over our republic today...

05:26.700 --> 05:30.600
...from Bangor to Bellflower,
from Amarillo to Anchorage...

05:30.600 --> 05:35.300
...the sun is shining and it's a
perfect day to play baseball...

05:35.300 --> 05:39.600
Eddie Perez will start it off....
That ball is ripped...

05:51.400 --> 05:55.600
Mulder, it is such a
gorgeous day outside.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.500
Have you ever entertained the idea of
trying to find life on this planet?

05:59.500 --> 06:05.500
I have seen the life on this planet, Scully,
and that is exactly why I am looking elsewhere.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.400
Did you bring enough ice cream to
share with the rest of the class?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.600
It's not ice cream.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.500
It's a nonfat tofutti rice dreamsicle.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.300
Bet the air in my mouth
tastes better than that.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.900
- You sure know how to live it up, Scully.
- Oh, you're Mr. Live-it-up.

06:26.900 --> 06:32.700
Mulder, you're really Mr. Squeeze-every-last-drop
out-of-this-sweet-life, aren't you?

06:32.700 --> 06:37.100
On this precious Saturday you've got us
grabbing life by the testes...

06:37.100 --> 06:40.600
...stealing reference books from the
FBI library in order to go through...

06:40.600 --> 06:47.300
...New Mexico newspaper obituaries for the
years 1940 to 1949 and for what joyful purpose?

06:47.300 --> 06:51.100
Looking for anomalies, Scully. Do you know
how many so-called "flying disc" reports...

06:51.100 --> 06:53.600
...there were in New Mexico in the 1940s?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.200
I don't care. Mulder, this is
a needle in a haystack.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.300
These poor souls have been
dead for 50 years.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.900
Let them rest in peace.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.300
No, I won't sit idly by as you hurl cliches at me.
Preparation is the father of inspiration.

07:06.300 --> 07:10.000
- Necessity is the mother of invention.
- The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.100
Eat, drink and be merry,
for tomorrow we may die.

07:12.100 --> 07:16.400
I scream, you scream, we all scream for
nonfat tofutti rice dreamsicles.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.100
Mulder!

07:23.100 --> 07:25.000
Mulder!?

07:25.300 --> 07:27.300
You cheat.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.400
I can't believe that you've been reading
about baseball this whole time.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.500
I'm reading the box scores, Scully.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.000
You'd like it. It's like the
Pythagorean Theorem for jocks.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.600
It distills all the chaos and action of
any game in the history of all...

07:38.600 --> 07:42.000
...baseball games into one tiny, perfect,
rectangular sequence of numbers.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.100
I can look at this box and I can recreate
exactly what happened on some...

07:46.100 --> 07:49.300
...sunny summer day back in 1947.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.200
It's like the numbers talk to me,
they comfort me.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.900
They tell me that even though lots of things can
change some things do remain the same. It's...

07:55.900 --> 07:58.000
Boring.

07:58.700 --> 08:02.200
Mulder, can I ask you a
personal question?

08:02.300 --> 08:03.400
Of course not.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.000
Did your mother ever tell you to go
outside and play?

08:08.900 --> 08:12.100
- Is that... Arthur Dales?
- Mulder?

08:17.000 --> 08:21.600
You just defaced property of
the U.S. Government.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200
You rebel.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.200
What in hell took you so long?

08:38.200 --> 08:40.500
I'm-I'm sorry, sir, I'm-I'm
looking for Arthur Dales.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.000
I'm Arthur Dales.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.800
- No, you're not.
- Don't be a wiseass, son.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.400
No, I-I'm sorry, sir, I know Arthur Dales
and you're not Arthur Dales.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.500
Arthur Dales is my brother.
My name also happens to be Arthur Dales.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.600
It's the same name, different guy.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.500
The other Arthur, he moved to
Florida the lucky bastard.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
Now, our parents weren't exactly big in the
imagination department when it came to names.

09:04.500 --> 09:08.700
If it would help you wrapping your little head
around this stupefying mystery, ...

09:08.700 --> 09:15.300
...Agent Mulder, we had a sister named
Arthur, too and a goldfish.

09:15.500 --> 09:19.200
- How do you know my name?
- My brother told me all about you.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.600
He said you were the biggest jackass
in the Bureau since he retired.

09:23.600 --> 09:30.700
Yeah, we're big fans. Sometimes we'd stay awake
for hours at night just talking about you.

09:30.700 --> 09:36.700
Just fascinating. Now, unless you're hiding
some Chinese food let's call it a day.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.000
Mr. Dales, I have a, uh...

09:45.100 --> 09:48.400
I have a photo here of your
brother. Maybe it's you.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.500
It's from many years ago and you're,
you're standing in Roswell, New Mexico.

09:51.500 --> 09:56.000
Roswell. That's me.
I was a cop once in Roswell.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.500
Okay, and you're standing with Negro League
legend Josh Exley who disappeared...

09:59.500 --> 10:03.000
...without a trace during a season in
which he reportedly hit 60 home runs.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.300
- Sixty-one.
- Sixty-one home runs in 1948.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.200
Forty-seven.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.300
'47, whatever. I don't really care about
the baseball, so much, sir.

10:11.300 --> 10:15.700
What I care about is this man in the picture
with you. I believe to be an alien bounty hunter.

10:15.700 --> 10:19.400
Of course you don't care about
the baseball, Mr. Mulder.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.500
You only bothered my brother about the important
things like government conspiracies...

10:23.500 --> 10:26.800
...and alien bounty hunters and
the truth with a capital "T."

10:26.800 --> 10:29.700
- Wait a minute. I like baseball.
- You like baseball, huh?
- Yeah.

10:29.700 --> 10:34.200
How many home runs did
Mickey Mantle hit?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.400
A hundred and sixty-three.

10:38.700 --> 10:43.600
Righty. 373 lefty.
536 total.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.200
What you fail to understand
in your joyless myopia...

10:49.200 --> 10:55.200
...is that baseball is the key to life,
the Rosetta Stone, if you will.

10:55.200 --> 11:00.000
If you just understood baseball better all
your other questions your, your...

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
...the, uh... the aliens, the conspiracies
they would all, in their way be answered...

11:05.000 --> 11:08.200
- ...by the baseball gods.
- Yes, sir, that may be true.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.700
I'm thinking that your experience in Roswell
could be germane to a conspiracy...

11:11.700 --> 11:14.600
...between men in our government and
these shape-shifting alien beings.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.900
Oh, don't bore me, son.

11:16.900 --> 11:22.200
My brother Arthur started the X-Files with
the Federal Bureau of Obfuscation...

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
...before you were born.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.800
He was working for the FBI and hunting for aliens
when you were watching My Best Friend's Martians.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.600
You say "shape-shifting."

11:32.600 --> 11:39.500
Agent Mulder, do you believe that love
can make a man shape-shift?

11:42.700 --> 11:45.800
I guess... women change men all the time.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.300
I'm not talking about women.
I'm talking about love. Passion.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.700
Like the passion you have for
proving extra-terrestrial life.

11:52.700 --> 11:58.000
Do you believe that that passion
can change your very nature?

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Can make you shape-shift from a man
into something other than a man?

12:04.800 --> 12:08.800
What exactly has your brother
told you about me?

12:11.100 --> 12:14.600
Mr. Dales, if you and your brother have
really known about this bounty hunter...

12:14.600 --> 12:18.400
...and plans for colonization for the last 50 years
why the hell wouldn't you have told anybody?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.800
- Nobody'd believe me.
- I would have believed you.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.100
You weren't... ripe.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.000
Not ripe?

12:25.300 --> 12:28.800
Let me tell you something:
I have been ripe for years. I am way past ripe.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.500
I'm so ripe I'm rotten. This cuts to
the very heart of the mystery...

12:31.500 --> 12:33.800
...of what I've been doing with my
life for the past ten years.

12:33.800 --> 12:38.000
Oh, the heart of the mystery,
the heart of the mystery.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.200
Ah, there you are.

12:42.500 --> 12:47.300
Mr. Mulder... maybe you'd better start
paying a little less attention...

12:47.300 --> 12:53.300
...to the heart of the mystery and a little
more attention to the mystery of the heart.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.300
- You got a dime?
- What is this?

12:55.300 --> 12:58.300
This little fellow goes by the
name of Pete Rosebud.

12:58.300 --> 13:03.100
If you keep pumping coffee money into him
he'll tell you a story about baseball...

13:03.100 --> 13:07.000
- ...and aliens and bounty hunters.
- You're making me feel like a child.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
Perfect. That's exactly the right
place to start from, then, isn't it?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.600
Now, the first thing you got to
know about baseball is...

13:13.600 --> 13:17.700
...it keeps you forever young.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.000
"Keep Baseball Pure - Keep Baseball White
$500 Reward For Killing Josh Exley."

13:34.500 --> 13:36.200
Mr. Exley?

13:36.400 --> 13:41.400
Mr. Exley, my name's Arthur Dales. I'm an
employee of the Roswell police department.

13:43.100 --> 13:47.800
- Have I broken a law, sir?
- You stole... second base in the third inning.

13:47.800 --> 13:52.100
I'm a witness. Officer, I seen Ex
steal... at least 50 bases this year.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.600
No, sir, you haven't broken any laws.
Not that I'm aware of.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.200
Um, I've been assigned by my superiors
to protect you against certain parties.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.600
I'm the one need protection from certain parties.
Ex here, he in bed by 8:00 every night.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.700
I appreciate your concern,
sir but I can protect myself.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.800
Mr. Exley, I'm not a big sports
hero like yourself, sir...

14:10.800 --> 14:14.900
...and I really don't have an opinion on
Negroes or Jews or Communists or...

14:14.900 --> 14:19.400
...even Canadians and vegetarians, for that matter
but I cannot stomach the murder of a man...

14:19.400 --> 14:22.800
...of any persuasion or any color being
flaunted and solicited in my town.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.900
Not on my watch. So you can be safe with me
in a cell down at the precinct...

14:25.900 --> 14:29.000
...or you can be safe with
me here on the bus.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.700
Seeing as how this is still America
you're free to choose, sir.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.800
Vous etes sans coeur.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.900
Vous etes sans coeur, Mademoiselle.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.100
Vous etes sans coeur... Coeur...

14:50.100 --> 14:53.300
Hey, Officer Dales, you're a
decent man, ain't you?

14:53.300 --> 14:54.500
I try to be.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.000
Well, the fellas feel like the umps would
treat us better if you got us...

14:57.000 --> 15:01.600
- ...eight more uniforms like these to play in.
- Yeah, you could change your name from...

15:01.600 --> 15:06.100
...the Roswell grays to the
Roswell Black and Blues.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.400
What's the matter, Arthur?

16:23.400 --> 16:27.600
You look like you ain't never
seen a black man before.

16:34.800 --> 16:39.800
I've got to give it to you, Arthur. Calling a Negro
league team from Roswell the Grays is pretty clever.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.700
E.T. steal home.
E.T. steal home.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.800
I didn't make that up.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.400
You seriously want me to believe that
Josh Exley maybe one of the greatest...

16:47.400 --> 16:52.800
- ...ballplayers of all times, was an alien?
- They're all aliens, Agent Mulder, all the great ones.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.500
- Babe Ruth was an alien?
- Yeah.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.600
- Joe DiMaggio?
- Sure.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.400
- Willie Mays?
- Well, obviously.

16:59.400 --> 17:04.099
- Mantle? Koufax? Gibson?
- Bob or Kirk?

17:04.099 --> 17:10.599
See, none of the great ones fit in,
not in this world, not in any other world.

17:11.800 --> 17:17.099
They're all aliens, Mulder, until they step
between the white chalk lines, ...

17:17.099 --> 17:23.599
...until they step on the outfield grass.
Like clockwork. Poorboy with my medicine.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.500
Give the kid a tip, will ya?

17:28.800 --> 17:32.700
So I assume you're speaking
metaphorically?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.900
Speaking metaphorically is for young
men like you, Agent MacGyver.

17:36.900 --> 17:41.400
I don't have time for that.
I only have time to speak the truth.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.500
You're a regular Rockefeller, ain't you?

17:56.500 --> 17:59.700
If Ex hits a couple of dingers,
that'll be 60. That ties The Babe.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.900
Aw, that ball's worth nothing. Ex ain't a major
leaguer, so the record don't count.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.400
- Does, too.
- Does not.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.100
- It does, too.
- It does not.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.500
- Does, too.
- Does not.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
- Does...
- Not.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.500
Perfect day for a ball game.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.600
There, uh... there was a bee on you.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.800
- Must have been a real big one.
- Could have ripped your head off.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.700
Hey, Arthur...

20:14.600 --> 20:16.700
Thanks.

20:17.700 --> 20:22.800
Officer Arthur Dales making the
world safe for baseball and Negroes.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.600
Play ball.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
Time! Time!

20:59.100 --> 21:03.100
Do you know your name, son?
Josh, do you know where you are?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
Josh, man, wake up.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.300
Do you know where you're from?

21:14.100 --> 21:16.500
Macon...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.700
Macon, Georgia?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.400
Macon police department.
Can I help you?

21:50.400 --> 21:53.900
Yeah, my name's Arthur Dales.
I'm with the Roswell Police Department.

21:53.900 --> 21:58.600
I'm doing a background check on a gentlemen
I believe is from your area. His name is Josh Exley.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.200
You want information on a Josh Exley?

22:05.900 --> 22:08.300
Yeah, the name rings a bell.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.800
Yeah, I got a Josh Exley.

22:10.800 --> 22:15.700
A six-year-old colored boy disappeared
oh, maybe five years ago.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.500
Now do you got a read on this
Josh Exley's whereabouts?

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
Six years old?

22:22.100 --> 22:25.100
- You wanted to see me about running
some chemical tests, Arthur?
- Yeah. Hold on.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.600
That would make him 11 now?
No, that can't be the one.

22:30.900 --> 22:33.300
I love my job.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.400
And is that all you have?
Are you certain?

22:36.400 --> 22:40.800
Certain as the sunrise.
I'm sorry, son.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.000
Did you say where you
were calling from?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.600
- Roswell... Roswell, New Mexico.
- Roswell.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.300
- Morning, Poorboy.
- Morning, Ex. How's the melon?

22:54.300 --> 22:58.800
- My melon's fine. That boy throws like a lady.
- I hear the Yankee scouts are here today.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.800
- Going to hit numero six-oh?
- Ain't no scouts here today.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.400
Sure there are. Look.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.300
Right over there.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
I'll be damned.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.300
Hey, kids.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.100
So how's it going?

23:18.100 --> 23:21.100
- Ex is stinking up the diamond.
- Oh, yeah?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.600
- Yeah.
- Well, anybody can have a bad day.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.100
Yeah, but the Yankee scouts
are in attendance today.

23:26.100 --> 23:30.800
I don't think they'll relish the idea of him being in
the majors after such a piss-poor outing as this.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
Came on, Exley!

23:32.800 --> 23:34.800
Strike two!

23:50.300 --> 23:53.200
Two balls, two strikes now.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.500
Ex...

24:15.000 --> 24:17.800
- Why did you tank that game today?
- I won that game today.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.300
You tanked the game today.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.100
You want me to tell you why?

24:23.100 --> 24:25.400
Because your name's not Josh Exley.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.400
Josh Exley is a six-year-old kid who
disappeared from Macon, Georgia...

24:28.400 --> 24:30.700
...about the same time that
you showed up in Roswell.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.500
- I ain't never been to Macon.
- When you got beaned, you said you were from Macon.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.500
Well, I also spoke tongues like I did
when I was a little boy in church.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.800
I was joking, Arthur. Relax.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.300
I'm relaxed.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.800
You're hiding something. That's why you
don't dare get into the major leagues...

24:51.800 --> 24:55.300
...'cause the sports writers and everybody
would be digging around and...

24:55.300 --> 24:57.500
...they'd find out what it is, right?

24:57.500 --> 25:00.500
So you tanked the game in front
of those scouts today.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.300
Disappointing those kids, ...

25:03.300 --> 25:06.800
...disappointing your teammates,
disappointing your race...

25:06.800 --> 25:09.900
Look here, don't go talking about my race.
You don't know nothing about my race.

25:09.900 --> 25:14.900
I know that liars come in all colors.

25:15.500 --> 25:19.800
You got a secret, and famous or not
I'm going to find out what it is.

25:19.800 --> 25:26.300
While you're out chasing secrets you
make sure you're chasing the right ones.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.300
Ex?

27:09.100 --> 27:10.400
Thank you.

27:14.200 --> 27:20.200
This is ridiculous. You're supposed
to be a big, bad policeman.

27:21.100 --> 27:25.500
Now, hold up, Arthur. Now, before you
go fainting again, listen to me.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.500
It's me, Arthur.
It's Ex.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.700
This is an interesting dream.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.600
Wake up.
Come on, Artie.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.900
Man, you ain't dreaming.

27:35.900 --> 27:40.500
This is what I really look like.
This is the real me.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
Ex?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.100
It's really you under there, Ex?

27:52.100 --> 27:54.700
I'm not "under" anything, Arthur, ...

27:54.700 --> 27:58.500
...and I'm trying not to be insulted
by your reaction to my true face.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.900
Look, would it be easier
if I looked like this?

28:07.100 --> 28:10.500
Would this be easier for you to handle?

28:15.700 --> 28:17.500
No. Somehow, that's even weirder.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.900
Bus leaves in five...

28:22.100 --> 28:28.800
So why did you, uh, leave your
family in, uh... in Georgia?

28:29.000 --> 28:32.400
My people guard their
privacy zealously.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.000
I can understand that.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.500
They don't like for us to
intermingle with your people.

28:37.500 --> 28:43.800
Their philosophy is we stick to ourselves;
you stick to yourselves, everybody's happy.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.700
So what happened?

28:45.700 --> 28:48.000
Well, you know what happened.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.600
You fell in love with
an earth woman.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.100
No.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.600
I saw a baseball game.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.000
See, there's something you got
to understand about my race.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.900
We don't have a word for laughter.
We don't laugh.

29:05.900 --> 29:10.200
I don't know if you noticed in between
all that fainting you was doing but...

29:10.200 --> 29:15.500
...we have very tiny mouths,
so no smiling even.

29:15.900 --> 29:20.000
But I tell you, when I saw that
baseball game being played...

29:20.000 --> 29:25.100
...this laughter just... it just
rose up out of me.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.900
- You know, the sound the ball
makes when it hits the bat?
- Yeah.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.200
It was like music to me. You know,
the smell of the grass, 11 men.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.900
First unnecessary thing I ever done
in my life and I fell in love.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.400
I didn't know the unnecessary
could feel so good.

29:40.400 --> 29:46.000
You know, the game was meaningless but
it seemed to mean everything to me.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.200
It was useless, but perfect.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.300
Yeah, like, uh... like a rose.

29:54.300 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like a rose.
See? You get it, Arthur. You're a fan.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.400
But I tell you, from that moment on I just
couldn't fix myself to go home.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.200
Come on up here, Ex? Let's hear that
beautiful voice you got on you.

30:09.200 --> 30:17.300
We'll all be together in that land...
We'll all be together in that land...

30:17.300 --> 30:21.900
We'll all be together in that land...

30:21.900 --> 30:30.600
Where I'm bound oh, Lord...
We'll all be together in that land...

30:30.600 --> 30:35.300
We'll all be together in that land...

30:37.600 --> 30:42.300
Gray Bus Lines
You CAN Go Home Again...

30:42.300 --> 30:45.700
Let me get this straight: a free-spirited
alien fell in love with baseball...

30:45.700 --> 30:49.600
...and ran away from the other non-fun-having
aliens and made himself black, ...

30:49.600 --> 30:53.100
...because that would prevent him from getting
to the majors where his unspeakable secret...

30:53.100 --> 30:56.900
...might be discovered by an intrusive press
and public and you're also implying that--

30:56.900 --> 31:02.300
You certainly have a knack for turning
chicken salad into chicken spit.

31:02.300 --> 31:05.600
You're also implying that this baseball-playing
alien has something to do...

31:05.600 --> 31:09.200
...with the famous Roswell UFO
crash of July '47, aren't you?

31:09.200 --> 31:12.600
You're just dying to connect
the dots aren't you, son?

31:12.600 --> 31:18.400
Look, I give you some wood and I ask you
for a cabinet. You build me a cathedral.

31:18.400 --> 31:24.400
I don't want a cathedral. I like where I live.
I just want a place to put my TV.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.200
Understand my drift?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.700
Drift it is, sir.

31:30.700 --> 31:34.700
Trust the tale, Agent MacGyver,
not the teller.

31:34.700 --> 31:39.000
That which fascinates us
is by definition true.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Speaking metaphorically, of course.

31:42.300 --> 31:46.000
Okay, so was Ex a man who was metaphorically
an alien or an alien who was...

31:46.000 --> 31:52.200
...metaphorically a man or a something in between
that was literally an alien-human hybrid?

31:59.900 --> 32:03.700
It's official.
I am a horse's ass.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.600
What is it to be a human, Fox?
Is it to have the chemistry of a man?

32:09.600 --> 32:15.200
In the universal scheme of things a dog's
chemistry is nearly identical to that of a man.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.400
But is a dog like a man?

32:17.400 --> 32:23.100
Well, I have noticed over the course of time, a man
and his dog will often start to look like one another.

32:23.100 --> 32:28.400
To be a man is to have the heart of a man.
Integrity, decency, sympathy:

32:28.400 --> 32:36.800
These are the things that make a man a man and Ex
had them all, had them all, more than you or I.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.500
- Dales.
- Arthur, what the heck?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.900
Ted?
Calm down. What is it?

32:53.900 --> 32:57.100
This goo on the glove you
gave me, is this a joke?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.300
Why?

32:58.300 --> 33:01.200
It's not like any chemical
compound I've ever seen.

33:01.200 --> 33:06.200
It's from a life-form which doesn't seem to be
carbon-based which, by the way, is impossible.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.700
This is way out of my league.

33:07.700 --> 33:10.700
I called to the FBI and the communicable
disease center in Washington...

33:10.700 --> 33:14.300
Washington? Oh, no, Ted, you didn't?
Nobody was supposed to know about this.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.700
Can you... can you get
the glove back to me?

33:16.700 --> 33:19.200
Sure, soon as I finish up here.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.200
I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm Josh.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.700
Oh, I know who you are. Only the best
damn ball player west of the Bronx.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.400
Oh, thank you, sir. Arthur sent me
down here to explain this substance.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.900
- That's my mitt it ruined.
- Where is this stuff from? Where did you get it?

33:42.900 --> 33:44.700
Mars.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.800
Actually, just to the left of Mars.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.800
What do you think you're doing?!

34:16.900 --> 34:18.400
Ex?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.699
Ex, there's this fella down
at the precinct...

34:21.699 --> 34:25.699
...who's willing to swear on his life
that you killed a man this afternoon.

34:25.699 --> 34:29.699
Now, I'm not sure what's... what's
going on here but I...

34:29.699 --> 34:34.800
...I do know that you're no murderer.
You're going to have to get out of town, Ex.

34:49.500 --> 34:54.500
- Life ain't like baseball, is it?
- No. No, it's not.

34:55.199 --> 34:58.800
I had a talk with my relative.
A good talk.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.300
He made me understand reason, Arthur.
Family's more important than any game.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.000
So... I got to go home.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.900
You still consider them to be your family?

35:08.900 --> 35:12.200
Of course I do.
Who you think my family is?

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
I don't know. Your team?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.900
Don't get cornball on me, man.
Next thing you're gonna be telling me...

35:17.900 --> 35:22.800
...is I owe it to all the little kids to break the home-run record,
or I owe it to the black folks who think I'm one of them, ...

35:22.800 --> 35:25.200
...to make it to the majors or
I should just keep playing...

35:25.200 --> 35:30.600
...out of some meaningless human
concept of pride or loyalty.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.800
I don't know, Ex.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.000
We don't think like that, man.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.200
We may be able to look likey'all,
but we ain't y'all.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.900
- You know the big thing that separates us from you?
- What's that?

35:43.300 --> 35:45.600
We got rhythm.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.100
- Hey... I better go.
- Yeah.

36:03.100 --> 36:06.600
Hey... you do me a favor?

36:06.600 --> 36:10.700
Will you tell people what
I did on the field?

36:10.700 --> 36:12.900
Will you tell your kids how
I played the game?

36:12.900 --> 36:15.500
You know I will, Ex.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.700
Hey, man, uh... one more thing.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.700
What?

36:23.100 --> 36:26.900
You got a pretty good arm on you, boy.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.400
You may think you know the man, Dales,
but believe me, you do not know the man.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.100
You don't know what I know and you
don't know what I don't know.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.200
This is no minor-league,
Mexico cowboy cop crap.

36:48.200 --> 36:52.400
If I told you what was really going on you'd
just stare at me in wild-eyed wonder and...

36:52.400 --> 36:57.200
...pee your pants like a baby. Now, tell me
what I want to know. Where's Exley?

36:57.200 --> 37:00.000
I told you, he told me
he was going home.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Play ball!

37:02.200 --> 37:06.700
You sure your boy got the right
prescription in those spectacles?

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
Home run!

37:12.800 --> 37:15.000
I got a witness puts him
at the murder scene.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.800
Now, I know they have a tendency to look alike
but unless he's got a guy running around town...

37:18.800 --> 37:22.400
...looks identical to him he is a murderer,
you could be an accomplice and...

37:22.400 --> 37:27.200
...the two of you fast sliding down a giant
razor blade into a big old glass of lemonade.

37:35.300 --> 37:38.300
But, you hand him over...

37:38.300 --> 37:41.200
You can wear your big hat and that
pretty badge as long as you want.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.200
Are we finished?

37:45.100 --> 37:47.200
No, Mr. Dales...

37:47.200 --> 37:50.100
You're finished.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
God!

38:32.000 --> 38:34.300
Come on.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.600
It's over.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.500
I know.

38:46.500 --> 38:49.200
I warned you.
You didn't listen.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.800
Now you die.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.200
It's the right thing to do.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.500
What do you know of the
right thing to do?

39:02.500 --> 39:06.700
You, who would risk exposing
the entire project for a game?

39:06.700 --> 39:09.000
A game!

39:09.600 --> 39:11.900
I hit a home run tonight.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.700
A home run?

39:13.700 --> 39:16.400
Number 61.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.800
I set a record.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.900
Show me your true face so you
can die with dignity.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.400
As your executioner I show you my
true face before I kill you.

39:40.300 --> 39:46.600
Show me your true face or you
will die without honor.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.500
This is my true face.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.200
So be it.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.300
No!

40:00.300 --> 40:02.100
Stop!

40:05.200 --> 40:07.200
Ex?!

40:08.900 --> 40:11.800
No... Let me be!
Let me be!

40:16.000 --> 40:20.100
Don't. Get off me.
Our blood is like acid to you people.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.700
Arthur, get away.
Don't touch it.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.200
It's just blood, Ex. Look.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.600
It's just blood.

40:56.100 --> 41:00.500
Come and go with me to that land...

41:00.700 --> 41:04.800
Come and go with me to that land...

41:05.300 --> 41:09.900
Come and go with me to that land...

41:09.900 --> 41:14.100
Where I'm bound...

41:14.100 --> 41:18.200
I got a brother in that land...

41:18.400 --> 41:22.700
I got a brother in that land...

41:22.900 --> 41:27.400
I got a brother in that land...

41:27.400 --> 41:29.500
Where I'm bound...

41:29.600 --> 41:31.800
Where I'm bound...

41:31.800 --> 41:36.000
I got a brother in that land...

41:36.200 --> 41:40.600
I got a brother in that land...

41:40.800 --> 41:45.400
I got a brother in that land...

41:45.400 --> 41:48.500
Where I'm bound...

41:57.400 --> 41:59.500
So, uh...

41:59.500 --> 42:03.300
I get this message marked "urgent"...

42:03.300 --> 42:08.700
...on my answering service from one Fox Mantle
telling me to come down to the park...

42:08.700 --> 42:14.600
...for a very special very early or
very late birthday present.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.600
And, Mulder...

42:16.600 --> 42:21.100
I don't see any nicely wrapped
presents lying around so, what gives?

42:21.300 --> 42:25.600
- You've never hit a baseball, have you, Scully?
- No, I guess I have, uh...

42:25.600 --> 42:30.100
...found more necessary things
to do with my time than...

42:30.100 --> 42:33.600
...slap a piece of horsehide with a stick.

42:34.300 --> 42:37.100
Get over here, Scully.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.700
This my birthday present, Mulder?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.300
- You shouldn't have.
- This ain't cheap.

42:52.300 --> 42:56.400
I'm paying that kid ten bucks
an hour to shag balls.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.500
Hey, it's not a bad piece of ash, huh?

43:00.500 --> 43:05.600
The bat... talking about the bat. Now, don't
strangle it. You just want to shake hands with it.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.900
"Hello, Mr. Bat. It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance."

43:07.900 --> 43:11.400
"Oh, no, no, Ms. Scully.
The pleasure's all mine."

43:11.400 --> 43:15.200
Okay, now, we want to... we want
to go hips before hands, okay?

43:15.200 --> 43:20.300
We want to stride forward and turn. That's all
we're thinking about. So, we go hips...

43:20.300 --> 43:22.100
- ...before hands, all right?
- Okay.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.400
One more time.

43:23.400 --> 43:26.400
- Hips... before hands, all right?
- Yeah.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.600
- What is it?
- Hips before hands.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.200
Right. We're going to wait on the pitch.
We're going to keep our eye on the ball.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.000
Then, we're just going to make contact.
We're not going to think.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.600
We're just going to let it fly, Scully, okay?

43:38.400 --> 43:40.800
- Ready?
- I'm in the middle.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.400
All right, fire away, Poorboy.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.800
That's good.

43:47.800 --> 43:52.300
All right, what you may find is you
concentrate on hitting that little ball...

43:52.300 --> 43:56.200
The rest of the world just fades away,
all your everyday, nagging concerns.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.400
The ticking of your biological clock.

43:58.400 --> 44:03.000
How you probably couldn't afford that nice,
new suede coat on a G-Woman's salary.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
How you threw away a promising
career in medicine...

44:06.000 --> 44:10.300
...to hunt aliens with a crackpot,
albeit brilliant, partner.

44:10.300 --> 44:14.200
Getting into the heart of a
global conspiracy.

44:14.200 --> 44:17.200
Your obscenely overdue triple-X bill.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.400
Oh, I... I'm sorry, Scully. Those last
two problems are mine, not yours.

44:21.400 --> 44:26.100
Shut up, Mulder.
I'm playing baseball.
