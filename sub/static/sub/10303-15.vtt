01:26.280 --> 01:28.396
Cut it out.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.395
Cut it out, Bud.
I'm just not in the mood right now.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.238
How could you not be in the mood?

01:36.440 --> 01:40.115
When we did it a month ago, you said it
was the best three minutes of your life.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.792
It was. I'm just not ready
for an encore yet.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.435
I like to take my time.
It makes it special.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.396
You know,
if it gets much more special...

01:54.600 --> 01:57.398
...I won't be able to guarantee
a full three minutes.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.034
Trust me. It'll be better
when we both really want it.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.838
Okay. Okay, fine.
I'm not an animal. I can wait.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.991
<i>Mental note:
Sleep on stomach tonight.</i>

02:37.320 --> 02:38.992
I give up.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.953
Today was the worst day of my life.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.758
Worse than the day you found out...

02:43.960 --> 02:46.554
...that big brush in the bathroom
wasn't for your teeth?

02:48.720 --> 02:51.154
Okay,
the second-worst day of my life.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.590
I went to go read
for this great movie part...

02:53.800 --> 02:57.076
...but before I had a chance to audition,
they gave it to somebody else.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.710
- Who?
- Meryl Streep.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.668
Now, come on, what does she have
that I don't have?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.713
What? You mean,
besides the Oscars, the fame...

03:07.920 --> 03:10.514
...and the command
of the English language?

03:11.720 --> 03:14.757
- Yeah.
- Well, it begins with a T.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.398
I got those.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.551
Talent, Gump.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.832
See, in short, Kel, the problem with
your acting career is that...

03:27.040 --> 03:30.316
...well, you stink. You reek.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.954
What you should be reading for
is the girl who says:

03:33.160 --> 03:35.390
"If you're under 18,
please hang up now."

03:38.720 --> 03:41.553
Not that I would ever use
those things.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.515
Sometimes you just misdial
calling the Library of Congress.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.833
The numbers are so similar.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.717
You don't think I'm good enough
to be an actress?

03:52.920 --> 03:55.434
You're hardly a believable Kelly.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.511
So you ready?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.557
You should be ashamed of yourself.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.957
I am. You ready?

04:10.040 --> 04:12.349
No, I'm not ready.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.911
I can't believe I let you have
what you claimed was sex with me.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.795
You are just so mean to your sister.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.911
Yeah. So? You ready?

04:26.920 --> 04:30.913
A good, caring brother
would help build her self-esteem.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.555
I thought you were different
from other guys.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.432
I thought you were sensitive.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.311
I'm sensitive. I am. Honest.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.195
I come from a long line of caring,
sensitive, Bundy men.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.875
Where's my shotgun?

04:54.680 --> 04:58.878
Where's my shotgun?
I'm gonna blow his freaking head off.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.840
Don't you think you're overreacting
just a little?

05:02.040 --> 05:05.396
Some bird chirps on my side
of the window every night for a week.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.194
Just because I want to pump
6 pounds of buckshot...

05:08.440 --> 05:11.159
...into its 3-ounce body,
I'm overreacting?

05:12.760 --> 05:16.275
I said we were sensitive, not sane.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.633
Woman, my aught-six.

05:19.880 --> 05:23.634
I don't have your aught-six anymore.
I gave it to the mailman.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.277
He was so depressed about losing
his job, I thought it might cheer him up.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.953
Well, what am I gonna do, Peg?
I can't sleep.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.991
That can be deadly
in my line of work.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.156
What if a fat woman tries
a pair of heels...

05:36.360 --> 05:39.557
...and I'm not alert enough to
shift my body before she topples?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.796
Amber, you're here.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.191
Didn't I warn you about this house?

05:48.400 --> 05:51.278
<i>Remember the story,
The Bundyville Horror?</i>

05:51.480 --> 05:53.630
This is the place.
These are the people.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.071
And this is the church
and this is the steeple.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.957
Marcie, despite your annoying flapping
of both lip and wing...

06:02.160 --> 06:03.878
...I'm glad you're here.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.389
I'm having a problem with birds.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.637
Perhaps you can speak to them
in their native tongue.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.390
They're keeping me up.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.790
What's their secret?

06:16.880 --> 06:19.713
They look the same as they did
in high school.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.274
Well, if you really want to scare them
away, an owl will usually do it.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.948
An Al? I'm an Al.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.836
An owl, you dolt. You know:

06:32.040 --> 06:33.314
What?

06:34.640 --> 06:36.676
- Not "huh."
- "Not huh," what?

06:36.880 --> 06:38.632
Not huh. Not what.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.558
Who, Al who?

06:40.840 --> 06:44.355
Not "Al who." Owl:

06:44.920 --> 06:46.956
Oh, an owl.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.231
Why didn't you say so?
I need to get me an owl.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.192
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.791
Al, either you're going to the zoo
at midnight, or come to bed.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.876
Well, since she put it that way,
to the zoo!

07:09.080 --> 07:10.354
Let's go, Amber.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.028
And I want you to take a shower
the minute we get home.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.954
Look, Amber, maybe we just got off
on the wrong foot.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.276
How about just a little kiss?

07:22.360 --> 07:25.955
We can settle in for some CNN.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.715
Okay, Bud.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.959
In a perverted sort of a way,
I kind of respect your opinion.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.311
So before I kill myself,
would you mind telling me...

07:39.520 --> 07:41.670
...is there anything that I'm good at?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.672
Kel, if there were anything--

07:43.880 --> 07:46.155
<i>I thought you were special.</i>

07:46.960 --> 07:50.430
--wrong with you,
I'd have told you long ago.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.392
Like, take your acting.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.833
You see, when I said you stink, I meant
you stink at choosing your roles.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.952
<i>You know, like anyone from
the Saturday Night Live cast.</i>

08:01.640 --> 08:06.555
Well, those who can, do.
Those who can't, do not.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.636
Yeah. Look, what I meant was, there
are much better jobs out there, Kel.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.876
For instance,
I was just dating this actress.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.152
Well, she plays topless
Lady Macbeth at the nudie bar.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.829
She happened to mention to me there's
a commercial audition for Fryer Tuck's.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.349
You know, the fast-food place
with the merry menu?

08:26.560 --> 08:28.915
I bet you I could get you an audition.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.515
Bud, you are an angel.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.472
I don't mean like someone
who died without ever having sex...

08:34.679 --> 08:36.193
...although I could.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.796
I mean an angel
who does good deeds.

08:41.679 --> 08:44.319
Why are you being so nice to me
all of a sudden?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.950
Well, I've matured.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.153
And I now realize there's a satisfaction
to be gained by helping others.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.869
Amber won't give you any, will she?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.193
No.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.513
Yup, Amber, I got Kelly an audition.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.029
And I am at my most sensitive.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.152
So I was thinking,
how about topless poetry in my room?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.879
Hello? Hello?

09:25.760 --> 09:29.799
Mom, can you tell me
something about love?

09:30.200 --> 09:36.230
Yeah. It's a many-splendored thing.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.436
Have you seen my toenail clippers?

09:39.400 --> 09:42.153
I mean,
what makes a woman want a guy?

09:42.360 --> 09:46.273
I mean, you actually wanted Dad
at one time, for some reason.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.113
Well, then you're not talking love,
you're talking hard liquor.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.795
Oh, Bud, I'm just kidding.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.436
There was a time when your father
was a very desirable man.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.912
Guess who.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.957
Now is not one of those times.

10:13.760 --> 10:18.436
Dad, tell me you didn't rent an owl suit
to sit in a tree and scare birds.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.631
I did not.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.036
I bought this baby.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.595
Talked him down to 400 bucks...

10:26.800 --> 10:29.473
...and he threw in
the night vision goggles. See?

10:31.000 --> 10:34.470
Now do you wonder
why I took my name off the mailbox?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.836
I almost got a live owl at the zoo...

10:37.040 --> 10:39.713
...but I found out something
very important last night.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.879
Never try to sneak past a rabbit hutch
with an owl in your pants.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.151
Even though they can't see,
they just know.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.793
Time to go to work.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.036
Honey, are you sure about this?

10:54.240 --> 10:56.913
Relax, Peg. The guy who sold it
to me gave me a guarantee.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.394
- Money-back?
- No.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.512
He just said it would work,
put a closed sign on and drove away.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.748
Hey, don't worry. I gave him a cheque.
It's not good or traceable or anything.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.559
Did you get the Fryer Tuck job?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.873
No, not yet.
It's down to me and another girl.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.752
But in order to get the commercial...

11:21.960 --> 11:24.110
...I have to learn how to shoot
a bow and arrow.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.072
You know, architecture?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.159
What am I going to do?

11:29.360 --> 11:32.272
The other girl is already
a good architect.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.997
How long do you have
before the callback?

11:35.240 --> 11:38.630
A week.
I can't learn to shoot in 10 days.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.197
Oh, Bud, will you help me, please?

11:45.480 --> 11:48.119
Oh, the things I do for love.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.038
Not you.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.634
Marcie's niece, what's-her-tush.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.276
Okay, let's begin.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.632
Okay, let's stop.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.398
Start over.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.750
Remember what the guy
in the archery store said?

12:20.080 --> 12:22.753
"Jump up and down
while I take these pictures"?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.988
After that. Remember?

12:28.200 --> 12:34.753
Look, feet apart, relax,
breathe slowly. Left arm, straight.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.632
Okay, no, you're way too low now.
Aim higher.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.909
Dad, before you get mad, just please try
to encourage her. She's just learning.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.798
Fine. I'll keep the bleeding internal.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.952
Thanks, Dad.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.955
Look, this is not gonna work.
I mean, let's face facts.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.151
If God wanted people to shoot a bow...

13:22.360 --> 13:24.999
...he wouldn't have invented
assault weapons.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.831
Look, that last shot wasn't your fault,
okay?

13:31.040 --> 13:33.634
No bird has a butt that big.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.755
- Now let's just try this again, all right?
- Okay.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.072
Just relax. All right?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.992
Will the arrow.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.270
Use the force.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.232
Told you.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.832
Relax, relax.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.838
Remember, there's nothing
to worry about. Okay?

13:58.080 --> 14:02.471
You just keep saying to yourself,
"I am an architect."

14:03.320 --> 14:04.878
Got it.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.392
- So where's your competition?
- Over there.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.357
Now, Kelly doesn't exactly have
to win this thing for me to score, right?

14:20.560 --> 14:25.350
Well, might as well introduce myself.
No sense in being a bad sport.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.470
Hi. I'm Kelly.
May the best girl win.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.433
Bull's-eye.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.670
What a quaint custom.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.872
Here's one my mom taught me.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.789
Hello, ladies.
How are my finalists today?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.592
- Fine, Mr. Tuck.
- Fine, Mr. Tuck.

14:46.800 --> 14:52.113
Oh, please, "mister" is so formal.
You can just call me "Sugar Daddy."

14:52.880 --> 14:55.758
Now, as you girls know,
you are so close in talent...

14:55.960 --> 15:00.909
...the only legal way to decide
who gets this role is with a shootout.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.519
You have any questions?

15:02.720 --> 15:06.759
- Actually--
- Good, then let's scoot and shoot.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.079
How do we know who goes first?

15:09.320 --> 15:12.471
I mean, should we flip a coin
or draw straws or--?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.116
How about if I go second?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.830
Okay. All right.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.395
Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is
the last shot of the competition...

16:48.600 --> 16:50.477
...and at the request of Miss Bundy...

16:50.680 --> 16:54.434
...we will now flip a coin
to see who goes first.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.391
Your turn, lame aim.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.750
Bud, I cannot beat that.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.348
Yes, you can. You can do anything.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.915
You're just saying that
to score with Amber.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.352
Yes, I am.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.272
But you can win this
and I'm gonna help you.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.913
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.872
You just tell me
what you want me to do.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.439
Okay.

17:30.640 --> 17:37.193
For my final shot, I am going to
shoot an apple off my brother's head.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.873
Now, wait, wait, wait a sec now.
I'm her brother.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.272
Kel, don't you think this apple thing
has been done to death?

17:49.480 --> 17:51.232
Not yet.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.630
Bud, I think it's so sexy,
what you're doing for your sister.

18:00.800 --> 18:06.033
How sexy do you think it is
on a scale of one to do-l-get-some?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.791
Let's do it.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.069
- Isn't Bud the greatest?
- Yeah.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.714
Damned if I'd do this for him.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.439
<i>What am I doing?</i>

18:21.640 --> 18:25.315
<i>Am I so desperate for sex
that I'd risk certain death?</i>

18:25.760 --> 18:28.513
<i>Why, yes. Yes, I would.</i>

18:28.760 --> 18:32.389
Okay. Stand still.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.828
<i>You know, I am really touched
that Bud is doing this.</i>

18:40.040 --> 18:41.473
<i>For the first time in my life...</i>

18:41.680 --> 18:44.797
<i>...it's like someone in my family
really believes in me.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:49.437
<i>God, I'm actually tearing up,
which is totally not good for Bud...</i>

18:49.640 --> 18:52.313
<i>...since now he's nothing but
a blur from here.</i>

18:54.080 --> 18:55.911
<i>Oh, what do I need to prove?</i>

18:56.120 --> 18:58.998
<i>Having a family on your side
has got to be more important...</i>

18:59.200 --> 19:01.839
<i>...than having some
fried-chicken typhoon...</i>

19:02.040 --> 19:05.237
<i>...telling me I'm finger-licking good
every morning.</i>

19:10.240 --> 19:13.755
I can't do this.
I don't need to be the Fryer Tuck girl.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.635
I'm just proud enough
to be that horndog's sister.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.590
<i>Thank you, God. Thank you.</i>

19:25.480 --> 19:27.914
I'm out of the contest.
The job's yours.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.349
Couldn't do it, could you?
Candy ass.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.268
Candy this.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.272
Yeah, that was pretty amazing.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.438
I haven't seen
an emerald-crested night thrush...

19:58.640 --> 20:01.359
...since I took bird-watching
in college.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.789
You know, to meet chicks.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.158
But when I heard
this little fella's distinctive call...

20:13.720 --> 20:15.711
...I knew I had to notify
the authorities.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.799
To think, in Al's yard,
two endangered thrush eggs.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.396
Well, I'm just glad they stopped him
before he could eat the other one.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.150
I am gonna miss him, though.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.511
Yeah, but it's not like you can't see him
whenever you want.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.599
Well, time to go watch Kelly
taping her Fryer Tuck's commercial.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.638
Will Bud be okay?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.354
Oh, sure. He's been changed.

20:50.440 --> 20:55.036
And besides, when is a turnip
ever really not okay?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.390
Bud, we're leaving.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.393
Mommy go. Daddy, tree.
Bud-Bud, sofa.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.910
Oh, isn't that cute? His first words.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.954
Soon, he'll be eating solid foods
and walking again.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.993
They do grow up fast, don't they?

21:26.640 --> 21:29.552
Bud, Aunt Marcie won't be back
for hours.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.591
I want you, bad.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.276
Girl. Yucky. Cooties.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.519
Men.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.631
<i>- Oh, well, it could be worse.
- Oh, well, it could be worse.</i>

21:45.840 --> 21:48.434
<i>- At least I'm not Dad.
- At least I'm not Bud.</i>
