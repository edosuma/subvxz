00:39.780 --> 00:42.301
I've done all sorts.
You name it, I've done it.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.900
Mostly building work.

00:44.939 --> 00:47.700
Ground work. Er... Drainage.

00:47.739 --> 00:49.739
Digging out, marking out.

00:50.421 --> 00:53.301
Concreting, roofing.

00:53.341 --> 00:55.860
Flooring, paving, flagging.

00:56.940 --> 00:58.940
Plumbing, joinery.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.820
I've even dug graves. I've done it all.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.301
So why'd you give it up?

01:04.340 --> 01:07.580
Well, there's always someone
on your back, isn't there?

01:07.619 --> 01:10.261
And after spending all that time
every winter on sites

01:10.301 --> 01:13.181
freezing your balls off,
well... it just gets a bit much.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.940
- What about the landscaping work?
- Yeah, I loved it. You know...

01:19.021 --> 01:21.380
Out and about.
Different customers every day,

01:21.421 --> 01:23.141
different houses, different jobs.

01:23.181 --> 01:25.301
You know, I'm a bit of a grafter
and that as well.

01:25.341 --> 01:29.660
It's just a shame the lads I was working
with weren't. A set of lazy bastards.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.940
So, erm... Yeah, I'd rather work
on my own now and be my own boss.

01:35.021 --> 01:37.101
- Have you ever been on the dole?
- No.

01:37.141 --> 01:41.181
No, no, no. I've got my pride.
I'd, er... I'd rather starve first.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.780
Music to my ears, Ricky.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.660
Henry was right. You are a trooper.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.141
Let's just get a few things straight
at the start, though, shall we?

01:50.181 --> 01:52.739
You don't get hired here.
You come on board.

01:53.261 --> 01:55.261
We like to call it on-boarding.

01:55.301 --> 01:58.021
You don't work for us. You work with us.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.860
You don't drive for us.
You perform services.

02:03.301 --> 02:06.940
There's no employment contracts.
There's no performance targets.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.979
You meet delivery standards.

02:09.860 --> 02:12.181
There's no wages, but fees.

02:13.141 --> 02:14.820
Is that clear?

02:14.861 --> 02:16.540
- Yeah.
- Clear?

02:16.580 --> 02:19.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It sounds all right, yeah. Good. Yeah.

02:19.820 --> 02:22.341
No clocking on - you become available.

02:22.980 --> 02:26.780
You sign up with us,
you become an owner driver franchisee.

02:26.820 --> 02:28.780
Master of your own destiny, Ricky.

02:28.820 --> 02:31.301
Sorts the fucking losers
from the warriors.

02:31.341 --> 02:32.940
- You up for that?
- Yeah.

02:32.980 --> 02:36.141
I've been waiting for
an opportunity like this for... ages.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.820
Just one more thing
before we go ahead with the franchise.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.940
You bringing your own van
or are you gonna hire with us?

02:44.700 --> 02:46.739
Erm...

02:46.780 --> 02:49.261
I'll have a word with Henry
if that's all right.

02:51.780 --> 02:56.301
Just let me know. Like everything
around here, Ricky, it's your choice.

03:11.432 --> 03:13.312
You've gotta think long-term, Ricky.

03:13.352 --> 03:15.671
If there's too much mileage
or it's battered to hell

03:15.712 --> 03:19.030
and you lose a day's work, then
you've got to pay for the replacement.

03:19.071 --> 03:21.871
That's a 200-quid
kick in the balls straightaway.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.671
That's why you've got to go for
something decent.

03:24.712 --> 03:26.312
I went for one of these.

03:26.352 --> 03:30.671
It's cos it's bigger, which means
I can get all the oversize parcels in.

03:30.712 --> 03:33.072
Flexibility - a bonus.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.871
But still small enough
that it doesn't affect your driving.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.271
I've been doing 24 hours straight
in one of these.

03:38.312 --> 03:40.312
Yeah, but it's 14 grand.

03:40.352 --> 03:42.231
Nah, Abby will have kittens.

03:42.271 --> 03:44.831
- We're still paying the loan off.
- Do the maths, right.

03:44.871 --> 03:47.831
A van like that's gonna cost you what?
£400 a month.

03:47.871 --> 03:51.592
If you hire one from the company,
that's 65 quid a day. Every day.

03:56.352 --> 03:59.472
You need to find yourself nigh on
a grand deposit for one of these vans.

03:59.512 --> 04:01.392
No chance.

04:42.711 --> 04:44.711
Liza Jane, you should be in bed.

04:44.791 --> 04:47.670
- I just couldn't sleep.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

04:48.512 --> 04:51.670
Sorry, the tuck-ins took
a little bit longer than usual.

04:51.711 --> 04:54.231
- Was it old Joe?
- Yeah, found him in the pub.

04:54.271 --> 04:56.031
- Get to bed.
- Why was he there?

04:56.072 --> 05:00.031
I'll tell you tomorrow, cos I'll try and
get home a bit earlier. I promise, OK?

05:00.072 --> 05:02.112
- OK.
- Come on.

05:02.951 --> 05:04.112
You read your book?

05:11.831 --> 05:16.231
It's £416 a month.
Can you not get a company van?

05:16.992 --> 05:20.951
They're £65 a day.
Which is two grand a month.

05:21.992 --> 05:23.992
Throwing money away like the rent.

05:24.031 --> 05:26.512
Yeah, but then you don't have the risks.

05:26.552 --> 05:29.312
Yeah, but 25 years driving
without a scratch.

05:29.352 --> 05:32.910
- Hm.
- Plus I'm guaranteed 155 quid a day.

05:34.312 --> 05:36.312
Henry's doing 200 quid a day.

05:36.352 --> 05:38.231
And I can be just as quick as him.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.992
That's £1200 a week, not a month.

05:41.031 --> 05:45.192
Yeah, but it'd be like
14 hours a day, six days a week.

05:45.231 --> 05:47.670
I never see you. We never see each other.

05:49.312 --> 05:53.072
Look... I know it's gonna be tough
at the start but...

05:55.271 --> 05:58.392
But, I mean,
after 12 months under my belt...

06:00.432 --> 06:02.192
...I can expand the franchise.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:04.352 --> 06:06.831
Look, I think we need to take the leap.

06:06.871 --> 06:10.031
Otherwise, we're gonna end up renting
for ever. We want our own place.

06:10.072 --> 06:13.031
I don't wanna live somewhere
where we're told how long we can stay

06:13.072 --> 06:15.072
or whether we need to move out.

06:16.472 --> 06:20.031
We need to find a £1000 deposit,
though, for the van.

06:20.072 --> 06:21.392
£1000?

06:21.432 --> 06:24.231
We're already up to our eyes in debt.

06:24.992 --> 06:27.112
The only thing we've got is my car.

06:29.271 --> 06:31.670
I... I can't get rid of my car.

06:31.711 --> 06:34.992
I can't sell it.
You know I need it for work.

06:35.031 --> 06:37.392
- Just get the bus.
- I can't.

06:37.432 --> 06:39.952
My clients, some of them live miles away.

06:39.992 --> 06:43.271
I need to be there at a certain time.
You know this.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.670
Abby, you're too soft.
Just go and do the mornings.

06:45.711 --> 06:48.711
Do the lunches, get back here
in the afternoon for the kids.

06:48.791 --> 06:51.072
- And I'll pick the slack up, Abby.
- I know you will.

06:51.112 --> 06:53.591
But it's nothing to do
with being soft, it's my job.

06:53.631 --> 06:55.432
Look, Abby, listen.

06:55.472 --> 06:58.831
In two years' time we'll have enough money
together to get our own place.

06:58.872 --> 07:00.992
We'll have the deposit for a mortgage.

07:03.352 --> 07:06.312
Oh, at last. I was gonna send
a search party out for you.

07:06.352 --> 07:08.231
- I've been out. Why?
- You're soaking.

07:08.271 --> 07:10.271
Why haven't you got your coat on?

07:11.831 --> 07:14.631
- What's all these letters on the table?
- We're just talking.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.831
Your dad's gonna start his own business.

07:16.872 --> 07:18.992
- Yeah, starting a franchise.
- Whoa.

07:19.031 --> 07:20.631
Taking over McDonald's?

07:21.591 --> 07:24.791
- No, you smartarse.
- No, he's gonna get a delivery van.

07:24.831 --> 07:26.911
- What colour?
- White.

07:26.952 --> 07:29.631
So you're gonna be a white van man?

07:29.670 --> 07:31.791
Yeah, if you like, yeah.

07:35.112 --> 07:37.112
Yo, Harpoon.

07:38.670 --> 07:40.670
Nowt much. What are you doing?

07:43.231 --> 07:45.392
Yeah, yeah.
Two seconds, mate. Two seconds.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.791
- Mam?
- Yeah?

07:46.832 --> 07:49.432
- Where's the cereal?
- Right in front of your eyes.

08:25.352 --> 08:27.872
Come on, let's get these parcels off.

08:28.952 --> 08:30.711
Come on.

08:44.030 --> 08:46.112
Is that your personal issue?

08:47.992 --> 08:49.952
I know it's your favourite.

08:56.031 --> 08:57.112
Morning.

08:57.152 --> 08:59.511
Come on,
we've got time to make up. Let's go.

09:01.231 --> 09:03.312
- All right?
- Yeah, not bad.

09:06.152 --> 09:07.872
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:20.471 --> 09:22.112
- All right?
- All right, Ricky?

09:22.152 --> 09:23.431
Yeah.

09:23.471 --> 09:25.312
This is the heartbeat of the depot.

09:25.352 --> 09:28.152
This is gonna be a scanner for you to use,
all right?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.551
It's precious and very expensive.

09:30.591 --> 09:32.670
You lose it, you pay for it.

09:32.712 --> 09:34.992
You look after it, it'll look after you.

09:35.631 --> 09:38.911
Once you scan a parcel into your van,
it's yours.

09:38.952 --> 09:42.712
It's in the system.
We can track it every inch of its journey

09:42.792 --> 09:44.792
from here to the doorstep.

09:44.832 --> 09:47.192
This thing even plans your route for you.

09:47.231 --> 09:49.152
- It's child's play.
- All right.

09:49.192 --> 09:50.952
But get this into your head.

09:50.992 --> 09:55.072
Precises: those are parcels that
have to be delivered at precise times.

09:55.112 --> 09:58.911
You get a one-hour time slot
to get them done and you don't miss them.

09:59.631 --> 10:00.792
Ever.

10:10.755 --> 10:13.635
How are we getting on?
You're doing great, all right?

10:13.675 --> 10:16.156
Now, just you remember
you've got to be a bit quicker.

10:16.196 --> 10:18.435
First in, last out. That's what it is.

10:18.475 --> 10:22.156
Get the order sorted now, it'll
save you a nervous breakdown later on.

10:22.196 --> 10:24.595
All right?
Now you've got to hit your ETAs.

10:24.635 --> 10:28.235
That's your estimated time of arrival.
It's all on your gun, right?

10:28.276 --> 10:29.795
- Right?
- Got any more questions?

10:29.835 --> 10:31.715
No, no, no. No. It's fine. It's all right.

10:31.755 --> 10:33.475
- I've got a question.
- What's that?

10:33.515 --> 10:35.795
When are you gonna get
these fucking parcels out?

10:35.835 --> 10:37.715
Hey. Less of your cheek, right?

10:37.755 --> 10:40.835
- You were a donkey for the first month.
- I know, I know, I know.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.350
Ignore him.
He couldn't kick shite along a gutter.

10:45.350 --> 10:47.990
He's a sub-contractor driver,
works for Big Sam.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.631
That's Sam's van.

10:49.671 --> 10:52.350
Sam gets £170 per route every day.

10:52.391 --> 10:54.270
So how much does he get for driving it?

10:54.311 --> 10:56.311
- 70 quid.
- Fucking hell.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.350
I'll tell you what, you do well today,
you'll get a better route.

10:59.391 --> 11:02.230
Come on, you two.
You've had the Q and As.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.590
Get that cardboard off that concrete.
Let's go!

11:07.949 --> 11:11.270
One more thing. And this is
the most important thing of all.

11:11.311 --> 11:13.311
- Yeah?
- You're gonna need this.

11:13.350 --> 11:15.791
- What's that for?
- That's for pissing in.

11:16.831 --> 11:18.710
- You're fucking winding me up.
- You'll see.

11:18.751 --> 11:20.751
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.791
Bastard.

12:02.391 --> 12:05.110
- Hello?
- I've got a parcel for Walrus Energy.

12:05.150 --> 12:08.070
- For who, sorry?
- Walrus Energy.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.590
- Oh, that's not for us, I'm afraid.
- Sorry?

12:10.631 --> 12:12.511
That's not for us.

12:12.551 --> 12:15.271
Why... Don't give me a ticket. Come on.

12:15.311 --> 12:17.949
It's your choice.
If you decide not to move on,

12:17.990 --> 12:20.710
- then I've got no option other than...
- No. You can't do...

12:20.751 --> 12:23.070
- You can't do that.
- Are you gonna move down?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.471
- I'm going there!
- You're gonna have to go down.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.671
I'm going there.
Why are you being so tight?

12:28.710 --> 12:30.551
I've given you the opportunity to move.

12:30.590 --> 12:33.791
Now if you don't move,
then you're gonna get a ticket, OK?

12:33.831 --> 12:35.831
- Thank you.
- Fuck you.

13:25.949 --> 13:27.949
Hi, Rosie. It's Abby.

13:27.990 --> 13:29.990
How are you?

13:35.791 --> 13:37.791
Rosie, where are you?

13:41.471 --> 13:43.471
You upstairs, Rosie?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.790
Rosie?

13:55.590 --> 13:57.590
Rosie?

13:58.590 --> 14:00.751
Rosie?

14:00.790 --> 14:03.350
Ah, sweetheart, is it hide and seek?

14:04.590 --> 14:06.590
Your hands are freezing.

14:06.631 --> 14:08.949
- Has he gone yet?
- Who?

14:09.590 --> 14:12.710
There's a strange man
going into my house.

14:13.590 --> 14:16.311
He's frightening me. He's frightening me.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.949
- He's going around.
- Oh, darling.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.790
Honestly,
it's just me and you in the house.

14:20.830 --> 14:22.830
- Are you sure?
- I'm... I promise you.

14:22.870 --> 14:25.750
- It's just me and you in the house.
- Just me and you?

14:25.790 --> 14:29.350
Come on.
How long have you been sat in here for?

14:29.391 --> 14:32.870
Oh, quite a while, I think.
I was frightened.

14:32.909 --> 14:35.111
- Oh, bless you.
- I was frightened. Strange men.

14:35.151 --> 14:38.471
- There's nobody in here, apart from me.
- OK.

14:40.790 --> 14:43.671
It's not a stranger, Rosie.
It's your new carer.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.350
Does all your meds and your tuck-in.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.391
You don't need to be scared.

14:57.311 --> 15:01.111
- Could I comb your hair, then?
- Oh, I haven't got time, Rosie.

15:02.350 --> 15:05.949
I've got to get you to have your
dinner and have your tablets, OK?

15:05.990 --> 15:07.990
Come on.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.870
Have a bit more of your dinner.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.949
Oh, Rosie!

15:12.990 --> 15:15.511
- I've broke the plate.
- Oh, man!

15:16.830 --> 15:18.391
I'm sorry.

15:18.471 --> 15:21.071
It's all right. Don't worry. It happens.

15:22.071 --> 15:26.590
Come on, I'm going to have to go
and get something to clear this all up.

16:03.191 --> 16:05.191
Got a parcel for you.

16:06.311 --> 16:08.909
Oh, aye. That will be my dinner, mate.
Cheers.

16:08.949 --> 16:12.311
Right. Well, it's, er... a bit heavy.
Do you want me to bring it in for you?

16:12.350 --> 16:15.111
Oh, mate, would you?
That's kind, mate. Cheers.

16:15.151 --> 16:16.949
- Thanks, mate.
- Yeah.

16:16.991 --> 16:19.391
- What you eating, an elephant?
- You cheeky git, man.

16:19.471 --> 16:22.111
I've been at my bloody Zumba,
that's what I've been doing.

17:16.670 --> 17:19.709
- All right, mate? Parcel for you there.
- Oh, cheers.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.310
Just give us a signature on that. Cheers.

17:22.349 --> 17:25.589
- What's that?
- United, mate. Man United.

17:25.630 --> 17:28.271
- Man United? Seriously?
- Yeah.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.311
- Aye.
- Why, man? Why not support a local team?

17:30.350 --> 17:32.191
Even Sunderland's better than that shite.

17:32.231 --> 17:34.031
It is my local team. I'm from Manchester.

17:34.071 --> 17:36.709
Bollocks, man. I've never seen
a Man U fan from Manchester.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.391
- They're all from bloody London.
- Come on.

17:39.471 --> 17:40.950
- Here you go.
- Ta.

17:40.991 --> 17:43.311
It must have been
a long and upsetting day for you.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.550
- What's that?
- When you think you've won the league.

17:45.589 --> 17:47.991
Seconds to go. Man City hanging on.

17:48.630 --> 17:52.111
Last kick of the game
Sergio Aguero pops up, wins the title.

17:52.151 --> 17:53.950
- Takes it out of your hands.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.950
They win the title, you win fuck all.
Must have been torture for you.

17:56.991 --> 17:59.311
It was fucking great.
I nearly pissed myself laughing.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.709
- What a day that was. Brilliant.
- Yeah. Funny, innit?

18:01.750 --> 18:03.271
- Aye.
- Not as funny as the time

18:03.311 --> 18:05.311
that you lot were 12 points clear,
though, eh?

18:05.350 --> 18:07.709
And you blew it.
Remember when Keegan went on telly

18:07.750 --> 18:09.991
with his little rant
after Fergie got in his head?

18:10.031 --> 18:11.950
"I'd love it.
I'd love it if we beat them."

18:11.991 --> 18:13.589
- Aye.
- Yeah. And we come up here

18:13.630 --> 18:15.271
and King Eric puts one past your lot.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.271
One nil. And who won the league?

18:17.311 --> 18:19.589
Us. Not fucking you. All right?

18:19.630 --> 18:22.709
Ooh-aah, Cantona, pal.
I'll see you in a bit. Enjoy your parcel.

18:22.750 --> 18:26.071
- Have a good day.
- Sunday October 20th, 1996.

18:26.111 --> 18:27.790
- We beat youse five nowt!
- Fuck off!

18:27.830 --> 18:30.589
And l fucking loved it. Loved it!
Fuck off, you wanker.

18:30.630 --> 18:32.630
You've won fuck all!

18:33.311 --> 18:36.031
Dick.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.510
It's all ready, Robert.
Just the way you like it.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.950
Thank you, Abby.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.750
How are you getting on?

19:31.709 --> 19:34.709
Ah, it's so sore, pet. So sore.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.670
Just take your time.
We'll get you freshened up.

19:39.709 --> 19:42.391
And put a clean pad on, all right?

19:42.470 --> 19:44.709
I never thought...

19:44.750 --> 19:48.871
I never thought this would happen to me,
you know. Not in a million years.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.630
- Well, we all get old.
- Aye.

19:52.831 --> 19:55.111
- Hey, Abby?
- Mm-hm?

19:55.151 --> 19:57.750
Did you hear about the dyslexic insomniac?

19:57.791 --> 19:59.470
No.

19:59.510 --> 20:02.470
He stayed awake all night
wondering if there was a dog.

20:14.617 --> 20:17.457
Hi, Liza. Just a quick one.

20:17.496 --> 20:21.175
Your pasta's in the fridge.
Heat it up in the microwave, OK?

20:21.936 --> 20:25.617
Leave your, erm... project out
and I'll look at it when I come in.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.136
Erm... 15 minutes on your computer,
that's it.

20:28.175 --> 20:30.295
I want all your homework done tonight.

20:30.337 --> 20:33.136
And get into bed for quarter to nine,
all right?

20:34.175 --> 20:36.737
I'm not sure when I'll be in.
I'll be as quick as I can.

20:36.777 --> 20:40.256
Your dad's gonna be in late, though.
But I'll see you later on, OK?

20:41.337 --> 20:43.457
Right. Love you loads. Right, bye.

20:44.337 --> 20:46.136
Bye.

20:51.337 --> 20:55.296
Seb, did you get my message?
I had a text from the school again.

20:56.175 --> 20:57.577
You need to ring us.

20:57.617 --> 21:00.657
I'm glad your... I'm glad
your dad's not getting these messages.

21:00.697 --> 21:01.935
I need to know where you are.

21:01.976 --> 21:04.657
Ring us now as soon as
you get this message. Bye.

22:13.617 --> 22:15.697
- What's that meant to be?
- It's a duck.

22:15.737 --> 22:17.935
- What do youse think?
- It looks like a chicken to me.

22:17.976 --> 22:20.377
- A chicken?
- It does. It looks like a chicken.

22:20.417 --> 22:23.337
But it's not a chicken, though.
You know what I mean?

22:23.935 --> 22:25.657
What's the purpose of it?

22:25.697 --> 22:28.657
It's our logo. It's our, like, sign.

22:28.697 --> 22:32.817
It's what we stand for, and it's what
people are gonna recognise us from.

22:32.856 --> 22:35.817
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I like it, but I can do it better.

22:35.856 --> 22:36.976
You can do better?

22:37.056 --> 22:38.935
- He's an idiot.
- Definitely.

22:38.976 --> 22:41.896
It's a bit deep
just for a bit of graffiti.

22:41.935 --> 22:45.136
Yeah, but, like, it means a lot to me,
you know what I mean?

22:47.175 --> 22:50.617
That's Harpoon. I mean, he's bright,
but he can piss me off sometimes.

22:50.657 --> 22:51.976
Why did you two come?

22:52.056 --> 22:54.935
I told you
I was gonna do it better than you.

22:55.217 --> 22:57.935
- Who's she?
- That's Roz. My close friend.

22:58.697 --> 23:02.176
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No, no, no. We're just good friends.

23:03.337 --> 23:06.496
That was a nice touch he added,
but obviously it's not my style, is it?

23:07.617 --> 23:09.657
Yee! How about that?

23:09.697 --> 23:12.377
So youse are gonna do that
every time youse do graffiti?

23:13.417 --> 23:14.816
Maybe.

23:59.577 --> 24:02.577
The lads are in Paddy Whelan's,
which has a handy breathalyser

24:02.617 --> 24:04.657
to measure just how drunk you're getting.

24:04.697 --> 24:07.337
Perfect for seeing
who's the lightweight of the group.

24:07.377 --> 24:09.617
The higher the number,
the more drunk you are.

24:12.137 --> 24:14.536
Gary is no stranger
to coming to Eastern Europe...

24:20.577 --> 24:23.337
- Have you seen the time?
- Just past half 11.

24:23.377 --> 24:27.457
Oh, God, we need to get to bed.

24:27.496 --> 24:30.097
Come and have a snuggle, cheeky chops.

24:35.935 --> 24:37.935
- You were snoring.
- Hm.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.457
It wasn't me, it was your mum.

24:40.496 --> 24:43.296
- It was your dad.
- It was your mum.

25:08.137 --> 25:09.776
- All right, bonny lad?
- How you doing?

25:09.816 --> 25:12.257
- Watch the match?
- I did, yeah. Three-nil.

25:12.296 --> 25:13.896
Good. Very good.

25:13.935 --> 25:16.217
Yeah, you did well.

25:31.176 --> 25:34.296
- You're late. Where's your van?
- It's parked outside.

25:35.296 --> 25:39.257
Three times this morning I phoned you.
Three times. No answer.

25:39.296 --> 25:42.296
Someone smacked into the mirror,
into my wing mirror.

25:42.337 --> 25:43.776
Clean off. On the floor.

25:43.816 --> 25:45.776
So why didn't you
bloody fix it last night?

25:45.816 --> 25:48.057
It happened outside the house
first thing this morning.

25:48.097 --> 25:50.176
What am I meant to do?
It's not my fault, is it?

25:50.217 --> 25:52.577
Well, get a replacement driver.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.577
Just give us two hours,
that's all I'm asking for.

25:55.617 --> 25:58.776
What good's that to me? Waiting
two fucking hours. You know the rules.

25:58.816 --> 26:01.377
You get down here first thing,
or you get a replacement.

26:01.417 --> 26:04.577
Howay, man!
I've worked 14 days in a row!

26:04.617 --> 26:08.457
Just give us a bit of slack.
Two hours! You never give us an inch.

26:08.496 --> 26:10.696
Because you're always bloody moaning.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.656
You're always on the phone
with some kind of feckin' excuse.

26:13.696 --> 26:16.097
And you missed three precises
last week as well.

26:16.137 --> 26:19.097
Aye, you know why.
You give us too many. You fucking know it!

26:19.137 --> 26:22.656
Well, I can sort that out for you.
I'll give your route to somebody else.

26:22.696 --> 26:26.137
Somebody who doesn't moan every two
minutes, who hits their fucking numbers.

26:26.176 --> 26:28.896
Aye, aye. Just like Stevie.
Squeeze us out, eh?

26:28.935 --> 26:30.377
Aye, same old story, man.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.935
Oh, you couldn't sell a black cat
to a fucking witch.

26:32.977 --> 26:34.816
- Drivers!
- Fucking twat.

26:34.856 --> 26:36.896
Yo, drivers!

26:37.417 --> 26:39.057
Front and centre.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.536
Come on, I haven't got all day.

26:46.257 --> 26:50.577
Right, there's a new route going.
Busier route and a bit of a challenge.

26:50.616 --> 26:55.137
But I need someone who is not gonna whinge
every two seconds like certain parties.

26:55.176 --> 26:56.977
Who's up for it?

26:57.057 --> 26:59.377
It's more money. More precises.

27:01.736 --> 27:04.417
Anyone? Carol?

27:05.776 --> 27:07.977
No, not me, mate.
Don't need the money.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.377
Les?

27:10.417 --> 27:12.776
Oh, our lass wouldn't be very happy, mate.

27:12.816 --> 27:17.257
Ricky? You've been racing around without
any fuss. Do you want a better route?

27:19.057 --> 27:21.097
- Take it.
- Cos he's fucking lost this route

27:21.137 --> 27:23.137
regardless of what happens.

27:24.656 --> 27:26.097
Yeah, all right, I'll do it.

27:26.137 --> 27:28.377
That's my boy. Right.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.576
You two, swap routes, swap details.

27:31.616 --> 27:35.936
And, you, if you don't like it,
you can fucking walk right now.

27:36.776 --> 27:38.536
Sort this shit out.

27:38.576 --> 27:40.816
Show's over! Back to work!

27:44.296 --> 27:46.656
- Let's go in the office, sort that out.
- Freddie, man.

27:46.696 --> 27:47.696
Come on, I'm sorry, mate.

27:47.736 --> 27:49.535
- What route you on?
- Fuck off, man.

27:49.576 --> 27:51.535
- Don't be like that.
- Oi! I told you two

27:51.576 --> 27:52.856
to sort your routes out!

27:52.897 --> 27:55.377
- Right. I'm 30. What route are you on?
- Fuck off!

27:55.417 --> 27:58.137
- You've got two seconds.
- What the fuck!

27:58.176 --> 28:00.057
Hey, man!

28:00.097 --> 28:03.377
- Freddie, man.
- Get him out! Get him out!

28:03.417 --> 28:06.377
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

28:06.417 --> 28:08.696
I'm fucking sick of this!

28:08.736 --> 28:11.137
- Get him out!
- All right, man!

28:11.176 --> 28:12.857
- Come on, Freddie, move.
- Freddie.

28:12.897 --> 28:15.417
- He's fucking tapped.
- He's doing it on purpose, man.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.535
- Look at him, man, he's crazy.
- All right, man.

28:19.576 --> 28:21.977
Get him out of my depot!

28:22.057 --> 28:23.696
- All right.
- We're sorting it, man.

28:23.736 --> 28:27.576
Sorting it! I'll sort the fucker.

28:35.457 --> 28:37.656
Right, Ben, get up, breakfast is ready.

28:38.495 --> 28:41.296
Please, leave me alone.

28:42.097 --> 28:44.377
You've gotta get up, Ben. Come on.

28:44.417 --> 28:48.057
What, so I can just stare
at these fuckin' walls again?

28:48.097 --> 28:51.897
What have I told you about swearing?
I'm not paid to be sweared at.

28:52.656 --> 28:55.495
- Come on, you've gotta get up.
- No, I'm not moving.

28:56.576 --> 29:01.456
I'm sick of sitting in my fuckin' chair
all day doing nothing.

29:01.495 --> 29:04.857
Look, I've got six other people
to go and see, man.

29:04.897 --> 29:07.456
I've gotta get them up,
get their breakfast.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.897
I haven't got time for this.

29:09.936 --> 29:14.495
Yeah, six people,
but yet you choose to wake me up first.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.616
- Oh.
- I'm fuckin' knackered, man.

29:16.656 --> 29:19.776
Right, I'll have a look on me timetable,

29:19.817 --> 29:22.176
- see what I can do.
- Yeah, you do that. Go on, yeah.

29:22.217 --> 29:23.696
Seeing as you're so pleasant.

29:23.736 --> 29:27.736
Yeah, sort me out
when all I have is nothing to do.

29:28.535 --> 29:29.696
Right.

29:32.057 --> 29:34.217
I've got a break in two hours.

29:35.377 --> 29:38.337
Get yourself sorted,
have another little bit of sleep,

29:38.377 --> 29:41.137
you might be in a better fettle
for when I return.

29:41.777 --> 29:43.777
It's a good job I like you, isn't it?

29:46.377 --> 29:48.576
I don't like you.

29:48.616 --> 29:50.616
Yes, you do.

29:53.535 --> 29:55.535
Come on, wake up.

29:56.817 --> 29:59.296
- What do you want, man?
- Howay, school.

30:00.535 --> 30:02.897
- Mum's already phoned.
- What you doing, man?

30:02.936 --> 30:05.857
- Mum's already phoned.
- Liza Jane, what you doing?

30:05.897 --> 30:08.656
- Mum phoned to see if you're awake.
- I literally don't care.

30:08.696 --> 30:11.857
Howay, Dad'll go mental
if you miss school again.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.377
I literally do not care.
And what you doing, man?

30:14.416 --> 30:15.897
- Come on.
- Stop it, then.

30:15.936 --> 30:17.656
- Just get up.
- Stop it, then.

30:17.696 --> 30:19.176
Stop being so lazy!

30:20.296 --> 30:22.897
- What, that's it?
- Is that it?

30:24.535 --> 30:25.897
- Roz?
- Yeah.

30:25.936 --> 30:28.495
Looks kind of small from here.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.376
Shut up. Wait until you get closer.

30:30.416 --> 30:32.656
- Is that it there?
- That's it.

30:40.495 --> 30:43.696
Are you mental, man?
High viz? They'll be on to us in no time.

30:43.737 --> 30:46.217
Well, that's the whole point.
Just wait and see.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.535
I... I divvent understand
what you're on about, man.

30:49.576 --> 30:52.495
- Just wait, man. Just wait. Jesus.
- Shut up, Dodge.

31:06.936 --> 31:09.416
That's an awkward way
of getting up then, innit.

31:09.456 --> 31:11.936
- Me hair's blowin'.
- Seb.

31:19.456 --> 31:20.777
- Seb.
- Yeah?

31:20.817 --> 31:22.817
Park authority.

31:22.857 --> 31:24.576
- Ah, shit, man.
- Yo!

31:25.616 --> 31:27.977
What the hell
do you think you're doing up there?

31:28.057 --> 31:30.817
You're taking the piss,
doing that in the middle of a school day.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.535
- Get down.
- It is school, sir.

31:32.576 --> 31:36.977
It's an outreach project with
The Open University and the police. OBK.

31:37.057 --> 31:39.416
OB... What's all that about, like?

31:39.456 --> 31:43.456
Out Back Krew. For disadvantaged kids
from under-privileged backgrounds.

31:43.495 --> 31:45.295
With learning disabilities.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.217
Is that a lass you got up there as well,
like?

31:47.257 --> 31:49.456
Hey, that's gender discrimination,
that is.

31:49.495 --> 31:52.817
- You should know better, man.
- Never mind your gender discrimination.

31:52.857 --> 31:55.336
If you lot are legit,
where's your supervisor?

31:55.376 --> 31:58.456
- She's not a supervisor, she's a, um...
- Curator.

31:58.495 --> 32:01.217
A curator. She's with Sergeant Johnson
down at the station.

32:01.257 --> 32:03.576
I mean, I've got her number
just in case you want it.

32:03.616 --> 32:05.697
Aye. Well, I'm not happy with you lot.

32:05.737 --> 32:07.857
I'm gonna be checking up on you.
I'll be back.

32:07.897 --> 32:09.857
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

32:09.897 --> 32:12.495
If you don't mind, could you go
and get me some red paint?

32:12.535 --> 32:14.657
But don't go out of your way.

32:15.285 --> 32:17.685
If you lot are taking the piss,
there'll be trouble.

32:17.725 --> 32:21.525
And you can stick your red paint
where the sun don't shine. I'll be back.

32:24.004 --> 32:25.805
- Red paint.
- Red paint.

32:25.844 --> 32:28.924
A curator. Nah, you're a genius, you.
You defo planned that out.

32:28.964 --> 32:32.365
I didn't, actually, but some pricks don't
see what's in front of them, do they...

32:32.405 --> 32:34.805
- Aye, it was all right...
- Well done.

32:35.883 --> 32:38.044
Right, so...
we need to get this done quickly

32:38.083 --> 32:40.445
cos we haven't got
that much time left, so...

32:50.910 --> 32:52.071
- Hello.
- Hi, mate.

32:52.110 --> 32:54.110
Can you take this parcel
for Mr Campbell?

32:54.150 --> 32:56.110
No, I'd rather not, mate.
He's a bastard.

32:56.150 --> 32:58.592
Keeps on parking
in me fuckin' parking space.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.712
Right.
But you'd be doing me a favour, mate,

33:00.752 --> 33:02.472
I don't get paid till they get delivered.

33:02.512 --> 33:03.831
Mate, he's a fuckin' wanker.

33:03.871 --> 33:06.592
Right, but, well,
can you not just sign for it?

33:07.871 --> 33:10.031
- Give it here.
- Cheers, man.

33:11.110 --> 33:13.110
Just there, please.

33:14.672 --> 33:16.831
Can I have your last name?
I can't read it.

33:16.871 --> 33:19.110
That's all you're gonna get, mate,
you know.

33:19.150 --> 33:21.910
- Yeah, but I need your last name.
- Big Data.

33:22.871 --> 33:25.352
- Big what?
- Big Data.

33:25.392 --> 33:28.871
It's when... when people start hoovering up

33:28.910 --> 33:31.831
all our personal information,

33:31.871 --> 33:34.192
and putting it in that black box.

33:35.192 --> 33:37.991
I tell you, I'll be getting brochures
for blow-up dolls next.

33:38.031 --> 33:39.831
- You know what I mean?
- Blow-up dolls?

33:39.871 --> 33:42.272
That's probably what this is.
I've been in his flat.

33:42.312 --> 33:45.151
There's stuff all over the shop.
He's a proper little pervert.

33:45.192 --> 33:46.312
Fucking hell.

33:46.352 --> 33:50.232
You can tell that by the way
he parks his car. Now fuck off.

33:50.272 --> 33:51.910
What the... Fucking hell...

34:03.272 --> 34:07.352
Would I be able to do the last OBK?
It's gonna be me last one.

34:07.392 --> 34:09.472
- What do you mean?
- I'm going to Blackpool.

34:09.512 --> 34:10.909
I've got me ticket booked.

34:10.951 --> 34:13.431
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah, I'm being serious.

34:14.712 --> 34:17.150
- Why do you have to go, man?
- It doesn't matter.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.071
- Just chuck it down when you get down.
- 'Scuse.

34:54.951 --> 34:56.951
I love these photos, Mollie.

34:57.951 --> 35:00.512
So many things going on in it.

35:00.551 --> 35:03.711
That's the Colliery Club
in the miners' strike, 1984,

35:03.751 --> 35:06.072
where we had our free caff.

35:06.111 --> 35:08.192
Do you know, we fed 500 a day.

35:10.432 --> 35:12.991
That woman there, very shocked.

35:13.031 --> 35:15.111
- That's me.
- It's not.

35:15.151 --> 35:17.072
Do you not recognise us?

35:17.111 --> 35:20.232
And this is Benny.
He was one of the union men.

35:20.272 --> 35:21.910
He'd just come in to tell us

35:21.951 --> 35:24.472
that there was another
two bus loads of pickets coming.

35:24.512 --> 35:26.192
And all of them wanted feeding.

35:26.232 --> 35:28.512
When he came in,
I went in the kitchen to tell them.

35:28.551 --> 35:30.672
God, if you'd heard the language.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.910
- Me mother included, mind.
- Yeah.

35:32.951 --> 35:35.151
But we did it.

35:35.192 --> 35:38.831
- Anyway, where's your photos?
- They're not as good as yours.

35:38.871 --> 35:42.312
Get away. They're family photos.
You should be proud of them.

35:43.831 --> 35:46.711
I've literally just grabbed them.

35:46.751 --> 35:50.551
Hey, I can see that.
You still got the frames on some of them.

35:51.751 --> 35:53.751
Let's have a look.

35:55.272 --> 35:58.072
- That's little Seb when he was five.
- Oh, he's canny.

35:58.111 --> 35:59.472
Mm-hm.

35:59.512 --> 36:03.472
- And look at you. You're blooming.
- Six months pregnant with Liza.

36:04.592 --> 36:06.472
Hey, is that your house?

36:06.512 --> 36:08.111
Should have been our house,

36:08.151 --> 36:10.992
but ten year ago
the Northern Rock crash happened.

36:11.032 --> 36:14.352
- Oh, yeah.
- We had the mortgage, everything ready.

36:14.392 --> 36:18.192
All gone through, and then Ricky
lost his job in the building trade.

36:19.072 --> 36:22.592
Couldn't get anything else. He's just
gone from job to job, and we've rented.

36:22.671 --> 36:24.871
Happened to a lot of people,
though, didn't it?

36:24.910 --> 36:27.751
- Oh, thousands.
- But happier photo.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.831
- Ah...
- There we are. Love's young dream.

36:29.871 --> 36:31.551
- Is that you two?
- Mm-hm.

36:32.671 --> 36:35.272
Met him at a rave in Morecambe.

36:36.432 --> 36:37.910
We'd go down on buses.

36:37.951 --> 36:41.392
He used to come up from Manchester
with his crappy little van.

36:43.192 --> 36:47.432
And this is my boy.
But he's getting so big.

36:47.472 --> 36:48.910
Eee...

36:48.951 --> 36:52.952
He's changing every day in front
of my eyes. That's when I see him.

36:52.992 --> 36:55.992
Aye. Have you no family round
to help you out?

36:56.032 --> 36:57.711
Me mam died three year ago.

36:58.952 --> 37:02.831
And Ricky's family
are all down in Manchester, so...

37:03.751 --> 37:05.352
- Eee...
- I need to run your bath.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.072
- I'll get in trouble for this, you know.
- Never.

37:08.111 --> 37:11.711
Yeah. Can't get friendly with the clients.
And I hate that word.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.111
What time's your next appointment, like?

37:14.151 --> 37:16.551
Well, I've got a two-hour break.

37:16.591 --> 37:18.871
- Let's have a look.
- So I can chat.

37:18.910 --> 37:21.992
- I hope they pay you, mind.
- Zero-hour contract.

37:22.032 --> 37:24.072
I get paid for the visits.

37:24.111 --> 37:27.352
- Well, what about your travelling time?
- I pay my own bus fare.

37:27.392 --> 37:29.392
Eee, God...

37:31.432 --> 37:35.711
Hey, I'm just looking at this.
7:30 in the mornings till nine at night?

37:35.751 --> 37:38.111
What happened to
the eight-hour day?

37:48.671 --> 37:51.072
- Have you got any water?
- I'm fine.

37:52.272 --> 37:55.512
I don't even know where Blackpool is
to be honest with you.

37:58.871 --> 38:00.871
Who are you gonna stay with, though?

38:01.911 --> 38:05.192
Friend of a friend.
She works in a guest house cleaning.

38:05.232 --> 38:07.911
She says I can stay there
until I get a job, so...

38:07.952 --> 38:09.472
There's loads down there.

38:09.512 --> 38:13.111
Madame Tussauds,
the fair, all the gift shops.

38:13.151 --> 38:15.352
I mean, it's better there
than what it is here.

38:15.392 --> 38:18.992
It probably is better than up here,
but why d'you have to go, man?

38:19.032 --> 38:21.392
Those three girls, they jumped us again.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.232
Pulled clumps out of me hair.

38:23.272 --> 38:25.751
They're bullies for life unless you move.

38:26.952 --> 38:28.511
But why would they do that to you?

38:28.550 --> 38:30.671
I don't know.
I guess I'm a little different.

38:30.711 --> 38:33.272
And me mum's new boyfriend,
he's a bully too.

38:33.312 --> 38:35.790
If it's not inside the house, it's out.

38:36.591 --> 38:39.352
- Have you at least got a sandwich?
- I'm not hungry.

38:39.392 --> 38:42.032
- I mean, I can go to Greggs right now...
- I'm not hungry.

38:42.072 --> 38:44.392
- Are you sure?
- I'll get something when I get off.

38:44.432 --> 38:47.272
- I think this is your bus.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

38:47.550 --> 38:49.192
That was quick.

38:49.232 --> 38:51.472
- Have you got everything, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:55.111 --> 38:57.952
- Look after yourself, yeah?
- I will. Always do.

39:27.151 --> 39:30.471
- How have you afforded all them?
- We all chipped in.

39:30.511 --> 39:33.911
- Oh, come on. Just tell the truth.
- I am.

39:33.952 --> 39:36.232
Seb, tell the truth.

39:36.272 --> 39:38.272
If I tell the truth,
Dad's gonna go bonkers.

39:38.312 --> 39:40.312
Just tell the truth.

39:43.272 --> 39:45.352
I sold my winter jacket.

39:45.392 --> 39:47.992
The Gore-Tex jacket?
Seb, for fuck's sake.

39:48.032 --> 39:50.032
Do you know how much it cost?

39:50.872 --> 39:52.952
That cost me a fortune.

39:52.992 --> 39:54.992
I can't get another one.

39:56.272 --> 39:57.550
What you doing?

39:57.591 --> 40:00.352
Have you been on the train tracks
and the roofs? Eh?

40:00.392 --> 40:02.511
Spreading that shite everywhere?

40:02.550 --> 40:06.111
Course it's shit, and of course
it's everywhere. It's advertising.

40:06.151 --> 40:08.791
It's like all the shitty advertising
you see nowadays.

40:08.832 --> 40:10.072
People trying to, like,

40:10.111 --> 40:12.791
them trying to get people
to buy stuff that isn't in their league.

40:12.832 --> 40:17.032
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Can we just talk? Instead of shouting.

40:17.711 --> 40:20.032
Have you been in school today?

40:20.072 --> 40:21.471
Oh, Seb.

40:21.511 --> 40:24.192
How many days off
have you had in the last month?

40:25.431 --> 40:28.272
Do you know, me and your mum
are gonna get dragged in?

40:28.312 --> 40:30.391
They sent a letter
about it last month, Seb.

40:30.431 --> 40:32.312
We're gonna get a fine, love.

40:32.352 --> 40:35.272
- Just talk.
- I know, but, love...

40:37.032 --> 40:39.911
I don't know what's got into you,
I really don't.

40:39.952 --> 40:44.752
You're a smart kid, just like Liza.
You used to be in all the top sets.

40:44.791 --> 40:49.591
What is going on?
Just give yourself some choices, mate.

40:50.832 --> 40:52.391
- Seb.
- Mm-hm.

40:52.431 --> 40:54.671
We've talked about this.
You could go to uni.

40:55.232 --> 40:57.591
Go to uni. What, and be like
Harpoon's brother?

40:57.671 --> 40:59.352
57 grand in debt.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.232
And what, working in a call centre now,

41:01.272 --> 41:04.712
getting smashed every weekend
just to forget his problems?

41:04.752 --> 41:06.032
Of course.

41:06.072 --> 41:09.471
Yeah, but it don't have to be like that,
does it? There's good jobs out there.

41:09.511 --> 41:11.431
Good jobs? What good jobs?

41:11.471 --> 41:15.712
Well, there is if you just knuckle down.
Give yourself some options.

41:16.712 --> 41:18.992
Otherwise,
you're just gonna end up like...

41:19.032 --> 41:20.872
- Well, I don't know...
- What, like you?

41:20.911 --> 41:22.752
Oh, fucking nice!

41:22.791 --> 41:25.232
- Seb.
- Do you really think I want that?

41:25.272 --> 41:27.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:28.550 --> 41:31.072
Well, yeah, of course I do, don't I?
I wanna be like you.

41:31.111 --> 41:34.351
Yeah, going from shit job to shit job,
working 14 hours a day,

41:34.391 --> 41:36.791
having to put up with
everyone else's shit.

41:36.832 --> 41:39.272
Going from one shit job
to another shit job.

41:39.312 --> 41:42.111
- You're just gonna end up a skivvy.
- A skivvy?

41:43.942 --> 41:46.462
It's your choice to be a skivvy, isn't it?

41:46.501 --> 41:49.142
A skivvy doesn't come to you,
you go to it.

41:50.262 --> 41:52.262
Right?

41:53.182 --> 41:54.382
I'm doing my best, Seb.

41:54.422 --> 41:56.740
Maybe your best isn't good enough,
is it?

41:58.142 --> 42:00.942
- No. It's not, is it?
- No.

42:01.981 --> 42:04.740
I want it better for you.
I want it better for Liza.

42:07.462 --> 42:09.462
D'you know what, fuck this.
I'm going to bed.

42:09.501 --> 42:10.981
- Go on, then.
- Yeah, fuck off.

42:11.022 --> 42:12.422
Fuck you.

42:15.862 --> 42:18.282
We do want the best for you, you know.

42:21.101 --> 42:24.022
He works so hard. I do.

42:24.062 --> 42:27.002
Where have you gone?
Can you not even look at me?

42:28.022 --> 42:30.501
I mean... I just can't.

42:30.541 --> 42:32.541
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

43:05.981 --> 43:07.981
Other way, Dad.

43:14.782 --> 43:17.621
This way, this way, this way, this way.
Here, here.

43:19.621 --> 43:21.382
Here, scan it, scan it!

43:21.421 --> 43:23.421
- Made it!
- Ah, yes!

43:23.942 --> 43:25.541
Have some of that.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.621
- Hello.
- Hiya.

43:28.661 --> 43:31.022
- Got a parcel for you, love. Cheers.
- Thank you.

43:31.062 --> 43:33.421
- Can you sign, please?
- Yes. Are you helping your dad?

43:33.461 --> 43:34.661
Yeah.

43:36.701 --> 43:39.062
- Thank you.
- Here, get yourself some sweets.

43:39.101 --> 43:40.942
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

43:40.981 --> 43:42.381
- Bye.
- See you. Bye-bye.

43:43.741 --> 43:46.581
- Ah, that's the third tip.
- Proper gold digger, you, aren't you?

43:46.621 --> 43:49.222
I never get any tips.

43:49.262 --> 43:52.262
Yeah, that's cos you're not as cute as me.

43:52.301 --> 43:54.461
Oh, you think so, do you?

43:55.954 --> 44:00.314
It can text, phone, photograph, scan,

44:00.355 --> 44:02.635
sign, contact the customer.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.154
- Anything else?
- Yeah, bleep.

44:05.194 --> 44:06.994
Does loads of bloody bleeping.

44:07.034 --> 44:10.034
I swear it bleeps if I'm out of the cab
for two minutes.

44:10.874 --> 44:13.314
Is that so the customer
knows where you are?

44:13.355 --> 44:15.515
Customer always knows where I am.

44:15.554 --> 44:19.914
They track every parcel, don't they?
To the front door and the back door.

44:19.954 --> 44:23.234
Even if you put one in the garden shed,
they know where it lands.

44:23.275 --> 44:27.194
Who puts all the information in there?
Somebody has to think about it.

44:28.034 --> 44:31.275
A robot or an... an app,
a computer program.

44:32.194 --> 44:33.874
But who feeds the robot?

44:33.913 --> 44:37.755
I don't know.
It's probably some specky geek, innit?

44:38.435 --> 44:40.435
Who never goes to the toilet.

44:42.114 --> 44:44.715
I mean, if they have time
to measure everything else,

44:44.755 --> 44:47.194
they might as well
have time for the toilet.

44:48.475 --> 44:50.355
Yeah.

44:50.435 --> 44:53.275
You didn't inherit
them brains from me, did you?

45:07.275 --> 45:09.913
You get the bell,
I'll get the parcel, love.

45:14.435 --> 45:16.235
Wargh.

45:26.074 --> 45:29.755
Well, it says leave it in the garden shed.
Fill that card in, love.

45:40.834 --> 45:42.994
Fucking hell!

45:43.715 --> 45:47.275
Fuck off, you fucking bastard!
Get to fuck!

45:47.595 --> 45:50.755
Fucking twat.

45:50.795 --> 45:53.195
Fuck's sake.

45:54.515 --> 45:56.554
There's a dog round there
with massive teeth.

45:56.595 --> 45:58.795
I think it's took a chunk out of my arse.

45:58.834 --> 46:00.834
Come on, hurry up with that card.

46:02.355 --> 46:06.554
You owe my dad

46:06.595 --> 46:11.074
a fresh pair of boxers.

46:18.314 --> 46:20.314
Are you having a laugh?

46:23.873 --> 46:27.314
I've been there over an hour and a half
cleaning her up

46:27.355 --> 46:30.595
because she had shit all over her hair,
under her nails.

46:30.635 --> 46:33.034
It was on the walls, all over me.

46:33.074 --> 46:35.235
I've... I'm covered in scratches off her.

46:35.275 --> 46:37.515
So what do you think?
What am I supposed to do?

46:37.554 --> 46:40.155
- Just leave her?
- I know... I know she's difficult.

46:40.195 --> 46:43.195
She's not a difficult, er... client.

46:43.235 --> 46:44.674
She's, she's very vulnerable

46:44.715 --> 46:47.074
and she needs more
than what she's getting, actually.

46:47.114 --> 46:49.314
And I've told you this
three times already.

46:49.355 --> 46:53.635
Nobody listens to us.
I'm just gonna give... make the call meself.

46:53.674 --> 46:55.954
Well, listen. Just calm down.

46:55.994 --> 46:59.435
Don't tell us to calm down!
Are you gonna pay us me extra hour?

46:59.475 --> 47:01.275
Well, you know I cannae do that, Abby.

47:01.314 --> 47:03.715
Yeah, but you still expect us
to clean up all the mess

47:03.754 --> 47:06.475
in the short space of time that we get.

47:06.515 --> 47:08.715
- That's how it is, isn't it?
- Well, the thing is,

47:08.754 --> 47:11.195
you know that I can't pay you,
you know that.

47:11.235 --> 47:14.074
Right. And don't bother
ringing her daughter.

47:14.115 --> 47:15.913
- No point.
- Well, we're gonna have to.

47:15.954 --> 47:19.115
There's no point in ringing her daughter,
she couldn't give a shit about her.

47:19.155 --> 47:22.235
She couldn't give a shit.
All she wants to do is sell the house.

47:22.275 --> 47:24.674
Right. Listen.
I've had two call-offs, Abby.

47:24.715 --> 47:28.715
I want you to do Mrs Sproat tonight for a
tuck-in because she keeps asking for you.

47:28.754 --> 47:32.635
Yes, I know. But tonight's my night
with my family and I've done extra today.

47:32.674 --> 47:36.595
So, no, I'm not doing it. I'm going.
I'll speak to you soon. Bye.

47:42.635 --> 47:44.435
Are you all right, love?

47:44.475 --> 47:47.554
No, I'm doing me bloody best.
I don't have enough time.

47:47.873 --> 47:51.754
I'm covered in scratches off
that poor old lady. She was frantic.

47:53.075 --> 47:55.075
I've got one rule.

47:55.635 --> 47:58.954
You... You treat them like your mam,
like, look after them.

47:59.873 --> 48:03.115
You wouldn't leave your mam
in a state like that. Nobody would.

48:05.275 --> 48:07.275
Here's the bus.

48:09.635 --> 48:13.195
- Are you getting on the bus, love?
- No, I'm just gonna kill some time here.

48:13.235 --> 48:15.873
OK, love. Take care.

48:41.913 --> 48:43.994
- I've got an idea.
- What?

48:45.355 --> 48:49.115
Why don't we get an Indian take-away
tonight, eh? Your mum's off.

48:49.155 --> 48:51.155
Yeah.

48:52.235 --> 48:55.235
- And pay for it with your tip money.
- No.

48:57.873 --> 48:59.873
Can you do us a favour and ring Seb?

49:01.235 --> 49:05.554
Ask him what he wants. And try
and persuade him to stay in if you can.

49:08.714 --> 49:11.673
Dad, I wish youse
didn't have to fight so much.

49:13.995 --> 49:15.995
Yeah, me too, love.

49:18.235 --> 49:19.954
Thanks for the great day.

49:19.995 --> 49:21.634
You're all right.

49:23.673 --> 49:26.035
Can we do it again?

49:26.075 --> 49:28.075
Yeah, course we can.

49:29.995 --> 49:32.995
There's the two-minute beep.

49:34.475 --> 49:36.475
It can wait, eh?

49:43.995 --> 49:45.995
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

49:49.035 --> 49:51.035
Thank you.

49:54.355 --> 49:56.314
- Dad?
- Yeah?

49:56.355 --> 49:58.873
You're right.
This is actually really nice, you know.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.714
- What's it called?
- Korma.

50:00.754 --> 50:03.115
- Is it?
- Yeah, it's for all the softies, that.

50:03.155 --> 50:04.794
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:05.475 --> 50:08.235
- This is where it's at. Vindaloo.
- Is it? Is it, really?

50:08.275 --> 50:10.035
Yeah, separates the men from the boys.

50:10.075 --> 50:13.475
You've gotta be hard to take this stuff,
d'you know what I mean, son?

50:13.515 --> 50:15.955
Fucking hell.

50:16.873 --> 50:20.435
- Separates the men from the boys, huh?
- Get a drink, love.

50:20.475 --> 50:22.475
All right?

50:26.075 --> 50:28.634
- Excuse me. No phones at the table.
- Sorry.

50:30.035 --> 50:32.235
What's the matter, love?

50:32.275 --> 50:35.155
It's Mollie, one of my old ladies.
She's been at a wedding.

50:35.195 --> 50:38.435
The taxi's took her home, and the
family thought the carer was coming.

50:38.475 --> 50:41.714
- Nobody's turned up.
- Why can't you ring the family?

50:41.754 --> 50:45.115
- Can't get hold of them.
- Is there no-one else on call?

50:46.115 --> 50:48.475
No-one's answering.
She's been stuck for three hours.

50:48.515 --> 50:52.035
She cannae get to the toilet or go to bed.
I'll have to go to her.

50:53.035 --> 50:56.435
- See, this is how the bastards do it.
- It's not right that, though.

50:56.475 --> 50:59.235
If I don't see to her, I won't sleep.
I'll get a taxi.

51:01.195 --> 51:04.115
No, look. You'll not get a taxi
on a Saturday night at this time.

51:04.155 --> 51:06.155
You'll be waiting for hours.

51:07.553 --> 51:09.634
Look, Dad, I've got an idea, yeah.

51:09.673 --> 51:11.955
How about we all just go in your van,
yeah?

51:11.995 --> 51:14.995
I mean, it might be a bit cramped,
but one of us will just double bunk.

51:15.035 --> 51:17.794
I mean, it'll be a laugh
cos we'll get there faster.

51:17.834 --> 51:20.355
We'll probably have, like,
a little sing-song.

51:20.435 --> 51:23.514
I divvent know, up to you.
I mean, it sounds like a good idea, right?

51:23.553 --> 51:25.754
I mean, is that OK with you, though?

51:25.794 --> 51:27.794
- Erm...
- Is it?

51:27.834 --> 51:29.435
- Yeah. Good.
- You sure?

51:29.475 --> 51:31.553
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

51:44.634 --> 51:46.474
♩ l tell you now my name,
my name is Young ♩

51:46.514 --> 51:48.673
♩ But so you think it's your destiny
to get the best of me ♩

51:48.714 --> 51:51.553
♩ But I suggest to be quiet, bro, don't
even try it from the east and west of me ♩

51:51.594 --> 51:53.435
♩ Takin' it and never breakin' it
or even shakin' it ♩

51:53.474 --> 51:55.435
♩ Groovin' it and always movin' it,
cos I'm not fakin' it ♩

51:55.474 --> 51:57.474
♩ Go for it, go for it, go for it! ♩

52:05.355 --> 52:07.435
Mollie, what's going on?

52:07.474 --> 52:11.435
Oh, Abby, am I pleased to see you.

52:11.474 --> 52:14.314
But I'm sorry to have to call you out
on a Saturday night.

52:14.355 --> 52:17.355
I don't mind at all.
How long have you been sat here?

52:17.435 --> 52:19.355
Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're here now.

52:19.435 --> 52:21.714
Oh, Mollie. You look beautiful, though.

52:21.754 --> 52:23.754
Did you have a little drink
at the wedding?

52:23.795 --> 52:27.275
I did. It was great.
But I came home, sat in this chair.

52:27.314 --> 52:29.474
Nobody to help us to the toilet.

52:29.514 --> 52:32.075
- So now I'm soaking wet.
- Right.

52:32.115 --> 52:34.355
Let's get you a nice bath run, eh?

52:34.434 --> 52:36.995
- That will be lovely. Thank you.
- Don't you worry.

52:38.474 --> 52:42.075
Do you know what?
It's so humiliating. I feel so stupid.

52:42.115 --> 52:43.914
I can't even get to the toilet on me own.

52:43.955 --> 52:46.355
Right. Come on. Look at me.

52:46.434 --> 52:49.914
And I want you to listen.
And don't ever forget this.

52:49.955 --> 52:52.835
You do more for me
than you'll ever know. All right?

52:52.874 --> 52:55.195
Well, I'm pleased
I can do something for somebody.

52:55.235 --> 52:57.115
You really do.

53:00.155 --> 53:03.155
They surprise you sometimes, don't they?

53:03.195 --> 53:07.075
But he's been so happy tonight.
We've had a right good laugh, haven't we?

53:07.115 --> 53:09.914
- Mm.
- Just his normal self.

53:11.155 --> 53:14.914
I'm really worried
he's gonna get kicked out of school.

53:14.955 --> 53:16.955
Yeah.

53:18.155 --> 53:20.155
I try and talk to him all the time but...

53:21.075 --> 53:24.275
...I just feel like I'm not here enough.

53:24.874 --> 53:28.594
Three nights a week's not enough.
I need to be here with my kids.

53:28.634 --> 53:30.594
- Oh, I know, love.
- I do.

53:30.634 --> 53:32.434
Oh.

53:35.874 --> 53:38.355
- Have you got chest rub on?
- No.

53:39.835 --> 53:43.195
I have to put it under my nose
in case there's a horrible smell...

53:43.235 --> 53:44.835
- Oh, thanks.
- ...when I'm at work.

53:44.874 --> 53:46.995
Oh, sorry.

53:49.075 --> 53:52.155
You know, I never thought
it would be this difficult, Abby.

53:52.195 --> 53:54.195
I know.

53:55.115 --> 53:58.755
It just seems to me
that everything's out of whack.

53:58.795 --> 54:01.155
- Mm-hm.
- You know what I mean?

54:01.195 --> 54:03.275
Yeah.

54:04.235 --> 54:06.474
I have horrible dreams, you know.

54:07.874 --> 54:10.354
I'm, like, sinking into quicksand

54:10.434 --> 54:13.354
and the kids are trying
to pull us out with a branch.

54:13.835 --> 54:18.275
But it just seems like the more we work
and the more hours we do,

54:18.314 --> 54:21.235
we just sink further and further
into this big hole.

54:22.075 --> 54:24.195
I have it all the time.

54:24.235 --> 54:27.313
Hey, come on.

54:30.313 --> 54:32.634
I just... I can't.

54:34.514 --> 54:36.914
I'd cry for a week, honestly.

54:39.674 --> 54:42.553
I'll put you on me to-do list
for tomorrow, though.

54:42.995 --> 54:45.235
- Top of the list.
- Right.

54:46.075 --> 54:48.075
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:09.313 --> 55:10.635
Hey, love.

55:10.674 --> 55:13.313
Ricky, there's an emergency meeting
tonight at the school.

55:13.354 --> 55:15.313
That's a bit short notice, innit?

55:15.354 --> 55:17.795
It's been organised last week.
Seb's hid the letter.

55:17.835 --> 55:22.955
Erm... the headmaster, the welfare officer
and his head of year want to see us.

55:24.635 --> 55:27.195
- What's the rush?
- He's had a fight on Friday.

55:27.235 --> 55:29.715
And the teacher's tried
to split it up and he's got hurt.

55:29.755 --> 55:32.795
So it's really serious.
We both need to be there.

55:32.835 --> 55:35.755
There's nothing I can do.
I can't get anyone to cover me.

55:35.795 --> 55:38.274
I know, but he could get suspended.

55:38.313 --> 55:41.795
Ah, fucking hell. Come on, mate.

55:42.474 --> 55:45.075
- Suspended?
- Who's that?

55:45.115 --> 55:47.635
Mr Davis, I've got a package for you.

55:47.674 --> 55:50.955
Can you have your photo ID ready, please?
It's your mobile phone.

56:01.035 --> 56:03.474
You're fucking having a laugh.

56:06.635 --> 56:09.354
Ricky, I'm really nervous.
The headmaster was so sharp.

56:09.434 --> 56:13.434
- And I said he wasn't listening to us...
- Abby, I've told you, I'll do me best.

56:13.474 --> 56:16.955
- I'm not going on my own. I need...
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Abby!

56:17.955 --> 56:19.354
Abby?

56:22.674 --> 56:25.274
- Have you got your photo ID, mate?
- I couldn't find any.

56:25.313 --> 56:27.955
- I need a passport or driving licence.
- Come on. Give us a break.

56:27.995 --> 56:30.955
- I can't. I need your ID.
- Come on, I've paid for it. Give it here.

56:30.995 --> 56:33.035
Look, I'm not bothered.
It's me job, in't it?

56:33.075 --> 56:36.354
It's cost us 200 quid. I've waited
three days for it. Just give it here.

56:36.434 --> 56:38.635
- I'm trying to be nice here.
- So am I!

56:38.674 --> 56:41.635
- Go and get your fucking ID now.
- Oi, just give us the fucking phone!

56:41.674 --> 56:43.715
Get the fuck off, you fucking dickhead!

56:43.755 --> 56:47.554
Go and get your fucking ID now, or I'll
ram your parcel down your fucking throat!

56:47.595 --> 56:50.274
- All right.
- Get it, you fucking dickhead!

56:52.047 --> 56:54.047
Liza Jane, something's come up.

56:54.087 --> 56:56.847
So Jessie's mam's gonna
take you to swimming, OK?

56:56.887 --> 56:58.567
Your stuff's in your sports bag.

56:58.606 --> 57:01.087
There's some pasta in the fridge
in the Tupperware.

57:01.127 --> 57:05.007
Do not go on the computer before
you do your, er... homework, please.

57:05.047 --> 57:08.966
Your permission slip for the trip's
in the envelope with the money.

57:09.007 --> 57:12.007
It's on the side.
So get that and I'll see you later on.

57:12.047 --> 57:14.087
Love you loads. Bye.

57:15.007 --> 57:18.167
Hi, Eddy, it's Abby.
I've got your prescription.

57:18.206 --> 57:21.406
I'm running 20 minutes late.
I'll not be long, OK?

57:22.767 --> 57:24.606
Seb, did you get my text?

57:24.647 --> 57:27.887
You really need to be at that meeting
tonight at the school, no excuses.

57:27.926 --> 57:29.926
Ring me back.

57:32.326 --> 57:34.647
Wrong address.

57:43.166 --> 57:45.606
Do you know,
I should work with Bill Gates.

57:46.726 --> 57:48.726
Er, what's the dance
with the new scanners?

57:48.767 --> 57:52.687
- You're hilarious.
- Aye. Aye, not long, aye.

57:53.567 --> 57:55.926
Right, that's me done now.
Thank you very much.

57:55.966 --> 57:58.286
- I shall see youse next week. Bye-bye.
- Cheers.

57:58.326 --> 57:59.887
- There you go.
- Everything OK?

57:59.926 --> 58:01.246
- Yeah, great.
- Any problems?

58:01.286 --> 58:02.567
No, nothing. It's fine.

58:02.606 --> 58:04.486
Have you got two minutes?
I need a quick word.

58:04.527 --> 58:06.527
I'm in a bit of a rush
to be honest with you.

58:06.567 --> 58:08.606
Aren't we all?
If you can just wait over there.

58:08.647 --> 58:10.647
I'll see to these two lads
and I'll be with you.

58:10.687 --> 58:13.047
- All right.
- Cheers, thanks.

58:13.087 --> 58:14.726
- Everything all right?
- Sound.

58:15.807 --> 58:18.047
- Any problems?
- No, no. No.

58:18.087 --> 58:21.527
Problems with this new battery.
Couldn't do me last scan.

58:21.567 --> 58:23.767
- You got your paper record?
- I'm on it now.

58:27.198 --> 58:29.598
It's all right, Ricky.
It's nothing to worry about.

58:29.638 --> 58:33.398
Hitting your figures and getting good
feedback, everything's going all right.

58:33.438 --> 58:36.677
Just... Did you have somebody in the van
with you on Saturday gone?

58:36.717 --> 58:39.598
Oh, yeah, it was...
it was me daughter, Liza Jane. Why?

58:39.638 --> 58:41.717
Oh, sorry, mate. We can't have that.

58:41.757 --> 58:46.198
Well, it's... it's my van.
My insurance. My daughter.

58:46.238 --> 58:47.877
I thought it was my business?

58:47.916 --> 58:50.038
Yeah, it is. But it's our franchise.

58:50.078 --> 58:52.318
All right? We had a complaint
from one of the clients.

58:52.358 --> 58:54.558
Nobody fucks with them, ever, mate.
All right?

58:54.598 --> 58:57.598
It's just one of the first commandments,
all right? Cheers.

59:07.358 --> 59:09.558
Mate, I've got a meeting
with me wife and me son.

59:09.598 --> 59:11.837
- What?
- I've got a meeting with the headmaster.

59:11.877 --> 59:14.118
I'm... I'm... I'm shutting up now, mate.

59:14.157 --> 59:16.358
- I...
- Right. Is there not another entrance?

59:16.398 --> 59:18.957
- They might still be in.
- The whole school's locked, mate.

59:19.038 --> 59:21.797
Sorry. The headmaster,
he went about 20, 25 minutes ago.

59:21.837 --> 59:24.118
- Sorry.
- Fucking hell.

59:31.477 --> 59:33.477
"I'm writing to inform you

59:33.517 --> 59:37.198
of my decision to exclude Sebastian
for a fixed period of 14 days,

59:37.877 --> 59:41.078
beginning October 15th,
ending October 29th.

59:42.717 --> 59:47.597
I realise that this exclusion may well be
upsetting for you and the whole family...

59:48.916 --> 59:52.517
...but there must be clear consequences
for violent behaviour.

59:55.078 --> 59:58.597
Your son is banned from being in any
public space during school hours

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.118
and should work from home."

01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:03.157
That's not gonna work, is it?

01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:10.717
Sebastian should work from home, using
an online learning programme called SAM,

01:00:10.757 --> 01:00:12.757
with log-in details below.

01:00:12.797 --> 01:00:15.477
Well, yeah. That's a fucking joke, innit?

01:00:16.477 --> 01:00:17.637
Eh?

01:00:18.677 --> 01:00:20.157
When Harpoon was suspended,

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:24.277
he could do his work from the school
library, supervised, is that right?

01:00:25.238 --> 01:00:27.238
Are you listening to me?

01:00:27.277 --> 01:00:29.277
Did you ask about that?

01:00:31.198 --> 01:00:35.078
I was too busy listening to him complain
about why you weren't there.

01:00:37.477 --> 01:00:40.438
There's no way he's gonna be doing
his work at home, is there?

01:00:40.477 --> 01:00:44.157
So we need to get it changed
so that he goes into school and does it.

01:00:45.358 --> 01:00:46.677
Abby!

01:00:47.717 --> 01:00:48.958
I don't know.

01:00:49.038 --> 01:00:51.398
It's common sense,
it's an obvious question.

01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:53.438
I can't believe you didn't ask it!

01:00:53.477 --> 01:00:55.477
Why don't you go and phone him, then?

01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:02.717
I can't believe you were face to face with
him and you didn't even bother to ask.

01:01:02.757 --> 01:01:06.917
I can't believe you didn't turn up
and ask the questions yourself!

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.318
I've been running around
like a blue-arsed fly all day!

01:01:09.358 --> 01:01:12.157
I've not even had anything to eat!

01:01:12.198 --> 01:01:14.198
Do you know how much work I've had on?

01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.318
- Blue-arsed fly?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.358 --> 01:01:20.358
Do you know what it is? Poor you!

01:01:20.398 --> 01:01:22.516
I never get my friggin' dinner any day.

01:01:22.557 --> 01:01:26.637
Do you know what? I've been stood in
bus stops all day. I've got no transport.

01:01:26.677 --> 01:01:29.277
I've got to travel around by buses
to do my job,

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:32.677
having people shout at me at bus stops
all friggin' day!

01:01:33.477 --> 01:01:37.978
And I can't get to fucking work
cos I don't have the car! Cos you sold it!

01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:40.438
I'm sick of youse.

01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:02.968
Do you know, the only time I ever argued
with your mum, and it's cos of you.

01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:05.528
Yeah, Dad.

01:02:05.566 --> 01:02:07.847
It's always my fault, innit? Always.

01:02:14.727 --> 01:02:18.528
♩ Last Saturday night I got married ♩

01:02:19.687 --> 01:02:23.606
♩ Me and my wife settled down ♩

01:02:24.128 --> 01:02:28.007
♩ Now me and my wife, we are parted ♩

01:02:28.968 --> 01:02:33.247
♩ Gonna take another show round town ♩

01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:35.767
♩ Irene ♩

01:02:36.527 --> 01:02:38.888
♩ Good night, Irene ♩

01:02:39.727 --> 01:02:41.727
♩ Irene ♩

01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:43.968
♩ Good night ♩

01:02:44.647 --> 01:02:46.968
♩ Good night, Irene ♩

01:02:47.566 --> 01:02:50.048
♩ Good night, Irene ♩

01:02:50.488 --> 01:02:56.128
♩ I'll see you in my dreams ♩

01:03:04.928 --> 01:03:07.168
I, erm... I just wanted a quick word.

01:03:07.928 --> 01:03:11.007
You know I'm a grafter
and there's no bullshit with me.

01:03:11.807 --> 01:03:16.487
But I'm just having some problems at home
at the minute with my teenage son. He's...

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:20.288
He's skipping school
and he's just on the warpath.

01:03:20.328 --> 01:03:22.727
But it's affecting everybody in the house.

01:03:22.767 --> 01:03:24.928
My daughter, Liza Jane, she's...

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:28.288
she's 11 and she's
not sleeping right and...

01:03:28.328 --> 01:03:30.328
My wife's up the wall with it.

01:03:31.247 --> 01:03:33.007
So, erm...

01:03:33.048 --> 01:03:35.048
Well, I just need a week off.

01:03:35.128 --> 01:03:39.647
I'm not finishing till late. It's gone
nine o'clock by the time I'm getting back.

01:03:39.687 --> 01:03:41.687
We're just all knackered.

01:03:43.447 --> 01:03:45.447
Why are you asking me?

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:48.447
Just get a replacement driver,
won't cost you a penny.

01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:50.487
It's your business. Remember?

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:52.168
Yeah, well, I've tried.

01:03:52.208 --> 01:03:54.208
I've already spoke to eight of my mates.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.928
But, erm...

01:03:55.968 --> 01:03:58.128
I can't get one until after Christmas.

01:03:58.928 --> 01:04:03.328
I've been speaking to the drivers as well
about us getting a driver between us

01:04:03.367 --> 01:04:05.288
and, you know, chipping in.

01:04:05.928 --> 01:04:08.968
But, erm... Well, it's not that easy.

01:04:09.007 --> 01:04:13.247
It's good you're using your initiative,
though. It shows planning ahead.

01:04:13.288 --> 01:04:14.687
Yeah.

01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:17.408
The thing is, though,
I could do with a week now.

01:04:17.447 --> 01:04:19.247
It's just, erm...

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.968
Abby, she, erm...

01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:23.447
Well, she's just really struggling again.

01:04:23.487 --> 01:04:25.647
I mean, even five days would be good.

01:04:26.727 --> 01:04:28.727
I had four drivers in here last week.

01:04:29.768 --> 01:04:33.407
First driver's sleeping on his mate's
couch cos his wife's kicked him out.

01:04:34.128 --> 01:04:36.328
Second driver, his sister had a stroke.

01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:40.888
Third driver, he's got fucking piles
and needs an operation.

01:04:41.566 --> 01:04:44.647
Fourth driver,
his daughter tried to commit suicide.

01:04:45.687 --> 01:04:47.687
I can go on.

01:04:47.727 --> 01:04:50.928
See, at some point,
every family is gonna have a problem.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:56.128
My old man was a farmer. He milked cows.
Do you think he got a day off?

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.128
Three days?

01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:03.366
You know, please, that'd... that'd do.

01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:09.366
Everyone in this building knows
I am "nasty bastard number one".

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:11.407
But I am greatly misunderstood.

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:16.328
All the complaints, the rage, the anger,
the hate, I soak it all up...

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:19.366
...and I use it as fuel.

01:05:19.407 --> 01:05:24.447
And with that energy, I create
a protective shield around this depot -

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:28.527
this depot, with the best performing
figures in the country bar none.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.968
Do you wanna know why I'm number one?

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.848
Cos I keep this happy.

01:05:38.128 --> 01:05:42.208
All the houses you go to, all the faces
you see, the people you speak to...

01:05:43.688 --> 01:05:46.566
...has anyone ever genuinely
asked you how you are?

01:05:47.407 --> 01:05:50.128
They couldn't give a shit
if you fall asleep at the wheel

01:05:50.168 --> 01:05:51.768
and go head on into a bus.

01:05:52.447 --> 01:05:56.968
All they care about is price, delivery
and the item in the hand.

01:05:57.728 --> 01:06:01.768
And all of that gets fed back
into this box.

01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:03.808
And this box is in competition

01:06:03.848 --> 01:06:06.968
with all of the other little black boxes
round the country.

01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:11.487
And it's that what decides the contracts.
This decides who lives and who dies.

01:06:12.128 --> 01:06:18.048
I want Apple, Amazon, Samsung, Zara,
here for my drivers and your families.

01:06:18.768 --> 01:06:22.968
This place might look like a shithole
but this depot's a fucking goldmine.

01:06:23.007 --> 01:06:27.128
The shareholders should erect a statue
in the car park of me, Maloney...

01:06:27.168 --> 01:06:29.688
patron saint of nasty bastards.

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:33.688
You want a day off?
It'll cost you fucking £100 a go.

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:12.607
Hello?

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:15.768
It is, yeah.

01:07:17.688 --> 01:07:20.688
Come on,
we've got time to make up, let's go.

01:07:23.487 --> 01:07:25.487
Are you winding me up?

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.208
Well, is he there? Can I speak to him?

01:07:39.607 --> 01:07:41.848
No. Yeah. No, I understand. Erm...

01:07:41.888 --> 01:07:44.246
Right, can you give me a minute?
I'll ring the wife.

01:07:44.287 --> 01:07:46.407
I'm in the middle of a shift here, so...

01:07:46.447 --> 01:07:48.527
I'll see if I can get her to come in.

01:07:48.567 --> 01:07:51.327
Right, cheers, thanks. Bye-bye.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:54.366
- What's the matter, mate?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.567
Fucking hell, Abby.

01:08:04.407 --> 01:08:06.007
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:09.007
That fucking dickhead.
He's been caught shoplifting in town.

01:08:09.048 --> 01:08:12.168
- You're joking?
- No, I've had the police on the phone.

01:08:13.128 --> 01:08:16.808
The copper's all right but said he needs
an adult there or he's gonna charge him.

01:08:16.848 --> 01:08:19.207
- Where's your lass?
- I'm trying to ring her now.

01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:21.246
Abby, pick up the phone!

01:08:21.287 --> 01:08:23.648
I can't have him getting
a criminal record.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.528
Hey, come on,
we've got time to make up. Let's go.

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:33.928
Abby, ring me straight
back, it's really urgent. OK, thanks, bye.

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:35.487
What you gonna do?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.528
Gonna ring him back.

01:08:49.006 --> 01:08:51.006
Hi, it's... it's Mr Turner.

01:08:52.607 --> 01:08:55.688
I've tried ringing my wife.
I can't get hold of her.

01:08:55.728 --> 01:08:57.167
So, erm...

01:08:57.207 --> 01:08:59.207
what's the situation?

01:09:03.407 --> 01:09:04.928
Yeah.

01:09:04.968 --> 01:09:06.768
Erm...

01:09:06.808 --> 01:09:08.768
I don't know what to do, mate.

01:09:08.808 --> 01:09:10.808
Well, you're gonna have to go.

01:09:10.848 --> 01:09:12.848
Right, OK, erm...

01:09:13.688 --> 01:09:17.488
Right, well, I'll come, then, if that's
OK. I'll be as quick as I can.

01:09:19.528 --> 01:09:21.488
OK, then, thanks. Cheers. Bye.

01:09:21.528 --> 01:09:22.607
Bye.

01:09:24.808 --> 01:09:26.567
Erm...

01:09:26.607 --> 01:09:28.447
Maloney, I'm gonna have to go.

01:09:29.006 --> 01:09:31.287
- What? You having a fucking laugh?
- No.

01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:35.366
How am I meant to get a replacement driver
now? I can't even share the parcels out.

01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:38.768
There's you and only Henry left.
Everyone else has fucking gone.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:41.968
I know, I'm sorry.
But it's... it's personal.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:43.528
Personal?

01:09:43.567 --> 01:09:45.567
Do I look like a fucking counsellor?

01:09:46.488 --> 01:09:50.488
Get those parcels out of your van
and that's you landed with a sanction.

01:09:50.528 --> 01:09:52.688
Fucking personal, my arse!

01:09:52.728 --> 01:09:54.407
For fuck's sake!

01:09:54.968 --> 01:09:57.648
You will pay through the fucking nose
for this.

01:10:02.808 --> 01:10:05.048
So in your favour you've been honest,

01:10:05.127 --> 01:10:07.366
you've held your hands up
and you've admitted it.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:09.488
Because of that,
we can see my mate out there

01:10:09.528 --> 01:10:12.488
and get this caution agreed and signed up,
all right?

01:10:12.528 --> 01:10:15.327
Then it'll go on to
the police national computer.

01:10:15.366 --> 01:10:17.207
So, is that a conviction?

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:18.768
It's not a conviction,

01:10:18.808 --> 01:10:22.047
but obviously if he gets into any more
bother, they'll be aware of it

01:10:22.127 --> 01:10:25.207
and they'll use it as evidence
of previous character, you know.

01:10:25.246 --> 01:10:27.246
Do you understand that, Seb?

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:31.968
Sebastian, do you understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

01:10:32.007 --> 01:10:33.688
Yes.

01:10:33.728 --> 01:10:36.768
Right, tell you what, let's start here
as we mean to go on, eh?

01:10:36.808 --> 01:10:38.808
Get yourself sat upright.

01:10:38.848 --> 01:10:40.928
Lift your head up and look me in the eyes.

01:10:40.968 --> 01:10:44.207
Let's do this properly.
This is a big moment for you.

01:10:44.648 --> 01:10:46.648
A big moment, young man, all right?

01:10:47.408 --> 01:10:49.888
Now, if you wanna carry on going
the way you're going on,

01:10:49.928 --> 01:10:52.528
there'll be nowt there but
misery and heartache for you.

01:10:52.567 --> 01:10:55.367
And not just you but for your folks
as well, all right?

01:10:55.408 --> 01:10:59.728
Alternatively, grab a hold of this chance,
this opportunity, that I'm giving you.

01:10:59.768 --> 01:11:03.207
Give your head a shake, get through
school, get a job, car, holiday -

01:11:03.246 --> 01:11:04.768
whatever it is you want to do.

01:11:04.808 --> 01:11:08.006
But then have the pride in knowing
that you've done that,

01:11:08.047 --> 01:11:09.968
you've paid for it, you've earned it.

01:11:10.006 --> 01:11:12.688
Because you've got
the best thing in life here.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:15.968
You've got a family that care about you,
that love you.

01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:20.367
You've got a father that runs away from
work to be here for you today

01:11:20.408 --> 01:11:23.928
and suffer this humiliating experience
that he's had to go through.

01:11:25.327 --> 01:11:28.207
I see it all the time, right?
And there's people don't have that.

01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:32.167
They don't have family that care for them
like that. And you've got it.

01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:34.207
It's massive, man.

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:36.768
So have a think about this, right?

01:11:36.808 --> 01:11:39.167
Take this on board for everybody's sakes.

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.287
Are you gonna do that?

01:11:42.488 --> 01:11:44.127
Yes.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.167
I hope so.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:55.528
This year's a really important year for
you, Seb. I hope you paid attention today.

01:11:55.567 --> 01:11:58.328
It's make or break for you,
you've got to stop messing about.

01:11:58.367 --> 01:12:00.367
Will you put your phone down!

01:12:00.408 --> 01:12:02.967
I'm listening.
It's just called multi-tasking.

01:12:03.006 --> 01:12:05.367
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- Bet you do.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:07.408
Seb, cut it out, please.

01:12:10.127 --> 01:12:12.127
- Put it down.
- All ears.

01:12:12.888 --> 01:12:14.528
I hope so.

01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:16.967
Do you understand what a conviction means?

01:12:17.006 --> 01:12:20.607
Fuck's sake, man! Lads out here nowadays,
stealing motorbikes,

01:12:20.648 --> 01:12:22.648
carrying knives, selling drugs.

01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:26.408
What, I lift three shitty cans of paint,
less than 15 quid?

01:12:26.448 --> 01:12:28.448
We don't steal in this family.

01:12:28.488 --> 01:12:30.607
It was a chain store, not a corner shop.

01:12:31.288 --> 01:12:33.288
Seb, that doesn't make it OK.

01:12:33.328 --> 01:12:34.967
What's gonna happen next?

01:12:35.006 --> 01:12:37.848
Do you know, every course you apply for,
every job you apply for,

01:12:37.888 --> 01:12:39.888
every form you ever fill in...

01:12:40.808 --> 01:12:43.047
Do you know how much you've cost us today?

01:12:43.688 --> 01:12:45.488
100 pound for a replacement driver,

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.967
plus a day off
and not to mention a sanction.

01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:51.528
You just don't give a shit, do you?

01:12:52.448 --> 01:12:55.006
- Put your phone down.
- Listen to your mother.

01:12:55.808 --> 01:12:57.808
Calm down, man. All this stress.

01:12:58.888 --> 01:13:01.247
Right, things are gonna change round here.

01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:03.648
First thing in the morning,
you're going to school,

01:13:03.688 --> 01:13:05.688
every day without exception.

01:13:05.728 --> 01:13:08.047
How are you gonna do that -
put me in a straitjacket?

01:13:08.127 --> 01:13:11.367
You are going to school -
cos I've had it up to here with you!

01:13:11.408 --> 01:13:13.127
Ah, I get it.

01:13:13.167 --> 01:13:16.408
Gonna wrap me up, put me in a parcel,
put me in the back of your van.

01:13:16.448 --> 01:13:17.927
What, special delivery?

01:13:17.967 --> 01:13:21.408
Right, that's it. You'll get your phone
back when you go to school.

01:13:21.448 --> 01:13:24.607
- Give us my phone! Give us my phone!
- Fucking warning you.

01:13:24.648 --> 01:13:25.808
Seb, Seb!

01:13:25.848 --> 01:13:28.367
I'm fucking warning you!

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:30.408
- Get back!
- Stop it!

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.448
Get out!

01:13:33.328 --> 01:13:37.328
Biggest mistake you've ever done in
your fucking life! You'll pay, I swear!

01:13:37.368 --> 01:13:38.707
Get out!

01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:43.907
All right.

01:13:45.846 --> 01:13:48.368
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:13:48.407 --> 01:13:50.048
It's OK.

01:13:50.087 --> 01:13:51.488
He'll come back.

01:13:54.408 --> 01:13:56.408
I don't believe him.

01:13:56.448 --> 01:13:58.448
It's OK, sweetheart.

01:14:11.249 --> 01:14:13.368
You need to wind it down, not wind it up.

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:15.408
So it's my fault, is it?

01:14:17.169 --> 01:14:21.368
He's skipping school and shoplifting
and he's cost us over 500 quid today.

01:14:21.408 --> 01:14:23.408
He's selfish, Abby.

01:14:23.448 --> 01:14:26.728
It's something else now.
It's gone beyond right or wrong.

01:14:27.689 --> 01:14:30.689
Bollocks - that's exactly what it is,
right or wrong.

01:14:30.728 --> 01:14:34.929
I've seen it with my friends' kids. We
need to keep communicating with him.

01:14:34.969 --> 01:14:37.528
We need to be together.
I'm not gonna lose him.

01:14:37.608 --> 01:14:42.009
No, we need to keep communicating with
each other. You should be backing me up.

01:14:42.048 --> 01:14:44.048
If you don't, then we're done for.

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:46.088
I do back you up.

01:14:46.129 --> 01:14:49.328
And we're done for if you don't watch
your temper. You're exhausted.

01:14:49.368 --> 01:14:51.288
Can you not see it?

01:14:51.328 --> 01:14:53.088
So it is my fucking fault?

01:14:53.728 --> 01:14:56.288
It will be your fault
if you can't control yourself.

01:14:56.328 --> 01:14:58.328
I had to split you up.

01:14:58.368 --> 01:15:00.288
I can't have that.

01:15:01.048 --> 01:15:03.009
I don't want it to be like my dad.

01:15:03.048 --> 01:15:06.048
That's a bit below the belt.
I'm fuck all like that old bastard.

01:15:06.088 --> 01:15:07.528
How can you even say that?

01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:11.288
When have you ever seen me
raise my hands to the kids? When?

01:15:11.328 --> 01:15:13.088
Look, you came so close.

01:15:13.649 --> 01:15:16.169
Once that line's crossed,
you can't go back.

01:15:16.209 --> 01:15:18.209
Can you not see it?

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:21.728
Did you not see it? He came at me,
it wasn't the other way round.

01:15:21.769 --> 01:15:23.969
I was in the middle of you.

01:15:24.009 --> 01:15:26.929
- Why are you blaming me, Abby?
- I'm not blaming you.

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:28.969
I'm not blaming you.

01:15:29.809 --> 01:15:31.848
It sounds like it to me.
And do you know what?

01:15:31.889 --> 01:15:35.169
If that's what you think, you can pack
your stuff and fuck off. I mean it.

01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:37.328
You're not listening to me.

01:15:37.368 --> 01:15:39.009
Stop it. Stop fighting.

01:15:39.048 --> 01:15:40.848
It's all right, I'll be in in a minute.

01:15:40.889 --> 01:15:42.889
You're not listening to me.

01:15:45.368 --> 01:15:48.769
You know how I feel about fighting
and arguing. I hate it.

01:15:50.649 --> 01:15:52.649
It's not my fault, Abby.

01:15:52.689 --> 01:15:54.689
You're exhausted.

01:15:56.129 --> 01:15:58.129
You need to just be careful.

01:15:59.408 --> 01:16:01.408
I'm coming, Liza.

01:16:37.487 --> 01:16:39.487
Abby, I'm really sorry.

01:16:41.048 --> 01:16:42.809
I didn't wanna say anything.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.649
Didn't wanna worry you
but she's wetting the bed.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:47.529
What, just now?

01:16:47.609 --> 01:16:50.889
No, but she's shaking. So I'm gonna sleep
in there with her tonight.

01:16:52.689 --> 01:16:54.689
I'm sorry as well.

01:16:54.728 --> 01:16:56.728
We need to get through this.

01:16:58.009 --> 01:17:00.009
I just don't know what to do, Abby.

01:17:00.653 --> 01:17:02.653
It's his phone.

01:17:04.574 --> 01:17:06.333
His homework's on there...

01:17:07.494 --> 01:17:10.693
...his paintings, the photos of them,
all of his friends.

01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:12.733
- Did you know that?
- No.

01:17:12.773 --> 01:17:14.773
It's his life.

01:17:15.853 --> 01:17:18.414
What are we gaining
by taking his phone away?

01:17:19.733 --> 01:17:21.733
Shall we give him his phone back?

01:17:23.414 --> 01:17:24.973
Thank you.

01:17:28.214 --> 01:17:30.214
I should go and look for him.

01:17:30.893 --> 01:17:32.973
He'll be at Harpoon's. I'll text him.

01:17:36.013 --> 01:17:37.614
- Abby?
- Yeah?

01:17:38.893 --> 01:17:40.893
What are we doing to each other, eh?

01:17:41.853 --> 01:17:43.494
I don't know.

01:17:44.692 --> 01:17:46.692
I really don't know.

01:19:03.853 --> 01:19:05.333
Abby?

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:07.214
- Yeah?
- Come here.

01:19:08.853 --> 01:19:10.853
- What's wrong?
- Just come here.

01:19:18.652 --> 01:19:21.254
- Who's done that?
- Who do you think's done that?

01:19:25.893 --> 01:19:27.893
Look at my pictures.

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:31.652
Yeah, the only one he's not done
is of you and Liza.

01:19:31.692 --> 01:19:33.692
So what does that tell you?

01:19:34.534 --> 01:19:36.534
Is his keys there?

01:19:36.574 --> 01:19:38.014
No.

01:19:39.093 --> 01:19:41.093
My van key's gone as well.

01:19:41.134 --> 01:19:42.613
Well, have a look.

01:19:45.692 --> 01:19:47.374
Is it there?

01:19:47.414 --> 01:19:49.414
Yeah, it's there.

01:19:49.453 --> 01:19:51.453
Check your coat.

01:19:53.494 --> 01:19:56.534
- I still need to find them.
- Check your coat, I'll check his room.

01:19:56.573 --> 01:19:58.934
If we don't find them,
I can't go to fucking work!

01:19:58.974 --> 01:20:01.014
Check your other coat in the living room.

01:20:01.054 --> 01:20:04.333
He's done this so I can't go to work,
Abby, I'm telling you.

01:20:04.374 --> 01:20:06.374
There's nothing in here.

01:20:09.974 --> 01:20:11.974
- Anything?
- No.

01:20:12.014 --> 01:20:13.573
Nothing.

01:20:13.613 --> 01:20:15.254
What am I gonna do?

01:20:15.294 --> 01:20:17.773
I can't ring Maloney after yesterday,
he'll go nuts.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.934
You know where Harpoon and Dodge live.

01:20:19.974 --> 01:20:22.573
- Look at the time, Abby.
- Take Seb's old bike.

01:20:22.613 --> 01:20:24.414
You'll get there in no time.

01:20:46.254 --> 01:20:48.374
...then take, on your way out of here...

01:20:48.414 --> 01:20:50.414
Go straight down the road.

01:20:50.453 --> 01:20:53.813
Then you need to take two lefts.
When you get down there...

01:20:53.854 --> 01:20:55.854
Hello, Maloney, it's Ricky.

01:20:57.214 --> 01:20:58.854
I've, erm...

01:20:58.894 --> 01:21:02.414
I've got a bit of a problem this morning,
I can't find the keys for my van.

01:21:03.254 --> 01:21:06.374
Look, that's two days in a row
you've fucked up my stats.

01:21:06.414 --> 01:21:09.974
You've jumped from being a blue-eyed boy
to a fucking arsehole.

01:21:10.014 --> 01:21:11.374
I know.

01:21:12.214 --> 01:21:14.813
"I know"?
Is that all you've got to say, "I know"?

01:21:14.854 --> 01:21:17.014
This is another £100 fine and a sanction.

01:21:17.054 --> 01:21:19.254
You get another one,
you're getting a red card.

01:21:58.374 --> 01:22:00.733
- Where's my van keys?
- Have you lost your keys?

01:22:00.773 --> 01:22:02.773
What a shame.

01:22:02.814 --> 01:22:04.613
Just give me the fucking van keys.

01:22:04.652 --> 01:22:07.452
- Give me my phone, then, innit?
- Give me the fucking van keys!

01:22:07.493 --> 01:22:10.452
I don't even know what you're on about,
you mental bastard!

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:14.214
You don't know what I'm on about? You've
been in and sprayed shit everywhere!

01:22:14.254 --> 01:22:17.093
You've took my fucking van keys!
I nearly lost my job today!

01:22:17.134 --> 01:22:19.093
I don't know what you're on about,
you pisshead!

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.774
You fucking little twat!

01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:23.814
- Fuck!
- Move.

01:22:23.854 --> 01:22:25.854
- Fuck's sake.
- Get out now!

01:22:25.894 --> 01:22:27.894
Get out!

01:22:29.413 --> 01:22:31.573
All right.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.134
Jesus.

01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:56.093
Hey!

01:23:08.452 --> 01:23:10.452
Hiya, Liza.

01:23:10.493 --> 01:23:12.493
Dad, can you come home now, please?

01:23:12.533 --> 01:23:14.533
I just...

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:16.373
I need a bit of time.

01:23:16.413 --> 01:23:18.413
Please come home now.

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:20.452
How's your brother?

01:23:20.493 --> 01:23:22.493
He's just left. He's fine.

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.894
Good.

01:23:24.934 --> 01:23:26.934
Please come home now.

01:23:30.974 --> 01:23:32.613
I'm sorry.

01:23:33.452 --> 01:23:35.214
It shouldn't...

01:23:35.254 --> 01:23:37.254
It shouldn't have happened but...

01:23:37.294 --> 01:23:39.613
Well, it's just one of them things, innit?

01:23:41.134 --> 01:23:43.693
Just... got out of hand.

01:23:46.774 --> 01:23:48.974
There's something I need to tell youse.

01:23:50.014 --> 01:23:51.573
What?

01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:56.734
The night when Seb came in
and he was spray-painting the pictures,

01:23:56.774 --> 01:23:58.774
I woke up and I heard him but...

01:23:58.814 --> 01:24:01.413
he was out of the door
before I could get there.

01:24:04.214 --> 01:24:06.332
I just wanted things the way they were.

01:24:06.373 --> 01:24:08.373
And I wanted Seb back.

01:24:09.894 --> 01:24:12.014
So I thought that if I took your keys...

01:24:13.734 --> 01:24:15.734
...things might go back to normal.

01:24:15.774 --> 01:24:17.774
Oh, darling.

01:24:28.413 --> 01:24:30.493
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

01:24:33.934 --> 01:24:35.934
It's not your fault.

01:24:47.533 --> 01:24:49.533
Well, I can go to work now.

01:24:49.573 --> 01:24:51.134
Eh?

01:24:54.413 --> 01:24:56.413
It's all right. It's all right, love.

01:24:56.452 --> 01:24:58.452
It's fine.

01:24:59.814 --> 01:25:01.814
Where's Seb?

01:25:02.452 --> 01:25:04.573
Oh, God, I owe him a really big apology.

01:25:04.614 --> 01:25:06.614
He's at Harpoon's, he's OK.

01:25:06.653 --> 01:25:08.653
I spoke to Harpoon's mam.

01:25:08.693 --> 01:25:11.413
He's gonna sleep there tonight. He's OK.

01:25:13.014 --> 01:25:15.014
I wanna tell him...

01:25:16.014 --> 01:25:18.014
...that it's my fault.

01:25:58.974 --> 01:26:01.093
Hey, stop!

01:26:01.934 --> 01:26:03.493
Oi!

01:26:56.332 --> 01:26:58.332
- Hiya, love.
- All right?

01:27:04.534 --> 01:27:06.093
Huh.

01:27:06.934 --> 01:27:08.934
- Look at all these mouths.
- Mm-hm.

01:27:12.534 --> 01:27:14.534
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:27:14.574 --> 01:27:16.373
These as well?

01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:18.054
Yeah.

01:27:19.253 --> 01:27:21.693
- Asking a lot of questions, innit?
- Mm-hm.

01:27:28.854 --> 01:27:30.854
There's a lot I don't know about him.

01:28:25.974 --> 01:28:27.534
Fuck!

01:28:28.614 --> 01:28:29.774
Argh!

01:28:30.453 --> 01:28:32.014
Get those phones!

01:28:32.053 --> 01:28:33.293
Argh!

01:28:33.332 --> 01:28:35.332
Come here, you cunt!

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:37.734
- Give up, you cunt!
- Argh!

01:28:37.774 --> 01:28:39.494
- You prick!
- Fuck him!

01:28:39.534 --> 01:28:42.373
Give me the fucking bag, man!
The fucking bag!

01:28:42.414 --> 01:28:43.854
- Go for it.
- Cunt!

01:28:46.574 --> 01:28:48.574
Fucking shit.

01:28:48.614 --> 01:28:51.213
- Here's your shit.
- You broke my fucking nose, man!

01:28:51.253 --> 01:28:53.014
- Come on!
- Wanker!

01:28:54.693 --> 01:28:56.332
Fucking wanker.

01:29:20.854 --> 01:29:23.293
Take a seat.
Somebody'll be with you soon.

01:29:23.332 --> 01:29:24.934
Thank you.

01:29:24.974 --> 01:29:26.974
Ayeshea Robson, please.

01:29:31.934 --> 01:29:33.934
Come on, Ayeshea.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:37.453
Stephen Baron?

01:29:41.213 --> 01:29:43.213
- It's all right.
- Sure?

01:29:53.774 --> 01:29:55.774
Nell McShane?

01:30:03.453 --> 01:30:05.453
I'm worried about your head and your ribs.

01:30:05.494 --> 01:30:07.494
Your eye's so swollen.

01:30:08.333 --> 01:30:10.333
It's all right. I can see fine, Abby.

01:30:11.133 --> 01:30:14.374
I think you've punctured your knuckles
as well, though.

01:30:15.294 --> 01:30:17.294
It were worth it. Fucking wankers.

01:30:18.973 --> 01:30:20.693
Did you pass out?

01:30:20.734 --> 01:30:22.253
No, why?

01:30:22.294 --> 01:30:24.294
Did you wet yourself?

01:30:24.774 --> 01:30:26.333
No, I, erm...

01:30:26.374 --> 01:30:28.534
I had a piss in a bottle
in the back of the van

01:30:28.574 --> 01:30:30.574
and they found it and threw it on me.

01:30:32.253 --> 01:30:33.774
I'm fine, Abby.

01:30:33.814 --> 01:30:35.933
Just go and find out how long
we're gonna be.

01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:38.333
I fucking hate it here. It's dead boring.

01:30:38.374 --> 01:30:40.374
I'd rather be at home. Go on.

01:30:40.414 --> 01:30:42.933
We're not going
without your X-ray results.

01:30:57.653 --> 01:30:59.734
- Sorry, what was the name?
- Turner.

01:31:01.614 --> 01:31:03.653
Right, I can see the X-ray result
is back,

01:31:03.693 --> 01:31:05.774
but it does need to be assessed by a GP.

01:31:16.973 --> 01:31:19.254
It's gonna be about three hours waiting.

01:31:19.294 --> 01:31:21.294
- Three fucking hours?
- I know.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.333
Jackie said she'll, erm...

01:31:23.374 --> 01:31:25.653
she'll have Liza Jane, so she's OK.

01:31:26.213 --> 01:31:27.774
Yeah. Have you spoken to Seb?

01:31:27.814 --> 01:31:30.414
Yeah, but he just froze.
I think he's in shock.

01:31:31.494 --> 01:31:32.774
Right.

01:31:34.453 --> 01:31:36.453
Will you get that?

01:31:37.414 --> 01:31:39.053
Derek Anderson?

01:31:39.092 --> 01:31:41.092
Oh, fucking hell, it's Maloney.

01:31:41.133 --> 01:31:43.133
Hello, Maloney.

01:31:43.214 --> 01:31:44.614
Are you OK?

01:31:44.653 --> 01:31:46.853
Yeah, I'm just waiting for some X-rays.

01:31:46.893 --> 01:31:48.973
All right, well, good luck with that.

01:31:49.013 --> 01:31:51.774
Er... what's happening
with the other parcels?

01:31:51.814 --> 01:31:54.893
Don't worry, they're safe.
Henry's picked the van up.

01:31:54.933 --> 01:31:57.294
I've been on the phone
to the insurance companies,

01:31:57.333 --> 01:31:59.534
and we're covered for all the phones...

01:31:59.574 --> 01:32:02.653
pretty much everything, in fact,
apart from the passports,

01:32:02.693 --> 01:32:05.214
and you had two of them, Ricky.
I'm sorry about that.

01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:07.254
Sorry about what?

01:32:07.294 --> 01:32:09.013
Well, the passports.

01:32:09.053 --> 01:32:11.653
It's £250 for each passport.

01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:13.734
It's a bit of a blow. It's 500 quid, mate.

01:32:14.893 --> 01:32:16.893
500 quid for two fucking passports?

01:32:16.933 --> 01:32:18.933
I can't believe it.

01:32:19.853 --> 01:32:22.414
Erm... have you got a replacement driver
for tomorrow?

01:32:22.453 --> 01:32:24.813
I've had the shit kicked out of me
and I'm in hospital

01:32:24.853 --> 01:32:26.933
and you ask
if I've got a replacement driver?

01:32:26.973 --> 01:32:29.414
I suppose you're gonna hit me
with another 100 quid fine?

01:32:29.453 --> 01:32:31.574
I'm sorry, but the stiff one's the gun.

01:32:31.614 --> 01:32:33.614
- The gun?
- What?

01:32:33.653 --> 01:32:36.534
The hand-held scanner.
Them dickheads smashed it up.

01:32:36.574 --> 01:32:38.013
Go on.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:40.133
Well, you know that's a grand, right?

01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:42.214
We can do instalments.

01:32:43.013 --> 01:32:45.494
A grand?
You're expecting me to pay £1,000?

01:32:45.534 --> 01:32:47.092
Are you having a laugh?

01:32:47.133 --> 01:32:49.614
- Hang on, Abby, don't.
- It's Ricky's wife, Abby.

01:32:49.653 --> 01:32:51.333
I'm sat in hospital with him.

01:32:51.374 --> 01:32:54.134
His face has been pummelled,
he's waiting for X-rays,

01:32:54.214 --> 01:32:55.734
he could have a punctured lung,

01:32:55.774 --> 01:32:57.973
they haven't even checked
his head injuries.

01:32:58.013 --> 01:33:00.893
And you're saying about fines
and £1,000 devices.

01:33:00.933 --> 01:33:02.653
Are you having a laugh?

01:33:02.693 --> 01:33:04.453
- Abby...
- Self-employed?

01:33:04.494 --> 01:33:07.013
How's he self-employed?
He's worked 14 hours a day,

01:33:07.053 --> 01:33:08.494
six days a week for youse.

01:33:08.534 --> 01:33:11.333
He works for you.
How's that self-employed?

01:33:11.374 --> 01:33:13.092
How do you get away with this?

01:33:13.134 --> 01:33:16.053
How does your company get away
with treating people like this?

01:33:16.092 --> 01:33:17.813
This is people's lives.

01:33:17.853 --> 01:33:21.734
This is my family and I'm telling you now,
don't fuck with my family.

01:33:21.773 --> 01:33:24.333
And fuck you, fuck your fucking device...

01:33:24.374 --> 01:33:27.254
and your fucking phone,
put it up your fucking arse!

01:33:27.294 --> 01:33:29.534
Abby, it's not the place. I'm sorry.

01:33:29.574 --> 01:33:31.254
I'm sorry, I don't swear.

01:33:31.294 --> 01:33:34.134
I'm really sorry.
I'm a carer and I care for people.

01:33:34.214 --> 01:33:36.053
And I'm really sorry. I don't swear.

01:33:36.093 --> 01:33:38.614
- Abby, just come on.
- I don't swear.

01:33:38.653 --> 01:33:40.214
Abby, get your bag.

01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:42.973
- I'm so sorry!
- I know. Just come on.

01:33:43.853 --> 01:33:45.853
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's all right.

01:33:48.494 --> 01:33:50.653
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, fine.

01:33:50.693 --> 01:33:52.973
- She's just...
- What about your X-ray results?

01:33:53.013 --> 01:33:55.733
It's fine. I'll come back tomorrow.
She's just a bit upset.

01:33:55.773 --> 01:33:57.773
I'll pop back in the morning,
if that's OK.

01:33:57.813 --> 01:34:00.733
I need to... She's had a bit of trauma.

01:34:17.813 --> 01:34:19.214
- Psst, Dad.
- What?

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:20.574
Are you OK?

01:34:21.574 --> 01:34:22.813
Yeah.

01:34:22.853 --> 01:34:24.853
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, Seb.

01:34:24.893 --> 01:34:26.893
Just a bit shaky.

01:34:26.933 --> 01:34:29.933
Can I get you anything,
like water or a cup of tea?

01:34:29.973 --> 01:34:32.453
No, I'm good, I've got some.

01:34:33.494 --> 01:34:35.692
No, but, Dad, man,
look at the state of you.

01:34:35.733 --> 01:34:37.733
Yeah, well, it's...

01:34:37.773 --> 01:34:40.494
- It's worse than it looks.
- You're a mess.

01:34:40.534 --> 01:34:42.254
Yeah, well...

01:34:42.294 --> 01:34:43.973
You know me.

01:34:44.013 --> 01:34:45.893
Strong in the arm, thick in the head.

01:34:48.214 --> 01:34:50.494
Are you sure
you don't need anything, though?

01:34:50.534 --> 01:34:52.534
No, I'm... I'm fine, thanks, son.

01:34:52.574 --> 01:34:55.453
All right. I'll be in the next room
just in case you need me, OK?

01:34:55.494 --> 01:34:57.494
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:34:58.733 --> 01:35:00.054
Seb?

01:35:01.692 --> 01:35:03.214
Yeah?

01:35:03.254 --> 01:35:05.254
It's really good to see you, son.

01:37:05.093 --> 01:37:07.093
Dad, where are you going?

01:37:09.214 --> 01:37:11.214
Wind down the window.

01:37:12.134 --> 01:37:13.414
Where are you going?

01:37:13.453 --> 01:37:16.773
Calm down, Seb. I'm just going
to the hospital for the X-ray results.

01:37:16.813 --> 01:37:18.934
At 6:30 in the morning? Are you stupid?

01:37:20.414 --> 01:37:22.453
I'll speak to you tonight when I get back.

01:37:22.494 --> 01:37:24.573
But what do you need
to speak to me about?

01:37:24.613 --> 01:37:28.054
We're thousands of pounds in debt, Seb.
I've got fines coming out of my arse.

01:37:28.093 --> 01:37:30.692
If I don't pay him and sort it out,
we'll end up on the streets.

01:37:30.733 --> 01:37:32.934
I'm not having that for you
and your mum and Liza.

01:37:32.974 --> 01:37:34.294
So let me go.

01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:37.093
You can't go like that, man, Dad.
Look at the state of you.

01:37:37.134 --> 01:37:39.014
You've only got one eye that works.

01:37:39.054 --> 01:37:41.533
You're gonna kill yourself
when you're driving.

01:37:42.134 --> 01:37:44.414
Son, I've got to go to work.

01:37:44.453 --> 01:37:46.453
I have not got a choice.

01:37:46.974 --> 01:37:49.333
Dad, I just want you back
the way you were,

01:37:49.374 --> 01:37:51.374
the way everything was.

01:37:52.414 --> 01:37:53.894
It's all I want.

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:56.934
It'll be different
in six months, I promise.

01:37:56.974 --> 01:37:59.894
- But how do you know that?
- Because I'll sort it out, I promise!

01:37:59.934 --> 01:38:01.692
Now, come on, I've got to go.

01:38:01.733 --> 01:38:04.093
- Dad, don't.
- Fuck's sake, Seb, I'm going to work.

01:38:04.134 --> 01:38:06.254
- I can't let you go!
- I've got to fucking go!

01:38:06.294 --> 01:38:07.974
- Move!
- No, Dad, don't go!

01:38:08.014 --> 01:38:09.613
- I'm going.
- What do you mean?

01:38:09.652 --> 01:38:11.573
- I've got to go!
- Get out of your van!

01:38:11.613 --> 01:38:13.692
- Jesus Christ!
- Get out of your van!

01:38:13.733 --> 01:38:15.254
Open the door.

01:38:15.294 --> 01:38:17.254
- I've got to go!
- Get out of your van.

01:38:17.294 --> 01:38:20.294
- I've got to go to work!
- Get out! You can't go to work.

01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:22.294
- I'm going to work!
- You can't go to work!

01:38:22.333 --> 01:38:25.054
- Let go of the fucking van!
- You can't go to work!

01:38:25.093 --> 01:38:27.093
Ricky, don't go to work!

01:38:52.533 --> 01:38:54.533
Come on.
