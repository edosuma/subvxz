WITH LEMON, TOO.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.469
- WHY CAN'T WE EAT?

09:01.610 --> 09:02.531
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT POLITE
TO START

09:02.680 --> 09:03.362
UNTIL EVERYONE'S AT THE TABLE.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.603

09:27.600 --> 09:29.170
IF HE WANTS FAST FOOD
HE CAN HAVE FAST FOOD.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.969
- HONEY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
HE'S JUST TESTING YOU.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.248

10:44.090 --> 10:47.674
LIKE AN--LIKE AN ABORTION?

10:47.810 --> 10:52.156

- MAX, WE'RE NOT REALLY SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT THAT AT DINNER.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.600
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.
- WELL, IT'S NOT DINNER YET.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.911
- OKAY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
LATER, OKAY?

17:44.060 --> 17:45.220
- THE INTERNET SAID THAT GIRLS

17:45.370 --> 17:46.120
BEGIN PUBERTY
AT THEIR FIRST MENSES.

17:46.270 --> 17:47.601
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- OOH.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.502
- BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
IT ALSO SAID THAT

17:49.650 --> 17:51.857
BOYS START
AT THEIR FIRST EJACULATION.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.206
- CORRECT.
- HEY.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.204
- OKAY, BUDDY--
- I HAVEN'T EJACULATED YET.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.341
- WELL--
- WELL, GIVE IT TIME.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.822
- YEAH, IT WON'T BE LONG.
[laughter]

17:56.970 --> 17:58.824
- IT SAYS THAT, UH--THE INTERNET
SAYS THAT WHEN I DO,

17:58.970 --> 18:01.416
I WILL BEGIN TO SEE GIRLS
IN A NEW AND EXCITING WAY.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.891
- BOY, THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.
- OH, WELL THAT'S--

18:03.040 --> 18:04.484
A WHOLE NEW WORLD IS GONNA
OPEN UP FOR YOU, MAX,

18:04.630 --> 18:05.790
BELIEVE YOU ME,
YOU START EJACULATING.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.669
- OH, MY GOD.
- DO YOU EJACULATE, GRANDPA?

18:07.810 --> 18:09.732
- NO, MAX!
- WHENEVER HE POSSIBLY CAN.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.733
- DO I EJACULATE?

18:10.880 --> 18:13.189
OH, MAN, DO I EVER.
I TELL YOU.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.877
- WHO LIKES PASTA?
THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

18:15.020 --> 18:18.433
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I SAW FOUR KIDS THROUGH PUBERTY,

18:18.580 --> 18:20.389
AND I CAN TELL YOU,
NOTHING'S APPROPRIATE.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.269
- WELL--
- YOU KNOW, THE KEY IS TO JUST

18:22.410 --> 18:23.980
ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S NORMAL,
BECAUSE IT IS.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.405
- HAVE YOU HAD A WET DREAM YET?
- WHAT'S A WET DREAM?

18:26.550 --> 18:27.756
IS THERE WATER INVOLVED?
- NO, NO, NO.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.585
A WET DREAM IS WHEN--
- YOU'RE SWEATING.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.894
- AND THE SHEETS ARE SLIPPERY--
- ADAM! FOLKS ARE HERE!

18:33.040 --> 18:34.860
[knock at door]

18:38.490 --> 18:40.037
- I'M OFFICER SPEER WITH
THE BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT.

18:40.180 --> 18:43.695
WE'RE RESPONDING TO A 911 CALL.
ARE YOU JULIA GRAHAM?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.569
- YES.
- WE'D LIKE TO COME IN AND TALK

18:45.710 --> 18:47.701
TO YOU ABOUT A REPORT
OF CHILD ABUSE.

18:52.990 --> 18:54.332
- I WILL, OF COURSE, BUT BOTH
OF MY KIDS ARE UPSTAIRS, SO--

18:54.470 --> 18:57.121
- MOMMY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.886
- UM, THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF
A MISUNDERSTANDING, SWEETIE,

19:00.030 --> 19:01.304
BUT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

19:01.450 --> 19:04.749
- MRS. GRAHAM, WE'LL NEED
TO TALK TO HER SEPARATELY.

19:04.900 --> 19:05.969
- RIGHT, OF COURSE.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.340
BABY, ONE OF THESE VERY NICE
POLICE OFFICERS

19:08.490 --> 19:09.866
IS GONNA TALK TO YOU, OKAY?

19:10.010 --> 19:11.034
- OKAY.
- MRS. GRAHAM,

19:11.180 --> 19:14.035
IS THE OTHER CHILD IN THE HOUSE?

19:14.180 --> 19:16.284
- UH-HUH.

19:21.950 --> 19:24.942
VICTOR, COULD YOU
COME DOWN HERE PLEASE?

19:27.990 --> 19:29.059
- HELLO!

19:29.200 --> 19:30.508
OH, GOOD, WE'RE ALL HERE.

19:30.650 --> 19:33.050
SOMEBODY BROUGHT SOME
CELEBRATORY CUPCAKES.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.610
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO PARTY?

19:34.750 --> 19:39.062
- THAT'S VERY SWEET, CROSBY,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT JOB.

19:39.210 --> 19:43.624
- YOU TURNED THE JOB DOWN?
- THE BENEFITS WEREN'T...

19:43.760 --> 19:45.170
- NO.
- WHAT SHE WAS HOPING FOR,

19:45.320 --> 19:46.412
AND THEY COULDN'T AGREE
ON VACATION TIME.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.936
- RENEE, I JUST--
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE

19:48.080 --> 19:49.479
THAT YOU WOULD TURN DOWN
A JOB IN THIS ECONOMY.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.689
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GROWING
ON TREES, RIGHT?

19:51.840 --> 19:52.943
- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
FOR HOURS.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.846
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- I'M NOT AN OLD SHOE.

19:56.980 --> 19:58.322
I CAN FIND A JOB.

19:58.470 --> 19:59.744
I CAN FIND A JOB.
- CUPCAKES ANYBODY?

19:59.880 --> 20:01.199
- I HOPE YOU CAN.
- IT'S OKAY.

20:01.330 --> 20:04.675
IT'S OBVIOUS THERE'S BEEN
NO ABUSE HERE.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.368
- I TOLD HIM IT'S A CRIME
TO MAKE A PHONY 911 CALL.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.738
I THINK I SCARED HIM
PRETTY BADLY.

20:08.890 --> 20:09.857
- GOOD.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.854
- BUT YOU'LL WANT TO TALK
TO HIM AS WELL.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.139
- YEAH. YEAH, THERE'LL BE
PLENTY OF TALKING.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.656
I'LL WALK YOU GUYS OUT.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.109
- LISTEN, BUG, CAN YOU DO ME
A FAVOR AND PUT ON YOUR JAMMIES?

20:18.250 --> 20:21.481
AND YOU CAN SLEEP IN OUR BED
JUST ONE NIGHT, OKAY?

20:21.630 --> 20:24.599
THANK YOU.
[door closes]

20:26.840 --> 20:29.809
- LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

20:37.060 --> 20:40.917
[door closes]
- SO WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW?

20:41.060 --> 20:42.925
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THIS RIGHT NOW.

20:43.060 --> 20:46.029
I WANT TO DEAL WITH
OUR TRAUMATIZED DAUGHTER.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.273
- OKAY, WELL WHAT ABOUT VICTOR?

20:47.410 --> 20:48.399
- YOU TUCK HIM IN.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.518
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM
RIGHT NOW.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.971
- HONEY.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.668
- WHAT?

21:04.810 --> 21:07.222
- HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU GOT YOUR FIRST BONER?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.600
- WHAT?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.468
- YOU KNOW, A STIFFY, HARD ON,
CHUBBY, WHATEVER.

21:10.610 --> 21:11.816
HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU GOT WOOD?

21:11.960 --> 21:12.915
- HONEY, WHAT THE HELL?
IS IT EVEN 6:00 YET?

21:13.060 --> 21:14.789
- I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS,
HONEY.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.434
HOW OLD WERE YOU?
IT JUST IS A QUESTION.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.957
- WELL, I--UM--

21:21.830 --> 21:23.229
I WAS AROUND MAX'S AGE,
I GUESS.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.587
- YOU KNOW, HE'S GONNA START
FEELING THINGS FOR GIRLS.

21:25.730 --> 21:27.379
- TELL YOU WHAT--
- AND SEXUAL FEELINGS, AND...

21:27.520 --> 21:28.509
- I KNOW.
- SO I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD

21:28.660 --> 21:29.558
HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.
I REALLY DO.

21:29.700 --> 21:30.837
- YOU THINK I SHOULD?
- YEAH.

21:30.970 --> 21:31.868
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A STAB AT IT TOGETHER

21:32.010 --> 21:33.659
AND SEE WHAT WE'RE DEALING
WITH HERE

21:33.800 --> 21:34.664
BEFORE I DIVE IN WITH
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES TALK...

21:34.810 --> 21:36.141
- WAIT A SECOND--NO WAY.
ADAM?

21:36.290 --> 21:37.427
- SOLO.
- REMEMBER WHEN I TALKED

21:37.570 --> 21:39.777
TO HADDIE?
YOU SENT ME IN ALONE, OKAY?

21:39.910 --> 21:41.423
- YEAH, HADDIE WAS EASY.
- GIRLS TALK TO GIRLS.

21:41.570 --> 21:43.538
BOYS TALK TO BOYS.
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE WAS EASY.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.956
- AND MAX WON'T BE.
- NO, HE WON'T.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.479
- IF YOU DECIDE
TO CONTINUE THE PREGNANCY,

21:49.610 --> 21:52.499
WE'D BE HAPPY TO REFER YOU
FOR PRENATAL CARE.

21:52.650 --> 21:55.335
OF COURSE THERE ARE RESOURCES
FOR TEEN MOMS

21:55.480 --> 21:56.959
WHO DECIDE TO RAISE A CHILD.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.864
ADOPTION IS ALSO AN OPTION

22:00.000 --> 22:01.069
[fading out]
FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.519
NOW, IF YOU DECIDE
TO END THE PREGNANCY,

22:03.660 --> 22:04.934
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS...

22:05.080 --> 22:09.801
[man humming]

22:09.940 --> 22:12.420
ANY QUESTIONS?

22:14.810 --> 22:18.018
- LATE IN THE NIGHT

22:18.160 --> 22:22.529
[students chattering
in background]

22:22.680 --> 22:24.955
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY...

22:25.100 --> 22:27.989
ONE OPTION, RIGHT?

22:28.130 --> 22:29.370
I MEAN, THE DOCTOR SAID
I COULD GET AN APPOINTMENT

22:29.520 --> 22:34.059
AS EARLY AS TOMORROW, SO--
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,

22:34.210 --> 22:37.247
SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE TIME,
THOUGH, TO THINK ABOUT IT.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.529
LIKE A WEEK, SHE SAID.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.072
- TO THINK ABOUT WHAT?

22:42.220 --> 22:43.869
- THAT'S NOT THE ONLY OPTION.

22:44.010 --> 22:48.709
- [sighs]
IF I HAVE THIS BABY,

22:48.850 --> 22:51.466
MY LIFE IS OVER.
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OVER.

22:51.610 --> 22:52.634
- YES.
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.156
- YES.
- WE COULD START A LIFE.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.291
YOU KNOW, I CAN GO TO COLLEGE.
I CAN GET A JOB, YOU KNOW?

22:56.440 --> 22:59.568
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT
WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP US.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.120
AND I LOVE YOU,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

23:05.310 --> 23:07.756
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA
SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.037
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

23:09.180 --> 23:13.037
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK,
BUT...

23:13.180 --> 23:15.171
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I'M NOT THERE FOR YOU

23:15.320 --> 23:18.733
IF YOU DECIDED TO KEEP IT,
THAT'S ALL.

23:22.710 --> 23:26.498
- I NEED HELP COMING UP
WITH THE MONEY.

23:28.330 --> 23:29.957
- OKAY.

23:42.350 --> 23:43.339
- HI.
- HEY.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.584
- GOOD MORNING.
- MORNING.

23:46.730 --> 23:49.790
OH, WENT TO THE WEIRD GUY?
- I-I HAD TO.

23:49.940 --> 23:50.907
- HE'S WORTH IT, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.244
- HOW'S DREW?

23:52.390 --> 23:55.041
- OH, GOOD.
UM, YEAH.

23:55.190 --> 23:59.399
TURNS OUT HE'S JUST VERY,
VERY STRESSED ABOUT COLLEGE

23:59.540 --> 24:01.496
AND EVERYTHING.
- RIGHT.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.868
BUT HE'S OKAY, RIGHT?

24:03.020 --> 24:05.602
- YEAH, BUT MARK WAS RIGHT
TO BE WORRIED, YOU KNOW?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.264
HE'S A VERY EMOTIONAL KID.

24:08.410 --> 24:10.787
CAN'T ALWAYS TELL--
- YEAH.

24:10.930 --> 24:12.955
YEAH, BUT HE'S FINE, RIGHT?
- TURNS OUT HE'S FINE.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.409
WHAT?
- NO, I MEAN--LOOK, HE--

24:15.550 --> 24:17.859
DREW'S STRESSED OUT, YEAH.
- YEAH.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.649
- 'CAUSE HE'S GONNA GO TO
COLLEGE AND THAT'S NORMAL.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.449
I WAS FREAKING OUT MYSELF AND--

24:21.590 --> 24:25.105
BUT MARK, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST KIND OF THINKING--

24:25.250 --> 24:27.935
I THINK HE PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED
TO COME OVER, RIGHT?

24:28.080 --> 24:31.561
- YOU THINK HE CAME TO SEE ME?

24:31.710 --> 24:33.189
- MAYBE, YEAH.
- AND WHAT--WHAT IF HE DID?

24:33.330 --> 24:34.706
- NO, I MEAN--
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS

24:34.850 --> 24:36.010
ABOUT THAT?
- I'M--I'M FINE.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.014
- NO, YOU'RE FINE.
YOU DON'T CARE, RIGHT?

24:38.160 --> 24:39.707
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
AM I--AM I JEALOUS

24:39.850 --> 24:40.839
THAT HE'S COMING AROUND?
- I'M JUST WONDERING.

24:40.990 --> 24:41.979
IT SEEMS
TO HAVE STUCK WITH YOU,

24:42.130 --> 24:44.644
SO I JUST WONDER
IF YOU HAD A FEELING?

24:44.790 --> 24:45.859
- I'M JUST NOTICING IT,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.786
AND I'M MAKING
AN OBSERVATION ABOUT IT.

24:47.930 --> 24:49.613
- I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU FOR THE OBSERVATION.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.034
- I NEED SOME SUGAR.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.649
- MM-HMM.
WELL, YOU CAN GET IT YOURSELF.

24:52.800 --> 24:57.078
- [chuckles]

24:57.210 --> 24:59.667
- SO FIRST OF ALL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE MONEY, OKAY?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.074
I'M GONNA GET IT FOR YOU.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

25:01.220 --> 25:03.074
- I'M SORRY THAT
I'M ASKING YOU FOR IT.

25:03.220 --> 25:06.428
- DREW, DON'T THINK ANY MORE
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

25:06.570 --> 25:09.607
HOW'S AMY?
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

25:09.740 --> 25:14.154
- NO, SHE'S...
SHE'S LIKE SHUT DOWN AND...

25:17.130 --> 25:20.258
I JUST FEEL SO STUPID,
YOU KNOW?

25:20.410 --> 25:22.787
LIKE IT'S MY FAULT, AND I--

25:22.930 --> 25:24.477
- DREW, IT HAPPENS.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.201
BUT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

25:26.350 --> 25:29.137
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

25:29.280 --> 25:32.169
- I JUST...

25:32.320 --> 25:33.526
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT,

25:33.670 --> 25:36.559
YOU KNOW?

25:36.700 --> 25:38.452
I DON'T KNOW.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.559
I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO, UM...

25:46.260 --> 25:48.774
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT UP, BUT...

25:48.920 --> 25:50.808
I'M TRYING TO RESPECT
HOW SHE FEELS.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.815
IT'S JUST HARD.
[snlfï¬es]

25:53.960 --> 25:56.895
- AMY'S GONNA BE FINE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.036
I'M SORRY.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.312
OH, DREW.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.251
[peaceful music]

26:59.720 --> 27:01.608
- AMY?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.753
- I'LL JUST BE OUT HERE.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.780
- VICTOR?

27:25.920 --> 27:27.945
WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU, BUD.

27:28.090 --> 27:29.603
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP THAT?

27:29.750 --> 27:32.218
THANK YOU.

27:32.370 --> 27:35.578
WHAT YOU DID,
CALLING THE POLICE,

27:35.720 --> 27:39.304
WAS SERIOUS.

27:46.970 --> 27:47.959
- LISTEN TO YOUR MOM.

27:48.110 --> 27:50.271
- SHE'S NOT MY MOM.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.393
[door opens, closes]

28:03.540 --> 28:06.748
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S MY WIFE.

28:06.890 --> 28:08.027
DON'T TALK TO HER THAT WAY.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.128
- WHATEVER.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET ARRESTED.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.680
- VICTOR, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU DID?

28:11.820 --> 28:13.879
YOU HAD THE POLICE
COME INTO OUR HOUSE.

28:14.030 --> 28:16.658
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

28:16.790 --> 28:19.486
IT REALLY HURT US.

28:19.620 --> 28:22.100
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.276
AND YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

28:33.950 --> 28:35.178
- ANYWAY, WHEN YOU'RE
TAKING A SHOWER,

28:35.330 --> 28:37.013
THOSE ARE THE AREAS
YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.196
AND I KNOW THAT THAT

28:39.330 --> 28:41.981
PROBABLY SEEMS A LITTLE, UH...

28:42.130 --> 28:45.611
STRANGE BUT, UH...

28:45.750 --> 28:47.547
I PROMISE YOU THAT
ALL THE BOYS IN YOUR CLASS,

28:47.690 --> 28:50.648
ALL THE BOYS YOUR AGE ARE
GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.

28:50.790 --> 28:54.135
IT'S JUST PART OF GROWING UP.
- NO, I DON'T FIND IT STRANGE.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.999
I MEAN, LIZARDS GROW
FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES,

28:57.140 --> 28:59.028
BUT THEIR SKIN DOESN'T,
IT STAYS SMALL.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.488
SO THEY HAVE TO SHED THEIR SKIN.

29:00.630 --> 29:02.769
AND MOST PEOPLE THINK
THAT'S WEIRD, BUT I DON'T.

29:05.670 --> 29:08.082
- I DON'T EITHER.

29:08.220 --> 29:10.802
I WANT TO STICK WITH PEOPLE
FOR A SECOND THOUGH, OKAY?

29:10.950 --> 29:12.838
BECAUSE ANOTHER PART
OF THIS PERIOD OF CHANGE

29:12.990 --> 29:16.744
HAS TO DO WITH YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT GIRLS.

29:19.790 --> 29:22.543
- YEAH, THE INTERNET SAID THAT
I WILL BEGIN TO SEE THEM

29:22.690 --> 29:24.920
IN A NEW AND EXCITING WAY.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.307
- WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

29:28.450 --> 29:30.486
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN WITH ME.

29:30.630 --> 29:34.100
- WELL, MAX, YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

29:34.250 --> 29:39.734
WHEN I JUST, UH...WELL,
A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN YOU,

29:39.880 --> 29:44.908
GIRLS WENT FROM BEING
JUST GIRLS TO...

29:45.050 --> 29:46.938
WELL, SOMETHING
NEW AND EXCITING.

29:47.090 --> 29:49.058
AND MYSTERIOUS.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.261
- BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU,
BECAUSE I HAVE ASPERGER'S.

29:54.440 --> 29:58.024
- THAT IS TRUE.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.853
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.377
SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME

30:02.520 --> 30:05.796
MAKING EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS,
BUT...

30:05.940 --> 30:08.249
THESE AREN'T
EMOTIONAL FEELINGS.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.427
THESE ARE SEXUAL FEELINGS, AND
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.549
YOU'RE GONNA SEE A GIRL--

30:12.700 --> 30:15.976
- DAD, I'M NOT READY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS YET.

30:22.260 --> 30:25.468
- OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

30:25.610 --> 30:29.853
WHEN YOU FEEL READY...

30:30.000 --> 30:32.161
IF YOU FEEL READY,

30:32.310 --> 30:35.302
JUST LET ME KNOW
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

30:35.450 --> 30:38.556
OKAY.

30:38.690 --> 30:39.861
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.979
- DAD.
- YEAH, BUD?

30:52.260 --> 30:54.672
- I WISH PEOPLE COULD SHED
THEIR SKINS LIKE LIZARDS.

30:54.810 --> 30:55.981
THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.464
- I THINK THAT WOULD
BE COOL, TOO.

31:03.550 --> 31:05.506
- YEP.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.964
- [slurps]

31:13.110 --> 31:15.169
- OKAY, HERE'S THE LAST OF IT.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.275
MM-HMM.
- THANK YOU.

31:16.420 --> 31:18.172
- UH-HUH.
YOU WANT SOME MORE CEREAL?

31:18.320 --> 31:19.526
- OH, NO, I'M GOOD.
THANK YOU.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.877
- ALL RIGHT.
CROSBY, ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T

31:22.010 --> 31:23.250
DO A LOAD FOR YOU?
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

31:23.390 --> 31:25.972
- NO, I ACTUALLY DO
MY OWN LAUNDRY, BUT THANK YOU.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.496
- THE MACHINE IN MY BUILDING
HAS BEEN OUT.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.224
- [laughs] YEAH, FOR FIVE YEARS.
BOY, GET OUT OF HERE.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.294
- YOU KNEW THAT?
[both laughing]

31:37.990 --> 31:39.639
- I GOTTA SAY,
THAT'S QUITE A SIGHT.

31:39.790 --> 31:42.645
A GROWN-ASS MAN HAVING HIS
LAUNDRY FOLDED BY HIS MOTHER.

31:42.790 --> 31:44.439
- I REMEMBER MY SISTER
TELLING ME THAT YOUR MOTHER

31:44.590 --> 31:46.615
DID YOUR LAUNDRY
UNTIL YOU BOUGHT THIS HOUSE.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.341
- OH, DID SHE SAY THAT?
- SHE SURE DID.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.718
- YEAH, BIG DIFFERENCE THOUGH.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.906
I LIVED ON A BOAT,
SO IT WASN'T REALLY AN OPTION.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.283
- DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE CEREAL
BY ANY CHANCE?

31:55.430 --> 31:57.660
- NO, I THINK YOU ATE IT ALL,
ACTUALLY.

32:01.810 --> 32:05.940
- LADY ADELAIDE

32:06.090 --> 32:09.400
SHOWS NO EMOTION

32:09.540 --> 32:12.122
COLDER THAN A WAVE

32:12.270 --> 32:15.785
IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN

32:15.930 --> 32:18.444
SHE WAITED ALL HER YEARS

32:18.590 --> 32:21.445
[engine turns off]
- THANKS FOR DRIVING ME.

32:21.590 --> 32:24.241
- YEAH, UM...

32:24.390 --> 32:26.312
I'LL JUST CALL YOU LATER?

32:31.840 --> 32:33.831
- MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.949
I NEED SOME SPACE.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.224
- OKAY.
HOW MUCH SPACE?

32:43.650 --> 32:48.121
- [sighs]
A LOT.

32:48.270 --> 32:52.513
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

32:56.070 --> 33:00.006
- OKAY, WELL, MY DAD'S HOME,
SO...

33:00.150 --> 33:03.972
DO I LOOK OKAY?
DO I LOOK NORMAL?

33:05.740 --> 33:07.799
- YEAH, UM...

33:07.950 --> 33:10.669
YOU LOOK REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.748
- LADY ADELAIDE

33:15.890 --> 33:19.189
SHOWS NO EMOTION

33:19.340 --> 33:22.127
COLDER THAN A WAVE

33:22.270 --> 33:25.785
IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN

33:25.930 --> 33:29.309
SHE WAITED ALL HER YEARS

33:29.450 --> 33:32.578
FOR THOSE THREE WORDS

33:32.730 --> 33:34.174
THAT NEVER REACH ED
HER EARS

33:34.320 --> 33:35.935
[engine starts]

33:36.080 --> 33:41.256
THEY JUST WENT UNHEARD

33:43.880 --> 33:46.735
[jazz music]

33:46.880 --> 33:52.193
- FISH IN THE SEA

33:52.340 --> 33:56.128
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL

33:56.270 --> 33:57.783
BLOSSOM ON THE TREE

33:57.930 --> 34:01.309
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL

34:01.450 --> 34:04.237
IT'S A NEW DAWN,
IT'S A NEW DAY

34:04.380 --> 34:07.383
IT'S A NEW LIFE
FOR ME...

34:07.520 --> 34:08.760
- [sniffs]
YOU SMELL GOOD.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.140
- THAT'S BECAUSE I WASHED
MY ARMPITS, MY BUTT,

34:10.280 --> 34:12.931
AND MY BALLS WITH SOAP,
LIKE DAD SAID.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.116
[laughter]

34:15.260 --> 34:16.875
- WHAT DID YOU TWO--
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

34:17.020 --> 34:18.590
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING GOT THROUGH.

34:18.740 --> 34:19.775
- YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.

34:19.910 --> 34:21.116
I MEAN, HE SHOWERED.
IT'S AWESOME.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.488
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

34:22.640 --> 34:25.700
- I HAD THE TALK WITH HIM.
- OKAY, HOW DID IT GO?

34:25.850 --> 34:27.363
- GOOD.
- YOU'RE NOT CONVINCING ME.

34:27.510 --> 34:31.162
- WELL, IT WAS WEIRD.
- WEIRD HOW? WHAT HAPPENED?

34:31.310 --> 34:33.642
- WELL, IT--
LOOK, MOST OF IT WAS EASY,

34:33.790 --> 34:35.929
BECAUSE NOTHING EVER BOTHERS
HIM, HE DOESN'T GET EMBARRASSED,

34:36.070 --> 34:38.413
AND THEN...

34:38.550 --> 34:41.485
WHEN I STARTED TO TALK
ABOUT GIRLS AND SEXUAL FEELINGS,

34:41.630 --> 34:44.485
HE STOPPED ME.
SAID HE WASN'T READY.

34:44.630 --> 34:47.315
IT WAS LIKE HE KNEW
HIS LIMITATIONS,

34:47.460 --> 34:48.620
AND I JUST DIDN'T--

34:48.770 --> 34:50.453
IT MADE ME FEEL SAD.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.012
YOU KNOW, I HATED IT,
WHEN HADDIE STARTED LIKING BOYS.

34:53.160 --> 34:55.469
- [laughs]
- IT MADE MY SKIN CRAWL.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.670
STILL MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL, BUT--
- THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

34:58.820 --> 35:00.128
- BUT SHE WAS SO EXCITED,
AND I JUST--

35:00.270 --> 35:01.988
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE THAT, TOO.

35:02.130 --> 35:03.199
- HE'S GONNA HAVE THAT, HONEY.
I PROMISE YOU, OKAY.

35:03.340 --> 35:04.329
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.129
- A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH ASPERGER'S,

35:06.270 --> 35:07.999
THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS,
THEY GET MARRIED,

35:08.140 --> 35:09.334
THEY LIVE NORMAL LIV--
- I KNOW BUT SOME OF THEM DON'T.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.515
HEY, BUD, YEP?
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

35:10.660 --> 35:14.107
- DAD, I'M USING YOUR DEODORANT.
- [chuckles]

35:14.250 --> 35:16.275
- WHAT, MY DEODORANT?
REALLY?

35:16.420 --> 35:19.105
[both chuckling]
- YES.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.979
- WELL, HE IS
FULL OF SURPRISES.

35:21.110 --> 35:23.670
- SMALL VICTORIES, BRAVERMAN.

35:23.810 --> 35:25.289
- SMALL VICTORIES.
- IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

35:25.430 --> 35:26.215
GOD, HE TOOK A SHOWER.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.701
- [breathes deep]

35:35.990 --> 35:36.911
- HEY, SARAH.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.642
- HI.
- HI.

35:39.790 --> 35:41.405
- HI, WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

35:41.550 --> 35:45.475
AND H WAS UNPACKING
AND FOUND SOME STUFF OF YOURS,

35:45.620 --> 35:46.655
SO I THOUGHT...
- OH.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.303
- I WOULD DROP IT BY.
- OH, GREAT.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.246
WHAT'S THIS?
- A MUFFIN TIN, AND--SO...

35:49.380 --> 35:50.483
- I REALLY MISSED
THAT MUFFIN TIN.

35:50.630 --> 35:53.076
- I KNOW.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.029
SO, THAT'S ALL.
- THANKS.

35:55.180 --> 35:58.240
- OH, AND DREW IS FINE,
ACTUALLY.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.109
- OH, GOOD.
- I TALKED TO HIM AND, UM--

36:01.260 --> 36:03.945
I MEAN, HE'S DEFINITELY REALLY
STRESSED OUT, BUT I THINK

36:04.090 --> 36:06.467
IT'S REGULAR SENIOR YEAR...
both: STUFF.

36:06.610 --> 36:07.918
YOU KNOW?
- OKAY.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.608
- BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR...
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GLAD.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.502
- YOU KNOW.
- SURE.

36:12.650 --> 36:14.880
YEAH.
- SO...

36:15.030 --> 36:17.089
I HATE THAT WE HAVE TO FIND
THESE FAKE EXCUSES

36:17.240 --> 36:19.549
TO COME AND, UH,
TO SEE EACH OTHER.

36:19.690 --> 36:21.134
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THAT'S YOUR MUFFIN TIN.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.304
- OH, THAT?
NO, THAT'S NOT.

36:22.450 --> 36:24.554
I'VE NEVER HAD A MUFFIN TIN.
- I JUST--

36:24.690 --> 36:27.659
- UM...

36:27.800 --> 36:30.075
HOW ARE YOU?
IS EVERYTHING--

36:30.220 --> 36:31.733
- OH, ME?
- YEAH.

36:31.870 --> 36:34.498
- JUST--[clicks tongue]
- YEAH.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.664
- MM-HMM.

36:35.810 --> 36:36.799
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
- MM-HMM.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.156
- HOW ARE YOU?

36:38.290 --> 36:41.293
- UM...I'M ALL RIGHT.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.649
IT WAS HARD FOR ME
TO SEE YOU,

36:45.780 --> 36:47.714
UH, WITH HANK.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.129
I FEEL LIKE I GAVE UP
TOO EASILY,

36:52.270 --> 36:53.305
AND I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT
FOR YOU.

37:00.110 --> 37:02.419
I DON'T KNOW.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.313
WELL, THANKS FOR THE...

37:05.460 --> 37:07.382
I'LL GET STARTED
ON SOME MUFFINS, I GUESS.

37:10.780 --> 37:13.840
- OKAY.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.016
- BYE.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.027
- I'VE LOST IT ALL,
MY FRIEND...

37:23.170 --> 37:25.195
- WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE HERE?

37:25.340 --> 37:26.329
"OFFICE MANAGER
AT ACCOUNTING FIRM"?

37:26.480 --> 37:30.928
- YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE COMMUTE.
- [scoffs]

37:31.070 --> 37:34.961
- WHAT'S THAT, CROSBY?

37:35.110 --> 37:37.522
- WELL, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU GOT THE JOB

37:37.660 --> 37:39.594
YOU COULD MOVE ANYWHERE
YOU WANTED, REALLY.

37:39.740 --> 37:42.766
IT--WHO CARES WHERE
THE APARTMENT'S AT, AND THEN

37:42.910 --> 37:44.457
THE COMMUTE WOULDN'T BE
AN ISSUE, BUT...

37:44.600 --> 37:48.673
- AND BE THAT FAR AWAY FROM
MY KIDS AND MY GRANDBABY?

37:48.810 --> 37:51.290
I COULDN'T DO THAT.
- MM-HMM.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.987
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT THE PERFECT JOB,

37:53.130 --> 37:54.461
ENGINEERED SPECIFICALLY
TO YOUR NEEDS,

37:54.610 --> 37:55.952
WILL BE...
both: CROSBY.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.785
- MADE EVIDENT SOMEDAY,
AND YOU'LL TAKE IT.

37:58.930 --> 38:01.091
ASSUMING THEY ASK POLITELY.
- CROSBY.

38:01.240 --> 38:05.165
LOOK...I KNOW THAT THIS
SITUATION IS NOT IDEAL.

38:05.310 --> 38:09.246
- MOM.
- NO, LET ME SAY MY PIECE.

38:09.390 --> 38:12.382
CROSBY, ARE YOU AWARE
THAT FOR 30 YEARS

38:12.530 --> 38:15.499
I WORKED AT THE NON-PROFIT
HELPING KIDS

38:15.630 --> 38:16.938
GET HEALTH CARE.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.116
AND NO, I DIDN'T MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY,

38:19.260 --> 38:22.878
BUT EVERY DAY WAS MEANINGFUL.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.250
AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE CARE
OF MY KIDS,

38:25.400 --> 38:27.220
PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.

38:27.370 --> 38:28.644
AND WHAT I DIDN'T GIVE
TO MY KIDS

38:28.780 --> 38:33.740
I GAVE TO THAT NON-PROFIT,
AND NOW I'M A BUDGET CUT.

38:37.790 --> 38:39.200
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST--YOU KNOW,

38:39.350 --> 38:40.965
I JUST--I WANT YOU TO--

38:41.110 --> 38:43.101
- NO.
I'M SORRY.

38:45.840 --> 38:46.829
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:46.970 --> 38:50.736
I MEAN, MAYBE
I AM BEING TOO PICKY.

38:50.880 --> 38:55.158
MAYBE--MAYBE I'VE BEEN
ACTING ENTITLED

38:55.290 --> 38:58.805
TO HAVING THE KIND
OF JOB I'VE HAD FOR 30 YEARS.

39:02.780 --> 39:06.364
AND IF MY PRIDE HAS
INCONVENIENCED YOU ALL,

39:06.510 --> 39:09.479
I AM REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.864
I'M GONNA GO LIE DOWN, OKAY?

39:36.230 --> 39:37.390
- [sighs]
[knock at door]

39:40.680 --> 39:42.887
- LORETTA.
I-I WAS NOT EXPECTING YOU.

39:43.030 --> 39:44.133
I'M SORRY,
DO WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

39:44.270 --> 39:45.339
- NO.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.402
BUT ANYTIME THE POLICE
ARE CALLED,

39:47.550 --> 39:51.486
THE STATE REQUIRES A VISIT FROM
THE CASE SOCIAL WORKER, SO...

39:53.280 --> 39:55.453
IT'S STANDARD FOLLOW UP.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.496
- COME IN.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.394
[sighs]
- WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

40:02.530 --> 40:04.839
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT.
- OH, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.220
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WRONG.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.362
- YOU'RE TRYING,
AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.060
I CAN GIVE YOU TOOLS
AND SUGGESTIONS,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.156
BUT ULTIMATELY,
IT JUST TAKES TIME.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.574
- YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT EVERYONE SAYS, AND I--

40:14.720 --> 40:18.508
WE'VE BEEN GIVING IT TIME,
BUT IT--HONESTLY,

40:18.650 --> 40:19.639
IT'S JUST GETTING
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

40:19.790 --> 40:21.371
IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.545
- IT IS TRUE.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, HONEY.

40:23.690 --> 40:27.694
I MEAN, HE'S MADE INCREDIBLE
STRIDES AT SCHOOL.

40:27.830 --> 40:29.866
HE'S MADE PLENTY OF NEW FRIENDS
AT BASEBALL.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.216
- OKAY, CAN YOU NOT JUST LOOK
AT ONE SIDE OF THIS?

40:31.350 --> 40:32.692
- I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.728
YOU'RE LEAVING ALL OF
THE REST OF IT TO ME.

40:34.880 --> 40:40.568
AT HOME, IT'S NOT WORKING.
HE'S ACTING OUT, AND...

40:42.190 --> 40:43.396
AND...
_ UH--

40:43.540 --> 40:46.816
- HE DESPISES ME.
- JULIA, I NEED TO KNOW.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.985
IS NOT GOING THROUGH
WITH THE ADOPTION

40:49.130 --> 40:50.165
SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE CONSIDERING?

40:50.300 --> 40:51.471
- OF COURSE NOT.

40:53.860 --> 40:56.658
- JULIA?

41:03.840 --> 41:05.626
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO IT ANYMORE.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.588
[knock at door]

41:45.950 --> 41:49.659
- HONEY!

41:49.810 --> 41:50.879
WHAT IS IT?

41:51.020 --> 41:53.432
- UH...

41:53.580 --> 41:57.129
- WHAT IS IT?
- [sobbing]

41:57.270 --> 41:58.601
- HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

42:04.520 --> 42:06.033
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
IT'S OKAY.

42:06.170 --> 42:08.968
IT'S OKAY.
