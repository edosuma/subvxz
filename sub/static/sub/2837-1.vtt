01:02.646 --> 01:04.980
My ears hear what others cannot hear.

01:06.316 --> 01:11.446
Small, faraway things people
cannot normally see are visible to me.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.825
These senses are the fruits
of a lifetime of longing.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.369
Longing to be rescued.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.954
To be completed.

01:21.457 --> 01:24.459
Just as the skirt needs
the wind to billow...

01:24.626 --> 01:28.379
...l'm not formed by things
that are of myself alone.

01:28.547 --> 01:32.300
I wear my father's belt
tied around my mother's blouse.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.471
And shoes which are from my uncle.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.474
This is me.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.148
Just as a flower does
not choose its color...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.402
...we are not responsible
for what we have come to be.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.783
Only once you realize this
do you become free.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.118
And to become adult...

01:59.787 --> 02:01.704
...is to become free.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.725
Richard! No!

03:52.649 --> 03:54.483
A family man...

03:54.651 --> 03:57.612
...devoted husband to his wife, Evelyn...

03:58.113 --> 04:01.324
...loving father to his daughter, India.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.036
He was a model to our town...

04:05.412 --> 04:08.998
...and of what it means to be a man
who walks through the world...

04:09.166 --> 04:13.502
...with openness, honesty and integrity.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.382
- India?
- Richard Stoker was taken from us...

04:18.550 --> 04:20.176
...by a cruel twist of fate.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.636
India?

04:21.803 --> 04:25.514
The reasons for which
are unknown and unknowable.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.143
By an accident
nobody would have predicted.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.730
It would have been impossible
for even an outstanding architect...

04:32.898 --> 04:34.398
...like Richard...

04:34.566 --> 04:37.151
...to understand God's
great design.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.039
India?

04:52.584 --> 04:54.210
India.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.840
The guests will be here soon.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.760
Can you help
Mrs. McGarrick in the kitchen?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.521
Please?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.318
Don't do this to me, India.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.237
Not today.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.210
When they pried open his car...

05:36.378 --> 05:39.130
...you know, his body was burned...
To a crisp.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.756
Terrible accident.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.050
Poor thing.
India was so close to her father.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.886
- Who's gonna look after her?
- She's still got her mother.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.181
Her mother look after her?
Heh. More like the other way around.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.393
You know what?
This whole accident is so strange.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.937
Have you heard
all the rumors floating around...?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.651
You don't think he meant
to drive off the bridge?

06:00.819 --> 06:03.279
Why did he have to go two states away?
I don't know.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.949
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yes, Mrs. McGarrick.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.594
Now I'm wondering
if I kept them in the fridge too long.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.806
What do you think?
Was I too stingy with the paprika?

06:31.099 --> 06:34.477
Mm? Ha, ha.

06:34.853 --> 06:38.064
Your deviled eggs remind me
of when I was a little girl.

06:38.231 --> 06:43.694
Well, you may be all grown up, but you
still get eggshells all over the floor.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.363
Have you outgrown your shoes?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.497
Did you find your birthday present yet?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.295
I found the box, but it was empty.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.631
Are you sure?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.633
Did you check?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.344
Check again.

07:09.513 --> 07:13.599
Every year I thought it was my father
who left me shoes on my birthday.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.185
But all this time, it's been...

07:19.856 --> 07:21.357
Tell me what it opens.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.526
How would I know?

07:25.695 --> 07:26.737
All right.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.364
That was my brother...

07:33.370 --> 07:37.206
You know, originally
they were part of a set of four...

07:37.374 --> 07:39.416
...but then I broke one as a kid.

07:39.584 --> 07:44.713
Now I'm seeing in this house
someone must have let another break.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.841
Unh. No, it wasn't me.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.845
When we, uh... When we moved in, it broke
as the housekeepers were unpacking it.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.388
Ah.
Mm-hm.

07:52.556 --> 07:56.016
India. Come and say hello
to your Uncle Charlie.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.526
India? Come over.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.195
See you soon.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.698
Hello, India.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.077
Come on.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.790
She hates to be touched. Heh.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.750
I'm her mother.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.752
What a curse, hm?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.381
You know, Charlie, Richard used to say...

08:27.549 --> 08:30.176
...that we had lost you
to the rest of the world forever.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.386
Why, India, you're white as a sheet.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.597
Is something wrong?

08:38.143 --> 08:39.518
Yes.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.020
My father is dead.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.849
How beautiful.

09:19.351 --> 09:24.230
Richard was so proud of India's hunting that
he stuffed every single thing she killed.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.192
What a tragic waste of life.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.611
These live particularly deep in the forest.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.322
They'd be very hard to catch.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.577
I guess Richard and India were a good team.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.046
Oh.

09:49.214 --> 09:53.509
It's kind of disrespectful, him not
wearing black to his own brother's funeral.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.553
He must have come back today
from the Middle East or something.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.181
It's just part of a dig
in some old part of Istanbul?

09:59.349 --> 10:02.851
No, I think he was digging for something
quite different. Gold in Indonesia.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.980
I really want to thank you
for your words this morning.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.358
Well, you and Richard deserve every word.
Oh.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.098
The wine's good.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.711
There you are. Come and join us.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.714
This is Richard's brother.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.923
Hello.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.425
- He's back.
- Nice to meet you.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.552
These are the Blooms,
good friends of ours.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.762
Good evening.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.597
I didn't know Richard had a brother.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.973
Nice to meet you.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.933
We're sorry for your loss.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.019
How did you know Richard?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.986
Got his doctorate from Oxford
when he was 24.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.529
Stoker sure had the brains.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.157
Yeah. Just look at India.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.621
Hello, again.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.802
Do you want to know why
you feel at a disadvantage right now?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.764
Because I didn't know
you existed until today?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.809
Because you're standing below me.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.091
You look like my father.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.554
I am so sorry.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.723
It's your loss too.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.275
Oh, um...

12:57.277 --> 12:59.695
In about 60 seconds,
your mother's gonna tell you...

12:59.863 --> 13:02.614
...that I'm gonna be
staying here for a while...

13:03.658 --> 13:05.993
...but I want it to be your decision too.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.620
Why?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.166
Because...

13:13.376 --> 13:15.210
...it's important to me.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.961
This really is a beautiful garden.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.341
The soil...

14:04.802 --> 14:06.386
...is so soft.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.430
Good for digging.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.499
I'm not exactly sure
what you're driving at.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.336
I don't want any trouble.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.089
I am the only one
who would know anything about it.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.341
I did everything you asked of me.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.802
I kept you informed every year.

14:47.679 --> 14:52.307
I was your eyes, your ears,
your hands all this time.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.476
You're acting like you're in diapers now...

14:54.644 --> 14:58.397
...and you've done this to me ever since
you were a child. I'm tired of it.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.274
I am tired of it.
All right.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.662
Mrs. McGarrick?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.374
Mrs. McGarrick?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.297
Where is she?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.340
I haven't seen her yet.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.926
Good morning.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.307
It's afternoon.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.476
Oh. I guess it is.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.521
Do you think you could...?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.109
That's my girl. Thank you.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.194
Mm.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.865
What are you doing today?

15:51.326 --> 15:53.035
Thought I'd...

15:54.329 --> 15:56.288
...draw the curtains, stop the clocks...

15:56.456 --> 16:00.208
...cover the mirrors
and then retire to my room.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.336
Don't be morbid.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.921
Get rid of that dress. What is that?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.215
It's my mourning attire.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.844
Why don't we get out of here, hm?

16:11.721 --> 16:13.972
Go shopping.
We could get some ice cream.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.226
In Victorian times, a widow was expected
to mourn her husband for two years.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.228
At least.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.314
India.
But in Ancient China...

16:22.482 --> 16:27.319
...they built a straw hut beside the grave and
lived there for three years doing nothing.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.073
You and me, ice cream, fresh air.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.160
Come on, all these years
of hunting trips with him...

16:35.328 --> 16:38.413
...and all I'm asking for
is one afternoon with me.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.458
That's what your father would have wanted.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.590
You know, your father and I
weren't always so distant.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.927
I miss when he was...

16:54.222 --> 16:55.764
...young.

19:11.400 --> 19:17.072
India!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.426
Mature aroma.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.095
You chose a good year.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.097
You can't compare it to a younger wine.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.432
Too tannic.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.643
Not ready to be open.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.105
You should have come with us, India.
Oh, the open top...

19:50.273 --> 19:53.358
...the air. It felt so good.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.278
We stopped and Uncle Charlie
got some ice cream for you.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.406
One chocolate, one vanilla.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.283
Did I get it right?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.119
I like the swirl kind.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.498
Oh. You can make the swirl yourself,
you lazy thing.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.750
Where's Mrs. McGarrick?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.252
She's still not here.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.629
What? What are we supposed to do?

20:15.673 --> 20:18.091
I'm not much in the kitchen.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.343
I can cook a little.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.804
No, you don't have to do that.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.347
I'd love to.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.102
Charlie, who in the world are you?

20:31.522 --> 20:34.524
India, would you take these
down to the freezer, please?

20:38.154 --> 20:39.946
Do as your uncle tells you.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.128
Thank you.
Thank you, India.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.327
Too cold down there?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.082
No.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.271
You know, there was a time...

22:36.480 --> 22:40.483
...Richard used to cook meals like this.
Ahem.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.736
Wasn't there, India?

22:43.112 --> 22:48.116
Oh. Phew. I'm sorry, of course.
That was before you were born.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.329
Where did you learn to cook like this,
Charlie?

22:54.165 --> 22:55.749
Madame Jacquin.

22:56.292 --> 23:00.920
She ran a Michelin-starred restaurant
outside of Toulouse called "L'Institution."

23:01.380 --> 23:04.424
- Hm. A female chef.
- Mm.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.802
In her opinion,
there was nothing a man could master...

23:07.970 --> 23:09.971
...that a woman couldn't make.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.806
What do you mean?

23:11.974 --> 23:14.517
It sounds better in French.

23:15.102 --> 23:19.147
Did I tell you on the way home?
Your French accent is perfect.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.360
One of the perks of a
first-class education. Heh.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.447
I could stay locked up in this house
for the rest of my life...

23:27.615 --> 23:31.451
...yet still speak impeccable French. Heh.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.413
I know you're not gonna spend the rest
of your life locked up in this house.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.958
How do you spend your days?
I want to know my brother's wife.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.381
Oh, I don't know where to start. Ha, ha.

23:46.133 --> 23:50.136
Charlie, you didn't even touch your food.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.972
Did you put poison
in the food just for us girls?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.143
But India ate everything.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.772
Practically licked it clean.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.862
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.532
Now, can I get you anything else?

24:10.699 --> 24:13.493
Maybe some ice cream?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.370
No.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.039
"No, thank you."

24:19.542 --> 24:21.876
I mean, no, thank you.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.967
Would you like to
play something for us after dinner?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.885
I don't think so.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.137
Would you?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.972
India.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.224
I mean, no, thank you.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.359
Why didn't you tell me I had an uncle?

24:46.527 --> 24:50.196
Because I barely knew about Charlie myself.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.950
I mean, he's been traveling the world
for as long as I've known your father.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.952
You know, he used to say to me:

24:56.495 --> 25:00.331
"What kind of family is family
that never comes home?"

25:02.084 --> 25:05.044
Let's stop talking about Richard.
Excuse me.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.923
I'm sorry.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.878
1994.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.884
The year you were born.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.672
What do you want from me?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.548
To be friends.

26:41.684 --> 26:44.018
We don't need to be friends.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.315
We're family.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.653
It takes time to observe attentively.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.198
Wait for the moment that our eyes...

26:57.366 --> 27:00.368
...finally penetrate the
inside of the subject.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.953
Look, Marv...

27:02.121 --> 27:04.330
...see that flower?
The way it just hangs there?

27:04.498 --> 27:06.416
My eyes are penetrating
the inside of you.

27:06.583 --> 27:10.837
Observe carefully
and you'll note that this plant...

27:14.466 --> 27:16.134
Check out Pitts.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.970
I want you to really...

27:19.138 --> 27:20.638
Hey.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.061
- Pitts.
- Yes, Mr. Feldman?

27:28.397 --> 27:31.232
Is there something you'd
like to share with the rest of the class?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.484
Yeah, I've got something I'd like to share.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.570
With India.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.508
He's gorgeous.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.119
Hey.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.291
Come back.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.481
Mom?

29:19.383 --> 29:21.175
It's going to rain.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.789
Mm. Relax.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.709
There.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.214
Curl your fingers.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.051
No.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.095
Watch me. You see?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.184
Oh.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
I'm teaching him piano.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.688
Uncle Charlie is a complete beginner.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.066
Put on some dry clothes
and come play with us.

30:19.234 --> 30:24.155
Why don't you take a hot shower first
or you'll catch a cold. Come on. Here.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.577
Good morning, sweetie.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.039
Charlie cleared off the court yesterday.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.416
So we're just gonna walk on over.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.461
You don't want to come, do you?

30:38.629 --> 30:40.338
Hello, India.

30:41.215 --> 30:43.382
I took one of Richard's belts.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.385
- His whites are a little big.
- Mm.

30:46.929 --> 30:47.929
Ready?

30:48.555 --> 30:49.597
Let's go.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.942
India?

31:01.443 --> 31:02.818
Oh.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.612
It's me.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.657
Come and give your Auntie Gin a hug.

31:17.251 --> 31:20.878
- What time did you get in, Gwendolyn?
- Around 4.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.464
Mm. That's right.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.133
And when do you fly out?

31:28.387 --> 31:30.972
That remains to be seen.

31:31.473 --> 31:34.016
I'd originally planned
to stay for only a day or two...

31:34.184 --> 31:37.979
...but now I'm thinking
I should stay a bit longer.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.356
Spend a little quality time with India.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.110
Hm. How nice for her.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.489
Charles?
Auntie Gin.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.449
How long have you been here?

31:51.285 --> 31:52.785
Not long.

31:52.953 --> 31:57.164
We're so grateful that he's taken time away
from his commitments in Europe.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.167
Europe?
Yes.

32:14.683 --> 32:20.479
Evie, dear, after dinner, I was
thinking perhaps you and I could talk.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.982
- We are talking.
- Alone.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.985
About what?
Like Richard, for instance.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.279
Richard?
Yes, Evie. Richard.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.197
My nephew, your late husband.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.700
I don't think I'll be forgetting his name
any time soon.

32:32.868 --> 32:38.664
Of course not. I just thought
there might be arrangements to be made.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.334
Things to be settled.

32:41.501 --> 32:46.047
Our lawyer has said none of this has anything
to do with you. You're not in the will.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.550
No, dear, I mean something
entirely different.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.386
Like, for example...

32:52.554 --> 32:57.350
...maybe we could talk about
your living here with Charlie like this.

32:59.936 --> 33:04.106
Auntie Gin isn't shy when it comes
to expressing her opinions about me.

33:04.274 --> 33:07.735
Like when Richard asked me to marry him.
What Auntie Gin might be surprised...

33:07.903 --> 33:11.697
...to learn is that those opinions
are neither wanted, needed, or appreciated.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.200
Evie...
You come into my home and attack me...

33:14.368 --> 33:16.369
...at a time like this.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.079
Evie...

33:24.419 --> 33:27.588
I'm sure Auntie Gin didn't mean anything.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.882
You didn't mean anything by it, did you?

33:30.050 --> 33:31.592
No.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.262
No, of course not, Evie dear.

33:35.764 --> 33:40.309
Now, would either of you two
like to play something for us after dinner?

33:41.144 --> 33:42.812
No, thank you.
No, thank you.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.692
Good night, Auntie Gin.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.696
Don't mind Evie. She's just tired.
Oh, um...

33:51.863 --> 33:54.115
What was the name of your hotel again?

33:55.367 --> 33:58.828
The Biltmore.
The Biltmore.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.832
Maybe we could have breakfast together.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.709
Just us girls.
Oh, I'm not sure.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.460
Can you take her to the Biltmore Hotel?

34:06.628 --> 34:09.045
I'll probably have a
headache in the morning.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.967
Drive carefully.
Auntie Gin, stay the night here.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.969
Oh.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.931
You made the evening much nicer.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.434
Oh, thank you, dear.

34:21.601 --> 34:27.313
But an old woman needs time on her own
to recover. Good night, sweet child.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.735
Call me.

34:39.619 --> 34:43.164
Are there any other hotels in town
besides the Biltmore?

34:43.415 --> 34:47.960
Even family ties
have no meaning when food is scarce.

34:48.128 --> 34:52.630
This one knows there is no room
for his brother in the hunt.

34:52.799 --> 34:58.804
While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel,
in the end, it is for the best.

34:59.765 --> 35:03.350
Each day in the hunt
brings the eagle closer to maturity.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.858
And chicks of his own.

35:11.026 --> 35:15.279
The most patient of predators,
the black eagle can circle for hours...

35:15.447 --> 35:18.532
...waiting for the perfect
moment to strike.

35:18.700 --> 35:23.496
The fish will provide much needed
nourishment for her growing chicks.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.974
I was wondering
if anyone had turned in a cell phone.

35:44.142 --> 35:48.479
I think I may have dropped it
when I was checking in.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.774
Are you absolutely certain?

35:52.400 --> 35:59.406
All right. Oh, wait, wait. Um,
what number do I have to press to dial out?

35:59.783 --> 36:02.576
Nine. Yes, I thought so.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.306
Oh. Come on.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.642
The mountains
are no place for the faint of heart.

37:08.810 --> 37:12.271
The steep terrain and harsh climate
make a challenging climate...

37:12.439 --> 37:14.315
...for even the strongest of species.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.491
- Wings are freedom.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.664
- While the eagle prefers to find its own meals,
there is nothing wrong in having a little help.

37:32.626 --> 37:36.670
Any advantage in nature is to be
appreciated, and what the left...

37:39.174 --> 37:43.969
- A hearty meal for the hungry bird
who lived to hunt another day.

38:03.531 --> 38:08.619
- Thirteen pounds
and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.720
You said you were staying
at the Biltmore Hotel...

38:26.888 --> 38:28.931
...and yet, here you are.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.226
I even had to call the cab company.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.072
- Prey does not suspect
the hunter is circling high above...

38:45.949 --> 38:48.534
...and is taken completely by surprise.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.793
Oh.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.795
- Hey, yo, yo. Look who's here.
- No kidding?

39:41.963 --> 39:44.965
- Is it...? Is it true?
- Is it?

39:51.473 --> 39:52.473
Yo, check this out.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.851
- I'm telling you, she can talk, bro.
- Well, let's find out.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.520
- Oh, creepy, man.
- All right, shh, shh.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.481
Hey, Stoker.

40:03.318 --> 40:07.571
Uh-oh. Ooh.
- Mm-mm.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.533
- Hey, Stoker.
- Where you going?

40:11.701 --> 40:13.619
I'm talking to you.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.331
Or do you go by Stroker now?

40:17.499 --> 40:20.125
Because I hear
that's what your mom's been doing...

40:20.293 --> 40:21.627
...to your uncle.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.547
You been getting in on that?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.760
- What did you say?
- Ooh!

40:29.928 --> 40:32.846
She speaks.
"What did you say?"

40:34.182 --> 40:36.266
I think you heard me, Stroker.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.893
Say that again?

40:38.061 --> 40:40.854
Uh-oh.
- Oh!

40:41.314 --> 40:45.275
All right. I think you'd better
watch your step, Stroker.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.028
You know what happens
to little girls who mess with me?

40:49.155 --> 40:51.031
Watch this.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.702
What's up, bitch?

40:57.080 --> 40:59.373
- What's up?
- Ooh.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.511
- Hey, come here, you all right?
- Oh, my God.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.179
You okay?

41:14.472 --> 41:17.391
All right, Pitts. That's enough.

41:17.559 --> 41:18.725
Get out of here, Whip.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.896
Follow the bouncing ball, jackass.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.566
She's not interested.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.111
Dude, let's just go.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.907
Yeah, like I enjoy wasting my time
on this bitch, anyways. Let's go.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.161
Freak.
Sorry about that.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.413
He's an A-hole, okay? Just ignore him.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.167
Hey.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.377
Where you going?

42:14.115 --> 42:15.782
Too cold down there?

42:24.876 --> 42:27.961
India, would you take these down
to the freezer, please?

46:40.381 --> 46:44.301
That I had only sang to just a few

46:45.720 --> 46:51.433
She saw my silver spurs
And said let's pass some time

46:52.477 --> 46:58.356
And I will give to you
Summer wine

46:59.066 --> 47:03.945
Oh, summer wine

47:06.199 --> 47:12.746
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring

47:13.080 --> 47:19.044
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things

47:19.295 --> 47:22.255
You stayed longer than I thought you would.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.968
You probably need to move on.

47:27.136 --> 47:32.432
And I will give to you
Summer wine

47:35.394 --> 47:37.437
You want me to leave?

47:40.358 --> 47:42.567
My eyes grew heavy

47:42.735 --> 47:43.777
Come on.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.280
You could return to Madame Jacquin.

47:49.575 --> 47:52.702
But I couldn't find my feet

47:53.871 --> 47:58.375
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar line

47:58.543 --> 47:59.626
Dance with me.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.796
And then she gave to me

48:02.964 --> 48:04.798
I always end up leading.

48:06.759 --> 48:07.968
Well then, lead me, Evie.

48:14.225 --> 48:20.564
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring

48:21.107 --> 48:26.194
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things

48:26.362 --> 48:27.862
You know...

48:28.823 --> 48:29.948
...for me...

48:30.825 --> 48:33.493
...it doesn't matter who you are.

48:34.203 --> 48:36.496
I feel the same.

48:38.708 --> 48:41.418
Really?
Mm-hm.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.838
It doesn't matter who I am for me, either.

48:48.634 --> 48:54.180
When I woke up
The sun was shining in my eyes

48:55.391 --> 49:01.396
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice its size

49:02.189 --> 49:08.028
She took my silver spurs
A dollar and a dime

49:08.988 --> 49:14.909
And left me cravin' for
More summer wine

49:15.620 --> 49:23.620
Oh, summer wine

49:54.367 --> 49:55.408
Whip.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.665
Hey.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.459
I just thought I...

50:05.878 --> 50:07.921
I've never been here before.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.507
Yeah, no kidding.

50:12.635 --> 50:15.220
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.222
Have fun, bro.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.235
So...

50:31.654 --> 50:33.446
You wanna go inside?

50:37.076 --> 50:39.619
Then where would you like to go?

50:47.962 --> 50:52.132
India Stoker,
Middlebend straight-A student...

50:52.299 --> 50:55.593
...hanging out in the
parking lot at Rockets?

50:55.761 --> 50:57.887
Doesn't really seem like you.

50:58.639 --> 51:00.765
Not that you would know.

51:02.309 --> 51:06.771
Well, I... I guess you're right.
I wouldn't.

51:07.606 --> 51:09.649
It's just that, um...

51:10.025 --> 51:11.484
Yes.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.237
I know what you mean.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.656
Oh, yeah?

51:17.658 --> 51:19.200
How's that?

51:24.206 --> 51:26.332
Have you ever seen
a photograph of yourself...

51:27.334 --> 51:30.754
...taken when you didn't know
you're being photographed?

51:32.047 --> 51:35.467
From an angle you don't get to see
when you look in the mirror.

51:36.552 --> 51:39.262
And you think, "That's me."

51:40.097 --> 51:42.766
That's also me."

51:43.017 --> 51:44.392
Do you...?

51:45.186 --> 51:47.520
Do you know what I'm talking about?

51:49.064 --> 51:52.025
Yeah. I think I do.

51:58.741 --> 52:00.408
Well...

52:00.576 --> 52:02.869
...that's how I feel tonight.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.290
So you're surprised at yourself?

52:16.592 --> 52:19.803
You're not afraid of being touched anymore?

52:22.181 --> 52:24.265
Please don't spoil it.

53:11.230 --> 53:13.273
Holy shit.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.441
Everyone said you were crazy.

53:16.235 --> 53:18.945
But they have no idea, do they?

53:19.113 --> 53:21.281
I wanna go home now.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.449
Let me go.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.076
No, you don't.

53:25.244 --> 53:29.038
You opened this door,
and now you're gonna walk through it.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.212
- Shh!
- Oh...

53:36.380 --> 53:38.089
Quiet.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.633
Hold still.

53:40.801 --> 53:43.303
This is not gonna hurt.

53:43.929 --> 53:45.346
Shit, what...?

53:45.514 --> 53:47.307
Unh! Ow! Oh, ow!

53:47.474 --> 53:48.850
Stop, stop, stop.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.269
I broke my... Ow.

53:51.437 --> 53:54.606
Glad I borrowed your dad's belt.
Mine would've been way too short.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.817
- Ow. Shit...
- All yours.

53:57.985 --> 54:01.446
- I'm seriously hurt. Shit.
- Shut up.

54:20.883 --> 54:23.968
Ow. Ow!

54:24.136 --> 54:27.138
India, stop. Ow. Ow.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.474
India. Ow. Unh!

54:29.642 --> 54:31.768
Stop. Stop.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.449
Aah. Unh!
I'll kill you.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.245
I don't give a fuck...

59:22.893 --> 59:24.518
Strawberries, cherries

59:26.855 --> 59:28.564
Yes?

59:33.612 --> 59:35.154
Can I come in?

59:38.450 --> 59:40.409
Well, what time is it?

59:55.175 --> 59:57.343
Would you brush my hair?

59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.514
I was just going to bed.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.186
Then I'll brush yours.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:14.151
You're wearing the nightgown I bought you.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:22.076
Tonight I felt like wearing something silk.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:26.414
Now that I think about it,
I never brushed your hair...

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.666
...did I?

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.501
You were busy.

01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:34.839
With what?

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.049
I don't know.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.553
You and your father
were always on your hunting trips.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:45.558
How could I compete with all of those
dead birds you constantly brought home?

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:49.937
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar...

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.199
I saw you in the dining room today.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.078
I don't know what you think you saw...

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.249
...but nothing happened.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.546
You were so still,
I never even heard you there.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.923
Dad taught me that.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.594
Hunting.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.932
To wait.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.521
In silence.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.779
We wouldn't need food or drink.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.990
We would watch everything.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.286
The patterns of tree branches
spreading out...

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.749
...the thousands of shapes clouds make.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.920
I could count the number of
leaves on a tree in five hours.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:05.304
I always thought Dad liked hunting.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.348
But tonight I realized he did it for me.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.937
He used to say, "Sometimes
you need to do something bad..."

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:16.232
...to stop you from doing something worse."

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.045
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go
to the hairdresser...

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:41.340
...after I clean out your father's study.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.543
Dear India, happy birthday.

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:26.005
You are 5 years old today.
I wish I could be there for your party...

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.508
...but your uncle is far away in Africa
taking pictures for the magazine.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:32.469
Dearest India, I'm writing this
letter to you from Florence.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.973
Yesterday, I circled Michelangelo's David
for hours. He carries a sling.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:38.350
His belted weapon over his left shoulder.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:41.895
- You are my dearest and only niece.
- My silent and invisible partner.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:45.024
And these are the lessons for you
in our many chapters together.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.775
- Dear India.
- Happy birthday again.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.819
I've missed your first teeth coming out.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.030
I'll never see the holes in your smile...

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.557
...or how they will fill in
as you mature into a young lady.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:59.371
This custom of hugging and kissing.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.874
I think you, too, would
find this uncomfortable.

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.918
If I found it was you in an embrace,
I could make an exception.

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:07.296
- I wonder if you would, too.
- Happy Valentine's.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.048
- Happy Halloween.
- Merry Christmas.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:12.509
- Though I never receive a letter...
- I see your messages in the stars.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:13.927
Or in the music I hear.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:18.057
It is a whistling tune from a lonely man
wandering in a foreign land.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.185
I sense things so acutely
until it becomes almost too much.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:23.896
I wonder if for you, too,
life is made difficult by...

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:27.775
The fact that you can hear what others
cannot hear, see what they cannot see.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.403
I know that someday you'll be
very special, India, and you already are.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:35.032
- I know inside you feel some loneliness.
- Because you are the only one.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.036
Please know that I am
with you as we share the same blood.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.747
Tonight, I'll fall asleep
as I try to imagine...

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.917
...that you'll grow up
and take over our name.

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.586
How I want to meet you.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:51.590
All my love, Charlie.
All my love, Charlie.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:16.175
You've reached the Middlebend
Sheriff's Department non-emergency number.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:20.470
If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 911.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:24.808
Otherwise, please hold
for the next available operator.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:30.564
Middlebend Sheriff's Department,
how may I help you?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:36.069
Hello?

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:48.874
My father had the exact same sunglasses.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:58.801
He wore them only when he was driving so
they were always in the glove compartment.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:04.223
Now I suppose they're all melted up,
along with the rest of the car.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:07.267
Please leave before my mother wakes up.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.231
Aren't you curious
about what happened to Richard?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.944
I'm curious
about what happened to Jonathan.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:25.577
That's an inseparable part
of what happened to Richard.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:30.082
Richard was completely taken with Jonathan.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.920
That summer, Jonathan had just learned
how to climb the stairs.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.421
Let's go again. Let's go.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:40.425
He couldn't resist climbing
any staircase he came across.

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:58.170
It's been 20 years since your family
donated this building to Crawford.

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:01.882
It may look old now, but Charlie's
room is still very comfortable.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.928
As you know,
he was the one who wanted to stay here.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.306
And he insisted on being discharged
on this day.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.141
Today.

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:13.685
Welcome to my home.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:18.899
Away from home.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.709
Until we meet again.

01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:49.388
I'm so proud of you.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.926
It always was your favorite car.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:35.058
I think you're gonna love New York.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.269
I got you your own apartment.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.981
You see?

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:44.651
Aren't we going to your house?

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.904
Everything you need is in here.

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.950
Why aren't we going to your place?

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:57.956
I'm not gonna see India?

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.124
Here are the keys.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:02.002
I think you'll see that I've taken care of
all the details.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.296
Why are you doing this to me?

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:08.508
Do I really have to tell you something
you already know?

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.552
Why can't I go?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.596
Charlie.

01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:14.389
Why not?

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.354
Tell me.

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.067
You listen very carefully.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.444
This is the most important thing.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:32.491
If anything happens, you must call...
You still love me, don't you, Richie?

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:37.829
Yes, of course, I love you, Charlie.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:45.212
I just have to love you a little less now.
I can't have you...

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:49.007
Near my India, my family.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.300
And I said:

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.178
But I'm your family.

01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:58.308
What kind of family
is family you can't take home?

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.018
Jesus.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:01.186
Excuse me.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.024
Jesus, Charlie.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.551
Are you okay?

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.138
I'm fine, Richie.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:38.723
I'm fine now.

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:42.352
Thank you for asking.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.452
Charlie?

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.957
Unh. Oh, Charlie.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.723
Of course, I still love you, Richard.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.311
I just have to love you
a little bit less now.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.786
Why now?

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.290
Why come back now?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.468
The day I left Crawford...

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.012
...the day your father had his accident...

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.890
...what day was it, do you remember?

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.642
Yes.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.853
I remember.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.813
What day was it?

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:14.152
It was my 18th birthday.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.121
I was waiting.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:27.832
For you.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.668
Everything I've ever done.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:33.338
For you, India.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.766
Happy birthday, India.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.525
Yes, sheriff.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:21.404
I was hungry,
so I stopped by Rockets for some fries.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:26.409
I bumped into Whip at the parking lot
and we decided to go for a walk.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.496
At night? Those woods are dangerous.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.790
Oh, I wasn't scared.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.084
Not with Whip there.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.836
He's so strong.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.464
I see.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:46.221
So we had a very nice time.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:51.101
And then?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.978
And then I went home.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.315
I thought Whip said
he was heading home too.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:59.901
Any idea what time that was?

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.487
Well, that was, uh...

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:05.865
When did you eat the fries?

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:08.993
Excuse me?

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.247
Well, you said you went there
because you were hungry? Uh...

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:19.170
And then, that is, after having a nice time,
you would have become even more hungry...

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:22.841
...and if you went to eat some fries...

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:27.011
...I could find some people that can
remember what time they saw you.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.973
I think I, um...

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.766
I think I must have been...

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.852
I must have been blushing.

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:36.938
It was my first time outside with a boy.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.357
I didn't want to be seen.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.860
It was 8:30 when you came home.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.029
Il Trovatore was playing on PBS.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.908
Yeah, when I came home,
my uncle was watching T. V...

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:51.202
...so I watched it with him.

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.538
Um, just one moment.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:58.209
Il Trovatore.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.920
What is it? It's a foreign movie?

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:04.340
No. No, it's an opera by Verdi.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:07.469
Would you like me to write it down?
I'm fine.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:10.096
I do hope Whip's okay.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:12.223
Well, his folks are a mess.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:16.728
Then again, I have a feeling
that he'll turn up.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.063
Boys that age...

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:20.982
Well, you know how they are.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.109
- I'm sure I do.
- Heh.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:25.737
You will let me know if you hear anything,
won't you?

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:27.322
Will do.

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:29.908
Okay.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.494
Well, I'll be in touch.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.703
Goodbye, sheriff.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:35.747
Goodbye, sheriff.

01:20:40.628 --> 01:20:42.045
Oh.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:49.427
Oh, by the way, did your housekeeper ever
get in touch after leaving town so quick?

01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:54.641
No.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.310
She didn't.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:02.690
Strange how people
can just disappear on you.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:17.372
He'll be back.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.252
What are we going to do?

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:29.217
I think we'll really love New York.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:39.561
When do we leave?

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.000
I'm sorry.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.592
Tomorrow night.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:33.966
- Should we do it again?
- I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:48.564
You know, I've often wondered why it is
we have children in the first place.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:53.486
And the conclusion I've come to is...

01:23:56.031 --> 01:24:00.618
...at some point in our lives,
we realize things are...

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.621
They're screwed up beyond repair.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:08.334
So we decide to start again.

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:11.838
Wipe the slate clean.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.799
Start afresh.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.221
And we have children.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:27.145
Little carbon copies we can turn to and
say, "You will do what I could not."

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:31.691
You will succeed where I have failed."

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:37.822
Because we want someone
to get it right this time.

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:47.248
But not me.

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:57.675
Personally speaking,
I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:09.437
India...

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:15.193
...who are you?

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:21.616
You were supposed to love me, weren't you?

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.018
Come up to my room, please.

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.564
I enjoyed your performance.

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:03.074
India, go and pack a small bag.

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:05.868
We'll be leaving shortly.

01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:42.572
I, uh...

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:46.617
I came to say goodbye.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.245
I can't allow you to do this.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:50.913
Why not?

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:02.466
There are little things one notices along
the way, but one suppresses because...

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.594
Because?

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.763
Why do you think?

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.018
Love?

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.981
Richard loved India.

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:21.360
He would never have driven
so far away on her birthday.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:27.199
Not unless, for some reason he was called
away by someone he couldn't say no to.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.830
Auntie Gin
wanted to speak to me about you...

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:36.334
...but she never did come back
after that night, did she?

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:43.382
People disappear...

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:46.260
...all the time.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:12.536
Have me instead,
but stay away from my daughter.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.372
She's of age.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:16.165
Of age for what?

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:22.546
To live in this house on her own
while her mother finally travels the world.

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:25.091
Don't you want to speak French in France?

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:29.178
What are you suggesting?

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.023
Come with me.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.416
India.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:42.126
India, come here and look.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:54.305
India, come here.

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.855
India! Come here! Now!

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:48.646
In a hurry?

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:52.149
Know how fast you were going?

01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:57.863
Pardon?

01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:05.496
Effectively fast, Mister Sheriff.

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:11.669
Effective for what?

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:15.339
To get your attention.

01:34:00.719 --> 01:34:05.723
I became the color
I became the daughter and the son

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:11.270
When the feast is over
Welcome to another one

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:14.690
I lay my body down, down
Down upon the water

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:17.359
Wrapped up in the clothes
Of my mother and my father

01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:19.820
Oh, this is longing
I wanna be complete

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:25.242
I was waiting around in a little jump seat
I had hunger, a mouthful of M&Ms

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:30.331
You'd do anything just to get rescued
I had longing, isn't it the key?

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.666
Take take
Taste taste taste sweet

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.502
They said I'd gone south
Said I'd gone asunder

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.296
I was just free

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:43.719
We were ready to behave

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:48.849
But there's no freedom without no key

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:54.063
Whatever you think you'll become

01:34:54.356 --> 01:34:58.734
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:04.448
Oh, no, no, take me from my misery
There's no such thing as living comfortably

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:09.620
There's no such thing as going home
I'm not formed of myself alone

01:35:09.788 --> 01:35:12.289
All the other others,
they just fade to black

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:15.125
When you think you have me's
When I don't look back

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:20.255
Keep on laughing, calling after me
Keep on laughing, I'm just free

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:25.886
We were ready to behave

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:31.100
But there's no freedom without no key

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:36.355
Whatever you think you'll become

01:35:36.523 --> 01:35:40.984
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from

01:36:45.592 --> 01:36:50.345
We were ready to behave

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:55.726
But there's no freedom without no key

01:36:55.894 --> 01:37:00.898
Whatever you think you'll become

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:05.569
All that matters, dear
Is where you're coming from
