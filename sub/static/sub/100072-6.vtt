Good evening, Quahog.
Our top story:

00:37.021 --> 00:39.689
a local Yankee fan's dream
comes true

00:39.690 --> 00:42.191
when he's diagnosed
with Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:42.192 --> 00:43.735
But first...

00:43.736 --> 00:45.620
Hey, the TV went out.

00:45.621 --> 00:47.455
OTHERS:
Huh.

00:47.456 --> 00:50.792
Oh, my God, the Wi-Fi is out.

00:50.793 --> 00:53.469
(screaming, shouting)

00:56.799 --> 00:57.891
(grunting)

00:57.892 --> 00:59.393
Okay, everyone calm down.

00:59.394 --> 01:01.252
I know
how we'll get through this.

01:01.253 --> 01:05.065
This is the story of
the greatest trilogy ever told,

01:05.066 --> 01:06.808
<i>The Mighty Ducks.</i>

01:06.809 --> 01:09.069
It was a time
of great nonsense.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.812
Dad, why don't you tell us
how you and Mom

01:10.813 --> 01:12.480
fell in love and got married?

01:12.481 --> 01:14.649
And in go the earbuds.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.392
Terrific episode idea, Meg.

01:16.393 --> 01:18.227
Well, it was the 1990s,

01:18.228 --> 01:20.938
the decade of Viagra
but also Lorena Bobbitt,

01:20.939 --> 01:23.941
so it was kind of
a yay-boo period for penises.

01:23.942 --> 01:26.611
After graduating, your mom
and me moved to the city

01:26.612 --> 01:28.163
with all our friends.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.576

01:33.577 --> 01:36.245
<i>I lived with my best friends,</i>
<i>Quagmire and Cleveland.</i>

01:36.246 --> 01:38.432
<i>We were the kind of friends</i>
<i>who were all good-looking,</i>

01:38.433 --> 01:40.792
<i>except for David Schwimmer.</i>

01:40.793 --> 01:42.251
<i>And your mom lived</i>
<i>across the hall</i>

01:42.252 --> 01:44.128
<i>with her friends Bonnie and...</i>

01:44.129 --> 01:45.463
<i>uh, Bonnie.</i>

01:45.464 --> 01:47.090
<i>God, we desperately need to get</i>

01:47.091 --> 01:49.092
<i>more female characters</i>
<i>in this show.</i>

01:49.093 --> 01:50.277
<i>I was the Chandler.</i>

01:50.278 --> 01:52.112
<i>Not because</i>
<i>of my sarcastic zingers</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:55.115
<i>but because I liked</i>
<i>to take 40 Vicodin a day.</i>

01:55.116 --> 01:56.524
Guys, I've got big news.

01:56.525 --> 01:58.285
Tell 'em, Quagmire.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.786
I got a promotion
at Blockbuster!

01:59.787 --> 02:01.529
- (gasping)
- (clapping four times)

02:01.530 --> 02:04.941
Gleonard Quagmire,
that is fantastic news!

02:04.942 --> 02:06.651
I know, right?
You know how I always felt

02:06.652 --> 02:08.110
like I was stuck in second gear?

02:08.112 --> 02:09.704
Well, this is a new gear!

02:09.705 --> 02:11.373
Well, congratulations, Glenn!

02:11.374 --> 02:13.825
This calls for a fountain dance.

02:13.826 --> 02:16.803
(90s-style sitcom theme playing)

02:16.804 --> 02:19.306
<i>PETER: I was the least graceful</i>
<i>at fountain dancing.</i>

02:19.307 --> 02:21.791
<i>I just swung my arms</i>
<i>and tried to fit in.</i>

02:21.792 --> 02:23.000
<i>It was senseless.</i>
<i>We were in our clothes,</i>

02:23.001 --> 02:24.719
<i>for God's sake.</i>
<i>Everyone got wet.</i>

02:24.720 --> 02:26.221
<i>It was cold. You know,</i>

02:26.222 --> 02:27.588
<i>there were</i>
<i>originally nine friends,</i>

02:27.589 --> 02:28.840
<i>but three of 'em died</i>
<i>of pneumonia.</i>

02:28.841 --> 02:30.133

02:35.231 --> 02:36.447
¶ ¶

02:38.734 --> 02:42.145
<i>We also hung out at</i>
<i>our favorite café, Perk Place,</i>

02:42.146 --> 02:43.980
<i>where we would all sweat</i>
<i>like crazy</i>

02:43.981 --> 02:45.690
<i>'cause everyone in the '90s</i>
<i>wore turtlenecks,</i>

02:45.691 --> 02:48.001
<i>vests, and Jamiroquai hats.</i>

02:48.002 --> 02:49.744
Lois, you look down.
What's wrong?

02:49.745 --> 02:52.530
Brad Pitt broke up with me
in a pretty public way.

02:52.531 --> 02:55.324
I just don't know
if I'll ever date again.

02:55.325 --> 02:57.660
Wait, I thought you and Dad
dated in high school.

02:57.661 --> 02:58.904
Did you break up?

02:58.905 --> 03:01.038
Uh-uh, story's not over, Meg.
Settle down.

03:01.039 --> 03:03.425
Your father and I had dated
for a few years,

03:03.426 --> 03:05.260
but I didn't know
if it was going anywhere.

03:05.261 --> 03:08.713
So we decided to take a break
but remained close friends.

03:08.714 --> 03:11.674
I actually briefly dated one
of our roommates, Barry.

03:11.675 --> 03:13.885
He was one of them
what the fountain took.

03:13.886 --> 03:16.888
My father had planned out
my whole life for me.

03:16.889 --> 03:19.700
<i>He wanted me to marry one</i>
<i>of Quahog's up-and-comers,</i>

03:19.701 --> 03:21.276

03:50.923 --> 03:54.592
Lois, let's go take a midnight
swim at Sharkbite Cove.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.403
Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus,

03:56.404 --> 03:58.238
but I have other plans.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.742
Okay, well,
I'm definitely going.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.247
Peter, why don't you admit it?

04:07.248 --> 04:08.990
You still got the hots for Lois.

04:08.991 --> 04:09.991
It's obvious.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.275
Nah, we're broken up.

04:11.276 --> 04:12.085
We're just friends now.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.402
<i>(four claps)</i>

04:13.403 --> 04:15.279
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>I realize he was right.</i>

04:15.280 --> 04:17.615
<i>But the '90s was</i>
<i>an exciting time,</i>

04:17.616 --> 04:20.743
<i>and we wanted to experience</i>
<i>all it had to offer.</i>

04:20.744 --> 04:22.286
Hey, guys,
there's a great concert

04:22.287 --> 04:24.413
in World Trade Center Plaza
this weekend!

04:24.414 --> 04:25.748
Really? Who's playing?

04:25.749 --> 04:27.792
They got Korn,
Cranberries and Cake.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.752
Oh, that sounds delicious.
But who are the bands?

04:29.753 --> 04:31.087
They're opening with Cake.

04:31.088 --> 04:33.181
Wait, shouldn't cake be last?
It's a dessert.

04:33.182 --> 04:35.517
Korn is last.
Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.

04:35.518 --> 04:37.444
Corn is not a bigger draw
than cake.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.136
- Cake is delicious.
- "No Doubt"?

04:39.137 --> 04:40.947
Well, I'm glad
you agree with me, Quagmire,

04:40.948 --> 04:43.307
but that still doesn't address
this issue of the order.

04:43.308 --> 04:45.527
My last show
was a Weezer concert.

04:45.528 --> 04:47.788
Well, that's 'cause
everyone smokes nowadays.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.939
What band did we see last time
at the Palladium?

04:49.940 --> 04:50.982
It was, uh, Blur.

04:50.983 --> 04:52.534
Yeah, I can't remember, either.

04:52.535 --> 04:55.152
<i>It was a very confusing time</i>
<i>in music.</i>

04:55.153 --> 04:57.113

05:28.645 --> 05:30.497
<i>But despite having broken up,</i>

05:30.498 --> 05:32.499
<i>I would sometimes sneak away</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:34.075

05:34.076 --> 05:36.411
Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs

05:36.412 --> 05:37.628

05:45.754 --> 05:48.664
Peter, quit trying to flirt with
that clearly girlfriend of yours

05:48.665 --> 05:51.042
and come watch giant box TV
with us!

05:51.043 --> 05:52.927
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>We all watched</i> The X-Files,

05:52.928 --> 05:55.355
<i>which would be</i>
<i>Fox's last hit show.</i>

05:55.356 --> 05:58.266

05:58.267 --> 06:00.343
<i>and Paul Reiser, its king,</i>

06:01.511 --> 06:04.221
Perhaps I'll try this yogurt.

06:04.222 --> 06:06.223
That's been in there
since our wedding.

06:06.224 --> 06:09.560
(groans)
Perhaps... I won't.

06:09.561 --> 06:11.579
(audience laughter)

06:14.041 --> 06:15.283
Peter, admit it.

06:15.284 --> 06:17.068
You're still in love with Lois.

06:17.069 --> 06:19.195
Yeah, every time you see her,
you go, "Schwing!"

06:19.196 --> 06:20.905
Which is, like, the sound

06:20.906 --> 06:22.716
of being lifted by a boner,
I think.

06:22.717 --> 06:25.218
Yeah, but we decided
we wanted to see other people.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.870
That's only 'cause she got tired
of waiting around for you.

06:27.871 --> 06:29.389
Look, she loves you,

06:29.390 --> 06:31.749

<i>and, a few months later,</i>

06:38.641 --> 06:40.049
<i>I bought a ring.</i>

06:40.050 --> 06:43.427
So, did you enjoy
your pesto with pesto?

06:43.428 --> 06:45.821
Does this smile
give you your answer?

06:47.599 --> 06:50.151
Lois, there's something
I want to ask you.

06:50.152 --> 06:52.770
Will you marry me?

06:52.771 --> 06:55.231
Oh, Peter,
I'm-I'm so sorry, but...

06:55.232 --> 06:57.900
I'm already engaged
to Tom Tucker.

06:57.901 --> 06:59.827
Passed over for Tom Tucker?

06:59.828 --> 07:01.570
That's terrible.

07:04.074 --> 07:06.092
- Meh.
- Oh. Huh.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.077
Okay, well, what would you think
if I told you

07:08.078 --> 07:10.263
that Blossom would completely
drop out of show business

07:10.264 --> 07:12.173
to get a PhD in neuroscience

07:12.174 --> 07:14.842
and then come back
and make $15 million a year,

07:14.843 --> 07:17.011
while you would work steadily
for 20 years,

07:17.012 --> 07:18.846
lose all your hair
and go bankrupt?

07:18.847 --> 07:20.965

<i>So I decided I was gonna do</i>
<i>the most powerful thing</i>

08:45.483 --> 08:47.150
<i>you could do in the '90s:</i>

08:47.151 --> 08:48.485
<i>make a mixtape.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:50.487
Again, Peter,
it's your mixtape,

08:50.488 --> 08:53.323
but you've got "Cotton Eye Joe"
as song number two,

08:53.324 --> 08:55.158
number four, seven and eight.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.585
You think it should be
number three as well?

08:56.586 --> 08:57.661
No!

08:57.662 --> 08:59.663
<i>I made it number three as well.</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:01.331
Oh, Peter, I got to say,

09:01.332 --> 09:03.851
the fourth and fifth time
I heard "Cotton Eye Joe,"

09:03.852 --> 09:05.519
it really got to me.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.838
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>I was so happy.</i>

09:07.839 --> 09:09.264
<i>I knew Peter was the one</i>

09:09.265 --> 09:11.859
<i>I wanted to spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with.</i>

09:11.860 --> 09:14.362
<i>But I dreaded having</i>
<i>to tell my father.</i>

09:14.363 --> 09:17.439
<i>Luckily, he was remarkably</i>
<i>understanding about it.</i>

09:17.440 --> 09:20.225
I've decided to be remarkably
understanding about this.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.110
Really?

09:21.111 --> 09:22.519
Yes. And to prove it,

09:22.520 --> 09:24.705
I'm going to pay
for Peter's bachelor party

09:24.706 --> 09:26.207
at the MTV Beach House.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.400
And I promise
it's not part of a ruse

09:28.401 --> 09:30.878
to destroy your affection
for Peter once and for all.

09:30.879 --> 09:32.621
Oh, Daddy, thank you!

09:32.622 --> 09:34.048
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>I was thrilled.</i>

09:34.049 --> 09:36.533
<i>Not only was</i>
<i>Carter letting me marry Lois,</i>

09:36.534 --> 09:39.870
<i>but this was gonna be</i>
<i>the ultimate bachelor party.</i>

09:39.871 --> 09:41.964
<i>The MTV Beach House was located</i>

09:41.965 --> 09:44.416
<i>in the most hepatitis-rich part</i>
<i>of Florida,</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:46.101
<i>known as Florida.</i>

09:47.137 --> 09:48.420
Whassup?!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.139
(chuckles)
Commercials.

09:50.140 --> 09:52.400
No skipping those yet.

09:52.401 --> 09:55.051
<i>We partied the same way</i>
<i>everyone in the '90s did,</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:56.937
<i>spaced apart by a few feet,</i>

09:56.938 --> 09:58.814
<i>dancing on our own.</i>

09:58.815 --> 10:01.266
<i>JOE:</i>
<i>Yeah, I was pretty much</i>
<i>the coolest guy there.</i>

10:01.267 --> 10:02.910
<i>With the best legs.</i>

10:02.911 --> 10:05.395
<i>There were these other idiots</i>
<i>there having a bachelor party,</i>

10:05.396 --> 10:06.897
<i>but I didn't know 'em.</i>
<i>They were losers.</i>

10:06.898 --> 10:08.940
<i>- PETER: Joe?</i>
<i>- JOE: Who's that? Peter?</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.901
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>Yeah, get out of my story.</i>
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

10:10.902 --> 10:14.404
<i>JOE:</i>
<i>I'm telling the story of</i>
<i>my days at the MTV Beach House.</i>

10:14.405 --> 10:15.947
<i>You get out of</i> my <i> story!</i>

10:15.948 --> 10:18.258
<i>I'm about to tell</i>
<i>how I met Daria.</i>

10:19.594 --> 10:23.097
So, you partying hard
or hardly partying?

10:23.098 --> 10:24.840
Hardly interested.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.124
You're mean!

10:26.125 --> 10:28.251

<i>PETER:</i>
<i>I even got to meet my heroes,</i>

<i>Mark McGrath, Pauly Shore</i>
<i>and Jamie Kennedy,</i>

10:38.188 --> 10:39.763

10:39.764 --> 10:41.598
Guys, come be in my wedding.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.859
Then we can all enter the 2000s
together as friends.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.953
Sorry, Peter,
but we can't go with you.

10:45.954 --> 10:47.455
We're not allowed
in the 2000s.

10:47.456 --> 10:50.232
Yeah, we have to stay back here
in the '90s.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.200
Goodbye, Peter.

10:51.201 --> 10:52.817
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>And then,</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:55.779
<i>they all walked into the sea</i>
<i>and disappeared forever.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:57.206
Tell the world about us!

10:57.207 --> 10:58.540
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>I planned to,</i>

10:58.541 --> 11:00.492
<i>but then I found</i>
<i>a half-eaten hot dog</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:02.827
<i>that only had a little bit</i>
<i>of sand on it.</i>

11:02.828 --> 11:04.996
<i>And most of the sand</i>
<i>was very brushable.</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:07.499
<i>You can pretty much wash</i>
<i>a hot dog with soap and water,</i>

11:07.500 --> 11:08.976
<i>and you can still eat it.</i>

11:08.977 --> 11:11.962
<i>I danced for eight hours</i>
<i>straight on</i> The Grind,

11:11.963 --> 11:14.556
<i>occasionally going</i>
<i>into the pool to pee.</i>

11:14.557 --> 11:16.466
<i>Also, for some reason,</i>
<i>I was the only guy</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:18.635
<i>-a bee was following</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>
-(buzzing)

11:18.636 --> 11:20.804
<i>Maybe it was 'cause of the</i>
<i>Country Time Lemonade powder</i>

11:20.805 --> 11:23.014
<i>I'd been eating,</i>
<i>or 'cause me and Quagmire</i>

11:23.015 --> 11:25.016
<i>were huckin' Capri Suns</i>
<i>at each other.</i>

11:25.017 --> 11:27.328
<i>But little did I know,</i>
<i>while I was dancing</i>

11:27.329 --> 11:29.163
<i>and periodically</i>
<i>peeing in the pool,</i>

11:29.164 --> 11:31.499
<i>Carter was orchestrating a plan</i>

11:31.500 --> 11:34.985
<i>to destroy my relationship</i>
<i>with your mom once and for all.</i>

11:34.986 --> 11:36.861
Hey, you're Daisy Fuentes.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.673
Oh,<i> that's</i> how
I say my last name.

11:39.674 --> 11:42.084
You're the hottest girl
of 1990-this.

11:42.085 --> 11:44.202
I've got a proposition for you.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.887

11:49.017 --> 11:51.835
Hey, there. You're all that

11:51.836 --> 11:53.762
What a cool phrase.

11:53.763 --> 11:56.765
I hope it never sounds dumb
and dated.

11:56.766 --> 11:58.359

(crowd cheering, whistling)

11:59.885 --> 12:01.845

12:01.846 --> 12:05.533
Look, Peter's wrestling
with Daisy Foo-en-taze!

12:05.534 --> 12:06.850

12:10.354 --> 12:12.689
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:16.568
Oh. We're having fun
'cause it's not 9/11 yet. Mmm.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.361
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>But the next thing I knew,</i>

12:18.362 --> 12:20.363
<i>I was kissing Daisy Fuentes.</i>

12:20.364 --> 12:23.700
<i>And it was</i>
<i>on national television.</i>

12:23.701 --> 12:26.295
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>I was home doing</i>
<i>what girls did at the time--</i>

12:26.296 --> 12:28.556
<i>looking at pictures</i>
<i>of John Elway.</i>

12:28.557 --> 12:31.708
(sighs)
My horse-toothed dreamboat.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.585
Denver looks beautiful.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.047
(gasps)
Peter?! How could you?!

12:37.048 --> 12:39.857
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>My heart shattered</i>
<i>the moment I saw it.</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:45.739
<i>I took your father's mixtape</i>
<i>and hucked it into the ocean.</i>

12:45.740 --> 12:49.434
<i>Right then and there, I vowed</i>
<i>I would never see him again.</i>

12:49.435 --> 12:50.652
(laughs)

12:50.653 --> 12:51.745
She said "wood."

12:51.746 --> 12:53.322
(laughs)

12:53.323 --> 12:54.898
That was cool.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.658
Yeah. Wood! Wood!

12:56.659 --> 12:59.110
You're right! Wood.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.004
(laughter)

13:03.282 --> 13:05.300
(laughter continues)

13:06.502 --> 13:08.511
(laughter)

13:16.104 --> 13:19.255
Daddy, tell us more
about the black '90s.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.775
Well, Magic Johnson got AIDS,
and I was like, "What?!"

13:21.776 --> 13:24.928
But then, he came back the
next season and scored 30 points

13:24.929 --> 13:27.305
in a game
where no one would touch him.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.141
And he caught it through
heterosexual sex contact?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.286
Well, that <i> is</i> magic.

13:32.287 --> 13:34.646
(laughs)
Terrific. Thank you, Cleveland.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.940
And thank you
to the entire Brown family,

13:36.941 --> 13:39.109
whose last name escapes me
at the moment.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.652
(laughs)
Terrific.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.945
Thanks, Dad.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.372
Now back to your story.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.466
I had just lost the love
of my life.

13:45.467 --> 13:47.659
So as a way to forget my pain,

13:47.660 --> 13:51.621
I threw myself into
a dot-com startup with Quagmire.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.641
<i>We were two ambitious</i>
<i>young entrepreneurs</i>

13:53.642 --> 13:55.717
<i>at the height</i>
<i>of the dot-com bubble.</i>

13:55.718 --> 13:58.053
Oogle? Goo goo?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.814
Gah-gah goo?
Gee-gee goo? Go... go go?

14:00.815 --> 14:03.133
Keep saying baby words, Peter.
You're onto something.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.652
We're close. We're circling it!

14:04.653 --> 14:07.846
Goo-goo gah-gah? Oo... oogle?
Ooh eee ooh ah ah?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.232
<i>Moments late, we'd found</i>
<i>a business idea destined</i>

14:10.233 --> 14:13.568
<i>to change the tech world</i>
<i>forever: Googoogle.</i>

14:13.569 --> 14:16.571
<i>A search engine for all</i>
<i>the info on the Goo Goo Dolls.</i>

14:16.572 --> 14:19.833
People are always gonna need
information about them!

14:19.834 --> 14:21.168
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>We were on our way.</i>

14:21.169 --> 14:22.836
<i>We rented office space,</i>

14:22.837 --> 14:25.673
<i>and watching it gave us</i>
<i>the idea to rent office space.</i>

14:25.674 --> 14:27.657
(laughs)
<i>Lumbergh.</i>

14:27.658 --> 14:29.659
(elevator bell dings)

14:29.660 --> 14:33.329
Uh, clearly,
we hadn't discussed the, uh,

14:33.330 --> 14:34.923
<i>tone</i> of our work environment.

14:34.924 --> 14:36.374
I should say we haven't.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.760
I thought this was
to be a place of business.

14:38.761 --> 14:40.521
<i>We got over</i>
<i>our initial differences,</i>

14:40.522 --> 14:42.380
<i>and then spent</i>
<i>the rest of the day doing</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:44.215
<i>what everybody did</i>
<i>in the '90s--</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:47.194
<i>debating what was better--</i>
Forrest Gump <i> or</i> Pulp Fiction.

14:47.195 --> 14:49.053
<i>Forrest Gump</i> is ridiculous!

14:49.054 --> 14:52.182
One guy does what he's told all
the time and makes millions.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.560
But a girl goes off, tries to be
different, gets AIDS, and dies!

14:55.561 --> 14:58.372
I find your argument shallow
and pedantic.

14:58.373 --> 14:59.707
<i>I didn't see either one.</i>

14:59.708 --> 15:01.542
<i>I saw</i> Ace Ventura <i> 50 times.</i>

15:01.543 --> 15:03.877
<i>Laughed so hard, I crapped</i>
<i>myself in the theater.</i>

15:03.878 --> 15:05.212
<i>Just thinking</i>
<i>about it now makes me...</i>

15:05.213 --> 15:06.237
<i>(laughs)</i>

15:06.238 --> 15:07.381
<i>- (loud flatulence)</i>
<i>- Ow!</i>

15:07.382 --> 15:09.240
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>Meanwhile, my wedding plans</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:10.909
<i>with Tom Tucker were back on.</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:12.577
Are you ready?
I can't believe

15:12.578 --> 15:14.412
the wedding is
just two scenes away.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.039
What's wrong, sweetie?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.750
I guess I'm just not sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.543
What if this is a mistake?

15:20.544 --> 15:23.046
Trust me, you're doing the right
thing. It's gonna be great.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.048
Now, listen, we don't have too
much time before the wedding,

15:25.049 --> 15:26.591
so I want to go over something

15:26.592 --> 15:28.051
regarding
the father-daughter dance.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.238
It goes, "Dallah-hollah
wallah-ballah-dallah Macarena,

15:31.239 --> 15:33.264
wakka-lakka-chakka-hakka-bakka
Macarena."

15:33.265 --> 15:34.766
Daddy, I don't think

15:34.767 --> 15:36.935
"The Macarena" is
the best father-daughter dance.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.437
Well, how about another song
from the '90s?

15:39.438 --> 15:42.824
¶<i> Casey would waltz</i>
<i>with the strawberry blonde</i> ¶

15:42.825 --> 15:46.736
¶<i> And the band played on...</i> ¶

15:46.737 --> 15:48.947
What? Wrong '90s?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.090
¶ ¶

15:50.091 --> 15:51.616
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>Like everything stupid</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.594
<i>in the '90s,</i>
<i>Googoogle took off.</i>

15:53.595 --> 15:56.913
<i>We celebrated in grand</i>
<i>dot-com bubble fashion:</i>

15:56.914 --> 15:58.915
<i>by having</i>
<i>an outrageous yacht party</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:00.625
<i>with lobster fights</i>
<i>and hookers.</i>

16:00.626 --> 16:02.436
<i>We did Ecstasy,</i>
<i>which was terrible for you,</i>

16:02.437 --> 16:04.462
<i>and only ever</i>
<i>made me feel fantastic.</i>

16:04.463 --> 16:06.297
<i>Kids, don't do it.</i>
<i>It's too awesome.</i>

16:06.298 --> 16:08.609
<i>They said it would burn a hole</i>
<i>in your brain,</i>

16:08.610 --> 16:10.185
<i>- but show me the hole.</i>
<i>- LOIS: Peter, that's enough.</i>

16:10.186 --> 16:12.354
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>If you hate pure,</i>
<i>unconditional love</i>

16:12.355 --> 16:14.806
<i>and experiencing the profound</i>
<i>harmony of the universe,</i>

16:14.807 --> 16:17.100
<i>definitely do not</i>
<i>try this drug.</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:19.027
<i>There's also, like,</i>
<i>a 90% chance you'll hook up,</i>

16:19.028 --> 16:20.345
<i>but really, no, don't do it.</i>

16:20.346 --> 16:21.646
<i>Even if you don't hook up,</i>
<i>you don't care.</i>

16:21.647 --> 16:23.314
<i>But you'll hook up, guaranteed.</i>

16:23.315 --> 16:25.200
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>Okay, Peter, let's move on.</i>

16:25.201 --> 16:27.202
<i>CHRIS:</i>
<i>And what was the name</i>
<i>of that drug?</i>

16:27.203 --> 16:28.653
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>But despite our success,</i>

16:28.654 --> 16:30.631
<i>something was missing.</i>

16:30.632 --> 16:32.132
Peter, we did it!

16:32.133 --> 16:34.968
What's the matter?
You still sad about Brandon Lee?

16:34.969 --> 16:37.495
Yeah. I never heard of him
before he died,

16:37.496 --> 16:39.289
but when he died, it was so sad.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.790
But also, it's Lois.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.667
She's getting married tomorrow.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.128
Somehow, all this success
feels meaningless,

16:45.129 --> 16:46.888
knowing I'm about
to lose her forever.

16:46.889 --> 16:48.723
Peter, then you need
to stop that wedding

16:48.724 --> 16:49.983
before it's too late.

16:49.984 --> 16:51.652
But we've got a business to run.

16:51.653 --> 16:53.487
You don't care
about this business.

16:53.488 --> 16:55.564
All you've ever cared about
is Lois.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.065
This is your last shot.

16:57.066 --> 16:59.401
Peter, you get to that wedding.

16:59.402 --> 17:00.810
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>They were right.</i>

17:00.811 --> 17:02.329
<i>So I decided to get there</i>

17:02.330 --> 17:04.355
<i>the way everyone got around</i>
<i>in the '90s--</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:06.316
<i>propelled by an explosion.</i>

17:06.317 --> 17:08.410
(loud explosion)

17:08.411 --> 17:10.169
(organ music playing)

17:12.364 --> 17:15.083
Do you, Lois
Commondenominator Pewterschmidt,

17:15.084 --> 17:19.329
accept this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.089
(all gasping)

17:21.089 --> 17:23.592
Peter? What the hell
are you doing here?!

17:23.593 --> 17:26.094
Lois, can I talk to you
privately?

17:26.095 --> 17:28.171
(loud explosion)

17:28.172 --> 17:30.098
What is it, Peter?

17:30.099 --> 17:32.884
Before you marry Tom, what's
the <i> Mortal Kombat</i> blood code?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.252
I keep forgetting.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.680
It's "A-B-A-C-A-B-B,"
but you can't do this now!

17:37.681 --> 17:39.223
You're ruining my wedding!

17:39.224 --> 17:40.868
Lois, if I didn't come here,

17:40.869 --> 17:42.944
I'd regret it
for the rest of my life.

17:42.945 --> 17:45.688
I know I screwed up,
and I don't deserve you,

17:45.689 --> 17:48.024
but I can't stop thinking
about you, day and night.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.360
It's been this way
since the day we met.

17:50.361 --> 17:54.072
I fell in love with you then,
and I'll never stop.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.291
Unless Daisy Fuentes
felt something?

17:56.292 --> 17:58.159
DAISY:
Uh, I didn't.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.702
Lois, you're the only woman
for me.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.054
He cheated on you!

18:01.055 --> 18:03.298
No daughter of mine is going
to marry a cheater!

18:03.299 --> 18:04.558
Daddy's right.

18:04.559 --> 18:06.584
Peter, I'm sorry,
but you blew it.

18:06.585 --> 18:10.138
I was in love with you, too,
but then you cheated on me.

18:10.139 --> 18:12.215
You kissed Daisy Fuentes.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.093
Lois, there's something
you should know.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.905
He didn't kiss me.
<i>I</i> kissed <i> him.</i>

18:17.906 --> 18:19.889
Because you felt something?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.432
Because Carter paid me.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.767
Well, that's something!

18:22.768 --> 18:24.986
Daddy... is that true?

18:24.987 --> 18:28.323
I only did it to protect you
from making a huge mistake!

18:28.324 --> 18:31.084
Lois, I may not be
as smart or as handsome

18:31.085 --> 18:33.236
as the guys
your dad wants for you,

18:33.237 --> 18:36.072
but I love you more
than all of 'em put together.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.241
That's a fact.
Just as sure

18:38.242 --> 18:41.503
as the <i> Star Wars</i> movies are
a perfect isolated trilogy,

18:41.504 --> 18:43.788
unmarred by additional canon.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.490
Oh, Peter!

18:46.491 --> 18:48.493
(organ plays "Wedding March")

18:48.494 --> 18:50.437
- Damn it, stop them!
<i>- PETER: One by one,</i>

18:50.438 --> 18:53.774
<i>members of Lois' family tried</i>
<i>to stop me, but I laid 'em out.</i>

18:53.775 --> 18:55.758
<i>There's something</i>
<i>about punching someone</i>

18:55.759 --> 18:58.261
<i>-in a church</i>
<i>that just feels good.</i>
-(yelling)

18:58.262 --> 19:00.404
(bell tolling)

19:01.473 --> 19:03.358
(loud explosion)

19:03.359 --> 19:05.977
<i>Cleveland picked us up</i>
<i>in a white Bronco.</i>

19:05.978 --> 19:07.812
(tires squealing)

19:07.813 --> 19:10.031
Why did you have
a white Bronco, Daddy?

19:10.032 --> 19:12.150
I was driving
my innocent friend O.J.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.819
and his ex-wife's head
down to Mexico.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.487
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>We eloped at Fenway Park,</i>

19:16.488 --> 19:18.614
<i>which I paid 50 grand</i>
<i>to rent out</i>

19:18.615 --> 19:20.968
<i>the day before</i>
<i>the dot-com bubble burst.</i>

19:20.969 --> 19:25.179
I now pronounce this
the last straight marriage.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.808
- (both moaning)
<i>- PETER: And I think</i>

19:27.809 --> 19:29.459
<i>I got swindled</i>
<i>on the Fenway deal</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:30.960
<i>because there was a game</i>
<i>that night.</i>

19:30.961 --> 19:33.388
- (bat clacks)
<i>- STADIUM ANNOUNCER: It's a hit!</i>

19:33.389 --> 19:36.483
<i>No! That would have been</i>
<i>the game-winning run!</i>

19:36.484 --> 19:38.509
<i>The Red Sox lose.</i>

19:38.510 --> 19:40.487
ALL:
Boo!

19:40.488 --> 19:42.047
<i>LOIS:</i>
<i>I was having serious regrets</i>

19:42.048 --> 19:44.658
<i>about my decision, but was</i>
<i>already pregnant with Meg,</i>

19:44.659 --> 19:46.684
<i>so there was no backing out.</i>

19:46.685 --> 19:47.977
ALL:
Boo!

19:47.978 --> 19:50.688
(bee buzzing)

19:50.689 --> 19:52.833
This bee's chasing me!
Somebody call Ace Ventura!

19:52.834 --> 19:54.192
- (laughs)
- (loud flatulence)

19:54.193 --> 19:56.043
Ow!

19:57.529 --> 19:59.489
(both laughing)

19:59.490 --> 20:01.532
(all three laughing)

20:01.533 --> 20:03.009
<i>Aw.</i>

20:09.374 --> 20:12.668
Wow, Mom and Dad. I feel like
I learned so much tonight.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.597
And not just about you guys,
but also about the '90s.

20:15.598 --> 20:18.382
Oh, there's a lot more to learn
about the '90, Meg.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.101
Like, for instance,
are you familiar

20:20.102 --> 20:21.844
with a band called
"Counting Crows"?

20:21.845 --> 20:24.364
I think I might have heard them
in a Starbucks.

20:24.365 --> 20:25.940
Yes, you have.

20:25.941 --> 20:29.018
Anyway, their lead singer is
this thing called Adam Duritz.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.729
He looks like if Marc Maron
had sex with a scarecrow

20:31.730 --> 20:34.023
and gave birth
to a baby made of hemp.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.400
I always thought
he looked like the Cowardly Lion

20:36.401 --> 20:39.287
in a suburban white high school
production of <i> The Wiz.</i>

20:39.288 --> 20:41.322
- That's not what that is?
- No, Chris.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.032
But actually, the joke's on us,

20:43.033 --> 20:45.576
because
this Sideshow Bob burnout slept

20:45.577 --> 20:47.912
with a primo roster
of '90s tail.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.723
- Jennifer Aniston.
- No.

20:49.724 --> 20:51.466
- Courteney Cox.
- What?!

20:51.467 --> 20:53.510
- Winona Ryder.
- That guy?!

20:53.511 --> 20:56.229
Christina Applegate,
Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.589
Ooh, this is just
making me angry.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.193
- Mary-Louise Parker.
- I hear she's difficult.
