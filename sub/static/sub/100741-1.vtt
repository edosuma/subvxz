00:09.568 --> 00:12.404
<i>Flight attendants,
please prepare for landing.</i>

00:13.238 --> 00:15.507
Oh, yeah. That's it,
that's it, that's it, baby.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.577
That is it right there.
Okay, right there,

00:18.610 --> 00:21.948
Oh, baby. Look at you.
You're so hot. You're so hot.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.783
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

00:23.816 --> 00:24.951
Ma'am, we're about to land.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.686
It's FAA regulations,

00:26.719 --> 00:28.788
you need to take your seat.

00:35.762 --> 00:38.296
<i>Flight
attendants, prepare for landing.</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:41.199
Ma'am, we really need
you to take your seat.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.803
Open the door.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.472
- What can I say.
- Ma'am.

00:49.608 --> 00:50.910
Hi.

00:52.779 --> 00:54.312
Consider it a gift.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.515
It'll redampen the dustiest

00:56.548 --> 00:58.417
of batcaves
if you get my drift.

00:59.618 --> 01:00.887
Just saying.

02:23.069 --> 02:25.570
What we want to stress,
Mr. Walker,

02:25.604 --> 02:26.939
is the unity of death.

02:27.707 --> 02:30.810
We believe this isn't
the end of your mother's life,

02:30.843 --> 02:33.079
but an opportunity
to bring together

02:33.112 --> 02:37.817
all the elements so greatly
deserved to be celebrated.

02:37.850 --> 02:41.721
As you'll see from our brochure,
we offer a variety

02:41.754 --> 02:44.657
of packages to suit every need,

02:44.690 --> 02:48.027
however turgid
or contoured they may be.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.997
Will your sister
be joining us today?

02:52.064 --> 02:55.701
My sister had an emergency
and missed her earlier flight.

02:56.535 --> 03:01.741
So, in interest of time, this is the
obit my mother wanted.

03:02.775 --> 03:04.677
This she only wanted opened
by the funeral home.

03:06.344 --> 03:11.717
And this is where, uh, well, you know,
this is where she wanted her ashes to go.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.722
She loved whales.

03:16.756 --> 03:20.760
Untraditional, yes.
But we always strive

03:20.793 --> 03:23.062
to satisfy the last wishes
of a loved one.

03:23.095 --> 03:26.032
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

03:26.799 --> 03:28.668
This is the picture
that she wanted for the paper.

03:29.401 --> 03:31.704
It was her, uh,
it was her favorite shot.

03:32.171 --> 03:35.775
Lovely. Oh, it looks like
you have another sister.

03:35.808 --> 03:36.776
That's me.

03:40.746 --> 03:45.852
Very well, then.
We'll, of course, take care of everything.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.788
Rest assured, Mr. Walker,

03:48.821 --> 03:50.957
that we at Forever and a Day

03:50.990 --> 03:52.959
will do everything in our power

03:52.992 --> 03:54.961
to create an environment

03:54.994 --> 03:57.930
as tasteful and befitting

03:57.964 --> 04:00.532
as your loved one deserves.

04:01.466 --> 04:02.601
Knock yourself out.

04:14.714 --> 04:17.116
Did anyone ever tell you
your beak's kinda fucked up?

04:18.017 --> 04:19.719
You really should talk
to your manufacturer.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.755
Who's ever heard
of a sad-faced duck?

04:24.757 --> 04:27.459
- Hello?
- <i>Daddy and I can't come to the phone right now,</i>

04:27.492 --> 04:30.062
<i>so please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

04:44.977 --> 04:48.546
<i>Congratulations.
You've made it to level five.</i>

04:48.580 --> 04:51.183
- All right, my man.
- <i>Lesson three.</i>

04:51.217 --> 04:54.619
- Give me some love.
- <i>And to really understand the root of a problem,</i>

04:54.654 --> 04:58.724
<i>you have to dig down deep
into the actual roots.</i>

04:58.758 --> 05:02.762
<i>R-O-O-T-S. Resignation,</i>

05:02.795 --> 05:07.733
<i>observation, outlook,
tenacity, and spirituality.</i>

05:07.767 --> 05:11.804
Resignation, observation,
outlook,

05:12.705 --> 05:15.241
tenacity, and spirituality.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.643
<i>That's it.
You can do it.</i>

05:18.077 --> 05:20.813
<i>Be the change. Be the change.</i>

05:20.846 --> 05:23.816
<i>Come on, say it with me.
Be the change.</i>

05:23.849 --> 05:26.618
- Be the change.
- <i>Be the change.</i>

05:26.652 --> 05:29.587
- Be the change.
- <i>Be the change.</i>

05:29.621 --> 05:33.458
- Be the change.
- <i>Again, with more tenacity.</i>

05:34.093 --> 05:35.460
<i>Be the change.</i>

05:36.195 --> 05:38.530
- Be the change.
- <i>Be the change.</i>

05:38.563 --> 05:41.667
Brandon, be the change.
Don't just want it. You gotta be it.

05:41.701 --> 05:44.804
- <i>Be the change.</i>
- Ooh. Yeah, I got this.

05:44.837 --> 05:47.707
Get off my ass, man.

05:48.808 --> 05:50.508
Be the change!

05:50.542 --> 05:51.978
You need to be the change,

05:52.011 --> 05:53.879
all right? Be the change.

06:07.927 --> 06:10.162
You know what she's gonna do.

06:10.196 --> 06:12.631
You know the bullshit
she's gonna throw your way.

06:12.665 --> 06:15.801
Just handle it. Stay calm.
Do not engage,

06:15.835 --> 06:17.269
all right? Do not engage.

06:18.738 --> 06:23.676
Just... be the change.

06:23.709 --> 06:27.947
Be the change. Just be the change.
You gotta be the change.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.614
Be the change.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.788
Holy fuck! Fucking hell, man.

06:35.821 --> 06:37.723
Careful
with the curse words, Brandon.

06:37.757 --> 06:39.557
- I'm always watching.
- Get off!

06:39.591 --> 06:42.028
- You're late.
- Actually, Star, you're late.

06:42.061 --> 06:45.131
- A Prius, Brandon? Really?
- Don't touch...

06:45.164 --> 06:47.833
Really? I mean, aren't you supposed
to be all de-gay-ified and shit?

06:47.867 --> 06:50.669
I mean, what, was the Oscar Meyer
Wiener Mobile not available?

06:50.703 --> 06:53.773
A, it's called a process,
and B, fuck you.

07:00.146 --> 07:01.847
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:02.748 --> 07:03.682
How you holding up?

07:04.183 --> 07:06.551
Shitty. You?

07:07.086 --> 07:08.087
Shitty.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.825
Well, if there's one thing
I've learned in this family,

07:12.858 --> 07:14.760
it's misery loves company.

07:15.694 --> 07:16.629
Seatbelt.

07:21.300 --> 07:27.006
Thank you. By the way, did you enjoy the
George W book I sent you for your birthday?

07:27.039 --> 07:30.843
Yeah.
Yep, uh, you could say that.

07:35.114 --> 07:38.217
- Okay. Home sweet home.
- Yep.

07:50.329 --> 07:51.630
I got this.

08:01.907 --> 08:02.908
Well, your room,

08:04.710 --> 08:07.680
your room is pretty much,
well, just like you left it.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.382
I, uh, thought
I'd make us some dinner.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.619
The 'hood.
Does it smell different?

08:15.855 --> 08:19.892
No. That's the smell
of stagnation. This is Iowa.

08:19.925 --> 08:20.993
Nothing ever changes.

08:22.128 --> 08:25.397
Oh, you, uh, you remember
Mom's little, uh, obsession?

08:26.365 --> 08:28.067
- Yeah.
- Brace yourself.

08:31.704 --> 08:33.239
She discovered EBay.

08:40.044 --> 08:42.847
- Holy batshit.
- Yeah.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.951
Brandon, what are we gonna
do with all this stuff?

08:47.386 --> 08:50.923
I don't know. We have an appointment
with Ira in the morning, so...

08:50.956 --> 08:53.726
- Ira? Is he still around?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:53.759 --> 08:56.428
I thought he would've joined a commune
with the Vienna Boys Choir or something.

08:56.462 --> 08:59.398
Nope. He's actually
taking this pretty hard.

09:00.299 --> 09:01.433
So, we can't be late.

09:05.171 --> 09:06.438
It feels strange, doesn't it?

09:12.811 --> 09:16.248
- I am gonna go get changed.
- Okay.

09:17.016 --> 09:21.053
I'll, uh, I'll get dinner.

09:25.224 --> 09:28.227
All right.
Veggie burgers here we go.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.235
Dinner's ready.

11:51.370 --> 11:52.271
Coming.

12:10.622 --> 12:12.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:13.325 --> 12:16.428
- Oh, this looks great, Brandon.
- Thanks.

12:17.129 --> 12:19.331
- It's, uh, Mom's recipe. I found her old book.
- Hmm.

12:19.365 --> 12:21.967
It's the veggie burger.
Can we, uh, just,

12:22.635 --> 12:24.903
can we
say grace before we eat?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.339
You think I'll burst
into flames or something?

12:28.340 --> 12:30.175
Please? For mom?

12:31.343 --> 12:32.244
Thank you.

12:33.813 --> 12:37.449
Dear Heavenly Father, please bless this
meal which we are about to receive.

12:37.483 --> 12:40.319
Please continue to give us
strength and guidance.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.622
Please watch over the soul
of our dearly departed mother.

12:45.324 --> 12:48.060
- Amen.
- A-woman.

12:48.093 --> 12:50.262
- Do you always have to be so irreverent?
- Do you always have to have

12:50.295 --> 12:52.665
- a stick so firmly shoved up your rectum?
- Okay. So...

12:54.066 --> 12:56.703
- enough with the gay stuff.
- I'm just trying to add a little levity, Brandon.

12:56.736 --> 12:58.537
It's not like anyone
died or anything.

13:01.006 --> 13:02.141
Tough crowd.

13:07.045 --> 13:09.615
- So how's it all going?
- What?

13:11.016 --> 13:12.017
The cult thing?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.289
- You mean the program?
- The cult, program, whatever.

13:17.322 --> 13:19.258
The thing where you all
shave your head,

13:19.291 --> 13:21.059
sit in a circle and sing
Kumbaya while you're trying

13:21.093 --> 13:22.662
to exorcise
the Lady Gaga out of you.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.330
Not that you deserve to know,

13:26.598 --> 13:29.368
- but it's good actually. Thank you.
- Good.

13:29.401 --> 13:31.671
Things are going good. I've made
a lot of distinct strides.

13:31.704 --> 13:33.405
A lot of big changes.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.042
I've had to step away
recently 'cause of the...

13:37.075 --> 13:40.512
because of the cost, but, uh,
I made it level five.

13:40.546 --> 13:42.481
- Level five?
- Mm-hmm.

13:42.514 --> 13:44.049
Level five.
It's a crucial level.

13:44.717 --> 13:47.586
That's the level where you
finally become at peace

13:47.619 --> 13:49.188
with who you are.

13:51.190 --> 13:52.224
Gay.

13:53.525 --> 13:54.526
No, Star.

13:55.628 --> 13:59.431
Like I've said, no one's really
gay anymore, okay?

13:59.465 --> 14:02.735
Society is confused. We're getting
things thrown at us from all angles.

14:02.769 --> 14:06.371
- Social media, technology. We're all confused.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.405 --> 14:07.573
And I was just...

14:09.308 --> 14:11.076
I was just
a little lost, okay?

14:11.778 --> 14:14.714
- And now?
- Now, uh...

14:17.516 --> 14:20.352
well, I gotta complete
level five still, so...

14:27.694 --> 14:30.496
- How about you?
- Oh, I'm good. Yeah.

14:30.529 --> 14:34.166
I'm, um, thinking of moving
again, probably overseas.

14:34.199 --> 14:35.501
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:35.534 --> 14:37.336
- What about Chelsea?
- Well,

14:37.369 --> 14:39.104
her dad and I
aren't really seeing

14:39.137 --> 14:40.773
eye-to-eye on visitation
rights right now.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.543
I have no money
for a lawyer and, uh,

14:44.576 --> 14:48.347
he says that, um, she doesn't
even wanna see me, so...

14:50.249 --> 14:51.550
Sorry to hear that.

14:52.618 --> 14:54.687
Sorry to hear
you're stuck on level five.

14:55.788 --> 14:57.055
Yeah, me too.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.326
You know what
we need, Brandon?

15:03.328 --> 15:05.330
- What?
- One word.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.265
What?

15:07.165 --> 15:09.134
- You know.
- I don't. Where are you going?

15:09.167 --> 15:10.235
One second.

15:15.173 --> 15:17.644
Vinyl. Ain't nothing
like it, baby. And...

15:18.577 --> 15:20.813
- um, where'd she put it. Ah!
- Oh, no.

15:20.847 --> 15:22.614
Mom's famous hooch squeezed

15:22.649 --> 15:25.117
between every one
of her bipolar little toes.

15:25.150 --> 15:27.486
- No. I really shouldn't, okay?
- Au contraire, Brandon.

15:27.519 --> 15:29.254
You most definitely should.

15:29.288 --> 15:34.526
Life is short. Just ask Mom.
She's dead.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.329
Yes. Thank you.
That's plenty.

15:37.362 --> 15:38.530
- You want a little more?
- No, that's enough.

15:39.298 --> 15:41.634
- Do you remember the smell?
- Yes, it's awful.

15:41.668 --> 15:43.870
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, baby. Come to Mama.

15:43.903 --> 15:46.338
- It smells like gasoline.
- Ah!

15:49.508 --> 15:51.276
- To Mom.
- To Mom.

15:53.746 --> 15:54.781
Mm.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.693
Really? I don't even...
the horse, right?

16:07.359 --> 16:10.362
Cheers.
What are you doing?

16:10.395 --> 16:14.600

18:04.576 --> 18:07.579
You know? Same.

18:09.514 --> 18:11.616
You know what she said to me
before she died?

18:12.885 --> 18:13.886
What'd she say?

18:14.887 --> 18:19.357
She said, "Look at this thing
destroying me

18:19.391 --> 18:22.695
from the inside out, Star.
You two have a lot in common."

18:22.729 --> 18:25.263
- That's what she said.
- Star, she was joking.

18:25.297 --> 18:26.766
- She was joking.
- Yeah. That was Mom,

18:26.799 --> 18:32.638
- always joking.
- Ah. That was fun.

18:32.672 --> 18:35.507
You know, any good shrink
will tell you

18:36.075 --> 18:37.609
that Mom had cock issues.

18:40.012 --> 18:43.281
- Ex-excuse me?
- Yeah.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.952
Think about it. She couldn't hold a
healthy relationship down with a guy,

18:46.652 --> 18:54.292
so she surrounded herself with
these big blubbery flashy cocks.

18:54.326 --> 18:57.897
- Okay, you're deranged.
- Don't you think some of these even affected you, right?

18:57.930 --> 19:01.600
I mean, you literally grew up in
a house with all of these things

19:01.634 --> 19:03.870
looking at you no matter where
you went. I mean, no wonder

19:03.903 --> 19:05.872
you loathe
what you can't do without.

19:05.905 --> 19:10.442
- Look at all these whales.
- Why are we back here again?

19:10.475 --> 19:12.812
For the last time,
I'm not gonna say it again.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.548
- I am not gay.
- Yeah.

19:16.581 --> 19:19.417
And bats
don't shit in the dark.

19:20.086 --> 19:22.789
Come on, Brandon, I'm just
telling it like it is.

19:22.822 --> 19:26.826
Oh. Okay.
If we're telling it like it is,

19:26.859 --> 19:29.962
how about telling me why your daughter
wants nothing to do with you, huh?

19:30.630 --> 19:32.098
- What?
- You heard me.

19:32.131 --> 19:33.866
I mean, can you blame her?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.936
Between the ever-revolving
door of boyfriends

19:36.969 --> 19:40.572
and the constant need to move
every few months, I mean,

19:41.140 --> 19:44.476
you've done a pretty bang up job of putting
a solid wall between the two of you.

19:44.509 --> 19:46.879
- A wall? If that isn't the pot calling the kettle black.
- A fucking wall.

19:46.913 --> 19:49.715
What's the petal and the black?
What does that even mean?

19:49.749 --> 19:51.784
If you're talking
about a wall, Brandon,

19:51.818 --> 19:54.386
you are the most prolific
builder of them all.

19:54.419 --> 19:58.124
You're a gay republican!
A fucking gay republican.

19:58.157 --> 20:01.828
I mean, that's a fucking
oxymoron if ever there was one.

20:01.861 --> 20:05.463
- I mean, come on!
- For the last time,

20:05.932 --> 20:09.467
- I'm not gay!
- Yeah. Tell that to all the yogurt slingers

20:09.501 --> 20:12.437
you've had an up close and personal
with since you hit adolescence.

20:12.470 --> 20:17.844
- I'm just telling it like it is.
- That's fucking it. That's it.

20:17.877 --> 20:19.712
- What are you doing?
- That's it, get up.

20:19.745 --> 20:21.781
- Why are you walking in circles?
- Come on.

20:21.814 --> 20:24.449
- We're do this right here.
- Are you challenging me?

20:24.482 --> 20:27.019
That's it. Come on,
I'm not joking. Get up, come on.

20:27.053 --> 20:30.022
Are you challenging me?
What are you doing?

20:30.056 --> 20:33.125
Stretches. No Tai Chi now.
It's not the same as before.

20:33.159 --> 20:35.094
You remember what happened
the last time we did this?

20:35.127 --> 20:37.462
Yeah. I was a little fucking boy
then. Now I'm grown.

20:37.495 --> 20:38.998
- Remember, right?
- Yeah, I remember.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.967
- Look at me now. I'm grown.
- Grown no,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.102
I don't think you know
the true nature of a scrapper.

20:43.135 --> 20:44.871
- Yeah. 'Cause if you did...
- Just stay away.

20:44.904 --> 20:47.173
Yeah. I think if you did,
you would lay down

20:47.206 --> 20:48.841
and save us both the trouble.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.143
- Get off!
- Oh, my God.

20:51.177 --> 20:54.446
- Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
- Get off my tit, would you?

20:54.479 --> 20:57.116
- Ah!
- You're just jealous 'cause Mom loved me more.

20:57.149 --> 21:02.088
No. You're just jealous
because I have a vagina!

21:02.121 --> 21:04.991
Ah! Ow!

21:06.458 --> 21:09.896
For the last time,
Star, I'm not gay!

21:15.001 --> 21:17.837
I'm so sorry for your loss.

21:18.938 --> 21:21.107
You don't know how much
your mother meant to me.

21:27.847 --> 21:31.751
Oh. Well, I guess
we should just jump right in.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.722
Now, before I read anything,

21:37.522 --> 21:39.191
I want to say
that your mother

21:40.726 --> 21:43.428
was a very special
and unique woman.

21:47.934 --> 21:49.068
Stop it.

21:51.704 --> 21:54.941
"I, Clair Samantha Walker,

21:55.641 --> 21:57.910
of sound mind and body..."

21:57.944 --> 21:59.712
As soon as I'm done here,
I'm gone.

21:59.745 --> 22:01.513
I'll be first in line
to help pack.

22:01.546 --> 22:02.915
"Do hereby bequeath,

22:02.949 --> 22:04.884
all my personal effects,

22:04.917 --> 22:07.019
savings
and tangible property..."

22:07.053 --> 22:09.188
- You're such a tool.
- You're such a bitch.

22:09.221 --> 22:12.858
"...equally
to both my children,

22:13.525 --> 22:18.264
Star Elizabeth Walker and Brandon
Tyler Walker, respectively."

22:18.297 --> 22:21.200
- See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.
- Don't let the door hit you in your ass, okay?

22:21.233 --> 22:22.868
Stop it!

22:22.902 --> 22:25.004
I should let you know,

22:27.106 --> 22:28.708
there's a catch.

22:32.544 --> 22:36.782
In order for the property to be
divided equally between both parties,

22:36.816 --> 22:40.286
your mother
has requested the following.

22:40.319 --> 22:43.488
"My dearest poochies,

22:44.223 --> 22:47.126
while I don't have much
to offer in way of my legacy,

22:47.159 --> 22:51.998
I do have the house,
my whale collection..." Oh!

22:52.031 --> 22:54.633
"...and the Winnebago."
The Sin-a-bago.

22:54.667 --> 22:58.671
"And a small pittance
of savings in the bank.

22:58.704 --> 23:01.573
It is my wish you will do
what you will with it,

23:01.606 --> 23:05.610
with my blessings, to hopefully make
your situation that much better.

23:05.644 --> 23:09.281
Lord knows you each need help
in a myriad of ways.

23:09.315 --> 23:15.520
My only contingency, is that
you take my ashes, and...

23:18.324 --> 23:20.626
intern them in the body
of a whale."

23:21.994 --> 23:23.561
What the fuck?

23:24.764 --> 23:26.932
- What do you mean?
- "It's my final wish

23:26.966 --> 23:29.135
that the remnants
of this vessel that failed me,

23:29.168 --> 23:33.272
will become one with our mammal
brethren of the deep.

23:33.305 --> 23:36.776
If you complete this request,
what's mine, is yours.

23:36.809 --> 23:40.012
If not, deal's off
and you get squat.

23:40.046 --> 23:42.314
ASPCA gets everything else.

23:42.348 --> 23:46.285
It's pretty simple. Rules are,
no flying and you must go together.

23:47.053 --> 23:50.923
Oh, and you have 48 hours
to do it. Good luck. And...

23:50.956 --> 23:53.993
- try not to kill each other."
- Mr. Rhodes,

23:54.026 --> 23:56.896
my mom was pretty eccentric.
I don't think she would have...

23:56.929 --> 24:00.699
Signed and notarized.
These were, in fact, her final wishes.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.368
"In the body of a whale"?
What are we supposed to do,

24:02.401 --> 24:03.769
piss off God
and be swallowed by one?

24:04.270 --> 24:06.238
Well, she also left you this.

24:09.308 --> 24:13.179
Mr. Rhodes, hi.
Um, as much as I appreciate

24:13.212 --> 24:15.948
Mom's final desire
to be whale food,

24:15.981 --> 24:18.616
my brother and I
need this inheritance

24:18.651 --> 24:20.753
- for various personal issues, okay?
- Yeah.

24:20.786 --> 24:25.691
You know, your mother was
really something special to me.

24:25.724 --> 24:29.995
- What do you mean?
- Me and a bunch of other local

24:30.029 --> 24:34.200
free spirits, she would run
around on various solstices,

24:34.233 --> 24:36.669
you know,
howling at the moon

24:36.702 --> 24:39.038
and whatnot, naked running
around a campfire.

24:39.071 --> 24:40.039
Boy, that was something to see.

24:41.740 --> 24:47.346
I'll never forget the first time I saw your
mother's bosoms naked for the first time,

24:47.379 --> 24:49.715
- glistening in the moonlight.
- What the fuck is he talking about?

24:49.748 --> 24:52.651
Two nipples erect
like two silver bullets

24:52.685 --> 24:56.088
pointing to the heavens.
That woman could make

24:56.122 --> 24:59.391
a man Wendingo at a moments
notice, just ah ah.

24:59.425 --> 25:03.062
Just fully cocked and erect
and ready to take her

25:03.095 --> 25:05.364
like the wild wood nymph
she was.

25:05.397 --> 25:07.032
Uh...

25:10.703 --> 25:12.738
- All right.
- Look, what you do

25:12.771 --> 25:14.173
with your mother's assets
is your own business.

25:14.206 --> 25:16.442
My only horse in this race,

25:16.475 --> 25:19.044
is to be sure that you fulfill
the obligations

25:19.078 --> 25:20.913
that your mother's requested.

25:21.747 --> 25:24.283
That's the least
I could do for her.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.118
So I'm here to tell you what.

25:26.152 --> 25:29.755
This will be done
or no dice.

25:31.891 --> 25:33.058
You got me?

25:34.894 --> 25:38.731
You got me? Good.

25:39.965 --> 25:45.404
Good. Well, I will need
periodic photographic updates

25:45.437 --> 25:47.406
to keep me abreast of your
progress, and, of course,

25:47.439 --> 25:50.409
I'll need proof that
the ashes have reached their...

25:51.277 --> 25:52.344
intended destination.

25:54.513 --> 25:57.850
All right.
Well, your time starts now.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.353
Good luck, and I look forward
to hearing from you,

26:01.387 --> 26:04.123
and I hope
you can have a nice day,

26:05.257 --> 26:06.425
poochies.

26:11.764 --> 26:15.267
We'll grab some things from the house, go to the
funeral home, snag the ashes and get going.

26:15.301 --> 26:17.336
You're not actually thinking
of doing this, are you?

26:17.369 --> 26:19.338
Do we have a choice?
You heard him.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.840
These were her final wishes.
We have to honor that.

26:21.874 --> 26:25.044
Final wishes, Brandon? Mom also
wished you were the daughter

26:25.077 --> 26:28.113
she never had, okay?
You were this close to being one

26:28.147 --> 26:30.416
of those kid gender reassignment horror
stories you hear about on the news.

26:30.449 --> 26:33.919
Honestly, the idea of spending
two days with you in a car

26:33.953 --> 26:36.789
makes me wanna Oedipal my own
eyeballs. But let me be frank,

26:37.456 --> 26:38.991
I need
to get to level five,

26:40.359 --> 26:43.929
and I'm broke. Okay?
I really need this money,

26:43.963 --> 26:45.798
and so do you.

26:47.199 --> 26:48.767
Please, Star.

26:51.837 --> 26:54.039
- Who's Frank?
- What?

26:54.073 --> 26:56.809
You said you wanted
to be Frank. Who's Frank?

26:57.843 --> 27:01.080
- I don't understand.
- It's a joke, Brandon.

27:01.947 --> 27:04.316
Jesus, this is it's gonna be
a long two days.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.852
Could you please refrain from
using the Lord's name in vain.

27:06.885 --> 27:09.822
Oh, my God.
A very long two days.

27:10.422 --> 27:15.327
Seatbelt. By the way,
we can't take the Prius.

27:15.361 --> 27:18.430
- What? Why?
- My lease is almost up,

27:18.464 --> 27:20.099
and I can't afford
to put the miles on it.

27:20.132 --> 27:22.334
- So what are we driving?
- Nostalgia.

27:44.523 --> 27:47.059
At least if we run out of dough,
we can always sleep in here.

27:50.095 --> 27:51.997
Yeah, not really.

27:52.031 --> 27:53.565
Mom had the whole thing
cleared out. Look.

27:53.599 --> 27:55.000
Beds and all.

27:55.968 --> 27:58.337
- Do what?
- Yeah. She used it to deliver animals

27:58.370 --> 28:01.940
for the ASPCA, so that's why
the, uh, cages.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.344
- What's with all the spray paint?
- What? Oh.

28:06.312 --> 28:10.983
The spray paint, uh,
that was her little protest anarchy group.

28:11.517 --> 28:14.286
Her protest anarchy
what, Brandon?

28:14.320 --> 28:17.056
The whole, you know,
save the animals thing.

28:17.089 --> 28:20.225
If anyone in town did anything
to hurt an animal, then

28:20.259 --> 28:22.861
in came Mom and her merry gang
of tricksters,

28:22.895 --> 28:26.598
- and busted out the spray paint.
- Good to know Mom was a tagger.

28:26.633 --> 28:30.269
- Yeah.
- How much confidence do you have that this bucket

28:30.302 --> 28:32.871
- will actually make it?
- This old girl?

28:33.605 --> 28:35.908
I'm cautiously
optimistic actually.

28:39.211 --> 28:41.280
We're so getting stranded

28:41.313 --> 28:44.283
and gang raped by a clan
of rabid hillbillies

28:44.316 --> 28:45.918
somewhere in the Ozarks.

28:45.951 --> 28:48.187
Socially sensitive as always.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.922
- Nice.
- Again, it's a joke, Brandon.

28:49.955 --> 28:52.458
- It's not a joke.
- My God.

28:52.491 --> 28:55.394
It's like your funny bone
disappeared right around adolescence.

28:56.128 --> 28:59.031
- About the time you started getting your period.
- That's not how it is, okay?

28:59.064 --> 29:01.100
We just have a slight
difference of opinion

29:01.133 --> 29:03.035
as to what funny is, okay?

29:03.068 --> 29:05.571
Rape is not funny.

29:05.604 --> 29:08.574
Rape by itself, Brandon,
isn't funny. Okay?

29:08.607 --> 29:11.343
Rape brought on
by an absurd road trip

29:11.377 --> 29:13.545
to bury your mother's ashes
in the body of a whale

29:13.579 --> 29:16.315
with your brother who hates you
and your shitkicker RV stalls

29:16.348 --> 29:18.651
in the middle of nowhere, where
some toothless roaming gang

29:18.685 --> 29:20.986
of Manson-family rejects
has their way with you,

29:21.019 --> 29:22.988
now that is funny.

29:29.194 --> 29:31.230
- I don't hate you, Star.
- What?

29:32.598 --> 29:34.933
I don't hate you. I just...

29:36.135 --> 29:38.036
I don't understand
you sometimes.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.105
Well, I don't exactly
have you nailed down either.

29:40.139 --> 29:43.475
- No.
- My guess is one of us is adopted.

29:44.576 --> 29:45.477
Yeah.

29:51.283 --> 29:53.285
Oh, my God. Muffler Man.

29:53.318 --> 29:56.088
- What?
- Muffler Man. Over there. Over there.

29:56.121 --> 29:57.589
Turn, turn, turn.
It's the Muffler Man!

29:57.623 --> 30:00.192
- Over there! Just turn!
- All right.

30:00.225 --> 30:02.461
- It's not that hard. You just gotta turn.
- Okay, okay.

30:02.494 --> 30:05.497
- Do you want me to help you turn the wheel?
- Get off the wheel.

30:05.531 --> 30:08.567
- Star.
- It's so easy. Just go like this.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.036
- All right. Quickly, okay?
- Yeah. Just so quick.

30:11.069 --> 30:14.406
Nothing bad's gonna happen.
Give me the keys.

30:15.207 --> 30:16.442
Whoo!

30:19.511 --> 30:22.682
- What are we doing here?
- Evidence. Come on.

30:25.752 --> 30:28.020
- Star.
- Come on. Look!

30:28.053 --> 30:31.089
Who said there's no culture
in middle America, huh?

30:31.123 --> 30:33.091
- We really need to get back on the road.
- Look at that.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.661
- Look at that.
- What is that?

30:34.694 --> 30:35.695
- Come over here.
- Why?

30:35.728 --> 30:36.995
Stop right there.

30:37.029 --> 30:39.164
Don't move.

30:40.633 --> 30:43.135
Okay. Say cheese.

30:44.269 --> 30:46.338
Come on, Brandon,
don't be a party pooper.

30:46.371 --> 30:48.540
This the family road trip
you always wanted. Just move.

30:48.574 --> 30:50.609
Just that way, just a little
to the left. That way.

30:50.643 --> 30:51.711
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

30:52.611 --> 30:55.715
- And catch!
- What the heck is that?

30:56.515 --> 30:59.351
One thing I can count on, Bran Bran,
your utter lack of athleticism.

30:59.384 --> 31:01.119
What are you doing?
What was that for?

31:01.153 --> 31:04.056
Having a great time, Mr. Rhodes.

31:04.089 --> 31:08.026
Wish you were here,
especially Brandon.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.429
- Wait.
- X-O, X-O.

31:10.462 --> 31:12.531
- What? You're not sending...
- Sent.

31:12.564 --> 31:16.001
- Yeah. Let's go get a Slurpee.
- I don't wanna get a...

32:11.256 --> 32:13.458
Do you ever wonder
what it's all really about?

32:16.261 --> 32:20.332
Seriously? Did someone slip a cliché
pill in your drink this morning, huh?

32:21.166 --> 32:23.636
Don't tell me you're actually having
a pang of meaning and purpose?

32:23.670 --> 32:28.273
Yep. And it's sitting in my colon right
next to my heat lamp bean burrito.

32:28.307 --> 32:29.241
That's disgusting.

32:30.576 --> 32:31.811
Seriously,
what's your take?

32:33.913 --> 32:36.515
Well, I mean,
if you really wanna know,

32:39.484 --> 32:43.221
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
It's... it's... it's confusing.

32:44.323 --> 32:46.358
There's... there's lots...
lots going on, you know?

32:49.261 --> 32:50.329
That's your answer?

32:51.764 --> 32:54.867
Your agnostic sister
just opened Pandora's Biblebox

32:54.901 --> 32:58.103
to talk about Jesus, life,
and all that BS, and your answer

32:58.871 --> 33:01.506
- is "I'm not exactly sure"?
- Well, I'm not.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.810
Jesus, delusional much,
Brandon?

33:03.843 --> 33:06.813
- Can you stop using his name...
- FYI, when I say his name,

33:06.846 --> 33:09.581
it's not because I'm cursing
him. It's because I see him

33:09.615 --> 33:13.418
sitting there on your shoulder,
like this little miniature

33:13.452 --> 33:15.755
- white-robed Jesus cockatoo.
- What?

33:15.788 --> 33:18.423
And you should feel
so cool, Brandon.

33:18.457 --> 33:21.928
You're like the Beretta
of born-again Christians.

33:21.961 --> 33:24.631
Beretta? Isn't that a gun?

33:27.566 --> 33:30.535
- How long till our next stop?
- Not soon enough, okay?

33:30.569 --> 33:32.337
So just let me drive.

34:11.777 --> 34:15.280
- Look at that church.
- No one wants to go to church.

34:15.313 --> 34:16.983
- Just saying, nice church.
- It's Tuesday.

34:17.016 --> 34:18.516
It's a nice church.

34:19.018 --> 34:20.552
Do you go to church
every Sunday?

34:20.585 --> 34:22.387
- Yeah.
- Every Sunday?

34:22.420 --> 34:24.690
When was the last time
you went to church, Star?

34:24.724 --> 34:27.458
- I would burn when I walked in.
- Just leave it, all right?

34:27.492 --> 34:29.360
I don't want to talk to you
about this anymore.

34:29.829 --> 34:31.797
- Look!
- Yeah.

34:31.831 --> 34:33.632
- Oh, my God.
- So what? It's not that cool.

34:34.399 --> 34:36.768
- Do you smell that?
- Did you fart?

34:37.536 --> 34:39.204
I'm not five anymore.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.708
- Was that you?
- That's a skunk.

34:41.741 --> 34:43.743
- No, I think that's you.
- It's a skunk, Star.

34:43.775 --> 34:46.646
- Whoever smelt it dealt it.
- It's a skunk.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.849
Look at that shit that's burning
in the distance. Do you see that?

34:49.882 --> 34:53.820
Look. I bet it's not good
for the ozone layer.

34:53.853 --> 34:56.989
Do you even fart or does it go
back up inside you?

34:57.023 --> 34:58.523
All right. Shut up.

34:59.391 --> 35:00.525
Do you tan your legs?

35:01.728 --> 35:05.898
Do you just decide
never to go out?

35:05.932 --> 35:08.366
I'm trying to even it out.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.037
- Stop looking at my shorts.
- They're so up high.

35:11.070 --> 35:12.739
I'm not talking
about your boobs or anything.

35:12.772 --> 35:14.439
They shouldn't be
like so up there.

35:14.473 --> 35:15.808
Just leave me alone.

35:15.842 --> 35:19.344
- What...
- ...in the right places.

35:19.377 --> 35:21.580
- Great landing, Brandon.
- Thank you, Star.

35:21.613 --> 35:25.517
- You know how to drive this.
- Thank you, Star.

35:26.551 --> 35:28.587
- Do you think we should, uh...
- Leave Mom?

35:28.620 --> 35:29.956
I don't think
she's going anywhere.

35:31.556 --> 35:32.992
This doesn't look
like a Motel 6.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.361
Because it's not.
It's Aunt Jackie's place.

35:36.394 --> 35:38.497
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Don't start, okay?

35:38.530 --> 35:40.933
Mom hadn't talked to Aunt Jackie
in years, Brandon.

35:40.967 --> 35:42.902
I'd venture to say
there's a good reason for that.

35:42.935 --> 35:44.904
I know, but money is tight,
all right?

35:44.937 --> 35:46.806
And she's expecting us.
She wants us here.

35:46.839 --> 35:49.407
Just be cool.
Keep your opinions to yourself.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.044
You can always stay in the van
if you don't wanna.

35:54.579 --> 35:57.016
I just figured that she
and Herr Randal would have moved

35:57.049 --> 35:59.584
down to Argentina
where Mossad couldn't find them.

35:59.618 --> 36:01.586
They're not Nazis, Star.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.790
They're social conservatives,
okay?

36:05.557 --> 36:08.527
Who aren't afraid to wear their
feelings on their sleeves...

36:08.560 --> 36:11.664
It's too bad those sleeves are attached to
flowing white robes and matching face-hoods.

36:11.697 --> 36:15.001
Listen, this would've been really important
to Mom, okay? So it's important to me.

36:15.935 --> 36:17.904
Please be nice. Here you go.

36:19.604 --> 36:21.841
All right.

36:21.874 --> 36:22.809
Smile.

36:26.545 --> 36:28.948
- Oh...
- Hello.

36:28.981 --> 36:31.550
Uh-oh, Jackie.
Lock down the neighborhood.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.020
They're letting Yankee Pinko's
in left and right!

36:34.053 --> 36:36.454
Randal, stop it.
Don't pay attention to him.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.557
Come and love
your Aunt Jackie's neck!

36:38.590 --> 36:39.759
- All right.
- Come here.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.661
I was a little bit worried

36:41.694 --> 36:44.529
it was those damn heathen
Jehovah's Witnesses again.

36:44.563 --> 36:46.398
- Hey.
- All right.

36:46.431 --> 36:48.801
Come on, Randal.
You know Jehovah Witnesses

36:48.835 --> 36:51.804
are just like Christians.
They're just a little more eccentric.

36:51.838 --> 36:54.774
They're a cult.
Them and the Mormons.

36:54.807 --> 36:58.543
In my book, anybody that dresses
alike, definitely a cult.

36:58.577 --> 37:00.512
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

37:00.545 --> 37:01.781
Star, Brandon,

37:02.882 --> 37:04.750
this is your cousin,
Little Pepe.

37:08.788 --> 37:11.057
- Our cousin.
- Little Pepe.

37:11.090 --> 37:15.027
And the operative phrase tonight,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

37:15.995 --> 37:17.797
Well, we've already eaten,

37:17.830 --> 37:20.099
but you're welcome
to join us for dessert.

37:20.967 --> 37:22.534
We waited.

37:23.102 --> 37:24.637
We made enough for five.

37:27.773 --> 37:29.742
Welcome to our home, huh?

37:29.775 --> 37:32.945
- Okay.
- Welcome to our home. Actually,

37:32.979 --> 37:36.749
<i>bienvenido a la casa</i>
<i>de</i> Hillhouse.

37:36.782 --> 37:40.019
We're learning Spanish
for little Pepe here.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.587
Uh, Randal, why don't you
take their bags upstairs,

37:42.621 --> 37:45.457
and we will go into the
dining room for dessert. Okay?

37:46.225 --> 37:48.928
That's right. Okay. Pepe,

37:49.695 --> 37:53.598
<i>me algunos platos
de la cocina, ahora.</i>

37:55.567 --> 37:56.936
<i>Andale</i>!

38:01.140 --> 38:03.776
Please come in.
<i>Mi casa es su casa</i>.

38:05.477 --> 38:07.813
Wow. It's, uh,
it's... it's a beautiful home.

38:07.847 --> 38:09.682
Thank you. Thank you.

38:09.715 --> 38:11.717
Well, you have got
your mama's eyelashes.

38:11.751 --> 38:15.154
- Look at how long they are.
- Oh, dear God.

38:15.187 --> 38:17.890
I was hoping
you would notice this.

38:17.924 --> 38:20.693
I've been collecting
for years.

38:20.726 --> 38:23.763
You know, he was in St. Joe once.
Came to christen a Walmart

38:23.796 --> 38:26.999
and Channel 6 news,
the Channel 6 news,

38:27.033 --> 38:30.136
came here to do a story
on my collection.

38:30.169 --> 38:32.171
I just want you
to both to know that God...

38:32.872 --> 38:35.775
God definitely has
a very twisted sense of humor.

38:37.209 --> 38:40.813
- I don't understand.
- Uh, Star, she just finished his autobiography.

38:41.847 --> 38:43.215
That I did, Brandon.

38:44.549 --> 38:47.720
Well, what did you think?
I mean, didn't you find it insightful?

38:49.288 --> 38:52.058
I definitely had
quite the experience with it.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.029
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.

38:57.763 --> 38:59.065
Let's sit.

39:01.834 --> 39:02.969
Let's have some <i>torta</i>.

39:03.669 --> 39:06.138
As foster parents,
we really feel

39:06.172 --> 39:09.108
it's very important
to integrate Pepe's

39:09.141 --> 39:11.777
native culture
in to his daily life.

39:11.811 --> 39:13.179
For instance,
learning the language

39:13.212 --> 39:16.682
My favorite
is Taco Thursdays.

39:18.017 --> 39:20.720
Pepe, you can go fetch
the cake now, okay?

39:20.753 --> 39:23.521
<i>La torta</i>, Pepe. <i>Ahora</i>.

39:24.256 --> 39:26.025
You are gonna love this cake.

39:26.058 --> 39:27.259
We got it
at a bakery downtown.

39:27.293 --> 39:29.628
Run by an oriental family.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.132
- I think you mean Asian family.
- No, they're not Asian.

39:33.165 --> 39:37.103
- I think they might be Chinese.
- I think they might be Japanese

39:37.136 --> 39:40.538
or, uh, Taiwanese, Vietnamese.

39:40.572 --> 39:43.042
Somewhere in the rice belt
where I don't want to go.

39:43.075 --> 39:46.645
I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really
matter. They all look the same, so...

39:46.679 --> 39:49.547
- Randal.
- What?

39:49.581 --> 39:51.583
Look, you gotta be honest
with yourself.

39:51.616 --> 39:54.120
They might look at us
and think we all look the same.

39:54.153 --> 39:57.690
- Did you ever think about that?
- They all have their own distinct cultures,

39:57.723 --> 40:00.192
histories, languages, arts.

40:00.993 --> 40:05.931
I mean, what you're saying, Uncle
Randal, is, uh, well, it's kinda racist.

40:13.005 --> 40:14.173
You know what?

40:16.075 --> 40:17.076
The boy is right.

40:18.310 --> 40:21.280
Let me tell you a true story.
When I came back to Missouri

40:21.313 --> 40:25.251
from Iraq 1,
the first place I went

40:25.284 --> 40:28.954
was the Bamboo Hut. It's right
there off U.S. Highway 50.

40:28.988 --> 40:32.557
And I ordered the specialty
of the house, cashew chicken.

40:33.292 --> 40:34.326
And then it hit me.

40:35.895 --> 40:37.296
Well, this is
what it's all about.

40:37.930 --> 40:41.100
All of it.
This is what we're fighting for.

40:41.133 --> 40:45.037
I mean, all of the military
and the fighting and the maiming

40:45.071 --> 40:48.340
and the killing,
cashew chicken.

40:48.374 --> 40:50.142
Because what is cashew chicken?

40:50.176 --> 40:52.878
It's breaded chicken
in some oyster sauce,

40:52.912 --> 40:55.047
and you sprinkle
some cashews on it. Voila.

40:55.081 --> 40:56.916
What do you have?
Exotic foreign dish.

40:56.949 --> 40:59.151
Now, you take
the same breaded chicken,

40:59.185 --> 41:02.788
and you serve it
with some Heinz 57 ketchup,

41:02.822 --> 41:05.291
boom, what do you got?
Chicken nuggets.

41:05.324 --> 41:09.161
Right? It's all the same. It all might
look a little bit different, right?

41:09.195 --> 41:12.398
But on the inside,
it's all the same.

41:12.431 --> 41:13.332
That is beautiful.

41:14.233 --> 41:15.668
Thank you, Jackie.

41:16.936 --> 41:20.773
Of course, I like to think that
the best part of the chicken

41:20.806 --> 41:22.041
is the white meat.

41:25.077 --> 41:27.746
- Ahh!
- Oh! There it is.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.982
Look at that.
Oriental chocolate cake.

41:30.015 --> 41:33.185
Pepe, <i>visto</i>, <i>no oído.</i>

41:35.254 --> 41:36.388
She just told him to sit down.

41:37.256 --> 41:38.324
And to be quiet.

41:39.191 --> 41:40.626
See?

41:42.461 --> 41:44.163
All right. Pass your plate, son.

41:45.264 --> 41:49.201
Um, so, what are the plans?

41:49.235 --> 41:51.036
Gonna be a funeral?

41:51.070 --> 41:53.038
Mom... she didn't want
a funeral.

41:54.273 --> 42:00.146
What? No funeral? I mean,
is a preacher at least gonna bury her?

42:00.179 --> 42:03.182
Mom didn't really care
for preachers either.

42:03.215 --> 42:05.718
Houston,
we have a problem.

42:05.751 --> 42:08.754
She just lived her life
in a certain way and felt that

42:08.787 --> 42:10.990
her death should be consistent
with that, that's all.

42:11.023 --> 42:13.192
I am not one to gossip,
but I have to say this

42:13.225 --> 42:17.396
because it's on my heart.
I feel you two are doomed

42:19.265 --> 42:22.034
- to go down the same path.
- We have ignition.

42:22.067 --> 42:25.471
- What path are you referring to exactly?
- Well, damnation.

42:25.504 --> 42:29.175
Damnation. And I don't
just mean spiritually.

42:29.208 --> 42:31.810
I mean life in general.
I've known

42:31.844 --> 42:34.880
you two had challenges
even as children.

42:34.914 --> 42:36.081
Challenges?

42:37.283 --> 42:41.153
Go for it. I'm just sitting here
eating my cake being cool.

42:41.187 --> 42:43.355
With all due respect,
Aunt Jackie,

42:43.389 --> 42:45.157
you don't even know Star and I.

42:45.191 --> 42:47.126
We haven't seen you
since we were kids.

42:47.159 --> 42:50.729
And if I'm not mistaken,
Mom left the house at what, 17?

42:50.763 --> 42:53.432
And she only got a hold of you a
handful of times over the years.

42:53.465 --> 42:55.868
- So, I don't believe...
- Yeah. That was really my choice

42:55.901 --> 42:58.804
because I did not need
to keep a relationship

42:58.837 --> 43:01.507
with a sister who couldn't
keep her legs closed.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.842
- Whoa, what?
- We have liftoff.

43:03.876 --> 43:05.744
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I think she just straight up

43:05.778 --> 43:07.146
- called Mom a slut.
- Okay.

43:07.179 --> 43:09.515
All right. Jackie, just...

43:09.548 --> 43:11.884
No. Let me talk. They're adults.

43:11.917 --> 43:14.920
Your mother was selfish
through and through,

43:14.954 --> 43:19.058
and her inability to give you
any guidance whatsoever

43:19.091 --> 43:23.062
is the reason that you are the way you are.

43:23.095 --> 43:25.898
Aunt Jackie, can I ask a question,
and you can tell me the truth.

43:25.931 --> 43:31.470
Um, was Uncle Randal not giving you
the hard and heavy like you like it?

43:31.503 --> 43:33.372
- Why...
- Excuse me?

43:33.405 --> 43:35.541
Because I'm sensing
someone had a shag

43:35.574 --> 43:37.876
with the gardener and was
just too afraid to admit it.

43:37.910 --> 43:40.346
- Star...
- All right. Now, we're not gonna have that talk.

43:40.379 --> 43:43.082
Come on. Pepe's not
from a foster program, right?

43:43.115 --> 43:47.486
I mean, you banged your way
to free child labor. I mean,

43:47.519 --> 43:51.257
- come on.
- Okay. I understand your need to inject

43:51.290 --> 43:54.026
levity
into an uncomfortable situation.

43:54.059 --> 43:57.863
Right. Like Pablo the pool man injected
his spicy bean burrito into you.

43:57.896 --> 43:59.498
- I mean, I'm just saying like it is.
- Star!

43:59.531 --> 44:01.900
Okay. That... that's it.
Pepe, come on.

44:01.934 --> 44:05.271
Okay. No. Bedtime.
Come on, sweetie.

44:05.304 --> 44:07.072
You're not funny.

44:08.007 --> 44:10.042
- No, you're not.
- Okay.

44:10.075 --> 44:12.144
<i>Buenos noches</i>, <i>señorita</i>.

44:12.177 --> 44:14.013
<i>Buenos noches</i>, Pepe.

44:14.046 --> 44:14.980
That's polite.

44:16.181 --> 44:19.051
You're not.
And I'm not a racist.

44:19.084 --> 44:21.987
I've got a brown boy
living in my house.

44:24.890 --> 44:29.228
Apparently you've mistaken
my active disciplined

44:30.129 --> 44:34.466
and present role in my child's
life as something it's not.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.970
But then again, I guess
you wouldn't know what

44:38.003 --> 44:40.839
a present role is,
would you, Star?

44:40.873 --> 44:42.608
- Meaning?
- How is your daughter?

44:42.642 --> 44:44.143
I haven't heard
you mention her at all.

44:45.544 --> 44:48.047
- I didn't say anything.
- No, you don't have to.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.249
You don't exactly scream
Mother of the Year Award.

44:52.151 --> 44:55.421
Yeah. We're done with cake time.

44:55.454 --> 44:58.624
There's extra blankets
on the guest bed.

44:58.658 --> 45:01.026
I'd like it if you were out
of here by breakfast.

45:01.593 --> 45:04.963
You might want to pull back
on throwing stones, Star.

45:05.564 --> 45:08.534
You're not gonna be able to see
your own house with all the cracks.

45:18.143 --> 45:19.478
That went well, huh?

45:44.136 --> 45:45.337
You just couldn't go
with it could you?

45:46.972 --> 45:50.309
- Go with what, Brandon?
- You know how Jackie and Randal are.

45:51.210 --> 45:55.013
It's like you can sense their aggravation
and you just went for the jugular.

45:55.047 --> 45:57.950
She deserved it. You heard
what she said about Mom.

45:57.983 --> 46:00.986
Oh. I feel like
I'm being slowly gassed

46:01.019 --> 46:02.554
by this low-hanging
cloud of hypocrisy.

46:02.588 --> 46:05.391
Wow, are we poetic at 2:00 a.m.

46:05.424 --> 46:06.558
You didn't even like Mom.

46:07.727 --> 46:09.629
I think the case could even be
made that you hated her.

46:11.563 --> 46:15.100
She said one thing and you
just jumped all over Jackie.

46:21.140 --> 46:23.008
You think I hated Mom?

46:23.041 --> 46:26.478
Well, yeah, didn't you?

46:31.583 --> 46:33.352
Love, like, hate,

46:34.754 --> 46:36.221
grow up, Brandon.

46:37.122 --> 46:39.057
They're all versions
of the same thing.

46:42.060 --> 46:45.330
Right. Yeah.

46:45.364 --> 46:47.533
Grow up. Me grow up.

47:22.401 --> 47:26.104
No. No. There's no way.

47:28.106 --> 47:29.709
No. No, there's no way.
No way. No how. I mean...

47:31.477 --> 47:34.313
I mean, I'm stressed and it's
in the middle of the night

47:34.346 --> 47:38.116
and I can't sleep
and no one's coming.

47:38.751 --> 47:42.054
Well, except me, obviously.

47:50.529 --> 47:53.499
Fuck it.

47:53.532 --> 47:54.634
Okay.

47:57.436 --> 48:02.341
Star, you've officially
gone past sick and twisted,

48:03.442 --> 48:05.310
but you're rounding the corner

48:05.344 --> 48:07.112
to full on perverse.

48:08.413 --> 48:10.717
Okay. Okay, Georgie.

48:12.584 --> 48:14.620
Oh, come on. Georgie!

48:17.456 --> 48:18.758
Sexy Cowboy!

48:18.791 --> 48:21.527
Oh, Georgie!

48:21.560 --> 48:23.362
What in the holy hell?

48:24.196 --> 48:28.467
I... thought... I thought you were an intruder.

48:29.535 --> 48:31.303
Unreal, Star.

48:32.237 --> 48:34.573
You are a sick girl.

48:34.606 --> 48:37.810
Why would you bring that kind
of behavior into our home?

48:37.844 --> 48:41.079
You're defiled
my George Bush corner.

48:42.614 --> 48:47.553
Well, it definitely gives your Channel 6
news story a run for its money, doesn't it?

48:48.220 --> 48:50.657
I want you out! Out!

48:53.525 --> 48:54.761
Pepe!

49:29.862 --> 49:30.863
You want some?

49:35.500 --> 49:37.369
What do you think
is in these things?

49:38.871 --> 49:42.240
Oh, the good ol' not talking
to Star game.

49:42.274 --> 49:43.375
Mature.

49:46.612 --> 49:47.714
Lips and assholes.

49:48.580 --> 49:49.514
Excuse me?

49:50.449 --> 49:51.851
Lips and assholes.
That's what's in them.

49:52.852 --> 49:55.420
How fitting.

49:55.454 --> 49:56.823
What do you mean
how fitting?

49:57.757 --> 50:00.827
It's a "Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles" quote, okay?

50:00.860 --> 50:03.763
And here we are on a road trip.
You see? Fitting.

50:03.796 --> 50:06.899
Ah, right genre.
John Hughes.

50:06.933 --> 50:09.368
Wrong movie.
"Great Outdoors," Ebert.

50:09.401 --> 50:11.536
You know, John Wayne

50:11.570 --> 50:14.573
said that you can never trust
a guy who doesn't drink

50:14.606 --> 50:16.676
or get his John Hughes
references correct.

50:16.709 --> 50:18.343
That's a fact.

50:22.514 --> 50:24.316
So, there's something
I have to tell you.

50:25.517 --> 50:27.619
- What?
- Well, it's not that easy to say,

50:27.654 --> 50:31.223
- so I just have to blurt it out.
- Oh, this ought to be good.

50:34.761 --> 50:36.495
I masturbate to George Bush.

50:37.830 --> 50:41.634
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I was there.
Front row, remember?

50:41.668 --> 50:43.568
No. I don't think you understand.
It's not the first time.

50:44.302 --> 50:45.805
- You've done this before?
- Yeah.

50:51.410 --> 50:54.579
- Just Junior Bush or Senior too?
- Brandon!

50:54.613 --> 50:57.315
- What?
- I'm sick, but I'm not that sick.

50:57.917 --> 51:00.987
Although... no W, he's the one.

51:01.020 --> 51:03.656
There you have it.
That is what I do.

51:03.690 --> 51:07.325
You've pulled a lot of shit
over the years, Star, but this

51:08.393 --> 51:11.964
- this is fucked.
- I evidently have sexual compulsion disorder.

51:11.998 --> 51:14.499
- Oh.
- I'm getting much better. I now have the tools

51:14.533 --> 51:17.637
to reflect any expressionary
relief back on myself.

51:17.670 --> 51:19.271
- Back on yourself.
- Yeah.

51:19.806 --> 51:21.506
- By masturbating.
- Yeah. A lot.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.842
- Right.
- Yeah, a whole lot.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.509
Gotcha. Okay.

51:24.543 --> 51:25.878
Thank you for that.
That's great.

51:28.580 --> 51:30.683
- What about you?
- What about me?

51:30.717 --> 51:33.251
When was the last time you,
you know?

51:33.820 --> 51:35.420
When was the last time I what?

51:36.388 --> 51:38.323
- What is that?
- Oh, my God, it's like

51:38.356 --> 51:40.325
pulling teeth with you.
When's the last time you...

51:40.358 --> 51:41.259
you know,

51:44.897 --> 51:47.399
- polished the bishop?
- I'm not talking about this

51:47.432 --> 51:49.635
- with you.
- What? Days? Weeks? Months? What?

51:49.669 --> 51:51.503
Not... not talking about
this with you.

51:51.536 --> 51:53.873
What? If you can't talk
to your sister, Brandon,

51:53.906 --> 51:55.641
- who can you tell?
- Anyone but my sister.

51:55.675 --> 51:56.809
Oh, my God.

52:03.015 --> 52:05.918
- Two.
- Two weeks?

52:05.952 --> 52:08.988
God. That's why
you're so pent up.

52:13.325 --> 52:16.763
Two months? You haven't
gotten off in two months?

52:16.796 --> 52:19.431
Two months? I would die.

52:20.465 --> 52:21.466
No, Star.

52:25.537 --> 52:28.306
Oh, my God. Brandon.

52:28.340 --> 52:29.508
What?

52:31.077 --> 52:35.380
Two years. So what?
Two years. It's no big deal.

52:35.982 --> 52:37.315
Not a big deal?

52:38.818 --> 52:40.920
- I mean, is everything in working order down there?
- Yes.

52:40.953 --> 52:43.421
Everything is in working order
down here, thank you very much.

52:46.591 --> 52:48.995
We're just not all
jackrabbits like you.

52:49.028 --> 52:51.496
But two years, Brandon?
I hate to tell you,

52:51.530 --> 52:54.667
but that's not normal for a guy.
That is not normal for a gay guy.

52:54.700 --> 52:59.038
Okay? I'm surprised you haven't gone into
Starbucks and gone completely postal.

52:59.071 --> 53:02.108
Maybe some people in this car have a little
bit more self worth than others, huh?

53:02.141 --> 53:04.977
- You ever thought about that?
- For someone who doesn't like a dick,

53:05.011 --> 53:09.447
see a dick, or want to play with a dick,
you've certainly got being one down pat.

53:09.481 --> 53:12.417
Yeah. Well, for someone who sees
them all the time apparently,

53:12.450 --> 53:14.386
you sure talk about them
a lot, you know that?

53:14.419 --> 53:16.923
I already admitted I have
issues. What is your excuse?

53:16.956 --> 53:20.592
Excuse? Sometimes the solution
of a problem

53:20.626 --> 53:23.361
is not obsessing
every second of the day

53:23.395 --> 53:26.498
on the obsession, okay?
You're not an animal, Star.

53:26.531 --> 53:28.500
Be evolved. Try it.
It's the latest rage.

53:28.533 --> 53:30.602
I liked you better when you
weren't judging my life.

53:30.636 --> 53:32.370
I liked you better when you
weren't prying into mine.

53:32.404 --> 53:33.572
- Fine!
- Fine!

53:33.605 --> 53:34.874
Oh, my God, Brandon!

53:34.907 --> 53:36.976
Oh, my God.

53:37.009 --> 53:38.778
Oh, my God. They're dead!

53:38.811 --> 53:40.847
I was distracted
by your bullshit.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.850
Why are you talking to me
about George... what are you...

53:43.883 --> 53:46.786
- Look how sad they look! What do we do?
- Put them down!

53:46.819 --> 53:48.420
You're touching them?
They've got rabies.

53:48.453 --> 53:49.722
Oh, my...

53:50.923 --> 53:52.624
oh, my God.

53:52.658 --> 53:53.993
I can't believe this.

53:56.996 --> 53:59.699
Oh, I can't. Oh, God.

54:01.100 --> 54:02.969
What do you want
to do with them?

54:03.002 --> 54:05.671
We can't leave them here.
You murdered their mother.

54:05.705 --> 54:08.674
Why was she crossing with her whole family?
That's so irresponsible.

54:08.708 --> 54:11.010
Don't they have instincts
for this kind of stuff?

54:11.043 --> 54:13.478
There she was
minding her own business,

54:13.511 --> 54:15.848
taking her little otter family
to her little otter home

54:15.882 --> 54:17.984
on their little otter river,
when bam!

54:18.617 --> 54:21.553
- Instant otter orphans.
- Yeah, alright. Okay, I get it.

54:22.088 --> 54:25.557
It breaks my heart too, but all right,
we gotta go. We don't have time for this.

54:25.590 --> 54:28.127
No! Some hawk will probably pick them
off like little popcorn shrimp. No.

54:28.995 --> 54:31.664
Just...
what do you want to do?

54:33.165 --> 54:36.636
No. No.

54:37.870 --> 54:38.905
No!

54:55.755 --> 54:57.823
- I don't think this is sanitary.
- What?

54:57.857 --> 55:00.626
Them!
They're diseased probably.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.528
- What do you mean "diseased"?
- Diseased, like...

55:05.164 --> 55:07.465
- bird flu.
- They're otters, Brandon.

55:07.499 --> 55:09.902
Not chickens.
How can otters have bird flu?

55:17.910 --> 55:20.578
- This is kinda funny.
- What's kinda funny?

55:21.080 --> 55:24.216
You being on hell-bent
on save the otters.

55:25.751 --> 55:29.255
- It's called humanity.
- No. That's not the reason it's funny.

55:29.288 --> 55:31.857
It's funny 'cause this is
precisely what Mom would do.

55:31.891 --> 55:34.760
This is like Mom down to a T.
She would absolutely do

55:34.794 --> 55:36.929
exactly the same thing,
and here you are...

55:38.030 --> 55:41.734
I guess the apple doesn't
fall off far from the tree after all.

55:46.872 --> 55:47.907
Yeah, what do I know?

55:49.308 --> 55:51.644
Just a stupid observation.

55:56.816 --> 55:57.817
Is that what I think it is?

55:58.651 --> 56:00.720
- We have to go there.
- Look at the time, okay?

56:00.753 --> 56:03.022
- We really want to keep going.
- Brandon, just live a little!

56:03.055 --> 56:06.624
For God's sake, crack the windows
for the babies and let's go.

56:06.659 --> 56:08.094
Plus it's picture time
again.

56:09.594 --> 56:10.495
Great.

56:26.946 --> 56:29.849
Star, really?
Can we just snap a picture

56:29.882 --> 56:32.018
and get back on the road?
Plus, we can't leave your...

56:32.752 --> 56:36.122
- rodents for too long.
- A, they're not rodents.

56:36.155 --> 56:38.157
Rodents aren't cute.
Anything that's cute

56:38.190 --> 56:40.026
instantly disqualifies itself
as a rodent.

56:40.059 --> 56:41.894
Hence why the jury
is still out on you.

56:41.927 --> 56:43.863
And B, you gotta give me
five minutes to ride

56:43.896 --> 56:46.098
the tilt-a-whirl, 'cause
little known fact, it's a law

56:46.132 --> 56:48.701
when you come to the fair you
have to ride the tilt-a-whirl.

56:48.734 --> 56:51.237
Oh, and you also have to get
fingered in the spooky house,

56:51.270 --> 56:52.905
but I'll you off the hook
on that one.

56:52.938 --> 56:54.673
Your levels
of inappropriateness,

56:54.707 --> 56:56.342
they never cease to amaze me.

56:56.375 --> 56:58.344
That's why you love me.
That's why you love me...

56:58.377 --> 57:00.146
- Oh, God.
- ...so much.

57:00.179 --> 57:02.081
I can't say God,
I'm religious.

57:02.114 --> 57:03.949
Can you hurry up?
It's like you're literally

57:03.983 --> 57:05.918
- dragging me backwards.
- Stop marching around.

57:05.951 --> 57:07.787
I feel like
your legs are so small.

57:07.820 --> 57:09.355
You've got such good muscle
tone in your legs

57:09.388 --> 57:11.057
that I feel
like you would walk faster.

57:11.090 --> 57:12.758
Just stop dragging me.

57:12.792 --> 57:14.060
- I'm not your child.
- Just stride.

57:14.093 --> 57:16.095
Try to use your leg force

57:16.128 --> 57:17.997
- and propel you forward.
- I like my walk, leave me alone.

57:19.165 --> 57:21.367
- Hey. Just stand right there.
- What? Why?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.335
- Just do it, okay?
- What do you want me to do?

57:23.369 --> 57:25.237
- Shrug like this.
- Why? I'm not...

57:25.271 --> 57:27.273
Just do it!
Be a good sport, please?

57:27.306 --> 57:30.608
Just shrug, and look over
and go "cheese!"

57:30.643 --> 57:31.609
- Why?
- Just do it!

57:32.745 --> 57:34.914
- Just go "cheese!" Go.
- Then we're going, okay?

57:34.947 --> 57:36.315
Be a good sport, Brandon!

57:37.650 --> 57:41.787
- Cheese!
- And, sent.

57:41.821 --> 57:44.790
- Wait. No. Did you not...
- Who wants a corndog? I'm buying.

57:44.824 --> 57:46.859
- Let me see that.
- Just come on!

57:46.892 --> 57:47.960
I don't want
a corndog.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.634
Ah.

57:57.670 --> 58:00.773
Hey! Hey there, little guy.

58:00.806 --> 58:02.141
Excuse me,
is this your child?

58:02.174 --> 58:03.275
- No?
- Okay. Thank you.

58:03.943 --> 58:05.111
- Helpful
- Are you lost?

58:06.145 --> 58:08.948
Where's your momma, huh?
You don't know?

58:10.816 --> 58:12.885
- What do you think?
- I don't know. I mean,

58:13.419 --> 58:17.089
this isn't like the otters. We can just
stick him in a cage and put him in the RV.

58:17.123 --> 58:19.692
It's gotta be against
some law somewhere.

58:19.725 --> 58:20.960
We can't just leave him,
Brandon.

58:20.993 --> 58:22.228
I know. I was joking, all right.

58:22.261 --> 58:23.762
You're right. Let me just, uh,

58:24.997 --> 58:27.867
I'll go find an office. Maybe they
can make an announcement or something.

58:27.900 --> 58:29.768
Will you stay here in case
the parents come back,

58:30.302 --> 58:31.403
- Star?
- Yeah.

58:31.437 --> 58:32.338
Okay.

58:36.008 --> 58:39.145
You want to get some corndogs
with me? Yeah?

58:39.178 --> 58:43.149
Okay. Why don't you come
with me. Let's go.

58:46.385 --> 58:47.953
This is gonna
be fun in here.

58:52.324 --> 58:54.793
Ahh!
Look at all those games!

58:54.827 --> 58:57.930
Do you see those?
And all the lights? Yeah?

58:57.963 --> 59:00.166
Okay. There's a corndog stand
over there,

59:00.199 --> 59:03.202
I'm gonna get you a few corndogs
and then I'll come back. Okay?

59:03.235 --> 59:05.237
Sit over here and
I'll back in two seconds.

59:05.271 --> 59:07.773
High five. Yay.

59:15.347 --> 59:17.149
Hey, what can I do you for?

59:17.183 --> 59:18.951
Can I get three corndogs,
please?

59:18.984 --> 59:20.953
You don't look familiar.
Are you from around here?

59:20.986 --> 59:22.254
Does it look like I am?

59:22.288 --> 59:23.422
I could show you around.

59:24.790 --> 59:27.359
I'm good, thanks.
How much do I owe you?

59:28.260 --> 59:30.963
Well, they could
be on the house.

59:31.864 --> 59:34.500
As enticing as it is

59:34.533 --> 59:36.869
to trade sexual favors
for processed meats

59:36.902 --> 59:38.871
and fried cornmeal on a stick,

59:38.904 --> 59:41.307
I think I'll pass.
I have to get back to...

59:49.281 --> 59:52.117
Uh... Excuse me, have you seen
a little boy here?

59:52.151 --> 59:53.719
- No.
- Shit.

59:54.453 --> 59:55.754
Shit.

59:57.957 --> 01:00:00.893
Double shit. Excuse me.
Have you seen a little boy?

01:00:00.926 --> 01:00:03.095
He's about four years old.
Triple shit.

01:00:03.128 --> 01:00:06.298
Okay, Star? Good news.
I found the office.

01:00:06.332 --> 01:00:09.969
They have a lost and found.
They said just bring him... where is he?

01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:12.137
- I lost him.
- Are you joking?

01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:16.175
Where? I turned my back
for a split second and...

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:17.509
- and he's gone.
- Damn it, Star.

01:00:18.277 --> 01:00:19.945
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:23.949
- This is what you always do.
- What do I always do?

01:00:23.983 --> 01:00:26.485
What do you always do.
You fuck everything up.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:30.889
Wait, what what are you...

01:00:32.191 --> 01:00:33.392
Star.

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:39.465
Star! Oh, God dammit.

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:26.011
- Hey. What you doing?
- Nothing.

01:01:31.216 --> 01:01:33.552
The parents
found the kid by the way.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.323
Someone took him back to the office,
and they were waiting for him, so...

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:42.394
- Thank God.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:44.430
Yeah.

01:01:46.999 --> 01:01:47.900
Are you mad?

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:49.401
No.

01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:53.939
You?

01:01:55.007 --> 01:01:56.342
No. I'm, uh...

01:01:59.011 --> 01:01:59.945
I'm sorry.

01:02:01.914 --> 01:02:03.549
You must think
I'm an awful person.

01:02:05.652 --> 01:02:07.219
- What?
- Come on, Brandon.

01:02:08.587 --> 01:02:10.589
You don't have to dance around it.
I mean, what kind of mother...

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:15.928
basically abandons her daughter?

01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:17.496
I mean,
who does that, right?

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:22.301
- Star, there's...
- I just need to hear it from you, Brandon.

01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:26.238
I need you to tell me

01:02:29.174 --> 01:02:33.045
what an awful person I am
and how screwed up I am.

01:02:33.078 --> 01:02:35.047
I need you to tell me that,
please.

01:02:36.315 --> 01:02:38.016
I'm not judging you, Star.

01:02:40.352 --> 01:02:44.556
I just think
that there's more to you.

01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:47.926
You could be so much more.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.629
- You could be...
- Be what, Brandon?

01:02:51.997 --> 01:02:52.998
You could be better.

01:02:59.304 --> 01:03:00.439
I want to tell you something.

01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:05.310
When Chelsea was young and I
was still living with Mitch,

01:03:05.344 --> 01:03:08.947
she got sick, okay?
She got really, really sick.

01:03:08.981 --> 01:03:11.684
Fever through the roof,
dripping with sweat,

01:03:11.718 --> 01:03:15.087
and I was home alone. Let me
tell you, I was overwhelmed.

01:03:15.554 --> 01:03:18.924
I didn't want to tell Mom, I thought she
would think that I did something wrong.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.262
And in some strange way,

01:03:24.229 --> 01:03:26.265
I thought
she was gonna die that night,

01:03:27.266 --> 01:03:31.069
that she was gonna die
right there in my arms.

01:03:32.471 --> 01:03:36.074
She was so beautiful,
and she was so sick.

01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:39.511
And I thought,
this is it, right?

01:03:39.545 --> 01:03:44.216
This is my fault.
God gave me this beautiful...

01:03:44.249 --> 01:03:46.251
this beautiful little girl

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.391
to take her away from me
and to teach me a lesson, right?

01:03:53.258 --> 01:03:55.294
Because that's what I do,
Brandon.

01:03:56.228 --> 01:03:59.465
It's what I do,
and it's who I am.

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:05.237
Who are you, Star?

01:04:06.438 --> 01:04:08.073
I'm broken, Brandon.

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:14.246
I hurt people,
and I let them down,

01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:15.614
and I know that.

01:04:16.683 --> 01:04:18.283
It's in my DNA.

01:04:19.318 --> 01:04:21.587
I am the way I am with Chelsea

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:25.524
because the only...

01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:31.163
chance she has in this life

01:04:31.196 --> 01:04:35.267
is for me as far away
from her as possible.

01:04:37.402 --> 01:04:39.071
She's just...

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:47.179
she's just better off
without me.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:52.584
That's not true.

01:04:56.823 --> 01:04:57.790
You know...

01:05:00.392 --> 01:05:03.763
you know one of the things that they
pounded into us at these retreats?

01:05:05.163 --> 01:05:07.399
Perfection, true perfection,

01:05:09.401 --> 01:05:11.270
is not when there's
nothing more to add.

01:05:13.272 --> 01:05:14.774
It's when there's nothing left
to take away.

01:05:17.476 --> 01:05:18.577
And that means?

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.181
Fuck if I know.

01:05:25.517 --> 01:05:27.854
And that's the bullshit you've
been learning for all these months?

01:05:27.887 --> 01:05:30.522
Like, that's it? That's, like,
what you get from that?

01:05:30.556 --> 01:05:33.726
Yeah. Yeah. That's what
I've been spending my money on.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.795
That's good, right?

01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:38.130
You should stop spending
your money.

01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:40.633
Oh...

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:42.568
yeah.

01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:45.805
It's gonna be okay.

01:06:50.602 --> 01:06:52.805
Well, it could be worse.

01:06:54.206 --> 01:06:56.408
Till we find a dead body
under the bed.

01:06:57.376 --> 01:07:00.312
Okay, guys, welcome
to your new home.

01:07:00.345 --> 01:07:02.782
We are one big happy family.

01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:06.853
"Family." It's gotta be one of the most
perverse words in the English language.

01:07:09.287 --> 01:07:12.424
- Do you actually feel that way?
- No, Star.

01:07:12.892 --> 01:07:15.928
It's just a quip
with our shtick, right?

01:07:15.962 --> 01:07:19.531
Our witty repartee.
Don't overthink it.

01:07:22.769 --> 01:07:26.405
- Oh, God, yeah.
- I feel sorry for you.

01:07:28.306 --> 01:07:32.611
- Excuse me?
- Not in a condescending holier-than-thou way, I just...

01:07:34.379 --> 01:07:36.181
every time
I look at you, Brandon,

01:07:37.784 --> 01:07:39.618
all I see is pain.

01:07:40.653 --> 01:07:43.622
- You see what? Pain?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:43.656 --> 01:07:45.825
- I'm fine, okay?
- Are you?

01:07:47.827 --> 01:07:49.829
Just because we had
a little moment earlier,

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:52.597
doesn't give you the right
to vivisect my brain, okay?

01:07:52.632 --> 01:07:54.533
Would you please stop
pretending to care so much?

01:07:54.566 --> 01:07:57.269
Well, I'm your older sister,

01:07:57.302 --> 01:07:58.971
and that is what we do.

01:07:59.706 --> 01:08:02.675
Yeah. Well,
don't strain yourself.

01:08:07.345 --> 01:08:09.381
You know what?
You're exactly like Mom.

01:08:09.414 --> 01:08:11.751
- It's not even funny.
- Excuse me?

01:08:11.784 --> 01:08:14.386
Just pretending to care
when you haven't given a shit

01:08:14.419 --> 01:08:16.321
about anyone
but yourself for years.

01:08:16.923 --> 01:08:19.524
- That's the truth.
- Our mother

01:08:19.558 --> 01:08:23.029
was more than likely
a manic bipolar paranoid

01:08:23.062 --> 01:08:25.665
schizophrenic, but thank you
for the compliment.

01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:30.335
I know this sounds
like jack shit,

01:08:31.002 --> 01:08:34.640
but families are complex,
Brandon. Okay?

01:08:34.674 --> 01:08:37.274
- Yeah.
- Just ask the Donner party.

01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:39.679
Some of them were family members,
and they ate each other, so...

01:08:40.645 --> 01:08:43.850
God. Everything is just
one big joke to you, isn't it?

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:48.353
I tell jokes. I try to laugh, because if I
didn't, I'd be crying all the effing time.

01:08:48.386 --> 01:08:50.890
All right. Well, I'm not
laughing anymore, Star.

01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:51.957
Where are you going?

01:08:52.959 --> 01:08:55.060
At the end of the day,
what's the difference?

01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:57.496
When this is over,
you're just gonna leave anyway.

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:58.765
What are you
talking about?

01:08:58.798 --> 01:09:00.633
I'm going for a drink.

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.868
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.902 --> 01:09:04.036
Shit.

01:09:34.901 --> 01:09:36.334
Is this seat taken?

01:09:36.803 --> 01:09:38.004
No.

01:09:42.707 --> 01:09:43.810
Mind if I...

01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:52.018
Bartender, can I get
one more, please?

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:53.719
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

01:10:02.962 --> 01:10:04.396
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:10:06.498 --> 01:10:07.566
Slow night, huh?

01:10:09.401 --> 01:10:11.971
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty dead.

01:10:13.973 --> 01:10:14.874
Yeah.

01:10:17.176 --> 01:10:19.344
Then again, that's pretty much
always how it is around here.

01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:25.651
I'm, uh, I'm J.T.,
by the way.

01:10:25.685 --> 01:10:26.618
J.T.?

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.890
J.T. Good to meet you, J.T.

01:10:34.492 --> 01:10:35.828
You're not from around here,
are you?

01:10:37.462 --> 01:10:38.496
How'd you guess?

01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:42.601
Well, the shorts helped.

01:10:52.044 --> 01:10:54.981
So, J.T.,

01:10:57.049 --> 01:10:58.416
what does that stand for?

01:11:01.586 --> 01:11:02.889
Jesus Todd.

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:04.824
What?

01:11:05.557 --> 01:11:07.927
- Jesus Todd?
- Jesus Todd.

01:11:08.728 --> 01:11:11.097
How do you end up with a name
like Jesus Todd?

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:13.165
First name's Todd,

01:11:13.199 --> 01:11:16.401
but I grew up in a houseful
of older brothers.

01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:20.840
So every time I screwed up,
even most of the time when I wasn't,

01:11:20.873 --> 01:11:23.175
everybody was always
yelling out, "Jesus, Todd."

01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:24.542
I guess it stuck.

01:11:27.479 --> 01:11:28.180
Rich.

01:11:28.848 --> 01:11:29.815
You're name's Rich?

01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:32.084
No. I'm, uh,

01:11:33.119 --> 01:11:35.755
I'm Brandon. Brandon.

01:11:35.788 --> 01:11:38.758
Well, okay,
Brandon Brandon.

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.825
What you drinking?

01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:43.729
A lot.

01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:49.501
- Well, here's to drinking a lot.
- All right.

01:11:49.534 --> 01:11:51.837
Cheers, Jesus Todd.

01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:58.077
<i>It's for being
the mother you want to be.</i>

01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:00.680
<i>You do so much to shape
your baby's future.</i>

01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:06.018
- <i>Well, me and mom, we are really...</i>
- This is ridiculous.

01:12:06.052 --> 01:12:08.120
<i>The baby would probably
prefer to remain with its mother,</i>

01:12:08.154 --> 01:12:09.889
<i>but she's never far away.</i>

01:12:09.922 --> 01:12:11.757
Oh, come on, Universe.

01:12:13.558 --> 01:12:15.695
What am I supposed to do
with my life?

01:12:18.097 --> 01:12:22.234
No whammies, no whammies,
no whammies, and stop.

01:12:22.268 --> 01:12:25.204
<i>It was as if our entire country
looked into a mirror</i>

01:12:25.237 --> 01:12:27.139
<i>and saw our better selves.</i>

01:12:28.606 --> 01:12:30.542
<i>We were reminded
that we are citizens</i>

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:32.544
<i>with obligations to each other,</i>

01:12:32.577 --> 01:12:35.781
<i>to our country, and to history,</i>

01:12:35.815 --> 01:12:36.949
<i>and the good we can do.</i>

01:12:37.917 --> 01:12:40.820
<i>For too long
our culture has said</i>

01:12:40.853 --> 01:12:42.188
<i>"if it feels good, do it."</i>

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:45.257
<i>Now America is embracing
a new ethic</i>

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:47.226
<i>and a new creed.</i>

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:19.692
<i>Hello?</i>

01:13:22.094 --> 01:13:25.031
<i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:30.970
- Hey, Mitch, it's me.
- <i>Star...</i>

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:33.139
<i>Christ.
Do you know what time it is?</i>

01:13:33.172 --> 01:13:34.940
I'm gonna fight for her, Mitch.

01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:37.676
I'm gonna fight for her.

01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:42.314
I'm not going anywhere.

01:13:45.251 --> 01:13:46.719
Not this time.

01:13:49.188 --> 01:13:51.023
I just wanted you to know, so...

01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:53.759
<i>That's great, Star.
You... you know,</i>

01:13:53.793 --> 01:13:55.828
<i>it's nice
of you to show up now</i>

01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:57.630
<i>all of sudden and say
you're gonna fight for her,</i>

01:13:57.663 --> 01:13:59.131
<i>but, what...</i>

01:14:23.923 --> 01:14:25.357
Easy, easy, easy!

01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:27.159
All right,
all right, all right.

01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:29.128
Hey! Not on the first date,
all right?

01:14:29.161 --> 01:14:31.630
- My sister said not to do anything...
- Uh...

01:14:31.664 --> 01:14:35.067
- well, she's a complete slut, so, whatever, but...
- Jesus Christ.

01:14:35.101 --> 01:14:39.839
Hey, be a gentleman, okay?

01:14:39.872 --> 01:14:41.240
- A gentleman?
- A gentleman.

01:14:41.273 --> 01:14:43.342
Good things come
to those who wait.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:44.977
- Oh, yeah.
- And if you wait long enough,

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.713
then you might come.

01:14:47.746 --> 01:14:48.848
Yeah.

01:14:52.785 --> 01:14:54.120
You're a comedian,
you know that?

01:15:04.697 --> 01:15:06.132
What the fuck...?

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.102
- Fuck are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

01:15:11.337 --> 01:15:14.406
- I'm looking for your tonsils.
- Hey, hey. I'm straight, okay?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.674
I'm not gay.

01:15:16.342 --> 01:15:18.010
- You're straight?
- Yeah.

01:15:18.043 --> 01:15:20.813
Yeah. And I'm the prince
of Siam.

01:15:20.846 --> 01:15:26.218
Or, uh, would that be,
uh, Princess?

01:15:28.354 --> 01:15:30.389
Get the fuck away from me,
you queer!

01:15:31.957 --> 01:15:34.026
- What the fuck is your problem?
- My problem?

01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:36.362
You're the faggot.

01:15:39.732 --> 01:15:40.432
Okay.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.935
Okay. I see what this is.

01:15:42.968 --> 01:15:45.137
You're, like, what...

01:15:46.105 --> 01:15:50.843
two, two-and-a-half years
from praying away the gay?

01:15:50.876 --> 01:15:53.212
Or do you think you're the first
one to go down that road?

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.017
'Cause you sure as shit ain't the
first city queer to wander out here.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.389
Fucking head case out
of towners.

01:16:05.157 --> 01:16:06.358
Fuck you say?

01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:10.462
Look, Mary.

01:16:11.497 --> 01:16:13.098
It ain't that complicated.

01:16:13.832 --> 01:16:16.869
See, this whole educate
the gay youth of America thing,

01:16:18.337 --> 01:16:20.072
it ain't my goddamn job.

01:16:20.105 --> 01:16:21.840
We're either here to fuck

01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:23.876
or we aren't.

01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:26.345
Yeah.

01:16:27.846 --> 01:16:28.914
That's what I thought.

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:33.185
Wait.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.487
What?

01:16:48.567 --> 01:16:49.468
What?

01:16:52.104 --> 01:16:55.507
- Oh!
- Fuck you!

01:16:58.043 --> 01:17:03.349
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fucking fag!

01:17:03.382 --> 01:17:06.852
Fuck you, you fucking fag!
Fuck!

01:17:13.025 --> 01:17:14.059
Fuck you!

01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:53.032
Fuck you.

01:17:53.966 --> 01:17:55.167
Fuck you!

01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:11.310
Oh, my God!

01:19:11.343 --> 01:19:14.580
- Huh?
- Brandon? Hey.

01:19:17.349 --> 01:19:19.218
Go back to sleep, Star.

01:19:19.686 --> 01:19:20.586
Please.

01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:23.589
Oh, my God, Brandon.

01:19:24.423 --> 01:19:26.659
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:29.027
Just... just go back to sleep.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.632
Did someone hurt you?

01:19:35.968 --> 01:19:37.236
Oh, my God.

01:19:40.572 --> 01:19:42.174
I hurt somebody.

01:19:46.646 --> 01:19:48.147
I hurt somebody.

01:19:56.355 --> 01:20:00.125
Hey, hey, you're okay.

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:02.494
You're okay. Hey, you're safe.

01:20:02.528 --> 01:20:09.168
You're okay. You're okay.
Hey, you're okay.

01:20:09.702 --> 01:20:12.971
Hey, hey. Shh.

01:20:16.508 --> 01:20:17.710
You're okay.

01:20:27.787 --> 01:20:30.690
Hi, babies. There you go.

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:34.026
They're so cute.

01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:44.470
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:47.139 --> 01:20:48.240
You wanna talk?

01:20:49.508 --> 01:20:50.509
Not really.

01:20:51.644 --> 01:20:53.278
How do you feel?

01:20:54.647 --> 01:20:57.316
Like a truck ran over my brain
and put it back inside.

01:20:58.317 --> 01:20:59.551
And the other guy, is he...

01:21:01.487 --> 01:21:04.323
I have a hazy memory
of him running away,

01:21:04.356 --> 01:21:06.291
so I'm sure he's fine.

01:21:11.831 --> 01:21:12.998
Brandon?

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:16.401
Yes, Star?

01:21:21.774 --> 01:21:22.675
Nothing.

01:21:28.514 --> 01:21:29.481
I'm here.

01:21:31.784 --> 01:21:34.086
I know. I can see you.

01:21:35.087 --> 01:21:38.023
No. I'm not here. I'm...

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:40.727
I'm here.

01:21:42.427 --> 01:21:44.229
I'm not going anywhere,

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:45.732
and, um,

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.402
I just thought you should know.

01:22:02.214 --> 01:22:04.416
The other day you asked me
what my take is.

01:22:05.617 --> 01:22:06.686
- Remember?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.623
Well, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently.

01:22:11.658 --> 01:22:12.825
I've been trying
to figure it out.

01:22:14.226 --> 01:22:16.261
Trying to figure out
a lot of stuff.

01:22:23.703 --> 01:22:25.672
I've always
had this image in my head

01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:29.408
of me sitting
on the edge of a pool,

01:22:29.441 --> 01:22:30.576
kind of like this.

01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:34.513
My feet
are in the water, and

01:22:35.614 --> 01:22:37.382
I could feel
the bottom with my toes.

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:40.419
And as long as I can feel
the bottom, I'm good.

01:22:40.452 --> 01:22:41.219
I'll be fine.

01:22:44.824 --> 01:22:47.459
But recently,
the past few months,

01:22:50.329 --> 01:22:51.864
it scares me 'cause I...

01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:55.300
I can't feel it anymore.

01:22:56.401 --> 01:22:58.337
It just goes on forever
and ever, you know?

01:23:00.707 --> 01:23:02.842
Probably
doesn't make much sense.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:05.477
It actually makes
a lot of sense.

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.890
I'm lost, Star.

01:23:19.692 --> 01:23:20.727
I'm really lost.

01:23:22.494 --> 01:23:23.663
Bad lost.

01:23:26.498 --> 01:23:29.201
Everything
is slipping away from me,

01:23:30.202 --> 01:23:31.671
and it scares
the fuck out of me.

01:23:34.373 --> 01:23:36.508
Does it sound like a heap
of shit to say that

01:23:37.844 --> 01:23:40.612
I don't really have
the answers, Brandon,

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.915
but I do love you.

01:23:45.952 --> 01:23:47.185
Truthfully?

01:23:48.387 --> 01:23:49.454
Yeah.

01:23:50.589 --> 01:23:53.158
- From you it does.
- You're so mean.

01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:57.596
Okay. Well, you must be hungry,
because I hear

01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:00.265
a night of gay bashing can
really work up an appetite so...

01:24:02.267 --> 01:24:03.936
There's a Quick Stop around the corner.
Do you want anything?

01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:06.405
Yeah,
I'll meet you over there.

01:24:06.438 --> 01:24:07.907
We gotta get going
soon though, okay?

01:24:11.476 --> 01:24:12.411
Star?

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:17.616
Yeah?

01:24:18.951 --> 01:24:19.852
Thank you.

01:24:22.387 --> 01:24:23.388
No problem.

01:24:43.843 --> 01:24:45.544
Pick your poison.

01:24:46.278 --> 01:24:48.881
Fortified with essential
glutamates and preservatives

01:24:48.915 --> 01:24:52.217
or little fried ringlets
of the mystery meat.

01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:55.620
Hey.

01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:03.495
Uh, nice eyes?

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:05.564
It's an exercise, right?

01:25:05.597 --> 01:25:07.466
In what... Geisha?

01:25:08.067 --> 01:25:10.803
In the program, they teach us
to implement one component

01:25:10.837 --> 01:25:13.840
of our new lives
as an expression of our manhood.

01:25:13.873 --> 01:25:16.475
So, I thought
I'd do the opposite.

01:25:18.477 --> 01:25:19.812
No? What do you think?

01:25:19.846 --> 01:25:20.747
Brandon,

01:25:21.781 --> 01:25:23.548
just because you decided
to poke your head out

01:25:23.582 --> 01:25:25.484
of your closet a little bit,
doesn't mean the guy

01:25:25.517 --> 01:25:28.020
that pops out
has to be Boy George.

01:25:29.655 --> 01:25:33.059
Boy George? Oh, my God.

01:25:33.092 --> 01:25:35.194
This looks ridiculous.
Where's... is this just water?

01:25:39.065 --> 01:25:40.298
It's not coming off.

01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:44.771
- How do you get this stuff off?
- Not so fast, Jack Sparrow.

01:25:44.804 --> 01:25:46.605
It just looks crazy.

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:52.310
You're a good woman, Star.

01:25:53.746 --> 01:25:55.447
You're a good woman too,
Brandon.

01:25:56.682 --> 01:25:57.616
Asshole.

01:26:03.622 --> 01:26:08.060
Holy tingling moose cock.

01:26:09.528 --> 01:26:11.463
Either it's real
or a bad batch of acid

01:26:11.496 --> 01:26:13.666
from the ninth grade
has leaked into my spinal cord,

01:26:13.699 --> 01:26:15.968
hitched a ride on an aneurysm
and leaked into my brain.

01:26:19.371 --> 01:26:21.339
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Star, Star,
we don't have much time here.

01:26:21.373 --> 01:26:23.042
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know,

01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:25.610
but I feel like
I'm the Millennium Falcon

01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:26.813
on the Death Star's
tractor beam.

01:26:26.846 --> 01:26:27.780
I can't help myself.

01:26:31.017 --> 01:26:32.517
Nice star.

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:36.354
You know my name?

01:26:37.723 --> 01:26:39.759
Guys, bring
it down a notch. Come on.

01:26:39.792 --> 01:26:41.894
Lady's allowed to get some
Skittles if she wants to.

01:26:41.928 --> 01:26:43.629
It is a free country.

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:46.666
Yesterday these meatheads
almost took out an entire group

01:26:46.699 --> 01:26:49.969
of church seniors whose bus
passed me by while I was jogging.

01:26:50.002 --> 01:26:52.772
I told them,
"Hey, guys, guys,

01:26:52.805 --> 01:26:57.043
only shoot the ones that don't have
their RNC cards on 'em."

01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:00.112
That was a joke.

01:27:01.681 --> 01:27:03.716
Whew. You're a tough crowd.

01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:09.722
I just want you to know that
the door is closed between us.

01:27:10.622 --> 01:27:12.457
- Excuse me, missy?
- The door,

01:27:13.159 --> 01:27:16.394
it's closed between us.

01:27:18.064 --> 01:27:20.365
It's over. Okay?

01:27:21.566 --> 01:27:23.368
Well, alrighty then.

01:27:26.538 --> 01:27:27.974
Thanks, Sam. I'll see you around

01:27:28.007 --> 01:27:30.676
- Sam?
- See you, Mr. President?

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:31.744
Mr. President.

01:27:35.081 --> 01:27:36.581
Okay.

01:27:37.984 --> 01:27:39.118
Well?

01:27:40.987 --> 01:27:42.688
Was it everything
you hoped it'd be?

01:27:42.722 --> 01:27:45.390
Yeah. I think it was.

01:27:48.661 --> 01:27:51.529
- Thanks.
- Could I help you two with anything?

01:27:51.563 --> 01:27:55.600
I think my sister just
broke it off with George W.,

01:27:55.635 --> 01:27:57.970
so we're good, sir.
You have a good day, okay?

01:27:58.004 --> 01:27:59.504
- Bye!
- Come on, come on.

01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:45.217
Let's go.

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:49.789
Holy shit, Star. We have less
than 30 minutes to do this.

01:28:49.822 --> 01:28:52.658
What's the plan? Pretty sure
you can't just walk up there

01:28:52.692 --> 01:28:54.860
and throw something
inside the whale's mouth.

01:28:54.894 --> 01:28:57.163
- What about your otters?
- Oh, good point. Keys.

01:28:57.196 --> 01:29:01.067
They're a family, and family
needs air conditioning. Okay.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:03.069
We're not taking the otters.

01:29:03.102 --> 01:29:05.204
Plus I've learned from
experience that a fast getaway

01:29:05.237 --> 01:29:07.206
is needed,
so it's good to, you know,

01:29:07.239 --> 01:29:08.774
- leave the car running.
- Good to know.

01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:11.143
Hurry up!

01:29:12.912 --> 01:29:15.247
- Okay. Where is it?
- I don't know.

01:29:16.215 --> 01:29:17.817
We'll just keep looking.

01:29:19.685 --> 01:29:21.687
- I can't see anything, Brandon.
- You're right. It's all right.

01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:24.924
- Gotta be in here somewhere.
- Brandon, there it is.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.296
- Oh, my...
- Wow.

01:29:30.329 --> 01:29:32.698
Okay. Okay. All right.

01:29:32.732 --> 01:29:35.868
Uh, what... what do we do?

01:29:35.901 --> 01:29:38.004
So now, if you follow me,

01:29:38.037 --> 01:29:39.872
we've got a special treat
for you.

01:29:39.905 --> 01:29:43.743
It's the behind-the-scenes tour
with our star,

01:29:43.776 --> 01:29:46.679
- Sasha the whale!
- Brandon...

01:29:46.712 --> 01:29:49.581
You'll get to see
an intimate feeding session

01:29:49.614 --> 01:29:52.118
- Shh.
- It's gonna be Christmas and Halloween

01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:54.787
all in one. Right this way.

01:29:56.088 --> 01:29:57.957
- Let's go, alright?
- Alright.

01:30:10.302 --> 01:30:12.838
Here at the Roderick
Texas Aquarium,

01:30:12.872 --> 01:30:16.075
we're not only famous
for our over 3,000

01:30:16.108 --> 01:30:18.711
different aquatic species,
but also

01:30:18.744 --> 01:30:22.248
for our most famous resident,
Sasha the whale.

01:30:26.152 --> 01:30:29.955
- There she is.
- Behind this reinforced corrugated steel tank

01:30:29.989 --> 01:30:33.926
is 360 metric tons of ionized,

01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:36.062
purified salt water.

01:30:36.095 --> 01:30:39.965
We've recreated an orca's
natural environment

01:30:39.999 --> 01:30:43.102
to give her the utmost comfort
here at the park.

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:47.840
Sasha's an orca, or according to
her scientific classification,

01:30:47.873 --> 01:30:52.144
an orcinus orca.
She's an adolescent female

01:30:52.178 --> 01:30:56.682
and weights three-and-a-half
tons. That's heavy.

01:30:57.349 --> 01:30:59.985
If this works
and we don't get arrested,

01:31:00.019 --> 01:31:02.321
I will walk through downtown
Des Moines butt naked.

01:31:06.659 --> 01:31:08.828
Don't worry.
She can't get out of there.

01:31:08.861 --> 01:31:10.863
She's harmless anyway.

01:31:10.896 --> 01:31:12.631
Jesus Christ.

01:31:13.666 --> 01:31:16.402
- Okay, Sherlock. What's the plan here?
- Um...

01:31:16.435 --> 01:31:19.604
How exactly are we gonna get that thing
to swallow Mom's ashes? Seriously.

01:31:22.775 --> 01:31:24.877
Okay. We need a fish.
That's what we need.

01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:26.779
- Are you crazy?
- Why?

01:31:26.812 --> 01:31:28.380
I have seen this movie.
It ends up with my arm

01:31:28.414 --> 01:31:30.316
being chomped off
by a killer whale

01:31:30.349 --> 01:31:33.686
while the whole thing
is streamed on YouTube

01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:36.288
by that little girl over there.
We have a friend.

01:31:36.322 --> 01:31:39.358
- Seriously, we need a plan.
- We have exactly seven minutes to do this,

01:31:39.391 --> 01:31:42.695
shoot a picture over to Ira or all
of this was for not. Seriously.

01:31:42.728 --> 01:31:44.797
Come on. Look how far
we've come. Please.

01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:46.298
This isn't the real Sasha.

01:31:47.032 --> 01:31:49.902
- Huh?
- The real Sasha passed away.

01:31:49.935 --> 01:31:53.205
- This is Sasha number two.
- Good to know.

01:31:53.239 --> 01:31:56.876
Okay. And that wraps up our
special behind-the-scenes tour.

01:31:56.909 --> 01:31:59.445
Everyone here
at the Roderick Texas Aquarium

01:31:59.478 --> 01:32:01.780
hopes you had a whale of a day.

01:32:01.814 --> 01:32:04.717
Well, everyone follow me.

01:32:05.284 --> 01:32:06.252
Open it.

01:32:08.187 --> 01:32:09.855
- Open it.
- I think you should do it, okay?

01:32:09.889 --> 01:32:11.957
No. No.
You're the man, open it.

01:32:11.991 --> 01:32:13.926
I'm a bitter, confused
potential atheist.

01:32:13.959 --> 01:32:15.394
Gender does not come
into play here.

01:32:15.427 --> 01:32:17.429
- You do it.
- Brandon! I'll do it.

01:32:18.397 --> 01:32:19.398
Careful. Careful.

01:32:22.034 --> 01:32:23.169
Hey, Mom.

01:32:24.069 --> 01:32:25.971
- This is it?
- Yeah, that's Mom.

01:32:26.005 --> 01:32:28.007
What do...
where's the rest of her?

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.009
What do you mean "rest of her?"
Without being graphic,

01:32:30.042 --> 01:32:32.211
this is what happens when
they incinerate your whole body.

01:32:32.244 --> 01:32:33.412
That's what's left.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.748
Brandon.

01:32:36.982 --> 01:32:39.418
- What? What's wrong with it?
- She was always so there, right?

01:32:39.451 --> 01:32:43.088
Isn't this crazy? I mean, her whole
life reduced to this. It's just...

01:32:45.424 --> 01:32:48.994
- It's so simple.
- That's life.

01:32:51.997 --> 01:32:55.467
- I know it's crazy, but...
- What are you doing with that?

01:32:55.501 --> 01:33:01.273
Um, we're just, uh, you know, wanting to spend
an extra few minutes with Sasha is all.

01:33:01.307 --> 01:33:05.444
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We're, uh, we're friends with her.

01:33:07.813 --> 01:33:11.917
Yeah. Yeah. We just, uh,
want to give her a snack and,

01:33:11.951 --> 01:33:15.020
you know, say our goodbyes.
So why don't you run off to your parents

01:33:15.054 --> 01:33:17.423
and... and we'll do
just that, okay? Okay.

01:33:17.456 --> 01:33:20.392
- Snack?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:20.426 --> 01:33:23.128
A snack because, um, we...

01:33:23.929 --> 01:33:25.297
- are friends with her.
- Friends with her.

01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:27.433
Yeah. Okay. Listen.

01:33:28.234 --> 01:33:30.035
- Get that fish from there.
- I can't...

01:33:30.069 --> 01:33:31.804
- Shove the packet in its mouth...
- I can't do the...

01:33:31.837 --> 01:33:33.305
And throw the thing
over to Sasha.

01:33:33.339 --> 01:33:35.107
I can't do the raw fish.
I have a thing.

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.376
- What do you mean?
- I gag with raw fish.

01:33:37.409 --> 01:33:39.945
- I can't go anywhere near a raw fish.
- Brandon, Brandon,

01:33:39.979 --> 01:33:41.513
you're gay, okay?
Gays love sushi.

01:33:41.547 --> 01:33:43.515
It's a new genetic code.
You'll be fine.

01:33:43.549 --> 01:33:45.317
As long as we don't
bring too much attention

01:33:45.351 --> 01:33:46.885
to ourselves,
everything's gonna be fine...

01:33:50.055 --> 01:33:52.324
- They're playing with Sasha.
- kay. Brandon the jig is up.

01:33:52.358 --> 01:33:54.360
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Okay, okay.

01:33:54.393 --> 01:33:56.996
Brandon get the biggest fish,
the biggest fish!

01:33:57.029 --> 01:33:59.331
Get the biggest one
and come over.

01:33:59.365 --> 01:34:01.166
Now, shove the packet
in its mouth.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.035
- Shove it in its mouth.
- Oh, my God.

01:34:03.068 --> 01:34:05.170
- oh, my God.
- I can't do it.

01:34:05.204 --> 01:34:07.573
It's not gonna fit inside
his mouth, Star.

01:34:07.606 --> 01:34:09.308
You're gonna have to rip it
open and hand stuff it.

01:34:09.341 --> 01:34:11.377
- So rip the bag open.
- Okay. Hang on.

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:13.912
- Rip it open, rip it open.
- Just give me one second.

01:34:13.946 --> 01:34:15.848
- Okay, okay. Just try. Just try.
- I got this.

01:34:15.881 --> 01:34:18.083
- Just give it to me. Okay.
- Let me tear it. Hang on.

01:34:18.117 --> 01:34:20.119
Okay. Just hurry up!
Give it to me!

01:34:20.152 --> 01:34:22.288
- Let go of it for two seconds!
- No! You let go, Brandon.

01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:23.322
Oh!

01:34:27.493 --> 01:34:28.494
I, uh...

01:34:31.063 --> 01:34:34.033
- what do we do?
- I don't know. Try and put her back.

01:34:36.201 --> 01:34:40.372
I'm sorry, Mom. Oh, God.

01:34:52.584 --> 01:34:54.053
"Dear Poochies,

01:34:56.255 --> 01:34:59.258
wow, you really did it. I was
just fucking with you."

01:34:59.291 --> 01:35:00.159
Oh, God.

01:35:01.493 --> 01:35:04.263
"Who wants to be swallowed
by a whale anyway?

01:35:05.632 --> 01:35:07.232
Hope this brought you together.

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:11.570
That was my real last wish.
Love, Mom."

01:35:14.641 --> 01:35:19.244
- Well...
- Well, what do you want to do now?

01:35:19.978 --> 01:35:21.280
I don't know.

01:35:22.081 --> 01:35:22.981
Thanks, Mom.

01:35:23.615 --> 01:35:25.351
Thanks, Mom!

01:35:25.384 --> 01:35:27.052
Hey! You guys,
what are you doing?

01:35:27.086 --> 01:35:28.320
Run. Run.

01:35:28.354 --> 01:35:30.089
- What?
- Wait, wait.

01:35:30.122 --> 01:35:31.990
Let's get a picture, come on!

01:35:32.024 --> 01:35:33.492
Cheese!

01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:35.594
Okay. Run! Go!

01:35:39.632 --> 01:35:41.400
Go, go, go, go!

01:35:42.968 --> 01:35:46.071
I think we lost them! Go B!
The other way!

01:35:46.105 --> 01:35:48.607
- Go! Hurry up, hurry up!
- Get in, get in, get in, get in.

01:35:49.375 --> 01:35:51.944
Oh, God, oh, God. Check
the otters, check the otters!

01:35:51.977 --> 01:35:54.079
Okay, they're good.

01:35:54.113 --> 01:35:55.447
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:55.481 --> 01:35:57.282
- Here we go.
- One second.

01:35:57.316 --> 01:35:59.451
- We have to. One second.
- What? Star!

01:35:59.485 --> 01:36:02.254
Just one second, Brandon!
I have to! One second.

01:36:02.287 --> 01:36:04.490
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

01:36:04.523 --> 01:36:06.158
We don't have time for this.

01:36:10.329 --> 01:36:12.030
Come oh, hurry up,
they're coming!

01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:15.901
Come on! Okay,
okay, okay, okay.

01:36:16.636 --> 01:36:18.103
- Okay.
- Get in, get in, get in!

01:36:18.137 --> 01:36:19.438
For Mom. Go!

01:36:19.471 --> 01:36:21.306
- Go, go, go!
- There they are!

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:23.542
Go! Whoo!

01:36:25.678 --> 01:36:27.179
We love you, Mom!

01:36:30.683 --> 01:36:33.986
You're crazy, Star.
You are crazy.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:39.425
- Go, go, go!
- Goodbye!

01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:41.293
- Ah-ooo!
- Whoo!

01:36:41.326 --> 01:36:44.697
Oo-oo-ooh! Oh, shit,
this is a one way.

01:36:44.731 --> 01:36:47.065
This is a one way.
We're good. We're good.

01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:52.297
Alright.

01:37:54.533 --> 01:37:56.134
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

01:38:07.747 --> 01:38:08.781
Alright.

01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:13.485
Now, the map said it's
a protected landmark area, so

01:38:14.152 --> 01:38:16.221
- it should be nice.
- Hurry up!

01:38:16.255 --> 01:38:18.190
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

01:38:19.124 --> 01:38:21.460
Uh, Brandon?

01:38:22.561 --> 01:38:24.631
Whoa, what is that?

01:38:25.665 --> 01:38:27.634
- Is that...
- A sign.

01:38:28.701 --> 01:38:31.638
- Come on. Come on!
- All right.

01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:33.138
Let's do it!

01:38:36.241 --> 01:38:38.410
Right here. Okay.
Let's say a prayer.

01:38:38.443 --> 01:38:39.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:38:41.613 --> 01:38:42.649
Dear Heavenly Father,

01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:46.351
thank you for this beautiful
and very relevant

01:38:46.385 --> 01:38:48.186
setting for our friends here.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:49.288
Family, come on.

01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:50.455
Family.

01:38:51.623 --> 01:38:53.726
Please watch over them
and guide them

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.394
for the rest
of their little lives.

01:38:55.427 --> 01:38:57.162
- Amen.
- A-woman.

01:38:59.632 --> 01:39:03.335
Okay. Hey, guys, listen up.

01:39:03.368 --> 01:39:04.804
This the real world, okay?

01:39:04.837 --> 01:39:06.538
This ain't gonna be easy.

01:39:06.572 --> 01:39:08.808
There are storms
and hunters and alligators

01:39:08.841 --> 01:39:11.577
that are gonna eat you.
But my advice.

01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:13.579
You stick together,
you're family,

01:39:13.612 --> 01:39:15.280
and you'll be just fine.

01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:17.850
Okay. Let's do this.
On three?

01:39:17.884 --> 01:39:19.451
On three.

01:39:19.484 --> 01:39:22.487
One, two, three. Whoo!

01:39:24.289 --> 01:39:25.892
- Whoo!
- Freedom!

01:39:25.925 --> 01:39:27.259
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:29.328
Freedom!

01:39:30.495 --> 01:39:33.599
Bye! Go!

01:39:34.734 --> 01:39:36.401
- Be free!
- Freedom!

01:39:36.435 --> 01:39:37.603
Whoo!

01:39:40.572 --> 01:39:42.374
- Wow.
- They're so cute.

01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:45.310
Good job, Star.

01:39:47.412 --> 01:39:50.750
Home sweet home.
Look at them go.

01:40:00.893 --> 01:40:01.894
What do you think?

01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:05.632
I think they're gonna be okay.

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.402
- And us?
- Us?

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.672
Us.

01:40:14.206 --> 01:40:15.574
We're pretty much fucked.

01:40:54.513 --> 01:40:56.281
Where the hell are we?

01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:03.823
Go
over there and park over there,

01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:07.026
and we'll make sure that
we go and take our picture.

01:41:10.897 --> 01:41:12.531
- You love taking pictures.
- Ah!

01:41:12.564 --> 01:41:14.232
You're so good
at taking pictures.

01:41:14.266 --> 01:41:15.802
- All right.
- It's very good.

01:41:15.835 --> 01:41:17.770
You're very distracting,
okay? Let me drive.

01:41:17.804 --> 01:41:19.504
- Very distracting.
- Yes, we can go. Let me drive.

01:41:21.473 --> 01:41:24.376
You know, sometimes I think
Adele speaks like this.

01:41:24.844 --> 01:41:26.545
This is a very good
Adele accent.

01:41:26.578 --> 01:41:28.748
Can you do an Adele accent

01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:30.950
or an Aussie accent, mate?
Good day, Mate,

01:41:30.983 --> 01:41:33.886
how's it going? Have a beer
and a shrimp on the barby.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.755
Was an African
over there, brother?

01:41:35.788 --> 01:41:37.690
What's your favorite accident?

01:41:38.457 --> 01:41:41.761
- They're all terrible.
- How about you do an English accent?

01:41:41.794 --> 01:41:43.328
Hello, Puppet,

01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:44.731
I'm your governor.

01:41:44.764 --> 01:41:46.331
That is terrible.

01:41:46.364 --> 01:41:48.500
Can I have a cup
of tea and scones?

01:41:48.935 --> 01:41:51.738
- Right?
- You are like the worst...

01:41:51.771 --> 01:41:54.741
you should never do
an English accent.

01:41:54.774 --> 01:41:57.609
- That was good.
- No. You should never do an English accent.

01:41:57.643 --> 01:41:59.478
- I know I'm good.
- Your English accent is like...

01:41:59.511 --> 01:42:01.914
- Listen again.
- Hello, puppet.

01:42:01.948 --> 01:42:04.382
Care to have
a cup of tea, Governor?

01:42:04.416 --> 01:42:06.284
- That's perfect.
- Oh, my God, Governor,

01:42:06.318 --> 01:42:07.787
- my name's Adele.
- That's perfect.

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:09.956
- My name's Adele.
- Who's Adele?

01:42:10.857 --> 01:42:12.725
She's... I don't know.

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:15.560
I'm just fucking with you.
I know who Adele is.

01:42:16.394 --> 01:42:18.631
Good day, mate.

01:42:19.065 --> 01:42:20.599
That's a good
Australian accent.

01:42:20.633 --> 01:42:22.034
Cheers, mate.
