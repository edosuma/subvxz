WEBVTT

01:35.200 --> 01:38.280
Once when I was a kid
I raced my cousin Pee Wee

01:38.280 --> 01:39.920
  eating Silver Dollar pancakes.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.960
Yeah? Who won?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.520
  Me. 25 pancakes in 11 minutes.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.280
     My aunt paid the cheque.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.440
       Barfed in her purse!

01:48.440 --> 01:52.240
Vomited so hard, I nearly gave myself
a Mallory-Weiss tear in the
oesophagus.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.040
Stay on your diet, Elliot.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.320
You and Marcie will be better off.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.760
Not to mention your aunt.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.120
Marcie said lovers should balance
their aesthetic qualities,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.640
part of the psycho-sexual
equality play.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.560
I'm not sure I know
what that really means!

02:06.560 --> 02:09.000
Does it have something
to do with who's on top?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.800
Axelrod, this is the monthly meeting
of department heads, not fatheads.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.280
Scram.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.440
Shall we get started?

02:17.440 --> 02:20.080
Daniel, I want to visit
my granddaughter in the nursery

02:20.080 --> 02:23.040
before rounds. Would
you try to keep it short, please?

02:23.040 --> 02:25.880
I'm trying to score a three-day
weekend, so I'd appreciate it.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.320
        You look terrible.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.120
Yeah, I feel like I'm
coming down with flu.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.720
You're infecting us all,
for Pete's sake.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.240
Donald, would you like
      to tell everyone

02:32.240 --> 02:34.400
about your
community-outreach programmes?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.680
When I was in Africa, I learned

02:36.680 --> 02:39.880
a great deal about medicine's
responsibility to the community.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.680
 Oh, I'm glad you brought this up.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.840
Ray Mildrum in Ophthalmology tells me

02:43.840 --> 02:47.840
we're having a yard sale
of one of our argon lasers.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.560
Do you know how many Zellman
Foundation rubber-chicken dinners

02:51.560 --> 02:55.560
I had to go through
to get that piece of hardware?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.440
Daniel and I feel that the laser

02:57.440 --> 02:59.360
is expendable, Mark,
and the money that we get

02:59.360 --> 03:02.080
from selling it will go towards
funding the outreach programme.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.920
               May I remind you both,

03:03.920 --> 03:07.920
it's surgery that generates the
largest revenues for St Eligius.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.440
Would you like to take a
vote on selling the thing?

03:10.440 --> 03:14.440
  Don't bother. The ayes have it.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.120
I don't feel well, I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.280
   He takes all this personally.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.160
      Keep it moving, Daniel.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.720
Any discharge or pain
during urination?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.480
Only blood. I did the WC Johnson
a lot the last couple of days.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.840
 Do you have insurance, Mr Bevine?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.120
Wouldn't be without it.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.120
My dad says roughly 45 million
Americans don't have health cover.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.520
That's a shame. Cos even though
the rate of inflation dropped from

03:42.520 --> 03:45.800
double digits in '82, hospital
costs rose 15% that same year.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.080
Another 12% in '83 and 10% in '84.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.720
    No stats yet for this year?

03:51.720 --> 03:53.320
Helen, you're going to miss the ER.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.400
But not the screaming burn
 victims and the little children

03:56.400 --> 03:58.520
who swallowed bleach.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.120
Back to the ward for me.
I'm out of here.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.400
As soon as I'm finished here,
we'll get some X-rays,

04:03.400 --> 04:06.880
a urinalysis, a blood count, find
out what's causing your bleeding.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.480
I'm going to need another box.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.480
One is enough.
I'll show you.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.800
Mr Bevine is in the moving business.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.800
Bevine and Sons. We do good work.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.480
Have a pen.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.840
Have a pen.
Thank you.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.080
You start with the basics.
Volume. That requires a thorough

04:28.080 --> 04:31.240
understanding of geometric and
dimensional analysis. Interested?

04:31.240 --> 04:32.560
Actually, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.760
Gotcha.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.760
You're on your way.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.040
     And so are we. Follow me.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.040
You're a nice woman. Caring and
sensitive. You belong on the ward.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.000
As soon as you're working
  with long-term patients again,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.040
you'll get back
 that sense of purpose you lost.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.200
How do you know so much about me?

04:48.200 --> 04:51.080
Possession's nine tenths
of the law and human nature.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.080
Liv Ullman's autobiography,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.640
Country New England Inns.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.640
Like my dad says, our lives are
what we shove in a box. Good luck.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.000
My car's still being
fixed at Wolfgang's.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.160
That Stormtrooper is taking me
for every Deutschmark I've got.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.880
Don't forget, I'll need a ride home.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.680
Right out of the meeting and
tossed breakfast, eh, Donald?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.440
How are you feeling?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.280
Chills, sweating, nausea.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.520
Glad to see you're going home.
You could use the rest.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.280
I wish I could. I'm on my way
          over to see Judge Farnham.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.480
What in heaven's name for?

05:20.480 --> 05:23.080
He's chairman of the board, Daniel.
I figure if we could sit down

05:23.080 --> 05:25.280
and talk, maybe I can get these
programmes going one at a time.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.160
I'm going to start with
the family-unit proposal.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.000
The least expensive
and easier to implement.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.400
Go home and rest.
Let Constance take care of you.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.360
No, there's too much to do,
including the parent-teachers'

05:34.360 --> 05:38.360
conference at Tommy's
school this afternoon.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.520
Jack, I'm worried about Pete.
Never says a word, not even a peep.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.160
Of course, I wouldn't talk either
if I was wearing a rat on my head.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.560
        It's a raccoon cap.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.520
Helen! Tie a yellow ribbon,
   welcome back!

05:49.520 --> 05:51.640
Rumour had it
    you were heading this way.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.120
You're really going to work on
the ward and not do the box?

05:54.120 --> 05:57.040
Well, the director of nursing said
I'd be reassigned as head nurse

05:57.040 --> 05:58.600
when the next position
becomes available.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.840
It's always such a hoot
circling the welcome wagons.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.680
Ehrlich, your patient, Mrs
Blaine, was out of her room.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.320
  Little post-op recovery stroll?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.440
Face down in the middle of the hall.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.160
Sherry, Mr Hamilton needs
his sheets changed.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.560
Show him how to ring
for assistance next time.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.040
Helen, the meds need to be done.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.560
Don't forget to sign the
narcotics requisition.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.240
One copy stays here, the other
two are sent to the pharmacy.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.440
         Glad to be back?!

06:24.440 --> 06:27.040
I thought I was!

06:27.040 --> 06:30.720
Nurseries are functional but
not the least bit soothing.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.680
    Bright lights, dark walls.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.560
Nobody singing lullabies.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.360
Always some crybaby
two bassinets over.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.880
We're getting to know
each other, aren't we?

06:40.880 --> 06:44.880
Yes, we are.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.160
She's abandoned.
Father's dead, mother's in a coma.

06:51.160 --> 06:55.160
No-one's able to reach
the other grandparents.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.160
Barbara's been alone too long, Mark.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.920
She should come home with us now.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.160
 I don't think that's a good idea.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.240
Dr Carlisle says she's strong
enough to leave the hospital.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.920
  Of course Mary would say that.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.520
      She wants to get paid.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.440
I mean, what does a paediatrician
have to worry about?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.280
       Giving a booster shot

07:17.280 --> 07:19.880
every couple of months,
taking height and weight

07:19.880 --> 07:21.600
like a prize fighter before a bout?

07:21.600 --> 07:25.600
It's the parents that have to take
care of the kid 24 hours a day.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.000
It's the biggest responsibility
in the world.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
We have to be Barbara's
parents, Mark. At least for now.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.040
We'll talk about it tonight.
You don't have to pick me up.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.040
 I'm catching a ride with Daniel.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.960
Terri, is your check-up
scheduled for today?

07:48.960 --> 07:51.720
Next week.
I wanted to see the babies.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.960
Getting an idea of what
yours might look like?

07:53.960 --> 07:56.720
How about that carrot top?
He's adorable.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.720
Two weeks ago, after you performed
my artificial insemination,

08:01.920 --> 08:05.920
Ken and I thought
for sure I'd get pregnant.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.760
It didn't work, Dr Turner.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.880
I got my period this morning.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.160
What went wrong?

08:13.160 --> 08:17.160
We'll find out. Come on.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.080
You asked for a urology consult,
Dr Fiscus. Let's get on with it.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.400
Patient, Victor Bevine,
37-year-old white male.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.360
Presented this morning in ER.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.280
either he's whizzing blood
or there's too much red dye
   in his Maraschino cherries.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.480
Reschedule Mr Glassman's
IBP for tomorrow.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.360
There's no prior history
     of haematuria.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.679
Medical history is non-contributory.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.280
Which is the same way I feel
about annual giving. It's lame.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.280
Merv, see you
on the squash court, 5:30.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.040
OK.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.680
Family history is
positive for the big C.

08:50.680 --> 08:54.000
Dad had colon cancer and old Grandad
had the same thing as Reagan.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.040
Intestinal polyps?

08:55.040 --> 08:59.040
His wife's name's Nancy.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.880
Kidneys are normal
in size and contour.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.040
  Symmetric function bilaterally.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.040
Renal pelvis and ureters are normal,
without evidence of stones.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.160
However, the bladder's
contracted with an irregular defect.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.760
We'd better take a look
at that lesion.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.360
Set up a time for a cystoscopy,
Dr Wade. You'll be assisting.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.600
Surgical gloves, male genitalia -
you should feel right at home.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.520
            Dr Fiscus.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.080
This procedure's as serious
as any other.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.080
It's not for your
amusement or entertainment.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.040
Mr Bevine will have a cystoscope
inserted through the end of his

09:37.040 --> 09:38.600
      penis into his bladder.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.600
And while it may not be painful,
much like a gynaecological exam,

09:42.880 --> 09:46.400
patients find the process
very humiliating.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.280
I'll schedule the OR for 3:00.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.520
           Make it 3:15.

09:50.520 --> 09:54.520
Urologists act like they've
got the world by the stun needles.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.240
           Oh, brother.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.400
Can't Pete make do someplace else?

10:13.400 --> 10:16.080
Victor,
don't turn it into such a big deal.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.480
You'd better check your
old psych text there.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.840
Freud's sexual development.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.000
This is the crucial stage for Pete.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.760
One mistake here could be
devastating to his personality.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.720
Yeah, and Jack's given him so
little personality to begin with.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.440
We all get twisted
in different ways.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.160
Ask Bob, he was the one making
the splice with the teen dream

10:34.160 --> 10:36.000
in the bathroom stall.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.880
You mean that rumour was true?
You made it with Nadine?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.160
The respiratory therapist
in the ladies' room?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.680
I don't want to talk about it.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.280
Wait a minute, what's this? Hospital
property, five-finger discount.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.880
Look, I'm going up to my house on
the Cape this weekend, I haven't had

10:48.880 --> 10:50.880
a chance to buy towels or sheets.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.240
Don't you worry about your
professional reputation?

10:53.240 --> 10:54.520
I'm going to bring the linen back.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.000
No, I'm talking about
what you did with Nadine.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.320
Look,
why don't you all stop bugging me?

11:01.320 --> 11:03.280
You're lucky someone
didn't catch you.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.440
You're lucky you
didn't catch something.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.440
Singles scene is a dirty
microbiological war
fought in dark places.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.280
     AIDS, gonorrhoea, herpes.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.880
What happened to Joan Halloran?

11:13.880 --> 11:17.880
I am incapable of having
a meaningful relationship.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.200
Take a number, buddy, get in line.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.280
When I broke up with Joan, I said it

11:22.280 --> 11:24.520
was because I didn't understand
what was going on in her head.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.000
All the time, I didn't know
what was going on inside mine.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Having a breakdown.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.000
I'm going to go up
to my house on the Cape. Work on it,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
needs some improvement.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.920
You guys have a good weekend.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.840
I've got to get Pete
down to Susie Larkin.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.520
One of you do me a favour?

11:50.520 --> 11:54.520
Take care of his potty.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.640
Last one out dumps.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.240
                Oh!

12:02.240 --> 12:06.000
   Next time, put the lid down.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh-oh, no show.
The kid's in trouble.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.200
Sorry to keep you waiting, Donald.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.480
Sorry to keep you waiting, Donald.
It's all right.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.640
The jury's just acquitted Mrs
Gilles of the murder of her husband.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.360
Surprised the bejeepers out of me.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.320
          Ah, thank you.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.880
     Something to eat, Donald?

12:37.880 --> 12:38.920
         Cream of celery.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.920
         Cream of celery.
No, thanks.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.240
Not terribly generous, but it'll do.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.480
     You look pretty haggard.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.440
No, I'm fine, just
working through some things.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.640
          Well, sit, sit.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.640
Judge, I would like to go ahead
on the family-unit proposal.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.200
That's the rigmarole about providing

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
a bed next to hospitalised children
so their parents can stay with them?

13:08.520 --> 13:11.520
I've gone over the budget and the
cost would be virtually nothing.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.160
We already have the rollaway beds.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.960
Well, what's the child's average
likely stay at St Eligius?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.120
Three days.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.720
How many children
do you treat a month?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.440
175-200.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.000
   Feeding the parents of, what,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
200 children three meals
a day sounds rather expensive.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.960
Judge, there's just so much a doctor
can do in the healing process.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.960
The presence of family in a time
of illness has incredible power.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.240
        Possibly, possibly.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.960
No, I've seen it work in
Ethiopia, it'll work here.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.840
Your proposal needs to be reviewed

13:45.840 --> 13:47.720
in a thoughtful manner,
and that takes time.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.160
How much time?

13:49.160 --> 13:52.560
I've been on the board of
St Eligius for 15 years.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.880
In that time, I've come to
realise that hospitals are

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
      a lot like courtrooms -

13:56.720 --> 13:59.760
overcrowded,
backlogged, but sooner or later,

13:59.760 --> 14:01.560
everyone gets a fair and due process.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.560
        It's a good system.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Yes?
Where is she now?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.440
        I'll be right down.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.200
On her way out of the building,
Mrs Gilles confessed to reporters

14:16.200 --> 14:18.280
   that she killed her husband.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.520
  A good system, but not perfect.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.520
  Take care of yourself, Donald.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.120
Last time my body felt numb
   like this,

14:35.120 --> 14:37.400
I was moving a refrigerator
and got pinned underneath.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.080
The effects of the spinal
injection will only last a few hours.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.200
You may start feeling some
pressure, Mr Bevine.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.480
As the scope enters your bladder,

14:45.480 --> 14:47.440
passing through
      the sphincter muscle.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.600
Dead end.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.720
Ureteral openings
appear unobstructed.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.400
There's the lesion
on the anterior wall.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.760
Biopsy forceps.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.600
Dr Barton is taking a sample
from the lesion, which will be

14:59.600 --> 15:01.800
   sent to the lab for analysis.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.880
And if the lesion is benign,
this is where it stops, right?

15:03.880 --> 15:07.160
Almost finished, Mr Bevine,
then I remove the scope.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.160
Better than leaving it there.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.200
I'm not saying we shouldn't
see each other again.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.640
You didn't have a very
good time on our first date?

15:18.640 --> 15:21.440
Chandler, you
came to my flute recital,

15:21.440 --> 15:25.360
he took me out to coffee afterwards
and then straight home,

15:25.360 --> 15:27.640
not even a kiss,
just good night Irene.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.960
I wasn't sure what you wanted.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.960
Men. You either treat women like
antique vases or spittoons.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.720
I'll make it up to you tonight.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.440
              Great.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.520
Where do you want to go?

15:40.520 --> 15:44.520
Recital was my pick,
this is your turn, buddy.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.960
Mark!

15:46.960 --> 15:48.560
The police called.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.840
Yvonne's parents have been located.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.120
Are the Galeckis coming here?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.200
Didn't say.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.080
Because you didn't ask.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.880
Why bother transferring to the ward
if you're not going to do the job?

15:58.880 --> 16:01.000
Helen, Mrs Cogan
      says the aminophylline

16:01.000 --> 16:02.800
makes her nauseated
on an empty stomach.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.360
Well, if she'd be more comfortable,
wait and medicate her with lunch.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.720
         Hang on a minute.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.680
That's right, Lucy's still
the head honcho, big cheese.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.840
        Button it, Ehrlich.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.480
You're the boss.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.680
Mrs Cogan's aminophylline
level is being drawn at noon.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.000
Look, I'm not trying to tell you
how to run the ward,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.440
but Sherry could wait two hours.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.440
Stick to the schedule,
if it's not too much trouble.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.800
Awfully chilly around here.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.840
Elliot, pally boy,
I've been looking all over for you.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.120
Luther tells me you took our
little heart to heart to heart.

16:34.120 --> 16:34.840
What about?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.360
Healthy diet and regular exercise.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.200
Here's my contribution to your diet.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.800
The Berkeley no fat, no fun formula
for feeding.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.480
Sounds great, what is this?

16:42.480 --> 16:46.480
Carrot and celery sticks. No salt.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.720
Dr Fiscus.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.240
Let me show you the letter
    my dad dropped off.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.280
It's from the Massachusetts
Board of Underwater Archaeology.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.520
Bevine and Sons has been granted
permission to recover the treasure

17:02.520 --> 17:06.520
of the Ferdinand II Galleon,
sank 25 miles off Wellfleet in 1430.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.680
Aren't you in the moving business?

17:08.680 --> 17:11.200
Well, that's where we make
the money to build our dream.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.119
Bevine and Sons Salvage Crew.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.319
See.
Our boys don't get bad.

17:15.319 --> 17:19.319
It says so right here.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.280
Dr Wade told me that your
biopsy came back positive.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.280
Cancer.
Surgery scheduled for tomorrow.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.560
Dr Barton said he'll probably have
to take out my bladder and replace

17:31.560 --> 17:35.560
it with an ostomy bag I'll
wear on my hip to collect urine.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.120
           Did he, er...

17:38.120 --> 17:41.800
Did he also discuss
the possibility

17:41.800 --> 17:45.280
of your becoming,
you know...

17:45.280 --> 17:47.880
Impotent?
Yeah.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.200
           You doing OK?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.440
           You doing OK?
I've had a good cry,

17:51.440 --> 17:54.640
but I never planned
on children anyway.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.240
You seem to be handing all this
pretty well.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.240
Well, I'm a New England
pragmatist like my dad.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.960
If I don't have this
operation, I'll die.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.920
Besides, I look at the soul of
the man next to me and realise,

18:09.920 --> 18:13.680
my passage here on earth has no
more discernible purpose than his.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.280
From that mystery I fashion
meaning by just being alive.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.040
     Your dad teach you that?

18:19.040 --> 18:22.400
Discovered it on my own,
first day of summer camp,

18:22.400 --> 18:26.400
in the shower.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.200
                Hi.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.800
How's life at the death factory?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.200
You don't want to know, believe me.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.920
            Hi, sport.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.520
I only ask because you were
supposed to be

18:44.520 --> 18:47.040
at the parent-teacher
    conference this afternoon.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.480
             Oh, boy.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.080
     What is going on with me?

18:50.080 --> 18:52.320
It's no problem - I went.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.920
Mrs Elway said Tommy's doing
beautifully since he came back.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.920
Ma. Tommy help.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.200
        Anything I can do?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.680
No, everything's under control.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.960
       Yeah, I can see that.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.720
I'm making a dish that's
     a speciality of Marie's,

19:09.720 --> 19:11.200
the new chef
        at the restaurant.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.200
Afraid I don't have much
of an appetite tonight.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.120
       We're out of aspirin.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.240
I moved the bottle to the bathroom
medicine chest, where it belongs.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.320
Do you want me to get it for you?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.240
       No, that's all right.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.320
I just can't understand why I'm
having so much trouble convincing

19:27.320 --> 19:29.560
these people how important
these outreach programmes are.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.840
Lord knows you've done
nothing but talk about it.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.920
Maybe your next step is action.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.480
Break a few eggs, make an omelette.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.520
Break a few rules,
turn people's heads around.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.200
Make them pay attention.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.200
There's a postcard from
Lizzie on the table.

19:48.040 --> 19:52.040
Sounds like she's having a
ball, driving cross-country.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.120
She didn't tell me that Rick
Messino was going to be with her.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
Didn't she?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.680
You knew and you
didn't tell me, right?

19:57.680 --> 20:01.680
Why, so you could race off
to Montana and rescue her?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.800
You did a good job here, my friend.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.880
          Tommy, come on.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.880
Get out of the way.
No touch.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.280
       I need some aspirin.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.440
Mark, you said we
could talk about Barbara.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.880
   Why do you buy fitted sheets?

20:29.880 --> 20:33.880
It's easier. You're always
criticising my hospital corners.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.040
Well, the snap has
gone out of the elastic.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.080
   It really singes my drawers.

20:40.080 --> 20:44.080
      I'll get another sheet.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.320
I want to bring
Barbara home tomorrow.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.680
               Here.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.680
       Just change the bed.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.760
   I tried to be a good father.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.760
I did my best to weave my son
into the fabric of our family.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.480
       But the older he got,

21:19.480 --> 21:23.080
the less I know how to help,
how to reach him.

21:23.080 --> 21:27.080
I'd offer him advice,
but he'd ignore it.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.800
I was the same lousy father to
Steven that my father was to me.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.320
             Detached.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.520
    I wasn't there for my son.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.240
  You were right. I hurt people.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.320
    It's my fault Steven's dead

21:59.320 --> 22:03.320
      and Yvonne's in a coma.

22:03.440 --> 22:07.440
            I'm sorry.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.320
Well, I guess we...

22:13.320 --> 22:17.320
We can only be the person that
we really are to our children.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.200
You couldn't change yourself
through Steven.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.320
Sometimes we make mistakes in life
and we just have to live with them.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.240
Maybe you weren't
always there for our son,

22:41.240 --> 22:43.840
but I know you're there for Barbara.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.840
I've seen you with her
                     in the nursery.

22:49.440 --> 22:53.440
Barbara needs us, Mark.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.560
         All right, Ellen.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.240
             You win.

23:02.240 --> 23:06.240
We win.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.440
Lady downstairs says our
daughter's here - Yvonne Galecki.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.440
Oh, yes, right this way. Page Dr
Craig, have him meet me in 3404.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.720
We were at my brother's place and
got home and the lady in the next
trailer

23:30.720 --> 23:34.280
said the cops had come by,
said my daughter had been
    in an accident

23:34.280 --> 23:36.240
and was in a coma,
said to come here.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.520
Yes. Yvonne and Steven
were headed for RIT.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.320
Apparently Steven fell asleep
at the wheel. He was killed.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.080
Yes, we know.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.640
The baby's all right, though?

23:45.640 --> 23:49.640
Oh, yes, she's going to be fine.
 She's in our nursery.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.680
Is Yvonne in any pain?

24:10.680 --> 24:11.960
No.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.480
Can she hear us?

24:13.480 --> 24:16.200
There's no way of knowing.

24:16.200 --> 24:20.200
What happened to my girl?

24:32.600 --> 24:36.320
        Mr and Mrs Galecki.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.960
          I'm Mark Craig.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.960
I'm sorry we couldn't have met
under different circumstances.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.560
Your hands are dry.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.560
I've got some lotion.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.280
    I'm personally seeing to it

24:58.280 --> 25:01.120
Yvonne gets the best medical care.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.120
Would you leave us alone
with our daughter, please?

25:12.480 --> 25:16.480
I've made a 12-centimetre incision
just above the bladder.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.280
Very rare for someone as young
as Mr Bevine

25:22.360 --> 25:24.960
 to have a lesion of this nature.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.960
            Retractor.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Please hold the retractor, Dr Wade.

25:42.200 --> 25:46.200
I'd like you to feel inside
the bladder for the lesion.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.160
It appears to involve
    the entire anterior wall.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.080
We'll proceed to remove the bladder

25:58.080 --> 26:01.840
   and perform an ileal conduit.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.840
I'll use a portion of Mr Bevine's
small intestine.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.520
One end will be
connected to the ureter,

26:09.520 --> 26:13.520
 the other to the abdominal wall,

26:13.520 --> 26:17.120
  through which urine will pass.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.880
     Your assessment, Dr Wade?

26:19.880 --> 26:23.200
There's no way to do
a limited operation.

26:23.200 --> 26:27.200
Erectile nerve function
is going to be permanently impaired.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.800
     Help you find something?

26:49.800 --> 26:52.160
Yeah, give me a flat head,
    inch and a half.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.800
I'm rehanging shutters.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.800
Brass, they won't corrode
in the salt air. Anything else?

26:59.720 --> 27:00.000
Hammer.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.160
       You mean screwdriver?

27:01.160 --> 27:05.160
No, I'm also whacking
on a new porch railing.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.160
That's all I've been doing for
the last day, working on my house.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.800
I'm tired of fixing
leaky faucets and replacing old...

27:12.800 --> 27:15.280
Hammers.
Mallet, claw, ball-peen.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.800
Hammers.
Mallet, claw, ball-peen.
Claw.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.280
            15 ounces.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.120
Feels good.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.400
You know my size.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.200
       Let me ring this up.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.560
 Haven't seen you in here before.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.640
I bought the old Rea place
                        a month ago.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.160
Keep finding things
need to be repaired.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.360
Cracked window moulding,
                     sprung doors...

27:37.360 --> 27:40.240
     Doesn't sound too tough.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.680
          My name is Zoe.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.640
Pretty name.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.720
     It means "life" in Greek.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.480
So, you own this place?

27:45.480 --> 27:49.480
It's my father's, I watch it for
him in the mornings, he goes fishing.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.800
What time do you get off?

27:58.120 --> 28:00.080
Ken took the shuttle to New York.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.960
He had a meeting on Wall Street.
I didn't tell him I got my period.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.280
  He's going to know eventually.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.320
I wanted to find out first.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.200
What happened?

28:10.200 --> 28:14.200
Terri, I assumed the acidity
of the mucus was holding us up.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.200
       It's the most common.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.640
    I was partially right, but

28:18.640 --> 28:20.920
the X-rays we took show your
fallopian tubes are blocked.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.080
the X-rays we took show your
fallopian tubes are blocked.
Blocked? How?

28:22.080 --> 28:26.080
Scarring, making them
inflexible and impassable.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.480
What causes that?

28:28.480 --> 28:31.560
Lots of things.
It could be complications related to

28:31.560 --> 28:33.920
the IUD you used to use.
Oh, great.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.640
So what's the next step?

28:35.640 --> 28:37.880
           Dr Morrison?

28:37.880 --> 28:41.880
Two choices. The first is to
surgically open up the tubes.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.600
It's a delicate operation
with only moderate success.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.880
Door number two?

28:47.880 --> 28:51.480
In-vitro fertilisation.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.720
What we do is

28:53.720 --> 28:57.720
we start you on a fertility drug
called HMG,

28:59.080 --> 29:02.040
and then we follow the growth
of the eggs with ultrasound.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.000
When they mature,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.680
you'll be medicated
in order to stimulate ovulation.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.680
36 hours later, Dr Turner will
harvest as many eggs as possible,

29:12.880 --> 29:15.600
which we'll fertilise
   in the lab with Ken's sperm,

29:15.600 --> 29:18.200
and then put back in the uterus.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.480
How soon would you do this?

29:19.480 --> 29:21.280
Couple of weeks.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.560
But first, you'd better talk
the procedure over with Ken.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.760
Yeah, of course.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.120
You know, in the '60s, the point was
to have sex without having babies.

29:30.120 --> 29:34.120
I guess I've come full circle,
  babies without sex.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.320
(TANNOY) 'Charlotte Dean,
paediatrics, Charlotte Dean,
paediatrics.'

29:51.560 --> 29:54.680
While you're here in Boston,
we'd love to have you stay with us.

29:54.680 --> 29:58.680
   After all, we're family now.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.720
That's real nice, but Patty and me
are going back to Clinton tonight.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.720
Going to make arrangements
to bring Vonny home.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.960
That's a good idea. I have the name

30:07.960 --> 30:11.200
of a top-rated neurologist
    at the Medical Centre.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.800
We've got a good hospital nearby.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.240
It's not as nice as this one,
  but they're good people.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.640
They sewed my son Glen's
hand together after he...

30:19.640 --> 30:22.880
cut it up on a piece of scrap metal.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.840
I understand you work at a museum.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.520
Mm-hmm. Security guard.

30:29.520 --> 30:33.520
Yvonne told us you had a Thomas
Cole exhibit there recently.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.480
Yeah, yeah. Real big affair.

30:36.480 --> 30:40.000
Lot of people came through.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.360
Mark and I are very fond of Yvonne.

30:43.360 --> 30:47.360
We thought your Stevie was terrific,
too. He and Gene
got along real good.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.040
You visited Steven in Columbus?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.800
Once.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.400
You take I-90 West Cleveland and...

30:53.400 --> 30:57.400
71 south to Columbus. I'm
familiar with the highway system.

30:59.840 --> 31:03.840
Mostly,
Vonny and Steve came to visit us.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.920
Me and him would go
for some draughts and darts.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.760
Good boy.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.560
Great dart player too.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.360
Made me feel like I was
back in school again myself.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.800
Really?
What grade?

31:17.800 --> 31:21.040
           Mark, please.

31:21.040 --> 31:25.040
Is there a Goodwill
    or Salvation Army nearby?

31:25.920 --> 31:28.120
We have to stop before we leave to
pick up a car seat for baby Barbara.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.920
Car seat?

31:29.920 --> 31:31.560
It's New York state law.
You've got to have one.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.160
          We already do.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.760
          We already do.
You mean we can use yours?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.480
Sure, when you come to visit or

31:37.480 --> 31:40.440
to take Barbara to Clinton
    to see her mother.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.800
Barbara will see her all the time.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.800
What do you mean?

31:48.520 --> 31:51.720
When Yvonne and Steve found out they
were pregnant, they asked us to be

31:51.720 --> 31:54.240
Barbara's guardians in case
anything happened to them.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.200
      You're taking Barbara?

31:57.200 --> 32:01.200
It's a copy of their will.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.880
Any beds that won't fit on
the ward, we'll put in storage.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.080
There's a utility closet
at the end of the hall.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.280
What's all the commotion?

32:12.280 --> 32:13.600
   I'm starting the family unit.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.000
Judge Farnham gave approval?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.600
We have to keep these
families together.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.440
I'm having trouble making
Constance understand that.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.560
What are you talking about?

32:20.560 --> 32:23.880
Donald, you can't
create this kind of anarchy.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.040
 Playing by the rules doesn't pay.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.040
These people are sick and the
camp has to take care of them.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.080
You're not
bigger than this institution.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.760
The board won't tolerate
your actions.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.640
They'll fire you, and you
won't be of use to anyone.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.080
           It's too hot.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.000
I have to remember that.
What time is it, do you know?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.040
You're not making any sense.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.120
We have to get these people
out of the sun, out of the sun.

32:43.120 --> 32:47.120
Donald!

32:56.360 --> 32:58.640
Donald was only bruised by the fall.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.240
What caused him to black out?

33:00.240 --> 33:03.080
My guess is, it was a resistant
strain of malaria

33:03.080 --> 33:05.200
that he picked up
      on his trip to Africa.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.640
Until the blood tests come back,
we won't know for sure.

33:07.640 --> 33:08.760
How is he now?

33:08.760 --> 33:10.280
Resting comfortably.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.880
Check it and see.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.760
Donald had a fever of 103.
He was delirious.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.480
That's a tough condition to
detect in my brother-in-law.

33:17.480 --> 33:21.160
Excuse me. Dr Thorpe needs a
consult on a hepatoma resection

33:21.160 --> 33:23.240
with bleeding in the OR.
You must be Aunt Constance?

33:23.240 --> 33:23.840
Yes.

33:23.840 --> 33:27.840
I'm on my way.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.760
I knew something like this
    was going to happen.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.360
          Course you did.

33:39.360 --> 33:43.240
 Constance, nothing's working out.

33:43.240 --> 33:46.840
Look, you went to Ethiopia
because you were tired and restless.

33:46.840 --> 33:50.480
You dismantled your life,
left Boston.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.680
You know what?

33:52.680 --> 33:54.720
People go on.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.960
They worked through the
void your departure created.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.960
Don't lecture me,
Constance, just listen.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.040
A woman at the camp's
teenage son died.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.159
She was trying to comprehend that.

34:10.159 --> 34:14.159
 Stood over him, waving her arms,

34:14.679 --> 34:16.639
    half-crazed, half-dancing,

34:16.639 --> 34:20.639
trying to push the air
back into her son's open mouth.

34:24.320 --> 34:28.040
         I feel like that.

34:28.040 --> 34:32.040
The things I came back to accomplish,
nobody seems to care about.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.159
My daughter doesn't trust
me enough to tell me she's

34:37.159 --> 34:41.159
running off with her boyfriend.
My son doesn't know me any more.

34:43.480 --> 34:47.480
Shows more affection
towards you than me.

34:48.679 --> 34:52.679
Donald, I think you make life
more complicated than it has to be.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.760
My advice, stay in bed.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.760
I'm going to pick up Tommy
    from school.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.840
So St Peter asked him
"How did you get here?"

35:02.840 --> 35:06.840
And the golfer says "In two".

35:09.760 --> 35:11.400
        Mr Bevine doing OK?

35:11.400 --> 35:15.400
He's fine.
Let's get some coffee.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.600
You know, Wayne, I've
noticed under all the

35:17.600 --> 35:21.520
gallows humour, you're taking this
case more personally than usual.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.000
Don't you every time
you do a hysterectomy?

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
No.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.640
Jacqueline, I feel like I
don't know myself any more.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.000
I mean, I'm the guy that
made love to Kathy Martin

35:41.000 --> 35:44.680
in every room of this hospital,
including Dr Auschlander's office.

35:44.680 --> 35:45.680
You did?

35:45.680 --> 35:48.800
You ought to get out a
little more, you know that?

35:48.800 --> 35:52.800
In any case, over the past two
months, I've had no interest in

35:53.760 --> 35:55.440
     quick, empty snorkelling.

35:55.440 --> 35:59.320
Loss of sex drive could mean
liver, kidney or pituitary disease.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.320
Get your mind out of the gutter.
I want marriage, love, kids.

36:03.800 --> 36:07.400
I want a little guy
crawling up my legs.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.840
 I'll tell you what I don't want.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.400
A cold sore?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.440
             No, this.

36:12.440 --> 36:16.040
Are you worried that when you're
ready, potency will pass you by?

36:16.040 --> 36:19.360
15% of men get a varicose
vein on one of their testicles.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.000
This reduces sperm production,
and that can cause infertility.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.320
But there's not anything
we can do about it.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.320
          Yes, there is.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.680
Beautiful day.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.120
Why don't we drive to Provincetown,
visit the Pilgrim Monument?

36:36.120 --> 36:39.320
I hear at the top, you can
see all the way to Boston.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.880
Nice house.
Upstairs and downstairs.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.560
Pretty maids and handsome masters.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.640
It's never that way.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.640
                No?

36:54.320 --> 36:58.320
# Mrs Brown,
   you've got a lovely daughter

36:59.680 --> 37:03.680
# Girls like her
are really something rare... #

37:07.840 --> 37:11.720
I need to use the bathroom.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.720
    Through there on your left.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.760
Listen, maybe your father
wants to go fishing again.

37:30.760 --> 37:34.760
Might need someone to mind the store.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.640
We're staying here.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.680
      It's such a great day.

37:42.680 --> 37:46.680
 Sunny, 85 degrees cool breeze...

37:50.640 --> 37:52.480
Nice going, Donald.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.120
How did you let this happen?

37:54.120 --> 37:56.480
  I took my malaria prophylaxis.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.680
I'm talking about getting
    my friend Judge Farnham

37:59.680 --> 38:03.160
all nutsed up
over your outreach programmes.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.680
I'll be up on my feet
in about two weeks.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.680
How are you feeling?

38:06.680 --> 38:07.480
              Lousy.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.280
You look lousy.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.760
It's your own fault for not getting
a physical when you got home.

38:10.760 --> 38:11.760
   Why did you talk to Farnham?

38:11.760 --> 38:13.520
Well,

38:13.520 --> 38:16.720
the Galeckis blew in this afternoon.
You should see these people.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.720
They make pre-arranged marriages
seem like forward thinking.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.440
The wife is harmless
enough, but the husband?

38:24.440 --> 38:25.720
A real tool user.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.040
       Mark, I'm really not

38:28.040 --> 38:29.960
very clear-headed right now. What
does this have to do with Farnham?

38:29.960 --> 38:33.600
It seems that Steven
and Yvonne designated the Galeckis

38:33.600 --> 38:36.840
to be Barbara's guardians.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.840
I was hoping the judge would grant
a habeas corpus and stop them from

38:41.360 --> 38:44.680
taking her, but all he wanted to
yak about was your damned proposals.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.680
The Galeckis even brought a copy
 of Steve and Vonny's will.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.960
Like I wouldn't take
their word for it.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.720
            Would you?

38:52.720 --> 38:55.960
Are you out of your mind?

38:55.960 --> 38:56.800
       Looks genuine to me.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.920
Well, when did you
make the Law Review?

38:59.920 --> 39:02.920
Ridiculous.
Steven would want me and Ellen

39:02.920 --> 39:05.280
to take care of his daughter.

39:05.280 --> 39:09.040
Must have written this will
   in a drunken stupor.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.360
I want Barbara to have the brightest

39:11.360 --> 39:15.360
future possible, not spend her
formative years in a trailer park.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.360
The Galeckis
    may take my granddaughter

39:18.360 --> 39:21.040
this evening, but you can bet
that I'll get her back before

39:21.040 --> 39:25.040
she's had her diapers changed.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.800
I want to have the
in-vitro fertilisation.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.440
Have you discussed it with Ken?

39:31.440 --> 39:34.320
I called him in New York.
The Dow's up by almost eight points.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.840
He's bullish on utilities
and having children.

39:36.840 --> 39:40.840
I'll walk you down to the pharmacy.
Let's get you started on your HMG.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.280
Two weeks ago,

39:49.280 --> 39:51.960
when I passed out
    the sperm bank donor form,

39:51.960 --> 39:53.840
you could have cared less.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.640
You said - I'll never forget this -
you said you didn't like the idea of

39:57.640 --> 40:00.720
your flesh and blood walking around
without you knowing it.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.400
Get off my back.
I changed my mind, OK?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.240
That reminds me.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.040
Change the sheets too.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.200
For two years, you've been a stick.
Now you're doing jokes?

40:12.200 --> 40:14.440
Wayne, hey.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.400
Relax.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.680
Drop in.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.680
Any time.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.200
I have an Auto Club card.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.680
No.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.600
Don't need it. Alternator
shorts out from time to time.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.080
I just take another matchbook cover
and go between the wheel well.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.480
Of course.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.400
Does this thing have seatbelts?

40:44.400 --> 40:47.280
 Will you come and visit Barbara?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.680
Of course.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.160
  It's hard to leave Yvonne here.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.120
I'm afraid she might die
before I get back.

40:55.120 --> 40:59.120
CAR HORN BEEPS

41:00.040 --> 41:04.040
I want to help with the additional
expenses of caring for Barbara.

41:15.320 --> 41:19.320
Ellen, the Galeckis
have a long drive home.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.600
Give Mrs Galecki the baby.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.840
Handle your wife!

41:23.840 --> 41:25.640
            Gene, stop.

41:25.640 --> 41:29.640
No.
I'm finished being polite.

41:34.640 --> 41:37.120
You're rich and selfish.
You've got no notion

41:37.120 --> 41:39.080
what it is to raise a kid.
Steve told me all about you.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.000
What happened between Steven
and us is none of your business.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.560
Look at what he did to my daughter,

41:44.560 --> 41:46.720
then tell me that's
none of my business.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.720
Give us our granddaughter.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.800
I'll get her back.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.800
I promise.

42:05.280 --> 42:09.040
(BABY GURGLES)

42:09.040 --> 42:13.040
I'll see you in court, Galecki.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.440
   Hi. What are you doing here?

42:54.440 --> 42:58.440
   Hi. What are you doing here?
Daddy.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.320
If this works in Ethiopia,
no reason it shouldn't work here.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.520
    I'm glad you're here, son.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.880
Daddy better?

43:22.880 --> 43:26.880
               Yeah.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.880
One day I'll put new
plumbing in this house.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.880
    Get me a deal on some pipe.

43:42.080 --> 44:31.000
You know, you were right
about me in the store.
