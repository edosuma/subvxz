WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:06.128
- You okay?
- No.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.764
<i>I spent my life running from Hunting,
I never wanted this for you and Sam.</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:15.051
It just feels like yesterday,
we were together in Heaven. And now...

00:15.880 --> 00:18.451
Mom. What are you trying to say?

00:19.160 --> 00:20.286
I have to go.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.731
DEAN: <i>This whole Mom thing, it's...</i>

00:23.960 --> 00:26.167
I mean, we get her back,
and then she leaves.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.601
AARON: <i>My grandfather spent
the rest of his life trying to track down</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:30.450
something he called the Thule Society.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.440
<i>They were this twisted, secret fraternity,
hell-bent on world domination</i>

00:34.680 --> 00:36.808
that sponsored the early days
of the Nazi Party.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.562
SAM: <i>This last page is a roster</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:41.969
of every dead Thule member
who was reanimated.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.646
This is why they killed my grandfather?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.570
You Nazi pig.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.929
SAM: <i>One Rabbi Isaac Bass.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:50.730
He spontaneously combusted.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.081
Nazi bastards.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.480
Anything in there on how to kill it?

01:08.720 --> 01:13.408
If you want a friend of the Thule
to stay dead, burn the body.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.445
You will never kill all the Thule.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.331
Long live the Thule.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.086
Hello?

01:46.040 --> 01:50.045
Oh. Mrs. Lloyd. You're early.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.322
I'm always early. Where is it?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.406
All business, I like that.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.329
1931, solid gold.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.411
Look at that craftsmanship. Mmm?

02:07.320 --> 02:11.006
No ma'am, they don't
make them like this anymore.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.527
Beautiful.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.651
- I brought cash.
- How thoughtful.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.450
Unfortunately, there has been a change.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.881
In the price.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.049
W... We had a deal.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.890
Well, you call it a deal,
I call it the start of negotiations.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.202
You know, tomato-tomahto.

02:37.640 --> 02:42.043
I couldn't let it go for less than 80.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.330
Are you out of your mind?

02:44.600 --> 02:48.571
Well, I am not, but you folks
are mad about this stuff.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.444
I mean, personally,

02:51.280 --> 02:53.248
I don't, uh, see the appeal.

02:54.240 --> 02:59.087
But, if you're not interested,
I can always, uh, find a new buyer.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.283
Do you know who you're talking to?

03:01.520 --> 03:03.443
Good luck finding that "new buyer"

03:03.640 --> 03:05.847
when the community finds out
how I've been treated.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.046
Fine. Your loss.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.641
Wait.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.961
What's that?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.848
Oh, I don't...

03:57.440 --> 03:59.488
Hey. Got everything on the list.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.721
So what are you thinking?
Scrambled or fried?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.321
I'm not really hungry right now.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.400
You're not that...

04:10.680 --> 04:11.681
How about some pie?

04:13.840 --> 04:14.966
Maybe later.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.969
Kind of in the middle of something.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.885
All right. Dude. Something's wrong.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.401
No.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.370
- I get it. With Mom...
- I'm gonna stop you right there. Okay?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.001
Look, Mom needed her space,
and I told you, I'm cool with it.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.521
But are you really?

04:35.760 --> 04:36.886
Happened last night.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.443
"Two Killed in Mystery Fire."

04:40.680 --> 04:41.920
Mmm-hmm.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.927
"Mystery fire?â€œ"

04:44.840 --> 04:47.525
Yeah, the kind that doesn't burn
anything but the bodies.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.530
So spontaneous combustion.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.087
- What are you thinking, a witch? Dragon?
- Maybe.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.203
Check it out, the old lady? Loaded.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.000
I'm talking Scrooge McDuck
swimming in pools of money.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.127
So, what's a lady like that
doing at some crap store, at 3:00 a.m.?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.245
Well, it says it was an antique shop.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.121
So?

05:06.760 --> 05:09.331
So, rich people like antiquing.
I don't know.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.761
I say we check it out.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.651
All right. In the meantime,
you sure you don't wanna talk about...

05:15.880 --> 05:16.961
No.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.330
Dean, it's called sublimation.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.050
Yeah. That's kind of my thing.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.642
- Looks like we missed the cavalry.
- I guess we should go home then.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.011
All right.
I'm guessing that's the first victim.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.927
- Scrooge McDuck lady? Hmm.
- Yeah. Hmm.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.883
Which makes this the antiques dealer.

06:10.280 --> 06:14.444
Yeah. Name was Marvin Brickie. Widower.
Owned the shop for decades.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.281
No sulfur.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.406
Ditto EMF.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.931
Maybe hex bags?

06:24.880 --> 06:29.124
Yeah. Or, you know,
antique shop, full of old stuff.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.522
Maybe the guy got his hands
on a cursed object,

06:31.760 --> 06:33.888
and it went haywire,
started killing everybody.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.640
- Yeah, wouldn't be the first time.
- Right.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.845
Dean.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.165
- Dude.
- Don't say it.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.691
Maybe let's not touch anything

06:58.880 --> 07:01.121
until we figure out if this stuff
wants to kill us or not?

07:01.320 --> 07:02.526
Yeah, I got it.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.241
Sam, I think I found something.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.201
It looks like the victims
were meeting about an antique

07:58.400 --> 08:01.006
<i>- pocket watch the night they died.</i>
- Pocket watch?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.208
Yeah, according to Marv's email at least.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.490
- Uh, Sam?
- Yeah, hold up. Get this.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.730
I hacked into Marv's hard drive.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.490
It looks like he was conducting an

08:15.760 --> 08:18.889
<i>entire underground business,
catering to...</i>

08:20.080 --> 08:21.320
Nazi nutjobs?

08:22.320 --> 08:25.005
Yeah. How'd you know that?

08:26.720 --> 08:27.881
Might wanna take a look at this.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.764
Yeah, what are you, uh...

08:33.080 --> 08:35.924
Oh, that's, uh... Wow.

08:36.360 --> 08:41.446
Yeah. Looks like Scrooge McDuck lady
got her rocks off by collecting Nazi crap.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.331
Yeah. Guess so.
Uh, according to Marv's ledger,

08:44.560 --> 08:47.245
the watch belonged to
a member of Hitler's inner circle.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.245
- So where is it now?
- I don't know.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.205
The police didn't report finding it,
and I'm gonna go out on a limb here

08:53.440 --> 08:57.411
and guess that it's probably not out there
and probably not in here.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.445
- Yeah.
- I mean, Nazi connection.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.682
The immolation MO?
Sound like anybody we know?

09:05.440 --> 09:06.521
The Thule.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.009
Maybe they crashed the party, took
the watch, and torched the bystanders.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.001
Nazis.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.650
I hate these guys.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.524
This is, this is fun.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.930
I don't really ever do this.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.165
And everyone's like, "Watch out
for the hookup culture, Ellie." Mmm.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.287
I think they just worry because, you know,
I just got out of a relationship.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.848
But, no, no,
I gave back the ring, so that's just...

09:49.040 --> 09:51.361
That's all, that's a good thing, right?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.647
Sorry. Yeah, that was... I'm, kind of,

09:55.840 --> 09:59.162
still figuring out how the whole,
you know, Tinder thing works...

09:59.400 --> 10:01.164
- It's cool.
- Yeah, but like...

10:02.160 --> 10:04.561
I could be cooler, let's be honest.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.207
Because, you know,
like your beard is super cool.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.567
Uh, do you want a drink?

10:08.800 --> 10:14.045
Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna use
the little girl's room and just...

10:14.400 --> 10:15.526
Okay.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.527
on, God.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.127
Come on, Eleanore. He is hot!

10:29.440 --> 10:33.570
So you just, you put on
those big girl pants and you take off his.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.891
Well, regular pants. Not big girl pants.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.610
MAN: <i>Hey!</i>

10:44.920 --> 10:46.763
What are you doing? Ellie?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.681
Ow!

11:36.560 --> 11:39.882
- Idiot. We need her alive!
- I'm sorry, Father.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.847
It doesn't matter.
We have what we need to track her.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.246
Come.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.562
AARON: <i>We're halfway through the ledger.
I nailed six, and the golem got the rest.</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:03.685
<i>It feels good. You know, finishing
what the Judah Initiative started.</i>

12:03.960 --> 12:05.007
Your grandfather'd be proud.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.330
Yeah, well, dropping out of college
to wipe out.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.609
<i>Nazi corpse-bags wasn't exactly my
mother's dream, but what are you gonna do?</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:16.442
Hey, hear about any Thule activity
in our neck of the woods?

12:16.840 --> 12:19.810
Nah, lately these deutsch-nozzles
have been sticking to the Fatherland.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.650
<i>- Lately?</i>
- Yeah.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.164
They're closing ranks, all jumpy.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.441
Any idea what's cooking?

12:28.720 --> 12:30.404
Whatever it is, it's big.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.370
We got our hands
on a few of their documents,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.329
code-named the mission, <i>"Das Blut."</i>

12:34.840 --> 12:36.046
<i>"The Blood."</i>

12:36.680 --> 12:39.524
- Well, that sounds nice and ominous.
<i>- Right?</i>

12:39.880 --> 12:41.609
I mean, we're talking the whole enchilada.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.370
The Thule High Command all in one place.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.001
Hey, does a... Does a pocket watch
mean anything to you? Nazi-relic wise?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.681
<i>No, sorry.</i>

12:50.920 --> 12:52.490
Hey, another body just dropped.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.882
Aaron, we're gonna
have to call you back, bud.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.370
By the time we got there,
he was ash and bone.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.009
What does that to a human being?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.201
You find anything else?

13:08.440 --> 13:11.046
Just the body. The other victim was lucky.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.282
She got away,
ran to her neighbor's, called for help.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.085
So where's this survivor now?

13:23.800 --> 13:27.247
What's going on? I already gave
my statement. What is happening?

13:27.520 --> 13:29.727
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! No. No, no, no.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.605
Let me out! Somebody help! Help!

13:32.840 --> 13:35.525
Somebody help me! Let me out of here!

13:35.960 --> 13:41.091
Help! Please! Please, please, please!
Let me out of here!

13:44.120 --> 13:45.849
Help! Please! Please, please, please!
Help me!

13:46.080 --> 13:47.764
- You see that?
- Yeah.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.400
We gotta follow that car.
Oh, I've always wanted to say that.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.445
ELLIE: Why are you doing this to me?

13:58.640 --> 14:01.769
Please. Okay, look, look, I will give you
whatever you want, okay?

14:01.960 --> 14:04.691
I don't really have any money,
but my grandparents left me stocks.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.287
- Just please, tell me what's going on...
- Oh, my God!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.881
Do you ever shut up? Man.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.330
Where are you going?
Hey, you can't leave me here!

14:13.640 --> 14:14.766
Hey!

14:26.080 --> 14:28.606
Father. Yes, I have her.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.644
<i>I'm here now. It's all locked.</i>

14:30.960 --> 14:32.530
That is not fair.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.571
You know, I try with you.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.805
I really do but you expect me to be
a mind-reader, and it's exhausting.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.051
Father, I gotta go.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.804
Well, family drama's a bitch, ain't it?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.648
Move.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.802
So if you're not cops, then what are you?

14:59.680 --> 15:02.650
There are things out there
that shouldn't exist. Bad things.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.325
We kill them. It's kind of our job.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.363
Yeah, so your safest place
is with us, right now.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.241
Uh-huh.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.246
Safe from Nazi zombies?

15:11.480 --> 15:15.804
Necromancers. They use blood magic
to make themselves almost immortal.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.041
Almost?

15:17.320 --> 15:20.529
Well, shoot them in the head, set them
on fire. That usually does the trick.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.846
This is completely insane.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.805
Ellie, you saw
what they did to your friend.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.245
Okay, but why would they kill Nick?
And why kidnap me?

15:32.680 --> 15:34.409
Those are great questions.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.209
What do you tools want with the watch?
And what does it have to do with her?

15:39.120 --> 15:40.690
You're gonna have to kill me.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.683
- All right. Wanna, uh...
- Yep.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.804
- All right, let's go for a walk...
- Wait. No, no. You can't just shoot him.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.162
Oh, no, sure I can.
See, I do it all the time.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.449
- Oh...
- You don't wanna watch this.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.888
All right, all right, all right.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.930
It belongs to my father.
Commandant Nauhaus.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.528
Thule High Command, ranking officer?

16:07.840 --> 16:10.889
Okay. You see,
that wasn't so hard now, was it?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.041
Carry on.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.091
You don't understand. He'll kill me.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.243
What do you think this is, tickle-party?

16:25.240 --> 16:27.527
It started at the end of the war.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.766
<i>Soviets had surrounded the FÃ¼hrerbunker.
Everyone knew it was over.</i>

16:34.120 --> 16:36.168
<i>Everyone except my father.</i>

17:16.319 --> 17:18.891
DEAN: <i>All right, skip the foreplay.
What did your dad do to Hitler?</i>

17:19.119 --> 17:22.282
He saved his life.
Well, he saved his soul.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.969
Like, literally. The watch, it's like a,
it's like a Horcrux.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.211
- It's a Harry Potter thing.
- Oh, you would know that.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.485
Anyways, so the watch holds Hitler's soul?

17:38.800 --> 17:39.926
Right.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.406
You trapped Hitler's soul
in a pocket watch.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.563
Oh, why is that? For safekeeping?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.481
No. To bring him back.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.008
It sounded bonkers to me
the first time I heard it, too.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.846
The first time you heard it?
Weren't you there?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.001
What?

17:58.240 --> 18:01.005
No, man, I was born in Buffalo in '94.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.968
Listen, this whole "let's bring Hitler
back" is more of an OG Thule plan.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.804
All they do is yap about it.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.401
He's joking, right? Right? This is a joke!

18:09.680 --> 18:12.160
DEAN: Okay. Let's back up
to the part where your dad

18:12.440 --> 18:14.841
is going to resurrect Adolf Hitler.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.885
After the bunker,

18:18.360 --> 18:21.842
the Thule agents who were smuggling
Hitler's soul out got whacked by Soviets.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.770
- So you lost the watch.
- Hey, I didn't lose it.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.769
It ended up with some Russian family.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.964
<i>Then the Thule tracked it to China,
and then to Peru.</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:31.441
<i>Then it wound up in that antique shop.</i>

18:31.640 --> 18:34.644
So now, they're all hyped to get
their FÃ¼hrer resurrection on.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.686
This isn't a joke. Oh, my God.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.440
How're they planning on bringing him back?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.890
The soul of Hitler can only inhabit the
body of somebody who possesses his blood.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.043
His blood? <i>Das Blut?</i>

18:48.320 --> 18:49.446
So let me get this straight,

18:49.680 --> 18:53.844
the Thule wants to upload Hitler
into the body of one of his relatives?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.201
Do they even exist anymore?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.564
Well, there's one right there.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.560
Wait, wait,
you think I'm related to Hitler?

19:06.720 --> 19:09.291
Okay, okay, that is just hilarious!

19:09.560 --> 19:11.210
Been keeping tabs on you your whole life.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.562
The Thule track
all of Hitler's descendants,

19:13.760 --> 19:17.162
you just happened to be in the same state
as the watch.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.403
- Go figure.
- No. No way! Okay?

19:19.600 --> 19:22.763
My mom, she tracked our family
all the way back to the Mayflower.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.684
- She used an...
- You're adopted.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.765
- You don't know anything about me.
- You're from Wheaton, Illinois.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.764
All-state cross country, all four years.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.922
Wow! Way to use the Internet.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.685
You were training to become a doctor,

19:33.920 --> 19:36.082
but you dropped out
at the sight of your first stiff.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.563
I am taking a sabbatical.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.604
You dipped town
two days before your wedding.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.768
He was banging our caterer!

19:44.880 --> 19:47.451
<i>It seems as though
this running is a thing for you.</i>

19:52.480 --> 19:53.606
See?

19:55.040 --> 19:56.246
SAM: <i>Yeah, I got her.</i>

19:56.480 --> 19:58.005
- We gotta move.
- I know.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.007
Hey.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.165
How you holding up?

20:15.960 --> 20:19.965
Well, I, uh, texted my mom,
asked if I was adopted.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.769
She wrote, "Honey. Call us."

20:25.560 --> 20:28.006
That guy out there
just flipped my life inside out in, like,

20:28.120 --> 20:29.326
five seconds.

20:30.160 --> 20:35.007
Ellie, I know it probably feels like that
right now, but you can handle this.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.446
Being a little flighty I can handle.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.962
Being related to the biggest
genocidal maniac of all time?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.765
I don't think so!

20:48.400 --> 20:50.323
It's been crazy hot lately, right?

20:52.680 --> 20:54.045
Global warming.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.641
She's close.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.282
I know it's hard to believe this
right now, but it will get easier.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.648
Trust me, I've been there.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.205
Right. Did someone want to use you
to resurrect Adolf Hitler?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.725
- Uh, no, not exactly.
- There you go.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.970
But they did want me
to bring back Lucifer. I was his vessel...

21:36.200 --> 21:40.569
You almost, almost had me
with Hitler but, Lucifer?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.330
Really? The Devil?

21:43.640 --> 21:45.642
I can't, okay? I can't do this.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.531
All right, meltdown time's over.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.688
See, you need to face this. Now.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.730
Believe it or not, we actually
have the upper hand here. According to...

22:00.960 --> 22:03.088
You know, Junior Jackass in there,
the Thule want you.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.641
Now we can use that, we could set a trap.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.287
Oh. Oh, now you want to use me as bait?

22:08.560 --> 22:11.530
We don't want
to use you as bait, Ellie, but...

22:12.480 --> 22:16.326
We have the opportunity to take out
the entire Thule High Command in one shot.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.611
Now, does that sound scary? Yeah, you bet.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.609
But there are times when you run, and
there are times when you stand and fight.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.005
Now is one of those times when you fight.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.601
Now, we promise
that we will keep you safe.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.367
Oh, my God.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.046
You gotta be kidding me.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.491
Get down.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.164
- They're in there.
- Yeah, yeah. Shh.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.841
NAUHAUS ON RADIO: <i>Retreat.</i>

24:12.040 --> 24:13.087
Go!

24:21.760 --> 24:22.841
Ellie.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.040
Dean! We got a problem.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.928
- Hello.
- Hey! Help!

24:54.160 --> 24:56.242
- She's still not picking up.
- Awesome.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.085
Maybe she got spooked.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.210
Well, isn't running
a whole thing with her?

25:02.920 --> 25:04.922
ELLIE <i>ON VOICEMAIL:

25:08.200 --> 25:10.726
<i>Listen, I know
all this Hitler stuff is confusing,</i>

25:11.160 --> 25:13.925
<i>but I promise we can explain it
and we can keep you safe.</i>

25:14.120 --> 25:15.849
<i>Just call me back, okay?</i>

25:16.400 --> 25:18.243
- How could you tell them about Hitler?
- I can explain.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.603
It wasn't bad enough being hunted
by the <i>Jude</i> and his revolting golem.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.407
I was stalling.
They would've killed me and taken her.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.001
You should be thanking me.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.561
You were supposed to be my heir,

25:31.720 --> 25:35.611
instead, you're
an inconceivable disappointment.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.169
No, I used to look up to you.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.371
You conquered death,
you did so many things, but now?

25:44.160 --> 25:47.801
Now, all you want to do
is relive your glory days. With Hitler.

25:47.960 --> 25:53.524
Your generation, you millennials
are too weak to steward the future.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.641
It needs a stronger hand.
The world is divided und inflamed.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.442
This falling of empires,
flailing of economies

26:02.640 --> 26:07.282
is precisely why there has never been
a better time for the FÃ¼hrer's return.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.084
<i>Und</i> you...

26:17.080 --> 26:18.320
my dear,

26:20.840 --> 26:22.251
you have his eyes.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.251
Help! Somebody help me, please!
Please help me!

26:30.000 --> 26:32.207
Well, there's gotta be
a tracking spell, right?

26:33.640 --> 26:35.290
Yeah, maybe if we had something to track.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.241
Well, guess we hack every traffic light
in the city until we find her.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.609
Begin the purification ritual.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.202
A patrol has been sent
to find the Winchesters.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.601
Good.

27:09.880 --> 27:14.044
Fritz, my son has had a very trying day.
He should rest.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.282
What? Hey, no, I'm... What are you doing?

27:19.520 --> 27:22.364
Get your hands off me, ass clown.
What are you doing?

27:22.560 --> 27:27.726
Father! Please! I was wrong,
we can do it your way! Father, please!

27:29.080 --> 27:31.606
Fritz. Look,
you don't have to do this, okay?

27:31.800 --> 27:35.088
Come on. Listen, please,
you know who I am.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.287
Go on.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.320
Anything?

28:11.360 --> 28:14.648
No. I mean, I have no idea
how we're gonna find her.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.765
Even if we look at...

28:17.440 --> 28:18.487
Hi.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.961
If you wanna find Ellie,
you have to protect me.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.210
Protect you?
Why should we believe anything you say?

28:28.720 --> 28:30.563
Don't look now.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.850
Across the street, there's a Thule agent,
right beside the dumpster outside.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.445
Is that enough?

28:41.360 --> 28:43.249
I just killed one of my dad's guys.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.846
Could be a trap.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.171
It's not! Do you know what it was like
to have a Nazi necromancer for a father?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.606
<i>It sucked!</i>

28:54.400 --> 28:58.121
Christmas was a joke.
Career day at school was a nightmare.

28:59.480 --> 29:02.962
All I did was try and make him proud,
I'll never be good enough.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.487
He asked a guy named Fritz to kill me.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.771
Okay, well, there's that.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.806
We'll hear you out. Where is she?

29:12.720 --> 29:13.801
I can take you to her.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.887
All right, you get the car,
I'll take care of the Kraut.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.606
All right.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.681
Go.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.321
The boy has some spine after all.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.286
I'll find him.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.568
Christoph's time will come.

29:34.720 --> 29:39.044
For now, we have more important business.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.202
He always loved this one.

29:52.880 --> 29:58.250
Wagner. It's the perfect way
to ease the FÃ¼hrer into this new century.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.405
She is prepared.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.721
- All right.
- Hey. What are you doing?

30:30.960 --> 30:32.849
- Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?
- Yeah, pretty much.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.162
What? Hey!

30:36.640 --> 30:37.766
Hey!

30:43.800 --> 30:46.451
All right, we got two outside
and who knows how many inside.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.687
- Great.
- Oh...

30:53.600 --> 30:54.601
No.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.369
- Why?
- Dean, we need to be stealth.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.886
Do this quietly.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.046
Dean?

31:02.080 --> 31:05.926
Dean. We'll get a chance. It's okay.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.924
Let's go kill some Nazis.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.929
What are you doing to me?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.085
The <i>FÃ¼hrer's</i> soul

31:39.120 --> 31:43.648
must occupy a body
that contains the blood of his blood.

31:47.200 --> 31:52.684
Did you really think I would resurrect
the greatest man who ever lived

31:54.360 --> 31:56.840
in the body of a weak,

31:57.600 --> 32:00.524
<i>unworthy American female?</i>

32:02.520 --> 32:03.681
My God.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.284
I never needed you,

32:09.840 --> 32:11.251
<i>only your blood.</i>

32:56.680 --> 32:57.806
Ready.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.886
Hitler?

34:02.600 --> 34:03.681
Hans!

34:15.080 --> 34:16.081
Whew!

34:16.960 --> 34:18.324
Wolfgang!

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
Oh...

34:45.679 --> 34:46.681
Gottfried!

35:01.160 --> 35:03.686
This can't be happening.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.326
My great,

35:08.960 --> 35:11.247
great grandniece.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.849
Thank you for the gift, <i>Liebchen.</i>

35:25.240 --> 35:26.924
What shall we do with her, FÃ¼hrer?

35:29.880 --> 35:33.009
Take the rest of her blood.
Then give her to the dogs.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.806
- But, FÃ¼hrer, we have no dogs.
- Then get some!

35:38.680 --> 35:39.966
I love doggies.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.326
Woof, woof, woof.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.801
<i>Los geht's.</i> Come on.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.562
Should have just brought
the grenade launcher.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.803
Admit it, though, you're having fun.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.171
Yeah, so much fun.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.045
Well, if it isn't father of the year.

One of many upgrades I'm enjoying.
Like this!

36:54.240 --> 36:56.811
It's like having a tiny Goebbels
in my pocket!

37:00.360 --> 37:03.011
I sold 10 million copies of <i>Mein Kampf,</i>

37:03.280 --> 37:05.328
what do you think I can do with Twitter?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.649

37:12.400 --> 37:13.811
Almost ready, FÃ¼hrer.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.481
Good.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.327
What shall we do with them?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.370
Take them with us.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.888
I shall very much
enjoy introducing them to my new dogs.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.123
No. Wait, wait...

37:43.720 --> 37:46.041
No! I can explain.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.851

38:07.360 --> 38:08.441

38:10.040 --> 38:13.089
- You killed Hitler.
- Yeah.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.561
Awesome.

38:30.800 --> 38:31.881
I killed Hitler.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.241
I killed Hitler.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.361
I killed Hitler.
I think that entitles me to free drinks

38:37.560 --> 38:39.722
for the rest of my life.
I'm gonna get T-shirts made.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.689
You know no one's
gonna believe you, right?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.922
Well, you believe me. You were there.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.691
All right, let's go.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.928
Hold up, you're not gonna kill me?

38:53.160 --> 38:55.447
No, we had a deal.
Besides, you got bigger problems.

38:55.680 --> 38:59.207
The Thule that are left
are gonna hunt you as a traitor forever.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.606
Our advice?

39:02.080 --> 39:03.161
Run.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.762
Why don't you head back to Buffalo?
Nobody goes to Buffalo.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.245
So how you holding up?

39:25.960 --> 39:29.885
Ah, well, we just burned
a pile of dead Nazi zombie bodies,

39:30.120 --> 39:33.488
one of which I killed,
so maybe like third-worst day ever.

39:34.280 --> 39:38.126
- I had a rough time lately.
- Yeah, and then all this happens.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.964
I think I'm gonna be okay, though.
I should probably call my mom.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.766
You can only run for so long, you know?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.889
So, uh, what do you think is harder?

39:49.120 --> 39:52.408
Facing the reincarnation of Hitler
or going back to med school?

39:53.640 --> 39:57.850
- I think I gotta say Hitler.
- Yeah, I think, I think so.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.685
Thank you for everything.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.326
Yeah, uh...

40:02.480 --> 40:03.606
Take care of yourself.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.487
Yeah.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.921
Good to go.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.010
You know, I was thinking...

40:26.400 --> 40:27.811
Passed a bakery on the way into town.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.685
Sign said,
"Best pie for a thousand miles."

40:32.960 --> 40:34.928
So, now you want pie?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.687
I killed Hitler.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.045
I think I deserve some pie.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.684
Did I mention I killed Hitler?

40:49.120 --> 40:51.043
SAM: I'm never gonna hear the end of this,
am I?

40:51.320 --> 40:52.651
DEAN: Probably not.
