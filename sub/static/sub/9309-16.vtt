- I was up late last night.
- Working or dating?

Working ... on a poem
for my writing class.

- Well, it isn't.

sticking garlic in your ear

03:50.385 --> 03:53.019
Oh, so our killer was hit, too.

03:53.054 --> 03:55.188
I put out a BOLO to all
the hospital emergency rooms

03:55.223 --> 03:57.223
to report anybody coming in
with a gunshot wound.

03:57.258 --> 04:00.326
Okay.
Looks like he went this way.

04:00.361 --> 04:01.928
You're right.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.729
Uh, the cashier at the corner
store didn't see anything,

04:03.765 --> 04:05.565
but I checked
the security camera,

04:05.600 --> 04:07.166
and it captures
a young white guy

04:07.202 --> 04:08.968
with a gun
running over that way.

04:09.003 --> 04:12.004
- And the time matches.
- We'll get that video to Nina.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.172
Maybe she can pull a clear shot
of the guy's face.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.941
Yeah.

04:14.976 --> 04:16.676
Let's get a photo of the victim
over to the gang unit,

04:16.711 --> 04:17.677
see if he's got any connections
to organized crime.

04:17.712 --> 04:18.644
Yep.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.381
- That's a big boy.
- What's that?

04:22.417 --> 04:24.784
What can you tell us?

04:24.819 --> 04:26.953
Oh, our victim seems to have
been brought down

04:26.988 --> 04:28.354
by a small-caliber bullet.

04:28.389 --> 04:31.891
Had to be a perfect shot
to drop such a big guy.

- Why are you yelling?!
- Because you put fruit in your ears!

and my sinuses are cleared.

04:53.281 --> 04:55.014

Really? Seriously?

04:55.049 --> 04:56.115

04:56.150 --> 04:57.683
- Like a wonder drug.
- All right.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.352
So, our victim was killed

04:59.387 --> 05:03.022
by a single .22-caliber
gunshot wound to the heart.

05:03.057 --> 05:06.659
Shotspotter said that his .45
fired the first 2 shots.

05:06.694 --> 05:09.195
So the victim was the aggressor.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.364
It appears that the other guy
was reacting in self-defense,

05:11.399 --> 05:13.700
but, you know, who knows
what happened before they

05:13.701 --> 05:16.002

05:16.037 --> 05:18.170
<i>Are you any closer to I.D.'ing him?</i>

05:18.206 --> 05:21.240
No. We ran his prints through
AFIS and didn't get a hit.

05:21.276 --> 05:23.109
And what about the victim's gun?

05:23.144 --> 05:25.978
Stolen from a gun store
in Southie six months ago.

05:26.014 --> 05:29.115
Did you find anything that could
tell us where he came from?

05:29.150 --> 05:31.117
Well, I've gone through
his clothes,

05:31.152 --> 05:34.387
but there is nothing distinctive
or unusual.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.155
What about his boots?

05:36.190 --> 05:39.992
His boots ... we found dirt, oil,

05:40.028 --> 05:42.895
gum,
bird droppings,

05:42.931 --> 05:45.431
and tomato sauce with sugar ...
possibly pizza ...

05:45.466 --> 05:48.200
- on the soles.
- Well, that's fantastic.

05:48.236 --> 05:50.937
He could be from any
neighborhood in Boston.

05:50.972 --> 05:53.906
[chuckles] I did remove
a small piece of metal

05:53.942 --> 05:55.841
with a plastic coating
from the boot.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.044
We'll run some tests and see
if we can determine its origin.

05:58.079 --> 06:01.080
All right. Well, anything
you can find will help

to the neighborhood?

06:57.505 --> 07:00.306
He needs to relax so I can make
money, you understand?

07:00.341 --> 07:02.908
Uh, people say that he's your son.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.144
I don't have son, okay?
I've answered your questions.

07:05.179 --> 07:06.912

for his massage,

07:06.948 --> 07:08.247
no more questions.

down at the station,

got her citizenship,
and then hit a rough patch.

Uh, but she had several arrests
for prostitution and petty theft,

08:03.909 --> 08:05.676

she did a short prison stint.

Did the gang unit respond to it?

08:24.630 --> 08:26.663
Uh, they've never seen the guy.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.466

08:33.472 --> 08:36.373
I noticed an unusual node
on the victim's thyroid.

08:36.408 --> 08:40.477
We tested it and found high levels
of radioactive iodine present.

08:40.513 --> 08:44.414
- Okay.
- An analysis revealed radioisotope I-29,

08:44.450 --> 08:46.550
which is a by-product
of nuclear fission

08:46.585 --> 08:49.686
and has no medical purpose
like I-123,

08:49.722 --> 08:52.523
- I-124, I-131 ...
- Maura.

08:52.558 --> 08:55.425
Okay.
It is a kind of radioisotope

08:55.461 --> 08:58.695
that was common after Chernobyl.
[door opens]

09:10.042 --> 09:12.476
Now, although nothing
was officially reported,

09:12.511 --> 09:15.679
scientists do believe that it
was a nuclear-reactor accident.

09:15.714 --> 09:21.385
So it's possible that he was
from Baldone, Latvia?

09:23.255 --> 09:24.221
- Yes.
- Yes.

- Mm. Yes, I'm just a... a little tired.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.735
- Yeah, you do look exhausted.
- Oh.

09:38.771 --> 09:40.304
Maybe you should go home and rest.

09:40.339 --> 09:42.139
I've got too much to do.

09:42.174 --> 09:45.809
Kent. Didn't we talk
about personal space

09:45.844 --> 09:47.477
and professional behavior?
[sighs]

09:47.513 --> 09:49.813
Yes, and I'm just
taking your temperature.

09:49.848 --> 09:52.382
And you have a fever.
Ibuprofen?

09:52.418 --> 09:55.519
Allergic. I really don't
have time to be sick, anyway.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.521
You know,

09:59.658 --> 10:01.291
Yeah, you do have a fever,

10:01.327 --> 10:03.293
but it doesn't have to hold you
back for very long.

10:03.329 --> 10:07.231
- You know what the Bedouins say.
- It's a dry heat?

10:07.266 --> 10:09.833
N-No.
"Have a fever, light a fire."

10:09.868 --> 10:13.170
- What does that mean?
- Ah.

10:13.205 --> 10:14.705
Now, how would you like
to try something

10:14.740 --> 10:16.206

10:16.242 --> 10:19.643

Oh, did you recognize our shooter?

10:28.187 --> 10:30.787
Yeah, kid was hanging around
with the Quint Street Boys.

10:30.823 --> 10:32.389
Can you I.D. him?

10:32.424 --> 10:34.224
Well, right now we just have
a nickname for him here.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.159
He goes by "Little Nicky"
on the street.

10:36.195 --> 10:38.362
- Yeah.
- Looks like he got involved

10:38.397 --> 10:40.864
with the gang earlier in the year.
Then, a couple of months ago,

10:40.899 --> 10:42.366
he had a falling-out with them,
and he disappeared.

10:42.401 --> 10:43.634
We figured he either fled
or he was dead.

10:43.669 --> 10:45.135
Well, what was
the falling-out about?

10:45.170 --> 10:46.336
I don't know.
Could've made a grab for power,

10:46.372 --> 10:47.704
insulted somebody's girlfriend,

10:47.740 --> 10:50.574
or took the last stick of gum.
Yeah, usual crap.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.609
All right, I'm gonna need photos

10:52.645 --> 10:55.279
and background files
on all the gang leaders.

10:55.314 --> 10:56.713
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great.

10:58.984 --> 11:02.486
Agris Vilks, boss of
the Quint Street Boys.

11:02.521 --> 11:05.155
- Nice scar.
- Oh, they're ruthless.

11:05.190 --> 11:08.592
Into the usual things ...
drugs, prostitution, gambling.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.861
But they've done a good job
laundering their money

11:10.896 --> 11:12.829
through legit businesses
like junkyards,

11:12.865 --> 11:16.133
- construction, auto-repair shops.
- Anything blue-collar.

11:16.168 --> 11:18.535
Yeah. They like to fit in
and fly under the radar.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.904
Interpol got a hit on the
victim's fingerprints in Latvia.

11:20.939 --> 11:22.572
His name is Egon Kronis.

11:22.608 --> 11:24.274
They believe he's a hit man
for the Latvian mob.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.876
So Nicky has a fallout
with the gang,

11:25.911 --> 11:28.312
and they bring in a pro
from Latvia to take him out?

11:28.347 --> 11:31.181
- They wanted the kid dead real bad.
- And they wanted it done right.

11:31.216 --> 11:33.183
<i>Nina: When Frankie told me
about Nicky,</i>

11:33.218 --> 11:35.786
I dug a little deeper into
Katrin's background in Latvia.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.221
She had a sister there who
passed away about a year ago,

11:38.257 --> 11:40.724
and she had a son named
Nicholas Bartulis.

11:40.759 --> 11:43.660
- That's little Nicky.
- Yep, and he entered the country

11:43.696 --> 11:45.462
on a tourist visa about a year ago.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.897
So Katrin didn't have her son
living with her.

11:46.932 --> 11:48.699
It was her nephew.

11:48.734 --> 11:50.400
And if Nicky's hurt and all of
his friends are after him,

11:50.436 --> 11:51.702
there's only one place
that he would turn for help.

11:51.737 --> 11:53.737
Good old Aunt Katrin.

11:53.772 --> 11:55.605
No, we have uniforms all over
that neighborhood.

11:55.641 --> 11:56.473
No one's seen Nicky.

11:56.508 --> 12:00.811
- Okay, pull 'em off.
- Why?

12:00.846 --> 12:02.379
Because we want Nicky to think

12:02.414 --> 12:03.847
it's finally safe to go back
to Katrin's place.

12:03.882 --> 12:06.350
Yeah, and I want to be there
for that happy reunion.

12:10.422 --> 12:11.722
I'm gonna take a little walk,

12:11.757 --> 12:13.490
make sure none of
our Quint Street pals

12:13.525 --> 12:14.925
are waiting around for Nicky.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.860
Last thing we need is another
shootout in the streets.

12:16.895 --> 12:19.381
Okay.
[cellphone beeps]

12:20.432 --> 12:22.299
Hey.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.234
Is anyone letting you use their
apartment to watch the alley?

12:24.269 --> 12:26.570
I've had three nos,
two doors slammed in my face,

12:26.605 --> 12:28.205
and a place with so many cats

12:28.240 --> 12:30.340
it looked like an animal shelter
on steroids.

12:30.376 --> 12:31.942
<i>Well, at least there's no spiders.</i>

12:31.977 --> 12:35.512
Really?
You had to mention spiders?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.948
I'm not done yet.
[cellphone beeps]

12:37.983 --> 12:39.049
[sighs]

12:43.055 --> 12:45.355
[music]

12:45.391 --> 12:48.625
Uh, uh, Detective Rizzoli,
Boston P.D.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.295
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I didn't say you did.

12:52.331 --> 12:54.798
In fact, I bet you never do
anything wrong.

12:54.833 --> 12:58.635
Real smooth. That work
for you with other women?

12:59.070 --> 13:02.205
No...
I don't know why I said that.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.941
- I'm not that guy.
- So who are you?

13:04.977 --> 13:08.478
Just a cop that really needs
some help?

13:09.314 --> 13:10.948
Hmm.

13:19.591 --> 13:23.393
Streets are clear. Only one
sitting on this building is us.

13:23.429 --> 13:26.430
Well, did you search all of Boston?
You've been gone for an hour.

13:26.465 --> 13:31.501
I had to find a restroom.
Stakeouts are hard on old guys.

13:31.537 --> 13:35.539
- Ohh, here we go.
- No, I'm not retiring.

13:35.574 --> 13:36.807
No, but you're thinking about it.

13:36.842 --> 13:40.010
- Well, you got to plan for the future.
- I plan!

13:40.045 --> 13:43.861
My plan is to stop your
plan of retiring. [laughs]

13:44.383 --> 13:50.487
So, Frankie, what's going on?
What are you looking for?

13:50.522 --> 13:52.055
Well, all I can really tell you

13:52.090 --> 13:55.392
is that I have to watch
that alleyway.

13:56.728 --> 13:58.361
Oh.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.764
Listen, if there's anything
you need to do,

14:00.799 --> 14:02.833
just... pretend
like I'm not here.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.968
Why would I want to do that?

14:05.003 --> 14:07.671
Well, I just don't want
to get in your way.

14:07.706 --> 14:09.906
You're not.

14:09.942 --> 14:13.810
So, you can't talk about your case.

14:13.846 --> 14:16.974
Can you talk about yourself?

14:19.351 --> 14:20.550
[sighs]

14:20.586 --> 14:23.487
[music]

14:23.522 --> 14:24.754
[sighs]

14:24.790 --> 14:30.327
- Okay, weirdest traffic stop ever.
- Oh. That's easy.

14:30.362 --> 14:31.928
I was patrolling
the university district

14:31.964 --> 14:33.630
- right after the bars closed.
- Mm.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.067
Me and my partner see this car.
It's driving real slow

14:37.102 --> 14:39.703
and weaving in and out of its lane and...
[car door closes]

14:39.738 --> 14:43.507
I need a plate check ...
13 November Fred 68.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.676
Thanks. Okay. Carful of
drunk fraternity kids ...

14:46.712 --> 14:48.078
that doesn't sound that bad.

14:48.113 --> 14:49.913
Yeah, well,
that's what I thought.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.681
So we pull the car over,
and sure enough,

14:51.717 --> 14:53.817
it's filled with hammered
frat boys.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.685
But it's not a drunk-driving stop,

14:55.721 --> 14:58.955
because the driver
isn't drunk ... he's blind.

14:58.991 --> 15:01.391
Well, what did you do?!

15:01.426 --> 15:03.093
Well, I yanked
the one frat boy out

15:03.128 --> 15:06.796
who could still put together
a sentence, and he said, "well,

15:06.832 --> 15:08.832
we knew we were too drunk
to drive, officer,

15:08.867 --> 15:10.367
but we didn't really know

15:10.402 --> 15:12.636
how we were gonna get back
to the animal house."

15:12.671 --> 15:14.971
Then they spot this old
blind guy at a bus stop.

15:15.007 --> 15:17.107
They pay him to drive them
back [chuckles]

15:17.142 --> 15:19.142
while they direct him
which way to go.

15:19.177 --> 15:21.945
- No.
- They thought, "well, you know,

15:21.980 --> 15:23.513
we'll get back safe, and we'll
have a great story to tell."

15:23.549 --> 15:26.149
What they didn't count on was that
story would end in a jail cell.

15:26.184 --> 15:29.085
How have I not heard this one?

15:29.121 --> 15:32.689
Oh, I've still got a few gems
in the old trunk.

15:34.993 --> 15:37.894
I'm gonna miss this when it's over.

15:39.665 --> 15:43.199
Me too, kid. Me too.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.928
[music]

15:51.796 --> 15:53.396
Hi. How you doing?

15:53.631 --> 15:56.032
In a word ... feverish.

15:56.067 --> 15:58.935
Is this another one of
my mother's crazy cures?

15:58.970 --> 16:02.839
- No, it's Kent's Bedouin remedy.
- Oh, even better.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.759
We've identified the scrap
of metal that I found in

16:05.760 --> 16:08.644
the victim's boot, and it's
definitely from a car part.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.914
- Uh, we're working to I.D. a model.
- Okay, good.

16:11.950 --> 16:13.850
If we can find Nicky
and get him to help us,

16:13.885 --> 16:15.918
then we're gonna need
the physical evidence

16:15.954 --> 16:17.753
to tie the hit man
to the mob boss.

16:17.789 --> 16:20.022
All right.
We'll stay on it.

16:20.058 --> 16:21.757
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

16:21.793 --> 16:26.195
And... good luck with the
Bedouins. [cellphone beeps]

16:26.491 --> 16:28.324
Ugh. Okay.

16:28.359 --> 16:30.659
So, where are we
with the piece of metal

16:30.695 --> 16:33.062
that I pulled from
the victim's boot?

16:33.097 --> 16:34.630
It's in the gas-chromatography
machine.

16:34.665 --> 16:37.133
We should have the results back
in about half an hour.

16:37.168 --> 16:41.604
- Can you please get my notebook for me?
- Uh-huh.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.206
And what kind of creative
writing are we doing?

16:44.242 --> 16:48.344
Ohh, this week's assignment
is writing a poem

16:48.379 --> 16:52.615
- titled "The opposite of me."
- Sounds interesting.

16:52.650 --> 16:55.117
It might be if I understood
what the professor wanted.

16:55.153 --> 16:57.219
But he's being purposefully vague.

16:57.255 --> 16:58.721
Well, maybe he's being vague

16:58.756 --> 17:00.956
'cause he wants you to think
about the title creatively.

17:00.992 --> 17:02.992
You see, that's the beautiful
thing about poetry ...

17:03.027 --> 17:06.996
it's not contained by any
traditional form or structure.

17:07.031 --> 17:08.430
But I love structure.

17:08.465 --> 17:10.165
Yeah, then this is the perfect
assignment for you.

17:10.201 --> 17:12.067
It's gonna make you think
outside the box.

17:12.103 --> 17:14.670
Maybe it would be easier
if I felt better.

17:14.704 --> 17:17.540
Well, don't you worry. I'll take
care of everything in the lab.

17:17.575 --> 17:20.342
All you have to do
is lie back under the covers,

17:20.377 --> 17:22.377
open your pores, relax your mind,

17:22.413 --> 17:25.347
- and let your imagination flow.
- Mm.

17:25.383 --> 17:28.918
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

17:28.953 --> 17:31.687
[music]

17:34.392 --> 17:38.227
- All right, what are you doing there?
- Just sketching you.

17:38.262 --> 17:41.363
- Really? Can I see it?
- No.

17:41.599 --> 17:45.367
- It's not done yet.
- Ah. [chuckles]

17:45.403 --> 17:48.404
Anyone ever tell you that you
look like montgomery Clift?

17:48.439 --> 17:52.741
- No. Who's Montgomery Clift?
- A movie star from the '50s.

17:52.777 --> 17:56.545
- I don't really watch old movies.
- [sighs] I love old movies.

17:56.581 --> 18:00.282
And I love Montgomery Clift.
He was so handsome.

18:00.318 --> 18:02.685
[clears throat]

18:02.720 --> 18:07.523
- What do you like to do for fun?
- I love the Red Sox.

18:07.558 --> 18:09.091
I don't know much
about baseball.

18:09.126 --> 18:11.393
You can't live in this town
and not love The Sox.

18:11.429 --> 18:13.128
So tell me about them.

18:13.164 --> 18:15.598
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.633 --> 18:20.002
Okay, the story begins
december 26, 1919.

18:20.037 --> 18:23.539
<i>That's when the Red Sox
traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees.</i>

18:23.574 --> 18:27.610
[music]

18:27.645 --> 18:30.179
Maura said that
she would move to Maine

18:30.214 --> 18:33.382
- and write mystery novels.
- You are avoiding the question.

18:33.417 --> 18:36.652
- I'm asking where you see yourself.
- I don't know.

18:36.687 --> 18:38.187
Probably right here
doing the same thing,

18:38.222 --> 18:39.655
just with a different partner.

18:39.690 --> 18:43.559
- What about a family?
- I couldn't give up being a cop,

18:43.594 --> 18:45.728
and I never figured out
how to have both, so...

18:45.763 --> 18:50.132
- Job takes a toll.
- But I wouldn't change a thing.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.500
I love being a cop.

18:51.535 --> 18:55.204
Find a job you love, you
never work a day in your life.

18:55.239 --> 18:58.073
- And they pay us!
- Can you believe it?

18:58.109 --> 19:01.477
[both laugh]
[music]

19:04.115 --> 19:06.315
[sighs]

19:10.388 --> 19:14.592
[sighs]
[music]

19:33.644 --> 19:36.111
[music]

19:55.299 --> 19:57.499
<i>Jane: What'd you get
on that piece of metal?</i>

19:57.535 --> 20:00.803
<i>Maura: I think it's a scrap from
the interior of an automobile.</i>

20:00.838 --> 20:03.806
The plastic is consistent with a
wide variety of domestic vehicles.

20:03.841 --> 20:06.675
- Well, that's not enough.
- There was also a speck of road tar.

20:06.711 --> 20:08.277
There had to have been more
trace evidence.

20:08.312 --> 20:11.497
Well, why are you pushing me?

20:11.532 --> 20:12.815
Because you want me to.

20:12.850 --> 20:15.851
Look, I-I-I ran it under
an electron microscope.

20:15.886 --> 20:18.487
I-I bathed it in acid
and rinsed it in saline.

20:18.522 --> 20:22.191
- What about the mass spectrometer?
- Nothing!

20:22.226 --> 20:23.625
It's a jagged piece of metal

20:23.661 --> 20:25.694
that was violently ripped
from a vehicle.

20:25.730 --> 20:29.465
So, according to Newton's
third law of motion,

20:29.500 --> 20:31.333
there had to be something
transferred to the scrap

20:31.369 --> 20:34.870
- that will reveal where it came from.
- You sound like me.

20:34.905 --> 20:36.572
I am you.

20:36.607 --> 20:39.375
Think, Maura.
With that kind of impact,

20:39.410 --> 20:41.176
How can there be nothing
left behind

20:41.212 --> 20:42.578
on our little piece of metal?

20:42.613 --> 20:44.847
It was stuck to the bottom
of a boot

20:44.882 --> 20:46.482
and dragged all over the city.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.617
Whatever material was there

20:48.652 --> 20:51.320
was rubbed clean
simply by walking on it.

20:52.823 --> 20:56.358
You know what I admire most about you?

20:57.260 --> 20:59.661
You never give up.
[gasps]

20:59.697 --> 21:03.465
- Oh, my gosh. What are those?
- My boots.

21:03.501 --> 21:04.633
[footsteps approach]

21:04.668 --> 21:06.568
Do we need to follow up with...

21:06.604 --> 21:07.870
Why are you staring at me
like that?

21:07.905 --> 21:09.919
Your boots.

21:12.995 --> 21:16.632
You're one to talk.
[music]

21:16.667 --> 21:18.547
[screams] Nooo!

21:18.582 --> 21:21.550
[breathing heavily]

21:22.784 --> 21:24.549
The boots.

21:28.883 --> 21:31.545
[music]

21:33.083 --> 21:34.282
[cellphone beeps]

21:34.317 --> 21:36.951
Hey.
How you feeling this morning?

21:36.986 --> 21:41.489
Except for a crazy dream last night,
I am back to my old self.

21:41.524 --> 21:42.957
Well, that's good news.

21:42.992 --> 21:46.360
- So, how you holding up out there?
- Uh, okay, I guess.

21:46.396 --> 21:48.196
I don't know.
Vince and I were talking

21:48.231 --> 21:51.966
about him retiring one day,
and it just got me thinking.

21:52.001 --> 21:53.901
I don't know.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.870
You think your life's
never gonna change,

21:55.905 --> 21:57.305
and then one day it just does.

21:57.340 --> 22:01.843
- Well, it's the nature of things.
- [sighs] Yeah.

22:01.878 --> 22:04.245
And then I realized that,
one day,

22:04.280 --> 22:06.481
you're gonna tell me
that you're gonna move

22:06.516 --> 22:10.818
to some podunk town in Maine
and write novels.

22:10.854 --> 22:13.421
Well, I hope I get to tell you
that one day.

22:15.325 --> 22:19.127
- Well, I'll miss you.
- No, you won't.

22:19.162 --> 22:21.613
You won't have a chance
because I'm either taking

22:21.614 --> 22:24.065
you with me or you're
going to visit all the time.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.333
Okay, but can you make sure

22:25.368 --> 22:27.101
you get a place with a basketball court?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.436
[chuckling] Jane.

22:28.471 --> 22:30.573
[door opens]

22:31.274 --> 22:33.374
I got to go, Maura.
[cellphone beeps]

22:35.411 --> 22:37.578
Hey. Psst! Wake up.

22:37.614 --> 22:39.113
Look at this.

22:41.184 --> 22:45.075
- Where's she going so early?
- Well, hopefully,

22:45.192 --> 22:47.421
if we're lucky,
she's gonna lead us to Nicky.

22:47.457 --> 22:49.557
[engine turns over]

22:49.592 --> 22:53.144
[music]

22:57.567 --> 22:59.200
[brakes squeal]

23:02.272 --> 23:04.405
Okay.
I want to keep eyes on her.

23:14.350 --> 23:15.583
[door closes]

23:15.618 --> 23:18.486
<i>Korsak.
She's not in here.</i>

23:32.202 --> 23:34.368
[sighs]

23:34.404 --> 23:36.370
Shit!

23:39.008 --> 23:40.241
[footsteps approach]

23:42.145 --> 23:45.146
- Ah. You look chipper.
- Yes!

23:45.181 --> 23:48.082
I had a wild dream last night
that was so vivid,

23:48.117 --> 23:50.351
but I woke up feeling refreshed.

23:50.386 --> 23:53.454
Ah, fever dreams and hallucinations
are common side effects.

23:53.489 --> 23:55.523
Well, this side effect
may have helped the case.

23:57.994 --> 24:00.628
I do hope that you're not
still hallucinating,

24:00.663 --> 24:05.533
as you seem to be performing
an autopsy on... well... a boot.

24:05.568 --> 24:09.570
- Can you hand me a swab?
- I already swabbed the sole,

24:09.606 --> 24:11.906
but didn't find anything unusual.

24:11.941 --> 24:16.177
- Yes, but did you look inside the sole?
- [sighs] No.

24:18.214 --> 24:20.448
I'm looking for
trace particle transfer

24:20.483 --> 24:22.483
from the piece of metal
to the sole,

24:22.518 --> 24:25.319
something that was left behind
in the plastic.

24:25.355 --> 24:30.625
Yeah.
A brown oily substance.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.693
That's why you're the boss.

24:32.729 --> 24:35.229
- Can you run an analysis?
- Absolutely.

24:35.265 --> 24:36.964
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:41.437 --> 24:43.070
I hope your fever dream
was inspiration

24:43.106 --> 24:45.006
for your writing as much
as it was for your work.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.407
Well, let's just say

24:46.442 --> 24:49.477
that I've turned
to the classics for inspiration.

24:49.512 --> 24:53.281
Ah. The classics.
Can't go wrong with the classics.

24:53.316 --> 24:55.249
[door opens]

24:55.285 --> 24:57.652
We've got several patrol cars
in the area. Nobody's seen her.

24:57.687 --> 24:59.120
The shop owner said
that she walked in

24:59.155 --> 25:00.254
and asked where
the bathroom was.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.989
[cellphone rings, beeps]

25:02.025 --> 25:03.591
Korsak.
[sighs]

25:03.626 --> 25:06.327
You got an address?

25:06.362 --> 25:08.596
Nice work.
[cellphone beeps]

25:08.631 --> 25:10.231
Nina flagged Katrin's accounts.

25:10.266 --> 25:12.697
She just used an ATM card
at a bank three blocks away.

25:18.874 --> 25:21.509
I'll check the ATM.

25:21.544 --> 25:23.277
Yeah, I got the other side.

25:26.121 --> 25:29.041
[music]

25:30.320 --> 25:32.119
[indistinct conversations]

25:39.095 --> 25:40.561
[door rattling]

25:43.232 --> 25:45.499
How can we have missed her?
She was just here. [cellphone vibrates]

25:45.535 --> 25:46.734
[cellphone beeps]

25:46.769 --> 25:48.502
Yeah.

25:48.538 --> 25:50.104
What? When?

25:51.307 --> 25:53.307
All right, just ...
just sit tight.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.775
[cellphone beeps]
It was Frankie.

25:54.811 --> 25:56.277
He said he just saw Katrin
go into her apartment.

25:56.312 --> 25:57.378
How'd she get home so fast?

25:57.413 --> 25:59.747
She must have dumped
the cash card

25:59.782 --> 26:02.783
- to Nicky when we lost her.
- But why here?

26:02.819 --> 26:05.286
There's a bank a block
from her apartment.

26:05.321 --> 26:08.356
Maybe he couldn't get
treatment without any cash.

26:10.526 --> 26:13.326
You think he'd take a hostage?

26:16.733 --> 26:18.499
[door opens]

26:23.606 --> 26:25.272
[door closes]

26:44.727 --> 26:48.022
[speaking Latvian]

27:03.283 --> 27:05.883
[music]

27:14.561 --> 27:17.395
You're in a tough spot, Nicky.

27:17.430 --> 27:20.632
We can prove that you shot
and killed Egon Kronis.

27:20.667 --> 27:21.866
No, but you don't understand.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.434
We understand
that you're involved

27:23.470 --> 27:24.569
with the Quint Street Boys.

27:24.604 --> 27:26.622
We have your blood at
the scene, and we have

27:26.623 --> 27:28.640
security video of you
running away with a gun.

27:28.675 --> 27:30.675
That's enough to put you away for life.

27:30.710 --> 27:33.611
Unless... you'd like to talk
about the gang.

27:33.647 --> 27:34.912
We know they wanted you dead.

27:34.948 --> 27:35.947
We know they sent a hit man to do it.

27:37.550 --> 27:43.388
- What we don't know is why.
- Well, how can I trust you?

27:43.423 --> 27:45.823
[sighs]

27:45.859 --> 27:47.992
How can you not?

27:48.028 --> 27:51.396
If you give us real info
on the gang's criminal activity,

27:51.431 --> 27:53.865
we can see to it that you only
do six months

27:53.900 --> 27:55.933
for unlawful possession of a gun.

27:55.969 --> 27:58.336
And we can put you into witness
protection when you get out.

27:58.371 --> 28:02.373
- What about my aunt?
- Her too.

28:05.478 --> 28:06.644
[sighs]

28:09.883 --> 28:12.984
I-I know who orders the murders.

28:13.019 --> 28:16.521
And I know how they get rid
of the bodies.

28:16.556 --> 28:18.956
If you're willing to testify,
we can make a deal.

28:18.992 --> 28:20.024
[knock on door]

28:22.595 --> 28:26.564
- I'm Nicky's lawyer.
- I don't have one.

28:26.599 --> 28:28.299
You do now.
I was hired by your Aunt Katrin.

28:28.335 --> 28:31.069
[whispers indistinctly]

28:33.640 --> 28:36.040
I've got nothing else to say to you.

28:40.613 --> 28:43.548
Testimony like his can take
down the Quint Street Boys.

28:43.583 --> 28:46.384
How do we get him to trust us
once he's lawyered up?

28:47.854 --> 28:50.655
Go to the one person he trusts.

28:55.462 --> 28:57.462
I just got
the preliminary results back

28:57.497 --> 28:59.931
from the particles lifted
from the sole of the boot.

28:59.966 --> 29:01.399
Anything interesting?

29:01.434 --> 29:03.534
Well, there's
a petroleum-based substance ...

29:03.570 --> 29:05.470
possibly hydraulic or brake fluid.

29:05.505 --> 29:08.606
Hmm.
Well, I need to know specifically

29:08.641 --> 29:11.008
what kind of lubricant it is
and where it's used.

29:11.044 --> 29:14.746
I've already started running
another analysis.

29:16.816 --> 29:19.917
"The opposite of me
as far as I can tell

29:19.953 --> 29:23.388
does stir the mind to search
one's world

29:23.423 --> 29:27.658
with passion and strength
from the heart's purest well."

29:28.895 --> 29:31.662
So?
What do you think?

29:31.698 --> 29:34.766
- Well, mathematically, it's perfect.
- I know!

29:34.801 --> 29:37.902
A sonnet, three quatrains,
alternating rhyme,

29:37.937 --> 29:40.905
- and a couplet in iambic pentameter.
- Yes. Yes, exactly!

29:40.940 --> 29:44.842
- And it's dreadful.
- [sighs] I know.

29:44.878 --> 29:46.878
You're overthinking
the whole thing, Maura.

29:49.616 --> 29:52.984
"This little song,
how can it be

29:53.019 --> 29:55.586
that it can mean so much to me?

29:55.622 --> 29:58.189
What is it then revealing?

29:58.224 --> 30:00.591
It holds a breath of melody,

30:00.627 --> 30:03.628
a touch of gentle harmony,

30:03.663 --> 30:05.596
and the soul of tender feeling."

30:05.632 --> 30:07.198
That's lovely.

30:07.233 --> 30:10.101
- And it's so simple.
- Exactly.

30:10.136 --> 30:12.937
You see, great poets, they write
simply and from the heart.

30:12.972 --> 30:16.774
So you must take your view
in the world [sighs]

30:16.810 --> 30:19.177
and let your heart write it, Maura.

30:27.554 --> 30:31.522
Hey, Vince.
Can I ask you something... personal?

30:31.558 --> 30:33.758
I guess so.

30:33.793 --> 30:37.895
- You and Kiki seem very different.
- We are.

30:37.931 --> 30:39.197
Did you ever have second thoughts
about her because of that?

30:39.232 --> 30:43.534
- Not once.
- Well, I just met a girl,

30:43.570 --> 30:45.837
and she's very different from me.

30:45.872 --> 30:48.072
- Different how?
- She's an artist...

30:48.107 --> 30:52.276
and a grad student.
Loves old movies.

30:52.312 --> 30:54.579
And she doesn't know anything
about The Sox.

30:54.614 --> 30:56.647
Anybody can learn about baseball.
Do you like her?

30:56.683 --> 31:00.117
- Yeah, I do.
- Then what's wrong with different?

31:00.153 --> 31:03.955
- Different is interesting, exciting.
Yeah?

31:03.990 --> 31:05.923
<i>Yeah.
[chuckles]</i>

31:08.995 --> 31:12.763
- You can't walk into my place.
- I just did.

31:12.799 --> 31:15.733
- I have rights.
- Call the cops.

31:15.768 --> 31:18.169
[sighs]

31:19.539 --> 31:22.740
- What do you want?
- Your help.

31:24.143 --> 31:27.111
I'm pretty sure that Nicky acted
in self-defense.

31:27.146 --> 31:30.681
But if he does not cooperate
with us, he's going to jail.

31:30.717 --> 31:33.117
And if the gang wants him dead
on the street,

31:33.152 --> 31:35.987
they will find someone who
will kill him in prison.

31:38.258 --> 31:41.025
- This is all my fault.
- Why do you say that?

31:41.060 --> 31:43.127
'Cause I brought him here
for better life.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.297
Look what happened.
I should've known better.

31:46.332 --> 31:49.066
You cannot make it here
without connections,

31:49.102 --> 31:52.570
- without education.
- You did.

31:52.605 --> 31:55.206
You made a life for yourself
playing by the rules.

31:56.643 --> 31:58.643
I know all about you, Katrin.

31:58.678 --> 32:02.914
I know about your past.
I know about your sister.

32:02.949 --> 32:04.849
I know that you brought Nicky
here to help him,

32:04.884 --> 32:07.585
and you can still do that.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.854
You're just gonna have to trust us.

32:16.296 --> 32:18.596
Tell me about Nicky and the gang.

32:18.631 --> 32:23.267
[sighs] He came here.
He couldn't find a job.

32:23.303 --> 32:26.270
So he sees all these men
with cars, with money ...

32:26.306 --> 32:29.607
you know ... in the gang,
and he want these things.

32:29.642 --> 32:32.276
So he gets involved with people
who promise to get him money.

32:32.312 --> 32:34.712
So, why do they want to kill him?

32:34.747 --> 32:36.914
He does some stealing for the gang.

32:36.950 --> 32:39.116
And he's good, you know?
He's loyal.

32:39.152 --> 32:41.052
So they want him in the gang.

32:41.087 --> 32:45.790
But he has to prove himself.
So they gave him a gun.

32:45.825 --> 32:47.959
And they told him to kill a man

32:47.994 --> 32:51.896
- and where to dump the body.
- And he couldn't do it.

32:51.931 --> 32:56.334
He's not a killer.
He's not bad like that.

32:56.369 --> 32:58.369
He's made a big mistake.

32:58.404 --> 33:00.738
And there is only one way
out of this.

33:00.773 --> 33:02.373
He has to cooperate with us.

33:03.376 --> 33:07.645
- You gonna help him?
- Yes. I give you my word.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.615
[sighs]

33:10.650 --> 33:13.050
Okay.
I'm gonna talk to him.

33:13.086 --> 33:16.354
Okay. And then the next thing
you got to do,

33:16.389 --> 33:20.533
- you got to call off your lawyer.
- What lawyer?

33:20.628 --> 33:24.384
[music]

33:30.770 --> 33:32.770
When?

33:32.805 --> 33:34.839
All right.

33:34.874 --> 33:37.058
Lawyer convinced the
judge that since there were

33:37.059 --> 33:39.243
no witnesses and we didn't
find a murder weapon,

33:39.278 --> 33:41.679
Nicky may have just gotten
caught in the crossfire.

33:41.714 --> 33:45.149
- Bail?
- 100 grand.

33:45.184 --> 33:46.784
We got to get down there
before the gang does.

33:46.819 --> 33:48.019
He's already made bail.

33:48.054 --> 33:50.721
So they're gonna kill him.
Like you said.

33:50.757 --> 33:52.023
No. No, no, no.

33:52.058 --> 33:54.962
We're not gonna let
that happen, okay? Okay?

34:02.207 --> 34:04.894
If Nicky's still alive,
it's only because the gang

34:04.895 --> 34:07.012
wants to know what he told
us before his lawyer got here.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.714
Only question is,
how long can he hold out?

34:08.748 --> 34:10.014
And where they have him.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.483
Please tell me
you've got something.

34:11.518 --> 34:12.918
I came up with all the businesses

34:12.953 --> 34:14.920
and known addresses of
the Latvian crime boss.

34:14.955 --> 34:16.855
[cellphone vibrates] And we have
uniforms at all 13 locations...

34:16.891 --> 34:18.623
[cellphone beeps]
...but no sign of Nicky.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.458
Hey, Maura.
You're on speaker.

34:20.494 --> 34:21.741
<i>The oily substance</i>

34:21.742 --> 34:24.237
we found in the boot sole
is a type of high-viscosity

34:24.237 --> 34:26.732
hydraulic fluid with
a phosphorous additive.

34:26.766 --> 34:29.318
The additive is significant
because it's only used

34:29.319 --> 34:31.870
as a lubricant in high-pressure
industrial machinery.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.739
Like what?
Give me an example.

34:33.774 --> 34:37.708
Wind turbines, stone cutters,
aircraft hydraulics.

34:37.745 --> 34:41.880
Wait a second.
A scrap of metal from a car,

34:41.916 --> 34:44.049
fluid from
a high-pressure hydraulic ...

34:44.083 --> 34:45.784
what is that, a car crusher?

34:45.819 --> 34:46.885
They're powered
by a hydraulic pump

34:46.920 --> 34:48.520
and piston
under high pressure.

34:48.556 --> 34:50.121
We found one wrecking yard
owned by the crime boss.

34:50.157 --> 34:52.591
Uh, we checked.
There was no one there.

34:52.626 --> 34:55.438
Okay. Thanks, guys.
[cellphone beeps]

34:55.496 --> 34:57.863
[sighs] Okay.

34:57.898 --> 35:00.866
Pull up all the salvage yards
in the North end.

35:00.901 --> 35:06.405
Let me see a list of the Quint
Street Boys gang members. [beep]

35:08.776 --> 35:12.010
Look at the owner for
M&G Auto Salvage.

35:12.046 --> 35:13.011
- Mauris Fogel.
- Yep.

35:13.047 --> 35:16.782
Look at the third name
on the Quint Street Boys list.

35:16.817 --> 35:19.651
- Guntis Fogel.
- We got an "M" and a "G."

35:19.687 --> 35:21.720
And we have an address.

35:21.755 --> 35:24.389
[music]

35:24.425 --> 35:25.791
[grunts]

35:25.826 --> 35:27.426
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

35:27.461 --> 35:28.961
<i>Please, let me out!
Please!</i>

35:28.996 --> 35:30.896
<i>I promise, you don't have to do this!</i>

35:30.931 --> 35:32.631
<i>Please!</i>

35:32.666 --> 35:35.801
<i>No! Don't!</i>

35:35.836 --> 35:37.836
[machinery whirs]

35:40.507 --> 35:42.574
<i>[grunts]
Come on!</i>

35:50.818 --> 35:53.051
[gunfire]

35:58.626 --> 36:01.460
<i>Hey!
Hey, help!</i>

36:01.495 --> 36:03.195
[gunfire]

36:06.967 --> 36:10.669
<i>Hey, help! Please!
Help me!</i>

36:10.704 --> 36:12.704
[gunfire continues]

36:13.941 --> 36:16.608
<i>Hey! Help!
Help me, please!</i>

36:17.911 --> 36:19.378
- Please!
- Okay, okay.

36:19.413 --> 36:21.413
<i>The controls are over there!</i>

36:21.448 --> 36:22.080
Hang on!

36:22.116 --> 36:24.049
<i>Help! No!
I'm stuck!</i>

36:26.220 --> 36:28.120
[grunting]

36:28.188 --> 36:30.122
Hurry! Help!

36:48.609 --> 36:50.742
Nicky! Nicky?

36:52.780 --> 36:54.513
[both sigh]

36:54.548 --> 36:55.614
Are you okay?

36:55.649 --> 36:58.178
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

37:00.821 --> 37:03.855
[police radio chatter]

37:03.891 --> 37:05.891
<i>Nicky!</i>

37:10.164 --> 37:12.531
Tough lady's got a soft side.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.911
I know somebody just like her.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.741
[music]

37:24.178 --> 37:26.044
[sighs]

37:28.749 --> 37:32.217
- Hi.
- [chuckling] Hey.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.919
Uh, did you forget something?

37:33.954 --> 37:37.255
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, I forgot to ask

37:37.291 --> 37:38.924
if you want to go to
a baseball game with me.

37:38.959 --> 37:39.925
Yes!

37:39.960 --> 37:41.693
Great!

37:41.729 --> 37:43.729
Well, the ... the Sox are
playing the Yankees tonight, so...

37:43.764 --> 37:45.597
I know all about their rivalry...

37:45.632 --> 37:49.501
Going back to the Babe,
the sultan of swing.

37:49.536 --> 37:50.802
The king of swat...

37:50.838 --> 37:53.572
- You were listening.
- To every word.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.174
Oh! Wait.

37:56.210 --> 37:58.143
I [scoffs]
I can't go tonight.

37:58.178 --> 38:02.247
I promised a friend I'd be
at her art-gallery opening.

38:02.282 --> 38:07.519
- All right.
- Uh, would you want to come with me?

38:07.554 --> 38:09.855
[music]

38:09.890 --> 38:13.659
Uh... sure.
Yeah, I'd like that.

38:13.660 --> 38:15.127
That'd be different.

38:15.162 --> 38:18.029
How do you feel about
abstract expressionism?

38:18.065 --> 38:20.265
[clears throat]

38:20.300 --> 38:23.135
Well, my ...
my feelings are...

38:23.170 --> 38:27.973
abstract and hard to express.
[chuckles]

38:28.242 --> 38:31.209
[music]

38:31.245 --> 38:33.678
- Hello!
- Hello. What is that?

38:33.714 --> 38:35.881
This is my very own spa water.

38:35.916 --> 38:39.618
Cayenne, lemon, ginger,
mint, and chia seeds.

38:39.653 --> 38:43.121
- Chia seeds as in chia pet?
- Yes, actually. [chuckles]

38:43.157 --> 38:45.625
Wait, so if she drinks
that, is she gonna grow

38:45.626 --> 38:48.093
one of those
huge super-green afros?

38:48.128 --> 38:50.328
No, Jane. There'll be no
growing of green afros.

38:50.364 --> 38:52.697
She'll be sufficiently hydrated
with vitamins,

38:52.733 --> 38:55.066
and the chia seeds will provide
Omega-3 and 6,

38:55.102 --> 38:57.102
- potassium, and antioxidants.
- Hmm.

38:57.137 --> 38:58.603
Not even a little afro?

38:58.639 --> 39:00.272
[sneezes]

39:00.307 --> 39:03.008
[gasps] Oh, no. I hope you
didn't catch that from me.

39:03.043 --> 39:06.578
Oh, it's just my sinuses and
a little scratchy sore throat.

39:06.613 --> 39:08.046
Nope.

39:08.081 --> 39:10.182
First signs of a cold,
I like a good oxtail soup.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.784
I just use a little pepper oil
on my nostrils.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.920
Yeah, well, that's all
very good for your sinuses,

39:14.955 --> 39:16.154
but for a sore throat,

39:16.190 --> 39:17.722
the best thing is actually
snail mucus.

39:17.758 --> 39:19.658
[gags]
No, seriously.

39:19.693 --> 39:22.961
Snail goo is a most wonderful
natural expectorant.

39:22.996 --> 39:24.229
Thank you very much,

39:24.264 --> 39:26.598
but I'll just use
an onion-juice gargle.

39:26.633 --> 39:28.099
Okay! I ... Really?!

39:28.135 --> 39:32.103
I mean, with the snail goo
and the onion gargle?

39:32.139 --> 39:34.606
Can we just order a pizza, please?

39:34.641 --> 39:36.875
- Yes! A pizza sounds yummy.
- Ugh.

39:36.910 --> 39:38.276
I thought you had a writing class.

39:38.312 --> 39:40.812
Oh, I had to miss it.
I got hung up at work.

39:40.848 --> 39:46.017
Or did you skip it 'cause
little miss head of the class

39:46.053 --> 39:47.819
didn't finish her homework?
Hmm?

39:47.855 --> 39:50.088
Well, you don't get to be
miss head of the class

39:50.123 --> 39:52.157
without finishing all
of your assignments.

39:52.192 --> 39:54.893
So you finally settled
on a theme, did you?

39:54.928 --> 39:57.062
I interpreted "The opposite of me"

39:57.097 --> 39:59.331
as qualities in others that I admire.

39:59.366 --> 40:03.034
Mm. Sounds interesting.
[glasses clatter]

40:03.070 --> 40:04.169
I look forward
to reading it someday.

40:04.204 --> 40:05.904
I've got it right here.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.552
I'm proud of it, actually.

40:13.847 --> 40:16.281
[clears throat]

40:16.316 --> 40:21.853
- Out loud, please?
- Oh, yeah?

40:21.889 --> 40:25.260
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Um... [clears throat]

40:25.295 --> 40:27.826
"She travels through the path
of life with purpose

40:27.861 --> 40:30.795
as clear and pure as spring water.

40:30.831 --> 40:34.619
He strength is my refuge
from every impending storm."

40:34.816 --> 40:36.085
Mm-mm. {*trnscr}

40:36.119 --> 40:37.802
- It's about Angela.
- Mmm...

40:37.934 --> 40:41.151
What?!
It's so nice, Maura. Thank you.

40:41.348 --> 40:44.655
- [knocks on table] More please!
- Um, yeah... [clears throat]

40:45.124 --> 40:49.343
"His cunning and instincts
are sharper than the fox. [chuckles]

40:49.385 --> 40:52.362
His wisdom, kind and true."

40:52.734 --> 40:54.212
- That's about me.
- Korsak.

40:54.344 --> 40:56.557
Yeah. Of course.
[clears throat]

40:56.592 --> 40:58.220
Okay. Come on. Come on!
Find another friend.

40:58.318 --> 41:03.245
Uh... ah.
"She's fierce and frost to defend me,

41:03.308 --> 41:05.495
<i>in my moment of trouble or need.</i>

41:05.496 --> 41:09.998
<i>Her wit and love to sustain me,
and never coming my expense.</i>

41:09.999 --> 41:13.124
And when we part, there's no sadness.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.824
Because our bond is always there
she's not just my friend,

41:16.859 --> 41:21.081
she's a gift,
both precious and rare."

41:21.349 --> 41:23.581
- Maura...
- Sorry, it's about Nina.

41:23.765 --> 41:25.897
- Is not!
- [laughs] I'm just kidding!

41:26.106 --> 41:28.888
Always funny games till
someone ends up in tears.

41:29.168 --> 41:32.379
[sneezes]
Or looking like the older men. Bye.

41:32.414 --> 41:35.586
- [gasps] Or an apple!
- Oh, dear!

41:35.621 --> 41:38.466
- Yeah! That's wit!
- [gasping] Oh!

41:38.571 --> 41:40.300
<i>- Angela!
- Ma!</i>
