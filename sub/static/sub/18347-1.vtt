Over! Yes!

At last.
Just listen to them out there.

Yes. That's another one

They can't finish us off, can they?

00:42.372 --> 00:44.041

'The story of one man's response

03:26.616 --> 03:30.912
'This is the story of one man.

03:31.039 --> 03:32.915
Times have changed, Father.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.670
ln industry nowadays
they're crying out for people like me.

03:36.796 --> 03:40.550
ln my days, the university man
went into one of the learned professions,

03:40.676 --> 03:45.638
if he had any brains. If he hadn't,
it was either the Church or the army.

03:45.765 --> 03:47.057
I tried the army, Father.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.936
- Did you?
- Yes, of course you did.

03:50.062 --> 03:52.063
I say. Mr Windrush.

03:52.189 --> 03:54.150
I’m terribly sorry, Mr Windrush,

03:54.275 --> 03:56.486
but one of our balls
is just near the table.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.820
Could we have it, please?

03:57.947 --> 04:00.408
Yes. That's all right, yes.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.078
Stanley, get it for her, will you?

04:07.166 --> 04:08.585
Please, don't throw it.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.962
I’m a frightfully bad catch.

04:14.968 --> 04:16.218
It's the major's fault.

04:16.344 --> 04:18.637
He's got such a terribly strong service.-

04:19.514 --> 04:21.558
- Thanks most awfully.
- All right.

04:30.028 --> 04:33.615
Heavens, Father... is that
a sample of the local talent?

04:33.741 --> 04:36.367
Talent?
That's our Miss Forsdyke.

04:36.494 --> 04:38.662
Not a natural blonde, of course.

04:38.788 --> 04:41.124
- Thirty-love.
- No...

04:41.249 --> 04:45.129
Well, I suppose you're used to living here,
but I know I should find it most unnerving.

04:45.254 --> 04:47.798
Nonsense, Stanley!
It's simply a question of attitude.

04:47.925 --> 04:50.176
Here we're down to fundamentals.

04:50.303 --> 04:51.845
I wouldn’t disagree with that, Father.

04:51.971 --> 04:56.559
Dignity and privacy, Stanley,
only exist nowadays in a place like this.

04:56.685 --> 04:59.188
Not on the tennis courts, Father.

04:59.314 --> 05:01.900
- You staying to lunch?
- Erm... no, I don't think I will.

05:02.025 --> 05:04.319
I’ve got to be at the University
Appointments Board this afternoon.

05:04.445 --> 05:07.447
I still don't understand
why anybody brought up as a gentleman

05:07.574 --> 05:09.951
should choose to go into industry.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.619
Well, of course,
I shall be an executive.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.414
- Decided where you're going to live?
- That rather depends.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.125
I’m staying with Aunt Dolly
at the moment.

05:16.252 --> 05:18.336
Aunt Dolly?
Why, your Uncle Bertie's mother.

05:18.463 --> 05:19.922
ls she still alive?

05:20.047 --> 05:22.216
- Well, she was this morning.
- Really?

05:22.342 --> 05:25.177
Yoo-hoo, Mr Windrush.

05:25.304 --> 05:28.014
We've quite worn the major out,
Mr Windrush.

05:28.140 --> 05:31.185
Do you think we could tempt
your son to join us for a game?

05:31.311 --> 05:35.190
No, I’m afraid not.
Terribly sorry!

05:36.067 --> 05:38.611
Father, I really must be going. I’ll, erm...

05:38.736 --> 05:41.823
I’ll let you know how I get on
at the interview.

05:47.790 --> 05:51.084
There's no doubt about it.

05:51.211 --> 05:53.671
Industry today offers a young man
tremendous opportunities,

05:53.797 --> 05:55.465
provided he has three things:

05:55.590 --> 05:58.260
confidence,
intelligence, and enthusiasm.

05:58.386 --> 06:00.930
Now, what particular industry
had you in mind?

06:01.056 --> 06:04.183
Well, I was thinking of
something not too heavy, sir.

06:04.311 --> 06:05.352
Not too heavy?

06:05.478 --> 06:09.816
Well, not, for example a thumping
great business like iron and steel.

06:10.484 --> 06:12.945
I see. Light industry, eh?

06:13.070 --> 06:15.032
And preferably near London

06:15.157 --> 06:16.700
with early closing.

06:18.828 --> 06:19.911
With what?

06:21.539 --> 06:25.336
Well, I thought perhaps
one afternoon a week.

06:25.837 --> 06:27.880
You do expect to work, I suppose?

06:28.006 --> 06:30.382
Good Lord, yes, sir.
I’m not afraid of hard work.

06:30.884 --> 06:34.304
Given the opportunity,
I’m confident I shall get to the top.

06:36.516 --> 06:37.976
Well, I hope you're right.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.227
Well, I’ll arrange
some appointments for you

06:40.355 --> 06:43.273
and send you a list of people
you can go and see.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.527
- I hope you have some luck.
- Thank you very much, sir.

06:48.197 --> 06:50.282
Windrush! Don't forget...

06:50.408 --> 06:53.536
Intelligence, enthusiasm,
and an air of confidence.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.831
Above all, an air of confidence.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.001
I won't, sir.

detergent-producing nations of the world.

Now, before I take you
and show you around the factory,

07:43.723 --> 07:45.433
are there any questions
you'd like to ask me?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.604
You also make Frisko, which costs less.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.065
What's the difference
between that and Detto, sir?

07:51.191 --> 07:55.112
Basically none.
It's a question of packaging.

07:55.238 --> 07:56.822
Detto, as you see,
has the larger carton,

07:56.949 --> 07:59.994
but they contain identical quantities.

08:00.119 --> 08:02.745
Detto is aimed at the young housewife.

08:03.456 --> 08:04.916
lt might interest you to know, sir,

08:05.041 --> 08:07.252
that I have a great aunt
who tried Frisko once,

08:07.378 --> 08:09.797
and she came out
in an appalling rash.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.841
ls that so?

08:11.967 --> 08:14.093
lt may interest you to know
that my babies' napkins

08:14.219 --> 08:15.553
have always been washed in Frisko

08:15.680 --> 08:18.640
and that no child has shown
a sign of a spot since birth.

08:20.895 --> 08:23.355
Of course,
my aunt's rash was on her arm.

08:27.194 --> 08:28.235
Next question?

08:28.362 --> 08:30.615
What is the manufacturing cost, sir?

08:30.740 --> 08:33.659
Now, that's a very good question.
I’m glad you asked that.

08:33.784 --> 08:36.038
The actual cost of the contents
of these two packets

08:36.163 --> 08:39.082
does not exceed
three tenths of a penny.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.710
The retail price...

08:40.835 --> 08:44.087
eleven pence...
ten pence ha'penny!

08:44.215 --> 08:45.424
Now, what does that indicate?

08:45.550 --> 08:46.884
A whacking great profit.

08:54.811 --> 08:57.188
To market a commodity
it is necessary to exploit.

08:57.314 --> 08:58.606
And that costs money.

08:58.733 --> 09:01.236
Currently we are giving away
a set of electroplated teaspoons

09:01.361 --> 09:04.072

of Detto purchased.

09:04.198 --> 09:06.909

10:12.615 --> 10:13.949

Thank you very much, sir.

10:17.329 --> 10:19.122
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:19.248 --> 10:21.000
Here, try one.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.127
- That's very kind of you, sir.
- Not at all.

10:23.253 --> 10:25.338
Thank you very much.

10:28.051 --> 10:30.177
- Do you like it?
- Mm...?

10:30.304 --> 10:32.388
It's our new summer formula.

10:32.514 --> 10:35.017
Fascinating. What's in it?

10:35.142 --> 10:37.686
- What's in it?

10:37.812 --> 10:40.148
Come on, I’ll show you.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.824
And now, then, this is the first stage
of the mixing process.

10:47.949 --> 10:49.284
You see, each pipe up there

10:49.410 --> 10:52.372
gives the intermittent one-minute
discharge of the basic ingredients

10:52.498 --> 10:55.958
into a rotating barrel inside here.
Go on, eat it up.

10:57.545 --> 10:59.797
That's right. You see,
the timing of the flow

10:59.923 --> 11:01.716
determines the quantities,
as per formula.

11:01.842 --> 11:03.426
Now then, every four minutes,

11:03.552 --> 11:05.096
a pressure-operated relief valve

11:05.221 --> 11:07.933
discharges the mixture out of here
into this duct

11:08.058 --> 11:10.102
on its way to the next stage.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.312
There she goes.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.363
Come on, taste it.

11:20.198 --> 11:22.282
Go on, it's quite cool.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.332
- Good?
- Mm...

11:28.458 --> 11:30.543
OK, all right, follow me.

11:31.379 --> 11:33.755
Now, here we have
the cooling and blowing tunnel.

11:33.881 --> 11:36.467
You see, air jets cool the mixture
to the required consistency,

11:36.592 --> 11:40.222
simultaneously blowing it up...

11:47.273 --> 11:49.066
Now, then, you taste this.

11:49.191 --> 11:52.278
Haven't you finished it yet?
You are a slowcoach. Come on!

11:57.077 --> 11:59.078
That's all right, have the lot.
Go on, swill it down.

12:07.255 --> 12:09.175
You see, it's all mellow, isn't it?

12:09.300 --> 12:11.385
Yes, all right, come on, over here.

12:18.479 --> 12:20.562
Here the mixture has solidified...

12:20.689 --> 12:23.192
Not here, Miss Hackney!
Please, dear!

12:23.317 --> 12:25.819
Here, try a bit.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.321
Now...

12:31.410 --> 12:33.370
Now, this machine,
as you see, stamps out

12:33.497 --> 12:37.042
a two-and-a-half-ounce uncoated block.
Here, tuck in.

12:38.711 --> 12:41.005
Each machine
cuts 48,000 blocks a day...

12:41.130 --> 12:43.674
You're not eating.
Go on, enjoy yourself.

12:43.801 --> 12:45.928
...at the rate of
approximately 2,000 an hour.

12:46.053 --> 12:48.138
Now, from here, we go down here.

12:51.352 --> 12:53.478
And, this is the enrobing chamber,

12:53.605 --> 12:57.567
where the blocks are coated with icing,
of course, and decorated.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.417
This is my favourite machine.

13:16.632 --> 13:19.761
I say...
ls there anything wrong, old man?

13:22.849 --> 13:24.433
My hat!

13:24.559 --> 13:26.227
Pretty overwhelming, isn't it?

13:26.353 --> 13:27.728
Come on, round the other side.

13:29.858 --> 13:33.151
And here we have the coated blocks -
soft, milky, delicious.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.238
All ready for stamping
with a walnut and a cherry.

13:35.364 --> 13:37.866
Now all that remains is to wrap 'em,
pack 'em, dispatch 'em.

13:37.993 --> 13:40.077
There we are.

13:57.391 --> 13:59.434
Seen everything, my boy?

14:02.732 --> 14:06.318
Course, it isn't easy to digest,
all in one go, you know.

14:24.132 --> 14:26.508
- 'He's turned out to be...'
- Look I...

14:26.636 --> 14:29.804
'...some adolescent, stupid moron...

14:29.932 --> 14:31.599
'Are you sure he was at Oxford?'

14:31.725 --> 14:32.934
I can only say I'm sorry.

14:33.060 --> 14:36.313
'I ought to tell you that he created
a damned bad impression upon my staff...'

14:37.608 --> 14:40.360
Look, I can't do more
than apologize now, can I?

14:40.486 --> 14:42.529
'...all I know...

14:42.655 --> 14:45.658
'...like that. Well, for God's sake,
don't get me a maniac...'

14:45.784 --> 14:49.245
Well, I’m sorry. I’m extremely sorry,
but goodbye!

14:49.372 --> 14:51.666
It's that fellow Windrush again.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.918
Take this letter,
Miss Harvey, would you?

14:54.044 --> 14:55.461
Dear Windrush,

14:55.588 --> 14:58.256
your appointment
yesterday with Mr Bartlett,

14:58.383 --> 15:00.842
Managing Director
of the British Corset Company,

15:00.970 --> 15:02.345
brackets,

15:02.471 --> 15:03.638
Foundation of the Nation,

15:03.765 --> 15:05.683
close brackets, Limited,

15:05.808 --> 15:08.769
was the eleventh granted you
in the past ten days.

15:08.896 --> 15:12.357
'ln view of the singular lack of
appreciation you have encountered,

15:12.483 --> 15:16.237
'I am led seriously to doubt
whether you and industry are compatible.

15:16.364 --> 15:18.073
'Yours faithfully...'

15:18.198 --> 15:21.410
Your Uncle Bertram and a gentleman
have called to see you, Master Stanley.

15:21.537 --> 15:24.163
They're having tea with your Aunt Dolly
in the drawing room.

15:24.288 --> 15:26.374
Thank you, Spencer.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.882
Here's your tea, my pretties.

15:34.218 --> 15:35.594
Here is Stanley.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.513
- Hello, Aunt Dolly.
- Hello, darling.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.932
- Hello, young fellow.
- Hello, Uncle.

15:40.059 --> 15:42.227
I don't think
you know Mr De Vere Cox.

15:42.353 --> 15:43.771
Yes, he does, Lady Dorothy.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.023
We was comrades-in-arms together
during the last war.

15:46.150 --> 15:49.485
Coxie! Good graciousness me!
What on earth are you doing here?

15:49.612 --> 15:51.406
He's a business friend of your uncle’s.

15:51.531 --> 15:53.074
Matter of fact, we've come
to do you a bit of good, Stan.

15:53.199 --> 15:54.284
Really?

15:54.410 --> 15:55.994
May I give you
another cup of tea, Mr Cox?

15:56.121 --> 15:57.203
Thank you, milady.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.165
Mother tells me
you want to go into industry.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.293
That's right, Uncle.
They're crying out for people,

16:01.418 --> 16:04.171
but... oh, well,
it doesn't seem very easy to get in.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.338
M...

16:05.466 --> 16:09.720
Well, Stanley, I happen to be a director
of quite an important engineering firm.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.305
Missiles.

16:11.431 --> 16:13.223
How would you like to join us?

16:13.349 --> 16:15.643
That'd be wonderful, Uncle.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.606
Well, of course it would, Stanley.
And this is the right time, too.

16:18.731 --> 16:20.941
Your uncle’s firm is just about
to land a big arms contract.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.819
Actually, it was Coxie's idea
that I should take you on.

16:23.946 --> 16:26.031
Thank you very much, Coxie.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.783
Well... what would I have to do?

16:27.910 --> 16:30.578
Well, I expect you’ll just supervise, dear.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.414
After all, you were at Oxford.

16:32.539 --> 16:35.585
The first thing to do is to apply
to the local labour exchange.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.962
- Labour exchange?
- That's right!

16:38.089 --> 16:41.509
I... I did suggest
to your Uncle Bertie, Stanley,

16:41.634 --> 16:44.513
that you might, perhaps
go in on the other side.

16:44.638 --> 16:45.764
What other side?

16:45.890 --> 16:47.682
B-become a worker.

16:47.809 --> 16:50.436
- A worker.
- Unskilled, of course.

16:50.562 --> 16:52.980
Does Mr Cox seriously suggest, Bertie,

16:53.107 --> 16:56.485
that Stanley should throw in his lot
with the working classes?

16:56.611 --> 16:58.488
I’m perfectly serious.

16:58.614 --> 17:01.157
Tell me, Stanley,
on the management side,

17:01.283 --> 17:03.159
what sort of money
would you hope to start with?

17:03.286 --> 17:05.079
About...

17:05.204 --> 17:06.498
eight pounds a week.

17:06.623 --> 17:08.458
Well, there you are, Lady Dorothy.

17:08.584 --> 17:10.670
I mean, if you were an unskilled worker,

17:10.795 --> 17:13.256
you union would see
you never got as little as that.

17:13.382 --> 17:17.261
What's more, as a proper worker,
Stanley, you're important.

17:17.387 --> 17:18.929
Politicians need your vote,

17:19.056 --> 17:21.266
so they fall over themselves
trying to make you happy.

17:21.392 --> 17:24.728
Can you imagine our Stanley here,
all muscles and sweat?

17:24.854 --> 17:27.522
No, no, no, no, no, dear Indy!

17:27.648 --> 17:29.901
You've got hold of
the wrong end of the conception.

17:30.026 --> 17:32.821
These days, it's the management
who does all the, er...

17:32.948 --> 17:35.241
perspiring.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.910
I mean, you take
an up-to-date firm like Missiles.

17:38.037 --> 17:42.083
Your Uncle Bertie's given himself ulcers
trying to make them more efficient

17:42.209 --> 17:44.669
and tell the men
it means a bigger wage packet.

17:44.796 --> 17:46.588
And you’ll be the one
who gets it, Stanley.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.924
I must say, it does sound attractive,
Aunt Dolly.

17:49.050 --> 17:53.305
I couldn’t bear the thought of you
having to join one of those horrid unions.

17:53.432 --> 17:55.223
Well, I don't suppose one has to.

17:55.350 --> 17:57.727
- I so hate violence.
- Nonsense, Mother!

17:57.854 --> 17:59.937
That sort of thing
doesn't happen nowadays.

18:01.232 --> 18:04.027
Well, Stanley, what about it, eh?

18:05.279 --> 18:07.489
Well, Uncle...

18:07.615 --> 18:09.408
would I be able to work my way up?

18:10.702 --> 18:13.037
Of course. ln time.

18:14.749 --> 18:16.541
All right.

18:16.667 --> 18:17.752
I’ll have a go.

18:17.878 --> 18:19.545
Very sensible.

18:19.671 --> 18:21.380
Mind you,
don't mention to anyone at the works

18:21.507 --> 18:22.799
that your uncle’s
on the board of directors.

18:22.926 --> 18:28.139
lt, er... could disturb the industrial peace.

18:32.562 --> 18:35.231
'The gates had opened
on a brand new age,

18:35.358 --> 18:37.776
'and through them marched the people.

18:37.903 --> 18:42.657
'The blues of bygone days had faded
into a prospect pink and bright

18:42.784 --> 18:45.494
'as they marched happily to their work.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.120
'Beckoned by opportunity,

18:47.248 --> 18:52.336
'the British worker responded with
a new sense of the dignity of labour.

18:52.462 --> 18:54.880
'To match his age-old traditions

18:55.006 --> 18:57.216
'of brotherhood and comradeship.'

19:29.841 --> 19:31.634
- Here you are, Knowlesey.
- Ay.

19:31.759 --> 19:34.762
Here you are, Knowlesey.
A nice little two-shilling double for today.

19:34.889 --> 19:37.308
- From Bertie in the machine shop.
- Ta, mate.

19:37.434 --> 19:39.268
Did you do the one
I give you Friday, Charlie?

19:39.395 --> 19:42.731
Get out. I did the horse you give me on
Thursday and it's still running.

19:42.857 --> 19:45.192
Knowles! Knowles!

19:45.319 --> 19:47.194
Watch it, here comes Crawley!

19:47.321 --> 19:48.447
Knowles, come here.

19:50.658 --> 19:53.744
This new man here, Knowles.
I’m putting him on the trucks with you.

19:53.871 --> 19:55.997
- Give him the low-down, will you?
- Right, Mr Crawley.

19:56.124 --> 19:57.416
Come on, you men. Start work!

19:57.542 --> 19:59.001
Come on!

19:59.127 --> 20:01.211
Come on, get cracking. Come on.

20:02.465 --> 20:06.634
That's a nice, er... smooth bit of stuff,
ain't it, squire?

20:06.762 --> 20:08.846
- Got your overalls?
- I’m afraid I haven't.

20:08.972 --> 20:12.100
Ooh, you'd better buy some quick,
otherwise you’ll have the major after you.

20:12.226 --> 20:14.311
- Major?
- Yeah, Old Itchy, the personnel manager.

20:14.438 --> 20:16.773
What you might call everybody's auntie.

20:17.901 --> 20:19.610
That's all right
for the brass at Head Office.

20:19.736 --> 20:21.820
They don't actually have to deal
with the workers.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.864
As personnel officer, that's my job.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.116
God help me!

20:25.242 --> 20:27.787
And I can tell you,
they're an absolute shower.

20:27.913 --> 20:29.455
A positive shower!

20:29.581 --> 20:31.958
But my instructions, Major Hitchcock,
are to carry out a time and motion study

20:32.084 --> 20:34.836
- in every department.
- Whose bright idea was that?

20:35.881 --> 20:38.466
Mr Tracepurcel, I suppose.
He engaged me.

20:38.592 --> 20:40.718
- Thank you.
- But surely the men must know that I...

20:40.845 --> 20:41.970
Know!

20:42.097 --> 20:43.389
Get this into your head.

20:43.515 --> 20:46.768
They know nothing other than what's
in their pay packet at the end of the week.

20:46.894 --> 20:51.565
We've got chaps here who can break out
into a muck sweat merely by standing still.

20:51.691 --> 20:53.485
One thing they can't stand
is being stopwatched.

20:53.610 --> 20:54.985
But the sole purpose
of a time and motion study

20:55.113 --> 20:58.658
is to enable the men to work efficiently,
well within their natural capacity.

20:58.784 --> 21:00.326
Capacity!

21:00.452 --> 21:02.830
My dear fellow, the only capacity
natural to these stinkers

21:02.955 --> 21:04.915
is the capacity to dodge the column.

21:08.754 --> 21:10.088
Sorry, old chap!

21:10.215 --> 21:13.759
Letting off steam like that.
Had rather a punishing night, last night.

21:13.885 --> 21:16.304
Did a spot of time and motion study
of my own.

21:16.431 --> 21:19.766
Redhead. Rather athletic.

21:20.726 --> 21:23.814
- Quite!
- Well, not to worry, old boy!

21:23.939 --> 21:26.024
I shall just have to think of a way
for you do your stuff

21:26.151 --> 21:27.818
without these rotters cottoning on.

21:27.944 --> 21:29.529
lt won't be easy, though.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.573
The last time and motion fellow we had

21:31.699 --> 21:33.992
tried to pass himself off
as one of the workers.

21:34.119 --> 21:35.786
They rumbled him right away.

21:35.912 --> 21:37.455
Poor chap's still in hospital.

21:40.501 --> 21:41.544
Up...

21:42.963 --> 21:43.963
down.

21:45.842 --> 21:46.883
- Dead simple.
- I must say.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.677
lt looks a jolly efficient little job.

21:48.804 --> 21:50.221
lt must be great fun driving it.

21:50.346 --> 21:51.764
Yes, well, all you've got to worry
about is to remember

21:51.891 --> 21:54.350
to plug in here at nights,
when you knock off work,

21:54.478 --> 21:56.687
so the batteries are fully charged
when you come in in the morning.

21:56.813 --> 21:59.107
Terrific. It's so simple.

21:59.232 --> 22:01.359
The man hours saved
must be colossal.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.529
Yes. Well, we're on
a fixed-bonus system,

22:03.654 --> 22:05.615
so there's no need
to go flogging your guts out.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.991
I dare say, but after all,

22:07.117 --> 22:09.828
one of these trucks must be able
to do the work of a dozen men.

22:09.954 --> 22:13.040
Not half, really, don't you know?

22:17.339 --> 22:20.592
You're, er... dead keen,
ain't you, squire?

22:20.717 --> 22:23.136
Could you just
run over the thing once again? I...

22:23.262 --> 22:25.889
Dai, we've got another one.
Go on, go and tell 'em.

22:26.016 --> 22:28.060
Good idea, Charlie.

22:31.564 --> 22:34.816
...so when he started shooting off
about efficiency

22:34.944 --> 22:38.947
and doing the work of ten men,
Brother Carter suggested

22:39.074 --> 22:42.159
that I should report the matter formally
to the shop steward.

22:42.285 --> 22:43.745
Very commendable, lad.

22:44.914 --> 22:46.582
On a point of order, Brother Chair,

22:46.707 --> 22:48.251
if he is one of them
time and motion blokes,

22:48.376 --> 22:51.672
we'll have to move quick otherwise he'll
stopwatch the men on the job

22:51.797 --> 22:54.758
and we'll find ourselves with tighter
schedules for the same rate of pay.

22:54.884 --> 22:58.931
Exactly, brother. Exactly. But we have to
play this thing rather careful.

22:59.056 --> 23:02.226
On the one hand, we must be fair
to the man concerned,

23:02.352 --> 23:05.272
yet on the other hand, we don't wish to
raise issues with the management

23:05.397 --> 23:07.857
which will reverberate back
to our detriment.

23:07.984 --> 23:09.150
Hear, hear!

23:12.991 --> 23:15.659
This lot's got to be shifted to dispatch.
We'll start this end.

23:15.785 --> 23:19.956
If you don't mind,
I’ll start on my own, down here.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.712
- Watch it!
- 'Ere, what's your game?

23:24.838 --> 23:25.879
Frightfully sorry!

23:27.632 --> 23:30.343
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...
- 'Ere, who's gonna sort this lot out?

23:30.470 --> 23:32.471
- You berk!
- Are you potty or something?

23:43.612 --> 23:45.362
- Right, play 21 .
- Same here.

23:45.488 --> 23:47.364
Good lord, man,
what the hell do you think you're doing?

23:47.490 --> 23:50.160
- Shut that bleeding door!
- Go on! Get off out of it, will you?

23:50.286 --> 23:53.205
I do beg your pardon.
I'm new here.

23:53.331 --> 23:56.209
- I should bloody well think you are.
- Now, you bring those things back here,

23:56.335 --> 23:58.503
and you get back up the other end.
That's where you ought to be.

23:58.630 --> 23:59.755
You berk!

24:08.266 --> 24:11.310
I don't know, they're taking on some
proper charlies nowadays, aren't they?

24:13.314 --> 24:14.522
Right, here we go again.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.486
- What are you doing?
- Three!

24:19.405 --> 24:21.073
I say...

24:21.199 --> 24:23.200
The most extraordinary thing.

24:23.327 --> 24:24.702
I moved some crates down there,

24:24.828 --> 24:26.454
and there were some chaps
playing cards.

24:26.581 --> 24:30.042
- They were absolutely furious.
- No, well, I told you to start this end.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.795
But who are they?

24:31.920 --> 24:33.713
They are what is called redundant.

24:33.839 --> 24:34.965
The management
wanted to sack 'em,

24:35.091 --> 24:36.425
but the works committee said
if they did,

24:36.550 --> 24:37.677
we'd all come out on strike.

24:37.803 --> 24:39.220
So, they're kept on as checkers.

24:39.346 --> 24:41.472
Ha! But don't expect them
to check anything.

24:41.599 --> 24:44.560
Now, come on, get weaving
and only one at a time, mind you.

24:55.741 --> 24:58.202
- That's him, Mr Kite.
- You!

24:58.327 --> 24:59.370
You!

25:00.288 --> 25:02.289
What do you think you're doing?

25:02.417 --> 25:04.166
Frightfully sorry.

25:04.293 --> 25:06.461
Afraid I haven't quite got this thing
buttoned up yet.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.047
What's your name?

25:08.173 --> 25:09.382
Windrush!

25:09.508 --> 25:12.052
Me and my colleagues
are the works committee.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.846
How do you do?

25:13.972 --> 25:15.765
Would you mind
producing your union card?

25:15.891 --> 25:18.435
I’m afraid I can't.-

25:18.561 --> 25:20.896
Well, you see,
I happen to be staying with an aunt

25:21.022 --> 25:23.441
who has rather strong feelings
about unions.

25:23.567 --> 25:25.986
She's not the only one
with strong feelings, mate.

25:26.112 --> 25:28.322
- It's not compulsory, is it?
- No, it's not compulsory,

25:28.448 --> 25:30.158
Only you've got to join, see?

25:30.284 --> 25:32.827
Well, if it's not compulsory
that's all right, I’ll join.

25:32.954 --> 25:34.413
Have you ever done
this sort of job before?

25:34.538 --> 25:35.749
I’m afraid I haven't.

25:35.874 --> 25:37.040
What brought you here, then?

25:37.168 --> 25:39.210
Well, it all started
when I was recommended

25:39.336 --> 25:41.254
to take up industrial management.

25:42.006 --> 25:44.091
Industrial management!

25:46.095 --> 25:47.554
All right, mate, off you get.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.098
- Alf, call a stoppage of the truck drivers.
- Right.

25:50.225 --> 25:52.143
Brother Carter,
take charge of his truck.

25:52.269 --> 25:54.562
Don't you do nothing
till your case has been gone into.

25:59.068 --> 26:01.154
Come on, get off it!

26:07.496 --> 26:08.538
Creep!

26:09.957 --> 26:12.460
My dear fellow,
we're living in the welfare state.

26:12.585 --> 26:15.546
I call it the farewell state.
The soldier's farewell.

26:15.672 --> 26:18.675
Sorry, Major. Just heard there's trouble
on the way. The shop stewards.

26:18.802 --> 26:21.053
Damn it! There you are, Waters,
what did I tell you?

26:21.180 --> 26:22.305
They're on to you already.

26:22.431 --> 26:25.851
These fellows could smell out a time
and motion man in a litter of polecats.

26:25.976 --> 26:29.105
Henry, take Waters outside
and camouflage him. Come on.

26:57.975 --> 27:00.227
- ls he in?
- Good morning, Mr Kite.

27:00.353 --> 27:04.231
Well, he's very busy, but I know
he's always pleased to see you.

27:04.358 --> 27:05.358
Will you come this way?

27:08.696 --> 27:11.156
The works committee
to see you, Major.

27:11.283 --> 27:14.619
Come in, take a pew.

27:14.745 --> 27:15.788
Cigarette?

27:15.913 --> 27:18.081
After due deliberation,
Major Hitchcock,

27:18.208 --> 27:20.293
the works committee
has had to call a stoppage

27:20.419 --> 27:21.962
in response to our members' wishes.

27:22.088 --> 27:25.383
Well, what precisely is the trouble?

27:25.508 --> 27:27.093
The members feel that the agreement

27:27.218 --> 27:29.679
negotiated with respect to
time and motion study

27:29.806 --> 27:32.474
- is being contravened.
- That's impossible!

27:32.601 --> 27:35.186
You know me. I wouldn't do anything
behind the backs of the unions.

27:35.312 --> 27:37.397
Then, perhaps, Major Hitchcock,
you can explain

27:37.524 --> 27:38.941
the presence of this new man.

27:39.066 --> 27:42.236
New man?
But he hasn't started yet.

27:42.362 --> 27:44.072
Hasn't started yet?

27:44.197 --> 27:48.077
Then what's he doing
on a f-f-f-forklift truck?

27:48.202 --> 27:49.787
- Who?
- Windrush.

27:49.914 --> 27:54.126
Wind... That name rings a bell.
Get his particulars.

27:54.252 --> 27:56.170
Let's be perfectly frank
with each other, Major.

27:56.296 --> 27:57.881
This man is not a genuine worker.

27:58.007 --> 27:59.299
He's admitted as much.

27:59.425 --> 28:01.427
And in permitting him to drive
one of them trucks,

28:01.552 --> 28:04.013
I would say the management
is willfully chiropodising

28:04.139 --> 28:06.141
the safety of its employees.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.186
What is more, Major,
he does not hold a union card.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.396
- Here you are, Major.
- Thank you.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.443
But you're absolutely right.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.820
It's that damned labour exchange again.

28:16.947 --> 28:19.491
Henry, this man
must be sacked immediately.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.743
Well now, do you see
what we're up against?

28:21.869 --> 28:25.998
Nowadays they send us anybody.
Just anybody.

28:26.125 --> 28:29.544
I must say, I'm really grateful to you chaps
for drawing this matter to my attention.

28:29.671 --> 28:34.717
I mean, after all, it is up to the unions
to help us keep out the incompetents.

28:35.469 --> 28:39.265
Er... If you do not mind, Major,
we would all like to withdraw and consult.

28:39.391 --> 28:42.476
- By all means, go ahead.
- Thank you.

28:51.572 --> 28:53.241
That was a near one.

28:53.366 --> 28:55.368
I thought they were onto Waters.

28:55.494 --> 28:56.953
What a shower.

28:57.079 --> 28:59.373
I’d better get on to Crawley
and tell him to pay this man off.

28:59.499 --> 29:01.166
Yes, and at the same time,
give him a rocket

29:01.292 --> 29:03.294
for employing the twerp
in the first place.

29:03.421 --> 29:05.255
Come in!

29:08.844 --> 29:12.180
My colleagues here have instructed me
to put to you one question, Major.

29:12.306 --> 29:14.599
Certainly, go ahead, my dear fellow.

29:14.726 --> 29:18.272
ls it, or is it not your intention
to sack this man?

29:18.397 --> 29:19.648
Sack him, of course.

29:35.501 --> 29:37.545
I am obliged to point out, Major,
that if you sack this man,

29:37.671 --> 29:40.381
the company is in breach
of its agreement with the union.

29:40.508 --> 29:41.841
But surely,
he's not a union member.

29:41.968 --> 29:44.178
Correct, but, that is merely technical.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.681
But didn't you say
that he was incompetent

29:46.807 --> 29:47.974
and couldn't do his job properly?

29:48.100 --> 29:51.812
We do not and cannot accept the principle
that incompetence justifies dismissal.

29:51.938 --> 29:53.189
That is victimization.

29:53.316 --> 29:54.648
- That's right.
- Hear, hear!

29:54.776 --> 29:57.987
Well, we... we seem to have been
at cross purposes.

29:58.112 --> 30:01.699
I was under the impression that it was
you chaps who objected to this fellow.

30:01.825 --> 30:05.037
That was before we was
in full possession of the facts.

30:05.163 --> 30:07.832
Well, in that case
everything's absolutely splendid,

30:07.957 --> 30:09.166
and the fellow can stay on.

30:09.293 --> 30:11.629
Well, I think we can
all congratulate ourselves

30:11.754 --> 30:14.215
on a most productive morning's work.

30:14.342 --> 30:16.760
We haven't had
a stoppage like this for ages.

30:16.885 --> 30:18.302
Not since the week before last.

30:22.351 --> 30:23.684
I’m terribly sorry about it.

30:23.811 --> 30:25.896
Ooh, you don't want to be sorry, squire.

30:26.021 --> 30:28.273
lt makes a nice little break, don't it?

30:34.032 --> 30:37.076
- What's up now?
- Dinner time. Come on, cock.

30:37.202 --> 30:40.163
Blimey. All go today, innit?

30:40.289 --> 30:43.126
Our chairman,
as you know, is indisposed,

30:43.251 --> 30:46.504
but he has asked me to say
how much Missiles value

30:46.631 --> 30:50.385
the placing with us
of this important arms contract.

30:50.510 --> 30:53.471
Satisfaction that is strengthened
by the knowledge

30:53.597 --> 30:56.141
that in supplying your country
with arms,

30:56.268 --> 31:01.063
Missiles are making their own special
contribution to the peace of the world.

31:01.190 --> 31:02.274
Hear, hear!

31:02.400 --> 31:04.025
On a personal note,

31:04.153 --> 31:08.365
I would like to pay tribute
to his Excellency, Mr Mohammed here,

31:08.490 --> 31:12.703
whose charm as a diplomat is
well matched by his personal integrity.

31:12.830 --> 31:13.871
Hear! Hear!

31:13.998 --> 31:18.084
The success of these negotiations
is entirely due to him.

31:18.211 --> 31:20.796
- Thank you, Mr Mohammed.
- Thank you.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.133
You flatter me, Mr Tracepurcel.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.760
I am no diplomat,
I'm a simple businessman.

31:25.888 --> 31:29.348
My dear sir, no.
We're both simple businessmen.

31:29.474 --> 31:32.269
Excuse me, sir.
There's a rather urgent call.

31:32.394 --> 31:34.188
Will you excuse me.
A rather urgent call.

31:34.315 --> 31:36.399
- Of course.
- Thank you.

31:47.121 --> 31:49.206
- Did you enjoy your lunch?
- Very much, thank you!

31:49.333 --> 31:50.876
Good!

31:51.001 --> 31:54.671
Yes, the deal's just been signed.

31:54.797 --> 31:57.759
Now, listen very carefully, Cox.

31:57.885 --> 32:00.471
Leak the story to the papers
right away.

32:00.596 --> 32:02.723
By tomorrow, our shares
will have trebled in value

32:02.849 --> 32:04.600
and we'll start selling them off.

32:04.727 --> 32:08.648
By the end of the week, we should
have made a very nice tax-free killing.

32:08.773 --> 32:11.275
And then we can go ahead
with the rest of the plan.

32:11.401 --> 32:12.735
Huh?

32:12.862 --> 32:14.363
You don't have to worry about that.

32:14.489 --> 32:18.243
Stanley's nicely lined up.
He started work this morning.

32:18.368 --> 32:20.578
ln... Incidentally...

32:20.704 --> 32:24.625
I’ve been studying His Excellency
Mr Mohammed rather closely.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.587
I think he should prove cooperative.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.005
Yes, of course,
the trouble in the world today is

32:29.131 --> 32:32.134
that everybody
is out grabbing for himself.

32:32.261 --> 32:33.803
But in Britain it's so different.

32:33.929 --> 32:35.263
You play the game.

32:35.389 --> 32:37.641
Nice to hear you say that,
Mr Mohammed.

32:37.767 --> 32:40.478
It's a matter
of mutual confidence, really.

32:40.603 --> 32:43.523
And after all, every man
working for Missiles knows

32:43.649 --> 32:46.025
that we're all in the same game together.

32:46.152 --> 32:49.488
That essentially
we're all out for the same thing.

32:49.615 --> 32:52.409
Of course, you see, it's entirely different
in the Soviet Union.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.411
There they are all working
for the same thing.

32:54.538 --> 32:57.499
lt is...
lt is a classless society.

32:57.624 --> 32:58.874
Here, you've got to watch 'em.

32:59.002 --> 33:01.336
That is why the workers
have to stand solid.

33:01.463 --> 33:04.757
Yes, yes, they struck me
as being pretty solid.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.969
I must say it's very heartening
having you intellectuals

33:07.095 --> 33:09.305
coming into the working-class
movement like this.

33:09.432 --> 33:10.681
One has to do something.

33:10.808 --> 33:12.475
True, brother, true.

33:12.601 --> 33:15.313
I see from your particulars
you was at college in Oxford.

33:15.438 --> 33:16.564
Yes, I was.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.858
- Yes, I was up there meself.
- Really?

33:18.984 --> 33:22.280
Yes, I was
at the Balliol Summer School, 1946.

33:22.405 --> 33:24.531
Very good toast and preserves
they give you at teatime,

33:24.658 --> 33:27.118
- as you probably know.
- No, I didn't know, actually.

33:27.244 --> 33:29.704
- Well, there's your form, brother.
- Why, thank you.

33:29.831 --> 33:32.375
Pop in on your way home
and pay your dues at the branch.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.585
Got far to go, have you?

33:33.710 --> 33:36.797
Erm... Ooh, no,
it takes me about fifty minutes.

33:36.922 --> 33:40.593
I was wondering whether I ought to
try and find rooms nearer the works.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.263
Well, I might be able to help you there.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.434
- Mrs Kite takes in occasionally.

33:46.559 --> 33:48.478
Oh, well,
that's very kind of you, but...

33:48.604 --> 33:50.439
No, no, no.
As a matter of fact, I’d welcome it.

33:50.565 --> 33:53.901
I enjoy a bit of serious company
and good conversation.

33:54.402 --> 33:58.615
- Pop round and have a look at the rooms.
- Well, erm...

33:58.742 --> 34:02.870
Thank you very much, Mr Kite, but, um...
Well, perhaps I could let you know.

34:05.291 --> 34:06.375
Ooh...

34:07.543 --> 34:10.545
Er, Dad, tell Mum I’ll be in late tonight,
will you?

34:10.672 --> 34:11.840
Very well, Cynthia.

34:11.965 --> 34:13.509
You on overtime, are you?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.594
Don't be daft.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.848
Going up West... dancing.

34:25.273 --> 34:28.068
My daughter Cynthia.
Works here, spindle polishing.

34:30.781 --> 34:32.739
Really?

34:34.619 --> 34:36.703
Quite a job.

34:37.331 --> 34:41.000
Erm... that room
you were talking about just now...

34:41.127 --> 34:42.753
You sure it wouldn't be any trouble?

34:42.878 --> 34:45.214
No, no, Stanley, not a bit of it.

34:45.340 --> 34:48.467
Well, erm... perhaps I could pop round
and have a look at it.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.929
Erm... say tomorrow night?

34:51.054 --> 34:52.764
Tomorrow night.
Yes, capital, capital.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.934
- Tomorrow night, then.
- Good!

35:00.025 --> 35:02.944
Of course,
that's imperialism for you.

35:03.070 --> 35:05.990
I mean, you call the coloured chap inferior
and what have you got?

35:06.116 --> 35:08.367
Cheap labour.

35:08.493 --> 35:11.914
That's how the bosses make their profits
while half the world's starving.

35:12.039 --> 35:15.835
For goodness' sake!
Stop being such a' old misery!

35:15.961 --> 35:18.046
Here! Eat this!

35:19.132 --> 35:23.720
It's just that I don't like to see our class
behaving like the Gadarene swine.

35:23.846 --> 35:27.892
Here, you watch your language, Fred Kite,
if you don't mind...

35:28.018 --> 35:30.728
ln front of Mr Windrush.

35:30.855 --> 35:34.609
That girl with that gramophone again.
She'll never stop it.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.897
Yes, here's another good one
to start off.

36:06.023 --> 36:08.399
"Collective Childhood
and Factory Manhood".

36:08.526 --> 36:10.026
Sounds fun.

36:10.153 --> 36:11.654
Yes. Very descriptive.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.615
It's all about how they run factories
in a workers' state.

36:13.740 --> 36:16.409
However, I won't spoil it for you.

36:16.536 --> 36:18.579
Have you ever been to Russia, Mr Kite?

36:18.704 --> 36:22.667
No, not yet. The one place
I’d like to go to, though.

36:22.794 --> 36:27.047
All them cornfields
and ballet in the evening.

36:27.174 --> 36:30.219
I wish I knew as much about it
as you do.

36:30.344 --> 36:32.846
Er... you haven't read
any of Lenin's work, have you?

36:32.972 --> 36:35.892
Erm... no, I’m afraid I haven't.

36:36.017 --> 36:37.602
That will open your eyes for you.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.437
ls he still on about Russia?

36:39.565 --> 36:42.818
I’ll tell you straight: that's all
we ever get to hear in this house.

36:42.943 --> 36:45.279
- Have another cup of tea, Mr Windrush.
- Er... no, I won't, thank you very much.

36:45.405 --> 36:48.199
- No!
- Perhaps you'd care to imbibe.

36:48.324 --> 36:50.660
Mother. Where's that
Australian burgundy we had?

36:50.786 --> 36:52.245
- Where is it? It's in the...
- No, really.

36:52.371 --> 36:54.123
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely certain.

36:54.248 --> 36:57.251
Cynthia, this is Mr Windrush.

36:57.378 --> 36:59.628
You know, the gentleman
that's going to take the room.

36:59.755 --> 37:01.006
Yes, we have met already.-

37:01.132 --> 37:03.676
- Good evening.
- There's some tea for you.

37:03.802 --> 37:05.886
No, I can't stop.
I’m off now.

37:06.014 --> 37:08.056
Well, where are you going this evening,
for goodness' sake, then?

37:08.182 --> 37:11.102
- Movies.
- Well, I’ve got my car outside.

37:11.227 --> 37:13.146
- Perhaps I could give you a lift.
- Well...

37:13.272 --> 37:16.025
That would be kind,
wouldn't it, Cynthia?

37:16.151 --> 37:18.777
Yes. Ta.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.947
Here, you don't want to go yet,
Stanley, do you?

37:21.073 --> 37:23.784
Erm, well, I don't, but I really
ought to be getting along now, Mr Kite.

37:25.077 --> 37:27.538
- Bye, Mum!
- Bye-bye, dear. Don't be late.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.833
- Dad...
- Well, goodbye. Thank you very much.

37:29.959 --> 37:32.211
No, don't worry, Mrs Kite.
We'll see ourselves out.

37:35.634 --> 37:38.844
What a lovely young fellow, eh?
Ain't he well mannered.

37:38.970 --> 37:40.805
And potentially very intelligent.

37:40.930 --> 37:43.266
Yes.
I don't know anything about that.

37:43.392 --> 37:46.854
You know, Mother,
it's a pity Cynthia don't read a bit.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.106
That girl's not properly developed.

37:49.233 --> 37:53.570
Not properly developed?
Whatever on earth are you talking about?

37:53.697 --> 37:55.238
Intellectually, I mean.

37:55.366 --> 37:58.369
Oh, well, she's young.
She wants a bit of fun.

37:58.494 --> 38:00.370
Yes, and she makes sure she gets it.

38:00.497 --> 38:02.206
You know, I was thinking,
him living here

38:02.333 --> 38:04.417
might make
a very good friend for Cynthia.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.713
After all, he is a gentleman.
You can trust his sort.

38:09.883 --> 38:11.176
Please explain.

38:11.301 --> 38:14.262
Well, Mr Mohammed,
I’m afraid there's a distinct possibility

38:14.389 --> 38:18.726
that Missiles will be unable
to fulfill your contract.

38:18.852 --> 38:22.105
But you're joking. The peace
of the Middle East depends on it.

38:22.232 --> 38:24.984
No, I’m not joking.

38:25.110 --> 38:27.195
Cox, perhaps
you would explain to Mr Mohammed.

38:27.321 --> 38:31.241
Well, there's an engineering concern
that I happen to own.

38:31.368 --> 38:34.913
I own the shares
and Bertie owns the tax losses...

38:35.039 --> 38:37.916
only they're not in his name, of course.

38:38.043 --> 38:39.585
Well, erm...

38:39.712 --> 38:42.715
we don't happen to be very busy
just at the moment.

38:42.841 --> 38:45.843
That is unfortunate, but the contract
is already with Missiles.

38:45.969 --> 38:48.972
Yes, but, then, supposing Bertie's right
and they can't deliver?

38:49.098 --> 38:50.224
You want a rush job.

38:50.349 --> 38:52.810
Well, that's where
my little company comes in.

38:52.936 --> 38:55.479
Only, of course, it's going to cost
your government a bit more.

38:55.606 --> 38:57.649
About 100,000 pounds more.

38:57.775 --> 39:00.361
Well, that's a nice little sum
to divide between three.

39:00.487 --> 39:01.904
Eeny,

39:02.030 --> 39:03.740
meeny,

39:03.866 --> 39:04.907
miny.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.959
I see!

39:12.084 --> 39:18.215
Between simple businessmen,
Mr Mohammed, even peace is divisible.

39:18.342 --> 39:20.051
But why should you have trouble
at Missiles?

39:20.178 --> 39:22.429
A new worker
we've just taken on...

39:22.556 --> 39:24.640
Shocking troublemaker,
Mr Mohammed.

39:24.767 --> 39:26.392
Never knows when to stop.

39:46.835 --> 39:48.294
Stan...

39:49.214 --> 39:50.672
Mm-hm...

39:52.008 --> 39:55.179
Do you mind me asking you something?

39:55.304 --> 39:57.348
Of course not.

39:58.266 --> 40:00.811
Cross your heart?

40:00.936 --> 40:03.313
Cross my heart.

40:03.439 --> 40:05.525
Are them your own teeth?

40:08.654 --> 40:10.489
Are they what?

40:10.615 --> 40:13.492
Are them your own teeth?

40:13.618 --> 40:15.703
Well, of course they are.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.415
I thought they were somehow.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.085
Only you keep them so nice and white,

40:21.211 --> 40:23.296
it just crossed my mind
they might be dentures.

40:30.347 --> 40:32.140
Stan!

40:32.266 --> 40:33.892
Mm-hm...

40:34.853 --> 40:37.355
I’m so glad you're coming to live with us.

Come on, squire.
What's the trouble?

41:26.792 --> 41:28.793
The damned thing won't go.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.211
You've done it now.

41:30.338 --> 41:32.006
You forgot to plug in, didn't you?

41:32.131 --> 41:35.301
I saw that last night.
And when Charlie saw it, he said...

41:35.427 --> 41:38.555
he said, "There's a bloke who'll have
a flat battery in the morning," he said.

41:42.770 --> 41:45.188
Well, if he saw the plug was out,
why the devil didn't he put it in?

41:45.315 --> 41:46.982
Demarcation, Stan.

41:47.107 --> 41:49.945
Demarcation?
What the blazes is demarcation?

41:50.070 --> 41:53.823
Not his job. He mustn't go doing work
that belongs to other people, must he?

41:53.951 --> 41:56.327
I thought we workers
were all solid together.

41:56.453 --> 42:00.415
Squire, you need educating.
He's in a different union.

42:00.541 --> 42:02.877
He's in the Amalgamated.
We're in the General.

42:03.002 --> 42:05.046
Well, what's the point
in having two unions?

42:05.172 --> 42:06.673
Blimey, when was you born?

42:06.800 --> 42:08.550
How would we go on for wage claims?

42:08.677 --> 42:11.513
The Amalgamated gets a rise,
so the General puts in for one.

42:11.638 --> 42:14.475
If the General gets it, then
the Amalgamated starts all over again.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.602
So it goes on, you see, like leapfrog.

42:16.727 --> 42:19.105
Otherwise we wouldn't none of us
get a rise, would we?

42:19.649 --> 42:20.899
I see...

42:21.025 --> 42:22.609
I hate to mention
a horrible thing like work.

42:22.735 --> 42:25.279
Would you two mind
getting your trucks out on the job?

42:40.924 --> 42:44.386
Put it back and plug it in.

42:44.512 --> 42:46.597
Get a spare.

43:49.383 --> 43:52.011
Here's the box you had
put in the recreation room, sir.

43:52.136 --> 43:54.222
All right, Henry. Leave it there.

44:17.210 --> 44:19.294
Ooh... Very good.

44:29.641 --> 44:31.726
The dirty beast!

44:35.148 --> 44:38.526
Major! I’m sorry,
but I really cannot go on like this.

44:38.652 --> 44:40.154
- Yes?
- Your idea that I should keep out of sight

44:40.279 --> 44:43.198
and time these men through binoculars
is quite impossible.

44:45.035 --> 44:47.620
Waters, listen to this.
This is very good.

44:47.746 --> 44:51.625
"Re that prize bloodhound
with binoculars which watches us,

44:51.751 --> 44:54.671
"we suggest you don't let him
come sniffing round the workshops

44:54.796 --> 44:56.798
"or he might lose his testimonials.

44:56.925 --> 44:59.510
"Signed, Four Dog Lovers."

44:59.636 --> 45:01.430
I don't find that particularly amusing.

45:01.555 --> 45:04.141
I say, you ought to see
some of the others. Sheer porno.

45:04.267 --> 45:07.270
Still, I suppose if it weren't for this box
they'd be writing all over the walls.

45:13.737 --> 45:15.821
Hello. Hitchcock, Personnel.

45:17.575 --> 45:20.536
Hello, sir.

45:20.662 --> 45:23.624
Well, of course.
Yes, yes. Good show.

45:24.334 --> 45:26.418
Henry, come in here!

45:26.544 --> 45:27.587
What...?

45:27.712 --> 45:30.965
leave that to me, sir.
I’ll lay that on.

45:32.010 --> 45:34.094
Goodbye, sir.

45:34.721 --> 45:35.972
Blast!

45:36.556 --> 45:38.141
Henry. Bit of a flap on.

45:38.266 --> 45:40.268
The deputy chairman's bringing down
that bunch of darkies

45:40.395 --> 45:41.770
we're doing this contract for.

45:41.897 --> 45:43.356
Got to lay on the usual things.

45:43.482 --> 45:45.691
You know, speeches in the canteen
after lunch,

45:45.818 --> 45:48.195
clean towels,
little bit of soap in the toilet.

45:48.321 --> 45:49.822
Well, go on, mush!

45:49.948 --> 45:52.617
- By the way, he wants to see you.
- Who? Me?

45:52.743 --> 45:54.995
Yes, you must report to him
directly he arrives.

45:55.121 --> 45:58.249
Right...

45:58.375 --> 46:01.044
I had you sent down here
to do a job, Waters,

46:01.170 --> 46:02.295
and you're simply not doing it.

46:02.422 --> 46:04.715
But nobody will cooperate, sir,
least of all Major Hitchcock.

46:04.841 --> 46:06.175
Now listen to me, Waters.

46:06.301 --> 46:10.222
If you want cooperation,
get hold of that new man, Windrush.

46:10.349 --> 46:13.434
He's on the trucks.
He's young, keen, intelligent...

46:13.559 --> 46:15.688
and he hasn't been corrupted. Yet.

46:15.813 --> 46:19.316
Well, sir, I could start timing
the mechanical handling if you'd like that.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.778
Good. Well, after lunch,
get down to Dispatch.

46:21.904 --> 46:23.864
I’ve told Crawley
to have him working there.

46:23.990 --> 46:25.533
But what about
the works committee?

46:25.659 --> 46:29.329
Well, as you know, Waters,
I’m addressing the workmen at lunchtime

46:29.454 --> 46:32.416
and what I have to say is bound
to provoke a works committee meeting.

46:32.543 --> 46:34.502
My guess is they'll be out of the way.

46:34.628 --> 46:37.630
- Very well, sir. Thank you very much, sir.
- Get on with it.

46:44.098 --> 46:46.600
Very nice, Bertram. Very nice indeed.

46:46.726 --> 46:49.604
Young, keen, and intelligent. Blimey!

46:49.730 --> 46:52.482
You'd better hop it now. I don't want
the other directors to see you here.

46:52.608 --> 46:54.067
Right. Look, in that speech of yours,

46:54.193 --> 46:56.696
give 'em plenty of the old
"working your fingers to the bone" stuff.

46:56.822 --> 47:01.285
And don't forget all that bunk
about export or die.

47:01.411 --> 47:05.123
Export or die
is no empty phrase.

47:05.249 --> 47:08.544
If we cannot sell the things we produce,
we cannot buy the things we need.

47:08.669 --> 47:10.713
The result will be starvation.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.718
I wonder if there's anyone here
who can put his hand on his heart

47:14.844 --> 47:16.678
and truly say,

47:16.804 --> 47:19.474
"I am doing my best."

47:19.600 --> 47:21.852
The greatness of this...

47:21.977 --> 47:24.772
Turn it down, Charlie boy.
There's enough wind inside.

47:24.899 --> 47:27.317
...honesty. Hard work
and a sense of duty.

47:27.443 --> 47:30.195
An ideal which many, I’m afraid,
have rather lost sight of.

47:30.989 --> 47:35.952
To ensure this country's healthy
trading intercourse with foreign markets,

47:36.078 --> 47:37.913
we must sell at the right price.

47:38.039 --> 47:40.499
What's he on about, Stan?

47:40.626 --> 47:42.377
Commercial intercourse
with foreigners.

47:42.503 --> 47:44.338
...any notion of slackness,

47:44.463 --> 47:48.885
demands greater efficiency
and everyone doing an honest day's work

47:49.011 --> 47:52.515
for a fair day's pay, for a change.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.686
lt means that we must be ready
to work with our neighbours,

47:56.812 --> 47:59.272
irrespective of whether
they share our beliefs

47:59.399 --> 48:02.110
or whether they belong to another union,
or to another race.

48:02.235 --> 48:06.365
For the success of the firm
is the success of us all.

48:09.035 --> 48:10.537
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

48:10.662 --> 48:13.832
And now get back
and buckle down to your jobs.

48:24.138 --> 48:26.390
A very excellent speech, Mr Tracepurcel.

48:26.515 --> 48:29.143
It's so nice for me to see
British democracy in action.

48:29.269 --> 48:30.562
Well, thank you, my dear fellow.

48:30.687 --> 48:32.230
Jolly good speech, I must say.

48:32.355 --> 48:34.567
Creep!

48:34.692 --> 48:37.820
Well, Hitchcock, I think my speech
should have quite an effect, eh?

48:37.946 --> 48:39.990
I should be most surprised
if it didn't, sir.

49:02.810 --> 49:04.769
- Afternoon!
- Afternoon!

49:04.896 --> 49:08.024
- Are you in charge here?
- No, you want the dispatch charge hand.

49:08.150 --> 49:09.359
He should be back soon.

49:09.485 --> 49:11.111
He's a shop steward and they've got
a works committee meeting on.

49:11.237 --> 49:13.906
Ah... Handy little machine
you've got here.

49:14.033 --> 49:15.407
Yes, they're jolly good, aren't they?

49:15.534 --> 49:17.702
I know you'll think me an awful fool,
but I'm a new boy around here.

49:17.828 --> 49:19.455
Really?
I haven't been here long myself.

49:19.580 --> 49:21.790
Yes?
What are you doing exactly?

49:21.917 --> 49:25.253
Well, I’m shifting these generators
from the stores to here for loading up.

49:25.379 --> 49:26.923
You must find this machine
saves you a lot of sweat.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.423
lt certainly does.

49:28.550 --> 49:31.094
Pity it can't take more than one crate
at a time.

49:31.220 --> 49:33.889
- But it can.
- Oh! Really?

49:34.015 --> 49:35.265
Yes.

49:35.391 --> 49:37.185
- Would you like me to show you?
- I would indeed.

49:37.310 --> 49:38.895
Righty-oh.
Now you stay here.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.064
Mind your legs,
the back swings round a bit.

49:41.191 --> 49:43.275
That's the idea.

50:01.924 --> 50:03.926
- There we are!
- My goodness, that was quick.

50:04.052 --> 50:06.846
Not really. I could go
much faster than that if I wanted to.

50:06.972 --> 50:09.558
- But not with two, surely?
- More than two. Three. Four, if you like.

50:09.684 --> 50:12.812
- That's impossible.
- All right, I’ll show you.

50:17.067 --> 50:19.194
I say... Are you sure I'm not keeping you
from your work?

50:19.320 --> 50:20.446
No, no, no!

50:20.572 --> 50:22.282
Wouldn't like to get you
into trouble, or anything.

50:22.408 --> 50:26.203
- Especially as you're new here.
- Not at all. I’m learning a lot.

50:26.329 --> 50:29.541
Good!
Right! Watch this!

50:35.591 --> 50:37.675
Don't want to get you into trouble.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.596
Brothers, it means trouble. You all
heard what was said in his speech.

50:40.722 --> 50:41.805
- We did, Brother Chair.
- We, did Fred.

50:41.932 --> 50:44.851
I have no hesitation
in categorically delineating it

50:44.977 --> 50:47.104
as being barefaced provocative
of the workers.

50:47.229 --> 50:48.522
Hear, hear!

50:48.648 --> 50:51.568
On a point of order, Brother Chair,
I would say we was left with no option.

50:51.693 --> 50:52.777
Exactly, brother.

50:52.903 --> 50:54.362
Up to now we've been
bending over backwards

50:54.488 --> 50:57.992
trying to be helpful to the management,
but the cooperation's been all one-sided.

50:58.118 --> 51:01.747
You're right.
They f-f-f-f-fight us on every issue.

51:01.873 --> 51:04.291
Correct. Now, if I am to ascertain
the sense of this meeting,

51:04.418 --> 51:05.877
from now on no concessions.

51:06.003 --> 51:08.380
Every man in this factory's got
quite enough on his plate as it is

51:08.505 --> 51:10.716
without having any more piled on.

51:25.903 --> 51:28.488
There we are. Dead easy.

51:31.493 --> 51:33.787
Splendid! Absolutely first rate.

51:33.912 --> 51:35.997
I shall want them put into effect
immediately.

51:36.123 --> 51:37.666
Certainly, sir.

51:37.793 --> 51:40.336
Actually, nobody told me
the shop stewards

51:40.462 --> 51:43.965
- had agreed to the re-timings of the job.
- They haven't.

51:44.092 --> 51:47.595
Well, sir, with all due respect,
these figures are absolutely worthless.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.598
- Why?
- Why? Waters knows as well as I do

51:50.724 --> 51:53.185
that you must actually time a man
on the job.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.355
A man was timed.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.817
A man was? How? Who?

51:58.943 --> 52:01.028
Quite an inexperienced operator.

52:01.154 --> 52:04.991
- I’m surprised to hear that.
- New man, sir. Name's Windrush.

52:05.118 --> 52:08.453
Windrush? Windrush.

52:08.579 --> 52:10.581
Look, sir, I...
I don't want to be a Jeremiah,

52:10.707 --> 52:13.960
but most of these figures
are absolute science fiction, sir.

52:14.087 --> 52:16.088
There's no fiction
about those figures, Major.

52:16.214 --> 52:19.591
ln point of fact, Windrush's rate of work
is much higher.

52:19.719 --> 52:20.760
Yes, but he's a new man.

52:20.886 --> 52:23.180
He hasn't got used to the natural rhythm
of the other workers.

52:23.305 --> 52:25.850
What you call their natural rhythm of work
is neither natural, rhythmic

52:25.977 --> 52:28.186
or anything very much to do with work.

52:28.312 --> 52:30.105
I agree.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.357
Absolutely, sir.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.568
Right, take 'em away
and get on with it.

52:36.740 --> 52:39.951
This is just the sort of thing I had in mind
when I decided to have you down here.

52:40.076 --> 52:42.954
- Keep it up!
- Thank you, sir. I’ll do my best.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.498
Before long we'll really have things
moving in this place.

52:45.625 --> 52:46.667
Er...

53:41.444 --> 53:44.989
- Slice of cake?
- What? Turn you stone deaf.

53:45.114 --> 53:49.327
Last week I was skint, then I had three
cross doubles, and all of them came up.

53:49.454 --> 53:51.997
No...
Turn it up!

53:52.123 --> 53:54.208
The boys will get the impression
you're creeping.

53:54.335 --> 53:56.503
Sorry!

53:56.629 --> 53:58.463
Here you are, squire,
a nice cup of gnats'.

53:58.590 --> 54:00.716
- Here...
- No, go on, have this one on me.

54:00.843 --> 54:03.553
Otherwise we'll have old Kitey chasing
you for the rent at the weekend.

54:07.226 --> 54:09.853
There you are, look. Told you.
He's come to collect.

54:09.979 --> 54:13.649
Fall in, the Church Lads' Brigade.
Come on.

54:14.401 --> 54:16.486
Thank you, brother.

54:21.493 --> 54:24.829
Right, brothers, are we all gathered?

54:24.956 --> 54:29.335
My purpose in convening you
is to lay before you certain facts.

54:29.461 --> 54:31.254
A few minutes ago,
I was handed this paper

54:31.380 --> 54:33.673
by a representative of the management.

54:33.800 --> 54:37.596
lt purports to contain certain timings
made by the management,

54:37.721 --> 54:41.017
which directly affect the rates
for the job that you are doing.

54:41.142 --> 54:44.103
Now, this is the first time that this has
been mooted to the works committee,

54:44.229 --> 54:47.566
And everything about it constitutes
quite definitely, quite definitely...

54:47.692 --> 54:49.610
a definite breach of the existing
agreements

54:49.736 --> 54:51.571
that exist between
management and unions.

54:51.696 --> 54:54.158
- A diabolical liberty.
- Hear, hear!

54:54.283 --> 54:57.828
How could they have retimed the job
without any one of us knowing?

54:57.954 --> 54:58.996
Correct, brother.

54:59.122 --> 55:00.248
And that brings me to a point

55:00.373 --> 55:04.127
that has led us to take a particularly
grave view of the matter in hand.

55:04.254 --> 55:07.590
My information is that
one of our members did, in fact,

55:07.717 --> 55:11.470
cooperate with the management.

55:11.596 --> 55:15.308
Brother Windrush. I am obliged
to put to you an open question.

55:15.434 --> 55:19.313
Did you or did you not, in fact,
collaborate with the management?

55:19.439 --> 55:23.318
Me? Collaborate? What do you mean?

55:23.444 --> 55:25.320
Was you on loadings
yesterday afternoon?

55:25.447 --> 55:26.614
Yes.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.701
Brother Jackson, you're in charge
of loadings. Where was you?

55:29.826 --> 55:33.164
Between the hours referred to
I was at a shop stewards' meeting.

55:33.289 --> 55:34.957
So, you were there alone, brother.

55:35.084 --> 55:37.961
Yes, I was.
Except for the other chap.

55:38.088 --> 55:39.672
The other chap!

55:39.798 --> 55:42.968
I think you ought to know, brothers,
that this so-called other chap

55:43.093 --> 55:45.220
was, in point of fact,
the new time and motion man.

55:45.346 --> 55:47.013
- That's torn it.
- That's handy.

55:47.139 --> 55:49.392
What, old Soapy?

55:49.518 --> 55:53.313
Brother Windrush, perhaps you'd care
to make a statement about that.

55:53.438 --> 55:56.024
I’m terribly sorry,
but he didn't tell me that.

55:56.150 --> 55:57.651
He just said that he was new here.

55:57.778 --> 56:01.323
You must be dead stupid.
Of course he wasn't going to tell you.

56:01.449 --> 56:03.367
lt was just that he was
so interested in the truck.

56:03.493 --> 56:06.121
Well, all he's interested in
is more work for less money.

56:06.247 --> 56:08.039
But I wasn't working particularly hard,

56:08.165 --> 56:09.917
and I got the job done in half the time.

56:10.042 --> 56:12.294
Well, at that rate,
you'd only need half the drivers.

56:12.422 --> 56:13.963
You want your head seen to.

56:14.090 --> 56:17.926
It's all right for you, matey,
but we need the money.

56:18.053 --> 56:20.805
So do I.
ln fact, I could do with a bit more.

56:20.931 --> 56:24.143
Huh. You're going the right bleeding way
about getting it. No mistake.

56:24.269 --> 56:27.939
- You s-s-s-silly c-c-c-c-clot.
- Hear, hear!

56:28.065 --> 56:29.441
You can say that again.

56:29.567 --> 56:30.693
Order, brothers, order.

56:30.818 --> 56:34.530
Windrush, your case will come up tonight
before the branch for consideration.

56:34.657 --> 56:38.785
Well, I would like to make it clear
that I was not working hard.

56:38.911 --> 56:40.038
Just quicker!

56:40.163 --> 56:43.666
Looking at those schedules here, I’d say
you was working like a ruddy black.

56:43.793 --> 56:45.711
'Ere... that's it.

56:45.837 --> 56:48.673
You all heard what was said in the speech
about working with coloured labour.

56:48.798 --> 56:50.175
The next thing you know,
we'll have the blacks here

56:50.301 --> 56:52.802
doing our jobs like they do
on the buses in Birmingham.

56:52.929 --> 56:54.929
- Dirty rotten trick!
- Typical!

56:55.057 --> 56:57.601
What are you going to do, Kitey?
Call the drivers out?

56:57.726 --> 57:01.646
Call the drivers out? I tell you, brothers,
everybody's coming out.

57:01.774 --> 57:03.483
Hear, hear!

57:42.657 --> 57:44.241
Hey, you!
You're in the loading bay, aren't you?

57:44.367 --> 57:46.494
- Has that fellow Windrush gone yet?
- Try the car park.

57:46.620 --> 57:48.663
He's got one of them bubble cars.

57:58.635 --> 58:01.929
ls your name...?
Good lord, it is.

58:02.056 --> 58:03.723
Of course I know you.

58:03.849 --> 58:05.768
That's right,
I served under you in the army.

58:05.893 --> 58:07.853
- How are you, sir?
- I might have known it.

58:07.980 --> 58:11.065
You were damn bolshie in the army, and
now you're trying the same thing here.

58:11.192 --> 58:13.277
But sir, what do you mean?

58:13.403 --> 58:14.445
What do I mean?

58:14.571 --> 58:16.029
Don't come the innocent
with me, Windrush.

58:16.157 --> 58:18.449
You haven't been here more than five
minutes, and the whole place is on strike.

58:18.576 --> 58:20.828
- But sir...
- You're a positive shower.

58:20.954 --> 58:22.831
A stinker of the first order.

58:22.956 --> 58:25.667
I’m frightfully sorry, sir,
but I’m going to have to leave.

58:28.045 --> 58:30.173
Ow!

58:52.826 --> 58:54.703
- Here, come on. We're on strike.
- Who said so?

58:54.828 --> 58:56.914
- Old Kitey has just passed a motion.
- Since when, man?

58:57.040 --> 58:59.125
Half an hour ago. Come on!

58:59.250 --> 59:02.962
Here, come on, pack it in. There's no
point us working for nothing, is there?

59:08.679 --> 59:11.264
Well, here's to the solidarity
of the workers.

59:11.390 --> 59:14.268
Long may they remain united.

59:14.394 --> 59:17.606
I think we can be pretty sure
that the workers won't give in.

59:17.731 --> 59:21.611
The only thing is that my fellow directors
may not approve of the stand I’ve taken.

59:21.737 --> 59:22.946
And if they do not?

59:23.072 --> 59:25.783
Then I might have to withdraw
the schedules,

59:25.908 --> 59:27.576
and the strike would collapse.

59:27.702 --> 59:29.454
But it must not collapse.

59:29.579 --> 59:32.165
I have to have time to get permission
to transfer the contract

59:32.291 --> 59:33.625
to my friend Mr Cox here.

59:33.751 --> 59:35.460
Well, how long would you like,
Mr Mohammed?

59:35.587 --> 59:37.381
Four or five days. A least.

59:37.506 --> 59:40.717
I daresay I could manage that.

59:40.843 --> 59:42.928
Do you know, Bertie, I...

59:43.055 --> 59:46.599
I think perhaps we ought to call
the newspapers in on this.

59:46.726 --> 59:50.896
I can't help feeling there's a nice,
warm, human story here somewhere.

01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:05.915
You haven't finished.
Come on, Stanley,

01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:09.003
you can't stop eating just because
you're not working, you know?

01:00:09.128 --> 01:00:13.174
- My dear boy!
- I say, Mr Kite's quite late, isn't he?

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.929
Soppy branch meetings.
Jaw, jaw, jaw.

01:00:17.054 --> 01:00:18.764
I don't know
what they find to talk about.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.392
They're talking about me, I think!
Considering my case.

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:23.603
Daft lot!

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.188
There he is now.

01:00:25.316 --> 01:00:27.233
Come on, Dad!

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:28.943
Tea's waiting.

01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:32.448
Stanley and Cynthia's
practically finished theirs.

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.793
Good evening, Mother.

01:00:48.634 --> 01:00:51.263
Good evening, Mr Kite.

01:00:51.388 --> 01:00:54.058
Communication addressed to you
from the branch committee.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.268
- Good evening, Cynthia.
- Dad...

01:01:08.743 --> 01:01:11.913
"Disassociation"? What's that?

01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:14.332
You have been sent to Coventry.

01:01:14.459 --> 01:01:17.586
You mean... nobody will talk to me
for a month?

01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:19.798
That is correct, yes.

01:01:22.927 --> 01:01:25.471
Does that mean that you're not even
allowed to talk to me, Mr Kite?

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:28.849
Only to inform you of the nature
of the branch committee's decision,

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:31.144
democratically arrived at.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:34.065
Demo... but I wasn't there, Mr Kite!

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.735
Utterly unnecessary.
We was in full possession of all the facts.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.780
So, you've all come out again, eh?

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:42.534
Jolly good job
the wives don't go out on strike.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.787
- You washed your hands?
- They're clean enough, Mother.

01:01:44.912 --> 01:01:47.998
Yes, well, I hope they are.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.875
Here, who can that be?

01:01:54.507 --> 01:01:56.884
- Yes?
- Good evening. ls this Mr Kite's house?

01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:59.930
- Yes.
- We're from the press.

01:02:00.056 --> 01:02:05.437
From the press.
Would you wait one moment, please?

01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:08.899
Dad!

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.527
Dad!-

01:02:10.652 --> 01:02:12.112
- It's the newspapers.
- What?

01:02:12.238 --> 01:02:16.992
- There's a crowd of reporters outside.
- That'll be about the strike.

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:18.786
No doubt they want a statement from me.

01:02:18.913 --> 01:02:21.957
I wouldn't go getting myself
in the newspapers if I were you.

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:23.667
Don't be silly, Mother.
When you're in the public eye,

01:02:23.794 --> 01:02:25.627
you must expect that sort of thing.

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:27.380
Let them in.

01:02:27.965 --> 01:02:33.180
I must ask all those present to retire
while I hold a press conference.

01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:42.065
Press conference? Huh? Who do you
think you are? Diana Dors?

01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:44.776
- Will you come in, please?
- Good evening.

01:02:44.903 --> 01:02:46.488
- Good evening.
- Good evening, friends.

01:02:46.613 --> 01:02:48.990
- Good evening.
- Please be seated.

01:02:49.116 --> 01:02:51.035
- Mr Kite?
- That is correct, friend, yes.

01:02:51.161 --> 01:02:53.037
I think I know
what you've all come about,

01:02:53.163 --> 01:02:55.039
so if you'd care to
take the seats available,

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:58.043
I’m quite prepared to get down
to the facts of the case.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.963
Now, the situation as I see it is this:

01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:02.798
- lt has always been the union's...
- Mr Kite...

01:03:02.925 --> 01:03:04.635
Could we interrupt you
just for a moment?

01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:06.720
Certainly, friend. Certainly.

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:09.182
We understand
you have a Mr Windrush lodging with you.

01:03:09.308 --> 01:03:11.059
That is so, yes.

01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:13.896
Could we see him,
do you think, Mr Kite?

01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:16.650
See him?

01:03:16.775 --> 01:03:18.151
Well, I do not know.

01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:19.695
ls he in?

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.657
Yes, he's in...

01:03:22.783 --> 01:03:24.951
but it may not be convenient.

01:03:25.078 --> 01:03:26.203
Would you mind asking him?

01:03:33.128 --> 01:03:34.587
Mother!

01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:37.676
Mr Kite, this strike at Missiles.

01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:40.095
I believe you're chief shop steward,
aren't you?

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.930
I am... for my sins.

01:03:42.056 --> 01:03:44.267
Then it was you
who brought the men out?

01:03:44.393 --> 01:03:46.644
Technically that might appear so.

01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:51.025
However, a motion was put and passed
democratically, and if I might...

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:54.320
How many strikes have you called
in the last year, Mr Kite?

01:03:54.446 --> 01:03:59.535
Now, now. I do not regard that question
as being revelant to the immediate issues.

01:03:59.662 --> 01:04:02.539
Are you a member
of any political party, Mr Kite?

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:04.542
Friend, my politics are a matter

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:07.461
between my conscience
and the ballot box.

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:09.965
Well, are you a Conservative, then?

01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:13.093
Look here, friend,
the interests of the working classes

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:17.348
are historically and diametrically opposed
to those vested interests

01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:19.977
which lay behind the party
you have mentioned.

01:04:20.103 --> 01:04:22.397
What is more, and again...

01:04:22.522 --> 01:04:24.065
Do you mind if we ask you
some questions, Mr Windrush?

01:04:24.191 --> 01:04:26.611
No, not at all. Of course.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:30.698
This strike at Missiles, Mr Windrush.
We're told you started it.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:33.827
- Yes, I’m afraid I did.
- By working too hard.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.079
Well, I wouldn't say that.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.166
But you did work a lot harder
than the others?

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:42.713
Well... not harder, really.
Perhaps a bit quicker.

01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:45.008
What are your mates
going to say about this?

01:04:45.134 --> 01:04:47.303
I’m not quite sure, really.

01:04:47.428 --> 01:04:49.221
You see,
they're not allowed to speak to me.

01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:51.808
- Why not?
- Well, I’ve been sent to Coventry.

01:04:51.933 --> 01:04:54.144
Sent to Coventry for working hard?

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:57.940
I suppose so.
I'm not quite sure, really.

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:00.234
These mates of yours.
How do you feel about them?

01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:01.904
They're first-class chaps.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.197
No hard feelings?

01:05:03.323 --> 01:05:04.866
Good Lord, no.

01:05:04.991 --> 01:05:07.035
But don't you want to get back to work?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.870
Yes, I do, I...

01:05:08.996 --> 01:05:11.874
- I need the money.
- But the union's stopping you?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.044
Yes, well...

01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:16.672
It's not really as simple
as all that, really.

01:05:16.798 --> 01:05:19.592
You see,
there's the negotiated agreement,

01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:22.470
and then there's also the question
of the black men.

01:05:22.597 --> 01:05:25.265
Black men?
How do they come into it?

01:05:25.392 --> 01:05:28.978
Well, I must admit
I don't really understand that myself.

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:31.189
But I’m sure Mr Kite
could explain it for you.

01:05:32.192 --> 01:05:33.818
Would it be fair to say, Mr Windrush,

01:05:33.944 --> 01:05:36.988
that your whole object is
to help get this big export order completed

01:05:37.115 --> 01:05:39.866
- as quickly as possible?
- Absolutely.

01:05:39.992 --> 01:05:44.123
I think we all realise that if we can't
export, we shall die of starvation.

01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:46.666
And I mean,
we must produce the goods

01:05:46.793 --> 01:05:49.713
- at the right price, mustn't we?
- Do forgive me, Mr Windrush,

01:05:49.839 --> 01:05:53.926
but I’m most anxious to get
the human angle on this sort of problem.

01:05:54.052 --> 01:05:56.513
Are you the only person living here
with Mr and Mrs Kite?

01:05:56.638 --> 01:06:00.350
Yes, that's right. I mean,
apart from their daughter Cynthia.

01:06:01.937 --> 01:06:04.731
- And what does she do?
- She's at the factory, too.

01:06:04.857 --> 01:06:07.150
Really? Mm...

01:06:07.277 --> 01:06:10.404
Then you must be seeing
quite a lot of each other?

01:06:11.282 --> 01:06:14.451
Yes, well... It's really getting
awfully late, now and I...

01:06:14.577 --> 01:06:16.620
Mr Kite hasn't had his supper yet.

01:06:16.747 --> 01:06:18.622
- Thank you very much.
- Before we go, Mr Windrush,

01:06:18.749 --> 01:06:21.000
could we have a picture of you
with Mrs Kite and her daughter?

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:23.712
Just over here, Mr Windrush.
Next to Mrs Kite!

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:25.715
You don't want to photograph me!

01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:27.843
What do you want to
photograph me for?

01:06:27.968 --> 01:06:30.471
Give us a chance
to get my apron off, then.

01:06:30.597 --> 01:06:32.056
Let's make it a little more friendly.

01:06:32.182 --> 01:06:33.516
Put your arms round them,
Mr Windrush.

01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.935
That's it.

01:06:36.061 --> 01:06:38.521
Now, Miss Kite,
if you'll just look up at Mr Windrush and...

01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:39.690
smile.

01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:41.984
Thank you.

01:06:43.321 --> 01:06:45.489
"- Salute Stanley Windrush.
- Why?

01:06:45.616 --> 01:06:49.494
"Because this man did in one hour
what his workmates did in several.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.246
"What did his union do?

01:06:51.371 --> 01:06:53.665
"They sent him to Coventry.

01:06:53.793 --> 01:06:55.375
"Was he working too hard?

01:06:55.503 --> 01:06:59.215
"No! He was working more
efficientry... efficiently.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.675
"What a reward!
Does he forgive them?

01:07:01.802 --> 01:07:03.136
"Yes, he does.

01:07:03.261 --> 01:07:05.472
"'They are first class chaps,' he says.

01:07:05.598 --> 01:07:08.225
"Here is an example to us all.

01:07:08.352 --> 01:07:10.812
"The management must back this man."

01:07:10.938 --> 01:07:13.398
There. Lord Beaverbrook wrote that.

01:07:13.525 --> 01:07:15.527
I should never have allowed him
to be interviewed.

01:07:15.652 --> 01:07:18.488
They was bound to use him
as a tool to whitewash the bosses.

01:07:18.614 --> 01:07:20.532
This is a stunt of the management's.

01:07:20.659 --> 01:07:22.159
Look at this, Mum.

01:07:22.285 --> 01:07:24.787
"The Sketch" says...
if Stan was working in Russia

01:07:24.914 --> 01:07:26.832
he'd be made a hero of the Soviet Union.

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:30.210
Ooh, you've come out lovely
in this one, Cyn.

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:33.631
I must say,
they do look nice together, Dad.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.300
Look at Stan in this one.

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:37.886
He looks just like
Frankie Sinatra. Innit marvelous!

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:40.013
Beats me how you can sit there
reading that muck!

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.934
I don't know about muck.

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:44.436
You have sent him into Coventry,
haven't you?

01:07:44.563 --> 01:07:47.439
I notice they don't say,
"Salute Fred Kite."

01:07:47.567 --> 01:07:49.526
Your press conference
didn't do you much good, did it?

01:07:49.652 --> 01:07:51.403
Don't be rude to your father now.

01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:54.824
- Well, I’d better be off.
- Thought you said you wasn't working?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.869
I can't stay here arguing.
I've got a lot to do.

01:07:56.995 --> 01:07:59.329
Report to the executives,
check up on the pickets.

01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:02.083
From what I can see, the only time
you everjolly well do any work's

01:08:02.209 --> 01:08:04.460
when you're on strike.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.557
- There he is!
- Ah...

01:08:14.683 --> 01:08:16.768
Mind your backs, please.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.272
Any further developments, Mr Kite?
Care to make a statement?

01:08:20.398 --> 01:08:21.814
Any news?

01:08:22.774 --> 01:08:25.154
I have only one thing to say
to you lot.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.948
This strike is going to be
one hundred per cent solid.

01:08:28.073 --> 01:08:30.951
Apart from that, I have no comment.

01:08:31.078 --> 01:08:34.497
Excuse me.
Stand back, please. Stand back.

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:48.057
Keep a look-out
for Master Stanley's car, Truscott.

01:08:48.182 --> 01:08:51.018
I imagine the house
must be somewhere near here.

01:08:51.144 --> 01:08:52.435
Very good, Your Ladyship.

01:09:02.491 --> 01:09:05.035
Would you mind coming out this side,
madam?

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:07.622
Yes, I think I’d better.

01:09:07.747 --> 01:09:09.332
Thank you.

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:11.502
Whatever is going on here?

01:09:33.196 --> 01:09:35.948
Good morning.
ls my nephew at home?

01:09:36.073 --> 01:09:38.451
- Nephew?
- Mr Windrush.

01:09:38.577 --> 01:09:40.203
Who? Stan?

01:09:40.328 --> 01:09:42.665
Yes, er... Stanley.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:46.127
Mum, it's Stan's auntie.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.171
Auntie?

01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:50.215
- Will you come in, then, please?
- Thank you.

01:10:09.282 --> 01:10:12.201
I’ve told Stanley you're here.

01:10:12.327 --> 01:10:14.412
- He's just dressing.
- Thank you.

01:10:14.539 --> 01:10:17.833
Cynthia, you go and get dressed, too,
for goodness' sake.

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:20.628
Ooh.. All right, Mum.

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:23.966
- See you later.
- Yes, er... yes.

01:10:24.091 --> 01:10:25.676
I’m ever so sorry.

01:10:25.802 --> 01:10:29.264
It's all my fault. I told Stan
he could have a lie-in this morning.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.517
- Seeing he wasn't working.
- I see.

01:10:32.643 --> 01:10:35.605
Do please sit down, won't you?
I’ll make you a cup of tea.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.648
No, I won't have any tea, thank you.

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:41.612
It's not a bit of trouble.
The kettle's on for Stanley anyway.

01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:45.075
You're very kind, but no, thank you.

01:10:50.957 --> 01:10:55.213
I must say, we do love
having your nephew here.

01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:56.839
Yes, he's a nice boy.

01:10:56.965 --> 01:11:00.594
Yes.
He's so considerate and so polite.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.554
I’m very glad to hear that.

01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:05.809
Nowadays, manners
do seem to have changed, don't they?

01:11:05.935 --> 01:11:07.811
You're telling me.
It's not only manners changed.

01:11:07.938 --> 01:11:09.772
Sometimes I think
the whole world's changed.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.275
- lt has indeed.
- That's what I say.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.985
I was saying to Mrs Kite the other day,

01:11:14.112 --> 01:11:16.823
I say, it's all very well your saying,
'Change this, change that'...

01:11:16.949 --> 01:11:19.659
Wotcha gonna be left with?

01:11:19.786 --> 01:11:23.539
- Perhaps I will sit down.
- Yes, of course. That's the ticket.

01:11:23.665 --> 01:11:24.790
That's right.

01:11:24.917 --> 01:11:27.043
- You make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:29.380
And I’m going to make you
a nice cup of tea.

01:11:29.505 --> 01:11:31.715
Thank you very much.

01:11:31.842 --> 01:11:35.512
Young Stanley's side of the family haven't
got two ha'pennies to rub together.

01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:38.390
Still, I suppose
she looks after them all right?

01:11:38.517 --> 01:11:41.644
She looks after her money.
That's about all she looks after.

01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:47.402
Mind you, I dare say young Stanley will
come in for a bit when she goes upstairs.

01:11:47.527 --> 01:11:50.865
I know Stanley
now calls himself a worker,

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.909
but I’m most anxious
that he shouldn't be disloyal.

01:11:54.035 --> 01:11:56.705
Definitely.
How do you like your tea?

01:11:56.831 --> 01:11:59.500
Strong. And no sugar, please.

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:03.463
After all, family ties count for something.

01:12:03.589 --> 01:12:06.758
No one's entitled to forget
the principles of his upbringing.

01:12:06.885 --> 01:12:08.595
Quite.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.560
You see... it's quite unthinkable
that a gentleman should go on strike.

01:12:14.686 --> 01:12:17.229
I mean, officers don't mutiny, do they?

01:12:17.355 --> 01:12:20.233
No, they don't.
I see what you mean.

01:12:20.359 --> 01:12:23.863
Thank you.
Well, that's what I’ve come to tell Stanley.

01:12:23.989 --> 01:12:25.615
No, go on!

01:12:35.587 --> 01:12:37.463
Don't know what that lot
suddenly turned up for.

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:39.507
They won't see nothing.
This strike's solid.

01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.676
Why don't you tell them
to... ph-ph-...

01:12:41.802 --> 01:12:43.637
photograph something worthwhile?

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:51.563
Hello, what's he come here for?

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.575
You shouldn't be up here, Stanley,
you're in Coventry.

01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:03.411
Anyway, you don't want
this lot picking on you again, do you?

01:13:03.537 --> 01:13:04.956
Well, of course I don't.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:07.291
But the fact is, Mr Kite,

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:09.293
I’ve decided to go back to work.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:11.964
You've what?

01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:14.842
Well, it may be difficult for you
to understand this, but...

01:13:14.969 --> 01:13:16.886
well, it's a simple matter
of loyalty, really.

01:13:17.012 --> 01:13:19.138
I should think
it is a simple matter of loyalty!

01:13:19.266 --> 01:13:21.642
You see, I can't let my family down.

01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:23.560
I mean, Uncle expects it of me.

01:13:23.688 --> 01:13:25.689
Uncle? What's your uncle
got to do with it?

01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:28.818
Well, actually he's Mr Tracepurcel.

01:13:28.944 --> 01:13:30.404
Though he did ask me
not to tell you.

01:13:32.573 --> 01:13:35.368
I should bloody well think he did.

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:36.995
Well, of course I might have known.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.581
Huh! Blind! I’ve been blind.
I might have known.

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:42.710
An agent provocator,
that's what you are.

01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:45.546
- No, no, Mr Kite.
- You whited sepulcher, you!

01:13:45.673 --> 01:13:47.882
Talked your way into the union,
wormed your way into my house,

01:13:48.009 --> 01:13:51.345
and all the time you was a...
you was a fifth column in our midst.

01:13:51.471 --> 01:13:54.474
I didn't mean to upset you
like this, Mr Kite.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.892
Do you mind
if I drive on into the factory?

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:58.353
- No, you don't!
- Come on.

01:14:03.778 --> 01:14:05.571
Fascists!

01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:08.950
All right, go on in, if you're going.

01:14:12.831 --> 01:14:15.499
You filthy traitor, Windrush.

01:14:15.626 --> 01:14:17.711
Judas!

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.551
...and everything else.

01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:25.679
Blackleg.

01:14:25.805 --> 01:14:28.515
Nice thing...

01:14:28.975 --> 01:14:30.643
And me chief shop steward.

01:14:32.105 --> 01:14:34.815
Made me a laughing stock.

01:14:34.941 --> 01:14:36.734
It's not right.

01:14:36.861 --> 01:14:39.321
I’m easy enough, but...

01:14:39.447 --> 01:14:41.949
but there are limits.

01:14:42.075 --> 01:14:44.410
Ooh... home at last!

01:14:44.536 --> 01:14:46.497
My feet are killing me.

01:14:46.623 --> 01:14:49.041
Don't know
why they can't run more buses.

01:14:49.168 --> 01:14:51.544
What a journey.

01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:53.338
Edie sends her love to you.

01:14:53.464 --> 01:14:56.008
- Yes, dear, that's right.
- Put them down there for the moment.

01:14:56.134 --> 01:14:58.469
Have you got that present
for Stanley there, Mum?

01:14:58.596 --> 01:15:00.680
Here it is, dear.

01:15:04.228 --> 01:15:06.062
Stan not had his supper yet?

01:15:06.188 --> 01:15:08.148
- No.
- Why? Isn't he in?

01:15:08.273 --> 01:15:10.484
No. I put the kettle on for you, Mother.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:13.738
- Mum, shall I put it on his plate?
- Yes, dear, all right.

01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:21.622
When will Stanley be back?

01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:25.962
- He is back.
- What do you mean, "He is back"?

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.298
He's back where he belongs.

01:15:29.426 --> 01:15:33.138
'Ere, just a moment.

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:35.598
What exactly do you mean by that?

01:15:37.268 --> 01:15:40.813
- He's packed up and gone.
- Gone where?

01:15:40.939 --> 01:15:43.859
I had no choice, Mother.
You see, he's a blackleg.

01:15:43.985 --> 01:15:48.781
You threw him out?

01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:55.747
Don't cry like that, darling.

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:59.336
Don't upset yourself, Cynthia.

01:15:59.462 --> 01:16:01.964
You see what you've done, don't you?

01:16:05.887 --> 01:16:09.140
What am I going to do
with these suspenders?

01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:12.727
I could tell you.

01:16:12.854 --> 01:16:14.937
It's so unfair.

01:16:15.064 --> 01:16:18.400
He's got no thought for others.

01:16:18.527 --> 01:16:21.696
Now he's ruined my whole life.

01:16:24.785 --> 01:16:27.454
I hope you're satisfied, Fred Kite.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.416
Look, Mother.
lt was democratically arrived at.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:32.084
I mean, I am chairman
of the works committee...

01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:35.172
Yes, you're chairman
of the works committee, all right.

01:16:35.298 --> 01:16:36.590
Don't we all know it.

01:16:36.716 --> 01:16:38.967
Sick to death of you
and your works committee.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:43.057
Union this, union that,
and your blasted Soviet Union.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:46.393
- There is a strike on, Mother.
- You're telling me there's a strike on.

01:16:46.521 --> 01:16:47.770
I’ll tell you something else.

01:16:47.897 --> 01:16:51.692
The strike's spread.
To this house, from now on.

01:16:54.279 --> 01:16:56.989
Cynthia, get our bags packed.

01:16:57.116 --> 01:16:59.743
We're going back to Auntie Edie's.

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:01.662
Two can play at this game, you know.

01:17:01.789 --> 01:17:03.623
You wanted a strike,
you've got one.

01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:06.543
Perhaps when you feel like
going back to work, I will.

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.837
And here's something else
I’m going to tell you.

01:17:08.965 --> 01:17:12.759
Here's another strike
that's 100% solid.

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:22.720
'This is the BBC Home Service.

01:18:22.847 --> 01:18:26.224
'Here is the 9am news for today,
Thursday, March 10th.'

01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:28.978
The Transberberite Embassy
has announced

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:30.563
that its government has cancelled

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:34.276
its one and three quarter million pound
contract with Missiles Ltd.

01:18:34.402 --> 01:18:37.946
in view of the strike there,
now in its fifth day.

01:18:38.074 --> 01:18:40.659
Their spokesman
Mr Mohammed revealed

01:18:40.785 --> 01:18:44.038
that the contract had been re-allocated
to another British firm,

01:18:44.164 --> 01:18:47.918
'Union Jack Foundries Ltd. of Clapton.

01:18:48.044 --> 01:18:51.089
'The Managing Director of Union Jack,
Mr Sidney De Vere Cox,

01:18:51.215 --> 01:18:52.757
'said last night,

01:18:52.883 --> 01:18:55.886
"'Missiles have my sympathy
in their present troubles,

01:18:56.012 --> 01:18:57.596
"'but I naturally rejoice

01:18:57.722 --> 01:19:01.976
"'that this valuable export order
will not been lost to the Old Country."'

01:19:09.404 --> 01:19:10.977
How far is it, Mr Cox?

01:19:11.103 --> 01:19:13.256
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

01:19:14.252 --> 01:19:16.075
What a damn fine morning, Mr Cox.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.808
Couldn't be better, old man.
It's in the bag.

01:19:18.934 --> 01:19:20.383
To quote your English proverb,

01:19:20.515 --> 01:19:29.537
we seem to have the bird by the bush
in the hand.

01:20:01.285 --> 01:20:02.869
Well, here we are.

01:20:19.342 --> 01:20:22.428
- 'Ere! Where do you think you're going?
- On strike, guv!

01:20:22.553 --> 01:20:24.429
On strike?
What are you on strike for?

01:20:24.555 --> 01:20:26.096
ln sympathy with Missiles.

01:20:26.223 --> 01:20:29.225
Sympathy? What about
a bit of sympathy for me?

01:20:29.351 --> 01:20:31.769
- Excuse me, Mr Cox...
- Shut up!

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.330
'Industrial crisis
provides a challenge to a free society.

01:20:54.456 --> 01:20:57.249
'But at such a time
the nation remains calm.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:21:00.877
'Calm because it knows
it can be certain of leadership.

01:21:01.003 --> 01:21:05.005
'Leadership that is bold, tolerant,
yet decisive.'

01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:07.925
I see great principles at stake here.

01:21:08.051 --> 01:21:10.803
As Minister of Labour,
you can be sure that I shall act.

01:21:10.928 --> 01:21:13.429
You can also be sure
that I shall not interfere,

01:21:13.555 --> 01:21:17.724
that is with those great principles
which I deem to be at stake.

01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:21.144
The Trade Union Congress
has deliberated,

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:23.772
and on behalf of my colleagues

01:21:23.898 --> 01:21:30.319
I can say that we are not prepared
either to endorse the strike officially

01:21:30.445 --> 01:21:32.404
nor to condemn it.

01:21:32.531 --> 01:21:37.325
All unions being autonomous
are free to make their own decisions.

01:21:37.451 --> 01:21:42.080
For the time being, the General Council
calls upon employers

01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:46.125
to exercise restraint
and to avoid provocation.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.210
'But behind
the official pronouncements,

01:21:48.335 --> 01:21:50.920
'other vital forces are at work.

01:21:51.046 --> 01:21:53.631
'The traditional respect of the British
for the individual,

01:21:53.757 --> 01:21:59.010
'allied to a rare genius for compromise
and the unorthodox approach.'

01:21:59.137 --> 01:22:00.761
Why don't we just buy him off?

01:22:00.888 --> 01:22:03.264
No, De Vere. It's too risky.

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:05.057
What's he like,
this fellow Kite?

01:22:05.183 --> 01:22:08.102
Absolute shocker.
Sort of chap that sleeps in his vest.

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:11.312
Looks very much
as if we shall have to climb down.

01:22:12.148 --> 01:22:15.316
Do you think the time's ripe, sir?
They're hardly feeling the pinch yet.

01:22:15.442 --> 01:22:18.110
Well, I bloody am.
My men are out too, you know.

01:22:18.236 --> 01:22:19.778
Next thing I’ll lose the contract.

01:22:19.904 --> 01:22:21.613
That's true, Hitchcock.

01:22:21.739 --> 01:22:23.614
The nation's interests must come first.

01:22:23.742 --> 01:22:26.243
Look, all you've got to do
is to go back to the old schedules

01:22:26.368 --> 01:22:28.619
and sack this berk Windrush.

01:22:28.745 --> 01:22:30.747
No, no, Cox. We can't sack him.

01:22:30.872 --> 01:22:33.415
Not just like that, I mean.
Not while he has the press behind him.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:34.958
All right, then.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:39.295
But will somebody please go and find out
just what this geezer Kite will settle for.

01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:42.965
Hitchcock, you'll have to go
and see Kite.

01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.953
- Huh! Oh...

01:24:06.079 --> 01:24:07.579
Hello, Kite.

01:24:07.705 --> 01:24:10.164
I thought for a moment
you might be out on a spree.

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:11.833
And what might you want?

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:15.044
I hope I haven't called
at an inconvenient time.

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:16.546
You might have.

01:24:16.672 --> 01:24:19.340
Mr Kite, I wonder
if I could have a word with you.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.592
I daresay you could. Yes.

01:24:28.598 --> 01:24:31.224
What a charming little place
you have here.

01:24:32.309 --> 01:24:34.477
How's the lady wife and daughter?

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:37.397
- They're away on a bit of a holiday.
- Really?

01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:41.317
I suppose they're finding it difficult
to get back, with the strike on.

01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:43.443
I daresay they are.

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:47.738
Mr Kite, I really came round to see
if I could help you settle this strike.

01:24:47.866 --> 01:24:49.241
- Help?
- Of course!

01:24:49.366 --> 01:24:52.118
My dear fellow, you know me.
I’m on your side in this.

01:24:52.243 --> 01:24:54.953
If they'd listened to me in the first place,
there wouldn't have been a strike.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.248
- Yes, well, I never wanted it.
- Exactly.

01:24:58.374 --> 01:25:01.292
The directors behaved
like absolute shockers...

01:25:01.419 --> 01:25:03.127
looking pretty damn silly now, eh?

01:25:03.254 --> 01:25:05.379
Typical! Typical!

01:25:05.505 --> 01:25:10.466
The point is, from now on
they're more likely to listen to what I say.

01:25:12.928 --> 01:25:15.554
I see.

01:25:15.681 --> 01:25:18.224
Er... perhaps you'd care
to sit down, Major.

01:25:18.349 --> 01:25:19.933
Thank you.

01:25:21.311 --> 01:25:23.019
Do you imbibe?

01:25:23.146 --> 01:25:26.314
- What a perfectly splendid idea.
- Good.

01:25:30.067 --> 01:25:32.110
Well, to kick off,

01:25:32.237 --> 01:25:35.071
supposing I could get them
to consider dropping these new timings?

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:37.531
No, no. Sorry, Major,
it wouldn't work.

01:25:38.408 --> 01:25:41.410
They would have to admit
that these timings was unworkable.

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:45.705
Mind you, to be helpful,
I would agree to the job being retimed.

01:25:45.832 --> 01:25:48.917
Only properly under the supervision
of the works committee.

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.667
I see.
That's very reasonable.

01:25:50.794 --> 01:25:52.587
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:25:53.796 --> 01:25:56.632
You appreciate of course
that Windrush would have to go.

01:25:56.758 --> 01:25:57.925
Of course he will.

01:25:58.051 --> 01:25:59.801
Now, you agree
to get the men back to work,

01:25:59.927 --> 01:26:03.137
and I guarantee to sack Windrush
the moment all this blows over.

01:26:03.263 --> 01:26:04.722
No, no, no, Major, it wouldn't work.

01:26:04.848 --> 01:26:08.308
None of my members would come back
with him still working there.

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:09.809
That is a snag, isn't it?

01:26:16.609 --> 01:26:19.109
- Perhaps you'd like a refill, Major?
- Huh?

01:26:19.235 --> 01:26:21.820
If you're twisting my arm...

01:26:21.946 --> 01:26:23.237
Thank you.

01:26:23.364 --> 01:26:25.615
Windrush is the real problem.

01:26:25.741 --> 01:26:30.035
How do we get rid of the shower
and avoid a public stink?

01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:34.665
You know, I shall never be able
to answer all these, Aunt Dolly.

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.041
Of course not, dear.

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:39.460
You'll have to put an acknowledgment
in the personal column of the "Times"

01:26:39.586 --> 01:26:42.253
Good Lord, Spencer,
what have you got there this time?

01:26:42.381 --> 01:26:44.714
Another present for you,
Master Stanley, just arrived.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.175
Don't bring any more of them in here,
Spencer.

01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:48.927
- There really isn't room.
- Very well.

01:26:49.052 --> 01:26:52.179
And tell Truscott to take all the flowers
to the hospital in the morning.

01:26:52.305 --> 01:26:54.181
Very well, ma'am.

01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:03.730
"With gratitude for your fight
against the rising cost of living,

01:27:03.857 --> 01:27:07.985
"this gift comes to you
from five Cheltenham ladies

01:27:08.111 --> 01:27:09.860
"living on fixed incomes."

01:27:09.988 --> 01:27:11.862
How very kind, Stanley.

01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:14.198
Jolly kind indeed, Aunt.

01:27:14.325 --> 01:27:16.701
Just listen to all that cheer!

01:27:17.994 --> 01:27:19.786
How long have they been there,
Aunt Dolly?

01:27:19.912 --> 01:27:21.204
Hours, dear.

01:27:21.331 --> 01:27:24.457
What a nation we British are
once we're stirred.

01:27:27.836 --> 01:27:32.172
♪ ...who are born of thee

01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:36.259
♪ Wider still and wider... ♪

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:38.886
And the children of Babylon
are destroyed

01:27:39.013 --> 01:27:42.889
and become an abomination
in the eyes of lasciviousness.

01:27:43.016 --> 01:27:46.184
Three cheers for Mr Churchill
and Stanley Windrush.

01:27:46.309 --> 01:27:47.978
Hip hip hurray!

01:27:48.103 --> 01:27:54.024
We want Stanley!

01:27:55.651 --> 01:27:57.485
What can you do with women?

01:28:00.865 --> 01:28:02.656
Thank you.

01:28:02.782 --> 01:28:06.577
Say, you do appreciate my position,
don't you?

01:28:06.703 --> 01:28:08.911
I mean, you do appreciate it?

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:10.664
Yes, I appreciate to a degree,

01:28:10.789 --> 01:28:12.665
but why have the stinker here
in the first place?

01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:14.292
Well...

01:28:14.418 --> 01:28:16.335
There you are.
Not exactly invisible mending,

01:28:16.461 --> 01:28:18.670
but it will keep the draught out.

01:28:19.714 --> 01:28:24.051
Takes you time to find out
who your friends are, don't it?

01:28:25.719 --> 01:28:28.262
Of course I’ve been betrayed.

01:28:28.388 --> 01:28:30.680
We've all been betrayed, old chap.

01:28:31.766 --> 01:28:33.516
Do you think she'll come back?

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:36.102
Mine didn't. Thank God!

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.022
I don't know! I don't know!

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:43.275
I mean, I've always given her
the best I could provide.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.818
She's always fit and well.

01:28:47.237 --> 01:28:49.697
I mean, it ain't
as if she was overworked.

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:53.659
You see, I...

01:28:54.787 --> 01:28:56.745
'Ere! That's it!

01:28:56.871 --> 01:28:59.539
That's it. Overworked.

01:28:59.664 --> 01:29:01.457
- Yeah?
- Yes.

01:29:01.584 --> 01:29:05.211
Ill health brought on by overwork.

01:29:06.505 --> 01:29:08.671
I thought you said
she was in tip-top condition.

01:29:08.798 --> 01:29:10.590
No, not her, Windrush.

01:29:10.716 --> 01:29:13.093
That is how we get rid of him.

01:29:13.218 --> 01:29:19.431
He resigns on account of ill health
brought on by overwork.

01:29:21.684 --> 01:29:23.392
Kite, that's absolutely bang on.

01:29:24.603 --> 01:29:27.105
Ill health brought on
by trying to work the new schedules.

01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:28.481
Yes!

01:29:28.606 --> 01:29:31.608
The best of British luck.

01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:34.152
Do you think
he can he be made to do it?

01:29:34.278 --> 01:29:36.487
You trust his Uncle Bertie.
He'll do as he's told.

01:29:36.988 --> 01:29:39.198
But I’m perfectly fit, Uncle.

01:29:39.324 --> 01:29:41.325
Yes, yes, I know you're perfectly fit.

01:29:41.451 --> 01:29:45.245
This is just a formula, used every day.
Army politics... whatever you like.

01:29:45.371 --> 01:29:47.497
I do wish you'd stop worrying
about me, Uncle.

01:29:47.623 --> 01:29:50.208
Resignation would be
far too easy a way out.

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:51.835
What you've done
has been wonderful,

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.503
and there's no question
of my letting you down now.

01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:57.256
That's very nice of you, Stanley.
I appreciate it, but...

01:29:57.381 --> 01:30:00.299
No, no, Uncle.
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:30:00.926 --> 01:30:02.802
You've already sacrificed that contract.

01:30:02.928 --> 01:30:05.596
I’m not gonna have you
sacrifice your principles as well.

01:30:05.721 --> 01:30:08.682
Don't be such a damned fool, Stanley.
To hell with my principles!

01:30:08.808 --> 01:30:11.226
The two heroes of the hour.

01:30:11.351 --> 01:30:14.520
They're still calling for you, Stanley.
You simply must show yourself.

01:30:14.646 --> 01:30:17.106
- Really, Aunt Dolly, must I?
- Indeed, you must!

01:30:17.231 --> 01:30:19.650
And you too, Bertie.
Come along.

01:30:29.075 --> 01:30:30.826
Quiet, fellers, quiet!

01:30:31.536 --> 01:30:34.245
Tonight at eight-thirty,
we are presenting once again

01:30:34.372 --> 01:30:37.124
our popular discussion programme
"Argument".

01:30:37.249 --> 01:30:40.877
and the subject this evening
is the present industrial strike.

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.961
The producers have arranged

01:30:43.087 --> 01:30:46.047
for some of the leading personalities
connected with the strike

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.798
to appear in the programme.

01:30:47.925 --> 01:30:51.302
So you will hear a spokesman
for the management,

01:30:51.428 --> 01:30:53.554
for the shop stewards,

01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:58.141
and of course Mr Stanley Windrush
who was the cause of the strike.

01:30:58.267 --> 01:31:00.225
The chairman
will be Malcolm Muggeridge,

01:31:00.352 --> 01:31:02.854
so don't forget to look in at eight-thirty.

01:31:09.526 --> 01:31:12.528
If you'd like to put your things in here,
then come down to the make-up room.

01:31:12.655 --> 01:31:15.072
It's just down the corridor.
The others are already there.

01:31:15.198 --> 01:31:16.866
Thank you very much.

01:31:45.515 --> 01:31:47.350
That's right, Stan.

01:31:48.394 --> 01:31:51.312
- It's yours.
- Coxie...

01:31:52.356 --> 01:31:53.897
What on earth are you doing here?

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:56.399
That's your cut.
A little idea of mine.

01:31:58.401 --> 01:31:59.903
My cut?

01:32:00.028 --> 01:32:03.405
Well, you didn't think we was
going to leave you out, did you?

01:32:03.531 --> 01:32:06.450
Only of course, you've got to do
what your uncle says.

01:32:07.743 --> 01:32:09.619
What on earth are you talking about?

01:32:09.745 --> 01:32:12.163
Resign, on grounds of ill health.

01:32:12.289 --> 01:32:15.457
Now, I’ve already had all this out
with Uncle.

01:32:16.834 --> 01:32:19.086
Now, look at me, old Stan.

01:32:20.587 --> 01:32:22.922
This is a bit delicate.

01:32:23.049 --> 01:32:25.675
I daresay your Uncle Bertie
wouldn't like me telling you all this,

01:32:25.801 --> 01:32:30.178
but if you don't resign,
the strike goes on.

01:32:30.304 --> 01:32:33.306
And we all lose
a hundred thousand smackers!

01:32:33.432 --> 01:32:34.474
Who's "we"?

01:32:35.476 --> 01:32:41.021
Well, there's me, your Uncle Bertie
and that black fellow Mohammed.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.692
This is absolute nonsense.

01:32:44.817 --> 01:32:46.943
Uncle's firm's already lost the contract.

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:49.361
Well, yes, in a way.

01:32:50.864 --> 01:32:53.282
To me... Union Jack Foundries.

01:32:54.075 --> 01:32:56.743
You see what it is.
It's business.

01:32:56.869 --> 01:32:58.452
High finance and that...

01:32:58.579 --> 01:33:01.789
Are you suggesting Uncle Bertram
stirred up all this trouble deliberately?

01:33:01.915 --> 01:33:04.917
That's right.
With your help, don't forget.

01:33:05.043 --> 01:33:07.502
Only, it's got to stop now,
or it's no good.

01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:10.630
I’m going crazy!

01:33:10.756 --> 01:33:12.715
I’d have thought
if you wanted to stop the strike,

01:33:12.841 --> 01:33:14.591
you would have been talking to Mr Kite.

01:33:14.718 --> 01:33:17.970
We have, Stan.
Very amicable, too.

01:33:18.095 --> 01:33:20.763
lt was him who suggested
the ill-health lark.

01:33:23.684 --> 01:33:26.811
- There you are, Mr Kite.
- Thank you, Miss.

01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:31.064
Ask the girl to go and see
what's happened to Mr Windrush.

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:32.858
I know you won't say nothing,

01:33:32.983 --> 01:33:37.194
because if you do, your Uncle Bertie
will go inside for a few years.

01:33:37.321 --> 01:33:39.321
Kill your Aunt Dolly, that would.

01:33:39.448 --> 01:33:42.615
Anyway, I prefer to be honest,
put my cards on the table.

01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:44.993
Quite a change for you.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:49.288
Yes, well, you take my advice, Stan.

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:51.540
When it's your turn on the old telly,

01:33:51.666 --> 01:33:54.626
get up quietly and tell them
you want to resign.

01:33:54.752 --> 01:33:56.253
Right?

01:33:58.464 --> 01:34:00.048
Ta-ta!

01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:10.848
Make-up's waiting for you,
Mr Windrush.

01:34:11.683 --> 01:34:13.477
Mr Windrush!

01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:16.604
They're waiting for you.

01:34:18.481 --> 01:34:20.148
Yes, of course!

01:34:31.785 --> 01:34:33.493
'On the air in five seconds.

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.827
'Quiet, everybody!

01:34:34.953 --> 01:34:38.498
'Four... three... two... one.'

01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:47.671
"Argument". The programme
that puts you in the picture.

01:35:03.186 --> 01:35:04.269
Good evening.

01:35:04.396 --> 01:35:08.272
The subject on everyone's mind today
is unquestionably the strike.

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.151
'Now, some people think
that the national economy

01:35:12.277 --> 01:35:14.779
'is being endangered
by the irresponsible...'

01:35:14.904 --> 01:35:16.238
'Ere! Turn it up, will you?

01:35:17.115 --> 01:35:21.118
Other people take the view
that the living standards of the workers

01:35:21.244 --> 01:35:24.036
have been viciously attacked
by the employers,

01:35:24.162 --> 01:35:26.497
who in any case
are in breach of contract.

01:35:27.082 --> 01:35:30.708
We've got in the studio
four people intimately concerned

01:35:30.836 --> 01:35:33.628
in the development
of this unhappy situation.

01:35:33.754 --> 01:35:37.674
On my right is His Excellency,
Mr Mohammed.

01:35:37.799 --> 01:35:40.676
And next to him, Mr Tracepurcel.

01:35:41.552 --> 01:35:44.179
Then, on my left, Mr Kite.

01:35:44.304 --> 01:35:46.806
And next to him, Mr Windrush.

01:35:46.932 --> 01:35:50.560
Before turning these gentlemen over
to the studio audience for questioning,

01:35:50.686 --> 01:35:53.979
I’m going to ask each of them
to make a brief individual statement.

01:35:54.105 --> 01:35:56.606
And I’m going to begin with Mr Kite.

01:35:56.731 --> 01:36:00.359
Now, Mr Kite, as Chairman
of the works committee at Missiles,

01:36:00.485 --> 01:36:02.236
where do you stand?

01:36:03.487 --> 01:36:05.321
Um... oh, yes.

01:36:05.449 --> 01:36:10.368
Um, the situation
is quite straightforward.

01:36:11.661 --> 01:36:16.415
As trades unionists,
we have always been concerned with...

01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:20.334
for efficiency
and for the individual worker.

01:36:21.211 --> 01:36:23.045
And it is...

01:36:24.547 --> 01:36:26.215
lt is for that reason

01:36:26.341 --> 01:36:29.843
that we oppose the attempt
of the management

01:36:29.969 --> 01:36:32.387
to overwork the man on the job.

01:36:32.513 --> 01:36:34.555
Hear, hear!

01:36:35.391 --> 01:36:40.643
lt is for that reason that we oppose
the introduction of blackleg labour.

01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:42.437
Hear, hear!

01:36:42.564 --> 01:36:45.148
And it is for that same reason...

01:36:52.113 --> 01:36:56.491
lt is for that same reason
that we oppose...

01:36:57.951 --> 01:36:59.494
Erm...

01:37:00.037 --> 01:37:03.122
That reason we oppose...

01:37:03.247 --> 01:37:04.706
Hear, hear!

01:37:04.832 --> 01:37:05.874
Thank you, Mr Kite.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.959
You've made the point, I think.

01:37:08.085 --> 01:37:10.294
Now I’m going to call on Mr Windrush,

01:37:10.421 --> 01:37:12.838
who, as a worker at Missiles,

01:37:12.965 --> 01:37:15.883
might perhaps be described
as the odd man in.

01:37:16.009 --> 01:37:19.552
And now, Mr Windrush,
what have you got to say?

01:37:28.394 --> 01:37:30.562
Mr Windrush.

01:37:36.275 --> 01:37:41.029
I’m going to find it pretty difficult
to say what I want to say in a few words.

01:37:42.281 --> 01:37:45.659
ln fact, I’m only now
just beginning to catch on.

01:37:47.537 --> 01:37:50.663
As my friend Knowles
would have said,

01:37:50.789 --> 01:37:52.998
I must have been dead stupid.

01:37:53.707 --> 01:37:56.627
I’ve swallowed everything
they have given me to swallow.

01:37:56.752 --> 01:37:58.753
Everything!

01:37:58.879 --> 01:38:03.340
All the phoney patriotic claptrap
of the employers.

01:38:03.466 --> 01:38:06.760
All the bilge I’ve heard talked
about workers' rights

01:38:06.885 --> 01:38:09.095
until my head's reeling
with the stink of it all.

01:38:10.305 --> 01:38:14.600
The trouble is, everybody's got so used
to the smell, they no longer notice it.

01:38:14.726 --> 01:38:17.143
Furthermore, they're deaf, too.

01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:19.272
So deaf
they can't even hear the fiddles.

01:38:19.397 --> 01:38:21.648
ln fact, they don't want to.

01:38:21.773 --> 01:38:25.943
Wherever you look, it's a case of
"Blow you, Jack, I’m all right".

01:38:26.069 --> 01:38:27.278
On a point of order, Mr Chairman...

01:38:27.404 --> 01:38:30.072
I might have known
you'd have a point of order.

01:38:30.197 --> 01:38:31.990
Hey, this is going to be a beaut...

01:38:32.116 --> 01:38:34.033
This meeting
has got to follow the rules...

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:36.619
- Shut up, Fred!
- Mum!

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.537
We all know
your proper procedure.

01:38:38.664 --> 01:38:42.040
Hang a chap without giving him a hearing.
ls that what they do in the Soviet Union?

01:38:42.165 --> 01:38:44.959
I protest. My politics is a matter
between my conscience

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.919
- and the ballot box.
- Your politics?

01:38:47.045 --> 01:38:49.088
"To each according to his needs,

01:38:49.214 --> 01:38:51.132
"from each as little
as he can get away with,

01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:54.926
"and no overtime except on Sundays
at double the rate."

01:38:55.052 --> 01:38:57.344
That's a damn fine way
to build a new Jerusalem.

01:38:57.471 --> 01:39:01.141
Mr Chairman, I do think that we all
ought to try and deal with each other fairly.

01:39:01.266 --> 01:39:04.100
Don't you fall for that soft soap,
Mr Muggeridge.

01:39:04.227 --> 01:39:05.977
When a deal's fair for Uncle Bertie,

01:39:06.104 --> 01:39:08.479
you can bet your life
it's a wet and windy one for the rest of us.

01:39:08.607 --> 01:39:10.231
Sit down, Stanley,
you're making a fool of yourself.

01:39:10.357 --> 01:39:12.150
You and your talk of "country"!

01:39:12.275 --> 01:39:13.859
You're waving a great big Union Jack,

01:39:13.986 --> 01:39:15.736
so nobody can see
what you're up to behind it.

01:39:15.862 --> 01:39:17.279
What does the idiot think he's doing?

01:39:17.405 --> 01:39:20.365
- What the devil are you playing at?
- Not your little game, Uncle Bertie.

01:39:20.491 --> 01:39:23.034
'You've cheated everyone,
even Aunt Dolly.'

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.411
- 'You leave my mother out of this!'
- 'Pon my soul!

01:39:25.537 --> 01:39:27.245
'You're a bounder,
Uncle Bertie,

01:39:27.372 --> 01:39:31.082
'a streamlined, chromium-plated,
old-fashioned bounder.'

01:39:31.208 --> 01:39:33.001
- You cad!
- You humbug!

01:39:33.127 --> 01:39:35.045
- You traitor!
- You twister!

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:36.920
- Snake!
- Skunk!

01:39:37.047 --> 01:39:39.381
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please...

01:39:39.507 --> 01:39:43.092
- What we want to get at are the facts.
- The facts?

01:39:43.219 --> 01:39:45.553
I’ve got the facts over here.

01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:50.475
Here they are. Hundreds of them.

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:57.063
These are the only facts
that interest anybody in this dispute.

01:39:57.856 --> 01:40:00.608
This is what they all want.
This is all they want.

01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:03.277
Something for nothing.

01:40:21.877 --> 01:40:23.920
Camera three onto Muriel!

01:40:26.089 --> 01:40:28.423
We're sorry to have to leave "Argument"
at this point,

01:40:28.549 --> 01:40:31.717
but a technical hitch has developed
which is beyond our control.

01:40:31.844 --> 01:40:34.053
'We expect to resume
normal services shortly.'

01:40:34.179 --> 01:40:36.097
Blimey! Ain't it marvelous?

01:40:36.223 --> 01:40:39.266
Just when they was getting
nicely warmed up. Ain't it marvelous?

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.852
Brothers, please! Brothers!

01:40:42.979 --> 01:40:45.105
Use your self-control!

01:40:49.734 --> 01:40:51.568
Give me that! That's mine!

01:41:16.466 --> 01:41:20.844
This is the sort of conduct
society can never... will never tolerate.

01:41:21.804 --> 01:41:24.263
You willfully instigated
these disorderly scenes,

01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:26.390
and in the course of doing so,
you saw fit

01:41:26.516 --> 01:41:29.768
to make a wicked and slanderous attack
upon the integrity of your employer,

01:41:29.893 --> 01:41:33.604
a man surely entitled
to your gratitude and loyalty.

01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:34.731
Not content with this,

01:41:34.857 --> 01:41:38.233
you impugned the motives and actions
of your fellow workers

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.278
in the person
of their representative, Mr Kite.

01:41:41.404 --> 01:41:44.613
He offered you comradeship,
and he gave you shelter.

01:41:44.741 --> 01:41:47.324
His reward has been
your treachery and spite.

01:41:58.585 --> 01:42:01.462
Will that lady kindly compose herself
or leave the court?

01:42:02.839 --> 01:42:04.381
- Shut up, will you?
- Fred!

01:42:04.507 --> 01:42:06.090
- You shut up, too!
- Fred!

01:42:06.217 --> 01:42:08.092
ln the face of these outrages,

01:42:08.218 --> 01:42:11.179
your victims behaved
with remarkable generosity.

01:42:11.305 --> 01:42:13.138
Rather than testify against you,

01:42:13.265 --> 01:42:15.891
Mr Mohammed has invoked
his diplomatic immunity.

01:42:16.017 --> 01:42:19.352
Mr Tracepurcel and Mr Kite
were both emphatic in their plea

01:42:19.479 --> 01:42:22.396
that your behaviour
could only be explained by ill health,

01:42:22.523 --> 01:42:24.190
brought on by overwork.

01:42:24.316 --> 01:42:26.525
ln the circumstances,
I am prepared to accept

01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:30.361
that your conduct
was in part due to a mental instability.

01:42:31.156 --> 01:42:33.823
Provided that you
immediately seek medical aid,

01:42:33.949 --> 01:42:37.201
you'll be bound over to keep the peace
for the period of one year.

01:42:51.048 --> 01:42:52.297
Good shot, Major!

01:42:56.928 --> 01:43:00.054
Glorious world to be alive in.-

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.556
- Peaceful here, isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose it is.

01:43:02.681 --> 01:43:06.476
Rather a contrast to all
the undignified rushing and grabbing

01:43:06.602 --> 01:43:08.812
- that goes on outside, eh, Stanley?
- Yes, Father.

01:43:08.938 --> 01:43:12.106
We've turned our back
on all that kind of vulgarity.

01:43:12.232 --> 01:43:14.483
We're only interested in
the simple things

01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:16.692
that mankind has always been after.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:19.112
Yoo-hoo! Mr Windrush?

01:43:19.989 --> 01:43:22.824
- ls that your son with you?
- Yes, do you want him?

01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:24.450
Goodie!

01:43:24.576 --> 01:43:26.285
Stanley, would you like
to come and play with us?

01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:29.454
We're going to have a tournament.
Knockout, you know...

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.957
Thanks, but I don't think
I’m really quite up to it.

01:43:33.084 --> 01:43:34.751
Nonsense, Stanley,
a young fellow like you?

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:36.752
Go on, be a sport.

01:43:36.878 --> 01:43:39.337
- I bet you're jolly good.
- Come on, Stanley!

01:43:39.464 --> 01:43:41.464
None of us are terribly hot, you know.

01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:45.134
- I wouldn't be any good, honestly.
- Rubbish!

01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:47.178
He's only just being modest.

01:43:47.303 --> 01:43:49.638
Come on, ladies,
come and make him play.

01:43:55.061 --> 01:43:56.143
No!
