00:58.081 --> 01:01.751
Reginald.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.771
Reginald.

01:27.709 --> 01:30.911
Anybody there?!

01:35.349 --> 01:37.985
Anybody there?!

01:55.602 --> 01:57.803
Oh. It's just you, Briggs.

01:57.870 --> 02:01.272
Mr. Chilton? Mr. Chilton!

02:03.409 --> 02:05.410
No. No, please! No!

02:26.531 --> 02:28.465
This was Reginald Chilton.

02:28.533 --> 02:31.235
He was the M.P.P. for Toronto East.

02:31.302 --> 02:33.470
Thank you, Lieutenant Governor.

02:33.538 --> 02:36.440
Poor man. This is a terrible business.

02:36.508 --> 02:38.542
Indeed, Your Honour.

02:40.545 --> 02:43.480
- Dr. Grace.
- He has a fractured skull

02:43.548 --> 02:45.481
and a crushed cervical vertebrae.

02:45.549 --> 02:47.517
Either would have been
sufficient to kill him.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.652
Injuries consistent with a fall.

02:49.719 --> 02:53.822
Oh, my God. Reginald.

02:53.890 --> 02:56.992
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary. You are?

02:57.060 --> 02:58.961
Thaddeus Walsh, Provincial Secretary.

02:59.029 --> 03:03.632
I came as soon as I was called.
Reginald was my oldest friend.

03:03.699 --> 03:06.768
Do you know if Mr. Chilton had
any reason to take his life?

03:06.835 --> 03:08.303
Absolutely not.

03:08.371 --> 03:10.572
By every measure he was a man of success.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.408
Did he have any enemies?

03:13.476 --> 03:16.743
Name me one politician
worth his salt who doesn't.

03:16.811 --> 03:19.446
Would you care to elaborate?

03:19.514 --> 03:22.416
Mr. Chilton was a man who got his way.

03:22.484 --> 03:26.887
I admired him for that; others did not.

03:26.954 --> 03:29.723
I see. Thank you, sir.

03:31.693 --> 03:35.461
Detective, this is Mr.
Briggs, the night watchman.

03:35.529 --> 03:37.330
He called the police.

03:37.398 --> 03:40.233
That wasn't all. I seen what done it.

03:40.301 --> 03:42.702
Foul play's at work here.

03:42.769 --> 03:45.137
And not by the likes of you or me.

03:45.206 --> 03:46.772
What do you mean?

03:46.840 --> 03:48.773
It was the work of a ghost.

03:48.841 --> 03:50.676
The Ghost of Queen's Park.

03:50.743 --> 03:54.213
- There's a ghost?
- And not just one; several.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.282
Apparitions have been
sighted through the halls...

03:57.350 --> 04:00.085
lady ghosts, one and all.

04:00.152 --> 04:04.822
But this one... this one was
different from the others.

04:04.889 --> 04:07.225
- How so?
- This one was glowing.

04:07.292 --> 04:10.094
It was glowing?

04:10.161 --> 04:12.129
Sir, what time did you see the ghost?

04:12.197 --> 04:13.731
Ten pm.

04:18.118 --> 04:22.486
A dead politician! Well,
that'll ruffle a few feathers.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.028
Do you have any leads?

04:24.029 --> 04:27.444
Yes, sir. An eye witness, Mr.
Briggs, the night watchman.

04:27.858 --> 04:31.093
- Well, it'll be a short investigation, then.
- Not exactly, sir.

04:31.162 --> 04:34.297
Mr. Briggs claims the murderer was a ghost.

04:34.365 --> 04:35.865
A ghost?

04:35.932 --> 04:37.026
Doing in a politician?

04:37.027 --> 04:39.042
I always thought Queen's Park was

04:39.043 --> 04:41.102
full of happy dafties,
but this takes the cake.

04:41.171 --> 04:43.938
- Happy dafties?
- Crackpots.

04:44.006 --> 04:45.541
Good day, gentlemen.

04:45.608 --> 04:47.842
I've heard about Chilton.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.878
I thought I owed it to your investigation

04:49.945 --> 04:52.147
- to tell you what I know.
- And you are?

04:52.215 --> 04:53.815
Samuel Jenkins.

04:53.883 --> 04:55.817
Toronto Gazette?

04:55.885 --> 04:57.508
Press.

04:58.130 --> 05:01.656
I was conducting an investigation
into Chilton's dealings.

05:01.723 --> 05:02.871
Have a seat.

05:02.872 --> 05:05.934
You've written about Chilton in
the past, if I'm not mistaken?

05:06.061 --> 05:09.197
Yeah. Shame to lose such
a rich vein of material.

05:09.264 --> 05:12.099
You know the slaughterhouses
off Eastern Avenue, the ones

05:12.167 --> 05:14.701
that dumped their effluent
directly into Ashbridge's Bay?

05:14.768 --> 05:17.704
Yes. They nearly caused
an outbreak of cholera.

05:17.771 --> 05:19.339
He owned those.

05:19.407 --> 05:21.308
After I exposed them,

05:21.375 --> 05:24.644
he supposedly sold the
property and went into politics.

05:24.712 --> 05:27.514
- Supposedly?
- In his position

05:27.582 --> 05:29.582
as the province's lands commissioner,

05:29.649 --> 05:31.550
Chilton was pushing the
government to purchase

05:31.618 --> 05:35.287
that exact piece of property...
for an inflated price.

05:35.355 --> 05:36.940
For the new sewage treatment plant.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.154
Did he still has an interest?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.694
The land is owned by a numbered company.

05:41.761 --> 05:43.729
The address is a post box.

05:43.796 --> 05:47.765
The board of directors is
comprised of two Chilton cronies.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.334
What do you think?

05:49.401 --> 05:50.868
Hm.

05:50.936 --> 05:53.271
Did Chilton know you were
investigating his affairs?

05:53.339 --> 05:55.840
Oh, yes. In fact, he was suing me

05:55.907 --> 05:58.576
to discourage further
scrutiny of his dealings.

05:58.644 --> 06:00.577
I see.

06:00.645 --> 06:02.579
Well, with Chilton's death

06:02.647 --> 06:05.282
you would no longer have to
worry about the libel suit.

06:05.350 --> 06:08.285
It was a paper tiger. He
would never have proceeded.

06:08.353 --> 06:10.554
A court case would have

06:10.622 --> 06:11.748
allowed me to subpoena documents

06:11.749 --> 06:14.352
to prove that he still
held a controlling interest.

06:14.726 --> 06:17.627
Of course, now that he's died

06:17.694 --> 06:20.529
under mysterious circumstances,

06:20.597 --> 06:23.031
that might be something
you want to look into.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.107
- I've seen them all.
- Oh!

06:33.175 --> 06:35.109
Mr. Briggs.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.111
There's a tall thin one

06:37.179 --> 06:39.814
with streaming hair and a long flowing robe

06:39.882 --> 06:42.417
who wanders the third floor hallways.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.586
And a maiden in a chequered dress

06:44.654 --> 06:47.989
who pulls it up over her
head to conceal her face.

06:48.752 --> 06:52.459
But most awful of all is the
hanging woman in the basement.

06:52.527 --> 06:54.728
She dangles from a hook,

06:54.796 --> 06:57.531
oozing gloom and sorrow.

06:57.599 --> 07:01.168
Mr. Briggs, the one you saw last night?

07:01.235 --> 07:03.504
Oh, I saw her only in the distance,

07:03.571 --> 07:07.808
glowing with a terrible bluish-green light.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.944
Mr. Briggs, who else was
working here last night?

07:11.459 --> 07:13.918
Sometimes the typists
in the east wing basement

07:13.919 --> 07:15.844
work late when the house is in session.

07:35.101 --> 07:38.803
Yes, we were working late to
finish some reports for Mr. Chilton.

07:38.871 --> 07:41.505
And did either of you
notice anything unusual?

07:41.573 --> 07:43.507
Unusual in what way?

07:43.575 --> 07:45.977
Well, Mr. Briggs says

07:46.045 --> 07:48.847
- that Queen's Park is haunted.
- It is.

07:48.914 --> 07:52.817
- Hogwash, Marge. You've never seen any ghosts.
- Yes, I have.

07:52.884 --> 07:54.985
Well, I haven't actually seen them,

07:55.053 --> 07:58.355
but I felt the presence of a
vengeful spirit on the fourth floor.

07:58.422 --> 08:01.258
That was most likely His
Right Honourable's secretary.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.727
- Very funny.
- I wouldn't put much truck

08:03.794 --> 08:05.729
into what that Mr. Briggs told you.

08:05.796 --> 08:07.998
He isn't quite the full tin of biscuits.

08:08.066 --> 08:12.634
I've seen one. Last night,
just as we were leaving. I saw

08:12.702 --> 08:14.127
the ghost of a woman at
the end of the hallway.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.623
Was she hanging from a hook?

08:16.940 --> 08:18.426
No, she was glowing.

08:19.191 --> 08:20.322
Sir, I think we may be...

08:20.325 --> 08:24.347
premature in eliminating the supernatural
element from this investigation.

08:24.414 --> 08:28.783
At least two people have said they've
seen a glowing ghost in recent days.

08:28.851 --> 08:31.452
George, there is absolutely
no scientific basis

08:31.520 --> 08:33.654
- for the existence of ghosts.
- Yes, sir, but you yourself have said

08:33.722 --> 08:37.457
the absence of evidence is not
necessarily the evidence of absence.

08:37.525 --> 08:41.261
You yourself believe in
God and heaven for instance.

08:41.328 --> 08:43.898
Neither of which I'm bringing
into this investigation.

08:43.965 --> 08:47.534
Yes, sir, but you believe they
exist along with an everlasting soul.

08:47.602 --> 08:50.737
- Yes, George.
- So, sir, it is my theory

08:50.805 --> 08:53.573
that ghosts are souls
that are stranded here

08:53.641 --> 08:55.943
because they have unfinished business.

08:56.011 --> 08:57.911
- Unfinished business?
- Yes, sir.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.213
They are not able to pass on,

09:00.281 --> 09:02.849
because they have a loved one in trouble,

09:02.917 --> 09:05.786
or they themselves have been
wronged terribly, even murdered.

09:05.853 --> 09:08.254
And the sheer injustice of it

09:08.322 --> 09:10.757
makes it impossible for
them to rest in peace.

09:10.858 --> 09:13.592
So, it's your belief, George,
that Mr. Chilton was killed

09:13.693 --> 09:16.261
by the ghost of someone
he himself murdered?

09:16.329 --> 09:17.897
Or wronged in some way.

09:17.964 --> 09:20.065
Oh. That's a very interesting theory.

09:20.099 --> 09:22.301
- Thank you, sir.
- And given unlimited resources

09:22.368 --> 09:24.937
I would happily permit
you to follow this line

09:25.004 --> 09:27.272
of inquiry. But as it
is, I need you to find out

09:27.340 --> 09:30.007
what Dr. Grace has for us. Thank you.

09:33.979 --> 09:35.318
His occipital bone was crushed

09:35.319 --> 09:37.672
and his neck was broken
at the first vertebrae.

09:38.050 --> 09:40.384
So it was the fall that killed him.

09:40.419 --> 09:43.120
Oh, yes. What's interesting is,

09:43.188 --> 09:44.122
given the position of his body,

09:44.123 --> 09:45.123
it seems he went
backwards over the balcony.

09:46.858 --> 09:52.096
As if someone... or
something, forced him back.

09:52.164 --> 09:54.198
Something?

09:56.168 --> 09:59.903
It's my theory that a vengeful
spirit might be responsible.

09:59.972 --> 10:00.495
A ghost?

10:00.496 --> 10:02.759
Now I know what you're
thinking, but it's practically

10:02.760 --> 10:05.508
common knowledge that
Queen's Park is haunted.

10:05.576 --> 10:06.256
I've heard this.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.092
Yes. And we have a witness
that claims to have seen a ghost

10:09.093 --> 10:12.115
last night when Mr. Chilton fell.

10:12.183 --> 10:14.250
Is Detective Murdoch
entertaining this possibility?

10:14.318 --> 10:17.287
He can be a tad close-minded
about such things.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.489
Still, you shouldn't abandon
this avenue of investigation.

10:20.556 --> 10:22.958
You don't think so?

10:23.026 --> 10:26.996
I've been involved in
some scientific experiments

10:27.063 --> 10:29.698
entailing metaphysical
excursions to the other side.

10:29.765 --> 10:32.401
- Metaphysical excursions?
- Yes.

10:32.469 --> 10:35.403
And we've proven that it's possible
to enter the portals of the afterlife

10:35.471 --> 10:36.567
without going all the way over.

10:36.568 --> 10:39.684
Emily, this fits my
theory exactly-that ghosts

10:39.685 --> 10:43.219
are simply spirits that are not yet
ready to pass through those portals.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.313
Then you should pursue
this line of inquiry.

10:45.381 --> 10:48.749
I don't know if Detective
Murdoch will grant me permission.

10:48.817 --> 10:51.751
Then it may be best to seek forgiveness
later than ask permission now.

10:54.322 --> 10:57.957
That journalist, Jenkins,
was on to something.

10:58.026 --> 11:00.327
The company holding the
Ashbridge's Bay property is

11:00.395 --> 11:02.929
in turn held by another numbered company.

11:02.997 --> 11:05.298
One shell inside another.

11:05.366 --> 11:09.435
Mm. Chilton was both a businessman and
a lawyer before going into politics.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.737
So he would have known how to set it up.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.606
This could underlie everything, Murdoch.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.510
But if Chilton submerged his
name to cover up his activities,

11:17.577 --> 11:20.112
that would explain why he
might want to kill someone,

11:20.180 --> 11:23.314
but it doesn't give us a reason why
someone would want to kill Chilton.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.584
- What about the journalist?
- He claims he was working

11:26.652 --> 11:29.921
to deadline at the time of the murder.

11:29.988 --> 11:33.391
Sirs, I have found some information
I believe is very important.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.180
What have you, George?

11:35.247 --> 11:38.615
It pertains to the theory I
expressed to you earlier, sir.

11:38.683 --> 11:40.617
What theory?

11:40.685 --> 11:43.287
Constable Crabtree believes
Mr. Briggs is correct

11:43.355 --> 11:45.289
in thinking our culprit is a spirit

11:45.357 --> 11:47.024
inhabiting Queen's Park.

11:47.092 --> 11:49.593
- Spirits!
- Hear me out, sirs.

11:49.660 --> 11:52.162
I paid a visit to City Records
to look into the history

11:52.230 --> 11:54.697
of the legislative buildings,
my thinking being that,

11:54.764 --> 11:56.966
if it had been built atop a cemetery,

11:57.034 --> 11:59.444
that would explain souls
of the dead rising up

11:59.445 --> 12:02.209
- in anger about being disturbed.
- Oh, George...

12:02.212 --> 12:05.674
But, sir, what I discovered
is far more interesting.

12:05.742 --> 12:09.245
All right, I'll nibble. Go on.

12:09.313 --> 12:13.515
Thirty years ago on the very land on
which the legislative buildings now sit

12:13.582 --> 12:16.618
was... the University Lunatic Asylum

12:16.685 --> 12:19.454
- for Insane Women.
- So?

12:19.522 --> 12:22.991
So?! That explains why
Queen's Park is haunted!

12:23.059 --> 12:26.327
What soul is more likely to
languish in restless disquiet

12:26.395 --> 12:28.595
than that of a deranged woman?!

12:34.081 --> 12:38.351
George, I thought I expressly told
you to restrict your investigation.

12:38.419 --> 12:41.020
- I had some free time, sir.
- Not anymore you don't.

12:41.087 --> 12:44.957
I want you to go down to City Records
and look into the ownership history

12:45.025 --> 12:48.093
of this Ashbridge's Bay
property. And only this.

12:48.161 --> 12:51.196
Sir, if I could just find the
identity of the inmate responsible...

12:51.263 --> 12:53.498
- Now, Crabtree!
- Yes, sir.

12:53.566 --> 12:55.534
You encourage him.

13:01.674 --> 13:04.042
George.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.144
What a pleasant surprise.
What brings you here?

13:06.212 --> 13:08.946
Actually, Doctor, I'm hoping
that you can help me with

13:09.013 --> 13:11.816
- a murder case we're working on.
- Of course. What do you need?

13:11.883 --> 13:14.819
I'm looking for some information
about the University Lunatic Asylum.

13:14.886 --> 13:18.622
Is there some connection between
the old asylum and a case?

13:18.690 --> 13:20.658
Possibly.

13:20.726 --> 13:22.959
Between you and I, Doctor,
there is some evidence

13:23.026 --> 13:26.062
to suggest that a ghost is involved.

13:26.129 --> 13:29.265
A ghost?

13:29.333 --> 13:34.471
Now, Detective Murdoch has yet to
sanction such a line of inquiry.

13:34.538 --> 13:37.540
- I see. Well, how can I help you?
- I'm hoping to have a look

13:37.608 --> 13:40.709
at the files pertaining to the
women who were once inmates there.

13:40.777 --> 13:42.294
Well, when those women
were transferred here,

13:42.295 --> 13:44.548
their files may have come over with them.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.484
Take this note to Clifford

13:48.551 --> 13:51.854
in Records, and he will help you.

13:51.921 --> 13:54.356
That's brilliant. Thank you, Doctor.

13:54.423 --> 13:55.890
Dr. Garland.

13:55.957 --> 13:57.525
Constable Crabtree.

13:57.593 --> 13:59.093
Sir.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.895
Hello, Julia.

14:00.962 --> 14:04.532
Well, Darcy, it seems to be
a day for unexpected visitors.

14:07.202 --> 14:11.337
- I have a favour to ask.
- A favour?

14:11.406 --> 14:13.440
The charity ball tomorrow.

14:13.508 --> 14:15.776
We're expected to bring our wives.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.878
I'm hoping you'll still
be able to accompany me.

14:17.945 --> 14:19.446
I see.

14:19.514 --> 14:21.915
I am aware of the
awkwardness of the situation.

14:21.982 --> 14:23.884
But we agreed that the
hospital board wouldn't

14:23.951 --> 14:26.919
know of the change in our circumstances.

14:26.986 --> 14:29.054
It would be a great favour, Julia.

14:29.122 --> 14:32.458
Yes, yes, of course I'll
come with you, Darcy.

14:32.526 --> 14:34.760
We can be done with the
pretence soon enough.

14:34.828 --> 14:37.663
Next week I mark one year
as chief administrator.

14:37.731 --> 14:42.134
In that position, I'll be a
lot more secure, not as easy

14:42.201 --> 14:45.069
- to dismiss me.
- They're not going to fire you.

14:45.137 --> 14:48.506
Dr. Lamott thinks you're
marvellous. And I will

14:48.574 --> 14:51.910
take the brunt of the scandal
of divorce, as it should be.

14:51.977 --> 14:54.779
- What time do you need me?
- Pick you up at seven?

14:54.847 --> 14:56.514
Fine.

14:56.582 --> 14:58.215
And, Darcy...

14:58.283 --> 15:00.216
rest assured.

15:00.284 --> 15:02.719
I will be my most gracious self.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.600
- What have you, George?
- Ah! Sir!

15:17.668 --> 15:22.271
I looked into the history of
the Ashbridge's Bay company.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.075
Until 1787 that property
was part of the Toronto

15:26.142 --> 15:28.845
Carrying Purchase from
the Mississauga Indians.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.680
It was subsequently allocated
to the United Empire Loyalists...

15:31.747 --> 15:34.716
Bloody hell, Crabtree, we don't need
to go back to the age of the dinosaurs.

15:36.719 --> 15:40.121
Let's see. In 1860 the land was
owned by one Herbert G. Marshall.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.824
His family had farmed it for generations.

15:42.892 --> 15:45.460
He wanted to turn it into a
bird sanctuary before he died.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.828
A bird sanctuary. This Marshall would

15:47.896 --> 15:50.130
turn in his grave if he could see it now.

15:50.198 --> 15:53.033
How did the property come to
be used for slaughterhouses?

15:53.101 --> 15:55.870
When Herbert Marshall died,
it went to his daughter,

15:55.937 --> 15:59.607
Abigail. When she passed, it went
to her husband, Thaddeus Walsh.

15:59.674 --> 16:02.275
The provincial secretary?

16:02.343 --> 16:04.944
Who'd have guessed it?

16:05.012 --> 16:07.413
Another politician up to his neck in it.

16:07.481 --> 16:10.233
Walsh built the slaughterhouses. He
eventually sold them to Mr. Chilton.

16:10.234 --> 16:13.119
Chilton eventually sold them to
the company that owns them now.

16:13.186 --> 16:16.222
I think we should have
another chat with Mr. Walsh.

16:24.864 --> 16:26.832
Yes, I built the slaughterhouses.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.901
It was the best use of
the land at the time.

16:28.968 --> 16:33.138
- Not a bird sanctuary, then?
- A bird sanctuary within city limits...

16:33.205 --> 16:38.709
it's absurd. Cities are for
people, not birds. At any rate,

16:38.777 --> 16:41.311
I sold the operation to
Reginald when I ran for office.

16:41.379 --> 16:43.548
And you have no further
interest in the property?

16:43.615 --> 16:45.650
- None.
- Yet you helped Mr. Chilton

16:45.717 --> 16:47.718
push through a proposal that would have

16:47.786 --> 16:49.787
the government purchase
the Ashbridge's property

16:49.855 --> 16:52.689
- at an inflated price.
- Thick as thieves, you lot.

16:52.757 --> 16:55.926
If we dig into those numbered companies,

16:55.993 --> 16:58.161
what are the chances that
both your names turn up.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.931
You intend to drag my name through
the dirt in an election year?

17:00.998 --> 17:02.999
You're worried about re-election?

17:03.067 --> 17:05.955
If I were you, I'd be more
concerned about my neck in the noose.

17:06.739 --> 17:07.569
The noose?

17:07.637 --> 17:10.405
Mr. Chilton was being
investigated by a newspaper

17:10.473 --> 17:12.775
reporter. That investigation
could have led to you.

17:12.842 --> 17:16.444
- You're suggesting I killed my friend?
- You couldn't kill Jenkins

17:16.512 --> 17:18.113
without drawing suspicion,

17:18.181 --> 17:20.683
but who'd finger you for
your pal Chilton's murder?

17:20.750 --> 17:22.416
Your accusations... !

17:22.484 --> 17:24.417
Do you know who I am?

17:24.486 --> 17:27.722
- I'll have your badges!
- Mr. Secretary,

17:27.790 --> 17:30.191
not even the Queen gets away with murder.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.359
Good day.

17:40.365 --> 17:41.409
Crabtree.

17:41.410 --> 17:42.842
Go to the business registry office

17:42.843 --> 17:45.067
and see what you can find out
about these numbered companies.

17:45.082 --> 17:46.506
Bring the files back with you,

17:46.574 --> 17:49.810
- and pay very careful attention.
- You'll be looking for any traces

17:49.877 --> 17:52.646
of Chilton's or Walsh's names
hidden in the fine print.

17:52.714 --> 17:54.814
Yes, sir.

18:03.857 --> 18:07.392
George. Have you made any
inroads with the inmate files?

18:07.460 --> 18:10.996
I'm afraid I've been waylaid in my efforts.

18:11.063 --> 18:12.998
- Julia.
- William.

18:13.065 --> 18:15.166
Are you busy?

18:18.671 --> 18:22.240
An evening with the hospital board
is a chore at the best of times,

18:22.307 --> 18:25.944
but I must live up to my
arrangement with Darcy.

18:26.012 --> 18:28.746
It is only one evening, Julia.

18:28.813 --> 18:32.750
I can't let him lose his position.

18:32.817 --> 18:37.587
I intend to do everything I
can to protect his reputation.

18:37.656 --> 18:39.589
That's only fair.

18:39.658 --> 18:43.092
This circumstance is hardly his fault.

18:45.729 --> 18:48.665
I wish we lived in a different time,

18:48.732 --> 18:51.701
when we could be together
and the world wouldn't care.

19:04.113 --> 19:06.048
Is Detective Murdoch in?

19:06.115 --> 19:08.050
No, he's gone off with Dr. Ogden

19:08.117 --> 19:10.285
and left me here on a wild goose chase.

19:10.352 --> 19:12.854
Well, I've made an exciting discovery

19:12.922 --> 19:14.955
that just might lift your spirits,

19:15.023 --> 19:17.825
and perhaps pull Detective Murdoch
around to your way of thinking.

19:17.893 --> 19:22.063
Ah, no. A team of workhorses
could not accomplish that.

19:24.399 --> 19:27.634
I've detected high levels of
adrenaline in the victim's bloodstream.

19:27.703 --> 19:31.037
It's not unusual to find elevated
levels in murder victims, of course,

19:31.105 --> 19:33.239
but these were especially high.

19:33.307 --> 19:35.975
- What does it mean?
- Adrenaline is secreted

19:36.043 --> 19:38.678
when the victim experiences
acute psychological shock.

19:38.746 --> 19:41.781
As if he'd seen a ghost.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.912
George, I think there's more to your theory

19:43.913 --> 19:45.575
than Detective Murdoch gives credit to.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.920
Emily, look at this.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.890
Each one of these asylum files
has a complete patient history.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.259
Now, it's my belief that
by going through these files

19:54.327 --> 19:58.063
I may be able to identify some
of the ghosts that have been seen.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.099
We should see the ghost ourselves.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.167
What, spend the night in Queen's Park?

20:03.235 --> 20:05.402
You're finished your shift soon.

20:07.686 --> 20:09.673
How do we know the ghost will
show up? They're notoriously shy.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.876
Perhaps we'll be lucky.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.379
I have a better idea.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.681
We'll capture one.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.287
We call it the scrutiny camera.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.989
I'll set it to take a
picture every 10 seconds.

20:26.057 --> 20:28.891
Is it actually possible to take
a picture in so dark a place?

20:28.959 --> 20:31.994
If we set the shutter to
stay open for a full second.

20:34.331 --> 20:38.200
George... we never did talk

20:38.269 --> 20:41.404
of what happened the day of the evacuation.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.840
Emily, I apologize for overstepping.

20:45.908 --> 20:47.976
- It was just that I thought...
- George, you didn't overstep.

20:48.043 --> 20:50.979
I thought we were about to die, and...

20:51.046 --> 20:53.315
kissing you like that was
highly presumptuous, I know...

20:53.383 --> 20:55.917
I was very glad you did.

20:55.985 --> 20:58.786
- You were?
- I was.

20:58.853 --> 21:02.222
I hear footsteps.

21:02.291 --> 21:05.092
- It's probably just the night watchman.
- No, he just went that way.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.694
What?

21:23.243 --> 21:25.211
Who are you?

21:25.279 --> 21:28.615
I'm sorry. I'm a little lost.

21:28.683 --> 21:33.218
- I was summoned to see Mr. Walsh.
- At this time of night?

21:33.286 --> 21:36.422
Do you know where his office is?

21:38.425 --> 21:40.526
I believe it's the next floor up.

21:40.593 --> 21:42.561
Ah.

21:42.629 --> 21:45.564
- Thank you.
- Well, we should go,

21:45.632 --> 21:49.200
I suppose. I'll check
the camera in the morning.

22:00.312 --> 22:03.112
Doctor Grace.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.182
- Are you scared?
- No, not at all.

22:06.250 --> 22:09.919
If ghosts are just unmoored souls,
they're to be pitied, not feared.

22:09.987 --> 22:11.722
George!

22:17.628 --> 22:19.162
Oh!

22:19.230 --> 22:22.198
- You again?
- Any sign of the ghost?

22:22.266 --> 22:26.135
I felt a chill near the suite of the
lieutenant governor, but no sightings.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.807
I'll get the lights!

22:34.411 --> 22:36.444
Oh, my goodness.

22:39.849 --> 22:42.384
- Is he dead?
- Uh-huh.

22:54.526 --> 22:56.627
You got here quickly, Doctor.

22:56.695 --> 22:58.629
Who discovered the body?

22:58.697 --> 23:00.564
I did, sir.

23:00.632 --> 23:02.065
You did, George?

23:02.133 --> 23:03.868
What were you doing here?

23:03.935 --> 23:06.936
I was setting up the scrutiny camera, sir.

23:07.004 --> 23:09.338
Why?

23:09.407 --> 23:12.876
I was trying to capture proof
of the spirit activity, sir.

23:15.613 --> 23:18.114
George, I thought I told you
to leave all of that behind.

23:18.181 --> 23:20.916
- It was at my suggestion, Detective.
- Dr. Grace...

23:20.983 --> 23:23.184
I believed Constable Crabtree's theory

23:23.252 --> 23:26.288
worthy of consideration.
I was surprised to hear

23:26.355 --> 23:30.526
that you did not, given
your own experience.

23:32.796 --> 23:35.297
Right. What have you found?

23:35.364 --> 23:37.298
Head trauma may be

23:37.365 --> 23:39.834
the cause of death, but
I will not know for sure

23:39.902 --> 23:42.036
till I thoroughly examine the body.

23:42.103 --> 23:44.038
Have we identified him?

23:44.105 --> 23:46.574
Not yet. He actually approached us

23:46.642 --> 23:49.109
shortly before he fell.
He was asking directions

23:49.177 --> 23:53.047
for Thaddeus Walsh's office.
I found this on his person.

23:56.117 --> 23:58.562
"We need to talk. Come to my
Queen's Park office tonight.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.545
Tell no one. T. Walsh."

24:05.760 --> 24:07.694
I don't know him.

24:07.762 --> 24:11.297
You don't seem too sure about that.

24:11.365 --> 24:13.333
Did you summon him?

24:13.400 --> 24:15.068
No.

24:15.135 --> 24:19.038
That's not my signature.
You can check it if you like.

24:19.106 --> 24:21.274
Someone clearly stole my letterhead.

24:21.342 --> 24:24.844
Then where were you at
the time of the incident?

24:24.911 --> 24:26.711
I was on my way home.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.746
Can anyone confirm that?

24:28.814 --> 24:32.951
You can't seriously think that
I had something to do with this.

24:42.294 --> 24:44.895
He's connected to both
deaths in different ways.

24:44.963 --> 24:46.104
Oh, he's mixed up in this, Murdoch.

24:46.189 --> 24:49.733
And I'll wager if we follow
the money trail, we'll find out.

24:49.801 --> 24:52.169
Crabtree, keep digging into those files.

24:52.237 --> 24:53.136
There's got to be something in there

24:53.137 --> 24:54.900
that clearly links to Chilton and Walsh.

24:55.007 --> 24:57.974
Yes, sir. Sir, I know you
don't want to hear any more

24:58.042 --> 25:00.810
about the ghost, but there's
something you have to see.

25:00.878 --> 25:03.146
- What is it?
- Sir, it's a single frame

25:03.214 --> 25:05.515
from the scrutiny camera
film we took at Queen's Park.

25:05.582 --> 25:08.584
Sir, I think that's the glowing ghost.

25:08.652 --> 25:11.421
- It isn't a ghost, George.
- Then what is it?

25:11.489 --> 25:14.689
Excuse me, Constable. My
husband's gone missing.

25:19.862 --> 25:22.164
Oh, my... God.

25:22.232 --> 25:23.668
Ansel.

25:25.580 --> 25:28.737
Could you please state
your husband's full name?

25:30.705 --> 25:33.841
Dr. Ansel Fraser.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.810
When did you last see
your husband, Mrs. Fraser?

25:36.878 --> 25:38.646
Uh...

25:38.713 --> 25:41.082
yesterday evening.

25:41.150 --> 25:44.385
Do you know what he was
doing at Queen's Park?

25:44.453 --> 25:46.986
I have no idea. He...

25:47.055 --> 25:50.990
he wanted to go for a walk.

25:51.059 --> 25:53.793
He often did that in the evening.

25:53.861 --> 25:57.931
Did he happen to mention a Thaddeus Walsh?

25:57.998 --> 26:01.934
Oh, God.

26:02.001 --> 26:03.502
Mrs. Fraser.

26:03.570 --> 26:05.504
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite all right,

26:05.572 --> 26:07.940
Mrs. Fraser. The constable
will see you home.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.611
This way.

26:16.015 --> 26:18.116
- Sir...
- Not now, George.

26:20.319 --> 26:22.487
Dr. Grace,

26:22.555 --> 26:25.457
have you been able to
establish a cause of death?

26:25.524 --> 26:28.960
It wasn't the head trauma from
the fall that killed Dr. Fraser.

26:29.027 --> 26:32.430
He was likely dead upon impact, having
suffered a myocardial infarction.

26:32.498 --> 26:33.997
A heart attack.

26:34.065 --> 26:35.865
Sir, he died of fright.

26:35.933 --> 26:38.068
- As if he'd seen...
- He'd seen a ghost.

26:38.136 --> 26:40.137
Yes, I know where you're
going with this, George.

26:40.205 --> 26:42.200
Dr. Grace, I'd like to see a full report.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.425
And, both of you,

26:43.438 --> 26:45.695
not another word about ghosts.

26:45.696 --> 26:47.107
Sir, there's something you should know.

26:47.178 --> 26:50.313
- Is it about a ghost?
- No... possibly.

26:50.380 --> 26:55.883
Sir, Dr. Ansel Fraser used to work
for the University Lunatic Asylum.

27:05.794 --> 27:09.297
It's part of an independent
investigation I've been conducting.

27:09.365 --> 27:11.499
I know what you're going to say, sir, but

27:11.566 --> 27:15.002
I'm sure these deaths have
something to do with the old asylum.

27:17.071 --> 27:20.841
See if you can find any link
to Mr. Chilton in those files.

27:20.908 --> 27:22.909
Yes, sir.

27:26.214 --> 27:28.248
Whew...

27:42.729 --> 27:44.429
Sir!

27:44.497 --> 27:47.633
Sir! Look at this! Asylum committal papers.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.068
Here is the signature of Dr. Fraser.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.070
Have a look at the name underneath it.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.309
- Reginald Chilton.
- He was the committing lawyer.

27:55.315 --> 27:58.077
Sir, both victims are
connected to this file.

27:59.992 --> 28:01.588
The inmate was Abigail Marshall.

28:01.615 --> 28:03.055
She's the daughter of the chap

28:00.561 --> 28:05.349
who planned to build the bird sanctuary.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.151
Indeed.

28:07.264 --> 28:10.299
That would make her the
late wife of Thaddeus Walsh.

28:10.367 --> 28:13.269
Sir, I believe we've identified
the Queen's Park Ghost...

28:13.337 --> 28:17.166
it's the insane deceased wife
of Provincial Secretary Walsh!

28:17.932 --> 28:19.341
We need to have a chat with Mr. Walsh.

28:19.408 --> 28:22.244
- About my theory?
- No, George.

28:33.055 --> 28:34.989
No!

28:35.057 --> 28:37.658
It can't be! You're dead!

28:37.726 --> 28:40.061
You're dead!

28:40.129 --> 28:42.663
- Who?
- Abigail, my wife.

28:42.731 --> 28:44.431
Where did she go?

28:44.499 --> 28:46.968
There!

28:50.404 --> 28:52.438
Stop! Police!

28:58.913 --> 29:01.848
Do you believe me now, sir?

29:01.916 --> 29:04.250
That wasn't a ghost, George.

29:04.317 --> 29:07.286
Sir, we both just saw it with our own eyes!

29:07.353 --> 29:10.256
It was clearly an apparition
from the afterlife!

29:10.323 --> 29:13.458
It wasn't a ghost, and
I intend to prove it.

29:15.429 --> 29:17.798
What's all this, then?

29:17.866 --> 29:21.133
It's a mixture of zinc
sulphide and facial cream.

29:21.201 --> 29:23.102
It functions as a phosphor.

29:23.169 --> 29:26.639
- Phosphorous, ah, yes.
- No, sir, not phosphorous.

29:26.707 --> 29:28.774
- Phosphor.
- What's the difference?

29:28.842 --> 29:31.644
Phosphorous is an element

29:31.712 --> 29:33.813
that glows when exposed to oxygen.

29:33.881 --> 29:36.715
Phosphor is any compound that absorbs

29:36.782 --> 29:39.250
and then re-emits light
in the visible range.

29:39.318 --> 29:41.686
Right, that should do it.

29:41.754 --> 29:44.389
George, you'll need to hold
your face up to the sun.

29:44.456 --> 29:47.091
For how long, sir?

29:47.159 --> 29:49.427
Um... two hours should do it.

29:49.495 --> 29:51.562
Two?!

29:51.630 --> 29:54.164
Enjoy, Crabbers.

30:01.339 --> 30:03.941
Murdoch, I give you our test subject.

30:04.009 --> 30:06.544
Very good. George, have a seat.

30:12.315 --> 30:13.750
Good God.

30:13.817 --> 30:15.585
Here you are, George.

30:15.653 --> 30:20.089
- There's your ghost.
- Oh, my. Still, sir,

30:20.157 --> 30:23.325
how did Walsh identify the
ghost as that of his dead wife?

30:23.393 --> 30:26.028
Good question. How, Murdoch?

30:26.095 --> 30:28.063
I don't know.

30:28.130 --> 30:32.968
But at least now we know how the
ghost achieved its ethereal effect.

30:33.036 --> 30:34.970
Sir,

30:35.038 --> 30:37.505
- may I wash this off now?
- Not yet, George.

30:37.574 --> 30:40.207
I want to see how long
the luminescence lasts.

30:40.275 --> 30:42.443
So, what's going on?

30:42.510 --> 30:45.145
Crabtree was right. Whether
there's a ghost or not,

30:45.213 --> 30:48.015
someone's going to a lot of
effort to haunt Thaddeus Walsh.

30:48.083 --> 30:52.019
- Mm.
- It was the ghost of my dead wife.

30:52.087 --> 30:53.387
Are you quite sure?

30:53.455 --> 30:55.655
Why would your dead
wife choose to haunt you?

30:55.723 --> 30:58.892
- I don't know.
- Did you collude with your friend Mr. Chilton

30:58.960 --> 31:02.929
to have your wife committed, and
have Dr. Fraser approve the committal?

31:02.997 --> 31:06.600
- My wife was a deeply troubled woman.
- Who was about to turn a very

31:06.667 --> 31:09.168
valuable piece of property
into a bird sanctuary.

31:09.236 --> 31:11.170
It had nothing to do with that!

31:11.238 --> 31:14.006
She was depressed... hysterically so.

31:14.074 --> 31:16.341
I didn't know what else to do.

31:16.409 --> 31:20.245
- It was for her own good.
- She must have felt differently.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.049
The two victims were the
men who were responsible

31:22.050 --> 31:23.606
for committing her to the asylum.

31:24.117 --> 31:26.284
Do you know what I think, Mr. Walsh?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.999
I think this is all a lie.

31:29.422 --> 31:32.590
I think you concocted this "ghost"
to murder your former colleagues

31:32.658 --> 31:35.026
and to deflect suspicion from yourself.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.897
You're wrong. I'm being haunted

31:39.965 --> 31:42.433
by my former wife. I don't know why,

31:42.501 --> 31:45.068
but I want the police
to stop persecuting me

31:45.136 --> 31:47.203
and start protecting me!

31:47.271 --> 31:50.473
Protect you from a ghost? How
do you propose we do that, then?

31:50.541 --> 31:54.544
If there are no further questions.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.750
Sirs, I wouldn't be so quick to conclude

32:00.817 --> 32:03.352
the glowing woman is not a ghost.

32:03.419 --> 32:05.621
See?

32:05.689 --> 32:07.556
The cream doesn't glow anymore.

32:07.624 --> 32:09.659
He's right.

32:09.726 --> 32:12.427
You brought me inside at 11
o'clock. It's now just past one.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.396
So, what's your point?

32:14.464 --> 32:16.698
My point is, the cream lasts
for less than two hours.

32:16.766 --> 32:19.701
In each case the ghost was seen
three to five hours after sunset.

32:19.769 --> 32:23.171
Well, Murdoch, is there
any other concoction

32:23.238 --> 32:26.174
you can think of that would
hold a glow for five hours?

32:26.241 --> 32:27.742
Not offhand, no.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.778
Sir, could she have

32:29.845 --> 32:32.412
charged herself up under a light bulb?

32:32.480 --> 32:34.882
No, the intensity of a light
bulb would be insufficient.

32:34.949 --> 32:38.285
Well, then... it must be a ghost.

32:38.352 --> 32:42.355
- I hate to say it, Murdoch.
- Sir, you can't possibly think...

32:42.423 --> 32:44.324
It glows, it looks like
Abigail Marshall, and I don't

32:44.392 --> 32:47.260
think this is all the
brainchild of Thaddeus Walsh.

32:47.328 --> 32:49.662
Run with it, Crabtree.
Find out what you can

32:49.730 --> 32:51.564
about Abigail Marshall
and this ghost business.

32:51.631 --> 32:53.166
Yes, sir.

32:55.135 --> 32:57.670
You're just encouraging him.

32:59.807 --> 33:01.340
Emily!

33:01.408 --> 33:03.309
They've finally come around to supporting

33:03.376 --> 33:05.310
my ghost investigation! At least,

33:05.377 --> 33:07.946
- Inspector Brackenreid has.
- That's excellent news, George.

33:08.014 --> 33:09.948
My plan is to return to Queen's Park

33:10.016 --> 33:12.017
with the scrutiny camera
if you'd care to assist me.

33:12.085 --> 33:14.019
Of course.

33:14.087 --> 33:16.654
I can finish this work later.

33:16.723 --> 33:19.824
So, how do you propose we get
a sharper picture this time?

33:19.891 --> 33:22.459
I'm going to widen the aperture

33:22.527 --> 33:25.196
and shorten the exposure.

33:25.263 --> 33:27.564
- Huh.
- Emily, what's that?

33:27.632 --> 33:29.100
What?

33:29.167 --> 33:31.368
Something's glowing over there.

33:31.436 --> 33:33.370
Indeed it is.

33:33.438 --> 33:36.940
It's coming from Dr. Fraser.

33:41.411 --> 33:43.913
There was something in
the creases of his palm

33:43.981 --> 33:48.618
during my post-mortem. I thought it
was dirt, but it's something else.

33:48.685 --> 33:51.621
- What?
- Something that glows.

33:51.688 --> 33:54.123
Do you think it's from the ghost?

33:54.190 --> 33:56.759
Ghosts don't manifest physical matter.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.261
Yes, right, no, I know.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.364
I suppose we should
inform Detective Murdoch.

34:08.404 --> 34:10.405
For all his finesse as a surgeon,

34:10.473 --> 34:13.241
Dr. McKenzie doesn't cut much
of a figure on the dance floor.

34:13.309 --> 34:16.076
He ruined the shoe on my left foot.

34:16.143 --> 34:18.210
I think you've finally made
an impression with Dr. Lamott.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.246
He was hanging on your every word.

34:20.315 --> 34:23.250
Really? Perhaps I should
have brought up the benefits

34:23.318 --> 34:26.353
of a contraception clinic
while I had him in my thrall.

34:30.824 --> 34:33.293
It was a wonderful evening,
Julia. Thank you for coming.

34:33.360 --> 34:37.029
You're welcome, Darcy. I'm glad you asked.

34:37.097 --> 34:40.132
I'd forgotten how much
I enjoy your company.

35:04.356 --> 35:06.390
William.

35:06.458 --> 35:07.892
Julia!

35:07.960 --> 35:10.361
My goodness, you look beautiful.

35:10.429 --> 35:13.397
Well, thank you, Detective.

35:13.465 --> 35:15.947
I just came by to say good night.

35:16.127 --> 35:18.602
How was the ball? Not too tedious, I hope.

35:18.670 --> 35:21.104
I survived.

35:21.172 --> 35:23.673
William, what is causing that luminescence?

35:23.741 --> 35:26.476
Oh, it's something I've never seen before.

35:26.544 --> 35:28.946
It was found on the hands
of our latest victim.

35:29.013 --> 35:32.415
What I suspect... it's impossible.

35:32.483 --> 35:34.517
Have a look.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.222
I suspect it's a compound of some sort

35:39.289 --> 35:42.992
and one of the ingredients
is... radium dust.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.995
- That's remarkable.
- But who here in Toronto would

35:46.063 --> 35:48.364
have access to such a rare element?

35:48.431 --> 35:50.900
Actually, I have read about
a scientist who went to Paris

35:50.968 --> 35:53.634
to consult with Madame Curie
on her work with radium.

35:53.702 --> 35:55.670
Someone in Toronto now?

35:55.738 --> 35:57.705
Do you recall the name?

35:57.773 --> 36:02.210
I do. It's Professor Paul Monteith.

36:02.278 --> 36:07.182
Incredible as it seems, this appears
to contain the very same substance

36:07.250 --> 36:09.516
- as I've been working with.
- Radium.

36:09.584 --> 36:13.153
Yes. I've been developing
a radium paint compound.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.089
To what purpose?

36:15.156 --> 36:17.157
A company in the United States

36:17.225 --> 36:19.960
hopes one day to create pocket
watches with glowing dials.

36:20.028 --> 36:22.429
Hm.

36:22.497 --> 36:23.963
Professor Monteith,

36:24.031 --> 36:26.332
does anyone else have
access to your materials?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.935
No. I work entirely alone.

36:29.003 --> 36:31.751
It's a very painstaking
and meticulous process,

36:31.752 --> 36:32.752
as you might imagine.

36:34.241 --> 36:36.709
- I knew it wasn't a ghost.
- No.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.745
The substance that our so-called
ghost used was a compound

36:39.813 --> 36:42.214
of Jonteel Beauty Cream, water, and radium.

36:42.282 --> 36:45.150
- And what is this radium?
- It's a newly discovered element.

36:45.218 --> 36:48.186
It produces a persistent luminescent glow.

36:48.254 --> 36:51.356
Our ghost must have applied
the beauty cream to her face

36:51.424 --> 36:53.658
then found a way to imbue
her clothing in radium.

36:53.726 --> 36:57.594
- How did she get a hold of it?
- I have no idea.

36:57.662 --> 36:59.696
It's very rare, difficult to produce.

36:59.764 --> 37:03.367
As a matter of fact, we only know of
one scientist who's been working with it.

37:03.435 --> 37:06.003
Sirs, I've discovered something
I believe is of significance.

37:06.071 --> 37:07.671
What is it?

37:07.739 --> 37:10.241
When Abigail Marshall was
committed to the Lunatic Asylum,

37:10.309 --> 37:11.775
she was pregnant.

37:11.776 --> 37:14.054
Oh? And she had the child?

37:14.678 --> 37:17.847
Asylum records state only
that she went into labour.

37:17.915 --> 37:20.750
The next entry lists that
she died two days later.

37:20.818 --> 37:22.419
She died in childbirth.

37:22.486 --> 37:24.754
- Along with the baby?
- Well, the thing is,

37:24.822 --> 37:28.023
I then went to City Records and
they do have a record of the birth...

37:28.091 --> 37:29.558
a girl, Lorraine.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.927
The interesting thing is, the signature

37:31.995 --> 37:34.997
on that birth certificate
is that of Imogene Fraser.

37:35.065 --> 37:37.199
- The wife of our second victim.
- Yes, sir.

37:37.267 --> 37:40.235
When Dr. Fraser was the head
of the Lunatic Asylum, his wife,

37:40.303 --> 37:43.705
Mrs. Fraser, was the matron.

37:52.414 --> 37:55.450
This is all my fault.

37:55.517 --> 37:58.353
Ansel's dead because of me.

37:58.420 --> 38:00.587
How so?

38:00.654 --> 38:03.756
I had no idea she'd do something like this.

38:03.824 --> 38:07.227
I just thought she had a
right to know who she was,

38:07.295 --> 38:10.530
to know who her mother was.

38:10.598 --> 38:13.100
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fraser,
who are we talking about?

38:13.167 --> 38:15.869
Lorraine.

38:15.936 --> 38:18.704
Abigail Marshall's daughter.

38:22.442 --> 38:26.445
It was you. You took the child from her.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.082
I did as I was instructed.

38:30.150 --> 38:33.985
Who gave those orders?

38:34.053 --> 38:36.787
The lawyer, Mr. Chilton.

38:36.855 --> 38:41.393
Abigail was inconsolable.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.295
The baby was the only thing she had.

38:44.363 --> 38:50.167
Two days after we wrested
Lorraine from her arms,

38:50.235 --> 38:52.436
she hanged herself.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.538
But not before

38:54.605 --> 39:00.110
writing a letter to the
child she would never know.

39:00.178 --> 39:03.747
You went to see Lorraine, didn't you?

39:05.715 --> 39:10.653
Yes, to give her the letter

39:10.720 --> 39:15.324
along with a photograph of her mother.

39:15.392 --> 39:17.760
She's the perfect likeness.

39:19.763 --> 39:22.297
Why now, after you'd kept your silence

39:22.365 --> 39:24.700
for all these years?

39:24.768 --> 39:29.271
My conscience could abide no
longer the wrong we'd done.

39:31.274 --> 39:35.277
Neither my husband nor
I were in good health.

39:35.344 --> 39:39.080
I'd hoped to make amends

39:39.147 --> 39:44.251
so we might... meet again in heaven.

39:44.319 --> 39:48.389
What happened to the child, to Lorraine?

39:48.457 --> 39:53.393
They asked me to arrange for an adoption.

39:53.461 --> 39:55.395
She went to a good home.

39:55.463 --> 39:57.864
Who took her in?

39:57.932 --> 40:00.467
So you had no idea of the child's origins?

40:00.534 --> 40:02.102
No.

40:02.169 --> 40:08.075
My wife and I raised Lorraine
as though she were our very own.

40:08.142 --> 40:11.110
Do you know where your
daughter is now, Professor?

40:13.513 --> 40:17.016
- She's at her place of work.
- And where is that?

40:17.084 --> 40:19.018
She works at Queen's Park.

40:19.086 --> 40:22.254
She's a typist there.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.802
Pardon us, ladies.

40:39.839 --> 40:42.673
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

40:44.643 --> 40:47.945
Miss Monteith, we need to have a talk.

40:58.905 --> 41:01.273
Do they read like the
thoughts of a madwoman?

41:03.408 --> 41:07.011
- No, they do not.
- They shut her up in that horrible place.

41:07.079 --> 41:09.714
They stole her life.

41:09.782 --> 41:11.716
And for what?

41:11.784 --> 41:13.852
A miserable piece of land.

41:15.821 --> 41:17.421
So you took your revenge.

41:17.489 --> 41:19.957
I'd heard about the ghosts at Queen's Park.

41:20.024 --> 41:23.494
I knew two of the men
responsible worked there.

41:23.561 --> 41:27.063
And you knew of your adoptive
father's work with radium.

41:27.131 --> 41:29.099
I intended to haunt them

41:29.166 --> 41:32.102
as my mother's ghost,
make them feel the terror

41:32.169 --> 41:34.403
she must have felt every
day in that awful place.

41:34.471 --> 41:36.672
But I never intended for them to die.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.841
You didn't?

41:38.909 --> 41:41.410
It was their own guilt that killed them.

41:41.478 --> 41:44.747
I never touched Chilton.
He fell all by himself.

41:44.815 --> 41:46.916
And Dr. Fraser?

41:46.984 --> 41:50.418
I don't know what happened.

41:50.486 --> 41:54.489
He just grabbed his chest
and fell down the stairs.

41:57.326 --> 41:59.694
The only one I intended to kill was Walsh.

41:59.762 --> 42:01.429
Your father.

42:01.497 --> 42:06.133
He was no father to me.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.301
What's happening to me?

42:10.572 --> 42:12.506
She's not well, is she?

42:12.574 --> 42:15.475
Maybe it's the radium stuff she
was rubbing all over herself.

42:15.544 --> 42:18.746
It's a very new discovery.
We know so little about it.

42:18.813 --> 42:21.982
- Are we going to charge her?
- I'm not sure how.

42:22.050 --> 42:25.118
The person I'd really like
to charge is Thaddeus Walsh.

42:25.186 --> 42:27.120
That's not very likely,

42:27.188 --> 42:30.323
although his political
career is most likely ruined.

42:30.391 --> 42:34.827
Sometimes there's just no
justice in the world. Drink?

42:34.895 --> 42:37.264
I might almost say yes.

42:40.934 --> 42:43.702
George. I thought we might
return to Queen's Park

42:43.770 --> 42:46.338
to attempt the capture of one
of the real ghosts on film.

42:46.406 --> 42:48.340
Unfortunately Detective Murdoch has made it

42:48.408 --> 42:50.876
abundantly clear I'm not
to use the scrutiny camera

42:50.944 --> 42:53.756
for any more extra-departmental activities.

42:53.757 --> 42:55.510
He's even put it under lock and key.

42:55.847 --> 42:58.950
Oh. That is a shame.

42:59.017 --> 43:01.719
However, Emily, there are
said to be several soldiers

43:01.787 --> 43:05.790
from the war of 1812 who haunt
the shores of Grenadier Pond.

43:05.857 --> 43:08.926
I don't know if you'd be up
for an excursion to High Park?

43:08.994 --> 43:11.095
I happen to be free this evening.

43:11.162 --> 43:16.133
Excellent. Now, we won't have the camera
to keep watch for us, unfortunately.

43:16.201 --> 43:19.403
Then we shall simply have
to keep each other awake.
