WEBVTT

00:18.310 --> 00:21.855
- Never get tired of this sight.
- You and me both.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.529
<i>- Where's number three? McMannis.
- Yeah?</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.489
We have a loose one.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.369
l can't take much more of this!

00:36.787 --> 00:38.121
<i>lt's driving us crazy!</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:43.961
Where's Taylor?

00:45.671 --> 00:48.173
- Maybe she got lucky and escaped.
- They're coming.

00:55.472 --> 01:00.352
Oh, my God. Tell me you did not
just wave at me, Vance.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.688
You call yourself a supermodel?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.022
Right now, the only thing
you are super at

01:05.232 --> 01:07.359
is looking like an idiot on TV!

01:08.944 --> 01:10.863
l count two of you.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.365
Where is little princess
number three?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.450
Oh, my God.

02:22.969 --> 02:27.223
The next award to be presented is
the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal.

02:27.432 --> 02:32.353
Would Special Agent Leroy
Jethro Gibbs please step forward.

02:41.112 --> 02:44.324
- She went with the elf cut?
- lt's called the Pixie.

02:44.491 --> 02:47.243
- l think she looks terrific.
- Where's Gibbs?

02:47.410 --> 02:48.912
ln all the years l've known him,

02:49.078 --> 02:50.914
he's never once turned up
for an award ceremony.

02:51.247 --> 02:53.082
Even if he's the one receiving,
Ducky?

02:53.291 --> 02:55.919
Especially if he's the one
receiving it.

02:57.879 --> 02:58.963
Special Agent Gibbs?

02:59.172 --> 03:02.342
Told you he wouldn't show. Pay up.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.261
- Got change for a 20?
- No.

03:08.681 --> 03:11.851
- Nice haircut.
- Where the hell is he, DiNozzo?

03:12.060 --> 03:14.103
- He's working on a case.
- What case?

03:14.479 --> 03:16.564
The one that's preventing him
from being here.

03:16.773 --> 03:19.317
l'll take that for him, though. l...

03:20.401 --> 03:25.406
Accepting for Special Agent Gibbs
is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.579
She's pretty.

03:31.955 --> 03:33.915
l like to think that
l'm the Michael Douglas

03:34.082 --> 03:35.959
to his Karl Malden,
on the streets of D.C.

03:36.126 --> 03:39.671
Thank you, everybody.
That concludes our award ceremony.

03:39.879 --> 03:43.383
- Thank you.
- Gibbs thanks you. Thank you.

03:45.844 --> 03:48.805
ls this on? l have a speech. l didn't--

03:50.431 --> 03:52.308
l wrote a whole...

03:52.725 --> 03:54.477
Whole thing.

03:55.687 --> 03:56.729
Gibbs.

03:57.397 --> 03:59.149
Where are you?

03:59.315 --> 04:00.650
l'm right behind you.

04:02.152 --> 04:04.112
l really hate it when you do that.

04:05.905 --> 04:07.365
Tony has your award.

04:07.949 --> 04:09.576
He can keep it.

04:10.243 --> 04:13.913
Some things never change,
do they, Jethro?

04:15.206 --> 04:17.416
Depends on your definition
of change.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.084
My definition?

04:19.293 --> 04:22.589
l expect you to be there the next time
l'm handing you an award.

04:22.839 --> 04:25.717
DiNozzo didn't tell you?
l'm working a case.

04:25.925 --> 04:28.553
- Alone in my office?
- lt's high-profile, Jen.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.181
l thought you'd wanna hear about it
before it hits the news.

04:31.389 --> 04:34.350
- l'm listening.
- Well...

04:34.601 --> 04:37.020
- There's a dead celebrity at Quantico.
- Who?

04:37.228 --> 04:40.607
- Some woman named Taylor Shane.
- The supermodel?

04:40.815 --> 04:44.027
Found her hanging from an OCS
security fence this morning.

04:44.235 --> 04:47.697
- Then why aren't you there?
- l just got the call five minutes ago.

04:47.906 --> 04:50.575
Oh, and the award ceremony
started 30 minutes ago.

04:50.784 --> 04:53.661
Well, l like to get a head start
on things. l'll keep you informed.

04:53.870 --> 04:56.372
Jethro, the press is gonna be
all over this one.

04:56.539 --> 04:59.375
l'd appreciate it
if you could go easy on them.

04:59.584 --> 05:01.169
Telling me how
to do my job, director?

05:01.336 --> 05:03.880
No, just reiterating
your previous point.

05:04.088 --> 05:07.175
- Which was...?
- l know you.

05:13.515 --> 05:14.599
Break out the gear.

05:16.017 --> 05:17.685
<i>Boot Camp Babes
is a real TV show?</i>

05:17.894 --> 05:21.815
Reality TV at its finest.
Three hot, rich babes

05:22.023 --> 05:25.109
- learning what's truly important in life.
- Defending their country.

05:25.318 --> 05:28.988
No, firing machine guns
while wearing bikinis.

05:29.197 --> 05:30.907
Think l like your reason better, Ziva.

05:31.116 --> 05:34.410
Your Marine Corps would actually
allow these models to serve?

05:34.577 --> 05:36.704
Well, they're not joining for real.

05:36.913 --> 05:39.624
<i>lt's a stunt.
lt's kind of like The Simple Life.</i>

05:39.833 --> 05:42.418
<i>- The Simple Life?
- Yeah, that show about Paris Hilton.</i>

05:42.627 --> 05:45.421
l've never heard of it.
But l've been there a few times.

05:45.588 --> 05:47.549
l wouldn't mind spending
a night there myself.

05:47.757 --> 05:50.635
Oh, you have no idea.
l often dream about it.

05:50.844 --> 05:52.929
Really?

05:54.013 --> 05:55.265
What?

05:55.473 --> 05:57.934
Just trying to picture
Paris and you together.

05:58.143 --> 06:01.938
Don't get your hopes up.
l'm not attracted to blonds.

06:04.232 --> 06:05.275
This is bad.

06:05.483 --> 06:07.652
Gibbs is gonna go
completely and utterly ape--

06:19.747 --> 06:22.625
What is the official word
on Taylor Shane's cause of death?

06:22.834 --> 06:25.753
- Like l said, l just got here.
- What condition was her body in?

06:25.962 --> 06:28.590
- l just got here. l haven't--
- What about the other girls?

06:28.798 --> 06:31.217
How are the other girls handling it?
How are they handling it?

06:35.096 --> 06:38.057
- Okay, that's it. lnterview's over.
- l'm sorry. lt was an accident.

06:38.266 --> 06:40.143
l don't care.

06:42.228 --> 06:46.024
- Sergeant, secure the area.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

06:58.995 --> 07:00.663
Wow, she really was beautiful.

07:01.206 --> 07:03.708
She still is, Mr. Palmer.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.377
She's been dead
at least five hours, Jethro.

07:06.586 --> 07:08.505
l'm more interested
in how she got that way, Duck.

07:08.713 --> 07:12.091
Well, her body is covered
with these lacerations.

07:12.509 --> 07:14.636
None of them appear to be fatal.

07:14.844 --> 07:16.513
We'll know more
when we get her back.

07:20.016 --> 07:21.601
l'll just go get the gurney now.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.937
- Who moved the body?
- l did, sir.

07:24.854 --> 07:27.899
Didn't think it was right, them taking
pictures of Taylor hanging on the wire.

07:28.858 --> 07:32.362
You have any crime-scene experience,
Staff Sergeant McMannis?

07:32.570 --> 07:35.406
No, sir. But l do have
public-affairs experience.

07:35.615 --> 07:38.743
Photos like that aren't why the Corps
agreed to support this show.

07:38.952 --> 07:40.995
- You the liaison?
- Yes, sir.

07:41.162 --> 07:43.540
We've been trying to contact
the producer, Thomas Crawley.

07:43.873 --> 07:46.042
He doesn't know anything
about this yet.

07:48.086 --> 07:50.672
- How'd she get up there?
- Looked like she was trying to climb.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.757
But that doesn't
make any sense, sir.

07:52.966 --> 07:55.343
lf she wanted off the show,
all she had to do was ask.

07:55.552 --> 07:57.679
lt's not like this is a real boot camp.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.225
McGee, photos. Ziva, interview
the rest of the models. DiNozzo--

08:02.392 --> 08:05.145
Boss, l'm pretty familiar with the show.
Maybe l should interview them.

08:05.311 --> 08:08.148
That would work for me.
l hate models.

08:09.649 --> 08:10.775
That so?

08:11.151 --> 08:14.362
McGee, help Ziva. lnterview them.

08:15.363 --> 08:16.948
Any other suggestions, DiNozzo?

08:17.157 --> 08:19.742
- No, l think l got it.
- Good.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.704
l'm gonna need to see all the footage
that you shot on this.

08:22.912 --> 08:26.583
You got it, sir. Postproduction office
is right over here.

08:26.791 --> 08:28.960
Do you want me
to get their autographs, Tony?

08:31.296 --> 08:35.967
Hey, probie. See if you can get them
to sign it to ''the Big D.''

08:41.639 --> 08:44.017
What was she doing out there,
Hannah?

08:44.225 --> 08:45.935
Probably just looking
for a bigger story line.

08:46.436 --> 08:49.022
- What?
- Think about it, Nat. The big escape?

08:49.230 --> 08:51.191
Would've made some great TV.

08:51.399 --> 08:53.776
Unfortunately, it did.

08:54.027 --> 08:56.362
Special Agent McGee,
Officer David, NClS.

08:56.529 --> 08:58.990
We would like to ask you
a few questions.

08:59.199 --> 09:02.911
- ln private, please.
- Okay. Let's go.

09:05.789 --> 09:08.833
When was the last time
you saw Ms. Shane?

09:09.042 --> 09:10.919
- Lights out.
- Time?

09:11.377 --> 09:12.879
Around 1 0:30.

09:13.129 --> 09:15.048
Do you really believe
she did this as a stunt?

09:15.215 --> 09:17.717
l don't know. Taylor would do anything
for more camera time.

09:17.926 --> 09:19.761
Hannah, she's dead, okay?
Stop being a bitch.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.180
The cameras are off, Natalie.

09:22.388 --> 09:24.682
You can stop pretending
you cared about her.

09:26.226 --> 09:27.769
You didn't get along.

09:27.977 --> 09:30.355
We're supermodels, honey.
We don't have to get along.

09:30.772 --> 09:33.066
On the show, you three
seem like such good friends.

09:34.484 --> 09:36.486
They shoot us 24 hours a day,
Agent McGee.

09:36.694 --> 09:39.447
You only get to see 23 minutes of it.

09:42.951 --> 09:44.953
Just about done here.
Thought l'd check on the team.

09:45.161 --> 09:48.123
You're riding with the body. Make sure
those reporters don't follow you back.

09:48.289 --> 09:50.834
- How am l supposed to--?
- lmprovise.

09:52.210 --> 09:55.004
- Give me the keys. l'm driving.
- Tony.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.382
Thanks, Ducky.

10:04.681 --> 10:06.766
Anything else we can help you with?

10:06.975 --> 10:08.685
Maybe some hair tips
for your girlfriend here?

10:10.311 --> 10:13.064
No, l think that about covers it.

10:13.273 --> 10:18.194
But if you can remember anything else
that might help, please give us a call.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.697
lt's called a business card.

10:20.905 --> 10:23.741
Maybe you can have
one of the Marines read it to you.

10:26.953 --> 10:29.539
No bones broken,
no major arteries severed.

10:29.706 --> 10:31.124
And take a look at the tox screen.

10:31.332 --> 10:35.628
No, her death was not the result
of tangling with the razor wire.

10:35.837 --> 10:38.131
- Phencyclidine. Angel dust.
- Yeah.

10:38.339 --> 10:42.552
An overdose of PCP drove
that poor girl flailing into that fence.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.388
She had a seizure,
fell into a coma and died.

10:45.597 --> 10:47.182
- Accidental overdose, Duck?
- l doubt it.

10:47.348 --> 10:52.061
She had enough PCP in her system
to kill a small water buffalo.

10:52.729 --> 10:56.608
- Water buffalo?
- l tire of saying ''small horse.''

10:56.816 --> 11:00.528
l'm afraid our young model
might have committed suicide.

11:00.737 --> 11:04.157
- We don't investigate suicides, Duck.
- No.

11:04.324 --> 11:07.118
- We don't investigate suicides?
- Technically, no.

11:07.327 --> 11:12.499
But even the most obvious suicide
is investigated by NClS as a murder.

11:12.749 --> 11:15.043
On a Marine base
surrounded by cameras?

11:15.251 --> 11:16.419
Yes.

11:16.586 --> 11:20.840
The stuff good mysteries
are made of, Mr. Palmer.

11:31.351 --> 11:33.895
<i>The incident shocked the
entertainment industry and the nation.</i>

11:34.062 --> 11:35.522
<i>The sudden and gruesome death</i>

11:35.688 --> 11:39.359
<i>of supermodel and recent reality star
Taylor Shane.</i>

11:39.526 --> 11:43.655
<i>The 25-year-old was found at
approximately 6: 1 0 yesterday morning</i>

11:43.822 --> 11:46.616
<i>hanging atop a barrier fence
at the Quantico Marine Base.</i>

11:46.825 --> 11:51.287
<i>Shane was at Quantico participating
in hit reality show Boot Camp Babes.</i>

11:51.454 --> 11:53.331
l'll just fast-forward to the good part.

11:56.084 --> 11:58.920
<i>Special Agent Gibbs, is the
Marine Corps attempting to cover up</i>

11:59.087 --> 12:01.923
<i>- how Taylor Shane died?
- lnterview's over.</i>

12:02.257 --> 12:05.635
<i>- But people have a right to know.
- l don't care.</i>

12:08.221 --> 12:09.514
What were you thinking?

12:09.806 --> 12:11.975
Give me a break, Jen.
l wasn't even asked that question.

12:12.142 --> 12:13.810
You're saying
they did a hatchet job on you?

12:13.977 --> 12:16.187
Yeah. Are you saying
you don't believe me?

12:17.856 --> 12:21.067
You were wrong the other day.
Some things do change.

12:21.276 --> 12:25.864
Part of our job is to make sure that
they don't creatively edit our interviews.

12:26.072 --> 12:29.701
No, that's maybe your job, director.
My job is to catch dirtbags.

12:29.909 --> 12:33.413
The Marine Corps does not need
any more bad publicity at this moment.

12:33.621 --> 12:36.332
<i>Supporting something
called Boot Camp Babes?</i>

12:36.499 --> 12:38.084
What did they think
was gonna happen?

12:38.334 --> 12:40.503
The intention of the show
was to represent

12:40.670 --> 12:43.006
that the Marines
could be a life-changing experience.

12:43.173 --> 12:45.884
Maybe in season two.
Are we done here yet?

12:46.092 --> 12:49.053
l have a dead girl downstairs
and an investigation to run.

12:49.262 --> 12:53.850
l've got an entire agency to run,
and sound bites like these do not help

12:54.017 --> 12:57.145
when the budget's under review, or
maybe you'd like to go back to the days

12:57.353 --> 12:59.731
when we had to buy our own ammo
to train on the range?

12:59.898 --> 13:02.775
You want me to help fix this?
Then get me that reporter's number.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.195
You're going to apologise?

13:05.361 --> 13:08.573
No. Ask her to dinner.

13:11.868 --> 13:15.914
There's Ducky. Ducky looks good.
There's the autopsy gremlin.

13:16.247 --> 13:18.625
There it is. Right there.
That's my jacket.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.921
Oh, that's McGee's jacket.

13:24.881 --> 13:26.800
l didn't make a single broadcast.

13:27.008 --> 13:28.426
l wish l could say the same.

13:28.635 --> 13:30.970
The camera must've added
about ten pounds to me.

13:31.179 --> 13:33.431
Actually, that was your refrigerator,
probie.

13:34.599 --> 13:36.476
You think Gibbs watched
the news last night?

13:36.684 --> 13:37.977
l know the director did.

13:38.186 --> 13:40.939
He's been up in her office
for the past half an hour.

13:42.315 --> 13:46.069
Anyone else think they were more
than just partners back in the day?

13:50.156 --> 13:52.492
<i>Hi, boss. We're just talking
about Cagney & Lacey.</i>

13:52.659 --> 13:53.785
lt's a real good show.

13:55.495 --> 13:57.122
- What do we got?
- Taylor Shane

13:57.288 --> 14:00.542
checked into the Los Angeles
Better Health Center

14:00.750 --> 14:03.503
in August of '02
and then again in May of '03.

14:03.711 --> 14:05.380
Publicist said
it was an eating disorder.

14:05.547 --> 14:07.841
But the truth is it was heroin,
cocaine and--

14:08.007 --> 14:09.342
- PCP.
- Bingo, boss.

14:09.509 --> 14:11.761
Friends have given several interviews
over the years.

14:11.970 --> 14:15.557
They blame her drug problem mostly
on the boyfriend, Noah Keller,

14:15.765 --> 14:19.018
- son of Marshall Keller.
- That guy owns half of Manhattan.

14:19.227 --> 14:20.353
His kids are loaded too.

14:20.562 --> 14:24.315
Well, this kid was arrested
for possession of illegal narcotics

14:24.524 --> 14:27.777
three times in the last five years.
Twice for cocaine, once for PCP.

14:27.986 --> 14:29.362
- Find him.
- Already on it.

14:29.571 --> 14:32.449
That executive show guy, Crawley,
he got back last night?

14:32.615 --> 14:35.994
- The term is executive producer.
- Whatever. lnterview him.

14:36.202 --> 14:38.371
l wanna know how this girl
did a fistful of PCP

14:38.538 --> 14:40.165
in the middle of his reality show.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.002
That guy dates supermodels?

14:44.210 --> 14:46.212
They're shallow, he's wealthy.
lt's a perfect match.

14:46.671 --> 14:47.964
lsn't your family wealthy?

14:48.798 --> 14:50.383
That's different.

14:50.592 --> 14:53.470
- Why?
- My dad cut me off when l was 1 2.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.472
l had to earn all my dates
the old-fashioned way.

14:55.638 --> 14:57.140
Begging?

15:11.946 --> 15:14.282
Abs, got some good news for you.
l talked to the director.

15:14.449 --> 15:15.700
Your new assistant starts Monday.

15:16.868 --> 15:20.830
No, Gibbs. No.
l can't go through that again, that--

15:22.499 --> 15:24.375
- That is so not funny.
- No?

15:24.584 --> 15:27.170
- No.
- lt was to me, kind of.

15:27.337 --> 15:29.214
Here you go. Where are we?

15:29.422 --> 15:31.508
Well, l know why no one heard
Taylor screaming

15:31.674 --> 15:34.010
when she was in the wire
the other night.

15:34.219 --> 15:37.889
Two 300-car trains passed
by OCS the same time she died.

15:38.097 --> 15:39.682
l doubt anyone
could've heard anything.

15:40.058 --> 15:42.143
- You on a new diet, Abs?
- No. According to Ducky,

15:42.352 --> 15:45.396
there were no signs
of intravenous drug use on the body,

15:45.605 --> 15:48.149
- and no traces of PCP in the lungs.
- She took it orally.

15:48.358 --> 15:51.152
But there were also no traces
of the binders and chemicals

15:51.319 --> 15:53.780
you would find
when something's taken by pill.

15:53.947 --> 15:56.616
- l guess that's what all this is about.
- You'd be guessing right.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.785
There were traces of PCP
in her stomach.

15:59.035 --> 16:01.079
There was also dextrose,
ferrous sulfate, riboflavin

16:01.246 --> 16:04.374
and other chemicals consistent
with these delectable pastries.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.334
- Which one?
- l've been trying to find out.

16:06.543 --> 16:08.711
lt's kind of fun.
lt reminds me of Bill Nye.

16:08.878 --> 16:10.380
- Who?
- Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

16:10.547 --> 16:14.884
- Wacky scientist with a kid's show?
- Oh, it's like Mr. Wizard.

16:15.260 --> 16:16.719
Who?

16:17.554 --> 16:19.806
- Never mind.
- So anyways, Bill Nye did an episode

16:19.973 --> 16:22.392
where he broke down the molecular
structure of junk food.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.812
Same thing l did today,
only Bill Nye was trying to get kids

16:25.979 --> 16:28.439
to eat healthier, and his pastries
weren't laced with PCP.

16:28.606 --> 16:30.650
- Although Bill Nye once--
- Abby, the case?

16:30.859 --> 16:33.862
Two things l know.
One, l like cream filling.

16:34.070 --> 16:37.699
And two, her last meal was this.

16:39.909 --> 16:42.620
l think we're looking at
death by Klowny Kake.

16:43.621 --> 16:45.331
That's good work, Abs.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.420
Taylor got along with everyone,
Hannah.

16:50.628 --> 16:51.880
Everyone but you.

16:52.088 --> 16:53.923
Your point is, staff sergeant?

16:54.132 --> 16:57.177
She committed suicide for a reason.
l wanna know why.

16:57.594 --> 16:58.678
How the hell would l know?

16:59.637 --> 17:02.807
You've been abusing her on and off
camera for the past two months.

17:03.016 --> 17:05.393
Oh, so it's my fault
she decided to off herself?

17:05.602 --> 17:07.604
l wanna know what happened
in this room last night.

17:08.188 --> 17:09.939
Well, let's see.

17:10.106 --> 17:11.357
l went to bed.

17:11.608 --> 17:14.986
Natalie probably snuck off two or three
times to the bathroom to throw up.

17:15.194 --> 17:17.906
And Taylor, well,

17:18.114 --> 17:21.451
she apparently decided to hang herself
from a barbed-wire fence.

17:21.951 --> 17:24.662
Anything else l can help you with,
staff sergeant?

17:27.915 --> 17:29.793
You're a real piece of work,
Bressling.

17:36.299 --> 17:39.636
Get out of my sight.
l'll see you at the pull-up bars.

17:40.011 --> 17:41.054
With pleasure.

17:44.182 --> 17:46.142
ls this a bad time, staff sergeant?

17:46.768 --> 17:50.438
No, ma'am. l'm just counting the days
till this reality show is off of my base.

17:50.647 --> 17:52.148
We need to speak
with Thomas Crawley.

17:52.315 --> 17:53.566
So do l, sir.

17:53.858 --> 17:55.235
He's asked not to be disturbed.

17:55.443 --> 17:58.279
A girl died from a drug overdose
while taping the show.

17:58.488 --> 18:00.365
Disturbing him
is not our primary concern.

18:00.740 --> 18:01.991
Taylor overdosed?

18:03.201 --> 18:06.204
- On what?
- PCP. A lot of it.

18:06.579 --> 18:08.998
That's why she tried to climb
that fence? She was on drugs?

18:09.207 --> 18:10.708
She was most likely delusional.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.670
Perhaps she thought
someone was chasing her.

18:13.837 --> 18:16.256
You know how she got the drugs,
staff sergeant?

18:17.298 --> 18:19.968
No, sir. l know she had
some problems in the past,

18:20.135 --> 18:21.511
but if anything, she was anti-drugs.

18:21.678 --> 18:23.721
Hell, she wouldn't even
take an aspirin.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.976
- Where's Crawley, staff sergeant?
- His office. lt's just outside that door.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.877
Mr. Crawley.

18:54.961 --> 18:56.463
Mr. Crawley.

18:57.255 --> 18:58.715
l'm sorry.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.634
Please.
l was thinking about my daughter.

19:02.385 --> 19:04.095
Her death just...

19:04.304 --> 19:05.889
Taylor Shane was your daughter?

19:07.599 --> 19:10.935
l became her legal guardian
when she was 1 5.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.229
We've been through
a lot together, but--

19:13.438 --> 19:15.398
Were you aware
that she had a drug problem?

19:15.607 --> 19:18.067
Taylor's been clean and sober
for over two years now.

19:18.485 --> 19:22.238
- She OD'd on PCP.
- No, no. There's no way.

19:22.405 --> 19:23.907
She would never go
through that again.

19:24.073 --> 19:27.243
Statistically,
addicts fall back in times of stress.

19:27.452 --> 19:30.205
Meaning Marine boot camp probably
wasn't the best environment for her.

19:30.371 --> 19:33.249
This entire reality series
was Taylor's idea.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.169
l've never seen her happier.
She loved it here.

19:36.377 --> 19:38.755
- How did she get the drugs?
- She didn't.

19:38.963 --> 19:42.091
The whole point of the show was to
show that she wasn't that girl anymore.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.969
Well, l'd say it backfired. Large time.

19:48.306 --> 19:50.016
lt's ''bigtime.''

19:50.225 --> 19:51.476
Get up!

19:53.019 --> 19:54.854
Let's go. Move.

19:56.022 --> 19:57.565
Come on,
show me what you're made of.

20:00.693 --> 20:02.445
Come on, now. Just two more.

20:05.281 --> 20:07.867
l can't do any more.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.620
What did l tell you
about the word ''can't,'' Bressling?

20:12.914 --> 20:15.625
Taylor's the only one who took
any of this Marine stuff seriously.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.711
But you knew that, right, sarge?

20:18.878 --> 20:21.172
- Get the cameras out of here.
- Yes, sir. Pack it up, guys.

20:21.381 --> 20:22.423
Was he here?

20:24.676 --> 20:26.219
Answer me, Hannah.

20:26.386 --> 20:27.637
You're hurting her arm, sir.

20:27.804 --> 20:29.556
My daughter's dead, staff sergeant.

20:29.722 --> 20:31.516
lf she's responsible,
l'll do more than that.

20:31.724 --> 20:34.686
Hey, no one's doing anything
around here but calming down.

20:34.894 --> 20:37.689
- Who is ''he''?
- Noah Keller, Taylor's ex.

20:37.897 --> 20:41.734
- Noah Keller, he was here?
- Couple of days ago. Big deal.

20:41.943 --> 20:44.112
- Did you know this?
- No, sir.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.573
Staff sergeant, can you take
Mr. Crawley for a walk?

20:46.739 --> 20:48.450
We need to talk to the girls alone.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.744
- You need to let NClS handle this.
- l'll talk to you when they're done.

20:51.953 --> 20:54.205
We'll be here, Tom. We don't wrap
for another three days.

20:57.417 --> 21:01.421
- ls that Berry Mango Madness?
- Yes.

21:01.963 --> 21:04.674
We haven't had anything
but Marine food since we got here.

21:04.883 --> 21:07.594
- l'll give you 1 00 bucks for it.
- lt's not for sale.

21:08.636 --> 21:12.015
lt's free. Just like love.

21:12.223 --> 21:15.351
You know, l'm a big fan of the show.
You guys are really beautiful and great.

21:15.518 --> 21:18.271
- The show is excellent.
- Thanks, cutie.

21:21.357 --> 21:24.235
Why didn't you tell me that
Taylor's boyfriend had visited her?

21:24.861 --> 21:26.529
She made us promise
not to say anything.

21:26.738 --> 21:28.865
Well, you know, she's dead,
so l don't think she'll mind.

21:29.073 --> 21:30.492
You saw the way Tom reacted.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.244
He hates Noah.
He blames him for Taylor's drug habit.

21:33.661 --> 21:35.038
Was she using while she was here?

21:35.747 --> 21:37.874
Considering
we're in a Marine boot camp? No.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.375
None of us have used any drugs.

21:39.584 --> 21:41.044
Noah just came to talk to her.

21:41.252 --> 21:44.047
They were having
some relationship problems.

21:46.966 --> 21:48.510
Taylor thought he was using again.

21:52.806 --> 21:54.724
- What?
- Well, it just makes sense.

21:56.059 --> 21:58.394
Someone gave her enough PCP
to kill the three of you.

22:01.523 --> 22:03.525
When was the last time
you heard from Mr. Keller?

22:03.691 --> 22:06.986
- Hang up the phone, McGee.
- Boss, l got Noah Keller's accountant.

22:07.779 --> 22:09.697
He's at the Cranston Motel
in Triangle, Virginia,

22:09.906 --> 22:11.908
right outside the main gate
of Quantico.

22:13.076 --> 22:16.162
- How'd you track him down?
- l got a call from the president.

22:17.705 --> 22:20.208
His Amex records
were in the fax machine, McGee.

22:20.583 --> 22:24.295
- Come on.
- l specifically told her to e-mail those.

22:29.092 --> 22:31.678
Millions of dollars,
a supermodel girlfriend,

22:31.845 --> 22:33.221
and this is where he stays.

22:33.429 --> 22:34.764
Well, he showed up in style.

22:34.973 --> 22:37.725
- l would've rather slept in the car.
- That one.

22:37.934 --> 22:39.602
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Boss.</i>

22:39.811 --> 22:42.438
Noah Keller was in Quantico
the day before Taylor Shane died.

22:44.566 --> 22:46.985
Yeah. l see him now, DiNozzo.

22:47.986 --> 22:49.863
Don't bother, McGee.

23:01.207 --> 23:03.960
A young person's death
is never easy, McGee.

23:04.210 --> 23:08.756
But two in 24 hours,
and both self-inflicted. Well, that's...

23:09.466 --> 23:11.468
- ...tragic.
- He got off easy, Duck.

23:11.634 --> 23:14.137
The drugs he gave his girlfriend
had her thrashing herself to death

23:14.345 --> 23:15.889
in a barbed-wire fence.

23:16.639 --> 23:19.767
These people can have everything,
and this is how they end up?

23:20.018 --> 23:24.939
Well, wealth and fame have often gone
hand in hand with fatal addiction.

23:25.148 --> 23:28.401
- Edgar Allen Poe, Keith Moon.
- Kurt Cobain.

23:28.568 --> 23:30.904
Yeah, the list goes on and on.

23:31.070 --> 23:34.032
No, this one's been dead
about 24 hours, Jethro.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.744
Well, that means he offed himself
the same night his girlfriend OD'd.

23:37.952 --> 23:41.748
The froth around the mouth suggests
a breakdown of the nervous system.

23:42.165 --> 23:43.416
PCP?

23:43.583 --> 23:45.710
Yeah, possible, but not probable.
Look.

23:46.044 --> 23:49.964
Pinpoint pupils, blue discoloration
around the fingernails.

23:50.173 --> 23:53.593
No, l'd say his death
was the result of diacetylmorphine.

23:54.219 --> 23:55.678
Heroin?

23:55.887 --> 23:58.973
- Yeah.
- l would say you're right, Ducky.

24:01.684 --> 24:03.228
That a suicide note?

24:03.978 --> 24:05.230
Not exactly.

24:05.772 --> 24:09.442
''lt's time for us to realise that this
just isn't meant to be.

24:09.609 --> 24:12.487
Please know that it was never
my intention to hurt you.

24:12.695 --> 24:15.490
l will always remember
the great times we've had.''

24:15.698 --> 24:17.617
This is a Dear John letter.

24:17.867 --> 24:20.286
Postmarked six days ago
from Quantico post office.

24:20.495 --> 24:22.122
Handwriting checks out.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.249
Taylor Shane sent it.

24:24.457 --> 24:27.210
Yeah. Noah Keller came by
to chat about it.

24:27.418 --> 24:29.295
Very Romeo and Juliet.

24:29.504 --> 24:33.383
Except for the part where he feeds her
a toxic Klowny Kake and offs himself.

24:33.883 --> 24:36.427
This must've been a very difficult
letter for her to write.

24:37.011 --> 24:38.388
Probably harder for him to read.

24:38.555 --> 24:41.141
No one likes getting dumped
by postal express.

24:41.391 --> 24:43.101
Maybe he didn't listen.

24:43.309 --> 24:47.397
Relationships change. Some people
don't know when to let go.

24:50.483 --> 24:53.820
l have to brief the C.G. of Quantico
first thing in the morning on this,

24:54.028 --> 24:55.738
and l'd like you to be there
when l do that.

24:56.448 --> 24:58.992
Negative, Jen. All we have
is circumstantial evidence so far.

24:59.159 --> 25:01.786
We don't even have anything to tie
the two deaths together yet.

25:01.953 --> 25:05.123
l can't call the general
and tell him we have nothing.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.918
You can always write him a letter.

25:14.591 --> 25:16.176
Abby.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.344
Abs?

25:26.686 --> 25:27.854
They're for you.

25:29.564 --> 25:30.690
They're really black.

25:31.191 --> 25:34.778
- Really, really black.
- lt's pretty cool, huh?

25:34.986 --> 25:36.696
Yeah.

25:38.573 --> 25:41.201
- ''Get well soon''?
- They didn't have a card that said:

25:41.367 --> 25:43.870
''Sorry l almost sent you to prison''
at the flower shop.

25:44.287 --> 25:47.290
Almost?
You actually did send me to prison.

25:47.499 --> 25:49.626
Well, not for good.

25:52.003 --> 25:55.840
Abby. l don't know what to say,
Abby, these--

25:56.049 --> 25:58.676
Just say that you don't hate me.

25:59.511 --> 26:01.346
l could never hate you.

26:01.554 --> 26:03.389
l don't think anyone
could ever hate you.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.600
Oh, you don't know Billy Bob.

26:06.309 --> 26:10.021
- You gave him black roses?
- No. l gave him two black eyes.

26:10.230 --> 26:11.940
He tried to run over me
with a Harley Fat Boy

26:12.107 --> 26:13.983
when l was sleeping
in the living room.

26:14.192 --> 26:16.194
A guy rode a motorcycle
through your living room?

26:16.361 --> 26:19.572
Yeah. No.
Well, it was his living room, my Harley.

26:19.864 --> 26:23.493
Billy Bob had intimacy issues.

26:25.578 --> 26:28.331
Don't forget to water them,
or they'll die.

26:28.915 --> 26:31.334
l thought they already were dead.

26:32.752 --> 26:35.255
''Laugh now, cry later.''

26:35.547 --> 26:38.133
That's an interesting concept,
Mr. Palmer.

26:38.341 --> 26:42.137
Unfortunately for our guest here,
the laughter has ended.

26:42.345 --> 26:46.766
My friend who went to NYU said this
guy was the club king of New York.

26:46.933 --> 26:48.351
He was almost legendary.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.437
Well, if he wasn't before,
he most certainly is now.

26:51.646 --> 26:54.774
And apparently, he only hung out
with models and A-list celebrities.

26:54.941 --> 26:57.152
This guy got the VlP treatment
everywhere he went.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.404
You writing a gossip column,
Palmer?

26:59.612 --> 27:05.243
Oh, l was just informing Dr. Mallard
that he'd-- We-- l--

27:05.577 --> 27:07.745
- Talk to me, Duck.
- Our initial assumptions

27:07.912 --> 27:09.205
were far from correct.

27:09.414 --> 27:12.292
When l examined him just now,
l found fresh bruises

27:12.459 --> 27:14.294
on his upper back, the left shoulder.

27:14.461 --> 27:19.632
The x-rays indicated a severe fracture
of the left scapula and a clavicle

27:19.799 --> 27:23.636
- that was almost completely crushed.
- He was in a fight?

27:23.803 --> 27:28.475
lnjuries of that nature, his left arm
would be completely useless.

27:28.683 --> 27:30.268
Someone else shot him up.

27:30.477 --> 27:33.646
Well, Abby's tox screen
showed that Mr. Keller

27:33.813 --> 27:36.900
had a blood alcohol level of 0.34.

27:37.108 --> 27:39.611
His heart was pumping so slowly

27:39.819 --> 27:42.822
that most of the heroin
was never even metabolized.

27:43.323 --> 27:45.158
He was passed out.

27:45.325 --> 27:48.119
Yes, l'm afraid our young man
was unconscious

27:48.286 --> 27:50.705
when the drug was administered.

28:08.515 --> 28:09.641
From Abby?

28:12.519 --> 28:15.230
l thought this show
was just mindless entertainment.

28:15.939 --> 28:19.192
lt's called research, Tony.
And l'm merely looking for a lead.

28:19.359 --> 28:21.486
Well, this is only the beginning.

28:21.694 --> 28:23.530
Before you know it,
you'll be sitting at home

28:23.738 --> 28:25.365
eating a large box of chocolates,

28:25.532 --> 28:28.243
watching the Food Network
on your 50-inch plasma.

28:28.451 --> 28:31.329
We're not all so easily corrupted.
Take McGee, for example.

28:31.538 --> 28:33.373
He's been raised in America
his entire life,

28:33.540 --> 28:36.876
and he rarely turns the television on.
Tell him, McGee.

28:37.043 --> 28:38.628
Yeah, tell him, McGee.

28:40.672 --> 28:43.716
Well, depends
what you consider rarely.

28:43.883 --> 28:46.010
l might watch 20 minutes
here or there.

28:46.219 --> 28:48.680
Tell her what you do
the rest of the time, probie.

28:48.888 --> 28:49.973
That's not TV.

28:50.974 --> 28:53.893
He pretends to be a fairy
in an online computer game.

28:54.144 --> 28:55.186
lt's an elf lord.

28:55.979 --> 28:57.063
Whatever.

28:58.356 --> 29:00.400
Keller didn't commit suicide,
he was murdered.

29:03.528 --> 29:05.697
What the hell are you two doing?
Find out why.

29:06.856 --> 29:08.274
Hey, l gotta call you back.

29:08.983 --> 29:11.319
Boss, l think
l might have something.

29:15.281 --> 29:18.034
Are you waiting for me to guess,
Elf Lord?

29:19.035 --> 29:23.289
No, sorry. l was searching through
Noah Keller's cell-phone records.

29:23.497 --> 29:25.374
The night that he died,
he received three calls.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.753
Two were from his business manager,
the other was from Hannah Bressling.

29:31.047 --> 29:33.299
l've known Noah since high school.

29:33.507 --> 29:35.968
We used to sneak into the Limelight,
like, every weekend.

29:36.510 --> 29:41.891
- Limelight, that's that club in Chelsea.
- Yeah, you've been?

29:43.351 --> 29:45.728
Actually, no, l...

29:45.895 --> 29:47.688
<i>l saw it on Wild On.</i>

29:48.814 --> 29:51.192
Sounded like it was
a pretty exclusive place.

29:51.692 --> 29:54.737
Even as a kid, Noah seemed to know
all the right people.

29:54.904 --> 29:57.281
l don't think he waited in line
his entire life.

29:57.573 --> 30:00.660
Money tends to open doors.

30:01.035 --> 30:02.828
No, he didn't use his dad's money
as a crutch.

30:03.246 --> 30:04.288
Really?

30:04.497 --> 30:06.249
Yeah, everyone always assumed
he was popular

30:06.415 --> 30:10.169
only because he was rich, and that
that was the reason he dated models.

30:10.711 --> 30:12.255
l'm sure it didn't hurt.

30:12.421 --> 30:15.758
No, women liked Noah because
he was charismatic and interesting.

30:15.925 --> 30:19.053
l mean, most guys that come
from money are womanizers

30:19.262 --> 30:20.846
whose life revolves around their car.

30:23.891 --> 30:25.935
Were you and Noah Keller
ever an item?

30:26.352 --> 30:28.938
We dated on and off
for a couple years,

30:29.105 --> 30:31.357
but we sort of lost touch
when he hooked up with Taylor.

30:31.566 --> 30:34.610
When did he get involved
with drugs?

30:35.319 --> 30:38.656
People say he got her started,
but it's not true.

30:38.823 --> 30:40.408
They both made that leap together.

30:40.616 --> 30:43.286
Did you speak to him
when he came to see Taylor?

30:43.953 --> 30:46.789
No. He was drunk and really upset.

30:47.707 --> 30:51.627
But l called him later that night
just to make sure that he was safe.

30:56.799 --> 31:00.136
l just can't imagine why anyone
would've wanted to hurt him.

31:05.141 --> 31:06.267
What are you doing?

31:06.684 --> 31:10.146
l just stopped by to drop you
something off, Jethro.

31:10.354 --> 31:13.149
Looked to me like
you were playing agent.

31:13.482 --> 31:15.985
l left you four messages today.

31:16.235 --> 31:17.486
Really?

31:17.653 --> 31:19.113
l only got three.

31:19.322 --> 31:22.158
Keller's death was a murder,
not suicide.

31:22.408 --> 31:24.619
That's something
l should probably know.

31:24.827 --> 31:26.913
lt sounds like you do.

31:27.914 --> 31:30.249
This case is getting more attention
by the hour.

31:30.458 --> 31:33.794
l trust that you will keep me
informed?

31:34.462 --> 31:36.088
Trust is a two-way street.

31:36.756 --> 31:39.508
What are you saying, Jethro?
You don't trust me?

31:49.769 --> 31:52.271
Of course, l trust you.

31:52.855 --> 31:54.315
ls that all?

31:55.816 --> 31:57.360
For now.

32:00.655 --> 32:01.906
l can save you the trouble.

32:02.073 --> 32:06.160
On today's Channel 6 News,
per Director Shepard's demands,

32:06.369 --> 32:10.539
Cynthia Sanchez issued a retraction
on Monday's story.

32:10.790 --> 32:13.501
She was also forced
to issue a public apology

32:13.668 --> 32:17.046
to one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.927
Our director has friends
in high places, yes?

32:23.135 --> 32:26.305
Something l can do for you,
Officer David?

32:27.056 --> 32:30.560
Abby needs to see you.
Said she found something.

32:30.810 --> 32:32.895
<i>l looked through all
the Boot Camp Babe footage</i>

32:33.062 --> 32:36.065
from the night Taylor Shane died.
She was nowhere to be seen.

32:36.232 --> 32:38.818
She knew where the cameras
were placed, knew how to avoid them.

32:39.026 --> 32:42.363
Not all of them.
A few minutes ago, l found this.

32:42.822 --> 32:46.242
lt's from a Quantico security camera
placed on top of the mess hall.

32:46.492 --> 32:49.745
This video was taken about two hours
before Taylor Shane died.

32:49.996 --> 32:52.915
l presume not many people stroll
around Quantico at 1 a.m.

32:53.082 --> 32:55.042
- Can you zoom in, Abs?
- My new enhancement program

32:55.251 --> 32:56.586
is booting up as we speak.

32:57.712 --> 33:00.089
l've been waiting for the chance
to bust out this bad boy.

33:01.591 --> 33:04.343
This should clear it up a bit.

33:09.473 --> 33:11.517
Taylor was with
Staff Sergeant McMannis?

33:21.777 --> 33:23.946
When's Gibbs planning on starting?

33:24.113 --> 33:26.949
- This is one of his techniques.
- Really?

33:27.116 --> 33:29.994
Leaves the guy alone
in a cold, dimly lit room.

33:30.202 --> 33:33.497
And then, just as the guy
starts to zone out,

33:34.457 --> 33:37.418
he bursts in the door and rifles off
some questions.

33:37.627 --> 33:41.005
l call it ''rock the baby.''

33:41.589 --> 33:43.633
l see. And does it work?

33:44.383 --> 33:46.010
Just watch.

33:46.218 --> 33:48.638
ln a few moments,
that door is gonna fly open

33:48.804 --> 33:52.558
and this big, bad Marine
is gonna jump like a little girl.

33:56.812 --> 33:59.065
What the hell's with you, DiNozzo?

34:00.107 --> 34:02.902
l was just telling Ziva
about your interrogation techniques.

34:03.110 --> 34:06.072
l'm not interrogating McMannis.
You are.

34:06.656 --> 34:09.533
Thanks, boss. l could've used
a little more prep time, but that's--

34:09.742 --> 34:12.578
l'm not talking to you, DiNozzo.

34:12.828 --> 34:16.040
He is all yours, Officer David.

34:16.498 --> 34:19.752
You are aware that l've never
performed an interrogation

34:19.960 --> 34:22.672
without inflicting some sort of pain?

34:30.012 --> 34:33.181
This footage was pulled
from a Quantico security camera.

34:33.431 --> 34:35.935
lt was taken at 01 1 7

34:36.143 --> 34:38.688
the morning Taylor Shane
was murdered.

34:39.021 --> 34:40.273
That's an interesting technique.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.315
She doesn't wanna tempt herself.

34:42.483 --> 34:44.694
Tell me what you know,
staff sergeant.

34:44.860 --> 34:46.152
Okay if l dip, ma'am?

34:48.947 --> 34:50.992
Promised Taylor l'd quit.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.994
We're both addicted to nicotine.

34:54.870 --> 34:56.956
Supermodel who spits tobacco?

34:58.124 --> 34:59.959
She smoked.

35:00.710 --> 35:03.212
But it's against the rules
at boot camp.

35:04.046 --> 35:06.299
So you supplied her
with your snuff there?

35:07.550 --> 35:09.385
Yes, ma'am.

35:09.969 --> 35:11.554
And junk food?

35:13.514 --> 35:17.393
- Sometimes.
- And the midnight walks?

35:17.852 --> 35:20.354
You did that with every girl,
staff sergeant?

35:21.230 --> 35:23.691
No, just Taylor.

35:24.567 --> 35:28.321
We didn't want anybody to find out
about us until the show ended.

35:30.740 --> 35:32.533
Find out what?

35:34.702 --> 35:35.995
That we were in love, ma'am.

35:37.914 --> 35:39.749
This is the worst defence
imaginable.

35:40.207 --> 35:42.919
The idea of a supermodel
falling in love with a guy like this.

35:43.377 --> 35:45.004
Okay, why's that?

35:45.212 --> 35:46.923
Well, it's absolutely ridiculous,
you know?

35:47.173 --> 35:48.841
Supermodels date guys
like George Clooney,

35:49.050 --> 35:51.385
or guys with George Clooney's
bank account,

35:51.594 --> 35:53.262
or, of course,
the actual George Clooney,

35:53.429 --> 35:56.766
but not guys like this.
They don't date guys like this.

35:58.184 --> 36:02.271
- Definitely not guys like this.
- Meaning Marines, DiNozzo?

36:04.398 --> 36:07.777
No, l didn't say that.
l mean, l would never say that.

36:08.694 --> 36:11.781
He thought l meant Marines.

36:12.031 --> 36:14.283
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- l've got something for you, Gibbs.</i>

36:14.867 --> 36:18.037
l'll be right there.
Abby's got something.

36:20.748 --> 36:23.292
Hey. You were a lot of help.

36:27.129 --> 36:32.635
Taylor was nothing like her reputation.
She was normal, like a regular girl.

36:32.802 --> 36:36.055
l know it sounds weird, but l fell in love
with her the moment l met her.

36:36.681 --> 36:38.808
And she felt the same way?

36:39.642 --> 36:42.562
We were gonna get married
once the show ended.

36:42.979 --> 36:46.482
She was done with modelling.
She was sick of the whole lifestyle.

36:47.441 --> 36:48.776
And the reason you failed
to mention

36:48.943 --> 36:51.487
you were with her
a few hours before she died?

36:54.574 --> 36:55.950
Who'd have believed me, ma'am?

36:57.577 --> 36:59.704
Hell, it was my life.

36:59.912 --> 37:01.289
Barely believe it myself.

37:02.456 --> 37:03.499
l believe you.

37:04.834 --> 37:06.419
You do?

37:08.462 --> 37:09.839
So l'm free to go?

37:10.631 --> 37:12.174
No.

37:13.259 --> 37:15.011
l think we will charge you
with murder instead.

37:17.013 --> 37:19.265
But you said
you believed me, ma'am.

37:19.432 --> 37:22.143
l would never, ever have done
anything to hurt her.

37:22.810 --> 37:25.187
What about the man who supplied
the drugs that killed her?

37:26.147 --> 37:27.231
Noah Keller?

37:30.151 --> 37:33.487
Answer the question, staff sergeant.

37:34.697 --> 37:36.032
l'm not feeling too well, ma'am.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.789
This is the final wardrobe
of Taylor Shane.

37:43.998 --> 37:46.876
- l couldn't imagine a worse way to go.
- l could.

37:47.376 --> 37:49.170
She planted herself
on a barbed-wire fence.

37:49.378 --> 37:50.671
What could possibly be worse?

37:50.838 --> 37:52.548
My top three are falling
into a wood chipper,

37:52.798 --> 37:54.634
drowning in lava
and being eaten by a shark.

37:55.384 --> 37:58.971
- l'm guessing you thought about this.
- On and off for the last 25 years.

37:59.388 --> 38:02.141
l read a statistic says you're more likely
to be struck by lightning

38:02.350 --> 38:03.392
than attacked by a shark.

38:03.643 --> 38:05.061
Not if you're a seal.

38:05.895 --> 38:07.730
- What do we have, Abs?
- l broke down the origin

38:07.897 --> 38:10.149
of each and every stain
on Taylor's clothes.

38:10.358 --> 38:13.069
- Most were blood, mud, rust, sweat.
- Most?

38:13.319 --> 38:16.906
Yes. This stain here, under the collar,
has traces of PCP

38:17.073 --> 38:19.909
mixed with formaldehyde, sodium
and nicotine.

38:20.701 --> 38:22.203
- Tobacco.
- Yep.

38:22.495 --> 38:24.997
The PCP wasn't laced
in the Klowny Kake.

38:25.206 --> 38:28.668
lt was laced in this.

38:31.921 --> 38:34.340
Are you sure you don't want
some more water, staff sergeant?

38:37.343 --> 38:41.264
- l have to leave here now.
- Sit down, staff sergeant.

38:43.516 --> 38:46.102
What are you doing to me?

38:50.565 --> 38:52.525
l believe Officer David
asked you to sit down.

38:53.859 --> 38:57.446
You did this to me.
You're trying to destroy me!

39:10.835 --> 39:13.212
- Guy just went crazy, boss.
- He's OD'ing on PCP.

39:13.421 --> 39:14.714
Get a medical team in here.

39:16.090 --> 39:17.550
Where'd you get
the chew, sergeant?

39:19.176 --> 39:21.762
- Sergeant!
- From the show.

39:22.805 --> 39:25.683
- What's happening to me, sir?
- You've been drugged.

39:26.976 --> 39:28.227
But you'll be all right now.

39:29.562 --> 39:31.147
Hush.

39:35.818 --> 39:37.778
This is what l would call
some serious snuff.

39:38.487 --> 39:42.074
The staff sergeant's chew was laced
with 400 milligrams of PCP.

39:42.283 --> 39:45.870
A typical hit for a user would be
between seven and ten milligrams.

39:46.078 --> 39:48.831
l knew that dude couldn't have
taken me if he wasn't juiced.

39:48.998 --> 39:50.249
What are his chances, Abby?

39:50.458 --> 39:52.376
lt depends on how much
PCP he ingested.

39:52.835 --> 39:54.253
How long was he dipping?

39:55.922 --> 39:57.173
That long, huh?

39:57.340 --> 39:59.300
Let's hope he has better luck
than Taylor Shane.

39:59.508 --> 40:01.344
Okay, great. Thank you.

40:01.510 --> 40:03.679
Staff Sergeant McMannis
is stable at Bethesda.

40:03.846 --> 40:05.973
- Still in critical condition.
- Any prints?

40:06.182 --> 40:08.392
l was able to lift two latent prints.

40:10.603 --> 40:12.396
One matches
Staff Sergeant McMannis.

40:12.605 --> 40:14.357
- And the other?
- No owner yet.

40:14.523 --> 40:18.486
But it does match a print lifted
from Noah Keller's syringe.

40:18.694 --> 40:20.696
Whoever killed Taylor killed Keller.

40:24.158 --> 40:26.077
What's that for?

40:26.786 --> 40:29.705
- lt's a fingerprint kit.
- Why?

40:30.206 --> 40:33.292
Someone tried to kill
Staff Sergeant McMannis today.

40:34.293 --> 40:36.545
His chewing tobacco
was laced with PCP.

40:36.796 --> 40:38.631
Whoever did it
left a print on the can.

40:38.839 --> 40:41.217
The same person who murdered
Taylor Shane and Noah Keller.

40:41.467 --> 40:44.679
- Whoa, you think it was one of us?
- Oh, we know it was one of you.

40:45.096 --> 40:46.347
You were jealous of her, Hannah.

40:46.514 --> 40:48.224
You're the one who introduced her
to Keller.

40:48.432 --> 40:52.228
Me, jealous of a crackhead?
Please, Tom, you're stretching it a bit.

40:52.395 --> 40:54.355
But why would we?
That doesn't make any sense.

40:54.730 --> 40:57.692
Taylor Shane was in love
with the staff sergeant.

40:58.359 --> 41:02.697
- Yeah, right. You've got to be joking.
- No, we're not.

41:02.905 --> 41:05.241
Well, then, fingerprint away,
sweetheart. lt wasn't me.

41:05.449 --> 41:07.577
We don't need it.
They're already in your arrest record.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.872
From the time you beat up your
assistant with your phone, l believe.

41:12.498 --> 41:14.375
Well, it wasn't me.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.419
Nope. We've got yours too.

41:16.586 --> 41:18.254
Yeah, remember that time you drove
your SUV

41:18.462 --> 41:19.880
through the front of the Limelight?

41:24.969 --> 41:26.095
What is this?

41:28.514 --> 41:30.766
l loved Taylor.

41:32.059 --> 41:34.395
l'm not giving you permission
to take my fingerprints.

41:34.604 --> 41:36.105
l'm gonna talk to my lawyer first.

41:36.272 --> 41:39.108
We don't need anybody's permission.
You're under arrest for murder.

41:39.358 --> 41:41.736
You didn't want her to give up
her career to marry a Marine,

41:41.944 --> 41:43.446
but you couldn't stop her.

41:43.613 --> 41:45.865
Too bad she was addicted
to nicotine too.

41:46.741 --> 41:49.285
You killed your own daughter?

41:49.452 --> 41:52.079
lt was an accident!
What was l supposed to do?

41:52.288 --> 41:54.290
She was gonna throw her life away,
be some--

41:54.498 --> 41:56.626
Be some jarhead's housewife.

41:58.794 --> 42:00.796
Thanks, Tom.

42:03.507 --> 42:05.092
What's so funny, honey?

42:05.301 --> 42:08.888
The ratings on this one
will really be through the roof.

42:09.805 --> 42:12.266
Ziva, no. No, no, no.

42:13.601 --> 42:16.145
- You really find her attractive?
- Oh, yeah.

42:16.395 --> 42:17.521
Well, l want to shoot her.

42:20.566 --> 42:22.652
Tony, it's a matter of opinion.
How can it be wrong?

42:22.902 --> 42:26.447
Exactly. lt's a matter of you
having the wrong opinion.

42:26.656 --> 42:30.159
- Why don't you two agree to disagree?
- l don't agree to that.

42:30.326 --> 42:34.163
Boss, the director's new hair,
you like the way she cut it? Short?

42:35.498 --> 42:36.624
She cut her hair?

42:37.792 --> 42:38.834
Never mind.

42:48.261 --> 42:50.304
l don't suppose you want this.

42:54.684 --> 42:56.352
l'll get rid of it.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.564
Go home, DiNozzo. lt's late.

43:00.273 --> 43:02.525
Yeah, l'm just finishing up
a couple things.

43:04.318 --> 43:05.861
Your flowers are dead.
