00:01.502 --> 00:02.636
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.405
I blackmailed them.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.274
All of them.
The donors.

00:06.307 --> 00:09.610
- What do you want?
- I've done enough.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.479
- They blackmailed you too,
didn't they?

00:11.512 --> 00:16.250
Your mom, she passed.
They said she went peacefully.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.286
- I married your sister, Sarah.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.689
Don't you wanna just scream
in your family's face,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.524
"I exist"?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.369
- Of course I do, but you can't
change other people.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.095
- I'm doing 8R.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.430
I'm climbing the rungs
with Richard and Felicia.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.665
- Hi.
- Ashley, hi.

00:31.699 --> 00:36.137
- How's Hawk?
- He's living in the city.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.473
- Everything I said up there
was about you.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.314

02:16.704 --> 02:18.639
- Excuse me.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.808
Are you serving breakfast yet?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.576
It's just that I'm starving.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.279
Not until 6:00.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.714
Do you know what, hon?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.616
They're setting up the buffet.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.752
Why don't you help yourself
to something off there?

02:31.785 --> 02:34.788
- Oh, that's great.
- Thank you.

02:34.822 --> 02:41.762
*

02:49.770 --> 02:52.506
Marshall.
What are you doing here?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.242
- Hey, this is
a funny coincidence.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.643
I deliver meat to this place.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.411
- But your meat is...

02:57.445 --> 02:58.846
- Poisoned?

03:00.581 --> 03:03.651
- I'm sorry
we couldn't help you.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.954
At sundown, we start our
three-day process of Restitution

03:06.987 --> 03:08.956
and you'll be in my prayers.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.392
- Little late for that now.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.361
Be sure and try the bacon.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.697
- I don't eat meat.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.432
- Well, but it's my meat.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.601
It'd mean a lot to me
if you did.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.506
- I suppose if I try it,
I can atone for it later.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.675
- You keep my secret,
I'll keep yours.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.982
Mm.
Mm.

03:35.015 --> 03:41.989
*

04:07.448 --> 04:14.388
*

04:26.500 --> 04:28.636
Sarah Lane outright blackmailed

04:28.669 --> 04:31.839
at least 15
current and former Meyerists.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.074
Now each one of these people
that wrote a check

04:34.107 --> 04:36.610
are hiding a secret.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.379
They have that secret on tape.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.748
If I can get a few of them
to come forward,

04:40.781 --> 04:43.384
we can shut
this whole thing down.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.685
- This is great.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.887
- Yeah.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.556
- What?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.726
- A bunch of immoral,
reprehensible people

04:52.760 --> 04:54.628
get to walk away scot-free.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.730
Secrets intact.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.466
- Must be hard.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.933
Be undercover like you are.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.470
Probably lose track
of up from down.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.007
- You just hope
you're fighting the good fight.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.009
Putting Sarah Lane behind bars

05:09.042 --> 05:11.679
so she can't take advantage
of people's trust?

05:11.712 --> 05:14.014
Sounds like a good fight to me.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.354
*

05:22.390 --> 05:24.558
- That's so cool.
- You're at NYU.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.827
- Yeah, I mean, it's just
a summer writing program.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.362
- Still.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.864
- I have to work, like,
four jobs for it, but...

05:30.898 --> 05:34.402
- But next year, you'll get in
for real, though, right?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.737
- Yeah, if I get a boatload
of financial aid.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.539
- You'll get it.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.945
- So that girl from the bus
last night...

05:44.978 --> 05:46.514
Is she your girlfriend?

05:46.547 --> 05:49.550
- No, no, she's... just a friend.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.023
Do you have a boyfriend?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.691
- Nope.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.031
Did you tell her who I am?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.403
How did you find me?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.839
- Um, your dad came
into the diner where I work

06:11.872 --> 06:14.107
and I asked where you were.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.876
- What was he doing there?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.845
- Just having coffee.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.918
- I haven't talked to him
in a while.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.887
- Yeah, he said that.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.491
- What else did he say?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.560
- Just that he misses you.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.598
- Um...

06:37.631 --> 06:40.501
I don't have a lot of time
today,

06:40.534 --> 06:43.637
but... would you...

06:43.671 --> 06:47.775
wanna get breakfast
with me or something?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.611
- Yeah, I'd love to.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.051
- It's a cute place.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.755
I don't know about that.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.091
- For a guy
who just got out of a cult.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.895
- Well, thank you,
then, I guess.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.130
- So my dad thinks
you're some kind of messiah now.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.032
Uh...

07:12.065 --> 07:16.169
- You know, crazy people get
what they think is stigmata.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.738
It's totally psychosomatic.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.248
I mean, when I was growing up
in The Movement,

07:19.272 --> 07:20.941
people left their bodies,

07:20.974 --> 07:22.976
they had all sorts of other
religious experiences.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.613
Even I did, but obviously,
it wasn't real.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.515
- No.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.182
I don't know
what happened to my back.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.652
You know, it could have
just been the wound.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.086
I don't know.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.224
- You know,
I've been thinking a lot

07:37.257 --> 07:39.927
about what you were saying,
and I think it's outrageous

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
that no one in my family
has looked at me

07:41.829 --> 07:43.931
except for my dad
in over 20 years.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.265
- It is.
- I don't...

07:45.298 --> 07:47.200
How can you reject your kids
like that?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.937
- I don't know,
but imagine if 20 of us,

07:49.970 --> 07:53.073
ten of us, even,
walk onto that compound

07:53.106 --> 07:56.510
and say, we exist,

07:56.544 --> 07:59.613
we are not invisible,
we did not disappear.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.715
We are living, breathing
human beings

08:01.749 --> 08:03.917
with all the pain
they have caused

08:03.951 --> 08:07.588
to their sons,
daughters, mothers...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.557
- Ex-husbands.
- Yes, ex-husbands.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.859
But at least with me,
Sarah was willing

08:11.892 --> 08:14.094
to let me see the kids
after I left.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.798
You know, she will have our back
once we force the change.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.900
- You can't.
- You can't force the change.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.703
- Sarah can.
- She's co-guardian of The Light.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.805
- What? Really? Sarah?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.008
- Yeah, Sarah's the most devout
person that I know.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.276
- Really?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.845
- Yes, and she will be
the best thing

08:31.879 --> 08:33.614
that has happened
to The Movement

08:33.647 --> 08:36.049
once she gets out
from under Cal's influence.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.052
- Wow, Mom must love that.
- Her own daughter.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.221
They don't know anything,
you know.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.091
No one in my family has a clue
how two-faced they all are.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.964
- Tessa, slow down...
- You know, you're right.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.303
I'm gonna go in there.
I should go in there.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.062
And I should force them to look

08:49.096 --> 08:50.864
at the pain and the hurt
and the suffering.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.901
I should force them
to take a look at themselves.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.869
Guardian of the fucking Light!

08:55.903 --> 08:57.113
- You're right, you're right,
you're right.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.007
- But this needs to be done right.
- No.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.975
- We need to find others.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.845
We are more powerful as a group

09:04.878 --> 09:09.950
because this is about all of us,
the future of Meyerism.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.118
We need more time.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.622
- Fuck time.
- Okay?

09:21.161 --> 09:24.297
Fuck me.

09:24.331 --> 09:31.271
*

09:53.293 --> 10:00.233
*

10:06.273 --> 10:08.375
- Sarah?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.144
I'll be right there.

10:11.178 --> 10:18.151
*

10:18.185 --> 10:21.789
- We were amazing last night.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.156
On stage, I mean.

10:25.258 --> 10:29.730
But... the audience liked us,
I think.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.665
I felt...

10:31.699 --> 10:36.069
the doors opening.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.939
The people that will be
drawn to us

10:38.972 --> 10:43.811
as we leave some of the more...

10:43.844 --> 10:46.179
religious aspects
of Meyerism behind,

10:46.213 --> 10:50.150
focus more on individual growth.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.057
Hey.
How are you?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.258
- Tired.

10:59.860 --> 11:05.733
*

11:05.766 --> 11:06.934
Sarah.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.406
I feel good about this.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.408
Us.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.045
*

11:18.078 --> 11:20.013
- We should go.

11:32.525 --> 11:39.466
*

11:50.978 --> 11:53.113
- It's so god to have her back.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.849
- It sure is.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.993
- Okay, Mom,
please stop petting me.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.127
- Ha.
- I missed you.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.862
I'm allowed to miss you.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.265
- Hey, kiddo!

12:12.299 --> 12:13.400
Oh!

12:13.433 --> 12:14.534
How'd it go?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.803
- It was good.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.904
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.006
- Mommy!
- I missed you.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.508
- Oh!
- How was the conference?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.777
- Great.
- Did they like you guys?

12:23.811 --> 12:25.278
- How could they not?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.880
Your mom is an inspiration.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.882
- I want details.
- I'll tell you later.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.951
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.253
- Hey, Noa, where's Hawk?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.188
- He said he had to do something
in the city.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.924
He'll be here by sundown.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.525
I painted this for you.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.427
- Oh!
- For your Transgress.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.262
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
- Can you paint mine?
- Yeah.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.233
- Me too.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.438
- I hear the two of you were
on fire at the Faith Conference.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.441
- It was okay.
- Oh, it was more than okay.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.410
I think the audience
really responded.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.148
- Well, that's good to hear.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.217
We need to get our message
out there.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.287
How lovely.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.256
- Summer painted it.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.327
- She's very talented.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.595
Yeah.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.464
Mm.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.432
Fresh pine.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.904
It's too bad we burn them.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.876
*

13:28.909 --> 13:30.343
No one owns you.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.045
You own you.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.581
- I know.
- I know.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.917
- Are you allowed to talk
to people on the outside?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.385
- Yeah, of course.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.353
We talk to people
on the outside all the time.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.055
- So they wouldn't have
a problem

13:42.089 --> 13:44.557
that your mom is in town
visiting?

13:44.591 --> 13:47.227
- A lot of Meyerists choose
to cut off

13:47.260 --> 13:48.328
from their families, okay?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.030
I have not chosen to do that.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.100
- So why are you so worried?
- I'm not.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.902
You keep looking out the window.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.412
- Yeah, 'cause
we're talking about me leaving.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.071
- Are you not allowed to leave?

13:58.105 --> 14:00.207
- I can do whatever I want.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.574
- Is that so?

14:01.608 --> 14:04.011
- Yeah, I'm concerned
about Mary, okay?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.621
She doesn't know
I'm talking about all this.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.281
Your dad and I want
both of you to come home.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.183
We'll help in every way we can

14:10.217 --> 14:11.885
to take care of
Mary and our grandchild.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.021
- Yes, but this is about you,
Sean.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.555
What you want.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.491
You can't make
another person do something.

14:18.525 --> 14:22.595
Same way that the Meyerists
can't make you stay.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.432
No one has that power
over another human being.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.067
- Can you find a way to get Mary

14:27.100 --> 14:29.036
to sit down with Wendy
this afternoon?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.271
- No, we have to be
at the compound by sundown.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.207
- Why? What will happen
if you're not there by sundown?

14:40.013 --> 14:43.250
*

14:43.283 --> 14:45.618
So then when
he's about to take the poison

14:45.652 --> 14:47.955
that transforms him
into a beast,

14:47.988 --> 14:49.622
she breaks up with him.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.458
- Why?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.226
- So he doesn't have to
live as a beast.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.963
She knows that
being a beast sucks

14:55.996 --> 14:58.298
and he'd probably be happier

14:58.331 --> 15:01.234
living in the world he was
born into, in the human world.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.170
- That's sad.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.272
- Well, yeah, the assignment
was to write a tragedy.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.144
- It's kind of like
the story of us.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.647
Except you're not a beast.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.950
- You kinda saw me as one.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.385
- And you didn't
break up with me

15:18.418 --> 15:22.655
to save me from
the wild world of beastdom.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.125
- No.
- Why did you?

15:25.158 --> 15:31.131
*

15:31.164 --> 15:34.001
- I don't know.
- Things were really hard.

15:34.034 --> 15:38.405
*

15:38.438 --> 15:41.408
God, this view is incredible.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.477
*

15:44.511 --> 15:46.679
Restitution!

15:46.713 --> 15:50.550
Um, I... God, this always happens
when I'm with you.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.320
- What?
- I lose track of time.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.588
I'm supposed to be
at the compound by sundown.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.200
- I-I have to go.
- I mean, you're not gonna

15:57.224 --> 16:00.027
make it now.
Wait, am I gonna see you again?

16:00.060 --> 16:07.034
*

16:07.067 --> 16:09.502
You know what?

16:11.238 --> 16:14.507
I just watched my mom on stage

16:14.541 --> 16:16.743
at the World Faith Conference

16:16.776 --> 16:19.246
say all these things

16:19.279 --> 16:22.515
about self-love, and...

16:22.549 --> 16:25.485
they had nothing to do
with Meyerism.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.288
- Okay...

16:28.321 --> 16:31.024
I don't know what that means.

16:31.058 --> 16:37.997
*

16:39.499 --> 16:41.301
Wait, are you sure?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.636
- Yeah.

16:43.670 --> 16:50.610
*

16:56.283 --> 16:59.686
The most important
three days of our calendar year.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.454
We reflect,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.256
we re-act,

17:03.290 --> 17:06.259
and we relinquish.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.396
Cleansing our spirits
and our consciences

17:09.429 --> 17:12.632
for the contemplative months
of fall and winter ahead.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.701
- As we go into
the dark of night,

17:14.733 --> 17:17.637
we meditate
on our Transgressions.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.111
We locate
our transgressive actions

17:24.144 --> 17:28.348
for the past year that haunt us.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.184
We locate those we have hurt.

17:31.218 --> 17:35.088
We leave these vessels,
our bodies,

17:35.122 --> 17:39.426
and take the vessel
of the one we have caused pain.

17:39.459 --> 17:43.596
We live in the pain
that we have inflicted.

17:43.630 --> 17:47.134
We suffer as the sufferer does.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.137
*

17:50.170 --> 17:52.639
- My family.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.375
- Yes.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.311
- With my doubt.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.180
- Yes.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.583
*

18:03.616 --> 18:05.152
Take that on.

18:05.185 --> 18:12.125
* *

18:21.768 --> 18:28.708
*

18:38.718 --> 18:45.658
*

18:54.501 --> 19:01.441
*

19:02.509 --> 19:04.477
- Rest.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.180
Tomorrow we act.

19:07.214 --> 19:12.151
*

19:19.726 --> 19:26.666
*

19:39.279 --> 19:42.315
* *

19:42.349 --> 19:45.252
- Mrs. Small, I'm sorry
to barge in on you like this.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.619
- It's all right.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.588
- I tried to reach Marshall
on the phone.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.623
There was a service message.
It was disconnected.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.892
- He passed.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.328
Two weeks ago.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.764
Felt like he was sick forever,

19:57.797 --> 20:00.667
but then, when it came...

20:00.700 --> 20:03.770
*

20:03.803 --> 20:06.506
It came so quick.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.775
* *

20:08.808 --> 20:13.546
* Amazing grace

20:13.580 --> 20:17.817
* How sweet the sound

20:17.850 --> 20:22.355
* That saved a wretch

20:22.389 --> 20:26.793
* Like me

20:26.826 --> 20:30.263
* I once was lost

20:30.297 --> 20:32.265
- Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Roberts.

20:32.299 --> 20:35.602
* But now am found

20:35.635 --> 20:36.969
* Was blind

20:37.003 --> 20:39.772
- First, please allow me
to express

20:39.806 --> 20:43.643
my deepest condolences
for the loss of your mother.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.346
Unfortunately,
the state requires us

20:46.379 --> 20:48.648
to fill out certain forms.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.550
I'll need your signature
in those places

20:50.583 --> 20:53.019
and I'll need to see
a form of ID.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.554
Driver's license is fine.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.723
It's purely a formality.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.425
Thank you, sir.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.960
* *

21:00.993 --> 21:03.596
* Was grace

21:03.630 --> 21:06.566
* That taught

21:06.599 --> 21:10.036
* My heart to fear

21:10.069 --> 21:12.472
* Grace

21:12.505 --> 21:16.443
* My fears relieved

21:16.476 --> 21:19.312
*

21:19.346 --> 21:21.748
* How precious

21:21.781 --> 21:25.318
* Did that grace

21:25.352 --> 21:27.854
* Grace appear

21:27.887 --> 21:30.022
* The hour

21:30.056 --> 21:34.427
* I first believed

21:34.461 --> 21:41.401
*

21:58.785 --> 22:01.454
- Daddy!

22:01.488 --> 22:03.590
- Hey, kiddo!

22:03.623 --> 22:06.359
Oh!
Oh, wow, you're so big.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.027
- I lost two molars.
- What?

22:08.060 --> 22:10.630
- I swallowed one of them.
- Let me see.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.633
Oh, wow, that is disgusting.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.736
- I hope you didn't look for it.
- I didn't.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.142
Hey.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.811
Want to talk to you, Summer.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.582
Just wanna say that I'm sorry.

22:29.616 --> 22:33.453
For not being there
every morning, every night,

22:33.486 --> 22:36.456
every tooth.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.991
I want you know that
I think about you all the time.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.594
- What do you think about?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.396
- How much I miss you.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.432
How much I love you.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.699
- Fiercely and forever?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.002
Fiercely and forever.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.139
Mm.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.542
- When are we gonna be
a family again?

22:57.744 --> 22:59.512
- I don't know.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.017
I don't know.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.153
How's your roommate?

23:07.186 --> 23:09.656
She's not gonna walk in on us,
is she?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.491
No, she's never here.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.792
Parents have some big apartment

23:12.825 --> 23:14.661
and she always goes
to the Hamptons.

23:17.129 --> 23:22.702
- Why does she have
all those... dolls?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.872
- Um, she's a puppetry major.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.008
Everybody here is so rich.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.077
God, this city.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.713
- Not the part I see.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.583
- Yeah, but you're, like,
a saint, right?

23:36.616 --> 23:39.852
- We just see
so much need everywhere.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.889
In my 2R work, just the lack
of access to just basic...

23:42.922 --> 23:45.592
- Wait, 2R?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.794
- Yeah, I'm...

23:47.827 --> 23:49.529
climbing the second rung.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.864
Cal's my guide.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.165
- Oh.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.969
You know,
you kinda look like him now.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.237
Is that part of it?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.839
Was it your initiation
or something?

23:59.872 --> 24:02.208
- No.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.212
I just... I was ready
for a change.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.014
Do you miss it?

24:08.047 --> 24:10.617
- Your hair?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.086
No.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.523
I like it.
I can see you better.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.204
How mad do you think
your mom would be right now...

24:32.238 --> 24:34.140
- I-I don't...

24:34.173 --> 24:36.242
Sorry, I don't wanna talk
about my mom right now.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.210
- Sorry.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.812
- It's just she's not...

24:39.846 --> 24:42.815
in charge of me anymore.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.984
- Yeah, but Cal is.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.057
* *

24:51.090 --> 24:53.593
We should go explore the city
together or something.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.694
Yeah.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.897
* La-la-la-la *

24:57.930 --> 25:00.867
* La-la-la-la-la-la

25:00.900 --> 25:02.268
* La-la-la-la-la

25:03.836 --> 25:05.605
* La-la-la

25:05.638 --> 25:08.140
*

25:08.174 --> 25:12.144
* You're my heart

25:12.178 --> 25:15.615
* Baby, spread your wings
and fly *

25:15.648 --> 25:19.151
* You're my heart

25:19.185 --> 25:20.953
* I'll be right here

25:20.987 --> 25:23.089
- Oh.
- Hawk is sick.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.124
- Stomach virus.
- Oh, no.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.893
- He must be devastated.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.028
This will be the first
break fast without him.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.963
- And without Steve.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.866
- And without Daddy.

25:33.900 --> 25:38.738
*

25:38.771 --> 25:42.041
- Honey, I know how hard it is
when things change.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.144
Hey.
What's going on?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.213
- Can I got to my room?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.315
- But you love break fast.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.751
Are you not feeling well?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.120
Dad.
Was she all right today?

25:54.153 --> 25:57.356
- Yeah, we had a fun time
at the park, right, kiddo?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.758
We played a lot at the park.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.793
Maybe she's tired.
Are you tired?

26:00.827 --> 26:02.328
- What else can I help with?

26:02.361 --> 26:05.164
- Bring in the rest of the salad
and we should be ready.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.600
- Everything okay?

26:07.634 --> 26:08.801
- Hawk's sick.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.637
- Oh, no.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.104
I'll call over to the center,

26:12.138 --> 26:14.106
get someone to look in on him.

26:14.140 --> 26:18.244
*

26:18.277 --> 26:21.981
- I'll wait
until you're ready to tell me.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.051
- Honey, you wanna help me
light the candles?

26:25.084 --> 26:29.121
*

26:29.155 --> 26:32.058
- You and Cal aren't...

26:32.091 --> 26:35.161
* La-la-la-la-la

26:35.194 --> 26:37.864
* La-la-la-la-la

26:37.897 --> 26:40.867
* La-la-la

26:40.900 --> 26:43.736
*

26:47.239 --> 26:49.241
What's going on, Mom?

26:49.275 --> 26:50.342
- What?

26:50.376 --> 26:53.713
- You seem... weird.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.047
Doesn't she seem weird, Dad?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.282
- Are you weird, babe?

26:56.315 --> 26:58.951
- No.
- Just hungry.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.119
Low blood sugar.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.420
Dinner's on the table.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.924
- Dinner.
- Come on, kids, time to eat.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.059
- Is that knocking?

27:07.093 --> 27:08.333
Joy, do you mind grabbing that?

27:08.360 --> 27:09.996
- Hello?

27:11.864 --> 27:12.965
I...

27:15.334 --> 27:17.069
Who is it?

27:18.437 --> 27:20.707
- Hello, Sarah.
- What are you doing here, Tess?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.408
- Restitution, right, Dad?

27:22.441 --> 27:26.212
Thought I'd stop by and remind
you all that I still exist.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.017
Well, isn't anyone
gonna say hello?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.885
* *

27:32.919 --> 27:33.986
- Hello, Tessa.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.788
- Hello, Cal.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.823
- Who is she?

27:36.856 --> 27:38.157
- Tessa.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.960
- Wow, Russel.
- You know my name.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.361
You got old.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.831
- It's really not a good time,
Tessa.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.299
Why don't we do this
when the kids aren't around?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.702
- Your ex said
you'd have my back.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.103
- Eddie?

27:51.137 --> 27:53.773
- Yeah, we were having coffee
the other day.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.775
Why did you get
in touch with Eddie?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.043
He got in touch with me.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.277
- You know my dad?

27:58.310 --> 27:59.879
Hey, come on upstairs, Summer.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.281
Let's... let's all go upstairs.
Come one.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.483
*

28:04.516 --> 28:06.753
- What did Eddie want with you?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.755
- I don't know.
- Guess he's sad and mad

28:08.788 --> 28:09.965
'cause he's not used to
how fucked up

28:09.989 --> 28:11.257
this whole situation is.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.959
- Why don't we step outside,
Tessa?

28:12.992 --> 28:15.127
- I'm sorry, Cal.
- Are you part of this family now?

28:15.161 --> 28:16.504
Because I'm trying
to talk to my family.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.230
- Hello, Mom.
- Hey, let me walk you...

28:18.264 --> 28:19.975
- Leave me alone.
- You're worse than all of them.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.500
Mom, please, look at me.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.069
Look at me, Mom.
Look at me.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.304
- I need you to go.
- Now.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.040
Please.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.742
We can talk later privately.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.844
And I would like that very much,
to talk to you,

28:31.878 --> 28:33.379
but this is not the way
to do it.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.281
- Do they know
you were gonna come with me?

28:35.314 --> 28:38.217
Did they? Did you guys all know
your great Guardian of the Light

28:38.250 --> 28:41.387
had her fucking bags packed?
Did you?

28:41.420 --> 28:44.991
I waited for you in
Grand Central for three hours,

28:45.024 --> 28:46.358
but you didn't come.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.194
- I was a kid.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.230
- Do you know the things
I had to do to get by?

28:51.263 --> 28:52.865
- Look at me, do you?
- I was a kid.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.334
- But I did them.
- I did them, and I got out.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.003
And I have a great life now.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.437
I have a great life.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.907
Do you hear me?
I have a great life.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.809
*

29:02.842 --> 29:07.113
Your ex said if we forced you
to see us, you would.

29:07.146 --> 29:11.117
He was wrong.
He was wrong.

29:11.150 --> 29:18.090
*

29:26.098 --> 29:33.039
*

29:41.247 --> 29:43.415
I wonder what
my parents would do

29:43.449 --> 29:46.118
if I walked into their house.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.330
- You okay, Mom?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.268
- Gab...
- No.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.039
How long?

30:07.073 --> 30:09.308
- How long what?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.010
- 15 years.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.382
- I...

30:19.418 --> 30:21.187
I need to be alone.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.856
- What? What's going on?
- What's 15 years?

30:26.525 --> 30:28.260
Dad, what's 15 years?

30:28.294 --> 30:29.929
- God, Russel.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.899
He's been seeing your sister
for 15 years.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.502
- She's my daughter.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.905
- Let's get the kids.
- Go home.

30:38.938 --> 30:42.374
- You'd do the same
if one of yours took off.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.911
- Maybe.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.879
But I wouldn't lie about it.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.151
Come on, let's go!

30:52.184 --> 30:53.285
I don't wanna go!

30:53.319 --> 30:54.453
Well, too bad.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.088
Get in the car!

30:59.125 --> 31:01.527
*

31:01.560 --> 31:03.529
- I love you.

31:03.562 --> 31:09.435
*

31:09.468 --> 31:12.438
- You had your bags packed?

31:12.471 --> 31:14.573
- I was a kid.

31:14.606 --> 31:18.310
And I wanted to be free.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.646
We would stay up all night

31:20.679 --> 31:24.383
planning our escape.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.519
But I couldn't do it.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.389
And then as I got older,

31:30.422 --> 31:33.225
I was grateful I stayed.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.428
I started to believe
that The Light saved me

31:36.462 --> 31:39.431
from walking out of my life.

31:39.465 --> 31:43.335
I just don't understand
why Eddie would do this.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.204
- He's angry.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.074
He's acting viciously.

31:48.107 --> 31:51.210
He was probably hoping
Hawk would be here

31:51.243 --> 31:53.412
and Hawk would find out
that you tried to leave

31:53.445 --> 31:55.414
the same age that he was
when he tried to leave.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.049
- You know, I deserve

31:57.083 --> 31:58.517
what just happened in there.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.086
- No...
- No, I deserve it.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.088
- No, no, you don't, Sarah.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.724
- Marshall Small died.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.060
- From Clarksville?

32:08.094 --> 32:09.261
I'm so sorry to hear that.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.430
- And there's nothing.

32:11.463 --> 32:16.035
There's no action that
I can take to make things right.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.336
- Mm.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.674
You will find a way

32:22.708 --> 32:25.544
to do something for Marshal,
you will.

32:25.577 --> 32:31.117
But as long as you hold on
to guilt about Eddie,

32:31.150 --> 32:34.286
you'll never be free
to live the life,

32:34.320 --> 32:38.457
to have the love
that you deserve.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.200
- I need to put Summer to bed.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.509
- Relinquish it tomorrow, Sarah.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.114
I-I don't want to be your sin.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.587
* Last night I tried
to find my demon *

33:08.620 --> 33:12.458
* He was gone

33:12.491 --> 33:16.295
* My hand stretched out
to hold him *

33:16.328 --> 33:20.699
* And he slipped
right through my fingers *

33:20.732 --> 33:24.503
* Never in my life

33:24.536 --> 33:26.438
*

33:26.472 --> 33:30.442
- I've been living a double life
for too long.

33:30.476 --> 33:33.212
It's exhausting.

33:33.245 --> 33:36.215
You start to lose sight
of everything.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.117
Who you are, what you want.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.394
And now that
they're blackmailing me,

33:39.418 --> 33:41.487
making it worse,

33:41.520 --> 33:43.589
I think this is the moment

33:43.622 --> 33:45.291
that you blow it up,
and come clean.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.493
- We'd lose everything.
- Everyone.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.228
- Not necessarily.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.564
You know, maybe we can
get the Feds to cut us a deal,

33:52.598 --> 33:54.566
help us keep it quiet.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.735
- I don't know.

33:56.768 --> 34:02.641
*

34:02.674 --> 34:05.444
- Well, you have to decide
for yourself.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.346
But me,

34:07.379 --> 34:11.117
I'm not about to start letting
these people control me,

34:11.150 --> 34:13.351
judge me,
tell me how to live my life.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.286
I'm putting a stop
to these motherfuckers

34:15.321 --> 34:19.558
who promised me I could unburden
without any repercussions.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.261
*

34:25.297 --> 34:29.735
*

34:37.243 --> 34:38.610
- Hey, you know the woman

34:38.643 --> 34:40.411
who gave you
"The Wizard of Oz" book?

34:40.446 --> 34:44.350
She wasn't a friend
of my mom's from college.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.717
- Who was she?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.388
- She's a counselor.

34:49.420 --> 34:54.760
My parents, they hired her
to get me back home.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.531
- And you knew who she was

34:59.565 --> 35:02.501
when you asked me
to go to the baby shower?

35:04.236 --> 35:06.872
You lied to me.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.874
Why?

35:08.907 --> 35:11.710
- Because I'm thinking
of going home.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.346
And I want you to come with me.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.216
Look, just talk to Wendy
one more time, okay?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.185
She can help you see.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.854
We can have a life
somewhere else,

35:22.888 --> 35:24.890
a life we make together.

35:24.923 --> 35:29.261
- And if I don't wanna go,
will you go without me?

35:29.295 --> 35:33.432
- The only thing
that's keeping me here is you.

35:33.465 --> 35:40.406
*

35:46.912 --> 35:51.550
You asked
why I broke up with you?

35:51.583 --> 35:54.720
- I know things were difficult
with your family

35:54.753 --> 35:56.722
and everything.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.595
- Yeah,
but it was more than that.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.238
Cal offered us a house
if I broke up with you.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.442
- What?

36:16.475 --> 36:17.943
- My family needed it.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.211
And I...

36:19.245 --> 36:22.248
I couldn't...

36:22.281 --> 36:24.483
I wish I had the strength
to say no to him, but...

36:24.516 --> 36:25.627
- That doesn't make any sense.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.286
Why would Cal do that?

36:27.319 --> 36:28.854
- Because he didn't want
to lose you.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.523
He and your mom.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.792
He's not the amazing man
that you think he is.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.665
You dad, he would have
never that to you, Hawk.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.498
- You don't know a fucking thing
about my dad

36:39.531 --> 36:42.301
or Cal or any of it.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.236
- I have hated myself
for what I did to you.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.672
- And I'm telling you now...
- You should have told me then.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.807
- Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.545
- This is... this is...
- Look, I really, really

36:53.579 --> 36:54.889
wanted to tell you,
but I didn't know how.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.382
- Great.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.691
Hawk.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.893
Hawk!

37:07.926 --> 37:14.866
*

37:17.703 --> 37:21.373
* Stranded by this

37:21.407 --> 37:24.610
* Open window

37:24.643 --> 37:25.777
* All my debts unfold

37:28.880 --> 37:30.516
- Sarah.
- Why?

37:30.549 --> 37:33.419
Are you trying to hurt me?
My family?

37:33.452 --> 37:34.653
- Sarah.
- Tessa.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.855
She comes over to the house.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.657
Summer is there,
and she's shouting at me.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.626
She's shouting at my mother.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.003
- I didn't know
she was gonna do that.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.462
- Why are you even
talking to her?

37:43.495 --> 37:45.297
- Look, I can talk to people,
Sarah.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.466
I can reach out.
This is my experience too.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.000
I'm just trying
to figure things out.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.802
- No, no.
- But you made it about us.

37:50.836 --> 37:54.840
You made it about hurting
my mother, my dad, my brother.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.976
- That, I apologize...
- No, and you hurt me.

37:58.009 --> 38:01.313
Will you let me go, please?

38:01.347 --> 38:03.415
You have to let me go.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.584
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.353
*

38:07.386 --> 38:10.021
* As I let them go

38:10.055 --> 38:11.022
* Water cries from my soul

38:11.056 --> 38:12.391
- Sarah.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.460
*

38:14.493 --> 38:17.963
* Stripping me down
to the bone *

38:17.996 --> 38:20.732
* *

38:20.766 --> 38:24.035
* Stripping me down
to the bone *

38:24.069 --> 38:26.805
*

38:26.838 --> 38:30.742
* Stripping me down
to the bone *

38:39.885 --> 38:41.487
*

38:41.520 --> 38:43.955
I am not a leader.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.957
- Eddie.
- No, I fucked up.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.626
Okay?
I hurt people.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.729
- You can't mend
a 20-year practice on a whim.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.130
- It wasn't a whim, Felicia.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.567
- Faith requires sacrifice.
- Steve knew that.

38:55.601 --> 38:58.136
He knew we must let go of those
who didn't stand with us.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.372
Otherwise the temptation
was too great.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.908
- Well, I can't be a part
of that, all right?

39:02.941 --> 39:05.110
- I won't.
- Maybe it could be changed.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.012
But it has to be done carefully,

39:07.045 --> 39:09.080
once you're ensconced
as The Guardian

39:09.114 --> 39:10.616
and the people feel safe.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.751
- Look, I am not cut out
for this, Richard.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.962
I don't want the responsibility
of other people's lives.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.424
I can barely deal with my own,
okay?

39:18.457 --> 39:20.025
I don't want to bring
any more pain.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.793
- But you have to replace her.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.630
Sarah is not
the rightful Guardian.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.765
- I won't do that.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.701
I can't.

39:29.735 --> 39:33.905
* *

39:33.939 --> 39:36.408
- We can't lose him!

39:36.442 --> 39:38.677
- It's not for us to choose.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.512
It's for The Light.

39:40.546 --> 39:45.016
If he's meant to be the one,
then he will be it.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.422
*

39:50.456 --> 39:52.624
- * For all those who aspire

39:52.658 --> 39:54.660
* To climb up even higher

39:54.693 --> 39:57.563
* From the muck of desire

39:57.596 --> 39:59.965
* Look to the Eye of Meyer

39:59.998 --> 40:02.200
* For those
that don't break even *

40:02.233 --> 40:04.670
* When they heard the word
of Steven *

40:04.703 --> 40:07.606
* From the saints
down to the heathens *

40:07.639 --> 40:09.508
* With every breath
he's breathing *

40:09.541 --> 40:12.478
* To take shelter
from the wrath *

40:12.511 --> 40:14.613
* For unto you he hath

40:14.646 --> 40:16.982
* Already done the math

40:17.015 --> 40:19.618
* And put you on the path

40:19.651 --> 40:21.820
* There's a serpent
and an adder *

40:21.853 --> 40:24.022
* There's a wind that fails
to scatter *

40:24.055 --> 40:26.792
* All the things
that make up matter *

40:26.825 --> 40:29.194
* It's high up on the ladder

40:29.227 --> 40:31.897
* And he reaches up a hand

40:31.930 --> 40:34.065
* Each rung reveals a plan

40:34.099 --> 40:36.602
* To the only one who can

40:36.635 --> 40:38.837
* Seal up the fate of man

40:38.870 --> 40:41.640
* And his hands
they don't burn *

40:41.673 --> 40:44.009
* As he climbs
from stem from stern *

40:44.042 --> 40:46.612
* And the truth
for which we earn *

40:46.645 --> 40:48.980
* He'll come back to return

40:49.014 --> 40:51.550
* So take shelter
'neath the lath *

40:51.583 --> 40:53.785
* For unto you he hath

40:53.819 --> 40:56.555
* Already done the math

40:56.588 --> 40:59.558
* And you put on the path

40:59.591 --> 41:06.532
*

41:26.652 --> 41:29.120
On the final day of Restitution,

41:29.154 --> 41:31.089
we relinquish.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.192
We relinquish.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.762
We cleanse our Transgress

41:36.795 --> 41:40.599
so we can burn the sins
of last year.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.035
So we can go into the fall

41:44.069 --> 41:47.739
free of our ill actions.

41:50.776 --> 41:57.716
*

42:18.003 --> 42:19.671
Hey.

42:19.705 --> 42:20.806
You leaving?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.974
- Oh, I'll be back soon.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.743
I, uh...

42:24.776 --> 42:27.746
I need more than this
for my restitution.

42:27.779 --> 42:34.052
*

42:35.186 --> 42:36.955
- I'll talk to her.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.290
The counselor.

42:39.324 --> 42:44.630
*

42:44.663 --> 42:46.164
- Hey.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.332
How you feeling?

42:47.365 --> 42:48.900
Better?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.738
- I wasn't sick.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.873
- What's going on?

42:54.906 --> 42:57.075
- I willingly missed
Restitution.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.113
I need to cleanse.

43:02.147 --> 43:07.819
*

43:07.853 --> 43:10.822
Let's blow it up.

43:10.856 --> 43:13.158
End this charade.

43:13.191 --> 43:20.131
*

43:31.309 --> 43:33.912
- I want to see her.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.114
Our daughter.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.416
I want to see her.

43:38.449 --> 43:45.390
*

44:17.789 --> 44:24.730
*

44:53.391 --> 45:00.331
*

45:11.409 --> 45:17.949
*

45:19.918 --> 45:26.524
* You stay dumb,
won't you save it on my heart *

45:26.557 --> 45:30.996
* You say that I'm negative

45:31.029 --> 45:35.867
* But you know
it's all made up *

45:35.901 --> 45:41.773
* You know that
a song is a sign *

45:41.807 --> 45:45.543
* Let it be soft

45:45.576 --> 45:50.481
* Thank God that I find

45:50.515 --> 45:54.452
* To think at all

45:54.485 --> 45:58.223
* You know that I

45:58.256 --> 46:02.193
* I lie

46:02.227 --> 46:04.195
- Forgive me.

46:04.229 --> 46:07.165
* You know that I

46:07.198 --> 46:11.803
* I lie

46:11.837 --> 46:16.407
* With high girls in motion

46:16.441 --> 46:18.276
* They're light

46:18.309 --> 46:21.813
* And they're bright

46:21.847 --> 46:25.416
"I relinquish my guilt
for being with Cal.

46:25.450 --> 46:28.987
"Everything else I've done
that is horrible this year,

46:29.020 --> 46:31.589
I'll hold onto."

46:31.622 --> 46:37.929
* Eager in my den

46:40.265 --> 46:47.205
*
