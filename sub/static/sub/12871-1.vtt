TOM: I grew up
slowly beside the
tides and marshes

00:49.983 --> 00:52.052
of a Carolina sea island.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.027
We lived
in a small white house,

01:00.094 --> 01:03.030
won by my
great, great grandfather,

01:03.097 --> 01:05.633
Winston Shadrach Wingo,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.569
in a horseshoe game.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.475
LUKE: Last one around
the tree is a ninny!

01:14.542 --> 01:16.410
(LAUGHING)
Joop, Joop, Joop,
come here!

01:16.477 --> 01:18.412
LILA: Boys, boys!
Careful, now!

01:18.479 --> 01:20.814
I'll race you, Tom!
YOUNG TOM: Wait up, Luke!

01:20.881 --> 01:23.317
There are families
who live out
their entire lives

01:23.384 --> 01:25.719
without a single
thing of interest
happening to them.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.688
YOUNG SAVANNAH:
Don't run so fast, Tom!

01:27.755 --> 01:29.557
I've always envied
those families.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.892
LILA: Luke, mind you
don't torment that dog!

01:31.959 --> 01:33.727
It's my dog.
It's my dog!

01:33.794 --> 01:36.497
Tom, you're gonna
step on him!
He's only a pup.

01:36.564 --> 01:39.533
YOUNG SAVANNAH: Here, Joop!
Come here, Joop!
Mom, did you see me run?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.936
Savannah,
you want a bean?
Come here, Joop!

01:43.003 --> 01:45.139
Boys, you want
a bean?
Give one to the dog.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.741
(SQUEALING)
Quit squealing,
Savannah.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.478
You're next, Tom.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.513
The child
of a beautiful woman,

01:52.580 --> 01:56.384
I was also a shrimper's son
in love with the shape
of boats.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.257
Luke, he's pushing me.
I'm not pushing her.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.958
Quit pushing her.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.463
Just like that.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.633
As a small boy,
I loved to navigate
my father's shrimp boat

02:12.700 --> 02:14.268
between the sandbars.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.404
Rocks coming ahead.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.508
I suppose
Henry Wingo would have
made a pretty good father

02:20.574 --> 02:23.110
if he hadn't been
such a violent man.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.719
From my mother I inherited
a love of language

02:31.785 --> 02:33.987
and an appreciation
of nature.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.893
She could turn
a walk around the island

02:39.960 --> 02:42.496
into a voyage
of purest discovery.

02:45.899 --> 02:50.103
As a child,
I thought she was the most
extraordinary woman on Earth.

02:51.805 --> 02:55.108
I wasn't
the first son to be
wrong about his mother.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.890
HENRY: I am sick
and tired of you

03:09.957 --> 03:12.360
LILA: Leave me alone!
never showing me any
respect in my own house!

03:12.426 --> 03:14.628
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

03:14.695 --> 03:18.599
TOM: I don't know when
my parents began their war
against each other.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.934
YOUNG TOM: You're running
too fast for me!
LUKE: Move it, Tom!

03:21.001 --> 03:23.504
But I do know
the only prisoners
they took

03:23.571 --> 03:25.639
were their children.
Wait, you guys!

03:25.706 --> 03:28.476
My shoes
are falling off!
Keep up, Savannah.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.044
When my brother, sister
and I needed to escape,

03:31.111 --> 03:33.747
we developed a ritual.
Okay, jump!

03:35.616 --> 03:37.685
We found a silent,
soothing world

03:37.751 --> 03:39.720
where there was no pain.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.824
A world without
mothers or fathers.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.330
We would make a circle
bound by flesh

03:49.397 --> 03:51.399
and blood and water.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.503
And only when we felt
our lungs betray us

03:55.569 --> 03:59.807
would we rise
toward the light.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.444
And the fear of what
lay in wait for us
above the surface.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.382
(ALL CHATTERING)

04:16.589 --> 04:19.360
All this was
a long time ago,

04:19.427 --> 04:22.330
before I chose
not to have a memory.

04:22.396 --> 04:27.167
Daddy!
I think something bit me!

04:27.234 --> 04:30.571
TOM: Mr. Brighton,
are you selling dope
to my girls again?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.506
Stop bugging us, Dad.
Bye, girls.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.543
Bye, Mr. Brighton.
TOM: Come on in!
It's getting late.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.578
It's a conch.
TOM: Bring him home.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.313
I'll send him
to college.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.881
How do you know
it's a boy?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.816
Well, let's examine him.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.619
Now, girls,
have I ever told you
the facts of life?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.988
Oh, no.
Not this again.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.324
Stay away from boys,
because they're all
Mom!

04:50.391 --> 04:52.793
disgusting,
self-indulgent beasts
Hi, honey.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.195
that pee on bushes
and pick their noses.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.798
Gross, Dad.
That's completely gross.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.267
Oh.
Anyway, I'm not gonna
stay away from boys.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.070
That's the spirit, Lucy.
Never do a thing
your parents tell you.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.205
Hey, Mom,
look what I found.

05:05.272 --> 05:08.642
Daddy, if you
don't quit smoking,
you're gonna die.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.544
That's what they
told me at school.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.247
Well, no more
school for you.
Mom, Dad's smoking again.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.584
Oh, no. Well, you know
what to do with that.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.887
Put it in the sink.
Give me a kiss.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.222
I want to play!

05:22.289 --> 05:24.224
You look tired, Doctor.
I'll fix you a drink.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.460
Oh, that would be
so nice.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.396
It's been
one of those days.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.432
Hey, honey,
it's tough work
being a saint.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.066
(PHONE RINGING)

05:33.133 --> 05:35.803
Sal, can you get it?
Something smells good.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.839
LUCY: Hey, Dad,
come play with us!
Later.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.774
SALLY: It's your mother.
She's calling from her car.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.576
I'm not here.
Okay, Lila.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.478
She's coming over.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.114
Why didn't you tell her
we were under quarantine?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.483
She said
she had to see you.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.618
CHANDLER: Dad,
they won't share.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.820
Work it out, girls.
Work it out.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.088
She said it was urgent.
She was crying.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.125
I can't remember a day
when Lila wasn't crying.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.193
Be nice to her, Tom.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.563
I hate my mother, Sally.
I enjoy hating her.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.932
Please don't kill
one of the few pleasures
in my life.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.300
Then can we talk
about something else?
Sure. What?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.804
Us.
I need a stiff drink
for that conversation.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.774
Girls? Girls!

06:13.841 --> 06:16.510
What?
Would anyone like
to sit on Daddy's lap?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.646
GIRLS: No!
There's money involved.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.448
GIRLS: Yes!

06:20.514 --> 06:22.583
Now, girls,
I'm gonna ask you
a serious question,

06:22.650 --> 06:24.485
and I want you to answer it
with brutal honesty.
Oh, brother.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.786
I already know
what the question is.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.456
Who's the greatest
human being on this Earth?
Mama!

06:28.522 --> 06:31.324
Mama? I've got
to develop some
new routines, huh?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.093
Come on, everybody,
pick up now.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.195
Come on, wash.
It's bath time.
Gotta get ready.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.931
Yeah, we got to pass
inspection, troops.
Lila's coming over.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.834
Lila, Lila, Lila.
Why can't we
call her Grandma?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.870
You'll know when
you're a grandma.
I will?

06:42.936 --> 06:45.238
Now come on.
Pick up everything
and get into that tub.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.074
How's a little
bouillabaisse sound
to you, Mrs. Wingo?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.643
CHANDLER: Yuck! Can't we
ever have normal food?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.179
Do you think we
could talk seriously
for just a few minutes?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.014
Not now, Sally.
My mother's getting close.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.216
Can't you tell?
The air has stopped moving.

06:56.283 --> 07:00.454
(GROANS) Sometimes I think
all you need is just a good
smack across your mouth.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.189
Uh-oh. Here she is.
Oh, Sally, quick.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.657
Tie this garlic
around my neck.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.659
Do we have to invite her
for dinner?

07:05.726 --> 07:09.129
She won't stay.
You know that.
Then let's invite her.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.666
Lila.
Hello, Sally, dear.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.504
Those shrubs need watering.

07:16.570 --> 07:20.207
Oh, yeah.
I'll have to do that.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.776
You're looking
well, Lila.
Don't be glib, Tom.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.011
Will you be having
dinner with us?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.214
No, I can't stay long.
What a shame.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.717
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
Where are the children?

07:29.783 --> 07:33.386
They're taking baths. Why?
I have some bad news.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.023
Don't tell me
they cancelled your
American Express card?

07:36.089 --> 07:39.326
Your sister tried
to kill herself again.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.829
You want to make
another joke?

07:41.895 --> 07:44.297
Oh, my God, Lila. When?

07:44.364 --> 07:46.366
I'm not sure.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.036
She was in a coma
when they found her.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.374
How is she now?

07:54.441 --> 07:57.077
She's alive, thank God.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.746
I spoke
to her psychiatrist.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.615
Some Jewish woman
in New York.

08:01.682 --> 08:05.018
She wants one of us
to go up there right away.
I told her you'd go.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.021
What are you saying, Lila?
If she's a shrink
and a Jew, you can't go?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.723
I didn't say that.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.026
I'm just
not entirely sure
I'd be welcome.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.496
You know Savannah.
She'll probably blame me.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.031
My children blame me
for everything.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.067
Oh, do I detect a note
of guilt there, Mama?

08:20.133 --> 08:23.103
Don't you give me that
psychological horseshit.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.738
Why don't you just come
right out and say it?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.507
I'm responsible
for all your problems.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.476
Including your
being out of a job.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.645
Let's hit way below
the belt, now, Lila.
Come on. It's fun.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.413
Don't pretend
you didn't start this.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.148
Fact is I just can't
go right now.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.217
It's your stepfather's
birthday this weekend.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.019
Well, gee, Mother,
I can't go either

08:39.086 --> 08:41.020
because I gotta wash out
Sally's pantyhose.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.556
I'm gonna take
the clothes to
the cleaner.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.392
Why don't you get a job
as a stand-up comedian?

08:45.458 --> 08:46.894
I'm sure it pays better
than teaching did.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.029
Which was far
beneath me anyway.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.731
Now wasn't that what
you were gonna say?
Beneath your abilities, yes.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.332
What do you know
about my abilities?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.034
Talking to you is like
chewing on tinfoil.
What do you mean?

08:54.101 --> 08:57.204
It always has been.
Stop it now,
the both of you!

09:23.864 --> 09:25.833
I'm sorry
you're hurting.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.169
You wanted to talk?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.339
It can wait.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.774
Let's walk.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.585

you're thinking.

(SIGHS)

09:47.955 --> 09:52.059
I'm trying to calculate
the exact moment
everything got so fucked up.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.663
Uh, I'm also
worried the Braves
are gonna finish last.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.564
I don't feel
like laughing.

09:57.631 --> 10:01.301
Oh, come on, Sally.
Come on.

10:01.368 --> 10:05.538
Do you know that this is
the first time that you have
touched me in weeks?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.376
(SIGHING)
My life's a mess, Sally.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.344
Our life's a mess, Tom.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.184
Look!
There's the Big Dipper.

10:17.250 --> 10:21.154
Oh, I don't give a shit
about the Big Dipper!

10:21.221 --> 10:23.957
Damn it,
I care about us.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.227
(SOBBING) I care about why
you keep pushing me away.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.529
I thought you said
all this could wait,
sweetheart.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.564
Wait? I've been waiting
for two years, Tom.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.602
Ever since Luke died.
I know how you feel
about him.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.906
I just don't know how
you feel about me anymore.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.941
(CHUCKLES)
Don't take it personally, Sal.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.077
I don't know how I feel
about anything anymore.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.548
God, you're pathetic.

Lady, what are you
honking at me for?

11:52.612 --> 11:54.181
TOM: It was
only my sister

11:54.247 --> 11:58.018
who could force me to come
to this god-awful city.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.453
This city that roars
down on you.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.925
She loved it all.
The muggers, the winos,

12:04.992 --> 12:09.196
the bag ladies,
the wall-to-wall noise.

12:09.262 --> 12:13.533
She loved it because
it had nothing to do
with our childhood.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.635
Luke and I hated it

12:15.702 --> 12:17.938
for exactly
the same reason.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.378
You're...

12:47.935 --> 12:49.102
Hello.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.274
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.
You must be Tom, hmm?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.509
Yes, ma'am.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.047
Why don't you come in?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.454
You can leave
your things there.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.829
Uh, am I supposed to
lie down on the couch,

13:15.896 --> 13:18.631
or are we gonna make
polite chitchat first?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.968
How about
a cup of coffee?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.303
Oh. Oh, we're gonna make
polite chitchat first.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.138
Was that yes or no
to the coffee?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.707
It's a yes, ma'am.

13:27.774 --> 13:31.078
Cream and sugar?
And you don't have to
call me ma'am, you know.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.414
Oh, that's
my good home training.
And I'm a little nervous.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.649
Cream, no sugar.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.352
Why do you think
you're nervous?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.122
I get nervous
every time my sister
tries to kill herself.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.158
It's a quirk of mine.
A quirk?

13:45.225 --> 13:48.228
I'm sorry.
I was being cynical.
It's a family trait.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.630
Oh, I don't think
Savannah's cynical.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.966
No? She's suicidal.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.436
I wish she was cynical.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.871
How is my sister?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.772
She's out
of physical danger,
but emotionally...

13:59.839 --> 14:01.341
When can I see her?

14:01.408 --> 14:03.343
You'll have to wait
until tomorrow.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.611
Why?
Why can't I go now?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.313
Because she's been
very agitated today.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.881
We're still trying
to quiet her down,

14:07.948 --> 14:09.983
and I think it would be
just too upsetting.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.484
Wouldn't upset me.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.253
No, but it might upset her.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.359
How's your coffee?
Is it hot enough?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.328
It'll do.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.899
In Savannah's poems,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.137
are you the shrimper
or the coach?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.640
The coach.
Luke's the shrimper.
Or was.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.643
And Savannah's
last suicide attempt

14:36.709 --> 14:39.079
was right after his death,
is that correct?

14:39.146 --> 14:41.748
Yeah. She had a few
bad days over it.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.718
Were there other times?

14:45.785 --> 14:49.156
Oh, uh, there might have
been another time

14:49.222 --> 14:52.059
when we were young,
but I'm not sure.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.561
How are you getting paid?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.029
Why are you changing
the subject?

14:56.096 --> 14:59.199
Because I don't like it much.
Is it okay if I smoke?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.368
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.870
(GROANS) Jesus.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.506
How well do you know
your sister's poetry?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.676
I said I was
a coach, Lowenstein,
not an orangutan.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.178
I was also
an English teacher.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.380
Of course
I know her poetry.
She's my twin.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.383
I know her stuff a hell
of a lot better than you do.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.751
You don't like
psychiatrists much,
do you?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.387
Why should I?
What good do
you people do?

15:20.453 --> 15:23.923
You ask a lot of questions,
and I'm sick of this
whole damn routine.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.693
I'm sick of my sister's
attraction to razor blades,

15:26.759 --> 15:30.230
and I'm sick of shrinks
who can't do a fucking
thing to help her!

15:30.297 --> 15:33.366
Well, I don't know if I can
help your sister either.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.502
(SIGHS) But I do know...

15:35.568 --> 15:37.937
I'm not going
to give up trying.
Why not?

15:38.005 --> 15:40.407
Maybe she just wants
to die too damn much, huh?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.909
And that's okay with you?
You sound resigned
to losing her.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.478
Oh, hell, no,
it's not okay with me.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.884
Yeah, but I am resigned.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.654
Then I don't think
you can help me
with Savannah.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.357
I'm sorry you had
to come all this way.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.930
What do you want from me?

16:04.764 --> 16:06.966
Information.

16:07.034 --> 16:11.238
You see, I've only been
Savannah's doctor
for a few months,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.740
and there's so much more
I need to know about her.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.143
I need to hear the stories
of her childhood,

16:16.209 --> 16:18.445
and she can't tell me
because there are whole
portions of her life

16:18.511 --> 16:22.415
that she's blocked out,
blotted out.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.552
So I need you
to be her memory,
in a sense

16:25.618 --> 16:28.988
and fill in
the missing details.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.992
(SCOFFS) I've spent
my life trying to forget
those missing details.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.362
I beg your pardon?
I said...

16:36.863 --> 16:39.532
Oh, God,
she's a pain
in the ass.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.836
(SIGHS)
What time tomorrow?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.308
I'll meet you
at the hospital at noon.
All right.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.411
What's the matter?
Do you have a headache?
Oh, a doozy.

16:51.478 --> 16:55.382
You wouldn't have any
morphine handy would you?
Morphine?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.484
That's a joke,
Lowenstein.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.186
Hmm.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.458
(HORN HONKING)
Come on, get out
of the way, kid.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.627
If you don't move it, man,
you're gonna get hurt.
Screw you, man.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.696
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.836
You gonna help me
with the bags?
Are you out of your mind?

17:16.903 --> 17:19.271
Are you crazy?
I ain't helping you
with no bags.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.844
CAB DRIVER: Come on, move!
Get out of the way!

17:24.911 --> 17:26.512
MAN: Yo, taxi!

17:26.579 --> 17:28.481
BOY: Don't yell at me!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.164
Shit! Shit!

17:44.231 --> 17:48.168
Move your ass an inch,
motherfucker, and you can
kiss it goodbye.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.070
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Go ahead and shoot.
I've had a rotten day.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.341
Tom! You should have
told me you were coming.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.776
The gun, Eddie.
The gun.
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.146
Savannah and I
have been robbed
twice this year.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.114
They're leaping
from fire escapes now.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.815
One guy landed
on my air conditioner.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.218
I greased my window sills.
That didn't help at all.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.054
Oh, I love New York.
Oh, tell me about it.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.191
How's Andrew?
Gone. Said
he needed space,

18:11.258 --> 18:14.194
so he found
a younger man
with a duplex.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.862
It's his loss, Eddie.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.364
Bless you.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.334
Savannah was an angel.
I practically lived
over here.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.203
So you're alone now, huh?

18:23.270 --> 18:27.174
Well, unless I can tempt you
into crossing the line
while you're here, Coach.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.709
(CHUCKLING) I got
enough troubles, Eddie.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.011
Actually, you look
terrible, Tom.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.780
I mean, you're not
even cute anymore.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.683
Now, if that's
your idea of seduction,
no wonder you're alone.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.385
Well, it isn't easy.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.254
Did you know
Savannah was seeing
a psychiatrist again?

18:41.321 --> 18:43.823
Of course.
I recommended her.
She's a friend of mine.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.170
It was a bitch
washing it out.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.539
You found her?

19:08.248 --> 19:10.317
We've been giving her
50 milligrams,
three times a day.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.985
Mmm-hmm. I'd bring it
down to 25.

19:13.052 --> 19:17.657
WOMAN OVER PA:
Dr. Klein, extension 242.
Dr. Klein, extension 242.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
Don't expect too much.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.203

I need to see you
a minute, please.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.405
(MONITOR BEEPING)

19:51.358 --> 19:53.059
Hey, Savannah.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.362
Hey, darling.
It's me, Tom.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.001
I have a cancellation,
so why don't you meet me

20:02.068 --> 20:04.937
here at the hospital
in 45 minutes, okay?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.806
All right.
I'm on the third floor.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.207
What the hell
is going on here?

20:08.275 --> 20:10.076
Why is she strapped
down like that?

20:10.142 --> 20:12.412
I know you're upset,
but her team felt
she had to be restrained.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.981
Why? She has
enough drugs in her
to anesthetize a whale.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.217
Her team decides what...
Would you quit
calling them her team?

20:18.285 --> 20:20.820
Sounds like she's trying out
for the New York Giants.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.122
What would you like me
to call them?
Let's be creative.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.957
Call them assholes.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.694
Let me tell you
something about those
assholes, Mr. Wingo.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.463
I'm very grateful to them
because they saved
your sister's life.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.232
I don't like to
see her strapped down.
I don't care what you like.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.867
She's still
a threat to herself.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.104
And there's no point
to any of this unless
we can keep Savannah alive.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.039
And I don't care
if it takes drugs
or voodoo

20:40.106 --> 20:43.075
or reading
the goddamn tarot cards,
I want her alive.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.944
Do you understand me?

20:47.547 --> 20:50.950
You know, when I'm not
picking straw out of my teeth,
I'm a very smart man.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.523
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to sound condescending.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.026
You're tough, Lowenstein.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.728
And I'm starving.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.531
Any interest in lunch?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.634
Only if you let me pay.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.637
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, I insist.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.440

to Lutece or Le Cirque.

Thank you.
Oh. Thank you.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.078
Tell me something.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.748
Why do you think
your father wouldn't
answer my telegram?

21:21.814 --> 21:25.552
Dad only likes good news.
Besides, the shrimp
are running good.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.454

I spoke to and, uh...

My mother's
too busy hiring a caterer
for my stepfather's birthday.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.931
Do you always
make jokes in place
of conversation?

21:38.998 --> 21:41.133
It's the Southern way,
ma'am.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.103
"Southern way"?

21:44.170 --> 21:45.905
It's my mother's own
immortal phrase.

21:45.972 --> 21:50.610
When things get too painful,
we either avoid them
or we laugh.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.812
When do you cry, according
to the Southern way?

21:52.879 --> 21:56.015
(LAUGHS)
We don't.

21:56.082 --> 21:59.085
Jesus. Even Sally makes
better chili than this.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.620
I have a really good recipe,
if you're interested.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.154
No, thanks.
I never cook.

anything to you?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.569
No. Why?

22:16.636 --> 22:18.438
It was something Savannah
kept repeating

22:18.505 --> 22:20.573
when she first came
out of the coma.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.410
"Callanwolde,
callanwolde." No?

24:45.985 --> 24:49.021
Put your hands in your lap.
Sit up straight.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.658
Come on, sit up straight.
You gonna cry now?

24:51.724 --> 24:54.794
Savannah, go get
this little girl
one of your dresses.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.629
Why do you have to be
so mean, Daddy?

24:56.696 --> 24:58.931
Henry, why don't I
get you another supper?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.667
There's some
leftover hash and rice.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.101
I'll heat it up
for you, all right?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.670
Give me a hand here, Tom.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.505
Yes, you go out
in the kitchen with
the rest of the girls.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.775
Why don't you bully
on somebody your own size?

25:08.841 --> 25:12.612
And you? Huh? Huh?
What, can't anyone take
a joke around here?

25:12.679 --> 25:16.749
(RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES)
YOUNG SAVANNAH:
I'll help, Mama.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.886
I want you to melt
this butter, Savannah.
And heat up this rice.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.954
Chop that onion in fine
little pieces, Tom.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.023
HENRY: I like American food.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.627
YOUNG SAVANNAH:
I'm sorry, Mama.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.361
LILA: Sorry?
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.898
Marry into nothin',
you get nothin'.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.534
(HENRY CONTINUES SHOUTING)
Add some pepper, Tom.

25:35.602 --> 25:39.138
Hand me that
Worcestershire sauce
out of the cupboard.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.709
HENRY: When I come home
I want something
I want to eat.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.877
Your mouth is
hanging open, child.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.545
Come home here and they
expect me to eat something

25:46.613 --> 25:49.348
the dumbest dog
in the world won't eat.
Nice and spicy.

25:49.415 --> 25:54.286
Shrimp Newburg?
All I want is a good,
plain American meal.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.222
LILA: There you go, darling.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.363
Now this is food, Lila.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.334
(BARKS)

26:08.400 --> 26:10.302
LILA: Eat up, children.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.808
(LAUGHS) So your mother
fed him dog food, huh?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.177
Yeah. He even asked
for a second helping.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.981
(CHUCKLES) Maybe that's where
you got your sense of humor.
From your mother.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.250
Oh, very funny.
Very funny.
She called today.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.985
Very concerned
about Savannah.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.955
Don't believe
a word she says.
She's a liar.

26:29.021 --> 26:32.558
That's interesting.
She said you tell lies
about her.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.560
That figures.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.929
You know, I saw
Herbert Woodruff come out
of your office the other day.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.597
He sure can
play the fiddle.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.532
You're changing
the subject again.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.935
(CHUCKLES)
What's wrong with him?

26:43.636 --> 26:45.772
Just kidding.

26:45.838 --> 26:49.308
Still, it's hard to believe
that anybody that makes that
kind of money has troubles.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.343
Are you really
that provincial?

26:51.410 --> 26:53.880
Oh, hell, yes.
So is Savannah.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.416
When we were kids,
the only way we'd get
off our island was by boat.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.485
We grew up
on a tidal plain.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.788
A tidal plain?
What does that mean?

27:01.854 --> 27:04.657
(CHUCKLING)
Tides mean everything,
Lowenstein.

27:04.724 --> 27:10.262
They measure everything.
Moods, seasons,
time to plant, to fish,

27:11.497 --> 27:13.432
to mate.

27:13.499 --> 27:17.236
It's primitive.
Biological clocks ticking
all over the place.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.206
Hmm.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.675
It sounds like
a nice way to live.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.114
What else did she say,
my mother?

27:28.180 --> 27:31.751
She said that she was the one
who encouraged Savannah
to become a poet.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.252
Is that true?

27:33.319 --> 27:37.824
(LAUGHS) Jesus Christ.
That woman has no shame.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.059
You want to know how
she encouraged Savannah
to write?

27:40.126 --> 27:43.229
By burning the journals
she kept as a child.
Why would she burn them?

27:43.295 --> 27:47.633
Because Savannah was
being disloyal, writing
about our hideous family.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.636
What's hideous
about your family?

27:50.703 --> 27:52.371
Are you asking me
to be disloyal?

27:52.438 --> 27:55.842
If that's what it takes
to help Savannah, yes.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.077
(SIGHING)
Aren't we about done?
What time is it?

27:58.144 --> 27:59.411
Mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.248
We still have
a few more minutes.
Mmm.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.954
What did Savannah do
after your mother
burned her journals?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.289
She took her finger
and she wrote in the sand,

28:10.356 --> 28:11.891
and then she wrote
in the air.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.626
She began writing poetry
so my mother wouldn't
understand it.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.263
So in a sense,
your mother was right.
She did help create a poet.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.899
Oh, bullshit, Lowenstein.
She created a schizophrenic.

28:19.966 --> 28:23.736
My mother should have
raised cobras, not children.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.672
Can you tell me
anything good
about your parents?

28:26.739 --> 28:28.074
No.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.042
Try.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.379
(SIGHING)

28:35.447 --> 28:38.184
Okay. They did two
really good things.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.920
Luke and Savannah.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.755
Incredible people.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.858
Passionate, defiant,
not for sale.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.628
What about you?

28:49.695 --> 28:53.866
Oh, I was a courteous
Southern boy that did
what he was told.

28:53.933 --> 28:58.070
I was responsible
and normal and dull.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.908
I don't know what normal is,
and you're anything but dull.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.876
Compared to them I was.

29:06.145 --> 29:10.182
Meanwhile, your sister's
in the hospital
and your brother's dead.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.651
You must be doing
something right.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.097
You can go now.
Hmm?

29:27.066 --> 29:28.400
Time's up.

29:29.735 --> 29:30.736
Good night.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.040
Good night.

29:36.008 --> 29:39.245
TOM: "Women and men,
both little and small,

29:39.311 --> 29:41.981
"cared for anyone
not at all.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.951
"They sowed their isn't,
they reaped their same.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.120
"Sun, moon, stars, rain.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.490
"Children guessed
but only a few.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.626
"And down they forgot
as up they grew."

29:54.693 --> 29:57.429
TOM: So this began a series
of confessional days

29:57.496 --> 30:00.332
when I spun out the history
of Savannah's past

30:00.399 --> 30:02.801
in order to keep her alive.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.471
By the second week,
I'd developed
the first symptom

30:05.537 --> 30:07.539
of the New York willies,

30:07.606 --> 30:09.708
the guilt that every
out-of-towner feels

30:09.775 --> 30:11.477
if he's not
improving his mind

30:11.543 --> 30:13.579
every goddamn second.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.948
I made a list of things
I should do.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.551
Museums, plays, run six miles
in under 50 minutes,

30:19.618 --> 30:22.354
see three foreign films
all at the same time.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.892
Anything not to feel guilty.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.861
LOWENSTEIN: Tom,
how old was Savannah
when you first realized

30:28.928 --> 30:30.729
something was wrong
with her?

30:30.796 --> 30:32.831
TOM: About seven or eight.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.901
Anything specific happen?

30:36.735 --> 30:37.937
Well,

30:39.271 --> 30:42.008
my mother had
a baby at home.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.943
It was stillborn.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.247
She told us it died
'cause we were bad.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.551
Anyway, we were going
to bury it the next day,

30:52.618 --> 30:56.255
so Dad wrapped it
in some towels
and put it in the freezer.

30:57.823 --> 31:01.593
That night I got up
to get a drink of water,

31:01.660 --> 31:05.297
and I saw Savannah sitting
in the rocking chair

31:05.364 --> 31:07.599
with the dead baby
in her arms.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.071
She was saying,

31:12.138 --> 31:15.942
"You're the lucky one,
'cause you don't have
to live with us."

31:18.044 --> 31:20.579
Did you say
anything to her?

31:22.181 --> 31:25.985
The next day I did,
but she didn't remember
anything about it.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.755
(SIGHS) When I
told her what happened,
all she said was,

31:29.821 --> 31:33.025
"Why would anyone do
a crazy thing like that?"
Hmm.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.395
So...

31:37.763 --> 31:39.966
You were her memory
even then.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.837
I guess so.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.741
Uh-huh.

How's it going down there?

Well, it's just sort of
blowing up a storm.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.414
I got the girls' drawings.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.050
Did they get my letters?
Yup, and they loved 'em.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.719
Oh, good.
Did you get my letter?

32:34.520 --> 32:37.089
Uh, Tom?

32:37.156 --> 32:40.492
I don't think it's
a good idea for you
to come home this weekend.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.561
Why not?

32:43.395 --> 32:44.763
Well, I'm not sure.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.099
I'm just not sure
that I want to see you
right now.

I have a lot
to figure out.

What's the point, Tom?

32:58.244 --> 33:01.080
We don't make each other
feel good anymore.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.315
Right.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.517
Look, uh,

33:07.519 --> 33:11.623
I didn't want
to tell you this
on the telephone.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.459
I wanted to tell you
before you left,

33:13.525 --> 33:15.627
but the way you left,

33:17.396 --> 33:19.265
there wasn't any time.

to tell me, Sally?

I disappoint you, Sally,

to feel that way.

be disappointed?

You're the only Wingo
who's gonna amount
to something.

37:09.828 --> 37:13.131
Luke can't do it
because he isn't smart.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.667
Savannah can't do it
because she's just a girl.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.270
But Luke's smart, Mama.
Not like you.

Yes, ma'am.

I'm not gonna die
in a house like this,
I promise you that.

I do.

fell on the floor howling.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.993
You see, my mother
took each of them
into that room

38:48.059 --> 38:50.596
and told them
exactly the same thing.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.764
Hmm.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.536
Why did you
tell me that story?

38:57.603 --> 39:00.506
(SCOFFING)
To prove that
Lila Wingo would...

39:03.375 --> 39:07.145
Oh, just to show
why Savannah could
never trust her.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.848
You mean why you
could never trust her.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.050
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
That's the wrong story.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.654
Let's just skip it
and I'll try to think
of a better one.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.657
What's bothering you?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.729
Global warming, acid rain,
the national debt.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.964
Oh, and my wife's having
a goddamn affair

39:26.031 --> 39:28.266
with a heart surgeon
in South Carolina.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.069
Hmm.
Jesus, I feel like
such an idiot!

39:32.838 --> 39:35.306
I never even knew
it was going on.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.076
Maybe you weren't
paying attention.
Oh, bullshit.

39:38.143 --> 39:42.180
Now, let's face it,
Lowenstein, women are
more devious than men.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.716
Yeah, you're great
at hiding things.
You keep secrets.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.852
You smile when you lie.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.721
You expect a man to be
a tower of strength,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.623
and when it turns out
he's got a few weaknesses

39:51.690 --> 39:53.425
and some insecurities,
what do you do?

39:53.492 --> 39:56.361
You turn around,
and God damn it,
you betray him.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.965
So you feel that
your mother betrayed you?

40:00.031 --> 40:02.133
I was talking
about my wife!

40:04.335 --> 40:05.871
Oh.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.773
Oh, God, I hate
this Freudian crap.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.875
And it's not
your job to listen to
my problems anyway.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.743
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to go.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.045
You're free to leave
any time you want.
Good.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.684
TOM: Goddamn shrink.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.019
Who was I kidding?

40:21.086 --> 40:24.155
I was a champion
at keeping secrets,

40:24.222 --> 40:26.224
better than any woman.

40:27.392 --> 40:30.028
Until Susan Lowenstein
came along.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.999
A man who never talked

40:34.065 --> 40:36.768
now is doing nothing else,

40:36.835 --> 40:41.406
her questions making me
as dizzy as her perfume.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.808
(DANCE MUSIC
PLAYING ON STEREO)

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

40:47.613 --> 40:49.280
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

40:57.656 --> 40:59.190
Excuse me.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.561
Would you like to dance?

41:04.162 --> 41:06.097
Who, me?
Yes, you.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.199
(LAUGHS)
Come on.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.969
No, no, no, no.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.971
Come on, just loosen up.
No, I'm, uh...

41:13.038 --> 41:16.274
Hey, hands to yourself.
He's spoken for.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.677
Tom, how's Savannah?
When can I see her?

41:18.744 --> 41:21.547
Well, I don't know, Eddie.
It's a little like
talking to a fern.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.649
Well, I'm glad
she's improving.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.483
Come on. Let's dance.
No, no.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.853
Come on, give me a break.
I'm a lousy dancer.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.656
Oh, come on.
Walk on the wild side.
You're in the big city.

41:30.722 --> 41:33.959
Oh, no.
Well, all right.
What the hell.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.336
God, you are
a lousy dancer.

41:45.403 --> 41:49.074
Go mingle.
Come on, get in here.
Get into the party.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.076
MAN: Hey, Eddie,
where are my chairs?

41:51.142 --> 41:54.145
EDDIE: I found
four of them, and I have
a lead on another two.

41:54.212 --> 41:57.415
Roberta, have I got
a settee for you.

41:57.482 --> 41:59.017
Don't laugh.
(LAUGHING) All right.

41:59.084 --> 42:02.588
You're laughing.
I'm sorry.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.455
I'm surprised
to see you here.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.024
Why? I like Eddie.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.760
You know, I...

42:08.827 --> 42:11.730
You really
pissed me off today,

42:11.797 --> 42:13.899
but you made me think
about some things.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.568
Well, don't make it a habit,
or I'll have to start
charging you.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.770
Oh! We do have
a sense of humor.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.339
I was beginning to think
you had it surgically removed.

42:21.406 --> 42:22.674
(CHUCKLING)

42:24.175 --> 42:26.011
You look mighty pretty
tonight, ma'am.

42:27.178 --> 42:30.248
Thank you.
Are you all right?

42:30.315 --> 42:32.851
Oh, God, I'm great.
I'm just great.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.455
Now that I've finished lying,
can I ask you to dance?

42:37.522 --> 42:39.190
Mmm-mmm.
No?

42:39.257 --> 42:43.194
No.
You'd be the first woman I've
danced with in New York City.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.830
I'd rather not.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.833
Come on, Lowenstein.
Walk on the wild side.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.534
No, I...
Come on.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.170
It's a party.
Come on. Don't worry.

42:52.237 --> 42:55.040
I can't dance
and make a pass
at the same time.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.608
I'd lose count.
Mmm-hmm.

42:56.675 --> 42:57.909
Mmm-hmm.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.984
MAN: I don't wanna...

43:06.051 --> 43:09.755
You came alone?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, it's funny.

43:09.821 --> 43:13.291
I never went anywhere alone
until I got married.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.627
Well, that speaks well
for matrimony.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.163
No, it's just that

43:18.229 --> 43:20.265
my husband travels a lot.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.970
What does he do?

43:25.036 --> 43:27.172
You know, it's late.
I really should go.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.140
I'll take you home.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.609
No, no. It's okay.
I'm fine. Really.

43:31.677 --> 43:34.846
I'm a Southerner, ma'am.
We take our ladies home.

43:37.649 --> 43:41.319
How do you do it?
How do you listen to people's
sob stories all day?

43:41.386 --> 43:43.188
Doesn't it depress you?

43:43.254 --> 43:46.157
No, not if I think
I can help them.

43:46.224 --> 43:47.926
Anyway, you learn

43:47.993 --> 43:51.596
to separate
your patients' problems
from your own.

43:51.663 --> 43:53.865
Now, yours,
I think I could handle.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.533
Oh, yeah?
Don't be so sure.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.335
(CHUCKLES)

43:57.402 --> 43:59.070
Tell me something.

44:00.405 --> 44:03.374
Did you ever
want to write,
like Savannah?

44:03.441 --> 44:04.810
(LAUGHS)

44:04.876 --> 44:07.813
You're changing
the subject, Lowenstein.

44:07.879 --> 44:09.247
Am I?
Mmm-hmm.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.950
It's a technique
I'm learning from you.
Oh.

44:12.017 --> 44:14.152
Oh, there he is again.
You see him?

44:14.219 --> 44:16.888
That guy is following me.

44:16.955 --> 44:20.058
So you're a shrink
to the stars, huh?

44:20.125 --> 44:22.828
He's not my patient.
He's my husband.

44:24.262 --> 44:25.663
(LAUGHING)

44:25.731 --> 44:28.499
No kidding.
Herbert fucking Woodruff
is your husband?

44:28.566 --> 44:31.402
Herbert Woodruff is
my husband, yes.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.805
How'd you meet him?

44:33.872 --> 44:37.743
I saw him perform at,
uh, Carnegie Hall.

44:37.809 --> 44:39.544
I was 22 years old.

44:41.412 --> 44:43.348
Oh, I had never heard
anything like it.

44:43.414 --> 44:46.451
I mean, that kind of

44:46.517 --> 44:48.553
passion, artistry,
whatever you call it.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.922
You know,
it's like Savannah's.

44:50.989 --> 44:53.725
They have that gift
to make people feel.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.929
I fell in love
with him instantly.

45:03.001 --> 45:06.738
So you married him
and then you lived
happily ever after, huh?

45:06.805 --> 45:08.706
I married him.

45:08.774 --> 45:11.877
What are you telling me? That
mine isn't the only screwed
up union on the planet?

45:11.943 --> 45:14.112
I'm not telling you
anything more.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.181
Now, no fair.
I spill my guts to you.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.183
I tell you my marriage
is full of holes,

45:18.249 --> 45:20.251
but when I ask you something,
you got nothing to say.

45:20.318 --> 45:23.021
Now I think it's your turn
to give a little.
No.

45:23.088 --> 45:25.656
Oh, come on, Lowenstein,
be human. Now talk to me.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.625
Tell me something
about yourself.
I can't. I can't.

45:27.692 --> 45:30.061
God, why are there
never any cabs
when you want them?

45:30.128 --> 45:32.463
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll ask a few
simple questions

45:32.530 --> 45:34.132
and you just answer them.

45:34.199 --> 45:35.834
Simple?
Yeah. It's very simple.

45:35.901 --> 45:38.336
Like, what's
your father's name?
Douglas.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.938
What's your favorite car?

45:40.005 --> 45:42.874
Um, I like those
old Ford Woodies.
Oh, good.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.475
Who's the first boy
you ever kissed?

45:44.542 --> 45:46.211
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

45:46.277 --> 45:48.313
Dick Berkowitz.
He was very cute.

45:48.379 --> 45:52.717
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you look
in that suit?

45:52.784 --> 45:55.253
What is this,
Make Lowenstein
Feel Better Day?

45:55.320 --> 45:58.289
And you've got
a great smile.
You should smile more.

45:58.356 --> 46:00.091
Stop.
You don't believe me,
do you?

46:00.158 --> 46:02.660
Come on.
Come here.
Let me show you something.

46:02.727 --> 46:05.330
What?
Come here.
Let me show you.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.565
Right there.
A painting?
You're gonna show me a...

46:07.632 --> 46:10.468
No. You. Look at you. You.
Your face, your smile.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.938
Your suit. I'm talking
great stuff here.

46:13.004 --> 46:15.540
Beautiful.
Okay, you convinced me.

46:15.606 --> 46:18.576
Now would you please
get me a cab?
Mmm-hmm.

46:23.181 --> 46:24.582
LOWENSTEIN:
Why don't you come up
for a minute?

46:24.649 --> 46:27.485
I'd like you
to meet my son.
TOM: Sure. Okay.

46:28.219 --> 46:29.821
(TV PLAYING)

46:29.888 --> 46:31.289
Come on in.

46:33.658 --> 46:34.926
Bernard?

46:38.429 --> 46:42.033
Bernard, I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.768
How do you do?

46:43.835 --> 46:45.904
Would you mind stepping
out of the way?

46:45.971 --> 46:49.607
Oh. Excuse me.
Mr. Wingo is a football
coach, Bernard.

46:49.674 --> 46:52.878
Oh, yeah?
Oh, Dad called
from Vienna today.

46:52.944 --> 46:55.646
He said to say hi to you
when I saw you.

46:59.317 --> 47:02.053
Did you practice
this afternoon?

47:02.120 --> 47:03.855
No. I've been too busy
watching TV.

47:03.922 --> 47:08.126
You're being rude,
Bernard.
No, he's being a teenager.

47:08.193 --> 47:11.329
I used to be one
myself.
No kidding.

47:11.396 --> 47:12.597
Mmm-hmm.

47:13.965 --> 47:16.034
Where are you from?
Your accent's weird.

47:16.101 --> 47:18.803
South Carolina.
Hmm.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.642
Is this TV you're
watching or a video?
Would you stop talking?

47:24.709 --> 47:26.878
I'm trying to watch
this movie.
All right, it's late.

47:26.945 --> 47:29.414
Come on.
It's time for bed, Bernard.
Let's go.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.316
Turn down the TV
and go to bed. Now.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.184
I'll see you, Bernard.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.289
(STAMMERING)
Tom, I'm

47:38.356 --> 47:41.126
sorry that he was
so rude to you.
No, no, no.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.361
You don't have
to apologize,
Lowenstein.

47:43.428 --> 47:47.032
Teenagers, by definition,
are not fit for society.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.866
That's true. Um...

47:50.101 --> 47:51.569
Bernard wants
to play football.

47:51.636 --> 47:54.839
That's why
I brought you up here
to meet him.

47:54.906 --> 47:59.477
I thought that maybe
you could coach him
a couple of days a week.

47:59.544 --> 48:04.182
You see, he never
gets a chance to play
while his father's around.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.850
So, Herbert's on tour.
I thought that maybe...

48:05.917 --> 48:07.752
Is this a job offer?

48:07.818 --> 48:11.456
Yes. Yes, and I would
insist on paying you.

48:11.522 --> 48:14.392
What would you consider
a reasonable rate?

48:14.459 --> 48:16.227
What are your rates?

48:18.096 --> 48:20.765
I charge $150 an hour.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.567
Fine. I'll take it.

48:24.169 --> 48:26.204
You must be
a very good coach.

48:26.271 --> 48:27.605
(LAUGHING)

48:30.608 --> 48:33.478
Forget it, Lowenstein.
I'm not a charity case yet.

48:33.544 --> 48:36.647
Tell Bernard
we'll start on Monday.
Good.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.849
Good night.
Good night.

48:39.617 --> 48:41.219
(BELL TOLLING)

48:41.286 --> 48:42.787
(EXHALES)

48:52.630 --> 48:54.899
First rule of thumb,
Bernard. Never be late.

48:54.966 --> 48:56.934
I didn't want
to come anyway, okay?

48:57.002 --> 48:59.937
Well, your mother thinks
you want to play ball.
Is there any truth to that?

49:00.005 --> 49:01.672
Maybe. Maybe not.

49:03.241 --> 49:06.311
So where do you coach,
Mr. Wingo, hillbilly country?

49:06.377 --> 49:10.281
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, we're a little
class conscious, are we?

49:10.348 --> 49:12.083
Where do you go to school,
Miss Porter's?

49:12.150 --> 49:14.252
Phillips Exeter, smart-ass.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.356
You didn't get to play
last year, did you?

49:19.890 --> 49:21.692
How'd you know?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.361
Because any rich,
snot-nosed punk

49:23.428 --> 49:25.430
that would dare
call his coach
a smart-ass

49:25.496 --> 49:28.766
wouldn't get to haul water,
let alone play.

49:28.833 --> 49:31.636
With your attitude you belong
in the bleachers, kid.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.140
When you get ready
to play football,

49:35.206 --> 49:37.975
you get my number
from your mother. Catch.

49:48.819 --> 49:50.955
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

50:29.994 --> 50:32.697
Hey, you need help.

50:32.763 --> 50:35.366
This is not
an attractive look
for a middle-aged man.

50:35.433 --> 50:37.001
When are you gonna
take me shopping?

50:37.068 --> 50:40.138
Say, did you ever hear
of a woman named
Renata Halpern?

50:40.205 --> 50:42.073
No. Who is she?
I don't know,
but she writes

50:42.140 --> 50:44.809
good poems
about growing up
Jewish in Brooklyn.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.844
Are you sure
she wasn't staying
with Savannah recently?

50:46.911 --> 50:48.946
Not that I know of.
Of course, I've been
out of town a lot.

50:49.013 --> 50:52.183
All right.
Bloomingdale's
on Saturday, big boy.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.351
Okay.

50:59.157 --> 51:00.558
Coach Wingo?

51:01.859 --> 51:04.195
Look, um, you know,
yesterday...

51:04.262 --> 51:06.764
(STAMMERING) I mean, I...
You know, I...

51:08.466 --> 51:11.102
I accept your
apology, Bernard.

51:11.169 --> 51:14.205
I didn't get to
play last year 'cause
I never made the team.

51:14.272 --> 51:15.873
I mean,
they made fun of me.

51:15.940 --> 51:18.843
If I coach you, Bernard,
I promise you they won't
make fun of you,

51:18.909 --> 51:20.778
but you've got
to promise me something.
What?

51:20.845 --> 51:23.648
You gotta shut up, Bernard.
Your mouth pisses me off.

51:23.714 --> 51:26.617
Oh, yeah. Okay, okay.
"Yes, sir" is the correct way
to address me.

51:26.684 --> 51:29.454
Now, first thing
we're gonna do is follow
certain forms and courtesies.

51:29.520 --> 51:32.723
You'll do whatever
I tell you to do and you'll
do it with enthusiasm.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.025
I'm gonna teach you
to play football,
and I'm gonna teach you well.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.827
I'm gonna run
your ass off
every day.

51:36.894 --> 51:39.264
Wait a sec.
I have my violin lessons.
Shut up, Bernard.

51:39.330 --> 51:41.432
Yes, sir.
And after I run you
until you drop,

51:41.499 --> 51:42.933
make you lift weights
until you can't move,

51:43.000 --> 51:44.902
make you tackle
until your arms cramp,

51:44.969 --> 51:48.206
something's gonna happen
to you that's never happened
in your miserable little life.

51:48.273 --> 51:51.876
What's that, sir?
You're gonna be happy, kid.

51:51.942 --> 51:54.679
Move 'em! Move 'em! Hit it!

51:54.745 --> 51:57.715
(GASPS)
Come on. Get up.

51:57.782 --> 52:01.018
Drop that leg. Roll.
Drop this leg. Roll.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.521
That's it.
All right, let's see
that smile.

52:03.588 --> 52:05.523
Do it again
with a smile.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.593
Cross, back.
Cross. That's it.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.296
Cross 'em over.
Cross, back. Cross.

52:11.362 --> 52:14.165
Bring this shoulder out.
Bring this shoulder.

52:14.232 --> 52:16.601
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Concentrate. Concentrate.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.403
Come on, Bernard.
Get your hands up.
Come on.

52:18.469 --> 52:22.673
(LAUGHS) Come on, get it.
Bernard, turn around and run!

52:22.740 --> 52:26.577
GIRLS ON PHONE:
You're the greatest person
in the whole world, Daddy.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.179
(LAUGHING) Well,
now, what's this?

52:28.246 --> 52:30.815
I don't even get
the pleasure of asking
the questions anymore?

52:30.881 --> 52:32.350
When you coming
home, Daddy?

52:32.417 --> 52:33.818
TOM: I'm coming home soon.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.321
If you miss my birthday,
I'm gonna kill you.

52:36.387 --> 52:38.489
Chandler, how could
I miss your birthday?

52:38.556 --> 52:41.626
I was there the day
you pushed your way
into the world.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.294
I want an alligator.

52:43.361 --> 52:45.296
You go down to the marsh
and you get one.

52:45.363 --> 52:48.833
I want a stuffed alligator
so he can sleep in bed
with me.

52:48.899 --> 52:52.370
Now that's a dangerous
habit to get into, kiddo.
Is Mama there?

52:52.437 --> 52:54.639
Mommy, Daddy wants
to talk to you.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.441
Okay.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.409
Hi.
Oh, hi, Sal.

52:58.476 --> 53:00.811
Listen, I really
want to come home
for Chandler's birthday.

53:00.878 --> 53:02.613
It'll only be
for a couple of days.
No, we'd...

53:02.680 --> 53:05.149
We'd all be upset
if you didn't come, Tom.

53:05.216 --> 53:07.518
Oh, good.
Well, thanks, Sally.

53:07.585 --> 53:09.854
Okay. I'll talk to you. Bye.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.756
All right. Bye-bye.

53:14.459 --> 53:16.794
Set! Move!

53:16.861 --> 53:19.264
Come on,
keep your balance.
Keep your balance.

53:19.330 --> 53:21.632
Keep your balance.
All right, square.
All right.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.634
All right, pop me.
Pop me. Pop me.

53:23.701 --> 53:27.104
Bernard, pop me! That's it!
See how you don't move?

53:27.171 --> 53:31.141
Cross it over! Cross it over!
Cross it over! Cross it over!
Cross it over! Cross it over!

53:31.208 --> 53:32.277
TOM: Hut!

53:33.378 --> 53:35.480
Pass it! Good!

53:35.546 --> 53:37.748
Coach, what are you doing?
You got a broken cigarette.

53:37.815 --> 53:39.717
You're taking
my cigarette away?

53:39.784 --> 53:42.820
TOM: So this became
my routine. Coaching Bernard
in the morning,

53:42.887 --> 53:47.558
and in the afternoon,
telling the Wingo family
secrets to his mother.

53:47.625 --> 53:50.094
And looking forward
to telling them.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.063
Or looking forward
to seeing her.

53:53.130 --> 53:56.334
LOWENSTEIN: It's as if
Savannah has some
kind of a splinter,

53:56.401 --> 53:58.536
you know,
that she's neglected.

53:58.603 --> 54:01.071
And, um, it festers...

54:01.138 --> 54:04.609
It festers inside you
until you...
Until you get it out.

54:04.675 --> 54:06.411
You know what I mean?

54:06.477 --> 54:09.480
And the stories you're
telling me are really
helping her remember,

54:09.547 --> 54:12.883
and I'm very proud
of the work we're doing.

54:12.950 --> 54:15.620
Do you know what I mean?
Huh?

54:15.686 --> 54:17.254
(LAUGHS)

54:17.322 --> 54:18.923
Time's up. Out.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.493
Lowenstein. Here. Catch.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.161
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.
My nails.

54:24.228 --> 54:27.031
(LAUGHS) Throw you
the ball? Okay.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.435
(TOM CHEERING)

54:30.501 --> 54:33.170
(LAUGHING)
Yeah! Yeah!

54:33.237 --> 54:35.406
Go! Go! Move!

54:35.473 --> 54:38.609
Hit it! Good, good!
Move, move, move, move!

54:38.676 --> 54:40.578
(COUGHING)

54:40.645 --> 54:42.913
Coach, what are you
trying to do,
kill yourself?

54:42.980 --> 54:45.115
(COUGHS)
I'm not quitting,
Bernard, you hear?

54:45.182 --> 54:47.151
(COUGHING)
Then I'll smoke.

54:47.217 --> 54:49.887
No, you're not smoking.
You're not smoking.

54:49.954 --> 54:52.256
Then throw 'em out.
All right,
I will, I will.

54:52.323 --> 54:55.626
All of them!
Oh, all right.
All right.

54:55.693 --> 54:58.496
Congratulations, Coach.
How do you feel?
I feel better already.

54:58.563 --> 54:59.664
(TOM COUGHING)

55:03.901 --> 55:07.438
TOM: You know,
it's an art form to hate
New York properly.

55:07.505 --> 55:08.873
BERNARD: No, it's not.
It's a cliche.

55:08.939 --> 55:10.741
(TOM LAUGHS)

55:10.808 --> 55:13.177
You're not such
a dumb kid after all,
Bernard.

55:13.243 --> 55:16.146
Let's go to a bookstore.
It's my daughter's birthday
next weekend.

55:16.213 --> 55:18.949
She wants an alligator.
There's a crocodile
in Peter Pan.

55:19.016 --> 55:20.885
Do you think
she'll buy it?

55:20.951 --> 55:22.620
It's my mom's birthday
next week, too.

55:22.687 --> 55:25.390
I'll bet you got her
exactly nothing.
Well...

55:25.456 --> 55:28.426
TOM: Come on. We'll see if
we can find her something.

Shit! Shit!

56:19.610 --> 56:21.812
(DOOR SLAMS)

56:21.879 --> 56:23.247
Who the hell
is Renata Halpern,

56:23.313 --> 56:24.949
and what does she
have to do with my sister?

56:25.015 --> 56:26.451
Why don't you sit down
and cool off for...

56:26.517 --> 56:28.318
You've known about this
the whole time, haven't you?

56:28.385 --> 56:30.220
Tom, I'm finding it
difficult conducting
a session...

56:30.287 --> 56:33.323
This is not a session,
damn it. I'm asking you
a question.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.493
And you're doing
a shitty job of evading it.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.227
Tell me who wrote this book!

56:37.294 --> 56:38.796
What's so disturbing
about it?
That's not the issue.

56:38.863 --> 56:40.898
The issue is why
you didn't tell me.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.567
It wasn't my place
to tell you. Your sister
specifically asked me...

56:42.633 --> 56:44.469
(SCOFFING)
You're a piece of work,
Lowenstein.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.136
I come in here
and I tell you everything.

56:46.203 --> 56:48.038
You withhold
an important piece
of information from me.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.608
Maybe it's you
who's withholding.
This is not about me!

56:50.675 --> 56:53.844
Then why are you so upset?
Because I don't
like being lied to.

56:53.911 --> 56:56.581
I don't like secrets.
I could report you
to the authorities.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.082
Have your goddamn
license suspended.

56:58.148 --> 57:00.417
Tom, stop acting like
a petulant child.

57:00.485 --> 57:03.488
You haven't answered
my question, Lowenstein.
Tell me who wrote this book.

57:03.554 --> 57:06.056
Why don't you tell me?
Oh, I'll tell you.
My sister wrote it.

57:06.123 --> 57:07.892
It's all about
my goddamn family.

57:07.958 --> 57:11.028
If my mother ever read it,
she'd rip out Savannah's
pancreas with her teeth.

57:11.095 --> 57:13.864
Why? Why would she do that?
What are you all hiding?

57:13.931 --> 57:17.401
I don't answer
any more questions
until you answer mine.

57:19.369 --> 57:21.405
Then why don't you
sit down and listen.

57:21.472 --> 57:25.175
That is, if you're not
too exhausted by your
temper tantrum.

57:31.916 --> 57:34.251
Oh, shit!

57:34.318 --> 57:36.420
The first few times
Savannah came to see me,

57:36.487 --> 57:38.022
she told me her name
was Renata Halpern.

57:38.088 --> 57:40.457
(SCOFFS) Jesus. She's even
crazier than I thought.

57:40.525 --> 57:42.993
Shut up or I won't continue.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.795
She told me her father
was a furrier

57:44.862 --> 57:47.898
and that both parents were
survivors of the holocaust.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.767
She couldn't fool me
about being Jewish,

57:49.834 --> 57:53.971
but what fascinated me
was why she chose to be
the child of survivors.

57:54.038 --> 57:56.641
What was she trying
to survive? What is
she trying to survive?

57:56.707 --> 57:58.408
Well, how the hell
would I know?
I think you do.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.811
Come on, Lowenstein.
You're supposed to be
answering my questions.

58:00.878 --> 58:03.247
Why'd she do it?
Something about
writing that book

58:03.313 --> 58:05.583
made her want to
become someone else.
And that was okay with you?

58:05.650 --> 58:08.586
It was not okay with me.
I told her unless she
resolved her own problems,

58:08.653 --> 58:10.420
no one else she'd become
would have a chance.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.558
Is this what
people pay you to do?
Turn them into someone else?

58:13.624 --> 58:15.960
You're not listening to me.
You haven't heard
a goddamn word I've said.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.695
Oh, bullshit!
What do you think
I'm doing here every day?

58:17.762 --> 58:19.463
Complaining, avoiding,
pointing your finger,

58:19.530 --> 58:20.931
Fuck you, Lowenstein!
refusing to
take responsibility.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.600
Fuck you and Sigmund Freud
and my sister Renata Halpern!

58:22.667 --> 58:25.570
The whole thing makes me sick.
The way you're reacting
makes me sick.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.504
How do you expect
me to react?

58:27.572 --> 58:29.239
What if I'd done the same
thing to your son?

58:29.306 --> 58:31.441
It's not the same thing.
"Come on to
South Carolina, Bernard.

58:31.508 --> 58:34.044
"I'll change your name
and turn you into
a Presbyterian quarterback."

58:34.111 --> 58:36.981
It's quite different,
Mr. Wingo. My son didn't
try to kill himself.

58:37.047 --> 58:39.483
Give him time, Lowenstein.
Give him time.

58:39.550 --> 58:40.818
You son of a bitch.

coming out of this, Doctor.

58:50.628 --> 58:52.096
I am so embarrassed.

58:52.162 --> 58:55.566
(LAUGHING) What a day!

58:55.633 --> 58:57.401
I get dropped
by a dictionary,

58:57.467 --> 59:00.070
and I find out my sister's
become a Brooklyn Jew.

59:00.137 --> 59:02.272
Here. Here.
Put this on.
Oh, I don't need that.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.141
I'd rather act like a man
and bleed to death.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.509
Just be quiet
and take it.

59:05.576 --> 59:07.578
(GROANS)

59:07.645 --> 59:10.114
And after you've stopped
bleeding, I'd like
to take you to dinner.

This time it's gonna cost you.

Pretty bloody, isn't it?
TOM: Yeah.

59:22.259 --> 59:24.261
I still can't believe
I did that to you.

59:24.328 --> 59:27.564
Face it, Lowenstein,
I bring out the
animal in you.

59:27.632 --> 59:28.799
Hmm.

59:28.866 --> 59:30.234
I owe you an apology.

59:30.300 --> 59:31.902
I accept.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.838
That was a terrible thing
to say about you.
Yes, it was.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.373
I know it. Jeez.
Thank you for accepting.

59:36.440 --> 59:38.308
WAITER: Would you like
to order now?
Um...

59:38.375 --> 59:40.277
(STAMMERING)
We would like
to order now.

59:40.344 --> 59:43.848
Do you want me
to order for you?
I eat here all the time.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.684
How am I supposed to trust
a woman to order for me
who can't even cook?

59:46.751 --> 59:49.386
Just because I don't know
how to cook doesn't mean
I don't know how to eat.

59:49.453 --> 59:51.088
(CHUCKLING) All right.
Go ahead, Lowenstein.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.524
I'll do anything
to make you happy tonight.
Okay, good.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.894

with the artichaut garni

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.701
Mmm-hmm.
And pour monsieur,

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:07.571
la mousse de canard
aux baies sauvages.

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:11.341
And then we'll have the
soupe de poisson au crabe.

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:12.743
Delicious.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.680
And for our main course,
rable de lapin.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:17.848
WAITER: The rabbit is superb.
Merci.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:25.055
God, there's nothing sexier
than a beautiful woman
ordering food in French.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.724
Why don't you read me
the whole menu?

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.159
Are you flirting
with me, Tom?

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:30.795
Yeah, I think I am.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:34.598
And I'd like you
to find me attractive,
bloody nose and all.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.834
And I'd like to ask you
something about Savannah.

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:39.303
(SCOFFS)
God, don't you ever
take a night off?

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.306
No. You said
you'd do anything
to make me happy.

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.308
Just one thing.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.711
Savannah told me
that her children's book
came out of a dream.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.578
Mmm-hmm.
More like a nightmare.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:52.149
And there were images in it
that terrorized her,
but she didn't know why.

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:53.718
You know,
like the three stray dogs.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:56.353
You've read the story now.
What do you think it means?

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.723
(LAUGHS) Lowenstein,
you're incorrigible.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.258
I mean, here we are,
at a wonderful restaurant,

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:04.028
and you want me to interpret
my sister's dreams?

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.697
You want to
interpret dreams? Do mine.

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:09.399
I had a great one
about you last night.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.870
You had a dream about me?

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:17.441
TOM: Uh-huh, yeah.
You wanna hear?
I'm not sure.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.010
Don't worry.
This one is "G" rated.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.678
This one?
Uh-huh.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.115
Tell me.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.753
There was a blinding
snow storm right here
in New York City.

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:32.556
I went out for a walk
and I ran into you.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:35.192
We decided to go
to the Rainbow Room.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:38.796
No one was there,
so we started to slow dance.

01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:43.433
What do you think it means?

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:48.739
You said it was
a snow storm?
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.674
A blinding snow storm?

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:55.079
Maybe there's something
you're afraid to see.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.115
Maybe I want to get
to know you better.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.417
Maybe you're trying
to snow me.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.253
Maybe I have cold feet.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.692
Maybe you just miss winter.

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.197
Move those legs!
Move them! Move them!

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:14.932
(GRUNTS)
That's it.
Get in position.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:17.034
Keep your head up.
All right. Come!

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:19.203
(EXCLAIMS)

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.139
Is that my son?

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:24.174
Is that you in there,
Bernard?

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.342
BERNARD: Okay,
let's try it again.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.177
I don't think this was
such a good idea.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.946
Stop being a Jewish
mother, Lowenstein.

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:31.181
I am a Jewish mother.
I even brought sandwiches.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.283
TOM: Oh, good.
I'm starving.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.153
I got delicious ones here.
Come on, Bernard.
Take a break.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.723
Great. I got one for you.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.759
Slave away
in the kitchen all day
making those, Mom?

01:02:42.827 --> 01:02:45.429
No, I bought them,
like I usually do.
Would you like one?

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:47.898
No, I'm not hungry.

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:55.539
So, can I watch you play?
I mean, I promise I won't
be overprotective.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.075
I don't really feel
like playing anymore.

01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:01.411
Come on,
let's toss the ball around
for a few minutes.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:04.114
What am I, a trained seal?
I gotta do whatever she wants?

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.050
Oh, you got it tough, kid.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.684
Come on. Let's lie
in the grass

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.720
and cry for all the terrible
misfortune in your life.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.357
You know, you turn into,
like, a real jerk every time
my mother's around.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:15.059
What are you trying to do,
impress her?

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:19.063
You're totally out of line,
Bernard. You're not mad
at him, you're mad at me.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.731
Save that crap
for your patients, Mom.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.870
(SIGHING)

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.206
He's right, you know.

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:30.941
He's absolutely right.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:34.078
I don't know
how to talk to him.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.681
Maybe you should try
a new approach.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.016
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:41.618
Laugh, Lowenstein. Laugh.

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:43.120
The Southern way, hmm?

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:46.756
Yeah. If that doesn't work,
then you bop him on the head.

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:51.161
What do you
think of me, Tom?

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.300
Well, I think
you have it made.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.602
I mean, you're rich,
you live like a queen,

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.370
your kid needs some work,

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.040
but overall, you're
in the top one percent.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.075
You're lying.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.583
I think you're
a very sad woman,
Lowenstein.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:15.519
(SIGHS)

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:20.124
I like it when
you tell the truth.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:24.028
And I think you're
the first friend I've
made in a long time.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:26.330
Come on. Let's go
to the movies.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.665
The movies?
Yeah, come on.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:33.770
TOM: Rare footage
from the Savannah
Wingo archives.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:36.206
LOWENSTEIN: How wonderful.
Where did you find this?

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:39.176
Well, I was snooping
around and I found them.
Savannah must have kept them.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.411
Wait, wait.
Who's that? Luke?
Yeah, that's Luke.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:43.580
He was always
horsing around.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:45.382
Oh. Here's our graduation.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.585
What? From
grade school, right?
Yeah, right. Grade school.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.820
(CHUCKLES)
Did you always jump in
with your clothes on?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.723
(LAUGHING) Yes,
as a matter of fact, we did.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.726
And that's your mother,
Lila?
Yeah, that's Miss Lila.

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.163
Mmm-hmm.
She was very pretty.

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.365
She still is.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.069
So, who took
these pictures?

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:07.371
My father.
You see, he bought
this camera one year.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.638
He thought he would
give up shrimping,

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:09.873
the only thing
he was good at,

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.475
and make
a fortune in film.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.643
Don't ask me how.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.746
Savannah said that
your father was always
losing money.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.582
Is that true?
Oh, that's
an understatement.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:21.518
Henry Wingo had
the opposite of
the Midas touch.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.153
Everything he touched
turned to shit.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.955
What is that?
Tell me what that is.

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:28.325
That is one of
my father's all-time,
cockamamie schemes.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:31.095
What?
Well, you see, he bought
this gas station.

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:33.463
He thought this tiger
would draw people
by the thousands.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:36.233
All it did
was scare them
the hell away.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.569
The only one
that wasn't afraid of
that animal was Luke.

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.639
He fed him,

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:44.708
took care of him.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:49.346
He had a lot
of courage.

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:51.115
What about you?

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.251
(CHUCKLES)
I didn't need any.
I had Luke.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:57.821
Oh, this is our island.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.724
The only place
Dad ever really owned.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.627
At the time
this was taken,
it was worthless.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:06.196
Not to Luke, though.

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:09.933
To him,
it was the most precious
place in the world.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.602
When he was older,
he went to Vietnam.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:15.539
He came back a hero.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:18.175
He swore he'd
never leave it again.

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:20.710
He didn't.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.818
What happened?

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:31.388
My mother got the island
in the divorce settlement.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:35.625
She immediately sold it
to the government
for a lot of money.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:38.428
They wanted to
put up a power plant.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.165
Luke went crazy.
He made some threats.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.500
The government laughed.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:46.070
He blew up
a construction site.

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:48.605
They quit laughing.

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:51.641
And then?

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.946
He went on waging
his own private war.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.448
Hurt some people.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.617
Savannah and I
tried to stop him,

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.186
but the government
stopped him first.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:06.290
Shot him in the head. Bingo.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.859
Would you like
a cold drink?
Maybe a beer, huh?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.098
How did you deal
with his death?

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.433
Shut down
like a broken motor.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.836
Hmm. And according
to the Southern way,
still no tears?

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:21.771
(LAUGHING)

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.108
Oh, I cry sometimes,
Lowenstein.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.009
I cry at weddings,
at the Olympics.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:29.045
I'm real big
at the national anthem.
But not over Luke?

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.782
What the hell for?
It wouldn't bring
him back.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:37.321
No. But it might
bring you back.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.428
(SIGHS)

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:57.341
Thank you.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.722
Hey, there.
Welcome back.
Hi.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:15.091
Oh, gee. Dr. Wingo
had an emergency
down at the hospital.

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:17.560
Aw, that's all right,
Megan.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.895
Are the girls asleep?
Uh, yes, sir,
for a while now.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.531
All right.
You go home now.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.200
Okay, I'll just
get my things.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:46.622
Hey, Coach.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.457
Oh, hey, Sally.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:53.029
How you doing?
All right. Fine.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:59.435
What's the proper form
in a situation like this?

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.104
Do we talk or do we fight
or do we ignore the whole
thing all together?

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.408
I don't...
I don't know.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.843
You want some juice?
Yeah.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.749
(SIGHS)
SALLY: How's Savannah, Tom?

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:15.952
She... She's one day up,
and one day down.

01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:18.854
Do you, uh,
like the psychiatrist,
do you trust her?

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.325
Oh, yeah.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.926
Well, what's...
What's her name again?

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.696
Lowenstein.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.631
Do you want me
to make a fire?

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.935
I don't think so.
It's 90 degrees outside.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.673
You've always been
such a traditionalist.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.042
Jack Cleveland wants
to marry me, Tom.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:46.883
Do you need a letter
of recommendation?

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:49.386
That's not funny.

01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:51.388
Well, uh, considering
my other options,

01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:55.091
I thought it was the kindest,
most restrained thing
I could say.

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.997
What do you want do?

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:02.966
I don't know.

(SIGHS)

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:12.008
I mean, part of me
just wants to pack up
and walk away from a life

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:14.378
that doesn't
seem to work anymore.

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.951
And part of me
says that no life
will work,

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:24.921
if I can't make
this one right.

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:30.694
How can I
help you, Sally?

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.300
By trying to understand,
I guess.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.436
Sally,

01:10:39.503 --> 01:10:42.306
I'm sorry I made you
unsure of yourself.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.743
I can be a closed,
defensive son of a bitch.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.646
Sometimes.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.018
Only sometimes.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.067
Are you coming in?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.272
I'll... I'll sleep here.

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:21.845
(STAMMERING)
It'd be too confusing.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.081
Yeah.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.518
Sally?

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:29.853
Yeah.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.657
Thanks for asking, though.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.208
Daddy's home!

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.743
Yeah!

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:57.313
Daddy?

01:11:57.381 --> 01:12:00.984
Daddy?
Where are you, Daddy?

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:03.086
Dad?
Hey, Daddy.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.954
(GROANING)

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:07.724
Who are these
screaming piglets
jumping on my chest?

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:09.459
Oh, boy, am I hungry.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:11.595
A little mustard
and hot sauce, and
you would be perfect.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.830
You can't catch me.
CHANDLER: You can't
catch me either.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:15.532
TOM: All right.
Who missed me most?

01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:18.034
Careful now,
there's money involved.
Me. Me.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:20.504
Get your deck shoes on.
We're going out on Grandpa's
shrimp boat later.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.472
LUCY: Oh, good.
We're gonna see Grandpa.

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.708
Hi, Jenny. You like
that sweater I got you?
Yeah, it's nice, Dad.

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:26.376
Good.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.380
Dad?
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:32.649 --> 01:12:35.051
Are you and Mom having
a bad fight or something?

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.288
No, honey.
Everything's fine.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.324
Y'all don't fool me.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.699
Oh, boy.

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:56.005
What am I gonna do
with all of you
smart women?

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.744
Hmm? Come here.
Give me a hug.

01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:06.082
Oh, Jenny.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:09.653
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.991
Chandler, come on in
if you want to help.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.526
You too, Tom.

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.928
Mommy,
I got a fishing rod
from Grandpa.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.699
It's beautiful. Well, maybe
this one's a little crooked.
Come here, Daddy. Come here.

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.668
JENNY: Lucy did that one.
LUCY: I did not.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.904
Oh, you did, too.
CHANDLER:
I want to decorate.

01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:29.706
Of course you can decorate.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.875
That's... It's your cake.
You go on and decorate.

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.843
You stop eating
that icing, you.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.212
CHANDLER: I want to do one.
Well, okay.
But why don't you do two?

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.615
LILA: Henry.
Come to the table.

01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:41.951
The children are gonna
blow out their candles.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.253
Henry?
MAN ON TV: It may be
a factor, it may not.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.523
Do you hear me?

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:49.392
It's time to sing
Happy Birthday
to Tom and Savannah.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:52.428
HENRY: I'm watching TV.
MAN ON TV: It's a fly ball,
out to right field.

01:13:52.496 --> 01:13:54.864
You get over there,
and help your children
celebrate their birthday,

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.600
for Christ's sake.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.537
Come here, woman. Don't you
ever tell me what to do, Lila.
Let me go.

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:03.039
You're hurting me.
This is my house.
You're just a guest in it.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.774
Now turn that
TV back on.

01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:07.043
No.
YOUNG SAVANNAH: Please, Mommy.
It's all right.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.978
Turn the TV back on.
LILA: Let go of me.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.180
HENRY: You go turn
that thing back on.
I was watching it.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:12.348
Do what Daddy
says, Mama.

01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.584
(SCREAMING)
Lila, I'm sick and...

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:17.521
Sick and tired of you
never showing me
any respect!

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.055
(GUN FIRES)

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.390
LUKE: TV's broken,
you son of a bitch.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.227
Now you can
watch your kids
blow out their candles.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:28.632
ALL: Yeah!

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.200
* Happy birthday to you
* Happy birthday to me

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:34.604
* Happy birthday to you
* Happy birthday to me

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:39.142
* Happy birthday,
dear Chandler
* Happy birthday, dear me

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.612
* Happy birthday to you
* Happy birthday to me

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:44.781
(ALL CHEERING)

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.918
CHANDLER: Come on, Grandpa.
Daddy's gonna open the net.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.020
HENRY: I'm a-coming,
birthday girl.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.022
TOM: Come on.
Bring it up.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:55.959
Bring it up.
Grandpa, I brought the
fishing rod you brought me.

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:57.794
TOM: Hold it.
Okay, okay.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:15:00.096
JENNY: It smells.
HENRY: Stand back,
he's getting ready to drop it.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.898
CHANDLER: Daddy, can I help?
Wait, wait. Wait.

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:04.768
LUCY: Oh, hurry up, Daddy.
Dad, I don't know if we
got much shrimp here.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.036
CHILDREN: Oh.
Look at that.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:11.675
HENRY: The first thing
you want to do is push
these crabs overboard.

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:12.942
Why, Grandpa?

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:16.479
They'll die in the sun
and the heat.

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:19.148
Keep your eye out for
stingrays and catfish.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.785
It's a long way
to the hospital.
I want that little squiggly.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.587
Chandler.
CHANDLER:
What, Grandpa?

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:26.255
I want you to do
something for me.

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.825
Pick up a shrimp
and I want to see you
head it.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:32.495
Oh, I can do that.
Now, you put it
with your thumb.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:35.965
Is this right, Grandpa?
Remember how... See if you
can do it with one hand.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.968
Yeah.
You got a knack
for this, huh?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.536
Look.

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:42.205
Fetch me that crate
over there, will you,

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.107
for this good-for-nothing,
trash fish.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.709
JENNY: Grandpa told me
to get it.

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.143
LUCY: No he didn't,
he told me.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.678
CHANDLER: I'm gonna get it.

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:53.850
They love you, Dad.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.861
The Braves lost
to the Dodgers last night,
three to seven.

01:16:09.532 --> 01:16:11.601
Did you know that, Son?

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.673
Yeah, I know that, Dad.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:20.443
(GIRLS CHATTERING)

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.811
Put it right
down there.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:23.312
CHANDLER: Can I be a shrimper
when I grow up, Grandpa?

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:26.415
Yeah, you can be
a shrimper like me.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:34.590
Take good care of them.
Bye-bye, girls. I love you.

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:36.092
Bye, Daddy.
All right.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.526
Write.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.162
How will you get
to the airport?

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.330
Don't worry.
I'll get a cab.

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.734
Bye-bye.
Bye, Dad.

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:51.808
TOM: You know,
I never realized how
much I love this place,

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:53.910
till I went away.

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:55.578
(SIGHS)

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:58.181
"My soul grazes
like a lamb

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:01.617
"on the beauty
of indrawn tides."

01:17:01.685 --> 01:17:04.754
You remember that?
You wrote that to me
in a letter once.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:07.724
I used to write
damn good letters,
didn't I?

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:12.461
You've met somebody
in New York, haven't you?

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:17.801
I don't know.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.737
I know.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.638
Now, you are gonna do
like I said.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.606
You are gonna apologize
to the Newburys.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.642
Todd Newbury
insulted our family, Mama.

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:01.410
He called us
"cheap, white trash."

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:04.313
And then you proved him
right by whaling him,
you stupid cracker.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.220
Oh.

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:14.290
Oh, isn't this
a lovely view?
I wanna go home.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.325
Hush up.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.929
Hello, Tom.

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:23.432
Hello, Reese.
I'm here to see
my mother.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.969
Well, come on in.
She's expecting you.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:30.239
Why, thank you.
It is awful good of you
to see us, Reese.

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:32.075
Well, it's my pleasure.

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:34.610
You're looking
mighty pretty today,
Lila, as usual.

01:18:34.677 --> 01:18:38.614
Why, I always say,
the most successful men
are always the nicest.

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:40.249
(CHUCKLING)

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.318
Lila, if you'll just have
a seat right here,
Why, sure.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:45.121
Tom and I are gonna have
a little talk in my study.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:52.561
(WHISPERING) Tom.

01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:55.999
It's an oriental carpet.

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.635
From the orient.

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:13.549
If you ever touch
my son again,

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:17.686
you're gonna be
crab bait all over
this river, boy.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.690
A Wingo never
touches a Newbury.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.927
And if you tell anybody
I hit you,

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:27.196
I'm gonna run your family
clean out of this town.

01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:29.933
Now, get out of here.

01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:35.471
TOM: I think it's more humid
than in New York City.

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:37.473
Hello, darling.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.608
Tom.
Hello, Lila.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.646
Wealth becomes you, Mama.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.852
You really got
what you wanted,
didn't you?

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:51.855
Don't start, please.

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:55.524
Tell me about Savannah.

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:58.427
She still has
a long way to go.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:01.564
And I cut out
a whole slew of articles
on mental illness.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.433
I want you to give them
to her psychiatrist,
do you hear?

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.602
I will, Lila. I will.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.708
What kinds of things
are you telling
Savannah's doctor?

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:14.477
Anything that might
help her get better.

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:21.784
Go on. Drink your tea
before the ice melts.

01:20:21.851 --> 01:20:24.787
I'm gonna tell
Dr. Lowenstein
about Callanwolde.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.693
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:32.361
Oh, yeah, you do, Mama.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:34.063
Yeah, you do.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.036
We made a promise
never to speak
about that.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:42.671
I expect you to
keep that promise.

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:45.741
Oh, we were kids, Mama.
It was a stupid promise.

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.843
I think it would
help all of us
if we talked about it.

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:51.214
This is my life, too.
My life is private.
I wanna keep it private.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.482
Even at the expense
of helping your
own daughter?

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:55.451
Stop exaggerating.
Oh, come on, Mama.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.153
Don't make me
feel bad about this.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.587
You know,
I didn't even
have to tell you.

01:20:58.654 --> 01:20:59.923
I don't wanna
talk about it...

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:02.225
Jesus Christ, Lila.
Now, that's always
been the problem.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:03.993
You know what
your problem is?

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.995
You dwell too much
on the past.

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:07.830
I never look back.

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:09.598
When I say goodbye
to something,
I close the door,

think about it again.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.937
How about Luke?

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:16.039
What?

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:19.675
Do you ever
think about Luke?

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:29.919
Does he ever
cross your mind?

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.328
Who taught you
to be so cruel?

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.499
You did, Mama.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.969
You did.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:59.348
But you also taught me
that even though someone
nearly destroys your life,

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.251
you can still
feel love for them.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:09.625
Is that supposed to warm
a mother's heart?

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:17.266
You'll have to
be patient with me, Lila.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.502
You've done a lot
to piss me off.

noise in New York.

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:46.762

to tell you.

I remember having fun.

Of course you can.

the answer to all of
Savannah's problems,

you should know.

Told us the minute
we breathed a word
about it,

01:30:23.686 --> 01:30:26.922
was the minute
she stopped being
our mother.

would come

look nicer in the sunlight.

buried the bodies,

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.936
I went in
to check on Savannah.

what Mama had said,

as if nothing
had happened.

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:15.904
Okay.

01:36:15.971 --> 01:36:18.640
I had no idea
he was so strong.

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:20.642
He's a good
football player.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:24.012
But I'm not sure
I want him playing the violin
with broken fingers.

01:36:24.079 --> 01:36:26.714
Well, he said you'd
be worried about that.
He's pretty careful.

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.683
He's the one
who should be worried.

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:30.185
Well...

I'm sorry to cut your
session short, Mr. Wingo,

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:36.424
but I've enrolled Bernard
in the last two weeks
at Tanglewood.

01:36:36.491 --> 01:36:40.695
With a little discipline,
he might actually become
a good musician.

I put you through all this.
Oh, no, no, no.

You did me a favor.

01:38:24.199 --> 01:38:26.201
But just don't
do it again.

of a world without
you in it, sweetheart.

I dished out,

and you came back
asking for more.

coach I ever had.

you ever had.

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:19.387

be doing something
better with my life.

I don't know if
they'd even want me.

01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:30.798
Well, maybe I could write
a letter or something.

01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:32.767
I mean, just tell me
where to send it.

01:39:32.834 --> 01:39:35.003

But I want you to do
something else for me.

01:48:08.883 --> 01:48:10.752
Yo!

01:48:11.586 --> 01:48:13.621
Tom.

01:48:14.789 --> 01:48:16.858
Tom, wait!

01:48:21.295 --> 01:48:23.998
Now I know
why you always
seem so sad.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:30.605
Please, take me with you.

01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.570
Let me warn you.

01:49:02.637 --> 01:49:05.573
The thought of falling
in love terrifies me.

01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:11.879
Then let's
just be friends.

01:49:11.946 --> 01:49:13.981
Very good friends.

01:50:10.805 --> 01:50:13.741
Lowenstein.
Hmm?

01:50:17.712 --> 01:50:19.613
I think
I like adultery.

01:50:19.681 --> 01:50:21.448
(CHUCKLING)

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:25.286
That's why
they made it a sin.

01:50:34.195 --> 01:50:39.734
Repent sinners.
Cast your lot
with the Lord.

01:50:39.801 --> 01:50:41.969
After last night,
I'm gonna need
some repenting.

01:50:42.036 --> 01:50:45.106
Oh, I'm in trouble.
What? What?

01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:47.742
Tell me.
Why are you
in trouble?

01:50:47.809 --> 01:50:50.544
I'm starting to like
this city, Doctor.

01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:53.014
(DOORBELL RINGS)
What made you
change your mind?

01:50:55.116 --> 01:50:56.183
You have to ask?

01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:58.385
I'm neurotic.
I need a lot
of reassurance.

01:50:58.452 --> 01:51:01.522
Lowenstein, you could
make me change my mind
about anything.

01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:05.893
Hi, Tom.
Hot baked goods.

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.829
Did I interrupt
something vile?

01:51:08.763 --> 01:51:10.364
Well, hello, Susan.

01:51:10.431 --> 01:51:12.700
You look fabulous
this morning.

01:51:12.767 --> 01:51:15.069
I'm so glad
you both got laid.

01:51:15.136 --> 01:51:16.637
Hi, Eddie.

01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:19.606
Would you
like a little butter on
your croissant, darling?

01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:21.408
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:51:22.243 --> 01:51:23.778
Ask him.

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:31.753
LOWENSTEIN:
Guess what?

01:51:31.819 --> 01:51:34.756
I spoke to Bernard today
and he asked me to come
visit him next weekend.

01:51:34.822 --> 01:51:37.792
I couldn't believe it.
TOM: That's great.
That's fantastic.

01:51:37.859 --> 01:51:39.927
I'm so grateful to you,
Tom Wingo.

01:51:39.994 --> 01:51:42.930
Oh, it was nothing.
Nothing. Come on.
Cut it out.

01:51:42.997 --> 01:51:46.868
Look, this is the property.
It goes all the way around.
All the way over to there.

01:51:46.934 --> 01:51:50.137
Isn't it beautiful?
Not as beautiful as you.

01:51:50.204 --> 01:51:52.273
Oh, sweetheart.

01:51:52.339 --> 01:51:54.175
This is it. Herbert
never liked it, you know.

01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:56.477
It made him sneeze,
this place.

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:57.979
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:51:58.045 --> 01:52:00.882
I miss
the clean, fresh smell
of carbon monoxide myself.

01:52:00.948 --> 01:52:03.550
I can't believe
we're only an hour
away from New York.

01:52:03.617 --> 01:52:06.487
Well, South Carolina's not
the only state with trees,
you know.

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:09.290
You know,
in my next life, I want
to be you, Lowenstein.

01:52:09.356 --> 01:52:11.392
I want to make
lots of money off
of crazy people

01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:13.227
and have a fabulous
penthouse in the city,

01:52:13.294 --> 01:52:14.896
a great country house,

01:52:14.962 --> 01:52:17.431
and a guy like me.
Aw.

01:52:20.634 --> 01:52:22.770
Come on. I want
to show you around.
All right.

01:52:24.772 --> 01:52:26.774
Look, isn't it pretty?

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:32.046
Darling, you just
broke a dozen eggs.
Oh, I don't care.

01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:37.384
You know what I thought
when I first saw you?

01:52:37.451 --> 01:52:41.055
What?
I thought, "Jesus,
she hates me.

01:52:41.122 --> 01:52:44.491
"Why does she make me
feel so damn stupid?"

01:52:44.558 --> 01:52:45.759
What do you
think now?

01:52:45.827 --> 01:52:47.661
Right now?
Mmm-hmm.

01:52:47.728 --> 01:52:52.333
I'm thinking,
"Why does she make me
feel so damn good?"

01:52:52.399 --> 01:52:54.068
Because she loves you.

01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:05.612
(MOANING)

01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:12.286
Oh. Lowenstein,
Lowenstein.

01:53:15.356 --> 01:53:18.625
Maybe I should
be calling you
Susan now.

01:53:20.294 --> 01:53:22.063
I love the way
you say "Lowenstein."

01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:24.265
Oh.

01:53:24.331 --> 01:53:26.233
You know,

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.803
before I met you,
I was in a deep sleep.

01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:32.239
And I didn't
even know it.

01:53:37.511 --> 01:53:39.346
I'm afraid.

01:53:40.614 --> 01:53:43.784
Of what, sweetheart?

01:53:43.851 --> 01:53:47.054
Of what's gonna happen
when Sally wants you back.

01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:50.925
(SIGHS)

01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:55.762
She wants you back,
you know.

01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:59.166
What makes you
so sure?

01:53:59.233 --> 01:54:01.102
I've sampled
the merchandise.

01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:05.306
Oh, my God.

01:54:11.812 --> 01:54:13.314
TOM: Spread 'em wide.
Spread...

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:14.781
LOWENSTEIN:
You dirty thing, you.

01:54:14.848 --> 01:54:16.850
No, I'm not being dirty.
Spread 'em this way.

01:54:16.918 --> 01:54:18.519
Now, you gotta tackle me.

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:21.855
(LAUGHING)
Go on. Tackle.

01:54:21.923 --> 01:54:24.158
Catch it.
Oh, Jesus.

01:54:24.225 --> 01:54:26.127
Ready. Let's go.

01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:32.133

01:54:32.199 --> 01:54:33.767
(SHOUTING)

01:54:35.102 --> 01:54:38.205
I'm too old
for this game.
Me, too.

01:54:38.272 --> 01:54:40.041
This is
the best part.
Yeah.

01:54:42.243 --> 01:54:45.079
If we stay together,
do I have to become Jewish?

01:54:45.146 --> 01:54:47.348
Of course not.
Herbert's not Jewish.

01:54:47.414 --> 01:54:50.451
Hey, I don't mind.
Everybody in my family
is doing it.

01:55:05.766 --> 01:55:08.202
There's Luke
up there, somewhere.

01:55:11.005 --> 01:55:13.640
You stupid asshole!

01:55:18.612 --> 01:55:22.216
When I was a kid,
he seemed like
a God to me.

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:26.853
How do you
see him now?

01:55:29.156 --> 01:55:31.358
Like a man,

01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:34.395
with limitations
like the rest of us.

01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:37.564
Except for you, Lowenstein.
You're perfect.

01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:40.401
I am far from it.
No.

01:55:40.467 --> 01:55:45.006
Oh, I look back on my life
and I realize that I've
been paralyzed

01:55:45.072 --> 01:55:49.977
for the last...
God knows how
many years.

01:55:50.044 --> 01:55:52.579
I mean,
how could I have stayed
in a marriage like that?

01:55:52.646 --> 01:55:54.415
Well, you had a son.

01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:57.651
Oh, yeah.
There were reasons,

01:55:57.718 --> 01:56:00.154
but none of them
were good enough.

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:03.357
I just...

01:56:03.424 --> 01:56:08.295
I just never thought
that this was possible.

01:56:10.264 --> 01:56:12.566
And now,

01:56:12.633 --> 01:56:15.369
I wake up
in the morning,

01:56:15.436 --> 01:56:21.408
and I spend my whole day
thinking, "Isn't it nice
just to feel good?"

01:56:21.475 --> 01:56:23.910
I mean, I hear you walk
down the hall towards me.

01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:30.484
I can't stop smiling.

01:56:32.286 --> 01:56:34.755
I smile all the time.

01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:46.400
I love you, Lowenstein.

01:56:50.204 --> 01:56:53.440
Can we go back
to the cabin and
make love all night?

01:56:58.179 --> 01:57:01.148
You still have
a lot to learn
about the outdoors.

01:57:47.694 --> 01:57:50.864
SAVANNAH: I'm glad you
brought me here.

01:57:50.931 --> 01:57:53.767
Hey, Lowenstein says
she's gonna let you
go home soon.

01:57:53.834 --> 01:57:56.503
Hmm.
I think I'm ready.

01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:59.406
What about you?
When are you going home?

01:58:01.942 --> 01:58:04.478
Well, I don't know.
Sally and I are
having problems.

01:58:04.545 --> 01:58:06.813
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Tom.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.015
I thought I might
stay up here
for a while.

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:12.186
You in New York?
I can't imagine that.

01:58:12.253 --> 01:58:14.054
You could never
leave the South.

01:58:14.121 --> 01:58:18.692
Well, you did.
Yeah, but I don't
love it the way you do.

We knew this day
would come, didn't we?

But you're never quite
prepared for it.

you're the kind of guy

to his family.

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:35.055
Oh.

Good.

I started a new
book of poems.
Oh, good.

I'm calling it
the Prince of Tides,

02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:25.071
and I dedicated it
to somebody very special.

02:02:25.138 --> 02:02:28.542
Luke would
appreciate that, Savannah.

02:02:28.609 --> 02:02:31.712
I dedicated it
to my brother,

Oh, thank you.

(SAXOPHONE PLAYING)

02:03:13.754 --> 02:03:16.590
Lowenstein, why are you
making this so hard?

02:03:24.798 --> 02:03:26.667
You just love her more.

02:03:27.601 --> 02:03:29.202
Admit it.

02:03:32.739 --> 02:03:34.841
No, Lowenstein.

02:03:34.908 --> 02:03:36.810
Just longer.

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.370
TOM: We spent our
last few hours together
at the Rainbow Room,

02:04:07.073 --> 02:04:09.576
dancing a slow dance.

02:04:11.945 --> 02:04:14.180
Just like in my dream.

02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:20.320
I held her in my arms,

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:24.958
as I told her
it was her doing
that I could go back.

02:04:26.493 --> 02:04:27.828
Six weeks before,

02:04:27.894 --> 02:04:31.164
I was ready to
leave my wife, my kids.

02:04:32.232 --> 02:04:34.367
I wanted out of everything.

02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:39.773
But she changed that.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:42.676
She changed me.

02:04:42.743 --> 02:04:44.277
For the first time,
I felt like

02:04:44.344 --> 02:04:47.848
I had something to give back
to the women in my life.

02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:52.218
They deserved that.

02:05:09.736 --> 02:05:11.304
CHANDLER: Daddy!

02:05:11.371 --> 02:05:14.040
LUCY: Daddy's home.

02:05:14.107 --> 02:05:16.142
CHANDLER: Daddy, did you
bring me anything?

02:05:16.209 --> 02:05:20.280
TOM: So I returned
to my Southern home
and my Southern life.

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:24.751
And it is in the presence
of my wife and children
that I acknowledge my life,

02:05:24.818 --> 02:05:26.486
my destiny.

02:05:27.487 --> 02:05:30.891
I am a teacher, a coach

02:05:30.957 --> 02:05:33.426
and a well-loved man,

02:05:33.493 --> 02:05:37.998
and it is more than enough.

02:05:38.064 --> 02:05:41.334
In New York,
I learned that I needed to
love my mother and father

02:05:41.401 --> 02:05:45.572
in all their flawed,
outrageous humanity.

02:05:45.639 --> 02:05:51.077
And in families,
there are no crimes
beyond forgiveness.

02:05:51.144 --> 02:05:55.315
But it is
the mystery of life
that sustains me now.

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:59.319
And I look to the north,

02:06:01.087 --> 02:06:05.458
and I wish again that
there were two lives
apportioned to every man

02:06:06.026 --> 02:06:08.028
and every woman.

02:06:10.230 --> 02:06:11.598
At the end of every day,

02:06:11.665 --> 02:06:14.701
I drive through the
city of Charleston.

02:06:14.768 --> 02:06:18.772
And as I cross the bridge
that'll take me home,

02:06:18.839 --> 02:06:23.409
I feel the words
building inside me.

02:06:23.476 --> 02:06:26.713
I can't stop them
or tell you why
I say them.

02:06:28.081 --> 02:06:31.718
But as I reach
the top of the bridge,

02:06:31.785 --> 02:06:34.387
these words come to me
in a whisper.

02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:38.291
I say them as prayer,

02:06:38.358 --> 02:06:40.927
as regret,

02:06:40.994 --> 02:06:43.029
as praise.

02:06:43.096 --> 02:06:45.465
I say,

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:47.801
"Lowenstein.

02:06:47.868 --> 02:06:50.170
"Lowenstein."
