the first to recognize

21:45.882 --> 21:47.331
as profitable
may be the company

21:47.336 --> 21:48.485
if we forget
ourselves

21:48.490 --> 21:50.138

27:11.919 --> 27:15.119
George. I was at level five.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.620
I was a king.

27:16.721 --> 27:18.921
A king among men.

27:19.322 --> 27:21.922
And one day, I was in my
office and fell asleep.

27:22.023 --> 27:25.923
And I was walking.

27:25.924 --> 27:29.424
He was sleeping, but I
Walked down the road

27:29.425 --> 27:32.425
and people laughed at me.

27:32.426 --> 27:33.926
and when I looked down

27:34.127 --> 27:38.927
I saw that I was missing the penis.

27:38.928 --> 27:40.728
And in its place was
logo of Jeffers.

27:41.229 --> 27:45.129
I do not care to try
remove it, it

27:45.130 --> 27:47.730
he fall to wash it.

27:50.131 --> 27:52.531
Then I realized that
had to flee

27:54.432 --> 27:57.932
before the explosion
caught it all.

27:58.933 --> 28:03.933
- I was in South America,
I lived in Ecuador.

28:03.934 --> 28:06.934
Then one night

28:07.035 --> 28:12.935
after drinking too much beer
maize and guinea pig

28:13.136 --> 28:16.936
I found myself free.

28:17.137 --> 28:18.937
Like when I was young.

28:18.938 --> 28:22.638
Only louder.

28:23.239 --> 28:27.939
And I knew that when he came to
house was capable of doing something.

28:28.340 --> 28:32.940
George, I came home
to live with our family.

28:34.441 --> 28:37.241
Came home

28:38.042 --> 28:40.242
Came home

28:40.343 --> 28:42.743
to live

28:43.744 --> 28:45.744
in the pool house.

28:46.345 --> 28:48.145
To find the force.

28:48.146 --> 28:50.446
And with the hope
to find it.

28:56.847 --> 28:59.447
I know, my brother, I know.

29:17.879 --> 29:22.027
"Keep phones
playing. I like this sound.

29:23.029 --> 29:27.629
People know, as I appreciate it!

29:27.630 --> 29:32.930
When I said I would do a marathon
to increase awareness

29:32.931 --> 29:36.231
all these explosions
that has been happening

29:36.232 --> 29:38.932

You're a fool.

29:49.935 --> 29:54.335
No one will want

29:54.636 --> 29:56.836
But I think

they were wrong!

30:00.638 --> 30:05.838
We checked

Now, Joe is with us.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.940
Yes, Joe!

30:12.141 --> 30:15.841
Joe wanted to walk again.

30:15.842 --> 30:16.842
His psychiatrist

30:16.843 --> 30:21.843
said he would live only
two weeks before it exploded.

30:22.144 --> 30:25.044
But thanks to hard work

30:25.145 --> 30:27.745

beauty of this position

36:02.958 --> 36:05.658
Just calm down.
Relax.

36:05.659 --> 36:07.159
This is a friend.

36:07.260 --> 36:10.160

36:14.161 --> 36:16.161
It feels like work?
We are well, tiger?

36:19.762 --> 36:22.162
The doctor still thinks
will you explode?

36:22.163 --> 36:25.663
Well Well This means that
treatment is working.

36:26.264 --> 36:30.664
Remove the cream in dermatological
softening and exfoliating.

36:31.665 --> 36:33.665
Sleep well?

36:35.166 --> 36:37.666

36:38.667 --> 36:40.667
What about sex?

36:41.068 --> 36:43.668

37:11.075 --> 37:13.275

37:13.976 --> 37:16.676
Know what
M.E.R.D.A. means?

37:16.777 --> 37:18.677
M.E.R.D.A. means

37:18.678 --> 37:20.578
someone
not feel lucky

37:20.679 --> 37:23.179

great country

37:24.180 --> 37:27.180

difference for us.

37:27.181 --> 37:30.381
Who do not have any luck
work for Jeffers coorporaзгo.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.382
Sort of having a woman

37:33.383 --> 37:35.583

give you a little advice

38:39.001 --> 38:41.701
to close this session.

38:46.102 --> 38:50.902
It is quite natural desire
sex, George.

38:50.903 --> 38:53.503
The man who does not want sex

38:53.504 --> 38:55.504
is a man who does not believe
the world you live.

38:55.505 --> 38:57.505
He does not believe in the future.

38:58.806 --> 39:02.506
A man who does not want sex
is a man without hope.

39:03.907 --> 39:05.507
Without faith.

39:07.508 --> 39:10.508
A man without sex is ...

39:10.509 --> 39:16.509
He is not a man Complect.
He is not a man Complect, George.

39:17.310 --> 39:19.510
Is.

39:23.911 --> 39:25.011

41:01.624 --> 41:03.024

41:11.325 --> 41:15.025
Outer space is empty

41:15.026 --> 41:18.026
As your life is
empty and meaningless.

46:23.919 --> 46:24.319

46:24.320 --> 46:26.020
There are two possible

The Big Boss was maintained.

48:20.066 --> 48:23.666
A race to happiness

50:25.698 --> 50:28.998

50:46.099 --> 50:50.999

56:51.713 --> 56:56.149

56:56.150 --> 56:58.818
Perhaps a more sophisticated site.

56:59.323 --> 57:02.019
Something suitable for a
goop level 4.

01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:17.098
And in accordance with
the president's agenda,

01:01:17.419 --> 01:01:19.102
advert to my own initiative.

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:22.709
An official of the corporation
Jeffers demonstrating behaviors

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:27.212
explosives or potentially problematic --
ticos will be expelled immediately. "

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:32.501
"The right to information
the underdeveloped areas. "

01:01:33.866 --> 01:01:39.539
I can not wait to see
the vision of our leader

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.286
on an explosive life and freedom. "

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.546
"Happiness is being happy.

01:02:19.646 --> 01:02:24.297
"Happiness is to be happy?"

01:02:25.722 --> 01:02:28.775
"What the hell, how
I do this? "

01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:30.813
This is nonsense.

01:02:31.199 --> 01:02:34.419
"I, Agena. So much butter."

01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:37.411
...

01:02:37.511 --> 01:02:41.036
"Happiness is to be happy?"

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:44.551
"That crazy as this?"

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:49.701
"What the devil ..."

01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:33.491
Task number 800 with butter.

01:03:57.016 --> 01:04:00.550
Care.
Care.

01:04:26.087 --> 01:04:28.531
Want to sit?

01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:37.710
The FBI is in the forest.

01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:40.112
I think it will make a
incursion here.

01:04:45.777 --> 01:04:50.141
They have been coming.

01:04:50.203 --> 01:04:53.684
Since the president made
a notice of the inhibitors

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:56.599
someone spread the word
there was a party

01:04:58.156 --> 01:05:00.709
or revolution taking place here.

01:05:02.152 --> 01:05:04.139
It is the policy.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.609
At least I have
the right to name it.

01:05:10.592 --> 01:05:14.428
Even without know are
to do the same as the others.

01:05:14.863 --> 01:05:16.948
Only with a different name.

01:05:18.676 --> 01:05:20.961
Entertain.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:26.566
Losing lying.

01:05:29.457 --> 01:05:36.542
Nobody cares
the defect, or dreams.

01:05:55.883 --> 01:05:57.702
He used them as models.

01:05:58.258 --> 01:06:00.674
You know, the toy soldiers.

01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:06.683
I did a re -
When Washington crossed the Delaware.

01:06:06.684 --> 01:06:13.610
The night of the passage, Washington
had a vision.

01:06:16.218 --> 01:06:18.459
The other night I had this dream.

01:06:19.638 --> 01:06:23.240
I was in your store а
night, before I cross

01:06:25.599 --> 01:06:28.704
appeared a woman,
whom he worked.

01:06:30.229 --> 01:06:36.558
And try to show me something.

01:06:38.019 --> 01:06:40.135
And the next day I went to see it.

01:06:41.071 --> 01:06:43.682
There was a time
the restaurant

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:48.999
hands
were near the mine.

01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:50.506
And I thought

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.680
would play into the hands

01:06:57.227 --> 01:06:59.301
How to get a

01:07:00.623 --> 01:07:02.886
pool of deep water.

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.799
She is the woman with whom I worked.

01:07:07.558 --> 01:07:09.204
At four goop.

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:15.139
But when she said she felt.

01:07:18.824 --> 01:07:20.384
Well, I know.

01:07:22.343 --> 01:07:24.980
I'm not sure if
she has not touched his hand.

01:07:26.173 --> 01:07:29.201
And if there was some promise
in the dream, I did not.

01:07:29.582 --> 01:07:31.999
I saw it, but saw nothing more.

01:08:00.485 --> 01:08:02.054
"See, with the
recently developed inhibitor

01:08:02.154 --> 01:08:04.396
eliminates all
thought, pain or emotion

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:05.364
to take it to farms --

01:08:05.464 --> 01:08:07.596
Joe Ryder!

01:08:07.642 --> 01:08:10.145
Oh, George! How could
thought I could beat us?

01:08:10.245 --> 01:08:11.610
I bleed!

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:14.762
Did not I tell?
Dreams are not real.

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:16.020
I never wanted

01:08:17.249 --> 01:08:19.828
Inhibitors Jeffers ...
comes in three great colors:

01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:23.886
orange, blue and red.

01:08:23.928 --> 01:08:27.049
In my dream,
 waves me to a place.

01:08:27.613 --> 01:08:29.165
The use of new inhibitors.

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:33.163
Sorry
I should not say that.

01:08:33.225 --> 01:08:35.292
It does not matter.

01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:41.727
I thought if I came here,
show me.

01:08:44.068 --> 01:08:47.321
Well, what you see?

01:08:53.268 --> 01:08:57.395
George. George.

01:08:59.429 --> 01:09:01.002
Where you going?

It is a level 5.

01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.152
Hey. Hold on.

01:10:21.628 --> 01:10:25.048
Hold on! I bought this chair.

01:10:41.489 --> 01:10:43.148
"Please draw a
his vision of the future. "

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.004
Hey George!

01:10:49.755 --> 01:10:51.078
Hey!

01:10:53.276 --> 01:10:57.498
Need 1 776 minutes of productivity

01:10:57.598 --> 01:10:59.967
for the weekend.

01:11:00.468 --> 01:11:05.860
"News 1440 AM, bad news
my soul mate

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.689
from tomorrow AM 1440

01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:11.724
will stop playing music.

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:14.454
The producers asked me
to read as follows:

01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:17.498
The president raised
the risk of explosion

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:19.362
from dark brown to magenta.

01:11:19.495 --> 01:11:25.632
We do not want someone explode
in underdeveloped areas

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:30.254
where there are castles
Breaded old

01:11:30.843 --> 01:11:33.560
and women in bikinis.

01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:42.935
Howard!

01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:05.758
Of course we want our
women die as rats

01:12:05.778 --> 01:12:13.246
in the basement and our
men like wolves in the mountains.

01:13:13.004 --> 01:13:14.678
She's dead.

01:13:24.822 --> 01:13:30.128
He put the gun in his mouth,
apologized, pressed the trigger

01:13:30.219 --> 01:13:32.652
opened the brain.

01:13:35.631 --> 01:13:42.730
So I put the gun in my mouth,
I apologized and pressed the trigger.

01:13:44.137 --> 01:13:46.045
As in the book.

01:13:46.137 --> 01:13:48.474
Love ...
Shut up!

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:54.487
I've been sitting all
the afternoon trying to explode.

01:13:54.641 --> 01:13:58.575
But I can not. I can not
Do it because there is nothing in me.

01:13:58.634 --> 01:13:59.813
Nothing more.

01:14:00.358 --> 01:14:02.368
And I realized.
Nobody says

01:14:02.624 --> 01:14:05.201
people who are
explode are not sick

01:14:05.451 --> 01:14:07.566
are not cursed
or dangerous.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:08.837
They are better than us, because

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:12.177
I still feel something,
still dream of something.

01:14:12.497 --> 01:14:15.377
Something that does not go out
a haircut,

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:17.491
with coffee
milk, with this kind of ...

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:19.101
and then back
grow

01:14:19.348 --> 01:14:22.575
and a husband who did not return
can get an erection.

01:14:23.694 --> 01:14:29.336
See? Nothing.
There is nothing left.

01:14:47.543 --> 01:14:49.622
Damn. I lost it!

01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:51.946
Want to hear the worst?

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:55.160
The last time I felt
alive was the day we met.

01:14:55.426 --> 01:14:57.589
At this meeting, the meeting of 30.

01:14:57.872 --> 01:14:58.915
I was drunk.

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:01.867
I walked around drunk every day
this month.

01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:04.263
You know?

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:07.646
And it asks you to
your degree

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.091
and finger
mean on your shirt

01:15:10.115 --> 01:15:13.308
and talking about
George Washington Winsterhammerman.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.609
And I thought, because
did not return venture.

01:15:16.641 --> 01:15:19.708
So desperate sat
my room

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:23.543
with a gun in his hand
I wanted to kill me!

01:16:22.373 --> 01:16:24.564
I've been there long enough.

01:16:54.771 --> 01:16:57.389
George Washington Winsterhammerman?

01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.748
Level Three?

01:17:07.722 --> 01:17:09.660
It's amazing.

01:17:12.386 --> 01:17:14.986
I'm proud of the
My concentration

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:18.452
the ability
focus my mind

01:17:18.572 --> 01:17:22.804
and my body
in any subject

01:17:22.836 --> 01:17:26.780
without touching anything
without seeing or

01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:29.140
that is outside
my vision.

01:17:29.175 --> 01:17:31.603
Make sense?

01:17:31.742 --> 01:17:34.693
Now
I am looking for man

01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:37.430
Mr. Jeffers
saw a tunt.

01:17:37.613 --> 01:17:43.907
And I ...
I do not.

01:17:46.006 --> 01:17:47.335
And I worry, because

01:17:47.532 --> 01:17:50.871
there is a shit
war approaching, tunt.

01:17:51.008 --> 01:17:55.650
A war that will decide whether
Company Profile - Look at me!

01:17:55.896 --> 01:18:01.473
- Continue to follow the course
given by Mr. Jeffers

01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:06.361
or otherwise maneirao gives
resulted in a huge mess.

01:18:10.411 --> 01:18:12.500
So far we have
good looking men

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:14.359
to help us in this process.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.521
We have not thought much about you.

01:18:19.903 --> 01:18:21.805
We did not even
existed, but

01:18:23.647 --> 01:18:25.089
but then

01:18:27.642 --> 01:18:33.982
Gave us that.

01:18:46.828 --> 01:18:50.921
"Please draw a
image of his vision of the future. "

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.427
Mr. Jeffers
very much enjoyed this design.

01:19:02.485 --> 01:19:06.480
She is out there waiting Distributor.

01:19:25.042 --> 01:19:27.691
Pretty, is not it?

01:19:32.575 --> 01:19:35.174
Do not be afraid.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:39.378
My muscles are big.

01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:42.542
But only exercise I sweat.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.516
Want something?

01:19:49.029 --> 01:19:53.271
Soda? Alcohol?

01:19:56.994 --> 01:20:01.663
Normally I do not
I show my staff.

01:20:01.702 --> 01:20:07.216
In the past, had effects
negative impact on productivity.

01:20:07.311 --> 01:20:08.910
But times are changing.

01:20:09.165 --> 01:20:11.571
Now show me
my staff.

01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:13.063
Like now.

01:20:13.164 --> 01:20:15.502
Employees who I can trust.

01:20:15.175 --> 01:20:19.545
As you approach a fight
to save our way of life.

01:20:20.205 --> 01:20:23.152
As much as I believe
of inhibitors

01:20:23.403 --> 01:20:27.958
and some laws,
that would stop the chaos

01:20:28.696 --> 01:20:34.882
all studies show
the war has begun.

01:20:35.426 --> 01:20:39.901
Many confused
and many stupid people,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.948
out there, and began to question

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:44.082
began to think!

01:20:52.449 --> 01:20:55.262
Thank you.

01:20:55.660 --> 01:21:01.156
In analyzing the learned
and what others know

01:21:01.442 --> 01:21:02.555
and that is a
fundamental truth

01:21:02.772 --> 01:21:07.483
that there is a union in the world,
where men have evolved

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.873
beyond the emotions,
become enthusiastic

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:14.294
opponents of our system,
where there

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.621
dreams or explosions,

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.966
because there are no actions or
independent thinking.

01:21:22.013 --> 01:21:29.390
Of course, the real
peace can exist.

01:21:42.335 --> 01:21:46.287
What you thought
when designing this to you?

01:21:49.924 --> 01:21:51.553
Dreams of death.

01:21:54.006 --> 01:21:56.587
Suffers pain?

01:21:56.975 --> 01:21:58.080
Yes

01:21:58.098 --> 01:21:59.934
Part of you is angry.

01:22:07.104 --> 01:22:10.185
I like you, tuntia.

01:22:10.906 --> 01:22:17.742
I'll show you how
can have the peace you want,

01:22:18.279 --> 01:22:22.628
and live in the world
know is coming.

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.015
Do this and your pain will stop.

01:22:30.844 --> 01:22:34.186
It will not have another dream
for the rest of your life.

01:22:52.558 --> 01:22:57.999
"Shoot what you love."

01:23:16.717 --> 01:23:18.346
"Month of TunT"

01:24:04.904 --> 01:24:07.032
Hello! Welcome to Isadora.

01:24:07.095 --> 01:24:08.861
I would like to eat something?

01:24:09.184 --> 01:24:13.653
Please. Here
no place to sit.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.488
Thank you. Not a good night?
Be right back.

01:24:18.698 --> 01:24:20.661
Wait. Do not you remember?

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.545
It was a weird before?

01:24:23.644 --> 01:24:25.919
Yes
- Great!

01:24:26.527 --> 01:24:28.207
I wonder if I
to take a walk.

01:24:28.233 --> 01:24:30.445
I like walks.
What kind of ride?

01:24:30.506 --> 01:24:33.145
A boat trip.

01:24:37.226 --> 01:24:39.368
Want something to drink?

01:25:00.997 --> 01:25:05.180
Do not know if I'll understand.

01:25:05.622 --> 01:25:14.481
But, of all places in the world
I'd rather be here in the boat. Water.

01:25:21.024 --> 01:25:25.775
I met her in
restaurant of his father.

01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:30.184
Was sitting in
table like this.

01:25:30.273 --> 01:25:35.531
With our hand
next, as now.

01:25:40.411 --> 01:25:45.196
I'll take it. Now, let's see.

01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:55.129
I'll put it again
to stop the pain of both.

01:26:13.754 --> 01:26:15.314
Charisma.

01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:19.269
Want something to drink?

01:26:37.135 --> 01:26:42.678
"AM 1440 music of the past. Well,

01:26:42.924 --> 01:26:47.056
my friends, I'm saying goodbye. "

01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:51.698
Nothing. Nothing more.

01:26:51.713 --> 01:26:56.986
"Tomorrow I have come to be the Lord
Happiness, at the hour of comedy Slap.

01:26:57.059 --> 01:27:01.079
Now say goodbye.
We will miss the wonderful ...

01:27:01.193 --> 01:27:08.952
Now listen.
Return when ... "

01:27:57.609 --> 01:28:00.838
George.

01:28:06.931 --> 01:28:10.010
George.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.031
George.

01:29:24.194 --> 01:29:35.001
A translation "        ".

01:29:36.305 --> 01:29:42.223
