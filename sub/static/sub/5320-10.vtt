00:00.727 --> 00:02.928
<i>I put in my time, paid my dues,</i>
<i>now I got a shot to ref</i>

00:02.996 --> 00:04.974
- in the big leagues.
- Really?

00:05.094 --> 00:06.427
Community college.
Wow, Pete,

00:06.495 --> 00:07.495
way to go. You're
really breaking through

00:07.563 --> 00:08.596
that striped ceiling.

00:08.664 --> 00:09.797
I got to be on my "A" game, man.

00:09.865 --> 00:11.132
These guys don't mess around.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.367
Gonna go practice my moves
in the mirror.

00:12.434 --> 00:14.168
I've been noticing
that my double dribble signs

00:14.236 --> 00:15.503
have been looking like bongos.

00:15.571 --> 00:17.138
It's sloppy.
Gentlemen.

00:17.206 --> 00:18.339
I've got a big
announcement to make.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.174
Pete, you're gonna
want to stick around for this.

00:20.242 --> 00:21.910
Agree to disagree.

00:21.977 --> 00:24.112
Uh...
I've made a big decision.

00:24.179 --> 00:25.613
You're gonna want to hear this.
I'm retiring

00:25.681 --> 00:28.182
from sex due to concussions.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.290
What are you saying?
I know

00:29.351 --> 00:30.551
a lot of football players
are retiring

00:30.619 --> 00:32.299
due to head trauma,
and I feel the same way

00:32.320 --> 00:34.255
about sexual intercourse.

00:34.323 --> 00:36.758
Why are you getting concussions during sex?
Oh, Kevin.

00:36.825 --> 00:38.393
Your sex life is so sad.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.028
Taco, sex is arguably

00:40.095 --> 00:41.863
the only thing you're good at.
Trust me,

00:41.931 --> 00:44.565
I love the game. But I got
to protect the old noggin.

00:44.633 --> 00:46.534
What-what are you doing?
Ladies,

00:46.602 --> 00:49.304
listen up.
I regret to inform you

00:49.371 --> 00:52.273
that I will not be able
to have sex with you tonight.

00:52.341 --> 00:54.542
I'm retiring from sex.

00:54.610 --> 00:56.678
So, aside from
the occasional morning wood,

00:56.745 --> 00:59.714
this penis shall remain flaccid.

00:59.782 --> 01:02.317
However, if you are interested
in two minutes of missionary

01:02.384 --> 01:05.119
or some creepy spooning with no penetration...
No.

01:05.187 --> 01:07.522
...please feel free
to talk to my friends over here.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.524
Get off the bar!
What is wrong with you?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.225
What are you gonna do with
all your free time now?

01:11.293 --> 01:12.493
Well, first things first...

01:12.561 --> 01:14.262
I'm gonna throw
a retirement party.

01:14.330 --> 01:16.164
Bartender, shots.

01:16.231 --> 01:17.332
Let's celebate.

01:17.399 --> 01:18.967
What... Celebate?

01:19.034 --> 01:20.301
Celebrate celibacy.
You know what, Taco,

01:20.369 --> 01:21.803
I'm proud of you.
Putting your mental health

01:21.870 --> 01:23.037
in front of everything else.

01:23.105 --> 01:25.006
Thank you.
Let's get wasted.

01:25.074 --> 01:26.341
There it is.

01:30.846 --> 01:32.246
<i>It's just a little
mommy makeover down there</i>

01:32.314 --> 01:36.050
so that when I get home,
everything is extra special.

01:36.118 --> 01:38.786
I'm not entirely comfortable
with a Puerto Rican doctor

01:38.854 --> 01:42.023
staring at your sweet "V,"
but I don't mind the results.

01:42.091 --> 01:44.359
It's really no big deal.

01:44.426 --> 01:46.160
Aw,<i> Jesuchristo.</i>
I did it...

01:46.228 --> 01:48.229
I did it after I had Sofia.
Mami...

01:48.297 --> 01:50.999
Wish you'd had it sealed up
entirely before you had Rafi.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.633
Ma, please. It's gonna feel better.
Supple, more s...

01:52.701 --> 01:54.168
Mami, please, shh, shh.
I get it!

01:54.236 --> 01:55.603
Mom...
I just have to make sure you know

01:55.671 --> 01:57.538
it's gonna be tighter.

01:57.606 --> 01:59.273
<i>How psyched are you guys</i>

01:59.341 --> 02:00.908
<i>for the series finale</i>
<i>of</i> The Block?

02:00.976 --> 02:03.745
Not at all. I don't watch that show.
Neither do I.

02:03.812 --> 02:05.680
How can you not watch the show?
Seven years.

02:05.748 --> 02:07.949
We have been
watching it from episode one,

02:08.017 --> 02:09.584
back before Netflix.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.119
Yeah, during the commercials...
Ah, ah, ah... listening to people

02:11.186 --> 02:12.720
talk about a show
you don't watch

02:12.788 --> 02:14.122
is like listening
to people talk about

02:14.189 --> 02:15.523
a fantasy league you're not in.

02:15.591 --> 02:17.625
Maybe I should start
watching this stupid show.

02:17.693 --> 02:19.527
Now that I'm retired,
I got plenty of time.

02:19.595 --> 02:22.230
I need to start wasting
my life away like you guys.

02:22.297 --> 02:23.631
You're retired?
Yup.

02:23.699 --> 02:25.533
Threw in the old come towel.
Ew.

02:25.601 --> 02:27.535
What are you
gonna do all day, Taco?

02:27.603 --> 02:29.237
Well, it's important to spread
the word about the dangers

02:29.304 --> 02:31.973
of sex. Maybe my story
can help save someone else.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.741
Dangers of sex?
You wear a condom.

02:33.809 --> 02:36.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't want
to kill a fly with a shotgun.

02:36.345 --> 02:37.912
Plus, a condom's
not gonna protect you

02:37.980 --> 02:39.213
against a cockcussion.

02:39.281 --> 02:40.815
Okay, Les Welker.

02:40.883 --> 02:44.018
* Womp, bam, bam,
bam-bam, bam, bow. *

02:44.086 --> 02:45.353
Guess who got laid last night.

02:45.421 --> 02:47.755
The guy who plays Khal Drogo?
Maybe, but I

02:47.823 --> 02:49.924
also had my own Game of Bones.

02:49.992 --> 02:52.660
Let's just say all the girls
came down to my King's Landing.

02:52.728 --> 02:54.195
- Oh, God, Andre. Aw.
- Okay.

02:54.263 --> 02:55.563
I know you're all
dying for details,

02:55.631 --> 02:57.131
but a gentleman never tells.

02:57.199 --> 02:59.319
Fair enough.
But fortunately for you, last night

02:59.334 --> 03:01.869
was no night for a gentleman.

03:01.937 --> 03:03.271
<i>So I was hanging</i>
<i>with my bros, you know,</i>

03:03.338 --> 03:04.472
<i>the T to the O and MacArth Vader</i>

03:04.540 --> 03:06.674
Andre, you are the best!

03:06.742 --> 03:08.843
Andre, your jokes are so funny.

03:08.911 --> 03:10.645
<i>And I had to bid them adieu.</i>

03:10.712 --> 03:12.580
Guys, I got
one thing to say to you.

03:12.648 --> 03:14.482
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.184
Oh, oh, no!
Oh!

03:20.322 --> 03:22.056
<i>No way.</i>

03:22.124 --> 03:23.591
That's not what happened at all.

03:23.659 --> 03:25.526
<i>Hasta le vista,</i> baby.

03:25.594 --> 03:27.462
you.

03:27.529 --> 03:29.664
Schwarzenegger.
<i>Terminator.</i> Guys...

03:29.731 --> 03:31.299
Yeah, choke on it.

03:31.366 --> 03:32.967
<i>I was too drunk to drive home,</i>

03:33.035 --> 03:35.403
<i>so I called an Uber.</i>
<i>I slid in</i>

03:35.471 --> 03:37.071
and let the games begin.

03:37.139 --> 03:39.173
I mean,<i> The Hunger Games</i>

03:39.241 --> 03:41.709
parody movie,<i> The Sex Games.</i>

03:41.777 --> 03:43.478
<i>We were just having</i>
<i>this witty back and forth.</i>

03:43.545 --> 03:45.880
Oh, my gosh, I like your cap.
I got a cap.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.882
You've got great taste in general.
Eh.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.990
I feel like I could just
talk to you about anything.

03:50.018 --> 03:51.319
Ah...
We're, like, on the same page.

03:51.386 --> 03:52.920
Like, we're on the level.

03:52.988 --> 03:54.188
You know what I mean?
Like, we're there,

03:54.256 --> 03:55.790
together, right now.
Wait, what?

03:55.858 --> 03:57.758
<i>So I decided to make my move.</i>

03:57.826 --> 03:59.227
Let me tell you something.

03:59.294 --> 04:02.230
"People are people."

04:02.297 --> 04:04.365
Depeche Mode.

04:08.070 --> 04:10.271
One thing leads to the next,
and...

04:10.339 --> 04:11.272
Oh, God.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.107
You totally get me.

04:13.175 --> 04:15.209
What? What are you doing?
Come to mama.

04:15.277 --> 04:17.178
You're mine!

04:17.245 --> 04:19.113
<i>We're getting sloppy.</i>

04:19.180 --> 04:21.115
Reason why you should
never get cloth seats...

04:21.183 --> 04:22.683
leather. Easier to...

04:22.751 --> 04:24.152
...clean.

04:24.219 --> 04:25.520
Is this is a one-night stand?

04:25.587 --> 04:27.822
Aah, aah, aah! Yes!
You bet it is, baby!

04:27.890 --> 04:29.457
I've never done this before.
Aah!

04:29.525 --> 04:31.125
This is so cool!

04:31.193 --> 04:32.860
Take me from behind!
What? What?

04:32.928 --> 04:35.129
You are like
a better-dressed,

04:35.197 --> 04:37.298
more street-smart
Steve Harvey!

04:37.366 --> 04:39.834
Really?
That's what I was going for!

04:39.902 --> 04:41.302
Get in my hole!

04:44.273 --> 04:45.673
Yes, yes!
Yes!

04:45.741 --> 04:47.341
Yes!

04:47.409 --> 04:49.143
Andre was on top form.

04:49.211 --> 04:51.512
If she was rating me,
she'd give me five stars.

04:51.580 --> 04:53.381
And I would give her four.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.449
Wait, why would you give
her a four-star review?

04:55.517 --> 04:56.651
I didn't like
the route she took.

04:56.718 --> 04:58.619
I felt it was
a little circuitous.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.210
Oh, man.

05:04.277 --> 05:07.413
Yeah. Nice gym.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.547
Short bursts...

05:08.615 --> 05:09.815
About the infraction.
Long bursts...

05:09.883 --> 05:11.851
Then it becomes about you.

05:11.918 --> 05:13.986
Hey, new guy.

05:14.054 --> 05:15.955
Hey. Hey, Pete Eckhart.
Dave.

05:16.022 --> 05:17.823
Dave, nice to meet you,
Dave. Pete Eckhart.

05:17.891 --> 05:20.226
My name's Pete.
Uh, Pete.

05:20.293 --> 05:22.027
So...

05:22.095 --> 05:24.764
Right on. You guys must
be big sports nuts, huh?

05:24.831 --> 05:25.831
You guys into fantasy?

05:25.899 --> 05:28.000
Fantasy?
Like Peter Pan?

05:28.068 --> 05:29.402
You know what I'm really into?

05:29.469 --> 05:31.203
Controlling
a young man's destiny

05:31.271 --> 05:33.539
with the blow of a whistle.
In reality.

05:33.607 --> 05:34.907
With real people.
Well,

05:34.975 --> 05:36.041
we'll see you out there.
Okay.

05:36.109 --> 05:38.677
Good talk,
good talking to you guys.

05:38.745 --> 05:41.280
Wrapping it up.
Oh, man, it's gonna be amazing.

05:41.348 --> 05:42.848
I've been waiting seven years

05:42.916 --> 05:44.517
for the final episode of...

05:44.584 --> 05:46.452
<i>The Block!</i>

05:48.422 --> 05:49.755
Tell me about it.
Oh, my gosh...

05:49.823 --> 05:51.757
You guys, uh, fans of <i> The Block?</i>

05:51.825 --> 05:53.793
Yeah!
You like <i> The Block?</i>

05:53.860 --> 05:56.862
I am the biggest fan.
I have seen every episode.

05:56.930 --> 05:58.764
Oh, my God.
Shut up. In fact,

05:58.832 --> 06:00.032
I was watching
before it was on Netflix.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.367
I got all my friends into it.

06:01.435 --> 06:03.035
Started in season one,
and then, um...

06:03.103 --> 06:04.236
Let him know, let him know!

06:04.304 --> 06:05.671
I don't know.
Oh!

06:05.739 --> 06:07.006
Bam!

06:07.073 --> 06:10.576
Right, 'cause that
guy's on <i> The Block.</i>

06:10.644 --> 06:12.812
Agent Baker is my spirit animal.
He shaped, really,

06:12.879 --> 06:14.980
my whole essence as a man.
I watched the show

06:15.048 --> 06:16.649
all the way through three times,

06:16.716 --> 06:19.518
and then I realized,
"What if I watch it backwards?"

06:19.586 --> 06:22.254
- No way. - I've been going forward, looking
for Easter eggs. I didn't

06:22.322 --> 06:25.424
think of going backwards, looking
for egg Easters. Ideally, you would

06:25.492 --> 06:28.093
synch it up with the second half
of <i> Dark Side of the Moon</i>

06:28.161 --> 06:30.763
- and <i> Wizard of Oz</i> playing
in the background. - Shut your hole.

06:30.831 --> 06:32.152
What are you doing
for the finale?

06:32.165 --> 06:33.866
Uh, you know, I was
just gonna, you know...

06:33.934 --> 06:35.067
I know where you're watching it.

06:35.135 --> 06:36.202
I do, too!
Here.

06:36.269 --> 06:37.403
With us!

06:37.471 --> 06:39.472
You're gonna share
your theories.

06:39.539 --> 06:40.739
You've gone further
down the rabbit hole

06:40.807 --> 06:42.241
than anyone we hang out with.

06:42.309 --> 06:45.377
I am incredibly far
down the rabbit hole.

06:48.381 --> 06:49.882
Oh, that Uber is quick.

06:51.885 --> 06:53.686
Hey. I am just going to...

06:53.753 --> 06:56.121
Hey, Andre.
Good to see you.

06:56.189 --> 06:59.325
- Hey. - Do you want a drink? I brought
you a little champagne.

06:59.392 --> 07:01.026
A little champers.

07:01.094 --> 07:03.229
Uh, I don't know if I should
actually be drinking.

07:03.296 --> 07:04.563
Cheers.
Wait.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.632
You jus... Wait. Whoa! Hey!

07:06.700 --> 07:08.100
Are you supposed
to be drinking and driving?

07:08.168 --> 07:09.768
Good one.

07:09.836 --> 07:11.937
Oh, my God, it's so
good to see you again.

07:12.005 --> 07:13.672
Thanks for calling.
It was random,

07:13.740 --> 07:15.708
I imagine, you know, 'cause I
just hit the button, you know...

07:15.775 --> 07:17.243
I've been thinking so
much about what you said

07:17.310 --> 07:18.511
last night.

07:18.578 --> 07:20.946
I feel like we really connected.
Do you?

07:21.014 --> 07:22.348
We did have a connection.

07:22.415 --> 07:25.618
It was a great, intense...
one-night

07:25.685 --> 07:26.885
connection, you know, and I...

07:26.887 --> 07:28.087
Men are pigs.

07:28.154 --> 07:29.455
You know that, right?

07:29.523 --> 07:30.990
It's like, I cannot

07:31.057 --> 07:33.526
tell you the number of men
that have picked me up

07:33.593 --> 07:35.461
in this Uber because I'm so hot,

07:35.529 --> 07:38.264
and they just want me for my
holes... each and every hole.

07:38.331 --> 07:40.566
And it's like, "Buddy, my
holes are tired." You know?

07:40.634 --> 07:42.268
We hit it off, and then,
the next thing you know,

07:42.335 --> 07:43.469
it's, like, "Claire,
stop calling here."

07:43.537 --> 07:44.503
"Claire, stop
talking to my wife."

07:44.571 --> 07:45.804
"Claire, get off my lawn."

07:45.872 --> 07:47.339
"Claire, stop picking
my kids up from school."

07:47.407 --> 07:48.941
But I'm, like, "What about me?

07:49.009 --> 07:51.443
I need someone to check me out
of this hospital!"

07:53.813 --> 07:55.681
You're different.

07:55.749 --> 07:57.383
Yeah.

07:57.450 --> 07:59.385
Child locks.

08:01.254 --> 08:02.955
<i>So, if I</i>

08:03.023 --> 08:05.090
show up to watch the finale
with these guys,

08:05.158 --> 08:07.026
not knowing what happened,
I'm gonna be barred

08:07.093 --> 08:08.694
from the whole
community college ref world.

08:08.762 --> 08:11.330
As ultimate fans of The
Block, would you guys kind of

08:11.398 --> 08:14.366
give me a little rundown,
kind of so I can fake it?

08:14.434 --> 08:16.468
Why?!
Why would you want to fake it?

08:16.536 --> 08:19.071
You are missing
a cultural experience.

08:19.139 --> 08:21.259
If it's so good, why is it
ending after seven seasons?

08:21.274 --> 08:22.508
I don't know.
Please.

08:22.576 --> 08:23.709
Just a small recap.

08:23.777 --> 08:25.177
So, in a nutshell,

08:25.245 --> 08:29.281
a futuristic noir detective show
placed in an alternate L.A.

08:29.349 --> 08:31.069
But we see everything
through a time schism.

08:31.117 --> 08:32.384
But you don't

08:32.452 --> 08:33.852
find that out till season two.
You know, that's...

08:33.919 --> 08:35.120
Yeah, so, spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.355
First of all,
I don't know what a schism is.

08:36.423 --> 08:37.789
Second of all, spoil me.

08:37.857 --> 08:40.125
Alert me.
Time schisms are very, very important.

08:40.193 --> 08:41.626
I think
the whole thing's a time schism.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.261
I think it's all going
through Agent Baker's mind.

08:43.330 --> 08:44.330
Baker. Great.
Tell me about Baker.

08:44.397 --> 08:46.398
Oh, he's dreamy.

08:46.466 --> 08:48.734
He's also a total drime head.
What is drime?

08:48.802 --> 08:49.802
- It's like a futuristic heroin.
- Yeah.

08:49.869 --> 08:51.036
Why not call it heroin?

08:51.104 --> 08:52.271
Because it's drime.

08:52.339 --> 08:54.707
He's part of this agency.
It's very corrupt.

08:54.774 --> 08:56.075
So Wonder Well Corporation

08:56.142 --> 08:57.876
has created androids

08:57.944 --> 08:59.664
to keep an eye
on all of these corrupt cops.

08:59.679 --> 09:01.313
And his android is L.E.

09:01.381 --> 09:02.848
Oh, "Ellie" like your daughter.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.017
"L.E." Not "Ellie."
L...

09:05.085 --> 09:06.352
She's an android.
L.E.'s a girl?

09:06.419 --> 09:07.620
Yes, they're all flesh jobs.
It's not the point.

09:07.687 --> 09:09.388
What's a "flesh job"?
The point is...

09:09.456 --> 09:11.523
It's an android!
...that Baker can't have sex with an android.

09:11.591 --> 09:13.192
But...
And I've been telling you this for years.

09:13.259 --> 09:15.661
And you can...
No. He can have sex with L.E. Prime.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.664
How do you tell the difference
between L.E. and L.E. Prime?

09:18.732 --> 09:19.865
The accent.
Yeah, the accent.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.233
It's a different accent.

09:21.301 --> 09:22.234
Oh, of course.
I should have known.

09:22.302 --> 09:23.369
Ruben is his boss.

09:23.436 --> 09:25.304
He's bad, he's a really bad guy.

09:25.372 --> 09:27.072
But he wasn't bad in season one.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.108
Ruben is also in
with the Supplement.

09:29.175 --> 09:30.256
Kevin, it's the Settlement.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.710
The Settlement.
The Settlement. Sorry.

09:31.778 --> 09:34.213
Settlement took Baker's kid
Reggie.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.748
No! Reggie's
back with Baker.

09:35.815 --> 09:37.383
Kevin, that was a flashback!

09:37.450 --> 09:39.084
It was a schism within a schism.
Oh.

09:39.152 --> 09:40.452
You can have a schism
within a schism?

09:40.520 --> 09:41.787
Of course there can be
a schism within a schism.

09:41.855 --> 09:43.188
Double schism.
It's the future.

09:43.256 --> 09:46.091
You guys are the worst
show recappers ever.

09:46.159 --> 09:47.393
This could not be
more complicated.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.094
I don't know how we
could make it more simple.

09:49.162 --> 09:51.330
This is great. Now I have
to watch seven seasons

09:51.398 --> 09:53.432
of this ridiculous
television show

09:53.500 --> 09:55.367
just so I can impress
these goddamn refs.

09:55.435 --> 09:56.535
I mean, shit!

09:56.603 --> 09:58.037
Sint!
Sint!

09:58.104 --> 09:59.705
Sint.
Sint!

09:59.773 --> 10:01.540
What is "sint?"
It's their cursing.

10:01.608 --> 10:03.609
You know what? I got to say,
that was a pretty sinty recap.

10:03.677 --> 10:04.877
Oh, you have a
pretty sinty attitude.

10:04.944 --> 10:07.513
Oh, thank God I made it.
Whoa.

10:07.580 --> 10:09.381
- Did she follow me?
- Well, if by "she," you mean

10:09.449 --> 10:11.283
your cologne, then, yes,
she did, and she's disgusting.

10:11.351 --> 10:12.618
My Uber driver is stalking me.

10:12.686 --> 10:14.386
The one I had
the one-night stand with.

10:14.454 --> 10:15.688
She's a psycho.

10:15.755 --> 10:16.922
Right, wherever I go,
she's there.

10:16.990 --> 10:19.024
How about just take
a different Uber?

10:19.092 --> 10:21.326
She'd kill my rating. She's the
only one that will pick me up.

10:21.394 --> 10:22.494
On the series
finale of <i> The Block...</i>

10:22.562 --> 10:23.462
Oh.
Oh! Oh!

10:23.530 --> 10:24.596
Look at this!
Oh, yes!

10:24.664 --> 10:25.964
Under both our skins

10:26.032 --> 10:27.533
is a series
of complex organisms.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.534
What is this?

10:28.601 --> 10:30.102
This is awesome.

10:30.170 --> 10:32.604
Oh, sint, they're up to
their old tricks again.

10:32.672 --> 10:35.174
The recreational device
belonging to your son?

10:35.241 --> 10:36.709
Reggie.
That's his son!

10:36.776 --> 10:38.477
His name is Reggie.

10:38.545 --> 10:40.446
- Yeah, I'm a drime head.
- Oh!

10:40.513 --> 10:41.780
Oh, God, he's hit the drime!

10:41.848 --> 10:43.816
At least I can still feel
something.

10:43.883 --> 10:44.817
He can feel something.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.151
The time schism.

10:46.219 --> 10:47.886
We need to jump
before it closes.

10:47.954 --> 10:49.321
Where are we gonna watch
the last episode?

10:49.389 --> 10:50.155
We got to do it right.

10:50.223 --> 10:51.090
It has to be big

10:51.157 --> 10:52.725
and special... not here.

10:52.792 --> 10:53.992
At my house... I got the Curve.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.328
- No, special.
- She said special, not stupid.

10:56.396 --> 10:57.396
Math class is over.

10:58.465 --> 10:59.698
If you guys want,

10:59.766 --> 11:01.600
the refs are throwing
this big viewing party.

11:01.668 --> 11:02.868
- A viewing.
- A <i> Block</i> party!

11:02.936 --> 11:04.536
The Settlement provides.

11:04.604 --> 11:06.438
The Settlement provides.
The Settlement

11:06.506 --> 11:07.706
provides.

11:07.774 --> 11:09.775
Can I come in costume?
Can I stop you?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.543
No!

11:17.044 --> 11:18.204
What the hell?

11:18.331 --> 11:20.599
Somebody popped my tires.

11:22.235 --> 11:24.231
Hey, baby doll.
You need a lift?

11:24.335 --> 11:27.237
No, no, I'm-I'm okay. I'm okay.

11:27.305 --> 11:28.471
Where you going?

11:28.539 --> 11:30.207
Oh, is this cat and mouse?
I love this!

11:30.274 --> 11:32.142
<i>Damn it, L.E.,
I don't need a lecture!</i>

11:32.210 --> 11:35.078
I
need a friend, and right now.

11:35.146 --> 11:37.914
Okay, that's L.E.,
that's L.E. Prime.

11:37.982 --> 11:39.516
L.E.'s clearing trying
to sint Baker,

11:39.584 --> 11:41.518
but she can't because
she's a flesh job. Got it.

11:41.586 --> 11:43.320
Or can she?
'Cause these flesh jobs

11:43.387 --> 11:45.222
are clearly sinting.
Friend?

11:45.289 --> 11:46.923
I mean, they're just sinting
all over each other.

11:46.991 --> 11:48.858
Which L.E. are you?
It's me.

11:48.926 --> 11:50.327
It's not me.

11:50.394 --> 11:51.695
What?! No.

11:51.762 --> 11:52.963
No way.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.398
Oh, my... I'm sorry.
I'm such a drime head.

11:55.466 --> 11:57.067
Baker's this close
to finding the Settlement.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.803
Sint!
Why do you say "sint"? Just say "shit"!

11:59.870 --> 12:01.571
You don't have to be coy about it.
After Grandy

12:01.639 --> 12:03.173
became Councilman Elect,
he ordered

12:03.241 --> 12:05.208
Wonder Well
to clean up the system.

12:05.276 --> 12:07.043
What's going on with
Ruben? Is he turning?!

12:07.111 --> 12:08.478
Hey.
I mean, oh, maybe

12:08.546 --> 12:10.580
he's just protecting them.
Look at that face! Look!

12:12.116 --> 12:13.750
You're not gonna wash
your hands, man?

12:13.818 --> 12:15.885
What's wrong with you?

12:15.953 --> 12:17.220
Bye-bye, Baker.

12:17.288 --> 12:18.521
Which one?

12:18.589 --> 12:20.257
What year is this taking place?
I don't know.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.658
- Oh. Oh.
- Guess!

12:21.726 --> 12:24.194
That one.
It's a schism within a schism.

12:24.262 --> 12:26.463
All right, all right.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.765
No, that's not the Settlement!
They want you to think it is.

12:30.034 --> 12:31.434
- Oh, come on, ref!
- Hey, flagrant foul!

12:31.502 --> 12:32.602
Bullshit!

12:32.670 --> 12:33.703
Oh, yeah. Foul.

12:33.771 --> 12:34.671
Four... foul.

12:34.739 --> 12:35.739
Bullshit, ref!

12:35.806 --> 12:38.808
Well, where were we,
Agent Baker?

12:38.876 --> 12:41.177
Wait. Is this whole episode
a dream or a flash-forward?

12:41.245 --> 12:44.114
What the sint?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.082
- Explain that.
- I can't.

12:46.150 --> 12:48.685
After the schism,
nothing makes sense.

12:48.753 --> 12:51.388
This girl I'm going out with
was almost on <i> The Bachelor.</i>

12:51.455 --> 12:53.957
Wow. She must be a
really good person.

12:54.025 --> 12:56.359
- Cool enough for me to bring her
to the <i> Block</i> party. - Andre, sex

12:56.427 --> 12:57.627
will lead to
nothing but trouble.

12:57.695 --> 12:58.662
No.<i> No</i> sex

12:58.729 --> 13:00.096
is the problem.

13:00.164 --> 13:02.165
Sofia's been gone so long,
I'm done celebating.

13:02.233 --> 13:04.668
My balls feel like
two bruised plums

13:04.735 --> 13:06.970
that have been sitting
at the bottom of a shopping bag.

13:07.038 --> 13:08.204
Is Ruben Dondo?

13:08.272 --> 13:09.673
Is Dondo Ruben? I mean,

13:09.740 --> 13:12.309
is there any sinting difference
in the long run there?

13:12.376 --> 13:14.811
Criminy! I realize
I have to feed my meter.

13:14.879 --> 13:16.746
Oh. Uh, that's fair.
I know what that is.

13:16.814 --> 13:18.948
Ooh, boy.
Ah, sint.

13:19.016 --> 13:20.150
Well, that sucked.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.718
Well, that's good, Pete,

13:21.786 --> 13:23.753
because sex'll do nothing
but rot your brain.

13:23.821 --> 13:25.221
Look at me.
Mentally,

13:25.289 --> 13:26.589
I'm not there anymore.

13:26.657 --> 13:27.738
I tried watching <i>The Block.</i>

13:27.792 --> 13:29.192
I didn't understand
a goddamn thing.

13:29.193 --> 13:31.194
That, for once, has nothing
to do with your melon.

13:31.262 --> 13:33.196
Andre, you're a...

13:33.264 --> 13:35.065
doctor.

13:35.132 --> 13:37.701
Can you examine me, please?
For what?

13:37.768 --> 13:39.448
- I think I have C.T.E.
- What's C.T.E.?

13:39.470 --> 13:40.770
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy

13:40.838 --> 13:42.472
from all the concussions.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.420
If you can say it, you
definitely don't have it.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.376
If you had C.T.E.,
you'd have memory loss.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.445
Well, I forgot to set my lineup.

13:48.512 --> 13:50.413
That happens every week.
Impaired judgment.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.548
I found this pill
in the bathroom.

13:51.615 --> 13:52.816
You guys want to go splitsies?

13:52.883 --> 13:54.017
I would not take that
if I were you.

13:54.085 --> 13:55.552
Impulse control problems?

13:55.619 --> 13:57.053
Down the hatch.

13:57.121 --> 13:58.121
You shouldn't have
swallowed that.

13:58.189 --> 13:59.489
Aggression.

13:59.557 --> 14:01.157
You said you didn't want it!
Depression?

14:01.225 --> 14:03.493
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
yelled at you guys.

14:03.561 --> 14:04.627
Anxiety?

14:04.695 --> 14:07.263
Feels like my tongue
is sweating.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.898
And eventually, dementia.
Oh, my God, Andre!

14:08.966 --> 14:11.000
None of what you're wearing
makes sense. The camouflage,

14:11.068 --> 14:12.268
the leather hat,
the snakeskin pants.

14:12.336 --> 14:14.404
Oh, my God, I'm losing it! Aah!

14:14.472 --> 14:15.739
He actually seems

14:15.806 --> 14:16.906
pretty lucid to me.

14:16.974 --> 14:18.308
Yeah, I would agree.

14:18.376 --> 14:20.076
You are dressed like one
of Nick Cannon's bodyguards.

14:20.144 --> 14:21.745
Tiny or Terrell?

14:21.812 --> 14:23.146
<i>Skype sex, here we go.</i>

14:23.214 --> 14:24.647
All right!

14:24.715 --> 14:26.116
Okay, this is what I'm wearing.

14:26.183 --> 14:27.784
Looking good, girl.

14:27.852 --> 14:29.386
Uh, real good.
Okay, your turn.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.687
What am I wearing?

14:30.755 --> 14:35.058
T-shirt from Old Navy,
boxer... from the Gap.

14:35.126 --> 14:38.061
And inside those boxers...
my dick.

14:38.129 --> 14:40.363
How's that? Pretty good, right?

14:40.431 --> 14:42.232
It's cute. You want to kiss?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.666
Mm-hmm.

14:43.734 --> 14:47.804
Okay. Here goes the kiss.

14:50.908 --> 14:54.644
Sofia? You there, baby? Hello?

14:54.712 --> 14:57.147
Must have lost the connection,
and yet, there you are...

14:57.214 --> 15:00.216
give-me-a-kiss face, with
your ample cleavage showing,

15:00.284 --> 15:02.452
not saying a word.

15:04.722 --> 15:06.689
I think that'll probably work.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.659
Rodney?

15:09.727 --> 15:12.395
Babe? Can you see me?

15:12.463 --> 15:14.903
Oh,
I'm a little dirty Latin maid.

15:14.965 --> 15:16.499
Your penis is very dirty.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.901
It needs to be clean.

15:17.968 --> 15:21.738
I want to put the vacuum on it
so I can clean it up.

15:21.806 --> 15:23.940
Oh, okay.
You want to clean it up, baby?

15:24.008 --> 15:26.810
You can clean it up, baby. Oh.

15:26.877 --> 15:28.812
You're a dirty little lady, huh?

15:28.879 --> 15:31.514
Oh, you're a trollop.
You're a silent trollop.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.616
Rodney?!
What? What? Hi.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.318
Rodney, what did you just
call me?

15:35.386 --> 15:36.786
Uh, Sofia. I called you Sofia.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.656
What are you doing right now?

15:39.723 --> 15:41.724
I was... masturbating to you.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.726
Ew! Why would you do that?!

15:43.794 --> 15:46.029
Think how flattering that is.

15:46.096 --> 15:47.576
I could pick any image
on the Internet

15:47.598 --> 15:50.200
or the weird pornos that I have
in my underwear drawer,

15:50.267 --> 15:52.836
and I'm choosing to masturbate
to you, my wife.

15:52.903 --> 15:54.037
That's disgusting.

15:54.104 --> 15:56.372
Can I at least finish?
Ugh! I'm going.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.125
No. Please, just show me your
nipple, or at least a foot! Oh!

16:01.812 --> 16:03.946
I am so excited about the <i> Block</i> party.
So am I.

16:05.582 --> 16:08.417
Oh, by the way, everyone in the
restaurant was so overreacting

16:08.485 --> 16:11.320
about the gun.
I know. It's just a fake gun.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.849
I mean, come on.
What's the big deal?

16:13.969 --> 16:16.405
We look so great.
Oh, you know, we got to get going.

16:16.525 --> 16:18.665
Um... want to get a cab?

16:18.912 --> 16:20.713
Uh... Uber.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.334
Uh... how about we walk?

16:23.454 --> 16:25.151
Come on, it'll
be fine. Come on.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.785
No, I-I can't walk
in these shoes. Look.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.320
We'll just walk.
No. Look, we'll just Uber.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.822
It's so easy.
All you have to do

16:29.890 --> 16:31.524
is open the app and touch the phone.
I know.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.530
Oh, my God, that was so fast.
Oh, no.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.266
Where are you
two off to tonight?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.134
It's a party for the series
finale of <i> The Block.</i>

16:42.202 --> 16:43.569
It's a <i> Block</i> party!
You know, why don't you just

16:43.637 --> 16:44.937
sit in your seat just
for safety reasons?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.205
And we don't want to...

16:46.273 --> 16:47.373
Oh!
...upset the driver.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.474
Agent Baker.
No.

16:48.542 --> 16:49.808
Following the rules.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.143
I think we should
break some rules.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.478
No, no, not tonight.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.914
We're just gonna
just be two friends.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.549
So, you two, uh,
have a connection,

16:56.616 --> 16:57.917
or, um, what's the story there?

16:57.984 --> 17:00.252
He said I'm his bachelorette.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.188
We're still figuring out
a lot of things.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.622
We're just like Agent Baker

17:03.690 --> 17:05.925
and L.E., keeping
things a secret.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.226
Okay, why don't you just
sit over there?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.028
Aren't you two cute?!

17:09.095 --> 17:10.229
Aah!

17:10.297 --> 17:11.730
Oops, my bad.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.999
There was a bump in the road.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.803
- Look at this!
- It's Baker and L.E.!

17:17.871 --> 17:19.771
Baker and L.E. Yes!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.640
I'm so excited about this.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.842
- Oh, my God, this is awesome!
- Wait.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.344
Why are these guys
still dressed like refs?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.112
Why are you still dressed
like a ref?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.714
I'm trying to impress them,
okay?

17:28.782 --> 17:30.883
Jesus, I don't want to get sent
back down to the minor leagues.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.032
I haven't slept in two days,

17:32.052 --> 17:32.918
I've watched every
goddamn episode.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.687
It's like I ate a huge meal,

17:34.754 --> 17:36.674
I forgot what I ate, now
I just want to throw up.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.856
Don't worry, Pete.
I was able

17:37.924 --> 17:39.058
to watch the entire show.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.593
Really?
Yeah. Yeah. Ask me anything.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.161
Well, how did Dondo die?

17:42.229 --> 17:44.663
Dondo died?
Yeah, in season two.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.966
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There
are seasons to this thing?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.234
There's seven of them.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.768
How did you watch the show?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.036
I was just watching it
in alphabetical order

17:51.104 --> 17:52.271
based on the title.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.505
What?!
What?!

17:53.573 --> 17:54.907
No wonder people kept
coming back to life.

17:54.975 --> 17:56.508
Goddamn this brain!
All right, all right.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.144
You want to
know a funny story?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.113
I've made love in
this car. Yeah.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.482
I've made passionate, amazing,

18:03.550 --> 18:06.118
erotic love...
We don't need to hear about it.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.120
...in this car
with that man.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.421
Yup.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.093
With that man.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.995
Let me tell you something.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.830
You see this man right here?
This man that you think

18:17.897 --> 18:19.698
you have a connection
with? This man

18:19.766 --> 18:22.568
connected with my vagina
all over this Uber, okay?

18:22.636 --> 18:24.536
He ejaculated here, there,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.972
there, on your seat,
all over these leathers.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.374
So you want to put a
black light on this thing,

18:28.441 --> 18:29.575
it'll light up
like Times Square.

18:29.643 --> 18:31.477
Is that what you do?
You just pick up women,

18:31.544 --> 18:33.445
and you sleep with them, and
you just throw 'em to the curb?!

18:33.513 --> 18:35.014
No, I don't do that.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.549
It never gets to the sex stuff. I...
Oh, my God!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.685
You're just like Juan Pablo
on <i> The Bachelor.</i>

18:39.753 --> 18:42.321
Preach!
I am <i> not</i> like Juan Pablo!

18:42.389 --> 18:44.523
You're a liar! I thought
we had a connection, okay?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.258
Doesn't Claire deserve love?
I don't know!

18:46.326 --> 18:47.493
I swear to God, if
you don't tell me

18:47.560 --> 18:48.827
you love me, I'm
gonna crash this car

18:48.895 --> 18:50.162
into a wall and kill us all!

18:50.230 --> 18:51.597
Tell her you love her!
What?

18:51.665 --> 18:52.931
I'm gonna crash this
car and kill us all!

18:52.999 --> 18:54.266
Tell her you love her!
No!

18:54.334 --> 18:55.267
Tell me you love me!

18:55.335 --> 18:56.869
Tell her you love her!

18:56.936 --> 18:57.803
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

18:57.871 --> 19:01.807
And... here we are.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.709
Oh, my God.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.010
Okay. You okay?
You okay? No.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.545
No, get off me.
Do not touch me!

19:06.613 --> 19:07.780
Sorry, all right, come on, please, Berkeley.
No!

19:07.847 --> 19:09.048
Please. Come on!

19:09.115 --> 19:10.516
Oh, my God.
It's too cold to walk!

19:10.583 --> 19:13.118
Sint off, you
sinting crazy people!

19:13.186 --> 19:14.987
Berkeley, come back!
She was trouble.

19:15.055 --> 19:16.889
Jesus, what are you doing?!

19:16.956 --> 19:18.424
So, are we going to this party?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.992
I'm not really in costume. Is
there an alcoholic character?

19:20.060 --> 19:22.361
You need
to leave me alone right now!

19:22.429 --> 19:24.096
Ooh, I get it. You
want to play rough.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.531
I'm not playing.
I'm not playing.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.333
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

19:27.400 --> 19:29.168
I'm done with you!
I'm done with you!

19:29.235 --> 19:30.469
We are so in sync.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.471
What?
You get back here, Mr. Man.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.706
You get back here!

19:35.508 --> 19:36.642
Stay away from me!

19:36.710 --> 19:37.876
Get back here!
Stay away! Aah! Aah!

19:37.944 --> 19:39.178
You're mine!

19:39.245 --> 19:40.579
I'll take the bus!
I'll take the bus!

19:43.491 --> 19:45.918
When the settlement
sublimates the chosen,

19:45.985 --> 19:48.887
this is where the dead bodies
are disposed.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.957
It was all smoke and mirrors.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.792
Oh, my.
What is happening?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.627
Like so many
of your religious practices.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.331
You snooze, you don't win.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.936
People need to believe
in something.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.438
You're supposed to be dead!
So are you.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.173
I can't let you do
that, Ruben.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.445
Don't, Ruben!

20:13.513 --> 20:15.981
It's a one-night stand!
It's over!

20:16.049 --> 20:17.683
It's not over
until I say it's over!

20:17.751 --> 20:19.318
It's the end of the world.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.986
The time schism is upon us.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.921
I think I know
something that you don't.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.423
I knew it!

20:24.491 --> 20:26.558
What is going on?
What?

20:26.626 --> 20:27.893
Oh, my God!

20:29.095 --> 20:30.195
I got you, lover!

20:30.263 --> 20:31.743
This is gonna
affect your Uber rating!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.399
I got you!

20:34.701 --> 20:36.301
No!
What happened?!

20:36.369 --> 20:37.169
Taco?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.637
Taco!

20:39.572 --> 20:41.407
Ow.
Hi.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.307
I'm Claire.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.776
I'm Taco.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.843
Are you guys okay?

20:44.911 --> 20:45.878
Who are you?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.046
You want to fool around?

20:48.114 --> 20:49.014
Yeah.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.403
Taco, what about
your concussions?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.251
What concussions?
I can give you a lift.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.594
Just the sex would be fine.
Great. That sounds good.

20:54.706 --> 20:56.899
Well, looks like his concussion
cured his concussion.

20:57.019 --> 20:58.332
Taco's coming out of retirement.

20:58.452 --> 21:09.055
