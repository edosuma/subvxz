00:00.172 --> 00:01.913
Ah, we're here!

00:02.111 --> 00:04.842
Legend says these woods are evil...

00:04.960 --> 00:07.309
the perfect place to sacrifice a kitten.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.393
Oh, this place is creepy.

00:10.426 --> 00:11.412
I'll be honest.

00:11.517 --> 00:14.330
I only dress dark like
this to meet new people.

00:15.364 --> 00:17.000
OMG! Me too!

00:17.032 --> 00:20.503
Then let's go chill at
my parent's beach house!

00:20.537 --> 00:22.706
Aah! Help!

00:22.738 --> 00:25.374
Somebody call the sheriff!

00:25.407 --> 00:27.543
Ugh!

00:28.878 --> 00:32.073
Mr. Pickles!

Morning, Mama!

00:41.221 --> 00:43.025
You may eat now, Sheriff.

00:43.058 --> 00:44.528
Yay! Now.

00:44.561 --> 00:46.597
Num-num-num-num. Yummy!

00:46.629 --> 00:48.097
Right, Abigail?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.866
I know what's yummy.

00:49.899 --> 00:52.201
There's pudding in that
cupboard over there.

00:52.235 --> 00:53.369
Aw!

00:53.403 --> 00:55.539
- No pudding till after supper!
- I'm sorry.

00:55.571 --> 00:57.373
Here, I know how to cheer you up.

00:59.109 --> 01:00.510
Oh, yeah.

01:00.543 --> 01:03.279
You love it when I brush you,
don't you, Mama? Mm!

01:03.312 --> 01:04.447
- Yes, you do!
- Oh, yes.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.451
Why, Mr. BoJenkins!

01:07.484 --> 01:08.619
What's up, man?

01:08.651 --> 01:10.921
I was just chilling out, you know.

01:10.954 --> 01:13.422
Just trying to get that pudding. Ha ha.

01:13.455 --> 01:15.591
Wait. What are you doing here?

01:15.624 --> 01:16.759
Oh. Uh...

01:16.793 --> 01:19.029
I was just "pudding" some pipe down

01:19.062 --> 01:20.731
up in your mama's bedroom.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.567
Oh.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.235
Thanks, man. You're a good friend.

01:25.267 --> 01:26.736
Why don't you stay awhile?

01:26.770 --> 01:28.538
Oh, not today, Mama.

01:28.571 --> 01:30.274
I got to go see my Uncle Jimmy.

01:30.306 --> 01:32.875
You're always going to
see your Uncle Jimmy.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.610
Hmph! Bye, Mama!

01:34.643 --> 01:36.580
- Bye, Mama!
- Sheriff...

01:36.612 --> 01:38.915
I didn't know you were
such a mama's boy.

01:38.948 --> 01:40.884
You need to be a man, man!

01:40.916 --> 01:42.952
What? I am a "man" man, man!

01:42.985 --> 01:45.255
A man can eat whenever he wants.

01:45.288 --> 01:46.423
Really?

01:46.455 --> 01:49.425
Sheriff,
how 'bout I show you how to be a man?

01:49.458 --> 01:51.460
Oh, but leave your doll here.

01:51.493 --> 01:52.762
She's not a doll!

01:52.796 --> 01:54.898
She's Abigail.

01:54.931 --> 01:56.133
Ugh.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.267
Yah!

01:57.300 --> 01:58.902
Are we going to see your Uncle Jimmy?

01:58.934 --> 02:00.636
There's no Uncle Jimmy.

02:02.305 --> 02:03.740
Yah!

02:03.773 --> 02:05.442
Hyah!

02:06.633 --> 02:09.445
Now, there's three things
you got to do to be a man.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.315
Step one, have a drink.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.116
Two, get in a fight.

02:13.148 --> 02:15.752
And, three, Sheriff,
you ever been with a woman?

02:15.784 --> 02:17.653
Oh, yeah, dude. Ha ha.

02:17.687 --> 02:19.156
Nunh-unh, Sheriff.

02:19.188 --> 02:22.458
- Abigail!
- Boy, we got work to do.

02:22.492 --> 02:24.127
- Oh.
- Hey, Sheriff!

02:24.159 --> 02:26.162
- Hey, good to see you, Sheriff!
- Hi, Sheriff!

02:26.195 --> 02:29.131
My man, two whiskeys.

02:29.164 --> 02:32.668
I've never seen you drink, Sheriff.

02:32.701 --> 02:33.836
I drink... sometimes.

02:33.869 --> 02:35.137
Put that in a sippy cup.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.807
You don't sip it, Sheriff. You shoot it.

02:37.841 --> 02:39.642
Oh, yeah!

02:39.676 --> 02:41.478
♪ Ooh Mmm. ♪

02:41.510 --> 02:44.380
Ohh! Oh.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.615
Whoa!

02:45.647 --> 02:48.684
I feel good!

02:48.718 --> 02:51.154
Ha ha! Now, on to step two.

02:51.187 --> 02:52.321
No, seriously.

02:52.355 --> 02:54.291
I feel all warm and cozy,

02:54.324 --> 02:57.226
like I'm floating in
a warm universe of...

02:57.260 --> 03:00.864
happy liquids all over my wiggly body.

03:00.897 --> 03:02.032
Say what, now?

03:02.064 --> 03:03.400
Oh, what's this drink taste like?

03:03.432 --> 03:04.834
Whoa! Easy, now, player.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.168
I love you, man.

03:06.201 --> 03:07.002
Oh, all right.

03:07.035 --> 03:08.305
Oh!

03:08.337 --> 03:10.740
- And I love this song!
- Uh, Sheriff?

03:10.773 --> 03:13.242
Hey, everybody! I'm having fun!

03:14.910 --> 03:17.747
Yeah! Let's boogie-woogie-woogie!

03:17.781 --> 03:20.182
Hey!
Get your hands off my female...

03:20.216 --> 03:22.152
Unless you trying to throw down!

03:22.184 --> 03:24.688
All right, step two. Ha ha!

03:24.720 --> 03:25.688
You want to fight?

03:25.722 --> 03:27.256
Well, let's fight!

03:27.289 --> 03:28.357
- Whoa!
- Aah!

03:28.391 --> 03:29.993
Not that kind of fight, Sheriff!

03:30.026 --> 03:32.329
I think it's time you
put a plug in that jug.

03:32.361 --> 03:35.731
Don't tell me what to do!

03:35.765 --> 03:36.359
Whoa!

03:36.385 --> 03:39.735
Everybody just sit down and shut up!

03:39.768 --> 03:42.873
Sheriff's got drinking to do.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.877
Uh-oh.

03:47.726 --> 03:48.874
Look, boy!

03:48.939 --> 03:51.213
I found a rectangle.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.383
I thought you were
with your Uncle Jimmy.

03:53.415 --> 03:56.419
Where are you? I want that sausage.

03:56.452 --> 03:59.088
I'm by the River Tavern,
and I don't have a sausage.

03:59.122 --> 04:00.791
But I have a pickle you can eat.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.094
No! This is for the
talking rectangle to eat.

04:04.127 --> 04:07.897
- Hello? Hey!
- Hello?

04:07.931 --> 04:09.565
Aah! Bang, bang!

04:09.599 --> 04:11.601
Sheriff! Bang-bang, bang-bang!

04:11.634 --> 04:13.103
Sheriff, be cool, man!

04:13.135 --> 04:15.404
- Put the gun down!
- No!

04:15.438 --> 04:16.873
I'm the sheriff!

04:16.904 --> 04:19.608
I'll arrest this whole universe...

04:19.642 --> 04:22.245
even all the aliens.

04:22.277 --> 04:24.580
Aliens? Sheriff, you drunk.

04:24.613 --> 04:26.082
I'm not drunk!

04:26.114 --> 04:29.085
I'm perfectly fine!

04:29.118 --> 04:31.822
- Let's get out of here!
- No, ladies, don't leave!

04:32.474 --> 04:33.924
Oh, my God!

04:33.957 --> 04:37.060
I better call his mama. Mm.

04:37.092 --> 04:38.227
Hey. Where's my...

04:38.260 --> 04:40.162
- Looking for this?
- Uh-oh.

04:40.195 --> 04:42.431
I found your talking rectangle!

04:42.464 --> 04:43.732
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

04:43.765 --> 04:45.501
Sheriff, put some clothes on.

04:45.534 --> 04:46.770
- Mama.
- Oh, no.

04:46.803 --> 04:49.072
Mr. Blur made me drink.

04:49.104 --> 04:51.073
You think you can sex all of us

04:51.106 --> 04:53.777
and lie about going to
see your Uncle Jimmy?

04:53.810 --> 04:55.111
Ladies, I can explain!

04:55.144 --> 04:58.682
Hey. That's what you told Mama.

04:58.714 --> 04:59.950
Uh...

04:59.983 --> 05:04.521
So that means you had sex with Mama!

05:04.553 --> 05:06.957
Oh! Whoa!

05:06.989 --> 05:08.491
Aah! Ohh!

05:08.525 --> 05:09.525
- Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

05:10.626 --> 05:12.662
Whoa! Hey, come back here!

05:12.695 --> 05:14.598
Ohhhhh!

05:14.630 --> 05:18.534
Oh! Oh! Aaaahhh!

05:21.303 --> 05:23.373
Ugh!

05:23.621 --> 05:25.775
Damn, Sheriff! You drank too much.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.544
I didn't mean fight me!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.279
Although that was step two.

05:29.311 --> 05:30.347
Shut up!

05:30.380 --> 05:33.483
If you're gonna have sex with Mama,

05:33.515 --> 05:35.318
you're gonna marry her.

05:35.351 --> 05:38.547
Now, just 'cause you take
a hooptie for a test-drive

05:38.640 --> 05:40.123
don't mean you got to buy it.

05:40.155 --> 05:42.491
Don't try to change the subject.

05:42.525 --> 05:44.693
I'm talking about Mama!

05:44.726 --> 05:48.198
If you were a man, Mama's Boy,
we'd never be in this mess.

05:48.231 --> 05:51.401
Well, maybe I don't got to drink, fight,

05:51.433 --> 05:53.904
and sex to be a man.

05:54.213 --> 05:57.006
Maybe you're no friend at all.

05:57.039 --> 06:00.309
Just a no-good bozo!

06:00.790 --> 06:01.410
Fine.

06:01.443 --> 06:03.178
Let's just go our separate ways.

06:03.212 --> 06:07.551
Good luck in the wild with your doll,
Mama's Boy.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.851
She's not a doll!

06:08.885 --> 06:10.854
She's... Abigail?

06:10.887 --> 06:12.722
Abigail!

06:12.755 --> 06:13.856
Shut up, Sheriff!

06:13.890 --> 06:16.325
No, shut up, Sheriff!

06:16.359 --> 06:18.695
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up!

06:18.727 --> 06:19.929
Seriously, shut up.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.032
Something's out there!

06:23.516 --> 06:25.284
All right, I'm shutting up.

06:25.363 --> 06:28.204
But it's not because you told me to!

06:29.506 --> 06:30.773
Aw.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.676
Oh, man! My head hurts!

06:32.709 --> 06:34.844
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Why does my head hurt so bad?

06:34.876 --> 06:36.078
Will you... Shut up!

06:36.111 --> 06:37.880
There's something up in them woods.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.282
It could be cannibals.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.017
Or sexually-confused inbreds or...

06:42.051 --> 06:44.354
Oh, it's just a bunch of wolves.

06:44.387 --> 06:45.722
Wolves?!

06:45.755 --> 06:46.890
Oh!

06:46.923 --> 06:48.830
Sheriff, we got to man up

06:48.896 --> 06:49.960
and fight these wolves!

06:49.993 --> 06:53.063
Nah. You don't got to fight to be a man.

06:53.096 --> 06:55.198
Uh, come get some, wolf bitches!

06:55.231 --> 06:57.300
- Oh. Man.
- Whuh! Ahh! Wa-haa!

06:59.669 --> 07:01.438
Aah! Uhh! Uhh!

07:02.738 --> 07:04.140
Good news!

07:04.173 --> 07:05.942
I found Abigail!

07:05.974 --> 07:08.410
Not now! They eating me! Aah!

07:08.443 --> 07:11.080
Just tell the wolves to
stop or you'll arrest them.

07:11.113 --> 07:13.717
Good idea. Now, listen up, wolves!

07:13.750 --> 07:16.252
Oh, great. I already got your attention.

07:16.284 --> 07:17.953
Huh?!

07:17.986 --> 07:20.890
Now, place your paws behind your heads.

07:20.923 --> 07:22.759
Hey, the doll!

07:22.791 --> 07:23.926
They like the doll!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.628
I'm sorry. Who?

07:25.662 --> 07:27.429
Abigail.

07:27.462 --> 07:28.597
Thank you very much.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.599
Now, hi, wolves!

07:30.633 --> 07:32.068
My name is Abigail.

07:32.101 --> 07:34.637
I'm a little funny girl.
Look at me walk!

07:34.671 --> 07:36.072
♪ Doop-de, doop-de, doop, boop ♪

07:36.104 --> 07:38.575
And fly around. Whee!

07:38.608 --> 07:39.943
I can sing a song.

07:39.976 --> 07:41.011
♪ La, la-la, la-la ♪

07:41.044 --> 07:42.245
What else can I do?

07:42.277 --> 07:43.746
Look, I'm over here.

07:43.779 --> 07:45.347
And now I'm over here.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.582
And now I'm over here.

07:46.616 --> 07:47.950
- Yeah, Sheriff!
- And now I'm over here.

07:47.984 --> 07:49.118
It's working!

07:49.152 --> 07:50.919
And now I'm over here.

07:53.155 --> 07:55.025
And now I'm over here.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.093
And now I'm over here.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.029
Sheriff, wake up!

08:00.063 --> 08:01.630
Aaaaahhhh!

08:01.664 --> 08:05.631
A-A-A-Abigail!

08:06.234 --> 08:09.972
Oh! I am never drinking again.

08:10.005 --> 08:11.808
Uh-oh.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.389
The mama wolf!

08:13.758 --> 08:16.046
Goodbye, Mama's Boy!

08:16.078 --> 08:19.114
Uh! Uh! Aaaahhh!

08:19.147 --> 08:21.450
Hey, I know how to cheer you up.

08:21.484 --> 08:25.121
See, you are just cranky
'cause of these knots back here.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.456
Oh, yeah.

08:26.488 --> 08:29.125
You like it when I brush you, Mama Wolf.

08:29.157 --> 08:31.623
- Yes, you do.
- She likes you!

08:31.821 --> 08:34.605
I guess being a mama's
boy can be pretty handy.

08:34.763 --> 08:35.465
Oh, yeah.

08:35.496 --> 08:36.999
I'm pretty... pretty cool.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.335
Oh! Oh.

08:39.366 --> 08:41.003
- What?
- I, uh...

08:41.035 --> 08:42.371
What, man? What?

08:42.404 --> 08:45.475
I think Mama Wolf likes
you a little too much.

08:47.709 --> 08:48.644
What do you mean?

08:48.678 --> 08:51.681
Welcome to step three!

08:51.713 --> 08:53.082
What?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.384
Oh, no.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.819
I can't do that.

08:55.851 --> 08:59.755
You better go have sex with that wolf,
or we're dead!

09:00.077 --> 09:02.558
Oh, no.

09:02.592 --> 09:04.193
