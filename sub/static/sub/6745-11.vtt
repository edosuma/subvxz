our four bodies in the trunk,

00:37.171 --> 00:39.104
and the rest is just
the hospital staff

00:39.106 --> 00:40.739
responding
until we got here.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.674
Is there any magic
you can do

00:42.676 --> 00:45.210
with this video so we can see
the woman's face?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.079
Sorry, it's the fourth time
I've gone over it,

in the clear.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.915
All right,
what about the BMW

00:49.917 --> 00:51.850
that picked her up
and drove her away?

00:51.852 --> 00:53.152
Looked like a seven series,

00:53.154 --> 00:55.254

to read the plate.

The, uh, the woman who dropped
off our victims -- madam "x" --

01:24.185 --> 01:27.119
is going to be impossible
to identify.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.554

01:28.556 --> 01:31.323

drivers described her, too.

of the torso,

the bodies were dropped
off is his, sir.

in the palisades.

what is Mr. prager's condition?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.230
Uh, he was shot twice
in the chest.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.831
Those are his x-rays
up there, sir.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.400
Sykes: And doctors say
it's touch and go.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.735
He's in surgery,
so we can't ask who shot him,

03:23.737 --> 03:26.471
and the hospital has his phone
and wallet somewhere,

03:26.473 --> 03:29.408
but in the general chaos,
they can't seem to find them.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.743
Well, we need to find where
all these rich people were

03:31.745 --> 03:34.179
when they got shot and why
they were all together.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.715

beginning of a James Bond movie.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.352
Well, we have two sets of keys
to two very nice missing cars,

at the original crime scene.

this hospital,

he'll end up in the I.C.U.
On the fourth floor.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.242
I-I know this hospital
pretty well.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.979
I'll stay with Mr. prager,

04:06.981 --> 04:08.413
You sure?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.582
Yes.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.854
So, tell me this.

How do four 1%-ers

04:20.361 --> 04:22.461
and stuffed in the back
of an s.U.V.?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.630

to a really bad joke.

to go with it.

Sorry to wake you,
but I'm afraid your morning

04:45.586 --> 04:50.622
is going to be a little more
hectic than usual.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.058
I've still got lots of work
to do, obviously,

04:53.060 --> 04:55.093
and I haven't recovered
the slugs yet,

04:55.095 --> 04:57.229
but the wounds look consistent
with a .45.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.031
And they were shot
at what range?

04:59.033 --> 05:00.999
There's no stippling,
so it wasn't point-blank,

05:01.001 --> 05:02.701
but not too far away
either.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.037
Now for something odd.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.272
I can't know about the guy
in the hospital

05:07.274 --> 05:10.242

his body, but check this out.

that you dumped at the E.R.,

19:00.273 --> 19:02.473
and one for the lady
running the game.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.774
And one for
another player.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.777
There were five players?

19:06.779 --> 19:09.347
That's what I was told
when I left to get the food.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.183
When I came back inside the rug
shop, there were only four.

19:12.185 --> 19:15.419
Look, here's the question
you should be asking.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.756
Why would I steal a half
a million dollars in cash,

19:18.758 --> 19:21.859
shoot four people,
drive them to the E.R.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.761
While they're still alive?

19:25.098 --> 19:26.464
Doesn't make any sense.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.866
<i> Look, Howard won lots</i>
<i> of these games.</i>

19:28.868 --> 19:32.837
He had a half a million dollars
in my car several times.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.438
If I wanted to set him up,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.375
there are a lot of easier ways
to do it, believe me.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.577
Tao: According to
the credit-card receipts

19:39.579 --> 19:42.513
from Raleigh's prime rib,
madam x's name is Molly pace.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.849
Four arrests by vice --
two 330s.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.417
Second time, fined $500.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.086
No violent offenses.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.789
But if she had
just been robbed,

19:51.791 --> 19:55.059
where did she get the $20,000
to tip this driver?

19:55.061 --> 20:00.565
No Mercedes g-class registered
in the name of Molly pace.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.134
Well,
there is one other person

20:03.136 --> 20:05.603
who might know something
about her.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.272
Anna:
Uh, yeah, I know Molly.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.608
Uh, she does some investing
with my dad.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.543
If you'd let me tell people
where he is,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.445
I-I could've put you in touch
with her.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.613
Now there may be no time.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.782
And what makes you
say that?

20:17.784 --> 20:20.384
I just got an alert from my
father's "preferred skies" app.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.819
He set it up for me
so I'd know

20:21.821 --> 20:23.654
if he had to suddenly fly
off somewhere.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.656
Your father's still
in intensive care.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.291
But Molly
shares his account.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.026
Looks like she's going
to Mexico city.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.562
I don't think you can catch her
before she leaves.

came back

25:23.789 --> 25:25.623
with our dinners
and started shouting.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.957
And why didn't you
call 911?

25:26.959 --> 25:29.159
Because I was running
an illegal card game,

25:29.161 --> 25:31.128

away from a hospital.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.958

that you're saying is true,

26:00.960 --> 26:02.326

to flee the country?

26:02.328 --> 26:05.429

26:05.431 --> 26:08.365

26:08.367 --> 26:09.700
A-aside from the game,

26:09.702 --> 26:11.368
I do lots of business
with Howard.

of these together,

the kind that Dan the driver
picked up for dinner.

that you took to the hospital.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.413
And the seventh steak
went to?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.518
Dan said there was
a fifth player.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.987
Oh.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.789
You haven't figured out
who that was yet?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.958
Wow. Okay.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.295
If you want the name
of the fifth player --

27:11.297 --> 27:14.131

who got knocked out of the game

left before the shooting.

39:08.180 --> 39:12.582
So, he's at school, then --
8:30 class?

39:12.584 --> 39:14.117
Not exactly.

39:14.119 --> 39:17.020
I'm not surprised your mother
signed off on this

39:17.022 --> 39:19.556
or the defense,
but what got into hobbs?

39:19.558 --> 39:22.292
I showed her all the questions
I was going to ask,

39:22.294 --> 39:25.295
and I'm mowing her lawn
for the next eight years...

39:25.297 --> 39:27.230
If you're saying yes.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.701
I'll let you proceed
on three conditions.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.837
And they are?

39:33.839 --> 39:35.972
First, you inform me
before and after

39:35.974 --> 39:38.541
every conversation you record
with the defendant.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.378
You give me an opportunity
to review what he's said

39:41.380 --> 39:43.747
before posting anything
on "identity."

39:43.749 --> 39:45.482
Absolutely, your honor.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.250
I understand that your -- your
oversight here is -- is --
great.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.519
That brings me
to my second condition.

39:49.521 --> 39:54.090
I may expunge any and every word
of any and every interview

39:54.092 --> 39:57.560
I don't like without exception
or explanation.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.062
But, your honor,
that's censorship. My story ---

39:59.064 --> 40:01.264
oh, good,
you understand the concept.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.198
Agreed.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.967
What's your
third condition?

40:03.969 --> 40:06.636
That you follow
the directions in here

40:06.638 --> 40:11.207
and apply for a transfer to ucla
effective this January.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.343
Oh.

40:13.345 --> 40:16.112
Uh, your honor, I-I-I --

40:16.114 --> 40:18.348
it's too late for me
to start ucla.

40:18.350 --> 40:21.151
It's a formality, Mr. Beck.
It's all arranged.

40:21.153 --> 40:24.921
My wife, who watched every
second of your vlog, by the way,

40:24.923 --> 40:27.023
is one of the most
published professors

40:27.025 --> 40:28.992
in ucla's communications
department,

40:28.994 --> 40:30.460
and, according to her,

40:30.462 --> 40:33.696
you should be reporting
on more interesting subjects

40:33.698 --> 40:35.698
than digital textbooks.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.967
Digital t...

40:38.637 --> 40:40.336
Did Sharon put you up
to this?

40:40.338 --> 40:43.339
I ask the questions here,
Mr. Beck, not you!

40:43.341 --> 40:46.910
Fill out the form,
major in communications.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.778
And think about going
to law school

40:48.780 --> 40:51.481
because if you're gonna argue
about everything,

40:51.483 --> 40:53.917
you might as well
make a living at it.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.319
Uh, thank you, sir.

40:56.321 --> 40:59.823
Your honor, I mean, I-I --
I don't know what to say.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.325
"Thank you" is sufficient.

41:04.062 --> 41:09.065
This is a great opportunity
for you, Mr. Beck.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.133
Don't blow it.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.702
I won't, your honor.
I-I promise.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.538
A-and thank you for --

41:15.540 --> 41:17.207
uh, you're welcome.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.709
And close the door
behind you, please.

41:19.711 --> 41:22.378
