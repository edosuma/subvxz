You're late.

00:37.914 --> 00:39.279
I came as quickly as I could.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.954
I'm hungry. And I miss you.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.539
You are always hungry now.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.619
And cranky. I'm sorry.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.791
I know there are royal responsibilities.
I shouldn't...

00:47.882 --> 00:51.124
None that match my responsibilities
to you. And our family.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.675
I'm the one who should be sorry.

Now.

(GROWLING)

01:26.295 --> 01:27.330
Are you all right?

01:27.463 --> 01:29.419
Yeah, yeah, I think so. What was that?

01:29.507 --> 01:30.917
I don't know.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.006
Snow?

01:37.807 --> 01:38.842
What happened?

01:44.522 --> 01:45.932
We're back.

02:13.718 --> 02:14.878
Hey!

02:15.011 --> 02:16.547
Sorry I'm late.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.504
I'm guessing it means
you caught the guy.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.885
-So optimistic. I like it.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:22.226 --> 02:24.057
If you hadn't, you'd have canceled.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.722
And you know me too well.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.221
Emma Swan always gets her man.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.807
And apparently my drink. Thank you.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.232
Thank you.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.739
Hey, how did Henry's volcano do
at the science fair?

02:36.574 --> 02:39.065
It was Pompeii all over again.
Thank you for your help.

02:40.244 --> 02:43.577
Come on, all I did was
convince him not to use real lava.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.080
His teachers did appreciate that.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.242
Let's eat. I'm starving.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.458
Let's do it.

03:00.056 --> 03:01.091
You happy?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.764
With your food. You happy?

03:03.851 --> 03:04.931
Beyond happy.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.310

finish one quick work thing.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.034
-You!
-I can explain.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.205
You are a stalker!

03:29.293 --> 03:31.625
Don't scream. Just hear me out.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.662
I don't do this very often,
so treasure it, love.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.383
I've come to apologize.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.627
For trying to kiss me?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.959
l was simply trying to jog your memory.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.510
It's time for you to go. Now.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.049
Emma, your parents
are in great danger.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.392
You really have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.886
'Cause you think you're an orphan?

03:46.977 --> 03:49.059
Because that's haunted you
your whole life?

03:49.313 --> 03:51.725
I'm here to tell you
everything you've believed is wrong.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.022
You don't know me.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.186
Alas, I know you
better than you know yourself.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.487
l have proof.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.533
Take a gander, here's an address.

04:03.077 --> 04:07.616
If you wanna know who you really are,
who your parents are, go there.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.367
Leave. Now.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.537
You've been there before. A year ago.
You just don't remember.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.752
A year ago, l was in Boston.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.375
Until a fire destroyed my apartment,

04:16.507 --> 04:18.543
and I moved to New York
to have a fresh start with my son.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.086
Regina really did a number on you.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.462
You're a crazy person.

04:21.554 --> 04:23.169
Or a liar. Or both.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.879
I prefer dashing rapscallion.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.971
Scoundrel?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.924
Give me one good reason
not to punch you in the face.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.884
You really don't believe me?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.851
Try using your superpower.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.191
Yep, I know about that.

04:38.863 --> 04:41.696
Use it. See that I'm telling the truth.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.240
Just because you believe something
is true does not make it real.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.283
Maybe, maybe not.
But I know you, Swan.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.615
You sense something is off.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.245
Go to that address. Take a chance.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.418
Then you'll want to talk.
And when you do, I'll be in Central Park.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.917
By the entrance of the zoo.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.635
Don't do it for me. Or you.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.383
Do it for your family.
They need your help.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.894
How have things been since we left?
The Ogres.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.100
Oh, defeated.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.773
We are restoring
our kingdom and our lives.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.071
And congratulations.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.608
(LAUGHING) Is it that obvious?

05:26.744 --> 05:28.405
SNOW WHITE: You're glowing.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.487
Why is she pregnant and
I'm the one who's sick?

05:30.581 --> 05:31.616
We have much to celebrate.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.831
And know that you and your friends
are welcome in our kingdom.

05:33.918 --> 05:35.624
If you need anything,
we are at your service.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.835
Thank you. But all we need is horses.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.787
We have our own kingdom,
our own castle...

05:39.924 --> 05:41.505
Our castle was destroyed in the curse.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.174
Well played, Your Majesty.
You laid waste to everything.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.173
Not everything. Her castle still stands.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.721
Of course it does. I protected it.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.265
Well, technically,
the castle doesn't belong to her.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.593
It was Snow's before she took it.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.929
Well, to be fair, I married into it.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.184
That you did.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.816
And now we're taking it back.

06:02.947 --> 06:04.812
And you are coming with us.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.193
(SCOFFS) You can't be serious.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.651
Regina, everyone out there is
scared and confused. They need hope.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.325
What better way to do that than
to return united?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.243
You're coming with us.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.950
I know you don't like it. You'll learn to.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.036
For our good. For yours.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.923
Thank you again for the hospitality.
We should begin preparations.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.965
Good luck to all of you.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.056
You know we can't pretend
this didn't happen.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.731
They've returned. We have to tell her.

06:41.819 --> 06:42.979
Aurora, we can't.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.311
You know what will happen to them.
What she'll do.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.068
We both know if she ever found out
we hid this,

06:49.159 --> 06:50.695
she would take it out on our child.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.864
We have no choice. She has to know.

06:52.997 --> 06:56.535
We have to trust that
they can take care of themselves.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.999
It is not up to us to save them.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.504
WALSH: Hey, what's that?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.048
Nothing.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.501
Hope you're still hungry.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.712
Oh, Walsh, I couldn't eat another bite.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.342
You remember our first date?

07:14.059 --> 07:17.597
You were being you, (CHUCKLING)
so I couldn't swing a dinner.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.973
I brought you here for lunch.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.931
Which didn't stop you from
ordering an ice cream sundae,

07:22.026 --> 07:23.391
which wasn't on the menu.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.142
l bribed the chef, they made one up.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.979
I remember. lwas nervous.
Now, I'm full.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.281
Will you at least look at it?

07:35.456 --> 07:39.119
Emma, I don't wanna freak you out,
but I couldn't wait any longer.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.710
I love you.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.410
I love Henry. I love our lives together,

07:43.547 --> 07:45.879
and I wanna have a future together.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.971
Emma Swan,

07:55.392 --> 07:56.893
will you marry me?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.446
Here I thought the worst thing that
could happen was you'd say "no."

08:11.575 --> 08:13.076
I never thought
you'd walk out on the bill.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.071
-Walsh...
-No, no, no. lwas gonna pay. lwas...

08:15.162 --> 08:16.197
I'm kidding.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.574
I'm sorry. This wasn't...

08:19.500 --> 08:22.287
You just took me by surprise, is all.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.410
A lot of things
took me by surprise tonight.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.541
Look, surprise was
kind of part of the plan.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.964
But I can see now,
it was not a great plan. So...

08:29.051 --> 08:30.837
Doesn't it all just
seem a little fast to you?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.418
I mean, we've only been
together eight months.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.004
I've had leftovers in my fridge
for longer than that.

08:35.099 --> 08:38.591
I know. I threw them out.
Might've saved your life. (CHUCKLES)

08:38.894 --> 08:40.976
How do you, we,

08:42.731 --> 08:44.471
know that this is right?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.140
Emma,

08:47.194 --> 08:48.309
speaking for myself,

08:48.404 --> 08:49.940
I've known this was right

08:50.030 --> 08:52.692
since the moment
you walked into my furniture shop.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.240
Why do you think
your order was ready two weeks early?

08:55.327 --> 08:56.988
-Your commitment to excellence?
-(CHUCKLES)

08:57.079 --> 08:58.865
I couldn't wait to ask you out.

08:58.956 --> 08:59.945
(LAUGHS)

09:00.040 --> 09:02.497
It seemed the most non-stalkery way
to speed things up.

09:03.419 --> 09:04.829
I love that end table.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.161
That's a start.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.542
I do love you. You know that, right?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.375
Yeah, I do. And I love you.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.050
I'm not good at fast.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.382
-I know.
-(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

09:19.476 --> 09:22.889
I knew who I was proposing to.
I knew you would say this was too fast.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.312
And that's why we don't have to
get married anytime soon.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.981
We can wait a year. Or more.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.186
Look, I don't care if we don't get married
until we are 65 years old,

09:32.322 --> 09:35.109
and Henry already has kids. Okay?

09:35.200 --> 09:39.910
All I know is that I wanna
spend the rest of my life with you.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.785
Can I have some time to think?

09:43.876 --> 09:46.367
Take as much time as you need.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.834
I will be here when you're ready.

Mrs. Cuse said you were quiet tonight.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.483
Not quiet. Concentrating.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.189
I finally reached level 23.

10:20.579 --> 10:23.070
You mind
if a fifth-level wizard joins you?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.792
At level 23? Good luck with that.

To Walsh.

You knew? How?

10:38.388 --> 10:42.301
Come on, Mom. Your first date
restaurant. Special night out.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.519
Writing was on the wall.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.185
Technically, the writing
was in the dessert.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.887
So, what did you say?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.231
Poor guy.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.559
I didn't say "no."

10:53.654 --> 10:56.191
Well, if you didn't say "yes,"
I stand by my "poor guy" assessment.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.442
I just need some time to think about it.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.736
I mean, it's like a big step, kid.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.281
We've got a good thing going here,
just the two of us.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.622
Yeah, and we'd still have a good thing
if it was just the three of us.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.331
You think Walsh is worthy
ofjoining our little family?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.503
He's okay.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.469
Not every guy is just gonna leave you.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.933
He didn'tjust leave.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.931
He set me up to take the fall
for his crime, and left me in jail.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.358
He doesn't even know you exist.
He doesn't deserve to.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.185
And this guy is not that guy.

11:37.823 --> 11:40.030
He wants to be with you. Us.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.991
He wants this to be his home.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.860
And anyways, I know you like him.

'Cause he's the first guy you've dated
I've ever met.

50 more Storybrooke folk
landed not two miles from here.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.043
They're popping back all over the place.

12:35.172 --> 12:38.380
That's good. At this rate, we'll have
the whole kingdom back in no time.

spread the word,

about preparation and all that.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.271
There's no need to overload your horse.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.441
The Queen's castle
is less than a day's ride from here.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.063
And we'll have everything we need
once we get there.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.696
Aye. Well, that would be lovely,
if I were going to the Queen's castle.

(SIGHS) Hook, you don't even know
if it's out there...

13:18.340 --> 13:21.548
Regina told me how
this bloody thing worked.

13:21.635 --> 13:25.093
That it returned all our belongings
to this land, as well as us.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.468
That means that somewhere out there is
my ship. All I have to do is find her.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.547
And what if you can't?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.806
I'll just have to
take another one then, won't I?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.102
That's what pirates do.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.522
Huh. And here I'd thought
you'd gone and changed.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.649
I tried the hero thing. It didn't take.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.196

13:45.283 --> 13:47.945

go back to being a pirate?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.572
Back, my lady?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.370
I've always been a pirate.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.286

14:02.259 --> 14:04.921
What Hook said just now, about all
of our stuff being brought back here,

14:05.012 --> 14:06.001
that true?

14:07.431 --> 14:08.716
What are you looking for?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.763
I was thinking, maybe we could
stop by my father's place

14:10.851 --> 14:12.261
on the way to the Queen's castle.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.014
Neal, I know you're hurting,

14:15.105 --> 14:17.642
but Rumplestiltskin is gone.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.598
Maybe. Maybe not.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.563
And if he's not,
maybe he can get me back to Emma.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.689

14:25.032 --> 14:26.613
it's impossible.

14:27.242 --> 14:31.531
Regina was clear the price of our return
was a complete reset.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.286
No more portals.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.534
This is our realm for good.

There's no way to cross over,
not without another curse.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.291
We have to move on.
This is our home now.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.294
Now, I know you miss them. So do we.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.297
But even if there were some way to get
to them, they wouldn't remember us.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.255
The best thing we can do
for Emma and Henry

14:51.683 --> 14:53.799
is the only thing we can do.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.058
Let them be.

you're going to marry him?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.190
Uh...

25:36.285 --> 25:38.662
So that's a "yes."
How are you gonna tell him?

25:38.788 --> 25:40.904
Wait. Wait. First, I didn't say that I...

25:40.998 --> 25:42.454
You can tell him at dinner tonight.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.619
We're not having dinner.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.418
I might have sent him a text
from your phone this morning.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.120
He's coming over at 8:00.

25:49.215 --> 25:53.379
And I arranged to sleep over at Avery's
so the two of you could be alone.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.554
It's okay, Mom.

25:55.638 --> 25:59.506
If your gut's telling you to marry him,
trust it.

26:03.646 --> 26:06.353
Crap. I forgot to pick something up.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.143
Here. Take this,

26:09.485 --> 26:13.228
go see if you can beat level 24.
I'll meet you up there.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.567

EMMA: Hey,

26:41.726 --> 26:42.886
we need to talk.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.352
Ah, Swan. I knew you wouldn't
let me rot in that cage.

26:46.439 --> 26:50.102
I've been in my fair share of brigs,
but none as barbaric as that.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.058
They force fed me
something called bologna.

26:52.695 --> 26:53.855
What the hell are these?

26:55.198 --> 26:57.189
We never lived
in a town called Storybrooke.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.819
We never took a flight
from Boston to New York.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.070
We never did any of this.

27:00.161 --> 27:01.571
So you believe me then?

27:01.662 --> 27:03.243
I don't know. You could have
photoshopped these pictures.

27:03.331 --> 27:04.366
Photoshopped?

27:04.624 --> 27:06.114
Faked.

27:06.209 --> 27:09.542
If you think these are forgeries,
why did you spring me from the brig?

27:10.046 --> 27:11.126
Because as much as you deny it,

27:11.214 --> 27:12.454
deep down,
you know something's wrong.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.925
Deep down, you know I'm right.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.625
It's not possible.
How could I forget all of this?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.005
I promise you there's an explanation.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.132
Not one that makes sense.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.137
If you drink this, it Will.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.435
If...

27:29.941 --> 27:32.307
If what you're saying is true,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.651
I'd have to give up my life here.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.858
It's all based on lies.

27:37.949 --> 27:40.611
It's real. And it's pretty good.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.736
I have Henry, ajob, a guy I love.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.366
Perhaps there's a man that you love
in the life that you've lost.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.170
Regardless,
if you want to find the truth, drink up.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.215
Do you really want to live a life of lies?

27:57.301 --> 27:58.381
You know this isn't right.

27:58.469 --> 28:01.461
Trust your gut, Swan.
It will tell you what to do.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.841
Henry always says that.

28:03.933 --> 28:07.175
Then if you won't listen to me,
then listen to your boy.

she once treated a poor thief
far better than I deserved.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.624
She does that a lot.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.243
And what of you? What of yourjourney?

29:16.881 --> 29:18.621
Were you able to
find your son in Neverland?

29:19.008 --> 29:20.373
Yes, thank you.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.584
I don't mean to pry,
but I don't see the boy.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.386
It's complicated. But...

29:25.890 --> 29:27.426
He's safe, he's with his mother.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.648
So what do you think of our new friend?

29:35.232 --> 29:37.814
Can we trust him? He is a thief.

29:39.570 --> 29:43.233
Think of it from his perspective.
How do you think he looks at you?

-Point taken.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.014
(CRACKUNG)

30:16.732 --> 30:18.268
A protection spell.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.982
The entire castle's encircled by it.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.603
Didn't you do this? Undo it.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.741
Well, don't you think if I could,
I'd be halfway home by now?

30:28.828 --> 30:32.036
No. Someone hijacked it.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.205
Who? Who's in there?

30:34.291 --> 30:38.034
I don't know. But I'm gonna find out
whoever's eating my porridge.

30:38.129 --> 30:41.747
Nobody sits in my chair.
Nobody takes our castle.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.082
Hey. We've got a lot of people
looking to us.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.134
They're scared, and rightfully so.
Let's get them to safety first.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.382
They'll be safe when
whoever's in there is dead.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.840
Rushing in there is a bad plan, Regina.
You know that.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.726
I can offer safe harbor
in Shen/vood Forest.

30:55.813 --> 30:56.848
It's not far.

30:56.939 --> 31:00.397
We can offer food, shelter, a thick
canopy no creature will spy you under.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.894
Do you have weapons?

31:01.986 --> 31:03.192
We're lousy with them.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.644
Fine. Lead the way.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.149
But we're coming back.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.901
And whoever did this

31:08.826 --> 31:10.066
is going to suffer.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.026

I had a life to get back to. A pirate's life.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.793
Glad to see you haven't changed.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.509
There wasn't anything for me
in the enchanted forest.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.013
Why would I stay?

31:40.107 --> 31:41.688
And all was well,

31:41.776 --> 31:43.641
until I got a message.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.439
A message saying that
there was a new curse.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.820
And that everyone had been
returned to Storybrooke.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.444
The message told me

31:51.160 --> 31:53.697
that the only hope was you.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.530
You came all the way back here
to save my family?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.286
I came back to save you.

32:05.508 --> 32:06.623

to reach into this world.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.424
Any more specific thoughts?

32:12.515 --> 32:15.006
Alas, you're the Savior. Not me.

A mother.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.232
and started poking holes
in everything I thought was real.

it was like waking up from a dream.

Well, you have
what matters most, your son.

32:37.248 --> 32:39.239
And now I have to figure out
how to explain this to him.

Alas, I could only scavenge together
enough for one dose of memory potion.

what I'm going to tell him.

you said it was just you and Henry,
this was your home.

for you to understand.

Henry's father.

34:29.652 --> 34:30.767
Another ex?

34:30.861 --> 34:32.977
It's nothing like that. He's

38:29.057 --> 38:31.013
Henry, lend him a hand.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.807
Wait, (STAMMERS) we're really going?

38:34.563 --> 38:35.643
Yes.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.560
Ijust need one last thing.

38:56.960 --> 38:57.949
(INSECTS CHIRPING)

39:19.483 --> 39:20.472
(SIGHS)

39:22.611 --> 39:24.101
It's really back.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.112
I'm really back.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.572
As quaint and homey
as you remember?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.275
As cursed as I remember.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.400
(SIGHS)

39:34.248 --> 39:35.237
(CLINKS)

39:36.833 --> 39:39.119
That's more like it, isn't it, Swan?

39:39.211 --> 39:40.326
How are you gonna explain that to him?

39:40.462 --> 39:42.373
Well, that's more your concern.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.079
Or perhaps it'll jog his memory.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.960
Or give him nightmares.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.377
Last time, this curse
took away everyone's memories.

39:49.471 --> 39:50.506
This time?

39:50.639 --> 39:51.799
We don't know what it did.

39:52.474 --> 39:53.554
Then I'll find out.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.302
Stay here and watch Henry.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.431
Don't wake him, or scare him,
orjust... Let him sleep.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.513
Aye. Where are you going?

40:02.359 --> 40:03.644
To talk to my parents.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.916
Hi.

40:23.672 --> 40:26.414
Don't close the door. My... My name is...

40:26.508 --> 40:27.714
Emma.

40:27.843 --> 40:29.174
David?

40:32.014 --> 40:33.174
You remember.

40:34.725 --> 40:35.760
You remember.

40:36.852 --> 40:39.343
Of course.
What are you doing here? Where...

40:39.438 --> 40:40.644
Well, Hook found me.

40:40.731 --> 40:42.346
He brought me here,
he said you were cursed.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.608
Yeah. We're back.
Or we never left. Or...

40:47.279 --> 40:50.021
Well, we don't know.
But we're trapped again.

40:50.532 --> 40:51.521
But you know who you are.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.734
Emma, this curse...
We don't know who did it or why.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.531
All we know is our last year,
it's been wiped away.

40:56.622 --> 40:57.782
Wiped away?

40:57.873 --> 41:00.831
All we remember
is saying goodbye to you.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.782
Feels like yesterday.

41:02.878 --> 41:06.587
But if you can't remember,
then how do you know that it's been a...

41:06.715 --> 41:07.955
MARY: Emma?

41:08.467 --> 41:09.547
Emma.

41:11.053 --> 41:12.384
...year?

41:14.139 --> 41:15.128
(INHALES SHARPLY)

41:16.892 --> 41:20.100
As you can see, a lot's happened.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.775
(CHUCKLES) We just don't know what.
The whole year is gone.

41:29.571 --> 41:32.233
Who the hell would've done this?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.612
Did you get what I need?

41:40.707 --> 41:41.696
(HOOTING)

41:43.126 --> 41:44.411
-Show me.
-(HOOTING)

41:46.755 --> 41:49.121
That's her blood? The Queen's?

41:49.216 --> 41:50.171
(SCREECHES)

41:50.258 --> 41:51.668
(CHUCKLES)

41:53.303 --> 41:54.679
Lovely.

41:57.474 --> 41:58.930
Now...

42:00.686 --> 42:02.927
Now I shall get my revenge.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.557
(SCREECHES)

42:04.648 --> 42:06.309
Of course I will.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.649
The Queen may be evil,

42:12.114 --> 42:13.445
but I'm wicked.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.114
And wicked always wins.
