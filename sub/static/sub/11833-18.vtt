WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.271
We have to make
the decision.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.673
What do you think?

00:06.707 --> 00:09.309
I think if we can get
manslaughter, we should take it.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.144
How much time
would I serve?

00:11.812 --> 00:14.047
Could be as little
as three years.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.782
I would-- I would think
at the most six.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.786
(sighs) Oh, God.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.789
My kids are 13 and 11.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.290
Six years...

00:24.324 --> 00:25.191
Here's the problem.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.760
Jury nullification
is risky.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.162
Technically, I'm not
even allowed to argue it.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.297
What about insanity?

00:31.331 --> 00:33.166
The problem there is

00:33.767 --> 00:36.469
your demeanor was calm
and deliberate at the time.

00:36.503 --> 00:39.472
Now, look, Helen Gamble
is a very good D. A.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.442
Also, on this issue,

00:42.475 --> 00:44.110
she's on a mission
with it.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.479
Her grandmother--
I don't know all the details--

00:46.513 --> 00:48.114
whether she was
euthanized somehow or--

00:48.148 --> 00:51.284
all I know is she goes
tough on mercy killings.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.486
This was an act
of compassion, for God's sake.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.589
You know that,
I know that,

00:55.622 --> 00:57.357
but if we can get
manslaughter,

00:57.390 --> 00:59.325
I think we should do it.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.563
I can't believe
they're pushing this.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.497
This is politics.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.601
You did shoot her
in the head.

01:10.236 --> 01:14.174
(music playing)

01:57.918 --> 01:59.252
I'm not offering
manslaughter.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.253
It's a mercy killing.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.021
It's a homicide.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.523
I'm agreeing to plead
to homicide.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.423
Not enough, you're not.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.625
What are you looking for,
a life sentence?

02:04.658 --> 02:05.692
This man is no criminal.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.293
I'm looking for more
than five years,

02:07.327 --> 02:09.729
which is what he would
probably do with manslaughter,

02:09.763 --> 02:11.164
and he is a criminal, Bobby.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.298
He committed
premeditated murder.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.868
What, I'm supposed to go light
because it came from love?

02:14.901 --> 02:16.302
A lot of homicides do.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.470
Listen to how angry
you're getting.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.573
I'll see you in there.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.341
Hey. Get some therapy.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.544
Take your hand
off me, please.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.681
I tried talking to her
last night.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.315
So, what do we do?

02:29.349 --> 02:31.718
I still wouldn't go insanity.
She'll pick us apart.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.620
Plus, it's pretty obvious
he knew what he was doing.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.488
So, what are we left with?

02:38.291 --> 02:39.359
Self-defense?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.360
It's viable.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.595
You want to argue

02:41.628 --> 02:44.565
he defended his wife
by shooting her in the head?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.266
I should at least
be allowed to argue it.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.801
Well, you won't be.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.270
I have to prevent the law
from being tortured here,

02:50.303 --> 02:51.137
and you won't--

02:51.171 --> 02:52.573
If you consider
the strict elements--

02:52.606 --> 02:54.841
you will not argue
he acted in self-defense.

02:54.875 --> 02:58.211
That's ridiculous.
What else?

02:58.244 --> 02:59.980
We'd ask the prosecution
to include manslaughter

03:00.013 --> 03:01.548
as a lesser included charge.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.817
It wasn't manslaughter.
It was premeditated, and--

03:03.850 --> 03:05.586
Question for the jury.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.253
The jury
doesn't get to decide

03:07.287 --> 03:08.755
what defendants
are charged with.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.490
The reason she won't
charge manslaughter is

03:10.524 --> 03:12.626
she's afraid that's what
the jury will come back with.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.596
I can't tell the prosecution
what to charge, counsel.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.462
Your Honor, I--

03:16.496 --> 03:17.831
Bobby.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.234
Let's go in.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.204
Ms. Gamble,
one second, please.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.442
As I've said,

03:29.475 --> 03:31.778
I can't tell you how
to prosecute your case,

03:31.812 --> 03:34.915
but it seems manslaughter
is a good result here.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.683
I don't agree.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.919
A jury could let him
go free.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.523
I'm aware of that possibility,
your Honor.

03:50.697 --> 03:51.565
May I help you?

03:52.365 --> 03:53.967
I'm Mary Donovan.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.669
I'm looking for
Bobby Donnell,

03:55.702 --> 03:57.504
Eugene Young,
or Ellenor Frutt.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.939
I'm Ellenor Frutt.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.809
Oh, hello. It's very nice
to meet you.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.777
You come highly recommended.

04:05.311 --> 04:08.314
I have $500. I'd like
to buy a day of your time.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.016
$500 will get you to lunch.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.986
Is there
something specific?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.989
My son-- he's in jail
for a crime he didn't commit.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.858
Ah, well--

04:19.325 --> 04:21.060
Yes, every mother thinks
her son is innocent.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.731
The distinction here--
Mine is.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.966
If I could just have
one day.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.769
If it's more than $500,
I can pay over time.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.638
Can you tell me the crime
your son's been convicted of?

04:31.838 --> 04:34.808
Murder. He's on death row
in Pennsylvania.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.943
The Governor
just signed his warrant.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.646
He's to be executed
in five weeks,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.582
so, time is of the essence.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.351
I'm told of your work
on the Randall Jefferson case...

04:45.385 --> 04:48.454
What you've accomplished
in just 24 hours...

04:49.022 --> 04:53.627
Mrs. Donovan, we were unable
to save Randall Jefferson...

04:55.095 --> 04:56.863
Please?

04:56.897 --> 04:59.633
I'm only asking
for one day.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.342
What do you do
as a hospice worker?

05:09.375 --> 05:10.677
It's much like that
of a nurse,

05:10.711 --> 05:12.979
though I work primarily
with dying patients,

05:13.013 --> 05:14.548
usually at their own homes.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.783
You worked for Scott Simpson,
the defendant?

05:16.917 --> 05:19.052
Yes. I looked
after his wife.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.655
She was suffering
from ovarian cancer.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.390
Mrs. Raymonds,
calling your attention

05:24.424 --> 05:27.628
to the evening
of December 5th of last year,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.029
do you recall what happened?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.664
She was in a lot of pain.

05:30.697 --> 05:31.832
Mrs. Simpson?

05:31.865 --> 05:32.833
Yes.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.468
We were giving her
increased dosages of morphine,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.437
but she was still in agony,

05:37.470 --> 05:40.040
and she was begging
that we let her die.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.676
Finally, Mr. Simpson--
he, um,

05:42.709 --> 05:45.746
he asked that I leave
the room, which I did.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.048
Then what happened?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.717
After about
two minutes or so,

05:50.751 --> 05:53.019
I heard a gunshot.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.623
Mr. Simpson then opened
the door,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.491
and he said
his wife was gone.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.129
You spoke of morphine.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.497
Actually, on the day
in question,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.533
you were using morphine
in conjunction

06:06.567 --> 06:08.401
with a benzodiazepine,
isn't that right?

06:08.434 --> 06:09.302
Yes.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.805
And this drug is
the equivalent of valium?

06:11.838 --> 06:13.607
It's very close, yes.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.076
And the purpose
of a morphine-valium cocktail

06:16.109 --> 06:18.545
is to hasten
the patient's death,

06:18.579 --> 06:19.813
isn't that right,
Mrs. Raymonds?

06:19.846 --> 06:21.815
It's primarily
to relieve pain.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.951
Mrs. Raymonds, I remind you
you're under oath.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.954
The morphine-valium
combination--

06:27.988 --> 06:31.725
that is used to cause
the patient's death. True?

06:32.826 --> 06:33.727
Yes.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.596
So, on the day in question,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.564
you were already acting
to hasten

06:37.598 --> 06:39.165
Mrs. Simpson's death,
weren't you?

06:40.166 --> 06:43.069
In conjunction
with the family's wishes,

06:43.103 --> 06:46.740
I was employing a method
of pain management

06:46.773 --> 06:49.676
that would most likely result
in the patient's death, yes.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.612
And no one charged you

06:51.645 --> 06:52.913
with attempted murder,
I assume.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.681
Objection.
Sustained.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.918
When Mr. Simpson
ended his wife's life,

06:58.585 --> 07:00.887
he did something
in seconds

07:00.921 --> 07:02.723
that you were basically
trying to do

07:02.756 --> 07:03.957
in a day or so.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.062
I can't disagree
with that.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.531
Thank you.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.970
He was only 19
at the time.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.872
He was convicted
of raping and killing

07:18.905 --> 07:24.477
his girlfriend Alisa Kearns,
then killing her mother.

07:24.511 --> 07:25.612
This is them.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.517
And this happened when?

07:30.551 --> 07:33.554
1988. He's been in prison
12 years.

07:35.589 --> 07:39.159
The evidence was one eyewitness
who placed him at the scene

07:39.192 --> 07:40.761
plus, a lying
jailhouse informant

07:40.794 --> 07:42.796
who made up a story
about Stuart confessing.

07:42.829 --> 07:43.697
He never did.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.632
And what's
your son's story?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.535
That he was out hunting,
and it's not a story.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.603
He was with my husband,

07:50.737 --> 07:52.539
who the police just thought
was trying to cover for him.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.175
My husband
has since passed away.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.643
Any DNA?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.546
Stuart's blood type
matched whoever did it.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.681
That's a problem.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.650
They didn't do
full DNA analysis back then.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.651
Never?

08:04.685 --> 08:07.554
In 1992,
we finally had it done.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.824
Unfortunately, the test
proved inconclusive.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.059
We went to try again
in '95.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.862
By then, the rape kit

08:15.896 --> 08:18.699
had either been lost
or destroyed.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.134
What's his appellate lawyer
telling you?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.804
That he's done
all that he can do.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.005
He's giving up.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.275
You took it?

08:29.309 --> 08:32.278
I agreed to meet with her son
and the D. A. if I can.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.212
In Pennsylvania?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.313
It's an hour
and a half flight.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.183
I'm there and back in a day,
and, you know, who knows?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.520
If he really is innocent...

08:40.153 --> 08:42.856
Well, God bless you, Ellenor.
If I had your heart...

08:42.889 --> 08:44.057
You'd have a heart.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.892
Oh, funny.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.960
Okay, look,
can I ask you something?

08:46.993 --> 08:52.566
And I am not trying to pick
a fight here, I promise.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.100
Why not plead out
on manslaughter?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.902
Grieving husband,
and I don't believe

08:55.936 --> 08:57.904
you really believe this guy
is a danger to society.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.205
He does time.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.941
He shot her in the head.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.910
Is it the method, then?
The fact that he used a gun?

09:05.011 --> 09:06.680
Partly, yes.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.249
So, if he used a needle
and injected her

09:09.282 --> 09:10.684
with something
to put her to sleep,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.085
then you'd agree
to manslaughter?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.657
No. Seems even less
like manslaughter.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.058
You put dogs to sleep,
not people.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.360
Okay, so agreed,
it's a crime,

09:20.393 --> 09:23.163
but my question goes
to why murder two?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
Why not manslaughter?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.198
Let me ask you
a question.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.068
You're against
the death penalty.

09:28.101 --> 09:28.869
You say it's barbaric.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.871
It's okay to put
sick people to death

09:30.904 --> 09:31.738
but not convicted murderers?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.840
No, those are two
very different things.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.610
No, they're not.
Lethal injections in both cases.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.745
Look, there is
a very big difference

09:38.779 --> 09:40.380
between executing
a healthy person

09:40.413 --> 09:42.916
and allowing a terminal one
in pain to die.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.085
Mrs. Simpson
wasn't allowed to die.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.720
She had a bullet
pumped into her head.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.054
She wanted to die.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.357
Oh, is that the test--
whether she wants to die?

09:51.391 --> 09:52.893
'cause a lot of inmates
on death row--

09:52.926 --> 09:55.161
they want to die.
You support killing them?

09:55.195 --> 09:58.198
I am talking about
a dying woman in extreme pain,

09:58.231 --> 09:59.032
not a healthy person.
Oh, please don't
shake your fork at me.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.634
What about the guy
with the brain tumor

10:00.667 --> 10:02.402
who's got four
to six months to live?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.070
He's not suffering,
but he doesn't want it

10:04.104 --> 10:06.740
to ever get to that point,
so he'd rather die now.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.941
Is it okay
to kill him if he wants?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.275
Well, I think we need
to re-evaluate--

10:09.309 --> 10:10.443
How about the ones
with six months to live?

10:10.476 --> 10:11.945
I am not saying it's okay
to kill anybody. I'm only--

10:11.978 --> 10:13.714
Okay, well, fine.
You know what?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.315
You make a list
of who it's okay to kill

10:15.348 --> 10:16.316
and who it's not,
all right?

10:16.349 --> 10:18.251
Helen, stop it.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.120
This woman
was in extreme agony.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.823
Her husband was trying
to spare her some suffering,

10:22.856 --> 10:24.691
and you go after him
like he's some monster.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.993
I'm supposed to listen to you
on who's a sympathetic defendant

10:27.027 --> 10:28.795
and who's not?
Come on.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.997
Forgive me if I don't
trust your damn judgment,

10:31.031 --> 10:33.767
and thank you for allowing me
to enjoy my supper.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.208
I was just
making conversation.

10:47.213 --> 10:52.753
The last week she'd been
in unbearable pain.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.958
She was tough, Sally.

10:57.991 --> 11:02.362
She'd endured a year of massive
chemotherapy treatments.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.999
Let's talk about
the very last day.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.235
She just couldn't
take it anymore.

11:09.269 --> 11:15.208
We then started the morphine
with the valium.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.111
Mrs. Raymonds said
she'd probably go into a coma

11:18.144 --> 11:20.113
and die in a day or two,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.716
but the pain
wouldn't go away.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.251
What did you do?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.823
I asked Mrs. Raymonds
to increase the morphine.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.792
She said she didn't want
to throw her into seizures,

11:31.825 --> 11:35.461
that that would be
more pain.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.164
So, I asked her
to leave the room.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.466
And then what happened?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.736
I went to my closet,

11:42.769 --> 11:45.238
retrieved my revolver
from the safe...

11:48.074 --> 11:50.343
and...

11:50.376 --> 11:51.244
I, uh...

11:54.815 --> 11:55.782
ended it.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.923
She would've likely
been dead in a day.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.827
I wasn't going to
let her suffer

12:06.860 --> 12:08.494
for another second.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.297
For two years,

12:11.331 --> 12:16.102
they cut out
half her insides,

12:16.136 --> 12:17.437
filled her
with chemicals,

12:17.470 --> 12:20.040
and the pain--

12:20.974 --> 12:23.109
Not another minute,

12:24.210 --> 12:26.312
not another second.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.249
Not another second!

13:16.129 --> 13:16.963
Hi, baby.

13:16.997 --> 13:17.731
Hey, mom.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.967
This is Ellenor Frutt.
My son Stuart.

13:21.001 --> 13:21.935
Hello.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.136
She says you can do something.
Can you really?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.839
I don't know, Stuart.
I have a few meetings set up,

13:25.872 --> 13:27.874
and then maybe
I'll have a better idea.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.309
What about
this Bobby Donnell guy?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.310
Is he coming, too?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.245
He's in trial right now,
so, he couldn't make it.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.549
But she's very good, Stuart.
I checked her out plenty.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.218
Um, actually, I have a meeting
with the district attorney

13:38.251 --> 13:41.054
in a little over an hour.
So, I read your statements,

13:41.087 --> 13:42.989
but I'd like to hear in person
your account of things.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.393
Okay. It's pretty simple.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.596
I was there that day
because I needed to see her.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.097
Why?

13:51.131 --> 13:52.599
we'd argued
earlier that week.

13:52.633 --> 13:55.135
She wasn't returning
my calls.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.605
She said we needed to take
a break, so I left.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.542
That night,
I went hunting with my dad.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.409
The next day,
the police showed up.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.879
Did you make love
to Alisa that afternoon?

14:06.412 --> 14:07.447
No.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.415
And did you see
her mother?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.518
Not that day.

14:13.587 --> 14:16.957
(Ellenor writing notes)

14:17.924 --> 14:19.459
Do we have a chance?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.036
When a patient reaches
stage four of ovarian cancer,

14:30.070 --> 14:31.171
it's pretty bleak.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.206
The odds of survival
are tougher, yes.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.108
But you were generally
encouraging

14:35.141 --> 14:36.409
to Mrs. Simpson,
weren't you, doctor?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.911
I don't know
if I was optimistic.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.179
But you certainly
held out the hope

14:39.212 --> 14:41.081
that the chemo treatments,
her pushing fluids,

14:41.114 --> 14:43.249
plus the two surgeries
to debulk the cancer--

14:43.283 --> 14:44.217
It could maybe save her?

14:44.618 --> 14:45.986
That was her best chance.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.322
But there never was
any real chance

14:49.355 --> 14:51.958
of saving Mrs. Simpson's life,
was there, Dr. Shields?

14:52.358 --> 14:54.995
Objection.
Mrs. Simpson's oncologist

14:55.028 --> 14:56.563
has nothing to do
with what transpired.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.464
It is my contention
that this doctor

14:58.498 --> 15:00.300
contributed
to Mrs. Simpson's suffering.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.636
Hold on here.
That goes to my client's
state of mind.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.205
Scott Simpson was
the only one to help his wife.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.640
The doctors weren't there
in the end.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.409
This witness is not relevant
to the issue before this court.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.644
I will show relevance.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.514
You are shut down here.
Step down, doctor.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.616
Call your next witness.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.653
The defense calls
Dr. Alan Price.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.687
Objection.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.655
Step up.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.329
Offer of proof.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.633
Dr. price is the surgeon who did
the debulking procedures.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.602
Denied. This witness
is not relevant.
Your Honor.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.337
I would remind counsel

15:37.370 --> 15:39.305
that it is your client
who is on trial here,

15:39.339 --> 15:41.241
not the doctors
who treated his wife.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.277
My client should be allowed
to put on a defense.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.647
You're not putting on
this one.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.714
Who else have you got?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.283
Defense rests, your Honor.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.387
Defense rests.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.529
As I've told
Mrs. Donovan,

16:02.563 --> 16:04.264
we don't know what became
of the rape kit.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.732
Oh, please.

16:05.766 --> 16:07.734
Do you know where
it could have become lost?

16:07.768 --> 16:10.036
It should be
in the police evidence room.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.673
If not there,
I'd try the lab. Barring that--

16:12.706 --> 16:14.007
Why aren't you trying?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.042
Why are you just
so blasÃ© about--

16:16.076 --> 16:18.779
Mrs. Donovan, I was kind enough
to grant you this meeting.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.413
You were kind enough

16:20.446 --> 16:23.283
to prosecute and convict my son
of a crime he didn't commit.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.317
I'm not going
to entertain this.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.419
All right, all right.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.922
Would you support me
in my efforts

16:28.955 --> 16:31.525
to try to determine where
the rape kit could have gone?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.294
Of course. We're not trying
to hide anything here.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.028
Thank you.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.997
But, Ms. Frutt,
let's be clear.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.633
While I support your efforts
to retrieve lost evidence,

16:39.666 --> 16:43.403
I totally oppose the idea
of this case being reopened.

16:43.436 --> 16:47.107
Mr. Donovan was rightly
convicted of a double homicide.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.341
He did not commit
that crime.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.676
All right.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.080
I appreciate you
making the call.

16:54.615 --> 16:55.481
Mary?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.418
Let's go.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.354
Look, Mary,
here's the deal.

17:01.387 --> 17:02.756
If we're going to make
any progress on this,

17:02.789 --> 17:03.790
we're going to need
a modicum

17:03.824 --> 17:05.526
of cooperation
from the police,

17:05.559 --> 17:06.527
and that's not
going to happen

17:06.560 --> 17:08.161
with you
antagonizing them.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.797
That man is never going
to help, and I'll tell you why.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.567
His boss is running
on a death penalty platform.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.236
Stuart's execution
is the first one scheduled

17:16.269 --> 17:17.604
in a year.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.106
Politics-wise,
they need this to happen.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.275
They very well could have
knowingly destroyed

17:22.308 --> 17:24.810
that rape kit,
and forgive my French,

17:24.845 --> 17:26.547
but that Mr. Platt
is an ass

17:26.579 --> 17:28.481
who's capable
of concealing evidence.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.652
Mary, I don't want you
to antagonize them.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.667
How's it going?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.071
(door slams)

17:51.237 --> 17:52.105
That well.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.240
He tried calling
the woman's doctors.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.141
Why?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.511
Good question.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.891
Since I'm second chair,

18:10.924 --> 18:14.394
I thought maybe you'd
let me in on the strategy.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.696
That strategy is simple.

18:15.729 --> 18:18.431
Scott Simpson endured
two years

18:18.464 --> 18:20.266
of watching
his wife suffer.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.836
What does that have to do with
the doctors who treated her?

18:22.869 --> 18:25.471
I was putting them in
to establish the suffering.

18:25.506 --> 18:27.874
No, you weren't, Bobby.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.777
You put Dr. Shields
up there to attack him.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.781
Helen isn't the only one
personalizing this.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.717
What's going on with you?

18:36.950 --> 18:40.587
Lindsay, we have
no defense, okay?

18:40.621 --> 18:41.421
I have to convey

18:41.454 --> 18:42.889
whatever Scott Simpson
went through,

18:42.923 --> 18:43.790
what his wife
went through.

18:43.824 --> 18:46.259
It's all about building up
enough sympathy

18:46.292 --> 18:49.429
so, the jury feels compelled
to ignore the law.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.498
If that's what
you were trying to do,

18:52.533 --> 18:54.300
then you went
way off course.

18:54.935 --> 18:56.402
Okay, look at me.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.406
You were saying how
the doctors

19:00.440 --> 19:01.341
weren't there in the end.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.610
Now, I know that--

19:05.311 --> 19:06.479
that you had to turn
the respirator off

19:06.513 --> 19:07.347
on your mother--

19:07.480 --> 19:09.850
It isn't about that.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.352
Why did it happen
like that?

19:13.854 --> 19:16.790
How was it that you
had to turn it off?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.333
Hospitals wouldn't
do it back then...

19:29.970 --> 19:32.673
At least the hospital
that she was in.

19:34.875 --> 19:39.379
It was, um, it was
a Catholic hospital.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.550
And they just left
the family alone

19:43.584 --> 19:45.251
with the patient.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.855
They showed us the button.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.558
Then the doctors,
the nurses--

19:51.592 --> 19:52.559
they all left the room,

19:52.593 --> 19:55.461
leaving just me
and my dad with...

19:56.630 --> 19:58.532
Why didn't your dad do it?

19:58.565 --> 20:00.601
He couldn't.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.402
My father--
he couldn't bring himself

20:02.435 --> 20:06.206
to hit that button,
even though he knew.

20:07.741 --> 20:09.610
So...

20:12.746 --> 20:18.685
he asked me
if I would do it.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.955
While those doctors
were outside comparing notes

20:21.988 --> 20:23.657
on how well
the patient tolerated

20:23.690 --> 20:26.993
this chemical
versus that one,

20:27.027 --> 20:31.532
a 15-year-old kid
was left inside...

20:35.435 --> 20:37.671
to turn off
his mother's respirator.

20:42.643 --> 20:43.944
And now you hate them.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.512
Yeah.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.915
Yeah, I do.

20:48.949 --> 20:50.283
Okay.

20:53.654 --> 20:56.022
But we've got
a murder trial here,

20:57.558 --> 20:59.593
and our client--

21:00.026 --> 21:02.829
he needs you
to try this case

21:02.863 --> 21:03.964
and this case alone.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.331
I'm doing that.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.567
No.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.335
You're not, Bobby.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.276
Maybe I should close.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.347
I'll close.

21:36.930 --> 21:37.798
Hey.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.933
Oh, don't you start.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.467
Saying "hey" is starting?

21:41.502 --> 21:42.435
It depends.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.605
Have you come to pick out
bridesmaid dresses?

21:50.076 --> 21:51.545
What, have you come
to distract me

21:51.578 --> 21:52.846
from working
on my closing?

21:54.114 --> 21:56.950
Helen, this case
can't be a situation

21:56.983 --> 21:57.718
where your office is

21:57.751 --> 22:00.420
pressuring you
to get a murder two.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.088
Why not take
the manslaughter?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.590
I don't know.

22:03.624 --> 22:04.490
What do you mean,
you don't know?

22:04.525 --> 22:05.826
That's not really
an answer.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.362
You could just plead out
if you want.

22:09.630 --> 22:11.598
Why not do it? Really?

22:13.634 --> 22:15.769
I don't know.

22:21.842 --> 22:23.443
This is where you keep
all the rape kits?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.546
Yes, ma'am,
some of the old ones.

22:25.579 --> 22:27.480
Well, going back how far?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.516
That I couldn't tell you.

22:30.651 --> 22:33.854
"Donovan, Stuart."

22:33.887 --> 22:36.657
This would be it.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.428
It's not in there.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.030
Well, we figured
it wouldn't be there.

22:44.064 --> 22:45.599
That would've been
a little too easy.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.168
So, if it's not here,

22:48.201 --> 22:49.703
where else
might it possibly be?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.404
I mean, how many different
people handle these kits?

22:51.437 --> 22:52.172
This is just storage.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.741
Chain of custody
is all documented.

22:54.775 --> 22:56.810
Went to the lab in '92.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.580
There's no documentation
that it ever came back.

22:59.613 --> 23:01.447
Well, could it
still be at the lab?

23:01.481 --> 23:02.849
They don't really have
storage capacity,

23:02.883 --> 23:04.851
plus we called.
They say they don't have it.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.420
That means
it's most likely destroyed.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.922
Okay, where is this lab?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.424
Address is on the paper.

23:11.457 --> 23:15.028
Okay. Thank you
very much, officer.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.705
It's the hypocrisy of it all
that gets me.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.809
We're already helping
patients die.

23:28.842 --> 23:32.112
We make
these morphine-valium cocktails,

23:32.145 --> 23:36.817
and in the end, it causes them
to go into a coma and die.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.853
Forget the crap
about pain management.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.956
That's just
a politically correct euphemism.

23:42.989 --> 23:47.093
It's to hasten
the patient's death.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.129
So, what are we talking about?

23:49.630 --> 23:51.231
The so-called victim
in this crime

23:51.264 --> 23:53.499
was going to die
within 48 hours.

23:53.634 --> 23:54.701
The so-called victim's death

23:54.735 --> 23:57.070
was already
being hastened medically,

23:57.103 --> 24:00.541
and my client
hastened it further,

24:00.574 --> 24:02.776
and he's on trial
for murder?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.077
That's a joke.

24:04.911 --> 24:08.649
We can't give them
a quick-acting drug

24:08.682 --> 24:11.084
because that would seem too much
like we're killing them.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.153
So, we give them
a slow-acting drug,

24:13.186 --> 24:14.555
let it take a day or so,

24:14.588 --> 24:16.957
and we call it
pain management.

24:16.990 --> 24:19.860
That's a joke,
and it would be funny

24:19.893 --> 24:20.861
if it weren't for the fact

24:20.894 --> 24:25.566
that the patient often
suffers excruciating agony

24:25.599 --> 24:26.733
in the meantime,

24:27.768 --> 24:31.037
which is exactly
what was happening in this case.

24:31.071 --> 24:33.840
Everybody in this room knows

24:33.874 --> 24:35.275
if the doctors
could have ended

24:35.308 --> 24:39.145
Sally Simpson's pain
quickly and mercifully,

24:39.179 --> 24:44.017
Scott Simpson would have never
picked up that gun.

24:44.618 --> 24:45.819
But here we are,

24:46.953 --> 24:50.190
trying to take away
his life,

24:50.791 --> 24:52.926
trying to take him
from his children,

24:52.959 --> 24:56.162
trying to brand him
a murderer.

24:58.965 --> 25:02.068
More than anything, the law
is supposed to protect

25:02.102 --> 25:04.037
the weakest members
of our society.

25:04.070 --> 25:08.074
The law wasn't there
in the end for Sally Simpson.

25:08.609 --> 25:10.811
The doctors weren't there
in the end.

25:11.645 --> 25:13.947
After they cut out
half her insides,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.583
pumping her full of drugs,
prolonging her pain,

25:16.617 --> 25:19.019
causing it,
they weren't there in the end.

25:19.052 --> 25:24.925
Only I-- my client
Scott Simpson--

25:26.827 --> 25:30.531
only he was there
in the end.

25:32.966 --> 25:37.547
And he ended
his wife's suffering.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.678
He didn't stop a life.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.681
He stopped pain.

25:50.784 --> 25:55.989
And they're asking you
to call him a murderer.

25:59.292 --> 26:00.193
HELEN: First,

26:00.226 --> 26:03.163
there's a difference,
ladies and gentlemen,

26:03.196 --> 26:06.633
between controlling pain
with a dosage of medicine

26:06.667 --> 26:08.869
that could foreseeably
cause death

26:08.902 --> 26:10.804
and simply killing someone.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.708
Maybe in the end it amounts
to a small distinction,

26:14.741 --> 26:15.709
but it is one.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.279
Doctors do not kill to kill,

26:19.312 --> 26:22.048
and even if they did,
as Mr. Donnell contends,

26:22.282 --> 26:24.217
it is still illegal.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.854
Second, the patient
was already dying.

26:27.888 --> 26:31.124
Mr. Simpson
just hastened it further.

26:31.725 --> 26:32.726
Please...

26:33.059 --> 26:34.828
where do we draw the line?

26:35.328 --> 26:37.197
Where do we say
death is so close,

26:37.230 --> 26:39.700
it becomes okay to kill?

26:40.734 --> 26:44.304
Certainly, if a prisoner
on death row

26:44.337 --> 26:47.908
was murdered the day before
his scheduled execution,

26:47.941 --> 26:50.010
we would hold
the killer accountable.

26:51.144 --> 26:52.012
Third...

26:53.680 --> 26:57.250
Mrs. Simpson was suffering.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.253
I certainly don't dispute that,

27:00.286 --> 27:04.925
but I definitely take issue
with the suggestion

27:04.958 --> 27:07.093
that when a person
is in enough misery,

27:07.127 --> 27:09.329
it becomes permissible
to take out a gun

27:09.362 --> 27:11.231
and shoot her in the head.

27:11.932 --> 27:13.900
Fourth, the law.

27:14.467 --> 27:17.704
When a person
intentionally takes the life

27:17.738 --> 27:20.373
of another human being,

27:20.406 --> 27:21.975
it's murder.

27:22.342 --> 27:25.812
He can be loving,
sympathetic,

27:25.846 --> 27:27.914
even heroic
if you're so inclined

27:27.948 --> 27:29.816
to find him that way.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.019
But if he intentionally
takes the life

27:33.053 --> 27:34.454
of another human being,

27:34.487 --> 27:38.091
absent self-defense
or diminished mental capacity,

27:38.124 --> 27:41.962
it's murder,
and that's what we have here.

27:43.096 --> 27:46.299
Now, the arguments about
the extenuating circumstances--

27:46.332 --> 27:49.736
take that up at sentencing
when it's time for leniency,

27:49.770 --> 27:53.707
but here the question is,
did he commit a crime?

27:55.441 --> 27:59.012
I suppose you could choose
to ignore your duty.

27:59.045 --> 28:02.783
You could do here
exactly what Mr. Simpson did

28:02.816 --> 28:04.785
and take the law
into your own hands.

28:05.519 --> 28:07.053
Would I understand? Yes.

28:07.087 --> 28:09.022
Would it make you popular
in the public's eye?

28:09.055 --> 28:09.856
I bet it would.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.392
Would it make you right?

28:14.227 --> 28:16.329
You know the answer to that.

28:23.403 --> 28:26.472
This isn't a forum
for policy,

28:26.507 --> 28:30.877
but since Mr. Donnell
argued it,

28:30.911 --> 28:31.978
I agree--

28:33.013 --> 28:37.918
The law is designed
to protect its weakest member.

28:37.951 --> 28:42.355
That would include the sick,
the aged, the dying.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.926
Just consider
the potential for abuse

28:46.359 --> 28:50.897
if we let ourselves
become open to the idea

28:51.798 --> 28:54.835
that sometimes it's okay
to take out a gun

28:54.868 --> 28:57.070
and put somebody down.

29:07.380 --> 29:08.982
Your Honor, chambers.

29:10.851 --> 29:12.152
What's up?

29:12.185 --> 29:13.453
I want you
to instruct the jury

29:13.486 --> 29:15.255
that a conviction
means a life sentence.

29:15.288 --> 29:16.089
What?

29:16.122 --> 29:17.157
She argued sentencing
in her closing.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.058
I did not!

29:18.091 --> 29:19.993
You said leniency,
then implied to the jury

29:20.026 --> 29:21.494
that you can be lenient
when that's not the case.

29:21.528 --> 29:23.363
A conviction on murder two
means life.

29:23.396 --> 29:24.497
What do you
want me to do?

29:24.531 --> 29:26.432
Tell them that.
He'd be looking at life.

29:26.466 --> 29:27.467
Forget it.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.535
You have no discretion

29:28.569 --> 29:30.904
to be lenient, and right now
the jury thinks you do.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.238
I think you're
overreacting.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.206
She knew
what she was doing.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.340
Don't be accusing me!

29:34.374 --> 29:35.909
It bordered
on prosecutorial misconduct.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.110
Hey, I stuck to the law,

29:37.143 --> 29:39.012
you argued
jury nullification.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.480
You cannot let
that jury deliberate

29:40.514 --> 29:41.414
under the false impression

29:41.447 --> 29:43.349
that my client
might get a lighter sentence.

29:43.383 --> 29:45.185
There will be no further
talk on sentencing.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.287
I'm certainly not going to
give an instruction on it.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.522
It was a deliberate act
of deception!

29:48.555 --> 29:49.856
It was not!

29:49.890 --> 29:50.557
You're a liar!

29:51.491 --> 29:52.358
Helen.

29:53.326 --> 29:55.395
I'll hold you both
in contempt.

29:58.599 --> 30:01.434
You want to fight the fight
in the courtroom, fine.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.237
I will not accept that kind
of personal attack.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.010
(door slams)

30:17.083 --> 30:18.852
You were totally
out of line.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.587
She said leniency.
You heard it.

30:20.621 --> 30:22.488
I'm talking about
calling her a liar.

30:23.423 --> 30:25.626
Bobby, the law is totally
on Helen's side here.

30:25.659 --> 30:26.459
I mean,
who's kidding who?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.529
Yes, she could
have gone manslaughter,

30:28.562 --> 30:29.963
which I think
she should have,

30:29.996 --> 30:31.965
but the facts
easily support
murder two.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.300
So, I would be
a murderer then?

30:34.334 --> 30:35.368
Is that
what you're saying?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.903
Of course
I'm not saying that.

30:39.039 --> 30:41.474
Is that
what's going on here?

30:42.576 --> 30:44.210
You're defending
yourself?

30:48.381 --> 30:49.850
Oh, my God...

30:52.185 --> 30:55.155
Have you been
carrying that around?

30:55.188 --> 30:55.989
You killed your mother?

30:56.022 --> 30:57.357
I don't think that.
You-- You said it.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.526
I didn't say it.
It came out of you.

31:01.094 --> 31:03.196
Bobby...

31:05.699 --> 31:07.100
Bobby.

31:14.508 --> 31:15.542
Look, I understand
your problem,

31:15.576 --> 31:18.344
but we send all samples back
to the evidence locker.

31:18.378 --> 31:19.913
We have very limited
storage capacity here.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.247
We don't hang on
to rape kits.

31:21.281 --> 31:22.415
But the police
don't have any record

31:22.448 --> 31:24.250
of you returning
the rape kit on Donovan.

31:24.284 --> 31:25.986
Well, we have a record
of sending it back to them.

31:26.019 --> 31:27.153
I can show it to you.
It's right here.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.154
Well, if you
wrote it down--

31:28.188 --> 31:28.955
Can you tell me

31:28.989 --> 31:31.257
who you used
as a messenger service?

31:31.291 --> 31:32.092
We don't use services.

31:32.125 --> 31:34.060
It presents
chain of custody problems.

31:34.094 --> 31:35.428
So, people here
would have delivered it

31:35.461 --> 31:36.462
directly to the police.

31:36.496 --> 31:37.497
Yes.

31:37.531 --> 31:39.966
So, basically, you're saying
it got lost there,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.401
they're saying
it got lost here.

31:41.434 --> 31:42.468
Well, if I were
a betting man,

31:42.503 --> 31:43.970
I'd say
it got lost there.

31:46.106 --> 31:49.142
Okay. Does Jack Semler
still work here?

31:49.175 --> 31:50.043
Who?

31:50.076 --> 31:51.144
Jack Semler...

31:51.177 --> 31:53.079
He was the technician who
did the testing back in '92.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.247
Can I see your paperwork?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.583
Yeah, sure.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.119
Yeah, there's been
a mistake here.

32:00.020 --> 32:00.687
What kind of mistake?

32:00.721 --> 32:02.322
We didn't do this testing.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.123
What?

32:03.156 --> 32:04.625
Jack Semler works
for a private lab

32:04.658 --> 32:07.393
we sometimes hire out
when we're swamped here.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.329
I think our records--

32:09.362 --> 32:11.264
they indicate we sent it
back to the police

32:11.297 --> 32:14.601
when we may have sent it
to Kendall Laboratories.

32:15.468 --> 32:16.570
Well, if we have it,

32:16.603 --> 32:18.304
this is the only place
it could be.

32:18.338 --> 32:19.506
How long do you keep
samples for?

32:20.140 --> 32:21.241
It varies.

32:21.274 --> 32:24.711
Let's see, Donovan,
Donovan...Donovan.

32:24.745 --> 32:25.579
First name?

32:25.612 --> 32:27.047
Stuart.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.048
1992?

32:28.081 --> 32:28.949
Yes.

32:30.651 --> 32:31.484
Nope.

32:31.518 --> 32:32.385
Nothing.

32:34.721 --> 32:36.156
Well, if you don't have it

32:36.189 --> 32:37.558
and it didn't make its way
back to the police,

32:37.591 --> 32:39.359
do you have any idea
where it could be?

32:39.660 --> 32:40.527
Sorry.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.129
Unless...

32:43.163 --> 32:44.464
What was
the victim's name?

32:44.497 --> 32:45.498
Kearns.

32:45.532 --> 32:46.600
Sometimes they screw up

32:46.633 --> 32:48.535
and store it
under the victim's name.

32:48.569 --> 32:51.738
Let's see, Kearns.
John, no.

32:51.772 --> 32:53.740
Steven...Alisa?

32:53.774 --> 32:55.075
Yes, that's it-- Alisa.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.242
32665.

32:56.276 --> 32:57.443
Yeah,
that's the file number.

32:58.545 --> 32:59.412
Huh.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.548
What "huh"?
What do you mean, huh?

33:02.482 --> 33:03.349
We've got it.

33:03.584 --> 33:04.518
You have it?

33:04.551 --> 33:05.418
Here it is.

33:16.763 --> 33:17.731
She's still there?

33:18.398 --> 33:19.666
They tracked down
the rape kit.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.701
She's still
in Philadelphia?

33:20.734 --> 33:23.537
Meeting with the D. A.,
asking for another DNA test.

33:23.570 --> 33:24.771
What if this one's
conclusive?

33:24.805 --> 33:25.872
She think about that?

33:25.906 --> 33:28.308
What's to lose? He's due
to be executed in five weeks.

33:29.309 --> 33:30.276
We getting paid for this?

33:30.476 --> 33:31.444
$500 cash.

33:31.812 --> 33:33.279
You know,
we should expand.

33:34.114 --> 33:35.315
What's up
with your case?

33:36.149 --> 33:37.684
Jury's still out.

33:38.451 --> 33:39.786
Anybody see Lindsay?

33:49.195 --> 33:51.397
Ahem.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.667
Lindsay, hey.

33:53.700 --> 33:54.735
Hi.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.572
Hey, uh...

33:58.605 --> 34:00.240
you know,
you're in a men's room.

34:00.273 --> 34:02.609
Oh, well, I hear unisex
is the new rage.

34:02.643 --> 34:03.510
(laughs)

34:04.410 --> 34:05.445
How's Bobby?

34:06.880 --> 34:08.248
Well...

34:08.748 --> 34:12.518
he's a little unsettled
at the moment.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.719
Oh, something wrong?

34:13.754 --> 34:15.188
You two aren't fighting,
are you?

34:15.221 --> 34:20.226
No, no,
we're not fighting.

34:20.260 --> 34:22.362
He thinks
he killed his mother.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.670
You two really need
to talk more.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.239
He thinks what?

34:37.578 --> 34:38.812
He killed his mother.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.617
The last day of her life...

34:45.752 --> 34:47.788
You two have never talked
about it?

34:50.591 --> 34:52.225
That's not something--

34:57.330 --> 35:00.701
That's not something
I can talk about.

35:04.905 --> 35:07.708
Well, your son needs to.

35:11.945 --> 35:14.581
I'm afraid I can't agree.

35:14.615 --> 35:16.817
You can't agree
to a DNA test?

35:16.850 --> 35:17.684
No.

35:17.718 --> 35:18.384
Why?

35:18.418 --> 35:20.386
Miss Frutt,
this case is over.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.922
It's been over
for 12 years.

35:21.955 --> 35:23.524
He's about
to be put to death.

35:23.557 --> 35:24.758
Are you saying
that we should go back

35:24.791 --> 35:25.859
and reopen an investigation

35:25.892 --> 35:28.562
simply because a sentence
is about to be carried out?

35:28.595 --> 35:29.730
You bastard.

35:29.763 --> 35:30.664
Mary.

35:32.365 --> 35:34.334
The DNA technology
has improved.

35:34.367 --> 35:36.670
It is possible that a new
test could exonerate--

35:36.703 --> 35:38.672
I couldn't reopen
even if I wanted to.

35:38.705 --> 35:40.541
This is new evidence.
Of course, you can.

35:40.574 --> 35:41.875
It isn't new evidence.

35:41.908 --> 35:43.610
We had the rape kit
at trial.

35:43.644 --> 35:46.513
Look, I understand there
might be political gain

35:46.547 --> 35:47.814
in seeing
this execution through--

35:47.848 --> 35:50.751
It isn't that, and I'm
offended at the accusation.

35:50.784 --> 35:52.619
You're offended
at the accusation?

35:52.653 --> 35:54.320
How about I might have
an innocent kid...

35:54.354 --> 35:55.188
He isn't.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.056
Set to be put to death,

35:56.089 --> 35:57.724
and all we're asking for
is a simple test

35:57.758 --> 35:59.492
to confirm that you've
got the right guy.

35:59.526 --> 36:01.261
It isn't that simple.

36:01.662 --> 36:05.431
You're in here asking that
we reopen an investigation.

36:05.465 --> 36:06.800
If we did that for you,

36:06.833 --> 36:09.235
every defense attorney
in town would be

36:09.269 --> 36:11.437
lining up outside my office
asking for the very same--

36:11.471 --> 36:13.439
I am the only
defense attorney

36:13.473 --> 36:15.609
with a client
slated for execution.

36:15.642 --> 36:18.378
The answer is no.

36:18.411 --> 36:19.613
Then we'll go to court.

36:19.980 --> 36:21.615
Do what you think
you must.

36:28.922 --> 36:29.856
The jury has asked

36:29.890 --> 36:32.626
whether they could
come back with manslaughter.

36:32.659 --> 36:33.927
What did you say?

36:36.763 --> 36:39.966
I told them no.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.968
It's murder one,

36:42.002 --> 36:43.804
murder two,

36:43.837 --> 36:45.338
or straight acquittal.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.977
It's poker time, folks.

36:52.546 --> 36:57.317
Obviously, they don't want
to convict on murder two,

36:57.350 --> 37:00.320
but they might be
more reluctant to set him free.

37:02.789 --> 37:04.290
Who's going to blink?

37:06.326 --> 37:08.562
I'm still willing
to take manslaughter.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.038
No.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.305
Helen.

37:20.841 --> 37:21.975
No.

37:26.947 --> 37:27.881
Helen.

37:28.682 --> 37:30.283
You're grabbing me again.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.285
I'm sorry
I called you a liar.

37:33.954 --> 37:34.821
Okay.

37:36.089 --> 37:37.858
You don't think
we can deal this?

37:38.525 --> 37:40.594
You know, Ellenor's been
asking me why I pushed this,

37:40.627 --> 37:43.296
Lindsay asked--
truth is, I don't know.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.498
I've been asking myself.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.968
What's the answer?

37:52.038 --> 37:53.073
We live in a country

37:53.106 --> 37:56.476
where people kill each other
a lot, mostly with guns,

37:56.510 --> 37:58.879
and whether I feel
for your client or not,

37:58.912 --> 38:00.380
and I do,

38:02.082 --> 38:05.318
the thought of expanding
the boundaries even--

38:05.351 --> 38:06.587
even microscopically,

38:06.620 --> 38:10.090
where it becomes excusable
to shoot somebody,

38:10.123 --> 38:11.491
I can't do it.

38:11.525 --> 38:12.926
It has to stay repugnant.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.897
Excusable is too short
of a leap to acceptable.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.967
I can't do it.

38:30.777 --> 38:33.346
All we're looking to do
is a simple DNA test

38:33.379 --> 38:34.848
to confirm whether
Stuart Donovan

38:34.881 --> 38:37.518
was, in fact, the man
who raped Alisa Kearns.

38:37.551 --> 38:39.886
My understanding is
we had a match.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.987
A blood type match,

38:41.021 --> 38:42.623
but that is
hardly conclusive.

38:42.656 --> 38:45.759
We also had an eyewitness,
plus his fingerprints.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.460
This isn't about that.

38:47.794 --> 38:49.329
Now, young lady,

38:49.563 --> 38:52.065
I was the trial judge
in this case.

38:52.098 --> 38:54.835
Now, if you're suggesting
that Mr. Donovan

38:54.868 --> 38:55.869
didn't get a fair trial...

38:55.902 --> 38:57.070
That is not my suggestion.

38:57.103 --> 38:58.071
To repeat,

38:58.104 --> 39:01.642
I am only asking that
you authorize a DNA test.

39:03.143 --> 39:04.344
Mr. Platt?

39:04.711 --> 39:06.713
Under Pennsylvania law,
new evidence

39:06.747 --> 39:09.516
must be introduced within
60 days of its discovery.

39:09.850 --> 39:12.118
The rape kit
is 12 years old.

39:12.152 --> 39:14.921
Defense had opportunity
to analyze it before trial.

39:14.955 --> 39:16.456
The technology is different.

39:16.489 --> 39:18.491
The new evidence
is not the rape kit.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.661
It would be the results
of the testing,

39:20.694 --> 39:22.596
so, the 60-day statute
of limitation

39:22.629 --> 39:23.797
hasn't even begun to toll.

39:23.830 --> 39:26.767
Analysis of evidence
is not new evidence.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.702
This is supposed
to be about the truth.

39:28.735 --> 39:31.572
One lousy test
brings us to the truth.

39:31.872 --> 39:35.742
Our judicial system
is a process, Miss Frutt.

39:35.776 --> 39:38.044
We have rules of procedure.

39:38.078 --> 39:40.180
New evidence is one thing,

39:40.213 --> 39:43.617
but the re-evaluation
of old evidence

39:43.650 --> 39:44.585
is quite another.

39:44.618 --> 39:45.519
Your Honor--

39:45.552 --> 39:46.653
The petition is denied.

39:46.687 --> 39:49.455
He is facing
a death penalty.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.825
We're adjourned.

40:03.904 --> 40:05.438
Where's my mother?

40:06.707 --> 40:08.875
She, uh...

40:08.909 --> 40:10.777
she's going to come by
a little later.

40:10.811 --> 40:13.046
She's off someplace
crying, huh?

40:13.947 --> 40:16.650
Well, she's upset, Stuart.

40:16.683 --> 40:20.821
She just doesn't know
when to quit, that's all.

40:23.089 --> 40:24.024
Well, I guess she and I

40:24.057 --> 40:25.826
have something
in common, then,

40:25.859 --> 40:27.427
because I'm not quitting.

40:29.162 --> 40:30.797
What are you
gonna do?

40:33.099 --> 40:35.035
I don't know,

40:35.068 --> 40:36.503
but I'm not going
to go back to Boston,

40:36.537 --> 40:38.872
I can tell you that.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.156
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has reached its verdict?

40:56.690 --> 40:57.357
We have.

40:58.024 --> 41:00.561
The defendant
will please rise.

41:04.698 --> 41:05.566
What say you?

41:07.634 --> 41:10.036
On Commonwealth
vs Scott Simpson,

41:10.637 --> 41:12.839
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

41:13.574 --> 41:16.843
we find the defendant
Scott Simpson

41:16.877 --> 41:17.744
not guilty.

41:19.980 --> 41:23.116
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

41:23.149 --> 41:25.652
we find the defendant
Scott Simpson...

41:27.087 --> 41:28.021
guilty.

41:28.254 --> 41:29.122
(gasps)

41:31.224 --> 41:32.225
Members of the jury,

41:32.258 --> 41:34.661
this completes your service.
The court thanks you.

41:35.996 --> 41:36.930
This matter is adjourned.

41:36.963 --> 41:39.666
Security will take
the defendant into custody.

41:40.033 --> 41:41.501
(pounds gavel)

41:57.117 --> 41:58.952
Aunt Laurie's going to take
you guys home, okay?

42:00.020 --> 42:02.222
And you'll stay with her
for a little while

42:02.255 --> 42:03.724
like we talked about.

42:04.257 --> 42:06.627
Everything's going
to be okay.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.028
They'll be okay, Scott.

42:08.061 --> 42:10.096
I'll call you tomorrow,
guys, okay?

42:10.664 --> 42:11.798
All right, dad.

42:11.832 --> 42:13.099
I love you.

42:17.170 --> 42:21.675
I'll go with the boys--
Take them home.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.544
Okay.

42:24.244 --> 42:25.712
You okay?

42:27.714 --> 42:29.249
Yeah.

43:19.365 --> 43:23.870
(music playing)

43:45.892 --> 43:46.893
You stinker!
