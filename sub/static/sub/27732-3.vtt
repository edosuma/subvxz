00:25.984 --> 00:28.653
In the Book of Judges,
chapter 16,

00:28.737 --> 00:31.281
Samson fell by the lust of his eyes,

00:31.865 --> 00:34.951
and so the Philistines
gouged his eyes out.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.495
We reap what we sow.

00:38.371 --> 00:44.002
In Numbers 32, it says,
"Be sure your sin will find you out."

00:45.170 --> 00:51.468
Somewhere, sometime,
every little sin and every big sin

00:51.551 --> 00:54.012
will find you out.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.891
"For it is time," the scripture says,
"to seek the Lord,

00:58.475 --> 01:02.645
that he may come
and rain righteousness upon you."

01:02.729 --> 01:06.649
Because, unless you are clothed
in the righteousness of God,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.444
you will never enter Heaven.

01:18.161 --> 01:23.666
4.

01:24.834 --> 01:29.714
"For an angel went down into the pool,
and troubled the water;

01:30.256 --> 01:33.009
whosoever then first stepped in

01:33.551 --> 01:38.473
was made whole
of whatsoever disease he had."

01:38.556 --> 01:39.641
Amen.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.103
We have among us today
two of our great patrons,

01:43.186 --> 01:48.024
Anderson and Eliza Schultz, who are
certainly leaving their mark for God,

01:48.108 --> 01:51.486
and to whom this church, this town,

01:51.569 --> 01:55.031
and, indeed,
this entire state owe gratitude.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.661
Thank you, Reverend. A wonderful sermon.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.081
I'm moved to share with the congregation,
if I may.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.165
Absolutely.

02:08.837 --> 02:14.259
The scripture says
we're to love our neighbor as ourselves.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.848
There was a time, not long ago,
when this town had become a neighborhood

02:19.931 --> 02:22.433
without becoming a brotherhood.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.478
But together...

02:26.437 --> 02:28.148
we found the truth.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.860
If we serve faithfully...

02:34.696 --> 02:36.823
we will reap rewards.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.450
Hallelujah!

02:46.040 --> 02:47.500
Thank you very much.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.755
We need our angel back in the choir.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.633
It isn't quite the same
without our Rebecca's voice.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.886
How's she feeling this morning?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.929
The new treatment
is taking some getting used to.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.890
Well, the side effects
can be very uncomfortable,

03:01.973 --> 03:04.100
but Dr. Scully has high hopes.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.061
It's a potentially
groundbreaking technique.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.480
Very positive results
coming out of Germany.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.441
We're both in your debt.

03:14.569 --> 03:19.824
I have become recently aware of a...
serious matter,

03:19.908 --> 03:22.577
one that threatens
everything that we hold dear.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.496
It's going to need
a special kind of attention.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.209
I welcome any opportunity
to prove my faith.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.253
I'll send someone along
with the details.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.340
In the meantime, just know that,
as in the Book of Daniel,

03:36.174 --> 03:38.468
one of ours has been thrown to the lions.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.513
Rebecca and the boys will be
well looked after while you're gone.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.334
How long will you be gone?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.087
Did I wake you?

04:15.505 --> 04:16.881
I'm so sorry.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.178
Can I get you something

04:22.262 --> 04:23.554
I need you.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.642
Where are you going this time?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.730
Jesus said, "When you give alms,

04:32.814 --> 04:35.149
do not let your left hand know
what your right is doing,

04:35.233 --> 04:37.527
so that your alms may be given in secret."

04:41.155 --> 04:43.283
I'll only be gone a couple of days.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.203
I love you.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.195
God damn it.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.449
That piss...

07:30.032 --> 07:32.034
gonna mix with the shit
that's about to rain down.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.578
How's the leg?

07:35.496 --> 07:37.415
Next time, I'll hit more than your hand.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.499
Yeah.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.627
You two married?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.964
Sure sound married.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.136
And, anyhow,
I went down to this seminar.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.346
"Weak Eye Theory," it was called.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.099
All about how everyone's
got one eye bigger than the other

07:55.183 --> 07:56.476
and how you gain advantage

07:56.559 --> 07:59.228
by looking your suspect
exclusively in their weak eye.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.856
They don't even know it's happening,

08:01.939 --> 08:04.275
but it's throwing them off.
Psychologically.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.610
-Impressive.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.571
Hey, you think you could get me a Coke?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.825
You got a dollar

08:13.367 --> 08:15.495
I'm not about to spend
my own money on a suspect.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.664
I'm not a suspect, I'm the victim.
Ask your boss.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.710
How about this?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.963
I will change your life for a dollar.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.925
-Change my life?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.385
See above the door over there?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.888
Now, where I come from,
you hang it the other way.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.057
See, you guys got it
all pointed down like that,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.518
and all the luck
just runs out of it, because...

08:39.310 --> 08:41.312
-gravity, right?
-Uh...

08:41.395 --> 08:44.315
Trust me. It's worth a buck. Come on.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.110
-I can get you a water.
-Ugh.

08:48.194 --> 08:52.698
Please, Deputy Ogden,
I need caffeine and sugar.

08:52.782 --> 08:57.370
I have been up all night,
taken prisoner, tied down, shot at,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.080
almost killed, arrested...

08:59.163 --> 09:01.457
We're not all highly trained like you are.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.126
And, you know, I mean,
when Child Services comes

09:04.210 --> 09:06.504
I should be able to tell them
that Larkville County at least

09:06.587 --> 09:09.340
cares about the nutritional needs
of its child victims, right?

09:09.423 --> 09:11.342
-All that I have is a five.
-Thank you.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.137
Hey, have they told you
what's going on here?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.431
Like, what did I get dragged into?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.433
When does it stop, Rachel?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.477
Or is it...

09:22.228 --> 09:24.814
Susan

09:26.357 --> 09:27.483
Or maybe Stephanie?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.193
Your prints came back.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.698
The same prints, but under more aliases
than Carter has pills.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.867
And no one seems to know
which is the real you.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.078
So I ain't buying this Pollyanna routine.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.290
Just tell us
what really happened out there.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.506
I did. I'm the victim here.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.635
Okay. Fine.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.055
I intended on treating you as a minor,
but since you won't be straight with me,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.558
I'll take the average age
of all your aliases and call you 18.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.143
-I'm 16.
-Throw her in the women's cell

10:02.226 --> 10:04.895
-with that hard-ass she came in with.
-No, no, no! You can't do that.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.733
Look, just please don't do that.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.235
Just give me one good reason.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.947
Because...

10:16.532 --> 10:17.742
she's trying to kill me.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.663
What about the guy?

10:23.372 --> 10:24.540
He...

10:26.500 --> 10:28.628
-He saved me.
-Saved you?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.506
What was all that crap
about him tying you to a bed?

10:34.091 --> 10:35.801
He did that, too.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.511
It's true.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.264
I mean, both things are true.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.101
Look, I'm serious. Sheriff, really...

10:44.644 --> 10:47.438
they're both crazy,
and I just happened to get in the way.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.609
Watch her.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.206
Ms. Marlena Olin.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.000
Last known address, Detroit.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.836
What bounced from your prints
almost broke our Internet.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.589
Former military.
Former security contractor.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.841
As were those four corpses at the motel.

11:16.884 --> 11:17.885
See?

11:18.427 --> 11:22.306
If it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.474
Makes sense.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.938
But you, Castiglione, you make no sense.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.899
No known address.
IAFIS came back with nothing.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.734
Youâ€™re a choirboy, apparently.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.820
But look at you.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.155
Look at what you did.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.534
Went through her little crew
like they were nothing.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.329
Weirder still, no record of you
in the military database.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.332
If I had to guess,

11:48.999 --> 11:50.960
I'd say you were a jarhead.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.839
Well, I hope you both
enjoy our sandwiches,

11:54.922 --> 11:57.633
because nobody's going anywhere
until I get the truth.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.429
Good speech, Sheriff.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.682
You know, little departments like yours
don't handle homicides.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.350
They bring in the state police.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.769
But you haven't made that call.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.147
Election year?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.107
Racking up votes by playing the hero?

12:14.442 --> 12:16.152
You let me out now,

12:16.235 --> 12:19.488
I'll tell my people not to permanently
erase your name from the ballot.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.412
Trouble's coming, Sheriff.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.459
Why is that, exactly?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.836
The people who paid her,
they're gonna want this cleaned up.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.504
They're gonna want it done quickly.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.716
Delayed gratification's good.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.385
It built the middle class.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.730
You're averaging
less than two hours.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.648
Yeah

12:55.232 --> 12:56.817
Hell of a nightlife up in here.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.403
First, you can say
what you're doing with the pills.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.781
The prescription's meant
to help you sleep.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.115
I take 'em.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.743
-You do?
-I take 'em, and then I flush 'em.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.369
Why?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.996
I don't need your help sleeping.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.748
I was trained to sleep anywhere.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.293
You were also trained
on how to avoid sleep.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.213
Why don't you want to sleep, Billy?

13:19.215 --> 13:21.300
Are you afraid to sleep
because of the nightmares?

13:26.138 --> 13:28.307
Our treatment plan for you is simple.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.270
Successfully exposing yourself
to the nightmares

13:33.354 --> 13:36.148
is the only way to control the nightmare.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.694
Do you mind if I take a look?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.239
Knock yourself out.

13:56.210 --> 14:01.799
Trying to fully recall a nightmare
is like pulling on a spiderweb.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.510
If you yank hard on it,
you're going to break it.

14:04.593 --> 14:08.138
But we're gently pulling
on that spiderweb.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.974
And once we've pulled it all out,

14:10.057 --> 14:12.101
you can leave
nightmare helplessness behind,

14:12.184 --> 14:14.353
and you can start to gain
a mastery over it.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.857
That's the point of this journal.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.651
What you write down
doesn't have to make sense.

14:20.734 --> 14:24.530
None of this shit makes any sense!
Why won't you help me?

14:26.574 --> 14:27.908
Billy, calm down.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.536
I know what we're talking about is scary.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.497
What the hell do you know

14:33.581 --> 14:35.708
With your goddamn
finger painting

14:35.791 --> 14:37.585
and your "Dear Diary" bullshit!

14:38.794 --> 14:41.005
You're agitated because you need sleep.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.423
Hey!

14:59.648 --> 15:02.109
Ahh!

15:30.763 --> 15:31.972
Dr. Dumont, hi.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.898
Attention, security.
Initiate lockdown.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.025
North wing, fourth floor.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.571
-We're on our way right now.
-Let's go. Let's go.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.621
Why didn't you scream

15:55.704 --> 15:57.289
I don't want you to get hurt.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.000
Billy, you're not ready
to be on your own. Okay?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.251
You can trust me.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.836
It's not too late to put this right.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.546
We can do that, you and I.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.176
There's no putting this right.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.222
Billy...

16:15.182 --> 16:16.266
Billy...

16:40.833 --> 16:43.752
Were you really
just wrong place, wrong time?

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
Yeah.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.467
I guess that's shitty luck
for both of us, huh?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.219
So, why?

16:53.971 --> 16:54.972
Eh...

16:55.681 --> 16:57.891
I've been asking myself the same thing.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.397
There's no stopping it now.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.816
It's gonna have to play out.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.278
One way or the other.

17:10.571 --> 17:14.700
Sheriff! Sheriff, these guys
are here about an extradition.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.035
Nobody told me.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.703
Sorry to bother you, Sheriff.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.873
The paperwork's en route. Fax is
probably coming through as we speak.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.375
Bottom line, I'm here to take
two prisoners off your hands.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.003
We're talking about a white male,
white female?

17:26.086 --> 17:27.713
-Correct.
-Yeah.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.214
What's their story, anyway?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.800
-'Cause they ain't talking.
-Yeah, I bet they aren't.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.429
We've got 'em on a multiple homicide.
Drug deal gone wrong.

17:35.512 --> 17:40.517
The guy's got heavy connections,
and word is he uses the kid as a mule.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.479
Hang on.
You're talking about a female juvenile?

17:43.562 --> 17:44.396
That's right.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.150
-She's still in your custody, I hope?
-Yeah...

17:48.692 --> 17:51.361
Thing is,
we barely had time to process the girl.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.989
Let us save you the trouble.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.991
Not till they've been arraigned.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.743
When's that

17:58.285 --> 17:59.411
This Thursday.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.122
Thursday

18:02.206 --> 18:04.666
The kind that does arraignments
on Thursday.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.171
I suggest you take that time
to get your paperwork.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.132
Come back Thursday,
maybe the judge will figure something out.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.302
Yeah, that's not gonna work for us.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.847
Well, at least you can let us see 'em,
ask a few questions,

18:18.931 --> 18:21.100
see what they got in their property.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.184
Potential evidence.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.021
What's that sign over at the diner,
behind the register?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.273
"Management reserves the right
to refuse service."

18:28.357 --> 18:30.359
That's it. We need to get one.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.693
Okay.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.074
Lieutenant, you don't look so good.

18:37.157 --> 18:41.328
-He don't look good, does he, Dobbs?
-No, sir, he, uh... he don't.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.705
You better get home, see your doctor.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.500
Did you take an oath, Sheriff?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.962
-Excuse me?
-An oath.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.258
Did you take an oath
when you came into office?

18:54.800 --> 18:55.634
I did.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.012
Before God. I'm not about to break it.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.099
I respect that.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.394
I, too, made a promise before God.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.941
No need for anyone to get hurt
if they don't have to.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.407
I'm sorry, I don't think I got your name.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.169
Hosea 8, verse 7...

19:31.461 --> 19:35.799
"He that sows the wind
shall reap the whirlwind."

19:56.695 --> 19:57.613
Go.

20:10.834 --> 20:11.960
What the hell?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.006
You guys need to do something right now.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.883
Murphy, get the staties on the phone.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.428
Phone's out, Sheriff.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.096
No. Seriously?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.097
I'mma kill Sprint.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.182
Radio?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.686
What's going on?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.149
Waiting's over.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.194
Guess so.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.491
Dobbs, get back to your desk.
Keep trying the radio.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.326
Think it's them

20:44.409 --> 20:47.329
-What are we talking about?
-We turned away a couple asshole city cops

20:47.412 --> 20:49.248
who didn't have
their extradition paperwork.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.962
You're running out of time
to tell us what the hell's going on.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.797
Please just let me go before they come.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.467
-You need to start talking.
-Who's coming

21:01.176 --> 21:02.344
We don't know what this is.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.595
But you're holding a rifle?

21:20.404 --> 21:21.405
ID?

21:42.175 --> 21:44.303
Dr. Dumont, I... I'm so sorry.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.014
Are you okay Do you need anything?

21:47.097 --> 21:48.098
I'm not hurt.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.267
Then why have they got you
sitting here like this?

21:50.350 --> 21:53.979
I haven't made my statement.
I'm waiting for a detective or something.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.230
Unless that's you?

21:56.148 --> 22:00.360
-No. This... this isn't my case.
-But you're here anyway.

22:01.278 --> 22:06.366
You know, all the months I've been
coming here, pushing for the truth...

22:07.284 --> 22:11.038
waiting for Billy to slip up,
waiting for him to show what he really is,

22:11.121 --> 22:12.831
I hope now you understand.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.876
You think Billy was planning this?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.753
You don't?

22:19.254 --> 22:21.798
There was an activation
of Billy's fear network

22:21.882 --> 22:25.677
in response to emotional
and cognitive triggers.

22:26.261 --> 22:31.350
Responses to that kind of activation
include escape, avoidance.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.269
It's primal. It's involuntary.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.856
You don't know him like I do.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.442
I've been treating him for months.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.694
Everything I saw

22:42.778 --> 22:45.364
was a confused and frightened individual
acting on impulse.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.408
You think I'm so bad at what I do
that I can't tell the difference?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.582
Is there anything he said under your care,

22:55.665 --> 23:00.003
any... clue at all
that might indicate his whereabouts?

23:00.087 --> 23:04.758
So I can, uh... bring him in... safely.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.177
Last time you brought him in,
you almost killed him,

23:07.260 --> 23:08.845
destroyed his face.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.764
I don't recall you being there.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.601
Are you trying to ban me from this place?

23:14.684 --> 23:16.812
I banned you, Agent Madani.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.897
I got sick of asking nicely.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.983
Because your visits could impact
any case we bring against Mr. Russo.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.443
I am just doing my job.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.529
You don't have a job here,
Agent Madani.

23:25.612 --> 23:29.157
The jurisdictions are clear.
Russo is NYPD territory.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.867
Your agency agreed to that.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.702
Right around when they
handed us the paperwork

23:32.786 --> 23:34.621
on a crime scene they trampled all over,

23:34.704 --> 23:36.873
like they were doing us a favor,
throwing us a bone.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.667
But here's why I think they did that.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.920
Because of your personal connection
to Mr. Russo.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.259
Do I need to get you escorted
off my crime scene, Agent Madani?

23:47.843 --> 23:50.095
I'd prefer to spare us both
the embarrassment.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.516
I'm sorry. Forgive us.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.394
I'm Sergeant Mahoney.
I'm here to take your statement.

23:57.477 --> 24:01.356
The good doctor thinks Russo
is a lost soul cast adrift in the world.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.067
Maybe you two deserve each other.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.864
Please have a seat.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.370
Respiratory care tech
needed in 302.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.832
Respiratory care tech needed in 302.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.271
Castiglione, let's go!

24:41.354 --> 24:44.357
Handing us over so soon? I thought
you'd show a little more sack than that.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.152
You're not going anywhere.
I need you to start talking.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.362
Face the wall. Hands over your head.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.492
Sheriff, if he's going home,
can I have his sandwich?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.622
You're crazy. You want your arm stuck?

24:58.705 --> 25:00.832
-Shh.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.335
They're gonna have to amputate
to get you outta there.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.715
-Ye of little faith.
-Impressive.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.801
Stealing from a vending machine
inside of a police station.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.387
Well, give me back my five, then.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.306
Mmm. You know, it's... it's gone.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.017
I put it in the machine
just before the power went out.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.393
Sorry.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.196
What do you think is going on right now?

25:31.279 --> 25:33.573
-I think the phones aren't ringing.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.785
That feedback from the radio
tells me there's a jammer out there.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.163
I think you're sitting
alone in the dark, Sheriff.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.415
You got wolves all around you.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.793
And I think you know it.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.088
The question is,
what are you going to do about it?

25:48.672 --> 25:50.549
It might help if I knew
what I was dealing with.

25:52.968 --> 25:53.969
Okay.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.721
Two days ago, I was...

25:56.805 --> 25:59.766
I was at a bar outside Detroit.
I was having a beer.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.851
That woman and her team, they showed up.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.020
They went after the kid hard.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.356
I stepped in.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.235
All in all, 13 bad guys,
they got put down.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.614
See, in the process,
they shot a friend of mine,

26:14.698 --> 26:16.116
and that pissed me off.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.285
I figured the kid
had something they wanted

26:18.368 --> 26:20.662
and that they'd try again,
so I took her. I split.

26:20.745 --> 26:24.207
They tracked me to that motel,
and you got the full meat wagon.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.377
Thirteen

26:27.460 --> 26:28.878
I guess not so much.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.637
Why?

26:38.930 --> 26:41.933
-I'm not really the citizen's arrest type.
-Why get involved?

26:42.017 --> 26:44.936
A man's got a right to defend himself
and defend those who can't.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.939
You laid up for them in that motel.
You could've run. You didn't.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.108
If you run, you can't see
what's coming up behind you.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.943
-That's premeditation.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.946
What do they want from you?

26:57.866 --> 26:59.409
Why did you tie her up?

27:00.160 --> 27:03.580
She's ungrateful.
Kids today, they got no manners.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.917
You wanted her for bait.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.423
Sheriff, when these people come,
they come in numbers and they come hard.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.342
I've seen it twice already.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.052
You need to give 'em what they want.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.928
You and the girl?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.014
Hand you over just like that?

27:21.097 --> 27:22.766
And the woman. They'll want her, too.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.935
Sheriff, I think
we should consider what he's saying.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.396
All we need
is for one of us to go get help.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.358
If I take the Charger,
I'll be back with the cavalry

27:31.441 --> 27:33.568
before these jokers
even realize it's happening.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.611
Don't do it, Sheriff.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.323
-You're not in charge here.
-Neither are you.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.619
Dobbs...

27:43.495 --> 27:44.871
is the Charger gassed up?

27:44.954 --> 27:47.499
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh, filled it this morning.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.918
-Good. Give Ogden the keys.
-Ogden?

27:50.001 --> 27:53.129
-That's too much car for Ogden, Sheriff.
-Just give him the keys.

27:54.047 --> 27:58.051
Ogden, all you need to do is get clear
of whatever's jamming the radio.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.886
Call the staties, okay?

28:00.553 --> 28:02.222
You're making a mistake, Sheriff.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.642
You can count on me.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.726
Let's go.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.022
-Shit.
-What the hell?

28:53.106 --> 28:54.399
It's too much car.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.737
Ogden! You okay?

28:59.988 --> 29:00.905
I'm hit!

29:02.031 --> 29:03.032
Cover us.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.837
Let's get out of here.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.130
Okay, come on. Okay.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.966
Stay low, okay? You're okay.
Come on. Stay low.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.553
Stay low. Stay low. Stay low.Â Stay low.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.645
Murphy?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.898
I see him. Say the word.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.108
-Hold your fire. Get him inside.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.443
Shut the door!

29:53.958 --> 29:55.126
Gut shot.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.171
I give him two to three hours.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.300
He'll survive,
but only if he gets to a hospital.

30:02.383 --> 30:05.094
He's got a wife and a child.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.846
He's protecting godless people,

30:07.806 --> 30:09.516
undeserving of your honor.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.853
Do the right thing. Give us what
we came for, and we'll leave quietly.

30:13.937 --> 30:14.979
You have my word.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.690
From one God-fearing man to another.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.953
-Get inside. Go. Go.

30:30.036 --> 30:33.248
Stay low!
All of you, keep away from the windows.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.626
What the hell is going on,
Sheriff?

30:39.212 --> 30:40.421
Oh, God.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.970
-Dobbs, get some vests.
-What can I do to help?

30:47.053 --> 30:49.180
-What can I do to help?
-Hold this hard!

30:49.264 --> 30:51.641
Okay, just...
just hang in there, okay?

30:52.725 --> 30:54.435
That's great. No triple XLs.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.188
-Murphy, get a vest on.
-This is crazy, sir.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.566
All respect, but what are we doing

30:59.649 --> 31:00.650
We're not equipped.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.570
Dobbs, give them vests, too. Them, too!

31:04.237 --> 31:06.698
If Ogden dies because of you assholes,
you'll need one of those.

31:06.781 --> 31:09.033
No offense, ma'am,
you're not really my problem right now.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.327
Dobbs, take over for Murphy.
Murphy, you're with me.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.501
Sheriff, if Ogden bleeds out,
that's on us.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.004
-I'm not gonna let that happen.
-What if we just send one out?

31:21.087 --> 31:22.755
The guy. Hell, he wants to go.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.383
Think about who we're protecting here.
Murderers?

31:25.466 --> 31:27.093
Are we gonna look after
a couple strangers,

31:27.176 --> 31:29.220
-or are we gonna look after our own?

31:33.808 --> 31:35.184
I'm gonna go get him some water.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.408
Sheriff...

31:51.659 --> 31:53.036
just set me loose.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.080
Set me loose, Sheriff.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.420
You're gonna make a citizen's arrest

32:03.379 --> 32:05.506
You're gonna save the day one-handed?

32:07.592 --> 32:09.302
You got a pretty high opinion of yourself.

32:09.385 --> 32:12.388
You set the rules, I'll follow 'em.
I give you my word.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.893
You might be military,
but these people of yours,

32:16.976 --> 32:18.311
they're amateurs, and you know it.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.606
-You need all the help you can get.
-Help?

32:21.689 --> 32:23.983
You're the cause of all this,
you murdering bastard.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.736
You ever put a round in someone?

32:27.278 --> 32:29.489
You ever fire your weapon
in the field, even?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.617
That's what I thought.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.412
You better tell 'em to let you out now.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.539
My people could take
this whole building down.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.291
Old Testament shit.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.294
You've seen the Internet.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.214
They could bust in here
using flamethrowers on men in cages.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.298
Me?

32:48.132 --> 32:50.134
Sweet boneless Jesus.
I shouldn't even be in here.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.971
My own goddamn brother locked me up
for being drunk in public.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.265
Yo, Ken, get your ass in here
and talk to me!

32:56.349 --> 32:57.433
Ken!

33:19.914 --> 33:20.915
Jesus!

33:20.999 --> 33:22.166
Return fire!

33:23.876 --> 33:25.712
Who the hell
are these guys, Sheriff?

33:34.095 --> 33:36.139
There's an army of them
out there!

33:43.146 --> 33:45.023
God damn it! Dobbs!

33:45.606 --> 33:48.067
-Return fire! Two o'clock!
-I'll cover the right.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.113
Sheriff! God damn it! It's a diversion!

33:52.196 --> 33:54.157
You need to cover the back.
Cover the back door!

33:54.240 --> 33:56.242
That back door is industrialized steel!

34:20.725 --> 34:22.018
Damn it, Ogden!

34:29.942 --> 34:31.277
Come on!

34:31.903 --> 34:34.322
-Come on!
-Step back! Shit!

34:36.282 --> 34:37.450
Dobbs!

34:43.664 --> 34:44.957
Shit, shit, shit!

34:45.500 --> 34:47.543
-Cover your eyes!
-Move it! Let's go!

34:47.627 --> 34:49.170
You've gotta be kidding me!

34:53.049 --> 34:53.883
Holy...

35:12.652 --> 35:14.570
It's okay. It's okay. Easy.

35:21.536 --> 35:22.620
What are you doing?

35:24.705 --> 35:25.706
He's loose!

35:29.544 --> 35:30.711
Give me that.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.508
-Got it. Go! Go! Go!
-Move! Move! Move!

35:36.092 --> 35:37.760
-Come on!
-Go!

35:42.723 --> 35:43.724
Take cover!

36:18.676 --> 36:20.344
You know I can't let you run.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.808
Your weapon's empty, Sheriff.

36:33.691 --> 36:37.236
Sheriff, if you need someone to run,
I'm your man.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.789
-Drop your weapon!
-Murphy. Put that gun down.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.166
We're trusting him?

36:50.249 --> 36:52.835
He had a chance to rabbit, and he didn't.
We're trusting him.

37:02.094 --> 37:03.679
Little Junior, what happened?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.932
Take a wild guess, Bruce.

37:06.015 --> 37:10.269
You look like you got shot! Shit!
I told you this wasn't the job for you.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.313
Sheriff, they got explosives.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.899
They can tear this whole place down.
She told me as much.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.526
How many you think are out there?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.904
-Too many.
-We don't owe these people anything.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.659
Dobbs, what about you?

37:25.868 --> 37:27.578
Think we should turn these prisoners over?

37:29.622 --> 37:30.998
Ogden needs a doctor.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.459
No, you can't do that.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.171
I'd never be able to live with myself
if I knew these people died because of me.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.883
How the hell can any of you
live with yourselves?

37:41.425 --> 37:45.513
I took the same oath as all of you...

37:45.596 --> 37:47.974
...and I intend to keep it.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.442
Well, give me a scattergun, 'cause
I'm seeing triple and can't aim for shit.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.402
Come on.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.241
You doing okay?

38:06.325 --> 38:08.035
We can't just sit here.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.207
They're gonna kill us.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.336
You can kill every last one. I don't care.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.715
But let me be the one
to put a bullet in Castiglione.

38:23.009 --> 38:26.345
Give me a team to hit from this side,
while another team works the back.

38:26.887 --> 38:29.390
There's only four of them left,
plus the kid.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.436
I'll finish the job,
be out of the country by dawn.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.980
I got passports, plenty of places to go.

38:47.825 --> 38:48.951
Show me again.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.129
Back door,
this corridor leads to the bull--

39:10.556 --> 39:12.391
"Our God is a consuming fire."

39:12.475 --> 39:16.103
"For the children of this life
shall be cast into darkness."

39:16.645 --> 39:20.149
"Dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return."

39:20.816 --> 39:22.735
"For this world is not your home."

39:39.377 --> 39:42.630
You need to lay down,
put pressure on that wound.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.053
Hey, you keep standing up like that,
you're gonna bleed out.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.186
You want to die tonight, kid

39:58.145 --> 39:59.313
Is that what you want?

40:03.776 --> 40:04.902
No, sir.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.115
Hey...

40:14.203 --> 40:15.413
You did good.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.375
What you did was as brave
as anyone I ever saw.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.295
But now it's time...

40:24.797 --> 40:26.132
you sit there.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.300
You sit back.

40:35.641 --> 40:36.642
Go on.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.607
That's it.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.324
Now it's your turn to stand up, Bruce.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.162
Anybody who wants to kill you
is gonna have to come through me.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.540
Hey, Sheriff, can I get
a badge or something?

40:59.623 --> 41:02.460
I think one of those vests
might be more like it.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.925
He doesn't have much longer.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.260
I'm all ears.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.305
You know, whoever's out there...

41:15.639 --> 41:17.016
they've gone too far.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.270
Next step, they come in here,
they burn us all out.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.731
And they don't stop till we're dead.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.195
Let me go.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.656
You're in no shape for that.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.953
You got any black tape?

42:57.825 --> 43:00.327
Help! Help! Help me!

43:43.787 --> 43:46.290
Yeah, assholes, how do you like that?

43:47.666 --> 43:51.003
You ever, like, see that Western
where the guy comes to town...

43:51.754 --> 43:54.715
turns out he's, like, the devil
or death or something?

43:55.257 --> 43:57.009
Hell, who gives a shit?

43:58.385 --> 44:00.387
Long as he's on our side.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.680
Homeland Security! Drop your weapons!

45:24.763 --> 45:27.349
Do not move! Stay where you are!

45:57.671 --> 45:59.423
That's quite an entrance, Madani.

46:01.508 --> 46:06.013
-You look like shit, Castle.
-Yeah, it's been a rough couple days.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.641
You changed your mind, huh?

46:12.227 --> 46:13.979
Someone changed it for me.

46:20.986 --> 46:23.155
Billy Russo broke out of the hospital.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.166
You're gonna be okay. Hold on.

46:34.249 --> 46:35.417
Man, I'm hungry.

46:36.710 --> 46:37.795
Are you hungry?

46:39.588 --> 46:40.589
Is that weird?

46:42.132 --> 46:47.012
Hey, um... Listen, I just...
I wanted to say thank you.

46:47.721 --> 46:51.058
I mean, I know you were just doing
your job and everything, but...

46:51.767 --> 46:53.644
I gotta say, it was really amazing,

46:53.727 --> 46:57.815
putting your life before a bunch of people
you barely know. So...

46:59.525 --> 47:00.567
thank you.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.324
So, your name really Rachel?

47:10.744 --> 47:11.829
Good luck, Ogden.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.254
Sheriff, Mr. Castiglione here

47:20.337 --> 47:22.965
is part of a very sensitive
Homeland Security investigation.

47:23.632 --> 47:24.633
Is that right?

47:25.217 --> 47:27.052
I would like it if he was never here.

47:27.719 --> 47:28.762
Officially.

47:41.608 --> 47:44.111
Marine, you saved my ass
more than once tonight...

47:45.195 --> 47:47.239
and the lives
of everyone in that building.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.199
That's a fact.

47:51.034 --> 47:55.330
So there's a scenario
where she doesn't take you

47:55.873 --> 47:58.208
-and you still weren't here.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.003
Yeah, I appreciate it.

48:01.545 --> 48:04.882
My van's trashed. I could use a ride.

48:06.717 --> 48:11.638
Well, as far as we're concerned,
Pete Castiglione was never here.

48:12.931 --> 48:13.932
Yeah.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.270
Sheriff, look, there's...
there's one more thing.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.690
I gotta take the girl.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.653
-Unfinished business?
-That's right.

48:38.540 --> 48:39.541
Frank...

48:40.083 --> 48:41.627
She comes, or I don't.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.129
Marine!

48:48.634 --> 48:52.054
I kept the guns. I don't want any more
bodies on my conscience. No offense.

48:52.137 --> 48:54.723
-None taken.
-Think you might want these, too?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.436
Thank you, Sheriff.

48:59.519 --> 49:00.979
I don't want to know.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.230
Where are we going?

49:02.314 --> 49:04.566
New York.
