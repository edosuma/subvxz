00:08.384 --> 00:10.843
      This week on "VICE,"
      the inside story

00:10.886 --> 00:13.178
      of America's
      surveillance program.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.140
      I'm gonna be
      detaching the camera.

00:16.183 --> 00:16.890
  The devices that you paid for

00:16.934 --> 00:20.436
    watch you on our behalf.

00:22.815 --> 00:25.190
               It seems like
               technology allows

00:25.234 --> 00:28.360
   almost anyone to spy
   on almost anyone.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.863
           Snowden:
      <i> Even if you trust</i>
    <i> the government today,</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:33.073
        <i> what happens</i>
        <i> when it changes?</i>

00:33.117 --> 00:34.199
         When eventually we get
         an individual who says,

00:34.243 --> 00:37.244
        "You know what?
        Let's flip that switch"?

¶ ¶

01:03.606 --> 01:04.938
            Smith:
        <i> First of all,</i>
       <i> I'd like to say</i>

01:04.982 --> 01:06.565
      <i> thank you</i>
      <i> for meeting us today</i>

01:06.609 --> 01:09.193
  <i> here at the storied</i>
  <i> Hotel Metropol in Moscow.</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:10.694
  I say "storied"
  because for the longest time,

01:10.738 --> 01:13.530
 <i> it was the designated hotel</i>
 <i> where foreigners were</i>

01:13.574 --> 01:16.074
       <i> allowed to stay,</i>
       <i> and it was rumored</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:18.952
that every room was bugged.
 (laughs)

01:18.996 --> 01:20.412
      I would definitely presume

01:20.456 --> 01:22.956
      that in any world capital,

01:23.000 --> 01:24.750
   or in major business hotel,
     Mm.

01:24.794 --> 01:28.337
          if the h-- hotel rooms
          aren't pre-wired
          for surveillance,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.130
            <i> they can be wired</i>
            <i> almost immediately.</i>

01:30.174 --> 01:31.840
               ¶ ¶

01:38.974 --> 01:40.390
    For the last three years,

01:40.434 --> 01:42.851
    a controversy has raged
    about the US government's

01:42.895 --> 01:44.770
       surveillance
       of its own people.

01:44.814 --> 01:45.979
       A terrorist attack
       last December

01:46.023 --> 01:48.232
 in San Bernardino, California,

01:48.275 --> 01:50.567
       brought this debate
       to a tipping point.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.610
Reporter:
<i>14 people are dead</i>

01:51.654 --> 01:53.195
<i>and 21 people</i>
<i>have been injured</i>

01:53.239 --> 01:56.657
<i>after a married couple</i>
<i>opened fire</i>

01:56.700 --> 01:58.325
<i>at the Inland</i>
<i>Regional Center</i>

01:58.369 --> 01:59.993
<i>in San Bernardino.</i>

02:00.037 --> 02:01.787
          Reporter 2:
  <i> A judge is ordering Apple</i>
       <i> to help the FBI</i>

02:01.831 --> 02:03.121
   <i> break into a cell phone</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:05.415
  <i> used by one of</i>
  <i> the San Bernardino shooters.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:06.875
Apple is saying, "Look,

02:06.919 --> 02:09.919
<i>this is something that</i>
<i>no court can order us to do."</i>

02:09.964 --> 02:11.672
Tim Cook:
<i>What is at stake here is</i>

02:11.715 --> 02:14.341
can the government
compel Apple

02:14.385 --> 02:15.592
to write software

02:15.636 --> 02:18.554
that we believe would make
hundreds of millions

02:18.597 --> 02:20.013
of customers vulnerable
around the world?

02:20.057 --> 02:22.850
       If it is possible to make

02:22.893 --> 02:26.353
         an impenetrable device,

02:26.397 --> 02:28.605
                <i> how do we solve</i>

02:28.649 --> 02:30.148
  or disrupt a terrorist plot?

02:30.192 --> 02:31.441
     Smith: <i> But according to</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:32.818
<i>the most famous whistleblower</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

02:32.862 --> 02:35.404
   <i> the government already had</i>
   <i> this capability...</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:46.832
    <i> and as it turned out,</i>

02:46.876 --> 02:48.792
    <i> Snowden was proved right</i>

02:48.836 --> 02:50.961
   <i> 'cause the FBI was able</i>
   <i> to crack the iPhone</i>

02:51.005 --> 02:52.713
    <i> without Apple's help.</i>

02:52.756 --> 02:53.922
 <i> Now, Edward Snowden remains</i>

02:53.966 --> 02:56.800
    <i> a polarizing figure</i>
    <i> in American politics</i>

02:56.844 --> 02:59.344
   <i> because on one side,</i>
   <i> he's considered a hero</i>

02:59.388 --> 03:00.971
<i>on the level of Woodward</i>
<i>and Bernstein, who broke</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:03.181
<i>the Watergate scandal,</i>

03:03.225 --> 03:04.641
<i>but on the other,</i>
<i>he's considered</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:07.477
  <i> a traitor who jeopardized</i>
  <i> American intelligence</i>

03:07.521 --> 03:09.646
      <i> and security</i>
      <i> around the world.</i>

03:09.690 --> 03:10.689
           A traitor!

03:10.733 --> 03:13.108
 A traitor
 to the United States!

03:13.152 --> 03:17.738
      These records were
      spread about publicly

03:17.781 --> 03:20.449
        by Edward Snowden

03:20.492 --> 03:24.202
        internationally,
        recklessly,

03:24.246 --> 03:26.163
  and, I might say, illegally.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.999
            Smith:
    <i> So, we went to Moscow</i>

03:29.043 --> 03:30.918
    <i> to speak to</i>
    <i> this controversial figure</i>

03:30.961 --> 03:32.502
       <i> about the state</i>
       <i> of surveillance</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.463
      <i> in America today.</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:40.636
So NSA, CIA, FBI,
can they get into my phone?

03:40.679 --> 03:41.845
                   Yes.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.847
Can they get into my laptop?
           Absolutely.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.223
     iPad, any--
            Anything.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.810
    As long as they can dedicate
    people, money, and time

03:48.854 --> 03:50.145
             to the target,
             they can get in.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.647
  And what kind
 of information

03:51.690 --> 03:53.357
can they get
from my phone, for example?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.692
          Uh, everything
          in your contacts list,

03:55.736 --> 03:56.902
          every, uh, SMS message
          that you use,

03:56.946 --> 03:59.154
    every place that's ever been

03:59.198 --> 04:01.198
          where the phone
          is physically located,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.324
              even if you've got

04:02.368 --> 04:04.076
            GPS disabled
            because they can see

04:04.119 --> 04:06.328
    which wireless access points
    are near you.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.956
         Every part
         of a private life today

04:08.999 --> 04:10.415
    is found on someone's phone.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.085
     We used to say a man's home
     is his castle.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.462
            Today, a man's phone
            is his castle.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.589
My question to you is,
why don't more people care?

04:18.634 --> 04:22.386
Because we've gone
from Cold War, pre-9/11,

04:22.429 --> 04:24.054
        to effectively
        a police state

04:24.098 --> 04:25.263
         that's watching
        your every move,

04:25.307 --> 04:26.848
    and everyone went, "Eh."

04:26.892 --> 04:30.310
     Why?
     Part of it is the fact
     that it happened invisibly.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.436
             Mm-hmm.
                 Uh...

04:31.480 --> 04:32.771
    if a politician had said,

04:32.815 --> 04:34.690
   "We want to watch
   everybody in the country,"

04:34.733 --> 04:35.565
    uh, people would've been
    up in arms about it.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.734
               ¶ ¶

04:37.778 --> 04:39.444
            Snowden:
          <i> In the wake</i>
       <i> of September 11th,</i>

04:39.488 --> 04:41.655
      <i> the Vice President</i>
      <i> of the United States,</i>
      <i> Dick Cheney,</i>

04:41.699 --> 04:43.031
    <i> and his personal lawyer,</i>
    <i> David Addington,</i>

04:43.075 --> 04:46.159
   <i> conspired with a number</i>
    <i> of top level officials</i>

04:46.203 --> 04:48.453
  <i> in the NSA</i>
  <i> and other agencies to change</i>

04:48.497 --> 04:51.581
    <i> not only what</i>
    <i> they considered to be</i>

04:51.625 --> 04:53.417
    <i> the legal restraints,</i>

04:53.460 --> 04:56.378
    <i> but actually the culture</i>
    <i> of surveillance</i>

04:56.422 --> 04:57.671
<i>in the Intelligence Community.</i>

04:57.715 --> 05:01.299
  They moved from
  the exceptional surveillance

05:01.343 --> 05:04.344
         to the surveillance
         of everyone.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.597
        <i> Technology has changed.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:10.058
      <i> Instead of sending people</i>
      <i> to follow you,</i>

05:10.102 --> 05:12.060
       we use the devices
       that you paid for.
Mm.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.437
                <i> The services</i>
                <i> and the systems</i>

05:13.480 --> 05:15.230
            <i> that surround you</i>
            <i> invisibly every day</i>

05:15.274 --> 05:19.568
               <i> to watch you</i>
               <i> on our behalf.</i>

05:19.611 --> 05:23.447
 Meta data is the fact
 that a communication occurred.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.032
So, I called you--
         You called me,

05:25.075 --> 05:27.284
     <i> when you called me,</i>

05:27.327 --> 05:29.202
  <i> where you called me from,</i>

05:29.246 --> 05:31.830
<i>this information is</i>
<i>the same thing that's produced</i>

05:31.874 --> 05:35.792
 <i> when a private investigator</i>
 <i> follows you around all day.</i>

05:35.836 --> 05:37.544
     <i> They can't sit</i>
     <i> close enough to you</i>

05:37.588 --> 05:39.504
  <i> in every café to hear</i>
  <i> every word you're saying,</i>

05:39.548 --> 05:42.340
      but they can be
      close enough to know

05:42.384 --> 05:44.551
    when you left your house,
    what the license plate

05:44.595 --> 05:46.011
     of the car
     you were driving with,

05:46.055 --> 05:47.971
        where you went,
        who you sat with,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.681
    how long you were there,
    when you left,

05:49.725 --> 05:50.307
   where you went after that.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.392
        That's meta data.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.686
            Smith:
 <i> Now, all of this meta data,</i>
        <i> it turns out,</i>

05:54.730 --> 05:57.647
    <i> was actually remarkably</i>
    <i> east to get at. In fact,</i>

05:57.691 --> 05:59.775
     <i> you don't even have to</i>
     <i> hack the phone at all.</i>

05:59.818 --> 06:02.235
   <i> All you need is technology</i>
   <i> that is readily available,</i>

06:02.279 --> 06:03.987
   <i> called an IMSI catcher,</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:05.113
       <i> that can intercept</i>

06:05.157 --> 06:07.449
     <i> your phone's</i>
     <i> meta data remotely.</i>

06:07.493 --> 06:09.117
                 Every phone has

06:09.161 --> 06:10.952
          what's called am IMSI,
         Mm-hmm.

06:10.996 --> 06:14.289
           uh, which is actually
           for the SIM card.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.083
     That's your
     subscriber information.
    Mm-hmm.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.376
      What your name is,
      what your phone number is.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.669
             <i> All of our devices</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:21.588
             <i> as they travel</i>
             <i> throughout the day</i>

06:21.632 --> 06:24.508
    <i> are constantly broadcasting</i>
    <i> in sort of this</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:26.176
           radio orchestra.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.636
        IMSI catchers masquerade

06:27.679 --> 06:30.097
               as the legitimate
               cell phone tower.
             Mm-hmm.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.349
         So, when you're saying,
         "Hey, cell phone tower,

06:32.392 --> 06:33.975
              <i> can you hear me?"</i>

06:34.019 --> 06:36.186
                 <i> Instead, a man</i>
                 <i> in the middle,</i>

06:36.230 --> 06:37.479
  <i> somebody with an IMSI catcher</i>
  <i> in the trunk of their car,</i>

06:37.523 --> 06:40.649
                <i> in a briefcase,</i>
                <i> in their office</i>

06:40.692 --> 06:44.194
     has it send a louder signal
     back to you
    Uh-huh.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.529
       than the cell phone tower

06:45.572 --> 06:47.823
     and say,
     "I'm the cell phone tower."

06:47.866 --> 06:50.033
 Now, this sounds
  pretty complex.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.702
How hard is it to-- to make
or buy an IMSI catcher?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.995
           It's incredibly easy.
           You buy these things
           off the shelf.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.581
         Every police department
         in the United States

06:56.625 --> 06:57.582
              seems to be buying

06:57.626 --> 06:58.959
          these things nowadays.
   Really?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.710
             Smith:
          <i> Now, the use</i>
        <i> of IMSI catchers</i>

07:00.754 --> 07:02.671
  <i> by police recently caused</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:04.923
   <i> international headlines</i>
   <i> when a newspaper in Norway</i>

07:04.967 --> 07:07.801
<i>attempted to track the amount</i>
<i>of IMSI catchers in Oslo,</i>

07:07.845 --> 07:11.555
   <i> and actually found so many</i>
   <i> that they questioned</i>

07:11.598 --> 07:14.224
      <i> if their tracker was</i>
      <i> working properly.</i>

07:14.268 --> 07:16.351
     <i> After hiring</i>
     <i> a cyber security firm,</i>

07:16.395 --> 07:17.769
<i>they discovered that not only</i>
<i>were they indeed correct,</i>

07:17.813 --> 07:21.606
     <i> but these devices were</i>
     <i> actually being used</i>

07:21.650 --> 07:24.943
     <i> to spy on their own</i>
     <i> government facilities.</i>

07:24.987 --> 07:27.112
     In five places in Oslo,
     uh, the measurements

07:27.156 --> 07:29.364
         were so serious
        that I could say

07:29.408 --> 07:32.450
  with a high probability
  that there was IMSI catchers.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.910
              Foss:
      <i> The most clear signs</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:36.663
<i>was in the areas</i>
<i>of the Prime Minister's office</i>

07:36.707 --> 07:38.540
     <i> and of the Ministry</i>
     <i> of Defence.</i>

07:38.584 --> 07:39.666
       <i> We also got alerts</i>

07:39.710 --> 07:41.376
    <i> up in the Embassy's area</i>
    <i> and in the--</i>

07:41.420 --> 07:43.670
 <i> in front of the Parliament.</i>

07:43.714 --> 07:45.672
             Smith:
      <i> And while the police</i>
     <i> initially denied using</i>

07:45.716 --> 07:47.507
   <i> IMSI catchers extensively,</i>

07:47.551 --> 07:49.384
  <i> in the face</i>
  <i> of overwhelming evidence,</i>

07:49.428 --> 07:51.595
<i>they were eventually forced</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

07:51.638 --> 07:54.306
             Foss:
      <i> The police stated</i>
      <i> that we are using</i>

07:54.349 --> 07:56.933
    IMSI catcher, at minimum,
    once a week,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.977
       and that was
       the first time ever

07:59.021 --> 08:01.688
  that the police had gone out
  and stated how often

08:01.732 --> 08:04.065
    they were using
    these kinds of equipment.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.775
  <i> In all the areas</i>
  <i> that we detected signals,</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:07.903
   <i> thousands of people are</i>
   <i> strolling by every day.</i>

08:07.946 --> 08:10.822
  So, that's-- I think that's,
  uh, some of the problem

08:10.866 --> 08:12.657
 with these kinds of technology
 because you're looking

08:12.701 --> 08:15.869
  for one number,
  but you're in the same place.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.537
      You're collecting
      hundreds of numbers.

08:17.581 --> 08:18.538
             Smith:
      <i> Now, this technology</i>

08:18.582 --> 08:21.041
        <i> is being used</i>
        <i> by police forces</i>

08:21.084 --> 08:22.167
     <i> all over the world.</i>

08:22.211 --> 08:24.044
   <i> In fact,</i>
   <i> in New York City alone,</i>

08:24.087 --> 08:25.879
  <i> IMSI catchers have been used</i>
  <i> more than a thousand times</i>

08:25.923 --> 08:30.300
     <i> by police since 2008,</i>
     <i> and that's just the tip</i>

08:30.344 --> 08:32.427
  <i> of the iceberg,</i>
  <i> as they're now being used</i>

08:32.471 --> 08:35.138
        <i> all around us</i>
        <i> all the time.</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.265
                 There's a joint
                 CIA/NSA program

08:37.308 --> 08:39.308
   called, appropriately enough,
   Shenanigans.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.354
       Shenanigans was a project

08:42.397 --> 08:45.440
           to mount on airplanes
           an IMSI catcher

08:45.484 --> 08:47.734
    <i> and fly it around the city.</i>

08:47.778 --> 08:48.568
          <i> They can tell</i>
          <i> when you've traveled,</i>

08:48.612 --> 08:49.653
    they can tell when you move,

08:49.696 --> 08:52.113
            and this all happens
            without warrants.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.365
      Right.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.699
            Shenanigans was
            happening in Yemen.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.409
   Right.
      Uh, that's where
      it was being tested.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.911
    And you go, "Well, look,
    this is being used

08:57.955 --> 08:59.496
               <i> "to aim missiles</i>
               <i> at terrorists.</i>

08:59.539 --> 09:00.872
           <i> I'm okay with that."</i>

09:00.916 --> 09:05.043
         but these programs have
         a disturbing frequency,

09:05.087 --> 09:08.463
   a tendency, to move
   from war front to home front.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.508
   Right.
      And within six months

09:11.551 --> 09:12.884
  of Shenanigans being reported,

09:12.928 --> 09:15.553
       "The Wall Street Journal"
       reported that the same

09:15.597 --> 09:16.763
           technology was now
           being used

09:16.807 --> 09:19.683
            <i> domestically inside</i>
             <i> the United States.</i>

09:19.726 --> 09:23.186
         <i> The FBI has a specific</i>
         <i> aviation unit</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

09:23.230 --> 09:24.771
             <i> that's flying</i>
             <i> around cities, uh,</i>

09:24.815 --> 09:27.983
   and frequently, they're--
   they're monitoring protesters

09:28.026 --> 09:29.401
  rather than violent criminals.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.696
    <i> With the Black Lives Matter</i>
    <i> protests in Baltimore,</i>

09:32.739 --> 09:35.198
             the FBI was
             flying surveillance

09:35.242 --> 09:36.658
            over the protesters.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.410
             Smith:
       <i> Now, this has been</i>
        <i> cause for alarm</i>

09:38.453 --> 09:40.578
  <i> because modern</i>
  <i> surveillance technologies</i>

09:40.622 --> 09:43.206
     <i> are already being used</i>
     <i> by oppressive regimes</i>

09:43.250 --> 09:45.542
     <i> to suppress</i>
     <i> government opposition.</i>

09:45.585 --> 09:47.002
           (shouting)

09:47.045 --> 09:47.794
                (shouting)

09:47.838 --> 09:49.004
       (shouting)
                (shouting)

09:49.047 --> 09:51.298
                      (shouting)

09:51.341 --> 09:53.842
        Ala'a Shehabi:
         <i> Since 2011,</i>
    <i> Bahrain has witnessed</i>

09:53.885 --> 09:55.802
    some of the largest
    protests in its history.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.012
     <i> There are thousands</i>
     <i> of protesters</i>

09:57.055 --> 09:59.806
    <i> taking to the streets</i>
    <i> who are demanding</i>

09:59.850 --> 10:03.268
   <i> more democratic reforms</i>
   <i> and a change in regime.</i>

10:04.938 --> 10:07.355
   Smith: <i> Ala'a Shehabi is</i>
    <i> a Bahraini activist</i>

10:07.399 --> 10:10.734
  <i> who found herself the target</i>
  <i> of government surveillance.</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:12.819
        In 2012, I was
        briefly arrested.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.487
        Immediately after
        I was released,

10:14.531 --> 10:18.033
     <i> I received a string</i>
     <i> of four or five emails</i>

10:18.076 --> 10:20.285
  <i> that were very suspicious</i>
  <i> to me.</i>

10:20.329 --> 10:22.037
    <i> I suspected that</i>
    <i> this was a cyber attack,</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:23.330
  <i> and so I immediately sent</i>

10:23.373 --> 10:25.665
    <i> the suspicious emails</i>

10:25.709 --> 10:27.500
   <i> to my colleague,</i>
   <i> Morgan, at Citizen Lab.</i>

10:27.544 --> 10:30.295
     <i> It actually turned out</i>
     <i> that this spyware was</i>

10:30.339 --> 10:33.840
   produced and operated
   by a British-German company

10:33.884 --> 10:35.300
      <i> called FinFisher.</i>

10:35.344 --> 10:37.177
<i>This is a company</i>
 <i> that specializes</i>

10:37.220 --> 10:38.553
<i>in producing</i>
<i>hacking software,</i>

10:38.597 --> 10:40.472
<i>and it claims that</i>
<i>it sells them</i>

10:40.515 --> 10:41.890
<i>to government</i>
<i>regimes,</i>

10:41.933 --> 10:44.851
<i>so that</i>
<i>immediately fitted</i>
<i>with my suspicion</i>

10:44.895 --> 10:45.935
<i>that this was</i>
<i>the Bahraini</i>
<i>regime.</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.896
    <i> The spyware's capable</i>
    <i> of switching</i>

10:47.939 --> 10:50.940
     <i> your microphone on,</i>
     <i> your camera,</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:52.442
   <i> it's capable of logging</i>

10:52.486 --> 10:53.860
       <i> every single thing</i>
       <i> that you type.</i>

10:53.904 --> 10:57.572
   <i> There are a handful</i>
   <i> of key companies in Europe</i>

10:57.616 --> 11:00.283
   <i> that are openly marketing,</i>

11:00.327 --> 11:02.369
     promoting, and selling
     these tools

11:02.412 --> 11:04.662
       in arms exhibitions

11:04.706 --> 11:06.581
    <i> in European capitals.</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:08.500
   <i> They are not being used</i>

11:08.543 --> 11:09.584
     <i> in the name</i>
     <i> of tackling terrorism.</i>

11:09.628 --> 11:12.295
   They are being used to keep

11:12.339 --> 11:14.297
     these regimes in place
     and in power.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.132
            Smith:
     <i> Now, to see exactly</i>

11:16.176 --> 11:18.718
   <i> what type of information</i>
  <i> a hacked phone can yield,</i>

11:18.762 --> 11:19.886
  <i> we contacted the same hacker</i>

11:19.930 --> 11:22.514
      <i> who uncovered</i>
      <i> the Bahraini scandal</i>

11:22.557 --> 11:25.141
  <i> and asked him to hack</i>
  <i> one of our own reporters</i>

11:25.185 --> 11:27.060
        <i> using the same</i>
        <i> type of software</i>

11:27.104 --> 11:29.020
<i>that targeted Ala'a Shehabi's.</i>

11:29.064 --> 11:32.857
   <i> We were able to completely</i>
   <i> commandeer Ben's phone</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:34.442
     <i> and he never knew it.</i>

11:34.486 --> 11:37.654
                 Smith:
         <i> So Ben was in Pakistan</i>
        <i> doing a shoot on polio.</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:39.364
         So you hacked his phone

11:39.408 --> 11:41.116
             and you figured out
             who he called.
   Right, and so,

11:41.159 --> 11:42.367
I mean, what we've got here

11:42.411 --> 11:43.868
         is I can see, you know,
         who he's calling

11:43.912 --> 11:46.246
    and when he called them
    and how long the calls were.
Wow.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.957
  We can actually
  record his calls.
                 Wow.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.125
Let's have a listen to them.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.639
This will also keep a list
of Ben's web browsing history.
                   Wow.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.182
  Um, and so for instance,
  you can see here

12:06.226 --> 12:07.684
           he's Google searching
           for BBC,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.436
       you can see news articles
       that he's writing.
  Right.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.938
       Checking his Twitter.
       It's sort of like reading
       someone's mind

12:11.982 --> 12:13.857
 <i> 'cause you can sort of see</i>
 <i> what they're thinking</i>
 <i> while they're on the Internet.</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:16.609
          So we've been
          location tracking Ben.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.778
             You can even
             get it to animate,
             and so it will show

12:18.822 --> 12:21.531
where Ben-- Ben is
at various sort of times.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.408
<i>You can see him traveling</i>
<i>around the city there</i>
                          <i> Sure.</i>

12:23.452 --> 12:25.410
<i>and you can tell</i>
<i>exactly where he is</i>
                         <i> Right.</i>

12:25.454 --> 12:27.036
which is obviously,
in terms of keeping

12:27.080 --> 12:28.163
tabs on someone,
a highly desirable thing.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.789
               ¶ ¶

12:33.211 --> 12:34.043
Marquis-Boire:
<i>Think about anything</i>

12:34.087 --> 12:36.421
that the phone can do.
                  Mm.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.173
 Right. Like, once
 you've actually installed

12:38.216 --> 12:40.341
  this malicious software
  on the phone,
                    Mm.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.551
then it's simply
a matter of activating

12:41.595 --> 12:44.179
<i>the phone's capabilities.</i>

12:44.222 --> 12:45.305
<i>So, I mean, the phone has</i>
<i>a camera, right?</i>

12:45.348 --> 12:47.140
<i>Well, now we can</i>
<i>turn on the camera.</i>

12:50.020 --> 12:51.769
  What are these
  ambient recordings?
                  And so--

12:51.813 --> 12:52.562
           Yeah, so the ambient
           recording if kind of

12:52.606 --> 12:54.647
the invisible microphone.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.108
       The-- the real
       sort of spy stuff.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.828
            So he's interviewing
            a Gitmo detainee--

13:08.872 --> 13:10.747
   a former Gitmo de-- detainee.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.999
   So I guess when you talk
   about protecting journalists,

13:13.043 --> 13:16.044
         <i> protecting your source</i>
         <i> is a big issue.</i>

13:16.087 --> 13:18.421
<i>Can you be said</i>
<i>to be practicing journalism</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:21.508
   in a traditional sense
   if you can't guarantee
   source protection?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.301
You may be sort of
actively endangering

13:23.345 --> 13:25.428
the-- their livelihood,
welfare, and life.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.640
   Now with software like this
   and the other more

13:28.683 --> 13:30.350
          commercially available
          software,

13:30.393 --> 13:34.521
             it seems like
             technology allows

13:34.564 --> 13:37.941
           almost anyone to spy
           on almost anyone.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.401
We live in a golden age
of convenience

13:40.445 --> 13:42.946
enabled by technology,
and so that means that,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.448
you know, y-- you and I can be
on other sides of the planet

13:45.492 --> 13:47.450
<i>and we can have</i>
<i>a conversation in real time</i>

13:47.494 --> 13:48.868
<i>for-- for no money.</i>

13:48.912 --> 13:51.329
Technology has enabled
convenience of communication,

13:51.373 --> 13:54.040
but also convenience
of surveillance.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.917
   Smith: <i> Now, this so called</i>
    <i> golden age of technology</i>

13:55.961 --> 13:58.836
        <i> has essentially</i>
        <i> made it possible</i>

13:58.880 --> 14:01.256
      <i> for anyone to spy</i>
      <i> on anyone else.</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:03.341
      <i> It begs the question,</i>
      <i> can people,</i>

14:03.385 --> 14:05.760
  <i> for example, journalists,</i>
  <i> ever go dark?</i>

14:05.804 --> 14:10.056
  <i> Is that even possible now</i>
  <i> with these new advancements?</i>

14:10.100 --> 14:12.308
How do we go black?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.311
        Well, so going black
        is a-- a pretty big ask.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.606
   For me, for example,
   I really know what I'm doing.
    Yeah.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.775
            But if the NSA wants
            to pop my box,
         Uh-huh.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.110
       you know, they're totally
       gonna do it.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.903
   But if you know
   you're actively under threat,

14:23.947 --> 14:25.863
          if you know your phone
          has been hacked,

14:25.907 --> 14:27.615
             these are ways
             that you can ensure

14:27.659 --> 14:29.534
   that your phone works for you
Yeah.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.994
             rather than working
             for somebody else.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.413
  You might've bought the phone,
  but whoever hacked it,

14:33.456 --> 14:35.248
    they're the ones
    who own it.
Wow.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.541
             Smith:
  <i> That's because third parties</i>

14:36.585 --> 14:38.710
    <i> can actually turn on</i>
    <i> your phone's microphones</i>

14:38.753 --> 14:40.253
   <i> and cameras</i>
   <i> without you knowing it.</i>

14:40.297 --> 14:43.590
  Any device that's on here,
  you can operate independently.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.008
So, it's true you can
get into the phone

14:45.051 --> 14:46.134
and turn the camera on?
    Yeah, absolutely.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.386
  So, you would turn this guy on
      (beep)

14:48.430 --> 14:51.598
   and you'll just heat that guy
   until the solder is molten.

14:51.641 --> 14:55.685
     Notice I'm gonna be
     detaching the ribbon cables

14:55.729 --> 14:58.313
             that are connecting
             the camera.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.565
      As a surface mount device,
      you'll be able to

15:00.609 --> 15:02.275
     just pull it off like that.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.736
So this is the camera.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.988
What's that?
    This is the other camera.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.281
       You got two cameras
       in your phone.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.657
       You got your
       front-facing camera

15:09.701 --> 15:11.117
    for sort of the selfies,

15:11.161 --> 15:13.161
   and you got your
   rear-facing camera that's--

15:13.204 --> 15:16.205
       I think this one has
       a multi-microphone array,
Mm.

15:16.249 --> 15:20.668
     which is gonna be this guy,
     this guy, and this guy.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.171
But if you take out
the microphones,

15:23.214 --> 15:26.549
then how do you use it
as a phone?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.969
   You would add
   your own external microphone.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.597
           For example,
           the iPod type earbuds

15:32.641 --> 15:35.099
      that have the mic
      integrated on the lanyard.
Right. Built in.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.810
 Is there a way you can tell
if your phone's been hacked?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.270
      Perhaps the most
      terrifying thing is,

15:39.314 --> 15:41.147
  if your phone had been hacked,
  you would never know.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.567
             Smith:
     <i> And as "VICE" reporter</i>
      <i> Jason Leopold found,</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:47.278
   <i> surveillance has become</i>
   <i> so ubiquitous</i>

15:47.322 --> 15:48.780
   <i> that even</i>
   <i> the government agencies</i>

15:48.823 --> 15:50.239
 <i> responsible for policing it</i>

15:50.283 --> 15:51.783
       <i> are not secure.</i>

15:51.826 --> 15:53.284
You got a FOIA request

15:53.328 --> 15:56.996
recently in the mail
that's causing quite a stir.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.665
              The way that
              this all surfaced,

15:58.708 --> 16:00.458
      Dianne Feinstein, she made

16:00.502 --> 16:02.168
            this extraordinary
            Floor speech.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.462
           Smith:
 <i> As the head of the Senate</i>
  <i> Intelligence Committee,</i>

16:04.506 --> 16:07.340
   <i> Feinstein delivered</i>
   <i> some shocking allegations.</i>

16:07.384 --> 16:08.800
          Feinstein:
      <i> On two occasions,</i>

16:08.843 --> 16:12.762
     CIA personnel
     electronically removed

16:12.806 --> 16:16.349
        Committee access
        to CIA documents.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.644
              She said that
              the CIA had hacked

16:19.688 --> 16:23.648
           into Senate computers
           while these staffers

16:23.692 --> 16:26.317
           who work for her
           were writing a report

16:26.361 --> 16:27.944
              about the CIA's
             torture program.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.862
        <i> John Brennan,</i>
        <i> the director of the CIA</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:31.906
     <i> said that is preposterous.</i>

16:31.950 --> 16:33.449
            Our only way to look
            deeper into it

16:33.493 --> 16:36.661
     was to file a Freedom
     of Information Act request.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.539
           <i> So, these documents</i>
           <i> absolutely backed up</i>

16:39.582 --> 16:42.750
         <i> everything that</i>
         <i> Dianne Feinstein said.</i>

16:42.794 --> 16:43.876
            <i> What's most</i>
            <i> interesting though,</i>

16:43.920 --> 16:45.586
              <i> what I would call</i>
              <i> a smoking gun,</i>

16:45.630 --> 16:48.089
    <i> John Brennan wrote a letter</i>
    <i> and he said that</i>

16:48.133 --> 16:51.884
            <i> the CIA staff had</i>
            <i> improperly accessed</i>
            <i> your computers.</i>

16:51.928 --> 16:54.804
          But John Brennan
          never sent this letter

16:54.848 --> 16:55.972
            to Dianne Feinstein.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.849
  They said that this letter was

16:57.892 --> 16:59.600
              was mistakenly
              turned over to us.
        Right.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.810
             It was an accident,
             and it actually

17:00.854 --> 17:04.230
        should not have been
        released to us, and, uh,

17:04.273 --> 17:05.857
         they asked us not to,

17:05.900 --> 17:06.941
                    uh, post it.
Because it's embarrassing.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.109
         Completely embarrassing
         for them.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.695
            And we declined
            that, uh, request

17:11.740 --> 17:14.574
      because there's no
      national security concerns
      in this letter.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.117
   This is simply something that

17:16.161 --> 17:17.952
       John Brennan did not want

17:17.996 --> 17:19.162
         the public to see
         after making all these,

17:19.204 --> 17:22.707
        uh, statements about
        what the CIA did not do.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.292
             Smith:
        <i> We now know that</i>

17:25.336 --> 17:28.880
<i>the CIA officers were in fact</i>
<i>spying on the committee</i>

17:28.923 --> 17:30.339
      <i> charged with keeping</i>
      <i> them in line.</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:32.049
   <i> So, we spoke to one</i>
   <i> of those committee members,</i>

17:32.093 --> 17:35.303
       <i> Senator Ron Wyden,</i>
       <i> about the letter</i>

17:35.346 --> 17:38.097
    <i> that Brennan never meant</i>
    <i> to send.</i>

17:38.141 --> 17:41.684
  This will be the first time
  I've ever said this publicly.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.855
  My sense is
  there were clearly people

17:45.899 --> 17:49.859
      at the CIA
      who understood

17:49.903 --> 17:53.237
that what Mr. Brennan had done

17:53.281 --> 17:55.698
   was flat out wrong,

17:55.742 --> 17:59.410
    and they drafted
    an apology letter.

17:59.454 --> 18:04.540
      <i> And yet, Mr. Brennan</i>
      <i> was just unwilling</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:07.585
   <i> to publicly acknowledge</i>
   <i> wrongdoing.</i>

18:07.629 --> 18:11.214
     This is basically
    rewriting the law.

18:11.257 --> 18:16.219
  We are the agency
  that is required by law

18:16.262 --> 18:18.638
  to conduct vigorous oversight

18:18.681 --> 18:20.264
          over the CIA.

18:20.308 --> 18:24.644
 We can't do vigorous oversight
 over the agency

18:24.687 --> 18:27.438
      if the agency
      we're supposed to
      be overseeing

18:27.482 --> 18:31.943
  is in fact, uh,
  secretly searching our files.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.654
           Smith:
     <i> Now, Senator Wyden</i>

18:34.697 --> 18:36.989
    <i> has become a leader</i>
    <i> in attempting to rein in</i>

18:37.033 --> 18:39.575
<i>our Intelligence Community.</i>
Wyden: Director Clapper,

18:39.619 --> 18:40.827
   I want to ask you about...

18:40.870 --> 18:42.703
            Snowden:
    <i> Senator Ron Wyden said,</i>

18:42.747 --> 18:47.333
   <i> "Is the NSA collecting</i>
  <i> any kind of data at all</i>

18:47.377 --> 18:50.002
   <i> on millions or hundreds</i>
   <i> of millions of Americans?"</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:53.923
       And James Clapper sort of

18:53.967 --> 18:55.466
           scratched his head...

18:55.510 --> 18:57.927
     No, sir.
              <i> and he said no...</i>

18:57.971 --> 18:58.553
          It does not?
                   <i> they do not.</i>

18:58.596 --> 19:01.305
         Not wittingly.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.182
    <i> The most senior</i>
    <i> Intelligence official</i>

19:03.226 --> 19:04.684
      <i> in the United States</i>
      <i> of America</i>

19:04.727 --> 19:06.394
            raised his hand
            and swore an oath

19:06.437 --> 19:10.439
  to tell the truth to Congress,
  and he lied on camera.
  Mm-hmm.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.775
   He wasn't charged,
   despite the fact that he--

19:12.819 --> 19:13.818
           that's a felony.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.528
    He didn't even lose his job.
Mm-hmm.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.363
          <i> He's still doing</i>
          <i> the same thing today.</i>

19:17.407 --> 19:19.615
       Within a few months,
       he admitted that he lied.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.326
          He said his answer was
           "too cute by half"...

19:22.370 --> 19:25.621
   <i> Mm.</i>
           <i> and the least</i>
           <i> untruthful statement</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:27.373
     <i> that he felt he could have</i>
     <i> made at the time.</i>
   <i> Mm.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:31.961
   My view is that
   if you're going to protect

19:32.005 --> 19:33.546
      the American people,

19:33.590 --> 19:37.425
   you've gotta embed
   those protections into law.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.887
And we of course
have been very concerned

19:40.930 --> 19:42.638
about with what I call
secret law.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.183
    Smith: <i> And at the heart</i>
 <i> of that secret law is FISA,</i>

19:46.227 --> 19:47.560
    <i> the Foreign Intelligence</i>
    <i> Surveillance Act,</i>

19:47.604 --> 19:51.522
  <i> which authorized</i>
  <i> secret courts to green-light</i>

19:51.566 --> 19:53.190
  <i> domestic spying programs.</i>

19:53.234 --> 19:56.193
             Wyden:
    <i> The government persuaded</i>
       <i> the court to say,</i>

19:56.237 --> 19:59.864
     <i> "Well, it's okay</i>
     <i> to collect meta data."</i>

19:59.908 --> 20:01.699
      When you read
      the fundamental law,

20:01.743 --> 20:03.534
      you hear anything
      about meta data

20:03.578 --> 20:06.245
       and collecting
       millions of records

20:06.289 --> 20:09.415
      on law abiding,
      uh, people.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.459
  That was all done in secret.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.545
And in fact, I went
to the floor of the Senate

20:14.589 --> 20:18.132
 and I warned that
 when the American people

20:18.176 --> 20:23.054
 found out how that law
 had been secretly interpreted,

20:23.097 --> 20:25.806
 they would be very angry,
 and that in fact was the case.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.433
      (indistinct chanting)

20:27.477 --> 20:28.768
   Smith: <i> Now, public anger</i>
  <i> hasn't been enough to end</i>

20:28.811 --> 20:31.771
   <i> many of these programs,</i>
   <i> but increasingly,</i>

20:31.814 --> 20:33.064
   <i> the question isn't whether</i>

20:33.107 --> 20:33.981
      <i> or not they can be</i>
      <i> justified under law,</i>

20:34.025 --> 20:36.651
<i>but whether they're actually</i>

20:36.694 --> 20:38.110
<i>effective in the first place.</i>

20:38.154 --> 20:40.279
Smith: <i> Recently there were</i>

20:40.323 --> 20:42.365
<i>attacks in Paris.</i>

20:42.408 --> 20:45.826
What happens when you have
a terrorist attack like that

20:45.870 --> 20:47.578
within security agencies,

20:47.622 --> 20:48.913
       with the NSA,
       for example?

20:48.957 --> 20:50.915
            I was working,
            uh, at the NSA

20:50.959 --> 20:53.751
      during the Boston Marathon
      bombings investigation,

20:53.795 --> 20:56.420
<i>and as it was playing</i>
<i>on the news,</i>

20:56.464 --> 20:59.215
<i>myself and colleagues</i>
<i>were in the cafeteria,</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.175
     and we turned to each other

21:01.219 --> 21:04.720
          and said,
          "I'll bet you anything

21:04.764 --> 21:06.722
<i>"we already knew</i>
<i>about these guys</i>

21:06.766 --> 21:08.933
<i>in the databases."</i>
<i>And in Paris,</i>

21:08.977 --> 21:11.644
I'm certain that the same
conversation happened.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.855
   And this is really the legacy
   of mass surveillance,

21:14.899 --> 21:17.358
 is the fact that
 when you're watching everyone,

21:17.402 --> 21:18.943
         you know who
         these individuals are.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.070
           They're in the banks.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.572
         You had the information
         you needed to stop,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.866
           to prevent even
           the worst atrocities.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.159
            But the problem is

21:27.203 --> 21:30.746
            when you cast
            the net too wide,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.415
     when you're collecting
     everything,

21:32.458 --> 21:33.582
         you understand nothing.

21:33.626 --> 21:38.421
        We know for a fact
        that it is not effective

21:38.464 --> 21:40.631
  for stopping terrorist attacks
  and it never has been.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.299
               ¶ ¶

21:42.343 --> 21:44.427
      <i> The White House appointed</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:45.720
    <i> two independent commissions</i>

21:45.763 --> 21:47.805
  <i> in the wake of my disclosures</i>
  <i> in 2013</i>

21:47.849 --> 21:50.725
     to review mass surveillance
     programs and go,

21:50.768 --> 21:52.810
            "All right,
            do these have value?

21:52.854 --> 21:54.687
      Should they be changed?
      Should they the reformed?"

21:54.731 --> 21:56.480
    They looked at the evidence,

21:56.524 --> 21:57.648
        the classified evidence,

21:57.692 --> 22:01.027
         and they found,
         wow, despite the fact

22:01.070 --> 22:03.404
         that this had been
         going on since 2001,

22:03.448 --> 22:06.407
      it had never stopped
      a single terrorist attack

22:06.451 --> 22:07.742
          <i> in the United States.</i>

22:07.785 --> 22:10.578
   <i> And that's after</i>
   <i> monitoring the phone calls</i>

22:10.621 --> 22:11.620
     of everyone in the country.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.913
So, that's a huge point.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.458
So, two independent
commissions started

22:15.501 --> 22:17.501
by the White House said

22:17.545 --> 22:21.088
mass surveillance has not
stopped a terrorist attack.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.465
          And both of them found
          that these programs

22:22.508 --> 22:26.177
           should be ended,
           and then they came up

22:26.220 --> 22:29.805
       with 42 different points,
       uh, for a reform

22:29.849 --> 22:32.016
       that they recommended
       should happen to restrict

22:32.060 --> 22:33.267
        the use of these powers.
        Mm.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.811
         The last time that
         I saw a review of this,

22:35.855 --> 22:38.814
      the President only adopted
      three of the 42 points.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.232
Why?
        Because they would limit

22:40.276 --> 22:43.819
             the exercise
             of executive power.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.530
         <i> This is something that</i>
         <i> you have to understand</i>

22:46.574 --> 22:47.948
   <i> is not about this president.</i>

22:47.992 --> 22:50.409
     <i> It's about the presidency.</i>

22:50.453 --> 22:52.578
             <i> It's clear that</i>
             <i> the public opposes</i>

22:52.622 --> 22:54.497
  <i> a majority of these policies,</i>
  <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:56.916
            and yet politicians,
            because the word

22:56.959 --> 22:58.626
       "terrorism" is involved,
        Mm.

22:58.669 --> 23:02.338
    uh, they can't justify being
    the one to stand, uh, up

23:02.381 --> 23:04.632
               and mal the vote
               because they know

23:04.675 --> 23:05.341
        there will be
        another terrorist attack

23:05.384 --> 23:07.343
'Cause if they say no,

23:07.386 --> 23:08.886
we're gonna--
we're gonna stop doing this,

23:08.930 --> 23:10.221
and then there's
a terrorist attack,

23:10.264 --> 23:11.806
   they get painted
   with that brush.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.808
   They know they'll be blamed
   by their political opponents,

23:13.851 --> 23:15.226
       and they're right.
Mm.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.436
       Of course their political
       opponents will do this.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.604
     It's the easting thing
     in the world to do.
Mm-hmm.

23:18.648 --> 23:21.232
        Uh, and unfortunately,
        it's quite effective

23:21.275 --> 23:23.984
    because we live in a time
   where the politics of fear

23:24.028 --> 23:26.737
        <i> are the most persuasive</i>
        <i> thing on the table.</i>

23:26.781 --> 23:29.073
            Smith:
    <i> Now, while the debate</i>
      <i> over surveillance</i>

23:29.117 --> 23:30.825
      <i> continues to rage</i>
      <i> here in the US,</i>

23:30.868 --> 23:32.868
             <i> Edward Snowden</i>
             <i> remains a fugitive</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:35.329
           <i> for his revelations</i>
           <i> about the NSA,</i>

23:35.373 --> 23:36.205
     <i> and he had</i>
     <i> a cautionary statement</i>

23:36.249 --> 23:38.874
     <i> about what's at stake.</i>

23:38.918 --> 23:40.835
When the world was
first introduced to you,

23:40.878 --> 23:42.419
you made a statement

23:42.463 --> 23:45.047
about turn-key tyranny.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.924
What did you mean by that?

23:46.968 --> 23:49.718
           It means that
           even if you trust
           the government today,

23:49.762 --> 23:51.011
           what happens
           when it changes?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.597
          In-- in our democracy,
           we're never more than

23:53.641 --> 23:55.099
             eight years away
             from a total change
             of government.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.852
   Mm-hmm.
             Suddenly...

23:57.895 --> 24:00.521
     everybody's vulnerable
     to this individual,

24:00.565 --> 24:02.231
       and the systems are
       already in place.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.025
          What happens tomorrow,

24:05.069 --> 24:05.943
                   in a year,

24:05.987 --> 24:07.945
              in five years,
              in ten years

24:07.989 --> 24:10.030
         when eventually we get
         an individual who says,

24:10.074 --> 24:13.284
        "You know what?
        Let's flip that switch

24:13.327 --> 24:14.827
          "and use the absolute,

24:14.871 --> 24:18.747
   "full extent of our technical
   capabilities to ensure

24:18.791 --> 24:22.918
    the political stability
    of this new administration"?

24:22.962 --> 24:25.045
      (indistinct chanting)

24:25.089 --> 24:27.173
                When we think
                about the future

24:27.216 --> 24:28.924
      and where we go from here,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.759
               <i> the question is</i>

24:30.803 --> 24:33.053
       <i> are we going to change</i>

24:33.097 --> 24:35.723
             <i> and enter sort of</i>
             <i> a quantified world</i>

24:35.766 --> 24:36.515
              <i> where everywhere</i>
              <i> you've been,</i>

24:36.559 --> 24:39.059
         <i> everyone you talk to,</i>

24:39.103 --> 24:40.686
                 it's indexed,
                it's analyzed,

24:40.730 --> 24:43.522
               it's stored,
               and it's used...

24:43.566 --> 24:45.065
            maybe against you...

24:45.109 --> 24:46.192
Within our technologies here,

24:46.235 --> 24:47.651
we have our license plate
reader system,

24:47.695 --> 24:48.986
which we can capture

24:49.030 --> 24:51.488
dozens of license plates
in the matter of a second.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.282
         ...or will we recognize

24:53.326 --> 24:55.910
            the danger of that
            and embrace the fact

24:55.953 --> 24:57.536
   that people should have space

24:57.580 --> 25:00.664
            to make mistakes
            without judgment,

25:00.708 --> 25:03.083
        to have sort of
        the unconsidered thought

25:03.127 --> 25:04.460
            or conversation
            with your friend?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.962
        But if that was recorded
        in a database

25:07.006 --> 25:09.840
            where, you know,
            now you say,

25:09.884 --> 25:11.884
  "I think Donald Trump
  should be kicked off a cliff,"

25:11.928 --> 25:14.720
   uh, and Donald Trump
   becomes president someday,
     Sure

25:14.764 --> 25:17.598
     and everybody
     who said that ends up
     getting thrown off a cliff?

25:17.642 --> 25:18.557
                  Uh...

25:19.810 --> 25:21.060
  That's a very dangerous world.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.980
      And I think this really is
      the question that

25:25.024 --> 25:26.774
        our political structures

25:26.817 --> 25:31.278
         are not yet comfortable
         even discussing.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.782
          But whether
          they like it or not,

25:34.825 --> 25:36.492
   it's a world that's coming

25:36.535 --> 25:38.619
            and we're going to
             have to confront.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.329
