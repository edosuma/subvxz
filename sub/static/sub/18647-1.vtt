WEBVTT

00:28.738 --> 00:29.948
Morning, Doctor.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.033
Good morning, Charles.
You're looking splendid.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.576
I feel splendid.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.620
Every day, and in every way,
you're feeling

00:35.829 --> 00:37.789
Better and better.

00:37.998 --> 00:40.417
- Indeed.
- Well, won't you sit here?

00:42.252 --> 00:43.712
Wouldn't you like me to...

00:44.421 --> 00:45.964
Not unless you want to.

00:46.172 --> 00:49.592
No. I'll be quite
comfortable here. Thank you.

00:52.512 --> 00:54.639
Doctor, I'm surprised.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.767
Oh, of course. You--
you quit.

00:58.852 --> 01:00.395
Three months ago.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.773
You know, there was a time
when your forgetfulness

01:03.982 --> 01:06.026
would have made me feel
very rejected.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.152
Not now, hmm?

01:07.360 --> 01:10.113
Well, a little rejected,
perhaps.

01:10.321 --> 01:13.700
- Did you do it intentionally?
- Why should I do that?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.410
Well, uh,

01:15.618 --> 01:19.122
I'm a patient you consider to
be completely rehabilitated

01:19.330 --> 01:22.876
on your recommendation soon to
appear before the sanity board

01:23.084 --> 01:25.211
your reputation on the line.

01:25.587 --> 01:28.173
A little test, perhaps, hmm?

01:28.757 --> 01:31.009
Not very long ago,
an obvious trick like that

01:31.217 --> 01:33.261
would have sent you
into a towering rage.

01:33.470 --> 01:36.139
And poor old Clouseau
would have silently

01:36.347 --> 01:38.808
and passively submitted
to another massacre.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.187
It's a miracle you were
somehow able

01:42.395 --> 01:43.897
to keep putting him
back together again.

01:45.732 --> 01:47.400
Poor old Clouseau.

01:48.443 --> 01:52.238
There was a time when I
couldn't even speak his name.

01:52.447 --> 01:53.573
And there was also a time

01:53.782 --> 01:55.825
when you would
joyfully have killed him.

01:56.034 --> 01:57.368
Yes.

01:58.995 --> 02:01.206
- I was a sick man, wasn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.334
We've come a long way,
haven't we?

02:04.542 --> 02:06.461
And you're not even a little bit
bothered

02:06.669 --> 02:08.505
when you think of Clouseau?

02:08.713 --> 02:10.465
Not even a little bit.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.260
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so.

02:14.469 --> 02:16.304
Well, I could be lying.

02:16.513 --> 02:19.015
You are a good psychiatrist,
but I may be a better liar.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.018
For your sake,
I hope you're not.

02:22.936 --> 02:25.897
Sooner or later, you'd
run into Clouseau, and then

02:26.397 --> 02:28.191
<i>back here for life.</i>

02:28.399 --> 02:31.111
No more chance
of another hearing.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.570
Coming here day after day,

02:32.779 --> 02:35.490
watching you chain smoke
yourself into an early grave

02:35.698 --> 02:37.700
<i>and knowing that
on certain mornings,</i>

02:37.909 --> 02:40.161
<i>you'll be particularly
morose and testy</i>

02:40.370 --> 02:42.997
because you've had another fight
with your wife

02:43.206 --> 02:45.041
like this morning.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.837
- How do you know that?
- It's the only time you doodle.

02:51.714 --> 02:55.009
I keep forgetting you used to be
chief inspector of the Sûreté.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.761
And will be again.

02:57.428 --> 03:00.306
But Clouseau
is chief inspector now.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.892
Till the better man comes along.

03:03.101 --> 03:06.646
Well, in that case,
I think Inspector Clouseau

03:06.855 --> 03:09.149
had better
start looking to his laurels.

03:10.441 --> 03:12.944
What? You mean...?

03:14.154 --> 03:16.865
The board meets at 2:00
this afternoon.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.325
This afternoon?

03:19.534 --> 03:21.202
If everything goes
as I expect it to,

03:21.411 --> 03:23.246
you'll be out of here
this afternoon.

03:27.292 --> 03:28.751
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.711
See you at 2:00.

03:32.964 --> 03:34.007
Clouseau!

03:36.342 --> 03:37.760
Now, now, Doctor.

03:37.969 --> 03:41.973
Some people would consider
your methods most unorthodox.

03:42.182 --> 03:43.016
I was just making sure

03:43.224 --> 03:45.476
that you're not a better liar
than I am a psychiatrist.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.438
2:00.

03:57.697 --> 04:00.700
<i>Come along. Good.</i>

04:09.500 --> 04:10.877
How.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.660
Help! Help!

04:44.494 --> 04:46.704
Help! Help!

04:47.455 --> 04:50.583
Grab hold of this.
Pull. Pull on this.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.547
<i>Help!</i>

04:56.756 --> 05:00.093
<i>Help! Help!</i>

05:13.523 --> 05:15.566
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

05:15.775 --> 05:18.111
<i>Out with the bad air,
in with the good.</i>

05:18.528 --> 05:20.154
Out, in.

05:20.321 --> 05:23.324
- Don't look, Fiona!
<i>- Out, out.</i>

05:23.533 --> 05:27.287
And now the kiss of life.

05:30.123 --> 05:30.665
Pervert!

05:36.254 --> 05:38.423
- Dirty old men!
- Oh...

05:45.596 --> 05:46.472
Clouseau.

05:47.098 --> 05:49.767
Please, there is no need
to thank me.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.770
- Thank you?
- For saving your life.

05:52.979 --> 05:54.605
Someone...

05:54.814 --> 05:56.274
I was hit on the head.

05:56.482 --> 06:00.028
Yes, you have received a beump
upon the head.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.571
- "Beump"?
- What?

06:01.779 --> 06:04.115
- You said "beump."
- Yes, I know that.

06:04.324 --> 06:06.242
It is a large beump.

06:06.451 --> 06:09.037
You could receive a concussion
from such a beump.

06:09.245 --> 06:11.080
- Allow me to assist you.
- No!

06:12.540 --> 06:15.043
I'm all right. I'm fine.

06:15.251 --> 06:19.130
Never better.
Just a little-- a little shaky.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.132
Probably the shock of--
I mean,

06:21.341 --> 06:24.093
the surprise of seeing
you here again today.

06:24.302 --> 06:27.055
Well, I received a report

06:27.263 --> 06:29.057
from the sanity commission

06:29.265 --> 06:31.309
that they were going
to review your case today

06:31.517 --> 06:34.979
so I thought a few words from me
on your behalf

06:35.188 --> 06:35.980
Oh, God

06:36.189 --> 06:39.484
I mean,
how generous of you, but

06:39.692 --> 06:42.070
Well, I'm not without influence,
you know.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.780
Yes, I know that.

06:43.988 --> 06:48.159
Yes, I have become
a rather important official

06:48.368 --> 06:49.619
in the department.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.538
I've heard. You are the new
chief inspector.

06:53.498 --> 06:54.874
Yes.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.250
Yes, yes.

06:57.293 --> 06:58.711
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.090
Yes, yes.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.969
Yes, we made quite a few changes
since you went crazy.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.138
For the better, I'm sure.

07:10.390 --> 07:14.185
By the way, Sergeant Chevalier
sends you his kind regards.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.978
Oh, Sergeant Chevalier.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.941
Good old Sergeant Chevalier.
How is he, anyway?

07:21.067 --> 07:21.943
Well, you know,

07:22.110 --> 07:24.404
there are leaders
and there are followers.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.321
Mmm.

07:25.530 --> 07:27.698
and I'm afraid that
Sergeant Chevalier

07:27.907 --> 07:29.450
will always be a follower, no?

07:29.659 --> 07:30.827
Oh, yes.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.997
And you, my friend Clouseau,
a leader, huh?

07:35.206 --> 07:36.040
Well

07:36.249 --> 07:37.500
Always a leader?

07:37.708 --> 07:40.878
Onwards and upwards
to the top, hmm?

07:41.337 --> 07:43.256
- It is my karma.
- What?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.716
- My destiny.
- Oh, yes.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.429
Yes, a few more years
on the force

07:49.637 --> 07:53.558
and I might even be persuaded
to run for the public office.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.562
You can count on my vote.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.898
And you, my friend,
can count on me

08:01.107 --> 08:04.235
to do everything in my power
to get you out of this place.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.905
Oh, yes. I know how you feel.

08:09.282 --> 08:11.284
My hat. Well...

08:21.377 --> 08:23.963
Are you all right,
former Chief Inspector?

08:24.172 --> 08:25.506
Yes!

08:26.591 --> 08:30.094
Yes, I'm--
I'm perfectly all right.

08:30.303 --> 08:31.679
See?

08:42.398 --> 08:45.443
One moment,
and I will have you extracted.

08:45.818 --> 08:48.196
I'm fine. I am perfect.

08:49.447 --> 08:52.074
Every day, and in every way

08:52.283 --> 08:54.744
I'm getting better and better.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.580
<i>♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪</i>

09:00.208 --> 09:03.669
I'm afraid that this
is just not your day, my friend.

09:03.878 --> 09:06.005
But it is my day.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.466
It is, my friend.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.177
After three long,
terrible years

09:11.385 --> 09:13.179
it is at last my day.

09:13.387 --> 09:17.016
I will not permit,
repeat, not permit, anything,

09:17.225 --> 09:19.519
repeat,
anything, to spoil it.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.688
Now, I will walk you
to the gate

09:22.897 --> 09:25.107
and I will kiss you good-bye

09:26.734 --> 09:29.570
and you will drive off
in your new car

09:29.779 --> 09:31.781
which should
rightfully be mine

09:31.989 --> 09:33.658
and then I will have
my interview

09:33.866 --> 09:35.326
with the sanity commission.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.329
And they will set me free,
and then

09:39.497 --> 09:40.706
I will kill you.

09:41.874 --> 09:44.669
<i>- Kill you!</i>
- Francois!

09:44.877 --> 09:46.921
<i>- Kill you!
- Start the car!</i>

09:47.255 --> 09:50.466
Kill! Kill! Kill!

09:52.176 --> 09:54.095
Kill you! Kill!

10:01.477 --> 10:02.770
I'll kill him!

10:06.691 --> 10:08.734
I want to kill him!

10:12.446 --> 10:14.323
I've got to kill him.

13:47.578 --> 13:48.579
Oh, allow me.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.517
Cato?

14:12.770 --> 14:14.104
Cato?

15:44.820 --> 15:46.238
Ya-ha!

16:29.406 --> 16:31.283
Forty winks.

17:32.428 --> 17:33.470
Aha!

19:25.582 --> 19:27.000
It's the phone.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.005
The phone is ringing.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.973
Relax. I'll get it.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.937
This is Chief Inspector
Clouseau's residence.

19:47.146 --> 19:49.815
This is Chief Inspector Clouseau

19:50.023 --> 19:51.567
speaking on the phone.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.653
What? Oh, put him on.
Put him on.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.366
Good evening, Commissioner.

20:00.033 --> 20:00.784
How are you?

20:00.993 --> 20:03.620
How is Madame and all
the little commissioners?

20:12.254 --> 20:14.214
I see.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.553
Well, you can rest assured

20:19.761 --> 20:22.848
that I shall take every
precaution that is necessary.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.480
Thank you, Commissioner,
and good evening.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.737
I have just received word

20:36.945 --> 20:38.947
that former
Chief Inspector Dreyfus

20:39.156 --> 20:41.575
has escaped
from the insane asylum.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.785
For some reason,
the deputy commissioner

20:43.994 --> 20:46.413
thinks that he might try
to kill me.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.123
Obviously, the poor man
is crazier

20:48.332 --> 20:50.125
than anyone gives him
the credits for.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.586
Nevertheless, I am ordered
to take every precaution.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.088
Now, see that the back door
and the front door are locked

20:55.297 --> 20:58.800
while I slip into my new
hunchback disguise, Cato.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.391
Both doors are locked now.

21:47.599 --> 21:48.767
Who are you?

21:50.936 --> 21:53.647
What have you done
with Inspector Clouseau?

21:53.855 --> 21:55.816
Chief Inspector Clouseau.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.569
Fooled you, didn't I?

21:59.778 --> 22:03.865
Oh, Chief Inspector,
that is fantastic.

22:04.074 --> 22:06.118
If you think
this is fantastic

22:06.326 --> 22:08.578
wait till you see the
full effect with the hump.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.311
The bells! The bells!

22:32.519 --> 22:34.354
They deafen me!

22:42.738 --> 22:45.032
Chief Inspector Clouseau?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.746
Yes, this is
Chief Inspector Clouseau.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.497
Who is speaking?

22:52.706 --> 22:55.667
My name--
my name is Duval.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.005
Claude Duval.

23:00.714 --> 23:04.092
I have the honor
to be chairman

23:05.218 --> 23:08.347
of the Jacques Clouseau
presentation committee.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.475
The presentation committee?
For me?

23:13.393 --> 23:16.188
For what purpose, may I ask?

23:16.396 --> 23:17.898
For what purpose, you ask.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.401
How modest of you.

23:21.610 --> 23:25.072
The purpose, monsieur,
is to honor

23:25.280 --> 23:28.367
one of the city's
most dedicated,

23:28.575 --> 23:31.495
brave and selfless
public servants.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.414
You are most generous, monsieur.
Most.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.500
Yes, I must admit
I have often wondered,

23:36.708 --> 23:39.002
considering my years
on the force

23:39.211 --> 23:40.420
and my numerous accomplishments,

23:40.629 --> 23:43.507
why recognition was not
forthcoming earlier.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.967
Absolutely right.

23:46.176 --> 23:49.805
Nine years faithful service
at the Sûreté

23:50.013 --> 23:53.016
and not as much as a single
decoration in all that time.

23:54.393 --> 23:57.020
Yes, that is quite correct.

23:57.229 --> 23:59.815
However,
as you are no doubt aware

24:00.023 --> 24:03.777
I have recently received
an important promotion.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.362
Really?

24:05.570 --> 24:10.033
I have replaced the lunatic
Dreyfus as chief inspector.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.662
I know, and I'm sure Paris
sleeps the more safely

24:13.870 --> 24:15.288
because of the change.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.874
You're very most kind.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.501
But I can assure you
when it comes

24:19.709 --> 24:21.378
to matters of keeping the peace

24:21.711 --> 24:23.046
I'm always on my toes.

24:23.255 --> 24:24.589
Chief Inspector.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.216
One moment, please.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.386
Can't you see
that I'm on the phone?

25:03.545 --> 25:04.963
<i>Oh, yes, Commissioner.</i>

25:05.172 --> 25:07.424
<i>Fortunately, there was
sufficient air</i>

25:07.632 --> 25:08.842
still left in my hump

25:09.050 --> 25:11.344
to keep me afloat
until the rescue.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.554
Yes, yes.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.557
Well, thank you very much,
Commissioner. Good-bye.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.894
That was the commissioner.
He was most concerned.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.563
Well, you have been
very, very lucky, you know.

25:21.771 --> 25:22.689
Oh, yes, I know.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.525
Poor Cato will be in
the hospital for weeks.

25:25.734 --> 25:28.069
Do you know what kind
of a bomb it was?

25:28.278 --> 25:30.155
The exploding kind.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.783
Mark my words, Francois.
Sinister forces are at work.

25:33.992 --> 25:38.246
And this mad bomber must
be apprehended at all costs.

25:38.455 --> 25:41.124
Make sure you issue an
all-points bulletin immediately.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.752
- Yes, sir.
- What about my clothes?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.837
Oh, Sergeant Chauvin
is rounding some up for you.

25:46.046 --> 25:46.755
Hmm. Yes.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.548
While you're waiting,
perhaps you would sign the order

25:48.757 --> 25:50.675
to transport Jean Tournier
to prison.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.344
- Tournier the bank robber?
- Yes.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.721
I shall be happy
to sign that order.

25:54.930 --> 25:58.141
Ah, it's life for you
this time, Tournier.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.977
At last, we are rid of you.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.489
I have to go to the toilet.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.534
All right.

26:30.674 --> 26:31.925
Thank you.

26:51.736 --> 26:52.862
Tournier.

27:07.294 --> 27:09.170
All right, Tournier.
That's long enough.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.559
<i>Now this is my plan.</i>

27:22.767 --> 27:24.561
<i>Step number one:</i>

27:24.769 --> 27:28.273
<i>I will recruit the world's
greatest criminal minds.</i>

27:28.481 --> 27:29.482
<i>Step number two:</i>

27:30.400 --> 27:34.321
I will build an organization
so sinister, so, so powerful

27:34.529 --> 27:35.822
that by comparison,

27:36.031 --> 27:38.658
the Cosa Nostra will seem
like the Vienna Boys' Choir.

27:38.992 --> 27:40.160
Here is the list.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.163
But half of these men
are in prison.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.498
- We'll get them out.
- Impossible.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.960
I'll bet you 20 million francs
it isn't.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.712
Where would I get
20 million francs?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.213
I thought you'd ask that.

27:52.422 --> 27:56.384
Step number three: Next Thursday
at precisely 2:00 p.m.,

27:56.593 --> 27:57.886
you and six men will enter

27:58.094 --> 28:00.305
the main branch of
the Paris credit bank.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.475
<i>This afternoon, at
approximately</i>

28:03.683 --> 28:05.185
<i>five minutes to 5:00</i>

28:05.393 --> 28:08.313
<i>three men dressed in building
maintenance uniforms</i>

28:08.480 --> 28:10.899
<i>entered and robbed
the Paris credit bank.</i>

28:12.734 --> 28:15.695
<i>The leader has been identified
as Jean Tournier.</i>

28:16.112 --> 28:17.656
Hmmm

28:18.698 --> 28:21.701
Uh How much did they get?

28:21.910 --> 28:24.621
Millions. Here's the report.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.541
All right. That will be all,
Francois. Thank you.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.630
Twenty million francs.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.592
And now, the next step.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.241
<i>Hugo Fassbender and his
daughter have been kidnapped.</i>

29:43.450 --> 29:45.910
- Professor Fassbender?
- Yes. Paris has a theory.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.829
They're sending over
their top man,

29:48.037 --> 29:50.165
a Chief Inspector Clouseau.
He just sent this telegram.

29:50.373 --> 29:54.169
"Arrived Gatwick Airport,
B.R. 121, 12:38 p.m."

30:15.607 --> 30:17.442
Yes? Who are you?

30:17.650 --> 30:20.445
- Jarvis, sir.
- And what is it you do?

30:20.653 --> 30:23.531
- I am the butler.
- Ah, the butler. Yes, yes.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.118
Can you tell me where you were
on the night of the kidnapping?

30:27.327 --> 30:30.413
- Asleep in my room, sir.
- Asleep in your room.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.707
- Can you prove that?
- No.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.959
Make a note of that,
Sergeant Yard.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.462
Tell the staff to assemble
in the drawing room.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.756
I will interview them
in a few moments.

30:39.964 --> 30:40.965
Yes, sir.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.845
- What was your name again?
- Uh, Jarvis.

30:46.054 --> 30:46.971
Jarvis, that's right.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.974
Perhaps you'll be kind enough
to show me around the house.

30:50.183 --> 30:51.392
Very good, sir.

30:57.315 --> 31:00.026
I suggest we start
with the upstairs.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.863
- This is the upstairs, sir.
- Yes, I know that. I know that.

31:26.594 --> 31:27.971
This is a door.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.223
Uh, yes, sir, that is a door.

31:30.431 --> 31:33.476
- Yes, I know that. I know that.
- It's not locked, sir.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.146
Obviously.

31:38.815 --> 31:42.443
Stay where you are.
I prefer to handle this alone.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.626
<i>Is there anybody hiding there
in the dark?</i>

32:16.895 --> 32:20.815
Nothing like a good warm-up
when you're on a case, you know?

32:21.024 --> 32:25.904
Tell me, which switch did
you use to turn on the lights?

32:26.112 --> 32:27.989
The light switch, sir.

32:33.244 --> 32:35.163
Strange. It didn't work for me.

32:36.164 --> 32:37.457
Ah. Hmm.

32:38.875 --> 32:39.918
Yes.

32:40.835 --> 32:44.339
Unless I miss my guess, this
would be the, uh,

32:44.547 --> 32:46.507
gymnasium room, huh?

32:46.716 --> 32:49.761
- Great guess, sir.
- Yes. It is a good room.

32:50.970 --> 32:51.888
Yes.

32:58.353 --> 32:59.896
This reminds me
of my younger days

33:00.104 --> 33:01.898
at the Sûreté police academy.

33:02.857 --> 33:05.902
The parallel bars,
my speciality.

33:06.110 --> 33:09.072
I was something of an athlete,
you know. Yes, yes.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.660
I was known as the Pavlova
of the parallels.

33:13.868 --> 33:15.203
Oh, yes.

33:17.956 --> 33:20.667
Yes, it's all coming back now.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.961
Yes, I remember it--

33:32.595 --> 33:35.515
Well, that felt good!

33:36.933 --> 33:40.228
Well, now. I expect you're all
wondering why I asked you here.

34:16.431 --> 34:19.016
It's obvious that the knight
that wore that suit

34:19.225 --> 34:21.561
did not last very long.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.696
Yes, yes. I know, I know.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.697
Now, um...

34:33.906 --> 34:36.034
Yes. As I was saying, um...

34:36.242 --> 34:38.453
You were saying you
supposed we were all

34:38.661 --> 34:40.079
wondering why you called us.

34:40.288 --> 34:42.248
Look. There is no need
for you to speak

34:42.456 --> 34:44.542
unless I ask you a question.

34:44.876 --> 34:47.712
- What is your name?
- I'm Shork, the gardener.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.339
- And what is it you do?
- I'm the gardener.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.382
Why didn't you say that
to me in the first place?

34:52.592 --> 34:53.092
I did.

34:53.301 --> 34:55.511
Look, don't try to be
funny with me, monsieur.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.930
This is a very serious matter

34:58.139 --> 35:01.392
and everyone in this room
is under the suspicions.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.227
<i>- "Reum"?</i>
- What? What was that?

35:03.436 --> 35:05.521
- You said, "Reum."
- Yes, I know that.

35:05.730 --> 35:08.274
And there is a very good chance
that someone in this room

35:08.483 --> 35:11.778
knows more about the murder
than he is telling.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.738
- Murder?
- What was that you said?

35:13.946 --> 35:15.782
- I said murder.
- What murder?

35:15.990 --> 35:18.201
Well, I don't know.
You said murder.

35:18.409 --> 35:20.203
I said murder?
You said murder!

35:20.411 --> 35:23.081
No, I said murder
because you said murder!

35:23.289 --> 35:25.166
- I said murder?
- You said there was

35:25.374 --> 35:26.459
someone in this room

35:26.667 --> 35:30.379
who knew more about the murder
than he's telling.

35:30.546 --> 35:31.839
Now listen...

35:34.092 --> 35:35.593
- What was your name?
- Shork.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.928
- The cook.
- Gardener.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.014
Ah!
Now we are getting somewhere.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.391
You--

35:43.434 --> 35:44.769
Oh, dear!

35:44.977 --> 35:47.480
Are you all right,
Mr. Stutterstutt?

35:47.688 --> 35:49.816
- Who is this man?
- He's Mr. Stutterstutt.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.318
I see, and what is your job,
Mr. Stuckerstuff?

35:52.527 --> 35:53.820
He's the beekeeper.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.906
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.

35:57.115 --> 35:57.615
What's that?

35:57.824 --> 35:59.659
What is he saying to you?
What? What was that?

35:59.867 --> 36:01.077
He says he's got
a bit of a cold,

36:01.285 --> 36:02.829
and he's lost his voice.

36:03.037 --> 36:06.916
Lost his voice. A beekeeper
who has lost his voice

36:07.125 --> 36:09.252
a cook who thinks
he's a gardener

36:09.544 --> 36:11.838
and a witness to a murder.

36:12.046 --> 36:15.383
Oh, yes. It is obvious
to my trained eye

36:15.591 --> 36:18.261
that there is much more
going on here

36:18.469 --> 36:20.346
than meets the ear.

36:29.063 --> 36:32.024
Before you are dismissed,
Mr. Stiffsticker

36:32.233 --> 36:34.485
I suggest you count your bees.

36:34.694 --> 36:36.863
You may find that one of them
is missing.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.031
You ruined that piano!

36:39.240 --> 36:41.075
What is the price of one piano

36:41.284 --> 36:44.495
compared to the terrible crime
that has been committed here?

36:44.704 --> 36:46.831
But that's a priceless Steinway!

36:47.039 --> 36:50.042
Not anymore. What is your name?

36:50.251 --> 36:52.003
Mrs. Leverlilly.

36:52.211 --> 36:55.423
Mrs. Loveliver.
I would take a shrewd guess

36:55.631 --> 36:57.675
that you are the housekeeper,
am I right?

36:57.884 --> 37:01.554
I have been with Professor
Fassbender for 30 years.

37:01.762 --> 37:04.640
That would account
for your exaggerated hysteria

37:04.849 --> 37:06.642
over a simple blemish
on the furniture.

37:06.851 --> 37:08.102
Blemish!

37:08.311 --> 37:09.604
Whatever has happened
to the piano

37:09.812 --> 37:11.564
can easily be repaired.

37:11.898 --> 37:13.733
What has happened
to Professor Fassbender

37:13.900 --> 37:16.652
and his daughter
is another matter.

37:16.861 --> 37:20.239
And it is my job to bring
the guilty party, or parties,

37:20.448 --> 37:22.158
to their justice.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.368
<i>Now, then, what do we know?</i>

37:24.577 --> 37:27.830
One: That Professor Fassbender

37:28.039 --> 37:30.249
and his daughter
have been kidnapped.

37:30.666 --> 37:35.546
Two: That someone has
kidnapped them.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.592
Three: That my hand is on fire.

37:52.355 --> 37:53.731
Oh, Drummond, what's going on?

37:53.940 --> 37:56.150
Oh, uh, good afternoon, sir.

37:56.484 --> 38:00.196
Inspector Clouseau has been
interrogating the staff.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.491
Inspector Clouseau,
Superintendent Quinlan.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.243
Oh, Inspector.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.035
Superintendent.

38:30.518 --> 38:32.228
Why don't you just tell Potters
that he's incompetent

38:32.436 --> 38:34.146
and request that he be taken off
the case?

38:35.273 --> 38:39.819
Because we've got enough trouble
with France without suggesting

38:40.027 --> 38:43.364
that their greatest detec--
detective is a fool.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.743
Steady.

38:49.578 --> 38:50.705
Where is he now?

38:52.540 --> 38:55.001
He is shadowing
the Fassbender farm.

40:05.154 --> 40:06.822
Hello, sailor.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.743
- Yes?
- Who are you?

40:10.951 --> 40:12.787
Chuck. Who are you?

40:20.294 --> 40:21.587
What's that?

40:21.796 --> 40:24.548
I am Chief Inspector
Jacques Clouseau of the Sûreté.

40:24.757 --> 40:27.009
Oh,
how exciting.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.804
I think I will just
take a look around.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.056
Yes. Well, you'll have to
make use of the bar first

40:32.264 --> 40:33.015
or take a table.

40:33.224 --> 40:34.475
The show starts
in a couple of minutes.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.310
In that case,
I will take the table.

40:36.519 --> 40:38.396
Right. Follow me, Jock.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.065
- Jacques.
- Jack?

40:46.112 --> 40:48.489
Ladies and gentlemen, once again

40:48.697 --> 40:51.033
it is my profound pleasure
to introduce

40:51.242 --> 40:53.994
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis!

43:38.158 --> 43:39.326
Why is it that this afternoon

43:39.535 --> 43:42.204
you are Jarvis,
the Fassbender butler

43:42.413 --> 43:43.706
and tonight, you are

43:44.540 --> 43:46.417
Inspector, inspector,
before you get yourself all--

43:46.625 --> 43:48.877
Madame or monsieur,
I must warn you.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.171
You had better watch your step.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.889
- Something wrong, Ainsley?
- Of course not, Bruno.

44:01.140 --> 44:02.808
No, the inspector here
was just warning me

44:03.017 --> 44:04.184
that I had to watch my step.

44:04.560 --> 44:08.272
You see, back in France,
he's known as king of the tango.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.733
- Tango?
- Oh, I'd love to.

44:21.827 --> 44:24.246
- The kidnappers are here.
- Kidnappers?

44:30.961 --> 44:32.630
Okay. Let's go.

45:22.304 --> 45:24.139
You want to call Paris now?

45:33.691 --> 45:36.527
Look at it this way.
It can't possibly get any worse.

46:23.157 --> 46:26.535
Ah, Professor Fassbender!

46:28.829 --> 46:30.205
What an honor to have you

46:30.414 --> 46:33.542
and your charming daughter
as my guests.

46:33.751 --> 46:35.502
- Who the devil are you?
- Ah, yes.

46:35.711 --> 46:36.712
Who the devil, indeed.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.798
Come. Sit down.
Let us just say for the moment

46:40.007 --> 46:40.841
that I'm your host

46:41.049 --> 46:42.760
and that I will do
everything in my power

46:42.968 --> 46:44.762
to make your stay here
at Mondschien Castle

46:44.970 --> 46:46.513
as pleasant as possible.

46:46.722 --> 46:49.892
Providing, of course,
that you reciprocate

46:50.100 --> 46:53.020
by giving me something
that I very much want.

46:54.730 --> 46:56.231
And that would be?

46:56.982 --> 47:01.904
I am fascinated by your work
on time-space relationships

47:02.112 --> 47:06.700
particularly the vortices
of electromagnetic aberrations.

47:07.242 --> 47:07.993
I see.

47:08.869 --> 47:11.038
And do you work
for a particular government

47:11.246 --> 47:13.582
or do you expect to sell my
discovery to the highest bidder?

47:13.791 --> 47:17.377
Neither, Professor.
Nothing so mundane.

47:17.586 --> 47:20.714
You and I, we're going
to join forces, Professor.

47:21.131 --> 47:23.342
We're going to build
the Doomsday Machine

47:23.675 --> 47:24.843
and conquer the world.

47:25.052 --> 47:27.805
- Have a sweet.
- You're mad.

47:28.013 --> 47:31.141
Mad? On the contrary.

47:31.350 --> 47:33.894
Every day, in every way

47:34.102 --> 47:36.438
I've been getting better
and better.

47:37.397 --> 47:41.652
Mad? Was Hannibal mad?
Or Alexander?

47:41.860 --> 47:45.781
Surely Napoleon was the
maddest of them all. Mad?

47:47.032 --> 47:48.867
We shall see, Professor.

47:49.076 --> 47:52.621
- I shall tell you nothing.
- I think you will.

47:58.627 --> 48:00.295
<i>I'll die first.</i>

48:03.173 --> 48:05.551
Show Miss Fassbender
to the schoolroom.

48:07.302 --> 48:08.345
Daddy?

48:27.322 --> 48:28.657
What are you going to do?

48:28.866 --> 48:32.953
Something so very, very painful,
so hideous

48:33.161 --> 48:35.747
your father will have no choice
but to cooperate.

48:40.085 --> 48:40.794
No!

48:49.720 --> 48:53.307
All right. All right,
I'll tell you anything.

48:56.768 --> 48:57.769
<i>The Wolverines certainly have</i>

48:57.936 --> 48:59.187
<i>to put some points
on the scoreboard.</i>

48:59.396 --> 49:01.106
<i>I'm sure that Green
will come out throwing.</i>

49:01.315 --> 49:04.109
<i>He's got to get that ball
down deep into Navy territory.</i>

49:04.318 --> 49:06.904
<i>Green, now on third down,
looks to the left, throws it</i>

49:07.112 --> 49:09.239
All right, team! Let's go!

49:09.448 --> 49:10.574
<i>Throw's complete to Rhodes!</i>

49:10.782 --> 49:12.618
<i>He's inside the 50!
He's to the 20!</i>

49:12.826 --> 49:15.787
<i>The clock is running down.
Can the Wolverines do it?</i>

49:17.623 --> 49:20.500
- What happened?
<i>- Where's the game?</i>

49:20.709 --> 49:23.170
<i>- Who is that?
- Hello there.</i>

49:25.964 --> 49:28.884
- He's on every station.
- Well, call the F.C.C.

49:29.092 --> 49:31.303
Hold it! Hold it!
He's saying something.

49:31.511 --> 49:34.890
Mr. President,
everybody, calm down.

49:35.098 --> 49:37.392
Calm down, hell!
This is an emergen--

49:38.769 --> 49:40.854
An emergency.
Did Michigan score?

49:41.063 --> 49:43.857
Please, let's hear
what the fellow has to say.

49:44.066 --> 49:46.318
<i>It is little enough to ask</i>

49:46.526 --> 49:47.986
<i>the life of one man</i>

49:48.195 --> 49:50.489
<i>against a holocaust</i>

49:50.697 --> 49:52.783
<i>that could destroy the globe.</i>

49:53.909 --> 49:56.244
What the hell's
he talking about?

49:56.453 --> 49:57.996
Quiet.

49:58.205 --> 50:00.332
<i>That's why I say again</i>

50:00.540 --> 50:03.293
<i>give me Clouseau.</i>

50:04.753 --> 50:07.172
<i>And we can all sleep
secure in our beds.</i>

50:07.381 --> 50:08.423
What's a Clouseau?

50:08.632 --> 50:11.468
<i>And so, next week</i>

50:11.677 --> 50:12.844
<i>I shall give the world a--</i>

50:13.011 --> 50:16.515
<i>a demonstration
of the awesome power I hold.</i>

50:16.723 --> 50:19.101
<i>On Saturday, October 9th</i>

50:19.309 --> 50:23.105
<i>at precisely 3:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time</i>

50:23.313 --> 50:25.857
<i>the United Nations building</i>

50:27.526 --> 50:30.028
<i>will vanish
from the face of the earth.</i>

50:33.281 --> 50:35.117
<i>And the gun goes off.
The game is over.</i>

50:35.325 --> 50:38.286
Call the F.B.I., the C.I.A.
and the Pentagon.

50:38.495 --> 50:40.539
Find out who won the game!

50:45.002 --> 50:47.295
That's a photograph taken
by an American news photographer

50:47.504 --> 50:49.339
while the broadcast
was in progress.

50:50.716 --> 50:53.719
Paris has identified him
as one Charles Dreyfus

50:53.927 --> 50:56.805
former chief inspector
of the Sûreté.

50:57.931 --> 50:59.891
- You're joking.
- And more recently, an inmate

51:00.100 --> 51:03.729
at the state facility
for the criminally insane.

51:03.937 --> 51:06.815
Until he escaped.
Here's a text of his speech.

51:08.567 --> 51:10.402
He obviously controls equipment

51:10.610 --> 51:12.404
sophisticated enough
to pirate the satellite.

51:12.612 --> 51:13.655
"Give me Clouseau,

51:13.864 --> 51:15.490
and we can all
sleep secure in our beds."

51:15.699 --> 51:16.700
Thought that bit
might interest you.

51:16.908 --> 51:17.951
That's one crazy chief inspector

51:18.118 --> 51:19.661
talking about another
crazy chief inspector.

51:19.870 --> 51:22.622
What does he mean anyway?
"Give me Clouseau."

51:22.831 --> 51:26.251
Listen to this. "Little enough
to ask the life of one man

51:26.418 --> 51:28.795
against a holocaust
that could destroy the globe."

51:29.004 --> 51:30.797
You missed the best bit. Look.

51:31.006 --> 51:33.508
He also threatens to make
the U.N. building disappear.

51:37.763 --> 51:40.766
- Operation: <i>Looking Glass?</i>
- Fassbender.

51:40.974 --> 51:43.310
Give me--
Give me Lovell. Home Office.

51:44.061 --> 51:46.980
- Where's Clouseau?
- I've no idea.

51:59.993 --> 52:02.913
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
once again,

52:03.121 --> 52:06.833
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis.

52:24.643 --> 52:26.520
Monsieur Jarvis?

52:27.562 --> 52:28.772
Monsieur Jarvis?

52:58.051 --> 53:00.887
- Sir, the coroner's report.
- Ah, yes.

53:01.096 --> 53:03.390
It's amazing. Even after
he had been stabbed twice

53:03.598 --> 53:05.517
he was still able
to break the kidnapper's neck.

53:05.725 --> 53:09.646
- Ah, pity.
- Yes, he had a lovely voice.

53:11.439 --> 53:12.732
No, I meant pity that
the kidnapper's dead.

53:12.941 --> 53:14.943
We might have got
something out of him.

53:15.277 --> 53:17.112
I did get something out of him.

53:17.362 --> 53:18.071
What?

53:18.822 --> 53:20.699
What's that?

53:22.909 --> 53:25.370
- A clue.
- "Klew"?

53:25.579 --> 53:28.915
- What?
- You said a klew.

53:29.124 --> 53:31.918
Yes. A brochure clue

53:32.127 --> 53:34.796
advertising the Oktoberfest
in Munich.

53:35.005 --> 53:37.591
It begins the day
after tomorrow.

53:37.799 --> 53:39.885
And you think the dead man
was planning to go there,

53:40.093 --> 53:40.927
perhaps to meet someone?

53:41.136 --> 53:43.722
Yes. Perhaps to meet

53:44.598 --> 53:46.725
the lunatic Dreyfus.

53:48.518 --> 53:51.605
At one time, partners
in the war against crime

53:52.397 --> 53:55.358
now, arch-enemies.

54:00.155 --> 54:04.409
- You'll need help.
- I prefer to do this alone.

54:04.618 --> 54:06.453
Yes, but if Dreyfus is
what we suspect,

54:06.661 --> 54:08.371
he probably has an
army behind him.

54:08.580 --> 54:11.833
Of course it won't be easy,
but nothing worthwhile ever is.

54:12.042 --> 54:16.046
That is why I have always failed
where others have succeeded.

54:16.254 --> 54:21.426
For me, the greater the odds,
the greater the challenge.

54:21.593 --> 54:25.513
And, as always,
I accept the challenge.

54:25.722 --> 54:29.309
Well, I am off to Munich.

54:35.565 --> 54:39.444
Most ingenious.
The old closet ploy.

54:39.653 --> 54:42.906
I really must congratulate you.
If there's one thing I do enjoy

54:43.114 --> 54:45.325
it's a good closet ploy.

54:45.533 --> 54:48.912
Well, until we meet again
and the case is solved.

54:51.539 --> 54:53.458
The case is solved.

55:37.002 --> 55:39.087
Four minutes.

55:39.296 --> 55:41.506
We're gonna look like a bunch
of Dipsy Doodles

55:41.715 --> 55:43.842
if this turns out to be a hoax.

55:44.426 --> 55:45.302
Well

55:46.011 --> 55:46.928
we would look very foolish

55:47.137 --> 55:48.513
if we didn't take
every precaution

55:48.722 --> 55:50.515
and it turned out
not to be a hoax.

55:50.849 --> 55:52.684
Dr. Fassbender and
Operation Looking Glass

55:52.892 --> 55:54.686
are certainly no hoax,
Mr. Secretary.

55:55.020 --> 56:00.108
God. A weapon like that in the
hands of a crazy Frenchman.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.654
You are certain?
You can do it?

56:04.863 --> 56:05.613
Theoretically, yes.

56:05.822 --> 56:07.949
For your daughter's sake,
I sincerely hope so.

56:08.158 --> 56:09.951
Ah, the dreams I had.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.995
All the terrible things
I was going to do

56:12.203 --> 56:13.747
to that sweet child
if you failed.

56:13.955 --> 56:15.457
Look, I've done
everything you asked.

56:15.665 --> 56:18.585
Not yet.
When the U.N. building vanishes,

56:18.793 --> 56:21.046
then you will have done
everything I asked.

56:21.254 --> 56:24.758
What do you suppose
they will call the crater, huh?

56:24.966 --> 56:26.968
The Dreyfus Ditch!

56:27.177 --> 56:29.804
- There should be no crater.
- No crater?

56:30.013 --> 56:33.350
But I want a crater.
I want wreckage, twisted metal.

56:33.558 --> 56:35.643
Something the world
will not forget.

56:35.852 --> 56:39.105
- They will not forget today.
- They won't? Wonderful.

56:39.314 --> 56:40.815
I have to tinkle again. Don't
do anything till I get back.

56:41.024 --> 56:44.110
Too late. The countdown started.
One minute.

57:18.812 --> 57:20.313
Thirty seconds.

57:20.522 --> 57:22.857
Seven, six

57:23.733 --> 57:26.194
five, four

57:26.903 --> 57:31.116
three, two, one!

57:31.324 --> 57:32.700
Ignition!

57:49.008 --> 57:50.009
<i>Today,</i>

57:51.052 --> 57:52.137
<i>the U.N. building.</i>

57:54.097 --> 57:56.516
<i>Tomorrow, who knows?</i>

57:57.642 --> 58:00.019
<i>I think by now that the nations
of the world are aware of the</i>

58:00.228 --> 58:02.522
<i>the awesome power
which I control.</i>

58:02.730 --> 58:04.649
<i>A power so great, it--</i>

58:04.858 --> 58:08.570
<i>if I choose, I could--
I could wipe out an entire city.</i>

58:08.778 --> 58:10.905
<i>After all,
what is the life of a man</i>

58:11.114 --> 58:15.326
compared to the destruction
of a whole city?

58:16.494 --> 58:19.247
I give you seven days.

58:19.456 --> 58:21.541
Seven days.

58:21.749 --> 58:22.584
Okay.

58:24.794 --> 58:26.254
<i>Well done. Well done.</i>

58:27.088 --> 58:29.007
So, now we wait.

58:29.632 --> 58:31.968
All this to get one cop?

58:32.177 --> 58:35.096
But we have some of the finest
hit men here in Europe.

58:35.305 --> 58:36.055
In this very room.

58:36.264 --> 58:38.266
Yeah. Why don't we take
care of it ourselves, huh?

58:38.475 --> 58:39.934
Because you wouldn't
stand a chance.

58:40.143 --> 58:41.227
- Ah, sure.
- Aw, come on.

58:41.436 --> 58:44.647
- You don't know Clouseau.
- He can't be that good.

58:44.856 --> 58:47.066
Good? He's not good.

58:47.275 --> 58:50.069
He's terrible.
He's the worst.

58:50.862 --> 58:54.199
There is not any man like him
anywhere in the world.

58:54.407 --> 58:57.660
Compared to Clouseau,
this Doomsday Machine is--

58:57.869 --> 59:00.079
is just a water pistol.

59:00.288 --> 59:03.583
That's why it will take
all the great nations

59:04.918 --> 59:06.836
with all of their
trained assassins

59:07.921 --> 59:10.924
<i>and all of their
sophisticated murder weapons</i>

59:11.132 --> 59:12.759
<i>to eliminate Clouseau.</i>

59:20.183 --> 59:22.060
Taxi, please.

59:28.775 --> 59:29.901
This gentleman

59:30.693 --> 59:32.529
- What are you doing?
- That's my case.

59:35.907 --> 59:37.075
Lucky for you, I am in a hurry.

59:37.283 --> 59:39.118
Otherwise you would have
been arrested.

59:40.286 --> 59:43.456
<i>And when it comes to the matter
of eliminating Clouseau</i>

59:43.665 --> 59:47.502
nobody wants to have anybody
else get the credit for it.

59:47.710 --> 59:51.172
It's a matter of national pride.

59:51.381 --> 59:53.216
Well, I think we all agree,
don't we, Mr. President,

59:53.424 --> 59:55.802
that we simply cannot afford
to allow any other country

59:56.010 --> 59:58.179
to get hold of
Fassbender's machine.

59:58.388 --> 59:59.347
And crazy or not,

59:59.931 --> 01:00:01.391
anyone who has gone
to the lengths

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.686
that Dreyfus has gone to
in order to eliminate one man

01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:07.021
it's reasonable to assume

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.607
that Dreyfus will smile
very kindly

01:00:09.816 --> 01:00:12.694
on the one who eliminates
Inspector Clouseau.

01:00:12.902 --> 01:00:14.821
I think that's
pretty far-fetched.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:18.324
Mr. President,
if I told you one week ago

01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:20.577
that the U.N. building
would disappear

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:23.830
and that a certified lunatic
would blackmail the entire--

01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:26.165
You made your point.
What do we do?

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:29.627
Well, Mr. President,
Clouseau is in Munich.

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:32.046
Well, I ordered one of our
top people to Munich yesterday.

01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:34.924
- Yesterday?
- Well, just in case.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.968
He's just reported in.

01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:39.262
Clouseau has gone
to the Oktoberfest.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.432
I wonder if we have enough time
before the others act.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.603
Germany's already acted,
and bungled it.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:49.022
According to the latest
code transmission

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.774
twelve countries have got
their top assassins in Munich

01:00:51.983 --> 01:00:54.569
and they're all converging
on the Oktoberfest.

01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:59.157
My God, it will be
like a shooting gallery.

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.929
Try one of my pretzels.
They're good.

01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:48.785
What are you doing
to this poor, motherless child?

01:03:49.202 --> 01:03:50.453
You great big bully.

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:54.415
There, there, little boy.

01:05:15.371 --> 01:05:16.247
Sir.

01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:24.881
- I better call the President.
- You know what time it is?

01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:28.426
He wants me to call.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.597
Put me in, Coach.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.476
What's the score?

01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:47.361
Yes!

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.825
It's okay. How many?

01:05:53.034 --> 01:05:54.493
Twenty-six, Mr. President.

01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:57.997
Holy cow. No wonder Dreyfus
wants that Clouseau killed.

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.249
He's a one-man army.
Who's left?

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:03.252
Just the Russian
and the Egyptian.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.605
My key, please.

01:07:12.947 --> 01:07:14.824
127, please.

01:08:38.616 --> 01:08:41.410
Good evening,
Inspector Clouseau.

01:08:57.551 --> 01:08:58.551
I couldn't sleep,

01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:01.639
and I just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.608
I hope you don't mind.

01:09:27.915 --> 01:09:31.335
You Frenchmen are so romantic.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.005
<i>♪ Thank heaven ♪</i>

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:37.508
<i>♪ For little girls ♪</i>

01:10:48.913 --> 01:10:50.289
Swine maid.

01:12:47.239 --> 01:12:49.867
Oh, forgive me, darling.
I've just washed my hands.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:54.204
They must have been freezing.

01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:55.998
Freezing? Yes, yes.

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:57.791
Something wrong?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.378
Wrong? Oh, no, no.

01:13:01.587 --> 01:13:03.172
What could be wrong?

01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:09.595
Then come back to bed.

01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:11.597
Yes, yes, of course.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:13.891
Into the bed, you know.

01:13:15.059 --> 01:13:18.437
And take off
those so-silly pajamas.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:21.357
You may rest assured

01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:24.193
you will never see these
so-silly pajamas again.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.945
That I can assure you.

01:13:41.877 --> 01:13:43.087
<i>Darling?</i>

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:46.715
Yes, I won't be a moment, uh...

01:13:47.216 --> 01:13:48.592
darling.

01:13:50.302 --> 01:13:51.512
<i>Hurry, darling.</i>

01:13:53.514 --> 01:13:56.100
I'm just going to take a bath.

01:13:56.308 --> 01:13:57.226
<i>A bath?</i>

01:13:58.644 --> 01:13:59.978
Excuse me.

01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:03.524
Yes.

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:12.282
Hello, this is
Chief Inspector Clouseau.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:13.867
There is a beautiful woman
in my bed

01:14:14.076 --> 01:14:15.661
and a dead man in my bath.

01:14:24.545 --> 01:14:25.879
<i>If you're
going to take a bath,</i>

01:14:26.088 --> 01:14:27.631
<i>I want to take one with you.</i>

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:31.885
<i>Darling, it's freezing out here.
Let me in.</i>

01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:39.643
Madame,

01:14:39.852 --> 01:14:42.980
I arrest you for the murder
of the man in this bathtub.

01:14:43.188 --> 01:14:44.148
What?

01:14:44.356 --> 01:14:45.816
And I must warn you that--
a-- a--

01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:48.152
anything
you say will be taken down

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.572
and used in evidence against me.
You.

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:55.242
Who is he?

01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:57.453
I don't know.
He looks familiar.

01:14:59.455 --> 01:15:01.915
- He looks like you.
- Looks like me?

01:15:05.419 --> 01:15:07.254
Tournier, the bank robber.

01:15:07.463 --> 01:15:10.257
What is he doing in your bathtub
dressed up like you?

01:15:10.799 --> 01:15:13.594
It is a question
I could very easily ask you.

01:15:14.178 --> 01:15:16.054
But he has been shot

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:19.308
and I do not carry a gun.

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:21.727
Obviously not, no.

01:15:22.394 --> 01:15:24.521
I am Olga Bariosova.

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:27.941
Until one hour ago,
I was a loyal Russian agent

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:31.278
under direct order
from the presidium to kill you.

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.696
To kill me?

01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:35.199
I was considered
a perfect liquidator

01:15:35.407 --> 01:15:38.869
because no man had ever been
able to involve me emotionally

01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:40.954
until tonight.

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:45.042
Do you think that you
could fall in love

01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:49.546
with an ex-Russian agent?

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:52.257
Well, uh, of course,

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:55.093
everything is possible, yes.

01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:03.560
- But you are not the same.
- Huh?

01:16:04.019 --> 01:16:05.896
Oh, well, of course,

01:16:07.022 --> 01:16:09.233
dead men in bathtubs
have been known

01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:11.902
to make quite a difference,
you know.

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:16.156
Anyway, this is the man who can
lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus,

01:16:16.865 --> 01:16:18.492
who it is my sworn duty
to apprehend.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.703
I, too, had a sworn duty,
but I have forsaken it,

01:16:22.204 --> 01:16:25.958
become traitor,
given up everything for you.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:28.835
With me,

01:16:29.044 --> 01:16:32.172
it is the duty that comes first.

01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:35.884
Oh, make an exception
just this once.

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:38.303
I wish that I could.

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:41.473
You can. I guarantee it.

01:16:41.682 --> 01:16:44.309
No, you see, I--

01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:47.020
- Oh, look! Look!
- What?

01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.854
That tattoo.

01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:50.816
<i>When I arrested Tournier,
he did not have that tattoo.</i>

01:16:51.817 --> 01:16:54.361
It looks like the
Mondschien crest.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:55.404
Mondschien?

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:57.447
- Mm-hmm.
- What is that?

01:16:57.656 --> 01:17:01.285
An infamous family who ruled
Bavaria in the 15th century.

01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:06.331
I read somewhere
that the Mondschien Castle

01:17:06.915 --> 01:17:09.376
had recently been sold.

01:17:09.585 --> 01:17:11.545
You read somewhere that

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:14.089
they had sold the castle?

01:17:17.426 --> 01:17:20.887
Fancy them selling the castle,
just like that.

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:27.769
The castle!

01:17:27.978 --> 01:17:31.481
- Yes. Dreyfus.
- Dreyfus.

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.859
He is in the castle.

01:17:38.864 --> 01:17:39.823
<i>Merde.</i>

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:44.786
<i>Farewell. I am off
to Mondschien Castle.</i>

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:00.886
Must be getting a cavity.

01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:04.181
When can my daughter
and I leave?

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:07.434
When Clouseau is no more,
perhaps.

01:18:08.018 --> 01:18:09.811
I have done
everything you asked.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.731
You've done everything
I've asked so far

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:15.192
but I have not asked everything.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.111
What you mean is that you have
no intention of letting us go.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.322
You plan to continue
your reign of terror

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:22.491
whether Clouseau is eliminated
or not.

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:24.826
I must admit the thought
had occurred to me.

01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:25.994
You are mad.

01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:28.538
And you are redundant,
Professor.

01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:29.956
Redundant and fallacious.

01:18:30.165 --> 01:18:32.042
Madness does not
preclude achievement.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.419
You cannot operate the machine
without me.

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:36.588
Not yet,
but when you have taught me.

01:18:36.797 --> 01:18:38.799
And if I refuse to teach you?

01:18:39.007 --> 01:18:40.550
Then, regrettably,
I would have to take

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:43.345
the matter up
with your charming daughter.

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:46.431
- What kind of a man are you?
- A madman.

01:18:46.807 --> 01:18:50.602
- You said so yourself.
- Boss! Boss!

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:01.321
It's true.

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:02.072
When?

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.865
Early this morning,
in his hotel room.

01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:08.161
He's dead!

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:11.289
He's dead
in his hotel bedroom!

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:13.333
Hurray! I'm free!

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:17.879
Oh, I'm so happy, Professor.

01:19:18.088 --> 01:19:19.423
I'm so

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:39.901
<i>Guten tag.</i>

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:42.696
Good day.

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:45.365
My name is Professor Guy Gabroir

01:19:45.574 --> 01:19:48.577
medieval castle authority
from Marseilles.

01:19:49.327 --> 01:19:52.497
Tell me, do you have a room?

01:19:52.706 --> 01:19:56.376
I do not know
what a "reum" is.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.804
<i>Zimmer.</i>

01:20:08.013 --> 01:20:10.682
Ah! A room!

01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:13.101
That is what I have
been saying, you idiot.

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:14.644
Room.

01:20:15.103 --> 01:20:15.896
<i>Zimmer.</i>

01:20:32.037 --> 01:20:33.705
Does your dog bite?

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:36.625
No.

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:40.629
Nice doggy.

01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:46.426
I thought you said
your dog did not bite.

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.012
That is not my dog.

01:21:36.351 --> 01:21:38.103
Swine moat.

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:03.373
Anything I can get you, boss?

01:24:04.207 --> 01:24:07.252
I can't stand it any longer.
Get me a dentist!

01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:21.891
Yeah? Yeah.

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:23.810
No, no.

01:24:24.019 --> 01:24:28.231
Dr. Schultz lives here
but he has gone fishing.

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:29.274
Yeah.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:33.528
I don't know. Yeah.
I will tell him.

01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:38.825
Did I hear you say
a doctor lives here?

01:24:39.034 --> 01:24:41.703
He's a doctor and a dentist.

01:24:41.911 --> 01:24:44.080
He made mein teeth for me.

01:24:44.289 --> 01:24:46.374
They want him up at the castle.

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.253
Up at the castle?
Where can I find him?

01:24:50.462 --> 01:24:53.715
Hmm?
Dr. Schultz has gone fishing.

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:55.717
He probably won't
be back until--

01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:56.843
Show me his <i>zimmer.</i>

01:24:57.052 --> 01:24:58.261
- Hmm?
- His room!

01:25:13.193 --> 01:25:14.861
Hello!

01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:18.907
It's Dr. Schultz
from the village, you know.

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:45.850
Oh, excuse me, sir.

01:25:46.643 --> 01:25:48.853
- Dr. Schultz is here.
- Where?

01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:51.272
Ah, here, Doctor.
Please hurry.

01:25:51.481 --> 01:25:52.607
I am in agony.

01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:54.526
<i>Guten tag!</i>

01:25:56.861 --> 01:25:58.488
All will be well soon.

01:26:01.116 --> 01:26:03.368
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:06.204
The bone.
I can set it later.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:10.166
- Please hurry.
- First of all, I will need

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:12.335
some hot water and towels.

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:15.338
Get some hot water, Harry.
And lock the door.

01:26:15.547 --> 01:26:18.591
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- And lock the door, Harry.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.927
He does not wish
to be disturbed, you know.

01:26:21.136 --> 01:26:22.720
Please, Doctor, hurry.
I can't stand the pain.

01:26:22.929 --> 01:26:24.389
Yes, yes, yes.

01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:27.892
Yes. Now, then, let me see.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:29.185
- Ow.
- What?

01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:30.270
My eye.

01:26:30.478 --> 01:26:32.147
Your eye?
I thought it was your tooth.

01:26:32.814 --> 01:26:33.690
But it is my tooth!

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:35.775
I wish you would make
your mind up.

01:26:35.984 --> 01:26:37.569
I don't normally
make castle calls

01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.445
in the middle of the night,
you know.

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:45.618
Doctor.

01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:48.496
Wait while I...

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:52.917
<i>Yes, that's...</i>

01:26:57.589 --> 01:26:58.798
There it is.

01:27:00.884 --> 01:27:03.720
Now, open wide, please.

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:07.140
Now, let me see.

01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:10.894
Tell me when this hurts.

01:27:11.603 --> 01:27:13.438
- Is it that one?
- unh-unh.

01:27:14.856 --> 01:27:16.733
Is it that one?

01:27:17.275 --> 01:27:19.152
Ah, is it that one?

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.404
Ah, there is the naughty one.

01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:25.033
- Are you going to pull it?
- Pull it?

01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:27.577
Yes, of course I will pull it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:27:27.785 --> 01:27:30.246
Please give me something
to put me out.

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:31.748
Put you out?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.877
Yes. Here, first you must wear

01:27:36.085 --> 01:27:39.672
this special anesthetic
cotton wool, you know.

01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:41.007
Wear it over the eyes.

01:27:41.216 --> 01:27:44.677
On no account look out from
under the anesthetic cotton

01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:46.471
because that will ruin
the whole effect

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:48.223
of the anesthetic on the eyes.

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:49.599
You want me to
hold it like that?

01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:51.643
Hold it like that on the eyes

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:53.895
while I get some...

01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:56.648
Please hurry, Doctor.
I-- I can't stand the pain.

01:27:56.856 --> 01:27:58.691
Yes. Coming soon.

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:08.826
What are you doing?

01:28:09.035 --> 01:28:11.537
Just rearranging the furniture

01:28:11.746 --> 01:28:15.375
in order to give you the
full effect of the anesthetic.

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:19.045
Please, doctor, I'm in agony!

01:28:19.254 --> 01:28:21.422
Not for much longer.

01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:36.938
That was hell down there.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.147
What's wrong?

01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:43.778
Whoever built this house put
the stairs in the wrong place.

01:28:43.987 --> 01:28:46.447
Do you mean you-- you--
you fell down the stairs?

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:50.535
I was, uh, preoccupied
with the anesthetic, you know.

01:28:50.743 --> 01:28:53.788
It's really hot in here,
isn't it? Hot in here.

01:28:56.416 --> 01:28:58.376
Now, the, uh...

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.878
anesthetic.

01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:06.342
"Nitrous oxide."

01:29:08.886 --> 01:29:11.222
What's that?

01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:14.017
That is the--
the anesthetic, you know.

01:29:14.225 --> 01:29:15.560
Oh, good.

01:29:16.686 --> 01:29:19.355
Yes, it is good, yes. Yes.

01:29:21.482 --> 01:29:24.027
Please, Doctor.
The pain is getting worse.

01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:26.279
Please, hurry up.

01:29:26.487 --> 01:29:30.283
A few whiffs of this,
and you won't feel a thing.

01:29:31.326 --> 01:29:33.786
- All right.
- Now, breathe deeply.

01:29:36.289 --> 01:29:38.249
- How's that?
- It's fine.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:40.501
How do you feel?

01:29:43.004 --> 01:29:44.297
A little--
a little dizzy.

01:29:46.716 --> 01:29:49.177
- What's so funny?
- I don't know. Nothing.

01:29:49.385 --> 01:29:51.888
- Then why are you laughing?
- I don't know.

01:29:52.055 --> 01:29:55.975
- Why are you laughing?
- Because I-- I can't help it.

01:30:07.570 --> 01:30:08.988
Yes.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:13.701
<i>I love it.</i>

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:15.870
- Come on.
- It's gonna hurt.

01:30:16.079 --> 01:30:17.914
Good. Lovely.

01:30:34.138 --> 01:30:37.809
I will have to use
more leverage.

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.919
I don't know what you gave me,
Doctor

01:31:05.128 --> 01:31:07.588
but it's giving me
hallucinations.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.758
Your whole--
your whole face has changed.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.427
It has?

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:26.691
How's this?

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:28.359
Grotesque!

01:31:30.903 --> 01:31:33.239
Boss!

01:31:33.448 --> 01:31:36.033
We just got word, boss.
Clouseau is still alive.

01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.830
I knew it!

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.045
He--
he has pulled the wrong tooth!

01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:53.176
There's only one man
who would pull the wrong tooth.

01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:57.054
It's Clouseau!

01:31:57.221 --> 01:31:59.640
Kill him!

01:31:59.849 --> 01:32:01.601
<i>Kill him!</i>

01:32:24.123 --> 01:32:27.627
Get Fassbender and his daughter
into the control room.

01:32:27.835 --> 01:32:29.754
What about Clouseau?

01:32:29.962 --> 01:32:34.258
Priorities.
First I will pick a target.

01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:36.344
Then Clouseau.

01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:57.657
Now we'll see
who has the last laugh.

01:32:57.865 --> 01:32:59.951
They've all betrayed me,
and now they will have to pay.

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:02.954
What shall I destroy?
Buckingham Palace? Too small.

01:33:03.162 --> 01:33:04.956
How about London?
Not big enough.

01:33:05.164 --> 01:33:07.583
England! Yes, England.

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:09.585

01:33:09.794 --> 01:33:12.338

<i>Within five minutes,
I shall destroy England.</i>

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.853
<i>England!</i>

01:33:28.062 --> 01:33:30.398
<i>No more cricket.</i>

01:33:30.606 --> 01:33:33.317

<i>No more fish and chips.

01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:46.581
England!

01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:45.598
Do something.

01:34:45.806 --> 01:34:48.351
You brought it on yourself.
It's too late.

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:49.852
<i>Wait!</i>

01:34:50.061 --> 01:34:52.897
<i>Do something!
Come-- come back! Help me!</i>

01:34:53.105 --> 01:34:54.440
Look!

01:34:56.442 --> 01:34:57.943
You've gotta help me.

01:34:58.152 --> 01:35:01.238
<i>Help, Professor! Help!</i>

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.671
Cato, my little yellow friend,
I'm home.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.631

01:36:57.688 --> 01:36:59.023
<i>Cato?</i>

01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:22.379
I gave Cato the night off.

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:27.343

Darling!

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.500
Where did you go?

01:40:47.001 --> 01:40:49.712
- Your voice?
- Yes, that was my voice.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.506
That was my voice singing a--
a little song we used to sing

01:40:52.715 --> 01:40:55.759
in the Resistance
to keep up the courage.

01:40:55.968 --> 01:40:58.804
Was it hard for you
in the Resistance?

01:40:59.013 --> 01:41:02.725
Very hard, but not as hard
as it is now.

01:41:02.933 --> 01:41:04.727
<i>Darling, relax.</i>

01:41:04.935 --> 01:41:07.354
<i>Resistance is over.</i>

01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:10.190
<i>My darling.</i>

01:41:11.358 --> 01:41:13.402
My beautiful darling.

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:15.696
What?

01:41:15.904 --> 01:41:19.033
Cato! You imbecile,
not now, Cato!
