WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.119
No. I actually...

00:04.170 --> 00:05.523
(laughs)

00:05.570 --> 00:07.697
No, it's not a good idea.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.539
MAN:
Yes. Why are you laughing?

00:11.570 --> 00:13.106
It's legal now.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.573
(Alicia laughs)

00:14.610 --> 00:16.601
Because, Jacob,
there is a fine line

00:16.650 --> 00:19.744
behNeenlegalandiHegal
in this business.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.111
Why don't you just
start a nursery?

00:21.150 --> 00:22.549
I have a business partner

00:22.590 --> 00:24.114
who thinks that this is
the better way to go.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.412
Let me study up
on the regulations,

00:25.450 --> 00:27.759
and I'll call you back.
Jacob, go slow on this.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.280
Daddy!
Okay, thanks.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.753
All done.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.156
Wow. Catering.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.124
This must be serious.
(Eli and Peter laugh)

00:38.170 --> 00:40.138
Just, uh, trying to be
respectful of your time.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.058
(clears throat)

00:42.110 --> 00:43.509
So, what's new?

00:43.540 --> 00:46.805
I've been asked
to run for president.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.808
(laughs)

00:48.840 --> 00:52.071
Not the response
I expected, but okay.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.769
By whom?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.617
The Illinois
Democratic Committee.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.345
Why?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.812
Are you kidding?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.408
No. I mean, the race is

01:00.460 --> 01:02.087
already happening,
isn't it? You're late.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.654
Not to announce. _
I'm not running to wm.

01:03.690 --> 01:05.726
I'm running
to be vice president.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.399
ELI: The party analyzed the race
and decided that the current

01:08.430 --> 01:10.523
frontrunners wouldn't accept
each other as vice president,

01:10.570 --> 01:14.097
so that meant there's room
for an outSIder.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.101
What do you think?

01:19.140 --> 01:21.438
(phone ringing)
Oh, sorry. I have to get that.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.117
Hello.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.558
Yikes.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.126
(phone chimes)

01:42.600 --> 01:44.227
JACOB: Yeah, can I help you?
Whoa, whoa.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.862
MAN:
Let go of the window.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.891
JACOB: Get your hands off me,
man. No, take your hands off!

01:47.940 --> 01:50.238
MAN 2: You want a bullet in
your head? Let go of the wmdow!

01:50.270 --> 01:52.170
JACOB: No, no! Wait a minute...
MAN: He's got his cell phone on.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.575
JACOB:
I don't have any cash!

01:53.610 --> 01:55.134
MAN: And it's recording.
Check his pocket.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.398
JACOB:
Alicia! Alicia, help me, help...

02:00.180 --> 02:02.546
Hi. This is Jacob Rickter.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.239
Please leave a message
at the beep.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.281
(beep)

02:07.590 --> 02:09.729
PETER:
Alicia, we have to head out.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.255
Sorry. A client.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.256
Okay, listen,

02:15.300 --> 02:18.167
I'm not running unless you
and the kids agree to it.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.690
Peter, I reacted too fast.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.459
Congratulations. I know this is
what you've always wanted.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.603
It is pretty
amazing. Thank you.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.838
(door opens)

02:27.880 --> 02:29.245
(mouthing)

02:29.280 --> 02:32.545
(door closes)

02:34.380 --> 02:35.347
(phone beeps on)

02:35.380 --> 02:37.245
(dialing)

02:37.290 --> 02:41.249
(phone ringing)

02:41.290 --> 02:42.484
Hello.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.919
Nicole, hi.
I'm Jacob's lawyer.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.292
I was just talking to Jacob.
Is he still there?

02:47.330 --> 02:49.525
No, he went out
to meet with Greg.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.219
Want me to have him call?
(doorbell rings)

02:51.270 --> 02:52.669
Oh, uh, is Greg his partner?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.258
Yes. Why?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.858
Do you know
where they were meeting?

02:55.900 --> 02:58.334
No, I don't.
What's wrong, Alicia?

02:58.370 --> 02:59.906
Nothing. It's probably nothing,

02:59.940 --> 03:02.306
but I need
to get a hold of Jacob.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.476
Can you try Greg for me?

03:03.510 --> 03:04.909
Sure. Hold on.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.815
Mrs. Florrick. Hi.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.284
It's me.
Mr. Lester?

03:09.320 --> 03:10.947
I thought I'd
just drop by.

03:10.990 --> 03:14.517
My wife says I'm not
spontaneous enough, so...

03:14.560 --> 03:17.222
Actually, Mr. Lester,
I'm a bit busy.
Yes, me, too.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.990
May I come in?
Actually, I'm in the midst,
Mr. Lester.

03:20.030 --> 03:23.329
Do you need the phone number
for Mr. Bishop's new lawyers?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.964
You know Mr. Bishop's
in jail awaiting trial?
Yes, I did.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.333
But, again,
I'm not his...
Can I have a
glass of water?

03:29.370 --> 03:32.771
It's just so hot outside.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.802
Sure.

03:40.650 --> 03:44.814
So, um, how is your
friend, uh, Kalinda?

03:44.850 --> 03:47.978
How? I don't know.

03:48.020 --> 03:51.387
Mr. Bishop is very interested
in her whereabouts.

03:51.430 --> 03:54.297
Do you happen to have any
idea where that might be?

03:54.330 --> 03:55.991
No.

03:56.030 --> 03:58.863
Oh, you didn't need to
bring me the whole bottle.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.630
I always think these
things are such a waste,

04:01.670 --> 04:04.434
just ending up in a
landfill somewhere.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.370
I recycle.

04:06.410 --> 04:08.605
So, Kalinda's gone from her
apartment, her cell phone's off.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.779
No one seems to
know where she IS.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.779
And yet in court
two days ago,

04:13.820 --> 04:17.347
you said Kalinda talked
to you about your case.

04:17.390 --> 04:21.952
So that makes you the last
person to talk to her.

04:21.990 --> 04:25.050
So, did she happen to
leave you anything, Alicia?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.626
A note or anything?

04:26.660 --> 04:28.355
No.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.560
Really?

04:29.600 --> 04:32.467
A good friend
like you?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.991
It would make
things so much

04:35.040 --> 04:37.668
less complicated for
you if you helped me.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.929
For you and your family.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.302
Do you know who was
just here, Mr. Lester?

04:44.350 --> 04:46.079
KaHnda?
No.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.078
My husband, the governor.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.917
Maybe you've heard of him.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.838
He was here
with his two bodyguards.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.313
Two more downstairs
and two in his SUV.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.487
You may have seen them
when you arrived?

04:56.530 --> 04:58.088
They gave me a panic button
in the kitchen,

04:58.130 --> 05:00.849
and when I went _
to get your water, I pushed It.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.391
So if I were you,
I would take

05:03.430 --> 05:05.591
your little bottle
of water and go.

05:05.630 --> 05:08.360
And tell Mr. Bishop
I no longer work for him.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.402
NICOLE:
Okay, I got hold of Greg.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.908
Oh, Nicole,
hold on one second.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.908
I need to take this, Mr. Lester.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.408
If you could take five steps
back so I can close the door.

05:17.450 --> 05:21.443
Next time you talk to Kalinda,
tell her I need to speak to her.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.744
Good-bye, Mr. Lester.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.458
Sorry, Nicole.
What did he say?

05:30.490 --> 05:32.390
Well, he said
that Jacob never showed up.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.421
What's going on?
What did you hear?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.519
I-I don't know,

05:36.570 --> 05:40.791
but it sounded like
Jacob had turned on his phone

05:40.840 --> 05:44.799
so I could hear him being
accosted by... two men.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.432
What two men?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.937
I don't know.
Look, it might not be anything.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.916
He had money, Alicia,
uh, for his business.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.440
Let me call the police.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.880
Why did he call you?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.444
What?

05:58.490 --> 06:00.458
Why you, Alicia?
Why not me?

06:00.490 --> 06:02.014
Nicole, hold on for a second.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.721
What?!

06:03.760 --> 06:06.149
Wait. Uh, what are you doing?
ALICIA:
I have an idea.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.522
There's a chance he called me
because he was being arrested.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.959
I think what I heard

06:10.000 --> 06:10.967
was an arrest.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.069
Okay, call me back, Alicia.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.397
I will. Don't worry.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.431
(phone beeps off)

06:18.710 --> 06:20.530
(line ringing)

06:20.580 --> 06:22.502
MAN:
29th District Booking.
How may I direct your call?

06:23.910 --> 06:25.673
My client was arrested
a half hour ago,

06:25.710 --> 06:28.577
and I need you to check the
arrest queue for his CB number.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.019
Client's name?

06:30.050 --> 06:31.415
Jacob Rickter.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.850
Hold, please.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.088
(phone beeps on)

06:38.130 --> 06:40.121
(dialing)

06:41.860 --> 06:44.090
Cary, hi. Do you have a minute?

06:44.130 --> 06:45.893
Yeah. Wait. Hold on, Alicia.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.192
Completely ridiculous.
You're being so obtuse...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.867
What is it?

06:48.900 --> 06:50.868
Do you have any way of getting
in touch with Kalinda?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.468
No. Why?

06:52.510 --> 06:53.670
Charles Lester was here.

06:53.710 --> 06:56.543
VVhen?

06:56.580 --> 06:57.877
A minute ago.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.446
Are you all right?

06:59.480 --> 07:01.675
Yes.
CARY:
What did he want?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.439
He wanted to talk to Kalinda,
find out where she was.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.549
Cary, do you have
an opinion on this?
It's not about

07:06.590 --> 07:08.148
opinions, Diane.
Of cours_e_it's
about opinions.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.919
It's about opinions,
it's about beliefs.
No, no.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.985
It's the smart move.
It's not...

07:12.030 --> 07:14.021
You're always
talking about smart...

07:14.060 --> 07:15.789
What?

07:15.830 --> 07:17.718
David?

07:21.540 --> 07:22.962
David, what?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.001
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

07:41.860 --> 07:44.488
Simone?

07:44.530 --> 07:45.849
Yes.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.824
Oh. Hi.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.521
Hi. (laughs)

07:49.570 --> 07:51.561
You're the new paralegal?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.693
Yes. Oh, did you need anything?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.696
Oh, sure.

07:57.570 --> 08:00.505
Did you know Louis Canning's
wife works here?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.644
What?
What?

08:02.680 --> 08:05.069
He still hasn't called.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.771
And Central Booking says
he wasn't arrested.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.618
Oh, my God. Alicia...

08:09.650 --> 08:10.981
(sighs)

08:11.020 --> 08:13.511
Do you have
your cell phone?

08:13.560 --> 08:14.709
ALICIA:
Did Jacob set this up?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.284
Yes. Why?

08:16.320 --> 08:19.721
There's this app on both your
iPhones if he set it up. Good.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.059
Find a phone.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.169
What's that?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.668
It's the last location

08:26.700 --> 08:28.691
of Jacob's phone.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.830
(wind whistling)

08:41.320 --> 08:43.788
(distant rhythmic beeping)

09:12.820 --> 09:14.811
(siren wailing in distance)

09:32.400 --> 09:34.664
(lights buzzing)

09:49.820 --> 09:51.617
My client is here.
Jacob Rickter.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.083
May I see him, please?

09:53.120 --> 09:56.180
Right, he was just signed
in two hours ago. Hold on.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.259
(clears throat)

10:08.300 --> 10:09.665
Hello, ma'am.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.632
I was wrong.
He's not here.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.638
Uh... I'm sorry. What?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.807
The man you asked about--

10:15.840 --> 10:18.968
he's not here.
But you just said he was.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.649
Yeah. Yes, uh,
I made a mistake.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.989
You... May I look
at your database?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.385
MAN 2:
No.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.183
He's not here.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.108
How-how can you make
that kind of mistake?

10:29.160 --> 10:31.685
I mean, he's either here
or he's not.

10:31.730 --> 10:34.255
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.
It's against the law

10:34.300 --> 10:36.928
to hold him without access to
his lawyer, and I'm his lawyer.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.699
Mike, I need your
help out here!

10:38.730 --> 10:40.664
Please, ma'am.
Hey.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.134
What? My client has a
constitutional guarantee...

10:43.170 --> 10:46.139
Do you have an automobile
near here, ma'am?

10:46.170 --> 10:48.707
You can let go. I'm fine.
Okay, we're gonna need
you to drive away, ma'am.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.777
Or what? _
Or you'll be Interfering
in police matters.

10:51.810 --> 10:55.018
You have a nice day, ma'am.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.937
(clicking)

11:23.480 --> 11:27.177
Yeah, it's
Homan Square.
Excuse me?

11:27.220 --> 11:30.189
Homan Square. It houses the bomb
squad and the undercover cops

11:30.220 --> 11:32.438
and... the police sometimes

11:32.490 --> 11:35.288
hold suspects there, too.
Yeah, but they can't...
They... They wouldn't

11:35.320 --> 11:37.982
let me in to see my client.
Yeah, but your client's
not under arrest yet.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.227
So the police have taken him,
but he wasn't arrested?

11:41.260 --> 11:44.320
Yup.
Because if he was arrested,
I would be allowed to see him?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.190
Right.
Oh, my God, this is insane.

11:46.230 --> 11:47.936
You need to_file a habeas
petition right away.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.938
The police mostly take
people to Homan Square

11:49.970 --> 11:52.063
that nobody cares about,
so you start caring...

11:52.110 --> 11:53.509
they'll release him.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.202
Got it. Wow.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.947
Oh, Alicia.
I've thought about it.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.072
What?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.439
You and me.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.811
Uh, starting a firm.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.112
Oh, right.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.082
We-We should do it.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.111
Oh, my God.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.084
Sorry. I thought you were
gonna say no. And I...

12:10.130 --> 12:12.257
Wow, I've been apologizing
a lot lately. I need to stop

12:12.290 --> 12:15.225
doing that. That... This
is great news. Partner.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.797
Okay. So, we're off.
Right.

12:17.830 --> 12:20.230
Our first client.
Jacob Rickter.
Jacob Rickter.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.261
JUDGE MORRIS: We have
a habeas matter, I believe,

12:22.300 --> 12:24.029
but we also have
the matter of lunch.

12:24.070 --> 12:27.176
The people are willing to delay
until after lunch, Your Honor.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.472
Unfortunately, this is
time-sensitive, Your Honor.

12:28.510 --> 12:30.307
We have a client
being held by police

12:30.350 --> 12:31.806
and we need access to him.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.147
He's not being held.
Okay,

12:33.180 --> 12:35.944
okay. Can this be argued
in less than five minutes?

12:35.980 --> 12:37.288
BOTH: Yes, Your Honor.
No, Your Honor.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.788
Well, let's live dangerously
and try.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.811
JACOB: Take your hands off!
MAN 2:
You want a bullet in your head?

12:41.860 --> 12:43.782
Let go of the window!
JACOB: No, no! Wait a minute...

12:43.830 --> 12:45.525
MAN: He's got his cell phone on.
JACOB: I don't have any cash!

12:45.560 --> 12:47.289
MAN:
And it's recording.
Check his pocket.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.297
JACOB:
Alicia! Alicia, help me,
help me, plea...

12:48.330 --> 12:50.423
That's an arrest, Your Honor.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.836
I don't know what that it is,
but there is no foundation

12:52.870 --> 12:56.237
for any part of that.
Mr. Brody, it's a simple matter,
as habeas petitions go.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.828
Why can't you
produce Mr. Rickter?

12:57.870 --> 12:59.531
Very simply, Your Honor,
we don't have him.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.277
As was explained to Mrs.
Florrick on numerous occasions,

13:02.310 --> 13:04.369
her client is not
in the CB database.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.503
We have not arrested him.
He's being held in Homan Square.

13:06.550 --> 13:10.145
Do you know that
for a fact, Counselor?
We have his wife's

13:10.190 --> 13:12.283
cell phone showing us
that his fuel! is there.
0,

13:12.320 --> 13:13.810
it was just
turned off there.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.213
It's not determinative.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.887
Anyway, when
I hear that call,

13:16.930 --> 13:18.818
it doesn't sound like
the police. It sounds like

13:18.860 --> 13:20.259
a person being accosted.
He's right,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.256
Counselors.
Call the police

13:22.300 --> 13:24.894
or bring me stronger
evidence of an arrest.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.262
Otherwise, I don't know
what to do. Lunch.
(gavelbangs)

13:27.300 --> 13:29.188
DIANE:
HI.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.266
I'm Diane Lockhart.
Yes. I know. Uh,

13:32.310 --> 13:34.369
do you need something?
No, no.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.401
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.101
You're Simone...

13:38.150 --> 13:39.845
Raushenbush.
Ah, that's your

13:39.880 --> 13:41.279
maiden name?
Yes.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.571
Is that a problem?
No.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.315
I just think we
know your husband.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.386
Yes, you do.
Louis Canning.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.980
I used my maiden name
in the interview

13:49.020 --> 13:50.624
because I wanted
to get this job on my own.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.150
Is that all right?

13:52.190 --> 13:53.327
Yes.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.191
Uh, just to be clear,

13:55.230 --> 13:56.959
we're often in competition
with your husband.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.298
Oh, I know.
I am completely discreet.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.890
Completely.
You can totally trust me.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.868
Nice to meet you.
You as well.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.231
RECEPTIONIST: Lockhart,
Agos & Lee. Please hold.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.941
Ms. Lockhart.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.538
Hello, how are you?
Mr. Lester.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.241
You know, it seems
that every time

14:13.280 --> 14:14.372
I come up here, this place

14:14.420 --> 14:16.069
has a new name.
Well, we like

14:16.120 --> 14:17.246
to keep you on your toes.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.259
In fact, it's, uh,

14:27.300 --> 14:29.393
actually Mr. Bishop's
intention

14:29.430 --> 14:31.295
to only pursue
legitimate work

14:31.330 --> 14:34.265
from now on.
Cary, hello.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.267
Mr. Lester.
Lemond Bishop

14:35.300 --> 14:38.269
is thinking of bringing
his business back here.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.232
Really? I thought
he was in jail.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.907
He is, yes. Uh,

14:41.940 --> 14:43.339
thus the disappointment

14:43.380 --> 14:46.543
in his current representation.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.946
So, uh, where's that

14:48.980 --> 14:50.413
great little investigator

14:50.450 --> 14:52.384
you have
around here?
Kalinda doesn't work here

14:52.420 --> 14:54.308
anymore.
Where does she work?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.452
We don't know.
She left.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.119
Well, let me, uh,

15:02.160 --> 15:04.469
leave you my number.
DIANE: Certainly.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.537
Oh, and if, uh, Kalinda gets
in touch with you, you can

15:07.570 --> 15:09.060
reach me
at this number,

15:09.100 --> 15:11.330
day or night.
Talk to you soon.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.542
He's after Kalinda?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.047
Yes.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.521
(computer dings)

15:48.280 --> 15:52.102
What's going on?
Are we in trouble?
Are we movmg?

15:52.150 --> 15:54.368
No, your mom and I just wanted
to run something by you.
ALICIA: It's not over yet,

15:54.420 --> 15:56.718
Nicole. We have
a sympathetic judge

15:56.750 --> 15:58.513
and we have new evidence.

15:58.550 --> 16:01.713
I have to go.
Uh, I'll talk to you.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.580
Sorry.
Court ran late.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.088
Did you, uh,
have the talk already?

16:07.130 --> 16:09.496
No, we just started.
Wait, started what?

16:09.530 --> 16:11.669
Okay, so...

16:11.700 --> 16:13.463
the Democratic Committee...
(cell phone rings)

16:14.470 --> 16:16.495
(phone beeps off)
Sorry.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.998
The Democratic Committee has
asked me to run for president.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.679
(laughs)
You're kidding.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.473
That's great.
VVhen?

16:24.510 --> 16:26.171
Uh, well,
I'd have to start

16:26.210 --> 16:28.144
making trips
to Iowa next week.
The White House,

16:28.180 --> 16:30.284
wow. I'll be
one Metro stop

16:30.320 --> 16:32.117
away.
Actually, it's not to win.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.118
The logic is, I would
run to make myself

16:34.160 --> 16:36.048
a viable candidate
for Vice pre5ident.

16:36.090 --> 16:39.184
Cool. That's
still cool.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.357
Grace?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.163
Well, would you
run together?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.464
What do you mean?
You and Mom--

16:45.500 --> 16:48.037
would you go
to Iowa together?

16:48.070 --> 16:50.630
Well, I don't know
if I'll have the time.

16:50.670 --> 16:54.709
Well, maybe... maybe
a few times, hopefully.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.674
Look, nothing's been decided.

16:56.710 --> 16:59.247
I'm not gonna run
unless we all agree.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.441
This is going to be
a family consensus.
Are you

17:01.480 --> 17:03.084
still gonna pretend
you're married?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.382
We don't

17:04.420 --> 17:05.614
have to pretend--
we are married.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.459
You're living in your
apartment, Dad.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.048
And Mom's here.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.682
Well, that's because
I have to be in Springﬁeld.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.597
Yes. We'd still
have to pretend.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.689
Peter.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.721
Close the door, okay?

17:24.110 --> 17:26.101
Are we gonna be angry
with each other?

17:26.140 --> 17:27.402
No.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.147
Peter...

17:30.180 --> 17:31.772
you already decided.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.711
Don't put it on us.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.446
Put what?
I haven't decided.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.482
Look”.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.511
Grace will approve your decision

17:42.560 --> 17:44.482
because she knows
you want to run,

17:44.530 --> 17:46.748
and she doesn't want
to stand in your way.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.465
And then they'll
rip us to shreds,

17:50.500 --> 17:51.819
because that's
what the press does.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.338
They'll look
into our lives,

17:54.370 --> 17:57.362
our families,
our children,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.264
and Grace will blame herself.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.834
It's not her decision.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.632
You know it's not her decision.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.739
It's yours and Eli's.

18:04.780 --> 18:05.701
You don't think
I can walk away from this?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.479
I don't think you can
walk away from this.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.839
Then you don't know me.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.848
Okay.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.589
I don't approve.

18:14.620 --> 18:17.453
If it's up
to your family,

18:17.490 --> 18:19.856
I don't want you
to run for president.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.327
Okay.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.475
(exhales)

18:46.890 --> 18:48.152
(door opens)

18:49.760 --> 18:51.887
Officer, hello.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.319
You know Jacob Rickter
is in that building, sir.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.294
Why don't you just
leave me alone, please?

18:56.330 --> 18:58.628
His family
is going crazy.

18:58.670 --> 19:02.629
They're worried he's dead
or kidnapped.

19:02.670 --> 19:05.309
I don't think you realize
how bad this is.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.399
Jacob Rickter
is epileptic.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.533
He's been 12 hours
without his medication.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.740
In another four hours
he could be dead.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.873
You're lying.
And if he dies,

19:12.910 --> 19:15.310
Officer Tannerman,
everybody in that building

19:15.350 --> 19:17.614
has deniability except you.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.288
You're the only
one I've told.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.709
And I will sue you for
everything you have.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.852
You're lying.

19:22.890 --> 19:25.779
You have any doubts,
call his doctor.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.798
Go ahead,
call him.

19:27.830 --> 19:28.899
He'll tell you.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.765
* _Feel_like swimmin' in
the river in the darkness... *

19:37.810 --> 19:41.803
ALICIA:
How long do you think
we should give it?

19:41.840 --> 19:42.875
POLMAR:
Another hour.

19:42.910 --> 19:44.901
*

19:46.410 --> 19:48.549
Alicia, can I be
up front with you?

19:48.580 --> 19:49.569
Have you not been?

19:49.620 --> 19:53.556
No, I have been, but, um...

19:53.590 --> 19:55.956
this girl that I'm seeing

19:55.990 --> 19:58.458
is my ex-wife.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.922
We're making
another go at it.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.599
That's great. Good.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.791
Yeah, it is great.
It is great.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.264
I don't like
failing at things.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.201
And I-I feel like
I failed at it, so...

20:13.480 --> 20:15.300
No, it's fantastic.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.978
So it's not gonna get in the way
of us working together?

20:17.010 --> 20:19.774
What? No, no. No.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.448
Good.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.710
Because I want
it to work.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.446
(phone ringing)

20:26.490 --> 20:27.809
(music shuts off)

20:29.820 --> 20:31.287
Hello.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.459
You want to talk to me about
my patient, Jacob Rickter?

20:39.500 --> 20:42.469
Oh, nothing yet, sir.
But I'm just getting started.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.435
Nah, only ifI need help.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.928
Do you know how many
frozen pizza choices there are?

20:48.980 --> 20:51.574
It's like a nightmare of pizzas.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.340
Yes, uh... yes, sir.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.486
I'll call you, uh,
when they make the next move.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.919
Thanks.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.718
You looking for me?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.768
Hello, Kalinda.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.360
I was wondering
when you'd contact me.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.038
Well, you can stop wondering.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.061
One more thing off the list.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.407
So...

21:19.440 --> 21:20.702
maybe you
can help me

21:20.740 --> 21:22.731
with a problem
I'm having.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.419
Oh, I was just thinking
about recording.

21:27.450 --> 21:29.372
An old lawyer's habit.

21:29.420 --> 21:32.412
So... what's the problem?

21:32.450 --> 21:34.054
Problem?
Mm.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.557
Do you know a good frozen pizza?

21:35.590 --> 21:36.909
No.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.884
My wife says
Pizza in the Wall.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.420
Now, I've never
tried it.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.052
Listen to me, Mr. Lester,

21:43.100 --> 21:45.796
I'm limited for time, so, um...

21:45.830 --> 21:47.092
Do you have a question?
Yes.

21:47.130 --> 21:48.995
Did you betray Mr. Bishop?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.462
No.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.863
And yet you ran.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.104
I didn't run.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.072
You canceled
your cell plan.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.543
In Mr. Bishop's
line of work,

21:58.580 --> 22:01.071
those are very
suspicious acts.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.519
I read the writing
on the wall.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.438
Really? What writing
was that?

22:04.490 --> 22:07.357
Dexter was blaming me

22:07.390 --> 22:09.881
for Bishop's arrest.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.126
Well, I will admit,

22:11.160 --> 22:14.357
my suspicions fall
between him and you.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.858
But Dexter has the advantage
because he's actually here,

22:17.900 --> 22:19.128
talking to
Mr. Bishop.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.365
You're not.
(chuckles)

22:21.400 --> 22:25.359
Hey! Pizza
in the Wall it is.

22:25.410 --> 22:28.402
I'll make a deal
with you, Mr. Lester.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.079
You leave my work
and my friends alone,

22:31.110 --> 22:33.908
and I will come
and see Mr. Bishop.

22:33.950 --> 22:36.373
And who do we define
as your friends?

22:36.420 --> 22:37.580
You know who.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.815
Look, I will make my
case to Mr. Bishop,

22:39.850 --> 22:42.557
but you need to but
out of my life.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.478
When could you meet
with him?

22:44.530 --> 22:47.090
Wednesday.
8:00.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.098
_ _In the
Vi5iting room.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.927
Earlier
would be better.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.393
(chuckles)

22:54.640 --> 22:56.767
Wait, what
about my phone?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.665
Buy a new one.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.598
(sighs)

23:00.640 --> 23:02.505
BAILIFF:
All rise!

23:02.540 --> 23:05.077
What's going on, Matan?

23:05.110 --> 23:06.998
Have you got him or not?

23:07.050 --> 23:09.644
This is all news
to me, Your Honor.
I don't approve

23:09.680 --> 23:12.444
of Mrs. Florrick and
Mr. Polmar's little ploy.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.185
It does seem_
the police were tricked

23:14.220 --> 23:17.758
into calling this nonexistent
doctor. However, they admitted

23:17.790 --> 23:19.155
to having their client.
Yes,

23:19.190 --> 23:21.158
and I contacted the
officers at Homan Square,

23:21.200 --> 23:23.088
but they insist, at the time
of the habeas hearing yesterday,

23:23.130 --> 23:24.495
they did not have Mr. Rickter.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.168
That is 3.5.,
Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick,

23:26.200 --> 23:27.667
you're winning here.
Be gracious.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.691
This is my ruling.
I want the police

23:29.740 --> 23:36.009
to open the Homan Square doors
to Mr. Rickter's lawyers now.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.109
(gavelbangs)

23:37.140 --> 23:39.142
Good. Our first win.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.647
Well, don't count
your chickens.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.443
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick.
Oh.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.608
Mr. Kingsley-Weaver. Did we have
a meeting today? Um, Finn,

23:45.650 --> 23:47.515
this is my ghostwriter.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.516
Oh, really? Wow.
That's, um...

23:49.560 --> 23:51.448
impressive.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.993
I just heard you were
in court this afternoon,

23:54.030 --> 23:56.521
and I thought it might help
with the writing of the memoir.
Oh, actually,

23:56.560 --> 23:58.198
today I'm just a bit busy.

23:58.230 --> 24:01.734
Perfect. I'll just
stay out of your way.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.800
(overlapping arguing)
Look, we have
to fire her!

24:05.840 --> 24:08.104
We don't know if Canning
put her here as a spy.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.903
Come on.
She's not a spy.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.579
I talked to her.
She used her maiden name.
Oh, because

24:12.610 --> 24:14.874
she's worried about nepotism?
Seriously?
Yes.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.911
And she's doing good work.
Look,

24:16.950 --> 24:20.488
she goes home to Canning
and talks, pillow talk.
She promised not

24:20.520 --> 24:22.818
to share
confidential information.
And she might not even know

24:22.860 --> 24:25.078
she's sharing it.
I know Canning.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.222
He'll use anything.
CARY:
I agree.

24:26.260 --> 24:27.227
We have to let her go.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.750
We just had
a cyber-attack

24:28.800 --> 24:31.223
on our e-mail system
that almost destroyed us.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.124
Can't keep dropping our guard.
Good.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.091
I'll fire her.
No.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.267
Two name partners against one,
Diane.
No,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.029
I'll do it.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.237
I don't...

24:41.280 --> 24:43.271
We're just
economizing.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.278
Y... I'm... Please don't fire...

24:45.310 --> 24:47.278
(clears throat)
I can do more.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.517
You know, I can work harder.
It's not that.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.279
You were doing great,
and we'll give you

24:51.320 --> 24:52.287
a good reference.
There are

24:52.320 --> 24:53.981
no other jobs out there.

24:54.020 --> 24:57.285
Well, maybe with your husband.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.878
(chuckles)

25:00.600 --> 25:03.160
I did this on my own.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.668
This was me.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.668
I know.

25:07.700 --> 25:11.807
I'm so very sorry.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.748
I have a court order for you...

25:19.780 --> 25:22.578
I have a court order
for you to allow me

25:22.620 --> 25:23.848
to see my client.
Yes, we
received word

25:23.890 --> 25:25.243
from the court.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.746
And good news, Mrs. Florrick,

25:26.790 --> 25:28.758
he's already meeting
with his lawyer.

25:28.790 --> 25:30.758
Excuse me?

25:30.790 --> 25:32.587
Mr. Rickter is already
meeting with his lavwer.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.257
I'm his lavwer.
Not according

25:34.300 --> 25:36.860
to Mr. Rickter. He's already
talking with his lavwer.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.562
I want to see him now.
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Florrick,

25:39.600 --> 25:41.295
but he is in a meeting
with his lawyer.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.261
I know you're
desperate

25:42.300 --> 25:43.665
for his business.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.979
The judge is gonna
crucify you.

25:48.010 --> 25:51.309
Have a nice day.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.739
Meet me in court.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.146
They're screwing with us.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.280
(overlapping arguing)

26:02.320 --> 26:04.254
Okay.

26:04.290 --> 26:06.850
Notice how calm I am.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.688
Let me speak
this clearly

26:09.730 --> 26:11.698
and simply, Mr. Brody.

26:11.730 --> 26:16.269
I want Mr. Rickter here,
in my court, today.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.734
If he is not here
in the next two hours,

26:18.770 --> 26:21.000
I will hold you
personally in contempt.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.043
And I will begin
assigning fines.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.139
Are my words clear?
They are,
Your Honor.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.341
He will be here in two hours.
(gavelbangs)

26:28.380 --> 26:31.838
So this is a standard case
for your new firm?

26:31.890 --> 26:33.380
Well, he's only
my second client,

26:33.420 --> 26:35.388
so it's too
early to tell.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.308
Why are you doing this?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.328
Is it about injustice?
He needed help.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.089
It's like a puzzle.

26:41.130 --> 26:43.348
How do you get the law
to help someone?
But...

26:43.400 --> 26:44.890
you care?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.267
You care?

26:53.110 --> 26:54.907
Do I care?
Yes. Um...

26:54.940 --> 26:56.908
What-what is that,
a rough draft?

26:56.940 --> 26:59.408
Yes. I like to give
my notes some shape.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.974
But it's not really
a narrative yet.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.647
May I see it?

27:02.680 --> 27:04.784
Actually, let me
get it in better shape.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.117
Whose notes are those?

27:06.150 --> 27:08.311
Oh, just... feedback.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.181
Feedback from whom?

27:11.230 --> 27:12.322
Eli?

27:12.360 --> 27:13.850
(chuckles)

27:13.900 --> 27:15.356
I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.289
It's my memoir, right?

27:26.410 --> 27:28.378
I'll be right back.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.713
You rang, Madam First Lady?

27:34.750 --> 27:36.445
Sit down, Eli.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.119
I would, but I-I don't
like sitting on steps.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.710
I always think
dogs urinate there.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.352
Whose idea was the memoir?

27:43.390 --> 27:45.688
Whose idea? Mine.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.357
And what was the point?

27:47.390 --> 27:49.392
To introduce you
to the public.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.193
To rehabilitate me.
I wouldn't put it that way.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.868
But sure, it's a
good way to put

27:52.900 --> 27:54.731
the state's attorney's
race behind you.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.058
"Too much ball busting.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.068
"Softer words needed.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.931
Why the emphasis
on work versus home?"
Where'd you get that?

28:01.980 --> 28:03.106
"Rethink."
Are these your edits?

28:03.140 --> 28:04.869
Well...

28:04.910 --> 28:06.275
yes.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.073
So, you're remaking me as...

28:08.120 --> 28:09.815
a homemaker?
No.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.386
But the ghostwriter wanted
to drive it towards

28:11.420 --> 28:13.718
courtroom and action,
and I just wanted it...

28:13.760 --> 28:15.785
a bit more balanced.
So, you want me to play

28:15.820 --> 28:18.050
the wife...
with the cookie recipes?

28:18.090 --> 28:19.978
Alicia, no.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.952
"Ask A. for possible
recipes here."

28:22.000 --> 28:24.423
Okay, that was a bad idea.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.721
Don't patronize me, Eli.

28:25.770 --> 28:26.964
I read your notes.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.888
It's a good story.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.293
It's a story with a lesson.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.137
But it's not true.
What's "true"?!

28:32.170 --> 28:33.831
Okay.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.973
No to this.

28:36.010 --> 28:38.171
No to being First Lady.
No to everything.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.414
Jacob, thank God.
Are you okay?

28:42.450 --> 28:43.849
I'm good.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.778
But I should've
taken your advice.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.310
With?
About the business.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.250
Going slow.
Why? What's wrong?

28:49.290 --> 28:50.757
MORRIS:
Mr. Rickter, finally!

28:50.790 --> 28:52.428
There was a Godot-like quality

28:52.460 --> 28:54.451
to our experiences...
Your Honor,

28:54.500 --> 28:56.798
ifI may interject?
Mr. Rickter has confessed

28:56.830 --> 28:59.025
to an intent to acquire
25 marijuana plants.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.061
What?!
A class-three felony

29:01.100 --> 29:03.239
with a minimum sentence
of two to five years.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.067
He had no representation.
We had no access to him.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.509
He did not ask for a lawyer.

29:06.540 --> 29:08.770
So no lavwer was provided.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.869
He was held in Homan Square...
Yes. But now we're addressing

29:10.910 --> 29:12.502
a different matter, Counselors.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.814
I imagine you would
move to throw out

29:14.850 --> 29:16.374
this confession.
Yes, Your Honor, definitely.

29:16.420 --> 29:17.785
I will hear arguments
on this tomorrow.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.219
Mr. Rickter, you will stay

29:19.250 --> 29:20.410
in our custody until then.

29:20.450 --> 29:21.883
Have a good evening.
(bangs gavel)

29:21.920 --> 29:24.286
(indistinct chatter)

29:27.160 --> 29:29.424
He never asked
for an attorney.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.564
Yes, but did they
Mirandize him?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.192
Because the
confessmn is illegal

29:33.230 --> 29:34.936
if they never read him
his Miranda rights.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.562
Well, they'll just argue
that he was never under arrest.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.261
So we'll refute that.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.130
Put Jacob on the stand?

29:40.170 --> 29:42.206
Right. Good!

29:42.240 --> 29:44.242
(mouth full):
Okay, good.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.872
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.310
Have a good night.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.858
I thought you were gone.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.289
I was.
Charles Lester

30:01.330 --> 30:02.422
is asking about you.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.825
I don't think it's safe here.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.088
It is for five minutes.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.166
Tequila.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.599
You sure?

30:09.640 --> 30:11.232
Yeah.

30:11.270 --> 30:12.532
For the road.

30:12.570 --> 30:15.073
(laughs)

30:15.110 --> 30:17.840
I left you a note, Alicia.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.347
You didn't give it to Lester?

30:19.380 --> 30:20.574
I didn't want to.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.879
It's a confession.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.184
I left it in case
anyone came after me.

30:26.220 --> 30:27.983
It gets you off
the hook, Alicia.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.817
You need to give
him the note.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.491
I'm serious, Alicia.

30:35.530 --> 30:39.318
You need to give him the note.

30:39.370 --> 30:42.862
A great thing happened
when I lost the election.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.959
I gave up.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.309
Anger, jealousy...
what people thought--

30:48.340 --> 30:50.877
I just threw them overboard.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.448
It's nice not to care.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.584
(quiet laugh)

30:59.620 --> 31:02.418
_ It made me miss
just Sitting in a bar...

31:02.460 --> 31:04.428
drinking...

31:04.460 --> 31:06.485
with you.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.421
One more?

31:16.640 --> 31:19.962
Alicia, I, uh...

31:20.010 --> 31:22.934
I don't really...

31:22.980 --> 31:24.948
I'm not very good at talking.

31:24.980 --> 31:28.541
I never have been, but...

31:28.580 --> 31:32.311
I do need to say this.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.318
My time with you

31:34.360 --> 31:36.316
as your friend was,

31:36.360 --> 31:38.328
was the best I ever had.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.955
And... I'm sorry.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.161
And I'm...

31:44.200 --> 31:47.897
I'm really sorry that
things got messed up.

31:53.010 --> 31:57.003
I wish we had the chance
to... do it over again.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.388
I have to go.

32:10.420 --> 32:13.355
I'll never see you again?

32:13.390 --> 32:15.426
I don't think so.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.332
That's too bad.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.964
I, um...

32:29.780 --> 32:32.704
Good-bye.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.071
*

32:37.720 --> 32:40.314
Bye.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.351
(elevator bell dings)

32:59.170 --> 33:00.307
Damn you!

33:00.340 --> 33:01.329
Damn you three!

33:01.380 --> 33:02.631
Mr. Canning.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.476
You've hurt the
one person I love

33:03.510 --> 33:04.670
more than anything
on this planet.

33:04.710 --> 33:05.779
Your wife was
working here as...

33:05.810 --> 33:06.777
She's sobbing at home!

33:06.810 --> 33:08.778
She's inconsolable.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.118
You know, I've never, in-in
all our years of struggle,

33:11.150 --> 33:13.345
I have never gone after any
of your family members.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.688
We have no family members.
It's always been business
first, but no more.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.608
And I-I'm gonna burn
this place to the ground.

33:17.660 --> 33:19.628
I'd watch your
words, Mr. Canning.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.628
I want to be methodical about
this; I want to take my time.

33:21.660 --> 33:24.220
Just know this-- I will
pull you three apart

33:24.270 --> 33:26.363
until_there's
nothing left.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.231
What can he do?
Nothing.

33:30.270 --> 33:33.068
He's a wounded
beast, crying out.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.533
Best just to
turn away.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.502
I_ was handcuffed
in a small room.

33:37.540 --> 33:38.700
POLMAR:
With bars?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.342
Yes.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.540
Was there anyone
else in this room?

33:41.580 --> 33:43.172
Now and then,
they'd bring someone in,

33:43.220 --> 33:45.188
cuff him beside me
and then take him out.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.187
Were you fed?

33:46.220 --> 33:47.187
Once.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.187
A bologna sandwich.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.710
Did anyone tell you

33:49.760 --> 33:51.352
that you could
have an attorney?

33:51.390 --> 33:52.357
No.

33:52.390 --> 33:53.721
Why did you confess?

33:53.760 --> 33:56.695
Because they said
they'd let me go.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.391
Your Honor,

33:58.430 --> 34:00.796
Homan Square has been called
Chicago's "black site."

34:00.830 --> 34:03.594
Come on.
Well, what else
would you call it?

34:03.640 --> 34:07.235
A place where citizens are
taken without warrant,

34:07.270 --> 34:09.238
without warning,
without rights,

34:09.280 --> 34:10.406
and then questioned

34:10.440 --> 34:11.600
until they confess.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.800
Now, Your Honor,
I am staggered

34:13.850 --> 34:15.442
that we still have
to stand here

34:15.480 --> 34:17.448
and argue over the
legality of this.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.084
The confession should be
thrown out, Your Honor.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.087
It was coerced.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.280
He was a danger
to himself,

34:21.320 --> 34:22.412
that's why
we cuffed him.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.654
It's police policy.

34:23.690 --> 34:24.622
Why did you not tell
him his rights?

34:24.660 --> 34:26.719
Because he was not
under arrest.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.455
Thank you, Officer.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.668
When the judge
ordered you

34:33.700 --> 34:35.668
to grant me access
to Mr. Rickter,

34:35.700 --> 34:37.099
did you deny it to me?

34:37.140 --> 34:38.767
I'm embarrassed
to say that I did.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.163
I made a mistake.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.734
I thought it was Mr. Rickter
who had a lavwer,

34:41.780 --> 34:43.179
but it was
another person.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.746
What was the name of
this "other person"?

34:44.780 --> 34:46.771
You know, I don't remember.

34:46.810 --> 34:48.675
Really? How
surprising.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.812
The snark is uncalled for,
Your Honor.

34:49.850 --> 34:50.839
The simple truth, ma'am,

34:50.880 --> 34:52.142
is that we did nothing wrong.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.543
Your client confessed

34:53.590 --> 34:54.750
while he was
in our care

34:54.790 --> 34:56.610
and not under arrest.

34:56.660 --> 34:59.584
I'd be more upset about
your client's crimes

34:59.630 --> 35:01.791
than about our mistakes.

35:04.830 --> 35:07.799
So we need_ someone
on the in5ide

35:07.830 --> 35:10.765
to substantiate
Rickter's account.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.529
Officer Tannerman?
Do you think
he'll talk?

35:12.570 --> 35:13.559
Our best bet.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.449
You sounded good
in court today.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.708
Yeah? The speech?

35:23.650 --> 35:25.641
I don't give many of
those-- I was angry.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.758
And look how
effective that was.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.155
(laughs)

35:33.190 --> 35:34.589
(chuckles)

35:34.630 --> 35:37.519
Well, it looks good
on you-- anger.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.601
(sighs)

35:52.780 --> 35:53.940
I got to go.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.914
Right, I know.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.315
Yeah, it's
getting late.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.944
9:00.

35:59.990 --> 36:03.710
Well, ifI stay, I'll just
get sloppy, and then...

36:03.760 --> 36:05.352
something or other,

36:05.390 --> 36:07.187
and then I don't know
what will happen.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.629
Something bad?

36:11.470 --> 36:12.892
Very bad.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.911
(elevator bell dings)

36:36.390 --> 36:38.255
Mrs. Florrick.

36:38.290 --> 36:39.689
It's kismet.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.425
I just was knocking
on your door.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.859
Really?
Do you have a minute?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.492
Sure.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.731
Do you want me
to wait here?

36:48.770 --> 36:50.397
No, come on in.

36:54.510 --> 36:56.899
I hate to return
to old subjects,

36:56.940 --> 37:01.616
but, uh, Kalinda promised to
meet with Mr. Bishop yesterday,

37:01.650 --> 37:03.618
and she never
showed up.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.618
Do you know
what happened?

37:05.650 --> 37:06.844
No.

37:09.490 --> 37:13.859
Well, has Kalinda been
in touch with you?

37:13.890 --> 37:17.326
Just one moment,
Mr. Lester.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.332
What is that?

37:23.370 --> 37:25.008
It's Kalinda's
letter to me.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.739
Why did you do that?

37:30.680 --> 37:32.648
I didn't want you
to have it.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.841
What did it say?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.848
It said good-bye.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.882
Good-bye, Mr. Lester.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.787
POLMAR: Now, your
fellow officer stated

37:46.830 --> 37:50.391
that Mr. Rickter was a danger
to himself and others.

37:50.430 --> 37:54.434
Was that your
observation, too?

37:56.570 --> 37:58.936
MORRIS:
Officer Tannerman?

37:58.970 --> 38:00.562
Um...

38:00.610 --> 38:02.908
I was not in a position
to make any observation.

38:02.940 --> 38:05.500
But you saw Mr. Rickter being
brought in to Homan Square?

38:05.550 --> 38:06.505
No, I did not.

38:06.550 --> 38:07.574
You didn't?

38:07.610 --> 38:09.419
But you told
Mrs. Florrick

38:09.450 --> 38:11.611
that you saw her client
being brought in.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.413
Yes, I made a mistake.

38:13.450 --> 38:16.419
Oh, you made a mistake
that you saw Mr. Rickter.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.813
Oh, well...

38:17.860 --> 38:19.521
Yes, I only heard over the radio

38:19.560 --> 38:21.357
that they were
bringing in a 10-26.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.628
That's all.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.598
10-26-- you're sure that
was, that was Jacob Rickter?

38:26.630 --> 38:28.461
Yes, that's all
I know.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.639
I didn't actually see
them bring him in.
POLMAR: 10-26.

38:30.670 --> 38:33.434
Ten-twenty... what
is a 10-26, Officer?

38:33.470 --> 38:35.506
Chicago police code
for detained arrestee.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.077
And Jacob Rickter was
that detained arrestee.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.907
Objection. Counselor is putting
words in the witness' mouth.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.679
From their own
words, Your Honor.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.109
Because they believe that our
client was already under arrest,

38:44.150 --> 38:46.118
and therefore he should
have been Mirandized

38:46.150 --> 38:47.640
and offered the
serwces of a lawyer.

38:47.690 --> 38:50.386
This was a slip on the radio,
Your Honor, that's all.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.318
MORRIS:
Officer Tannerman,

38:51.360 --> 38:55.091
did you clearly hear
Mr. Rickter referred to

38:55.130 --> 38:57.690
by the 10-26
designation?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.532
Yes, I did.

39:03.570 --> 39:04.730
MORRIS:
Then I have no choice

39:04.770 --> 39:06.761
but throw out the confession
of Mr. Rickter.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.778
Yes!
Motion sustained,
we are adjourned.

39:08.810 --> 39:10.402
(gavel slams)

39:10.440 --> 39:11.907
Good job, partner.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.738
So this phone here, could you
tell me something ab...?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.042
Hello.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.413
Ah, thank you,
Kalinda.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.451
Hate getting
new phones.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.085
So you didn't show up
for your talk with Bishop.

39:28.130 --> 39:29.722
Uh, he was
disappointed.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.729
I was planning to see
him, but then I realized

39:32.770 --> 39:34.567
Bishop's leaving
the business,

39:34.600 --> 39:36.568
he's giving it
all to Dexter,

39:36.600 --> 39:38.409
so what's the point
in meeting him?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.566
He has no power.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.578
I don't think
it's a good idea

39:41.610 --> 39:43.475
to test
Mr. Bishop's power.

39:43.510 --> 39:45.444
Why not?

39:47.810 --> 39:50.813
Because he has people like me
working for him.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.659
You know, uh, I downloaded
a flash drive of data

39:55.690 --> 39:58.659
from Bishop's computer, and
it had receipts and notes

39:58.690 --> 40:01.750
on your, uh,
employment.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.098
But I didn't
see a reason

40:04.130 --> 40:06.690
to give it to the state's
attorney's office.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.766
You could always
give me a reason.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.939
That's a bluff.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.460
No.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.809
What is it with all
these tough-talking women?

40:16.840 --> 40:19.809
You know a word you don't
hear very much anymore?

40:19.850 --> 40:21.442
Demure.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.516
How about bringing
that one back?

40:23.550 --> 40:25.609
Sounds like
you're stalling.

40:25.650 --> 40:27.618
(sighs)

40:27.650 --> 40:29.618
All right, okay.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.753
I couldn't find you,
I looked and looked,

40:31.790 --> 40:33.451
but you were gone.

40:33.490 --> 40:37.494
Now, don't make me a liar
by coming back, okay?

40:37.530 --> 40:39.691
Don't worry.

40:39.730 --> 40:40.958
Wait.

40:43.140 --> 40:47.839
Are you sure you wouldn't want
to start up something together?

40:47.870 --> 40:50.668
A business?

40:50.710 --> 40:52.143
We could dominate.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.978
No, uh...

40:57.250 --> 40:59.445
I'm good.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.628
Oh, good.

41:14.670 --> 41:15.864
Hi.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.868
I was just thinking
about the other night.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.868
Yeah, me, too.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.935
And I was thinking that
we can really make this work.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.574
I was looking online
at office spaces,

41:24.610 --> 41:26.578
and if we don't want too much
space, it's really pretty cheap.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.612
Alicia.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.242
That doesn't
sound good.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.152
I can't be doing this.

41:36.190 --> 41:38.078
Doing what?

41:40.090 --> 41:42.888
There's, um...

41:42.930 --> 41:44.727
something...

41:44.770 --> 41:46.169
between us.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.792
And we push it,

41:49.840 --> 41:50.989
and then we
say we won't,

41:51.040 --> 41:53.907
and then we push
it again, and...

41:53.940 --> 41:55.976
I can't live that way.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.170
I can't.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.701
We don't have
to push it.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.718
I know.

42:01.750 --> 42:05.208
But it's not always
"do" or "don't."

42:08.760 --> 42:09.715
(sighs)

42:09.760 --> 42:11.159
I don't want
