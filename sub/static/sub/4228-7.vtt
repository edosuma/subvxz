WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:06.590
We're here.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.009
This is where the rebel leader
said to meet.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.440
Can I ask you a question, Dad?

00:22.606 --> 00:23.774
Always.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.986
After we find Anne and Alexis,

00:27.194 --> 00:28.779
will we go back to Charleston?

00:30.239 --> 00:31.699
I don't know, Ben.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.118
I'm not sure there's much
of a future for us there.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.746
Why? Do you want to?

00:37.288 --> 00:38.831
Uh, made some friends there,
you know?

00:38.998 --> 00:40.624
People I'll... people I'll miss.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.834
Like Denny?

00:42.001 --> 00:43.669
She won't have a problem
with the fact

00:43.836 --> 00:46.922
that my sister's a half-alien,
but the others?

00:47.089 --> 00:48.841
Lexie will be treated like a freak.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.468
Like you were.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.345
I was, uh, old enough
to deal with it.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.182
But a small child? I... I don't want
her to have to go through that.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.641
Neither do I.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.521
So, uh, if we don't go back,
what'll we do?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.816
We keep moving. Keep fighting.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.445
Honestly, I haven't really
thought that far ahead.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.157
First task is to get to
Mechanicsville, find Anne and Lexie.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.495
Their new leader...
he seems pretty full of himself.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.747
Yeah, he makes me nervous
when I'm channeling him.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.583
- It's different than Red Eye?
- Very. He's more...

01:22.750 --> 01:24.668
- Aggressive?
- Impatient.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.212
Completely loyal
to the cause, though.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.255
He and the others almost
treat Red Eye like a god.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.716
Reaching out to humans...

01:30.883 --> 01:33.177
That took a lot of risk.
Took a lot of...

01:33.344 --> 01:35.304
(ROARING)

01:44.855 --> 01:46.107
They're coming.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.942
- Who's coming?
- Enemy patrol.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.819
They're searching for you.
You must divert.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.487
Which way are they coming from?

01:51.654 --> 01:53.072
Which way are they coming from?

01:58.661 --> 02:00.496
(GROWLING)

02:22.643 --> 02:24.145
You're probably too young to remember

02:24.311 --> 02:26.480
that camping jag Mom and Dad were on.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.065
Talking about
every other weekend,

02:28.232 --> 02:29.942
we'd head out to the Berkshires,

02:30.109 --> 02:32.153
set up camp,
Dad would get to cooking.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.989
Bacon, eggs, biscuits.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.699
I kind of remember that.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.660
Yeah? Well, I hate to say it,

02:39.869 --> 02:43.205
but we have oatmeal and grits,

02:43.372 --> 02:45.082
a little bit of coffee.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.752
Food always tastes better
when you're starving.

02:49.587 --> 02:50.754
I guess.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.882
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

02:55.342 --> 02:57.928
- it's weird, you know?
- What's that, buddy?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.763
It's like the war
never happened here.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.265
Yeah, I know, right?

03:02.016 --> 03:03.726
Especially after everything
we've been through.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.022
Makes you wonder what would have
happened if we had just come up here.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.818
But I suppose Dad would have never
let me shoot a gun, huh?

03:12.985 --> 03:14.778
(LAUGHS) That's for sure.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.242
But when we find Anne and Lexie...

03:21.493 --> 03:23.913
I don't know, maybe Dad
will want to come back here.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.541
Or someplace
where there aren't any Skitters.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.043
Maybe.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.711
(HORSE WHINNIES)

03:30.878 --> 03:32.004
They're back.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.131
Come on, boys! We got to get going!

03:34.340 --> 03:35.799
Skitters and Mechs on their way!

03:35.966 --> 03:38.677
All right, get that stuff.
Let's go. Pack it up.

03:40.471 --> 03:43.182
The good news is business
is booming, profits are up.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.725
The bad news is so what?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.852
(CHUCKLES) Well, we got more credits
than we know what to do with.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.312
That's my whole point, right?

03:48.479 --> 03:51.440
What the hell am I gonna do
with all that pieces of paper, right?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.692
Get myself a new tube of toothpaste?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.527
Yeah, but someday...

03:55.694 --> 03:58.656
The future's not ours to see, Lyle.
It's carpe diem.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.158
- Grab what you can and grab it fast.
- Yep.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.289
What we need is someone
or something to trade with,

04:07.456 --> 04:08.916
another community or something.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.752
Maybe like the one
where President Hathaway was.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.046
Actually, that's
an almost-brilliant idea.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.173
(LOUD CRASHING)

04:20.094 --> 04:21.387
The hell do you think you're doing?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.806
Getting ready to tow this... thing.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.392
- No, you are not.
- No, I am, Pope.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.644
In fact, this whole area
is being cleared out.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.604
Cleared out, my ass.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.065
On whose orders?

04:33.232 --> 04:36.527
By order of the President
of the new United States, Pope.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.862
So I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.991
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.909
When the mouse is away, the cat...

04:44.076 --> 04:46.120
takes pretty much whatever the hell
she feels like, is that it?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.622
Refugees keep pouring in every day.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.874
Housing below the city
is at maximum capacity.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.293
Ms. Peralta wants to make room,

04:52.501 --> 04:56.297
and Pope Town, including your bar,
is the most logical choice.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.215
It's the worst possible choice, Cap.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.009
People need a place
to blow off steam.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.552
You can't keep that kind
of pressure building up.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.178
Keep your powder dry, Pope.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.806
You're not being closed.
You're just being moved.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.516

- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.735

Please, hurry.

- It's acne.
- Acne?

Drop your weapons! Now!

06:31.058 --> 06:33.060
Friend, I always tell my boys

06:33.227 --> 06:36.021
it's best to look before leaping.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.776
Ben.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.117
What do you want with us?

06:48.283 --> 06:49.493
Right now, I want you
to get off your horses,

06:49.701 --> 06:52.454
lay your weapons on the ground.
Do it quick!

06:59.128 --> 07:01.839
If we wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead half a mile back.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.674
We just want your horses
and your supplies,

07:03.841 --> 07:05.342
then we'll be on our ways.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.470
Y'all just be smart now.
Do exactly as you're told.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.222
No one needs to get hurt.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.599

07:17.855 --> 07:18.856
Easy, now.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.608
You folks been living out here
since the invasion?

07:23.277 --> 07:24.903
We just came from Charleston.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.534
- I guess you haven't heard.
- Heard what?

07:30.701 --> 07:32.828
That there's thousands of survivors,

07:32.995 --> 07:34.580
just like you, gathered there.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.375
- Why?
- We're helping each other.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.586
Planting crops. We got livestock.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.255
- Nobody's going hungry.
- Even formed a government.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.425
- And an army.
- Army?

07:48.093 --> 07:50.804
Who you planning to fight,
little man?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.391
The aliens.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.311
Is that so?

07:58.937 --> 07:59.938
That is so.

of your ever-loving mind.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.132
We go after them,
get our stuff back.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.092
Damn straight we will.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.261
We got to be smart about it.
We got to be fast about it.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.971
We got to get to Anne and Lexie.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.099
We attempted
to contact your headquarters

08:36.266 --> 08:37.976
through the frequency
you gave us, Mr. President,

08:38.143 --> 08:39.603
but so far have had no luck.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.189
Well, keep trying, colonel.
They will answer eventually.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.398
Yes, sir.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.526
In the meantime, all of
Charleston is at your disposal.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.611
Thank you, Ms. Peralta.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.365
Your name sounds familiar.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.535
Weren't you in Jim Webb's office?

08:54.701 --> 08:58.413
Yes. I was his chief
administrative assistant.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.249
I knew it, yeah.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.377
"Feisty" he called you,
as I remember.

09:03.544 --> 09:07.005
He used to say, "you don't want to
have Marina barking up your tree."

09:07.172 --> 09:08.507
(CHUCKLES)

09:08.674 --> 09:11.009
The senator
did have a way with words, sir.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.516
- He didn't make it?
- No. I'm afraid not.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.060
But you did, Mr. President.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.396
Twice, and that is
nothing short of a miracle.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.898
The miracle is standing
right here beside me.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.818
I did nothing more
than shield President Hathaway

09:28.026 --> 09:29.945
from the impact
when the airplane crashed.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.613
How is that possible?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.783
Volm bodies are adapted
genetically for combat.

09:34.950 --> 09:38.370
And, consequently, we can withstand
much greater levels of stress.

09:39.204 --> 09:43.542
Cochise tells me that the
Volm weapon is almost complete.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.920
Even with the delays,
I assure you we will be ready

09:47.087 --> 09:50.132
to attack the Espheni defense
grid in less than two weeks.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.843
- I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you mean?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.137
There are some serious
unanswered questions.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.723
According to my science advisor,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.725
your device
will deliver far more power

09:59.891 --> 10:01.852
than the weapon
you described to us.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.270
That is true.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.148
Unfortunately,
I'm not at liberty to give you

10:06.315 --> 10:09.026
any more information at this time.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.653
As you well know,
there have been security leaks

10:11.820 --> 10:13.488
within Charleston's
command structure.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.490
If you're referring
to the Espheni spy,

10:15.657 --> 10:18.827
- that issue has been resolved.
- In what way?

10:19.036 --> 10:20.829
By removing the Espheni probe
from Hal Mason,

10:20.996 --> 10:22.581
we no longer have a security leak.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.249
Pardon me for saying so,

10:24.416 --> 10:27.085
but that is
a dangerous supposition.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.922
The Espheni are far too clever
to rely on just one strategy.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.716
So the intricacies of our device

10:32.883 --> 10:36.011
must remain confidential
at this time, Ms. Peralta.

10:36.595 --> 10:37.971
- Mr. President...
- The outcome of the war

10:38.180 --> 10:40.766
depends on the completion
and deployment of that weapon.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.393
There can't be
any further delays.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.646
Even if we don't know
what this thing does?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.523
Colonel?

10:49.441 --> 10:53.278
Well, sir, it's hard to argue
against the benefits we've gained

10:53.445 --> 10:55.947
by allying ourselves
with Cochise and the Volm,

10:56.114 --> 10:58.116
but I've always believed
that this should be

10:58.283 --> 11:01.828
a human-led operation
with the Volm providing support.

11:02.037 --> 11:06.958
I agree with Ms. Peralta
that less-than-complete disclosure

11:07.125 --> 11:10.087
is not in the spirit
of true cooperation.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.674
Noted. And thank you
for your candor.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.802
But the mission must go ahead
as scheduled.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.846
And perhaps it would be best

11:20.013 --> 11:23.100
if I were to inspect this weapon
with my own eyes.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.268
As you wish.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.286
(HORSE NICKERING)

11:43.453 --> 11:45.163

these saddles off, Boo?

11:46.498 --> 11:47.833
Oh!

11:49.084 --> 11:51.503
It's not a bad haul for
half a day's work, huh, Dad?

11:52.087 --> 11:54.840
Sorted and shelled
in 20 minutes, boys.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.758
Yes, sir.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.052
Bet these guys are thirsty.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.847
Then fetch them some water, girl.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.932
- (CHUCKLES)
- Come on, now, boys.

12:04.099 --> 12:07.102
You know the pump's stuck.
You're the one who stuck it.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.603

12:09.980 --> 12:11.356

About everything.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.003
I wouldn't know where to start.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.298
You know, when we
took your harness off,

12:36.465 --> 12:37.841
I figured I knew
what you were going through.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.134
But, quite frankly,
I'm a little embarrassed

12:39.301 --> 12:41.052
by some of the advice I gave you.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.722
I just can't stop thinking about
the fact that there I was,

12:43.889 --> 12:47.225
sleeping right next
to Maggie every night.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.895
And she stuck with me.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.231
Had no idea I had that... thing

12:53.440 --> 12:56.693
inside of me for months,
and, I mean, there's just no telling

12:56.860 --> 12:58.111
what I could have
even done to her.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.030
Is that why you...
you didn't let her come with us?

13:01.156 --> 13:02.741
We don't know
what we're getting into.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.284
You know, I've already
put her through enough.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.412
What's up?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.539
They've stopped moving.
We're getting closer.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.541
Or they've reached
their home base.

13:13.835 --> 13:18.256
(SIGHS) OK, everybody move
as quietly as they can.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.050
Come on.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.516
Lazy jerks.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.102
(WHISPERING) Shh. Matt, Matt.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.439
Shh. Don't make a sound, OK?

13:34.606 --> 13:35.941
OK.

13:44.616 --> 13:48.078
- Marinara sauce with meatballs.
- Sounds delicious.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.291
(GRUNTING)

13:56.211 --> 13:57.462
Don't even try it.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.426
Duane?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.730
Gil?

14:18.275 --> 14:19.651
Ohh!

14:20.861 --> 14:22.153
Don't move.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.617
- Drop it!
- In your dreams, son!

14:27.784 --> 14:30.871
(BOTH GRUNTING)

14:38.003 --> 14:39.713
(GUN FIRES)

14:41.339 --> 14:42.507
(HORSE WHINNIES)

14:49.764 --> 14:51.600
- Hal?
- I'm OK.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.108
What did you do that for?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.870
Man: Colonel, this was
supposed to carry fresh troops

15:12.037 --> 15:13.580
out to the perimeter an hour ago.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.832
All of our mechanics called in sick.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.418
And this is the third vehicle
to "break down" today.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.837
But it's not just the motor pool.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.381
The same thing happened
in the armory.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.717
We've got weapons piling up
that need to be repaired, sir.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.135
Are you saying there's
some kind of organized

15:27.302 --> 15:28.678
work slow-down
going on around here?

15:28.887 --> 15:30.388
Well, I'm not big
on conspiracy theories,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.850
but Pope has
a mighty smug look on his face.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.937
Afternoon, colonel.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.606
What the hell
are you up to, Pope?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.817
Absolutely nothing, sir.
Just having a friendly chat

15:42.984 --> 15:44.945
with a couple of citizens here
from Charleston, SC,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.697
reminding them they, in fact,
do have some rights,

15:47.864 --> 15:51.034
if this is still a democracy,
as it purports to be.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.995
If we're short vehicles,
weapons, and soldiers

15:54.204 --> 15:56.206
on the front line
when the enemy attacks,

15:56.414 --> 15:57.624
we're gonna lose a lot of people.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.126
You really want that
on your conscience?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.420
Sir, if throwing a wrench
into the works

16:02.629 --> 16:05.090
improves Ms. Peralta's hearing,
then hell yes, I do.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.176
This is no time for shenanigans.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.970
No disrespect, colonel.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.764
This is exactly the right time.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.934
First the Volm, they turn us into
their monkey-boys. Now this?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.895
Colonel, this is a bad road.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.816
I just think it'd be time
for a nice... change of pace.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.526
A new vision.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.112
Hmm.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.824
What you're talking about is not
only foolish, it's dangerous.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.450
And when Tom comes back...

16:32.617 --> 16:34.995
Tom Mason is not coming back, sir.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.871
He's smarter than all of us
put together.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.124
He knows when
to abandon a sinking ship.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.211
You pull your dogs off this bone now.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.510
Truth's a bitch, ain't it, colonel?

16:50.719 --> 16:53.680
Yes, sir. Truth is
one squirrelly bitch.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.937
- Come on.
- (WHIMPERING)

17:01.021 --> 17:02.939
Help me get his jacket off.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.033
OK. We need
to stop the bleeding.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.118
(GROANS)

17:15.285 --> 17:17.954
Some soap and water,
some... some clean towels.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.706
Come on.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.004
This is how you treat people?

17:26.171 --> 17:27.797
You come into my house,
you try to kill my brother?

17:27.964 --> 17:30.425
I wouldn't be in your house
if you hadn't robbed us.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.635
We're just trying to survive,
same as you.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.054
We don't rob people.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.222
You can see we're not exactly
living the high life here.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.725
I got kids, same as you.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.685
The aliens kidnapped
the rest of my family,

17:40.852 --> 17:42.437
and every minute I spend with you

17:42.604 --> 17:44.439
is one less minute
I spend looking for them.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.525
We've come for what's ours
and that's it... we're gone.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.235
So where's our stuff?

17:53.573 --> 17:56.201
Next to the shed, last I saw.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.369
Matt, go check on our gear
and come right back.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.080
Sure, Dad.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.837
They expect us to work for them.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.923
With the bubbleheads.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.509
No questions, no... no complaints.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.220
- Right?
- All: Yeah.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.765
And the whole time deny us
our simple pleasures.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.100
(MURMURING)

18:20.266 --> 18:23.311
I say until they rescind that
order to take what is ours

18:23.520 --> 18:25.730
to confiscate our property.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.108
We don't work for them,
and we sure as hell

18:28.274 --> 18:31.111
- don't fight for them.
- All: Yes!

18:31.277 --> 18:32.946
Pope's right.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.950
Colonel, welcome.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.244
We all need a place to unwind.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.622
I recognize that.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.875
And Ms. Peralta recognizes that.

18:47.127 --> 18:51.506
But there is no place,
in my vision of democracy,

18:51.673 --> 18:55.093
for wanton disregard of the law.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.475
Especially when it threatens
the safety of this community.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.854
And the progress of the war effort.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.439
Is that clear?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.025
(ALL MURMURING ASSENT)

19:12.318 --> 19:13.987
Pope, you're under arrest.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.616
What charges?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.994
Civil disobedience
and general unruliness.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.289
You have the authority, sir,
but you do not have the right.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.005
Drink up
and return to your quarters.

19:32.172 --> 19:36.176
Starting tomorrow,
all shifts on the Volm project

19:36.342 --> 19:38.845
will continue uninterrupted.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.222
Good night.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.356
Tom: How did you find this place?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.734
This farm's been in my family
for three generations.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.944
I was born in this house,

19:55.111 --> 19:58.364
same as my brother,
same as all my children.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.659
So you just stayed up here?
Even after the invasion?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.786
Those things never came up here.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.414
They're not interested in us.

20:06.581 --> 20:09.751
I seen the spaceships, explosions.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.961
I heard the stories.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.341
(GROANING)

20:18.718 --> 20:20.094
You think he's gonna make it?

20:20.261 --> 20:21.679
I don't know.

20:23.431 --> 20:27.310
From what I saw, though, he's
a fighter, so he's got a chance.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.896
You're damn right
he's a fighter.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.689
Uncle Gil's too mean to die.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.277
What are those things
on the back of your neck?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.239
It's a long story.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.247
The aliens put a parasite
on my back to control me.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.499
We... We tried to cut it off,

20:49.666 --> 20:51.376
but the pieces are still inside me.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.921
- That's nasty.
- Everything about them is nasty.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.756
They... they killed
a lot of my friends,

20:56.923 --> 20:58.341
murdered my mother.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.513
Hey, my mom was murdered, too.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.808
Thought you said you only
saw the aliens from a distance.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.270
It wasn't aliens.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.855
It was people.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.276
After the invasion,
a group of men came by.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.279
They said they'd been on the run
for a few days.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.406
So we brought them in
and fed them.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.910
Then they tried to rob us, so...

21:26.953 --> 21:29.122
Shot my mom
before we could stop them.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.209
You saw her die?

21:40.383 --> 21:45.471
Anyway, after that, Dad said
this is the world we live in now.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.849
Eat or be eaten.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.644
Charleston's not like that.
People look after each other.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.605
You should check it out.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.317
Dad would never go for that.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.072
You're not from
around here, are you?

22:03.239 --> 22:06.159
- You're not from Charleston, neither.
- From Boston originally.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.077
Ah, Boston.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.496
We've been fighting them since
they arrived... my boys and I.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.249
I suppose that's a legitimate choice.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.252
We figured our chances
were better right here.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.422
Sure, as long as there's plenty
of victims traveling the road.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.007
Which ain't often.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.346
You can't blame a man for trying to
keep his family alive, now, can you?

22:28.389 --> 22:30.850
You have managed
to do that so far.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.519
- Something to be said for that.
- "So far."

22:33.686 --> 22:35.855
It's only a matter of time
before the aliens find you.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.441
So we just should follow you
to your Shangri-la?

22:39.233 --> 22:40.902
I understand your anger.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.154
If that was my brother
laying up there,

22:43.321 --> 22:44.989
or one of my sons,
I'd be angry, too.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.533
You don't know the first thing about
what I'm feeling right now.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.744
Mister, you don't know
who you're talking to.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.830
Those stories you heard
are about people like us.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.042
Aliens killed my wife.

22:57.251 --> 23:00.004
I think I know
a little something about loss.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.382
And regret.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.133
It's with me every morning
when I wake up

23:04.300 --> 23:06.135
and every night
when I close my eyes.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.680
And every hour
and every minute in between.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.855
Your mountain isn't high enough,

23:18.022 --> 23:19.774
and there isn't a hole deep enough.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.484
There is no hiding.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.488
The only chance that you have,
that any of us have,

23:25.696 --> 23:27.865
is to stand together against them.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.868
- (DOOR OPENING)
- Dad!

23:31.536 --> 23:32.954
What is it, son?

23:35.039 --> 23:36.833
It's Uncle Gil.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.084
He's dying.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.593
My brother is dying.
Now, you...

23:47.760 --> 23:50.054
You give me a chance
to get up there and see him.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.392
Dad, we can't trust him.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.270
You gonna let him die
without seeing his kin?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.981
What kind of man are you?

24:07.238 --> 24:08.906
You promise you won't try anything?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.450
Mister...

24:11.367 --> 24:13.286
I give you my word.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.248
(GASPING)

24:17.415 --> 24:20.626
Gil, it's Duane.
Can you hear me?

24:20.793 --> 24:23.129
You got to fight, brother.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.798
Hey, we're all here...
all of us.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.675
Huh? You can hack it.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.636
You just got to hang on, yeah?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.021
OK.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.443
No, don't!

24:45.610 --> 24:47.987
Leave the gun on the ground.
Leave it down.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.742
Finger off the trigger.
Finger off the trigger!

25:00.082 --> 25:01.584
Hands above your head.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.007
Up against the wall,
left-hand side, boys.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.717
- Come on, right there.
- Up against the wall!

25:09.884 --> 25:11.385
Left-hand side!
Up against the wall!

25:11.552 --> 25:13.012
You gonna kill my kids?
That's who you are?

25:13.179 --> 25:16.015
It's your own damn fault!
You had to come after us!

25:16.182 --> 25:18.684
Now, if we let them go,
they will come back.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.019
Your kids are gonna
remember this moment

25:20.186 --> 25:21.646
for the rest of their lives.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.523
You're gonna turn them
into killers?

25:25.733 --> 25:27.235
No.

25:27.401 --> 25:28.486
- Dad.
- Easy, Boo.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.530
It's a harsh world, mister.

25:30.696 --> 25:34.367
My boys and my girl... they need
to get tough to survive.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.577
You don't want to do this.
You're not gonna do this!

25:36.744 --> 25:39.372
You shot my brother!
Now turn around, face the wall!

to watch you stop being human!

25:42.041 --> 25:44.043
- Put the gun down!
- No, sir.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.547
I'm gonna shoot you. Now,
you say your goodbyes to your kin.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.259
Do it now before
I send you on your way.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.219
If you're gonna shoot me,
you better have the guts

25:53.386 --> 25:55.304
to look me in the eye
when you do it!

26:02.228 --> 26:04.397
No, we're not monsters.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.858
We're just a family...

26:19.078 --> 26:20.079
No!

26:20.246 --> 26:21.789
It's all right, Boo. Hey!

26:21.956 --> 26:23.249
(GRUNTING)

26:32.091 --> 26:33.426
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.219
Duane, tell Luke
to put the gun down!

26:35.386 --> 26:38.306
- Nobody gets hurt.
- No, sir. No, sir.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.724

26:39.890 --> 26:43.060
Luke shoots me, Hal shoots Luke,

26:43.227 --> 26:44.979
and Ben shoots you.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.440
And then what?
What happens to Gil?

26:47.607 --> 26:49.108
What happens to the kids?

26:49.275 --> 26:52.445

off the trigger, son.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.660
- No.
- Put down your arm, son.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.287
Do as your daddy says!

27:05.583 --> 27:06.584
Calm down, boy.
You done good.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.628
You done good.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Coshise: Sufficient
for the task at hand.

27:37.448 --> 27:38.741
Hathaway: Will your
troop ship make it

27:38.908 --> 27:41.494
before the Espheni
activate their defensive grid?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.954
Most unlikely.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.791
Then why the hurry?

27:46.957 --> 27:48.250
Can't the ship just orbit

27:48.417 --> 27:50.461
until we can create a breach
in the defensive system?

27:50.628 --> 27:53.172
Well, as I have explained,
the Espheni grid

27:53.339 --> 27:55.758
will create an energy force
that will surround the earth.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.635
And that, by destroying
one of the towers,

27:57.802 --> 27:59.303
we'll temporarily disrupt the grid,

27:59.512 --> 28:01.180
allowing your ship
a window for entry.

28:01.347 --> 28:05.017
Correct, but long-term
effects of the grid

28:05.184 --> 28:08.187
will irradiate the surface
of the earth to such levels that...

28:08.354 --> 28:09.563
(EXHALES)

28:09.730 --> 28:13.859
it will destroy all organic
life-forms within three months.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.654
That's a nice piece
of information to leave out.

28:16.821 --> 28:20.199
And what about the fishheads?
Will it cook them, too?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.534
Unfortunately not.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.412
The Espheni have biologically
engineered themselves

28:24.578 --> 28:26.831
and their harnessed slaves
to fully withstand

28:26.997 --> 28:28.874
the effects of the radiation.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.629
I conveyed all this information
to Professor Mason,

28:33.796 --> 28:37.383
and he agreed it would only
create undue panic and worry

28:37.550 --> 28:39.927
to reveal it
to the general population.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.304
And I agreed when Cochise
told me, as well.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.974
Therefore, Ms. Peralta,

28:45.141 --> 28:48.477
the excess power
Dr. Kadar identified

28:48.644 --> 28:52.064
is actually to destroy the grid
by feeding an enormous

28:52.231 --> 28:55.735
energy burst back into the grid,
causing it to overload.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.028
And this couldn't have been
explained to me in the first place?

28:58.195 --> 29:00.281
There is great risk involved.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.366
If the grid is not destroyed,

29:02.533 --> 29:04.493
feeding that much power
back into it

29:04.660 --> 29:06.704
could accelerate the process.

29:07.663 --> 29:11.625
Life as you know it on
this planet will cease to exist.

Well, I'm a little booked up today,

29:34.440 --> 29:36.942
but I think I'll make
an exception for you.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.279
Boy, the state of the union
must be in complete turmoil

29:40.446 --> 29:41.614

all the way down here

29:41.781 --> 29:43.824

29:48.788 --> 29:50.664
When I wanted to throw you out
on your ear,

29:50.873 --> 29:53.167
Tom convinced me
that having someone

29:53.375 --> 29:56.504
who doesn't do the acceptable
thing can be essential.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.632
We might be headed
for a time when that's true.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.469
And here I figured that you
and our ersatz president

30:03.636 --> 30:05.638
had it all figured out.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.807
A little trouble

I might need your help, Pope.

Need my help?

You shut me down.

You put me out of business.

You locked me up.

Something's going down where
none of that's gonna matter, Pope.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.752
You might be right
about the Volm.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.712
Is that it?

30:39.463 --> 30:41.006
That's all you're gonna give me?

30:41.173 --> 30:43.133
Till you need to know more.

30:45.427 --> 30:46.971
Now, get out of here.

- What kind of stuff?
- Can't exactly say.

Meaning you don't know.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.762
No, but the source
is unimpeachable.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.431
So why are you telling me?

31:30.639 --> 31:34.518
Just figured without the Mason brood
around, you might just need a friend.

The way I remember it is
I rescued you from near death.

You kidnapped me
and fed me to your gang.

was say something,

36:42.492 --> 36:45.370
The shooter was in the room
