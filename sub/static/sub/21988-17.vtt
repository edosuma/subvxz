WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:10.378
Are you sure
I can't make you a sandwich?

00:10.411 --> 00:12.546
Uh, nope. I'm good.
Thanks, Doc.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.449
Well, I appreciate you
working late, Kasie,

00:15.483 --> 00:19.420
but you do know we could
resume early in the morning.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.255
Uh, nope, we can't.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.292
Not with your
deadline a week away.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.626
That is, unless you're cool
with me making

00:25.659 --> 00:27.361
editorial choices on my own.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.530
Uh, otherwise, I
recommend you turn off

00:29.563 --> 00:32.733
that procrastinator's dream show
and focus over here, please.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.236
It's got a little bit of damage.
Y-You've had it for a while.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.239
You can see one of the spikes
is missing here.
WOMAN: Well, it's real old.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.208
MAN: No, but, I mean,
that doesn't distract at all

00:40.241 --> 00:41.375
from the value,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.576
Well...
I mean, it's just...

00:42.610 --> 00:44.245
It's just part of its story.
WOMAN: Right.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.646
Right, right, right. Yeah.
MAN: Wow.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.548
WOMAN: I know. I like to just
think of all the people

00:47.581 --> 00:49.283
that have held that.
Can I make you an offer?

00:49.317 --> 00:50.818
No. No, it's not for sale.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.786
I don't think so.
GIBBS: Hey, Duck.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.256
Jethro, tell me you're watching.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.158
I never miss this show.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.293
DUCKY:
I mean, is it possible?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.629
After all these years?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.331
How fast can you get down here?

01:07.335 --> 01:09.337
*

01:44.305 --> 01:45.706
Ah, take it yours
is busted again?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.508
Ah. Mine, too.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.876
Top government agency,

01:48.909 --> 01:51.212
and we have one
working stapler between us?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.352
Uh, make that no staplers,
because this one is busted, too.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.389
Maybe it's just empty.
Maybe it's just jammed.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.190
Ooh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:02.223 --> 02:04.258
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.759
You're gonna break it.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.661
And here are the
hardest-working special agents

02:07.695 --> 02:09.797
in law enforcement.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.332
Oh, welcome back, Ducky.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.666
Eleanor, allow me
to introduce

02:12.700 --> 02:15.436
Kasie Hines,
my graduate assistant.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.737
Kasie, this is...

02:16.770 --> 02:17.871
Wait, don't tell me.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.708
"Eleanor" would make
you Agent Bishop,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.811
and you look more like an
Agent McGee than a Torres,

02:23.844 --> 02:26.614
which would make you
Agent Torres.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.682
Damn it, I don't
look like a McGee?
Ah, well.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.185
Kind of look like a McGee
with a tan, maybe.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.621
Kasie insisted on
accompanying me.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.822
Like I had a choice.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.591
Publisher's expecting his
first five chapters on Monday,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.293
and we're nowhere close.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.461
Oh, we're not that far.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.731
I-I hired Kasie to
keep me on schedule.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.267
Little did I know she
would be so, uh...

02:46.300 --> 02:48.269
emphatic.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.705
And I'll be emphatically furious
if you miss your deadline.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.307
We still have a ton

02:53.341 --> 02:54.742
of notes to transcribe.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.610
Plus, his chapter
on unsolved cases

02:56.644 --> 03:00.281
will need a big rewrite if
this Flintstones thing pays off.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.316
Flintstones?
McGEE: Yeah, Gibbs called me

03:02.350 --> 03:03.984
about it last night,
and I must say,

03:04.017 --> 03:06.854
this thing
looks very Flintstones.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.823
What the hell
is that thing?

03:09.857 --> 03:13.294
DUCKY: It's a ceremonial
Viking war stick.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.863
It was adopted by an obscure
fraternal organization

03:15.896 --> 03:17.565
back in the 1800s.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.766
McGEE: Gibbs and
Ducky think it's also

03:18.799 --> 03:20.634
the missing weapon
to an unsolved case.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.903
16 years ago, I pulled
a single wooden spike

03:22.936 --> 03:25.939
from the skull of a
young petty officer.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.908
You never traced it
to a weapon?
No.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.977
No, not until just now.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.748
And you have
got to be Jethro!

03:34.782 --> 03:37.251
Hi!

03:38.552 --> 03:39.720
Hello.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.588
Yeah, Kasie's work
on my book

03:40.621 --> 03:42.856
has made her very familiar
with the team.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.826
Perhaps a little
too familiar.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.794
It's-it's an honor, really.
I mean,

03:46.827 --> 03:49.530
Doc is writing some
great stuff about you.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.864
Okay.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.933
Yeah. Okay.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.067
Uh, McGee.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.771
Yeah, boss. Um, well, as you saw
on the show last night,

03:57.805 --> 04:00.508
the woman chose not to sell
the item in question.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.975
WOMAN : Yeah.
MAN: $3,000.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.944
No. You know what?
Three grand's
a lot of moola, honey.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.413
Tell you what.
It's not for sale.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.814
It's worth way more
than that, anyway.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.048
I know it.
TORRES:
What?!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.284
More than $3,000
for a piece of wood?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.853
Boss, I dug up the lady's
address in southern Maryland.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.822
Okay. Duck, let's go.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.924
Bishop, you, too.
KASIE:
Oh, man.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.826
He does move fast.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
BISHOP:
So much junk,

04:22.363 --> 04:23.964
so little time.

04:23.997 --> 04:28.936
DUCKY: Junk, my dear Ellie,
is in the eye of the beholder.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.938
As are most treasures.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.813
What the hell

04:39.847 --> 04:42.082
are you doing in here?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.952
Oh, o-our sincerest apologies,
Mrs. Keogh.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.354
Yeah, we're with NCIS,
Mrs. Keogh.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.822
How much you want for this?

04:48.856 --> 04:49.857
Seriously, Gibbs?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.626
Take a buck for it.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.963
Ah, it's worth more than that.
I'll give you five.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.331
Sorry.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.467
Ever since that show
aired last night,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.935
we've been besieged with
more crazy collectors.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.872
You wouldn't believe the offers
we got for that damn war stick.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.875
Speaking of which,
I don't see it here,

05:07.908 --> 05:10.978
where it was mounted
on the show.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.380
Don't have it anymore.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.448
Show was shot,
what, three months ago?

05:14.482 --> 05:15.883
Couple weeks later,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.951
my husband talked me
into taking Mike's offer.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.787
So the Pickers have it now.
They do.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.789
For a hell of a lot less
than we've been offered today,

05:21.822 --> 05:24.792
I can tell you.
Well, Mrs. Keogh,
how did you acquire it?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.627
Tracing its provenance,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.763
why, it just might
lead us sooner to our killer.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.998
Your killer?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.100
We're investigating a murder.
Old one.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.003
And you think that stick...?

05:36.036 --> 05:39.507
Oh, no, I-I can't imagine
that nice young fella

05:39.540 --> 05:41.509
that sold it to me
would be capable.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.077
So, does that nice young fella
have a name?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.146
Earl.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.815
Earl something.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.883
Or Fred.

05:49.917 --> 05:54.054
Paid him $2,500 at a flea market
about ten years ago.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.591
I'm sure I've got
his card here somewhere.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.026
Why?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.128
MRS. KEOGH:
Why What, Georgie?

06:01.161 --> 06:03.764
Why did I ever
talk you into selling

06:03.797 --> 06:05.499
for so damn little?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.934
DUCKY: With all
due respect, Mr. Keogh,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.503
$3,000 is a decent price.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.704
The call we just got.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.674
The offer-- man, it
was a knee buckler.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.175
Cranky son of a gun
just offered us

06:15.208 --> 06:17.511
25,000.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.311
Dollars?

06:18.345 --> 06:20.548
Who was that?
Oh, I don't know.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.617
Guy didn't believe me at first
when I told him we sold it.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.085
Then he got all mad,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.521
cursing and hollering
before he hung up on me.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.856
DUCKY:
Dare I say

06:28.889 --> 06:30.758
that someone that
eager and angry...

06:30.791 --> 06:32.392
Might just know something.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.971
It's really no different

06:44.004 --> 06:46.840
from one of those sorority
or fraternity paddles.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.642
Purely ceremonial.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.811
Uh, a symbol, a totem.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.713
And very good
luck, supposedly.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.515
Right. A talisman.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.083
These groups love
that kind of thing.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.685
You know much about this?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.587
Esteemed Order
of the Blue Guard?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.222
No, but these groups
have been around forever.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.458
Knights of Columbus,

07:04.492 --> 07:06.193
the Freemasons, Rotary Club.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.562
Let's not forget about
the International Brotherhood

07:08.596 --> 07:10.598
of Loyal Raccoons.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.201
Honeymooners?
No

07:14.234 --> 07:16.704
Collectors have a
community all their own.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.772
To them, the value

07:18.806 --> 07:20.574
isn't in the chunk
of wood itself.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.476
It's what it means
to whoever wants it.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.579
So what does it mean to the guy
who offered $25,000?

07:25.613 --> 07:26.780
BISHOP:
Well, for that much,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.716
it has to mean getting
away with murder.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.784
McGEE: We traced the
call to a burn phone,

07:30.818 --> 07:33.987
which makes Mr. $25,000
even more suspicious.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.322
BISHOP: And Mrs. Keogh
is still looking

07:35.355 --> 07:38.492
for the card of Earl something,
the guy who sold her the stick.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.160
I left a message for Danielle

07:40.193 --> 07:41.629
at the Pickers'
headquarters in Iowa.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.497
She should be getting back to me
anytime soon.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.166
So, who did this thing
kill, exactly?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.334
What was the case?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.637
Happened a long time ago,
before any of you were here.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.972
Young petty officer.
BISHOP: Marvin Finn.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.174
Was found dead with
blunt force wounds

07:54.207 --> 07:56.544
in an alley in
Columbia Heights.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.512
It was a bad neighborhood
in 2002.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.980
McGEE:
A small wooden spike

08:00.013 --> 08:01.549
was left embedded
in Finn's skull,

08:01.582 --> 08:03.617
but neither Ducky or Abby
could ever link it

08:03.651 --> 08:04.985
to a weapon or killer.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.520
BISHOP: The last two
people to see Finn alive

08:06.554 --> 08:09.523
were his girlfriend Jane
and his best friend Bill.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.659
Lack of evidence or a motive
made them weak suspects at best.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.660
TORRES:
Could Finn

08:12.693 --> 08:13.927
be somehow connected

08:13.961 --> 08:15.696
to this Esteemed Order
of Raccoons

08:15.729 --> 08:17.097
or whatevers?
BISHOP: Doubtful.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.532
I mean,
the last surviving members

08:18.566 --> 08:20.834
of the Blue Guard
died off in the 1960s.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.002
SLOANE:
Yes, but could Finn

08:22.035 --> 08:23.637
maybe be a descendant?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.238
Grandfathered in somehow?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.774
All right, there's
a loose connection somewhere.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.042
Keep digging. Come on. Find it.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.611
JIMMY:
Yeah, took a while to find it.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.012
You know, our evidence storage

08:32.045 --> 08:34.014
is like one big old
museum of murder.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
Hard to believe
something that small

08:35.683 --> 08:37.217
could cause
so much damage.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.619
JIMMY:
Yeah.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.187
I know, right?

08:40.220 --> 08:43.056
KASIE: Oh, kind of took over
your desk, didn't I?

08:43.090 --> 08:45.593
Oh, no, no, no.
Kasie, it-it's fine. It's fine.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.595
If you recall
from my notes, Kasie,

08:47.628 --> 08:49.963
it was the blunt force injury
from the stick

08:49.997 --> 08:53.567
that killed Petty Officer Finn
and not this spike.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.102
A spike which, frankly,
is a lot larger

08:55.135 --> 08:56.336
than some of the evidence
we collect.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.205
I mean, most of it's
microscopic.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.107
Microscopic?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.109
That's where I come in,
literally.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.144
Abby, you heard
the good news.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.979
The great news.
And I can't believe it,

09:06.013 --> 09:07.948
after all these years.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.818
And you must be Kasie.
I'm Abby.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.687
Hey. Hey, hi.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.988
Hi.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.657
Uh, so, rumor has it

09:16.690 --> 09:18.959
you're working wonders
with Ducky's book.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.360
Trying.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.461
DUCKY:
Oh, that-that reminds me.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.297
Would it be possible
for Kasie to stay at your place

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
for a couple of days?
KASIE: What? Doc, no.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.701
I already got a motel

09:27.735 --> 09:29.803
and would probably
get more done there, anyway.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.972
Nuh-uh. No motel.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.641
You are staying with me, lady.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.342
No if, ands, or buts.
But...

09:36.376 --> 09:37.811
Okay.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.012
Aha.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.714
You miss me?

09:40.748 --> 09:43.216
Little bugger.
I knew we'd see you again.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.185
I wish I had
your optimism, Abby,

09:45.218 --> 09:47.387
but it seemed
this case was destined

09:47.420 --> 09:49.189
to be stuck in my craw

09:49.222 --> 09:50.691
for the rest of my days.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.693
This one really had
you all stumped, huh?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.095
Carbon dating I.D.'d this
as 900-year-old hickory.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.098
And after that, yeah,
"stumped" would be the word.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.700
Well, not anymore.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.669
I mean, this-this one
is a total match, right?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.737
Yeah, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.640
Until we have
the actual war stick in hand,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.709
we won't know for certain.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.644
No counting our chickens, Jimmy.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
I'm totally
counting my chickens.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.256
What is that?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.692
Oh, this?

10:24.725 --> 10:27.661
This, my friend,
is my new stapler.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.662
Oh, that thing is new?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.197
BISHOP:
Well, it's new to me.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.765
Feel the weight of it.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.767
It's like a...
like a Mack truck.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.136
They just don't make 'em
like that anymore.
Yeah.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.971
Yeah.
Does this thing even work?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.774
Oh, it works.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.710
Listen to this.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.249
Oh, yeah!
Mm-hmm.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.753
Yeah, you know, I had no idea

10:52.786 --> 10:55.022
what kind
of priceless old relics

10:55.055 --> 10:57.124
you can find at these places.
Hmm.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.859
How much you pay for that?
Eight dollars.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.761
Ooh, priceless.
McGEE: All right, thanks.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.129
Okay, that was Danielle

11:02.162 --> 11:04.131
at the American Pickers' base
in Iowa.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.299
What
No, she called us,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.769
but unlike you,
I spend time at my desk.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.137
Okay, can we not start
with that again?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.839
Anyway, Danielle said
that Mike Wolfe

11:11.872 --> 11:13.173
is at a convention
somewhere in Annandale,

11:13.206 --> 11:15.142
and he's got
the war stick with him.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.910
I'll call Gibbs
to meet us there.
Oh, no, no.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.813
Allow us to call him
to meet us there.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.715
Just spend a little more time
on your desk.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.451
Yeah, you take it easy
and you send us the address.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.854
You don't have to tell me that.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.789
I got it.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.490
MIKE: All right,
here's the deal, guys.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.060
I have absolutely no interest
in selling this piece,

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
because it's just been
too lucky for us.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.229
GIBBS:
Lucky how?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.198
Well, Nordic sailors believed

11:38.231 --> 11:41.068
this piece had mystical powers
way before the Blue Guard

11:41.101 --> 11:43.771
ever claimed it as their own,
and since I've had this,

11:43.804 --> 11:47.007
Frank and I have had some
incredible luck finding things.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.077
And I'm just not willing
to break up that mojo yet.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.945
We're gonna have
to break it for you,

11:51.979 --> 11:53.781
since, uh, this stick
wasn't very lucky

11:53.814 --> 11:55.515
for somebody 16 years ago.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.285
Yeah, my office called and said
that you guys really believe

11:58.318 --> 12:01.421
that somebody was killed
with this thing.
Only one way to find out.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.124
Just please tell me we can
get this back if you're wrong,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.093
'cause Danny's gonna
be heartbroken.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.861
Tell Danny
she doesn't have to worry.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.797
We'll get this back to you as
soon as we're finished with it.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.264
Wow.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.935
Wow. This is...
This is a stick, all right.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.503
It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.505
Why would someone keep it
after killing somebody?

12:18.538 --> 12:21.474
I mean, this is evidence.
I would toss it, burn it, right?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.943
MIKE:
My guess is

12:22.976 --> 12:24.845
somebody knew it had value.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.279
Does that make
that someone a collector?

12:26.313 --> 12:28.148
You know, collectors
are eccentric people,

12:28.181 --> 12:30.150
but I've never
heard of anybody

12:30.183 --> 12:32.319
getting killed
over a collectible.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.121
BISHOP:
Well, Mrs. Keogh

12:34.154 --> 12:37.124
finally found the card of the
guy who sold her the stick.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.526
Earl something's name
is actually Roy Baxter.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.494
Roy?
You know him?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.831
Of course. If you're in my
business, you know who Roy is.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.165
This is a guy
that's been buying

12:45.198 --> 12:46.466
and selling for years
at flea markets,

12:46.499 --> 12:47.868
worked his way up

12:47.901 --> 12:49.536
to an antique shop
in Falls Church.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.039
Deals in anything
from typewriters to teakettles.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.541
Well, McGee's getting
his address now.
GIBBS: Yeah, go meet him.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.044
Torres and I will take this
to Abby; she can look at it.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.447
All right. Hey, let me say...
let me say good-bye to my baby.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.815
I mean, I've got
history with this piece.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.250
I've had it for a while,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.418
and we spent some time
together, me and you.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.321
Please tell me that you
didn't kill somebody.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.590
It's been real.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.860
TORRES: Well, that was...

13:12.893 --> 13:14.962
That was a nice good-bye.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.264
Thanks, Mike.
Appreciate you.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.500
Like the show.
Thank you.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.434
McGEE: Just got
to the antique shop, boss.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.570
Haven't been able
to get ahold of the owner.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.305
We'll let you know
what we find.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.975
Who closes up
and leaves the lights on?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.844
There's got to be a back door.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.880
Yup, it's open.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.450
Hello

13:37.484 --> 13:39.619
NCIS.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.158
Hey, Bishop?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.498
Think we found Baxter.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.116
All right, Ducky and
Jimmy are on their way.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.185
So Baxter locked the front
door, came out the back.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.321
Dumped the trash.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.189
He got ambushed.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.225
McGEE: Beaten to death
with a broken table leg.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.193
Quite a way to go.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.130
Money's still in the register,
but there's no way of telling

14:23.163 --> 14:24.998
if any of the antiques
have been taken.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.133
Security cameras?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.167
Nope. None back here.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.669
There's one inside, but
it's a really old model.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.205
What I did find was
Baxter's appointment book.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.142
There's a few names
in there from today.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.211
Could one of them have sold
Baxter the war stick years ago?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.213
BISHOP: Well, if so,
he obviously didn't want

14:40.247 --> 14:41.414
Baxter telling anyone.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.296
Ah. Is that the
antiques dealer?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.932
Yeah.
Horrible.

14:58.966 --> 15:02.069
Do you think it's the same
killer from 16 years ago?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.403
Blunt force
with the Viking war stick,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.305
and now a broken table leg.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.375
If it's not the same guy, they
at least share a signature move.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.111
Yes, bashing people to death
is quite a signature.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.247
I didn't say it
was a good one.
What about the stick?

15:14.281 --> 15:16.149
You satisfied
it's a match?
DUCKY: Quite.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.218
It's looks to me as
if stick and spike

15:18.251 --> 15:21.288
go together like two pieces
of a puzzle.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.156
So help me, if there is
any evidence on this thing,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.491
I will find it.
JIMMY:
Yeah, the broken table leg

15:24.524 --> 15:26.426
was already sent up
to your lab, Abby.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.228
You'll find the evidence
a lot fresher.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.263
Well, that means
I have a full day.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.564
Let's go, Kasie.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.134
Me
To my lab.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.136
Doesn't look like you're gonna
get much done down here.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.604
DUCKY:
Uh, she's right, Kasie.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.307
You need the minimum
of distraction.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.476
Uh, let me help you.
Are you coming, Abigail?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.179
Um, you know what?
Uh, you guys go ahead,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.381
and I'll meet you up there
in a few minutes.

15:50.717 --> 15:54.287
So... you two hit it off?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.390
Not quite yet.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.259
Do you think Kasie's okay?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.261
Okay? No, no, she's-she's great.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.396
I mean, a little bit messy,

16:03.430 --> 16:05.398
maybe a tad pushy
at first, but...

16:05.432 --> 16:06.566
And shy.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.535
Shy? No, not exactly.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.271
In fact, I'd say she's got
just the right amount of moxie

16:11.304 --> 16:13.373
to push Dr. Mallard
across the finish line.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.675
Moxie?
Moxie! My grandpa's
favorite word.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.677
Well, I saw no moxie

16:17.710 --> 16:19.579
when she stayed at my place
last night.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.082
She barely even spoke to me.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.252
By any chance, did you have
her sleep in your guest casket?

16:25.285 --> 16:28.255
I don't have a guest casket.
I have a guest room, in which

16:28.288 --> 16:31.191
she promptly shut the door to
and worked all night long.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.160
And from that you get shy?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.227
What else would it be?

16:34.261 --> 16:37.464
I don't know, scared,
apprehensive, intimidated?

16:37.497 --> 16:40.700
By me

16:40.733 --> 16:43.436
Jimmy, please. Like
that's even possible.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.139
I'll win her over.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.375
As only you can.
That's right.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.478
As only... I...

16:53.480 --> 16:55.348
Intimidated?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.352
TORRES:
You've got to be kidding me.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.787
BISHOP:
Figures.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.223
Antique shop with an
antique surveillance system.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.658
McGEE: Yeah, a broken
antique surveillance system.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.295
The camera's supposed to take
a photo every five seconds.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.829
This is closer to 15.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.165
It's all we got.
Click faster.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.633
TORRES:
Who is that guy?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.235
BISHOP: Ooh. Well,
doesn't seem too friendly.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.070
McGEE: Oh, make that
downright hostile.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.239
You got a name, Nick?
Yeah, Baxter's last appointment

17:19.272 --> 17:21.574
was at 6:30 p.m.
Clarence Wyatt.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.476
Oh.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.312
BISHOP: Well,
somehow I don't think

17:25.345 --> 17:29.282
this was an appointment kind
of meeting. And he's gone.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.817
There's no Clarence Wyatts
in Falls Church,

17:30.850 --> 17:34.121
but I got one in D.C.
Bishop, Torres, go.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.324
Uh, McGee, send us the address?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.326
Okay, you really got
to stop telling me that.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.860
McGee, send a picture
of him, too.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.363
You got it, boss.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.434
Whoa! Hey, Jethro.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.202
Oh, Agent Gibbs. Sorry.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.138
Am I lost?
It depends.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.605
You're looking
for Autopsy?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.274
No. Abby's lab.
I moved.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.775
One floor down,
and you're there.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.644
Hmm.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.646
Hmm.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.348
Yeah.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.219
Why Abby's lab?

18:06.253 --> 18:09.122
Doc and Jimmy were about to
autopsy that antique dealer.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.358
Not my thing.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.360
First dead body?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.794
No, I-I've seen one before.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.367
Anyway, long story.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.801
Too long.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.137
I was told not to
waste your time.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.373
Who told you that?
Everybody.

18:31.378 --> 18:34.314
The same everybody
who said you sometimes leave

18:34.347 --> 18:36.316
without saying good-bye.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.185
No. No, no, no.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.719
WYATT: Yeah. Sure,
that's me. So what?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.388
What's this about?

18:41.421 --> 18:44.224
Mm, maybe it's about this
gun you're waving around?

18:44.257 --> 18:45.758
You mean the gun
I was purchasing?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.427
Uh-uh.
Whoa.
Oh, chill.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.761
It's not loaded.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.798
Probably hasn't been
since Patton fired it.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.167
Patton as in...
General George Patton?

18:54.201 --> 18:56.536
Yeah, this is one of his beloved
pearl-handled Colts.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.939
And a nice complement
to my Churchill whiskey glass,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.809
my FDR cigarette holder,

19:02.842 --> 19:06.546
my Jackie Robinson mitt.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.482
This stuff reminds me
of my roots, you know?

19:09.516 --> 19:12.452
Keeps me humble.
Plus, my clients love it.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.753
Here's a silly question.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.455
If you bought
that from Baxter,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.957
why was he so unhappy afterward?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.360
Like any self-respecting
financial genius,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.529
I talked him down.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.797
And as far as I know,
I still overpaid.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.500
Ask him.
Only Baxter knows for sure.

19:27.534 --> 19:31.404
Well, we would,
except Baxter's dead.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.806
Dead? I just saw him.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.508
They jumped him in the alley
after closing.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.909
Beat him to death.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.412
That's terrible.
BISHOP:
It is.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.781
You were one of
his last customers.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.850
Did you see anything suspicious?

19:43.883 --> 19:47.387
I wish I had.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.423
That neighborhood, I tell you.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.425
Such a good guy.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.628
Let me know if I can help
in any way down the road.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.368
And yes, that is titanium.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.602
BISHOP:
Actually, you can.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.238
You know anything about this?
What is it?

20:05.272 --> 20:07.540
Some kind of a cavemen thing?
A movie prop?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.442
TORRES:
Something like that. Say...

20:09.476 --> 20:12.011
is that something
you would pay 25 grand for?
25?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.613
No. Maybe if it was swung

20:13.646 --> 20:16.015
by Raquel Welch
in One Million Years B.C.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
Even then, I'd only
give it a-a grand maybe.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.522
Otherwise, it's just
an ugly chunk of wood.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.491
Thank you.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.726
My sentiments exactly.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.362
Thanks.
No problem.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.431
SLOANE: I just wanted
to see it in person.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.500
It's not the prettiest
good

20:33.533 --> 20:36.636
I prefer horseshoes
or ladybugs.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.970
Any update on the case?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.472
No game-changers yet.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.974
I'm still waiting
on Major Mass Spec.
Oh.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.511
Excuse me.
Uh, I know it's not my place,

20:44.544 --> 20:46.479
but may I ask a question?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.615
Absolutely, yes.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.783
KASIE: I'm sure you've
researched all of this already,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.752
but out of curiosity,
I DM'd my network

20:52.785 --> 20:54.587
about this
Order of the Blue Guard.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.590
And my girl Cheryl in Tucson--
she's an anthropologist--

20:57.624 --> 20:59.326
and she went over to the library

20:59.359 --> 21:01.561
and scanned over
the most amazing book to me.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.896
That's an amazing friend.
Oh, I'm blessed
with a lot of them.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.599
Well, did you know
that an actual exhibit

21:06.633 --> 21:08.501
of Blue Guard stuff
made the museum rounds

21:08.535 --> 21:10.603
for years after they folded up?

21:10.637 --> 21:13.906
Stuff including
the "one-of-a-kind" war stick.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.509
Their words, not mine.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.944
Where was the
exhibit's last stop?

21:17.977 --> 21:21.648
Doesn't say, but when
the tour ended in 1983,

21:21.681 --> 21:24.784
the collection went into a
private museum storage facility

21:24.817 --> 21:26.619
in Fairfax, Virginia.
ABBY: Wait.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.088
So you're saying the Viking
war stick is in storage?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.757
I'm not saying it.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.826
The American Registry
of Fraternal Organizations is.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.662
They even have pictures.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.498
SLOANE: So, if this
one-of-a-kind Viking war stick

21:38.531 --> 21:40.600
is in storage...?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.002
Then why is it
right there?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.740
Welcome to Row 613.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.577
I really should get
down here more.

21:50.610 --> 21:54.447
Crate 92 holds the
Blue Guard exhibit.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.390
Whoa. Where to begin?

22:03.423 --> 22:05.057
Or we could just start
with the one

22:05.091 --> 22:06.659
that says "Viking war stick."

22:14.534 --> 22:16.536
Huh. Nothing.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.637
Excuse me?

22:17.670 --> 22:18.905
It's empty.
There's nothing in it.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.872
How can that be?

22:19.906 --> 22:21.808
At least now we know
we have the real thing.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.943
I see security cameras.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.912
WOMAN: They only store
up to six months.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.648
Hey, what do you
make of this?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.152
It's blood spatter.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.489
BISHOP:
Looks more black than red.
It's old blood.

22:36.523 --> 22:40.126
Guessing about
16 years old.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.763
Which makes this
the original scene of the crime.

22:56.976 --> 23:00.447
Is your Mack truck available?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.849
Sure, just let me
back her out of the garage.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.417
ABBY:
Hey, guys,

23:04.451 --> 23:05.718
where's Gibbs?
TORRES: Conference room.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.920
He's with Petty Officer Finn's
old girlfriend.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.121
Why

23:09.155 --> 23:11.090
The blood...

23:11.123 --> 23:12.191
No.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.093
No, no, no!

23:14.126 --> 23:16.796
Don't tell me...

23:16.829 --> 23:18.798
Really? You killed
another one?

23:18.831 --> 23:19.899
Me?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.968
They're your papers.
You're a jinx.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.936
Don't blame my papers.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.905
You were saying?

23:25.938 --> 23:27.139
How do you open this thing?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.841
The blood spatter samples
that you found

23:28.875 --> 23:30.777
at the storage facility,
they were a match

23:30.810 --> 23:32.945
to Petty Officer Finn.
Oh, yeah. We figured.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.647
How did Finn's body
end up miles away?

23:34.681 --> 23:35.982
Well, the storage facility's
big enough

23:36.015 --> 23:37.650
to drive a car or van into,

23:37.684 --> 23:39.486
so getting a body out
wouldn't be that hard,

23:39.519 --> 23:40.553
unlike this stupid...

23:40.587 --> 23:42.489
Oh. Oh.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.156
Just...
It just needed staples.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.560
So, if I recall,

23:47.594 --> 23:50.229
the last two people
to see Finn alive

23:50.262 --> 23:52.231
never mentioned
a storage facility.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.701
I mean, didn't they know
he was going there?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.203
I'm gonna check on that
with Gibbs.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.705
Yeah, and I'll
check with McGee

23:58.738 --> 24:00.507
and see if he needs help
tracking down

24:00.540 --> 24:01.841
Finn's buddy Bill.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.843
Hey. I was just
coming to see you.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.045
Oh, really?
'Cause you were my next stop.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.147
Well, it was meant
to be. You first. Go.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.517
Um, lollipops.
Can I borrow some?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.719
Always. Come.
Whatever you want.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.920
Okay, your turn.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.222
Well, I just wanted
to check in on you.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.225
You seemed a little--
I don't know-- off before.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.193
Maybe something
to do with Kasie?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.895
It is about Kasie.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.064
And I'm more than
a little off.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.034
Why? She seems
so smart and sweet.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.169
She does not like me.
What?

24:30.202 --> 24:32.872
She doesn't talk to me,
she doesn't look at me.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.073
You couldn't tell?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.875
No, not at all.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.078
Nor can I imagine
anyone not liking you, Abby.

24:39.111 --> 24:42.014
Everybody doesn't
just click right away.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.015
I do.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.851
I click.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.819
And so does she.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.556
She has a network, Jack.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.057
Like, a whole collection

24:51.090 --> 24:53.059
of amazing friends
that do stuff like

24:53.092 --> 24:54.727
scan books for her.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.863
I mean, does that sound
like someone who doesn't click?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.698
Just give her another shot.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.700
Oh, I intend to.
Lollipops.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.035
Oh, I see. The lollipops,
they're for Kasie.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.172
Yeah. I mean, maybe I didn't
give her a proper welcome.

25:06.205 --> 25:10.009
I'm gonna help you pick out
the exact right color for her.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.911
JANE:
Look at us.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.046
Oh, we were babies.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.583
All these years later
and I've never quite shaken

25:16.616 --> 25:18.651
this sick feeling
since Finn was killed.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.553
Something you never get over.

25:20.587 --> 25:24.657
Finn never mentioned this...
museum storage place to you?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.993
Never. Are you sure it was
his blood you found there?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.194
Yeah.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.629
We are now.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.965
God, Finn hardly went
to museums,

25:32.999 --> 25:35.167
let alone a place like that.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.303
Have your original statement.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.938
Wasn't much to it.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.940
Finn went out to meet
his buddy Bill for a beer.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.842
Bill was always having
girl trouble.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.111
And the next time I saw Finn

25:45.144 --> 25:47.780
was on one of your autopsy
tables downstairs.

25:47.814 --> 25:52.785
His buddy Bill said they
parted ways at 10:00 p.m.,

25:52.819 --> 25:55.622
after their beer.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.157
What does Bill say now?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.828
What's the deal?
Why the hot seat?

26:01.861 --> 26:03.996
Not your first interrogation,
Mr. Lester?

26:04.030 --> 26:06.766
You said this was about
Finn, and I came willingly.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.936
I want nothing more than
to have this burden lifted.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.938
The guilt I carry
around my whole life.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.773
Guilt?

26:13.806 --> 26:16.976
Yeah, thinking if only
I'd seen Finn home safely,

26:17.009 --> 26:19.946
stayed with him
after we had that beer.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.314
TORRES:
That beer. Where was that again?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.883
BILL:
Place isn't there anymore.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.718
Look, what is this?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.820
You guys said that
you had some new developments.

26:27.854 --> 26:28.755
We do.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.857
We contacted your
old base, and it seems

26:30.890 --> 26:33.092
your buddy Finn was off-duty
the night he died,

26:33.125 --> 26:35.995
while you were somehow listed
as very much on-duty.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.064
They said that?

26:38.097 --> 26:41.133
Yes, they did.
You even drew a special detail.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.369
Delivering artifacts
from the Naval Academy Museum

26:43.402 --> 26:46.105
in Annapolis to a museum
storage facility in Fairfax.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.740
TORRES:
The same facility

26:47.774 --> 26:50.710
we just found Finn's blood.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.713
Wait, what?

26:53.746 --> 26:55.414
You... you found his blood?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.016
Yeah, and that
makes no sense,

26:57.049 --> 26:58.985
'cause how could you meet Finn
for a beer

26:59.018 --> 27:01.721
and be on duty that night,
making a delivery,

27:01.754 --> 27:03.990
all at the same damn time?

27:04.023 --> 27:05.658
Look...

27:11.931 --> 27:13.933
I'm sorry.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.805
I'm so sorry.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.272
What are you
so sorry about?

27:22.008 --> 27:25.244
I didn't kill him, okay?

27:25.277 --> 27:28.014
But I didn't meet him
for a beer either.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.682
Okay. What did you do?

27:29.716 --> 27:32.852
I asked Finny to cover my shift,
so I could see my girl.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.921
It was the only night
she could see me.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.455
Why didn't you say that
16 years ago?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.758
For the same reason Finn
didn't tell his girlfriend Jane

27:38.791 --> 27:40.159
where he was really going.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.061
You know? To protect me.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.129
Protect you from what?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.464
The girl I was seeing...

27:47.233 --> 27:50.069
She was our C.O.'s wife.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.139
If I told the truth
about that and it got out,

27:53.172 --> 27:55.141
it would ruin her life
and my life

27:55.174 --> 27:58.210
and, God, our C.O.'s life...

27:58.244 --> 27:59.746
Like it ended Finn's life?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.180
I didn't see
any possible connection.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.015
The-the delivery
was in Fairfax.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.851
Finn was found in
Columbia Heights.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.219
I mean, those two places
are light-years apart.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.220
About 20 miles.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.190
Look, please,

28:11.223 --> 28:14.226
believe me.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.296
You say Finn's... blood
was at the storage place?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.901
If I'd have known that,
I-I would've told the truth.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.036
I swear I would've.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.072
McGEE: All right,
you want to make up for it?

28:26.105 --> 28:27.874
You tell us everything
that you know

28:27.907 --> 28:29.275
about this delivery detail.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.877
Who else was on it?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.812
Look, all I remember
is my orders were

28:32.845 --> 28:35.247
to transport stuff
from the Navy Museum.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.284
And that I'd be picked up
by a guy delivering other stuff

28:38.317 --> 28:41.854
from a museum in Philly,
uh, Reconnaissance Hall?

28:41.888 --> 28:43.189
What guy?
Some guy.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.457
I don't know. A civilian.

28:45.491 --> 28:48.861
Uh, again, I-I wasn't there.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.997
Finn was.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.834
Damn fool.
Why didn't he tell us?

28:54.867 --> 28:56.335
Have we got our killer?

28:56.368 --> 28:58.170
No. Just a liar.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.372
Oh. Okay. Well,
in that case,

29:00.406 --> 29:03.309
how much do you guys know
about antique firearms?

29:03.342 --> 29:04.877
That would depend.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.212
What do we got?
Not us.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.881
That obnoxious billionaire,
Clarence Wyatt.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.516
Guy with
Patton's pearl

29:10.549 --> 29:14.053
So, we dug up the receipts
from the antique shop

29:14.086 --> 29:15.855
the night Baxter was killed.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.190
Wyatt paid $15,000.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.927
Doesn't that sound
like an awful lot?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.394
GIBBS: Not if it
once belonged to Patton.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.097
Well, that provenance
would indeed raise the price.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.999
That is where
it gets weird.

29:27.033 --> 29:30.202
Gets weird?
Now it gets weird?

29:30.236 --> 29:32.404
BISHOP: So, Baxter's catalog
lists it only

29:32.438 --> 29:34.240
as a World War Two-era
Colt revolver.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.175
Not one word
about Patton.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.178
Which is not the sort of detail
you leave out.

29:39.211 --> 29:42.281
So either Baxter lied
to Wyatt about the Colt

29:42.314 --> 29:44.917
or Wyatt lied
to us about it.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.285
Why would he do that?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.897
Yeah, you're quite right, Kasie.

29:57.930 --> 30:01.133
This chapter will now require
a complete rewrite.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.969
Well, I never said
"complete," Doc.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.071
We-we don't have time
for complete.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.573
Besides, you write
about two other unsolved cases

30:07.606 --> 30:10.042
in that chapter,
and that's plenty.

30:10.076 --> 30:14.446
Yeah, but this current case
is by far the most intriguing,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.616
rendering most if not all
the rest of the chapter

30:17.649 --> 30:18.985
utterly moot.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.853
Oh, no. No, no, no.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.554
No. No crumpling, Doc.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.223
Do not crumple.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.959
Okay, we will deliver
this baby as written,

30:26.993 --> 30:29.595
on time, and uncrumpled.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.632
Along with a proposal.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.167
A proposal?

30:35.201 --> 30:37.870
Yeah, for an entirely
new chapter dedicated solely

30:37.904 --> 30:39.872
to this insane case.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.140
I mean, think of it.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.910
War sticks, that-that
collector show.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.878
We don't even know the
outcome of this yet,

30:45.912 --> 30:48.881
and this could end up
your best chapter of all.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.317
You got that?

30:51.350 --> 30:54.420
You can be quite
an acquired taste, Kasie.

30:54.453 --> 30:57.523
Has anyone ever told you that?

30:57.556 --> 31:00.927
Only every teacher, coach and
relationship that I've ever had.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.029
Yes, well, allow me to express

31:03.062 --> 31:06.265
how grateful I am
to have acquired it.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.200
Mwah.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.670
Okay, now go. Go.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.405
I have
too much work to do.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.685
That... was... awesome.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.287
Seriously.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.456
I mean, it took
Jimmy, like, years

31:30.489 --> 31:33.025
to stand up to
Ducky like that.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.995
It's what he hired me to do.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.332
Hey, Abby, you sure you
want all this down here?

31:40.366 --> 31:43.269
There's plenty of space
up in the evidence garage.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.171
Um, that's fine.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.939
Oh, right
by Mass Spec.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.274
Yeah. I get it.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.510
Oh! When I say "Jimmy,"
you say "Hey!"

31:51.543 --> 31:53.545
Jimmy!
Crazy Kasie!

31:55.747 --> 31:57.984
Okeydoke.
Okay.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.119
Okay, yeah.

32:00.152 --> 32:03.122
It's all good, then?

32:03.155 --> 32:05.057
Yeah.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.227
Oh, return of the Mack.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.497
Out of the drawer and,
uh, on full display.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.033
You get it to work again?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.568
It's the best paperweight ever.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.504
It only takes antique staples,

32:18.537 --> 32:20.739
so I had to order more
from a dealer in Zurich,

32:20.772 --> 32:22.208
and they will be here next week.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.642
Once again, priceless.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.044
GIBBS:
Rich guy.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.545
What do we know?

32:26.578 --> 32:30.049
Well, we know he's our guy.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.251
Clarence Wyatt, 38.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.153
CEO of Red Eagle
Financial.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.655
He's an investment whiz
who, as far as we can tell,

32:36.688 --> 32:38.290
made his fortune
running a hedge fund.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.026
Born and raised
in Philadelphia,

32:40.059 --> 32:42.161
he is a true
rags-to-riches story.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.096
TORRES: You heard her
say Philly, home of

32:44.130 --> 32:46.465
the Reconnaissance Hall Museum.
Yeah. Got that.
What else?

32:46.498 --> 32:48.700
Out of high school,
Wyatt worked a few odd jobs,

32:48.734 --> 32:51.770
and one of them was as a driver
for a trucking company

32:51.803 --> 32:55.107
that specializes in delivery
of fine furnishings and artwork.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.775
You guys want to know
how long ago that was?

32:56.808 --> 32:57.743
DUCKY:
16 years?

32:59.611 --> 33:02.714
At long last, Jethro, we might
finally have the answer.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.317
Oh, what else do we need?

33:05.351 --> 33:07.186
We have any specific record

33:07.219 --> 33:09.255
of Wyatt delivering
from the museum in Philly

33:09.288 --> 33:11.790
to our storage space?
Well, not specifically.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.026
Then all we have
is circumstantial.
TORRES: Wait a minute.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.228
Wyatt gave me his business card.

33:20.366 --> 33:24.203
And, yes... it is titanium.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.640
Touch DNA.
It might have some.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.077
Well, if it does,
we must match it

33:31.110 --> 33:34.613
to anything this fellow
Wyatt may have touched

33:34.646 --> 33:36.415
in these crates
on the night

33:36.448 --> 33:38.750
that Petty Officer
Finn was murdered.

33:38.784 --> 33:41.687
I will do my best.
And as quickly as possible.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.822
If Jethro and I can't
coax a confession

33:43.855 --> 33:47.559
out of this scoundrel, we will
need definitive evidence.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.361
You got it.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.463
Um, there's at least, like,
30 more pieces here.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.066
I think I'm gonna see
if, um, Jimmy can help me.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.702
He might have gone home
already, but...
Oh, what about Kasie?

33:56.735 --> 33:59.138
What?
Kasie?

33:59.171 --> 34:01.607
Well, she graduated
in forensic science.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.144
Her degree is in

34:05.177 --> 34:06.578
forensic science.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.780
Ducky, why didn't
you tell me this?

34:08.814 --> 34:10.649
Kasie, why didn't you tell her?

34:10.682 --> 34:12.751
Because she hasn't
told me anything.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.087
She doesn't talk to me.
Yes, I do.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.488
:
Yes, she does.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.557
She talks to everybody.
ABBY: No.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.791
She doesn't.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.627
What did I do?

34:21.660 --> 34:23.295
You didn't do anything.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.497
Then what is
your problem with me?
I don't have

34:25.531 --> 34:27.866
a problem with you...
No, no, no.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

34:27.899 --> 34:32.138
Kasie, put on a lab coat,
scrub up and then, by all means,

34:32.171 --> 34:36.142
continue this suddenly
excruciating conversation

34:36.175 --> 34:38.644
while you work together,

34:38.677 --> 34:41.147
but out of my purview.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.588
*

35:08.307 --> 35:11.177
ABBY: Um, okay,
these we ran already.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.445
Those we ran.
These are next.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.881
And we're talking.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.384
We were never not talking.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.286
You were not
talking to me.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.888
Well, it wasn't intentional, and
it certainly had nothing to do

35:22.921 --> 35:24.890
with me having any
problem with you.

35:24.923 --> 35:28.594
I mean, quite the opposite.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.696
Opposite of what?

35:30.729 --> 35:34.600
I don't know. Um...

35:34.633 --> 35:38.370
Working on Doc's book, I learned
about you and what you do here,

35:38.404 --> 35:41.407
researched a little bit more,
and you just...

35:42.474 --> 35:44.643
You're like the Beatles,
you know?

35:46.312 --> 35:48.280
The Beatles?

35:48.314 --> 35:52.451
Yeah, the best at this,
doing what I want to be doing.

35:52.484 --> 35:56.488
And meeting you, I...
guess I'm just a fan.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.558
A fan?

35:59.591 --> 36:01.660
I freaked out.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.295
I-I just froze. I...

36:03.329 --> 36:07.533
Believe me, I was as
surprised as anyone.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.335
Well, how do you feel now?

36:09.368 --> 36:12.238
I mean, now we're just talking
and getting to know each other.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.808
Kasie?

36:16.842 --> 36:19.278
What is that?

36:22.548 --> 36:25.384
What is what?

36:25.417 --> 36:27.686
Under the splinter.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.955
Is that what
I think it is?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.525
I think...

36:35.494 --> 36:38.297
...it is.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.969
And now I'm hugging the Beatles
and freaking out all over again!

36:47.773 --> 36:49.741
Highly entertaining, gentlemen.

36:49.775 --> 36:53.579
I mean, yeah,
I once drove a truck in Philly.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.782
Hell, I'm proud of
my blue-collar roots.

36:56.815 --> 37:02.454
But delivering from one museum
to some storage place,

37:02.488 --> 37:03.789
with this Navy kid

37:03.822 --> 37:05.524
What did you
say his name was?

37:05.557 --> 37:08.627
Petty Officer Marvin Finn.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.463
Doesn't remotely ring a bell.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.500
Granted that was a lifetime ago.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.804
Beauty, isn't it?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.772
Patton's baby.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.875
Want to give it a spin?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.278
No. No, I'm good.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.751
So... if there's nothing else...

37:32.784 --> 37:34.786
You paid a lot for that.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.789
Yeah, I believe I discussed that
with the agents earlier today.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.693
15 Gs, it wasn't even Patton's.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.595
Come again?

37:43.629 --> 37:45.731
You overpaid
for Baxter's silence.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.867
When he said no,
or you weren't convinced,

37:48.900 --> 37:51.703
you waited out behind his shop
and you ambushed him.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.938
Whoa, what are you saying?

37:52.971 --> 37:54.573
What was I buying silence
for exactly?

37:54.606 --> 37:56.742
This.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.377
Oh, that thing again.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.978
That thing was in
the storage space.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.414
So was Petty Officer
Finn, so were you.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.316
And what was I doing there
exactly?

38:04.350 --> 38:05.551
Stealing,

38:05.584 --> 38:07.419
anything of value,

38:07.453 --> 38:10.422
until Petty Officer Finn
tried to stop you.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.324
GIBBS:
Which is when you stopped him.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.493
Same way you stopped Baxter
yesterday.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.329
Yeah, you then threw Finn
into the back of your truck

38:17.363 --> 38:19.331
and dumped him
miles away

38:19.365 --> 38:21.533
in the worst neighborhood
you could find.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.068
You sold the stick to Baxter.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.472
You were home free.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.006
Okay, you know what?

38:28.039 --> 38:30.342
You lost me.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.010
I'm no longer entertained.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.813
Hold that thought.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.648
Yeah, Abbs.
What do you got?

38:36.682 --> 38:39.084
Gibbs, we found skin.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.988
One itty bitty,
beautiful sliver of skin

38:43.021 --> 38:45.090
under a splinter
of wood.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.658
Mm

38:46.692 --> 38:51.430
And it matches the DNA
on Wyatt's titanium card.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.532
WYATT:
I suggest you and your

38:53.565 --> 38:56.568
sidekick show yourselves out.

38:56.602 --> 38:57.836
:
So we got him, huh?

38:57.869 --> 38:59.438
Oh,got him.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.774
You got what?

39:08.447 --> 39:09.748
WYATT:
Here.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.852
My full written statement.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.887
You happy now?

39:15.921 --> 39:17.789
No, Wyatt.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.625
Actually, not yet.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.059
I just got to know, man.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.595
Why didn't you throw away
that ugly stick?

39:23.629 --> 39:26.932
I guess I should have.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.800
You guess?

39:28.834 --> 39:30.869
You turn a chunk of wood
into a murder weapon.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.704
Why didn't you just bury it,
burn it?

39:34.640 --> 39:36.575
That ugly stick
started everything.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.511
Baxter gave me
two grand for it,

39:39.545 --> 39:42.080
which I parlayed
into two billion.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.983
That talisman stuff is real.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.587
That was one lucky
chunk of wood.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.988
Not anymore.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.591
Not anymore.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.626
Well, better late
than never.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.895
And so much
better together.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.163
And really well done, Kasie.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.898
No, don't try to
butter me up, Doc.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.833
You write your proposal yet?

40:01.867 --> 40:04.470
I've been a little preoccupied.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.671
That's putting it mildly.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.639
Can we focus
on your book again?

40:07.673 --> 40:09.841
You will have
my complete attention.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.444
We have three days.
Move those Duck feathers.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.480
Let's go.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.956
Holy moly.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.825
I'm flattered, Gibbs.

40:26.858 --> 40:29.595
I finally made it
to your inner sanctum.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.763
It's a basement.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.099
I'm not even gonna
ask about that.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.168
Unless that's what
you wanted to show me.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.204
No.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.641
Ah.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.042
Is this your collection?

40:44.075 --> 40:45.944
Yeah, I just thought
you'd appreciate it.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.547
You fought a war.
Sure not the same war.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.049
But, uh, it's a wonderful
time capsule.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.755
*

41:02.594 --> 41:05.531
Takes you back to
a time, a place.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.768
Person?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.809
My dad's.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.013
It's his old, um, razor.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.284
They sure don't make 'em
like that anymore, huh?
No.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.786
No, they do not.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.156
They do not, which makes
finding parts for them

41:31.189 --> 41:33.191
hard as hell,
I can tell you that.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.228
But I got lucky the other day.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.665
Yeah, you did.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.768
Bingo. Bingo.
That's better.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.803
Lot better.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.773
And cool as hell.

41:50.776 --> 41:54.713
How much is something like that
worth to a collector, you think?

41:54.746 --> 41:56.782
Not much.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.687
How about to you?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.695
The steaks are burning.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.630
Oh, yeah, yeah. I smell that.

42:11.663 --> 42:14.232
Oh, good catch.
Yeah.

42:14.265 --> 42:17.002
I like mine medium-rare.
Are you like a well guy?

42:17.035 --> 42:19.237
Ah.
