Spot:
It looked bad for the kid.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.080
He was accused
of stealing kibble.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.380
The prosecution
had a solid case.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.460
Only a miracle
could save him.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.420
Or a chicken.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.040
It all started three days ago,

01:31.040 --> 01:34.710
on a morning as bland
as a potato pancake.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.080
But it soon turned sour

01:36.080 --> 01:38.710
as a pickle
in a pitcher of lemonade.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.540
Nanny, it's been stolen!

01:41.540 --> 01:44.670
My model train set is gone.
Somebody stole it!

01:44.670 --> 01:47.170
Oh, maybe you just
misplaced it.

01:47.170 --> 01:50.460
Well, how could I
misplace an entire train?

01:50.460 --> 01:52.080
They even took the track.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.380
Do you know how hard it is
to replace G

02:03.210 --> 02:06.460
Come on, Rolly, you don't
wanna miss breakfast.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.120
Ohh! I'd rather
sleep than eat.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
Ugggh!

02:11.120 --> 02:13.960
Come on, Rolly,
you can do it!

02:17.380 --> 02:19.080
all: Oooh!

02:19.080 --> 02:21.710
Uh-huh!

02:35.290 --> 02:36.880
We can't be out of kibble.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.420
I just filled the Chow Tower
two days ago!

02:39.420 --> 02:42.120
Well, maybe
it's just stuck.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.830
Empty!

02:47.830 --> 02:51.000
101 dogs and no kibble.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.420
It's a recipe for disaster.

02:53.420 --> 02:57.960
The crime: an entire silo
full of kibble, vanished,

02:57.960 --> 03:00.880
like a wallet
at a pickpocket's convention.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.040
The problem: no clear
explanation why.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.580
The plan: investigate.

03:08.830 --> 03:12.000
Leave it to the mayor to make
political hay out of the case.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.710
A serious crime
has been committed

03:14.710 --> 03:16.920
against 101--

03:16.920 --> 03:19.040
Hey, 102!

03:19.040 --> 03:21.000
Ahem!

03:21.000 --> 03:25.380
Against more than 100 voters--
er, citizens--

03:25.380 --> 03:26.880
of this here barnyard.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.290
Lieutenant Pug.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.250
Yes, sir!

03:30.250 --> 03:32.580
I'm officially putting
your Bark Brigade

03:32.580 --> 03:35.040
in charge of guarding
the Chow Tower.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.830
You will stand watch
all night if necessary

03:37.830 --> 03:42.170
to protect this community's
essential supply of kibble.

03:42.170 --> 03:45.500
Consider it done,
sir!

03:45.500 --> 03:48.250
Night fell
like a lump of lead.

03:48.250 --> 03:52.080
The lieutenant went into
his usual song and dance.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.080
Look sharp, cadets!

03:54.080 --> 03:57.290
Obviously, marauding c-cats

03:57.290 --> 03:59.210
are raiding the Chow Tower

03:59.210 --> 04:01.620
and stealing precious kibble.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.790
Somebody's added a new wing
to Paranoia Palace.

04:04.790 --> 04:07.880
Our mission is to attack
and crush their army

04:07.880 --> 04:10.420
with overwhelming force!

04:10.420 --> 04:12.830
Any questions?

04:12.830 --> 04:15.330
Good! Since there are
no questions,

04:15.330 --> 04:17.620
to your posts!

04:21.790 --> 04:23.460
The hours dragged

04:23.460 --> 04:26.000
like a shopping cart
through wet cement.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.210
Huh?

04:30.210 --> 04:31.460
Then I heard it...

04:33.920 --> 04:37.500
something in the darkness,
moving.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.290
Who's out there?!

04:41.290 --> 04:44.290
Then the ground got nervous.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.380
Cat attack!

04:48.380 --> 04:50.500
And they got tanks!

04:50.500 --> 04:52.210
Lucky, roll out the cannon!

04:52.210 --> 04:54.830
Cadet Cadpig,
man the machine gun.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.290
Cadet Spot!

04:56.290 --> 04:58.670
Don't just stand there!

05:00.670 --> 05:03.250
Pug: Fire cannon!

05:03.250 --> 05:05.580
Fire machine gun!

05:15.120 --> 05:16.460
They're in retreat!

05:16.460 --> 05:18.080
Heh heh heh heh!

05:18.080 --> 05:20.750
Not a tank in sight.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.290
Aaaaah!

05:23.670 --> 05:26.710
Lieutenant Pug, we can't
find Rolly anywhere.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.750
Then they've got him.

05:28.750 --> 05:34.120
Oh, I hate to think how
those cats will make him suffer!

05:34.120 --> 05:36.750
First, they'll toy with him.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.420
Then...

05:38.420 --> 05:40.620
Wait! There he is!

05:41.880 --> 05:45.790
Ohh! Brought down
by friendly fire.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.920
Rolly!

05:47.920 --> 05:49.920
Are you all right?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.750
I guess so.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.750
Charging the enemy
in the midst
of an artillery barrage

05:55.750 --> 05:57.330
takes guts!

05:57.330 --> 05:58.670
You'll get a medal
for this.

05:58.670 --> 06:03.380
Something here was fishier
than a bucket of red herrings,

06:03.380 --> 06:06.670
but I couldn't put
my finger on it, yet.

06:09.170 --> 06:12.750
Dawn arrived, as it always did,
early.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.710
Spirits were high.

06:14.710 --> 06:17.710
Word had spread
of the lieutenant's victory.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.710
And the kid was
the toast of the trough...

06:22.880 --> 06:23.830
Ahh!

06:29.210 --> 06:30.880
...for about six seconds.

06:32.830 --> 06:35.580
Despite the stakeout,
the Chow Tower

06:35.580 --> 06:38.420
was as empty
as a gangster's promise.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.620
Oh, not again!

06:42.620 --> 06:44.620
If this pilferage doesn't stop,

06:44.620 --> 06:47.250
we won't be able to keep
101 dogs.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.500
all: What?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.670
It was time to call in
the big dog.

06:51.670 --> 06:56.790
This was a job for
Pullet Marlowe, Private Chick.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.080
Ugggh!

07:02.830 --> 07:06.750
I began my investigation
with a visit to a known felon,

07:06.750 --> 07:10.830
a convicted egg thief named
after a lot of boiled dough.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.830
Spot:
Morning, Dumpling.

07:13.830 --> 07:17.620
Uh, you are blocking
my sunbeam, Spot.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.790
Spot: Call me Marlowe.

07:20.790 --> 07:24.290
I see you are playing
Private Cluck again.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.750
I see you are
putting on weight.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.750
Flattery
will get you nowhere.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.250
Funny, you putting
on the pounds

07:32.250 --> 07:35.500
with so much kibble
mysteriously missing.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.580
You've got nothing on me.
I'm as clean as new-fallen snow.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.710
In a pig's eye.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.580
You got a record
a mile long, sweetheart.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.790
That egg-nappin'
was never proven!

07:45.790 --> 07:47.960
Never proven?
You confessed
to the crime.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.580
Dumpling: So? You got me
on a technicality.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.040
Move on, Marlowe!

07:52.040 --> 07:55.790
My daughter's as clean
as new-fallen snow.

07:55.790 --> 07:59.210
I was about to point out that
we'd already used that gag,

07:59.210 --> 08:00.580
when somebody dumped

08:00.580 --> 08:02.540
a truckload of stars
on my head.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.790
I woke up a few yards later

08:08.790 --> 08:11.580
and decided to continue
my investigation

08:11.580 --> 08:14.790
where the air didn't smell
like raw bacon.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.250
The suspect: Scorch.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.790
Look up "thief"
in the dictionary

08:18.790 --> 08:20.250
and you'll find his picture.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.620
He's also listed

08:21.620 --> 08:23.540
under "burglar,"
"crook," and "earwax,"

08:23.540 --> 08:25.540
but I think the last one
was a typo.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.750
The name's Marlowe.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.120
Enjoying your meal?

08:36.920 --> 08:40.290
No substitute
for kibble, is it?

08:40.290 --> 08:42.710
Er, uh, I don't know.

08:42.710 --> 08:45.960
Oh, you don't,
do youuuuuuu?!

08:45.960 --> 08:48.580
Whoaaaa!

08:52.290 --> 08:55.380
Oh, I do adore the scent
of deadly nightshade.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.540
Oooh!

08:56.540 --> 08:59.330
Oooh!
That was a mistake.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.620
Nooooo!

09:21.880 --> 09:23.000
Whoa!

09:33.420 --> 09:34.710
Oh, oh!

09:42.290 --> 09:45.210
Cruella: Come back here!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.120
Spot: Yeowwww!

09:54.120 --> 09:55.540
Hah! Aaaah!

10:02.540 --> 10:04.460
Three words for you, chicken:

10:04.460 --> 10:06.880
deep fat fryer!

10:12.750 --> 10:16.170
One last suspect
filled out my list,

10:16.170 --> 10:17.920
a character so low,

10:17.920 --> 10:20.960
he needed elevator shoes
to reach the gutter.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.170
Did you say
elevator shoes?

10:23.170 --> 10:25.620
Spot: No, that was a voice-over.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.830
And I'm not here
to shop, Swamp Rat.

10:27.830 --> 10:31.170
Unless you're
discounting kibble
this week.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.920
Don't deal
in perishables.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.580
You're fishing for clues
and I'm plumb out.

10:35.580 --> 10:39.250
Look at me:
I'm laid up, incapacitated,

10:39.250 --> 10:41.460
helpless as a baby
on a bobsled.

10:41.460 --> 10:45.170
Eeeeeeh!

10:45.170 --> 10:47.250
Dang thing itches
like the dickens, too.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.420
Steven!

10:49.580 --> 10:52.380
Kindly show
this here flatfoot out.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.830
Ugggh!

11:01.290 --> 11:03.750
You got off easy.

11:07.290 --> 11:10.210
The next time you come
nosin' around...

11:14.120 --> 11:16.460
What did I know so far?

11:16.460 --> 11:19.710
Besides what the inside
of Steven's yapper looks like.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.250
What facts are missing?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.330
What else do I need to know?

11:23.330 --> 11:25.920
I felt like a Slinky
on an escalator.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.500
I was getting nowhere, fast.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.290
But I still had work to do.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.330
I decided to try
the team approach.

11:33.330 --> 11:36.420
This is the time to think
broadly and carefully

11:36.420 --> 11:38.000
about the facts, kids.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.880
Here's what we know so far.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.960
We have three main suspects:
Dumpling!

11:42.960 --> 11:44.620
Known food thief.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.540
Scorch!
Light-fingered by nature.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.540
And Swamp Rat!

11:49.540 --> 11:50.750
Enough said.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.420
What is your assessment
of the facts?

11:53.420 --> 11:54.540
What makes sense?

11:54.540 --> 11:57.420
And what still seems
puzzling?

11:57.420 --> 11:59.120
Dumpling's small-time.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.330
A major kibble heist
is inconsistent

12:01.330 --> 12:03.460
with her
psychological profile.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.750
Yeah, and Scorch
can have anything
he wants to eat.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.920
Why would he
steal kibble?

12:08.920 --> 12:11.120
And the Swamp Rat's laid up...

12:12.460 --> 12:13.880
...with a broken leg.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.380
My thoughts exactly.

12:16.380 --> 12:20.330
But there is
one more suspect.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.290
Rolly: Who?

12:22.290 --> 12:24.380
You!

12:24.380 --> 12:25.880
Huh?

12:25.880 --> 12:27.670
The morning
after the first heist,

12:27.670 --> 12:30.620
only you weren't hungry.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.790
I'd rather
sleep than eat.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.080
The night of the stakeout,

12:39.080 --> 12:42.580
you were mysteriously missing
during the battle.

12:42.580 --> 12:47.290
Lieutenant Pug,
we can't find Rolly
anywhere.

12:47.290 --> 12:50.920
When we fired into the dark,
the only thing we hit...

12:50.920 --> 12:52.880
was you!

12:54.830 --> 12:58.620
But... I didn't steal
the kibble, I swear!

12:58.620 --> 13:02.330
If Rolly says he didn't do it,
then that's good enough for me.

13:02.330 --> 13:05.120
Spot: There's only
one other explanation.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.000
But I'll need your help
to test my theory.

13:09.380 --> 13:13.580
That night I kept myself awake
by reading the grocery ads.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.460
Around midnight,
my hunch bore fruit.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.420
Yaaaah!

13:25.420 --> 13:28.580
The kid was sleepwalking.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.710
Spot: A little help here, guys.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.830
Uh, Lucky?

13:34.830 --> 13:36.710
Wake up!
It's Rolly.

13:36.710 --> 13:37.750
Huh?

13:42.330 --> 13:43.670
Ow!

13:43.670 --> 13:44.960
Come on!

13:51.250 --> 13:54.250
Hmm. He's headed
for the garden.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.080
Well, at least he isn't headed
for the Chow Tower.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.290
As I suspected,

14:15.290 --> 14:17.620
Rolly's not only
been sleepwalking,

14:17.620 --> 14:19.420
he's been sleep eating.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.710
So, he is the kibble culprit!

14:33.710 --> 14:35.080
Pug: A traitor!

14:35.080 --> 14:39.210
Oh, this is a very dark day
for the Bark Brigade!

14:48.330 --> 14:49.580
Huh?

14:49.580 --> 14:52.670
We have to wake him up before
he gets to the Chow Tower!

14:52.670 --> 14:55.170
Yeah. If he eats
another tower of food,

14:55.170 --> 14:57.830
Roger will kick us all out
for good!

14:57.830 --> 15:00.250
Pug: Everyone, freeze!

15:00.250 --> 15:03.830
I'm in charge
of this operation here.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.290
Lucky: Where's Rolly?

15:19.290 --> 15:22.000
We had to stop the kid
before he turned the Chow Tower

15:22.000 --> 15:24.500
into his own
private smorgasbord.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.210
Hey, listen!

15:26.210 --> 15:28.830
I've heard that
rumble before.

15:28.830 --> 15:32.830
Yeah, from Rolly's stomach
on pizza night!

15:32.830 --> 15:34.750
I'm afraid we're too late.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.210
Oh, Rolly!

15:40.210 --> 15:43.250
Cadets, check the tower.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.330
all: Ohhhh!

15:55.920 --> 15:58.790
The lieutenant put the kid
through the wringer

15:58.790 --> 16:00.460
and hung him out to dry.

16:00.460 --> 16:06.250
I order you, Rolly, banished
from the barnyard!

16:09.250 --> 16:12.170
They sent the kid packing
the next morning.

16:12.170 --> 16:16.080
It looked like I could
stamp this one "case closed."

16:16.080 --> 16:18.790
But a few loose ends
were bugging me.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.880
Like... little buggy things.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.830
What was that rumble
we kept hearing?

16:24.830 --> 16:27.460
The Chow Tower had guards
posted continually

16:27.460 --> 16:29.250
after the first raid.

16:29.250 --> 16:32.040
but still the kibble
disappeared.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.620
And did anyone actually see
the kid steal the kibble?

16:35.620 --> 16:39.120
No! The case against him
is totally circumstantial.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.250
It was my fault
they nailed the kid.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.620
And something about it
stuck in my gullet.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.960
Stuck in a gullet!

16:45.960 --> 16:47.120
Of course!

16:47.120 --> 16:51.040
Suddenly I knew
who the real thief was.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.120
You wanna watch TV?

17:00.120 --> 17:03.250
No. It isn't the same

17:03.250 --> 17:06.170
without Rolly drooling
in all the food commercials.

17:06.170 --> 17:09.960
You two look like a couple
of jailbirds on Mother's Day.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.670
Cheer up, I brought you
a visitor.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.250
Cadpig: Rolly!

17:16.790 --> 17:19.420
Oh, Rolly,
we missed you.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.790
But if Mayor Pig
catches you here...

17:22.790 --> 17:26.500
After tonight, Mayor Pig will be
pinning medals on the kid.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.620
What do you mean?

17:27.620 --> 17:31.120
You'll see tonight
at the stakeout.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.790
Lucky: But we already
staked out the tower
and didn't see a thing.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.500
Spot: We felt something, though,
and heard it.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.500
See, we've been watching
the tower from the outside,

17:40.500 --> 17:44.290
but I think
this is an inside job.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.960
It bothered me that Rolly
could eat so much kibble.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.670
Even his stomach would have
trouble holding it all.

17:49.670 --> 17:50.750
No offense, kid.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.460
None taken.

17:52.460 --> 17:56.040
Besides, a heist like this
takes organization,

17:56.040 --> 17:59.000
distribution, manpower.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.620
Like the finger
of a well-paid stoolie,

18:01.620 --> 18:05.120
everything points
to one person.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.540
We'll know soon enough
if my theory is correct.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.880
Hyah!

18:13.250 --> 18:15.040
Cannonball!

18:17.540 --> 18:19.960
Now, we wait.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.420
Quietly!

18:24.420 --> 18:25.960
Sorry.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.290
-This it it.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.710
What's happening?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.120
It's being taken from below!

18:36.290 --> 18:38.830
Hey, I had a dream
like this once.

18:38.830 --> 18:40.420
all: Whoa!

18:49.380 --> 18:51.080
I knew it!

18:54.920 --> 18:57.120
Waaaah!

18:58.920 --> 19:00.250
Whoa!

19:16.960 --> 19:18.120
Huh?

19:25.750 --> 19:28.710
Good-bye, chicken!

19:33.920 --> 19:36.620
Who you callin' chicken?!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.080
Hah!

19:49.830 --> 19:51.880
You'll never get away
with this, Swamp Rat!

19:51.880 --> 19:54.960
I've got just one word
for you.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.080
Wait!

19:58.710 --> 20:00.830
Yowwww!

20:14.920 --> 20:18.920
Spot! I mean Marlowe.
Are you all right ?

20:18.920 --> 20:21.250
The day I let
a little train wreck stop me

20:21.250 --> 20:23.500
is the day I hang up my fedora.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.880
But the culprit
took it on the chin.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.170
Heh heh!
But he has one.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.330
Once I blew a hole
in the rat's alibi,

20:34.330 --> 20:36.880
all the pieces began
to fall into place.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.920
You see,
I remembered something.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.830
When I went
into the gator's gullet,

20:42.830 --> 20:46.210
the Swamp Rat's cast
was on his left leg.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.790
When I emerged
a few minutes later,

20:48.790 --> 20:51.540
the cast was on his right leg.

20:53.790 --> 20:55.920
He probably took it off
for a good scratch

20:55.920 --> 20:58.460
and put it on the other foot.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.790
Trusting, of course,
that the impact
to your psyche

21:01.790 --> 21:05.120
of being swallowed
alive by a huge,
carnivorous reptile

21:05.120 --> 21:07.250
would distract you
from noticing the switch.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.210
Congratulations, Marlowe.
You solved another one.

21:12.210 --> 21:14.460
And, uh, thanks.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.620
Roger had no idea why his train

21:18.620 --> 21:20.920
suddenly showed up again
in the barnyard,

21:20.920 --> 21:22.580
but he was glad
to get it back.

21:22.580 --> 21:26.790
Even if it was
a little worse for wear.

21:26.790 --> 21:29.580
Rolly was welcomed back
to the barnyard

21:29.580 --> 21:32.250
with special
midnight kibble privileges,

21:32.250 --> 21:36.750
and a public apology from
the Mayor and Lieutenant Pug.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.880
As for the Swamp Rat,

21:38.880 --> 21:41.750
he was forced to return
all the stolen goods

21:41.750 --> 21:44.540
he hadn't already sold
on the black kibble market

21:44.540 --> 21:46.670
and replace the rest.

21:46.670 --> 21:49.880
Humph! I'd say he learned
the hard way

21:49.880 --> 21:52.170
that crime doesn't pay.

21:52.170 --> 21:54.670
And even when it does pay,
humph,

21:54.670 --> 21:56.210
it doesn't pay much.

21:56.210 --> 22:00.170
And even when it pays a lot,
the check always bounces.

22:00.170 --> 22:03.880
And even if it pays cash,
the bills will be counterfeit.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.170
Oh, yeah, and even if the...

22:07.210 --> 22:09.750
Hey, I still had
some metaphors left!

22:09.750 --> 22:12.880
Some people never know
when to quit.
