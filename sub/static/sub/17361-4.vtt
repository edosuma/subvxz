WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:04.076
(clock ticking)

00:16.725 --> 00:19.683
(breathes deeply)

00:19.853 --> 00:21.935
(ticking continues)

00:54.929 --> 00:56.715
(weapon thuds lightly)

01:08.193 --> 01:10.434
(bag rustling)

01:21.664 --> 01:23.279
(door creaks)

01:30.340 --> 01:32.251
(birds chirp in distance)

01:36.346 --> 01:39.008
(birds chirping, crows cawing)

02:02.038 --> 02:04.074
(bag thuds)

02:18.221 --> 02:20.587
(chirping continues)

02:40.243 --> 02:42.074
Good morning.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.655
Tch4ch4ch.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.790
Oh, here, look at that.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.917
- Shh.
- (fusses)

02:54.132 --> 02:57.169
(vehicle approaching)

03:01.431 --> 03:04.423
Could you open the gate?

03:04.601 --> 03:07.013
Eugene.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.848
Yeah?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.188
Open the gate.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.937
Goin' out to see if we can find
anything for when they come.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.946
You want to help?

03:21.117 --> 03:23.153
(engine idling)

03:23.328 --> 03:25.865
I don't believe
I'd be up to that.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.950
Yeah, sounds about right.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.497
I'm repairin' this portable
audio system for them.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.286
We'll have a perfectly
respectable music player

03:35.465 --> 03:36.830
when they arrive.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.464
I'm dealing
in certainties,

03:38.635 --> 03:41.001
and I'm doing my part
to give them what they want.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.670
(vehicles, motorcycles approaching)

03:52.565 --> 03:54.851
(air brakes hissing)

04:00.990 --> 04:03.606
(Negan whistling brightly)

04:08.248 --> 04:11.206
J‘ Dun-dun-dun dun. J‘

04:11.376 --> 04:13.958
(banging)

04:15.838 --> 04:21.799
(singsong voice)
Little pig, little pig, let me in!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.728
(gate rattles)

04:43.199 --> 04:45.315
Well?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.620
Um, who are you?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.623
Oh, you better be jokin'.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.784
Negan, Lucille.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.204
I know I had to make
a pretty strong first impression.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.547
Well, hello, there.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.062
Do not make me
have to ask.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.895
You said a week.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.809
You're early.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.445
(gate creaking)

05:30.330 --> 05:32.491
I missed you.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.656
(walker growling)

05:34.834 --> 05:36.574
(chuckles)

05:36.753 --> 05:39.586
Oh, Rick,
come on out here.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.121
Watch this.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.255
Calling it!

05:43.426 --> 05:46.168
(walker growling)

05:48.264 --> 05:49.253
(grunts)

05:49.432 --> 05:50.421
(bodythuds)

05:50.600 --> 05:51.806
Ha ha ha!

05:51.976 --> 05:55.093
Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

05:55.271 --> 05:57.307
All right, everybody.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.473
Let's get started.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.481
Big day.

06:10.536 --> 06:15.781
Hey, Rick, you see that,
what ljust did?

06:15.958 --> 06:18.290
That is some service!

06:18.461 --> 06:22.420
I mean, we almost get turned
away at the gate.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.296
"Who is that guy, anyway?"

06:24.467 --> 06:26.503
Do | get mad?
Do I throw a fit?

06:26.677 --> 06:29.464
Do | bash
some ginger's dome in?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.049
Nope.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.135
| just take care of one
of these dead pricks

06:33.309 --> 06:35.015
that could've killed
one of y'all.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.016
Service.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.816
Hold this.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.327
(music playing)

07:31.701 --> 07:34.033
Hot diggity dog!

07:34.203 --> 07:37.195
This place is magnificent!

07:37.373 --> 07:40.957
An embarrassment of riches,
as they say.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.118
Yes, sir, I do believe

07:43.296 --> 07:47.255
you are gonna have plenty
to offer up.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.711
(Negan chuckles)

07:49.886 --> 07:51.376
Daryl, hey--

07:51.554 --> 07:53.135
No.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.546
Nope.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.093
He's the help.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.260
You don't look at him,

08:01.439 --> 08:02.679
you don't talk to him,

08:02.857 --> 08:05.849
and I don't make you
chop anything off of him.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.034
J‘ Same goes for everyone. I

08:23.711 --> 08:25.952
Right?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.303
(exhales sharply)

08:44.482 --> 08:46.894
A lot of suspense there.

08:47.068 --> 08:51.186
I don't think
she even knew how much.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.029
All right, let's get this show
on the road.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.191
See what kind of goodies
you got in the cupboard.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.825
We put aside
half the supplies.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.281
No, Rick.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.243
No.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.619
You don't decide
what we take.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.667
I do.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.257
Arat.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.385
You heard the man.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.889
Move out!

09:31.696 --> 09:34.358
They're just gonna search
the houses a bit,

09:34.532 --> 09:36.614
keep the process movin'.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.946
(sighs)
All right.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.036
You gonna
show me around or not?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.962
Well?

10:02.059 --> 10:04.596
(singsong voice)
Rosita!

10:06.188 --> 10:07.473
Where you going
with your friend here?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.888
We were just
heading back to--

10:09.066 --> 10:11.978
You know what?
I don't care.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.688
(sighs)

10:43.893 --> 10:46.009
(sighing)

10:50.941 --> 10:52.226
(sighs)

10:52.401 --> 10:54.517
Now that that's
all settled,

10:54.695 --> 10:56.481
I got a job for ya.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.314
Go get me Daryl's bike.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.279
It ain't here.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.693
Well, if it ain't here,

11:03.871 --> 11:06.032
then you know
where it is, right?

11:07.792 --> 11:11.125
We both know you know
where it is.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.547
(sharply)
Uh...

11:26.394 --> 11:29.557
Now you're good to go.

11:34.735 --> 11:35.941
So go.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.525
- Oh, oh.
- (car door slams)

11:40.700 --> 11:41.906
Oh.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.781
(sighs)

11:53.754 --> 11:56.291
Don't take too long.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.048
(engine starts)

12:15.943 --> 12:18.275
(birds chirping)

12:34.044 --> 12:36.126
(growling in distance)

12:43.429 --> 12:45.294
(gunshot booms)

12:54.356 --> 12:56.096
(shell casing rattles)

12:59.278 --> 13:01.234
(gunshot booms)

13:01.405 --> 13:04.989
(shell casing rattles)

13:05.159 --> 13:07.150
(gunshot booms)

13:07.328 --> 13:08.613
(gunshot booms)

13:08.788 --> 13:10.699
(shell casing rattles)

13:10.873 --> 13:12.955
(walker growling)

13:13.125 --> 13:16.037
(gunshots booming)

13:16.212 --> 13:17.873
(growling continues)

13:18.047 --> 13:20.959
(panting)

13:21.133 --> 13:24.000
Damn it.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.636
(growling)

14:27.616 --> 14:28.867
Negan:
You see this?

14:29.034 --> 14:32.822
This is the kind of thing
that just tickles my balls.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.407
A little cooperation

14:34.582 --> 14:37.289
and everything is pleasant
as punch.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.201
You see, we really are
reasonable people

14:40.379 --> 14:42.495
once you get to know us.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.413
Honest.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.210
Ohh.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.377
Man.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.387
(tab pops)

14:57.396 --> 14:59.102
- Ahh!
- (can thuds lightly)

14:59.273 --> 15:01.013
Damn, I love this place!

15:01.191 --> 15:02.271
Man: Negan.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.322
Somethin' you might
wanna see.

15:07.489 --> 15:11.858
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

15:12.036 --> 15:16.370
I got my fingers crossed
for a little freaky-deaky.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.575
(video camera beeps)

15:17.750 --> 15:19.536
Rick: ...know me.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.246
l've killed people.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.912
- I don't even know how many by now.
- Jee-hee-sus!

15:25.090 --> 15:27.581
But I know why
they're all dead.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.751
Is that you, Rick,
underneath all that man-bush?

15:29.929 --> 15:32.921
They're dead so my family,
all those people out there,

15:33.098 --> 15:34.599
- can be alive.
- Shee-ot.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.180
I would not have messed
with that guy.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.969
(video camera beeps)

15:42.358 --> 15:45.475
But that's not
you anymore...

15:45.653 --> 15:48.065
is it?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.651
Nope.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.988
I really gotta
shave this shit.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.790
Whatever happened
to that sick girl?

16:01.961 --> 16:06.421
That seemed like a hell of
a stressful night for her.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.205
The way she was carrying on,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.716
she was married
to number two, right?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.501
Careful.

16:12.680 --> 16:17.595
Careful how
you're lookin' at me, Rick.

16:17.768 --> 16:22.637
Widows, especially ones
that look like that...

16:22.815 --> 16:24.021
(exhales sharply)

16:24.191 --> 16:26.898
...they are special.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.060
I love 'em.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.728
Right after
their husbands go,

16:30.906 --> 16:35.275
they are just empty inside.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.864
(singsong voice)
But usually not for long.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.199
(chuckles suggestively)

16:40.374 --> 16:42.865
Ahh.
Where is she?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.579
I would love to see her.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.254
Father Gabriel:
Do you care to pay your respects?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.380
Ho-ly crap!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.420
You are creepy as shit,

16:52.594 --> 16:53.925
sneaking up on me,

16:54.096 --> 16:56.929
wearin' that collar
with that freaky-ass smile.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.969
My apologies.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.055
l'm Father Gabriel.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.514
(chuckles)

17:08.777 --> 17:11.234
She didn't make it?

17:17.703 --> 17:20.319
Damn tragedy.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.330
That's what this is.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.752
(breathes deeply)

17:25.919 --> 17:28.626
Well, this must really suck
for you guys.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.372
Number one?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.882
That was on me.
No choice there.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.169
Lessons had to be learned.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.962
But number two?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.631
That didn't need to happen.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.643
Daryl, there,
he forced my hand.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.431
Probably put her
right on her back, huh?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.145
Damn.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.856
l was gonna ask her
to come back with me.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.146
Oh, I know
what you're thinkin'.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.565
How could I have a shot,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.859
guy that just bashed
her husband's head in?

18:00.037 --> 18:02.949
(chuckles)
You'd be surprised.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.363
Boy, people, they--

18:04.541 --> 18:06.077
(gunshot in distance,
glass shatters)

18:20.808 --> 18:23.550
Put some back
or the next one goes in you.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.969
(chuckles)
Kid...

18:27.147 --> 18:28.808
what do you think
happens next?

18:28.982 --> 18:30.438
You die.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.193
Carl, Carl, put it down.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.025
No. He's taking
all of our medicine.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.155
They said only half
our stuff.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.159
Negan:
Of course.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.696
Oh-ho.
Really, kid?

18:45.874 --> 18:49.116
And you should go.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.546
Before you find out
how dangerous we all are.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.379
Well, pardon me, young man.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.169
Excuse the shit out
of my goddamn French, but...

18:59.346 --> 19:01.211
did you just threaten me?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.473
Look, | get
threatening Davey here,

19:04.643 --> 19:05.928
but I can't have it.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.388
Not him, not me.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.598
Carl, just put it down.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.228
Negan:
Don't be rude, Rick.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.061
We are having
a conversation here.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.900
Now, boy, where were we?

19:19.074 --> 19:20.314
Oh, yeah.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.609
Your giant, man-sized balls.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.278
No threatening us.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.372
Listen, I like you,

19:29.543 --> 19:31.875
so I don't want to go hard
proving a point here.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.421
You don't want that.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.578
I said half your shit,

19:34.756 --> 19:37.418
and half is what
I say it is.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.551
I'm serious.

19:40.721 --> 19:44.555
Do you want me
to prove how serious?

19:44.725 --> 19:47.057
Again?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.061
(sighs)

19:55.944 --> 19:57.275
(exhales sharply)

19:59.489 --> 20:02.697
(sighs)

20:02.868 --> 20:05.109
You know, Rick,
this whole thing reminds me

20:05.287 --> 20:08.279
that you have
a lot of guns.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.914
There's all the guns you took
from my outpost

20:11.084 --> 20:12.620
when you wasted
all my people

20:12.794 --> 20:15.627
with a shit-ton
of your own guns,

20:15.797 --> 20:18.504
and I'm bettin'
there's even more,

20:18.675 --> 20:21.052
which adds up
to an absolute

20:21.220 --> 20:23.632
ass-load of guns,

20:23.805 --> 20:25.887
and as this little
emotional outburst

20:26.058 --> 20:27.969
just made crystal clear,

20:28.143 --> 20:30.600
I can't allow that.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.274
They're all mine now.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.029
So tell me, Rick...

20:44.660 --> 20:46.696
where are my guns?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.289
(garage door motor whirring)

21:03.303 --> 21:06.215
Olivia:
I... figured you were coming.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.306
Show him where
the guns are, Olivia.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.638
The armory's inside.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.563
Negan:
You run the show in here?

21:20.028 --> 21:24.397
| just keep track of it all--
the rations, the guns.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.611
Good. Smart.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.117
Don't let me stop you.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.700
Take her out, boys.
Show 'em the goods.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.538
Wait, wait, wait.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.334
Negan:
While they're at it,

21:45.512 --> 21:46.592
ljust want to
point out to you

21:46.763 --> 21:49.254
that I'm not taking
a scrap of your food.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.597
Slim pickin's in here.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.306
And I can't be
the only one to notice

21:55.480 --> 21:57.687
that you got
a fat lady in charge

21:57.858 --> 22:01.066
of keeping track of rations,
can I?

22:01.236 --> 22:04.273
Either way,
you starve to death,

22:04.448 --> 22:05.483
I don't get shit,

22:05.657 --> 22:09.024
so for now,
you get to keep all the food.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.111
How 'bout that?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.502
What do you
want me to say?

22:20.672 --> 22:21.787
I don't know, Rick.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.671
How about a thank you.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.298
You think that might be
in order?

22:25.469 --> 22:27.960
Or is that too much
to ask?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.632
(chuckles)

22:36.772 --> 22:37.761
Ohh.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.272
I know we started off
on the wrong foot,

22:41.443 --> 22:45.311
but what can I say?
You forced my hand, Rick.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.563
But it's like I've been
tryin' to tell you--

22:48.742 --> 22:52.280
I'm a very reasonable man
as long as you cooperate,

22:52.454 --> 22:55.696
so let me ask you
a question, Rick.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.043
Are you cooperating?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.545
What's it look like?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.956
Oh-ho-ho.

23:06.134 --> 23:10.468
I know what it looks like.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.721
But what I really want
to know is

23:12.891 --> 23:14.847
if we're gonna find all the guns
back there

23:15.018 --> 23:19.261
or if maybe you got a few just
waitin' for their moment...

23:20.357 --> 23:21.938
just like my Lucille.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.939
They're all in there,
to the best of my knowledge.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.573
Mm.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.701
lam countin' on that,
Rick.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.670
(engine shuts off)

23:57.394 --> 24:00.261
(car doors close)

24:28.467 --> 24:29.798
Still here.

24:48.945 --> 24:52.904
Look, I know this sucks,
but you saw what happened.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.235
You saw how many of them
are there today.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.743
That's it. It's over.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.245
This is our life now.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.948
This is where Rick got us.

25:10.050 --> 25:14.009
Maybe if Rick thought
it through,

25:14.179 --> 25:15.760
it would've been different.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.012
(thudding)

25:22.187 --> 25:24.143
People might still be with us.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.614
This is where we are.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.443
We just got to learn
to live with it.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.777
(clatters)

25:39.996 --> 25:40.985
Rosita!

25:44.626 --> 25:47.789
You know what today is, Rick?
Today is a banner day.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.328
Yes, it is.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.621
I think this
little arrangement

25:50.799 --> 25:53.632
we have is gonna work out
just fine.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.918
Hold up.

25:58.473 --> 26:02.216
Let's see if you've been
taking care of my guns.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.103
(gun cocks)

26:13.989 --> 26:15.900
(gunshot, glass shatters)

26:18.034 --> 26:21.117
(chuckles)

26:21.288 --> 26:22.949
Feels good.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.079
Sounds good!

26:25.250 --> 26:29.289
Oh, I do believe Lucille's
gettin' a little jealous.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.915
Well, ho-ly smokes!

26:36.386 --> 26:39.378
Look at this!

26:39.556 --> 26:41.512
It was you guys
that took out Little Timmy

26:41.683 --> 26:42.798
and the Dick Brigade?

26:42.976 --> 26:44.841
Wow, Rick.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.262
Gettin' in your last licks.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.977
Ooh, man, I'm gonna have
some fun with this.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.437
Please,
l-l don't know for--

26:56.698 --> 26:59.314
Arat, we don't do that

26:59.492 --> 27:02.529
unless they do somethin'
to deserve it.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.740
Yeah, we went through
the inventory.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.371
Guns in the armory,
guns they had around the walls,

27:07.542 --> 27:08.657
they're short.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.577
Glock 9 and a .22 Bobcat.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.835
Is that true?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.387
We had some people
leave town.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.718
Those guns probably
went with them.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.884
So Olivia sucks
at herjob.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.720
No.
No, I'm not sayin' that.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.139
There should be a full
accounting here, right?

27:32.317 --> 27:35.059
Top to bottom.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.522
-Am I right?
- No.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.939
I mean, yes.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.823
The inventory is correct.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.200
Good.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.697
But not so good, too.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.116
You see, what's in here...

27:51.294 --> 27:55.708
isn't in there.
You're two handguns short.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.292
Do you know
where they are?

27:58.927 --> 27:59.916
No. I...

28:00.095 --> 28:01.505
(Negan sighs)

28:04.516 --> 28:05.881
That's disappointing, Rick.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.175
I thought that we had
an understanding.

28:08.353 --> 28:13.518
But this-- well, this shows
that someone's not on board,

28:13.692 --> 28:15.978
and I can't have that.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.282
ldon't enjoy
killing women.

28:24.452 --> 28:29.367
Men, I can waste them
all the live long.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.123
But at the end of the day,
Olivia, my dear,

28:32.293 --> 28:34.079
this was
your responsibility.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.712
- Look, we can work this out.
- Oh, yes, we can.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.840
And I'm going to--
right now.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.050
(whimpering)

28:46.224 --> 28:49.637
This was yourjob,
and you screwed up.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.599
Keeping track of guns?

28:53.773 --> 28:56.731
(whimpers)

28:56.901 --> 28:59.153
That shit...

28:59.320 --> 29:01.811
is life and death.

29:14.294 --> 29:17.661
lthought about
hiding some of the guns.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.751
I did it before.

29:20.925 --> 29:25.089
I figured I could bury
some out there.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.969
Maybe we don't touch them
for years.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.505
Years?

29:28.683 --> 29:33.017
Yeah. That's right.

29:33.188 --> 29:37.932
But what if the Saviors
find those guns?

29:38.109 --> 29:40.600
What if we run into them
when we have those guns on us?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.770
One of us dies.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.815
Maybe more than that.
Maybe a lot more.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.111
Doesn't matter how many bullets
we have.

29:53.541 --> 29:54.997
It isn't enough.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.961
They win.
It's that black-and-white.

30:02.217 --> 30:06.426
Hiding a couple of guns
isn't the answer, not anymore.

30:06.596 --> 30:10.339
We don't have to like it,

30:10.517 --> 30:14.226
but we need
to give them over.

30:15.271 --> 30:19.014
A Glock 9 and a .22.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.730
That's what they're looking for.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.644
Who has it?

30:26.241 --> 30:28.072
Someone knows where they are

30:28.243 --> 30:31.280
or they know who does.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.657
If we don't find them,
they're gonna kill Olivia.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.160
They'll do it.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.122
Why do they care?

30:45.426 --> 30:47.678
Two guns aren't a threat
to them.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.336
But those guns
could help protect us

30:49.514 --> 30:51.425
from whatever else
is out there.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.554
Do you have 'em?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.138
Wish I did.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.682
Rick:
Most of you weren't there.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.317
You didn't have to watch.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.399
But you can look away now
when someone else dies,

31:07.574 --> 31:10.316
or you can help solve this.

31:11.327 --> 31:15.991
We give them what they want,
and we live in peace.

31:16.165 --> 31:18.907
(whispering)
Don't.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.167
Now is not the time.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.328
(whispers)
It is.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.008
Say we find the guns.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.087
How are we gonna get out
of this, Rick?

31:32.265 --> 31:35.473
There is no way
out of this.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.436
Let me put this to all of you
as clearly as I can.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.641
I'm not in charge anymore.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.525
Neganis.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.234
Now, who has the guns?

32:08.176 --> 32:09.791
Not everyone's here.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.220
(walkers growling)

32:36.537 --> 32:37.617
Spencer: Rosita!

32:37.789 --> 32:38.778
Where are you?!

32:38.957 --> 32:40.493
(growling intensifies)

32:51.386 --> 32:53.047
(grunts)

33:01.270 --> 33:03.431
(growling continues)

33:12.073 --> 33:14.906
(growling)

33:19.789 --> 33:20.869
(grunting)

33:21.040 --> 33:22.450
(groans)

33:27.422 --> 33:29.959
(panting)

33:30.133 --> 33:31.543
(spits)

33:32.927 --> 33:34.633
Rosita!

33:38.891 --> 33:40.472
So that's why
you're out here?

33:40.643 --> 33:42.474
They killed Denise.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.681
(speaks Spanish)

33:44.856 --> 33:46.596
It's empty.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.932
So what if it was full?

33:49.110 --> 33:50.350
What could you do with it?

33:50.528 --> 33:52.484
Don't you get it?

33:52.655 --> 33:54.611
That asshole back there
took our guns

33:54.782 --> 33:56.818
because he's gonna take
all our guns.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.860
What?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.744
What are you gonna do,
tell them?

34:06.085 --> 34:07.325
(scoffs)

34:10.339 --> 34:12.796
This is not our life.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.730
(floorboard creaks)

34:37.283 --> 34:38.443
(sighs shakily)

34:56.094 --> 34:58.050
Father Gabriel:
Nothing.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.052
Still.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.056
ljust...

35:04.143 --> 35:05.679
I feel like...

35:07.980 --> 35:10.392
I know this is going
to work out.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.645
How?

35:13.820 --> 35:15.811
We'll find the guns.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.274
We'll get through today.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.030
Then we'll find a way
to go forward,

35:20.201 --> 35:21.407
how to beat this.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.566
There is no beating this.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.862
Yes, there is, somehow.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.624
l have faith in us.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.581
l have faith in you.

35:32.755 --> 35:35.087
Things change.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.543
You're my friend.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.924
It...

35:39.095 --> 35:40.710
wasn't always that way.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.596
Where's Michonne?
Could she possibly have--

35:47.770 --> 35:50.147
She doesn't have anything
they're lookin' for.

35:52.483 --> 35:56.271
What you did with the graves,
it was quick thinkin'.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.026
Thank you.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.523
It was nice digging a grave
I knew would stay empty.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.191
No luck?

36:07.874 --> 36:10.115
We searched the house,
Rosita's.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.409
There's nothing.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.044
So what do we do now?

36:15.214 --> 36:18.832
If they were anywhere,
they'd be here.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.467
Spencer's done this kind
of thing before.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.174
We keep looking.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.555
Maybe today works out.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.136
I'll check the garage.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.721
I'll look in Deanna's
office again.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.977
(sighs)

36:38.321 --> 36:39.527
(floorboard creaks)

37:33.209 --> 37:36.417
(door opens, closes)

37:36.587 --> 37:38.669
Man: Balloons?

37:38.839 --> 37:41.251
You going to a party,
little girl?

37:41.425 --> 37:43.416
Can I keep them, please?

37:43.594 --> 37:46.176
(bird chirps)

37:46.347 --> 37:49.464
It's just...

37:49.642 --> 37:50.677
let me keep them.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.178
Say please again,
little girl.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.147
Please.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.185
Yeah.
One more time.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.570
(chuckles)

38:04.740 --> 38:06.480
(sharply)
Please.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.619
Be careful, little girl.

38:18.546 --> 38:19.786
They'll be gone soon.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.171
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

38:26.721 --> 38:29.428
What you got for me, Rick?

38:29.598 --> 38:31.805
(breathes deeply)

38:31.976 --> 38:34.262
(chuckles)

38:34.437 --> 38:36.849
Well, would you look
at that?

38:37.023 --> 38:39.890
They were here after all.

38:40.067 --> 38:43.025
Funny how a little "Holy shit!
Somebody's gonna die!"

38:43.195 --> 38:45.686
lights a fire
under everybody's ass!

38:45.865 --> 38:47.105
(Olivia whimpering)

38:47.283 --> 38:51.447
So, tell me, Rick--
which one of your fine folks

38:51.620 --> 38:53.906
almost cost Olivia
the rest of her days?

38:55.207 --> 38:57.584
- It doesn't matter anymore.
- No, it matters.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.327
See, you need to get
everybody on board.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.087
Everybody.
Or...

39:05.426 --> 39:07.963
we just go right back
to square one.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.306
(door rattles, slams)

39:21.525 --> 39:23.265
(brakes squeal)

39:26.989 --> 39:28.525
(engine idling)

39:33.662 --> 39:35.527
(engine shuts off)

39:49.929 --> 39:52.011
(brakes squeal,
engine shuts off)

39:59.522 --> 40:01.979
Hell of a place
you got here, Rick.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.242
Give me a second.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.286
No.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.667
Please, can you just...

40:27.842 --> 40:30.254
give me a second?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.619
He had me hold it.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.832
I need the rifle.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.747
What?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.217
I know it's in the bag.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.631
I know what you're doing
out there.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.221
What am I doing out there?

41:21.395 --> 41:23.556
You're practicing.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.268
We have to give up our guns,
all of them.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.853
We can't.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.735
If you keep it,
and they find it,

41:31.906 --> 41:34.397
someone dies.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.736
I'm not losing you or Carl
or anyone else.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.618
I'm not losing anyone else!

41:46.587 --> 41:48.452
Now I'm giving it to them.
Are you gonna let me?

41:55.262 --> 41:58.299
(humming)

42:04.980 --> 42:06.971
Look at this!

42:09.818 --> 42:10.898
Rick: I thought she was
scavenging.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.731
She was hunting.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.989
This one never came inside.
We kept it near the line.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.109
Look at this.

42:21.413 --> 42:25.156
This is something to build
a relationship on.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.454
Good for you, Rick.

42:28.629 --> 42:32.121
This is readin' the room
and gettin' the message.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.711
I've said it before,
I'm gonna say it again.

42:34.885 --> 42:38.503
You, sir, are special.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.798
Now that you know we can
follow your rules...

42:42.977 --> 42:44.968
Yes?

42:48.774 --> 42:51.311
...l'd like to ask you
if Daryl can stay.

42:51.485 --> 42:52.600
Not happenin'.

42:56.365 --> 43:00.483
You know what?
I don't know.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.993
Maybe Daryl
can plead his case.

43:03.163 --> 43:07.281
Maybe Daryl can sway me.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.001
Daryl?

43:20.806 --> 43:22.671
(chuckles)

43:22.850 --> 43:25.057
Well, you tried.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.967
Now what you got to do

43:27.146 --> 43:29.888
is get over
that tall wall of yours

43:30.065 --> 43:32.727
and try harder out there.

43:32.901 --> 43:34.277
Earn for me.

43:34.445 --> 43:38.313
Because we're coming back soon,
and when we do,

43:38.490 --> 43:41.197
you better have something
interesting for us,

43:41.368 --> 43:44.360
or Lucille,
she's gonna have her way.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.864
I want you
to hear that again.

43:48.042 --> 43:53.207
If you don't have something
interesting for us...

43:54.256 --> 43:55.996
somebody's gonna die.

43:57.217 --> 43:59.594
And no more magic guns.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.388
Arat, grab that deer.
It's getting late.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.843
Let's go home.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.679
(carcass thuds)

44:11.273 --> 44:14.765
Man, I love a gal
that buys me dinner

44:14.943 --> 44:17.480
and doesn't expect me
to put out.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.317
(chuckles)

44:24.244 --> 44:26.235
I'll take that.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.454
Got a little thank-you.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.208
That's all
you're getting back.

44:40.386 --> 44:44.129
Took all your guns,
most of your beds.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.717
I hope you find a place to lay
your pretty little head.

44:49.895 --> 44:52.011
(chuckles)

44:52.189 --> 44:56.273
Did you find anything else
out there?

44:56.443 --> 44:58.399
Just your dead friends.

44:58.570 --> 45:01.778
(chuckles)

45:01.949 --> 45:04.691
(engine starts, revs)

45:16.422 --> 45:18.504
(engine idling)

45:19.967 --> 45:21.798
You can have it back.

45:23.887 --> 45:25.138
Just say the word.

45:30.644 --> 45:32.350
(engine revving)

45:38.152 --> 45:40.939
So, nobody died.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.354
And you know
what I think?

45:43.532 --> 45:46.695
I think you and I,
we've refined our understanding.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.320
Let me ask you
something, Rick.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.489
Do you want me to go?

45:59.047 --> 46:01.174
I think that'd be good.

46:01.341 --> 46:05.584
Then just say those two
magical words.

46:11.935 --> 46:14.426
Thank you.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.266
(chuckles)

46:16.440 --> 46:19.932
Don't be ridiculous.
Thank you.

46:23.906 --> 46:27.524
(walker growling in distance)

46:27.701 --> 46:29.032
Another one.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.409
(growling continues)

46:30.579 --> 46:32.786
You need our help.

46:32.956 --> 46:36.574
Davey, hand me that candlestick
over there.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.786
You know what
lthink, Rick?

46:40.964 --> 46:44.877
I think we're both gonna
come out of this winners.

46:45.052 --> 46:46.667
Watch my form!

46:46.845 --> 46:48.426
(walker growling)

47:04.321 --> 47:06.357
(flesh squelching)

47:06.532 --> 47:08.773
Ahh.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.832
Yep.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.836
Win-win.

47:24.675 --> 47:25.960
(candlestick clatters)

47:26.134 --> 47:28.876
You should clean that up for me
for next time.

47:30.305 --> 47:31.636
Let's move out!

47:34.935 --> 47:37.517
Oh, wait.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.397
(chuckles)

47:41.567 --> 47:44.900
How careless of me.

47:45.070 --> 47:47.231
You didn't think I was gonna
leave Lucille, did ya?

47:47.406 --> 47:51.524
I mean,
after what she did,

47:51.702 --> 47:53.784
why would you want 'er?

47:54.913 --> 47:58.246
Thank you for being
so accommodating, friend.

48:02.921 --> 48:05.082
In case you
haven't caught on...

48:06.258 --> 48:08.965
I just slipped my dick
down your throat,

48:09.136 --> 48:11.969
and you thanked me for it.

48:20.147 --> 48:22.308
(engine starts)

49:11.448 --> 49:13.439
(gate creaking)

49:39.393 --> 49:41.600
Rick: Spencer.

49:41.770 --> 49:44.682
We took the guns
you had in your house.

49:44.856 --> 49:48.644
The Saviors wanted ours,
all of them.

49:48.819 --> 49:50.730
There were two missing
from the inventory.

49:52.739 --> 49:55.116
They were gonna
kill Olivia.

49:57.828 --> 50:01.116
Spencen

50:01.289 --> 50:03.200
You went into my house?

50:04.418 --> 50:07.080
They were gonna
kill Olivia.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.621
Look, I'm not faulting you
for having the guns.

50:10.799 --> 50:14.041
I did it myself.
But the food and liquor?

50:14.219 --> 50:16.084
(sighs)

50:16.263 --> 50:18.504
That's 'cause you're small,
Spencen

50:18.682 --> 50:20.138
You're weak.

50:20.308 --> 50:22.390
You got lucky
with the walls.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.142
You got lucky with us.

50:27.441 --> 50:30.148
We should've made a deal
with them when we could've.

50:32.612 --> 50:34.352
Oh, yeah, we're so lucky.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.112
You've led us all
to the Promised Land!

50:36.283 --> 50:37.864
Isn't that right, Rick?!

50:38.035 --> 50:40.367
Here we are!

50:40.537 --> 50:44.280
I guess Glenn and Abraham
were lucky, too?

50:49.796 --> 50:53.505
You say anything
like that again to me,

50:53.675 --> 50:56.257
I'll break yourjaw,
knock your teeth out.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.963
You understand?

51:01.141 --> 51:02.722
Say yes.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.350
Yes.

51:20.368 --> 51:21.778
You had guns?

51:21.953 --> 51:23.409
Uh-huh.

51:23.580 --> 51:26.367
Why didn't you tell me
after l--

51:26.541 --> 51:29.328
You saw what I did
to get one,

51:29.503 --> 51:30.492
that I need bullets.

51:30.670 --> 51:32.501
I had them for a while

51:32.672 --> 51:34.583
because I didn't
trust Rick.

51:37.177 --> 51:40.840
'Cause I was worried about him
being in charge.

51:41.014 --> 51:42.845
You know what?
You were right.

51:43.016 --> 51:46.099
This doesn't have to be our life.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.607
(engine starts)

51:57.489 --> 51:59.445
(vehicle drives off)

52:40.031 --> 52:43.899
They took our mattresses,
most of them.

52:49.583 --> 52:51.869
That rifle

52:52.043 --> 52:54.034
was one of theirs
from the outpost.

52:54.212 --> 52:55.952
They didn't have a list?

52:57.632 --> 52:59.418
Unh-unh.

52:59.593 --> 53:01.584
Could've hidden more.

53:01.761 --> 53:04.468
Did you?

53:09.561 --> 53:11.142
(sighs)

53:11.313 --> 53:12.894
No.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.619
Everything we have,
we got from fighting.

53:29.789 --> 53:33.156
I made the choice.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.326
There aren't enough of us.
It's about numbers.

53:35.503 --> 53:36.629
There's the Hilltop.

53:36.796 --> 53:40.129
They'd still have
the numbers.

53:42.636 --> 53:46.128
We play by their rules,
and we get some kind of life.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.422
What kind of a life?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.010
(sighs)

53:53.563 --> 53:55.804
You know,
I had a friend.

53:59.736 --> 54:02.102
I don't talk about him.

54:03.573 --> 54:06.155
He was my partner.

54:06.326 --> 54:10.740
He got Lori and Carl to safety
right after it all started.

54:14.334 --> 54:16.165
I couldn't.
I was in the hospital.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.622
I-I didn't know
what was happenin'.

54:21.049 --> 54:23.290
My friend...

54:23.468 --> 54:25.880
his name was Shane.

54:29.182 --> 54:33.721
Well, him and Lori...

54:33.895 --> 54:35.806
they were together.

54:37.691 --> 54:39.932
They thought I was dead.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.436
I know Judith isn't mine.

54:46.324 --> 54:48.315
I know it.

54:49.577 --> 54:51.442
(breathes deeply)

54:51.621 --> 54:53.361
I love her.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.407
She's my daughter.

54:56.584 --> 54:59.200
But she isn't mine.

54:59.379 --> 55:02.337
I had to accept that.

55:02.507 --> 55:05.214
Idid.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.751
So I could keep her alive.

55:12.225 --> 55:13.726
I'll die before she does,

55:13.893 --> 55:15.849
and I hope that's
a long time from now

55:16.021 --> 55:17.807
so I can...

55:17.981 --> 55:21.314
raise her and protect her
and teach her how to survive.

55:25.447 --> 55:28.814
This is how we live now.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.448
I had to accept that, too,

55:30.618 --> 55:32.404
so I could keep
everyone else alive.

55:32.579 --> 55:35.161
It's not your fault
when people die.

55:35.332 --> 55:39.450
Not always, but sometimes--
sometimes it is.

55:42.255 --> 55:45.873
You have to accept this.

55:46.051 --> 55:47.257
All of us do.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.383
Or it won't work.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.825
I'm gonna try.

56:23.797 --> 56:26.789
(insect buzzing)

57:56.222 --> 57:59.134
(breathing heavily)

58:37.430 --> 58:39.295
Make me a bullet.

58:44.687 --> 58:47.679
