WEBVTT

00:10.103 --> 00:13.344
If Sam did come here, like,
what would it have been like
for you two?

00:13.413 --> 00:15.689
I have a kid on the way.
You think I give a
what she does?

00:15.758 --> 00:17.000
There would've been a divide
in the house.

00:17.068 --> 00:18.448
Ha ha, look at him smile.

00:18.517 --> 00:20.586
Spiraling.
Oh, man.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.241
I've never seen a night start
with Ron-Ron juice

00:22.310 --> 00:24.310
and end well for Ron-Ron.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.172
This  is gonna get
to his girlfriend.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.482
You can get me
into a lot of trouble.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.206
And she's going to cut
his balls off.

00:39.172 --> 00:41.620

let's party ♪

00:41.689 --> 00:43.931
Yeah, buddy!

The Situation
is under construction.

00:49.034 --> 00:51.448
This might not have been
the best idea.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.965
We're so classy now.

00:54.034 --> 00:56.172
On the seventh day,
it'll be lit.

00:56.241 --> 00:58.655

! Ronnie, come on.

01:22.689 --> 01:24.758
He's making a bad decision
he's gonna regret later,

01:24.827 --> 01:25.793
and I don't want him
to do that.

01:27.206 --> 01:28.965
Yo, Ron.No, thank you.

01:33.862 --> 01:35.241
Yeah.

01:50.586 --> 01:51.931
I'ma send her home, okay?Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.034
I just wanna talk to her
real quick.

01:53.103 --> 01:54.379
Nah, nah, nah.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.241
Bro. Bro!

01:57.310 --> 01:59.241
What the
are you thinking?

02:08.586 --> 02:11.344
Damn.

02:11.413 --> 02:13.413
Ronnie is thinking
with his head right now.

02:13.482 --> 02:15.517
It's just not the right head.

02:15.586 --> 02:16.862
This guy goes
from telling us

02:16.931 --> 02:18.724
that he's
having a baby mama

02:18.793 --> 02:22.551
to inviting a girl that he was
grinding with back to the house.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.103
I don't know what
he's thinking, honestly.

02:24.172 --> 02:25.862
Night, French fries.

02:25.931 --> 02:26.862
Good night.

02:26.931 --> 02:28.448
Temptation in Miami
is real.

02:28.517 --> 02:31.724
Oh, .
That girl got no clothes on.

02:31.793 --> 02:33.448
I don't know if she's hot,
or just naked.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.275
Bro, you had temptation
and you said no.

02:35.344 --> 02:36.275
The blue?
Oh, yeah.

02:36.344 --> 02:37.551
That was the ultimate test.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.862
Did he cheat?

02:38.931 --> 02:40.896
Uhh, what's your
definition of cheating?

02:40.965 --> 02:42.448
I didn't see anything.

02:42.517 --> 02:43.965
Touching.

02:44.034 --> 02:47.000
He was touching her
in the club.

02:47.068 --> 02:49.034
Ron's, like,
in a load of .

02:49.103 --> 02:50.896
Like, worse than the
in the  toilet.

02:50.965 --> 02:53.068
This is, like, bad .

03:02.137 --> 03:04.586
Yeah. Yeah.

03:04.655 --> 03:05.758
.

03:05.827 --> 03:07.310
He's a savage.

03:07.379 --> 03:08.758
When he sees,
like, the titties,
he's an animal.

03:08.827 --> 03:09.862
He can't help it.

03:12.517 --> 03:14.137
Okay.
Get home safe.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.931
We had a little party,
whatever.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.827
We had fun in the hot tub
with Syd, but that was it.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.172
He should've said bye too.

03:22.241 --> 03:24.310
How'd that go?

03:24.379 --> 03:25.896
Thank you.Sorry about that.

03:25.965 --> 03:27.206
I ha...Yeah, I get it.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.758
Ron's decisions are like
multiple choice.

03:29.827 --> 03:31.655
It's like "A," bad decision.

03:31.724 --> 03:33.517
"B," really bad decision.

03:33.586 --> 03:36.103
And "C,"  it up
and destroy it.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.448
And that's all he chooses
every single time.

03:38.517 --> 03:41.655
Thank you for...

03:41.724 --> 03:44.517
Yeah.
Not letting me do...

03:44.586 --> 03:46.344
Yeah, I mean...
What you would normally do?

03:46.413 --> 03:48.482
You can do what you wanna do,
but it's not worth it.

03:48.551 --> 03:49.689
Those titties were hypnotizing.Oh, my God.

03:49.758 --> 03:51.931
Hell yeah. French fries?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.379
I was finna put
some ketchup on them.

03:54.448 --> 03:55.965
As soon as you knocked
on the door,

03:56.034 --> 03:58.172
I'm like,
"This is not a good move."

03:58.241 --> 03:59.344
Yeah.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.586
It felt so good though.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.793
It's hard to just constantly
say, "No, no, no, no, no,"

04:06.862 --> 04:10.551
when it's like every girl in
the club wants to talk to you.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.137
So it's like being
in the money machine

04:12.206 --> 04:13.448
and the money's just flying
everywhere, like,

04:13.517 --> 04:14.827
and you're just trying
to grab all of it.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.172
That's what it's like.

04:16.241 --> 04:17.724
Like, you're just gonna
stand there like this?

04:17.793 --> 04:19.862
No, you're gonna try to
grab all the money.

04:19.931 --> 04:21.517
I was just trying
to be nice.

04:21.586 --> 04:23.000
I was like,
"Yeah, everyone come."

04:26.655 --> 04:28.379
I saved you from that moment
of you saying,

04:28.448 --> 04:29.689
"Why the
did I do that?"

04:29.758 --> 04:31.689
It's harder having,
like, a kid on the way

04:31.758 --> 04:33.448
and, like, being with someone
that you're not sure

04:33.517 --> 04:35.241
that, like,
you should be with.

04:35.310 --> 04:36.724
Like, it's--Yeah, you're in a...

04:36.793 --> 04:38.137
Especially with all the--
like, come on, bro.

04:38.206 --> 04:39.379
...a tempting situation.

04:39.448 --> 04:40.827
All tonight, like,
come on, like...

04:40.896 --> 04:42.689
I don't think just because

04:42.758 --> 04:44.034
you're having a kid
with her,

04:44.103 --> 04:46.413
she's necessarily
the one for you.

04:46.482 --> 04:47.931
So then why am I having
this conversation with you

04:48.000 --> 04:49.241
and not getting my
sucked in the bathroom?

04:49.310 --> 04:50.827
Because right now
you're not--

04:50.896 --> 04:52.310
You haven't
established that yet.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.137
You should--
she needs the respect first.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.862
Maybe you're ready
to have the child,

04:55.931 --> 04:57.103
but you're not ready
to get married.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.241
For a relationship, no.
No, I'm not.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.068
I'm not.

05:01.137 --> 05:03.000
Absolutely not, no.

05:06.965 --> 05:08.931
The diapers are just
getting tighter

05:09.000 --> 05:10.344
and tighter and tighter on me,

05:10.413 --> 05:13.000
and I'm just,
kind of just scared.

05:13.068 --> 05:15.724
A lot has happened
in the last six months.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.482
I found out that I'm having
a child with Jen,

05:18.551 --> 05:21.896
and it's like,
I have a baby shower coming.

05:21.965 --> 05:23.862
A lot of
to take on

05:23.931 --> 05:26.379
in just a matter of six
or seven months, like, you know?

05:26.448 --> 05:28.172
People deal with this stuff
throughout years,

05:28.241 --> 05:31.551
and I'm getting it just,
like, thrown at me.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.241
Whatever the problem is,
the solution is not for you

05:34.310 --> 05:37.413
to stray and to get
with other girls.

05:37.482 --> 05:40.068
Figure out what the
you wanna do with her,

05:40.137 --> 05:41.517
if you wanna be with her
or not.

05:41.586 --> 05:43.827
If not, you raise the kid
from a distance

05:43.896 --> 05:45.482
or whatever the  it is.And that's totally fine.

05:45.551 --> 05:46.586
That's totally fine.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.448
I don't know what I want.

05:48.517 --> 05:50.413
I don't know if I'm ready
for this yet,

05:50.482 --> 05:52.586
but, um, I hope that me and Jen
will work out, you know,

05:52.655 --> 05:56.103
for my own sanity,
for the baby's sanity,

05:56.172 --> 05:58.000
for not being raised
in a broken home.

05:58.068 --> 06:00.000
My parents weren't together,
you know?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.758
I've learned
from their mistakes.

06:01.827 --> 06:03.275
Ron, you'll figure it out.

06:03.344 --> 06:06.310
I'm going up.
I can't even stand anymore.

06:06.379 --> 06:08.655
How long do you think
it's gonna last?

06:08.724 --> 06:10.172
Real talk.It should...

06:10.241 --> 06:12.827
It should last always
'cause you're having a baby.

06:12.896 --> 06:14.344
Are you not gonna
propose to her?

06:14.413 --> 06:15.827
No.

06:15.896 --> 06:17.827
You don't wanna
propose to her?No.

06:17.896 --> 06:19.965
I thought you were in love.

06:20.034 --> 06:22.068
So she's not the one then?

06:24.275 --> 06:26.275
I mean, probably not, right?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.586
This is, like, new news to me,
because before we came here,

06:28.655 --> 06:30.655
me and Ron were, like, talking
about it and we were like,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.551
"Oh, he's so happy.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.620
Like, he found a girl
that trusts him

06:34.689 --> 06:37.068
and they get along,
they don't fight."

06:37.137 --> 06:40.344
So Ron telling me this
right now, I'm like,
I don't get it.

06:40.413 --> 06:41.862
You look depressed.

06:41.931 --> 06:44.413
You know that I
was raised the right way

06:44.482 --> 06:49.379
and, like, had waited so long
not to have kids--

06:49.448 --> 06:51.896
so that I am married,
you know?

06:51.965 --> 06:54.586
And, like,
in a happy relationship.

06:54.655 --> 06:58.689
Like, not to just have
a baby's mama.

06:58.758 --> 07:01.103
But you could work on it.

07:01.172 --> 07:04.000
Why are you being
so  negative?

07:04.068 --> 07:05.655
I get it.
He's, like, freaking out.

07:05.724 --> 07:08.482
But, like, Ron, just stop.
You're having a baby.

07:08.551 --> 07:09.655
I'm, like, so traditional.

07:09.724 --> 07:11.896
Like, I want him
to get married to her

07:11.965 --> 07:14.448
and have, like, a picket fence
because that's what I did.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.137
I just-- that's what I know.
That's, like, the Italian way.

07:17.206 --> 07:19.965
This is not the Ron I know.
What is wrong with you?

07:20.034 --> 07:22.137
What the  happened
to you?

07:22.206 --> 07:25.827
You're being so negative.
Why can't you marry this bitch?

07:33.724 --> 07:35.965
'Cause you
love Sam.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.310
I can't.

07:40.379 --> 07:43.103
Listen.
You need to stop.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.413
Stop.

07:44.482 --> 07:46.655
Every man wishes that, like,

07:46.724 --> 07:49.482
he can be with the love
of his life.

07:49.551 --> 07:50.827
Being with someone
for seven years,

07:50.896 --> 07:53.275
and then you don't end up
with that person?

07:53.344 --> 07:54.413
Yeah, it hurts.

07:54.482 --> 07:57.034
Oh, my God, babe.
Get over Sam.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.137
It's been
ten years.

07:59.206 --> 08:01.620
What the ?
Why are we still talking
about this?

08:01.689 --> 08:05.620
I think I just miss
the feeling of, like, security

08:05.689 --> 08:07.793
'cause that's what
she gave, you know?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.137
Like, that's so
hard to find.

08:10.206 --> 08:13.862
And I feel like that's
why I am the way I am.

08:13.931 --> 08:16.965
And, like, I'll continue
to be the way I am

08:17.034 --> 08:18.275
because it's like...

08:18.344 --> 08:19.965
Do you not feel that
with Jen?

08:20.034 --> 08:21.344
No, I don't trust her
for .

08:21.413 --> 08:22.827
I don't.
Stop.

08:22.896 --> 08:24.482
You're having a baby
with someone else.

08:24.551 --> 08:25.827
Move on.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.689
Like, Sam moved on,
so you should as well.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.000
And just stop
talking about her.

08:29.068 --> 08:32.655
So all I can do is act happy

08:32.724 --> 08:35.275
and be the best father
I can be,

08:35.344 --> 08:40.724
and, like, end of the day,
I'm still  miserable.

08:40.793 --> 08:42.931
Can I be real with you?Yeah.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.344
I  love you,
but you need to get
your  together.

I'm making Ron
What?

09:29.344 --> 09:31.862
I'm making Ron-Ron juice.
We're gonna watch the sunset.

09:31.931 --> 09:32.965
All right, let's do it.

09:33.034 --> 09:34.344
I'm not tired.

09:34.413 --> 09:36.724
I don't wanna go to sleep.
I'm drunk right now.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.793
Ron's up.
Let's get a drink.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.793
Let's just forget what happened
and let's move on.

09:41.862 --> 09:43.862
We're doing, like,

09:43.931 --> 09:46.275
We didn't sleep.
I've never done that
in my life.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.379
Oh, God,
that girl's still here.

09:50.448 --> 09:51.758
Hey, sweetie,
you all right?

09:51.827 --> 09:53.000
Good?

09:53.068 --> 09:54.689
Like, I'm gonna call you
a cab.

09:54.758 --> 09:56.206

10:03.068 --> 10:04.827

that I didn't even smash.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.793
Hey, good morning.
Um, I would like a taxi please.

10:13.827 --> 10:16.758
Sweetie, hey.
Do

10:16.827 --> 10:19.655
Yeah, I'm not gonna let the girl
walk out of the house

10:19.724 --> 10:22.275
with, like, no shorts on.

10:22.344 --> 10:24.448
Yeah, there was like a--They actually fit me.

10:24.517 --> 10:26.517
Yeah. That's great.They were Sam's.

10:26.586 --> 10:28.448
Boom. Magic.

10:28.517 --> 10:29.896
I figured Sam wasn't using them,

10:29.965 --> 10:31.724
we might as well
let her use them.

10:31.793 --> 10:33.724
Here. This never happened.

10:33.793 --> 10:36.413
Ugh, like,
she threw up in her hair

10:36.482 --> 10:38.310
and she, like, touched my hair,
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

10:38.379 --> 10:39.310
That's why I hugged her
like this.

10:39.379 --> 10:40.551
I went...

10:43.827 --> 10:46.275
Right now, me and Nicole are up
enjoying the sunset.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.758
Or sunrise?

10:47.827 --> 10:49.103
Still can't figure out
which one it is.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.517

11:08.379 --> 11:09.793
It's like 8:30.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.620
Ron needed, like,
a talking friend.

he's still in love with Sam.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.965

20:40.965 --> 20:42.206
Ooh!

20:42.275 --> 20:44.137
Oh, you been holding
that one in!

20:44.206 --> 20:47.448
Mike, you've been snoring
for six houses straight.

20:47.517 --> 20:49.068
Half the time,
I thought you were dying.

20:49.137 --> 20:50.241
Well, tables have turned,

20:50.310 --> 20:51.551
because now it looks
like you are.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.379
Ohh!

20:53.448 --> 20:57.482
Oh! Oh! Oh!

20:57.551 --> 20:59.310
Oh!
Oh!

20:59.379 --> 21:00.620
Oh!

21:00.689 --> 21:02.620
Yo, Mike is coming out swinging.
What is happening?

21:02.689 --> 21:04.344
Yes.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.620
He's like-- he's got
some ammunition.
Yeah.

21:06.689 --> 21:08.586
Yo, he's been waiting
for the perfect moment.Comin' out  hot.

21:08.655 --> 21:10.413
That's what happens
when you don't talk
for six years.

21:10.482 --> 21:13.620
Ohh!

21:13.689 --> 21:16.000
Mike, I know you got
another one loaded up.

21:16.068 --> 21:18.034
You are fake news.

21:18.103 --> 21:19.758
Wait, what does
"fake news" mean?

21:19.827 --> 21:21.482
That means, like, whatever comes
out of your mouth is suspect.

21:21.551 --> 21:23.689
Ohh!

21:27.931 --> 21:29.379
Wait! No, wait!

21:29.448 --> 21:32.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you talking about suspect?

21:32.862 --> 21:34.827
It takes a suspect
to know a suspect,
huh, Mike?

21:34.896 --> 21:36.724
Ohh!

21:36.793 --> 21:38.206
Yo, everyone!

21:38.275 --> 21:39.551
You got another one.

21:39.620 --> 21:40.689
I got one in the chamber.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.310
Oh! Oh!

21:42.379 --> 21:44.689
If you have ever seen
Ronald's license,

21:44.758 --> 21:46.758
where it says "class,"
it says "none."

21:46.827 --> 21:50.310
Ohh! Oh! Oh!

21:50.379 --> 21:52.689
Yo, when you look
at Mike's passport--

21:52.758 --> 21:55.206
Oh, that's right, you can't,
'cause he doesn't have it.

21:55.275 --> 21:57.551
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!Oh, !

21:57.620 --> 21:59.482
Right?
Am I wrong?

21:59.551 --> 22:01.103
Right
I don't know.

22:01.172 --> 22:02.448
I pay my taxes.

22:02.517 --> 22:04.551
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.758
All I gotta say to that is...Wait, wait!

22:06.827 --> 22:08.379
"Ron, stop!"

22:08.448 --> 22:10.068

22:14.793 --> 22:16.827
if it wasn't me
taking her from you,

22:16.896 --> 22:18.206
you would've been
stuck with her.

22:18.275 --> 22:19.310
Ohh!

Uh-huh.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.137
Randomly?Yeah.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.689
How'd you meet Lauren?

25:08.758 --> 25:10.482
Uh, when we were in college,
obviously when we were younger.

25:10.551 --> 25:11.689
Oh, she's a college sweetheart?She's my college sweetheart.

25:11.758 --> 25:13.206
Yeah, you were sweethearts.

25:13.275 --> 25:15.517
She's my only, like,
real relationship I've ever had.

25:15.586 --> 25:18.379
And I kinda craved that,
like, substance of--
of something real.

25:18.448 --> 25:19.620
Were you sober at the time?

25:19.689 --> 25:21.931
Yes, but then
I-I kind of relapsed.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.517
You relapsed
during your relationship?Yeah. Yeah.

25:23.586 --> 25:26.344
Did she help you get back
on the sobriety, like...

25:26.413 --> 25:28.344
Yeah, and that really
meant a lot to me.

25:28.413 --> 25:30.655
At any particular time,
she could've been like,

25:30.724 --> 25:32.310
"You know what, like,
I don't need to, you know,

25:32.379 --> 25:34.172
"stay here and help him
fix himself.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.482
"I'm gonna go find somebody
that's already
a finished product--

25:36.551 --> 25:38.241
so, a finished product,
so to speak."
Yeah.

25:38.310 --> 25:40.655
And then all of a sudden,
the court situation came.

25:40.724 --> 25:42.793
That was extremely hard.

25:42.862 --> 25:44.862
And she stuck by me
the whole time.

25:44.931 --> 25:46.689
She just made me
a better person.

25:46.758 --> 25:47.758
So she whipped you into shape.

25:47.827 --> 25:48.931
She definitely did.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.344
What's in the future
for you guys?

25:50.413 --> 25:51.827
I don't know
about the timing,

25:51.896 --> 25:53.827
but she's the one,
and I wanna propose to her.

25:53.896 --> 25:55.620
Whoa.

25:55.689 --> 25:56.965
'Cause it's been a while.

25:57.034 --> 25:58.965
You guys have been together
for a long time.

25:59.034 --> 26:01.103
We've known each other
for over ten years.

26:01.172 --> 26:03.068
And she stuck by your side
through everything.She stuck by my side.

26:03.137 --> 26:05.241
Yeah, but, what I loved
at Deena's wedding--

26:05.310 --> 26:07.965
'cause we were talking about,
obviously, Mike's sobriety.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.586
And I was like,
"How do you deal with it?
Like, is he okay?"

26:10.655 --> 26:12.827
And she goes, "Honestly,
I don't wanna drink around him,

26:12.896 --> 26:15.068
nor do I need to,
because I'm here for him."

26:15.137 --> 26:16.655
Aww!So she literally loves you.

26:16.724 --> 26:18.896
So she is really the best.
She is. She's awesome.

26:18.965 --> 26:21.344
I think that this is
a great thing for Mike.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.379
I think he needs
all the positivity that he can,

26:24.448 --> 26:27.034
and luckily he met
this amazing woman for him.

26:27.103 --> 26:29.482
And, uh, you know, I think
they should be together,

26:29.551 --> 26:31.655
and I'm happy that he's gonna
propose to her.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.482
Oooh!I don't know when
I'm gonna do it

26:33.551 --> 26:35.172
because of this whole
court situation.

26:35.241 --> 26:36.551
Right.

26:36.620 --> 26:37.793
I have sentencing
in a couple--

26:37.862 --> 26:39.517
in a couple months,
two, three months.

26:39.586 --> 26:42.034
'Cause there's a possibility
that I could go away.

26:42.103 --> 26:43.965
I don't know
if I wanna wait anymore,
to be honest with you.

26:44.034 --> 26:45.068
Don't.
Then just do it.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.206
Maybe, maybe you proposing
and knowing

26:47.275 --> 26:49.344
that when you get out
that you're gonna have

26:49.413 --> 26:52.000
a wedding and a wife
to come home to,

26:52.068 --> 26:54.793
it might help you
get through the process easier.

26:54.862 --> 26:58.241
Well, I do like that, but we're
not-- we're not banking on me
coming out of anywhere.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.068
We're trying to stay, stay in
No, but what I'm saying is,

27:00.137 --> 27:01.482
God forbid,
worst-case scenario.I know what you're saying, yeah.

27:01.551 --> 27:02.862
God forbid, yeah.

27:02.931 --> 27:04.965
Conjugal visits.
Worst case.
Yes!

27:05.034 --> 27:07.000
Yeah, smuggle out some sperm.
Oh, my God.

27:08.241 --> 27:09.448
Make a little baby.

27:09.517 --> 27:10.862
And you need
a baby.

27:10.931 --> 27:13.620
I want a little Situation,
immediately.
Ohh!

27:13.689 --> 27:16.965
I've always said that I'd rather
pay child support than alimony.

27:17.034 --> 27:21.206
Ohh, here it goes.
Here he goes, couple of drinks.

27:21.275 --> 27:22.862
We're having this great moment.

27:22.931 --> 27:25.000
Mike is talking about Lauren
and proposing,

27:25.068 --> 27:26.344
and then there's Ron saying

27:26.413 --> 27:29.172
he'd rather pay child support
than alimony.

27:29.241 --> 27:31.827
Like, this is why girls
punch you in the face, bro.

27:31.896 --> 27:34.482
No, no, no, I-I--
me and Jen have never
talked about marriage.

27:34.551 --> 27:35.758
It's not a discussion.

27:35.827 --> 27:38.517
It's not something
that she's pressuring me for.

27:38.586 --> 27:40.965
We're still working
on getting to know each other.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.517
How long has she
been pregnant,

27:42.586 --> 27:44.172
and, like, how long
have you been together?

27:44.241 --> 27:46.034
We've been together for a year,
and she's seven months pregnant.

27:46.103 --> 27:47.413
Oh, my God.

27:47.482 --> 27:49.413
You know, like,
I've found my best friend.

27:49.482 --> 27:51.000
I found someone
that I could have fun with

27:51.068 --> 27:53.827
and I go on vacation with,
and we joke around

27:53.896 --> 27:55.275
and, like,
we have a good time.

27:55.344 --> 27:56.862
I kinda feel like
Ronnie's confused.

27:56.931 --> 27:58.896
He kinda sends mixed messages
out there.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.103
'Cause Ronnie was just, like,

28:01.172 --> 28:02.965
in a bathroom
with a girl last night.

28:03.034 --> 28:06.103
Miami is, like, giving him
second thoughts, I feel.

28:06.172 --> 28:08.034
He needs to, like,
figure his  out

28:08.103 --> 28:10.068
with the girl
with the relationship,

28:10.137 --> 28:11.827
and just move forward
one way or the other.

28:12.931 --> 28:14.448
All right,
so it's official.

28:14.517 --> 28:16.310
Cheers to you
getting married, bitch.

28:16.379 --> 28:18.241
Cheers to Mike proposing!Cheers!

28:18.310 --> 28:19.620
Another one bites the dust!We're all getting older!

28:19.689 --> 28:21.517
Another one!Another one bites the dust.

28:21.586 --> 28:23.586
Yes!Another one's off.
