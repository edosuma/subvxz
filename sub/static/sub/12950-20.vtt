00:03.469 --> 00:05.970
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.971 --> 00:07.573
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:10.543
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.643 --> 00:12.511
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:14.346
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:16.749
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:19.250
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.386 --> 00:20.819
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:22.921
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.922 --> 00:24.823
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.824 --> 00:26.725
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.726 --> 00:28.093
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.094 --> 00:29.995
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:29.996 --> 00:31.730
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.731 --> 00:35.189
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.971
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:38.972 --> 00:41.668
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.775 --> 00:44.275
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.344 --> 00:46.844
<i>My father.</i>

00:53.420 --> 00:55.587
Do you value your life?

00:55.588 --> 00:57.756
Of course I value my life.

00:57.757 --> 01:00.257
Your actions would indicate
otherwise.

01:02.529 --> 01:06.898
Listen, Jean, this business
that we have to discuss

01:06.966 --> 01:08.333
is extremely sensitive.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.834
What is it?

01:16.843 --> 01:19.311
I know this has been
difficult for Arvin.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.974
My illness.

01:22.048 --> 01:27.213
I look just like everyone else,
and I usually feel that way.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.787
Fact is...

01:31.224 --> 01:33.724
I won't be alive next Christmas.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.992
You remember the vial of liquid
that Khasinau wanted?

01:38.064 --> 01:39.798
We used it on the blank page.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.495
It exposed Rambaldi's
hidden text.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.094
I booked you on a flight
for tomorrow night.

01:45.205 --> 01:47.705
It'll be our last mission.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.907
Noah.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.408
Let me prove to you
that it can work.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.981 --> 02:30.481
Good.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.183
I heard about Noah.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.887
I'm sorry.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.659
Come on, hit the bag.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.231
I killed a man.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.536
Someone I cared about.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.443
Noah Hicks was an assassin.

02:58.444 --> 03:01.277
If you hadn't killed him,
he would have killed you.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.148
I was the one
who forced the fight.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.649
Hicks was a bad guy.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.288
That's it.
Work that jab.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.290
Nice combination.
Move it along.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.791
Come on.
Work that jab.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.496
But the truth is, it affects me.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.831
Never knowing who to trust.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.332
Learning to expect betrayal.

03:23.303 --> 03:27.364
Plotting in secrecy
and hatred and anger.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.742
It's becoming a part of me.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.110
I am becoming what I despise.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.250
I tell myself
that I got into this

03:38.251 --> 03:41.220
to bring Danny's killers
to justice.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.481
The truth is,
I'm more interested in revenge.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.792
Power jab.
That's it.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.523
I thought I could stay
in control.

03:49.596 --> 03:53.123
It's just gotten so twisted.
Like with Khasinau.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.793
The one tangible goal I have
is to find him

03:55.868 --> 03:58.003
so that I can find my mother.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.768
But if I do that,

04:00.840 --> 04:03.570
if I can find his trail
and track him down,

04:03.643 --> 04:06.143
it'll strengthen SD-6.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.682
I got into this
to bring them down.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.849
And now I feel like
I'm on their side.

04:35.141 --> 04:38.201
This is the world of SD-6
when we started, remember?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.781
And here is
what it looks like today.

04:52.025 --> 04:55.791
And this doesn't even take into
account things like Badenweiler

04:55.862 --> 04:58.096
or stealing page 47
from Sloane's vault

04:58.097 --> 05:01.260
or the way you kept Khasinau
from getting that ampule.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.201
Sydney, these are
incredible accomplishments.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.707
Khasinau is out there somewhere.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.712
Yes.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.213
My mom is out there.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.252
We will find them.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.193
I have to go to class.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.432
Wait.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.547
Take care of yourself.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.083
Thanks.

05:56.589 --> 05:57.589
Where was it?

05:57.590 --> 05:59.891
Behind the fridge.

05:59.892 --> 06:00.992
You say you saw it.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.362
No, I didn't see it.
I heard it scratching.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.530
Okay, I'll get some traps.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.833
We need a professional.
We need a hit man.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.168
If there is one,
there are 1,000.

06:10.169 --> 06:10.869
Hello?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.465
You disappoint me, Mr. Tippin.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.742
Ms. Litvack...

06:16.743 --> 06:19.576
You have enough to publish.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.273
You have nothing to fear.

06:22.348 --> 06:23.815
I was kidnapped.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.478
The lives of people
I care about were threatened.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.052
It's a bluff to scare you
off the story.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.622
Well, you know what?
It worked. I'm off it.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.502
Just go away.
Don't call me again.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.603
Mr. Tippin...

06:44.604 --> 06:47.698
Don't call anyone, unless
you want more people to die.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.041
It was Jack Bristow.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.542
What?

06:52.879 --> 06:55.712
What? Wait.
What was Jack Bristow?

06:55.782 --> 06:58.282
Hello?

07:35.688 --> 07:37.422
We have rats.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.490
What?

07:38.491 --> 07:40.959
In all likelihood.
Possibly mice. Hi.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.520
Hi. Mice isn't better
than rats.

07:43.596 --> 07:46.793
There's no way they're mice.
They're rats. They're huge.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.391
The exterminator's coming.
Can you be here?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.802
No, I've got work.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.303
But I have to cater a lunch
for 30.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.208
I don't live here.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.076
- Why are you always here?
- It's not like you pay rent.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.079
What is this? Attack on Will?

08:01.080 --> 08:03.580
Please, just do this for us.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.885
Okay. Fine, I'll do it.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.821
See, the thing about rats is
they're clever.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.356
You have to outthink 'em.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.458
You can't really
just leave out cheese.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.861
You have to leave
the good stuff.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.629
The stuff that they want.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.190
It's the only way
they're gonna come out.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.292
Otherwise,
you're just wasting your time.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.929
I can't believe
I didn't think of this before.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.039
We can make Khasinau come to us.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.808
What are you thinking?

08:29.809 --> 08:32.308
The vial of liquid.
The Rambaldi solution.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.678
The one the CIA now has.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.179
That's why Khasinau had a team
break into SD-6.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.517
He wants that solution.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.885
I'd like to suggest
a course of action.

08:41.953 --> 08:45.151
Quickly.
I've got a meeting with NIC.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.216
Remember the vial
of liquid we got from SD-6

08:48.294 --> 08:51.127
that allowed us to read page 47
of the Rambaldi manuscript?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.464
Uh-huh.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.298
What I'm suggesting
is a black-market sale.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.496
Khasinau still thinks that vial
is in the SD-6 vault.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.439
We say there's another one.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.210
You think we can make Khasinau
believe that?

09:05.211 --> 09:05.810
Yes.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.013
We're gonna have to make it
sound legit.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.282
Last year, Sloane sent
a team of agents

09:10.283 --> 09:12.350
into the Carafu Art Museum
in Algiers,

09:12.351 --> 09:14.686
after an OPEC minister
donated a collection

09:14.687 --> 09:17.952
that Sloane believed might
contain Rambaldi artifacts.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.691
Why don't I know about this?

09:19.692 --> 09:22.490
Because the mission failed.
The agents were caught.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.328
Before they could be questioned,
SD-6 had them killed.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.072
Say there was a break-in
at that museum this week.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.074
It would be widely publicized.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.374
Khasinau would start to hear
rumors of what was taken.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.710
Including rumors
of an existing second ampule.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.717
You're suggesting I approve
the theft of priceless art?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.252
We would be borrowing them.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.721
We'd return everything we steal,

09:49.722 --> 09:52.247
but not until after we've made
contact with Khasinau.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.793
The whole point
is to get noticed.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.695
"We"? You're proposing
to go with her?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.497
I know I'm not a field agent,

09:59.498 --> 10:02.365
but Agent Bristow
will need backup.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.002
She trusts me.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.503
The plan is to go in
as insurance agents

10:06.505 --> 10:08.473
offering
to lower their premiums.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.910
We would have to inspect their
security system thoroughly.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.775
I downloaded the mission specs
from the SD-6 archives.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.514
Alarm types at the museum,

10:16.515 --> 10:19.609
activation points, blueprints.
Everything.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.185
This is our best shot
at Khasinau.

10:23.723 --> 10:24.823
Do it.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.554
- You'll deal with the op tech?
- I'll take care of it.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.428
I have to stop by the hospital.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.597
Emily's not doing well.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.098
Yeah.
She's sick from the chemo.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.698
We heard that from the bug
in Sloane's study.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.405
I'm sorry.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.442
Yeah, thanks.

10:44.443 --> 10:48.038
Can I get the number
for Druzinsky's Pest Control?

10:48.114 --> 10:50.614
Sure, yeah, it's D-R-U...

10:50.650 --> 10:53.744
Yeah, hold on.
Let me just get a pen.

10:56.689 --> 11:00.216
Hold on.
Yeah, hold on just a minute.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.893
Okay, go.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.561
Yeah. 323...

11:04.897 --> 11:08.697
Naturally, the guy
shows up right... Sorry.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.836
- Hi.
- How you doing?

11:11.837 --> 11:12.971
Good, good.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.205
Where's the problem?

11:14.206 --> 11:16.675
Well, we got rats.
Over here.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.643
Behind the refrigerator
right there.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.144
Let me see your rats.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.755
Gnawed wood.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.256
Droppings.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.224
Yeah, these are rat droppings.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.958
Well, kill 'em, please.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.503
You got kids?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.807
No.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.141
Household pets?
Dogs, cats?

11:53.312 --> 11:54.979
Hello?

11:54.980 --> 11:57.642
What?
No, I don't have any pets.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.311
Then I'd skip traps
and go right to baiting.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.589
This will be your only warning.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.128
Oh, my God.

12:15.634 --> 12:18.134
Sydney.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.700
I don't know if you feel well
enough to eat these, but...

12:22.808 --> 12:25.308
Total contraband.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.645
Thank you.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.677
I'm so sorry
you have to go through this.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.688
Oh, Sydney,
tell me something happy.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.089
Happy.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.590
Yeah.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.394
Well, I've got the week off
from work,

12:43.395 --> 12:44.996
which is nothing,

12:44.997 --> 12:47.497
considering your husband
owes me 50 comp days,

12:47.566 --> 12:52.230
but I've been working
really hard lately, so...

12:53.906 --> 12:56.107
Can I give you some advice?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.608
Please.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.413
When you look back...

13:02.414 --> 13:05.975
family, your friends...

13:06.051 --> 13:07.652
that's what matters.

13:07.653 --> 13:11.350
Work, your job...

13:11.423 --> 13:13.923
it won't seem that important.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.828
Even your job.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.531
Even working for SD-6.

13:28.374 --> 13:29.974
I know you can't talk about it,

13:29.975 --> 13:31.776
and I wouldn't have
mentioned it,

13:31.777 --> 13:38.307
except I know how easy it is
to lose perspective on things.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.720
And I don't want to see that
happen to you.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.985
When did Arvin tell you?

13:50.062 --> 13:52.463
He didn't.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.194
Over the years,
I'd overhear things,

13:55.301 --> 13:58.964
find clues that
he never really left

13:59.071 --> 14:01.571
the world of Intelligence.

14:02.842 --> 14:09.179
And I know he keeps me
from the truth to protect me,

14:09.248 --> 14:11.748
to keep me from worrying.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.413
My only regret is
not being able to tell him

14:18.490 --> 14:22.119
how proud I am.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.121
We're good for two minutes.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.622
Dad, it's Emily.
She knows about SD-6.

14:52.658 --> 14:55.158
- I'm worried about her.
- It's too late.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.795
Your conversation was recorded.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.561
- The Alliance knows?
- Yes.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.801
And?

15:03.802 --> 15:07.135
Information about SD-6
must be treated like a virus.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.040
There is only one response.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.975
Containment.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.176
What did you say?

15:12.177 --> 15:14.677
Sloane won't let them
kill Emily.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.180
The decision will not be made
until after Sloane has met

15:17.216 --> 15:19.417
with the head
of Alliance security.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.918
He is the only one
who can save her now.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.177
The time off I asked for
last week.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.754
I'd still like to take it.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.427
Would that be all right?

16:07.866 --> 16:10.835
- Where are you going?
- The desert.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.370
Yeah.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.540
Yes. Of course.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.311
Thank you.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.812
The desert.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.718
Hmm.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.902
To make a risk analysis,

16:44.903 --> 16:47.497
we will need to test
your security system

16:47.606 --> 16:49.674
and see how it operates

16:49.675 --> 16:52.010
during a shutdown
of your primary generator,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.511
heating, electrical,
and ventilation systems.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.715
We'll need to separate.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.378
You'll inspect the alarm grid
in the exhibition.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.387
I'll handle the shutdown
from the control room.

17:02.388 --> 17:06.154
This frequency jammer will keep
the cameras off for 3 minutes.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.693
180 seconds is all you got.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.828
Please
shut down the primary generator.

17:31.817 --> 17:35.014
He says the secondary generator
has always kept

17:35.087 --> 17:37.817
the security monitors
on-line before.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.258
When I close out
the ventilation system...

17:40.259 --> 17:42.360
The turbines will shut down,

17:42.361 --> 17:45.125
allowing me to gain access
to the vault room.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.764
Shut down the ventilation.

17:52.271 --> 17:56.105
<i># Never get out,
it's gonna be a shame #</i>

17:56.175 --> 17:57.708
<i># No doubt about it #</i>

17:57.709 --> 18:02.646
<i># This kind of life
is gonna sedate me #</i>

18:04.049 --> 18:06.050
<i># No doubt about it #</i>

18:06.051 --> 18:11.011
<i># This line of work
is gonna make me crazy #</i>

18:50.562 --> 18:52.964
Now take the heating system
off-line.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.967
The vault room
is located through a shaft

19:04.076 --> 19:07.341
on the east wall,
67 feet below the main level.

19:15.287 --> 19:17.488
According to the documents
you gave me,

19:17.489 --> 19:20.515
the vault is
a third-generation Handvalova.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.959
Careful with that.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.987
It's full of plastic explosives
in case this doesn't work.

19:26.064 --> 19:29.693
Now, in theory, not only
should this crack the safe,

19:29.768 --> 19:31.602
it should short the circuitry
for two minutes,

19:31.603 --> 19:35.039
giving you time to get back
before the alarms go off.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.785
And electrical.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.760
What's going on?

19:55.761 --> 19:57.895
I agreed
to a systems analysis.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.064
Mr. Algazabia
is the museum president.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.632
Not to a shutdown.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.500
We are testing the security.
Everything is okay.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.370
He has ordered
the power restored.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.272
No, wait. My partner and I
flew in from Paris

20:09.341 --> 20:12.401
because we were assured the
possibility to make an offer.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.011
To do that, we must run
a thorough analysis.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.585
When the system is off-line,

20:20.586 --> 20:23.987
essential services go down,
including fire protection.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.556
That is a risk I cannot take.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.094
I will file a formal complaint
with the Legal department.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.533
Take him.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.667
Find his partner.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.168
Show them the way out.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.360
- What's going on?
- We're being kicked out.

21:36.361 --> 21:39.091
I didn't have time to finish
my analysis. Did you?

21:40.532 --> 21:42.233
Barely.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.081
Listen to me.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.883
I really need your help, okay?

21:58.884 --> 22:00.951
You've got to give me
more details.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.153
No, no. No details.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.487
You were kidnapped
by a man who turns out to be

22:05.557 --> 22:06.957
someone you know's father?

22:06.958 --> 22:08.125
- Yes, yes.
- What is this?

22:08.126 --> 22:09.694
This is an article.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.295
Abby, you got to do this for me.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.890
Make sure you keep it sealed,
and don't mention this.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.067
And you got to promise
you're not gonna open it

22:16.068 --> 22:17.368
unless something happens to me.

22:17.369 --> 22:21.100
And if something happens to me,
you got to publish it.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.841
Why would something happen?

22:25.444 --> 22:27.712
Because I'm gonna go see
my kidnapper.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.213
Oh, Will, you've become insane.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.876
I have enough information
that I can write a story,

22:32.951 --> 22:35.319
but I don't have anything
that's gonna put this guy away.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.982
Publish the story now.
That's your insurance policy.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.757
But I'll never get
his cooperation.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.386
There's got to be
some bigger story here.

22:42.461 --> 22:44.961
I want to find out what it is.

22:47.499 --> 22:51.868
Abby, you got to promise me
you're not gonna open it.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.373
Promise me I won't have to.

23:19.798 --> 23:23.097
There are a few things
we need to talk about.

23:23.168 --> 23:26.433
And, quite frankly,
you scare me,

23:26.538 --> 23:28.839
so I'd rather talk about them
in public.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.208
Can I have a beer, please?

23:31.209 --> 23:32.777
You want to talk about what?

23:32.778 --> 23:35.278
Let's start with Sydney.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.914
Does she know?

23:36.915 --> 23:39.016
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:39.017 --> 23:41.517
Does she know
that you kidnapped me?

23:43.288 --> 23:45.950
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.594
Thanks.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.359
No. I don't.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.865
I wrote a story.

23:54.866 --> 23:58.063
No one's seen it yet,
but if I die,

23:58.136 --> 24:00.832
it's gonna get published.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.466
It's a story I don't even
want to work on anymore.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.646
Will, you seem very upset.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.214
Yeah, I am.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.877
'Cause it just won't go away.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.217
This source, who told me
about you, won't let it.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.383
I don't even know
where he lives, where he works.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.292
So you can't beat it
out of me, but he knows.

24:23.361 --> 24:24.962
He knows everything.

24:24.963 --> 24:29.195
He gives me hints and clues,
and he's never wrong.

24:30.936 --> 24:34.599
Now, I don't know
if you work for SD-6

24:34.706 --> 24:37.504
or if you're
responsible for the deaths

24:37.576 --> 24:39.176
of Daniel Hecht
and Eloise Kurtz.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.078
I don't know
if you're protecting Sydney

24:41.079 --> 24:43.414
or if she needs to be
protected from you.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.349
But just tell me
what you know.

24:45.350 --> 24:48.217
Convince me that you put
Sydney's interests first,

24:48.286 --> 24:51.517
that in some sick,
bizarre twist of fate,

24:51.590 --> 24:53.791
you and I are on the same side.

24:53.792 --> 24:57.057
My concern for Sydney
is not yours to judge.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.699
Convince me

25:03.702 --> 25:07.160
by helping me put a stop
to what's going on.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.866
And in return,

25:11.977 --> 25:15.208
I'll help you find out
who my source is,

25:15.280 --> 25:18.113
because I got a feeling

25:18.183 --> 25:20.683
that he's somebody
you'd like to meet.

25:42.607 --> 25:45.107
Thanks, Ethan.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.511
There's been a breach.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.980
Our entire operation could be
compromised.

25:49.981 --> 25:51.081
What's the source?

25:51.082 --> 25:52.883
Best guess.
A whistle-blower.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.513
Well-placed within the agency
with access to Omega 17 files.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.322
He's been talking to a reporter.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.357
You should put
counterintelligence on it.

26:00.358 --> 26:02.793
They should start
with Steven Haladki.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.294
- Haladki?
- He fits the profile.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.931
Agent rising in rank.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.300
Opposed to company policy
regarding SD-6.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.669
Internal efforts
to change policy thwarted.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.704
So he takes it
out of the building.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.439
That's a pretty big charge.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.940
The source is putting
Sydney's life at risk.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.810
Haladki filed a report
on The Prophecy.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.147
He said you threatened him
to get information

26:23.148 --> 26:25.616
on where the Bureau
was holding Sydney.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.451
And then I used that information

26:27.452 --> 26:29.453
to hold other FBI agents
at gunpoint

26:29.454 --> 26:31.922
in order to free my daughter
from a witch-hunt.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.991
You need to get C.I.
On this tonight.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.492
I want you to stop.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.596
I hear your concerns,

26:38.597 --> 26:42.055
and I will choose how
to respond to them myself.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.968
You're a good agent, Jack,

26:43.969 --> 26:47.905
but lately, I find
your methods reprehensible.

26:47.973 --> 26:51.067
If I hear of one more instance
of you acting off book,

26:51.176 --> 26:53.676
you're done.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.945
I'm gonna send flowers to Will

27:05.023 --> 27:07.391
to thank him
for babysitting our rodents.

27:07.392 --> 27:09.952
What do you think
the card should say?

27:10.028 --> 27:11.795
I had sex with someone.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.492
Seriously.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.969
What?

27:20.005 --> 27:22.505
When?

27:22.540 --> 27:25.040
About a week ago.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.311
When were you gonna tell me?

27:27.312 --> 27:29.812
I know. I just...

27:30.649 --> 27:32.883
It was Noah Hicks.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.618
Oh.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.119
I know how you feel about Noah.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.857
Did he just call you up?

27:39.858 --> 27:42.850
No, it was a trip.
It was a business trip.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.620
We just sort of picked up
where we left off.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.699
Well, how is he?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.904
He is...

27:57.742 --> 27:59.910
It didn't end well.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.645
Well, I'm not surprised.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.280
He was never good enough.

28:03.281 --> 28:06.341
Anybody who would just dump you
like that and walk away.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.352
He doesn't deserve
a second chance.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.520
People change.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.021
No. They don't.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.590
What if I started
dating Charlie again?

28:14.659 --> 28:17.159
No, I know.

28:18.496 --> 28:22.091
Hey, you're really down
about this, aren't you?

28:22.167 --> 28:24.667
A little.

28:26.938 --> 28:28.906
There's nothing to be done
about it.

28:28.907 --> 28:32.843
I mean, it's over.

28:34.512 --> 28:37.012
I just wanted to let you know.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.384
Well, maybe you're right.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.843
Maybe I am being
a little too tough on Noah.

28:43.922 --> 28:47.358
Hey, if he calls,
I'll try and be nice, okay?

28:54.365 --> 28:57.801
Marshall, get me the last
bioscan profile on Edward Poole.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.403
Sure. Right away.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.838
That's a pop-up book.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.637
Making them clears my mind.

29:03.708 --> 29:07.644
Feel free to dock me
any amount that you feel is...

29:07.746 --> 29:09.580
Here we go.
This is interesting.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.516
When he came through the room,
he was carrying two phones.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.084
- Can you locate them?
- Yeah.

29:15.653 --> 29:17.254
- There.
- Good.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.556
I have one phone number
on Poole.

29:19.557 --> 29:20.791
I ran a tap on it,

29:20.792 --> 29:26.958
but I couldn't find
any leads on Khasinau.

29:27.031 --> 29:30.023
Well, I can probably
track down the second one.

29:31.202 --> 29:34.035
Just get me
the other number right now.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.479
Let me begin by saying I know
how difficult this is.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.077
My wife is dying.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.555
I understand.

29:51.556 --> 29:53.157
She has lymphoma.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.092
Yes.

29:55.093 --> 29:57.593
We have both video and audio.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.763
This isn't an issue
of confirmation.

29:59.764 --> 30:02.264
No.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.361
No, this is an issue of decency.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.970
The time and date have been set.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.206
She is my wife.

30:17.682 --> 30:21.482
I am not just going to sit back
and allow you to eliminate her.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.957
When I first came
into The Alliance,

30:27.025 --> 30:29.550
my closest friend
was Jean Briault.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.197
He took me into his confidence.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.832
He guided me.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.134
He was my mentor.

30:37.135 --> 30:41.037
But when Briault was murdered
at point-blank range,

30:41.105 --> 30:44.040
I didn't ask any questions.

30:44.108 --> 30:46.975
I didn't talk of decency.

30:52.817 --> 30:55.317
Jean Briault was my friend, too.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.555
His murder was a tragedy.

31:02.427 --> 31:05.419
I'm just trying
to prevent another.

31:06.464 --> 31:09.024
The Alliance knows
you disregarded their policy

31:09.100 --> 31:10.834
and pursued Khasinau.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.970
They're going to want
to see evidence

31:12.971 --> 31:16.099
that your priorities
are in order.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.840
Are you suggesting that
I allow you to kill my wife

31:21.913 --> 31:25.644
to enhance my standing
within The Alliance?

31:35.627 --> 31:38.127
Thanks.

32:02.487 --> 32:05.513
I work in Intelligence.
That is all you need to know.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.925
So Credit Dauphine.
That's a front company?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.793
You and I meet
only when and where I decide.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.524
When you say "Intelligence,"
you mean SD-6, right?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.299
It's some off-the-books...

32:15.300 --> 32:16.934
We go after the source first.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.435
Everything else comes later.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.540
Does Sydney know?

32:25.376 --> 32:28.038
Jack, is your daughter
a part of this?

32:28.112 --> 32:29.947
No, she's not.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.349
- Now, are we clear?
- Yes.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.619
Do you have a way
of contacting your source?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.654
Yeah, I have a transmitter.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.156
It's a pin.

32:39.157 --> 32:42.354
I found it in a box of stuff
belonging to Eloise Kurtz.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.627
What?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.128
I planted that pin
on Eloise Kurtz.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.032
Of course.

32:49.033 --> 32:52.161
Neville said
it was government issue.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.271
So you hired her
to play Kate Jones

32:54.272 --> 32:55.572
so she could lie to me.

32:55.573 --> 32:58.073
When she said too much...

32:59.377 --> 33:01.078
You had her killed.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.212
I did not kill her,

33:02.213 --> 33:05.182
but I bear some responsibility
for her death, as do you.

33:05.249 --> 33:07.451
Focus, Mr. Tippin!

33:07.452 --> 33:11.183
Do as I instruct,
or more people will die.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.392
Okay, why don't I
contact Deep Throat,

33:15.393 --> 33:17.327
and I'll insist upon a meeting.

33:17.328 --> 33:20.297
If you ask for a meeting,
he'll know it's a setup.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.099
You will contact him.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.592
Tell him you know I was the one
who kidnapped you.

33:25.703 --> 33:28.570
Then tell him
you are back on the story.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.139
This meeting never took place.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.827
Edward Poole was a friend.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.963
A visitor to this office.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.626
A former operative with Ml-6.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.329
I was shocked to learn he
has become an ally of Khasinau,

33:59.437 --> 34:02.497
so I asked Marshall to examine
his scanning-room profile

34:02.607 --> 34:04.674
to see if he can come up
with any leads.

34:04.675 --> 34:07.175
Thanks.
Now, this is really good.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.614
I take it you've seen the news?

34:10.614 --> 34:12.149
It's sort of perfect, right?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.382
So far, so good.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.376
- Have you contacted the broker?
- Yeah, I stopped in Lisbon.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.855
I told him I was hired by the
men who pulled off the robbery.

34:18.856 --> 34:19.922
Who?

34:19.924 --> 34:21.824
A splinter group
of the Raslak Jihad.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.827
How much did you say you wanted?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.395
$ 10 million,
and I gave him the sat phone

34:25.396 --> 34:28.126
and said we would only field
offers during that window.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.599
Good.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.069
My father's disabled
the SD-6 satcom intercept,

34:32.070 --> 34:34.902
so there's no way Sloane
can find out.

34:34.972 --> 34:37.040
Okay, based on
R.F. Transmissions,

34:37.041 --> 34:38.909
we were able
to intercept signals

34:38.909 --> 34:41.210
between Poole's cellphone
and the com tower.

34:41.212 --> 34:45.376
From that, we were able to set
up a wiretap on his S.T.U.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.417
Secure Telephone Unit.

34:49.620 --> 34:53.215
Then we were able to get
Khasinau's number

34:53.291 --> 34:54.591
and run a tap on him.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.560
We heard from the broker.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.997
Mr. Khasinau is willing to pay
double our asking price

35:00.064 --> 35:01.064
in diamonds.

35:01.065 --> 35:03.166
Is Khasinau gonna meet us?

35:03.167 --> 35:05.469
No. He's sending Sark.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.462
This is a text of a conversation
this morning

35:08.573 --> 35:10.207
between Khasinau and Mr. Sark.

35:10.208 --> 35:14.372
You will recall the ampule
that McKenas Cole stole from us?

35:14.445 --> 35:17.778
We believed there was only one
ampule in existence.

35:17.849 --> 35:21.910
This conversation indicates
the existence of two.

35:21.986 --> 35:23.520
It says here that Sark

35:23.521 --> 35:25.722
and a splinter group
of the Raslak Jihad

35:25.723 --> 35:29.489
have agreed on the number
of mat√©riel each side can bring.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.894
The deal allows for each side

35:30.895 --> 35:34.092
to have only one principal
and two backups.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.861
If they bring two,
we bring four.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.102
When you and Sark meet,
you will be able

35:39.103 --> 35:40.904
to test each other's
merchandise.

35:40.905 --> 35:44.432
Which is why we need to give him
the real Rambaldi solution.

35:44.542 --> 35:47.042
After he confirms
the liquid is authentic,

35:47.078 --> 35:50.445
you'll switch the vial with an
identical one containing water

35:50.515 --> 35:53.313
and a radioactive isotope
we can track via satellite.

35:53.384 --> 35:57.684
When Sark brings the solution to
Khasinau, he'll be bringing us.

35:57.755 --> 36:00.690
Our pursuit of Rambaldi is
incomplete without that ampule.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.259
So, in order to recover it,

36:02.260 --> 36:04.628
you are authorized to use
all necessary force.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.630
Is that understood?

36:06.631 --> 36:07.831
Yes.

36:07.832 --> 36:08.832
Good.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.167
You leave tonight.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.103
This guy Sark
might have seen you in Moscow.

36:13.204 --> 36:16.173
He didn't.
He won't recognize me this time.

36:16.274 --> 36:19.038
You saw what he did there.
In Hong Kong, too.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.045
If you're suggesting we
bring someone else in, no way.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.280
This is my op.

36:23.281 --> 36:26.045
Okay. We leave
for Denpasar tonight.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.384
Hi.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.587
I don't know
if you can hear me or not,

37:03.588 --> 37:06.088
but I've thought about it.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.791
I'm back on the story.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.512
Hi.

37:38.856 --> 37:41.356
How do you feel?

37:41.926 --> 37:44.793
Better.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.362
Now that you're here.

37:50.334 --> 37:53.235
Dr. Levin stopped by earlier.

37:53.337 --> 37:56.568
He said the biopsy
is scheduled for next week.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.410
Oh, sweetheart.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.505
It's gonna be okay.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.081
We have to believe that.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.785
Yeah.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.690
You are so beautiful.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.693
Oh, I know.
I must look wonderful.

38:23.734 --> 38:26.234
Hold me.

38:38.382 --> 38:42.182
I am so proud of you.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.550
What have you got?

39:13.551 --> 39:15.085
Sark's already in place.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.319
How many men?

39:16.320 --> 39:19.153
One inside and one at the gate
next to one of ours.

39:19.223 --> 39:20.824
He stuck to the plan.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.419
So far. If anything changes,
we're ready.

39:34.572 --> 39:37.439
After you test the merchandise
and make the switch,

39:37.508 --> 39:40.008
you'll go your separate ways.

40:00.297 --> 40:02.165
I thought we had an agreement

40:02.166 --> 40:04.567
that neither side
would have the advantage.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.269
That is the agreement.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.104
Then you have not
lived up to it.

40:08.105 --> 40:11.541
You can see me.
I cannot see you.

40:11.609 --> 40:14.109
You know who I represent.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.945
Well, according to the broker,

40:15.946 --> 40:18.446
you are affiliated
with the Raslak Jihad.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.484
A noble cause, to be sure,

40:21.485 --> 40:23.753
and a group I respect
for its dedication

40:23.754 --> 40:25.889
to the principles
of ancient Kunta.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.415
When I learned of this,

40:28.492 --> 40:30.693
I volunteered
for the assignment.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.862
Because as it turns out,

40:32.863 --> 40:35.991
I'm quite familiar with
the Kunta use of the latajang.

40:38.002 --> 40:40.971
And if you are
who you claim to be...

40:42.072 --> 40:44.666
your skill with a latajang
should be unsurpassed.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.775
Latajang?

40:45.776 --> 40:48.276
Sydney, stick to the plan.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.944
The agreement was clear.
We meet and trade.

40:54.752 --> 40:58.518
And we will,
if you are who you say you are.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.623
Sydney, is he asking you
to fight him?

41:00.624 --> 41:03.422
I've already instructed
my guard to stand down.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.695
If you want the diamonds,
you'll do the same.

41:05.696 --> 41:08.196
Sydney, don't do this.

41:11.101 --> 41:13.601
Sydney.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.042
Sydney.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.580
<i># Stop fooling around #</i>

41:27.718 --> 41:30.218
<i># Stop fooling around #</i>

41:32.022 --> 41:34.522
<i># Stop fooling around #</i>

41:37.428 --> 41:39.928
<i># Stop fooling around #</i>

41:57.081 --> 41:58.248
Excellent.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.082
Let's test the merchandise.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.720
Let's.

42:40.658 --> 42:43.388
Sydney, it's Dixon.
He's here.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.164
Both guards are down.
I repeat, both guards are down!

42:52.236 --> 42:55.831
I am satisfied.
Do we have a deal?

42:57.841 --> 42:59.976
He's at the gate.
Make the switch.

42:59.977 --> 43:02.111
I repeat, make the switch!

43:02.112 --> 43:04.347
Enough. Either we have
a deal, or...

43:04.348 --> 43:06.848
Yes, we have a deal.

43:07.017 --> 43:09.517
Hands in the air!

43:14.959 --> 43:17.459
Where's the vial?

43:22.132 --> 43:25.158
I said, where is it?
