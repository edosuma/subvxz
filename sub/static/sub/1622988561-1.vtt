INTERVIEWER:
Mr. Lansky, why are the
American authorities after you?

01:12.159 --> 01:14.378
Well, apparently some
newspaper man wrote

01:14.422 --> 01:17.120
that I had $300 million.

01:17.164 --> 01:17.947
INTERVIEWER:
Is it true?

01:17.990 --> 01:19.296
[Lansky chuckles]

01:19.340 --> 01:22.430
I wish I had a million dollars.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.606
They accuse me
of making a president.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.651
Now, I don't know Mr. Nixon
any more

01:26.695 --> 01:29.001
than what I've read
in the newspapers.

01:29.045 --> 01:32.396
They claim I have 50%
of Lebanon casinos,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.311
50% of Monte Carlo.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.227
Now how ridiculous
can we really get?

01:37.271 --> 01:38.707
INTERVIEWER:
Mr. Lansky, is there such
a thing

01:38.750 --> 01:40.491
as organized crime?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.933
I have no knowledge
on the subject.

Listen Eva,
I'm in Florida, honey.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.297
Daddy's here for work.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.081
- What do they have here?
- [Chuckles]

02:05.125 --> 02:08.780
They have oranges and gators
and Mickey Mouse.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.826
Next time we can go
and I promise.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.699
Okay Eva,
can you put your momma on?

02:18.268 --> 02:20.314
Christie, Christie,
Christie please?

02:20.357 --> 02:22.751
I know that the check bounced.

02:22.794 --> 02:23.839
Okay, but that's OK.

02:23.882 --> 02:24.970
That's why I'm in Miami.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.147
I'm going to do some book
signings.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.278
Yeah, sure they gotta.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.628
They are putting me
in a fancy hotel,

02:30.672 --> 02:31.803
they gonna give me the--

02:34.502 --> 02:37.505
Christie, I know
my responsibilities, alright?

02:39.246 --> 02:42.379
Look Christie, I'm trying
my best, alright?

02:42.423 --> 02:43.467
Trying my best.

Mr. Lansky, it's a pleasure.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.132
How was your trip?

04:23.175 --> 04:24.960
Fine, thanks, umm.

04:25.003 --> 04:25.961
Hope you don't mind,
I got a coffee.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.789
You mind sitting down there?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.835
Huh, yeah sure.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.141
Thank you.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.582
Hello, Mr. Lansky, how are you?

04:38.626 --> 04:40.715
Fine, Daphne.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.107
How's your mother feel?

04:42.151 --> 04:44.893
Ah, good days and bad, you know.

04:44.936 --> 04:45.763
It is a mission.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.330
Yeah, I know all about that.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.549
What can I get for you, honey?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.812
We'll do a couple of them
sandwiches.

04:50.855 --> 04:54.119
Bills sliced and fatty cut
and an assortment of pickles.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.947
So, the usual.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.340
I'll pick out the best ones.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.428
OK.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.650
I'd like you to remove that.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.436
Ok.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.397
You're from Pittsburgh.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.965
You graduated on scholarship
with honors from Princeton.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.838
You were on the crime beat
at the Fort Wayne News Sentinel

05:16.881 --> 05:18.970
before you started
writing books.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.451
You've got a wife, Christina,
and two young children,

05:21.495 --> 05:23.453
Eva and Jack.

05:23.497 --> 05:27.414
I make it a point of knowing
who I associate myself with.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.982
Mr. Stone,
old business habits never die.

05:33.115 --> 05:36.727
It's a complicated thing,
isn't it, marriage, children.

05:43.430 --> 05:47.390
I've been reading some articles
about you.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.784
Forget all that.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.742
I'm here to tell you
the real story.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.048
[David chuckles]

05:53.091 --> 05:54.789
All right, well, that's great,
cause I'm-

05:54.832 --> 05:56.443
I'm here to write
the real story.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.707
Four packs a day, 60 years.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.623
I finally work up the courage
to quit.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.364
A week later,
I go to see my doctor.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.235
He tells me I'm dying.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.063
[Lansky laughs]

06:08.106 --> 06:10.674
As a writer, I thought you would
appreciate the irony in that.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.807
I do. I'm just I'm very sorry
to hear that.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.766
My circumstances offer me
the privilege

06:15.810 --> 06:18.116
to pick who I want
to tell my story.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.031
Your book on Kennedy paid
you well?

06:20.075 --> 06:21.468
Well, I did OK.

06:21.511 --> 06:25.863
It's been a few years since
lady luck visited you.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.909
Yeah well history doesn't
always repeat itself.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.434
When I was a young boy,

06:31.478 --> 06:34.481
I spent my days
at the public library.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.047
I read everything

06:36.091 --> 06:40.225
and I have a particular interest
in history.

06:40.269 --> 06:44.186
People see the same thing
from different perspectives,

06:44.229 --> 06:46.797
and that fascinates me.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.669
But what do you want from this?

06:48.712 --> 06:52.673
Why does David still want to
write a book about Meyer Lansky?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.370
Oh.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.857
Everything that I've read
in history about you says

07:02.900 --> 07:04.293
you're a complicated man

07:04.336 --> 07:06.948
and maybe I like stories about
complicated people.

07:06.991 --> 07:11.735
And I think that your story,
the real story.

07:11.779 --> 07:12.997
I don't think
he's been told yet,

07:13.041 --> 07:14.521
and I don't think
it's about one man,

07:14.564 --> 07:16.218
I think
it's about the 20th century.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.875
That was quite a speech,

07:20.918 --> 07:22.529
but you didn't answer
the question.

07:24.835 --> 07:25.836
I need the money.

07:25.880 --> 07:30.362
Ah, there it is, the truth.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.930
When I die,
the book is yours to sell.

07:32.974 --> 07:36.194
Until then, you won't show
the manuscript to no one.

07:36.238 --> 07:39.284
Anything I choose to tell you
is off the record

07:39.328 --> 07:42.418
until I give you permission
to put it in the book.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.029
Without my approval, what you
have is a work of fiction.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.379
- I won't incriminate myself.
- OK.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.469
Any conversations
you have about me

07:49.512 --> 07:51.122
outside of our meetings,

07:51.166 --> 07:52.559
- I want to know.
- Sure.

07:52.602 --> 07:57.999
Betray me
and there will be consequences.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.653
Are these terms
are agreeable to you?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.178
Yes sir.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.531
I hope our collaboration
will be a successful one.

No, I'm not.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.486
Jack's got a 103 and he's not
holding his spoon down.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.227
Take him to a doctor.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.925
CHRISTIE: [on phone]
Excuse me?
I took him to the doctor.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.666
Listen, I can't do this, OK?
Not now.

08:56.710 --> 09:00.452
Christie, I gotta chance
to write a new book, alright?

09:00.496 --> 09:01.628
And it could be-

09:01.671 --> 09:02.585
CHRISTIE: [on phone]
Oh, David, no.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.631
Could be something really good.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.589
CHRISTIE: [on phone]
Oh David,
I called your publisher.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.591
They had no idea
you were even in Miami,

09:08.635 --> 09:10.637
which means
you are lying to me.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.073
I can't go through this,
I've got to go.

LANSKY:
You said you read some stories
about me in the papers.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.617
My reputation has a habit
of preceding me.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.272
When they don't know you
they put labels on you,

09:37.315 --> 09:39.840
Master Stock Manipulator.

09:39.883 --> 09:43.887
America's most successful
casino operator in history.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.628
Mob's accountant.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.022
The feds even leaked the story
to the press

09:48.065 --> 09:51.634
about me having
$300 million squirreled away.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.853
[Lansky laughs]

09:52.896 --> 09:54.724
If you find out
who's out there guessing,

09:54.768 --> 09:56.334
please be sure to let me know.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.553
- Yeah.
- You don't get to keep it,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.294
call me
and I'll give you a piece.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.730
- Fair enough.
- [Lansky laughs]

10:00.774 --> 10:02.776
The labels are the accurate?

10:02.819 --> 10:05.387
It's your book.
You decide.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.562
OK, alright.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.650
[Lansky laughs]

10:07.694 --> 10:09.217
Okay.

10:09.260 --> 10:13.003
You strike me as a rather
obsequious guy, David.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.222
[Chuckles]

10:14.265 --> 10:15.745
Quick to please.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.355
Never thought of myself
that way.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.792
- You're seperated.
- Hmm.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.620
What did your wife
think about that?

10:20.663 --> 10:23.492
Did she find you that way?

10:23.535 --> 10:24.885
We're here to talk about you.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.408
We are not here
to talk about me, Mr. Lansky.

10:26.451 --> 10:29.541
No, no, no. We have to talk
about you and me.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.894
- You know, I was married also.
- Yeah?

10:33.937 --> 10:35.460
Yeah, twice.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.334
You know, what they say,

10:39.377 --> 10:40.944
can't live with them,
can't shoot them.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.946
[David chuckles]

10:44.513 --> 10:46.297
So where do we start?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.386
Let's start
when you were a child.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.737
Russia.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.869
The only thing
I remember about Russia,

10:52.913 --> 10:56.046
is one day me and my uncle
crossing a path

10:56.090 --> 10:57.744
and some Cossacks
ordered my uncle

10:57.787 --> 10:59.702
to open his potato sack.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.922
And toss a potato up
in the air.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.010
My Uncle obeyed.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.710
Tossed a potato into the air,

11:07.754 --> 11:11.801
and the Cossack takes out this
fucking sword and swoosh.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.719
He wasn't aiming
for the potatoe.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.679
He was aiming
for my uncle's hands,

11:19.722 --> 11:20.984
Cut it right off.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.116
Tough guys.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.336
But swords,
we didn't have a sword.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.686
That was the difference.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.732
I never forgot that.

11:31.342 --> 11:35.172
I promised myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

11:35.216 --> 11:39.046
The next time I'll be the one
holding the knife.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.309
That's the only thing Russia
ever gave me,

11:41.352 --> 11:42.963
when I swore that day.

11:45.313 --> 11:48.142
Made me stronger,
it sharpened me.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.758
I wish I knew where that
cocksucker was today,

11:55.802 --> 11:58.848
I'll show them
what a tough guy he is.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.503
The real story starts
in America.

12:06.813 --> 12:10.338
LANSKY: [Voice-over]
By the time I was 10,
I was sharp as a shiv.

12:10.381 --> 12:14.690
My mind was my escape
and more than anything, numbers.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.910
Numbers gave my world
some order.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.303
And if a kid with that kind
of interest in numbers,

12:19.347 --> 12:22.742
there was nothing as thrilling
is a dice game.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.308
I would watch them play.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.181
But oh boy, my old man found out
that was how

12:27.224 --> 12:29.313
I was spending my time,

12:29.357 --> 12:30.793
My father?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
Everything he did,
he did for us.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.232
He was an honest man
earning an honest living.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.103
There's nothing wrong with that.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.540
He wasn't living his life.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.411
His life was living him.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.630
I guess that's what we do.

12:41.673 --> 12:45.416
We measure ourselves
against our fathers.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.331
And you?
What was your's like?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.161
My father died when I was young.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.599
That must have been hard.

12:58.429 --> 13:01.824
So being an honest man.
Being an honest father.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.087
Yeah.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.306
Is that beneath you?

13:08.396 --> 13:11.355
What I know is that
life wouldn't wait for me.

13:11.399 --> 13:18.188
[♪♪♪]

13:18.232 --> 13:21.539
LANSKY: [Voice-over]
It all happened so fast,
I put down the nickel

13:21.583 --> 13:23.672
my mother gave me
to pick up some bread.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.852
In a matter of seconds,
my nickel was gone.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.463
Can you imagine having to tell
my mother and father

13:32.507 --> 13:34.074
why we couldn't eat
that night?

13:34.117 --> 13:37.773
He took your money
and you just felt ashamed.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.166
It was rage.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.692
You ever feel that, David?

13:43.735 --> 13:47.827
A rage so strong
it changes the path you're on?

those people in the eye

14:06.454 --> 14:09.674
It did much more than drive me

DAVID:
Why?

42:10.876 --> 42:15.881
To show the world that as long
as my Meyer Lansky was around,

42:18.840 --> 42:21.147
they could never do that to us,
again.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.935
Never.

42:31.331 --> 42:35.901
Rabbi Weiss calls the act
shameful and deplorable.

42:35.944 --> 42:37.598
The rabbi says
there is no difference

42:37.642 --> 42:40.601

they attacked.

I'm Lieutenant Haffenden
of the P3 division

44:07.993 --> 44:10.386
of Naval Intelligence.

44:10.430 --> 44:13.041
As I'm sure you know,
the Germans are sabotaging,

and destroying our ships
all over the North Atlantic.

44:16.218 --> 44:19.308
I've read the papers.
It's terrible.

44:19.352 --> 44:22.224
The enemy is here on our shore.

44:22.268 --> 44:23.312
It's only a matter of time

44:23.356 --> 44:25.271
before there's an attack
on our soil.

44:25.314 --> 44:27.273
We need to ferret out
German spies.

44:27.316 --> 44:30.189
Like you, who's got a problem
with the Sicilians.

44:30.232 --> 44:33.496
Because the Sicilians got
a problem with people like you,

the waterfront.

Are you suggesting that
I'm affiliated with the Mafia?

44:39.198 --> 44:41.983
I'm a businessman, Lieutenant.

44:42.027 --> 44:44.159

Of course.

44:44.203 --> 44:47.032
I'll find your spies,

thing for me.

45:27.812 --> 45:29.465
What can I do to help?

45:31.729 --> 45:34.470
They need you to set up
a meeting with Joe Socks.

your operation.

I was the connection between
the U.S. and the waterfront.

45:50.138 --> 45:52.706
There were German spies working
amongst us.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.274
I extracted whatever
intelligence I could from them

46:52.548 --> 46:55.769
They were planning an enormous
attack on American soil,

46:55.813 --> 46:57.510
but we stopped it.

46:58.772 --> 47:00.295
So, why would you defend
a country

47:00.339 --> 47:02.558
whose government is devoted
to putting you behind bars?

47:02.602 --> 47:05.518
I'm an American and a Jew.

47:05.561 --> 47:08.826
The Germans wanted to destroy
both of those things.

47:08.869 --> 47:11.524
So I wanted to destroy
the Germans.

47:11.567 --> 47:13.308
- And I did.
- OK. But why?

47:13.352 --> 47:15.615
Why was it never
in the in the press?

47:15.658 --> 47:18.574
They could never own up to
the fact that somebody like me

47:18.618 --> 47:21.882
could be capable of doing
any good in this world?

is made of shades of gray.

47:24.972 --> 47:27.148
It's never black or white.

just set the record straight

of your book.

47:34.155 --> 47:36.505

47:36.549 --> 47:38.943
I never felt the need back then.

47:38.986 --> 47:40.466
Why?

47:40.509 --> 47:44.296
It was currency between me
and the United States.

47:44.339 --> 47:46.907
I assume that if I did favors
for the government,

47:46.951 --> 47:48.648
they would always honor
my loyalty.

54:36.838 --> 54:39.058
seen the numbers
we're doing in Saratoga.

54:39.101 --> 54:41.626
No one runs an operation
like I do.

54:41.669 --> 54:46.370
I got the best carpet joints,
Upstate, Jersey, Florida.

54:46.413 --> 54:48.546
No, you don't gotta justify it
to me, Meyer.

54:48.589 --> 54:50.852
Plus, I got the muscle to back
all of 'em.

54:50.896 --> 54:55.204
And the revenue,
the revenue speaks for itself.

54:55.248 --> 55:01.472
I run it like a business
and Ford Motors, Coca-Cola.

55:01.515 --> 55:03.604
You know, like U.S. Steel.

55:07.695 --> 55:11.264
I'll tell you what,

55:11.308 --> 55:13.005
I'll do what I can
to convince the council

55:13.048 --> 55:14.398
that you deserve a spot.

55:14.441 --> 55:15.399
Hmm.

55:17.749 --> 55:18.663
What about Benny?

55:18.706 --> 55:21.013
Benny.

55:21.056 --> 55:23.189
Benny's handling California
for us?

55:30.631 --> 55:32.198
Why are you still awake?

55:32.241 --> 55:34.635
How the hell
am I supposed to sleep?

55:34.679 --> 55:36.158
Do you know what time it is?

55:36.202 --> 55:38.335
Yeah, says the man who comes
and goes at all hours.

55:38.378 --> 55:40.641
Mind your business.

55:40.685 --> 55:41.903
Was out working.

55:41.947 --> 55:43.644
Oh work.

55:43.688 --> 55:45.429
It's always work with you.

55:45.472 --> 55:47.648
Take a look around you.

55:47.692 --> 55:50.216
All this shit.

55:50.259 --> 55:52.827
Where do you think
it comes from, huh?

55:52.871 --> 55:55.743
Maybe try showing
a little gratitude for once.

55:55.787 --> 55:58.267
Gratitude?

55:58.311 --> 56:02.402
The hell with gratitude,
you're a criminal.

56:02.446 --> 56:03.185
Come on.

56:03.229 --> 56:04.622
[Grunting]

56:04.665 --> 56:07.755
[Taking deep breaths]

56:12.456 --> 56:15.110
What happened to you?

56:15.154 --> 56:16.590
You're pathetic.

56:20.464 --> 56:24.424
You think the neighbors
don't talk to you because of me?

56:24.468 --> 56:27.340
I see in your eyes
what you do at night.

56:27.384 --> 56:30.648
Who do you think you are
coming into our home

56:30.691 --> 56:32.780
pretending to be a good man,
huh?

56:32.824 --> 56:34.956
A father?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.524
You think you're helping him?

56:37.568 --> 56:38.395
[Grunts]

56:38.438 --> 56:40.962
Shut your mouth!

56:41.006 --> 56:43.095
It's your fault.

56:43.138 --> 56:45.706
It's your fault he's a cripple.

56:45.750 --> 56:48.013
It's because of you,
it's all because of you!

56:51.103 --> 56:52.583
[Sobs]

56:52.626 --> 56:56.021
It's called "judgement",
it's punishment

56:56.064 --> 56:57.109
for what you've done

56:57.152 --> 56:59.633
and how you live your life,
Meyer.

57:01.853 --> 57:04.769
[Sobs]

57:07.119 --> 57:08.468
God is watching.

57:08.512 --> 57:12.733

he's watching you, I know he is.

57:24.571 --> 57:26.921
DAVID:
You believe that?

57:26.965 --> 57:28.488
Believe what?

57:28.532 --> 57:33.275
We get judged and punished
for the way we live our lives.

57:33.319 --> 57:37.497
The choices we make
that's what defines us.

57:37.541 --> 57:39.847
I don't question the choices
I make.

57:39.891 --> 57:41.283
Never?

57:41.327 --> 57:43.285
I get the feeling sometimes
you don't question

57:43.329 --> 57:45.592
the choices you make either.

57:45.636 --> 57:47.551
Okay, let's talk
about those choices.

57:49.596 --> 57:51.511
Tell me about Murder, Inc.

57:51.555 --> 57:53.774
After Maranzano,

57:53.818 --> 57:57.474
we needed the muscle
to consolidate our power.

57:57.517 --> 57:59.476
I had the right people to do it.

58:01.478 --> 58:02.479
Bingo.

58:04.916 --> 58:07.745
LANSKY: [Voice-over]
A group of nice Jewish
and Italian boys,

58:07.788 --> 58:10.617
you know, the kind a girl wants
to bring home to her mother.

58:10.661 --> 58:12.750
Always willing to lend a hand.

58:12.793 --> 58:15.840
[Grunting & yelling]

58:15.883 --> 58:19.670
DAVID: [Voice-over]
"Murder, Inc.",
that's what they called them.

58:19.713 --> 58:23.543
There was Abe "Kid Twist" Reles,
"Tick-Tock" Tannenbaum,

58:23.587 --> 58:27.504
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter,
an army of enforcers,

58:27.547 --> 58:30.681
hired assassins,
a thousand hits between 'em,

58:30.724 --> 58:33.684
they put contract killers
on payroll.

58:33.727 --> 58:35.555
There were no rules
on how to kill.

58:35.599 --> 58:39.907
As long as you got it done,
you got paid.

58:39.951 --> 58:43.650
Most were shot, stabbed,
strangled, drowned, burned,

58:43.694 --> 58:48.307
buried alive, left to bleed dry,
all of 'em unrepentant,

58:48.350 --> 58:50.744
cold-blooded killers.

58:50.788 --> 58:53.573
And Lansky was their general.

58:53.617 --> 58:56.445
Through sheer determination
and fearlessness,

58:56.489 --> 58:59.013
Lansky finally got
what he wanted,

58:59.057 --> 59:01.625
a seat at the table
sitting right beside guys like

59:01.668 --> 59:06.368
Joe Bonnano, Frank Costello,
Al Capone, Italian--

59:06.412 --> 59:08.414
- Meyer.
- To Meyer.

59:08.457 --> 59:10.590
DAVID: [Voice-over]
Jewish and Irish mob bosses
from across America,

59:10.634 --> 59:12.810
together, they formed
the largest organization

59:12.853 --> 59:15.029
of crime the world
has ever known,

59:15.073 --> 59:16.814
the National Crime Syndicate.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.090
I don't know understand

59:32.133 --> 59:33.308
when they're investigating
Lansky,

59:33.352 --> 59:35.702
no one bothered to look
at the old files.

59:35.746 --> 59:38.705
Hey, we're talking 40 years
of transcripts, depositions,

59:38.749 --> 59:40.707
surveillance reports.

59:40.751 --> 59:42.579
That's a lot of material.

59:42.622 --> 59:45.843
Frank, look at this.

59:45.886 --> 59:47.235
It says he's still alive.

59:50.543 --> 59:54.721
Mr. Sims, I'm Special Agent
Frank Rivers with the FBI.

59:56.941 --> 59:58.682
[Grunts]

59:58.725 --> 1:00:01.075
I'd like to talk to you
about your association

1:00:01.119 --> 1:00:02.381
with Meyer Lansky.

1:00:02.424 --> 1:00:05.036
Never heard of him.

1:00:05.079 --> 1:00:07.647
I can make your life in here
a whole lot easier, you know.

1:00:07.691 --> 1:00:09.736
I'm gonna die in here.

1:00:09.780 --> 1:00:11.520
The hell are you gonna do
for me?

1:00:11.564 --> 1:00:13.087
Get me fresh soup?

1:00:13.131 --> 1:00:16.438
Well, Lansky sent you on a job
and you got caught

1:00:16.482 --> 1:00:19.050
and right now he's uh--

1:00:19.093 --> 1:00:20.965
he's having
a pretty comfortable life,

1:00:21.008 --> 1:00:22.488
and you're stuck in here.

1:00:22.531 --> 1:00:24.403
You gonna pop him for me,
are you?

1:00:24.446 --> 1:00:25.752
I can put him away.

1:00:25.796 --> 1:00:27.580
Make it so his life's
not a whole lot different

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:29.495
from yours.

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:31.802
I'm looking for his money.

1:00:31.845 --> 1:00:34.892
He started stashing it away
back in the Murder, Inc. days.

1:00:34.935 --> 1:00:37.068
So who was keeping the books
back then?

1:00:37.111 --> 1:00:39.244
- No money.
- What do you mean no money?

1:00:39.287 --> 1:00:41.289
There's no money in murder.

1:00:41.333 --> 1:00:47.034
It wasn't a sustainable business
not like a casino.

1:00:47.078 --> 1:00:48.209
There was money.

1:00:48.253 --> 1:00:49.863
Maybe he just didn't tell you
about it,

1:00:49.907 --> 1:00:51.952
he was stuffing the walls
with it.

1:00:51.996 --> 1:00:52.953
[Spits]

1:00:56.174 --> 1:00:58.132

You listen to me,
you piece of shit.

1:01:01.353 --> 1:01:05.183
The only reason you're in here
is because of that asshole.

1:01:05.226 --> 1:01:07.925
Well, now you can suffer
the rest of your time in here

1:01:07.968 --> 1:01:09.535
because of him, too.

1:01:11.102 --> 1:01:13.452
Geneva.

1:01:13.495 --> 1:01:15.715
Geneva?

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:19.153
He had a money manager
in Geneva.

1:01:41.567 --> 1:01:42.829
What are you doing with that?

1:01:47.573 --> 1:01:49.357

1:02:01.456 --> 1:02:03.197
What-- what is it?

1:02:03.241 --> 1:02:05.156
Ray turned state's
evidence,

1:02:05.199 --> 1:02:07.898
he made a deal with the Feds,
they reduced his sentence.

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:09.203
And he named me
as one of his partners

1:02:09.247 --> 1:02:10.509
in his drug operation.

1:02:10.552 --> 1:02:12.337
So the Feds came to me
and they said that

1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:14.382
I would go to prison
if I didn't cooperate.

1:02:14.426 --> 1:02:15.688
Okay.

1:02:18.125 --> 1:02:19.431
So how?

1:02:19.474 --> 1:02:20.562
It's "cooperate"
that's the word that they used?

1:02:20.606 --> 1:02:22.173
Get close to you.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:28.179
Okay, and then?

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:30.747

from your files.

The name of associates
and accomplices.

everything down

1:03:07.522 --> 1:03:09.089
and give it to them
and that's what I did.

1:03:09.133 --> 1:03:11.526
Okay, what else did they want?

1:03:11.570 --> 1:03:13.746
What else they wanted
apart from names?

1:03:13.790 --> 1:03:15.443
They said you might have
information on money

1:03:15.487 --> 1:03:16.923
that Lansky laundered years ago.

Miss Duffy checked out
late last night.

1:06:05.526 --> 1:06:07.789
How did you evade the Feds,

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:09.748
like how did you
and your business associates

1:06:09.791 --> 1:06:12.620
become so successful under
the scrutiny of the government?

1:06:12.664 --> 1:06:15.275

I can hardly hear you.

How did you and your associates
like that were very successful

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.589
under the scrutiny
of the government?

1:06:24.632 --> 1:06:26.025
How did you do that?

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:28.506
The way any legitimate
company does.

1:06:28.549 --> 1:06:32.466
We were making more money
than some Fortune 500 companies.

1:06:32.510 --> 1:06:35.556
We got assets to manage
and we had the best talent

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:36.993

business practices?

1:06:51.616 --> 1:06:53.574
'Cause I think that's what
everyone wants to know.

1:06:53.618 --> 1:06:56.708
I taught my associates that
there are benefits,

cost benefit of keeping a guy
that owes you money alive

1:07:01.321 --> 1:07:05.064
instead of goons, I said,
we ought to send accountants.

Additional sum for
the cash reserve and profit

1:07:09.068 --> 1:07:13.072
should be passed along
to be put in the credit column

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:14.421
of the ledger.

1:07:14.465 --> 1:07:15.944
There's a reason
I dropped out of school

1:07:15.988 --> 1:07:17.598
when I was 12.

1:07:17.642 --> 1:07:18.512
Let him talk.

1:07:18.556 --> 1:07:19.774
That guy made more money

1:07:19.818 --> 1:07:21.341

- Uh.

1:07:22.473 --> 1:07:23.648
Any questions?

1:07:23.691 --> 1:07:26.259
In the early days,
a man owed you money,

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:29.741
you would send goons
to break his body apart,

1:07:29.784 --> 1:07:32.787
and if he couldn't pay,
he'd find an unfortunate end.

1:07:32.831 --> 1:07:35.747
Now, rather than kill the guy,
we ordered him,

1:07:35.790 --> 1:07:37.575

1:07:37.618 --> 1:07:39.881

turns a profit.

"Business that makes nothing
but money is a poor business."

1:08:15.569 --> 1:08:18.311
Gambling and casinos
are to entertainment,

1:08:18.355 --> 1:08:21.749

was to transportation.

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:22.924
For some business,

1:08:22.968 --> 1:08:24.404

Okay, you wake up

1:08:33.326 --> 1:08:36.416
Henry Ford's product
wasn't the car.

1:08:36.460 --> 1:08:39.593
It was the freedom
the car gave to people.

1:08:39.637 --> 1:08:42.030
Freedom is what people wanted.

1:08:42.074 --> 1:08:44.816
Our product wasn't gambling
or the casinos.

1:08:44.859 --> 1:08:47.297
It was the world of excitement

1:08:49.299 --> 1:08:53.172
created thousands of jobs,
supported families.

1:08:53.216 --> 1:08:55.087
It was a product.

it's all legalized now,

has its finger in the pie.

Next time, I hope.

1:20:38.616 --> 1:20:41.184
We're hearing things, Meyer,
about Ben.

1:20:42.925 --> 1:20:45.231
What kind of things?

1:20:45.275 --> 1:20:47.668
That he's out of control,
kicking heads in,

1:20:50.062 --> 1:20:52.630
He's lost his focus, Meyer.

1:20:52.673 --> 1:20:55.154
We gave him California,
we gave him Vegas,

1:20:55.198 --> 1:20:57.940
all's we get in return is grief.

1:20:57.983 --> 1:20:59.898

I never wanted my children

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:53.838
You know, I think about it

1:22:57.929 --> 1:23:01.933
My kids see me as a--
a man who tries his best

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:04.501
or-- or some failure?

1:23:04.544 --> 1:23:07.025
It's complicated.

It's a quarter after 2:00 there.

hop on a flight

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:06.650

1:24:06.693 --> 1:24:09.131
Oh, hey pal, listen,
I'd love to,

1:24:09.174 --> 1:24:10.828
but you know, Ginny's
got friends in town, right?

1:24:10.871 --> 1:24:13.396
So probably not for me.

I'm happy things are good
for you, Ben,

1:24:24.102 --> 1:24:26.322

talk about something

1:24:26.365 --> 1:24:28.106
not so pleasant.

did they tell you that?

YOUNG LANSKY: [On phone]
Can you blame them?

1:24:37.072 --> 1:24:41.424
The materials are overpriced,
the construction is delayed.

YOUNG BEN: [On phone]
Do you know how many people
are undertaking this town?

1:24:43.904 --> 1:24:46.037
I can't screw in a light bulb
without a city official

1:24:46.081 --> 1:24:47.952
and he's goddamn maid
coming for a handout.

1:24:47.995 --> 1:24:50.041
- That's the deal.
- The accounting is sloppy, Ben

1:24:50.085 --> 1:24:51.912
and sloppy accounting
leads to concern.

1:24:51.956 --> 1:24:53.131
Do me a favor.

1:24:53.175 --> 1:24:55.394
Remind them that
we own 66% of this casino,

1:24:55.438 --> 1:24:57.788
which means we get to decide
who gets to be concerned.

1:24:57.831 --> 1:25:00.617
66% of nothing is nothing.

1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:03.620
We have to put money back in
to cover the cash flow problem.

1:25:07.189 --> 1:25:09.582
Were you planning on talking
to me about this?

1:25:09.626 --> 1:25:11.497
Of course.

1:25:11.541 --> 1:25:13.020
Of course, I mean
what'd you think

1:25:13.064 --> 1:25:16.328
I wasn't gonna have that
conversation with you?

1:25:16.372 --> 1:25:19.505
How much are we talking about,
Ben?

1:25:19.549 --> 1:25:20.680
Half a million.

1:25:22.508 --> 1:25:25.076
Maybe another three
just to get us

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:26.425
through a few months.

1:25:30.037 --> 1:25:31.517

I know you will, Ben.

1:25:35.869 --> 1:25:37.697

It's not your concern, Anne.

1:26:05.247 --> 1:26:07.205
He's gonna get you killed.

They'll kill you both.

1:34:25.094 --> 1:34:26.312
Why is that?

1:34:27.836 --> 1:34:31.187
My ex-husband, Meyer,

1:34:31.230 --> 1:34:34.581
he never let a dime
out of his sight.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:36.018
[Chuckles]

1:34:39.238 --> 1:34:43.025
If I were you,
I would look to Cuba.

1:34:43.068 --> 1:34:46.985
That is where Meyer made
his first real money.

1:34:47.029 --> 1:34:49.727
I thought he lost everything
when Castro took over.

1:34:49.771 --> 1:34:52.512
You think he would
give all that money

1:34:52.556 --> 1:34:54.123
to a communist.

1:34:55.559 --> 1:34:59.432
Uh, that Batista,
he trusted no one, only Meyer.

1:35:01.826 --> 1:35:03.915
He gave Meyer
what Meyer wanted.

1:35:05.830 --> 1:35:07.963
FRANK:
And what was that?

1:35:08.006 --> 1:35:11.488
To turn that country
into the Monte Carlo

1:35:11.531 --> 1:35:12.968
of the Caribbean.

1:35:16.711 --> 1:35:20.323
If only it had lasted.

1:35:20.366 --> 1:35:21.846
Pfft.

1:35:21.890 --> 1:35:24.806
[Waves crashing]

1:35:26.938 --> 1:35:29.114
Here's one of his diets.

1:35:29.158 --> 1:35:31.595
Matiz Sardine, Jello,
and Irish stew.

1:35:31.638 --> 1:35:33.553
- Blegh.
- Ugh.

1:35:33.597 --> 1:35:37.557
Hey, there's a Lansky associate
in Geneva.

1:35:37.601 --> 1:35:39.298
GREG:
That might be our guy.

1:35:39.342 --> 1:35:42.040
Let's get Stone to run it
by Lansky.

1:35:42.084 --> 1:35:44.869
I got it, of course.

1:35:44.913 --> 1:35:48.568
Hey David,
I got a message for you.

1:35:48.612 --> 1:35:50.266
From Mr. Lansky.

1:36:11.461 --> 1:36:13.028
What-- what do you want?

1:36:13.071 --> 1:36:15.247
I'm beginning to think
you're not taking me seriously.

1:36:15.291 --> 1:36:16.292
Hey, he's not even here.

1:36:16.335 --> 1:36:17.772
I've got nothing.

1:36:17.815 --> 1:36:18.729
Man, I think we're done.

1:36:18.773 --> 1:36:19.817
I think the book is done.

1:36:19.861 --> 1:36:21.079
- I think--
- Listen to me.

1:36:21.123 --> 1:36:22.602
We're looking for an associate
of Lansky's.

1:36:22.646 --> 1:36:25.257
He goes by the name "Pinkus".

1:36:25.301 --> 1:36:26.824
He's 81, alright?

1:36:26.868 --> 1:36:28.826
He's mind's not that sharp.

1:36:28.870 --> 1:36:30.915
I think that some of the stuff
he's been saying is--

1:36:30.959 --> 1:36:32.308
it's a little incoherent.

1:36:32.351 --> 1:36:34.832
Trust me,
he'll remember this name.

1:36:34.876 --> 1:36:38.140
Find out who he is, okay?

1:36:38.183 --> 1:36:39.619
You've got a pen,
I'll write it down.

1:36:39.663 --> 1:36:42.753
Pink-ass,
that you could remember.

1:36:47.714 --> 1:36:49.499
[Knocking on door]

1:36:51.762 --> 1:36:52.937
LANSKY: [On radio]
Hello, David.

1:36:52.981 --> 1:36:54.547
Come in, come in.

1:36:56.462 --> 1:36:58.856
I didn't feel like
going out today.

1:36:58.900 --> 1:37:00.162
You want coffee?

1:37:00.205 --> 1:37:01.250
DAVID:
No, thanks, I'm fine.

1:37:05.950 --> 1:37:07.386
Is that your father?

1:37:15.394 --> 1:37:17.483
When Israel turned me down,

1:37:17.527 --> 1:37:19.616
all I could think about was
how embarrassed

1:37:19.659 --> 1:37:20.922
he would have been.

1:37:22.924 --> 1:37:25.665
I was always ashamed of him.

1:37:25.709 --> 1:37:28.233
In my mind, he was weak.

1:37:28.277 --> 1:37:30.496
Busting his balls
earning pennies.

1:37:32.107 --> 1:37:35.762
He felt the same about me,
shame

1:37:35.806 --> 1:37:38.113
for having a gangster
for a son.

1:37:44.902 --> 1:37:48.036
I didn't go to his funeral,
my own father.

1:37:50.690 --> 1:37:52.997
I don't have the power
to change my past,

1:37:53.041 --> 1:37:56.131
I do have the power to change
the perception of it.

1:37:57.784 --> 1:38:00.875
Do as I ask
and you will be rewarded.

1:38:03.181 --> 1:38:05.314
You would do what I ask.

1:38:05.357 --> 1:38:06.576
Let's sit on the porch.

1:38:06.619 --> 1:38:07.272
GREG:
Turn it back now.

1:38:07.316 --> 1:38:08.099
Switch over to two.

1:38:14.758 --> 1:38:15.933
What's going on?

1:38:15.977 --> 1:38:18.631
We lost, he knows
we're listening to him.

1:38:18.675 --> 1:38:19.850
Goddammit.

1:38:24.333 --> 1:38:26.596
There's a name that came up
in my research,

1:38:26.639 --> 1:38:27.945
someone named "Pinkus".

1:38:31.906 --> 1:38:33.342
Huh?

1:38:33.385 --> 1:38:35.213
Someone named "Pinkus".

1:38:38.434 --> 1:38:42.655
You mean Sal Rosenstein,
tough son of a bitch,

1:38:42.699 --> 1:38:45.963
his entire family died
at Takhel.

1:38:46.007 --> 1:38:48.574
After the war,
he moved to Switzerland,

1:38:48.618 --> 1:38:51.099
did some banking for me.

1:38:51.142 --> 1:38:53.536
Pinkus was my nickname for him.

1:38:58.628 --> 1:39:02.762
Wanted Pinkus' identity,
get a pen.

1:39:02.806 --> 1:39:04.939
Saul Rosenstein.

1:39:06.766 --> 1:39:08.203
Yeah, yeah.

1:39:08.246 --> 1:39:09.465
Put the money
in my wife's account

1:39:09.508 --> 1:39:10.901
and make sure they're safe.

1:39:10.945 --> 1:39:12.511
And let my family alone.

1:39:18.778 --> 1:39:20.389
[Sighs]

1:39:23.958 --> 1:39:25.960
We found him.

1:39:26.003 --> 1:39:27.831
Who, Rosenstein?

1:39:27.874 --> 1:39:29.876
Yeah, he was in Geneva.

1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:30.790
Where is he now?

1:39:30.834 --> 1:39:32.227
He died 48 hours ago.

1:39:32.270 --> 1:39:35.143

It's Rivers, Saul Rosenstein
was killed in a car accident

1:39:54.292 --> 1:39:56.860
- 48 hours ago.
-Say again.

1:39:56.903 --> 1:39:58.557
FRANK: [On phone]
I'm saying that Lansky
had him killed.

1:39:58.601 --> 1:40:00.211
This is not a coincidence.

1:40:00.255 --> 1:40:02.300
I would advise you
to stop talking to Lansky.

1:40:02.344 --> 1:40:12.267
[♪♪♪]

1:40:15.835 --> 1:40:17.576
Mr. Rivers,
as soon as you called,

1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:20.101
we started running a query
into our database.

1:40:20.144 --> 1:40:22.233
It appears Mr. Rosenstein
moved his money

1:40:22.277 --> 1:40:24.801
primarily to one place, Israel.

1:40:24.844 --> 1:40:27.064
Rosenstein was Mossad.

1:40:27.108 --> 1:40:29.153
We've got a paper trail
of laundered money

1:40:29.197 --> 1:40:32.678
going in and out of Geneva
into Israel to a bank

1:40:32.722 --> 1:40:34.202
called "Mekif".

1:40:34.245 --> 1:40:36.030
And you think that money
was Lansky's?

1:40:36.073 --> 1:40:38.075
I think it's why Lansky wanted
to get into Israel.

1:40:38.119 --> 1:40:39.337
His money's there.

1:40:45.213 --> 1:40:48.172
MEKIF EMPLOYEE:
Mr. Rivers,
welcome to Israel.

1:40:48.216 --> 1:40:50.087
We've been expecting you.

1:40:50.131 --> 1:40:52.176
I will be taking you down
to the vault.

1:40:57.051 --> 1:40:59.183
Here it is.

1:40:59.227 --> 1:41:00.706
Thank you.

1:41:18.202 --> 1:41:19.551
Son of a bitch.

1:41:19.595 --> 1:41:21.162
And God said to Abraham,

1:41:21.205 --> 1:41:26.123
"Abraham, take your son,
your only son whom you love,

1:41:26.167 --> 1:41:29.735
Isaac, and sacrifice him
upon one of the mountains

1:41:29.779 --> 1:41:31.520
that I will tell you."

1:41:31.563 --> 1:41:36.002
And Abraham went forth
with Isaac to do just that.

1:41:36.046 --> 1:41:39.223
But perhaps what God
really wanted was for Abraham

1:41:39.267 --> 1:41:42.357
to say, no.

1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:46.143
We praise God now for those
who have departed this world

1:41:46.187 --> 1:41:49.842
as we stand for the Kaddish,
let us all stand.

1:42:13.083 --> 1:42:14.258
Prayer for the dead, right?

1:42:14.302 --> 1:42:15.172
Kaddish.

1:42:15.216 --> 1:42:16.521
Is that for your father?

1:42:16.565 --> 1:42:18.871
Or was it for Saul Rosenstein?

1:42:18.915 --> 1:42:23.789
Remember Saul Rosenstein,
your friend Pinkus is dead

1:42:23.833 --> 1:42:25.051
and he died in a car accident.

1:42:26.357 --> 1:42:27.750
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:42:27.793 --> 1:42:29.012
Three days ago.

1:42:32.450 --> 1:42:34.757
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:36.280
I just think
it's a bit coincidental,

1:42:36.324 --> 1:42:37.586
we were just talking about him

1:42:37.629 --> 1:42:41.242
and then something terrible
happens to him.

1:42:41.285 --> 1:42:43.026
[Laughs]

1:42:43.069 --> 1:42:45.071
Maybe he's dead

1:42:45.115 --> 1:42:47.683
or maybe they just think
he's dead.

1:42:47.726 --> 1:42:49.250
Just tell me the truth.

1:42:49.293 --> 1:42:51.687
You mean like the truth that
you're speaking to the Feds?

1:42:54.777 --> 1:42:57.214
You betrayed me, David,
you broke my heart,

1:42:57.258 --> 1:42:59.651
you made a deal with me
and you broke your word.

1:42:59.695 --> 1:43:01.131
Yeah, I did talk to them.

1:43:01.175 --> 1:43:03.481
I did, yeah.

1:43:03.525 --> 1:43:06.267
You know why I did it?

I think.

what I had to do for my family.

the rest of the story...

INTERVIEWER:
Mr. Lansky, is there such
a thing as organized crime?

1:44:10.331 --> 1:44:12.985
I have no knowledge
on the subject

1:44:13.029 --> 1:44:15.553
and I'd like to live
the remainder of my days

1:44:15.597 --> 1:44:16.989
in Israel.

1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:29.872
I got a tip from a friend,
Golda Meir's lobbying Nixon

1:44:29.915 --> 1:44:32.918
to supply Israel
with F-4 fighter bombers.

1:44:32.962 --> 1:44:34.485
What's that got to do with me?

1:44:34.529 --> 1:44:37.096
The prime minister was told that
in order for that deal

1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.315
to go through,

1:44:38.359 --> 1:44:40.578
she'd have to see to that
you leave Israel

1:44:40.622 --> 1:44:42.363
and return to the U.S.

1:44:42.406 --> 1:44:45.670
State Department
is revoking your passport.

1:44:45.714 --> 1:44:47.890
You need to surrender
at the embassy.

1:44:47.933 --> 1:44:52.286
The Law of Return says
every Jew has the right

1:44:52.329 --> 1:44:56.159
to citizenship in Israel.

1:44:56.202 --> 1:44:58.335
There's nothing I can do.

1:44:58.379 --> 1:44:59.554
I'm sorry.

1:44:59.597 --> 1:45:02.513
After everything I did
for this country,

1:45:02.557 --> 1:45:06.212
after all I gave them
when they begged me for money,

1:45:06.256 --> 1:45:07.301
for weapons.

1:45:07.344 --> 1:45:08.693
Doesn't she remember?

1:45:08.737 --> 1:45:12.088
This is how they repay me,
making me the only Jew

1:45:12.131 --> 1:45:15.221
in history to be banned
from his country.

1:45:15.265 --> 1:45:16.440
How dare she?

1:45:16.484 --> 1:45:18.224
How dare she?

1:45:19.965 --> 1:45:22.707
They've already arranged
for your return to the U.S.

1:45:22.751 --> 1:45:24.230
They're charging you
with contempt of court--

1:45:24.274 --> 1:45:25.362
Oh my God.

I won't go back there.

1:45:30.411 --> 1:45:33.152
I want you to help me
find a place,

a country that will take me.

1:45:35.329 --> 1:45:36.242
I have money.

1:45:36.286 --> 1:45:38.157
Name the price.

I don't want your money, Meyer.

1:45:40.159 --> 1:45:42.118
I believe your people
have betrayed you.

1:45:45.121 --> 1:45:46.514
I'll say.

1:45:52.694 --> 1:45:54.304
[Sighing]

1:45:54.348 --> 1:45:57.046
And after all that, they were
never able to indict you.

1:45:57.089 --> 1:45:58.308
[Sighs]

1:45:58.352 --> 1:46:01.572
The charges against me,
contempt of court,

1:46:01.616 --> 1:46:04.619
conspiracy, they were dropped.

1:46:08.013 --> 1:46:11.060
You can go back to Israel.

1:46:11.103 --> 1:46:13.323
[Laughs]

1:46:13.367 --> 1:46:17.240
The wandering Jew,
just like Lucky said.

1:46:21.679 --> 1:46:24.465
[Sighs]

1:46:24.508 --> 1:46:27.206
Have we arrived at the end
of my story?

1:46:33.212 --> 1:46:34.779
[Sighs]

1:46:39.088 --> 1:46:40.655
What about the money?

1:46:49.359 --> 1:46:50.447
Hmm.

1:46:52.014 --> 1:46:54.451
Come for a ride.

1:47:36.101 --> 1:47:37.886
Buddy.

1:47:37.929 --> 1:47:47.809
[♪♪♪]

1:48:29.024 --> 1:48:30.678
Gangster?

1:48:34.682 --> 1:48:39.817
I'm an angel
with a dirty face.

1:48:49.610 --> 1:48:53.004
I think we're finished, David.

1:48:53.048 --> 1:48:54.571
Go home.

1:48:57.618 --> 1:48:59.445
To your family.

1:49:01.404 --> 1:49:03.537
Remember me.

1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:13.459
[♪♪♪]

1:49:22.077 --> 1:49:25.036
[Sobbing]

1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:35.003
[♪♪♪]

1:49:51.019 --> 1:49:56.285
DAVID: [Voice-over]
When all is said and done,
how do we measure ourselves?

1:49:58.679 --> 1:50:00.985
If Lansky taught me anything,
it's that

1:50:01.029 --> 1:50:02.552
there's only one measure
in this world

1:50:02.596 --> 1:50:04.032
that truly matters.

1:50:06.295 --> 1:50:07.688
We measure ourselves
through the eyes

1:50:07.731 --> 1:50:09.733
of the ones we love.

1:50:13.911 --> 1:50:15.739
[Taking deep breaths]

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:22.659
DAVID: [Voice-over]
Somewhere on the stretch
of highway

1:50:22.703 --> 1:50:25.444
between Miami and home,
it all made sense.

1:50:25.488 --> 1:50:28.578
Lansky spent his life
trying to control the game,

1:50:28.622 --> 1:50:31.189
but in the end,
he knew there was one game

1:50:31.233 --> 1:50:35.063
that no one gets to control,
life itself.

1:50:35.106 --> 1:50:37.456
And you can try
to beat the odds.

1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:40.416
But the house always wins.

1:50:40.459 --> 1:50:41.765
Maybe all you need
every now and then

1:50:41.809 --> 1:50:43.593
is a winning streak.

1:50:50.556 --> 1:50:52.080
You wanted to see me?

1:50:52.123 --> 1:50:53.559
Yeah, come on in, Frank.

1:51:00.044 --> 1:51:02.264
We're shutting
the investigation down.

1:51:02.307 --> 1:51:04.092
Wait, what?

1:51:04.135 --> 1:51:05.093
Why?

1:51:05.136 --> 1:51:06.572
It's over, Frank.

1:51:10.489 --> 1:51:11.534
Who's killing it?

1:51:11.577 --> 1:51:13.318
The CIA?

1:51:21.022 --> 1:51:23.894
Before your time, sonny boy.

1:51:23.938 --> 1:51:33.817
