00:33.382 --> 00:34.348
Children, you're in for a treat.

00:34.383 --> 00:35.649
Today's assembly is devoted

00:35.684 --> 00:37.651
to a special kind of history.

00:37.686 --> 00:39.453
(kids booing)

00:39.488 --> 00:40.654
Living history.

00:40.689 --> 00:42.857
(kids booing louder)

00:42.891 --> 00:44.458
End this madness!

00:44.493 --> 00:47.261
We have two guests who have come
from Springfield!

00:47.295 --> 00:49.430
<i>We</i> come from Springfield!

00:49.464 --> 00:51.899
Illinois! 1858.

00:51.933 --> 00:55.202
Please welcome, here to debate
the important issues of the day,

00:55.237 --> 00:58.339
Stephen Douglas
and Abraham Lincoln!

00:58.373 --> 01:01.475
I appear before you
today for the purpose

01:01.510 --> 01:03.577
of discussing the leading
political topics

01:03.612 --> 01:05.513
which now agitate
the public mind.

01:05.547 --> 01:07.148
(kids booing)

01:07.182 --> 01:09.483
Hit the dirt, squirt!

01:09.518 --> 01:12.019
Well, it seems the, uh...
the good landowners

01:12.054 --> 01:15.056
of Springfield Elementary
are rejecting

01:15.090 --> 01:17.892
Mr. Douglas's position
on tariffs.

01:17.926 --> 01:19.260
Get a room!

01:19.294 --> 01:21.662
I shared beds with men
all the time.

01:21.696 --> 01:23.631
(chuckles):
It was a common practice.

01:23.665 --> 01:26.367
Ooh, common practice.

01:26.401 --> 01:28.002
(kids laugh, Milhouse gasps)

01:28.036 --> 01:29.437
Please, good people!

01:29.471 --> 01:31.238
These are times
of powerful passion.

01:31.273 --> 01:33.741
(grunting)

01:33.775 --> 01:35.776
Why are you
concussing yourself?

01:35.811 --> 01:37.578
Why are you concussing
yourself?

01:37.612 --> 01:39.013
Now, fellow countrymen,

01:39.047 --> 01:41.849
a house divided
against itself...

01:41.883 --> 01:42.983
Ow!

01:43.018 --> 01:45.686
Guess what,
I also play Frankenstein!

01:45.720 --> 01:46.687
(growls)

01:46.721 --> 01:49.056
(kids screaming)

01:49.091 --> 01:51.392
Douglas is getting away!

02:04.306 --> 02:05.673
Skinner!

02:05.707 --> 02:07.708
I have seven
other principals,

02:07.742 --> 02:10.311
and I've never yelled their
names, not even once.

02:10.345 --> 02:11.846
You know what these kids lack?

02:11.880 --> 02:14.448
Well, certainly not
a caring superintendent.

02:14.483 --> 02:15.950
(chuckles):
Well, I, uh...

02:15.984 --> 02:17.051
(clears throat)

02:17.085 --> 02:18.953
Respect.
That's what these kids lack.

02:18.987 --> 02:20.454
So we will hold a contest

02:20.489 --> 02:22.456
to make them tell us
who they respect--

02:22.491 --> 02:24.258
who their heroes are.

02:24.292 --> 02:26.060
A contest?
But, sir, we don't have

02:26.094 --> 02:27.394
any money to pay
for prizes.

02:27.429 --> 02:29.230
We had to rent out
our multipurpose room

02:29.264 --> 02:30.865
to a Japanese-American
social club.

02:30.899 --> 02:31.932
(pachinko machines ringing)

02:31.967 --> 02:33.267
<i>Tanpatsu!</i>

02:33.301 --> 02:36.137
The answer is simple, Seymour:
get a corporate sponsor.

02:36.171 --> 02:38.606
But don't worry, you won't
have to compromise yourself.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.342
So, from now on,
our cafeteria will only serve

02:41.376 --> 02:45.212
delicious Stuffwich's heroes,
hoagies and torpedoes.

02:45.247 --> 02:47.081
What about po' boys?

02:47.115 --> 02:50.050
Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such
as yourself will go hungry.

02:50.085 --> 02:52.586
Now please welcome the star
of Stuffwich's ads--

02:52.621 --> 02:55.489
who lost 400 pounds
eating only Stuffwich subs--

02:55.524 --> 02:56.790
Ezra!

02:56.825 --> 02:58.325
Tell us your hero,

02:58.360 --> 03:00.895
and you could win a Stuffwich
college scholarship.

03:00.929 --> 03:01.929
(kids exclaim)

03:01.963 --> 03:03.831
Then you can be
a hero like me.

03:03.865 --> 03:05.299
What makes you a hero?

03:05.333 --> 03:07.234
I don't eat as
much as I did!

03:09.671 --> 03:11.105
NELSON:
So the chained-up dude

03:11.139 --> 03:13.674
cuts off his own foot
to save his family from Jigsaw!

03:13.708 --> 03:16.677
(voice breaking):
My hero is my mom's boyfriend

03:16.711 --> 03:19.914
who took me to that movie
when I was three.

03:19.948 --> 03:22.650
I call him Uncle Rob because...

03:22.684 --> 03:24.251
he robbed us!

03:24.286 --> 03:25.186
(sobbing)

03:25.220 --> 03:27.021
(giggles)

03:27.055 --> 03:30.758
Madame Curie, we just might have
this one in the bag.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.294
(Ralph giggles)

03:33.328 --> 03:34.862
(laughs)

03:35.697 --> 03:36.864
My hero--

03:36.898 --> 03:39.300
or should I say heroine--

03:39.334 --> 03:41.335
dazzled the early 20th century

03:41.369 --> 03:44.271
with her scientific
discoveries...

03:44.306 --> 03:45.873
(gasps)
Okay, calm down.

03:45.907 --> 03:48.676
Maybe he's talking about
Margaret Mead.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.178
...in the field
of radioactivity!

03:51.213 --> 03:51.812
(gasps)

03:51.846 --> 03:53.013
I give you

03:53.048 --> 03:57.418
Madame Marie Sklodowska-Curie!

03:57.452 --> 03:59.453
("La Marseillaise" playing)

03:59.487 --> 04:00.454
(gasps)
No!

04:00.488 --> 04:03.023
No, no, no, no!

04:03.058 --> 04:04.792
(sobbing)

04:09.931 --> 04:12.600
Martin took my topic.

04:12.634 --> 04:14.034
What do I do?

04:18.673 --> 04:20.841
Oh, just make a
speech about Dad.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.176
Everyone does that.

04:22.210 --> 04:24.245
Everyone does that
with <i>good</i> dads.

04:24.279 --> 04:26.747
But with our Dad, it's like
climbing Mount Everest.

04:26.781 --> 04:29.350
You either plant your flag
at the top of the world

04:29.384 --> 04:31.252
or get frozen
in agony forever.

04:31.286 --> 04:33.354
Either way,
hell of a show.

04:33.388 --> 04:34.922
(music plays, kids cheering)

04:36.424 --> 04:39.226
People, please!
Martin has left the building.

04:39.261 --> 04:40.995
He had an orthodontist
appointment.

04:41.029 --> 04:42.496
(groans)

04:42.530 --> 04:44.231
Okay, Dad's my hero.

04:44.266 --> 04:46.233
<i>Why</i> is he my hero?

04:46.268 --> 04:50.170

04:50.205 --> 04:52.206

05:00.782 --> 05:02.750
SKINNER (over P.A.):
Lisa? Lisa Simpson?

05:02.784 --> 05:06.353
You have ten seconds
to get to the podium.

05:06.388 --> 05:08.922
I'm allowed to eat these!

05:08.957 --> 05:11.258
Our final contestant
is Lisa Simpson,

05:11.293 --> 05:13.360
who was last seen
leaving in tears.

05:13.395 --> 05:14.561
Near tears.

05:14.596 --> 05:15.629
But not in them?

05:15.664 --> 05:16.697
No.

05:16.731 --> 05:18.599
My hero isn't famous...

05:18.633 --> 05:19.700
(scoffs)
Loser.

05:19.734 --> 05:20.634
...isn't rich...

05:20.669 --> 05:21.669
Pathetic.

05:21.703 --> 05:23.604
...and isn't in
any history books.

05:23.638 --> 05:25.105
He makes me sick.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.440
He's my dad.

05:26.474 --> 05:27.408
What?!

05:27.442 --> 05:28.642
He worked two jobs

05:28.677 --> 05:30.010
to get me a pony,

05:30.045 --> 05:32.746
he started me playing
the saxophone you all love...

05:32.781 --> 05:35.015
(murmuring dubiously)

05:35.050 --> 05:37.318
...and anyone can put
a Band-Aid on,

05:37.352 --> 05:40.954
but my Dad knows how to
take it off so it doesn't hurt.

05:40.989 --> 05:42.523
Well, ah.
Oh.

05:42.557 --> 05:45.459
The trick is:
wait several weeks.

05:45.493 --> 05:47.695
And when my Dad
was a soccer referee,

05:47.729 --> 05:49.863
he had the guts to red card me,

05:49.898 --> 05:53.767
his only talking daughter,
because he knew I was diving.

05:53.802 --> 05:55.502
In the history of soccer,

05:55.537 --> 05:59.473
he is the only parent to ever
take sides against his own kid,

05:59.507 --> 06:01.008
and he was right.

06:01.042 --> 06:04.078
He made me a better person,
because that's what heroes do.

06:04.112 --> 06:07.114
<i>That's</i> what heroes do.

06:07.148 --> 06:08.382
(microphone feedback squeals)

06:08.416 --> 06:09.883
(crowd cheering)

06:09.918 --> 06:12.820
I'm so glad
I was forced to come.

06:12.854 --> 06:16.290
People, people... we have a tie!

06:16.324 --> 06:18.125
(clamoring)

06:18.159 --> 06:20.160
Yes, which means
that nobody wins.

06:20.195 --> 06:23.330
The money goes back
in the school general fund.

06:23.365 --> 06:26.433
But we will put
both speeches online.

06:26.468 --> 06:27.935
Behind a paywall.

06:27.969 --> 06:31.105
Now, please fold up your chairs
and stack them.

06:31.139 --> 06:34.708
♪ Cause I'm
a grade school hero ♪

06:34.743 --> 06:36.343

06:54.362 --> 06:55.896
Hmm.
Hey, Dad.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.766
Lisa, your speech was
one of the nicest things

06:58.800 --> 07:00.567
anyone's ever done for me.

07:00.602 --> 07:02.703
When did you come up
with the idea?

07:02.737 --> 07:05.339
You must've worked
on it for days.

07:05.373 --> 07:07.474
Oh, Dad, you don't want
the details.

07:07.509 --> 07:09.743
No one wants to see
the sausage being made.

07:09.778 --> 07:11.378
There's sausage being made?!
Where?!

07:11.413 --> 07:13.447
Homie, there's someone
here to see you.

07:13.481 --> 07:15.048
Coming!

07:15.083 --> 07:17.050
I haven't forgotten
about the sausage.

07:17.085 --> 07:20.053
Mr. Simpson, I am
the executive vice president

07:20.088 --> 07:22.022
of the World Football
Federation.

07:22.056 --> 07:23.023
Ooh!

07:23.057 --> 07:24.158
What you Americans call
"soccer."

07:24.192 --> 07:25.325
D'oh!

07:25.360 --> 07:27.795
I'm sure you are familiar
with the World Cup,

07:27.829 --> 07:30.497
the quadrennial drama
unmatched on the planet!

07:30.532 --> 07:33.567
Oh, yeah. That's the thing
the guys at the dry cleaners

07:33.601 --> 07:35.569
get so excited about
every four years.

07:35.603 --> 07:38.272
I'm afraid there has been
an epidemic of referees

07:38.306 --> 07:40.240
being bribed to throw games.

07:40.275 --> 07:42.609
From the premier leagues
to the playgrounds,

07:42.644 --> 07:44.144
all has been tainted.

07:44.179 --> 07:46.814
We need a symbol
of integrity like yourself.

07:46.848 --> 07:49.383
Of course I am,
but how do you know?

07:49.417 --> 07:51.118
Oh, your daughter's speech
went viral.

07:51.152 --> 07:52.119
(shrieks)

07:52.153 --> 07:54.521
No, no, I mean
it spread like wildfire.

07:54.556 --> 07:55.556
Much better.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.124
Mr. Simpson,
please help us.

07:57.158 --> 07:58.859
The rot is everywhere.

07:58.893 --> 08:01.562
In fact, I see that I myself

08:01.596 --> 08:04.064
am about to be arrested
for corruption.

08:04.098 --> 08:06.233
You will have to take
it from here, Peter.

08:06.267 --> 08:09.136
Yes, I will take good care
of your wife.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.771
Wait, what-what does that mean?

08:10.805 --> 08:13.273
Mr. Simpson,
I am the new executive

08:13.308 --> 08:15.843
vice president of the WFF.

08:15.877 --> 08:19.746
We need outsiders like you
to come to the World Cup,

08:19.781 --> 08:22.850
as our guest,
and ref our games properly.

08:22.884 --> 08:26.053
Well, no one has ever
questioned my professionalism.

08:26.087 --> 08:27.955
Except at my
profession.

08:27.989 --> 08:29.323
(groans)

08:29.357 --> 08:30.624
What do you think,
sweetie?

08:30.658 --> 08:33.659
Dad, they're offering us
an all-expenses-paid trip

08:33.695 --> 08:35.996
to the greatest sporting
event on Earth!

08:36.030 --> 08:38.698
The 2008 Super Bowl?

08:38.732 --> 08:40.100
Oh, I wish.

08:40.134 --> 08:43.636
Eli Manning's pass
to David Tyree.

08:43.671 --> 08:47.007
But about the World Cup,
I need your answer now.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.275
Oh, sure, why not?

08:54.258 --> 08:56.492
"Congratulations
on your purchase

08:56.526 --> 08:58.427
of a FootMaster-brand
soccer ball."

08:58.462 --> 08:59.462
Thanks, book!

08:59.496 --> 09:01.163
Look, you got us
a free trip.

09:01.198 --> 09:03.566
Just slack off and cash your
check like you always do.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.569
I believe the sweet
little girl in 21-D

09:06.603 --> 09:08.704
would disagree with you.

09:08.739 --> 09:09.405
What the...?!

09:09.439 --> 09:10.940
I switched with her, Dad.

09:10.974 --> 09:13.309
My TV didn't work!

09:13.343 --> 09:16.178
Now I can watch
my premium HBO!

09:16.213 --> 09:17.513
(groans)

09:17.547 --> 09:20.216

09:20.250 --> 09:24.086
Well, look at you, using
approved electronic devices.

09:24.121 --> 09:26.422
To try to avoid
any misunderstandings in Brazil

09:26.456 --> 09:30.192
like we had the last time,
I'm learning the language.

09:30.961 --> 09:31.927
COMPUTER:
<i>Olá.</i>

09:31.962 --> 09:33.029
Olá!

09:33.063 --> 09:35.264
<i>Eu amo o</i> Brasil.

<i>Eu amo o</i> Brasil!

<i>O que é um país encantador.</i>

09:40.237 --> 09:41.937
PILOT:
Will you please turn that off?

09:41.972 --> 09:43.806
It's annoying the hell
out of the flight crew.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.775
I was just trying
to learn the...

09:45.809 --> 09:47.843
Everyone thinks they can learn
our language on the plane.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.312
Do you know
how disrespectful that is?

09:49.346 --> 09:50.980
(groans)

09:51.014 --> 09:53.082
All right, just for
that attitude, turbulence.

you the World Cup Round Robin

10:04.494 --> 10:06.128
Group F Opening-Round Match!

10:06.163 --> 10:08.130
Today's game is between
our host country,

10:08.165 --> 10:09.632
football powerhouse Brazil...

10:09.666 --> 10:13.469
CROWD:

ANNOUNCER 2: And with Brazil maintaining
an insurmountable one-goal lead,

10:47.738 --> 10:50.873
with 28 minutes to play,
let's take a look at the refs.

10:50.907 --> 10:53.776
It says here, "Homer Simpson
was recruited for his honesty

10:53.810 --> 10:55.177
and utter disinterest."

10:55.212 --> 10:57.646
ANNOUNCER 2: How did he get
those shorts on over that arse?

10:57.681 --> 10:59.915
ANNOUNCER 1: Rumor has it,
they employed a team of pullers.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.851
(whistle blows, crowd cheers)

11:01.885 --> 11:03.152
Brazil wins it!

11:03.186 --> 11:05.688
And a fairly-called
match it was.

11:05.722 --> 11:07.223
In choosing
Homer Simpson,

11:07.257 --> 11:12.261
the World Cup
has met its goal...!

11:14.798 --> 11:16.432
Andres Cantor,

11:16.466 --> 11:18.601

incorrect usage.

11:18.635 --> 11:22.671

11:22.706 --> 11:27.476

taken its toll...!

Hang on, hang on.

11:44.795 --> 11:46.095
Here you go, honey.

11:46.129 --> 11:48.397
How'd you eat the meat
without the vegetables?

11:48.432 --> 11:50.399
Well, the stomach
wants what it wants.

11:50.434 --> 11:51.400
(burps)

11:51.435 --> 11:52.968
Oh, I need some air.

11:53.937 --> 11:56.105
Ah, Brazil.

11:56.139 --> 11:58.107
I couldn't stay
afraid of you forever.

11:58.141 --> 12:00.309
The only thing that keeps me
from living here

12:00.343 --> 12:02.745
is that fish
that swims up your pee stream.

12:02.779 --> 12:04.447
That is a deal breaker.

12:04.481 --> 12:05.915
Homer Simpson!

12:05.949 --> 12:07.783
I would like to
congratulate you

12:07.818 --> 12:09.285
on your fine
officiating today.

12:09.319 --> 12:10.519
Thanks.

12:10.554 --> 12:12.922
I still can't believe
the yellow and red cards

12:12.956 --> 12:14.757
don't stand for
mustard and ketchup.

12:14.791 --> 12:17.193
Your disbelief
will fade with time.

12:17.227 --> 12:19.195

like to know

I left my cell phone.

Well?

You don't know the new me

We will get to him.

We have our ways.

12:38.381 --> 12:41.884
Well, what other ways
besides guns and money?

12:41.918 --> 12:43.619
We have two ways.

12:43.653 --> 12:44.954
Two very good ways.

the gamblers sent up

19:47.518 --> 19:49.486
I do have a mother.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.887
Oh, she's right there.

19:50.921 --> 19:52.622
I'm sorry,
my son.

19:52.657 --> 19:54.858
We owe a debt
to the Simpsons

19:54.892 --> 19:56.559
that can never
be repaid.

19:56.594 --> 19:59.262
All that she did was
switch seats on a plane.

19:59.297 --> 20:01.298
On a 15-hour
flight!

20:02.366 --> 20:03.667
You are
free to go.

20:03.701 --> 20:05.669
(dirge playing)

20:05.703 --> 20:08.204
No penalty.

20:08.239 --> 20:09.806
Fine.

20:14.061 --> 20:16.062
(birds squawking)

20:19.033 --> 20:21.968
Wow, the Amazon is
just like I pictured it

20:22.002 --> 20:24.337
after seeing all
those pictures online.

20:24.371 --> 20:27.907
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

20:27.942 --> 20:30.677
(chainsaw buzzing)

20:30.711 --> 20:32.245
The best thing is

20:32.279 --> 20:34.247
I can get locally-
sourced monkey meat.

20:34.281 --> 20:35.915
(hooting)

20:35.950 --> 20:37.016
(shrieks)

20:37.051 --> 20:38.151
Okay, Teeny.

20:38.185 --> 20:40.954
Take care
of part two.

20:40.988 --> 20:42.021
(gun cocks)

20:42.056 --> 20:44.057
(hooting, grunting)

Shh!
