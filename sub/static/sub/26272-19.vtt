00:13.328 --> 00:15.081
Christopher Lankford.

00:15.497 --> 00:17.432
I'm coming for you.

00:44.213 --> 00:46.458
I've got a gun aimed
at the back of your seat.

00:46.482 --> 00:48.850
So... no more screaming.

00:49.323 --> 00:51.263
All right?

00:51.287 --> 00:53.298
Right.

00:53.322 --> 00:54.956
Hands where I can see 'em.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.402
What do you-what do you want...

00:57.426 --> 00:59.571
you want my wallet? You can have it.

00:59.595 --> 01:01.072
I don't know.

01:01.096 --> 01:03.141
You got two million dollars in there?

01:03.165 --> 01:04.643
You serious?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.945
I'm as serious as Trump's barber.

01:06.969 --> 01:08.603
That's what you owe my client.

01:09.094 --> 01:10.615
So unless you got that in your wallet,

01:10.639 --> 01:12.012
I'm not interested.

01:12.575 --> 01:14.052
Now, on the count of three,

01:14.076 --> 01:16.354
we're both getting out of this car.

01:16.378 --> 01:18.256
Do not try to run away

01:18.280 --> 01:22.194
or you will feel a sharp,
sudden pain in your buttocks.

01:22.218 --> 01:24.150
- Am I being clear?
- Very.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.155
Okay.

01:28.257 --> 01:29.534
Here we go.

01:29.558 --> 01:33.161
One, two, three.

01:36.131 --> 01:39.644
Slow it down. Slow it down.

01:39.668 --> 01:42.214
You're doing great. Just one more thing.

01:42.238 --> 01:43.515
Turn around.

02:00.389 --> 02:02.067
Feel free to stretch out.

02:02.091 --> 02:03.658
Make yourself comfortable.

02:13.769 --> 02:15.747
You couldn't snag him during the day?

02:15.771 --> 02:17.082
It's almost midnight.

02:17.106 --> 02:19.251
Great doing business
with you, too, Hector.

02:19.275 --> 02:21.286
I had to wait for him to come
out of his girlfriend's house.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.755
- You got my money?
- Of course I got your money.

02:23.779 --> 02:25.056
It's in my pocket.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.459
And that's where it's gonna stay
until after I see the guy.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.007
- Okay.

02:37.306 --> 02:38.436
This is him?

02:38.460 --> 02:40.438
That's him.

02:40.462 --> 02:43.408
No. This ain't him.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.111
Definitely not him.

02:46.135 --> 02:48.580
My guy wears a rug.

02:48.604 --> 02:49.948
This guy's hair's organic.

02:50.778 --> 02:52.817
Wait a second. Don't
just walk away, come on.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.152
He-he looks like the guy.

02:54.176 --> 02:55.921
He was where my tipster
said the guy would be.

02:55.945 --> 02:59.037
- I... I think he's the guy.
- He's not the guy.

02:59.481 --> 03:01.326
Hector. Hec-Hector. Hector.

03:01.350 --> 03:02.861
Hec... Listen, listen, seriously?

03:02.885 --> 03:06.498
Seriously, you don't think
that maybe he's the guy?

03:06.522 --> 03:09.034
I lent the man two million dollars.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.258
Believe me, I wish that were him
more than you do.

03:13.134 --> 03:14.706
Okay, fine, all right. He's not the guy.

03:14.730 --> 03:16.975
But what-what do you
suggest I do with him?

03:16.999 --> 03:18.399
That's not my problem.

03:48.063 --> 03:49.374
Hey. How you doing?

03:49.398 --> 03:52.978
Be right back. I got to...
I got to move my car.

03:53.002 --> 03:55.436
Okay? Thanks.

04:08.617 --> 04:10.385
Thank you for coming.

04:13.689 --> 04:15.490
It's been a long time.

04:18.449 --> 04:20.005
You look great.

04:23.032 --> 04:25.010
What are you doing in here, Trent?

04:25.034 --> 04:26.611
Are you not with the Bureau anymore?

04:26.635 --> 04:28.375
The FBI?

04:29.071 --> 04:31.462
I've been out two and a half years now.

04:33.742 --> 04:36.654
You know that thing
when you tell yourself,

04:36.678 --> 04:38.590
"Hey, I'm hanging around with bad guys,

04:38.614 --> 04:40.492
"doing lots of drugs,

04:40.516 --> 04:42.494
"getting intimate
with people I'm not married to,

04:42.518 --> 04:45.253
but it's okay, it's all about the job"?

04:46.355 --> 04:48.433
Then, one day,

04:48.457 --> 04:50.335
you're taking vacation time,

04:50.359 --> 04:52.037
and you're still hanging
around with bad people,

04:52.061 --> 04:53.872
still doing drugs,
still sleeping with people

04:53.896 --> 04:55.320
you're not married to.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.910
I realized that was me.

04:58.934 --> 05:02.614
So I submitted my letter of resignation,

05:02.638 --> 05:05.640
booked three months
at a rehab, and here I am.

05:06.842 --> 05:09.444
Well, not here, but...

05:11.013 --> 05:13.825
W-What about your marriage?
How-how's your son?

05:14.339 --> 05:17.028
Marriage did not survive.

05:17.052 --> 05:19.064
Surprise, surprise.

05:19.088 --> 05:20.732
Me and my boy,

05:20.756 --> 05:22.667
we're like a... a work in progress.

05:22.691 --> 05:23.968
He's nine.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.392
I get him one week a month.

05:27.496 --> 05:29.474
Takes him five days to warm up to me,

05:29.498 --> 05:31.409
so the sixth day is always great.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.268
And then the seventh,
he goes back to his mom.

05:35.943 --> 05:37.816
And h-how about you? How about your life?

05:37.840 --> 05:39.484
I hear you're
working for some kind of, uh,

05:39.508 --> 05:42.087
superlawyer. Which, frankly, is

05:42.111 --> 05:44.122
something I could use.

05:44.535 --> 05:47.325
Well... he's not superlawyer.

05:47.349 --> 05:49.427
He's not even a lawyer, really.

05:49.451 --> 05:52.209
But can we just start from the beginning?

05:52.621 --> 05:54.299
Why are you in here?

05:54.323 --> 05:55.967
You, uh, you got a pencil?

05:55.991 --> 05:57.836
It's quite a list.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.471
I got a good memory.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.906
Kidnapping. False imprisonment.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.041
<i>Assault and battery,</i>

06:03.065 --> 06:06.111
- menacing in the second degree...
- He pulled a gun?

06:06.135 --> 06:08.246
...reckless endangerment and, lastly,

06:08.270 --> 06:09.747
assault with attempt to kill.

06:10.772 --> 06:12.383
Let me get this straight.

06:12.855 --> 06:14.686
He threatened the guy with a firearm

06:14.710 --> 06:16.855
and then threw him
in the trunk of his car?

06:16.879 --> 06:18.256
The gun wasn't actually loaded.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.858
Easy to say, hard to prove.

06:19.882 --> 06:22.260
Well, the real guy...
the guy he thought he was

06:22.284 --> 06:24.662
throwing in his car,
Christopher Lankford...

06:24.686 --> 06:26.431
is under suspicion for
a string of violent

06:26.455 --> 06:28.700
home invasion robberies
and armed holdups.

06:28.724 --> 06:30.068
It's not like he could just
throw him in the back seat

06:30.092 --> 06:31.959
and tell him to sit still.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.873
It was an honest mistake.

06:34.897 --> 06:36.007
He got a bad tip.

06:36.031 --> 06:37.542
And he's willing to make it right.

06:37.566 --> 06:40.778
He's willing to pay
for the medical bills,

06:40.802 --> 06:42.680
the-the lost wages.

06:42.704 --> 06:44.983
And he's been doing this
kind of thing for how long?

06:45.007 --> 06:46.217
What, being a bounty hunter?

06:46.241 --> 06:47.519
Or, as they call it
here in New York State,

06:47.543 --> 06:48.976
a bail recovery agent?

06:51.213 --> 06:52.557
This was his first job.

06:53.229 --> 06:54.459
Seriously?

06:54.483 --> 06:56.928
He's been licensed for over a year.

06:56.952 --> 06:58.463
But it's hard getting started.

06:58.487 --> 07:00.298
You need a bail bondsman
to believe in you,

07:00.322 --> 07:01.833
give you a break.

07:01.857 --> 07:04.659
So how has he been making a
living since he left the Bureau?

07:06.028 --> 07:08.039
A process server, private investigator,

07:08.063 --> 07:10.041
private security detail, bodyguard.

07:10.065 --> 07:11.976
Just waiting for his shot.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.678
And this was it.

07:13.702 --> 07:15.480
<i>Thing is, he's a really good person.</i>

07:16.085 --> 07:17.471
He was my mentor.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.119
Taught me everything I know.

07:21.143 --> 07:22.554
<i>So...</i>

07:22.578 --> 07:24.455
what is it, exactly, he wants?

07:24.479 --> 07:25.844
Help.

07:27.816 --> 07:30.595
For maybe you to get involved?

07:31.058 --> 07:32.925
Or at the very least,
point him toward someone

07:32.949 --> 07:33.958
who can get in there

07:33.983 --> 07:35.400
- and fight for him...
- Let me do this.

07:35.424 --> 07:37.569
I'm heading down
to the courthouse anyway.

07:37.593 --> 07:39.470
Text me the name
of the prosecutor who filed

07:39.494 --> 07:41.839
the charges, and I will
try and have a conversation

07:41.863 --> 07:43.741
with him or her, see how dug in they are,

07:43.765 --> 07:45.614
but I am not holding out a lot of hope.

07:46.573 --> 07:49.047
How long has it been since
you've seen this guy,

07:49.071 --> 07:51.539
heard from this guy,
thought about this guy?

07:52.641 --> 07:54.619
- At least three years.
- Great.

07:54.643 --> 07:55.954
Then you won't hate me forever

07:55.978 --> 07:58.585
if, after I talk to the A.D.A., I pass.

08:03.085 --> 08:05.063
Dr. Bull?

08:05.087 --> 08:06.331
Dr. Jason Bull

08:06.355 --> 08:09.033
I'm A.D.A. Conway.
My intern gave me your message.

08:09.057 --> 08:10.602
This is a real honor.

08:10.626 --> 08:13.871
Ah. A.D.A. Conway.

08:13.895 --> 08:15.847
N... Nice to meet you.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.709
I've never seen you around here before.

08:17.733 --> 08:20.912
Uh, thanks for making the time to see me.

08:20.936 --> 08:23.548
Well, I'm a new hire.
I started just after New Year's.

08:23.572 --> 08:25.917
Well, I was wondering
if we could discuss the charges

08:25.941 --> 08:27.919
you brought against Trent Bolton.

08:27.943 --> 08:29.654
Will your firm be involved
in his defense?

08:29.678 --> 08:31.389
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.

08:31.413 --> 08:32.624
He's a friend of a friend.

08:32.648 --> 08:35.793
Let's just consider this
a professional inquiry.

08:35.817 --> 08:37.729
Well, what would you like to know?

08:37.753 --> 08:39.831
I was wondering if there
wasn't some understanding

08:39.855 --> 08:41.099
we could come to.

08:41.123 --> 08:44.168
You mean a deal? A plea deal?

08:44.192 --> 08:45.403
Hypothetically.

08:45.427 --> 08:47.238
That's absurd.

08:48.177 --> 08:49.741
On what basis?

08:49.765 --> 08:52.076
On the basis of the facts.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.745
At the end of the day,
all that really happened here

08:53.769 --> 08:56.668
is Mr. Bolton made an
unfortunate mistake.

08:56.693 --> 08:59.484
A mistake for which he is willing to pay.

08:59.508 --> 09:02.487
And the victim should absolutely
file suit in civil court.

09:02.511 --> 09:04.822
Mr. Bolton freely admits he
caused harm and he stands ready

09:04.846 --> 09:06.557
- to make recompense.
- Excuse me, this man

09:06.581 --> 09:08.159
has made a lot of mistakes.

09:08.183 --> 09:10.028
He threatened a private citizen
with a gun,

09:10.052 --> 09:11.429
then struck that private citizen,

09:11.453 --> 09:13.998
rendering him unconscious,
bound that private citizen,

09:14.022 --> 09:15.633
threw him in the trunk of a car,

09:15.657 --> 09:17.635
and then left him unattended
at a public hospital

09:17.659 --> 09:19.437
while he was still unconscious.

09:19.461 --> 09:22.206
I don't dispute any of that,
but let's be honest here:

09:22.230 --> 09:24.309
if he had caught the right guy...

09:24.333 --> 09:27.345
the guy that terrorized those people,

09:27.369 --> 09:28.680
raped and robbed them

09:28.704 --> 09:30.848
of everything they own...

09:30.872 --> 09:33.918
well, I don't think the state
would be wasting its time

09:33.942 --> 09:35.420
prosecuting these so-called abuses.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.754
I think they would be celebrating him,

09:36.778 --> 09:38.089
calling him a hero.

09:38.113 --> 09:40.558
I think Michael Bay would be
making a movie about him

09:40.582 --> 09:42.794
and your boss, the D.A., would
be taking pictures with him.

09:42.818 --> 09:45.067
This is a ridiculous conversation.

09:48.695 --> 09:50.454
Can I explain the jury system to you?

09:50.478 --> 09:52.337
Are you even a lawyer?

09:52.361 --> 09:55.173
For all its virtues, it's
a highly unpredictable process,

09:55.197 --> 09:56.774
and I say this as someone
who's been studying it

09:56.798 --> 09:57.975
for over 20 years.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.143
Your point?

09:59.706 --> 10:02.780
My point is that attorneys make deals.

10:02.804 --> 10:04.215
Attorneys on both sides of the case.

10:04.239 --> 10:06.651
Because it takes the unpredictable nature

10:06.675 --> 10:08.419
of the process and does away with it.

10:08.443 --> 10:10.254
It is a bird in the hand.

10:10.278 --> 10:12.657
Not to mention the money
it saves the state

10:12.681 --> 10:14.559
and the people they're prosecuting.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.861
Making a deal...

10:17.599 --> 10:19.163
a good plea deal...

10:19.187 --> 10:23.134
that is something that smart,
seasoned attorneys aspire to.

10:23.158 --> 10:24.502
Well, gosh.

10:24.526 --> 10:26.404
As I just explained to you,

10:26.428 --> 10:28.473
I just got off the bus, Dr. Bull.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.274
How would I know any of that?

10:30.298 --> 10:33.878
And I will admit
that I didn't season myself

10:33.902 --> 10:35.146
before I came in to work today.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.548
And it would be immodest, I think,

10:37.572 --> 10:40.651
to refer to myself as smart.

10:40.675 --> 10:43.711
So let's just cut to the chase,
Mr. Older and Wiser.

10:44.867 --> 10:46.011
Make me an offer.

10:46.503 --> 10:47.792
Well, with the caveat that

10:47.816 --> 10:49.927
I don't officially represent Mr. Bolton

10:49.951 --> 10:53.197
and would have to run
anything we agree on by him,

10:53.969 --> 10:56.467
I would ask that you dismiss
the criminal charges

10:56.491 --> 11:00.138
and we move this case to civil court.

11:00.476 --> 11:01.773
Okay.

11:01.797 --> 11:05.176
And I would be willing
to take the 30-year sentence

11:05.200 --> 11:07.645
that I believe he actually deserves

11:07.669 --> 11:11.338
and cut it down to... 29.

11:14.709 --> 11:16.320
Would you like me to repeat that?

11:16.344 --> 11:19.090
No, I put fresh batteries
in my hearing aid this morning,

11:19.114 --> 11:20.412
I heard you just fine.

11:20.816 --> 11:22.894
I'll see you in court, A.D.A. Conway.

11:22.918 --> 11:25.329
Well, if you decide to take the case.

11:25.353 --> 11:26.831
Actually...

11:27.252 --> 11:28.789
I just made my decision.

11:30.492 --> 11:36.019
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

11:45.793 --> 11:48.508
Mr. Bolton. My name is Dr. Jason Bull.

11:48.552 --> 11:50.576
This is Benjamin Colón.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.010
He's a very experienced
criminal attorney,

11:53.034 --> 11:54.545
and the man that I would appoint

11:54.569 --> 11:55.816
to represent you in court,

11:55.817 --> 11:57.492
should you choose to allow our firm

11:57.516 --> 11:59.564
to provide council in your case.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.798
Should I choose?

12:02.190 --> 12:05.370
That implies I have
another option, which I don't.

12:05.394 --> 12:06.771
I'm grateful that you're here.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.674
Grateful that Danny was able
to persuade you to come.

12:09.698 --> 12:11.365
Those bruises look fresh.

12:12.327 --> 12:14.850
Guys had a little welcome party
for me last night.

12:14.851 --> 12:16.796
They somehow found out
I used to be in the Bureau,

12:16.820 --> 12:18.931
and that always
brings out the playfulness

12:18.955 --> 12:20.867
in the prison population.

12:20.891 --> 12:22.201
We'll make some phone calls.

12:22.225 --> 12:25.405
See if we can't get you moved to solitary

12:25.429 --> 12:27.596
or a higher-security wing.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.545
You do understand... how much
trouble you're in, don't you?

12:32.569 --> 12:34.514
I spoke with the A.D.A. and...

12:34.538 --> 12:37.784
she's thinking she might be able
to put you away for 30 years.

12:38.741 --> 12:41.287
Look, I'm willing to do anything
I can to make this right.

12:41.311 --> 12:43.556
Pay doctor bills, anything else...

12:43.580 --> 12:46.426
Danny communicated that
to us and Dr. Bull shared that

12:46.450 --> 12:48.828
- with the A.D.A...
- And she wasn't much interested.

12:49.293 --> 12:51.898
She just wants to see you behind bars.

12:52.129 --> 12:54.100
Now, look.

12:54.124 --> 12:56.608
I don't know you.
Mr. Colón doesn't know you.

12:57.232 --> 13:00.840
We're here because Danny James
says you're a good man.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.708
20 years with the FBI

13:02.732 --> 13:04.877
seems like a pretty honorable way

13:04.901 --> 13:06.518
of making a living.

13:07.237 --> 13:09.449
But the fact remains...

13:09.473 --> 13:12.085
what you did to that fella...

13:12.691 --> 13:14.120
it's pretty horrific.

13:14.144 --> 13:18.024
And it is not gonna be an easy task

13:18.048 --> 13:20.116
to get a jury to see past it.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.795
I get that.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.564
But it's a rough trade, bounty hunting.

13:25.162 --> 13:26.532
When a bail bondsman puts up money

13:26.556 --> 13:28.101
to get someone out of jail...
in this case,

13:28.125 --> 13:29.669
a couple of million dollars...

13:29.693 --> 13:31.604
there's a contract they have to sign.

13:31.628 --> 13:33.539
They have to agree to waive
a lot of the rights

13:33.563 --> 13:35.208
we all take for granted.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.576
Yeah, including the rights

13:36.600 --> 13:38.744
not to be handcuffed,
threatened at gunpoint

13:38.768 --> 13:40.780
- and thrown into a trunk.
- Problem is, the man

13:40.804 --> 13:43.372
who agreed to all of that
is not the man you attacked.

13:46.143 --> 13:48.020
Any idea who gave you the bad tip?

13:48.602 --> 13:50.690
I'm guessing someone connected
to Christopher Lankford,

13:50.714 --> 13:53.926
but... No, I-I... I have no idea.

13:53.950 --> 13:57.110
And it's tough for me
to investigate from in here.

13:57.888 --> 13:59.071
Well...

14:00.614 --> 14:02.401
I'm not gonna lie to you.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.071
We'll do the best we can,
but it's gonna be

14:05.095 --> 14:06.672
an uphill battle.

14:06.696 --> 14:08.808
Like I said, I'm grateful for the help.

14:08.832 --> 14:10.776
C-Can I ask you for one more favor?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.613
Uh, this is my ex-wife's number.

14:13.637 --> 14:14.981
Can you give her a call?

14:15.005 --> 14:17.150
Tell her what's going on?
I don't want my son to worry

14:17.174 --> 14:19.742
or to think his dad forgot him.

14:23.470 --> 14:24.763
Sure thing.

14:25.849 --> 14:27.693
I'll see you in court
tomorrow, Mr. Bolton.

14:27.717 --> 14:29.495
See you in court tomorrow.

14:29.519 --> 14:31.998
So what's on the
grocery list today, boss?

14:32.022 --> 14:33.733
Frontier pragmatists.

14:33.757 --> 14:36.402
Frontier pragmatists.
Never heard of them.

14:36.426 --> 14:39.172
Jurors who can see that the role
Trent serves in society...

14:39.196 --> 14:41.574
dispensing rough but necessary justice...

14:41.598 --> 14:43.643
is essential to keeping us safe.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.278
Frontier pragmatists see the world

14:45.302 --> 14:46.913
for what it is,
not how they wish it to be.

14:46.937 --> 14:48.681
And they understand to get the job done,

14:48.705 --> 14:50.917
sometimes you need
to use any means necessary.

14:50.941 --> 14:52.351
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

14:52.875 --> 14:55.788
Says here that you are married.
Any children?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.323
- Just one at the moment.
- All right.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.158
Okay. Now, I don't mean to pry,

14:59.182 --> 15:01.994
but were you home
when your wife went into labor?

15:02.018 --> 15:04.197
As a matter of fact, I wasn't.
I was at the office

15:04.221 --> 15:06.299
- in an important meeting.
- And how did she

15:06.323 --> 15:08.534
reach out to you... phone, text?

15:08.558 --> 15:10.303
Text. All caps.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.505
Ah. And then what did you do?

15:12.529 --> 15:15.341
I stood up and I said,
"Excuse me, everyone.

15:15.365 --> 15:17.443
I need to leave.
My wife's having a baby."

15:17.467 --> 15:19.145
That sounds about right.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.414
And what did you do next...
did you run home?

15:21.438 --> 15:23.849
Well, sort of. Home is in Queens.

15:23.873 --> 15:27.386
So, no time to use my phone
or get a ridesharing service

15:27.410 --> 15:28.888
or even take the subway.

15:28.912 --> 15:30.690
I just hit the streets
and tried to grab a cab.

15:30.714 --> 15:31.891
And were you successful?

15:31.915 --> 15:33.693
A cab did pull over,

15:33.717 --> 15:36.095
but truthfully, didn't pull over for me.

15:36.119 --> 15:37.597
Uh, but I didn't care. I mean,

15:37.621 --> 15:39.665
I pushed the people that it was
intended for out of the way

15:39.689 --> 15:42.034
and jumped inside and quickly

15:42.058 --> 15:43.269
closed the door behind me.

15:44.594 --> 15:46.172
I-I felt bad, but...

15:46.196 --> 15:48.063
But sometimes life happens.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.977
Your Honor, the defense
approves of this juror.

15:54.404 --> 15:57.183
But we can't focus only
on the frontier pragmatism,

15:57.207 --> 15:58.818
we need to identify jurors who would be

15:58.842 --> 16:02.255
likely to embrace our
mistake of fact defense.

16:02.279 --> 16:04.056
People who are willing to forgive those

16:04.080 --> 16:05.191
who make reasonable mistakes,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.827
regardless of the consequences.

16:07.851 --> 16:10.963
Okay. It is Thursday night,

16:10.987 --> 16:13.733
you go to your favorite
neighborhood restaurant,

16:13.757 --> 16:15.268
you're a local there.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.503
They treat you well, the food is good.

16:17.527 --> 16:19.071
Prices are reasonable,

16:19.095 --> 16:22.475
many of the dishes go from
ten to 12 to 14 dollars.

16:22.499 --> 16:24.744
But the waiter comes over to your table

16:24.768 --> 16:26.312
and says there's a special that night.

16:26.336 --> 16:27.680
Pasta with truffles.

16:27.704 --> 16:30.549
Huh? Sounds good. You order it,
- Mmm.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.218
You eat it, you love it.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.220
But then the bill comes.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.856
Turns out that special was $45.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.759
Four times more than anything
else on the menu.

16:39.783 --> 16:41.360
What do you do?

16:41.384 --> 16:42.828
The waiter didn't tell me the price?

16:42.852 --> 16:44.230
No, but you didn't ask.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.631
So what do you do?

16:45.655 --> 16:49.068
Do you pay the bill, do you make a fuss?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.704
I-I might make a bit of a fuss,

16:51.728 --> 16:53.939
but... I'm gonna pay the bill.

16:53.963 --> 16:55.741
I ate the food.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.911
And since I didn't ask the price...

16:58.935 --> 17:02.504
I guess it's as much my fault
as it is the waiter's.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.151
Your Honor, this juror

17:05.175 --> 17:06.919
is acceptable to the defense.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.121
Very well, then. We have our jury.

17:09.145 --> 17:10.690
Let's adjourn for lunch and then

17:10.714 --> 17:12.892
commence with opening arguments.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.827
Good morning, Dr. Bull.

17:14.851 --> 17:17.663
Ah, A.D.A. Conway.

17:17.686 --> 17:20.189
Frontier pragmatists, huh?

17:21.523 --> 17:24.002
I'm sorry, I've never heard
that expression before.

17:24.027 --> 17:26.806
Never mind. Just a hunch.
I'll see you after the break.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.997
See you after the break.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.413
I want to talk about common sense

17:34.437 --> 17:35.704
for a moment.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.750
What does that mean...

17:38.206 --> 17:39.833
"common sense"?

17:40.377 --> 17:42.722
I think it sort of means

17:42.746 --> 17:44.724
"a shared sense."

17:44.748 --> 17:48.594
Ideas and understandings
that we all have in common.

17:48.618 --> 17:51.831
They're so basic. They're so obvious.

17:51.855 --> 17:53.499
For instance,

17:53.523 --> 17:55.167
if you're walking down the street,

17:55.191 --> 17:58.738
minding your own business,
and someone accosts you,

17:58.762 --> 18:00.639
someone waves a weapon in your face,

18:00.663 --> 18:02.641
someone holds you against your will,

18:02.665 --> 18:05.611
your common sense tells you
this isn't right,

18:06.026 --> 18:08.414
this shouldn't be allowed to happen.

18:08.438 --> 18:11.016
We, as a society, can't permit

18:11.040 --> 18:14.620
whatever excuses
and explanations are offered up

18:14.644 --> 18:17.390
to cloud our thinking, to distract us

18:17.414 --> 18:19.825
from what our common sense tells us

18:19.849 --> 18:22.094
is an unmistakable truth:

18:22.709 --> 18:24.964
that people should be able
to live their lives

18:24.988 --> 18:28.134
without fear of strangers striking them,

18:28.158 --> 18:29.335
knocking them unconscious

18:29.359 --> 18:31.871
and holding them against their will.

18:31.895 --> 18:34.974
It's just common sense.

18:35.597 --> 18:37.510
Now, during the course of the trial,

18:37.534 --> 18:40.980
I'll be offering you evidence
of what the accused has done.

18:41.004 --> 18:42.481
In many ways,

18:42.505 --> 18:45.084
this really isn't necessary.

18:45.108 --> 18:46.919
He's already admitted to it.

18:47.692 --> 18:50.289
Of course, the defense
is gonna tell you otherwise.

18:50.313 --> 18:52.391
They're gonna try and
convince you that sometimes

18:52.415 --> 18:54.460
it's okay to strike a stranger,

18:54.484 --> 18:56.328
to throw them in the trunk of your car,

18:56.352 --> 18:59.198
to leave them unconscious and alone.

18:59.997 --> 19:02.735
They're gonna try and get you

19:02.759 --> 19:04.737
to ignore the obvious,

19:04.761 --> 19:07.006
ignore the simple truth,

19:07.030 --> 19:08.296
ignore...

19:09.381 --> 19:11.257
your common sense.

19:12.702 --> 19:14.427
Don't let them.

19:15.971 --> 19:17.673
Thank you.

19:18.775 --> 19:20.352
She's good.

19:20.376 --> 19:21.510
Hmm.

19:28.591 --> 19:30.613
This is one of several
new videos taken from homes

19:30.638 --> 19:32.728
in the area that have video surveillance.

19:33.468 --> 19:35.236
That's you, isn't it?

19:35.965 --> 19:37.283
It certainly is.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.212
And what were you doing when you first

19:39.237 --> 19:40.681
encountered the defendant?

19:40.706 --> 19:43.451
I was leaving my girlfriend's house.

19:43.476 --> 19:45.488
Just gotten in my car.

19:45.513 --> 19:47.824
He was hiding in the back seat.

19:47.824 --> 19:50.296
Told me he had a gun.
Told me to get out of the car.

19:51.128 --> 19:52.472
Were you frightened?

19:52.496 --> 19:54.092
Very much so.

19:54.798 --> 19:57.376
I thought he was a carjacker.
I thought...

19:57.400 --> 19:59.045
I thought I was a dead man.

19:59.069 --> 20:00.941
And what's the next thing you remember?

20:01.752 --> 20:04.464
Got out of the car, saw the gun,

20:04.608 --> 20:07.053
and then he... he clocked me.

20:07.077 --> 20:09.622
- Knocked me out.
- And then?

20:09.646 --> 20:10.957
And then, nothing.

20:10.981 --> 20:13.860
I-I woke up in the... some...

20:13.884 --> 20:15.695
uh, hospital waiting room.

20:15.719 --> 20:18.898
I looked at the clock, realized
three hours had gone by,

20:18.922 --> 20:22.635
and so, you know, I called the police.

20:22.659 --> 20:24.370
And how have you been since?

20:24.394 --> 20:26.305
Have you been able to return to work?

20:26.329 --> 20:29.976
No. No, I haven't. I...

20:30.000 --> 20:32.145
I'm still pretty shook up.

20:32.169 --> 20:35.008
I just took a month's leave.
Hopefully, that'll...

20:35.472 --> 20:39.252
be enough to, uh,
get me back to where I was.

20:39.276 --> 20:42.321
You know. I mean, something...
something like this...

20:42.345 --> 20:43.489
it messes with your head.

20:43.513 --> 20:46.592
And what is it that you do for a living?

20:46.616 --> 20:49.061
I'm a New York City firefighter.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.364
Thank you,

20:51.388 --> 20:54.089
Your Honor. No further questions.

20:55.659 --> 20:57.603
You had to pick a fireman?

20:57.627 --> 20:58.871
Oh,

20:58.895 --> 21:00.540
- Bull...
- Well, that's that.

21:00.564 --> 21:02.308
I mean, he's a fireman.

21:02.332 --> 21:03.910
Women love him. Men want to be him.

21:03.934 --> 21:07.413
Why couldn't he work for the IRS
or the DMV or...

21:07.437 --> 21:08.748
be a used car salesman?

21:08.772 --> 21:10.049
Can she hear me?

21:10.073 --> 21:11.584
- Uh, nope.
- Or a telemarketer?

21:11.608 --> 21:12.975
- Tell her to stop.
- Or a...

21:16.046 --> 21:17.824
Forget I said anything.

21:17.848 --> 21:19.010
Mm-hmm.

21:21.885 --> 21:24.230
Good morning, Mr. Cole.
Just a couple of quick questions

21:24.254 --> 21:26.098
- for the time being.
- Yeah, of course.

21:26.122 --> 21:27.433
Prior to the night in question,

21:27.457 --> 21:29.101
you never met my client, did you?

21:30.730 --> 21:32.638
- Uh... not that I'm aware of.
- Okay.

21:32.662 --> 21:35.408
So you are inclined to agree
with my client's assertion

21:35.432 --> 21:37.577
that this was all just a mistake?

21:37.601 --> 21:39.011
Objection, Your Honor.

21:39.035 --> 21:40.580
Counsel is calling for speculation.

21:40.604 --> 21:41.781
Sustained.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.606
My mistake, Your Honor.

21:43.630 --> 21:46.385
Ah. There's that word again.

21:46.409 --> 21:47.887
Mistake.

21:47.911 --> 21:49.222
No further questions at this time.

21:49.246 --> 21:50.810
I'm not amused,

21:50.834 --> 21:52.169
Mr. Colón.

21:52.826 --> 21:54.370
Let's take a 15 minute recess.

21:54.786 --> 21:56.138
This witness is excused.

22:01.534 --> 22:04.413
This doesn't work for me.
I can't just sit here.

22:04.437 --> 22:06.682
I need to figure out
who gave you that bad tip

22:06.706 --> 22:09.015
and I need to get you and Benny
more intel on these witnesses.

22:09.039 --> 22:12.147
Mm. Well, you'll get no argument from me.

22:12.812 --> 22:14.829
I know things look bleak right now,

22:14.829 --> 22:16.840
but you're in really great hands.

22:16.864 --> 22:18.875
I'm grateful to be in any hands.

22:18.899 --> 22:20.377
Thank you.

22:20.401 --> 22:22.368
Let's compare notes tonight after court.

22:26.974 --> 22:28.952
I hate this feeling.

22:28.976 --> 22:31.621
I'm going to court every day,
but not getting anywhere.

22:31.645 --> 22:34.591
Making no progress with the jury.

22:34.615 --> 22:37.994
And I feel like I'm being
schooled by that... child.

22:38.018 --> 22:40.597
How old do you think
that A.D.A. is... maybe 11?

22:40.621 --> 22:42.055
She's young.

22:44.792 --> 22:45.936
Glad to see you two.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.871
I was afraid you might not show up.

22:47.895 --> 22:49.439
Oh, no. You don't have another friend

22:49.463 --> 22:51.741
- who's been arrested, do you?
- Remember,

22:51.765 --> 22:53.076
you said you wanted to compare notes.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.578
Well, I've been working all afternoon

22:54.602 --> 22:56.546
and I think I finally found
something I want to show you.

22:56.570 --> 22:58.315
So, I did a bunch of sleuthing

22:58.339 --> 23:00.217
- on Michael Cole, Trent's victim.
- And?

23:00.241 --> 23:02.485
And I found something that
really made me scratch my head.

23:02.509 --> 23:03.587
Okay.

23:03.611 --> 23:05.155
Well, after Trent
dropped Michael Cole off

23:05.179 --> 23:06.823
at the emergency room...

23:07.285 --> 23:08.558
he didn't seek treatment.

23:09.079 --> 23:10.622
Say that again.

23:11.185 --> 23:13.296
Trent said that he left him
in the emergency room,

23:13.320 --> 23:15.832
and the hospital surveillance
video that I'm about to show you

23:15.856 --> 23:17.534
confirms that, but...

23:17.558 --> 23:19.436
he never sought treatment.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.137
That doesn't make any sense.

23:21.161 --> 23:22.939
Guy was unconscious for hours.

23:22.963 --> 23:24.364
Watch this.

23:25.900 --> 23:28.501
According to the time stamp,
this is 1:47 in the morning.

23:30.271 --> 23:32.916
Now I'm going to advance the tape.

23:33.327 --> 23:35.595
This is exactly almost
three minutes later.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.561
What the hell?

23:44.585 --> 23:46.529
Three minutes after Trent left...

23:46.553 --> 23:49.065
he opens his eyes, gets up,

23:49.089 --> 23:50.767
and walks out.

23:50.791 --> 23:51.935
What are we saying?

23:51.959 --> 23:54.271
Are we saying maybe
he wasn't unconscious?

23:54.295 --> 23:57.297
And if we're saying that...
what else are we saying?

24:05.849 --> 24:08.961
Gentlemen. Good morning.

24:08.985 --> 24:11.530
Oh, my goodness, she's not
only an attorney at law,

24:11.554 --> 24:13.088
she is a greeter.

24:14.257 --> 24:16.035
He gets cranky in the morning.

24:16.059 --> 24:17.370
Can we help you with something?

24:17.856 --> 24:20.740
The two of you still interested
in discussing a deal?

24:20.764 --> 24:22.174
When you say deal...

24:22.198 --> 24:24.777
I was contemplating a 25-year sentence,

24:24.801 --> 24:26.912
eligible for parole after 18,

24:26.936 --> 24:30.449
in recognition of your client's
years of service to the FBI.

24:30.473 --> 24:33.119
Well, that's awfully reasonable
of you, A.D.A. Conway.

24:33.143 --> 24:34.954
Heck, we're only 25 years
apart on sentencing.

24:34.978 --> 24:37.456
Cranky. Let us chew on it,

24:37.480 --> 24:39.025
discuss it with our client.

24:39.049 --> 24:40.192
By all means.

24:40.216 --> 24:42.261
A.D.A. Conway, can I ask you something?

24:42.285 --> 24:43.763
Was there anything in
particular that brought on

24:43.787 --> 24:45.131
this sudden change of heart?

24:45.155 --> 24:48.334
Oh. I was just
thinking about what you said

24:48.358 --> 24:49.835
that first day we met.

24:49.859 --> 24:52.605
About juries, how they're fickle.

24:52.629 --> 24:55.007
It's my first really big case.
That bird in the hand

24:55.031 --> 24:57.132
is starting to look
better and better to me.

24:58.314 --> 25:00.325
The wisdom of our elders.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.550
Hmm.

25:10.847 --> 25:13.826
- She's spooked.
- Sure seems that way.

25:13.850 --> 25:16.095
What does she know?
And do we know it too?

25:16.119 --> 25:18.364
And if not, why not?
And what else don't we know?

25:18.388 --> 25:20.833
You think maybe she saw the tape
from the hospital?

25:20.857 --> 25:23.402
That's got to be it. But how?

25:23.426 --> 25:25.838
Danny goes to get it from whoever,

25:25.862 --> 25:28.441
and maybe that same whoever
thinks there's a buck to be made

25:28.465 --> 25:31.510
by tipping off the other side.
Wouldn't be the first time.

25:31.534 --> 25:33.813
She's gonna give us the bum's rush.

25:33.837 --> 25:36.382
She wants to get this thing over
as quickly as possible.

25:36.406 --> 25:38.684
The longer it goes,
the more we will learn,

25:38.708 --> 25:41.654
and she's betting the weaker
her case will get, so...

25:41.678 --> 25:43.522
that is why she's willing to make a deal.

25:43.546 --> 25:45.758
We're gonna get in there
and she is gonna rest her case

25:45.782 --> 25:47.226
and we're gonna be caught flat-footed.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.322
So...

25:49.719 --> 25:52.665
let's put Trent on the stand to stall

25:52.689 --> 25:55.457
and make sure the team's
ready to work late tonight.

25:59.062 --> 26:02.508
Your Honor, at this time,
the prosecution rests.

26:02.532 --> 26:04.009
You ready for this?

26:04.033 --> 26:06.812
Dr. Bull, I've testified
dozens of times as a Fed

26:06.836 --> 26:08.147
and have nothing to hide.

26:08.171 --> 26:10.009
I made a mistake, pure and simple.

26:11.553 --> 26:14.019
Your Honor, the defense
would like to call

26:14.043 --> 26:16.489
Trent Bolton to the stand.

26:16.513 --> 26:18.591
<i>To be a bounty hunter in New York State,</i>

26:18.615 --> 26:20.292
<i>you have to be asked to the dance.</i>

26:20.316 --> 26:22.027
Even after you get your training,

26:22.051 --> 26:23.863
even after you've been certified,

26:23.887 --> 26:26.232
if a bail bondsman doesn't have
someone skip out on them

26:26.256 --> 26:28.000
and doesn't ask you
to go after that person,

26:28.024 --> 26:29.301
you're not working.

26:29.325 --> 26:31.570
Not as a bounty hunter, anyway.

26:31.594 --> 26:33.405
So let me get this straight.

26:33.429 --> 26:36.709
Someone gets arrested, someone
like this Chris Lankford fellow,

26:36.733 --> 26:39.044
and even though he's committed
all these robberies,

26:39.068 --> 26:40.646
even though there's millions of dollars

26:40.670 --> 26:43.377
in unrecovered money,

26:43.401 --> 26:45.384
diamonds, and artwork,

26:45.408 --> 26:48.053
a judge offers to let him out of jail

26:48.077 --> 26:49.421
while he awaits trial

26:49.445 --> 26:51.690
on two million dollars bail.

26:51.714 --> 26:55.161
So he contacts a bail bondsman
to put up the bail money and...

26:55.185 --> 26:57.062
To guarantee for him
to show up for court.

26:57.086 --> 27:00.232
But in the Lankford case,
no one shows up.

27:00.256 --> 27:03.669
And, of course, now, no one
could find this guy Lankford,

27:03.693 --> 27:06.105
- so the bail bondsman called you.
- I'd been

27:06.129 --> 27:08.641
bugging him for six months
to give me a shot.

27:08.665 --> 27:11.644
It's big money. I just needed
to show him what I could do.

27:12.322 --> 27:14.713
Yeah. Now, what led you

27:14.737 --> 27:17.116
to mistakenly apprehending Mr. Cole?

27:17.140 --> 27:19.785
First thing I did, soon as I got the job,

27:19.809 --> 27:21.754
I did what they call a blast canvas.

27:21.778 --> 27:23.255
I went to Lankford's

27:23.279 --> 27:27.193
known haunts,
spoke to his known associates,

27:27.217 --> 27:29.895
spread the word that
I-I've been looking for him.

27:29.919 --> 27:32.031
Pretty much standard operating procedure,

27:32.055 --> 27:34.767
whether you're an FBI agent
or a bounty hunter.

27:34.791 --> 27:35.935
And then what happened?

27:35.959 --> 27:39.071
Then, the next day,
eureka... I get a call.

27:39.095 --> 27:41.707
Anonymous.
Gives me an address, I go over,

27:41.731 --> 27:43.776
and there he is.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.111
Except of course, it isn't him.

27:46.135 --> 27:48.247
Sure looks like him, but it wasn't him.

27:48.271 --> 27:49.682
So what did you do?

27:50.318 --> 27:52.484
What did you do as soon as you realized

27:52.508 --> 27:54.153
you had the wrong guy?

27:54.177 --> 27:56.355
- I brought him to a hospital.
- Mm.

27:56.379 --> 27:58.224
It was... it was, like,

27:58.248 --> 28:00.474
1:30 in the morning. I didn't
know what else to do.

28:00.498 --> 28:02.061
Plus, I hit him once, and it seemed like

28:02.085 --> 28:03.998
he had been unconscious forever.

28:04.621 --> 28:06.865
I... I...

28:06.889 --> 28:08.901
I really started to get worried.

28:08.925 --> 28:10.669
So you were concerned for him?

28:11.130 --> 28:12.338
Very.

28:12.673 --> 28:15.341
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

28:15.365 --> 28:17.309
Marissa, tell me we're making a dent.

28:17.333 --> 28:20.246
Barely a dent, more like a ding.
We've got two green jurors,

28:20.270 --> 28:23.138
otherwise, everything
I'm looking at in here is red.

28:26.342 --> 28:28.053
Just one question,

28:28.077 --> 28:30.022
Mr. Bolton.

28:30.046 --> 28:33.759
Before you decided to render
an innocent man unconscious,

28:33.783 --> 28:35.961
did it occur to you to simply ask him

28:35.985 --> 28:37.763
if he was Chris Lankford?

28:37.787 --> 28:39.698
With all due respect, Miss,

28:39.722 --> 28:41.600
over the course of my career,

28:41.624 --> 28:44.270
I've probably handled 100 apprehensions.

28:44.294 --> 28:47.973
Until this case,
I've never gotten the wrong man.

28:47.997 --> 28:51.110
But, to a person, every one
of the people I've brought in

28:51.134 --> 28:52.444
have sworn up and down

28:52.468 --> 28:54.813
they weren't the fellow
I was looking for.

28:54.837 --> 28:58.350
Except, every single time, they were.

28:58.719 --> 29:01.220
That's very reassuring,

29:01.244 --> 29:03.756
but this time... you were wrong.

29:04.173 --> 29:05.440
Weren't you?

29:05.730 --> 29:07.526
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

29:07.550 --> 29:09.561
I'll withdraw the
question, Your Honor, and I have

29:09.585 --> 29:11.219
nothing else at this time.

29:13.401 --> 29:14.933
I know you didn't ask,

29:14.957 --> 29:17.036
but we are down to one green over here.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.948
I didn't ask.

29:24.193 --> 29:25.737
Wow.

29:25.968 --> 29:27.946
Okay, I'll ask.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.078
What's everybody so damn happy about?

29:31.841 --> 29:34.653
You didn't order lobster
for dinner again, did you?

29:34.677 --> 29:38.390
I finally know who called Trent
and gave him the false tip.

29:38.414 --> 29:40.426
- Do tell.
- And I

29:40.450 --> 29:42.461
figured out where the call was made from.

29:42.485 --> 29:43.696
You don't say.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.597
And I think we now know
why the bail bondsman

29:45.621 --> 29:47.433
hired Trent in the first place.

29:47.457 --> 29:49.935
And Danny also found out
some things about the victim,

29:49.959 --> 29:51.570
Michael Cole, that I think

29:51.594 --> 29:54.740
are gonna make you both very happy.

29:54.764 --> 29:57.309
Ah. Remember happy?

29:57.333 --> 30:00.302
That's the one where your mouth
go up at the ends, right?

30:08.757 --> 30:12.300
The defense would like to recall
Michael Cole to the stand. me,

30:13.393 --> 30:15.379
<i>Nice to see you again,</i> Mr. Cole.

30:16.783 --> 30:17.863
Okay.

30:17.887 --> 30:19.640
So here's something

30:19.640 --> 30:21.607
I don't think the jury knows.

30:21.608 --> 30:24.387
You're not just
a New York City firefighter,

30:24.411 --> 30:26.122
you're an MMA fighter as well.

30:26.146 --> 30:27.323
And cue the A.D.A.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.292
Objection. Relevance?

30:29.316 --> 30:30.860
Your Honor, you have my word,

30:30.884 --> 30:32.862
it won't take more than 30 seconds for me

30:32.886 --> 30:35.197
to make the relevance completely obvious

30:35.221 --> 30:37.151
to you and the jury.

30:37.624 --> 30:39.602
Objection overruled.

30:39.626 --> 30:42.102
You've got 30 seconds, Mr. Colón.

30:42.126 --> 30:43.706
Thank you, Your Honor, thank you.

30:43.730 --> 30:46.542
Now, we were talking about
your career as an MMA fighter.

30:46.566 --> 30:48.044
Well, it's not a career.

30:48.068 --> 30:49.612
It's-it's a hobby.

30:49.636 --> 30:51.681
That occasionally pays a little money.

30:51.705 --> 30:54.850
Oh. My mistake.

30:54.874 --> 30:58.587
I heard you were retiring from the FDNY,

30:58.611 --> 31:00.690
so I figured your career

31:00.714 --> 31:02.858
as an MMA fighter was taking off.

31:03.302 --> 31:06.195
But apparently, you've come
into money some other way.

31:06.219 --> 31:08.364
Ask a question, Mr. Colón.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.532
Absolutely, your Honor.

31:09.556 --> 31:13.436
So, you're not a full-time MMA fighter,

31:13.460 --> 31:16.639
but you do train as an MMA fighter.

31:16.663 --> 31:17.973
Am I correct?

31:17.997 --> 31:19.141
At a place called

31:19.165 --> 31:21.043
- Pharrell's Training?
- Yes. Yes I do.

31:21.067 --> 31:23.698
And are you aware that Chris Lankford...

31:24.197 --> 31:26.475
the man my client mistook you for...

31:26.500 --> 31:27.877
also trained there?

31:32.324 --> 31:33.535
I think the A.D.A. just experienced

31:33.560 --> 31:35.137
- a growing pain.
- Still waiting

31:35.162 --> 31:36.296
for an answer, Mr. Cole.

31:37.584 --> 31:39.161
No. This is...

31:39.185 --> 31:40.730
this is the first I heard of that.

31:40.754 --> 31:42.020
Ah.

31:44.090 --> 31:47.036
Let me remind you that
you are still under oath, sir.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.338
Once again:

31:49.362 --> 31:52.441
were you aware that Chris Lankford

31:52.465 --> 31:55.200
also worked out at Pharell's Training?

31:55.224 --> 31:57.513
Objection. Asked and answered.

31:57.537 --> 31:58.614
Well, wait, wait.

31:58.638 --> 32:00.182
Uh...

32:00.206 --> 32:01.527
I mean...

32:02.041 --> 32:03.876
I can plead the Fifth, right?

32:05.412 --> 32:07.857
I mean, that's...
that's an option, right?

32:07.881 --> 32:10.292
Well, if you believe your testimony

32:10.316 --> 32:12.628
might be used as evidence against you

32:12.652 --> 32:15.531
in a criminal matter, by all means.

32:15.555 --> 32:18.134
Getting greener in here.

32:18.158 --> 32:19.462
Objection.

32:20.059 --> 32:22.340
To what? And on what grounds?

32:23.910 --> 32:25.154
I don't know?

32:25.179 --> 32:26.642
No, that's all right, Your Honor.

32:26.666 --> 32:27.977
Let me withdraw the question.

32:28.001 --> 32:29.145
Okay.

32:29.169 --> 32:30.598
Let me ask you this.

32:31.070 --> 32:33.816
How many times did my client punch you?

32:33.840 --> 32:35.897
- Once.
- Okay. One punch.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.787
And where did he punch you?

32:37.811 --> 32:40.712
- Right here. You can see it.
- Okay.

32:41.881 --> 32:44.493
So you're a firefighter,

32:44.517 --> 32:46.495
an MMA fighter,

32:46.519 --> 32:49.899
and my client socked you
one time in the chin,

32:49.923 --> 32:51.801
and knocked you out for three hours?

32:51.825 --> 32:54.705
What can I say? I mean, your
client... he packs a mean punch.

32:54.729 --> 32:57.706
Well, can you tell me this:

32:57.730 --> 33:00.009
if my client knocked you out

33:00.033 --> 33:02.511
and left you
in a hospital emergency room,

33:02.535 --> 33:04.914
why, when you came to,

33:04.938 --> 33:06.949
did you not seek any treatment?

33:11.644 --> 33:12.988
I don't know.

33:13.012 --> 33:14.642
You don't know.

33:15.815 --> 33:18.884
Maybe when you came to, you felt okay?

33:20.219 --> 33:22.454
Yes. That's probably it.

33:23.723 --> 33:25.277
And maybe...

33:25.892 --> 33:27.757
you were never unconscious
in the first place.

33:27.781 --> 33:31.474
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

33:31.498 --> 33:33.342
Objection sustained.

33:33.366 --> 33:35.611
Jury will ignore counsel's comment.

33:35.635 --> 33:37.279
No, they won't.

33:37.303 --> 33:38.745
That's what we're counting on.

33:38.769 --> 33:40.716
I have no further questions
for this witness

33:40.740 --> 33:42.318
at this time, Your Honor.

33:42.753 --> 33:45.654
A.D.A. Conway, do you have
any questions for this witness?

33:46.131 --> 33:47.656
Thousands.

33:47.680 --> 33:48.801
Pardon me?

33:50.116 --> 33:52.050
None at this time.

33:53.347 --> 33:54.630
Mr. Colón,

33:54.654 --> 33:56.398
call your next witness.

33:56.422 --> 33:59.368
The defense would like to call
Hector Morales to the stand.

34:00.730 --> 34:03.791
The bail bondsman? Why are they
calling the bail bondsman?

34:05.365 --> 34:07.142
Ah, youth.

34:07.166 --> 34:10.579
So, Mr. Morales, you were

34:10.603 --> 34:13.047
the bail bondsman Chris Lankford called

34:13.072 --> 34:16.018
when he was arraigned
and wished to post bail?

34:16.042 --> 34:18.187
Yes, sir. Two million dollars.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.204
Largest bond I've ever posted.

34:20.228 --> 34:22.558
Largest bond you ever posted.

34:22.581 --> 34:24.860
Wow. But when your client

34:24.884 --> 34:26.594
didn't show up for trial,

34:26.619 --> 34:30.132
you hired a bounty hunter
you had never used before.

34:30.156 --> 34:33.536
In fact, you hired someone
who had never even worked

34:33.560 --> 34:34.870
as a bounty hunter.

34:34.893 --> 34:36.038
Isn't that correct?

34:36.062 --> 34:37.505
Mr. Bolton had been coming at me

34:37.530 --> 34:38.974
for months.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.476
He had something to prove.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.444
And he had 15 years of experience

34:42.467 --> 34:45.080
apprehending criminals for the FBI.

34:45.103 --> 34:48.083
He certainly wasn't a babe in the woods.

34:48.107 --> 34:51.085
I-I... And I know, I know, but still...

34:51.110 --> 34:53.155
why would you send out someone

34:53.179 --> 34:55.190
you had never personally
worked with before

34:55.868 --> 34:57.726
to retrieve a violent criminal

34:57.750 --> 35:01.063
for whom, by your own
admission, you had just posted

35:01.087 --> 35:04.418
the largest bond
in your company's history?

35:05.792 --> 35:08.003
I don't know what to tell you.
It made sense to me at the time.

35:08.027 --> 35:09.872
- Would I do it again?
- Call me crazy,

35:09.896 --> 35:11.206
but I bet you would.

35:11.230 --> 35:12.207
Three,

35:12.231 --> 35:14.043
- two, one...
- Objection,

35:14.067 --> 35:16.545
Your Honor. The defense appears
to be attempting to sway

35:16.569 --> 35:19.315
the jury with inference and
innuendo rather than allowing

35:19.339 --> 35:21.556
the witness's answers to simply stand.

35:21.580 --> 35:22.906
Sustained.

35:22.930 --> 35:26.422
Jury will disregard defense
counsel's last statement.

35:26.446 --> 35:27.923
Mr. Colón,

35:27.947 --> 35:30.192
I need you to pull
this line of questioning

35:30.216 --> 35:32.394
into a cohesive whole that makes sense,

35:32.418 --> 35:35.464
and do it quickly, or I'm going
to have to cut it off.

35:35.488 --> 35:37.132
Absolutely, Your Honor, absolutely.

35:37.156 --> 35:39.335
I just need a minute or so more,

35:39.359 --> 35:42.838
and, uh, I believe things
will become much, much clearer.

35:42.862 --> 35:46.342
The clock is running Mr. Colón.
Ask a question.

35:46.366 --> 35:48.243
Yes, sir. Now, as one of the conditions

35:48.267 --> 35:49.912
of Mr. Lankford's bail,

35:49.936 --> 35:51.814
he had to surrender his passport
to the court, didn't he?

35:51.838 --> 35:53.491
Yes, sir.

35:53.515 --> 35:56.185
Now, sometimes, when you put up bond,

35:56.209 --> 35:58.253
the court doesn't ask for the passport,

35:58.277 --> 36:00.356
but you do. Right?

36:00.380 --> 36:02.358
Sometimes we need that extra assurance

36:02.382 --> 36:04.901
holding someone's passport gives you.

36:04.925 --> 36:06.228
Hmm.

36:06.252 --> 36:08.864
You ever heard the name Nyman Sidah?

36:09.233 --> 36:11.533
May have posted bail for him

36:11.557 --> 36:13.168
maybe four or five years ago?

36:13.192 --> 36:14.303
And, uh,

36:14.327 --> 36:16.672
did you ask him to surrender
his passport at the time?

36:17.116 --> 36:19.775
Could be. I'd have to check my records.

36:19.799 --> 36:22.575
Now, after you posted his bail,
did he show up for trial?

36:22.599 --> 36:25.280
No. My recollection, sadly,

36:25.304 --> 36:28.777
is that he was killed in a car
accident on his way to court.

36:28.801 --> 36:31.312
Terrible, just terrible.

36:31.336 --> 36:33.489
Everybody buckle up.
I sense the captain's

36:33.513 --> 36:35.391
about to put on the seat belt sign.

36:35.885 --> 36:37.526
How much did Chris Lankford pay

36:37.550 --> 36:40.229
for Nyman Sidah's passport?

36:42.255 --> 36:44.059
That's my cue.

36:45.558 --> 36:46.702
I'm sorry.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.871
I didn't hear an answer.

36:48.895 --> 36:51.407
Maybe I should just
rephrase the question.

36:53.199 --> 36:56.478
When Mr. Lankford
approached you about putting up

36:56.502 --> 36:59.314
his two million dollars bail,

36:59.338 --> 37:01.984
how many millions above and beyond that

37:02.008 --> 37:04.253
did he offer for you to provide him

37:04.277 --> 37:06.422
with a passport and a bounty hunter?

37:06.446 --> 37:08.081
A bounty hunter

37:08.105 --> 37:10.092
who would likely fall for the tip

37:10.116 --> 37:12.094
Lankford would call in on himself,

37:12.118 --> 37:14.596
leading him to a paid lookalike

37:14.620 --> 37:16.965
who was willing to fake being

37:16.989 --> 37:19.835
captured and buy him enough time
to leave the country?

37:22.628 --> 37:25.163
Don't object,
just ask for a brief recess.

37:26.685 --> 37:28.243
Your Honor, the prosecution

37:28.267 --> 37:30.379
would like to request a brief recess.

37:30.403 --> 37:31.714
One thing at a time.

37:31.738 --> 37:33.582
The witness will answer the question.

37:33.606 --> 37:35.451
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

37:35.903 --> 37:37.286
Fine, then.

37:37.310 --> 37:38.954
Let's take a 15-minute break

37:38.978 --> 37:40.824
and resume testimony at that time.

37:42.482 --> 37:44.560
You bring me out here
just to say "I told you so"?

37:44.584 --> 37:46.462
Well, first of all, I
didn't say I told you so,

37:46.486 --> 37:48.430
and second of all, no.

37:48.454 --> 37:51.700
That is not why I told you
to ask for a recess.

37:51.724 --> 37:54.069
I brought you out here to tell
you you don't have to lose.

37:54.093 --> 37:56.071
But that if you don't act now,
if you don't do something

37:56.095 --> 37:57.573
before that jury votes, that is exactly

37:57.597 --> 37:59.808
what's gonna happen.

37:59.832 --> 38:02.745
And you are too smart and too special

38:02.769 --> 38:04.646
to fall into that trap.

38:05.182 --> 38:07.516
Well... thank you,

38:07.540 --> 38:10.052
but what makes you so certain

38:10.076 --> 38:11.553
it's gonna go that way?

38:11.577 --> 38:12.988
Do you want to go back in there

38:13.012 --> 38:14.990
and watch my guy finish
filleting this witness?

38:15.014 --> 38:17.593
You want to watch him enter
into evidence a photocopy

38:17.617 --> 38:20.229
of Lankford's passport, which he
used to get out of the country?

38:20.253 --> 38:22.097
It was supplied to us
by Homeland Security.

38:22.121 --> 38:24.433
You want to hear
about the tip my client got

38:24.457 --> 38:26.769
which was from a pay phone
at Kennedy Airport?

38:27.246 --> 38:29.004
We went out there
and we got all the quarters

38:29.028 --> 38:30.672
out of that pay phone,
and what do you know...

38:30.696 --> 38:32.274
Lankford's fingerprints
are on some of them.

38:32.298 --> 38:35.277
Or maybe you want to see
the victim's bank records.

38:35.301 --> 38:37.479
The unexpected, unexplained deposit

38:37.503 --> 38:39.148
of a quarter of a million dollars

38:39.172 --> 38:42.284
the day before my client supposedly

38:42.308 --> 38:46.011
mistakenly abducted this victim.

38:52.251 --> 38:54.630
Just go in, announce you want
to withdraw the charges

38:54.654 --> 38:56.799
against my client and then
have your office immediately

38:56.823 --> 38:59.334
file charges against the
bail bondsman and the fireman.

38:59.358 --> 39:01.370
And who knows... if you
lean on them hard enough,

39:01.394 --> 39:03.172
maybe they'll tell you where Lankford is,

39:03.196 --> 39:05.774
and then you can put him
behind bars once and for all.

39:05.798 --> 39:07.232
And that's a win.

39:08.835 --> 39:11.780
Why are you being so nice to me?

39:11.804 --> 39:13.182
I know.

39:13.206 --> 39:15.284
I'm old, and virtually at death's door,

39:15.308 --> 39:17.119
but I'm hoping to live long
enough to vote for you

39:17.143 --> 39:20.789
when you run for district
attorney in five years or so.

39:20.813 --> 39:22.090
Oh, my God.

39:22.114 --> 39:23.725
I'm sorry, did you say
something? I missed that...

39:23.749 --> 39:25.283
This damn hearing aid.

39:28.515 --> 39:30.732
Thank you. Thank you both so much.

39:30.756 --> 39:32.367
I don't know how I'm
ever gonna repay you.

39:32.391 --> 39:34.970
Don't worry about it.
Call your ex-wife and your son.

39:34.994 --> 39:36.705
- Tell them the good news.
- Will do.

39:36.729 --> 39:38.483
Best of luck to you, Trent.

39:39.232 --> 39:40.909
Hey, uh, do me a favor...

39:40.933 --> 39:42.678
thank Danny for me.

39:42.702 --> 39:44.146
Will do.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.648
I-Is she as great working for
you as when she worked for me?

39:46.672 --> 39:48.250
Hey, Iron Man.

39:48.274 --> 39:49.418
Hey!

39:49.442 --> 39:51.353
I heard the news. I had to come over.

39:51.377 --> 39:52.521
What do I say?

39:52.545 --> 39:54.056
How do I thank you? I...

39:54.080 --> 39:55.691
Oh, Trent, you don't have to thank me.

39:55.715 --> 39:57.092
You've probably saved my life
hundred of times

39:57.116 --> 39:58.794
when I was with the Bureau,
so I'm just happy

39:58.818 --> 40:00.162
to pay down the debt.

40:00.186 --> 40:01.770
- Oh...
- Come on.

40:01.794 --> 40:02.982
- Hey.
- Let's-let's get out of here.

40:03.006 --> 40:04.253
I'll buy you a drink.
