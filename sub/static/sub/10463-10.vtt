WEBVTT

00:04.258 --> 00:05.193
Has anyone seen my...

00:05.217 --> 00:06.278
We're leaving in five minutes.

00:06.302 --> 00:07.654
My plaid shirt and floppy hat?

00:07.678 --> 00:09.614
- I don't wear hats.
- Five minutes!

00:09.638 --> 00:11.106
Claudia!

00:13.142 --> 00:14.119
Claudia!

00:14.143 --> 00:16.036
Semi-naked. Don't come in.

00:16.061 --> 00:17.696
Have you seen my plaid shirt?

00:17.938 --> 00:20.407
Um, I'm not sure.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.294
You mean the red one
with the zipper

00:22.318 --> 00:24.254
and the little stain
on the left sleeve?

00:24.278 --> 00:25.746
Claudia!

00:27.323 --> 00:28.633
- You're dead!
- Hey!

00:28.657 --> 00:30.510
A person's tent is her
castle, you know.

00:30.534 --> 00:31.762
Yeah? Well, you're
being invaded.

00:31.786 --> 00:33.013
What else have you got in here?

00:33.037 --> 00:34.055
This is so humiliating.

00:34.079 --> 00:35.182
My Shawn Colvin CD.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.683
Oh, it has a little scratch.

00:36.707 --> 00:39.436
My thesaurus, my
hoop earrings...

00:39.460 --> 00:40.896
My sports bra?

00:40.920 --> 00:42.230
Hey, a girl can dream.

00:42.254 --> 00:43.899
What are you, a kleptomaniac?

00:43.923 --> 00:45.567
Don't use language like that with me.
I'm 11.

00:45.591 --> 00:47.694
Claudia, a kleptomaniac is
someone who steals things.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.196
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.363
You stole!

00:50.387 --> 00:52.407
Would you have let me take them
if I had asked you nicely?

00:52.431 --> 00:53.575
No.

00:53.599 --> 00:55.994
See? I had no choice.
You drove me to this.

00:56.018 --> 00:58.163
My floppy hat. Claudia,
I'm sick of this.

00:58.187 --> 00:59.956
I wanted to wear this
three times last week.

00:59.980 --> 01:03.117
Personally, I don't think
it does very much for you.

01:03.526 --> 01:05.253
Just stay out of my
stuff, you got it?

01:05.277 --> 01:07.329
God, I'm never going to
forgive you for this.

01:07.780 --> 01:09.164
That seems fair.

01:09.365 --> 01:11.843
All right, well, I want to make sure
you're going to be here Thursday,

01:11.867 --> 01:14.471
so I booked a table for 5:00.
Prime time.

01:14.495 --> 01:16.130
The place to be.

01:16.914 --> 01:19.133
Don't all jump up
and down at once.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.603
I don't know, Joe. It's a
really busy night for you.

01:21.627 --> 01:22.896
Yeah, I mean, we don't want

01:22.920 --> 01:24.898
to take up one of your
tables on Thanksgiving.

01:24.922 --> 01:26.149
Gotcha. Okay.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.400
Well, as long as you promise me

01:27.424 --> 01:28.851
you're going to
celebrate at home.

01:28.884 --> 01:31.446
Actually, we thought we might
just skip it this time around.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.156
Face it, none of us
really knows how to cook.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.824
Well, I'll send stuff from here.

01:34.848 --> 01:35.951
Well, we're kind of busy.

01:35.975 --> 01:37.953
I mean, Charlie's got
this house painting job.

01:37.977 --> 01:39.621
Bailey's got this big paper due.

01:39.645 --> 01:41.706
Anyway, It's more fun
just to watch football.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.417
You don't have to worry about
cooking and cleaning up.

01:44.441 --> 01:45.585
You guys sure?

01:45.609 --> 01:46.711
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:46.735 --> 01:48.078
Yeah. We all decided.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.132
Okay. I'll get a
round of drinks.

01:51.156 --> 01:52.092
Thanks, Joe.

01:52.116 --> 01:55.002
Thanksgiving never was one of
my favorite holidays anyway.

01:55.327 --> 01:56.837
It's kind of dumb.

01:56.912 --> 01:58.557
It's really just about
how these pilgrims

01:58.581 --> 02:00.141
took advantage of the Indians.

02:00.165 --> 02:01.842
- Did you know that?
- Hey, you guys.

02:01.876 --> 02:03.260
Hey, How you doing, Emmett?

02:03.377 --> 02:06.263
- Mind if I join you?
- No. Pull up a chair.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.946
So, I tried to call you guys
at home before you left,

02:12.970 --> 02:14.281
but you had already gone.

02:14.305 --> 02:15.866
I need to talk to you.

02:15.890 --> 02:19.484
I got a phone call this
afternoon at the law firm.

02:20.519 --> 02:22.414
I guess there's no
other way to say this

02:22.438 --> 02:24.114
except to come
straight out with it.

02:24.523 --> 02:27.534
Walter Alcott was released
from prison last week.

02:31.947 --> 02:32.924
He's out?

02:32.948 --> 02:33.925
Already?

02:33.949 --> 02:35.010
The sentence was 18 months.

02:35.034 --> 02:36.344
It hasn't been nearly that long.

02:36.368 --> 02:39.463
He was eligible for parole when
he'd served half his time.

02:39.496 --> 02:40.932
I guess based on
his prison record

02:40.956 --> 02:43.768
and the fact that this
was his first conviction

02:43.792 --> 02:45.645
for drunk driving, that
the board determined...

02:45.669 --> 02:47.063
How could they let him out?

02:47.087 --> 02:48.648
I know it's hard
to believe, honey.

02:48.672 --> 02:50.766
I know it doesn't seem fair.

02:50.883 --> 02:52.319
So that's how things work, huh?

02:52.343 --> 02:54.529
Nine months and he just
gets to walk out of there

02:54.553 --> 02:55.614
like nothing happened?

02:55.638 --> 02:57.282
He killed two people.

02:57.306 --> 03:00.535
I wish I could tell you something
different. There is something else.

03:00.559 --> 03:02.527
I got a request from him
through his lawyer.

03:03.437 --> 03:04.497
A request.

03:04.521 --> 03:07.876
And I want you to know that you're
under no obligation, absolutely none.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.993
He wants to see you.

03:10.527 --> 03:12.297
What?

03:12.321 --> 03:13.757
Why?

03:13.781 --> 03:15.791
I think he'd like a
chance to say he's sorry.

What does that mean,
anyway, "say he's sorry"?

04:04.456 --> 04:06.758
What's he going to do,
explain what happened?

04:07.668 --> 04:09.521
There's nothing for
us to talk about.

04:09.545 --> 04:10.804
I don't know.

04:11.171 --> 04:12.899
What?

04:12.923 --> 04:16.726
Is there anything that he has to say
that you want to hear? An apology?

04:17.094 --> 04:18.238
Give me a break.

04:18.262 --> 04:19.197
Emmett says maybe...

04:19.221 --> 04:21.440
Emmett says that we should
worry about ourselves,

04:21.598 --> 04:22.941
not about this guy.

04:23.851 --> 04:25.861
Walter Alcott...

04:25.894 --> 04:27.205
Maybe it'd be good for us.

04:27.229 --> 04:28.790
Oh, that's a load of crap.

04:28.814 --> 04:30.333
I don't know.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.252
I mean, maybe it kind of
helps you to get past it.

04:32.276 --> 04:36.047
I mean, you see him one time,
that's it, and... you're past it.

04:36.071 --> 04:38.540
Hey, we were all doing
fine before tonight.

04:38.741 --> 04:40.844
I think I can get past it
without looking at his face.

04:40.868 --> 04:42.836
Maybe, but he's always
going to be out there,

04:43.537 --> 04:45.015
and instead of it being
this big question

04:45.039 --> 04:46.766
and us always wondering,

04:46.790 --> 04:48.633
we could close
that door forever.

04:48.751 --> 04:50.437
Are you saying you
want to see him?

04:50.461 --> 04:51.563
I'm not sure.

04:51.587 --> 04:52.814
God!

04:52.838 --> 04:55.515
Bailey, why are you
being so mean?

04:58.927 --> 05:00.822
Look, we've got to decide
one way or the other.

05:00.846 --> 05:01.865
Forget it.

05:01.889 --> 05:04.733
He can shove his apology.
It doesn't do me any good.

05:05.684 --> 05:08.079
All it does is make
him feel better.

05:08.103 --> 05:10.113
Now, you give me one reason
why we should do that.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.909
So he can't sleep at night.
That's fine with me.

05:14.818 --> 05:16.078
Charlie?

05:18.447 --> 05:22.167
- What? -Don't you have anything
to say about this at all?

05:23.077 --> 05:24.503
I'm with Bailey.

05:32.878 --> 05:36.223
We got to all agree, Jule...
all of us.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.476
Okay.

05:42.471 --> 05:43.814
Jule?

06:02.157 --> 06:03.843
What are you doing in here?

06:03.867 --> 06:05.053
Nothing.

06:05.077 --> 06:07.222
You're not messing around
in my stuff again, are you?

06:07.246 --> 06:08.880
No.

06:13.168 --> 06:14.427
Jule?

06:15.587 --> 06:17.264
What was the trial like?

06:17.339 --> 06:19.192
It wasn't a trial.
It was a hearing.

06:19.216 --> 06:20.485
Well, what happened?

06:20.509 --> 06:22.310
Why do you want to
know, Claud, huh?

06:22.344 --> 06:23.854
I just do, okay?

06:24.388 --> 06:26.574
Well, they brought the guy in...

06:26.598 --> 06:27.742
In handcuffs?

06:27.766 --> 06:31.528
Was he in handcuffs?
I don't think so.

06:32.312 --> 06:36.167
And the judge asked
him how did he plead.

06:36.191 --> 06:37.460
He said, "Guilty,"

06:37.484 --> 06:40.380
and the prosecutor
said some stuff,

06:40.404 --> 06:41.881
and his lawyer said some stuff,

06:41.905 --> 06:44.332
and the judge sentenced
him, and that was it.

06:46.785 --> 06:48.054
Did he cry?

06:48.078 --> 06:49.337
Yes.

06:49.997 --> 06:51.599
And was his family there?

06:51.623 --> 06:53.351
I guess so. There was a woman

06:53.375 --> 06:55.802
and a girl who looked like him.

06:56.295 --> 06:57.689
And did he say anything?

06:57.713 --> 06:59.055
Come on, Claud.

06:59.256 --> 07:02.151
We all agreed we were going
to try to forget about this.

07:02.175 --> 07:04.320
You know, I can't
find my blue vest.

07:04.344 --> 07:06.188
You didn't take my
blue vest, did you?

07:06.388 --> 07:09.191
You know, Claudia, I swear, if you
don't stop taking my stuff...

07:09.641 --> 07:10.984
Claud?

07:29.036 --> 07:30.337
Can I help you?

07:30.787 --> 07:32.380
I'm looking for a book.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.517
Well, you're going to have to be

07:34.541 --> 07:36.593
a little more specific
than that, sweetheart.

07:38.503 --> 07:41.973
On, um... on jewelry.

07:42.466 --> 07:45.727
Well, that would be in our hobby
section against the far wall.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.902
Far wall?

07:54.728 --> 07:56.696
Could you maybe help me look?

07:57.981 --> 07:59.908
I can't reach the books on top.

08:03.028 --> 08:04.547
Do you want a coffee table book

08:04.571 --> 08:06.873
or something with more text?

08:08.283 --> 08:09.584
Let's see...

08:11.954 --> 08:14.589
Now, this has some of both.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.804
What do you think about
something like this?

08:27.427 --> 08:29.563
I'm Claudia Salinger.

08:31.139 --> 08:32.899
I'm their youngest daughter.

08:36.979 --> 08:39.197
I just wanted to see
what you look like.

08:51.451 --> 08:53.054
God, you shouldn't
have done that, Claud.

08:53.078 --> 08:54.555
We all agreed we weren't
going to see him.

08:54.579 --> 08:55.515
I know, but...

08:55.539 --> 08:56.975
So then what did you think
you were doing, huh?

08:56.999 --> 08:58.226
Look, if you're not
going to listen...

08:58.250 --> 08:59.676
Hey, lay off her, okay?

09:00.377 --> 09:01.938
You all got to see him.

09:01.962 --> 09:03.805
I never saw him.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.018
I just... I needed to see
what he looked like.

09:11.054 --> 09:13.032
So? How did he look?

09:13.056 --> 09:14.941
Normal, I guess.

09:16.018 --> 09:18.778
He kind of looked pretty nice.
Like anyone.

09:19.479 --> 09:20.947
Like someone you would know.

09:21.356 --> 09:23.251
A little like Amy
Patterson's dad.

09:23.275 --> 09:24.377
Isn't that weird?

09:24.401 --> 09:26.119
What did you think
he'd look like, Claud?

09:26.236 --> 09:30.373
I don't know. Ugly,
kind of mean.

09:31.366 --> 09:33.052
He was nice to people

09:33.076 --> 09:34.419
in his store.

09:34.661 --> 09:39.758
And before he knew who I was...
he called me "sweetheart."

09:39.958 --> 09:41.426
There were people in his store?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.430
So he's, like,
doing pretty well.

09:45.589 --> 09:47.400
I guess. I don't know.

09:47.424 --> 09:49.559
Well, did he seem happy,

09:49.968 --> 09:51.279
like his whole life was okay?

09:51.303 --> 09:52.322
I don't know, Bay.

09:52.346 --> 09:53.948
Well, what did he say when
you told him who you were?

09:53.972 --> 09:55.273
I just left.

09:56.308 --> 09:59.235
You left? I don't get it, Claud.

09:59.394 --> 10:02.874
I just wanted to see him,
just to see his face,

10:02.898 --> 10:05.126
just so I could stop
wondering about him.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.754
That's all. I didn't go
there for an apology,

10:07.778 --> 10:09.746
and I didn't want to
talk to him, okay?

10:10.822 --> 10:12.759
- So now I'm satisfied.
- Claud...

10:12.783 --> 10:14.594
And I don't want to
think about it anymore.

10:14.618 --> 10:16.586
- Claudia...
- Didn't you hear me?

10:18.580 --> 10:20.173
Leave her alone, huh?

10:24.628 --> 10:27.847
He's got his life back.
He's working...

10:28.006 --> 10:30.693
I don't know, he can go
to dinner or see a movie

10:30.717 --> 10:32.936
or take his family somewhere.

10:33.387 --> 10:35.156
Do you really think that, Bay?
I don't.

10:35.180 --> 10:36.898
Well, I don't want
to take the chance.

10:36.932 --> 10:38.284
I mean, he was in
jail for nine months.

10:38.308 --> 10:39.619
Nine months.

10:39.643 --> 10:41.986
That's 4 1/2 months for
each of my parents.

10:42.687 --> 10:44.916
And good behavior? What
is that about, huh?

10:44.940 --> 10:47.117
What did he do? Cure cancer?

10:47.943 --> 10:49.337
I want him to pay
for what he did,

10:49.361 --> 10:50.922
and if it can't be
with more jail time,

10:50.946 --> 10:52.715
then I want him to pay
out of his own pocket.

10:52.739 --> 10:53.841
You want to sue him?

10:53.865 --> 10:55.083
Can we?

10:55.117 --> 10:56.677
Well, yes, technically,

10:56.701 --> 10:58.262
you could file a civil
suit against him.

10:58.286 --> 10:59.680
Then let's do it.

10:59.704 --> 11:01.756
Let's sue the bastard for
every cent he's got.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.143
And you think that a lawsuit's

11:04.167 --> 11:05.895
only going to make
his life miserable?

11:05.919 --> 11:07.313
What about yours?

11:07.337 --> 11:09.482
You know how long these
things can take?

11:09.506 --> 11:12.193
What with depositions,
continuances, and appeals...

11:12.217 --> 11:13.986
- It's years, Bailey.
- I don't care.

11:14.010 --> 11:15.738
You don't care, but
what about the others?

11:15.762 --> 11:17.897
What about Claudia or Owen?

11:18.348 --> 11:19.617
What about Owen, Bailey?

11:19.641 --> 11:21.119
Because by the time
this thing is over,

11:21.143 --> 11:22.870
he's going to be old
enough to understand.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.622
Yeah, well, at least he'll
see me doing something.

11:24.646 --> 11:25.706
But doing what?

11:25.730 --> 11:27.750
Let's say you lose.
What was it all for?

11:27.774 --> 11:28.709
Well, let's say we win.

11:28.733 --> 11:30.618
Okay, let's say that. You win.

11:30.735 --> 11:32.213
What has it changed?

11:32.237 --> 11:34.006
Exactly what have you won?

11:34.030 --> 11:35.675
You take something like this on,

11:35.699 --> 11:37.292
and it becomes your life.

11:38.034 --> 11:39.419
It is my life.

12:00.473 --> 12:01.774
Oh, no.

12:04.227 --> 12:05.653
- Claudia?
- Aah!

12:06.688 --> 12:07.874
What are you doing?

12:07.898 --> 12:11.085
Um, nothing. Spring cleaning.

12:11.109 --> 12:13.129
Fall! I mean, fall cleaning.
Yeah.

12:13.153 --> 12:14.338
Why?

12:14.362 --> 12:16.215
Because. I mean, I just...

12:16.239 --> 12:17.884
I have too much stuff.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.051
No one needs this much stuff,

12:19.075 --> 12:21.377
so I'm... I'm getting
rid of most of it,

12:21.578 --> 12:23.347
and looking for those few things

12:23.371 --> 12:26.466
I absolutely have to survive.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.969
I got home, I went
into the kitchen,

12:30.629 --> 12:33.441
I got a glass, I
went to the fridge.

12:33.465 --> 12:34.641
- Claudia.
- Aah!

12:35.550 --> 12:36.976
What are you doing?

12:37.052 --> 12:41.397
Um, I'm trying to remember
everything I did today.

12:41.723 --> 12:44.776
It's, um, it's a school project

12:44.809 --> 12:46.945
about... memory.

12:48.021 --> 12:48.998
- Claudia.
- Aah!

12:49.022 --> 12:50.166
What are you doing?

12:50.190 --> 12:51.375
Uh, nothing.

12:51.399 --> 12:52.460
Yeah, well, cut it out.

12:52.484 --> 12:54.128
I gotta get in here, and
you're kinda bugging me.

12:54.152 --> 12:55.328
Bugging you?

12:55.362 --> 12:58.549
Oh, right. Of course I am.
This is really annoying,

12:58.573 --> 13:00.593
but you'll get over that, right?

13:00.617 --> 13:03.294
I mean, you're that kind
of person, aren't you?

13:03.578 --> 13:06.798
You don't, like, hold
a grudge, right?

13:07.999 --> 13:09.259
Right?

13:12.796 --> 13:14.023
What's this?

13:14.047 --> 13:16.933
I figured I'd get some turkey
into you one way or another.

13:18.468 --> 13:19.862
Thanks. Looks good.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.854
Listen, Charlie, here's
what I was thinking.

13:22.597 --> 13:23.866
I own the place, right,

13:23.890 --> 13:26.911
so who says that I gotta
work the holiday shift?

13:26.935 --> 13:28.663
So I'm gonna take tomorrow off,

13:28.687 --> 13:30.039
and what do you say

13:30.063 --> 13:32.416
you guys come over some
time in the afternoon,

13:32.440 --> 13:35.076
we watch the ball game, I'll
put a little food on...

13:35.402 --> 13:36.337
Joe, I told you...

13:36.361 --> 13:38.214
No, no, no. We won't even
call it "Thanksgiving."

13:38.238 --> 13:39.340
It's just going to be you guys

13:39.364 --> 13:40.841
coming over to my
house for a meal.

13:40.865 --> 13:42.584
Nothing fancy. Paper plates.

13:43.118 --> 13:44.095
Joe, I don't think so.

13:44.119 --> 13:45.962
Come on. You got to eat.

13:46.079 --> 13:47.380
We'll eat.

13:47.789 --> 13:49.517
Look, we've had
other invitations.

13:49.541 --> 13:52.468
Ross, Bay's friend Will.

13:52.502 --> 13:53.970
We just don't feel like it.

13:56.548 --> 14:00.027
Charlie, there are going to be
other holidays without them.

14:00.051 --> 14:01.686
Are you going to skip those too?

14:02.012 --> 14:04.105
Look, we just need to get
through this one, okay?

14:04.639 --> 14:06.983
It's easier that
way, for everyone.

14:07.392 --> 14:09.537
I know this guy coming back,
it shakes up everybody,

14:09.561 --> 14:12.488
and it brings up things that
nobody wants to deal with,

14:12.814 --> 14:16.294
but you make a meal, you
sit down as a family.

14:16.318 --> 14:18.953
It's like saying "Life goes on."

14:20.864 --> 14:22.624
We say that every day, Joe,

14:23.074 --> 14:24.626
without the turkey.

14:28.204 --> 14:29.881
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:31.207 --> 14:32.685
I'm sorry. I don't know...

14:32.709 --> 14:34.594
I'm Annie...

14:35.712 --> 14:37.055
Alcott?

14:37.088 --> 14:38.640
Walter Alcott's daughter.

14:39.299 --> 14:40.558
Oh, right.

14:40.592 --> 14:42.695
I brought this pie for you.

14:42.719 --> 14:44.822
We wanted to send
something back then,

14:44.846 --> 14:46.314
but the lawyers said...

14:46.723 --> 14:48.117
I feel so stupid now,

14:48.141 --> 14:49.785
like this is supposed
to mean anything,

14:49.809 --> 14:52.153
but I thought I should
bring something.

14:54.522 --> 14:57.033
I think maybe you
should take this back.

14:57.859 --> 14:59.369
Okay.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.459
I really don't know what to say.

15:07.285 --> 15:08.711
You want me to go?

15:09.204 --> 15:12.340
Maybe. I don't know.

15:13.124 --> 15:14.509
I'm sorry.

15:15.669 --> 15:17.146
I knew you wouldn't
go see my father,

15:17.170 --> 15:18.888
so I had to come see you.

15:19.172 --> 15:21.057
I had to see how you lived.

15:21.341 --> 15:25.196
I had these horrible
pictures in my head

15:25.220 --> 15:27.855
of what it might
be like for you.

15:35.063 --> 15:36.447
It's a nice house.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.659
So you have a baby brother, huh?

15:40.110 --> 15:43.079
Yeah. Owen. He's almost one.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.248
That's good. You
go to high school?

15:45.824 --> 15:46.884
Grant.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.501
Urban. I'm a senior.

15:48.576 --> 15:51.004
Got to figure out colleges now.
You?

15:51.371 --> 15:52.348
Sophomore.

15:52.372 --> 15:53.891
My mom wants me to go
to school in state,

15:53.915 --> 15:55.675
but I kind of want to
get away, you know?

15:56.710 --> 15:59.980
My parents are divorced. I lived with
my mom while my dad was in jail.

16:00.004 --> 16:01.399
Why are you telling me this?

16:01.423 --> 16:02.932
I don't know.

16:03.883 --> 16:05.852
I... I don't know...

16:08.221 --> 16:09.605
I'm sorry.

16:11.683 --> 16:15.579
When my dad was in jail, it was...
almost easier.

16:15.603 --> 16:20.033
You know, it sounds stupid,
but now that he's back, I...

16:22.235 --> 16:23.629
I look at everything
that I have,

16:23.653 --> 16:25.705
and I feel like

16:26.781 --> 16:31.961
I need to be punished or
forgiven or something.

16:34.456 --> 16:36.549
Why? I don't think so.

16:39.419 --> 16:41.471
He's not a bad man.

16:41.921 --> 16:44.140
I want you to know that.

16:44.966 --> 16:46.976
He's just a man.

16:47.969 --> 16:50.855
He's kind of quiet
and gentle, really.

16:51.848 --> 16:53.441
I mean, he sells books.

16:54.768 --> 16:56.069
Okay.

16:57.854 --> 17:00.364
I shouldn't have come.

17:01.483 --> 17:03.534
It's okay. I don't mind.

17:04.194 --> 17:05.953
Do you mean that?

17:06.654 --> 17:09.425
Yeah. I bet we know some
of the same people.

17:09.449 --> 17:11.751
I've got some friends
who go to Urban.

17:24.297 --> 17:25.807
I'm Bailey Salinger.

17:29.886 --> 17:31.354
God, I'm nervous.

17:32.764 --> 17:35.242
I've gone through
this conversation

17:35.266 --> 17:37.193
so many times in my head...

17:38.311 --> 17:39.946
for so many months.

17:40.647 --> 17:42.782
Really? You saw it
as a conversation?

17:43.483 --> 17:45.284
I say something,
you say something.

17:46.361 --> 17:48.506
Well, yes.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.873
Just out of curiosity,
what do I say?

17:51.074 --> 17:54.001
"It's okay? I forgive you"?

17:56.037 --> 17:57.097
How does it end?

17:57.121 --> 17:59.090
Do we shake hands or do we hug?

18:00.208 --> 18:01.634
I know you're angry.

18:04.254 --> 18:06.941
Angry? Angry... God.

18:06.965 --> 18:10.810
No, I mean... I understand.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.728
I don't think you can.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.366
I really don't think

18:15.390 --> 18:17.942
that there's any way that you
could possibly understand.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.778
You don't want to hear anything
I have to say, do you?

18:20.812 --> 18:22.363
No, I sure don't.

18:23.565 --> 18:24.740
Okay, then.

18:25.817 --> 18:27.410
I want to know what
you know about them.

18:27.902 --> 18:29.120
About my parents.

18:30.989 --> 18:34.542
Well, uh, I know their names.

18:34.826 --> 18:37.888
I know your mother was 45

18:37.912 --> 18:40.631
and your father was 48.

18:40.957 --> 18:43.676
Forty-seven. Besides that.

18:44.836 --> 18:46.387
He owned a restaurant.

18:47.171 --> 18:51.402
She was a musician, a violinist.

18:51.426 --> 18:53.394
I mean the important stuff.

18:57.181 --> 18:58.868
She had hair all the
way down her back.

18:58.892 --> 19:00.151
Did you know that?

19:00.602 --> 19:01.944
Beautiful dark hair

19:02.020 --> 19:03.738
my father wouldn't let her cut.

19:03.897 --> 19:07.241
They were married 26
years last January,

19:07.734 --> 19:10.296
and my dad would still
come home in the afternoon

19:10.320 --> 19:12.371
and claim he had a headache,

19:12.697 --> 19:14.133
and he and my mom
would go upstairs,

19:14.157 --> 19:15.750
and we all knew what
they were doing.

19:17.744 --> 19:21.714
They loved each other.
They were in love.

19:26.002 --> 19:28.939
My sister asks me questions
that I can't answer

19:28.963 --> 19:29.982
because I don't know,

19:30.006 --> 19:33.309
like why didn't he wear a watch?

19:33.885 --> 19:36.488
Or what was that song
she used to sing to us

19:36.512 --> 19:37.897
when we were little,

19:38.139 --> 19:39.565
when we had fevers?

19:40.767 --> 19:45.363
And Owen... God, he
won't even know to ask.

19:46.481 --> 19:48.792
They're just going to be
pictures on the piano

19:48.816 --> 19:50.169
and stories that we all tell

19:50.193 --> 19:52.286
that everyone remembers
a little differently.

19:54.864 --> 19:58.626
He's going to walk
soon, my brother.

19:59.702 --> 20:01.263
He's a couple weeks away,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.756
and they're not going to
see it because of you...

20:04.499 --> 20:06.852
because you had a few drinks,

20:06.876 --> 20:08.312
and you got in your car,

20:08.336 --> 20:09.772
and you went through
that intersection,

20:09.796 --> 20:10.856
and you killed them.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.610
What can I do? What
do you want me to do?

20:14.634 --> 20:16.236
I want you to step
on your damn brake

20:16.260 --> 20:18.062
and stop at that red light!

20:18.638 --> 20:20.064
So do I...

20:20.598 --> 20:22.066
but I can't.

20:25.478 --> 20:27.446
I can't take it back...

20:30.942 --> 20:32.660
so what I have to do

20:34.237 --> 20:36.747
is figure out a way
to go forward.

20:36.948 --> 20:38.708
I don't want you
to get past this.

20:38.783 --> 20:40.376
I can't. Why should you?

20:42.245 --> 20:44.171
See, I want to hurt you.

20:45.289 --> 20:46.809
I want to take
something from you,

20:46.833 --> 20:49.103
something that is so
much a part of you

20:49.127 --> 20:51.095
that you don't know who
you are without it,

20:51.254 --> 20:52.940
and I want you to spend
the rest of your life

20:52.964 --> 20:54.724
knowing that's what
you did to us...

20:58.011 --> 21:00.104
And I want to make
sure you never forget.

21:05.977 --> 21:07.413
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

21:07.437 --> 21:09.739
What does that mean,
she stopped by?

21:09.939 --> 21:11.875
Nothing. She just wanted
to see who we are.

21:11.899 --> 21:13.367
She's nice. She goes to Urban.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.494
What did you two do?
Have a little chat?

21:16.195 --> 21:17.172
What's your problem?

21:17.196 --> 21:18.799
- Did you say she can come back?
- No.

21:18.823 --> 21:20.384
- Good, because I don't want her here.
- Bailey...

21:20.408 --> 21:21.885
And I don't want you
talking to her anymore.

21:21.909 --> 21:24.138
Where do you get off telling
me who I can talk to?

21:24.162 --> 21:25.681
You want to know? I'll tell you.

21:25.705 --> 21:28.382
I have the right to say I don't
want his family in this house.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.394
I mean, who do you care
about here, Julia?

21:30.418 --> 21:32.094
Are you listening
to this, Charlie?

21:33.671 --> 21:35.899
I don't care. I don't
want to see her.

21:35.923 --> 21:37.183
Both of you.

21:37.216 --> 21:39.226
Hey, we're the ones who
lost our parents here,

21:39.552 --> 21:40.529
so why the hell am I

21:40.553 --> 21:42.281
in the business of making
her feel better, huh?

21:42.305 --> 21:44.857
You know, they're going to
have Thanksgiving tonight.

21:45.433 --> 21:48.861
Wow. What is happening to you?

21:54.776 --> 21:56.786
Can't you even try
and help here?

21:59.197 --> 22:00.299
What do you want me to do?

22:00.323 --> 22:01.791
That's all you can say?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.303
Doesn't it bother you
what's happening to us?

22:04.327 --> 22:06.295
I mean, don't you care?

22:06.996 --> 22:08.807
How can you not have
a damn thing to say?

22:08.831 --> 22:12.259
Just... Just cut it out, okay?

22:15.671 --> 22:16.972
Go fetch.

22:19.258 --> 22:20.851
Go fetch.

22:23.387 --> 22:24.990
Come on, Thurber.

22:25.014 --> 22:26.816
I've seen this work on TV.

22:27.058 --> 22:28.818
Now, you know what
it smells like.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.945
Now go find it.

22:33.314 --> 22:34.782
Thurber...

22:35.066 --> 22:36.408
please.

22:36.984 --> 22:39.078
Thurber, please!

22:45.117 --> 22:47.545
Come on. Start sniffing.

22:48.246 --> 22:50.631
Come on. Be a real dog for once.

22:54.085 --> 22:55.427
Listen, Thurber,

22:56.128 --> 22:57.564
I'm not saying I don't love you,

22:57.588 --> 23:00.182
but you have been a very big
disappointment recently.

23:00.341 --> 23:02.351
I mean, you're not
much of a pet,

23:02.426 --> 23:03.695
and it would go a long way

23:03.719 --> 23:05.280
to making me feel
better about you

23:05.304 --> 23:07.356
if you'd... if you'd
just help me out.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.568
Just a little?

23:19.402 --> 23:20.536
Bailey.

23:21.696 --> 23:22.913
God.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.791
What are you doing here?

23:26.617 --> 23:29.253
I don't know. I came to see you.

23:31.122 --> 23:32.099
It's a bad time.

23:32.123 --> 23:34.758
We're just... sitting
down to dinner.

23:35.042 --> 23:36.510
To Thanksgiving.

23:37.712 --> 23:39.189
My mom would be okay
if you wanted...

23:39.213 --> 23:42.725
No. No, that's okay. You go...
You go back.

23:44.176 --> 23:45.561
I'll see you.

23:47.388 --> 23:48.731
Are you okay?

23:50.141 --> 23:51.400
Uh,

23:52.852 --> 23:53.954
not really, no.

23:53.978 --> 23:55.455
Kate, honey, we're sitting down.

23:55.479 --> 23:57.583
You guys start without me, okay?

23:57.607 --> 23:59.033
I'll be back in a sec.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.913
You want to sit down?

24:08.075 --> 24:10.586
Tell me, Bailey, did
something terrible happen?

24:10.661 --> 24:12.296
You're scaring me.

24:12.747 --> 24:14.924
No. No, it's nothing like that.
It...

24:16.375 --> 24:19.887
The guy, the drunk driver,
who hit my mom and dad,

24:20.338 --> 24:21.680
he got out of prison.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.893
Oh, wow. That's so fast.

24:26.093 --> 24:27.311
Yeah.

24:28.095 --> 24:30.397
And the thing is I don't
know what's happening to me.

24:31.057 --> 24:33.243
I mean, I was pretty okay with
everything before this...

24:33.267 --> 24:34.202
I know you were.

24:34.226 --> 24:37.029
But now I'm so angry.

24:37.396 --> 24:40.241
I just, I can't do
anything but be angry.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.662
He wants me to forgive
him, and I hate him.

24:44.946 --> 24:47.507
I hate him, and he's
ruining everything.

24:47.531 --> 24:48.707
I just...

24:49.617 --> 24:52.169
I can't even think about
my mom and dad anymore,

24:53.079 --> 24:55.098
and I really need to be able
to think about them again

24:55.122 --> 24:56.799
where it doesn't hurt, you know?

24:58.584 --> 24:59.927
What can I do?

25:04.006 --> 25:05.975
I really needed to
talk to someone,

25:07.009 --> 25:08.477
and I realized

25:08.678 --> 25:10.948
that the person that I
really wanted to talk to

25:10.972 --> 25:12.356
I pushed away.

25:15.017 --> 25:19.113
And... and I don't know
what I was thinking.

25:19.939 --> 25:20.999
I really don't know why

25:21.023 --> 25:22.960
I thought any of those
stupid things mattered,

25:22.984 --> 25:24.493
and I'm sorry.

25:27.154 --> 25:29.373
I don't know why
we split up, Kate.

25:29.782 --> 25:31.625
I really don't. I just...

25:32.702 --> 25:36.255
I just need you. I need you.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.728
You know when you cut
a turkey's head off,

25:50.970 --> 25:53.230
it can still run around
for a long time?

25:53.806 --> 25:55.316
For days, even.

25:57.268 --> 25:58.527
Where'd this come from?

26:00.980 --> 26:02.082
Have you tried it?

26:02.106 --> 26:03.949
The crust is kind of gross.

26:04.817 --> 26:06.410
You want some PB & J?

26:06.569 --> 26:07.953
No. Thanks.

26:10.281 --> 26:12.666
I think it's important
that you eat something.

26:13.117 --> 26:15.085
Hunger can add to irritability.

26:15.536 --> 26:16.596
It can cloud your judgment.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.839
It can make you
overreact to bad news.

26:18.956 --> 26:20.466
Sure you don't want a sandwich?

26:20.791 --> 26:22.551
I'm not hungry, Claud, okay?

26:24.962 --> 26:25.939
How is that?

26:25.963 --> 26:27.306
Dad's was better.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.317
<i>Coverage of today's game</i>

26:29.341 --> 26:31.778
<i>brought to you by Faber's
steel-belted tires,</i>

26:31.802 --> 26:35.481
<i>wishing you and your family
a happy Thanksgiving.</i>

26:37.683 --> 26:40.027
<i>And a timeout has been called.</i>

26:42.271 --> 26:43.864
I'll be back.

26:45.149 --> 26:46.825
Where are you going?

26:51.822 --> 26:53.082
Yes?

26:54.742 --> 26:55.959
Julia.

26:56.744 --> 26:57.804
Dad, this is...

26:57.828 --> 27:01.465
I know, honey. I know who it is.

27:04.460 --> 27:08.347
I know you think that nine
months isn't enough time...

27:10.132 --> 27:11.517
and it's not.

27:12.009 --> 27:13.394
I know that.

27:16.847 --> 27:18.941
Even being in prison that long

27:19.100 --> 27:21.402
didn't feel like
punishment enough.

27:24.105 --> 27:25.489
I...

27:25.731 --> 27:28.325
I think of all the things
I should be doing without

27:29.318 --> 27:31.078
to compensate you...

27:33.447 --> 27:35.582
But there is no
compensation, is there?

27:38.119 --> 27:40.421
No, there isn't.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.801
I know you're sorry,

27:47.503 --> 27:50.055
and I know you wish
it hadn't happened...

27:51.590 --> 27:53.809
and I know you're
suffering, I can see it,

27:55.177 --> 27:57.312
but knowing that
doesn't help me.

28:00.349 --> 28:02.192
It doesn't make
it better, Annie.

28:02.268 --> 28:03.569
It really doesn't.

28:05.104 --> 28:06.488
What can I do?

28:07.940 --> 28:09.158
There's nothing.

28:13.696 --> 28:15.622
But I know what
you want from me.

28:17.032 --> 28:18.709
You want me to forgive you.

28:20.119 --> 28:21.378
Yes.

28:21.996 --> 28:24.006
I don't know that I can do that.

28:26.208 --> 28:29.428
I mean, it wasn't just my
life that you changed,

28:31.255 --> 28:32.774
and I don't know that
I have the right

28:32.798 --> 28:34.433
to speak for anyone else.

28:35.259 --> 28:37.936
And what does that mean,
anyways, "I forgive you"?

28:39.847 --> 28:41.607
Is it going to change anything?

28:42.725 --> 28:45.736
Or does it just mean that I
stop being angry at you.

28:47.521 --> 28:49.323
And I stop hating you?

28:49.982 --> 28:52.868
Because I want that so much.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.372
Just as much as you.

29:10.294 --> 29:11.804
I'll try.

29:13.923 --> 29:15.599
I'm going to try.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.861
The only thing that I can do...

29:29.605 --> 29:31.448
The only thing I can do for you

29:32.942 --> 29:35.369
is tell you that we're
going to be okay.

29:37.196 --> 29:39.341
Because we are, the five of us.

29:39.365 --> 29:41.375
I don't know how I know it.
I just do.

29:42.952 --> 29:44.419
We're going to be okay.

29:46.622 --> 29:49.383
And maybe if you know that,

29:51.126 --> 29:52.678
you'll be okay too.

30:09.395 --> 30:10.747
What's going on in the kitchen?

30:10.771 --> 30:12.582
Since when are you Julia Child?

30:12.606 --> 30:15.075
I kind of thought I'd make
us a late Thanksgiving.

30:15.192 --> 30:17.420
You thought? Really?

30:17.444 --> 30:20.163
What... What happened
to what we all decided?

30:21.574 --> 30:23.500
Charlie, I think
we made a mistake.

30:24.326 --> 30:25.586
Well, I don't.

30:26.787 --> 30:28.014
I think it shows
a little respect

30:28.038 --> 30:29.266
not to sit down and celebrate

30:29.290 --> 30:30.809
like nothing happened this year.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.092
Come on.

30:32.418 --> 30:34.761
It's not like we never sit
around the table and laugh.

30:35.379 --> 30:37.222
It's not like we never smile,

30:37.631 --> 30:39.609
and when we do, we're not
saying we're forgetting

30:39.633 --> 30:40.902
or that everything's okay.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.770
We're just doing
what we have to do.

30:44.638 --> 30:47.107
We're never going to have what
we had last Thanksgiving,

30:47.516 --> 30:48.743
and if we wait 20 years,

30:48.767 --> 30:49.995
it's never going to be the same.

30:50.019 --> 30:52.321
I just want to take a step, Charlie.
Please?

30:57.401 --> 30:59.494
I went to see him yesterday.

31:02.072 --> 31:03.758
For God's sakes, Jule.

31:03.782 --> 31:05.250
I think you should too.

31:05.284 --> 31:06.261
Forget it.

31:06.285 --> 31:08.013
I know something's
wrong with you.

31:08.037 --> 31:10.714
The last few days, it's
like you've disappeared,

31:10.748 --> 31:12.966
and I'm just trying
to figure out why.

31:14.668 --> 31:16.354
- Why?
- Would you just stop?

31:16.378 --> 31:19.190
No. Go see him, Charlie.
It'll help.

31:19.214 --> 31:21.099
- Yeah, him.
- No, us.

31:22.301 --> 31:24.186
I'm telling you it's hard,

31:25.095 --> 31:27.032
but it's not the hardest
thing in the world

31:27.056 --> 31:28.440
to say "I forgive you."

31:29.600 --> 31:30.660
Yes, it is.

31:30.684 --> 31:33.070
No. What you're going
through is a lot harder.

31:34.813 --> 31:36.573
Please, Charlie?

31:38.651 --> 31:40.629
It's like talking
about your nightmares

31:40.653 --> 31:42.088
or looking under your
bed for monsters.

31:42.112 --> 31:43.830
It makes them go away.

31:44.323 --> 31:46.875
Saying "I don't hate
you" makes him go away.

31:47.868 --> 31:49.252
I don't know.

31:50.704 --> 31:51.922
Charlie...

31:53.374 --> 31:54.800
I don't know.

31:58.754 --> 32:00.514
My father had an affair.

32:01.423 --> 32:04.069
What? Recently?

32:04.093 --> 32:05.570
A couple of years ago,

32:05.594 --> 32:07.771
when my parents were
still together.

32:07.805 --> 32:09.064
You're kidding.

32:09.223 --> 32:10.691
Was it with your stepmother?

32:11.266 --> 32:13.370
It was some other
woman in his office.

32:13.394 --> 32:15.028
I don't even know her name.

32:15.854 --> 32:17.990
Mom just walked in on
them one afternoon.

32:18.273 --> 32:19.459
God.

32:19.483 --> 32:21.252
Yeah, I think about that a lot,

32:21.276 --> 32:22.619
how that must feel...

32:22.778 --> 32:23.672
Opening a door

32:23.696 --> 32:25.256
and having your
whole life change

32:25.280 --> 32:26.415
in a single minute.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.584
I know you know.

32:31.829 --> 32:32.847
He met Patricia

32:32.871 --> 32:35.674
about three months after
they were separated.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.884
It almost killed Mom.

32:38.377 --> 32:40.178
She didn't want him
to have a life,

32:40.671 --> 32:42.264
be happy, if she couldn't.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.184
She became this whole
other person...

32:47.428 --> 32:49.855
This ugly, angry person.

32:49.972 --> 32:51.491
She made sure the
divorce took forever

32:51.515 --> 32:52.691
just to spite him.

32:53.183 --> 32:55.444
She refereed to him as
"the son of a bitch."

32:55.686 --> 32:58.238
At my Confirmation, she
keyed Patty's Jag.

32:58.397 --> 33:00.657
Your mom? Really?

33:01.567 --> 33:02.794
Yeah, I don't know
what happened,

33:02.818 --> 33:04.453
but one day she let go of it.

33:04.737 --> 33:05.954
She moved on.

33:06.947 --> 33:09.207
I think she figured out her
life could have become

33:09.366 --> 33:10.844
totally about him,

33:10.868 --> 33:12.669
or it could have
become about her.

33:14.538 --> 33:16.975
Anyway, she came downstairs

33:16.999 --> 33:18.309
and sat down at
the kitchen table

33:18.333 --> 33:19.310
with a cup of coffee,

33:19.334 --> 33:24.139
and she just said,
"Okay, enough."

33:29.678 --> 33:30.979
What about you?

33:32.806 --> 33:34.441
You mean did I hate him?

33:34.475 --> 33:37.736
Yeah. Sure, for a while,

33:38.353 --> 33:40.906
but it took so much energy
to hold on to that.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.451
Everything is so
complicated, Bailey.

33:44.818 --> 33:46.296
My mom and dad,

33:46.320 --> 33:47.704
my dad and me,

33:48.530 --> 33:49.956
even me and you...

33:51.366 --> 33:53.126
so you try to make it simple,

33:53.619 --> 33:54.846
and what it comes
down to is this,

33:54.870 --> 33:57.798
people make mistakes,
terrible mistakes,

33:58.123 --> 33:59.800
all the time, every day,

34:01.168 --> 34:03.178
and you have to learn
to live with it,

34:03.670 --> 34:05.555
because, really, what's
the alternative?

34:08.550 --> 34:10.393
The stuff with my folks,

34:11.512 --> 34:13.188
I know it's not the same.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.235
I know it's not nearly the same.

34:19.770 --> 34:21.321
But still...

34:32.699 --> 34:35.502
You want to give me a hand,
maybe peel some oranges?

34:35.577 --> 34:37.679
Sure. I got to talk to you

34:37.704 --> 34:39.380
about something first, though.

34:41.958 --> 34:43.927
Could you put the
knife down, please?

34:46.129 --> 34:49.181
I did something you're really,
really not going to like.

34:49.424 --> 34:50.641
Yes?

34:52.344 --> 34:54.228
Why don't we just
leave it at that?

34:54.429 --> 34:56.148
Where are those oranges?

34:57.808 --> 34:59.067
Claudia...

34:59.309 --> 35:00.620
You know that bracelet you have

35:00.644 --> 35:01.996
that Dad bought Mom,

35:02.020 --> 35:03.331
the one with all
the little jewels

35:03.355 --> 35:04.916
and the rubies and everything?

35:04.940 --> 35:06.158
Mm-hmm.

35:06.525 --> 35:11.913
Well, I sort of,
kind of, took it.

35:11.947 --> 35:13.007
Oh, no.

35:13.031 --> 35:15.093
I did everything I could to find it.
Honest.

35:15.117 --> 35:16.427
I looked everywhere.

35:16.451 --> 35:19.222
And then I tried to replace
it, but I don't know how,

35:19.246 --> 35:20.598
and I don't have
that much money,

35:20.622 --> 35:22.934
and I'm really sorry, because
I know that you loved it...

35:22.958 --> 35:24.634
How long ago did you
lose it, Claud?

35:25.377 --> 35:26.312
Two days ago.

35:26.336 --> 35:28.356
God, Claudia! Two days! It's
probably gone for good!

35:28.380 --> 35:29.858
You could have said something.

35:29.882 --> 35:31.901
Yeah, right. You would
have just screamed at me.

35:31.925 --> 35:32.944
That's not true.

35:32.968 --> 35:34.320
Yes, it is. You're
always angry at me.

35:34.344 --> 35:35.613
Well, you're always
taking my stuff.

35:35.637 --> 35:37.272
So? What's the big deal?

35:37.431 --> 35:39.399
It's just because I
want to be like you.

35:41.059 --> 35:42.444
I don't know why,

35:42.769 --> 35:44.914
because everything I
do makes you mad,

35:44.938 --> 35:45.874
and you never forgive me.

35:45.898 --> 35:48.074
You never forget about anything.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.753
Like, you're still mad at
me from seven months ago

35:50.777 --> 35:52.996
when I forgot to tell
you that guy called,

35:53.655 --> 35:56.050
that guy, what's his name?

35:56.074 --> 35:57.626
- Steven Pomper.
- See?

36:05.626 --> 36:08.345
I'm sorry for always
being mad at you, okay?

36:12.257 --> 36:15.028
How did you get the combination
to my little mailbox, anyway?

36:15.052 --> 36:18.656
I didn't. You left it in your
jewelry box on your dresser.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.824
No, I didn't.

36:19.848 --> 36:21.816
No, I don't trust you enough.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.661
What is it you took, Claud?

36:23.685 --> 36:24.621
The bracelet

36:24.645 --> 36:26.331
with all the little red
and little purple jewels.

36:26.355 --> 36:27.739
With the silver clasp?

36:28.398 --> 36:29.542
- Yeah.
- That's a piece of junk.

36:29.566 --> 36:30.793
It's from, like, four years ago

36:30.817 --> 36:32.869
when I played a gypsy
in a sixth-grade play.

36:32.945 --> 36:34.454
Piece of junk?

36:36.281 --> 36:39.834
I spent two days in hell
because I lost a prop?

36:41.662 --> 36:43.129
Very funny.

37:02.724 --> 37:06.236
I, uh, I have no story.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.499
I was spending a
Saturday with friends,

37:09.523 --> 37:12.251
and we had dinner,
this long dinner,

37:12.275 --> 37:15.161
and then I had too much wine.

37:16.405 --> 37:17.789
That's it.

37:18.615 --> 37:19.916
That's all I did.

37:21.159 --> 37:24.713
I had too much wine with dinner.

37:26.873 --> 37:30.385
And then about eight o'clock, I
got into my car to drive home.

37:32.754 --> 37:34.931
It was a completely
forgettable day.

37:37.509 --> 37:39.070
You know, people make
mistakes all the time

37:39.094 --> 37:40.937
and nothing happens.

37:42.055 --> 37:45.034
I imagine a million
meaningless separate events

37:45.058 --> 37:47.777
had to come together just so.

37:48.687 --> 37:50.196
Why was there no traffic?

37:50.814 --> 37:53.001
Why was there no cop to
stop me from speeding?

37:53.025 --> 37:54.502
Why did I have to be
at the intersection

37:54.526 --> 37:58.413
of California and Van
Ness at exactly 8:22?

37:59.156 --> 38:01.166
Why did the light
have to be red?

38:02.576 --> 38:04.262
Why did two people
with five children

38:04.286 --> 38:06.338
have to be driving in
the other direction?

38:07.039 --> 38:08.214
Because of me.

38:12.169 --> 38:13.345
What?

38:15.464 --> 38:18.892
They, uh... they had
tickets to a concert

38:20.093 --> 38:21.478
at Symphony Hall.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.900
I guess Mrs. Kelleher
had the day off,

38:27.392 --> 38:28.902
I don't remember.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.488
But I promised to babysit.

38:33.190 --> 38:36.242
But I was with this
girl, this woman,

38:37.486 --> 38:40.455
and, uh, we were
at her apartment,

38:41.406 --> 38:45.585
and, uh, I lost
track of the time.

38:48.371 --> 38:50.715
I don't remember when I
finally got there, but...

38:53.460 --> 38:56.846
He was... He was so mad at me.

38:59.424 --> 39:03.478
The thing is the concert
started at eight o'clock.

39:05.388 --> 39:07.408
They would have been sitting...

39:07.432 --> 39:10.068
They would have been sitting
in their seats at 8:00.

39:13.271 --> 39:14.572
One date.

39:15.148 --> 39:17.409
One stupid date.

39:17.651 --> 39:18.544
I mean, who cared?

39:18.568 --> 39:21.287
I could have... I could
have been home so easily.

39:24.783 --> 39:26.251
You know what he said to me?

39:28.453 --> 39:30.088
"Next time, be here."

39:32.082 --> 39:33.425
Next time.

39:36.962 --> 39:38.555
And Mom, she...

39:40.507 --> 39:42.225
handed Owen to me.

39:44.261 --> 39:45.770
She handed him to me, and...

39:47.806 --> 39:49.357
Then they walked away.

39:53.145 --> 39:54.863
What did I do?

39:56.690 --> 39:58.908
God help me. How do
I get rid of this?

40:00.110 --> 40:01.786
Charlie, listen to me.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.214
No!

40:03.238 --> 40:05.248
It's my fault. I did it.

40:07.033 --> 40:08.136
I need to be forgiven,

40:08.160 --> 40:09.595
only they're not
here to forgive me!

40:09.619 --> 40:11.713
- Stop it.
- It's my fault.

40:11.746 --> 40:13.381
It's my fault!

40:13.790 --> 40:17.635
Charlie... it's my fault.

40:18.753 --> 40:20.180
Listen to me.

40:20.755 --> 40:23.818
Let me do one good
thing in all of this

40:23.842 --> 40:25.518
and tell you the truth.

40:28.889 --> 40:31.149
You're the hero in
this story, son.

40:43.945 --> 40:45.246
Well?

40:46.781 --> 40:47.916
It needs salt.

40:50.493 --> 40:52.045
And a little more pepper...

40:53.914 --> 40:55.256
but on the whole...

40:57.125 --> 40:58.019
First rate.

40:58.043 --> 40:59.020
Really? You think so?

40:59.044 --> 41:00.261
Absolutely.

41:00.337 --> 41:01.564
I doubled the garlic

41:01.588 --> 41:02.815
and added a little
extra chicken broth

41:02.839 --> 41:03.774
so it wouldn't dry out.

41:03.798 --> 41:05.767
Dad's was always a
little on the dry side.

41:06.259 --> 41:07.519
Season away.

41:11.181 --> 41:12.524
What's all this?

41:12.724 --> 41:14.108
What's it look like?

41:15.227 --> 41:16.444
Thanksgiving?

41:16.937 --> 41:18.122
You cooked?

41:18.146 --> 41:19.749
Well, Joe sent a
lot of stuff over,

41:19.773 --> 41:21.375
but I made stuffing,
sweet potatoes,

41:21.399 --> 41:22.617
and apple pie.

41:22.734 --> 41:24.035
And I helped.

41:24.236 --> 41:25.453
And Claud helped.

41:25.862 --> 41:27.089
Didn't we kind of
miss the boat here?

41:27.113 --> 41:28.883
I mean, Thanksgiving was...

41:28.907 --> 41:30.927
Yesterday? Big deal.

41:30.951 --> 41:32.919
I mean, what difference
does it make, right?

41:34.704 --> 41:35.922
Right?

41:38.124 --> 41:39.467
No difference at all.

41:40.585 --> 41:41.719
Turkey's in the oven.

41:43.046 --> 41:44.597
Set the table, Claud, will ya?

41:45.048 --> 41:46.391
Sure.

41:46.508 --> 41:47.725
Hey, man.

41:47.842 --> 41:49.519
Where you been? You
look like hell.

41:51.054 --> 41:52.397
Out.

41:55.850 --> 41:57.110
Just out.

41:57.894 --> 41:59.195
I'm glad.

42:09.406 --> 42:10.999
Julia made Thanksgiving.

42:11.658 --> 42:12.875
I see.

42:14.703 --> 42:16.087
Hey, wait a second.

42:16.788 --> 42:18.840
Don't we always eat Thanksgiving
dinner in the dining room?

42:19.791 --> 42:21.009
Yeah.

42:21.334 --> 42:22.677
Yeah.

42:32.804 --> 42:34.063
There we go.

42:34.764 --> 42:36.117
That looks great, Jule.

42:36.141 --> 42:37.493
That looks very good.

42:37.517 --> 42:39.068
Want some bread?

42:39.477 --> 42:40.955
Want some stuffing, Claud?

42:40.979 --> 42:42.155
A little bit.

42:42.814 --> 42:43.916
Great potatoes.

42:43.940 --> 42:44.917
Is that enough?

42:44.941 --> 42:46.326
Oh, yeah.

42:57.620 --> 42:58.764
It's getting kind of weedy

42:58.788 --> 43:00.131
over by Nana and Papa.

43:00.874 --> 43:02.467
I'll say something to
the groundskeeper.

43:03.001 --> 43:04.802
Here too. God.

43:05.503 --> 43:07.555
I don't think those
are weeds, Bay.

43:13.970 --> 43:16.314
It's lavender. Let's leave it.

43:24.731 --> 43:26.417
Hey, how come some
of the headstones

43:26.441 --> 43:28.034
have stones on them?

43:28.360 --> 43:30.119
Some people like to
leave something behind,

43:30.612 --> 43:32.372
kind of as a way of
showing they were here.

44:02.936 --> 44:04.153
Pez?

44:04.270 --> 44:05.998
Ha ha! Sure.

44:06.022 --> 44:07.824
- Why not?
- That's a good idea.

44:10.068 --> 44:11.536
Hey, you know what, Claud?

44:14.322 --> 44:15.216
You're it.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.175
What?

44:16.199 --> 44:18.835
Oh, no fair. No fair!
