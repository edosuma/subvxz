01:47.708 --> 01:51.570
<i>One day you'll be back</i>

01:52.291 --> 01:56.904
<i>When you're done dreaming</i>

01:57.833 --> 02:00.654
<i>At last</i>

02:02.833 --> 02:06.320
<i>Now this road has passed</i>

02:07.208 --> 02:09.983
<i>And you're done wandering...</i>

02:10.083 --> 02:12.025
Evelyn!

02:12.125 --> 02:15.529
<i>Will you come back?</i>

02:17.041 --> 02:22.612
<i>Oh, how people change</i>

02:24.291 --> 02:28.066
<i>But you... were never like</i>

02:28.166 --> 02:29.900
<i>The others</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:32.320
<i>Babe</i>

02:34.291 --> 02:39.320
<i>Now that's the same</i>

02:58.083 --> 03:03.362
<i>But, oh how people change</i>

03:06.875 --> 03:09.525
<i>You were never like</i>

03:09.625 --> 03:13.987
<i>The others, babe</i>

03:15.833 --> 03:20.112
<i>Now that's the same</i>

03:26.000 --> 03:29.612
<i>One day you'll be back</i>

03:30.583 --> 03:33.904
<i>You keep dreaming</i>

03:34.333 --> 03:38.987
<i>But you will come home</i>

04:11.333 --> 04:13.320
You're late.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.737
Did I say you could sit?

04:45.833 --> 04:48.487
You can start by cleaning the study.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.570
And don't take all day this time.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.570
While you're there,
you can take the bin out.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.237
Hello, Lorna.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.820
Where are you going?

08:27.916 --> 08:30.066
I thought I'd finished for the day.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.482
You finish when I say.

08:32.582 --> 08:36.482
- But there is nothing left to do.
- Oh, there's plenty left to do.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.820
You can start by rubbing my feet.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.487
May I go to the toilet?

09:34.083 --> 09:35.362
No.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.608
But I...

09:38.708 --> 09:41.775
I think it's better
that you stay by my feet

09:41.875 --> 09:44.737
and continue doing
what I asked you to do.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.362
Come in.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.691
I finished sweeping the porch.

12:15.791 --> 12:18.612
- Can I go now?
- Did you wash my things?

12:19.875 --> 12:22.695
- What things?
- You keep forgetting.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.691
I left a whole pile for you.

12:25.791 --> 12:29.816
Okay, but can you show me
how to use the machine?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.404
You won't be using the machine.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.320
- It's all done.
- You rinsed the soap off?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.279
Let's see if you've done
your job properly.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.820
What's this doing here?

14:13.791 --> 14:15.691
This was on the pile.

14:15.791 --> 14:17.858
This was on the pile for you to wash.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.900
Sorry, I..

14:20.000 --> 14:23.525
- I didn't see it.
- How could you not see it?

14:23.625 --> 14:26.566
I.. I can wash it now,
it's not a problem.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.400
No, you can't wash it now
and it is a problem,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.525
because I have other plans for you now.

14:31.625 --> 14:34.275
It's just a few minutes,
that's all it takes.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.316
I've waited enough already.

14:36.416 --> 14:39.612
You haven't washed anything properly
and you forgot this.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.695
- Sorry.
- You will be.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.650
- What are you going to do?
- A little punishment.

14:46.750 --> 14:50.362
- But I... I can do it now.
- It's too late.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.650
Lie down.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.695
Open your mouth.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.862
Thank you, so much.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.816
Not too cold?

16:13.916 --> 16:15.862
The colder the better.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.900
By highlighting
the geographical proximity

18:43.000 --> 18:45.775
of Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa
and Gryllotalpa vineae,

18:45.875 --> 18:49.483
these recordings should demonstrate
how fundamental sound is

18:49.583 --> 18:51.441
as a classifying factor.

18:51.541 --> 18:56.400
Species identification will partly
rely upon the duration of one syllable

18:56.500 --> 18:58.525
usually in milliseconds.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.733
The carrier wave expressed in kilohertz

19:01.833 --> 19:04.400
is another factor in identification.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.941
Since these species are so visually
indistinguishable from each other,

19:09.041 --> 19:13.233
the sound they produce
should differentiate the two.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.654
Dr Schuller, if we could hear
the Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa please.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.695
And now if we hear
Gryllotalpa vineae, please?

20:55.666 --> 20:57.529
Did I say you could stop?

21:13.166 --> 21:15.400
'Cynthia.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.195
'Cynthia.

21:17.958 --> 21:21.483
'This is all I ever dreamed about,

21:21.583 --> 21:23.487
'to be owned by you.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.362
'To be used by you.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.987
'I can't tell you how happy I am.

21:30.916 --> 21:34.029
'I never thought I could find
someone like you.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.237
'I never thought it would be possible.

21:39.750 --> 21:42.570
'I won't let you down, Cynthia.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.733
'Never.

21:44.833 --> 21:46.737
'I won't let you down.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.900
'As long as I'm yours,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.029
'I remain alive.

21:53.541 --> 21:55.695
'I love you, Cynthia.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.237
'I love you.'

25:09.958 --> 25:11.445
You're late.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.612
Did I say you could sit?

25:41.833 --> 25:43.987
You can start by cleaning the study.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.987
And don't take all day this time.

27:07.875 --> 27:09.862
So you've finished already?

27:10.833 --> 27:14.487
Good for you. I have something else
for you to do now.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.445
Come here.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.608
What are you doing?

28:10.708 --> 28:12.737
I told you to clean my boots.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.612
Do that again and you'll be punished.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.862
You don't listen, do you?

29:37.625 --> 29:39.441
You just don't listen!

29:39.541 --> 29:43.775
Now you'll see what happens
when you don't listen.

29:43.875 --> 29:46.320
When you're being bad and lazy.

30:25.416 --> 30:28.150
...what distinguishes
Thaumetopoea pityocampa

30:28.250 --> 30:30.275
from other Tussock moths

30:30.375 --> 30:32.445
is the communal nature of their larvae.

30:33.041 --> 30:37.275
The sun gives them enough energy
for their nocturnal foraging.

30:37.375 --> 30:38.487
You like it?

30:39.333 --> 30:40.983
- That's really nice.
- Yes?

30:41.083 --> 30:42.195
Yes.

31:41.708 --> 31:42.987
Tell me something.

31:52.958 --> 31:55.279
There's so many things to tell you.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.487
Far too many things.

32:05.916 --> 32:08.654
But I can start with
how much I love you...

32:11.125 --> 32:14.404
and how happy I am
that you're here with me.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.904
- How happy I am...
- Talk about the other things.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.320
I'm not happy.

32:37.541 --> 32:39.400
I'm not happy with you at all.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.441
- Really?
- Really.

32:41.541 --> 32:43.279
What have I done?

32:46.041 --> 32:48.237
It's what you haven't done.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.108
You haven't been a good maid.

32:54.208 --> 32:57.612
And I have to do
everything I want with you.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.987
You're mine now.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.150
Keep talking.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.070
Say something else.

33:10.083 --> 33:12.779
You haven't washed my panties recently.

33:14.833 --> 33:16.945
Nor have you polished my boots.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.858
If you want to be a good maid,

33:22.958 --> 33:25.654
you have to do these things a lot more.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.237
Otherwise, you'll be punished.

33:32.250 --> 33:34.316
Keep talking.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.612
I don't know what to say.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.195
Just go back to the beginning, then.

33:48.250 --> 33:49.941
I'm not happy.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.904
I'm not happy with you at all.

33:58.375 --> 33:59.654
Improvise!

34:03.541 --> 34:05.612
When you work for me, it's for life.

34:08.083 --> 34:10.483
You have to do...

34:10.583 --> 34:13.154
whatever I want, whenever I want.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.440
Because if you don't,

34:17.541 --> 34:20.275
I just... might tie you up

34:20.375 --> 34:22.987
and use you as my chair
for the afternoon.

34:24.958 --> 34:28.362
I can read about cave crickets...

34:30.458 --> 34:33.815
whilst you're helpless underneath me

34:33.916 --> 34:38.029
and I put my weight
upon your face and...

34:39.000 --> 34:42.983
you just have to lie there and wait

34:43.083 --> 34:46.570
until I'm finished reading
my book and...

35:27.541 --> 35:31.779
Try to have more conviction
in your voice next time.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.029
More conviction.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.404
Okay.

37:18.958 --> 37:24.066
...although what distinguishes the skippers
from hair streaks, coppers and blues

37:24.166 --> 37:27.191
is the way the clubs and antennae
gradually thicken,

37:27.291 --> 37:28.983
often ending in hooked points.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.108
Also, their larvae...

37:30.208 --> 37:32.141
This is elementary level.

37:32.241 --> 37:35.775
...pupating in silk shelters
at the base of legumes or herbs.

37:35.875 --> 37:39.316
However, in order to survive,
the larvae need plentiful light,

37:39.416 --> 37:42.316
which often occurs inadvertently
when livestock are grazing.

37:42.416 --> 37:44.775
The most explicit example for this

37:44.875 --> 37:47.316
is the larvae
of the Silver-spotted Skipper,

37:47.416 --> 37:49.650
which feed on sheep's fescue grass,

37:49.750 --> 37:53.941
which in turn is never allowed
to grow too plentifully by grazing cows.

37:54.041 --> 37:54.858
Thank you.

37:54.958 --> 37:58.779
Thank you, Dr Viridana.
Would anyone like to ask a question?

38:00.833 --> 38:04.733
I often have trouble differentiating
between the Small and Large Skipper.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.816
Is there any way to tell them apart?

38:06.916 --> 38:09.233
Easy. One is large, one is small.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.691
A lot of people have that trouble, since
they are both the same size and colour.

38:12.791 --> 38:17.483
But the Small Skipper often holds its
wings at a 45-degree angle when resting.

38:17.583 --> 38:20.025
Its orange colouring
is more uniform, too,

38:20.125 --> 38:23.987
while the Large Skipper has mottled
orange patterns on its underside.

38:24.958 --> 38:26.195
Any other questions?

38:28.916 --> 38:31.654
Could you talk about the venation
of the Grizzled Skipper?

38:33.291 --> 38:35.566
How do you mean?

38:35.666 --> 38:39.191
In terms of longitudinal and cross veins

38:39.291 --> 38:44.441
and how... how they vary in relation
to other species within the family.

38:44.541 --> 38:47.608
Well, the Grizzled Skipper is
so visually distinctive amongst the family

38:47.708 --> 38:50.483
that there's no need to go
into such detail on the wings.

38:50.583 --> 38:53.358
It's the only skipper in the region
to have black markings

38:53.458 --> 38:56.487
- and is by far the easiest to identify.
- I know.

38:57.208 --> 39:02.191
I was just wondering how one goes
about classifying other Pyrgus species

39:02.291 --> 39:04.108
in other regions.

39:04.208 --> 39:08.279
I'm afraid it's something I can't answer.
This talk only concerns this region.

39:09.333 --> 39:12.108
Any other questions? No?

39:12.208 --> 39:14.066
Okay, well, once again,

39:14.166 --> 39:16.233
thank you very much, Dr Viridana.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.150
For the next talk, we'll have...

39:18.250 --> 39:20.358
- What's that look?
- Nothing.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.945
...parasitic Hymenoptera.

40:00.291 --> 40:02.233
I feel so stupid, Cynthia.

40:02.333 --> 40:07.066
- Stupid about what?
- That Grizzled Skipper nonsense.

40:07.166 --> 40:11.070
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- You don't think I'm stupid, do you?

40:11.625 --> 40:14.279
Of course not. It's okay.

40:22.458 --> 40:24.066
What?

40:24.166 --> 40:26.070
Can you let me go now?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.195
No.

44:16.625 --> 44:19.400
So, you would like your lover
to sleep on top of you?

44:19.500 --> 44:20.820
Yes.

44:21.458 --> 44:24.358
I make two types of bed
for what you want.

44:24.458 --> 44:28.275
One where the compartment underneath
slides out and then back in,

44:28.375 --> 44:30.775
or one where the bed mattress lifts up

44:30.875 --> 44:33.650
and then can be pulled down
and locked once you're inside.

44:33.750 --> 44:35.733
Once you're inside, it's the same.

44:35.833 --> 44:39.191
It's just the sensation of being put in
and set free that is different.

44:39.291 --> 44:41.150
Which one would you recommend?

44:41.250 --> 44:45.441
The bed lifting up is often more favoured
than the drawer-style compartment.

44:45.541 --> 44:47.650
Sometimes the drawers can get stuck.

44:47.750 --> 44:50.816
Thankfully, that usually happens
when they're out, rather than in,

44:50.916 --> 44:54.191
but it's a critical moment when they're
about to be locked up for the night

44:54.291 --> 44:56.775
and then realise that they can't be.

44:56.875 --> 45:00.275
Well, the bed lifting up
seems fine by me.

45:00.375 --> 45:03.233
It's just a simple spring
that lifts the bed up.

45:03.333 --> 45:07.733
Customers find the slamming effect of the
bed closing down on them very dramatic.

45:07.833 --> 45:09.945
That bed is very popular.

45:10.625 --> 45:14.316
I think I made one for someone
in the neighbourhood a few months ago.

45:14.416 --> 45:16.150
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

45:16.250 --> 45:20.275
- Who was that?
- I can't remember her name.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.733
Let me think...

45:22.833 --> 45:26.233
It's the house with the wisteria porch
and yellow colonnade,

45:26.333 --> 45:28.775
a few minutes down the lane.

45:28.875 --> 45:31.150
- Yellow colonnade?
- That's got to be Ambrosia.

45:31.250 --> 45:33.150
Is that her house?

45:33.250 --> 45:35.483
She might have painted
the colonnade another colour,

45:35.583 --> 45:37.775
but that's got to be Ambrosia.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.900
I'm surprised you could make a bed
big enough for her to be locked in.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.445
Okay, then it's the same customer
I'm thinking of.

45:44.250 --> 45:46.775
But yes, that design
is a lot more popular

45:46.875 --> 45:48.983
and because of the spring,
it's easy to lift up.

45:49.083 --> 45:52.066
With both designs,
there's a lock at each end of the bed,

45:52.166 --> 45:54.025
but even without those,

45:54.125 --> 45:56.025
the weight of one's lover
sleeping on top

45:56.125 --> 45:58.195
means that it's almost
impossible to escape.

45:59.125 --> 46:01.275
- And...
- I can also add metal hooks to the inside

46:01.375 --> 46:04.279
if you like having your hands and feet
tied to something.

46:05.083 --> 46:07.025
That sounds perfect.

46:07.125 --> 46:10.358
And how long does it take
once we've placed an order?

46:10.458 --> 46:13.654
Oh, usually around eight weeks.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.566
Eight weeks!

46:17.666 --> 46:24.441
I'm afraid there's a lot of demand
and it takes time to make each bed.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.025
Eight weeks?

46:26.125 --> 46:28.941
Is there any way
you can offer a faster service?

46:29.041 --> 46:31.608
It's just that Evelyn's birthday
is coming up

46:31.708 --> 46:33.779
and I was planning this as a present.

46:34.500 --> 46:38.733
- Oh, it depends when your birthday is.
- Two weeks.

46:38.833 --> 46:41.112
It will be my birthday in two weeks.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.612
Two weeks?

46:45.791 --> 46:48.275
It's impossible. I'm sorry.

46:48.375 --> 46:51.816
We can offer you extra, if it helps.

46:51.916 --> 46:54.733
We have a mount
of extremely rare Satyrids.

46:54.833 --> 46:57.400
You wouldn't find those
even in the museums.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.858
They're worth far more
than Nymphalids or Burnets.

46:59.958 --> 47:02.900
Evelyn's right.
It's a highly collectable mount.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.900
I'm sorry, but I have too much pressure
from other customers.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.404
And I cannot do it any sooner
than eight weeks. I'm so sorry.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.195
Well, we'd have to discuss it,
anyway, before we order.

47:18.541 --> 47:22.066
It's okay.
There will be another birthday.

47:22.166 --> 47:25.529
If you like, we could look for something
that is not so much in demand.

47:26.291 --> 47:28.070
The bed would have been perfect.

47:31.375 --> 47:34.570
Would a human toilet
be a suitable compromise?

47:36.833 --> 47:37.941
Really?

47:38.041 --> 47:40.650
- Well...
- I really have to go now.

47:40.750 --> 47:43.816
But wait.
Don't you want to hear about this?

47:43.916 --> 47:46.445
Oh, I have to go.
I told you I had to leave.

47:47.375 --> 47:50.108
I'm sorry for being so abrupt.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

47:50.208 --> 47:51.737
It was a pleasure for me.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.816
I'll be back in an hour,
will I meet you here?

47:54.916 --> 47:56.150
I'll be here.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.650
Don't make any orders
without consulting with me.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.358
I won't, don't worry. I'll let you know.

48:01.458 --> 48:02.987
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

48:06.041 --> 48:08.816
So... there are two types available.

48:08.916 --> 48:11.654
The basic model allows you
to experience...

52:38.208 --> 52:40.279
What is that look?

53:12.250 --> 53:13.650
There.

53:13.750 --> 53:16.275
Just a little longer, please.
I'm in such agony.

53:16.375 --> 53:18.483
Rubbing it's not going to help.

53:18.583 --> 53:21.112
You need an ice pack
and some painkillers.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.066
Do you want me to call a doctor?

53:28.166 --> 53:30.112
No, it's okay.

53:35.875 --> 53:39.487
My back does this every few years.
It'll get better.

53:41.916 --> 53:42.945
Here.

53:44.291 --> 53:45.612
Thank you.

53:59.583 --> 54:00.654
Thanks.

54:15.958 --> 54:18.029
- Tell me?
- Okay.

54:19.541 --> 54:21.566
You don't sound enthusiastic.

54:21.666 --> 54:23.525
It says to be cold.

54:23.625 --> 54:25.775
Yes, but not now.

54:25.875 --> 54:29.525
And one thing I forgot to write -
don't talk about it.

54:29.625 --> 54:32.525
- Just surprise me.
- I know, I know.

54:32.625 --> 54:35.858
Well, you were a bit slow
to surprise me last time.

54:35.958 --> 54:38.529
Well, it's not a surprise
if you're expecting it, is it?

54:39.625 --> 54:43.529
I know, but... what I mean by surprise
is within 24 hours.

54:45.250 --> 54:48.400
But not in the first hour,
because that wouldn't be a surprise.

54:48.500 --> 54:49.566
Okay, okay.

54:49.666 --> 54:51.737
And not in the last hour, either.

54:52.708 --> 54:54.737
I'm just all frustrated by then.

54:57.875 --> 54:59.987
So within 22 hours, then?

55:04.333 --> 55:05.358
Yes.

55:05.458 --> 55:07.070
Anything else?

55:08.375 --> 55:09.445
No.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.404
Come in.

56:42.916 --> 56:44.695
It's all done.

56:45.833 --> 56:47.945
You rinsed the soap off?

56:51.166 --> 56:53.654
Let's see if you've done
your job properly.

57:11.375 --> 57:13.195
What's this doing here?

57:23.208 --> 57:26.525
How long do I have to stay in here for?

57:26.625 --> 57:28.612
For as long as I want.

58:57.041 --> 58:59.195
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

59:07.000 --> 59:08.691
Can you breathe in there?

59:08.791 --> 59:10.904
Yes!

59:36.000 --> 59:38.237
Pinastri.

59:41.666 --> 59:43.070
Pinastri.

59:50.625 --> 59:52.529
Pinastri!

01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:19.816
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.862
- Just a mosquito bite.
- Aw.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.737
I told you,
it's more fun to sleep with me.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:34.941
Maybe you can put me back in there,
but just don't tie me.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:37.154
Come to bed.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:13.362
'This is all I ever dreamed about.

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:19.779
'This is all I ever dreamed about.'

01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:07.900
Pinastri.

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:15.570
Lie down.

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:20.987
Open your mouth.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:42.441
Try turning the tap on.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:06.445
- Why did you write about mole crickets?
- Why not?

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:10.650
Such ugly things.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:12.983
No wonder they hide under the ground.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:16.070
Ugly maybe, but beautifully eloquent.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.566
Aargh!

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.906
Are you okay?

01:04:24.596 --> 01:04:26.571
Okay. Just about.

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:34.695
It would just be nice
if you volunteered to rub my back.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.316
Sorry.

01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:39.400
I didn't know you needed anything.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.691
Well, you can see that I'm in pain.

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:46.445
Well, it's not exactly inspiring
to see you dressed like that.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.191
Good thing you're not a doctor, then.

01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:54.445
That's really some look you have there!

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.570
Even the tramps are less shabby.

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:03.566
I'm starting to wonder why I bothered
buying you a whole wardrobe.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:07.775
I need an instruction manual to get
into half of the things you buy me.

01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:11.675
I would just like to feel comfortable,
thank you very much.

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:23.362
This is giving me a headache.

01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:32.862
You're not going to turn it off?

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:36.445
Did you ask me to?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.445
How long do I have to stay in here for?

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.733
For as long as I want.

01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:19.237
Morning, Lorna.

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:39.900
Do you want to go with me
to the library?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.945
What time is it?

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:47.945
It's around two.

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:55.733
I thought we could also
have an ice cream after.

01:07:56.564 --> 01:07:58.362
Another time.

01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:02.316
The Institute will close for winter
any day soon.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:03.862
I know.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:09.112
So you're not coming, then?

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:14.279
I need to sleep if you're going
to put me in the trunk tonight.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.441
That's news to me.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.944
It would be nice if you did it
without having to be asked.

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.983
There used to be a time when my body
would just repair itself overnight.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:04.900
It's all downhill from now.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.650
Don't be such a pessimist!
You have many, many years left in you.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:12.945
Oh, that reminds me.
On the subject of getting old.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:18.233
- I spoke to Lorna the other day.
- I don't know why you bother.

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:21.441
What's that miserable sow
have to say, anyway?

01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:25.316
She wanted to alert us
to some root problems with the birch.

01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:28.108
She claims they might be
unsettling her foundations.

01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:31.150
Let her claim away. What a nonsense.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:35.025
That tree rests too far from the house
to have any effect.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:36.900
Ignore her.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.945
She's nothing
but a bloated bag of trapped wind.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:46.195
She also claims she spotted you polishing
Dr Schuller's boots in her backyard.

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:50.441
Tell me that's just another sly rumour.

01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:53.525
Don't be ridiculous.
You know what Lorna's like.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:57.775
Are you really going to get taken in
by such idle gossip?

01:10:57.875 --> 01:11:00.400
No, but this was rather precise.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.691
It would hurt me more
if you denied such an accusation.

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:07.775
So, I'm condemned
for denying a false accusation?

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:10.733
- That's a good move!
- Just tell me the truth.

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.941
I'm telling you the truth.

01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:16.487
That Lorna makes it her business
to spread dirty lies.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.362
You polished her boots, didn't you?

01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:23.820
Tell me.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.404
Don't lie to me, Evelyn.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.029
Tell me what you did.

01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:34.650
I'm sorry.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.612
I'm really sorry.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:43.025
So what else did you two get up to?

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:45.279
- Nothing.
- Really?

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:49.233
Nothing. I swear! Nothing!

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:51.445
I just polished her boots.

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:55.112
I find that hard to believe.

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.987
Did she punish you?

01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:01.650
- Did she punish you?
- No!

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.316
So you just polished her boots
out of pure good will?

01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:06.691
Okay, she...

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:09.150
She told me off a bit.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.570
That's all. Nothing more.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.441
How did she tell you off?

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:18.483
- Let's not...
- How did she tell you off?

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:21.900
I don't know. Just some harsh words.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.733
Some threats.
That's all. Then I went home.

01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:28.400
- I bet you did.
- I didn't do anything.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.487
We didn't kiss, we didn't touch.
Nothing, I swear.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.695
Believe me, I didn't do anything.

01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:39.525
That's your idea of not doing anything?

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.983
For what it's worth,
you might as well have gone all the way.

01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:45.237
The damage has been done.

01:12:46.841 --> 01:12:50.279
- What damage?
- You betrayed me!

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:54.650
Do you call that betrayal?

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.941
Why would you lie about something
if you didn't regard it as betrayal?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:02.858
Because you'd automatically think
something else happened when it didn't.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:05.983
- Where are you going?
- Somewhere.

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:07.612
Anywhere.

01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:11.941
- Anywhere away from you.
- Please, Cynthia.

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:16.525
Please. I'm sorry.
That was just a bad day.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.025
I was feeling weak. I was frustrated.

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:21.650
I'm sorry.
I wasn't getting what I needed here.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:26.237
So, had I ordered a human toilet,
none of this would've happened then?

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:31.779
I'm sorry. I'm weak and I'm sorry.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.775
Cynthia! Please!

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:37.112
Please, Cynthia!

01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:39.029
I love you. Please.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:45.316
The tunnelling larvae of Xestobium
rufovillosum are a severe pest

01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:47.775
in both buildings
and in the timber trade.

01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:50.441
Their trail of devastation
isn't as patterned

01:13:50.541 --> 01:13:52.983
as species from the Scolytidae family.

01:13:53.083 --> 01:13:55.775
Their galleries and tunnels
deep within the wood

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:58.195
are distinctive to each species.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:03.029
Xestobium rufovillosum favours oak,
whether living or felled.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.900
'Although seldom seen,
its presence is often felt

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.400
'by the sinister tapping sound it makes

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.025
'to attract a mate during the spring.'

01:14:18.651 --> 01:14:20.220
Wait! Wait!

01:14:37.333 --> 01:14:39.441
Now, my love.

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.987
A small birthday treat for you.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.029
All I can say is
I hope you like it as much as I do.

01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:56.108
Is this a joke?

01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:59.941
No, no.
The ingredients for your birthday cake.

01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:02.029
Which you are going to make.

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:04.945
Here's the recipe.

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:07.900
And while you're doing that,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.987
I'll go change into something nicer.

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:14.654
- I don't know if I can...
- Oh, you have to.

01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:17.483
Read the recipe

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.570
and make the cake.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.820
I want you ready by nine.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:54.695
Now, put it here.

01:16:04.916 --> 01:16:07.154
Where's my fork?

01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:31.025
- What about...?
- Don't come so close.

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.612
Your breath is like a hyena.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.987
Now, lie down.

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:40.570
Here.

01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:05.441
- This is not funny.
- Did I say you could speak?

01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:06.779
Pinastri.

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.529
Pinastri.

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:12.070
Pinastri, Pinastri.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:17.695
Oh, if we could all just say Pinastri
to end our torments.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.695
<i>Two by two</i>

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:52.487
<i>Watching them over</i>

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:58.154
<i>Follow as they're told</i>

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:01.862
<i>Moving through</i>

01:18:02.666 --> 01:18:05.650
<i>Watch them grow older</i>

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:10.529
<i>Follow when they go</i>

01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:14.362
<i>Ah...</i>

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:17.779
<i>Ah...</i>

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.779
<i>Two by two</i>

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:31.733
<i>Love with no answer</i>

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:36.820
<i>Hiding the untold</i>

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:41.029
<i>Moving through</i>

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.691
<i>Loving the other</i>

01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:49.570
<i>Hide the overgrown</i>

01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:53.779

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:56.945
<i>Ah</i>

'I'm sorry. I didn't see it.'

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:43.233
'How could you not see it?
I left it there on the pile.

01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:46.150
'Answer me. How could you not see it?'

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.358
'But I can wash it now.
It's not a problem.'

01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:06.941
'No, you can't wash it now
and it is a problem,

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:09.691
'because I have other plans
for you now.'

01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:12.445
- 'Sorry.'
- 'You will be.'

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:32.487
Pinastri.

01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:41.362
Pinastri.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.029
Pinastri.

01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:01.112
'Pinastri.'

01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:50.237
Cynthia.

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:55.570
Can you sit on me?

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.904
Please?

01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:50.066
'The anatomy of Gryllotalpidae

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:53.445
'is highly modified
for a subterranean existence.

01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:58.233
'The squat and broad velvety haired body

'occasionally to depths of one metre.'

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:12.066
The spade-like forelimbs
are enlarged and very powerful,

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:14.445
ideally suited for digging.

01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:17.358
'With the advent of winter,

01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:21.733
'all Gryllotalpidae retreat
into their burrows.'

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.275
There they will remain in hibernation,

01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:27.066
still and dormant,

01:30:27.166 --> 01:30:30.025
until the spring sun
warms the soil enough

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.445
to stir them from their slumber.

01:34:01.708 --> 01:34:03.695
It's all done.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:08.029
You rinsed the soap off?

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:13.779
Let's see if you've done
your job properly.

01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:40.862
What's th...?

01:34:49.416 --> 01:34:51.737
What's this doing here?

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.612
I left it on the pile.

01:34:59.791 --> 01:35:02.525
I left it on the pile for you to wash.

01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:04.195
Sorry... I...

01:35:05.416 --> 01:35:07.570
I didn't see it.

01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:12.445
How could you not see it?

01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:17.566
I left it there

01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:19.066
on the pile.

01:35:19.166 --> 01:35:21.237
But I can wash it now.

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:24.070
It's not a problem.

01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:28.070
No, you can't wash it now.

01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:31.612
And it is a problem.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.570
I can do this. Okay...

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.029
I'm sorry.

01:35:51.125 --> 01:35:53.650
Please don't be mad at me.

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:55.779
Please don't be mad at me.

01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:58.891
It's okay.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:07.404
I can change, if this is what
it does to you. I can change.

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:11.154
All this is just a luxury.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.858
The important thing is you.

01:36:14.958 --> 01:36:19.275
No, but maybe you'll end up
resenting me. We can't win.

01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.441
How can I resent you?

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:23.445
I love you.

01:36:24.541 --> 01:36:26.154
I love you.

01:36:27.125 --> 01:36:30.195
I know have a different way
of showing it.

01:36:30.875 --> 01:36:32.862
But I love you.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.279
You don't believe me, do you?

01:36:52.416 --> 01:36:55.029
What do you want me to do to prove it?

01:36:57.875 --> 01:37:02.941
Just tell me.
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:06.195
Oh, please, believe that I love you.

01:38:58.541 --> 01:39:02.233
- 'Are you okay?'
- 'Of course.'

01:39:02.333 --> 01:39:05.275
- 'Are you sure?'
- 'I'm sure.

01:39:05.375 --> 01:39:07.445
'I'm sure, don't worry.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.529
'Everything's fine.

'Everything's more than fine.'

01:39:15.166 --> 01:39:17.737
- 'Really?'
- 'Really.
