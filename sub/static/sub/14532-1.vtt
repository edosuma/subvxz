WEBVTT

00:04.296 --> 00:05.843
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.634
I saw them talking
at Angela's apartment.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.223
She's filed a formal
harassment complaint, Greg.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.263
You're suspended,
effective immediately.

00:13.430 --> 00:17.731
- What are you doing here?
- You sold me out

00:17.893 --> 00:19.861
because you know
your boyfriend's dirty.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.237
You know he's Ghost, right?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.524
He's going down, Angela.
You're going down with him.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.239
I'm gonna leave town with the kids.
I want you to come with us.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.369
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

00:28.529 --> 00:31.009
Have you been using me this whole time
to get revenge on Ghost?

00:31.034 --> 00:32.581
You don't deserve to be my son.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.914
This is my fault, 'Keisha.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.920
This the gun you used to kill
your own son?

00:37.079 --> 00:40.504
He wasn't my son no more.
He was your son.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.263
Why would somebody
break in here to start a fire?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.523
Nobody broke in here.
Somebody broke out.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.026
It's you and me, Tommy,
just like it's always been.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.607
What else I got to do
to prove my loyalty to you?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.613
Tommy, Ghost sent me away.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.649
I didn't want to leave you.
He made me go.

01:05.816 --> 01:09.571
My brother's gone, so I'ma do
your lyin' ass a favor and take over.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.659
I'ma distribute for Lobos
from now on.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.620
There is no more business.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.706
Keeping them alive
was too risky.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.296
There ain't nobody left.

01:19.454 --> 01:23.084
Lobos, his whole New York
syndicate is dead or missing.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.799
- I heard.
- I can't be with Ghost.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.713
Angela, Ghost is dead,

01:27.879 --> 01:30.132
but James St. Patrick is real.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.894
Tomas, I need you to do
something for me.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.855

you know?

04:08.874 --> 04:11.343
There's a whole list at this club
and the two other ones.

I need to grab some food for her.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.859
- You're not coming with me, babe.
- Why not?

05:16.107 --> 05:18.860
You don't fuckin' trust me,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.325
even though everything I said
about Ghost was true.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.866
This ain't about trust.
I ain't taking you, Holly.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.376
It's called plausible deniability.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.495
You can't tell nobody what you didn't see,
in case you get picked up again.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.502
Fuck you, Tommy.
You stay out of trouble,

05:31.665 --> 05:33.759
nobody will have a reason
to pick me up.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.503
Stay out of trouble.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.298
That's the point.
We both stay out of trouble.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.432
Say I get nicked
and you're with me, baby.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.264
Who brings the fucking bail money?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.894
What up, J?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.651
Now?
Yeah, I got something to do.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.352
You know what? Forget it.
I'll meet you downstairs.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.277
Was that Julio? What's goin' on?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.701
- I just want to help.
- If you want to help,

05:59.818 --> 06:01.538
I'll give you something to do,
but not this.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.455
For now, just go get
the goddamn dog food, okay?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.845
- Yo, hold up.
- The fuck?

06:18.003 --> 06:20.381
Yo, Poncho. What'd I miss?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.265
They broke our agreement.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
- Those corners belong to us now.
- Oh, yeah?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.138
Ain't nobody heard from Vibora...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.021
Ruiz might not be around anymore,

06:32.183 --> 06:33.863
but I bet that we could
work something out.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.487
Motherfucker,
ain't nothing to work out.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.398
Whoever you are,
this don't concern you.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.447
If you don't want trouble,
blanquito...

06:43.069 --> 06:45.071
You better go back to Midtown
where you belong.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.492
Relax, because if you
don't want trouble...

06:49.367 --> 06:51.461
y'all would get the fuck off
Soldado corners.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.794
Because if you don't, I'm gonna be
dragging his nuts across your face.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.350
Let's go!

07:25.737 --> 07:27.535
Alley clear.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.328
Yo, what the fuck?

07:33.495 --> 07:35.293
Ruiz arranged a deal

07:35.455 --> 07:37.695
where they will stay off the corners
in this neighborhood

07:37.720 --> 07:39.313
if we kick back to
the head of the ALM.

07:39.471 --> 07:40.593
So fucking pay him.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.595
I don't have any products to sell.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.177
I don't have any products.
I don't have any money.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.808
No products, no money,
no fucking kickbacks, man.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.096
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Yo, Tommy,

07:50.261 --> 07:51.934
if you don't come through soon,

07:52.097 --> 07:54.316
I'm gonna have to get my shit
somewhere else, man.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.193
When is the re-up comin'?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.229
And where the fuck is Ghost?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.576
I saw the head count.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.201
It's even more people
than you said would show.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.869
We don't even know
what the numbers mean.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.409
I mean, I think more people's
better than not more people.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.055
We got good numbers tonight,
but most of that shit's coming off

08:15.214 --> 08:16.894
the buzz of me buying
the clubs from Stern.

08:16.919 --> 08:19.132
It ain't like slangin' dope.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.963
Drugs sell themselves.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.003
Legit shit takes more work,
more finesse.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.638
Looking the part is the first step.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.342
Could you go downstairs and make sure
that security's got this place on lock?

08:34.366 --> 08:36.649
Last thing we need is
someone getting in with a gun.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.903
Grand reopening,
grand reclosing for real.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.404
All right, no doubt. I hear you.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.315
- I got you, Ghost.
- Another thing.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.030
When we're here,
use your real name.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.787
When you cross that doorway here,
you're Andre, and forget Ghost.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.248
Call me James.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.431
Jamie, I'm sorry I have to go,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.684
but I have to be at work
early tomorrow.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.850
It's quite all right.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.019
Duty calls. I get it.

10:02.227 --> 10:06.403
The club looked better
because you were in it.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.073
- The last time I was here...
- Don't do that.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.582
Come on, Angie.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.495
I'd rather remember
the first time.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.915
It's all kind of a blur.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.092
Is that a challenge?

10:28.628 --> 10:33.384
Because I have no problem
reminding you.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.980
What if someone comes in here?

10:39.848 --> 10:43.853
Well, too bad for them,
because the doors automatically lock.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.191
Since when?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.356
Since I got them fixed.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.743
Besides, it's my club.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.946
- Jamie.
- It's my desk.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.095
What's wrong?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.102
Did the police tell you
what happened to Shawn?

12:03.127 --> 12:05.270
You told us you were gonna tell us
when they called.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.561
They haven't called back yet, 'Riq.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.606
All they told me
was that he passed.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.317
I just want to know what happened.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.036
Me too, baby.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.163
Me too.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.505
Oh, sorry.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.298
That was my bad.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.214
I think I'm used to being
in here alone in the morning.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.510
And I think I'm used to more space.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.433
I mean, you know,
I love your place, but...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.313
No, no, it's fine.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.190
Of course you are.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.696
But you know what?
We'll get the hang of it.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.320
And then we'll move.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.403
I thought you said
you liked my apartment.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.989
Come here.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.746
Honestly,
I'm a little nervous this morning.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.206
I'm going to ask my boss for
a transfer to another department.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.924
Because?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.801
Because I think
I'm ready for a change.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.337
Time to start something new.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.926
I want to be head of a department.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.184
Maybe in Victim Witness
or White Collar, I'll have a shot.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.856
It could mean I'd be working
more hours, though.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.652
With three clubs,

13:31.811 --> 13:34.109
I'll be working more hours,
that's for sure.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.322
Not a lot of time left for you
or for the kids.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.657
I'm ready to meet them

13:43.823 --> 13:45.951
when you're ready for that.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.290
Whenever that is.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.176
Sure, babe.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.304
Sounds good.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.305
I wasn't stalking her.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.472
I know you weren't,
but when it comes to this shit,

14:09.515 --> 14:10.812
women have all the power.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.898
Nobody wants to get sued,
especially not the DOJ.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.189
She should be in prison.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.653
She's fucking James St. Patrick,

14:17.815 --> 14:20.910
and she knows that
he's Lobos' New York distro.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.992
She knows he's Ghost.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.703
If you want to prove Angela
had criminal intent

14:25.865 --> 14:28.025
to protect St. Patrick,
you'd have to prove St. Patrick

14:28.050 --> 14:30.871
is involved with Lobos first,
and this could all be moot anyway.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.197
I don't even know if we're
going forward with the case.

14:33.222 --> 14:36.092
Lobos was stabbed in custody,
severe injuries.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.378
- Last I heard, it was touch and go.
- Holy shit.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.172
Looks like the Jimenez
hit his whole network.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.433
Vladimir Jankovic
and Drifty are dead.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.843
Ruiz is in the wind.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.103
You guys sure it was the Jimenez?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.854
Let it go.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.356
You'll come back off suspension.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.635
You'll transfer to another
department away from Valdes

14:52.767 --> 14:55.020
and put this all behind you.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.658
Okay, you really need
to get some, dude.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.533
You go blast one off to get your head
where it needs to be.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.572
Yeah.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.219
No, yeah,
you're probably right there.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.660
You got any leads?

15:11.702 --> 15:14.125
- I'm gonna let it go.
- Good.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.882
Thanks for coming by.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.902
Stern's VIP guest list.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.572
I got it right before he fired me, and
then I deleted the file from his records.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.911
It'll take him at least
a month to rebuild it.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.667
That's nice work.

15:53.578 --> 15:57.003
I set up those new meetings with the
new security firms like you asked.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.088
Good. Time to upgrade there too.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.877
Agreed.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.757
I'm gonna head over to Verbatim.

16:09.093 --> 16:13.439
Kantos, Andre here's gonna go over
with you so you can show him around.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.600
Give us a minute if you will.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.154
All right, so look, man.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.949
This club shit is all right,

16:31.115 --> 16:35.120
but I want to know when we're gonna
mix it up, move some weight.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.047
Look, I figure, you know, since you're
not fucking with Tommy no more,

16:38.072 --> 16:40.216
you need somebody
in that shotgun seat.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.797
I mean,
just holler at your boy, man.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.214
- What's our new hustle?
- The club is the new hustle.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.145
I promised to get you
off of a corner,

16:56.307 --> 16:57.684
to get you out of the hood.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.150
I guaranteed you a fat paycheck, but
you're gonna put that shit in the bank,

17:01.312 --> 17:03.485
not in your goddamn mattress.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.401
I said I want to look clean like you.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.194
I ain't never say I want to be clean.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.829
- I want money, man.
- You're gonna get that.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.867
You want a better life
for your daughter or not?

17:16.493 --> 17:18.775
You want to look over your shoulder
the rest of your life?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.223
So you not looking over
your shoulder, just like that?

17:26.671 --> 17:30.050
I was thinking if I want
to move forward in my career,

17:30.216 --> 17:33.015
maybe Violent Crimes
isn't the best place for me to do it,

17:33.177 --> 17:35.521
at least not here
in Southern District.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.604
- You want a transfer?
- I want a fresh start.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.860
And when Greg Knox
comes back to work,

17:41.018 --> 17:43.862
it might be best for me
to be somewhere else.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.695
I think there's some openings
at the Eastern District office

17:46.857 --> 17:48.617
- out at Cadman Plaza...
- I'm sorry, Angela.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.865
You can't go anywhere.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.450
I need you here
to help the Lobos task force.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.126
- I thought the case might be over.
- You thought wrong.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.084
Lobos woke up. He's stable.

18:01.247 --> 18:05.218
So we're proceeding with the case.
We're due in chambers in 20 minutes.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.982
In light of
the government's inability

19:10.149 --> 19:12.277
to protect my client,
Felipe Lobos,

19:12.443 --> 19:14.946
I move that all federal charges
against him be dropped

19:15.112 --> 19:16.955
and that he be returned to Mexico,

19:17.114 --> 19:19.492
where the Federals
can handle his prosecution.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.286
You know they're not
gonna prosecute him.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.292
You're looking for
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

19:23.317 --> 19:24.872
Get-out-alive, Mr. Sandoval.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.633
My client's life is in danger
as long as he's in your custody.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.840
It's clear that whoever
wanted the defendant dead

19:30.002 --> 19:31.242
knew exactly where to find him.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.633
Has the government addressed the issue
of the defendant's safety in its papers?

19:34.799 --> 19:36.999
Not at this time, Your Honor,
but it's clear the Jimenez

19:37.134 --> 19:38.734
hired an assassin
from within the prison.

19:38.759 --> 19:40.855
Your Honor,
if you send Lobos to Mexico,

19:41.013 --> 19:42.981
he'll go right back
to conducting business,

19:43.140 --> 19:45.820
- selling drugs, ordering murders...
- That's the Federals' problem.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.523
Your Honor, if I may,

19:47.687 --> 19:50.816
what if we helped the idea
that Lobos is dead?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.824
- Helped?
- We freeze his assets.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.583
We start seizing
his American properties.

19:54.746 --> 19:56.466
We spread the word
through the prison system

19:56.491 --> 19:59.495
that the Jimenez killed the defendant,
and we mount a John Doe prosecution.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.706
We never put his name on a prisoner
manifest, we move him in secret,

20:02.868 --> 20:06.247
and all materials associated with
"U.S. v. John Doe" remain under seal.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.667
Your Honor,
the Eastern District has prosecuted

20:08.833 --> 20:10.927
almost 60 John Doe cases
in the last five years.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.338
You want my client to waive
his right to a public trial

20:13.504 --> 20:14.864
because you can't
keep people safe?

20:15.005 --> 20:17.679
A John Doe prosecution
would give the government the ability

20:17.842 --> 20:20.516
to protect the defendant while
prosecuting him for his crimes

20:20.678 --> 20:22.351
against the people
of the United States.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.233
It is a solution
in the interest of justice.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.602
Isn't that why we're here?

20:27.768 --> 20:30.191
Game, set, match, Mr. Kessler.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.856
The government's motion
is granted,

20:32.022 --> 20:34.616
and the John Doe prosecution
will move forward.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.621
Mr. Sandoval, I expect extraordinary
measures here from your staff.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.873
No DOJ property
leaves the building,

20:41.031 --> 20:44.706
no laptops, no files,
and restricted smartphone use.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.212
I understand, Your Honor.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.043
All proceedings from this point

20:48.205 --> 20:50.958
shall be maintained under seal,
Counselors.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.674
I'm due in court.
You'll see yourselves out?

20:57.381 --> 21:00.601
I'd like to go with you to interview
Lobos if that's okay, Mike.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.809
I'll get back to you.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.531
The kids are at school already.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.823
I know they aren't here.
Came to talk to you.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.294
Tasha, when they are here, we need to
sit both Tariq and Raina down and...

21:29.246 --> 21:31.465
tell 'em about Angela.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.756
About Angela?

21:34.919 --> 21:37.672
What about Shawn, Ghost?

21:37.838 --> 21:40.011
What about the fact that
someone who was in their lives

21:40.174 --> 21:42.893
is suddenly dead
with no explanation?

21:45.596 --> 21:47.064
Don't pretend like you didn't know.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.351
- I knew.
- Then why didn't you tell me?

21:50.518 --> 21:53.522
The police called me to identify his body.
I called you, Ghost.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.440
I had to tell the kids
about Shawn alone.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.777
- What'd you tell them?
- That he died, Ghost.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.412
What else was I supposed to say?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.952
You got anything
you need to tell them?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.462
Anything you want
to get off your chest?

22:10.621 --> 22:12.965
What happened
to your face, Ghost?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.296
Were you in a fight?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.807
You think I did this to him?

22:24.301 --> 22:26.474
I told you, I sent him away.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.310
You tell me a lot of things.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.540
I told Shawn that Kanan
was using him to get to me.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.419
Instead of leaving town,
Shawn went to Kanan

22:48.492 --> 22:50.745
to confront his father
about what I told him.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.337
And Kanan shot him.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.809
So my face looks like this
because I killed Kanan.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.351
Kanan is dead?

23:14.518 --> 23:15.986
And Lobos too.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.356
I'm out the game.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.741
Why should I believe
anything you have to say?

23:23.694 --> 23:27.324
I know it's easy for you
to blame me for Shawn's death.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.707
And I know I've lied to you
in the past.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.294
Don't touch me.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.056
I'm sorry you had to do that alone.
I should have been here.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.092
But you can ask Tommy.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.636
When he went to see Kanan,

23:48.802 --> 23:50.896
I was with Tommy,
getting him out of jail.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.865
Call me when you're ready to talk.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.574
So, man, the heat
you were getting from the Feds,

24:09.740 --> 24:12.789
- it's all gone now?
- All gone.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.330
They can't even
try to come get me now.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.419
Yo, I know the product,
and I know the game.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.381
And now that I've seen
how they work up close,

24:19.406 --> 24:22.126
I know even better how to move
serious weight without law enforcement

24:22.151 --> 24:23.504
suspecting a goddamn thing.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.299
I'm gonna get you the best product
at the best price.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.934
The shipments will be reliable,
and they'll be on time.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.936
And not on Sundays.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.768
I'm a little busy on Sundays.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.807
Yeah, I got you.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.478
And if anybody ever fuck with you,
they fuck with me.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.764
And people that fuck with me, well, they
end up on the wrong side of the grass.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.114
So how green
you want to fucking get?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.129
You know,
I know you from somewhere.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.669
Didn't you used to roll
with that black guy, Ghost?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.509
Used to, past tense.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.550
- Why, is there a problem?
- No, there is no problem.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.344
L just don't like doing business
with niggers.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.433
Can't trust them.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.812
You'll be hearing from me soon.

25:21.687 --> 25:25.032
You're way more expensive
than the other top security firms.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.988
I've heard we're about
twice as much.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.324
- You heard right.
- We're worth it.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.660
My men are military trained
at identifying conflict

25:32.823 --> 25:35.497
and suppressing it before
the situation gets out of hand.

25:35.659 --> 25:39.163
They contain and control because
once a brawl breaks out, it's too late.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.331
If you hire me,
you and your patrons

25:41.498 --> 25:43.842
will be completely safe
within these walls,

25:44.001 --> 25:46.504
safer than
they've ever been before.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.180
Darryl, it's Ange.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.686
I need to talk to you
about Greg Knox.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.443
That was nice work
with Judge Cross today.

26:01.602 --> 26:04.321
You know, she's a battle-ax,
but she never ignores precedent.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.033
I think we both rose
to the occasion.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.615
That's what's so frustrating
about you, Valdes.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.018
You know how to be a good prosecutor
when you want to be.

26:13.043 --> 26:15.408
Maybe that's why Mike
keeps you around,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.123
'cause you're the Calamity Jane
of this fuckin' department,

26:18.285 --> 26:20.879
and yet somehow
you're still on this case.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.292
I guess you've forgotten how
we arrested Lobos in the first place.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.459
If it gets out that Lobos is alive,
whoever tried to kill him the first time

26:28.484 --> 26:30.138
will come back for round two.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.890
That could happen.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.801
Could? Will.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.392
And if Lobos isn't kept under strict seal,
he could order a preemptive hit,

26:37.554 --> 26:40.979
give orders for a retaliation kill
right from his cell.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.311
The person who ordered the hit
would be in danger.

26:44.478 --> 26:47.072
I don't give a shit if one of
the Jimenez assholes gets clipped

26:47.231 --> 26:51.111
because they tried to kill Lobos,
but my career is on the line here.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.620
Any mistake you make
to jeopardize this case,

26:53.779 --> 26:55.622
I'll go to Collins if I have to...

26:55.781 --> 26:59.081
I don't give a fuck...
To make sure you're removed.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.470
Tommy, what the hell?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.093
What you want, Tash?

27:17.052 --> 27:19.680
I want to know why you haven't
been returning my calls.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.441
I've been trying to tell you
that Shawn is dead.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.862
- What happened to him?
- Ghost says Kanan did it.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.781
And that he killed
Kanan afterwards,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.917
but I don't believe a word
that motherfucker says anymore.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.615
Oh, yeah? Me either.
Good luck with that.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.200
- What happened between you?
- It don't matter what happened.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.956
Can't change it now.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.868
Tommy, for the kids.
They need an explanation.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.208
I need to know
if Ghost killed Shawn.

27:45.747 --> 27:49.297
The night of that party at Truth,
the night you got out of jail.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.054
Ghost was with me.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.799
He picked me up.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.970
I know he killed Kanan too.
He ain't lying about that either.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.055
I'm sorry about Shawn.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.973
I'm sorry the kids
got to go through that.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.188
Ghost says he's out the game now.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.487
That why you mad at him?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.653
Good-bye, Tasha.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.336
Is this a commentary
on my cooking?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.713
If I said no,
would you believe me?

28:33.629 --> 28:36.029
You know, it was nice having you
at the club the other night.

28:36.054 --> 28:38.898
It felt... right.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.687
Yeah, for me too.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.773
Think you can
come again tomorrow?

28:50.354 --> 28:52.448
You know, if you don't have to
get up too early?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.325
Yeah, maybe.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.280
Jamie, there's something
we need to talk about.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.877
I have to go to Truth.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.713
The club doesn't open until 10:00.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.923
- You got to go right now?
- Yeah, right now, baby.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.087
I'm sorry.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.806
You know, some nights,
things come up unexpectedly.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.405
It's part of the nightlife business.

29:19.430 --> 29:22.775
You were saying something,
something you wanted to talk about?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.438
Just Paz stuff.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.894
It can wait.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.151
Go.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.732
Dominique, man,
you look gorgeous tonight.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.495
Now, make sure
you take care of this guy.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.610
Big spender.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.745
- Excuse me, you run this place?
- I do.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.959
Can I help you?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.250
Maybe, maybe not. Don't know.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.920
I was wondering about her.
She got a boyfriend or anything?

29:56.086 --> 29:58.430
I don't believe so, no.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.306
Good, thank you.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.059
- Welcome.
- What time you let 'em off work?

30:06.096 --> 30:08.269
I'll...

30:08.432 --> 30:10.605
I'll play by the rules.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.528
Look, I don't know what you heard
about me or where you heard it from,

30:13.553 --> 30:15.476
but I don't do that anymore.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.283
I must be misinformed.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.410
Don't be offended, Mr. Kantos.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.621
What can I do for you, Officer?

30:23.780 --> 30:25.460
Actually, I want to ask you
a few questions

30:25.485 --> 30:27.829
about Thomas Egan
and James St. Patrick.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.789
I haven't seen Tommy Egan
in a very long time.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.707
He never really hung out here much.

30:33.874 --> 30:37.219
As for James, anything you want to
ask him, you can ask him directly.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.378
He'll be in tomorrow.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.803
Now, if we're all clone here,
I'd be happy to cover your tab.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.467
Whole thing?

30:43.633 --> 30:46.762
Thank you. I'll see myself out.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.872
You noticed.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.914
Why am I not on a plane
to Mexico right now?

31:13.080 --> 31:16.425
Jefe, I tried to use the argument
this morning as we planned,

31:16.583 --> 31:19.132
but I told you
I couldn't control the judge.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.844
Apparently they've seized
all my assets,

31:27.010 --> 31:30.105
and I can't even afford to pay for
the gardener at my house in Polanco.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.517
And Manuel, he does amazing things
with roses, but not for free.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.401
We have to make it
look like you're dead.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.313
If your money's moving,
it means you're alive to move it.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.859
Now, I'm doing what I can to impede
the progress of the case.

31:42.025 --> 31:45.575
The La Arafia cards went back to the NYPD
precincts for each individual murder.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.536
When we want them back for evidence,
it'll take a year to find them.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.621
The only witnesses
that can hurt you are Ruiz,

31:50.784 --> 31:53.128
who we're looking for,
and Ghost.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.375
I have that under control.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.464
I will let you know
when we find Ruiz.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.432
Why in the world
would I ever give up

32:09.594 --> 32:12.473
my U.S. Attorney
that I have in my back pocket?

32:12.639 --> 32:15.734
I'm assuming that Ghost
is keeping his, right?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.769
Angela is with him,
yes, and I told you,

32:17.936 --> 32:20.655
she may be useful later
to help destroy your case.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.904
She wants to be present
at your next interview.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.068
Bring her.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.613
I want to see
if she breaks under pressure.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.329
If she's weak,
she may present too great a risk.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.461
If anything happens to Angela,
it will blow back on both of us.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.247
An U.S. Attorney dies
while prosecuting you?

32:37.414 --> 32:39.212
Forget it.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.675
You have to trust me, Jefe.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.763
I've taken care of
every loose end.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.045
Hello, sir.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.380
Good evening, sir.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.295
I'm here to visit a friend,
Tatiana Boriskaya.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.231
Sorry, there's no answer.
She's probably out.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.317
But if you like,
I could tell her you stopped by.

33:46.484 --> 33:49.444
No, I was just in the neighborhood,
so I'll catch up with her another time.

33:49.469 --> 33:50.408
All right? Take care.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.995
I take it, Mr. Lobos,
that your lawyer has explained

33:54.157 --> 33:57.536
- the John Doe prosecution to you.
- Yes, yes, yes, he has.

33:57.702 --> 34:01.002
Overnight I have no name,
no money, nothing.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.166
It's... it's like I ceased to exist

34:03.333 --> 34:06.086
all because I had
the grave misfortune

34:06.253 --> 34:10.099
of being stabbed
while I was in your custody,

34:10.257 --> 34:12.510
so I understand.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.774
Would you please describe the events
of the morning you were injured?

34:42.706 --> 34:45.129
Mr. Kessler, can you control
your client, please?

34:45.292 --> 34:48.387
We can talk about cocks
all day, Mr. Lobos,

34:48.545 --> 34:51.969
but you are going to
have to answer my questions.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.476
You can say
whatever you want to me.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.351
I'm not afraid of you.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.351
Is that a threat?

35:03.310 --> 35:05.483
We can add charges
to the indictment.

35:09.566 --> 35:10.943
What do you want to know?

35:12.569 --> 35:14.992
Your meal was delivered.
The slot was opened.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.032
What happened next?

35:42.015 --> 35:45.940
The only reason
why I am still alive

35:46.102 --> 35:49.777
is because the Jimenez
are so cheap.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.651
You get what you pay for.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.114
Shut up.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.121
And you're sure the Jimenez
sent the assassin?

35:57.280 --> 35:59.874
They've been trying to
kill me for months.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.128
Who else would try so hard
to put me down?

37:53.688 --> 37:56.157
He hadn't taken them yet.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.410
That church one
wasn't the easiest.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.648
The priest caught me, I actually had to
give a confession to get out of there.

38:01.673 --> 38:03.081
I bet you had plenty of material.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.912
You're a very dirty girl.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.497
Not dirty, creative.

38:14.501 --> 38:17.596
So why did you and Ghost have those
boxes stashed all over the city?

38:17.754 --> 38:19.756
In case shit ever popped off
and we had to split.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.267
It was Ghost's idea.
Half his money, half mine.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.099
Clean weapons, small bills.
Instant escape plan.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.808
It was smart.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.491
And I'm gonna hide them again
but in places he don't know about.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.939
And that's what
makes you smart, Tommy.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.774
Fuck Ghost.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.360
Yeah, fuck Ghost.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.617
You don't need him, Tommy.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.449
You're gonna be better off
without him.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.363
You're the boss now.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.953
You can do things
all your own way,

38:46.115 --> 38:48.959
the Tommy Egan way.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.086
The right way.

38:55.416 --> 38:59.011
Oh, fuck.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.762
Jesus, Tommy.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.481
- No, no, no, ignore it.
- I will.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.069
Just let me check.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.495
- Hello?
- Tomas?

39:24.654 --> 39:28.579
Jefe, what's up?

39:28.741 --> 39:31.244
I hear that
you're making headway

39:31.411 --> 39:33.505
in rebuilding the organization,
is that true?

39:33.663 --> 39:36.086
I don't know how you know that,
but you damn straight.

39:36.249 --> 39:39.844
I got the Soldados plus a bunch of
other primeras lined up,

39:40.003 --> 39:41.425
but I need that product.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.011
Tomas, did you forget our deal?

39:44.173 --> 39:47.393
First you kill Ghost,
then I send you the product.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.896
No, I did not forget, Jefe,

39:50.054 --> 39:53.558
but I can do what you asked me to do
and sell product at the same time.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.773
Good, because you're gonna
have to do just that.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.690
I'm experiencing an unexpected
cash flow problem,

39:59.856 --> 40:02.279
and, Tomas, I need money.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.537
The pickup arrangements
are the same.

40:05.695 --> 40:09.199
Nothing changes
except one thing.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.868
Everyone must think that I'm dead.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.129
- What?
- It's best for everybody

40:14.287 --> 40:18.087
if it is believed that Ghost's attempt
on my life was a success.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.592
Whatever you say, Jefe.

40:19.751 --> 40:24.382
I'm gonna send you the product,
but Ghost needs to be dead soon.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.676
Otherwise your little family...

40:29.052 --> 40:32.647
- they won't be safe.
- I understand.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.914
Kids,

40:49.072 --> 40:51.632
your-your mother and I have talked
to you about where we grew up.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.914
Yeah,
but you never take us there.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.250
That's because it can be
very dangerous, 'Riq.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.131
I mean, most people there are good,
but some people there are...

40:59.290 --> 41:01.588
- they're...
- Some people break the law for a living.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.753
- Yes.
- Shawn grew up there too.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.000
Some of the friends
he grew up with, they never left,

41:06.025 --> 41:09.199
and Shawn was spending
a lot of time with them.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.640
And, well, he got hurt.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.203
Okay, but if they were his friends,
why would they shoot him?

41:14.228 --> 41:16.149
It's the hood, baby.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.184
Situations can change
on the drop of a dime.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.511
He might have said the wrong thing
to the wrong person,

41:20.536 --> 41:22.780
or been in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.532
We'll never know for sure,

41:24.691 --> 41:28.195
but we want you two
to understand that you're safe.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.489
As long as you follow our rules.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.532
Daddy, when are you coming home?

41:36.285 --> 41:38.663
Baby girl, there's no plans
on me doing that.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.800
- But why?
- We love you both.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.801
That has not changed.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.803
And, yes, there will be
a few changes,

41:45.962 --> 41:47.839
and it's a transition
for all of us,

41:48.006 --> 41:50.885
but you can always come to me
if you need to talk.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.303
Or me.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.076
You know, he'll be okay.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.987
I hope you're right, Ghost.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.537
You don't need to use
that name, Tasha.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.082
Just call me James.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.672
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

42:25.835 --> 42:27.508
Fuck you!

42:28.755 --> 42:31.008
Come on.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.347
There you go. There you go.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.728
Don't look down, Chalupa.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.439
We're higher than a giraffe's pussy.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.899
It's dangerous up here.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.942
Dangerous, like when you
fuck with the Soldados,

42:46.105 --> 42:47.573
like when you shoot one of them.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.732
I'm gonna shoot your mama
in the face with my dick!

42:49.859 --> 42:51.059
- What was that?
- I'm gonna...

42:56.908 --> 42:59.707
Yo, J, you see?

42:59.869 --> 43:02.372
He didn't die.
I knew that shit would work.

43:02.538 --> 43:06.463
- Guess I lost that bet.
- Nah, he did.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.058
- Now...
- No! No, please.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.561
I promise I'll do
whatever you want.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.313
I promise I won't fuck
with the Soldados ever.

43:20.056 --> 43:22.104
- Please.
- You're damn right.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.819
Hey.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.106
No, no, look at me.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.865
Look at me!

43:30.983 --> 43:32.303
I want you to remember this face,

43:32.443 --> 43:35.117
because if anyone from the ALM
fucks with the Soldados again,

43:35.279 --> 43:37.247
I'm the man
that's gonna kill you.

43:37.406 --> 43:40.080
You work for me, you're protected.
You fuck with me, you're dead.

43:40.243 --> 43:42.086
You think you could
tell everybody that?

43:42.245 --> 43:44.168
Yeah, you got it.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.048
No problem.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.211
So can I please
get out of this, please?

43:51.087 --> 43:53.590
No.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.764
- T, what the fuck, man?
- What?

43:57.927 --> 44:00.247
He might have a couple broken bones,
but he can still talk.

44:00.272 --> 44:02.140
That's my fucking point, Tommy.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.684
The fuck you thinking
showing your face, man?

44:04.851 --> 44:06.148
What you think Ghost's gonna say

44:06.310 --> 44:08.190
when this shit gets back to him
off the streets?

44:08.855 --> 44:10.448
Shut your fucking mouth.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.450
Ghost ain't here.
He don't exist.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.328
I don't want to hear
his fucking name again.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.745
Yeah. Yeah, man.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.638
♪ Money, money, money ♪

44:35.256 --> 44:36.849

- Why are you here?
- Tommy threw a guy

45:00.823 --> 45:02.166
off a building tonight.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.525
Now, I'm not saying that
motherfucker didn't deserve it,

45:04.550 --> 45:05.753
but Tommy took credit for it.

45:05.912 --> 45:09.667
He literally pulled his mask off and told
the guy's friend to spread the word.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.676
He would have never done
that if you were there.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.179
He says you're out.

45:15.338 --> 45:17.932
What the hell happened?

45:18.090 --> 45:20.013
He's right. I'm out.

45:22.178 --> 45:24.772
This club, this life,
this is who I am now.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.524
I didn't get in this game
to work for Tommy.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.436
You got me out of the gang, you.

45:30.603 --> 45:34.198
You set me up so I can take care of
my family, not Tommy.

45:34.357 --> 45:35.904
What do you want me to say?

45:36.067 --> 45:37.819
Tommy Egan's the boss now.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.285
Guess you better do
what he wants.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.840
Well, then I better go
do a pickup down on Elizabeth.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.542
Shit, I best hit the road.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.552
You're still doing pickups
on Elizabeth?

45:55.711 --> 45:57.554
Yes. Nothing's changed.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.177
You're telling me you're still
working with Lobos?

46:03.219 --> 46:04.266
Why wouldn't we be?

46:04.428 --> 46:07.898
Tommy didn't say shit, but my guess is,
Lobos is still inside moving weight.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.560
Nothing's gonna stop
the motherfucker till he's dead.

46:10.726 --> 46:13.149
We need you out on these streets.

46:14.063 --> 46:15.906
I need you.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.863
Tommy's gonna get us all
fucking killed.

46:21.821 --> 46:23.664
Take care of yourself, man.

46:23.823 --> 46:25.245
What is that supposed to mean?

46:26.409 --> 46:28.286
It means take care of yourself.

47:37.730 --> 47:39.482
Hey, Darryl.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.995
I was just wondering,
did you get anything

47:45.154 --> 47:47.074
off the Greg Knox
cell phone trace I asked about?

47:47.099 --> 47:48.491
Angela, hi.

47:48.657 --> 47:51.160
I need to know
if he's still stalking me, Darryl.

47:51.307 --> 47:53.387
I know, but if you're really
that concerned about it,

47:53.412 --> 47:55.092
you need to go through
the proper channels.

47:55.117 --> 47:56.169
Get a protective detail.

47:56.332 --> 47:59.336
You know I love you, but you're real
radioactive around here these days,

47:59.502 --> 48:02.346
and if I get caught helping you,
I can get fired.

48:02.505 --> 48:05.133
- Good luck with Greg, Ange.
- Darryl...

48:25.528 --> 48:27.656
What the fuck?

48:32.660 --> 48:34.207
What's up, Dre?
You need something?

48:34.370 --> 48:36.043
Man, I was just looking for a tie.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.003
Aren't I Andre now?

48:38.999 --> 48:41.001
Yeah, I guess so.
Yo, you strapped?

48:44.380 --> 48:46.553
I mean,
never leave home without it.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.306
You want me to change that too?

48:54.390 --> 48:55.892
No.

48:57.393 --> 48:59.111
All right.

49:01.814 --> 49:03.566
Hey, James,
I called you last night.

49:03.732 --> 49:04.733
You didn't pick up.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.460
I need to talk to youse
about something right now.

49:06.485 --> 49:09.445
I want to know, did you send invitations
to the grand opening for Verbatim?

49:09.470 --> 49:11.282
- Yup.
- To everybody on Stern's VIP list?

49:11.323 --> 49:12.883
Yeah, every single one.
It's right here.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.828
- Perfect, thanks.
- It's not about that, though.

49:14.853 --> 49:16.776
It's all right.
We'll talk later, I promise.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.007
Hey, folks.

49:22.835 --> 49:25.588
I want to extend
my appreciation to you all

49:25.754 --> 49:29.725
for stepping up to make the launch
of JSP Nightlife come to fruition.

49:32.970 --> 49:36.691
An ideal employee is loyal,
trustworthy, fully committed.

49:36.849 --> 49:39.272
I've been trying to find someone

49:39.435 --> 49:41.312
that can serve in the role
of general manager

49:41.479 --> 49:43.277
for all three of our clubs.

49:43.439 --> 49:45.988
Josh Kantos,
would you come up here, please?

49:47.109 --> 49:49.203
- Nice, Josh.
- Yeah, Josh.

49:50.279 --> 49:53.032
Kantos here...

49:53.199 --> 49:56.544
is the exact opposite of everything
I want this place to be.

49:57.786 --> 50:00.790
From now on, this lying, bullshitting,
backstabbing piece of shit

50:00.956 --> 50:02.958
isn't welcome on these premises.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.325
If you see him here after today,
in fact, call security.

50:05.461 --> 50:07.421
Matter of fact,
I think they're ready for him now.

50:07.446 --> 50:08.631
James, James, you need me.

50:08.797 --> 50:10.357
You-you can't run this place
without me.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.422
I can, and I will.
Get him the fuck out of my sight.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.304
Loyalty is everything to me.

50:15.471 --> 50:17.599
I deserve it, and I demand it.

50:19.433 --> 50:22.152
Now, let's get to work.

50:22.311 --> 50:25.155
Yo, Tommy,
that shit with Chuleta, man,

50:25.314 --> 50:27.817
- I'm hearing it from everybody, yo.
- Yeah?

50:27.983 --> 50:30.577
Now people know
not to fuck with us or with you.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.158
Glad to hear it.

50:32.321 --> 50:35.200
Yo, good looking out, man,

50:35.366 --> 50:37.084
for that and the weight.

50:37.243 --> 50:39.086
Got it this morning.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.461
- Vaya.
- Vaya.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.219
Nice work getting the product out
to them so fast.

50:47.378 --> 50:50.678
Yeah, man, we got the weight,
but the shipment was light.

50:50.839 --> 50:53.183
You feed the Soldados first?
Reward Poncho's loyalty?

50:53.342 --> 50:55.686
No doubt, but the other primeras
might get pissed.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.444
Can you think of a reason why Lobos
wouldn't send the full amount?

50:58.514 --> 51:00.061
No, I'll ask him, though.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.544
Listen, as far as the streets
are concerned, Lobos is dead.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.904
Only you and I know
any different, all right?

51:05.062 --> 51:06.742
Why does he want people
to think he's dead?

51:06.767 --> 51:09.033
I don't know, and I don't care.

51:09.191 --> 51:11.239
I'm just doing what that
crazy motherfucker says.

51:11.402 --> 51:13.780
Look, Ghost ain't coming back.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.198
I'm number one now.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.866
And you could be number two,

51:17.032 --> 51:19.535
but you ain't never gonna
second-guess me again.

51:19.702 --> 51:22.205
Either you're in, or you out.

51:23.872 --> 51:26.466
- I'm in.
- Good.

51:36.093 --> 51:39.017
Never really reheats the same.

51:39.972 --> 51:41.895
Yeah, you're right.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.481
Who was that guy last night?

51:49.523 --> 51:50.900
What guy?

51:51.066 --> 51:54.570
At the club, with the big
718 tattoo on his neck.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.739
Latino, tall.

51:56.905 --> 52:00.079
It's a gang tattoo,
Toros Locos in the Bronx.

52:01.577 --> 52:03.420
Look at you.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.673
Been holding out on me.

52:05.831 --> 52:07.754
I never knew you ran
with the Toros.

52:11.420 --> 52:15.095
- You promised to forgive my past.
- I promised I would try.

52:15.758 --> 52:19.103
Who is he, and why did he
come to the club last night?

52:20.971 --> 52:23.065
He grew up in the Toros.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.606
I got him out a few years ago.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.442
His name is Julio.

52:28.604 --> 52:29.947
And what does he do now?

52:31.607 --> 52:33.280
Now?

52:33.442 --> 52:35.410
I can't tell you that.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.282
But he used to work for me.

52:46.622 --> 52:49.922
He came to the club
because he didn't believe I was out.

52:50.751 --> 52:53.049
I told him it was over.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.423
It's over, Angie.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.770
I don't know how else
to make you believe me.

53:03.722 --> 53:06.646
I don't know what else
I have to do.

53:08.769 --> 53:10.442
Hey.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.032
How hard are you willing to try?

53:14.191 --> 53:16.910
Because if we can't be honest
with each other,

53:17.069 --> 53:19.822
may as well give up right now.

53:25.411 --> 53:28.506
- Felipe Lobos is alive.
- What?

53:32.167 --> 53:35.762
He survived the attack in prison.
All the records are sealed.

53:35.921 --> 53:39.175
As far as the public is concerned,
he died, but he didn't.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.343
If this information gets out, Jamie,

53:41.510 --> 53:44.514
if he is hurt and they trace this
back to me,

53:44.680 --> 53:47.183
I wouldn't just lose my job
or my license.

53:47.349 --> 53:49.772
- I would go to prison.
- I understand.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.029
I talked to him.

53:54.982 --> 53:56.199
You talked to Lobos?

53:56.358 --> 53:59.282
He thinks the Jimenez
ordered the attack.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.501
You're safe. It's all over.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.798
I guess Ghost really is dead.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.219
Holly.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.267
Holly?

54:25.429 --> 54:27.852
I got you that shitty
pan pizza you like.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.989
Where you at?

55:31.578 --> 55:35.173
- I want to lie here forever.
- Well, then you should.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.839
But I can't.

55:38.001 --> 55:40.379
I got to take a shower
and get myself ready

55:40.546 --> 55:41.968
for the real world tomorrow.
