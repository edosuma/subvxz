02:15.980 --> 02:17.807
<i>Third day of high school, and I,</i>

02:18.024 --> 02:21.060
<i>Victor Knudsen, was hit by an epidemic.</i>

02:23.445 --> 02:26.779
<i>And we're not talking about your
everyday epidemic like chicken pox.</i>

02:26.990 --> 02:31.237
<i>Or the flu. Nope, we're talking
a case of total, incurable...</i>

02:31.453 --> 02:33.694
<i>"Anya-itis".</i>

02:35.206 --> 02:36.949
Hello, gorgeous.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.542
<i>It's not so much the fact</i>

02:38.751 --> 02:41.835
<i>that she's the most beautiful
girl in the history of the world.</i>

02:42.046 --> 02:44.371
<i>It's that... well...</i>

02:47.801 --> 02:50.374
- Whassup, ladies?
- Hey, Peter!

02:56.935 --> 02:58.643
Why don't you boys
go park my precious?

02:58.853 --> 03:00.810
Sure thing, Peter.

03:01.022 --> 03:03.347
If you scratch her, you die.

03:05.526 --> 03:08.729
Open house this evening.
Please come by.

03:20.707 --> 03:24.455
Nothing feels quite like expensive wheels.
Not even sex.

03:27.004 --> 03:29.244
You ladies should stop by Nick
and Ernie's party tonight.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.750
It's gonna be off the hook.

03:30.966 --> 03:34.335
Especially you mama.
I'll make sure you're on the VIP list.

03:34.553 --> 03:36.676
Take a hike, losers.

03:36.888 --> 03:38.928
They'd never set foot
at your retarded little party.

03:42.894 --> 03:44.721
Yo, Vic!

03:45.230 --> 03:46.640
Hey, Vic!

03:47.482 --> 03:49.557
Is he even alive?

03:49.775 --> 03:53.025
<i>Come on, this is your big chance.</i>

03:53.237 --> 03:56.191
<i>Never mind the fact that she's the
world's most unattainable girl.</i>

03:56.407 --> 03:59.407
<i>And that's... maybe her boyfriend.</i>

03:59.618 --> 04:02.572
<i>Just walk on up to her and invite
her to Ernie's party tonight.</i>

04:02.787 --> 04:06.999
So what if she's a Senior?
Nothing. It means nothing.

04:08.626 --> 04:10.951
<i>Oh my god, what a smile!</i>

04:15.424 --> 04:16.863
I don't think we've been introduced.

04:16.926 --> 04:19.416
Huh, no we haven't.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.428
<i>Those eyes...</i>

04:22.556 --> 04:24.513
My name's Vic...

04:31.314 --> 04:32.974
"Viccup"?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.104
That sure looks like your
geek brother trying to score.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.859
How freaking stupid can you
be, trying to score a Senior?

04:43.075 --> 04:46.159
Must run in the family.
You wrote Paris Hilton, didn't you?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.991
She's not a Senior now, is she?

04:49.206 --> 04:51.875
Besides, she's much more mature
than high school chicks.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.791
Right.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.830
We could make the catastrophic
film of the century

04:59.048 --> 05:00.756
about Victor and Anya.

05:00.966 --> 05:03.338
<i>"What not to do when one
wants to get some ass".</i>

05:03.552 --> 05:05.628
We're gonna win Sundance!

05:05.846 --> 05:08.515
You do the directing,
I'll cast the floozies.

05:08.724 --> 05:10.716
- Score!
- Yeah!

05:12.727 --> 05:16.179
I think Esmeralda is just about ready...

05:16.397 --> 05:18.556
<i>Adios, mamacita.</i>

05:18.775 --> 05:21.182
Now there's pussy in the air, boys.

05:21.402 --> 05:25.316
- She sure does slide nicely.
- Why Esmeralda?

05:25.531 --> 05:28.069
We can name her Anya if you prefer.

05:28.283 --> 05:29.481
What do you think Ernest?

05:29.701 --> 05:32.868
This is America.
We can all dream, right?

05:33.538 --> 05:36.539
- Do you think she'll come?
- Not the first few times.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.908
Victor, my man, she's a Senior.

05:39.127 --> 05:41.582
You'd have a better chance
trying to score Angelina Jolie.

05:41.796 --> 05:45.081
I don't exactly think she walks
around dreaming about a 15 year old

05:45.299 --> 05:49.083
who's never had any,
except his own right hand.

06:14.326 --> 06:17.446
- Get lost, you little rug rat!
- Alright, fine. I'll leave.

06:17.663 --> 06:18.663
I'm sorry,

06:18.705 --> 06:21.077
I thought you were my hideous little
brother and his stupid camera.

06:21.291 --> 06:25.039
I don't think Brian looks
this great in a dress.

06:26.504 --> 06:29.838
Very sexy. You're out for some
trouble tonight, aren't you?

06:30.049 --> 06:32.042
- Aren't I always?
- Yeah.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.511
- Anya's bedroom, take four.
- Marker!

06:36.722 --> 06:39.639
Brian and Zack, that's it!!
Get the hell out of my room!

06:39.850 --> 06:41.392
One more time from the top, Sis.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.602
And maybe you could lose
the bathrobe in this take?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.931
Out now!

06:46.147 --> 06:46.847
Keep that expression, Anya.

06:47.065 --> 06:49.307
You're totally challenging
Uma Thurman in Kill Bill!

06:49.526 --> 06:50.984
Get out! Scram!

06:54.655 --> 06:57.775
Come on Anya, get dressed.

06:57.992 --> 07:00.909
The <i>Froshes</i> are having a
party and we're crashing it!

07:01.120 --> 07:02.530
What, Freshmen?

07:02.746 --> 07:06.032
Sure you'll fit right in.
They don't have sex either.

07:06.833 --> 07:07.833
Thanks.

07:27.436 --> 07:30.436
- Hey, Ernie!
- What's up, baby?

07:41.490 --> 07:44.859
No sandals next time, buddy.
We're running a classy joint here.

07:46.537 --> 07:49.906
Luckily, I'm in a good mood. Hello.

07:50.415 --> 07:52.906
Wearing dancing shoes.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.160
So, have you seen her yet?

07:58.381 --> 08:02.509
If you are referring to your lady
friend Anya, she was just here.

08:02.719 --> 08:04.676
- I told her to take a hike.
- You did what?

08:04.887 --> 08:07.287
She didn't have an invitation, man.
What do you want from me?

08:07.348 --> 08:09.839
But she doesn't, she doesn't need a... a...

08:10.059 --> 08:13.262
Bu, bu, but...
Okay, geez, I'm just joking.

08:13.478 --> 08:15.850
That broad has totally
ruined your sense of humor.

08:16.064 --> 08:18.982
Madames, proceed to
the Garden of Eden.

08:19.442 --> 08:21.020
Nice!

08:21.236 --> 08:23.359
Yo, this place is packed with hotties.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.525
Forget about Anya and just
grab whatever you can get.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.069
Which isn't a whole lot,

08:28.284 --> 08:31.154
but, you know, there's gotta
be someone desperate enough.

08:32.913 --> 08:37.241
Man, you are a lost cause. Go make
sure Ernie's still standing, will you?

08:38.043 --> 08:40.450
Come on, lets just try to
get into <i>Avalon</i> instead.

08:40.669 --> 08:43.126
Peter just texted me and said
it'd be happening tonight.

08:43.340 --> 08:46.424
Peter should just be happy you
are practicing on some toddlers.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.294
Thanks for the confidence.

08:51.347 --> 08:54.632
- Are you still scared?
- Of what?

08:54.850 --> 08:56.677
Of actually doing it with Peter.

08:56.894 --> 08:58.685
No.

08:59.229 --> 09:03.143
I mean, when we're alone together
he's really nice,

09:03.358 --> 09:05.564
and he says all the right
things, it's just...

09:05.777 --> 09:08.350
Anya, if you don't wanna do
it, you shouldn't do it.

09:08.571 --> 09:11.109
I do want to, I'm ready!

09:13.034 --> 09:16.983
I don't know. I guess I'm just
not sure if he's the right one.

09:18.038 --> 09:22.285
Listen, you can't just throw away
a woman's greatest treasure,

09:22.501 --> 09:24.577
just because he wants you to.

09:24.795 --> 09:28.246
You have to wait for
your one true love.

09:28.465 --> 09:31.216
The one you're gonna marry.

09:35.471 --> 09:38.140
- What was that?
- It's in the Bible.

09:41.352 --> 09:43.593
You guys ever hear of role playing?

09:43.812 --> 09:45.556
You got it, doll.

09:53.488 --> 09:56.691
Two of Ernie's famous home juice.

09:59.368 --> 10:02.654
Get lost girls, Hanna Montana
starts in 5 minutes.

10:05.207 --> 10:06.536
What was that?

10:13.882 --> 10:15.625
Hi...

10:17.302 --> 10:19.460
Such a lovely dress
you're wearing, Anya.

10:20.596 --> 10:24.048
Nice fabric. They don't make
them like that anymore.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.342
I just bought it, so I guess they do.

10:29.355 --> 10:31.762
Okay, Tom Ford, fashion week is over.

10:31.982 --> 10:34.852
- I'm Victor.
- Hi.

10:37.154 --> 10:38.648
Are you coming or what?

10:38.863 --> 10:41.401
It's the nicest dress
I've seen all night.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.575
Okay.

10:45.745 --> 10:49.161
That freshie really liked your dress.

10:49.373 --> 10:51.994
Hey, let's make a bet,
whoever gets a freshie hooked first,

10:52.209 --> 10:54.700
has to pick up the tab
later on at Avalon.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.628
You're on.

11:07.515 --> 11:10.469
It's the nicest dress
I've seen all night?

11:10.685 --> 11:14.468
That's the dumbest thing
I've said in my entire life!

11:18.525 --> 11:20.814
Ooooh!

11:21.820 --> 11:23.896
Freak out time!

11:48.261 --> 11:51.677
Just, just, just walk
up to her and say

11:51.890 --> 11:55.424
"Anya, baby, let's, let's groove.

11:55.643 --> 12:01.396
I got some... R-rated moves for ya."

12:01.607 --> 12:04.524
Dude, what are you doing in here, boy?

12:08.488 --> 12:11.109
Okay. Don't mind me.

12:12.409 --> 12:16.572
Hey, come on, close the
door, it's not that big.

12:18.748 --> 12:20.871
Or, is it?

12:34.512 --> 12:36.220
Come on, you guys, walk!

12:36.431 --> 12:38.507
You can do it.
One foot after the other.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.682
Don't tell me you're
talking to your feet, Vic?

12:40.893 --> 12:44.060
- No, I, I....
- Just go on up to her, man. Come on.

12:45.690 --> 12:46.769
Just do it, Vic.

12:49.109 --> 12:50.901
Do it, man,

12:55.949 --> 12:59.448
Here comes your lover boy to
comment on your dress again.

13:01.496 --> 13:04.829
I sense your credit card's
gonna hit the limit tonight.

13:22.182 --> 13:25.681
Victor, my man, you obviously
have something important to say.

13:28.020 --> 13:29.396
I'm, I'm sorry, what was that?

13:30.898 --> 13:33.519
Any hiccup experts in the house?

13:33.734 --> 13:34.849
I know a good trick.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.781
Come on, you've tortured
Victor long enough.

14:02.177 --> 14:07.717
So Victor, do you want me to try
to fix these hiccups of yours?

14:09.392 --> 14:14.469
I'll give you a great, big kiss if
you can do one more hiccup for me.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.335
Victor?

14:42.506 --> 14:44.499
Victor?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.626
Victor!

14:52.140 --> 14:54.548
So, what will it be, big boy?

15:05.778 --> 15:06.394
Go, buddy!

15:06.612 --> 15:08.071
I, I can't do it.

15:09.656 --> 15:13.606
But the most important thing is that
your hiccups are cured, right?

15:15.328 --> 15:17.535
Guess I'm stuck paying
the tab tonight.

15:17.747 --> 15:22.124
That's the price you have to pay
for having such a "lovely dress".

15:25.755 --> 15:30.048
- Hey, I got the hiccups too!
- No, no, no, no, I do!

15:44.772 --> 15:47.477
She would have kissed me!

16:05.166 --> 16:08.001
Zachary Jaaaaaaaaames!!!!

16:08.211 --> 16:11.212
That's my name, don't wear it out.
I got the copyright, lady.

16:11.422 --> 16:14.423
You know I can't stand spiders!

16:20.889 --> 16:22.597
Then it's a good thing
it's made out of licorice.

16:22.808 --> 16:25.299
Where did I go wrong?

16:25.519 --> 16:28.887
- When you and Dad were getting....
- Yes, thank you, young man.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.731
Sounds like you woke
up your mom, Zachary.

16:34.944 --> 16:37.731
- Good morning.
- Hi, Dad.

16:37.947 --> 16:40.105
What about Victor? Is he up yet?

16:40.324 --> 16:41.984
The old booze hound is hung over.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.692
Oh, don't be silly.
Your brother doesn't drink.

16:44.912 --> 16:46.738
Yeah, and I don't dig girls over 18.

16:48.331 --> 16:52.245
Victor, breakfast is ready!

16:52.752 --> 16:55.290
Oh, good morning.

16:57.465 --> 16:59.345
So son, any nice-looking
girls there last night?

16:59.467 --> 17:01.293
- Yeah, did you get any pussy?
- Zachary!

17:01.510 --> 17:03.633
You need to use a different
language, young man!

17:03.846 --> 17:07.179
Yes, Mom.
<i>Hizole consigue coño?</i>

17:08.099 --> 17:10.009
Did you get to bump into any big jugs?

17:10.227 --> 17:11.472
Stop it!

17:11.685 --> 17:13.726
Back in my day, we called them melons.

17:13.938 --> 17:15.053
Christian!

17:15.272 --> 17:17.598
Well, some people did,
but, no, no, not me.

17:17.817 --> 17:19.276
You know, I better get back to work.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.398
- Oh, don't forget this one.
- Thank you, son.

17:24.865 --> 17:25.944
See you.

17:26.157 --> 17:30.025
So, what kind of trouble are you
boys planning on getting into today?

17:30.245 --> 17:31.704
Nothing out of the ordinary,

17:31.914 --> 17:33.914
Maybe knock over a liquor
store, hit the titty bar.

17:34.082 --> 17:35.493
Oh, that's great!

17:36.710 --> 17:41.418
Hey, Mom, did anyone call?

17:41.631 --> 17:45.463
No. Who would have called?

17:46.427 --> 17:48.752
Oh, I don't know.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.096
What if she's crazy about me,
but just doesn't know it yet?

17:54.309 --> 17:57.595
In theory she already kissed me.
It's all subconscious.

17:58.021 --> 17:59.432
She even smiled at me this morning.

18:00.607 --> 18:03.643
Anya's the type who'd smile
at a child molester.

18:04.569 --> 18:07.523
If she likes you so much, why don't
you go over and talk to her?

18:07.738 --> 18:10.443
Well, she's sitting
with all the Seniors.

18:10.658 --> 18:13.742
What about that smart-ass Peter?
Is she dating him or what?

18:13.953 --> 18:16.622
No, I'm sure they're just
really good friends.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.617
Is Victor Knudsen really
gonna go down in history

18:19.833 --> 18:24.293
as the Kentucky fried chicken who
didn't dare fight for his own woman?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.674
You're right.

18:28.716 --> 18:32.251
No, time out, time out. Are you sure
there are no hiccups on their way up?

18:32.470 --> 18:33.501
I got it covered.

18:33.721 --> 18:37.421
I didn't drink a single sip
of water today, or yesterday.

18:38.308 --> 18:40.348
Good luck, Titanic!

18:40.561 --> 18:43.016
Can't you faint from dehydration?

18:44.815 --> 18:46.012
What's up ladies?

18:51.904 --> 18:54.858
Is this Candid Camera or did you
just say "what's up ladies"?

18:57.076 --> 18:59.614
I just wanted to say how great
it was to see you at the party.

19:01.038 --> 19:02.781
Me and my dress?

19:05.667 --> 19:08.267
Don't you know little Freshmen
aren't allowed at the Senior table?

19:08.962 --> 19:12.081
Last I checked there was
no reservation sign.

19:15.051 --> 19:17.531
Listen, you punk, I don't know
what you're trying to pull here,

19:17.678 --> 19:19.358
but don't ever talk to
any of us ever again

19:19.555 --> 19:21.797
or I'll split your skull in two!

19:23.517 --> 19:25.889
Go buy yourself a Hershey's kiss, kid.

19:26.103 --> 19:29.187
No one in their right mind would
ever give such a loser one for free.

19:33.234 --> 19:35.274
- Nice one!
- Huh? You like that? Like that?

19:35.487 --> 19:36.601
Well done.

19:41.784 --> 19:44.701
"Go buy yourself a
Hershey's kiss, kid".

19:48.040 --> 19:50.116
- Hurry up.
- Relax already.

19:52.878 --> 19:54.704
Check the stalls, will ya?

19:59.592 --> 20:01.917
Clear. Make this quick.

20:02.303 --> 20:06.087
I seem to remember you never liked
it when I was too quick about it.

20:06.307 --> 20:11.348
Look, I'm sick and tired of Anya and
her unspoiled, virgin bullshit.

20:11.562 --> 20:12.682
What is she trying to prove?

20:12.813 --> 20:16.063
Don't worry, she knows she
can't graduate a virgin.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.555
She said that?

20:17.776 --> 20:20.064
She said she wants to do it soon,

20:20.278 --> 20:23.777
and I told her the best way is to do it
with someone with experience.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.390
Someone who know's what he's doing.

20:27.451 --> 20:29.740
Thanks for the compliment.
Can't you...

20:29.954 --> 20:31.578
Prepare her a bit?

20:31.789 --> 20:35.158
- Prepare her, are you crazy?!
- Just give her a few tips.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.701
I'm going to her house on Wednesday
while her parents are playing Bridge.

20:37.919 --> 20:40.327
Seriously Peter, that's
between you two.

20:40.547 --> 20:44.331
I wanna see my girl happy and
I am not pushing her to do it.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.513
It was a lot easier with
you back in the day.

20:52.725 --> 20:54.599
All it took was a ride in
the Precious Junior

20:54.810 --> 20:56.850
and a twenty buck dinner.

20:57.062 --> 21:00.431
Besides, when I've had Anya too,
you girls can finally discuss sex.

21:00.649 --> 21:03.270
So, I guess I'll basically
be doing you a favor.

21:03.485 --> 21:05.145
<i>Chupa mi verga.</i>

21:05.362 --> 21:07.817
Keep talking dirty, baby.

21:13.369 --> 21:17.283
Okay, Casanova. So you're gonna
tell this girl you barely know

21:17.498 --> 21:20.582
that she shouldn't sleep with her
boyfriend even though she wants to?

21:20.793 --> 21:25.253
Well, he's not really her boyfriend.
But... yeah.

21:25.464 --> 21:27.954
- Great plan, Vic.
- Lt's not so bad.

21:29.259 --> 21:33.173
- Ah, God, you're so young.
- But Peter doesn't love her!

21:33.388 --> 21:36.175
So? When did that become
mandatory for love making?

21:37.350 --> 21:39.675
Come on guys, her house
isn't that far away.

21:40.853 --> 21:43.426
- Hancock Park.
- Oh, that's a rich neighborhood.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.567
Yeah, I bought the address off Zack.
He's friends with her little brother.

21:46.608 --> 21:49.064
Doesn't that make you two
practically related?

21:49.464 --> 21:52.664
- Woah!
- Woah!

21:52.777 --> 21:55.032
Yo, the girl that your in love with

21:55.450 --> 21:58.119
happens just to be your cousin,

21:58.327 --> 22:01.412
Oh, doesn't that hurt
a little buzzing...

22:01.622 --> 22:04.539
Going around in your
little wedgie stomach.

22:04.750 --> 22:08.368
I can't believe your feelings
just took a plummet.

22:12.382 --> 22:15.217
I can't rap, man, but
I'm doing it for you!

22:15.760 --> 22:17.041
It's right there.

22:17.262 --> 22:19.931
- Wow!
- Oooohhh!

22:23.726 --> 22:27.510
Damn! Your future wife is loaded!

22:29.189 --> 22:34.184
You guys stay here. I'll handle this.

22:35.695 --> 22:37.355
Heads up, Vic!

22:38.490 --> 22:41.490
- Hi, Victor!
- Hey there, Anya.

22:42.619 --> 22:44.278
So, how about that?

22:44.495 --> 22:47.069
- It's almost Wednesday, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

22:47.290 --> 22:48.748
You live around here?

22:48.958 --> 22:53.370
Uh, yeah, yeah. Um... no.

22:53.796 --> 22:56.915
- Here, ah, let me get those.
- Thanks.

22:57.132 --> 22:59.623
So, ah, what's up with all the cans?

22:59.843 --> 23:01.218
Huh?

23:03.013 --> 23:04.127
Hi Anya!

23:04.347 --> 23:09.092
Well, we're turning great profits
from the party by selling them.

23:10.102 --> 23:11.347
I didn't know you were
such a business man.

23:11.562 --> 23:13.270
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:13.481 --> 23:17.063
You know, me and old Billy Gates, ha.

23:17.609 --> 23:18.854
Let the profits go to charity.

23:19.319 --> 23:23.233
China, Af-Africa, Ca-California...

23:26.326 --> 23:30.952
- So, it's almost Wednesday, huh?
- You said that already.

23:31.164 --> 23:34.248
I did, I did, yeah.
That must make it a fact then.

23:35.459 --> 23:39.042
Look, I came to tell you, um...
I wanted to ask you...

23:43.467 --> 23:44.987
You know my little
brother Zack, right?

23:45.135 --> 23:47.708
He's friends with your little
brother. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.

23:48.638 --> 23:50.796
So Zack's your little brother.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.807
Is that a good thing, or?

23:54.394 --> 23:59.600
Yeah, yeah, he is. Good old Zackie,
he's a real... bro.

24:00.024 --> 24:01.815
Victor, is everything alright?

24:02.026 --> 24:08.110
Hell, no. Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
everything's just... dandy.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.569
- Well, I gotta get going.
- Are you going to Peter's? Or...

24:12.952 --> 24:17.910
No, I actually have
an interview at USC.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.375
I'm really nervous.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.626
Do, do I look alright?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.502
You look... beautiful.

24:32.846 --> 24:36.096
Cool. I, I mean, thank you.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.724
I'll see you later, Victor.

24:49.945 --> 24:53.989
Oh, and I really don't want you to
sleep with Peter on Wednesday.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.109
Come...

24:57.786 --> 24:58.786
I don't...

25:01.289 --> 25:02.289
Come on, what?

25:07.795 --> 25:10.547
It's a great opening.
We need to make it juicier, though.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.215
Not to worry. That's under control.

25:13.801 --> 25:16.718
Victor's going to a party on Saturday.

25:16.928 --> 25:19.087
Anya would be delighted to see Victor,

25:19.306 --> 25:22.010
Saturday, September 10th at 3 PM,

25:22.225 --> 25:26.223
for her 18th birthday celebration.
3 PM.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.477
That's an hour after all
the grown-ups arrive.

25:28.689 --> 25:30.682
I like where your head's at.

25:32.943 --> 25:33.943
One question gentlemen.

25:34.069 --> 25:38.114
The invasion of Normandy is what?

25:38.323 --> 25:40.280
Took place when? Lead by whom?

25:40.492 --> 25:44.240
Sorry, Mein Fräulein, that's
three questions, not one.

25:45.789 --> 25:49.323
D-day, 6th of June 1944.

25:49.542 --> 25:50.953
General Eisenhower.

25:51.169 --> 25:53.624
Damn, you ought to teach that shit!

25:53.838 --> 25:58.215
Yes. And you ought to get down
to the principal's office. Now!

25:58.425 --> 26:01.711
- Herut!
- Ooo!

26:05.932 --> 26:07.095
It's only an overnight trip, right?

26:07.309 --> 26:08.469
Yeah. So, I'm not gonna pass.

26:08.518 --> 26:12.101
- So it's Wednesday.
- Yeah.

26:14.232 --> 26:15.642
I can't believe that.

26:15.858 --> 26:16.889
Yeah in Study Hall.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.029
I'm sorry we can't
help you out tonight.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.947
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:25.701 --> 26:27.029
Ernie...

26:28.286 --> 26:31.073
Sorry, we gotta bounce.

26:31.831 --> 26:33.824
The Lakers await us.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.669
You gonna be okay.

26:41.257 --> 26:43.498
Good luck, Vic.

26:52.225 --> 26:56.353
This Napa Pinot
is elegantly smooth,

26:56.563 --> 26:59.398
full bodied, with a hint of blueberry.

27:00.691 --> 27:03.692
And it has an exquisite nose.

27:09.533 --> 27:10.533
Cheers, darling.

27:11.201 --> 27:12.779
Cheers.

27:22.754 --> 27:25.209
I think it tastes a little stale.

27:25.423 --> 27:27.083
Stale?

27:28.759 --> 27:31.630
- I'll give you stale! Huh?
- What? Nooo! Nooo!

27:31.845 --> 27:32.845
Huh? Huh?

27:32.888 --> 27:34.596
What? Huh?

27:34.806 --> 27:36.716
Seriously! Stop!

27:51.697 --> 27:52.697
Your turn.

27:53.365 --> 27:57.279
- I'm actually a little cold.
- I'll keep you warm.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.755
What the hell?

28:12.675 --> 28:14.169
We'll pretend like no one's home.

28:14.385 --> 28:17.006
Oh, no, no, no, let me just
go check it out really quick.

28:24.728 --> 28:25.890
Hi, Anya.

28:26.646 --> 28:29.481
Hey, what are you doing here?

28:29.691 --> 28:33.819
Well, call me a mama's boy, but I
promised I would pick up Zack.

28:34.028 --> 28:37.278
He's not here.
Brian's with my parents playing Bridge.

28:38.199 --> 28:41.034
Really? You sure you don't have
him hiding in here somewhere?

28:42.828 --> 28:45.829
What the hell is hiccups doing here?

28:46.039 --> 28:48.708
Ah, I just swung by to
pick up my kid brother.

28:48.917 --> 28:51.324
But apparently he's not here.

28:51.544 --> 28:53.501
Why in the world would
your brother be here?

28:53.713 --> 28:54.876
He's friends with Brian.

28:55.089 --> 28:56.418
Exactly.

28:57.383 --> 29:00.170
Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing anything?

29:01.095 --> 29:04.179
Not anything we can't get back to.

29:05.307 --> 29:08.391
- Well, I guess you better be going.
- Peter, don't be rude!

29:08.602 --> 29:11.686
No, I'll, I'll leave
you two to do it...

29:12.772 --> 29:14.101
to it!

29:15.108 --> 29:16.685
See you later, Victor.

29:16.901 --> 29:18.645
Time for bed.
Kindergarten starts early.

29:18.861 --> 29:21.150
What? Huh...

29:27.578 --> 29:32.038
Okay. Where were we? Oh, yeah.

29:42.091 --> 29:46.919
Yeah, right there. Right there.
Yeah! You feel that? It's pectorals.

29:56.438 --> 29:58.976
Feel those pectorals, baby?
It's muscle.

30:00.317 --> 30:03.068
- What the hell is this?
- I guess tonight isn't our night.

30:04.821 --> 30:06.730
No shit, Sherlock!

30:14.121 --> 30:14.821
Victor?!

30:15.039 --> 30:19.617
I'm really sorry to bother you,
but I can't find my wallet.

30:19.835 --> 30:22.207
So I was trying to back track
my night, and I thought,

30:22.420 --> 30:26.632
well, I couldn't possibly
have left it here, could I?

30:26.841 --> 30:29.130
Unless you threw the thing through
the door when we weren't looking!

30:29.343 --> 30:31.087
You, you didn't come in really.

30:32.013 --> 30:34.301
That's true.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.895
Is there something going on
that I don't know about?

30:42.105 --> 30:43.730
Do you drop by several
times every night?

30:43.940 --> 30:46.265
- No.
- Of course not.

30:46.860 --> 30:48.620
Are you trying to cock
block me or something?

30:48.736 --> 30:50.943
Look, I,
I hope you find your wallet.

30:51.155 --> 30:52.234
Thanks.

30:52.448 --> 30:54.322
Let's see, your little
brother, your wallet,

30:54.534 --> 30:56.573
Is there anything else
you want us to check for?

30:58.829 --> 31:00.786
Nope. I think that's about it.

31:00.998 --> 31:02.456
Great!

31:05.961 --> 31:06.961
You alright?

31:07.087 --> 31:08.285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:08.505 --> 31:12.882
I'm fine, I'm fine...
Unless it wouldn't be too much trouble...

31:13.509 --> 31:15.751
Could I get a glass of milk?

31:17.930 --> 31:21.264
Whole milk. My personal favorite.

31:21.475 --> 31:26.018
Lots of energy. Tasty, yet...

31:26.271 --> 31:28.228
Whole.

31:43.287 --> 31:44.485
More?

31:44.705 --> 31:48.074
Ah, what the hell.
The night's still young. Fill me up.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.935
Well, thanks for the drink.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.894
You sure you don't want more?

32:18.111 --> 32:20.566
They say to drink a full gallon
when you're still growing.

32:20.780 --> 32:24.398
Naa, I shouldn't. Biking.

32:25.952 --> 32:28.028
I'll put this bad boy in the dishwasher.
Make myself useful.

32:28.245 --> 32:30.368
- No, that's not necessary, Victor.
- I got it.

32:35.127 --> 32:38.792
- Where do the dishes go?
- I'll take care of it! Useless!

32:39.423 --> 32:41.332
Guess I better be going!

32:42.217 --> 32:45.134
Thanks for stopping by, and if you
need a bedtime story or get hungry...

32:45.970 --> 32:48.591
- Do it at home. Okay?!
- Okay.

32:48.806 --> 32:51.095
- See you later.
- Much, much later!

32:51.934 --> 32:53.808
Jesus, God!

32:55.145 --> 32:57.553
I don't believe that kid!

32:57.773 --> 33:01.224
I bet you in five minutes he'll want
to borrow 3 eggs for a cup cake.

33:01.443 --> 33:03.151
Oh, he's not that bad.

33:03.361 --> 33:04.361
"What's up, ladies?

33:04.487 --> 33:07.607
My name is Victor. I'm a mama's boy
picking up my little brother!"

33:08.867 --> 33:11.737
I think he's sweet,
in his own dorky way.

33:11.953 --> 33:15.037
Sweet? Oh. I'll show you sweet.

33:25.424 --> 33:27.630
I only play to win, Roger.

33:28.677 --> 33:32.544
All I'm saying is, if I
open with two diamonds...

33:32.764 --> 33:36.298
It isn't particularly intelligent
of you to call "no trumps".

33:36.517 --> 33:39.352
I mean for God's sake,
there weren't any more spades!

33:39.562 --> 33:40.890
It's called bluffing, my darling.

33:41.105 --> 33:43.181
You saw it for yourself, they
had no idea what I was doing.

33:43.399 --> 33:44.399
Well, neither did I!

33:44.525 --> 33:46.683
They're probably perking
like pigs right now.

33:46.902 --> 33:49.060
Watch your language, young man!

33:55.243 --> 33:58.362
You know, maybe we should
ring the bell, just in case.

33:58.579 --> 34:01.284
We are the ones who
live here, are we not?

34:01.499 --> 34:03.819
Yeah, remember when your mother
and father walked in on us?

34:03.959 --> 34:06.248
We were on the kitchen counter...

34:07.838 --> 34:09.545
I'm gonna ring. I'm gonna ring.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.543
That's it, you cock
blocking son of a bitch!

34:15.762 --> 34:18.549
No more Anya to stand
between you and my fist!

34:18.764 --> 34:22.928
Why don't you fuck off so
I can finally fuck her!!!

34:27.106 --> 34:29.643
Mr. and Mrs. Benton. Hi.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.607
We were just doing some homework.

34:33.820 --> 34:35.813
Drama.

34:39.284 --> 34:42.119
You wanna put your shirt on?

34:43.329 --> 34:44.329
How was Bridge?

34:44.539 --> 34:48.286
You're right.
Peter's facial expression is priceless!

34:49.376 --> 34:52.745
I know, the sunglass cam was
definitely a good investment.

34:52.963 --> 34:55.283
Especially with the stuff of
my dad cheating in Bridge too.

34:55.465 --> 34:58.170
Yeah, that will make us
a nice blackmail payoff.

34:58.385 --> 35:00.461
So, what do you think
we'll make on this film?

35:00.679 --> 35:02.718
A couple hundred million at least.

35:02.931 --> 35:05.766
That's what those French folks got
from the animal video on YouPorn.

35:05.975 --> 35:08.548
Oh, the one with the porcupine
and the giraffe screwing?

35:08.769 --> 35:12.601
Dude! And those are mammals.
We're getting people!

35:12.815 --> 35:16.397
- People are mammals, stupid.
- Whatever.

35:30.289 --> 35:32.531
Benton residence, talk to me, bitch.

35:33.501 --> 35:36.537
Hi. It's Victor. Is Anya there?

35:36.754 --> 35:38.960
It's Victor. He's actually buying it.

35:40.174 --> 35:42.499
Well, she's out taking a dump.

35:44.553 --> 35:46.213
Are you coming to her birthday party?

35:46.429 --> 35:48.505
I know she really wants to see you.

35:48.723 --> 35:51.641
Really? Yeah, I'd love to come.

35:51.851 --> 35:54.057
Do you know what kind of
present she would like?

35:54.937 --> 35:57.137
The idiot wants to know what
she wants for her birthday!

36:06.740 --> 36:09.990
Well Vic, if you really wanna
make my sister happy,

36:10.202 --> 36:12.194
you'll buy her a tarantula.

36:12.412 --> 36:14.950
She's wanted one of those
things since she was little.

36:18.126 --> 36:20.877
A tarantula? Really?

36:21.087 --> 36:22.462
Hell, yeah.

36:22.671 --> 36:25.341
She's always dreamt of having a
wrestling match between her lizard

36:25.633 --> 36:27.590
and one of them black, hairy beasts.

36:27.801 --> 36:31.501
I didn't even know she had a lizard.

36:31.721 --> 36:33.631
Alright. Thanks for the tip.

36:38.811 --> 36:40.555
Are you sure you guys are related?

36:40.772 --> 36:43.808
I know! How can anyone be that thick?

36:46.402 --> 36:50.779
It balances the color.
That's what you gotta do, honey.

36:51.323 --> 36:52.354
Hey!

36:53.158 --> 36:54.438
Do you guys happen to know

36:54.659 --> 36:58.159
if tarantulas are like,
really deadly poisonous?

36:58.371 --> 37:01.325
- Why, did you see one?!
- No. No, I was just curious.

37:02.417 --> 37:05.168
They are one of the most dangerous
of all spiders, Victor.

37:05.378 --> 37:07.619
- If you see one, do not touch it!
- No.

37:08.964 --> 37:12.333
- What's in the bag, son?
- Just some homework.

37:12.551 --> 37:13.551
Wow!

37:13.594 --> 37:16.001
- He's so cool. Let's keep him!
- We can't keep him.

37:16.221 --> 37:19.257
Mom will go ballistic if she found
out we had a tarantula in the house.

37:19.474 --> 37:22.226
Besides, it's a present for Anya.

37:24.729 --> 37:27.302
- Let's name him Hugo.
- Don't piss him off.

37:27.523 --> 37:31.141
- Let's find a dog and feed it.
- They don't eat dogs, you idiot!

37:31.360 --> 37:35.571
The big ones do. The Turners down
the street, they own a Chihuahua.

37:35.781 --> 37:37.987
- Zack, where are you?
- Mom! Mom! Get the door!

37:42.037 --> 37:43.235
Zack!

37:47.083 --> 37:49.122
Zachary James!

37:49.335 --> 37:50.335
What the hell?

37:51.546 --> 37:54.333
I guess he's stronger than we thought.
And hungrier...

37:54.548 --> 37:57.585
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.
We have to find him now!

37:58.427 --> 37:59.755
Where are you?

38:01.263 --> 38:02.294
Zach!

38:03.265 --> 38:04.510
Arrrhhhh.

38:05.642 --> 38:06.642
You're such a wimp.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.411
Whatever you're doing,
young man, don't!

38:08.561 --> 38:09.676
Zach!

38:09.896 --> 38:12.102
Get up! Get up! Get up!

38:13.566 --> 38:15.190
- Oh, you're in here.
- Hi, Mom.

38:15.401 --> 38:19.233
- How are you today?
- Zachary, what did you do this time?

38:20.197 --> 38:24.491
Nothing at all, Mom.
I'm just helping Victor with his homework.

38:24.701 --> 38:27.536
You know, WWII and stuff.
Great war.

38:28.914 --> 38:30.705
Is something wrong, Victor?

38:30.915 --> 38:32.196
You look a little worried.

38:32.417 --> 38:36.580
Ah, no, no, no, I just,
have a stomach ache.

38:36.796 --> 38:38.705
Does it hurt bad?
Do you want some yogurt?

38:38.923 --> 38:41.563
- Oh, I'm alright. It'll pass.
- We ate three packs of cream puffs.

38:41.759 --> 38:43.383
Well, no wonder!

38:43.594 --> 38:46.464
You have to eat something
more substantial.

38:46.680 --> 38:50.049
That's what I kept telling Vic
here, but he kept insisting.

38:50.267 --> 38:54.050
I love cream puffs. What time is it?

38:54.270 --> 38:57.971
Oh, my God, it's already 5.30.

38:58.191 --> 39:01.891
I'm gonna start dinner shortly.
You boys better be able to eat something.

39:02.111 --> 39:03.985
We will.

39:05.823 --> 39:11.113
And it was freezing
cold in Stalingrad.

39:11.328 --> 39:13.783
The soldiers had bare feet...

39:13.997 --> 39:17.200
as they walked... where?

39:17.417 --> 39:19.623
That's question number 8.

39:20.628 --> 39:23.499
It'll make an awesome scene
when he gives it to her.

39:23.714 --> 39:25.956
Word. Hopefully she'll
punch him or something.

39:27.093 --> 39:28.291
Hey! That's mine!

39:28.511 --> 39:30.669
No one get's away with
cheating in my class!

39:30.888 --> 39:32.888
You can collect it later
at the principal's office.

39:33.098 --> 39:35.636
Out! Both of you! Auf wiedersehen!

39:35.851 --> 39:40.845
- Come on Zack, we're out.
- Yeah, this place is dead anyway.

39:42.649 --> 39:44.522
Question number 9!

39:50.281 --> 39:51.281
Ah.

39:52.199 --> 39:53.574
Are you feeling alright, Victor?

39:54.493 --> 39:58.360
Yeah, Mom.
I'm just going to a birthday party.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.407
At a girl's house.

40:00.624 --> 40:02.367
At a girl's house?

40:02.584 --> 40:06.416
A girl named Anya.

40:07.964 --> 40:10.087
Oh, my, my, what did you get her?

40:10.299 --> 40:12.173
Uh. It, it, it's a, it's a book.

40:12.385 --> 40:16.548
- Oh, it's a big book, isn't it?
- Yeah, she reads a bunch.

40:16.764 --> 40:19.599
Anya. Do you take classes together?

40:20.851 --> 40:23.805
No, uh, she's... she's a Senior.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.680
I don't really like
the girls my own age.

40:27.899 --> 40:30.853
Wow! That's amazing!

40:34.614 --> 40:35.942
Let me.

40:41.662 --> 40:44.413
You should invite her over for
dinner, so Dad and I could meet her.

40:44.623 --> 40:49.450
Uh, I don't think so.
We're just friends, ya know...

40:50.420 --> 40:53.255
Is that why you're
ironing your underpants?

40:55.717 --> 40:59.381
Sorry. So, what does
this Anya look like?

40:59.595 --> 41:03.972
She's... she's got dark hair and,

41:04.183 --> 41:07.598
she's so...

41:09.062 --> 41:10.604
She needs to be seen.

41:12.983 --> 41:15.556
Well, there you go.

41:16.528 --> 41:17.607
The socks...

41:18.654 --> 41:20.730
I'll let you do yourself.

41:20.948 --> 41:22.063
Who is getting married?

41:22.283 --> 41:26.530
He's going to a birthday party.
For a girl...

41:26.745 --> 41:28.156
who's a Senior!

41:28.372 --> 41:30.115
So he's not gay, huh?

41:31.583 --> 41:33.872
- I, I got it.
- Well, let me just get the other.

41:34.085 --> 41:37.335
No, I'm gonna leave them down. Mom!

41:57.023 --> 41:59.894
Please! Come on!

42:01.820 --> 42:03.563
Please, stop!

42:08.117 --> 42:09.777
So Victor, how does it feel

42:09.994 --> 42:12.449
visiting the girl you've had wet
dreams about on her birthday?

42:13.956 --> 42:14.956
Are you nervous?

42:15.124 --> 42:17.793
Brian Henry!
Go back in the living room.

42:18.001 --> 42:19.994
We're not buying anything today.

42:20.212 --> 42:23.995
Mom! This is Victor.
Anya's new boy toy.

42:26.634 --> 42:28.093
Really?

42:28.302 --> 42:31.220
Hi, Mrs. Benton. Victor Knudsen.
Very nice to meet you.

42:31.430 --> 42:34.182
I thought everyone was here.

42:34.391 --> 42:36.099
Victor?

42:38.103 --> 42:40.890
Happy Birthday.
Thanks for inviting me.

42:41.815 --> 42:44.057
You're welcome.

42:46.444 --> 42:49.647
What a lovely present you brought
for my daughter, Victor.

42:51.074 --> 42:52.865
Thanks.

42:53.075 --> 42:57.203
So, Anya, are you as excited as me
to see what's inside that thing?

43:13.886 --> 43:15.760
What the hell is nerd boy doing here?

43:18.641 --> 43:21.132
Why doesn't she just kick him out?
He clearly doesn't belong.

43:21.352 --> 43:24.685
She can't kick him out. He dressed
up and brought a present and all.

43:26.315 --> 43:28.984
Well, come on already,
Anya, open it.

43:33.696 --> 43:36.567
Slower, Sis. With feeling.

43:49.169 --> 43:53.083
Oh, look at that, there's
something moving in there.

43:53.298 --> 43:54.496
It's a....

44:00.430 --> 44:03.383
Oh, wow!
It's an Eximius Colosus Aranea!!

44:05.101 --> 44:06.511
Oh, my God!

44:06.727 --> 44:09.407
Oh, Victor, that big, hairy fella
must have cost you a fortune, huh?

44:09.521 --> 44:11.063
His name's Hugo.

44:11.273 --> 44:14.973
- Does it attack humans?
- Only when it feels threatened.

44:19.239 --> 44:22.156
But, it was to keep
your lizard company.

44:22.367 --> 44:24.193
I don't own any lizards, Victor.

44:24.410 --> 44:25.410
You don't?

44:30.291 --> 44:33.375
No, no, no, just keep breathing.
It's okay, now he's just,

44:33.585 --> 44:36.705
you know, just keep breathing.
Take a deep breath.

44:36.922 --> 44:38.665
It's in the box, it's
not gonna harm anyone.

44:38.882 --> 44:40.341
It's not funny.

44:40.800 --> 44:45.047
Let me get you a piece of
cake to calm your nerves.

44:47.015 --> 44:48.425
Honey, it's okay.

44:49.851 --> 44:51.131
Thank you.

44:51.352 --> 44:53.261
Ooooohhh!

45:07.659 --> 45:09.532
Anya, I'm so sorry about all this.

45:09.744 --> 45:11.072
I'm sure you didn't intend

45:11.287 --> 45:14.323
on releasing a poisonous
creature in my house on purpose.

45:15.833 --> 45:18.584
Thanks for hiding me in your bedroom.

45:18.794 --> 45:21.367
Your entire family probably
wants to kill me, huh?

45:21.588 --> 45:24.957
For some reason my dad finds
you really hilarious.

45:25.842 --> 45:27.634
He seems like a great guy.

45:28.887 --> 45:33.465
I thought it was very sweet of you
to buy me such a lovely present.

45:33.683 --> 45:34.845
I'm glad you liked it.

45:35.059 --> 45:37.846
What on earth made you
buy me a tarantula?

45:39.146 --> 45:40.771
Brian said you always wanted one!

45:42.191 --> 45:45.310
That little turd had
something to do with this.

45:53.368 --> 45:55.325
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

45:56.204 --> 45:58.030
Not at all.

46:00.041 --> 46:03.955
- Never give up, huh?
- I guess not.

46:06.964 --> 46:10.498
Well, I guess I better kiss you, then.

46:15.472 --> 46:18.342
Well, we still can't find Hugo.
But the good news is,

46:18.558 --> 46:20.100
Aunt Lizzy didn't get bit after all.

46:20.309 --> 46:23.559
It was just her recent Botox
that made her face go numb.

46:23.771 --> 46:25.680
I hope I didn't ruin your couch.

46:26.982 --> 46:28.607
Hum. 22 grand.

46:28.817 --> 46:31.189
22,000 dollars?!

46:31.403 --> 46:33.028
No, I'm just messing with you, kid.

46:35.907 --> 46:37.188
You need a ride home?

46:37.409 --> 46:40.279
Yeah. Thanks.

46:44.207 --> 46:45.950
Sorry again I ruined your birthday.

46:59.429 --> 47:03.094
It's a, it's a really great motor.
You can't wear the crankshaft out.

47:03.308 --> 47:05.977
The pistons are cast
steel, and the brakes...

47:06.185 --> 47:08.012
work every other Tuesday.

47:09.188 --> 47:12.806
Since I don't have no Senior babe,
I have to drill what I got.

47:14.026 --> 47:15.769
Even if it was just a mercy kiss,

47:15.986 --> 47:18.821
I think I'll see if she wants
to go to a movie sometime.

47:19.031 --> 47:20.822
Woa, woa, woa, woa, woa.

47:21.033 --> 47:23.358
No, no.

47:23.577 --> 47:27.076
You can't take a girl you really
like to the movies on a first date.

47:27.288 --> 47:30.871
You have to do something
that will really impress her.

47:31.084 --> 47:33.574
Yeah. Something to get her panties wet.

47:35.337 --> 47:39.714
Imagine you and her alone together...

47:41.969 --> 47:43.926
Close those eyes.

47:44.137 --> 47:48.598
Somewhere romantic.
Somewhere that' II make her heart go

47:48.808 --> 47:53.351
"Victor, Victor, Victor."

47:54.105 --> 47:56.263
Where would you be?

47:58.526 --> 48:01.063
I got it! I'll take her
to Pyramid Lake and,

48:01.278 --> 48:03.105
and get some bananas, organic ones.

48:03.322 --> 48:05.943
Girls like that. And rent a row boat.

48:06.158 --> 48:07.616
Thanks boys, wish me luck!

48:10.870 --> 48:14.820
Bananas? I think we got a situation.

48:16.626 --> 48:18.702
I'm more worried about the row boat.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.161
He doesn't really have the
arms for it, you know?

48:21.380 --> 48:23.622
- Truth.
- Got the legs, though.

48:41.190 --> 48:42.981
Hey Victor. What's up?

48:45.319 --> 48:48.486
I uh... wanted to make it up to you.

48:49.448 --> 48:51.524
For the mess I made.

48:53.952 --> 48:55.991
Give me five minutes.

49:07.048 --> 49:12.386
So, where's this apology at?

49:16.848 --> 49:17.963
Thanks.

49:18.183 --> 49:23.260
I was also hoping you'd
come with me somewhere?

49:23.480 --> 49:25.187
For lunch.

49:25.648 --> 49:28.353
Nowhere near poisonous creatures,
I promise.

49:30.361 --> 49:33.564
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:43.248 --> 49:45.703
Sorry, it's my dad's.

49:45.917 --> 49:48.242
- No Lotus.
- It has character.

49:50.004 --> 49:51.747
Anya, what the hell you doing, baby?

49:52.673 --> 49:54.251
Shit.

49:54.467 --> 49:57.882
Victor's taking me out to
apologize for my birthday party.

49:58.095 --> 50:01.594
But, I was planning to take you
to the Four Seasons today.

50:01.807 --> 50:03.764
I booked a room... ahhh, a table.

50:04.518 --> 50:05.518
Sorry.

50:05.727 --> 50:10.139
Anya, come on, it's Victor, the
hiccup Freshman, for Christ sake.

50:11.399 --> 50:14.353
Are you seriously choosing to go
out with some 15 year old loser

50:14.569 --> 50:17.818
who's so not in your league, over moi?

50:18.030 --> 50:21.031
You can be such a
jackass, you know that?

50:23.660 --> 50:25.819
- Let's go, Victor.
- Yeah.

50:32.877 --> 50:36.412
If I hadn't just had a manicure
you'd be dead meat, hiccup boy!

50:36.631 --> 50:40.082
Fine. I hope you two are very
happy together, in your...

50:40.301 --> 50:44.429
1915 get-out-and-push
piece of shit wheels.

50:45.556 --> 50:47.513
Have fun at Dave and Buster's.

50:52.687 --> 50:56.519
- So, that went well.
- Yeah, I guess that was that.

51:08.160 --> 51:09.868
I, I...

51:15.500 --> 51:17.540
Try it now.

51:23.508 --> 51:24.752
Wow!

51:34.393 --> 51:37.393
Um. The Queen Nefertiti Rose.

51:38.146 --> 51:41.266
Named after the Roman Queen.

51:43.735 --> 51:47.566
Your pink-white, and your
white, and your white pink...

51:49.448 --> 51:52.734
- So, where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

52:05.630 --> 52:10.292
- Hi, we'd like to ah....
- Mr. Victor Knudsen, I presume?

52:10.510 --> 52:13.594
- Yeah...
- Everything is ready, sir.

52:13.804 --> 52:16.888
- Just like you requested.
- Requested?

52:18.308 --> 52:23.551
Oh, Victor, it's absolutely amazing!
How romantic!

52:25.357 --> 52:28.939
- Yeah, well...
- I wanna row!

52:29.903 --> 52:32.939
I'm glad everything is to
the young lady's liking.

52:37.868 --> 52:41.652
The rest is in your hands.

52:50.255 --> 52:54.584
Come on, let's follow 'em.
Maybe we'll get to see some live porn.

52:54.801 --> 53:00.043
No man, he's on his own now.
It's so romantic.

53:00.389 --> 53:03.722
Oh, it's so romantic, boo-boo.

53:03.934 --> 53:06.259
You know what's, what's romantic here?

53:06.478 --> 53:08.886
I like cheese fries.
I want some cheese fries.

53:09.106 --> 53:10.226
Let's get some cheese fries.

53:10.273 --> 53:13.274
Really? Cheese fries are fat.

53:23.411 --> 53:26.328
My family and I used to
come here when I was a kid.

53:27.331 --> 53:31.624
It's gorgeous.
I never knew this place existed.

54:07.618 --> 54:10.702
I'm sorry for what Peter said earlier.

54:11.288 --> 54:14.538
It's okay. He's right.
It's a piece of shit car.

54:15.375 --> 54:18.958
No, I mean; you're not a loser.

54:20.213 --> 54:22.621
And I'm not out of your league.

54:25.009 --> 54:26.009
You're not?

54:45.028 --> 54:47.317
I just wanted to make
sure that's clear.

54:59.667 --> 55:01.374
Victor?

55:02.127 --> 55:04.535
Have you ever done it?

55:04.755 --> 55:06.035
Done what?

55:07.465 --> 55:10.502
You know... "it"?

55:12.053 --> 55:16.347
Oh, oh, it! Yeah, sure, of course.

55:16.557 --> 55:19.130
All the time. Who hasn't?

55:25.190 --> 55:26.388
No.

55:30.320 --> 55:33.985
Do you.... maybe want to?

55:37.118 --> 55:38.529
With me?

55:39.453 --> 55:40.948
Here?

55:41.163 --> 55:45.492
No, silly.
My parents play cards on Wednesdays.

55:46.502 --> 55:48.293
Oh, I know.

55:48.504 --> 55:50.295
You do?

55:51.965 --> 55:54.004
You could come by around 8.

55:55.218 --> 55:58.088
Eight? I can do 8, yeah!

55:59.013 --> 56:03.342
And bring something with you.
If you know what I mean.

56:05.686 --> 56:08.473
Right. Right. Something.

56:08.689 --> 56:10.563
Sure.

56:12.234 --> 56:15.021
I'm the king of the world!!

56:53.272 --> 56:56.688
Good day, young man, haven't seen
you before. How may I help you?

57:04.991 --> 57:07.233
My Miniature Pony?

57:09.412 --> 57:13.196
Yeah, it's for my little br... sister!

57:13.624 --> 57:15.664
Anything else I can get for you?

57:15.876 --> 57:18.747
Yeah, I, I really need some cond...

57:18.963 --> 57:20.872
Some, some cond...

57:21.423 --> 57:24.958
Some condensed milk.

57:25.177 --> 57:30.384
Condensed milk? Alright.

57:34.227 --> 57:38.354
- Is that all?
- No, no, I, I, I need some cond...

57:39.190 --> 57:42.060
- Some cond....
- Cond?

57:44.862 --> 57:48.230
Condoms...

57:51.368 --> 57:54.701
- I, I mean some rubb....
- Rub what?

57:55.580 --> 58:00.621
Some ru... bbing alcohol.
Rubbing alcohol.

58:01.377 --> 58:05.326
Hm hum. Yep, that, that's the stuff.

58:09.259 --> 58:12.213
And I really need some cond...

58:13.555 --> 58:18.263
Some co...
Ca, Ca, Castillo's, Cas, Castello's.

58:18.476 --> 58:19.476
Those.

58:19.519 --> 58:20.717
How old are you?

58:20.937 --> 58:22.929
Oh, no, I wouldn't touch those things.

58:23.147 --> 58:26.397
- They're for my dad.
- Ahh, someone's having a party.

58:34.157 --> 58:36.150
Yo, Victor. Whatcha doing?

58:41.497 --> 58:43.739
Didn't look like a Havana.

58:50.172 --> 58:52.129
You wanna make 5 bucks?

58:52.341 --> 58:55.045
Not really, but I
wouldn't mind making 20.

58:57.596 --> 58:59.635
And what may I get for you today, son?

58:59.848 --> 59:01.887
I'd like to buy some jimmy hats.

59:03.143 --> 59:05.930
I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the name.
What may they be?

59:06.145 --> 59:10.439
Dingers, johnnies, gloves.

59:10.650 --> 59:13.650
The thing you need when you're
banging a chick, of course.

59:13.861 --> 59:14.861
Oh, my!

59:15.070 --> 59:18.653
I suppose you mean condoms,
my young fellow?

59:18.865 --> 59:22.068
Duh, what are you deaf?
Rubbers with colors.

59:22.285 --> 59:26.034
And you don't suppose you're a bit
too young for that sort of thing?

59:26.247 --> 59:29.450
I don't think so mister, the fat
one's getting hairy already.

59:31.210 --> 59:32.870
I'm sorry, are you
feeling alright, ma'am?

59:33.087 --> 59:36.835
I just need to lean
up against something.

59:37.049 --> 59:39.421
Or should I rather
buy the ribbed ones?

59:39.635 --> 59:40.749
They're supposed to
prolong the pleasure.

59:40.969 --> 59:44.836
Listen, kid. We only have normal
kinds, no colors, knobs or flavors!

59:45.056 --> 59:48.508
Alright, I'll make do with the smooth ones.
A carton of Trojans.

59:48.727 --> 59:51.015
A carton? Are you completely
out of your mind, kid?

59:51.229 --> 59:52.343
There's 200 in a carton!!

59:52.563 --> 59:56.146
Yeah, I'm spending the
entire weekend with her,

59:56.359 --> 59:59.110
and she's a lush one so...

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.028
Alrighty then, give me two.

01:00:01.238 --> 01:00:04.192
- Two cartons?
- No, just two.

01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:06.281
I can always flip them over and reuse.

01:00:07.452 --> 01:00:10.572
- Four-fifty.
- Keep the change.

01:00:13.124 --> 01:00:15.330
You wouldn't happen to have
a dressing room out back,

01:00:15.543 --> 01:00:17.085
just so I can try them on for size?

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:18.872
Get out!

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.255
I can't believe my brother's
actually gonna get some.

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:27.296
It'll make great footage.

01:00:27.513 --> 01:00:31.130
It's gotta be possible to paint the
rain coats with luminous paint.

01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.508
So we can see the action in details.

01:00:33.727 --> 01:00:37.510
Not necessary, my man, this
baby's got night vision!

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:42.725
Nice. Not sure how well the film will
sell with a "happy ending" though.

01:00:42.944 --> 01:00:46.608
Yeah. Right now Victor's the
only one who'll get one.

01:00:46.822 --> 01:00:50.107
- We need more drama.
- Perhaps we can think of something.

01:00:50.909 --> 01:00:54.112
Would you mind sharing what
you just said with the class?

01:00:54.329 --> 01:00:56.618
Yeah, sure thing Mrs. T.

01:00:56.831 --> 01:00:59.583
It was about my gang bang with
three playmates last weekend.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:02.627
Alright!
That's quite enough sharing, Zack!

01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:05.754
Hey, you wanted to know.
I also showed the chicks my trapeze stunt.

01:01:05.965 --> 01:01:08.456
Principal's office!
Both of you! Now!

01:01:08.676 --> 01:01:12.673
Yeah, we gotta bounce anyway.
Our bitches are waiting.

01:01:14.223 --> 01:01:16.298
We out.

01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:33.357
Hello baby!! Your man is back!

01:01:36.201 --> 01:01:37.779
What did you smoke today?

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:41.114
Oh, good evening Mr. Benton, Sir.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:43.656
Call me Roger, Spider man.

01:01:44.793 --> 01:01:47.829
Did you bring us any other
dangerous animals this time?

01:01:48.046 --> 01:01:49.623
Not tonight, Mr. Benton.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.214
Oooh!

01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:52.424
Roger.

01:01:52.466 --> 01:01:57.211
Too bad. Still no Hugo.

01:01:59.264 --> 01:02:02.016
Come on, I'll take you
up to Anya's room.

01:02:02.934 --> 01:02:05.508
You two are working on a science
project for school tonight?

01:02:05.729 --> 01:02:09.097
Yeah. Yeah. For Science class.

01:02:09.315 --> 01:02:11.272
Okay.

01:02:27.457 --> 01:02:28.786
Hi!

01:02:29.459 --> 01:02:31.368
Hey.

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:43.045
I'm almost done.

01:03:05.993 --> 01:03:08.484
And... I'm done.

01:03:12.249 --> 01:03:17.456
So, aren't your parents
gonna play cards tonight?

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:19.081
I don't think so.

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:25.250
They actually asked if we
could watch Brian tonight.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:26.928
Hope that's okay with you.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:31.967
Sure. Sure, yeah, that's, that's fine.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.639
Gotcha! They leave in 10 minutes!

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.272
That is not even funny.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.143
- No.
- Okay.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.606
Stop!

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.365
Hey, there.

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:50.068
Just wanted to let you two
know that we're leaving.

01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:52.241
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:56.284
Get some work done.
We'll be back shortly.

01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.664
Have fun! Live free.

01:04:07.008 --> 01:04:08.008
So?

01:04:09.552 --> 01:04:10.715
So...

01:04:19.686 --> 01:04:22.853
You want a glass of milk?
To break the ice?

01:04:25.942 --> 01:04:27.520
Only if it's whole milk.

01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:03.141
Now that we've got
that taken care of....

01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:05.353
do you wanna go back to my room?

01:05:16.489 --> 01:05:18.612
Can you turn off the lights?

01:06:34.979 --> 01:06:37.896
Maybe it's a little too dark.

01:06:38.107 --> 01:06:40.348
No, it isn't, It's okay.

01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:53.529
Victor, what are you doing?

01:06:54.413 --> 01:06:58.078
- I'm touching you.
- No, no, no, you're not!

01:07:04.715 --> 01:07:09.625
- I thought it felt a little funny.
- Thanks for the compliment.

01:07:15.933 --> 01:07:19.717
Are you ready to get completely naked?

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:56.917
Victor, did you... bring something?

01:07:57.305 --> 01:07:58.680
Of course.

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:04.799
One second.

01:08:07.898 --> 01:08:09.309
Got it.

01:08:14.571 --> 01:08:15.571
One second.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.658
I can't get this piece of crap open.
Come...

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:29.577
Alright.

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:44.425
Is it on?

01:08:44.933 --> 01:08:48.551
- Yeah, on my fingers.
- Relax.

01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:51.058
It's my first time too, remember?

01:08:51.272 --> 01:08:54.937
<i>Yeah....</i>

01:08:55.317 --> 01:08:58.899
It was a lot easier putting it
on Ernie's fingers in Sex-Ed.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:01.938
How in the... hell?

01:09:06.536 --> 01:09:07.911
I have another one!

01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:09.152
Okay.

01:09:20.049 --> 01:09:22.883
Aren't we lucky, it has a manual.

01:09:23.801 --> 01:09:29.091
<i>"Roll slowly over erect penis".</i>

01:09:30.058 --> 01:09:31.801
How poetic.

01:09:32.143 --> 01:09:33.518
Let me try.

01:09:40.401 --> 01:09:44.529
"Erect penis".
That certainly isn't a problem.

01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:49.568
Abracadabra.

01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:53.321
Voilà!

01:10:01.253 --> 01:10:03.827
- My parents! Already?
- What?

01:10:09.845 --> 01:10:11.125
Victor, that's my dress!

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:20.640
The bed, the bed.
Help me, help me make the bed.

01:10:22.106 --> 01:10:26.020
I just don't think it's necessary!
She is 18 now, you know.

01:10:27.987 --> 01:10:30.477
Hey kids. We're back.

01:10:31.198 --> 01:10:32.198
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:35.023
So, have you two been,
uh, behaving yourselves?

01:10:35.243 --> 01:10:36.987
What do you think, Dad?

01:10:37.203 --> 01:10:40.204
Well, your father seems to believe
that you are a responsible adult.

01:10:41.624 --> 01:10:44.080
Victor, my man, did you
hit all the angles?

01:10:45.336 --> 01:10:47.245
Okay, come on, Brian, time for bed.

01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:53.465
Hey. That's a nice science
project there, guys. What is it?

01:10:54.553 --> 01:10:59.629
- It's a...
- Lexington Hussil.

01:10:59.849 --> 01:11:01.759
Hussil. A Lexington Hussil.

01:11:02.477 --> 01:11:04.516
Oh, I see.

01:11:04.854 --> 01:11:08.768
Victor, could I have a little
chat with you for a minute?

01:11:08.983 --> 01:11:10.062
In the kitchen.

01:11:10.818 --> 01:11:13.024
For Christ sakes, Dad, does
it have to be right now?

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:18.023
It's, it's fine. It's, it's fine.

01:11:18.492 --> 01:11:19.654
Victor!

01:11:19.868 --> 01:11:23.284
- Where did the other one go?
- I didn't have a chance to take it off!

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:28.417
Cheers.

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:34.963
One has to be careful not
to sit down on Hugo.

01:11:35.633 --> 01:11:38.586
Still haven't found that little bugger.

01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:46.016
You know, Victor, it's
become clear to me that

01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:50.804
my daughter likes you very
much and you like her, and

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:55.275
Constance and I think that you're
just ah, well, you know...

01:11:56.777 --> 01:11:59.861
In fact, you remind me very much
of myself when I was your age.

01:12:00.072 --> 01:12:02.361
Always going after the hot, older gal.

01:12:03.659 --> 01:12:08.616
So, I hope that the two of you,
you know, could be together for

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:12.875
- at least some time.
- So do I, sir.

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:16.709
Yeah. So, I understand that the two of
you wanna have sex with each other.

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:22.169
No. Hey, relax,

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:24.756
It's, you know it's completely natural.
Completely natural.

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:29.513
At your ages, you know. Even at
my age, I like to have it occasionally.

01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:32.050
Mostly with my wife.

01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:38.058
I'm in the cut-throat world
of advertising, alright?

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:39.649
It's kill or be killed.

01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:43.275
We're working on a big campaign now,
spending millions of dollars in fact,

01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:47.271
to get young people to understand
that protection can be "hip".

01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:50.243
And that it's important for them
to have a condom on them

01:12:50.452 --> 01:12:52.610
every time they leave their home.

01:12:52.829 --> 01:12:55.320
Well, I don't mean on them, of course.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.497
- No.
- But with them.

01:12:58.334 --> 01:13:00.244
You know, in their wallet,
or their pocket...

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:04.790
It doesn't matter where, as long
as they have the darn thing.

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.133
So, can I ask you a personal question?

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.092
Of course. Yeah.

01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:18.760
How often do you have a rubber on you?

01:13:21.648 --> 01:13:25.645
Well I, I, I just started having one....

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.149
on me, recently.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:32.441
You know, everyone's so liberated
now that it's important to have one...

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.532
on you, with you.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:38.703
Oh, I'm glad to hear that, Victor.
You know, you're adults now,

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.239
and that comes with
some responsibilities.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.656
Of course.

01:13:43.626 --> 01:13:46.580
I'm glad you have such a
good head for these things.

01:13:50.842 --> 01:13:55.171
- Want another drink for the road?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:17.566
Well, I'm glad we had this talk son.

01:14:21.495 --> 01:14:23.238
Me too, sir.

01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:25.831
Ow, alright.

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:29.747
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

01:14:33.464 --> 01:14:36.880
- Sorry about my dad.
<i>- It's all good.</i>

01:14:37.677 --> 01:14:40.298
Your dad and I understand each other.

01:14:42.389 --> 01:14:46.469
So, do you wanna do something
after school tomorrow?

01:14:47.519 --> 01:14:49.559
I actually have to
hang out with Marisa.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.603
Oh. Alright.

01:14:52.816 --> 01:14:56.019
- You should come.
<i>- With Marissa?!</i>

01:14:56.236 --> 01:14:59.770
You'll grow on her. Like a cactus.

01:15:02.867 --> 01:15:04.065
Good night, Victor.

01:15:04.285 --> 01:15:06.657
Sweet dreams.

01:15:23.136 --> 01:15:26.172
<i>- Whatup?</i>
- I think I have an idea for our ending.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:27.551
Nice...

01:15:34.354 --> 01:15:36.892
How the hell does
he forget to take it off?

01:15:37.107 --> 01:15:39.183
I don't know, we both
completely panicked.

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:42.900
You'll never get your cherry popped
if you keep hanging with that kid!

01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:47.110
I don't know about that.
It was pretty damn close.

01:15:47.325 --> 01:15:49.151
Besides I really like him.

01:15:49.368 --> 01:15:52.654
I mean he's, he's sweet,
and sincere, and...

01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:54.247
Victor!

01:15:54.456 --> 01:15:58.667
Baby, Oh, I missed you so much.
Why haven't you called me back?

01:15:58.877 --> 01:16:00.336
Are you still dating that old hag?

01:16:05.842 --> 01:16:07.669
Victor, what the hell are you doing?!

01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:11.840
I... I don't, I don't know! Who are you?

01:16:12.056 --> 01:16:15.472
Good one. I'll see you tomorrow, stud.

01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:19.182
Anya, I don't know what's going on.

01:16:19.396 --> 01:16:21.305
Well, I do!
What, you just wanted to show off

01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:23.603
in front of your stupid
Freshmen friends, didn't you?

01:16:23.775 --> 01:16:26.776
- No, I, I would never...
- Was I some sort of bet or something?

01:16:26.986 --> 01:16:27.484
Not at all!

01:16:27.695 --> 01:16:30.269
Since you didn't "get any" last night,
you're done with me, is that it?

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:33.360
- Would you listen to me?
- Don't touch me!

01:16:37.037 --> 01:16:37.702
Anya!

01:16:37.913 --> 01:16:40.784
- Leave me alone!
- You, bastard!

01:16:47.255 --> 01:16:49.960
But... I love you.

01:17:00.476 --> 01:17:03.927
- Oh, that looks great!
- Well, they travel, you know.

01:17:04.146 --> 01:17:07.100
Look. He's a little fat, but
you know, for what this has...

01:17:09.067 --> 01:17:10.442
Victor, are you alright?

01:17:10.652 --> 01:17:14.317
- You look terrible.
- Honey, what's wrong?

01:17:14.531 --> 01:17:18.445
- Oh, is it Anya?
- Has she fallen for someone else?

01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:20.403
Christian!!

01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:25.829
It doesn't matter. It's no use.

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:36.875
- Why are you so dumb?
- Me?

01:17:37.594 --> 01:17:44.391
- No. Men!
- Oh, men. Yeah, I know, honey.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.013
I guess we just sometimes
do the wrong thing, Anya.

01:17:49.938 --> 01:17:53.141
I thought, I thought he loved me, Dad.

01:17:53.358 --> 01:17:57.403
Oh, baby, maybe he
does, but he's young.

01:17:57.779 --> 01:18:01.278
He may not know how to
express it, that's all.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.119
We all make mistakes, sweetheart.

01:18:07.538 --> 01:18:11.405
Why did your mother have to go
to ballet tonight of all nights?

01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:15.327
Oh, baby, don't.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:21.176 --> 01:18:25.125
I put extra marshmallows in it,
so you could drown your sorrows.

01:18:26.889 --> 01:18:30.934
I guess there might be a chance
I'd get lucky enough to choke and die.

01:18:31.727 --> 01:18:34.265
Now tell me what happened?

01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:39.977
Anya and I are done and
my life is totally over.

01:18:40.235 --> 01:18:43.568
Nonsense.
Of course your life isn't over.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.816
It is! Nothing else
matters in this world.

01:18:47.033 --> 01:18:50.532
And she won't even listen to me.

01:18:52.163 --> 01:18:53.954
You just need to rest and you'll see.

01:18:54.165 --> 01:18:58.079
The world will look a lot brighter
in the morning, I promise.

01:19:19.563 --> 01:19:21.472
Rise and shine, playboy.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.849
We got something you're gonna love.

01:19:24.067 --> 01:19:25.099
Go away!

01:19:25.319 --> 01:19:29.398
I know it isn't blueray, but still,
I think you wanna see this.

01:19:29.614 --> 01:19:33.659
We shot a masterpiece. A
film about you and Anya.

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:35.825
Why don't we show you a clip,
so you can see for yourself.

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.575
If you can afford it, of course.

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:45.669
- I'll fast forward a bit.
- Shouldn't we call his bank first?

01:19:48.465 --> 01:19:51.466
Nice work bro, I personally never
thought you had it in you.

01:19:51.676 --> 01:19:53.219
You little bastards!

01:19:53.428 --> 01:19:55.670
Hold your horses and watch this...

01:19:55.889 --> 01:19:56.889
Open it.

01:19:59.851 --> 01:20:01.226
Oooooh!

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:05.141
You think that was bad?
Watch this!

01:20:07.816 --> 01:20:11.684
- Okay, but why would I do it?
- Lisa, you're my favorite cousin.

01:20:11.904 --> 01:20:14.311
<i>And... I'll pay you 100 dollars.</i>

01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:18.943
And a night out on the town
with my favorite cousin?

01:20:20.703 --> 01:20:22.696
I can't believe this!

01:20:22.914 --> 01:20:25.535
Wait. How did Peter even know
where we would be yesterday?

01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:31.293
- Why didn't you tell me right away?
- We are businessmen after all.

01:20:31.505 --> 01:20:34.126
And we had to finish the cut first.

01:20:34.341 --> 01:20:37.176
Atrue artist never shows
his work until it is finished.

01:20:37.386 --> 01:20:39.259
So bro, what will you pay for it?

01:20:39.471 --> 01:20:44.678
We gotta start remembering to get
our blackmail money up front!

01:20:45.393 --> 01:20:48.559
Dude, all I got from him was a
text saying his life was finished.

01:20:48.771 --> 01:20:49.971
And he spelled finished wrong.

01:20:50.064 --> 01:20:52.353
Ernie, buddy,
I need to borrow your Vespa!

01:20:52.566 --> 01:20:54.191
- What's going on, Vic, you ok?
- There's no time to explain.

01:20:54.401 --> 01:20:56.061
It's a life or death situation!
Please!!

01:20:56.278 --> 01:20:58.271
Well, alright, alright.
Take a chill pill.

01:20:58.488 --> 01:21:00.695
So look, the ah, the
blinkers are here and,

01:21:00.907 --> 01:21:03.279
This is a visor for your face, gas.

01:21:03.493 --> 01:21:05.901
Vic, most importantly, the brake.
Okay, yeah, whatever.

01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:07.745
But how do I start this damn thing?

01:21:07.956 --> 01:21:10.076
Perhaps you're better off
having your dad mail you in.

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:12.247
That way you'll get
there a little faster.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:16.243
- Ernie, start it up!!
- Damn! Someone's got their period!

01:21:18.424 --> 01:21:20.131
Do it.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:26.262
Hey, Vic, be careful, the brakes
aren't what they used to be!

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:40.435
Oh! Damn!

01:21:43.822 --> 01:21:45.400
Ahhh!

01:21:53.206 --> 01:21:56.456
<i>On the third day of high school I,</i>

01:21:56.667 --> 01:22:00.036
<i>Victor Knudsen, was hit by an epidemic.</i>

01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:03.171
<i>And we're not talking
chicken pox or the flu.</i>

01:22:03.382 --> 01:22:05.920
<i>Nope, we're talking a case of total,</i>

01:22:06.135 --> 01:22:08.756
<i>incurable "Anya-itis".</i>

01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:13.724
<i>And I Victor Knudsen, didn't live.</i>

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:17.599
<i>Goodbye Anya, my love.</i>

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:34.026
Anya?

01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:37.615
Is it really you?

01:22:38.498 --> 01:22:40.870
Hey, you.

01:22:41.668 --> 01:22:44.205
I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:47.705
I was just so hurt when I
saw that girl kissing you.

01:22:48.048 --> 01:22:50.622
But, how did you know?

01:22:50.843 --> 01:22:52.503
I saw the film.

01:22:53.262 --> 01:22:54.542
You did?

01:22:54.763 --> 01:22:57.468
Zack and Brian had an extra copy.

01:22:57.682 --> 01:23:00.387
Actually, they have
quite a few copies.

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:03.519
We may have to make
it worth their while,

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:05.521
So we don't end up on YouTube.

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:10.440
At least some of the footage
was used for something good.

01:23:22.038 --> 01:23:23.367
Oh, my God!

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:29.418
This is gonna be good!

01:23:34.258 --> 01:23:36.381
What the fuck?!

01:23:43.183 --> 01:23:45.222
- Pervert Peter!
- Pervert!

01:23:45.435 --> 01:23:48.886
But, she was only my third cousin!!

01:23:49.814 --> 01:23:53.230
Bye! Bye, Peter, we'll miss you.

01:23:55.528 --> 01:23:57.319
I brought you a cactus.

01:24:00.532 --> 01:24:03.367
Oh! Thanks.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.954
Anya, if I make it...

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:12.660
Do you think I could come over again?

01:24:12.877 --> 01:24:14.206
On a Wednesday?

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:18.121
Seriously. I'm pretty sure
you're gonna make it.

01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:20.941
And to hell with Wednesdays.
My parents are gone this weekend,...

01:24:21.051 --> 01:24:23.625
so we'll have the entire
house to ourselves.

01:24:24.471 --> 01:24:28.006
But, what would we
do all weekend long?

01:24:29.226 --> 01:24:31.349
But, what about my leg?

01:24:33.021 --> 01:24:36.603
Victor, I'm pretty sure you don't
really need your leg to do it.

01:24:40.069 --> 01:24:41.943
You really never give up, do you?

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:20.394
Oh, Victor will be so sorry he
didn't pay us for that footage.

01:25:20.607 --> 01:25:23.857
And my sisterfound the stash of
DVDs and destroyed them all.

01:25:24.068 --> 01:25:26.606
Plus all the hidden
cameras in her room.

01:25:29.281 --> 01:25:31.108
What's that flashing red light?

01:25:31.325 --> 01:25:33.285
Don't tell me you didn't
charge the battery again!

01:25:33.452 --> 01:25:35.326
- It was your turn!
- Shiiiit!

01:25:35.537 --> 01:25:38.372
- Gimme a break!
- No, no, no, no, no! Damn
