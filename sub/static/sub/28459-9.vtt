00:58.266 --> 01:01.200

an article online.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.133

Dorit Kemsley,

01:11.467 --> 01:13.467
- Immediately, all of the women

01:13.500 --> 01:16.300
assumed Lisa
was behind the story.

- I'm not gonna
let her bully me

for anything.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.667

- And then I think to myself,

01:21.700 --> 01:23.433
"Maybe she's going through
a hard time right now."

01:23.467 --> 01:24.633

01:26.367 --> 01:28.300

other person in your life?

01:28.333 --> 01:29.467
- As Lisa's friend,

01:29.500 --> 01:32.400
I felt awful
about this conversation

01:32.433 --> 01:34.533
happening behind her back.
She's not here,

01:34.567 --> 01:36.500
and we all have very strong
opinions about this, so it's...

01:36.533 --> 01:38.700
- I understand, but she chose
not to be here.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.500
- But--I know.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.300
- Maybe you're the only person
that can say to her,

"You know what? Like, what
the (BLEEP) are you doing?"

01:45.567 --> 01:47.166

01:47.200 --> 01:48.633
and lay everything out
on the table.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.266
- She should have walked away.
When TMZ walked up to her,

01:51.300 --> 01:53.133
she said,
"Excuse me, I can't talk."

01:53.166 --> 01:54.433
- Well, that wasn't
part of the plan.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.200

01:56.233 --> 01:58.300

a story to Radar Online

01:58.333 --> 02:00.166
and then I'm gonna go to TMZ

02:00.200 --> 02:03.200
and refute a story
I've given to Radar Online?

02:03.233 --> 02:05.233

you told her that's not true

that about you.

Then there's nothing
left to say."

09:02.266 --> 09:04.000
thinking about,

09:04.033 --> 09:07.133
like, a few weeks ago,
everything felt so different.

09:07.166 --> 09:10.100
It's weird. It's like there
was, like, a shift in energy.

everything perfect

It doesn't work that way.

to say to me,

some problems here and there.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.433
You have to accept that."

She's right. I still haven't
spoken to her, by the way.

09:22.633 --> 09:26.567
- Nothing?
- It really makes me feel sad.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.467
- We've had so many experiences
with her.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.133
You're such good friends.
It's horrible.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.633
- I mean, I have had issues
in the past,

09:31.667 --> 09:33.567
and there have been things
that happened.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.000
If we're gonna be honest,
we've already had this issue,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.667
but I still love her.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.166
- I don't want love like that.
- That's not love.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.200
- And I wouldn't love somebody
that I would say preys

09:43.233 --> 09:47.166

is manipulative, is a liar.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.100

somebody like that?

09:49.133 --> 09:51.066
I would detest them
actually, frankly.

09:52.066 --> 09:54.300
The only ways that I'm even
in an issue with her

09:54.333 --> 09:56.667
is because I didn't stand up
and say,

09:56.700 --> 09:58.266

that Ken spoke to you.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.600
That's totally unacceptable.

10:07.767 --> 10:10.033

I was a bit strong,

speaking on you

10:26.667 --> 10:28.200
you need to be

I'll see you soon.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.333

- How was Lisa?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.133
- She seemed happy

36:41.166 --> 36:43.200
that she had her family
and her friends there.

36:43.233 --> 36:45.200
- Oh, that's nice.
- I just, you know, told her

36:45.233 --> 36:48.100
that I wanted to meet with her
and see

36:48.133 --> 36:50.166
if we could get together
for lunch or something,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.000
because I don't know
her that well,

36:52.033 --> 36:55.300
and I don't have a lot
of--any history with her,

36:55.333 --> 36:57.266
and so I think that
there's been a lot of discord

36:57.300 --> 36:58.433
with everything.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.333
- The group?
- Yeah, and I think

37:00.367 --> 37:03.734
that there's a way for you
to mend it or not or whatever.

37:03.767 --> 37:07.033
- It's Lisa's birthday.
We're not speaking.

37:07.066 --> 37:09.266
We're not gonna spend
her birthday together.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.333
This is weird.
We're always together.

she's upset with any of us.

with her.

I don't even know
why she would be upset with me.

were all talking to her

37:22.467 --> 37:24.233
until I went to her house,

37:24.266 --> 37:26.433
and then all of a sudden
everyone got cut off.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.700
- If Lisa's feelings are hurt,

37:28.734 --> 37:31.700
her immediate defense
is she pushes you away,

37:31.734 --> 37:34.200
and when she's ready
she'll speak to you,

37:34.233 --> 37:38.233

like you've been punished.

the situation tonight?

37:40.333 --> 37:41.767

to bring anything up.

about anything?

37:46.300 --> 37:49.100
- No, I think she was
a little hesitant.

we were standing

40:37.433 --> 40:40.467
not that it was ever
that hot and heavy.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.367
And listen, I have so much,

40:42.400 --> 40:44.367
because I've learned a lot
because of him.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.400
I was deeply, madly in love
with him during our marriage,

40:47.433 --> 40:49.433
and in the end
it just petered out.

Mrs. Grammer; it's just not me.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.533
Whoever this is--I mean,

40:54.567 --> 40:56.400
I do in my heart believe
it's a woman.

40:56.433 --> 41:01.200
I mean, does she not know
that she's destroying a family?

41:01.233 --> 41:03.200
It wasn't forever. It just--

41:03.233 --> 41:05.367
- That's a nice way
of putting it.

if mine peters out too.

like this.

forget it.

out of Camille's mouth

41:36.500 --> 41:38.300
when she's talking
about Kelsey,

41:38.333 --> 41:40.633
or anyone if she's pissed off
at them for that matter.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.600
- I think Camille
needs another drink.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.100
- I need another drink.
See what happens every...

41:45.133 --> 41:46.333
- Yeah, one drink in.

41:46.367 --> 41:48.467
Camille, what else
can we talk about?

41:48.500 --> 41:52.500
- Did you ever male-groom PK?
- I don't do it.

41:52.533 --> 41:55.200
- I like to see my men
male-groomed. Like, male--

41:55.233 --> 41:58.600
- But thank God PK is very,
very well-groomed.

41:58.633 --> 42:00.567
He is so clean.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.567
- And I'm an ex-dental
assistant.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.567
It's hard for me because
I was a dental assistant.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.200
- [inaudible]?
- I was a dental assistant.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.100
- You were a dental assistant?
- Yes, I was.

42:10.133 --> 42:13.133
I'm really funny
about teeth, for real.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.200
God, before Lisa Vanderpump
got her teeth redone,

42:15.233 --> 42:16.600
I had an issue with the...

42:16.633 --> 42:20.333
[laughter]

42:20.367 --> 42:22.333
I had such an issue with
the gums.

42:22.367 --> 42:24.500
I was like,
honey, you need new caps.

42:24.533 --> 42:26.400
Your gum line is receding.

42:26.433 --> 42:28.133
And that was...

42:28.166 --> 42:31.266
- I'm done.
I'm very dehydrated.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.433
- I didn't know
she had her teeth done.

42:33.467 --> 42:36.166
[laughter]

42:36.200 --> 42:38.400
- Oh, my God, Camille.

42:38.433 --> 42:40.500
You need to zip it.

42:40.533 --> 42:42.433
You're going just a bit
too far.

42:42.467 --> 42:43.567
- I can't breathe.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.200
- I think I'm getting hives.

42:45.233 --> 42:47.166
- I know, I'm so hot.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.400
I know that I have my issues
with Lisa Vanderpump,

42:50.433 --> 42:52.633
but this kind of talk
out of Camille--

42:52.667 --> 42:55.567
I mean, that is next level.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.633
No going back from that.

42:57.667 --> 42:58.767
- And now they look great.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.367
Well, at least you can
stand her breath.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.266
I'm going down. I'm going down.

43:05.300 --> 43:09.333
Just bring my casket
to my wedding and after...

43:09.367 --> 43:11.400
I'll bring the 9-inch nails
next to it.

43:11.433 --> 43:16.767
We'll just put me in it.
God help me.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.400

Housewives of Beverly Hills":

43:19.433 --> 43:21.400
- It's the bride.

43:21.433 --> 43:24.734
- Hi!
- I love a bridal shower.

43:24.767 --> 43:27.300
- What happened to Vanderpump?
She's not here.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.200
She's not coming?

43:29.233 --> 43:32.300
- The last time I stood here,
it was with a friend of mine.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.500
Bitch!

43:34.533 --> 43:37.567
- It's so good to see you.
- I know, Lois!

43:37.600 --> 43:39.400
Lois is in town!

43:39.433 --> 43:41.266
- Guess who's here right now.
- Who?

43:41.300 --> 43:43.333
- She just sent me a text
saying, "I'm watching you."

- What?

43:44.734 --> 43:46.600
- Are you kidding me?
Is this a coincidence?

it happened or not.
