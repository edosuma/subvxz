WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:08.309
Oh. Look who decided to
grace us with her presence.

00:08.342 --> 00:12.813
Hey, Geoffrey.
Sorry I'm late.
Are you?

00:12.846 --> 00:16.517
Well, you know,
it's what you say.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.352
Christy, you're
a good waitress,

00:18.386 --> 00:20.154
but you are
constantly tardy.

00:20.188 --> 00:23.157
Let's focus on the first part
of that sentence.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.426
That sort of thing might have
flown with the old management...

00:25.459 --> 00:28.396
Who no one misses, by the way.
Get a guy with a degree

00:28.429 --> 00:30.698
in restaurant science, I said,
and here you are.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.334
Yes. A lot more often than you.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.369
Because of a little traffic
on the way from school.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.171
Promise it won't happen again.
No, it won't.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.639
You're fired.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.508
Yeah. No, I'm not.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.809
What?

00:41.842 --> 00:43.544
Yeah, sorry,
that just doesn't work

00:43.577 --> 00:45.579
for me right now.
What are the specials?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.548
I'm not telling you
the specials; you're fired.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.250
Let me guess

00:49.283 --> 00:50.718
Yes. But you're still fired.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.187
How about this?
I graduate in five months,

00:53.221 --> 00:54.555
you can fire me then.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.557
This isn't a negotiation.
Great.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.193
Hi. I'm Christy.
I'm your server.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.195
Our special is branzino,

01:01.229 --> 01:03.264
and on the side,
I'm guessing,

01:03.297 --> 01:04.798
is fingerling potatoes.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.634
It's balsamic-glazed
brussels sprouts.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.568
Thanks, Geoff.

01:07.601 --> 01:08.669
It's Geoffrey.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.474
Ugh. Sorry about that.
He's new.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.676
Oh. I don't have a pen,

01:15.709 --> 01:18.512
so I'm just gonna record
your order on my phone.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.849
Oh, crap.
I don't have enough space.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.652
Let me just delete
a couple things.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.687
*

01:43.571 --> 01:45.506
Hey.
Hey.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.541
How was your day?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.743
Not bad. I got fired.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.878
What?!

01:50.911 --> 01:52.680
Don't worry. It didn't take.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.749
Brought home some branzino.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.618
Oh, thank God.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.822
Who fired you,
the new manager?

02:01.855 --> 02:04.358
Yeah. Geoffrey.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.294
Ugh. Geoffrey with a "G"?

02:06.327 --> 02:07.628
Douche with a "D."

02:10.531 --> 02:13.801
Hey, uh, I just got off the
phone with your brother.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.637
Why'd Ray call you?
Because I'm his friend.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.839
But I'm his sister.
Yeah, but he likes me.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.509
Fine. What did he want?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.511
:
He asked me not to tell you.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.546
But you enjoy sex, so...

02:27.648 --> 02:30.351
He needs me
to bail him out of jail.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.386
Oh, no.
Of course he's in jail.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.654
He kept drinking
and doing coke.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.623
I told you this
was gonna happen.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.326
You've done it again,
Nostradamus.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.462
How much is his bail?
Two grand.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.930
Ah. That's why
he called you.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.732
And we're friends.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.237
So I'm guessing two grand--
public intoxication?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.405
I'm going with
resisting arrest.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.706
Maybe both.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.409
The old Bonnie Plunkett
daily double.

02:55.443 --> 02:59.347
Hey, if I'm drinkin',
I'm resistin'.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.882
I'll be back
in a couple hours.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.551
Nice try.
We're going with you.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.387
No, no, no. See, Ray
specifically asked me

03:06.420 --> 03:10.324
not to have you guys come along,
or to even tell you about the...

03:10.358 --> 03:12.593
Why

03:12.626 --> 03:15.463
That's okay. I'll get the door.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.866
*

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734
So, what's the plan?

03:20.768 --> 03:23.871
Do we let him sleep it off and
drag him straight to a meeting,

03:23.904 --> 03:26.740
or do we just lock him
in a cage with Marjorie?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.876
Maybe have an ounce
of compassion first.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.412
I had compassion
the last time he messed up.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.582
This time, I've got a sock full
of nickels with his name on it.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.650
Starting to see why Ray
didn't want to call you.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.322
This place looks
so familiar.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.457
Was I ever arrested here?

03:43.491 --> 03:44.925
I thought that, too,
and then I realized

03:44.958 --> 03:46.927
it looks exactly like
the jail in Carlsbad.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.463
Yes.
What'd you do in Carlsbad?

03:49.497 --> 03:50.531
Shoplifting?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.765
Ooh, that was Temecula.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.467
Carlsbad was drunk, disorderly,

03:53.501 --> 03:55.603
and partially nude.
Partially nude!

03:55.636 --> 03:59.840
I still contend Sharpie
on my nipples counts as a shirt.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.710
I went to bail her out,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.012
it was taking forever,
so I strike up a conversation

04:05.045 --> 04:06.680
with a bounty hunter,

04:06.714 --> 04:09.617
and bing-bang-boom,
there we were, just...

04:09.650 --> 04:12.720
You know what?
Story for another time.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.862
Son of a bitch.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.898
Sorry, man. Hard to sneak out
of the house in a wheelchair.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.667
Oh, my God, Ray,
are you all right?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.702
I'm fine.
I just needed a ride.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.805
And $2,000 bail.
Which I will pay back.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.841
Which you will pay back.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.711
Anyway, you hurt
Come on, the car's this way.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.781
*

04:42.049 --> 04:44.718
So, are you gonna
tell us what happened?

04:44.752 --> 04:47.788
It wasn't my fault.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.658
It's like he doesn't know
who he's talking to.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.825
I'm serious.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.694
I was at a bar
watching the Warriors,

04:53.727 --> 04:55.729
and this jackass
got in my face.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.031
That was a great
game, huh?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.800
Sorry. It was.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.035
Come on, Ray,
tell us what you did.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.771
I don't want
to talk about it.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.807
Okay, then just listen.
We're gonna go to our place,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.842
get you a shower,
pour some coffee in you,

05:08.876 --> 05:10.811
and then we're
going straight to a meeting.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.880
Oh. Tuesday
meeting's the best.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.115
: There's a
celebrity in there.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.651
I can't tell you
who it is, but...

05:17.685 --> 05:21.054
hint:
he's a successful magician.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.858
Yeah. I don't need a meeting.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.797
We just got you out of jail.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.833
Your cell phone is
still in a Ziploc bag.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.569
Look, I know I've been
hitting it a little hard,

05:35.603 --> 05:37.438
and I'm gonna clean that up,

05:37.471 --> 05:40.674
but I'm not doing AA.
Why not?

05:40.708 --> 05:43.043
Well, for starters, I'm
really not into the God stuff.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.678
It doesn't have to be God.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.847
You can make your higher
power anything you want.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.817
Yeah. Mine's Oprah.
What can't she do?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.720
I know how to stop.
I've done it before.

05:52.753 --> 05:56.056
Technically, if you stopped
before, you haven't stopped.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.591
I'm just sayin'.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.992
Okay, my headache
is getting worse.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.595
Adam, is it okay
if I crash at your place?

06:01.629 --> 06:05.098
Um...
And by "um,"
he means no.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.502
Hey, I know you think you got
my balls in your jewelry box,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.070
but I can speak for myself.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.839
If the idea is

06:11.872 --> 06:14.775
that you're gonna get clean,
then sure, you can stay with me.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.879
Thanks, man.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.919
:
The rest of this drive

06:25.953 --> 06:27.955
is going to be awkward.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.990
*

06:43.203 --> 06:45.005
Hi. I'm Christy,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.174
and I see you still
have your menus,

06:47.207 --> 06:49.176
which means you haven't ordered,
and I bet you're starving,

06:49.209 --> 06:50.177
so let's get this party started.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.912
Christy.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.581
Kind of busy
here, Geoffrey.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.783
These people have a serious
case of the hungries.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.686
Excuse us. Your actual waitress
will be right back.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.220
You're late again,
and you're fired.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.623
I mean it.
You are super fired.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.859
I thought I was pretty clear
that that doesn't work for me.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.161
Well, you know what
doesn't work for me? You.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.463
Leave.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.998
Fine.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.535
I would normally sneak this
out the back,

07:14.568 --> 07:16.203
but you leave me no choice.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.085
Something on your mind, Bonnie?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.254
I just texted Adam
to see how Ray's doing,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.223
and he's not responding.
Hey, give him time.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.792
That is not how I roll,
and he knows it.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.228
It's just so frustrating--
for the first time in my life,

07:41.261 --> 07:44.565
I know what I'm talking about,
and nobody is listening to me.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.067
You can't force someone
to go to meetings.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.036
See? Right there, not my style.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.139
Anything worth doing is worth
forcing someone to do it.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.075
That doesn't really
make sense.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.111
And yet if Marjorie said it,
you'd tattoo it on your ass.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.882
Hey.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.651
Hey. How come
you're not at work?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.686
That part of my life is over.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.822
What?
Yeah.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.157
Geoffrey fired me again.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.959
And this time, it stuck.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.661
No, no, no, no.
This wreaks havoc

08:13.694 --> 08:15.295
with our delicate ecosystem.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.064
I'm roof, you're food.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.132
I know.
I'm kind of freaking out.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.136
Well, certainly, there's no
shortage of restaurants in Napa.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.705
You guys don't get it.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.507
I am a terrible waitress,
but I had tenure.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.978
I could come and go as I please,

08:31.011 --> 08:33.113
I could bully the newbies
into switching shifts with me,

08:33.146 --> 08:36.216
and I knew how many steaks
I could sneak out in my pants.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.888
Three to five,
depending on the cut.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.023
Cut of steak
or cut of pants?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.993
Both factor in.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.061
There's got to be
a way out of this.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.930
What if you...
bang your manager?

08:49.963 --> 08:50.864
Mom.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.332
I'm sorry. Make love to him.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
Not an option.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.836
How did this happen?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.271
My brother's an addict,
my fiancé's an enabler,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.273
my daughter can't keep a job.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.876
I'm so tired of being
everybody's rock.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.147
Oh, my God.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.983
Ooh, Ray and Adam went
to the gym,

09:10.017 --> 09:11.919
and now they're having
smoothies.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.821
What the hell is going on?

09:13.854 --> 09:16.089
Who cares as long as
Ray's staying sober?

09:16.123 --> 09:19.192
Yeah. See? It's possible
he found a different path.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.328
Meh? Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh,
meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.600
Wow. Sobriety without meetings.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.169
Can you imagine
how much free time we'd have?

09:29.202 --> 09:32.305
I could finally write
my young adult novel.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.109
I've got it all outlined
in my head.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.345
Teenage vampires fall in love,

09:38.378 --> 09:40.748
but then one of them
gets cancer.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.717
You're hooked, right?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.856
I don't want to
say yes, but yes.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.261
Ugh. Now those bastards are
hitting a farmer's market.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.831
No, we don't want blueberries.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.302
*

10:04.171 --> 10:07.641
Oh, come on.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.276
Hey, Geoffrey, can't
talk, really busy.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.811
You don't work here.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.079
Sure I do.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.214
I got tables three,
six, nine, 14,

10:14.247 --> 10:15.983
and a deuce
over near the bar.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.186
Hey, heads-up, she said her
branzino was a little fishy.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.888
We are not paying you.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.123
That's fine. I'll
just work for tips.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.159
Hey, stay out of my hair,
I might even deal you in.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.029
You leave
or I'm calling the cops.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.399
And how will that call go?

10:32.432 --> 10:34.367
"Oh, no. A tiny
woman wants to work

10:34.401 --> 10:36.369
in my restaurant
for free. Help me."

10:37.771 --> 10:40.040
This conversation is over.
Get out.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.174
Excuse me. Waitress?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.343
Ah, see? She called
me "waitress."

10:43.376 --> 10:45.078
Customer's always right.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.716
*

10:48.749 --> 10:50.884
I-I-I get it,
you're sorry.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.754
No, no, no. Let me do this.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.991
I...

10:58.025 --> 11:00.961
tried to...

11:00.994 --> 11:04.097
force my will...

11:04.131 --> 11:07.835
on this situation,

11:07.868 --> 11:11.271
which was wrong.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.206
And Ray...

11:13.240 --> 11:16.710
has clearly found his...

11:16.744 --> 11:19.679
own path, which is great.

11:21.749 --> 11:26.286
And you were just
trying to help,

11:26.319 --> 11:29.356
which is... also great.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.995
I'm sorry.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.031
This is hard for me.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.833
No kidding. You sound like

11:39.867 --> 11:41.201
you're learning
a second language.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.906
I usually don't apologize.
I just pay the fine.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.808
Well, it means a lot to me,

11:47.841 --> 11:51.478
and tell Marjorie I said
thank you for making you do it.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.047
Will do.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.049
Oh, hey, Bonnie.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.118
You guys are two hours away

11:58.151 --> 12:00.253
from the best French onion
soup you have ever had.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.055
I'm glad you're here.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.124
I have to apologize.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.359
Put that bag down,
this takes a while.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.798
Ray, I'm sorry I, uh, tried

12:10.831 --> 12:14.101
to force my will
in this situation.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.368
Oh, say no more.
Time to hug.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.937
Oh.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.105
:
Thank God.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.074
Wish I knew that was an option.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.244
I am so happy to hear you say
that 'cause you're my sister,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.213
I'm your brother
and we're all we got.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.281
I mean, you got him,
and he's my friend,

12:28.315 --> 12:30.083
so I guess I got him, too,
and actually,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.952
he's gonna be my brother-in-law
so we're all family.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.955
* We are family

12:34.988 --> 12:37.257
* I got my white sister
and me. *

12:37.290 --> 12:39.092
I love that song!

12:39.126 --> 12:40.828
Are we singin'
or are we soupin'?

12:40.861 --> 12:42.495
Soup now, sing later.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.333
* We are making soup, uh

12:46.366 --> 12:48.969
(Ray continues
vocalizing excitedly)

12:49.002 --> 12:51.104
You see what's going
on here, right?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.505
Bonnie, I work in Hollywood,
I know when someone's

12:52.539 --> 12:55.275
coked out of their mind.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.582
So I found this rehab in
Tennessee that has a bed,

13:02.615 --> 13:05.385
but they don't take the kind
of insurance Ray has.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.188
Wendy says she knows a place,
but, you know,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.257
she also recommended
that Korean barbecue

13:10.290 --> 13:12.559
that had us all in the bathroom
for a week.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.897
On the bright side, I finally
got to read Lonesome Dove.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.368
The other option
is keep him with us

13:21.401 --> 13:23.436
and he can be treated
as an outpatient.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.272
What do you think?

13:25.305 --> 13:28.108
Well, what does he want?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.943
Well, he wants to keep
getting high and make soup,

13:29.977 --> 13:31.444
so he doesn't get a vote.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.147
Wait a minute,
did he ask you for help?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.449
No, and I know what you're gonna
say, but he needs help

13:36.483 --> 13:38.886
and I am the only one
who can give it to him.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.287
I-It's not gonna work.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.455
It-it's going to work,
because it has to.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.291
All I have to do is...
Bonnie,

13:44.324 --> 13:47.394
you're making yourself crazy,
and if you don't stop,

13:47.427 --> 13:50.430
you're gonna end up drinking
long before you get him sober.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.901
So w

13:53.934 --> 13:55.435
You have to let him go.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.872
He's my brother.
I just found him.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.373
I'm not gonna lose him.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.374
I get it.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.076
A-All I have to do

14:03.110 --> 14:04.912
is convince him...
Bonnie,

14:04.945 --> 14:07.247
stop.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.220
I just...

14:13.253 --> 14:15.355
feel so helpless.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.992
I know.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.261
*

14:24.697 --> 14:27.200
You wanted to see me?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.502
This is her?
Yes.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.506
This is Leo Raskel,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.475
our regional manager.

14:37.577 --> 14:42.349
He's here today from corporate
in Sacramento.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.451
Look,

14:44.484 --> 14:47.354
I know I haven't exactly been
the best employee

14:47.387 --> 14:50.123
and I'm not
gonna stand here

14:50.157 --> 14:51.691
and tell you about
the struggles I've faced

14:51.724 --> 14:54.995
as a recovering alcoholic with
a dream of becoming a lawyer.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.466
Okay.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.139
What I am going to tell you
is that...

15:07.975 --> 15:10.010
I am your worst nightmare.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.514
I have worked at this restaurant
for 11 years,

15:14.547 --> 15:17.350
and I know where all the bodies
are buried.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.652
I know that your
locally sourced, organic,

15:19.686 --> 15:22.289
grass-fed beef is only
one of those things.

15:22.322 --> 15:26.293
I know that several of our
busboys live in the basement,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.095
along with assorted vermin.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.600
And I know that
we served the tip

15:33.633 --> 15:36.003
of Paul's finger
in last week's ceviche.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.574
I could go on, but, uh, I think
I've painted a picture.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.379
So, you fire me and all of this
goes on Yelp.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.148
Or you put me back on the books

15:48.181 --> 15:50.517
and that nice, pretty
four-and-a-half star rating

15:50.550 --> 15:51.951
stays right where it is.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.188
Works for me.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.592
See that, Geoffrey?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.195
That's how you make it
to Sacramento.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.098
Oh.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.100
I might be a little late
tomorrow.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.501
We'll see how it goes.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.214
Hey, Bonnie.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.683
Hello.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.520
So, um...

16:27.554 --> 16:29.189
Adam kicked me out.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.457
Yeah.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.791
He told me.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.326
What's the big deal?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.295
I got high once.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.364
The big deal is
you're an addict.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.099
And your life is
not gonna get better

16:39.132 --> 16:40.667
until you deal with it.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.605
Can I stay here?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.676
Nope.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.145
Seriously?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.514
What am I supposed to do?
Sleep in my car?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.383
I've done it.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.817
Little tip: park at Walmart.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.419
They won't kick you out.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.422
Bonnie, I'm your brother.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.393
I know... and I love you.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.845
There are a few announcements
before we begin.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.547
The community center has
asked us not to smoke

17:27.580 --> 17:29.449
on the property,
and not to park

17:29.482 --> 17:34.654
in the reserved spaces on the
north side of the building.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.290
I got your text.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.691
You did the right thing.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.593
It doesn't really
feel like it.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.862
I know.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.798
Would you kick me out if
I started using again?

17:45.832 --> 17:49.669
I did.
You just don't remember.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.672
If it helps,

17:52.705 --> 17:55.642
I never thought you were gonna
get sober, but you did.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.843
Back at ya.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.278
MEETING LEADER:
Please take a moment

17:58.311 --> 17:59.146
to silence your cell phones

17:59.179 --> 18:00.380
and out of respect
for the speaker...

18:00.413 --> 18:01.681
How's Adam dealing with it?

18:01.714 --> 18:04.651
He turned it over to
his higher power.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.719
*

18:09.722 --> 18:12.725
White Russian.
Keep 'em coming.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.895
Rough day?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.897
Ugh. Just this woman
who works for me.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.832
She's been busting my balls
all week.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.835
I hear ya.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.238
Bartender, put his drinks
on my tab.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.706
Hey.
Hey.

18:26.739 --> 18:27.707
Who's your friend?

18:27.740 --> 18:28.741
Ah, just another man

18:28.775 --> 18:30.477
with an ice pack
down his shorts.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.617
So, how you doin'?

18:37.650 --> 18:40.453
I'm okay, I just feel bad
about Ray.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.489
For what it's worth,
it means a lot to me

18:42.522 --> 18:44.224
that you tried
to help my brother.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.659
I like the guy.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.761
Think I'll get
my two grand back?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.264
Mm, you're adorable.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.665
Mm.
Tell you what,

18:52.699 --> 18:53.633
this round's on me.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.635
He'll have another beer.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.836
I'll take a Sprite.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.172
Coming up.
Wait a minute.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.308
Bonnie?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.243
Oh, my God.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.877
Frankie, is that you?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.679
I heard you were dead.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.349
Heard the same thing about you.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.218
You used to drink in here?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.952
No. Frankie and I
spent a weekend

19:12.985 --> 19:14.854
in the hull
of a ship and...

19:14.887 --> 19:16.556
You know what?

19:16.589 --> 19:17.824
Story for another time.
