[male radio host]:
Yeah, it looks like traffic's

00:22.990 --> 00:24.058
gonna be heavier than usual
this morning,

00:24.092 --> 00:25.126
with construction
blocking two lanes,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.261
but to keep you
in the holiday spirit

00:27.295 --> 00:28.796
while you're inching along,

00:28.829 --> 00:30.264
here's another
Christmas classic.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.165
["We Wish You A Merry Christmas"
playing]

00:31.199 --> 00:32.165
[shuts radio off]

00:32.200 --> 00:34.268
No thanks.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.237
Oh...

00:40.641 --> 00:44.678
Good morning, Los Angeles.
Let's make a day of it.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.450
Whoo.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.454
[***]

01:07.468 --> 01:08.736
Good morning.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.438
Hi. Hi.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.440
Morning.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.507
Morning, Sam.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.808
Morning, Ms. Harper.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.743
Are you all ready
for Christmas?

01:15.776 --> 01:16.877
Nope.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.446
Are you getting all ready
for Christmas?

01:18.479 --> 01:19.747
No.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.750
Are you planning on getting
all ready for Christmas?

01:24.352 --> 01:26.220
Sam, I love you, but if you say
"Christmas" one more time,

01:26.254 --> 01:27.288
I'll put a lump of coal

01:27.321 --> 01:29.123
in your stocking and hit
you over the head with it.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.090
I see you haven't

01:30.124 --> 01:31.725
lost any of your
charming Christmas spirit

01:31.759 --> 01:32.693
Morning, Jack.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.727
Fan mail?

01:33.761 --> 01:34.728
Don't be jealous.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.796
Oh, me? I'm content

01:35.829 --> 01:37.298
to bask in the glow
of your fame.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.532
Oh, please.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.533
Any mail for me?

01:43.604 --> 01:46.507
I had to move
the segments around a little

01:46.540 --> 01:47.608
for this morning's show.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.876
We had a cancellation.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.245
Turns out the Christmas twins
aren't talking to each other.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.746
Oh! Families
and holidays.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.482
Yeah, but I replaced them
with a guy

01:54.515 --> 01:56.517
who has the largest collection
of Christmas ornaments

01:56.550 --> 01:57.551
on the West Coast.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.452
Wait. Not
Dr. What's-His-Name?

01:58.486 --> 01:59.420
We had him on
last year.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.488
Yeah! Kwan!

02:00.521 --> 02:01.855
But he's got new ones
to show you,

02:01.889 --> 02:03.557
so we could make it
like an annual thing.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.459
Oh, I'm so glad I spent
all that money and time

02:05.493 --> 02:07.195
getting
a journalism degree.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.295
Well, you didn't spend
all your time

02:08.329 --> 02:09.330
getting a journalism degree.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.663
Hey, I worked hard in school.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.934
Yeah, but...
wasn't all work.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.704
At least... wasn't for me.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.541
Kinda off-topic, Jack.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.742
Kind of?

02:22.910 --> 02:24.378
You're right.
It's unprofessional.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.679
I apologize.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.348
I didn't mean--
you don't have to apologize.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.583
I just meant that college
was a long time ago.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.885
Doesn't matter
what happened back then.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.754
I get it.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.855
We're professional journalists.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.190
We have
a show to do.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.358
That's all I was trying to say.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.892
We have a show to do...

02:38.926 --> 02:41.729
and a lot of great memories.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.765
Maybe a couple.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.500
So...

02:46.534 --> 02:48.369
Uh, plans for the holidays?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.970
Um, uh, a week in Hawaii.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.272
You?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.606
-Aspen.
-Oh.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.874
You know...
Christmas, snow.

02:53.907 --> 02:54.875
-Nice.
-Yeah.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.846
Well, speaking
of shows to do...

02:58.879 --> 03:00.881
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll see you in the studio.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.617
Yes. I'll see you there.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.258
What kind
of memories?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.993
Wendy...

03:13.026 --> 03:14.295
Don't you know

03:14.328 --> 03:16.564
it's not polite
to eavesdrop?

03:16.597 --> 03:19.767
I wasn't eavesdropping.
I was full-on listening.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.001
Every time I come in here,

03:21.034 --> 03:22.836
I have this sudden urge
for peppermint.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.572
No, no, don't
change the subject.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.539
Why didn't
you tell me

03:25.573 --> 03:27.275
that you and Jack were
an item in college?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.343
We weren't an item.
We dated for a while.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.578
How long?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.012
Not that long.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.347
Just three years.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.815
Oh, well, pardon me!

03:34.848 --> 03:36.517
What, just a passing
fling, then?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.718
What happened?

03:37.751 --> 03:38.719
Nothing happened.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.622
Well, you didn't live
happily ever after, so...

03:41.655 --> 03:42.823
We graduated,

03:42.856 --> 03:45.393
then Jack got an offer from
a little station in Vermont.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.295
I got hired in Albuquerque.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.430
We tried to do the long-distance
thing for a while.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.598
Ooh, that is
a long distance.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.301
Which we figured out after
maxing out our credit cards

03:53.334 --> 03:56.036
on cross-country
red-eye flights, and...

03:56.069 --> 03:58.339
And?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.640
And after...

03:59.673 --> 04:01.742
Jack told me
he was getting married.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.943
To someone else.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.546
[sighs] Oh. That'd do it.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.281
I was surprised.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.949
We kinda lost touch
after that.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.418
Until he came to work here.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.919
Yes, and then

04:11.952 --> 04:13.654
we mutually agreed
that, whatever happened before,

04:13.687 --> 04:14.822
we had moved on,

04:14.855 --> 04:15.923
and the only thing that mattered

04:15.956 --> 04:18.291
was that we both
had a job to do.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.360
Building this
little morning show

04:19.392 --> 04:20.594
into a huge hit.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.796
Exactly.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.399
[***]

04:25.433 --> 04:27.401
You okay?

04:27.435 --> 04:29.303
Yeah.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.738
Is that
one of those mash notes?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.673
No. It's from my father.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.608
Oh! Well,
that's nice.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.710
Well, it's time to go.
Can you help me?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.679
Sure.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.847
Are you sure
you're okay?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.415
Yeah. Great.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.683
Thanks, Wendy.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.719
Wait. Jack isn't married.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.688
Not anymore.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.759
[***]

04:59.933 --> 05:02.102
Well, that's about
all the time we have today.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.572
I'd like to thank
my very special guest,

05:04.605 --> 05:05.639
Dr. Kenneth Kwan,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.975
for joining us again
this year

05:08.008 --> 05:10.578
with his fascinating collection
of Christmas ornaments.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.845
Kenny, maybe we'll see you
again next year?

05:11.879 --> 05:13.814
I'd like that, Kate.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.550
And thank you
to everyone watching at home.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.518
And, as this is--

05:17.551 --> 05:18.786
-Camera one.
-...Our final show of the year--

05:18.819 --> 05:19.953
Slow zoom.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.288
I'd like to wish each
and every one of you

05:21.321 --> 05:24.658
a very Merry Christmas
and a happy, healthy New Year.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.126
We'll see you next year.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.761
Music. Roll credits.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.630
[***]

05:29.663 --> 05:31.732
Nice work, everyone.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.833
Oh, Kenny,
that was great!

05:32.866 --> 05:33.801
Thank you so much.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.868
My pleasure.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.405
And... boom. We're out.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.807
That's a wrap!
Good job, everybody.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.009
Nice work. Nice work!

05:42.042 --> 05:44.545
Good job. Nice.
Good job, everybody.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.548
Merry Christmas.
You've earned it, right?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.384
Good job.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.585
Perhaps you'd allow me

05:51.619 --> 05:52.820
to give you
an early Christmas gift?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.789
Oh, that's from
your personal collection.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.925
This is one of my favorites.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.760
It's from
a little town in Norway.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.995
Very old, one of a kind.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.164
Oh, well, that's very generous,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.534
but, actually,
I don't have a Christmas tree.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.137
Thank you so much.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.773
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.007
Nice job.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.110
Good job, man.
Well done, everybody.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.779
[Kenny]: How do you
celebrate Christmas?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.514
-Audio's live.
-The truth is...

06:20.548 --> 06:21.615
I'm not much
of a Christmas person.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.650
We're on the air! Guys!

06:22.683 --> 06:24.452
What about
Christmas carols?

06:24.485 --> 06:26.119
And all the presents?
The lights?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.755
All those things are fine.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.057
I don't have anything
against Christmas.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.460
And children
singing in the park?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.662
Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.129
Kenny, I wouldn't know
a chestnut

06:36.163 --> 06:38.632
if you put a ribbon around it
and sent it to me by reindeer.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.468
Audio's live!

06:40.501 --> 06:41.869
Excuse me.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.672
I'm sure if you just
give yourself a chance...

06:44.705 --> 06:45.906
Please, I insist.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.975
I know, I just--
I don't like Christmas.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.577
Ahh!

06:49.610 --> 06:51.011
[crashing]

06:53.246 --> 06:55.449
Guys! Audio! Pardon me!

07:00.187 --> 07:02.590
Please tell me
we were off the air.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.928
[click]

07:08.996 --> 07:10.998
[sighs]

07:12.099 --> 07:14.968
[***]

07:15.002 --> 07:16.970
Jack, it was
an accident.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.572
Of course,
it was an accident!

07:18.606 --> 07:20.040
Obviously it was
an accident.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.675
Everybody saw
it was an accident.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.110
Then why do you
keep saying it?

07:23.143 --> 07:25.245
Look, the music
was playing,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.680
the credits
were rolling.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.482
And no one watches
the credits anymore.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.983
I doubt anyone
even saw it.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.084
You think?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.620
Absolutely.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.854
-It's no big deal.
-Yeah.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.959
[***]

07:38.992 --> 07:40.561
Oh, Ms. Harper...

07:40.594 --> 07:42.830
[***]

07:54.742 --> 07:56.176
[TV playing]

07:57.545 --> 07:58.679
[Male announcer]:
...Live announcement

07:58.712 --> 08:00.280
by morning show host
Kate Harper that, quote,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.616
"I just don't like Christmas".

08:02.650 --> 08:03.651
[sighing heavily]

08:03.684 --> 08:05.052
And in a turn of events,

08:05.085 --> 08:06.620
Ms. Harper
then pushed her guest,

08:06.654 --> 08:07.788
sending him
into a Christmas tree,

08:07.821 --> 08:08.822
and crashing to the floor.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.592
Please tell me
we were off the air.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.160
It was an accident.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.895
[phone rings]

08:17.965 --> 08:19.833
It was an accident.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.802
Turn off
the TV, Kate.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.305
[clicks TV off]

08:25.338 --> 08:26.774
What?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.041
You're going to
need some sleep.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.109
Why?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.644
We have a meeting
tomorrow morning.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.044
With Lauren.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.981
And she doesn't
sound happy.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.916
[sighing heavily]: Oh...

08:40.220 --> 08:43.323

08:43.356 --> 08:45.726
[Protestors]: * We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

08:45.759 --> 08:47.661
* We wish you a Merry...

08:47.695 --> 08:48.696
[Lauren]: Needless to say,

08:48.729 --> 08:51.198
our competition is having
a field day with this.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.200
It's pretty, though,
isn't it?

08:53.233 --> 08:56.103
So Christmas-y.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.905
I've always loved Christmas.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.641
But then... who doesn't?

09:00.674 --> 09:03.043
Oh. Right.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.179
Lauren, listen.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.881
I didn't mean to...

09:07.915 --> 09:09.116
[stammering]

09:09.149 --> 09:10.250
I turned around,

09:10.283 --> 09:11.685
and he was just
standing there--

09:11.719 --> 09:14.588
It was my fault,
Lauren.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.623
I was in the booth.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.791
I should've caught the mistake
with the audio.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.326
[Lauren]: It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.594
The damage is done.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.895
People are upset.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.698
Kate, your audience
is not happy with you.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.099
Darren?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.736
The video from the show
went viral in record time.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.370
Over five million
views and counting.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.039
No "likes".

09:32.072 --> 09:33.707
You're also
trending, big-time.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.942
What's trending?

09:34.975 --> 09:36.376
Hashtag "Harper
hates the holidays."

09:36.409 --> 09:38.078
I never said that.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.613
Hashtag "Send Kate
coal for Christmas."

09:39.647 --> 09:40.948
Hashtag "Bah, humbug,
Kate-Scrooge".

09:40.981 --> 09:42.382
Okay. I get
the point.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.018
People are threatening
to boycott our sponsors.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.286
No sponsors means no money.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.722
No money means no Morning Show
with Kate Harper.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.357
Try and make a day of that.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.760
[sighing]
All right. I messed up.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.863
But can't I go on the show
and apologize or something?

09:55.896 --> 09:58.766
Tell everyone how much
I really love Christmas?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.834
Do you really love Christmas?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.871
It's... you know...

10:03.904 --> 10:05.806
okay.

10:05.839 --> 10:09.743
Which is precisely why no one's
gonna buy your apology.

10:09.777 --> 10:14.381
I'm afraid this calls for
something more proactive...

10:14.414 --> 10:16.750
before this thing spirals
completely out of control.

10:16.784 --> 10:17.951
Such as?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.854
Darren?

10:20.888 --> 10:23.156
This came in
a few hours ago.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.292
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
* We wish
You a Merry Christmas... *

10:27.294 --> 10:28.729
"Hollyvale"?

10:28.762 --> 10:29.897
Hello, Kate Harper!

10:29.930 --> 10:30.898
I'm Ted Drysdale,

10:30.931 --> 10:33.433
mayor of
Hollyvale, North Dakota--

10:33.466 --> 10:35.969
"The Biggest Little
Christmas Town in the Country."

10:36.003 --> 10:37.905
What is this?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.907
Now, I know you're probably
asking yourself,

10:39.940 --> 10:41.675
"What's going on here?"

10:41.709 --> 10:44.978
Well, a lot of us saw
your TV show this morning,

10:45.012 --> 10:47.815
and darn it
if it didn't get us to talking.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.149
And we decided,

10:49.182 --> 10:52.986
what better way for Kate Harper
to find her Christmas spirit

10:53.020 --> 10:55.989
than to come visit us,
right here in Hollyvale,

10:56.023 --> 10:57.891
where we've got plenty to spare?

10:57.925 --> 11:00.460
So we'd like to invite you
to come on up

11:00.493 --> 11:03.263
and find out what Christmas
is really like.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.664
You never know...

11:04.698 --> 11:08.702
we might just put a little
"Ho, ho, ho" back in your day.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.037
Ho, ho, ho!

11:10.070 --> 11:11.338
Merry Christmas!

11:11.371 --> 11:13.206
[Santa chuckles]

11:13.240 --> 11:15.042
* ...Good tidings to you--

11:15.075 --> 11:15.843
[Lauren]:
The network has agreed

11:15.876 --> 11:17.878
to give you
a two-minute segment

11:17.911 --> 11:19.880
every evening for the week
leading up to Christmas.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.314
W-Wait, I--

11:21.348 --> 11:23.316
We'll do a remote,
showing how you've rediscovered

11:23.350 --> 11:24.918
the magic
and the spirit of Christmas.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.420
-It's perfect.
-A remote from where?

11:27.454 --> 11:30.323
You're going to Hollyvale.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.259
What?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.195
Jack, talk to accounting
about your travel expenses.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764
You can get
a local crew up there.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.266
What? Why do I have to go?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.101
Because it's your show, too,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.036
and I'm sure you'd like
to keep it on the air.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.442
Lauren,
I can't do this.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.244
I'm flying to Hawaii
tomorrow morning.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.913
Yeah, and I'm booked
on a flight to Aspen.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.114
You two seem to be under
the impression

11:54.147 --> 11:55.448
you have a choice here.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.484
Let me be absolutely clear.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.087
Kate, you have a serious
image problem,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.189
and the network has
canceled shows for much less.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.190
What?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.191
And Jack,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.292
your contract
is up for renewal next month.

12:05.325 --> 12:10.063
This could make negotiations
a tad... oh! ...awkward.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.498
But look on the bright side.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.366
You'll both still have
your vacation time.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.868
You'll just be together.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.937
And in Hollyvale.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.809
* Christmas time
at last is here *

12:21.842 --> 12:25.245
* And the stars
put on a show *

12:25.278 --> 12:26.847
* Lift our glasses

12:26.880 --> 12:31.551
* Sing some songs
we know from childhood *

12:31.584 --> 12:34.988
* Is that Santa's sleigh
a-coming? *

12:35.022 --> 12:38.091
* Hope this year
we've all been good *

12:38.125 --> 12:41.161
* Lots of laughing
lots of toys *

12:41.194 --> 12:44.431
* The memories will stay

12:44.464 --> 12:46.099
* Christmas time
for girls and boys... *

12:46.133 --> 12:47.467
[knocking] You okay?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.569
The van's circled the parking
lot three times already.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.839
We gotta go.

12:52.906 --> 12:53.974
Okay.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.376
Let's go.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.079
Tell me you brought
more winter clothes

12:59.112 --> 13:00.147
with you than that?

13:00.180 --> 13:01.114
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

13:01.148 --> 13:02.215
It's minus-10
degrees outside.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.316
You're gonna
freeze to death.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.417
Oh, exaggerate much?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.986
You know how you are
with the weather.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.020
I'll be fine.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.022
You complain when your
Chardonnay is too cold.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.124
I do not! Besides,
it hurts my teeth.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.960
Kate, maybe we should stop
on the way into town

13:12.993 --> 13:14.194
and get you
some warmer clothes.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.929
Oh, please! This outfit
was fine in Aspen.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.865
I'm sure
I'll survive Bismarck.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.101
[***]

13:23.070 --> 13:25.005
[gasps] Oh...

13:28.275 --> 13:29.877
Cold?

13:29.910 --> 13:32.512
Oh! Don't be ridiculous.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.481
It's very refreshing!

13:34.514 --> 13:37.017
Oh!

13:37.050 --> 13:38.852
Whoa! Oh, oh, oh!
Careful, careful, careful.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.887
You okay?

13:39.920 --> 13:40.921
I'm fine, I'm fine.

13:40.954 --> 13:41.989
Here. I'll get the bag.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.456
No, no. I got it.
It's fi-- Oh!

13:43.490 --> 13:44.925
[both gasp and groan]

13:44.958 --> 13:46.259
Are you okay?

13:46.293 --> 13:48.228
You did that on purpose.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.930
Don't flatter
yourself.

13:49.963 --> 13:50.964
Ohh...

13:50.998 --> 13:52.632
Ms. Harper?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.102
Yes, that's me!

13:55.135 --> 13:56.836
Who-Who are you?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.042
I'm Doug.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.643
Your crew.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.614
As in there are more of you
in the van, right?

14:07.647 --> 14:09.549
Nah. It's just me.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.454
Okay, well...

14:14.487 --> 14:16.256
It's nice
to meet you, Doug.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.925
You can call me Kate.

14:17.958 --> 14:18.959
Right.

14:18.992 --> 14:19.927
Hi. I'm Jack.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.161
Hi, Jack.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.297
All right, well, then,
we'd better go.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.099
You guys are gonna
freeze out here.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.467
Right.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.169
Yeah. The van's
right here.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.338
I'll get the bags.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.010
Be careful.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.013
J-Jack. J...

14:40.047 --> 14:42.449
[chuckles nervously]

14:43.616 --> 14:45.986
[***]

14:53.126 --> 14:54.962
[Doug]: Have you been
to Hollyvale before?

14:54.995 --> 14:57.164
First time.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.232
It sure is
something special.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.367
People come
from all over

15:00.400 --> 15:02.502
to visit during
the holidays.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.471
It's like the way
you remember Christmas

15:04.504 --> 15:06.239
from when
you were a kid,

15:06.273 --> 15:09.309
and you'd get
all tingly for it.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.982
I'm sure
it's very nice.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.384
We're on
a pretty tight schedule,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.219
and we were hoping
you could help us

15:19.252 --> 15:21.354
break the ice,
so to speak.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.622
Yeah,
whatever you need.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.024
Great! Well, uh,

15:24.057 --> 15:25.258
we'd like to talk
to some locals,

15:25.292 --> 15:26.693
to find out what it's like
to live here.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.030
Um, why Christmas is so special
for Hollyvale,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.631
and where do you get
all that Christmas spirit.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.034
Yeah. Sure thing.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.538
[***]

15:41.708 --> 15:44.411
[Doug]: Well... there it is.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.513
Welcome to Hollyvale.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.716
Whoa. Look at
all that Christmas!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.988
Hmm. I thought
it would be busier.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.524
I mean, Christmas
is only a week away.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.393
It kinda comes in waves...

16:00.427 --> 16:03.096
Uh, here and there.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.998
It gets busier.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.366
It's... yeah.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.068
Oh.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.070
Yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.513
This is Mia Walker,
reporting for Hollyvale News.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.382
Back to you, Bob.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.552
This is Mia Walker,
reporting for Hollyvale News!

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
Back to you, Bob!

16:27.387 --> 16:30.523
This is Mia Walker,
reporting for Hollyvale News.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.292
Back to you, Bob.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.028
Good Afternoon!

16:35.062 --> 16:36.163
Welcome to Hollyvale Inn.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.597
How can I--?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.203
Hi. We have
a reservation.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.238
"Let's make a day of it!"

16:45.272 --> 16:46.573
Kate Harper!

16:49.642 --> 16:51.578
This is such an honor.
I'm such a big fan.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.380
Kate Harper!
In my hotel!

16:53.413 --> 16:55.082
Wow!

16:55.115 --> 16:57.350
I-I don't mean "my" hotel.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.751
It's not like I own the place.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.254
It's just, I work here.
Obviously.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.489
Because, I mean,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.656
otherwise, what would I be doing
behind the front desk? Duh!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.358
I don't usually talk this much.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.727
Oh, happens to Kate
all the time.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.596
Well, yeah!

17:09.628 --> 17:10.797
He's kidding.
Just breathe.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.433
Breathe. Thank you!

17:13.465 --> 17:15.468
Your rooms are down here.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.503
[sighs,
stifles a chuckle]

17:17.537 --> 17:18.637
After you.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.772
Oh.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.277
I gave you the Santa Suite.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.279
I hope you like it.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.582
[Kate, awkward chuckle]:
Oh...

17:29.616 --> 17:32.219
[***]

17:35.222 --> 17:38.391
It's very... festive.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.626
Thank you.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.829
Ms. Harper, I know you probably
hear this all the time,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.231
but you're actually the reason

17:44.264 --> 17:45.532
I'm studying journalism
in school.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.167
Really?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.701
I mean, I'd never expect
to be like you,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.303
with the whole country
watching and all,

17:50.337 --> 17:51.504
but you inspire me.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.505
I think what you do
is important.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.873
And I think
you're the best at it.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.342
Thank you, Mia.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.409
Although you probably
should've reconsidered

17:56.443 --> 17:58.245
that thing you said
about not liking Christmas.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.413
Thank you, Mia.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.548
Well, if you need
anything else--

18:01.581 --> 18:03.783
I know where to find you.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.688
Kate Harper...

18:08.721 --> 18:10.223
Wow!

18:17.397 --> 18:19.432
[***]

18:20.833 --> 18:23.903
Well, if this isn't the star
on the Christmas tree!

18:23.936 --> 18:27.307
Ms. Harper, I cannot tell you
what an honor it is to meet you.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.309
Though I feel as if
we're old friends,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.178
after watching you
all these years.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.446
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, too, Mr. Mayor.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.547
This is my producer,
Jack Brewster.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.548
Mr. Mayor.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.649
Oh, you two!

18:36.683 --> 18:38.251
We don't stand on
ceremony around here.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.252
Call me Ted.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.220
Take a load off!

18:40.253 --> 18:41.254
Okay.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.289
Let's chat.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.491
Well, first off, Ted,

18:44.524 --> 18:46.293
thank you so much
for the invitation.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.561
It's very generous of you
to open up your town to us.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.897
Like they say--
"'tis the season."

18:50.930 --> 18:51.898
From what I've seen
of Hollyvale,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.234
you folks really take
the season very seriously.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.368
That's what makes us

18:55.402 --> 18:56.903
the "biggest little
Christmas town in the country."

18:56.936 --> 18:58.171
Like the sign says.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.273
Our town
is your town.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.475
And Ms. Harper...

19:02.509 --> 19:03.910
"Kate"...

19:03.943 --> 19:05.212
I meant what I said

19:05.245 --> 19:06.413
about you
coming to Hollyvale

19:06.446 --> 19:07.780
to find your Christmas spirit.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.682
And that's exactly
why we're here.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.452
To help Kate discover
the joys of Christmas,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.387
and also to see
what's so special

19:14.421 --> 19:16.289
about Christmas
to Hollyvale.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.457
You're gonna be doing
a segment on the news

19:17.490 --> 19:18.791
every night this week?

19:18.825 --> 19:19.792
Right here from town?

19:19.826 --> 19:20.827
That's right.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.495
So we're gonna be
on televisions

19:22.529 --> 19:23.730
all over the country?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.232
And on
our website.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.966
We have millions of viewers
on the Internet,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.201
all over the world.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.570
Does that sound okay, Ted?

19:30.603 --> 19:32.672
Sounds just fine.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.211
[***]

19:40.347 --> 19:42.549
[Kate]: Three, two, one...

19:42.582 --> 19:43.816
Cheese!

19:43.850 --> 19:44.984
[snap]

19:45.017 --> 19:45.985
Thank you, Ms. Harper.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.487
Oh, thank you.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.656
I think my Dad's
wrong about you.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.859
What do you mean?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.894
He says they should change
the name of your show to

19:54.927 --> 19:57.630
"The Morning Show
with Kate Scrooge."

19:57.664 --> 19:59.532
[forced laugh]

19:59.566 --> 20:00.500
[chuckling]

20:01.601 --> 20:02.735
Bye-bye now.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.306
I can see
the poster.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.274
Oh, it's not funny.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.675
It's funny.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.310
I should be
on a beach in Hawaii,

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
and instead, I'm here,
trying to prove to people

20:11.678 --> 20:12.979
I'm not a Scrooge.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.214
Well, I don't think
you're a Scrooge.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.550
And I'm kinda
getting into

20:17.584 --> 20:19.652
this whole
"making spirits bright" thing.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.887
I don't know.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.921
It still seems kind of quiet
around here.

20:21.954 --> 20:22.922
You heard Doug.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.357
It'll pick up.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.492
[waitress]:
You folks ready to order?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.360
Oh--

20:27.394 --> 20:28.661
Actually, I have a question.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.697
Um, we're with
the TV crew.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.932
Oh, I'm not much
of a TV person.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.901
I spend most of my time
here, anyway.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.337
Well, that's exactly
what we're curious about.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.406
We thought the restaurant
would be a little bit busier,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.641
with Christmas being so close
and everything.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.512
What? No!
No, we're plenty busy.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.046
We have parties and reservations

20:47.079 --> 20:49.282
coming out of our ears
for the rest of the week.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.018
Tonight's just...
a little slow.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.820
It happens.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.855
Even in the biggest little
Christmas town in the country?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.758
Uh, yeah, I don't know
what I'm gonna order yet,

20:58.791 --> 21:00.593
so I'm gonna need
a couple minutes to...

21:00.627 --> 21:02.562
Sure.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.398
Hmm...

21:06.533 --> 21:08.368
What was that?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.436
What?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.905
Nothing.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.073
I know you.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.508
I know what you're doing.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.743
Don't.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.512
You're turning this
into an investigative piece.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.047
Okay, fine.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.349
Fine.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.883
Fine!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.888
But don't you think
it's weird that th--

21:28.921 --> 21:30.557
Wonder what the soup is.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.593
[***]

21:35.061 --> 21:36.429
I got to ask.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.564
Why don't you
like Christmas?

21:37.597 --> 21:38.465
I don't know.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.899
I mean, it's not that
I don't like it.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.368
I just...
I don't get it.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.370
[laughs]
You don't "get it"?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.405
I mean, people don't
like-- don't "get" golf.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.773
They don't "get"
hairless cats.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.940
But, Christmas,
on the other hand...

21:47.974 --> 21:49.509
Why are we talking
about this now?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.611
You knew this about me
in college.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.646
No! I was thinking about it,
and I didn't know.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.781
You did.
We talked about it.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.849
No, we talked
about everything else,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.485
but, come Christmas,
we'd go home for the holidays,

21:58.518 --> 21:59.752
we'd come back,
and say they were great,

21:59.786 --> 22:00.753
and that was that.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.624
Look, if you're worried about
me finding my Christmas spirit,

22:04.657 --> 22:05.692
you don't have to be.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.727
What?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.529
Jack, I've spent half my life
in front of the camera.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.698
I'll make it work,
one way or the other.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.566
[chuckles]:
Wha-- Katie, no.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.767
No, let me explain.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.102
Please don't call me that.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.038
I used to call you that
all the time.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.708
Yes, well, college
was a long time ago.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.743
We've kept it
professional, Jack.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.712
Let's not backslide.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.113
[carolers]: * Deck the halls
with bough of holly... *

22:27.146 --> 22:28.448
Right.

22:28.481 --> 22:31.818
* ...Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la *

22:31.851 --> 22:34.721
* 'Tis the season
To be jolly *

22:34.754 --> 22:37.056
* Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la *

22:37.089 --> 22:39.959
* Don we now
Our gay apparel *

22:39.992 --> 22:42.128
[carolers trail off
into the distance]

22:42.161 --> 22:43.763
Well, uh...

22:43.796 --> 22:45.164
Right.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.700
Early day tomorrow.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.769
Yep.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.373
[***]

23:13.526 --> 23:15.895
[***]

23:39.218 --> 23:41.087
[exhales deeply]

23:46.726 --> 23:49.128
[***]

23:53.766 --> 23:54.967
You ready?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.168
Yes. Yes, got it. Ready.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.837
All right.
And... rolling.

23:57.870 --> 23:58.871
Rolling!

23:58.905 --> 24:00.106
And... action.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.240
They call it

24:01.273 --> 24:03.810
the "biggest little
Christmas town in the country,"

24:03.843 --> 24:05.912
and when you come
to Hollyvale, North Dakota,

24:05.945 --> 24:07.714
you can see for yourself why.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.881
Take one look around,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.883
and it's pretty clear

24:10.917 --> 24:13.786
there's something very special
about this little town.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.222
But it's more than
the lights and decorations.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.758
It's the feeling you get
when you're here.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.893
It's the spirit of Christmas.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.895
I'm Kate Harper,

24:22.929 --> 24:23.796
and for the next few days,

24:23.830 --> 24:26.132
we'll get to know
Hollyvale a lot better

24:26.165 --> 24:27.600
and find where
that Christmas spirit

24:27.634 --> 24:28.801
comes from.

24:28.835 --> 24:31.070
And hopefully, while we do,

24:31.103 --> 24:32.739
I'll have the chance to learn

24:32.772 --> 24:35.742
what it means
to really love Christmas.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.210
And cut. That was great!

24:38.244 --> 24:39.879
-Got it?
-Yeah. It was good.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.080
All right. Got it.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.015
-Moving on?
-Moving on.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.184
Are you guys cold?

24:45.217 --> 24:47.186
Gosh, I don't know!

24:47.219 --> 24:48.555
I just love
it all so much

24:48.588 --> 24:49.522
But is there something
in particular

24:49.556 --> 24:50.790
that makes Christmas
in Hollyvale

24:50.823 --> 24:52.224
special for you?

24:52.258 --> 24:53.593
Well, I guess
I would say

24:53.626 --> 24:54.627
it was the big
Christmas tree

24:54.661 --> 24:56.963
that went up every year
when I was growing up.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.198
I just loved
the way it felt,

24:59.231 --> 25:01.534
how it brought
everybody together.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.136
How it brought
everyone together?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.205
Hey, Doug.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.275
Hi, Olive.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.912
[***]

25:14.180 --> 25:16.115
Well, thank you
for your time, Olive.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.618
I'm Kate Harper,
NTN News.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.719
[man]: Yeah!

25:19.752 --> 25:21.220
No, that would
definitely be it.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.856
The big tree,
every year.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.157
I mean, this goes way back,

25:25.191 --> 25:26.659
my parents talked
about when they were kids,

25:26.693 --> 25:27.894
and how much they loved it.

25:27.927 --> 25:28.795
So a tradition,

25:28.828 --> 25:31.731
passed down from
generation to generation?

25:31.764 --> 25:34.100
That's right!
A tradition. Hey.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.703
Look what I've got.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.671
Oh... there you go!

25:38.705 --> 25:40.740
Now, who
wants a candy cane?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.074
I do!

25:42.108 --> 25:44.343
There you go.
And then one for you.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.078
Great.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.015
Okay.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.016
Now, if someone would just
point me towards

25:50.049 --> 25:52.151
this Christmas tree
everyone loves so much...

25:52.184 --> 25:54.186
They always put it
in the town square.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.822
Wait. You know about it?

25:55.855 --> 25:58.124
Yeah. My parents used to
bring me to Hollyvale

25:58.157 --> 25:59.726
every Christmas
to see the tree

25:59.759 --> 26:00.760
when I was growing up.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.328
-Well, lead the way!
-Yeah.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.263
Okay. Follow me.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.705
It was always
right here.

26:13.906 --> 26:14.874
[Jack]:
Are you sure?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.776
[Doug]: Every year.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.945
Well, it's not
here now.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.379
Well, that's strange.
Why would people talk about

26:20.412 --> 26:22.248
a Christmas tree
that's not even there?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.317
Can I help you folks?

26:25.351 --> 26:26.719
Uh, yeah. Hi.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.820
Jack Brewster.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.021
Sheriff Omar.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.056
This is Kate Harper.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.758
We're from NTN News,
Los Angeles.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.893
Oh, the Mayor said there
was gonna be a TV crew in town.

26:33.926 --> 26:34.861
How's it going, Doug?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.328
Hey, Robby.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.897
Does everybody in this
town know each other?

26:37.930 --> 26:40.132
Sheriff, uh,
what happened

26:40.166 --> 26:42.234
to the Christmas tree that's
supposed to be here every year?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.370
Oh. Yeah. No.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.105
They haven't done
that in...

26:46.138 --> 26:48.074
I don't know,
a couple of years now.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.909
[Doug]:
But it was tradition.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.111
Well, I guess they decided
to stop making it a tradition.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.112
Do you know why?

26:53.145 --> 26:55.247
Oh, search me.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.716
There's so much red tape
with these things now,

26:56.749 --> 26:57.950
it's a wonder
anything gets done.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.886
You got
a point there.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.253
Well, I've gotta roll.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.856
You folks take care
and Merry Christmas.

27:03.890 --> 27:04.991
Merry Christmas.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.092
Thanks, Sheriff.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.094
Merry Christmas, Rob.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.797
What do you think?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.699
I think we don't
have a show yet.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.105
[Lauren]:
All right, so there's no tree.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.140
There must be something else
around there

27:21.173 --> 27:22.775
that says Christmas.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.977
Just stand in front of it
and roll the camera.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.278
[Jack]:
Well, that's the thing.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.080
The whole town "says" Christmas,

27:28.114 --> 27:30.817
but our story's about
the "feeling" of Christmas.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.318
I'm afraid you lost me.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.253
Lauren,
you sent me here

27:34.286 --> 27:35.888
to find
my Christmas spirit,

27:35.922 --> 27:37.924
but when you talk
about Christmas spirit

27:37.957 --> 27:39.158
around here,

27:39.191 --> 27:40.459
you're really talking
about that Christmas tree

27:40.492 --> 27:42.028
that's been
in the town square.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.796
If the tree's so important,
why isn't it there now?

27:44.931 --> 27:46.265
We don't now.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.800
Now, we are gonna
try and find it,

27:47.834 --> 27:48.667
but even if we do,

27:48.701 --> 27:50.269
it doesn't necessarily
solve the problem.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.904
Because all
of our interviews

27:51.938 --> 27:52.972
are about that tree,

27:53.005 --> 27:55.107
and, well, there's no
point in talking about it

27:55.141 --> 27:56.776
if we can't show it.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.411
You guys know
I love you, right?

27:59.445 --> 28:01.380
But the network
has been promoting

28:01.413 --> 28:03.950
these spots since you left--

28:03.983 --> 28:06.786
"Kate Harper
Finds Her Christmas spirit."

28:06.819 --> 28:08.721
Everybody's over the moon
about it.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.289
They want to hold hands
in a circle

28:10.322 --> 28:12.391
and sing
"I'll Be Home for Christmas."

28:12.424 --> 28:13.425
Oh, but, Lauren--

28:13.459 --> 28:15.227
So I don't care
what you have to do,

28:15.261 --> 28:16.495
or how you have to do it.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.297
Just find

28:18.330 --> 28:19.265
your Christmas spirit, Kate,

28:19.298 --> 28:20.499
and find it fast.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.202
Merry Christmas. Bye.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.074
[sighing]

28:28.107 --> 28:29.842
Now what?

28:31.143 --> 28:33.813
Maybe they're hiring
at the Home Shopping Channel.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.414
[knocking on door]

28:35.447 --> 28:37.416
[***]

28:40.987 --> 28:42.354
I hope
I'm not interrupting.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.322
No, come in.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.757
I know you guys have
been working all day.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.225
I figured you might be hungry.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.493
We squeeze the apples
right here in town

28:47.526 --> 28:49.361
for the cider,
and I made the cookies myself.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.362
Oh! Thanks, Mia.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.463
Oh, my gosh!

28:51.497 --> 28:53.900
You're working
on the show right now?

28:53.933 --> 28:55.501
That is so cool.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.469
Sometimes,
I have to pinch myself.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.171
Well, I don't want
to get in the way.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.506
If you need
anything else...

29:00.539 --> 29:02.274
Uh, Mia?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.443
You said you were
studying journalism, right?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.079
Well, if you were gonna
do a story

29:07.113 --> 29:09.015
about Christmas in Hollyvale,
where would you go?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.316
[Mia]: That's easy.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.984
I'd talk
to Millicent Aberdeen.

29:12.018 --> 29:15.254
[***]

29:15.287 --> 29:17.924
[Millicent Aberdeen]:
The founder of Hollyvale,

29:17.957 --> 29:18.991
Daniel Hollis,

29:19.025 --> 29:20.392
loved Christmas.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.361
It's said that
when he was a child,

29:22.394 --> 29:24.396
he was actually in the room

29:24.430 --> 29:26.866
the night Clement Moore
first read his poem,

29:26.899 --> 29:28.835
"The Night Before Christmas."

29:28.868 --> 29:30.202
And every Christmas Eve,

29:30.236 --> 29:32.939
Daniel would gather together
the children of Hollyvale

29:32.972 --> 29:35.341
for hot chocolate
and Christmas cookies.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.276
He would read
the story aloud

29:37.309 --> 29:38.444
by his fireside,

29:38.477 --> 29:41.480
and then send each child home
with a Christmas present.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.415
Sounds like a wonderful man.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.884
Oh, he must have been,

29:44.917 --> 29:46.853
because he left
instructions in his will

29:46.886 --> 29:49.288
to continue that tradition
every year

29:49.321 --> 29:51.157
by giving the people
of Hollyvale

29:51.190 --> 29:52.959
a gift at Christmas.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.393
What was that?

29:54.426 --> 29:55.561
Daniel said

29:55.594 --> 29:57.129
that a Christmas tree
should be placed

29:57.163 --> 29:59.932
in the Hollyvale
Town Square

29:59.966 --> 30:01.868
and lit as a reminder

30:01.901 --> 30:03.535
of the Spirit of Christmas.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.237
We've heard a lot
about those trees.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.073
People remember them
very fondly.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.474
Oh, yes.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.843
And yet there hasn't been
a tree in the square

30:10.877 --> 30:11.978
for the last two years?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.245
No.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.981
Can you tell me why?

30:21.587 --> 30:24.256
Two years ago,
the trees just stopped coming.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.925
I don't understand.

30:25.958 --> 30:29.028
You see, when the town
was incorporated,

30:29.061 --> 30:31.964
Daniel retained ownership
of the square.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.900
You mean, the square
in the middle of the town

30:33.933 --> 30:35.467
is actually private property?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.936
Mm-hmm.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.137
And the only condition

30:38.170 --> 30:40.272
on Daniel's Christmas gift
to the town

30:40.306 --> 30:44.043
was that the tree in the square
had to be a Hollis tree,

30:44.076 --> 30:46.212
placed on Hollis land.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.247
So if it's not a Hollis tree,

30:48.280 --> 30:49.648
then technically,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.984
there can't be a Christmas tree
in the square.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.319
Exactly.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.021
But every year,
like clockwork,

30:55.054 --> 30:56.222
the trees came.

30:56.255 --> 30:59.191
Until Vernon Hollis
stopped sending them.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.392
But why?

31:01.527 --> 31:02.995
No one knows.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.998
Thank you for your time,
Millicent.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.068
Reporting from Hollyvale,
North Dakota,

31:09.101 --> 31:11.403
I'm Kate Harper
for NTN News.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.605
Yes, we have a show.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.546
[clears throat awkwardly]

31:20.579 --> 31:22.148
Yeah. Yeah, there's uh...

31:22.181 --> 31:23.549
a little bit more
editing to do,

31:23.582 --> 31:25.117
but, um... yeah.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.986
There's energy,
there's heart,

31:27.019 --> 31:27.987
there's Christmas.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.288
And we have mystery.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.289
We have it all.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.158
That interview you were
doing with Millicent

31:32.191 --> 31:34.093
was pretty solid

31:34.126 --> 31:36.328
before you started
talking about trees.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.563
But that was
the best part.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.564
What happened
to the trees?

31:38.597 --> 31:39.631
How come
the Hollis family

31:39.665 --> 31:41.200
doesn't send
them anymore?

31:41.233 --> 31:43.569
Yeah, no,
that's good, too.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.171
People are going
to eat it up.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.172
Yeah.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.709
Um...

31:50.742 --> 31:52.011
Jack, about what happened

31:52.044 --> 31:53.379
last night...

31:53.412 --> 31:54.981
I didn't mean to snap
at you like that.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.083
Forget it.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.550
No, it's just,
it's this time of year.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.685
I don't know, I...

31:59.718 --> 32:01.187
I should lock myself in a cave

32:01.220 --> 32:03.089
for a couple
of weeks.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.057
Anyway, I'm sorry.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.960
That's okay.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.600
Well, I'll let you
finish up.

32:14.633 --> 32:15.501
Okay.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.036
Okay. Yeah.

32:17.069 --> 32:17.970
[clearing throat]

32:23.342 --> 32:25.177
...Reporting from Hollyvale,
North Dakota,

32:25.211 --> 32:27.980
I'm Kate Harper for NTN News...

32:43.295 --> 32:44.396
Oh, Ms. Harper?

32:44.430 --> 32:46.198
There's a package
here for you.

32:46.232 --> 32:49.301
Oh. Thanks, Mia.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.437
I noticed there's
no return address.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.039
Thanks, Mia.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.413
Aw, that's cute.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.283
Who are they?

33:04.316 --> 33:07.319
Uh, just some people
I used to know.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.427
[***]

33:30.842 --> 33:32.010
...And finally this evening,

33:32.044 --> 33:34.713
we bring you the first
of five special reports

33:34.746 --> 33:36.748
from Hollyvale, North Dakota,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.717
where our own Kate Harper
has gone

33:38.750 --> 33:40.652
to find her Christmas spirit.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.787
This is so cool.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.722
They call it

33:43.755 --> 33:45.657
the "biggest little
Christmas town in the country,"

33:45.691 --> 33:47.793
and when you come
to Hollyvale, North Dakota,

33:47.826 --> 33:50.062
you can see for yourself why...

33:50.096 --> 33:52.064
[Olive]:
Well, I guess I'd say

33:52.098 --> 33:53.699
it was the big Christmas tree
that went up every year

33:53.732 --> 33:55.167
when I was growing up...

33:55.201 --> 33:57.103
[man]: I mean,
this goes way back,

33:57.136 --> 33:58.204
my parents talked about
when they were kids,

33:58.237 --> 33:59.838
and how much they loved it.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.707
[Millicent]:
The founder of Hollyvale,

34:01.740 --> 34:03.575
Daniel Hollis, loved Christmas,

34:03.609 --> 34:05.144
because he left instructions
in his will

34:05.177 --> 34:07.779
that a Christmas tree
should be placed

34:07.813 --> 34:09.614
in the Hollyvale Town Square

34:09.648 --> 34:13.652
and lit as a reminder
of the Spirit of Christmas.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.786
Every year like clockwork,
the trees came.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.389
[Kate]: So, a tradition,

34:17.422 --> 34:19.525
passed down from generation
to generation.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.293
[Millicent]: Oh, yes.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.362
[Kate]: Reporting
from Hollyvale, North Dakota,

34:23.395 --> 34:24.530
I'm Kate Harper, NTN News.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.366
[applause]

34:40.879 --> 34:42.214
Kate...?

34:42.248 --> 34:43.415
Kate, wait a second.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.516
I know, I tightened
it up a little.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.185
Tightened it up?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.219
You took out the missing trees,
you took out the mystery,

34:48.254 --> 34:49.121
you took out
the heart of the story.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.722
No, I made sure the story
still had heart,

34:50.755 --> 34:51.690
because that's why we're here.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.623
Oh, right,

34:52.658 --> 34:54.426
"Kate Harper finds
her Christmas Spirit."

34:54.460 --> 34:55.427
Yeah, I know all about it--

34:55.460 --> 34:56.395
I don't think you do,

34:56.428 --> 34:57.763
which is why you're trying
to turn the story

34:57.796 --> 34:59.165
into some sort of
small town mystery.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.232
What?

35:00.266 --> 35:01.300
I think you're afraid

35:01.333 --> 35:02.334
that you're never going to
find the part of yourself

35:02.368 --> 35:04.603
that can feel something
as simple and genuine

35:04.636 --> 35:05.537
as the Christmas spirit.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.576
Sorry, Katie, I--

35:10.609 --> 35:11.610
I asked you
not to call me that.

35:11.643 --> 35:12.911
Why not?

35:12.944 --> 35:13.679
Because that's what
you used to call me

35:13.712 --> 35:15.447
when I loved you
and you loved me,

35:15.481 --> 35:16.882
and that was a long time ago.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.784
I did ask you
to come to Vermont.

35:18.817 --> 35:19.918
-I had a job.
-So did I.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.153
And then you got a wife.

35:21.187 --> 35:21.987
I moved on.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.355
I never thought
I'd see you again.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.823
Well, here we are.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.293
[cell phone rings]

35:30.696 --> 35:31.897
It's Lauren.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.766
Hello.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.502
Yeah.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.537
Thanks.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.474
No, yeah,
I'll tell her.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.842
Bye.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.712
She loved the show.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.282
You're a good producer, Jack.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.350
Kate, I--

35:51.383 --> 35:52.418
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.885
What? You can't, it's like
the North Pole out here.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.955
Well, then maybe I'll find
my Christmas Spirit.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.825
North Pole. Get it?

35:59.858 --> 36:01.460
Go inside, Jack.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.728
I'll be fine.

36:10.869 --> 36:14.406
[***]

36:18.544 --> 36:20.746
* ...It's everywhere you go

36:20.779 --> 36:25.617
* Each smile is filled
with Christmas cheer *

36:25.651 --> 36:30.289
* The children laugh and play
on this very special day *

36:30.322 --> 36:35.327
* That day is finally here

36:35.361 --> 36:38.764
* Sleigh bells and snow
and rosy cheeks aglow... *

36:42.768 --> 36:45.837
[***]

36:45.871 --> 36:47.739
Hi. I'm Kate Harper,

36:47.773 --> 36:51.343
reporting for NTN news
from Hollyvale, North Dakota,

36:51.377 --> 36:53.945
the biggest little
Christmas town in the country.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.481
Okay, so,

36:55.514 --> 36:57.283
once the wire hangers
are coiled tight,

36:57.316 --> 36:58.884
you can start wrapping
the evergreen branches,

36:58.917 --> 37:00.619
under and over,
nice and gently

37:00.652 --> 37:01.987
all the way
around the circle...

37:02.020 --> 37:03.722
For those of you at home,
this is a wonderful way

37:03.755 --> 37:05.591
to start your
Christmas season.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.394
Then you can just attach
with the glue gun?

37:08.427 --> 37:09.328
Pop it right on top.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.629
Look at that beautiful
snowflake, folks.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.897
This is just gorgeous.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.366
[Kate]: These are beautiful.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.002
I can't believe
you made these all by hand.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.838
Amazing. Amazing stuff
here in Hollyvale...

37:19.871 --> 37:22.007
You know, my mother
had a secret ingredient

37:22.040 --> 37:23.609
when it came to decorating
gingerbread houses.

37:23.642 --> 37:24.643
And what was that?

37:26.978 --> 37:29.648
Always add
just a sprinkling...

37:29.681 --> 37:30.649
of love.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.758
And cut.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.432
...You know, my mother
had a secret ingredient

37:46.465 --> 37:48.500
when it came to decorating
gingerbread houses.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.935
Always add
just a sprinkling...

37:49.968 --> 37:52.938
of love.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.723
[clears throat awkwardly]

38:11.757 --> 38:14.860
What I'm looking for, Doug,
is beauty shots of the town.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.995
Uh, Christmas decorations,

38:17.028 --> 38:19.398
happy people,
things like that.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.799
Okay.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.969
Hey, what about this?

38:24.002 --> 38:25.003
What are
all those notes?

38:26.472 --> 38:28.340
Well, this is
the Christmas Wishing Tree.

38:28.374 --> 38:30.876
What's the Christmas
Wishing Tree?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.411
Well, for families
who don't have a lot,

38:32.444 --> 38:33.612
they wish for
something for Christmas,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.013
and they put it
on the tree.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.582
Then someone else
from the town,

38:36.615 --> 38:38.450
if they're feeling
the Christmas spirit,

38:38.484 --> 38:40.986
they take the wish
and make it come true.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.955
Wow, that's really beautiful.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.857
Yeah. At least we've got
one tradition left.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.594
What do you think, Doug?

38:48.627 --> 38:49.828
About what?

38:49.861 --> 38:51.497
The Hollis tree.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.832
Why did they stop sending them?

38:53.865 --> 38:55.934
Well, it beats me.

38:55.967 --> 38:56.935
Hmm...

38:56.968 --> 38:58.404
Anyway, uh...

38:58.437 --> 38:59.738
I've got to
get back to work,

38:59.771 --> 39:00.972
so I'll see you
later, okay?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.007
Thanks, Doug.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.675
See you later.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.351
[***]

39:40.045 --> 39:41.379
[door closes]

39:46.618 --> 39:48.053
Ted...

39:48.086 --> 39:49.087
Oh, hello, Doug.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.188
Beautiful day.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.757
Uh, yeah, nice.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.625
About the Hollis
Christmas tree thing,

39:53.659 --> 39:54.660
I--

39:54.693 --> 39:55.794
Look...

39:55.827 --> 39:58.664
This is not exactly the place
to be discussing this.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.131
I know.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.534
The thing is, it's Ms. Harper,

40:02.568 --> 40:04.870
she's... very nice, you know?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.838
I feel a little uncomfortable
lying to her.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.675
We discussed this, Doug.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.942
It's not lying.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.679
Think of it as a legend.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.914
A story we tell each other
around the holidays.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.449
That's all.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.383
Yeah, I know, but--

40:18.416 --> 40:20.786
Look, do you want
to do the right thing

40:20.819 --> 40:22.754
for Hollyvale?

40:22.788 --> 40:23.789
Of course.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.156
Okay then.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.192
Just keep it up
a little bit longer.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.560
Can you do that?

40:28.594 --> 40:30.496
I guess so.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.597
Good.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.832
On behalf of
the whole town,

40:33.865 --> 40:34.833
I thank you.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.935
Merry Christmas.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.804
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.665
No one there by that name?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.166
Okay.
Sorry to bother you.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.668
Bye.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.871
Mia, have you
seen Kate?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.540
Oh, yeah, Ms. Harper
asked me to tell you

41:14.573 --> 41:15.641
that she'd meet you
at the mayor's office

41:15.674 --> 41:16.608
for his interview.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.009
Oh.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.978
Okay. Thanks.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.713
I'm kinda following
a lead myself.

41:21.747 --> 41:22.814
Really?

41:22.848 --> 41:23.815
Working on a story?

41:23.849 --> 41:24.983
Yeah. Ms. Harper asked me

41:25.016 --> 41:25.984
to call every Hollis
in the county,

41:26.017 --> 41:27.786
and ask for Vernon.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.621
Vernon Hollis.

41:29.655 --> 41:30.889
How's that going?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.824
No luck so far,
but I'm gonna stay on it.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.125
That's what we journalists do.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.594
Right.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.663
Okay. Thanks.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.901
[Kate]: Ted, thank you for
taking the time to talk to us.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.302
My pleasure.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.137
I hope you don't mind

41:46.171 --> 41:47.105
if Charlie keeps working
back there?

41:48.740 --> 41:49.808
We kind of overdid it
with the Christmas lights,

41:49.841 --> 41:51.577
and blew an outlet.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.078
No problem.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.180
We're all set, Jack.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.181
Okay.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.916
Kate?

41:57.949 --> 41:59.685
I'm ready.

41:59.718 --> 42:03.021
All right,
and roll cameras.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.756
Rolling.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.291
And... action.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.093
Mayor Drysdale, let me
just start by saying

42:08.126 --> 42:09.227
you have a lovely town.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.195
Well, thank you.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.830
We're pretty
proud of it.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.565
When you walk along the streets
of Hollyvale,

42:13.599 --> 42:14.866
and talk to the people,

42:14.900 --> 42:16.768
it really does
feel like Christmas.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.036
"The biggest little
Christmas town

42:18.069 --> 42:19.337
in the country."

42:19.370 --> 42:22.240
And with Christmas being such
an important part of this town,

42:22.273 --> 42:24.075
you have to wonder

42:24.109 --> 42:26.578
why the Hollis family
stopped giving Christmas trees

42:26.612 --> 42:27.779
to Hollyvale.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.715
Wait, what?

42:29.748 --> 42:31.049
Well, it's been
a tradition

42:31.082 --> 42:31.950
for so many generations,

42:31.983 --> 42:36.054
but two years ago,
it suddenly stopped.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.255
[stammers] Uh...

42:37.288 --> 42:38.924
You said we were
gonna talk

42:38.957 --> 42:40.058
about the town?

42:40.091 --> 42:41.126
Two years ago,

42:41.159 --> 42:42.160
which was
also the year

42:42.193 --> 42:44.062
that you became Mayor,
wasn't it?

42:44.095 --> 42:45.631
Uh, that's right,

42:45.664 --> 42:47.799
but it-it's got
nothing... nothing...

42:47.833 --> 42:49.234
So, are you saying
it's a coincidence

42:49.267 --> 42:51.703
that the trees stopped coming
after your election?

42:51.737 --> 42:52.971
Uh...

42:53.004 --> 42:54.673
absolutely. Of course.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.808
And you have no idea
the reason?

42:57.909 --> 42:58.944
[gasps, stammering]

42:58.977 --> 43:00.746
I'm gonna have to
cut this short.

43:00.779 --> 43:03.081
I-I... I have just been called

43:03.114 --> 43:04.215
to an emergency
town council meeting.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.150
Mr. Mayor, if--

43:05.183 --> 43:07.853
You folks,
enjoy the rest of your visit,

43:07.886 --> 43:10.388
and if you have
any more questions, um...

43:10.421 --> 43:11.990
[sighs]

43:12.023 --> 43:13.992
And... cut.

43:14.025 --> 43:15.961
What was that?

43:15.994 --> 43:17.228
I know.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.964
Did you see the look
on his face?

43:18.997 --> 43:21.332
Not him. You.

43:21.366 --> 43:22.968
What's with
the Nancy Drew routine?

43:23.001 --> 43:24.069
This interview was going to
be the centerpiece

43:24.102 --> 43:25.170
of tonight's segment.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.405
There's something going on
with those trees, Jack.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.275
Don't get me started
on those trees.

43:30.308 --> 43:31.342
Excuse me?

43:31.376 --> 43:33.679
Huge pain in the neck
to put up.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.113
Do you know where
they came from?

43:35.146 --> 43:36.381
Uh...

43:36.414 --> 43:37.716
Not off-hand,

43:37.749 --> 43:39.050
but there was probably
an address

43:39.084 --> 43:40.318
on the shipping papers.

43:40.351 --> 43:42.287
The shipping papers?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.222
Yeah, they're in the files,
out at the town's warehouse.

43:44.255 --> 43:46.091
They store a lot of
stuff out there.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.359
Like the Christmas float we use

43:48.393 --> 43:49.394
to drive Santa
into the town

43:49.427 --> 43:50.896
Christmas Eve?

43:50.929 --> 43:52.864
Kids love that.

43:52.898 --> 43:55.767
Oh, I'd love to get
that Santa float on camera.

43:55.801 --> 43:56.835
Kate...

43:56.868 --> 43:57.836
What do you
say, Jack?

43:57.869 --> 43:59.938
Maybe we could
interview Charlie

43:59.971 --> 44:00.939
for tonight's segment?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.342
You want to interview me?

44:05.944 --> 44:07.813
Mm-hmm.

44:07.846 --> 44:09.781
We sure do.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.021
[***]

44:22.728 --> 44:25.196
Well, here we are.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.866
Wow, it's perfect.

44:30.235 --> 44:33.004
Yeah, we can cover
the whole Main Street with this.

44:33.038 --> 44:34.906
Wow.

44:36.407 --> 44:37.909
Uh, Doug, why don't
you set up up top?

44:37.943 --> 44:39.444
We can shoot
the chair that way.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.747
And, uh, why don't you guys help
Charlie get settled?

44:41.780 --> 44:42.948
I will look for
a bathroom

44:42.981 --> 44:44.149
to check my makeup.

44:44.182 --> 44:45.717
Oh, it's in the office.

44:45.751 --> 44:47.185
Right there
by the front door.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.419
Oh, in the office.

44:48.453 --> 44:49.755
Thank you, Charlie.

44:49.788 --> 44:52.157
I think your makeup
looks just fine.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.224
I'll just be a sec.

44:54.860 --> 44:58.797
Just get in the chair, Charlie,
we'll shoot you there.

44:58.830 --> 45:00.832
[***]

45:28.927 --> 45:30.328
Okay, okay,

45:30.361 --> 45:32.063
so just give me
a sound check?

45:32.097 --> 45:32.998
A what?

45:33.031 --> 45:35.333
Just count to 10.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.068
Twice.

45:37.102 --> 45:40.305
One, two...

46:07.098 --> 46:08.900
[shutter clicks]

46:18.076 --> 46:19.344
[bells clattering]

46:21.246 --> 46:23.114
What was that?

46:23.148 --> 46:24.515
What?

46:24.549 --> 46:26.151
I didn't hear
anything.

46:26.184 --> 46:28.353
Sounds like it's coming
from the office.

46:28.386 --> 46:29.354
I'd better go check.

46:34.525 --> 46:36.194
Probably just mice!

46:36.227 --> 46:38.529
Looking for warmth...

46:41.299 --> 46:42.333
Hmm.

47:04.489 --> 47:07.258
[Kate]: Charlie?

47:14.933 --> 47:15.833
Whenever you're ready.

47:18.303 --> 47:22.240
[wind gusting and howling]

47:22.273 --> 47:25.543
[sighs] The number's
no longer in service.

47:25.576 --> 47:27.879
Well, at least
I have an address.

47:27.913 --> 47:30.281
Are we gonna be arrested?

47:30.315 --> 47:32.650
Because when I took this gig,

47:32.683 --> 47:35.220
nobody said anything
about being arrested.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.555
No. We had permission
to be there.

47:37.588 --> 47:39.224
And technically,
I didn't steal anything.

47:39.257 --> 47:41.292
I just took a couple
of pictures, so--

47:41.326 --> 47:42.460
All right, that's it.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.238
Jack...

47:53.271 --> 47:55.273
Jack, what's wrong?

47:55.306 --> 47:56.307
What's wrong?

47:56.341 --> 47:58.309
We talked about this, Kate.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.410
About what we're doing up here?

47:59.444 --> 48:00.445
About keeping our jobs?

48:00.478 --> 48:01.446
Ring any bells?

48:01.479 --> 48:02.647
You saw the way

48:02.680 --> 48:04.415
the mayor practically ran
out of his office?

48:04.449 --> 48:05.984
Are you telling me you're not
the least bit curious?

48:06.017 --> 48:07.452
That's not the point.

48:07.485 --> 48:08.453
We drive all the way to...

48:09.955 --> 48:10.688
I don't even know
what we were doing

48:10.721 --> 48:11.990
at that warehouse.

48:12.023 --> 48:14.059
And now we have maybe
three hours

48:14.092 --> 48:15.093
to get Lauren the show...

48:15.126 --> 48:16.127
tonight...

48:16.161 --> 48:17.328
What?

48:17.362 --> 48:18.563
You're smiling.

48:18.596 --> 48:19.464
Something about this
amuses you?

48:19.497 --> 48:20.598
No.

48:20.631 --> 48:22.300
Yeah. I don't--
I don't know.

48:22.333 --> 48:23.468
I mean, Jack,
nobody twisted your arm.

48:23.501 --> 48:24.435
What?

48:24.469 --> 48:25.570
Oh, come on.

48:25.603 --> 48:27.205
If you wanted to stop
the interview with the Mayor,

48:27.238 --> 48:28.639
you could've at any time.

48:28.673 --> 48:30.208
And if you didn't want
to drive out here,

48:30.241 --> 48:31.642
you should have
just said so.

48:31.676 --> 48:33.411
Admit it.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.080
You wanna find out
what's happening, too.

48:35.113 --> 48:36.147
You used to drive me nuts
with this stuff.

48:36.181 --> 48:37.048
What?

48:37.082 --> 48:38.283
Back in school!

48:38.316 --> 48:40.318
You'd get a hold of,
like, a story,

48:40.351 --> 48:41.419
or a lead,

48:41.452 --> 48:43.321
and you wouldn't let go,
no matter what,

48:43.354 --> 48:44.355
until you'd taken it

48:44.389 --> 48:45.490
as far as
you possibly could.

48:49.227 --> 48:51.229
You made me crazy.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.564
I thought that was
part of my charm.

48:56.234 --> 48:58.036
But we still owe Lauren a show.

49:02.107 --> 49:03.041
Jack...

49:04.109 --> 49:05.243
Look.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.477
Get the camera.

49:08.146 --> 49:10.481
[sighs in wonder]

49:13.218 --> 49:15.086
For 2,000 years,

49:15.120 --> 49:17.188
people have celebrated Christmas
with lights on their trees,

49:17.222 --> 49:19.690
mantels and homes.

49:19.724 --> 49:21.559
Just about anywhere
you can light a candle

49:21.592 --> 49:23.995
or flip a switch.

49:24.029 --> 49:28.566
Our Christmas lights come in
all sizes, shapes, and colors.

49:28.599 --> 49:31.536
But every now and then,
we're reminded

49:31.569 --> 49:35.273
that the Spirit of Christmas
has a very special light

49:35.306 --> 49:37.108
all its own.

49:37.142 --> 49:40.045
A light that, if you're
lucky enough to see it,

49:40.078 --> 49:41.512
even once,

49:41.546 --> 49:43.514
stays with you forever.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.355
Reporting from Hollyvale,
North Dakota,

49:50.388 --> 49:54.325
I'm Kate Harper
for NTN News.

49:54.359 --> 49:56.294
[applause]

50:26.191 --> 50:27.658
[knock on door]

50:29.760 --> 50:31.496
[persistent knock]

50:35.100 --> 50:36.734
Good morning.

50:36.767 --> 50:38.236
Parking lot.

50:38.269 --> 50:39.404
30 minutes.

50:39.437 --> 50:40.671
Oh.

50:40.705 --> 50:42.273
Okay.

50:45.843 --> 50:48.146
Uh, you look great
in the morning,

50:48.179 --> 50:49.314
by the way.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.787
[***]

51:02.860 --> 51:04.829
I still think we should
have brought Doug.

51:04.862 --> 51:06.631
If this Hollis guy is
staying off the grid,

51:06.664 --> 51:07.632
I think the last thing
we should do

51:07.665 --> 51:08.566
is show up with a bunch
of camera equipment.

51:08.599 --> 51:11.402
Why would somebody
from a successful family

51:11.436 --> 51:13.304
want to cut himself off
from the world?

51:13.338 --> 51:16.374
Maybe Christmas trees
is just the tip of the iceberg.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.176
You're getting into this,
aren't you?

51:18.209 --> 51:19.777
No.

51:19.810 --> 51:21.512
Just as long as we have
something to give to Lauren

51:21.546 --> 51:22.480
to put on air
by the end of the day,

51:22.513 --> 51:24.649
then... I'm good.

51:24.682 --> 51:25.783
How we doing?

51:25.816 --> 51:27.718
Oh, it says, um...

51:27.752 --> 51:30.788
yup, stay on this road
for 22 miles.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.260
Yeah.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.262
I'm kinda getting into it.

51:47.472 --> 51:48.439
There's nothing
out here.

51:48.473 --> 51:49.707
You sure
this is right?

51:49.740 --> 51:52.377
No, yeah,
it says right here.

51:53.411 --> 51:55.646
Oh, no.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.648
I think we just lost
the signal.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.584
You think?

51:59.617 --> 52:01.386
No.

52:01.419 --> 52:04.222
We definitely lost the signal.

52:04.255 --> 52:05.423
Oh.

52:06.691 --> 52:07.858
Anything?

52:07.892 --> 52:10.328
No. You?

52:10.361 --> 52:12.163
No.

52:13.431 --> 52:14.532
How far do you think
we were from the house?

52:14.565 --> 52:15.666
I don't know.

52:15.700 --> 52:18.236
There were big stretches
of emptiness on the screen.

52:18.269 --> 52:20.205
Did it look
anything like this?

52:20.238 --> 52:22.207
Okay, fine.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.509
Maybe we should
go back.

52:24.542 --> 52:26.677
Do you remember the way?

52:26.711 --> 52:28.246
Yes, of course.

52:28.279 --> 52:30.681
Probably. I think.

52:30.715 --> 52:32.217
Good enough.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.754
[gasping and shivering]

52:36.787 --> 52:38.589
Oh, man...

52:38.623 --> 52:41.259
Oh, it's cold.

52:41.292 --> 52:42.460
[starter chugging]

52:44.962 --> 52:46.264
Oh...

52:46.297 --> 52:47.832
Okay.

52:47.865 --> 52:48.799
[starter chugging and whining]

52:48.833 --> 52:50.201
[sighs]

52:50.235 --> 52:51.902
I am so sorry, Jack, this is--

52:51.936 --> 52:53.003
-This isn't Siberia--
-This was a bad idea--

52:53.037 --> 52:53.838
-Lots of people live here--
-It was all my fault--

52:53.871 --> 52:54.705
I shouldn't have
talked you into this--

52:54.739 --> 52:56.341
Someone's gonna
come by any minute.

52:56.374 --> 52:58.643
I think I see smoke.

53:03.381 --> 53:04.682
Well, thanks
for the coat.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.584
It's very toasty.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.619
[chuckles]
You're welcome.

53:08.653 --> 53:10.788
I wonder what the temperature
in Honolulu is right now?

53:10.821 --> 53:12.457
Probably pretty nice.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.524
[shivering]

53:15.260 --> 53:16.461
Jack, look.

53:16.494 --> 53:17.628
I see it.

53:17.662 --> 53:18.763
I see lights.

53:18.796 --> 53:19.997
Maybe someone's home.

53:20.030 --> 53:21.632
Only one way
to find out.

53:21.666 --> 53:22.900
[shivering] Yeah.

53:30.408 --> 53:32.277
Wow. It's beautiful.

53:32.310 --> 53:33.244
Yeah.

53:33.278 --> 53:34.979
I don't see anybody.

53:35.012 --> 53:35.946
Try the door.

53:37.748 --> 53:38.949
We can't just walk in.

53:38.983 --> 53:40.385
This is
a nice coat, Jack,

53:40.418 --> 53:41.652
but I'm still starting
to freeze out here.

53:44.622 --> 53:45.923
It's locked.

53:54.899 --> 53:55.866
Hello?

53:55.900 --> 53:58.936
Anybody home?

54:00.805 --> 54:02.373
Our van wouldn't start.

54:02.407 --> 54:05.443
We just need to use
your phone, please.

54:06.711 --> 54:07.878
I'll look for
a land-line.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.419
[calling]
Hello!

54:17.655 --> 54:18.489
Uh, listen,
they left a fire going,

54:18.523 --> 54:19.524
so somebody's here.

54:19.557 --> 54:20.758
I'm going to check outside.

54:31.702 --> 54:33.538
Oh! Hi.

54:33.571 --> 54:35.973
Um... sorry.

54:36.006 --> 54:38.676
Can I-can I help you with that?

54:39.744 --> 54:41.546
No, I... I got it.

54:44.749 --> 54:47.051
Yeah, yeah, I...

54:47.084 --> 54:48.919
Kate?

54:56.961 --> 54:58.629
Now...

54:58.663 --> 54:59.664
you want to tell me

54:59.697 --> 55:00.865
what you're doing
inside my house?

55:00.898 --> 55:02.533
Yeah, uh...

55:02.567 --> 55:04.969
no, we had some, uh,
car trouble up the road.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.871
Oh, I'm sorry, it's my fault.

55:06.904 --> 55:08.639
I was cold.

55:10.074 --> 55:11.108
I've seen you before.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.010
I'm Kate Harper,

55:13.043 --> 55:14.412
and this is Jack Brewster.

55:14.445 --> 55:16.547
We're from
the NTN morning show.

55:16.581 --> 55:18.115
Again, I apologize

55:18.148 --> 55:19.784
for barging in like this.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.587
Oh... no harm done.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.790
You can help yourself
to the fire,

55:25.823 --> 55:28.793
and I'll get you
something warm to drink.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.060
Thank you.
Mr...?

55:30.094 --> 55:32.430
Hollis.

55:32.463 --> 55:33.798
Vernon Hollis.

55:37.602 --> 55:39.370
Yes, Ms. Foster,
I understand, but--

55:39.404 --> 55:41.739
No, I don't think you do...

55:41.772 --> 55:43.841
I've been calling
their cell phones all morning,

55:43.874 --> 55:46.477
and I haven't reached
either one of them.

55:46.511 --> 55:50.415
That is not acceptable.

55:50.448 --> 55:51.516
No, ma'am,
but that's the thing.

55:51.549 --> 55:52.783
Ms. Harper and Mr. Brewster
left early this morning,

55:52.817 --> 55:54.519
and they haven't come back yet.

55:54.552 --> 55:55.620
Left?
Where did they go?

55:55.653 --> 55:56.721
They didn't tell anybody.

55:56.754 --> 55:57.722
And there are still
parts of the area

55:57.755 --> 55:58.689
where cells phones don't work.

55:58.723 --> 55:59.957
Don't work?

55:59.990 --> 56:01.426
What kind of town
are you running up there?

56:01.459 --> 56:03.628
I'm not actually
in charge, so...

56:03.661 --> 56:05.596
What is your name?

56:05.630 --> 56:06.797
Mia. Mia Walker.

56:06.831 --> 56:07.932
I'm gonna be
a journalism student at--

56:07.965 --> 56:10.134
Well, Ms. Walker,
I want you to find them,

56:10.167 --> 56:11.035
and when you do,

56:11.068 --> 56:13.137
you tell them
to call me immediately.

56:13.170 --> 56:14.405
Do you understand?

56:14.439 --> 56:15.973
Absolutely, Ms. Foster.

56:16.006 --> 56:19.076
Don't worry, I am so on it.

56:23.180 --> 56:24.715
Well, it gets
so cold around here,

56:24.749 --> 56:26.150
you have to keep
the engine running

56:26.183 --> 56:29.654
to make sure that the car
doesn't freeze up.

56:29.687 --> 56:31.756
But I've got some jumper cables,
I'll get you squared away.

56:31.789 --> 56:34.759
Thank you,
we appreciate that.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.893
The main thing is
getting you back on the road

56:35.926 --> 56:37.528
before these clouds
get too close.

56:37.562 --> 56:39.597
Clouds?

56:39.630 --> 56:41.432
We have a snowstorm coming.

56:45.169 --> 56:46.437
These cookies are delicious.

56:46.471 --> 56:47.605
Did you make them?

56:47.638 --> 56:49.106
Yeah.
It's an old family recipe.

56:49.139 --> 56:50.941
Well, your home is lovely.

56:50.975 --> 56:53.778
It looks like something
out of a story.

56:53.811 --> 56:55.480
You live out here alone?

56:55.513 --> 56:58.683
Yeah, I kind of
prefer it that way.

56:58.716 --> 56:59.884
Peace and quiet.

57:01.051 --> 57:03.588
Something like that, yeah.

57:03.621 --> 57:04.789
Now, the real question is,

57:04.822 --> 57:07.725
what brings you folks
way out here?

57:12.797 --> 57:15.099
Actually...

57:15.132 --> 57:16.233
you do.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.102
Me?

57:18.135 --> 57:20.004
I'd like
to interview you.

57:20.037 --> 57:21.839
To be on television.

57:21.872 --> 57:23.741
Vernon,
we're doing

57:23.774 --> 57:25.643
a series of segments
on Hollyvale,

57:25.676 --> 57:28.546
what Christmas means to the town
and the people who live there.

57:28.579 --> 57:31.015
And you would like
to interview me

57:31.048 --> 57:32.817
about the Hollyvale
Christmas tree?

57:32.850 --> 57:35.853
Well, it was
a tradition for so long,

57:35.886 --> 57:37.755
and then, for no reason,

57:37.788 --> 57:39.657
you suddenly
stopped sending them.

57:40.858 --> 57:42.192
There's a reason.

57:44.529 --> 57:46.263
Does the Mayor
know the reason?

57:46.296 --> 57:47.965
Ted?

57:47.998 --> 57:49.233
When I asked him,

57:49.266 --> 57:50.568
he didn't want
to talk about it.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.603
Like the question
made him nervous.

57:54.772 --> 57:55.773
[sighs]

58:01.646 --> 58:02.713
Jack just said

58:02.747 --> 58:03.981
he needed the van
for a couple of hours.

58:04.014 --> 58:05.983
He didn't say
where he was going.

58:06.016 --> 58:07.918
Well, did he take
any of the equipment?

58:07.952 --> 58:10.020
No, just the van.

58:10.054 --> 58:10.955
Maybe they went for a drive,

58:10.988 --> 58:11.789
and stayed away longer
than they planned.

58:11.822 --> 58:12.990
They've got
a deadline, you know.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.825
Excuse me?

58:14.859 --> 58:15.993
They wouldn't just
take a drive.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.562
They're professionals.
They've got a story to deliver,

58:17.595 --> 58:19.229
and believe me, that's something

58:19.263 --> 58:20.698
we journalists
take seriously.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.700
We get a story,
we stick with it,

58:22.733 --> 58:24.001
and we don't go for a drive.

58:24.034 --> 58:25.202
All right, Mia.

58:25.235 --> 58:26.671
Where do you think
they got to?

58:26.704 --> 58:28.005
All I know is,

58:28.038 --> 58:28.773
Ms. Harper and Mr. Brewster
shouldn't be out there

58:28.806 --> 58:30.307
when that snowstorm
gets here.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.109
You can't let anything
happen to them, Robby.

58:32.142 --> 58:34.011
Don't worry, I'm gonna
talk to the Mayor

58:34.044 --> 58:36.246
and then I'm gonna
go look into it.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.616
Oh, you might want to
let the Mayor know

58:38.649 --> 58:41.686
that Kate's been looking into
that tree story real close.

58:49.694 --> 58:52.930
The Hollis family
and the Drysdale family

58:52.963 --> 58:54.699
moved out west together

58:54.732 --> 58:56.734
when the Dakotas
were still a territory.

58:56.767 --> 58:59.704
They settled
the town of Hollyvale,

58:59.737 --> 59:01.772
they helped
make it grow.

59:01.806 --> 59:03.574
In those years,

59:03.608 --> 59:06.076
they were about as close
as two families could be.

59:07.612 --> 59:09.947
Ted Drysdale is like
a brother to me.

59:09.980 --> 59:11.148
So then,

59:11.181 --> 59:12.316
why doesn't he want to
talk about the tree?

59:12.349 --> 59:14.284
Maybe because

59:14.318 --> 59:16.621
that's the only way
he doesn't have to admit

59:16.654 --> 59:17.822
that I let him down.

59:17.855 --> 59:19.624
I let
everybody down.

59:19.657 --> 59:20.758
I don't understand.

59:22.359 --> 59:23.661
We all grew up

59:23.694 --> 59:25.295
right here.

59:25.329 --> 59:28.599
Me, and Ted, and...

59:28.633 --> 59:31.301
a girl named Amanda Clark.

59:31.335 --> 59:34.739
We went to school together.

59:34.772 --> 59:37.107
I mean, we really
knew each other.

59:37.141 --> 59:39.243
That's why Ted always said

59:39.276 --> 59:40.611
that he knew

59:40.645 --> 59:42.680
long before anyone else

59:42.713 --> 59:44.081
that Amanda and I
would end up married.

59:44.114 --> 59:46.350
Ted...

59:46.383 --> 59:48.853
he was my Best Man.

59:48.886 --> 59:51.722
And I loved that girl.

59:51.756 --> 59:52.923
So much.

59:52.957 --> 59:55.292
And she loved Christmas.

59:55.325 --> 59:59.296
Especially that tree
that we put up every year.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.299
What happened?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.401
About three years ago,

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.670
we had just finished

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.004
putting up the Christmas tree,

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:09.006
and, um...

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:12.242
the whole town had come out
to celebrate,

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.410
decorate,

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.412
same as we did every year.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.648
Amanda called

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.249
and said that
she was on her way,

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.851
[chuckles fondly]

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:22.052
I'll never...

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.888
I'll never forget her voice.

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.956
You know, she was like
a little kid, you know?

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.725
She was
on her way there,

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:29.226
and, uh...

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:35.199
there was--
there was an accident.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:37.968
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.204
It was like something
broke inside of me,

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:44.842
and I just couldn't bear
to put the tree

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:47.177
and see it standing there,
all bright...

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:50.214
full of life.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:53.417
Not without her.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.756
So you stopped
sending the trees.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.794
I don't think that's
the kind of Christmas story

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:06.430
you want to put on television.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.778
And no one's heard from them
since they left this morning?

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.180
They're from Los Angeles, Ted.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.281
If they're lost,

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:25.215
and that storm
blows through here...

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.283
This is my fault.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.919
I never should have reached out
to Kate Harper.

01:01:28.953 --> 01:01:30.254
I thought
she could help the town.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.722
It has helped.

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.790
The people are watching us
on the news,

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.024
and they're starting
to come back.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.360
Not like this.
Not at Christmas.

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:40.330
Put out the word.
Let's get organized.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.365
We've got to find 'em, and fast.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:43.333
Sir.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.839
Okay... try it again.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.140
[engine starts]

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:51.175
[laughing in relief]

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.342
You did it!
Thank you!

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.148
Okay, you should be fine.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.917
Just keep it running,

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.019
and stay between the snowbanks,
huh?

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.520
Will do.
Thanks, Vernon.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.454
You folks
take care now.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:05.355
Vernon?

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.828
Those segments
we've been doing from Hollyvale?

01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:12.763
They're for
a specific purpose.

01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:14.799
Well, on my show, live,

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:18.002
I told millions of people
I didn't like Christmas.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.037
You may be the first person
we've met so far

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.471
who hasn't seen that show.

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:24.241
[Kate]: I never have
cared for Christmas,

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:25.542
but I love my job,

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.877
and to keep it,

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.078
I was prepared
to come here and pretend

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:30.948
that I somehow magically found
my Christmas spirit again.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.282
Why are you telling me this?

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:38.889
Because I realized that
you've never had to pretend,

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:41.125
and I think, even though
you're hurting inside,

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:42.993
you have a greater
love for Christmas

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:45.229
and more genuine
Christmas spirit

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.197
than anyone
I've ever met,

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:50.267
and I think it's a shame for you
to not share that spirit

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.503
with the town
your family helped build

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:56.140
by giving them that gift
of a Christmas tree.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:57.875
I'm asking you,

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:59.543
what would Amanda feel

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:01.011
if she knew you were taking
so much joy away

01:03:01.045 --> 01:03:03.313
from so many people

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:04.281
because of her?

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:10.154
Vernon, what better way
to honor her memory?

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:13.157
We should get ahead
of the storm.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.102
Missing?
What do you mean, missing?

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.303
[Mia, on phone]:
But don't worry.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:26.770
The sheriff's putting together
the search team

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.172
right now.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.307
A search team?

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.575
This is terrible!

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.410
No, hey, they're really good
at finding people.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.212
[Lauren]: Yes, yes, yes,
I'm sure.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.247
I'm talking about
this is the kind of thing

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:38.415
we need right now.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:39.416
Excuse me?

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.451
Sympathy.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.087
For Kate.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.321
When word gets out

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.924
that she's lost in a storm
in the middle of Christmasland,

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.258
all will be forgiven,

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:51.128
but how am I supposed
to get a reporter up there

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.097
in time to cover the story?

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.100
Um... Ms. Foster?

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.301
I have an idea.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.938
Anything yet?

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:02.072
[Kate]: No.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.573
No signal.

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:06.643
Well, Lauren's just going
to have to understand.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.913
I mean, the guy didn't want
to be interviewed.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.014
There's nothing we can do
about that.

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.248
Right? What do you think?

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:14.885
Kate?

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:15.953
You okay?

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:18.588
You know,
Vernon has me thinking.

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:19.589
There are things in my life

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.959
that I've been holding onto
for way too long.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:24.995
I don't understand.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.364
When I was seven years old,

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:28.432
my father gave me a doll
for Christmas.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.168
I wanted that doll
so much.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.203
I thought I was the luckiest
little girl on earth,

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:34.438
and I knew
he was the best father

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:36.040
anyone could ever have...

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:40.177
and then he was gone.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.479
He left my mother and me.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:45.115
I'd hear from him
sometimes after that...

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:48.318
birthday cards,
phone calls,

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:51.588
but that was the last Christmas
we ever spent together,

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:54.658
and nothing felt the same
after that.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.962
Nothing was the same.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:04:59.496
Do you still hear from him?

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:02.066
Every Christmas now,
he sends a letter,

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:03.533
telling me
how much he loves me,

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:04.534
and how proud he is,

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:07.071
and that he would like
to be back in my life.

01:05:10.174 --> 01:05:11.308
What do you say?

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:14.611
Nothing.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:18.282
I don't answer.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:20.117
If you did...

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:23.387
what would you say?

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:33.897
Good evening.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.733
We have breaking news
tonight out of North Dakota.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.104
Morning Show host Kate Harper
and her producer, Jack Brewster,

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.638
have been reported missing.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.508
We take you now live
to Hollyvale, North Dakota,

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:47.511
where our reporter
is standing by with details.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:48.645
Thank you, Paul.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.480
We're here
at Hollyvale Town Hall,

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.349
where a large group
of volunteers have gathered

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.685
in order to help find NTN's
Kate Harper and Jack Brewster,

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.687
but with a serious
winter storm on the way,

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:00.657
and snow accumulation predicted
to reach up to 10 inches,

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.160
the search team knows
that time is of the essence.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.600
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see Hollyvale.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.136
Ooh, we got service.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.170
We should call Lauren.

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:14.104
Well, what do we say?

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.706
What's going on up there?

01:06:23.047 --> 01:06:24.648
She was very nice,

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:27.084
and she took
a real interest in our town.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.453
I just hope
we can find both of them safely.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.720
Thank you,
Mrs. Aberdeen.

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.425
Ms. Harper?
Mr. Brewster?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.593
You're all right!

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.029
They're here!
They're all right!

01:06:39.063 --> 01:06:40.097
[Jack]: Yeah, we're...

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.098
we're...

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.399
oh, hey!

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:43.533
[laughs]

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:45.235
Oh, Millicent, hi!

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:47.237
[excited chatter]

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:49.073
A new development
in tonight's story

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.574
in Hollyvale, North Dakota.

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.242
Kate Harper and Jack Brewster

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:53.743
have been found
safe and unharmed!

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.045
More details to follow!

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:55.779
Back to you, Paul!

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.553
Hello, Katherine.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.791
Dad.

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:15.799
We can go over here
and talk.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:17.167
Are you all right?

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.436
I'm fine.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:22.306
When they said
you were missing, the storm,

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:24.174
I was afraid I'd waited
too long to do this.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:27.744
What are you doing, exactly?

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.113
I wanted to see you.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:31.848
Why?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.083
We don't even know each other.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:36.453
I came to say I'm sorry.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.755
You said that in your letters.

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:42.692
Why come all this way
to apologize now?

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.461
I saw your show.

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.564
I heard what you said about...

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:50.400
how you don't like Christmas,

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.536
and I knew
I'd done that to you.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.838
Don't feel sorry for me.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.273
That's not it.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:59.509
I can't give you
those years back, Katherine.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:02.379
I'm so sorry for that,

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.249
but you came here to find
your Christmas spirit.

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:07.651
Maybe in some small way...

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:10.487
maybe I can help you do that?

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.056
Give back a little bit
of what I took from you?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.495
I wish you could.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.238
Kate?

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:37.247
* Silent night

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:42.618
* Holy night

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:46.790
* All is calm...

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.459
Deciding what you're going
to ask Santa to bring you

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:51.895
for Christmas?

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.798
I don't think Santa would be
too happy with me right now.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.205
Your father?

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.642
Came from a long way.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.676
So that's good.

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:13.250
Half my life, I imagined
getting a hug from my father

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.917
on Christmas.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.587
I still sometimes wonder
what that would feel like.

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:23.292
Probably feel
pretty good.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.497
I wanted to move
to Vermont.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.899
I wanted to be
with you, Jack,

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:32.902
more than anything...

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.404
but I couldn't
because I...

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:39.209
I had to know that
I could take care of myself.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.510
I had to make sure

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:43.412
that if...
anything ever happened,

01:09:43.447 --> 01:09:46.182
that no one could ever hurt me
the way that he did.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.219
I would never hurt you.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.590
Kate...

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.226
I love you.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.827
I never stopped.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:04.401
Jack...

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:07.437
we can't do this.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:09.706
Why not?

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:10.640
Because you were
right about me.

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:15.479
I've lost something
really important.

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.514
Trust me, Jack.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.484
The last thing you want to do
is spend Christmas with me.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.520
So what do we do now?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.392
We do the show tomorrow.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.359
We go home.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:30.894
We get back to work,
just like it was before.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.569
Just like it was before.

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:52.549
* Fa la la la la
La la la la *

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:56.620
* Strike the harp
and join the chorus *

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:59.923
* Fa la la la la
La la la la *

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:04.461
* Follow me in merry measure

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:05.829
* Fa la la, la la la
La la la... *

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.464
Bourbon, old-fashioned.

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:15.939
Can I ask you something?

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.008
What's that?

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.810
Do you think
there's such a thing

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:22.812
as the Christmas Spirit?

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.014
Sure.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:31.421
If you had the chance
to prove to someone

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:34.591
that it was real,

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.361
and it would change
their life...

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:41.431
would you do it?

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.067
In a heartbeat.

01:11:58.582 --> 01:11:59.783
Jack.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.418
Brewster.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.352
Michael Harper.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:05.321
You look familiar.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.758
I've been in love
with your daughter

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.394
for most of my life.

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:17.667
[***]

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:52.569
Jack?

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:06.950
[Mia]: Good morning,
Ms. Harper!

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.084
Mia, what's going on?

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.486
Christmas!

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:12.689
Have you seen
Jack this morning?

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:13.623
No, sorry.

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:24.133
[Mitzi]:
Good morning, Kate!

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.735
Mitzi, what's going on?

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:26.970
Where did all these
people come from?

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.473
You don't know?

01:13:29.506 --> 01:13:30.740
Thank you!

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:31.908
Oh...

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:34.444
Wait, is Jack here?

01:13:34.478 --> 01:13:35.845
I haven't seen him.

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.897
[Mayor]: Kate!

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.765
There you are!
I've been looking for you.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.967
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

01:13:58.001 --> 01:13:59.002
Yes, I'm fine.

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:00.203
Ted, what's going on here?

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:01.938
That's the reason
I wanted to talk to you...

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:02.972
to thank you.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:04.140
Thank me for what?

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.642
We're pretty proud of our town,

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.611
of the Christmas spirit
we have here,

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:08.945
but we also know it sounds

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:10.780
a little old-fashioned
these days.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.949
The "biggest little
Christmas town"

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.585
isn't exactly a draw
in the digital age.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:17.020
Well, it's a lovely town.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:19.088
And you made sure
to let them know that.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.225
These people are here
because of you, Kate.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:24.594
You showed them Hollyvale
in all its Christmas glory,

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:25.862
and they came to see
for themselves.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.764
Thank you.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.799
Oh, you're welcome.

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:32.068
Uh...
I also owe you an apology.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.605
I put you and Jack
in danger yesterday,

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:38.007
and that was wrong.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:39.242
Oh, it's not your fault

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:41.210
we almost got caught
in a snowstorm.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.713
That may not be
entirely accurate.

01:14:43.747 --> 01:14:45.081
I don't understand.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:47.751
Well, you see,
there was another reason

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:49.252
we wanted you to come out
to Hollyvale.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:51.888
We were worried
about a friend of ours.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.925
You two were
kind of in the same boat.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.695
You both lost
your Christmas spirit.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:00.229
You mean Vernon Hollis?

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:01.064
I guess we hoped that,

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:04.267
with you coming out here
all gung ho

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.770
to find your Christmas Spirit,

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:09.005
that maybe we could get you
out there to talk to Vernon,

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.740
you would stir something up
in him again,

01:15:10.774 --> 01:15:15.311
the way he was
before he lost Amanda.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.146
You mean this whole "mystery,"

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.248
the tree, Millicent,
the warehouse...

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:20.650
that was all for my benefit?

01:15:21.885 --> 01:15:23.853
We're all big fans
of yours, Kate.

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:26.289
We knew
you had a nose for news.

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:29.559
but it kind of went
awry yesterday,

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:32.662
and for that,
I apologize.

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:34.631
Now, I hope
you'll understand...

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:35.565
we miss our tree...

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.335
but we miss our friend
a whole lot more.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.639
We thought while you were
finding your Christmas Spirit,

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:45.308
you could help Vernon find his.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.843
No hard feelings?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.812
No.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.046
No hard feelings.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:51.047
Unfortunately,
things did not...

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.216
Morning, Kate!

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:54.751
Doug! Is Jack with you?

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:56.986
Nope, but there's
something you should see.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.087
Both of you.

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:07.897
Guys, start unwrapping
from the top and...

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:10.299
Of course,
be careful of the bow, okay?

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.267
Vernon!

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:13.737
Morning.

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:17.774
It's perfect.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.876
I think she
would've liked it.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.079
Very much.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.048
I'm sure she would've.

01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:30.987
[***]

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:36.192
Vernon.

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:38.995
Ted.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.998
[Mayor]:
That's a fine tree.

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.101
Merry Christmas.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:49.673
Merry Christmas, Ted.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:54.878
[phone rings]

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.348
Hello, Lauren.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:00.917
Kate!

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.687
Last night's news cast
was a smash!

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.322
The audience loves you again,
and they want more Kate Harper!

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.692
Oh, that's great news.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.727
[Lauren]:
And I've got even better news.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.064
The network wants to do
tonight's segment live.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:16.165
-Live?
-Uh-huh.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.134
It's the big finale,

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.202
so I hope you two have
something special planned

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:20.837
for Christmas Eve.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.238
Good luck!

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:23.907
Uh...

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.408
[sighs]

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:29.746
Yeah.

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.114
Good luck.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.184
Jack...

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:40.724
[***]

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:54.403
[sighs]

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:55.705
Still no sign
of Mr. Brewster?

01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:56.806
Apparently, Mr. Brewster

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.942
has decided to spend
Christmas Eve somewhere else.

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:01.477
So what do we do now?

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.478
We do the show.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.980
But we're live.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.083
Mia, have you
learned anything yet

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.985
about producing live TV?

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.053
No.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.788
Well, you're about to.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.223
Cool!

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:18.762
And finally tonight,

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:21.230
something very special
for Christmas Eve.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:24.300
Coming to us live
from Hollyvale, North Dakota,

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.469
our final segment in the series
we call

01:18:26.502 --> 01:18:28.972
"Kate Harper Finds
Her Christmas Spirit."

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.174
Kate, are you there?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.441
Hi, Paul,
and Merry Christmas Eve

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:34.844
from Hollyvale, North Dakota!

01:18:34.878 --> 01:18:35.812
[cheering]

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.983
We're getting
a great shot of that tree, Kate.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:41.384
It looks beautiful.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.753
It is beautiful,
and it's very special.

01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:45.388
So tell us, Kate...

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:46.856
have you changed your mind
about Christmas?

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.225
Well, as everyone knows,

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:51.227
I said something silly
on the air last week.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.963
I said I didn't like Christmas,

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.298
although it wasn't silly
at the time

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:56.833
because I meant it,

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:59.235
but I was wrong.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:02.071
It's not that
I didn't like Christmas.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.472
I didn't know Christmas.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.875
I thought Christmas
was about pretty lights,

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:08.845
and shiny decorations,

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:10.046
presents,

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.915
and big Christmas trees
like the one behind me,

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:15.184
but what Christmas
is about,

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:18.788
the place to look if you want
to find your Christmas spirit,

01:19:18.822 --> 01:19:20.223
is with the people around you,

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.259
the people who love and care
about each other,

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:26.529
not just on Christmas
but every day of the year,

01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:28.497
and they might not always
get along,

01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:30.133
and they don't always agree,

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.335
but they're always there
for you...

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:35.371
even if they have to go
out in the cold and find you.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:41.510
My only regret

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:45.348
is that I didn't
figure this out sooner.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.851
There are a couple of people
who aren't here tonight

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.385
that I would like to...

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:52.956
Well, I'd like
another chance to show them

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:55.491
that Kate Harper
has found her Christmas spirit.

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:01.064
["Santa"]:
Ho-ho-ho!

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:02.198
Merry Christmas!

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.968
Ho-ho-ho!

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:06.235
And speaking
of Christmas spirit,

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:07.536
we have
a very special visitor.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:09.372
Doug, Mia, come on!

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:20.516
[Kate]: Jack?

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:24.020
Jack! I thought you left!

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.021
Never.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.192
It's Christmas.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:35.364
He brought the tree!

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:37.233
It's beautiful...

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:38.201
and now,

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:39.835
all you need
is Santa Claus.

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.440
Merry Christmas,
Katherine.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.243
Dad!

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:48.244
Kate.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:51.514
Would you give me
another chance?

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:55.151
I would like that.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.387
Thank you.

01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:00.123
Merry Christmas, Katie.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:04.093
I like the way that sounds.

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:08.631
[Mia]:
Ms. Harper?

01:21:08.664 --> 01:21:11.100
Ms. Harper,
we're... still live on the air.

01:21:11.134 --> 01:21:12.235
[crowd chuckles]

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.536
Oh.

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.404
Merry Christmas!

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:17.573
[crowd]: Merry Christmas!

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.242
[cheering]

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:20.443
[applause]

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.055
* Dashing through the snow

01:21:32.088 --> 01:21:35.191
* In a one-horse open sleigh

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:38.294
* O'er the fields we go

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:41.364
* We're laughing all the way

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:44.500
* Bells on bobtails ring

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:47.570
* They're making spirits
bright *

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:48.604
* Oh, what fun

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:50.706
* To laugh and sing

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.942
* A sleighing song tonight

01:21:52.976 --> 01:21:55.945
* Oh, Jingle bells

01:21:55.979 --> 01:21:57.113
* Jingle bells

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:59.148
* Jingle all the way *
