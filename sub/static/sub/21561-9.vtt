00:40.457 --> 00:41.873
We're ready, boyo.

00:42.723 --> 00:46.481
From Malta to the farms
of France, Russia, Iowa.

00:47.763 --> 00:49.059
Our own backyard.

00:51.088 --> 00:53.990
Our great gift to the world.

00:55.482 --> 00:56.923
I'm proud of you, Dad.

01:12.398 --> 01:14.991
The last transmission to the
prison island puts them here...

01:15.053 --> 01:17.538
165 nautical miles south of Malta.

01:17.580 --> 01:21.200
That means only 70 miles of
search area, thanks to Fletcher.

01:21.793 --> 01:24.369
Safe to say Vellek's still
traveling with the two warships

01:24.394 --> 01:25.854
that pursued us into the storm.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.342
Agreed. No way they'd leave
the flagship unprotected,

01:28.442 --> 01:29.882
especially with the seeds on board.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.248
They had a team on Kleos
just a few hours ago.

01:36.249 --> 01:39.373
That means Nathan James
is somewhere in this area.

01:39.374 --> 01:41.174
And if they intercepted our last broadcast,

01:41.254 --> 01:43.214
then they have a pretty
good idea of where we are.

01:43.569 --> 01:46.223
Question is, do they
know where we're headed?

01:48.055 --> 01:49.208
Giorgio, think.

01:49.462 --> 01:51.582
Do you remember if you
told Fletcher about Malta?

01:52.765 --> 01:54.031
I don't know.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.374
How much did you talk to this man?

01:56.506 --> 01:59.053
Enough to figure him out.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.296
And there's no way to know
whether the Nathan James

02:01.320 --> 02:03.640
actually heard whatever message
Fletcher was trying to send

02:03.720 --> 02:05.456
before we caught him.

02:07.648 --> 02:10.308
To state the obvious, this could be a trap.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.680
Fletcher risked his life to make that call.

02:13.636 --> 02:15.307
But it's also possible they set him up,

02:15.716 --> 02:18.134
let him get the message
out to lure us to Malta.

02:18.135 --> 02:19.715
The intel he provided adds up.

02:19.815 --> 02:21.935
Vellek's gonna need an
airfield to deliver his poison.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.435
Malta's got the closest one.

02:23.535 --> 02:25.755
Either way, best we operate

02:25.855 --> 02:27.835
on the assumption they know we're coming

02:28.282 --> 02:29.684
and they're ready for us.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.386
If they think we're headed
to Malta...

02:32.433 --> 02:33.933
chances are, they will, too.

02:34.032 --> 02:35.692
Which makes them easy to find.

02:36.032 --> 02:37.732
And three on one, we're unbeatable,

02:37.762 --> 02:39.222
even against an Arleigh Burke.

02:39.501 --> 02:42.016
We'll close from the south
and then take them by surprise.

02:42.087 --> 02:45.747
No. My father wanted those
seeds in Malta yesterday.

02:46.009 --> 02:47.389
We maintain course.

02:47.489 --> 02:50.102
Lucia, please. We have to do this my way.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.098
"Unbeatable," you said. "Three on one."

02:53.134 --> 02:55.234
Here, there... What
difference does it make?

02:55.575 --> 02:58.825
You'll do as my sister ordered
and continue on to Malta.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.753
You Velleks,

03:01.414 --> 03:04.774
always looking for a battle
with no idea how to fight one.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.319
Let me remind you, Stavros,

03:07.344 --> 03:09.336
that it was my father
who put you in charge.

03:09.374 --> 03:10.834
And you can easily be replaced.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.553
Greece doesn't eat until
the Velleks are happy.

03:21.886 --> 03:23.146
I have an idea.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.890
Look at that. He has an idea.

03:28.566 --> 03:29.866
Let's talk options.

03:29.966 --> 03:31.906
I suggest we do a high-speed run to Malta

03:32.006 --> 03:33.506
and tuck into the bay.

03:33.606 --> 03:35.582
When the Greeks make port,
we launch a small boat attack,

03:35.606 --> 03:37.286
determine which ship is carrying the seeds

03:37.326 --> 03:38.769
and sink the other two.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.528
There are fishing grounds in this area here

03:40.552 --> 03:41.768
that still see a lot of boat traffic.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.612
At EMCON, it shouldn't be hard to blend in,

03:43.712 --> 03:46.308
- get to Malta undetected.
- We'll never beat them to Malta.

03:46.464 --> 03:48.364
And if we did, we don't
know what kind of assets

03:48.464 --> 03:50.104
they have on the ground backing them up.

03:50.184 --> 03:51.360
We need to take 'em out at sea.

03:51.384 --> 03:53.144
A direct confrontation with three warships?

03:53.224 --> 03:55.200
- We wouldn't survive that battle.
- So we split 'em up,

03:55.224 --> 03:57.804
- take 'em out one at a time.
- Yeah, we feint.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.640
Let 'em know where we
are, then we disappear.

03:59.664 --> 04:01.760
When they send in a ship to
investigate, we take it out.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.705
Three on one becomes two on one.

04:03.823 --> 04:06.063
While the Nathan James
engages the other screening ship,

04:06.143 --> 04:07.803
Vulture team boards the flag ship,

04:08.237 --> 04:09.377
retrieves the package.

04:09.477 --> 04:10.958
So that's the plan then.

04:11.616 --> 04:14.444
We'll need eyes on those ships.
I'll get the helo in the air.

05:09.129 --> 05:10.706
This plan is ridiculous.

05:10.865 --> 05:12.365
This is not action. This is delay.

05:12.465 --> 05:13.805
This is cowardice.

05:13.905 --> 05:16.988
I need to get to Malta now. Now! Today!

05:17.168 --> 05:19.088
I worked it through with
Stavros, and tactically,

05:19.128 --> 05:20.613
this is our best course of action.

05:20.652 --> 05:23.168
We are just trying to
make it safe for you, Dad.

05:23.193 --> 05:26.093
Safe for me? You need to
keep me safe, Giorgio?

05:26.348 --> 05:28.648
Now? After all you've done to obstruct

05:28.748 --> 05:31.008
the salvation of the world, now it's time

05:31.108 --> 05:33.008
for you to think about
the safety of Daddy?

05:33.341 --> 05:35.568
Who are you?! Why are you speaking to me?!

05:35.593 --> 05:36.630
Dad!

05:37.452 --> 05:39.013
Dad, look...

05:41.849 --> 05:45.130
You know how much I want
this for the both of us.

05:45.537 --> 05:47.953
We're so close to getting what
you and I have been looking for

05:47.977 --> 05:49.477
since we lost Christos.

05:49.577 --> 05:52.037
This plan is the only way we
can finish what we started.

05:52.137 --> 05:53.997
But I need you to trust me.

05:57.577 --> 06:00.497
12 knots. No faster. Okay?

06:01.737 --> 06:02.786
And, Dad?

06:03.842 --> 06:05.692
Promise me you'll stay radio silent.

06:06.518 --> 06:08.106
Yes, yes. Fine.

06:11.683 --> 06:13.084
Giorgio, wait.

06:16.198 --> 06:17.198
Giorgio...

06:19.832 --> 06:22.252
Rarely are sons similar to their fathers.

06:22.552 --> 06:23.972
Most are worse.

06:24.638 --> 06:26.267
This is your last chance.

06:27.399 --> 06:28.615
Don't muck it up.

06:43.511 --> 06:45.625
Another day, another mission.

06:45.651 --> 06:46.991
Same day, another mission.

06:47.091 --> 06:49.391
Hey, saving the world's a full-time job.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.707
As soon as we isolate the seed ship,

06:51.807 --> 06:53.196
Vulture team is ready to move.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.799
Packing some serious firepower.

06:55.898 --> 06:57.554
LAMS are the safest
way to cripple that ship

06:57.578 --> 06:59.652
without sinking it,
and we need those seeds.

06:59.677 --> 07:03.002
Sasha, if Fletcher's alive,

07:03.171 --> 07:04.446
he's with Vellek.

07:04.889 --> 07:06.762
You'll have your chance
to get some answers.

07:09.209 --> 07:10.754
Air crew, listen up.

07:11.249 --> 07:13.509
Get those hellfires secured, Razor.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.466
It's time to start the
motors and spin the rotors.

07:15.490 --> 07:16.447
Roger that.

07:16.508 --> 07:18.669
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.478
Hey, Nolan.

07:20.689 --> 07:22.649
You know, if you're still
looking for a call sign,

07:23.719 --> 07:24.803
I got one for you...

07:24.856 --> 07:26.114
Cupid.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.005
'Cause you shot your arrow...

07:28.418 --> 07:29.729
right through Diaz's heart.

07:38.984 --> 07:42.077
I can't just sit here anymore.
My responsibilities, the crew...

07:42.102 --> 07:44.679
The crew can manage. Get
some air, play some cards.

07:44.758 --> 07:46.458
And if you want to, you can move a little,

07:46.558 --> 07:48.458
- but you are not going back on duty.
- Doc...

07:48.558 --> 07:50.338
You have a punctured lung, Master Chief.

07:50.909 --> 07:52.560
The risk of infection is too great.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.078
When can I go back to work?

08:00.508 --> 08:01.595
Time will tell.

08:04.478 --> 08:05.745
_

08:07.078 --> 08:10.298
_

08:11.066 --> 08:13.046
_

08:13.146 --> 08:15.566
_

08:19.529 --> 08:20.716
_

08:23.638 --> 08:26.497
Picking up something. Bearing 3-1-7.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.338
- Sounds like prop noise.
- Warship?

08:29.728 --> 08:32.138
Hard to tell from this distance, sir. Loud.

08:32.238 --> 08:33.578
Could be multiple.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.053
- Heading north.
- Toward Malta.

08:36.846 --> 08:38.688
It's Vellek. Has to be.

08:39.837 --> 08:42.328
We're a long way out to
be picking up prop noise

08:42.330 --> 08:44.250
from a strike group that
should be staying quiet.

08:44.329 --> 08:45.849
Could be from damage they incurred

08:45.929 --> 08:47.409
when they chased us into the storm.

08:47.489 --> 08:49.909
Still... awfully loud.

08:50.635 --> 08:52.371
Do you think it's a ploy to draw us out?

08:53.549 --> 08:54.582
I do.

08:54.804 --> 08:56.711
I think that's giving them too much credit.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.616
We'll know more when we
get eyes on those ships.

08:58.937 --> 09:00.113
Captain Meylan, notify the bridge

09:00.137 --> 09:02.917
- and get Sunshine that bearing.
- Roger that.

09:04.228 --> 09:06.271
Sooner or later, we gotta play our hand.

09:07.148 --> 09:08.737
Now's as good a time as any.

09:30.886 --> 09:31.909
What?

09:32.317 --> 09:34.057
Look at you, running a warship.

09:34.347 --> 09:35.870
- Oh.
- Three warships.

09:37.293 --> 09:39.049
Believe me, it wasn't my plan.

09:39.573 --> 09:40.903
It's really incredible.

09:41.679 --> 09:43.419
Not too long ago, all you cared about

09:43.444 --> 09:46.516
was being the first one to
drive Jon Lambdin's tractor.

09:49.518 --> 09:51.012
It was a nice tractor.

09:56.168 --> 09:59.268
Mother, this is Sunshine
transmitting via Hawklink.

09:59.368 --> 10:01.388
- Do you read?
- Loud and clear, Sunshine.

10:01.832 --> 10:04.031
Confirming secure
point-to-point transmission.

10:04.392 --> 10:06.412
Limit all further communication to Hawklink

10:06.512 --> 10:08.271
in order to maintain EMCON condition Alpha.

10:08.272 --> 10:09.332
We copy, Mother.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.160
Razor, confirm all
active radar systems off.

10:12.844 --> 10:14.951
Roger, Sunshine. Our nose is cold.

10:15.207 --> 10:16.808
Eyes peeled, Nolan.

10:16.871 --> 10:18.631
You see anything more
than the top of a mast,

10:18.655 --> 10:20.755
- we're too close.
- Yes, sir.

10:21.694 --> 10:23.834
Passive radar feed coming in from the helo.

10:23.934 --> 10:25.434
System is triangulating now.

10:25.534 --> 10:27.433
Waters are busy today. Can we get I.D.s?

10:27.458 --> 10:28.458
Fishermen.

10:29.561 --> 10:31.079
I've worked these waters.

10:32.616 --> 10:34.692
Hell of a lot of trouble for one damn ship.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.097
This plan of your sister's...

10:36.198 --> 10:38.058
Jesus, we can get out and... and swim

10:38.083 --> 10:40.028
faster than this, Christos.

10:41.179 --> 10:42.424
Christos?

10:43.950 --> 10:45.051
Christos!

10:50.911 --> 10:52.277
Ohh. Oh, God...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.210
Multiple masts! 2 o'clock!

11:05.310 --> 11:06.549
Shit hot, kid.

11:07.364 --> 11:08.595
Nathan James,

11:08.677 --> 11:09.897
we got a possible target.

11:09.996 --> 11:11.356
Moving in for visual confirmation.

11:11.436 --> 11:14.090
We copy, Sunshine. Standing by.

11:14.366 --> 11:16.826
Nolan, we're gonna pop
up. Call it as you see it.

11:17.121 --> 11:18.160
Roger that.

11:21.502 --> 11:23.798
Three warships, guns pointed outward.

11:24.222 --> 11:26.276
Starboard ship has a big wake.

11:26.582 --> 11:28.282
Port ship... no wake at all.

11:28.382 --> 11:30.482
Center ship, approximately 15 knots.

11:30.582 --> 11:31.848
Dropping down.

11:33.142 --> 11:35.720
Based on the wake of those
ships, they're doing this...

11:36.837 --> 11:39.577
patrolling their quadrants,
protecting the middle ship.

11:39.677 --> 11:40.977
Classic NATO formation

11:41.077 --> 11:42.453
when traveling with a high value asset.

11:42.477 --> 11:43.520
The seeds...

11:44.117 --> 11:46.577
- are on that middle ship.
- Checks out.

11:46.909 --> 11:48.309
We need to move forward as planned.

11:48.350 --> 11:49.886
Call back our helo, light up the radar,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.210
and draw the first ship out.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.002
I still think it's a setup.

11:53.851 --> 11:56.644
It's too perfect, exactly what we'd expect.

11:57.085 --> 11:59.665
So the fact that nothing's
suspicious, makes it suspicious?

11:59.765 --> 12:01.405
They made a lot of noise to draw us here.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.160
I'm going with my gut, Mike.

12:05.445 --> 12:07.381
We light up, it won't be
one ship coming after us,

12:07.405 --> 12:08.545
it'll be all three.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.285
You're suggesting they'll engage us

12:10.365 --> 12:11.945
with the seeds on one of those ship?

12:12.045 --> 12:14.165
I'm suggesting the seeds
aren't on any of those ships.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.463
How do we prove it?

12:23.168 --> 12:24.948
- Kennedy maneuver.
- Kennedy maneuver.

12:25.048 --> 12:28.352
As in John F? As in Chris
Kennedy, call sign Talent.

12:28.762 --> 12:30.342
Warfare Tactics Instructor.

12:30.443 --> 12:32.388
- I remember her.
- Heard she was still alive.

12:32.435 --> 12:33.924
- She survived? No way.
- Yeah, on a sub.

12:33.948 --> 12:35.568
- That's great.
- You guys wanna...

12:36.232 --> 12:37.544
tell me about her maneuver?

12:41.650 --> 12:42.830
Copy that, Mother.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.688
Razor, light up the radar.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.425
Lighting her up.

12:47.086 --> 12:49.069
Nose is hot.

12:49.566 --> 12:52.718
Hellfire 1 safety is up
and primed for launch.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.891
Hold on to your ponytail, Nolan.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.530
_

13:07.990 --> 13:10.052
_

13:10.099 --> 13:11.946
They found us. It's working.

13:13.268 --> 13:14.464
Helo's been spotted.

13:14.496 --> 13:16.296
Greek ships just activated tactical radar.

13:16.659 --> 13:18.199
Sunshine, ready a hellfire,

13:18.299 --> 13:20.259
aim 2 degrees off the port
bow of the center ship.

13:20.339 --> 13:22.799
Roger, Mother. We're going in fangs out.

13:24.957 --> 13:25.985
Firing.

13:29.781 --> 13:31.797
_

13:31.822 --> 13:33.406
_

13:33.430 --> 13:35.727
_

13:38.344 --> 13:40.173
_

13:42.438 --> 13:43.783
Break! Break! Break!

13:47.178 --> 13:48.907
What the hell is Varvis doing?

13:49.939 --> 13:51.399
_

13:51.499 --> 13:53.053
_

13:53.077 --> 13:54.458
_

14:00.273 --> 14:01.293
Sunshine's clear.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.939
The high value ship should've fallen back,

14:03.964 --> 14:05.491
let the other ships protect it.

14:05.539 --> 14:07.419
Instead, it broke formation
to engage the helo.

14:07.499 --> 14:09.679
Which means that ain't no high value ship.

14:10.273 --> 14:11.727
My compliments to Commander Kennedy.

14:11.752 --> 14:13.172
But where are the seeds?

14:13.272 --> 14:14.528
Is it possible they
could already be in Malta?

14:14.552 --> 14:17.132
No way he got there so
fast. Vellek's still at sea.

14:17.808 --> 14:19.427
So there's a fourth ship.

14:21.225 --> 14:23.738
Smart move would be to
keep the other three ships

14:23.763 --> 14:25.303
between it and the Nathan James.

14:25.337 --> 14:27.117
If they assumed we'd close from the east,

14:27.217 --> 14:30.832
we'll find Vellek's ship somewhere... here.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.014
Out of sight, but still in
missile range of those ships.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.745
_

14:43.696 --> 14:45.636
Chandler saw through your trick, Stavros.

14:45.736 --> 14:48.476
He's probably looking for
my father's ship as we speak.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.596
Find the Nathan James and destroy her.

14:55.055 --> 14:58.039
_

15:04.872 --> 15:06.692
Green, I need you in command on the bridge.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.632
- Get us close to that fourth ship.
- Aye, sir.

15:08.672 --> 15:10.814
Pretty soon, we're gonna
have three ships on our asses.

15:10.838 --> 15:11.979
Start pitching.

15:12.758 --> 15:14.878
They gotta figure we're
headed west for the seed ship,

15:15.416 --> 15:17.736
and they know we won't find
it without firing up our radar,

15:17.856 --> 15:19.320
at least in short bursts.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.658
So... maybe that's
exactly what we should do.

15:23.670 --> 15:24.930
What do you have in mind?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.515
The Meylan maneuver.

15:50.268 --> 15:52.608
Green, Taylor, Kandie,
your objective is to pull

15:52.708 --> 15:56.248
all three warships out of
weapons range of the fourth.

15:56.896 --> 15:59.196
That means here, anything
more than 30 miles away

15:59.296 --> 16:01.336
from where we believe the
target ship to be located.

16:01.693 --> 16:02.918
Assets in the area?

16:02.943 --> 16:05.020
Fishing boats. Some in
use, others abandoned.

16:05.096 --> 16:06.576
Any vessel over 60 feet is gonna have

16:06.616 --> 16:09.004
the same radar signature as Nathan James.

16:09.289 --> 16:11.403
Find one, make the Greeks believe it's us.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.870
Draw them towards you, but
then get the hell out of there.

16:14.294 --> 16:15.814
You can reach us by encrypted radio,

16:15.894 --> 16:17.710
but we won't be able to
respond without compromising

16:17.734 --> 16:20.034
our position, so you're on your own.

16:20.470 --> 16:21.790
Miller, Burk, while Green is

16:21.870 --> 16:23.470
keeping the three screening ships busy,

16:23.550 --> 16:25.086
Nathan James is gonna find that flag ship.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.326
And when they do, we need to
be ready to board that vessel.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.610
- Yes, ma'am.
- Roger that.

16:34.231 --> 16:35.469
We're the good guys.

16:37.661 --> 16:39.232
We're the good guys.

16:40.408 --> 16:41.428
Here we go.

16:59.365 --> 17:02.869
_

17:04.670 --> 17:05.964
Commercial radar.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.078
18 seconds.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.338
Shutting it down.

17:22.753 --> 17:25.367
Hmm. We just lost the signal.

17:25.634 --> 17:28.656
So what? Half the boats out
there have commercial radar.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.906
Even I know that.

17:29.931 --> 17:31.351
Fishermen either have it on or off.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.738
They don't just switch
it on for a few seconds.

17:34.414 --> 17:37.015
- So it's Nathan James?
- It's the right size.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.492
They're looking for your father's ship.

17:38.493 --> 17:40.089
We should move to intercept.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.453
_

17:45.477 --> 17:48.656
_

17:53.988 --> 17:55.917
All three contacts altering course.

17:56.588 --> 17:57.768
They took the bait.

17:58.065 --> 18:00.025
Sunshine, this is Mother
requesting a sitrep.

18:00.105 --> 18:02.322
- Any sign of Vellek's ship?
- Roger, Mother.

18:02.452 --> 18:05.687
Search grid zone Alpha
one, negative contact.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.057
Copy.

18:07.705 --> 18:10.145
Alpha one, zero contact.

18:10.505 --> 18:11.861
Keep us updated.

18:12.881 --> 18:15.685
Helo's searching a new grid.
Set new course 2-9-0.

18:16.379 --> 18:18.527
Aye, ma'am. Coming to course 2-9-0.

18:24.993 --> 18:26.933
Permission to enter the pilot house, ma'am?

18:27.033 --> 18:28.938
- Master Chief...
- Ma'am...

18:31.637 --> 18:33.434
This ship is my home.

18:34.266 --> 18:36.358
And if this is gonna be
the battle of all battles,

18:36.359 --> 18:37.942
I sure as hell don't
wanna be hearing about it

18:37.966 --> 18:39.381
ankle-deep in salt water.

18:39.413 --> 18:41.273
Let me do my part.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.015
What I was going to say was,

18:45.054 --> 18:46.511
you're always welcome on my bridge.

18:53.494 --> 18:55.674
It's been half an hour. Why
haven't we seen them yet?

18:56.067 --> 18:57.767
We will have eyes on them soon.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.707
We're getting pulled away
from my father's ship.

18:59.731 --> 19:01.627
Soon we'll be out of range to defend him.

19:02.147 --> 19:03.398
Damn it.

19:03.531 --> 19:05.991
- What?
- That's just what Chandler wants.

19:08.178 --> 19:09.601
Maybe you're right.

19:10.018 --> 19:13.607
_

19:15.427 --> 19:16.518
Sir?

19:19.234 --> 19:21.059
All three contacts are converging.

19:22.249 --> 19:25.180
Those ships must be within a
couple hundred yards of each other.

19:25.244 --> 19:26.664
- Keep an eye on 'em.
- Aye, sir.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.324
Come on, come on, come on.

20:06.145 --> 20:08.487
Maroudiss, how much longer?

20:08.512 --> 20:11.532
Dr. Vellek, sir, an
hour or two, at the most.

20:11.557 --> 20:13.237
I don't have an hour or two, Maroudiss.

20:13.282 --> 20:15.722
I have the greatest creation
of humankind aboard this ship.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.391
It's the elixir of life, Maroudiss.

20:17.432 --> 20:19.688
You got me sitting around like
I'm poolside on a cruise ship.

20:19.712 --> 20:20.935
Apologies, sir.

20:21.098 --> 20:24.078
But any faster, and we'll
be jeopardizing your safety.

20:41.124 --> 20:43.711
I'm worried about Dad, alone on that ship.

20:44.724 --> 20:45.887
He's not alone.

20:46.874 --> 20:48.501
I'm worried about that, too.

20:49.886 --> 20:51.198
Try not to.

20:52.696 --> 20:53.978
He'll be better soon.

20:55.895 --> 20:56.926
We all will.

20:57.434 --> 20:59.021
What is that supposed to mean?

20:59.635 --> 21:00.635
Nothing.

21:01.695 --> 21:02.715
Hey.

21:23.564 --> 21:24.931
Enemy warship.

21:25.204 --> 21:26.860
Bearing 306.

21:28.889 --> 21:30.546
Where the hell are the other two?

21:30.964 --> 21:32.135
She's alone.

21:33.220 --> 21:35.000
Nathan James, Vulture team. Be advised...

21:35.178 --> 21:37.318
solo enemy warship heading east.

21:37.418 --> 21:38.918
No other contacts in the area.

21:39.018 --> 21:41.024
The other two ships dropped to
EMCON when the emitters merged.

21:41.048 --> 21:43.268
Which allowed them to peel off undetected.

21:43.829 --> 21:46.489
They're hunting us again. Only
this time, we won't see 'em coming.

21:46.589 --> 21:47.676
Bridge, Captain.

21:47.761 --> 21:50.508
Get watch standers to all radar
stations, lookouts to the rails.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.404
Won't be long till that ship figures it out

21:52.428 --> 21:53.848
and turns back to the others.

21:53.948 --> 21:56.108
We gotta give the Nathan
James a fighting chance.

21:56.547 --> 21:58.608
I won't make this decision for all of us.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.140
I came to fight.

22:02.928 --> 22:03.928
Kandie?

22:08.538 --> 22:10.078
Nathan James, Vulture team.

22:10.178 --> 22:12.274
We're gonna hang out for a bit,
make your life a little easier.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.258
Give you one less warship to worry about.

22:21.305 --> 22:22.646
They'll get it done.

22:26.874 --> 22:29.626
We got enough explosives
in here to sink that S.O.B.

22:30.114 --> 22:31.604
And we get one chance.

22:32.354 --> 22:34.500
One ship against the three of us?

22:36.078 --> 22:37.414
They're outnumbered.

23:02.825 --> 23:05.005
They're almost in range. Are we done yet?

23:08.974 --> 23:10.277
Just about.

23:14.377 --> 23:17.127
To remind us what we are working for.

23:18.703 --> 23:19.914
Now we're done.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.119
_

23:28.143 --> 23:29.965
_

23:34.455 --> 23:35.680
You were right.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.896
Nathan James isn't there.
The radar was a trick.

23:39.822 --> 23:40.974
I knew it.

23:44.355 --> 23:46.730
Enemy warship now at 1,600 meters.

23:46.915 --> 23:48.143
Let's go fishing.

23:49.756 --> 23:52.296
- Go on three.
- One, two, three!

24:35.374 --> 24:37.999
_

24:39.009 --> 24:41.365
_

24:49.049 --> 24:50.185
Now!

25:05.322 --> 25:07.448
I'm picking up explosions
in the water, sir.

25:09.392 --> 25:10.572
Metal shearing.

25:10.672 --> 25:12.026
And I have secondaries.

25:12.707 --> 25:13.858
One down.

25:16.467 --> 25:18.195
Vulture team just took out Alpha.

25:21.026 --> 25:22.112
That's my boy.

25:29.205 --> 25:30.383
Wolf!

25:35.565 --> 25:37.320
Green! Taylor's down!

25:37.845 --> 25:39.047
He has a pulse.

25:40.045 --> 25:41.112
Hang on.

25:41.650 --> 25:44.214
Wolf. Wolf. Answer me. Wolf.

25:50.894 --> 25:52.855
And here I thought you didn't care.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.783
We've lost them. Demeter is gone.

26:13.082 --> 26:15.782
- Giorgio.
- Nostos. Here? Now?

26:15.882 --> 26:17.702
Give it back. Give it back! I need it!

26:17.802 --> 26:20.542
- You need it. Dad needs it.
- It helps us, Giorgio.

26:20.642 --> 26:24.153
This stuff doesn't help
you. It destroys you.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.752
This a weapon for our enemies.

26:28.947 --> 26:31.582
No, it's a cure. It'll save us.

26:31.935 --> 26:33.855
From Malta, it will
spread from plant to plant,

26:33.935 --> 26:34.995
all around the planet,

26:35.095 --> 26:37.290
until everyone is growing it and eating it.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.780
No, that is not right.

26:39.879 --> 26:41.683
That is not what Dad said.

26:43.319 --> 26:47.141
We can't let ourselves turn
into those... those... creatures.

26:48.439 --> 26:49.742
It's the only way.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.259
Then we'll all finally be at peace.

26:53.959 --> 26:56.630
Sis, you can't do this. I won't let you.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.740
It's already done.

27:01.679 --> 27:04.188
I'm tired of being angry.

27:06.289 --> 27:07.299
Aren't you?

27:32.086 --> 27:34.282
Bulldog, bearing 3-1-5!

27:47.304 --> 27:48.424
Nathan James, Vulture Team.

27:48.504 --> 27:50.404
Be advised, small fishing vessel

27:50.503 --> 27:52.703
just destroyed by
surface-to-surface missile.

27:53.267 --> 27:54.767
No way anyone survived.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.803
I have the coordinates on
the Greek ship that fired.

27:56.827 --> 27:58.059
CIC, Bridge.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.305
There's a broadcast coming in over VHF.

28:00.667 --> 28:01.777
Put it through.

28:02.267 --> 28:03.629
You know where I am,

28:03.630 --> 28:05.230
but you're afraid to come out of hiding.

28:05.538 --> 28:07.778
I'm giving you a chance for a fair fight.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.158
Consider this a warning. Show your face,

28:10.258 --> 28:13.511
or I will continue killing
civilians at random.

28:15.018 --> 28:18.078
And nobody hates putting
innocent people in harm's way

28:18.768 --> 28:20.146
more than the U.S. Navy.

28:20.808 --> 28:22.972
Except for maybe Nobody himself.

28:25.487 --> 28:27.768
Five minutes, Captain Chandler.

28:30.419 --> 28:32.539
There's gotta be a dozen
more fishing boats out there.

28:56.745 --> 28:59.145
Sunshine still doesn't
have a visual on Vellek.

28:59.214 --> 29:00.674
But we have coordinates on Lucia.

29:00.775 --> 29:02.151
We should break EMCON, take her out.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.351
There's still a third ship out there.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.031
We light up, they see us, it blindsides us.

29:05.055 --> 29:06.995
What choice do we have?
We either fire on her

29:07.095 --> 29:08.755
or fire to protect the fishing boats.

29:08.855 --> 29:10.591
In three minutes, we're made either way.

29:11.678 --> 29:12.888
Maroudiss!

29:13.053 --> 29:15.313
Get on the good foot!
Come on, man, move it!

29:15.413 --> 29:16.869
- Doctor...
- I get it, man. I get it, man.

29:16.893 --> 29:18.493
You're between a rock and a hard place.

29:18.573 --> 29:20.433
But remember what's at stake, Maroudiss.

29:20.533 --> 29:22.309
Lucia said 12 knots. Any
faster will be jeopardizing...

29:22.333 --> 29:24.939
I don't give a damn
what Lucia says! Hear me?

29:25.333 --> 29:27.673
"Without a sign, his
sword the brave man draws

29:27.773 --> 29:29.873
and asks no omen but his cause."

29:29.973 --> 29:33.033
I bought your damn Navy.
Now speed it the hell up

29:33.133 --> 29:35.313
or else join the ranks
of those already martyred.

29:35.413 --> 29:38.585
Hear me? Let's go! Malta or bust!

29:38.640 --> 29:40.393
Malta or bust!

29:40.964 --> 29:43.744
OOD increase speed. All ahead full.

29:48.904 --> 29:50.383
Contact, 4 o'clock!

29:50.568 --> 29:52.183
Mother, this is Sunshine.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.236
We spotted smoke. It's Vellek's ship.

29:54.289 --> 29:56.210
Roger, Sunshine. Track
him, but keep your distance.

29:56.234 --> 29:57.974
We'll back you up as soon as we can.

29:58.459 --> 30:01.279
Lucia won't take us on unless
that third ship is close by.

30:01.831 --> 30:04.011
My guess... it's hiding
among those fishing boats.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.551
There's three vessels in range.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.748
- Chief, can you hulltech 'em?
- Checking.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.655
Negative, sir.

30:10.656 --> 30:12.296
We can't fire until we know who they are.

30:12.562 --> 30:14.562
We can if we use torpedoes.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.098
Set 'em to low-depth,
fire on all three vessels.

30:18.122 --> 30:19.302
If they're fishing boats,

30:19.402 --> 30:21.236
the torpedoes'll cruise right under 'em.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.623
If they're a warship, they go boom.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.810
ASW, ready three
torpedoes, 30-foot ceiling.

30:26.850 --> 30:28.509
Aye, sir. Torpedoes ready.

30:28.582 --> 30:29.730
Batteries release.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.670
_

30:49.180 --> 30:51.640
_

30:53.765 --> 30:54.865
_

31:00.002 --> 31:01.502
They've taken out Nereus.

31:01.805 --> 31:03.269
Where the hell are they, Stavros?

31:03.294 --> 31:07.202
_

31:07.226 --> 31:08.858
_

31:08.897 --> 31:10.819
You said when they fire, we'd see them.

31:10.881 --> 31:13.901
They didn't break EMCON.
But if we can pinpoint

31:14.001 --> 31:15.901
the torpedoes' origination point...

31:16.001 --> 31:19.537
_

31:19.603 --> 31:21.943
We got her. We got Nathan James.

31:22.430 --> 31:23.711
Then kill her.

31:24.003 --> 31:25.343
Vampire, vampire, vampire!

31:25.443 --> 31:27.203
Missile inbound! Target is Nathan James!

31:27.283 --> 31:29.559
Break EMCON. Set SPY to high power.

31:29.584 --> 31:31.464
Target acquired.
Calculating fire solution...

31:31.544 --> 31:33.764
- Kill it.
- Surface, aye. Engaging with birds.

31:39.886 --> 31:41.906
Nathan James has its hands full.

31:42.070 --> 31:43.856
And we're running low on fuel.

31:44.089 --> 31:46.094
We gotta slow this son of a bitch down.

31:46.296 --> 31:48.904
If the seeds are on that
ship, we can't lose her.

31:49.099 --> 31:50.659
Razor, arm the hellfire.

31:50.751 --> 31:52.907
Tally on target. Laser on.

31:53.602 --> 31:55.699
Knock out those screws, Sunshine.

31:57.050 --> 31:58.746
Hellfire has target locked.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.284
Firing in three, two...

32:09.992 --> 32:11.556
Warrant!

32:12.935 --> 32:14.455
Mother, this is Sunshine.

32:15.086 --> 32:17.506
We're hit. We're going down,

32:17.606 --> 32:19.936
grid zone... Charlie two.

32:20.032 --> 32:22.172
High value ship still in play.

32:22.197 --> 32:23.491
Sunshine, this is Mother.

32:23.554 --> 32:25.414
Please say again. Your last was garbled.

32:28.251 --> 32:29.654
Mother, do you read?

32:35.759 --> 32:37.934
You're hit. Oh, God.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.172
We gotta get you out of here.

32:42.173 --> 32:43.483
Nolan, listen...

32:44.173 --> 32:46.574
I bank left, you jump right.

32:47.093 --> 32:48.497
No, I can't.

32:49.293 --> 32:50.396
I won't.

32:51.073 --> 32:52.653
You gotta, Cupid.

32:54.733 --> 32:55.733
Yep.

32:56.373 --> 32:58.473
Congratulations. That's the one.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.804
You got yourself a call sign.

33:02.062 --> 33:03.330
Now go.

33:05.924 --> 33:07.118
Go.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.536
Target splashed. Helo's in the water.

33:21.537 --> 33:23.497
Nice shooting. Now let's
get the hell out of here.

33:28.335 --> 33:29.749
We just lost Hawklink.

33:29.976 --> 33:32.596
Bulldogs inbound, track 61, 62.

33:32.696 --> 33:34.712
Kill all inbound threats.
Ready Salvo two and re-engage.

33:34.736 --> 33:35.785
Aye, sir.

33:47.336 --> 33:48.676
_

33:48.776 --> 33:50.276
_

33:54.923 --> 33:57.640
_

33:57.664 --> 33:59.335
_

34:01.703 --> 34:03.780
Get them, Stavros. Kill those bastards.

34:03.805 --> 34:06.402
Look at you. You really
wanna give up this feeling?

34:09.812 --> 34:11.400
We're eight birds from empty, sir.

34:12.411 --> 34:14.313
We can't fight them to a draw.

34:15.391 --> 34:16.938
Then we have to fight smarter.

34:18.170 --> 34:19.951
Ready two Bulldogs, launch chaff,

34:20.043 --> 34:21.864
target Bravo from port and starboard.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.304
Yes, sir. Engaging.

34:29.364 --> 34:32.851
_

34:32.875 --> 34:35.239
_

34:35.637 --> 34:38.184
Drive it home, Chief,
right down the middle.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.270
Yes, sir.

34:43.806 --> 34:45.067
_

34:52.243 --> 34:54.922
Aah!

34:56.605 --> 34:57.753
Direct hit, sir.

34:57.933 --> 34:59.820
Lucia's ship is smokin' and sinkin'.

35:00.660 --> 35:01.800
Opa.

35:03.215 --> 35:04.566
And our helo?

35:35.440 --> 35:38.300
_

35:38.400 --> 35:39.900
_

35:46.160 --> 35:47.980
It's okay, it's okay.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.020
It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay.

35:53.003 --> 35:55.205
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.

35:56.769 --> 35:58.313
No, Giorgio!

35:58.338 --> 36:00.183
Look at me. Just hold on, okay?

36:00.537 --> 36:02.218
You need to hold on.
You need to look at me.

36:02.242 --> 36:03.962
Everything's gonna be
fine. I promise, okay?

36:03.988 --> 36:05.768
Just hold on. Just hold... just hold...

36:05.793 --> 36:08.120
- No. No.
- Lucia, tell Dad...

36:09.200 --> 36:10.980
that I-I tried.

36:11.260 --> 36:13.804
I know you did. You did.

36:15.075 --> 36:15.981
I...

36:16.016 --> 36:17.196
I fought.

36:17.296 --> 36:18.836
You did. You did.

36:30.136 --> 36:31.356
No.

36:31.456 --> 36:32.876
Somebody, help me!

36:32.976 --> 36:35.900
Somebody, help me, please!

36:36.341 --> 36:39.161
Giorgio, please. Don't... No.

36:39.285 --> 36:41.278
Lucia, we have to go!

36:42.180 --> 36:43.840
- No. No. No.
- We have to go.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.920
- No. No. No.
- Lucia, we have to go.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.320
- No.
- Come on, Lucia.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.756
No. No.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.974
Eagle in the water, 10 o'clock!

37:35.841 --> 37:37.338
Easy, easy.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.735
Pull on her leg. Come on.

37:40.543 --> 37:42.647
All right, now. 1, 2, 3.

37:42.672 --> 37:45.692
- Support her neck.
- Okay. Okay.

37:45.792 --> 37:47.172
Okay.

37:47.272 --> 37:48.725
You're gonna be fine, Nolan.

37:49.072 --> 37:50.496
You're gonna be fine. We got you.

37:52.381 --> 37:53.472
All right.

37:55.803 --> 37:56.932
Kath.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.520
This is Cobra, we got Nolan.

38:01.545 --> 38:02.923
Sunshine and Razor?

38:10.403 --> 38:12.125
Sunshine and Razor are KIA.

38:18.237 --> 38:20.539
There's no sign of Vellek's ship.

38:31.997 --> 38:33.804
We sank three ships today.

38:35.154 --> 38:37.228
The most important one's still out there.

38:38.557 --> 38:39.557
This...

38:40.669 --> 38:42.578
is our new Area of Uncertainty.

38:43.439 --> 38:44.895
Vellek could be anywhere in this zone.

38:44.919 --> 38:47.478
With the helo gone and
the fuel we have left,

38:48.161 --> 38:49.783
it's gonna be tough to narrow it down.

38:49.808 --> 38:52.853
We can't even be sure that Vellek
is still on his way to Malta.

38:56.027 --> 38:57.927
We've got our work cut out for us.

38:58.613 --> 39:00.657
We've done it before. We can do it again.

39:02.723 --> 39:03.986
Let's get started.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.396
This goddamned game.

39:17.345 --> 39:19.213
I can see now why you left.

39:45.262 --> 39:46.535
Giorgio's gone.

39:48.998 --> 39:50.744
Did you hear what I said, Dad?

39:51.774 --> 39:53.034
Giorgio's dead.

39:55.832 --> 39:57.137
The Nostos...

39:57.888 --> 39:59.678
I'm out of it. Do you have any?

40:05.128 --> 40:06.657
Your son has died.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.135
You need to feel that.

40:10.605 --> 40:11.788
Christos can't help you.

40:11.888 --> 40:13.708
He's been gone for years.

40:13.808 --> 40:16.495
And even dead, he cast a
shadow over Giorgio and me.

40:16.730 --> 40:19.790
And now Tom Chandler
has killed your only son.

40:20.108 --> 40:24.047
Giorgio died protecting
me! He died protecting you!

40:27.668 --> 40:31.114
All Giorgio ever wanted
to do was make you happy...

40:33.909 --> 40:36.089
and all you ever did was show him contempt.

40:39.592 --> 40:41.092
If you had just done what I said,

40:41.192 --> 40:42.819
that ship would never have found you.

40:43.270 --> 40:44.850
Giorgio died for nothing.

40:44.951 --> 40:46.005
No.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.731
No, not... not... not... not for nothing.

40:49.307 --> 40:52.087
Not for nothing, Lucia. For this. For this.

40:52.544 --> 40:55.646
Soon, it will not only be the
dead who know the end of war...

40:56.147 --> 40:57.407
but the living.

40:57.986 --> 40:59.966
Enough with the philosophizing.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.846
Giorgio was a hero. A hero.

41:05.426 --> 41:06.452
Was he?

41:07.608 --> 41:08.806
Of course he was.

41:22.958 --> 41:24.098
Here.

41:38.198 --> 41:40.378
Tell me,

41:41.567 --> 41:43.898
when you have your drink,
will Giorgio be with you?

41:47.967 --> 41:49.551
Or is he useless to you,

41:50.726 --> 41:52.528
even in your perfect world?
