Rel <i>is taped in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.744 --> 00:06.512
Could you do me a favor?
Could you look at Terry's bumps?

00:06.513 --> 00:07.853
Uh, you know his mom is worried

00:07.914 --> 00:09.749
that she may have to take him
to the hospital,

00:09.750 --> 00:11.550
but she don't know,
so what-what do you think?

00:11.551 --> 00:13.586
Uh, yeah, sure. Hey, Terry,
why don't you show me?

00:13.587 --> 00:17.890
I got one here, three right here,

00:17.891 --> 00:20.626
and I'm not sure
because I can't see them,

00:20.627 --> 00:23.029
but I have a lot on my butt.

00:23.030 --> 00:24.864
Uh, I'll save you some time.

00:24.865 --> 00:26.766
He wants to be Spider-Man

00:26.767 --> 00:30.469
and he's been putting spiders
in his bed so they can bite him.

00:30.470 --> 00:31.871
Terry, why would you do that, okay

00:31.872 --> 00:33.305
That wouldn't even work anyway.

00:33.306 --> 00:35.291
The spider's got to be radioactive.

00:35.292 --> 00:37.249
Good idea, Dad.

00:37.250 --> 00:39.084
I'll put them in the microwave.

00:39.085 --> 00:42.454
Yeah, y-you definitely
shouldn't do that.

00:42.455 --> 00:45.724
You don't know anything,
you evil doctor.

00:45.725 --> 00:48.326
Prepare to be webbed.

00:50.229 --> 00:52.964
All right, let's see who we got here.

00:52.965 --> 00:58.103
Uh... Tommy Smith. 5'11".
Allergic to penicillin.

00:58.104 --> 01:00.672
Oh. You're O negative.

01:00.673 --> 01:02.941
Well, what up, my O negative
blood brother? (CHUCKLES)

01:02.942 --> 01:04.775
What do you mean "blood brother"?

01:04.777 --> 01:06.511
I'm just saying
only seven percent of us

01:06.512 --> 01:08.380
have that blood type.
You know what I mean?

01:08.381 --> 01:11.183
So you got it, I got it,

01:11.184 --> 01:14.052
so you my O negative
blood brother. (CHUCKLES)

01:16.355 --> 01:18.590
All right, um...

01:18.591 --> 01:23.028
I see you fainted at the protest
yesterday due to a blood clot.

01:23.029 --> 01:25.697
Man, that's crazy,
them protest was wild yesterday

01:25.698 --> 01:28.800
from what I heard, and they said
a bunch of the alt-right dudes

01:28.801 --> 01:31.803
showed up with the khakis
and the tiki torches.

01:31.804 --> 01:34.005
It's good for you
standing up for your beliefs.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.941
Yeah, I was protesting inequality.

01:35.942 --> 01:37.042
That's great.

01:38.611 --> 01:42.147
And how this country has turned
its back on true nationalists

01:42.148 --> 01:44.783
in favor of a politically
correct global conspiracy.

01:49.689 --> 01:52.524
So you are actually
one of those tiki torch,

01:52.525 --> 01:55.694
khaki-wearing alt-right guys.

01:55.695 --> 01:58.163
How alt-right are you?

01:58.164 --> 02:00.832
This country was founded by
and for the white man

02:00.833 --> 02:04.903
and we need to take it back. ac

but that dude was talking
so crazy, man,

02:21.087 --> 02:22.988
if I ain't leave, I probably
would've stole on him.

02:22.989 --> 02:24.256

Man, who cares what

02:30.630 --> 02:32.931

02:36.302 --> 02:38.537
Nah, l-l-look, we just playing, bro.

02:38.538 --> 02:42.007
Look, you cannot aggressively
defibrillize the dude, okay?

02:42.008 --> 02:44.676
Like Michelle Obama always says,
"When they go low, we go high."

02:44.677 --> 02:47.846
Oh, no, no, no. We changed that.

02:47.847 --> 02:51.016
"When they go low, we kick 'em."

02:51.017 --> 02:53.652
Look, guys, it's not like
I've never dealt

02:53.653 --> 02:55.687
with a racist before,
but this dude, he was just

02:55.688 --> 02:57.489
real casual about it.
You know what I mean?

02:57.490 --> 02:59.424
Like, he was, he was really one
of the most confident racists

02:59.425 --> 03:00.759
I've ever talked to.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.761
I'm glad racists out in the open.

03:02.762 --> 03:04.529
I mean, for a while,
they was undercover.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.865
You had to trick them, sniff
them out with questions like,

03:06.866 --> 03:08.606
"Hey, man, you like
a mobile quarterback?"

03:10.036 --> 03:12.504
If they said no, racist.

03:12.505 --> 03:15.340
Yeah, like, when everybody says
a pure pocket passer,

03:15.341 --> 03:17.576
it always sound
like white power to me.

03:17.577 --> 03:19.477
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Like, look, man,

03:19.478 --> 03:21.713
a racist is always gonna be a racist.

03:21.714 --> 03:24.516
Our job is to make their life
as hard as we can, okay?

03:24.517 --> 03:26.017
So, what you gonna do, Rel?

03:26.018 --> 03:27.986
You gonna put some laxative
in his drink?

03:27.987 --> 03:29.588
Tell him you got the Ebola virus?

03:29.589 --> 03:31.056
It's from Africa,
that'll freak him out.

03:31.057 --> 03:32.657
Or better yet,

03:32.658 --> 03:36.328
paper his room with
all the Kwanzaa decorations.

03:36.329 --> 03:38.730
Dad, I can't do any of that, okay?

03:38.731 --> 03:40.599
And that's not gonna work. I'm...

03:40.600 --> 03:43.234
Look, me just messing with him
or-or just walking out on him,

03:43.235 --> 03:44.803
that's jeopardizing my job.

03:44.804 --> 03:47.205
And that's letting him win
if I do that.

03:47.206 --> 03:49.207
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm
gonna go back down there, right?

03:49.208 --> 03:50.575
And I'm-a do my job so well

03:50.576 --> 03:52.744
he's gonna have no choice
but to respect me.

03:52.745 --> 03:56.014
All right, you do you.
Leave a thermometer in his ass.

04:00.820 --> 04:03.521
Damn, Jake, you deejaying
in the middle of the afternoon?

04:03.522 --> 04:05.423
Yeah, yeah, when a song
this hot drops,

04:05.424 --> 04:07.325
you want to play it all day,

04:07.326 --> 04:09.227
and because it was requested
for a third time,

04:09.228 --> 04:11.029
and it's already my favorite song,

04:11.030 --> 04:14.966

It's not my fault you dated
Doolock then dumped him.

04:26.712 --> 04:30.482
If I was you, he'd still be my man.

04:30.483 --> 04:32.150
Listen, he was a terrible boyfriend.

04:32.151 --> 04:34.319
He didn't have a job,
he lived with his sister,

04:34.320 --> 04:37.322
and he would clip his toenails in bed.

04:37.323 --> 04:40.892
And one day I woke up
and one of them was on my face.

04:40.893 --> 04:42.594
I get it, you're filled with regret.

04:42.595 --> 04:44.095
If I had dumped Doolock,

04:44.096 --> 04:47.966
I'd be dead in a ditch someplace
by my own hand.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.869
But I didn't because I know
what a treasure looks like.

04:50.870 --> 04:53.772
So you know what I'm-a do?
I'm-a keep playing this song.

05:05.985 --> 05:07.452
Now, look, I've decided,

05:07.453 --> 05:08.987
even though you suck as a person,

05:08.988 --> 05:10.789
I'm not gonna suck at my job.
Now, sit up.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.657
I'm waiting for a real nurse.

05:12.658 --> 05:14.726
I am your real nurse.

05:17.263 --> 05:20.098
Now take a deep breath.

you hold your breath, pass out,

05:30.943 --> 05:32.310
I'm-a get paid regardless.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.381
You know, the crazy thing
about you being white,

05:36.382 --> 05:38.416
I can literally see you
losing consciousness.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.722
I mean, you're turning colors
already. Look. Oh, red.

05:43.723 --> 05:46.725
(CHUCKLES) Now you're blue.

05:46.726 --> 05:49.461
You red, white, and blue. (LAUGHS)

05:49.462 --> 05:52.230
You a whole flag now.

05:52.231 --> 05:54.065
Come on, man, there's no point
in you being angry

05:54.066 --> 05:55.500
and holding your breath.

05:55.501 --> 05:59.404
It's hard to be racist
when you're dead.

05:59.405 --> 06:02.440
(FORCEFULLY EXHALES, PANTING)

06:02.441 --> 06:05.276
Thank you.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.445
How did you get this job, anyway?

06:07.446 --> 06:11.316
Affirmative action?

06:11.317 --> 06:14.452
Well, matter of fact, bruh, I
got a perfect score on my NCLEX,

06:14.453 --> 06:16.454
and guess what I school went to?

06:16.455 --> 06:17.956
Malcolm X College.

06:20.459 --> 06:25.363
So, that's what's gonna happen?
What's next?

06:25.364 --> 06:28.266
Gonna make me apologize for
slavery for the thousandth time?

06:28.267 --> 06:31.436
Nah, you don't actually
have to apologize.

06:31.437 --> 06:33.171
I mean, from looking at you,

06:33.172 --> 06:35.312
your ancestors probably
couldn't even afford slaves.

06:38.277 --> 06:39.677
But look...

06:39.678 --> 06:42.914
What is that? What is that sign?

06:42.915 --> 06:45.850
Is that the racist Bat-Signal?

06:45.851 --> 06:49.254
Well, you guys have
gang signals, why can't we?

06:49.255 --> 06:50.922
You know, y'all be killing me

06:50.923 --> 06:52.791
thinking all black people
in gangs. I'm a nurse.

06:52.792 --> 06:55.460
I can't gangbang a nurse.
That don't make sense.

06:55.461 --> 06:56.895
Now, let me tell you this,

06:56.896 --> 06:58.530
you guys are the craziest
gang out here,

06:58.531 --> 07:00.231
and you don't even have
good gang colors.

07:00.232 --> 07:02.000
What gang wear khakis?
But you know something?

07:02.001 --> 07:03.935
I'm not, I'm not gonna do all that.

07:03.936 --> 07:06.404
I came here to do my job,
and that's what I'm-a do.

07:06.405 --> 07:10.108
- That's right.
- The hell is that?

07:10.109 --> 07:11.876
It's a catheter.

07:11.877 --> 07:14.045
Uh, you know, you gonna be under
the anesthesia for a while,

07:14.046 --> 07:16.214
so, you know, I got to put this
in your urethra.

07:17.883 --> 07:20.718
Oh, you don't know what that is

07:20.719 --> 07:25.690
with your very smart
white supremacist mind.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.725
Well, it's basically your pee hole.

07:27.726 --> 07:31.362
I want a qualified nurse to do this.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.599
So by qualified do you mean white?

07:34.600 --> 07:36.100
Oh, okay. Well...

07:36.101 --> 07:37.402
See, you ain't never been here before.

07:37.403 --> 07:38.770
You know, we only got, like,

07:38.771 --> 07:40.271
one white nurse that's on this floor,

07:40.272 --> 07:41.906
and, uh, she's not, uh,

07:41.907 --> 07:43.308
she's not really steady with her hands

07:43.309 --> 07:44.976
when it come to a catheter.

07:44.977 --> 07:46.917
That's right, we call her
"Butterfinger Becky."

07:48.781 --> 07:51.149
- Is she white?
- Yup.

07:51.150 --> 07:53.017
Then I would like her to do this.

07:53.018 --> 07:56.120
Man, your racist body,
your racist choice.

07:58.357 --> 07:59.824
- Becky.
- BECKY: Yes.

07:59.825 --> 08:00.992
Could you come help me real quick?

08:00.993 --> 08:02.227
Yeah, yeah, of course.

08:02.228 --> 08:04.562
As I predicted,

08:04.563 --> 08:07.465
this patient here would want you
to do the catheter insertion.

08:07.466 --> 08:09.634
- Damn.
- Yup.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.336
O-Okay. (CHUCKLES)

08:11.337 --> 08:12.904
You got this, go ahead.

08:12.905 --> 08:14.839
Oh, my God. Okay.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.175
- Okay, wow! (CHUCKLES)
- (CHUCKLES)

08:17.176 --> 08:20.411
Okay. Yay.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.982
- I'll be outside.
- Okay. Um...

08:23.983 --> 08:26.251
- So...
- TOMMY: No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:26.252 --> 08:28.119
No, no! Oh, whoa, oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:28.120 --> 08:31.189
Stop, stop, stop! Oh, oh, stop!

08:31.190 --> 08:35.159
Oh, whoa, hey, hey,
what's all the commotion, huh?

08:35.159 --> 08:36.995
Is everything okay in here?

08:36.996 --> 08:41.666
Well, I-I may have tried to go
a little too fast, or too slow.

08:41.667 --> 08:45.370
I'm not sure. Either way,
it-it didn't make it in.

08:45.371 --> 08:47.038
You know something, I'm...

08:47.039 --> 08:48.640
I would help you, but you know...

08:48.641 --> 08:50.341
(SCOFFS) You said you wanted

08:50.342 --> 08:52.377
a very qualified white nurse;
well, you got her.

08:52.378 --> 08:54.145
- (CHUCKLES)
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:54.146 --> 08:57.749
Just... Nurse Rel, will you,
will you do it?

08:57.750 --> 09:01.619
I'd do it, Tommy, if you say please.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.187
Please?

09:03.188 --> 09:04.856
- Okay.
- (CHUCKLES)

09:06.859 --> 09:09.794
(SIGHS) I got one more request,
though, brother.

09:09.795 --> 09:11.462
Could you put your fist up like this

09:11.463 --> 09:13.598
and say, "Black Lives Matter"?

09:19.355 --> 09:22.036
We'll put a tiny camera
down your esophagus

09:22.037 --> 09:24.849
and then we'll put a coiled hose
through your neck artery

09:24.850 --> 09:27.052
and thread the other end
through a vein at the groin

09:27.053 --> 09:29.254
and suction out the blood clot.
Any questions?

09:29.255 --> 09:31.456
U-Um, no.

09:31.457 --> 09:34.025
Okay, great. See you in the OR.

09:34.026 --> 09:37.362
All right, is there any problems
with the catheter?

09:37.363 --> 09:39.397
No, I'm-I'm... I'm okay.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.303
Okay. Look, even though
your a racist...

09:46.806 --> 09:48.506
I can see that you're scared, right?

09:48.507 --> 09:50.341
And it's my job to comfort you,
you know that?

09:50.342 --> 09:53.645
Look, have you ever...
had surgery before?

09:53.646 --> 09:56.014
No, I-I haven't even been in
a hospital since middle school

09:56.015 --> 09:58.083
when I burned myself
sitting in front of a lamp

09:58.084 --> 09:59.517
'cause I thought it had gamma rays

09:59.518 --> 10:01.186
and it would turn me into the Hulk.

10:01.187 --> 10:03.455
You know what's crazy?

10:03.456 --> 10:05.190
My son kind of did the same thing.

10:05.191 --> 10:07.592
He got a bunch of spiders
and put them in his bed

10:07.593 --> 10:08.993
so they could bite him,

10:08.994 --> 10:10.962
thinking it would turn him
into Spider-Man.

10:10.963 --> 10:12.764
That doesn't work.

10:12.765 --> 10:14.799
Wait, you did the same thing, too?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.435
Yeah, I mean, who doesn't
want to be Spider-Man?

10:17.436 --> 10:19.737
(CHUCKLES, SIGHS)

10:19.738 --> 10:21.739
Look, man, you don't have
nothing to worry about, okay?

10:21.740 --> 10:23.174
Surgery is gonna be okay.

10:23.175 --> 10:25.176
- All right?
- Okay.

10:25.177 --> 10:28.079
Spider-Man. (CHUCKLES)

10:29.815 --> 10:32.250
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

10:32.251 --> 10:34.085
All right, y'all, I want to
thank you y'all for coming out

10:34.086 --> 10:35.520
to the first ice cream happy hour

10:35.521 --> 10:37.255
in honor of "Sprinkle Dinkle."

10:37.256 --> 10:40.158
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

10:40.159 --> 10:42.427
Man, Brit, you lost out.

10:42.428 --> 10:44.562
Doolock's the new king
of the West Side.

10:44.563 --> 10:45.830
First of all, you can't have a city

10:45.831 --> 10:47.928
- run by some rapper named Doolock.
- Right.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.000
You got a city with all
the men running around

10:49.001 --> 10:51.202
with grills in their mouth
and chains around their neck,

10:51.203 --> 10:52.937
and you got the female
police officers twerking

10:52.938 --> 10:54.472
when they're trying
to write you a ticket.

10:54.473 --> 10:57.275
Man, that sounds amazing to me.

10:57.276 --> 10:59.410
Look, this whole generation is lost.

10:59.411 --> 11:01.479
At least you got some sense, Milt.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.315
There you go, playboy.
Sprinkle Dinkle.

11:06.685 --> 11:08.586
What the hell is everybody doing?

11:08.587 --> 11:11.222
They getting ready for the
Sprinkle Dinkle dance challenge.

11:11.223 --> 11:13.491
My man Doolock asked people
to submit videos

11:13.492 --> 11:15.593
of them sprinkling and dinkling.

11:17.363 --> 11:19.664
I'm sick of this.
Who made this dance up?

11:19.665 --> 11:21.666
It look like everybody ran out
of paper towels,

11:21.667 --> 11:23.201
so they air-drying their hands.

11:23.202 --> 11:25.069

- Still designing clothes?
- Yep.

12:44.984 --> 12:47.452
Doolock got his own clothing line.

12:47.453 --> 12:48.953
And what you don't realize is, boo,

12:48.954 --> 12:50.722
this could have been both of us. Huh?

We could have been a power
couple. All this could be yours.

Im-a backstroke by my damn self.

13:03.736 --> 13:07.272

is single and ready to sprinkle.

14:45.571 --> 14:47.405
Well, that's completely normal.

14:47.406 --> 14:49.073
So the surgery was a success,

14:49.074 --> 14:51.309
but there was a complication
removing the clot

14:51.310 --> 14:52.677
and you lost a lot of blood.

14:52.678 --> 14:54.112
Well, not to worry.

need to thank Rel.

the O negative blood supply,

Wow.

15:15.367 --> 15:16.768
We done come a long way, huh?

literally saved your life.

I don't want your disgusting
blood in me!

I'm gonna sue this hospital.

15:28.747 --> 15:30.081

15:30.082 --> 15:34.418
J-Just drain me! Drain me!

15:37.595 --> 15:40.242
Wait, wait, wait. You
gave this guy your blood?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.943
(CHUCKLES) Oh, that's genius, Rel.

15:41.944 --> 15:44.779
You put your black blood in a racist?

15:44.780 --> 15:47.389
Oh, man, I'm proud of you, son.

15:48.684 --> 15:52.120
Aw, man, I bet you his elbows
are ashy right now, man.

15:52.121 --> 15:55.323
I am so proud of you, man.

15:55.324 --> 15:58.493
Your ancestors are cheering you on.

15:58.494 --> 16:00.128
Okay, okay, Dad, look, look.

16:00.129 --> 16:01.763
I didn't do it
for my ancestors, all right?

16:01.764 --> 16:03.431
I was just doing my job.

16:03.432 --> 16:05.700
But man, you know,
instead of him thanking me

16:05.701 --> 16:07.836
for saving his life,
he treated me like trash.

16:07.837 --> 16:09.905
Oh, oh, I see.
I already told you once,

16:09.906 --> 16:11.740
you can't change a racist, man.

16:11.741 --> 16:13.241
What we need to figure out
is how to put some more

16:13.242 --> 16:15.744
black organs in him.

16:15.745 --> 16:17.045
Hey, Rel, I mean,
I know I was telling you,

16:17.046 --> 16:18.580
"Hey, go high" and all that stuff,

16:18.581 --> 16:20.582
but you went way higher
than I expected, bro.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.486
I mean, you literally put
yourself in that man heart.

16:24.487 --> 16:27.656
(SCOFFS) Michelle Obama
would be proud, man.

16:27.657 --> 16:30.125
Man, see, it's not
about all that, man.

16:30.126 --> 16:32.594
Like, I-I hate the fact
that he got me hating him.

16:32.595 --> 16:35.664
You know? I mean, hate is so
contagious, man, I hate hate.

16:35.665 --> 16:39.134
There is nothing I love
more than hate.

16:39.135 --> 16:40.669
Here you go, Rel.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.837
My hate made you this shirt.

16:42.838 --> 16:45.740
Here you go, Milt.
My hate made you this hat.

16:45.741 --> 16:49.077
And Nat, my hate made you
this quilted phone cover.

16:50.846 --> 16:53.848
Damn, Brit, this is
a dope-ass phone case.

16:53.849 --> 16:56.618
I know. See, at first, Doolock's
song annoyed me, right?

16:56.619 --> 16:59.854
But then, I decided to be mature
and channel my hatred.

16:59.855 --> 17:01.823
So I started designing and sewing,

17:01.824 --> 17:03.792
and it's the most productive
I've ever been.

17:03.793 --> 17:07.229
See, I realized Doolock
is the hate of my life.

17:07.230 --> 17:10.332
Feels so good to be in hate.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.067
(CHUCKLES) See, Rel? That's what
you got to do with hate.

17:12.068 --> 17:14.102
You got to take it,
throw it right back at them.

17:14.103 --> 17:16.238
Right. I took my power back.

17:16.239 --> 17:20.175
Look here.
I don't want to hate nobody,

17:20.175 --> 17:22.944
but I do want to take my power back.

17:22.944 --> 17:25.714
(STAMMERS) Ah, you know,
I know exactly what I'm-a do.

17:25.715 --> 17:27.884
All right? I'm-a go down there
and I'm-a demand an apology.

17:27.885 --> 17:29.553
And if he doesn't give it to me,

17:29.554 --> 17:33.056
I'm-a ask for my black blood back.

17:33.057 --> 17:35.258
- Oh, hey, Rel...
- No, no, no, no.

17:35.259 --> 17:37.027
Saved your life, all right?

17:37.028 --> 17:39.229
- And I need you to say, right...
- I'm sorry.

17:39.230 --> 17:43.667
Okay, that was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

17:43.668 --> 17:46.102
I mean, for real, I-I actually
was planning to come down here

17:46.103 --> 17:48.839
and pretend like I was gonna
take your blood back.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.742
And then turn on BET
until you beg for mercy.

17:52.743 --> 17:56.379
Look, you know,
I overreacted yesterday.

17:56.380 --> 18:00.851
And you treated me great
while I treated you terribly,

18:00.852 --> 18:05.222
and you saved my life,
and, um, I am sorry.

18:05.223 --> 18:09.059
You, Rel, have opened my eyes.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.428
That's a good first step.

18:11.429 --> 18:13.497
I mean, we got to communicate.

18:13.498 --> 18:16.099
And I can honestly say that...

18:18.436 --> 18:21.538
...you're one of the good ones.

18:21.539 --> 18:24.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

18:28.546 --> 18:30.180
You said I'm one of the good ones?

18:30.181 --> 18:32.616
Yeah. Yeah. Like, you're not living

18:32.617 --> 18:35.619
off of government handouts, you're...

18:35.620 --> 18:38.555
you're educated, y-you're well-spoken.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.993
Excuse me?

18:42.994 --> 18:45.061
Do you know how racist you sound?

18:45.062 --> 18:47.063
I mean, even when you're not
even trying to sound racist,

18:47.064 --> 18:48.832
you sound racist.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.166
- How did you get like this?
- Now, look.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.102
You don't understand, okay?

18:52.103 --> 18:55.005
It's getting harder and harder
for a white man to succeed.

18:55.006 --> 18:57.407
Okay? I-I've been... I've been
unemployed for three years

18:57.408 --> 19:01.177
because the... these minority
caravans are taking our jobs.

19:01.178 --> 19:02.779
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Okay, bro. You-you...

19:02.780 --> 19:04.848
You talking about jobs? For real?

19:04.849 --> 19:08.084
First of all,
y'all always had the jobs.

19:08.085 --> 19:10.353
Okay? And second of all,

19:10.354 --> 19:12.889
dude, if you stop going to all
these meetings and rallies

19:12.890 --> 19:15.592
and just maybe go to a job fair or...

19:17.295 --> 19:19.329
...or take some classes
or send a résumé...

19:19.330 --> 19:21.498
Okay, you know,
o-of course you'd say that.

19:21.499 --> 19:25.835
You-you need get off
the Democratic plantation.

19:25.836 --> 19:29.105
(EXHALES) Okay, you know
something? I-I see what this is.

19:29.106 --> 19:33.109
Right? For the first time
in your life,

19:33.110 --> 19:35.145
you know, you're not just
getting something handed to you

19:35.146 --> 19:37.681
based on the color
of your skin, right?

19:37.682 --> 19:40.183
You got to earn it.
You got to be qualified.

19:40.184 --> 19:42.085
(REL LAUGHS SOFTLY)

19:42.086 --> 19:46.956
Just a whiny, uneducated,
entitled little punk.

19:49.126 --> 19:50.961
I'm not finna waste my breath
with you no more.

19:50.962 --> 19:52.929
I did my job,
you'll be discharged shortly.

19:55.232 --> 19:57.233
Oh, and I forgot.

19:57.234 --> 20:01.304
Uh, we're gonna make sure
we bill your Obamacare.

20:01.305 --> 20:06.176
I-I do not have Obamacare.

20:06.177 --> 20:10.280
I have health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act.

20:15.252 --> 20:17.921
Well, I hate to bust your bubble.

20:17.922 --> 20:19.723
That is Obamacare.

20:19.724 --> 20:21.625
That's right.

20:21.626 --> 20:24.628

and you didn't even know it.
