SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE

00:59.208 --> 01:01.250
RESPIRATORY RATE IS 8.

I'M CALLING THEM.

01:03.625 --> 01:06.375
SHE'S STILL ALIVE, BUT I CAN
BARELY PALPATE HER PULSE.

01:06.417 --> 01:09.041
PETE, WHERE IS THE BABY?

01:09.083 --> 01:12.000
I DON'T KNOW.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.375
THIS IS DR. NAOMI BENNETT.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.667
I-I NEED AN AMBULANCE
IMMEDIATELY

01:26.083 --> 01:29.041
I GOT AN O.R. STANDING BY.
MONTGOMERY'S ON HER WAY.
I'M HERE.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.458
SET UP A CENTRAL LINE. WE NEED
BLOOD. WHAT'S HER BLOOD TYPE?

01:31.500 --> 01:34.834
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
HER BLOOD TYPE?
C.B.C., CHEM-7,
CROSS AND TYPE TIMES 4.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.083
SET UP A RAPID INFUSER.
WHERE'S THE BABY?

01:37.125 --> 01:39.208
WE DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS A PLACENTA

01:39.250 --> 01:41.208
AND--AND THE CORD WAS CUT,
BUT THERE WASN'T...

01:41.250 --> 01:43.291
OKAY, I GOT THIS, PETE.
I SHOULD KNOW HER BLOOD TYPE.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.291
PETE, I'M TAKING OVER,
ALL RIGHT? STAY HERE.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.041
COOPER, A LITTLE HELP.
I-I WAS THERE. I WAS THERE
AND I HEARD A NOISE.

01:48.083 --> 01:51.041
I WAS RIGHT AT HER DOOR,
AND I LEFT.
(Addison) OKAY, NAI,
LET'S GO. COME ON.

A TRAUMA GOWN, PLEASE?
YOU GOTTA USE O-NEG.

PETE, JUST LET ME--
LET ME DO MY JOB.
SHE'S LOST SO MUCH BLOOD.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.458
OKAY, JUST WAIT HERE.
NO, NO, I GOTTA BE

01:58.500 --> 02:01.667
NO, DR. WILDER. LOOK AT ME.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.667
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO CONVINCE YOU

02:03.709 --> 02:06.458

02:06.500 --> 02:09.000
THERE IS NO TIME. WAIT HERE.
COOPER.
PETE.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.041
WE HAVE A KITCHEN!

02:15.083 --> 02:17.041

WE HAVE A-A KITCHEN.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.500
IT'S NICE.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.500
AT MY LAST OFFICE,
I HAD A, UM,

02:20.542 --> 02:22.500
I HAD A MINI FRIDGE
WEDGED UNDER MY DESK.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.500
THAT'S WHERE I KEPT
THE URINE SAMPLES.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.333
THIS IS FANCY.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.959
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT SAM AND NAOMI?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.333
THEY SEEM NICE.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.333
I MEAN,
I LIKE 'EM 'CAUSE THEY,

02:32.375 --> 02:34.375
YOU KNOW, HIRED ME.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.375
WHY? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:36.417 --> 02:38.375
(clicks tongue)
THEY'RE HAPPY.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.375
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE HAPPY PEOPLE.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.959
THEY'RE HAPPY PEOPLE
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.834
IT'S CREEPY.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.291
DO YOU THINK IT'S REAL,
THE LOVE?
(laughs)

02:47.333 --> 02:50.542
OH, IT'S REAL.
OH, MY GOD. OH, I'M JUST--
I WAS--I'M SORRY, SAM.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.709
I THINK WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY
WAS THANK YOU FOR OUR JOBS.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.709
IF HE'S TRYING TO GET YOU
TO WORK HERE, SAY YES.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.041
IT'S FANCY.
WE HAVE A KITCHEN.
NO, I'M JUST--

02:59.083 --> 03:01.417

HI. PETE WILDER.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.083
THIS IS PETE, THE FRIEND
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.667
OH, YES. PETE.
RIGHT.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.041
OH, YES. WHAT?
WHAT AM I MISSING?

03:12.083 --> 03:15.125
I'M A PATIENT. I'M...
SUPPOSED TO BE A PATIENT OF--

03:15.166 --> 03:18.125
OH.
SAM WANTS ME TO SPEAK
WITH VIOLET ABOUT MY WIFE.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.250
OH. DIVORCED?

03:20.291 --> 03:22.542
DEAD.
SHE DIED FOUR DAYS AGO.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.041
(Naomi) HEY.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.959
HEY.
I CAME UP WITH A NAME.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.125
OCEANSIDE WELLNESS.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.542
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

03:30.583 --> 03:32.458
YEAH.
WHAT?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.542
(siren wails)

03:35.583 --> 03:37.750
WHAT HAPPENED?
UM, SOMEONE...

03:37.792 --> 03:39.667
TOOK VIOLET'S BABY.

03:39.709 --> 03:42.166
THEY CUT HER
AND TOOK HER BABY.
KATIE. IT HAD TO BE KATIE.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.500
(Dell) VIOLET'S PATIENT?
I'M GOING IN THERE.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.208
NO, NO. COME ON.
I'M FAMILY.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.208
WE'RE ALL FAMILY HERE,
ALL RIGHT? ADDISON'S GOT THIS.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.000
SHE--SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO BE
WITH ME. SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.000
SHE SAID...
WE SHOULD GET YOU
CLEANED UP.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.208
WHAT?
BLOOD, MAN.
YOU'RE COVERED IN BLOOD.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.792
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
COME ON. RIGHT THIS WAY.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.166
(Betsey) DADDY?
YEAH.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.917
SOMEONE GOT HURT?

04:02.959 --> 04:05.000
UH, YEAH, YEAH.
SOMEONE GOT HURT.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.041
(Pete) SAM SAYS YOU'RE GREAT.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.208
WELL, HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW ME,
BUT, UH, BUT I AM. I'M GREAT.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.250
WELL, HE'S GREAT, TOO--SAM.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.250
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
WORKING FOR HIM.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.333
AND, WELL,
THESE OFFICES ARE NICE.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.041
THEY'RE BIG.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.041
I'M STALLING.

04:25.083 --> 04:29.041
THERAPY IS HARD
FOR SOME PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT HARD.
IT'S JUST ARTIFICIAL.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.500
SITTING DOWN AND TELLING
YOUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS

04:31.542 --> 04:35.041
TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW?
DID YOU TELL
ALL YOUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS

04:35.083 --> 04:36.834
TO SOMEONE YOU DO KNOW?

04:36.875 --> 04:38.834
DID YOU DO THAT
WITH YOUR WIFE?

04:38.875 --> 04:40.834
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE
TO TALK ABOUT, RIGHT?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.834
LOOK, I'M NOT HERE FOR ME.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.834
I'M HERE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER

04:44.875 --> 04:46.834
THAN HAVING SAM AND NAOMI
BE ALL OVER ME

04:46.875 --> 04:48.875
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET
THE FACT THAT I'M COPING.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.250
MY WIFE DIED, AND IT'S AWFUL,
AND I'M COPING.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.166
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT HER?
NO. I...

04:54.208 --> 04:55.792
HER NAME'S ANNA.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.166
IT WAS.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.083
SHE DIED OF AN ANEURYSM
IN HER SLEEP.

04:59.125 --> 05:02.959
SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PAIN.
THERE WAS NO SUFFERING.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
LOOK, I...

05:05.041 --> 05:06.458
I RESPECT WHAT YOU DO,

05:06.500 --> 05:08.458
AND I GET
THAT SAM AND NAOMI THINK

05:08.500 --> 05:11.041
THAT I'M NOT SHOWING
THE RIGHT EMOTION

05:11.083 --> 05:13.083
OR I'M IN DENIAL
OR I'M NOT TALKING ENOUGH,

05:13.125 --> 05:14.542
BUT I'M A PRIVATE PERSON.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.667
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT FEELING
THIS, THAT I DON'T MISS HER.

05:17.709 --> 05:19.667
UH, MAYBE I'M NOT
DISPLAYING MY EMOTIONS,

05:19.709 --> 05:21.792
BUT I'M FEELING THIS
IN MY OWN WAY.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.792
I UNDERSTAND THAT. I-I DO.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.333
BUT, UM, I STILL THINK,
AS A PROFESSIONAL,

05:26.375 --> 05:29.041
TALKING ABOUT THOSE FEELINGS
WILL HELP.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.500
I JUST... DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.041
I... THIS--

05:34.083 --> 05:36.625
WHAT HAPPENED IS HORRIBLE.

05:36.667 --> 05:40.041
BUT I'LL GET THROUGH IT
IN TIME...

05:40.083 --> 05:42.500
ON MY OWN.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.041
(man) YOU SAY SHE HAD
A MENTAL ILLNESS, THE ATTACKER?

05:46.083 --> 05:47.625
YES. KATIE. KATIE KENT.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.500
IS SOMEONE OUT
LOOKING FOR THE BABY?
WE PUT OUT AN--

05:50.542 --> 05:53.417
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO HOURS.
WE PUT OUT AN AMBER ALERT.
EVERYONE IS LOOKING.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.333
HAVE YOU CHECKED HER APARTMENT?
SHE'S CLEARED OUT.
EVERYONE IS LOOKING, SIR.

05:56.375 --> 05:59.208
YOU WERE AT THE CRIME SCENE?
YES, I TOLD THE OTHER OFFICER.
I FOUND HER.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.542
MAYBE IF YOU'D PUT
SOMETHING ON TV--
SIR, WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THE VICTIM?

06:02.583 --> 06:04.542
VIOLET! HER NAME IS VIOLET!
PETE--

06:04.583 --> 06:06.542
THE GUY IS STANDING HER
ASKING ME QUESTIONS,

06:06.583 --> 06:09.041
AND THE WOMAN IS OUT--
(Dell)
JUST LET HIM DO HIS JOB.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.333
SIR, YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO... VIOLET.
HE'S HER BOYFRIEND.

06:11.375 --> 06:14.583
I WAS SEEING A PATIENT UPSTAIRS
AND I-I HEARD.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.125
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE CALLED.
AND WHO ARE YOU?

06:17.166 --> 06:19.542
I'M THE BABY'S FATHER.

06:19.583 --> 06:22.041
UH, WELL, KIND--
KIND OF THE BABY'S FATHER.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.959
MAYBE THE FATHER. SO IS HE.
WE'RE BOTH--
WE'RE THE BABY'S FATHER.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.375
IT'S A LONG STORY.

06:26.417 --> 06:29.458
IT'S... JUST WEAR A CONDOM.
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.041
(chuckles)

06:34.083 --> 06:35.917
(chuckles)

06:38.041 --> 06:41.000
(sighs)

06:50.834 --> 06:52.625
THERE'S A WAITING ROOM...

06:52.667 --> 06:55.250
WITH CHAIRS.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.375
I HAD TO CALL
VIOLET'S PARENTS.

06:59.417 --> 07:04.041
THOSE PEOPLE ARE...
OKAY, YES, THEY ARE WORRIED.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.000
BUT THEY'RE ON VACATION
IN LONDON.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.500
THEY DIDN'T EVEN CONTEMPLATE
GETTING ON AN AIRPLANE TO L.A.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.500
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.041
SHE WAS RAISED BY WOLVES,
BY INTELLECTUAL, SNOOTY WOLVES.

07:13.083 --> 07:16.041
I'M BASICALLY--I MEAN,
I'M HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.417
(cell phone beeps)

07:18.458 --> 07:20.417
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHECK IT?

07:20.458 --> 07:23.417
NOBODY WANTS ME TREATING
THEIR KID IN THIS STATE.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.667
THE ANSWERING SERVICE
WILL REFER WHOEVER'S ON CALL.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.458
YOU KNOW, I WAS RIGHT THERE.
I WAS AT THE DOOR.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
AND YOU CALLED,
AND--AND I-I--
I CALLED BECAUSE I GOT FIRED.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.500
NO--
I CALLED BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY BOYFRIEND, AND I NEEDED YOU.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.875
NO, I'M NOT BLAMING YOU.
I'M NOT SAYING--

07:40.917 --> 07:43.875
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. IT'S
MY FAULT. I COULDA STOPPED IT.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.041
I COULDA WALKED--
I COULD'VE SAVED HER.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.041
IF SHE HAD
HAD THE BABY YESTERDAY

07:48.083 --> 07:50.250
LIKE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO...

07:50.291 --> 07:53.291
SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO.
YEAH, SHE'S A REAL BITCH
THAT WAY.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.917
JUST MAKING A POINT.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.458
WHICH IS?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.750
SHE'S NOT TO BLAME.
I'M NOT TO BLAME.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.792
YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.583
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO DESERVES BLAME

08:02.625 --> 08:05.041
IS THAT WOMAN WHO ATTACKED HER
AND TOOK HER BABY.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.250
YOU'RE NOT A SUPERHERO, COOP.

08:07.291 --> 08:10.542
NO, I'M HER FAMILY.

08:13.375 --> 08:16.417
JUST TAKE MY HAND
AND BREATHE.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.834
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.041
WE TREAT HER LIKE
A MULTIPLE STAB WOUND VICTIM--

08:27.083 --> 08:29.041
CONTROL THE BLEEDING,
REPAIR ANY ORGAN DAMAGE,

08:29.083 --> 08:31.083
AND WE GET OUT
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

08:31.125 --> 08:34.959
NAI, SCRUB IN. I NEED
ALL THE HANDS I CAN GET.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.041
NAI.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.041
I WAS GOING OVER TO HER HOUSE

08:38.083 --> 08:40.625
TO TELL HER
THAT I WAS LEAVING THE PRACTICE.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.458
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER

08:42.500 --> 08:44.542
EVERY SINGLE DAY
FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS--

08:44.583 --> 08:46.041
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.125
ARE YOU SURE?

08:48.166 --> 08:50.041
NO.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.417
(woman) I.V. TECH
TO ROOM 321.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.959
I.V. TECH TO ROOM 321.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.333
HEY, DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

09:03.375 --> 09:05.000
NO.
NO.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.041
(sighs)

09:11.083 --> 09:13.041
VIOLET WANTED
TO HAVE KATIE COMMITTED.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.083
SHE KNEW.
AND I MADE FUN OF HER.
WE MADE FUN OF HER.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.709
SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG,
AND I TALKED HER OUT OF IT.
WE TALKED HER OUT OF IT.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.417
I SHOULD'VE--
I SHOULD'VE JUST LET--

09:21.458 --> 09:23.417
WE. WE. WE.
IT IS WE, NOT YOU.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.834
WE ARE IN LOVE WITH VIOLET.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.041
WE ARE THE POSSIBLE FATHERS
OF THAT BABY.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.041
WE ARE WORRIED.
WE ARE SCARED.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.041
WE IGNORED HER CONCERNS
ABOUT KATIE.

09:32.083 --> 09:35.542
WE, NOT YOU, YOU SMUG,
ARROGANT BASTARD.
BUT I'M THE ONE SHE CHOSE.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.208
COME ON.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.542
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I'M OKAY.

09:45.458 --> 09:49.000
HOW DOES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.709
I DON'T KNOW.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.500
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.583
HOW'S SHE DOING?
(Addison)
PRESSURE'S 60 OVER 40.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.041
SHE'S LOSING BLOOD FASTER THAN
I CAN TRANSFUSE IT IN.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.375
OH, GOD. WHAT DID
SHE USE, A HATCHET?

10:29.417 --> 10:31.875
THERE. GOT IT.

10:31.917 --> 10:35.000
ADDISON, HER PRESSURE'S
NOT COMING UP.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.542
DAMN IT. SHE IS BLEEDING
FROM EVERYWHERE.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.792
NAI, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
EXTEND THE INCISION

10:39.834 --> 10:41.125
TO MAKE IT VERTICAL.

10:41.166 --> 10:44.041
WE GOTTA SEE WHAT ELSE
IS BLEEDING AND TIE IT OFF.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.667
SCALPEL.
(Dell) ADDISON.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.000
WHAT?
THEY NEED ANSWERS.
PETE, SHELDON--

10:48.041 --> 10:51.041
I-I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO TELL THEM SOMETHING.
(Naomi) ADDISON!

10:51.083 --> 10:54.667
IT'S NOT THE LIVER EDGE. IT'S
ONE OF THE MESENTERIC ARTERIES.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.917
ALL RIGHT. CLAMP.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.041
WE'RE ALL HERE, VIOLET,
PULLING FOR YOU.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.625
JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU, DELL.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.417
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.417
DELL, STOP TALKING!
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.834
ADDISON...
HE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.750
YOU JUST--YOU KEEP TALKING
TO HER, DELL. GO AHEAD.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.709
UM...

11:21.750 --> 11:23.709
I-I GOT BETSEY BACK,

11:23.750 --> 11:26.291
WHICH WAS MAYBE
THE HARDEST THING I'VE DONE.

11:26.333 --> 11:30.041
BEFORE BETSEY,
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A FAMILY.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.834
YOU GUYS...

11:32.875 --> 11:35.875
(voice breaks)
YOU'RE MY FAMILY.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.875
YOU'RE MY FAMILY, VIOLET.

11:37.917 --> 11:40.875
SO... I'M SITTING HERE
SELFISHLY TELLING YOU...

11:40.917 --> 11:42.792
NOT TO DIE.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.000
OKAY?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.125
(crackling)

11:50.166 --> 11:53.125
SO I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH LEO BRINKMAN.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.750
HE HAS TO PUSH BACK
HIS START DATE?

11:55.792 --> 11:57.458
NO, HE GOT SUED.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.542
YEAH, APPARENTLY HE LIKES
TO TOUCH HIS PATIENTS' FEET...
(Violet) OOH!

12:00.583 --> 12:02.417
FOR SEXUAL REASONS.
(Naomi) GREAT.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.792
OOH. SHOULDA GONE
INTO PODIATRY.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

12:04.834 --> 12:08.041
IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.
BUT IT'S AWFUL.
WE'RE STILL SHORT ONE.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.166
D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW
A GOOD DERMATOLOGIST?

12:10.208 --> 12:12.041
WELL,
I ACTUALLY WAS THINKING,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.041
MAYBE WE COULD GIVE
HIS SLOT TO PETE.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.208
I THOUGHT HE WAS
INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.583
IT'S EVEN BETTER.
HE'S GOT A GREAT PRACTICE.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.583
I LIKE IT.
IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE,

12:20.625 --> 12:23.041
AND HE DOES CRITICAL CARE--
THAT'S TWO FOR ONE.
(Sam) I KNOW.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.041
BUT WE CAN'T--I MEAN,
HE CAN'T WORK HERE

12:25.083 --> 12:28.041
'CAUSE HE'S A PATIENT,
SO WE CAN'T HIRE HIM.
(Sam) WAIT, WAIT.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.792
HE GOES TO YOU ONCE BECAUSE I
MAKE HIM, NOW HE'S OFF-LIMITS?

12:30.834 --> 12:34.041
ACTUALLY, YES. I HAD A SESSION
WITH HIM, SO HE'S A PATIENT.
EVEN IF HE SAYS HE'S FINE?

12:34.083 --> 12:36.375
HE SAYS HE'S FINE.
I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.500
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM,

12:38.542 --> 12:41.417
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
SENT HIM TO ME.
OBVIOUSLY HE'S NOT FINE.
HIS WIFE JUST DIED.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.834
IS HE A GOOD DOCTOR?
(Sam) HE'S A GREAT DOCTOR.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.041
LOOK, LET'S SAY COOP KEELS OVER
FROM A HEART ATTACK...
OOH.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.709
AND I GIVE HIM C.P.R.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.083
DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO FIRE
HIM BECAUSE HE'S "MY PATIENT"?

12:50.125 --> 12:52.875
UM, SAM, COULD YOU NOT PUT
THINGS LIKE THAT OUT THERE.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.041
THE UNIVERSE HAS
A PERVERSE SENSE OF HUMOR.
WE CANNOT HIRE HIM.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.041
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IS THIS AN ISSUE

12:57.083 --> 12:59.083
BECAUSE HE'S A PATIENT
OR THERE'S A PROBLEM?

12:59.125 --> 13:02.041
(Sam) WAIT, YOU KNOW PETE.
YEAH, I-I-I DO.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.250
BUT IF HE CAN'T SUIT UP,
WE CAN'T USE HIM.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.917
THAT'S THE ISSUE.
OKAY, WE NEED A NEW PARTNER--
A GOOD DOCTOR,

13:07.959 --> 13:09.917
AND SOMEONE THAT WE
GET ALONG WITH PERSONALLY.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.083
PETE IS BOTH.
LOOK, THERE IS
SOMETHING THERE, OKAY?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.083
I MEAN, HE SAT WITH ME,
HE SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS,

13:15.125 --> 13:18.041
HE KNEW ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.458
AND UNTIL I KNOW WHAT IT IS,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.458
UNTIL HE'S READY TO FACE
WHAT IT IS,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.291
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT HIM
WORKING HERE.

13:27.083 --> 13:30.250
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:30.291 --> 13:32.458
I HATE THIS.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.458
I HATE IT. I SHOULD--
I SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.458
I SHOULD BE OUT LOOKING
FOR KATIE OR THE BABY OR--

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.000
WHAT IF SHE DIES?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.917
I HAD A PATIENT...

13:55.959 --> 13:59.417
AN OLD WOMAN, A SOUTHERN WOMAN,
SOUTHERN BAPTIST.

13:59.458 --> 14:02.291
STRONGEST WOMAN I EVER MET.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.583
AND THEY WERE HAVING A PARTY
FOR HER 90th BIRTHDAY,

14:05.625 --> 14:07.583
ONLY SHE WAS HAVING
CHEST PAINS,

14:07.625 --> 14:09.583
SO THEY TOOK HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

14:09.625 --> 14:12.583
A MINIVAN T-BONED HER CAR
ON THE WAY THERE.

14:12.625 --> 14:17.333
SHE LOST HER HUSBAND,
TWO SONS, A GRANDCHILD.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.333
HER HEART WAS FINE.

14:19.375 --> 14:22.375
IT WAS, UH, INDIGESTION.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.542
IS THERE A POINT OR ARE YOU
JUST SPOUTING RANDOM CRAP?

14:31.583 --> 14:33.542
SHE CAME TO ME
BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS WORRIED

14:33.583 --> 14:36.750
THAT SHE WAS SO DEVASTATED,
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO ON.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.750
SO I-I ASKED HER.
I ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS COPING.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.750
AND SHE SAID TO ME,
"SON, GOD WILL PROVIDE."

14:43.792 --> 14:45.750
THAT'S IT?

14:45.792 --> 14:47.959
SHE LOSES EVERYTHING.
"GOD WILL PROVIDE"?

14:48.000 --> 14:51.041
MY POINT WAS...
WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.917
DO YOU?

14:52.959 --> 14:55.041
HAVE FAITH?

14:55.083 --> 14:56.917
NO.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.834
BUT I'M PRETENDING I DO.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.417
VASCULAR CLAMP.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.041
OKAY, BOVIE HERE.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.041
THE BLEEDING'S NOT SLOWING.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.041
I KNOW. EVERY TIME
I SEW UP ONE BLEEDER,

15:17.083 --> 15:19.041
ANOTHER ONE APPEARS.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.041
SHE'S LOST SO MUCH BLOOD.
I DON'T--

15:21.083 --> 15:24.041
I DON'T THINK SHE CAN TAKE
MUCH MORE.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.208
TAKE OUT HER UTERUS.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.041
A HYSTERECTOMY?

15:28.083 --> 15:30.041
TO SAVE HER LIFE.
NO.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.250
I CAN EMBOLIZE
THE UTERINE ARTERIES,

15:32.291 --> 15:35.041
BLOCK THE BLOOD SUPPLY
AND STOP THE BLEEDING.
SHE COULD DIE WHILE YOU'RE
PREPPING HER FOR THE PROCEDURE.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.709
DO THE HYSTERECTOMY.
WHAT IF THE BABY'S
GONE FOR GOOD, NAI?

15:37.750 --> 15:39.709
VIOLET WAKES UP,
HER BABY'S GONE,

15:39.750 --> 15:42.041
AND SHE CAN'T HAVE
ANOTHER CHILD?
WE'LL FIND THE BABY.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.041
OKAY, LIFE ISN'T ALWAYS
THAT SIMPLE AND EASY, NAI.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.333
BABIES DON'T ALWAYS GET FOUND.

15:47.375 --> 15:50.041
THERE ISN'T ALWAYS
A HAPPY ENDING.
YEAH, THINGS DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE A HAPPY ENDING,

15:50.083 --> 15:52.709
BUT SHE WOULD BE ALIVE,
ADDISON. SHE WOULD BE ALIVE.
I'M EMBOLIZING.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.208
WHOA. WHAT ABOUT VIOLET?

15:54.250 --> 15:57.041
WHAT ABOUT
WHAT SHE WOULD WANT?

15:57.083 --> 15:59.041
HOLD THESE.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.250
APPLY PRESSURE TO THE UTERUS.
DON'T MOVE.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.166
DELL, KEEP TALKING TO HER.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.000
I NEED A DECISION.
(Pete) YOU SAVE VIOLET.

16:08.041 --> 16:11.250
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO,
BUT YOU SAVE VIOLET.

16:11.291 --> 16:14.875
IS--IS IT REALLY
AND EITHER/OR?
IF YOU SAVE HER UTERUS,
SHE COULD STILL HAVE KIDS.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.041
YES.
BUT SHE COULD DIE.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.583
YES.
IF YOU TAKE OUT HER UTERUS--

16:18.625 --> 16:21.375
VIOLET LIVES, WHICH IS
THE GOAL HERE. VIOLET LIVES.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.041
(Sheldon) STOP TALKING OVER ME.
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
(cell phone beeping)

16:25.083 --> 16:27.375
THIS IS BIG. THIS--
I NEED A DECISION. PETE?

16:27.417 --> 16:29.250
SAVE VIOLET.
SHELDON?

16:29.291 --> 16:32.041
NO, SHE CHOSE ME. HE DOESN'T
HAVE--HE DOESN'T HAVE A--

16:32.083 --> 16:35.834
I WAS GOING TO AGREE
WITH YOU. SAVE VIOLET.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.417
COOPER?

16:38.458 --> 16:40.417
WAIT, NO. WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING HIM FOR?

16:40.458 --> 16:44.041
BECAUSE HE'S... HER COOPER.
TO VIOLET, HE'S HER COOPER.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.917
HE'S HER BEST FRIEND.
COOPER?

16:47.959 --> 16:50.709
YEAH, O--YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS?

16:50.750 --> 16:54.375
COOPER!
WHAT WOULD VIOLET WANT?

16:54.417 --> 16:57.166
SHE'D WANT YOU TO TRY
TO SAVE HER UTERUS.

16:57.208 --> 17:00.417
SHE'D WANT YOU TO AT LEAST
GIVE HER A SHOT

17:00.458 --> 17:02.083
AT WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.500
NO, NO.
NO, NO, YOU GUYS LOVE HER.
I KNOW HER.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.959
I KNOW EVERY FOOD SHE LIKES.
I KNOW EVERY THOUGHT

17:08.000 --> 17:10.959
SHE'S EVER HAD ABOUT A GUY,
INCLUDING THE TWO OF YOU.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.542
I KNOW... VIOLET.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.500
THIS IS WHAT SHE'D WANT.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.041
I'M GONNA EMBOLIZE.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.125
ADDISON...
(cell phone beeping)

17:22.166 --> 17:24.542
DAMN IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, COOPER?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.041
HEY, PETE--
I AM NOT ON CALL!

17:27.083 --> 17:29.834
I'M GONNA TAKE
SOMEONE'S HEAD OFF RIGHT NOW!

17:29.875 --> 17:32.041
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.125
ACCORDING TO SAM,
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.583
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE JOB?
I HAVE MY OWN PRACTICE.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.625
BUT IN LIGHT
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED,

17:38.667 --> 17:42.166
YEAH, WORKING WITH FRIENDS...
SEEMS GOOD--

17:42.208 --> 17:44.166
SEEMED GOOD--
BUT NOT TO YOU.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.417
WELL, NO, NO, I THINK WORKING
WITH FRIENDS COULD BE GREAT,

17:46.458 --> 17:49.208
HOWEVER--
YOU CAN'T FIGURE ME OUT.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.834
MY EMOTIONS DON'T FIT
INTO ONE OF YOUR BOXES,

17:51.875 --> 17:54.208
SO YOU THINK THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

17:54.250 --> 17:57.583
I DON'T HAVE ANY BOXES.
I'M JUST HERE TO HELP YOU.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.041
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW--

17:59.083 --> 18:01.917
TALKING ABOUT THE JOB
INSTEAD OF YOUR WIFE'S DEATH--

18:01.959 --> 18:03.667
WELL, THAT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY

18:03.709 --> 18:06.500
OF YOU AVOIDING DEALING
WITH SOMETHING PROFOUND.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY WIFE.

18:06.542 --> 18:10.792
YES, YOU TOLD ME WHAT SHE DIED
OF AND THAT IT WASN'T PAINFUL.
AND I TOLD YOU
WHAT I'M FEELING--

18:10.834 --> 18:13.542
ACTUALLY, YOU--YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE FEELING,

18:13.583 --> 18:16.041
NOT WHAT YOU WERE FEELING.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.041
YOU'RE HOLDING THINGS IN,
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT,

18:19.083 --> 18:21.125
WHAT HAPPENS IS,
EVENTUALLY IT FESTERS

18:21.166 --> 18:23.875
AND IT EXPLODES.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.959
IT'S LIKE ONE OF
YOUR INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

18:26.041 --> 18:29.125
SOMETIMES YOU LEAVE IT ALONE.
YOU LET THE BODY HEAL ITSELF.

18:29.166 --> 18:32.083
BUT YOUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT
WHEN TO TAKE ACTION

18:32.125 --> 18:34.083
IN ORDER TO PREVENT
FURTHER DAMAGE.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.083
WELL, THAT'S MY JOB, TOO.

18:36.125 --> 18:39.083
AND I LOOK AT YOU, AND, UH,
I CAN'T SEE LEAVING THIS ALONE.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.083
I THINK WE NEED TO ATTACK THIS
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE--

18:42.125 --> 18:45.375
NOT FOR ME OR SAM, FOR YOU.
ARE YOU MARRIED?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED?

18:45.417 --> 18:48.375
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE ISSUE.
BUT IT IS. I--I'M SURE
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL,

18:48.417 --> 18:50.000
AND YOU LEARNED ALL ABOUT

18:50.041 --> 18:52.041
THE BRAIN AND MEDICATIONS,
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.542
BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED,
IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD

18:54.583 --> 18:56.792
A RELATIONSHIP LIKE THAT,
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED

18:56.834 --> 19:00.375
TO SIT THERE AND TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING.

19:00.417 --> 19:02.041
I JUST WANT TO LISTEN.
AND JUDGE.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.041
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.
BUT YOU ARE.
YOU'RE JUDGING MY GRIEF.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:07.375 --> 19:11.000
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE QUALIFIED.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.709
COOPER FREEDMAN.
YOU PAGED ME FIVE TIMES.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.917
AM I THE ONLY PEDIATRICIAN
IN LOS ANGELES?

19:18.959 --> 19:20.500
I AM NOT ON CALL.

19:20.542 --> 19:23.333
YOU'RE THE ONLY PEDIATRICIAN
SHE WANTS.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.834
(cries)

19:25.875 --> 19:28.125
(whispers)
CALL SECURITY NOW.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.083
I HEARD ABOUT VIOLET
ON THE NEWS.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.041
THEY SAY SHE'S ALIVE.

19:35.083 --> 19:38.041
IS SHE ALIVE?

19:38.083 --> 19:40.125
OH, I HAD MY BABY.

19:40.166 --> 19:43.041
HE'S BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T HE?

19:43.083 --> 19:45.041
(chuckles)

19:48.959 --> 19:50.709
(chuckles)
WHEN VIOLET'S BETTER,

19:50.750 --> 19:53.250
I WANT HER TO SEE MY BABY.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.166
SHE'S GONNA BE SO SURPRISED.

19:55.208 --> 19:58.542
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS A GIRL,
BUT I HAD A BOY.

19:58.583 --> 20:02.125
AND, UM, IS HE HEALTHY?
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

20:02.166 --> 20:04.875
THE DOCTOR
WHO DELIVERED HIM?

20:04.917 --> 20:08.000
UM... HE'S FINE.
HE'S PERFECT.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.375
I JUST ASK 'CAUSE HE--
HE LOOKS A LITTLE PALE.

20:10.417 --> 20:14.166
UM, DO YOU MIND
IF I CHECK HIM OUT?
UM...

20:18.083 --> 20:19.125
PETE.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.125
HEY, PETE.
UM, KATIE HAD HER BABY.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.959
ISN'T THAT GREAT? UM...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.625
DOES HE LOOK SLIGHTLY PALE
TO YOU?

20:26.667 --> 20:29.792
YES, HE DOES.
COULD INDICATE HEMOLYSIS.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.792
YOU SHOULD CHECK HIM OUT.
YEAH.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.583
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
HEMOLYSIS?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.583
IT'S A BREAKDOWN
OF THE RED BLOOD CELLS.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.583
IT HAPPENS IN NEWBORNS.

20:37.625 --> 20:40.583
THEY USED TO DIE FROM IT,
BUT IT'S VERY TREATABLE NOW.

20:40.625 --> 20:45.041
WELL, HE--HE CRIES IF
ANYONE ELSE TOUCHES HIM, SO--

20:45.083 --> 20:48.041
WELL, KATIE, COOPER JUST WANTS
TO HELP. LOOK, I KNOW YOU.

20:48.083 --> 20:51.041
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
TO HAVE THIS BABY,

20:51.083 --> 20:55.000
HOW--HOW MUCH YOU WANT IT
TO BE HEALTHY.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.041
KATIE, LOOK AT ME.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.959
YOU NEED TO LET COOPER
MAKE SURE. IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.041
JUST--JUST HAVE
A LITTLE FAITH.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.041
(baby fussing)

21:13.375 --> 21:15.041
OKAY.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.542
YOU... BE CAREFUL.
HOLD HIS HEAD.

21:17.583 --> 21:21.625
HI THERE, LITTLE GUY.
LET'S CHECK YOU OUT.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.250
KATIE.

21:23.291 --> 21:26.291
I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.542
I GOT HIM. OKAY.
NO, THAT'S MY BABY.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.959
NO, THAT'S MY BABY.
YOU'RE TAKING MY BABY!
(Pete) NO.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.041
NO!
IT'S NOT YOUR BABY!

21:33.083 --> 21:35.875
YOU'RE STEALING MY BABY!
THAT'S MY BABY!

21:35.917 --> 21:38.166
THEY'RE STEALING MY BABY!
NO. NO!

21:38.208 --> 21:40.875
(crying) NO.
I GOTTA STOP ADDISON.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.875
PETE. PETE.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.041
PETE.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.500
GIVE ME MY BABY, PLEASE.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.959
PLEASE GIVE ME MY BABY.
PLEASE.

21:52.625 --> 21:56.000
INSERTING THE CATHETER
INTO THE UTERINE ARTERY.

21:56.041 --> 21:57.959
ADDISON, WE HAVE THE BABY.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.750
I WAS WRONG.
STOP THE EMBOLIZATION.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.458
JUST TAKE OUT HER UTERUS. DO
WHATEVER YOU CAN TO SAVE HER.
YOU HAVE THE BABY?

22:03.500 --> 22:06.041
KATIE SHOWED UP IN THE WAITING
ROOM. PETE'S GOT HIM.
THANK GOD.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.041
ADDISON, STOP.
IT'S TOO LATE, COOP.
I'VE ALREADY STARTED.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.709
IS IT WORKING?
IT'S THE BABY.
WE NEED YOU, COOP.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.625
THERE WAS BRUISING ON
THE ABDOMEN. I CHECKED HIS CRIT.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.375
HE'S MARKEDLY ANEMIC,
GOING INTO SHOCK.

22:16.417 --> 22:19.041
I THINK HIS SPLEEN MAY BE TORN
FROM BEING CUT OUT.
DID YOU GET AN ULTRASOUND?

22:19.083 --> 22:21.792
THERE'S FREE FLUID
IN THE ABDOMEN.
(Addison) HE NEEDS SURGERY NOW.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.041
I'M GONNA GO LOOK.
YOU--YOU CAN'T
JUST LEAVE VIOLET.

22:24.083 --> 22:27.375
I'M ALMOST DONE. YOU'VE DONE
THIS BEFORE. YOU CAN CLOSE.
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.500
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, NAI.
COOPER, CAN GET THE BABY,
ADDISON.

22:29.542 --> 22:32.041
COOPER IS NOT
A NEONATAL SURGEON. I AM.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.166
I HAVE A PEDS SURGEON
STANDING BY.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.083
NOT AS GOOD AS I AM.
CLEAR AN O.R.
(Naomi) ADDISON, STOP.

22:37.125 --> 22:41.750
LET ANOTHER DOCTOR DO THIS.
I CAN SAVE THEM BOTH, NAI.
I CAN SAVE THEM BOTH.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.125
COOP?

22:54.166 --> 22:56.583
IF I HAD ANSWERED
ONE OF THOSE PAGES...

22:56.625 --> 23:00.709
OH, MY GOD.
HOW MUCH TIME DID I WASTE?

23:00.750 --> 23:03.000
HOW LONG WAS SHE WAITING?

23:07.083 --> 23:09.041
(Sam) HEY, HOW'D IT GO?

23:09.083 --> 23:11.333
OOH. NOT GOOD?

23:11.375 --> 23:14.166
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO VIOLET.
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SEE HER SOME MORE.

23:14.208 --> 23:16.792
NO, SAM. I'M DONE.
THAT WOMAN...

23:16.834 --> 23:18.208
I'M SORRY.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.417
I DON'T WANT TO TRASH
YOUR NEW COLLEAGUE.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.041
IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY.

23:22.083 --> 23:24.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SPYING?

23:24.083 --> 23:26.583
UH, YEAH.
OH, MY...

23:26.625 --> 23:30.041
(chuckles)
I FORGOT
HOW BIG MAYA GOT.

23:30.083 --> 23:33.041
OH, SHE'S STARTING
KINDERGARTEN THIS FALL.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.458
I'M A LUCKY GUY.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.000
YEAH.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.000
NO. I MEAN IT.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.792
I'M... A LUCKY GUY.

23:40.834 --> 23:43.166
IT'S LUCK THAT NAOMI
WAS MY LAB PARTNER,

23:43.208 --> 23:46.166
LUCK THAT SHE WENT OUT WITH ME
FOR THAT FIRST TIME,

23:46.208 --> 23:49.208
LUCK THAT SHE SAID YES
WHEN I PROPOSED.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.667
I'M JUST LUCKY
THAT MAYA'S HEALTHY

23:51.709 --> 23:54.041
AND THAT WE'RE HAPPY

23:54.083 --> 23:57.250
AND THAT WE HAVE
THIS LIFE...

23:59.542 --> 24:01.041
WHEN YOU'RE--

24:01.083 --> 24:03.041
YEAH.

24:06.792 --> 24:11.208
I'M A LUCKY GUY.
IT'S JUST LUCK.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.959
SHE'S THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.333
THAT'S NOT LUCK.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.333
THAT'S... SOMETHING ELSE.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.583
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

24:22.625 --> 24:25.917
I'M GONNA BE FINE, SAM.
I AM.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.959
HEY, PETE.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.291
YOU'RE STANDING THERE SO LONG.
YOU THINK SHE WOULDN'T SEE YOU?

24:32.333 --> 24:35.291
SHE WANTS YOU TO COME IN. SHE
WANTS US TO TAKE TURNS READING.
ALL RIGHT.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.875
DO YOU HAVE A PATIENT?
NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.000
OKAY.
UH, DO YOU WANT TO WAIT?

24:40.041 --> 24:42.458
NO, WE'LL TALK LATER.
I'M FINE.
ALL RIGHT.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.709
(Sam with silly voice)
HEY, MAYA.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.083
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

24:47.125 --> 24:50.291
(laughs
and speaks indistinctly)

24:50.333 --> 24:53.709
(Sam and Naomi
speaking indistinctly)

24:53.750 --> 24:55.917
OKAY, ONE MORE SUTURE.

24:55.959 --> 24:58.041
(monitor beeping rapidly)

24:58.083 --> 25:00.041
PULSE OX IS DROPPING.
CHECK HER PROBE.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.959
THE PROBE'S FINE.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.542
BUT SHE'S TACHY
AT 130. 140.

25:04.583 --> 25:07.041
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS SHE--IS SHE BLEEDING?
I DON'T KNOW.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.750
(monitor beeping erratically)
SHE'S IN V-FIB.

25:08.792 --> 25:11.750
CRASH CART.
PADDLES CHARGED TO 200.

25:11.792 --> 25:14.291
EPI AND LIDO. LET'S GO.
CHARGE.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.917
CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

25:16.959 --> 25:20.041
ANYTHING?
NO PULSE.
SHE'S STILL IN FIB.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.041
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

25:22.083 --> 25:23.500
I DON'T KNOW.

25:23.542 --> 25:27.125
UNRESPONSIVE... V-FIB...
BLEEDING...

25:27.166 --> 25:30.959
ELECTROLYTES...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.125
TURN HER ON HER SIDE.

25:33.166 --> 25:36.041
GIVE ME A 60cc SYRINGE
AND A SPINAL NEEDLE.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.583
GOT IT.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.000
TURN HER ON HER BACK.
PADDLES. 360.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.041
CLEAR.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.166
(paddles thunk)

26:04.208 --> 26:05.792
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:05.834 --> 26:07.458
SHE'S GOT A RHYTHM.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.041
(man) AND A PULSE.

26:09.083 --> 26:12.709
PULSE OX IS COMING UP.
86. 90. 92.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.709
I DID IT.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.625
I DID IT.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.625
I DID IT.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.709
DELL, GET ADDISON.

26:22.750 --> 26:26.083
(monitor beeping rapidly)
GET ADDISON NOW.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.625
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

26:32.667 --> 26:34.041
GRADE 4 SPLENIC LACERATION.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.041
I'M TRYING TO PRESERVE
THE SPLEEN.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.041
VASCULAR CLAMP.

26:38.083 --> 26:40.041
AND THE ARGON.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.542
RIGHT THERE.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.625
NAOMI SAYS YOU NEED
TO COME BACK, NOW.

26:44.667 --> 26:48.417
NOW. VIOLET IS BLEEDING
FROM HER NOSE AND MOUTH.

26:48.458 --> 26:50.417
IT WON'T STOP.
SHE'S NOT CLOTTING?
DAMN.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.041
NAOMI SAID NOW.
I HEAR YOU, DELL.

26:53.083 --> 26:55.125
I CAN FINISH.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.291
ADDISON.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.291
OKAY, LET ME JUST CLAMP THIS.
GOT IT.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.375
CAUTERIZE
ANY REMAINING BLEEDERS, GENTLY,

27:01.417 --> 27:04.291
BUT WAIT FOR ME TO COME BACK
TO SET THE VICRYL MESH.

27:04.333 --> 27:08.166
DO NOT KILL THIS BABY
WHILE I AM GONE.

27:08.208 --> 27:09.375
ADDISON...

27:09.417 --> 27:11.000
NOT NOW.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.375
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27:12.417 --> 27:14.792
NOT NOW.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.041
I KNOW. I KNOW.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.375
I SHOULD...
TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.083
(Addison)
WHAT'S HER FIBRINOGEN LEVEL?

27:28.125 --> 27:30.041
(Naomi)
IT'S LESS THAN 100.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.875
SHE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO PLATELETS, F.F.P.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.583
PREPARE ANTITHROMBIN.
(Dell) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

27:35.625 --> 27:38.375
SHE'S NOT CLOTTING, AND YOU WANT
TO GIVE HER AN ANTICOAGULANT?
ADDISON--

27:38.417 --> 27:40.000
WITH ALL THE BLOOD LOSS,

27:40.041 --> 27:41.917
HER COAGULATION SYSTEM
IS WORKING OVERTIME.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.291
HOPEFULLY
WITH THE ANTICOAGULANT,

27:43.333 --> 27:45.291
IT WILL STOP THE CASCADE,
AND HER OWN CLOTTING

27:45.333 --> 27:47.792
WILL START UP AGAIN.
OR IT WILL KILL HER.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.041
IT'S HER ONLY SHOT.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.917
PREPARE THE ANTITHROMBIN.
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE BABY.

27:52.959 --> 27:56.041
YOU CAN ADMINISTER
THE A.T.3.
ADDISON, YOU BETTER
BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.458
IF SHE DIES--
DO IT, NAI.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.125
WE HAD A FIGHT...

28:17.166 --> 28:19.166
THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED.

28:19.208 --> 28:22.166
WELL, WE HAD A FIGHT
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT,

28:22.208 --> 28:27.041
BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED
WAS OUR WORST FIGHT.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.166
SHE SAID THINGS...

28:29.208 --> 28:35.333
WE SAID THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.583
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING.

28:37.625 --> 28:40.041
THE ALARM WENT OFF.
I--HER ALARM WENT OFF.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.166
I WAS STILL PISSED.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.834
I TURNED IT OFF...

28:44.875 --> 28:50.250
AND SHE WAS JUST LAYING THERE
IGNORING ME.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.250
AND IT PISSED ME OFF.

28:52.291 --> 28:55.250
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.
I BRUSHED MY TEETH.

28:55.291 --> 28:58.625
I WAS TRYING TO GET HER
TO TALK TO ME,

28:58.667 --> 29:01.667
AND... SHE WAS
JUST LAYING THERE.

29:01.709 --> 29:06.917
SO I CALLED HER A BITCH.

29:06.959 --> 29:08.917
I CALLED HER A BITCH,

29:08.959 --> 29:14.000
AND STILL,
SHE JUST LAY THERE, SILENT.

29:14.041 --> 29:17.250
SO I RIPPED THE COVERS OFF...

29:17.291 --> 29:20.250
I RIPPED THE COVERS OFF
TO MAKE HER GET OUT OF BED

29:20.291 --> 29:22.291
AND TALK TO ME.

29:22.333 --> 29:25.041
SHE WOULDN'T TALK TO ME...

29:25.083 --> 29:26.750
BECAUSE SHE WAS DEAD.

29:26.792 --> 29:30.125
FIVE MINUTES,
I ARGUED WITH MY WIFE,

29:30.166 --> 29:33.625
AND SHE WAS LAYING THERE,
DEAD...

29:33.667 --> 29:37.208
AND...

29:37.250 --> 29:39.250
I DIDN'T KNOW IT.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.875
WELL, YOU--YOU JUST SAID
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, PETE.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.875
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.041
YOUR ANGER, IT--
IT DIDN'T KILL YOUR WIFE.

29:51.083 --> 29:53.709
IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.458
PEOPLE FIGHT.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.917
I HATED MY WIFE.

30:00.291 --> 30:02.500
SEE? THAT'S THE THING.

30:05.083 --> 30:08.875
I HATED HER.

30:08.917 --> 30:11.875
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT ME.

30:11.917 --> 30:14.875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MAN I AM,

30:14.917 --> 30:18.041
WHAT KIND OF HUSBAND I AM.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.083
(voice breaking) WAS.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.083
BUT I HATED MY WIFE.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.083
SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY

30:24.125 --> 30:27.083
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME
AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT...

30:27.125 --> 30:30.166
IT'S BECAUSE MY WIFE IS DEAD,

30:30.208 --> 30:34.000
AND ALL I CAN THINK IS...

30:36.959 --> 30:38.959
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.
