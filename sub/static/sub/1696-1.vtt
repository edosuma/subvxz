00:29.287 --> 00:33.383
D'ya hear that?
Sold out in Los Angeles.

00:34.459 --> 00:37.326
Needle in finger.
Sharp, shooting pain.

00:37.395 --> 00:38.862
l'm sorry, Fermine.

00:38.930 --> 00:41.797
That's OK. l kiss it.
All better. All right.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.433
Look at you, you look gor_guss.

00:46.504 --> 00:50.372
You're gonna look beautiful in your finale.
Do it with me. Come on, now.

00:50.442 --> 00:53.275
Work it out, work it out.
And pop it!

00:57.449 --> 00:59.940
Tushie tear.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.714
Awkward moment.
Time to go.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.321
_ Don't look at my booty.
_ No danger there, partner.

01:07.392 --> 01:09.792
l love you, Hannah Montana.

01:09.861 --> 01:14.195
Do you mind? l am on the phone here,
all right. l've got a life too, you know.

01:14.265 --> 01:17.393
And l'd appreciate it
if l could have one conversation

01:17.469 --> 01:20.563
without hearing the words
''Hannah Montana.''

01:20.638 --> 01:24.597
Yeah, that's right, girl.
l know Hannah Montana.

01:24.676 --> 01:27.144
And l got two incredible tickets
for tomorrow night.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.908
Great. We'll see you then.

01:29.981 --> 01:32.245
l need two incredible seats
for tomorrow night.

01:32.317 --> 01:35.013
_ Sorry, l'm sold out.
_ Dad?

01:35.086 --> 01:38.317
Think of it this way, Miley.
He goes out with her, they fall in love,

01:38.389 --> 01:40.482
they get married, he moves out.

01:41.259 --> 01:43.523
You've got the tickets.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.728
_ Hello?
_ lt's me. l'm landing in 20 seconds!

01:48.800 --> 01:52.236
Great. Lilly alert in 1 8 seconds.

01:52.303 --> 01:53.600
She's your best friend.

01:53.671 --> 01:56.538
Sooner or later you'll have to tell her
you're Hannah Montana.

01:56.608 --> 01:59.475
_ l pick later.
_ Nine seconds. Get the juice.

01:59.544 --> 02:01.444
_ Got it.
_ Good. Three...

02:01.513 --> 02:03.003
_ Two...
_ One.

02:03.081 --> 02:07.643
Guess who just landed two tickets
to the hottest concert in town?

02:08.119 --> 02:14.820
Miley, you and l _ l being your best friend _
are going to see the one, the only...

02:14.893 --> 02:17.054
Hannah Montana!

02:19.964 --> 02:23.365
You're not screaming.
Why aren't you screaming?

02:23.434 --> 02:27.734
Believe me.
She's screaming on the inside.

03:27.365 --> 03:30.823
l just don't get it.
Why won't you go to the concert with me?

03:30.902 --> 03:36.431
lt's just that... l really want to spend
some quality time with my brother.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.967
Quality time with your brother?

03:42.747 --> 03:46.148
OK, if you don't want to tell me,
l guess there's nothing l can do

03:46.217 --> 03:52.053
except go through life wondering what l did
to deserve being hurt so badly by my...

03:52.123 --> 03:55.854
_ Just stop. l just can't go, OK?
_ OK. That's fine.

03:55.927 --> 03:57.986
Hey, Miley.
How's it goin'?

04:02.267 --> 04:06.328
Pretty good. Just gettin' some ketchup
for my burger. l see you like mayonnaise.

04:06.404 --> 04:08.998
Never tried that on a burger.
Maybe l should...

04:09.073 --> 04:12.236
Miley, Miley, Miley...

04:15.213 --> 04:19.012
You know, what a lot of people
don't know is... is...

04:19.083 --> 04:22.780
it's also a wonderful moisturizer.

04:22.854 --> 04:25.118
Here. lsn't that lovely?

04:25.189 --> 04:27.885
Moisturizer.
You're pretty funny.

04:30.094 --> 04:33.188
My hand does feel softer.

04:34.832 --> 04:39.599
l know. He is so hot.
And l'm so lame.

04:39.671 --> 04:43.232
He's the one who believed
ketchup was a moisturizer.

04:43.308 --> 04:46.766
Miley, you've been totally crushing
on Johnny Collins for months.

04:46.844 --> 04:52.749
He thought you were funny. This is your
chance. He's sitting right there. Let's move.

04:52.817 --> 04:55.149
l just can't do it.

04:55.219 --> 05:01.681
Yes, you can. Miley, you're smart,
you're funny and you're totally cute.

05:01.759 --> 05:05.627
And now,
you have my lucky bracelet.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.725
_ OK.
_ Wait, booger check.

05:09.801 --> 05:11.769
You're so gross.

05:11.836 --> 05:13.827
All clear.
Good to go.

05:15.239 --> 05:18.072
Seriously, dude.
lt really does soften your skin.

05:18.843 --> 05:21.175
Hi, Johnny.

05:24.115 --> 05:28.711
Hey, Amber, Ashley.
We were gonna sit there.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.651
Well, isn't that just too bad?

05:30.722 --> 05:33.953
But don't worry. There are seats
over there by the trash cans.

05:34.025 --> 05:36.186
At the losers' table.

05:40.665 --> 05:44.328
Hey, Amber. l think
it might be time to pluck the 'stache.

05:44.402 --> 05:46.029
And, Ashley,

05:46.104 --> 05:49.540
is that a zit
or are you growing a new head?

05:50.708 --> 05:52.539
Gross!

05:59.884 --> 06:02.978
OK, we didn't get those seats.
Minor setback.

06:03.054 --> 06:06.922
But the good news is
we have better seats for Hannah Montana.

06:06.991 --> 06:11.951
l'm sorry, it's just that
l don't like Hannah Montana.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.191
What?

06:14.265 --> 06:17.860
Hey, baby, how you doin'?

06:17.935 --> 06:21.462
Oliver Oken,
and may l say, you two are smokin'?

06:21.539 --> 06:24.235
_ ln your dreams.
_ l'm countin' on that.

06:24.308 --> 06:26.799
Hey, slick.

06:26.878 --> 06:28.140
Hey.

06:28.212 --> 06:31.773
Oh, yeah.
She wants me.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.510
Oliver, you're not gonna believe this.

06:33.584 --> 06:36.576
Miley says
she doesn't like Hannah Montana.

06:36.654 --> 06:38.144
What?

06:38.222 --> 06:42.283
Hannah Montana is a goddess.
l worship at her feet.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.797
ln fact, FYl, someday
l'm gonna be Mr. Hannah Montana.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.059
Gonna watch her
every minute of every day.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.658
Protect her from any obsessed fans.

06:51.736 --> 06:57.299
Every night, l'll shampoo and condition
that beautiful blonde hair.

06:58.142 --> 07:01.202
Oliver, l say this because l care about you:

07:01.279 --> 07:03.770
Get some help!

07:05.783 --> 07:09.742
Miley, don't make me go see my favorite
singer without my best friend.

07:09.821 --> 07:15.691
lf you don't take this ticket, l'll end up going
to the concert with Mr. Hannah Montana.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.456
You have an extra ticket
to Hannah Montana?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.725
That was really loud, wasn't it?

07:31.042 --> 07:37.811
Hey, Dad. l'm really nervous about my date
and, well, l'm just gonna say this:

07:37.882 --> 07:42.717
There is nobody in the world whose advice
l trust and respect more than you.

07:43.221 --> 07:45.314
Son, l'm not loaning you money.

07:45.389 --> 07:48.722
What? What?
ls that what you think this is about?

07:48.793 --> 07:52.092
Dad, l am hurt.

07:52.163 --> 07:54.791
This has nothing to do
with borrowing money from you.

07:54.866 --> 07:58.358
l was actually kinda hoping
more for an outright gift.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.963
l gave you the gift of life, son.
Don't push it.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.434
_ Honey, what happened?
_ Hannah Montana happened.

08:07.512 --> 08:09.639
You mean the kids at school found out?

08:09.714 --> 08:13.480
No, this was just about a ticket
to see Hannah Montana.

08:13.551 --> 08:16.111
What if they found out
l was Hannah Montana?

08:16.187 --> 08:19.588
_ No one would treat me the same.
_ l bet Lilly would.

08:19.657 --> 08:22.683
Are you kidding?
She's Hannah's biggest fan.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.457
lf she knew the truth,
l'd never be just Miley again.

08:26.531 --> 08:28.624
_ Baby doll.
_ l'm taking a walk on the beach.

08:28.699 --> 08:30.132
Now, hold on just a minute.

08:30.201 --> 08:36.071
First, let's get this French fry out of
your hair before the seagulls attack you.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.370
Boy, the sucker is in there, too.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.438
Second of all, l know you're concerned
that if Lilly finds out the truth

08:43.514 --> 08:47.109
that she won't treat you the same.
She's still your best bud.

08:47.185 --> 08:51.281
You need to trust that.
At least think about telling her.

08:51.355 --> 08:54.256
OK.
Not gonna happen.

08:56.961 --> 09:00.954
Dad, l can only hope that when
l'm a father l can give my children...

09:01.032 --> 09:03.398
_ No money.
_ Didn't think so.

09:37.235 --> 09:39.635
Thank you, Los Angeles!

09:40.838 --> 09:44.706
Hannah Montana.

09:44.775 --> 09:47.938
_ There you go.
_ Thank you.

09:48.012 --> 09:51.140
Hey, Joh...st another fan.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.207
Hi. Could you sign this to Johnny?

09:54.285 --> 09:56.617
lt's not me.
lt's my little brother.

09:56.687 --> 09:57.881
He really likes you.

09:57.955 --> 09:59.616
Not that l don't. l do.

09:59.690 --> 10:02.955
But, you know,
he wanted me to get it, so l'm gettin' it.

10:03.027 --> 10:07.054
Yeah, so if you could just sign that
to Johnny. My little brother.

10:07.131 --> 10:08.621
_ There you go.
_ Thanks.

10:08.699 --> 10:13.227
_ Hey, really soft hands.
_ Thanks, it's ketchup.

10:13.304 --> 10:14.703
Bye.

10:14.772 --> 10:19.209
Thanks, guys. Be sure and pick up
a record and a T_shirt in the lobby.

10:19.277 --> 10:21.040
He is so cute!

10:21.112 --> 10:23.740
Honey, at your age,
there's only two things that are cute _

10:23.814 --> 10:27.477
squirrels and little puppy dogs.

10:27.551 --> 10:32.147
l tell you what. l hate wearin' this thing.
lt's like kissing your great_aunt Clara.

10:32.957 --> 10:36.654
Hey. Great show tonight.
l'll go check on the limo.

10:36.727 --> 10:38.854
Your mama would have been
so proud of you.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.157
Thanks, Dad.

10:52.343 --> 10:54.470
Higher, Oliver, l'm almost in.

10:54.545 --> 10:59.539
There is no ''higher.''
You're already standing on my head!

10:59.617 --> 11:01.744
Jump, you idiot. Jump!

11:13.764 --> 11:15.322
Not good!

11:23.641 --> 11:26.269
And she sticks the landing!

11:29.547 --> 11:33.244
Hannah Montana's hot dogs!

11:33.317 --> 11:35.547
Hannah Montana's scarf!

11:39.657 --> 11:41.318
Hannah Montana!

11:42.893 --> 11:45.726
Whoever you are, get out of here now
or l'll call security.

11:45.796 --> 11:48.822
Wait, no. l'm sorry.
l was just looking for a souvenir.

11:48.899 --> 11:52.995
My name's Lilly Truscott,
and l'm a huge fan.

12:10.454 --> 12:12.945
Did you just shove pie in your face?

12:13.023 --> 12:18.290
lt's not a real pie.
lt's a foaming facial wash...

12:18.896 --> 12:20.420
pie.

12:21.732 --> 12:25.327
_ What's wrong with your voice?
_ That happens after every concert.

12:26.137 --> 12:29.106
You give so much!

12:29.673 --> 12:31.334
l just wish Miley were here.

12:31.409 --> 12:34.344
Who's Miley? l don't know Miley.
That's a strange name.

12:34.412 --> 12:36.312
She's my best friend.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.316
Right! Well, then,
why don't you go get her?

12:40.384 --> 12:42.375
Great idea. l'll call her.

12:42.453 --> 12:47.789
No! Cellphones don't really work in here.
lt has to do with the walls and the cement...

12:51.529 --> 12:54.259
OK, they must have fixed it.

12:57.101 --> 13:03.165
_ Aren't you gonna get that?
_ No. l'm talking to you. That'd be rude.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.970
OK, she's not home.

13:06.043 --> 13:09.012
Wow, that was weird.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.571
Why don't l just give you
an autograph for her?

13:12.650 --> 13:15.881
What about me?
l'm the one who loves you.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.589
You're much paler in person.

13:21.659 --> 13:25.561
Yeah, l am. Gosh, it was really fun meeting
you guys, but l've really got to go.

13:25.629 --> 13:30.464
Wait! Can't l shampoo and condition
your beautiful blonde hair?

13:30.835 --> 13:33.565
No. But you can take this towel.

13:34.071 --> 13:36.062
Hannah Montana's towel.

13:38.342 --> 13:42.005
lt's OK! None of my blood
got on the towel!

13:45.316 --> 13:47.944
Well, l guess l'm leavin', too.

13:48.018 --> 13:50.009
OK.

13:50.087 --> 13:53.215
Without even a towel as a souvenir.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.588
Bye_bye.

13:55.659 --> 14:00.961
Nothing but my memories
which will fade too, too quickly.

14:01.031 --> 14:04.194
All right, all right. Here.

14:05.269 --> 14:06.634
Oh, my gosh.

14:06.704 --> 14:09.764
The actual scarf
you wore on the actual stage.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.331
l can't believe it!
This is so...

14:12.409 --> 14:16.709
l have a lucky bracelet just like that.
l loaned it to my best friend yesterday.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.715
Of course,
mine says ''Lilly'' on the back.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.678
Just like that.

14:29.727 --> 14:31.957
Ta_da.

14:37.935 --> 14:41.098
Lilly, l know you're upset l didn't tell you.

14:41.171 --> 14:45.574
But you cannot just freeze me out
like this. Please talk to me.

14:47.344 --> 14:51.781
l thought we were friends.
l thought we told each other everything.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.979
But l guess l was wrong, since you kept
just about the biggest secret in the world,

14:56.053 --> 15:00.114
Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana!

15:00.624 --> 15:05.789
OK, well, other than that,
did you enjoy the concert?

15:07.531 --> 15:12.559
That's right, l happen to be
real tight with Hannah Montana.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.737
Hey, Hannah. l thought my lady here
could use a little souvenir.

15:16.807 --> 15:18.900
Jackson, get out of here.

15:18.976 --> 15:23.743
For you.
Told you we were tight.

15:26.483 --> 15:28.212
l am so out of here.

15:28.285 --> 15:29.980
Lilly, please, wait!

15:32.256 --> 15:34.349
l wanted to tell you.

15:34.425 --> 15:37.451
lt's just that l was afraid.

15:37.528 --> 15:39.519
Afraid of what?

15:39.597 --> 15:42.623
l don't know.
l thought maybe once you knew

15:42.700 --> 15:45.362
you won't want to be my friend anymore.

15:45.436 --> 15:48.564
And you'd like Hannah Montana
more than you like me.

15:48.639 --> 15:55.408
That's what you thought? That could never
happen, Miley. Don't you know that?

15:56.246 --> 15:58.908
Yeah. l do.

15:59.984 --> 16:01.781
OK, no more secrets.

16:01.852 --> 16:06.482
And to prove it, l'll show you something
l've never shown to any other friend.

16:09.026 --> 16:11.859
Wait till you see this.

16:17.835 --> 16:20.269
Why am l standing in your closet?

16:20.337 --> 16:22.828
Because, behind my closet is...

16:23.807 --> 16:25.069
my closet!

16:37.054 --> 16:42.458
lt's like a dream.
A beautiful, beautiful dream.

16:43.260 --> 16:46.388
OK, dream's over.
l've got to have these.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.091
_ Wait, there's more.
_ Another closet?

16:53.871 --> 16:55.634
_ What size shoe do you wear?
_ l'm a five.

16:55.706 --> 16:58.869
l'm a six, but l'll squeeze!

17:00.911 --> 17:03.573
Wait till Amber and Ashley find out.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.047
_ What?
_ Well, we have to tell them.

17:06.116 --> 17:10.143
Here's my cell. Take a picture of me
in front of Hannah Montana's clothes.

17:10.220 --> 17:13.189
No! No one else can see this stuff.

17:13.257 --> 17:15.020
Are you crazy?
Why not?

17:15.092 --> 17:17.856
Once people know l'm Hannah,
they won't treat me the same.

17:17.928 --> 17:22.126
That's the point. l'm talking
mega_popularity here for both of us.

17:22.199 --> 17:25.191
Think about Johnny Collins.
He'd be yours if he knew.

17:25.269 --> 17:28.761
- No!
- How can you be so selfish?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.933
lf you were really my best friend
you'd want this for me.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.944
lf you were my best friend
you'd understand why l can't do it.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.412
Come on, cut me some slack, Hannah.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.779
''Hannah''?
l knew this would happen.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.184
Did l say ''Hannah''?
l didn't mean that. lt was a mistake.

17:44.254 --> 17:46.779
No! The mistake was trusting you.

17:50.661 --> 17:56.429
That girl tonight really dug me, Dad.
l think it was the guns.

17:58.469 --> 18:03.998
Hey, Lilly. l think things will be a lot better
here now that you know our little secret.

18:04.508 --> 18:06.567
Did you see the way she ignored you?

18:06.643 --> 18:13.105
Well, l'm sorry, but that is no way to treat
a man of your compassion, sensitivity...

18:13.183 --> 18:15.174
Still no money?

18:18.455 --> 18:20.889
l am so mad!

18:20.958 --> 18:24.621
And so you're gonna take it out
on my ice_cream sundae?

18:24.695 --> 18:26.890
_ You want to talk about it?
_ No.

18:28.165 --> 18:30.633
OK.

18:30.701 --> 18:32.601
You had a fight.

18:32.669 --> 18:34.762
She left your place.

18:34.838 --> 18:37.966
And now you sit
and stuff your face.

18:38.041 --> 18:41.602
You got the processed sugar blues.

18:41.678 --> 18:44.442
Stop! That's the worst song
you've ever written.

18:44.515 --> 18:46.949
She obviously doesn't remember
the potty_training song.

18:47.017 --> 18:49.008
l like to sing,
l like to dance.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.350
But l can't do it
with poopy in my pants...

18:51.421 --> 18:54.390
Dad! This is so not funny.

18:54.458 --> 18:57.222
Everything l was afraid
that would happen happened.

18:57.294 --> 19:00.320
She found out who l was
and now it's ruined everything.

19:00.397 --> 19:03.628
You don't know that for sure, Mile.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.500
Things could change.
Just give it some time.

19:07.571 --> 19:10.438
_ Group hug.
_ Gotta go.

19:18.749 --> 19:20.341
Turn.

19:23.253 --> 19:26.450
l don't know. l think it makes me look
a little big around the hips.

19:26.523 --> 19:29.083
Please, let's not blame the dress.

19:30.761 --> 19:33.457
_ Hey, guys. Sorry...
_ Whoo, doggies!

19:34.832 --> 19:36.766
Daddy.

19:36.834 --> 19:39.632
He's finally cracked.

19:40.270 --> 19:45.833
You know what, son? l like it,
but l don't think it goes with the shoes.

19:45.909 --> 19:48.605
OK, fine, you take your little cracks.

19:48.679 --> 19:53.013
But you weren't here and he needed help
with the dress and he said he'd pay me.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.551
So this is what you get.

19:55.619 --> 19:59.555
Next time try something
with sleeves... and deodorant.

19:59.623 --> 20:02.421
lf you got it, flaunt it.

20:03.026 --> 20:07.053
Which reminds me _ l got a little blue
sequined number waiting for me. Enjoy.

20:09.399 --> 20:11.560
OK, Fermine.
How much do l owe you?

20:11.635 --> 20:13.967
Kid works cheap.
He did it for $ 20.

20:14.972 --> 20:16.837
Daddy!
You made him do that?

20:16.907 --> 20:18.772
The boy said he needed some money.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.811
l thought l might as well
get a chuckle out of it.

20:28.385 --> 20:29.909
Lilly alert.

20:34.224 --> 20:37.955
Fermine, why don't we step out on the patio
and give these girls some privacy?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.759
OK, but l'm gonna need some sunscreen.
My skin is like a baby's bottom.

20:41.832 --> 20:44.062
Little too much information, cowboy.

20:44.134 --> 20:47.797
Ooh, look at me.
Giddy_up, partner. Yippee_ki_yay.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.839
Giddy_up.
Yippee_ki_yay.

20:53.076 --> 20:55.408
Hey. Can l talk to you?

20:55.812 --> 20:58.110
Who? Miley or Hannah?

20:59.950 --> 21:01.076
Miley.

21:01.151 --> 21:03.381
Well, she's not talking to you right now.

21:03.453 --> 21:06.286
Wait, Miley,
l'm sorry l called you ''Hannah.''

21:06.356 --> 21:10.383
But that was major news. You gotta
give me a little time to get used to it.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.155
What happens if you can't?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.925
What about the next time
you get dissed by Amber and Ashley?

21:14.998 --> 21:16.863
Are you sure you won't want to tell them?

21:16.934 --> 21:22.634
Of course l'll want to, but l won't. And you
know why? Because you're my best friend.

21:22.706 --> 21:27.143
And when l was sitting in my room all
upset, you're the one l wanted to talk to.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.144
Not Hannah Montana.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.950
Well, l guess l've said everything.

21:36.019 --> 21:38.954
So see ya.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.450
Here l go.

21:44.528 --> 21:46.860
Headed for the door.

21:46.930 --> 21:51.697
After making the best apology
l could possibly think of.

21:56.473 --> 21:59.533
Still hoping she forgives me.

22:00.978 --> 22:04.106
Halfway there.

22:04.181 --> 22:06.843
You are such a drama queen.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.782
Hugs?

22:15.559 --> 22:18.892
l'm so not getting paid enough for this.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.355
Neither am l.

22:28.271 --> 22:31.331
_ We were in the first row.
_ And Hannah smiled right at us.

22:31.408 --> 22:32.773
She really did.

22:32.843 --> 22:38.907
Big deal. You see this towel? She gave it
to me in her dressing room. She really did.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.780
Yeah, and she gave me this sandwich.

22:41.852 --> 22:44.013
You're pathetic.

22:46.890 --> 22:50.326
_ lt's true.
_ lgnore them, Oliver. They're not worth it.

22:50.394 --> 22:55.525
Wait a minute. He's telling the truth.
And she gave Lilly something too.

22:56.967 --> 22:59.663
_ What are you doing?
_ You'll see.

23:00.753 --> 23:04.086
_ That's Hannah Montana's scarf!
_ From the concert!

23:04.157 --> 23:06.352
Yeah, Hannah gave it to her.

23:06.426 --> 23:11.022
But you know what? You guys are much
cooler than me. You should have it.

23:11.764 --> 23:13.664
Oh, my gosh.

23:13.733 --> 23:15.064
Hey! l want that!

23:15.134 --> 23:17.068
No! Stop!

23:17.136 --> 23:19.297
_ Why did you do that?
_ She gave it to me!

23:19.372 --> 23:22.569
l think l know.
Hey, everybody!

23:22.642 --> 23:25.236
lt's Hannah Montana's scarf!
