00:34.717 --> 00:36.651
HEY, MAN.
HEY.

00:36.719 --> 00:37.802
WHAT'S WITH THE BAG?

00:37.870 --> 00:39.337
I'M THINKING ABOUT
JOINING THAT NEW GYM

00:39.405 --> 00:41.039
THAT OPENED UP
DOWN THE BLOCK.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.274
OH.

00:42.341 --> 00:43.507
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
IF I CAN GET SOMEONE

00:43.575 --> 00:46.477
TO JOIN WITH ME, WE GET
A HALF-OFF MEMBERSHIP.

00:46.545 --> 00:49.698
I WOULD, BUT I'M STILL WORKING
ON THE "BEFORE" PICTURE.

00:53.051 --> 00:56.087
PALMER, HEFFERNAN,
GET IN HERE.

00:56.155 --> 00:56.755
WHAT'S HE WANT TO
SEE US FOR?

00:56.823 --> 00:58.339
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:58.407 --> 01:00.008
I DROPPED A PACKAGE, AND I SIGNED
YOUR NAME ON THE INCIDENT REPORT,

01:00.075 --> 01:03.778
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY HE WANTS TO SEE ME.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.398
SIR, BEFORE YOU LAY INTO
PALMER ABOUT THE BROKEN PACKAGE,

01:06.465 --> 01:08.933
I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT
WASN'T HIM. IT WAS ME.

01:09.001 --> 01:13.438
YOU SEE, MY WIFE, SHE'S
GOT, UH, BLADDER ISSUES.

01:13.506 --> 01:16.291
UM, YOU MAY NOT
KNOW THIS,

01:16.359 --> 01:19.294
BUT, WELL, OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF YEARS,

01:19.362 --> 01:23.131
I DEVELOPED A LITTLE BIT
OF A DRINKING PROBLEM.

01:23.199 --> 01:23.965
REALLY?

01:24.033 --> 01:26.317
GET OUT OF HERE.

01:26.385 --> 01:30.054
YEAH, AND, WELL, APPARENTLY AT
THE COMPANY PICNIC LAST WEEKEND,

01:30.122 --> 01:33.091
I CROSSED THE LINE
WITH A COUPLE OF THE WIVES.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.777
HEY, WHO DIDN'T, MAN?
IT'S A PICNIC. WHOO!

01:37.363 --> 01:39.464
THE THING IS, THE LEGAL
DEPARTMENT AND I

01:39.532 --> 01:43.801
HAVE DECIDED THAT TOMORROW, I'M
GONNA CHECK MYSELF INTO A REHAB CENTER

01:43.869 --> 01:45.803
JUST OUTSIDE OF SYRACUSE.

01:45.871 --> 01:48.540
NICE.

01:48.607 --> 01:49.740
I GOT A SWEATSHIRT
FROM SYRACUSE.

01:49.808 --> 01:51.309
I'D LOAN IT TO YOU,
BUT IT'S A DOUBLE XL.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.677
IT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T FIT.

01:52.744 --> 01:54.379
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE AN OLD
ONEONTA SWEATSHIRT THAT MY-

01:54.446 --> 01:55.713
SORRY.

01:57.949 --> 02:00.284
THEY HAVE ASKED ME TO PICK
SOMEBODY TO FILL IN

02:00.353 --> 02:02.988
WHILE I'M ON VACATION,

02:03.055 --> 02:08.158
AND, WELL, SINCE YOU TWO
ARE THE SENIOR DRIVERS,

02:08.227 --> 02:11.863
WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU
WANTS IT, I DON'T CARE.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.532
I GOT TO GO WRITE MY NAME
IN ALL MY UNDERWEAR.

02:18.237 --> 02:21.506
SO, UH, HOW ARE WE
GONNA DECIDE THIS?

02:21.574 --> 02:24.425
HERE'S ONE WAY.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

02:24.493 --> 02:26.393
OK. GREAT. ALL RIGHT.

02:26.461 --> 02:28.462
BUT YOU KNOW I GOT TO TELL
KELLY ABOUT THIS,

02:28.530 --> 02:30.464
AND SHE'S GONNA
TELL CARRIE.

02:30.532 --> 02:33.351
OH, RIGHT. HER.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.203
I JUST KNOW HOW SHE'S ALWAYS
ON YOU TO MAKE MORE OF YOURSELF.

02:36.271 --> 02:39.157
YEAH. SHE'S STILL PUSHING
THAT ROCK UP THAT HILL.

02:40.726 --> 02:42.643
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO,
MAN. I'M MY OWN MAN, OK?

02:42.711 --> 02:43.311
I'M NOT TAKING
ORDERS FROM HER.

02:43.378 --> 02:44.795
I'LL DO WHAT I WANT.

02:44.863 --> 02:46.297
IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE
DOING IT, I AIN'T DOING IT.

02:46.365 --> 02:47.248
YOU SURE?

02:47.283 --> 02:48.917
ABSOLUTELY,
MR. SUPERVISOR.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.001
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A NAP NOW.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.203
DON'T BE A JERK
ABOUT THAT.

02:58.844 --> 03:01.362
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM
MR. KAUFMAN'S ASSISTANT.

03:01.430 --> 03:04.131
SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE ALL
THE SECRETARIES ARE HERE.

03:04.199 --> 03:04.849
REALLY? WHY?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.200
I THINK THEY'RE
GIVING US GIFTS

03:06.268 --> 03:08.670
FOR ALL THE HARD WORK WE
DID ON THE EAST SIDE PROJECT.

03:08.737 --> 03:09.754
OH, I WONDER WHAT.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.656
YOU KNOW, OVER AT
BADER AND NASH,

03:11.724 --> 03:14.526
THEY CLOSED A HUGE DEAL, AND
ALL THE ASSISTANTS GOT CARS.

03:14.594 --> 03:18.796
DAWN, WE'RE NOT GETTING
CARS, HONEY.

03:18.864 --> 03:23.735
ALTHOUGH THE PARTNERS DID MAKE, LIKE,
A KAJILLION DOLLARS ON THIS DEAL.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.970
ACTUALLY, DIDN'T MR.
KAUFMAN SAY IN THE MEMO

03:26.038 --> 03:29.523
THAT HE APPRECIATED
OUR DRIVE?

03:29.591 --> 03:31.375
YES, HE DID!
YEAH.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.978
OH, MY GOD. COULD YOU
IMAGINE IF WE GOT CARS?

03:34.046 --> 03:35.647
I WONDER IF WE GET
TO PICK THE COLOR.

03:35.714 --> 03:36.648
I'M FEELING
LIGHTHEADED NOW.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.818
OH, MY GOD. HEY.
WHAT'S THIS?

03:39.885 --> 03:43.587
JUST A THANK-YOU FROM MR.
KAUFMAN FOR EVERYONE'S HARD WORK.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.042
WHAT IS THIS? SOAP?

03:48.110 --> 03:50.762
AND LOTION.
MADE FROM MUSTARD SEEDS.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.296
CONGRATULATIONS!

03:55.051 --> 03:57.385
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SEEING
A LOT OF TISSUE PAPER HERE

03:57.452 --> 03:59.353
AND NOT A LOT
OF CAR KEYS.

03:59.421 --> 04:01.439
WHAT DID THIS COST HIM-LIKE, 10 BUCKS?

04:01.507 --> 04:05.727
I THINK THIS STUFF IS FROM
THAT HOTEL WE'RE TEARING DOWN.

04:05.794 --> 04:08.179
WHAT? THEY GOT IT
FOR FREE?

04:08.246 --> 04:11.282
I KIND OF LIKE IT. IT'LL FEEL
LIKE I'M STAYING IN A FANCY HOTEL

04:11.350 --> 04:13.685
RIGHT IN MY OWN
APARTMENT.

04:13.752 --> 04:14.852
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.187
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
GETTING NOTHING.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.272
THIS IS LIKE
A SLAP IN THE FACE.

04:18.339 --> 04:23.127
OH, LADIES. I SEE YOU
GOT YOUR GIFT BASKETS.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.278
GOT 'EM AND LOVE 'EM.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.706
HEY, BABY.

04:34.773 --> 04:36.507
WHAT SMELLS
LIKE MUSTARD?

04:36.575 --> 04:37.675
MY BONUS.

04:37.742 --> 04:40.311
QUICK THING. TODAY I
HAD A CHANCE TO BECOME

04:40.379 --> 04:41.679
A TEMPORARY
SUPERVISOR,

04:41.747 --> 04:44.482
BUT I TOLD DEACON
HE SHOULD TAKE IT.

04:47.235 --> 04:49.020
OK.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.908
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
COULD BE A PERMANENT THING,

04:53.976 --> 04:56.110
BUT I LIKE DRIVING,

04:56.178 --> 04:57.845
AND I AIN'T DOING IT.

05:00.715 --> 05:04.185
DOUG, LOOK, I KNOW ALL
YOU WANT TO BE IS A DRIVER.

05:04.252 --> 05:06.688
I'M OK WITH IT.

05:06.755 --> 05:10.257
OH, I GET WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

05:10.325 --> 05:11.676
A LITTLE REVERSE
PSYCHOLOGY THING.

05:11.743 --> 05:13.744
YOU SAY ALL I CAN BE
IS A DRIVER,

05:13.812 --> 05:17.798
AND I SAY, "OH,
I'LL SHOW HER."

05:17.866 --> 05:18.916
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:18.984 --> 05:20.518
IT DIDN'T WORK WHEN
ROGE TRIED IT ON RERUN,

05:20.586 --> 05:23.654
AND IT AIN'T GONNA
WORK ON ME.

05:23.722 --> 05:26.023
DOUG, A LITTLE STORY.
SIT. SIT.

05:28.393 --> 05:30.428
REMEMBER A COUPLE
OF MONTHS AGO I SENT YOU

05:30.496 --> 05:32.863
TO THAT INVESTMENT SEMINAR
IN THE CITY?

05:32.931 --> 05:33.932
YEAH.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.533
I WANTED YOU TO LEARN A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MANAGING MONEY

05:35.601 --> 05:37.952
INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.654
WHAT DID YOU COME
BACK WITH?

05:39.721 --> 05:41.172
SOME KITTENS.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.307
KITTENS.

05:42.374 --> 05:44.926
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.

05:44.994 --> 05:49.047
WHILE I WAS DRIVING AROUND
TRYING TO FIND THEM HOMES,

05:49.114 --> 05:50.515
I REALIZED,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:50.582 --> 05:54.252
NOTHING GOOD HAS EVER COME
FROM ME PUSHING YOU.

05:54.319 --> 05:58.689
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE,
AND I'M OK WITH IT.

05:58.757 --> 05:59.440
REALLY?

05:59.508 --> 06:02.776
YEAH. WERE THERE
SOME TEARS?

06:02.844 --> 06:03.961
SURE.

06:06.665 --> 06:08.633
DID I LOOK INTO A
ONE-WAY TICKET TO MIAMI?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.968
ABSOLUTELY.

06:11.036 --> 06:14.555
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I MADE MY
PEACE WITH IT, AND I'M OK WITH IT.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.611
I'LL SHOW HER.

06:25.684 --> 06:26.850
GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

06:26.918 --> 06:28.202
GOOD MORNING.

06:28.270 --> 06:30.455
QUESTION. ARE ANY OF
YOUR HUSBANDS MECHANICS?

06:30.522 --> 06:35.259
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE SEAT
WARMERS ON MY NEW BENTLEY.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.578
NO. SORRY.
SORRY. I CAN'T HELP YOU.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.314
WELL, SOMEONE GOT A NEW CAR.

06:40.382 --> 06:41.633
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'D LIKE TO DO?

06:41.700 --> 06:43.134
I'D LIKE TO GO OVER
THERE AND SAY,

06:43.201 --> 06:45.537
"YEAH, YOU KNOW WHY YOU HAVE
A HALF-MILLION-DOLLAR CAR?

06:45.604 --> 06:47.271
"BECAUSE OF US.

06:47.339 --> 06:48.622
"NOW YOU WANT YOUR
SEAT WARMED?

06:48.690 --> 06:52.043
WHY DON'T YOU SIT ON THOSE
CHEAP-ASS CANDLES YOU GAVE US?"

06:52.111 --> 06:53.194
UH, PARDON ME, LADIES.

06:53.262 --> 06:55.729
I NEVER GET
MY OWN COFFEE.

06:55.797 --> 06:57.898
WHICH ONE
IS THE DECAF?

06:57.966 --> 07:01.769
OH, IT'S THE ONE
ON THE RIGHT, SIR.

07:01.836 --> 07:04.372
YOU KNOW, SIR, MAYBE IF
YOU GOT YOUR OWN COFFEE

07:04.440 --> 07:06.841
ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU'D
KNOW WHICH WAS WHICH.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.447
EXCUSE ME?

07:13.515 --> 07:17.001
MAYBE YOU'D UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE GO THROUGH AROUND HERE.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.653
WE WORKED REALLY, REALLY
HARD ON THAT LAST PROJECT,

07:19.721 --> 07:21.389
AND WHAT DID WE GET?

07:21.456 --> 07:24.375
STINKY BASKETS.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.327
SO IF YOU WANT
YOUR SEAT WARMED,

07:26.395 --> 07:29.714
WHY DON'T YOU SIT ON THOSE
CHEAP-ASS CANDLES YOU GAVE US?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.985
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

07:34.053 --> 07:36.204
DAWN MORGAN.

07:36.272 --> 07:37.888
BYE, DAWN.

07:39.424 --> 07:44.062
WELL, MISS MORGAN,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.247
I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY
WITH THE NEW CAR

07:46.315 --> 07:47.699
AND GETTING THE
SUMMER HOUSE READY,

07:47.766 --> 07:49.200
I GUESS
I HAD FORGOTTEN

07:49.267 --> 07:52.003
THE PEOPLE WHO MADE
ALL THIS POSSIBLE.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.905
THANK YOU, DAWN, FOR
SPEAKING YOUR MIND.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.809
THAT TOOK MOXIE, AND THAT'S
EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING

07:57.877 --> 07:59.844
WE NEED AROUND HERE.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.714
YOU'RE GOING PLACES,
YOUNG LADY.

08:04.099 --> 08:05.666
CRAP.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.542
MORNING.

08:14.609 --> 08:15.709
HEY, MAN.

08:19.348 --> 08:21.032
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.583
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DECIDED I WANT TO BE

08:22.651 --> 08:24.418
FILL-IN SUPERVISOR
AFTER ALL.

08:24.486 --> 08:26.153
WHAT?

08:26.221 --> 08:27.121
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT CARRIE
SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT?

08:27.188 --> 08:30.457
SHE SAID SHE ACCEPTS
ME FOR WHO I AM.

08:30.525 --> 08:32.243
WELL, I'M SURE THAT
MUST HAVE HURT,

08:32.309 --> 08:33.745
BUT I'M ALL SET UP HERE.

08:33.812 --> 08:35.746
OH? WELL, HEY, MAYBE WE
COULD DO THE JOB TOGETHER.

08:35.813 --> 08:37.015
TWO HEADS ARE BETTER
THAN ONE, RIGHT?

08:37.082 --> 08:38.381
WELL,
THEORETICALLY, BUT-

08:38.450 --> 08:40.717
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT!

08:40.785 --> 08:43.520
WHOO! WHAT A RUSH.

08:43.589 --> 08:46.223
HA HA HA! YEP,
MAKING IT WORK.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.542
MAKING IT WORK.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.877
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?
SOME TIME CARDS?

08:49.945 --> 08:51.179
FLOAT ME SOME OF
THOSE BAD BOYS.

08:51.246 --> 08:53.747
GIVE ME SOME.
ALL RIGHT.

08:53.815 --> 08:56.084
I'LL WORK ON THAT.

08:56.151 --> 08:57.784
OK. OH, I JUST NEED
THIS THING HERE.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.653
SORRY. HERE WE GO.

09:13.401 --> 09:16.037
WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE
NUMBERS AIN'T ADDING UP?

09:16.104 --> 09:20.858
NO. DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
GOMEZ'S MIDDLE NAME WAS EUGENE?

09:22.327 --> 09:23.544
IT DOESN'T FIT.

09:23.612 --> 09:28.549
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? TIME CARDS
IS MORE OF A ONE-MAN JOB, SO...

09:28.617 --> 09:30.301
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

09:30.368 --> 09:35.673
UM, I'M SURE WE GOT SOMETHING AROUND
HERE THAT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.108
OK, NOW, THIS
IS ALL WRONG.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.209
WE NEED A SMOOTHER TRANSITION
FROM SALTY TO SWEET,

09:39.277 --> 09:40.728
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOSE THE RAISINS.

09:40.795 --> 09:43.514
IT'S JUST MAKING
THE GUYS ANGRY.

09:43.581 --> 09:45.350
THIS IS THE STUFF
THEY ALWAYS ORDER.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.685
OK, HEY. NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN, ALL RIGHT?

09:47.752 --> 09:50.554
NOW, WHO DO I TALK TO
ABOUT A CARVING STATION?

09:52.307 --> 09:53.824
EVERYTHING'S
LOOKING GOOD.

09:53.892 --> 09:55.526
I SYNCHRONIZED
ALL THE CLOCKS

09:55.594 --> 09:57.662
AND I SPOKE TO
THE JANITOR.

09:57.729 --> 10:00.164
FIRST THING MONDAY,
NEW URINAL CAKES.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.233
GOOD WORK.

10:03.301 --> 10:05.436
YEAH?
OH, HEY, WALLY.

10:05.503 --> 10:06.687
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE
LATE DELIVERIES THIS MORNING.

10:06.755 --> 10:08.589
THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED.

10:08.656 --> 10:09.840
IT'S OK.
JUST REMEMBER, NEXT TIME,

10:09.908 --> 10:12.343
RADIO IN, AND WE'LL GIVE
YOU AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.227
WILL DO, SIR.

10:13.295 --> 10:14.512
AND THANKS FOR BEING
COOL ABOUT IT.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.430
NOT A PROBLEM.
AND LISTEN, CALL ME DEACON.

10:16.497 --> 10:17.498
SURE.

10:17.565 --> 10:19.199
HEY, I'M COOL WITH IT,
TOO.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.201
UH-HUH.

10:21.269 --> 10:22.319
CALL ME DOUG.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.755
HEY, UH,

10:24.823 --> 10:26.924
THEY KNOW I'M SUPERVISOR, TOO, RIGHT?

10:26.992 --> 10:30.511
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

10:31.196 --> 10:34.181
EXCUSE ME.
PALMER HERE.

10:34.249 --> 10:37.451
NO, NO. THEY HAVE
TO BE OUT BY 3:00.

10:37.518 --> 10:38.886
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
JUST START LOADING THEM UP.

10:38.954 --> 10:39.887
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

10:39.955 --> 10:40.888
GOT TROUBLE ON
THE LOADING DOCK?

10:40.956 --> 10:41.923
YOU WANT ME
TO GET INTO IT?

10:41.990 --> 10:45.392
NAH. I GOT IT.
JUST DON'T...

10:51.216 --> 10:52.216
OH, DEAC'S NOT HERE?

10:52.283 --> 10:53.818
I'LL COME BACK.

10:53.885 --> 10:55.269
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

10:56.571 --> 10:58.222
I'M SUPERVISOR, TOO.
WHAT'S UP?

10:58.289 --> 11:00.007
I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR MY ROUTE ASSIGNMENT.

11:00.074 --> 11:01.392
OH, RIGHT...
NO PROBLEM.

11:02.928 --> 11:06.330
THERE YOU ARE.
YOU'RE GOING TO JERSEY.

11:07.766 --> 11:08.832
JERSEY?

11:08.900 --> 11:09.934
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
NEW JERSEY.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.769
I DON'T USUALLY DO
RUNS OUT OF STATE.

11:11.836 --> 11:13.470
OH, YOU DON'T USUALLY DO
RUNS OUT OF STATE?

11:14.973 --> 11:17.374
YOU'RE GOING TO JERSEY.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.178
WOW.
YEAH, WOW.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.115
SO YOU'RE REALLY MOVING
TO THE 19th FLOOR?

11:24.183 --> 11:27.919
YEAH. AND ALL BECAUSE
I BLEW UP AT MR. KAUFMAN.

11:27.986 --> 11:30.588
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
ALL THAT STUFF CAME FROM.

11:30.655 --> 11:32.890
I THINK I DO.

11:32.958 --> 11:37.879
ANYWAY, THEY'RE HAVING A PIZZA PARTY
FOR ME UPSTAIRS, SO... GOTTA SCOOT.

11:37.946 --> 11:40.647
I'M REALLY, REALLY
GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.

11:40.715 --> 11:43.834
AW, AREN'T YOU
JUST MADE OF SUGAR.

11:43.902 --> 11:44.985
HERE,
LET ME HELP YOU.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.189
UH, MR. KAUFMAN.

11:49.257 --> 11:51.091
YES, CARRIE.

11:51.159 --> 11:53.461
LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT PROJECT,

11:53.529 --> 11:56.430
AND ALL WE GOT WAS
SOME STUPID GIFT BASKETS.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.832
SO IF YOU WANT
YOUR SEATS WARMED,

11:58.900 --> 12:02.503
WHY DON'T YOU SIT ON THOSE
CHEAP-ASS CANDLES YOU GAVE US.

12:02.571 --> 12:05.373
YEAH.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.059
YOU'RE JUST REPEATING WHAT
DAWN SAID THIS MORNING.

12:09.127 --> 12:11.963
DAWN TALKED TO YOU?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.280
I BELIEVE YOU WERE
RIGHT THERE.

12:13.348 --> 12:14.698
OH, NO, THAT WASN'T ME.

12:14.766 --> 12:17.168
YOU KNOW, ALL US
WHITE GIRLS LOOK ALIKE.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.603
HA HA!

12:19.671 --> 12:21.238
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:21.306 --> 12:23.524
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ALL THAT
STUFF THAT DAWN SAID TO YOU

12:23.592 --> 12:25.426
CAME FROM ME.

12:25.493 --> 12:26.560
WHAT?

12:26.628 --> 12:27.611
I SAID IT FIRST.

12:27.679 --> 12:29.480
ALL RIGHT, BEHIND YOUR BACK,
BUT IT WAS ALL ME.

12:29.547 --> 12:31.615
NOT HER, ME.

12:31.683 --> 12:32.833
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
CARRIE,

12:32.901 --> 12:35.002
BUT SHE'S THE ONE
WHO HAD THE MOXIE

12:35.070 --> 12:36.403
TO SAY IT
TO MY FACE.

12:36.471 --> 12:37.855
BUT IT WAS MY MOXIE.

12:37.922 --> 12:40.724
SHE STOLE MY MOXIE.

12:40.792 --> 12:44.445
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE A LONG
DRIVE TO THE ISLAND, SO...

12:44.513 --> 12:46.296
LOOK, MR. KAUFMAN,
I REALLY DO HAVE MOXIE.

12:46.364 --> 12:48.165
OK, LOOK, I CAN SAY STUFF TO YOUR FACE.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.369
YOU'RE BALD.

12:51.436 --> 12:53.137
TRY FAT AND BALD.

12:53.205 --> 12:55.506
MMM-HMM. AND YOU KNOW
WHAT? I STEAL STUFF.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.508
NOT LITTLE THINGS
LIKE PENS-

12:57.575 --> 12:59.743
BIG STUFF.

12:59.811 --> 13:02.846
MOXIE?

13:02.914 --> 13:05.766
CARRIE, STEALING IS
A FIREABLE OFFENSE.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.117
THE KIND OF
FIREABLE OFFENSE

13:07.185 --> 13:08.919
YOU'VE BEEN NEEDING
AROUND HERE?

13:14.526 --> 13:15.909
AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE.

13:15.977 --> 13:18.095
YOU'LL GET YOUR SHIPMENT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.530
OK.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.298
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ROUTE ASSIGNMENTS FOR?

13:21.366 --> 13:24.618
JUST PUTTING THE CO IN
CO-SUPERVISOR. WHY? WHAT'S UP?

13:24.686 --> 13:28.822
YOU SENT OUT 4 PARTS OF A TV
STAND IN 4 DIFFERENT TRUCKS.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.824
WELL, THE PRESIDENT
AND THE VICE PRESIDENT

13:30.892 --> 13:33.059
NEVER TRAVEL IN THE SAME
PLANE TOGETHER, SO...

13:33.127 --> 13:34.561
NEXT QUESTION.

13:34.629 --> 13:37.764
OK, HOW ABOUT EXPLAINING WHY
NOBODY NORTH OF HILLSIDE AVENUE

13:37.832 --> 13:39.333
GOT THEIR
PACKAGES TODAY?

13:39.401 --> 13:40.567
ALL RIGHT,
NEGATIVE NELLIE,

13:40.635 --> 13:42.436
WHAT ABOUT SOUTH
OF HILLSIDE?

13:42.504 --> 13:44.771
OH, THEY GOT PACKAGES,
JUST THE WRONG ONES.

13:44.839 --> 13:46.224
I TELL YOU,
THIS CO-SUPERVISOR THING

13:46.291 --> 13:47.558
JUST AIN'T WORKING OUT
FOR ME.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.010
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

13:49.077 --> 13:51.228
I'M SAYING YOU SUCK
AND I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

13:51.295 --> 13:52.396
OK, WELL, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE,

13:52.464 --> 13:53.397
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW I THINK
OF IT, YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.831
YOU GO, GO.

13:54.899 --> 13:57.234
ALL RIGHT, FINE, WE GOT TO FIGURE
OUT SOME WAY TO SETTLE THIS.

13:57.302 --> 13:58.402
FINE.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.587
LET'S HAVE
A STARING CONTEST.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.842
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
OUR CAREERS.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.877
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
THIS WHOLE THING DECIDED-

14:06.945 --> 14:08.362
YOU BLINKED!
YOU BLINKED! I WON!

14:08.430 --> 14:09.497
GET OUT.

14:09.564 --> 14:11.015
THERE WAS
NO STARING CONTEST.

14:11.082 --> 14:12.082
THERE ABSOLUTELY WAS.

14:12.150 --> 14:13.651
I SUGGESTED IT. YOU
LOCKED IN. IT WAS ON.

14:13.718 --> 14:15.436
NOT A PERSON IN THE WORLD
WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME.

14:15.503 --> 14:16.153
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:16.305 --> 14:17.571
YOU'RE SUPERVISOR.
HAVE FUN WITH IT.

14:17.589 --> 14:18.855
GREAT.
I WILL BE.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.224
THANKS FOR BEING A PART OF
THE TEAM. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.358
MORON.

14:21.426 --> 14:22.660
CALL ME DOUG.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.031
YO.

14:28.099 --> 14:29.900
HEY, IT'S DANNY.

14:29.968 --> 14:33.153
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE ROUTE YOU GAVE ME.

14:33.188 --> 14:36.823
YOU TAKE 95 SOUTH
TO ROUTE 27.

14:36.891 --> 14:39.076
I DON'T THINK I CAN GO
ANY FURTHER, YOU KNOW?

14:39.144 --> 14:40.727
IT LOOKS
A LITTLE DANGEROUS.

14:40.795 --> 14:43.830
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST TURN
AROUND AND START HEADING BACK.

14:43.898 --> 14:46.850
WHOA, WHOA. GUY,
YOU'RE AN I.P.S. DRIVER.

14:46.918 --> 14:49.686
SOMETIMES THAT MEANS PUTTING
YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE.

14:49.705 --> 14:51.372
I DON'T THINK IT DOES.

14:51.439 --> 14:53.673
LOOK, NOW IS A BAD TIME
FOR YOU TO COME BACK HERE

14:53.741 --> 14:55.575
AND EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF DEACON,

14:55.643 --> 14:57.344
SO JUST DRIVE, DAMMIT.

14:57.379 --> 14:58.462
FINE!

15:12.144 --> 15:14.144
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO SAID IT FIRST,

15:14.212 --> 15:15.812
SO I DESERVE THE OFFICE.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.147
I MEAN,
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT,

15:17.215 --> 15:20.351
THEN YOU'RE JUST
A FREAKING IDIOT.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.585
HEY.

15:21.652 --> 15:22.752
CALL YOUR MOM.

15:22.820 --> 15:26.707
OK. SO, DID YOU, UH,

15:26.775 --> 15:28.325
YOU EVER DONE IT WITH
A SUPERVISOR BEFORE?

15:28.393 --> 15:30.027
HMM?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.745
WHEN I WORKED
AT SHOE TOWN.

15:31.812 --> 15:34.281
AND BEVERAGE BARN.
AND THEN-

15:34.349 --> 15:35.816
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS
JUST TRYING TO BE CUTE.

15:35.884 --> 15:37.985
WASN'T LOOKING FOR
AN ACTUAL ANSWER.

15:38.053 --> 15:41.372
BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT
THE NEW I.P.S. SUPERVISOR.

15:41.439 --> 15:44.208
AND ALL YOU THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA BE WAS A DRIVER, RIGHT?

15:44.275 --> 15:46.810
THAT'S GOTTA STING.

15:46.878 --> 15:50.297
ACTUALLY, IT DOESN'T. IT
COULDN'T COME AT A BETTER TIME

15:50.365 --> 15:52.165
BECAUSE I MOUTHED OFF
TO MY BOSS TODAY

15:52.233 --> 15:54.234
AND I THINK I MIGHT
LOSE MY JOB.

15:54.302 --> 15:55.803
WHAT?

15:55.870 --> 15:58.556
I MIGHT LOSE MY JOB.
WHAT?

15:58.623 --> 16:00.741
YEAH, I SENT ALL THE DRIVERS
OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,

16:00.809 --> 16:02.910
AND I LEFT MY LOG BOOK
AT A DENNY'S,

16:02.978 --> 16:05.112
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHICH DENNY'S. I'M SO FIRED.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.297
NO, BABY, COME ON,
IT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY.

16:07.365 --> 16:08.799
YOU'LL GET BETTER.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.450
REALLY THINK SO?

16:10.518 --> 16:13.103
NO.

16:13.171 --> 16:15.355
YOU'RE SUCH
AN IDIOT.

16:15.423 --> 16:16.673
YOU SCREWED UP
AT WORK, TOO!

16:16.741 --> 16:17.991
NOT AS BAD AS YOU.

16:18.059 --> 16:19.960
SO, THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR SHOE TOWN SUPERVISOR.

16:20.027 --> 16:21.228
AH, HE'S GAY NOW.

16:21.296 --> 16:22.563
YEAH, GEE,
I WONDER WHY.

16:22.631 --> 16:23.964
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

16:24.031 --> 16:27.534
NOW, LET'S NOT TURN ON EACH
OTHER JUST YET HERE, OK?

16:27.602 --> 16:28.868
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

16:28.936 --> 16:30.654
ALL RIGHT,
NOW LET ME THINK HERE.

16:30.722 --> 16:33.707
NOW, HOW MUCH DOES
MANAGEMENT UPSTAIRS KNOW?

16:33.775 --> 16:34.624
I DON'T THINK
VERY MUCH AT ALL

16:34.776 --> 16:36.042
'CAUSE I DON'T RETURN
THEIR CALLS.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.244
OK, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.

16:37.312 --> 16:38.479
SO HERE'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

16:38.546 --> 16:39.679
FIRST THING
TOMORROW,

16:39.747 --> 16:42.216
YOU'RE GONNA CONVINCE
DEACON TO BE SUPERVISOR.

16:42.283 --> 16:44.084
AND BY THE TIME
THEY REALIZE

16:44.152 --> 16:45.919
HOW SCREWED UP
EVERYTHING IS,

16:45.987 --> 16:48.355
DEACON WILL BE THERE
TO TAKE THE FALL.

16:48.423 --> 16:50.057
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
DEACON WILL GET FIRED.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.775
NAH, THEY WON'T FIRE
HIM. HE'S A MINORITY.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.112
ALL RIGHT,
AND AS FOR ME,

16:55.180 --> 16:59.183
I GOTTA DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO KEEP MY JOB.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.818
AND I DO MEAN
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

17:01.886 --> 17:04.954
YOU OK WITH THAT?

17:05.021 --> 17:07.925
I ASSUMED YOU'D BEEN DOING
THAT ALL ALONG, SO YEAH.

17:11.847 --> 17:15.348
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, SUPERVISOR?

17:15.415 --> 17:16.367
YEAH, DEKE, LISTEN,

17:16.518 --> 17:19.286
I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AND, UH, YOU'RE THE GUY

17:19.354 --> 17:21.589
WHO DESERVES TO BE
SITTING BACK HERE.

17:21.656 --> 17:22.756
OH, YEAH?

17:22.824 --> 17:25.509
YOU WON
THE STARING CONTEST.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.779
THE TRUTH IS
I BLINKED FIRST.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.615
BUT YOU COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE
I HAVE VERY FAST BLINKING.

17:31.682 --> 17:34.184
I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU SEE?

17:34.252 --> 17:35.285
NO, 'CAUSE IT'S THAT FAST.

17:35.353 --> 17:36.870
ANYWAY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:36.938 --> 17:38.806
YOU GOT AN ANGRY CALL
ON LINE 3.

17:38.873 --> 17:40.473
YOU THINK
I'M THAT STUPID?

17:40.541 --> 17:42.242
ALL RIGHT, IT WAS
ALL CARRIE'S IDEA.

17:42.309 --> 17:44.878
WELL, YOU CAN TELL HER I'M NOT
GONNA GET FIRED FOR YOUR SCREW-UP.

17:44.945 --> 17:46.597
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET FIRED.
YOU'RE A MINORITY.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.799
WHAT?

17:48.866 --> 17:50.133
ALSO CARRIE.
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.068
OH...

17:52.620 --> 17:53.437
HEY, WALLACH!

17:53.505 --> 17:54.771
YES, SIR?

17:54.839 --> 17:55.989
LISTEN, GUY,
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU

17:56.057 --> 17:57.724
SINCE YOU STARTED
ON MONDAY.

17:57.792 --> 17:59.826
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU GOT THE RIGHT STUFF.

17:59.894 --> 18:01.895
I GOT A LITTLE PROPOSAL
FOR YOU.

18:01.962 --> 18:02.612
I'M NOT TAKING
YOUR JOB.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.981
FINE!
SEND DANNY IN!

18:04.048 --> 18:04.731
DANNY'S NOT HERE.

18:04.799 --> 18:06.083
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM
SINCE YESTERDAY.

18:15.726 --> 18:17.894
BOBBY!

18:22.300 --> 18:24.334
MR. KAUFMAN.

18:26.471 --> 18:30.824
LISTEN, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR EVERYTHING I SAID.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.360
MY HUSBAND'S HAVING
BLADDER PROBLEMS.

18:35.663 --> 18:37.515
ANYWAY, I JUST
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

18:37.582 --> 18:39.182
THAT I'M VERY HAPPY HERE

18:39.250 --> 18:43.888
AND I HOPE YOU ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE
TO BE AN ASSET TO THIS COMPANY.

18:43.955 --> 18:48.759
YOU KNOW, CARRIE, I WAS QUITE PUT
OFF WITH YOUR BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY,

18:48.827 --> 18:53.363
BUT THEN I STARTED TO THINK,
THAT ACTUALLY TOOK MOXIE.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.665
REALLY?

18:55.733 --> 18:58.669
BUT THIS PATHETIC DISPLAY
OF INSINCERE GROVELING

18:58.737 --> 19:01.271
PROVES TO ME I WAS WRONG.

19:01.339 --> 19:03.757
YOU DON'T HAVE
A TRACE OF MOXIE.

19:19.874 --> 19:23.394
SO... ANYWAYS, MY FATHER IS
LYING SPRAWLED OUT ON THE FLOOR

19:23.461 --> 19:25.462
IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.281
AND I SAYS,
"ARE YOU OK, DAD?"

19:27.349 --> 19:29.416
HE SAYS, "YEAH,
BUT I'M NOT YOUR-"

19:32.687 --> 19:34.254
IT'S OPEN.

19:34.322 --> 19:36.423
THIS A GOOD TIME?

19:38.659 --> 19:40.560
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:40.628 --> 19:42.595
I JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP
WITH THE SUPERVISOR THING.

19:42.663 --> 19:44.597
WAIT.
YOU'RE SUPERVISOR?

19:44.665 --> 19:47.300
YOU SAID EITHER ME
OR PALMER COULD DO IT.

19:47.368 --> 19:49.986
I DID? I MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF IT.

19:50.054 --> 19:51.205
I GUESS SO.
YIKES.

19:51.272 --> 19:53.273
ANYWAY, YOU WANT
