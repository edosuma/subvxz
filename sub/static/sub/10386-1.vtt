WEBVTT

01:47.140 --> 01:48.471
Take five.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.329
Special order.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.039
Hello.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.778
Good night, sir.

08:50.863 --> 08:51.989
Jake.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.839
Go cool it, baby.

09:17.490 --> 09:21.551
That broad, she could write a dirty book
and make it a bestseller in two weeks.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.561
Jimmy, give us some drinks here.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.325
How you been, Nick?
Been looking all over town for you.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.196
Okay. How about yourself, Jake?

09:28.267 --> 09:32.363
I got some trouble.
Big trouble in Kansas City with Mary Ann.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.768
He's getting fat as a water rat.

09:34.841 --> 09:38.038
He owes us a lot, Nick.
Close to a half a million.

09:38.344 --> 09:41.802
He's skimming his own cream
and sticking Kansas right up my ass.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.974
I need you to straighten him out.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.276
So what's the tab?

09:45.351 --> 09:46.613
$50,000.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.015
Any way it cuts.

09:52.024 --> 09:54.720
- Any way?
- Any way.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.951
Go get yourself a bagman.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.497
No, Nick, it's bigger than that.
I need you.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.261
Well, Jake, I'm kind of taking my ease.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.301
Why don't you use your own boys?

10:06.072 --> 10:07.505
I did, Nick.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.436
I sent Kelly down there.
I sent Maguire down to look for him.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.036
He found him in 10 feet of cowflop.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.506
They found Maguire
floating down the Missouri.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.612
And then I sent down Murphy.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.255
Shaughnessy, bring that over here.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.351
Take a look at that, Nick.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.459
Go ahead, take a look.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.482
Brings back bad memories, Nick.
Weenie and Mary Ann.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.880
The pigsfoot brothers.
They knocked down on everyone.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.857
And we knew them when.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.270
I'll need some boys.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.566
Delaney.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.735
O'Brien.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.169
Shaughnessy here.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.943
They're good men, Nick.
They're young, but they're good...

11:22.014 --> 11:24.847
and what's going on in this town,
the best I got.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.725
Okay, they'll do fine.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.062
Attaboy, Nick. See you around.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.003
You'd better watch out.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.273
You might have yourself
another Clarabelle.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.838
I never did have any taste, Nick.

11:55.915 --> 12:00.011
When you get to Kansas City,
don't say hello to Clarabelle for me.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.985
What should I do with these, Mr. Devlin?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.186
- Did you know Murphy?
- Yeah.

12:09.261 --> 12:12.025
- Was he a good guy?
- Yeah, he was a good guy.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.622
Then bury him.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.199
<i>Report for Chicago remains unchanged.</i>

12:21.273 --> 12:23.264
<i>The heat wave continues
into the fifth day...</i>

12:23.342 --> 12:25.674
<i>with temperatures in the mid 90s
and high humidity.</i>

12:25.745 --> 12:28.043
<i>All parts of the Midwest
are similarly affected...</i>

12:28.114 --> 12:31.208
<i>and no relief is expected
for at least the next four to six days.</i>

12:31.283 --> 12:34.446
<i>Meanwhile, conditions in the East
from Washington to New England...</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:37.887
<i>are relatively cool,
with highs reaching the mid 80s.</i>

12:39.425 --> 12:42.087
<i>That's news and weather for now,
more of the same at 9:00.</i>

12:42.161 --> 12:43.856
<i>Now, back to Walter.</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:49.798
A whiff of the old times, eh, Nick?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.834
- I'll take it, kid.
- Thanks.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.514
Jump in, kid.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.277
Would you meet my mother, Mr. Devlin?

13:10.189 --> 13:11.713
Sure.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.984
He's coming to meet you, Mom.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.585
Oh, look, it's Mr. Devlin.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.424
Nick says he wants to meet you, Mom.

13:24.036 --> 13:28.097
- It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- The same, I'm sure, Mr. Devlin.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.039
- How do you do?
- Hello.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.341
Mom, I never saw anyone do that.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.177
Jump in.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.553
Corned beef and cabbage, eh, kid?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.089
- Coffee, Nick?
- Yeah, okay.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.964
I've never been to KC.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.105
- It's all farmland, huh?
- Yeah.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.239
- What do they grow there?
- Wheat, corn.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.735
Jesus, what a bare-ass town.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.690
Hang a left here.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.563
Stay put.

18:09.388 --> 18:13.518
<i>One, three. One, four.</i>

18:13.993 --> 18:18.362
<i>One, five. One, six.</i>

18:18.731 --> 18:22.861
<i>One, seven. One, eight.</i>

18:23.402 --> 18:25.563
<i>One, nine.</i>

18:26.572 --> 18:30.269
- What the....
- Nice to see you're in the same old rat hole.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.407
I didn't expect to see you here, Nick.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.816
You want some, Nick? It's kosher kiel.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.933
Too bad, Weenie. That's your hot dog hand.

18:57.002 --> 19:00.529
You tell Mary Ann that I'm here,
and not to get any fancy ideas...

19:00.606 --> 19:02.870
about turning me or any of my boys
into hamburger.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.431
You got it?

19:07.679 --> 19:09.044
Not hamburger.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.106
Irish stew! Then grease!

21:13.172 --> 21:14.469
Nice day.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.178
We're all closed down.
It's a private sale.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.519
Country hospitality. Shit!

22:51.236 --> 22:53.864
No, absolutely. She's great.

23:18.196 --> 23:22.462
This guy says to the girl:
"That's not my ring, that's my wristwatch."

23:29.308 --> 23:30.400
Nick.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.139
Mary Ann.

23:33.378 --> 23:36.211
- You're a sight for the old eyes.
- You, too.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.909
How's life been treating you?
I heard you're back East.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.212
Chicago.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.180
Chicago?

23:44.589 --> 23:48.525
- You know some of the guys, don't you?
- Yeah, I know some of the guys.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.805
- You eat guts?
- Yeah.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.110
I like them.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.544
Talk now, eat later.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.487
- You micks...
- Yeah, we got bad tempers.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.566
George, slice up some more
meat there, will you?

24:33.772 --> 24:35.933
Give them anything they want.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.904
Dig in, guys.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.001
Come on, dig in, will you?

24:40.379 --> 24:43.109
American beef is better. Eat more meat.

24:43.882 --> 24:47.579
I gotta talk some business here
with my friend Nick from Chicago.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.858
Pretty fancy place you got here.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.828
I thought you and Weenie
were in the meatpacking business.

24:59.898 --> 25:03.766
Well, cow flesh, girl flesh.
It's all the same to me.

25:04.469 --> 25:06.869
What they're buying, I'm selling.

25:07.305 --> 25:08.636
What do you want, Nick?

25:08.707 --> 25:11.141
The $500,000 you stiffed Chicago.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.501
Nobody liked the hot dogs, Mary Ann.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.607
- Maybe Jake'll like steak next time.
- Don't push.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.943
Come on, Nick, smarten up.

25:21.286 --> 25:22.810
Chicago's crumbling.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.914
There's nothing left there anymore
but kids and old men.

25:25.991 --> 25:29.757
What hasn't been burned down
has been shot out, picked over.

25:29.961 --> 25:32.691
If it still moves, it's stuck in Joliet.

25:33.465 --> 25:37.299
The East, who's running it?
Black boys? Puerto Ricans?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.234
They got their own way of doing things.

25:39.304 --> 25:42.239
- You talk their spic talk?
- <i>SÃ­.</i>

25:43.375 --> 25:46.572
What do they got anybody wants,
rats and garbage?

25:46.645 --> 25:48.670
You know what Chicago is?

25:48.947 --> 25:52.906
Chicago is a sick old sow,
grunting for fresh cream.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.709
What it deserves is slop.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.953
Someday, they're gonna
boil that town down for fat.

26:00.959 --> 26:03.689
Here, it's different.
This is the heartland.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.890
Everybody wants what I got. Grade A.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.794
Prime stuff, raised special.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.999
Of course, we gotta keep them
a little doped up.

26:16.374 --> 26:19.707
Uppers, downers,
all the livestock gets their shots.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.011
Help me, please.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.676
Why don't you come in with me, Nick?
It's good business.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.587
No. You wallow in your own sewer.
Just get it up for Chicago.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.423
It's the weekend, you know.
The banks are closed.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.794
Banks get opened.
Easy or hard, they get opened.

26:41.132 --> 26:44.693
You be at the fair tomorrow.
I'll give you what you want.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.531
How much is girl flesh to go these days?

26:48.607 --> 26:51.667
Well, the Blue Book is $20,
but for you it be $15.

26:51.743 --> 26:53.938
Let's just say I'm taking her on account.

26:55.847 --> 26:59.078
Yeah, real smart.
You and Jake, you think you're big men.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.142
Walk in anywhere, you take down
your pants and I'll take down mine.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.017
We'll see who's the biggest man.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.523
Why don't we just ask Clarabelle?

27:11.863 --> 27:13.854
How's the thumb, Weenie?

27:14.266 --> 27:18.259
If it still hurts, why don't you
stick it in your mouth and suck?

27:50.769 --> 27:53.738
Here, take care of things for me,
would you, please?

28:03.648 --> 28:05.548
- Nicholas Devlin.
- Nick.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.050
- Hello, Jerry. How are you?
- Good to see you, Nick.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.849
- Have your reservations all ready.
- Good.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.051
Show Mr. Devlin the Chicago Suite.

28:16.127 --> 28:20.291
They used to call it the Presidential Suite,
but they don't stop in Kansas anymore.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.061
Anything you need Nick, just ask.
You look fine.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.034
You look good, too, pal.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.934
- I'll take her.
- She's light as a baby.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.436
Shay, she'll need some things.

28:35.513 --> 28:38.380
Send somebody up
from the dress department.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.857
All right, who deals?

29:07.312 --> 29:09.280
All right, I put my ante in.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.314
This is gonna cost you, fellas.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.289
I open.

29:30.568 --> 29:31.899
Hello, kid.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.096
Hi.

29:42.013 --> 29:44.311
I never saw anything so pretty.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.679
It smells good.

29:51.756 --> 29:53.314
I go the limit.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.017
Straight Havana.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.453
I've got a good nose.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.794
- Smell a friend from a mile away, huh?
- You bet.

30:04.669 --> 30:08.230
- What's your name?
- Nick. What's yours?

30:08.339 --> 30:10.500
- Poppy.
- Hello, Poppy.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.539
Am I your present?

30:20.018 --> 30:21.076
No.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.216
Protective custody.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.787
Well, I guess that's not so bad.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.138
Is this one okay?

31:43.668 --> 31:45.568
There. Am I all right?

31:45.870 --> 31:47.235
Just fine.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.605
- Two, sir?
- Two, please.

32:56.107 --> 32:59.599
- Would you prefer the dinner, sir?
- Yes, we'll have the dinner.

32:59.677 --> 33:02.942
I believe the young lady
would like the consommÃ©...

33:03.281 --> 33:05.511
and I'll have the vichyssoise.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.914
Connie, white Jersey, $2,500.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.481
We're gonna have the best fair ever.

34:48.553 --> 34:51.147
Yep, we got the best damn fair ever.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.347
Let me see that.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.150
I'll get some liniment for that.

35:03.568 --> 35:04.899
Shorthorn.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.132
- It ain't gonna sting, is it?
- No.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.973
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35:24.722 --> 35:27.247
- That's gonna heal just fine.
- Yeah.

35:28.526 --> 35:30.551
See? It didn't hurt a bit.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.992
- Not you, you old wart.
- You old cheese.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.498
Goddamn old weevil, you!

35:35.566 --> 35:39.366
- You old sow belly!
- You goddamn cowgut!

35:51.215 --> 35:52.341
Okay.

35:56.454 --> 35:59.355
I sure am glad
you're my brother, Mary Ann.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.290
Black Angus....

36:09.367 --> 36:10.800
- Say you'll spit!
- I won't!

36:10.868 --> 36:11.857
Say it!

36:11.936 --> 36:14.905
Minneapolis. Frieda, Guernsey....

36:21.512 --> 36:24.072
- You turd-head!
- You old skinny shit!

36:26.517 --> 36:28.007
Glorybelle....

36:29.087 --> 36:30.384
Hereford.

36:30.455 --> 36:33.754
- How do you like our country ways?
- I've seen worse.

36:34.392 --> 36:37.452
I think I got myself
a smart-ass city slicker.

36:39.497 --> 36:42.022
Uncut fresh coke, $85,000.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.193
Mary Ann, you're a son of a bitch.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.828
White Jersey, $2,000.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.198
Yeah?

36:52.243 --> 36:54.711
Poppy, white Jersey, on account.

36:55.113 --> 36:57.445
On account? On account of what?

36:58.349 --> 37:01.147
On account of Chicago, you little sheeny.

37:01.319 --> 37:04.152
Chicago, Jezebel, Hereford....

37:08.226 --> 37:12.754
<i>For 100 years, men have slaughtered
these magnificent animals.</i>

37:13.064 --> 37:17.000
<i>Ironically, the largest mammals
that walk the earth....</i>

37:17.068 --> 37:18.558
You going out?

37:18.803 --> 37:20.998
You tore my shirt, you dummy.

37:21.139 --> 37:22.504
I'm sorry.

37:23.107 --> 37:26.372
Yeah, I'm going to that
Chamber of Commerce soirÃ©e.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.845
I'll pick up Clarabelle down at the boat.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.747
Do you suppose Clarabelle's
got an old dress she don't need?

37:34.819 --> 37:35.911
What?

37:36.988 --> 37:40.116
- I sort of wanna borrow a dress.
- What are you talking about?

37:40.191 --> 37:42.853
She's got a lot of dresses up there
and I'd just like to...

37:42.927 --> 37:44.827
Her dresses don't fit you.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.830
- Mary Ann.
- Yeah, go on.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.597
She buys enough to stuff a silo.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.265
Don't bust a gut.

37:56.274 --> 38:00.005
I never knew a man before,
not even to talk to.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.211
Well, where did they keep you?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.909
In the orphanage with the other girls.

38:07.752 --> 38:08.912
And where was that?

38:08.986 --> 38:12.387
It was in Missouri.
It's the only home I really remember.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.321
It was in the country.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.056
Then you have nobody?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.493
Just Violet.

38:18.563 --> 38:19.587
Who?

38:19.664 --> 38:23.259
Violet. The other girl that was with me.
She's my sister.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.267
Well, not truly,
but we're closer than that.

38:28.206 --> 38:31.175
Violet and me,
we'd climb into each other's bed...

38:31.242 --> 38:35.474
when it was really cold in the wintertime,
and hug each other really close.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.447
Sometimes, we'd touch each other...

38:38.516 --> 38:41.349
and dream how men's hands
would feel on us.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.757
I'd talk to her in a really deep voice
and I'd say, "I love you, Violet."

38:47.491 --> 38:50.085
And I'd kiss her so she wouldn't cry.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.290
We tried to run away once.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.696
But the old woman caught us.

39:01.472 --> 39:05.465
She said we couldn't leave,
that we were being raised up special.

39:05.610 --> 39:10.343
But that when we were done, there'd be
lots of handsome men loving us forever.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.110
You didn't really believe that, did you?

39:16.187 --> 39:20.851
No. You could tell they were lying,
but it didn't matter much...

39:20.925 --> 39:23.723
'cause in the spring,
we'd run out into the fields...

39:23.794 --> 39:26.592
and there'd be sunshine and new rain...

39:26.664 --> 39:30.498
and I'd be a squirrel, and a rabbit,
and a badger...

39:30.568 --> 39:33.264
and then I'd fall down
and feel the earth...

39:33.337 --> 39:37.330
and in an instant, I'd know that being alive
was just everything.

39:38.476 --> 39:39.875
I like that.

39:40.411 --> 39:41.901
Do you truly?

39:43.147 --> 39:44.580
Truly.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.650
Say my name.

39:48.719 --> 39:49.879
Poppy.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.789
Say it again.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.477
Violet?

41:41.532 --> 41:43.659
Violet's a real pretty name.

41:52.943 --> 41:54.274
Put it on.

42:19.503 --> 42:22.836
You're beautiful, Violet. Yeah, you are.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.477
You're as beautiful
as anybody I ever seen.

42:28.612 --> 42:30.512
If you do real good...

42:32.082 --> 42:34.107
I'll take you to the fair.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.052
Yeah, I will.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.981
Jayhawker Fair souvenirs.
Who's gonna have one?

43:15.226 --> 43:17.751
<i>...will be declared ineligible
to be shown to judges.</i>

43:17.828 --> 43:21.355
<i>Those entering in the wrong categories
will be disqualified....</i>

44:26.630 --> 44:29.190
- ...here in the flank. Got that?
- Yep.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.359
Knock them down and win a prize.

44:53.324 --> 44:55.224
Cotton candy coming up.

45:04.501 --> 45:08.733
A young girl at a fair
and she doesn't see anything but her man.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.675
- I love him.
- Do you, now?

45:12.142 --> 45:14.042
Well, he's a fine one.

45:15.079 --> 45:16.671
He is, isn't he?

45:18.015 --> 45:19.642
He is who he is.

45:20.084 --> 45:22.518
If you could see under this jacket,
you'd know.

45:22.586 --> 45:26.317
Four slugs I took in this gut.
But Nick wouldn't let me die.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.120
Was it in the war?

45:31.395 --> 45:33.124
You might say that.

45:34.765 --> 45:36.096
Very good.

45:36.533 --> 45:39.434
How about you?
You want to shake my hand? All right.

45:39.503 --> 45:43.735
Good. Got your hair cut, didn't you?
Used to be way down to there.

45:44.541 --> 45:46.202
Okay, here we are.

45:47.177 --> 45:51.113
Third prize for you,
you old sweet doll, you, you little devil.

45:52.683 --> 45:55.914
Here you are, first prize.
Congratulations.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.145
Joe.

45:59.223 --> 46:01.817
Okay. Take it to the ranch, will you?

46:08.165 --> 46:10.497
- I'll just lighten you up.
- Thank you.

46:10.567 --> 46:12.899
Real fine beef you got there, sonny.

46:12.970 --> 46:14.733
Count them out, Joe.

46:16.674 --> 46:17.936
Come on.

46:18.876 --> 46:20.241
He's a pet.

46:20.411 --> 46:23.903
You go home and fatten up
another one for me, hear?

46:25.783 --> 46:27.751
Do you wanna buy a goat?

46:29.153 --> 46:30.177
No.

46:48.472 --> 46:51.839
He's the expert from Chicago.
I heard people talking.

46:52.743 --> 46:55.473
Well, what do you think? Was it all right?

46:55.546 --> 46:57.571
Right tasty. It's smooth.

46:57.981 --> 46:59.209
The milk?

47:04.188 --> 47:05.314
Well?

47:05.456 --> 47:09.051
Well, the fact is, I think
I'd better have a little more.

47:19.737 --> 47:21.068
Full body.

47:21.371 --> 47:24.101
You're certainly a man who knows his milk.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.166
Well, you're certainly a woman
who knows milk.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.247
First prize.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.214
Violet!

47:48.565 --> 47:50.863
Violet, it's so good to see....

47:50.934 --> 47:53.869
Violet? It's me, Poppy.

47:55.405 --> 47:57.464
She ain't feeling so good.

48:01.745 --> 48:04.680
We're gonna work real hard
and get a first next year, aren't we?

48:04.748 --> 48:06.511
Huh? Right?

48:06.583 --> 48:08.346
How about you?

48:08.418 --> 48:10.443
Nick, we were waiting on you.

48:10.521 --> 48:12.614
Judging the price of kids, huh?

48:12.689 --> 48:15.681
No, not these little hunkers.
I wouldn't give them away.

48:15.759 --> 48:18.125
They're right smart Kansas kids.

48:18.962 --> 48:21.795
- What are you looking at?
- Me. Hello, Nick.

48:22.299 --> 48:23.664
Clarabelle.

48:24.034 --> 48:26.559
Well, it looks just like old times.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.337
Hello, Shay.

48:30.107 --> 48:33.770
- Your old bull won first prize.
- Hey, how about that?

48:36.380 --> 48:38.507
Don't she look swell, Nick?

48:38.682 --> 48:40.809
She dresses better
than the Governor's wife.

48:40.884 --> 48:43.409
Clarabelle could always think ahead.

48:44.621 --> 48:46.486
You haven't changed a bit, Nick.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.991
Nobody does. Not where it counts.

48:50.194 --> 48:51.889
I'll have to chew on that for a while.

48:51.962 --> 48:54.556
No. You ain't gonna chew on anything.

48:55.299 --> 48:57.324
Just go and talk to the Senator.

48:57.401 --> 48:59.198
See you around, Nick.

49:01.538 --> 49:03.733
What do you think of all this, Nick?

49:05.042 --> 49:06.771
I think it stinks.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.642
You would.

49:09.379 --> 49:11.438
All you know is concrete.

49:12.416 --> 49:14.043
You know, my family were Americans...

49:14.117 --> 49:16.915
when yours was still digging the bugs
out of Irish potatoes.

49:16.987 --> 49:19.512
Go on, wave a flag and make me laugh.

49:19.590 --> 49:22.855
Wait a minute.
You think I don't know this country?

49:23.694 --> 49:26.595
I know it. This is my country.

49:27.831 --> 49:31.494
I give it just what it wants:
Dope and flesh.

49:31.568 --> 49:35.231
Something up the arm,
something to lick around the belly.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.865
Did you have a good time last night?

49:50.053 --> 49:51.111
Joe.

49:58.328 --> 50:01.786
Joe. I thought you were back
in New York with Uncle Frank.

50:01.865 --> 50:03.332
Times change.

50:07.371 --> 50:10.067
- Don't they?
- This is not Chicago, Nick.

50:10.474 --> 50:12.237
No Loops, no taxis.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.606
This is my country.

50:15.812 --> 50:17.507
You just bought the farm.

50:17.581 --> 50:19.515
Not me. You.

50:20.250 --> 50:23.185
Mary Ann, the turkey shoot's
about to begin.

50:25.289 --> 50:27.120
Let's win us a prize.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.388
Just let my boys show you around.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.562
You little....

50:43.340 --> 50:44.534
Violet!

50:55.619 --> 50:57.246
That ain't fair.

51:21.812 --> 51:24.610
- I'll go for the car. Keep looking.
- Yeah.

52:43.827 --> 52:44.851
<i>Center target.</i>

52:44.928 --> 52:46.828
<i>Contestant number two.</i>

52:48.031 --> 52:51.000
<i>We'll shoot off
all of our turkeys later on.</i>

52:56.373 --> 52:59.035
<i>Six hits to center target.</i>

52:59.676 --> 53:02.770
<i>Contestant number three, you may fire.</i>

53:15.992 --> 53:19.655
<i>Will the young lady and gentleman
in their Sunday go-to-meeting clothes...</i>

53:19.729 --> 53:22.596
- <i>please clear the track?</i>
- Out of my way, all of you. Now move.

53:22.833 --> 53:26.200
<i>You are dangerously close
to the firing line.</i>

53:27.437 --> 53:28.802
Go, go, go.

53:29.439 --> 53:33.705
<i>Contestant number three
scored five hits to center target.</i>

53:33.777 --> 53:35.267
No, I'm sorry.

53:40.150 --> 53:41.515
Over there.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.884
- How you kids doing?
- Fine.

53:50.093 --> 53:51.355
Just.... Out of my way. Move.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.359
Damned if I see him anywhere.

55:36.433 --> 55:37.525
Me, neither.

55:37.601 --> 55:40.195
Maybe they're still hiding in the woods.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.125
- How you doing, kid?
- Okay.

56:41.598 --> 56:43.828
I'm sorry it was a lousy fair.

56:44.334 --> 56:45.733
But what....

56:46.603 --> 56:48.730
They're trying to kill you.

56:49.472 --> 56:51.497
Well, that's nothing new.

56:54.377 --> 56:55.901
- How's your spunk, kid?
- Okay.

56:55.979 --> 56:57.503
Okay, let's go.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.217
What have they done to Violet?

57:09.292 --> 57:11.453
The same thing
they would have done to you.

57:36.219 --> 57:37.447
Get up!

58:34.978 --> 58:36.138
There they are!

59:16.886 --> 59:17.944
Now!

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.659
- Take care of her.
- Yeah.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.925
Oh, and find some wheels
to fit between those.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.524
- I'll see you back at the hotel.
- Yeah, Nick, okay.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.263
Thanks for the lift, kid.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.363
Look, buy your club a case of beer.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.233
Hello, Nick.

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.930
Hello, Clarabelle.

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:26.273
I thought you might come around
to see an old friend.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.704
Well, I certainly wouldn't miss you.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.314
I gave all my sailors a long shore leave.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.911
Well, they probably needed the rest.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.788
Haven't you heard, Nick? I'm a good woman.

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.989
What's it like to be married?

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.755
- Well, it's...
- To Mary Ann?

01:02:55.772 --> 01:03:00.141
He does just fine for me.
He loves me better than his blue-ribbon bull.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.213
And I have a house in the Riviera
in my own name...

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.716
and a ton of Hong Kong gold
stuffed in a Swiss bank...

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.780
and a cosmetic factory, fancy-smelling.

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:14.022
Pig grease, and fat, and slop.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.990
And I live in a yacht named <i>Clarabelle.</i>

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.791
And it feels great.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.097
- You've won.
- Yeah.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.369
- We've come a long way, Nick.
- 604 miles.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.775
They tell good stories about you now.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.177
- Good tough ones.
- Hard ones.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:51.522
What did you come here for,
Mary Ann or me?

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.856
Mary Ann.

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:01.462
Mary Ann's in the icehouse
freezing things.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.873
Me, I'm already thawed.

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:10.704
Miss Chicago?

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.672
Stick Chicago.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.414
But I've missed you, Nick.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:20.456
- It was great being your girl.
- Yeah, but we wore it out.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.991
No. We could still make it together again.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:26.517
I'm very young,
and I wouldn't even mind being a widow.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.361
You're really something, Clarabelle.

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.632
You really are.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.781
Did you set up Mary Ann against Chicago...

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.942
just for old times' sake?

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.450
I don't run Mary Ann.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:57.458
I just push a man as far as he will go
and hope to hell it's the graveyard.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.859
Then you'd better make it quick.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.322
'Cause I'm liable to beat you to it.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.890
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:30.118
Kicking your ass down to Missouri.

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:31.717
Son of a bitch!

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:57.947
<i>Code 2.</i>

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:03.549
- Mary Ann's boys broke in, Nick.
- They used a sawed-off shotgun.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.218
- What about the girl?
- They got her.

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:08.024
Shaughnessy and I,
we were in the garage getting a new car.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.758
- Everything's in it.
- Let's go.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.933
Let's get out of here.

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.292
Violet?

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.315
Weenie was all through with me.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.146
Really through.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:48.692
He said they could love me for a nickel.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:56.427
He brought Poppy here,
and he made her watch.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.761
God damn them, Shay.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.363
God damn them, kid.

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.761
- They'll be waiting.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.261
All staked out.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.535
Yeah.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.410
It don't bother me.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.140
Don't it, kid?

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:20.147
Nope.

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:42.772
God damn them, Shay.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:53.977
Come on, Big!

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:16.336
You stay here. I'll be back for you.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:13.063
Just do as you're told, friend,
and keep moving.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.765
Faster.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.681
Turn in here. Do it!

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.867
He's coming in.

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.088
You're up next, Nick.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.134
Mary Ann?

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.988
Nick!

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.930
Kill me, Nick.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:06.075
Finish me off, Nick.

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.477
Do it!

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.688
You would for a beast.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.527
You're a man.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.560
There's no difference.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.565
You're wrong.

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.164
There is.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.028
Well, what do you want?

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.796
Them. All of them.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.764
Say, who do you think you are?

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.536
J. Edgar Hoover.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.337
- This is an orphanage.
- And I'm adopting.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.279
- Shay, get them out.
- A pleasure, Nick.

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:52.719
You can't come in....
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:54.220
You sure do.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.825
You've got fine style.

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.886
Glad you think so, Nick.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:08.602
Olive. Hi, Daisy. How are you?

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.273
Where are you taking me?

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.576
Tell me where.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.482
Chicago.

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.851
Chicago. What's it like?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.090
Well, it's windy...

01:25:36.398 --> 01:25:37.729
and calm...

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.291
and peaceful as any place anywhere.
