Ok, kids, thank you
for joining me here

00:21.952 --> 00:23.586
In the walk-in.
Thank you all.

00:23.654 --> 00:24.854
You said we
had to, so...

00:24.922 --> 00:26.155
Shush.
Brr!

00:26.223 --> 00:27.423
I should have brought
my cardigan.

00:27.491 --> 00:29.292
I have an announcement
about the restaurant.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.894
Here in this box
is the beef

00:30.961 --> 00:33.496
That will make our--
gene, drumroll, please.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.899
[imitating rock 'n' roll

00:40.304 --> 00:41.704

Gene.

00:45.776 --> 00:47.577
That will make
our 100,000th burger.

00:47.645 --> 00:48.578
Wow.

00:48.646 --> 00:49.579
Can I touch it?

00:49.647 --> 00:51.180
I wanna touch it, too.

00:51.248 --> 00:53.182
I wanna feel it
between my toes. Mmm.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.351
I wanna put a stick
of dynamite in it

00:55.419 --> 00:56.452
And blow it up!

00:56.520 --> 00:58.087
No. What is wrong
with all of you?

00:58.155 --> 00:59.522
No one's touching
this meat but me.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.157
I have an
announcement, too.

01:01.225 --> 01:02.525
My bra
is chafing me.

01:02.593 --> 01:03.826
That's not
a real announcement.

01:03.894 --> 01:04.827
Oh! I have one.

01:04.894 --> 01:06.329
I love...

01:06.397 --> 01:07.330

01:13.304 --> 01:14.537
Oh, congratulations.

01:14.605 --> 01:16.940
Can't believe they're
making you wait 3 days.

01:17.007 --> 01:18.775
Stop stealing
my thunder!

01:18.842 --> 01:21.377
I found the banner!

It's from our old printer.

100,000 ages ago.

Heh. We were way off.

01:29.687 --> 01:31.220
Yeah.
Big time.

01:31.288 --> 01:32.355
Ha hah!

01:32.423 --> 01:34.090
Can I just--
stop it!

There it is.

01:36.477 --> 01:37.660

[normal]
heh. I'm not.

01:53.277 --> 01:54.544
Whoa. Linda!

01:54.611 --> 01:56.346
I think the news is here!

01:56.413 --> 01:58.915
I wonder if they heard
about our 100,000th burger!

01:58.983 --> 02:00.483
What?!

02:00.551 --> 02:03.386
Hi. How are you? Uh,
what can I do for you?

02:03.454 --> 02:04.420
Are you bob?

The documentary
filmmaker.

02:09.493 --> 02:10.727
Ok. Uh...

02:10.794 --> 02:12.862
We're making
a film about
the beef industry.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.330
I heard you
were about to hit

02:14.398 --> 02:16.466
Your 100,000th
burger,

02:16.533 --> 02:19.268
And I wanted
to shake your hand.

02:19.336 --> 02:20.803
Oh. Yeah. Um...

02:20.871 --> 02:24.273
Because you,
sir, have blood
on your hands.

02:24.341 --> 02:26.542
Eww. Is this ketchup?

02:26.610 --> 02:28.644
It's the blood
of 100,000
slaughtered cows.

02:28.712 --> 02:30.179
You ketchuped me.

02:30.247 --> 02:32.715

to force you to face
your victims.

Her name
is moolissa.

She's due
to be "processed"
in 5 days, bob,

to spare her life.

02:44.695 --> 02:46.562

her fate.

conscience tells you

When you're
looking your burger
right in the eye.

02:57.941 --> 02:59.442
Ow! This is ridiculous.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.744
It's not a crime
to make burgers.

03:01.812 --> 03:03.880
There's no blood
on our hands!

03:03.947 --> 03:06.949
What's all
the yelling about?

03:07.017 --> 03:10.753
Louise: Turns out dad's
been putting murdered cows
in our hamburgers.

03:10.821 --> 03:13.489
And you made us
a part of it!

03:13.557 --> 03:14.757

03:15.826 --> 03:18.027
Oh, look. A cow.

03:18.095 --> 03:19.629
Hello, blondie.

03:19.696 --> 03:22.365
Oops. I got
some meat on you.

03:22.433 --> 03:25.034

Gross. Heh heh.

03:25.102 --> 03:26.335
Ohh. God.

03:26.403 --> 03:28.304
Uh, not a good time, linda.

03:28.372 --> 03:29.705
Heh heh. Ooh.

03:31.223 --> 03:32.757
Randy, stop.
Stop filming. You know,

03:32.825 --> 03:34.459
We're not gonna be in
your cow documentary anymore.

03:34.526 --> 03:36.494
Well, you don't really
have a choice, bob,

03:36.562 --> 03:39.530
'cause I stop at nothing
to expose injustice
to animals.

03:39.598 --> 03:41.132
Is that wig glued on?

03:41.200 --> 03:43.401
Yeah. It's--
it's the only way
it would stay put.

03:43.469 --> 03:44.736
It's to, uh,
humanize her.

03:44.803 --> 03:45.770
It's cute.

03:45.838 --> 03:46.938
Mmm.
I've seen cuter.

03:47.006 --> 03:48.172
Honestly, she's a 4.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.241
Randy, I--I don't know
where to begin.

03:50.309 --> 03:52.443
You know, this isn't
even a female cow.

03:52.511 --> 03:55.146
Beef happens
to come from steers,
which are male cows.

03:55.214 --> 03:57.482
Then, uh, how do you
explain that udder?

03:57.549 --> 03:58.916
Whoa. What an udder.

03:58.984 --> 04:00.385
Bob: Get away
from there, tina.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.086
That's, uh, not an udder.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.121
Oh, it's not?

04:03.188 --> 04:04.922
Don't listen
to him, randy.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.858
You go ahead and
milk that cow.

04:06.925 --> 04:08.259
Milk it good.
Oh, we did.

04:08.327 --> 04:10.795
You shouldn't have.
Milk doesn't come out of that.

04:10.863 --> 04:13.331
Somethin' came out of it
in that bucket
over there.

04:13.399 --> 04:14.932
You mean this
bucket of urine?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.634
I know urine,
and that's
urine.

04:16.702 --> 04:18.202
Gene, put that down.
No!

04:18.269 --> 04:19.904
Well, it certainly
smells like urine,

04:19.971 --> 04:21.471
But that's probably
because she's sick.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.540
No, she's not sick.

04:22.608 --> 04:24.342
Sick of
your practices, bob!

04:24.410 --> 04:27.211
Ok. You know,
we're gonna go inside
and call animal control,

04:27.279 --> 04:28.646
And then you'll
have to leave.

you guys later.

Sir, sir, the only thing
dangerous about this cow

Is how adorable it is.
Moo.

04:57.409 --> 04:59.544
Put your hand on
this cow and touch it.
What?

04:59.611 --> 05:01.379
I just know that that's
gonna help you.

05:01.447 --> 05:02.480

07:54.753 --> 07:55.620
Everybody wins, bob.

07:55.687 --> 07:57.121
I guess
you're right.

07:57.189 --> 07:59.690
I mean, looks kind
of sweet out there--

07:59.758 --> 08:02.193
Enjoying the day,
meeting people.

08:02.261 --> 08:03.361
Hi, cow.

08:03.428 --> 08:05.363
I'm gonna eat you.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.098
Whoa.
Can it hear us?

08:07.165 --> 08:08.132
[linda munching]

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Easy.

08:09.268 --> 08:10.534
Like sands
through the hourglass,

08:10.602 --> 08:12.770
There goes my teeth
right into your back.

08:12.838 --> 08:14.105
That's my wife.

08:14.172 --> 08:15.840
Ah, bobby,
I'm friggin' starvin'.

08:15.907 --> 08:19.277
Who could eat
that beautiful
creature?

08:19.344 --> 08:20.511
Shame on you!

08:20.579 --> 08:23.414
Are you going to be
eating a burger today?

08:23.482 --> 08:25.650
We wouldn't dream
of eating an animal.

08:25.717 --> 08:28.119
We run a petting zoo
by the interstate.

08:28.186 --> 08:30.655
It's called
mother goose's
discount petting zoo.

08:30.722 --> 08:32.490
Petting horses,
goats, and sheep.

08:32.557 --> 08:34.325
Precious memories
on the cheap.

08:34.393 --> 08:36.460
It's basically
an animal sanctuary...

08:36.528 --> 08:38.462
That we
make money off of.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.865
Exactly.
[chuckles]

08:43.735 --> 08:45.803
Oh. Hey, randy,
thanks for the business.

08:45.871 --> 08:47.571
[sarcastic]
oh, hey, bob,
you're welcome.

08:47.639 --> 08:50.207
Well, I'm gonna
go to bed soon.
What are you gonna do?

08:50.275 --> 08:53.144
Oh, I'll probably
go to bed, too,
'cause I'm a person.

08:53.211 --> 08:54.378
Bye.

08:56.281 --> 08:58.783
[sizzling]

09:00.252 --> 09:01.686
M-moolissa, watch out!

09:03.822 --> 09:05.256
No!

09:05.324 --> 09:07.158
Bring in the accused.

09:07.225 --> 09:09.427
[crowd clamoring]

09:09.494 --> 09:10.561
Yeah, yeah.

09:10.629 --> 09:12.530
Louise, you're defending me?

09:12.597 --> 09:13.631
[gavel bangs]

09:13.699 --> 09:17.301
This so-called "man"
stands accused

09:17.369 --> 09:22.206
Of murdering nearly
100,000 hamburgers
worth of cows.

09:22.274 --> 09:24.942
I call to the stand
moolissa.

09:25.010 --> 09:25.943
[crowd murmuring]

09:26.011 --> 09:27.278
Objection!

09:27.346 --> 09:30.381
That cow's faking
his injuries!

09:30.449 --> 09:31.782
And I can prove it.

09:31.850 --> 09:33.017
Think fast.

09:34.586 --> 09:35.920
Overruled.

09:35.987 --> 09:38.856
Moolissa, is the man
who killed you

09:38.924 --> 09:41.292
In the courtroom today?

09:41.360 --> 09:42.727
Bob: It's me!

09:42.794 --> 09:43.828
It's me.

09:43.895 --> 09:45.963
I just
make hamburgers.

09:46.031 --> 09:48.699
I never wanted
to be a cow killer.

09:48.767 --> 09:52.720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:52.804 --> 09:54.805
[gasps]
[snores]

09:54.873 --> 09:55.906
Whoa.
Heavy sleeper.

09:55.974 --> 09:57.241
Wha--what happened?

09:57.309 --> 09:58.943
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

09:59.010 --> 10:00.478
Go back to bed.
[sighs]

10:00.545 --> 10:02.380
I'm sorry.
Go back to bed.

10:02.447 --> 10:03.881
[thunder crashes]

10:03.949 --> 10:05.883
[moolissa mooing]

10:11.390 --> 10:13.190
Hey! Randy!

10:13.258 --> 10:15.359
Your cow's gonna freeze
to death out here!

10:15.427 --> 10:17.895
Randy!

10:20.766 --> 10:22.466
Bob: Shh. Easy.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.735
Easy. Back up.
Back up. Back up.

10:24.803 --> 10:27.238
[gasps]
oh, my god.

10:27.305 --> 10:29.540
Heh. I know.
It's a cow!

10:29.608 --> 10:32.009
You know what?
You won't even know it's here.

10:33.478 --> 10:36.814
Uh, that was
like that already.

10:36.882 --> 10:38.516
Definitely clean that.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.650
Oop. Step back.

10:39.718 --> 10:42.486
This is the best
dream I've ever had!

10:42.554 --> 10:44.855
Everybody pee
on the floor!

10:44.923 --> 10:47.858
Who's with me?!

10:48.888 --> 10:50.622
Ok, eat while it's hot.

10:50.690 --> 10:53.425
Well, well, well.
Look who's too good
for cereal now.

10:53.493 --> 10:55.460
He's trying to
impress the cow.

10:55.528 --> 10:56.828
Don't be ridiculous.

10:56.896 --> 10:58.563
Someone knows
how to treat

10:58.631 --> 10:59.998
A lady-slash-
male steer.

11:00.066 --> 11:03.001
Bob, I am not
comfortable with
this situation.

11:03.069 --> 11:04.536
Lin, what was I
supposed to do?

11:04.604 --> 11:06.071
I had that crazy dream.
It was raining.

11:06.139 --> 11:07.906
Well, I had
a crazy dream

11:07.974 --> 11:10.442
That there wouldn't
be a cow's a-s-s

11:10.510 --> 11:13.078
In my face when I'm
eating my breakfast.

11:13.146 --> 11:14.813
I know what that spells.

11:14.881 --> 11:16.014
Ass.
Ass.

11:16.082 --> 11:17.015
Mom. Heh.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.016
Ass.
Stop it.

11:18.084 --> 11:18.917
Say good-bye,
everybody.

11:18.985 --> 11:20.585
It's going out

11:20.653 --> 11:22.587
On the street,
where it
belongs.

11:22.655 --> 11:24.189
Of course, ok?
Of course.

11:24.257 --> 11:25.157
Right after breakfast.

11:25.224 --> 11:27.793
Cows can't
go down stairs.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.928
What?
What's that?

11:29.996 --> 11:31.596
Cows can't
go down stairs.

11:31.664 --> 11:32.831
That's, like,
a thing.

11:32.899 --> 11:33.832
I've heard that.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.068
It's like a fun fact.

11:36.135 --> 11:37.202
Bobby...
Hmm.

11:37.270 --> 11:39.037
Cows can't
go down stairs?

11:39.105 --> 11:40.772
That better not be true.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.008
[bob grunting]

11:44.310 --> 11:45.677
Huh.
What do you know?

11:45.745 --> 11:48.113
We know you'll push
on a cow's butt

11:48.181 --> 11:50.582
For half an hour
without asking for help.

11:50.650 --> 11:52.818
Gotta have that butt
all to yourself.

11:52.885 --> 11:56.054
Randy: Hey, bob!
What's the deal, man?

11:56.122 --> 11:57.756
What'd you do
to moolissa?

11:57.824 --> 11:59.825
It's up here!
Come get it out!

11:59.892 --> 12:02.027
Linda. Uh, it's not
up here, randy.

12:02.095 --> 12:03.195
My wife's crazy. Shh.

12:03.262 --> 12:05.197
If he knows
I brought the cow in,

12:05.264 --> 12:06.264
He'll think he won.

12:06.332 --> 12:07.699
So what if he won?

12:07.767 --> 12:09.701
Get the cow out
of the house now.

12:09.769 --> 12:11.770
Stop.
You get it out
of t the house.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.205
I'm trying to--
come get--

12:13.272 --> 12:14.773
Oh. Uh, this cow.

12:14.841 --> 12:16.641
This cow, yeah, is here.

12:16.709 --> 12:17.642
Aha!

12:17.710 --> 12:19.311
Dad, I ran
that bubble bath

12:19.378 --> 12:21.279
For you and
moolissa like
you wanted.

12:21.347 --> 12:22.748
Bubbles!

12:22.815 --> 12:25.150
I'm not taking a bath
with moolissa, randy.

12:25.218 --> 12:26.718
2 days left.

12:26.786 --> 12:29.988
2 days to decide
to send that cow
to slaughter

12:30.056 --> 12:33.892
Or admit
you're a hypocrite
and a murderer.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.961
Wow.
What a movie.

12:36.028 --> 12:37.863
Bob,
what a movie.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.331
It's not my movie,
teddy.

12:39.398 --> 12:40.632
What, are they just

12:40.700 --> 12:41.767
Followin' you around
with a camera?

12:41.834 --> 12:42.968
You're in it,
you're the star,

12:43.035 --> 12:44.169
But it's not
your movie.

12:44.237 --> 12:45.203
Heh.
Good luck, guys.

12:45.271 --> 12:47.139
Will you sign a release?
Sure.

12:47.206 --> 12:49.141
Do you want
my johnk hancock?

12:49.208 --> 12:50.142
Yeah.
Anywhere?

12:50.209 --> 12:51.676
No. O-on the line here.

12:51.744 --> 12:53.278
Better get used
to this, huh?

12:53.346 --> 12:54.946
Gonna be
in the movies. I--

12:55.014 --> 12:57.282
Just on the line.
Just on the line.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.283
Right--
so anywhere?
Yeah.

12:58.351 --> 13:00.185
No! No! Where it
says signature!

13:00.253 --> 13:02.921
Ok, what's your name?
Do you want it to you?

13:02.989 --> 13:04.723
No, I--
teddy, what are you doing?!

13:04.791 --> 13:07.058
I'm signing here
an autograph, bob.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.335
[sighs]
one big happy family.

13:17.403 --> 13:19.838
Isn't this nice,
all of us here together?

13:19.906 --> 13:21.773
No.
Are you gonna give me

13:21.841 --> 13:23.708
A poop tonight?
Talk to me.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.677
Mmm. Bob, huh?

13:25.745 --> 13:28.246
Well, it's nice.
They like each other.

13:28.314 --> 13:29.915
It's good for tina.

13:29.982 --> 13:33.018
Come on. Just relax
and--pbbbt!

13:33.085 --> 13:35.153
It's all about
the communication

13:35.221 --> 13:36.955
Pbbbt.

13:40.293 --> 13:42.060
Uh-oh.

13:43.062 --> 13:45.130
Hi, moolissa.

13:45.198 --> 13:46.264
[gasps]
frowny face?

13:46.332 --> 13:48.266
All I've been
is super nice to you,

13:48.334 --> 13:50.001
And this is
the thanks I get?

13:50.069 --> 13:51.403
I loved you.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.271
I loved you like a horse,

13:53.339 --> 13:54.840
Which is my favorite animal.

13:54.907 --> 13:56.908
You know what?
Let's just stop

13:56.976 --> 13:59.177
Before we both say
something we'll regret,

13:59.245 --> 14:01.379
Like that horses
are better than cows.

14:01.447 --> 14:02.280
I regret that.

14:02.348 --> 14:03.615
But it's true.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.187
Where's the cow?

14:09.255 --> 14:11.690
I believe you
mean, "where's
the steer? "

14:11.757 --> 14:13.758
Yeah. Don't forget
about that penis.

14:13.826 --> 14:14.759
Yeah.

14:14.827 --> 14:16.027
Moolissa?

14:16.095 --> 14:17.028
Moolissa?

14:17.096 --> 14:19.364
Ha! Cows can
go down stairs.

14:19.432 --> 14:21.867
All you need
is 4 wool socks,

14:21.934 --> 14:24.769
A mattress,
and the will
to make it happen.

14:24.837 --> 14:25.971
You didn't.

14:26.038 --> 14:29.207
Your girlfriend
is tied up outside.

14:30.877 --> 14:31.810
Uh-oh.

14:31.878 --> 14:34.246
Nooooo

14:34.313 --> 14:36.081
Oooo...
What's wrong with dad?

14:36.148 --> 14:38.183
Oooo...
I think he hates leashes.

14:38.251 --> 14:39.584
Ooo!

14:41.320 --> 14:43.155
It's not
my fault, randy.

14:43.222 --> 14:44.856
She was stolen. I mean,
it's no one's fault.

14:44.924 --> 14:45.924
Except for linda's.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.592
I did what I had to do

14:47.660 --> 14:49.227
To protect my family
and my carpet.

14:49.295 --> 14:51.396
Yeah, whatever.
So who do we know

14:51.464 --> 14:54.266
That would steal a cow
in a blonde wig?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.334
Maybe some perverts.
Heh heh.

14:56.402 --> 14:58.303
We had a fight
last night,
me and moolissa.

14:58.371 --> 15:00.906
I just wish I had
a chance to make
things right again.

15:00.973 --> 15:04.309
You wouldn't if you
heard some of the things
she was pooping about you.

15:04.377 --> 15:05.310
Hey, guys!

15:05.378 --> 15:06.945
Take a look at this!

15:07.013 --> 15:08.447
[fast-forwarding]
...On the cheap.

15:08.514 --> 15:09.548
[fast-forwarding]

15:09.615 --> 15:11.416
You fellas just
leave her tied up

15:11.484 --> 15:12.784
Here at night
all alone?

15:12.852 --> 15:14.820
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She doesn't mind.

15:14.887 --> 15:18.490
We could just back
a trailer right up
here, honey, huh?

15:18.558 --> 15:20.759
We sure could,
get ourselves a cow.

15:20.827 --> 15:22.894
Yeah.
Get ourselves a cow.

15:22.962 --> 15:24.629
Yeah.
Get ourselves a c--

15:24.697 --> 15:27.132
[both laughing]

15:34.340 --> 15:36.374
What a dump.

15:36.442 --> 15:37.943
Yikes.
Hey, there she is.

15:38.010 --> 15:39.811
Oh, dear god.

15:39.879 --> 15:42.781
[gasps] oh, the cow
that jumped over the moon.

15:42.849 --> 15:44.182
See, that's nice.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.251
Come on.
Let's go get her.

15:46.319 --> 15:47.686
We should come back
after dark.

15:47.753 --> 15:48.954
Why?
It's more dramatic.

15:49.021 --> 15:51.389
That is stupid.
No. No, no, no.

15:51.457 --> 15:53.758
I can see it now,
the big rescue.

15:53.826 --> 15:56.261
We'll shoot
the whole thing
in infrared.

15:56.329 --> 15:58.663
Oh, randy, com--
in infrared?

16:00.800 --> 16:01.766
This is nuts.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.969
The kids should be
in bed, bob.

16:04.036 --> 16:05.770
It's infrared, lin.
Show her.

16:05.838 --> 16:07.339
Oh.

16:07.406 --> 16:08.340
Yeah.

16:08.407 --> 16:09.341
Coo! Coo!

16:09.408 --> 16:10.742
Why are you doing that?

16:10.810 --> 16:11.810
I'm signaling.

16:11.878 --> 16:13.478
Everybody,
serpentine.

16:13.546 --> 16:15.547
Gene: Yes!
We're a unit.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.433
Dad, you should know

16:18.518 --> 16:19.551

Bob, we're here.
What do we do now?

We, uh, uh,

High-five, randy.
Nice job.

I mean, we couldn't have
done it without the kids
biting that woman.

gonna guilt-trip me?

the whole movie
is about.

I thought we were
friends now, randy,

the cow together!

I didn't hit her!
I--I stopped!

17:56.048 --> 17:57.616
She's probably fine.

17:57.683 --> 18:00.051
She's dead.
She must have had
a cow heart attack.

Look, ever since
I met you,

makes me feel like
a horrible person.
