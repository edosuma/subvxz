00:36.411 --> 00:39.758
This is our planet's hothouse.
The jungle.

00:40.103 --> 00:42.759
The tropical rainforest.

00:44.996 --> 00:48.748
Forests like these occupy only three percent
of the land

00:48.866 --> 00:53.305
yet they're home to over half
of the world's species.

00:54.483 --> 00:58.275
But how do so many different kinds of plants
and animals

00:58.373 --> 01:02.340
find the space here to live
alongside one another?

01:14.442 --> 01:20.532
On the dark, humid forest floor
the jungle appears to be lifeless.

01:21.573 --> 01:25.757
Often the only signs of life
are what you hear.

01:32.319 --> 01:37.092
A male blue bird of paradise
is advertising for a mate.

01:39.018 --> 01:40.569
It's quite a performance

01:40.648 --> 01:45.873
but he's not the only bird of paradise here
keen to make an impression.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.962
There are nearly forty different kinds
on the island of New Guinea

01:51.040 --> 01:55.145
each with a display
seemingly more bizarre than the rest.

02:04.181 --> 02:07.108
A riflebird of paradise.

02:17.087 --> 02:22.311
Like many jungle animals,
birds of paradise avoid competing with each other

02:22.312 --> 02:28.068
and these do so by living in different parts
of this jungle covered island.

02:33.470 --> 02:40.680
The six plumed bird of paradise
displays in his special clearing, on the forest floor.

02:47.083 --> 02:52.838
The magnificent bird of paradise
favors the low branches of bushes.

02:56.296 --> 03:00.107
His female is modestly dressed.

03:11.637 --> 03:14.289
The male has a good set of lungs

03:14.347 --> 03:19.769
but he'll have to do more than
flutter his eyelids, if he wants to impress her.

03:26.094 --> 03:28.609
It'll all depend on his performance.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.665
The females may be dull looking
but they're very picky

03:39.530 --> 03:43.302
and it's time for a really close inspection.

03:48.831 --> 03:53.692
His right side looks fine...
but what about his left?

03:57.684 --> 04:02.205
Pretty impressive,
but is he magnificent enough?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.596
Oh dear. Her departure says it all.

04:08.213 --> 04:12.310
Generations of choosy females
have driven the evolution

04:12.415 --> 04:14.772
of these remarkable displays.

04:15.833 --> 04:20.630
The more extravagant a male is,
the more likely he'll be noticed.

04:46.338 --> 04:52.898
New Guinea lies in a warm tropical belt
that girdles our planet around the equator.

04:53.259 --> 04:56.655
With abundant rainfall
and 12 hours of daylight

04:56.741 --> 05:03.279
365 days a year,
it's here that rainforests flourish.

05:08.097 --> 05:14.530
Surprisingly only two percent of the sunlight
filters down to the forest floor.

05:16.461 --> 05:20.558
Down here seedlings struggle to grow

05:20.940 --> 05:24.040
but the gloom is not eternal.

05:57.559 --> 06:01.635
The death of a forest giant
is always saddening

06:01.847 --> 06:06.433
but it has to happen
if the forest is to remain healthy.

06:08.046 --> 06:14.224
The sudden blaze of sunlight
will bring life to the forest floor.

06:17.324 --> 06:23.544
A single hectare of rainforest
may contain as many as 250 species of tree.

06:23.714 --> 06:27.005
That's nearly ten times the number
that grow in Britain

06:27.259 --> 06:32.672
and the thirst for light
triggers a race for a place in the sun.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.144
There's no time to waste.

06:50.228 --> 06:57.064
A seed that may have fallen
only a few days ago, now bursts through the leaf litter.

07:10.969 --> 07:16.340
With so many competitors,
getting a good start is critical

07:18.335 --> 07:22.135
but each plant has it's own particular strategy

07:22.326 --> 07:25.998
for making the most of this rare opportunity.

07:26.848 --> 07:29.650
The seeds of hardwoods are quick to germinate

07:29.820 --> 07:35.382
but, like the fabled tortoise,
their strategy is to be slow and steady.

07:40.010 --> 07:47.270
Vines and other climbers put all their energy
into rapid vertical growth, rather than girth

07:47.462 --> 07:50.519
though they'll need to be well supported.

07:56.485 --> 08:01.113
The climbers' strategy looks chaotic
but there's method in their madness.

08:01.155 --> 08:08.161
Their growing tips circle like lassoes,
searching out anchors for their spindly stems.

08:14.635 --> 08:16.822
They put coils in their tendrils

08:16.949 --> 08:21.429
so that if their support moves,
they will stretch and not snap.

08:24.061 --> 08:28.031
But the frontrunners at this stage,
the first to fill the clearing,

08:28.180 --> 08:31.406
are pioneers like the macarangas.

08:32.383 --> 08:38.857
Their immense leaves capture
huge amounts of sunlight, so fueling their growth.

08:44.931 --> 08:49.452
As a result the macarangas grow
a remarkable eight meters a year

08:49.538 --> 08:53.210
surging ahead of almost all their rivals.

09:05.927 --> 09:09.705
In the race for the top spot
hundreds will start

09:09.833 --> 09:16.690
yet few will ever reach the finishing line,
their growth cut short by the diminishing light.

09:19.195 --> 09:23.123
In less than four years,
the gap will have gone

09:23.441 --> 09:26.965
but that's not the end of the race.

09:35.563 --> 09:41.932
The ultimate winners are the tortoises,
the slow and steady hardwoods.

09:43.799 --> 09:46.984
When the short lived pioneers have fallen

09:47.238 --> 09:52.928
it's the hardwoods that take their place,
and a fifty meter giant, like this one,

09:53.140 --> 09:58.680
may keep it's place in the sun
for another two hundred years.

10:35.617 --> 10:39.949
At the top, is the canopy,
the engine room of the jungle.

10:40.224 --> 10:45.914
It's up here that most of the animal life
in the rainforest can be found

10:46.806 --> 10:54.490
But despite the apparent abundance
of vegetable food, gathering it is seldom easy.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.924
With no real seasons

11:10.306 --> 11:14.531
each tree flowers or fruits
at a different time of the year

11:14.595 --> 11:18.904
which means that food is very widely spaced.

11:23.935 --> 11:29.285
Monkeys, like these tamarinds,
must search the canopy for all kinds of food

11:29.497 --> 11:31.599
if they're to survive.

11:34.168 --> 11:39.263
but across the world's rainforests
there's one type of fruiting tree

11:39.347 --> 11:43.445
that always delivers:
the fig.

11:52.764 --> 11:59.133
Wherever they grow, figs are a magnet
for the great diversity of animals.

12:01.257 --> 12:06.075
In the Amazon, the first to appear
are the spider monkeys.

12:07.413 --> 12:10.703
These large primates
are big fig eaters

12:10.789 --> 12:16.287
But they won't have the tree
to themselves for long. Others will want a share.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.809
like the diminutive emperor tamarinds.

12:24.099 --> 12:30.382
The tamarinds love figs too, but being petite
means they're easily scared off.

12:40.593 --> 12:45.730
Squirrel monkeys are also small
but they have strength in numbers.

12:48.149 --> 12:54.305
Their timeshare on the tree may be short,
so their tactics are more smash and grab.

13:03.285 --> 13:06.766
Capuchin monkeys are the bully boys
in these forests

13:06.936 --> 13:10.482
and they want the ripe figs for themselves.

13:27.868 --> 13:32.050
Figs are one of the few trees
that fruit the year round

13:32.540 --> 13:39.289
so when other food is scarce, these fruits
are always available somewhere or other.

13:43.238 --> 13:49.309
Even for leaf eaters, like howler monkeys
the ripe figs are just too good to miss.

13:55.296 --> 14:00.370
And howlers are too big
for the capuchins to chase off.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.519
Figs are so popular, that as many as 44
different kinds of bird and monkey

14:09.647 --> 14:14.317
have been seen working a shift system
on a single tree.

14:23.275 --> 14:29.177
Because fruiting trees are so valuable,
many monkeys are territorial

14:29.346 --> 14:31.194
And if you live in the treetops

14:31.299 --> 14:36.671
there's perhaps no better way
of staking your claim to a territory, than this.

14:42.786 --> 14:46.798
The calls of the siamang gibbons begin
as a duet

14:46.799 --> 14:49.451
between the dominant male and female.

15:02.104 --> 15:08.451
The rest of their families soon join in,
and it results in a frenzy of activity.

15:16.942 --> 15:22.526
The calls can carry over a mile,
and their message is clear.

15:27.388 --> 15:32.864
They tell any neighboring siamangs
this is our territory. Keep out.

15:43.096 --> 15:48.680
Up here the calls of siamang gibbons
seem to dominate the airwaves

15:48.723 --> 15:51.609
but with the jungle's incredible diversity

15:51.610 --> 15:55.070
there are countless others
trying to be heard too.

16:01.290 --> 16:06.152
Every layer seems to beat to a different tune.

16:23.261 --> 16:27.889
In the early morning
the forest's chorus is particularly rich.

16:28.164 --> 16:32.113
Sounds travel further in the cooler air

16:35.721 --> 16:42.048
But few calls can penetrate as far
through the dense vegetation as this one

16:42.218 --> 16:46.676
the deep bass solo of a male orangutan.

17:02.363 --> 17:05.824
In the middle of the day
little stirs in the jungle

17:05.887 --> 17:10.579
and the hot dense air muffles the sound.

17:13.084 --> 17:18.795
As the afternoon wears on,
a different set of players begin to warm up.

17:20.917 --> 17:27.372
Insects work in harmony, timing their calls
to fall between the notes of others.

17:35.078 --> 17:38.135
Many singers stick to precise schedules

17:38.347 --> 17:42.445
and right on cue the six o'clock cicada.

17:54.735 --> 17:58.748
Night brings out a whole new orchestra.

18:23.311 --> 18:27.896
The cacophony of competing calls
seems deafening to us

18:28.087 --> 18:34.115
but frogs ears are tuned
to hear only the calls of their own kind.

18:41.206 --> 18:45.622
The songs of courtship echo from all around.

18:58.507 --> 19:04.197
Male gliding leaf frogs
leap from the treetops.

19:38.951 --> 19:45.787
To slow their descent,
they use their huge webbed feet as parachutes.

19:50.096 --> 19:55.084
These large tree frogs
spend most of their lives in the high canopy

19:55.191 --> 19:58.970
and only come down when it's time to breed.

20:04.446 --> 20:09.733
Once settled,
they begin to serenade their unseen females.

20:21.515 --> 20:25.909
Now it's time for the females
to make their move.

20:30.284 --> 20:35.420
There's no shortage of suitors,
but this female has already made her choice.

20:35.421 --> 20:41.408
She's heading towards the loudest call,
because loud calls come from big frogs

20:41.895 --> 20:49.707
and big is best, but to reach him she must run
the gauntlet of a gang of smaller suitors.

20:50.132 --> 20:55.077
Their only chance of mating
is to make a sneaky interception.

21:00.618 --> 21:02.083
He's scored.

21:02.231 --> 21:09.364
But with more females arriving all the time,
it's not over until the fat frog stops singing.

21:15.648 --> 21:21.337
Feet, so vital for gliding,
are now put to other uses.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.847
Two's company,
three's inconvenient

21:31.060 --> 21:35.752
but in any case, all male frogs
are equipped with dry thumbs

21:35.901 --> 21:40.762
which enable them to get a vice like grip
on their moist partners.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.516
It's a case of first come first served.

21:54.286 --> 22:01.057
Living in such a humid environment,
means jungle frogs are less tied to puddles and pools

22:01.249 --> 22:04.858
and these even lay their eggs out of water.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.235
There's little chance of them drying out

22:17.575 --> 22:21.460
and up here they're safer from predators.

22:28.763 --> 22:33.582
Surprisingly, it doesn't rain every day
in the rainforest

22:34.261 --> 22:38.062
but more still falls here
than anywhere else on Earth.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.565
On average,
over two meters a year.

22:51.776 --> 22:57.720
A single tree can suck up
hundreds of tons of water each year

23:00.182 --> 23:02.603
But the trees can't use all this water

23:02.730 --> 23:09.438
so, much of it returns to the air as vapor,
forming mist and clouds.

23:14.661 --> 23:19.565
In the Amazon, the largest unbroken stretch
of rainforest in the world,

23:19.756 --> 23:27.059
half of all the rainwater that falls,
comes from clouds produced by the trees themselves.

23:59.368 --> 24:05.015
With so much rain, it's not surprising
that many of the worlds largest rivers

24:05.206 --> 24:07.987
are found in rainforests.

24:23.060 --> 24:26.244
Inside the forest, the high humidity

24:26.350 --> 24:34.374
creates the perfect conditions
for a strange world, where life is built on decay.

24:46.284 --> 24:55.031
Amoeba like slime molds cruise the surface,
feeding on bacteria and rotting vegetation.

25:11.037 --> 25:15.241
Fungi also flourish on decay.

25:16.599 --> 25:21.716
These are the fruiting bodies of the fungi,
the only visible sign

25:21.821 --> 25:27.193
of a vast underground network
of fungal filaments.

25:58.612 --> 26:04.365
In temperate forests, the buildup of leaf litter
creates rich stores of nutrients.

26:04.579 --> 26:07.487
That however, doesn't happen here.

26:11.286 --> 26:15.469
Nutrients that reach the soil
are leeched out by the rain

26:15.510 --> 26:20.033
but fungi are connected to tree roots
by their underground filaments

26:20.203 --> 26:22.369
and by quickly consuming the dead

26:22.411 --> 26:28.079
they help to recycle crucial minerals
straight back into the trees.

26:34.745 --> 26:40.965
And this recycling happens faster here,
than anywhere else on the planet.

27:00.964 --> 27:06.292
There are thought to be nearly a million
different types of fungi in the tropics.

27:06.419 --> 27:10.877
The vast majority still unknown to science

27:17.097 --> 27:19.496
But one thing's for certain

27:19.686 --> 27:24.718
without fungi, rainforests could not exist.

27:35.777 --> 27:38.771
Nothing goes to waste in the rainforest.

27:39.026 --> 27:43.887
The fungi become food for others
like these beetle larvae.

27:48.197 --> 27:51.296
Finding the fungus isn't a problem
for the grubs

27:51.381 --> 27:55.966
since their caring parents
actually show them the way.

28:09.297 --> 28:14.583
Incredibly, 80% of all insects
live in jungles

28:14.966 --> 28:21.823
fewer more successful than the ants.
There can be 8 million individuals in a single hectare.

28:23.161 --> 28:27.299
but jungle ants
don't have it all their own way.

28:34.050 --> 28:39.315
These bullet ants are showing
some worrying symptoms.

28:39.910 --> 28:43.773
Spores from a parasitic fungus
called cordyceps

28:43.815 --> 28:48.167
have infiltrated
their bodies and their minds.

28:54.537 --> 28:59.440
It's infected brain
directs this ant upwards

29:00.926 --> 29:06.254
then, utterly disorientated,
it grips a stem with it's mandibles.

29:06.742 --> 29:09.927
Those afflicted,
that are discovered by the workers

29:09.928 --> 29:14.385
are quickly taken away and dumped
far away from the colony.

29:15.977 --> 29:20.838
It seems extreme,
but this is the reason why.

29:22.388 --> 29:25.232
Like something out of science fiction

29:25.382 --> 29:31.050
the fruiting body of the cordyceps
erupts from the ant's head.

29:45.613 --> 29:48.118
It can take three weeks to grow

29:48.480 --> 29:53.129
and when finished,
the deadly spores will burst from it's tip

29:53.362 --> 29:58.840
then, any ant in the vicinity
will be in serious risk of death.

30:01.132 --> 30:05.780
The fungus is so virulent,
it can wipe out whole colonies of ants

30:06.206 --> 30:10.176
and it's not just ants
that fall victim to this killer.

30:12.298 --> 30:17.075
There are literally thousands
of different types of cordyceps fungi

30:17.224 --> 30:23.316
and remarkably, each specializes
on just one species

30:59.087 --> 31:04.075
but these attacks do have a positive effect
on the jungle's diversity.

31:04.353 --> 31:10.954
Since parasites like these stop any one group
of animal getting the upper hand.

31:11.442 --> 31:16.984
The more numerous a species becomes,
the more likely it'll be attacked by it's nemesis

31:17.111 --> 31:19.658
a cordyceps fungus.

31:43.563 --> 31:49.527
With so much competition,
jungles have become the home of the specialist.

31:49.761 --> 31:55.026
Now this animal, in the island of Borneo,
is one of the most unusual.

31:55.769 --> 32:00.992
It's a colugo, or flying lemur,
though this is something of a misnomer

32:00.993 --> 32:05.089
as it doesn't actually fly
and it certainly isn't a lemur

32:05.259 --> 32:10.376
in fact nobody's quite sure
who it's closest relative is.

32:29.926 --> 32:33.875
The colugo depends on a diet of young leaves

32:34.023 --> 32:38.716
and to find enough of them,
it must move from tree to tree.

32:40.265 --> 32:46.910
The leaves are not very nutritious, but then,
getting around doesn't use much energy.

32:52.746 --> 32:57.672
In a single night, a colugo might have to
travel as far as two miles

32:57.736 --> 33:03.510
but that task is made easier
by it's superior gliding skills.

33:35.458 --> 33:40.149
The secret of success
in the competitive jungle is specializing

33:40.277 --> 33:44.777
and this has led to the evolution
of some very intimate relationships

33:44.778 --> 33:48.237
between plants and animals.

33:49.108 --> 33:53.524
These are pitcher plants
also from Borneo.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.652
Adapted to living in very low nutrient soils

34:02.842 --> 34:08.213
the pitcher plant gets most of it's nourishment
from insects lured to nectar glands

34:08.382 --> 34:11.185
on the underside of the lids.

34:12.331 --> 34:18.743
Once onboard, the waxy sides of the pitcher
ensure there's little chance of escape.

34:22.011 --> 34:25.831
Most slip to a watery grave.

34:33.304 --> 34:37.635
At the bottom of the pitcher
glands secrete enzymes

34:37.762 --> 34:42.730
which help to digest the corpses,
so feeding the plant.

34:43.641 --> 34:47.889
But not all visitors have a fatal attraction
to the pitchers.

34:49.034 --> 34:56.826
The red crab spider spends it's entire life
in the pitchers, hanging on with threads of silk.

35:05.743 --> 35:11.984
Instead of building a web, it relies on
the water filled pitcher to trap it's food.

35:14.616 --> 35:19.456
When an ant falls in,
the spider simply waits for it to drown

35:19.626 --> 35:24.148
and then abseils down for a spot of fishing.

35:30.878 --> 35:35.208
Alive, this ant would be far too dangerous
for the spider to tackle

35:35.336 --> 35:41.471
so, using the pitchers as traps,
means it can get bigger meals

35:43.276 --> 35:46.418
and the spider doesn't rob the pitcher
of everything.

35:46.566 --> 35:50.431
The digested remains of it's booty
will end up in the water

35:50.579 --> 35:54.081
providing instant food for the plant.

35:58.221 --> 36:02.849
Other food, like mosquito larvae,
seems to be out of reach

36:02.933 --> 36:06.118
but the spider has another sup rising trick.

36:06.394 --> 36:09.643
By taking it's own air supply
trapped in a bubble

36:09.770 --> 36:14.950
the crab spider can actually dive
to the very bottom of the pitcher.

36:18.091 --> 36:25.225
Once the prey is captured, the spider
hauls itself back up it's silken safety line.

36:32.421 --> 36:38.195
The pitcher is a one stop shop for this spider,
but it's not alone.

36:38.535 --> 36:44.543
In the jungle there's competition for everything,
even a small water filled pitcher plant.

37:00.740 --> 37:05.623
Such specialists create
the jungle's remarkable diversity

37:06.048 --> 37:09.338
but finding enough food to survive
is so challenging

37:09.445 --> 37:12.608
that most animals living here tend to be small

37:12.883 --> 37:15.367
though there are exceptions.

37:23.138 --> 37:26.641
This is the Congo in Africa.

37:26.895 --> 37:32.562
It's a vast wilderness
and the least explored of all jungles.

37:34.962 --> 37:40.991
From up here the forest looks similar to the ones
that grow in the Amazon or Southeast Asia.

37:41.585 --> 37:46.064
but down below
there are some unexpected sights.

38:03.939 --> 38:09.055
Crisscrossing this forest,
are countless miles of highways

38:09.204 --> 38:12.770
and they were made by something big.

38:22.132 --> 38:27.164
Forest elephants roam great distances
in their search for food

38:27.546 --> 38:32.769
but to survive, they must emerge
from the gloom of the forest.

38:34.296 --> 38:40.814
And clearings like this one,
are a magnet for elephants from far and wide.

39:36.796 --> 39:42.379
These elephants live in much smaller groups
than their savanna cousins.

39:42.930 --> 39:48.875
This might be the first time that one group
will have seen another for a month.

39:58.386 --> 40:05.625
For the adult males it's a welcome break
in an otherwise largely solitary existence

40:13.692 --> 40:17.768
and they're not the only animals
attracted to the clearing.

40:20.336 --> 40:26.026
Forest buffaloes and red river hogs
are also regular visitors

40:26.430 --> 40:31.907
as are bongos, which are very difficult to see
outside these clearings.

40:32.459 --> 40:38.488
All these large forest animals have come here
to collect an essential element of their diet

40:38.658 --> 40:41.652
that lies buried beneath the mud.

40:46.364 --> 40:51.459
And the elephant's trunk
is the perfect tool for reaching it.

41:05.619 --> 41:07.084
To get what they seek

41:07.085 --> 41:12.646
the prospecting elephants must first
blow away the covering layer of silt.

41:34.787 --> 41:37.717
Satisfaction at last.

41:42.706 --> 41:45.741
They're collecting
a particular kind of clay

41:45.869 --> 41:50.178
that contains vital minerals
scarce in their natural diet.

41:50.476 --> 41:56.739
It may be mud, but there's just nothing
quite like it for enriching the blood.

41:57.778 --> 42:04.508
The clay also helps to absorb the toxins
found in many leaves that the elephants eat.

42:10.112 --> 42:13.104
There are other benefits to coming here.

42:13.932 --> 42:17.202
These clearings are the only places
where the forest elephants

42:17.203 --> 42:20.111
can get together in such numbers.

42:20.302 --> 42:26.628
When they return to the forest, they will have to go
their separate ways, once more.

42:47.136 --> 42:50.426
If large animals are rare in jungles

42:50.554 --> 42:56.328
then groups of large animals
actually living together, are even rarer.

43:15.073 --> 43:22.121
This posse of hunters is not only formidable,
it's also very large.

43:41.419 --> 43:45.793
In their search for food
chimpanzees move effortlessly

43:45.794 --> 43:48.871
between the forest floor and the canopy.

43:49.040 --> 43:53.223
They're one of the few jungle animals
able to do so.

44:07.849 --> 44:11.926
Figs are a vital part of a chimpanzee's diet

44:12.308 --> 44:16.448
and some just can't seem to get enough of them.

44:26.002 --> 44:30.333
But there's something special
about this stretch of forest in Uganda.

44:30.417 --> 44:33.368
Fruit is actually abundant

44:38.973 --> 44:43.771
and a lot of food supports lots of chimps.

45:00.373 --> 45:04.448
At a hundred and fifty strong,
this community of chimps

45:04.449 --> 45:07.271
is the biggest yet found in Africa.

45:07.441 --> 45:12.919
Their numbers are so large, that they need
a big territory, lots of fig trees

45:13.046 --> 45:15.572
and they're willing to fight for it.

45:24.892 --> 45:31.176
These calls announce the start of a raid
into land controlled by their neighbors.

45:37.460 --> 45:44.571
As they leave their core zone, the patrol
goes silent, occasionally stopping to listen.

45:48.902 --> 45:54.698
Signs of the enemy are detected
and examined closely.

46:08.815 --> 46:13.994
The chimp militia are now
at the very edge of their territory.

46:14.758 --> 46:18.495
All need to be on maximum alert.

46:26.795 --> 46:29.895
Then it's wait and listen.

46:51.399 --> 46:55.582
An unfamiliar chimp call
raises the tension.

46:55.645 --> 47:03.096
It's an uncertain time. The size
of the rival group is as yet unknown.

47:05.621 --> 47:09.337
Not far away the neighbors
are feeding in a fig tree

47:09.676 --> 47:12.988
oblivious to the approaching dangers.

47:14.346 --> 47:18.125
The patrol moves off
with a sense of purpose.

47:18.146 --> 47:22.031
They must remain silent
until they close in on their rivals.

47:34.599 --> 47:36.424
The attack is on.

47:38.993 --> 47:45.000
To intimidate their opponents, the aggressors
scream and drum on buttress roots.

48:05.273 --> 48:08.499
Several males corner an enemy female.

48:08.500 --> 48:13.489
It's a ferocious attack,
and she's lucky to escape with her life.

48:30.789 --> 48:33.634
Others are not so fortunate.

48:39.918 --> 48:44.228
The battle won,
a grizzly scene unfolds.

48:45.120 --> 48:48.368
An enemy youngster
has been caught and killed.

48:48.623 --> 48:54.227
The carcass is shared between
members of the group, and eaten.

48:57.497 --> 49:02.741
Killing a competitor makes sense
if you want to protect your food supply

49:05.945 --> 49:11.147
but exactly why they cannibalize
the dead chimp, is not fully understood.

49:12.229 --> 49:17.197
It may simply be a chance
for some extra protein.

49:28.703 --> 49:32.885
Teamwork has brought this
group of chimps great success

49:33.076 --> 49:37.003
but they'll soon reach
the limits of their power.

49:37.810 --> 49:44.922
The competition for resources ensures
that no one species dominates the jungle.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.600
The rainforest's great diversity
has come at a cost.

49:55.790 --> 49:59.951
It has made them the most finely balanced
ecosystems in the world

50:00.142 --> 50:05.173
only too easily upset and destroyed
by that other great ape

50:05.428 --> 50:08.287
the chimpanzee's closest relative

50:08.626 --> 50:12.044
Ourselves.
