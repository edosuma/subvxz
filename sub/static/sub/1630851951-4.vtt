is I'm gonna make you put

12:02.656 --> 12:04.758
your clothes on, we're gonna
take you outside,

12:04.858 --> 12:06.526

boards into half.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.262
How 'bout we start with that?

12:09.363 --> 12:11.064

gonna yell, remember?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.471

- Wait.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.406
We're not yelling.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.274
- How in the hell
are you tired?

12:21.375 --> 12:23.543
When I was your age, I used
to wake up at 1 o'clock

12:23.643 --> 12:25.345
in the morning just to go
to work.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.346
Is that better?
- Yeah, that's--

12:26.446 --> 12:27.781
that was good.

weren't gonna build themselves.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.985
- Oh.

12:32.085 --> 12:36.056
- Look, Grandpa taught me
the value of hard work, okay?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.125
I mean, when I was young,
we mowed the lawns,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.360
we painted the fences.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.329
I mean, he even had me next door

12:42.429 --> 12:44.531
sweeping up the lady's front
porch.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.299
- Well, that wasn't really
a life lesson.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.069
I had you sweeping her front
porch so I could spend time

12:49.169 --> 12:50.737
on her back porch.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.573
- Okay, why did you raise
my dad anyway?

12:53.674 --> 12:55.108
- Well, my dad was a loser.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.443
He stepped out on me.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.979
My mom had three jobs
and six kids.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.249
And old Vinny here
stepped in.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.684
- Well, where's your dad
now?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.385
- I ain't seen him
since I was six.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.720
- Sounds whack.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.221
- Well, it wasn't really
all his fault.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.223
You know, I had his dad
at a young age,

13:10.257 --> 13:12.826
so I didn't do a good job
of raising him.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.229
You know what? See, it's
the old head's job

13:16.263 --> 13:19.866
to give you young bucks
the tool to be successful with.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.702
- Yeah.
And you know what, son?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.770
Um, I'm sorry, man.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.639
I'm sorry for yelling at you
the way I did

13:25.739 --> 13:26.940
and taking away your games.

That just wasn't the right
way to handle this, okay?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.778
- Look, I'm sorry for
losing the stuff

13:31.878 --> 13:32.846
that you bought me.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.348

17:59.880 --> 18:01.314
- Okay. [laughs]

18:01.415 --> 18:04.685
- That's why I'm gonna have
a very difficult decision

18:04.785 --> 18:06.720
to make.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.522
- Well, we'll give you
some privacy.

18:08.622 --> 18:10.457
And God bless ya.
- Mm-hmm.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.592
[laughs]

18:12.693 --> 18:15.028
- Can I get my board?
I need my board. Thank you.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.930
- With your--with your
autograph, honey.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.899
Let me see what she signed
for ya. What she sign?

18:18.999 --> 18:20.267
- I don't know why you here.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.902
You're wasting your time.
- I'm--I'm here--

18:22.002 --> 18:23.870
- We'll see.
- No, I'm sorry, I--

18:23.970 --> 18:27.507
Choose me, and we'll be
Romeo and Juliet.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.577
- Wait. Girl, you and me
like Peaches and Herb.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.079
Ashford and Simpson.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.980
Gladys Knight and the Pips.

18:34.081 --> 18:37.050
Whoo-whoo! [laughs]

18:37.217 --> 18:42.322
- I can no longer go down
a romantic path with you,

18:42.422 --> 18:43.323
Reginald.

18:43.423 --> 18:46.827
- In your...face!

18:46.927 --> 18:48.795
In your face!

18:48.895 --> 18:51.965
Think you can outplay
a playa! Huh?

18:52.065 --> 18:54.134
I'm a pimp!

18:54.234 --> 18:56.269
With a sure enough limp!

18:56.370 --> 18:59.873
I'm a playa!
- Excuse me, Vinny.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.942
But I can't see you
either.

19:02.042 --> 19:06.213
- [laughing]

19:06.313 --> 19:08.315
- I prefer to be friends
with both of you.

19:08.415 --> 19:11.385
And if something evolves
out of our friendship,

19:11.485 --> 19:15.555
then we can cross that bridge
if we come to it.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.924
I just hope...

19:18.025 --> 19:22.729
if I hope, that both of you...

19:22.829 --> 19:24.865
can respect my decision.

19:24.965 --> 19:26.199
- This is bullshit.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.534
- ♪

19:29.535 --> 19:30.636
- Now isn't this better?

19:30.737 --> 19:31.971
Having all your games
in one place instead of

19:32.071 --> 19:34.273
having to scrounge around
the house and--

19:34.374 --> 19:36.342
You know I have found one of his
games in the fridge before?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.177
- [laughs]

19:38.277 --> 19:39.312
- Look, I just wanted
some juice,

19:39.412 --> 19:41.047
and I left it in there
on accident.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.715
It's simple mistake.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.450
And, yeah, you're right.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.586
Thanks, Dad, this is
actually a lot better.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.188
Now I just need some shelves
for like my, uh,

19:49.288 --> 19:51.557
underwear and socks and
shirts and stuff.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.526
- I think you already got
one of those, son.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.361
It's called a dresser.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.132
- Speaking of Dad,
seriously,

19:59.232 --> 20:01.634
I think it's time we, um...

20:01.734 --> 20:04.337
look up your dad, maybe
you and him could reconcile.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.674
- [scoffs] Please. I ain't seen
him since I was six. For what?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.609
- Maybe I can get some of
that back child support payment

20:09.709 --> 20:12.311
he owe me, I mean, 'cause I
bought you a lot of stuff, man.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.981
Let's see, I bought you

20:16.849 --> 20:18.184
Malt liquor?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.385
I don't drink no malt liquor.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.020
- The malt liquor wasn't
for you.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.121
It was for me.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.057
Raising you drove me to drink.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.224
Let's see what else I bought
you.

I bought you a football,
bought you a basketball.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.198
Let's see, uh--oh man,
tennis shoes.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.001
Seem like I had to buy you
tennis shoes every other week.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.270
Them big, huge feet was
growing like crazy.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.572
- You got me.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.741
you remember you were seeing
that girl, and I bought you--

20:41.841 --> 20:43.409
I bought you a box of condoms.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.911
- Yeah, I remember that
real well,

20:45.011 --> 20:47.413
'cause there was only one
left in the box.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.148
