WEBVTT

00:06.464 --> 00:08.925
[Pickles] Okay, guys,
that is my cat eye tutorial.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.803
It probably works better
if you're not a dog,

00:11.886 --> 00:14.139
but anyways, like and subscribe.

00:14.222 --> 00:17.517
Oh, and RIP Nelson Mandela
and Paul Walker.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.644
-[icon pops]
-Love you, sassy boys!

00:20.186 --> 00:23.481
I just don't feel like
doing a makeup tutorial today.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.234
-[whirring]
-Dad! I'm shooting a video!

00:26.317 --> 00:27.193
[Franco] Demi!

00:27.444 --> 00:30.030
I really thought me and Buzzy
were built to last,

00:30.113 --> 00:33.408
like Brad and Angelina,
or Gwyneth and Coldplay Man,

00:33.491 --> 00:36.828
or America and its current love affair
with Rebel Wilson.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.290
[sighs] I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking
about my personal life.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.834
I just feel so alone.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.378
-[icon pops]
-Aw! Thank you.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.798
Hey, Pickle Pack!
Gettin' ready for another job interview.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.635
I think I'm just gonna lie
about having experience. Right?

00:52.719 --> 00:56.806
I got the job! I'm a systems analyst?

00:56.890 --> 01:00.393
I got fired my first day
as a systems analyst,

01:00.477 --> 01:04.230
but then I got a job
as an air traffic controller!

01:04.314 --> 01:07.776
I got fired my first day
as an air traffic controller.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.528
But then I got a job as a waitress!

01:10.612 --> 01:13.198
-So, I've been seeing someone.
-[icon pops]

01:13.281 --> 01:17.535
He's a yellow lab,
and he's so handsome and friendly.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.828
[barks and licks]

01:18.912 --> 01:20.872
-Mister asked me to move in with him!
-[icons pop]

01:20.955 --> 01:24.834
-Hi, Mister!
-Oh, are you taking a video? [laughs]

01:24.918 --> 01:28.213
Thank you, queefburglar69,
for that lovely cartoon heart!

01:28.296 --> 01:32.342
Get a load of this cool house,
Pickle Pack! Lights, off. Lights, on!

01:32.425 --> 01:34.803
-[giggles]
-Thank you, Robot House!

01:34.886 --> 01:36.763
Check this out. The Thunder Room.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.891
A place to wait out thunderstorms
and Fourth of July celebrations!

01:39.974 --> 01:41.267
Thunder door, close!

01:41.351 --> 01:44.270
[automated voice] Closing. [clunks]
Thunder Room secure.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.438
Cute!

01:45.980 --> 01:51.069
He got down on one knee and everything!
He was so nervous before he asked!

01:51.152 --> 01:53.404
-Of course I said yes!
-[icons pop]

01:53.488 --> 01:58.701
-I think Mister is still in shock!
-Engaged! That's what we are now!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.745
Ring filter!

02:00.829 --> 02:02.413
So, I guess I liked the play.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.041
I was just surprised at how different
it was from the movie.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.793
I kept waiting for the baseball part.

02:06.876 --> 02:11.256
And so many dysfunctional relationships!
All the cheating and lying!

02:11.339 --> 02:14.676
[sighs] I'm sure glad we're not like that,
right, Mister?

02:14.759 --> 02:17.971
Um, Pickles, would you mind
turning off the livestream?

02:18.054 --> 02:20.807
There's something I need
to discuss with you. Privately.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.310
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.355
-[beeps]
-[sobbing]

02:27.438 --> 02:32.152
-The wedding is off! [crying]
-[icons popping]

02:32.235 --> 02:34.237
[theme music playing]

03:27.624 --> 03:30.376
-[brakes squeak]
-[crickets chirping]

03:31.085 --> 03:32.503
[exhales]

03:33.046 --> 03:34.505
Hi, I'm here to see BoJack.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.841
You're... [hisses] too late.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.552
-What?
-He's... [hisses] gone...

03:39.636 --> 03:41.554
-No!
-...to a party for the night.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.473
Here's the address.
Sorry for all the wincing.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.559
I put too many jalapeÃ±os
on my... [hisses] sandwich.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.269
A party? With alcohol?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.772
No, a lame party, without alcohol.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.023
Uh...

03:52.315 --> 03:55.151
Don't worry. We sent him
with a trained sober companion.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.903
He'll keep him out of trouble.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.824
This is Eduardo.
He's here to keep me out of trouble.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.911
[chuckles] Say, aren't you
one of those fainting goats?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.788
[laughs] Only if I panic.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.206
So, what makes you panic?

04:08.331 --> 04:11.501
Nothing. The whole point is
he doesn't panic. Sober companion.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.044
You know what makes me panic?

04:13.127 --> 04:16.172
Most of the time
I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.632
but sometimes I like to dwell

04:17.715 --> 04:20.635
on the fact that
there will always be invisible walls

04:20.718 --> 04:23.846
between myself and those who claim
to know me.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.476
[chuckles] That sure is nerve-racking,
but the only thing that makes me panic

04:28.559 --> 04:30.812
is the thought
that I might someday drink again.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.565
-A toast to that never happening!
-[whimpers and thuds]

04:34.774 --> 04:36.776
Very helpful. Thank you, Eduardo.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.531
Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr. Peanutbutter
met at a gas station once.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.075
I honestly don't even know
why I got invited to this party.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.243
[Ruthie crying]

04:45.326 --> 04:47.578
You know, I got a few TV ideas myself.

04:47.662 --> 04:52.417
[chuckles] Franco, nobody wants to hear
your time-travelling orthodontist pitch!

04:52.500 --> 04:56.296
Demi, you are lighting a long fuse
on a short stick of dynamite.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.257
Oh, whoop. And a big one at that.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.593
[inhales, exhales]

05:02.677 --> 05:05.680
-Diane! Didn't think I'd see you here!
-[screams]

05:05.763 --> 05:08.474
Could you go tell BoJack to come out
so I can talk to him?

05:08.558 --> 05:11.894
What? I don't have time
for your classic Diane wackiness.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.980
We gotta get these to the balloon room!

05:15.606 --> 05:17.025
-[coos]
-[screams]

05:17.108 --> 05:19.986
-Hey.
-Hey, look who's back in town!

05:20.069 --> 05:22.030
-[groans]
-Wow! Baby! Cute!

05:22.113 --> 05:23.948
-[giggling]
-She's crawling all over the place.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.076
I wasn't gonna bring her out,
but another nanny quit on me.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.536
Carlotta quit, huh?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.538
I assume she resigned in disgrace

05:30.621 --> 05:33.791
for not making good airplane noises
when she feeds Ruthie?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.253
No, she said she felt
she was being watched all day.

05:37.378 --> 05:41.299
Impossible! I'm there around the clock,
observing her every move.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.802
-If she was being watched, I'd know!
-Uh-huh.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.140
Uh, where do these balloons go?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.894
Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.

05:52.977 --> 05:56.356
Pickles' other friend Ilana.
Didn't think I'd see you here.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.650
And then of course, there's always
the looming fear my spleen

05:59.734 --> 06:01.235
could up and re-twist itself.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.446
How are we back in a conversation?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.448
It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea

06:05.531 --> 06:08.368
but the current keeps washing me back
to the same shallow backwater.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.953
-Hey, there you are.
-Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.663
-Never leave my side.
-I have to tell you--

06:12.747 --> 06:16.876
-Okay, everybody get to your places!
-What's happening?

06:16.959 --> 06:20.088
Mr. Peanutbutter's and Pickles'
surprise wedding!

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
Surprise wedding?

06:21.589 --> 06:24.092
The wedding planning
was stressing Mr. Peanutbutter out,

06:24.175 --> 06:27.553
and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.098
And I'm not doing much
except for sitting at home

06:30.181 --> 06:32.433
watching Princess Carolyn's
terrible nannies,

06:32.517 --> 06:35.853
so naturally I thought,
"Ooh! Surprise wedding!"

06:35.978 --> 06:38.231
-Where are they now?
-I got them two tickets

06:38.314 --> 06:39.982
to Angels in the Outfield.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.486
-The movie?
-The play. It's like six hours long.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.530
Do you mean Angels in America?

06:45.655 --> 06:49.117
Whatever it is,
after that feel-good comedy,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.411
they'll be in a great mood for a wedding!

06:51.494 --> 06:53.830
Wow. Okay...

06:54.122 --> 06:56.791
Look, I cannot be here.
Just... I'm moving.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.876
Great, your apartment's a dump.
Where are you moving to?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.003
Uh, not Echo Park. I'll never see you.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.881
-Chicago.
-Chicago? "Chicago" Chicago?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.675
Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway!

07:05.758 --> 07:08.719
-Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
-Why Chicago?

07:08.803 --> 07:11.681
Everybody hide and stay quiet.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.766
[slapping and groaning]

07:14.016 --> 07:18.688
Remember, as soon as the lights go on,
just jump up and yell, "Surprise!"

07:18.938 --> 07:20.648
-Lights, off!
-[lights beep]

07:23.526 --> 07:26.737
Um, Pickles? Would you mind
turning off the livestream?

07:26.821 --> 07:29.615
There's something I need
to discuss with you. Privately.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.577
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

07:32.660 --> 07:34.954
It's not.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.080
-Lights--
-Wait!

07:36.164 --> 07:37.832
Before Robot House assaults us

07:37.915 --> 07:40.960
with the harsh unforgiving glare
of our energy-efficient bulbs,

07:41.043 --> 07:42.336
I need to tell you this.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.963
But it's so dark in here.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.923
What I'm about to confess is so shameful,

07:46.007 --> 07:48.342
I can only admit it
in the cover of shadow.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.386
Don't be silly. Lights, on!

07:50.511 --> 07:52.096
-I cheated on you!
-[man] Surp--!

07:52.180 --> 07:54.098
-[man shushes]
-Did someone just say something?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.766
Don't change the subject!

07:55.933 --> 07:58.895
-[voice breaking] You cheated on me?
-I am so sorry.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.607
-How could you do this?
-It was the worst mistake of my life!

08:02.690 --> 08:05.026
And I once played Twister
with Bryan Singer

08:05.109 --> 08:07.737
at Kevin Spacey's party
for Andy Dick's early parole.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.198
-Ugh!
-I've been in the Thunder Room every night

08:10.281 --> 08:12.283
for months trying to swallow my shame.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.661
But I can't. And I've apparently been
so racked with guilt I left the door open.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.206
-Thunder door, close.
-[automated voice] Closing. [clunks]

08:18.289 --> 08:19.248
Thunder Room secure.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.334
[muffled voice] Help! Please!

08:21.417 --> 08:24.712
Just because you feel guilty,
that doesn't make it okay.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.340
Are you the time I went to see
Lady Gaga in concert

08:27.423 --> 08:28.966
and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?

08:29.050 --> 08:32.345
Because I am hurt,
and I am confused, and I am angry,

08:32.428 --> 08:35.640
and nobody told me there was going to be
an encore, so I just went home and...

08:35.723 --> 08:37.391
-[groans]
-Why am I even talking to you?

08:37.475 --> 08:40.144
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!
-[gasps]

08:42.146 --> 08:45.650
But, honestly,
can Ilana even relate to me anymore?

08:45.733 --> 08:48.277
Since she got that
new Sunday-to-Thursday job

08:48.361 --> 08:51.572
she's turned into a real
See-You-Next-Friday.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.032
I never thought I'd say this,

08:53.115 --> 08:56.911
but sometimes I feel like I prefer
my other friend Ilana.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.540
Sometimes it's just easier to talk
to a person who has nothing else going on.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.667
-What?
-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.087
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.
I'm a Gemini.

09:06.170 --> 09:10.174
No! Think of my family!
They need me to be strong right now.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.676
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.135
He recently confided to me

09:13.219 --> 09:15.972
he feels trapped in a loveless marriage
with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.308
-[laughs awkwardly]
-Well, can you blame her?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.351
Excuse me?

09:20.434 --> 09:22.645
Every time I get trapped
in a conversation with Captain,

09:22.728 --> 09:25.231
I think, "If I was married to this guy,

09:25.314 --> 09:28.693
I would gnaw my own hand off
just to get the ring off my body."

09:28.776 --> 09:30.611
At least no one in my family
has anger issues.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.448
My father has come so far
with his anger management classes!

09:34.532 --> 09:38.703
I'm sorry, but your father is a hot head
with a little pug complex.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.372
-Everyone makes excuses for his outbursts.
-[snarling]

09:41.455 --> 09:42.999
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
-He's not usually like that."
-[shushes]

09:44.750 --> 09:48.254
-Trust me. He's like that.
-How dare you.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.841
And the way your mother provokes him!
I think they get off on it,

09:51.924 --> 09:55.428
and they're making us unwilling
participants in their kinky foreplay.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.597
Ew! Those are my parents!

09:57.805 --> 10:00.224
-And don't even get me started on Greg.
-[shushes]

10:00.308 --> 10:03.102
That guy that I met once
at that gas station!

10:03.269 --> 10:06.522
-Why are you bringing him up?
-I don't know, but he sucks, too!

10:06.606 --> 10:09.025
-Oh.
-There, I got it off my chest.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.152
I know who I need right now.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.112
No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.239
I understand your Pickle Pack
is part of how you process pain.

10:15.406 --> 10:19.368
Wrong, Mister Mister.
The Pack isn't part of anything.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.911
They are everything.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.789
When I stabbed myself in the eye
with a boba straw,

10:23.873 --> 10:27.877
they all sent me photos
of themselves wearing eyepatches.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.046
And when my Grandma Piccolino died,

10:30.129 --> 10:35.760
stickyvicki was the first person
to say "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

10:35.843 --> 10:39.388
My subscribers are with me
through thick and thin.

10:39.472 --> 10:44.477
And they have never strayed. Unsubscribe!

10:44.560 --> 10:47.563
[crying]

10:49.106 --> 10:50.107
[Diane grunts]

10:50.900 --> 10:52.610
-[groans]
-I never thought this would have

10:52.693 --> 10:54.487
so much practical application in my life,

10:54.570 --> 10:57.156
but you could tie some sheets together
and make a rope.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.034
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles, wait!
-[Pickles] No! You stay!

11:00.326 --> 11:02.036
Bedroom lights, on!

11:02.119 --> 11:03.537
-Down!
-[whispers] Go, go, go.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.957
-[crying]
-[BoJack grunts]

11:09.418 --> 11:12.213
-[Diane groans]
-[BoJack grunts]

11:12.296 --> 11:14.674
[crying, groaning]

11:16.133 --> 11:19.553
The wedding is off!

11:19.637 --> 11:21.889
[sobbing]

11:21.972 --> 11:24.266
He cheated on me!

11:24.350 --> 11:28.312
-[wailing]
-[both groaning]

11:28.562 --> 11:31.023
-Freezer, ice.
-[automated voice] Dispensing.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.777
Water filter, filtrate.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.987
-[pouring]
-[Pickles sobbing]

11:37.071 --> 11:39.990
Oh, I have to talk to her! [pants]

11:43.411 --> 11:44.829
[clamoring]

11:44.912 --> 11:47.748
-[man] Go, go, go, go, go!
-Let's hit the bricks and quick.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.210
-Um, Princess Carolyn...
-Oh, fish!

11:51.836 --> 11:58.217
I mean, I've been hurt by guys before.
But this, I just feel so stupid.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.138
-[text pops]
-My God, thank you, not even.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.391
[knocks]
Hi. I know you are quite upset, but--

12:05.474 --> 12:08.477
Are you not listening?
I told you to leave me alone.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.730
-Right, but--
-Oh! You want a makeup tutorial?

12:10.813 --> 12:13.691
Here's a makeup tutorial:
We are never making up!

12:13.774 --> 12:15.735
-Wha--
-Door, slam!

12:15.818 --> 12:20.698
Okay. Here's how to look
like a crying, pugly freak!

12:21.699 --> 12:24.535
[Pickles] So, you're gonna want a mascara
that really runs...

12:24.618 --> 12:26.078
-So, why Chicago?
-What?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.330
What's the draw?
Is it the rampant gun violence?

12:28.414 --> 12:31.834
Or do you just like seeing improv actors
who aren't good enough for LA?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.170
-Or is there a guy?
-Uh...

12:34.253 --> 12:36.464
What's his name, your suitor?
Your gentleman caller?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.883
-Guy.
-Fine. What's your guy's name?

12:38.966 --> 12:42.803
No. Guy is the name of the guy
I'm not moving to Chicago for.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.598
What's the name of the guy
you are moving to Chicago for?

12:45.681 --> 12:46.766
I think we're done here.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.560
[cooing]

12:51.479 --> 12:53.856
-Ruthie.
-This is all your fault.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.816
If you hadn't creeped out
every nanny I hire--

12:55.900 --> 13:00.571
I wouldn't have to monitor them so closely
if you hadn't hired a bunch of quacks!

13:00.654 --> 13:02.239
Ooh! Duck! [grunts]

13:02.323 --> 13:04.158
[Mr. Peanutbutter whimpering]

13:04.366 --> 13:07.661
What's with all this mid-century furniture
so close to the ground?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.582
-No one had to hide in the '50s?
-Close to the ground, that's it!

13:11.665 --> 13:14.001
We've gotta think like a baby!

13:14.084 --> 13:16.170
I'm a baby. I don't have a job.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.798
I love being wrapped up
in soft, red hoodies.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.884
And when I'm feeling low,
I like to get high.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.720
[gasps] Ruthie's a climber!

13:24.804 --> 13:27.765
[panting]

13:27.932 --> 13:29.600
Just as I suspected.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.978
[licks] Fresh drool. It's Ruthie.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.146
Todd!

13:36.273 --> 13:38.275
-[coos]
-[BoJack grunts]

13:38.442 --> 13:42.363
[sighs] So, I obviously can't
marry him, right?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.615
What do you guys think I should do?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.617
-Hey. Give me that.
-[text pops]

13:46.700 --> 13:49.620
"You should make Mr. Peanutbutter
take you to the park,

13:49.703 --> 13:52.832
far away from this mouse."
What mouse?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.208
[groans]

13:54.500 --> 13:55.584
-[text pops]
-Great idea!

13:55.668 --> 13:57.837
-Door, open!
-[both gasp]

13:57.920 --> 13:59.964
-Hey, Mister! Take me to the park!
-[giggling]

14:00.047 --> 14:02.299
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Can do!
-I'll be right down!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.760
Okay, Pickle Pack,
let's pick out an outfit.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.888
What says, "I am going to survive this
because I am strong,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.224
-but you should still feel very bad"?
-Uh...

14:10.307 --> 14:14.562
-Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.
-[giggles]

14:15.354 --> 14:20.484
But what if we go for a walk and he says
all the right things and I forgive him?

14:20.568 --> 14:23.237
I can't make it so easy for him, can I?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.613
Oh, my God.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.409
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.245
Hey, Mister!
Cancel the park and come here.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.789
What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.208
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] On my way, darling!
-Kitty up. [grunts]

14:36.292 --> 14:37.376
-[Ruthie blows]
-[Princess Carolyn sighs]

14:37.459 --> 14:40.337
Bring me my favorite drink.
Exactly the way I like it.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.922
Then we'll talk.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.465
Of course, right away!

14:43.549 --> 14:44.550
[BoJack grunts]

14:45.509 --> 14:47.678
[groans] Of course he'll make
my drink perfect.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.847
Because he's perfect!

14:49.930 --> 14:51.682
I mean, look at him!

14:51.765 --> 14:54.685
And... and... Look at him!

14:54.768 --> 14:57.688
-[BoJack groaning]
-Um... Oh!

14:57.813 --> 15:01.400
And him, as portrayed
in this boardwalk caricature drawing!

15:01.567 --> 15:03.485
I didn't know he liked tennis
and skateboarding.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.905
What else has he been hiding from me?

15:05.988 --> 15:09.825
[sighs] I mean, is it me?
Was I not good enough?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
[text popping]

15:12.202 --> 15:14.622
Yeah, I'm not the problem!

15:14.705 --> 15:18.876
In fact, why am I even in his house?

15:18.959 --> 15:20.753
-[pops]
-I need to pack!

15:22.129 --> 15:27.217
[groans] I'm going
to a fancy-ass hotel.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.594
-And...
-[gasps]

15:28.677 --> 15:33.807
I'm gonna try to get my room comped
in exchange for social media promotion!

15:33.891 --> 15:35.309
And then they'll say no.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.062
And then I'll pay for the room
and drag them online.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.065
Hate to leave you hanging. [grunts]

15:41.899 --> 15:43.025
-[coos]
-Yeah.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.112
Wait a minute! Why should I leave?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.031
-He's the one who cheated!
-[exhales]

15:49.573 --> 15:51.951
[grunting]

15:52.743 --> 15:55.996
He can live in the dog park
for all I care!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.581
[text popping]

15:57.665 --> 16:00.250
-[rustling]
-[Princess Carolyn groans]

16:00.542 --> 16:02.878
But then, why do I want him to stay?

16:03.253 --> 16:06.256
-I'm so confused.
-[text pops]

16:06.590 --> 16:09.843
Good call, t_chavez!

16:09.927 --> 16:12.805
-[notification dings]
-You're welcome. Oh, no!

16:12.888 --> 16:14.056
-[sighs]
-Phew!

16:24.024 --> 16:26.944
Boba Maker. Uh... boba make?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.363
[whirs and squirts]

16:29.822 --> 16:31.782
[automated voice]
Would you like whipped cream?

16:31.865 --> 16:36.120
Uh...

16:36.870 --> 16:38.914
Hey, so, uh, sobriety. How is it?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.749
[scoffs] Impossible.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.798
Uh...

16:48.590 --> 16:51.760
There's no clear path to the exit.
You can wait it out, I'm doing the window.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.138
It's not because of me
that you're moving to Chicago?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.140
No. I need to go.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.143
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles? Precious?
Possible point of complexity...

16:59.226 --> 17:00.936
Son of a bitch.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.979
[grunting]

17:02.062 --> 17:04.148
...I know your favorite drink is boba,

17:04.231 --> 17:06.025
but just the other day, you said,

17:06.108 --> 17:08.402
"Whipped cream
is the best thing in the world"

17:08.485 --> 17:10.946
immediately followed by,
and this is a direct quote,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.907
"So, keep it as far away
from me as possible!"

17:13.991 --> 17:15.868
I just wanted to circle back.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.622
[music playing over earbuds]

17:20.706 --> 17:22.041
Yeah.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.167
Don't get me wrong,

17:23.250 --> 17:26.545
I love the challenge of trying
to square two irreconcilable positions.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.006
-Where's the baby? There's the baby!
-[giggling]

17:29.339 --> 17:31.800
Where's the baby?
[gasps] Shit! Where's the baby?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.428
[glass shatters]

17:34.511 --> 17:37.056
Bang-crash, you say! I hear the note.

17:37.139 --> 17:41.560
I'll be right back with your drink
prepared exactly the way you want it!

17:42.686 --> 17:44.021
[Princess Carolyn grunts]

17:46.940 --> 17:47.816
Here.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.070
-You know how in AA they give you chips?
-But no salsa?

17:51.403 --> 17:52.362
Using that.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.490
But they're a big deal, the chips.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.743
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking
they're more important than they are,

17:57.826 --> 17:59.995
but when I got my two-month chip...

18:01.246 --> 18:04.500
I thought, "I wish Diane could see this."

18:04.917 --> 18:07.252
I see it. It's amazing.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.797
It would not be improved by salsa.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
[Pickles] Door, open!

18:12.257 --> 18:17.137
[both gasp, grunting]

18:17.221 --> 18:18.347
No! No!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.892
-[BoJack scoffs]
-[Pickles humming]

18:21.975 --> 18:23.060
Hmm.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.024
Sunshine, I have your boba.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
[Pickles] No whipped cream, I hope.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.111
Of course not.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.946
You always know how I like it.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.156
Is there any chance we could talk IRL?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.033
Intimately, rigorously, lengthily?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.535
[inhales, exhales]

18:40.285 --> 18:44.206
You know, what's funny
is now I actually want the whipped cream.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.126
Well, good news, because, uh...

18:47.793 --> 18:50.712
-Hmm...
-I don't want to be mad at you.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.713
That's great!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.924
-No, it's not--
-I know I caused you pain,

18:54.007 --> 18:57.344
but we can get through this.
I still wanna marry you.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.013
Do you still want to marry me?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.268
Promise me you'll never lie to me again?

19:04.351 --> 19:05.769
I promise.

19:05.894 --> 19:11.275
Then I guess we could put it behind us
if it just happened the one time.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.528
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.738
Comprised of two separate instances.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.408
-What?
-But the spirit of it was once.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.786
Well, at least you told me right away.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.706
-It happened a few months ago.
-What?

19:25.789 --> 19:29.209
-But I'm being honest with you now!
-Okay.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.754
-At least it wasn't with someone I know.
-It was Diane.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.508
Diane, the nice lady
from the chew toy store?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.051
Diane, my ex-wife?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.429
That's so much worse!

19:40.637 --> 19:43.432
You are a bad dog!

19:43.515 --> 19:47.936
-No. No. No!
-[shrieks]

19:48.020 --> 19:50.772
-[shattering]
-[Mr. Peanutbutter groans]

19:50.856 --> 19:55.277
[Pickles crying]

19:57.779 --> 20:00.782
[crying continues]

20:02.701 --> 20:06.079
Come on, Eduardo. Hold it together.
You're not just a fainting goat.

20:06.163 --> 20:11.084
You're a trained sober companion.
Just do what the sign says.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.047
No! [thuds]

20:15.631 --> 20:19.843
-[music playing over earbuds]
-[sighs]

20:19.927 --> 20:22.012
[whirring]

20:22.095 --> 20:24.181
-Vacuum, stop.
-[automated voice] Stopping.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.063
Coin sorter, sort. [tinkling]

20:31.146 --> 20:34.233
Oh, Coin Sorter,
I'd love to toss my problems in a tray

20:34.316 --> 20:37.736
and say, "Here, sort these out."
I know it doesn't work that way,

20:37.819 --> 20:42.199
but if only this smart house
could give some advice to this stupid dog.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.826
-[BoJack imitates robot] Go to her.
-Coin Sorter?

20:44.993 --> 20:47.579
Go to Pickles. Go now.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.458
I don't know, Coin Sorter.
I've already screwed everything up so bad.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.835
I should sit here
and wait for her to come to me.

20:54.002 --> 20:57.297
No. You go to her. Leave this room.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.092
-Okay.
-[imitates robot] But don't talk so much!

21:00.175 --> 21:04.888
-What?
-It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.057
Thermostat, I should have known.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.226
I can always count on you
to cool things down

21:09.309 --> 21:10.894
when they get too heated.
You were saying?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.230
Sometimes you try to fix problems

21:13.313 --> 21:16.984
or make them go away,
which comes off as dismissive.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.487
If you want to solve this, listen.
Really hear her.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.364
Beep-boop. Seventy-two degrees.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.824
Okay.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.829
[both sigh, grunt]

21:31.039 --> 21:33.542
[normal voice] Is this mess
why you're moving to Chicago?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.335
[normal voice] I told you,
I'm moving for me.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.336
I get it.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.839
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.384
-I mean... I don't know.
-You seem okay.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.304
But the reason I had to tell you
I was leaving,

21:45.387 --> 21:48.015
the reason I came
to my ex-husband's house,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.851
was because I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.394
I need to hear you say it.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.939
I can't leave if I don't know
you're going to be okay, BoJack.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.691
-I'll be okay.
-Promise?

21:57.774 --> 21:59.776
Because if something happens,
and I'm in Chicago--

21:59.860 --> 22:03.155
That's not a friendship,
that's a hostage situation.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.574
Go to Chicago. I'll be fine.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.367
Thank you.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.953
-[Todd gasps]
-[balloons popping]

22:10.037 --> 22:11.580
-Hey!
-Ruthie?

22:12.664 --> 22:14.458
Ruthie! [groans]

22:14.541 --> 22:16.543
-[both grunting]
-[balloons popping]

22:21.798 --> 22:23.800
-There you are!
-[giggling]

22:23.884 --> 22:28.263
Let's get you away
from these delightful choking hazards!

22:28.347 --> 22:30.807
You know, Todd, you have a knack for this.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.476
Would you wanna be her nanny?

22:32.559 --> 22:35.062
I do know her routine
and all of her favorite foods

22:35.145 --> 22:37.814
and how to do funny voices
for bedtime stories,

22:37.898 --> 22:41.526
unlike Carlotta who does voices
like Cameron Diaz

22:41.610 --> 22:44.363
"did a voice" for the Shrek movies.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.616
-[giggles]
-So, that's a yes then?

22:47.699 --> 22:50.869
[music playing over earbuds]

22:51.620 --> 22:53.038
[sighs]

22:54.081 --> 22:56.124
I don't want to be mad at you.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.796
It sucks that I have to be mad at you.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.465
This should be
the happiest time of my life,

23:03.548 --> 23:08.512
but now because you did something stupid,
I have to feel bad.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.055
That's not fair.

23:10.806 --> 23:15.769
And I still love you and...
[sighs] I still wanna marry you.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.480
But you can't do things
that hurt me like that.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.148
It's not okay.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.527
And if we just go back
to the way things were before

23:23.610 --> 23:27.280
and pretend nothing happened,
I'm gonna feel stupid.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.241
We can't just go back.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.451
How can we make this right?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.454
Don't just stand there!
I'm talking to you.

23:34.538 --> 23:39.000
I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.
I want you to trust me.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.003
I wanna make us even somehow.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.506
Even? The only logical way to be even

23:44.589 --> 23:47.050
would be if I got to sleep
with somebody else.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.927
Okay. If that's what needs to happen.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.388
-Really?
-Yeah, we just have to think who--

23:51.471 --> 23:53.140
Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.058
Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.768
No, you don't even know him.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.520
Knowing is what hurts the most.

23:58.603 --> 24:02.816
What if I sleep with Buzzy and Tyler
from Soul Cycle?

24:02.899 --> 24:06.570
-Two people?
-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.779
If we put our heads together,

24:07.863 --> 24:10.991
I know we'll find the perfect guy
for you to cheat on me with

24:11.074 --> 24:12.284
that makes it totally even,

24:12.367 --> 24:15.245
so things can go back to normal
and we can get married.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.956
-Thank you.
-[doorbell rings]

24:18.623 --> 24:21.293
-Hey, guys.
-Diane?

24:21.376 --> 24:24.880
I'm just here to randomly apologize
for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.133
It was a big mistake and it was my fault
and it will never happen again.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.801
Also, I think I left my wallet here

24:29.885 --> 24:32.012
when I came to your party
a year and a half ago.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.639
If you find it, probably under the bed
in the master suite,

24:34.723 --> 24:37.601
could you mail it to me?
I live in Chicago now. Thanks.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.228
This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.
He's just keeping me sober.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.147
Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.566
-And here's your boba.
-Thank you.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.694
-Odd.
-[phone buzzing]

24:47.777 --> 24:51.114
-Oh, my parents are calling.
-Fun! Put 'em on speaker!

24:51.781 --> 24:58.622
âª Back in the 90s
I was in a very famous TV show âª

25:00.624 --> 25:02.876
-âª I'm BoJack the Horseman âª
-âª BoJack âª

25:02.959 --> 25:07.380
âª BoJack the Horseman
Don't act like you don't know âª

25:10.008 --> 25:14.304
âª And I'm trying to hold on to my past âª

25:14.387 --> 25:18.975
âª It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last âª

25:19.184 --> 25:22.729
âª I guess I'm just trying
To make you understand âª

25:22.812 --> 25:26.983
âª That I'm more horse than a man âª

25:27.192 --> 25:32.822
âª Or I'm more man than a horse âª
-âª BoJack! âª
