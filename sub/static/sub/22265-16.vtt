such a jerk, right, Daphne?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.189
Not really.

Dude, this is not the way
things went down in the episode.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.703
I remember everything
that happened in Scooby-D00.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.547
And no one ever got stabbed in the back

16:07.640 --> 16:09.062

in a pool of their own blood.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.906
Yeah, yeah, okay, um...

16:12.000 --> 16:15.822
So, if that guy can die for real
in this cartoon,

16:16.120 --> 16:17.439

for what's going on.

to collect an inheritance?

What would a ghost need with money?

there's no such thing as ghosts.

That was the coolest thing
that's ever happened to me.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.741
And that includes the Cartwright twins.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.861
What did you do
with the Cartwright twins?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.497
Oh! (LAUGHS)

37:23.200 --> 37:24.189
I'll be right back.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.509
I don't think I wanna know.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.417
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.789
Time to go, kid.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.703
What about the bad man?

38:15.840 --> 38:19.219
Don't worry about him,
we'll take care of him, all right?

38:57.360 --> 38:58.349
Phew!

39:09.120 --> 39:10.439
You sure about this?

39:10.520 --> 39:13.705
Look, you're getting
this place for a steal,

39:17.240 --> 39:19.424
but I'm too old for this crap.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.705
Ah! If you say so.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.819
Just two more signatures, and...

39:28.760 --> 39:29.829
(DOOR OPENS)

39:29.920 --> 39:30.909
Not so fast.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.537
Is that an ascot?

39:38.920 --> 39:41.582
Yes, yes, it is.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.705
Uh, what are you guys doing here?

39:46.240 --> 39:48.105
Hey, Alan, your friend here,

39:48.200 --> 39:49.986
he's been driving people
off of their property,

39:50.080 --> 39:51.399
so he could buy it on the Cheap.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.699
And he's been using
his own personal ghost to do it.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.062
You see, he ’0' plant a haunted object;
then let the ghost go to work.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.859
DEA/V:
And it would possess something
hlcge
big dinosaur,

40:07.240 --> 40:09.185
or a perfectly beautiful TV.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.309
And scare people so much,
that they'd be desperate to sell.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.269
When we got nosey...

40:16.360 --> 40:18.737
I think we should probably
keep doing some digging.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.629
Everything, all right?

40:20.720 --> 40:21.709
Where are you gonna put this?

40:21.800 --> 40:23.222
He sicced his pet ghost on us.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.584
- Take it easy.
- SAM: What?

40:25.680 --> 40:27.625
She's delicate, all right. I'll lead.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.745
She? She, really she?

40:33.600 --> 40:37.377
But now, that spirit is freed.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.347
(CHUCKLES)

40:42.480 --> 40:44.698
They're lying. They're...

40:46.160 --> 40:47.661
You think anyone's
going to believe that?

40:48.840 --> 40:51.024
No, but that's why
we hacked your financials.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.303
Turns out you're not so big
on paying your taxes, are ya?

40:55.040 --> 40:56.667
Good enough for Capone,
good enough for you.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.468

OFFICER: Come on.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.423
SAM: Huh!

41:10.640 --> 41:11.743
Velma was right.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.159
It was a shady
real estate developer, after all.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.549
It's not fair.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.940
I would have gotten away with it
if it wasn't for those meddling kids.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.263
Whoo!

41:21.560 --> 41:23.699
He said it. He said the line.

Scooby-dooby-doo!

41:32.800 --> 41:33.869
What are you doing?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.457
Well, I mean,
at the end of every mystery,

41:35.560 --> 41:37.346
Scooby looks into the camera
and he says--

41:37.560 --> 41:40.620
Dean, you're not a talking dog.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.464
I know that. I...

41:46.360 --> 41:47.384
Yeah.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.640
No, but come on, I do look cool
in the ascot, right?

41:52.840 --> 41:56.788
No? Guys? Come on, guys.
Look, red is my color.
