WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:04.004
HEY. SO YOU KNOW
MARCY AT WORK?

00:04.004 --> 00:06.177
LITTLE TOO OLD FOR PIGTAILS,
BUT GO AHEAD.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.678
YOU CAN'T BE TOO OLD
FOR PIGTAILS.

00:07.678 --> 00:09.510
MY GRANDMA HAD 'EM
WHEN SHE WAS 96,

00:09.510 --> 00:11.142
AND SHE WAS ADORABLE.

00:11.142 --> 00:13.144
ANYWAY, THINKING ABOUT
CUTTING OUT EARLY ON FRIDAY

00:13.144 --> 00:15.346
AND TAKING MARCY
TO GO SEE THE LEAVES CHANGE.

00:15.346 --> 00:18.219
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
MR. DONOHUE'S IN TOWN THIS WEEK.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.321
OOH, BIG BOSS MAN COMETH.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.054
LOOK OUT-ETH
SO THOU DOESN'T GET FIRED-ETH

00:23.054 --> 00:25.396
FOR STEALING
OFFICE SUPPLIES-ETH.

00:25.396 --> 00:27.428
WAIT, IS IT "SUPPLY-ETH"
OR "SUPPLIES-ETH"?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.330
NO, I HAD IT.
IT'S "SUPPLIES-ETH."

00:29.330 --> 00:31.402
LOOK, HE'S ONLY IN TOWN
A COUPLE OF DAYS A MONTH,

00:31.402 --> 00:33.434
SO WE JUST GOTTA LAY LOW
AND DO OUR JOBS,

00:33.434 --> 00:34.705
AND IF YOU RUN INTO HIM,

00:34.705 --> 00:38.139
MAKE HIM FEEL SUPERIOR
BY ASKING FOR HIS HELP.

00:40.211 --> 00:43.174
(grunts) OHH, WELL.

00:43.174 --> 00:45.045
I GUESS
NO JELLY FOR ME TODAY.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.148
HOLD ON, SON.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.680
THE TRICK TO
OPENING THESE THINGS...
(pop)

00:49.680 --> 00:52.083
IS TO BE STRONG.

00:52.083 --> 00:56.187
I LIKE TO GIVE MR. DONOHUE
SCONES. HE LOVES SCONES.

00:56.187 --> 00:58.429
ONE MIGHT SAY
HE'S A TOTALSCONER.

00:58.429 --> 00:59.730
EW, I HATE SCONES.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.462
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A MOUTHFUL OF FLOUR

01:01.462 --> 01:03.234
WITH, LIKE,
ONE RAISIN IN IT.

01:03.234 --> 01:06.167
HEY, ENGLAND,
WHY SO STINGY WITH THE FRUIT?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.838
I HAVE GRANT
MAKE THEM FOR ME.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.770
THAT GUY BAKES
A SCONE SO DELICIOUS,

01:09.770 --> 01:12.273
IT WOULD MAKE A DOUGHNUT GO HOME
AND BLOW ITS BRAINS OUT.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.146
MMM. JELLY AND GLAZE
SPATTERED EVERYWHERE.

01:15.146 --> 01:18.579
GOD, I'D LOVE TO BE THE COP
TO WALK IN ON THAT CRIME SCENE.

01:18.579 --> 01:25.686
(growls)

01:25.686 --> 01:27.618
YEAH.
MORNING, MR. DONOHUE.

01:27.618 --> 01:29.089
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU
BACK IN TOWN, SIR.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.221
I BROUGHT YOU SOME SCONES.

01:30.221 --> 01:32.193
OH, GREAT.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.794
FREAK SHOW.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.528
GOOD MORNING, WILL KEEN.

01:37.528 --> 01:38.769
OH. HI, HENRY.

01:38.769 --> 01:42.233
SO MY MOTHER MOVED IN.
SHE'S VERY INTENSE...

01:42.233 --> 01:44.104
AND HIGHLY UNCOOPERATIVE
IN THE TUB.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.336
THAT'S OKAY,
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW

01:45.336 --> 01:47.178
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
TO KEEP YOUR MOTHER CLEAN.

01:47.178 --> 01:48.739
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
YEAH.

01:48.739 --> 01:52.283
THEN SHE MAKES ME AN OMELET,
AND EVERYTHING'S OKAY AGAIN.

01:52.283 --> 01:55.186
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU TWO
FOUND A SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.187
MM.

01:56.187 --> 01:57.188
HEY, WILL.

01:57.188 --> 01:58.749
OW.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.221
THAT'S WEIRD.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.793
STOP IT. I'M SORE.

02:02.793 --> 02:05.526
I TOOK A SPIN CLASS
AT THE GYM THIS MORNING,

02:05.526 --> 02:07.398
AND THE TRAINER
WAS SUCH A MANIAC.

02:07.398 --> 02:11.162
HE WAS ALL UP IN MY FACE.
HE WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE A SLACKER.

02:11.162 --> 02:12.703
"I HAVE NO TOLERANCE
FOR SLACKERS,

02:12.703 --> 02:16.407
SO KEEP UP OR GET OUT.
AND YOUR CALVES ARE SMALL."

02:16.407 --> 02:19.210
OHH. MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO TO A DIFFERENT CLASS.

02:19.210 --> 02:22.273
EH. I DESERVE IT. I'M FAT.

02:22.273 --> 02:23.474
OH.

02:23.474 --> 02:24.775
(groaning)

02:24.775 --> 02:26.577
KEEN.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.479
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU HANDLED THAT CRAIG IDIOT

02:28.479 --> 02:30.281
IN THE BREAK ROOM
THIS MORNING--

02:30.281 --> 02:32.283
YELLING AT HIM,
MOCKING HIS CALVES.

02:32.283 --> 02:34.555
SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.926
RIGHT.

02:35.926 --> 02:38.229
RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.
(chuckles)

02:38.229 --> 02:40.361
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
MANAGEMENT POTENTIAL,

02:40.361 --> 02:42.793
SO I'M GIVING YOU
A PROMOTION.

02:42.793 --> 02:45.866
A PROMOTION? WOW.
(laughs)

02:45.866 --> 02:49.240
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.801
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
WITH THE COMPANY FIVE YEARS,

02:50.801 --> 02:52.573
AND I'VE FELT--
YEAH, WELL, DON'T WRITE
AN OPERA ABOUT IT.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.575
WE CAN WORK OUT
THE DETAILS LATER

02:54.575 --> 02:56.577
ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE MONEY
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.950
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ANY MORE MONEY,

02:59.950 --> 03:01.852
SO NOW THAT'S WORKED OUT.

03:01.852 --> 03:03.684
WELL, I-I GUESS
MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.916
BUT I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE PART
OF THE TEAM THAT HAS BEEN--

03:05.916 --> 03:08.759
LOOK HOW MUCH YOU TALK.
GOOD FOR YOU.

03:10.721 --> 03:13.494
THAT WAS THE WORST TRIP
TO THE MALL EVER.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.526
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:15.526 --> 03:16.597
WE GOT EVERYTHING DONE,

03:16.597 --> 03:17.898
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO
BACKTRACK ONCE,

03:17.898 --> 03:19.199
AND WE GOT OUR BLOOD PRESSURE
TAKEN FOR FREE.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.201
IT WAS FUNNY WHEN UNCLE KENNY

03:21.201 --> 03:22.803
GOT HIS ARM TRAPPED
IN THE MACHINE.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.277
(imitates Kenny) "HELP!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE THIS WAY!"

03:26.277 --> 03:28.279
(normal voice) CLASSIC.

03:28.279 --> 03:29.280
YEAH.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.711
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.383
YOU USED TO BE SO MUCH FUN.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.685
YOU DIDN'T TRY ON
A SINGLE WIG TODAY.

03:34.685 --> 03:35.916
(high-pitched voice,
British accent) I'M THE QUEEN

03:35.916 --> 03:39.520
OF ENGLAND.
OFF WITH YOUR HEAD!

03:39.520 --> 03:41.252
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!

03:41.252 --> 03:43.254

03:43.254 --> 03:44.695
(normal voice)
I'M DAVID HASSELHOFF.

03:44.695 --> 03:46.357
(imitates elderly man)
OH! I'M GRANDPA!

03:46.357 --> 03:47.858
YOU'RE ALL A DISAPPOINTMENT!

03:47.858 --> 03:49.560
(high-pitched voice)
BOING, BOING, BOING, BOING.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.902
(lisping)
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY ♪

03:51.902 --> 03:55.606
♪ MR. PRESIDENT ♪

03:55.606 --> 03:58.769
(normal voice)
WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW!

03:58.769 --> 04:00.871
(imitates Christopher Walken)
I'M OLD CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.

04:00.871 --> 04:01.972
AND I'M GONE!

04:01.972 --> 04:03.874
NOW I'M YOUNG
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.

04:03.874 --> 04:06.717
(imitates Al Pacino)
AL... PA... CINO.

04:06.717 --> 04:08.819
(Yiddish accent)
GET ME A REUBEN SANDWICH

04:08.819 --> 04:10.421
IMMEDIATELY.

04:10.421 --> 04:11.322
BECAUSE OF YOU,
THEY PUT UP A SIGN

04:11.322 --> 04:13.324
THAT SAID,
"FIVE WIG JOKES PER CUSTOMER."

04:13.324 --> 04:14.785
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
PUT ON THAT OLD LADY WIG,

04:14.785 --> 04:15.856
'CAUSE YOU WERE ALL...

04:15.856 --> 04:16.927
(mocking) "DON'T DO THIS,

04:16.927 --> 04:19.259
"AND DON'T DO THAT,
I'M UPTIGHT,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.692
AND THAT MANNEQUIN DOESN'T
WANT TO DO THAT WITH YOU."

04:21.692 --> 04:23.434
AND THEN
THERE'S THIS DOOFUS

04:23.434 --> 04:25.796
WITH HIS BIG SMILE
AND HIS OWN HAIR.
(door closes)

04:25.796 --> 04:27.738
WHAT'D I DO?
NOTHING, BUDDY.
I'M JUST LASHING OUT.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.440
I GOT A PROMOTION!

04:29.440 --> 04:30.441
REALLY?

04:30.441 --> 04:31.442
(laughs)
OHH.

04:31.442 --> 04:34.004
THAT'S FANTASTIC! OHH!

04:34.004 --> 04:36.307
TAKE THAT, MOM.
MY HUSBANDISA SUCCESS.

04:36.307 --> 04:37.808
I'M NOT GETTING
ANY MORE MONEY.

04:37.808 --> 04:41.412
OH. MY MOM LOVES YOU.

04:41.412 --> 04:44.815
BUT TELL YOUR MOM THE NEW TITLE
DOES COME WITH PERKS.

04:44.815 --> 04:49.890
EXECUTIVES AND THEIR FRIENDS
AND FAMILIES GET ACCESS TO...

04:49.890 --> 04:52.523
THE AVALON CLUB DOWNTOWN.

04:52.523 --> 04:55.526
(gasps)
"THE AVALON CLUB."
OOH, THAT'S POSH.

04:55.526 --> 04:57.928
I HEARD THEY HAVE
BATHROOM ATTENDANTS THERE.

04:57.928 --> 04:59.299
I SHALL BRING
ALL OF MY COMBS

04:59.299 --> 05:01.432
AND DUNK THEM LIBERALLY
INTO THEIR BARBICIDE.

05:05.476 --> 05:09.510
MR. DONOHUE. I WAS JUST
CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS--
GREAT STORY.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.443
SOMEONE IN THIS COMPANY IS GOING
TO LOSE THEIR JOB TODAY, KEEN.

05:12.443 --> 05:14.985
REALLY?
BEFORE YOU DECIDE WHO...
(opens drawer)

05:14.985 --> 05:17.017
COULD YOU HELP ME
OPEN THIS JAR?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.589
CERTAINLY.

05:18.589 --> 05:20.491
(pop)

05:20.491 --> 05:22.052
SO HERE'S THE DEAL--
WHEN I'M IN TOWN,

05:22.052 --> 05:24.455
I LIKE TO MAKE SURE
THAT PEOPLE STAY ON THEIR TOES,

05:24.455 --> 05:26.357
AND NOTHING DOES THAT BETTER
THAN FIRING SOMEONE.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.098
COULDN'T WE JUST
OPEN MORE JARS?

05:28.098 --> 05:29.930
WELL, ONE OF US COULD.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.103
ANYWAY, I WANT TO GET RID OF
THIS CRAIG GRIFFITH CHARACTER,

05:33.103 --> 05:36.036
WITH HIS SCONES
AND HIS HOW-DO-YOU-DO'S,

05:36.036 --> 05:38.409
BUT I CAN'T FIRE HIM
BECAUSE HE'S GAY

05:38.409 --> 05:40.511
AND I DON'T WANT
TO RISK A LAWSUIT.

05:40.511 --> 05:41.872
OH, NO, NO, NO,
CRAIG'S NOT GAY.

05:41.872 --> 05:43.343
WELL, THEN ICANFIRE HIM.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.517
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. NO--OH, WAIT.
DID YOU MEAN "GAY" LIKE "HAPPY"?

05:46.517 --> 05:48.949
BECAUSE I MEANT
THAT CRAIG IS NOT HAPPY.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.782
IN FACT, HE IS ONE SAD,
LITIGIOUS HOMOSEXUAL.

05:51.782 --> 05:53.784
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THOSE PEOPLE.

05:53.784 --> 05:56.457
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING A MAN

05:56.457 --> 05:58.459
AND WANTING TO
TAKE ANOTHER MAN

05:58.459 --> 05:59.960
AND SUE HIM?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.762
THE NEXT PERSON ON MY LIST

06:01.762 --> 06:04.695
IS SOME GUY NAMED,
UH, HENRY TRUNKA.

06:04.695 --> 06:07.037
I'VE HEARD HE'S A WEIRDO,
SO I WANT YOU TO FIRE HIM.

06:07.037 --> 06:08.038
ME?
MM-HMM.

06:08.038 --> 06:09.740
WAIT.
YOU WANTMETO FIRE HIM?

06:09.740 --> 06:12.372
OH, BUT HENRY HAS
ALL THESE PROBLEMS

06:12.372 --> 06:14.705
WITH HIS MOM
AND BATHING HER--

06:14.705 --> 06:16.407
HAVING THIS JOB
IS TOUGH, SON,

06:16.407 --> 06:18.479
BUT IT'S HOW
WE BUY OUR FERRARIS

06:18.479 --> 06:20.751
AND VACATION
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

06:20.751 --> 06:23.053
(chuckles) OR LEASE
OUR MID-SIZED SEDANS

06:23.053 --> 06:26.056
AND VACATION IN THE NORTH
OF CLEVELAND. (chuckles)

06:26.056 --> 06:27.718
I-I HAVE A COUSIN
WHO HAS A CONDO UP THERE.

06:27.718 --> 06:31.562
IT'S, UH, IT'S...
NOT VERY NICE.

06:31.562 --> 06:32.893
CAN HIS ASS.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.926
(sighs)

06:39.800 --> 06:41.432
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,

06:41.432 --> 06:43.604
BUT I'VE SEEN EVERY MOVIE
THAT STARTS WITH THE LETTER "R."

06:43.604 --> 06:44.775
TEST ME.

06:44.775 --> 06:45.776
"RATATOUILLE."

06:45.776 --> 06:46.837
WAIT, NO. I MEANT "B."

06:46.837 --> 06:47.838
"BONNIE AND CLYDE."

06:47.838 --> 06:48.839
MAYBE IT IS "R."

06:48.839 --> 06:50.080
WHAT'S "RATATOUILLE"
ABOUT AGAIN?

06:50.080 --> 06:53.784
YOU CAN'T FLIRT WITH MARCY
ANYMORE. YOU HAVE TO BE GAY NOW.

06:53.784 --> 06:55.145
DUDE, JUST BECAUSE
YOU GOT A PROMOTION

06:55.145 --> 06:56.887
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.649
DONOHUE WANTS TO FIRE YOU.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.721
THE ONLY REASON HE DOESN'T
IS BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU'RE GAY.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.953
HE THINKS I'M GAY?

07:02.953 --> 07:05.726
DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
ALL THE WOMEN I'VE SLEPT WITH?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.798
I WROTE A SONG ABOUT IT,
AND I CAN SING IT FOR HIM.

07:07.798 --> 07:10.030
AND I CAN SHOW HIM HOW STRONG
I AM BY MOVING THE FURNITURE

07:10.030 --> 07:11.832
SO I CAN DO THE DANCE
THAT GOES WITH IT.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.804
YES, DESPITE THAT BURNING DESIRE
TO PUT ON A SHOW,

07:13.804 --> 07:15.566
HE DOES THINK YOU'RE GAY,

07:15.566 --> 07:17.838
AND YOU BETTER PRETEND TO BE,
OR YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR JOB.

07:19.209 --> 07:20.871
HERE YOU GO, CRAIG.
(sighs)

07:20.871 --> 07:24.444
APRICOT LEMON POPPY SEED SCONES
WITH A SECRET INGREDIENT...

07:24.444 --> 07:25.846
T.L.C. (chuckles)

07:25.846 --> 07:27.818
I CAN NEVER
KEEP THAT SECRET.

07:27.818 --> 07:29.179
THANKS, GRANT.

07:30.681 --> 07:33.083
THANK YOUSO MUCH.

07:33.083 --> 07:36.727
THANK YOUSO, SO MUCH.

07:36.727 --> 07:38.729

07:39.760 --> 07:41.461
MM.

07:42.993 --> 07:44.865
THANKS.

07:46.937 --> 07:47.938
(keyboard clacking)

07:47.938 --> 07:50.470
HEY, HENRY.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.772
YOU NEVER COME IN HERE,
WILL KEEN.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.004
I'M SUSPICIOUS OF YOU
RIGHT NOW.

07:54.004 --> 07:55.806
UH, WELL,
I JUST CAME BY TO TELL YOU

07:55.806 --> 07:57.648
THAT, UH,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO, UH--

07:57.648 --> 07:58.809
GIVE ME A BIGGER OFFICE?

07:58.809 --> 07:59.810
LET YOU GO.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.782
LET ME GO
INTO A BIGGER OFFICE?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.253
NO. (sighs)

08:03.253 --> 08:07.157
I'M SORRY, HENRY.
WE'RE--WE'RE FIRING YOU.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.059
BUT YOU'RE FREE!
HOW GREAT IS THAT?

08:09.059 --> 08:10.921
UGH, I'M SO JEALOUS.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.694
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP THIS JOB.
PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME, PLEASE.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.795
I CAN BE BETTER.

08:14.795 --> 08:15.996
UH, WELL--

08:15.996 --> 08:17.868
I CAN'T BE HOME
WITH MY MOTHER ALL DAY.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.571
PLEASE.
BE MERCIFUL, WILL KEEN.

08:20.571 --> 08:24.905
O-OKAY, HENRY. I'LL--
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.679
YAY! LONG LIVE WILL KEEN!
HUZZAH!

08:30.881 --> 08:33.744
LOOK AT ALL THE CHEESES.
THEY GO ON FOR MILES.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.086
THIS IS HOW I IMAGINE
THE ROADS IN VERMONT. (sighs)

08:36.086 --> 08:38.949
I'M GONNA SIT IN A MASSAGE CHAIR
WITH SOME JELL-O

08:38.949 --> 08:40.951
SO IT AND I CAN LAUGH
AT EACH OTHER WHILE WE JIGGLE.

08:40.951 --> 08:41.952
(cackles)

08:41.952 --> 08:42.953
HA.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.825
WHAT?!
(silverware clatters)

08:44.825 --> 08:47.097
(whispers) SORRY.
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

08:47.097 --> 08:49.900
THE SIGN ON THE DOOR SAYS,
"NO SEA HAGS OR HOBGOBLINS."

08:49.900 --> 08:51.562
AND YET
THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM

08:51.562 --> 08:53.904
LETTING IN YOUNG,
SLOPPY SANTA CLAUS.

08:53.904 --> 08:54.935
GUYS, PLEASE DON'T EMBARRASS ME

08:54.935 --> 08:56.667
IN FRONT OF
ALL OF THIS FREE FOOD.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.969
CAN'T YOU JUST PRETEND
TO GET ALONG FOR ONE DAY

08:58.969 --> 09:00.641
SO THAT WE CAN
HAVE A NICE TIME?

09:00.641 --> 09:01.912
SURE, WE'RE GOOD
AT PRETENDING.

09:01.912 --> 09:02.873
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED

09:02.873 --> 09:04.715
AND WE USED TO COME
TO FANCY PLACES LIKE THIS?

09:04.715 --> 09:07.077
OH. YEAH, WE'D PLAY THIS GAME
WHERE WE'D LIE TO STRANGERS

09:07.077 --> 09:10.751
ABOUT WHO WE WERE, AND THEN LIE
SOME MORE, AND THEN KEEP LYING.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.654
IT'S CALLED
"LABYRINTH OF LIES." (laughs)

09:13.654 --> 09:15.255
OR IS IT?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.628
IT IS. OR IS IT?

09:18.789 --> 09:21.031
(whispers)
"LABYRINTH OF LIES."

09:28.839 --> 09:29.970
NOW THAT YOU'RE MANAGEMENT,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.072
WE'VE INCREASED THE SIZE
OF YOUR OFFICE BY 2 FEET.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.274
ALL THE WALLS IN THIS BUILDING
ARE ON TRACKS

09:34.274 --> 09:36.046
AND CAN BE MOVED
IN ANY DIRECTION--

09:36.046 --> 09:39.780
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, OR NORTH.
PLUS YOU NOW GET BOTTLED WATER.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.752
OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

09:41.752 --> 09:43.714
I CAN DRINK THE WATER FROM
THE COOLER IN THE BREAK ROOM.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.956
NO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DRINK THAT STUFF.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.959
(water trickling)

09:53.163 --> 09:54.965
SO I, TOO, HAVE NEWS

09:54.965 --> 09:56.967
THAT WILL SHATTER YOUR TRUST
AND MAKE YOU SICK.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.700
I DIDN'T FIRE HENRY TRUNKA.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.633
YOU'RE WEAK, THE KIND OF GUY
WHO DRINKS OUT OF 5-GALLON JUGS.

10:02.633 --> 10:06.807
W--I-IT'S JUST THAT HENRY IS
VERY VALUABLE TO THIS COMPANY.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.008
(chuckles) REALLY?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.880
YEAH, YEAH,
HE RECENTLY DISCOVERED

10:09.880 --> 10:12.342
A BRAND-NEW, GROUNDBREAKING
ACTUARY TABLE.

10:12.342 --> 10:14.084
IT IS GONNA CHANGE THE WAY

10:14.084 --> 10:16.947
INSURANCE COMPANIES ESTIMATE
OVERAGE MODIFICATION SCHEMES.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.218
HMM.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.950
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ANY OF THAT IS.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.952
I KNOW THE WORD "INSURANCE,"
OF COURSE.

10:21.952 --> 10:25.055
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND CAN STAY.

10:25.055 --> 10:26.296
THAT'S GREAT!
AND I'M GOING TO NEED

10:26.296 --> 10:29.059
SOMETHING TO SHOW THE BOARD AT
THE QUARTERLY MEETING ON FRIDAY,

10:29.059 --> 10:30.761
SO HAVE THIS FELLOW SUIT UP
FOR A PRESENTATION

10:30.761 --> 10:33.063
ABOUT THAT THING YOU MENTIONED
WITH THE WORD "INSURANCE" IN IT.

10:33.063 --> 10:35.265
Y-YOU WANT HENRY
TO MAKE A PRESENTATION?

10:35.265 --> 10:38.038
UH, WELL, Y--THE FORMULA
ISN'T QUITE READY--

10:38.038 --> 10:40.310
I AGREE.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
(pats arm)

10:40.310 --> 10:43.043
BOY, YOU DON'T REALLY LISTEN
TO OTHER PEOPLE, DO YOU?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.775
THAT'S YOUR JOB NOW, WILL.

10:44.775 --> 10:48.318
MY JOB IS TO FIND SOMEONE TO DO
THE THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO,

10:48.318 --> 10:51.081
AND I'VE DONE THAT
VERY WELL.

10:51.081 --> 10:54.354
GOOD JOB, ME! (laughs)

10:55.886 --> 10:58.288
WOW. I'VE NEVER MET
A LION TAMER BEFORE.

10:58.288 --> 11:01.031
THAT'S A PRETTY DANGEROUS JOB,
ISN'T IT?

11:01.031 --> 11:03.033
YEAH,BUT I DON'T DO
THE DEEP MOUTH WORK ANYMORE.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.865
THAT'S A YOUNG MAN'S GAME.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.138
AND I'LL EVENTUALLY BE EATEN,
BUT I'VE COME TO ACCEPT THAT.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.040
AND I'LL BE ON MY OWN,

11:10.040 --> 11:11.742
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE
NEVER REALLY ALONE

11:11.742 --> 11:15.045
WHEN YOU TRAVEL THE WORLD AS
ONE OF BEYONCE'S BACKUP SINGERS.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.007
WOW. I JUST SELL INSURANCE.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.009
YOU TWO HAVE
REALLY EXCITING LIVES.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.811
(both chuckle)

11:20.811 --> 11:23.984
THAT'S NOTHING. WAIT TILL
YOU HEAR WHAT SHE DOES.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.285
I...

11:25.285 --> 11:27.888
ENJOY MAKING POPOVERS.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.162
(under breath) THEY ACTUALLY
TAKE A LOT OF WORK.

11:32.162 --> 11:36.166
BUTWHAT IS REALLY EXCITING
ABOUT HER LIFE IS...

11:36.166 --> 11:40.000
HER FASCINATING, UNIQUE,
CONVERSATION-STARTING JOB OF...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.972
GHOST HUNTING.

11:41.972 --> 11:43.103
GOOD.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.374
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M A GHOST HUNTER.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.136
WOW.
SHE TRACKS DOWN SPIRITS

11:46.136 --> 11:48.208
THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE
CROSSING OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.211
(high-pitched voice) ♪ OOH ♪

11:51.211 --> 11:52.813
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

11:52.813 --> 11:56.446
JUST THE OTHER DAY, I SPOKE
TO THE SPIRIT OF JULIUS CAESAR.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.488
HE WAS CAUSING TROUBLE
AT AN OLD GAS STATION,

11:58.488 --> 12:00.751
SO I GOT MY GANG TOGETHER--

12:00.751 --> 12:02.953
THEY HAVEWONDERFULJUMPSUITS.
HA.

12:02.953 --> 12:05.826
♪ OOH ♪

12:05.826 --> 12:09.359
HI, WILL. I HEARD
HOW YOU SAVED HENRY'S JOB.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.932
WELL, "SAVED" IS A LITTLE--
I AM GONNA NEED A FAVOR, TOO.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.203
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

12:13.203 --> 12:15.005
I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH BOB
IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

12:15.005 --> 12:16.206
AND NOW HE'S BEING A JERK,

12:16.206 --> 12:17.207
AND HE'S EATING EVERYBODY'S FOOD
OUT OF THE FRIDGE,

12:17.207 --> 12:18.939
AND HE'S MARRIED...

12:18.939 --> 12:21.141
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO
TRANSFER ME TO ANOTHER OFFICE.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.742
OH, JENNY,
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN--

12:22.742 --> 12:25.816
OH. SO YOU CAN DO FAVORS
FOR HENRY, BUT NOT FOR ME?

12:25.816 --> 12:28.448
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.021
YAY, WILL! HUZZAH.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.284
HEY, WILL. HUZZAH.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.156
WHY AREYOUSAYING THAT?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.928
I HEARD YOU'RE DEMANDING IT
AS A GREETING.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.129
WH--

12:39.129 --> 12:42.032
SO THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED
EARLIER IN MY OFFICE.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.434
(whirring)

12:44.434 --> 12:47.167
OCCUPIED! OCCUPIED!

12:47.167 --> 12:49.099
(sighs) I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

12:49.099 --> 12:51.501
WE SHARE A WALL,
AND I WAS BEING REWARDED

12:51.501 --> 12:54.204
FOR WHAT I NOW REALIZE
IS A MISERABLE NEW JOB.

12:54.204 --> 12:56.877
BY THE WAY,
HOW'S LIFE AS A FAKE GAY MAN?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.278
IT'S CHALLENGING.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.450
I DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO BE A FAUX-MOSEXUAL.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.152
I WAS BORN SOMEONE
WHO WOULD ONE DAY

13:02.152 --> 13:03.313
HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE THIS WAY.

13:03.313 --> 13:05.285
YEAH, WELL,
DONOHUE SAW YOU AND MARCY

13:05.285 --> 13:06.486
COMING OUT OF THE COPY ROOM.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.218
WELL, MAYBE
WE WERE MAKING COPIES.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.020
NO ONE GOES IN THERE
TO MAKE COPIES.

13:10.020 --> 13:13.193
YOU GOTTA PLAY IT STRAIGHT,
AND BY "STRAIGHT," I MEAN "GAY."

13:13.193 --> 13:15.165
(sighs)

13:15.165 --> 13:16.166
(knock on door)

13:16.166 --> 13:18.368
HI, CRAIG. UH...

13:18.368 --> 13:20.200
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.501
HERE'S THE UNDERWEAR
YOU LEFT AT MY HOUSE

13:21.501 --> 13:23.133
AFTER OUR LAST SWIM LESSON.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.006
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME THOSE IN HERE.

13:27.177 --> 13:28.508
NO, NO, NOT YET.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.981
OKAY, GO, GO, GO.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.082
HERE YOU GO.

13:32.082 --> 13:33.884
OH, THANK YOU
FOR MY UNDERWEAR, COCO.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.886
I MUST HAVE LEFT MY UNDERWEAR
AT YOUR HOUSE

13:35.886 --> 13:37.447
WHEN I CHANGED
UNDERWEARS THERE.

13:37.447 --> 13:40.120
I FEEL LIKE
I'M MISSING THE JOKE,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.391
LIKE WHEN I WATCH
A "JACKASS" FILM,

13:41.391 --> 13:43.253
AND THEY PUT THEIR TESTICLES
IN DANGER.

13:43.253 --> 13:45.555
YOU ONLY HAVE TWO. WHY PLAY
FAST AND LOOSE WITH THEM?

13:45.555 --> 13:47.127
I JUST NEED MY BOSS
TO THINK I'M GAY,

13:47.127 --> 13:48.959
SO I'M PRETENDING
YOU'RE MY LOVER, COCO.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.500
YOU DECEIVED ME, CRAIG.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.002
YOU WERE DISHONEST

13:52.002 --> 13:54.104
AND MADE ME BRING YOU UNDERPANTS
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

13:54.104 --> 13:56.566
NO, I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE MAD.

13:56.566 --> 13:58.969
PLEASE COME BACK.

13:58.969 --> 14:00.310
(sighs)

14:00.310 --> 14:01.341
MARCY, HI.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.273
HI.
UH, THAT WAS MY TAILOR.

14:03.273 --> 14:05.545
I HAD TO HAVE THESE UNDERWEAR
TAKEN IN. I MEAN, LET OUT.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.618
SO... WHAT I JUST SAW
WITH YOU AND COCO--

14:08.618 --> 14:10.480
IT CONFIRMS
WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.282
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CLOSE-MINDED,

14:12.282 --> 14:15.255
BUT I HAVE A RULE
THAT I DON'T DATE GAY GUYS.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.528
MARCY, NO! COME BACK!
I HAVE THE SAME RULE!

14:18.528 --> 14:21.861
WELL, I'M SORRY, JOE.
YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.334
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SECURITY GUARD.

14:24.334 --> 14:25.335
(beep)

14:25.335 --> 14:27.297
I'M SO DONE WITH THIS JOB.

14:27.297 --> 14:30.570
OH, MY GOD. WE HAD THE BEST TIME
AT THE AVALON CLUB.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.242
WE WERE PLAYING THIS GAME

14:32.242 --> 14:34.374
WHERE WE LIE TO STRANGERS
ABOUT WHO WE ARE!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.076
(Kenny) WE MET THIS EXECUTIVE.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.078
HE THOUGHT
WE WERE ALL FASCINATING.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.251
TURNS OUT HE'S RICH.
HE OWNS A HELICOPTER.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.914
SO WE ALL WENT OFF
TO THE AIRPORT AND GOT INTO IT

14:43.914 --> 14:45.485
AND HAD OUR PICTURE TAKEN!

14:45.485 --> 14:47.217
LOOK!

14:47.217 --> 14:48.318
THEN HE BOUGHT US DINNER

14:48.318 --> 14:49.489
AT THIS SUPER-EXPENSIVE
SUSHI RESTAURANT.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.660
(haughty voice)
AND WE HAD SEA URCHIN

14:50.660 --> 14:52.192
WRAPPED IN THE STOMACH LINING
OF A SQUID

14:52.192 --> 14:54.324
SERVED IN THE RECTUM
OF A GIANT CLAM.

14:54.324 --> 14:57.297
BOY, YOU THINK YOU HIT
ROCK BOTTOM BEING BORN A CLAM,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.229
AND THEN THAT HAPPENS.
(laughs)

14:59.229 --> 15:00.330
I HAD TWO.

15:00.330 --> 15:03.233
THEN WE WENT TO
HIS PRIVATE DRIVING RANGE,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.474
AND KENNY RAN OUT THERE

15:04.474 --> 15:07.137
WHILE WE TOOK TURNS TRYING
TO HIT HIM WITH GOLF BALLS.

15:07.137 --> 15:09.339
I GOT HIM IN THE NECK.
LOOKS LIKE A HICKEY.

15:09.339 --> 15:13.283
(laughs) IT WAS SO FUNNY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, MR. EXECUTIVE?

15:13.283 --> 15:16.016
WELL, ACTUALLY, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

15:16.016 --> 15:19.149
(clears throat)
OH, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU
FOR GETTING THIS PROMOTION

15:19.149 --> 15:22.352
AND MAKING ME AN EXECUTIVE WIFE,
AND RIGHT NOW ALL I WANT TO DO

15:22.352 --> 15:25.655
IS MAKE SLIGHTLY DRUNKEN
EXECUTIVE LOVE TO YOU.

15:25.655 --> 15:26.656
EW.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.298
OH, YES, KENNY. "EW" IS RIGHT.

15:28.298 --> 15:30.160
YOUR BEST FRIEND IS ABOUT
TO MAKE DIRTY, SKETCHY LOVE

15:30.160 --> 15:32.132
TO YOUR SISTER.
HA HA HA HA.

15:32.132 --> 15:36.006
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.
DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WORK?

15:37.067 --> 15:40.170
UH, NO. NO.
JOB'S ALL GOOD.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.277
SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT
EXPENSES PER ANNUM WOULD--

15:47.277 --> 15:49.449
COME ON.
HENRY, YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.152
NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE,
WILL KEEN.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.354
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I MADE IT ALL UP,

15:54.354 --> 15:57.257
BUT THESE UPPER-LEVEL GUYS
CAN'T FOLLOW IT ANYWAY.

15:57.257 --> 16:01.731
LOOK, MY WIFE IS REALLY ENJOYING
BEING MARRIED TO AN EXECUTIVE,

16:01.731 --> 16:04.264
AND I AM REALLY
ENJOYING THE PERKS

16:04.264 --> 16:07.297
OF HER COMING HOME HAPPY
AND, FRANKLY, A LITTLE LOOSE.

16:07.297 --> 16:08.598
I LIKE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

16:08.598 --> 16:10.400
YOUR SEXY WIFE, THERESA KEEN,
WILL KEEN.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.442
NOW COME ON. FOCUS.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.744
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
TALKING TO GROUPS OF PEOPLE.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.676
YOU CAN TALK
TO PEOPLE, HENRY.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.548
YOU YELLED AT EVERYONE
AT THE COMPANY PICNIC

16:18.548 --> 16:20.380
FOR NOT LOOKING
AT YOUR KITE.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.983
NOW COME ON.
BOTH OUR JOBS DEPEND ON THIS.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.357
AND THAT IS WHY, IF YOU GO
TO THAT PERUVIAN VILLAGE TODAY,

16:27.357 --> 16:31.521
YOU WILL SEE THIS WOMAN'S IMAGE
ON EVERY SINGLE TOTEM POLE.

16:31.521 --> 16:33.623
I JUST PREPPED THE GOAT.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.365
DR. STEIN IS THE ONE

16:35.365 --> 16:37.297
WHO TRANSFERRED ITS HEART
INTO THAT VILLAGER.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.728
AND HE LIVED?

16:38.728 --> 16:42.032
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. A GOAT
CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT ITS HEART.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.405
THERE SHE IS. MEHITABEL.

MEHITABEL.

16:46.676 --> 16:49.639

I WAS HAVING SOME CHEESE.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.481
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
I'M HYPER-FOCUSED.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.743
YOU HAVE TO BE,
IN MY BUSINESS, TO STAY ALIVE--

16:53.743 --> 16:55.385
WELL, TO STAY ALIVE
IN BUSINESS.

16:55.385 --> 16:57.347
GHOST HUNTING
IS SUPER COMPETITIVE.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.388
THIS IS MY FRIEND NANCY.

16:58.388 --> 17:00.420
I TOLD HER
ABOUT YOUR AMAZING GIFT.
MM.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.293
IS IT TRUE YOU CAN
RID HOUSES OF UNWANTED SPIRITS?

17:03.293 --> 17:05.455
OH, YEAH. I HAVE THE GIFT.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.357
I CAN TALK 'EM OUT,
SCARE 'EM OUT,

17:07.357 --> 17:09.699
MOVE 'EM OUT, PUSH 'EM OUT,
STACK 'EM, TRADE 'EM, FLIP 'EM--

17:09.699 --> 17:11.231
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.363
I'M HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH AN ENTITY AT MY HOUSE.

17:13.363 --> 17:16.406
IT'S TERRORIZING ME,
KEEPING ME UP AT NIGHT,

17:16.406 --> 17:18.037
TRYING TO DRIVE ME AWAY...

17:18.037 --> 17:21.371
OH, AND SOMETIMES
BLOOD COMES OUT OF THE WALLS.

17:21.371 --> 17:24.514
SO CAN YOU COME OVER,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

17:24.514 --> 17:28.548
MM.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.121
UH, I HAVE A CHIMNEY DEMON
AT 5:00,

17:31.121 --> 17:33.283
AND I'VE ALREADY
MOVED IT THREE TIMES.

17:33.283 --> 17:35.285
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

17:35.285 --> 17:36.526
HAVE YOU SEEN HENRY?

17:36.526 --> 17:38.488
I NEED TO PREP HIM
BEFORE OUR PRESENTATION.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.190
HE LEFT. HE SAID HE COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.391
I WOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM,

17:41.391 --> 17:43.233
BUT I COULDN'T GET OUT
FROM BEHIND MY DESK.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.265
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS MEETING'S IN AN HOUR.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.298
YES, ITISSMALLER IN HERE,
WILL. NICE OF YOU TO NOTICE.

17:48.298 --> 17:50.270
I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN
FAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.641
I'LL DO IT
IF YOU MOVE YOUR WALL BACK.

17:51.641 --> 17:54.304
NO, YOU CAN'T DO IT.
DONOHUE KNOWS YOU.

17:54.304 --> 17:55.705
IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE

17:55.705 --> 18:00.150
WHO'S GOOD AT LYING.
(sighs)

18:00.150 --> 18:02.452
SIR, I'D LIKE YOU

18:02.452 --> 18:04.854
SO... THE MASTER HIMSELF.

18:04.854 --> 18:07.417
YOU KNOW, WITH THAT HAIR
AND THAT BEARD,

18:07.417 --> 18:10.360
YOU LOOK LIKE SOME SORT
OF INSURANCE PIRATE.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.791
I LIKE IT.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.563
YARR.

18:13.563 --> 18:14.464
(chuckles)

18:14.464 --> 18:16.526
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE DOING NOW?

18:18.798 --> 18:22.572
(chuckles) AND THAT IS WHY YOU
HAVE A 40 TO 60% CHARGE-OFF,

18:22.572 --> 18:25.205
NON-EXPENDITURE DEVALUATION,

18:25.205 --> 18:29.209
THUS RENDERING YOUR TABLE

18:29.209 --> 18:31.581
NAY, POST-FIXED...

18:31.581 --> 18:33.443
BREATHTAKING PRESENTATION,
KEEN.

18:33.443 --> 18:36.486
ALMOST MAKES ME WANT
TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

18:36.486 --> 18:39.118
NOW WHO WANTS A NICE,
GOOEY SLICE OF PIE CHART?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.119
(thwack)

18:40.119 --> 18:41.821
SORRY I'M LATE.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.554
RAUL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:44.554 --> 18:45.495
I'M NOT HERE.

18:45.495 --> 18:46.756
YOU'RE HAVING SOME SORT
OF ANXIETY DREAM

18:46.756 --> 18:48.198
ABOUT BEING LATE
TO A MEETING.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.599
"RAUL"?

18:49.599 --> 18:51.531
I THOUGHT YOUR NAME
WAS HENRY TRUNKA.

18:51.531 --> 18:56.506
NO, THIS IS LION-TAMING LEGEND
RAUL STALLONE.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.338
(chuckles)

18:58.338 --> 19:00.670
NOW WAIT.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, KEEN?

19:00.670 --> 19:02.812
WHAT DOES A LION TAMER KNOW
ABOUT INSURANCE?

19:02.812 --> 19:05.575
(chair scrapes floor)
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
I'M DONE LYING.

19:05.575 --> 19:07.177
MR. DONOHUE,

19:07.177 --> 19:09.619
I DID NOT FIRE HENRY,
AND I MADE ALL OF THIS UP.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.521
AND I WANT MY OLD JOB BACK,
BECAUSE FRANKLY,

19:11.521 --> 19:14.584
YOU ARE A VERY DIFFICULT MAN
TO WORK FOR.

19:14.584 --> 19:17.827
WELL, KEEN,
THAT'S ALL VERY TROUBLING--

19:17.827 --> 19:19.489
ALSO, I'M GAY.

19:19.489 --> 19:21.231
DID I MENTION THAT?

19:21.231 --> 19:22.932
CRAIG AND I ARE LOVERS.

19:22.932 --> 19:23.933
I KNEW IT!

19:23.933 --> 19:25.695
WHAT?!
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:25.695 --> 19:27.567
NO, NO,
I-I'M TOTALLY STRAIGHT,

19:27.567 --> 19:29.599
AND I DON'T CARE
IF MR. DONOHUE FIRES ME.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.501
MARCY, I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

19:31.501 --> 19:33.643
REALLY?

19:33.643 --> 19:35.205
EVERYONE...

19:35.205 --> 19:36.706
CRAIG IS GAY.

19:36.706 --> 19:37.747
OH, COME O--

19:37.747 --> 19:42.352
I KNOW BECAUSE
I'M HIS LOVER, COCO.

19:42.352 --> 19:44.554
(lowered voice) I'M SORRY,
CRAIG. I REALIZED I OVERREACTED.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.656
I'M YOUR FRIEND,
AND FRIENDS HELP EACH OTHER.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.187
YEAH, B--

19:48.187 --> 19:49.559
(normal voice)
COME ON, GAY LOVER.
NOT MY LOVER.

19:49.559 --> 19:51.721
LET'S GO HOME
AND DO WHAT WE DO.

19:51.721 --> 19:53.263
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING.

19:53.263 --> 19:54.524
YEAH, YOU'D BETTER NOT.

19:54.524 --> 19:55.725
(clenches teeth) SHUT UP!

19:55.725 --> 19:57.327
I'M SORRY, CRAIG.

19:57.327 --> 19:58.568
IT'S OVER.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.230
MARCY.MARCY.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.601
HELLO.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.503
MY NAME IS RAUL.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.435
YOU REMIND ME
OF MY GRANDMOTHER.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.537
SHE, TOO, WAS ADORABLE.

20:07.537 --> 20:09.309
(sighs)

20:16.386 --> 20:19.319
HEY, MR. BIG-TIME EXECUTIVE.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.622
ACTUALLY,
I WENT BACK TO MY OLD JOB.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.325
I JUST COULDN'T KEEP PRETENDING
TO BE SOMETHING I WASN'T.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.358
I KNOW. IT'S REALLY HARD.

20:28.358 --> 20:29.929
YOU END UP DOING THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO,

20:29.929 --> 20:31.261
LIKE CRAWLING
AROUND AN ATTIC,

20:31.261 --> 20:34.834
PRETENDING TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH A DEAD CIVIL WAR GENERAL.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.507
WOW. I THOUGHT
IHAD THE WEIRDEST DAY.

20:37.507 --> 20:38.808
HMM.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.571
I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT
AN EXECUTIVE WIFE ANYMORE.

20:41.571 --> 20:44.414
IT'S OKAY, HONEY. I NEVER WANT
TO GO BACK TO THAT CLUB, ANYWAY.

20:44.414 --> 20:47.447
I AM NOT GOOD AT CUTTING LOOSE
OR LYING TO PEOPLE

20:47.447 --> 20:50.450
OR SPEAKING IN THE VOICE
OF OL' PICKET FENCE JACKSON.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.582
YOU DONOTWANT
TO SEE THAT.

20:52.582 --> 20:54.524
YOU KNOW WHOISGOOD AT LYING?

20:54.524 --> 20:56.456
WHENEVER I ENGAGE A BIG CAT,

20:56.456 --> 20:59.359
I LIKE TO BITE HIM FIRST,
SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.962
NOW ONCE YOU GET PAST
THE LION'S INCISORS,

21:02.962 --> 21:05.295
THAT IS THE DANGER ZONE.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.768
ONE FALSE MOVE, ANDCHOMP!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.470
(blows raspberry)

21:10.470 --> 21:11.571
"AAH!"

21:11.571 --> 21:14.944
"NO!"

21:14.944 --> 21:17.607
(blows raspberry)

21:17.607 --> 21:20.410
ANY QUESTIONS?

21:20.410 --> 21:22.582
NO? LET'S MOVE ON TO PUMAS.
