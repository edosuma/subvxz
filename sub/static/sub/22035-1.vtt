01:21.315 --> 01:25.219
- You are the Wolf Mother
he was talking about.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.823
Zelda, yeah, yeah, that's you.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.493
Why Wolf Mother?

01:34.362 --> 01:37.265
- Stage name when
I'm not on stage.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.833
- You in new movie?

01:40.834 --> 01:41.669
- Nope.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.639
- Yeah, yeah, I saw something.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.442
- I haven't had a gig in years.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.444
- You working tonight?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.280

03:21.702 --> 03:24.070
- Fuck my black
jacket, white boy.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.538
- Startin' already.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.874
See, that's what I'm talkin'
about with you people.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.542
- Who the fuck you callin'
you people, white boy?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.711
Come here, I'll make
you my bitch too.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.447
- My associate here has a bullet,
if you failed to notice.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.449
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.252
He's not afraid to shoot a load,
and I'm not talkin' about

03:39.253 --> 03:41.321
some sweet cracker jizz
either, motherfucker.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.522
- Man, fuck you, honky.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.756
Come over here, bitch.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.957
Comin' here thinkin'
you're big and bad

03:44.958 --> 03:46.025
just 'cause you got a gun.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.294
Man, fuck you.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.995
Shove that right up your
fuckin' ass, white boy.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.597
Put the fucking gun down, bitch.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.599
- I'm not gonna put the fucking
gun down, motherfucker.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.933
- You ain't nothin' but a bitch.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.935
- I'm not a bitch, I
got a fuckin' dick.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.638
You're sittin' with a bitch
who's my fuckin' woman.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.207
Take your fuckin' hands off
her, do you understand?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.709
Come on.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.377
- How was I supposed to
know they were gonna wanna

04:04.378 --> 04:05.645
play dress up, huh?

04:05.646 --> 04:06.713
Am I magician?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.582
- You were supposed to text me!

04:09.583 --> 04:14.421
That was the plan, we went
over it a thousand times over.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.488
So was that the place
or not, yes or no?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.824
Was Kaitlin there?

04:17.825 --> 04:19.759
- There were chicks
there, but...

04:19.760 --> 04:21.060
- I mean, there
were chicks there.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.562
I know there were chicks there!

04:22.563 --> 04:23.830
I was there, I know there
were a lot of chicks there!

04:23.831 --> 04:25.064
I'm askin' was Kaitlin in there.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.265
Yes or no, goddamn it.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.200
- It was a whorehouse
in Chinatown, Ben.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.736
- I know it was a
fuckin' whorehouse.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.604
I was asking you
if she was there.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.606
Do you know?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.846
What the fuck was that teen
twit from San Francisco

04:39.847 --> 04:40.814
talking about?

04:40.815 --> 04:42.048
Tell me.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.050
She could've gotten
us fucking killed.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.987
- What would it
have mattered, Ben?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.591
Jealousy is a bitch.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.193
I decided love wasn't me
after three marriages.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.396
Every year since, it's
proved to be true.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.197
Then she had to show
her fuckin' mug.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.009
If you didn't catch
it, it's Benjamin.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.845
Some people call me Benny,
but I just prefer Ben.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.047
Benny sounds like a kid's
name or somethin'.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.449
I don't need that.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.118
My whole life's been
one, big, long-ass fuck

05:19.119 --> 05:20.620
of a hide and seek.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.391
I robbed everything, grocery
stores, service stations.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.562
Stole this wreck from a poor
bastard while she was pumpin'.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.513
- I find myself indulging
in the nightly

05:46.514 --> 05:49.248
ritual of puttin' a
gun to my tonsils.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.418
Call it guilt, call
it whatever you want.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.652
Maybe age.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.821
I woke up one morning
and I said to myself

05:54.822 --> 05:57.223
I don't wanna do
this shit anymore.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.158
I guess I started
to have feelings,

05:59.159 --> 06:01.528
yet at the same time I hated
every single motherfucker

06:01.529 --> 06:04.764
who walked the face of the
Earth, especially pussy.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.799
Yeah, don't try to
figure that joint out.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.602
But see, if you've been in
this racket since a rugrat,

06:09.603 --> 06:12.071
what choice do you
really have, really?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.641
What I needed was somethin'
to get my ass out of it all,

06:14.642 --> 06:17.209
and one day that somethin'
licked my sack.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.579
I used the greasy spoon across
the street when I needed

06:19.580 --> 06:21.013
a change of vibe.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.149
I had to rob some poor
maw every morning

06:23.150 --> 06:26.619
just to reserve my seat and
gobble up some grub and OJ.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.221
I even got to know all
the meat flaps by name.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.792
I screwed one a week,
sometimes two at a time.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.564
There was Lauren, Dakota,
Kim, Chris, Sarina.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.700
Oh man, she was black
as the ace of spades.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.069
Oh, and Hayley, she had
a stuttering problem.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.371
- Aye, aye, aye, aye aye.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.474
- I enjoyed makin' 'em
feel uncomfortable.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.075
Gave me an enjoyable rod.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.577
I'd stare at them
as they walked by

06:50.578 --> 06:53.345
as if there was somethin'
wrong with their appearance.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.315
Shit paper stickin' out of
the bottom of their shoe.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.917
Panties stickin' out.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.519
Maybe even a string
hanging from under

06:59.520 --> 07:01.588
their greasy spoon apron.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.123
It's fun, you should try it
when it takes any longer

07:04.124 --> 07:07.560
than 20 minutes to get two
scrambled eggs and hash.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.062
- Hi, want a top off?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.798
- Oh Jesus, my dear,

07:11.799 --> 07:15.468
I would love to see you
with your top off.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.504
You know, you look like
a Hollywood movie star.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.738
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.307
I know people, I can
make that shit happen.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.642
- I would love that.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.711
- I'm sure you would, Erica.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.746
Turn around, let me
see your backside.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.582
Oh, even better, nice.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.519
You work here a lot?

07:32.520 --> 07:35.822
- Just a couple months, you
know, until I make it big.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.725
- Oh, you're gonna make
it big, I promise.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.795
- I'm Erica, and
I'll be your server.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.032
Oh yeah, that's right, can
I start you with a drink

07:46.033 --> 07:47.934
or a coffee or?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.101
Oh God, I'm gonna cum.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.003
I'm gonna cum.

07:50.003 --> 07:50.838
Yeah.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.006
Oh God, oh yeah.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.075
Oh my God, you're so rough.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.044
- Yeah, fuck me harder, come on.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.679
For weeks, I'd watch
every person who entered

07:59.680 --> 08:02.181
from nine in the morning
to four in the afternoon.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.884
I jotted down what they
wore, their hair styles,

08:04.885 --> 08:06.152
their shoe color.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.620
I figured I'd use
it for somethin'.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.022
Sounded intelligent anyways.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.765

I need to see your I.D.
and proof of residency.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.173
- I didn't know you needed
that residency thing.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.575
Why would you need that?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.977
- Well, in case I need
to reach your family.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.879
- Why would you need
to talk to my family?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.717
- In case of a death
or something.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.255
- Okay, listen, I don't
have any family, okay?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.692
But I got I.D., is that good?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.395
- Mr. Levinson.
- Yes.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.964
- I need to see a utility
bill or something

09:24.965 --> 09:27.234
that shows your name on it.

09:29.904 --> 09:32.572
- Jackie, honey, you'll be okay.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.207
You can do better than him.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.044
- I loved him so much.

09:46.754 --> 09:50.990
- This has been absolutely
the worst day for me.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.493
It keeps on gettin' worse too.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.831
Listen, I'm in the
middle of a divorce,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.300
and I'm in the middle of places

10:01.301 --> 10:03.402
that I really don't
wanna talk about.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.943
Please, do you have any
tissues or something?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.846
- Yeah.
- So embarassing for me.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.015
Oh, thank you.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.550
She just upped and left
me just like that.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.921
I mean, you know, took everything,
took my baseball glove,

10:21.922 --> 10:24.623
took the kids, took
everything, you know?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.492
Didn't even tell me anything.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.727
She told me nothing.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.295
Just gone, I go home
and it's all gone.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.199
- That's horrible.
- It is horrible.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.569
- You know, my...

10:40.440 --> 10:41.741
- Yes?

10:41.742 --> 10:45.477
- You know, my husband
and I just separated.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.313
- No shit.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.783
You know, sometimes
I think things

10:50.784 --> 10:53.652
are just meant to be, Jackie.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.587
- How do you know my name?

10:55.588 --> 10:57.189
- I'm sorry?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.525
- I lost my tag.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.395
- Are you an actress?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.865
- Maybe.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.901
- See, see, now how
did I know that?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.436
I know people in
Hollywood, you know.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.438
I can make that shit
fuckin' happen.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.041
- Oh shit.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.345
- Oh, you have great tits.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.482
Oh yeah.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.086
- Oh yeah.
- Oh, I want you, yeah.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.224
You're not wearing anything.

11:32.225 --> 11:36.229
You're not wearing underwear,
you naughty thing.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.703
Jesus Christ.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.439
I know, I know. - Tonight.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.741
- Tonight, yeah, yeah.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.942

11:49.943 --> 11:53.045
Where do you live?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.380

Oh, it hurts.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.345
Fuckin' asshole.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.213
What's wrong with you?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.781
- You think I could
spend the night here?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.451
- Fuck you.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.519

13:07.520 --> 13:10.823

13:10.824 --> 13:12.925
He was young and impressionable.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.661
All I know is that while I was
toolin' his uncircumcised

13:15.662 --> 13:19.098
managerial longhorn, my eyes
were anything but focused

13:19.099 --> 13:20.466
on his sack.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.734
Oh, and about those cameras.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.770
Yeah, I didn't have
to worry about that.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.772
The queer had it off.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.007
What can I say?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.275

13:56.904 --> 13:57.937
These are bullshit.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.505
I'm takin' you with me.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.340
Being a little kid thief,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.910
it gave me some
popularity in school too.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.378
It's not like my rents
gave a fuck about me.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.347
Nah, it was all about
the thirst to live.

- In one weekend, two
night sleepover,

14:41.314 --> 14:43.415
I walked away with enough
cheddar stacks to start

14:43.416 --> 14:44.883
a fresh existence.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.120
I never need to finger
another individual again.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.123
Honestly, that
thought set me free.

14:51.124 --> 14:55.327
No more bein' a loser, robbin'
stores, mothers, homeless.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.197
See, I had to do this one
final bad to do good,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.632
and if that's what it took to
end this fail I was livin',

15:00.633 --> 15:01.434
so be it.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.203
Yeah, well, keep
dreamin', people.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.274
It ended just a tad differently.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.276
God damn it.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.011
Fuck!

15:12.012 --> 15:12.946
Fuck, fuck!

15:16.649 --> 15:18.385
The fuck do you want?

15:21.721 --> 15:25.892
The decision that I'd make
next would change everything.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.896
- She said you raped her.

15:30.998 --> 15:31.831
- What?

15:33.000 --> 15:33.833
Rape?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.504
No, I don't think so, Joe.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.172
I don't remember her
runnin' away when she paid

15:40.173 --> 15:42.441
for that roach motel.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.043
- You have proof of that?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.012
- Proof of what?

15:46.013 --> 15:48.247
- That she paid for the room.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.583
- Fellas, take a look at me.

15:51.718 --> 15:55.254
Take the time to take
a good look at me.

15:55.255 --> 15:59.425
- You like treatin' women like that, Mr.
Brooklyn?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.293
- Alright, wait a second.
- This ain't the first time

16:01.294 --> 16:03.429
we had you in here for
somethin' like this.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.497
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.333
- Before I answer your question,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.435
which is a good one by the way,

16:09.436 --> 16:12.238
what you're telling me is
that I'm here because some

16:12.239 --> 16:13.872
bank clerk said I raped her?

16:13.873 --> 16:17.943
- It could be classified a
non-consensual situation, yes.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.279
- And that's it?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.549
Well, let me tell you
something, Columbo.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.751
They're only good for one
thing, and that's the wet spot.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.586
You dig?

16:29.322 --> 16:33.592
- Well, while we have you here,
by chance, just by chance,

16:33.593 --> 16:36.662
you wouldn't happen to
know who shot a cop

16:36.663 --> 16:39.498
in the valley last Monday?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.333
- No.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.270
What the fuck is this?

16:44.271 --> 16:45.437
- Oh, that's Panda Bear.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.439
He's kind of a
celebrity around here.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.375
- The fuck is he doin'?

16:48.376 --> 16:49.675
- Go ahead, Panda.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.878
Yeah, that's right, and
you have no idea, do ya,

16:52.879 --> 16:56.448
who may have put our
officer in a coma?

16:56.449 --> 16:59.518
- Coma?
- That's right, a coma!

16:59.519 --> 17:00.619
- No, I don't!
- Go on, Panda.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.853
Let him have it.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.122
Come on, buddy, I
want some info.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.223
Whenever you're ready.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.929
I want some information.

17:10.930 --> 17:14.633
I want to know who the
fuck shot that officer!

17:14.634 --> 17:17.669
And I want to know why he's
in a coma, goddamn it!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.538
That's a nice 45.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.972
Can you believe it?

17:20.973 --> 17:23.075
After everything, they brought
me in 'cause I was rough

17:23.076 --> 17:24.776
in bed with the clerk.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.579
Now, before I continue,
let me just be real.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.815
I shot the cop in the leg.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.850
I didn't know the impact
of his melon smashing

17:31.851 --> 17:34.886
into the pavement was gonna
cause a goddamn coma.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.788
I never shot anyone in my life,

17:36.789 --> 17:40.226
and I sure as hell didn't
plan on a cop being my first.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.328
I never had any intentions
to hurt anybody,

17:42.329 --> 17:44.396
but what was I supposed to do?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.165
One second you think you're
gonna spend the rest

17:46.166 --> 17:48.500
of your life in prison
only to find out

17:48.501 --> 17:51.437
it'll just be for a handful
of days for stolen plates,

17:51.438 --> 17:53.305
which is why my raunchy
ass was pulled over

17:53.306 --> 17:54.740
in the first place.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.205
- Yo, man, goin'
anywhere special?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.607
I'm stuck in the '70s too.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.908
- A little dark to be
wearin' those shades,

18:29.909 --> 18:31.744
don't you think whore?

18:33.012 --> 18:36.683
Oh God, you leeches are
nothing but trouble.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.486
- Oh, why's that, huh baby?

18:40.487 --> 18:41.720
We're honest, right?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.789
We give a service for
an agreed price tag.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.493
It's not like we're
robbin' banks or nothin'.

18:47.494 --> 18:51.330
- What I said was, bimbo,
your gender as a whole

18:51.331 --> 18:52.932
is a bullshit joke.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.738
- What, I'm not
good enough for ya?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.573
I'll do anything you want.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.908
Primo stuff here, man.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.411
Anything, name it.

19:07.079 --> 19:11.251
- What do you think, you
think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.420
- I'm not a cop.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.689
- Well, how do I know that?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.098
- I'm hungry, okay?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.670
I'm embarrassed, man.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.276
It was her eyes.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.779
Nothin' else, it was her eyes.

19:49.522 --> 19:53.693
- I moved to New York when I
was 14, then back to Austin,

19:54.761 --> 19:57.664
then to the Boulevard
of Broken BJs.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.533
Anyways, what I was sayin',
this girl and her pooch

20:01.534 --> 20:03.969
were sittin' on the subway
platform in New York.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.205
Homeless as shit, real bad.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.776
This pup, this pup was
all she had in life.

20:10.777 --> 20:15.347
And wouldn't you know it,
someone called the SPCA on her.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.549
They came and they
took the only thing

20:17.550 --> 20:19.386
this girl had in life.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.655
Her best friend, her partner.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.527
It upset someone that they had
to see this animal suffer

20:28.528 --> 20:30.596
every day on their way
to their cubical,

20:30.597 --> 20:33.164
yet this gal, this human bein',

20:33.165 --> 20:35.867
which hundreds of thousands
of rich white fucks

20:35.868 --> 20:39.972
passed every fuckin' day,
not once tried to help.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.476
But a dog.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.451
So I ask you, what kind
of world do we live in

20:52.452 --> 20:55.387
when we're willin'
to help an animal,

20:55.388 --> 20:58.625
but we're unwillin'
to help each other?

21:00.893 --> 21:04.464
'Cause we have it wrong,
we're the animals.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.374
The man who believes
he knows everything

21:15.375 --> 21:18.610
is the man who learns nothing.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.681
Remember that,
whatever your name is.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.185
- Ben.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.926
- What in the world did a
chick have to do to you, Ben,

21:34.927 --> 21:37.430
to make you all, I don't know.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.367
You're like a putz.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.173
- This isn't a Q and A, Zelda.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.981
- So you know.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.850
- I might've seen you
on a couple of those

21:58.851 --> 22:01.354
Hollywood trash rags years ago.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.091
Child star turns street crawler.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.227
They lift you up as
high as they could

22:09.228 --> 22:12.799
before they had their
fun tearing you down.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.536
Your eyes haven't changed.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.814
- So you have a
car or somethin'?

22:31.884 --> 22:34.554
You wanna go back to your place?

22:47.033 --> 22:50.702
- I don't have a place,
so let it be yours.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.505
And we're not hitchin'
together, okay?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.341
You find your own way.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.195
Let's make it 11.

23:17.964 --> 23:21.900
- I believe I was just
promoted from whore to escort.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.136
- No, you're still a whore.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.611
- Well, here we are.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.948
- This Kaitlin, the
one from the movies?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.351
- Yeah.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.886
- I said pigtails.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.388
I wanted pigtails.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.290
- Pigtails.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.228
Well, who'd you speak to?

24:27.233 --> 24:28.467
- I don't know.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.272
- Sherlock, where are the tails?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.774
- I don't know, man.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.408
I mean, is he serious?

24:37.409 --> 24:38.244
- Shh.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.649
Bobby, I can't do tails.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.387
Can you do tails?

24:49.889 --> 24:50.723
- No.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.826
- Momma, can you do tails?

24:54.827 --> 24:57.063
There you go, we got tails.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.733
- Can you make
sure they're even.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.168
They don't look even already.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.207
- Even.

25:09.942 --> 25:10.777
- Even.

25:14.647 --> 25:18.183
- So is it true what
they say about you guys?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.417
- What's that?

25:19.418 --> 25:20.819
- That you're into
some weird shit.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.258
- You got that one right.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.530
- Are we?
- Weird shit.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.902
Let me ask you a
question, Bobby.

25:36.903 --> 25:40.807
What does a highly
successful man like yourself

25:42.541 --> 25:43.810
consider weird?

25:46.145 --> 25:48.847
Would you say it's weird
that a distinguished,

25:48.848 --> 25:53.384
married gentleman like yourself
paid us to lick the hole

25:53.385 --> 25:57.556
of a girl as young as his two
sleepin' daughters at home?

25:58.424 --> 25:59.391
Is that weird?

25:59.392 --> 26:01.160
Is that uneven, Bobby?

26:02.328 --> 26:05.665
- Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.237
- Chantin' your name, Bobby.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.372
- How do you know
about my daughters?

26:14.373 --> 26:15.207
- Well.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.844
- I just wanna make sure

26:18.845 --> 26:21.580
that she's not
diseased or anything.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.450
I haven't done this before.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.953
- Yeah, me too, this
is our first time.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.254
So we're all in the
same boat here.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.327
- I wanna do things.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.731
I wanna do bad things to her.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.702
Can she hear any of this?

26:45.705 --> 26:46.873
Does she bite?

26:49.842 --> 26:52.310
- She ain't a snapping
turtle, Bobby,

26:52.311 --> 26:56.514
but now if you want her
to bite, she can bite.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.349
- Bobby, she can bite.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.518
Look, she has.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.689
- I don't want her
biting or struggling

27:03.690 --> 27:05.524
or anything that like.

27:06.959 --> 27:11.130
I just want her to sit there
and let me do my thing.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.834
I don't want screaming
or struggling.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.336
- Hey, Bobby, sir.

27:20.072 --> 27:24.243
That little cunt won't even
know you're in the room.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.447
Bobby, just take it.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.005
- Come on.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.307
- There you go.

28:15.061 --> 28:18.497
To the start of a new
business, Sherlock.

28:25.504 --> 28:29.274
There's a lot more green
in tater tots, you see.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.109
- Yeah.

28:31.143 --> 28:31.978
- Yeah.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.784
- What the fuck?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.619
- I owe you, you shit.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.315
My bad.

29:18.490 --> 29:22.094
He never felt like he
was part of The Band.

29:24.730 --> 29:28.567
Now I got a confession,
I'm not a real doctor.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.881
We need to clean the house,

29:42.882 --> 29:46.284
make room for all this
new young candy, right?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.419
I need you all to gather up
all this primordial pussy

29:48.420 --> 29:52.390
we've been dealin' with
and bring 'em to me.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.292
Let's just say their
snappers are retired

29:54.293 --> 29:55.895
startin' right now.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.967
Hey, remember, no more
hair betwixt their legs.

30:01.934 --> 30:02.768
No, sir.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.473
Give me one of them tacos.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.308
- Sure.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.916
- Bobby, how's it feelin'?

30:23.890 --> 30:25.123
- You got a problem with me?

30:25.124 --> 30:27.292
You got a fuckin'
problem, whore?

30:33.165 --> 30:37.068
- Look at this stupid
fucking idiot.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.536
- It's a fuckin' customer, yes?

30:38.537 --> 30:41.606
Let's see the fuckin'
merchandise, people.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.909
Stand there on the curb,
that's where you belong.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.176
That's your fuckin' playground.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.013
Gonna get a little slim
next week, goddamn it.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.915
- The fuck am I doing here?
- Here we go, here we go.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.716
Come on, prize heifers, ladies.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.851
- Police are still trying
to figure out exactly

30:53.852 --> 30:55.353
what's going on here.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.522
They're not even certain the
nine-year-old Hollywood actress

30:57.523 --> 31:00.225
was being held at this complex.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.860
They did find the Halloween
mask that Kaitlin was seen

31:02.861 --> 31:06.131
wearing downtown with her
abductors yesterday afternoon.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.266
What police did find
was a crime scene.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.568
The decapitated body of a
Los Angeles real estate

31:10.569 --> 31:14.405
businessman alongside the
mutilated body of another victim

31:14.406 --> 31:17.275
with known ties to the
Satanic group The Band.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.977
The Band has been linked
to several murders...

31:18.978 --> 31:20.678
And a prostitution ring

31:20.679 --> 31:22.348
here in L.A. County.

31:49.308 --> 31:53.245
<i>♪ A woman found me lost at sea ♪</i>

31:56.782 --> 32:00.652
<i>♪ Strange words she said to me ♪</i>

32:04.190 --> 32:08.360
<i>♪ Lose yourself, ♪
♪ it'll set you free ♪</i>

32:11.630 --> 32:15.801
<i>♪ Lose yourself, ♪
♪ it'll see you free ♪</i>

32:17.203 --> 32:19.104
- You don't have time to
fumble with ammo with a cock

32:19.105 --> 32:20.106
in your ass.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.909
- I'll take your word for it.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.980
Let me feel your tits. - What?

32:28.981 --> 32:32.917
- Take off your bra and
let me feel your tits.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.019
- You know who I am.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.186
I'm not the fuckin' cops.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.322
- Well, I don't believe
you, Deep Throat.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.157
Now do it.

32:42.694 --> 32:43.529
Bingo.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.971
- You're a little paranoid,
don't you think?

32:55.174 --> 32:57.975
- I told myself I'd never
do this shit again.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.512
Pussy keeps sucking me back in.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.981
Do you have anything to drink?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.817
- I don't usually offer
drinks to Johns.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.486
- Well, I usually don't
stick around when I find

33:08.487 --> 33:11.889
a loaded gun two
inches from my dick,

33:11.890 --> 33:15.894
but I guess there's a first
time for everything.

33:29.108 --> 33:32.243
- Why are you so paranoid
of the cops, hm?

33:32.244 --> 33:34.580
You on the run or somethin'?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.751
Here, don't get excited,
it's a five-dollar bottle.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.225
- Why do you do this anyways?

33:50.662 --> 33:54.833
I'm a petty thief who thought
he could loot a bank,

33:57.103 --> 33:59.003
and I almost got away with it.

33:59.004 --> 34:00.706
- You're not serious.

34:01.607 --> 34:02.608
A bank, you?

34:07.045 --> 34:10.215
Takin' the American
dream free of charge.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.250
- That's not funny.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.619
- Don't take it personally.

34:14.620 --> 34:18.290
You just don't seem hip
enough to, you know.

34:22.261 --> 34:25.097
- I was brought in
a few weeks ago

34:26.697 --> 34:28.399
for what I thought
would've been my ass,

34:28.400 --> 34:32.571
but it was because I screwed
one of you, no offense.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.641
- Wow, pickin' up a date.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.846
That's bad ass, no offense.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.552
And just look where you are now.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.987
- Well, she really
wasn't a whore.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.757
She was a bank clerk.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.896
So I don't know, maybe
she was a whore.

34:58.897 --> 35:02.100
She just didn't ask
for a deposit slip.

35:03.302 --> 35:07.273
A whore that cared about
my financial stability.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.077
- You're not that bank
guy who shot a cop

35:13.078 --> 35:15.247
a couple weeks ago, right?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.549
I heard it on the news.

35:18.550 --> 35:22.320
- For a second, I thought
about spillin' my beans.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.855
The idea of gettin' some of
this weight off my shoulders

35:24.856 --> 35:27.158
sounded better than a
Hollywood blowjob.

35:27.159 --> 35:27.993
No.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.234
- So why rob banks, hm?

35:40.839 --> 35:44.009
Why not try to get a
job or somethin'?

35:50.416 --> 35:52.350
- You don't know what
you're talkin' about.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.951
With my record?

35:53.952 --> 35:57.389
And I don't rob banks,
I robbed one bank.

35:59.090 --> 36:02.861
- You could still try,
you know, to get a job.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.332
- Oh, I see.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.669
Advice from a 30-something
street snatch.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.906
You like suckin'
off L.A.'s finest?

36:16.708 --> 36:19.278
Getting paid with street tacos?

36:21.980 --> 36:26.784
- Wow, aren't we two depressed
misfits on a Friday night?

36:26.785 --> 36:30.121
A wannabe whore and a
coward pickpocket.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.396
- Don't kid yourself.

36:38.397 --> 36:42.568
We're no different from the
rest of 'em out there.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.607
You ever feel lonely here?

36:49.608 --> 36:50.876
- In the motel?

36:52.110 --> 36:53.044
- No, here.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.092
- Get in the bathroom.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.394
No, hide, hide.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.861
No, no, no, go in the bathroom.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.531
Get in the bathroom.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.769
- If it's the cops, I'm goin'
out the fuckin' window.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.084
- Where's the money?

37:33.952 --> 37:35.152
Where's the money?

37:35.153 --> 37:36.388
- On the table.

37:39.224 --> 37:43.761
- You know they wanted me
to kill your useless cunt.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.431
You're no tater tot.

37:52.871 --> 37:53.705
Hey.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.010
Why don't you come outside

38:00.446 --> 38:04.082
so we can play a little
game of hide and go seek?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.017
What do you say?

38:30.976 --> 38:35.513
You think it'd be okay if I
was to have one last lay

38:35.514 --> 38:37.349
with your corpse, huh?

38:42.454 --> 38:46.557
I promise it's gonna be so good
they're gonna be feelin' it

38:46.558 --> 38:48.059
in the afterworld.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.531
- Sir.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.469
I'm the manager of this motel.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.805
I have to ask you to be just
a little more considerate

39:00.806 --> 39:02.607
with the noise.

39:02.608 --> 39:07.144
- Mr. J., can't you see
what's happenin' here?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.194
- I bailed from the window.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.530
I'd be lying if I said
it didn't eat me up.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.532
Left her ass for dead.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.233
She told me all about it.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.770
The Swiss cheese face
of the motel manager

40:05.771 --> 40:09.941
and her homemade bullet
holes in Bitches the pimpy.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.712
What the woman didn't
tell me at the time

40:14.713 --> 40:18.148
was she decided to pack the odd
couple to cover her tracks.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.818
Sneaky little thing.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.224
I wasn't prepared.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.193
You just caught me off guard.

40:28.194 --> 40:29.960
What are you gonna do?

40:29.961 --> 40:31.829
- What's your
advice, pickpocket?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.864
- You know, I'm gettin'
pretty sick and tired

40:33.865 --> 40:36.667
of you thinkin' I'm some
sort of a selfish prick.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.068
- You fuckin' left me
there, you coward.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.451
Rape!

40:53.452 --> 40:54.819
Get off of me.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.086
- Shh, listen.
- Don't fucking touch me.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.321
- Listen, I'm broke and
I have nowhere to go.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.289
- Oh please, explain why
I would give a fuck.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.091
- Because you're broke and
you have nowhere to go.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.593
- I have cash.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.294
Don't you pretend to know the
ins and outs of my shit.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.764
- You listen to me, woman.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.933
You agreed to meet me here, why?

41:08.934 --> 41:10.034
'Cause you had to get the
weight of last night

41:10.035 --> 41:11.702
off your shoulders.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.540
Well, I got some
weight of my own.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.677
He didn't die.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.781
Don't get all freaky on me now.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.283
I'm no cop killer.

41:26.718 --> 41:30.388
That said, I shot a cop so
I'm good as bein' dead.

41:32.457 --> 41:36.628
So whatever you're mixed up
in, you're not alone, okay?

41:39.798 --> 41:43.067
At least you didn't shoot
an innocent person.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.571
- Why are you telling me this?

41:46.772 --> 41:47.606
- Why?

41:49.474 --> 41:50.841
- Yeah.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.342
- You wanna know why?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.178
- Yeah.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.082
- I don't know why.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.755
- Ever kill anyone?

42:05.791 --> 42:06.792
- No, never.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.665
What'd you do with the body?

42:17.268 --> 42:20.504
- I left him there at the motel.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.411
- You just left him.

42:28.079 --> 42:31.181
The manager of the
hotel as well?

42:31.182 --> 42:32.249
- Yeah.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.688
- That's great.

42:37.689 --> 42:40.157
That's fuckin' perfect.

42:40.158 --> 42:43.628
You little stutterin'
little thing you.

42:43.629 --> 42:45.396
- I'm not stutterin'.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.000
- No, no.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.909
You can say we
bonded over pizza.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.678
We also both confessed
to being losers

43:00.679 --> 43:02.880
who couldn't even
take our own lives.

43:02.881 --> 43:06.718
I knew she had more
baggage, but I didn't pry.

43:11.990 --> 43:15.160
- That cop is eatin'
you up, isn't it?

43:18.730 --> 43:22.833
That's why we can't pull
the trigger, you know.

43:22.834 --> 43:26.838
If we leave the world with
that kind of baggage,

43:28.339 --> 43:32.510
we fear what will be waitin'
for us on the other side.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.250
I have a proposition.

43:43.021 --> 43:45.523
We can't start this life over,

43:48.660 --> 43:51.496
but we can do the
next best thing.

43:52.931 --> 43:56.601
What if I told you I knew
of somethin' that would

43:58.904 --> 44:01.272
allow us to feel human again,

44:03.641 --> 44:07.813
and then we could rest in peace
by pullin' that trigger.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.218
- You still have life left.

44:18.589 --> 44:22.761
- I think we can find that
missin' Hollywood girl.

44:31.136 --> 44:33.037
The kidnappers fled to
San Fran after the cops

44:33.038 --> 44:34.972
raided their shit
the other night.

44:34.973 --> 44:36.707
- Do you know these people?

44:36.708 --> 44:38.275
- Only Bitches.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.510
I know as much about the
others as anyone else.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.346
- Bitches, the pimp you
made into Swiss cheese?

44:42.347 --> 44:46.784
- Right, he used me as
kind of a side business.

44:46.785 --> 44:50.287
I never met the rest of The
Band, but you best believe

44:50.288 --> 44:51.756
they certainly know about me.

44:51.757 --> 44:53.824
- The Band?
- Mm hm.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.960
They call themselves The Band.

44:55.961 --> 44:58.395
Some Manson wannabes.

44:58.396 --> 45:00.197
They're killin' off
all the workin' girls

45:00.198 --> 45:02.332
who show any signs
of pubic hair,

45:02.333 --> 45:05.602
keepin' their girls
preteen across the board.

45:05.603 --> 45:07.137
Probably figured little
movie star Kaitlin

45:07.138 --> 45:08.539
would be big biz.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.011
- Well, what makes you think
we could find these people?

45:14.012 --> 45:15.946
- You have anything
else on your interary?

45:15.947 --> 45:17.782
- But we don't even have wheels.

45:17.783 --> 45:18.784
I left mine.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.353
A Mustang.

45:23.354 --> 45:25.489
Oh, Pimpy did well.

45:25.490 --> 45:28.993
- There's this teen
gal up there, Jennie,

45:28.994 --> 45:31.962
who I know works
closely with The Band.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.430
She'll help.

45:33.431 --> 45:36.867
She's a sweetheart who just got
wrapped up into their shit.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.202
I've been tryin' to
get her ass straight,

45:38.203 --> 45:41.206
but she has no
guidance to speak of.

45:42.607 --> 45:46.043
She must know more, you know,
give us their whereabouts.

45:46.044 --> 45:48.879
She'll be tight, so we're gonna
have to give her some cash

45:48.880 --> 45:52.317
to get her to spit the
details, you know?

45:54.352 --> 45:57.355
- My brother lives
in San Francisco.

45:59.390 --> 46:00.690
- And?

46:00.691 --> 46:03.727
- You just said that
they're killin'.

46:03.728 --> 46:07.097
How do you know this Jennie
chick isn't rottin' already?

46:07.098 --> 46:09.766
- I don't, but the
last time we spoke,

46:09.767 --> 46:14.104
she gave me her address in
case I was ever up in the Bay.

46:14.105 --> 46:17.943
May be a coincidence they
went there, may not.

46:19.710 --> 46:23.247
- Well, we still have to
do bad before we do good,

46:23.248 --> 46:26.183
so if we have to pay this
little San Fran teen bimbo...

46:26.184 --> 46:27.818
- Cool it, okay?

46:27.819 --> 46:28.820
She's chill.

46:30.155 --> 46:32.824
As far as dough, we'll get jobs.

46:35.526 --> 46:38.762
Both of us, just
outside of San Fran,

46:38.763 --> 46:41.065
just until we have enough
cash to follow through

46:41.066 --> 46:42.900
with the plan.

46:42.901 --> 46:46.636
If we're gonna do this thing,
we have to do it legit.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.574
Otherwise what's
the fuckin' point?

46:51.342 --> 46:55.545
- Listen, I just wanna
put this out there.

46:55.546 --> 46:58.216
I see the way you been eyin' me.

47:00.018 --> 47:03.120
So if we do this thing,
we're just partners.

47:03.121 --> 47:04.989
That's it, okay?

47:04.990 --> 47:05.990
- You're not serious.

47:05.991 --> 47:08.258
- No, I'm just sayin'.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.527
Let's say we find this
Jennie chick who helps us

47:10.528 --> 47:13.364
find this actress
girl, then what?

47:18.769 --> 47:21.305
- Then we accept forgiveness
from whoever it is

47:21.306 --> 47:23.073
we're seekin' it from,

47:23.074 --> 47:27.245
and we stop bein' pussies and
we blow our brains out, Ben.

47:33.251 --> 47:35.419
- You got a deal.

47:35.420 --> 47:36.254
- Groovy.

47:55.073 --> 47:59.244
<i>♪ Night is the time when ♪

48:02.213 --> 48:05.950

48:05.951 --> 48:09.053
- And no resumes, huh?

48:09.054 --> 48:10.454
- No, sir.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.522
No, but we would
really love to work

48:12.523 --> 48:15.492
at your wonderful
establishment here.

48:15.493 --> 48:16.661
- Why?

48:17.895 --> 48:18.729
- 'Cause.

48:20.365 --> 48:21.766
- 'Cause?

48:26.371 --> 48:29.941
- Well, sir, this is a
little embarrassing.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.643
How do I say this?

48:34.946 --> 48:39.016
Your establishment here has
a really special place

48:39.017 --> 48:41.018
in our hearts really.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.419
- You're kidding me, right?

48:42.420 --> 48:44.255
- No, actually...

48:45.356 --> 48:47.858
- No, what he's tryin' to say.

48:50.828 --> 48:52.397
Damn it, I'm sorry.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.035
God, it's just so
emotional, man.

49:00.805 --> 49:03.007
- Are you okay, Boo-boo?

49:03.008 --> 49:03.841
- Huh?

49:05.710 --> 49:08.478
- Well, you know, this is
very emotional for us really.

49:08.479 --> 49:09.746
This whole thing here.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.215
- Oh, I just can't stop.

49:11.216 --> 49:12.816
This shit bothers me.

49:12.817 --> 49:14.485
You know that, Theo.

49:16.321 --> 49:17.255
- Theo?

49:19.790 --> 49:22.460
- I'm sorry, why are you crying?

49:23.494 --> 49:24.562
- Well, Mr...

49:25.430 --> 49:27.131
- Lopez, Mr. Lopez.

49:27.132 --> 49:29.899
- Right, Mr. Lopez, yes.

49:29.900 --> 49:32.637
You see, well, how
do I say this?

49:35.773 --> 49:38.242
You see your parking
lot out there?

49:38.243 --> 49:41.146
Well, that was the
first place we...

49:43.981 --> 49:45.515
- Excuse me?

49:45.516 --> 49:47.785
- First place we made love.

49:51.089 --> 49:53.257
- You two.

49:53.258 --> 49:54.092
- Yes.

49:56.094 --> 49:58.362
Why is that so hard to believe?

49:58.363 --> 50:00.031
- Well, you're like.

50:02.133 --> 50:03.800
Are you married?

50:03.801 --> 50:05.035
- Oh no, sir.

50:05.036 --> 50:08.438
No, we're not even a
couple anymore, right?

50:08.439 --> 50:11.208
We're just chill friends.

50:11.209 --> 50:12.942
- Yeah, that's right.

50:12.943 --> 50:15.279
We fucked once in your parking
lot, and that's it, you know?

50:15.280 --> 50:18.048
We're just partners now, you
know, it can happen to ya.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.516
It will happen, right?

50:19.517 --> 50:23.154
- What I mean is do you have
any references at least?

50:25.256 --> 50:29.427
- What do you mean, like
actual people references?

50:31.296 --> 50:32.130
Well.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.991
Can I ask you why you have bags?

51:01.992 --> 51:04.294
I mean, can we just stop and
think about that for a second?

51:04.295 --> 51:06.896
- The first place we
fucked, really Ben?

51:06.897 --> 51:08.432
I mean, sincerely romantic.

51:08.433 --> 51:12.236
Genius stuff there,
man, let me tell you.

51:12.237 --> 51:13.437
- I'm hungry.

51:13.438 --> 51:15.372
- Can't you say first date?

51:15.373 --> 51:19.544
I mean, say somethin', we are
trying to get the jobs, right?

51:20.945 --> 51:21.912
- Did you hear what I said?

51:21.913 --> 51:23.480
I said I'm hungry.

51:23.481 --> 51:27.252
I mean, you can't even
carry that damn thing.

52:11.862 --> 52:13.697
- Gonna be an actress, yeah?

52:13.698 --> 52:16.032
- I don't wanna do
it anymore, Daddy.

52:16.033 --> 52:19.036
- You do what I say, you hear?

53:41.852 --> 53:42.687
- Yeah?

Motherfuckin' goddamn it!

54:54.525 --> 54:55.360
Fuck!

55:01.899 --> 55:04.834
- We're employed, convict.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.273
- I can't read this.

55:10.274 --> 55:12.041
Some of your waitresses
can't write English.

55:12.042 --> 55:13.843
I don't know what it is,
it's all in Spanish.

55:13.844 --> 55:15.679
So this is basically useless.

55:17.515 --> 55:18.449
- What the hell?

55:18.449 --> 55:19.249
Get the plates out of there.

55:19.250 --> 55:21.351
- There's your food.

55:21.352 --> 55:23.187
Another plate of food.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.589
- Hey, don't fuckin'
be eating the food.

55:25.590 --> 55:26.956
- Very good, I did a great job.

55:36.534 --> 55:39.203
- Yes, I see the Gulf of Mexico.

55:40.371 --> 55:42.439
- What the hell is
wrong with you?

55:46.411 --> 55:48.144
- What table is 14?

55:48.145 --> 55:48.979
Hi.

55:52.483 --> 55:54.818
Does any of this look familiar?

55:54.819 --> 55:58.688
- I didn't order
bacon, I had sausage.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.425
- Okay, that's, well.

56:03.661 --> 56:06.329
- Oh, you're tellin'
me to shut up?

56:06.330 --> 56:08.665
Oh, I got that, look at that.

56:13.771 --> 56:15.539
Blood Mary, I don't see
any booze in this place.

56:15.540 --> 56:16.740
Where am I gonna
get a Bloody Mary?

56:16.741 --> 56:18.007
You got booze back there?

56:18.008 --> 56:19.476
I know he's drunk as a lord.

56:19.477 --> 56:20.710
I know he is.

56:20.711 --> 56:24.781
- Okay, well, why don't
you have bacon today?

56:24.782 --> 56:27.050
- You're kidding right.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.552
- You can finish that.

56:28.553 --> 56:29.887
That looks good.

56:32.990 --> 56:34.624
Everybody shut up!

56:34.625 --> 56:36.060
What table is 14?

57:01.952 --> 57:05.122
- I didn't understand
a word you said.

57:10.895 --> 57:11.896
- It's hard.

57:13.798 --> 57:14.632
- Yep.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.702
- This job thing.

57:20.370 --> 57:21.872
- Bank was easier.

57:25.209 --> 57:29.046
- Suckin' off a black
cock was less demandin'.

57:33.183 --> 57:35.019
- You suck black cock?

57:35.853 --> 57:36.854
- Yeah, why?

57:40.858 --> 57:42.259
- Just wondering.

57:48.633 --> 57:50.467
You ready to get back?

57:52.703 --> 57:54.403
- What would be the worst
thing that would happen

57:54.404 --> 57:55.405
if I didn't?

57:57.474 --> 58:01.277
- You wouldn't find
that missing girl.

58:01.278 --> 58:03.848
Then kill ourselves afterwards.

58:06.551 --> 58:07.384
- Yeah.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.757
Good reason, partner,
good reason.

58:16.761 --> 58:18.695
- Lopez is a piece of
shit, I know that,

58:18.696 --> 58:19.829
but we have to work hard.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.497
Every day we have to work hard.

58:23.734 --> 58:25.168
What are you doing?

58:25.169 --> 58:28.873
I had an egg and bacon and
chicken and I had the potatoes.

58:32.142 --> 58:35.145
'Cause my name is
Julio the Mexican.

58:37.748 --> 58:38.683
Oh, enough.

58:41.986 --> 58:44.388
- Hey, you wanna play a game?

58:45.656 --> 58:47.157
- What, are we 10?

58:48.626 --> 58:51.060
- You ask a question, and
then I have to answer it

58:51.061 --> 58:53.129
with 10 seconds on the clock.
- What?

58:53.130 --> 58:54.631
- Back and forth.

58:54.632 --> 58:58.101
Has to be fast, otherwise
it's not fun, you know?

58:58.102 --> 58:59.502
- What, like anything?

58:59.503 --> 59:00.404
- Anything.

59:02.807 --> 59:03.808
- Where did?

59:06.476 --> 59:08.979
- Fine, okay, let me go first.

59:10.715 --> 59:11.548
Miss home?

59:12.683 --> 59:13.584
- New York?

59:15.385 --> 59:16.986
Yeah.

59:16.987 --> 59:21.158
If you had $10 million,
what would you do with it?

59:23.160 --> 59:26.163
- Move to Paris,
maybe further away.

59:27.665 --> 59:29.799
- Further away from what?

59:29.800 --> 59:32.637
- I don't know,
just further away.

59:33.537 --> 59:35.439
One question, remember?

59:36.540 --> 59:37.941
Did you love her?

59:37.942 --> 59:39.208
- Who?

59:39.209 --> 59:40.044
- Wifey.

59:41.178 --> 59:44.181
- What makes you
think I was married?

59:45.215 --> 59:47.316
I thought I loved them all.

59:47.317 --> 59:48.152
- Them?

59:50.287 --> 59:51.121
- Three.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.457
I thought they all loved
me until one of them

59:54.458 --> 59:55.793
cut off my ball.

59:56.627 --> 59:57.461
- What?

59:58.829 --> 01:00:02.866
- She cheated on me, so
I returned the favor.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:05.101
That was my first wife.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.536
Second and third, they just
thought it was some sort

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.238
of a birth defect.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.179
What happened to all the money?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.815
- Parents and
agents had a blast.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.684
- Well, how much did
they take, steal,

01:00:20.685 --> 01:00:22.952
or whatever you wanna call it?

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:25.690
- Seven films, two
million a pop,

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.893
minus 30 or so percent
for an agent.

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:30.828
I'd say 10.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.531
- 10 what?

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:36.666
- Million.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:37.501
- Ouch.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.637
- The American dream.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.642
- Well, on that note, I
am going to take a leak.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:03.592
What's that?

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.461
- What's what?

01:01:04.462 --> 01:01:06.195
- Those.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.198
- Open 'em and find out.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:13.738
- It's wrapped, wow.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.976
- I wanted to get 'em
for you, so I got 'em.

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.145
It felt right.

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:26.082
Finally spent money without all
the dirty baggage, you know?

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:26.917
Kill me.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.020
Sorry, that's a bad joke.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:32.823
- Oh, wow.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.293
- It's for your writin'.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:41.465
It's not real leather, but
it has that smell, you know?

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:48.337
This is not special
or much or anything,

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:51.776
it's just somethin'
that I know you need.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:57.446
It's prepaid, you're
gonna need it.

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.282
- Oh my.

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.492
What'd we agree on?

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:12.428
- Ben, you're gonna need
the phone in San Fran,

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:15.031
and the smokes and the
journal are just gifts

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:17.100
if you wanna call 'em that.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:20.736
From one partner to
another, that's it.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:24.307
- This is somethin' a friend
would give another friend.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:27.144
- What, partners
can't be friends?

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:46.897
- Fuck.

01:02:46.898 --> 01:02:48.131
- What?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.298
- What the fuck the
are you doin'?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.234
- Me?

01:02:50.235 --> 01:02:51.801
- You're allowin' me to do that.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:52.902
- What, are you testin' me?

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:54.770
- Yeah, maybe I am.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.239
- Fuck you.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.540
- What's with all this
fuckin' bitchin' and moanin'

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:58.741
like you're actually
fuckin' enjoyin' it.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.009
You can cut that
fuckin' horseshit out.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.077
You know, you're
not gettin' paid.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.511
- Wow.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.280
- If any of that kinda shit
fuckin' happens again,

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.515
I'm fuckin' out of here, okay?

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:08.185
Done, out, finished.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.691
- You can take the floor.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:30.506
- Can you pass me the journal
and the phone please?

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.341
- Get 'em yourself.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:33.742
- So does this mean
that I have to get you

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.011
something now too?

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.980
I mean, I'm beginning to
feel a little obligated.

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:38.948
- Suck your dick.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:41.618
- No, that's your gig, not mine.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.602
I'm goin' home, I retire,
I'm out of here.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:07.636

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:08.572

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.207
I don't care about your
fuckin' lunch time

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:12.708

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.077
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:15.811
The fuck you lookin' at?

01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:17.480
- Hey, leave that guy
alone and just go do

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.881
your fuckin' job, huh?

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:20.116
- I'm not doin' my fuckin'
job, motherfucker.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:21.350
I'm fuckin' leavin'.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.718
You fucked her back
there, didn't you?

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.053
You fucked her.
- Yeah, yeah that's right.

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:26.022
I fucked your fucking
girlfriend, so what?

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.890
What you gonna do
about it, puto?

01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:28.924
You know you're a real
cocksucker, you know that?

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.126
- What's this fuckin' bullshit?

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.494
Christmas, it's not
fuckin' Christmas here.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.928
It's 150 degrees outside.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.197
That's not fuckin' Christmas.

01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:36.432
It's 20 degrees below
right now in New York,

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:37.666
and I don't fuckin' care.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.935
- Go back to fuckin'
New York, asshole.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:43.606
You know, maybe I ought to
just call you Benjamin.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.942
I know about your shit, man.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.286
- He knew who we were, Ben.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.522
He knew about Bitches.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.057
We're all over the news.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.825
You know, they even got you
on camera shootin' that cop.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:07.430
Kaitlin is being covered 24/7,
otherwise it'd be our ass.

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:09.832
- We're just partners, Zelda.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:12.701
I don't give a shit what you do.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.937
Fuck anyone you want.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.472
Fuck that guy over there.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.573
How 'bout this guy over here?

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:19.675
Why don't you fuck him too?

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:23.013
I don't give a shit,
just don't fuck me.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:28.352
- Correct me if I'm wrong, Ben,
but I think you're jealous.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:33.490
- Well, I am correcting
you, you're wrong.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:38.328
Not that I give a shit,
but how many times?

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.164
- How many times what?

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:44.600
- How many times did
you fuck Lopez?

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:45.435
- Four.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.873
- Did you blow him?

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:52.775
- Well, yeah.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.043
- How many times, slut?

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.245
- Many times, okay?

01:06:56.246 --> 01:07:00.516
I sucked his load many times,
so many fuckin' times.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.819
Oh, he tasted so good, baby.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:08.357
How do you think we got the
fuckin' jobs, huh, our MBAs?

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.994
- We were gonna do good
like little boys and girls.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.263
That was all bullshit.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.700
Once a whore, always a whore.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.311
What are you doing down there?

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:29.612
That problem's not down
there, it's in here.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.547
- Oh, well thank you.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.916
I was checkin' for
an oil leak, Jesus.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.484
Thanks for the help.

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:39.089
- Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.492
You know how to fix
this thing, huh?

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:44.660
- Do you know how
to fix this thing?

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:45.495
- No.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:48.465
What's that smell?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.603
- It's manure.
- It's cow poop, yeah right?

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:57.140
- Yeah, exactly.
- And somethin' else.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:58.308
Shoo, go back.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:04.181
Come on, hurry up, the cow's
gonna charge in about a minute.

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:15.057
Oh, I think you got it
now, that looks good.

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:17.660
Well, try that thing over there.

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.127
That thing that looks
like a garden hose.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.595
Just wiggle it.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:24.468
And you go in and you pump the
throttle like that, right?

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:27.237
What are you lookin' at me for?

01:08:27.238 --> 01:08:28.404
You got any better ideas?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.971
- You know what, let's
try it your way.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.207
- Well, it says ecoboost,
so you give it a boost.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:33.509
- Yeah, yep.

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:42.718
- What are you doin'
in there, juicer?

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.987
Come over here.

01:08:45.389 --> 01:08:47.791
Shake your ass, come in here.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:51.126
- What writers do you like?

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.961
- What writers do you like?

01:08:55.999 --> 01:09:00.569
- Stop, stop makin' me
feel stupid all the time.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.005
I'm not dumb, you know.

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:05.107
I fixed the car, didn't I?

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:07.109
- Yes, you did, my dear.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.448
Rose Lathrop.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.286
- No fuckin' clue.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.055
- I bet you didn't have a clue.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:25.161
Daughter of Hawthorne.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:33.935
- Give it to me.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:35.470
- No, come on.
- No, let me see it, come on.

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.305
- No.
- Let me see it.

01:09:36.307 --> 01:09:37.907
Just let me see it.

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:50.487
Come on, let me see it, please.

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.721
- I haven't written anything.

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:54.558
Oh my.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.628
- Please, cop killer, please.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.163
- Hey, come on, come on.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:03.031
Come on, stop it.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.268
- You shot him, right?

01:10:05.269 --> 01:10:08.938
- Cut it out, you know
I didn't kill anyone.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.577
You know, I think you're
enjoyin' this highway too much.

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.680
- Let me see the journal.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:20.883
- Here, go ahead,
knock yourself out.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.151
- Oh.
- Take it.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.580
- It was far out.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.752
No, I mean it.

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:01.023
I mean you're a great writer.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:01.858
- Yeah.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:08.432
- I didn't know you
were writin' about us.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.935
- What's with the getup?

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.371
- My lucky dress.

01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:22.277
You know, I was goin'
through our cash flow,

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.247
and I think we have enough
to get started tomorrow.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:29.419
Meet up with Jennie, get the
details of the whereabouts.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:41.197
I'm sorry for what I
said about the cop.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:45.168
- Aw, well.
- It was a stupid joke,

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:48.004
and I'm sorry.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.375
You didn't kill him, Ben.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.479
You know we never.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:04.821
We never talked about how
we would do it, you know?

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:10.627
I want you to shoot
me in this dress.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.166
I wanna go wearin' this dress.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.904
- I wanna kill myself.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:23.873
I don't wanna kill you,

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:29.278
but if that's the way it's
supposed to be, then so be it.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:38.955
- It means you would've killed
somebody, you realize that.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.030
What really happened
back there with Lopez?

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:52.735
- The thought of another
guy inside you bothers me,

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:55.338
so I guess I'm having feelings.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:13:00.076
But nothing can come from them.

01:13:01.578 --> 01:13:04.480
So let's just keep our distance.

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:07.149
Let's get this over with.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:10.253
We got the dough,
we're almost there.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.157
I mean, look at you.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:22.331
- I want you to make love
to me in this dress.

- She was a goddamn
coward, yet so was I.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.353
- Z.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.672
- Will you stop that please?

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:53.842
- So like why are
we out here again?

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:55.543
- Z. and your woman
need to talk.

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:59.615
- I don't know, man, that
sounds secretive to me.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:05.288
I usually don't sit in a car
like this unless it's moving.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:08.623
- How old are you?

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.458
- 22, man.

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:13.662
- And what do you do all day?

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.030
- What, like on a regular day?

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:16.464
- Yeah.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:20.169
- You know, play some
PlayStation, smoke a doobie.

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:26.475
Why, do I come off as dumb?

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:31.446
People at school used
to say I was dumb.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.949
I like to write little
poems and stuff like that.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.618
I do it for Jennie, man.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.120
She thinks they're nice,
but I don't know,

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.388
I think she's jerkin' me off.

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:42.657
I mean, not literally.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:46.830
I mean, like she does, but not
while she's readin' my poems.

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:53.736
- You ever heard
of Rose Lathrop?

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:55.671
- Hawthorne's daughter.

01:17:56.539 --> 01:17:58.474
Yeah, that's dope, man.

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:01.544
That's dope.

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:09.551
- Okay, they call me
when they need something

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.954
from the outside or somethin'.

01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:14.056
They said they'd keep my head
attached if I help them,

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:15.657
so I have to.

01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:18.426
- Okay, wait, what
do you mean outside?

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.996
- Ever since they kidnapped
Kaitlin, forget it.

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:23.365
They're scared to show
their fuckin' faces.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:26.434
They were almost done in L.A.
a couple weeks ago.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.337
Really freaked 'em out.

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:32.174
So I told 'em they
could come up here.

01:18:32.175 --> 01:18:34.778
Only place I was familiar with.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:45.054
- Where are they stayin'?

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:57.933
- Chinatown, but I really
don't think you should

01:18:57.934 --> 01:18:59.234
go down there, Z.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.003
They'll kill you like
they did the others.

01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:04.172
- I know what I'm doing.
- You think I'm stupid, Z?

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:05.608
I know who he is.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.243
- Who?

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.980
- It's all online, he
killed that L.A. cop.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:13.448
- Wait, what do you mean killed?

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:15.483
- And the cops are after you,
too, for killing Bitches.

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.152
And don't think The
Band doesn't know.

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:20.755
- J., back up, where did
you hear Ben killed a cop?

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.591
- Don't you go online?

01:19:24.828 --> 01:19:25.829
- Guess not.

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:30.233
- Both of you are viral.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.737
I'm comin' with you.

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:36.872
- Shut up.
- No, I am, Z.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:38.340
- What's wrong with you, Jen?

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:39.875
Why do you want to get
wrapped up into this shit?

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:41.143
You just need to get away.

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:44.213
You and Dan need to
stay the fuck away.

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:49.284
- You know, I don't mean to
speak to you like this or

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:53.456
nothin', Z., but you should
kinda practice what you preach.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.234
- Yo, Daddy, are we there yet?

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:17.513
Wait, seriously though,
where are we going?

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.055
- So which is it?

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:30.792
- It's that one right there.

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:32.060
I'm almost positive.

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.029
- Almost?

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:34.696
- Jen, yay or nay?

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:36.798
- Yeah, yeah that's
the pit for sure.

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:37.766
- Is that where we're eating?

01:20:37.767 --> 01:20:40.102
- Like in the back or somethin'?

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:40.937
- Yeah.

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:49.478
- Ready?

01:20:50.813 --> 01:20:53.048
- Keep your phone on.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:54.884
Text me if it's dirty.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:56.752
- I'm goin' with you.

01:20:56.753 --> 01:20:58.753
- God, enough, Jen.

01:20:58.754 --> 01:21:01.957
Why don't you and Dan go
for a walk or somethin'?

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.258
- Here?

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.492
- And while you're at it,

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:05.994
why don't you fill
Dan in a little?

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:07.330
What do you say?

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:31.620
Am I no longer Zelda, the
once-upon-a-time starlet?

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:37.325
- What'd you tell 'em your
name was when you called them?

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:38.494
- Wolf Mother.

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:42.932
Every actress has to
have a stage name.

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:54.443
- Hey, Z?

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:56.545
- Yeah?

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.017
What?

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.287
- I'm gonna have the phone.

01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:08.024
- Groovy.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.440
The next 40 minutes

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.277
will be the longest
40 of my life.

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:33.515
- I heard y'all
like the bad girls.

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:34.882
You are the Wolf Mother

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:36.285
he talking about.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.787
- You're sittin with a bitch
who's my fuckin' woman.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.990
Take your fuckin' hands off
her, do you understand?

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:44.292
What the fuck was that
teen twit talkin' about?

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.094
She coulda gotten
us fucking killed.

01:22:46.095 --> 01:22:48.998
- What would it
have mattered, Ben?

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:00.175
Hurry up, get in the car.

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:01.477
Come on, get in.

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:12.387
- Why did we park in the back?

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:16.758
- If there's a God in heaven,
please don't speak okay?

01:23:16.759 --> 01:23:17.792
- Okay, man.
- Promise me?

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:19.362
- Okay, yeah.

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:38.646
- You don't know who
these people are

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:39.981
and you bring 'em to
my fuckin' house.

01:23:39.982 --> 01:23:43.785
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not doin' this shit!

01:23:43.786 --> 01:23:44.919
- Okay.
- I'm not doin' this.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.121
- Alright.
- You don't know who

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:47.389
these people are? - No, I don't.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:48.324
- You bring 'em to
my fuckin' house?

01:23:48.325 --> 01:23:49.824
Come on, I'm your brother.

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:51.226
Why would you fuckin' put me
in this kind of situation?

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:52.227
I live here.

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.595
It's my wife and my baby.

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:54.996
You're fucking shitting me.

01:23:54.997 --> 01:23:56.098
You don't know these
people do you?

01:23:56.099 --> 01:23:57.832
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:00.001
- I'm asking you to
do one favor for me.

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:01.703
Just one favor, okay?

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:04.939
Just let me stay the
night, please Jon.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.710
- Okay listen,
Ben, listen to me.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:10.512
Listen to me.

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:12.780
You can't stay here.

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:16.785
You can stay the night,
but you can't stay here.

01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:24.092
- I'm sorry I'm such an
embarrassment for you, Jon.

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:26.060
- You knew it wasn't the joint.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:29.131
You knew it, and you
sent us in there anyway.

01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:31.033
Look at me, Goddamn it.

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:35.471
Do you really wanna be me?

01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:38.541
- I'm just afraid.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.286
- Okay, I told you
if you'd tell us

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:55.323
where the fuck they are, we're
gonna take care of this.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:56.259
You hear me?

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.392
Then you can go on.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.962
Then you can move on from this.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.699
Why did you send
us to Chinatown?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.134
They're gonna kill us

01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:07.235
if you don't help us
fuckin' get to them first.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:09.003
Fucking tell me!

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:10.772
You could've killed us
by sendin' us there.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:13.141
How many more are
gonna have to die?

01:25:13.142 --> 01:25:14.076
- You're like family.

01:25:14.077 --> 01:25:16.111
You're a sister to me, Z.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.949
I just didn't want
anything to happen to you.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.223
- You know where they are.

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:35.231
And you're gonna tell me
everything this time.

01:25:36.899 --> 01:25:37.733
- Yeah.

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:41.169
- Cindy's freakin' out.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.870
You're all over the
fuckin' news, man.

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.440
You and that slut actress
friend of yours.

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:47.375
I'm not havin' this.

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:48.710
Not in this house.

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.111
Not with Cindy and the baby.

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:51.979
Not now, okay?

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.250
Do you know what would happen
to my career if anybody

01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:59.521
found out I was harboring a
fuckin' murderer in my home

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:00.555
with my family?

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:01.856
And my brother no less?

01:26:01.857 --> 01:26:04.091
Come on, I have a life.

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:07.629
I have a career I
have to preserve.

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.364
- Who you callin'
a murderer, Jon?

01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.065
I never... - And a cop.

01:26:11.066 --> 01:26:13.000
A goddamn cop to top it all off.

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:16.839
- Ben, I need to chit-chat
with you for a sec.

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:23.345
- You're shitting me.

01:26:23.346 --> 01:26:25.146
What is is non sequitor
shit with these people?

01:26:25.147 --> 01:26:28.015
This some kinda fuckin'
language, huh?

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.251
I need to chat with
you for a second.

01:26:29.252 --> 01:26:30.118
What does that mean,
blow up the house?

01:26:30.119 --> 01:26:31.353
- Turn it up.

01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:32.288
- Why don't you fuck
yourself, alright?

01:26:32.289 --> 01:26:33.821
Do it yourself from now on.

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.323
- You're watching a press
conference being held

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.925
by the San Francisco police
department with Kaitlin Miller

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:40.295
and her grandmother
Janice Letch.

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:43.765
The child star was found alone
in the tenderloin district.

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:46.601
What police also confirmed
is that Kaitlin's mother,

01:26:46.602 --> 01:26:48.870
Donna Miller, was behind
the abduction in what is

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:51.205
now believed to be a part
of a larger plan involving

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.575
sex trafficking of minors.

01:26:53.576 --> 01:26:56.478
Questions are now being
raised if this entire scheme

01:26:56.479 --> 01:27:00.014
was a publicity stunt by
the girl's own mother.

01:27:00.015 --> 01:27:02.183
Donna Miller is in custody
and has given the names

01:27:02.184 --> 01:27:04.419
of the remaining members
of The Band at large.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.855
Ivan Wexler and Maria Abramov
and others yet unidentified

01:27:07.856 --> 01:27:10.157
with The Band are
on their way north.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:13.194
Residents have been warned
that the suspects are at large

01:27:13.195 --> 01:27:15.397
and are dangerous. - Ben.

01:27:15.398 --> 01:27:19.568
- I know I'm not you, and
I know I'll never be you.

01:27:22.538 --> 01:27:25.473
I've made mistakes,
and I admit that.

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:28.109
But I'm here to do good now.

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.780
- You kill a cop, and
now you wanna do good?

01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:38.553
Hey, look, I don't wanna be
the harbinger of bad news,

01:27:38.554 --> 01:27:42.725
but there are some things in
life that you can't take back,

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:48.163
that are not reversible, and
I would think that taking

01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:53.168
the life of an innocent
person would be one of 'em.

01:27:56.539 --> 01:27:59.273
- I believe you might
be right, Jon.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:01.676
- Jon.
- Hey, stay out of it alright?

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:02.645
Don't say my name either.

01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:03.546
It's a family matter.

01:28:03.547 --> 01:28:05.212
Shut your fuckin' mouth.

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.748
It's probably because of
you he's in this situation

01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:08.916
he's in with this
murdered pimp of yours.

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:10.452
So just shut the fuck up, okay?

01:28:10.453 --> 01:28:11.986
Back up, bitch.

01:28:11.987 --> 01:28:15.257
Ben, you're my brother,
and I love you.

01:28:17.259 --> 01:28:19.060
- You still hunt?

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:19.895
- What?

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:24.467
- I never wanted to
hurt a soul, ever, Jon.

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:45.053
- What's wrong, baby?

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:52.327
Baby, did I do something?

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:55.498
- No, it's not you.

01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:01.870
- Can I help?

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.374
Can I do anything?

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.944
- Just leave me alone.

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:30.899
- I love you, Jennie.

01:29:37.573 --> 01:29:39.974
- They're on to you, Ben.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.976
You're not gonna make it.

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:43.845
I mean, look at you.

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:45.580
You look sick.

01:29:45.581 --> 01:29:46.948
- He's fine.

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:49.885
- Are you as dumb
as you look, huh?

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:53.855
I think maybe you are.

01:29:53.856 --> 01:29:56.558
You're one dumb fuckin'
bitch, did you know that?

01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:57.526
I guess hell was
built for two, huh?

01:29:57.526 --> 01:29:58.360
- Hey, Jon.

01:29:58.361 --> 01:29:59.594
- What?

01:29:59.595 --> 01:30:00.862
- You talk to Z. like
that one more time,

01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:02.730
I'm gonna knock you into
the middle of next week.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.198
- What, are you
gonna shoot me too?

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:06.434
Fuck you and fuck this
whore right here, alright?

01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:09.604
- Have you ever heard the
expression the man who believes

01:30:09.605 --> 01:30:12.039
he knows everything is the
man who learns nothing?

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:12.875
- Yeah, I fucked him in the ass.

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:14.543
Oh fuck!

01:30:16.378 --> 01:30:18.279
This is not really good.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.681
Really fuckin' good for me!

01:30:19.682 --> 01:30:21.348
- Kill the lights.
- What?

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.051
- Come out the front
door with your hands up.

01:30:24.052 --> 01:30:24.987
- Ben, they're gettin' out.

01:30:24.988 --> 01:30:27.122
They're coming to the door.

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:31.793
- They're gonna kill us, Jon.

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:33.661
- Cindy, honey,
what are you doin'?

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:35.963
Put the gun down.
- They'll kill all of us.

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:37.231
- Hey, goddamn it, listen to me.

01:30:37.232 --> 01:30:38.700
Put the gun down.

01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:40.267
- They're gonna kill the baby.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.636
- We have nothin' to
do with this shit.

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:42.904
- We're not gonna kill anyone.
- No, they're not.

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:44.305
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, look at me.

01:30:44.306 --> 01:30:45.607
Cindy, look at me.
- We're not gonna hurt you.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:46.808
Cindy, just put down the gun.
- Look at me.

01:30:46.809 --> 01:30:48.476
Listen to me, put the gun down.

01:30:48.477 --> 01:30:49.311
- I'm gonna shoot.

01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:01.389
- No!

01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:05.359
- Don't, Jon, stop!

01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:12.635
- Let me help you, Jon.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:15.737
- We have to go.

01:31:15.738 --> 01:31:17.438
Ben, we have to go.

01:31:17.439 --> 01:31:18.806
- Gimme the gun!
- Let's go, Ben.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.341
Let's go, we have to go.
- Please gimme the gun!

01:31:20.342 --> 01:31:23.846
Please!

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.914
Gimme the gun!

01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:27.181
Gimme the fucking gun!

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:30.685
- No, no!

01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:31.686
No, no, no.

01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:44.298
- Freeze!
- Get in the car!

01:31:44.299 --> 01:31:46.901
Get in the fuckin'
car, Zelda, now!

01:31:46.902 --> 01:31:49.270
Get down, get down,
get on your knees.

01:31:49.271 --> 01:31:51.206
- Ben, come on.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:09.992
Faster, Ben, go faster.

01:32:15.097 --> 01:32:16.698
Watch out!

01:32:20.703 --> 01:32:21.670
Oh my God.

01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:24.739
Oh my God, Ben, are you okay?

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:55.803
Kaitlin was found, okay?

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:57.371
It's over, done.

01:32:57.372 --> 01:32:58.973
- Ow!

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:00.743
Pull it, pull it hard.

01:33:01.777 --> 01:33:03.745
Now lift I up a little bit.

01:33:03.746 --> 01:33:04.913
Pull it, okay.

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.359
- Yeah, I had a baby girl.

01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:36.805
Her father was a John.

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:10.572
She was my happy little
girl, and I aborted her.

01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:45.440
I'm a murderer of innocents too.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:58.686
- What now?

01:36:06.661 --> 01:36:08.396
- Let me finish this.

01:39:00.068 --> 01:39:02.937
- You don't look
like no detective.

01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:09.644
- We have reason to
believe people involved,

01:39:14.016 --> 01:39:17.352
I believe they call
themselves The Band,

01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:23.925
have found shelter here.

01:39:28.563 --> 01:39:32.734
- You actually look like one
of those picture stars.

01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:42.177
- I'd be lyin' if I said
I didn't get that a lot.

01:39:44.846 --> 01:39:49.017
You have heard of the Kaitlin
Miller abduction though, yeah?

01:39:51.586 --> 01:39:54.522
- You don't hear
about things here.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:59.161
- But you know of it, right?

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.864
- I may.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:08.236
- I have a soft spot.

01:40:12.774 --> 01:40:15.277
See, I had a little girl once.

01:40:17.245 --> 01:40:20.515
Smallest little thing
you ever did see.

01:40:23.218 --> 01:40:25.220
She's no longer with us.

01:41:16.304 --> 01:41:18.839
- Everything A-okay there?

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.909
- Yeah, just gettin' through
the days, you know.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:25.079
You know how it is, right?

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:31.818
- Looks like you
need a new uniform.

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:34.555
What, you fall in the
bay or somethin'?

01:41:34.556 --> 01:41:35.390
- No.

01:41:37.159 --> 01:41:39.860
- What are you
doin' around here?

01:41:39.861 --> 01:41:41.061
- Just waitin' on somebody.

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:42.596
- Mr. Wilkinson.

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:43.431
- Yes.

01:41:44.566 --> 01:41:47.501
- Do you believe good
people are capable

01:41:47.502 --> 01:41:49.171
of doin' bad things?

01:41:55.977 --> 01:41:59.814
Let's say Kaitlin Miller
was your little girl.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:06.621
Let's just say that.

01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:12.460
And the people behind the
kidnappin' came forward.

01:42:13.895 --> 01:42:17.665
If they came forward and
asked you for Forgiveness,

01:42:22.504 --> 01:42:25.006
would you accept that apology?

01:42:27.442 --> 01:42:29.877
- What happened to your hand?

01:42:33.648 --> 01:42:36.918
You gotta stop using
yourself for bait.

01:42:38.786 --> 01:42:41.121
- Yeah, I bet the fishing's
good around here.

01:42:41.122 --> 01:42:43.089
- It's not bad.

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:46.460
You're not from
around here, are you?

01:42:46.461 --> 01:42:50.297
You gotta get a heavier jacket,
the wind will kill ya.

01:42:50.298 --> 01:42:51.799
- Oh, I bet, yeah.

01:42:53.034 --> 01:42:55.936
- Why would you ask me that?

01:42:55.937 --> 01:42:59.106
- 'Cause I'm tryin'
to forgive myself,

01:43:05.813 --> 01:43:09.717
but more importantly I'm
tryin' to forgive you.

01:43:14.722 --> 01:43:18.326
I'm really tryin' very
hard to forgive you,

01:43:22.163 --> 01:43:23.164
but I can't.

01:43:27.502 --> 01:43:29.671
- I want you to leave now.

01:43:32.974 --> 01:43:36.811
- What I'm sayin' is I'm
tryin' to forgive you

01:43:41.283 --> 01:43:45.387
for everything you've done
to this innocent girl.

01:43:50.325 --> 01:43:51.826
And you know what?

01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:55.630
I can't, I can't do it.

01:43:57.799 --> 01:43:59.200
I can't, I can't.

01:44:03.371 --> 01:44:06.274
- I believe I may
know who you are.

01:44:20.655 --> 01:44:24.326
- What are you gonna do,
man, call the cops?

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:37.038
- Seen these two
beauties anywhere?

01:44:41.142 --> 01:44:43.645
- No, I can't say I have, sir.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.149
- Alright, well, thank you.

01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:50.751
What's your name?

01:44:50.752 --> 01:44:52.319
- Terry.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.020
- Well, thanks for
your time, Terry.

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:57.257
You tell Mr. Wilkinson
that I said hi, huh?

01:44:57.258 --> 01:44:58.992
- I'll tell him, yeah.

01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:01.762
- And tell him we missed him
at the poker game last night.

01:45:01.763 --> 01:45:03.263
Usually robs us blind at poker.

01:45:03.264 --> 01:45:06.767
- That's why I don't
play with him anymore.

01:45:06.768 --> 01:45:09.169
Have a nice day, sir.

01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:11.339
- Yeah, you too.

01:47:23.471 --> 01:47:25.973
- Put the queen on the throne.

01:47:27.842 --> 01:47:30.177
Oh my God, you're so pretty.

01:47:54.502 --> 01:47:55.336
- Oh, hi.

01:49:42.744 --> 01:49:44.178
- We're not them.

01:49:46.547 --> 01:49:47.381
- No.

01:49:53.254 --> 01:49:55.422
- I can't do it to myself.

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:00.094
I need you to do it to me.

01:50:04.866 --> 01:50:06.868
One week I've been pure.

01:50:18.512 --> 01:50:19.780
- I'm sorry.

01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:21.215
I'm sorry, Zelda.

01:50:26.654 --> 01:50:27.822
I can't do it.

01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:30.924
I can't do it.

01:50:30.925 --> 01:50:31.793
I'm sorry, not you.

01:50:31.794 --> 01:50:32.960
I can't do it.

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:38.232
I just wanna make
things alright.

01:50:40.835 --> 01:50:43.604
I just wanna make
things alright.

01:51:05.292 --> 01:51:06.193
- Screw it.

01:51:07.929 --> 01:51:09.764
- Yeah, screw it then.

01:51:14.736 --> 01:51:15.569
- Chill.

01:51:16.771 --> 01:51:17.939
- Yeah, chill.

01:52:12.493 --> 01:52:16.997
- In death or life,
our love can only go.

01:52:16.998 --> 01:52:19.966
Never forgotten is
the joy we know.

01:52:19.967 --> 01:52:23.003
We follow memory
when life is gone.

01:52:23.004 --> 01:52:26.607

the tides that flow.
