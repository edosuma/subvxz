WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:31.633 --> 00:32.666
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

00:32.733 --> 00:33.933
WHICH I'VE NICKNAMED

00:34.033 --> 00:35.033
"HENRY KISSINGER" BECAUSE

00:35.100 --> 00:36.366
IT'S WHITE, DEEPLY UNPLEASANT,

AND AT THIS POINT,

00:37.333 --> 00:38.666
I'M JUST MAD IT'S STILL AROUND.

DOMINIC CUMMINGS.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.566
THE DEPUTY CABINET SECRETARY --

01:40.633 --> 01:42.300
SHE WALKED INTO THE OFFICE.

FUCKED."

02:12.266 --> 02:13.700
YOU DO NOT EXPECT TO HEAR AN

02:13.766 --> 02:14.433
ASSESSMENT THAT GRIM UNLESS

02:14.500 --> 02:16.700
IT'S FROM THE TEAM BEHIND

02:16.766 --> 02:17.100
THE FYRE FESTIVAL,

02:17.166 --> 02:18.533
OR WARNER BROTHERS DISCOVERY.

02:20.566 --> 02:22.333
JUST CHECKING IN TO SAY I LOVE

02:22.400 --> 02:23.000
THE CORPORATE LOGO YOU DROPPED

02:23.066 --> 02:24.300
THIS WEEK!

02:24.366 --> 02:25.766
IT LOOKS LIKE THE OPENING TITLE

02:25.833 --> 02:26.633
OF "THE SIMPSONS" IF THE FONT

02:26.700 --> 02:28.333
WERE NOT FOUND.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.833
AND QUICK NOTE: "THE STUFF THAT

02:29.900 --> 02:31.433
DREAMS ARE MADE OF" IS A QUOTE

02:31.500 --> 02:32.900
FROM "THE MALTESE FALCON," ABOUT

02:32.966 --> 02:34.100
HOW THE THING THAT SEEMED LIKE A

02:34.166 --> 02:35.300
PRICELESS TREASURE WAS ACTUALLY

02:35.366 --> 02:35.433
NO

02:35.500 --> 02:37.000
WORTHLESS GARBAGE THAT BROUGHT

02:37.066 --> 02:37.633
CHAOS AND DESPAIR TO EVERYONE

02:37.700 --> 02:38.233
AROUND IT.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.566
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK WITH THE

02:39.633 --> 02:40.700
MERGER, I'M SURE EVERYTHING'S

02:40.766 --> 02:42.400
GONNA GO GREAT!

02:42.466 --> 02:44.233
BUT THE TRUTH IS, AS BAD AS THE

02:44.300 --> 02:46.433
DETAILS OF CUMMINGS' TESTIMONY

02:46.500 --> 02:48.533
WERE, THE U.K.'S COVID RESPONSE

02:48.600 --> 02:55.200
PALES NEXT TO THAT OF

02:55.266 --> 02:56.366
BRAZIL'S.

02:56.433 --> 02:57.633
PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO HAS

02:57.700 --> 02:59.233
BEEN A SPECTACULAR FAILURE,

02:59.300 --> 03:00.000
WITH THE COUNTRY RECORDING

03:00.066 --> 03:01.766
OVER 1.9 MILLION NEW CASES

03:01.833 --> 03:02.433
IN THE PAST MONTH ALONE.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.033
AND BRAZILIANS ARE

03:04.100 --> 03:05.433
UNDERSTANDABLY FED UP,

03:05.500 --> 03:06.233
STAGING PROTESTS ACROSS

03:06.300 --> 03:07.900
THE COUNTRY THIS WEEK.

03:07.966 --> 03:08.700
>> DEMONSTRATORS WANT HIS

03:08.766 --> 03:09.800

03:09.866 --> 03:11.133
THE NEGLIGENCE IN PURCHASING

03:11.200 --> 03:12.066
VACCINES AFTER TRYING TO LEAD

03:12.133 --> 03:15.000
BRAZIL TOWARDS HERD IMMUNITY.

03:15.066 --> 03:15.133
NO

03:16.633 --> 03:18.166

03:18.233 --> 03:19.866
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST

03:19.933 --> 03:20.900
COUNTRY WITH THE WHOLE

03:21.000 --> 03:22.400
POPULATION VACCINATED.

03:22.466 --> 03:23.633
INSTEAD WE SEE SUCH

03:23.700 --> 03:25.833
IRRESPONSIBILITY.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.133
>> John: THAT WOMAN MAKES A

03:27.200 --> 03:28.900
GREAT POINT, DESPITE WEARING

03:28.966 --> 03:29.900
WHAT I ASSUME BIOLOGISTS USE TO

03:29.966 --> 03:31.133
DISGUISE THEMSELVES WHILE

03:31.200 --> 03:32.933
WATCHING CROCODILES FUCK.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.166
THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT IS IN

03:34.233 --> 03:35.300
THE MIDST OF AN INQUIRY INTO ITS

03:35.366 --> 03:36.733
OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND IT HAS

03:36.800 --> 03:38.100
UNCOVERED SOME BOMBSHELLS --

03:38.166 --> 03:39.833
INCLUDING THAT LAST AUGUST,

03:39.900 --> 03:41.500
PFIZER REPEATEDLY OFFERED

03:41.566 --> 03:42.733
BRAZIL'S HEALTH MINISTRY

03:42.800 --> 03:44.366
70 MILLION DOSES OF THE VACCINE

03:44.433 --> 03:45.700
IT WAS DEVELOPING, BUT THE

03:45.766 --> 03:48.300
COMPANY "GOT NO ANSWER."

03:48.366 --> 03:48.433
NO

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
AND COME ON, BRAZIL.

03:49.566 --> 03:50.366
YOU CAN'T GHOST PFIZER.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.666
THEY'RE A COMPANY THAT WAS

03:51.733 --> 03:52.566
OFFERING YOU A POTENTIALLY

03:52.633 --> 03:53.933
LIFESAVING VACCINE.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.066
NOT A FRUITARIAN

03:55.133 --> 03:56.700
ENTREPRENEUR-SLASH-POET YOU MET

03:56.766 --> 03:58.066
ON OKCUPID.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.333
IN THAT CASE, ABSOLUTELY HIT

03:59.400 --> 04:01.333
"IGNORE."

04:01.400 --> 04:02.833
AND THAT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE

04:02.900 --> 04:04.300
SURPRISING GIVEN HOW PUBLICLY

04:04.366 --> 04:05.400
DISMISSIVE BOLSONARO'S BEEN OF

04:05.466 --> 04:07.000
THE VACCINES.

04:07.066 --> 04:07.133
NO

04:07.200 --> 04:08.300
THAT WOMAN'S CROCODILE HAT

04:08.366 --> 04:09.666
WASN'T JUST SHOWCASING HER

04:09.733 --> 04:10.933
ABILITY TO SERVE LOOKS THAT

04:11.000 --> 04:11.233
NO

04:11.300 --> 04:12.133
ARE EXUBERANT WITHOUT BEING

04:12.200 --> 04:13.000
OBNOXIOUS.

04:13.066 --> 04:14.166
SHE WAS MAKING AN EXPLICIT

04:14.233 --> 04:15.766
REFERENCE TO A SHITTY JOKE

04:15.833 --> 04:17.333
BOLSONARO TOLD, ABOUT HOW

04:17.400 --> 04:18.066
COMPANIES WOULDN'T TAKE

04:18.133 --> 04:18.933
RESPONSIBILITY FOR VACCINE

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
SIDE EFFECTS.

04:22.066 --> 04:23.833
>> IF YOU TURN INTO A CROCODILE,

04:23.900 --> 04:25.166
IT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

04:25.233 --> 04:26.900
IF YOU TURN INTO SUPERMAN,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.200
IF A WOMAN GROWS A BEARD OR A

04:29.266 --> 04:30.100
MAN STARTS SPEAKING IN A HIGH

04:30.166 --> 04:31.066
VOICE, THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO

04:31.133 --> 04:33.433
WITH IT.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.966
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S ALL

04:35.033 --> 04:36.366
COMPLETE BULLSHIT, BUT IF I MAY

04:36.433 --> 04:37.433
JUST ADDRESS HIS INSINUATION

04:37.500 --> 04:38.233
THAT "IF THE VACCINE TURNS YOU

04:38.300 --> 04:38.833
INTO A CROCODILE, THAT'S YOUR

04:38.900 --> 04:39.500
PROBLEM."

04:39.566 --> 04:41.166
HONEY, NO.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.400
IF YOU TURN INTO A CROCODILE,

04:42.466 --> 04:44.000
IT'S YOUR SOLUTION.

04:44.066 --> 04:44.133
NO

04:44.200 --> 04:44.833
CROCODILES ARE INCREDIBLE

04:44.900 --> 04:46.033
SWIMMERS, THEY CAN SEE AT NIGHT,

04:46.100 --> 04:47.200
AND INSTEAD OF SWEATING THEY DO

04:47.266 --> 04:49.233
SOMETHING CALLED "MOUTH GAPING"

04:49.300 --> 04:53.200
THAT LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE THIS.

04:53.266 --> 04:54.366
AND THINK HOW MUCH EMBARRASSMENT

04:54.433 --> 04:55.000
THAT WOULD SAVE YOU

04:55.066 --> 04:56.266
ON A HOT DAY!

04:56.333 --> 04:56.866
NO PIT STAINS ON YOU, BUDDY.

04:56.933 --> 04:57.666
JUST MOUTH OPEN, DICK OUT,

04:57.733 --> 04:58.700
SWIMMING THROUGH LIFE

04:58.766 --> 04:59.700
WITHOUT A CARE.

04:59.766 --> 05:00.600
BECAUSE -- THANK FUCKING GOD --

05:00.666 --> 05:06.600
YOU'RE A CROCODILE.

05:06.666 --> 05:09.033
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THIS NEW

05:09.100 --> 05:10.866
INQUIRIES WITH BRAZIL'S DEATH

05:10.933 --> 05:13.633
RATES, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT

05:13.700 --> 05:14.833
57% OF BRAZILIANS BACK HIS

05:14.900 --> 05:15.400
IMPEACHMENT.

05:15.466 --> 05:17.266
NOT ONLY IS HE BACKING DOWN,

05:17.333 --> 05:20.433
JUST THIS WEEK, HE APPROVED THIS

05:20.500 --> 05:23.066
WEEK.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.766
>> THE COUNTRY WITH THE WORLD'S

05:24.833 --> 05:25.666
SECOND LARGEST COVID-19

05:25.733 --> 05:26.266
DEATH TOLL WILL HOST

05:26.333 --> 05:27.433
THE COPA AMERICA, WELCOMING

05:27.500 --> 05:28.033
SOUTH AMERICAN TEAMS FOR A

05:28.100 --> 05:31.666
FOUR-WEEK FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT.

05:31.733 --> 05:32.633
>> John: YEAH!

05:32.700 --> 05:33.633
BRAZIL IS SUDDENLY HOSTING A

05:33.700 --> 05:34.866
MASSIVE SOCCER TOURNAMENT ON

05:34.933 --> 05:35.900
JUST 13 DAYS' NOTICE.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.100
IT WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED

05:37.166 --> 05:37.866
TO BE IN ARGENTINA, BUT IT WAS

05:37.933 --> 05:38.800
CANCELED DUE TO COVID RATES.

05:38.866 --> 05:40.366
AND YET DESPITE THAT, BOLSONARO

05:40.433 --> 05:41.233
-- WHOSE COUNTRY'S RATES ARE

05:41.300 --> 05:42.333
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER -- IS NOW

05:42.400 --> 05:43.933
CHOOSING TO HOST A TOURNAMENT

05:44.000 --> 05:44.666
ONE SENATOR HAS DUBBED

05:44.733 --> 05:45.866
"THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF DEATH,"

05:45.933 --> 05:46.966
AND WHICH HAS INSPIRED MEMES

05:47.033 --> 05:48.133
LIKE THIS TO MAKE THE ROUNDS

05:48.200 --> 05:49.866
IN BRAZIL.

05:49.933 --> 05:50.966
AND I WILL SAY, THAT IS A PRETTY

05:51.033 --> 05:52.500
CHEERFUL LITTLE COFFIN.

05:52.566 --> 05:53.700
IT LOOKS LIKE CLIPPY THE

05:53.766 --> 05:54.600
PAPERCLIP POPPING UP TO ASK YOU,

05:54.666 --> 05:56.233
"IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO

05:56.300 --> 05:57.300
HOLD A SOCCER TOURNAMENT WHILE

05:57.366 --> 05:58.000
YOUR COUNTRY'S DEATH TOLL IS

05:58.066 --> 05:58.633
SKY HIGH.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.500
WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOT FUCKING

06:01.566 --> 06:01.766
DO THAT?"

06:01.833 --> 06:02.966
AND LOOK, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

06:03.033 --> 06:04.900
BRAZIL SHOULD BE A WARNING

06:04.966 --> 06:06.100
FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE IF VACCINE

06:06.166 --> 06:07.866
MISINFORMATION CONTINUES TO

06:07.933 --> 06:09.733
SPREAD, AND VARIANTS CONTINUE

06:09.800 --> 06:10.766
TO EMERGE, THE WHOLE WORLD COULD

06:10.833 --> 06:11.500
REMAIN IN TROUBLE FOR A VERY

06:11.566 --> 06:12.933
LONG TIME.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.766
IN FACT, DESPITE HOW

06:14.833 --> 06:16.766
COMPARATIVELY WELL THINGS SEEM

06:16.833 --> 06:17.800
TO BE GOING RIGHT NOW IN THE

06:17.866 --> 06:19.466
U.S., IF WE DON'T ACTIVELY HELP

06:19.533 --> 06:21.633
GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL

06:21.700 --> 06:22.900
GLOBALLY, THEN TO QUOTE A FORMER

06:22.966 --> 06:24.566
TOP U.K. OFFICIAL:

06:24.633 --> 06:26.000
>> I THINK WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

06:26.066 --> 06:26.533
FUCKED.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.733

10:08.566 --> 10:10.500
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE SOURCING.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.933

10:59.800 --> 11:01.633
THEIR EXPERIENCES GET ERASED.

11:10.366 --> 11:11.866
THE AMERICAN CULTURE.

RIDICULOUSLY LARGE AND DIVERSE

11:28.433 --> 11:31.066

11:31.133 --> 11:32.033
AND THERE IS CLEARLY NOT GOING

11:32.100 --> 11:32.833

11:32.900 --> 11:33.600

11:55.400 --> 11:56.533

11:56.600 --> 11:57.433
ACCIDENT -- IT WAS KIND OF

11:57.500 --> 11:58.533
THE POINT FROM THE START.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.533
BECAUSE IT WAS FIRST COINED IN

11:59.600 --> 12:00.733
THE LATE 1960s BY ASIAN-AMERICAN

12:00.800 --> 12:02.266
STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN CALIFORNIA,

12:02.333 --> 12:03.733
WHO WENT ON STRIKE ALONGSIDE

12:03.800 --> 12:05.466
BLACK, HISPANIC, AND

12:05.533 --> 12:06.966
NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS

12:07.033 --> 12:08.000
TO DEMAND AN ETHNIC STUDIES

12:08.066 --> 12:09.700
CURRICULUM.

12:09.766 --> 12:12.633

12:12.700 --> 12:13.700

12:13.766 --> 12:15.233
WE WERE ALL ORIENTALS.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.633
IN 1968, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME

12:17.700 --> 12:18.400
THAT I HEARD THE TERM

12:18.466 --> 12:20.566
ASIAN-AMERICANS.

12:20.633 --> 12:21.166
>> ASIAN-AMERICANS ENCOMPASSES

12:21.233 --> 12:22.333
EVERYBODY.

12:22.400 --> 12:22.933
I THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S

12:23.000 --> 12:24.566
SOMETHING.

12:24.633 --> 12:27.366
PEOPLE ARE FINALLY STARTING TO

12:27.433 --> 12:28.200
REALIZE THAT WE WEAR OUR RACE ON

12:28.266 --> 12:29.666
OUR FACE.

12:29.733 --> 12:30.733
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.066
UNDER A SYSTEM OF WHITE

12:32.133 --> 12:33.133
SUPREMACY, WE DO TEND TO

12:33.200 --> 12:34.933
WEAR OUR RACE ON OUR FACE.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.333
MY FACE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS

12:36.400 --> 12:37.633
CURRENTLY WEARING DOWN MARKET

12:37.700 --> 12:39.600
VINTAGE COLONIAL CASUAL.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.633
I'D CHANGE INTO SOMETHING A

12:41.700 --> 12:42.600
LITTLE LESS IMPERIAL IF I COULD,

12:42.666 --> 12:43.933
BUT I CAN'T, SO INSTEAD I WEAR

12:44.000 --> 12:45.866
THESE GLASSES.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.300
FOR THOSE ACTIVISTS, THE TERM

12:47.366 --> 12:50.233
"ASIAN-AMERICAN" WAS AN ATTEMPT

12:50.300 --> 12:50.933
TO UNITE A MASSIVELY DIFFUSE

12:51.000 --> 12:53.033
COMMUNITY IN SOLIDARITY, THUS

12:53.100 --> 12:54.533
INCREASING THEIR POWER, AND,

12:54.600 --> 12:55.966
CRUCIALLY, FORCING THEIR

12:56.033 --> 12:57.600
UNIVERSITIES TO DEVOTE RESOURCES

12:57.666 --> 13:00.500
TO MAKING SURE THE HISTORIES OF

13:00.566 --> 13:01.466
ALL THEIR COMMUNITIES WERE

13:01.533 --> 13:02.466
ACTUALLY TAUGHT.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.566
IT WAS A POLITICAL TERM, A

13:03.633 --> 13:04.866
RADICAL REDEFINITION AT THE

13:04.933 --> 13:06.100
TIME.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.700
BUT IT'S SINCE BECOME A COMMON

13:07.766 --> 13:08.666
SHORTHAND THAT CAN,

13:08.733 --> 13:12.100
UNFORTUNATELY, END UP BEING USED

13:12.166 --> 13:13.033
IN A WAY THAT IS FAR TOO

13:13.100 --> 13:13.600
REDUCTIVE AND SUPERFICIAL,

13:13.666 --> 13:14.466
TO THE POINT WHERE AN OLD

13:14.533 --> 13:15.700
GOVERNMENT PSA FELT THE NEED TO

13:15.766 --> 13:18.000
MAKE A PRETTY OBVIOUS STATEMENT.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.366
>> PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME HOW I

13:19.433 --> 13:21.300
LIKE AMERICA.

13:21.366 --> 13:22.333
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS BORN

13:22.400 --> 13:25.000
HERE.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.100
LIKE MOST AMERICANS, WE'VE BEEN

13:26.166 --> 13:27.666
AMERICAN FOR A LONG TIME.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.033
SOME OF US FOLLOW ASIAN

13:29.100 --> 13:30.566
TRADITION.

13:30.633 --> 13:33.266
MY FAMILY IS APPLE PIE AMERICAN.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.266
MINI BIKES, FOOTBALL,

13:34.333 --> 13:37.633
ROCK GUITAR.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.600
ALL ASIAN-AMERICANS ARE NO MORE

13:38.666 --> 13:40.366
ALIKE THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF

13:40.433 --> 13:42.200
AMERICAN.

13:42.266 --> 13:45.600
WE DON'T ALL LOOK ALIKE, DO WE?

13:45.666 --> 13:46.433
>> WELL, DO WE?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.700
>> John: THE FUCK?

13:48.766 --> 13:50.466
GOVERNMENT MONEY PAID FOR THAT?

13:50.533 --> 13:52.600
EVEN THIS KID HAS A SMIRK THAT

13:52.666 --> 13:54.866
SAYS "FUCKING WHITE PEOPLE."

13:54.933 --> 13:56.300
ALTHOUGH, I'LL ADMIT, THE WRITER

13:56.366 --> 13:57.366
OF THAT PSA DEFINING

13:57.433 --> 13:58.133
"APPLE PIE AMERICAN" AS

13:58.200 --> 13:59.600
"MINI BIKES, FOOTBALL,

13:59.666 --> 14:01.433
ROCK GUITAR" IS MAGNIFICENT.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.633
IT SHOULD BE THE OATH OF

14:02.700 --> 14:03.433
CITIZENSHIP.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.666
YOU PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR

14:04.733 --> 14:05.500
HEART, SAY "MINI BIKES,

14:05.566 --> 14:06.700
FOOTBALL, ROCK GUITAR,"

14:06.766 --> 14:07.933
AND THEN YOU NEVER RIDE

14:08.000 --> 14:08.500
A REGULAR-SIZED BIKE AGAIN.

14:08.566 --> 14:09.900
WHY?

14:09.966 --> 14:10.633
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN "AMERICAN"

14:10.700 --> 14:12.733
NOW.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.300
AND OBVIOUSLY, RECOGNIZING THE

14:14.366 --> 14:16.033
DIVERSITY OF ASIAN-AMERICANS IS

14:16.100 --> 14:18.166
ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN SIMPLY

14:18.233 --> 14:19.133
RECOGNIZING THOSE THREE CHILDREN

14:19.200 --> 14:20.500
HAVE THREE DIFFERENT FACES.

14:20.566 --> 14:21.566
BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN DANGERS

14:21.633 --> 14:23.166
OF TREATING ASIAN-AMERICANS

14:23.233 --> 14:24.933
AS A SINGLE ENTITY IS THAT IT

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
OBSCURES THE REALITY OF WHAT'S

14:27.066 --> 14:28.366
HAPPENING FOR THE DIFFERENT

14:28.433 --> 14:29.766
SUBGROUPS INSIDE IT.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.766
FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT 10% OF

14:31.833 --> 14:34.033
ASIAN-AMERICANS LIVE IN POVERTY,

14:34.100 --> 14:35.433
WHICH IS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THE

14:35.500 --> 14:36.700
OVERALL U.S. POVERTY RATE.

14:36.766 --> 14:38.266
BUT WHEN YOU DISAGGREGATE THE

14:38.333 --> 14:39.600
DATA -- WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN

14:39.666 --> 14:41.466
BY SUBGROUP -- YOU START TO SEE

14:41.533 --> 14:43.166
A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED

14:43.233 --> 14:44.566
SITUATION, WITH MONGOLIAN AND

14:44.633 --> 14:46.600
BURMESE-AMERICANS HAVING A

14:46.666 --> 14:48.233
POVERTY RATE OF 25%, MORE THAN

14:48.300 --> 14:50.466
TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.533
AND WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.733
WHILE AROUND 75% OF

14:53.800 --> 14:55.233
INDIAN-AMERICANS HAVE A

14:55.300 --> 14:57.000
BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- WELL ABOVE

14:57.066 --> 14:58.966
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- FOR

14:59.033 --> 15:00.566
BHUTANESE-AMERICANS, THAT FIGURE

15:00.633 --> 15:01.700
IS JUST 15%, WHICH IS WELL

15:01.766 --> 15:03.200
BELOW IT.

15:03.266 --> 15:05.366
THE POINT IS, DISAGGREGATING THE

15:05.433 --> 15:06.800
DATA CAN REVEAL BIG DISPARITIES

15:06.866 --> 15:08.500
YOU COULDN'T SEE PREVIOUSLY.

15:08.566 --> 15:10.366
LOOKING AT AVERAGES FOR

15:10.433 --> 15:12.100
ASIAN-AMERICANS AS A WHOLE IS

15:12.166 --> 15:13.766
LIKE LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE

15:13.833 --> 15:15.000
INCOME OF THE HEMSWORTH

15:15.066 --> 15:16.200
BROTHERS.

15:16.266 --> 15:17.800
IT'S VERY MISLEADING WHEN WE ALL

15:17.866 --> 15:19.433
KNOW SOME HEMS ARE WORTH A LOT

15:19.500 --> 15:21.266
MORE THAN OTHER HEMS ARE WORTH.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.966
AND LOOK, USING THE TERM

15:23.033 --> 15:24.533
"ASIAN-AMERICANS" TO REPRESENT

15:24.600 --> 15:26.233
A POLITICAL COALITION MADE

15:26.300 --> 15:27.733
SENSE, AND STILL DOES,

15:27.800 --> 15:29.300
TO SOME EXTENT.

15:29.366 --> 15:30.200
BUT A COALITION IS NOT A

15:30.266 --> 15:32.500
MONOLITH.

15:32.566 --> 15:33.900
AND TO START TO UNDERSTAND SOME

15:33.966 --> 15:36.100
OF THE PRESENT-DAY DIFFERENCES

15:36.166 --> 15:37.833
HERE, IT REALLY HELPS TO

15:37.900 --> 15:38.633
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES IN

15:38.700 --> 15:39.733
WHEN, AND HOW, PEOPLE CAME TO

15:39.800 --> 15:41.433
THIS COUNTRY.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.333
AND YOU CAN BREAK DOWN THOSE

15:42.400 --> 15:44.433
EXPERIENCES INTO A FEW BROAD

15:44.500 --> 15:47.500
CATEGORIES, STARTING WITH THOSE

15:47.566 --> 15:48.566
WHO ARRIVED EARLIER, IN THE

15:48.633 --> 15:49.533
19TH CENTURY AND THE FIRST HALF

15:49.600 --> 15:51.000
OF THE 20TH.

15:51.066 --> 15:52.300
ASIAN IMMIGRATION IN THAT TIME

15:52.366 --> 15:55.633
WAS ESSENTIALLY A CYCLE OF

15:55.700 --> 15:56.433
ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION FOLLOWED

15:56.500 --> 15:57.333
BY A VIOLENT AND RESTRICTIVE

15:57.400 --> 15:58.066
BACKLASH.

15:58.133 --> 15:59.766
THIS BEGAN WITH CHINESE

15:59.833 --> 16:00.966
IMMIGRANTS, WHO WERE RECRUITED

16:01.033 --> 16:01.766
TO WORK ON THE RAILROADS IN THE

16:01.833 --> 16:03.033
1860s.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.033
THEY FACED VIRULENT RACISM FROM

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
THE BEGINNING, BOTH FROM THEIR

16:06.566 --> 16:08.233
BOSSES, WHO SAW THEIR LIVES AS

16:08.300 --> 16:09.733
DISPOSABLE, AND FROM WHITES,

16:09.800 --> 16:11.133
MANY OF WHOM SAW THEM AS UNFAIR

16:11.200 --> 16:13.133
COMPETITION FOR JOBS.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.166
AT THE TIME, A SENATOR FROM

16:15.233 --> 16:16.800
CALIFORNIA DESCRIBED CHINESE

16:16.866 --> 16:18.866
IMMIGRANTS AS "AUTOMATIC ENGINES

16:18.933 --> 16:20.766
OF FLESH AND BLOOD" -- MAKING

16:20.833 --> 16:22.466
THEM SOUND LIKE RAILROAD-LAYING

16:22.533 --> 16:24.366
TERMINATORS -- AND DEMANDED THAT

16:24.433 --> 16:25.466
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

16:25.533 --> 16:26.933
"SECURE THE AMERICAN ANGLO-SAXON

16:27.000 --> 16:28.933
CIVILIZATION WITHOUT

16:29.000 --> 16:31.166
CONTAMINATION OR ADULTERATION."

16:31.233 --> 16:33.033
AND IN 1882, WITH THE CHINESE

16:33.100 --> 16:35.433
EXCLUSION ACT, HE GOT HIS WISH.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.900
>> THE CHINESE EXCLUSION LAW IS

16:36.966 --> 16:38.033
ONE OF THE FIRST REALLY

16:38.100 --> 16:38.666
COMPREHENSIVELY RESTRICTIVE

16:38.733 --> 16:41.666
LAWS.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.733
AND IT'S ALSO THE FIRST AND ONLY

16:43.800 --> 16:45.033
TIME IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF

16:45.100 --> 16:48.100
THE UNITED STATES THAT A GROUP

16:48.166 --> 16:50.800
IS SINGLED OUT BY NAME, CHINESE

16:50.866 --> 16:54.300
BY NAME AS BEING UNDESIRABLE.

16:54.366 --> 16:55.600
SO THIS IS TRULY A REMARKABLE

16:55.666 --> 16:56.233
MOMENT.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.700
>> John: YEP, THE POSTER SAYS

16:58.766 --> 17:00.966
"HIP HURRAH" TO THE CHINESE

17:01.033 --> 17:02.100
EXCLUSION ACT, AND IF YOU LOOK

17:02.166 --> 17:03.466
AT THE WHOLE THING, IT SAYS IN

17:03.533 --> 17:04.366
THE MIDDLE, "HIP HURRAH, THE

17:04.433 --> 17:05.600
WHITE MAN IS ON TOP."

17:05.666 --> 17:07.366
WHICH IS A BIT REDUNDANT.

17:07.433 --> 17:10.633
IF YOU'VE SAID "HIP HURRAH"

17:10.700 --> 17:11.566
TWICE, YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY

17:11.633 --> 17:12.300
"THE WHITE MAN IS ON TOP."

17:12.366 --> 17:13.700
IT'S LIKE SAYING

17:13.766 --> 17:15.500
"BLUE LIVES MATTER" OR "WELCOME

17:15.566 --> 17:17.200
TO CARRIE BRADSHAW'S BEDROOM."

17:17.266 --> 17:18.300
"THE WHITE MAN ON TOP" PART IS

17:18.366 --> 17:20.533
VERY MUCH IMPLIED.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.033
AND AMERICA COMMITTED TO THAT

17:22.100 --> 17:23.400
EXCLUSION POLICY.

17:23.466 --> 17:24.766
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT

17:24.833 --> 17:26.733
KNOW: THERE WERE ACTUALLY SIX

17:26.800 --> 17:28.833
CHINESE MEN WHO SURVIVED THE

17:28.900 --> 17:29.733
SINKING OF THE TITANIC, BUT UPON

17:29.800 --> 17:32.400
REACHING U.S. SHORES,

17:32.466 --> 17:32.933
WERE NOT PERMITTED TO ENTER

17:33.000 --> 17:35.200
THE UNITED STATES TO RECOVER.

17:35.266 --> 17:36.300
INSTEAD, THEY WERE FORCED ONTO

17:36.366 --> 17:37.500
ANOTHER BOAT AND SENT AWAY THE

17:37.566 --> 17:38.333
VERY NEXT DAY.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.533
WHICH ISN'T JUST RACIST,

17:39.600 --> 17:42.800
IT'S INSENSITIVE.

17:42.866 --> 17:43.733
DID IT REALLY HAVE TO BE ANOTHER

17:43.800 --> 17:44.633
BOAT?

17:44.700 --> 17:49.266
THEY HAD JUST BEEN ON THE BEST

17:49.333 --> 17:50.700
BOAT AND IT FUCKING SUCKED.

17:50.766 --> 17:51.533
COULD YOU NOT PUT THEM ON

17:51.600 --> 17:52.966
A ZEPPELIN OR SOMETHING?

17:53.033 --> 17:53.733
AT THE VERY LEAST, LET'S MIX UP

17:53.800 --> 17:54.866
THE DOOMED TURN OF THE CENTURY

17:54.933 --> 17:56.200
TRANSPORTATION METHODS HERE.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.266
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF CHINESE

17:57.333 --> 17:58.400
IMMIGRANTS UNFORTUNATELY SET

17:58.466 --> 17:59.466
THE TEMPLATE FOR THE DIFFERENT

17:59.533 --> 18:00.600
GROUPS THAT FOLLOWED.

18:00.666 --> 18:01.966
BECAUSE WAVES OF JAPANESE,

18:02.033 --> 18:03.633
KOREAN, SOUTH ASIAN, AND

18:03.700 --> 18:05.800
FILIPINO IMMIGRANTS LATER CAME

18:05.866 --> 18:07.500
OVER AS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS,

18:07.566 --> 18:08.533
WITH THOSE IN CHARGE OFTEN

18:08.600 --> 18:09.766
PITTING THE GROUPS AGAINST

18:09.833 --> 18:11.100
EACH OTHER WITH UNEQUAL WAGES

18:11.166 --> 18:13.100
AND TREATMENT.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.533
EACH GROUP THAT CAME FACED

18:14.600 --> 18:16.733
THE COMMON EXPERIENCE OF RACIAL

18:16.800 --> 18:17.800
HOSTILITY, VIOLENCE, AND LAWS

18:17.866 --> 18:19.133
DENYING THEM THE POSSIBILITY OF

18:19.200 --> 18:19.966
BECOMING CITIZENS OR OWNING

18:20.033 --> 18:22.966
LAND.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.066
HERE IS A POSTER TARGETING

18:24.133 --> 18:25.300
CHINESE PEOPLE, HERE'S A SIGN

18:25.366 --> 18:27.900
TARGETING JAPANESE PEOPLE, AND

18:27.966 --> 18:28.833
HERE IS ONE TARGETING FILIPINOS.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.400
IT'S JUST LIKE THE STATUE OF

18:30.466 --> 18:31.866
LIBERTY SAYS: "GIVE ME YOUR

18:31.933 --> 18:33.133
TIRED, YOUR POOR, YOUR HUDDLED

18:33.200 --> 18:33.400
MASSES...

18:33.466 --> 18:34.000
BUT NOT OVER THERE.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.100
NOT THERE EITHER.

18:35.166 --> 18:36.533
DEFINITELY NOT IN MAINE.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.333
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS JUST

18:37.400 --> 18:37.933
FIGURE IT OUT.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.633
DON'T WORRY, THE SIGNS WILL MAKE

18:38.700 --> 18:40.933
IT REALLY OBVIOUS."

18:41.000 --> 18:42.200
AND NO MATTER HOW LONG

18:42.266 --> 18:44.366
ASIAN-AMERICANS OR THEIR

18:44.433 --> 18:45.400
FAMILIES HAD BEEN IN THIS

18:45.466 --> 18:46.966
COUNTRY, THEY WERE, AS NOW,

18:47.033 --> 18:48.966
TREATED AS PERPETUAL FOREIGNERS

18:49.033 --> 18:50.033
WHOSE LOYALTIES WERE IN

18:50.100 --> 18:51.766
QUESTION, WITH THE MOST FAMOUS

18:51.833 --> 18:53.600
EXAMPLE OF THIS BEING

18:53.666 --> 18:54.466
THE WORLD WAR II

18:54.533 --> 18:56.433
INTERNMENT CAMPS, WHERE

18:56.500 --> 18:58.466
120,000 JAPANESE-AMERICANS

18:58.533 --> 18:59.300
WHO'D BEEN ROUNDED UP EN MASSE

18:59.366 --> 19:00.366
WERE IMPRISONED.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.400
AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY,

19:02.466 --> 19:03.566
WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY ALLOWED

19:03.633 --> 19:05.133
TO LEAVE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

19:05.200 --> 19:06.433
HAD THE GALL TO TRY AND GIVE IT

19:06.500 --> 19:08.133
A POSITIVE SPIN.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.533
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY

19:09.600 --> 19:10.500
ENOUGH TO GET TO YOUR NEW

19:10.566 --> 19:13.700
LOCATION, THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH

19:13.766 --> 19:15.566
W.R.A. WILL MAKE A GRANT OF

19:15.633 --> 19:16.466
ENOUGH MONEY TO GET YOU THERE

19:16.533 --> 19:17.800
AND A LITTLE EXTRA UNTIL

19:17.866 --> 19:18.966
THE PAYCHECKS START COMING IN.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.300
THIS MONEY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE

19:20.366 --> 19:21.166
REPAID.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.400
IT'S A HELPING HAND FROM

19:22.466 --> 19:25.133
UNCLE SAM.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.333
IT'S A BIG MOMENT WHEN YOU START

19:26.400 --> 19:28.600
TO PACK FOR YOUR TRIP OUTSIDE.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.300
IT'S AN EVEN BIGGER MOMENT

19:29.366 --> 19:30.366
WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE GATES,

19:30.433 --> 19:33.000
FOR THE LAST TIME.

19:33.066 --> 19:34.866
AND PRESENT YOUR PASS TO THE

19:34.933 --> 19:37.200
GUARD FOR THE LAST TIME.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.066
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE BARBED

19:39.133 --> 19:40.466
WIRE FENCE FOR THE LAST TIME.

19:40.533 --> 19:41.666
>> John: "AND AS YOU LOOK AT

19:41.733 --> 19:42.833
THAT BARBED WIRE, YOU CAN THINK

19:42.900 --> 19:44.466
"FUCK YOU, AMERICA" FOR THE LAST

19:44.533 --> 19:44.666
TIME.

19:44.733 --> 19:44.933
GO AHEAD.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.200
WE'RE COOL WITH IT.

19:46.266 --> 19:47.000
YOU CAN EVEN SAY IT OUT LOUD IF

19:47.066 --> 19:47.566
YOU WANT TO.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.600
WE'LL PRETEND WE DIDN'T HEAR

19:48.666 --> 19:50.833
YOU, AND THEN WE'LL BE EVEN.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.500
IN FACT, LET'S SHAKE ON THAT.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.433
YOU CAN SAY "FUCK YOU, AMERICA"

19:53.500 --> 19:55.900
ONE TIME, AND THEN WE'LL BE

19:55.966 --> 19:56.100
COOL."

19:56.166 --> 19:57.900
BUT AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE

19:57.966 --> 19:59.266
LAST CENTURY, ATTITUDES BEGAN TO

19:59.333 --> 20:00.466
SHIFT AS THE U.S. - LOCKED

20:00.533 --> 20:02.233
IN A COLD WAR -- CAME TO SEE

20:02.300 --> 20:03.833
EXCLUSION LAWS AND RACIAL QUOTAS

20:03.900 --> 20:05.333
AS BAD FOR ITS GLOBAL IMAGE.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.933
SO LAWS LIKE THE CHINESE

20:07.000 --> 20:08.566
EXCLUSION ACT WENT AWAY,

20:08.633 --> 20:10.466
TO EVENTUALLY BE REPLACED BY

20:10.533 --> 20:12.533
THE 1965 IMMIGRATION ACT.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.866
AND THIS IS THE NEXT BROAD

20:14.933 --> 20:16.166
CATEGORY OF ASIAN-AMERICAN

20:16.233 --> 20:17.600
IMMIGRANTS: THOSE WHO CAME

20:17.666 --> 20:18.766
POST-1965 AS A RESULT OF THAT

20:18.833 --> 20:20.500
ACT.

20:20.566 --> 20:22.200
BECAUSE IN CONTRAST TO THE

20:22.266 --> 20:24.133
PREVIOUS MIGRANTS, WHO WERE

20:24.200 --> 20:25.566
GENERALLY RELEGATED TO LOW-WAGE

20:25.633 --> 20:27.866
MANUAL LABOR, A KEY THING THIS

20:27.933 --> 20:29.033
LAW DID WAS PRIORITIZE EDUCATED

20:29.100 --> 20:31.266
AND HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS LIKE

20:31.333 --> 20:34.033
DOCTORS AND ENGINEERS.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.200
AND IT ALSO TRIED TO ADDRESS

20:35.266 --> 20:36.466
SPECIFIC LABOR NEEDS, LIKE WHEN

20:36.533 --> 20:38.233
A NURSING SHORTAGE RESULTED IN

20:38.300 --> 20:40.600
OVERSEAS ADS LIKE THESE.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.200
>> LABOR RECRUITERS AND TRAVEL

20:42.266 --> 20:43.366
AGENCIES STARTED TARGETING

20:43.433 --> 20:44.966
FILIPINO NURSES WITH ADS THAT

20:45.033 --> 20:45.700
PROMISED THEM BRIGHT FUTURES IN

20:45.766 --> 20:48.800
AMERICA.

20:48.866 --> 20:51.366
>> ONE PARTICULAR AD FEATURED A

20:51.433 --> 20:53.300
BASKET THAT WAS DECORATED WITH

20:53.366 --> 20:55.066
THE PHILIPPINE FLAG.

20:55.133 --> 20:58.333
IT'S ADDRESSING THE FILIPINO

20:58.400 --> 20:59.800
NURSE SAYING, "DEAR NURSE, IF

20:59.866 --> 21:01.500
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WHERE YOU ARE

21:01.566 --> 21:03.833
RIGHT NOW, CONTACT US."

21:03.900 --> 21:06.033
AND, "WE CAN'T PROMISE YOU

21:06.100 --> 21:06.666
HAPPINESS, BUT WE CAN HELP YOU

21:06.733 --> 21:10.500
CHASE IT ALL OVER THE PLACE."

21:10.566 --> 21:11.933
>> John: I'VE GOTTA SAY, THAT'S

21:12.000 --> 21:13.533
A REFRESHINGLY HONEST SLOGAN.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.266
"YOU MIGHT NOT CATCH HAPPINESS

21:14.333 --> 21:17.266
-- BUT YOU CAN CHASE IT!"

21:17.333 --> 21:18.733
AND IT SEEMED TO WORK, AS NURSES

21:18.800 --> 21:19.666
ARE ONE OF THIS COUNTRIES' TOP

21:19.733 --> 21:20.800
IMPORTS FROM THE PHILIPPINES --

21:20.866 --> 21:22.066
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY, OF COURSE,

JOLLIBEE.

THE WORLD'S GREATEST FAST FOOD

21:24.466 --> 21:25.600
MASCOT.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.066
BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, UNLIKE

21:27.133 --> 21:28.400
AMERICAN LABOR RECRUITERS IN

21:28.466 --> 21:30.166
THE '60s, JOLLIBEE CAN PROMISE

21:30.233 --> 21:31.900
YOU HAPPINESS, AND DELIVER IT TO

21:31.966 --> 21:34.633
YOU, IN VIDEOS LIKE THIS.

21:34.700 --> 21:46.033

21:46.100 --> 21:47.600

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I LOVE MORE,

21:51.733 --> 21:52.866
JOLLIBEE TASTEFULLY SHAKING THAT

21:52.933 --> 21:53.766

HIS SIGNATURE KETCHUP OR

NAUGHTY HUMANOID EYES.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.633
JOLLIBEE CAN GET IT!

22:00.700 --> 22:01.866
SO VERY BROADLY, ASIAN-AMERICANS

22:01.933 --> 22:03.533
BEFORE 1965 WERE LARGELY

22:03.600 --> 22:05.466
EXPLOITED FOR THEIR LABOR AND

22:05.533 --> 22:06.100
LEGALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,

22:06.166 --> 22:07.200
WHILE AFTER 1965, THERE WERE

22:07.266 --> 22:08.600
MANY MORE WHO CAME AS SKILLED

22:08.666 --> 22:09.766
WORKERS AND WHO FACED FEWER

22:09.833 --> 22:12.500
"FORMAL" LEGAL BARRIERS.

22:12.566 --> 22:13.566
AND THEN THERE'S A FINAL GROUP

22:13.633 --> 22:14.600
HERE, THAT HAD LESS TO DO WITH

22:14.666 --> 22:17.133
AMERICA'S LABOR NEEDS, AND MORE

22:17.200 --> 22:17.700
TO DO WITH ITS GEOPOLITICAL

22:17.766 --> 22:18.266
INTERESTS: THOSE WHO ARRIVED

22:18.333 --> 22:20.533
AS REFUGEES.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.200
BECAUSE BETWEEN 1975 AND 2010,

22:22.266 --> 22:24.033
WE TOOK IN OVER A MILLION

22:24.100 --> 22:25.166
REFUGEES FROM VIETNAM, LAOS,

22:25.233 --> 22:27.466
AND CAMBODIA.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.433
WHICH WASN'T SO MUCH "GENEROUS"

22:29.500 --> 22:30.533
AS IT WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF

22:30.600 --> 22:31.833
PEOPLE SEEKING REFUGE FROM WARS

22:31.900 --> 22:32.566
THAT AMERICA WAGED IN THE

22:32.633 --> 22:33.866
REGION.

22:33.933 --> 22:35.966
BASICALLY, WE BOMBED THE SHIT

22:36.033 --> 22:37.066
OUT OF THEIR COUNTRIES TO THWART

22:37.133 --> 22:38.300
THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM --

22:38.366 --> 22:39.800
SOMETIMES IN SECRET WARS TO

22:39.866 --> 22:41.600
FULFILL HENRY KISSINGER'S NAPALM

22:41.666 --> 22:42.800
KINK -- AND THEN, ONCE WE TOOK

22:42.866 --> 22:44.766
THOSE REFUGEES IN, WE DIDN'T

22:44.833 --> 22:46.100
REALLY DO MUCH TO SET THEM UP

22:46.166 --> 22:52.266
FOR SUCCESS.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.066
>> WHEN IT COMES TO REFUGEES, WE

22:55.133 --> 22:57.066
HOLD A LOT OF TRAUMA, PTSD,

22:57.133 --> 22:58.233
MENTAL ILLNESS FROM THE WAR AND

22:58.300 --> 23:02.133
THE GENOCIDE.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.133
>> WE HAVE IN THE U.S., WITH

23:03.200 --> 23:04.233
RESPECT TO OUR REFUGEE POLICY,

23:04.300 --> 23:05.200
THIS DOCTRINE OF WORK FIRST OR

23:05.266 --> 23:05.933
WORK IMMEDIATELY.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.966
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU JUST CAME

23:07.033 --> 23:07.866
FROM A WAR ZONE AND HAVEN'T

23:07.933 --> 23:08.533
HEALED FROM THE MENTAL AND

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
PHYSICAL TRAUMAS OF WAR,

23:09.666 --> 23:10.500
WE WANT YOU TO GET A LOW WAGE

23:10.566 --> 23:14.300
JOB IMMEDIATELY.

23:14.366 --> 23:15.233
>> John: AND THAT IS REALLY THE

23:15.300 --> 23:16.233
FULL SPECTRUM OF THE AMERICAN

23:16.300 --> 23:17.033
EXPERIENCE, ISN'T IT?

23:17.100 --> 23:17.800
TO GO FROM THE U.S. NOT GIVING

23:17.866 --> 23:18.733
A SHIT ABOUT YOUR LIFE ABROAD,

23:18.800 --> 23:19.833
TO NOT GIVING A SHIT ABOUT YOUR

23:19.900 --> 23:20.100
LIFE HERE.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.266
GOOD LUCK!

23:21.333 --> 23:22.800
BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK YOU

23:22.866 --> 23:24.033
HEAR BOMBS AGAIN, TRY NOT TO

23:24.100 --> 23:25.300
FREAK OUT -- IT'S EITHER A

23:25.366 --> 23:26.533
HOLIDAY HALF THE COUNTRY KIND OF

23:26.600 --> 23:27.166
HATES OR SOME COUPLE TELLING

23:27.233 --> 23:27.800
THEIR FRIENDS WHAT GENDER THEIR

23:27.866 --> 23:28.700
BABY IS.

23:28.766 --> 23:31.566
WELCOME TO AMERICA!

23:31.633 --> 23:34.200
THE POINT IS, DIFFERENT GROUPS

23:34.266 --> 23:35.000
OF ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE HAD

23:35.066 --> 23:36.233
VASTLY DIVERGENT MIGRATION

23:36.300 --> 23:37.433
EXPERIENCES.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.733
AND WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THEM

23:38.800 --> 23:40.600
MORE, THE VARIATION THAT YOU SEE

23:40.666 --> 23:41.633
-- IN EVERYTHING FROM INCOME TO

23:41.700 --> 23:43.166
EDUCATION TO HEALTH OUTCOMES --

23:43.233 --> 23:45.800
BEGINS TO MAKE SENSE.

23:45.866 --> 23:47.566
AND YET, GROUPS THAT HAVE, IN

23:47.633 --> 23:49.866
SOME WAYS, SO LITTLE IN COMMON,

23:49.933 --> 23:51.200
OFTEN HAVE BEEN UNIFIED,

23:51.266 --> 23:53.433
UNFORTUNATELY, THROUGH THE

23:53.500 --> 23:55.100
COMMON EXPERIENCE OF BIGOTRY, AS

23:55.166 --> 23:56.866
WAS THE CASE IN THE EARLY 1980s,

23:56.933 --> 23:57.700
WHEN AMERICA'S FEAR OF AN

23:57.766 --> 23:59.566
ECONOMICALLY ASCENDANT JAPAN LED

23:59.633 --> 24:01.800
TO A RACIST FERVOR AT HOME.

24:01.866 --> 24:03.633
>> PRETTY SOON, THE FINGER OF

24:03.700 --> 24:08.633
BLAME ENDED UP ON JAPAN.

24:08.700 --> 24:12.466
ALL OF THIS HATRED, YOU COULD

24:12.533 --> 24:14.566
FEEL IT, IT WAS PALPABLE.

24:14.633 --> 24:15.700
>> DETROITERS WERE INVITED FOR

24:15.766 --> 24:17.033
50 CENTS A SMASH TO TAKE OUT

24:17.100 --> 24:20.066
THEIR ANGER ON JAPANESE CARS.

24:20.133 --> 24:21.700
>> John: WOW, THAT'S STUPID.

24:21.766 --> 24:22.900
I HONESTLY CAN'T THINK OF A

24:22.966 --> 24:24.666
SINGLE GOOD REASON TO BEAT UP

24:24.733 --> 24:26.466
A CAR, EXCEPT MAYBE IF

24:26.533 --> 24:27.433
LIGHTNING McQUEEN OWES YOU

24:27.500 --> 24:28.700
MONEY.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.033
AND TO BE HONEST, IF YOU REALLY

24:30.100 --> 24:31.300
WANT TO HURT HIM, YOU DON'T BEAT

24:31.366 --> 24:32.966
HIM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER.

24:33.033 --> 24:33.900
YOU LIGHT MATER ON FIRE,

24:33.966 --> 24:34.900
AND YOU MAKE HIM WATCH.

24:34.966 --> 24:38.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

24:39.666 --> 24:40.566
WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY,

24:40.633 --> 24:41.833
McQUEEN?

24:41.900 --> 24:42.800
BUT TRAGICALLY, AND

24:42.866 --> 24:44.166
UNSURPRISINGLY, THAT TYPE OF

24:44.233 --> 24:45.466
RESENTMENT AND BLAME TURNED TO

24:45.533 --> 24:46.566
VIOLENCE, AND EVENTUALLY

24:46.633 --> 24:48.700
CULMINATED IN THE MURDER OF

24:48.766 --> 24:50.333
VINCENT CHIN, A CHINESE-AMERICAN

24:50.400 --> 24:51.966
MAN WHO WAS BEATEN TO DEATH BY

24:52.033 --> 24:52.900
TWO WHITE MEN WHO BLAMED HIM FOR

24:52.966 --> 24:53.700
WHAT JAPAN WAS DOING TO

24:53.766 --> 24:55.366
THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY.

24:55.433 --> 24:57.566
CHIN'S KILLERS WERE ARRESTED AND

24:57.633 --> 24:59.266
CONVICTED, BUT THE JUDGE

24:59.333 --> 25:01.433
SENTENCED THEM TO EXACTLY NO

25:01.500 --> 25:03.433
PRISON TIME, INSTEAD GIVING EACH

25:03.500 --> 25:05.066
OF THEM THREE YEARS' PROBATION

25:05.133 --> 25:06.600
AND LESS THAN $4,000 IN FINES.

25:06.666 --> 25:07.966
AND HE INSISTED AT THE TIME HE'D

25:08.033 --> 25:10.733
MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.166
>> JUDGE CHARLES KAUFMAN SAYS

25:12.233 --> 25:13.133
JUSTICE WAS DONE.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.100
HE WOULD NOT TALK TO CBS NEWS,

25:15.166 --> 25:16.766
BUT HE DID TELL A DETROIT

25:16.833 --> 25:17.733
NEWSPAPER THAT THE TWO

25:17.800 --> 25:19.866
DEFENDANTS WERE LONGTIME,

25:19.933 --> 25:20.833
HARDWORKING MEMBERS OF THE

25:20.900 --> 25:21.900
COMMUNITY, ADDING, "THESE MEN

25:21.966 --> 25:23.266
ARE NOT GOING TO GO OUT AND HARM

25:23.333 --> 25:24.466
SOMEBODY ELSE.

25:24.533 --> 25:25.333
I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT PUTTING

25:25.400 --> 25:26.666
THEM IN PRISON WOULD DO ANY GOOD

25:26.733 --> 25:28.100
FOR THEM OR FOR SOCIETY."

25:28.166 --> 25:30.133
>> John: OH, IT GETS WORSE!

25:30.200 --> 25:31.633
THAT JUDGE ALSO SAID, "THESE

25:31.700 --> 25:32.633
WEREN'T THE KIND OF MEN YOU SEND

25:32.700 --> 25:33.866
TO JAIL."

25:33.933 --> 25:35.500
AND IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT

25:35.566 --> 25:37.100
CRITERIA THAT JUDGE USED TO

25:37.166 --> 25:38.266
DECIDE WHAT KIND OF MEN THESE

25:38.333 --> 25:40.100
TWO MURDERERS WERE.

25:40.166 --> 25:40.866
WAS IT THE COLOR OF THE SKIN

25:40.933 --> 25:41.933
ON THEIR FACES?

25:42.000 --> 25:42.533
THE COLOR OF THE SKIN

25:42.600 --> 25:44.666
ON THEIR HANDS?

25:44.733 --> 25:46.300
OR JUST JUDICIAL INSTINCT -- A

25:46.366 --> 25:47.666
GUT FEELING THAT THESE TWO MEN

25:47.733 --> 25:48.966
WERE, IN FACT, WHITE?

25:49.033 --> 25:50.033
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THE

25:50.100 --> 25:50.966
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM:

25:51.033 --> 25:51.900
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S MORE

25:51.966 --> 25:54.800
RACE ART THAN RACE SCIENCE.

25:54.866 --> 25:56.500
BUT THE ENDURING LEGACY OF

25:56.566 --> 25:57.733
THE VINCENT CHIN CASE WAS THAT

25:57.800 --> 25:59.500
IT MANAGED TO BRING

25:59.566 --> 26:00.566
ASIAN-AMERICANS OF ALL

26:00.633 --> 26:01.566
ETHNICITIES TOGETHER

26:01.633 --> 26:03.533
TO CALL FOR JUSTICE.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.633
AND OUT OF THAT SPRANG

26:05.700 --> 26:06.400
A NEW CHAPTER OF ASIAN-AMERICAN

26:06.466 --> 26:10.000
ACTIVISM AND POLITICAL IDENTITY.

26:10.066 --> 26:10.933
AND THAT'S JUST THE MOST FAMOUS

26:11.000 --> 26:12.266
EXAMPLE OF A RICH HISTORY OF

26:12.333 --> 26:13.833
ASIAN-AMERICAN ACTIVISM.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.266
WHICH HAS OFTEN WORKED ACROSS

26:15.333 --> 26:17.100
RACIAL LINES, FROM THE STUDENT

26:17.166 --> 26:18.466
STRIKE WE MENTIONED EARLIER, TO

26:18.533 --> 26:20.333
FILIPINO LABOR LEADERS WORKING

26:20.400 --> 26:21.733
WITH CESAR CHAVEZ TO ORGANIZE

26:21.800 --> 26:23.433
A GRAPE BOYCOTT,

26:23.500 --> 26:24.300
TO YURI KOCHIYAMA'S FRIENDSHIP

26:24.366 --> 26:25.633
WITH MALCOLM X AND HER ADVOCACY

26:25.700 --> 26:26.700
FOR MARGINALIZED PEOPLE OF ALL

26:26.766 --> 26:28.633
BACKGROUNDS.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.966
AND YET A PREVAILING NARRATIVE

26:31.033 --> 26:32.800
MOST PEOPLE HEAR REGARDING

26:32.866 --> 26:36.100
ASIAN-AMERICANS IS ONE OF

26:36.166 --> 26:37.366
CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM AND OTHER

26:37.433 --> 26:38.900
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- LIKE

26:38.966 --> 26:41.366
DURING THE 1992 L.A. UPRISING.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.433
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT THOSE

26:43.500 --> 26:44.433
TENSIONS AREN'T VERY REAL.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.366
BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE.

26:46.433 --> 26:47.933
AND IT'S ALSO A NARRATIVE THAT

26:48.000 --> 26:49.300
FITS INTO A MUCH LARGER PATTERN,

26:49.366 --> 26:51.300
IN WHICH WHITE AMERICA HAS

26:51.366 --> 26:52.666
ACTIVELY PITTED ASIAN-AMERICANS

26:52.733 --> 26:54.900
AGAINST OTHER COMMUNITIES.

26:54.966 --> 26:57.366
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

26:57.433 --> 26:58.266
HALF OF THIS SENTENCE, AND THE

26:58.333 --> 27:01.100
"MODEL MINORITY" MYTH.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.066
THE IDEA OF THE MODEL MINORITY

27:03.133 --> 27:04.533
EMERGED OVER HALF A CENTURY AGO,

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
IN PART BECAUSE SOME

27:05.666 --> 27:07.366
ASIAN-AMERICANS WERE

27:07.433 --> 27:08.666
STRATEGICALLY TYPECASTING

27:08.733 --> 27:09.433
THEMSELVES IN A BID TO ENHANCE

27:09.500 --> 27:10.833
THEIR DEMANDS FOR

27:10.900 --> 27:11.733
RACIAL EQUALITY.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.366
AND THEY DID SO BY PROMOTING

27:13.433 --> 27:14.266
THEIR COMMUNITIES AS UPSTANDING

27:14.333 --> 27:16.600
AND HARDWORKING.

27:16.666 --> 27:18.700
AND AS IMMIGRATION LAW BEGAN

27:18.766 --> 27:19.933
SELECTING FOR SKILLED AND

27:20.000 --> 27:21.900
EDUCATED ASIAN IMMIGRANTS,

27:21.966 --> 27:23.600
THE CREDENTIALS OF THOSE NEW

27:23.666 --> 27:25.566
ARRIVALS SEEMED TO CONFORM TO

27:25.633 --> 27:28.833
THE STEREOTYPE, WHICH THEN TOOK

27:28.900 --> 27:29.933
ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN, ESPECIALLY

27:30.000 --> 27:32.900
IN THE CIVIL-RIGHTS ERA,

27:32.966 --> 27:34.266
AS WHITES, UNNERVED BY BLACK

27:34.333 --> 27:35.633
AMERICANS' RADICAL CHALLENGES TO

27:35.700 --> 27:36.566
THE SYSTEM, HELD UP JAPANESE AND

27:36.633 --> 27:39.100
CHINESE-AMERICANS AND THEIR

27:39.166 --> 27:40.200
SUCCESS AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY

27:40.266 --> 27:41.266
CLAIMED DISPROVED SYSTEMIC

27:41.333 --> 27:44.466
RACISM.

27:44.533 --> 27:46.100
VERY BASICALLY, AMERICA

27:46.166 --> 27:51.733
PRIORITIZED WEALTHY, MORE

27:51.800 --> 27:52.533
EDUCATED ASIAN IMMIGRANTS,

27:52.600 --> 27:53.233
THEN TURNED TO BLACK PEOPLE --

27:53.300 --> 27:53.900
WHO'D BEEN SUBJUGATED

27:53.966 --> 27:55.033
FOR CENTURIES -- AND SAID, "SEE?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.233
THEY'RE EDUCATED AND SUCCESSFUL,

27:56.300 --> 27:57.233
WHY AREN'T YOU?"

27:57.300 --> 27:58.266
AND USING ASIAN-AMERICAN SUCCESS

27:58.333 --> 27:59.400
TO DOWNPLAY AMERICAN RACISM IS

27:59.466 --> 28:00.400
A TREND THAT VERY MUCH CONTINUES

28:00.466 --> 28:02.700
TO THIS DAY.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.133
>> IF AMERICA WAS SUCH A

28:04.200 --> 28:05.733
HATE-FILLED, DISCRIMINATORY,

28:05.800 --> 28:14.600
RACIST SOCIETY FILLED WITH

28:14.666 --> 28:15.566
ANIMUS AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICANS,

28:15.633 --> 28:16.300
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE

28:16.366 --> 28:17.466
REMARKABLE SUCCESS OF

28:17.533 --> 28:19.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS IN OUR COUNTRY?

28:19.066 --> 28:20.200
>> THEIR MINDSET IS TO JUST WORK

28:20.266 --> 28:20.833
REALLY HARD.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.866
IT'S NOT TO PROTEST THINGS AND

28:21.933 --> 28:22.633
NOT TO SHUT THINGS DOWN.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.966
IT'S JUST TO WORK REALLY HARD.

28:25.033 --> 28:26.400
ASIANS, THE WHOLE REASON

28:26.466 --> 28:27.100
WHY THEY KICK ASS IS BECAUSE

28:27.166 --> 28:28.033
THEY DON'T SPEND ANY TIME ON

28:28.100 --> 28:29.166
PETTY BULLSHIT.

28:29.233 --> 28:29.933
>> ASIANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

28:30.000 --> 28:31.200
HATE CRIMES, BUT THEY'RE

28:31.266 --> 28:32.000
VERY UPWARDLY MOBILE,

28:32.066 --> 28:32.866
VERY SUCCESS-ORIENTED,

28:32.933 --> 28:34.166
VERY BUSINESS-ORIENTED.

28:34.233 --> 28:37.333
THEY'RE MODEL CITIZENS

28:37.400 --> 28:38.466
IN MANY CASES IN MY VIEW.

28:38.533 --> 28:39.733
PROBABLY THE MOST ADMIRABLE

28:39.800 --> 28:41.000
ETHNIC GROUP WE HAVE.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.166
>> John: WOW, CONGRATULATIONS,

28:42.233 --> 28:44.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS!

28:44.066 --> 28:45.000
DICK MORRIS THINKS YOU'RE THE

28:45.066 --> 28:46.266
MOST ADMIRABLE ETHNIC GROUP WE

28:46.333 --> 28:47.233
HAVE.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.800
THAT'S SO SWEET OF HIM TO SAY.

28:48.866 --> 28:50.533
IF YOU WANT TO WRITE DICK A

28:50.600 --> 28:52.100
THANK YOU NOTE, JUST ADDRESS THE

28:52.166 --> 28:54.433
ENVELOPE TO "SHOVE THIS RIGHT UP

28:54.500 --> 28:56.266
DICK MORRIS'S ASS, NEW YORK, NY,

28:56.333 --> 28:57.200
WHATEVER ZIP CODE DICK MORRIS'S

28:57.266 --> 28:58.700
ASSHOLE IS IN."

28:58.766 --> 29:00.566
A CENTRAL PREMISE OF

29:00.633 --> 29:01.633
THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH IS THAT

29:01.700 --> 29:03.266
THE KEY TO OVERCOMING AMERICAN

29:03.333 --> 29:05.666
RACISM IS SIMPLY STRONG VALUES

29:05.733 --> 29:09.233
AND HARD WORK -- WITH THE

29:09.300 --> 29:10.600
IMPLICATION BEING THAT GROUPS

29:10.666 --> 29:12.300
THAT HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED SIMPLY

29:12.366 --> 29:13.000
HAVEN'T TRIED HARD ENOUGH.

29:13.066 --> 29:13.733
AND PUTTING ASIDE HOW OFFENSIVE

29:13.800 --> 29:15.866
THAT IS, THE TRUTH IS, WHETHER

29:15.933 --> 29:16.966
OR NOT YOU'RE "SUCCESSFUL,"

29:17.033 --> 29:19.133
LIVING A LIFE DEFINED BY A

29:19.200 --> 29:20.333
RACIST FANTASY JUST ISN'T

29:20.400 --> 29:21.666
GOOD FOR YOU.

29:21.733 --> 29:23.233
>> STRIVING TO MAINTAIN THE IDEA

29:23.300 --> 29:24.866
OF A "MODEL MINORITY" HAS REALLY

29:24.933 --> 29:28.900
SEVERED MY SELF-ESTEEM.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.300
IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL THAT I'M

29:30.366 --> 29:32.800
NOTHING MORE THAN SOMEONE WHO

29:32.866 --> 29:33.900
COULD GET GOOD GRADES, SOMEONE

29:33.966 --> 29:35.500
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT,

29:35.566 --> 29:37.200
AND BE MUM ABOUT EVERYTHING.

29:37.266 --> 29:38.133
>> John: RIGHT.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.166
TRYING TO BE PERFECT YOUR WHOLE

29:40.233 --> 29:41.533
LIFE IS GOING TO BE TOO MUCH TO

29:41.600 --> 29:43.933
BEAR.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
THAT'S WHY I MADE A PROMISE WHEN

29:45.066 --> 29:45.566
I STARTED THIS SHOW THAT I'D

29:45.633 --> 29:46.500
ALWAYS GET ONE FACT IN EVERY

29:46.566 --> 29:48.033
STORY COMPLETELY WRONG.

29:48.100 --> 29:48.633
IS THAT RESPONSIBLE?

29:48.700 --> 29:50.166
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

29:50.233 --> 29:51.100
BUT IT IS WHAT KEEPS ME LOOKING

29:51.166 --> 29:53.500
YOUNG.

29:53.566 --> 29:54.933
AND THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH IS

29:55.000 --> 29:56.833
ESPECIALLY GALLING FOR SOME

29:56.900 --> 29:57.900
MEMBERS OF GROUPS -- LIKE THOSE

29:57.966 --> 29:59.366
WHOSE FAMILIES CAME AS REFUGEES

29:59.433 --> 30:00.766
-- WHOSE LIVED EXPERIENCE

30:00.833 --> 30:01.900
DOESN'T REMOTELY MATCH THE

30:02.000 --> 30:03.366
STEREOTYPE.

30:03.433 --> 30:05.566
THE TRUTH IS, THAT KIND OF

30:05.633 --> 30:08.266
PRESSURE CAN DO REAL DAMAGE.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.966
SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF

30:10.033 --> 30:11.733
DEATH FOR ASIAN-AMERICANS

30:11.800 --> 30:13.366
BETWEEN THE AGES OF 15 AND 24.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.433
AND YET, APPARENTLY, ONLY 8% OF

30:15.500 --> 30:18.400
ASIAN-AMERICANS SOUGHT HELP FOR

30:18.466 --> 30:20.000
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH, WHICH IS

30:20.066 --> 30:21.366
LESS THAN HALF THE RATE OF THE

30:21.433 --> 30:24.866
GENERAL POPULATION.

30:24.933 --> 30:25.833
AND THAT IS NOT JUST A RESULT OF

30:25.900 --> 30:26.900
CULTURAL STIGMAS AROUND

30:26.966 --> 30:27.400
MENTAL HEALTH.

30:27.466 --> 30:28.666
IT'S ALSO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

30:28.733 --> 30:30.433
YOU'RE CONSISTENTLY TOLD TO

30:30.500 --> 30:31.900
QUIETLY AND HAPPILY ACCEPT

30:31.966 --> 30:33.200
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE YOUR

30:33.266 --> 30:37.366
VERSION IS THE "NICE RACISM."

30:37.433 --> 30:38.833
BUT THERE IS NO NICE RACISM.

30:38.900 --> 30:42.033
THERE IS NO SILVER LINING TO IT,

30:42.100 --> 30:42.666
AND THERE IS NO WORKING YOUR WAY

30:42.733 --> 30:43.700
OUT OF IT.

30:43.766 --> 30:45.300
YOU'RE STILL PERPETUALLY TREATED

30:45.366 --> 30:46.066
AS A FOREIGNER, STILL ASKED

30:46.133 --> 30:47.566
WHERE YOU'RE "REALLY FROM," AND

30:47.633 --> 30:49.600
ASIAN-AMERICANS ALWAYS SEEM TO

30:49.666 --> 30:51.100
BE ONE GEOPOLITICAL CRISIS AWAY

30:51.166 --> 30:53.733
FROM BECOMING THE TARGETS OF

30:53.800 --> 30:55.433
VIOLENCE YET AGAIN, WHETHER IT'S

30:55.500 --> 30:57.266
THOSE INTERNMENT CAMPS FOR

30:57.333 --> 30:58.433
JAPANESE-AMERICANS, OR THE SPATE

30:58.500 --> 31:01.366
OF ATTACKS ON SOUTH ASIANS AFTER

31:01.433 --> 31:02.166
9/11, OR ALL THE RECENT RACIAL

31:02.233 --> 31:04.766
VIOLENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC.

31:04.833 --> 31:05.866
SO THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH IS

31:05.933 --> 31:07.400
BOTH A TOOL OF WHITE SUPREMACY

31:07.466 --> 31:09.133
AND A TRAP.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.400
AND AS WITH SO MANY THINGS IN

31:10.466 --> 31:12.966
THIS STORY, WITH A COMMUNITY

31:13.033 --> 31:14.666
THIS DIVERSE, THERE ARE GOING TO

31:14.733 --> 31:15.466
BE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON HOW

31:15.533 --> 31:16.633
TO HANDLE IT.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.666
ANDREW YANG HAS ANNOYED SOME

31:17.733 --> 31:19.300
BY LEANING INTO IT, WITH

31:19.366 --> 31:20.400
SELF-DEPRECATING JOKES AND HIS

31:20.466 --> 31:22.066
FUCKING MATH HAT.

31:22.133 --> 31:23.400
AND HE ALSO ANGERED MANY WHEN

31:23.466 --> 31:24.633
HE RESPONDED TO THE TRUMP

31:24.700 --> 31:25.566
ADMINISTRATION'S "CHINA VIRUS"

31:25.633 --> 31:28.266
RHETORIC BY WRITING AN OP-ED IN

31:28.333 --> 31:29.600
WHICH HE CLAIMED, "WE ASIAN

31:29.666 --> 31:31.133
AMERICANS NEED TO EMBRACE AND

31:31.200 --> 31:33.266
SHOW OUR AMERICAN-NESS IN WAYS

31:33.333 --> 31:34.900
WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE" BY, AMONG

31:34.966 --> 31:35.966
OTHER THINGS, "WEARING RED,

31:36.033 --> 31:37.066
WHITE, AND BLUE."

31:37.133 --> 31:39.333
THAT ARGUMENT PROMPTED A

31:39.400 --> 31:41.433
BACKLASH, WITH EDDIE HUANG

31:41.500 --> 31:44.000
TWEETING, "FUCK OUT OF HERE WITH

31:44.066 --> 31:46.133
THIS AMERICA DRAG...YOU BUMBLING

31:46.200 --> 31:46.933
PINEAPPLE BUN," AND I DO GET

31:47.000 --> 31:48.166
THAT.

31:48.233 --> 31:49.266
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY INSULTING

31:49.333 --> 31:50.566
TO SUGGEST TWO CENTURIES OF

31:50.633 --> 31:51.800
RACISM COULD BE DEFEATED BY

31:51.866 --> 31:55.533
SERVING UNCLE SAM REALNESS.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.266
SO ALL OF THAT IS, VERY

31:57.333 --> 31:59.033
SIMPLISTICALLY, TOO BROADLY

31:59.100 --> 32:00.200
AND PROBABLY TOO QUICKLY, AN

32:00.266 --> 32:01.500
ABRIDGED VERSION OF HOW WE ALL

32:01.566 --> 32:03.700
GOT TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

32:03.766 --> 32:08.833
SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

32:08.900 --> 32:09.866
WELL, WHAT IS CLEAR IS, WE HAVE

32:09.933 --> 32:10.900
TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE SMARTER,

32:10.966 --> 32:12.166
MORE NUANCED CONVERSATIONS

32:12.233 --> 32:13.300
ABOUT THE REALITY OF

32:13.366 --> 32:16.400
THE ASIAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

32:16.466 --> 32:17.166
AND WE CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT

32:17.233 --> 32:18.200
ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY,

32:18.266 --> 32:21.300
DISAGGREGATED DATA THAT CAN HELP

32:21.366 --> 32:23.166
BETTER FIT PUBLIC POLICY TO THE

32:23.233 --> 32:23.933
ACTUAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL

32:24.000 --> 32:25.733
COMMUNITIES.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.233
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL.

32:27.300 --> 32:28.133
BECAUSE ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE

32:28.200 --> 32:29.333
BEEN WARNING FOR DECADES ABOUT

32:29.400 --> 32:29.766
ALL OF THIS.

32:29.833 --> 32:30.900
JUST WATCH A MAN TELL A

32:30.966 --> 32:33.266
REPORTER, FIVE YEARS BEFORE I

32:33.333 --> 32:40.666
WAS EVEN BORN, WHAT I'VE BEEN

32:40.733 --> 32:42.400
TRYING TO TELL YOU, DURING YET

32:42.466 --> 32:44.600
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE OLD "MODEL

32:44.666 --> 32:45.033
MINORITY" PROFILES.

32:45.100 --> 32:45.666
>> BUT I SUGGESTED THAT COMPARED

32:45.733 --> 32:47.166
TO THE BLACK AND CHICANO, THE

32:47.233 --> 32:48.033
JAPANESE-AMERICAN HAS IT MADE.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.266
HE CAN GET A JOB, A PLACE TO

32:49.333 --> 32:50.333
LIVE.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.733
>> IT'S A SITUATION WHERE I

32:51.800 --> 32:53.133
THINK THE QUESTION IS NOT

32:53.200 --> 32:54.200
MATERIAL, MAKING IT IN TERMS OF

32:54.266 --> 32:55.400
ECONOMICS, BUT A QUESTION

32:55.466 --> 32:56.266
BASICALLY OF HUMAN DIGNITY.

32:56.333 --> 32:57.200
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IN TERMS OF

32:57.266 --> 32:58.133
HUMAN DIGNITY?

32:58.200 --> 32:58.900
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE BEEN

32:58.966 --> 32:59.600
SET IN A CERTAIN CATEGORY AND

32:59.666 --> 33:00.600
MANY PEOPLE ARGUE,

33:00.666 --> 33:01.733
"MAN, YOU GOT A GOOD STEREOTYPE!

33:01.800 --> 33:02.900
YOU GOT A STEREOTYPE THAT GETS

33:02.966 --> 33:05.200
YOU APARTMENTS WHERE YOU DON'T

33:05.266 --> 33:06.400
HAVE TO PAY A CLEANING DEPOSIT

33:06.466 --> 33:07.500
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GODDAMN

33:07.566 --> 33:08.166
CLEAN!"

33:08.233 --> 33:09.133
THAT'S OUR STEREOTYPE, BUT IT'S

33:09.200 --> 33:10.233
AN INFRINGEMENT, IT'S A

33:10.300 --> 33:11.633
VIOLATION OF OUR HUMAN DIGNITY,

33:11.700 --> 33:13.066
'CAUSE THEY DON'T VIEW US AS

33:13.133 --> 33:14.300
INDIVIDUALS, AS HUMAN BEINGS.

33:14.366 --> 33:15.566
WE FIT INTO A CERTAIN CATEGORY,

33:15.633 --> 33:17.600
WE FIT INTO A CERTAIN BOX.

33:17.666 --> 33:18.100
THAT'S HOW THEY VIEW US.

33:18.166 --> 33:19.200
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

33:19.266 --> 33:21.200
IT'S A CATEGORY, IT'S A BOX,

33:21.266 --> 33:22.266
BUT THE THING IS, YOU DON'T

33:22.333 --> 33:23.600
LEARN ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS

33:23.666 --> 33:25.133
YOU BOTHER TO LOOK INSIDE.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.966
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, NO GROUP,

33:28.033 --> 33:30.000
COMMUNITY, OR INDEED,

33:30.066 --> 33:30.633
INDIVIDUAL, IS JUST ONE THING.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.166
AND WHEN YOU REDUCE

33:32.233 --> 33:33.600
THE ASIAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE TO

33:33.666 --> 33:34.766
THAT OF A "MODEL MINORITY,"

33:34.833 --> 33:35.733
YOU'RE OMITTING A HISTORY THAT

33:35.800 --> 33:37.666
INCLUDES EXPLOITATION AND

33:37.733 --> 33:38.933
EXCLUSION, BUT ALSO INCLUDES

33:39.000 --> 33:40.533
ACTIVISM, SOME INFIGHTING,

33:40.600 --> 33:41.400
CHALLENGES WITH ISSUES LIKE

33:41.466 --> 33:42.733
IMMIGRATION, EDUCATION, AND

33:42.800 --> 33:43.900
ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES THAT

33:43.966 --> 33:45.333
CONTINUE TO THIS DAY,

33:45.400 --> 33:46.800
AND AN ARRAY OF INTERESTS AND

33:46.866 --> 33:48.966
ACHIEVEMENTS THAT GO FAR BEYOND

33:49.033 --> 33:50.466
THESE TWO GUYS, TO BE AS VAST

33:50.533 --> 34:00.366
AND DIVERSE AS AMERICA ITSELF.

34:00.433 --> 34:01.500
AND BY THE WAY, CAN YOU SEE WHO

34:01.566 --> 34:02.366
IS IN THERE?

34:02.433 --> 34:03.166
I TOLD YOU, KAREEM!

34:03.233 --> 34:04.466
I TOLD YOU I GOT YOUR BACK!

34:04.533 --> 34:05.533
I SEE YOU, KAREEM!

34:05.600 --> 34:06.433
AND I KNOW THIS STORY HAS BARELY

34:06.500 --> 34:07.700
SKIMMED THE SURFACE OF THIS

34:07.766 --> 34:08.466
SUBJECT, BUT I HOPE IT'S AT

34:08.533 --> 34:09.166
LEAST INTRODUCED SOME OF YOU TO

34:09.233 --> 34:10.266
A BIT OF THE HISTORY INVOLVED

34:10.333 --> 34:11.300
HERE, AS WELL AS WHAT I THINK

34:11.366 --> 34:12.533
WE CAN ALL AGREE IS THE WORLD'S

34:12.600 --> 34:13.833
MOST FUCKABLE BEE.

34:13.900 --> 34:14.633
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

34:14.700 --> 34:18.466
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:18.533 --> 34:20.400
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,

34:20.466 --> 34:21.466
GOOD NIGHT!
