14:46.022 --> 14:50.758
But when I do fight back,
you'll know it.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.827
Something funny, Mark?

14:52.829 --> 14:55.329
You're both damaged goods.

14:55.331 --> 14:59.551
Having the two of you take each
other out wasn't just efficient.

14:59.553 --> 15:01.269
It was poetic.

15:01.271 --> 15:02.937
So why the cruise missile?

15:02.939 --> 15:06.808
Had to be sure.

15:06.810 --> 15:09.194
And how's that
working out for you?

15:12.982 --> 15:15.783
See you next time, huh?

15:15.785 --> 15:17.202
That's your cue.

15:17.204 --> 15:19.270
The men at the counter.

15:19.272 --> 15:21.262
Follow them outside.

15:26.361 --> 15:28.546
You're going to steal
their car.

15:28.548 --> 15:31.032
Pretty sure
they'll object to that.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.550
So change their minds.

15:32.552 --> 15:34.502
Or should I deal with them
my way?

15:34.504 --> 15:35.803
Hey, fellas?

15:35.805 --> 15:39.757
You got the time?

15:39.759 --> 15:42.644
[Gasping]

15:42.646 --> 15:44.345
That's enough.

15:44.347 --> 15:47.265
I said enough.

15:47.267 --> 15:49.434
I'll play along
with Kara's little game.

15:49.436 --> 15:51.552
But killing civilians isn't
going to be a part of it.

15:51.554 --> 15:52.654
Clear?

15:52.656 --> 15:53.888
Fine, John.

15:53.890 --> 15:56.190
What do you suggest?

15:56.192 --> 16:00.061
This guy's carrying.

16:00.063 --> 16:01.713
They're ATF agents.

16:01.715 --> 16:03.197
And now you are too.

16:10.239 --> 16:13.341
Answer the phone, John.

16:13.343 --> 16:15.409
But be smart
or I'll make it impossible

16:15.411 --> 16:18.463
for anyone to tell
where you end and Mark begins.

16:18.465 --> 16:19.631
Yep?

16:19.633 --> 16:21.248
Baker, we've got a situation

16:21.250 --> 16:22.517
developing over at 780 Mercer.

16:22.519 --> 16:24.418
Need you and Louis
to check it out.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.137
Will do.

16:26.139 --> 16:27.388
Time for you boys
to go to work.

16:52.666 --> 16:55.817
[Phone rings] Yes, Detective?

16:55.819 --> 16:59.120
So the hard drive
Snow stole from Fujima

16:59.122 --> 17:01.489
is from a small batch.

17:01.491 --> 17:04.125
Uh, model number DH-950.

17:04.127 --> 17:07.228
It's NSA certified.

17:07.230 --> 17:08.713
This model is made exclusively

17:08.714 --> 17:11.132
for government
and military installations.

17:11.134 --> 17:12.767
What would Stanton
want with it?

17:12.769 --> 17:15.603
If I had to guess,
it's to store something

17:15.605 --> 17:19.773
highly sensitive or dangerous.
[Phone vibrates]

Listen, I've just received a
text from an unfamiliar number.

17:23.446 --> 17:25.680
It reads UXO.

17:25.682 --> 17:27.781
UXO is the military designation

17:27.784 --> 17:29.350
for unexploded ordinance.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.454
Mr. Reese.

Now use your cover
to get inside the building.

We don't answer
to the Bomb Squad.

18:15.749 --> 18:17.198
What can I tell you?
It's SOP.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.283
You know what just a half
pound of semtex

18:18.285 --> 18:19.868
can do to a building like this

- No, but I got--
- Well, I do.

18:35.635 --> 18:38.252
No, but they were here.

18:38.254 --> 18:39.687
They followed
two other men out.

18:39.689 --> 18:41.723
It turns out the phone
that sent the text

18:41.725 --> 18:42.891
belongs to an ATF agent.

18:42.893 --> 18:44.109
He and his partner
were just called

18:44.111 --> 18:45.860
to a bomb threat at 780 Mercer.

18:45.862 --> 18:48.429
A bomb threat?

18:48.431 --> 18:50.315
It's an office building,
Detective.

18:50.317 --> 18:52.934
Mostly commercial
and corporate tenants.

18:52.936 --> 18:55.403
Oh, no, this is interesting.

18:55.405 --> 18:57.038
What is?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.123
The building has 21 floors,

18:58.125 --> 19:00.175
but the directory only lists 20.

19:00.177 --> 19:04.362
21st floor is registered
to a Stillwater Imports.

19:04.364 --> 19:07.065
Except Stillwater Imports
doesn't appear to have

19:07.067 --> 19:09.584
any ongoing business activity.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.252
This is a shell corporation.

19:11.254 --> 19:12.453
I'll keep looking into it,

19:12.455 --> 19:13.588
but whatever Stanton's after,

19:13.590 --> 19:16.441
I bet it's in there.

19:16.443 --> 19:18.560
You're going to the 21st floor.

as routine as a bomb threat.

very happy to see you boys.

sure deserves to die is you.

some signal interference

26:25.388 --> 26:28.422
Not bio.
Electronic.

26:28.424 --> 26:30.641
That room's a scif.

26:30.643 --> 26:32.977
Built to keep
any wireless or radio signals

26:32.979 --> 26:34.312
from getting in or out.

26:34.314 --> 26:35.963

26:35.965 --> 26:37.431
You need to get into that room.

26:37.433 --> 26:38.516
Mark can take it from there.

26:38.518 --> 26:40.017
What's in there, Kara?

26:40.019 --> 26:42.436
Just get inside
and don't drag your feet.

26:42.438 --> 26:44.272
Or you'll detonate?

26:44.274 --> 26:46.824
You do and you'll blow up
your plan along with us.

Fond as I am of you, John,

26:48.745 --> 26:52.330

how expendable you are.

26:52.332 --> 26:57.368
See you tomorrow, Jimmy.

26:57.370 --> 27:00.838
We're gonna need you
to put in some overtime.

Do you guys have
any idea where you are?

Just give us a hand, would you?

27:16.338 --> 27:19.173

27:19.175 --> 27:21.559

27:27.115 --> 27:30.034
Mark, we don't have to do this.

27:30.036 --> 27:32.686
Yes, we do or we're dead.

27:32.688 --> 27:34.372
No, there's no signal.

27:34.374 --> 27:35.790
She can't hear us.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.025
We can figure out
a way to stop her

27:38.027 --> 27:39.160
or at least a way out
of these vests.

27:39.162 --> 27:41.329
I've tried.

27:41.331 --> 27:43.164
- There isn't one.
- Well, there has to be.

27:43.166 --> 27:46.884
We don't have time.

27:46.886 --> 27:49.370
- Show him the servers.
- This way.

27:49.372 --> 27:53.591
I'll let you know when
I find a bay for the drive.

27:59.264 --> 28:02.433
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

28:02.435 --> 28:05.069
I'm gonna try to get us
out of this alive, Kevin.

28:05.071 --> 28:07.772
But I'm gonna need your help.

Hello?

28:09.492 --> 28:12.076
- It's me.
- Mr. Reese.

28:12.078 --> 28:14.578
I don't have much time.
I'm in a DOD facility.

28:14.580 --> 28:17.281
I got your text.
What is she having you do?

28:17.283 --> 28:19.333
Stealing something, I think.

28:19.335 --> 28:21.585
I think she may be aiming
to steal a cyber weapon.

28:21.587 --> 28:25.539
Cyber weapon?

28:25.541 --> 28:28.709

- Uh...

aren't networked.

Yes, nothing in here can be
allowed to get out there.

She may be looking
for a project

28:52.652 --> 28:54.902
with a code name "Cygnus."

28:54.904 --> 28:56.303
What is Cygnus?

28:56.305 --> 28:58.539
It's a new super virus.

28:58.541 --> 29:00.991
In the wrong hands it could
cripple major civilian networks,

29:00.993 --> 29:04.328
our own defense systems,
even kill the entire internet.

29:04.330 --> 29:07.048
Which means it could be used
to shut down the machine.

29:07.050 --> 29:08.282
I won't let that happen.

Mr. Reese?

29:17.009 --> 29:18.726
Is there a way
to erase these drives?

29:18.728 --> 29:22.730
Only if there's a security
breach to the system.

is to wipe the drives.

anything from this place.

it will charge the capacitor

40:31.377 --> 40:33.744
[Car alarms ring]

40:33.746 --> 40:38.933
[Overlapping chatter]

40:47.859 --> 40:51.762
Guess Snow retired after all.

41:09.881 --> 41:12.132
[Bear barks]

41:12.134 --> 41:14.502
Hey, boy.

41:18.089 --> 41:20.007
[Laughs]

41:20.009 --> 41:22.810
Hey, hey.
[Grunts]

41:22.812 --> 41:24.962
Detective?

41:24.964 --> 41:27.648
Agent Moss.

41:27.650 --> 41:28.966
What brings you by?

41:28.968 --> 41:30.351
We identified
the suicide bombers

41:30.353 --> 41:32.186
who broke into
the DOD facility.

41:32.188 --> 41:34.605
Apparently they were a couple
of rogue CIA agents.

41:34.607 --> 41:39.827
Agency's not saying a peep,
but we think they went pro.

41:39.829 --> 41:41.812
This one, Mark Snow,
fits the description

41:41.814 --> 41:44.181
of your "man in a suit."

41:44.183 --> 41:46.617
Really?

41:46.619 --> 41:48.652
We believe Donnelly
was on to them.

41:48.654 --> 41:50.037
They found out and killed him.

41:50.039 --> 41:51.956
So does that mean
the Bureau's case

41:51.958 --> 41:53.824
against the man
in the suit is--

41:53.826 --> 41:55.709
Closed officially.

41:55.711 --> 41:59.713
As for Donnelly, we'll deal
with the agency on our end.

41:59.715 --> 42:04.184
- You take care, Detective.
- Thank you.

42:09.274 --> 42:11.008
Hey.
Everything okay?

42:11.010 --> 42:14.194
We'll see.

42:22.487 --> 42:24.488
The hard drive
tell you anything?

42:24.490 --> 42:27.074
Nothing yet.

42:27.076 --> 42:30.294
Whatever she uploaded,
the encryption is remarkable.

42:30.296 --> 42:31.762
I can only assume
that the malware

42:31.764 --> 42:33.964
it's protecting
is equally sophisticated.

42:33.966 --> 42:35.666
The only thing I've been able
to decompile

42:35.668 --> 42:37.217
is when it's set to go live

42:37.219 --> 42:39.336
a little more
than five months from now.

42:39.338 --> 42:40.704
What happens then?

42:40.706 --> 42:43.040
I suppose we'll find out.

42:45.727 --> 42:47.845
Finch?

42:47.847 --> 42:51.715
Thank you.

42:51.717 --> 42:56.003
Please, don't mention it.

43:04.863 --> 43:08.899
Well, I'm afraid a name
is all I have for you...

43:08.901 --> 43:14.538
for someone who seemingly does
not exist on any known database.

43:14.540 --> 43:18.759
Perhaps you'll have better luck
your search than I did.
