00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪

00:07.088 --> 00:09.300
(modulated voice) This week
 on The Princess Unboxer,

00:09.300 --> 00:12.343
we're unboxing
 the Princess Space
 Adventure Set.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.267
They just open boxes of toys?

00:17.518 --> 00:20.271
And this channel
has a million subscribers?

00:20.271 --> 00:22.773
Why are we working so hard?

00:22.773 --> 00:24.905
How tough is it
to open stuff?

00:24.905 --> 00:26.277
I can do that!

00:31.652 --> 00:33.864
I'm not hungry.

00:33.864 --> 00:36.537
No one knows
who The Princess Unboxer is.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.999
It's a total mystery.

00:38.999 --> 00:41.502
Like white jeans.

00:41.502 --> 00:44.625
Aw, man, you're watching
that weird unboxing thing?

00:44.625 --> 00:47.128
-I don't get it.
-All: Yeah, it's weird.

00:47.128 --> 00:48.629
-Let's watch something else.
-All: No!

00:48.629 --> 00:49.840
Fine!

00:49.840 --> 00:51.342
I got dares to do,

00:51.342 --> 00:53.134
hot chocolate bars
to jump over.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.175
Here we go!

00:59.390 --> 01:00.601
What'd you guys think?

01:00.601 --> 01:03.484
All:
Great. Awesome.
Nice. Best dare ever.

01:03.484 --> 01:06.737
Okay, two more minutes
of this, then I'm done.

01:08.859 --> 01:11.612
Okay, two more minutes
of this, then I'm done.

01:13.194 --> 01:15.246
(clicks)

01:15.246 --> 01:17.538
Hey, who's filming
in the Dare Lair?

01:17.538 --> 01:19.620
Dirk left hours ago.

01:21.702 --> 01:24.004
(Southern accent)
I reckon this kingdom
ain't big enough

01:24.004 --> 01:26.587
for two cowgirl princesses.

01:28.008 --> 01:29.710
(normal voice)
Uh...

01:29.710 --> 01:32.092
All:
Uh...

01:32.092 --> 01:33.594
This isn't what it looks like.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.596
You're the mystery unboxer!

01:35.596 --> 01:38.719
Oh, then it's exactly
what it looks like.

01:38.719 --> 01:40.891
I make these videos
for my little sisters.

01:40.891 --> 01:43.814
Plus, it's helped me rediscover
my childlike wonder.

01:43.814 --> 01:46.147
Aww. That's beautiful, man.

01:47.228 --> 01:49.900
Dirk plays with dolls.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.532
Can we go home now?

01:51.532 --> 01:53.694
We all need our beauty sleep.

01:53.694 --> 01:55.326
Some more than others.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.741
You've got five seconds
to look at someone else.

02:00.741 --> 02:02.293
Hold it!

02:02.293 --> 02:03.794
You know a secret about me,

02:03.794 --> 02:06.006
so now I need to know
a secret about you.

02:06.006 --> 02:07.708
It's the DareMeBro
Law of Secrets.

02:07.708 --> 02:10.591
For every secret,
there's an equal
and opposite re-secret.

02:10.591 --> 02:13.254
For a guy who has a season pass
to the emergency room,

02:13.254 --> 02:15.216
that's actually
pretty good logic.

02:16.217 --> 02:18.259
I'll go first.
I once buried--

02:18.259 --> 02:19.430
No!

02:19.430 --> 02:20.811
Not here.

02:20.811 --> 02:23.644
We must share our secrets
in a sacred space.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.436
(dramatic music playing)

02:25.436 --> 02:28.108
Ladies and Bernie...

02:29.610 --> 02:32.613
welcome to the DareMeBro
Circle of Truth.

02:32.613 --> 02:35.075
(upbeat music plays)

02:35.075 --> 02:36.537
Uh...

02:36.537 --> 02:37.658
Must be on shuffle!

02:39.540 --> 02:41.582
Well, since it's playing,
dance party?

02:41.582 --> 02:42.953

I missed it.

03:40.681 --> 03:42.052
Here's how this works.

03:42.052 --> 03:44.645
You will take a sip
of the mystical smoothie

03:44.645 --> 03:46.186
with protein boost,

03:46.186 --> 03:47.728
admit your secret,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.650
then pass the goblet
to the next person.

03:49.650 --> 03:52.152
We all drink
from the same cup?

03:52.152 --> 03:56.066
I really don't want to catch
what Bernie probably has.

03:56.066 --> 04:00.321
Had. I got the full round
of shots.

04:00.321 --> 04:03.624
Fair warning, I am
a human lie detector.

04:03.624 --> 04:05.326
If I sense anyone
being untruthful,

04:05.326 --> 04:06.707
I will call you on it.

04:06.707 --> 04:07.918
Okay.

04:07.918 --> 04:11.502
My secret will rattle you all
to the very core.

04:12.713 --> 04:15.676
I'm not incredibly
popular at school.

04:15.676 --> 04:16.716
All:
Yeah, we know.

04:17.878 --> 04:20.641
Um, I also cannot
dunk a basketball.

04:20.641 --> 04:23.013
-Still not a secret.
-Yeah, and of course.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.645
Oh. Um...

04:24.645 --> 04:26.096
Come back to me.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.563
My name is Frankie Wong
and I'm addicted

04:32.563 --> 04:35.736
to watching Russian soap operas
with my neighbors.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.698
No! No, Svetlana!

04:37.698 --> 04:40.321
Don't eat that pierogi!
It's poison!

04:42.663 --> 04:44.785
My lie detector's
buzzing a little bit.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.707
Are you telling
the whole truth?

04:46.707 --> 04:48.078
She also cries
every episode.

04:48.078 --> 04:49.790
Dude!

04:49.790 --> 04:53.964
I can't believe
Svetlana ate that pierogi!

04:53.964 --> 04:56.627
She was so young!

04:58.339 --> 04:59.880
It was really sad!

04:59.880 --> 05:02.803
She just got into
ballerina school!

05:02.803 --> 05:05.386
Hey! Spoiler alert!

05:05.386 --> 05:06.687
Just kidding.
I don't care.

05:08.018 --> 05:11.812
Besides, I only watch
when Paige is busy with...

05:11.812 --> 05:14.435
Actually, what are you busy
with on those nights?

05:14.435 --> 05:15.736
Uh...

05:15.736 --> 05:18.198
Excellent.
Circle of Truth transition.

05:18.198 --> 05:21.902
Paige, what do you do
on those nights?

05:21.902 --> 05:23.744
Oh, uh...

05:23.744 --> 05:25.746
I was gonna talk
about how I love

05:25.746 --> 05:26.867
the smell of my own feet.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.909
(chuckles)
Embarrassing!

05:30.581 --> 05:33.834
But those nights, I, um...

05:33.834 --> 05:36.627
read books...
for fun.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.668
Amelia, your turn.

05:37.668 --> 05:39.339
Buzz, buzz, buzz!

05:39.339 --> 05:42.673
Reading books for fun
does not sound like
a thing people do.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.017
Okay. I take a mixed
martial arts class

05:47.017 --> 05:49.640
and I'm really close
to getting my green belt.
Amelia, the goblet is yours.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You take MMA?

05:51.892 --> 05:53.734
I didn't know
anything about that.

05:53.734 --> 05:54.775
It's no big deal.

05:54.775 --> 05:56.607
I-- I didn't think
you'd be into it.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.028
Amelia, seriously?

05:58.028 --> 06:01.782
How have you not embraced
this opportunity to talk
about yourself?

06:01.782 --> 06:03.193
(sighs)

06:06.867 --> 06:10.370
Let's see.
A secret, secret...

06:10.370 --> 06:11.752
Oh, I got one.

06:11.752 --> 06:13.414
I'm worth over
a million dollars.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.255
What?!

06:15.255 --> 06:18.208
Did you say a million?
As in a one?

06:18.208 --> 06:19.920
With a million zeros after it?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.554
Seriously, is nobody worried
about his head injuries?

06:24.805 --> 06:27.057
Just promise me
you guys won't go

06:27.057 --> 06:29.179
acting all weird
about the money thing.

06:29.179 --> 06:32.473
We're friends and this
doesn't change that, right?

06:32.473 --> 06:36.897
Totally.
Also, I just remembered
my real secret.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.780
I love you, Amelia
Whatever Your Last Name Is.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.903
Will you marry me?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.158
Hey, Paige,
before you go,

06:48.158 --> 06:50.120
I just have one question
about your MMA class.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.162
What? I told you the truth.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.794
My parents want me
to get more exercise.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.836
That's why I go there.
No other reason.

06:55.836 --> 06:57.628
No, I was just trying to--

06:57.628 --> 07:00.841
Sure, I could have told Frankie,
but it never came up.
End of discussion.

07:00.841 --> 07:01.752
-Actually, I was just--
-Fine.

07:01.752 --> 07:04.214
She's my best friend,
but I don't want her there.

07:04.214 --> 07:05.425
Is that what
you wanted to hear?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.847
Uh, no.

07:06.847 --> 07:08.849
I was just wondering
if your MMA class

07:08.849 --> 07:10.811
is next to that
frozen yogurt shop

07:10.811 --> 07:12.933
where they mix the fruit in.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.816
Oh, that's what you--

07:15.816 --> 07:18.018
No, you're thinking
of Fro-Yo Dojo.

07:18.018 --> 07:19.399
Oh, right!

07:19.399 --> 07:20.691
Fruit toppings! Hup!

07:21.732 --> 07:23.904
Look, don't tell Frankie.

07:23.904 --> 07:27.698
I love hanging out with her,
but we're always together.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.951
Between school and Vuuugle,
I barely get any Paige Time.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.872
I hear ya.

07:31.872 --> 07:34.334
I go bird calling
every Tuesday by myself.

07:34.334 --> 07:35.706
That's Dirk Time.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.878
And it's sacred.

07:37.878 --> 07:39.500
Yeah, you get it!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.081
Everybody needs
some time alone.

07:41.081 --> 07:42.963
And earning that green belt
is important to me,

07:42.963 --> 07:46.216
but if I told Frankie,
she might take it personally
and get upset.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.930
Last week, I mastered the call
of the red-breasted nuthatch.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.351
It was awesome.

07:51.351 --> 07:54.144
(whistles)

07:54.144 --> 07:55.856
Mep, mep, mep, mep, mep.

07:57.397 --> 07:58.899
You're a complicated dude, Dirk.

08:01.191 --> 08:02.773
(techno music playing)

08:04.655 --> 08:06.366
Jab! Big jab!

08:06.366 --> 08:08.949
Kick! Knee!
(chuckles)

08:08.949 --> 08:10.571
Nice work, Paige.

08:10.571 --> 08:13.744
Work on your hip throw,
and you'll earn your green belt.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.875
Thanks, Sensei.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.957
Maybe someday I'll even
get my black belt

08:16.957 --> 08:18.919
like the Dragon Slayer.

08:18.919 --> 08:22.122
(grunting)

08:22.122 --> 08:24.675
(groans)

08:24.675 --> 08:27.588
Shh! Do not say
his name out loud.

08:27.588 --> 08:29.219
It only invokes his rage.

08:29.219 --> 08:30.591
(grunts)

08:34.765 --> 08:38.097
Whoa! It smells like sweat
and dudes with ponytails

08:38.097 --> 08:40.140
up in here,
am I right?

08:40.140 --> 08:42.522
Frankie? What are
you doing here?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.024
-I joined the class.
-No!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.235
Way!

08:45.235 --> 08:47.487
(chuckles)
No way!

08:47.487 --> 08:48.859
That's great!

08:48.859 --> 08:50.651
Yeah, I heard what you said
in the truth circle.

08:50.651 --> 08:52.613
You wanted to do
this MMA thing together,

08:52.613 --> 08:53.954
but didn't think
I'd be into it.

08:53.954 --> 08:55.616
So, I'm here now.

08:55.616 --> 08:56.997
You don't have to do
this alone anymore.

08:56.997 --> 08:58.619
Aww.

08:58.619 --> 08:59.960
Some!

08:59.960 --> 09:02.252
Awesome!

09:02.252 --> 09:03.794
(grunts)

09:06.126 --> 09:08.799
The kid hasn't paid
for class in five years.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.301
Honestly, I'm afraid
to bring it up.

09:17.638 --> 09:19.179
(grunts)

09:19.179 --> 09:21.181
Good energy, everyone.

09:21.181 --> 09:24.104
Now let's work
on our punches.

09:24.104 --> 09:26.356
(grunts)

09:26.356 --> 09:27.988
(grunts)

09:27.988 --> 09:29.650
M-M-A!

09:29.650 --> 09:30.991
M-M-A!

09:30.991 --> 09:32.903
M-M-A!

09:32.903 --> 09:34.114
-M-M-A!
-Frankie!

09:34.114 --> 09:36.697
-Huh?
-You don't need to say "MMA"
every time you punch.

09:36.697 --> 09:38.578
Then how will my enemy know
what I'm doing?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.911
Knee! Elbow!

09:40.911 --> 09:42.332
Heart rip!

09:43.914 --> 09:45.545
Don't eat the heart!

09:46.967 --> 09:49.589
Well, don't throw it away!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.421
Focus, everybody.

09:51.421 --> 09:52.883
Keep warming up.

09:55.015 --> 09:57.097
Hey, I totally get
why you come here.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.268
-I'm gonna go--
-Great!

09:58.268 --> 09:59.980
I mean, MMA's
not for everybody, so--

09:59.980 --> 10:01.271
No, I'm not leaving.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.523
I'm getting our notebook
so we can write some songs.

10:03.523 --> 10:04.815
This place is hilarious.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.147
♪ I'm a man
with a ponytail ♪

10:07.147 --> 10:10.030
♪ My barber should
be put in jail ♪

10:11.231 --> 10:12.362
(growls)

10:12.362 --> 10:14.534
Uh, she didn't mean it.

10:14.534 --> 10:15.906
Respectful bow.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.077
Respectful bow.

10:22.002 --> 10:23.203
Here comes Amelia.

10:23.203 --> 10:25.505
Act natural.
Don't mention her money.

10:25.505 --> 10:28.168
Please. I know how
to talk to people.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.379
Hey, guys.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.132
You have a million dollars!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.965
What does money smell like?

10:34.965 --> 10:37.177
Can we not talk about me?

10:37.177 --> 10:39.810
Ooh, those words
did not feel right

10:39.810 --> 10:41.061
coming out of my mouth.

10:41.061 --> 10:42.973
No, let's hang out.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.224
Take a load off.

10:44.224 --> 10:45.726
This is reserved for Amelia.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.067
She could buy and sell you.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.068
Now scram.

10:54.074 --> 10:55.866
Do you have enough air?

10:55.866 --> 10:58.328
I can breathe less
if you need more.

10:58.328 --> 10:59.780
No, I'm fine.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.372
Can we just talk
about normal stuff?

11:02.372 --> 11:03.744
Totally.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.246
Have you ever thought
about building your own
roller coaster?

11:06.246 --> 11:07.547
It cost less than you think

11:07.547 --> 11:09.249
if you know where
to cut corners.

11:09.249 --> 11:10.590
Okay.

11:10.590 --> 11:13.003
Uh, let's just get some lunch.

11:13.003 --> 11:14.424
-My treat.
-Really?

11:14.424 --> 11:18.849
You would trade your money
for food? For me?

11:18.849 --> 11:20.560
Um, sure.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.063
That's how I would
describe it to an alien.

11:23.063 --> 11:26.186
But I'm happy to buy lunch
for my friends anytime.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.647
If we weren't already engaged,

11:27.647 --> 11:30.610
I would propose
to you right now.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.080
Oh, there you are.
I'm heading to lunch.
You comin'?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.411
I already ate.

11:41.411 --> 11:42.622
Sensei says I'm close
to getting my green belt,

11:42.622 --> 11:45.035
so I'm working
on my moves. By myself.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.747
Oh, great.
I'll keep you company.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.788
(sighs)

11:47.788 --> 11:49.089
You won't even know I'm here.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.006
(grunts)

11:57.097 --> 11:58.388
(grunts)

11:59.509 --> 12:00.510
(grunts)

12:01.762 --> 12:02.763
(grunts)

12:04.845 --> 12:05.896
(grunts)

12:05.896 --> 12:09.729
Frankie, what's happening
right now?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.853
Oh, just grunting
to help you feel like
you're in MMA class.

12:12.853 --> 12:15.155
(gasps)
Let me add
some techno music.

12:15.155 --> 12:16.526
(beatboxes)

12:16.526 --> 12:18.278
(beatboxing continues)

12:18.278 --> 12:21.281
Ooh! Aah! M-M-A!

12:21.281 --> 12:22.953
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

12:22.953 --> 12:24.744
Oh, I've got sounds
for that too!

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
I'm good.

12:33.373 --> 12:35.085
(bathroom door opens)

12:35.085 --> 12:36.426
Frankie:
Paige!

12:38.218 --> 12:39.429
Paige!

12:40.971 --> 12:42.262
-Paige!
-Aah!

12:43.683 --> 12:45.976
Frankie, what if I was
going to the bathroom?

12:45.976 --> 12:47.307
Well, that would
have been awkward,

12:47.307 --> 12:48.648
especially standing up there.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.943
Hey, I had this great idea
for our "Sensei Ponytail Song."

12:52.943 --> 12:54.154
It's about his dandruff,

12:54.154 --> 12:55.775
but I'm calling it
his man-druff.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.527
Paige (thinking):
 Just tell her the truth.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.399
MMA is Paige Time.

12:59.399 --> 13:01.451
What's the worst
 that could happen?

13:01.451 --> 13:04.164
(screams)

13:06.166 --> 13:08.708
(heart thumping)

13:11.581 --> 13:13.583
Or just bend the truth.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.465
I can't make it
to MMA class tonight.

13:15.465 --> 13:17.878
I just remembered
I have to feed
my grandma's cats.

13:17.878 --> 13:18.969
She's in Florida.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.511
Well, I'm not going
to MMA without you.

13:21.511 --> 13:23.553
Guess it's a Russian
soap opera kind of night.

13:23.553 --> 13:27.227
Boris is about to marry
Svetlana's twin sister
by mistake.

13:27.227 --> 13:28.598
Her name is also Svetlana.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.432
There will be tears.

13:39.279 --> 13:40.901
Hey, Amelia!

13:40.901 --> 13:43.203
Sit down. We just ordered
some chow from a new place.

13:43.203 --> 13:44.244
Great.

13:44.244 --> 13:46.326
I'm just glad
we're all hanging out

13:46.326 --> 13:47.747
and not talking about money.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.951
Dirk:
Sweet! Our lunch is here.

13:50.951 --> 13:53.083
Seven of those lobsters
are mine!

13:57.507 --> 13:59.759
Good. They sent Lenny J.

13:59.759 --> 14:01.131
He's the best.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.883
Play us something smooth, Lenny.

14:03.964 --> 14:06.016
(plays smooth jazz)

14:06.016 --> 14:07.767
Um...

14:07.767 --> 14:09.269
what's going on here?

14:09.269 --> 14:11.601
You said you were fine
with buying lunch for us,

14:11.601 --> 14:14.064
so we ordered lunch.

14:17.737 --> 14:21.151
This bill is for $1,000!

14:21.151 --> 14:23.153
Fine. I got this.

14:27.487 --> 14:28.989
Uh...

14:30.200 --> 14:33.994
Must have left Ol' Leather
in my other pants.

14:33.994 --> 14:35.165
Ya mind?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.208
You're the best, Money!

14:39.379 --> 14:41.171
Did you just call me Money?

14:41.171 --> 14:43.263
Of course not, A-million.

14:43.263 --> 14:45.265
Amel-ion.

14:45.265 --> 14:47.137
Money.

14:48.678 --> 14:53.223
You guys ordered
37 pounds of salami?

14:53.223 --> 14:55.855
That's actually not for lunch.

14:57.227 --> 14:58.648
It's for a dare
I have to do.

14:58.648 --> 15:02.572
You're gonna eat
37 pounds of salami?

15:02.572 --> 15:04.364
That would be crazy!

15:04.364 --> 15:05.575
I'm gonna get pummeled by them.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.028
Salami team!

15:09.289 --> 15:10.290
Go!

15:13.083 --> 15:14.534
I'm an artist!

15:16.706 --> 15:18.298
(techno music playing)

15:21.671 --> 15:22.842
(grunts)

15:22.842 --> 15:24.804
Fantastic form, Paige.

15:24.804 --> 15:26.806
Thank you, Sensei.

15:26.806 --> 15:28.428
Hey, you changed your hair.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.719
Yes.

15:29.719 --> 15:32.262
Your friend's jokes
shamed me into a man bun.

15:40.820 --> 15:41.821
Paige?

15:42.983 --> 15:44.404
Hey!

15:44.404 --> 15:46.326
I thought it was
a Russian soap kind of night.

15:46.326 --> 15:48.989
Yeah, it was a repeat,
so I figured I'd come here
and get a laugh.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.030
Why are you here?

15:50.030 --> 15:54.124
Oh, uh, my aunt got back
from Florida early.

15:54.124 --> 15:55.455
Thought it was your grandma.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.669
Uh, in-- in my family,
we call my grandma...

15:59.669 --> 16:02.292
Aunt Grandma?

16:02.292 --> 16:04.294
Okay, what's going on, Paige?

16:04.294 --> 16:06.426
We're always together.

16:06.426 --> 16:08.388
MMA was Paige Time.

16:08.388 --> 16:10.510
Why can't there be one thing
I do on my own?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.305
Wow. Okay, I thought
we were having fun.

16:15.305 --> 16:17.227
Well, you can have
all the Paige Time you want now.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.308
I'm out of here.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.732
My mom already left!

16:23.773 --> 16:25.695
-(grunts)
-Not in the mood, Ira!

16:29.819 --> 16:31.241
(techno music playing)

16:35.955 --> 16:38.618
Frankie, I don't feel good
about what just happened.

16:38.618 --> 16:40.330
When you told your best friend

16:40.330 --> 16:41.921
you don't want
her around anymore,

16:41.921 --> 16:43.293
you don't feel good about that?

16:43.293 --> 16:44.714
Weird.

16:44.714 --> 16:46.966
Everyone keep warming up.

16:50.430 --> 16:52.722
I love Paige and Frankie,

16:52.722 --> 16:56.306
but I also want to do
some things as just Paige.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.807
You understand what I'm saying?

16:57.807 --> 16:58.808
Yeah, I do.

17:01.481 --> 17:03.193
I would have held it for you,

17:03.193 --> 17:06.695
but I wanted you
to do it as just Paige.

17:06.695 --> 17:08.988
Frankie, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

17:08.988 --> 17:11.281
Oh, now I'm a bad friend
and a bad listener?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.571
What else am I bad at?
Questions?

17:12.571 --> 17:15.115
Am I bad at asking questions?
I don't think so

17:15.115 --> 17:17.707
'cause my inflection
went up and everything!

17:17.707 --> 17:19.749
Love the intensity, ladies.

17:19.749 --> 17:21.461
I need sparring partners.

17:21.461 --> 17:23.623
You two,
center of the dojo.

17:25.925 --> 17:27.297
It's about to be Paige's time

17:27.297 --> 17:28.798
to go down.

17:29.929 --> 17:31.511
-Sparring means fighting, right?
-Yeah!

17:31.511 --> 17:34.514
All right then!
And the dojo is--

17:34.514 --> 17:36.676
-Where we are right now.
-Yeah, it is.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.942
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

17:42.942 --> 17:44.394
Is this a food meeting?

17:44.394 --> 17:47.687
I just read about a place that
sells hundred-dollar hot dogs.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.859
Should I call?

17:49.859 --> 17:51.401
It's not a food meeting.

17:52.992 --> 17:54.364
Here.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.495
Whoa!

17:55.495 --> 17:57.617
$10,000?!

17:57.617 --> 18:00.620
That buys a lot
of hundred-dollar hot dogs!

18:00.620 --> 18:04.164
And even more regular hot dogs!

18:04.164 --> 18:07.006
I've got some big
decisions to make.

18:07.006 --> 18:09.589
Now you have money too.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.881
And that's all
you care about, right?

18:11.881 --> 18:14.594
(suspenseful music plays)

18:14.594 --> 18:16.926
They said it was impossible

18:16.926 --> 18:19.429
to build an indoor
roller coaster

18:19.429 --> 18:21.311
that would go
from your studio,

18:21.311 --> 18:23.933
to the bathroom,
and back.

18:23.933 --> 18:26.436
Well, here we are.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.027
Congratulations.

18:28.027 --> 18:29.569
Thank you, Mayor Roller Coaster.

18:29.569 --> 18:30.610
(chuckles)

18:30.610 --> 18:32.031
-(roller coaster whooshes)
-Here we go!

18:32.031 --> 18:33.363
Whoo!

18:36.826 --> 18:39.289
(suspenseful music plays)

18:40.450 --> 18:43.413
Sorry, you're not tall
enough to ride.

18:44.544 --> 18:46.376
Oh.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.457
Aren't I?

18:49.088 --> 18:50.800
Oh my.
(chuckles)

18:52.212 --> 18:53.923
Right this way, Mr. Schotz.

18:57.597 --> 18:59.098
Amelia, are you sure
about this?

18:59.098 --> 19:00.390
I am.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.182
I was afraid
things would change

19:02.182 --> 19:03.813
once you guys found out
about my money,

19:03.813 --> 19:07.897
and obviously they have,
but I care about both of you

19:07.897 --> 19:09.729
too much to let
this ruin our friendship.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.654
Well, I have to say...

19:14.654 --> 19:15.775
good meeting.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.657
Hang on.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.619
Amelia, we're jerks.

19:19.619 --> 19:22.912
Your friendship means
more than any check.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.624
Thank you, Dirk!

19:24.624 --> 19:26.746
I knew you'd step up
and do the right thing.

19:31.381 --> 19:33.963
I, um...

19:33.963 --> 19:37.677
would also like to apologize.

19:37.677 --> 19:42.222
This money means nothing
without your eternal friendship.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.723
Ffft! Ffft!

19:47.647 --> 19:50.360
Well, I gotta go.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.574
Hello? Bank?

19:54.574 --> 19:56.696
How do I put money in you?

19:58.618 --> 20:00.530
Don't worry. I'll make sure
he rips up the check.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.121
No, it's okay.

20:02.121 --> 20:04.203
Those checks weren't real.
(gasps)

20:04.203 --> 20:06.496
Let's go to the bank
and watch him try to cash it!

20:06.496 --> 20:08.748
He's gonna get arrested so hard!

20:10.420 --> 20:11.881
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

20:14.924 --> 20:16.836
Why'd you lie to me
about this class?

20:16.836 --> 20:18.047
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

20:18.047 --> 20:20.640
I know you.
This about more
than just Paige Time.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.342
You wouldn't understand.

20:27.106 --> 20:29.439
Is somebody gonna
punch somebody?

20:29.439 --> 20:30.730
Ooh!

20:30.730 --> 20:31.851
(chuckles)

20:31.851 --> 20:33.653
Thank you, Dragon Slayer.

20:33.653 --> 20:34.774
You feel me.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.359
No fair!

20:39.359 --> 20:41.160
You can't punch and kick!

20:41.160 --> 20:43.823
-How are you so good at this?
-Because I practice, Frankie.

20:43.823 --> 20:46.286
I study my opponents
and I know their weaknesses.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.037
Oh, well, I know
my opponent's weaknesses too.

20:48.037 --> 20:49.869
-Tickle, tickle.
-(giggles)

20:49.869 --> 20:53.002
Tickle, tickle.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.043
This!

20:54.043 --> 20:56.586
This is why I wanted
MMA to be Paige Time.

20:56.586 --> 20:58.378
I love when we joke
around at school,

20:58.378 --> 20:59.929
I love when we joke
around at Vuuugle,

20:59.929 --> 21:01.641
but MMA isn't a joke to me.

21:01.641 --> 21:02.802
And you just can't get that.

21:02.802 --> 21:04.684
Well, how can
I not make jokes?

21:04.684 --> 21:06.346
This place is like
an angry pajama party.

21:07.347 --> 21:08.478
Who's with me?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.151
Oh, give it up, Ira.

21:12.151 --> 21:14.233
I'm babysitting you tomorrow.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.357
I'm sorry, Frankie.

21:17.357 --> 21:19.609
I should have been honest
with you in the first place.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.661
No, I'm sorry.

21:21.661 --> 21:23.363
This meant a lot to you.

21:23.363 --> 21:25.405
I shouldn't have
ruined Paige Time.

21:27.867 --> 21:30.790
Hey, no hugging
in my dojo.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.752
You know the rules.

21:36.376 --> 21:37.677
You wanna get out of here?

21:37.677 --> 21:39.088
But don't you want
that green belt?

21:39.088 --> 21:40.720
-I can take it.
-Thanks.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.182
(yells)

21:43.182 --> 21:45.304
Fighters:
Ooh.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.929
I meant I could take it
from that little kid!

21:49.929 --> 21:52.271
Why is MMA even a thing?

21:57.437 --> 21:59.739
So let's recap.
Thanks to the Circle of Truth,

21:59.739 --> 22:02.071
Paige and I got in a fight...

22:02.071 --> 22:05.244
Bernie got community service
for cashing a fake check...

22:06.786 --> 22:08.538
Dirk's not getting
a roller coaster...

22:09.749 --> 22:12.291
Amelia blew a thousand bucks
on salami.

22:14.163 --> 22:17.256
All in favor of never doing
the Circle of Truth again?

22:17.256 --> 22:19.839
(all groan)

22:19.839 --> 22:21.961
Good. I gotta go.

22:21.961 --> 22:25.555
I've got trash to pick up
on the side of the highway.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.680
Hey, you comin' to MMA tonight?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.062
You can see me wear this.

22:33.062 --> 22:35.234
I'm proud of you,
but I'm gonna pass.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.236
MMA is Paige Time.

22:37.236 --> 22:39.108
Besides, you gave me
a great idea.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.980
Frankie Time!

22:40.980 --> 22:42.321
Frankie:
Hey, guys.

22:42.321 --> 22:45.034
Russian Soap Opera
Action Figure Collector here.

22:45.034 --> 22:48.828
In today's video,
we're gonna be unboxing Boris,

22:48.828 --> 22:50.750
the lawyer with a dark past

22:50.750 --> 22:54.494
and Sasha, the housewife
turned jewel thief.

22:54.494 --> 22:57.627
(deep voice)
Sasha, you are
my one true love.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.209
(high-pitched voice)
If that is true,
then who is that?

23:01.921 --> 23:03.803
(Southern accent)
I'm Princess Cowgirl.

23:03.803 --> 23:06.806
You stay away from my man
or you will be "Russian"

23:06.806 --> 23:09.138
to get my boot out
of your butt.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.850
(alien voice)
I am Space Princess.

23:10.850 --> 23:12.271
Boris is my man.

23:12.271 --> 23:13.563
Hands off.

23:13.563 --> 23:15.565
Okay, this got weird.

23:15.565 --> 23:16.856
Now I'm out.

23:16.856 --> 23:19.278
Sweet! More toys for me!

23:19.278 --> 23:20.730
(alien voice)
 Boris, I love you!
