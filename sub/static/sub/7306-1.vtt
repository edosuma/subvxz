WEBVTT

01:38.832 --> 01:40.367
Check the heart line.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.135
Are you hyperventilating
the patient?

01:42.136 --> 01:43.604
No, doctor.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.939
Ready the bone wax.
Metzenbaum scissors.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.176
Metzenbaum scissors.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.777
Get that cat out of here.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.911
Yes, sir.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.513
Ready to close. Remove
the Weitlander retractor.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.148
We're closing, doctor.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.116
Remove the Raney clip,
for god's sake.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.518
I appreciate your letting me

01:58.519 --> 02:00.253
observe that
brain operation today.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.821
It would've
been more complicated

02:01.822 --> 02:02.989
if he'd needed one,

02:02.990 --> 02:05.358
but since you wanted to
observe my technique, I...

02:05.359 --> 02:07.560
That was very nice of you.
Doctor, were you, uh,

02:07.561 --> 02:10.263
were you interested
in science as a child?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.998
I don't know if I was interested

02:11.999 --> 02:13.266
so much in the science

02:13.267 --> 02:16.669
as I was the slime
that goes along with it.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.770
Snakes and frogs.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.973
When I saw how slimy
the human brain was, I...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.975
I knew that's what
I wanted to do

02:22.976 --> 02:24.344
with the rest of my life.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.912
What's the matter, Timon?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.714
I thought you liked fish.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.216
They taste funny.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.251
Really? It's fresh.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.086
It came right out of that tank.

02:34.555 --> 02:38.157
You hooked my angel fish?!

02:38.158 --> 02:42.295
Why do you do
these terrible things?

02:42.296 --> 02:45.064
Because I love
to see those veins

02:45.065 --> 02:47.133
in your temple throb.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.237
You... you...

02:50.271 --> 02:52.004
I'll kill you.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.673
Look here, you devil woman,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.142
you'll never do this
to another man!

02:56.143 --> 02:58.278
Oh, yes, I will.
I'll do it,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.580
and I'll do it,
and I'll do it again.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.081
Would you read that back to me?

03:02.082 --> 03:03.383
I'm afraid that might make me

03:03.384 --> 03:04.751
sound pompous to your readers.

03:04.752 --> 03:08.020
Uh, "my brilliant research
in brain transplantation

03:08.021 --> 03:09.456
"is unsurpassed

03:09.457 --> 03:12.459
and will probably make my name
live beyond eternity."

03:12.460 --> 03:14.060
No, that's all right.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.362
Take out the "probably."

03:15.363 --> 03:17.964
It makes me sound
wishy-washy.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.634
You take your hands off me,
you impotent prune!

03:21.635 --> 03:24.004
Ohh!

03:28.041 --> 03:30.810
My Renoir!
I'll kill you!

03:30.811 --> 03:33.346
I get so excited
when you get angry.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.581
It makes me feel so much closer

03:34.582 --> 03:36.349
to the reading of the will.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.351
You won't get a penny.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.187
I changed my will months ago.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.722
You son of a bitch.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.191
Well, I guess I'll
just have to find me

03:45.192 --> 03:46.426
a new man to torture.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.760
Dr. Furrier...

03:47.761 --> 03:49.128
That's... Hfuhruhurr.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.129
I'm sorry.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.197
That's all right.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.465
A lot of people mispronounce it,

03:52.466 --> 03:54.301
but it sounds just
the way it's spelled.

03:54.302 --> 03:59.071
H-f-u-h-r-u-h-u-r-r.
Hfuhruhurr.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.707
Hfuhruhurr-rur.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.476
That's good. You just went
a little past it there.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.346
Just put the brakes on
a little sooner.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.349
Doctor, I, uh...
I know you were quite shaken

04:09.350 --> 04:11.451
by the tragic death
of your wife.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.886
Oh, I couldn't talk
about it for a long while,

04:13.887 --> 04:17.490
but... Time passes by,
and I can handle it now.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.091
Her name was Rebecca.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.495
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

04:22.496 --> 04:25.865
Is Ookums having
a massive heart attack?

04:25.866 --> 04:30.102
What a shame, with me
so young and hot!

04:30.103 --> 04:31.204
Pom-pom!

04:33.173 --> 04:34.775
Rip her throat out!

04:36.143 --> 04:38.779
Aah!

04:41.248 --> 04:44.250
Why?! Why?! Why?!
Why?! Why?! Why?!

04:44.251 --> 04:45.318
Dr. Furrier!

04:45.319 --> 04:47.387
Hfuhruhurr!

04:47.388 --> 04:49.722
I'm sorry.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.091
She was...

04:52.092 --> 04:53.693
Everything.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.362
Is that her?

04:55.363 --> 04:58.498
No. That's just
a statue of her.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.933
Our gardener Ramon, he...

05:00.934 --> 05:04.471
He made made that
for me after she...

05:04.472 --> 05:07.206
I love the way her head moves.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.943
She almost looks...
Alive.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.745
Watch out!

05:12.746 --> 05:14.415
Bye-bye!

05:29.363 --> 05:30.831
An angel.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.333
Little girl?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.735
Yes, sir?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.705
I want you to do something
very important, all right?

05:38.706 --> 05:39.972
OK.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.774
I want you to run home,
and I want you to call the E.R.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.777
of North Bank General Hospital,
932 1000.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.513
Tell them to set up O.R. 6 immediately

05:46.514 --> 05:49.148
and contact anesthesiologist
Isadore Tourick,

05:49.149 --> 05:51.784
472 2112, beep 12.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.886
Have them send an ambulance
with a paramedic crew,

05:53.887 --> 05:56.856
light IV, D-5 and W, KVO.
You got it?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.659
E.R., North Bank
General Hospital,

05:59.660 --> 06:01.193
932 1000.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.462
Set up O.R. 6,

06:02.463 --> 06:05.164
contact anesthesiologist
Isadore Tourick,

06:05.165 --> 06:07.834
472 2112, beep 12.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.336
Ambulance with paramedics
and light IV,

06:10.337 --> 06:12.371
D-5 and W, KVO.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.540
That's good.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.509
Sounds like a subdural
hematoma to me.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.777
Oh, it does, does it?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.546
Well, it's not your job
to diagnose.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.813
But I thought...

06:20.814 --> 06:22.615
You thought! You thought!
Just go!

06:22.616 --> 06:24.951
3 years of nursery school,
and you think you know it all!

06:24.952 --> 06:26.719
Well, you're still wet
behind the ears.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.689
It's not a subdural hematoma!
It's epidural! Hah!

06:29.690 --> 06:31.525
Goddamn, that makes me mad.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.838
I don't find this amusing,
Garrero!

06:45.839 --> 06:48.007
This is a better story
than I ever hoped for.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.909
Beautiful woman
gets hit by a car

06:49.910 --> 06:52.344
and needs brain surgery,
and the man who hits her

06:52.345 --> 06:53.913
is the world's greatest
brain surgeon

06:53.914 --> 06:55.582
who operates on her
and saves her life.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.550
If I save her life,
Olsen. If.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.019
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Brandon?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.187
Ah, yes, Michael.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.322
This operation that
you're about to perform,

07:03.323 --> 07:05.157
I feel,
is very ill-advised.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.193
No surgeon should ever
operate on a patient

07:07.194 --> 07:08.728
that he has personally injured.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.697
It would make him
too emotionally involved.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.599
Don't you think
I'm aware of that?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.000
But there's only one
other person I'd trust

07:14.001 --> 07:16.002
to perform this
operation... Beckermann.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.938
Dr. Beckermann was murdered
in Europe. You know that.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.972
Exactly!

07:19.973 --> 07:24.745
Not only is he dead,
he's 6,000 miles away.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.520
What is that?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.355
It's a vagina.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.357
I know what it is.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.292
I mean what are you doing?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.828
Shaving her.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.864
This is a brain operation.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.899
I know.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.901
What's that supposed
to be, a heart?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.670
Yes, sir.
Clive and I thought

07:50.671 --> 07:53.507
that since it's
Valentine's day that...

08:00.881 --> 08:03.049
You don't have to
shave her anywhere.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.651
We'll be using
my cranial screwtop

08:04.652 --> 08:06.252
method of entry into the brain.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.286
Fine. Yes, sir.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.689
I never want to see that again.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.691
I suppose if it were Christmas,

08:11.692 --> 08:13.927
you'd hang ornaments on it.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.608
Forceps.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.144
Metzenbaum scissors.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.515
10-blade scalpel.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.318
10-blade.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.621
Sponge stick.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.159
Give me a little sweat
on my upper lip.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.097
Remove sweat.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.611
Cover her breasts.
I'm a man, flesh and blood.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.082
Scat!

09:09.883 --> 09:12.218
Damn!
The cats around here.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.888
Cranial screwtop.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.337
Now all we can do is wait.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.873
Yes.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.153
Where am I?

09:47.154 --> 09:49.622
In a hospital.
You've had an accident.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.924
Oh.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.393
I hope I haven't
caused any trouble.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.362
Oh, no.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.797
I'm so tired.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.632
Shh shh shh shh.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.033
Who are you?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.135
Oh,
I'm... I'm your doctor.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.004
I want...

10:04.005 --> 10:06.173
Oh, don't...
Don't try and talk.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.346
Doctor.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.514
Huh?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.718
You're wanted in O.R. 6
in 5 minutes.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.020
Thank you.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.958
Ohh. Continue
the Dilantin IV.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.222
What a skull.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.693
Ohh.

11:00.694 --> 11:04.031
Boy, would I like
to jump on those bones.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.700
Rebecca.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.903
I can't help
comparing her to you.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.905
She has a behind so sexy

11:12.906 --> 11:15.775
you'd like to eat lunch off it.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.745
Just like we did, remember?

11:18.746 --> 11:21.013
Rebecca.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.449
I've had the top
of her head off,

11:23.450 --> 11:25.818
but that's as far as it went.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.587
I promise I'll never recite
our favorite poem

11:28.588 --> 11:31.490
to anyone but you.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.426
In Dilman's grove.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.765
In Dilman's grove,
my love did die,

11:38.766 --> 11:41.468
and now in ground,
she'll ever lie.

11:42.635 --> 11:46.172
None could e'er
replace her visage,

11:46.173 --> 11:48.074
until your face

11:48.075 --> 11:49.943
brought thoughts of kissage.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.092
Nurse.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.659
Good.
I'm glad you're here.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.761
Make a note.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.931
Right arm grip strength
very good.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.769
Left arm's... there's
just no improvement.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.110
I went out
and got you a little present.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.883
"The complete poems
of John Lilyson."

12:32.219 --> 12:34.720
"England's greatest
one-armed poet"?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.688
He wrote in Dilman's grove

12:36.689 --> 12:39.391
and pointy birds.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.894
I...

12:44.832 --> 12:46.098
"oh, pointy birds,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.700
"oh, pointy, pointy,

12:48.701 --> 12:50.569
"anoint my head,

12:50.570 --> 12:51.971
anointy, 'nointy."

12:51.972 --> 12:54.440
He died in 1894.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.477
He was the first person
ever to be hit by a car.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.713
To think you were
almost killed by a car.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.515
Michael.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.385
That's all over now.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.721
That man you ran away
from that night...

13:09.722 --> 13:11.925
Poor old Mr. Creswell.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.197
It was all my fault, in a way.

13:18.265 --> 13:22.001
I never should have
gone there alone.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.536
I guess I'm just too trusting.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.007
Oh, poor little bird.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.409
So fragile.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.611
So naive.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.313
So childlike.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.482
So shy.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.817
So chaste.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.453
So innocent.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.024
Rebecca.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.292
If there's anything wrong

13:46.293 --> 13:48.827
with my feelings for Dolores,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.229
just give me a sign.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.498
No!

13:52.499 --> 13:54.200
No!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.302
No!

13:56.303 --> 13:57.636
No!

13:57.637 --> 13:59.438
No!

13:59.439 --> 14:01.373
No!

14:01.374 --> 14:03.109
No!

14:03.110 --> 14:04.643
No!

14:04.644 --> 14:06.812
No!

14:06.813 --> 14:08.414
No!

14:08.415 --> 14:10.149
No!

14:10.150 --> 14:11.817
No!

14:11.818 --> 14:14.053
No!

14:14.054 --> 14:16.755
Just any kind of sign.

14:16.756 --> 14:20.026
I'll keep on the lookout for it.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.228
Meanwhile, I'll just
put you in the closet.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.663
In sickness or in health

14:24.664 --> 14:27.333
till death do you part?

14:27.334 --> 14:28.334
I do.

14:28.335 --> 14:32.104
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.141
You may kiss the bride.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.115
Not now.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.701
There it is, darling.
Your new home.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.138
The house of hfuhruhurr.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.075
What are those assholes
doing on the porch?

15:09.076 --> 15:12.644
Those aren't assholes.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.982
It's pronounced "azaleas."

15:16.683 --> 15:19.851
I put them there for you.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.253
Señor.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.855
No, Ramon.
My wife will not be

15:23.856 --> 15:26.059
entering her new home
in a wheelchair.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.611
I want this moment
to last forever.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.786
Señor?

15:54.787 --> 15:58.390
Señor, would you like to
eat your breakfast now?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.092
Have you taken enough
photos of the moment

16:00.093 --> 16:02.594
so we can remember
this moment forever?

16:02.595 --> 16:03.496
Oh, yes.

16:03.497 --> 16:05.497
And we got them
back already. See?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.632
Oh, that's nice.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.101
All right, breakfast.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.171
We'll get cleaned up first.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.874
One of my favorite people
in the world

16:15.875 --> 16:18.044
is about to walk out here.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.412
I'm happy to say he is
still busy making his...

16:20.413 --> 16:22.514
Look, I framed the moment.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.649
Mm-hmm.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.718
He's now about to
unveil his latest picture,

16:26.719 --> 16:28.520
which I hear is just amazing,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.857
opening on the 21st
of this month...

16:38.031 --> 16:39.598
Yuck.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.999
Wait. Turn that back.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
That's my favorite movie.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.569
That's Donovan's brain.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.637
And not the slightest
sign of decay?

16:45.638 --> 16:48.107
None. I've never seen
healthier tissue.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.642
It's growing larger by the day.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.878
It's disgusting.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.913
Brains are so ugly.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.216
No. It's beautiful.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.218
I'm late!

16:59.219 --> 17:01.253
Is that all you're
gonna have for breakfast?

17:01.254 --> 17:02.854
It's all I have time for.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.123
How do you feel?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.824
Oh, I'm fine.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.727
I just... Wish I could
get out of this wheelchair

17:08.728 --> 17:11.597
so I could help a little
around the house.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.565
You will.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.233
You just had a major operation.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.034
It takes time to recover.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.203
You're gonna be up
and around in no time.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.771
Just be patient.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.510
Dolores? Soon?

17:25.778 --> 17:27.547
Huh?

17:30.016 --> 17:31.017
Huh?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.707
Forgot my hat.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.942
Ooh! Ohh!

17:56.943 --> 18:00.112
You walked! You walked!
You walked!

18:00.113 --> 18:03.482
I shouldn't have gotten up,

18:03.483 --> 18:04.883
but I wanted to surprise you

18:04.884 --> 18:07.586
and walk into your arms
tonight when you came home.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.223
You walked! You walked!
You walked!

18:11.224 --> 18:13.359
I love you so much.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.893
Who is that man out there?

18:14.894 --> 18:17.028
Juan.
He works for Ramon.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.797
Oh. He frightened me.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.500
He's just a big,
good-natured bag of muscles.

18:21.501 --> 18:25.036
There's just something about him
that makes me quiver.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.772
Is he here often?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.607
Just one day a week.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.841
What day?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.343
Tuesday.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.811
Is he ever alone?

18:32.812 --> 18:37.883
I mean, does Ramon ever go off
and leave him here alone?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.385
Sometimes. Why?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.653
I'd like to know.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.791
Please, tell Ramon to warn me

18:45.792 --> 18:49.228
when he's gonna leave me
alone with that Juan person.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.663
All right, if that'll
make you feel better.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.965
That'll make me
feel much better.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.803
Frightened little mouse.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.276
I'll tell Ramon

19:04.277 --> 19:07.614
to warn her about Juan.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.217
Ramon!

19:11.218 --> 19:14.052
Michael, Michael,
how is married life?

19:14.053 --> 19:15.053
I don't know!

19:15.054 --> 19:17.055
I'm sorry.
I've been on edge

19:17.056 --> 19:18.924
the last couple of weeks.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.892
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:20.893 --> 19:21.893
Michael!

19:21.894 --> 19:23.695
Aah!

19:23.696 --> 19:25.497
See? That's
a perfect example.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.166
Oh, god, I almost peed
in the scrub basin.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.269
I don't know why
I've been so tense.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.872
Maybe it's your coffee.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.642
No.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.178
When a woman who's just
had major brain surgery

19:40.179 --> 19:41.847
tells you she has a headache,

19:41.848 --> 19:42.881
you've got to listen.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.451
Oh.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.852
Patience, Michael.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.355
A recently married woman
and an eager young husband...

19:49.356 --> 19:51.757
It won't be long
before you hear her say,

19:51.758 --> 19:53.693
"take me! Take me!"

19:54.727 --> 19:56.663
Take me.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.733
Take me.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.339
Ohh.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.208
Ohh, Juan.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.778
You...

20:13.380 --> 20:14.513
You're through!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.282
I don't think I am.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.484
Not you.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.821
By the way, I fired
Ramon yesterday.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.592
Ramon? But Ramon is such
a fine man. What did he do?

20:26.593 --> 20:29.995
He came up behind me,
and he grabbed my breasts.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.265
What?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.101
I haven't even done that yet.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.803
I know. I told him that.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.137
You told him?

20:39.138 --> 20:41.407
He said he had to measure me

20:41.408 --> 20:42.808
for a new dashboard ornament.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.944
He told me he had to
measure Rebecca a lot

20:45.945 --> 20:47.814
before he got her right.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.754
Oh, you're upset.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.625
So am I.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.829
I want to be everything
to you Rebecca was.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.901
I want to give you...
Everything she gave you,

21:09.902 --> 21:12.739
do everything she did.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.243
When can you start?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.612
How soon can you get home?

21:20.613 --> 21:24.115
Well, I have 2 operations,
but I can do them fast.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.985
They're just brain operations.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.322
Let me get my hat.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.591
My briefcase.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.367
Could you walk me to the door?

21:48.941 --> 21:50.409
What's he doing?

21:50.410 --> 21:53.412
2 brain operations
at the same time.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.413
Number 11-blade.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.414
11-blade.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.415
10-blade scalpel.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.616
10-blade.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.085
Ready the bone wax.
Metzenbaum scissors.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.087
Metzenbaum scissors.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.221
Get that cat out of here.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.823
Yes, sir.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.026
We're ready to close.
Cranial screwtops.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.898
Check for stripping.
Take them to SICU.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.502
Bravo!
Bravo!

22:22.942 --> 22:24.309
You're so early.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.377
Yes.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.580
Take off your coat.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.384
And your paper hat.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.920
I'm chilling some wine for us.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.187
Why don't you open it?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.457
Yes.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.081
Does this do anything for you?

23:03.082 --> 23:04.816
Oh, yes.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.852
Good.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.959
I want our first night
together...

23:13.960 --> 23:15.093
To be exciting.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.428
I do, too.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.732
I hope the waiting
hasn't been too hard on you.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.603
There's something
I have to tell you.

23:24.604 --> 23:27.706
This fits very snug,

23:27.707 --> 23:31.042
and you may have some trouble
getting it off me.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.311
You may have to
tear it off my body.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.483
I can tear.
I like tearing.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.121
You... Man of steel.

23:48.628 --> 23:52.031
I can't wait till next Thursday.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.270
Today is Monday.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.472
I know.

24:00.473 --> 24:04.242
But my headache
should be gone by then.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.277
You don't mind waiting, do you?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.279
Oh. No.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.682
No, no, no.
Not at all.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.784
I have a little headache myself.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.152
Maybe I'll take a walk.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.823
It'll do me good.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.960
Where's my hat?

24:22.028 --> 24:23.896
It's...

24:29.135 --> 24:30.970
The breeze feels good.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.839
You wanted to see me?

24:33.840 --> 24:37.643
Michael, I'm, uh,
concerned about you.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.946
Really?
What's the concern?

24:41.247 --> 24:44.382
My staff tells me that you've
been a little tense lately.

24:44.383 --> 24:45.585
Tense?

24:48.688 --> 24:51.557
Is that what they say about me?

24:51.558 --> 24:55.460
Michael, even to me,
you seem a little jumpy.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.728
Jumpy?!

24:56.729 --> 24:58.263
How are things at home, Michael?

24:58.264 --> 25:01.132
Great. I'm married to the most
beautiful woman in the world.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.434
How could it be anything
but great?!

25:03.435 --> 25:05.704
It's gonna be even greater!

25:05.705 --> 25:07.874
Just as soon as we...

25:09.275 --> 25:12.343
6 weeks and you haven't
made love to your wife yet?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.812
No wonder you're tense.

25:13.813 --> 25:17.515
Dr. Brandon, the woman has
just had major brain surgery.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.086
She's had enough unpleasantness.

25:21.988 --> 25:25.624
I'll have you know that in
the finger-sucking department

25:25.625 --> 25:29.161
I am extremely satisfied.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.101
Have you ever been
to Austria, Michael?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.036
No.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.737
The Austrian institute
of Craniology

25:38.738 --> 25:40.772
has asked many times
for you to lecture there

25:40.773 --> 25:43.508
on your theory
of brain transplants.

25:43.509 --> 25:45.510
Why not take them up on it?

25:45.511 --> 25:48.980
Combine a business trip
with a honeymoon.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.882
Honeymoon.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.185
Yeah. I got to do something
to get us started.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.253
When are you scheduled

25:55.254 --> 25:57.222
to have your hands
removed from your face?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.356
3:00 this afternoon.

25:58.357 --> 25:59.658
Then you could do
the Voigtlander surgery for me.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.992
Of course!

26:00.993 --> 26:03.561
Have to be very careful
with that instant glue.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.696
I know.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.164
Here's the Voigtlander chart.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.399
A honeymoon.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.870
Yeah. Honeymoon!

26:31.590 --> 26:32.791
May I help you, sir?

26:32.792 --> 26:34.192
Yes, I'm Dr. hfuhruhurr.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.961
I believe you're holding
a room for me.

26:35.962 --> 26:42.034
Yes. Would you prefer
a double or twin beds?

26:45.171 --> 26:47.372
A double.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.708
Ah, a double.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.877
Could you send up
a bottle of champagne

26:51.878 --> 26:54.112
and put a "do not disturb"
on the phone

26:54.113 --> 26:56.948
for the next...
Um, let's see.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.751
We go in, put our bags down
start kissing,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.352
be about 7 minutes.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.789
Move into the bedroom,
slide my hands over her dress,

27:03.790 --> 27:06.858
I remove her blouse,
maybe 4 or 5 minutes.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.828
Move over to the bed,
rub each inner thigh,

27:09.829 --> 27:11.830
that would be 4 minutes each,

27:11.831 --> 27:14.233
so I figure 25 minutes
of foreplay in general...

27:15.702 --> 27:21.072
Do you call oral sex
foreplay or actual sex?

27:21.073 --> 27:24.142
Doesn't matter.
I'd like to do it twice,

27:24.143 --> 27:26.311
so at least 3 hours, all right?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.714
3 hours?!

27:28.715 --> 27:30.750
Yes, sir.

27:32.284 --> 27:36.487
Take Mrs. hfuhruhurr and
that lucky son of a bitch

27:36.488 --> 27:39.157
up to suite 729.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.626
Yes, sir.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.798
I never in
my wildest imagination

27:46.799 --> 27:49.835
ever thought it
could be like that.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.971
It was the most exciting
sexual encounter...

27:52.972 --> 27:56.975
without actually having it...

27:56.976 --> 28:01.247
that I ever almost had.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.390
Doctor, I'm
Dr. Felix Conrad.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.925
I'll be escorting you
to the lecture hall.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.526
Did you just step off
that elevator?

28:15.527 --> 28:16.795
There was no operator.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.496
They're all afraid.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.565
You haven't heard about
Vienna's elevator killer?

28:20.566 --> 28:21.933
Elevator killer?

28:21.934 --> 28:24.702
People have been getting
on elevators on one floor

28:24.703 --> 28:27.572
only to arrive at
another floor dead.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.840
Like Beckerman.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.409
Ja. Dr. Sclermie
Beckerman.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.444
A brilliant brain surgeon.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.646
One of your colleagues.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.182
It was a great loss.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.616
I'm thankful you're all right.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.018
The academy is looking forward

28:40.019 --> 28:41.753
to hearing you
lecture this morning.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.354
I hope I don't ruffle
any feathers.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.091
My speech might be a little
radical for the old guard.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.093
It would take quite a bit

28:48.094 --> 28:50.261
to shock any of this crowd.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.064
Ladies and gentlemen,
I can envision a day

28:53.065 --> 28:55.466
when the brains of brilliant men

28:55.467 --> 28:58.838
can be kept alive in
the bodies of dumb people.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.509
What are they saying?

29:04.510 --> 29:07.645
They're just saying
"murmur murmur murmur."

29:07.646 --> 29:09.647
It's just sort of
a general murmur?

29:09.648 --> 29:11.449
Yeah. Murmur.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.251
Oh.

29:12.252 --> 29:15.621
You may murmur all you like...

29:18.925 --> 29:20.992
but to make
transplantation possible

29:20.993 --> 29:23.862
I have recently invented
the cranial screwtop method

29:23.863 --> 29:27.265
of entry into the brain
whereby a large section

29:27.266 --> 29:31.436
can be unscrewed without
having to shave the head.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.139
And as a safety feature,
I've made it childproof.

29:34.140 --> 29:38.544
To open, you push down
while turning...

29:40.880 --> 29:44.750
And voila, the human brain.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.158
Where is this man's brain?

29:53.159 --> 29:55.560
Stolen! It's the fourth
incident this month.

29:55.561 --> 29:59.030
I wish to apologize to
our American colleague.

29:59.031 --> 30:02.334
This demonstration
is now concluded.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.377
Dr. hmfhruhrr?

30:12.378 --> 30:13.912
It's close. Yes?

30:13.913 --> 30:17.482
I'm Dr. Alfred Necessiter.

30:17.483 --> 30:21.186
Well, well, well.
Dr. Alfred Necessiter.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.088
Would you like a drink?

30:23.089 --> 30:25.590
A drink would be interesting.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.726
I enjoyed your lecture today.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.729
What lecture? They gave me
a head with 3 lemons in it.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.531
That's why I enjoyed it so much.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.800
I didn't have to hear your
brilliant but old-fashioned

30:35.801 --> 30:37.335
theories on the human brain.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.703
What do you mean,
"old-fashioned"?

30:38.704 --> 30:41.973
I'm the most advanced
brain man working today.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.274
I don't think so.

30:43.275 --> 30:47.345
Read this article.
Look at the underlined part.

30:47.346 --> 30:51.918
And look at this. Read
the caption under the photo.

30:53.886 --> 30:57.122
And these...
Newsweek, Time, Cosmo.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.223
National Enquirer...

30:58.224 --> 31:00.158
Dolly Parton wants
to have my baby.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.160
Don't tell me
I'm old-fashioned.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.162
I didn't mean
to upset you, doctor!

31:04.163 --> 31:06.331
You're the most brilliant
brain man working today.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.100
That's why I'm most anxious
to share my work with you.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.102
It seems you're the one person
in the entire universe

31:11.103 --> 31:12.803
who might understand it.

31:12.804 --> 31:16.541
And I agree with what
you said here.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.510
"My brilliant research
in brain transplantation

31:19.511 --> 31:22.713
"is unsurpassed and will
probably make my name

31:22.714 --> 31:26.417
live beyond eternity."

31:26.418 --> 31:29.754
I told him to take out
the "probably."

31:29.755 --> 31:31.722
My laboratory
is set up in my home.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.892
If you have a moment,
I could show you my work.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.927
When?

31:35.928 --> 31:38.363
Now!

31:38.364 --> 31:40.131
All right.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.667
I can't believe they didn't
take out the "probably."

31:42.668 --> 31:45.671
You know, that photograph
doesn't do you justice.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.951
Well, hello.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.087
I didn't expect to see you here.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.324
Ow! Oh, you dirty...

32:13.232 --> 32:15.233
What's the matter?

32:15.234 --> 32:17.235
You'll have to forgive me.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.371
Being in Austria and meeting
a scientist with your interests,

32:20.372 --> 32:24.909
I half expected your laboratory
to be in a castle, not a condo.

32:24.910 --> 32:27.778
You mean... Like this?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.848
Yeah.
That's more like it.

32:30.849 --> 32:32.418
Jesus.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.123
This is extraordinary.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.825
From the outside,
it does not look this roomy.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.094
I had a good decorator.
My wife.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.563
It's amazing what she did
with a few throw pillows,

32:45.564 --> 32:47.999
some wallpaper,
and a staple gun.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Leapin' lizards.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.436
Yes. We have those.

32:53.939 --> 32:55.006
Moat with alligator...

32:55.007 --> 32:58.376
Here's our small entrance hall.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.578
Do you have enough closet space?

33:00.579 --> 33:01.979
There never is.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.781
No. They fill up
so fast.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.016
This is the TV room.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.485
Oh, I love the way
it's so dreary.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.887
This, doctor...

33:09.888 --> 33:11.690
Is my laboratory.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.230
Brains.

33:19.231 --> 33:24.370
I've never seen so many brains
out of their heads before.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.039
Feel like a kid
in a candy store.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.342
Don't touch it!

33:31.343 --> 33:32.144
Why?

33:32.145 --> 33:35.047
They're alive.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.051
Alive.

33:41.887 --> 33:45.923
But there's no wires or tubes
or that "bzz" thing.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.325
How are they kept alive?

33:47.326 --> 33:49.528
With a special fluid
I developed.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.902
Why do you have
all these brains?

33:57.903 --> 34:01.239
My vision is to be able to take

34:01.240 --> 34:04.475
the thoughts and data
from a dying brain

34:04.476 --> 34:07.945
and transfer them
into another body

34:07.946 --> 34:11.217
without opening the skull.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.021
Would you care for a drink?

34:17.022 --> 34:18.123
Please.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.524
What would you like?

34:19.525 --> 34:20.991
A Tahitian lady.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.793
Right-o.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.094
Flaming?

34:24.096 --> 34:26.964
Oh, no, no.
That's for tourists.

34:26.965 --> 34:28.699
Where do you get your brains?

34:28.699 --> 34:29.800
The city morgue.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.170
For a nice tip they send
me brains from bodies

34:32.170 --> 34:34.205
that have died in the right way.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.041
What is the right way
for a body to die?

34:37.042 --> 34:40.043
For my purpose,
an injection of 200 ccs

34:40.045 --> 34:41.911
of ammoniated strychnoclorahype

34:41.913 --> 34:43.880
into the buttocks,

34:43.882 --> 34:47.685
causing the brain to die last.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.520
Thank you.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.522
Ammoniated strych...
that's window cleaner.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.024
That's the exact ingredients
in window cleaner.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.527
Yes.

34:59.831 --> 35:04.068
And who does the injecting,
Dr. Necessiter, you?

35:04.069 --> 35:06.471
Good lord, no.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.939
It's the elevator killer,
bless his heart.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.210
You're condoning murder,
aren't you, Dr. Necessiter?

35:12.211 --> 35:14.379
As long at it's happening,
I'm happy to accept it.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.381
The only time we doctors
should accept death

35:16.382 --> 35:18.549
is when it's caused
by our own incompetence.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.419
Nonsense! If the murder
of 12 innocent people

35:21.420 --> 35:23.954
can save one human life,
it will have been worth it.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.424
Worth it?
You're condoning murder!

35:26.425 --> 35:28.393
I'm not condoning murder, sir!

35:28.394 --> 35:30.395
Shut up in there!

35:30.396 --> 35:32.129
Research and murder
do not go together!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.098
And you shut up!

35:34.099 --> 35:36.501
With your TV blaring all night

35:36.502 --> 35:39.371
and your 6 grandchildren
running down the halls!

35:41.173 --> 35:44.175
I'm sorry, doctor.
These walls look solid,

35:44.176 --> 35:46.611
but they're thin
as tissue paper.

35:46.612 --> 35:51.349
That's typical for a condo.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.351
Now, let me show you

35:53.352 --> 35:56.321
how far I've progressed
with my experiments.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.256
You knew a Sclermie Beckerman?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.258
You've got Sclermie
in one of those jars

36:00.259 --> 36:01.659
like so much marmalade?

36:01.660 --> 36:05.663
No! He isn't in a jar!
He's walking and talking.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.064
That's impossible.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.233
I saw photos of the body.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.702
It is possible.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.305
I must warn you, doctor...

36:14.306 --> 36:17.308
What you are about to see...

36:17.309 --> 36:21.313
Might strike you as
the most incredible, awesome...

36:22.848 --> 36:24.415
Excuse me.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.883
Incredible, awesome what?

36:25.884 --> 36:28.419
Just a minute.
Hello? Yes?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.087
I'll be there immediately.
Thank you.

36:30.088 --> 36:31.389
What was that awesome thing?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.558
I must leave now.
I have a new brain to pick.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.825
The elevator killer
has struck again.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.395
What about Beckerman
and incredible?

36:37.396 --> 36:40.298
Come for dinner tonight
and bring Mrs. Furrear.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.066
Hfuhruhurr.
Hfuhruhurr.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.570
8:00. You can let
yourself out.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.666
Now, if you will
just turn around.

37:18.036 --> 37:21.473
Und lift your robe.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.285
Ja.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.336
Hi. What's going on?

37:51.337 --> 37:52.737
Don't interfere.

37:52.738 --> 37:57.275
He's paying me $15,000
just to touch my behind.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.210
You! Get outta here!

38:00.211 --> 38:01.211
Please, forgive...

38:01.212 --> 38:02.681
Get out!

38:03.649 --> 38:05.950
This kind of thing
could ruin our marriage.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.387
Why? Because you
don't want me to work?

38:09.388 --> 38:12.189
Earn my own money?
Have my own career?

38:12.190 --> 38:13.924
You call this a career?

38:13.925 --> 38:17.227
Oh, I've made those veins
in your temple throb.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.864
Oh, I love that.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.800
Ha ha ha!

38:22.801 --> 38:26.771
Dolores, our marriage
lies broken on the floor

38:26.772 --> 38:29.607
like the shards of glass
on our honeymoon suite!

38:29.608 --> 38:33.678
Aah! Oh! 19th century
Indian rubber vase, eh?

38:33.679 --> 38:38.282
Dolores, I am making
a citizen's divorce.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.450
What?

38:39.451 --> 38:41.552
By the powers vested in me,

38:41.553 --> 38:46.491
I hereby declare our
marriage null and void!

38:46.492 --> 38:48.627
E Pluribus Unum!

38:52.998 --> 38:54.164
Jawohl?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.367
I'm Dr.Hfuhruhurr.

38:56.368 --> 39:00.405
Dr. hfurrrr... oh, ja.

39:00.406 --> 39:03.541
You and your wife
are expected for dinner.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.476
My wife won't be coming.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.711
Oh. I trust
she is not ill.

39:06.712 --> 39:10.314
She's not ill.
She's a cheap, vulgar slut!

39:10.315 --> 39:12.183
Ja, I've heard this.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.521
Dr. hfuhruhurr, please.

39:16.522 --> 39:20.024
No, I'm sorry, he's not in.
This is Mrs. hfurrr... Ff.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.593
I'm James Gladstone,
calling from New York.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.994
I'm the attorney

39:23.995 --> 39:26.831
for Dr. hfuhruhurr's
step-grandmother.

39:26.832 --> 39:29.299
I wanted to inform
the doctor of her passing.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.535
Passing what?

39:30.536 --> 39:33.003
She was cremated this afternoon.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.606
We need the doctor's
signature on some documents

39:35.607 --> 39:37.943
before we release
his share of the estate.

39:40.345 --> 39:42.112
Um...

39:42.113 --> 39:45.551
How big is the estate?

40:02.768 --> 40:04.770
Rebecca...

40:06.605 --> 40:09.441
Why didn't you give me a sign?

40:12.077 --> 40:14.546
I miss you.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.849
The fun we had.

40:24.389 --> 40:25.556
Remember our song?

40:25.557 --> 40:28.493

Hello?

42:07.192 --> 42:08.827
Hello?

42:11.062 --> 42:12.997
Is this a joke?

42:12.998 --> 42:13.998
What?

42:13.999 --> 42:15.666
Is this a joke?

42:15.667 --> 42:20.204
Who are you?
What's happening?

42:20.205 --> 42:22.607
I don't know.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.341
Who are you?

42:24.342 --> 42:26.276
Dr. Michael
hfuhruhurr.

42:26.277 --> 42:30.080
Dr. hfuhruhurr?

42:30.081 --> 42:31.481
My god.

42:31.482 --> 42:32.950
What?

42:32.951 --> 42:37.788
You're the first... Object
that ever pronounced it right.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.757
How else could you pronounce it?

42:39.758 --> 42:43.527
H-f-u-h-r-u-h-u-r-r,
isn't it?

42:43.528 --> 42:46.964
Yes!

42:46.965 --> 42:48.398
Who are you?

42:48.399 --> 42:52.637
Anne. Anne Uumellmahaye.

42:52.638 --> 42:57.708
U-u-m-e-l-l-m-a-h-a-y-e?
Uumellmahaye?

42:57.709 --> 43:01.378
Yes. Where am I?
It's so dark.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.781
In a doctor's laboratory.

43:03.782 --> 43:07.151
Am I all right?

43:07.152 --> 43:11.488
Um... Not really.

43:11.489 --> 43:15.726
Will I be able to play
the piano again?

43:15.727 --> 43:20.097
Um, I would think... no.

43:20.098 --> 43:23.500
Why did you call me an object?

43:23.501 --> 43:25.936
I'm sorry.

43:25.937 --> 43:30.574
I didn't know
what else to call you.

43:30.575 --> 43:33.210
Why?

43:33.211 --> 43:34.544
You don't know?

43:34.545 --> 43:36.546
No, I don't.

43:36.547 --> 43:38.683
Please, tell me.

43:38.684 --> 43:41.385
Well...

43:41.386 --> 43:45.956
Miss uumellmahaye, it seems
that you have no body.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.292
What happened to my body?

43:48.293 --> 43:49.960
It's dead. Gone.

43:49.961 --> 43:55.299
You're a disembodied brain
kept alive by a scientist.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.234
But we're talking.

43:57.235 --> 44:02.339
I must at least have lips,
a tongue, a throat.

44:02.340 --> 44:05.342
Nothing.
Just a jar.

44:05.343 --> 44:09.213
Oh! Oh!

44:09.214 --> 44:12.249
Don't cry.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.651
But how can I hear you?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.854
Must be some kind of telepathy.

44:16.855 --> 44:18.222
What's going to happen to me?

44:18.223 --> 44:23.193
Hans told me
you were here. Good, good.

44:23.194 --> 44:26.130
Now, let me show you

44:26.131 --> 44:29.099
that experiment
I've been working on.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.001
No! No.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.803
I've got something
more important.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.272
Listen, just listen.

44:35.273 --> 44:37.007
All right, sing.

44:37.008 --> 44:41.278
♪ If you like-a me
like I like-a you ♪

44:41.279 --> 44:45.883
♪ And we like-a both
the same ♪

44:45.884 --> 44:47.918
♪ I like-a say... ♪

44:47.919 --> 44:50.587
Have you heard anything
like that in your life?

44:50.588 --> 44:51.722
I can't hear a thing.

44:51.723 --> 44:53.623
Oh, really?

44:53.624 --> 44:54.624
Shh.

44:54.625 --> 44:55.793
What were you doing?

44:55.794 --> 44:58.896
I was just working
on my new technique

44:58.897 --> 45:00.898
for walking in corduroy pants

45:00.899 --> 45:04.668
to eliminate the scraping
when your thighs rub together.

45:04.669 --> 45:07.772
That's very
exciting work, doctor.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.674
Now, come on. Let me
show you what I've done

45:10.675 --> 45:12.710
for your friend Beckerman.

45:15.013 --> 45:17.282
Whup.
Just one moment.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.118
What happened?

45:21.119 --> 45:23.520
No one can hear you but me.

45:23.521 --> 45:26.390
Doctor!

45:26.391 --> 45:27.391
Did you hear that?

45:27.392 --> 45:28.193
No.

45:28.194 --> 45:30.895
You can't hear anyone but me.

45:30.896 --> 45:33.563
It is some kind of telepathy.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.865
I'm frightened.

45:34.866 --> 45:37.234
Don't be. Things are never
as bad as they seem.

45:37.235 --> 45:40.805
You still have your...
Brain.

45:40.806 --> 45:42.739
Dr. hfuhruhurr!

45:42.740 --> 45:44.909
I'll be back.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.945
Just stay here.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.616
I believe you know
this gentleman.

45:52.617 --> 45:55.285
Is that
Dr. Beckerman?

45:55.286 --> 45:58.588
Sort of. See,
I've devised a machine

45:58.589 --> 46:01.959
that can transfer the entire
contents of one brain

46:01.960 --> 46:03.393
into another brain.
Understand, of course,

46:03.394 --> 46:05.729
that the brain of a gorilla
is smaller than a human's,

46:05.730 --> 46:08.432
so much of Dr. Beckerman's
vast knowledge

46:08.433 --> 46:10.467
couldn't be accommodated.

46:10.468 --> 46:11.602
Dr. Beckerman?

46:15.640 --> 46:17.407
That's him all right.

46:17.408 --> 46:20.411
We never did like to
shake hands with him.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.113
He must be lonely.

46:23.114 --> 46:26.650
Perhaps soon we'll
find him a companion.

46:26.651 --> 46:28.019
Come, doctor.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.026
Bye.

46:40.966 --> 46:42.199
I'm going up to pack my clothes.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.700
Can you send the bellman
up in 10 minutes?

46:43.701 --> 46:44.903
Yes, sir.

47:15.566 --> 47:16.901
"My darling husband,

47:16.902 --> 47:20.437
"by the time you read this
I will be dead.

47:20.438 --> 47:23.007
"My only regret
is that I caused you pain.

47:23.008 --> 47:24.308
"I hope my insurance money

47:24.309 --> 47:26.276
"brings you some happiness.

47:26.277 --> 47:29.146
"May I burn in hell for
what I have done to you.

47:29.147 --> 47:30.881
"My broken body will be lying

47:30.882 --> 47:33.417
"7 floors below.

47:33.418 --> 47:34.718
"Au revoir,

47:34.719 --> 47:36.653
Dolores."

47:36.654 --> 47:38.722
Aah!

47:38.723 --> 47:40.025
No!

47:45.330 --> 47:46.363
You're alive!

47:46.364 --> 47:47.365
Yes.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.666
But the scream...

47:49.667 --> 47:50.868
I was rehearsing.

47:51.802 --> 47:53.803
Don't come near me.

47:53.804 --> 47:54.838
Why are you doing this?

47:54.839 --> 47:56.773
Because I'm evil.

47:56.774 --> 47:58.309
You're not evil.
You're sick.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.477
Sick?

48:00.478 --> 48:01.578
Yes, from the operation.

48:01.579 --> 48:03.747
Just screw your head on
a little bit tighter.

48:03.748 --> 48:05.015
You can be well.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.850
It's no use, Michael.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.718
I'm no good for you.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.587
And, besides,

48:10.588 --> 48:11.456
you divorced me.

48:11.457 --> 48:13.857
I'm making
a citizen's annulment.

48:13.858 --> 48:16.594
Ipso Facto, coitus interruptus.

48:18.063 --> 48:19.163
I'm coming to get you.

48:19.164 --> 48:21.065
No! Stay where you are.

48:21.066 --> 48:24.501
I can't stand hurting you
anymore, Michael.

48:24.502 --> 48:25.669
Good-bye, my darling.

48:25.670 --> 48:26.671
No!

48:58.836 --> 49:00.705
Take my hand.

49:04.842 --> 49:06.511
You're safe
with me now. Aah!

49:07.912 --> 49:10.515
Put your arms around my neck.

49:15.153 --> 49:19.957
I hope this is strong enough
for the both of us.

49:24.529 --> 49:25.996
Hang on.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.732
Uhh!

49:32.403 --> 49:33.404
Uhh!

49:34.272 --> 49:35.672
I don't have any more saliva.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.375
I need yours.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.147
Uhh!

49:43.148 --> 49:45.615
You're all right now.

49:45.616 --> 49:47.118
Oh!
There.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.189
You're going to the hospital.

49:52.190 --> 49:54.192
No, Michael, please.

49:54.992 --> 49:58.196
I want to make it up to you.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.099
When? Thursday?

50:02.100 --> 50:03.701
How about Monday?

50:04.969 --> 50:06.002
Next Monday?

50:06.003 --> 50:07.003
Today, Monday.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.004
Later today?

50:08.005 --> 50:09.039
Now.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.674
Right now or later now?

50:10.675 --> 50:11.841
Now now.

50:11.842 --> 50:13.711
Wow, wow.

50:37.268 --> 50:40.137
Oh, I love a clean, smooth,

50:40.138 --> 50:42.206
hairless chest.

50:42.207 --> 50:44.007
I mean hairy.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.210
Hairy.

50:55.986 --> 50:59.190
I never knew
it could be like that.

51:00.258 --> 51:02.327
Oh, it was so...

51:03.661 --> 51:04.795
So...

51:06.697 --> 51:08.433
Professional.

51:11.369 --> 51:15.573
We are finally united under
the holy laws of matrimony...

51:16.774 --> 51:18.142
In sickness

51:18.143 --> 51:19.943
and in health,

51:19.944 --> 51:21.146
till death...

51:25.850 --> 51:27.452
Do us part.

51:34.992 --> 51:36.261
Help!

51:39.464 --> 51:40.498
Help!

51:43.701 --> 51:44.802
Help!

51:48.539 --> 51:49.939
Help!

51:49.940 --> 51:51.142
Help!

52:12.230 --> 52:14.364
Dr. hfuhruhurr.

52:14.365 --> 52:15.965
Is Dr. Necessiter in?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.867
No, sir.

52:17.868 --> 52:19.102
May I wait for him?

52:19.103 --> 52:20.405
Yes.

52:29.280 --> 52:32.115
I meant, may I wait inside?

52:32.116 --> 52:33.318
Ja.

52:37.355 --> 52:39.088
May I wait in the laboratory?

52:39.089 --> 52:40.824
Oh, I'm afraid it's locked, sir,

52:40.825 --> 52:44.662
but you are welcome
to wait in the den.

52:50.100 --> 52:52.336
Make yourself comfortable, sir.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.871
Perhaps I could
bring you a drink?

52:54.872 --> 52:57.874
Yes. Uh,
Tahiti tingle.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.443
A tingle.

52:59.444 --> 53:00.744
And take your time.

53:00.745 --> 53:02.280
Ah.

53:08.486 --> 53:09.487
Damn.

53:19.930 --> 53:22.866
Aah!

53:22.867 --> 53:25.168
Are you all right, sir?

53:25.169 --> 53:26.570
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.137
I just leaned against the door.

53:28.138 --> 53:30.808
The doors in this condo
are paper-thin.

53:33.077 --> 53:35.279
Everything today
is made so cheap.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.648
Here, look at this wall...

53:39.083 --> 53:40.584
Like paper.

53:40.585 --> 53:43.287
Here is your drink, sir.

53:43.288 --> 53:44.488
Thank you.

53:44.489 --> 53:46.456
Now can I get you
anything else, doctor?

53:46.457 --> 53:48.458
I am about to retire.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.994
Really?
You seem so young.

53:51.729 --> 53:55.064
No. I mean retire
for the night.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.166
Oh. Oh, no, thanks,
I'm fine.

53:57.167 --> 53:59.469
And don't worry about this.

53:59.470 --> 54:02.740
I'll have it replaced
in the morning.

54:05.810 --> 54:07.378
Miss uumellmahaye?

54:11.215 --> 54:12.749
Miss uumellmahaye?

54:12.750 --> 54:14.183
Dr. hfuhruhurr?

54:14.184 --> 54:15.819
Miss uumellmahaye?

54:15.820 --> 54:17.622
Dr. hfuhruhurr?

54:21.459 --> 54:22.793
Dr. hfuhruhurr.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.297
No.

54:27.197 --> 54:28.399
No.

54:31.802 --> 54:32.603
Dr. hfuhruhurr,

54:32.604 --> 54:34.905
what's happened to me?

54:36.874 --> 54:39.643
You're a gorilla.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.545
I don't feel like a gorilla.

54:41.546 --> 54:44.914
Well, you sure do look like one.

54:44.915 --> 54:46.316
But I... I can't be.

54:46.317 --> 54:49.419
I can't see or touch...

54:49.420 --> 54:51.521
Or anything.

54:51.522 --> 54:53.924
Miss uumellmahaye?

54:57.127 --> 54:58.729
Call me Anne.

54:59.864 --> 55:01.164
Thank god.

55:01.165 --> 55:02.732
You're still a brain.

55:02.733 --> 55:03.733
Oops!

55:03.734 --> 55:05.301
Hey!

55:05.302 --> 55:08.271
Why did you think
I was a gorilla?

55:08.272 --> 55:09.873
Because that's what
Dr. Necessiter

55:09.874 --> 55:11.476
has planned for you.

55:12.377 --> 55:13.877
But don't worry.

55:13.878 --> 55:15.580
I have other plans.

55:50.948 --> 55:52.816
You're in my room now.

55:52.817 --> 55:54.183
Where in your room?

55:54.184 --> 55:55.386
In a...

55:57.455 --> 55:59.456
On a gold leaf Florentine table

55:59.457 --> 56:01.391
by the window,

56:01.392 --> 56:03.460
overlooking a garden.

56:03.461 --> 56:06.831
Oh, I can almost
smell the flowers.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.734
Phew.

56:12.269 --> 56:13.336
Sleep well, Anne.

56:13.337 --> 56:16.073
Good night, Michael.

56:18.275 --> 56:19.544
Good night.

56:24.549 --> 56:25.782
Mmm.
You getting up?

56:25.783 --> 56:27.817
Yeah, yeah, just getting up.

56:27.818 --> 56:29.352
Ahh.

56:29.353 --> 56:30.654
I'll order us some breakfast.

56:30.655 --> 56:33.790
Yeah. Order me 2 sheets
of bacon and a pillow.

56:33.791 --> 56:34.792
Hmm?

56:38.596 --> 56:39.796
Hey, know what
I've been thinking?

56:39.797 --> 56:41.798
There's no need
to rush home right now.

56:41.799 --> 56:43.366
I'm due for a sabbatical,

56:43.367 --> 56:44.468
and there's a lot
of experimentation

56:44.469 --> 56:45.735
going on in this city...

56:45.736 --> 56:47.737
A lot of scientists,
a lot of brain research.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.038
You know, I could go out
and look for a cottage,

56:49.039 --> 56:50.807
and I could set up
a little laboratory.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.041
We could be very, very
comfortable there.

56:52.042 --> 56:53.677
What do you think
of an idea like that?

56:53.678 --> 56:56.312
You think I should go out
and look for one right now?

56:56.313 --> 56:57.647
Whatever you want.

56:57.648 --> 56:59.883
Do you want me to go with you?

56:59.884 --> 57:01.184
No, no, that's not
necessary, really.

57:01.185 --> 57:02.185
Oh, but I'd love to.

57:02.186 --> 57:03.319
Oh, it's so much trouble,

57:03.320 --> 57:04.320
the driving

57:04.321 --> 57:05.922
and the realtors.

57:05.923 --> 57:06.724
Yes?

57:06.724 --> 57:07.558
May I take the table?

57:07.559 --> 57:08.559
Oh, yeah, come on in.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.826
It's really...

57:09.827 --> 57:11.327
Ahem.

57:11.328 --> 57:12.395
Madame.

57:12.396 --> 57:13.564
Oh, you're right.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.300
I'd just be in the way.

57:17.301 --> 57:18.668
It's best.

57:18.669 --> 57:21.505
I think I'll just

57:21.506 --> 57:22.972
slip...

57:22.973 --> 57:25.074
Out of these clothes

57:25.075 --> 57:27.911
into a hot bath.

57:27.912 --> 57:29.145
That's great.

57:29.146 --> 57:30.146
That's great.

57:30.147 --> 57:31.482
Yep.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.226
Ahem.
You must be Dr. hfuhruhurr.

57:43.227 --> 57:45.461
Hfuhruhurr, yes.

57:45.462 --> 57:46.596
Can I give you a hand, sir?

57:46.597 --> 57:47.597
No, I'm fine.

57:47.598 --> 57:49.599
What do you have there?

57:49.600 --> 57:52.435
You have a cute little
kitty cat in there?

57:52.436 --> 57:53.703
Hello, katze.

57:53.704 --> 57:55.438
Peekaboo.
I see you.

57:55.439 --> 57:56.806
Ah, that's cute...

57:56.807 --> 57:58.509
All curled up
in the little ball.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.410
Oh, you have
no hair. Ohh!

58:01.411 --> 58:02.846
Sorry. Um...

58:02.847 --> 58:04.714
I'd like to see the house.

58:04.715 --> 58:06.517
Sure.

58:09.587 --> 58:11.555
Guess what?

58:11.556 --> 58:12.822
I found us a cottage,

58:12.823 --> 58:14.090
and I think we ought
to go there right away.

58:14.091 --> 58:15.224
Well, what's the rush?

58:15.225 --> 58:16.292
Well, I set up an experiment,

58:16.293 --> 58:17.426
and I told it I'd be right back.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.029
Oh, you're dressed.
Good.

58:24.268 --> 58:25.434
I'll go get the car.

58:25.435 --> 58:26.637
Let's go!

58:29.574 --> 58:31.107
Why are you driving so fast?

58:31.108 --> 58:34.443
I just want to show you
our new home.

58:34.444 --> 58:36.312
What is this experiment
you're doing?

58:36.313 --> 58:38.014
Just some boring brain stuff.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.616
Oh, you're not going
to have mice and rats

58:39.617 --> 58:40.650
in the house, are you?

58:40.651 --> 58:42.586
No, no.
Just some microscopes

58:42.587 --> 58:44.453
and test tubes and beakers

58:44.454 --> 58:46.856
and maybe a brain.

58:46.857 --> 58:47.924
A brain?

58:47.925 --> 58:49.258
Just a small 4-pounder.
You'll never see it.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.260
I'll keep it locked up.

58:53.998 --> 58:56.299
Ruth was
the greatest baseball player

58:56.300 --> 58:57.902
of all time.

58:58.703 --> 59:01.270
You never saw Ruth play.

59:01.271 --> 59:02.706
On film, I did.

59:02.707 --> 59:04.941
Michael, are you on the phone?

59:04.942 --> 59:06.076
Uh, yes.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.279
Well, I'm waiting for you...

59:10.280 --> 59:11.715
In bed.

59:11.716 --> 59:14.851
We'll finish this tomorrow.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.753
Michael, it was fun tonight.

59:16.754 --> 59:18.689
It was fun for me, too.

59:41.912 --> 59:44.047
Don't you want to make love?

59:44.048 --> 59:45.514
Oh, yeah, yeah.

59:45.515 --> 59:47.183
That'd be great.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.217
I'll take this off.

59:48.218 --> 59:52.256
No, no, no. I can...
I can work around it.

59:55.292 --> 59:57.361
Oh, that feels so...

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.298
Over.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:11.775
What?

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:12.909
Are you going to be
in there forever?

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.078
Uh-huh.
I mean, uh, no, no.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:18.014
Just another couple of days.

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:19.649
Oh.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.117
Well, I guess
I'll just go to town

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.652
and try and find
something to do.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:23.653
Oh, don't go.

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.890
Bye, darling.

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:31.360
I can spend
the whole day with you.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.662
Are you busy?

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.664
Yes, but I'll
cancel my appointments.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:37.967
The whole day.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.102
I don't think there's a girl

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:40.837
floating in any jar anywhere

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:43.640
who's as happy as I am.

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.911
Oh, Michael,
you do so much for me,

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:49.746
and I do nothing for you.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.115
Are you out of your head?

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.483
I'm sorry.
I forgot.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.785
As far as I'm concerned,

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.320
you're the most complete
woman I've ever known.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.588
All my life, I wanted women
with great bodies...

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.425
Women who were 10s.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.193
And now...

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.895
For the first time,

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:08.664
I'm aroused by a mind.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.933
Michael,

01:01:09.934 --> 01:01:11.467
I wish I could kiss you.

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:13.169
I've been thinking about that.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.503
Really?

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.840
Yes, really.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:18.208
I, uh...

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.913
I bought you a pair of wax lips.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.785
I was going to stick them
on your jar.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.053
Is that crazy?

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.320
Oh, no.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:32.723
Please.

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.764
How do I look?

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.146
Michael?
Yes?

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.248
Were you out on the lake today

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.417
kissing your brain?

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.021
No.

01:02:04.022 --> 01:02:05.221
You didn't take the rowboat out?

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.689
Funny.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.357
There was a man out there,

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.894
looked just like you,
kissing a brain.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:11.895
Must've been somebody else.

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:12.996
Somebody else?

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:14.764
How many men are there
around here,

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:16.966
do you suppose, who look
exactly like you

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:18.768
and have brains in jars?

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:20.236
Oh...

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.772
Well, around here,
must be hundreds.

01:02:22.773 --> 01:02:24.340
Oh, stop it, Michael.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:25.674
I know there's something
weird going on

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.243
with you and that brain.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.244
It's not weird.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.245
It's my work.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.313
Oh.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:33.682
It's your work to kiss
a dead brain?

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.651
She's not dead.
She's alive.

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:37.286
So, now it's a she!

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.722
You care more about
that brain than you do me.

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:41.490
Michael, I am your cook,

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.659
your maid, your lover.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.261
I'm understanding
about your work.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.530
I almost threw myself out
a window because of you.

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.065
And you,

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:52.101
you treat me like a doormat.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:52.903
Dolores,

01:02:52.904 --> 01:02:54.939
I'm sorry.
I... I just...

01:02:57.207 --> 01:03:00.576
I didn't realize
what I was doing to you.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.045
Hello?

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:03.679
Who?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.182
Mr. Gladstone?

01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:07.784
What message?

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:10.420
What?

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.291
Grandma Nooney died?

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.932
No, she didn't tell me.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.768
How much?

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.404
15 million.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.374
First thing Monday.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:37.080
The day you learned
about my inheritance

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.747
is the day you started
to be nice to me.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.316
What a coincidence.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.886
You only stayed around
for the money.

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:45.754
What other reason
could there possibly be?

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.256
God!

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:49.392
It's citizen's divorce time!

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:50.961
Final decree!

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:59.069
Ugh. Son of a bitch.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.213
Ooh!

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:17.988
Help!

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:22.226
Help!

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.763
Anne?

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:29.033
Help!

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.035
Where's my brain?

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.236
How should I know?

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:34.437
I'm busy.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:38.074
I'm cooking cervelles
au beurre noir.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.176
Cervelles au beurre noir?

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:42.111
I know what that is.

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:44.480
I had that once when I was
in the army in France.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:45.614
It was a small café.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.750
I was young. I was impetuous.
I'd eat anything.

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:49.518
Cervelles au beurre noir...

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:51.121
That's... that's...
That...

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:54.959
Brains in black butter!

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.562
Ow! Ooh! Ahh! Ohh!

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:00.997
OK, Anne.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.131
Oh, please say something.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.933
Uhh, I think I'm all right.

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:05.801
Count to 10.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:07.470
1, 2, 3,

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:08.837
4, 5, 6,

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:09.872
7, 8...

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:10.874
10.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:13.742
You!

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:17.280
You cooked her 9s.

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:18.148
Out!

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:19.049
Out of my house!

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.416
Out of my life!

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.651
If you lay one finger
on me, I'll kill you!

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.852
You kill me, and I'll see

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.454
that you never work
in this town again!

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:28.691
Nobody's going to keep me
from working in this town!

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.194
Ha!

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.397
Goddamn!

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:35.831
Uhh!
Uhh!

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:37.500
My balls!

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:38.701
Ow!

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.769
Ow!

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.071
I'll get you!

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:43.572
I'll get you for this!

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:47.143
I'll get you for this,
you nigger-kike-wop!

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.412
Into the mud, scum queen!

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:50.414
Aah!

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:54.083
You'll never get
a penny of that inheritance.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:55.284
First thing Monday,
I'm donating it

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.554
to cranial research
for the poor.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.990
By Monday,

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:03.027
you'll be dead!

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.828
Anne.

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:07.031
Anne.

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:12.435
Michael, who did you
call a scum queen?

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:13.569
Oh...

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.305
Just some scum queen.

01:06:16.173 --> 01:06:18.174
I'm frightened, Michael.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.476
I feel so strange.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.112
I feel the world slipping away.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.748
If only we could be together...

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.384
Really together.

01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:30.387
We can, darling.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:32.788
Oh, we can.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.257
Dr. Necessiter,

01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:36.359
I want to become a brain.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.460
What are you talking about?

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:39.262
I want you to build
a tank for 2.

01:06:39.263 --> 01:06:41.764
I want you to put me in
with Anne uumellmahaye.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.032
Anne Uumellma-who?

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.000
Uumellmahaye.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.169
Brain 21, to you.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:48.604
So, you're the one
who stole brain 21.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:49.605
Where is it?

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.108
In the trunk of my car.

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:55.611
I told her it was a box seat
at the Vienna opera.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.946
Here are my instruments.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.283
Do I understand you correctly?

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:02.651
You want me to remove your brain

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:04.887
and put it in a tank
with number 21?

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:06.922
Yes! We can
communicate.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.124
We're in love.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.625
That's the only way
we can be together.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.994
Put me in a tank.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.697
There is an alternative.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.565
As you know, my research
has advanced to a point

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:21.504
where I can put her mind
into the body of a gorilla.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.506
I couldn't fuck a gorilla.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:24.441
Yes, I know,

01:07:24.442 --> 01:07:27.276
but there is one other
alternative...

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:28.544
A human subject.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.079
Are you saying you can
place her thoughts

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.347
in another woman's body?

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:34.016
In the past week,
I've had 2 near successes.

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:35.017
What do you mean near successes?

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:36.452
In my recovery room

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:39.689
are 2 subjects
who do nothing but this...

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.559
But I think I've solved
the problem!

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.027
What kind of life would that be?

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:46.496
This is my wife.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.599
Oh, I know her.
She'd hate that.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.967
I'd rather keep her in a jar.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:53.269
You wouldn't have her
there for long.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.937
What do you mean?

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:56.939
It's a miracle
she's still alive.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.574
She's outlived
every brain I've had.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:02.211
You'll be lucky
if she survives the weekend.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.946
All right.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:04.980
What do I have to do?

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.982
Wait.

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:08.184
Wait for what?

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.319
For the elevator killer
to strike again.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.157
Anne could be dead by then.

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:15.658
I'll check the hospital,

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:16.526
the morgue...

01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:18.694
Everywhere dead bodies hang out.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:20.962
I'll get her a body.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:22.298
I'll prepare the laboratory,

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:23.666
and in case
you're not successful,

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:25.734
I'll have the gorilla
wired and ready.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:26.569
I'll get a body!

01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:28.337
Will this do?

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:33.609
She just...

01:08:33.611 --> 01:08:35.944
She just doesn't have any...

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.147
Va-voom.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.716
She is dead, you know.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.386
Still...

01:08:43.187 --> 01:08:45.621
You don't like anything here?

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.825
No. Nothing really
leaps out at me.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.130
Ooh.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.267
Action's stiff.

01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:01.270
I can file down that sear pin.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.938
Let me have a box of dumdums.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.308
They're illegal, madam.

01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:08.478
So is killing your husband.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.691
Oh, if she were only dead.

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.026
Aah!

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:25.929
Yeah!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.568
She is dead.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.903
Let me through.
I'm a doctor.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:35.904
I'm a doctor.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.005
You're too late.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.106
Good.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.308
I mean, oh.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.176
She's beautiful.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.380
She's perfect.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.913
She's alive.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.316
She's dead. She's dead.

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:48.452
She's got to be dead!

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.187
Dead, dead, dead.

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:57.761
Crazy maniac!

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.851
Need a body.
Yeah.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.563
"In Dilman's grove,

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.064
"my love

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.634
did die."

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:56.420
Driver...

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.822
Follow that car.

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:11.326
Beautiful.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:14.531
Where can I see the rest of you?

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.967
Mama.

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:22.471
Where can we go?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:25.173
Well, we can go to my room.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.909
It's on the fourth floor.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.276
My name's Fran.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.778
I'm an American.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.614
I guess you could say I'm
a member of the piece corps.

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:33.215
Get it?

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:34.750
What is it?

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:35.552
My voice?

01:12:35.553 --> 01:12:37.620
Did I blow the deal?

01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:40.122
I knew I shouldn't talk
until I make the deal.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.690
I know my voice is terrible.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:42.925
It irritates people so much

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:45.628
they usually just want
to kill me.

01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:47.295
Keep talking.
Keep talking.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.698
Oh, good.
I never get to talk.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.502
My whole family loves to talk.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:04.647
Come on in, honey,

01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:06.482
and make yourself at home.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.083
I'll, uh...

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.652

01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:55.864
Yes.

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:57.099
Yes.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.100
Kill.

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.167
Kill.

Kill, kill, kill.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:11.446
Kill her. Yes, yes.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.181
I can't.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.783
Can't what?

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.652
I can't inject you
with window cleaner.

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:17.854
I don't mind.

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:20.989
Hey, what does it do, anyway?

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.125
It causes your brain
to die last.

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.193
I don't mind.

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.863
It's my voice.

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:28.865
Damn.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.076
Well...

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:43.479
What are you doing here?

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:01.897
Dolores.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:02.898
You.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.768
You're the elevator killer.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.838
Merv Griffin.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:10.840
Yeah.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:13.609
Why?

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.778
I don't know. I've always
just loved to kill.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:17.646
I've really enjoyed it.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:18.781
But then I got famous,

01:15:18.782 --> 01:15:20.816
and it's just too hard for me.

01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:22.050
I mean, so many witnesses.

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:23.819
I mean, everybody recognized me.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.654
I couldn't even lurk anymore.

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.723
I'd hear, "who's that
lurking over there?

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:28.857
Isn't that merv Griffin?"

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.059
So I came to Europe to kill,

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.930
and it's really worked out
very well for me...

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.132
Until now.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:44.673
She's beautiful.

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:45.674
Yeah, isn't she?

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:46.942
This may be the one thing

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.911
that saves our marriage.

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:50.478
Hey, you going to turn me in?

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:51.680
I don't have time.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.681
You're going to have
to turn yourself in.

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.250
Promise me.
I promise.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.756
I am never taking you
anywhere again.

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.705
Anne, are you all right?

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.506
I'm very...

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.642
Very sleepy.

01:16:19.643 --> 01:16:20.643
Anne,

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:22.010
stay awake.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:24.713
Look, I got
merv Griffin's autograph.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.114
I'm sleepy.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:27.116
Oh, my god.

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:40.328
Michael...

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.997
Anne, stay with me.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:42.899
Soon.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.801
Help me. Soon we'll
be together.

01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:05.321
Huh?

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.624
Oh, I'm sorry, officer.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.493
Oh, you speak English?

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:12.696
Good.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.534
That's better. We have
more room down there now.

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:20.737
License?

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.909
Doctor...

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:28.276
Hfuhruhurr?

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.178
Yes.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:31.213
What's the rush?

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.681
And what's the matter with her?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:34.116
She's just drunk...

01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:35.117
Dead drunk.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:36.251
Uh-huh.

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.220
And you?

01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:38.887
You have a little
to drink, too, hmm?

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.222
Oh, no, no, no, I dron't dink.

01:17:40.223 --> 01:17:41.223
Don't drink.

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.225
Mm-hmm.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.394
Get out of the car.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:49.965
Stretch out your arms

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:53.002
and touch your nose
with your finger.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.872
Hmm.

01:17:56.906 --> 01:17:59.275
Now walk this white line.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.747
Halt!

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:06.581
Come back.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:08.184
On your hands!

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:12.722
One hand.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:19.963
Now do roll over, turn
over, and flip-flop.

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:25.133
All right.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:28.103
Now juggle these,
do a tap dance, and sing

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:31.840
the Catalina Magdalena
Lupensteiner Wallabeiner song.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.443
Goddamn, your
drunk tests are hard.

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:36.578
♪ Catalina Magdalena ♪

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:37.846
♪ Lupensteiner
Wallabeiner ♪

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.482
♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's her name? ♪

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:43.718
All right, you're not drunk.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.553
You can go.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.890
My oranges.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.160
Now drive carefully.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.195
Wait!

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:54.196
She's not drunk.

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:55.197
She's dead!

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:56.231
Dead? My god,

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.768
I better get her
to a cemetery right away.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:03.973
Oh, my god. Ohh!

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:12.281
Ja. Jawohl.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.951
Very sleepy.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:18.521
Anne, don't go to sleep.
Walk around. Walk around.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:22.724
Rote Mercedes.

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:25.028
Das es das. Schnell!

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:27.897
Schnell, schnell, dumkopf.

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:35.171
Halten, halten.

01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:08.437
Come on.

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:10.939
Bar that door.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.441
Yes, sir.

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.080
Necessiter!

01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:19.882
Schmidt, we need
a battering ram.

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:21.317
Right away, inspector.

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:24.887
Ja?

01:20:24.888 --> 01:20:26.588
Excuse me. Could we
borrow a battering ram?

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:27.589
You'll return it?

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:28.823
Ja.
Gut.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.960
Hurry, hurry!

01:20:35.899 --> 01:20:37.165
One...

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.633
2...

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:41.370
3!

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:52.514
On 3!

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.149
One...

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:55.650
2...

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:56.886
3!

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:01.124
Aah!
Aah!

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:11.066
Dr. necessiter!

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.768
Cheer up, dear boy.
Have a drink.

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:15.003
There's no time for drinks.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:16.271
Anne is dying.

01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:19.074
You're dying, I'm dying,
my machine is dying.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:20.342
My wonderful machine.

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:22.144
What are you talking about?

01:21:22.145 --> 01:21:25.447
It won't start.
It's broken.

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:28.250
Well, there must be
some way to fix it.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:29.884
Aah!

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.153
Ooh!

01:21:31.154 --> 01:21:33.322
Inspector, inspector.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:38.460
Dr. necessiter.

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:39.995
The transformer
of your machine...

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:41.196
Are you aware
it's coin-operated?

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:43.498
Good lord.
I forgot all about that.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.969
When I built the machine
I used the guts of a video game.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:48.136
Quarters, quarters.

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.471
I've got 6 quarters.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.675
Just enough
for the transference.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.311
All right?

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.312
All right.

01:21:57.313 --> 01:21:58.114
All right?

01:21:58.115 --> 01:21:59.881
All right.

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:01.183
Ready now.

01:22:01.184 --> 01:22:03.251
Set the hemofarcal
overload, .6.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.721
Hemofarcal
overload, .6.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:11.259
Septum ludegation
factor 03.5.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:15.998
Septum ludegation
factor 03.5.

01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:18.300
Aortic petrification
ratio 2 over 5.

01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:21.504
Aortic petrification
ratio 2 over 5.

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:26.641
Set the theramin at 1945.

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:29.078
Theramin, 1945.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:37.320
Activate main transference
number 2.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.889
It's open!
Return the ram!

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.992
Here is your ram.
Thank you.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:45.493
Follow me.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:46.494
10...

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:47.529
9...

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:49.497
8...

01:22:49.498 --> 01:22:51.234
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

01:22:56.872 --> 01:22:59.674
Stop! You're under
arrest for murder.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:00.908
We are not murdering!

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:02.477
We are resurrecting!

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:04.046
Moving life from one body
to another!

01:23:04.047 --> 01:23:05.847
You are playing god!

01:23:05.848 --> 01:23:07.382
Somebody has to!

01:23:07.383 --> 01:23:08.616
The dogmas of the quiet past

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:11.019
are inadequate
for the stormy present!

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.521
The occasion is piled high
with difficulty,

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:16.058
and we must rise
to the occasion!

01:23:16.059 --> 01:23:18.626
Whoo! For copies
of this speech,

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:23.765
send one dollar to box 3912,
stone mountain, Georgia!

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:25.467
He's crazy.
No.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:26.769
Aah!

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:37.780
Aah!

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:44.620
Don't touch that!

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:06.709
Well, the operation
seems to be a success...

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:12.615
But the doctor died.

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:16.551
Uh...

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:17.619
Where am I?

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.355
You're in our own
hospital, Michael.

01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:22.390
How long have I been here?

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.925
You've been here 6 weeks.

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:25.860
Your wife is here.

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:27.061
She's in the waiting room.

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.130
Whose brain does she have?

01:24:28.131 --> 01:24:29.864
Whose brain does she have?

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:32.967
Does she talk...

01:24:32.968 --> 01:24:35.771
Or does she go...

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:39.908
No, she talks, Michael.

01:24:41.677 --> 01:24:42.545
No, no, no.

01:24:42.546 --> 01:24:44.312
You've been in bed 6 weeks.

01:24:44.313 --> 01:24:46.047
You don't have the strength.

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:47.949
I'm strong enough.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:49.251
I want to see her.

01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:52.220
Nurse, tell Mrs. Huffer
the doctor's awake.

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:54.989
Hfuhruhurr.

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:56.424
Wait.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:25:00.928
I don't want her
to see me like this.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:04.500
I want to be on my own 2 feet.

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.444
There.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:19.747
Your husband is awake
and can see you.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.284
He's awake?

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.286
What's wrong?

01:25:24.287 --> 01:25:28.823
I never told him
I was a compulsive eater.

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:30.826
I've gained so much weight.

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.432
Michael.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.180
Anne...

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:54.916
Uumellmahaye?

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.352
Yes, Michael.

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:03.326
You're not disappointed
I'm so fat?

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.831
What fat?
