03:07.166 --> 03:09.333
Shut down the Grand Guignol Theater,

03:09.416 --> 03:11.333
close the theater of shame!

03:16.666 --> 03:18.166
Paula Maxa,

03:18.291 --> 03:22.958
the bloody, the immortal Paula...

03:23.791 --> 03:25.333
Are you here to see her?

03:25.458 --> 03:28.041
- Who are you talking about?
- Paula Maxa,

03:28.666 --> 03:30.666
the most assassinated woman in the world.

03:31.583 --> 03:34.250
Come be afraid,

03:34.375 --> 03:36.791
you won't regret it.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.500
The bloody Paula Maxa...

03:39.916 --> 03:40.916
Thank you.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.708
Eugène de Lancry.

03:43.708 --> 03:44.708
Nice to meet you.

03:45.916 --> 03:48.541
You, like me, like them,

03:48.875 --> 03:50.333
you're here for her.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.583
Everything's been put back together.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.750
I don't have a single scar,

04:04.875 --> 04:07.583
yet I've been assassinated
more than 10000 times onstage.

04:11.583 --> 04:14.458
Beaten, martyred,

04:15.541 --> 04:16.916
sliced to bits,

04:17.750 --> 04:21.166
vaporized, shoved in a rolling mill,

04:21.833 --> 04:24.833
crushed, boiled alive,

04:24.958 --> 04:26.333
drained of my blood,

04:26.458 --> 04:28.000
burned with acid,

04:28.125 --> 04:31.000
impaled, deboned,

04:31.458 --> 04:34.458
hung, buried alive,

04:34.958 --> 04:36.666
boiled in a stew,

04:36.791 --> 04:39.333
eviscerated, drawn and quartered,

04:39.916 --> 04:43.791
shot, chopped to pieces, stoned,

04:44.250 --> 04:46.375
lacerated, asphyxiated,

04:46.666 --> 04:51.125
poisoned, burned alive, eaten by a lion,

04:51.250 --> 04:53.333
crucified, scalped,

04:53.458 --> 04:54.791
strangled,

04:54.916 --> 04:58.541
had my throat slit, drowned, pulverized,

04:58.666 --> 05:00.458
stabbed, shot

05:00.583 --> 05:01.666
and raped.

05:07.958 --> 05:11.416
Every part of my body
has been cut up, planed,

05:12.500 --> 05:15.000
trimmed, demolished.

05:20.250 --> 05:23.916
But as you can see, despite all that,

05:25.708 --> 05:27.083
I stand before you now.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.333
I am Paula Maxa.

05:42.958 --> 05:47.833
THE MOST ASSASSINATED WOMAN IN THE WORLD

06:14.458 --> 06:15.750
Open the doors!

06:15.958 --> 06:18.416
- Blood!
- Paula Maxa!

06:18.541 --> 06:20.125
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:22.958 --> 06:25.208
thank you for coming

06:25.541 --> 06:28.708
to the Grand Guignol Theater.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.125
Come in. Come in and sit down.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.708
Go home!

06:35.833 --> 06:38.041
I know you.
You're the Comte de Reinach's son.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.500
Don't go in there young man,
or I'll tell your parents.

06:41.958 --> 06:43.558
Nothing. Don't worry, she must be crazy.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.458
I'll tell your parents! Shame on you!

06:46.083 --> 06:48.500
The scum of the earth is in that theater!

06:49.916 --> 06:51.458
MURDER IN THE MADHOUSE

06:51.583 --> 06:53.958
You're about to see a captivating show.

06:54.666 --> 06:57.291
Like the actors,
we're all occasionally possessed.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.166
Alfred Binet.

06:59.541 --> 07:00.541
Well now,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.375
you know Alfred Binet.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.333
I'm a reporter I did a little research.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.041
A reporter you say?

07:06.375 --> 07:08.541
Are you among those
fighting to close this theater,

07:08.666 --> 07:10.416
who believe all the rumors of murder

07:10.541 --> 07:12.208
and ritual sacrifice?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166
I'm not paid to have an opinion.

07:15.750 --> 07:19.208
You seem different, young man.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.583
May I go ahead of you?

07:23.666 --> 07:25.583
Enjoy the show!

07:37.750 --> 07:39.833
This evening, ladies and gentlemen,

07:39.958 --> 07:42.500
the director of Grand Guignol Theater

07:42.625 --> 07:45.875
presents "Murder in the Madhouse",

07:46.000 --> 07:47.416
by our Prince of Terror,

07:47.541 --> 07:50.458
André de Lorde, and the wise

07:50.583 --> 07:52.208
and no less diabolical

07:52.333 --> 07:54.791
doctor Alfred Binet!

08:01.458 --> 08:05.333
Do you hear the sound
of the night that surrounds us?

08:09.166 --> 08:12.291
This evening,
you're going to experience true horror.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.500
Your bones will tremble,

08:14.625 --> 08:17.333
and the weakest hearts will fail.

08:18.041 --> 08:19.541
But don't worry,

08:19.666 --> 08:23.375
our doctor is here
to revive you if necessary.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.000
Even if lately

08:26.125 --> 08:28.666
he's been the first one to faint.

08:29.541 --> 08:30.541
Wuss!

08:31.250 --> 08:32.332
But...!

08:32.457 --> 08:33.582
What's this?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.916
He passed out already?

08:37.332 --> 08:39.375
But the show hasn't even started.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.000
I can't believe my eyes!

08:47.541 --> 08:49.458
You're all very brave.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.583
The devil be praised, here they are.

08:55.416 --> 08:59.000
Above all,
don't hesitate to use the buckets.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.583
That's what they're there for.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.375
Maxa!

09:26.000 --> 09:27.708
Where am I?

09:32.708 --> 09:34.291
What's happening to me?

09:41.875 --> 09:44.791
Why am I trapped in this dismal place?

09:47.375 --> 09:49.208
What is that noise?

09:50.833 --> 09:52.791
Who's complaining?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.541
Look out, Maxa! Behind you!

10:00.375 --> 10:01.666
Still sniveling?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.666
You better learn fast,

10:04.458 --> 10:06.666
no one can help you here.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.833
But where am I?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.666
In the asylum, honey.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.625
Let me out.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.583
I'm not crazy.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.875
You're quite presumptuous,

10:19.375 --> 10:21.375
everyone's crazy in here!

10:23.583 --> 10:25.125
Who are you?

10:26.458 --> 10:27.875
Don't you recognize me?

10:30.916 --> 10:32.625
I'm the one-eyed woman.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.583
Does my face disgust you?

10:36.625 --> 10:39.333
You're indeed
a very beautiful young woman.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.125
Perhaps the most beautiful
we've ever had here.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.166
Surely, you'll be the doctor's favorite.

10:51.791 --> 10:52.833
The doctor?

10:55.750 --> 10:56.916
What doctor?

10:57.666 --> 10:59.208
Patience,

11:00.250 --> 11:02.458
you'll meet him soon enough.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.541
I'll explain this is a mistake
and he'll help me.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.333
Doctors help people.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.291
I don't have anything to fear.

11:17.416 --> 11:18.875
Of course, sweetheart.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.708
Here, the doctor makes women like you
very happy.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.250
That's what he'll have you believe.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.333
Enough talking.

11:50.791 --> 11:52.333
We have to get her ready.

11:54.791 --> 11:58.458
No! Leave me alone.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.666
I don't belong here.
I want to see my husband.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.916
But your husband brought you here.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.708
He must want to get rid of you.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.000
Believe me, you wouldn't be the first.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.083
Don't move, there's nothing you can do.

12:12.208 --> 12:16.041
If you don't stop fighting,
we'll have to do this the hard way.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.125
There must be a mistake...

12:20.791 --> 12:23.250
No one ends up here by mistake,

12:23.375 --> 12:24.458
believe me.

12:24.583 --> 12:28.958
My own children brought me here.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.125
Damn them!

12:32.083 --> 12:33.708
You're much too beautiful,

12:35.375 --> 12:38.208
let's see if we can fix this pretty face.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.625
Look at us now, if you can.

13:06.291 --> 13:07.333
Jean...

13:09.958 --> 13:11.083
What do you say?

13:21.041 --> 13:22.500
More! More blood!

13:25.833 --> 13:27.291
You're much less beautiful.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.041
You should thank us.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.750
I said, you should thank us.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.750
I said, you should thank us!

13:45.333 --> 13:47.083
Thank you.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.666
She's too ugly now.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.750
The doctor's going to be disappointed.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.791
Good evening, darlings!

13:58.916 --> 14:01.666
Oh sorry doctor,

14:01.791 --> 14:03.708
she wouldn't go along with it.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.458
What have you done! You're jealous.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.833
Help, doctor! Help me!

14:11.708 --> 14:14.041
You really did a number on her.

14:14.916 --> 14:17.375
So be it. Let's finish the job.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.541
I don't need her head without her eye.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.458
We'll need you-know-who.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.166
Oh yes!

14:24.291 --> 14:26.291
No! I'm begging you!

14:26.416 --> 14:28.750
I'm begging you, doctor!

14:30.583 --> 14:32.541
No!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.958
What's happening? I can't see anything.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.458
Don't stop.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.458
She's going to die soon.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.750
Louder!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.375
- The shrinking machine!
- No!

14:56.333 --> 14:58.041
You sure do like theater.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.791
Her head might still be useful, Doctor...

15:23.250 --> 15:24.708
separately, I mean.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.166
Cheeky!

15:39.750 --> 15:41.583
This is a horrible mistake...

15:44.583 --> 15:47.041
Bravo!

16:44.041 --> 16:45.541
This blood is disgusting.

16:45.666 --> 16:48.500
André, you told us you were going
to put more sugar in the blood.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.916
Sugar is expensive these days, princess.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.000
We have to do something about the smell.

16:53.125 --> 16:54.291
It tastes revolting.

16:54.416 --> 16:55.833
It's awful! Taste it.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.625
It's the best blood
in the history of theater.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.333
Go change. You're back on in five minutes.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.500
Where's Paul?

17:04.375 --> 17:06.208
The song was good tonight.

17:06.915 --> 17:08.790
- Have you seen Paul?
- Here I am.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.500
Where did you go?

17:10.625 --> 17:11.500
I was working.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.208
You were daydreaming.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.833
There's not enough pressure.

17:14.958 --> 17:15.958
I told you,

17:16.083 --> 17:17.958
it has to spurt even further.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.958
I want it all over their faces.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.040
The stage needs cleaning.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.000
What about me?

17:24.415 --> 17:25.415
Wait.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.708
Change costumes,

17:27.833 --> 17:29.166
get dressed.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.333
On stage in five minutes.
Curtain in five minutes.

17:32.458 --> 17:33.750
There you go.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.375
Thanks, Paul.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.333
Thanks for the velvet under the table.
It's wonderful.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.833
Go!

17:42.416 --> 17:44.291
- Here.
- Thanks.

17:44.416 --> 17:46.000
Why did you forget your line?

17:46.125 --> 17:47.750
You've done it a hundred times.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.000
You're the one with the problem.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.708
Without Paul,
without me, without the others,

17:52.833 --> 17:54.708
you'd be nothing, you or your theater.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.790
This theater is full every night
thanks to my shows.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.458
They made you a queen!

17:59.583 --> 18:01.416
So show me some respect!

18:06.166 --> 18:07.375
So,

18:07.708 --> 18:11.791
you want more blood,
more hemoglobin, more grit,

18:11.916 --> 18:15.375
it has to bleed, it has to gush,
it has to spurt?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.875
While you're waiting,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.250
we'd like to propose
a light-hearted interlude

18:20.375 --> 18:24.208
with a delicious little sketch
by our friend Georges Courteline:

18:24.333 --> 18:25.791
"Lawn bowling"!

18:48.416 --> 18:49.583
Mr. De Lorde?

18:50.458 --> 18:52.666
- Mr. De Lorde?
- Silence, we're live.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.750
Jean Charpentier, from Le Petit Journal.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.625
Le Petit Journal?

18:57.166 --> 18:58.833
You don't look like a critic.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.041
They tend to be ugly and badly dressed.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.541
- News.
- Okay, I understand.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.541
What do you think
I should write about the fanatics

19:07.666 --> 19:09.250
who want to close this theater?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.166
That they're idiots.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.250
What's your name, beautiful?

19:14.375 --> 19:16.583
My name is Félicie,

19:18.291 --> 19:19.500
and you?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.875
- Holy cow!
- Oh no!

19:22.875 --> 19:26.041
It's an old trick.
They relax to a bit of light comedy

19:26.166 --> 19:28.333
and then we knock them out
with what they came for.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.958
It's called a Scottish shower.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.625
In Saint-Casimir near Amboise,
we had a neighbor...

19:43.250 --> 19:47.083
Look at them laugh.
In ten minutes, they'll be scared stiff.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.125
Many say the theater's days are numbered

19:50.250 --> 19:51.500
because of cinema.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.500
Have you been to the cinema?

19:55.250 --> 19:57.750
I've been to the cinema. So what?

19:57.875 --> 19:59.291
You were in the room.

19:59.416 --> 20:00.708
Did you smell the blood?

20:01.375 --> 20:04.250
We can do things cinema
will never be able to do.

20:04.708 --> 20:07.500
People live out nightmares here.
That's what they want.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.916
They want to feel horror in real life.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.291
They don't want to dream.

20:11.625 --> 20:14.333
We'll still be around
a thousand years from now.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.058
I doubt it, but I hope so for your sake.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.916
Let me remind you that backstage entrance

20:18.041 --> 20:19.791
is prohibited to anyone
outside the troupe.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.041
But the exit is entirely open.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.958
It's this way. I'll show you out.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.875
You're not just a pretty face, are you?

20:29.416 --> 20:31.125
You're a smarty-pants.

21:50.416 --> 21:51.416
Paula!

21:54.500 --> 21:56.416
Paula onstage, please.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.500
Open up!

22:10.666 --> 22:12.208
Let us in!

22:13.458 --> 22:14.458
Sir,

22:14.750 --> 22:16.430
are you aware of the scandalous activities

22:16.454 --> 22:17.833
that go on in this pigsty?

22:17.958 --> 22:19.125
Good evening, Sylviane.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.958
- Good evening.
- What are you referring to?

22:22.083 --> 22:25.416
These madmen who organize
satanic orgies in cemeteries,

22:25.541 --> 22:27.166
at night, with prostitutes.

22:27.291 --> 22:28.500
Big strumpets.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.000
Sylviane, her name is Sylviane,

22:31.125 --> 22:32.165
which doesn't help at all,

22:32.625 --> 22:34.985
is referring to our little jaunts
to the Montmartre Cemetery

22:35.009 --> 22:38.125
where we sometimes take our audience
for VIP evenings.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.833
I think what goes on
in your head is much worse

22:40.958 --> 22:42.291
than what goes on in my theater.

22:42.416 --> 22:44.625
My theater is a cure, not an illness.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Young man, help us.

22:46.041 --> 22:49.458
Sign this petition in favor of closing
this den of debauchery and madness.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.208
Help us save our families,

22:51.333 --> 22:53.500
our city,
our neighborhoods, our country...

22:53.625 --> 22:54.416
France.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.583
I'm sure there are thousands of ways
to save France.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.916
But I don't see how
closing a theater will help.

23:01.708 --> 23:02.833
Go ahead and laugh.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.541
I see the high society

23:04.666 --> 23:06.541
leave your theater covered in blood.

23:06.666 --> 23:08.291
Someday, a horrible tragedy will happen

23:08.416 --> 23:10.500
and you'll be the only one crying.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.583
We're going to have you all arrested,
you know it!

23:14.291 --> 23:15.833
I think they're real heads.

23:18.791 --> 23:21.375
The days of carefree depravity are over.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.083
France is in crisis. No more laughing.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.250
Regardless what you think,
we're the resistance.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.000
Audiences thirsty for blood
who wander at night

23:31.125 --> 23:32.750
to commit actual crimes,

23:33.375 --> 23:34.541
it could happen, couldn't it?

23:35.166 --> 23:36.846
If that was true,
there would be a massacre

23:36.870 --> 23:39.083
every time Macbeth is set
at the Comédie Française.

23:39.208 --> 23:41.083
You're not worried about Paula Maxa?

23:41.875 --> 23:43.958
There are people
who stand outside the theater

23:44.083 --> 23:46.750
just to hear her scream, so...

23:46.875 --> 23:47.958
One more reason.

23:49.666 --> 23:51.125
The interview is over.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.625
Good night Mr. Reporter.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.291
Deliver the boards to the theatre.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.458
Thanks, goodbye.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.500
Are you looking for me, kid?

24:47.625 --> 24:49.333
I'm looking for the exit.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.291
You're looking for Maxa.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.166
She's dead, didn't you see?

24:56.458 --> 24:58.000
End of the hall, darling.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.958
Give her this, will you?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.458
Another admirer.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.916
Christ, that wouldn't happen to me.

25:06.625 --> 25:09.333
Here, here, fresh meat!

25:15.083 --> 25:16.791
I wasn't at my best tonight.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.041
I nearly gouged out Maxa's eye for real.

25:19.166 --> 25:21.416
You got my hand for sure.

25:28.416 --> 25:29.416
Good evening.

25:35.791 --> 25:36.875
This is for you.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.333
Thank you.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.250
They're not from me. An actress

25:41.375 --> 25:43.875
gave them to me on behalf
of one of your admirers.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.083
You can put them in the trash.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.583
You don't like lilacs?

25:50.708 --> 25:52.125
I don't like unsolicited gifts.

25:56.875 --> 25:57.875
What do you want?

25:58.458 --> 26:00.833
I'm Jean Charpentier,
from Le Petit Journal.

26:01.416 --> 26:02.750
You don't look like a reporter.

26:03.583 --> 26:05.166
I'll take that as a compliment.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.083
I'm writing an article on...

26:07.208 --> 26:09.916
Terror at Grand Guignol.

26:10.291 --> 26:11.291
Screams,

26:13.041 --> 26:14.250
deaths,

26:15.291 --> 26:18.625
killers wandering the streets of Paris?

26:18.750 --> 26:23.125
All these poor innocent people
disturbed by Grand Guignol's show.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.666
- Something like that?
- Yes, actually.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.916
- May I sit?
- No...

26:29.041 --> 26:30.041
Shit!

26:33.333 --> 26:34.458
Thank you.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.708
Welcome to Grand Guignol,
where everything is fake.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.916
I'm going to sit over here.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.363
Not there either. That's my bed.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.333
I'll stand then.

26:50.416 --> 26:53.541
Everyone in the audience,

26:54.041 --> 26:55.833
what are they looking for?

26:56.583 --> 26:57.958
It's fascinating.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.416
Alfred Binet said that fear is to the mind

27:00.541 --> 27:02.041
what pain is to the body.

27:02.708 --> 27:06.208
Some people like to suffer,
others like to be scared.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.166
And you?

27:09.666 --> 27:10.791
I like both.

27:10.916 --> 27:12.583
No, I mean why do you do it?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.916
Why does an actress act?
That's quite a question.

27:17.833 --> 27:20.666
Do you like being
tortured night after night?

27:22.166 --> 27:24.458
I usually prefer to get dressed alone.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.416
Excuse me.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.000
You and your readers
are going to be disappointed.

27:38.625 --> 27:39.791
Why?

27:41.791 --> 27:43.333
There are no monsters here.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.625
Positions for the Naked Man! Paula Maxa...

27:50.958 --> 27:51.958
Positions.

27:53.541 --> 27:54.708
Is something wrong?

27:55.416 --> 27:57.500
You're not at all
the woman I imagined you'd be.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.333
Too happy for a victim?

28:00.250 --> 28:02.750
I do drama like others do business.

28:03.791 --> 28:05.511
If you'd like
to continue this conversation,

28:05.535 --> 28:08.250
I'm sure a good reporter like you

28:08.375 --> 28:11.291
knows how to find me after the show.

28:32.958 --> 28:34.666
Marie Thérèse and Jean 1913.

28:48.458 --> 28:51.458
I love watching you die, again and again.
Soon I'll kill you.

29:19.208 --> 29:23.583
THE DEAD RAT BAR

30:28.875 --> 30:30.333
Shall we swim, Jean?

30:32.041 --> 30:33.750
Come on, let's swim!

31:30.958 --> 31:33.583
I'll call the commissioner tomorrow.
Exactly.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.250
Thank you.

31:38.666 --> 31:40.166
Give me that.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.166
That one... No.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.333
The boss is looking for you.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.375
You should see a doctor.

32:07.333 --> 32:10.291
Jean? In the boss's office, please.

32:10.416 --> 32:11.416
Yes.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.625
EDITOR IN CHIEF

32:24.934 --> 32:25.934
Mr. Dupuis.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.083
Jean, my boy...

32:27.958 --> 32:30.083
How's our story coming?

32:31.333 --> 32:32.541
I'm working on it.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.333
Do you need anything from me?

32:37.250 --> 32:38.333
Like what?

32:39.916 --> 32:42.000
A kick in the ass, for example?

32:42.833 --> 32:44.208
You were right,

32:44.333 --> 32:47.875
I think we're on to something
with the Grand Guignol Theater.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.833
It's a fascinating place,
full of bizarre people,

32:50.958 --> 32:52.000
enigmatic, even.

32:52.666 --> 32:56.041
Jean my boy, I'm not paying you
to be the next Proust.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.916
I sent you
because I'm convinced this theater

32:59.041 --> 33:02.083
is where the city's potential killers
hang out.

33:03.375 --> 33:05.208
That's what our readers are waiting for

33:05.333 --> 33:06.853
and you need to get used to this idea.

33:06.978 --> 33:08.898
That's what I mean.
I'm interested in the people.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.750
No one cares about the people.

33:11.750 --> 33:12.875
What is this theater?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.750
Maniacs playing maniacs
who kill maniacs, in front of maniacs!

33:15.875 --> 33:18.500
So Jean, my boy, find me a connection

33:18.625 --> 33:20.958
and write me an article along those lines.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.625
Use your imagination!

33:25.208 --> 33:28.166
"The theater of horror
in the heart of horror!"

33:28.291 --> 33:31.750
That's a front page.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.625
Where am I?

33:38.291 --> 33:39.916
What's happening to me?

33:45.291 --> 33:48.666
Why am I trapped in this dismal place?

33:50.458 --> 33:52.125
What's that noise?

33:53.083 --> 33:55.666
Who's complaining?

34:01.916 --> 34:05.833
Paula Maxa is lying on stage,

34:08.375 --> 34:10.208
the door opens,

34:12.083 --> 34:14.291
and a vile shrew appears.

34:15.416 --> 34:16.916
She's ugly!

34:18.208 --> 34:19.875
Her face

34:20.041 --> 34:22.750
completely burned,

34:23.875 --> 34:27.291
from when she was held down
on a woodstove...

34:32.291 --> 34:35.291
Paula: "Where am I?"

34:36.416 --> 34:37.500
The shrew:

34:38.666 --> 34:42.416
"You're in the asylum, darling."

35:06.291 --> 35:08.666
Hey, it's our little reporter!

35:09.375 --> 35:11.833
Sorry, but you're not at all her type.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.250
I'm not sure she's mine. Good evening.

35:15.916 --> 35:17.541
Don't look at me like that.

35:20.375 --> 35:21.666
- Hello.
- Hello.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.708
- Shall we dance?
- No.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.041
My name is Julie,

35:26.375 --> 35:27.791
- remember me?
- Yes.

35:29.041 --> 35:31.291
- The crazy one.
- I remember very well.

35:31.416 --> 35:33.625
Want to buy me a drink
while I tell you my life story?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.916
No thank you.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.083
This is for you.

35:37.583 --> 35:38.583
I didn't order anything.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.041
The lady over there did.

35:41.875 --> 35:44.291
It's a Poison... The cocktail.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.083
Shall we dance?

35:47.208 --> 35:48.708
Maybe later.

35:49.541 --> 35:50.708
Be careful, kid.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.583
She shoots them all down.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.416
All of them.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.416
Even André.

35:59.333 --> 36:00.583
Especially André.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.500
Men have hung themselves for her.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.208
I feel sorry for them.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.458
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.625
- Thanks for the drink.
- Hello.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.958
You're not that hard to find after all.

36:19.291 --> 36:21.083
The invitation was for yesterday.

36:22.291 --> 36:24.666
Did you at least
watch the show again tonight?

36:24.791 --> 36:25.791
No.

36:26.875 --> 36:30.833
Paula Maxa isn't so interesting after all?

36:35.125 --> 36:36.791
Oh! Quiet!

36:37.041 --> 36:39.625
- To answer your question...
- What question?

36:41.458 --> 36:43.500
Dying onstage keeps me alive.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.458
I'm not sure I understand.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.208
I love theater, don't you?

36:52.333 --> 36:54.791
Yes, though I admit I prefer the shows

36:54.916 --> 36:56.833
on the Grands Boulevards.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.000
Really?

36:58.250 --> 37:01.125
Can you imagine me in an evening gown,

37:01.250 --> 37:03.833
playing a rich lady
betrayed by her husband?

37:04.875 --> 37:08.416
Or who falls in love
with a young actor in a nice suit?

37:08.541 --> 37:09.541
No, thank you.

37:09.583 --> 37:12.250
Who wants to be murdered every evening?

37:14.541 --> 37:18.000
Frightening people is as interesting
as making them laugh or cry.

37:18.416 --> 37:19.416
Sure,

37:19.583 --> 37:23.958
except the neighborhood is turning
into an open-air Grand Guignol.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.791
Killing Paula Maxa
would be quite the trophy for a killer,

37:29.583 --> 37:30.791
don't you think?

37:31.708 --> 37:32.875
So...

37:34.041 --> 37:35.666
You think I should quit?

37:36.458 --> 37:37.583
I don't know.

37:37.958 --> 37:41.041
You could do cinema, for example.

37:44.041 --> 37:47.166
Tomorrow they're showing a color film,
with blood.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.125
We could go together.

37:50.416 --> 37:51.625
For your article?

37:52.416 --> 37:53.708
Absolutely.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.041
Maybe.

38:51.791 --> 38:53.500
LILLY THE TIGRESS

42:00.041 --> 42:01.583
The world is going mad, André.

42:02.416 --> 42:03.875
You should be happy.

42:06.041 --> 42:08.541
Playing with Paula's mental health...

42:09.000 --> 42:10.291
That's going too far.

42:12.250 --> 42:14.208
I want to go as far as possible.

42:14.708 --> 42:18.166
Music, sound effects, lights, script...

42:18.333 --> 42:21.291
It has to put her into a trance.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.708
Can't you see that what we're doing here

42:24.833 --> 42:27.250
goes against the ethics of my profession?

42:27.458 --> 42:28.458
Which one?

42:28.541 --> 42:31.166
Psychiatrist or successful author?

42:31.291 --> 42:33.458
Stop taking everything lightly.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.458
I don't understand why
you're so set on taking such a risk.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.000
What risk?

42:38.416 --> 42:41.083
I want to push the limits
of the live show.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.000
People want blood,

42:43.125 --> 42:46.500
sperm and sweat.
And I'm here to give it to them.

42:47.083 --> 42:49.458
You just don't want her to leave.

42:49.583 --> 42:50.750
So what?

42:50.916 --> 42:54.333
You're the only one who knows
how her mind works.

42:55.458 --> 42:57.625
I need you in order to control her.

42:57.958 --> 43:01.625
You're taking a big risk
in making her relive this trauma.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.875
It could even kill her.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.333
So be it!

43:16.291 --> 43:19.541
LE BOURDONNEC BUTCHER

44:39.500 --> 44:40.750
Marie-Thérèse?

44:43.750 --> 44:45.000
Marie-Thérèse?

44:46.208 --> 44:48.541
Remember when we walked along the water?

44:50.166 --> 44:52.958
Mother made you sing a lament,

44:55.333 --> 44:57.166
she said you had a nice voice.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.333
Why did you abandon me, Paula?

45:04.291 --> 45:05.291
Why?

45:07.666 --> 45:09.583
I didn't abandon you Aimée.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.041
What are you looking at?

45:14.541 --> 45:15.750
Who's there?

45:17.583 --> 45:18.583
Paula?

45:19.875 --> 45:20.916
Paul?

45:23.916 --> 45:25.500
Why is there so much blood?

45:26.500 --> 45:28.708
People come here to see blood.

45:28.833 --> 45:31.416
They like to see its color, to smell it.

45:31.750 --> 45:34.000
They like to see
it trickle down your skin.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.500
You're going to drive me crazy!

45:35.625 --> 45:38.791
You don't need anyone
to make you a madwoman!

45:39.541 --> 45:41.416
That's why you're the best.

45:42.791 --> 45:44.708
Rehearsal starts in ten minutes!

46:12.333 --> 46:13.833
Marie-Thérèse!

46:14.416 --> 46:15.791
Marie-Thérèse!

46:20.791 --> 46:23.833
No!

46:29.791 --> 46:31.250
That hurts!

46:32.041 --> 46:33.458
I'm disappointed.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.791
I thought you were tougher.

46:36.750 --> 46:38.208
Do you have to push that hard?

46:38.333 --> 46:40.625
I asked him to. It has to look real.

46:44.125 --> 46:47.500
- Give it to me.
- Don't leave your props lying around.

46:47.625 --> 46:48.625
Come here.

46:49.833 --> 46:51.708
That's exactly what I'm after.

46:53.166 --> 46:54.416
Understand?

46:54.541 --> 46:58.375
Yes, grab her, hit her and make her bleed.

47:00.208 --> 47:02.500
- I understand.
- Pay attention to the rhythm.

47:02.625 --> 47:04.875
The audience has to stay focused on her.

47:05.291 --> 47:06.916
Yes, I understand.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.000
Don't worry,

47:26.208 --> 47:28.958
we have to rehearse a little more,
but it'll be fine.

47:44.833 --> 47:46.333
Do you see her?

47:47.083 --> 47:48.333
Do you see Aimée?

47:48.916 --> 47:49.958
Yes.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.958
You're lucky to see people you love.

48:00.291 --> 48:01.375
I see you.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.541
I need you, Paul.

48:08.125 --> 48:09.125
I want...

48:11.666 --> 48:14.166
to make a change after this show.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.833
I've killed you thousands of time,

48:19.416 --> 48:21.000
you can trust me.

48:28.833 --> 48:31.625
- Have you seen Paula?
- What do you want with her?

48:32.083 --> 48:34.250
You want to see an article
on Corsicans in Pigalle?

48:34.750 --> 48:37.625
She's off tonight,
but she'll come for the show.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.291
Thank you.

48:48.208 --> 48:49.666
You could try knocking.

48:50.083 --> 48:51.500
This theater belongs to me.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.208
I need to trust you and Paul,

48:53.333 --> 48:54.708
but you don't seem focused.

48:55.166 --> 48:57.625
Don't worry, I think I'll manage.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.583
- It's my life after all.
- It's your life

49:00.708 --> 49:02.333
and I'm going to make it a success.

49:02.791 --> 49:04.291
We've had more success

49:04.416 --> 49:06.666
since those murders made the headlines.

49:07.541 --> 49:08.541
Doesn't that worry you?

49:08.958 --> 49:12.208
That reporter said that.
What does he want?

49:12.333 --> 49:13.541
Nothing.

49:14.041 --> 49:15.333
He's only interested in movies.

49:15.833 --> 49:18.416
My God, what bad taste!

49:20.291 --> 49:22.531
Give him what he wants
and he'll give us cheap publicity.

49:23.041 --> 49:24.083
We need it.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.291
That madwoman Sylviane has connections.

49:26.416 --> 49:27.416
We need our own.

49:28.166 --> 49:31.166
Then we'll go back to normal, you and I.

49:31.666 --> 49:33.041
How much do I get?

49:33.416 --> 49:34.958
I'll take that as a yes.

49:36.791 --> 49:38.250
Come in.

49:39.166 --> 49:42.416
I have your new dress.
It came this morning.

49:42.541 --> 49:43.958
Put it over there.

49:50.083 --> 49:51.625
Can I keep the ribbon?

49:51.750 --> 49:53.041
Of course.

49:53.875 --> 49:55.166
Thank you.

50:13.666 --> 50:16.208
That's the end. I'll kill you.
One last time! J.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.500
How are you Doumé?

50:39.041 --> 50:40.541
Order whatever you like.

50:41.875 --> 50:43.208
Two cognacs, please.

50:44.125 --> 50:45.500
André wants my hide.

50:47.083 --> 50:48.166
Jealous?

50:48.291 --> 50:49.583
More than you know.

50:50.083 --> 50:51.125
Of me?

50:53.208 --> 50:54.500
Don't be cocky.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.083
Thank you.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.750
What's going on?

51:03.083 --> 51:05.125
I don't like jealous people.

51:29.208 --> 51:30.375
Alright,

51:33.041 --> 51:34.958
tonight, we're going to the movies.

51:35.375 --> 51:36.708
Alright.

51:37.166 --> 51:39.125
I really need to sleep.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.208
You got what you wanted.

52:10.958 --> 52:12.208
It's time to leave.

52:13.416 --> 52:14.708
Her scream is unique.

52:15.208 --> 52:17.583
One of the most beautiful
in the history of theater.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.708
She owes us, you know.

52:21.916 --> 52:23.375
Business is business.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.000
I give you the corpses,

52:25.375 --> 52:28.708
and you give me that.

52:29.875 --> 52:32.666
You know what, I don't like that.

52:34.125 --> 52:35.375
What do you mean?

52:36.416 --> 52:37.958
I want her,

52:39.500 --> 52:41.041
I want Paula.

52:47.250 --> 52:48.875
We'll talk about it later.

52:58.916 --> 53:00.500
Hurry, the movie's started.

53:00.625 --> 53:02.166
Wait, give me a second.

53:03.541 --> 53:05.166
It's no Grand Guignol.

53:53.583 --> 53:55.708
Did you see that? It's Paula Maxa.

54:18.166 --> 54:20.250
You know who I am, don't you?

54:20.666 --> 54:25.500
You have a dark heart. Leave!
Leave me here!

54:26.291 --> 54:28.583
I came for what is mine.

54:28.708 --> 54:30.166
God will protect me.

55:48.625 --> 55:49.958
What do you want?

55:50.083 --> 55:51.666
I want what's mine.

55:52.041 --> 55:53.333
I want to live again.

55:53.791 --> 55:55.125
I want your heart.

55:55.250 --> 55:56.250
Please!

56:11.166 --> 56:12.375
You shall die

56:13.500 --> 56:14.833
and I shall live!

56:43.125 --> 56:45.291
Wouldn't Hollywood be a dream?

56:45.833 --> 56:49.541
You wouldn't have to do
the same thing everyday.

56:49.666 --> 56:53.791
You'd be surrounded by assistants,
make-up artists, hairdressers...

56:53.916 --> 56:55.416
You'd have a driver...

56:55.791 --> 56:59.750
you'd live on the beach
and wake up to the Pacific Ocean.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.020
I don't know if you're a good reporter

57:02.044 --> 57:03.500
but you're a good salesman.

57:03.625 --> 57:04.791
I'm being honest.

57:04.916 --> 57:07.916
- I've always dreamed...
- Why do you make things hard?

57:08.333 --> 57:11.250
You can't just try
to sleep with me like the others?

57:11.916 --> 57:14.958
"Slept with Paula Maxa."
That would look good on your list.

57:15.333 --> 57:16.458
You'd tell everyone

57:16.583 --> 57:20.166
how you made the Queen of Terror
scream with pleasure.

57:20.291 --> 57:22.416
Your colleagues would be jealous

57:22.875 --> 57:24.235
and it would be good for your ego.

57:24.291 --> 57:27.875
They'd toast to Jean,
the best lay in Paris.

57:28.476 --> 57:29.796
After what I've just been though,

57:29.820 --> 57:31.903
that's not exactly what I want.

57:47.166 --> 57:48.333
It's perfect.

57:48.625 --> 57:51.583
Your blood is getting better and better.

57:52.208 --> 57:53.916
Nothing beats experimentation.

57:58.583 --> 58:00.416
What are you doing with handcuffs?

58:01.250 --> 58:02.250
Nothing.

58:03.750 --> 58:04.875
Nothing at all.

58:07.291 --> 58:08.291
What is it?

58:10.791 --> 58:12.833
I'm proud of what you do for this theater.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.333
The finale has to be a success.

58:16.041 --> 58:18.208
You're the only one who can do it.

58:18.458 --> 58:19.583
It's easy.

58:20.375 --> 58:22.416
It's like bleeding a pig, as you say.

58:23.291 --> 58:24.958
It will be my masterpiece.

58:26.958 --> 58:29.125
Paula's going to leave us, I can feel it.

58:30.541 --> 58:32.958
Trust me, she'll try her luck elsewhere.

58:33.083 --> 58:35.125
- You think so?
- You're so naive.

58:36.083 --> 58:37.833
She doesn't care about us.

58:39.833 --> 58:42.291
In any case, she can't leave.

58:49.208 --> 58:51.250
I'm going to put this in the cold room.

58:58.166 --> 58:59.916
I told him to put it away.

59:30.791 --> 59:33.208
I had an affair with a married woman.

59:33.333 --> 59:34.833
Aggressive creature.

59:34.958 --> 59:36.416
She's married to a dangerous man.

59:36.958 --> 59:38.166
He surprised us.

59:38.291 --> 59:40.250
- In bed?
- In the bathtub.

59:40.833 --> 59:42.083
In the bathtub?

59:42.208 --> 59:44.000
- He shot you in the bath?
- No,

59:44.583 --> 59:46.833
in the woods the next day at dawn.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.166
You had a duel?

59:48.500 --> 59:50.083
He shot first.

59:53.041 --> 59:54.541
You're as crazy as I am.

59:55.791 --> 59:58.250
I could have killed him, but I didn't.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.541
I think he hates me even more now.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And her?

01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:08.833
Do you love her?

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.416
Yes.

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:16.708
And you, Marie-Thérèse?

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.541
What's this story you've been hiding?

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:23.125
You'll like this.

01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:03.708
My sister fled my parents' house.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.708
Fled what?

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.541
My parents.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:14.208
She wanted to do theater,
maybe even act in movies.

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:17.375
My father hated that.

01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:21.250
We met in secret.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:26.541
A friend of my parents
started courting me at the time.

01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:31.458
His name was Jean, like yours.

01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:34.125
He had a limp.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:37.583
He'd had polio as a child.

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:42.041
One day, he offered to take Aimée and me

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:45.125
to the seaside in his new car.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.666
He lost it in the dunes.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.500
He wanted to rape me.

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.541
I fought back,

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.541
so he beat me until I lost consciousness.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:11.708
He turned on Aimée.

01:02:16.291 --> 01:02:17.916
He raped her too,

01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:23.208
then he left her there,

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:25.583
in agony,

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:29.416
her throat slit

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.958
like an animal.

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:47.416
I couldn't do anything to save her.

01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:51.541
What could you have done?

01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:55.125
Scream...

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:09.125
He committed suicide just before
the police came to arrest him.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.833
But sometimes I...

01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:19.958
hear the metallic click of his shoes.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.875
It's an awful sound.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:36.708
You know, I'm afraid too.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:43.833
I like kissing lips that are afraid.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.416
I SEE YOU

01:05:25.791 --> 01:05:29.916
LE BOURDONNEC BUTCHER

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:35.458
Help me, please!

01:06:35.936 --> 01:06:36.976
Find me everything you can

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
on Marie-Thérèse Beau
and her sister Aimée Beau,

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.458
who should be dead.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:42.000
What's going on?

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.625
Just do what I say. It's important.

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:20.166
The blood isn't flowing in time.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.541
I'm working on it, Paula.

01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:26.041
- It's important.
- I know.

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:31.208
Paul, you're the best.

01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:34.625
But if you aren't able to do it,
all is lost.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.375
I'm aware, Paula.

01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:39.750
I'm aware...

01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:03.208
Violette, you know the rules.

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:05.013
I don't take girls
who work for cigarettes.

01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:09.750
Come on Doumé,
it's raining and I have a date.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.916
I'll take care of you next time.

01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:15.421
If you want to work for us,
you have to tell me.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.500
I was told to wait here.

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:24.832
You have ten minutes
to take him to your place or his.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:43.000
Are you my date?

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:46.791
If you answer to the name Violette,

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.832
then you're my date.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.666
That's me.

01:08:58.582 --> 01:09:00.832
You can buy me a drink while we wait.

01:09:06.457 --> 01:09:07.457
You're a butcher.

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:09.916
Excuse me?

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.354
I'm never wrong about a set of hands.

01:09:12.457 --> 01:09:14.207
I've seen quite a few!

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:17.791
You're wrong. I'm a doctor.

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:19.207
Really?

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:22.125
That's surprising. I'm never wrong.

01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:28.582
What did you do to these hands?

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.250
Nothing.

01:09:33.541 --> 01:09:34.541
I like your hands.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.541
They belong to a real man.

01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:45.625
I like your eyes.

01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:47.791
They remind me of someone.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.000
Do you like candy?

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.041
You're weird.

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.833
I see you like weird.

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:18.458
Violette!

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:43.833
I'm coming down.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.041
Short reckonings make long friends.

01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:44.750
That's not nice.

01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:27.166
I got that information
on Marie-Thérèse Beau.

01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:28.708
Born in Paris...

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:32.791
I think you're aware she's known
by her stage name, Paula Maxa.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.291
Twenty years ago,

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:38.791
her sister Aimée had her throat cut
by one Jean De Lancry.

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:51.000
Your knife is perfect.

01:12:51.958 --> 01:12:53.875
I want to go on stage with it.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.125
This one really looks like Paula.

01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:01.916
Candy?

01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:05.000
They're violet flavored.

01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:13.458
She's yours now.

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:16.328
I don't want to know
what you're going to do with her.

01:13:35.166 --> 01:13:39.291
Alexandre, I've been going over
the theater's accounts with the boss,

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:40.875
can we talk about them?

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:42.333
Yes.

01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.166
I have a date.

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:18.291
You, like me, like them,

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:19.916
are here for her.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.583
Good evening.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:28.166
Paula Maxa, the most assassinated woman
in the world.

01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:32.750
Eugène de Lancry.

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:34.416
Nice to meet you.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:39.833
A TRUE HORROR STORY

01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:15.583
At last! My article.

01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:18.166
Even better. I promised you
the front page and you got it.

01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:20.791
"The queen of terror
at the heart of terror.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:23.833
"Paula Maxa, the most assassinated woman
in the world." Wonderful!

01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:26.678
I know who the Montmartre killer is,
but you're going to have to pay.

01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:29.483
I asked you for two tickets
to Los Angeles and three months' salary.

01:15:29.507 --> 01:15:30.541
Two tickets?

01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:31.958
She really wanted you,

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:33.583
you little bugger.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.458
And I thought you were incompetent.

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.250
Has the lady agreed
to have you write her story?

01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:40.166
No, but we both need to get out of here.

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:42.791
Your tickets and money
are waiting in accounting.

01:15:42.916 --> 01:15:44.416
- Thank you.
- Jean...

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:46.791
Paula Maxa is everywhere.

01:15:46.916 --> 01:15:49.166
Check out today's front page.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:51.166
Nice headline, isn't it?

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.583
TONIGHT PAULA MAXA PLAYS FOR HER LIFE

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:59.166
Grand Guignol Theater,
Chaptal Alley, please.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.125
I have the press list.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.541
They're all here.

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:11.833
Let me see.

01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:14.541
For once,
I'll have them eating from my hand.

01:17:14.666 --> 01:17:17.125
Reporters, the audience, money!

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:19.583
Where's that reporter going?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.083
I've come for Paula. She's in danger here.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.000
You're all responsible.

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:26.583
You think you can take her from us?
Dream on.

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.583
Paula belongs to this theater,
to this troupe, to me.

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:31.833
Take it easy!

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.208
Let me go!

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.750
Come on.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:38.750
Move.

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:41.083
Scram.

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.750
Don't ever come back.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:46.583
André might ask me to kill you next time.

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.500
Paula wants to leave. You can't stop her.

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.291
What are you talking about?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.583
You don't know anything about her.

01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:56.000
I know everything, you poor fool.

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:59.958
Get out of here
before I kill you with my own two hands.

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:12.208
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:14.625
I won't miss.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:15.958
Julie?

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:17.375
I'll be right there.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.125
Did you see that reporter, Jean?

01:19:19.458 --> 01:19:20.541
No.

01:19:21.416 --> 01:19:24.625
He got what he wanted for his article.
You won't see him again.

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.833
Men are like that, Paula.

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:34.125
Down with prostitution!

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.875
These are Grand Guignol's last days!

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.375
Visitors to the theater of the strange,

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.291
the bizarre and the horrible!

01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:44.291
Welcome,

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:47.666
to the Comédie Française of Montmartre!

01:19:53.625 --> 01:19:57.125
Are you ready
for the greatest show of terror

01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.875
the world has ever known?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.125
Then come in, ladies and gents!

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:02.250
Come in!

01:20:03.083 --> 01:20:04.083
Paul?

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:12.541
Come in. Everything is ready.

01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:26.750
I have a few things to adjust.

01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:29.791
Did you bring the product I gave you?

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.458
I've got stage fright.

01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:48.333
Thank you, Paul.

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:16.083
Maxa!

01:21:39.041 --> 01:21:40.625
This is a nice knife.

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:46.416
Yes, very.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.666
It's full.

01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:04.000
Like every night!

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:07.291
But press your ear

01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:09.000
to the theater wall

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:11.541
if you want to hear her scream!

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:21.583
Maxa!

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.416
Curtain!

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.958
You're not swimming?

01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:58.833
I don't feel like it.

01:23:02.416 --> 01:23:03.833
Would you like some wine?

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:06.166
Yes, please.

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.875
Do you remember, Marie-Thérèse?
When we were kids,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.250
everyone listened to us sing at Christmas.

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:26.375
I remember.

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.958
Mother said I had a pretty voice.

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:32.375
You have so many things to discover,
Aimée.

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:35.208
You're not too tired from driving, Jean?

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.083
No.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:37.291
Do you need anything?

01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:40.625
It's nice out, it's a lovely day.

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:45.541
What a good idea to take us
to the seaside in your new car.

01:23:46.083 --> 01:23:48.583
I talked about it enough, didn't I?

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.416
I always keep my promises.

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.916
My brother built this car

01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:57.375
just for me.

01:23:59.166 --> 01:24:00.541
That was nice of him.

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:03.833
Young lady...

01:24:04.666 --> 01:24:06.583
Let's take a walk on the beach.

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:10.583
Why not?

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:18.333
I'm going to enjoy the sun.

01:24:54.916 --> 01:24:56.166
Where is Jean?

01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:00.458
Look out behind you!

01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:03.208
Jean?

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:06.416
Jean, what's wrong with you?

01:25:06.541 --> 01:25:08.291
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.125
Stop, Jean!

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:15.708
Such beautiful hair...

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.375
Smells like sun.

01:25:18.916 --> 01:25:20.208
Help!

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.041
Jean!

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:30.000
Run, Marie-Thérèse!

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.041
Run! Go get help!

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.416
There he is!

01:26:06.541 --> 01:26:08.083
Run, Maxa!

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:12.583
Help me! No!

01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:14.833
Help me!

01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:16.833
Look out!

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:18.500
Jean, no!

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.500
Jean, no!

01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:27.916
He's going to kill you!

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:31.375
Please.

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:55.458
Why, Jean?

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.333
Why?

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:11.083
Please!

01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:15.083
Marie-Thérèse, help me!

01:27:23.083 --> 01:27:24.083
Not that.

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.333
As promised, Marie-Thérèse.

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.291
Bravo!

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.208
Curtain!

01:29:00.916 --> 01:29:02.250
Wonderful. I really believed it.

01:29:02.666 --> 01:29:03.666
Incredible.

01:29:05.291 --> 01:29:06.491
I told you she was incredible.

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:07.848
Really looks like real blood.

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:16.666
It is real blood!

01:29:19.934 --> 01:29:20.934
It's real blood!

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:22.500
What's going on?

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:30.333
Get the paramedics, please.

01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:34.791
Call an ambulance!

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:40.500
What happened?

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.833
It's a real blade.

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:45.833
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.541
Don't look at me, I'm not a doctor.

01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:51.375
Let me through.

01:29:55.208 --> 01:29:57.708
Help me get her to my laboratory.

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.333
Have the police been called?

01:30:35.791 --> 01:30:36.791
She's dead.

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:40.166
This is your fault Paul!
You're responsible for this.

01:30:40.416 --> 01:30:42.125
Calm down. Now is not the time.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:43.250
Alfred...

01:30:47.416 --> 01:30:49.041
Get the paramedics.

01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:51.916
I checked the knife myself.
I don't understand.

01:30:52.041 --> 01:30:54.458
You're a doctor.
Sign the death certificate.

01:30:54.833 --> 01:30:56.500
The police might request an autopsy.

01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:58.791
It's an accident. A horrible accident.

01:31:00.041 --> 01:31:01.708
I told you it would end badly.

01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:02.833
And it did.

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:05.000
It was a masterpiece.

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:06.833
This way.

01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:13.958
Hurry up, boys.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:20.750
There.

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:50.708
What do we tell the press?

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:53.083
That she's a magnificent dead.

01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:56.375
It was me, officers.

01:32:09.208 --> 01:32:10.291
Come on, move it.

01:32:30.875 --> 01:32:35.333
PUBLIC NOTICE
GRAND GUIGNOL IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:39.166
GRAND GUIGNOL THEATER

01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:07.083
NEVER BEFORE SEEN AT THE GRAND GUIGNOL

01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:12.416
Everything's been put back together.

01:33:12.541 --> 01:33:13.375
I have no scars,

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.666
yet I've been assassinated
more than 10000 times onstage.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:18.541
But as you can see,

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:22.375
despite all that, I stand before you now.

01:33:23.666 --> 01:33:25.250
My name is Paula Maxa.

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:28.416
I'm the most assassinated woman
in the world.

01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:30.916
My real name is Marie-Thérèse Beau,

01:33:31.375 --> 01:33:33.166
and I'm not dead yet.

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.666
Paula, are you coming?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.583
Hurry, the plane's going to leave
and everyone is looking for me.

01:33:58.791 --> 01:33:59.791
Are you coming, Jean?

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.333
Are you my date?

01:34:36.875 --> 01:34:38.458
My name is Violette.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.500
Here lies Marie-Thérèse Beau,
known as Paula Maxa.

01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:49.583
"She won't die anymore."

01:34:50.041 --> 01:34:51.583
You're weird.

01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:54.916
I see you like weird.

01:34:55.416 --> 01:34:57.708
Grand Guignol actress Paula Maxa,
born Marie-Thérèse Beau,

01:34:57.833 --> 01:35:01.000
died once on September 23, 1970.
She ended her career at Grand Guignol.

01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:03.875
With no family or friends,
she was buried in a public grave.

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:08.333
Paul Ratineau was one of Paris'
best special effects artists

01:35:08.458 --> 01:35:11.375
and ended his career at Grand Guignol.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:14.416
His fake blood is still used in theaters.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:18.875
I miss you Paula.

01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:21.041
I miss you,

01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:25.458
my life is meaningless
now that you're dead.

01:35:40.916 --> 01:35:41.958
Paula.

01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:46.875
Paula. Is that you?

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.833
No, sir, you must be mistaken,

01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:53.500
but we could work something out.

01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:55.125
No.

01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:59.333
Too bad. I would have liked that.

01:36:42.125 --> 01:36:45.458
