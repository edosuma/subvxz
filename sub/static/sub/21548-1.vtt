09:47.543 --> 09:49.371
Let's go.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.025
Time to go home.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.592
[Tank barking]

09:53.375 --> 09:54.376
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.030
I think this guy belongs to you.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.640
What are you doing over there?

09:57.684 --> 10:00.687
Get in here, you. Get in.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.819
Either trying to play with,
or rearrange my book.

10:02.863 --> 10:03.907
I don't know,
it's really hard to say.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.256
Oh, well, I always said

10:05.300 --> 10:07.128
he'd make a great editor.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.131
- No?
- No. Cute, but no.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.742
Hey, uh, one other quick thing
if you have a second.

10:12.786 --> 10:15.179
Yeah, of course,
come on in. Come on in.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.485
Come on, buddy, inside!

10:16.528 --> 10:17.965
'Come on.'

10:20.707 --> 10:23.100
So, I just wanted to ask

10:23.144 --> 10:27.627
or, uh, maybe suggest
we set some ground rules?

10:28.497 --> 10:30.542
Yeah.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.370
About what?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.329
Well, the dog, for starters.

10:34.372 --> 10:37.680
- Oh, you're not a dog person.
- No, I love dogs.

10:37.724 --> 10:41.336
I mean, I like them,
my daughter loves them.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.208
My ex-husband keeps
promising to get them one

10:44.252 --> 10:46.950
'but I'm just too busy
to commit to a dog right now.'

10:46.994 --> 10:48.822
'I mean, it just wouldn't be
fair to the little guy.'

10:48.865 --> 10:51.781
Especially considering
I have this book deadline

10:51.825 --> 10:54.001
and I'm not quite sure
how I'm gonna hit it.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.090
Oh, you're a writer.
What do you write?

10:56.133 --> 10:59.267
Like, uh, novels or plays?

11:00.355 --> 11:02.009
Teen fiction.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.053
Huh.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.622
It's a lot harder
than it sounds.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.798
Which is why I can't risk
any distractions right now.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.670
So, I was hoping
you could keep Tank

11:10.713 --> 11:12.628
on your side
of the fence, so to speak.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.630
[laughs]
No can do.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.718
What?

11:15.762 --> 11:17.807
There is no fence.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.156
It's a shared patio.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.856
[chuckles]
But...you know what I mean.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.814
Also, I don't know
if you realize

11:24.858 --> 11:26.381
but the walls are,
like, paper thin.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.863
So, if you could keep
the music down past, say--

11:29.906 --> 11:32.604
Look, Jenna, I really appreciate
you bringing Tank back

11:32.648 --> 11:35.433
but, um, I live here
year around.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.785
Oh, right. You don't even
have any plants.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.048
What's that got to do
with anything?

11:42.179 --> 11:43.485
Never mind.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.748
You were saying?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.663
I get that you're gonna
be here for a month--

11:47.707 --> 11:49.491
Uh, it's five weeks, actually.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.842
Right. Either way, um,
I mean, I'll do my best

11:52.886 --> 11:55.192
but you might wanna just
learn how to relax.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.368
I'm sorry,
you want me to relax?

11:57.412 --> 11:59.370
Yeah, I mean,
it might be good for you.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.808
Just as a suggestion.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.595
Anything else?

12:06.638 --> 12:09.163
No, I think we're all set.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.428
Hmm.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.431
Good boy.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.434
Relax.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.044
Telling me to relax?

12:21.088 --> 12:23.438
Please, I'm totally relaxed.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.093
[sighs]

12:28.443 --> 12:30.184
[line ringing]

12:30.227 --> 12:33.448
Hey, so forget this
two-week rule.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.449
I need your help.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.633
Yeah, I think that should do it.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.940
If I had my way, I'd lock
you two in detention

12:46.983 --> 12:48.028
until you worked it out.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.464
But there's nothing to work out

12:49.507 --> 12:50.900
because I called it.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.249
So, he is Mr. Slack?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.251
And completely arrogant,
which is a deadly combo.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.079
[chuckles]
Oh, I thought you said

12:56.123 --> 12:57.428
this wall was for the dog.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.647
It is.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.170
It totally is.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.563
Oh, come on,
don't make me look crazy.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.478
I just think
it's a little extreme.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.480
Or an easy solution.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.090
Alright, now listen

13:07.134 --> 13:09.397
you want me to start
building a moat?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.572
This is far as I can go.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.575
Right. A moat.
See, that would be extreme.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.794
[chuckles]

13:16.839 --> 13:19.711
- Oh, hey.
- Wow, that was fast.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.757
Uh, so you got my note
about all this?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.150
Yeah, I got it.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.108
I just didn't think anyone
moved that quickly.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.719
On anything,
especially a wall.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.286
Well, it helps
to know a contractor.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.897
Oh, I thought it would help
to marry one

13:30.940 --> 13:32.072
but I'm still waiting
on my new porch.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.377
Well, that's because I've been

13:33.421 --> 13:34.770
so fixated on you, dear.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.250
You're lying,
but at least

13:36.293 --> 13:37.468
'you sound cute
when you're smiling.'

13:37.512 --> 13:38.513
[chuckles]

13:39.601 --> 13:41.516
Oh, sorry.
Maureen and Ian.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.952
- My good friends from home.
- Hi, Ian.

13:42.996 --> 13:43.953
- Nice to meet you.
- Lucas.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.085
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.000
We've heard so much about you.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.610
All good, of course.

13:48.653 --> 13:52.005
- Ah, now you're lying.
- Oh.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.442
- Should we go?
- Yeah, I think we should go.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.792
- Yeah, thanks. Uh, thank you.
- Yeah.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.141
I appreciate it.
See you guys.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.100
[Ian]
'Mm-hmm.'

14:00.143 --> 14:02.450
Just so you know,
the wall is for Tank

14:02.493 --> 14:05.845
to help me relax,
as you so poetically put it.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.760
Sure, it is.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.023
What's that supposed to mean?

14:10.066 --> 14:12.503
[kids chattering]

14:12.547 --> 14:13.809
Don't go too far.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.897
Stay where I can see you.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.116
[Ally]
Okay, mom.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.987
[Jenna]
'Have fun.'

14:18.031 --> 14:19.423
'Be safe.'

14:19.467 --> 14:21.686
'But have fun.'

14:21.730 --> 14:23.558
[indistinct chatter]

14:23.601 --> 14:24.907
I'm just saying I get it.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.126
- Get what?
- I get it.

14:26.169 --> 14:29.172
I'll keep my furry kid
on this side

14:29.216 --> 14:33.481
if you keep your kids on,
uh, that side.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.310
Oh, you want me
to keep my kids contained?

14:37.746 --> 14:39.443
It only seems fair.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.575
Doesn't it?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.578
Alright, fine.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.673
Yeah.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.544
I feel better already.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.985
[Ally]
How often do you walk him?

14:59.028 --> 15:01.248
I don't know,
he's kinda low-maintenance.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.206
'Cause I can do it
if you want.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.947
I think we're good.

15:04.991 --> 15:09.647
Or I could teach him
how to sit or roll over.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.258
I bet you're
a really good swimmer, right?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.737
- Since you surf all the time?
- Come on, Tank.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.479
- Ah, well, I wasn't always.
- But you are now.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.133
You guys always this
chatty in the morning?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.092
Not me, she's the early riser.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.442
Which is why I can walk
your dog.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.186
He likes to sleep in
while I'm surfing.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.883
Do you think you can
give me some pointers?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.319
- Come on, Tank.
- On surfing?

15:29.363 --> 15:30.799
Just swimming,
I wanna cut my time

15:30.842 --> 15:32.061
to make swim team next year.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.108
You know,
I'm not much of a teacher.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.326
- Even if--
- 'Sorry.'

15:36.370 --> 15:38.633
It's not really my thing, buddy.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.947
Who wants the first stack
of pancakes?

15:49.644 --> 15:51.472
Nick?

15:51.515 --> 15:52.734
Ally?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.301
[Tank barking]

15:56.607 --> 15:59.567
I think something's
wrong with him.

15:59.610 --> 16:03.571
He won't sit or listen.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.880
He likes to move
at his own pace.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.665
[sing-songy]
Kind of like his owner.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.235
You guys need to get ready
for camp or something?

16:15.278 --> 16:17.106
They do, which is why

16:17.150 --> 16:18.325
they should be upstairs
getting ready

16:18.368 --> 16:20.283
instead of down here
bothering you.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.981
Her words, not mine.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.158
Well, what if we're
already ready?

16:25.201 --> 16:27.160
Does that mean
you don't want your pancakes?

16:27.203 --> 16:28.596
I'm sure that Tank
would love to eat 'em.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.685
Oh, no, he prefers
small children.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.427
I'm kidding.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.471
[Jenna]
Cute.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.560
Did you put
chocolate chips in them?

16:36.604 --> 16:38.040
I might have.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.694
Yes, come on.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.178
I'll meet you up there.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.398
Well, have a nice day.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.226
I always do.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.446
[instrumental music]

16:54.535 --> 16:55.797
What are you thinking, boy?

16:55.840 --> 16:56.798
[barks]

16:57.799 --> 16:59.279
[chuckles]

16:59.322 --> 17:00.628
Me too.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.553
[whistle blows]

17:14.119 --> 17:15.946
Alright, good job, guys.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.471
Let's break for lunch.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.128
Alright, come on, dude.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.695
Those fish tacos are
calling your name.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.002
I'm not really that hungry.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.002
Yeah, well, I can't have anyone

17:28.047 --> 17:29.265
passing out on my watch.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.353
So, you're gonna have
to eat something.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.573
I promise they're worth it.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.837
Hi.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.143
[Lucas]
'Hey, you.'

17:37.186 --> 17:39.101
'Oh, looks like I'm just in time
for fish tacos.'

17:39.145 --> 17:40.189
Well, yeah, well, this week

17:40.233 --> 17:41.451
you're gonna have to
cut in line.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.931
- They're a hungry bunch.
- What?

17:42.974 --> 17:44.759
You didn't save me one?

17:44.802 --> 17:46.108
I'm gonna find some new friends.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.501
[chuckles]
Good luck with that, McKennon.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.286
[chuckles]
How's Nick doing out there?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.897
- You know him?
- Neighbor of the month.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.160
Well, he starts off strong

17:54.203 --> 17:56.162
and then he just
sort of picks up.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.728
But I'm sure he'll get there.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.774
I'm sure he will.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.734
[instrumental music]

18:03.778 --> 18:04.779
Hmm.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.615
[instrumental music]

18:17.792 --> 18:18.793
[sighs]

18:24.625 --> 18:26.105
Mm.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.889
[indistinct chatter]

18:35.984 --> 18:38.160
[rock music]

18:38.204 --> 18:39.466
What the..

18:42.338 --> 18:43.818
[indistinct chatter]

18:44.949 --> 18:46.734
- Whoo!
- Yeah, alright.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.128
Come on, man,
I'm trying to work.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.008
Oh.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.183
Oh, you're my man.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.315
Yeah.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.188
Uh-oh.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.755
Am I the only one
who works around here?

19:07.798 --> 19:08.973
Nah, I'm just kidding.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.584
But seriously, am I?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.542
If you haven't noticed,
volleyball is hard work.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.283
Yeah, especially
when you're winning.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.980
Hey, don't get ahead
of yourself, we just started.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.982
Yeah, well, I just started too,
and it's not going so well.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.462
So, I was hoping that maybe you
could just turn the music--

19:19.506 --> 19:21.986
Keep it quiet down a bit?

19:22.030 --> 19:24.250
Yeah, that would be awesome.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.338
- You got it.
- Yeah?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.427
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.865
- Alright, what is it?
- Four-four.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.954
'Yeah.'

19:32.997 --> 19:35.174
What? Too loud?

19:35.217 --> 19:38.177
- Little bit.
- We'll keep it down.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.309
- Set it up. Oh!
- Come on.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.702
[laughing]

19:41.745 --> 19:43.486
[rock music]

19:43.530 --> 19:45.401
Here is to my beach warriors

19:45.445 --> 19:48.404
and a fantastic summer at camp.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.797
How long is it again?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.320
Well, that's the spirit.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.843
Can we cheers now?

19:52.887 --> 19:54.062
Yes, cheers.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.324
[chuckles]

19:57.283 --> 19:59.894
Maybe I should just
learn to surf instead.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.243
Why would you wanna do that?

20:01.287 --> 20:02.679
We don't normally
live near the beach.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.986
I don't know,
our neighbor does it.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.688
Yeah, I'd rather you not try
anything our neighbor does ever.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.125
Okay, now tell me
how you really feel?

20:14.169 --> 20:17.216
No, it's not a feelings thing,
it's a health and safety thing.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.827
- Sure.
- What? It is.

20:19.870 --> 20:23.265
- Who wants steak?
- Alright.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.398
[instrumental music]

20:26.312 --> 20:27.878
Rise and shine, monkeys.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.837
It's the weekend.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.752
What time is it?

20:31.795 --> 20:33.580
I'm hungry.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.711
Then I guess we better hurry up

20:34.755 --> 20:35.973
and figure out
what we're gonna do?

20:36.017 --> 20:38.280
We could go
to the sand dunes

20:38.324 --> 20:40.064
'or the butterfly park.'

20:40.108 --> 20:41.936
Can we just go to the beach?

20:43.154 --> 20:44.591
Yeah, I guess we could
go to the beach.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.462
I don't know,
what do you wanna do, Ally?

20:46.506 --> 20:47.811
I wanna go to the beach.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.117
[laughs]

20:49.160 --> 20:50.945
Alright, the beach it is.
Let's do it.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.297
Wow, you're doing
a really thorough job.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.734
I can still see your toes.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.302
Yeah, maybe we should just
let 'em breathe a little bit.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.173
Nope, I need another bucket.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.349
[chuckles]

21:04.437 --> 21:06.439
Is that our neighbor out there?

21:06.482 --> 21:08.528
He's not a criminal, mom.

21:08.571 --> 21:11.531
- Why don't you like him?
- What?

21:11.574 --> 21:12.967
I didn't say I didn't like him.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.186
He has to be nice.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.666
His dog's nice.

21:16.710 --> 21:17.885
[laughs]

21:17.928 --> 21:20.670
I think owners look like
their dogs, sweetie.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.064
I'm not sure
they act like them.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.110
Where's my mermaid tail?

21:26.154 --> 21:27.286
[chuckles]

21:28.765 --> 21:31.681
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.901
How are your lap times
coming along?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.032
They're fine.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.208
Fine? What's that
supposed to mean?

21:37.252 --> 21:40.386
Doesn't matter. I'm not gonna
try out for swim team anymore.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.911
'Cause you don't want to,
or because you're afraid to?

21:43.954 --> 21:46.305
Listen, I know
this is not your thing.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.349
[chuckles]

21:47.393 --> 21:49.656
- Did I say that?
- Twice.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.747
You know,
a very wise dude once said..

21:53.790 --> 21:56.706
"You miss a hundred percent
of the shots you don't take."

21:56.750 --> 21:58.708
Is that some sort
of Yoda quote?

21:58.752 --> 22:00.667
No, that's a pretty
good guess, but no.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.800
It was, uh, Wayne Gretzky.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.933
- Does he surf?
- Okay, that's not the point.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.588
The point is
if you're interested..

22:08.631 --> 22:10.372
...and my schedule lightens up--

22:10.416 --> 22:12.722
My mom says
you don't have a schedule.

22:12.766 --> 22:16.160
Well, your mom
doesn't know everything.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.380
Like I said, I was thinking

22:18.424 --> 22:20.948
that if you're interested..

22:20.991 --> 22:23.080
...I could give you
some pointers.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.300
I mean, don't get too excited.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.388
Just 20 minutes, here and there.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.608
- Nothing major.
- Cool.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.785
I mean, yeah.
Sure, I'd be up for that.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.048
Alright, so we'll figure it out.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.533
- Oh, and, Lucas?
- Yeah?

22:40.576 --> 22:42.578
Can we maybe not
tell my mom about this?

22:42.622 --> 22:44.841
I'm not too sure
she'd like it.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.628
Mum's the word.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.804
Get it?
Sorry, I had to.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.372
[seagulls squawking]

22:53.415 --> 22:55.809
[instrumental music]

22:55.852 --> 22:57.027
[waves crashing]

23:01.902 --> 23:03.947
Alright, now to
strengthen your stroke

23:03.991 --> 23:06.036
you need to learn
how to swim like a surfer.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.473
Seriously?

23:07.516 --> 23:08.909
Just focus on shortening
the number of strokes it takes

23:08.952 --> 23:10.519
for you to get
to the other side of the pool

23:10.563 --> 23:13.566
and I promise you'll catch
a ton more waves.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.045
But I don't surf.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.090
That's not the point.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.397
You wanna break 118 or not?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.398
[sighs]

23:19.441 --> 23:21.574
Then, go, go, go!

23:24.315 --> 23:27.144
Wow. What, are you getting
soft in your old age?

23:27.188 --> 23:29.495
This helping kids thing
is new for you.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.062
It's one kid, just one time.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.237
Well, that's what you think.

23:33.281 --> 23:34.500
Easy breezy, right?

23:34.543 --> 23:35.849
They go in for the hug,
and it's all over.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.154
The next thing you know,
you're wearing

23:37.198 --> 23:38.417
mouse ears at Disneyland

23:38.460 --> 23:40.419
because you couldn't
bear to say no.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.898
- Are you done?
- Maybe.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.247
[Lucas]
'Yeah, maybe, maybe,
maybe, maybe.'

23:43.291 --> 23:46.076
[chuckles]
Hey, stop, stop.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.952
[guitar music]

23:54.302 --> 23:55.782
[fire crackling]

23:57.610 --> 23:59.133
[indistinct chatter]

24:03.006 --> 24:05.444
I don't think we have enough
marshmallows for everyone.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.968
Actually, I don't think there's
enough room for us, sweetie.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.448
Sure, there is.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.582
Hey, you guys wanna squeeze in?

24:13.626 --> 24:15.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.717
It looks like you're having
a party, we can just come back.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.197
Trust me, you'd know
if we were having a party.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.156
Scoot over.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.766
Who wants marshmallows?

24:23.810 --> 24:26.029
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.422
See?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.119
Plenty of room.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.904
[guitar strumming]

24:30.947 --> 24:31.948
Yeah.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.953
[Ally]
'Can I wake him up?'

24:36.997 --> 24:39.608
See how his eyelids
are fluttering?

24:39.652 --> 24:43.873
That means he's just about
reached REM cycle.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.049
- His what?
- 'Ally, honey.'

24:46.093 --> 24:48.487
Why don't we leave
Mr. Tank alone, okay?

24:49.183 --> 24:50.532
But..

24:50.576 --> 24:52.273
...daddy said
I could get a dog.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.622
I'm sure he did, honey

24:53.666 --> 24:56.277
but dog sure would be
kinda tough right now.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.452
We've talked about this.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.020
Can't you just change your mind?

25:00.063 --> 25:01.630
She doesn't do that.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.284
How about this,
how about you take Tank

25:03.327 --> 25:05.547
for a walk tomorrow morning?
Would you like that?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.593
[chuckles]
Awesome.

25:07.636 --> 25:10.073
Wow, that is pretty nice.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.640
You sound surprised.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.817
I'm not surprised, I'm just..

25:18.778 --> 25:21.302
Actually, I think
we should get going.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.522
- We should?
- Yeah.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
Oh, right.

25:26.046 --> 25:29.223
Yeah, we should,
'cause I'm pretty wiped

25:29.266 --> 25:32.531
'and I've been working
on this new swim technique.'

25:32.574 --> 25:33.662
It's pretty cool, actually.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.185
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.491
My mom likes to watch
"Real Housewives--"

25:36.535 --> 25:38.798
Okay, we're going now.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.713
Let's go, please, now.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.149
- Come on.
- What? You do.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.412
- Could you just stop?
- Goodnight.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.283
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Tank.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.372
See you in the morning.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.636
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:50.679 --> 25:53.377
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Yeah.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.336
There's room on this side.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.904
[instrumental music]

26:00.167 --> 26:01.168
[Jenna sighs]

26:04.258 --> 26:05.912
[instrumental music]

26:09.437 --> 26:10.743
[snoring]

26:12.440 --> 26:13.920
[knock on glass]

26:15.095 --> 26:16.357
[Tank whimpers]

26:18.925 --> 26:20.143
[knocking continues]

26:20.187 --> 26:22.276
[sighs]
You wanna get that, buddy?

26:22.319 --> 26:23.582
[whimpers]

26:26.759 --> 26:29.370
Alright, alright,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.111
[grunts]

26:32.591 --> 26:34.854
Some guard dog you are.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.031
God.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.299
You said morning.
Leash, please?

26:47.518 --> 26:49.564
You left your door open.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.870
Alright, I don't have any rules.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.872
Just bring him back
when you're done.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.439
You sure you don't
wanna come with us?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.746
That would defeat the purpose
of you walking my dog.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.619
Except you might have fun.

27:00.662 --> 27:03.360
Nah, I'm good.
I should get back to my nap.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.058
Suit yourself.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.276
Go on.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.148
[chuckles]

27:09.671 --> 27:10.803
[Tank barks]

27:13.283 --> 27:15.764
[instrumental music]

27:15.808 --> 27:17.331
[barking]

27:18.637 --> 27:21.117
Tank, come on, spin.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.075
[Ally sighs]

27:22.118 --> 27:23.424
'Tank!'

27:23.467 --> 27:24.643
'Please.'

27:24.686 --> 27:26.427
[barking]

27:26.470 --> 27:28.255
Come on, Tank.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.430
Come on, spin around.

27:29.473 --> 27:30.736
- Spin around.
- Sorry, buddy.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.652
- She's a taskmaster.
- Tank, get up, get up.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.828
Just like her mama.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.352
[sighs]

27:38.395 --> 27:39.353
[whimpers]

27:41.877 --> 27:42.878
[Nick]
'I don't get it.'

27:42.922 --> 27:45.141
So, she's learning to sail

27:45.185 --> 27:48.754
but it's only so she can get
to the Lost Island?

27:48.797 --> 27:50.103
That's the idea.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.322
At least that's
how I'm writing the first draft.

27:52.366 --> 27:53.976
And she's only 11?

27:54.020 --> 27:57.327
So, does that mean in two more
years, I can sail too?

27:57.371 --> 27:59.982
[laughs]
It's just fiction, sweetie.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.811
Besides, she comes
from a long line of sailors.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.639
Your grandparents
came from Chicago.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.510
Two very different scenarios.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.382
So, how does it end?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.037
That's a good question.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.388
I thought it was due,
like, really soon.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.129
Soon-ish.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.698
But I'm not worried,
so you can't be worried.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.223
Great, should we go home?

28:25.660 --> 28:27.401
Go, go, go on, boy. Get it over.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.707
That's it.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.230
- Uh!
- Oh.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.710
Ahh, what up?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.976
Oh, come on.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.413
Hey, bud.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.503
[Lucas groaning]

28:42.546 --> 28:43.765
[laughs]

28:43.809 --> 28:46.028
Hey, Lucas, do you need
any more players?

28:46.072 --> 28:47.900
Yeah, I guess we could
use some extra bodies.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.379
Why, you interested?

28:49.423 --> 28:50.946
What about my mom?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.732
- What about her?
- She used to play in college.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.343
Really?

28:56.386 --> 28:58.737
Hey, you used to dig?

28:59.650 --> 29:00.869
What do you mean?

29:00.913 --> 29:02.218
[Nick]
'Oh, I was just telling Lucas'

29:02.262 --> 29:04.786
how you used to play
volleyball in college.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
It was like a 100 years ago.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.398
You should play.

29:08.442 --> 29:09.443
Right now?

29:09.486 --> 29:10.661
Are you any good?

29:10.705 --> 29:12.054
Team captain.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.231
Huh. I'm having
a hard time picturing that.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.929

I appreciate what you've
been doing for Nick.

39:48.516 --> 39:49.952
I'm really not doing much.

39:49.996 --> 39:50.997
That's not what he said.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.433
Well, then he's being
very generous.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.043
I'm just helpin' out
where I can.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.350
- It's nothing.
- Maybe.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.352
Or maybe you care a little bit

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
more than you want
anyone to know?

40:03.879 --> 40:07.405
Either way, I hope
you enjoy the treats.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.884
[scoffs]
Are you kidding?

40:08.928 --> 40:11.931
Rainbow-colored food
is my favorite type of food.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.236
[chuckles]

40:13.280 --> 40:16.065
Okay, I guess they
know you better than I do.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.110
[chuckles]

40:19.721 --> 40:22.420
So, you'll keep me in the loop?

40:23.464 --> 40:24.944
I will now.

40:25.945 --> 40:27.860
Great, thanks.

40:28.904 --> 40:30.036
Goodnight.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.733
Goodnight.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.127
[instrumental music]

40:36.303 --> 40:38.218
Well, I guess they're stayin'.

40:41.264 --> 40:42.744
Hm.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.444
I'm king of the mountains.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.532
You can't be king.

40:47.575 --> 40:48.707
Why? Because I'm a girl?

40:48.750 --> 40:50.273
No, because I'm king.

40:50.317 --> 40:52.275
- No, I'm king!
- No, I'm king.

40:52.319 --> 40:53.755
- 'I'm king.'
- 'I'm king.'

40:53.799 --> 40:55.714
- 'I'm king.'
- Alright, you're both kings.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.150
Now, everybody in their seats.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.021
We're supposed to be there
in ten minutes.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.327
[Lucas]
'Y'all wanna keep it
down out here?'

41:00.370 --> 41:01.937
I am tryin' to sleep.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.157
It's five o'clock
in the afternoon.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.768
I was kidding.
It was a joke.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.727
Oh, were you
pretending to be me?

41:09.597 --> 41:11.207
Ha ha. Very funny.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.774
I try.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.733
You guys heading
to the concert in the park?

41:14.776 --> 41:17.126
If everybody will get
in their seats, yes.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.258
Are you coming too?

41:18.301 --> 41:19.781
Every Thursday.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.304
Lucky.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.784
Why don't I drive you?

41:24.220 --> 41:25.744
You want us to ride in that?

41:25.787 --> 41:27.006
Mm-hmm.

41:29.617 --> 41:30.792
- Cool!
- Cool!

41:30.836 --> 41:33.099
- Can we? Please?
- Can we? Please?

41:33.142 --> 41:35.623
I mean, does the thing
even have seatbelts?

41:38.017 --> 41:40.019
[laughing]

41:40.062 --> 41:41.803
[cheering]

41:41.847 --> 41:44.676
- This is awesome.
- Okay, this is pretty cool.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.460
Not as bad as you thought?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.722
[chuckles]

41:47.766 --> 41:49.419
Oh, poor Tank.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.464
[Jenna]
No, not bad at all.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.813
[Lucas]
Whoo!

41:52.684 --> 41:54.207
[instrumental music]

41:55.382 --> 41:57.210
[indistinct chatter]

41:58.298 --> 41:59.560
So, do you think you might

41:59.604 --> 42:02.302
have time for another lesson?

42:02.345 --> 42:04.260
Under one condition.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.566
No hugging.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.176
I don't get it.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.569
Why would I..

42:08.613 --> 42:11.006
- Hi.
- Hi, Kayla.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.834
- Oh, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

42:12.878 --> 42:15.184
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take Tank?

42:15.228 --> 42:16.969
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah, thank you.

42:17.012 --> 42:19.493
- I'll catch you in a bit, okay?
- Oh, that's okay.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.016
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.540
[Maureen]
For being so punctual

42:22.583 --> 42:23.932
you're real late.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.369
I'm sorry, we decided
to ride share.

42:26.413 --> 42:28.546
You decided to what?

42:28.589 --> 42:29.808
Oh, right!

42:29.851 --> 42:31.549
- Hey, neighbor.
- Hey!

42:31.592 --> 42:33.725
- You surprised to see me?
- 'Maybe.'

42:33.768 --> 42:35.248
So, does this mean
we're making more room?

42:35.291 --> 42:36.597
- Or building a wall?
- Ha ha ha.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.904
Uh, makin' more room.
Right, Lucas?

42:41.123 --> 42:43.125
Actually, I think Lucas
is meeting his girlfriend.

42:43.169 --> 42:44.997
- So, we should just--
- My what?

42:45.040 --> 42:45.867
Your girlfriend?

42:45.911 --> 42:47.826
Who's that? Oh, Kayla!

42:47.869 --> 42:49.305
[Lucas]
'Oh, no, no, she's, um..'

42:49.349 --> 42:50.698
Oh, we've known each other
for years.

42:50.742 --> 42:51.873
She's like a
little sister to me.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.048
[Maureen]
So, she's not your girlfriend?

42:53.092 --> 42:54.310
[Lucas]
'No, she's definitely'

42:54.354 --> 42:55.573
'not my girlfriend.'

42:55.616 --> 42:57.531
She's just a, a good friend

42:57.575 --> 42:58.967
that I happen to employ.

42:59.011 --> 43:01.317
What do you mean employ?
At the summer camp?

43:01.361 --> 43:03.668
Yeah, well, technically,
you can call it mysummer camp

43:03.711 --> 43:05.147
'but I've never been one for..'

43:05.191 --> 43:06.714
'...job titles.'

43:06.758 --> 43:08.411
Oh, you are definitely
joining us.

43:08.455 --> 43:10.022
- Well, alright. Absolutely.
- Thank you.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.284
[laughs]

43:18.030 --> 43:19.509
[Lucas]
Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.

43:19.553 --> 43:20.598
I mean, to be able to, uh..

43:20.641 --> 43:22.208
make a living doing this.

43:22.251 --> 43:24.689
[Maureen]
So, you own the summer camp?

43:24.732 --> 43:27.213
That's why you're always there?

43:27.256 --> 43:29.258
Well, I also like the free food
at the snack bar.

43:29.302 --> 43:30.520
So, there's that.

43:30.564 --> 43:31.913
[laughs]

43:31.957 --> 43:33.698
You really did the whole
corporate thing?

43:33.741 --> 43:35.613
Yeah. For a while.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.527
To save up some money
for the camp.

43:37.571 --> 43:40.922
Luckily I made some
good investments.

43:40.966 --> 43:43.925
I can't believe it.
I'm shocked.

43:43.969 --> 43:44.752
What part?

43:44.796 --> 43:45.927
That I own the place?

43:45.971 --> 43:48.626
Or that I actually have
a schedule?

43:49.931 --> 43:51.150
Nick mentioned that?

43:51.193 --> 43:53.065
He sure did.

43:53.108 --> 43:54.501
[Maureen]
'Kids are like parrots.'

43:54.544 --> 43:55.763
They repeat everything you say.

43:55.807 --> 43:57.243
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:57.286 --> 43:59.288
Yeah, I mean, he must have
taken it out of context.

43:59.332 --> 44:00.942
Hey, it's not a big deal.

44:00.986 --> 44:03.423
I would've assumed
that I was unemployed too.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.078
[chuckles]

44:07.688 --> 44:09.168
You're funny.

44:09.211 --> 44:11.257
How's that?

44:11.300 --> 44:12.650
I don't know.

44:12.693 --> 44:14.826
Just...can't figure you out.

44:15.827 --> 44:17.785
What can I say?

44:17.829 --> 44:19.787
I'm full of surprises.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.791
[chuckles]

44:23.835 --> 44:25.793
[instrumental music]

44:31.103 --> 44:32.844
[Nick chuckles]

44:38.023 --> 44:39.502
You see, he's not such a bad guy

44:39.546 --> 44:40.808
once you get to know him.

44:40.852 --> 44:42.723
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

44:42.767 --> 44:45.378
No, I didn't think
he was a bad guy.

44:45.421 --> 44:46.858
No?

44:46.901 --> 44:49.251
Uh, alright, I wasn't
a huge fan at first

44:49.295 --> 44:51.776
but he's been really amazing
to my kids.

44:51.819 --> 44:54.256
So, there you go.

44:54.300 --> 44:55.997
[Tank barks]

44:56.041 --> 44:58.696
I actually thought
you two were together.

44:58.739 --> 45:00.393
Oh! Please, I'm so
not his type.

45:00.436 --> 45:01.437
And he's not mine.

45:01.481 --> 45:02.612
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.266
'Cause I think
you're everybody's type.

45:04.310 --> 45:06.268
We're just friends.

45:06.312 --> 45:07.443
Well, that's good.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.054
I mean, either way
it would have been good

45:09.097 --> 45:11.012
but...good.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.318
[exhales]

45:12.361 --> 45:13.536
[chuckles]

45:13.580 --> 45:14.842
- A cone.
- Oh. Yes.

45:14.886 --> 45:18.541
Hi, um, can I get
the lemon sherbet, please?

45:18.585 --> 45:21.501
Can I just give you
a friendly warning?

45:21.544 --> 45:22.589
That sounds ominous.

45:22.632 --> 45:24.069
He's a sweet guy, for sure.

45:24.112 --> 45:26.767
But a family man, he is not.

45:26.811 --> 45:29.291
He likes his freedom
way too much.

45:29.335 --> 45:31.206
Well, then I..

45:31.250 --> 45:33.556
...guess it's alright that
I'm not looking for anything.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.471
You sure about that?

45:35.515 --> 45:36.821
Yeah, and I've already

45:36.864 --> 45:38.823
been disappointed
by one relationship.

45:38.866 --> 45:41.086
- I'm not trying for another.
- Hmm.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.567
- Your sherbet is ready.
- Oh, thank you.

45:44.611 --> 45:46.395
Thank you.

45:46.439 --> 45:48.049
- Bye.
- Bye.

45:48.093 --> 45:49.268
Hi.

45:49.311 --> 45:50.922
Um..

45:50.965 --> 45:52.793
...how about two vanillas

45:52.837 --> 45:55.753
and one strawberry sorbet?

46:07.329 --> 46:09.897
[seagulls squawking]

46:13.640 --> 46:17.209
I probably shouldn't
ask this, but..

46:17.252 --> 46:20.038
...why are we here
and not at the pool?

46:20.081 --> 46:22.214
You see that out there?

46:22.910 --> 46:24.999
Yeah, the old lighthouse?

46:25.043 --> 46:26.871
Yeah, well, that old lighthouse

46:26.914 --> 46:28.916
is how I get over
my fear of swimming.

46:28.960 --> 46:32.354
Oh, please!
You were never afraid.

46:32.398 --> 46:33.573
You're right.

46:33.616 --> 46:35.183
I was terrified.

46:35.227 --> 46:38.099
- Of what?
- The open water.

46:38.143 --> 46:40.885
And that's not so great,
if all you wanna do is surf.

46:40.928 --> 46:42.800
So, I told myself if I could

46:42.843 --> 46:44.410
swim out to that old lighthouse

46:44.453 --> 46:47.456
and back again, I'd just drop
this whole scared stuff.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.762
How old were you?

46:48.806 --> 46:49.981
I don't know.

46:50.024 --> 46:51.678
Probably about your age.

46:51.721 --> 46:54.855
Oh, great, so now, you want
meto swim out there too?

46:54.899 --> 46:55.943
To improve my time?

46:55.987 --> 46:57.379
No, definitely not.

46:57.423 --> 46:59.904
In hindsight,
it wasn't the most logical plan.

47:01.427 --> 47:02.602
Look..

47:02.645 --> 47:04.256
I'm not worried
about your swim trials.

47:04.299 --> 47:06.606
I know you're gonna
hit your time.

47:06.649 --> 47:08.695
All I'm trying to say is

47:08.738 --> 47:10.784
it's pretty amazing how strong

47:10.828 --> 47:13.526
you can be
if you're pushed to it.

47:13.569 --> 47:15.920
Even if to push yourself.

47:15.963 --> 47:18.487
Wow. That was kinda deep.

47:19.967 --> 47:21.664
Well, don't
get used to it, kid.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.666
Deep is boring.

47:23.710 --> 47:25.625
- You hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

47:25.668 --> 47:27.105
I'll race you to lunch.

47:27.148 --> 47:28.976
- Okay.
- Alright.

47:30.499 --> 47:31.979
[crickets chirping]

47:40.683 --> 47:42.555
[instrumental music]

47:46.907 --> 47:47.952
[sighs]

47:47.995 --> 47:49.475
Okay.

47:52.217 --> 47:53.958
I prefer this blue
than the other blue

47:54.001 --> 47:56.699
if we're gonna go
with the blue for food.

47:56.743 --> 47:57.918
Yeah, yeah, it's just that--

47:57.962 --> 48:00.094
Are you really
having a party on a Tuesday?

48:00.138 --> 48:02.009
Are we really being that loud?

48:02.053 --> 48:04.490
Look, I don't mean
to be a killjoy, but..

48:04.533 --> 48:05.752
It's nice to see you.

48:05.795 --> 48:07.145
Look, don't.

48:07.188 --> 48:08.624
Don't try to charm
your way out of this one.

48:08.668 --> 48:09.974
I won that bet fair and square.

48:10.017 --> 48:11.976
Oh, so, you think I'm charming?

48:12.019 --> 48:13.412
What, what? No.

48:13.455 --> 48:14.500
You sure?

48:14.543 --> 48:16.589
Stop trying to change
the subject.

48:16.632 --> 48:17.720
It isn't a party.

48:17.764 --> 48:18.808
No? Like, what is it?

48:18.852 --> 48:20.071
Uh, a hangout?

48:20.114 --> 48:21.246
We're working.

48:21.289 --> 48:23.030
- You're working?
- Well..

48:23.074 --> 48:24.989
...that guy over
in the corner isn't.

48:25.032 --> 48:26.512
[Lucas]
'But everyone else is.'

48:26.555 --> 48:29.297
We just wrapped a little
promotional video.

48:29.341 --> 48:30.603
[Fred]
'It's not little.'

48:30.646 --> 48:31.604
Somebody wants to franchise

48:31.647 --> 48:32.997
the summer camp.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.520
Someone wants to invest?

48:34.563 --> 48:35.913
Like a Shark Tank guy?

48:35.956 --> 48:38.219
Actually, an old classmate
of mine from Berkeley.

48:38.263 --> 48:41.875
And he comes down next week,
so it is crunch time.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.703
[laughs]

48:43.746 --> 48:46.532
Wait, you went to UC Berkeley?

48:46.575 --> 48:49.274
Just for my MBA.

48:49.317 --> 48:52.320
[sighs]
Hence, the two-week rule.

48:52.364 --> 48:53.408
What's that?

48:53.452 --> 48:55.889
Nothing.
You're obviously busy.

48:55.933 --> 48:58.848
So, I'm gonna get going.

48:58.892 --> 49:00.198
Jenna?

49:00.241 --> 49:01.634
Yes.

49:01.677 --> 49:03.592
We'll keep it down.

49:03.636 --> 49:04.942
Thank you.

49:06.639 --> 49:09.163
You really
are full of surprises.

49:09.207 --> 49:11.296
[instrumental music]

49:21.306 --> 49:23.177
Hey, did you guys
remember your socks?

49:23.221 --> 49:24.222
Can't fall without 'em.

49:24.265 --> 49:25.919
Don't want foot fungus.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.877
Well, yeah, I think
we get the idea, but..

49:27.921 --> 49:30.010
[chuckles]
Have fun.

49:30.054 --> 49:31.055
Happy birthday, Grayson.

49:31.098 --> 49:33.666
- Thanks, Mrs. T.
- Yeah.

49:33.709 --> 49:35.973
You better relax tonight.
It's your one night off.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.757
- I will.
- You promise?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.672
- I swear.
- Okay.

49:39.715 --> 49:40.760
Drive safe.

49:40.803 --> 49:42.327
[engine starts]

49:51.684 --> 49:53.033
Oh, come on.

49:53.077 --> 49:54.992
Really?

49:55.035 --> 49:57.168
[Tank barks]

49:58.821 --> 50:00.171
[Tank barks]

50:01.911 --> 50:04.305
[Lucas]
'Tank, come eat.'

50:05.611 --> 50:08.048
Hello? Lucas?

50:08.092 --> 50:09.615
[instrumental music]

50:14.446 --> 50:15.664
I'm sorry.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.797
Can barely hear you
over that wall.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.755
Ha ha.
Never gets old, does it?

50:19.799 --> 50:21.496
No.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.890
I was wondering, if maybe
I could use your barbeque.

50:23.933 --> 50:25.370
I just have this one thing.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.459
Where are the kids?

50:27.502 --> 50:29.765
- Birthday party.
- Oh, lucky you.

50:29.809 --> 50:30.984
Yeah.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.073
You don't outsource
much, do you?

50:33.117 --> 50:34.988
Not usually, no.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.208
It's actually kinda nice
to have the night off.

50:38.644 --> 50:41.342
And, uh, that's what
you're eating?

50:41.386 --> 50:43.083
I was gonna put cheese on it.

50:43.127 --> 50:45.477
[exhales]
That is pitiful.

50:46.260 --> 50:47.653
Grab your cardigan.

50:47.696 --> 50:49.307
Why? You takin' me out?

50:49.350 --> 50:50.569
Maybe.

50:53.702 --> 50:55.313
It's not that bad.

51:00.274 --> 51:01.841
[Lucas]
This place never gets old.

51:01.884 --> 51:05.018
Even with all the crazy
tourists, I just love it here.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.976
I can't believe you've been
coming here for four years

51:07.020 --> 51:08.456
and you've never
been to Sam's.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.458
- Not that I remember.
- Oh, no, you'd remember.

51:10.502 --> 51:12.156
This is the best food
you're gonna have in town.

51:12.199 --> 51:13.331
Ain't that right, Sam?

51:13.374 --> 51:14.810
- 'Lucas!'
- Ha ha.

51:14.854 --> 51:17.030
- How's it going?
- Good, if you're hungry.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.205
We got an early bite.

51:18.249 --> 51:20.077
This is as fresh as it gets.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.556
What are you feeling like?

51:21.600 --> 51:22.949
Um, I don't know.

51:22.992 --> 51:25.560
- I eat everything.
- Oh, a girl after my own heart.

51:25.604 --> 51:26.866
Well, except for cucumbers.

51:26.909 --> 51:28.433
People say they don't
taste like anything

51:28.476 --> 51:29.521
but they totally permeate

51:29.564 --> 51:31.000
even if it just touches a leaf.

51:31.044 --> 51:32.915
If you're trying to make me
revise my previous statement

51:32.959 --> 51:34.700
it's not gonna work.

51:34.743 --> 51:36.136
Then, I eat everything.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.311
[chuckles]

51:37.355 --> 51:38.791
How about you give us

51:38.834 --> 51:41.272
a whole crab,
some of your garlic shrimp

51:41.315 --> 51:43.839
uh, two rolls
and a stack of napkins.

51:43.883 --> 51:45.754
- Comin' up.
- Thank you.

51:45.798 --> 51:47.278
[instrumental music]

51:51.717 --> 51:53.022
I bet you bring
all your neighbors here.

51:53.066 --> 51:54.328
[laughs]

51:54.372 --> 51:56.113
Only the impossible ones.

51:56.156 --> 51:57.810
Oh.

51:57.853 --> 51:59.290
I'm flattered.

52:00.813 --> 52:02.858
[Jenna]
I've run through, like,
50 napkins

52:02.902 --> 52:04.338
and you haven't even used one.

52:04.382 --> 52:05.905
Okay, so, the trick is

52:05.948 --> 52:07.776
you need to know how to grab

52:07.820 --> 52:09.213
the crab.

52:09.256 --> 52:10.910
See, first..

52:10.953 --> 52:11.911
...you take up all the legs

52:11.954 --> 52:13.739
and you hope you get some meat.

52:13.782 --> 52:14.914
No luck, no dice.

52:14.957 --> 52:16.916
And then..
Oh, this is a male.

52:16.959 --> 52:19.179
- And they.. Heh. Sorry.
- Ugh!

52:19.223 --> 52:22.139
[laughs]
I think I need another napkin.

52:22.182 --> 52:23.401
You can have the whole stack.

52:23.444 --> 52:25.098
[laughs]

52:25.142 --> 52:26.665
[Jenna groans]

52:26.708 --> 52:29.450
When did you suddenly
become the neat one?

52:29.494 --> 52:31.017
See, now you sound
like Ally.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.758
She just says it
like it is.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.194
It's pretty impressive.

52:34.238 --> 52:36.196
Yeah, she really
likes you.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.980
They both do.

52:38.024 --> 52:40.026
Well, they have
impeccable taste.

52:40.069 --> 52:41.680
[laughs]

52:43.247 --> 52:45.205
Uh, okay, I, you know what?

52:45.249 --> 52:48.295
I think I'm done with this guy,
but it was delicious.

52:48.339 --> 52:50.036
Best in town.

52:50.079 --> 52:51.168
Yeah.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.343
[sighs]

52:56.564 --> 52:58.871
You ready for your big meeting?

52:58.914 --> 53:00.133
Yeah.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.308
I think as long as
I get a good surf in

53:01.352 --> 53:03.310
beforehand, I'll be fine.

53:03.354 --> 53:04.616
You have a tie?

53:04.659 --> 53:06.270
Do I need a tie?

53:06.313 --> 53:08.968
You said they're
pretty corporate.

53:09.011 --> 53:10.535
I'm not worried.

53:12.145 --> 53:13.886
Are you always this relaxed?

53:15.453 --> 53:17.455
As long as I've done
the best that I can on my end

53:17.498 --> 53:19.196
then just let the rest go.

53:20.545 --> 53:22.721
Yeah, I wish
I could do that.

53:24.113 --> 53:25.593
Let things go?

53:25.637 --> 53:27.813
Stop trying to control
things from all sides.

53:27.856 --> 53:30.729
Well, you got a few more sides
to deal with than I do.

53:30.772 --> 53:32.296
Hm. Heh.

53:32.339 --> 53:34.254
And you're killing it,
by the way.

53:34.298 --> 53:35.516
Killing it?

53:35.560 --> 53:36.952
- You think so?
- Yeah.

53:36.996 --> 53:38.998
'Cause I don't even have
an ending for my book.

53:39.041 --> 53:40.652
Isn't that normal
for writers?

53:40.695 --> 53:41.653
I don't know.

53:41.696 --> 53:44.090
It's only my second novel.

53:44.133 --> 53:45.570
I mean..

53:45.613 --> 53:47.311
What if I only have
one good one in me?

53:47.354 --> 53:49.965
Hey, don't sell yourself short.

53:50.009 --> 53:51.010
Look at everything you're doing.

53:51.053 --> 53:52.272
You're working from home

53:52.316 --> 53:53.882
you're raising two kids.

53:53.926 --> 53:56.494
Their dad is actually really
helpful when he's not traveling.

53:56.537 --> 53:57.886
You guys still friends?

53:57.930 --> 54:00.498
Friendship was never
really our problem.

54:02.891 --> 54:08.506
We just had very...
different views on life.

54:08.549 --> 54:11.552
I wish I'd figured
that out sooner.

54:11.596 --> 54:13.728
Then we wouldn't be here.

54:15.513 --> 54:16.731
Yes.

54:16.775 --> 54:19.734
This is...very true.

54:19.778 --> 54:20.779
[chuckles]

54:23.303 --> 54:24.913
Don't worry.

54:24.957 --> 54:26.524
I got a feeling
that your sequel's gonna

54:26.567 --> 54:29.091
be even better than your first.

54:29.135 --> 54:30.789
[instrumental music]

54:32.965 --> 54:34.140
Here.

54:34.183 --> 54:36.360
Oh, it's fine.

54:36.403 --> 54:39.276
- I'm fine.
- I know you're fine.

54:39.319 --> 54:40.842
I'd still like
to give it to you

54:40.886 --> 54:42.409
if that's okay.

54:44.237 --> 54:46.021
Okay.

54:46.065 --> 54:48.372
[instrumental music]

54:48.415 --> 54:50.635
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

55:08.174 --> 55:10.611
Well...this is me.

55:12.657 --> 55:15.312
Looks like your neighbor's
a real slob.

55:15.355 --> 55:16.487
Yeah, well, it's his dog.

55:16.530 --> 55:18.576
He's really well behaved,
o there's that.

55:18.619 --> 55:19.968
[laughs]

55:22.580 --> 55:24.582
Oh, uh, thanks for this.

55:24.625 --> 55:27.585
- Oh, yeah.
- And for tonight.

55:27.628 --> 55:30.588
- It was fun.
- Yeah, it was.

55:33.068 --> 55:34.983
I guess, I'll see you tomorrow.

55:35.027 --> 55:37.072
Yes, yes, you will.
You will see me tomorrow.

55:37.116 --> 55:39.336
Not that you have
much of a choice.

55:39.379 --> 55:40.293
True.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.034
[laughs]
Okay.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.298
Okay, well, um, goodnight.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.691
Goodnight.

55:48.954 --> 55:50.347
[laughs]

55:56.831 --> 55:58.180
Okay. Bye.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.834
Bye. Goodnight.

55:59.878 --> 56:01.140
Goodnight.

56:06.450 --> 56:08.060
[instrumental music]

56:12.020 --> 56:13.544
Huh!

56:18.287 --> 56:19.724
[sighs]

56:20.551 --> 56:22.161
[instrumental music]

56:22.204 --> 56:24.381
[knock at door]

56:29.124 --> 56:31.518
Leash, please.

56:32.519 --> 56:34.391
[Lucas]
Come on.

56:39.221 --> 56:41.267
Wait. Where are you going?

56:41.310 --> 56:43.269
Well, I thought
I'd tag along today.

56:43.312 --> 56:44.705
If that's alright with you?

56:44.749 --> 56:47.229
Are you kidding? Yes.

56:47.273 --> 56:49.231
Here you go.

56:49.275 --> 56:52.409
- Lead the way.
- Hmm. Awesome.

56:54.106 --> 56:57.239
You mind tellin' me
where we're goin'?

56:57.283 --> 56:58.763
Right here.

56:58.806 --> 57:02.810
Sit down.
It's his favorite spot.

57:02.854 --> 57:03.855
Okay.

57:03.898 --> 57:05.117
It took him a while to warm up.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.423
[sighs]

57:06.466 --> 57:08.294
Well, he's not really
a morning dog.

57:08.337 --> 57:11.602
Or a trick dog for that matter.

57:12.341 --> 57:13.865
Sit.

57:15.519 --> 57:17.042
Shake.

57:19.131 --> 57:20.915
High five!

57:20.959 --> 57:22.439
[giggles]

57:23.222 --> 57:24.484
That's amazing.

57:24.528 --> 57:27.052
See, he just didn't know
what he was missing.

57:27.095 --> 57:30.795
[Ally]
Huh. Come, Tank.

57:30.838 --> 57:32.144
Huh.

57:34.581 --> 57:37.366
So, I told him no hot tub

57:37.410 --> 57:38.759
until he finishes the porch.

57:38.803 --> 57:41.066
You think that'll work?

57:41.109 --> 57:43.111
The man wants a hot tub.

57:47.420 --> 57:50.467
So, you're buying a gift

57:50.510 --> 57:53.295
for Lucas, from the kids?

57:53.339 --> 57:55.428
Yeah, the kids want to get
him something for good luck

57:55.472 --> 57:57.169
since he's coming over
for dinner.

57:57.212 --> 58:00.128
Wait. What?

58:00.172 --> 58:01.739
When?

58:01.782 --> 58:03.349
Tonight.

58:03.392 --> 58:05.656
I can't believe we've been
hanging for over an one hour

58:05.699 --> 58:07.309
and you're just
telling me this now.

58:07.353 --> 58:08.572
It's not a big deal.

58:08.615 --> 58:10.791
Hello, you've barely dated
since your divorce.

58:10.835 --> 58:12.880
Yeah, well,
I've been a little busy.

58:12.924 --> 58:15.492
- For the last four years?
- Yeah.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.800
It's okay to feel excited.

58:21.236 --> 58:23.848
Alright, fine. I mean..

58:23.891 --> 58:26.633
If it makes you feel more
comfortable it's not a big deal.

58:26.677 --> 58:28.200
Thank you.

58:28.243 --> 58:30.202
But you still need a new dress.

58:31.943 --> 58:33.161
[gasps]

58:33.205 --> 58:36.121
What about this one?

58:36.164 --> 58:37.905
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

58:37.949 --> 58:39.298
You can't wear
khakis on a date.

58:39.341 --> 58:42.214
It's not a date.
It's dinner with the kids.

58:42.257 --> 58:43.911
Tomato tomahto.

58:43.955 --> 58:45.304
Can I help you find a size?

58:45.347 --> 58:47.045
- Yes.
- No.

58:47.698 --> 58:50.135
Just try it on.

58:50.178 --> 58:51.353
Please?

58:51.397 --> 58:53.791
Fine. But it's not a date.

58:53.834 --> 58:56.358
No, of course not.

58:56.402 --> 58:58.665
[whispers]
It's a date.

58:58.709 --> 59:00.188
[giggles]

59:02.539 --> 59:04.541
[instrumental music]

59:19.773 --> 59:23.037
Wow. You look different.

59:23.081 --> 59:26.084
[scoffs]
You look incredible.

59:27.259 --> 59:29.478
Thanks. Come in.

59:29.522 --> 59:31.568
Oh! These are for you.

59:31.611 --> 59:33.700
Thank you.

59:35.223 --> 59:38.357
[giggles]
It's totally a date.

59:39.532 --> 59:40.794
So, what have we got here?

59:40.838 --> 59:43.928
We got some arugula, some figs

59:43.971 --> 59:45.799
and, uh..

59:45.843 --> 59:47.584
...chocolate chips.

59:47.627 --> 59:50.543
[Ally]
Yes, they are.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.023
Ally insisted
on making the salad.

59:52.066 --> 59:53.546
I see.

59:53.590 --> 59:56.157
Well..

59:56.201 --> 59:57.985
...it is delicious.

59:58.029 --> 59:59.291
So..

59:59.334 --> 01:00:02.642
...we have prepared
a list of questions.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.905
- For who? Me?
- You did?

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:06.951
Mm-hmm. Question number one.

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:09.214
Where did you grow up?

01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:10.694
Oh, this is relaxing.

01:00:10.737 --> 01:00:12.217
Arroyo Grande.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.349
Okay, my turn.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:16.743
Who taught you how to surf?

01:00:16.787 --> 01:00:18.615
- The VCR.
- Hm.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:19.833
What's that?

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:23.445
Proof that I'm a lot older
than you.

01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:25.447
Okay, next question.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:27.624
Oh, this one's mine.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.103
What do you like best
about our mom?

01:00:29.147 --> 01:00:31.758
Okay, no.
You don't have to answer that.

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.804
More salad?

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:35.414
What do I like best?

01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:37.808
First thing that comes to mind.

01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.723
- You don't have to answer that.
- That she..

01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:41.899
...is full of surprises.

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:45.642
[laughing]

01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:48.688
Could I have some more water?

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.125
Absolutely.

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:52.605
[laughing]

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.868
What're you laughing at?

01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:57.044
This salad is great,
by the way.

01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.350
Thank you.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:02.267
[cheering on TV]

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:17.891
So, what do we think?

01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:20.633
- It was awesome.
- It was awesome.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.636
[laughs]
How much did you pay them
to say that?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.465
You should feel proud.
It's really good.

01:01:30.904 --> 01:01:32.732
Here. The kids
got you something.

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:35.735
What? You guys are crazy.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.215
Open it.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.921
I don't know what to say.

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:49.140
It's for good luck.

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:51.925
Well, you could say
thank you.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.406
Now you have a tie
for your meeting.

01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:59.759
You didn't have to,
but thank you.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.022
Thank you very much.

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:07.071
Oh.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:10.770
Okay, you know what?
Uh, I gotta get going.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.859
He's not a big hugger.

01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:15.296
Yeah, I want to get up early
and get a..

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.777
...a good surf in before the
meeting. You know to de-stress.

01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:20.780
Yeah. You're gonna do great.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:22.695
Well, it's a big day
for everyone tomorrow.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.045
Nick has his swim trial.

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:27.613
Number we need for you
to make swim team at school?

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.093
One eighteen.

01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:32.705
- Vote for 118, remember?
- Of course I remember.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.402
So, you'll be there?

01:02:34.446 --> 01:02:36.665
I'm gonna try my hardest.

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:38.232
'Cause I always
do better when--

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:40.539
Okay, you know what?
I will, I will be there.

01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:42.410
I promise.

01:02:42.454 --> 01:02:44.064
Okay.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:46.110
And on that note,
goodnight.

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:49.766
Thank you so much for dinner,
the salad was delicious.

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:52.899
- I had a really nice time.
- Yeah, me too. Thank you.

01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:55.423
- Thanks for coming. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.295
[instrumental music]

01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:04.432
Stop looking at me like that.

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:05.912
[instrumental music]

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.715
[Tank barks]

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:28.543
I know what you're thinking.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:32.591
No, this does not mean
we're going to Disneyland.

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:43.515
Alright! Come eat!

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.914
I want you to get all your major
food groups in before your test.

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:53.394
You need to stop worrying, mom.
I'm ready.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:54.918
I know you are.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:57.877
I just want you to feel good.
Full of energy.

01:03:57.921 --> 01:04:00.358
- You look happy.
- I'm always happy, bud.

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:04.188
Yeah, but...you look
extra happy today.

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.147
Well, I finished my draft
last night, so..

01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:09.410
- I don't think that's it.
- No?

01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:11.935
- I think our neighbor--
- Okay, mister.

01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:13.806
No time for speculation. Eat.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.069
[Tank barking]

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:22.859
I'll be back soon, buddy.

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.297
[car door opens and shuts]

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.385
[Tank barking]

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:28.386
[engine cranking]

01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:33.739
Ally, breakfast!

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:35.523
[instrumental music]

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:42.182
[Kayla]
Alright, guys,
have fun out there.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.924
Alright, Nick, you're up next.

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:46.970
Let's see if you can beat
your personal best.

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:48.275
Have you seen Lucas?

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.538
Umm, I'm sure he's on his way.

01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:52.062
Light up.

01:04:53.802 --> 01:04:55.543
[indistinct chatter]

01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:06.032
So leave the promotional piece
as it is and just..

01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:07.294
...run it with it from there.

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:09.122
Hey, I am open to anything.

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.690
As long as the integrity
of the camp stays the same.

01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:13.866
Well, I think we need to
go out and celebrate.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.520
Start talking
expansion plans.

01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:17.435
[cell phone vibrating]

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.047
I'd love to, but I can't.

01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:23.310
You have a wife and kids
waiting for you?

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:25.791
- You know that's not the case.
- What then?

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.054
You've worked hard.

01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:31.014
You're right. I have.

01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:34.017
Ten years in the making.
I can't believe this is a go.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.584
Let's start planning.

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.283
[clears throat]

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.813
[cell phone vibrating]

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.119
[whistle blows]

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.643
[crowd cheering]

01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:56.953
Go, Nick. Go, Nick. Go..

01:05:57.823 --> 01:06:00.260
[crowd cheering]

01:06:04.308 --> 01:06:06.484
Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:10.488
[crowd cheering]

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:15.972
[instrumental music]

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:19.453
Hey, Nick.

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.238
There was a lot of drag
in the pool.

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:24.154
- I felt it.
- You don't need to say that.

01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:27.505
- You want a soda?
- I don't want anything.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:30.769
- Nice job, Grayson.
- Thanks, Mrs. T.

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:32.814
Hey. You did good, bud.

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:34.860
Real close.
You should feel proud.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:36.993
Can you stop saying that?

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.603
I just didn't want you
to beat yourself up.

01:06:38.646 --> 01:06:41.693
Then stop talking
about it, okay?

01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.695
Okay.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:49.701
I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened out there.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.051
It's not your fault.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.184
I'm surprised Lucas missed it.

01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:58.536
- Are you really?
- This time, yes.

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:17.207
[knock at door]

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:20.166
I've got it.

01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:28.218
[chuckles]
Hey, buddy.

01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:31.830
I'm sorry, I missed you earlier.

01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:33.353
That's fine.

01:07:33.397 --> 01:07:37.183
- Is your mom home?
- Yeah, I'll go get her.

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:47.063
I'm glad your meeting went well.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:48.194
Thank you.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:49.500
But you can't do that.

01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:51.110
Yes, you are absolutely right.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.546
I probably should've gotten
a dog sitter.

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.766
I didn't know how long
it was gonna take.

01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:57.725
This isn't about Tank.

01:07:57.769 --> 01:08:00.511
You can't make promises
to kids that you can't keep.

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:08.736
- I thought Nick had it.
- But he didn't.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.651
And that's my fault?

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:12.740
It threw him.

01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:19.051
See, now, this is why
I stay unattached.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.399
Responsibility?

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:22.924
Hey, it keeps things simple.

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:26.363
So, you just want to live
the bachelor lifestyle forever.

01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:28.015
Never get close to anyone.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.541
You're one to talk.

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:32.673
You literally built a wall
in your backyard

01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:34.761
because you're too afraid
to let people in.

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:36.808
You cannot write people off
like that.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:39.158
- This is not about me.
- Yeah, it kinda is.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:42.073
It's about Nick.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.554
He needed your support.

01:08:43.596 --> 01:08:46.904
He's not a boy anymore,
he's 11 years old.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:49.560
He can't rely on other people
to push him.

01:08:49.603 --> 01:08:51.388
He needs to learn
how to push himself.

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:54.086
You know what, I am not gonna
argue with you about this.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.568
- Fine.
- You can go, if you want.

01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:00.832
[instrumental music]

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:12.844
[sighs]

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:46.182
Hmm. Hmm, coffee.

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.147
Ally.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.149
Ally.
Honey, where's your brother?

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.237
Don't know.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:01.240
[sighs]
He's not in his bed.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:04.025
He promised he'd be back.

01:10:04.069 --> 01:10:05.984
Be back? From where?

01:10:08.639 --> 01:10:09.901
Lucas!

01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:13.034
Alright, alright,
it's too early for drama.

01:10:13.078 --> 01:10:15.559
What is Dorin's Cove?

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:21.217
I don't understand
why Nick would do this.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.131
He's never snuck out before.

01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:24.611
I'm sure he had his reasons.

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:27.397
I mean, how does he even know
about this place?

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:31.749
What?

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.926
- I brought him here.
- You what?

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:36.667
This part was really important
to me when I was a kid.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.929
I thought maybe it would help.

01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:39.365
How could this possibly--

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:40.888
I just wanted to give him
some encouragement.

01:10:40.932 --> 01:10:42.020
I can't believe you.

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:43.369
I can't believe
that you would do this.

01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:44.936
I'm sorry.

01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.808
[Jenna sighs]

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:50.681
[instrumental music]

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.561
There's his bike.

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:02.910
Well, then,
he's gotta be down there.

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:04.347
Stay here, sweetie.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:05.957
Okay.

01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:12.093
He'll be okay,
he's a strong swimmer.

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.573
[Jenna]
'Nick!'

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:15.619
- 'Nick!'
- Oh.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.100
That's my mom.

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:20.972
Nick. Nick.

01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:23.235
Are you okay?
Honey, are you okay?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.106
- Yeah.
- What were you thinking?

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:28.327
I thought I would get home
before you noticed.

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:29.633
Do you have any idea

01:11:29.676 --> 01:11:31.417
how many things are wrong
with that statement?

01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:33.941
- You don't get it.
- You're right, I don't.

01:11:33.985 --> 01:11:35.769
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that was?

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.118
I want you to go stand up there
next to your bike

01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:38.381
with your sister
and wait for me.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.208
We're gonna talk about this
on the walk home.

01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:41.993
Why can't we go back with Lucas?

01:11:42.036 --> 01:11:43.342
Sorry, bud.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:45.170
I got a few things
I need to take care of.

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:47.346
Like what?

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.522
I'm actually leaving tomorrow.

01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:53.396
I got to scout some locations
for camps.

01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:55.093
Go on. I'll meet you
up there in a minute.

01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:56.660
Alright.

01:11:58.009 --> 01:12:00.316
Look, this is my fault.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:02.187
I should've trusted my gut.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.580
What's that supposed to mean?

01:12:03.623 --> 01:12:05.233
Nothing.

01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:06.452
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:07.888
Really? It does.
I mean, look at you.

01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:10.108
No, I'm fine.

01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:11.762
Remember?

01:12:11.805 --> 01:12:13.372
You were right.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:16.332
Furry kids are the only kind
you should handle.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.510
[instrumental music]

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.470
[cricket chirping]

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:27.647
Do you really think
they'll like them?

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:30.824
Double fudge cupcakes
for the last day of camp?

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:32.696
Who wouldn't?

01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:34.132
Alright.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.352
You finish the sprinkles.

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:38.876
I'm gonna go talk
to your brother, alright?

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:45.883
[instrumental music]

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:54.326
Hey, can we talk?

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.806
Sure.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:03.074
So, you want to tell me
what happened this morning?

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:05.685
I told you,
I just wanted to surprise you.

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:08.949
By sneaking out?
That's not a good surprise.

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:11.430
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- I know.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:12.910
But you did.

01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:14.520
I.. I'm sorry.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.608
It's just..

01:13:15.652 --> 01:13:17.218
I wanted to do it then tell you

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:18.350
so you didn't have to worry.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.525
[sighs]

01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:21.875
Honey, that's the beauty
of being a mom.

01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:23.442
I'm always gonna worry
about you.

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:24.965
Both of you

01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:26.576
for the rest of my life.

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:30.318
I'm just trying to understand
what you did.

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:31.537
I had to prove I could.

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.757
To whom? Lucas?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.019
Myself.

01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:38.109
I don't want to be afraid
of failure anymore.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.939
I get it. I really do.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:45.464
How do you feel now?

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.902
Like, I did my best.
Like, maybe that's enough.

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:53.907
- Sounds stupid, right?
- No.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:56.214
But it does sound a lot like
somebody we both know.

01:13:56.257 --> 01:14:00.044
It's not his fault, mom.
Lucas didn't tell me to do it.

01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:01.567
[Jenna sighs]

01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:03.917
I'm sorry, bud,
but I don't wanna talk

01:14:03.961 --> 01:14:05.528
about our neighbor
anymore, okay?

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:07.181
But he leaves tomorrow.

01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:10.620
Well, then I guess we only have
one more day to get through.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:11.969
Come on, let's go get a cupcake

01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.232
before your sister
eats them all.

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.804
[birds chirping]

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:41.564
[sighs]

01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:48.919
Hey, mom, can we go outside
and play for a bit?

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:51.095
You need to get ready for camp.

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:54.185
But...we already are.

01:14:55.055 --> 01:14:56.840
Oh. Oh.

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:59.103
I'm proud of you both
for getting yourselves ready

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:01.148
but, no, not today.

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:03.194
Pancakes are almost ready.

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:11.071
So quiet, buddy.
You gonna talk to me?

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.030
[whimpering]

01:15:13.073 --> 01:15:14.771
[sighs]

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:17.861
What you thinkin'?

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.733
It's gonna be alright.

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:23.214
Change of scenery
will do us good.

01:15:26.173 --> 01:15:28.741
So, we've got absolutely
no agenda today.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:31.614
I want you to go out there
and play hard.

01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:32.658
Yes, Ally?

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.094
Since it's the last day

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:35.835
can we get half off
in the end?

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:37.663
Yes.

01:15:38.272 --> 01:15:40.536
[all scream]

01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:55.594
We could, um, caravan
or get lunch or talk?

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.422
Alright, stop.

01:15:57.465 --> 01:15:59.816
Okay, you need to vent
or talk plans

01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:01.208
or do something normally

01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:02.253
'cause you're freaking me out

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:03.254
with all this silence.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:04.385
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:07.867
Don't be sorry,
just talk to me.

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.043
I don't know what to say.

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.915
It's okay
to feel disappointed.

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:14.918
- I liked him too.
- It's not about Lucas.

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:17.747
No? Then what is this about?

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:21.315
Maybe you should just
talk to him.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:22.926
It might make you feel better.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:25.450
I think we've already said
way too much.

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:29.149
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's better this way.

01:16:29.193 --> 01:16:31.108
It's certainly safer.

01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:35.591
Do you mind
if we pick up the pace a little?

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.157
I just want to keep moving.

01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:38.202
Sure.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:44.034
[instrumental music]

01:16:45.513 --> 01:16:47.211
[Jenna]
The car is already filled
to the brim.

01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:50.301
I mean, I don't understand
where all this stuff came from?

01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:52.346
I'm sure
we didn't bring this much.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.740
Well, I'm almost done
with my stuff.

01:16:54.784 --> 01:16:56.960
Ally, not so much.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.052
What did I do now?

01:17:02.095 --> 01:17:03.401
Nothin'.

01:17:05.882 --> 01:17:08.711
You just look so grown up.

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.756
Even in these last five weeks.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.063
Are you seriously crying
right now?

01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:14.804
What? No.

01:17:14.847 --> 01:17:18.111
I just have
overactive tear ducts.

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:19.286
Right.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:23.595
You do look grown up though.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.728
Yeah, I've kinda learned
a lot this summer.

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:27.599
Yeah? Like what?

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.645
Like, chocolate doesn't go
with everything.

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:30.776
Very true.

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.517
Bunk beds
are super uncomfortable.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.953
Oh, I totally agree.

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:35.651
And..

01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:38.958
And?

01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:42.832
You miss one hundred percent
of the shots you never take.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:46.357
- Who told you that?
- Lucas.

01:17:48.098 --> 01:17:51.797
See, this was a very grown up
conversation.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:54.017
Go finish packing.

01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:57.847
[instrumental music]

01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:12.688
[Jenna]
'Nick.'

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:16.343
I think I need to talk to him.

01:18:16.387 --> 01:18:18.824
- You do?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:22.045
Then go. Like, now.

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:28.051
[engine cranking]

01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:32.795
Lucas! Lucas, wait!

01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:34.274
Stop!

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:35.754
Lucas! Stop!

01:18:35.798 --> 01:18:37.321
Come on.

01:18:38.409 --> 01:18:40.150
I was like two feet away.

01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:44.241
You talking to yourself
down there?

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:47.548
'Cause if you are we might need
to find you some more friends.

01:18:47.592 --> 01:18:50.508
[chuckles]
You're still here.

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:52.510
Yeah.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:55.426
There was a...change of plans.

01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:58.429
Good.
I mean, hi.

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:02.172
This is good, because..

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.870
[exhales]

01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:09.179
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:10.528
You did?

01:19:11.703 --> 01:19:13.183
For lashing out.

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:17.970
You've been amazing
with my kids all summer.

01:19:18.014 --> 01:19:22.235
Okay, maybe not when we first
got here, but mostly amazing..

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:24.107
Thank you.

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:25.630
I think.

01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:27.197
I was wrong about you.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.938
[Lucas]
You were?

01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:30.940
Maybe I wanted to be right.

01:19:30.983 --> 01:19:33.377
But you were just kind of..

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.944
Great?

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.599
Kinda.

01:19:38.643 --> 01:19:42.473
So, you don't think that
I'm a stubborn, messy surfer

01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:44.170
who's totally distracted?

01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:48.305
Oh, you're
absolutely stubborn, and..

01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:51.525
Wait.

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:52.962
How are you quoting..

01:19:53.005 --> 01:19:56.400
The message that you left
at the rental agency.

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.752
You're L.M. Management.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.842
And you own the duplex.

01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:05.844
Hey, summer camp
isn't a year round gig.

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:08.368
I need to diversify.

01:20:08.412 --> 01:20:09.761
[sighs]

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.329
I'm really glad that you stayed.

01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:18.291
I didn't mean
all those things I said.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.339
Maybe I did
when I first said it, but..

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.472
...I was wrong.

01:20:25.516 --> 01:20:27.431
I was too.

01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.302
You were?

01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:31.348
I was wrong to think
that I could stay unattached

01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:33.132
to the three of you.

01:20:34.525 --> 01:20:37.267
Why do you think
I'm still hanging around here?

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:40.096
You got me.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.012
What about your trip?

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.056
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.015
I'll catch up.

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:49.366
I just couldn't miss you.

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:53.283
I love you.

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.723
- Are you crying?
- No.

01:20:58.766 --> 01:20:59.898
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:01.378
Come here.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.858
I'm not crying.

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.207
[Lucas]
I know.

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:07.732
What are we gonna do?

01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:10.517
About all this?

01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:11.954
About us.

01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:13.869
Well..

01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:17.481
First, I think
we need to set some..

01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:18.830
...new rules.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.005
You know, guidelines.

01:21:20.049 --> 01:21:22.355
Oh. And what would those
guidelines

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:23.704
look like exactly?

01:21:23.748 --> 01:21:25.924
Rule number one,
I definitely get to kiss you.

01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:28.753
- Like, right now?
- Preferably.

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:30.886
I'm willing to agree to that.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:35.020
[instrumental music]

01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:45.291
Now, I got one more rule

01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:47.511
that needs to be addressed.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:51.776
[Ally]
So, there are no sides anymore?

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:53.647
[Lucas]
You are free to roam.

01:21:53.691 --> 01:21:56.172
Does that mean Tank
can come over whenever he wants?

01:21:56.215 --> 01:21:58.609
Only if I can come over
with him.

01:22:01.829 --> 01:22:03.048
Hey, bud..

01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:05.137
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.705
- That was my bad.
- That's okay.

01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:10.186
No, it isn't, but, uh..

01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:12.057
I promise to make it up to you.

01:22:12.101 --> 01:22:14.190
- I'd like that.
- Yeah?

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:15.452
Yeah.

01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:20.631
You realize
we're hugging, right?

01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:23.547
Yup.

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:25.636
And we're good.

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:31.642
Alright, throw it in.

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:36.081
[laughing]

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.475
[Nick]
I'll beat you.

01:22:41.304 --> 01:22:43.393
- Nicky.
- I beat you.

01:22:47.266 --> 01:22:49.051
- Come on, Tank.
- Come here, boy. Come here.

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.922
I don't want this summer to end.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.272
Doesn't have to.

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:55.971
Yeah, it kinda does.
We have to move back tomorrow.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:59.365
What if your rental agent said
you could stay longer?

01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:02.064
[chuckles]
That's sweet,
but logistically..

01:23:02.107 --> 01:23:04.327
We will make a plan.

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.938
You really think
we can make this work?

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:10.681
We made the last five weeks
work, we can make this work.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.772
Now, I have
one more question for you.

01:23:14.815 --> 01:23:16.078
Okay.

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.776
Can we go back
to rule number one?

01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:20.343
Yes, please.

01:23:22.867 --> 01:23:24.695
