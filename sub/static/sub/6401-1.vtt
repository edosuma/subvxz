- Thank you

03:46.935 --> 03:48.644
l’m leaving now

03:50.271 --> 03:53.732
You don't need to see us off
if you're busy at school

03:53.858 --> 03:57.277
It’s fine, I have plenty of time

See you later

04:20.969 --> 04:22.803
Bye!

04:39.570 --> 04:42.572
Have you got the air cushion?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.325
Didn't I give it to you?

04:46.077 --> 04:47.995
It’s not here

04:48.121 --> 04:52.124
- l’m sure I gave it to you
- Did you?

04:55.586 --> 04:57.671
Good morning!

04:57.797 --> 04:59.298
Morning

04:59.424 --> 05:02.718
- Off to Tokyo today?
- Yes, the train's this afternoon

05:02.844 --> 05:08.015
- I see...
- We're going to see all our children

05:08.725 --> 05:13.353
They must be looking forward
to your visit

05:13.479 --> 05:17.399
You'll keep an eye on the house
for us, won't you?

05:17.525 --> 05:19.735
Of course. You enjoy yourselves

05:19.861 --> 05:25.699
You're lucky you've got such
fine sons and daughters

05:25.825 --> 05:28.493
Well, we'll see how we fare

05:28.619 --> 05:33.540
- And it's a lovely day, too
- We're very lucky

05:33.666 --> 05:37.919
- Well, I wish you both a safe trip
- Thank you

05:44.135 --> 05:48.764
- I still can't find that air cushion
- It must be there. Have another look

05:51.893 --> 05:55.103
- Oh, here it is
- Found it?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.980
Got it

06:27.261 --> 06:30.389
Doctor Hirayama
Paediatrician

07:38.499 --> 07:40.876
Don't make the place untidy, Isamu

07:57.852 --> 07:59.478
l’m back!

07:59.604 --> 08:01.313
Welcome home!

08:05.818 --> 08:07.986
Hi. Have grandpa and grandma
arrived?

08:08.112 --> 08:10.071
They'll be here very soon

08:31.552 --> 08:38.225
Mum!

08:39.684 --> 08:42.729
- What is it?
- Why have you moved my desk?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.898
To make room
for grandpa and grandma

08:45.024 --> 08:47.442
You don't have to move my desk,
do you?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.945
They need the space to sleep in

08:50.071 --> 08:53.406
Where am I supposed to study
for my exams?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.825
You can study wherever you like

09:04.252 --> 09:07.671
But Mum... where do I do my homework?

09:10.591 --> 09:13.802
- Where, Mum?
- Just pipe down

09:13.928 --> 09:17.138
- You never usually want to study
- Yes, I do!

09:17.265 --> 09:19.641
You do not!

09:19.767 --> 09:22.519
So I don't have to do
any homework, then?

09:22.645 --> 09:26.356
- Well, that suits me just fine!
- Quiet, Minoru!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.734
They're here

09:36.742 --> 09:38.285
Welcome home, dear

09:38.411 --> 09:40.579
Come on in

09:40.705 --> 09:43.790
- Welcome
- Come in

09:50.798 --> 09:52.716
Come in

09:55.970 --> 09:58.013
There you go

10:09.317 --> 10:12.777
You must be tired, Mother.
Did you sleep on the train?

10:12.903 --> 10:14.779
Yes, very well

10:15.823 --> 10:17.741
Come and sit here

10:23.581 --> 10:25.665
Welcome to you both

10:26.834 --> 10:29.461
It’s been a while
since we last saw you

10:30.671 --> 10:33.965
Many thanks for having us to stay

10:36.010 --> 10:39.888
- It’s been ages, Mother
- It has indeed

10:40.014 --> 10:41.931
It’s lovely to see you

10:42.058 --> 10:46.227
- Is our sister Kyoko well?
- Very well, thank you

10:46.354 --> 10:49.064
- She's looking after the house?
- Yes

10:53.736 --> 10:56.488
Oh, wait, Fumiko

10:56.614 --> 10:59.824
I brought you a little something

10:59.950 --> 11:03.536
Just some rice crackers.
They're quite tasty

11:03.663 --> 11:06.956
- Thank you so much
- Mother's fond of them

11:07.083 --> 11:08.833
Shall I serve them?

11:09.835 --> 11:12.504
Any bowl will do

11:12.630 --> 11:15.382
- How about this?
- Perfect, perfect

11:18.719 --> 11:20.762
Did Noriko go to the station?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.682
No, she didn't.
I told her when they were arriving

11:23.808 --> 11:27.018
- I wonder what happened?
- Serve these, will you?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.108
Minoru? Isamu?
What are you up to?

11:33.234 --> 11:35.026
Come with me

11:43.077 --> 11:45.286
Grandpa, grandma...

11:47.123 --> 11:49.290
You've both grown

11:49.417 --> 11:53.420
- Minoru's at primary school now
- I see

11:53.546 --> 11:56.631
- And how old are you, Isamu?
- How old are you?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.341
How old?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.142
The bath's ready for you
whenever you like

12:07.268 --> 12:09.894
- Would you like a bath, Father?
- All right...

12:10.020 --> 12:12.313
- Would you like to change, Mother?
- l’ll get you a light kimono...

12:12.440 --> 12:14.107
l’m fine, Fumiko

12:14.233 --> 12:16.276
l’ll get in the bath

12:18.612 --> 12:20.029
l’ll take that

12:20.156 --> 12:21.740
This way

12:37.131 --> 12:39.174
Did Keizo meet you at Osaka?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.844
Yes, I sent him a telegram
and he met us

12:42.970 --> 12:44.971
- Is he well?
- Yes

12:45.097 --> 12:47.182
He sent a present for you

12:47.308 --> 12:49.559
It’s all right, Mother, give it to me later

12:49.685 --> 12:52.479
- Have you got a towel, Father?
- Yes, yes

12:52.605 --> 12:54.272
Take your time

12:56.692 --> 13:00.236
- What shall we feed them?
- I don't know...

13:00.362 --> 13:03.364
- Hey, brother?
- What?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.576
Meat's all right for supper, isn't it?
Sukiyaki?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.411
Yeah, fine

13:08.537 --> 13:10.330
And maybe some sashimi?

13:11.832 --> 13:14.209
The meat'll be enough

13:14.335 --> 13:16.336
There's plenty to go round

13:18.005 --> 13:21.007
- Hello?
- Here's Noriko. Come in!

13:24.887 --> 13:27.180
- Welcome
- I was too late!

13:27.306 --> 13:31.100
- Did you go to Tokyo Station?
- By the time I got there, they'd gone

13:31.227 --> 13:33.770
- For you
- Oh, thank you

13:37.316 --> 13:38.983
- Oh, come in
- Welcome

13:39.109 --> 13:42.070
- Sorry l’m so late
- They're upstairs

13:42.196 --> 13:45.532
All right, l’ll go and say hello

13:52.998 --> 13:54.999
Welcome to you both

13:57.127 --> 14:00.922
- It’s been a while, Noriko
- It’s lovely to see you

14:03.050 --> 14:04.968
Were you very busy?

14:06.053 --> 14:12.475
Not really, but by the time I'd finished,
it was too late

14:12.601 --> 14:18.857
Oh, you needn't have rushed round here.
We could've met tomorrow

14:20.067 --> 14:22.569
Still working for the same company?

14:27.241 --> 14:31.786
- It must be hard, supporting yourself
- Not at all

14:31.912 --> 14:35.248
- Your bath's ready, Father!
- Coming!

14:47.761 --> 14:51.222
- l’ll do that for you, Mother
- l’m fine

14:52.516 --> 14:56.102
Being in Tokyo is like a dream

14:58.606 --> 15:03.151
I always thought Tokyo
was so far away...

15:03.277 --> 15:08.907
...but it was only yesterday we were
in Onomichi, and now we're with you

15:11.911 --> 15:15.413
l’m glad l’m alive to see
so many changes

15:16.290 --> 15:19.709
But the two of you
haven't changed at all

15:20.294 --> 15:25.423
Of course we have,
we're a couple of old folks now

15:26.634 --> 15:28.134
Mother?

15:30.054 --> 15:33.848
What are you two talking about?
Let's go downstairs

15:36.727 --> 15:40.355
Mother, l’m sure you're getting taller

15:41.148 --> 15:43.942
How could I have grown?

15:44.068 --> 15:46.986
It’s true, you have.
And you've put on weight

15:48.155 --> 15:51.532
When I was a child,
she was so big...

15:51.659 --> 15:55.453
...I used to feel ashamed
in front of my classmates

15:55.579 --> 15:58.456
- Once, she broke a school chair
- Don't tell lies!

15:58.582 --> 16:00.667
That chair was already broken

16:00.793 --> 16:04.212
- You still believe that?
- Of course!

16:04.338 --> 16:06.506
Never mind. Let's go down

17:05.441 --> 17:07.942
- Shall I take this through, Sister?
- Yes, do

17:14.199 --> 17:16.576
- And this?
- Just leave it out

17:31.258 --> 17:33.760
It’s a little cooler now

17:34.595 --> 17:39.474
- It must be hot in Onomichi
- It is indeed

17:39.600 --> 17:42.435
Mother, how is O-Ko?

17:43.562 --> 17:48.316
She must've been born
under an unlucky star

17:48.442 --> 17:53.780
When she was widowed,
she married again last spring...

17:53.906 --> 17:57.408
...and took her child with her
to Kurashiki

17:58.285 --> 18:02.163
But I hear the poor woman's
not very happy

18:02.289 --> 18:03.790
Really?

18:04.833 --> 18:10.171
What was the name of that fellow
on the council staff?

18:10.297 --> 18:14.008
Oh, Mihashi, you mean?
He passed away

18:14.134 --> 18:18.304
- Quite some time ago, wasn't it?
- That's right

18:19.264 --> 18:22.058
Do you remember Hattori?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.268
In the military section?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.978
I remember him

18:27.147 --> 18:31.192
- He's living in Tokyo now
- Is that right?

18:31.318 --> 18:35.404
- I intend to go round and visit him
- Where is he?

18:35.531 --> 18:39.367
Somewhere in the Daito district.
I have his address

18:39.493 --> 18:40.993
Right...

18:42.079 --> 18:45.706
Have you tidied everything up?
Thanks so much

18:45.833 --> 18:49.418
Noriko, here's your present
from Keizo

18:49.545 --> 18:51.212
Oh, thank you

18:52.256 --> 18:54.215
Thank you

18:54.341 --> 18:58.928
- Oh, sorry, Grandma...
- Not at all, Fumiko, not at all

18:59.888 --> 19:02.557
You're going out tomorrow, aren't you?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.226
It’s Sunday,
so I can show them around

19:05.352 --> 19:10.523
- Right. Shall we be off then, Noriko?
- Let's leave together

19:10.649 --> 19:12.441
- Thank you
- Thank you

19:12.568 --> 19:15.611
- Thank you for coming
- Thanks for dinner, Brother

19:15.737 --> 19:18.114
- Sorry it's so late
- l’ll see you soon, Father

19:18.240 --> 19:21.033
- Thanks
- Thanks

19:22.703 --> 19:24.912
We'll be fine, Fumiko

19:38.218 --> 19:40.887
- Thanks for having us so late
- Thank you for supper

19:41.013 --> 19:42.471
Thank you for coming

19:53.775 --> 19:56.319
You must be tired, Father

19:58.030 --> 20:00.281
Do you want to go to bed, Mother?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.618
Shall we retire, then?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.206
- Night, then
- Goodnight

20:15.130 --> 20:17.298
- Night
- Goodnight

20:18.508 --> 20:21.219
- Goodnight
- Night

20:21.345 --> 20:23.512
l’ll bring you some water

20:48.997 --> 20:52.750
- You must be tired
- Not really

20:57.381 --> 20:59.674
l’m glad they're all well

21:02.803 --> 21:04.971
We're here at last

21:08.058 --> 21:11.477
What part of Tokyo is this?

21:12.771 --> 21:16.357
- The suburbs
- I guess so

21:17.234 --> 21:21.320
It was a long ride from the station

21:23.240 --> 21:27.118
I thought they'd live
somewhere more central

21:27.244 --> 21:29.996
- Than here?
- Yes

21:31.248 --> 21:35.209
Koichi did want to move more centrally

21:37.170 --> 21:39.213
But it's not easy

22:05.949 --> 22:09.118
Urara Beauty Salon

22:28.680 --> 22:31.932
How long are your mother
and father staying?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.643
Four or five days. Pass me that

22:36.646 --> 22:41.901
- Shouldn't I call round to see them?
- Don't bother. They'll come here

22:43.862 --> 22:47.865
I should take them to a show
or something

22:47.991 --> 22:51.327
You needn't bother
worrying about them

22:55.791 --> 22:57.958
They're delicious, these beans

23:00.504 --> 23:03.589
What are their plans for today?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.427
Don't eat all those beans

23:10.263 --> 23:12.640
My brother's taking them sightseeing

23:12.766 --> 23:16.310
So I needn't bother, then

23:16.436 --> 23:19.021
Kiyo, come and get some food

23:22.484 --> 23:26.487
Behave yourselves today
when you're with grandpa and grandma

23:26.613 --> 23:28.906
- You hear me?
- Yes

23:29.032 --> 23:30.533
Sit down

23:31.576 --> 23:34.161
- How much longer?
- They'll be ready soon

23:34.287 --> 23:37.790
Go upstairs and
ask if they're ready to go

23:47.217 --> 23:49.260
- Are you ready?
- Ready

23:49.386 --> 23:52.721
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Let's go, then

23:58.854 --> 24:00.771
They're coming

24:05.819 --> 24:07.236
What about lunch?

24:07.362 --> 24:11.115
We'll go to a restaurant
in a department store

24:11.241 --> 24:13.701
- The children will like that
- Fine

24:13.827 --> 24:17.788
- Isamu loves those kiddy lunches
- All right

24:31.219 --> 24:33.345
Excuse me...

24:35.056 --> 24:38.767
- How is he?
- No better

24:40.020 --> 24:46.108
- Any appetite?
- He'll only take a cold drink

24:46.234 --> 24:51.322
- Has his temperature fallen?
- His temperature is still 102

24:51.448 --> 24:53.449
I see. I'd better see him

24:53.575 --> 24:56.869
Thank you, l’m sorry to spoil your day

25:06.922 --> 25:09.882
Are the hypodermics sterilised?
I must visit a patient

25:10.008 --> 25:11.467
Really?

25:13.470 --> 25:20.142
Father, l’m afraid
I have to visit a patient

25:20.268 --> 25:21.727
- I see
- Sorry

25:21.853 --> 25:26.941
- Never mind
- It could take a while

25:27.067 --> 25:29.026
That's all right

25:29.152 --> 25:32.863
- l’ll see you later
- Take care

25:34.741 --> 25:37.576
- Still not ready?
- No...

25:44.459 --> 25:49.129
- I may be late
- What about your mother and father?

25:49.256 --> 25:51.715
Shall I take them?

25:51.841 --> 25:57.388
You can't leave the house unoccupied.
We'll go next Sunday

25:57.514 --> 26:00.474
Very well. See you later

26:07.524 --> 26:10.276
- Where's dad going?
- To see a patient

26:16.283 --> 26:18.826
l’m awfully sorry

26:18.952 --> 26:21.787
Never mind.
A busy doctor's a good doctor

26:21.913 --> 26:24.373
He's very dedicated

26:24.499 --> 26:28.210
Aren't we going, Mum? It’s not fair!

26:28.336 --> 26:31.171
It can't be helped. A patient needs him

26:31.298 --> 26:33.340
Not fair!

26:33.466 --> 26:36.510
- You can go another time
- Not fair!

26:36.636 --> 26:38.679
Behave yourself, Minoru!

26:38.805 --> 26:41.807
- You lied!
- Make yourself scarce!

26:45.145 --> 26:47.479
- Come here
- No way!

26:48.607 --> 26:53.193
- They're so naughty
- It’s good for boys to be spirited

27:03.997 --> 27:07.041
Now just behave yourselves

27:07.167 --> 27:08.834
It’s not fair!

27:10.795 --> 27:12.504
You can go another time

27:12.631 --> 27:16.216
It’s always "another time".
We never go!

27:16.343 --> 27:18.719
It can't be helped
that dad had to go out

27:18.845 --> 27:23.599
- As usual!
- Now don't be so difficult

27:23.725 --> 27:26.018
- It’s not fair!
- Not fair!

27:27.062 --> 27:30.397
- Not fair!
- What? You're being horrible

27:30.523 --> 27:33.651
- Behave, or l’ll tell your father
- Go and tell him!

27:33.777 --> 27:39.198
- You just remember those words!
- See if I care!

27:41.493 --> 27:44.662
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing...

27:44.788 --> 27:48.832
Come along, Isamu,
come for a walk with granny

27:48.958 --> 27:51.627
- Won't you come, too, Minoru?
- Minoru...

27:52.796 --> 27:56.632
- Come on, then
- That'll be nice with granny, Isamu

27:56.758 --> 27:58.884
Let's go

27:59.010 --> 28:02.388
Sure you don't want to come, Minoru?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.892
Thank you

28:08.395 --> 28:11.397
Minoru, go with them

28:11.523 --> 28:14.233
- Shan't!
- Suit yourself then

28:19.406 --> 28:21.615
See you later

28:50.270 --> 28:52.312
Here you are

28:54.816 --> 28:56.734
Thank you

28:58.778 --> 29:03.449
- What's up with Minoru?
- He's just so stubborn

29:03.575 --> 29:06.201
His father was the same

29:06.327 --> 29:11.123
Koichi always had to have his own way

29:11.249 --> 29:14.418
It’s just a shame he had to go out
when you're here

29:14.544 --> 29:16.920
Oh, we're fine

29:17.046 --> 29:19.548
We'll go next Sunday

29:19.674 --> 29:21.592
Thank you

29:21.718 --> 29:26.972
After a few days here,
we're thinking of visiting Shige

29:32.854 --> 29:36.064
There they are

30:01.591 --> 30:05.886
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Isamu?

30:12.018 --> 30:16.021
Do you want to be a doctor
like your daddy?

30:16.147 --> 30:22.361
By the time you're a doctor,
I wonder where l’ll be?

31:20.253 --> 31:22.296
Welcome back

31:24.007 --> 31:25.424
Hello

31:26.509 --> 31:28.635
- There was a call for you
- Who from?

31:28.761 --> 31:33.098
- Enomoto phoned about that business
- That's all wrapped up

31:37.103 --> 31:40.814
- What are your folks up to?
- They're upstairs

31:42.066 --> 31:45.110
I bought some sweets for them
from a place in Asakusa

31:48.781 --> 31:51.450
Try one, they're delicious

31:53.328 --> 31:56.788
These are expensive.
They don't expect such things

32:03.004 --> 32:05.130
Tasty, eh?

32:05.256 --> 32:08.342
Yes, but such things
are wasted on them

32:08.468 --> 32:10.427
Rice crackers would've done

32:10.553 --> 32:12.763
But they had rice crackers yesterday

32:12.889 --> 32:15.724
Yes, but they really like them

32:19.479 --> 32:23.023
Will you take them out somewhere
tomorrow?

32:23.149 --> 32:26.735
Tomorrow? l’m afraid I can't

32:26.861 --> 32:29.988
- I have to collect some accounts
- Really?

32:32.283 --> 32:35.160
I was hoping my brother
would do something with them

32:35.286 --> 32:39.164
- How about taking them to a film?
- What's on?

32:39.290 --> 32:43.877
- There's plenty on in the evenings
- Do that with them, then

32:44.003 --> 32:46.046
They've seen nothing of Tokyo yet

32:46.172 --> 32:48.757
It'd be a shame for them
not to get out

32:48.883 --> 32:52.886
I know, but who has the time
to take them?

33:41.019 --> 33:44.062
- You look busy
- Oh, you're back

33:44.188 --> 33:46.982
- Here
- Oh, thank you

33:49.610 --> 33:53.447
- What a job you've been asked to do!
- Not at all

33:53.573 --> 33:56.116
- Where's father?
- Putting clothes out to dry

33:56.242 --> 33:58.910
I see. Let's go to the bathhouse

34:06.210 --> 34:08.587
Father? Father!

34:12.592 --> 34:15.427
Let's go to the bathhouse

34:32.904 --> 34:34.862
Welcome home

34:34.989 --> 34:37.157
Let's go to the bathhouse

34:37.283 --> 34:41.786
- And we can buy ice-cream afterwards
- Oh, thank you

34:44.665 --> 34:46.625
Right, let's go

35:04.811 --> 35:07.145
- We're off to the bathhouse
- All right

35:08.648 --> 35:11.191
- See you later
- Bye

35:11.317 --> 35:12.859
See you later

35:12.985 --> 35:15.862
Mother, you can use my old sandals

35:16.823 --> 35:19.116
Really? Thanks

35:30.837 --> 35:32.003
Here

35:44.976 --> 35:47.644
Hello? Is that Yoneyama & Co?

35:47.770 --> 35:51.106
May I speak to Noriko Hirayama?
Thank you

35:56.320 --> 35:59.197
Ah, Noriko? It’s me

35:59.323 --> 36:01.116
Don't mention it

36:02.285 --> 36:05.120
Listen, I need a favour

36:05.246 --> 36:08.790
Can you spare any time tomorrow?

36:08.916 --> 36:13.753
Father and mother haven't
been sightseeing yet in Tokyo

36:14.714 --> 36:19.384
I was wondering if you could
take them out somewhere tomorrow

36:20.511 --> 36:26.808
I know. I ought to take them really,
but l’m too busy at the shop

36:26.934 --> 36:29.936
I know, l’m sorry

36:30.062 --> 36:31.897
Eh? Really?

36:33.065 --> 36:35.400
- Thank you
- Not at all

36:35.526 --> 36:39.404
Wait a moment, l’ll have to see

36:45.578 --> 36:49.247
- l’m sorry it's such short notice...
- What is it?

36:49.373 --> 36:51.958
- May I have tomorrow off?
- All right

36:52.084 --> 36:54.294
- Thank you
- What about the aluminium contract?

36:54.420 --> 36:56.421
l’ll get it finished today

37:00.718 --> 37:03.470
Hello? Sorry to keep you waiting

37:03.596 --> 37:06.473
l’ll call for them at 9:00
tomorrow morning

37:06.599 --> 37:07.933
Not at all

37:08.059 --> 37:11.269
Give my best regards
to your mother and father

37:11.395 --> 37:13.230
Till tomorrow, then

37:20.196 --> 37:23.657
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Tokyo

37:23.783 --> 37:30.121
Let's trace the illustrious history
of this great city

37:33.251 --> 37:36.294
On your right, the Imperial Palace,
formerly Chiyoda Castle

37:36.420 --> 37:41.508
Built 500 years ago
by Lord Dokan Ota...

37:41.634 --> 37:46.137
...its tranquil setting amid
green pine trees and a large moat...

37:46.264 --> 37:50.892
...contrasts strongly
with the bustle of modern Tokyo

38:47.158 --> 38:50.869
- Koichi's house is in that direction
- I see...

38:51.871 --> 38:57.667
- And Shige's house?
- Her house is that way, I think

38:59.628 --> 39:03.298
- And yours?
- My house is in that direction

39:09.972 --> 39:12.766
- It’s over that way
- I see

39:12.892 --> 39:17.562
I hope you'll come home with me later

39:46.801 --> 39:49.052
Who is it?

39:49.178 --> 39:52.263
- Only me
- You're home early today

39:52.390 --> 39:55.475
- Is Miko sleeping?
- She's just settled down

39:55.601 --> 39:59.187
- You don't have any sake, do you?
- Sake?

40:00.564 --> 40:04.567
- My in-laws are here
- I think I might have some

40:08.280 --> 40:12.742
- This is all l’ve got. Is this enough?
- Fine. Thanks

40:24.422 --> 40:27.132
Where did he have this photo taken?

40:28.134 --> 40:30.885
In Kamakura. A friend took it

40:31.011 --> 40:33.012
- I see
- When was that?

40:33.139 --> 40:36.766
- The year before he was conscripted
- Really...

40:38.310 --> 40:40.562
That's his typical look

40:41.522 --> 40:43.481
Head on one side

40:43.607 --> 40:46.151
He always stood like that

40:56.662 --> 40:59.038
- What is it?
- May I borrow a flask?

40:59.165 --> 41:00.832
Oh, right

41:05.004 --> 41:10.758
There you go. Do you want these, too?
They're delicious

41:10.885 --> 41:12.969
Thank you

41:13.095 --> 41:14.888
Sorry to bother you

41:25.858 --> 41:29.569
Noriko, please don't go to any trouble

41:29.695 --> 41:32.363
It’s fine, it's no trouble

41:34.867 --> 41:38.328
Thank you so much for today

41:38.454 --> 41:42.874
Not at all.
You both must be exhausted

41:43.000 --> 41:47.504
No, we've seen so many places,
thanks to you

42:00.100 --> 42:04.562
l’m sorry you had to put up with us
all day

42:04.688 --> 42:07.106
Of course not

42:07.233 --> 42:11.528
- You must be busy at work, though
- Not really

42:11.654 --> 42:16.574
We're only a small company and
not that busy, so I can take time off

42:16.700 --> 42:19.077
Well, that's lucky for us

42:33.425 --> 42:34.926
Please...

42:35.970 --> 42:37.637
All right...

42:39.473 --> 42:42.350
And on an empty stomach, too...

42:48.315 --> 42:50.984
This is good stuff

42:51.777 --> 42:54.153
Do you like a drop of sake, Father?

42:54.280 --> 42:57.824
Oh, yes,
very much so in the old days

42:57.950 --> 43:01.953
If we ever ran out at home...

43:02.079 --> 43:04.998
...he'd rush out for more,
any time of the night

43:06.292 --> 43:09.168
Every time we had a son...

43:09.295 --> 43:13.798
...I'd pray he wouldn't
become a drinker

43:15.134 --> 43:16.759
Did Shoji drink?

43:18.470 --> 43:22.724
- He did indeed
- Is that so?

43:23.809 --> 43:26.644
Often, when he went out drinking
after work...

43:26.770 --> 43:31.024
...he'd bring friends home because
they'd missed their last trains

43:31.150 --> 43:36.279
- Really?
- So you had the sort of trouble I had

43:36.405 --> 43:42.619
Yes... but now
it's a very dear memory

43:42.745 --> 43:44.454
How true

43:45.414 --> 43:47.707
Poor Shoji,
he lived so far away...

43:47.833 --> 43:50.793
...I feel he's still alive somewhere

43:51.837 --> 43:55.798
Father often tells me
not to be so foolish

43:55.924 --> 44:01.012
He must be dead. It’s been
eight years since the end of the war

44:01.138 --> 44:03.181
I know, but all the same...

44:04.391 --> 44:07.894
He was so wilful as a boy

44:08.020 --> 44:10.355
l’m sure he gave you
plenty of trouble, too

44:11.398 --> 44:12.857
Not really...

44:14.360 --> 44:18.863
Then he had to die. Poor Noriko

44:22.493 --> 44:23.618
Yes?

44:28.040 --> 44:30.375
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Thank you

44:33.629 --> 44:35.463
It’s not much, but...

44:39.176 --> 44:42.178
- There you are, Mother
- Thanks

44:42.304 --> 44:47.809
- Help yourself
- Very well. Thank you so much

45:24.430 --> 45:27.724
- They're late
- They'll be back soon

45:33.105 --> 45:36.107
How long are they planning
to stay in Tokyo?

45:40.279 --> 45:43.030
- They said nothing to you?
- No...

45:46.452 --> 45:48.244
Listen, Brother...

45:49.913 --> 45:54.333
...I was thinking, are you willing
to put up 3,000 yen?

45:54.460 --> 45:57.837
- What for?
- I will if you will

45:57.963 --> 46:00.047
2,000 yen should suffice

46:00.716 --> 46:03.676
- No, we'll need 3,000 yen
- What for?

46:03.802 --> 46:07.972
I was thinking we could send them
to a hot springs

46:09.349 --> 46:14.145
You and I are too busy
to shepherd them around

46:15.314 --> 46:18.149
And we can't keep asking Noriko

46:18.275 --> 46:21.861
- What do you think?
- Not a bad idea...

46:21.987 --> 46:26.908
I know a nice hotel in Atami,
not expensive at all

46:28.702 --> 46:34.499
- Sounds good. Let's send them there
- l’m sure they'll be pleased

46:34.625 --> 46:36.292
Good...

46:37.294 --> 46:42.882
I was worrying about the cost of taking
them around. But 3,000 yen's fine

46:43.008 --> 46:48.179
Of course, sending them to Atami
will be much cheaper for us

46:50.182 --> 46:52.016
Dear?

46:54.228 --> 46:55.728
What is it?

47:00.651 --> 47:05.905
We're making plans
to send the old folks to Atami spa

47:06.031 --> 47:07.907
That's a great idea

47:08.033 --> 47:12.328
I wish I could show them around,
but l’m just so busy

47:12.454 --> 47:17.333
- So you agree?
- Absolutely. It’s a great idea

47:17.459 --> 47:19.877
Let's do it, then

47:20.003 --> 47:24.298
- We can do nothing for them here
- Yeah, you're right

47:24.424 --> 47:26.092
Atami is a good idea

47:26.218 --> 47:28.678
Rather than tramping around Tokyo...

47:28.804 --> 47:31.681
...they can bathe in the hot springs
and relax

47:31.807 --> 47:35.393
- The old folks will love it, won't they?
- You're right

47:38.438 --> 47:40.356
They are late, though

47:41.400 --> 47:44.902
- Perhaps they're at Noriko's place
- Oh, maybe

48:26.111 --> 48:30.114
l’ve never been to a hot springs before

48:31.283 --> 48:34.285
We've put them to additional expense

48:35.454 --> 48:37.872
Isn't this nice, though?

48:39.458 --> 48:43.586
Let's get up early tomorrow
and take a walk along the beach

48:43.712 --> 48:45.546
Let's do that

48:45.672 --> 48:50.635
The scenery around here
is supposed to be lovely

48:50.761 --> 48:54.555
- That's what the maid told me
- Really?

48:57.893 --> 49:00.102
The sea is so calm

49:51.822 --> 49:54.573
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- The noodles have arrived

49:54.700 --> 49:57.743
- What's the bet?
- You had that?

49:57.869 --> 50:00.871
- That hurts me
- Not bad, not bad

50:04.835 --> 50:06.961
- There you are
- l’ll take, l’ll take

50:09.339 --> 50:11.590
- Ready!
- Ready?

50:11.717 --> 50:14.427
- You discarded this?
- Yeah, I did

50:14.553 --> 50:16.262
l’m out

50:16.388 --> 50:18.723
How do you like that, you idiot?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.645
That makes 1632

50:24.771 --> 50:26.397
He thrashed us!

51:00.640 --> 51:03.642
It’s so noisy

51:12.652 --> 51:15.362
I wonder how late it is

51:28.085 --> 51:29.794
Evening!

53:29.497 --> 53:32.166
What's the matter?

53:32.292 --> 53:34.919
You didn't sleep well last night,
did you?

53:37.422 --> 53:39.423
But you slept well

53:39.549 --> 53:42.801
No, I didn't sleep a wink

53:42.928 --> 53:45.971
You say that,
but you were sound asleep

53:46.097 --> 53:47.806
Really?

53:47.933 --> 53:51.852
This place is for the younger generation

53:51.978 --> 53:53.604
You're right

54:05.450 --> 54:09.286
Hey, what about those newlyweds?
They made so much noise!

54:09.412 --> 54:11.914
Do you think they're really
honeymooners?

54:12.040 --> 54:16.126
He was up this morning,
but she was lolling in bed

54:16.253 --> 54:17.544
He's a fool

54:17.671 --> 54:24.176
I heard him tell her, "You're all mine!
Ears, eyes, mouth, all mine!"

54:24.302 --> 54:26.971
A woman like her!

54:37.148 --> 54:39.900
I wonder how Kyoko's getting on
by herself

54:42.988 --> 54:44.780
Shall we head home?

54:46.658 --> 54:49.910
Are you feeling homesick already?

54:50.036 --> 54:54.123
You're the one that's homesick,
aren't you?

54:56.626 --> 55:00.379
We've seen Tokyo,
we've seen Atami

55:01.506 --> 55:06.802
- Shall we go home?
- Very well, let's go home

55:20.817 --> 55:22.526
What's the matter?

55:25.697 --> 55:30.409
I just felt slightly dizzy.
l’m fine now

55:30.535 --> 55:33.912
You didn't sleep very well, that's why.
Let's go

56:05.737 --> 56:10.616
How about sweeping it back?
That would suit you

56:10.742 --> 56:12.284
You think so?

56:12.410 --> 56:15.079
You have a lovely neckline

56:15.205 --> 56:19.291
Keep the left side flat
and put a wave in the right side

56:19.417 --> 56:23.253
- l’ll try it next time
- It will enhance your personality

56:24.714 --> 56:27.925
Kiyo, pass me another magazine.
And some matches

56:42.273 --> 56:45.234
- Welcome
- We're back

56:46.486 --> 56:49.947
What? Back so soon?

56:53.201 --> 56:57.079
- Afternoon
- Why didn't you stay longer?

56:57.205 --> 57:01.291
- What happened?
- Well...

57:05.922 --> 57:07.548
Afternoon

57:18.560 --> 57:22.771
- Who's that?
- Just some friends from the country

57:25.942 --> 57:28.652
Kiyo, take over this for me

57:40.623 --> 57:43.000
What happened?
You're back so soon

57:43.960 --> 57:48.046
- How was Atami?
- Yes, we liked the hot baths

57:48.173 --> 57:51.884
And our room had a lovely view

57:52.010 --> 57:57.556
I know. That hotel's only just
been built. Was it crowded?

57:57.682 --> 58:00.893
Hmm... a little crowded

58:01.019 --> 58:05.272
- And what about the food?
- Sashimi, savoury egg custard...

58:05.398 --> 58:08.734
Their sashimi is tasty.
It’s on the coast, that's why

58:08.860 --> 58:11.904
And they served huge omelettes, too

58:12.030 --> 58:16.200
How come you came back?
We wanted you to relax

58:16.326 --> 58:18.869
We thought you'd have
two or three days' rest

58:20.079 --> 58:23.248
We thought it was time
we got back home

58:23.374 --> 58:27.461
So soon?
You're not that often in Tokyo

58:27.587 --> 58:30.506
Still, we'd better be going

58:30.632 --> 58:33.550
Kyoko must be feeling lonely at home

58:33.676 --> 58:37.763
She'll be fine, Mother.
She's not a baby anymore

58:37.889 --> 58:40.807
Next time, I plan to take you
to the Kabuki theatre

58:40.934 --> 58:46.146
I don't want to put you
to so much expense

58:47.148 --> 58:49.566
I just want you to relax

58:49.692 --> 58:54.905
Still, my colleagues are holding
a meeting here tonight from 7:00

58:55.031 --> 58:58.200
Oh? Will there be many of them?

58:58.326 --> 59:01.703
Yes. It’s my turn to be host

59:01.829 --> 59:04.957
We've come back
at the wrong moment

59:05.083 --> 59:10.462
I should have told you. That's why
I wanted you to stay at Atami

59:12.340 --> 59:16.426
- The dye's ready
- All right. Excuse me

59:31.776 --> 59:33.402
What shall we do?

59:35.446 --> 59:37.072
I don't know

59:38.366 --> 59:42.869
We can't go to Koichi's
and bother them again

59:42.996 --> 59:48.792
You're right.
Shall we get Noriko to put us up?

59:48.918 --> 59:54.006
She hasn't got room for both of us.
You go there

59:55.091 --> 59:56.800
What about you?

59:57.677 --> 01:00:03.098
l’ll visit the Hattori family
and stay there if I can

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.518
Anyway, let's get going

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:19.114
Well, we've become homeless at last

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:15.045
- Noriko ought to be home by now
- You think so?

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.339
Perhaps it's still a bit early

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:23.053
If you're going to the Hattori family,
you'd better start now

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.473
Yes, we'd better go

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.331
That's just like you

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:18.233
Isn't Tokyo vast?

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:20.485
Isn't it just?

01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:26.324
If we were to get lost,
we might find never each other again

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:49.765
Hattori - Professional Scribe

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:57.063
Is that how long it's been?

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.650
It must be 17 or 18 years

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.235
Really?

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:05.238
Still, you've sent me a card
every New Year's

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:07.199
Don't mention it

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:10.827
I suppose Onomichi
has changed a lot

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:15.415
Well, fortunately, it wasn't bombed

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:19.878
The area you used to live in
hasn't changed at all

01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:23.590
Is that right?
It was such a nice place

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:28.470
We used to enjoy the view
from the Senko temple

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:32.808
The price of sea bream used to drop
after the cherry blossom season

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.185
We haven't eaten it
since we moved to Tokyo

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.187
That's so true

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.191
Listen, dear...

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:44.611
Hmm, later

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:52.202
Tell my friends
l’ll be playing pin-ball round there

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.371
- See you later
- Thank you

01:03:55.998 --> 01:04:00.627
We rent the upstairs room to him.
He likes going out at night

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:06.091
He's a law student,
but he never does any studying

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.051
Really?

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:13.431
He's always gambling at pin-ball
and mah-jong. I feel sorry for his father

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.435
Go on, dear...

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:20.647
How's about going for a drink
for old times' sake?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.943
l’m sure my cooking isn't
good enough for you

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:27.445
Forgive me for turning up
out of the blue

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:32.242
- Remember our old police chief?
- Numata?

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:37.539
- He lives nearby
- Does he? How is he?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:42.085
He's fine. His son's an executive
in a printing company

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:45.964
- Well, good for him
- Shall we pay him a visit?

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:49.509
That would be wonderful

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:53.722
Fancy that?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.157
- Drink up
- l’ve had plenty

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:15.535
Drink up, for old times' sake!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:21.583
I haven't touched a drink in years

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:25.378
Remember how you drank
when the Governor visited us?

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:27.297
You mean at the Takemura?

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.967
You got absolutely legless!

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.762
Remember that young geisha
who served us?

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.723
- Umeko?
- You really took a fancy to her

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:43.229
So did the Governor,
if you remember?

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.732
And you, as well

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:51.613
Ah, youth! I always disgraced myself
whenever I got drunk

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:56.117
Not at all!
Drink is good for your health

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:04.000
You're lucky, your children
are all well settled

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.378
l’m not so sure about that

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:11.341
I often wish at least
one of my sons were alive

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.927
Both were killed in the war

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:16.888
Didn't you lose one?

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:20.600
Yes, my second son

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:23.728
l’ve had enough of war

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:30.902
It’s hard to lose one's children

01:06:31.028 --> 01:06:36.700
However, living with them
isn't always easy, either

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.911
A real dilemma

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.124
Let's drink

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.336
Let's change the subject

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.424
- And cheer up!
- Yes!

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:57.637
If I had an extra bedroom for you,
we could drink till morning

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.061
Miss, more sake!

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.815
Come on, Miss,
bring us some sake...

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:17.532
Anyway, l’m really glad you came

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:21.411
I never dreamed
I'd see you here in Tokyo

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.843
Okaya Noodles

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.281
Here's some warm sake

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.868
Pour one for me, would you?

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:03.953
You're so drunk

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:10.585
Hirayama, she looks like
someone, don't you think?

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:13.963
- Here we go again!
- Don't you think so?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.131
Well, like who?

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.886
- Yes, she does
- Like who?

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:25.183
- That geisha Umeko?
- Oh, no! She was much fatter

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:28.770
- She looks like my wife
- You're right

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:31.064
See, especially here...

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:34.399
Isn't it time you went home?
You've had enough

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.487
- And both of them are bad-tempered!
- You're being a nuisance

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.948
That's what my wife says, too

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.618
Hey, come here and pour for me

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.038
Have some more

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.625
No, thanks

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:58.633
I think you're the luckiest one of all

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.676
How come?

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:05.014
With good sons and daughters
to be proud of

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.308
You can be proud of yours, too

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:10.435
No, my son's no good

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:14.524
He's henpecked
and treats me like l’m in the way

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.568
He's nothing!

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.198
But being head of department
is a good position

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.993
Head of nothing, more like!

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.620
He's only an assistant section chief

01:09:27.746 --> 01:09:34.294
I get so depressed that I lie to people
about his position

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.171
He's a failure

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:39.549
I don't think so

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:45.013
He's my only son,
so I spared the rod and spoiled him

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:50.935
You brought your son up properly

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.645
He has a degree and everything!

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:57.066
All doctors have to have degrees

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:02.655
l’m afraid we expect
too much of our children

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:06.534
They lack spirit

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.871
And they lack ambition

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:13.041
l’ve told my son that

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:16.669
He said that there are
too many people in Tokyo...

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:19.255
...that it's hard to get ahead

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:23.259
What do you think?
Young people today have no backbone

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.387
Where is their spirit?

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.265
That's not how I raised him!

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:33.102
But Numata...

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.190
You don't agree with me?

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:42.237
- You're satisfied?
- Of course not, but...

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:46.324
You see?
Even you aren't satisfied

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.832
It makes me feel so sad

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:58.753
No more to drink

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:10.556
However, Numata,
until I came up to Tokyo...

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:14.310
...I was under the impression
that my son was doing better

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:20.400
But l’ve found that he's only
a small neighbourhood doctor

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:23.152
I know how you feel

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.572
l’m as dissatisfied as you are

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:32.745
But we can't expect too much
from our children, Numata

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:36.958
Times have changed.
We have to face it

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:40.837
- That's what I think
- Is it?

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:46.134
- Yes
- I see. You, too

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:51.889
My son has really changed,
but there's nothing I can do about it

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:58.438
After all, there are
too many people in Tokyo

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.815
You think so?

01:12:00.941 --> 01:12:03.776
I suppose I should be happy

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.947
Maybe you're right

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:14.787
Nowadays, some young men
kill their parents without a thought

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:18.499
At least mine wouldn't do that

01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:25.131
Look, it's gone midnight

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.301
So what?

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.012
It’s time you went home

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:37.602
You get more and more like my wife.
I like you, you know?

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:40.730
Do something with him, will you?

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:43.399
Leave him alone

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:47.528
Let's drink up tonight, right?

01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:49.655
A wonderful night, eh?

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.242
Wonderful, wonderful

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.536
Wonderful night

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:32.031
Thank you. That's enough for me

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:37.537
It’s been a long day today

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.873
First we get back from Atami...

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.042
...then to Shige's house...

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.712
...then over to Ueno Park

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.798
You must be tired

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.633
Not so much

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.679
And here I am, troubling you

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:57.723
- l’m so sorry
- Not at all

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:03.855
But I really appreciate your coming.
l’m so happy

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.941
l’m a burden to everyone

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:11.028
- You've done more than enough
- Really?

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.323
Thank you so much

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:28.296
You must go to bed now.
You have your work tomorrow morning

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:32.550
You need to go to bed, too.
Let's both get some sleep

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:38.055
- Very well. I think I will
- Please do

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:54.113
What a treat,
to sleep in Shoji's bed

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.123
Noriko...

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:09.629
- Forgive me if l’m being rude...
- What is it?

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:14.217
Well, it's been eight years
since my son's death...

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:19.388
...yet you still keep
his photo up there like that

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:23.559
I feel sorry for you

01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:25.895
Why?

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:29.565
Because you're young and...

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.027
l’m not that young anymore

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:35.571
Yes, you are

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:39.116
I feel we're doing you wrong

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:42.161
l’ve often talked to Father about this

01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:46.082
If you ever meet someone else...

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.544
...you must feel free
to get remarried any time

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:52.630
I mean it

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:57.718
It pains us to think
that you won't remarry

01:15:58.428 --> 01:16:00.638
All right, if I meet the right man...

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:03.307
You certainly will

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.726
Why wouldn't you?

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.812
You think so?

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:12.733
You had more hard times
than happiness after marrying him

01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:17.113
I know we should have done
something for you

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:21.075
Please, Mother.
l’m quite happy as I am

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:25.871
But you should have had
a better life

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:29.875
Not at all. I like it this way

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:34.088
You may be happy
while you're still young...

01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:40.344
...but as you get older,
you'll find it lonely

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:44.181
I won't get that old,
so don't worry

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:50.271
You're such a good person

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.733
Goodnight, then

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.998
Goodnight

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.126
Good evening!

01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:59.340
Hello? Hello?

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.134
Mrs Kaneko?

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.637
Yes? Who is it?

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.889
Who could it be?

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:16.524
- Who is it?
- The police. Officer Takahashi

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.526
Oh, all right...

01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:28.786
Sorry for calling so late.
l’ve brought your friends round

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:30.788
They're quite drunk

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:34.709
Why, Father!

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.379
- l’m terribly sorry
- Goodnight

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:54.687
Who's he, Father?

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:04.530
Father, what's all this?

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.032
Father!

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.871
Hey, what's happened?

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.291
- He's brought some stranger with him
- Who is it?

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.377
- I don't know
- Stop all the noise!

01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:22.256
What's all this, Father?

01:19:22.382 --> 01:19:23.591
Father!

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:27.595
- Father! What's all this?
- Well...

01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:37.271
Hopeless!
You've started drinking again!

01:19:39.399 --> 01:19:41.442
Hello? Hello?

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.402
Hey, you! Hey, you!

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.242
Father? Father!

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.037
You're hopeless!

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.794
What happened?
Where's he been drinking?

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.588
Where? How should I know?

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:06.091
He used to drink all the time

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:10.971
Used to come home blind drunk,
upsetting Mother

01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:13.265
We hated it

01:20:13.391 --> 01:20:16.769
But he stopped drinking
after Kyoko was born

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:20.105
He was like a new man,
I thought it was great

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.650
Now he's started again

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.159
Hey, what shall we do?

01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:37.540
I didn't expect him back here tonight,
let alone with company!

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:53.222
- We can't leave them there like that
- It can't be helped

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:56.684
Let's bring Kiyo down
and we'll put them upstairs

01:20:57.727 --> 01:20:59.812
They're too drunk to make it upstairs

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.024
What shall we do?

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:06.068
What a mess!

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:11.115
You sleep upstairs.
l’ll put them here

01:21:15.912 --> 01:21:17.454
What a bother!

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:21.166
Why didn't he tell me
he was coming back?

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:26.046
So late and so drunk!

01:21:27.507 --> 01:21:29.592
I hate drunkards

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.346
And with a stranger, too

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.516
Oh, I can't bear it!

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:27.816
- Thank you for letting me stay
- Not at all

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:30.402
l’m sorry the place is such a mess

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:37.034
Won't you be late for work?
Will you be all right?

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.120
Yes, l’ll be fine

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.635
- Mother?
- What is it?

01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:58.681
I want you to have this

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:03.143
- What is it?
- Spending money for you

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:08.774
- What do you mean?
- It’s not much, though

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.360
You don't have to do this!

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:14.321
Please take it, Mother!

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:17.491
- I couldn't possibly
- Please, Mother!

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:20.285
- I couldn't...
- Please

01:23:22.038 --> 01:23:24.748
l’m the one who should be
giving you something

01:23:24.874 --> 01:23:28.377
Please accept it, Mother

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.045
Please

01:23:31.214 --> 01:23:32.673
Must I?

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:37.136
Then thank you very much, my dear

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:38.721
Please

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.478
You must need money for yourself,
but still you do this for me

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:49.523
I don't know what to say...

01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:54.153
...but thank you so much

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:55.946
Thank you

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.283
Let's get going, Mother

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:01.535
Yes...

01:24:05.623 --> 01:24:10.836
If you come up to Tokyo again,
Mother, please visit me

01:24:13.923 --> 01:24:17.968
But I don't know
whether l’ll be able to...

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:25.851
I know you're busy, but you should
try to come to Onomichi

01:24:26.686 --> 01:24:30.856
I'd really like to,
if only it were a bit nearer

01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:35.444
You're right. It’s so far away

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.678
Mother, you forgot these

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:05.474
Oh, again! l’ve got so forgetful lately

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.524
Let's go, then

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.969
Next Tokaido line departure
on Platform 14

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:46.598
21:00 express to Hiroshima

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.882
It’s packed, isn't it?

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:24.803
But we're in a good position
to get seats here

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.641
The train should arrive in Nagoya
or Gifu by morning

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:34.688
- When does it arrive in Onomichi?
- 01:35 tomorrow afternoon

01:26:34.814 --> 01:26:38.734
Did you send Kyoko a telegram?

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.652
Yes, I did

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:43.322
Keizo will meet you at Osaka, too

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:48.368
Mother, I hope you have
a good sleep on the train

01:26:48.494 --> 01:26:52.247
She can sleep soundly anywhere!

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:56.668
Even if I don't,
l’ll be home tomorrow afternoon

01:26:56.794 --> 01:26:59.880
And Father, don't drink too much

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.593
Well, last night's reunion
was an exception

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.888
Has the headache gone?

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.515
It’s fine

01:27:11.517 --> 01:27:13.852
Let this be a warning

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:18.148
l’m sure it was a good lesson

01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:23.612
You've been very kind to us, all of you.
We enjoyed our trip

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:28.700
Thanks for looking after us
when you have such busy lives

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:33.789
Now that we've seen you all,
you needn't come down...

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:36.833
...even if anything should happen
to either one of us

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.711
Don't talk like that, Mother

01:27:39.837 --> 01:27:41.672
This isn't a farewell

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:46.510
I mean it. We live so far away

01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:53.350
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
The 21:00 departure is now ready...

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:38.437
- Morning
- Morning

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:44.735
- Morning
- Morning. Sorry about yesterday

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:53.910
- I heard your parents came
- Yes. What a palaver

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:58.332
They weren't supposed to get off
the train, but my mother became ill

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:03.837
- What was the trouble?
- She didn't feel well here

01:29:03.963 --> 01:29:06.506
- Was it her heart?
- Travel sickness, I reckon

01:29:06.632 --> 01:29:09.426
She hadn't been on a train
for a long time

01:29:10.803 --> 01:29:13.013
What a drama

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:17.642
I had to borrow blankets
and send for the doctor twice

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.523
- And how is she now?
- She's feeling fine this morning

01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:25.233
How old is she?

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.361
Let me see...

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.863
She's way over 60

01:29:29.989 --> 01:29:32.491
67 or 68, maybe

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.910
Fairly old, then

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:37.204
Take good care of her

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.998
"Honour your parents
while they are still alive"

01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:42.292
That's right

01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:46.296
And they say, "One cannot serve
one's parents beyond the grave"

01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:05.690
It must've been
because the train was so crowded

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.692
You're probably right

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.447
- Feeling better?
- I feel fine now

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:23.875
I should be able
to leave for home tonight

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:30.257
Well, let's stay here one more night
and tomorrow take a less crowded train

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:36.430
Kyoko must be worried about us

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:44.688
But at least we're here in Osaka
and able to see Keizo

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:49.067
In the past ten days
we've managed to see all our children

01:30:51.904 --> 01:30:54.906
And our grown-up grandchildren, too

01:30:56.033 --> 01:30:59.995
Some grandparents seem to prefer their
grandchildren more than their children

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.580
What do you think?

01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:04.124
What about you?

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:07.627
I prefer my own children

01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:09.463
I agree with you

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:13.258
But it surprises me
how children change

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:18.722
Shige used to be
a much nicer person before

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.932
She did, didn't she?

01:31:21.058 --> 01:31:24.311
When a daughter marries,
she becomes a stranger

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:29.524
Koichi has changed, too.
He used to be such a nice boy

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:32.777
Children never live up
to their parents' expectations

01:31:34.947 --> 01:31:39.159
Let's just be happy that
they're better than most

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:43.580
They're certainly
better than average

01:31:43.706 --> 01:31:46.249
We're fortunate

01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:48.835
I think so, too

01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:51.838
We should consider ourselves lucky

01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:55.634
Yes, we are very lucky

01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:30.043
My folks had to get off the train
at Osaka

01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:31.836
Oh, really?

01:32:37.593 --> 01:32:41.221
Mother became sick on the train

01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:44.933
They got home on the 10th

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:54.150
Is she all right now?

01:32:54.277 --> 01:32:57.279
I think so.
They wrote to say thanks

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.364
She must've been tired

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.285
The trip was too much for her

01:33:04.787 --> 01:33:08.290
- Was she satisfied?
- Why wouldn't she be?

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.501
She got to see lots of places
and went to Atami, too

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:13.545
I suppose so

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:16.298
She'll talk about Tokyo
for a long time to come

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:27.726
Hello?

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.228
Speaking...

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:33.273
A telegram?

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:36.693
Not yet. Where from?

01:33:36.819 --> 01:33:38.737
From Onomichi

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:41.740
It came today, but it's very odd

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:44.576
It says mother's critically ill

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:48.079
Eh? That's right

01:33:48.205 --> 01:33:49.914
That's strange

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.917
I just got a letter from father

01:33:55.087 --> 01:33:58.965
It says they got off at Osaka
because mother felt sick

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:02.302
They arrived home in Onomichi
on the 10th

01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:07.891
That's right

01:34:09.268 --> 01:34:10.727
Telegram!

01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:12.437
Hold on

01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:21.571
Thank you

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.286
- It’s from Onomichi
- Read it

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.708
"Mother critically ill - Kyoko"

01:34:34.877 --> 01:34:37.295
Hello? Hello?

01:34:39.382 --> 01:34:41.466
The telegram just arrived

01:34:41.592 --> 01:34:43.885
You just got one too?

01:34:46.722 --> 01:34:49.474
Right, l’ll come over

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:54.938
- See you later
- l’ll be waiting

01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:59.317
How did it happen so suddenly?

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:07.158
I wonder if it's serious

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.704
Should I let Noriko know?

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.164
Yes, do that for me

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:03.131
Yes? Yoneyama Trading Company

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.675
Hold the line, please

01:36:10.639 --> 01:36:12.140
Miss Hirayama, telephone!

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.976
For me?

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.821
Hello?

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:29.574
Oh, hello

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:34.162
Mother is?

01:36:40.002 --> 01:36:41.586
Is that so?

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:48.635
Thank you

01:37:41.063 --> 01:37:42.939
What can it mean?

01:37:43.065 --> 01:37:45.149
I can understand Father falling ill

01:37:46.485 --> 01:37:48.903
But Mother's got so much vitality

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:51.489
Think it's serious?

01:37:53.158 --> 01:37:56.369
It’s not good.
They said "critically ill"

01:37:56.495 --> 01:37:59.539
I suppose we'll have to go then

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:04.127
I sensed something wasn't right
at the station

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:06.796
She said,
"If anything should happen..."

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:12.010
She must've had a bad feeling,
somehow or other

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:19.267
- Anyway, we should go and see her
- I guess so, since she's critically ill

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:22.312
If we're going, we better hurry.
We should take the express

01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:28.902
l’ll have to make all kinds
of arrangements before I leave

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:31.070
So will I

01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:34.115
In the middle of this busy time, too

01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:50.340
Come in

01:38:51.216 --> 01:38:54.135
Hey, can you bring a bandage?

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.096
A bandage

01:39:02.561 --> 01:39:04.896
Let's leave tonight, then

01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:08.733
Might as well, if we have to go.
See you later

01:39:12.738 --> 01:39:14.197
Brother?

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:16.991
What is it?

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:20.411
What about mourning clothes?
Shall we take them?

01:39:23.248 --> 01:39:25.124
Maybe we should

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:28.002
All right, let's take them

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.630
Let's just hope
we don't need to use them

01:39:30.756 --> 01:39:34.384
- Right
- l’ll meet you at Tokyo Station

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:29.230
l’ll go and meet them, Father

01:40:30.941 --> 01:40:33.735
That's very good of you

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:17.361
l’ll be back soon

01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:43.888
What's the matter?

01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:49.727
Are you too hot?

01:41:51.563 --> 01:41:55.024
The children are coming from Tokyo
to see you

01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:57.568
Kyoko's just gone to meet them

01:41:57.694 --> 01:42:00.404
They'll be here any moment

01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:28.349
You'll get better

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:31.352
You will...

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:26.532
Her blood pressure's dropped,
but she's still in a coma

01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:28.284
I see

01:43:42.007 --> 01:43:43.841
Her reactions are weak

01:43:44.927 --> 01:43:48.012
- Thank you, anyway
- l’ll drop by again

01:43:48.138 --> 01:43:50.014
Thank you for coming

01:43:59.024 --> 01:44:00.608
Take care

01:44:24.633 --> 01:44:28.052
I wonder where Keizo is.
He's so late

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:37.561
- Did he answer the telegram?
- No, not a word

01:44:42.651 --> 01:44:46.279
But he lives in Osaka,
the closest of all of us

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:53.452
Father, come with me

01:44:53.578 --> 01:44:55.204
You as well

01:45:12.931 --> 01:45:16.976
Listen, Father,
I don't like her condition

01:45:17.102 --> 01:45:18.728
I see...

01:45:26.695 --> 01:45:29.280
What do you mean?

01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:31.782
I mean it's dangerous

01:45:33.702 --> 01:45:37.830
The fact that she's still in a coma
isn't a good sign

01:45:37.956 --> 01:45:39.790
I see...

01:45:39.916 --> 01:45:43.461
Did the trip to Tokyo exhaust her
and bring this on?

01:45:43.587 --> 01:45:48.591
I don't think so. She was so lively
in Tokyo. Wasn't she?

01:45:51.636 --> 01:45:55.556
- It might've caused it
- So what is it, then?

01:45:57.225 --> 01:45:59.602
She may not live till tomorrow morning

01:46:00.312 --> 01:46:01.979
Tomorrow morning?

01:46:03.565 --> 01:46:05.983
It'll probably happen around dawn

01:46:06.943 --> 01:46:10.279
I see...
She's not going to live

01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:20.831
Mother's 68, isn't she?

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:27.338
So... she's not going to live

01:46:28.965 --> 01:46:30.591
That's what I think

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:33.511
I see...

01:46:35.097 --> 01:46:38.057
So this is the end?

01:46:39.684 --> 01:46:41.685
That's all

01:47:10.048 --> 01:47:12.550
Then Keizo won't be in time, will he?

01:48:51.983 --> 01:48:54.944
Life's too short, isn't it?

01:48:56.905 --> 01:48:58.989
She was so lively, too

01:49:01.159 --> 01:49:03.577
She must've had a feeling
this would happen

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.164
Perhaps

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:13.921
Still, l’m glad she came to Tokyo

01:49:15.006 --> 01:49:17.383
We were able to see her alive

01:49:19.177 --> 01:49:21.220
And we talked about many things

01:49:22.514 --> 01:49:26.058
Noriko, did you bring
any mourning clothes?

01:49:26.184 --> 01:49:29.853
- No
- You should've brought some

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:33.232
Do you have any, Kyoko?

01:49:33.358 --> 01:49:35.109
No, I don't

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:37.486
You'll have to borrow some, then

01:49:37.612 --> 01:49:39.863
And get some for Noriko, too

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:53.210
At least mother died peacefully
and without suffering at all

01:49:56.881 --> 01:49:58.966
I wonder if that's Keizo

01:50:08.393 --> 01:50:10.311
How is she?

01:50:18.987 --> 01:50:21.905
So... I wasn't in time

01:50:24.326 --> 01:50:26.410
I was afraid of that

01:50:35.003 --> 01:50:36.420
Good day

01:50:39.841 --> 01:50:43.177
Unfortunately,
I was out of town on business

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:45.679
l’m sorry l’m late

01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:50.100
- The telegram came while I was away
- Really?

01:50:52.062 --> 01:50:54.647
How awful...

01:50:54.773 --> 01:50:56.231
When was it?

01:50:57.525 --> 01:51:01.487
This morning... at 3:15

01:51:01.613 --> 01:51:03.113
I see...

01:51:04.532 --> 01:51:08.952
If I'd taken the 8:40 train from
Kagoshima, I would've been in time

01:51:10.038 --> 01:51:14.833
Keizo, look at her.
See how peaceful she is

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.080
Forgive my delay

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.509
Where's father?

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.178
I wonder

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.381
Father...

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:48.552
- Keizo has just arrived
- Has he?

01:52:50.388 --> 01:52:53.390
It was such a beautiful dawn

01:52:57.562 --> 01:53:00.481
It’s going to be another hot day today

01:55:27.837 --> 01:55:29.338
What's the matter?

01:55:30.214 --> 01:55:32.382
I can't stand that sound

01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:35.302
Why?

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:41.224
As I hear it, I feel as if my mother
were becoming smaller, bit by bit

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:45.354
I wasn't a very good son

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.905
It’s time to offer incense

01:55:56.991 --> 01:55:59.451
I can't lose her now

01:55:59.577 --> 01:56:03.080
"One cannot serve one's parents
beyond the grave"

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:49.251
We used to watch fireworks
from this room, didn't we, Father?

01:56:49.377 --> 01:56:51.545
Oh, did we?

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:54.339
On the night of the town festival

01:56:54.465 --> 01:56:57.134
- Remember, Keizo?
- No, I don't

01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:02.180
You were so excited,
but after sunset you fell asleep

01:57:02.306 --> 01:57:05.017
With your head on mother's lap

01:57:05.143 --> 01:57:07.310
I really don't remember

01:57:09.022 --> 01:57:11.523
What were you doing
in those days, Father?

01:57:12.650 --> 01:57:16.111
I was head of the city's
board of education, I believe

01:57:16.237 --> 01:57:19.406
Were you?
A long time ago, wasn't it?

01:57:20.408 --> 01:57:23.201
Once we all went to Omishima
during the spring holidays

01:57:23.327 --> 01:57:26.371
Oh, that I do remember

01:57:26.497 --> 01:57:31.543
- Mother got seasick
- Yes, I remember that

01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:36.131
She was so full of life then

01:57:36.257 --> 01:57:39.676
How old was she then? Forty...?

01:57:40.428 --> 01:57:44.139
Forty-two or forty-three, I think

01:57:44.265 --> 01:57:47.642
You have to take good care
of yourself now, Father...

01:57:47.769 --> 01:57:49.728
...and enjoy a long life

01:57:49.854 --> 01:57:51.521
Thank you

01:58:02.283 --> 01:58:04.201
Some more?

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:11.875
More, sis?

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:27.265
It may sound heartless to say so...

01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:30.477
...but I rather wish father had died first

01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:35.732
If Kyoko gets married,
he'll be left all alone

01:58:37.693 --> 01:58:38.985
Maybe

01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:42.489
We could've looked
after mother in Tokyo

01:58:43.741 --> 01:58:48.787
Kyoko, did mother still have
that grey summer sash?

01:58:48.913 --> 01:58:51.123
- Yes
- I'd like it as a memento

01:58:51.249 --> 01:58:53.917
- Is that all right, Brother?
- Why not?

01:58:54.043 --> 01:58:55.544
And also...

01:58:57.004 --> 01:58:59.422
...that linen kimono
she used to wear in summer?

01:58:59.549 --> 01:59:01.591
- It’s here
- I want that, too

01:59:01.717 --> 01:59:04.511
You know where it is?
Get it out for me

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:21.194
It’s all over now

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:28.118
Thank you all for coming so far
and giving up your precious time

01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:30.954
Thank you

01:59:38.087 --> 01:59:42.132
She would've been pleased
to know Koichi looked after her

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:47.095
I didn't really do anything

01:59:48.181 --> 01:59:54.144
I remember when we went
to Atami from Tokyo...

01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:58.231
...she had a dizzy spell

01:59:59.817 --> 02:00:04.529
- Oh?
- It didn't seem that serious

02:00:04.655 --> 02:00:08.700
Really? Why didn't you tell us, Father?

02:00:08.826 --> 02:00:11.411
You should've told Koichi at least

02:00:12.914 --> 02:00:14.998
I guess I should have

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:19.920
But that wasn't the cause

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:23.381
Mother was overweight,
so the illness came on suddenly

02:00:23.507 --> 02:00:24.925
I see...

02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:29.054
It’s just like a dream

02:00:30.264 --> 02:00:34.809
- When are you leaving, Brother?
- I can't stay long

02:00:34.936 --> 02:00:38.396
Me neither.
Shall we take the express tonight?

02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:43.526
- What about you, Keizo?
- I can stay

02:00:44.946 --> 02:00:47.239
- Let's leave tonight, then
- Right

02:00:47.365 --> 02:00:50.784
Noriko, you'll stay with father
a bit longer, won't you?

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:53.912
- Yes
- No, you're busy. l’ll be fine

02:00:54.038 --> 02:00:58.500
I might as well go, then.
I have to make a report.

02:00:58.626 --> 02:01:01.586
And there's that baseball match, too

02:01:01.712 --> 02:01:05.590
Well, thanks for coming
when you're so busy

02:01:05.716 --> 02:01:08.593
You'll be lonely now, Father

02:01:08.719 --> 02:01:11.596
l’ll get used to it

02:01:11.722 --> 02:01:14.391
Kyoko, pass me some more rice

02:01:15.685 --> 02:01:18.311
Get the train tickets for us,
will you, Keizo?

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:21.189
Yes. Rice for me, too

02:01:25.903 --> 02:01:28.113
I hope the train's empty

02:01:51.095 --> 02:01:54.264
Father, you mustn't drink too much

02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:56.766
l’ll be all right

02:02:03.607 --> 02:02:06.943
So, you're all going home?

02:03:05.294 --> 02:03:08.004
- Here's your lunch
- Thank you so much

02:03:10.758 --> 02:03:13.760
Thanks for letting me stay

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:17.180
Come and see me in Tokyo
in your summer holidays

02:03:17.306 --> 02:03:21.768
- Do you have to go home today?
- Yes, I must

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.353
Really?

02:03:24.438 --> 02:03:27.649
- Sorry I can't see you off
- That's all right

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:32.195
Do come and see me
in the summer holidays

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.826
l’m so glad you stayed

02:03:39.328 --> 02:03:43.373
I think my brothers and sister
should have stayed a bit longer

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:46.084
But they're very busy

02:03:46.210 --> 02:03:48.336
They're just selfish

02:03:49.213 --> 02:03:52.590
Demanding things
and then leaving just like that

02:03:52.716 --> 02:03:56.219
That can't be helped.
They have work to get back to

02:03:57.805 --> 02:04:00.432
But you have yours too

02:04:00.558 --> 02:04:04.727
- They think only of themselves
- But Kyoko...

02:04:06.397 --> 02:04:09.858
Asking for mementos of mother
right after her death!

02:04:10.901 --> 02:04:14.612
I felt so sorry for poor mother

02:04:15.739 --> 02:04:20.535
Even strangers would have been
more considerate

02:04:22.705 --> 02:04:27.083
But look, Kyoko,
I thought so too when I was your age

02:04:28.419 --> 02:04:33.256
But, as children get older,
they drift away from their parents

02:04:35.509 --> 02:04:39.637
A woman has her own life,
apart from her parents...

02:04:39.763 --> 02:04:42.182
...when she becomes Shige's age

02:04:43.726 --> 02:04:47.479
So she meant no harm, l’m sure

02:04:48.939 --> 02:04:53.151
They have their own lives to look after

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.987
I wonder...

02:04:56.113 --> 02:04:58.156
But I won't ever be like that

02:04:58.282 --> 02:05:00.867
Otherwise what's the point
of being part of a family?

02:05:01.619 --> 02:05:03.453
You're right

02:05:03.579 --> 02:05:09.167
But all children become like that
eventually

02:05:09.293 --> 02:05:11.127
You, too?

02:05:12.796 --> 02:05:16.382
I may become like that,
in spite of myself

02:05:17.927 --> 02:05:20.803
Isn't life disappointing?

02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:24.349
Yes, nothing but disappointment

02:05:29.813 --> 02:05:35.026
- Well, I should get going
- Goodbye, then

02:05:35.152 --> 02:05:37.320
Father, l’m leaving now

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:50.124
- Take care of yourself
- Thank you. You, too

02:05:51.627 --> 02:05:54.212
Come and see me
in the summer holidays

02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.174
Goodbye, then

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:02.345
- Goodbye
- See you soon

02:06:18.028 --> 02:06:20.863
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

02:06:56.609 --> 02:06:59.068
Has Kyoko left?

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:09.120
Father, l’m leaving
on the afternoon train

02:07:09.246 --> 02:07:11.748
Oh? You're going home?

02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:14.959
Thank you for everything

02:07:15.085 --> 02:07:17.545
Please, I didn't do anything

02:07:17.671 --> 02:07:21.424
- You've been a great help
- Not at all

02:07:24.845 --> 02:07:29.432
My wife told me
how kind you were to her...

02:07:29.558 --> 02:07:31.934
...when she stayed
at your place in Tokyo

02:07:32.061 --> 02:07:36.356
Not at all.
I didn't have much to offer

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:39.359
Well, she really meant it

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:42.987
She told me that evening with you
was her happiest time in Tokyo

02:07:43.113 --> 02:07:47.950
- I want to thank you, too
- Not at all

02:07:54.792 --> 02:08:00.338
She was so worried
about your future

02:08:00.464 --> 02:08:03.174
You mustn't go on like this

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:05.134
Don't worry about me

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:08.471
You should get remarried
if you meet the right man

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:13.351
Just forget about Shoji

02:08:14.895 --> 02:08:21.651
It pains me to see you
living like this

02:08:22.903 --> 02:08:26.155
No, it's not like that

02:08:26.281 --> 02:08:32.829
She said she'd never met
a nicer woman than you

02:08:34.081 --> 02:08:37.792
l’m sure she was overestimating me

02:08:37.918 --> 02:08:40.378
She certainly wasn't

02:08:40.504 --> 02:08:45.591
l’m not the nice woman
she thought I was

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:52.807
It embarrasses me that
you should think of me like that

02:08:52.933 --> 02:08:55.393
Well, it shouldn't

02:08:55.519 --> 02:08:58.646
Really, I can be quite selfish

02:09:00.023 --> 02:09:06.821
l’m not always thinking of your late son,
though you may think I am

02:09:07.614 --> 02:09:10.575
You should just forget him

02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:17.039
Often, there are days
when I don't think of him at all

02:09:19.877 --> 02:09:24.213
Sometimes I feel
I can't go on like this forever

02:09:25.215 --> 02:09:31.637
Often I lay awake at night wondering
what will become of me if I remain alone

02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:36.934
Days pass and nothing happens,
and I feel so alone

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:42.023
In my heart,
I seem to be waiting for something

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:48.112
- l’m just being selfish
- No, you're not

02:09:48.238 --> 02:09:49.781
Yes, I am

02:09:51.408 --> 02:09:54.869
But I couldn't say this to mother

02:09:55.913 --> 02:09:57.705
That's all right

02:09:57.831 --> 02:10:01.584
You truly are a good woman.
An honest woman

02:10:03.879 --> 02:10:05.379
Not at all

02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:35.785
This watch belonged to her

02:10:35.911 --> 02:10:38.788
It’s rather old-fashioned...

02:10:38.914 --> 02:10:42.917
...but she used it
since she was your age

02:10:43.043 --> 02:10:45.169
Please take it as a memento

02:10:45.295 --> 02:10:48.798
- But I...
- Please take it

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:55.054
l’m sure she'd be very happy
if you used it

02:10:56.223 --> 02:10:58.891
Please take it

02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.310
Thank you

02:11:05.858 --> 02:11:12.196
Please believe me when I say
that I want you to be happy

02:11:12.322 --> 02:11:15.491
I mean it sincerely

02:11:28.505 --> 02:11:30.256
It’s strange...

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.884
We have children of our own...

02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:38.681
...yet you've done the most for us,
and you're not even a blood relative

02:11:39.683 --> 02:11:41.684
Thank you

02:14:09.833 --> 02:14:13.502
You must be feeling lonely
with them all gone

02:14:14.504 --> 02:14:17.214
It was so sudden, wasn't it?

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:20.718
Well, she was a headstrong woman...

02:14:20.844 --> 02:14:23.220
...but if I'd known things
would come to this...

02:14:23.346 --> 02:14:27.475
...I'd have been kinder to her
while she was alive

02:14:28.977 --> 02:14:32.438
Living alone,
I think the days will seem very long

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:34.106
Absolutely

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:36.233
You'll feel lonely

02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:46.971
The End
