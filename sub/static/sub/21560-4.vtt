00:02.670 --> 00:04.605
Joe:
It still feels random.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.574
I searched
"Dallas plus Cowboys,"

00:06.607 --> 00:09.310
I'm sure the first hit
is a crappy NFL fan site,

00:09.343 --> 00:11.345
but the second site
that comes up?

00:11.379 --> 00:12.713
Yeah, well,
maybe Rover knows

00:12.746 --> 00:14.548
you don't give a shit
about football?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Yeah, I forgot you were

00:15.783 --> 00:17.585
an all-American running back
at Cal.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.220
Hey,
I went to a game once.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.523
I'm just saying,
Rover has a relevance problem.

Hey, is Scientology
a religion or a cult?
Cult.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.833
Never mind,
I'll figure out where it goes.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.269
These results
are mediocre at best.

00:35.303 --> 00:39.407
Final grade for Rover's
"genius" search engine -- C-.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.542
[Scoffs] D-.
[Motorcycle engine revs]

00:41.575 --> 00:43.244
Is that really necessary?

00:43.277 --> 00:44.745
That doesn't sound right.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.281
Sounds like
the, uh, gas line is --
I got it!

00:47.315 --> 00:48.782
Okay.

in an auto shop or anything.

Gordon: Well,
I can't hear myself think.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.226
Listen, if they fix
the relevance problem,

00:58.259 --> 00:59.727
we could have a competition
on our hands.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.530
Gordon: You know,
hit search for, um...

01:02.563 --> 01:03.731
Cameron: Is that Rover?

01:03.764 --> 01:05.633
We give it a C-.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.602

haven't seen it?

01:08.636 --> 01:10.138
No, I really haven't.

[Keyboard clacking]

01:16.344 --> 01:20.114
Oh, yeah.
I see what you mean.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.549
Even with
the basic rules engine,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.684
the results are garbage,
the crawler's too static.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.553
Mm.
Still, the way
they grabbed the titles

01:25.586 --> 01:27.488
is actually kind of clever.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.258
Okay, thanks for this --
Hey, I'm just gonna
check the HTML,

01:30.291 --> 01:31.792
it takes one second.

**

01:34.895 --> 01:36.630
Oh, yeah.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.332
The algorithm's
too stupid to know

01:38.366 --> 01:40.301
that there are
equivalent synonyms
for a search phrase,

01:40.334 --> 01:41.902
or different spellings.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.238
Like "color, c-o-l-o-r,"

01:44.272 --> 01:46.274
the English spelling,
with a "u."

01:48.509 --> 01:50.478
Still, I'd give it a B-.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.414
Gordon: [Groans] Pbht!
No, a solid B
for concept,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.349
but demerits
for poor execution.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.517
Hmm.
You asked.

Actually, we didn't.
No, we didn't.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.587
Neither one of us asked.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.155
This wouldn't be hard to beat,
you know?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.523
You just
have to come up with

02:02.556 --> 02:04.158
a more sophisticated
algorithm.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.659
That's not really
our approach.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.495
People need
a curated list,

02:07.528 --> 02:09.763
a guide through
the disorganized
maze of the web --

02:09.797 --> 02:11.432
not a bunch of
impersonal math.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.367
First of all,
math is very personal to me.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.469
Of course.
I just mean that --
And second,

02:15.503 --> 02:18.472
curation is fine
if you guys have 500 websites,

02:18.506 --> 02:19.907
or 5000.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.742
But what are you guys gonna do
when you have 5 million?

How are you gonna guide people
through that?

I didn't think you wanted

a qualitative difference

Users aren't getting
something useful as
their first return,

03:07.288 --> 03:08.722
so they're
leaving the site.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.658
Frankly,
we launched too early --

03:10.691 --> 03:12.426
We had a major competitor
in Comet --

03:12.460 --> 03:14.662
Okay, let's try not
to make this all about Comet.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.830
There's
the larger landscape of --
Exactly.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.433
We needed to get out there
to have a presence.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.534
Comet isn't competitive --

03:20.568 --> 03:22.503
What did I just say?
Sorry.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.605
It seems like
we were impatient.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.907
No. No.
No, it's good that we're live.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.908
It is.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.477
The growth will be there.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.845
The Rover algorithm's
gonna get better with usage.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.415
We needed users to track,

03:34.448 --> 03:36.584
the data is gonna help us
refine this algorithm.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.286
We've got to stay
competitive --

03:38.319 --> 03:40.354
I'm telling you,
we have a leg up on Comet --

Excuse me.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.923
Thank you.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.558
If we could just have faith
in our system --

03:44.592 --> 03:45.859
Hey, I do have faith.

03:45.893 --> 03:46.994
That's why I launched
the damn thing.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.429
The site is live,

03:48.462 --> 03:51.365
so the question of timing
is a moot point.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.567
Please don't come in here
and argue at me.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.504
I've got a lot of other things
on my plate.
All right.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.038
How can you
lead this effectively

03:58.071 --> 04:00.007
if you're not
speaking the same language?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.709

right now.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.654
And once
we grab all the land,

then we can think about
incorporating more code.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.859
The current model
isn't scalable.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.994
The three of us can't keep up
with the expansion.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.465
But we shouldn't add
more code.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.900
We should add
more people.
How many?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.969
I mean, we can't pay everybody
in Necco Wafers.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.971

is one thing...

04:31.004 --> 04:32.573
What's our
strongest section?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.808
Probably comedy.
Exactly.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.510
Haley loves comedy,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.712
so it's out most thorough,
well-organized section.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.414
Well, then,
we need experts.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.896
Can you, uh --

07:08.929 --> 07:09.963
Can you give us an example
of your methodology?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.499
For instance,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.066
how do you organize
your CDs?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.936
Well, my, um --

07:15.969 --> 07:18.005
my brother
is really into metal,

07:18.038 --> 07:20.574
and I helped him
manage his collection.

07:20.608 --> 07:24.044
I put all of the death metal CDs
on one shelf,

07:24.077 --> 07:26.980
from the simple bands like
Obituary and Cannibal Corpse

07:27.014 --> 07:28.582
on the left,

07:28.616 --> 07:31.619
to melodic and technical death
in the middle,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.086
eh, followed by death/black

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
and grind/death
and death crossovers,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.490
and then I put
the industrial death,

07:36.524 --> 07:38.959
folk death, and barely-death,
uh, at the end.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.194
And -- And then, the next shelf
was for black metal,

07:41.228 --> 07:43.030
uh, through the whole
Norwegian scene,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.832
like Mayhem and Burzum,

07:44.865 --> 07:46.166
through the un-black

07:46.199 --> 07:48.869

to call them...

08:32.112 --> 08:33.914
the surfers.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.216
Every day, we receive
hundreds of e-mails from people

08:36.249 --> 08:38.285
asking us to add their websites
to our index.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.987
Plus, we're constantly
on the look-out

08:40.020 --> 08:41.622
for new sites
to catalogue.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.290
When a surfer finds a site,
they categorize it

08:43.323 --> 08:44.992
and add it
to Comet's master list.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.227
Each group is responsible
for growing the index

08:48.796 --> 08:50.564
for the top five sites
in each category.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.832
Yeah, but the problem is,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.801
is that we started out
with five main topics.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.235
As new sites pop up,
you know,

08:55.268 --> 08:57.304
categorizing them becomes
more and more...complicated.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.239
Yeah, there's
an ontological term for that.
Yeah -- "shit-show."

with Entertainment.

of French New Wave

09:08.716 --> 09:10.784
as well as
the canon of John Candy.
Reggie: Yeah.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.153
Oh, did you know
that he played Cliff Murdoch,

09:13.186 --> 09:15.122
the Announcer in
"Rookie of the Year" --
uncredited?
Joe: Really?

09:15.155 --> 09:16.957
-Huh.
-Yeah.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.626
That's amazing.
Really cool, Reggie.
Take care, all right?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.228
See,
enthusiasm feeds them.
Yeah.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.096

Lorraine and Po,

09:23.130 --> 09:25.265
from Tower Records
and City Lights, respectively.

Hey,
where is your comedy geek?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.370

Good choice.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.172
Gordon: That is actually
my daughter Haley,

09:32.205 --> 09:33.206
who's part of the team.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.341
When she's not at school.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.843
And regional's over here.
Okay.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.144
You need a restaurant
recommendation?

These are your guys.
Risa: Ahem.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.347
Not just guys.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.383
Oh, Risa.
We met on a bus.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.118
She launched into
a list of restaurant ratings

09:45.152 --> 09:46.286
that would put Zagat's
to shame.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.356
FYI, Zagat's
has a new website,

09:49.389 --> 09:52.025
but the Biz team
scooped us --

09:52.059 --> 09:53.293
Zagat's is big business,

09:53.326 --> 09:55.028
it's international,
not regional.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.664
Joe: That's Macky
from Gold's Gym.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.131
You wouldn't believe it,
but this guy's got an MBA.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.266
Hmm.
Marketing honcho.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.101
I told Gold's
to launch a website --

10:01.134 --> 10:02.269
And when
they finally did --

10:02.302 --> 10:03.370
we scooped it up
from regional.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.005
Whoo!

Guys.
Well, you could
cross-reference it.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.842

So, you see our quandary.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.377
Yeah.

This is our head coder. Ted.

Oh.
He manages
the whole site for us.

Sorry to interrupt,

10:16.449 --> 10:18.385

Michael Houseman at AOL.

Feel free to, uh...

23:52.799 --> 23:55.502
I wanted
to talk to you about Cecil.

He's still having trouble
with whole pages.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.806
He's had a month.

be a little hard to
get rid of him.

of the team,

24:05.712 --> 24:07.747

24:07.780 --> 24:09.716
So the new kid's helping out
with the grunt work,

[Chuckles]

24:27.834 --> 24:31.003
I wanted to ask you
about something, too.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.073
Um, I heard that AOL

24:34.106 --> 24:35.842
is interested
in a search play.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.245
It might be a way
outta this whole mess.

24:39.278 --> 24:42.181
Look,
I-I'll be the first to admit

24:42.214 --> 24:45.117
that I don't know
the ins and the outs
of the code.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.620
But when it comes to buying
and selling companies,

24:47.654 --> 24:49.255
you could say
that's my bailiwick.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.892
How much do you think
we could get?

24:52.925 --> 24:56.796
My man says upwards
of three million.

24:56.829 --> 25:00.767
Okay, we have to pay off
the angel investors --

25:00.800 --> 25:02.068
Yeah, we'll do all right.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.203
We'll do all right,
about 400K apiece.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.973
But the team --

25:07.006 --> 25:08.975
They split almost
$1 million in cash.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.778
Now that's pretty good
for a bunch of young upstarts.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.613
But there's three of them.
No, I know.

This idea --
I really just don't think --
It's -- Look, it's --

i-it's still
nothing to sneeze at.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.017

25:18.050 --> 25:20.920
it sets you up great
for your next thing.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.556
Besides, the sad truth is,

25:23.590 --> 25:25.191
anyone done a search with us
leaves underwhelmed.

Huh?

The top search on Rover
is "sex."

popular search...is "Comet."

to be around $3 million.

Can I assume that
Bos speaks for the both of you?

25:57.824 --> 26:00.359

you have a lot of wisdom

26:00.392 --> 26:02.028
when it comes to sales.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.798
But we can't get out now.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.934
We have
a winning play here.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.770
Our algorithm-based system
has a half dozen copycats.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.739
Comet doesn't. Why?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.306
Because web growth
is projected to double

26:14.340 --> 26:15.307
by the end of this year,

26:15.341 --> 26:17.176
triple by the close of '95.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.646
The competition is exactly
the reason to get out now.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.380
We don't have
the right damn programmer --

26:21.413 --> 26:23.850

we don't make "small plays."

26:23.883 --> 26:25.952

26:25.985 --> 26:28.755
What I know, in my gut,

26:28.788 --> 26:30.289
is that search is poised

26:30.322 --> 26:32.324
to be
a billion-dollar business.

I don't care who you
run into on the golf course,

26:44.837 --> 26:48.875
you don't discuss my assets
with anyone but me.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.109
If the path to victory

26:50.142 --> 26:51.811
requires a change
in the Rover leadership,

26:51.844 --> 26:53.112
we can discuss that.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.615

have some grit.

walk out that door,

solve your problem.

about this.

the groups by topic,

What are you doing?

31:48.674 --> 31:50.409
Skating is coming on.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.244
It's Tonya and Nancy,
and all of America is watching,

31:52.278 --> 31:53.579
so I want to see
what happens.
I was watching "Real World,"

31:53.612 --> 31:55.414
and it's the episode
where David gets kicked off

31:55.447 --> 31:57.449
for pulling the sheets
off of Tami--
Oh, my God. Who cares?

31:57.483 --> 31:58.951
It's not even "real."
Girls, can you please?

31:58.985 --> 32:00.252
I read something online

32:00.286 --> 32:01.453
that said they generate
all the drama.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.554
Kind of like you.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.590
What is that?

32:04.623 --> 32:07.026
It's a golden surfboard.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.360
Yeah,
why do you have that?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.997
Honey,
where did you get that?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.398
Well, it's from Comet.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.333
And I know it's weird
to have a Comet trophy

32:14.366 --> 32:16.402
when you're working so hard
on Rover --

32:16.435 --> 32:17.569
No.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.138
Why does it say
"Potstickers"?

32:19.171 --> 32:20.272
Because I won it!

32:21.340 --> 32:24.076
Risa was doing a write-up
for the Benihana website,

32:24.110 --> 32:25.711
and I told her
that I love potstickers

32:25.744 --> 32:28.314
so she named our
team Potstickers,
and today we won.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.349
And we kicked
Feel the Burn's ass!

32:30.382 --> 32:32.718
And everyone cheered,
and they played this
crazy surfer music,

32:32.751 --> 32:34.520
and I got to throw
the ceremonial pie
in Dad's face!

32:34.553 --> 32:35.721
What?!

32:35.754 --> 32:37.356
I know! It was amazing!

You're my sister,
and I know deep in your heart

32:43.262 --> 32:46.332
you want to watch this
major cultural event
and eat ice cream

32:46.365 --> 32:48.700
and not just smoke
disgusting cigarettes...
Shut up!

32:48.734 --> 32:50.369

-Go, Nancy.

they're going?

33:11.123 --> 33:13.325
Hey, can you see okay?
Yeah.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.660
I've got a perfect view
of the crust of Cool Whip

33:14.693 --> 33:17.096
behind your ear.
What?

33:17.696 --> 33:19.231
Here.

Don't worry about it.

is a triple flip.

-Bye.

She's a fighter.

If I know her, she's gonna
fight for every triple

33:38.484 --> 33:40.086
from here on out.
Hey, what happened?

33:40.119 --> 33:41.487
I'm sorry.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.688
I...

33:42.721 --> 33:44.823
I'll tell you later.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.494
No, not at all.
I, um...

33:48.527 --> 33:50.529
I wanted to introduce you
to everyone.

Hey, we need a tie-breaker.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.267
Are you Team Nancy
or Team Tonya?

A very difficult combination.

only three minutes.

the hardest triple --

34:07.679 --> 34:09.715

you hear a drip...

...you might want to try
a gentler approach.

by the way.

early mid-life crisis.

the trailer.

you took a risk,

34:46.652 --> 34:48.820
you got out of your
"comfort zone."

got stuck in the mud.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.129
Yeah, well,
happens to the best of us.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.331
There's no shame
in asking for a little help

34:59.365 --> 35:00.366
now and again.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.407
How do you know
how to do all this anyway?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.909
You come from a long line
of trailer folk?

Well, truly,
that ain't far off.

Here.
Why don't you keep this.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.320
You never know
when it's gonna come in handy.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.927
Nope. [Grunts]

35:28.960 --> 35:30.562
I'm good.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.265
But you could
run out to my truck

35:33.299 --> 35:36.202
and, on the seat,
there's my tool bag.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.903
Grab me the plumber's putty
out of there.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.438

all the furniture.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.570

36:44.603 --> 36:46.004
well,
I thought Diane might notice

36:46.037 --> 36:50.376
if her antique buffet
turned up missing.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.415
Cameron:
It could work out.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.884
Rover might succeed.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.786
No, I looked at it
a couple months ago,

I'm just saying,
Dr. Katie Herman

38:05.484 --> 38:07.953
gives you a lot of
ontological attention.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.589
Yeah. She's friendly.

Oh-ho!
Nice scratch.

She's not friendly
with me.

Yeah, well,

38:16.795 --> 38:18.964
how are things with you
and Dr. Cameron Howe?

38:18.997 --> 38:21.500
Must be pretty snug out there
in that Airstream.

living in a thimble.

She's, um...

[Chuckles]

38:37.048 --> 38:38.950
She's looking for something,

38:38.984 --> 38:40.752
and I don't think
she's gonna find it
in no man's land.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.721
But, um....

38:42.754 --> 38:48.494
I feel bad,
because she's so into it, but...

38:50.396 --> 38:52.998
...I hate it out there.

And I can't stop thinking about
click beetles.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.403
[Snickers, clears throat]

38:57.436 --> 38:58.770
What's a click beetle?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.373
You call yourself
an outdoorsman.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.608
So, you're in the wild,

39:02.641 --> 39:05.143
and you hear
this clicking sound.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.778
And you think
you're going crazy

39:06.812 --> 39:08.380
or have sudden
onset tinnitus,

39:08.414 --> 39:10.148
but in fact,
there's an ear-dwelling beetle

39:10.181 --> 39:11.850
in your cochlea --

39:11.883 --> 39:14.620
I'm serious --
and you turn up dead.

39:14.653 --> 39:17.489
With a beetle
next to your head.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.691
Because, you know,
it crawls out.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.560
When you die.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.995
Joe,
that was in "Star Trek II."

39:24.029 --> 39:25.831
Never seen it.
Yes, you have.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.165
And click beetles
are real.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.600
Mm-hmm.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.604
Yes!
Nice!

39:32.638 --> 39:34.573
Wasn't aiming for that one,
but it counts.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.775
So what do you think
of Gladwell, Bristol

39:36.808 --> 39:39.010
and their smokin'
VC operation?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.447
Well, you know, I was excited
about the AOL offer.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.814
Until I wasn't.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.783
And then I was excited
about the VC route.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.652
Until I wasn't, so...

39:46.685 --> 39:50.856
What are you...
really excited about?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.624
This.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.193
You and me.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.429
Here.

39:57.463 --> 40:00.031
Okay...

40:02.901 --> 40:04.770
If you make this shot,

40:04.803 --> 40:06.171
we're taking
the VC money.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.542
Fine.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.950
Ugh!
Ooh!

40:18.984 --> 40:21.620
[Laughs]

40:21.653 --> 40:23.889
We're not taking the money.
Okay, okay. Rack 'em.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.226
Hey. Here we go.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.895
Okay, okay.
[Cheers and applause]

40:29.928 --> 40:33.532
So...[chuckles] Wow!

40:33.565 --> 40:35.767
So, uh, as you all know,

40:35.801 --> 40:39.237
we got off to
kind of a rocky start --

40:39.270 --> 40:43.241
but last month, suddenly,
you really turned it around.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.812
Huh? Just...Wow!

40:46.845 --> 40:49.114
Uh, credit goes to Cecil

40:49.147 --> 40:50.882
for his breakthrough
with the algorithm.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.551
-Yay!
-Cecil!

40:52.584 --> 40:58.524
We are so proud to offer you
Series A financing.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.825
To Rover.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.528
All: To Rover!

41:04.295 --> 41:05.564
Good job.
Thank you.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.999
Donna, hey.
Hey.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.835
I owe you an apology.

41:09.868 --> 41:13.505
I didn't see it at first,
but this thing is killer.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.240
I mean,
your guy nailed it.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.809
Yeah. He really did.
Yeah.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.745
To perseverance --
Ah.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.046
Hi.
[Chuckles]

41:21.079 --> 41:22.047
Congratulations.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.618
Well, that must feel
really good.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.954
Look, I know
it's been a tough one,

41:28.987 --> 41:30.756
and given where we were
a month ago,

41:30.789 --> 41:32.223
it must feel like
a curve ball.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.626
But it will pay off,
you'll see.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.228
[Laughs]

41:37.262 --> 41:38.564
Hey.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.900
You really pulled this off.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.268
And just in the nick.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.971
About a month ago,

41:46.004 --> 41:48.574
Donna was gonna dump
the whole thing to AOL.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.109
-It's been good for all of us.
-Oh, I agree.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.078
Man: Oh, you know
each other, right?

41:53.111 --> 41:55.146
Elias: So you really cracked
the whole thing wide open.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.648
How'd you do it?

41:56.682 --> 41:59.050
Cecil: Uh, Bos actually
had the initial idea,

41:59.084 --> 42:02.654
what we call the, uh,
the "waiting room" concept --

42:02.688 --> 42:04.122
Yeah, people wait around
all the time,

42:04.155 --> 42:05.591
they're used to it.

42:05.624 --> 42:09.060
In -- In real life.
On the web.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.863
Um, I, uh, came up with
a "queuing program."

42:11.897 --> 42:16.101
Um, Now we're the first site
to, uh, index entire pages.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.671
Um, you know, um,
we had a crawler,

42:19.705 --> 42:21.239
but it was a rude one...

42:21.272 --> 42:23.842
Sure, we had to teach that
little sucker some manners.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.644
[Laughter]

42:25.677 --> 42:27.145
Tanya: Excuse me.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.581
I just wanted to thank you.
For not giving up on us.

42:29.615 --> 42:30.982
Uh, you steered the ship.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.884
You should be
proud of yourself.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.119
Hey.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.154
So, you're
the star of the show.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.823
Y-Yeah.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.325
The, uh -- the growth
has been incredible.
Yeah.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.628
Well, I was just
a little bit surprised.

42:42.661 --> 42:45.130
Because, well, you know,
you'd struggled for so long.

42:45.163 --> 42:48.634
So I just --
I have to ask...

42:48.667 --> 42:50.602
Who wrote
the new algorithm?

42:50.636 --> 42:53.872
**

42:53.905 --> 42:55.273
I cannot believe

42:55.306 --> 42:57.643
that Rover is getting
a Series A term sheet.

42:57.676 --> 42:59.044
Now, all of a sudden,

42:59.077 --> 43:00.812
we're up against this
capitalized nightmare.

43:00.846 --> 43:06.151
Some new "crawler" interacting
with the data indexing,

43:06.184 --> 43:07.786
it could kill us...

43:07.819 --> 43:10.856
We've got to divide our focus
just to compete.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.358
But our whole approach,
the human touch,

43:13.391 --> 43:16.027
it's -- it's now completely
and totally f--

43:18.263 --> 43:24.135
**

43:28.206 --> 43:38.183
**

43:38.216 --> 43:47.893
**
